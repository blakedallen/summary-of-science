The\nsummer monsoon (southwest monsoon) usually starts by the end of May and continues\nuntil November. The winter monsoon (northeast monsoon) commences toward the end of\nNovember and continues until April. During summer monsoon, winds are mainly\nsouthwesterly or westerly and during winter monsoon, the prevailing winds are mostly\nnortheasterly. The southwest (summer) and the northeast (winter) monsoons influence\nweather and climate between 300N and 300S over the African, Indian, and Asian landmasses (Reddy and Salvekar, 2003). Accurate long lead prediction of monsoon rainfall\ncan improve planning to mitigate the adverse impacts of monsoon variability and to take\n1\n\n\fadvantage of the beneficial conditions (Reddy and Salvekar, 2003). The variability in the\nmonsoon rainfall depends heavily upon the sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly over\nthe Indian Ocean (Clark et al, 2000). Several authors, for example Nicholls (1983),\nBranstator (1985), Clark et al (2000), Lau and Weng (2001), Guo et al (2002), Barsugli\nand Sardeshmukh (2002), Hartmann et al (2007), have discussed the association between\nSST anomaly and rainfall. The SST anomalies cause local changes in the low-level\ntemperatures, winds, and humidity, usually leading to precipitation anomalies in the\nvicinity of the SST anomaly (Barsugli and Sardeshmukh, 2002). Gradients of SST within\nthe oceans are important in determining the location of precipitation over the Tropics,\nincluding the monsoon regions (Clark et al, 2000).\nAs the extra tropical circulation anomalies display energy dispersion away from the\nregion of anomalous tropical convection, they are interpreted as a Rossby wave response\nto the latent heat release associated with the tropical convection (Ferranti et al., 1990). In\nregions of anomalous tropical heating, there is a dynamical response with anomalous\nlarge-scale ascent and upper tropospheric divergence, which acts as a Rossby wave\nsource (Sardeshmukh and Hoskins, 1988) for extra tropical waves. Conversely, in regions\nof reduced convection and anomalous cooling, the tropical responses are the anomalous\ndescent and upper-tropospheric convergence (Matthews et al, 2004). Positive (negative)\nsea surface temperature (SST) anomalies lead the enhanced (suppressed) MJO convection\nby approximately 10\u201312 days (a quarter cycle), consistent with the atmosphere\nresponding to the ocean forcing (Matthews, 2004). The SST anomalies themselves have\nbeen simulated in thermo dynamical ocean models as the response to the observed\nanomalous surface fluxes of latent heat and short-wave radiation (Matthews, 2004;\nShinoda and Hendon, 1998) without the need to a mass flux approach and closed on\nbuoyancy. SST anomalies has been addressed by Woolnough et al. (2001), who\nexamined the equilibrium response to an idealized, eastward-propagating equatorial SST\ndipole anomaly in an \"aquaplanet\" atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM).\nThe southwest (summer) and the northeast (winter) monsoons influence weather and\nclimate between 300N and 300S over the African, Indian and Asian landmasses. Sea\nSurface Temperature (SST) anomalies influence the atmosphere by altering the flux of\nlatent heat and sensible heat from the ocean (Holton, 1972). The efficiency of such\nanomalies in exciting global scale responses depends on their ability to generate Rossby\nwaves. In the extra tropics SST anomalies primarily generate low-level heating and this is\nbalanced by horizontal temperature advection. In the tropics, positive SST anomalies are\nassociated with enhanced convection and the resulting heating is balanced by adiabatic\ncooling. SST anomalies also play an important role in producing rainfall (Reddy and\nSalvekar, 2003).\nEl-Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a coupled Ocean-atmosphere phenomenon that\nhas worldwide impact on climate in general and Indian monsoons in particular. The\noscillations in wind stress owing to the Southern Oscillation are associated with changes\nin the circulation of the ocean and the SST anomaly that are referred to as El-Nino. This\nterm was originally applied to a warming of the coastal waters of Peru and Ecuador,\nwhich occurs annually near Christmastime. ENSO's maximum SST anomalies occur in\nthe equatorial eastern and central Pacific, ENSO affects the global ocean (Wang et al,\n2006). Outside the tropical Pacific significant ENSO related SST anomalies are found\nover many places, such as in the tropical North Atlantic, the tropical Indian Ocean, the\n\n2\n\n\fextratropical North and South Pacific, and the South China Sea. The strength of ENSO is\nmeasured by two principle indices namely Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and SST\nindex over Nino-3.4 region, which refers to, the anomalous SSTs within the region\nbounded by 50oN-50oS and 170oE-120oW. Warm ENSO episodes are charactersied by\nincreased number and intensity of tropical storms over the Bay of Bengal and hence\nenhanced winter monsoon rainfall.\nThe long-recognized negative correlation between Indian monsoon rainfall and ENSO\n(Webster and Palmer, 1977) in which a weak (strong) monsoon is related to a warm\n(cold) event through an anomalous Walker cell driven by tropical east Pacific sea surface\ntemperature (SST) anomalies, has weakened rapidly since the late 1970s (Chang et al,\n2001). This weakened relationship is defined by the correlation between June and\nSeptember all-India rainfall and Ni\u00f1o-3 (5\u00b0S\u20135\u00b0N, 150\u00b0\u201390\u00b0W) SST (Chang et al, 2001).\nA handful of significant studies are available where the relationship between SST and\nrainfall has been studied (e.g. Uvo et al, 1989; Nobre and Srukla, 1996). Chongyin\n(1990) investigated the relationship between El-Nino event and winter monsoon over\nsouth east Asia.\nPresent paper attempts to develop a predictive model for winter monsoon over India\nusing SST anomaly as one of the predictors. Some significant studies in the field of\nwinter-monsoon over East Asia and its association have been reviewed. The literatures\ninclude Zhang et al (1997), Wen et al (2000), and Quiaoping et al (2007). However,\nlimited studies could be identified where prediction of winter-monsoon over India has\nbeen discussed. Finally, we decided to generate a predictive model for winter-monsoon\nover India. From the above discussion and the literatures mentioned above we felt the\nnecessity of incorporating SST anomaly as a predictor. Since artificial neural network\n(ANN) is being attempted in several papers dealing with complex non-linear\nmeteorological events (e.g. Elsner and Tsonis, 1992), we decided to attempt an ANN in\nthis problem. The subsequent sections are organized as follows: Section 1.1 discusses\nsome literatures in the application of ANN in rainfall prediction. Section 2 describes the\ninputs to the model and examines the structure of the time series under consideration.\nSection 3 generated a non-linear multiple regression model in the form of exponential\nregression. Section 4 develops and describes the ANN model and Section 5 makes a\nstatistical assessment of the predictions from regression and ANN. The conclusion is\npresented in Section 6.\n\n1.1\n\nArtificial Neural Network in rainfall prediction \u2013 a brief overview\n\nAccurate rainfall predictions are essential for planning day-to-day activities. Several\npapers are available where the rainfall time series have been dealt with statistically\n(Wilks, 1991; Ward and Folland, 1991; Bell and Suhasini, 1994). Present paper\nendeavors to develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to forecast average\nwinter shower in India. The ANN technique is widely accepted as a potentially useful\nway of modeling complex non-linear and dynamic systems for which a large amount of\ndata is used (Hsieh and Tang, 1998; Hornik, 1991). It is particularly useful, where the\nunderlying physical processes or relationships are not fully understood or may display\nchaotic properties (Sivakumar, 2000). Conventional weather forecasting models are\nhighly data specific and based on complex and expensive to maintain mathematical\nmodels that are built many months in advance of the events. ANN offer real prospects for\n\n3\n\n\fan effective, more flexible, less assumption dependent adaptive methodology well suited\nfor modeling weather forecasting which by its nature are inherently complex because of\nnon-linearity and chaotic effects (Maqsood et al, 2002). The ANN is based on biological\nneural systems (Kartalopoulos, 2000). It is highly vital with respect to underlying data\ndistribution and no assumptions are made about relationships between variables. The\nbasic unit of ANN is the artificial neuron, which stimulates the four basic functions of\nnatural neurons. The artificial neurons are much similar than biological neuron. The input\nlayers consist of neuron that received input from the external environment. The output of\nthe system layer consists that communicate the output of the system to the user of the\nexternal environment. There are usually numbers of hidden layers between these two\nlayers. To determine the number of hidden neurons the network should have perform its\nbest, are often left out to the method trial and error. Usually the available data are\nseparated into training set and test set. The optimal weights are obtained by using 'Back\nPropagation'. The quality of the prediction is obtained from the performance with the test\nset of data. The weights are determined by iteration to produce the lowest error in the\noutput. Initial weights are randomly assigned in subsequent iterations, individual weights\nare incrementally adjusted to reduce error (Kamarthi and Pittner, 1999).\nHu (1964) initiated the execution of ANN in weather forecasting. Since the last few\ndecades, ANN has opened up new avenues to the forecasting task involving atmosphere\nrelated phenomena (Gardner and Dorling, 1998; Hsieh and Tang, 1998). Michaelides et\nal (1995) compared the performance of ANN with multiple linear regressions in\nestimating missing rainfall data over Cyprus. Kalogirou et al (1997) implemented ANN\nto reconstruct the rainfall time series over Cyprus. Lee et al (1998) applied Artificial\nNeural Network in rainfall prediction by splitting the available data into homogeneous\nsubpopulations. Wong et al (1999) constructed fuzzy rule bases with the aid of SOM and\nBack propagation neural networks and then with the help of the rule base developed\npredictive model for rainfall over Switzerland using spatial interpolation. Application of\nANN in forecasting monsoon rainfall over India is not very new. We have surveyed the\nliterature and could get some significant papers in this direction. Venkatesan et al (1997),\nSahai (2000), Chattopadhyay (2007), Guhathakurata (2008) implemented ANN based\nmethodologies in prediction of summer-monsoon rainfall over India.\n\n2.\n\nAutocorrelation structure of the time series\n\nThe present paper deals with the monthly average winter shower data and the SST\nanomaly data from 1950 to 1998. The rainfall and SST anomaly data have been collected\nfrom www.tropmet.res.in and http://jisao.washington.edu/. The winter shower (mm) and\ntropical SST anomaly (0C) has been examined for their autocorrelation pattern. We have\ncalculated autocorrelation function (ACF) (Wilks, 1995) for the average (over\nNovember-January) rainfall time series up to 25 lags and displayed in Figure 1a. This\nFigure shows that the ACF does not follow any specific sinusoidal pattern and the\nautocorrelations fall below 0.3 in numerical value. Moreover, the ACF is not decaying to\n0 with increase in the lag number. These features of the ACF indicate that the time series\ndoes not have any persistence and it is not stationary in nature. The ACF of the average\nwinter monsoon rainfall has been examined because this is the predictand of the\nmodeling problem. The monthly rainfall amounts in November, December, and January\nare also examined for their ACF and similar nature is discerned (Figures 1b-d).\n\n4\n\n\fSimilarly, the ACF are calculated for tropical SST anomaly in the said months (Figures\n2a-c) and it is revealed that ACF for the SST time series are remaining at positive level\nup to more than 10 lags. However, the ACF is lying below 0.5 in magnitude. This\nindicates that despite more positive association with past values than the winter monsoon\nrainfall no persistence exists within the time series. Like the rainfall time series, the ACF\nfor SST anomaly is not showing any sinusoidal pattern and hence it can be said that\nstationarity is not there with the SST anomaly time series. Thus, it can be said that neither\nthe time series of the predictors (i.e. rainfall amounts and SST anomaly in November,\nDecember, and January for year n) nor the time series of the predictand (i.e. average\nwinter monsoon rainfall for year (n+1)) exhibits stationarity. The non-linear association\nbetween the predictors and the predictand is also apparent from the widely distributed\ndata clouds in the scatter plot presented in Figure 3.\n\n3.\n\nMultiple non-linear regression model\n\nInitially, all of the six predictors are tested over time for their trend. Linear as well as\nnon-linear (polynomial of degree 6) trend equations (Wilks, 1995) are examined and the\ncorresponding coefficients of determination ( R 2 ) are calculated. We have presented the\nvalues of R 2 in Table 1, which shows that in all of the cases the values are small. This\nindicates the absence of any significant trend within the time series of all of the\npredictors. In the previous section, the non-stationarity of the time series under study has\nbeen revealed. It is also understandable from the ACF patterns that there are no\nseasonality and trend in the time series. Non-linear regression equations are now\ngenerated to discern the relationship between the predictors and predictands. A non-linear\nregression equation involving exponential terms is generated as follows (Chattopadhyay\nand Chattopadhyay, 2008a):\n\u0177 = \u2211 ai exp(bi xi )\n6\n\ni =1\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n(1)\n\nWhere, ai , bi are the regression parameters, and xi (i = 1,2,...,6 ) denote the six predictors\ni.e. rainfall in November, December, January, and the tropical SST anomalies in\nNovember, December, and January respectively for the year n ; in the left hand side \u0177\ndenotes the estimated average winter monsoon rainfall in the year (n + 1) . The regression\nparameters are estimated using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and iterating up to 500\nsteps. Finally, the regression parameters come out to be 0.355 (a1 ) , 0.031 (b1 ) , 4.705\n(a 2 ) , 0.018 (b2 ) , 2.505 (a3 ) , 0.056 (b3 ) , 4.730 (a 4 ) , 0.001 (b4 ) , 3.343 (a5 ) , 0.001 (b5 ) ,\n3.480 (a 6 ) , and 0.002 (b6 ) . The results would be analyzed statistically in the subsequent\nsections.\n\n4.\n\nArtificial neural network model\n\nIn the present paper, the data have been transformed to [\u2212 1,+1] before applying them to\nANN formation. An exhaustive variable selection procedure is adapted to find a good\nsubset of the full set of input variables created as a result of data analysis and\ntransformation. This selection has been done by means of genetic algorithm, where the\ncross over probability and mutation factor has been selected as 0.7 and 1 respectively.\nWhile generating the ANN model in the form of multiplayer perceptron (MLP), using a\n5\n\n\fmodified cascade method together with an adaptive gradient learning rule (Lundin et al.,\n1999). The cascade mode of construction involves adding hidden nodes, one or more than\none at a time, and always connecting all the previous nodes to the current node. The\nadaptive gradient learning rule uses back-propagated gradient information to guide an\n\n(\n\n)\n\niterative line search algorithm. Sigmoid function ( f ( x ) = 1 + e \u2212 x ) (Widrow and Lehr,\n1990) has been used as activation function for both hidden and output layer. From the\nentire dataset under consideration, we have chosen 70 per cent of the original data as\ntraining set. The training set formation has been done using the method of Round Robin\n(O'Neill and Song, 2003), which is an arrangement of choosing all elements in a group\nequally in some rational order, usually from the top to the bottom of a list and then\nstarting again at the top of the list and so on. The root mean squared error (RMSE) has\nbeen used to evaluate the model. After training, the network has been validated over the\nentire dataset. It should be mentioned that there is no strict rule to decide the ratio of\ntraining and test cases. A survey on the ANN literatures it is found that the ratios 1:1\n(Chattopadhyay and Chattopadhyay, 2008b), 7:3 (Lundin et al., 1999), and 3:1 (Perez et\nal., 2000, Perez and Reyes, 2001) are frequently used in ANN applications. In the present\npaper the approach similar to that of Lundin et al. (1999) has been adopted after\nexamining the other approaches. The ANN has been validated over the entire dataset\nunder consideration. We have started with 30 nodes in the hidden layer and after training\nthrough adaptive gradient learning, we have obtained the final structure of the MLP as 512-1. This implies that there are five units (it is reduced from six due to exhaustive\nvariable selection) in the final input set, twelve nodes in the final hidden layer, and there\nis only one output node. Results obtained from this network architecture are explained in\nthe subsequent section.\n\n5.\n\n\u22121\n\nStatistical assessment of the predictions\n\nPredicted sub ranges\n\nIn the last two sections, we have generated non-linear regression and ANN models. In the\npresent section, the results would be analyzed. A confusion matrix has been generated to\nview the prediction capacity of the ANN model. A confusion matrix (Fielding and Bell,\n1997) is a square matrix whose rows and columns represent the sub-ranges for the real\nworld target and model outputs, respectively. The value in the (i,j) position of the matrix\nis the number of records for which the real world target output is in the ith sub-range and\nwhose real world model output is within the jth sub-range. The confusion matrix for the\nANN prediction comes out to be\nActual sub ranges\nConfusion\nmatrix\n4.23 13.13 22.02 30.91 39.81 Totals\n2\n8\n0\n0\n0\n4.23\n10\n2\n10\n3\n1\n0\n13.13\n16\n0\n4\n8\n0\n0\n22.02\n12\n0\n1\n2\n2\n1\n30.91\n6\n0\n0\n2\n0\n1\n39.81\n3\nTotal\n4\n23\n15\n3\n2\n47\n\n6\n\n\fFrom the above matrix, it is found that for the sub range (4.23mm to 13.13mm) there are\nactually 23 observations and 16 predictions fall in this sub range. Thus, 69.57% accuracy\nis there for this sub range. For the sub range 13.13mm to 22.02mm, there are actually 15\nobservations and 12 predictions fall in this sub range. This means that there is 80%\naccuracy for this sub range. Thus, it can be interpreted that for higher rainfall accuracy\nthere is more possibility of accurate fore cast by ANN than in the case of lower rainfall\namounts. In the next step, the predictions are judged using scatter plot matrix presented as\nFigure 4. In this Figure it is apparent from the second panel of the first column that there\nis a good linear association between the actual and the predicted values of the monsoon\nrainfall amounts based on ANN model described above. The dense data cloud around the\nlinear trend line indicates a good linear association between the actual and the predicted\nvalues. However, there are some values deviated significantly from the trend line. Thus,\nthere are some cases where the prediction performance of the ANN is not satisfactory.\nNow, the predictions from ANN are judged case wise over the entire validation set. Line\ndiagram presented in Figure 5 shows the comparison between actual and predicted\nrainfall amounts for the validation cases. A visual inspection over Figure 5 reveals that\nfor the validation cases 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 19, 22, 23, 25, 31, 32, 33, 38, 41, 42,\n44, and 45 there is significant closeness between actual and predicted rainfall amounts.\nComputing the per centage of errors in the validation cases we find that if maximum 15%\nerror of prediction is allowed, then prediction yield is 0.30. If 20%, 25%, and 30% errors\nof prediction are allowed, then the prediction yields are 0.45, 0.55, and 0.62 respectively.\nNow we consider the predictions from the exponential regression presented in equation\n(1). Observing the scatter plot presented in Figure 4, we find that there in a near-linear\nassociation between actual and regression-predicted values of the rainfall. However, a\nvisual inspection reveals from the third row and first column of the matrix that the\nlinearity is less in this case than that in the case of ANN. To test the results statistically\nwe calculate the Willmott's index (WI) for the regression as well as ANN. The\nWillmott's index is given by (Willmott, 1982)\nN\nN\n2\n2\n...\n(2)\nWI = 1 \u2212 \uf8ee \u2211 (Pi \u2212 Oi ) / \u2211 Pi \u2212 O + Oi \u2212 O \uf8f9\n\uf8ef\uf8f0i =1\n\uf8fa\uf8fb\ni =1\nWhere, Oi , Pi , and O denote the observed value in the ith case, predicted value in the\nith case, and mean observed value respectively. The utility of WI in judging the\npredictions has been discussed thoroughly in Chattopadhyay and Chattopadhyay (2008).\nIn the present case, the WI for non-linear regression and ANN come out to be 0.672 and\n0.724 respectively. As the higher value of WI indicates better predictive model, it can be\nsaid that the ANN based predictive model performs better than non-linear regression.\nFurther, we calculate percent error of the prediction (PE) given by (Chattopadhyay, 2007)\nPi \u2212 Oi\nPE =\n\u00d7 100\n...\n(3)\nOi\n\n(\n\nWhere,\n\n)\n\nimplies the average over the whole test set. The predictive model is identified\n\nas a good one if the PE is sufficiently small. In the present case, PE for non-linear\nregression and ANN come out to be 30.96 and 27.16 respectively. This further proves\nthat ANN is performing better than regression in predicting winter monsoon rainfall. Like\nANN, the prediction yields are also calculated for the non-linear regression based\n\n7\n\n\fprediction. It is found that if 15%, 20%, 25%, and 30% errors of prediction are allowed,\nthen the prediction yields are 0.23, 0.30, 0.45, and 0.51 respectively, and each of the\nprediction yields is less than the corresponding values in the case of ANN. This further\nproves the better prediction potential of ANN than regression. For better viewing, the\nvalues of the statistical parameters are presented in Table 2.\n\n5.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe present paper dealt with the prediction of winter-monsoon rainfall time series over\nIndia. The purpose was to predict the average winter-monsoon rainfall using six\npredictors. To do the same, we considered the rainfall amounts and the sea surface\ntemperature anomalies for the winter monsoon months of a given year to predict the\naverage winter monsoon rainfall of the next year. Consequently, we had six predictors\nand one predictand. Before generation of the model, we discussed several issues\nassociated with rainfall and its relationship with sea surface temperature anomalies.\nSubsequently we surveyed the literatures dealing with the applicability of artificial neural\nnetwork to the forecasting of rainfall time series. Prior to develop a neural network model\nwe first tried a predictive non-linear multiple regression equation after thoroughly\ninvestigating the autocorrelation structures and scatter plot matrices for the predictors and\nthe predictand. The highly non-linear trends and correlations as well as absence of any\nserial correlation in the time series under study prompted us to go for a non-linear\nregression equation in the form of exponential regression. After fixing the regression\ncoefficients and the regression constant by means of Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm we\ncalculated some statistical parameters to assess the goodness of the prediction made by\nthe exponential regression. Afterwards, we developed the artificial neural network model\nmultiplayer perceptron using a modified cascade method together with an adaptive\ngradient learning rule. After training and validating through extensive variable selection\nprocedure final structure of the multiplayer perceptron was obtained as 5-12-1. The\npredictions from the neural net were also judged using the same statistical parameters,\ni.e., Willmott's index, percentage error of prediction and prediction yields. All the\nstatistical parameters revealed the supremacy of artificial neural network over\nexponential regression in predicting the winter-monsoon rainfall over India.\nSimultaneously, scatter plots were also made between the observed and predicted values\nfor both neural network and multiple regression. In the scatter plots, more linearity was\nobserved in the case of neural network that in the case of regression.\n\nReferences\nBarsugli, J.J. and Sardeshmukh, P.D., 2002, Global atmospheric sensitivity to tropical\nSST anomalies throughout the Indo-Pacific basin, Journal of Climate,\n15, 34427-3442.\nBranstor, G., 1985, Analysis of general circulation model sea-surface temperature\nanomaly simulations using a linear model.
