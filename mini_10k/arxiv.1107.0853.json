One important application of this duality is the study of the\neffective description of these strongly coupled gauge field theories\nin the long wavelength regime1 . This effective description is the\nhydrodynamic plasma description. The correspondence states that\na strongly coupled conformal field theory corresponds to a weakly\ncoupled string theory, and the latter, in a certain regime, reduces\nto the Einstein classical field equations with a negative cosmological\nconstant in an asymptotically Anti de Sitter space-time. This correspondence is suitable for describing out-of equilibrium fluid flow\n(the hydrodynamic description) which is dual to out-of-equilibrium\nlong wavelength dynamics of a black brane. An example for this\nis the fluid-gravity correspondence presented in [2]. The AdS/CFT\nduality has a remarkable application in describing strongly coupled\nQCD type plasma [3].\nThe equations governing relativistic hydrodynamics are conservation equations, namely the relativistic navier-stokes equations [4, 5].\nThose equations can be found from parts of Einstein's equations\n1 We are actually using the small Knudsen number regime, which is explained in the following chapters.\n\n1\n\n\fin the dual gravitational description [6, 7]. In this thesis we will\nproject those equations on different hyper-surfaces and verify that\nevery hyper-surface reproduce the same conservation equations.\nFrom thermodynamics we get the notion of many thermodynamic\nquantities that can be generalized for hydrodynamics, for example:\ntemperature, chemical potential and entropy current. The latter will\nbe dual to the area of a hyper-surface that admits the area increase\ntheorem. In this thesis we will explore the different hyper-surfaces\nand we will focus on two of them, namely: the event and apparent\nhorizons.\nWe will start by describing the relativistic hydrodynamic fluid\nand the derivative expansion in chapter 2. At the end of the chapter we will explain the Weyl formalism, which we will work with\nin the rest of the thesis. In chapter 3 we will set the stage for the\ngravity description and in chapter 4 we will provide basic geometric\nquantities. At the end of chapter 4 we will present parts of Einstein's equation which are dual to the conservation equations of the\nhydrodynamic fluid, and in the following two chapter 5, 6 we will\nexplore those equations for different hyper-surfaces. For this we will\nintroduce the apparent horizon hyper-surface in chapter 6. In chapter 7 we will calculate the entropy current and the temperature for\nthe apparent horizon, and we will present our conclusion in chapter\n8.\n\n2\n\n\fChapter 2\nRelativistic Hydrodynamics\n\nHydrodynamics [5] is a theoretical model which describes the behavior of fluids in motion. It treats the fluid as having local domains\nwhich are in equilibrium, hence one can define in those domains\ndefinite thermodynamic quantities such as temperature, pressure,\nentropy, etc.\nOne can address a fluid as a relativistic only if the macroscopic\nvelocity of the fluid is close to the speed of light.\n\n2.1\n\nHydrodynamics equations\n\nIn order to derive the relativistic equations of fluid dynamics we first\nneed to derive the form of the energy momentum stress tensor .\nIf we look on a d dimensional fluid element1 in its local rest frame,\nwe will realize that in that frame Pascal law is valid, which means\nthat the pressures on the different surfaces surrounding it are equal.\nTherefore, we get T ii = p. On that local frame the component T 00\nof the stress tensor is just the local internal energy density of the\nfluid \u03b5. The other components of the stress tensor are zero T 0i = 0.\nIf we introduce the d-velocity of the fluid u\u03bc , then in the local\nrest frame of the fluid we get u0 = \u22121 and ui = 0 . Then the energy\n1 Can\n\nbe understood as a volume within the fluid which contains a large number of molecules\n\n3\n\n\fmomentum stress tensor of an ideal fluid will be:\n\u03bc\u03bd\nTIdeal\n= \u03b5u\u03bc u\u03bd + p (\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd + u\u03bc u\u03bd )\n\n(2.1)\n\nIf the fluid equation of state is provided, then one can find the\nconnection between the pressure and the energy density.\nFrom the definition of the d-velocity in the local rest frame, we\ncan calculate its norm (which will be valid in any frame):\nu\u03bc u\u03bc = \u22121\n\n(2.2)\n\nWe can define the tensor which multiplies the pressure on (2.1)\nas the projector tensor P \u03bc\u03bd , because it projects along the transverse\ndirection of the fluid velocity.\nWe would like to consider a fluid which undergoes viscosity effects, so we will need to introduce a viscous stress tensor \u03c4 \u03bc\u03bd , which\nwill be added to the ideal stress tensor:\n\u03bc\u03bd\nT \u03bc\u03bd = TIdeal\n+ \u03c4 \u03bc\u03bd\n\n(2.3)\n\nWe have some freedom in the determination of the viscous stress\ntensor that we would like to set. First, we will consider the viscous\nstress tensor to be proportional to the derivatives of u\u03bc (x). Second,\nwe will need to consider how viscosity will affect the fluid in its local\nrest frame. In order to do so we will require that the energy density\nand the momentum densities in the local rest frame will not change\ndue to viscous effects, which means \u03c4 00 = 0, \u03c4 0i = 0, and because\nthe fluid velocity ui = 0, we have in the local rest frame of the fluid\nthe following expression:\n\u03c4 \u03bc\u03bd u\u03bd = 0\n\n(2.4)\n\nThis result is correct not only in the rest frame of the fluid but\nalso in any Lorentz frame, this result is called the Landau-Lifshitz\n4\n\n\fframe.\nWe will also specify the equations of motion that can be written\nin a simple form, because they are just the conservation equations\nof the stress tensor:\n\u2202\u03bc T \u03bc\u03bd = 0\n\n2.2\n\n(2.5)\n\nHydrodynamics as an effective Conformal Field Theory\n\nWhen working in the regime of small Knudsen number (long wavelength) the relativistic field theory has a relativistic hydrodynamic\ndescription [4].\nThe Knudsen number is just the correlation length of the fluid\n`cor divided by the characteristic length scale L of the variations\nof the macroscopic fields, so we can write the condition of effective\nhydrodynamics description as:\n`cor\n\u001c1\n(2.6)\nL\nUnder this condition we can expand the stress tensor in a small\nparameter Kn \u001c 1 and get:\nKn =\n\nT\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(x) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nTl\u03bc\u03bd (x) ,\n\nTl\u03bc\u03bd \u223c (Kn)l\n\n(2.7)\n\nl=0\n\nwhere Tl\u03bc\u03bd (x) is determined locally by the value of the velocity\nu\u03bc (x), the pressure p (x)2 and their derivatives. For example the\nzeroth order will be the ideal with no derivatives.\nIf we consider a relativistic Conformal Field Theory with a finite\ntemperature T , we get:\nT\u03bc\u03bc = 0\n(2.8)\n2 We\n\nare assuming that the equation of state has been given.\n\n5\n\n\fTherefore, we can find the equation of state from this condition\n\u03b5\n. From dimensional analysis we have p = aT d\nand we get p = d\u22121\nand \u03b5 = (d \u2212 1) aT d where a is a normalization coefficient. Then\nequation (2.1) takes the form:\n\u03bc\u03bd\nTIdeal\n= aT d (\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd + du\u03bc u\u03bd )\n\n(2.9)\n\nIn order to find the viscous stress tensor \u03c4 \u03bc\u03bd , we will use the conformality requirement (2.8), from which we will see that the viscous\nstress tensor has to be traceless, i.e., \u03c4\u03bc\u03bc = 0. In addition, if we apply\nthe equations of motion (2.5) to the zeroth order stress tensor, we\nget a connection between the derivatives of the velocity of the fluid\nu\u03bc (x) to the derivatives of the fluid temperature T (x), so we can\nreplace, in the next order, the derivatives of T (x) with the derivatives of u\u03bc (x).

This duality relates a particular\nstrongly coupled non-abelian gauge theory in d dimensions to string\ntheory, which in a certain regime reduces to classical gravity in d + 1\ndimensions. The regimes we will work with are the planar limit\nin the field theory and the long wavelength regime. The latter is\na small Knudsen number regime, and the CFT can be described\neffectively by a hydrodynamic description. Hence, we have a duality\nbetween a d-dimensional relativistic fluid to a classical gravity in\nd + 1 dimensions which is just Einstein's equations with a negative\ncosmological constant in an asymptotically Anti de Sitter spacetime. We can describe this duality holographically and relate to the\nfluid as \"living on the boundary\" of the whole d+1 space-time, which\nwe will refer to as the bulk. Moreover, the small Knudsen number\nsuggests an expansion of the fields, from both side of the duality, in a\nderivative expansion. This will allow us to solve Einstein's equations\norder by order. It turns out that parts of Einstein's equations at\na certain order implement the stress tensor conservation equations\nof the fluid at a lower order. This statement will be checked in the\nfollowing chapters, but not before we will give the basic set up of\n\n11\n\n\fthe bulk space-time geometry in this chapter. Two reviews on the\ngauge/gravity duality can be found in [11, 12].\n\n3.1\n\nPreliminaries: Schwarzschild black holes in AdSd+1\n\nWe would like to look at the dual description of fluid from the gravity\nperspective. In order to do so, we will have to solve Einstein's\nequations with a negative cosmological constant with a particular\nchoice of units (RAdS = 1) and we get:\n\nEab = Rab \u2212 21 Rgab \u2212\n\nd(d\u22121)\ngab\n2\n\n=\u21d2 Rab + dgab = 0,\n\nmatter\n= Tab\n=0\n\nR = \u2212d (d + 1)\n\n(3.1)\n\nOne solution to these equations is just the AdSd+1 solution which\nis dual to a vacuum state in the CFT. Another class of solutions is\ndescribed by the \"boosted Schwarzschild black branes\",\n\nds2 = \u22122u\u03bc dx\u03bc dr \u2212 r2 f (br) u\u03bc u\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + r2 P\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd\n\n(3.2)\n\nwith,\n\nf (r) = 1 \u2212\n\nb=\n\nd\n,\n4\u03c0T\n\n1\n,\nrd\nui\n\n\u0001\nu\u03bc = \u03b3, \u03b3ui ,\n\u00012\n\n= ui ui\n\n\u03b3=q\n\n1\n1 \u2212 (ui )2\n(3.3)\n\nThis solution is dual to a CFT at a finite temperature T , where\nthe velocity ui and the temperature are constants.\nThe metrics (3.2) describe the uniform black brane in an asymptotically Anti de Sitter space-time written in the ingoing Eddington-\n\n12\n\n\fFigure 3.1: Penrose diagram of the uniform black brane and the causal structure\nof the space-times dual to fluid mechanics illustrating the tube structure.

The parameters are just the temperature\nand the d parameters which define the d-velocity, so we have d + 1\nparameters, and because of the normalization (2.2) they are reduced\nto d parameters.\nIf we had written the solution in Schwarzschild type coordinates2\nwe could easily have read from the metric the location of the event\nhorizon r = 1b . One can look on the left image of figure 3.1 in order\nto understand in a pictorial way the casual structure of space-time.\n1 These coordinates exhibit a regular solution at the event horizon for all orders of expansion.\n2 The unboosted solution in Schwarzschild type coordinates\n\ndr2\n+ r2 \u03b4ij dxi dxj\nr2 f (br)\nis Kronecker's delta.

In order to do so, we promote the parameters\nto be dependent on the boundary coordinates x\u03bc , but not on the\nradial direction r, and we get from (3.2):\n\nds2 = \u22122u\u03bc (x\u03b1 ) dx\u03bc dr\u2212r2 f (b (x\u03b1 ) r) u\u03bc (x\u03b1 ) u\u03bd (x\u03b1 ) dx\u03bc dx\u03bd +r2 P\u03bc\u03bd (x\u03b1 ) dx\u03bc dx\u03bd\n(3.4)\n(0)\n\u03b1\n\u03b1 3\nHowever (3.4), denoted as g (u (x ) , b (x )) , is not a solution\nof Einstein's equations.\nThe procedure to satisfy Einstein's equations goes as follow:\n1.\n\nExpand the velocity and temperature fields in a small parameter.\n\n2.\n\nUse the ansatz so that after a while the system relaxes and go\nback to the static solution (3.2).\n\n3.\n\nCalculate the metric order-by-order to satisfy Einstein's equations.\n\nWe will do the expansions in the manner of effective field theory.\nAs we have done in (2.7), we will take all possible derivatives along\nthe boundary coordinates (i.e., x\u03bc ) to get the expansions,\nu\u03bc (x\u03b1 ) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nu\u03bc(l) (x\u03b1 ) ,\n\nl=0\n\nb (x\u03b1 ) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nb(l) (x\u03b1 )\n\n(3.5)\n\nl=0\n\nIt is possible to prove that every derivative will come with a\nfactor of b, and if the fields are changing slowly when looking on a\nlarge length scale L, we have that every term in the expansions is\n3 Consider\n\nthe fields as the zeroth order of 3.5\n\n14\n\n\fFigure 3.2: Cartoon of 'tubewise approximation' of slowly-varying configuration\nby a corresponding piecewise-constant one.

In other words, in order that these\nexpansions be justified we will require the Knudsen number to be\nsmall 2.6.\nThis regime of expansions can be visualized as tubes that go\nalong the radial direction and their basis is on the boundary (figure\n3.1 right picture). In those tubes we can define a definite velocity\nand definite temperature (figure 3.2).\nNow we will plug the expansions (3.5) into the metric and get\nP\n(l)\ngab = \u221e\nl=0 gab . Then we will require that this metric solves Einstein's equation and we can determine the metric order-by-order in\nan iterative form.\nThe Einstein's equations can be written in the form:\nh\n\nH g\n\n(0)\n\n\u0010\n\u0011i\n(n)\n\u03bc\nb(0) , u(0) gab (x\u03b1 ) = sn\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere H is a linear second order differential operator in the r variable\nalone. Note that it does not depend on n, so that it is the same\noperator in any order of the expansion. Moreover, the precise form\nof this operator at the point x\u03bc depends only on the values of b(0)\nand u\u03bc(0) at x\u03bc but not on the derivatives of these functions at that\npoint. The source term sn is a regular source term which contains\n15\n\n\fcomplicated combinations of derivatives of the fields and the fields\nthemselves and it is different in any order of expansion.\nIt turns out that it is possible to classify Einstein's equations into\ntwo categories:\n1.\n\nthe constraint equations E\u03bcr = 0.\n\n2.\n\nthe dynamical equations Err = 0, E\u03bc\u03bd = 0.\n\nThe d constraint equations are defined as the equations that are\nof first order in r derivatives. It follows that they are connecting\nthe derivatives of the temperature field with the derivatives of the\nvelocity field. Hence we can use them in order to eliminate the\ntemperature derivatives in all order of expansion.

To do that one has to\nsolve the Einstein equations. However, it is possible to consider slices\nof that manifold, for instance hyper-surfaces. Einstein's equations\nprojected onto a hyper-surface take a simpler form called the GaussCodazzi equations.\nIn order to understand the geodesic dynamics on hyper-surfaces\nof the space-time geometry (Gauss-Codazzi equations), we need to\nintroduce some basic quantities that characterize the hyper-surfaces\n[14] (induced metric, extrinsic curvature, etc.).\n\n4.1\n\nGeometric Preliminaries\n\nA hyper-surface is a sub-manifold that can either be space-like, timelike, or null1 (we will almost not deal with the latter in this section).\nA particular hyper-surface S is selected either by imposing a restriction on the coordinates, \u03a6 (xa ) = 0, or by providing a parametric\nequation of the form xa = xa (y \u03bc ).\nThe normal vector to the surface S is defined by \u03a6,a , because the\nvalue of \u03a6 changes only in the direction orthogonal to S.\n1 For\n\nthe null case refer to [15, 16]\n\n19\n\n\fA unit normal m\u0302a is defined by:\n\u03a6,a\nm\u0302a = p\nab\n|g \u03a6,a \u03a6,b |\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere we demand that m\u0302a point in the direction of increasing \u03a6:\nm\u0302a \u03a6,a > 0, and we get its norm to be:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\u22121 if S is space \u2212 like\na\nm\u0302 m\u0302a =\n\uf8f3+1 if S is time \u2212 like\n\n(4.2)\n\nIn the case of a null surface we can only define a class of null\nnormal co-vectors, in the following way:\n`a = f \u03a6,a\n\n(4.3)\n\nwhere f is an arbitrary function. The norm of the class of vectors\nis:\n`a `a = 0\n\n(4.4)\n\n.\nNow we would like to define a metric that would be intrinsic to\nthe hyper-surface. The induced metric h\u03bc\u03bd to a hyper-surface S is\nobtained by restricting the line element to displacements confined\nto the hyper-surface. Using the parametric equations xa = xa (y \u03bc ),\nwe find that the vectors,\nea\u03bc =\n\n\u2202xa\n\u2202y \u03bc\n\n(4.5)\n\nare tangent to curves contained in S. (This means that ea\u03bc m\u0302a =\n02 ). Therefore, we now write the restriction of the line element for\ndisplacements within S:\na\n\n\u2202x \u2202\u03a6\n= 0 \u221d \u2202y\n\u03bc \u2202xa =\ndirections of the surface.\n2 ea m\u0302\n\u03bc a\n\n\u2202\u03a6\n\u2202y \u03bc\n\n= 0. It is zero because the function is constant in the\n\n20\n\n\fds2 = gab dxa dxb\n\u0013\u0012 b\n\u0013\n\u0012 a\n\u2202x \u03bd\n\u2202x\n\u03bc\n= gab\ndy\ndy\n\u2202y \u03bc\n\u2202y \u03bd\n= h\u03bc\u03bd dy \u03bc dy \u03bd\n\n(4.6)\n\nh\u03bc\u03bd = gab ea\u03bc eb\u03bd\n\n(4.7)\n\nwhere\n\nNote that the induced metric is a scalar under bulk space-time\n0\ncoordinate transformations, xa \u2192 xa . However, it transforms as\na tensor under the hyper-surface coordinate transformations, y \u03bc \u2192\n0\ny\u03bc .\nWith the aid of the induced metric we can write the decomposition of the bulk metric:\ng ab = hab \u00b1 m\u0302a m\u0302b\n\n(4.8)\n\nhab = h\u03b1\u03b2 ea\u03b1 eb\u03b2\n\n(4.9)\n\nwith:\n\nwhere the plus sign in (4.8) represents the time-like hyper-surfaces,\nand the minus represents the space-like hyper-surfaces.\nThis decomposition can be defined to every hyper-surface that is\nnot null.\nWe now would like to understand how tangent tensor fields are\ndifferentiated. First we define such fields:\nA tangent tensor field Aab*** is a tensor field that is defined only\non S and is purely tangent to the hyper-surface. Such fields admit\nthe following decomposition:\n\n21\n\n\fAab*** = A\u03bc\u03bd*** ea\u03bc eb\u03bd * * *\n\n(4.10)\n\nEquation (4.10) implies that Aab*** m\u0302a = Aab*** m\u0302b = * * * = 0 which\nconfirm that Aab*** is tangent to the hyper-surface. The tangent\ntensor A\u03bc\u03bd indices are lowered and raised with the induced metric\non the hyper-surface h\u03bc\u03bd and h\u03bc\u03bd .\nNow we can define an intrinsic covariant derivative. We will\nuse a tangent vector field for simplicity: Aa = A\u03bc ea\u03bc , Aa m\u0302a =\n0, A\u03bc = Aa ea\u03bc . The intrinsic covariant derivative of A\u03bc is defined\nby the projection of Aa;b onto the hyper-surface:\nA\u03bc|\u03bd \u2261 Aa;b ea\u03bc eb\u03bd\n\n(4.11)\n\nIt is possible to prove that equation (4.11) can take the form of,\nA\u03bc|\u03bd \u2261 A\u03bc,\u03bd \u2212 \u0393\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd A\u03c3\n\n(4.12)\n\n\u0393\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd = h\u03c3\u03bb (h\u03bc\u03c3,\u03bd + h\u03bd\u03c3,\u03bc \u2212 h\u03bc\u03bd.\u03c3 )\n\n(4.13)\n\nwhere\n\nWe can now introduce the extrinsic curvature of a hyper-surface,\nwhich is just the projection of the covariant derivative of the normal\nto the hyper-surface onto the hyper-surface S:\nK\u03bc\u03bd \u2261 m\u0302a;b ea\u03bc eb\u03bd\n\n(4.14)\n\nThis quantity is a symmetric tensor and it tells us how the hypersurface S is embedded in the bulk. We can see this by taking its\ntrace: K = h\u03bc\u03bd K\u03bc\u03bd = m\u0302a;a (we used the decomposition equation\n(4.8)) which is the expansion3 of a congruence of geodesics that\nintersect the hyper-surface S orthogonally. When K > 0 (the con3 This\n\nterm will be explained in chapter 6.\n\n22\n\n\fgruence is diverging), the hyper-surface is convex and if K < 0 (the\ncongruence is converging), the hyper-surface is concave.\n\n4.2\n\nGauss-Codazzi equations\n\nWe are ready to introduce the Einstein equations on a hyper-surface\nS. We start by defining a purely intrinsic curvature tensor by the\nrelation:\n\u03c3\nA\u03c3|\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 A\u03c3|\u03bd\u03bc = R\u03bb\u03bd\u03bc\nA\u03bb\n\n(4.15)\n\nwhere the explicit expression for the purely intrinsic curvature tensor\nis:\n\u03c3\nR\u03bb\u03bd\u03bc\n= \u0393\u03c3\u03bb\u03bc,\u03bd \u2212 \u0393\u03c3\u03bb\u03bd,\u03bc + \u0393\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd \u0393\u03b1\u03bb\u03bc \u2212 \u0393\u03c3\u03b1\u03bc \u0393\u03b1\u03bb\u03bd\n\n(4.16)\n\nWe now want to establish a connection between the intrinsic curvature tensor to the Riemann curvature tensor defined in the bulk\ngeometry of space-time. It can be proven [14] that the relation is:\n\n\u0001\nd\n\u03c3\nRabc\nea\u03b1 eb\u03b2 ec\u03b3 = R\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\ned\u03c3 \u00b1 K\u03b1\u03b2|\u03b3 \u2212 K\u03b1\u03b3|\u03b2 m\u0302d \u00b1 K\u03b1\u03b2 m\u0302d;c ec\u03b3 \u2213 K\u03b1\u03b3 m\u0302d;b eb\u03b2\n(4.17)\nwhere again the plus sign represents the time-like hyper-surfaces and\nthe minus represents the space-like hyper-surfaces.\nProjecting along md and using the symmetry of Riemann curvature tensor4 gives:\nRadcb m\u0302d ea\u03b1 eb\u03b2 ec\u03b3 = K\u03b1\u03b2|\u03b3 \u2212 K\u03b1\u03b3|\u03b2\n\n\u0001\n\n(4.18)\n\nWe will now contract the indices by using the metric h\u03b1\u03b3 with\nequation (4.18). Then, by using equation (4.8) and the symmetry\nof Riemann curvature tensor, we get:\n4R\n\nabcd\n\n= \u2212Rbacd = \u2212Rabdc = Rcdab\n\n23\n\n\f\u03b1\nRab m\u0302a eb\u03b2 = K\u03b2|\u03b1\n\u2212 K,\u03b2\n\n\u0001\n\n(4.19)\n\nIf we look at the bulk metric gab contracted with m\u0302a eb\u03b2 we get,\ngab m\u0302a eb\u03b2 = m\u0302b eb\u03b2 = 0\n\n(4.20)\n\nThis means that we can replace the left hand side of (4.19) with\n(Rab + Cgab ) m\u0302a eb\u03b2 , where C is an arbitrary coefficient, because every\nterm that is proportional to the metric will vanish. For instance,\nwe can replace the left hand side with the Einstein tensor Gab =\nRab \u2212 12 Rgab to get the Gauss-Codazzi equations,\n\u03b1\nGab m\u0302a eb\u03b2 = K\u03b2|\u03b1\n\u2212 K,\u03b2\n\n(4.21)\n\nBecause we are solving the Einstein equations with a cosmological\nconstant we would like to replace the left hand side of (4.19) with\nEab , which we introduced in equation (3.1), and we get,\n\u03b1\nEab m\u0302a eb\u03b2 = K\u03b2|\u03b1\n\u2212 K,\u03b2\n\n(4.22)\n\nAs mentioned in the equations (4.21) and (4.22) we are eventually\nreducing these equations, because of (4.20), to (4.19) and these are\nthe equations we have to solve in order to find the geodesic dynamic\nequations.\n\n4.3\n\nThe Constraint equations\n\nIn the previous chapter we stated and showed that Einstein's equations can be divided into two categories, the dynamical equations\nand the constraint equations. In this section we will deal with the\nlatter.\nClaim: The constraint equations E\u03bcr = 0 with the metric (3.7),\nwhich solves the dynamic Einstein's equation, can be written in the\n24\n\n\fform:\nEab \u03be b ea\u03bc = 0\n\n(4.23)\n\nwhere \u03be b is normal to any hyper-surface S (time-like, space-like and\nnull) that is defined by \u03a6 = r \u2212 r (x\u03b1 ) = 0. Thus \u03be b is defined by\n\u03be b = f g ba \u03a6,a , where f is an arbitrary normalization function.\nProof: Let us set f = 1 for convenience reasons and look at the\nLHS of (4.23):\n\nEab \u03be b ea\u03bc = Rab \u03be b ea\u03bc\n= ea\u03bc Rab g bc \u2202c \u03a6\n= ea\u03bc Rar \u2212 ea\u03bc Ra\u03bd \u2202\u03bd r (x\u03b1 )\n= R\u03bcr + Rrr \u2202\u03bc r (x\u03b1 ) \u2212 R\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bd r (x\u03b1 ) \u2212 Rr\u03bd \u2202\u03bc r (x\u03b1 ) \u2202\u03bd r (x\u03b1 )\n= R\u03bcr \u2212 d\u2202\u03bc r (x\u03b1 ) + d\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bd r (x\u03b1 ) \u2212 (g \u03bd\u03c3 R\u03c3r + g \u03bdr Rrr ) \u2202\u03bc r (x\u03b1 ) \u2202\u03bd r (x\u03b1 )\n= R\u03bcr + dg \u03bd\u03c3 g\u03c3r \u2202\u03bc r (x\u03b1 ) \u2202\u03bd r (x\u03b1 )\n= R\u03bcr \u2212 dg \u03bd\u03c3 u\u03c3 \u2202\u03bc r (x\u03b1 ) \u2202\u03bd r (x\u03b1 )\n= R\u03bcr\nwhere we got the fifth line by using Einstein's equations (3.1) and\nwe got the sixth line by using the relation: g \u03bc\u03bd gr\u03bd = \u2212G\u03bc\u03bd u\u03bd = 0.\nUsing the relation: E\u03bcr = R\u03bcr completes the proof.\n\u0004\nFor the non-null case we can take \u03be a = m\u0302a 5 in (4.23) and we get\nfrom (4.22) the Gauss-Codazzi equations with a vanishing matter\nstress tensor:\n\u03bd\nK\u03bc|\u03bd\n\u2212 K,\u03bc = 0\n5 Note\n\nthat the normalization function f can be different from one.\n\n25\n\n(4.24)\n\n\fIf we look at the constraint equations on the boundary with the\nnormal vector to the boundary surface \u03be a = g ar , then the constraint\nequations, according to [17], take the simple form of the equations\nof motion for the boundary fluid (2.5).\nThe constraint equations just connect the derivatives of the fluid\nd-velocity with the derivatives of the temperature (or the inverse\ntemperature b), and of course the d-velocity and the temperature\nfields depend, by our definition (3.5), on the coordinates perpendicular to the r coordinate, which are the boundary coordinates x\u03b1 .\nFor this reason we can claim that the constraint equations are the\nsame for every hyper-surface \u03a6 = r \u2212 r (x\u03b1 ) of space-time. In the\nfollowing chapters we check this claim explicitly.\n\n26\n\n\fChapter 5\nThe Second Order Constraint Equations\n\n5.1\n\nHyper-Surfaces At Constant Radial Location\n\nIn this section we will check the constraint equations to the first\norder in derivative expansion for a constant radial coordinate hypersurface, i.e., \u03a6 = r \u2212 R, where R is constant.\nFor reasons of convenience, we will write here only the zeroth and\nfirst order parts of the metric (3.7)\n\nds2 = \u22122u\u03bc dx\u03bc dr \u2212 r2 f (br) u\u03bc u\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + r2 P\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd\n(5.1)\n2\n+2r2 bF (br) \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd +\nru\u03bc u\u03bd \u2202\u03bb u\u03bb dx\u03bc dx\u03bd \u2212 ru\u03bb \u2202\u03bb (u\u03bc u\u03bd ) dx\u03bc dx\u03bd\nd\u22121\nThe components of the inverse metric to the first order are:\n2\n1\n1\n2bF (br) \u03bc\u03bd\nr\u2202\u03bb u\u03bb , g r\u03bc = u\u03bc \u2212 u\u03bb \u2202\u03bb u\u03bc , g \u03bc\u03bd = 2 P \u03bc\u03bd \u2212\n\u03c3\nd\u22121\nr\nr\nr2\n(5.2)\nOur basis vectors (4.5) are:\n\ng rr = r2 f (br)\u2212\n\ner\u03bc =\n\n\u2202R\n= 0,\n\u2202x\u03bc\n\ne\u03bd\u03bc =\n\n27\n\n\u2202x\u03bd\n= \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd\n\u2202x\u03bc\n\n(5.3)\n\n\fThe normal vector to this surface is:\ng ab \u2202b \u03a6\n1\nm\u0302a = p\n=p\ng ar\nrr\nab\n|g |\n|g \u2202a \u03a6\u2202b \u03a6|\n\n(5.4)\n\nThe components of the one-form dual to the normal vector are:\n1\n,\nm\u0302r = p\n|g rr |\n\nm\u0302\u03bc = 0\n\n(5.5)\n\nIn order that the last expression will be defined, we demand g rr 6=\n0. The surface \u03a6 is time-like if g rr > 0, or space-like if g rr < 0.\nOur goal is to write the constraint equations by using (4.24), so\nwe will need to find the extrinsic curvature of the hyper-surface.\nWe will calculate the mixed upper and lower indices of the extrinsic\ncurvature in the following way:\n\nK\u03bd\u03bc = h\u03bc\u03c3 K\u03c3\u03bd\n= h\u03bc\u03c3 m\u0302a;b ea\u03c3 eb\u03bd\n= h\u03bca m\u0302a;b eb\u03bd\n= (g \u03bca \u2213 m\u0302\u03bc m\u0302a ) m\u0302a;b eb\u03bd\n\n(5.6)\n\n= g \u03bca m\u0302a;b eb\u03bd \u2213 m\u0302\u03bc m\u0302a m\u0302a;b eb\u03bd\n= m\u0302\u03bc;b eb\u03bd\n= \u2207\u03bd m\u0302\u03bc\nwhere we used (5.3) to get the fourth line and m\u0302a m\u0302a;b = 0 to get\nthe sixth line. After applying the covariant derivative, we get:\n\nK\u03bd\u03bc = \u2207\u03bd m\u0302\u03bc = \u2202\u03bd m\u0302\u03bc + \u0393\u03bc\u03bda m\u0302a = \u2202\u03bd m\u0302\u03bc + \u0393\u03bc\u03bdr m\u0302r + \u0393\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3 m\u0302\u03c3\n\n(5.7)\n\nIn order to compute the constraint equations up to the second\norder in derivative expansion, we have to find the constraint equa28\n\n\ftions that come from the zeroth order metric, and then apply them\nto the calculation of the constraint equations that comes from the\nfirst order metric.

In order to do so, we need to use the property in which\n31\n\n\fwe can explicitly calculate the r derivatives of tensors which have\nbeen calculated in the bulk. For instance, the constraint equations,\nE\u03bcr = R\u03bcr = 0 can have the following form:\n\nR\u03bcr =\n\nX\n\ngi (r, b) hi\u03bc (\u2202u (x) , \u2202b (x) , \u2202\u2202u (x) , \u2202\u2202b (x) , higher terms)\n\ni\n\n(5.18)\nNote that in this expression there are no derivatives of r because\nwe can calculate them explicitly. However, derivatives of x\u03bc can\nnot be calculated explicitly, because they are operating on arbitrary\nfunctions u\u03bc (x) , b (x).\nFor the second order constraint equations, we have no higher\nterms in the brackets of (5.18) and the answer for constant R was\ncalculated above by Gauss-Codazzi equations (5.15). From (4.19)\nand the claim in chapter 4 (4.23) we have:\n1 r(1+2)\nR\nN \u03bd\n\n\u03bc(0+1)\n\n= K\u03bd|\u03bc\n\n\u2212 K,\u03bd(0+1) = g1 (R) h1\u03bd = 0\n\n(5.19)\n\nr=R\n\nwhere:\ng1 (R) =\n\nh1\u03bd\n\n2 (bR)\n\nd\n\nd\np\n\n|f (bR)|\n\n(5.20)\n\n\u0012\n=\n2du\u03bd u\u03bc \u2202\u03bc ln b \u2212 u\u03bc \u2202\u03bc u\u03bd\n\u2212u\u03bd \u2202\u03bc u\u03bc + (d + 1) \u2202\u03bd ln b \u2212 dP\u03bd\u03bc \u2202\u03bc ln b\n\u0013\n2b\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n+ (\u2202\u03bc \u03c3\u03bd \u2212 (d \u2212 1) A\u03bc \u03c3\u03bd )\nd\n\nand\n\n32\n\n(5.21)\n\n\fN =\n\np\n|g ab \u2202a (r \u2212 r (x\u03b1 )) \u2202b (r \u2212 r (x\u03b1 ))|\n\n(5.22)\n\nTherefore, the sum in (5.18) has only one term: gi (R) = 0 \u2200i \u2265 2.\nHowever, the latter is supposed to be true for \u2200R = const. Thus:\ngi (r) = 0 \u2200i \u2265 2. Therefore, we obtain the constraint equations for\nthe second order in a derivative expansion1 which are the same for\nany non-null hyper-surface2 .\n\n1 Because\n\ng1 (R) 6= 0, we can divide the equations: g1 (R) h1\u03bd = 0 by g1 (R).\nthe constraint equations for f (bR) = 0, which is in the case of a null hypersurface, hold true and are still the same as in the non-null case [6].\nThe case in which R = 0 is not define.\n2 However,\n\n33\n\n\fChapter 6\nEvent vs Apparent Horizon\n\nIn this chapter we review the different notions of black hole horizons.\nWe will focus our discussion on two distinct horizons, namely, the\napparent and the event horizons. The last section in this chapter\nis devoted to calculating the constraint equations from the second\norder bulk metric projected on the different horizons.\n\n6.1\n\nEvent Horizon\n\nOne approach to define the unique hyper-surface that defines the\nboundary of a black hole is the causal approach. In this approach one\ndefines the unique hyper-surface, which is called the event horizon,\nas the boundary of the casual past of future null infinity [18]. This\nmathematical definition can be put in a more physical language by\nthe following statement: the event horizon is the boundary of the\nregion in space-time from which nothing can ever escape.\nWe should note here that the future null infinity is a time-like\nhyper-surface. That is because we deal with an asymptotically AdS\nspace-time, for which the future directed null geodesics (which is\nthe future null infinity in the definition) end on a time-like hypersurface.\n\n34\n\n\fOne should also note that by definition the event horizon is a null\nhyper-surface which is generated by null geodesics.\nWe would like to describe a method for finding the location of\nthe event horizon. This method requires the knowledge of the late\ntime generators of the event horizon, which means the location of\nthe event horizon in late time. The method goes as follow: evolve\nthe geodesic equation backwards in time and use the knowledge of\nthe late time generators as the future boundary condition.\nFor our metric, which describes a dynamical black hole which is\ndual to viscous fluid flow, we can assume that after a while the fluid\nrelaxes, which means that we have a stationary black hole that is\ndescribed by the metric (3.2). The location of the event horizon for\nstat\n= 1b .

The latter definition led us to the introduction of the event horizon hyper-surface in\nthe previous section. In this section we show the major drawback in\nthat definition, which leads us to a new hyper-surface, the apparent\nhorizon [19].\nIn order to find the location of the event horizon, one needs to\nknow the entire future evolution of space-time, which means that\none needs to wait infinite time in order to find the location of the\nevent horizon. To illustrate the problem, we will present the example given in [20]. Imagine a Schwarzschild black hole which has\nbeen irradiated by an infalling shell of null dust (figure 6.2). This\nis represented by the gray rectangle. The inward and outward null\ndirections are tangent to the light gray dashed lines. Note that the\ninward null direction is horizontal. In order to find the event horizon, one needs to track the evolution of radial null geodesics. If they\nfall into the singularity, they are inside the black hole and if they\nare heading outward, even after the null dust passes, then they are\noutside the black hole. If one wants to provide the location of the\nevent horizon without having any prior knowledge of the arrival of\nthe null dust, one would state that it is located at the hard dashed\nline, which is clearly a false statement. One can realize this by examining the radial null geodesic B, which seems to be escaping from\nthe black hole, but ends at the singularity. By a close examination\none sees that the location of the event horizon is the hard line. One\ncan see how it curves a bit in anticipation for the null dust to arrive,\nas if it \"knows\" that it is coming.\nWe will now explain how a new perspective on a dynamical black\nhole avoids the causal problem. This perspective is, as mentioned\nbefore, the strong gravitational field approach. In order to describe\n37\n\n\fFigure 6.2: A schematic demonstrating the non-local nature of event horizon\nevolution for a spherically symmetric space-time with the angular dimensions\nsuppressed. Horizontal location measures the radius of the associated spherical\nshell while time is (roughly) vertical. The shaded gray region represents infalling\nnull dust. (Taken from [20]).\n\nthis approach we will give an example found in [19, 20]. Imagine a\nspherical shell, in a four dimensional world, which emits light and\nthen stops. The light front null geodesics will be divided into two\nfamilies that move in two null directions: the outgoing null direction\nand the ingoing null direction. We will denote the tangent to the\nlight ray null vectors, which are perpendicular to the spherical shell\nsurface, by `a and na respectively. The outgoing light front will\nincrease in cross-sectional area and diverge, while the ingoing light\nfront will decrease in the cross-sectional area and converge. In a\nmore mathematical way, if we define the expansion parameter \u03b8 [14]\nas the fractional rate of change (per unit affine-parameter distance)\nof the congruence's (a family of geodesics that does not intersect\neach other) cross-sectional area:\n\u03b8=\n\n1 d\n\u03b4A\n\u03b4A d\u03bb\n\n38\n\n(6.6)\n\n\fFigure 6.3: An \"instant\" \u03a3t along with some of its trapped surfaces (small black\ncircles), the associated trapped region (dark gray) and the apparent horizon\n(thick dashed line). (Taken from [20]).\n\nwhere \u03bb is an affine-parameter, and \u03b4A is the infinitesimal crosssectional area measured in the purely transverse directions1 , then\nwe can describe the convergence and divergence of the light front by\nthe following:\n\u03b8(`) > 0,\n\n\u03b8(n) < 0\n\n(6.7)\n\nwhere the sub-script implies to which light front the expansion is referring to. A positive expansion means that the cross-sectional area\nwill increase while negative expansion means that it will decrease.\nNow we are ready to introduce the notion of a trapped surface:\nA trapped surface in d + 1 space-time dimensions is a space-like\nhyper-surface of d \u2212 1 dimensions, which, by definition, has two null\nnormals: the outgoing null normal `a and the ingoing null normal\nna , where the expansion in both directions is negative.\n\u03b8(`) < 0,\n\n\u03b8(n) < 0\n\n(6.8)\n\nThe hyper-surface that surrounds all of the trapped surfaces is\ncalled the apparent horizon 2 (figure 6.3) and defined mathematically\nby:\n1 The\n2 The\n\ngeodesics are crossing the cross-sectional area \u03b4A orthogonally.\napparent horizon is a special case of the so called marginally trapped surface reviewed\n\nin [21]\n\n39\n\n\f\u03b8(`) = 0,\n\n\u03b8(n) < 0\n\n(6.9)\n\nNote to the condition \u03b8(`) = 0. It does not mean that if matter\ncomes into the black-hole the apparent horizon location will not\nchange (increase)3 . If we let the apparent horizon evolve in time,\nwe get a co-dimension one tube (which means the dimensions of\nthe tube is d). The tube is built in the following manner: given a\nfoliation of space-time with d \u2212 1 hyper-surfaces S\u03bb which have two\nnull normal vectors: `a and na as defined above, we connect them\nwith an evolution vector field \u03bd a that maps every point in S\u03bb to S\u03bb+1\nto create the d-dimensional tube \u2206 (figure 6.4). The evolution vector\nis perpendicular to each of the hyper-surface S\u03bb and tangent to the\nd-dimensional tube \u2206. If the S\u03bb are the apparent horizon hypersurfaces, then we say that\u2206 is a time evolved apparent horizon 4 .\nWe will now explain about the geometric quantities that we defined. First we state that we cross normalized the null normal vectors,\n`a na = \u22121\n\n(6.10)\n\nMoreover, we present their normalization:\n`a \u2192 f `a\n\nna \u2192\n\n1 a\nn\nf\n\n(6.11)\n\nwhere f is an arbitrary function.\nThen we define the evolution vector to be normal to the S\u03bb hypersurfaces, so it will be built from the two null vectors5 `a and na :\n3 The expansion of the apparent horizon is related the expansion in the direction of the\nevolution vector \u03bd a (6.12), which is:\n\n\u03b8(\u03bd) = \u03b8(`) \u2212 C\u03b8(n) = \u2212C\u03b8(n) > 0\n4 From\n\nnow on we will refer to the time evolved apparent horizon as the apparent horizon.\nwe are using null vectors, we can always choose a normalization that will give us\nthis form of evolution vector.\n5 Because\n\n40\n\n\fFigure 6.4: A schematic of an d-tube \u2206 with compact foliation hyper-surfaces\nS\u03bb along with the outward and inward pointing null normals to those hypersurfaces. \u03bd a is the future-pointing tangent to \u2206 that is simultaneously normal\nto the S\u03bb . (Taken from [20]).\n\n\u03bd a = `a \u2212 Cna\n\n(6.12)\n\nfor some function C. Note that if C > 0, then we get space-like\nhyper-surface, if C = 0, we get a null hyper-surface and if C < 0,\nwe get a time-like hyper-surface.\nNow we can present ma , the normal to the d-tube hyper-surface\n\u2206 vector, which is perpendicular to the evolution vector and we get:\nma = `a + Cna\n\n(6.13)\n\nBecause ma is normal to the hyper-surface \u2206, which can be presented by the hyper-surface equation \u03c6 (r, x) = 0, we will choose to\ndefine it as:\nma = g ab \u2202b \u03c6\n\n(6.14)\n\nwhich is similar to what we did in (4.1) but without having to normalize it6 .\n6 Note\n\nthat ma can be space-like, time-like and even null.\n\n41\n\n\fWe pause here and return to the event horizon description. The\nevent horizon can also be described by the d-tube description and\nof course its evolution vector will be with C = 0, so we actually\nsee that both the normal vector to the hyper-surface \u2206 (the event\nhorizon) and the evolution vector are the same:\nma = \u03bd a = `a\n\n(6.15)\n\nwhere `a is defined in (4.3)7\nWe now specify some more geometric quantities and we introduce\nthe metric for the hyper-surface S\u03bb , as well:\nqab = gab + `a nb + `b na\n\n(6.16)\n\nNote that this metric has two zero eigenvalues.\nWe can associate the expansion parameters to the geometric\nquantities using the following definition:\n\u03b8(`) = q ab \u2207a `b ,\n\n\u03b8(n) = q ab \u2207a nb\n\n(6.17)\n\nNote that q ab is defined as in (6.16), but with upper indices and\nit is not the inverse of qab 8 .\nNow we are ready to return to the causal problem (the global\ndefinition of the event horizon) presented earlier and see whether\nwe can provide a solution to it. One can see (figure 6.5) that the\napparent horizon changes only when the null dust comes in, as opposed to the event horizon that \"anticipates\" the arrival of the null\ndust, and curves even before it arrives. Therefore, we have found a\nsolution to the problem. Note that the apparent horizon is located\ninside the black hole, which means that it lies within the event horizon. Moreover, the apparent and the event horizons are the same\n7 In\n\nthe rest of the section we will set the normalization of f in (4.3) to one.\ncan think of q ab as a projection onto the S\u03bb hyper-surfaces, which in (6.17) restricts\n\u2207a `b and \u2207a nb to the hyper-surfaces. The expansion \u03b8 is the trace after the restriction.\n8 One\n\n42\n\n\fFigure 6.5: A simulation similar to that of Figure 4 though this time two distinct\nshells fall into the black hole. Both the apparent and event horizons are plotted.\n(Taken from [20]).\n\nin the stationary case; one can see this by looking at their location\nafter the two null dusts pass (figure 6.5).\nWe want to find the location of the apparent horizon in the same\nmanner that we did for the event horizon, by using a derivative\nexpansion:\n\u03b1\n\nrAH (x ) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(l)\n\nrAH (x\u03b1 )\n\n(6.18)\n\nl=0\n\nFrom the requirement \u03b8(`) = 0 we can find the location order by\norder.\nHowever, in order to do so we need to foliate space-time with\nd \u2212 1 hyper-surfaces S\u03bb . We define those surfaces by specifying\nthe two null vectors to the surfaces. The symmetry of space-time\nsingles out the S\u03bb hyper-surfaces of constant r and constant \"time\"\npropagation. The latter is an arbitrary combination of x\u03bc . The\noutward null normal `a and the inward null normal na are chosen to\n43\n\n\fbe:\na\n\n` =B\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202\n\u2202r\n\na\n\n\u0013a\n\n\u0012\n\n+N\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013a\n\nn =\u2212\n\n\u2202\n\u2202r\n\n\u2202\n\u2202x\u03bc\n\n\u0013a\n(6.19)\n\n(6.20)\n\nWe can determined them by the relation (6.10) and the fact that\nthey are both null vectors and we get\nN \u03bc = u\u03bc + T \u03bc ,\n\nT \u03bc u\u03bc = 0\n\nB = \u2212N \u03bc V\u03bc\n\n(6.21)\n\n(6.22)\n\nto the second order, where T \u03bc is composed from one or two derivatives of the d-velocity or the temperature, so we have freedom in\ndetermining this quantity. We therefore require that this description be suited to describe the event horizon, because we know that\nthe apparent horizon coincides with the event horizon in the stationary case. In order to do so, we require that the null outward vector\nin the x\u03bc direction resembles the null outward vector in the x\u03bc direction that defines the event horizon. This requirement determines\nT \u03bc , and we get:\n\nT\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 1\n1\n=\n1\u2212\nbu\u03bb \u2202\u03bb u\u03bc \u2212 2\nP \u03bc\u03c1 (\u2202\u03bb \u2212 (d \u2212 3) A\u03bb ) \u03c9\u03c1\u03bb +\nbr\nr d\u22122\n\u0012 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n1\n1\n2b2\n+ 2 2L (br) +\n\u2212\nP \u03bc\u03c1 (\u2202\u03bb \u2212 (d \u2212 1) A\u03bb ) \u03c3\u03c1\u03bb +\nr\nd\u22122\nd\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 2b\n+ 1\u2212\nF (br) \u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd u\u03bb \u2202\u03bb u\u03bd\n(6.23)\nbr r\nNow we are ready to find the expansion in the outward null di44\n\n\frection:\n\n\u03b8(`) = q ab \u2207a `b\n= \u2207a `a + `a nb \u2207a `b\n= \u2202a `a + \u0393aab `b + `a nb (\u2202a `b \u2212 \u0393cab `c )\n= \u2202r `r + \u2202\u03bc `\u03bc + 2\u0393rr\u03bc `\u03bc + \u0393\u03bd\u03bdr `r + \u0393\u03bd\u03bd\u03bc `\u03bc + `\u03bd \u0393\u03bc\u03bdr `\u03bc\n\"\n!\n\u0011\n(d \u2212 1) 2 \u0010\n2 (br)d\n1\nd\n= \u2212\nr 1 \u2212 (br) \u2212\n+\n\u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 \u03c9 \u03b1\u03b2 +\nd\n(d \u2212 2) 2\n2r (br)\n!\n#\nR\n2 (br)d\u22122 K2 (br)\n2\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u2212\n(br) \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 \u03c3\n+\n+\nd\u22122\nd\u22121\n2r (d \u2212 2)\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0013\nr2 1 \u2212 (br)d \u0012\n1\n2\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u2212\n\u2212b \u2202r K1 (br) \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 \u03c3 + 3 \u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 \u03c9 (6.24)\nr\n2 (br)d\nInserting (6.18) to (6.24) and using \u03b8(`) = 0, we find order by\norder the location of the apparent horizon:\n\nrAH (x\u03b1 ) =\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n+ b (x) e\nh1 \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 \u03c3 \u03b1\u03b2 + h2 \u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 \u03c9 \u03b1\u03b2 + h3 R\nb (x)\ne\nh1 = h1 \u2212\n\nd2\n\n4\n(d \u2212 1)\n\n(6.25)\n\n(6.26)\n\nwhere h1 , h2 , h3 are defined in (6.5).\nNote that up to the first order in derivative expansion, the event\nand apparent horizons coincide.\n\n6.3\n\nEvent and Apparent Horizons Constraint Equations\n\nWe are now well equipped to check if the constraint equations for the\nevent and apparent horizons are the same up to the third order in\na derivative expansion. The work that was done in [6] showed that\n45\n\n\fthe event horizon, to the first order in derivative expansion of the\nmetric, exhibits the same constraint equations to the second order in\nderivative expansion9 , as in the case of non-null hyper-surface (5.16),\n(5.17). As we mentioned above, the event and apparent horizons\ndiffer only in the second order in derivative expansion. Therefore,\nthe constraint equations up to the second order are the same in all\nof the hyper-surfaces mentioned above. Recall our statement about\nthe ability to get the same constraint equations from different hypersurfaces10 , we see that it turns out to be right up to first order in\nthe metric.\nIn order to check this statement for the event and apparent horizons to the second order in derivative expansion of the metric, let\nus look directly at the constraint equations i.e.: E\u03bcr and calculate\ntheir difference while they are evaluated on the event and apparent\nhorizons hyper-surfaces:\n\nEH \u2212 AH = E\u03bcr\n\nr=rEH\n\n\u2212 E\u03bcr\n\nr=rAH\n\n= R\u03bcr\n\nr=rEH\n\n\u2212 R\u03bcr\n\n(6.27)\n\nr=rAH\n\nBear in mind that the difference in R\u03bcr between the event and\napparent horizons to the third order will only come from the evaluation of R\u03bcr in the bulk to the first order and from the location of\nthe horizons to the second order. Recall that the difference between\nthe horizons location is only in the second order.\nNow we present the calculation of the tensor R\u03bcr to the first order\nin the bulk:\n1 d\nR\u03bcr(1) = r\n(\u2202\u03bc ln b + du\u03c1 \u2202\u03c1 ln b \u2212 u\u03bc \u2202\u03b1 u\u03b1 \u2212 u\u03bd \u2202\u03bd u\u03bc )\nd\n2 (br)\n\n(6.28)\n\n9 The constraint equations always have one derivative more than the derivative expansion\nof the metric\n10 Actually for hyper-surfaces of the form \u03c6 = r \u2212 r (x\u03b1 ).\n\n46\n\n\fr(1)\n\nFrom Einstein's equations (3.1) we know that R\u03bc = 0 for any\nr. Therefore, the expression in the brackets in (6.28) is zero. This\nexpression is just the constraint equations we found in (5.11) and\n(5.12).\nNow we are ready to calculate (6.27) to the third order:\n\nEH \u2212 AH = R\u03bcr(1)\n\nr=rEH\n\n\u2212 R\u03bcr(1)\n\nr=rAH\n\n1\nd\n1\nd\nrEH\n\u2212 rAH\nd\n2\n2\n(brEH )\n(brAH )d\n\n=\n\n!\n(\u2202\u03bc ln b\n\n+du\u03c1 \u2202\u03c1 ln b \u2212 u\u03bc \u2202\u03b1 u\u03b1 \u2212 u\u03bd \u2202\u03bd u\u03bc )\n= 0\n\n(6.29)\n\nwhere we get the fourth line by using the constraint equation to the\nfirst order.\nThere is another method to get this result. This method is more\ncumbersome than what we presented here, however, it poses challenging computational techniques; therefore, we presented it in the\nappendix.\n\n47\n\n\fChapter 7\nHydrodynamic Quantities\n\n7.1\n\nEntropy Current\n\nIn [17] the authors introduce a boundary entropy current obtained\nfrom the event horizon by using the area of the black hole event\nhorizon. By using the connection between the area of a hypersurface to the square root of the metric determinant of that hypersurface, and by using a pull-back along ingoing null geodesics to that\narea, we get the entropy current on the boundary1 . In order to do so,\nwe split the boundary coordinate x\u03bc to (\u03bd, xi ) and we continue to use\nthe same coordinates on the hyper-surface \u03a6 = r\u2212r (x). We will get,\nas in the d-tube description, a space-like hyper-surfaces \u03a3\u03bd which is\na constant \u03bd slice. This, as well, will divide the components of m\u03bc\ninto (m\u03bd , mi )2 . After we split space-time, we define the metric on\nthe space-like hyper-surface \u03a3\u03bd by the restriction of the line element\nto be only on that hyper-surface:\nds2 = gab dxa dxb = qeij dxj dxj\n\n(7.1)\n\n1 Of course not every hyper-surface is adequate. We require that the hyper-surface admits\nthe area increase theorem, that gives us a natural candidate: the event horizon. However, it\nis not the only hyper-surface with that property.\n2 Here \u03bd does not represent d different coordinates, but a specific coordinate.

Therefore, we can say that it is\npossible to ascribe a different entropy current to the boundary by\nthe apparent horizon hyper-surface.\n\n7.2\n\nTemperature\n\nBesides the entropy current, we can relate another thermodynamic\nquantity of the fluid to gravity, that is the temperature.\nThe temperature of the black hole can be related to the surface\n\u03ba\ngravity of the event horizon by TEH = 2\u03c0\n.

The surface gravity\n(6.11) in such a way that we get: Tf luid = 2\u03c0\ntransforms in the following way:\n\u03ba0`\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd\n= f \u03ba` +\nln f\nd\u03bb\n\n(7.14)\n\nwhere f is the normalization in (6.11), \u03ba0` is the new surface gravity\nand \u03bb is an arbitrary parameter3 .\nUnder this change of the normalization f , we need to check how\nthe other quantities that we defined transform and if this transformation changes our results regarding the location of the apparent\nhorizon and the entropy current.\nThe location of the apparent horizon depends on how the expansion parameter transforms:\n0\n\u03b8(`)\n= f \u03b8(`)\n\n(7.15)\n\n3 Note that this is the transformation of the change of the parameter \u03bb, because if \u03bb \u2192 \u03bb\u2217 ,\nd\u03bb a\na\nthen `\u2217a = d\u03bb\n\u2217` \u2261 f ` .\n\n52\n\n\fand we can see that it does not change the location of the apparent\nhorizon. We can see this by trying to find the \"new\" location of the\n0\n= 0. It means that if f 6= 0, which\napparent horizon by setting \u03b8(`)\nis the trivial case, then \u03b8(`) = 0 which is exactly the \"old\" location\nof the apparent horizon.\nBy the definition of the entropy current (7.2) one can see that it\nis invariant to the normalization transformation.\n\n53\n\n\fChapter 8\nConclusions\n\nIn this thesis we presented a method and different techniques to\nevaluate properties of an out-of-equilibrium black hole that has a\ndual description as a conformal out-of-equilibrium relativistic fluid,\nwhich \"lives\" on the boundary of AdS space-time. We set the stage\nand presented the derivative expansion for both the relativistic fluid\nand for the black-hole. We presented a way to compute the Einstein constraint equations for different hyper-surfaces. The constraint equations turned out to be just the conservation equations\nof the fluid. We found, as expected, that from any hyper-surface\nwhich is located at r = r (x), we get the same conservation equations. This implies that maybe one can describe a hydrodynamic\nduality, not just from the quantities that are related to a certain\nhyper-surface, namely the event horizon, but also to quantities related to other hyper-surfaces. We suggested the apparent horizon\nas a possible candidate, and calculated from the apparent horizon\narea the entropy current and from its surface gravity the temperature for a conformal fluid. Our work poses a few future questions.\nThe first is: which hyper-surface describes correctly the conformal\nfluid properties? The second is: how can we use these results for\nthe description of the QGP (Quark Gluon Plasma)?\n\n54\n\n\fOur solution for the difference between the location and the entropy current of the event and apparent horizons is in agreement\nwith the boost invariant Bjorken flow which was done in [20, 23].\nOnly recently we came across a similar work [22] that finds the\nentropy for the apparent horizon. They used a slightly different\napproach than what we did to define the entropy current for the\napparent horizon. However, it is in complete agreement with our\nresults.\nMoreover, a recent work [23] suggests that the apparent horizon\nis a better candidate to describe the dual fluid flow at the boundary.\nThis work examines the exact solution of the conformal soliton flow,\nwhich results in the divergence of the area of the event horizon, while\nthe apparent horizon stays finite and constant. This suggests that\nthe corresponding entropy of the fluid should be described by the\napparent horizon.\n\n55\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank my thesis supervisor, Prof. Yaron Oz, who\nintroduced me to this fascinating world.

different method than what we presented in\nchapter 6 to find the constraint equations to the third order of the\nevent and apparent horizons.\nIn order to do so, we look at equation (4.23) and use (4.20) to\nget the following form of the constraint equations:\nRab ma eb\u03bc = 0\n\n(C.1)\n\nIn order to check that we get the same constraint equations from\nthe two hyper-surfaces, we calculate the difference between the constraint equations evaluated on the event horizon and the constraint\nequations evaluated on the apparent horizon, to the third order in\nderivative expansion, i.e.:\n\nEH \u2212 AH \u2261 Rab ma eb\u03bc\n\nr=rEH\n\n\u2212 Rab ma eb\u03bc\n\nr=rAH\n\n(C.2)\n\nThe quantities will be calculated from the full second order bulk\nmetric (3.7). Bearing in mind that the difference in ma only starts\n\n66\n\n\ffrom the second order, and that the difference in Rab and ea\u03bc only\nstarts from the third order, we can write (C.2) in the following\nmanner:\n\u0010\n\u0011\na(0)\n(3)\n(3)\nEH \u2212 AH =\nRa\u03bc\n\u2212\nR\na\u03bc r=rAH m\nr=rEH\n\u0010\n\u0011\na(2)\na(2)\n(1)\n+ m\n\u2212m\nRa\u03bc\n+\nr=rEH\nr=rAH\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(0)\nRab ma(0)\n+ eb(3)\n\u2212 eb(3)\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nr=rEH\nr=rAH\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(0)\na(3)\na(3)\nRa\u03bc\n+\n\u2212m\n+ m\nr=rAH\nr=rEH\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(0)\n+ ma(2) r=r \u2212 ma(2) r=r\nRab eb(1)\n+\n\u03bc\nEH\nAH\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(2)\n(2)\n+ Rab\n\u2212 Rab\nma(0) eb(1)\n\u03bc\nr=rEH\nr=rAH\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(2)\n(2)\n+ Ra\u03bc\n\u2212 Ra\u03bc\nma(1)\n(C.3)\nr=r\nr=r\nEH\n\nAH\n\nwhere the superscript refers to the order that we are evaluating the\nspecific quantities, i.e., if it is written (1) only the first derivative\nterms should be taken (no zero terms). The quantities in (C.3) that\nare outside the brackets should be evaluated at the location r = b\u22121 ,\nfor instance:\nmr(0)\n\nr=b\u22121\n\n= g rr(0)\n\nr=b\u22121\n\n= r2 f (br)\n\nr=b\u22121\n\n=0\n\n(C.4)\n\nHere we write some of the quantities that will help us to evaluate\n(C.3),\n\n(0)\n= 0,\nRrr\n\nmr(0) = 0,\n\nm\u03bd(1) = 0,\n\nm\u03bc(2)\n\n= m\u03bc(2)\n\nr=rEH\n\n,\n\nr=rAH\n(0)\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\nRr\u03bd = du\u03bd , Rr\u03bd = Rr\u03bd\n= Rr\u03bd\na(1)\nr(1)\n(0)\ne\u03bcEH/AH = e\u03bcEH/AH = \u2202\u03bc rEH/AH\n\n67\n\n(C.5)\n= 0,\n= \u2202\u03bc b\u22121 ,\n\n= er(3)\n= \u2202\u03bc r(2)\nea(3)\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\n\fWe know that only the third order terms that will be different\nare the one that are composed of the second order horizon location\nr(2) , which is different in both hyper-surfaces. For instance, the only\npart that will contribute in the third order Ricci tensor, is the Ricci\ntensor calculated to the first order in derivatives evaluated on one of\nthe hyper-surfaces and from this we will take the third order terms\n(2)\nthat come from rEH/AH .
