The field is produced by a permanent magnet enclosed\nin an inner sphere, which can rotate at a separate rate, producing a spherical Couette flow. The flow properties are investigated by measuring electric potentials on\nthe outer sphere, the induced magnetic field in the laboratory frame just above the\nrotating outer sphere, and velocity profiles inside the liquid sodium using ultrasonic\nDoppler velocimetry. The present article focuses on the time\u2013averaged axisymmetric\npart of the flow. The electric potential differences measured at several latitudes can\nbe linked to azimuthal velocities, and are indeed found to be proportional to the\nazimuthal velocities measured by Doppler velocimetry. The Doppler profiles show\nthat the angular velocity of the fluid is relatively uniform in most of the fluid shell,\nbut rises near the inner sphere, revealing the presence of a \"magnetic wind\", and\ngently drops towards the outer sphere. The transition from a magnetostrophic flow\nnear the inner sphere to a geostrophic flow near the outer sphere is controlled by\nthe local Elsasser number. For Rossby numbers up to order 1, the observed velocity\nprofiles all show a similar shape. Numerical simulations in the linear regime are\ncomputed, and synthetic velocity profiles are compared with the measured ones. A\ngood agreement is found for the angular velocity profiles.

Radial velocities change\nsign with the Rossby number, as expected for an Ekman\u2013pumping dominated flow.\nFor a given Rossby number the amplitude of the measured angular velocity is found\nto vary by as much as a factor of 3. Comparison with numerical simulations suggests that this is due to variations in the electric coupling between liquid sodium\nand the inner copper sphere, implying an effect equivalent to a reduction of the\ninner sphere electric conductivity by as much as a factor 100. We show that the\nmeasured electric potential difference can be used as a proxy of the actual fluid velocity. Using this proxy in place of the imposed differential velocity, we find that the\ninduced magnetic field varies in a consistent fashion, and displays a peculiar peak\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier\n\n10 November 2018\n\n\fin the counter\u2013rotating regime.

In recent years, attention has been\npaid to the rotating spherical Couette flow in the presence of a magnetic\nfield (Kleeorin et al., 1997; Hollerbach, 1994; Dormy et al., 1998; Starchenko,\n1998; Hollerbach, 2000; Nataf et al., 2006). An electrically conducting liquid\nfills the gap between two concentric spheres and is sheared through the differential rotation of the two spheres. A magnetic field can be applied. This\nflow has the distinct advantage of being amenable to both experiments and\nnumerical models, while retaining important ingredients of natural situations.\nNumerical simulations (Dormy et al., 1998; Hollerbach, 2000) and asymptotics\n(Kleeorin et al., 1997; Starchenko, 1998; Dormy et al., 2002) highlight the importance of the magnetic wind that arises when the magnetic field lines are\nnot parallel to the rotation axis, as for a dipolar field. This magnetic wind\ncan entrain the fluid at angular velocities larger than that of the inner sphere,\na phenomenon called super\u2013rotation (Dormy et al., 1998, 2002). The rotating spherical Couette flow has also been proposed for producing a dynamo\n(Cardin et al., 2002). Numerical models have shown that dynamo action could\nbe produced this way, even in liquids with a low magnetic Prandtl number,\nsuch as liquid metals (Schaeffer and Cardin, 2006). This has led Dan Lathrop\nand his team to build a 3m\u2013diameter sphere with a rotating inner sphere in\nthe hope of starting a dynamo, once the gap is filled with liquid sodium and\nthe differential rotation is large enough.\n\u2217 corresponding author\nEmail address: Henri-Claude.Nataf@ujf-grenoble.fr (Nataf, H.-C.).\nURL:\nhttp://www-lgit.obs.ujf-grenoble.fr/recherche/geodynamo/Epage.html\n(Nataf, H.-C.).\n\n2\n\n\fHere, we report on results obtained in the DT S (Derviche Tourneur Sodium)\nexperiment. This experiment, described in Cardin et al. (2002) and Nataf et al.\n(2006), is a rotating spherical Couette flow with an imposed axisymmetric\ndipolar magnetic field. Because of this strong imposed field, and although\nliquid sodium is used, the dynamo effect cannot be studied in the DT S experiment. However, it permits to explore very similar dynamics. In particular,\nthe magnetic field is large enough to strongly influence the flow (interaction\nparameter N up to 200) and the magnetic field is strongly affected by the flow\n(magnetic Reynolds number Rm up to 44).\nThis kind of experiment can bring information on the level and organization of turbulence in situations where both rotation and the magnetic field\nimpose strong constraints on the flow. Local theories have been proposed\n(Braginsky and Meytlis, 1990), partly backed by numerical simulations (St. Pierre,\n1996), and some teams are trying to implement sub-grid models based on these\ntheories in full dynamo models (Buffett, 2003; Matsui and Buffett, 2007). Results obtained in the DT S experiment suggest an alternative view, in which\nwaves play a major role (Schmitt et al., 2008). A good characterization of the\nmean axisymmetric flow is needed in order to fully exploit these observations.\nAn experimental setup, built by Dan Lathrop and his group (Sisan et al., 2004;\nKelley et al., 2007) is very similar to our DT S experiment. The main difference\nis that an axial magnetic field is applied by external coils in Sisan et al. (2004)\nand Kelley et al. (2007), while we impose a strong dipolar magnetic field in\nDT S since the inner sphere contains a permanent magnet. One of the consequences is that the entrainment of the conducting fluid is much stronger, since\nthe inner sphere acts as a magnetic stirrer. We also have developed specific\ninstrumentation, such as measuring the electric potential at the surface of the\nouter sphere, which carries important information on the flow (Nataf et al.,\n2006; Schmitt et al., 2008).\nIn this article, we focus on the time\u2013averaged axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic flow observed in DT S when the outer sphere rotates. The first observations were described in Nataf et al. (2006), and more thorough results for a\nstatic outer sphere will be discussed in a forthcoming article.\nNataf et al. (2006) showed that the measurement of electric potential differences at the surface of the outer sphere could be related to the azimuthal\nvelocity of the liquid beyond the Hartmann boundary layer. It was found that\nthis velocity could be larger than the solid\u2013body rotation of the inner sphere,\nproviding experimental evidence for the so\u2013called super\u2013rotation predicted\nby Dormy et al. (1998). However, the latitudinal variation of the electric potential differences was found to differ markedly from the one calculated in a\nlinear numerical model, analogous to that of Dormy et al. (1998). The relative variation of electric potential differences with latitude turned out to be\n3\n\n\funiversal, independent of the differential rotation of the inner sphere. This\nwas particularly true when the outer sphere was at rest. The electric design of\nthe electrodes and acquisition system has been improved since, yielding better\nquality signals.\nNumerical models provide a useful guide for interpreting the experimental observations. Linear solutions have been computed by Dormy et al. (1998) for a\nsituation similar to ours (spherical Couette with an imposed dipolar magnetic\nfield, a conducting inner sphere and a rapidly rotating outer sphere). The results show that as the magnetic field is increased, the flow evolves from the\nclassical Stewartson solution (Stewartson, 1966), with a cylindrical shear\u2013layer\nattached to the rotating inner sphere, to a solution where the fluid enclosed\nwithin a closed magnetic field line is entrained by the inner sphere to angular\nvelocities in excess of the imposed differential rotation. A shear\u2013layer develops around that field line (Dormy et al., 2002). Using the numerical approach\ndescribed in Nataf et al. (2006), we have extended these computations to conditions closer to the actual DT S configuration, with stronger global (f ) and\ndifferential (\u2206f ) rotation rates. The results are presented in figure 1. The\nangular velocity contours (figure 1a) clearly illustrate the existence of two domains: a region close to the inner sphere where the magnetic effects dominate,\nand a region where the flow is geostrophic farther away. In the inner region,\nthe angular velocity contours follow the magnetic field lines (Ferraro law of\nisorotation (Ferraro, 1937)), while they are aligned with the rotation axis in\nthe geostrophic region. Dormy et al. (1998) demonstrate that the radial extent\nof the magnetic\u2013dominated region solely depends upon the Elsasser number\n(which compares the Lorentz and Coriolis forces). In contrast to the Stewartson solution, the bulk of the fluid is entrained by the inner sphere, and a\nthin Ekman\u2013Hartmann layer forms beneath the outer shell. Ekman pumping\nresults and feeds the meridional circulation shown in figure 1b. The circulation around the main vortex is counterclockwise in the upper hemisphere (i.e.\ncentrifugal at the equator) when the inner and outer spheres rotate in the\nsame direction, and clockwise (i.e. centripetal at the equator) when the two\nspheres are in contra\u2013rotation. The field lines of the meridional magnetic field\nproduced by this circulation are drawn in figure 1c.\nDirect measurements of the flow velocity were presented in Nataf et al. (2006),\nusing ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry, but only radial profiles of the radial velocity could be obtained. More profiles are now available and can be compared\nwith the numerical simulations. The setup now permits the record of profiles\nof the angular velocity as well, revealing the actual variation of angular velocity inside the sphere. We will see that they confirm the progressive rise of\nthe angular velocity from the equator of the outer sphere to the interior of\nthe fluid predicted by the numerical simulations (figure 1a). The existence of\nthis peculiar boundary layer was predicted by Kleeorin et al. (1997). We will\npresent their approach and propose an extension that provides a better fit to\n4\n\n\four observations.\nThere were some hints in Nataf et al. (2006) that different flows could be\nobserved for the same imposed velocities. With additional data now available,\nthis tendency is fully confirmed. We think that this is due to variations in\nthe electric coupling between the liquid sodium and the copper inner sphere.\nIndeed, the entrainment of the liquid is not viscous but depends on electric\ncurrents that flow between the liquid sodium and the copper shell of the inner\nsphere. The presence of oxides or other impurities, or imperfect wetting on\nthat shell can hinder the electric currents. However, we show in this article\nthat we can use the difference in electric potentials at one latitude (40\u25e6 for\nexample) as a proxy of the actual differential angular velocity of the fluid,\nand get a much more coherent picture of the various observations, if we relate\nthem to this actual value.\nNo measurement of the induced magnetic field was provided by Nataf et al.\n(2006). Here, we present measurements of the radial and orthoradial components of the induced magnetic field at a latitude of about 50\u25e6 just outside the\nouter sphere, in the laboratory frame. The mean values correspond to the field\ninduced by the mean meridional flow. When the outer sphere is rotating, a\nvery peculiar behavior is monitored for a particular counter-rotation rate of\nthe inner sphere.\nWe recall the main features of the DT S setup and measuring techniques in\nsection 2. The typical dimensionless numbers are discussed in section 3. The\nresults are presented in section 4, and discussed in section 5.\n\n2\n\nExperimental setup and measuring techniques\n\n2.1 Setup\nThe central part of the DT S experiment is sketched in figure 2. Forty liters of\nliquid sodium are contained between an inner sphere of radius b = 7.4 cm and\nan outer spherical surface of radius a = 21 cm. The 5 mm\u2013thick outer sphere\nis made of stainless steel, which is 8 times less electrically conductive than\nsodium at 130\u25e6C, the typical experimental temperature. The inner sphere is\nmade of two hollow copper hemispheres filled with 5 layers of magnetized rareearth cobalt bricks. Copper is about 4.2 times more conductive than sodium.\nOutside the copper sphere, the magnetic field is found to be an axial dipole,\naligned with the axis of rotation and pointing downwards with:\n~ \u03b8) = \u03bc0 M (2~er cos \u03b8 + ~e\u03b8 sin \u03b8),\nB(r,\n4\u03c0r 3\n5\n\n\f(b)\n\n(a)\n\n(c)\n\nFig. 1. Non\u2013linear axisymmetric numerical simulation with the geometry and parameters of the DT S setup, corresponding to f = 5 Hz and \u2206f = 0.4 Hz (see section\n3 below) (a) Contour map of the angular velocity. The interval between contours\nis 0.027 in 2\u03c0\u2206f units. Angular velocities are larger than that of the inner sphere\nin the shaded region (super\u2013rotation). Two different regions are clearly visible: the\nregion near the inner sphere, where the flow lines are aligned with the magnetic\nfield lines of the imposed dipole (Ferraro law), and where the angular velocity exceeds that of the inner sphere by up to 6%; farther away, a region where the flow\nis nearly geostrophic, with contours aligned with the rotation axis (vertical). Also\ndrawn, the trajectory of the ultrasonic beam shot from the \"azimuthal\" assembly\nat +10\u25e6 , projected on the meridional plane. Marks are drawn every 2 cm along the\nray path. (b) Meridional circulation. The interval between contours is 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22125\nin 2\u03c0a2 \u2206f units, where a is the radius of the outer sphere. The main circulation\nis counterclockwise, i.e. centrifugal at the equator. It changes sign with \u2206f . Radial\nvelocities are measured along radial shots at latitudes 40\u25e6 and 20\u25e6 (lines). (c) Field\nlines of the induced meridional magnetic field. The interval between contours is\n2 \u00d7 10\u22123 in aB0 units. B0 is the intensity of the imposed dipolar magnetic field at\nthe equator at the outer sphere. The 0 line is thicker. While the imposed dipole is\npointing downwards, the induced field points up at high latitudes. Br and B\u03b8 are\nmeasured at a latitude of 50\u25e6 , 1 cm away from the sodium boundary (arrows).\n\n6\n\n\fin spherical coordinates, with \u03b8 the colatitude and M = \u2212700 Am2 the magnetic dipolar moment, yielding a magnetic field amplitude ranging from 0.345\nT at the poles of the inner sphere down to 0.008 T at the equator of the outer\nsphere. More details are given in Nataf et al. (2006).\nThe inner and outer spheres are set in rotation around the vertical axis. In\nthis article, we present results obtained for imposed rotation rates f of the\nouter sphere of 5, 10 and 15 Hz. The rotation rate of the inner sphere in\nthe laboratory frame is varied between -25 and +25 Hz, yielding differential\nrotation rates \u2206f of the inner sphere in the rotating frame ranging from -40\nto 20 Hz (depending upon f ). Each sphere is entrained by an 11 kW brushless\nelectric motor (Yaskawa SGMGH-1ADCA61).\nThe torques and actual rotation rates are retrieved as analog signals from the\ntwo motor controllers. In order to decipher the organisation of the flow in the\nliquid, several techniques are employed. Electric potentials are measured at\nseveral locations on the outer sphere. Profiles of the flow velocity are obtained\nusing ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry. Since the outer sphere is rotating, all\nthese signals must pass through electric slip-rings to be analyzed in the laboratory frame. We use a 36\u2013tracks 10A slip\u2013ring system (Litton AC6275\u201312).\nIn order to decrease electromagnetic perturbations of the signals, this system is completely enclosed in an aluminum casing. In contrast, the magnetic\nfield is measured in the laboratory frame, with magnetometer sensors a few\nmillimeters away from the rotating surface of the outer sphere.\n\n2.2 Electric potentials\n\nWe measure the electric potential at several points on the outer sphere. Blind\nholes are drilled in the 5 mm\u2013thick stainless steel shell. The holes are 1 mm in\ndiameter, and 4 mm\u2013deep. They are threaded and equipped with 3 mm\u2013long\nM1.2 mm brass bolts, on the head of which electrodes are soldered. Stainless\nsteel is a poor electric conductor as compared to liquid sodium and thus it\ndoes not affect the dynamically generated electric potential, but it is a good\nenough electric conductor for the impedance of electrode pairs to be much\nsmaller than that of the acquisition system. The measurements are acquired\nat 1 kHz with a PXI-6229 National Instruments board, after going through a\nsimple anti\u2013aliasing 215 Hz low\u2013pass RC filter. As we focus here on the mean\naxisymmetric state, these data are time\u2013averaged over time\u2013windows ranging\nfrom 0.1 to 1 second, in order to remove fluctuations.\nIn this article, we present data for the difference in electric potential measured\nbetween electrodes placed along the same meridian. These electrodes are 10\u25e6\napart and range from \u221245\u25e6 to +45\u25e6 in latitude as shown in figure 2. Assuming\n7\n\n\fFig. 2. Sketch of the central part of the DT S experiment. The 7.4 cm-radius inner\nsphere is made of copper and contains 5 layers of magnets. The inner radius of\nthe stainless steel outer sphere is 21 cm and its thickness is 5 mm. Blind holes are\ndrilled and threaded along several meridians and parallels to receive M1.2 mm brass\nbolts acting as electrodes. In this article, results are presented for electric potentials\nmeasured along one meridian (on the left). The large holes at latitudes \u221220\u25e6 , 10\u25e6\nand \u00b140\u25e6 receive interchangeable assemblies, which can be equipped with ultrasonic\ntransducers. Magnetometers are placed at a latitude of 50\u25e6 , just above the outer\nsphere, in the laboratory frame. They measure the radial Br and orthoradial B\u03b8\ncomponents of the magnetic field.\n\nsteady state, the difference in electric potential \u2206V between two electrodes\nseparated by a latitudinal angle \u2206\u03b8 is related to the azimuthal velocity U\u03c6 of\nthe liquid sodium by:\nj\u03b8\n\u2206V\n= U\u03c6 Br \u2212 ,\n(1)\na\u2206\u03b8\n\u03c3\nwhere Br is the radial component of the magnetic field, j\u03b8 is the \u03b8-component\nof the electric current, and \u03c3 is the electric conductivity of liquid sodium.\nIn Nataf et al. (2006), we used the differences in electric potential to deduce\nthe angular velocity of the liquid sodium flow beneath the Hartmann boundary\nlayer. Indeed, assuming that the meridional electric currents vanish below that\nlayer, equation 1 yields:\n\nU\u03c6 =\n\n\u2206V\n\u2206V\nor \u2206ffluid (s) =\n,\na\u2206\u03b8 Br\n2\u03c0s a\u2206\u03b8 Br\n8\n\n(2)\n\n\fwhere \u2206ffluid (s) is the angular frequency of the fluid with respect to the outer\nsphere at the cylindrical radius s for the latitude of the electrode pair. In this\narticle, we will use the difference in electric potential measured at 40\u25e6 latitude\n(\u2206V40\u25e6 ) as a proxy of the actual rotation frequency of the liquid sodium flow\nwith respect to the outer sphere.\n\n2.3 Ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry\nSince liquid sodium is opaque, it is not possible to use optical methods to investigate the flow within the sphere. Instead, we use ultrasounds to probe the flow.\nUltrasonic transducers (TR0405HS from Signal Processing, Switzerland) are\nplaced in removable assemblies on the outer sphere, and shoot a narrow beam\nof 4 MHz ultrasounds. The pulsed Doppler velocimetry technique is perfectly\nsuited for retrieving profiles of the component of the flow velocity along the\nshooting line, as illustrated in Brito et al. (2001), Eckert and Gerbeth (2002),\nand Nataf et al. (2006). We use a DOP 2000 instrument from Signal Processing, Switzerland.\nWhile only radial profiles of the radial velocity were discussed in Nataf et al.\n(2006), we show here profiles of both the radial and angular velocities. Radial\nprofiles are measured at two different latitudes (\u221220\u25e6 and \u221240\u25e6 ), as drawn\nin figure 1b. The angular velocities are obtained with an assembly devised\nfor shooting a beam at an angle of 24\u25e6 away from radial. Radial velocities\nare found to be at least one order of magnitude smaller than the azimuthal\nvelocities. Neglecting the radial velocity component, the axisymmetric angular\nfrequency \u2206ffluid (s, z) of the fluid flow can thus be retrieved by projection of\nthe velocity U(d) measured along the shooting line. With our actual geometry,\none gets:\n\n\u2206ffluid (s, z) =\n\n2.88 U(d)\n,\n2\u03c0 a\n\n(3)\n\nwhere d is the distance along the shooting line, s the cylindrical radius, and z\nthe height above the equatorial plane, which are related by:\nz(d) = a sin 10\u25e6 \u2212 0.359 d\ns(d) = a\n\n(4)\n\nv\nu\nu\nd\n\u25e6t\ncos 10 1 \u2212 1.76\n\na\n\n+ 0.898\n\nd\na\n\n!2\n\n(5)\n\nAs shown in figure 1a, plotting z versus s for this beam yields the projection\nof the ray path in a meridional plane. Tick marks have been drawn every 2\n9\n\n\fcm along the path. The minimum cylindrical radius reached is s = 7.7 cm,\nclose to the radius of the inner sphere (7.4 cm), but it is attained some 4 cm\nbeneath the equator.\nThe Doppler technique relies upon ultrasonic energy backscattered by particles\nin the liquid. We did not add any particle in the liquid sodium. In liquid metals,\nit is often assumed that the backscattered echoes are due to floating oxides.\nIt is interesting to note that we were able to record good profiles, even when\nthe outer sphere was rotating at 14 Hz, implying centrifugal acceleration up\nto 180 times the acceleration due to gravity.\n\n2.4 Induced magnetic field\n\nThe magnetic field is measured outside the sphere, in the laboratory frame.\nBoth the radial Br and the orthoradial B\u03b8 components are measured with a\n\"Giant MagnetoResistance\" (GMR) chip. The two chips are mounted on a\ncircuit protected by a stainless steel tube. The probe has been installed at\na latitude of 50\u25e6 , as close as possible to the rotating sphere: the distance to\nthe center of the sphere is about 22 cm. The variation of temperature has a\nsignificant effect on the measurements. Temperature is thus measured close\nto the GMR magnetometers, and a linear correction scheme is applied. The\nacquisition rate is 2000 samples per second, but all data presented here have\nbeen moving\u2013averaged over 3 seconds, since we are focusing on the time\u2013\naveraged axisymmetric mean flow.\n\n3\n\nDimensionless numbers\n\nRelevant parameters and dimensionless numbers are given in table 1. The\nsymbols have their usual meaning : \u03b7 is the magnetic diffusivity, \u03c1 the density,\n\u03bd the kinematic viscosity of the liquid sodium. As in all moderate\u2013size liquid\nsodium experiments, the Joule dissipation time \u03c4J is relatively short. Since the\nimposed magnetic field is dipolar, its amplitude is much larger near the inner\nsphere (B = Bi ) than near the outer sphere (B = Bo ). We therefore evaluate\nthose numbers that depend on the strength of the magnetic field in these\ntwo regions. The Hartmann number Ha is large everywhere. The Lundquist\nnumber S is large near the inner sphere, implying that Alfv\u00e9n waves can play\na role in the dynamics, with typical velocities Ua ranging from 0.2 to 5 m/s,\nin the same range as flow velocities.\nValues of the Ekman number E are given for two typical values of the rotation rate f of the outer sphere. The DT S experiment has been designed for\n10\n\n\fthe study of the magnetostrophic regime, in which Lorentz forces and Coriolis\nforces are of similar amplitude. This is measured by the Elsasser number \u039b,\nwhich ranges from 0.01 near the outer sphere (where Coriolis forces dominate) to nearly 10 near the inner sphere (where Lorentz forces dominate). For\ntime\u2013scales short compared to the magnetic diffusion time, a measure of the\nrelative influence of the rotational and magnetic effects is given by the dimensionless number \u03bb, the ratio of the Alfv\u00e9n velocity to the inertial wave velocity\n(Fearn et al., 1988; Cardin et al., 2002), which is called the Lehnert number\n(Lehnert, 1954) by Jault (2008). The Lehnert number is small in planetary\ncores, and rotational effects are expected to dominate at short time\u2013scales. In\nthe DT S experiment, the Lehnert number is less than 1.\nWe estimate a typical velocity U from the magnitude of the differential rotation \u2206f of the inner sphere with respect to the outer sphere. The estimate is\nbased on the tangential velocity at the equator of the inner sphere. We will\nsee that, because the magnetic coupling between the magnetized inner sphere\nand the liquid sodium is strong, velocities in the fluid layer typically reach this\nvalue. This yields magnetic Reynolds numbers Rm in excess of 40, while the\nReynolds number Re lies in the range 105 \u2212 106 . The interaction parameter N\nranges from 0.01 near the outer sphere to 250 near the inner sphere, meaning\nthat inertial effects only play a role near the outer boundary. Note that the\nRossby number Ro is here simply defined as Ro = \u2206\u03a9/\u03a9 = \u2206f /f .\nThe DT S experiment thus enables us to explore an original parameter range,\nwhich covers some aspects of liquid core dynamics.\n\n4\n\nResults\n\n4.1 A typical run\n\nFigure 3 illustrates the data typically acquired during a 1600s-long run. The\ntop graph shows the variation of f , the rotation frequency of the outer sphere,\nand \u2206f , that of the inner sphere with respect to the outer sphere. The outer\nsphere is first set to a rotation rate of about 5 Hz, then several plateaux\nof different \u2206f are produced, down to \u2206f = -21.5 Hz. Here, they all correspond to counter\u2013rotation. Some small fluctuations of the rotation rates are\nobserved (\u00b13% max for \u2206f and \u00b17% max for f ). They are due to variations\nin the power demanded to the motors, as shown in the next graph below,\nwhich displays the total power of the motors, reaching 2.3 kW. Note the large\npower fluctuations (\u00b122%) in the middle of the plateau with \u2206f = -19 Hz.\nThe next graph gives the differences in electric potential \u2206V recorded by the\neight electrode pairs along a meridian. The highest signal reaches 3 mV. As\n11\n\n\fFig. 3. An example of the data acquisition during an experimental run, as a function\nof time (in seconds). The top graph shows f , the rotation rate of the outer sphere,\nand \u2206f , the rotation rate of the inner sphere with respect to the outer sphere. The\nnext graph below is the total power. The differences in electric potential recorded\nby the eight longitudinal electrode pairs (from \u221240\u25e6 to 40\u25e6 latitude) is shown next.\nThe last graph below gives the Br and B\u03b8 components of the induced magnetic field\n(in mT) recorded on the 50\u25e6 -latitude magnetometer, corrected for temperature.

For the numbers that depend on the\nmagnetic field strength, two values are given, the first one with B = Bi = 0.175 T\nat the equator of the inner sphere, the second one with B = Bo = 0.008 T at the\nequator of the outer sphere.\n\nexpected from equation 2, the potential difference is largest at the highest latitude because Br is largest there. Since \u2206f is negative, the electric potential\ndifferences are positive in the southern hemisphere and negative in the northern hemisphere (with our connection conventions). There is an almost perfect\nsymmetry between the two hemispheres. Several ultrasonic Doppler velocity\nprofiles are recorded during this sequence. The last graph below shows the\ninduced magnetic field measured at 50\u25e6 latitude. The records have been timeaveraged along a 3 seconds\u2013window to remove the fluctuations linked with the\nrotation of the outer sphere, and the imposed dipole contribution has been re13\n\n\fFig. 4. An example of an ultrasonic Doppler angular velocity acquisition.

The shades give the velocity value in m/s (scale on the right-hand side).\nStrong velocity fluctuations are observed.\n\nmoved. The plateaux are well identified, but large fluctuations are observed\nwhen \u2206f is large. The maximum amplitude of the induced magnetic field is\n0.23 mT (2.4% of the imposed field at this position).\nA typical ultrasonic Doppler velocity record is shown in figure 4. It corresponds\nto the time window marked with a horizontal bar in the last graph of figure\n3, when time\u2013oscillations are observed on all data. The spatiotemporal plot\nclearly shows these oscillations. The velocities are largest at the bottom of\nthe figure, where the ultrasonic beam gets closest to the inner sphere for this\nrecord. Equation 5 gives the value of the cylindrical radius s = 12.1 cm. There,\nthe velocity reaches -3.5 m/s. This large value is nevertheless smaller than the\nimposed tangential velocity on the inner sphere (-8.7 m/s). For this file, the\ntime\u2013interval between profiles is 15 ms, and there are 128 shots per profile.\nVelocities cannot be measured in the first 1 cm of the records, due to strong\nreverberations in the assembly wall.\nNote that all data display large fluctuations in the time\u2013window between 1100\nand 1250 seconds. We will see that, in this parameter range, the flow exhibits a\nfundamental transition between two different configurations (see section 5.4).\nHere, this transition is preceded by large oscillations, while in some other runs,\nit occurs in one single step.\n14\n\n\f\u2206 f*\n\nfluid\n\nfrom \u2206V\n\n40\u00b0\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221210\n0\n\u2206 f (Hz)\n\n10\n\n20\n\nFig. 5.

Note that very different angular\nvelocities are measured for a given \u2206f .\n\n4.2 Evolution with the imposed differential rotation\n\n\u2217\nFigure 5 shows the dimensionless angular frequencies \u2206ffluid\n= U\u03c6 /2\u03c0s\u2206f\n\u25e6\ndeduced from the electric potential differences measured at 40 latitude (according to equation 2), as a function of the imposed differential rotation \u2206f ,\nfor a given rotation rate f \u2243 4.5 Hz of the outer sphere. The figure is similar\nto figure 4 of Nataf et al. (2006), but data from several additional runs are\nincluded. The data points appear very scattered: for a given \u2206f , the dimensionless angular velocity can vary by up to a factor of 3. We think that this is\ndue to variations in the electric coupling between liquid sodium and the inner\ncopper sphere. The coupling between the rotating inner sphere and the liquid\nsodium depends on the electric currents that are induced in the sodium and\nloop in the copper inner sphere. A similar scatter is observed when plotting\nthe induced magnetic field as a function of \u2206f (figure 6).\n\nThis scatter makes it difficult to draw robust conclusions about features such\nas super\u2013rotation, but we will show in the next section that there is a linear\nrelationship between the electric potential difference at 40\u25e6 (\u2206V40\u25e6 ) and the\nazimuthal velocities in the sodium actually measured with ultrasonic Doppler\nvelocimetry. We will therefore use \u2206V40\u25e6 as a proxy of the actual flow velocity,\nand we will see that several features of the flow become coherent when this\n15\n\n\fFig. 6.

Velocity (in m/s) at a distance of 8.5 cm along the shot line (s \u2243 13.6cm),\nas a function of \u2206f (left) and \u2206V40\u25e6 (right). The rotation rate of the outer sphere\nis f \u2243 4.5 Hz. The linear relation we get on the right shows that \u2206V40\u25e6 is a good\nproxy of the angular velocity of the fluid at depth.\n\nthe measured velocity component is proportional to the angular velocity of\nthe fluid. Actually, the plot is built from a 40 s\u2013long record and the shades\nmap the probability density function (pdf ) of velocity versus distance. In this\nregime, the flow is almost steady and the pdf is sharp. Velocity rises steadily\nfrom a value close to 0.3 m/s at the outer boundary (top of the graph) to reach\na plateau of about 0.85 m/s. The velocity further increases to a bump at 1.05\nm/s where the ultrasonic beam gets closest to the inner sphere (d \u2243 18.8 cm,\ns \u2243 7.9 cm). We interpret this bump as the signature of the magnetic wind,\nwhich is confined to the neighborhood of the inner sphere, where the magnetic\nfield is largest. The plateau characterizes the region where the fluid is entrained\nat an almost uniform angular velocity. This profile is typical of those measured\nwhen the outer sphere is rotating, and differs from those obtained when the\nouter sphere is at rest. For all available profiles, we pick the velocity measured\nat a distance of 8.5 cm (on the plateau, and about at mid\u2013depth of the fluid\nlayer, in the equatorial plane, according to figure 1) and plot it as a function\nof the corresponding \u2206f and \u2206V40\u25e6 (Figure 8). While the former plot displays\na large scatter, all points align well when velocity is plotted against \u2206V40\u25e6 ,\nillustrating the idea that the latter represents a good proxy of the effective\nvelocity. From the regression line, we can translate \u2206V40\u25e6 into fluid velocity\nor fluid flow frequency at depth in the fluid. We obtain: \u2206ffluid /\u2206V40\u25e6 \u2243 2600\nHz/V. Note that the fluid velocity deduced from \u2206V40\u25e6 using equation 2 agrees\nwith the azimuthal velocity measured by ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry at the\ncylindrical radius corresponding to this latitude of 40\u25e6 .\nIn figure 9, we have plotted all the profiles for f \u2243 4.5 Hz and positive \u2206f , divided by the corresponding \u2206V40\u25e6 . The horizontal scale has been chosen to pro17\n\n\fvide the actual adimensional angular velocity for the reference case \u2206f = 3.2\nHz, according to equation 3. However, one should not consider this scale as\nuniversal, since the actual coupling is very variable (see figure 5). We have also\ndrawn a synthetic profile derived from a numerical simulation similar to the\none shown in figure 1 with \u2206f = 0.4 Hz, but with the electric conductivity of\nthe inner sphere reduced from its nominal value of 4.2 times that of the liquid\nsodium down to 0.04. In a first approximation, all experimental profiles collapse on a single curve, showing that the normalization with \u2206V40\u25e6 is adequate.\nA closer look reveals that the rise of the velocity from the outer boundary is\nsharper when the forcing is weaker. In other words, the plateau of high angular velocity extends further towards the outer sphere for weak forcing. We will\npresent in section 5.2 a simple model, in the spirit of Kleeorin et al. (1997),\nthat reproduces these characteristics (dotted and dashed lines). It seems that\nthe relative size of the bump due to the magnetic wind above the plateau does\nnot depend much upon the forcing. The comparison with the numerical profile\nsuggests that the zone of strong magnetic wind is closer to the inner sphere\nin the experiments than in the simulation. We also note that the profile that\ncorresponds to the highest differential rotation rate \u2206f = 18.7 Hz plots below\nthe others and has a distinct kink near the outer boundary, which makes it\nlook more alike the profiles obtained with f = 0.\n\n4.4 Electric potentials\n\nWe showed in Nataf et al. (2006) that, when the outer sphere is at rest, the\nrelative variation of electric potential differences (normalized to its value at\n40\u25e6 ) with latitude is independent of the differential rotation rate \u2206f . The\nbetter data now available confirm this observation and further demonstrate\nthat the latitudinal variation of potentials is close to, but significantly different\nfrom, the one expected for solid body rotation. Figure 10 gives the variation of\nelectric potential differences \u2206V at latitudes of 10\u25e6 , 20\u25e6 and 30\u25e6 as a function\nof \u2206V40\u25e6 , for three different rotation rates of the outer sphere (f \u2243 4.5, 9 and\n13.5 Hz), and several different \u2206f (both positive and negative). The case with\nno rotation (f = 0) is included for reference. In all four cases, the data points\nalign well, and fall not far from (but distinctly off) the straight lines calculated\nfor solid body rotation (i.e., assuming U\u03c6 proportional to s in equation 2). In\nfact, we deduce from the measured trend for f = 4.5 Hz that the angular\nvelocity at 30\u25e6 is about 0.9 times that at 40\u25e6 , in good agreement with the\nangular velocity profiles of figure 9. At lower latitudes, the apparent velocities\ndeduced from the electric potentials are larger than the actual velocities, as the\nassumptions used in equation 2 break down (Nataf et al., 2006). In contrast\nwith this simple linear trend, there is a distinct interval of \u2206V40\u25e6 that displays a\npeculiar behavior, when the outer sphere is rotating. It occurs around \u2206V40\u25e6 =\n\u22121.7 mV for f = 4.5 Hz, -3.3 mV for f = 9 Hz, and -4.4 mV for f = 13.5 Hz.\n18\n\n\fDistance along \"azimuthal\" beam (cm)\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n0\n\n3.2 Hz\n4.8\n6.4\n8.0\n11.2\n12.7\n15.9\n18.7\n0.4 Hz\n0.5 Hz laminar\n15 Hz turbulent\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nAdimensional angular velocity\nFig. 9.

The horizontal scale\nhas been chosen to give the actual adimensional angular velocity for the reference\nprofile with \u2206f = 3.2 Hz. The continuous lines are predictions of different sort: the\nsolid line is the profile obtained from the numerical model of figure 1, (\u2206f = 0.4\nHz) with the electrical conductivity of the inner sphere reduced by a factor 100\n(see section 5.3). The almost superposed dotted line is derived from the analysis\nof Kleeorin et al. (1997), and the dashed line is the prediction of our extended\ntorque\u2013balance model for \u2206f = 15 Hz (see section 5.2). The two latter models only\npredict the shape of the boundary\u2013layer profile, not the height of the plateau of\nnear solid\u2013body rotation.\n\nThe kink means that, there, the variations in electric potentials are larger at\nlow latitudes than at 40\u25e6 . We will see below that the induced magnetic field\nalso displays a very peculiar variation around the same values of \u2206V40\u25e6 .\n\n4.5 Induced magnetic field\n\nThe induced magnetic field is measured outside the sphere, in the laboratory frame. The mean axisymmetric part of the induced field results from the\ninteraction of the imposed axial dipolar magnetic field with the mean axisymmetric part of the meridional velocity field. The magnetometer signals are\nfirst averaged over 3 seconds, in order to remove the oscillatory part (which\nis discussed in another article (Schmitt et al., 2008)) and other magnetic per19\n\n\fFig. 10. A composite of electric potential differences for four different rotation rates\nf of the outer sphere. The electric potential difference measured at latitudes of\n10\u25e6 , 20\u25e6 , and 30\u25e6 are plotted against that measured at 40\u25e6 . The relation is almost\nlinear, except for a kink observed around a negative value of \u2206V40\u25e6 , which moves\ntowards more negative values when f increases. The dashed straight lines indicate\nthe relationship one would get if the fluid was in solid body rotation. Scattered\npoints in the bottom panels are due to electromagnetic noise.\n\n20\n\n\fturbations. We then correct for temperature drift, by removing an empirical\nlinear correction. In figure 11, both the radial Br and orthoradial B\u03b8 components are plotted as a function of \u2206V40\u25e6 for several different imposed rotation\nfrequencies f of the outer sphere. We have included the f = 0 case for reference.\nThe first thing to note is the change of symmetry about \u2206V40\u25e6 = 0 for small\nforcing : while the induced magnetic field is always positive when the outer\nsphere is at rest, we find that the induced field has the sign of \u2206V40\u25e6 (or \u2206f )\nwhen the outer sphere is rotating. This can be directly related to the sense of\nthe meridional circulation. When the outer sphere is at rest, the flow is always\ncentrifugal in the equatorial plane, irrespective of the sign of \u2206f . When the\nouter sphere is rotating, the sense of the mass flux through the outer viscous\nboundary layer is governed by the sign of the differential rotation between the\nfluid and the outer sphere (as for Ekman pumping). When \u2206f /f is negative\nand small enough, the mass flux out of the boundary layer is thus centripetal\nat the equator.\nIn that same regime, we also note that the induced magnetic field is weaker\nwhen the outer sphere is rotating : the meridional circulation violates the\nProudman\u2013Taylor constraint and therefore decreases as the Ekman number\ndecreases (see figure 6 of Hollerbach et al. (2007)).\nHowever, the most interesting feature of the curves shown in figure 11 is the\ndistinctive narrow peak observed at negative \u2206f (here negative \u2206V40\u25e6 ). The\npeak occurs for a value of \u2206V40\u25e6 that moves toward more negative values as\nf increases. In fact, the occurrence of the peak corresponds to the transition\nbetween two different regimes, which was invoked when discussing figure 10.\nWe stress that it is because we plot the induced magnetic field as a function\nof \u2206V40\u25e6 rather than \u2206f that we obtain a well defined and reproducible peak\n(compare with figure 6). The peak happens as the flow evolves from centripetal\nto centrifugal in the equatorial plane, as the effect of differential rotation takes\nover the effect of global rotation.\n\n4.6 Radial velocity profiles\n\nWhile the induced magnetic field measured outside the sphere is a good indicator of the global symmetries of the meridional flow, it cannot be used to\ninvestigate the internal organization of that flow. Here, we add the information\nbrought by radial profiles of the radial velocity obtained by ultrasonic Doppler\nvelocimetry. A compilation of the profiles obtained for three different rotation\nfrequencies f of the outer sphere is given in figure 12 for two different latitudes:\n\u221220\u25e6 (figure 12a) and \u221240\u25e6 (figure 12b). The profiles clearly confirm that the\n21\n\n\fFig. 11. A composite of the induced magnetic field as a function of \u2206V40\u25e6 , for four\ndifferent rotation frequencies f of the outer sphere. Radial component on the left,\nand orthoradial component on the right. Note the symmetry change around the\norigin (\u2206f \u2243 0) between the case without rotation (f = 0) and the other cases. A\nstriking peak is observed for a particular value of \u2206f in the counterrotating regime\n(\u2206V40\u25e6 < 0). The colors correspond to different runs.\n\nsign of the radial velocity changes with the sign of \u2206f , as inferred from the\ninduced magnetic field measurements. At \u221240\u25e6 , the profiles are characterized\nby a broad peak with radial velocity rising from zero at the inner sphere to a\nmaximum, which can reach about 3% of the tangential velocity of the inner\nsphere. There, the flow is centripetal when the Rossby number is positive. The\nradial velocity falls back to zero at nearly the same radius for all f , but the\nprofiles for the higher f (lower Ekman number) are characterized by a strong\nsecond peak. At \u221220\u25e6 , the amplitudes are similar but seem to increase with\nf . The change of sign as \u2206f changes sign is well visible again.\n22\n\n\f1\n(4.5 , 3)\n(9 , \u22123)\n(9 , 3)\n(14 , 6)\n\n0.8\n\nadimensional radius\n\nadimensional radius\n\n1\n\n0.6\n\n(4.5 , 3)\n(9 , \u22126)\n(9 , 6)\n(14 , \u22126)\n(14 , 6)\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4 (a)\n\n0.4 (b)\n\n\u22120.04\n\u22120.02\n0\n0.02\n0.04\nadimensional radial velocity at \u221220\u00b0\n\n\u22120.04\n\n\u22120.02\n0\n0.02\n0.04\nadimensional radial velocity at \u221240\u00b0\n\nFig. 12.

The dotted line indicates the radius of the tangent cylinder on the inner sphere,\nwhose adimensional radius is 0.35 (bottom of the plots). All velocities are normalized\nwith the differential tangential velocity at the equator of the inner sphere. The\nprofiles are labelled by their (f , \u2206f ) pair. Note that the sign of the radial velocity\nchanges as the sign of \u2206f , as expected for Ekman\u2013pumping dominated flow.\n\n5\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\n\n5.1 Moderate\u2013Rossby number regime\n\nThe magnetostrophic regime at moderate Rossby numbers is characterized by\na low level of turbulence. Most of the energy is in the axisymmetric mean\nflow described in this article. The meridional circulation has the symmetry\nof Ekman pumping: counterclockwise in a meridional plane (i.e., centrifugal\nat the equator) for Ro > 0 and clockwise for Ro < 0. Radial velocities are\nat least one order of magnitude smaller than azimuthal velocities. Waves are\nobserved in this regime, and are described in another article (Schmitt et al.,\n2008).\nProfiles of the angular velocity of the flow have been obtained, using ultrasonic\nDoppler velocimetry. They reveal a region where magnetic wind is present,\nnear the inner sphere, where the magnetic field is largest. Farther away, the\nflow is geostrophic, under the effect of the Coriolis force. A large part of the\ngeostrophic region is entrained by the magnetic wind at a nearly constant\nangular velocity.\n23\n\n\fThe measurements show that the shape of the angular velocity profile is nearly\nindependent of Ro as long as it remains moderate. This suggests that, in contrast to the case with a fixed outer sphere (Nataf et al., 2006; Hollerbach et al.,\n2007), the linear solution (Ro << 1) provides a good description of the flow.\nWe were able to compute solutions in the linear regime with the geometry\nand parameters of the DT S experiment for f = 5 Hz (E = 4.7 10\u22127), as\nshown in figure 1. In figure 1a, one clearly sees a non\u2013geostrophic inner region\nwhere the Ferraro law of isorotation applies, a central part where the flow is\ngeostrophic and in almost solid\u2013body rotation, and an outer domain, which is\nalso geostrophic but in which the angular velocity decreases rapidly towards\nthe outer sphere. In order to compare with the experimental results, synthetic\nvelocity profiles have been computed. The comparison of the angular velocity\nprofiles is shown in figure 9. All profiles show the plateau of nearly constant\nangular velocity, the central peak due to the magnetic wind, and the gentle\ndrop to lower velocity towards the outer sphere. We note however that this velocity drop is much steeper in the numerical simulation (which has Ro = 0.08).\nSeveral of these features had been predicted by Kleeorin et al. (1997) in an\nasymptotic study of spherical Couette flow in a dipolar magnetic field. We\nrecall their main results below and propose an extension of their approach,\nwhich better explains our experimental results.\n\n5.2 Modified Taylor constraint and extended quasi\u2013geostrophic model for the\nmoderate\u2013Rossby number flow\n\nThe quasi\u2013geostrophic regime with an imposed magnetic field has been studied extensively by Kleeorin et al. (1997). Following the pionneer computations\nof Hollerbach (1994) of rotating spherical Couette in a dipolar magnetic field,\nthey worked out the asymptotic solutions for small Elsasser, Ekman, Reynolds\nand Rossby numbers. They predicted the existence of a geostrophic region\nwhere the magnetic torque on coaxial cylindrical tubes balances weak friction in the upper and lower Ekman layers, thus providing an extension of the\nzero\u2013Ekman number analysis of Taylor (1963), which results in the so\u2013called\nTaylor\u2013state. We consider the torques at work on a cylindrical tube at cylindrical radius from s to s + ds. Neglecting the volumetric viscous friction (small\nEkman number), the torque balance can be written as:\n\nd\u03b3T (s) + d\u03b3B (s) + d\u0393M (s) = 0,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere d\u03b3T and d\u03b3B are the (resistive) torques on the top and bottom spherical\ncaps at the outer sphere, and d\u0393M is the volumetric (driving) torque exerted\nby the Lorentz force (magnetic torque). In our case, the surface torques are\ndue to Ekman friction on the outer sphere and can be written:\n24\n\n\fd\u03b3T (s) = d\u03b3B (s) = 2\u03c0s2 \u03c4V\n\nds\n,\ncos \u03b8\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the colatitude and \u03c4V is the azimuthal component of the friction\nstress on the outer shell.\nAt high latitudes, friction in the Ekman layers is weak and, as in the Taylor\nstate, the balancing magnetic torque vanishes in the steady\u2013state and the fluid\nis in solid body rotation. The magnetic torque can be expressed as:\n\n2\n\nd\u0393M (s) = 2\u03c0s ds\n\nZ\n\nzT\n\nzB\n\n~ \u03c6 dz = 2\u03c0 ds d s2\n(~j \u00d7 B)\n\u03bc0 ds\n\u0014\n\nZ\n\nzT\n\nzB\n\n\u0015\n\nBs b\u03c6 dz ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere Bs is the component of the imposed magnetic field along the cylindrical radius s, while b\u03c6 is the (unknown) azimuthal component of the induced\nmagnetic field. This component results from the shearing of the dipolar field\nlines by deviations of the fluid flow from solid body rotation. A weak magnetic torque thus implies a small deviation from solid body rotation, especially\nwhere the imposed field Bs is large, i.e. near the inner sphere (but not too close,\nbecause the flow is no longer geostrophic there). As noted by Kleeorin et al.\n(1997), this explains why the angular velocity of the fluid \u2206\u03c9(s) is almost\nconstant in the central part of the spherical shell. The progressive decrease\nof the angular velocity as s increases further was predicted by Kleeorin et al.\n(1997). In this layer, which they call \"magnetic\u2013Proudman\", shear in the upper and lower Ekman layers increases, so as to produce a large enough b\u03c6 to\ncompensate for the decrease of Bs in the expression of the magnetic torque.\nIn order to be more quantitative, one needs to express b\u03c6 (s, z) as a function\nof \u2206\u03c9(s). Kleeorin et al. (1997) show that, when the imposed magnetic field\nis a dipole, the magnetic torque can be written:\n12\u03c0 2 5\ns\nds\nd\u0393M (s) =\n2 1\u2212\nB0 a \u2206\u03a9\n\u03bc0 \u03b7\na\na\n\u0014 \u0012\n\n\u0013\u00153/2\n\n\u2206\u03c9 \u2020 \u2212 \u2206\u03c9(s)\n,\n\u2206\u03a9\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u2206\u03c9 \u2020 is the differential rotation of the fluid in the region of nearly solid\u2013\nbody rotation. The friction stress for the laminar Ekman layer is easily calculated and yields:\n\u221a\nds s3\ns2\n1\n\u2212\nd\u03b3T (s) = \u22122\u03c0\u03c1a4 \u2206\u03a9 \u03bd\u03a9\na a3\na2\n\"\n\n#\u22121/4\n\n\u2206\u03c9(s)\n.\n\u2206\u03a9\n\n(10)\n\nInjecting expressions 9 and 10 in equation 6 in the boundary layer approximation (s \u2243 a), Kleeorin et al. (1997) obtain the shape of the profile of the\nangular velocity versus s:\n25\n\n\f\u2206\u03c9 \u2020\n\n\u2206\u03c9(s) =\n1+\n\n\u221a\n\u03c1 \u03bd\u03a9\n3a\u03c3B02\n\nh \u0010\n\n2 1\u2212\n\ns\na\n\n\u0011i\u22127/4\n\n(11)\n\nThe synthetic angular velocity profile derived from this expression is the dotted line of figure 9. The value of \u2206\u03c9 \u2020 has been chosen to coincide with the\nfull numerical profile drawn (solid line). Indeed, Kleeorin et al. (1997) studied\nthe case when the flow remains geostrophic all the way to the inner sphere,\nwhere they matched the solid\u2013body solution to the Stewartson layer modified\nby the magnetic field. They could thus predict the value of \u2206\u03c9 \u2020 . In our case,\nthe inner region is not geostrophic, and we only use their analysis to probe\nthe shape of the angular velocity profiles in the geostrophic region. It is clear\nthat, in that region, the asymptotic prediction of Kleeorin et al. (1997) is a\nvery good approximation of the actual numerical profile. However, we note\nthat both profiles fail to explain the much more gentle rise of angular velocity\nobserved in the experiments. The explanation is that the Ekman boundary\nlayer becomes turbulent at the high \u2206f reached in our experiments. We can\nretain the approach of Kleeorin et al. (1997) and simply allow for turbulent\nfriction stress \u03c4V in equation 7. Because of turbulence, Ekman friction is enhanced and a stronger magnetic torque is needed to balance it. This results\nin a widening of the \"Proudman\u2013magnetic\" layer, as shown by the dashed\nline in figure 9, computed for \u2206f = 15 Hz. The widening increases as \u2206f\nincreases, in excellent agreement with our measurements. The full ingredients\nand implications of this extended model will be given elsewhere.\n5.3 Variable electric coupling and Roef f\nIn Nataf et al. (2006), there were hints that different flows could be obtained\nfor the same imposed rotation rates f and \u2206f . Our new data confirm this\ntrend. We speculate that this behavior is due to variations in the electric coupling between liquid sodium and the copper inner sphere, under the effect of\nelectrowetting feedback. It is thus difficult to relate the observed signals to\nthe imposed \u2206f , as we would like to do in order to study the possibility for\nthe magnetic wind to induce super\u2013rotation of the fluid as in Dormy et al.\n(1998). However, we find that most results can be cast in a coherent frame if\nwe use \u2206V40\u25e6 , the electric potential difference at latitude 40\u25e6 , as a proxy of\nthe actual angular velocity, in place of \u2206f , resulting in an effective Rossby\nnumber Roef f . In order to mimic a weaker electric coupling, numerical simulations have been run where the electric conductivity of the inner sphere is\nreduced as compared to that of copper (nominal conductivity ratio of 4.2).\nSynthetic angular velocity profiles are shown in figure 13a for a conductivity\nratio of 0.04 and 0.01. The profiles retain the same shape but the overall amplitude is severely reduced. This explains why we could get coherent results by\n26\n\n\f1\n\n0\n\n(b)\n\n0.5\n\n0.8\n\n0.01\n\n1\n\n0.04\n\nradius\n\ndistance along \"azimuthal\" beam\n\n(a)\n\n4.2\n\n0.6\n\n40\u00b0\n20\u00b0\n\n1.5\n\n10\u00b0\n0.4\n2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n-0.01\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\nradial velocity\n\nvelocity along \"azimuthal\" beam\n\nFig. 13.

The synthetics take into account the finite width\nof the ultrasonic beam and the projection of the meridional velocity. The dash\u2013dot\nline is for the numerical simulation of figure 1, in which the electric conductivity\nof the inner sphere is 4.2 times that of the liquid sodium, as expected for copper.\nThe other computations have a reduced inner sphere conductivity ratio of 0.01\n(dot\u2013dot\u2013dash), and 0.04 (solid line). The corresponding angular velocity profile for\nthe latter is also drawn in figure 9. (b) radial velocity synthetics for radial shots at\nlatitudes \u00b140\u25e6 , \u00b120\u25e6 and \u00b110\u25e6 for the latter model. Velocities are normalised with\nthe differential tangential velocity at the equator of the inner sphere, and distances\nare normalised by the radius of the outer sphere.\n\nrenormalizing all data with the \u2206V40\u25e6 proxy. Comparing the spread in figure\n5 with the numerical simulations suggests that the effective conductivity at\nthe sodium/copper interface could be reduced by as much as 100 by wetting\nproblems. We observe that the electric coupling deteriorates with time over\nthe months, but that it can be somewhat revived by letting the copper in\ncontact with liquid sodium at 150\u25e6C during 3 days.\nThe numerical simulations show that the meridional circulation is not very\nsensitive to the conductivity ratio. Radial profiles of the radial velocity are\nshown in figure 13b for the numerical model with the conductivity ratio of\n0.04. As in figure 1b, the circulation is centrifugal at the equator (Ro > 0)\nand the radial velocity is positive at the latitude of 10\u25e6 . It is negative at \u221240\u25e6 ,\nin good agreement with our measurements (figure 12b). At 20\u25e6 , the profile is\nmore complex, but it is also negative near the inner sphere, as experimentally\nobserved (figure 12a). In the numerical model, the radial velocities reach about\n1% of the inner sphere tangential velocity, while it is about twice as large in the\nexperiments. The experiments show clear evidence of a secondary meridional\ncell farther away from the inner sphere.\n27\n\n\f5.4 The peculiar regime for Roef f \u2243 \u22121\nIn the counter\u2013rotating case, the centripetal circulation at the equator, which\ncharacterizes the moderate Rossby number regime, transforms into a centrifugal circulation at the equator as the Rossby number increases. We recall that\nat small Rossby number, the meridional circulation is governed by Hartmann\u2013\npumping at the inner sphere, and is therefore directed towards the inner sphere\nwhen it is counter\u2013rotating, while centrifugation from the inner sphere takes\nover at large Rossby numbers. The transition between the two regimes occurs\nover a narrow interval of \u2206V40\u25e6 , and is marked by a peak of the induced magnetic field. This happens where the effective angular velocity of the fluid is\nsuch that it almost cancels that of the outer sphere, as seen in the laboratory\nframe.\nOur interpretation is that, in a narrow window of \u2206V40\u25e6 , the antagonistic\neffects of the rotation of the outer and inner spheres drive the liquid in a\nstate that shows almost no rotation with respect to the laboratory frame. The\nconstraint of rotation then vanishes, and a vigorous meridional circulation is\nallowed, resulting in an enhanced induced magnetic field.\nSome support for this interpretation is given by a direct measurement of the\nangular velocity using the ultrasonic Doppler technique. As shown in figure 14,\na peculiar profile is measured close to the B peak. An almost uniform angular\nvelocity is measured (down to d \u2243 7.4 cm, i.e. at mid\u2013depth of the fluid shell).\nUsing equation 3, we find a fluid rotation frequency of -5.7 Hz on this plateau.\nSince the ultrasonic probe is installed in the rotating sphere, the angular\nvelocity with respect to the laboratory frame is obtained by adding the angular\nvelocity of the outer sphere. The resulting angular velocity is then -5.7 + 4.2\n= -1.5 Hz, which is small but non zero. Note that the electric potentials (figure\n10) also suggest that, on and beyond the peak, the fluid is nearly in solid\u2013body\nrotation. However, the above scenario is probably too simple, and the variation\nof the induced magnetic field calls for a more sophisticated interpretation. For\nexample, the Br and B\u03b8 records of figure 3 show that the \"centrifugal\" regime\nis announced by a strong rise of B\u03b8 , while Br starts decreasing instead. Besides,\npure solid\u2013body rotation would imply no meridional circulation altogether.\n\n5.5 Implications for experimental dynamos\n\nThe transition between the centripetal and the centrifugal regimes deserves a\nspecific discussion in the context of the preparation of experimental dynamos.\nIn Cardin et al. (2002), we evaluated the possibility to run a dynamo where\nthe forcing is a rotating spherical Couette flow. Such a dynamo would run in\n28\n\n\ffile83\n\nPDF\n\nBRUT\n\nDistance along \"azimuthal\" beam (cm)\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\nVelocity (m/s)\n\nFig. 14. A profile (pdf ) of the angular velocity of the fluid for f = 4.2Hz and\n\u2206f = \u221218.2Hz, for which \u2206V40\u25e6 = \u22121.7mV. This value corresponds to the peak\nobserved for the induced magnetic field.\n\nthe magnetostrophic regime, expected for planetary cores, and it would be of\nthe \u03b1\u03c9\u2013type, displaying large azimuthal magnetic fields. However, the critical magnetic Reynolds number Rmc for these dynamos appears to be high\n(Schaeffer and Cardin, 2006). Indeed, there is an optimum ratio of meridional to azimuthal velocities that yield a minimum Rmc (Ravelet et al., 2005;\nBayliss et al., 2007). Here, we find that, in a rapidly rotating spherical Couette flow, the meridional velocities are at least one order of magnitude smaller\nthan the azimuthal velocities. In contrast, the mean flow in other experiments\n(Peffley et al., 2000; Ravelet et al., 2005; Bayliss et al., 2007) is tuned to be\nclose to an axi\u2013symmetric flow of the Dudley and James (1989) family, with\na strong meridional circulation, yielding an \u03b12 \u2013dynamo, and moderate Rmc\n(Kumar and Roberts, 1975; Dudley and James, 1989). It has been recently\nsuggested that the dynamo efficiency of such flows can be significantly reduced\nby turbulent fluctuations (Bayliss et al., 2007). Now, in the narrow window\nthat corresponds to the transition from the centripetal regime to the centrifugal regime, the magnitude of the meridional circulation becomes comparable\nto the azimuthal one. Thus, the value of the magnetic Reynolds number for\nthe onset of dynamo action may be minimum around this transition. A rotating spherical Couette flow dynamo experiment should thus make it possible\nto observe the transition from an \u03b12 \u2013type (with Rmc perhaps large compared\nto its laminar value) to an \u03b1\u03c9\u2013type dynamo (with a large Rmc for the laminar flow but weak turbulent effects). We are currently conducting extensive\nnumerical simulations of the dynamo instability for spherical Couette flow to\ndocument this effect.\n29\n\n\f5.6 Implications for core dynamics\n\nThe modified Taylor state observed in the DT S experiment bears some relevance to the expected dynamical regime in the Earth's core. Indeed, the\nEkman number based on the expected fluid viscosity is very small, but observations of the nutations reveal that the friction at the core\u2013mantle boundary is\nsome 104 larger than expected for linear Ekman friction (Herring et al., 2002;\nKoot et al., 2008). Although the origin of this enhanced friction is still debated\n(Deleplace and Cardin, 2006; Buffett and Christensen, 2007) and is undoubtedly different from the turbulent friction present in DT S, it would be worth investigating its effect on the dynamics of the core, from a modified Taylor state\npoint of view. Quasi\u2013geostrophic numerical models (Schaeffer and Cardin, 2006),\nin which Ekman friction is parameterized, are a particularly attractive tool\nfor quantifying this effect.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Jean-Paul Masson and Patrick La Rizza for their skillful technical assistance, and Alexandre Fournier for useful discussions.
