Scaling between supermassive and Galactic black hole (GBH) systems should theoretically be very simple. There should be a fundamental similarity between the accretion flow as a function of L/LEdd , with only a weak\ndependence on black hole mass. For example, standard optically\nthick accretion disc models predict that the spectrum should be\ndominated by a multi-temperature blackbody component (Shakura\n& Sunyaev 1973), irrespective of the factor of 105 \u2013108 difference\nin mass. The only significant difference should be the energy at\nwhich the peak in the spectrum is observed (in EFE representation, where FE is energy flux per unit energy). At the Eddington\nluminosity this should be \u223c1 keV in GBH and \u223c10 eV in AGN.\nThe idea of a (mostly) mass-invariant accretion flow is also backed\nby observational evidence for simple scaling relations of the accretion flow between very different mass black holes (Merloni, Heinz\n& di Matteo 2003; Falcke, K\u00f6rding & Markoff 2004).\nHowever, observations also clearly show that the accretion\nc 2005 RAS\n\nflow is much more complicated than the simple Shakura-Sunyaev\ndisc model. GBH show a variety of different types of X-ray spectral and variability behaviour, which are used to classify the accretion flow into different spectral states (e.g. Tanaka & Lewin\n1995; van der Klis 2000; McClintock & Remillard 2005; Done &\nGierli\u0144ski 2003; Zdziarski & Gierli\u0144ski 2004). At high luminosity (L/LEdd & 0.2) the GBH show two main spectral states, the\nhigh/soft (or thermal dominant) and very high (steep power law).\nBoth of these generally have peak energy output at \u223c 1 keV, as\nexpected from an optically thick disc at these high mass accretion\nrates. However, they also show a tail of emission to higher energies\nproduced by Compton scattering of seed photons from the disc by\nenergetic electrons. This tail is rather complex (e.g. Gierli\u0144ski et al.\n1999), but can roughly be described by a power law. In the high/soft\nstate this tail is rather weak and has energy spectral index \u03b1 \u223c 1\n(where FE \u221d E \u2212\u03b1 ) while in the very high state, the tail carries\na large fraction of the bolometric luminosity and has \u03b1 \u223c 1.5.\nConversely, at lower luminosities the GBH can show qualitatively\ndifferent emission, forming the low/hard state. Here they have only\na weak disc component and have a dominant hard Comptonized\n\n\f2\n\nC. Done and M. Gierli\u0144ski\n\ntail. Again its shape is rather complex (e.g. the review by Zdziarski\n& Gierli\u0144ski 2004), but can be roughly described as a power law\nof energy index \u03b1 = 0.5\u20131 (Tanaka & Lewin 1995; McClintock &\nRemillard 2005).\nBy analogy, the AGN should also show these different X-ray\nspectral states (see e.g. White, Fabian & Mushotzky 1984 for an\nearly example of this), and hopefully these intrinsic differences in\nspectra could explain some of the different types of AGN behaviour\nwhich cannot be modelled in simple orientation dependent unification schemes. Very broadly, LINERS have very low L/LEdd , so\nmight correspond to the extreme (hardest spectra) low/hard states\nseen in GBH, many Seyfert 1's are at a few percent of Eddington,\nso could be bright low/hard state, while PG Quasars and especially\nNarrow Line Seyfert 1's (NLS1's) are generally at high L/LEdd ,\nso would correspond to the high/soft or very high states of GBH\n(Pounds, Done & Osborne 1995; see e.g. Woo & Urry 2002, Boronson 2002 and Collin & Kawaguchi 2004 for estimates of L/LEdd ).\nHowever, unlike the GBH, transitions between these states are unobservable, making them more difficult to identify. The GBH make\ntransitions between the spectral states on timescales of a few days\n(e.g. Cui et al. 1997; Wilson & Done 2001; Kalemci et al. 2004).\nThis translates to timescales of 300 to 3 \u00d7 105 years when scaled\nfrom 10 M\u2299 to 106 \u2013109 M\u2299 black hole mass. The one exception is\nthe very luminous system GRS 1915+105, where state transitions\ncan occur on timescales of a few seconds (Belloni et al. 2000), implying 10\u20131000 days timescales in supermassive black holes.\nNonetheless, AGN do show substantial variability in their Xray emission on timescales of days and even hours (e.g. Nandra et\nal. 1997). Instead of true state transitions, this must correspond to\nthe GBH variability seen on much shorter timescales, between milliseconds and seconds. This range of timescales is usually studied\nvia power density spectra (PDS). In the GBH the PDS shape between 0.001\u2013100 Hz is a strong function of the spectral state of the\nsource, showing that the spectral and timing behaviour are generally correlated. For example, in Cyg X-1, the overall shape of the\nPDS in the low/hard state can be approximately described as bandlimited noise in \u03bdP\u03bd representation (where \u03bd is frequency and P\u03bd\nis variability power at that frequency), with a 'flat top' (P\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u22121 )\nso that most of the power is emitted between two break frequencies, \u03bdlow \u223c 0.3 Hz and \u03bdhigh \u223c 3 Hz (e.g. Gilfanov, Churazov\n& Revnivtsev 1999). By contrast, its high/soft state has a highfrequency break at \u223c 14 Hz (e.g. Gilfanov et al. 1999) and no low\nfrequency break, so its overall shape is characteristic of a low-pass\nfilter rather than of band-limited noise.\nHere we look in more detail at the correspondence between\nAGN and GBH power spectra, as there is now a growing number\nof dedicated AGN monitoring campaigns. One of the goals of these\nstudies is to use the characteristic timescales in the PDS to estimate\nthe black hole mass in AGN. In particular we stress that the highfrequency break is not constant, even within the low/hard state, so\nwhile this break can be used as an indicator of black hole mass, it\ncannot be used to make accurate predictions. We also stress that at\nhigh mass accretion rates the GBH energy spectra are often dominated by the disc emission This has very little variability compared\nto the Comptonized tail (Churazov, Gilfanov & Revnivtsev 2001),\nso it suppresses the rms variability in the high/soft state GBH. The\nmuch lower disc temperature in AGN means that their spectra are\ndominated by the Comptonized tail, so this bandpass effect means\nthat AGN can have much higher apparent rms variability. This removes one of the problems in identifying the often rapidly variable\nnarrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies (Leighly 1999) as the supermassive\ncounterparts of the high/soft state (Pounds et al. 1995), while other\n\nissues due to the shape of the PDS can be resolved by recognizing\nthe diversity of possible high mass accretion rate states. We caution\nthat Cyg X-1 does not sample a large range in mass accretion rate,\nand shows a possibly unique PDS in its high/soft state, so using\nthis object as a template for AGN behaviour can severely distort\nattempts to scale the variability between supermassive and stellar\nblack holes.\n\n2 POWER SPECTRA OF GBH\n2.1 The data\nWe extract power density spectra of several GBH corresponding\nto various spectral states in (1/256)\u2013128 Hz frequency band from\nthe Proportional Counter Array (PCA) onboard Rossi X-ray Timing\nExplorer (RXTE). These PDS, shown in Fig. 1 in black, are calculated over the full energy band of the PCA (2\u201360 keV). We also\nextract high-energy power spectra, from \u223c 13-25 keV (starting at\nPCA channel 36 for Cyg X-1 and XTE J1550\u2013564, and 26 for XTE\nJ1650\u2013500, and ending at channel 71 to avoid the background dominated energies), shown in Fig. 1 in light grey (cyan in colour). This\nhigh-energy band excludes most of the disc emission, so these PDS\nshow the variability of the Comptonized tail alone.\nWe also extract both PCA and HEXTE energy spectra from\nthe same observations using standard extraction and background\nsubtraction criteria. These are shown in Fig. 2, where they are\ndeconvolved from the instrument responses using the best-fitting\nmodel consisting of a multicolour accretion disc (DISKBB: Mitsuda et al. 1984), complex Comptonization (EQPAIR: Coppi 1999)\nand its reflection (Magdziarz & Zdziarski 1995; plus DISKLINE :\nFabian et al. 1989). The total spectral model is also shown corrected for interstellar absorption. The power and energy spectra in\nFigs. 1 and 2 were extracted from observations with the following\narchival numbers a: 50110-01-38-01 (L/LEdd = 0.011), b: 6011301-04-00 (0.049), c: 80135-01-02-00 (0.033), d: 10512-01-09-00\n(0.063), e: 60113-01-19-00 (0.060), and f: 30191-01-13-00 (0.25).\nAll L/LEdd values are calculated using bolometric luminosity estimated from the best-fitting model shown in Fig. 2. We used distances of 2 (Herrero et al. 1995), 5.3 (Orosz et al. 2002) and 4 kpc\n(Tomsick et al. 2003) and masses of 10 (Gierli\u0144ski et al. 1999), 10\n(Orosz et al. 2002) and 10 M\u2299 (Orosz et al. 2004) for Cyg X-1,\nXTE J1550\u2013564 and XTE J1650\u2013500, respectively.\n\n2.2 Low/hard state\nCyg X-1 is often used as the 'canonical' GBH. Figs. 1(a) and 2(a)\nshow a typical power and energy spectrum from its low/hard state.\nThe PCA energy spectrum is dominated by the hard Comptonized\ncomponent, with little emission from the soft component visible in\nthe data. The power spectra of the PCA data over the full- and highenergy bandpass are remarkably similar, with integrated fractional\nrms of 26.4 \u00b1 0.2 and 24.8 \u00b1 0.5 per cent, respectively, showing\nthat the major variability on these timescales is produced by the\nnormalization of the tail varying, rather than its spectral shape. The\ntypical low/hard state band-limited noise is evident in the PDS, with\nmost of the power contained between \u223c 0.2\u20133 Hz so that the flat\ntop spans an order of magnitude in frequency.\nAs opposed to the Cyg X-1, which is a persistent high-mass\nX-ray binary, the low-mass X-ray binary XTE J1650\u2013500 is a transient source. Its low/hard state PDS is shown in Fig. 1(b), with\nc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20139\n\n\fScaling black hole variability\n\n3\n\nFigure 1.

These data were chosen so that the energy spectrum closely matched that of Cyg X1 in Fig. 2(a). The power spectra are similar, but differ in detail.\nFirstly, the shape of the power spectrum is less smooth \u2013 the bandlimited noise is more clearly associated with QPO components in\nXTE J1650\u2013500 than in Cyg X-1. Secondly the total rms is actually slightly decreased at higher energies, with 19.8 \u00b1 0.1 per cent\ncompared to 24.5 \u00b1 0.1 in the full energy band, showing that the\nComptonizing tail is pivoting with changing soft photon input (see\nZdziarski et al. 2002 for similar behaviour in some 'failed transition' Cyg X-1 data).\nTransient GBH allow us to probe the behaviour of the power\nspectra over a much wider range of low/hard states than are sampled by Cyg X-1, which actually varies rather little in total bolometric power (e.g. Done & Gierli\u0144ski 2003). Fig. 1(c) shows the\npower spectra of an extreme low/hard state from another transient,\nXTE J1550\u2013564, where the (approximately) flat part of the power\nspectrum now extends over \u223c 2.5 orders of magnitude in frequency.\nThe corresponding energy spectrum (Fig. 2c) shows that the Comptonized tail completely dominates the emission. The total rms variability of the power spectra is unchanged between the full PCA\nand high-energy PCA bandpasses, at 40.8 \u00b1 0.4 and 39.8 \u00b1 0.7 per\ncent, respectively, showing that the variability is dominated by simply the normalization of the tail, as in the Cyg X-1 low/hard data\n(Fig. 1a).\nWe can track the variation in these characteristic frequencies\nin the power spectrum throughout the low/hard state in this transient system. While multiple Lorentzian components are required\nto properly fit the PDS shape (Nowak 2000; Belloni, Psaltis & van\nder Klis 2003; Pottschmidt et al. 2003), the broad shape can be\nc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20139\n\nfairly well approximated by two Lorentzians (e.g. Axelsson, Borgonovo & Larsson 2005). We fitted the XTE J1550\u2013564 power\nspectra from its 2000 and 2002 outbursts where the source was in\nthe low/hard state by two Lorentzians, which gave a good description of the data. We also fitted the PCA/HEXTE broad-band energy spectra with a simple model consisting of the disc blackbody\nand thermal Comptonization (the model used by Done & Gierli\u0144ski\n2003) and used it to estimate the bolometric luminosity as a fraction of Eddington luminosity. The resulting peak frequencies of the\ntwo Lorentzians as a function of luminosity are shown in Fig. 3(a).\nHowever, doubly broken power laws are generally used to fit\nAGN data. We would like to stress that generally these are not good\ndescription of the GBH power spectra, where much better statistics reveals complex spectral shape, not entirely consistent with a\ndoubly broken power law. Nevertheless, we fitted the XTE J1550\u2013\n564 power spectra by this model for comparison. We fixed the\nlow- frequency PDS slope at zero, and the high-frequency slope\nat \u22122, and fitted for the low- and high-frequency breaks and the\n'flat top' slope (which is generally close to unity), together with\nthe overall normalization. We show the best-fitting break frequencies in Fig. 3(b). Though the break frequencies are different then\nthe Lorentzian peak frequencies, the general behaviour from both\nmodels is similar: both frequencies move. This is more apparent\nfor the low frequency break, which can change by at least a factor\nof \u223c 50 between the outbursts, while the high-frequency break can\nchange by at least a factor \u223c 5 from the same object. This clearly\nshows that characteristic frequencies in the low/hard state power\nspectra cannot be used as an accurate tracer of black hole mass.\nWe stress that these data are all taken from within the low/hard\nstate, with energy spectral index \u03b1 \u223c1.5\u20131.6 and are not interme-\n\n\f4\n\nC.

The dash-dotted curve represents unabsorbed total model.\n\ndiate state or transition spectra. However, the behaviour seen in the\n2000 outburst, where the low frequency break moves by much more\nthan the high-frequency break, continues into the hard-to-soft transition. This has the effect of decreasing the extent of the flat top and\nhence decreasing to the total rms (Gilfanov et al. 1999; Churazov\net al. 2001; Pottschmidt et al. 2003, Axelsson et al. 2005). A very\nsimple model for this correlated spectral and variability change is\none in which a hot inner flow filters a spectrum of fluctuations from\nan outer cool disc. The inner and outer radius of the hot flow determines the high- and low-frequency breaks, respectively. As the disc\nmoves inwards, the outer edge of the hot flow decreases, and \u03bdlow\nincreases (Churazov et al. 2001), while the increasing disc flux for\nCompton scattering means that the spectrum gets softer.\n\n2.3 High/soft state\nFigs. 1(d) and 2(d) show power and energy spectra of a typical\nCyg X-1 high/soft state. The energy spectrum is now dominated by\nthe disc component in the lowest PCA channels, but with a tail to\nhigher energies. The disc emission is rather constant, while the tail\nis more variable (Churazov et al. 2001) so the contribution of the\ndisc to the PCA spectrum will clearly suppress the rms variability observed. Fig. 1(d) shows that the total rms observed increases\nfrom 19.9 \u00b1 0.5 to 27.3 \u00b1 1.2 per cent when the power spectrum\nis made from the high-energy data alone, where there is negligible\ndisc emission. The power spectral shape is also clearly very different to that seen in the low/hard state. Its shape is now similar to\na low pass filter, with only a single characteristic frequency which\n\nFigure 3.

These were chosen to closely\nmatch the energy spectrum to that seen from the Cyg X-1 high/soft\nc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20139\n\n\fScaling black hole variability\ndata (Fig. 2e). Despite the strong energy spectral similarities, the\npower spectra are markedly different to that from the high/soft state\nin Cyg X-1 (Fig. 1d). The power spectrum of the high/soft state of\nXTE J1650\u2013500 is strongly peaked. This matches smoothly onto\nthe softest low/hard state power spectra described above, where the\nflat part of the power spectrum shrinks to a very small frequency\nrange. Cyg X-1 can also show such peaked power spectra (during\nits 'failed' transitions to the high/soft state, Pottschmidt et al. 2003),\nbut its 'canonical' high/soft power spectrum seems dominated by a\nrather different power spectral component (see Fig. 1(d), also Fig\n16 of Axelsson et al. 2005).\nThe spectrum of the high/soft state of XTE J1650\u2013500 shows\nthat the disc spectrum dominates the low energy PCA bandpass,\nso can strongly suppress the apparent variability. The Compton tail\nalone (high-energy PCA bandpass) has rms variability of 26.2 \u00b1\n1.8 per cent, whereas including the lower energy, disc dominated\nchannels gives total variability of only 7.2 \u00b1 0.2 per cent.\nIt is rather difficult accumulate enough signal-to-noise in the\npower spectra of the hard tail in the high/soft state of GBH, especially when the disc has high temperature. Even if the tail is \u223c 10\nper cent of the bolometric luminosity, its contribution to the total\nPCA count rate is much smaller for a high-temperature disc than for\na lower temperature one due to the decreasing instrument response\nat higher energies. However, we have examined all the available\nhigh-energy power spectra from the outbursts of many GBH and\nhave never seen a high/soft state PDS which resembles that of the\n'canonical' high/soft state derived from Cyg X-1. The high-energy\npower spectra are typically complex or strongly peaked, and show\na variable rms from 5 \u2212 30 per cent.\nThus the Compton tail in the transient GBH shows a rather\nvaried power spectrum in the high/soft state. It can be highly variable, with rms of \u223c 30 per cent, or it can be fairly constant (though\nstill more variable than the disc) with rms of \u223c 5 per cent, but\nclearly there is no well defined power spectral amplitude. However,\nwhere the tail has high rms variability, as seen in Cyg X-1, its shape\nis very different, showing strongly peaked noise which resembles\nQPO components rather than the smooth low pass filter characteristic of Cyg X-1. The only transient GBH convincingly show a flat\nPDS extending over more than 3 orders of magnitude in frequency\nare those showing extreme low/hard energy spectra (Fig. 1c).\n2.4 The very high state\nFigs. 1(f) and 2(f) show the power and energy spectra of the very\nhigh state of XTE J1550\u2013564. The energy spectrum clearly has a\ndisc component, but the Comptonized emission is also very strong,\nand dominates most of the PCA emission. The power spectral\nshape, especially at high energies, is similar to the low/hard state\npower spectra i.e. band-limited noise, except that the QPO is much\nstronger and dominates the PDS (and makes the GBH PDS impossible to fit with the broken power law model). The total rms for the\nfull- and high-energy bandpass are 23.3 \u00b1 0.1 and 32.3 \u00b1 0.2 per\ncent respectively, so clearly again the variability is more marked by\nexcluding the disc emission, but the effect is not so drastic as in\nthe high/soft state as the strong tail means the disc dilution is not\nso important. All very high state power spectra have high rms, and\nhave this rather typical peaked noise shape, with strong QPOs.\nVery high luminosities, even exceeding LEdd , can be seen\nfrom GRS 1915+105. While this source can show unique variability modes, probably connected with its uniquely high accretion rate\n(Done, Wardzi\u0144ski & Gierli\u0144ski 2004), it spends about half of its\ntime in a rather stable very high state (class \u03c7: Belloni et al. 2000).\nc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20139\n\n5\n\nPDS of these data show that they are very similar to those shown\nhere for XTE J1550\u2013564, with variability increasing at higher energies (Zdziarski et al. 2005).\n\n3 APPLICATION TO AGN\nThe GBH power and energy spectra shown in Figs 1 and 2 span the\nrange of spectral states seen. However, they also illustrate the well\u2013\nknown lack of clean 1 to 1 correspondence between spectral state\nand luminosity (e.g. van der Klis 2001; McClintock & Remillard\n2005) as all except the very high state are within a factor few from\nL/LEdd \u223c 0.03. While in general the low/hard state is seen at\nL/LEdd < 0.05, it can extend up to \u223c 0.2 on the rapid rise to\noutburst. As we have yet to clearly understand the relation between\nGBH and AGN energy spectra, we use L/LEdd as a guide to AGN\nspectral state. Those with L/LEdd > 0.2 are likely to correspond\nto high mass accretion rate GBH i.e. high/soft or very high state.\nThe much longer timescales involved mean that only a few\nAGN have been monitored to the extent that power spectra can be\nderived. The power spectra are also more complex to calculate than\nthose from GBH as the data are generally unevenly sampled. This\ngives a broad window function which redistributes power over a\nwide range of frequencies, so reconstructing the intrinsic power\nspectrum is analogous to deriving the intrinsic energy spectrum\nfrom the broad spectral response of an X-ray proportional counter.\nTechniques for this reconstruction generally rely on Monte-Carlo\nsimulations of the stochastic noise properties of a given power spectral form through the specific uneven sampling pattern corresponding to each AGN (Done et al. 1992; Uttley, McHardy & Papadakis\n2002). These derived power spectra typically become less well defined at the lowest frequencies, so the uncertainties increase in the\nlast decade in frequency of each reconstruction.\nTable 1 gives basic data (black hole mass and Eddington fraction, which are uncertain by factors of at least 2\u20133) of a compilation\nof AGN from the literature which have published power spectra,\nwhich we reproduce the best-fitting models in Fig. 4a) and b) for\nlow and high mass accretion rates, respectively.\nThe different disc temperatures expected in AGN and GBH\nmeans that there is a bandpass effect which masks the expected similarities in the spectra and variability of the accretion flow. While\nthe X-ray spectra of both AGN and GBH should be dominated by\nthe hard Comptonized tail at low L/LEdd , the higher temperature\ndisc expected in the GBH means that this dominates their X-ray\nemission in the high/soft and very high states, while the corresponding AGN spectra will be dominated by the soft Comptonized\ntail seen in these states (see also McHardy et al. 2004). Thus the\nAGN power spectra should be compared only to the high-energy\npower spectra in GBH (cyan points in Fig 1) not that derived from\nthe total X-ray bandpass (black points).\nHowever, there is also a secondary issue which is the shape\nof the power spectrum. Cyg X-1 is not representative of the majority of the GBH in terms of its power spectra, despite being used\nas the 'canonical' object. Firstly, it is a persistent source, spanning\nvery little range in bolometric luminosity, so never shows a very\nhigh state, nor an extreme low/hard state. Even over its limited observed range in L/LEdd it generally has a different power spectra\nto those of other (transient) GBH with similar energy spectra. In\nits high/soft state this is very marked, as the power spectra of the\nCompton tail has approximately equal power per decade between\n10\u22123 and 10 Hz (probably extending down below 10\u22126 Hz: Reig,\nPapadakis & Kylafis 2002), giving a high rms of \u223c 30 per cent.\n\n\f6\n\nC. Done and M. Gierli\u0144ski\n\nBy contrast the transient GBH with equivalent energy spectra show\nCompton tail power spectra which are often sharply peaked, or are\ncomplex, and have rms from 5 \u2212 30 per cent. The low/hard state\npower spectrum of Cyg X-1 is also subtly different from those seen\nin the transient systems, in that the QPO features are generally less\nmarked.\n3.1 Low L/LEdd AGN\nA key goal of the AGN PDS studies is to use the high-frequency\nbreak as a tracer of black hole mass. Fig. 3 shows that the highfrequency break of a broken power law description of the low/hard\nGBH PDS remains constant to within a factor \u223c 5, so while this\ncannot be used as an accurate tracer of black hole mass, it may give\na zeroth order indication.\nThe AGN shown in the left panel of Fig. 4 with L/LEdd <\n0.20 could correspond to a variety of spectral states. Nonetheless, their PDS are consistent with being similar in both normalization and shape, and the majority of AGN on this plot (all with\nrather similar masses around \u223c 107.5 M\u2299 and accretion rates of\nL/LEdd \u223c 0.1: see Table 1), are compatible with scaling the highfrequency break from that seen in the bright low/hard state of Cyg\nX-1.\nHowever, there are two clear exceptions to this, both of which\nare substantially lower L/LEdd objects. NGC 4258 again has similar mass of around \u223c 107.5 M\u2299 , so its lower frequency break could\nbe due to it corresponding to a more extreme low/hard state (see\nFig 3). This is a clear counterexample to the idea of a universal PDS\nshape which depends only on mass (e.g Papadakis 2004; O'Neill et\nal. 2005), as indeed is shown by Fig. 3.\nHowever, the lowest mass AGN known, NGC4395, is not so\neasy to fit into this pattern. From the reverberation mass, it should\nhave a high-frequency break only a factor 100 higher than that from\nthe other objects. Yet its break is \u223c 4 \u2212 5 orders of magnitude\nhigher than that for NGC 4258, the most obvious object to scale\nfrom in terms of similarly low L/LEdd , and \u223c 3 orders of magnitude from the majority of AGN in the figure. Either there is truly\na difference in the variability properties of AGN and GBH, or the\nblack hole mass in NGC 4395 is overestimated. Some evidence for\nthe latter possibility is that this is the only object which has significantly different masses inferred from reverberation and stellar velocity dispersion estimates (refs). Assuming instead that the mass\nis \u223c 104 M\u2299 , consistent with the stellar velocity upper limit, this\ngives L/LEdd \u223c 0.04 and the PDS scales with mass in the same\nway as the majority of AGN on the figure.\n3.2 High L/LEdd AGN\nBy contrast, Fig. 4b shows those AGN with L/LEdd > 0.20. Most\nof these have masses of \u223c 106.5 M\u2299 but their PDS are very heterogeneous. This corresponds well with the multiple different types of\nPDS shape which can be seen in the high/soft and very high states\nfrom GBH.\nTwo of these AGN (NGC 4051 and MCG-6-30-15, both\nNLS1's) clearly show flat noise power extending over more than 4\ndecades in frequency. These look very like that of the high/soft state\nin Cyg X-1, taking into account uncertainties in the low frequency\nslope of the power spectra (McHardy et al. 2004; 2005). The total\nrms power in both is of order 25 per cent, again similar to that of\nthe Comptonized tail in the high/soft state of Cyg X-1 (McHardy\net al. 2004). Thus these AGN can be interpreted as the supermassive counterpart of the high/soft state Cyg X-1 data, which is not\n\nlike the majority of transient GBH power spectra at high accretion\nrates.\nHowever, another NLS1, Akn564, convincingly shows bandlimited flat top noise, where the flat top extends over only \u223c2\ndecades in frequency (Fig. 4 taken from a combination of lowand high-frequency data in Markowitz et al. 2003 and Vignali et al.\n2004). Such band-limited, high rms (\u223c 30 per cent) noise is consistent with the extreme low/hard state of GBH (Fig. 1c). However,\nAkn 564 has high L/LEdd \u223c 1 (Table 1), so should instead be\ncomparable to the high mass accretion rate GBH. Its PDS is clearly\nunlike that of NGC 4051 (and the high/soft state of Cyg X-1). Instead it could correspond to the PDS of the Compton tail seen in the\nvery high state (transient) GBH. These likewise show band-limited\nnoise similar to that of the low/hard state, with the flat top extending over two decades in frequency, though this is usually accompanied by a strong QPO (Fig. 1f, Zdziarski et al. 2005). However,\ncurrent AGN data probably cannot rule out the presence of even a\nvery strong QPO such as that seen in the very high state since the\nuneven sampling strongly smears out the power (Vaughan & Uttley\n2005). If a QPO is not present with better sampling of the AGN\nlight curve then it may be that Akn 564 instead represents a scaled\nup version of a very high state from a persistent GBH. There are\nas yet no data on such GBH systems (Cyg X-1 never shows a very\nhigh state), but we speculate by analogy with the Cyg X-1 low/hard\nstate PDS that these would have weaker QPO features than those\nseen in the transient systems.\nBand-limited noise is also probably detected in another high\nL/LEdd AGN, NGC 3783 (Markowitz et al. 2003). Here the situation is rather less clear, as L/LEdd \u223c 0.2, i.e. close to the maximum low/hard state luminosity. Uncertainties in mass and bolometric luminosity mean this could easily fall or rise by a factor 2\u2013\n3. Thus this could either represent a bright low/hard state or a dim\nvery high state (sometimes termed an intermediate state: Belloni\net al. 1996; M\u00e9ndez & van der Klis 1997). These different 'states'\nmerge smoothly together in the GBH, which can be explained in\nthe context of a truncated disc extending closer to the black hole,\nincreasing the overlap between the disc and hot inner flow as the\nsource moves from low/hard to intermediate and very high states\n(Wilson & Done 2001; Kubota & Done 2004).\nThe only other high L/LEdd AGN with published power\nspectrum is the NLS1, Mkn766. Here there is no data on long\ntimescales, but the (evenly sampled) XMM-Newton data strongly\nindicate a break at \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 Hz (Vaughan & Fabian 2003;\nVaughan, Fabian & Iwasawa 2004). The normalization of the flat\ntop noise is lower than that for the other AGN (high or low\nL/LEdd ), so this may correspond to a high state counterpart of\na transient GBH.\n\n4 THE HIGH/SOFT STATE OF CYG X-1 AND ITS\nIMPLICATIONS FOR AGN\nDespite its use a template PDS, Cyg X-1's timing properties are not\ntypical of GBH. The high/soft state PDS is markedly different, with\nflat top (in \u03bdP\u03bd ) extending over at least four orders of magnitude in\nfrequency. By contrast, power spectra of the Compton tail in other\nGBH in the high/soft state are instead usually strongly peaked at\n\u223c10 Hz, or have complex shapes.\nThe difference in Cyg X-1 is perhaps connected to the persistent nature of its emission due to the large accretion rate from\nits high-mass companion OB star. The X-ray bolometric luminosity varies by very little, L/LEdd = 0.01\u20130.1, over timescales of\nc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20139\n\n\fScaling black hole variability\n\n7\n\nFigure 4.

The references are as\nfollows: [FH03] Filippenko & Ho 2003; [MU05] Markowitz & Uttley 2005; [M03] Markowitz et al. 2003; [M04] McHardy et al. 2004; [M05] McHardy et\nal. 2005; [P02] Papadakis et al. 2002; [P05] Peterson et al. 2005; [R04] Romano et al. 2004; [VF03] Vaughan & Fabian 2003; [VFI04] Vaughan, Fabian &\nIwasawa 2004; [V03] Vignali et al. 2003; [WU02] Woo & Urry 2002. Ref.1 refers to the mass and luminosity estimate, Ref.2 to the power spectrum shown in\nFig. 4.\n\nweeks\u2013years. By contrast, most GBH have low-mass companions,\nwith much lower mass transfer rates through the Roche lobe so have\ntransient outbursts where the accretion flow luminosity changes\nfrom L/LEdd . 10\u22127 to 0.05\u20131 (e.g. McClintock, Narayan & Rybicki 2004). We speculate that the large dynamic range of variability seen in transients may excite a rather different noise spectrum of\nturbulence in the disc. The observed PDS is the convolution of this\nintrinsic power spectrum with the response of the disc (e.g. Psaltis\n& Norman 2000). For a particular disc geometry, the response of\nthe disc (its filter) is fixed (Churazov et al. 2001; Psaltis & Norman\n2000), but if the intrinsic noise spectrum changes then the observed\nPDS will also change.\nIt is currently unclear whether the disc instability which causes\nthe dramatic outbursts in the transient GBH should also operate in\nAGN i.e. whether the initial spectrum of fluctuations is similar to\nthat in Cyg X-1 or the transient GBH. The instability is triggered\nby the dramatic increase in opacity caused by the partial ionization of hydrogen at temperatures of \u223c 104 K. Such temperatures\nare clearly expected in AGN (Siemiginowska, Czerny & Kostyunin\nc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20139\n\n1996; Burderi, King & Szuszkiewicz 1998). However, this needs to\npropagate globally through the disc rather than being a purely local\ninstability in order to produce dramatic outbursts, which requires a\nchange in the effective \u03b1 viscosity parameter. This is probably produced in GBH discs by a change in viscosity mechanism, from the\nMRI where hydrogen is ionized, to much weaker processes (eg spiral arms) where hydrogen is neutral. Physically, this could be linked\nto the large change in density of free electrons between the parts\nof the disc in which hydrogen is ionized and neutral. If the neutral disc is very neutral, then the lack of charge carriers suppresses\nthe coupling of magnetic fields to the disc, shutting off the MRI\nviscosity (Gammie & Menou 1998). However, AGN discs at the\ncritical hydrogen ionization temperature are much less dense than\nGBH discs at this temperature. Recombination processes, especially three body recombination, will be much less efficient at these\nlower densities, so while hydrogen is mainly neutral there may be\nenough free electrons from potassium/iron etc to allow the MRI to\nstill operate as a viscosity mechanism (Menou & Quataert 2001).\nThus the hydrogen ionization point would not trigger a global in-\n\n\f8\n\nC. Done and M. Gierli\u0144ski\n\nstability in AGN discs (Janiuk et al. 2004). However, this is still\nto some extent speculative, so it is not yet known whether we expect AGN variability to be more like persistent GBH (i.e. Cyg X-1)\nor like the transients. The observation of a Cyg X-1 like high/soft\npower spectrum in the nearby NLS1 NGC 4051 argues for a suppression of the hydrogen ionization disc instability in this AGN,\nwhere the flat part of the power spectrum extends over more than\n4 decades in frequency (McHardy et al. 2004). The lack of clear\nQPO signatures in AGN (while mainly due to lack of statistics on\nthe relevant timescales: e.g. Vaughan 2005) may also be a feature\nof a different disc turbulence spectrum characteristic of persistent\nsources. Better AGN power spectra, with better constraints on potential QPO signatures could give observational insights into the\noperation of the MRI and hydrogen ionization instability in these\nmassive discs.\n\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nPower spectra of AGN are used to estimate the black hole mass by\nscaling characteristic timescales (breaks) to those seen in the Galactic sources, most commonly using Cyg X-1 as the template PDS.\nHowever, this assumes that the PDS shape is constant, while the\nGBH show clearly that the characteristic frequencies change significantly even within a single GBH state, and that the whole shape\nof the PDS can change with state transitions. However, this does\nnot mean that scaling cannot yield useful constraints, though it certainly cannot give accurate black hole masses. The high-frequency\nbreak changes by only a factor \u223c 5 within the low/hard state of\nGBH, and this is rather less than the discrepancy inferred from relating break frequency to mass for the lowest mass known AGN,\nNGC 4395. Either the mass of this black hole is overestimated (for\nwhich there is some additional evidence), or there is some other\nvariability process occurring which breaks the correspondence between this AGN and the GBH.\nAt high mass accretion rates, the X-ray spectra from GBH can\nbe dominated by the rather stable disc emission, while the much\nlower disc temperature in AGN means that their X-ray spectra\nare dominated instead by the Compton tail. This bandpass effect\nmeans that the low variability often cited as being characteristic of\nthe high/soft state is characteristic of the disc. At higher energies,\nwhere Comptonization dominates, GBH can exhibit large amplitudes of variability, as required to match with AGN, especially the\nNLS1's. The shape of the PDS in the high/soft state is generally\nstrongly peaked, not at all like the low pass filter PDS characteristic\nof the high/soft state in Cyg X- 1. Since some NLS1s (NGC 4051\nand MCG-6-30-15: McHardy et al. 2004; 2005) show PDS which\nlook convincingly like Cyg X-1, we speculate that the Hydrogen\nionization instability (which gives rise to the transient behaviour\nin GBH) does not operate in AGN. However, there are also some\nNLS1's which show band-limited PDS, similar to those seen in the\nlow/hard state. We show that such PDS can also be interpreted as\ntransient high/soft state PDS or very high state PDS, so that bandlimited noise is not a unique tracer of low mass accretion rates.\nAGN variability can be interpreted as the supermassive analogue of the GBH variability, but only with careful matching of\nspectral states, and careful consideration of the different spectral\ncomponents.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank A.
