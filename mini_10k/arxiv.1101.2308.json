The\nclassification of the finite subgroups of SU(3) began with the work of H.F. Blichfeldt\nat the beginning of the 20th century. In Blichfeldt's work the two series (C) and\n(D) of finite subgroups of SU(3) are defined. While the group series \u2206(3n2 ) and\n\u2206(6n2 ) (which are subseries of (C) and (D), respectively) have been intensively\nstudied, there is not much knowledge about the group series (C) and (D). In this\nwork we will show that (C) and (D) have the structures (C) \u223c\n= (Zm \u00d7 Zm\u2032 ) \u22ca Z3 and\n\u223c\n(D) = (Zn \u00d7 Zn\u2032 ) \u22ca S3 , respectively. Furthermore we will show that, while the (C)groups can be interpreted as irreducible representations of \u2206(3n2 ), the (D)-groups\ncan in general not be interpreted as irreducible representations of \u2206(6n2 ).\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nToday finite groups are widely used in physics, and particle physics offers a wide range of\napplications for the theory of finite groups in particular. Especially the finite subgroups\nof SU(3) have been intensively studied in the past, and their investigation and application\nin various fields of particle physics continues unabated.\nThe systematic analysis of finite subgroups of SU(3) for application in particle physics\nstarted with the work of Fairbairn, Fulton and Klink [1] in 1964. Since then many\ncontributions to a systematic analysis of these groups for application in particle physics\nhave been published. The finite subgroups of SU(3) have been used for model building in\nhadron physics [1], as well as a computational tool in lattice QCD (see e.g. [2]). Today's\nmost important application is flavour physics: On the one hand there is an enormous\n\u2217\n\nE-mail: patrick.ludl@univie.ac.at\n\n1\n\n\famount of models using finite subgroups of SU(3) (see e.g. [3, 4] and references therein)\ntrying to solve the fermion mass and mixing problems in the lepton sector as well as the\nquark sector. On the other hand finite subgroups of SU(3) have also been used in the\ncontext of minimal flavour violation (see e.g. [5]).\nThe well-known group series Tn , \u2206(3n2 ) and \u2206(6n2 ) are sub-series of the series (C)\nand (D) [6] of finite subgroups of SU(3). However, (C) and (D) also contain other groups,\nwhich have been paid much less attention. The aim of this work is to study the structure\nof the finite subgroups of SU(3) of type (C) and (D) and their relation to other finite\nsubgroups of SU(3).\n\nThe classification of the finite subgroups of SU(3)\nHere we want to list the main efforts that have been put in the classification of the finite\nsubgroups of SU(3) in chronological order.\n\u2022 In 1916 G.A. Miller, H.F. Blichfeldt and L.E. Dickson published their book Theory\nand Applications of Finite Groups [6]. In the part written by H.F. Blichfeldt the\nfinite subgroups of SU(3) are classified in terms of their generators. The series\n\u2206(3n2 ) and \u2206(6n2 ) are not explicitly defined but are contained in the series (C)\nand (D).\n\u2022 In 1964 the article Finite and Disconnected Subgroups of SU(3) and their Application\nto the Elementary-Particle Spectrum by W.M. Fairbairn, T. Fulton and W.H. Klink\nwas published [1]. It was the first paper which faced the task of analyzing a large set\nof finite subgroups of SU(3) for their use as symmetries in particle physics (hadron\nphysics in this special case). In [1] the group series \u2206(3n2 ) and \u2206(6n2 ) are already\nincluded.\n\u2022 In their articles Representations and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of Z-metacyclic\ngroups [7] and Finite subgroups of SU(3) [8] (both published in 1981) A. Bovier,\nM. L\u00fcling and D. Wyler defined and analyzed the SU(3)-subgroups Tn . Especially\nthey constructed all irreducible representations and calculated all Clebsch-Gordan\ncoefficients for these groups. Furthermore Bovier et al. investigated the group series\n\u2206(3n2 ) and \u2206(6n2 ) in detail giving not only the irreducible representations but also\nthe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for both series.\n\u2022 Two years later, in their paper Some comments on finite subgroups of SU(3) [9],\nW.M. Fairbairn and T. Fulton proved that some groups of the type Tn given by\nBovier et al. in [8] are not subgroups of SU(3).\n\u2022 In 2007 C. Luhn, S. Nasri and P. Ramond published their work The Flavor Group\n\u2206(3n2 ) [10], giving all conjugacy classes, irreducible representations, character tables\nand Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of \u2206(3n2 ).\n\u2022 In 2008 J.A. Escobar and C. Luhn published their analysis The Flavor Group\n\u2206(6n2 ) [11], giving all conjugacy classes, irreducible representations, character tables and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of \u2206(6n2 ).\n2\n\n\f\u2022 In 2009 the work Systematic analysis of finite family symmetry groups and their\napplication to the lepton sector [3] was published. It contains an analysis and summary of all finite subgroups of SU(3). With the help of [10] it could be shown that\nall SU(3)-subgroups of type (C) can be interpreted as three-dimensional irreducible\nrepresentations of \u2206(3n2 ). The generators of the group series (D) were determined\nexplicitly.\nIn the same year R. Zwicky and T. Fischbacher showed that every (D)-group is a\nsubgroup of \u2206(6n2 ) for a suitable n in their article On discrete Minimal Flavour\nViolation [5].\n\u2022 In the work On the finite subgroups of U(3) of order smaller than 512 [12] (published\nin 2010) all finite subgroups of U(3) of order smaller than 512 which possess a faithful\nthree-dimensional irreducible representation are listed.1 Among these groups there is\nno SU(3)-subgroup which does not fit into the classification scheme of Blichfeldt [6].\nIn their article Tribimaximal Mixing From Small Groups [13] K.M. Parattu and\nA. Wingerter began to analyze also those finite subgroups of U(3) which possess\na faithful three-dimensional reducible representation but which do not possess any\nfaithful irreducible representation. Their analysis of all groups up to order 100\nshows no finite subgroups of SU(3) which do not fit into Blichfeldt's classification\nscheme [6].\nTable 1 shows the different types of finite subgroups of SU(3), as they are classified by\nnow. Especially it contains all finite subgroups of SO(3), see [14, 19], as follows:\n\u2022 The uniaxial groups (groups of rotations about one axis) are cyclic and thus isomorphic to Zn = A(n, 1).\n\u2022 The dihedral groups possess faithful two-dimensional representations and are thus\ncontained in B.\n\u2022 The tetrahedral group is isomorphic to A4 \u223c\n= \u2206(12).\n\u2022 The octahedral group is isomorphic to S4 \u223c\n= \u2206(24).\n\u2022 The icosahedral group is isomorphic to A5 \u223c\n= \u03a3(60).\nOnly two of the groups presented in table 1 are not contained in the list given by Blichfeldt\nin [6], namely the direct products \u03a3(60) \u00d7 Z3 and \u03a3(168) \u00d7 Z3 .\n\n2\n\nAbelian subgroups of SU(3)\n\nIn the following sections we will frequently deal with Abelian subgroups of SU(3). The\nremarkably simple theorem 2.1 provides us with all necessary information we will need in\nour later analysis.\nThe list in [12] contains only those groups which are not isomorphic to a group of the form H \u00d7 Zn\nwith n > 1.\n1\n\n3\n\n\fGroup\nA(m, n) \u223c\n= Zm \u00d7 Zn (Abelian groups), n divides m\nB (finite subgroups of U(2))\nC(n, a, b)\nD(n, a, b; d, r, s)\n\u2206(3n2 ) \u223c\n= C(n, 0, 1), n \u2265 2\n\u2206(6n2 ) \u223c\n= D(n, 0, 1; 2, 1, 1), n \u2265 2\n\u223c\nTn = C(n, 1, a), (1 + a + a2 ) mod n = 0, or\nTn \u223c\n= C(3p, 1, a), (1 + a + a2 ) mod 3p = 0; n = 3p\n\u03a3(60) \u223c\n= A5\n\u03a3(60) \u00d7 Z3\n\u03a3(168) \u223c\n= P SL(2, 7)\n\u03a3(168) \u00d7 Z3\n\u03a3(36 \u00d7 3)\n\u03a3(72 \u00d7 3)\n\u03a3(216 \u00d7 3)\n\u03a3(360 \u00d7 3)\n\nOrder\nmn\nno general formula\nno general formula\nno general formula\n3n2\n6n2\n3n\n3n = 9p\n60\n180\n168\n504\n108\n216\n648\n1080\n\nReferences\n[6,\n[3,\n[3,\n[1,\n[1,\n[3,\n[3,\n[1,\n\n14]\n6]\n5, 6]\n3, 7,\n3, 7,\n7, 8,\n7, 8,\n3, 6,\n\n10]\n11]\n9]\n9]\n15, 16]\n\n[1, 3, 6, 15]\n[1,\n[1,\n[1,\n[1,\n\n3,\n3,\n3,\n3,\n\n6, 17, 18]\n6, 17, 18]\n6, 17, 18]\n6]\n\nTable 1: Types of finite subgroups of SU(3) [1, 6, 8, 9].

In the following we will show that there is at least one SU(3)-subgroup of type\n(D), which cannot be interpreted as an irreducible representation of some \u2206(6n2 ). In [12]\nthe following (D)-group has been found:\nD(9, 1, 1; 2, 1, 1) \u223c\n= \u301a162, 14\u301b,\n9\n\n\fwhich is of order 162. Since C(9, 1, 1) is invariant under the action of the Z2 -generator\nG, we find\nD(9, 1, 1; 2, 1, 1) \u223c\n= (Z9 \u00d7 Z3 ) \u22ca S3 .\n= ((Z9 \u00d7 Z3 ) \u22ca Z3 ) \u22ca Z2 \u223c\n= C(9, 1, 1) \u22cahhGii \u223c\n| {z }\n\n(39)\n\nA\u22cahhEii\n\nEquation (39) suggests that there might be an irreducible three-dimensional representation D of \u2206(6n2 ) \u223c\n= (Zn \u00d7 Zn ) \u22ca S3 such that D(\u2206(6n2 )) \u223c\n= D(9, 1, 1; 2, 1, 1). However,\nthis is not the case, which we will show in the following.\nIf we can show, that there is no three-dimensional irreducible representation D of \u2206(6n2 )\nwith ord(D(\u2206(6n2 ))) = 162, we have found an example for a (D)-group that cannot be\ninterpreted as an irreducible representation of some \u2206(6n2 ). This is indeed possible:\n4.1 Proposition. Let D be a three-dimensional irreducible representation of \u2206(6n2 ),\nthen\n\u2203 m \u2208 {1, ..., n} : D(\u2206(6n2 )) \u223c\n(40)\n= \u2206(6m2 ).\nThe proof of this proposition can be found in appendix C. Since 162/6 = 27 is not a square\nnumber, we have proven that D(9, 1, 1; 2, 1, 1) cannot be interpreted as an irreducible\nrepresentation of some \u2206(6n2 ).\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this work we tried to shine some light onto the hitherto not very well known series (C)\nand (D) of finite subgroups of SU(3). We were able to show that\nC(n, a, b) \u223c\n= (Zm \u00d7 Zp ) \u22ca Z3\nand we gave a method for the determination of m and p from the parameters n, a, b. We\ncould also give a simple example for a (C)-group which is neither of the form \u2206(3n2 ) nor\nof the form Tn , thus showing that (C) contains some hitherto unclassified subgroups of\nSU(3).\nFor the SU(3)-subgroups of type (D) we could determine the structure\nD(n, a, b; d, r, s) \u223c\n= (Zp \u00d7 Zq ) \u22ca S3 ,\nwhere p and q are functions of n, a, b, d, r, s. Since every (D)-group is a subgroup of some\n\u2206(6m2 ) \u223c\n= (Zm \u00d7 Zm )\u22caS3 it is tempting to assume that the (D)-groups can be interpreted\nas irreducible representations of \u2206(6m2 ). However, by giving a counterexample, we could\nshow that this is not the case in general.\nWe hope that the analysis given here can lead us a small step closer towards the goal\nof the classification of all finite subgroups of SU(3). Furthermore we hope that some of\nthe \"new\" types of finite subgroups of SU(3) discovered in this work can be useful for\napplication in particle physics.\n\n10\n\n\fAcknowledgment\nThe author wants to thank Roman Zwicky and Thomas Fischbacher for fruitful discussions and the University of Southampton, where the idea for this paper was born, for its\nhospitality.

Since G is an Abelian group of 3 \u00d7 3-matrices, we can choose a basis in which all\ngroup elements are diagonal.

Then the group hhag ii is a nontrivial\ncyclic group. Let now b be an element of G of order m. Since ord(ag ) and m have no\ncommon divisor larger than 1 we find:\nhhag ii \u2229 hhbii = {13 }.\n\u21d2 ord(|{z}\nag b ) = ord(ag ) ord(b) =\n\u2208G\n\nDefining\n\n(45)\n\nord(a)\n\u00d7m > m \u21d2 contradiction to (43).\ngcd(ord(a), m)\n|\n{z\n}\n>1\n\n\u03bc := exp(2\u03c0i/m),\nevery element of G has the form\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u03bcc 0\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n0 \uf8f8,\n\uf8ed 0 \u03bcd\n0 0 \u03bc\u2212c\u2212d\n\nc, d \u2208 {0, ..., m \u2212 1}.\n\n11\n\n(46)\n\n(47)\n\n\fThus G is a subgroup of\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n** \u03bc 0 0\n1 0 0 ++\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\u223c\n= Zm \u00d7 Zm .\n\uf8ed 0 1 0 \uf8f8 , \uf8ed0 \u03bc 0 \uf8f8\n\u2217\n\u2217\n0 0 \u03bc\n0 0 \u03bc\n\nLet\n\nk\n\nm = pk11 pk22 * * * pj j\n\n(48)\n\nbe the prime factorization of m (p1 , . . . , pj are the distinct prime factors of m). Then\nevery Abelian group of order m is the direct product of j Abelian groups Ai of order pki i\n(see e.g. theorem 3.3.1 of [20]). Since every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic (see e.g.\ntheorem 3.1.1 of [20]), in the case of Zm all Ai are cyclic and we find\n\nZm \u223c\n= Zpk1 \u00d7 Zpk2 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Zpkj ,\n1\n\nand thus\n\n2\n\n(49)\n\nj\n\nZm \u00d7 Zm \u223c\n= (Zpk1 \u00d7 Zpk1 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 (Zpkj \u00d7 Zpkj ).\n1\n\n1\n\nj\n\n(50)\n\nj\n\nNext we use the fact that if p is prime, every subgroup of Zpe1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Zpes is of the form\nZpf1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Zpfs with 0 \u2264 fi \u2264 ei (for a proof of this statement see e.g. theorem 3.3.3\nof [20]). Consequently, every subgroup G of Zm \u00d7 Zm has the form\nG\u223c\n= (Zpr11 \u00d7 Zpn1 1 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 (Zprj \u00d7 Zpnj ) \u223c\n= Zr \u00d7 Zn ,\nj\n\nj\n\n(51)\n\nQ r\nQ n\nwhere 0 \u2264 ni \u2264 ri \u2264 ki and r := j pj j , n := j pj j . Without loss of generality we have\nassumed ni \u2264 ri , which implies 1 \u2264 n \u2264 r \u2264 m.\nZm is a subgroup of G, because by definition (43) there exists at least one element of\norder m in G. Therefore-from equation (51)-we conclude r = m.
