Especially, in the context of\ndS/CFT proposal [1, 2, 3, 4] 2 , there have been increasing interests [5] in statistical computation\nof the Bekenstein-Hawking (BH) entropy for the three-dimensional Kerr-de Sitter (KdS3 ) space\n[6]\nS=\n\n2\u03c0r+\n,\n4h\u0304G\n\n(1)\n\nfrom the \"classical\" Virasoro algebra, associated with an asymptotic isometry group at the\ninfinite boundary \u00e0 la Strominger and Birmingham [7]. Here, r+ is the radius of the cosmological\nhorizon. But, there have been two problems in those analyses. The first is a conceptual problem\nthat the entropy was computed at the infinite boundary which is casually disconnected from\nthe observer who is sitting in our universe, the interior (r < r+ ) of the cosmological horizon.\nThe second is that the analyses were based on a plausible but unproven assumption about the\nextended Cardy's formula [8] for the complex central charge and conformal weight. (See [9] and\n[10] for recent strugglings with this problem.)\nIn this paper I consider the entropy in the context of Carlip's \"would-be gauge\" degrees\nof freedom approach [11] instead and show that the above two problems are resolved. The\nuse is made of SL(2, C) WZW theory on the horizon and its associated well-defined Virasoro\noperator. The obtained entropy agrees with the BH entropy (1) but there are no the problems\nabove. Implications to the dS/CFT are noted also.\nThe (2+1)-dimensional gravity for a cosmological constant \u039b = 1/l2 is described by the\naction\nIg =\n\n1\n16\u03c0G\n\nZ\n\n\u0013\n\u221a \u0012\n2\nd3 x \u2212g R \u2212 2 + Im ,\nl\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Im is the matter action [the details are not important in this paper] and I have omitted\nthe surface terms in the pure gravity part.

The interior\nand exterior regions are casually disconnected and the horizon acquires the thermodynamic entropy (1). I seek a statistical derivation of (1) in the context of the (2+1)-dimensional quantum\ngravity with would-be gauge degrees of freedom \"on the horizon\", \u00e0 la Carlip [11].\nThe quantization of (2) is best achieved by recasting the theory as a SL(2, C) Chern-Simons\ngauge theory [14, 15].

From this, the polar components are obtained as\nA\u03c1 = t1 , A\u03c6 = \u2212iz (U \u22121 t2 U), At = iA\u03c6 ,\n\n(11)\n\n!\n\n(12)\n\nwhere\nz = (r+ + ir(\u2212) )/l, U =\n\ne\u03c1/2\n0\n0 e\u2212\u03c1/2\n\n.\n\nThis insures that there is asymptotic isometries as \u03c1 \u2192 \u221e and its associated ( two-copies of\n) \"classical\" Virasoro algebra [1]. The obtained statistical entropy coincides with (1), which\nmeans that the appropriate CFT which gives the correct entropy of a horizon would live at\nthe infinite boundary, as coincides exactly with Strominger's dS/CFT proposal [4]. But, in\nthe following, I will show that (11) also allows to acquire the BH entropy (1) from a quantum\nmechanical analysis of SL(2, C) WZW conformal field theory on the horizon r+ which is located\nat the space boundary \u2202D2 , by a direct adaptation of Carlip's analysis [11].\nTo this end, I first note that the gauge connection (11) satisfies the boundary conditions\nfor a black hole horizon r+ , even if r(\u2212) is an arbitrary real parameter, r\u0303(\u2212) [16].

However,\nfor the horizon boundaries, where the lapse function\u2013the Lagrange multiplier for H\u2013vanishes, H\nis not constrained to be zero. Moreover, from the constancy of the (angular) shift function\u2013the\nmultiplier for H\u03c6 \u2013along \u03c6, only L0 + L\u03040 = 0, which does not depends on \u03c6, can be implemented\n[11, 16].\nFrom the remnant of the (quantum) constraint equation L0 + L\u03040 = 0, which corresponds to\nthe Wheeler-de Witt equation [11], on the horizon \u2202D2 = r+ , one obtains as\nh\u03042\ns2 2\n2\nN = 2 2 r+ \u2212 4l 1 + 2\n4s\nh\u0304 l\n\n!\u22121 \u0012\n\n2s\nr\u0303(\u2212) \u2212 r+\nh\u0304\n\n\u00132\n\n.\n\n(24)\n\nUp to now, the real parameter r\u0303(\u2212) is arbitrary and so we should sum over its possible values\nto count the number of macroscopically indistinguishable states. However,\nin order to compute\nq\nthe dominant contribution of N to the number of states \u03a9 \u2248 exp(2\u03c0 cN/6) [8, 23], it is enough\nto know its maximum value Nmax , which is attained as\nNmax\n\ns2 2\n2r+\n= 2 2 r+\n=\nh\u0304\nh\u0304 l\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\n(25)\n\nfor r\u0303(\u2212) = (2s/h\u0304)r+ , in our convention (9). In the semiclassical regime of large s, i.e., small \u039b,\nthe central charge may be approximated by that of six-three (a = 1, 2, 3) for each Kac-Moody\nsector and there are two Kac-Moody sectors with the currents Jna , J \u0304na -independent bosonic\noscillators such that c \u2248 6 [11, 24]. Then the dominant contrbution to the statistical entropy,\nthrough the Cardy's formula [8, 23, 24] for the asymptotic density of states of a conformal field\ntheory, is\nSst = ln \u03a9 \u2248 2\u03c0\n\ns\n\ncNmax\n4\u03c0r+\n=\n.\n6\nh\u0304\n\n(26)\n\nThis agrees completely with the thermodynamic entropy (1), after recovering the Newton's\nconstant G. Here note that the correct 1/h\u0304 factor, whose origin has not been explicit in the\nliteratures (see [16] for a comparison), comes from the definition (17), essentially. (26) is the\nsame result as in the negative \u039b, i.e., BTZ black hole case [16], which can be recaptured by\nl \u2192 il, s \u2192 is, r\u0303(\u2212) \u2192 ir\u0303\u2212 : The crucial point is that (24) is invariant under this substitution,\n6\n\n\fneglecting the sign change of (1\u2212h\u03042 /4s2 )\u22121 which is not important in the computation of Nmax ;\na similar analysis for the de-Sitter vacuum (M = 1, J = 0) has been studied by Strominger and\nMaldacena [25] several years ago in the context of Carlip's boundary conditions [11], but this\nproperty has not been evident in their approach.\nTo conclude, two remarks are in order.\nFirst, unlike the analyses of the asymptotic isometries [1], the Cardy's formula (26) is well\ndefined with the real valued c and Nmax . It is essential to restrict to the horizon in order to\nacquire the correct BH entropy.4\nSecond, note that maximum value of N comes from the Q term essentially which is purely\n2\n2\nquantum effect.5 Without that term, there is no r+\n\u2212 r\u0303(\u2212)\nterm in (21) such that there are\nno extremal points of N which satisfies L0 + L\u03040 = 0; rather, it increases indefinitely as N =\n(s/2h\u0304)r+ r\u0303(\u2212) /l2 which has no saddle points so that the Cardy's formula (26) can not be applied.\nThis is sharply contrast to the analysis of the asymptotic isometries of (11), where the \"classical\"\ncentral charges in the ( two-copies of ) Virasoro algebra has been crucial to obtain the correct\nBH entropy and additional quantum corrections gives only some small corrections to (1) [28].\nHence, I have two dual descriptions of black hole/cosmological horizons. One is described by\nthe two-copies of classical Virasoro algebra at the infinite boundary and the other's by one-copy\nof the quantum Virasoro generator through the Sugawara construction at the horizon r+ . By\ncombining the Strominger's dS/CFT proposal and the horizon holography [31] one can expect\nthat the two descriptions would be closely related. It would be an outstanding challenge to find\na direct connection, or a RG-flow, of these two dual descriptions.6 This will shed some light on\nthe mystery of dS/CFT correspondence.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the Korean Research Foundation Grant funded by Korea\nGovernment(MOEHRD) (KRF-2007-359-C00011).\n\nReferences\n[1] M.-I.
