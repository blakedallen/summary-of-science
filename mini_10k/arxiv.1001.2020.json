In this paper, we study 2-representations of 2-quantum groups\n(in the sense of Rouquier and Khovanov-Lauda) categorifying tensor products of irreducible representations. Our aim is to construct knot homologies\ncategorifying Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants of knots for arbitrary representations, which will be done in a follow-up paper.\nWe consider an algebraic construction of these categories, via an explicit diagrammatic presentation, generalizing the cyclotomic quotient of the quiver\nHecke algebra. When the Lie algebra under consideration is sln , we show\nthat these categories agree with certain subcategories of parabolic category\nO for glk .\nWe also investigate finer structure of these categories. Like many similar\nrepresentation-theoretic categories, they are standardly stratified and satisfy\na double centralizer property with respect to their self-dual modules. The\nstandard modules of the stratification play an important role, as Vermas do\nin more classical representation theory, as test objects for functors.\nThe existence of these representations has consequences for the structure of previously studied categorifications; it allows us to prove the nondegeneracy of Khovanov and Lauda's 2-category (that its Hom spaces have\nthe expected dimension) in all symmetrizable types, and that the cyclotomic\nquiver Hecke algebras are symmetric Frobenius.\n\nThe program of \"higher representation theory,\" begun (at least as an explicit\nprogram) by Chuang and Rouquier in [CR08] and continued by Rouquier [Rou]\nand Khovanov-Lauda [KL10] is aimed at studying \"2-analogues\" of the universal\nenveloping algebras of simple Lie algebras U(g), and their quantizations Uq (g). In\nthis paper, we study certain representations of these analogues. Our objects of study\nare certain explicitly given categories which are categorifications of tensor products\nof simple integrable modules for Uq (g) (in the sense that their Grothendieck groups\nare integral forms of these representations). Our interest in these categories has\narisen because of their applicability to the construction of knot invariants, which\nwe address in a sequel to this paper [Webc]; however, we believe they are also of\nindependent interest.\n1\n\nSupported by an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship and by the NSA under Grant H9823010-1-0199.\n1\n\n\fKnot invariants and higher representation theory I\nThese algebras also have connections in the type A case to classical representation\ntheory, as has been explored by Brundan and Kleshchev [BK09]. We will build on\ntheir work in Section 4 by showing that our categories appear in the context of\ncategory O in type A. For a general g, our categories should be viewed as a generalization of the type A category O orthogonal to that of category O for other groups,\njust as quiver varieties are a generalization of the type A flag variety orthogonal to\nthe flag varieties of other types.\nOur primary construction of these categories is algebraic; the underlying category\n\u03bb\nV is the representations of an algebra T\u03bb defined in this paper. The algebra T\u03bb is\na generalization of the cyclotomic quiver Hecke algebra introduced by Khovanov\nand Lauda. This categorification is well defined for any symmetrizable Kac-Moody\nalgebra, and it depends on a choice of base field k and polynomial Qij \u2208 k[u, v] for\nall i, j in the Dynkin diagram. Our main theorem is as follows:\nTheorem A The category V\u03bb is a categorification in the sense of Khovanov-Lauda,\nthat is, it carries an action of the 2-category U defined in [CL, \u00a72] and its Grothendieck\ngroup is canonically isomorphic to the tensor product\nV\u03bb \u001b V\u03bb1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 V\u03bbl .\nWe should note that here, and throughout the paper, \"2-category\" is meant in the\nstrict sense, not that of bicategories, so associativity laws hold \"on the nose.\"\nIn the case where g is finite-type and simply-laced, we can strengthen this theorem\nto show in [Weba, 6.11] that the indecomposable projectives in this category give\nLusztig's canonical basis of a tensor product.\nWe should note that even in the case of \u03bb = (\u03bb), where the algebra T\u03bb is a\ncyclotomic quotient in the sense of [KL10, \u00a73.4], this is a new theorem, which in\nparticular implies that the induction and restriction functors on these categories\nare biadjoint. This was proved independently by Kang and Kashiwara [KK] by\ncompletely different methods.\nWe show that these categories have many properties that would be expected by\nanalogy with similar representation-theoretic categories:\nTheorem B The projectives-injective objects of V\u03bb form a categorification of the\nsubrepresentation V\u03bb1 +***+\u03bbn \u2282 V\u03bb . In particular, if \u03bb = (\u03bb), then all projectives are\ninjective; in fact, the algebra T(\u03bb) is Frobenius.\nThe sum of all indecomposable projective-injectives has the double centralizer\nproperty; this realizes T\u03bb as the endomorphisms of a natural collection of modules\nover the algebra for the corresponding simple module T(\u03bb1 +***+\u03bbn ) .\nThe algebra T\u03bb is standardly stratified; the semi-orthogonal decomposition for\nthis stratification categorifies the decomposition of V\u03bb as the sum of tensor products\nof weight spaces.\n2\n\n\fBen Webster\nThis double centralizer result allows us to generalize a theorem of Brundan and\nKleshchev [BK09, Main Theorem], and show that in type A, the algebras T\u03bb are\nendomorphism algebras of certain projectives in parabolic category O, while in type\nb they are related to the representations of the cyclotomic q-Schur algebra. This\nA,\nrelationship will be explored more fully in work of the author and Stroppel [SW].\nWe see no reason to think that our category has a similar description in terms of\nclassical representation theory when g \u001d sln , b\nsln , though we would be quite pleased\nto be proven wrong in this speculation.\nThe action on these categories plays a similar role to the actions of equivariant\ncohomology studied by Lauda in [Lau10, Lau] and Khovanov-Lauda in [KL10]; it\nshows by direct construction that the set of diagrams conjectured by Khovanov\nand Lauda to give a basis of 2-morphisms indeed does (because there is no linear\ncombination of them that acts trivially on all categories V\u03bb ).\nTheorem C The 2-category U is nondegenerate (in the sense of [KL10, Definition\n3.15]) over any field.\nLet us now summarize the structure of the paper.\n\u2022 In Section 1, we discuss the basics of the 2-category U, and prove it acts on\nV\u03bb . This is accomplished by the construction of categorifications Ui\u2212 for the\nminimal non-solvable parabolics U(pi ). These categories carry a mixture of\nthe characteristics of U(b) and U(sl2 ); an appropriate non-degeneracy result\nis already known for both of these algebras separately. By modifying the\nproofs of these previous results, we can show that Ui\u2212 acts on V\u03bb . It is an\neasy consequence of this that the full U acts, which proves Theorem C.\n\u2022 In Section 2, we define the algebras T\u03bb . As far as we know, these algebras are\nnew to the literature, but are constructed using the familiar tool of KhovanovLauda's graphical calculus. This graphical calculus gives an easy description\nof the action of the category U. We also study the relationship of this category\nto T(\u03bb1 +***+\u03bbl ) .\n\u2022 In Section 3, we develop a special class of modules which we term standard\nmodules, which categorify pure tensors. These are typically not the standard\nmodules of a quasi-hereditary structure, but rather of a weaker standardly\nstratified structure. Amongst other things, these modules will prove crucial\nas \"test\" objects for understanding how functors decategorify.\n\u2022 In Section 4, we consider the case g = sln or b\nsln . In this case, we employ results\nof Brundan and Kleshchev to show that T\u03bb is in fact the endomorphism\nalgebra of a projective in a parabolic category O in finite type and in the\nrepresentation category of the cyclotomic q-Schur algebra in affine type. This\n3\n\n\fKnot invariants and higher representation theory I\nresult will be important for comparing our construction of knot homology in\nthe sequel to versions previously defined using category O.\n\nWe should note that an earlier version of this paper contained a section on the\nconnection between the algebraic material in this paper to the geometry of quiver\nvarieties. In the interest of length and heaviness of machinery, that material has\nbeen moved to other papers [Webb, Webe].\nNotation.

The careful reader should note that this is opposite to the\ngrading convention of Khovanov and Lauda.\nAcknowledgments.

Categorification of quantum groups\n1.1. 2-Categories. Let me re-emphasize that in this paper, unless specified otherwise, \"2-category\" will mean a strict 2-category, not a weak one or bicategory.\nIn this paper, our notation builds on that of Khovanov and Lauda, who give a\ngraphical version of the 2-quantum group, which we denote U (leaving g understood). These constructions could also be rephrased in terms of Rouquier's description and we have striven to make the paper readable following either [KL10] or\n[Rou]; however, it is most sensible for us to follow the 2-category defined by Cautis\nand Lauda [CL], which is a variation on both of these. The difference between this\ncategory and the categories defined by Rouquier in [Rou] is quite subtle\u2013it concerns\nprecisely whether the inverse to a particular map is formally added, or imposed to\nbe a particular composition of other generators in the category. Most important for\nour purposes, the 2-category U receives a canonical map from each of Rouquier's\n5\n\n\fKnot invariants and higher representation theory I\ncategories A and A\u2032 , so a representation of it is a representation in Rouquier's sense\nas well. Furthermore, Cautis and Lauda have shown that any representation in\nRouquier's sense satisfying very mild technical conditions will be a representation\nof U.\nSince the construction of these categories is rather complex, we give a somewhat\nabbreviated description. The most important points are these:\n\u2022 an object of this category is a weight \u03bb \u2208 Y.\n\u2022 a 1-morphism \u03bb \u2192 \u03bc is a formal sum of words in the symbols Ei and Fi where\ni ranges over \u0393 of weight \u03bb \u2212 \u03bc, Ei and Fi having weights \u00b1\u03b1i . In [Rou], the\ncorresponding 1-morphisms are denoted Ei , Fi , but we use these for elements\nof Uq (g). Composition is simply concatenation of words. In fact, we will take\nidempotent completion, and thus add a new 1-morphism for every projection\nfrom a 1-morphism to itself (once we have added 2-morphisms).\nBy convention, Fi = Fin * * * Fi1 if i = (i1 , . . . , in ) (this somewhat dyslexic\nconvention is designed to match previous work on cyclotomic quotients by\nKhovanov-Lauda and others). In Khovanov and Lauda's graphical calculus,\nthis 1-morphism is represented by a sequence of dots on a horizontal line\nlabeled with the sequence i.\nWe should warn the reader, this convention requires us to read our diagrams differently from the conventions of [Lau10, KL10, CL]; in our diagrammatic calculus, 1-morphisms point from the left to the right, not from\nthe right to the left as indicated in [Lau10, \u00a74]. Technically, the 2-category\nU we define is the 1-morphism dual of Cautis and Lauda's 2-category: the\nobjects are the same, but the 1-morphisms are all reversed. The practical\nimplication will be that our relations are the reflection through a vertical line\nof Cautis and Lauda's (without changing the labeling of regions).\n\u2022 2-morphisms are a certain quotient of the k-span of certain immersed oriented 1-manifolds carrying an arbitrary number of dots whose boundary is\ngiven by the domain sequence on the line y = 1 and the target sequence\non y = 0. We require that any component begin and end at like-colored\nelements of the 2 sequences, and that they be oriented upward at an Ei and\ndownward at an Fi . We will describe their relations momentarily. We require\nthat these 1-manifolds satisfy the same genericity assumptions as projections\nof tangles (no triple points or tangencies), but intersections are not over- or\nunder-crossings; our diagrams are genuinely planar. We consider these up\nto isotopy which preserves this genericity.\nWe draw these 2-morphisms in the style of Khovanov-Lauda, by labeling\nthe regions of the plane by the weights (objects) that the 1-morphisms are\nacting on.\nBy Morse theory, we can see that these are generated by\n6\n\n\fBen Webster\n\u2217 a cup \u01eb : Ei Fi \u2192 \u2205 or \u01eb\u2032 : Fi Ei \u2192 \u2205\n\u01eb=\n\n\u03bb\n\ni\n\ni\n\n\u03bb\n\ni\n\n\u2032\n\n\u01eb =\n\n\u03bb \u2212 \u03b1i\n\n\u03bb + \u03b1i\n\n\u2217 a cap \u03b9\u2032 : \u2205 \u2192 Ei Fi or \u03b9 : \u2205 \u2192 Fi Ei\n\u03bb\n\n\u03b9\u2032 =\n\ni\n\n\u03bb \u2212 \u03b1i\n\ni\n\n\u03bb\n\n\u03b9=\n\ni\n\ni\n\n\u03bb + \u03b1i\n\ni\n\n\u2217 a crossing \u03c8 : Fi F j \u2192 F j Fi\nj \u03bb\n\ni\n\ni\n\nj\n\n\u03c8=\n\n\u2217 a dot y : Fi \u2192 Fi\n\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\ni\n\ny=\ni\n\u03bb\n\nOnce and for all, fix a matrix of polynomials Qij (u, v) for i , j \u2208 \u0393 (by convention\nQii = 0) valued in k. We assume each polynomial is homogeneous of degree\nh\u03b1i , \u03b1 j i = \u22122d j cij = \u22122di c ji when u is given degree 2di and v degree 2d j. We will\nalways assume that the leading order of Qij in u is \u2212c ji , and that Qij (u, v) = Q ji (v, u).\nWe let tij = Qij (1, 0); by convention tii = 1. In order to match with [CL], we take\nX\npq\n\u2212c ji\n\u2212ci j\nQij (u, v) = tij u + tij v +\nsij up vq .\nqc ji +pci j =c ji ci j\n\nKhovanov and Lauda's original category is the choice Qij = u\u2212c ji + v\u2212ci j .\nBefore writing the relations, let us remind the reader that these 2-morphism spaces\nare actually graded; the degrees are given by\ndeg\ni\n\nj\n\n= \u2212h\u03b1i , \u03b1 j i\n\ndeg\ni\n\n= h\u03b1i , \u03b1i i\n\ndeg\ni\n\n\u03bb\ndeg i\n= \u2212h\u03bb, \u03b1i i \u2212 di\n= \u2212h\u03bb, \u03b1i i \u2212 di\ndeg\n\ni\n\nj\n\n= \u2212h\u03b1i , \u03b1 j i\n\n\u03bb\ndeg i = h\u03bb, \u03b1i i \u2212 di\ndeg\n= h\u03bb, \u03b1i i \u2212 di .\n\n\u03bb\n\ni\n\n\u03bb\n\nThe relations satisfied by the 2-morphisms include:\n7\n\ndeg\ni\n\n= h\u03b1i , \u03b1i i\n\n\fKnot invariants and higher representation theory I\n\u2022 the cups and caps are the units and counits of a biadjunction.

We\nmust add formal symbols called \"fake bubbles\" which are bubbles labelled\nwith a negative number of dots (these are explained in [KL10, \u00a73.1.1]); given\nthese, we have the inversion formula for bubbles, shown in Figure 1.\ni\nj+\u03bb\nX+1\n\nk=\u03bbi \u22121\n\nj\u2212k\n\nk\n\n\u03bb\n\n=\n\n(\n\n1\n0\n\nj = \u22122\nj > \u22122\n\nFigure 1.

For our purposes, it will be crucial to have a\nnondegeneracy result for U; the most important consequence of this will be that the\nquiver Hecke algebra injects into EndU (\u2295i Fi \u03bc) for any weight \u03bc. Luckily, we know\nsuch results for sl2 , and for the Borel b\u2212 by work of Lauda [Lau10] and KhovanovLauda [KL09], with independent proofs given by Rouquier [Rou, Proposition 5.15\n& Proposition 3.12]. Since a Kac-Moody algebra is essentially a bunch of sl2 's with\ntheir interactions described by a Borel, we can hope that these cases can lead us to\nthe more general case.\nLet us first give a rough sketch of the argument:\n\u2022 First, we construct an auxilliary 2-category which corresponds to a categorification of a minimal parabolic b\u2212 + C * Ei . This category contains a\ncopy of Lauda's categorification of sl2 and of Ui . A variant of Lauda's nondegeneracy argument works for this category.\n\u2022 We can use this non-degeneracy argument to show that the projective modules over the cyclotomic quotient are a quotient of an obvious 2-representation\nof this category, and thus also carry an action of it. This establishes that Ei\nand Fi define an action of Usl2 ; in particular, these functors are biadjoint.\n\u2022 We then need only check one extra relation to confirm that we have an action\nof all U on the projective modules over the cyclotomic quotient; this action\ncan be used to confirm non-degeneracy for the whole of U.\n\nIn order to follow though on this argument, we consider a new category categorifying the parabolic generated by b\u2212 and Ei , for a fixed index i (which we leave fixed\nfor the remainder of this section).\nDefinition 1.1 We let Ui\u2212 be the 2-category whose\n\n\u2022 objects are weights of g,\n\u2022 1-morphisms are compositions of 1-morphisms in U \u2212 and the single 1-morphism Ei from U + ,\n\u2022 2-morphisms are a quotient of the k-span of string diagrams of the form\nused in U in which only i-colored strands are allowed to go downwards.\nThe relations killed are exactly those from U that relate such diagrams.\n\nIn Rouquier's language, we would construct this category by adjoining Ei to the\nlower half categorification as a formal left adjoint to Fi , and impose the relations\nthat\n\u2022 the map \u03c1s,\u03bb is an isomorphism whose inverse is described by the lower\nrelation in Figure 2 (in the \"style\" of Rouquier, one would not impose this\nequation, but simply adjoin an inverse to \u03c1s,\u03bb ).\n\u2022 the right adjunction between Fi and Ei is given by the upper relation of Figure\n2.\n11\n\n\fKnot invariants and higher representation theory I\nThere a functor Ui\u2212 \u2192 U, which is not manifestly faithful, since new relations\ncould appear when the other objects are added. We note that the 2-morphisms in\nthis category have a spanning set given by the set Bi,j,\u03bb defined in [KL10, \u00a73.2.3] for\nthe morphisms allowed in Ui\u2212 , which we will denote Bi . Let us briefly recall this\ndefinition:\nDefinition 1.2 For any two 1-morphisms G and H given by words in the F j 's and\nEi 's, we let BG,H,i denote the set of 2-morphisms given by\n\u2022 for each perfect matching on the collection of all the glyphs in the words G\nand H which can only matches\n\u2013 an F j or Ei in G to one in H, or\n\u2013 an Fi to an Ei within the same word\nwe choose an arbitrary 2-morphism which connects the matched dots without any self-intersection or any strands intersecting twice. We fix an arbitrary\npoint on each strand in this 2-morphism\n\u2022 we let BG,H,i be the set obtained by multiplying these chosen 2-morphisms by\nan arbitrary monomial in the bubbles at the left and by an arbitrary number\nof dots at each of the fixed location on the strands.\nThe set Bi is union of these sets over all 1-morphisms G and H.\nJust as Lauda's categorification of sl2 acts on a \"flag category,\" this parabolic\ncategorification acts on a \"quiver flag category,\" which can be thought of as arising\nfrom Zheng's construction [Zhe] if one only quotients out by the thick subcategory\nfor the vertex i. While this geometric perspective can be made precise for symmetric\nKac-Moody algebras, we wish to give a proof for all symmetrizable types, and thus\nwill give a completely algebraic construction.\nj\nFor ease, we let m\u03bc = \u03c9\u2228j (\u03bb \u2212 \u03bc), where \u03c9\u2228i : X \u2192 Z is the linear function sending\n\u03b1i to 1, and all other simple roots to 0. As usual, we let \u039b(p) be the algebra of\nsymmetric polynomials on an alphabet p, and let ei (p), hi (p) denote the elementary\nand complete symmetric polynomials of degree i. Let\nO\n\u039b\u0303\u03bc \u001b\n\u039b(p j,1 , . . . , p j,m j ).\n\u03bc\n\nj\u2208\u0393\n\nNow consider the polynomial in \u039b\u0303\u03bc given by\nj\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\u221e\nm\u03bc\n\uf8f7\uf8f7 Y Y\n\uf8ec\uf8ecX\n\u2212c ji\nt\u22121\nQ ji (p j,k , \u2212t),\nhk (pi )(\u2212t)k \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\u039e\u03bc (p, t) = \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\nij * t\nk=0\n\nj,i k=0\n\nwhere pi denotes the alphabet of variables pi,\u2217 .\nWe let \u039b\u03bc be the quotient of \u039b\u0303\u03bc by the relations:\n\u039e\u03bc {tg } = 0\n\nj\n\nfor all g > \u03bci + m\u03bc\n12\n\n\fBen Webster\nHere f (t){tg } denotes the tg coefficient of a polynomial. We note that these are\nquite reminiscent of the relations in a Grassmannian Gr(n, m), which are simply that\nhk (p) = 0 for all k > n \u2212 m. In the symmetric case, for a specific choice of Qij , the\nring \u039b\u03bc is the cohomology ring of a Grassmannian bundle over a module space of\nquiver representations, and these constructions can be interpreted geometrically.\nDefinition 1.3 The \"quiver flag category\" G\u03bb is a 2-category that sends each weight\n\u03bc to the category of modules over \u039b\u03bc with 1-morphisms given by the categories of\nfunctors between \u039b\u03bc -mod isomorphic to tensoring with a bimodule between the corresponding algebras algebras, and 2-morphisms given by natural transformations\nisomorphic to bimodule morphisms.\nIt may seem rather strange to use \"functors isomorphic to tensoring with a bimodule\" here; the point is that this is a strict 2-category, whereas considering the\nbimodules themselves would be a weak one.\nTheorem 1.4 There is a strict 2-functor Ui\u2212 \u2192 G\u03bb , and every non-trivial linear\ncombination of elements of Bi in Ui\u2212 acts non-trivially in one of these categories.\nThat is, Ui\u2212 is non-degenerate in the sense of Khovanov-Lauda.\nProof. First, we describe the action on the level of 1-morphisms.\n\u2022 The functors F j for j , i act by tensoring with the \u039b\u03bc - \u039b\u03bc\u2212\u03b1i bimodule\n\u039b\u03bc [p j,m j +1 ]. The left-module structure over \u039b\u03bc is the obvious one, and right\u03bc\nmodule over \u039b\u03bc\u2212\u03b1 j is a slight tweak of this: ek (p\u2032j ) acts by ek (p j , p j,m j +1 ), ek (p\u2032m )\n\u03bc\nby ek (pm ) for m , j.\n\u2022 The functor Fi acts by an analogue of the action in Lauda's paper [Lau10];\ntensor product with a natural \u039b\u03bc - \u039b\u03bc\u2212\u03b1i -bimodule \u039b\u03bc;i which is a quotient of\n\u039b\u03bc [pi,mi\u03bc +1 ] by the relation\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb \u221e\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\uf8ecX\nj\nc\nfor all g > \u03bci + m\u03bc \u2212 1\n(1.1)\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed (\u2212pi,mi\u03bc +1 t) \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 \u039e\u03bc {tg } = 0\nc=0\n\nwith the same left and right actions as above.\n\u2022 Similarly, the functor Ei acts by tensor product with \u039b\u0307\u03bc+\u03b1i ;i , the bimodule\ndefined above with the actions above reversed. This can also be presented\nas a quotient of \u039b\u03bc [pi,mi\u03bc ] by the relation\n\u0010\n\u0011\nj\n1 + pi,mi\u03bc +1 t \u039e\u03bc {tg } = 0\nfor all g > \u03bci + m\u03bc .\n\nIf we only consider Ei 's and Fi 's, then we obtain a sum of specializations of Lauda's\nconstruction of a representation of Usl2 on the equivariant cohomology of Grassmanj\nnians. That is, for each fixed choice of m\u03bc for i , j, we realize the functors along the\n13\n\n\fKnot invariants and higher representation theory I\nP j\nsl2 weight-string of \u03b7 = \u03bb \u2212 m\u03bc \u03b1 j by extending scalars from Lauda's construction\n\u2217\nby the map HGL\n(Gr(mi\u03bc , \u221e); k) \u2192 \u039b given by sending\n\u221e\nxk 7\u2192 ek (pi )\n\nyk 7\u2192 \u039e\u03bc (t){tk }.\n\nClearly, we have\n\u2217\n\u039b\u03bc \u001b HGL\n(Gr(mi\u03bc , \u221e); k) \u2297H\u2217\n\u221e\n\nGL i\n\u03b7\n\n(Gr(mi\u03bc ,\u03b7i );k)\n\n\u039b.\n\nThis allows us to define all necessary 2-morphisms between Fi 's and Ei 's, which\nautomatically satisfy all the appropriate relations by [Lau, Theorem 4.13].\nOn the other hand, 2-morphisms between F j's other than i act as in Khovanov and\nLauda [KL11] or Rouquier [Rou, Proposition 3.12]. Similarly, the proof of relations\nfollows over immediately. Thus, the only issue is the interaction between these 2\nclasses of functors.\nIn particular, it remains to show the maps corresponding to elements of R(\u03bd) are\nwell defined (the relations between them then automatically hold, since quotienting\nout by relations will not cause two things to become unequal).\nNow, consider the bimodules \u039b\u03bc;i \u2297\u039b\u03bc\u2212\u03b1i \u039b\u03bc\u2212\u03b1i ; j and \u039b\u03bc; j \u2297\u039b\u03bc\u2212\u03b1 j \u039b\u03bc\u2212\u03b1 j ;i . The functors of\ntensor with these are canonically isomorphic to Fi F j and F j Fi , respectively (though\nthe are not the same \"on the nose\"), so it suffices to define the map \u03c8 as a map\nbetween these bimodules.

In this\ncase, the functor Fi corresponds to outer tensor with a polynomial ring, followed by\nmodding out the appropriate ideal, where morphisms in U \u2212 act on the polynomial\nring by the usual polynomial representation of the KLR algebra.\nNo linear combination in Bi acts trivially before modding out by this ideal. Furthermore, if \u03bb is sufficiently large, then we can assure that all relations in \u039b\u03bc are of\narbitrarily large degree, so any linear combination of diagrams in Bi can be killed\nfor all \u03bb by degree reasons.\n\u0003\n1.3. Cyclotomic quotients. Now that we understand how to add the adjoint of one\nof the Fi 's to U \u2212 , we move towards considering all of them. Just as with U \u2212 and\nUi\u2212 , we prove non-degeneracy by constructing a family of actions which are jointly\nfaithful. As in the previous section, i will denote a fixed element of \u0393, and we will\nuse j for an arbitrary index.\nDefinition 1.5 The cyclotomic quiver Hecke algebra R\u03bb for a weight \u03bb is the quoi\ntient of R by the cyclotomic ideal, the 2-sided ideal generated by the elements y\u03bb1 1 e(i)\nfor all sequences i.\nWe let V\u03bb denote the category of finite dimensional graded R\u03bb -modules.\nThis algebra has attracted great interest recently in the work of Brundan-Kleshchev\n[BK09], Kleshchev-Ram [KR11], Hoffnung-Lauda and Lauda-Vazirani [LV11, HL10],\nHill-Melvin-Mondragon [HMM] and Tingley and the author [TW]. It has a very rich\n16\n\n\fBen Webster\nstructure and representation theory, and some surprising connections to classical\nrepresentation theory. More importantly for our purposes, V\u03bb is a module category\nover U, as we will show below.\nConsider the map \u03bd j : R\u03bb\u03bc \u2192 R\u03bb\u03bc\u2212\u03b1i that adds a strand labeled with j at the right.\nDefinition 1.6 We let F j = \u2212 \u2297R\u03bb\u03bc R\u03bb\u03bc\u2212\u03b1i denote the functor of extension of scalars by\nthis map; we will refer to this as an induction functor.\nWe let E j = HomR\u03bb\u03bc\u2212\u03b1 (R\u03bb\u03bc , \u2212)(h\u03bc, \u03b1 j i \u2212 di ) denote restriction of scalars by this map\ni\n(with a grading shift), the functors left adjoint to the Fi 's; we call these restriction\nfunctors.\nIt's worth noting that these are graded differently from the most obvious restriction functors; the presence of a cup (see Figure 10) shifts the grading.\nThe first step to understanding this relation is to realize the cyclotomic quotient\nin terms of the category Ui\u2212 . Given any object \u03bb in the 2-category Ui\u2212 , we have\na representation Ui\u2212 (\u03bb) of this 2-category (i.e. a strict 2-functor to Cat), given by\n\u03bc 7\u2192 Hom(\u03bb, \u03bc) with 1-morphisms giving functors between these categories and\n2-morphisms natural transformations by composition. Given any collection J of\n2-morphisms closed under both vertical composition and horizontal composition\non the right with arbitrary morphisms (a \"ideal\" which is 2-sided for the vertical\ncomposition, and 1-sided for horizontal composition), we can consider the quotient\nrepresentation Ui\u2212 (\u03bb)/J by these 2-morphisms; this is again a 2-functor from Ui\u2212 to\nCat. It sends \u03bc to the quotient of Hom(\u03bb, \u03bc)/J, the category whose objects coincide\nwith those of Hom(\u03bb, \u03bc), but where all morphisms in J are identified with 0 (of\ncourse, if the identity morphism of an object is in J, that object is isomorphic to 0 in\nthe quotient category).\nProposition 1.7 Let J be the smallest set of morphisms containing\nid : Ei \u03bb \u2192 Ei \u03bb\n\nand\n\nj\n\ny\u03bb : F j \u03bb \u2192 F j \u03bb\n\nfor all j\n\nwhich is closed under both vertical composition and horizontal composition on the\nright with arbitrary morphisms. The idempotent completion of Ui\u2212 (\u03bb)/J is equivalent to the category of projective R\u03bb -modules, and this equivalence is intertwines\nthe functor Fi with Fi and the functor Ei with Ei .\nThat is, this equivalence induces a strict 2-functor Ui\u2212 \u2192 Cat given by\n\u03bc 7\u2192 R\u03bb\u03bc \u2212pmod\n\nF j 7\u2192 F j\n\nEi 7\u2192 Ei .\n\nIn particular, the functors Ei and Fi are biadjoint (up to grading shift) since Fi and\nEi are biadjoint in Ui\u2212 .\n17\n\n\fKnot invariants and higher representation theory I\n\u03bb\nProof. First, we\nlarger algebra\nL show that R can also be written as a quotient of the\nj\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nR\u0303 = EndUi\u2212 ( i Fi ), again by the 2-sided ideal generated by idA *y : AFi \u03bb \u2192 AF j \u03bb\nfor all 1-morphisms A; we call this ideal \"the cyclotomic ideal of R\u0303\u03bb .\" This ideal\ncontains all positive degree clockwise bubbles at the left of the diagram (since all of\nthese carry at least \u03bbi dots), so the quiver L\nHecke algebra surjects onto the quotient.\n\u2212\nOn the other hand, if a diagram in EndUi ( i Fi ) contains a positive degree bubble,\nit cannot be rewritten by the relations to be an element of the quiver Hecke algebra.\nThus, the intersection of the cyclotomic ideal in R\u0303\u03bb with the included copy of R is\nthe cyclotomic ideal of that smaller algebra.\nWe also note that in Ui\u2212 (\u03bb)/J, every object is a summand of one of the form \u2295i Fi \u03bb\nfor some set of i's. Since such objects generate under the action of Ui\u2212 (after all, \u03bb\nalone generates), it suffices to show such objects are closed under the action of Ei .\nWe induct on the length of i. If i = \u2205, then Ei \u03bb = 0 and we are done. In general, we\nhave that Ei Fin Fi\u2032 \u03bb is a summand of Fin Ei Fi\u2032 \u03bb plus some number of copies of Fi\u2032 \u03bb,\nby the relations in Figures 2 and 3 (this is discussed in more detail in [Lau10, \u00a75.7]).\nThus, by induction, we are done.\nCombining these results, we see that the statement of the theorem is equivalent\nto the statement that in Ui\u2212 (\u03bb)/J, the morphism space HomUi\u2212 /J (Fi , Fj ) is isomorphic\nto ei R\u03bb ej with composition sent to multiplication. We have a multiplicative map\nei R\u0303\u03bb ej \u2192 HomUi\u2212 /J (Fi , Fj), and this map sends the cyclotomic ideal to the indicated\nsubcategory, so it induces a map ei R\u03bb ej \u2192 HomUi\u2212 /J (Fi , Fj). If an element of R\u03bb is\nin the kernel of this map, its image in HomUi\u2212 (Fi , Fj) is in J. Since R\u03bb injects into\nHomUi\u2212 (Fi , Fj) by Theorem 1.4, this element can be rewritten as a sum of diagrams\nthat factor through AEi \u03bb for some 1-morphism A plus elements of the cyclotomic\nideal. We can assume without loss of generality that it is a sum of elements of the\nformer form.\nSaid differently, this 2-morphism can be obtained by starting with a 2-morphism\na : Fi Fi (\u03bb + \u03b1i ) \u2192 Fj Fi (\u03bb + \u03b1i ), and \"capping off\" the Fi . We rewrite a in terms of\nKhovanov and Lauda's spanning set, where we choose reduced expressions for our\npermutations so that the left-most simple reflection only happens once.\n\"Capping off,\" we obtain an element where every diagram appearing has either\na clockwise bubble at the far left, or a loop-de-loop turning leftward. We can apply\nthe relation of Figure 2 to see that it is a sum of elements in the cyclotomic ideal\nplus diagrams with a clockwise bubble at the left. By the relation of Figure 1, every\npositive degree clockwise bubble can be written as a a polynomial in positive degree\ncounter-clockwise bubbles. A positive degree counter-clockwise bubble must carry\nat least \u03bbi dots and thus lies in the cyclotomic ideal of R\u0303\u03bb .\nThis shows that Ui\u2212 acts on the category of projective modules of R\u03bb and clearly Fi\nis sent to Fi . Since Ei (h\u03bc, \u03b1i i \u2212 di ) (resp. Ei (\u2212h\u03bc, \u03b1i i + di )) is left (resp. right) biadjoint\n\n18\n\n\fBen Webster\nto Fi in Ui\u2212 (up to shift), Ei is sent to Ei by the uniqueness of left adjoints. This also\nshows that Ei (\u2212h\u03bc, \u03b1i i + di ) is right adjoint to Fi .\n\u0003\n\nIn particular, this shows that every inclusion U \u2212 \u0592\u2192 U \u2212j induces the same action\nof U \u2212 on V\u03bb .\nUsing these biadjunctions, we can interpret any picture of the type Khovanov and\nLauda draw where all strands begin and end pointing downward as an element\nof the cyclotomic quotient. We note that it is not immediately obvious that this\nassignment satisfies all of Cautis and Lauda's relations.\nStill, this equips R\u03bb with a map \u03c4\u03bb : R\u03bb \u2192 k given by closing a diagram at the right\n(if top and bottom strands match) and interpreting this as an element of R\u03bb (0) \u001b k,\nas shown in Figure 5. The biadjunction implies that this functional makes R\u03bb into a\nFrobenius algebra.\nRecall that a Frobenius structure on a k-algebra A is a linear map tr : A \u2192 k which\nkills no left ideal.\n***\n\n\u03bb\n\n***\n\nd\n***\n\nFigure 5. Closing a diagram\nTheorem 1.8 The assignment E j 7\u2192 E j , F j 7\u2192 F j gives a strict action of U on\nR\u03bb\u03bc \u2212pmod and thus on V\u03bb . Any non-trivial linear combination of Khovanov and\nLauda's spanning set acts non-trivially on some V\u03bb . In particular, the functors E j\nand F j are biadjoint and \u03c4\u03bb is a Frobenius structure on R\u03bb .\nAs a Uq (g)-representation, K0 (R\u03bb ) is naturally isomorphic to V\u03bbZ .\nWe should note that this theorem has been independently proven by Cautis and\nLauda [CL, 8.1] based on work of Kang and Kashiwara [KK].\nRemark 1.9 This Frobenius trace can be easily adjusted to become symmetric. One\nfixes one reference sequence i\u03bc for each weight \u03bc; for each other sequence i, we pick\na diagram connecting it to i\u03bc and for each crossing with and consider the scalar t(i)\nwhich is the product over all crossings in the diagram of t ji /tij where the NE/SW\nstrand of the crossing is labeled with i and the NW/SE strand is labeled j. If we\nmultiply the trace on e(i)R\u03bb e(i) by t(i), the result will still be Frobenius and be cyclic.\n19\n\n\fKnot invariants and higher representation theory I\n\nThe reader may sensibly ask why we use the trace above instead; it is in large\npart so we may match the conventions of [CL] and use their results. That said, their\nchoice arises very naturally from a coherent principle: that degree 0 bubbles should\nbe 1. Trying to recover cyclicity in U will definitely break this condition.\nProof of Theorem 1.8. We have already established that we have actions of the categorification of sl2 for each simple root and of U \u00b1 , so any relation only involving\nthese subcategories must be satisfied. In fact, we already know that any relation only\ninvolving one Ei is satisfied. This leaves exactly one from Khovanov and Lauda's\nrelations: fixing the double duals of morphisms.\nThis is actually equivalent to tr satisfying the condition that tr(ab) = tr(ba) if a is\na diagram only involving dots and crossings in one color (which we already know\nfrom the action of U\u2212i ) and tr(\u03c8 * a) = t ji /tij * tr(a * \u03c8) if \u03c8 is crossing with the NE/SW\nstrand labeled with i and the NW/SE strand labeled j, and the latter condition is\nsomewhat simpler to prove (primarily as a matter of organizing induction). We\nprove that \u03c4\u03bb is symmetric by induction on the number of strands, noting that we\nalready know that \u03c4\u03bb (ab) = \u03c4\u03bb (ba) if b is a diagram where all dots and crossing only\noccur in one color. This establishes the base case of one strand.\nWe can always use relations in a to assure that the strands at the far right at the top\nand bottom (if different) cross each other before any other strands. Thus, if b doesn't\ncross the rightmost strand, then we can collapse the loop formed when closing ab\nby crushing the rightmost bubble in a. We thus can obtain a diagram a\u2032 with fewer\nstrands such that if b\u2032 is b with the rightmost strand removed, then tr(ab) = tr(a\u2032 b\u2032 )\nand tr(ba) = tr(b\u2032 a\u2032 ). Thus, by induction, we have tr(ab) = tr(ba).\nThis reduces us to the case where b is a single crossing of the two rightmost\nstrands, which may assume are of a different color. This separates into 3 cases,\ngrouped by how many the 2 rightmost terminals at top are connected to the the 2\nrightmost terminals at the bottom; this is either 0, 1, or 2. Each of these individual\ncases is an easy calculation, which we show in Figure 6. This establishes that the\ncorrect duals hold, and thus that U acts on R\u03bb\u03bc -pmod.\nWe know that the functors E j and F j extend to all modules as do the natural\ntransformations defined by 2-morphisms in U. Since every object in V\u03bb has a\npresentation by projectives, it is enough to check relations between natural transformations on the subcategory of projectives. Thus, these functors also define an\naction of U on V\u03bb .\nTo show that any non-trivial linear combination of Khovanov and Lauda's spanning set acts non-trivially, it is enough to show that any polynomial in the dots acts\nnon-trivially for some \u03bb (since no element of R\u03bb kills the polynomial representation).\nThis, in turn, reduces to the case of a polynomial in positive degree bubbles (we can\n\n20\n\n\fBen Webster\n\nj\n\ni\n\nj\n\ni\n\nj\nj\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\nj\n\nj\n\ni\n\nFigure 6. Establishing the double dual of \u03c3ij . In each case, the proof\nof double dual is to \"pull\" the indicated strand in the direction of the\nthin dashed line.\n\n21\n\n\fKnot invariants and higher representation theory I\nsimply multiply our polynomial in dots by a monomial to assure that each bubble\nobtain upon closing is positive degree).\nConsider the highest degree monomial in the bubbles, and let \u03b1i be a simple root\nsuch that a positive degree bubble colored with \u03b1i appears in this term. Let j be the\nsum of the degrees of the i-colored bubbles in this term. Let k = max(1, 1 \u2212 \u03bci ), and\nsurround this polynomial in bubbles with k bubbles colored with i, with the outer\none carrying \u03bci \u2212 1 dots. This is a non-zero polynomial in bubbles with lower degree.\nBy induction, we get a non-zero polynomial of 0 degree, i.e. a scalar map id\u03bb\u2032 \u2192 id\u03bb\u2032\nfor some weight \u03bb\u2032 . Thus, we need only choose \u03bb such that the \u03bb\u2032 -weight space of\nV\u03bb is non-trivial.\nFinally, we must check that K0 (R\u03bb ) \u001b V\u03bb . For this, we need only note that\n\u2022 K0 (R\u03bb ) is generated by a single highest weight vector of weight \u03bb. Thus it is\na quotient of the Verma module of highest weight \u03bb.\n\u2022 On the other hand, V\u03bb is an integrable categorification in the sense of\nRouquier: acting by Fi or Ei a sufficiently large number of times kills any\nR\u03bb -module, so K0 (R\u03bb ) is integrable.\n\u2022 V\u03bbZ is the only integrable quotient of the the Verma module which is free as\na Z[q, q\u22121 ] module.\n\u0003\nSince no element of U\u0307 kills all finite dimensional representations, an immediate\nconsequence of this is that\nCorollary 1.10 The map \u03b3 : U\u0307 \u2192 K(U) defined by Khovanov and Lauda in [KL10,\n\u00a73.6] is an isomorphism.\nRecall that the q-Shapovalov form h\u2212, \u2212i is the unique bilinear form on V\u03bbZ such\nthat\n\u2022 hvh , vhi = 1 for a fixed highest weight vector vh .\n\u2022 hu * v, v\u2032i = hv, \u03c4(u) * v\u2032 i for any v, v\u2032 \u2208 V\u03bb and u \u2208 Uq (g), where \u03c4 is the\nq-antilinear antiautomorphism defined by\n\u03c4(Ei ) = q\u22121\n\u03c4(Fi ) = q\u22121\n\u03c4(K\u03bc ) = K\u2212\u03bc\ni K\u0303\u2212i Fi\ni K\u0303i Ei\n\u2022 f hv, v\u2032 i = h f \u0304v, v\u2032 i = hv, f v\u2032 i for any v, v\u2032 \u2208 V\u03bbZ and f \u2208 Z[q, q\u22121 ].\nCorollary 1.11 The isomorphism K0 (R\u03bb ) \u001b V\u03bbZ intertwines the Euler form\nh[P1 ], [P2 ]i = dimq Hom(P1 , P2 )\n\nwith the q-Shapovalov form described above. In particular,\ndimq e(i)R\u03bb e(j) = hFi vh , Fj vh i\nWe let h\u2212, \u2212i1 denote the specialization of this form at q = 1, which is thus the\nungraded Euler form.\n22\n\n\fBen Webster\n1.4. Universal categorifications. In [Rou, \u00a75.1.2], Rouquier discusses universal\ncategorifications of simple integrable modules. Of course, to speak of universality, we must have a notion of morphisms between categorical modules. Let\n\u05d01 , \u05d02 : U \u2192 Cat be two strict 2-functors.\nDefinition 1.12 A strongly equivariant functor \u03b2 is a collection of functors \u03b2(\u03bb) : \u05d01 (\u03bb) \u2192\n\u05d02 (\u03bb) together with natural isomorphisms of functors cu : \u03b2 \u25e6 \u05d01 (u) \u001b \u05d02 (u) \u25e6 \u03b2 for\nevery 1-morphism u \u2208 U such that\ncv \u25e6 (id\u03b2 \u2297 \u05d01 (\u03b1)) = (\u05d02 (\u03b1) \u2297 id\u03b2 ) \u25e6 cu\n\nfor every 2-morphism \u03b1 : u \u2192 v in U . (Here we use \u2297 for horizontal composition,\nand \u25e6 for vertical composition of 2-morphisms).\nIn [Rou, \u00a75.1.2], it is proven that there is a unique U-module category V\u030c\u03bb (he\nuses the notation L(\u03bb)) with generating highest weight object P with the universal\nproperty that\n(\u2217) for any additive, idempotent-complete U-module category C and any object\nC \u2208 Ob C\u03bb with Ei (C) = 0 for all i, there is a unique (up to unique isomorphism) strongly equivariant functor \u03c6C : V\u030c\u03bb \u2192 C sending P\u2205 to C.\nOn purely formal grounds, such a category must exist for any version of the 2category categorifying Uq (g); thus we will study the corresponding module for the\n2-category U we have been using, which is different from Rouquier's.\nIn any case, this is a higher categorical analogue of the universal property of a\nVerma module, but somewhat surprisingly, V\u030c\u03bb does not categorify a Verma module,\n\u0010but rather\u0011an integrable module. We recall that EndU (\u2295i Fi\u03bb) \u001b R \u2297 \u039b where \u039b \u001b\n\u2297 j\u2208\u0393 \u039b(p j ) and p j is an infinite alphabet attached to each node, with the clockwise\nbubble of degree 2n corresponding to (\u22121)n en (p j ), and the counterclockwise one of\ndegree 2n corresponding to hn (pi ).\nDefinition 1.13 Let \u0158\u03bb be the quotient of EndU (\u2295i Fi \u03bb) by the relations\n\u2212\u03bb j\n\nj\n\n... =\n\n\u2212\nj\n\nj\n\n\u2212\u03bb j\n\n\u2212\u03bb j\n\n... +\n\n\u03bbj\n\nj\n\nj\n\n\u22121\n\n... + ...\n\n\u03bbj \u2212 1\n\nj\n\n23\n\n... =\n\n+\nj\n\nn\n\n... = 0\n\nj\n\n(n \u2265 0)\n\n0\n\n\fKnot invariants and higher representation theory I\n\nwhere in both pictures, the ellipses indicate that the portion of the diagram shown\nis at the far left.

The idempotent completion\nof the quotient U(\u03bb)/J\u2032 is equivalent to the category \u0158\u03bb -pmod.\nCorollary 1.15 For any additive, idempotent-complete U -module category C and\nany object C \u2208 Ob C\u03bb with Ei (C) = 0 for all i, there is a unique strongly equivariant\nfunctor (up to unique isomorphism) \u03c6C : \u0158\u03bb -pmod \u2192 C sending P\u2205 to C.\nProof. For any object C, there is a unique strongly equivariant functor U(\u03bb) \u2192 C\nsending id\u03bb 7\u2192 C. We wish to show that this factors through the functor from\nU(\u03bb) \u2192 \u0158\u03bb -pmod. By Proposition 1.14, it suffices to check that this map kills any\n2-morphism factoring through uEi id\u03bb . Indeed, this is sent to uEi (C) = 0, so we kill\nthe required 2-morphisms.\n\u0003\nThese algebras are quite interesting; though they are infinite dimensional (unlike\nR ), they seem to have finite global dimension (unlike R\u03bb ). We will explore these\nalgebras and their tensor product analogues in future work.\n\u03bb\n\n2. The tensor product algebras\n2.1. Definition and basic properties. We now proceed to the algebraic construction\nmentioned in the introduction. This is structured around certain algebras which are\npictorial in definition, and similar in flavor to the algebras R\u03bb we have already\ndefined.\n24\n\n\fBen Webster\nThe generators of our algebra are pictures in R2 consisting of red and black\noriented embedded smooth curves decorated with a number (possibly 0) of dots\nsuch that:\n\u2022 each curve begins on the line y = 0 and ends on the line y = 1\n\u2022 each curve is never tangent to a horizontal line\n\u2022 locally around each point, our diagram is either a single line or one of the\npictures:\n\nIn particular, red lines are never allowed to cross, and no pair of lines are\nallowed to meet the lines y = 0 or y = 1 at the same point.\nWe will only ever be interested in these pictures up to isotopy preserving the conditions above.\nConsider the algebra T over k whose generators are pictures as above, with each\nblack line labeled by a simple root of g, and each red line labeled with a dominant\nweight. Multiplication is given by the stacking of diagrams if the pattern of red and\nblack lines with their labels can be isotoped to match up at y = 1 in the first diagram\nand y = 0 in the second and is defined to be 0 otherwise. Of course, this stacking\nmust be followed by smoothing any kinks at the joins of the lines (which is unique\nup to isotopy) and vertical scaling to match the ends up with the correct horizontal\nlines. By convention the product ab means stacking the diagram b on top of the\ndiagram a.\nThe black strands satisfy the quiver Hecke relations from Figure 4, which again\nwe apply as local relations (i.e. any time a small portion of a larger diagram matches\none side of the relation, we equate it to the diagram with the small portion changed\nto match the other side of the relation).\nWe must also include new relations involving red lines which are:\n\u2022 All black crossings and dots can pass through red lines, with a correction\nterm similar to Khovanov and Lauda's (for the latter two relations, we also\ninclude their mirror images):\n\n=\n\n+\n\nX\n\na\n\n\u03b4i, j b\n\na+b+1=\u03bbi\n\nj\n\ni\n\nj\n\ni\n25\n\nj\n\ni\n\n\fKnot invariants and higher representation theory I\n\n=\n\n(2.1)\n\n=\n\n\u2022 The \"cost\" of a separating a red and a black line is adding \u03bbi = \u03b1\u2228i (\u03bb) dots to\nthe black strand.\n=\n(2.2)\n\n\u03bb\n\n\u03bbi\n\ni\n\n=\ni\n\n\u03bb\n\ni\n\ni\n\n\u03bb\n\n\u03bbi\n\n\u03bb\n\n\u2022 If at any point in the diagram any black line is to the left of all reds (i.e.,\nthere is a value a such that the left-most intersection of y = a with a strand is\nwith a black strand), then the diagram is 0. We will refer to such a strand as\nviolating.\nWe also let T\u0303 denote the algebra without the last relation above. While T is\nthe algebra of primary importance for us, T\u0303 will be of great technical utility, since\nwe can construct a basis for it, whereas for T, this seems to be quite out of reach.\nFurthermore, the algebra T\u0303 has a more simple geometric description, as we discuss\nin [Webe, \u00a74].\nFollowing Brundan and Kleshchev, we will sometimes use yi to represent multiplication by a dot on the ith black strand, and \u03c8i to denote the crossing of the ith\nand i + 1st black strands and e(i) to denote the sum of all pictures where there are no\ncrossings or dots, and the black strands are labeled with i = (i1 , . . . , in ) in that order.\nGrading. This algebra is graded with degrees given by\n\u2022 a black/black crossing: \u2212h\u03b1i , \u03b1 j i,\n\u2022 a black dot: h\u03b1i , \u03b1i i = 2di\n\u2022 a red/black crossing: h\u03b1i , \u03bbi = di \u03bbi .\n26\n\n\fBen Webster\na non-violating strand\n\na violating strand\nFigure 7. An example of a violating and non-violating strand\nThis algebra is endowed with a natural anti-automorphism a 7\u2192 \u0227 given by reflecting diagrams in the horizontal axis. If M is a right module over this algebra, we\nlet \u1e40 be the left module given by twisting the action by this anti-automorphism.\nDefinition 2.1 For a finite-dimensional right module M, we define the dual module\nby M\u22c6 = \u1e40\u2217 , where (*)\u2217 denotes usual vector space duality interchanging left and\nright modules.\nThis is a right module since both vector space dual and the anti-automorphism\ninterchange left and right modules.\nDefinition 2.2 For a sequence of weights \u03bb = (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbl ), we let T\u03bb be the subalgebra\nof T where the red lines are labeled, in order, with the elements of \u03bb. We let\nV\u03bb = T\u03bb -mod be the category of finite dimensional representations of T\u03bb graded by\nZ.\n\u03bb\nWe let T\u03b1 for \u03b1 \u2208 Y(g) be the subalgebra of T\u03bb where the sum of the roots associated\nP\nto the black strands is i \u03bbi \u2212 \u03b1.\n\nWe also let T\u0303\u03bb denote the corresponding subalgebra of T\u0303, and K\u03bb denote the kernel\nof the natural map T\u0303\u03bb \u2192 T\u03bb . By definition, K\u03bb is the span of the diagrams in T\u0303\u03bb with\na violating strand, since these elements are generators of the kernel and their span\nis closed under left and right multiplication.\nConsider a sequence of simple roots i = (i1 , . . . , in ), and a weakly increasing map\n\u03ba : [1, l] \u2192 [0, n].\nWe can define an idempotent e(i, \u03ba) as the crossingless diagram where the strands\nare labeled by the roots in the order given by i, with the jth red line immediately\nright of the \u03ba(j)th black line, except that if \u03ba(j)'s agree, the original order of red lines\nis preserved. By convention, if \u03ba(i) = 0, then the ith red strand is left of all black\nstrands. Note that if e(i, \u03ba) is not trivial, we must have \u03ba(1) = 0.\n\nDefinition 2.3 We consider the projective modules P\u03bai = e(i, \u03ba)T\u03bb and P\u0303\u03bai = e(i, \u03ba)T\u0303\u03bb\nand let Ki\u03ba be the kernel of the natural map P\u0303\u03bai \u2192 P\u03bai .\nNote that the kernel K\u03bb can also be described as the span of the elements that\nfactor through P\u0303\u03bai where \u03ba(1) , 0, that is, the trace of these projectives. In categorical\n27\n\n\fKnot invariants and higher representation theory I\nterms, the projective modules over T\u03bb are the quotient of the category of projective\nmodules over T\u0303\u03bb by this collection of projectives.\nWe can generalize this notion a bit by allowing multiplicities \u03b8 j ; we associate a\n(\u03b8 )\n(\u03b8 )\nprojective to the sequence (i1 1 , . . . , in n ) which is a submodule of the projective for\n(\u03b8 )\n\nthe sequence where i j j has been expanded to \u03b8 j instances of i j . This is the projective\ngiven by multiplying each block of strands in the expanded projective on the bottom\nby the idempotent denoted e\u03b8 j in [KL11, \u00a72], which we illustrate in Figure 8.\n\nFigure 8. The idempotent e4 .\nUsually, we will not require these multiplicities, and will thus exclude them from\nthe notation. Unless they are indicated explicitly, the reader should assume that\nthey are 1.\nUnder decategorification, the projective P\u03bai is sent to the vector\n(\u03b8 )\n\n(\u03b8i\n\n)\n\n(\u03b8i\n\n(\u03b8i\n\n)\n\n)\n\n(\u03b8i\n\n)\n\n(\u03b8i )\n\n\u03ba(2)+1\n(Fi\u03ba(2)\u03ba(2) * * * Fi1 1 v1 ) \u2297 v2 ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 vl ),\nFin in * * * Fi\u03ba(l)\u03ba(l) (* * * (Fi\u03ba(3)\u03ba(3) * * * Fi\u03ba(2)+1\n\nwhere vi \u2208 V\u03bbi is a fixed highest weight vector, as we prove in Section 3.2.\n2.2. Examples. To give a simple illustration of the behavior of our algebra, let us\nconsider g = sl2 , and \u03bb = (1, 1). Thus, our diagrams have 2 red lines, both labeled\nwith 1's.\n\u03bb\nIn this case, the algebras T\u03b1 are easily described as follows:\n\u2022 T2(1,1) \u001b k: it is just multiples of the diagram which is just a pair of red lines.\n\u2022 T0(1,1) is spanned by\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\nOne can easily check that this is the standard presentation of a regular block\nof category O for sl2 as a quotient of the path algebra of a quiver (see, for\nexample, [Str03]).\n(1,1)\n\u2022 T\u22122\n\u001b End(k3 ): quotienting out by the left ideal generated by all diagrams\nwith crossings gives the unique irreducible representation. The algebra is\nspanned by the diagrams, which one can easily check multiply (up to sign)\nas the elementary generators of End(k3 ).\n28\n\n\fBen Webster\n\n2.3. A basis and spanning set. Recall that a reduced word in the symmetric group\nis a list of k adjacent transpositions (i, i + 1) whose product cannot be written as a\nshorter product of adjacent transpositions. For each choice of a reduced word w\nfor a permutation of n + l letters which doesn't invert any pair of red strands, we\nhave an element \u03c8w of P\u03bai given by replacing the simple reflection (i, i + 1) with the\ncrossing of the i and i + 1st strands (red or black) and multiplying out the result.\nProposition 2.4 For any fixed choice of reduced word for each permutation, the\nalgebra T\u0303\u03bb has a basis given e(i, \u03ba)\u03c8w ya11 * * * yann for all permutations which preserve\nthe relative order of the red strands and any n-tuple {ai \u2208 Z\u22650 }.\nThis proposition is crucial in that it not only gives us a basis, but an ordered basis;\npermutations have a natural partial order, the strong Bruhat order.\nWe will always refer to the process of rewriting an element in terms of this basis as\n\"straightening\" since visually, it is akin to pulling all the strands taut until they are\nstraight, though this image is slightly misleading, as we will explain momentarily.\nProof. The proof is directly analogous to that of [KL09, Theorem 2.5].\nFirst we show is that this set spans, for which is suffices to show that \u03c8w for any\nword can be rewritten in terms of yi 's times \u03c8w\u2032 for our fixed choice of reduced\nwords and shorter diagrams.\nIf w is not a reduced word in the symmetric group, then by applying braid\nrelations (which hold modulo shorter words), we can assume that there are two consecutive crossings of the same strands, which can be simplified using the relations\nand written in terms of \u03c8w\u2032 for shorter words w\u2032 .\nIf w is a reduced word, then the fixed reduced word corresponding to the same\npermutation w\u2032 differs from w by Tits moves, so the difference between \u03c8w \u2212 \u03c8w\u2032\ncan thus be written in terms of shorter diagrams.\nThe difficult part is to show that the elements are linearly independent. First,\nwe note that T\u0303\u03bb has a version of Khovanov and Lauda's polynomial representation,\nwhere T\u0303\u03bb acts on a direct sum of polynomial rings k[y1 , . . . , yn ] over all choices of i\nand \u03ba by the rule (where in each case, there are k \u2212 1 black strands to the left of the\nportion of the diagram shown) shown in Figure 9.\n29\n\n\fKnot invariants and higher representation theory I\ni\n\n\u03bb\n\ni\n\n\u03bb\n\ni\n\nf 7\u2192 y\u03bbk * f\n\nf 7\u2192 1 * f\n\u03bb\n\ni\nj\n\ni\n\n\u03bb\n\ni\ni\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nf \u2192\n7 (k, k + 1) * f\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nf \u2192\n7 Qij (yk , yk+1 )(k, k + 1) * f\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nf \u2212(k,k+1)* f\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3f \u2192\n7\nyk \u2212yk+1\n\nj\n\ni< j\ni> j\ni= j\n\ni\nf 7\u2192 yk * f\ni\nFigure 9. The polynomial representation of T\u0303\u03bb\nThe action of black diagrams is that of Khovanov-Lauda (in original signs, this is\n[KL09, Theorem 2.3], and is discussed with sign modifications in the final section of\n[KL11]; the most general version for arbitrary Q\u2217,\u2217 is covered in [Rou, Proposition\n3.12]), so the only relations we need check are our additional relations (2.1) and (2.2).\nThe only one of these which is interesting is the first line of (2.1). The LHS is\ni\n\nf 7\u2192\nand the RHS is\n\ni\n\ny\u03bbk f \u2212 y\u03bbk+1 (k, k + 1) * f\nyk \u2212 yk+1\n\ni\n\nf 7\u2192\n\ni\ny\u03bbk+1\n\ni\n\nf \u2212 (k, k + 1) * f y\u03bbk \u2212 y\u03bbk+1\n+\nf\nyk \u2212 yk+1\nyk \u2212 yk+1\n\nand the relation is verified.\nThe most important consequence of this is that Khovanov and Lauda's algebra\nR injects into T\u0303\u03bb , since any element of the kernel acts trivially on the polynomial\nrepresentation, and thus is trivial.\nNow, we show that we have a basis in general by reducing to this case. Assume\nthat there is a non-trivial linear relation between vectors of the form in the statement.\n30\n\n\fBen Webster\nThen we can compose on the bottom with the element \u03b8\u03ba , which pulls all black\nstrands to the right and red to the left, and on the top with \u03b8\u0307\u03ba . Pulling all black\nstrands to the right (as described above when showing our desired elements span),\nwe obtain a relation in R. On the other hand, there must be a \u03c8w ya with nontrivial\ncoefficient maximal in Bruhat order compared to all other diagrams with non-trivial\ncoefficients. Since pulling right only adds correction terms strictly smaller in Bruhat\norder, we have a relation in R where the corresponding diagram to \u03c8w ya has nontrivial coefficient. Since these elements are a basis, this coefficient must be trivial,\ngiving a contradiction. Thus, this relation is trivial and we have a basis of T\u0303\u03bb .\n\u0003\nProposition 2.5 For any fixed choice of reduced word for each permutation, the\nelements \u03c8w generate P\u03bai as a module over the subalgebra generated by the yi 's.\nProof. Clear from the fact that T\u0303\u03bb surjects onto T\u03bb .\n\n\u0003\n\nIn order to organize our computations, we must keep track of leading terms in\nthis basis under multiplication; the term \"straightening\" suggests that these will\nroughly correspond to the multiplication of permutations. The reality is a bit more\nsubtle. In order to do this, we consider the category \u2127n whose objects are ordered\nn elements sets labeled with simple roots of our algebra, and whose morphisms\nare label preserving maps. Obviously, every diagram in T\u0303\u03bb gives such a map by\nsimply tracing out the black strands (we ignore red strands for the time being). We\nnow wish to put a slightly strange composition on these maps which will give us a\ndifferent category from the naive one with these morphisms.\nIn order to compose morphisms a and b, we factor each in a minimal length way\ninto the naive product of a number of simple involutions, i.e. those that switch\nadjacent elements in the order. Now, we consider the concatenation of these words,\nwhich we endeavor to simplify. We impose the usual braid relations on involutions,\nbut we change how they square. If si = (i, i + 1) in cycle notation, we impose that\ns2i = 1 if the ith and i + 1th have different labels and s2i = si is the labels are the same.\nNote that if the concatenation is not a reduced word, we can apply braid relations\nuntil there are two adjacent si 's in the word, which we can simplify to obtain a\nshorter word. This process terminates at a reduced word for a unique permutation.\nWe note that morphisms in this category can be given the usual Bruhat order.\nProposition 2.6 Given any diagram x \u2208 T\u0303\u03bb with associated morphism \u03c9x in \u2127n ,\nwhen x is written in terms of basis elements, all diagrams which appear have\nassociated morphisms shorter than or equal to \u03c9x in \u2127n .\nProof. This is clear from the quiver Hecke relations of Figure 4 and the algorithm for\nwriting a morphism in terms of the basis, since all relations for reducing the \"length\"\nof a diagram, or to adjust it to fit a particular reduced word of a permutation only\n31\n\n\fKnot invariants and higher representation theory I\nintroduce extra terms shorter in Bruhat order. We must use \u2127n because these\nrelations will sometimes remove a si which permutes two like colored strands from\na word where s2i appears. This could increase the length in the usual multiplication\nof the symmetric group, but will not in \u2127n .\n\u0003\nThis proposition has another important consequence. Let \u03ba1 , \u03ba2 be two weakly\nincreasing functions [1, l] \u2192 [0, n] and assume that for some j we have \u03bai (j) = \u03bai (j+1)\nfor i = 1, 2. Then, we let \u03bb\u2032 denote \u03bb with the block \u03bbk , \u03bbk+1 replaced by \u03bbk + \u03bbk+1 and\nlet\n(\n\u03bai (k)\nk\u2264j\n\u2032\n\u03bai (k) =\n\u03bai (k + 1) k > j.\nThere is an obvious map\n\u2032\n\nc\u0303 : e(i, \u03ba\u20321 )T\u0303\u03bb e(i, \u03ba\u20322 ) \u2192 e(i, \u03ba1 )T\u0303\u03bb e(i, \u03ba2 )\ngiven by separating the kth red strand into 2 strands, labeled with \u03bbk and \u03bbk+1 , and\nalso an induced map on quotients\n\u2032\n\nc : e(i, \u03ba\u20321 )T\u03bb e(i, \u03ba\u20322 ) \u2192 e(i, \u03ba1 )T\u03bb e(i, \u03ba2 ).\nCorollary 2.7 The maps c\u0303 and c are isomorphisms.\nProof. The fact for c\u0303 simply follows from the fact that the bases of Proposition 2.4\ncorrespond under this map.\nNote further that under c\u0303 that any element of e(i, \u03ba1 )T\u0303\u03bb e(i, \u03ba2 ) which has a violating\nstrand can be rewritten by sliding all crossings and dots out of the space between\nthe k and k+1st strands to be the image of an element with a violating strand under c\u0303.\nSince the kernels to the projections to the domain and target of c correspond under\nc\u0303, we must have that c is an isomorphism.\n\u0003\n2.4. Relationship to quiver Hecke algebras. If \u03bb = (\u03bb), then we will simplify\nnotation by writing T\u03bb for T\u03bb , and Pi for P0i .\nTheorem 2.8 R\u03bb \u001b T\u03bb .\nProof. By composing the inclusion R \u0592\u2192 T\u0303\u03bb given by adding a red line at the left\nand the projection T\u0303\u03bb \u2192 T\u03bb , we obtain a map. This map is a surjection since any\nelement of the basis of Proposition 2.4 not in the image contains a strand to the left\nof the single red strand and thus is sent to 0.\nThe image of R in T\u0303\u03bb is readily identifiable: it is the span of all diagrams where\nboth at y = 0 and y = 1, the single red strand is left of all blacks. The image is clearly\ncontained in this space, since the image of a diagram in R satisfies this condition\nfor all values of y, and any diagram with this condition can be rewritten using the\nTheorem 2.4 as a sum of elements where no two strands cross twice. Since the red\n32\n\n\fBen Webster\nstrand is at the far left both at y = 0 and y = 1, it cannot cross a black strand exactly\nonce, and thus must not cross with any of them; that is, we have written our element\nin terms of basis vectors in the image of R. Let e0 be the idempotent given by the\nimage of the identity in R. We note that left multiplication by e0 kills exactly the\ndiagrams which do not have the red strand at the far left at the bottom and similarly\nfor right multiplication and the top, so R = e0 T\u0303\u03bb e0 .\nThe kernel of the map R \u2192 T\u03bb is thus the intersection K\u03bb \u2229 R; we must show\nthat this coincides with the cyclotomic ideal. First note that K\u03bb \u2229 R = e0 K\u03bb e0 . By\ndefinition, K\u03bb is spanned by elements with a violating strand, so K\u03bb \u2229 R is spanned\nby all elements with a violating strand where the red strand is at the left at the top\nand bottom.\nIn such a diagram, we can slide all violating black strands back over the red.\nWe thus obtain \u03bbi dots on all \u03b1i -colored strands that were violating in the earlier\ndiagram. In particular, any one of these strands which has no other strand to its left\nat the point where it was violating carries \u03bbi dots, and thus lies in the cyclotomic\nideal. On the other hand, for any element in the cyclotomic ideal, when can simply\nslide the leftmost strand left at the point where it carries \u03bbi dots to obtain a violating\nstrand. This gives the equality of ideals and thus the desired isomorphism.\n\u0003\nThis cyclotomic quotient plays several important roles in \"controlling\" the representation theory of T\u03bb . Consider the projectives where \u03ba(i) = 0 for all i, in which\ncase we will simply denote the projective for \u03ba by P0i . We note that P0i carries an\nobvious action of R by composition on the bottom. We let P0 = \u2295iP0i be the sum of\nall such projectives with \u03ba(i) = 0, and P = \u2295i Pi be the corresponding module over\nT\u03bb .\nProposition 2.9 EndT\u03bb (P0 ) \u001b T\u03bb \u001b R\u03bb .\nProof. The first isomorphism follows from repeated application of Corollary 2.7. The\nsecond is just a restatement of Proposition 2.8\n\u0003\n2.5. The module category structure. Based on the graphical calculus developed in\nthe Section 1, we can define an action of U on the categories V\u03bb . First, we define a\ncandidate functors by a simple extension of our graphical calculus. Each of these is\ndefined sending a module M to a module spanned by diagrams containing a coupon\nthat carries elements of M.\nThe induction F\u0303i M of an T\u0303\u03bb -module M is the vector space generated by diagrams\nas in Figure 10 for m \u2208 M, modulo the relation that the sum of diagrams which are\nidentical outside the coupon is given by adding the labels on the coupon.\nThe algebra T\u0303\u03bb acts by multiplication on the top, simplifying using Proposition 2.5\nso that all crossings of strands connecting the coupon occur below the new strand,\nand absorbing these into the coupon.\n33\n\n\fKnot invariants and higher representation theory I\ni\n\ni\n***\n\n***\n\n***\n\n***\n\nm\n\nm\n\nFi\n\nEi\nFigure 10. The functors Ei and Fi\n\nMore algebraically, this is an extension of scalars; We have a map \u03bdi : T\u0303\u03bb \u2192 T\u0303\u03bb\ngiven by adding a i-colored strand at the far right, and F\u0303i M \u001b T\u0303\u03bb \u2297T\u0303\u03bb M where the\ntensor product is taken over the ring map \u03bdi .\nDefinition 2.10 Induction for T\u03bb -modules is defined by Fi M = F\u0303i M \u2297T\u0303\u03bb T\u03bb for\n\u03bb\nM \u2208 V\u03bc .\nAnalogous restriction functors \u1ebci , Ei right adjoint to these are defined by the\nsecond set of pictures in Figure 10.\nThese functors give an action of U, as we will show momentarily; we should note\nthat in order for this action to make sense, we must assign a category to each weight,\nrefining the category that corresponds to the entire representation. To calculate the\nweight in which P\u03bai belongs, one should add the weights on the red lines minus the\nroots on the black strands.\nMore generally, we can imagine labeling the regions of the diagram starting with\n0 at the left, and using the rule given in [KL10, \u00a73.1.1], which the additional rule\nthat the label on the region right of a red strand minus that to its left is the label of\nthe strand itself. The weight we identify above would be the label at the far right of\nthe diagram.\nProposition 2.11 There is a representation of U which sends\n\u03bb\n\n\u03bc 7\u2192 V\u03bc\n\nEi 7\u2192 Ei\n\nFi 7\u2192 Fi .\n\nThe action of 2-morphisms is simply by composition on the bottom of the diagram,\nperhaps followed by simplification.\nIn particular, the functors Fi and Ei are exact.\nWe have added the orientations in Figure 10 in order to make the action of 2morphisms easier to visualize.\n34\n\n\fBen Webster\nProof. First note that it is enough to show that the correct relations hold if the functors\nare applied to M = P\u03bai for any (i, \u03ba).\nThis can be proven by constructing an auxiliary category which clearly has a U\naction and which has T\u03bb as a quotient. This category is quite close in spirit to T\u0303\u03bb ,\ne whose\nbut we must use an enlargement of it. Thus, we define a 2-category U\n\n\u2022 objects are weights,\n\u2022 1-morphisms are sequences of Ei 's, Fi 's and I\u03bb 's such that sum of the corresponding weights is the difference between target and image. We translate\nthese into sequences of colored dots as usual by sending I\u03bb to red dots marked\nwith \u03bb.\n\u2022 2-morphisms between two of these objects are k-linear combinations of immersed oriented diagrams where no red strands cross or self-intersect that\nmatch, subject to the relations of Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4, and the relations for T\u03bb\n(remember, all these relations are local and imposed up to isotopy, but they\ndo take into account orientations of red and black strands.). Furthermore, we\nmust impose similar relations between red strands and oppositely oriented\nred strands\n\n=\nj\n\ni\n\nj\n\n=\n\n=\n\n35\n\ni\n\n\fKnot invariants and higher representation theory I\n\n=\n\u03bb\n\ni\n\n\u03bb\n\ni\n\ni\n\n\u03bb\n\n=\n\u03bb\n\ni\n\u03bc\n\nThis category acts on \u2295\u03bc,\u03bdV\u03bd by the usual action of Ei and Fi , and letting I\u03bb act\nby sending M to the same module considered as a module over T\u03bc+\u03bb . On the level\nto the obvious projection map\nof 2-morphisms, this action sends the crossing\nFi I\u03bb \u2192 I\u03bb Fi and\nto the map multiplying at the bottom by \u03bbi dots on the new\nstrand formed by applying Fi .\nIn particular, the inclusion of U by horizontally composing with any set of red\ne\nlines to the left is injective. It follows by the same arguments as Theorem 2.4 that U\n\nhas a basis analogous to that of Khovanov and Lauda for U.\ne where the red lines are fixed to\nNow consider the U-module subcategory of U\nhave labels \u03bb in order, and consider its quotient by all 1-morphisms of the form AEi\nand all 2-morphisms given by positive degree bubbles at the far left of the diagram.\nThe argument that the idempotent completion of this category is the category of\n\u0003\nprojective T\u03bb modules is precisely the same as the proof of Proposition 1.7.\nThis shows, in particular, that K0 (T\u03bb ) is a module over UqZ (g), which we will show\nin the next section is isomorphic to the tensor product V\u03bbZ .\n3. Standard modules\n3.1. Standard modules defined. When analyzing the structure of representationtheoretic categories, such as the categories O appearing in Stroppel's construction of\nKhovanov homology [Str], a crucial role is played by the Verma modules and their\nanalogues. The property of \"having objects like Verma modules\" was formalized\nby Cline-Parshall-Scott as the property of being quasi-hereditary [CPS88]. Unfortunately, this is too strong of an assumption for us; as we noted earlier, the cyclotomic\nQHA is Frobenius, and thus very far from being quasi-hereditary (any ring which\nis both Frobenius and quasi-hereditary is semi-simple).\nLuckily, our categories satisfy a weaker condition: they are standardly stratified,\nas defined by the same authors [CPS96]. To show this, we must construct a collection\n36\n\n\fBen Webster\nof modules which are called standard, and show that projectives have a filtration\nby these modules compatible with a preorder.\nWe define a preorder on (i, \u03ba)'s by calling (i, \u03ba) \u2264 (i\u2032 , \u03ba\u2032 ) if\nX\nX\n\u03b1ik \u2264\n\u03b1i\u2032k for all j \u2208 [1, l].\nk\u2264\u03ba( j)\n\nk\u2264\u03ba\u2032 ( j)\n\nThis preorder can be packaged as the dominance order for a function \u03b1i,\u03ba : [1, l] \u2192\nX(g) which we call a root function given by\nX\n\u03b1i j .\n\u03b1i,\u03ba (k) =\n\u03ba(k\u22121)<j\u2264\u03ba(k)\n\nNote that this preorder is entirely insensitive to permutations of the black strands\nwhich do not cross any red strands.\nDefinition 3.1 By convention, we call a red/black crossing where black strands go\nfrom NW to SE left and the mirror image of such a crossing right.\nNote that this terminology does not apply to black/black crossings; if we call a\ncrossing left or right we are implicitly assuming it is black/red.\n\na \"left\" crossing\n\na \"right\" crossing\n\nThe significance of these definitions is that a map induced between projectives by\nadding a left crossing on the bottom always sends a projective to one smaller in the\npreorder \u2264, and vice versa for right crossings. We will call a black strand that makes\na left crossing below all right crossings standardly violating.\nLet L\u03bai \u2282 P\u03bai be the submodule generated by diagrams with no right crossings,\nand at least one left crossing; that is, the module spanned by all diagrams with\nstandardly violating strands.\nProposition 3.2 The image of any map from a projective higher than (i, \u03ba) in the\npreorder \u2264 is contained in L\u03bai \u2282 P\u03bai , and these images generate L\u03bai . That is, the\nsubmodule L\u03bai is the \"trace\" of these projectives.\nProof. Generation is clear: any diagram with only left crossings defines a map from a\nhigher projective to P\u03bai with the image of the idempotent being the original diagram.\nTo show that any such image lands in L\u03bai , consider an arbitrary map from a higher\nprojective. This is given by a sum of diagrams in P\u03bai whose upper end points are\ngiven by the idempotent for that projective. Now, apply Proposition 2.5 with a set\nof representatives that do all crossings within blocks consisting of a red strand and\nthe black strands to its immediate left before doing any others. By the definition of\n37\n\n\fKnot invariants and higher representation theory I\nthe preorder, all these diagrams must have at least one left crossing which occurs\nbefore we make any crossings between these blocks, and all right crossings involve\nstrands from different blocks; thus the image lies in L\u03bai .\n\u0003\nDefinition 3.3 We define S\u03bai = P\u03bai /L\u03bai to be the standard module for \u03ba and i.\nProposition 3.2 shows that this matches the definition of a standard module for\nan algebra with preorder on its projectives given in (for instance) [MS08], so our\nterminology matches theirs. Below, when we speak of a group of black strands, we\nwill always mean the set of black strands which originate between two consecutive\nred strands at the bottom of the diagram.\nLet e\u03b1 be the idempotent which is 1 on projectives P\u03bai with \u03b1i,\u03ba = \u03b1. We let S\u03b1 be\nthe standard quotient of the projective e\u03b1 T\u03bb . Let C\u03b1 be the subcategory of modules\nwith a presentation in add(S\u03b1 ) for fixed \u03b1.\n\ne\u03b1 T \u03bb\n\n\u03bbl\nT\u03b1(l)\n\n\u03bb1\nT\u03b1(1)\n\n\u03bbl\n\u03bb1\non e\u03b1 T\u03bb .\nFigure 11. The action of T\u03b1(1)\n\u2297 * * * \u2297 T\u03b1(l)\n\nActing by black-black crossings on just each group of strands as in Figure 11 gives\n\u03bb\n\u03bbl\n\u03bbl\n\u03bb1\n\u03bb1\n\u2212 T\u03b1 \u2192 EndT\u03bb (S\u03b1 ), so we can think of S\u03b1 as a T\u03b1(1)\na map T\u03b1(1)\n\u2297 * * * \u2297 T\u03b1(l)\n\u2297 * * * \u2297 T\u03b1(l)\nbimodule, and S = \u2295\u03b1 S\u03b1 as a T\u03bb1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 T\u03bbl \u2212 T\u03bb -bimodule.\nDefinition 3.4 The standardization functor is the tensor product with this bimodule:\nS\u03bb (\u2212) = \u2212 \u2297T\u03bb1 \u2297***\u2297T\u03bbl S : V\u03bb1 ;...;\u03bbl \u2192 V\u03bb\nMore generally, we can construct partial standard modules, where we only kill\nthe left crossings for some of the red strands. This will give us a standardization\nfunctor\nS\u03bb1 ;...;\u03bbm : V\u03bb1 ;...;\u03bbl \u2192 V\u03bb\nfor any sequence of sequences \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbm such that the concatenation \u03bb1 * * * \u03bbm is\nequal to \u03bb.\n38\n\n\fBen Webster\nOf particular interest is the standardization functor which corresponds to adding\na new red strand labeled \u03bc and no black ones, since this categorifies the inclusion\nof V\u03bb \u2297 {vhigh } \u0592\u2192 V\u03bb \u2297 V\u03bc . We denote this functor S\u03bb;\u03bc (\u2212 \u22a0 P\u2205 ) = I\u03bc .\nWe can think of the standardization functor as a (very far from full) inclusion of\nthe naive tensor product category into V\u03bb . This functor is full when only considered\non objects corresponding to a single root function, but there are, of course, many\n\"new\" maps between the different values.\n3.2. Decategorification. In order to understand the Grothendieck group K0 (T\u03bb ), we\nneed to better understand its Euler form. In particular, we need a candidate bilinear\nform on V\u03bb . There is a system of non-degenerate Uq (g)-invariant sesquilinear forms\nh, i on all tensor products V\u03bbZ defined by hv, wi = h\u0398(l) v, wip , where \u0398(l) is the l-fold\nquasi-R-matrix and h\u2212, \u2212ip is the term-wise q-Shapovalov form. The usual quasiR-matrix on two tensor factors is defined in [Lus93, \u00a74]; the l-fold one is defined\ninductively by \u0398(l) = (\u0398(2) \u2297 1\u2297l\u22122 ) * \u2206 \u2297 1\u2297l\u22122 (\u0398(l\u22121) ).\nProposition 3.5 This form is non-degenerate, and \u03c4-Hermitian in the sense that\nwe have hu * v, v\u2032 i = hv, \u03c4(u) * v\u2032 i for any v, v\u2032 \u2208 V\u03bb and u \u2208 Uq (g), where \u03c4 is the\nantiautomorphism defined in Section 1.3.\nj+1\nFurthermore, for any j < l, the natural map V\u03bb1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 V\u03bb j \u2297 {vh } \u2297 * * * \u2297 {vlh } \u0592\u2192 V\u03bb\nis an isometric embedding.\nProof. The first statement follows from\n(l)\n\u2032\n \u0304\n \u0304\nhu * v, v\u2032i = h\u0398(l) \u2206(u)v, v\u2032 ip = h\u2206(u)\u0398\nv, v\u2032 ip = h\u0398(l) v, (\u03c4 \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u03c4)\u2206(u)v\nip\n\n= h\u0398(l) v, \u2206(\u03c4(u))v\u2032 ip = hv, \u03c4(u) * v\u2032 i.\n\nThe second reduces to case of two factors, since h\u2212, \u2212i is a multiple of the qShapovalov form on any simple submodule of a tensor product. In this case it\nfollows form the fact that \u0398(2) \u2208 U\u2212 \u2297 U+ and \u0398(2)\n= 1 \u00d7 1, so \u0398(2) fixes v \u2297 vhigh . \u0003\n0\nLet v\u03bai \u2208 V\u03bb be defined inductively by\n\u2212\n\n\u2022 if \u03ba(l) = n, then v\u03bai = v\u03bai \u2297 vl where vl is the highest weight vector of V\u03bbl , and\n\u03ba\u2212 is the restriction to [1, l \u2212 1].\n\u2022 If \u03ba(l) , n, so v\u03bai = Fin v\u03bai\u2212 , where i\u2212 = (i1 , . . . , in\u22121 ).\n\nTheorem 3.6 There is a canonical isomorphism \u03b7 : K0 (T\u03bb ) \u2192 V\u03bbZ given by [P\u03bai ] 7\u2192 v\u03bai\nintertwining the inner product defined above with the Euler form.\nProof. First, note that\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ndimq Hom(P\u03bai , P\u03bai\u2032 ) = hv\u03bai\u2032 , v\u03bai\u2032 i.\n\nWe prove this by induction on n and l. Unless n = \u03ba(l) = \u03ba\u2032 (l), we can move a Fi\nfrom one side to become a Ei on the other (up to shift). The decompositions of Ei P\u03bai\n39\n\n\fKnot invariants and higher representation theory I\n\u2032\u2032\n\ninto P\u03bai\u2032\u2032 's matches that of the vector since both are done using the commutation\nrelations between Ei and Fi or Ei and Fi , which we already know match.\nIf n = \u03ba(l) = \u03ba\u2032 (l), then the dimension of the Hom-space and the inner product\nare both unchanged by simply removing the red line (obviously, this holds if we use\n\u2032\nP\u0303\u03bai and P\u0303\u03bai\u2032 by the basis of Theorem 2.4, and the isomorphism only sends elements\nwith violating strands to elements with violating strands). This shows the equality.\nThus, if we are given any linear relation satisfied by [P\u03bai ]'s, the corresponding\nlinear combination of v\u03bai 's is in the kernel of this form, and thus 0 in V\u03bb . Thus, the\nmap \u03b7 is well-defined and surjective.\nA surjective map of finitely generated free Z[q, q\u22121 ] modules is an isomorphism if\nand only if they have the same rank (the kernel must be a summand, which is zero\nif and only if its complement has the rank of the whole module). Thus, we need\n\u03bb\nonly prove that V\u03bd has at most dim(V\u03bb )\u03bd simple modules.\nConsider a simple module L, and let \u03b1 be maximal among root functions for which\nLe\u03b1 , 0. Let K be any simple constituent of Le\u03b1 as a T\u03bb1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 T\u03bbl -module. Then, by\nadjunction, we have a surjective map S\u03bb (K) \u2192 L. As modules over T\u03bb1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 T\u03bbl ,\nwe have a surjective map K \u2192 S\u03bb (K)e\u03b1 which is an isomorphism, so by assumption\ncomposing with the map to L gives an inclusion of K. This implies that every proper\nsubmodule of S\u03bb (K) is killed by e\u03b1 ; thus, the sum of all proper submodules is itself\nkilled by e\u03b1 and thus proper itself. This implies that the cosocle of S\u03bb (K) is simple\nand thus L. Thus L is uniquely determined by K, and there no more simple objects\nin V\u03bb than there are in V\u03bb1 ;...,;\u03bbl , which has exactly dim V\u03bb simple modules. Thus,\nthe ranks coincide, and we are done.\n\u0003\n\nNow, we let s\u03bai = Fi\u03ba(2) * * * Fi1 v1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 Fin * * * Fi\u03ba(l)+1 vl .\nProposition 3.7 \u03b7([S\u03bai ]) = s\u03bai .\nProof.

Note that we need only consider the case where m = l and \u03bbi = (\u03bbi ). We induct\nas in the proof of Theorem 3.6 on n and l. It suffices to prove that Hom(P\u03bai , S\u03bb (\u2212)) is\nalways exact since every indecomposable projective is a summand of P\u03bai .\nUnless n = \u03ba(l), the projective P\u03bai is a sum of summands of modules of the form\nFi (P\u2032 ). Thus, we can use the adjunction\nHom(Fi (P\u2032 ), S\u03bb (\u2212)) \u001b Hom(P\u2032 , Ei S\u03bb (\u2212)).\nSince Ei S\u03bb (M) is filtered by the modules S\u03bb ( j Ei M) where j Ei is the categorification\nfunctor applied in the jth tensor factor. By induction, we have that S\u03bb ( j Ei (\u2212)) is\nexact, so this establishes this induction step.\n\u2212\nIf n = \u03ba(l), then Hom(P\u03bai , S\u03bb (M)) is the same as Hom(P\u03bai , S(\u03bb1 ,...,\u03bbl\u22121 ) (M+ )) where M+\nis the T\u03bb1 \u2297* * *\u2297T\u03bbl\u22121 submodule in M where the weight for T\u03bbl is \u03bbl . Since M 7\u2192 M+ is\nexact (it is the projection of a sum of idempotents), by induction M 7\u2192 S(\u03bb1 ,...,\u03bbl\u22121 ) (M+ )\nis exact as well. This completes the induction step, and thus the proof.\n\u0003\n3.3. Simple modules and crystals. Lauda and Vazirani show that there is a natural\ncrystal structure on simple representations of R\u03bb = T\u03bb , which is isomorphic to the\nusual highest weight crystal B(\u03bb). A similar crystal structure exists for simples of\nT\u03bb ; we denote the set of isomorphism classes of simple modules by B\u03bb .\nNote that we have a candidate for a map\nh : B\u03bb1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 B\u03bbl \u2192 B\u03bb ,\ngiven by cosoc S\u03bb (L1 \u22a0 * * * \u22a0 Ll ); it's not immediately obvious that this module is\nsimple, but in fact, we have already shown in the proof of Theorem 3.6 that this\nmap is well-defined, and surjective. Since V\u03bb and V\u03bb1 ;...,;\u03bbl has the same number of\nsimples, we have that\nTheorem 3.10 The map h defines a bijection.\n43\n\n\fKnot invariants and higher representation theory I\nFor a simple module L, the modules cosoc(Fi L), and soc(Ei L) are both several\ncopies of a single simple module. We define f \u0303i (L) and \u1ebdi (L) to be these simples.\nTheorem 3.11 These operators make the classes of the simple modules a perfect\nbasis of K0 (T\u03bb ) in the sense of Berenstein and Kazhdan [BK07, Definition 5.30]. In\nparticular, they define a crystal structure on simple modules.\nProof. This proof uses entirely standard techniques. If a is the largest integer such\nthat \u1ebdai (L) , 0, then Eai (L) is semi-simple; in fact, it is a sum of copies of \u1ebdai (L) (since\n(a)\nFi (\u1ebdai (L)) surjects onto L). In particular, any other simple constituent of Ei (L) is\nkilled by \u1ebda\u22121\n. This is the definition of a perfect basis.\n\u0003\ni\nProposition 3.12 Any simple module L \u2208 B\u03bb is isomorphic to its dual: L \u001b L\u22c6 .\nProof. This was shown for B\u03bb by Khovanov and Lauda in [KL09, \u00a73.2].\nNow, consider the general case. On the subcategory of modules killed by e\u03b1\u2032 for\n\u2032\n\u03b1 \u0002 \u03b1, the functor M 7\u2192 Me\u03b1 is a functor to V\u03bb1 ;...;\u03bbl , which has a left adjoint S\u03bb and\nright adjoint \u22c6 \u25e6 S\u03bb \u25e6 \u22c6. Obviously, the socle of S\u03bb (L1 \u22a0 * * * \u22a0 Ll )\u22c6 and the cosocle of\nS\u03bb (L1 \u22a0 * * * \u22a0 Ll ) are dual simple modules.\nOn the other hand, we have a map\nS\u03bb (L1 \u22a0 * * * \u22a0 Ll ) \u2192 S\u03bb (L\u22c61 \u22a0 * * * \u22a0 L\u22c6l )\u22c6\nThis map is non-zero, since the induced map\nS\u03bb (L1 \u22a0 * * * \u22a0 Ll )e\u03b1 \u2192 S\u03bb (L\u22c61 \u22a0 * * * \u22a0 L\u22c6l )\u22c6 e\u03b1\nis the identity map from L1 \u22a0 * * * \u22a0 Ll to L1 \u22a0 * * * \u22a0 Ll . On the other hand, its image\nlies in the socle, and thus is an isomorphism from h(L1 , . . . , Ll ) to its dual, since we\nalready know Li is self-dual.\n\u0003\nSince K0 (T\u03bb ) \u001b V\u03bb , this implies that an isomorphism of crystals exists between B\u03bb\nand B\u03bb1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 B\u03bbl without actually determining what it is.\nConjecture 3.13 The crystal structure induced on B\u03bb by h has Kashiwara operators\ngiven by f \u0303i and \u1ebdi , where B\u03bb1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 B\u03bbl is endowed with the tensor product crystal\nstructure.\nThis conjecture is shown in recent work of the author and Losev [LW, 7.2].\nChoose any infinite sequence {i1 , . . . , } of simple roots such that each root appears\ninfinitely often. For any element v of a highest weight crystal, there are unique\nintegers {a1 , . . . } such that * * * \u1ebdai22 \u1ebdai11 v = vhigh and \u1ebdakk +1 * * * \u1ebdai11 v = 0; the parametrization\nof the elements of the crystal by this tuple is called the \"string parametrization.\"\n44\n\n\fBen Webster\nOur system of projectives P\u03bai is quite redundant; there are many more of them\nthan there are simple modules, as Proposition 3.10 shows. We can produce a smaller\nprojective generators by using string parametrizations.\nDefinition 3.14 We call a sequence (i, \u03ba) stringy if the sequence of i's between the\njth and j + 1st red lines is the string parametrization of a crystal basis vector in V\u03bb j .\nWe will implicitly use the canonical identification between stringy sequences and\n\u03bb\nB via h.\nAs in Khovanov and Lauda [KL09, \u00a73.2], we order the elements of the crystal by\nfirst decreasing weight (so that the smallest element is the highest weight vector)\nand then lexicographically by the string parametrization.\nFor the tensor product crystal, we use the dominance order on \u03b1's, with the order\non nodes in the factors used lexicographically to break ties.\nProposition 3.15 The projective cover of any simple appears as a summand of P\u03bai\nwhere (i, \u03ba) is the corresponding stringy sequence. This cover is, in fact, the unique\n\u2032\nindecomposable summand which doesn't appear in P\u03bai\u2032 for (i\u2032 , \u03ba\u2032 ) > (i, \u03ba).\nAs a matter of convention, we call the root function of the stringy sequence where\nan indecomposable projective first appears the root function of that projective.\n(a\n\n(a\n\n)\n\n)\n\n\u03ba(l)+1\n\u03ba(2)\n1)\nP\u2205 \u22a0 * * * \u22a0 Fi(an n ) * * * Fi\u03ba(l)+1\nP\u2205 ) which in\n* * * F(a\nProof. Obviously, P\u03bai \u0589 S\u03bai = S\u03bb (Fi\u03ba(2)\ni1\nturn surjects to the corresponding simple, by the definition of Kashiwara operators\non simple modules, and the map h. Thus, the indecomposable projective cover is a\nsummand of P\u03bai .\nFor a simple L, there is only a map of P\u03bai to L if Lei,\u03ba , 0, which is impossible for (i, \u03ba)\n\n(a\n\n)\n\n(a\n\n)\n\nj\u22121)\nP\u2205 ,\nstringy unless L is the image under h of simples that appear in Fi\u03ba(\u03ba(j)j) * * * Fi\u03ba(\u03ba(j\u22121)+1\nor L is higher in the dominance order. Since only larger simples in Khovanov and\n(a\u03ba( j\u22121) )\n(a\u03ba( j) )\nLauda's order appear in Fi\u03ba( j) * * * Fi\u03ba( j\u22121)+1 P\u2205 by [KL09, Lemma 3.7], the projective\ncover of any simple which appears other than that for our chosen stringy sequence\nis a summand in a projective for a higher stringy sequence.\n\u0003\n\nFor an indecomposable projective P, its standard quotient is its quotient under\nthe sum of all images of maps from projectives with higher root sequences. This\ncoincides with its image in S\u03bai , the standard quotient for its associated stringy sequence. This standard quotient is indecomposable, since it is a quotient of an\nindecomposable projective.\nProposition 3.16 Consider (i, \u03ba) with the associated root function \u03b1. Then the sum\nof indecomposable summands of P\u03bai that have the same root function surject to S\u03bai ,\nwhich is a direct sum of the standard quotients of those projectives.\n45\n\n\fKnot invariants and higher representation theory I\nProof. If an indecomposable summand of P\u03bai has a different root function, it must be\nhigher, so this summand is in the image of a higher stringy projective and thus in\nL\u03bai . Thus, the other summands must surject.\nSimilarly, it is clear that the intersection of any indecomposable with the same root\nfunction with L\u03bai is exactly the trace of the projectives with higher root functions. \u0003\nFinally, we prove a result which, while somewhat technical in nature, is very\nimportant for understanding how to decategorify our construction. As in [BGS96,\n\u00a72.12], we let C\u2191 (T\u03bb ) denote the category of complexes of graded modules satisfying\nCij = 0 for i \u226b 0 or i + j \u226a 0.\nTheorem 3.17 Every simple module over T\u03bb has a projective resolution in C\u2191 (T\u03bb ). In\nparticular, each simple module L has a well-defined class in K0 (T\u03bb ) \u2297Z[q,q\u22121 ] Z((q)) \u001b\nV\u03bb .\nThis observation would be clear if T\u03bb were Morita equivalent to a positively\ngraded algebra. This case is called mixed by Achar and Stroppel [AS], and is\ncarefully worked out in their paper. As shown in [Webe, 4.6], this is true when\nk is characteristic 0, the Cartan matrix of g is symmetric, and polynomials Qij are\ncarefully chosen, but as the example [Weba, 5.6] shows, it can fail outside these\ncases. Thus, we instead prove this weaker result.\nProof. The proof is by induction on our order above. First, we do the base case of\n\u03bb\n\u03bb = (\u03bb) and \u03bb \u2212 \u03b1 = k\u03b1i . This case, T\u03b1 is Morita equivalent to its center, which is\nthe cohomology ring on a Grassmannian of k-planes in \u03bbi -dimensional space. In\nparticular, it is positively graded, so such a resolution exists.\nNow, we bootstrap to the case where \u03bb = (\u03bb) but \u03b1 is arbitrary. In this case, we\nmay assume that L\u2032 = \u1ebdai11 L has this type of resolution. Now, we consider\nM = Ind\u03b1+a1 \u03b1i1 ,ai \u03b1i1 L\u2032 \u22a0 L(ia11 ),\nwhere here we use the notation of [KL09, \u00a73.2]. The module M has a projective\nresolution of the prescribed type, by inducing the outer tensors of the resolutions\non the two factors. Furthermore, there is a surjection M \u0589 L whose kernel has\ncomposition factors smaller in the order given above on simples, by [KL09, Theorem\n3.7]. Since each of these has an appropriate resolution by induction, we may lift the\ninclusion of each composition factor to a map of projective resolutions, and take the\ncone to obtain a resolution of L in C\u2191 (T\u03bb ).\nFinally, we deal with the general case using standardization; let L = h({Li }). By\nstandardizing the resolutions of Li , we obtain a standard resolution of S\u03bb (L1 \u22a0* * *\u22a0Ll ).\nReplacing each standard with its finite projective resolution, we obtain a projective\nresolution of the same module. As before, the kernel of the surjection of this module\nto L has composition factors all smaller in the partial order, so we may attach\n46\n\n\fBen Webster\nprojective resolutions of each composition factor to obtain a projective resolution of\n\u0003\nL in C\u2191 (T\u03bb ).\n3.4. Standard stratification. Now, we proceed to showing that the algebra T\u03bb is\nstandardly stratified. Consider the set \u03a6 of permutations of the bottom ends of the\nstrands which only move black strands into blocks to their left and are minimal coset\nrepresentatives for the permutations of the strands at the top of the diagram. We\nfirst give these a partial order which only depends only on the resulting idempotent\nat the top of the diagram.\nSo, we first preorder \u03a6 according to this preorder on the idempotent (i\u03c6 , \u03ba\u03c6 ) which\nappears at the top of the diagram. Then within the permutations giving a single\nidempotent, we use the Bruhat order. Unlike the preorder above, this is a partial\norder.\n\nFigure 15. The element x\u03c6\nLet x\u03c6 be an element where we permute the strands exactly according to a chosen\nreduced word of \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6. Let\nP<\u03c6 = hx\u03c6\u2032 |\u03c6\u2032 < \u03c6i \u2282 P\u03bai\n\nP\u2264\u03c6 = hx\u03c6\u2032 |\u03c6\u2032 \u2264 \u03c6i \u2282 P\u03bai\n\nThe element x\u03c6 is not unique, since it depends on a choice of reduced word;\nhowever, any two choices differ by an element of L<\u03c6 , so the filtration described\nabove is unique.\n\u03ba\n\nProposition 3.18 P\u2264\u03c6 /P<\u03c6 \u001b Si\u03c6\u03c6 .\nWe note that some of these subquotients are trivial, but in this case the corresponding standard module is trivial as well.\n\u03ba\u03c6\n\nProof. Since this map is surjective, we have dim P\u2264\u03c6 /P<\u03c6 \u2264 dim Si\u03c6 . On the other\nP\n\u03ba\u03c6\nhand, we have v\u03bai = \u03c6\u2208\u03a6 q\u2212 deg x\u03c6 si\u03c6 , so taking inner product with [T\u03bb ], we obtain\nP\n\u03ba\u03c6\ndim P\u03bai = \u03c6\u2208\u03a6 dim Si\u03c6 .\nThus we must have equality above, and the map is an isomorphism for degree\nreasons.\n\u0003\n47\n\n\fKnot invariants and higher representation theory I\nCorollary 3.19 The algebra T\u03bb is standardly stratified with standard modules given\nby the standard quotients of indecomposable projectives, and the preorder on simples/standards/projectives given by the dominance order on root functions \u03b1.\nCorollary 3.20 Every standard module has a finite length projective resolution.\nThis is a standard fact about finite dimensional standardly stratified algebras; in\nparticular, any module with a standard filtration has a well-defined class in K0 (T\u03bb ).\nProof. First note that if a module M is filtered by modules which have finite length\nprojective resolutions, these resolutions can be glued to give a finite length resolution\nof the entire module.\nNow, we induct on the partial order \u2264. If a standard is maximal in this order, it\nis projective. For an arbitrary standard, there is a map Pi\u03ba \u2192 Si\u03ba with kernel filtered\nby standards higher in the partial order. Since each of these has a finite length\nprojective resolution, S\u03bai does as well.\n\u0003\nWe note that e(i, \u03ba)T\u03bb e(i, 0) has a unique element consisting of a diagram with no\ndots and no crossings between black strands which simply pulls red strands to the\nleft and black to the right. As before, we call this element \u03b8\u03ba (leaving i implicit).\nLemma 3.21 The map from P\u03bai \u2192 P0i given by the action of \u03b8\u03ba is injective.\nProof. Obviously, this map is filtered, where we include \u03a6i,\u03ba \u2282 \u03a6i,\u03ba by precomposing\nwith the permutation that pushes all black strands to the right. Furthermore, it\ninduces an isomorphism on each successive quotient in this image. Thus, it is\ninjective.\n\u0003\n\u03bb1\n\u03bbl\n\u2297 * * * \u2297 T\u03b1(l)\n-mod, and let C\u03b1 be the subcategory of modules\nWe let V\u03b1\u03bb1 ;...;\u03bbn = T\u03b1(1)\nwhich have a presentation by standard modules with root function \u03b1.\n\nProposition 3.22 We have a natural isomorphism\n\u03bb1\n\u03bbl\nEndT\u03bb (S\u03b1 ) \u001b T\u03b1(1)\n\u2297 * * * \u2297 T\u03b1(l)\n.\n\nIn particular, C\u03b1 is equivalent to V\u03b1\u03bb1 ;...;\u03bbn . The triangulated subcategories generated\n\u03bb\nby C\u03b1 form a semi-orthogonal decomposition of the derived category D+ (V\u03b1 ) with\nrespect to dominance order.\nProof. Since every standard with root function \u03b1 is a summand of S\u03b1 and S\u03b1 has\ntrivial higher Exts, it follows immediately that\nC\u03b1 \u001b Endop (S\u03b1 ) -mod .\nLet us calculate this endomorphism algebra. By the projective property, every\nendomorphism of S\u03b1 is induced by an endomorphism of e\u03b1 T\u03bb . Thus Endop (S\u03b1 ) is a\n48\n\n\fBen Webster\nsubquotient of e\u03b1 T\u03bb e\u03b1 . We take the quotient of the subalgebra which preserves the\nkernel of S\u03b1 by the ideal of those that send everything to that kernel.\nApply Proposition 2.5 in the case where each reduced word puts each group of\nblack strands and red immediately to its left in the correct order first, followed\nby a shortest coset representative for this Young subgroups. This implies that the\ndiagram from any permutation which has a left crossing has at least one before\nany right crossings. By the definition of the standard quotient such a diagram acts\ntrivially. On the other hand, an element of e\u03b1 T\u03bb e\u03b1 must have equal numbers of the\ntwo types of crossings, so our element can be \"straightened\" so that no red and\nblack strands ever cross. Thus, we have a surjective map from T\u0303\u03b1\u03bb1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 T\u0303\u03b1\u03bbl to\nEnd(S\u03b1 ).\nBy definition of a standard quotient, the cyclotomic ideal of this tensor product\n\u03bbl\n\u03bb1\n\u2192\nis killed by the map to Endop (S\u03b1 ), so we have a surjective map T\u03b1(1)\n\u2297 * * * \u2297 T\u03b1(l)\nop\n>0\nEnd (S\u03b1 ), which we need only show is also injective. Since Ext (S\u03b1 , S\u03b1 ) = 0, this is\nequivalent to showing that\n\u03bbl\n\u03bb1\n.\ndim End(S\u03b1 , S\u03b1 ) = h[S\u03b1 ], [S\u03b1 ]i1 = dim T\u03b1(1)\n\u2297 * * * \u2297 T\u03b1(l)\n\nThe second equality follows from the equality ha \u2297 b, a\u2032 \u2297 b\u2032 i = ha, biha\u2032 , b\u2032 i if a, a\u2032 and\nb, b\u2032 are weight vectors with each pair having the same weight, which follows, in\nturn, from the upper-triangularity of \u0398(2) .\nFinally, we establish the semi-orthogonal decomposition: by Proposition 3.18, the\n\u2032\nsubcategory generated by C\u03b1 for \u03b1\u2032 > \u03b1 in the dominance order is the same as that\ngenerated by P\u03bai such that \u03b1i,\u03ba > \u03b1. Since all the simple modules in S\u03bai are given by\nidempotents ei,\u03ba such that \u03b1i,\u03ba \u2264 \u03b1, we have\n\u2032\n\nExt\u2022 (S\u03bai\u2032 , S\u03bai ) = 0\nwhenever \u03b1i,\u03ba < \u03b1i\u2032 ,\u03ba\u2032 , and higher Ext's vanish when equality holds.\n\n\u0003\n\n3.5. Self-dual projectives. One interesting consequence of the module structure\nover U and standard stratification is the understanding it gives us of the self-dual\nprojectives of our category. Self-dual projectives have played a very important\nrole in understanding the structure of representation theoretic categories like V\u03bb .\nFor example, the unique self-dual projective in BGG category O for g was key\nin Soergel's analysis of that category [Soe90, Soe92], and the self-dual projectives\nin category O for a rational Cherednik algebra provide an important perspective\non the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov functor defined by Ginzburg, Guay, Opdam and\nRouquier [GGOR03]. In particular, as Mazorchuk and Stroppel show [MS08], these\nmodules also play an important role in the identification of the Serre functor; we\nwill apply their results to describe the Serre functor of the perfect derived category\nof T\u03bb -modules in the sequel [Webc] to this paper.\n49\n\n\fKnot invariants and higher representation theory I\nTheorem 3.23 If P is an indecomposable projective T\u03bb -module, then the following\nare equivalent:\n\n(1) P is injective.\n(2) P is a summand of the injective hull of an indecomposable standard module.\n(3) P is isomorphic (up to grading shift) to a summand of P0 .\nProof. (3) \u2192 (1): To establish this, we show that P0 is self-dual; that is, there is a\nnon-degenerate pairing P0i \u2297 P0i \u2192 k. This is given by (a, b) = \u03c4\u03bb (a\u1e03), where \u03c4\u03bb is the\nFrobenius trace on End(P0 ) \u001b T\u03bb given in Section 1.3. Thus P0 is both projective and\ninjective, so any summand of it is as well.\n(1) \u2192 (2): Since P is indecomposable and injective, it is the injective hull of any\nsubmodule of P. Since P has a standard stratification, it has a submodule which is\nstandard.\n(2) \u2192 (3): We have already established that P0 is injective, so we need only\nestablish that any simple in the socle of S\u03bai is a summand of the cosocle of P0 (since\nthe injective hull of S\u03bai coincides with that of its socle). It suffices to show that there\nis no non-trivial submodule of S\u03bai killed by e0,\u2217 . If such a submodule M existed, then\nwe would have M\u03b8 \u0307\u03ba = 0. Thus, its preimage M\u2032 in P\u03bai satisfies M\u2032 \u03b8 \u0307\u03ba \u2282 L0i . But\nthe injectivity of Lemma 3.21 and the fact that L\u03bai \u03b8 \u0307\u03ba = L0i \u2229 P\u03bai \u03b8 \u0307\u03ba , this implies that\nM = 0.\n\u0003\nFor two rings A and B, we say an A-B bimodule M has the double centralizer\nproperty if EndB (M) = A and EndA (M) = B. In particular, this implies that if M is\nprojective as a B-module, the functor\nHom(M, \u2212) : B -mod \u2192 A -mod\nis fully faithful on projectives (it could be quite far from being a Morita equivalence,\nas the theorem below shows).\nCorollary 3.24 The projective-injective P0 has the double centralizer property for\nthe actions of T\u03bb and T\u03bb on the left and right.\nProof. By [MS08, Corollary 2.6], this follows immediately from the fact that the\ninjective hull of an indecomposable standard is also a summand of P0 .\n\u0003\nThus, in this case, our algebra can be realized as the endomorphisms of a collection\nof modules over R\u03bb , in a way analogous to the realization of a regular block of\ncategory O as the modules over endomorphisms of a particular module over the\ncoinvariant algebra, or of the cyclotomic q-Schur algebra as the endomorphisms of\na module over the Hecke algebra.\n50\n\n\fBen Webster\nIn fact, these modules are easy to identify. Given (i, \u03ba), we consider the element\nyi,\u03ba of P0i given by\nl\nn\ni\nY\nY\n\u03bb jk\nyi,\u03ba = ei\nyk .\nj=1 k=\u03ba( j)+1\n\nPictorially this is given by multiplying the element with no black/black crossings\ngoing from (i, 0) to (i, \u03ba) (which we denote \u03b8\u03ba ) by its horizontal reflection \u03b8\u0307\u03ba , and\nthen straightening the strands.\n\u03b8\u03070,1,1,3\n\u03b80,1,1,3\n5\n\n\u03bb1 \u03bb2 \u03bb3 \u03bb4 1\n\n4\n\n2\n\nFigure 16. The element y(1,5,4,2),(0,1,1,3).\nL\nProposition 3.25 The algebra T\u03bb is isomorphic to the algebra EndT\u03bb ( \u03ba yi,\u03ba T\u03bb ).\n\nProof. Based on Corollary 3.24, all we need to show is that HomT\u03bb (P0 , P\u03bai ) \u001b yi,\u03ba P0i\nas a T\u03bb representation. A map m from P0i\u2032 to P\u03bai is simply a linear combination of\ndiagrams starting at i with the correct placement of red strands and ending at i\u2032\nwith all red strands to the right. By Proposition 2.5, we can assure that all red/black\ncrossings occur above all black/black ones, so m = \u03b8\u03ba m\u2032 , where m \u2208 T\u03bb .\nThus, we have maps\n\u03b8\u0307\u03ba\n\n\u03b8\u03ba\n\nHomT\u03bb (P0 , P0i ) \u2212\u2192 HomT\u03bb (P0 , P\u03bai ) \u2212\u2192 HomT\u03bb (P0 , P0i )\ngiven by composition. The first of these is surjective, as we argued above. Furthermore, the latter is injective, by Proposition 3.21. Thus, HomT\u03bb (P0 , P\u03bai ) is isomorphic\nto the image of the composition of these maps, which is yi,\u03ba T\u03bb .\n\u0003\nFor some choices of i and \u03ba, the element yi,\u03ba has already appeared in work of Hu\nand Mathas [HM10]. Assume that g = sln and specialize to the case where \u03bb j = \u03c9\u03c0 j\nfor some \u03c0 j . As suggested by the notation, we will later want to think of \u03c0 j as a composition. We can define stringy sequences for this algebra using the reduced decomposition of the longest element of the Weyl group w0 = sn\u22121 (sn\u22122 sn\u22121 ) * * * (s1 * * * sn\u22121 ).\nAs illustrated in Figure 17, the stringy sequences for the fundamental representation V\u03c9i are gotten by\n\u2022 taking a partition diagram which fits in an i \u00d7 (n \u2212 i) box,\n\u2022 filling it with its content, shifted so that the box (1, 1) is filled with i,\n51\n\n\fKnot invariants and higher representation theory I\n\n(4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 6)\n\n3\n\n1\n2\n\n6\n\n4\n3\n\n5\n4\n\nFigure 17. The stringy sequence attached to a partition for n = 7 and\ni = 4.\n\u2022 taking the row-reading word.\n\nFor a multipartition \u03be = (\u03be(1) , . . . , \u03be(l)), with \u03be(i) fitting in a \u03c0i \u00d7 (n \u2212 \u03c0i ) box, we can\nthus define (i\u03be , \u03ba\u03be ) where i\u03be is the concatenation of these row-reading words, and\n\u03ba\u03be (k) is the number of the boxes in the first k \u2212 1 partitions. The element yi\u03be ,\u03ba\u03be is\nexactly that denoted \u03c8t\u03be t\u03be in [HM10, HM].\nMathas and Hu have defined another algebra, which they call a quiver Schur\nalgebra2 S\u03bbm .\nTheorem 3.26 For g = sln , the category V\u03bb is equivalent (as a graded category) to a\nsum of blocks of graded representations of S\u03bbm for the charges (\u03c01 , . . . , \u03c0l ).\nIf we considered the case where g = sl\u221e (thought of as the Kac-Moody algebra of\nthe A\u221e -quiver), then we could say that V\u03bb is simply equivalent to \u2295m S\u03bbm -mod.\nProof. By [HM, 4.35], the graded category of projectives in a block of Mathas and\nHu's algebra is equivalent to an additive subcategory of T\u03bb -mod. By Proposition\n3.25, the graded category of projectives in each weight space of V\u03bb is also equivalent to such a subcategory. Thus, we need only show that we can match these\nsubcategories coincide.\nEach block of S\u03bbm is the sum of images of the idempotents e(i) where i ranges over\nall integer sequences with a fixed number mi of occurrences of i. As long as only\nnumbers between 1 and n \u2212 1 appear, we can associate to this multiplicity data a\nP\n\u03bb\nweight \u03bc = \u03bb \u2212 i mi \u03b1i . We wish to show that this block is equivalent to V\u03bc . Let\nP\nm = mi .\nThe image of projective modules over S\u03bbm is the subcategory additively generated\nby \u03c8t\u03be t\u03be T\u03bb = yi\u03be ,\u03ba\u03be T\u03bb as we range over all multipartitions with m boxes fitting inside\n2\n\nThis is an unfortunate terminological clash with [SW], where a non-equivalent, but graded Morita\nequivalent algebra is given the same name; after forgetting the grading, this is the difference between\ndefining Schur algebras using all permutation modules attached to partitions or to compositions.\n\n52\n\n\fBen Webster\n\u03ba\n\nthe correct \u03c0i \u00d7 (n \u2212 \u03c0i ) boxes. These are the same as the images of the projectives Pi\u03be\u03be\nunder the functor Hom(P0 , \u2212). By Proposition 3.15, every indecomposable projective\n\u03bb\nover T\u03bc is a summand of a unique one of these modules, so those which have weight\n\u03bb\n\u03bc already additively generate the image of the T\u03bc -pmod in T\u03bc\u03bb -mod. Thus, that\nimage coincides with the corresponding image for the quiver Schur algebra.\n\u0003\n4. Comparison to category O\n4.1. Cyclotomic degenerate Hecke algebras. Now, we specialize to the case where\ng \u001b sln . In this case, we can reinterpret our results in terms of the work of Brundan\nand Kleshchev [BK08, BK09] who have shown that in this case, the cyclotomic\nKhovanov-Lauda algebra is a cyclotomic degenerate affine Hecke algebra (cdAHA).\nRecall that the degenerate affine Hecke algebra (dAHA) is the algebra with generators x1 , . . . , xd and w \u2208 Sd such that\nsi x j = xsi * j si \u2212 \u03b4 j,i + \u03b4 j,i+1\n\nxi x j = x j xi\n\nfor the simple reflections in si \u2208 Sd and the usual relations between permutations.\nWe have a natural action of Hd on the glN module P\u2297V \u2297d for any gln representation\nP, where V = CN is the defining representation of glN :\n\u2022 Sd acts on the d copies of V, and\n\u2022 x1 acts by C \u2297 1\u2297d\u22121 where C is the Casimir element of glN .\n\nWe will be most interested in the case where P is a certain parabolic Verma module\nfor a parabolic p; in this case, by the definition of induction,\nP \u2297 V \u2297d \u001b U(gln ) \u2297U(p) (W \u2297 V \u2297d )\nfor a finite dimensional representation W of p.\nDefinition 4.1 Parabolic category O, which we denote Op , is the full subcategory of\nglN -modules with a weight decomposition where p acts locally finitely.\nSince induction sends finite-dimensional modules to p-locally finite modules,\nP \u2297 V \u2297d lies in this category.\nAttached to each parabolic p \u2282 glN , we have a unique composition \u03c0 = (\u03c01 , . . . , \u03c0l )\nsuch that p is conjugate to block-diagonal matrices for this composition (the composition \u03c0 can be recovered as the gaps in the finest flag p preserves). These can be\nP\nused to define a weight \u03bb = i \u03c9\u03c0i \u2208 Y(g); that is, \u03bb j = #{i|\u03c0i = j}.\nDefinition 4.2 The cyclotomic degenerate affine Hecke algebra is the quotient of\nthe dAHA given by\nn\nM\nDY\nE\ni\n\u03bb\nH =\nHd /\n(x1 \u2212 i)\u03bb .\ni=1\n\nd\u22650\n\n53\n\n\fKnot invariants and higher representation theory I\nThis has a natural system of orthogonal idempotents ed for all d \u2265 0 which project\nto the image of Hd . Brundan and Kleshchev show that when P is the parabolic Verma\nmodule associated to the \"ground state\" tableau on \u03c0, then the action of dAHA on\nP \u2297 V \u2297d factors through its cyclotomic quotient.\nThus, we have a functor HomglN (P \u2297 V \u2297d , \u2212) : Op \u2192 H\u03bb -mod. This functor is\nvery far from being an equivalence, but on each block of Op it is either 0, or fully\nfaithful on projectives. Thus, certain blocks of Op can be described in terms of\nendomorphism rings of modules over H\u03bb .\nIn [BK09], Brundan and Kleshchev show that each category V\u03bb\u03bc is equivalent to\na block of the representations of H\u03bb . Thus, using this isomorphism, we can also\n\u03bb\nexpress V\u03bc in terms of endomorphisms of modules over H\u03bb .\nThere is an idempotent of Hd associated to any length d sequence of integers. We\nlet eg be the sum of these idempotents corresponding to sequences of integers in\n[1, n]. In this section, we use the polynomials Qij as defined in the previous section\nfor a fixed orientation of the type A (or later, affine type A) quiver. The most obvious\nchoice is\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n1\ni, j\u00b11\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nQij (u, v) = \uf8f4\nu\u2212v i= j+1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3v \u2212 u i = j \u2212 1\ndef\n\nProposition 4.3 ([BK09]) There is an isomorphism \u03a5 : T\u03bb \u2192 eg H\u03bb eg = H\u03bb,n .\n\nUnder this map, we have that \u03a5(y j e(i)) = e(i)(x j \u2212 i j ), and \u03a5\u22121 (Ti ) is in a linear\ncombination of yai ybi+1 \u03c8i e(i) and yai ybi+1 e(i) by [BK09, (3.41-42)].\n4.2. Comparison of categories. First, let us endeavor to understand how we can\ntranslate the T\u03bb -modules yi,\u03ba T\u03bb defined in Section 2.4 into the language of the cdAHA\nusing \u03a5. It's immediate from Proposition 4.3 that\n\u03a5(yi,\u03ba ) = e(i)\n\nl\nn\nY\nY\n\nj=1 k=\u03ba( j)+1\n\ni\n\n\u03bbk\n\n(xk \u2212 ik ) j .\n\nHowever, the strong dependence of this element on e(i) makes it problematic for\nuse in the Hecke algebra.\nWe first specialize to the case where \u03bb j = \u03c9\u03c0 j for some \u03c0 j . As suggested by the\nnotation, we will later want to think of \u03c0 j as a composition. This bit of notation\nallows us to associate to each \u03ba an element of H\u03bb,n (note that there is no dependence\non i):\n(4.5)\n\n\u03ba( j)\nl Y\nY\n(xk \u2212 \u03c0 j )\nz\u03ba =\nj=1 k=1\n\n54\n\n\fBen Webster\nWe let M\u03bai = e(i)z\u03ba H\u03bb,n and M\u03ba = z\u03ba H\u03bb,n .\nProposition 4.4 For all i, we have yi,\u03ba H\u03bb,n = M\u03bai . In particular, we have an isomorphism T\u03bb \u001b End(\u2295\u03ba M\u03ba ).\nProof. If a , i j , then we can rewrite e(i) as\n\u0013\n\u0012\nxj \u2212 ij\n(x j \u2212 i j)2\n\u22121\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212 ***\ne(i) = (x j \u2212 a)e(i)\na \u2212 i j (a \u2212 i j )2\n(a \u2212 i j )3\n\nsince (x j \u2212 i j)e(i) is nilpotent. It follows that\n(4.6)\n\ni\n\n\u03bbk\n\ne(i)(xk \u2212 \u03c0 j )H\u03bb,n = e(i)(xk \u2212 ik ) j H\u03bb,n\n\nsince \u03bbijk = \u03b4\u03c0 j ,ik . Thus, applying (4.6) to each term in z\u03ba , the result follows.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe note that the modules M\u03ba are closely related to the permutation modules\ndiscussed by Brundan and Kleshchev in [BK08, \u00a76]. Each way of filling \u03c0 as a\ntableau such that the column sums are \u03ba(i) \u2212 \u03ba(i \u2212 1) results in a permutation module\nwhich is a summand of M\u03ba .\nNow we wish to understand how the modules M\u03ba are related to parabolic category\nP\nO. Let N = j \u03c0 j be the number of boxes in \u03c0. As before, the \u03c0i give a composition\nof N, and thus a parabolic subgroup p \u2282 glN , which is precisely the operators\npreserving a flag V1 \u2282 V2 \u2282 * * * \u2282 V. If, as usual, \u03ba is a weakly increasing function\non [1, l] with non-negative integer values and further \u03ba(l) \u2264 d, then we let\nV\u03bad = V1\u2297\u03ba(1) \u2297 V2\u2297\u03ba(2)\u2212\u03ba(1) \u2297 * * * \u2297 V d\u2212\u03ba(l)\n\nas a p-representation. We can induce this representation to an object in Op which\nwe denote\nP\u03bad \u001b U(gln ) \u2297U(p) (C\u2212\u03c1 \u2297 V\u03bad ),\n\nwhere C\u2212\u03c1 is the 1-dimensional p-module defined in [BK08, pg. 4].\nAll the objects P\u03bad live in the subcategory we denote Op>0 which is generated by all\nparabolic Verma modules whose corresponding tableau has positive integer entries.\nWe also consider a much smaller subcategory which has only finitely many simple\nobjects: let Opn be the subcategory of Op generated by all parabolic Vermas whose\ncorresponding tableau only uses the integers [1, n]. Let prn : Op \u2192 Opn be the\nprojection to this subcategory (Opn is a sum of blocks, so there is a unique projection).\nProposition 4.5 If one ranges over all \u03ba and all integers d, then \u2295\u03ba,d V\u03bad is a projective\ngenerator for Op>0 .\nProof. This follows from a simple modification of the proof of [BK08, Theorem 4.14].\n\u2212\nIn the notation of that proof, we have that P\u03bad \u001b R(P\u03ba\u03ba(l) \u2297 C\u2212\u03c1 ) \u2297 V \u2297d\u2212\u03ba(l) , where \u03ba\u2212\nis the restriction of \u03ba to [1, l \u2212 1]. As noted in that proof, by induction, this is two\n55\n\n\fKnot invariants and higher representation theory I\nfunctors which preserve projective modules applied to a projective module; thus P\u03bad\nis projective.\nEach of Brundan and Kleshchev's divided power modules is a summand in one of\nthe P\u03bad , as we noted earlier. Since any indecomposable projective of Op is a summand\n\u0003\nof a divided power module, the same is true of the P\u03bad 's.\nProposition 4.6 For all d, \u03ba, we have\nz\u03ba H\u03bb ed \u001b Hom(P \u2297 V \u2297d , Pd\u03ba )\n\nM\u03ba ed \u001b Hom(P \u2297 V \u2297d , prn (Pd\u03ba )).\n\nProof. This rests on a single computation, which is that the image in P \u2297 V of the\nQ\naction of li=j+1 (x1 \u2212 \u03c0i ) is\nU(gln ) \u2297U(p) (C\u2212\u03c1 \u2297 V j ) \u2282 U(gln ) \u2297U(p) (C\u2212\u03c1 \u2297 V) \u001b P \u2297 V;\n\nthis follows from [BK08, Lemma 3.3]. This shows that the image of z\u03ba acting on\nP \u2297 V \u2297d is Pd\u03ba , so by the projectivity of P \u2297 V \u2297d , every homomorphism to Pd\u03ba factors\nthrough this one.\nWe can identify those homomorphisms whose image is in prn (Pd\u03ba ) \u2282 Pd\u03ba as those\nQ\nkilled by some power of \u03c7nj = ni=1 (x j \u2212 i) for each j (if a number m appears in a\ntableau, then x j \u2212 m is nilpotent for some j, and so if m < [1, n], then \u03c7nj is invertible\nfor that j). Thus, this homomorphism space is the subspace of z\u03ba H\u03bb ed on which all\n\u03c7nj act nilpotently, which is precisely M\u03ba ed .\n\u0003\n\u001b\n\nCorollary 4.7 We have an equivalence \u039e : V\u03bb \u2212\u2192 Opn .\nWe can generalize this statement a bit further: let us now consider the case where\nthe weights \u03bbi are not fundamental. In this case, to each weight \u03bbi we have a unique\nYoung diagram given by writing it as a sum of fundamental weights, and we obtain\na pyramid \u03c0 by concatenating these horizontally (this is the pyramid associated\nearlier to the refinement of \u03bb into fundamental weights). We associate a parabolic p\nwith the pyramid as before.\nFor each collection of semi-standard3 tableaux Ti on each of these diagrams which\nonly use the integers [1, n], this gives a tableau on \u03c0 (now just column-strict). Such\nP\na tableau can be converted into a module in Op for glN (where N = \u03c0i ) by taking\nthe projective cover of the p-parabolic Verma module corresponding to this tableau.\nLet Op\u03bb be the subcategory of modules presented by these projectives.\nProposition 4.8 The functor \u039e induces an equivalence of Op\u03bb and V\u03bb .\n3\n\nIn [BK08], these are called \"standard.\"\n\n56\n\n\fBen Webster\nProof. What is clear from Corollary 4.7 is that V\u03bb is equivalent to the subcategory\nof Op\u03bb consisting of objects presented by projectives prn (Pd\u03ba ) for the sequence of\nweights obtained by breaking \u03bb into fundamental weights, where we require \u03ba to\nbe constant on the blocks of fundamental weights obtained by breaking up \u03bbi . In\nterms of category O, we only induce finite-dimensional p vector spaces obtained by\ntensoring the vector spaces which appear in a particular flag preserved by p, the\ngaps of which encode the sequence \u03bb.\nThat is, the indecomposable projectives of V\u03bb are sent to the indecomposable\nprojectives which appear as summands of these prn (P\u03bad ). Thus these are in bijection,\nand there can only be dim V\u03bb of the latter. Since there is exactly that number of\ntableaux which are semi-standard in blocks as described above, we need only show\nthat these occur as summands.\nThis follows from the relationship between the crystal structure on tableaux and\nprojectives in category O. Specifically, since any tableau which is semi-standard in\nblocks can be obtained from the empty tableau by the operations of attaching a fresh\nYoung diagram filled with the ground state tableau and of applying crystal operators,\nthe argument from [BK08, Corollary 4.6] shows that the projective corresponding to\nsuch a tableau is a summand of an appropriate P\u03bad .\n\u0003\nWe note that this shows that our categorification corresponds to that for twice\nfundamental weights of sln recently given by Hill and Sussan [HS].\nThe category Op has a natural endofunctor given by tensoring with V. Restricting\nto Opn , we can take the functor f\u2022 = prn (\u2212 \u2297 V). This functor has a natural decomposition f\u2022 = \u2295ni=1 fi in terms of the generalized eigenspaces of x1 acting on \u2212 \u2297 V; we\nneed only take i \u2208 [0, n] since these are the only eigenvalues of x1 on the projection\nto Opn .\nProposition 4.9 We have a commutative diagram\nOpn\n\nfi\n\n\u039e\nV\u03bb\n\nOpn\n\u039e\n\nFi\n\nV\u03bb\n\n\u03bb,n\nProof. The functor f\u2022 corresponds to tensoring a Hd\u03bb,n -module with Hd+1\n. By Proposi\u03bb\n\u03bb\ntion 4.3, this corresponds to tensoring over T\u03bc with \u2295i T\u03bc\u2212\u03b1i via the map \u2295\u03bdi . This is,\nof course, the functor \u2295ni=1 Fi . Via Brundan and Kleshchev's isomorphism, xn acts on\nFi M for any M by yn + i; that is, xn \u2212 i acts invertibly on F jM for j , i and nilpotently\non Fi M. This shows the desired isomorphism.\n\u0003\n\n57\n\n\fKnot invariants and higher representation theory I\nFor any parabolic subalgebra q \u2283 p with Levi l = q/rad q, we have an induction\nfunctor\nde f\nN\n= U(glN ) \u2297U(q) \u2212 : Op (l) \u2192 Op\nindgl\nl\n\nwhere Op (l) denotes the parabolic category O for l and the parabolic p/rad q (here\nl-representations are considered as q representations by pullback).\nChoices of q are in bijection with partitions of \u03bb into consecutive blocks \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbk .\nLet \u039el : V\u03bb1 ;...;\u03bbk \u2192 Op (l) be the comparison functor analogous to \u039e for l.\nProposition 4.10 We have a commutative diagram\nOpn (l)\n\nN\nindgl\nl\n\n\u039el\n\nOpn\n\u039e\n\nV\u03bb1 ;...;\u03bbk\n\nS\u03bb1 ,...,\u03bbk\n\nV\u03bb\n\nProof. We know that both functors are exact, by Proposition 3.9; thus need only check\nthis on projectives. Consider a representation of l given by an exterior product of\nprojectives in category O for each of its gl j -factors\nN\nindgl\nl\n\nP = P1 \u22a0 * * * \u22a0 Pk .\n\nThen the induction\nP is a quotient of the projective P\u2032 corresponding to the\nconcatenation T of the tableaux Ti for the Pi . The kernel is the image of all maps\nfrom projectives higher than T in Bruhat order through a series of transpositions\nwhich change the content of at least one of the Ti .\n(P)) is a quotient of \u039e\u22121 (P\u2032 ); the kernel is\nSimilarly, the standardization S\u03bb1 ;...;\u03bbk (\u039e\u22121\nl\nthe image of all maps from projectives that correspond to idempotents for sequences\nwhere at least one black strand has been moved left from one block to the other. Thus,\nthese functors agree on the level of projective objects.\nNow, we must show that they agree on morphisms; that is, we must show that\nN\nthe action of T\u03bb1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 T\u03bbk induced on indgl\n(\u039e(T\u03bb1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 T\u03bbk )) agrees with that\nl\non \u039e(S\u03bb1 ,...,\u03bbk (T\u03bb1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 T\u03bbk )) under an isomorphism between these objects. Since\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nT\u03b111 \u2297* * *\u2297T\u03b1kk is the full-endomorphism algebra of S\u03b1 , it is also the full endomorphism\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nN\nalgebra of \u039e(S\u03b1 ). Thus, in fact, any isomorphism \u039e(S\u03b1 ) \u001b indgl\n(\u039e(T\u03b111 \u2297 * * * \u2297 T\u03b1kk ))\nl\ninduces an isomorphism of functors.\n\u0003\nSome care is required here on the subject of gradings. Brundan and Kleshchev's\nresults relating category O to Khovanov-Lauda algebras are ungraded; they imply\nno connection between the usual graded lift of \u00d5p of category O and the graded\ncategory of modules over T\u03bb . Luckily, the uniqueness of Koszul gradings proven\n58\n\n\fBen Webster\nin [BGS96, 2.5.2] implies that any Morita equivalence between two Koszul graded\nalgebras can be lifted to a graded equivalence.\nThere are now two proofs in the literature that these algebras are Koszul for in the\ntype A case. Hu and Mathas have shown that their quiver Schur algebra is Koszul\n[HM, Th. C]; thus, we may use the Morita equivalence of Theorem 3.26 to transport\nthis result to T\u03bb . The author has also given a direct geometric proof in [Webd, Th.\n1], by directly constructing a graded isomorphism of T\u03bb with an Ext-algebra in the\nKoszul dual of Opn .\nProposition 4.11 When g = sln and \u03bb is a list of fundamental weights, the algebra\n\u03bb\nT\u03bc is Koszul.\nCorollary 4.12 The equivalence \u039e has a graded lift.\nWe note that both the action of projective functors and of the induction functors\nhave graded lifts which are unique up to grading shift, and thus are determined by\ntheir action on the Grothendieck group. Thus the graded lifts given by the action of\nU and S agree, up to an easily understood shift, with those used in other papers on\ngraded category O (most importantly for us, this is used in the work of MazorchukStroppel [MS08] and Sussan [Sus07] on link homologies, which we address in this\npaper's sequel [Webc]).\n4.3. The affine case. We note that the constructions of the previous subsection generalize in an absolutely straightforward way to the affine case by simply replacing\nthe results of Section 3 of [BK09] with Section 4.\nWe let \u0124d denote the affine Hecke algebra (not the degenerate one we considered\nearlier). Fix an element \u03b6 \u2208 k, the separable algebraic closure of k such that\n1 + \u03b6 + \u03b62 + * * * + \u03b6n\u22121 = 0,\n\nand n is smallest integer for which this holds (for example, if k is characteristic 0,\nthese means that \u03b6 is a primitive nth root of unity). The cyclotomic affine Hecke\nalgebra or Ariki-Koike algebra (introduced in [AK94]) for \u03bb is the quotient\nM\n\u2228\n\u03bb\n\u0124 =\n\u0124d /h(x1 \u2212 \u03b6i )\u03b1i (\u03bb) i.\nd\n\nwhere we adopt the slightly strange convention that if \u03b6 \u2208 Z, then \u03b6i = \u03b6 + i, and\notherwise it is the usual power operation.\nsln , there is an isomorphism T\u03bb \u001b\nTheorem 4.13 ([BK09, Main Theorem]) When g \u001b b\n\u0124\u03bb .\nThis symmetric Frobenius algebra has a natural quasi-hereditary cover, called\nthe cyclotomic q-Schur algebra, defined by Dipper, James and Mathas [DJM98].\n59\n\n\fKnot invariants and higher representation theory I\nIndecomposable projectives over this algebra are indexed by ordered k =\ntuples of partitions.\n\nPn\n\ni=0\n\n\u03b1\u2228i (\u03bb)-\n\nsln , then V\u03bb is equivalent to the subcategory of represenProposition 4.14 When g = b\ntations of the cyclotomic q-Schur algebra consisting of objects presented by certain\nprojective modules.\nIf all \u03bbi are fundamental, then these are exactly the projectives for the multipartitions where each constituent partitions are n-regular.\nIn general, we break the multipartition into smaller ones consisting of the first k1 =\nPn \u2228\ni=0 \u03b1i (\u03bb1 ) partitions, the next k2 , etc, and take the projectives for multipartitions\nwhere each of these smaller multi-partitions is n-Kleshchev.\nProof. By Corollary 3.24, T\u03bb is the endomorphism algebra of certain modules over\nT\u03bb , which one can see by the same arguments as Proposition 4.6 are of the form \u1e91\u03bb T\u0302\u03bb\nwhere\n\u03ba( j)\nl Y\nY\n(xk \u2212 \u03b6\u03c0 j ).\n\u1e91\u03ba =\nj=1 k=1\n\nThese are permutation modules for the Ariki-Koike algebra, exactly those corresponding to multi-partitions where all constituent partitions have all parts size 1.\nThus, in the case where all \u03bb's are fundamental, the category of modules over T\u03bb is\nthe subcategory of representations of the cyclotomic q-Schur algebra generated by\nsummands of these, and in the case where not all representations are fundamental,\nwe must restrict these projectives further.\nThe descriptions above follow from the fact that for the permutation module\nof the multipartition where all parts are 0 except for the last, which has all parts\n1, the indecomposable projectives which appear are exactly those for n-Kleshchev\nmultipartitions.\n\u0003\nThus, our categorification can be seen a generalization of the Ariki categorification theorem [Ari96]. As mentioned in the introduction, the author and Stroppel\naddress the question of how to describe the entirety of the cyclotomic q-Schur algebra diagrammatically in [SW].\nReferences\n[AK94]\n\n[Ari96]\n[AS]\n\nSusumu Ariki and Kazuhiko Koike, A Hecke algebra of (Z/rZ) \u2240 Sn and construction of\nits irreducible representations, Adv.
