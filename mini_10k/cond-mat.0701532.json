We want to find out if making a CNOT in such systems\ncan, at least theoretically, be reduced to a simple push of a button. Once initially set, the system\nitself would then take care of the needed gate by freely evolving from the identity of the unitary group\nto the target along the corresponding geodesic.\nWe thus approach the subject of time-control from the \"opposite\", non-optimal end. The plugand-play implementations considered in this paper may be useful for simple gate designs which do\nnot rely on sophisticated time-control of their physical parameters. The question of simplicity will\nalso become important once the best qubit is identified, and put together with thousands of others to\nform an integrated circuit. Optimally controlling [1] qubits in such a circuit would become a difficult\ntask, potentially leading to a compromise between the optimal and the simple. Thus, in this paper we\nlimit our attention mostly to time-independent Hamiltonians. The only place where time dependence\nnecessarily arises is in the analysis of fidelity degradation due to switching to resonance, considered\nin Section 6.\nTwo important developments motivated our work. The first was a series of experiments [2, 3, 4]\nwhich showed that the macroscopic quantum states [5, 6] of Josephson junctions have coherence times\nlong enough for such states to be used as qubits. That led to our choice of the physical Hamiltonians.\nThe other development was the work on the Weyl chamber steering method [7, 8] in which several\nexamples of direct generation of various important gates, including CNOT, was considered from a\npurely geometrical standpoint.\nIn what follows we will use the square brackets [* * *] to denote the gate - a representative of a\ngiven local class - located in a Weyl chamber.\n\n2\n\nThe concept of local equivalence\n\nWe begin by recalling the notion of local equivalence within the special unitary group SU (4). Two\ngates U1 , V1 \u2208 SU (4) are locally equivalent if they differ only by local transformations:\nU1 \u223c V1 \u21d0\u21d2 U1 = k1 V1 k2 ,\n\nk1 , k2 \u2208 SU (2) \u2297 SU (2).\n\n(1)\n\nIt is obvious that local equivalence is an example of equivalence relation: it is reflexive (U \u223c U ),\nsymmetric (U \u223c V \u21d0\u21d2 V \u223c U ), and transitive (U \u223c V, V \u223c W =\u21d2 U \u223c W ). When an equivalence\nrelation is given on a set, it partitions the set into disjoint classes. Thus the entire group SU (4) is\npartitioned into classes of locally equivalent elements; any such element (a two qubit gate) belongs to\none and only one local equivalence class.\nTo generalize the concept of local equivalence to the full U (4) we use the fact that any U \u2208 U (4) can\nbe written in the form U = ei \u03b1 U1 , with U1 \u2208 SU (4) (even though, as groups, U (4) 6= U (1) \u2297 SU (4)).\nThen two gates U = ei \u03b1 U1 , V = ei \u03b2 V1 \u2208 U (4) are locally equivalent if their representatives in SU (4)\nare equivalent:\nU \u223c V \u21d0\u21d2 U1 \u223c V1 .\n(2)\nOne way to represent local classes in SU (4) is with the help of a Cartan decomposition of the\nunderlying Lie algebra L = su(4). This can be seen as follows:\nFor any semi-simple Lie algebra L, its Cartan decomposition is a direct sum of two subspaces\nL = K \u2295 P , one of which, K, is itself a Lie algebra, [K, K] \u2282 K, and the other, P , satisfies\n\n2\n\n\f[P, P ] \u2282 K, [P, K] \u2282 P . Because K \u2229 P = 0, any subalgebra A \u2282 P must necessarily be abelian.\nSuch maximal abelian subalgebra AC \u2282 P is called the Cartan subalgebra of L relative to the given\nCartan decomposition. An important Cartan decomposition theorem (for groups) states that if a\nsemisimple algebra L has decomposition L = K \u2295 P , then any element U1 \u2208 exp L can always be\nwritten in the form\nU1 = k1 V1 k2 ,\n(3)\nwhere V1 \u2208 exp AC , and k1 , k2 \u2208 exp K.\nAn example of a Cartan decomposition is provided by su(2), for which we can take K = span{ 2i \u03c3z },\nP = span{ 2i \u03c3x , 2i \u03c3y }, and AC = span{ 2i \u03c3x }.\nCartan decompositions of su(4) are more complicated, but a special choice [1] of K spanned by\nthe local operators\ni\nX1 = \u03c3x1 ,\n2\n\ni\nY1 = \u03c3y1 ,\n2\n\ni\nZ1 = \u03c3z1 ,\n2\n\ni\nX2 = \u03c3x2 ,\n2\n\ni\nY2 = \u03c3y2 ,\n2\n\ni\nZ2 = \u03c3z2 ,\n2\n\n(4)\n\nand P spanned by all nonlocal operators 2i \u03c3\u03b11 \u03c3\u03b22 (\u03b1, \u03b2 = x, y, z) is particularly useful. If we now take\nthe span of mutually commuting operators\nXX =\n\ni 1 2\n\u03c3 \u03c3 ,\n2 x x\n\nYY =\n\ni 1 2\n\u03c3 \u03c3 ,\n2 y y\n\nZZ =\n\ni 1 2\n\u03c3 \u03c3\n2 z z\n\n(5)\n\nto serve as AC , the Cartan decomposition theorem applied to SU (4) = exp[su(4)] gives\nU1 = k1 exp (c1 XX + c2 Y Y + c3 ZZ) k2 .\n\n(6)\n\nThis results in a convenient representation of SU (4) local equivalence classes by the class vectors\n[c1 , c2 , c3 ] \u2208 AC . Representation of the U (4) classes is up-to-phase the same,\nU = ei \u03b1 k1 exp (c1 XX + c2 Y Y + c3 ZZ) k2 .\n\n(7)\n\nThe correspondence between class vectors and equivalence classes is not one-to-one: there are\ncertain symmetries which map class vectors to other class vectors of the same equivalence class.\nHowever it was shown in [7] that the correspondence can be made unique by restricting class vectors\nto a tetrahedral region in AC , called a Weyl chamber. One such chamber, denoted by a+ , is chosen\nto be canonical - it is described by the following three conditions [7, 9]:\n\u2022 \u03c0 > c1 \u2265 c2 \u2265 c3 \u2265 0,\n\n\u2022 c1 + c2 \u2264 \u03c0,\n\n\u2022 if c3 = 0, then c1 \u2264 \u03c0/2.\n\nEven though the choice of the Weyl chamber is not unique, when fixed, it becomes a powerful tool for\nanalyzing time evolution on the full U (4).\nIn the original papers on the subject [7, 8], several implementations of various useful gates by\nsteering on a+ have been demonstrated. Of particular interest to us is the way [CNOT] = [\u03c0/2, 0, 0] \u2208\na+ was generated by a single application of Hamiltonians with controllable Ising type interaction, such\nas\nHyy = \u03a91x \u03c3x1 + \u03a92x \u03c3x2 + \u03a91z \u03c3z1 + \u03a92z \u03c3z2 + g\u03c3y1 \u03c3y2 ,\n(8)\nand similarly for Hxx , Hzz . In [7, 8], the local invariants of the corresponding unitary evolution U (t) =\nexp(iHyy t) were first found in closed analytic form. Numerical analysis then produced the values for\nthe time and the coupling constants needed to achieve a perfect [CNOT] in just one application. The\n\n3\n\n\fyy and zz cases are particularly interesting because their interaction parts (when viewed as elements\nof AC ) point in the direction \"perpendicular\" to [CNOT].\nLet us now turn to Hamiltonians used to describe coupled superconducting qubits. Such Hamiltonians may contain several Ising terms, which we choose to be fixed by architecture (cf. [10, 11]). Our\ngoal is to find out if they are also capable of generating [CNOT] in a single application, and if so, how\nmany Rabi terms are required in order for such generation to be successful.\n\n3\n\nHamiltonians for coupled superconducting qubits\n\nWhen restricted to the two-qubit subspace, the Hamiltonian for two capacitively coupled phase qubits\ndriven by rf-pulses is given by\nHfast = \u2212\n|\n\n2\nX\n\u03c9i\ni=1\n\n2\n\n{z\n\nH0\n\n\u03c3zi +\n}\n\n2\nX\n\ni\n\u03a9i cos(\u03c9rf\nt + \u03b4i )\u03c3xi + g\u03c3y1 \u03c3y2 ,\n\ni=1\n\n{z\n\n|\n\nV\n\ng > 0.\n\n(9)\n\n}\n\nThe level spacings \u03c9i are tunable between about 7 to 10 GHz. The Rabi frequencies \u03a9i and the phases\n\u03b4i are fully controllable.\nAs it stands, this Hamiltonian is not suitable for actual gate implementations because of the very\nsmall time scale (tsc \u223c 0.1 ns) associated with \u03c9i . The scale roughly corresponds to the time it takes\nto make a \"round trip\" on SU (4) when going in the direction of \u2212iH \u2208 su(4). To attain high fidelity\nof the gate we would have to control the pulses with accuracy which is experimentally unattainable.\nTo avoid this problem, the rotating wave approximation (RWA) is used. We set the frequency of\ni = \u03c9 \u2261 \u03c9,\nthe external pulse to be equal to the transition frequency of the system (resonance), \u03c9rf\ni\nbring the phases to zero, and work in the interaction picture, in which the time evolution is governed\nby\nH = eiH0 t V e\u2212iH0 t\n=\n\n2\nX\ni=1\n\n\u0014\n\n\u03a9i cos\n\n2\n\n(\u03c9t)\u03c3xi\n\n\u0015\n\nh\nih\ni\nsin(2\u03c9t) i\n\u03c3y + g cos(\u03c9t)\u03c3y1 \u2212 sin(\u03c9t)\u03c3x1 cos(\u03c9t)\u03c3y2 \u2212 sin(\u03c9t)\u03c3x2 .\n+\n2\n\n(10)\n\nAfter averaging over fast oscillations the Hamiltonian becomes\nH=\n\n\u0011\n\u03a91 1 \u03a92 2 g \u0010 1 2\n\u03c3x +\n\u03c3x +\n\u03c3x \u03c3x + \u03c3y1 \u03c3y2 ,\n2\n2\n2\n\n(11)\n\nor in the language of Lie algebra su(4),\n\u2212iHt = \u2212t [\u03a91 X1 + \u03a92 X2 + g (XX + Y Y )] .\n\n(12)\n\nThere is an interesting modification of this qubit architecture based on inductive coupling between\nthe qubits (see Appendix). In that case an additional coupling constant k is introduced resulting in\nthe full Hamiltonian\n\u2212iHt = \u2212t [\u03a91 X1 + \u03a92 X2 + g (XX + Y Y + kZZ)] .\n\n4\n\n(13)\n\n\f4 Implementing [CNOT] by time-independent Hamiltonians\n4.1\n\nThe XX + Y Y case\n\nHere we show how to implement the perfect [CNOT] by a single application of the experimentally\navailable Hamiltonian (12) with one Rabi term\n\u2212iHt = \u2212t [\u03a91 X1 + g (XX + Y Y )] .\n\n(14)\n\nWe first establish a useful group-theoretical result about the exponentials of (14). We consider a\nsubalgebra of su(4), A0 = span{X1 , XX, Y Y, ZY }, whose generators obey the commutation relations\nsummarized in the following table:\n\nA0 :\n\nX1\nX1\n0\nXX\n0\nYY\nZY\nZY \u2212Y Y\n\nXX Y Y\n0\n\u2212ZY\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nX1\n\nZY\nYY\n0\n\u2212X1\n0\n\n.\n\n(15)\n\nNotice that ZY generator had to be added to the set of generators in order to ensure closure under\ncommutation.\nThe generator XX is central in A0 . Its span is a one-dimensional abelian ideal I \u2282 A0 , which makes\nA0 into a non-semisimple Lie algebra. This algebra is a direct sum of two subspaces, A0 = I \u2295 A1 ,\nwith A1 = span{X1 , Y Y, ZY } isomorphic to su(2).\nExponentiation of A0 results in a four-dimensional subgroup G0 = exp A0 \u2282 SU (4) whose every\nelement W can be written as a product\n2 Y Y \u2212b ZY\nW = e\u2212c1 XX |e\u2212a X1 \u2212c{z\n}.\n\n(16)\n\nan element of exp A1\n\nBecause A1 has its own Cartan decomposition (e.g., A1 = span{X1 } \u2295 span{Y Y, ZY } with Cartan\nsubalgebra AC = span{Y Y }), application of the Cartan decomposition theorem to the group G1 =\nexp A1 gives\nW = e\u2212c1 XX e\u2212\u03b1 X1 e\u2212c2 Y Y e\u2212\u03b2 X1 .\n(17)\nNow, because e\u2212iHt = e\u2212t[\u03a91 X1 +g(XX+Y Y )] is itself an element of G0 = exp A0 , it can also be\nwritten as such product\ne\u2212t[\u03a91 X1 +g(XX+Y Y )] = e\u2212\u03b1 X1 e\u2212c1 XX\u2212c2 Y Y e\u2212\u03b2 X1 ,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere the commutativity of X1 and XX has been used to rearrange the factors on the right.\nThus given any gate (t, \u03a91 , g) generated by H in (14), with coupling g fixed by architecture, there\nalways exists a set of four numbers (\u03b1, c1 , c2 , \u03b2) which represent that gate exactly. This is essentially\nthe same good old Cartan decomposition theorem (6) for SU (4), restricted to a physically relevant\nsubgroup G0 associated with experimentally available Hamiltonian (14).\nBy fixing \u03a91 and evolving the system freely under the action of its Hamiltonian, we generate a flow\nalong a straight line in su(4) which has its image in both, the Weyl chamber and the group SU (4).\nThe converse is unfortunately not necessarily true: for a given gate (\u03b1, c1 , c2 , \u03b2) it is not always\npossible to find (t, \u03a91 ) generating that gate. This is because of noncommutativity between X1 and\nYY.\n\n5\n\n\fEven though there is no guarantee that H would be able to reach every (c1 , c2 , 0) equivalence class\nin a single application, it is interesting to find out what actually can be reached. In particular, we\nwant to know if [CNOT] is reachable.\nIt is obvious that if \u03a91 = 0, then any local class with c1 = c2 and c3 = 0 can be directly reached.\nWhat if \u03a91 6= 0?\nWe will be interested in purely geodesic solutions to (18). Thus, setting \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 0 and directly\nexponentiating in (18) we get the matrix equation\n\uf8ee\n\nwhere\n\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\ncos b1 \u2212 cos a\n0\nicd sin a\ni(sin b1 \u2212 d sin a)\n0\ncos b2 \u2212 cos a\ni(sin b2 + d sin a)\nicd sin a\nicd sin a\ni(sin b2 + d sin a)\ncos b2 \u2212 cos a\n0\ni(sin b1 \u2212 d sin a)\nicd sin a\n0\ncos b1 \u2212 cos a\ntg\na=\n2\n\ns\n\n1+\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03a91\ng\n\n\u00132\n\n,\n\n1\nb1,2 = (tg \u2212 c1 \u00b1 c2 ),\n2\n\nc=\n\n\u03a91\n,\ng\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa = 0,\n\uf8fb\n\n1\nd= r\n\u0010 \u00112 .\n1 + \u03a9g1\n\n(19)\n\n(20)\n\nIf \u03a91 6= 0, then sin a = 0, leading to cos a = \u00b11 and cos b1 = cos b2 = \u00b11, sin b1,2 = 0. This is only\npossible if b1 = b2 + 2\u03c0m, or\nc2 = 2\u03c0m, m = 0, 1, 2, . . . .\n(21)\nThe minimal time solution is therefore\ntmin =\n\u03a91\ng\n\n=\n\nc1\n,\ng\ns\u0012\n\n4\u03c0n\nc1\n\n\u00132\n\n\u2212 1,\n\nn = 1, 2, 3, . . . .\n\n(22)\n\nThus, by following H along its geodesic for a time tmin we can (exactly) reach any equivalence class\nlocated on the XX axis of the Weyl chamber. It is clear that the coupling constant g plays the role\nof the scaling factor between the coordinate c1 of the point on this axis and the actual, physical time\nrequired to reach that point.\nWe want to emphasize that the corresponding trajectory in the Weyl chamber is not a straight\nline from O to [CNOT], even though is is a straight line in the full Lie algebra su(4). This is because\nwith \u03a91 now being fixed by (22), it is not true that e\u2212t[\u03a91 X1 +g(XX+Y Y )] \u223c e\u2212c1 (t) XX is satisfied for\nall intermediate times 0 < t < tmin . In general for such times, c2 (t) 6= 0 in (18).\nOne important local class belonging to the XX axis is [CNOT], which can be made by exponentiating the Hamiltonian \u2212iH[CNOT] t = \u2212tXX with t = \u03c0/2. The corresponding matrix in the\ncomputational basis is\n\u0012\n\n\u03c0\n[CNOT] = exp \u2212 XX\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n\uf8ee\n\n1 \uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n=\u221a \uf8ef\n2\uf8f0\n\n\uf8f9\n\n1\n0\n0 \u2212i\n0\n1 \u2212i 0 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa \u2208 SU (4).\n0 \u2212i 1\n0 \uf8fb\n\u2212i 0\n0\n1\n\n(23)\n\nThe Makhlin invariants [12] of this [CNOT] are G1 = 0 and G2 = 1, as required, so this is a perfectly\nacceptable [CNOT] out of which the canonical CNOT with matrix\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\nCNOT = \uf8ef\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n6\n\n0\n0\n0\n1\n\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa \u2208 U (4)\n\uf8fb\n\n(24)\n\n\fcan be produced by local manipulation of individual qubits. We will give some examples of the needed\nfor this local rf-pulses in Section 5.\nThus, setting c1 = \u03c0/2 in (22), we get\ntmin = \u03c0/(2g),\n\u03a91 /g =\nThe simplest exact [CNOT] is then\n\np\n\n64n2 \u2212 1,\n\n\u03c0\n\n[CNOT] = e\u2212 2g [\n\nn = 1, 2, 3, . . . .\n\n\u221a\n63gX1 +g(XX+Y Y )]\n\n(25)\n\n.\n\n(26)\n\nn = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,\n\n(27)\n\nFor completeness we mention another [CNOT] solution to (18),\n\u03a91 /g =\nwhich is up-to-phase geodesic,\n\np\n\n16n2 \u2212 1,\n\n\u03c0\n[\u03a91 X1 +g(XX+Y Y )]\n\u2212 2g\n\n[CNOT] = e2\u03c0 X1 e\n\n4.2\n\n.\n\n(28)\n\nThe XX + Y Y + kZZ case\n\nWe are now going to show that a single application of the Hamiltonian given in (13) generates the\nexact [CNOT], provided both Rabi terms are kept.\nDerivation parallels the previous case.

This\nmakes A0 into a non-semisimple Lie algebra which is a direct sum of two subspaces, A0 = I \u2295 A1 ,\nwhere A1 = span{X1 , X2 , Y Y, ZZ, Y Z, ZY }.\nExponentiation of A0 results in a seven-dimensional subgroup G0 = exp A0 \u2282 SU (4) whose every\nelement W can be written as a product\nW = e\u2212c1 XX e| \u2212a X1 \u2212b X2 \u2212c2 Y Y{z\u2212c3 ZZ\u2212d Y Z\u2212f ZY} .\n\n(30)\n\nW = e\u2212c1 XX e\u2212\u03b1 X1 \u2212\u03b2 X2 e\u2212c2 Y Y \u2212c3 ZZ e\u2212\u03b7 X1 \u2212\u03be X2 .\n\n(31)\n\nan element of exp A1\n\nBecause A1 has its own Cartan decomposition (e.g., A1 = span{X1 , X2 } \u2295 span{Y Y, ZZ, Y Z, ZY }\nwith a Cartan subalgebra AC = span{Y Y, ZZ}), application of the Cartan decomposition theorem to\nthe group G1 = exp A1 gives\n\n7\n\n\fSince e\u2212iHt = e\u2212t[\u03a91 X1 +\u03a92 X2 \u2212g(XX+Y Y +kZZ)] is itself an element of G0 = exp A0 , it can also be\nwritten as such product\ne\u2212t[\u03a91 X1 +\u03a92 X2 +g(XX+Y Y +kZZ)] = e\u2212\u03b1 X1 \u2212\u03b2 X2 e\u2212c1 XX\u2212c2 Y Y \u2212c3 ZZ e\u2212\u03b7 X1 \u2212\u03be X2 .\n\n(32)\n\nThus, given any gate (t, \u03a91 , \u03a92 , g, k) generated by H in (13), with couplings g and k fixed by\narchitecture, there always exists a set of seven numbers (\u03b1, \u03b2, c1 , c2 , c3 , \u03b7, \u03be) which represent that\ngate exactly.
