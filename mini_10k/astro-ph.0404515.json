This is not surprising. In our matter dominated universe any\nantimatter source of that magnitude certainly is extraordinary and deserves close attention. What is surprising is why this has not happened earlier, because the 511 keV\nphoton emission from the galactic bulge was first detected more than 30 years ago[1].\nMaybe the explanation is given by the Andre Gide's aphorism: \"Everything has been\nsaid before, but since nobody listens we have to keep going back and beginning all\nover again.\"\nThe INTEGRAL-SPI measured flux [2] confirms earlier findings and equals\nflux \u2248 10\u22123 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 .\n\n(1)\n\nBesides, these new measurements provide crucial information on the geometry of the\nsource and firmly establish that the bulk of annihilation takes place in the Galactic\nbulge at the distance of about 8 kpc [3]. The flux suggests a positron annihilation\nrate of\nR \u2248 1.3 \u00d7 1043 s\u22121 ,\n\n(2)\n\nif it is assumed that the annihilation proceeds via positronium and the positronium\nfraction is 0.93, as implied by observations [3].\nThe origin of the positrons is unclear. Certainly a conventional explanation might\nbe possible, and several have been proposed (see e.g.[4]). More exotic mechanisms are\nalso possible, including the recent suggestion of decays or annihilations of hypothetical\ndark matter particles in the MeV mass range[5, 6]. In this note, we would like to point\nout that a natural mechanism for positron production occurs in the mirror matter\nmodel and that this mechanism can help supernovas to explode and also explain\ngamma ray bursts.\nRecall, mirror matter is predicted to exist if nature exhibits an exact unbroken\nmirror (exact parity) symmetry[7]. The general idea, as well as some details, have\nbeen reviewed many times (see e.g. Ref.[8]). But since, perhaps, only a small part\nof the astroparticle physics community listens, we will go back and repeat the main\npoints again.\nFrom modern perspectives, symmetry principles play a crucial role in the Grand\nDesign of the Universe, space-time and gauge symmetries being the most important\nplayers. The proper Lorentz group is isomorphic to the SL(2, C) group and this\nenables one to define notions of left and right chirality at the fundamental level of\nspinor fields. One can expect that the gauge symmetry group G (where G = SU(3) \u2297\nSU(2) \u2297 U(1) is the simplest case) treats the left and right chiral fields on an equal\nfooting. Surprisingly this is not the case: weak interactions are left-handed and no\nright-handed neutrinos have been observed. Perhaps the best explanation of this\npuzzle is given by the anthropic principle.\nOne needs neutrinos and weak interactions to ensure our existence, because they\nplay an important role in the Sun's energetics. But neutrinos cannot be too massive\notherwise they will overclose the Universe [9] and make the existence of intelligent\n1\n\n\fobservers impossible. In fact this cosmological bound implies [10] m\u03bd \u2264 40 eV.\nIn the presence of right-handed neutrinos nothing will prevent neutrinos to acquire\nDirac masses of the order of the accompanying lepton masses. Therefore the Designer\nof our universe is bound to violate parity invariance in order for the universe to be\nhospitable to observers2 .\nIn spite of the apparent parity non-invariance of the ordinary particles, the universe\ncould still be left-right symmetric if CP were an exact symmetry[11]. But this option\nis not allowed too, because in the CP-symmetric universe there will be no baryonic\nasymmetry and hence no observers [12] (it is also ruled out by experiments on kaons\nand B-mesons!).\nHowever, there is a subtle way out. It is possible to build a left-right symmetric\nuniverse by doubling the gauge symmetry so that the full gauge group becomes G\u2297G.\nThen for each type of ordinary particle (electron, quark, photon etc) there is a mirror\npartner (mirror electron, mirror quark, mirror photon etc), of the same mass. The\ntwo sets of particles form parallel sectors each with gauge symmetry G \u2013 except that\nwhere the ordinary particles have left-handed (V-A) weak interactions, the mirror particles have right-handed (V+A) weak interactions. The unbroken mirror symmetry\nmaps ordinary particles into mirror particles and includes space inversion (the explicit\ntransformation is given in Ref.[7]). Exact unbroken time reversal symmetry also exists in this model [7]. Therefore the full Poincar\u00e9 group, including improper Lorentz\ntransformations, becomes an exact symmetry group of nature. This is certainly appealing esthetically. However, an even more subtle point is the realization that this\nrestoration of left-right symmetry might be necessary for anthropic reasons, just like\nthe previous two steps (P and CP violations). Justification comes from considering\npossible interactions between two parallel sectors as we will now explain.\nOrdinary and mirror particles should interact with each other by gravity. Some\nother interactions are also allowed3 and for our goals the most important one is the\npossible photon-mirror photon kinetic mixing interaction:\nP\n\n\u01eb\n\u2032\nL = F \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd\n,\n2\n\n(3)\n\n\u2032\nwhere F \u03bc\u03bd (F\u03bc\u03bd\n) is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism (mirror electromagnetism). Photon-mirror photon mixing causes mirror charged particles to couple to\nordinary photons with a small effective electric charge, \u01ebe[7, 14, 15].\nMirror matter is necessarily dark and stable and is an impressive dark matter\ncandidate which has been extensively studied in recent years[16]. Hard experimental\nevidence for mirror matter-type dark matter comes from the impressive DAMA/NaI\nexperiment[17]. It turns out that this experiment is consistent with halo dark matter\n2\nOne consequence of this is that the right-handed neutrinos can be gauge singlets which means\nthat they are able to gain a large Majorana mass, leading to small effective \u03bdL masses (see-saw\nmechanism).\n3\nGiven the constraints of gauge invariance, renomalizability and mirror symmetry it turns out[7]\nthat the only allowed non-gravitational interactions connecting the ordinary particles with the mirror\nparticles are via photon-mirror photon kinetic mixing and via a Higgs-mirror Higgs quartic coupling,\nL = \u03bb\u03c6\u2020 \u03c6\u03c6\u2032\u2020 \u03c6\u2032 . If neutrinos have mass, then ordinary - mirror neutrino oscillations may also occur\n[13].\n\n2\n\n\fconsisting of mirror particles interacting with ordinary particles via the photon-mirror\nphoton kinetic mixing interaction, Eq.(3)[18]. A fit to the DAMA annual modulation\nsignal suggests[18]\n\u01eb \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u22129\n\n(4)\n\nImportantly, the mirror matter explanation of the DAMA signal is not in conflict with\nany other experiment[18, 19].\nWe now consider the effect of photon-mirror photon kinetic mixing, Eq.(3), in the\ncore of an ordinary type II supernova (the more interesting case of a mirror supernova will be considered in a moment). The main production process for minicharged\nparticles in the core of a mirror supernova is the plasmon decay process (see e.g. [20]\nfor a review). The energy loss rate for production of minicharged particles has been\ncalculated in Ref.[20]:\n!\n\n8\u03b6(3) 2 2 2 \u03c0 2 T 2\nT 3 Q1\nQp =\n\u01eb \u03b1 \u03bce +\n9\u03c0 3\n3\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Q1 is a factor of order unity. Qp exceeds the energy loss rate due to neutrino\n>\nemission for |\u01eb| \u223c 10\u22129 [20]. This of course assumes that the minicharged particles\nfreely stream out of the core. This will not be the case for e\u2032\u00b1 , \u03b3 \u2032 (we denote mirror\nparticles with a prime) because they will be trapped by their own mirror electromagnetic interactions. So for \u01eb \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u22129 , we expect e\u2032\u00b1 , \u03b3 \u2032 to roughly thermalize with\nthe ordinary particles in the core of the supernova. This means that the energy loss\nrate due to emission of e\u2032\u00b1 , \u03b3 \u2032 need not be much greater than that due to neutrino\nemission (however it should be comparable). Of course, direct detection of e\u2032\u00b1 , \u03b3 \u2032 from\na supernova seems to be difficult if not impossible for ordinary matter observers.\nLet us stress that \u01eb \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u22129 , implied by the DAMA annual modulation signal\n[18], is just in the interesting range where the effects of the photon-mirror photon kinetic mixing becomes important for supernova energetics and dynamics. For \u01eb of that\nmagnitude the supernova energy loss through mirror channels becomes comparable\nto that due to neutrino emission. This raises an interesting question.\nIt is believed that neutrinos drive the evolution of the collapsing supernova core\nbecause they dominate the event energetically. Supernova explosions of massive stars\nare explained by convectivelly supported neutrino-heating mechanism [21]. But recent\nrefined simulations showed [22] that there is insufficient neutrino energy transfer behind the stalled supernova shock to produce the explosion. This suggests some missing\nphysics. In light of what was said above, we suggest that this missing physics is provided by the photon-mirror photon kinetic mixing: The e\u2032\u00b1 , \u03b3 \u2032 produced in the core\nwill interact and heat the matter behind the shock (adding to the effect of neutrinoheating) which might help produce the explosion. Let us see if this is reasonable. The\ncross section for MeV \u03b3 \u2032 (and large angle e\u2032\u00b1 ) scattering with ordinary electrons and\npositrons (i.e. \u03b3 \u2032 + e\u00b1 \u2192 \u03b3 + e\u00b1 and e\u2032\u00b1 + e\u00b1 \u2192 e\u2032\u00b1 + e\u00b1 ) is of order\n2\n\n\u03c3\u223c\u01eb\n\n\u03c0r02\n\n\u223c 10\n\n\u221241\n\n\u0012\n\n\u01eb\n5 \u00d7 10\u22129\n\n3\n\n\u00132\n\ncm2\n\n(6)\n\n\fwhere r0 = \u03b1/me is the classical radius of the electron. Remarkably this is roughly\nthe same size as the neutrino nucleon cross section,\n\u03c3(\u03bd\u0304e p \u2192 ne+ ) =\n\n4G2F E\u03bd2\n\u03c0\n\n\u2248 10\u221241\n\n\u0012\n\nE\u03bd\n10 MeV\n\n\u00132\n\ncm2\n\n(7)\n\nwhere E\u03bd is the energy of the neutrino. Importantly, the energy dependence is different: compared with neutrino interactions, the mirror particle interactions with\nordinary matter are larger at lower energies[23]. Evidently the heating effect of the\nmirror particle interactions on the ordinary matter just behind the shock is expected\nto be comparable to \u2013 or may even exceed \u2013 the neutrino effect. This seems to be\nrather nice for supernova explosions!\nIt appears, therefore, that the anthropic argument outlined above becomes beautifully complete. One needs supernovas to explode to make heavy elements which are\ncrucial for our existence. But in a universe without mirror particles supernovas do not\nexplode, therefore such universe is devoid of observers. The Designer has to restore\nthe left-right symmetry by introducing mirror particles and arrange the photon-mirror\nphoton kinetic mixing of the right magnitude to ensure the appearance of intelligent\nobservers.\nIn the case of a mirror type II supernova, things are no less interesting. In this case,\nthe core of the mirror supernova would be a source of ordinary electrons, positrons and\ngamma rays \u2013 making such an event easily detectable for ordinary matter observers.\nDuring a mirror supernova explosion an enormous energy will be deposited in a short\ntime and a small volume in mildly relativistic e+ e\u2212 \u03b3 plasma. The resulting fireball\nwill lead to a gamma ray burst (GRB) [24] provided that the number of ordinary\nbaryons in the mirror supernova is sufficiently low. In fact the gamma ray burst\nhas roughly the right characteristics (energy release, time scale, and potentially small\nbaryon load) to be identified with the observed gamma ray bursts as pointed out by\nBlinnikov[25]4 . In this case one might expect that the distribution of GRBs should\nbe correlated with the distribution of dark matter which is not excluded [27].\nFor the purposes of this paper we will simply define fe+ , fe\u2212 , f\u03b3 as the fraction\nof the total energy of the collapsing mirror star released as e+ , e\u2212 , \u03b3 respectively (of\ntypical energy of order 10 MeV). We will not attempt to precisely calculate fi , since\nthe details are quite complicated with many sources of uncertainty. Crudely speaking,\nfi would be expected to be of order 0.1.\nThe total energy released in mirror supernova should be similar to ordinary supernova which is of order\nESN \u223c 1053\u221254 ergs.\n4\n\n(8)\n\nBlinnikov considered neutrino-mirror neutrino oscillations (rather than the photon-mirror photon\nkinetic mixing interaction) as the mechanism to convert mirror particles into ordinary particles in\nthe core of a mirror supernova. However, Volkas and Wong[26] showed that that mechanism was not\nviable due to matter effects which suppress neutrino-mirror neutrino oscillations.\n\n4\n\n\fThis means that the number of e\u00b1 , \u03b3 produced in a mirror type II supernova should\nbe roughly:\nNe+ \u2243 Ne\u2212 \u223c N\u03b3 =\n\nfi ESN\nhEi i\n\n\u223c 10\n\n57\n\nfi\n0.1\n\n!\n\n(9)\n\nwhere i labels e+ , e\u2212 , \u03b3 and we have used hEi i \u223c 10 MeV.\nThe positrons (and electrons) will be confined by the magnetic field of the galaxy\nand eventually thermalize and annihilate (with stopping distance of order 1025 cm[5]\n>\nand time scale \u223c 108 years) producing two 511 keV gamma rays. Thus, the 511 keV\ngamma ray production rate is\ndN\u03b3\n\u223c\ndt\n\n!\n\nfe+\n1057 RSN\n0.1\n\n(10)\n\nwhere RSN is the rate of mirror supernova explosions with sufficiently small ordinary\nbaryon load in the galactic bulge. Equating this rate to the measured rate, Eq.(2),\ngives a rate of roughly,\nRSN \u223c 10\u22122 per million years\n\n(11)\n\nOf course this is only an order of magnitude estimate with many sources of uncertainty. For example, it may turn out that a significant fraction of positrons annihilate\nbefore becoming non-relativisitic, which would mean that RSN would be somewhat\nlarger than our estimate above. Anyway, according to the estimate in Ref.[5], the\npositrons should be confined (by the magnetic field) to a region of order a parsec from\ntheir production point. Thus, we would not expect a uniform positron emission from\nthe bulge, but rather a finite set of sources, each in the vicinity of a mirror type II\nsupernova. This is one way, in principle, to distinguish this explanation from explanations involving exotic MeV particle decays or annihilations[5, 6]. The observations\nare consistent with a uniform distribution but future observations may reveal some\nsubstructure.\nInterestingly, the rate, RSN , inferred above is also roughly consistent with the\nobserved rate of gamma ray bursts: a mirror supernova rate of 10\u22122 per million years\nin our galaxy, would suggest a rate of about 102 per year per 10 billion galaxies (of\norder the number of galaxies in the observable universe). This is roughly the observed\nrate of gamma ray bursts. Of course there is no reason for this rate to be exactly\nuniform \u2013 so this extrapolation cannot be rigorous.\nNote that RSN is much less than the rate of ordinary type II supernova explosions\nin our galaxy. This probably means that most mirror type II supernova do not lead to\ngamma ray bursts. This might occur if most mirror supernova have enough ordinary\nbaryons to absorb the energy of the expanding e\u00b1 , \u03b3 fireball. Even a relatively small\nproportion of ordinary baryons (\u223c 10\u22125 M\u2299 ) might be enough, since one must take\ninto account the effect of proton-mirror proton collisions which could rapidly cool\nthe protons, dumping energy into the collapsing mirror star and potentially also help\n5\n\n\fpower the explosion. In this way a small baryon load might act as a type of catalyst\nallowing energy from the relatistic e\u00b1 , \u03b3 fireball to be converted into heating the mirror\nbaryons. Very small baryon load (\u226a 10\u22125 M\u2299 ) is also problematic for observations.\nAssociated clean fireballs produce [28] intense, extremely short (subsecond) gammaray transients with very energetic (\u226b 10 MeV) gamma-rays. Such events are hard\nto detect because of dead time and sensitivity limitations of previous gamma-ray\ndetectors [28].\nFinally, note that idea that the 511 keV annihilation radiation might be connected\nwith gamma ray bursts is not new. In particular, Ref.[29] considered the possibility\nof a gamma ray burst occurring in the galactic center within the past 106 yr might\nexplain the 511 keV photon emission. Irrespective of the nature of the GRB central\nengine, copious pair production is expected during fireball bursting phase due to\n\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3 absorption between high energy photons with estimated number of produced\npairs \u223c 1054 E\u03b32 , where E\u03b3 is the GRB energy released in gamma-rays in 1052 ergs\nunits [30]. This estimation does not depend on any special model, but only assumes\nthat the observed intrinsic GRB spectrum can be extrapolated to very high energies\n[30]. Nevetheless it is close to our rough estimation Eq.(9). Even more important is\nthat the new born e\u00b1 pairs survive and do not annihilate with each other into \u03b3 rays\nagain because their annihilation time for typical GRB parameters is much longer than\nthe hydrodynamic time in the comoving frame [30].\nIn conclusion, we have shown that mirror matter provides a simple physical picture\nin which to explain three astroparticle puzzles: origin of positrons in the galactic\ncenter, the nature of the gamma-ray bursts central engine and the mechanism of\nsupernova explosions. This is of course, just a beginning \u2013 more detailed calculations\nwould be helpful, along with additional experiments to more precisely pin down the\nparameter, \u01eb, which couples the ordinary world to the mirror one. However, the fact\nthat the mirror particles are expected to be generated in a supernova core and their\ncross sections with ordinary matter turns out to be about the same as the neutrino\none (for energies relevant for supernovas) gives significant encouragement that we are\non the right track: if the cross section turned out to be much larger than the neutrino\none then the e\u00b1 , \u03b3 would never escape the mirror supernova which means that we\ncould not explain gamma ray bursts or galactic positrons, if the cross section turned\nout to be much smaller, it could not help supernovas to explode. Of course, we need\nsupernovas to explode, not just to agree with observations, but more importantly, to\ngenerate heavy elements. From this anthropic point of view, gamma-ray bursts and\ngalactic bulge positrons could be viewed as simply byproducts of our own existence!\n\nAcknowlegements\nThe authors would like to thank S.
