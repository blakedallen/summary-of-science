Our work is motivated by the analysis of the six-vertex\nmodel in statistical mechanics introduced in [24] and studied in many papers since then, see e.g.\n[3, 21, 20, 24, 28, 25, 38]. Colomo and Pronko [10, 11] studied the role of orthogonal polynomials\nin the six-vertex model, and in particular the Meixner-Pollaczek polynomials. An object of major\nphysical interest is the partition function of this model. A rather complete analysis of the large n\nasymptotics in the homogeneous case is based on the analysis of a Riemann-Hilbert problem for\northogonal polynomials [6, 7, 8, 9]. In the inhomogeneous case, the corresponding reasoning leads\nto questions of asymptotics of multiple orthogonal polynomials, as we will discuss in Section 2.4.\nHere we will focus on a particular regime of the six-vertex model, known as the \"free fermion\nline\". In the homogeneous case, this case is trivial, the partition function being identically 1.\nAlso in the inhomogeneous case, a closed expression for the partition function can be calculated\nexplicitly, so the present results do not give any new insights into the original model, but should\n\u2217 MSRI,\n\n17 Gauss Way, Berkeley, CA 94720-5070. email: mbender@msri.org\nof Mathematics, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200B, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.\nemail: {steven.delvaux, arno.kuijlaars}@wis.kuleuven.be.\nSteven Delvaux is a Postdoctoral Fellow of the Fund for Scientific Research - Flanders (Belgium).

This equilibrium problem is an important ingredient for the\nsteepest descent analysis of the Riemann-Hilbert problem for orthogonal polynomials, thereby\nallowing to obtain strong and uniform asymptotics of the polynomials, see e.g. [15, 16].\nFor the case of multiple orthogonal polynomials, however, no general result is known about\nthe existence of an equilibrium problem. The aim of this paper is to obtain such an equilibrium\nproblem for multiple Meixner-Pollaczek polynomials. The equilibrium problem will be posed in\nterms of a couple of measures (\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 ) and it involves both an external source acting on \u03bd1 and a\nconstraint acting on \u03bd2 . This structure is very similar to the equilibrium problem for the GUE\nwith external source model, [5].\nOur method for obtaining the equilibrium problem is similar to that applied to other systems\nof multiple orthogonal polynomials [18, 26], but a distinguishing feature is the characterization\nin terms of the eigenvalue distributions of block Toeplitz matrices, rather than usual (scalar)\nToeplitz matrices. We will provide some general results on this topic that are of independent\ninterest. Along the way we also obtain Rodrigues formulae and closed expressions for the recurrence coefficients for multiple Meixner-Pollaczek polynomials.\nInspired by the scalar case [15, 16], one might hope that the equilibrium problem presented\nin this paper can be used in the steepest descent analysis of the Riemann-Hilbert problem for\nmultiple Meixner-Pollaczek polynomials, thereby obtaining strong and uniform asymptotics for\nthese polynomials. This approach, although interesting, will not be carried out in this paper. We\nalso hope that our equilibrium problem might serve as an inspiration to obtain similar results\nfor the general inhomogeneous six-vertex model, not necessarily on the free fermion line, which\nin turn could serve as the first step in finding the large n asymptotic analysis for this model.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nStatement of results\nMultiple Meixner-Pollaczek polynomials\n\nLet w1 and w2 denote two distinct weight functions of Meixner-Pollaczek type; wj : R \u2192 R+\nwith\n1 2tj x\ne\n|\u0393 (\u03bb + ix)|2 , j = 1, 2,\n(2.1)\nwj (x) =\n2\u03c0\nwhere t1 , t2 \u2208 (\u2212\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2), t1 6= t2 and \u03bb > 0 are fixed parameters and \u0393 denotes Euler's gamma\nfunction [1]. Note that in (2.1) the gamma function is evaluated in a complex argument and that\n2\n\n|\u0393 (\u03bb + ix)| = \u0393 (\u03bb + ix) \u0393 (\u03bb \u2212 ix) ,\n\nfor any \u03bb, x \u2208 R.\n\n2\n\nFurthermore, for \u03bb fixed, |\u0393 (\u03bb + ix)| \u223c e\u2212\u03c0|x| as |x| \u2192 \u221e, so the restrictions on tj guarantee\nthat wj is exponentially decaying for x \u2192 \u00b1\u221e.\nLemma 2.1. (Existence, uniqueness, real and interlacing zeros) For any nonnegative integers k1\nand k2 , there is a unique monic polynomial Pk1 ,k2 of degree k = k1 +k2 satisfying the orthogonality\nconditions\nZ \u221e\nPk1 ,k2 (x)xm wj (x)dx = 0,\n\nfor m = 0, . . . , kj \u2212 1,\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n2\n\nj = 1, 2.\n\n\fThe zeros of these polynomials are real and interlacing, in the sense that each Pk1 ,k2 has\nk1 ,k2\nand\nk distinct real zeros x1k1 ,k2 < x2k1 ,k2 < * * * < xkk1 ,k2 such that xjk1 ,k2 < xjk1 \u22121,k2 < xj+1\nk1 ,k2\nwhenever 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k \u2212 1.\nxjk1 ,k2 < xkj 1 ,k2 \u22121 < xj+1\nLemma 2.1 will be proved in Section 3.1.\nIn analogy with the case of Meixner-Pollaczek orthogonal polynomials [23] we refer to the\nPk1 ,k2 as multiple Meixner-Pollaczek polynomials; see also [4, Sec. 4.3.3]. These polynomials are\nrelated to the six-vertex model; see Section 2.4. For information on other systems of multiple\northogonal polynomials in the literature, see e.g. [2, 34].\nIn this paper we will derive a Rodrigues type formula for the polynomials Pk1 ,k2 , enabling us\nto compute explicitly the following four term recurrence relations, to be proved in Section 3.\nTheorem 2.2. (Recurrence relations) Let t1 , t2 \u2208 (\u2212\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) with t1 6= t2 .

Fix t1 and t2 . For simplicity we choose a particular sequence of indices (k1 (k), k2 (k))\u221e\nk=1\nalong which we analyze the large k asymptotics of Pk1 (k),k2 (k) , and form the single sequence\n\u001a\nPk/2,k/2 (x)\nif k is even,\nQk (x) =\nP(k+1)/2,(k\u22121)/2 (x) if k is odd,\nof polynomials. We will show that the zero-distribution of the rescaled polynomials Qk (kx) has\na weak limit as k goes to infinity, and in order to study this we let n \u2208 N and introduce the\ndoubly indexed sequence of monic polynomials {Qk,n }k\u22650 defined by\nQk,n (x) =\n\n1\nQk (nx).\nnk\n\nFrom (2.2) and (2.3) we obtain an explicit recurrence relation for Qk,n ,\nxQk,n (x) = Qk+1,n (x) + ak,n Qk,n (x) + bk,n Qk\u22121,n (x) + ck,n Qk\u22122,n (x),\n\n3\n\n(2.4)\n\n\fwith initial conditions Q\u22123,n \u2261 Q\u22122,n \u2261 Q\u22121,n \u2261 0, where\n\uf8f1\n1 1 ,t2\n3k + 4\u03bb\nk\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nak,n = atk/2,k/2\n=\ntan t1 +\ntan t2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nn\n4n\n\u0012 4n\n\u0013\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nk(k + 2\u03bb \u2212 1)\n1\n1\n1 1 ,t2\n=\n+\nbk,n = 2 btk/2,k/2\nn\n8n2\ncos2 t1\ncos2 t2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n1 t1 ,t2\nk(k + 2\u03bb \u2212 1)(k + 2\u03bb \u2212 2) (tan t1 \u2212 tan t2 )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 ck,n =\n=\nc\nn3 k/2,k/2\n16n3\ncos2 t1\n\nfor k even and\n\uf8f1\n1 t2 ,t1\nk+1\n3k + 4\u03bb \u2212 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nak,n = a(k\u22121)/2,(k+1)/2\n=\ntan t1 +\ntan t2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nn\n4n\n4n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nk + 2\u03bb \u2212 1 k + 1\nk\u22121\n1 t2 ,t1\n+\nbk,n = 2 b(k\u22121)/2,(k+1)/2 =\nn\n8n2\ncos2 t1\ncos2 t2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n1\n(k\n\u2212\n1)(k\n+\n2\u03bb\n\u2212\n1)(k\n+\n2\u03bb \u2212 2) (tan t2 \u2212 tan t1 )\n\uf8f4\n2 ,t1\n\uf8f3 ck,n =\n=\nct(k\u22121)/2,(k+1)/2\n3\n3\nn\n16n\ncos2 t2\n\nfor k odd.\nUsing the recurrence relation\nthe eigenvalues of the 4-diagonal\n\uf8eb\na0,n\n\uf8ec b1,n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec c2,n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n0\n\n(2.5)\n\n(2.6)\n\n(2.4), standard considerations show that the zeros of Qn,n are\nmatrix\n\uf8f6\n1\n0\n\uf8f7\na1,n\n1\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n..\n\uf8f7\n.\nb2,n\na2,n\n.\n(2.7)\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n..\n..\n..\n\uf8f8\n.\n.\n.\n1\ncn\u22121,n bn\u22121,n an\u22121,n n\u00d7n\n\nSo the problem of the asymptotic zero-distribution of Qn,n reduces to finding the eigenvalue\nasymptotics of (2.7).

In other words, for large n, the matrix (2.7) has a locally block Toeplitz structure with\nsquare blocks of size r = 2. This allows its limiting eigenvalue distribution to be obtained from\na general machinery to which we turn now.\n\n2.2\n\nPolynomials generated by a general recurrence relation\n\nIn this subsection we will work in the following general setting. Let n be a fixed parameter\nand let (Qk,n (x))\u221e\nk=0 be a sequence of monic polynomials, where Qk,n has degree k and depends\nparametrically on n.

We also assume that the lower triangular part of Jn has a finite bandwidth, which is\nindependent of n.\nThe entries of Jn are assumed to have asymptotically periodic behavior with period r (r \u2265 1).\nMore precisely, suppose Jn is partitioned into blocks of size r \u00d7 r, with one superdiagonal and a\nfixed finite number \u03b2 of subdiagonal non-zero blocks,\n\uf8eb\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\u221e\n(k\u2212l)\nJn = Ak,n\n\nk,l=0\n\nwhere\n(\u22121)\n\nAk,n\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n\uf8ec ..\n\uf8ec\n= \uf8ec.\n\uf8ed0\n1\n\n0 ***\n..\n.\n0 ***\n0 ***\n\n(0)\n\nA0,n\n\n\uf8ec (1)\n\uf8ecA\n\uf8ec 1,n\n\uf8ec .\n\uf8ec ..\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec .\n\uf8ec .\n\uf8ec .\n=\uf8ec .\n\uf8ec .\n\uf8ec .\n\uf8ec (\u03b2)\n\uf8ecA\u03b2,n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ed\n..\n.\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n.. \uf8f7\n.\uf8f7\n,\n\uf8f7\n0\uf8f8\n0 r\u00d7r\n\n(\u22121)\n\nA0,n\n\n(0)\n\nA1,n\n..\n.\n..\n.\n..\n.\n\n0\n(\u22121)\n\nA1,n\n..\n.\n..\n.\n\n(\u03b2\u22121)\n\nA\u03b2,n\n\n(\u03b2)\n\nA\u03b2+1,n\n..\n.\n\nA\u03b2,n\n\nA\u03b2+1,n\n..\n.\n\n(0)\n\nAk,n\n\n(\u03b2\u22122)\n\n\uf8eb\n\u2217\n\uf8ec ..\n\uf8ec\n= \uf8ec.\n\uf8ed\u2217\n\u2217\n\n(\u03b2\u22121)\n\n\uf8f6\n***\n.. \uf8f7\n.\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n.. \uf8f7\n.\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n.. \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n. \uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n.. \uf8f7\n.\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n..\n.\n\n(2.11)\n\n.\n\n(2.12)\n\n1\n..\n\n\u2217 ***\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n,\n\uf8f7\n1\uf8f8\n\u2217 r\u00d7r\n\nwhere the \u2217's denote arbitrary constants.\n(j)\nWe will assume that the block entries Ak,n in (2.11) are slowly varying with n, in the sense\nthat the limits\n(j)\nlim Ak,n = A(j)\n(2.13)\ns\nrk/n\u2192s\n\nexist for any j = \u22121, 0, . . . , \u03b2 and s \u2265 0. Here the notation limrk/n\u2192s means that we let both\nk and n tend to infinity, in such a way that the ratio rk/n tends to a limit s \u2265 0. The relation\n(2.13) is on the level of r \u00d7 r matrices, with the limit taken entry-wise. If (2.13) holds then the\nmatrix in (2.11) is said to have locally block Toeplitz structure, in the spirit of [33].\n5\n\n\fFor fixed s, we collect the limiting matrices in (2.13) into the following matrix-valued Laurent\npolynomial As (z):\n(\u03b2) \u03b2\nAs (z) := As(\u22121) z \u22121 + A(0)\n(2.14)\ns + * * * + As z .\nWe will sometimes refer to As (z) as the symbol.

Note that fs depends on two complex variables\nz and x. By expanding the determinant (2.16) and using (2.15), we can write fs as a (scalar)\nLaurent polynomial in z:\nfs (z, x) = f\u22121,s (x)z \u22121 + f0,s (x) + * * * + fp,s (x)z p ,\n\n(2.17)\n\nwhere fj,s (x), j = \u22121, 0, . . . , p, are polynomials in x, with f\u22121,s (x) \u2261 (\u22121)r\u22121 . We define p in\n(2.17) as the largest positive integer for which fp,s 6\u2261 0.\nLet us solve (2.16) for z; this yields p + 1 roots\nzj = zj (x, s),\n\nj = 1, . . . , p + 1.\n\nWe assume that for each x \u2208 C these roots are ordered such that\n0 < |z1 (x, s)| \u2264 |z2 (x, s)| \u2264 * * * \u2264 |zp+1 (x, s)|.\n\n(2.18)\n\nIf x \u2208 C is such that two or more consecutive roots in (2.18) have the same absolute value, then\nwe arbitrarily label them so that (2.18) is satisfied.\nDefine the set\n\u03931 (s) = {x \u2208 C | |z1 (x, s)| = |z2 (x, s)|}.\n(2.19)\nIn the cases we are interested in, we will have that\n\u03931 (s) \u2282 R.\nSupposing this to hold, we define a measure \u03bcs1 on \u03931 (s) \u2282 R with density\n\u0012 \u2032\n\u0013\n\u2032\nz1+ (x, s) z1\u2212\n(x, s)\n1 1\ns\nd\u03bc1 (x) =\ndx.\n\u2212\nr 2\u03c0i z1+ (x, s) z1\u2212 (x, s)\n\n(2.20)\n\n(2.21)\n\nHere the prime denotes the derivative with respect to x, and z1\u00b1 (x, s) are the boundary values of\nz1 (x, s) obtained from the +-side (upper side) and \u2212-side (lower side) respectively of \u03931 (s) \u2282 R.\nThese boundary values exist for all but a finite number of points.\nAs discussed in [17], the measure \u03bcs1 can be interpreted as the weak limit as n \u2192 \u221e of the\nnormalized eigenvalue counting measures for the block Toeplitz matrices Tn (As ) associated to\nthe symbol (2.14).\n6\n\n\fLemma 2.3. With the above notation, we have\n\u0001\n(a) z1 (x, s) = x\u2212r + O x\u2212r\u22121 as x \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(b) \u03bcs1 in (2.21) is a Borel probability measure on \u03931 (s).\n\nProof. See [17].\nWith this notation in place, let us return to the sequence of polynomials (Qk,n )\u221e\nk=0 in (2.10).\nThis sequence is said to have real and interlacing zeros if each Qk,n has k distinct real zeros\nxk,n\n< xk,n\n< * * * < xk,n\nsuch that xk,n\n< xk\u22121,n\n< xk,n\n1\n2\nj\nj\nj+1 whenever 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k \u2212 1.\nk\nThe next result states that, under certain conditions, the normalized zero-counting measures\nof the polynomials Qn,n have a (weak) limit for n \u2192 \u221e, which is precisely the average of the\nmeasures (2.21). Here the average is with respect to the parameter s.\nTheorem 2.4. (Limiting zero distribution of Qn,n ) Let the sequence of polynomials (Qk,n )\u221e\nk=0\nbe such that (2.10)\u2013(2.13) hold. Assume that (Qk,n )\u221e\nk=0 has real and interlacing zeros for each\nn, as described above. Also assume that (2.20) holds for every s \u2265 0. Then as n \u2192 \u221e, the\nnormalized zero-counting measure \u03c1n of the polynomial Qn,n ,\nn\n\n\u03c1n :=\n\n1X\n\u03b4 n,n ,\nn j=1 xj\n\nwhere \u03b4z denotes the Dirac point mass at z, has the limit\nZ 1\n\u03bcs1 ds\nlim \u03c1n = \u03bd1 :=\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n(2.22)\n\n(2.23)\n\n0\n\nin the sense of weak convergence of measures, where \u03bcs1 is defined in (2.21).\nTheorem 2.4 will be proven in Section 4. This theorem generalizes a result for the scalar case\nr = 1 by Kuijlaars-Rom\u00e1n [26, Theorem 1.2]; see also [14, 27].\n\n2.3\n\nZeros of multiple Meixner-Pollaczek polynomials\n\nWe apply Theorem 2.4 to the polynomials Qk,n in Section 2.1. In what follows, we will assume\nthe condition of symmetric weights,\nt := t1 = \u2212t2 ;\nfor this case we can characterize the limiting zero distribution in terms of a constrained vector equilibrium problem, Theorem 2.6, which is the main result of the paper. The symmetry\ncondition in Proposition 2.5 is needed to prove that \u03931 (s) \u2282 R; in the general case this may fail.\nThe recurrence coefficients in (2.8) and (2.9) then become\n\uf8f1\na = \u2212\u00e3s = (tan t)s/2,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 s\n(2.24)\nbs =\nb\u0303s = (1 + tan2 t)s2 /4,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n2\n3\ncs = \u2212c\u0303s = tan t(1 + tan t)s /8 = as bs .\nWe partition the matrix Jn from (2.7) into blocks as in (2.11) with r = 2 and \u03b2 = 1.

(Limiting zero distribution) Suppose t1 = \u2212t2 = t \u2208 (0, \u03c0/2). As n \u2192 \u221e,\nthe normalized zero-counting measure \u03c1n of the multiple Meixner-Pollaczek polynomial Qn,n in\nR1\nSection 2.1, see (2.22), converges weakly to the average \u03bd1 = 0 \u03bcs1 ds of the measures \u03bcs1 in\n(2.21).\nProof. This is a consequence of Theorem 2.4. The assumptions in the latter theorem are indeed\nsatisfied: the interlacing condition follows from Lemma 2.1, and the fact that \u03931 (s) \u2282 R follows\nfrom Proposition 5.1.\nIn addition to the set \u03931 (s) in (2.19), we define\n\u03932 (s) = {x \u2208 C | |z2 (x, s)| = |z3 (x, s)|}.\n\n(2.27)\n\nWe will now characterize the limiting zero distribution \u03bd1 in terms of a vector equilibrium problem from logarithmic potential theory [30, 31]. Recall that for a pair of Borel measures (\u03bc, \u03bd)\nsupported in the complex plane, the mixed logarithmic energy of \u03bc and \u03bd is defined as [31]\nZZ\n1\nI(\u03bc, \u03bd) :=\nlog\nd\u03bc(x) d\u03bd(y).\n|x \u2212 y|\nTheorem 2.6.

A configuration of the six-vertex model is\nan assignment of an orientation to the edges of the lattice in such a way that each vertex is\nsurrounded by precisely two incoming and two outgoing edges. See Fig. 2 for a configuration\nwith N = 5. The name six-vertex model refers to the fact that the local behavior near each\nvertex is given by six possible edge configurations (see Fig. 3).\nWe consider the six-vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions (DWBC). This\nmeans that the edges at the top and bottom of the lattice must be directed outwards and those\nat the left and right of the lattice must be directed inwards.\n\n\u2732\n\u2732\n\u2732\n\u2732\n\u2732\n\n\u273b\nr \u2732\n\n\u273b\n\u273b\n\u273b\n\u273b\nr \u271b r \u271b r \u271b r \u271b x1\n\u2744\n\u273b\n\u273b\n\u273b\n\u273b\nr \u271b r \u2732 r \u2732 r \u271b r \u271b x2\n\u2744\n\u2744\n\u273b\n\u273b\n\u273b\nr \u2732 r \u271b r \u271b r \u2732 r \u271b x3\n\u2744\n\u2744\n\u2744\n\u273b\n\u273b\nr \u2732 r \u2732 r \u2732 r \u271b r \u271b x4\n\u2744\n\u2744\n\u2744\n\u2744\n\u273b\nr \u2732 r \u2732 r \u271b r \u271b r \u271b x5\n\u2744\n\u2744\n\u2744\n\u2744\n\u2744\ny1\ny2\ny3\ny4\ny5\n\nFigure 2: A configuration of the six-vertex model with DWBC for N = 5\n\n10\n\n\f\u2732\n\n\u2744\n\u271b r \u2732\n\n\u273b\nr \u271b\n\n\u2732\n\n\u273b\nr \u2732\n\n\u2744\n\u271b r \u271b\n\n\u273b\n\u271b r \u271b\n\n\u2732\n\n\u2744\nr\u2732\n\n\u2744\n\n\u273b\n\n\u273b\n\n\u2744\n\n\u273b\n\n\u2744\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFigure 3: Six types of vertices.\nTo each of the N rows of the lattice we associate a parameter xi \u2208 R and similarly to each\ncolumn a parameter yj \u2208 R, i, j = 1, . . . , N . We also fix a positive parameter \u03b3 and we assume\nthat |xi \u2212 yj | < \u03b3 for all i and j. We define the weight of the vertex in row i and column j\naccording to its type as sin(2\u03b3) (type 1 or 2), sin(\u03b3 \u2212 (xi \u2212 yj )) (type 3 or 4), or sin(\u03b3 + (xi \u2212 yj ))\n(type 5 or 6). Note that the weights are parameterized according to the so-called disordered\nphase convention.\nThe weight of a configuration is defined as the product of the weights of all the N \u00d7N vertices\nin the configuration. The partition function ZN = ZN (x1 , . . . , xN , y1 , . . . , yN , \u03b3) is defined as the\nsum of the weights of all the consistent configurations of the N \u00d7N six-vertex model with DWBC.\nAn explicit expression for the partition function in terms of an N \u00d7 N determinant was found\nby Izergin and Korepin [20, 21], see also [3, 25, 28].\nThe homogeneous case\nIn the case where xi \u2212 yj \u2261 t for all i, j = 1, . . . , N , for some fixed parameter t \u2208 (\u2212\u03b3, \u03b3), the\nIzergin-Korepin formula reduces to\n2\n\nZN = ZN (\u03b3, t) =\n\n[sin(\u03b3 + t) sin(\u03b3 \u2212 t)]N\ndet M,\n!2\nN\n\u22121\nY\nn!\n\n(2.34)\n\nn=0\n\nwhere the matrix M =\n\n(mi,j )N\ni,j=1\n\nhas entries\nZ \u221e\nmi,j =\nxi+j\u22122 etx w(x) dx\n\n(2.35)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwith\nw(x) =\n\nsinh( x2 (\u03c0 \u2212 2\u03b3))\n,\nsinh( x2 \u03c0)\n\n(2.36)\n\nsee e.g. [6, 21, 38]. The matrix M is then precisely the moment matrix corresponding to the\nweight function etx w(x) on the real line. Standard considerations (e.g. [32]) show that det M\ncan be expressed in terms of the monic orthogonal polynomials Pn (x) defined by\nPn (x) = xn + O(xn\u22121 )\nfor all n and\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nPn (x)xm etx w(x) dx = hn \u03b4m,n\n\n(2.37)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nfor all n, m with m \u2264 n.

Indeed,\nColomo and Pronko [10, 11] showed that the Continuous Hahn, Meixner-Pollaczek and continuous\nDual Hahn polynomials appear in this way. In more general cases, the expressions (2.34)\u2013(2.38)\nwere used to compute the asymptotics of the partition function ZN for large N in great detail\nby means of the Riemann-Hilbert method [6], see also [7, 8].\nThe inhomogeneous case\nThe situation in this paper corresponds to the case where\n\u001a\nt1 , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n 1 ,\nxi \u2212 yj \u2261\nt2 , n1 + 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n1 + n2 = N,\n\n(2.39)\n\nfor some t1 6= t2 and all j = 1, . . . , N . Following the reasoning in [21], see also the appendix in\n[12], one sees that the Izergin-Korepin formula reduces to\nZN =\n\n[sin(\u03b3 + t1 ) sin(\u03b3 \u2212 t1 )]n1 N [sin(\u03b3 + t2 ) sin(\u03b3 \u2212 t2 )]n2 N\ndet M\n! n \u22121 !

Thus M is a moment matrix with respect to the system of weight\nfunctions et1 x w(x) and et2 x w(x) on the real line.\nThe inhomogeneous model (2.40) was studied in [12, 13] in connection with the calculation of\nthe arctic curve. Leading order asymptotics of the partition function for the case n1 = 1 in (2.40)\nwas computed in [12] for the disordered regime, and in [13] for the anti-ferroelectric regime. The\nanalysis is valid in fact for any n1 as long as n1 = o(N ) as N \u2192 \u221e.\nIt turns out that det M can be expressed in terms of monic multiple orthogonal polynomials\nPk1 ,k2 (x) with respect to the system of weight functions et1 x w(x) and et2 x w(x). The polynomial\nPk1 ,k2 (x) is defined for any nonnegative integers k1 , k2 by\nPk1 ,k2 (x) = xk1 +k2 + O(xk1 +k2 \u22121 )\nand\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(j)\n\nPk1 ,k2 (x)xm etj x w(x) dx = hk1 ,k2 \u03b4m,kj ,\n\nm = 0, . . . , kj ,\n\nj = 1, 2.\n\n(2.42)\n\nWe now have the following generalization of the formula (2.38).\nProposition 2.8.

From the definition (2.41) it follows that\nN \u22121\n\nM = (hfi , gj i)i,j=0\nwhere we define the inner product\nhf, gi =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nf (x)g(x) dx\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nand where we use the functions\nfi (x) = xi et1 x w(x),\ni t2 x\n\nfn1 +i (x) = x e\n\ni = 0, . . . , n1 \u2212 1,\ni = 0, . . . , n2 \u2212 1,\n\nw(x),\n\nand\ngn (x) = xn ,\n\nn = 0, . . . , N \u2212 1.\n\nDefine functions \u03c6i (x) and \u03c8j (x), i, j = 0, . . . , N \u2212 1, by bi-orthogonalizing the functions fi (x)\nand gj (x) in the following way:\n\u03c6i (x) = fi (x) +\n\ni\u22121\nX\n\nck,i fk (x),\n\nj\u22121\nX\n\nbk,j gi (x),\n\nk=1\n\n\u03c8j (x) = gj (x) +\n\nk=1\n\nfor appropriate coefficients bk,j and ck,i , subject to the orthogonality relations\nh\u03c6i , \u03c8j i = hi \u03b4i,j .\n\n(2.44)\n(j(n))\n\nIt is not hard to see that we can identify \u03c8n (x) = Pk1 (n),k2 (n) (x) and hn = hk1 (n),k2 (n) .\nThen we have that\ndet M \u2261\n\n\u22121\n(hfi , gj i)N\ni,j=0\n\n=\n\n\u22121\n(h\u03c6i , \u03c8j i)N\ni,j=0\n\n=\n\nN\n\u22121\nY\n\nhn ,\n\nn=0\n\nwhere the last step follows in a trivial way from (2.44). In view of the identifications mentioned\nin the previous paragraph, we then obtain (2.43).\nIt is straightforward to generalize the above reasoning to the case of multiple values of the\ndifferences in (2.39). In general, one could even allow both xi and yj to take multiple values and\nthen one should deal with multiple orthogonal polynomials of mixed type. We leave the details\nto the interested reader.\n13\n\n\fThe free fermion line: Meixner-Pollaczek weights\nThe value \u03b3 = \u03c0/4 corresponds to the so-called free fermion line. As first observed in [11], in this\ncase the above weight functions are related to the Meixner-Pollaczek weight. Indeed, we then\nhave\nsinh( x\u03c0\n1\ntj x\n4 )\n.\n(2.45)\netj x w(x) = etj x\nx\u03c0 = e\nsinh( 2 )\n2 cosh( x\u03c0\n4 )\nWe may compare this with the classical Meixner-Pollaczek weight function [23],\n1 2tx\ne \u0393(x + ix)\u0393(\u03bb \u2212 ix).\n2\u03c0\n\n(2.46)\n\nBy invoking the identity\n\n\u03c0\n,\nsin(\u03c0z)\nwe see that (2.46) for \u03bb = 1/2 and t = 2tj reduces to\n\u0393(z)\u0393(1 \u2212 z) =\n\n1\n1 4tj x\ne\n\u0393(1/2 + ix)\u0393(1/2 \u2212 ix) = e4tj x\n.\n2\u03c0\n2 cosh(\u03c0x)\n\n(2.47)\n\nThus the weight functions (2.45) and (2.47) are the same up to a scaling of the variable x by a\nfactor 4.\nIt is an easy job to evaluate the Izergin-Korepin formula for the partition function explicitly\non the free fermion line, so our results will not lead to new insights in that perspective. They\nshould rather be considered as giving exact and asymptotic information on the multiple MeixnerPollaczek polynomials in its own right.\n\n2.5\n\nOutline of the paper\n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 3 we consider multiple Meixner-Pollaczek\npolynomials with respect to two general weights and prove Theorem 2.2. In Section 4 we establish\nTheorem 2.4 and Lemma 2.1, which together lead to Proposition 2.5. In Section 5 we prove\nTheorem 2.6 using the theory of eigenvalue asymptotics for banded block Toeplitz matrices.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nProofs of Lemma 2.1 and Theorem 2.2\nProof of Lemma 2.1\n\nIn this section we prove Lemma 2.1 on the fact that the multiple Meixner-Pollaczek polynomials\nPk1 ,k2 exist and are unique, and have real and interlacing zeros. It is well known that the\ncorresponding result about orthogonal polynomials with respect to one weight function holds;\nwe will rely on a generalization of this fact due to Kershaw, [22]. In our context it amounts to\nthe statement that a sufficient condition is that for any non-negative integer k = k1 + k2 and\nany polynomials A and B (not both identically zero) of degrees at most k1 and k2 \u2212 1 (or k1 \u2212 1\nand k2 ) respectively, the function f (x) = A(x)w1 (x) + B(x)w2 (x) has at most k zeros. Since\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1 2t2 x\n2\ne\n|\u0393 (\u03bb + ix)| A(x)e2(t1 \u2212t2 )x + B(x) ,\nA(x)w1 (x) + B(x)w2 (x) =\n2\u03c0\nthe conclusion will certainly follow if we can show that, for any real t, g(x) := A(x)e2tx + B(x)\nhas at most k zeros whenever A and B are polynomials such that deg A + deg B \u2264 k \u2212 1. (By\nconvention, the zero polynomial has degree \u22121.) This can easily be shown by induction, see e.g.\n[30, p. 138].\n\u0003\n\n14\n\n\f3.2\n\nSome generalities\n\nFor j = 1, 2, let wj be integrable real functions on the real line such that the measures wj (x)dx\nhave moments of all orders.

The sub-leading coefficient \u03b3k1 ,k2 of Pk1 ,k2 (x) is given by\n\u03b3k1 ,k2 = \u2212\n\n(2\u03bb + k \u2212 1)\n(k1 tan t1 + k2 tan t2 ).\n2\n\n(3.14)\n\nProof. Let k = k1 + k2 be fixed. The polynomial Pk1 +1,k2 \u2212 Pk1 ,k2 +1 is clearly of degree k and\nsatisfies kj orthogonality conditions with respect to wj , for j = 1, 2. It is thus a multiple of Pk1 ,k2 ,\nand reading off the leading coefficient gives Pk1 +1,k2 \u2212 Pk1 ,k2 +1 = (\u03b3k1 +1,k2 \u2212 \u03b3k1 ,k2 +1 )Pk1 ,k2 .\nMultiplying this relation by xk1 and integrating with respect to w1 gives the equation\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n0 \u2212 hk1 ,k2 +1 = (\u03b3k1 +1,k2 \u2212 \u03b3k1 ,k2 +1 )hk1 ,k2 ,\nwhich by Proposition 3.5 can be written\n\u03b3k1 +1,k2 \u2212 \u03b3k1 ,k2 +1 =\n\n(2\u03bb + k)\n(tan t2 \u2212 tan t1 ).\n2\n\n(3.15)\n\nIdentifying coefficients in the recurrence relation (3.4) for the ordinary monic orthogonal MeixnerPollaczek polynomials Pk1 ,0 with respect to w1 , gives \u03b3k1 +1,0 = \u03b3k1 ,0 + ak1 and so\n\u03b3k1 +1,0 = \u2212\n\nk1\nX\nj=0\n\naj = \u2212\n\n(k1 + 1)\n(2\u03bb + k1 ) tan t1 .\n2\n\nThen repeated application of (3.15) leads to the claim, for any k1 + k2 = k.\nFinally we are ready for the proof of Theorem 2.2.\n(j)\n\nProof of Theorem 2.2. With the explicit expressions for \u03b3k1 ,k2 and hk1 ,k2 given by Propositions\n3.5 and 3.6, this follows from the general recurrence relation (3.2).\n\n4\n\nProof of Theorem 2.4\n\nIn this section we will prove the general Theorem 2.4 on the asymptotic zero distribution of a\nsequence of polynomials Qk,n generated by a recurrence relation (2.10)\u2013(2.13). The main idea of\nthe proof follows the scalar case r = 1 by Kuijlaars-Rom\u00e1n [26, Theorem 1.2], see also [14, 27].\nBut we will need some nontrivial modifications due to the fact that r may be greater than 1.\nThe main tool in the proof is the following result on ratio asymptotics for the Qk,n , compare\nwith [26, Lemma 2.2].\n18\n\n\fLemma 4.1. (Ratio asymptotics) Under the assumptions of Theorem 2.4, we have that for each\ns > 0 there exists R > 0 so that all zeros of Qk,n belong to [\u2212R, R] whenever k \u2264 (s + 1)n.\nMoreover,\nQk,n (x)\n= z1 (x, s),\n(4.1)\nlim\nk/n\u2192s Qk+r,n (x)\nuniformly on compact subsets of C\\[\u2212R, R], where z1 (x, s) is the solution to the algebraic equation\n(2.16) with smallest modulus.\nProof. The claim about the boundedness of the zeros of Qk,n follows in a rather standard way\nfrom the assumptions, see e.g. [26, Proof of Lemma 2.2]. Now we turn to the claim (4.1). We\nconsider the family of functions\n\u001a\n\u001b\nQk,n (x)\nH=\n| k, n \u2208 N, k \u2264 (s + 1)n .\n(4.2)\nQk+1,n (x)\nFrom the assumption that the zeros of (Qk,n )k are real and interlacing, it follows that H is a\nnormal family (in the sense of Montel) on C\u0304 \\ [\u2212R, R], see e.g. [26, Proof of Lemma 2.2].\nUsing induction on l, we will show the following.\nClaim: For any m \u2208 {0, . . . , r \u2212 1} and for each l \u2265 1, the following holds. If (ki )i , (ni )i are\nsequences of non-negative integers with ki , ni \u2192 \u221e, rki /ni \u2192 s as i \u2192 \u221e, so that\nQrki +m,ni (x)\ni\u2192\u221e Qrki +m+r,ni (x)\n\nf (x) := lim\nexists for |x| > R, then\n\nf (x) = z1 (x, s)(1 + O(x\u2212l ))\n\nas x \u2192 \u221e.\n\nLet us prove this claim. We have z1 (x, s) = x\u2212r (1 + O(1/x)) as x \u2192 \u221e (Lemma 2.3(a)), and\nso it is clear that the claim holds for l = 1.\nNow assume that the claim holds for l \u2265 1. We will prove that it also holds for l + r. We\nwill prove this when m = 0; the proof for the other values of m can be given in a similar way.\nLetting (ki )i , (ni )i be as in the claim, our goal will be to prove that the function \u01eb(x) defined by\nQrki ,ni (x)\n= z1 (x, s)(1 + \u01eb(x))\u22121 ,\ni\u2192\u221e Qrki +r,ni (x)\nlim\n\n(4.3)\n\nsatisfies \u01eb(x) = O(x\u2212l\u2212r ) for x \u2192 \u221e.\nLet us prove this. Since rki /ni \u2192 s as i \u2192 \u221e, we may assume that\nrki \u2264 (s + 1)ni \u2212 (r \u2212 1)\nfor every i. For j = \u2212(r \u2212 1), . . . , r\u03b2, we then have that\nQrki \u2212j,ni\nQrki +1\u2212j,ni\nbelongs to the family H. Since H is a normal family, we may assume, by passing to a subsequence\nif necessary, that\nQrki \u2212j,ni (x)\nf (j) (x) = lim\ni\u2192\u221e Qrki +1\u2212j,ni (x)\n19\n\n\fexists for x \u2208 C\u0304 \\ [\u2212R, R] and j = \u2212(r \u2212 1), . . . , r\u03b2.\nTaking the ki th block row in (2.10) with n = ni and using (2.11), we obtain the matrix-vector\nrelation\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u0011 Qki \u2212\u03b2,ni (x)\n\u0010\n\uf8f7\n..\n(\u22121) \uf8ec\nxQki ,ni (x) = A(\u03b2)\n(4.4)\n* * * Aki ,ni \uf8ed\n\uf8f8,\n.\n| {z } | ki ,ni {z\n} Q\nr\u00d71\nki +1,ni (x)\nr\u00d7r(\u03b2+2)\n{z\n}\n|\nr(\u03b2+2)\u00d71\n\nwhere we denote with Qk,n (x) the r \u00d7 1 column vector\n\uf8eb\nQrk,n (x)\n\uf8ec\n..\nQk,n (x) := \uf8ed\n.\n\n\uf8f6\n\nQr(k+1)\u22121,n (x)\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8.\n\nDividing both sides of (4.4) by the scalar function Qrki ,ni (x), and taking the limit i \u2192 \u221e, we\nfind\n\uf8eb (\u03b2)\n\uf8f6\ne\n\u0010\n\u0011 Q (x)\n\uf8f7\n..\n(\u22121) \uf8ec\ne (0) (x) = A(\u03b2)\nxQ\n(4.5)\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8,\n* * * As\ns\n.\ne (\u22121) (x)\nQ\n\nwhere we used (2.13) and where we set\n\ne (j) (x) := lim Qki \u2212j,ni (x) ,\nQ\ni\u2192\u221e Qrki ,ni (x)\n\nj = \u22121, . . . , \u03b2,\n\n(4.6)\n\ne (j) (x), j =\nwhich exists entrywise due to our assumptions.

Each of the limits in (4.7) exists again entrywise due\nto our assumptions.

Suppose y \u2208 \u039321 (s) \u222a \u039322 (s). We can assume without loss of\ngenerality that y is not a branch point, since the number of branch points is finite and \u03931 (s) and\n\u03932 (s) in our case have no isolated points [17, 36]. Thus there exist distinct z1 , z2 \u2208 C such that\n|z1 | = |z2 | =: r and P (z1 , s) = y = P (z2 , s). By the factorization of P , we see that z 7\u2192 P (z, s)\nhas only negative real zeros and therefore the even function [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0] \u220b \u03b8 7\u2192 |P (rei\u03b8 , s)| is strictly\ndecreasing on (0, \u03c0), which implies in turn that z1 = z 2 . But\ny = P (z2 , s) = P (z 1 , s) = P (z1 , s) = y,\nso y is real, and hence \u039321 (s)\u222a \u039322 (s) \u2282 R. This argument also shows that \u039321 (s) \u2229 \u039322 (s) may\ncontain only branch points, since otherwise there would be three distinct values z1 , z2 , z3 with\nthe same modulus and y = P (z1 , s) = P (z2 , s) = P (z3 , s) which is clearly impossible.\nStudying the function R \u220b z 7\u2192 P (z, s) for fixed s > 0, we see that it has two local minima\nat the points\n!\nr\n9b2 + 1\n1\nz1 = 2 \u22121 +\ns\u22122 ,\nb\nb2 + 1\n22\n\n\fP (z, s)\n\ny1 (s)\n\u039321 (s)\n\nz2 (s)\nz0 (s)\n\nz1 (s)\n\nz\n\ny2 (s)\n\u039322 (s)\n\nFigure 4: Plot of P (z, s), z \u2208 R.\nand\n1\nz2 = \u2212 2\nb\nwith\n\n9b2 + 1\nb2 + 1\n\n!\n\ns\u22122 ,\n\n(5.3)\n\n2\n\n!\n\u221a\n27b4 + 18b2 \u2212 1 + b2 + 1(9b2 + 1)3/2\n= (c1 s)2 \u2265 0,\n32b2\n\n(5.4)\n\n2\n\n!\n\u221a\n27b4 + 18b2 \u2212 1 \u2212 b2 + 1(9b2 + 1)3/2\n= (ic2 s)2 \u2264 0,\n32b2\n\n(5.5)\n\ny1 (s) := P (z1 , s) = s\nand\ny2 (s) := P (z2 , s) = s\n\n1+\n\nr\n\nand that 0 is a local maximum attained at the point\nz0 (s) = \u2212\n\n4\ns\u22122\n1 + b2\n\n(see Fig. 4).\nSince\nP (z, s) = y\n\n(5.6)\n\nis a polynomial equation in z with real coefficients, it has two complex conjugate solutions if\ny \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, y2 (s)) \u222a (0, y1 (s)).

For the branch point y = y1 (s), we have that z1 (s) > 0\nis a double root to (5.6), and there is also a negative root z\u2212 (s) which is smaller than z2 (s) (see\nFig. 4).

By Proposition 5.1, the supports of the measures \u03bcs1 and \u03bcs2 are subsets of the real and\nimaginary lines respectively, which increase/decrease linearly in s. This means that we can\nintegrate the logarithmic potentials of \u03bcs1 and \u03bcs2 with respect to s and change the order of\nintegration to obtain\nZ 1 Z c1 s\nZ 1\ns\n1\nd\u03bcs1 (y)ds\nU \u03bc1 (x)ds =\nlog\n|y\n\u2212\nx|\n0\n0\n\u2212c1 s\nZ c1 Z |y|/c1\n1\nlog\n=\nds d\u03bcs1 (y) =: U \u03bd1 (x)\n|y \u2212 x|\n\u2212c1 0\nand similarly for \u03bd2 .

Inserting into\n(5.13) and (5.14) and putting l := 0 ls ds gives the stated inequalities.\nEquations (5.10) and (5.11) are the Euler-Lagrange variational conditions for the equilibrium\nproblem in Theorem 2.6. The external field V , density of the measure \u03bd1 and upper constraint\nmeasure \u03c3 can be calculated explicitly, and the following subsections are devoted to these computations.\n25\n\n\f5.3\n\nCalculation of V\n\nIn the calculations that follow we make use of the function\nQ(z) :=\n\n(4 + (1 + b2 )z)2 (4 + b2 z)\n,\n64z\n\n(5.16)\n\nwhich is such that\n\n1\nP (z/s2 ; s)\ns2\nfor every s > 0. So in particular Q(z) = P (z; 1). We also define\n\n(5.17)\n\nQ(z) =\n\nz\u0303j (x) := zj (x, 1),\n\nj = 1, 2, 3,\n\nand these are the solutions of Q(z) = x2 . Because of (5.17) we have\n1 \u0010x\u0011\nzj (x, s) = 2 z\u0303j\n,\ns > 0,\ns\ns\n\n(5.18)\n\nand it follows that\n\nz\u0303j\u2032 (x/s)\n1\n\u2202zj (x, s)\n=\n,\nzj (x, s)\n\u2202x\nsz\u0303j (x/s)\n\ns > 0,\n\nProposition 5.4. The external field V is given by\nZ\n1 \u221e\n|z2 (x, s)|\nds = (\u03c0 \u2212 2t)|x|,\nV (x) =\nlog\n2 0\n|z1 (x, s)|\n\nj = 1, 2, 3.\n\nx \u2208 R.\n\n(5.19)\n\n(5.20)\n\nProof. Because of symmetry, we may assume x > 0.\nIt follows from Proposition 5.1 that \u03931 (s) is increasing with s and x \u2208 \u03931 (s) if and only if\ns \u2265 x/c1 . Thus |z2 (x, s)| = |z1 (x, s)| for s \u2265 x/c1 , and the integral that defines V (x) can be\nrestricted to an integral over s \u2208 [0, x/c1 ]. Using (5.19) we obtain\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n\u2202z2 (x, s)\n\u2202z1 (x, s)\n1 x/c1\n1\ndV (x)\n1\nds\n=\n\u2212\ndx\n2 0\nz2 (x, s)\n\u2202x\nz1 (x, s)\n\u2202x\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\nz\u0303 \u2032 (x/s)\n1 x/c1 z\u03032\u2032 (x/s)\nds\n\u2212 1\n=\n2 0\nsz\u03032 (x/s) sz\u03031 (x/s)\n\u0013\nZ \u0012\n1 \u221e z\u03032\u2032 (u)\nz\u0303 \u2032 (u)\n=\ndu\n(5.21)\n\u2212 1\n2 c1\nuz\u03032 (u) uz\u03031 (u)\nwhere in the last step we made the change of variables u = x/s (recall that x > 0). Note that\n(5.21) does not depend on x. To evaluate (5.21) we note that both u 7\u2192 z\u03031 (u) and u 7\u2192 z\u03032 (u)\nare one-to-one for u \u2208 [c1 , \u221e) and they map the interval [c1 , \u221e) onto (0, z\u03031 (c1 )] and [z\u03032 (c1 ), \u221e),\nrespectively. We split the integral (5.21) into two integrals, and apply a change of variables z =\nz\u0303j (u) to each p\nof them. Then combining the two integrals again, and noting that z\u03031 (c1 ) = z\u03032 (c1 )\nand that u = Q(z) if z = z\u0303j (u) with j = 1, 2, we obtain\nZ\ndV (x)\n1 \u221e\ndz\np\n,\nx > 0.\n(5.22)\n=\ndx\n2 0 z Q(z)\nThe integral in (5.22) can be calculated explicitly, since\n!#\n\"\nd\n4\n4 + (b2 \u2212 1)z\n1\np\np\n=\n.\narctan\n=\u2212 p\ndz\n2 z(4 + b2 z)\n(4 + (1 + b2 )z) z(4 + b2 z)\n2z Q(z)\n26\n\n(5.23)\n\n\fTherefore\n4 + (b2 \u2212 1)z\ndV (x)\np\n= lim arctan\nz\u21920+\ndx\n2 z(4 + b2 z)\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\n\u03c0\nb \u22121\n.\n= \u2212 arctan\n2\n2b\n\n!\n\n\u2212 lim arctan\nz\u2192+\u221e\n\n4 + (b2 \u2212 1)z\np\n2 z(4 + b2 z)\n\n!\n\nUsing that b = tan t and applying trigonometric identities, we finally obtain\ndV\n= \u03c0 \u2212 2t.\ndx\n\n(5.24)\n\nNoting that V (0) = 0 since 0 \u2208 \u03931 (s) for every s > 0, we find the claimed expression for the\nexternal field by integrating (5.24) with respect to x.\nRemark 5.5. Note that the external field V has the form to be expected by analyzing directly\nthe asymptotics of the weight functions wi : For the rescaled polynomials Qk,n the orthogonality\nconditions read\nZ \u221e\nQk,n (x)xm wj (nx) dx = 0, m = 0, . . . , kj \u2212 1, j = 1, 2.\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThus we have new effective weights w\u0303j (x) = wj (nx). Using Stirling's formula,\n1 2tj nx\n2\ne\n|\u0393 (\u03bb + inx)|\n2\u03c0\n2\u03bb\u22121 2tj nx\u22122nx arg(\u03bb+inx)\n= e\u22122\u03bb |\u03bb + inx|\ne\n(1 + o(1))\n\nw\u0303j (x) =\n\n= en(2tj x\u2212\u03c0|x|)(1+o(1)).\n\nAsymptotically, the dominant weight determining the potential associated with the distribution\nof zeros, will be max{w\u03031 (x), w\u03032 (x)} = e\u2212n(\u03c0\u22122t)|x|(1+o(1)) , giving the external field V (x) =\n(\u03c0 \u2212 2t) |x|.\n\n5.4\n\nDensity of \u03bd1\n\nNext we turn to the density of \u03bd1 .\nProposition 5.6. The measure \u03bd1 is absolutely continuous with density given by (2.30)\u2013(2.32).\nProof.

Since x \u2208 (0, c1 ), we have that z\u03031+ (x) and z\u03031\u2212 (x)\nare each others complex conjugate, and it can be shown that Im z\u03031+ (x) < 0. The integral in\n(5.25) is from z\u03031+ (x) in the lower half plane topits complex conjugate in the upper half plane\nalong a path in C \\ (\u2212\u221e, 0]. The square root Q(z) is defined and analytic in C \\ (\u22124b\u22122 , 0]\nand it is positive for z real and positive.\nLet\n4 + (b2 \u2212 1)z\nw(x) = p\n,\nz = z\u03031\u2212 (x),\n0 < x < c1 .\n(5.26)\n2 z(4 + b2 z)\nThen by (5.23) and (5.25)\n\n\u0011\nd\u03bd1\n1 \u0010\narctan(w(x)) \u2212 arctan(w(x)) .\n(x) =\ndx\n2\u03c0i\n\nThe arctangent is understood here as an analytic function\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 \u2212 iw\ni\n,\nw \u2208 C \\ ((\u2212i\u221e, \u2212i) \u222a (i, i\u221e)).\narctan w = log\n2\n1 + iw\nThus\nd\u03bd1\n1\n(x) =\nlog\ndx\n4\u03c0i\n=\n\n1 \u2212 iw(x) 1 + iw(x)\n*\n1 + iw(x) 1 \u2212 iw(x)\n\n!\n\n1\n1 + iw(x)\nlog\n.\n2\u03c0\n1 \u2212 iw(x)\n\nUsing the defining relation Q(z\u03031\u2212 (x)) = x2 in (5.26) we can see that (5.26) is equal to (2.31)\u2013\n(2.32) and then (2.30) follows. Note also that Iw(x) < 0 since \u03bd1 has a positive density.\n\n5.5\n\nCalculation of upper constraint measure\n\nProposition 5.7. The upper constraint measure \u03c3 in (5.12) is a multiple of the Lebesgue measure\non the imaginary axis with density 2t/\u03c0.\nProof. Because of symmetry it is enough to consider the density on the positive imaginary axis.\nLet x \u2208 iR+ . Then\n\u0013\nZ |x|/c2 \u0012 \u2032\n\u2032\n(x, s)\nz2+ (x, s) z2\u2212\nd\u03c3\n1\nd\u03c3\nds\n(x) = i (x) =\n\u2212\n|dx|\ndx\n4\u03c0 0\nz2+ (x, s) z2\u2212 (x, s)\nand by a calculation as in the proof of Proposition 5.4 this is equal to\n\u0013\nZ i\u221e \u0012 \u2032\n\u2032\nz\u03032\u2212\n(u)\nz\u03032+ (u)\nd\u03c3\n1\ndu.\n(x) =\n\u2212\n|dx|\n4\u03c0 ic2\nuz\u03032+ (u) uz\u03032\u2212 (u)\nNow we are going to make the change of variables z = z\u03032\u00b1 (u). Since z2+ (i\u221e) = \u2212i\u221e,\nz2\u2212 (i\u221e) = +i\u221e, and z\u03032+ (ic2 ) = z\u03032\u2212 (ic2 ), we obtain\nZ +i\u221e\n1\nd\u03c3\ndz\n(x) = \u2212\n(5.27)\n|dx|\n4\u03c0 \u2212i\u221e z(Q(z))1/2\nwith integration along a contour from \u2212i\u221e to +i\u221e that intersects the real line in\n!\nr\n9b2 + 1\n1\n,\nz\u03032\u00b1 (ic2 ) = z2 (1) = \u2212 2 1 +\nb\nb2 + 1\n28\n\n\fsee (5.3) and Figure 4 for z2 (s). It is easy to check (and this can also be seen from Figure 4) that\n!\nr\n4\n1\n4\n9b2 + 1\n<\u2212 2\n.\n\u2212 2 <\u2212 2 1+\n2\nb\nb\nb +1\nb +1\nand so the contour intersects the real line in a point lying in between the simple root and the\ndouble root of Q(z). The branch of (Q(z))1/2 that is used in (5.27) is the one that is defined and\nanalytic in C \\ (\u2212\u221e, \u22124/b2] \u222a [0, \u221e) and that is in iR+ for z = z\u03032\u00b1 (ic2 ). Thus\n(Q(z))1/2 = \u2212i(4 + (1 + b2 )z)\n\n(4 + b2 z)1/2\n8(\u2212z)1/2\n\n(5.28)\n\nwith principal branches of the fractional powers.\nWe now deform the contour in (5.27) to the positive real axis. In doing so, we pick up a\nresidue contribution at z = \u2212 b24+1 , which is\n1\n(2\u03c0i) Res\n4\u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n4\n,z = \u2212 2\n1/2\nb +1\nz(Q(z))\n\n\u0013\n\n= 1,\n\n(5.29)\n\nsince the residue turns out to be \u22122i, and so is independent of b. The deformed contour goes\nalong the positive real axis, starting at +\u221e on the lower side, and ending at +\u221e on the upper\nside of the real axis. It gives the contribution\n!\nZ +\u221e\n1\n1\n1\n\u2212\ndz.\n\u2212\n1/2\n1/2\n4\u03c0 0\nz(Q(z))+\nz(Q(z))\u2212\np\n\u221a\n1/2\n1/2\nWith our choice (5.28) of square root we have (Q(z))+ = \u2212(Q(z))\u2212 = Q(z) where * is the\npositive square root of a real and positive number. So the contribution from the positive real\nline is the integral\nZ +\u221e\n1\ndz\np\n\u2212\n2\u03c0 0\nz Q(z)\nand this integral we already calculated in (5.22) and (5.24).
