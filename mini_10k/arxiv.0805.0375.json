I NTRODUCTION\nThe ability to ensure transmission confidentiality is becoming a crucial requirement of many wireless communications systems due to the increasing role of on-line transactions and new applications that exchange critical\npersonal data. In information-theoretic terms, perfect security (or confidentiality) implies the impossibility for a given\neavesdropping terminal to harness any information about the transmitted message from its received signal [1]. This\ncondition implies an even stronger guarantee than traditional cryptography, where security relies on the computational\nlimitations of the eavesdropper (also referred to as the wiretap).\nAnalysis of transmission strategies that are able to meet the requirement of perfect security in wireless networks\nis currently an active area of research. As a brief and partial review of available literature, we first recall that,\nfollowing the basic definitions given in [1] of a wiretap channel (consisting of a single source-destination pair\nand an eavesdropper), perfect security in a Gaussian wiretap channel with no fading was studied in [2]. More\nrecently, attention has turned to the investigation of the corresponding fading scenario [13] [14], and to multi-user/\nmulti-antenna Gaussian models [3]-[8]. In particular, the Gaussian multiple-access wiretap channel was studied in\n[3], the multiple access with confidential messages in [4], the broadcast channel in [5] (parallel broadcast channels)\nand [6] (multi-antenna broadcast channels), and the single-link Gaussian MIMO case in [7] [8].\nIn this paper, we focus on secure communications for cellular systems, motivated by the fact that most of\nconfidential transactions are expected to be conducted over such networks in the near future. Specifically, a novel\n\nOctober 9, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f2\n\nbackbone\n\nC\n\nB\n\nD\nE\nA\n\nFig. 1. Illustration of a system with cooperating base stations B and C, an uplink terminal A, an eavesdropping mobile station E and a dowlink\nuser D.\n\nbasic approach to ensuring confidentiality is proposed that exploits uplink/ downlink scheduling of transmissions in\nadjacent cells and cooperation at the base station (BS) level. In so doing, we follow on the line of research opened\nby [10], where it was shown that cooperative transmission, beside being able to improve throughput or reliability\n(see, e.g., [9]), can also be instrumental in enhancing the confidentiality of transmission (for a basic relay network).\nBS cooperation is currently being widely investigated as a key enabler for high-data rate infrastructure networks\n(see, e.g., [12] [11]), and is enabled by the presence of high-capacity backbone links connecting the BSs. The\nmain contribution of this work is to show that such technology can also bring significant gains in terms of secure\ncommunications.\nThe proposed techniques aim at securing uplink transmissions from terminals to a given BS. The basic idea is\nto schedule downlink BS transmissions at the same time as the concurrent uplink transmissions of interest, so as\nto create intentional interference on the possible eavesdroppers. Cooperation at the BS level is then used to convey\ninformation about the downlink transmission to the uplink-operated BS (uplink) over a finite\u2013capacity backbone.\nThis enables the uplink-operated BS to partially mitigate interference from the BS transmission. The approach is\nsimilar to [15] [16] [10] [17], where artificial noise jams the reception of the eavesdropper, while using techniques to\navoid interference at the intended receiver. In [15] this interference mitigation is obtained by exploiting the structure\nand reciprocity of multi-antenna fading channels, while [16] [17] leverage a infinite-capacity backbone between\nreceiving and jamming antennas. We propose several new schemes based on the above mentioned basic idea, each\nof them using a combined wireless/backbone transmission. The schemes and the corresponding achievable rates are\ninvestigated and compared via analysis and simulations.\nII. S YSTEM M ODEL AND BACKGROUND\nIn this section, we fist introduce the scenario of interest and relevant quantities, and then investigate the reference\ncase where no infrastructure is present to enable cooperation between the BSs.\n\nOctober 9, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f3\n\nA. Scenario\nWe focus on two adjacent cells served by single-antennas BSs as in Fig. 1 (the contribution of other cells is\nconsidered implicitly as additive noise), where the two BSs are connected by a high capacity, typically wired,\nbackbone link. The BSs are termed B and C, respectively. Terminal A within the first cell has a message to\ndeliver to B under constraints of confidentiality with respect to the activity of an eavesdropping terminal E. The\neavesdropper is assumed to be within the transmission range of terminal A, as otherwise it would not pose any\nthreat to the confidentiality of A's message, but also of the adjacent BS C. The main idea behind the considered\ntransmission strategy is that the uplink transmission from A to B can be scheduled at the same time as the downlink\ntransmission from C towards a given terminal D in its range. Hence, the transmission from C effectively acts as\na jammer on the reception at E. Note this approach is not intended to secure the communication C \u2212 D. Also,\nnotice that jamming is thereby accomplished without exploiting any additional system resource since it is obtained\nfrom a regular downlink transmission.\n1) System Model: Formally, terminal A randomly selects a rate-RA message WA from the set {1, ..., 2nRA }, and\nencodes it via a sequence of n complex channel inputs XA = [XA,1 * * * XA,n ] \u2208 Cn with normalized average power\nconstraint E[|XA,i |2 ] = PA . Encoding takes place through a (possibly stochastic) mapping: XA : {1, ..., 2nRA }\u2192 Cn\n[1] [2]. Notice that vectors of n symbols are represented throughout the paper by bold letters. At the same time,\nBS C transmits a rate-RC downlink message WC , randomly selected from the set {1, ..., 2nRC }, with an average\npower of PC . The actual codebook used by C is assumed to be subject to design and thus depends on the specific\ncooperative strategy employed by BSs B and C. This will be specified for different proposed techniques in the\nfollowing sections. The capacity of the backbone link is denoted by CL and is measured in bit/symbol. We consider\nbandwidth that is normalized to 1 Hz, such that bit/symbol is equivalent to bit/second (bps). We assume full\nsynchronization between the transmissions of A and C at the receiver of B. Finally, to account for a worst-case\nscenario, synchronization is also assumed at the receiver of eavesdropping terminal E, and the latter is endowed\nwith information about the codebooks used by A and C.\nThe complex channel coefficient between any two nodes U and V is denoted by hU V , while the i\u2212th symbol\ntransmitted by node U is denoted by XU,i (U \u2208 {A, C} and V \u2208 {B, D, E}). The signal received by B and E,\nrespectively, at the i\u2212th symbol (i = 1, ..., n) reads:\nYB,i = hAB XA,i + hCB XC,i + NB,i\n\n(1)\n\nYE,i = hAE XA,i + hCE XC,i + NE,i\n\n(2)\n\nEach noise component NV,i is a complex Gaussian white noise with unit power, so that if the node U transmits\nwith power PU , the corresponding received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the node V is:\n\u03b3U V = PU |hU V |2 .\n\n(3)\n\nIn the most of the paper (Sec. III-VI), we focus on Gaussian (unfaded) channels, where the channel gains (3) are\nfixed and deterministic. In practice, these rates can be achieved, for given channel realizations, when channel state\nOctober 9, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f4\n\ninformation is known at the receiver side, and all the channel gains of interest (hAB , hCB , hAE , hCE ) are known\nto terminal A, while the channel gains hCB and hCD are known to the downlink-operated BS C. In Sec. VII, the\nanalysis will be extended to a fading scenario under different assumptions on the channel state information at the\ntransmitters' side.\nFinally, the BS B decodes through a mapping g(YB ): Cn \u2192 {1, ..., 2nRA }. According to standard definitions\n[1] [2], a rate RA = RA,s is said to be achievable with perfect secrecy with respect to eavesdropper E if, as the\nnumber of samples per coding block n \u2192 \u221e: (a) the decoding error at BS B vanishes:\nPe = P [g(YB ) 6= WA ] \u2192 0;\n\n(4)\n\n(b) the uncertainty (equivocation) \u2206 of eavesdropper E regarding A's message, measured as the conditional entropy\nof WA given the signal received by E normalized over the unconditional entropy, satisfies:\n\u2206=\n\nH(WA |YE )\n\u2192 1.\nH(WA )\n\n(5)\n\nB. Some Useful Functions\nTo simplify the presentation of the results in this paper, it is useful to define the following two functions. The\nfirst function C(\u03b3U V ) is the standard capacity of a Gaussian single link with source U and receiver V, and SNR\nequal to \u03b3U V :\nC(\u03b3U V ) = log(1 + \u03b3U V ).\n\n(6)\n\nThe second function SU1 V (RU2 ) pertains to the performance of a multiple\u2013access channel (MAC) with two users\nU1 and U2 and receiver V. It measures the supremum of the achievable rates from U1 to V for a given transmission\nrate RU2 of U2 . Notice that rate RU2 is not restricted to be within the MAC capacity region, that is, it is not\nnecessarily decodable by V. Given the SNRs \u03b3U1 V and \u03b3U2 V , the function is given by:\n8\n>\nC(\u03b3U1 V )\n>\n>\n<\nSU1 V (RU2 ) =\nC(\u03b3U1 V + \u03b3U2 V ) \u2212 RU2\n>\n\"\n\" \u03b3\n>\n>\nU1 V\n:\nC 1+\u03b3\nU V\n2\n\n\" \u03b3\n\"\nU2 V\nif RU2 \u2264 C 1+\u03b3\n\" \u03b3\n\" U1 V\nU2 V\nif C 1+\u03b3\n< RU2 \u2264 C(\u03b3U2 V ) .\nU V\n\n(7)\n\n1\n\nif RU2 > C(\u03b3U2 V )\n\nC. Perfect Secrecy Without Backbone Link (CL = 0)\nHere, we briefly discuss the baseline scenario where no backbone link exists between BSs B and C (CL = 0).\nIn such a case, no cooperation via the backbone link is possible, and we assume that the BS C transmits with a\nstandard Gaussian codebook XC (WC ) = [XC,1 (WC ) * * * XC,n (WC )] \u2208 Cn , where variables XC,i are generated\nas complex Gaussian independent with zero mean and power PC . As explained above, this codebook conveys\ninformation to a downlink user D. Given this set-up, it can be readily seen that the considered approach coincides\nwith the strategy considered in [10] under the name Noise\u2013Forwarding (NF). It was shown therein that the secrecy\ncapacity can be found by considering the compound multiple access channel (MAC), with two receivers B and E\nand two transmitters A and C. In particular, for the Gaussian case of interest here, and using the function (7), the\nresult of [10] (Theorem 3) can be restated as follows.\nOctober 9, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f5\n\nProposition 1: If BS C transmits in downlink with rate RC and there is no backbone link (CL = 0), the rate\nRA,s (RC ) is achievable with perfect secrecy with respect to eavesdropper E 1 :\n+\n\nRA,s (RC ) = (SAB (RC ) \u2212 SAE (RC )) ,\n\n(8)\n\nwith SAB (RC ) and SAE (RC ) defined in (7).\nFrom (8) it can be seen that an increase in the secrecy rate can be obtained by either increasing the achievable\nrate SAB (RC ) to the intended destination B or hampering reception of the eavesdropper (decreasing SAE (RC )).\nIII. P ERFECT S ECRECY WITH L ARGE -C APACITY BACKHAUL L INK (CL \u2265 RC )\nWe now turn to the interesting case where the backhaul link has a capacity larger than the downlink rate,\nCL \u2265 RC . As in the baseline case considered above, we assume that BS C transmits codewords from a given\nrate-RC randomly generated Gaussian codebook. Since CL \u2265 RC , BS C can communicate the current codeword\nXC (WC ) to the adjacent BS B by using the backbone link. Therefore, BS B can effectively cancel the interference\nsignal XC (WC ) from the received signal (1), leading to the equivalent received signal\nYB,i = hAB XA,i + NB,i .\n\n(9)\n\nSAB (RC ) = SAB (0) = C(\u03b3AB ),\n\n(10)\n\nThis implies that for any RC we have:\n\nfrom which the following proposition easily follows.\nProposition 2: If BS C transmits in downlink with rate RC and CL \u2265 RC , the rate RA,s (RC ) is achievable\nwith perfect secrecy:\nRA,s (RC ) = (C(\u03b3AB ) \u2212 SAE (RC ))\n\n+\n\n(11)\n\nwith SAE (RC ) defined in (7).\nProof : Follows directly from Theorem 3 of [10] (see discussion in Sec. II-C).\nThe rate (11) is plotted in Fig. 2 along with the capacity of the direct link C(\u03b3AB ) and the maximum achievable\nrate at the eavesdropper SAE (RC ) for \u03b3AB = 7, \u03b3AE = 15, \u03b3CE = 10. A relevant quantity that can be observed\nfrom the figure is the rate Rx = C(\u03b3AB ) \u2212 RA,s . This can be interpreted as the rate loss that terminal A must\nsacrifice to the aim of \"confounding\" the eavesdropper E and thus achieving rate RA,s with perfect secrecy. For\nthis particular example, when RC = 0, the single\u2013user link A \u2212 E is less noisy than the link A \u2212 B and therefore\nthe secrecy capacity is zero. As the downlink rate RC increases, while the achievable rate C(\u03b3AB ) on the link\nA \u2212 B is clearly unaffected (see (9)), the rate decodable by the eavesdropper SAE (RC ) decreases (for RC large\nenough), and thus a positive secrecy rate is obtained as soon as SAE (RC ) < C(\u03b3AB ). In particular, the secrecy rate\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0011+\n\u03b3AE\nRA,s increases linearly with RC until it reaches the maximum value C(\u03b3AB ) \u2212 C 1+\u03b3\nfor RC \u2265 C(\u03b3CE ).\nCE\n1 We\n\ndefine (x)+ = x if x > 0 and (x)+ = 0 otherwise.\n\nOctober 9, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f6\n\nRA,s\nC(\u03b3AB)\n\nR\n\nA\n\nSAE(RC)\n\nR\n\nx\n\nC(\u03b3CE/(1+\u03b3AE))\n\nR\n\nC\n\nC(\u03b3\n\n)\n\nCE\n\nFig. 2. The achievable secrecy rate RA,s in Proposition 2. Here Rx = C(\u03b3AB )\u2212RA,s is the amount of information spent by A to \"confound\"\nthe eavesdropper E in order to achieve a rate RA,s with perfect secrecy.\n\nIt can be easily seen that this value of RA,s corresponds to the case where the signal from C acts as a Gaussian\nnoise with power \u03b3CE , which is known to be worst\u2013case jammer on E (see, e.g., [20]).\nFinally, two remarks on the case at hand of large-capacity backbone link (CL \u2265 RC ) are in order, that will be\ncompared in the next sections with the complementary case where CL < RC . (a) With a large-capacity backbone,\nthe secrecy rate RA,s is a non-decreasing function of the downlink rate RC . (b) With a large-capacity backbone,\nthe value of the inter-BS channel gain \u03b3CB is irrelevant to the system performance. This clearly contrasts with the\ncase of CL = 0 studied in Sec. II-C: for instance, for the chosen SNRs in the example on Fig. 2, if in addition we\nassume \u03b3CB \u2264 \u03b3CE , it can be seen from (8) that with CL = 0 the secrecy rate RA,s is identically zero.\nIV. Q UANTIZATION \u2013 BASED T RANSMISSION S TRATEGIES\nIn this section, we start the analysis of the secrecy capacity for the case where the backbone link capacity is\nsmaller than the downlink rate, CL < RC . In such as case, different strategies can be devised by the BS C in order\nto provide the adjacent BS B with some information about the downlink transmitted waveform XC in order to\nenable interference mitigation at B and thus improve the secrecy rate RA,s (recall the discussion about (8)). In this\nsection, we describe two strategies based on source coding arguments (quantization) for transferring information\nfrom C to B, while the next section proposes strategies based on channel coding principles. For the strategies\nconsidered in this section, we assume, as above, that the BS C employs a standard randomly generated Gaussian\ncodebook.\nA. Elementary Quantization\nThe first considered approach is based on quantizing the downlink codeword XC (WC ) via a rate-CL Gaussian\ncodebook. Quantization/compression is done by using standard joint typicality-based vector quantization [19] and\nOctober 9, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f7\n\ndoes not exploit here any side information available at the receiver (elementary quantization). Given its optimality\nin a rate-distortion sense, here we consider a Gaussian test channel, which we represent for convenience in the\nforward form [18]:\nX\u0302C,i = XC,i + Qi ,\n\n(12)\n\n2\nwhere Qi is i.i.d. complex Gaussian quantization noise with power \u03c3Q\n. From basic rate-distortion theory, it follows\n\nthat the following condition should be satisfied:\nI(XC ; X\u0302C ) = CL\n\n(13)\n\nwhich, as mentioned above, reflects the fact that the quantization process at C is oblivious to the fact that there\n2\nis a parallel wireless link between C and B that conveys side information. The quantization error power \u03c3Q\ncan\n\u0001\n2\nCL\n2\nthen be found from (13) as \u03c3Q = PC /(2 \u2212 1) (since I(XC ; X\u0302C ) = log2 1 + PC /\u03c3Q ), so that the SNR on the\n\nequivalent channel (12) reads\n\u03b3Q =\n\nPC\n= 2CL \u2212 1.\n\u03c3q2\n\n(14)\n\nIt is remarked that the quantization codebook is assumed to be known to the BS B, which uses the received index\nfrom the backbone link to decompress the signal into X\u0302C . The following proposition provides the rate achievable\nwith this strategy (see proof in Appendix-A).\nProposition 3: If BS C transmits in downlink with rate RC , the elementary quantization-based strategy achieves\nwith perfect secrecy the rate RA,s (RC ) given by:\n\u0010\n\u0011+\nEQ\nRA,s (RC ) = SAB\n(RC ) \u2212 SAE (RC )\n\n(15)\n\nwith SAE (RC ) defined in (7),\n\nand Csum = log2\n\n\uf8f1\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03b3CB\n\uf8f4\nC(\u03b3\n)\nif\nR\n\u2264\nC\n+\n\u03b3\n\uf8f4\nAB\nC\nQ\n1+\u03b3AB\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u0010\n\u0011\nEQ\n\u03b3\nCB\nSAB (RC ) =\nCsum \u2212 RC if C 1+\u03b3AB + \u03b3Q < RC \u2264 C(\u03b3CB + \u03b3Q )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 C\nif RC > C(\u03b3CB + \u03b3Q )\nsum \u2212 C(\u03b3CB + \u03b3Q )\n\u0001\n2CL (1 + \u03b3AB ) + \u03b3CB .\n\n(16)\n\nIt can seen that, unlike the large-backbone case of Proposition 2, here the achievable rate (15) is not a monoEQ\ntonically increasing function of RC since the latter affects (decreases) also SAB\n(RC ). Moreover, it can be shown\n\nthat only for CL \u2192 \u221e, the rate (15) tends to the large-backbone secrecy rate (11) due to the residual quantization\nnoise for any finite CL . In practice (and in our evaluations in Sections VI and VII, whenever the instantaneous rate\nRC \u2265 CL , then we do not use quantization, but transfer the message completely over the backhaul.\nB. Wyner\u2013Ziv Quantization\nThe approach presented above can be improved by designing the quantization scheme according to Wyner-Ziv\ncompression with side information at the decoder [21] (Wyner-Ziv quantization). In fact, the wireless signal YB\n\nOctober 9, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f8\n\nreceived by BS B is correlated with the signal XC transmitted by BS C and can thus be used as side information\nat the decoder. From [21], the following relationship should now hold:\nI(XC ; X\u0302C |YB ) = CL .\n\n(17)\n\n2\nBy using the Gaussian forward test channel (12), the power of the quantization noise \u03c3Q\nand the respective equivalent\n\nquantization SNR \u03b3Q can be easily derived (see Appendix-B) leading to the equivalent SNR\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b3CB\nPC\n\u03b3Q = 2 = (2CL \u2212 1) 1 +\n.\n\u03c3q\n1 + \u03b3AB\n\n(18)\n\nAchievable rates with Wyner-Ziv compression then follow directly from Proposition 3 by simply replacing \u03b3Q in\n(14) with (18). It is noted that if \u03b3CB = 0, this scheme has clearly no advantage over the elementary quantization\nconsidered above due to the absence of useful side information at the receiver.\nV. S UPERPOSITION C ODING - BASED T RANSMISSION S TRATEGIES\nHere we investigate a channel coding-based strategy to exploit the backbone link with capacity satisfying the\ncondition CL < RC . The strategy is based on rate\u2013splitting encoding at BS C so that, differently from the previous\nsections, here C changes the format of its wireless transmission to facilitate the transfer of information over the\nbackbone. It is also noted that this assumption requires downlink terminal D to modify its decoding strategy\naccordingly (see details below). The message WC is transmitted by sending two independent messages WC1 , WC2\nwith rates RC1 , RC2 , respectively such that:\nRC = RC1 + RC2 ,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere RC is determined by the capacity of the downlink transmission by C:\nRC = C(\u03b3CD ).\n\n(20)\n\nThe two messages are combined by using superposition coding, such that the ith symbol sent by C is:\nXC,i =\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03b1XC1,i +\n\n\u221a\n\n1 \u2212 \u03b1XC2,i ,\n\n(21)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the power\u2013division coefficient and 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1. Notice that, unlike the previously described quantizationbased scheme, here the downlink channel gain \u03b3CD plays an important role, since any modification in the design\nof the transmission scheme at BS C (i.e., rates (RC1 , RC2 ) and coefficient \u03b1) has to guarantee successful decoding\nat terminal D. To elaborate, we assume that decoding at D is carried out via successive interference cancellation,\nsuch that WC1 is first decoded and subtracted and then WC2 is decoded. Such a decoding imposes the following\nconditions on rates (RC1 , RC2 ) and coefficient \u03b1:\n\u0012\nRC1 = log2\n\n\u03b1\u03b3CD\n1+\n1 + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)\u03b3CD\n\nRC2 = log2 (1 + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)\u03b3CD ).\n\nOctober 9, 2018\n\n\u0013\n(22)\n(23)\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f9\n\nIt can be easily seen that for any 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1, condition (20) is satisfied (RC1 + RC2 = C(\u03b3CD )) and we have\nfreedom to chose \u03b1.\nThe basic idea of this strategy is to send one of the messages, either WC1 or WC2 (i.e., either the one decoded\nfirst or last by downlink user D), over the backbone. This implies either RC1 = CL or RC2 = CL , respectively. It\nis noted that once either of the latter condition is specified, this choice, by way of (22)-(23), uniquely determines\nthe value of \u03b1 and, from (19), the remaining rate. As we will see in the next sections, the choice of which message\nto send over the backbone drastically impact the achievable secrecy rate, and neither strategy dominates the other.\nA. Sending the Message Decoded Last by D (WC2 )\nIn this first case, we set RC2 = CL , which, from (23), determines the following value of \u03b1:\n\u03b1 = \u03b12 = 1 \u2212\n\n2CL \u2212 1\n,\n\u03b3CD\n\n(24)\n\nand the rate RC1 = RC \u2212 CL . BS B can then uses WC2 to cancel XC2 (WC2 ) from its wireless received signal\nYB , such that the resulting received wireless signal at B at the instance i is given by:\n\u221a\nYB,i = hAB XA,i + hCB \u03b12 XC1,i + NB,i .\n\n(25)\n\nThe following lemma follows (see proof in Appendix-C).\nLemma 1: If BS C transmits in downlink with rate RC using the superposition coding scheme with (24), the\nmaximum rate achievable on the link A-B is given by:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 min{C(\u03b3AB ), C(\u03b3AB + \u03b12 \u03b3CB ) \u2212 (RC \u2212 CL )}\n(\u03b1 )\n\u0010\n\u0011\nSAB2 (RC ) =\n\u03b3AB\n\uf8f3 C\n1+\u03b12 \u03b3CB\n\nif RC \u2212 CL < C(\u03b12 \u03b3CB )\n\n(26)\n\notherwise\n\nB. Sending the Message Decoded First by D (WC1 )\nWhen WC1 is sent over the backbone, we set RC1 = CL , resulting in\n\u03b1 = \u03b11 =\n\n1 \u2212 2\u2212CL\n1 \u2212 1/(1 + \u03b3CD )\n\n(27)\n\nand RC2 = RC \u2212 CL . After cancelling out XC1 (WC1 ), the multiple access channel at B is given as:\nYB,i = hAB XA,i + hCB (1 \u2212\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03b11 )XC2,i + NB,i .\n\n(28)\n\nThe following result follows from the same arguments as in Appendix-C.\nLemma 2: If BS C transmits in downlink with rate RC using the superposition coding scheme with (27), the\nmaximum rate achievable on the link A-B is given by:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 min{C(\u03b3AB ), C(\u03b3AB + (1 \u2212 \u03b11 )\u03b3CB ) \u2212 (RC \u2212 CL )}\n(\u03b1 )\n\u0010\n\u0011\nSAB1 (RC ) =\n\u03b3AB\n\uf8f3 C\n1+(1\u2212\u03b11 )\u03b3CB\n\nOctober 9, 2018\n\nif RC \u2212 CL < C((1 \u2212 \u03b11 )\u03b3CB )\n\n(29)\n\notherwise\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f10\n\nC. Achievable Secrecy Rate with Superposition Coding\nAccounting for both options of sending either WC1 or WC2 over the backbone, we can now state the following\nresult.\nProposition 4: If BS C transmits in downlink with rate RC , the superposition-based strategy achieves the\nfollowing rate RA,s (RC ) with perfect secrecy:\n\"\n\"+\nSU P\nRA,s (RC ) = SAB\n(RC ) \u2212 SAE (RC )\n\n(30)\n\nn\no\n(\u03b1 )\nSU P\nSAB\n(RC ) = max SABi (RC ) ,\n\n(31)\n\nwith\ni=1,2\n\n(\u03b1 )\n\nwhere SABi (RC ) are defined in (26) and (29), and SAE (RC ) is given by (7).\n\nThe proposition follows from Lemmas 2 and 1 and similar arguments as in the proof of Proposition 1 [10]. In\nparticular, following such arguments, one should calculate the maximum rate decodable by the eavesdropper E for\ngiven RC and for the rate splitting strategy. It can be shown that this maximum rate is indeed SAE (RC ) as in (30),\nthat is, it is the same rate that we would have if BS C had used a single-rate Gaussian codebook. This is because\nfrom (19),(22), and (23), it can be proved that any of the superposed messages is decodable if and only if the other\nis.\nA final remark concerns a comparison between the superposition strategy and elementary quantization. It can be\nshown by comparing (30) and (16) (with (14)) that for downlink rate RC \u2192 \u221e the performance of both scheme\nEQ\nSU P\n(RC ) \u2192 SAB\n(RC ) = Csum \u2212 C(\u03b3CB + \u03b3Q ).\ncoincide since SAB\n\nD. Some Comments on the Superposition Strategy\nThe achievable secrecy rate (30) contains a maximization over the choice of which message should be sent over\nthe backhaul link. This choice is made so as to optimize the maximum achievable rate on the link A-B (31). In\nthis regard, some general conclusion can be drawn by noticing that from the assumption RC = C(\u03b3CD ) \u2265 CL it\ncan be verified that\n\u03b12 \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03b11 .\n\n(32)\n\nThen the following observations can be made:\n\u2022\n\nFor large downlink rates RC , such that:\n(a)\n\nRC \u2265 CL + C(\u03b12 \u03b3CB ) = C(2CL \u03b3CB ) \u2265 CL + C((1 \u2212 \u03b11 )\u03b3CB )\nwhere (a) follows from (32)it follows from Lemmas 1 and 2 that\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b3AB\n\u03b3AB\n(\u03b1 )\n(\u03b1 )\nSAB2 (RC ) = C\n\u2264C\n= SAB1 (RC )\n1 + \u03b12 \u03b3CB\n1 + (1 \u2212 \u03b11 )\u03b3CB\n\n(33)\n\n(34)\n\nwhich means that sending XC1 over the backbone offers higher achievable rates RA .\n\u2022\n\nFor low downlink rates RC , such that:\nRC \u2264 CL + C((1 \u2212 \u03b11 )\u03b3CB ) =\u2264 CL + C(\u03b12 \u03b3CB )\n\nOctober 9, 2018\n\n(35)\nDRAFT\n\n\f11\n\nit follows from Lemmas 1 and 2 that\n(\u03b1 )\n\n=\n\nmin{C(\u03b3AB ), C(\u03b3AB + \u03b12 \u03b3CB ) \u2212 (RC \u2212 CL )}\n\n(\u03b1 )\n\n=\n\nmin{C(\u03b3AB ), C(\u03b3AB + (1 \u2212 \u03b11 )\u03b3CB ) \u2212 (RC \u2212 CL )}\n\nSAB2 (RC )\nSAB1 (RC )\nthus\n\n(\u03b1 )\n\n(\u03b1 )\n\nSAB2 (RC ) \u2265 SAB1 (RC )\n\n(36)\n\nwhich means that sending XC2 over the backbone offers higher achievable rates RA .\nWe give an intuitive explanation of the previous result. Note that if a signal contains two superposed messages and\none of those messages is known a priori, then this is equivalent to cancelling power from the composite message.\n\u221a\nFor example, if in (21) the message WC1 is known, then we cancel the signal \u03b1XC1 , which corresponds to the\npower of \u03b1PC . Now we can ask the following question: If we fix the condition RC1 + RC2 = RC and we set one\nof the rates (RC1 or RC2 ) to be equal to CL , then in which case we can cancel the maximal amount of power\nfrom the composite message? From the previous discussions, if RCj = CL then we determine \u03b1 = \u03b1j . If WC2\nis sent over the backhaul then j = 2 and the amount of power cancelled is (1 \u2212 \u03b12 )PC . If j = 1, the amount\nof power cancelled is \u03b11 PC . Hence, using the condition (32), we conclude that sending WC2 over the backhaul\nimplies minimal possible cancellation of power from the composite message (and thus at the receiver B) and the\nremaining power of the wireless signal from C at B is largest possible. At relatively low RC , this effect increases\nthe interval of values for RC that are completely decodable at B and that is why sending WC2 over the backhaul\ngives higher achievable rate SAB (RC ). However, when the rate RC is large and thus not completely decodable at\nB, then XC1 acts as a noise and such a high remaining power harms the rate achievable for large RC . On the other\nhand, when WC1 is sent over the backbone, the uncancelled part of the composite message has minimum possible\npower, which is desirable when that portion of the signal sent by C is undecodable and has to be treated as noise.\nVI. N UMERICAL E XAMPLES\nIn this section we provide some numerical examples for the performance of the proposed confidential transmission\nschemes when all the wireless channels are deterministic (unfaded), as assumed in the previous sections. We\nwill use the following acronyms: EQ for Elementary Quantization, WZ for Wyner\u2013Ziv quantization, and SUP for\ntransmission based on superposition coding. In the cases RC \u2264 CL , the message from C is completely transferred\nvia the backhaul, such that all the schemes behave identically.\nWe start by considering the maximum achievable rates with no confidentiality constrains from terminal A to BS\n(\u03b1 )\n\n(\u03b1 )\n\nEQ\nEQ\n1\n2\nB, namely SAB\n(RC ) (16) (14); SW\nZ (RC ) (16) (18); SAB (RC ) (29) and SAB (RC ) (26). Fig. 3 depicts such\n\nrates versus the downlink rate RC . For the chosen parameters (\u03b3AB = \u03b3CB = 10 [dB] and CL = 2 [bps]), WZ\nis to be preferred for any value of the downlink rate RC . Moreover, by appropriately selecting which message is\n(\u03b1 )\n\n(\u03b1 )\n\nsent over the backbone (WC1 or WC2 ), that is choosing between SAB1 (RC ) and SAB2 (RC ), the SUP strategy\noutperforms the EQ for any RC . On this note, confirming the discussion of Sec. 3, we have that for lower RC it is\n(\u03b1 )\n\n(\u03b1 )\n\nmore convenient to send WC2 over the backbone (SAB2 (RC ) > SAB1 (RC )) and viceversa for larger RC .

V-C, if the rate RC is large enough, the EQ strategy obtains a constant\nsecrecy rate RC , which coincides with the asymptotic achievable for of the SUP strategy.\nFig. 4 shows the achievable rate without confidentiality constraints (as Fig. 3) versus the SNR between the BSs\n\u03b3CB . Here it can be seen that, for low values of \u03b3CB the SUP strategy outperforms the WZ strategy. The U-shape\nof all the curves versus \u03b3CB can be explained similarly to the arguments used to study interference channels with\nwith weak and strong interference. Consider for instance the case CL = 0. For low \u03b3CB , BS B cannot decode RC ,\nbut the wireless interference from C at B is weak, which makes the achievable rate A \u2212 B high. As \u03b3CB increases,\nbut still not sufficiently as to make rate RC decodable at B, the achievable rate on link A \u2212 B drops.

Note that with such a choice of SNRs the Noise\u2013Forwarding strategy [10]\n(CL = 0) offers a zero secrecy rate, which implies that in this case the presence of the backbone offers markedly\nimproved secrecy. Moreover, for small downlink rates RC , all proposed strategies have the same achievable secrecy\nrate as in the case of large backbone capacity studied in Sec. III (CL > RC ) up to a certain value of RC , which\nis the largest for the WZ strategy. Finally, as pointed out above, WZ offers substantial gains with respect to EQ,\nand, given the large value of \u03b3CB in this example, also with respect to SUP (where SUP and EQ have the same\nperformance for large RC ).\nVII. E XTENSION TO FADING C HANNELS\nIn this section, we turn the attention to fading channels and reconsider the performance of the proposed transmission strategies under different assumptions regarding the channel state information available at different nodes.\nA. Scenario and Performance Measures\nThe inter-BS link C \u2212 B is considered to be a line\u2013of\u2013sight and thus does not experience fading, i. e., \u03b3CB is\nconstant, while the other links are faded. We assume that a fading link hU V features Rayleigh fading, such that\nthe SNR of the link \u03b3U V is independently and exponentially distributed with average value \u03b3\u0304U V . Furthermore, we\nconsider block fading, such that a fading channel stays constant for a sufficient number of symbols n, where for\ncoding purposes n can be assumed to be infinity. It is noted that the assumption regarding the inter-BS link \u03b3CB\nis a reasonable if, e.g., the BSs are sufficiently elevated with respect to the rest of the network. As far as channel\nOctober 9, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f14\n\nstate information is concerned, terminal A is assumed to know the channel gains \u03b3AB (and the constant \u03b3CB ),\nbeside the downlink rate RC , so that it can calculate (and transmit at) the maximum instantaneous achievable rate\nSAB (RC ) in (7). Other assumptions will be differently specified below for two scenarios, one in which we measure\nthe outage probability and the other in which we assess the scheduling performance.\n1) No Channel State Information about E: Outage Probability: This scenario relies on the realistic assumption\nthat the instantaneous fading channel to the eavesdropper \u03b3AE and \u03b3CE are not known to terminal A and BS C. In\nsuch a case, no non-zero rate is achievable with perfect secrecy, and therefore we one has to resort to the concept of\noutage probability [13], [17]. In particular, given a target secrecy rate RA,s , the outage probability is defined as the\nprobability that such RA,s is not achievable for the given transmission technique. It is noted that, for each fading\nrealization, the value of RC is selected is here selected as (20), which requires BS C to know the instantaneous\ndownlink channel \u03b3CD \u2212 D.\n2) Full Channel State Information: Scheduling Performance: In this second scenario, we assume full channel\nstate information about all the fading channels at both terminal A and BS C know. Given the full channel state\ninformation, it is relevant here to generalize the model to include Mu uplink users A1 , A2 , . . .

The goal is to analyze the\nimpact of different scheduling and transmission strategies on the performance of the network at hand over fading\nchannels. As throughout the paper, of particular interest is the impact of design choices on the trade-off between\nthe downlink (RC ) and the uplink secrecy rate (RA,s ).\nRegarding uplink scheduling, we assume that the uplink user Ai\u2217 is selected so as to maximize the uplink rate:\ni\u2217 = max \u03b3Ai B\n\n(37)\n\ni\n\nMore interesting is the scheduling of the downlink transmissions from C, for which we define two different types\nof schedulers:\n\u2022\n\nMaxRC scheduler: In this case the scheduled user Dj\u2217 is selected so as to maximize the downlink rate:\nj \u2217 = max \u03b3CDj\nj\n\n\u2022\n\n(38)\n\nMaxSec scheduler: In this case the selection of the user Dj \u2217 is done so as to maximize the uplink secrecy\nrate RA,s . Accordingly, the selection of Dj \u2217 depends on which method is used by C to communicate over the\nbackbone. If WZ quantization is used, the scheduler is denoted M axSecW Z and we have:\nWZ\nj \u2217,W Z = max RA,s\n(log2 (1 + \u03b3CDj )),\nj\n\n(39)\n\nwhile if superposition is used, the scheduler is denoted M axSecSU P and:\nsup\nj \u2217,SU P = max RA,s\n(log2 (1 + \u03b3CDj )).\nj\n\n(40)\n\nNote that, in general j \u2217,W Z 6= j \u2217,SU P . Moreover, notice that only the WZ strategy has been considered among the\nquantization schemes to simplify the discussion and given the superior performance with respect to EQ. Performance\nevaluation is then carried out by calculating the average secrecy rate R\u0304A,s (S) and the average downlink rate R\u0304C (S),\nOctober 9, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f15\n\nR\n\n=1 [bps]\n\nA,s\n\n0.9\n0.8\n\nSUP\nEQ\nWZQ\n\nPC=0\n\nProbability of outage\n\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\nC \u2265R\nL\n\n0.3\n\nC\n\nC =\u221e, R =\u221e\n\n0.2\n0.1\n\nL\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nC\n\n3\n\n4\nCL [bps]\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nFig. 6.

Numerical Results\nWe now present some numerical results for the two considered scenarios.\n1) Outage Probability: Fig. 6 depicts the outage probability as a function of the backbone capacity CL for\n\u03b3\u0304AB = \u03b3\u0304AE = \u03b3\u0304CE = \u03b3\u0304CD = 15 [dB], \u03b3CB = 15 [dB], RA,s = 1 [bps]. We recall that the value RC is selected\naccording to the instantaneous SNR \u03b3CD as (20). The line CL \u2265 RC is obtained by assuming that CL is large\nenough to can accommodate any rate RC (strictly speaking, CL \u2192 \u221e). It can be seen that, as CL increases, the\noutage probability of all the strategies approaches this asymptotic performance, as it becomes highly probable that\nthe given CL can accommodate the rate C(\u03b3CD ). The lower bound on the outage probability is obtained by assuming\nthat C sends pure Gaussian noise (which is the worst jamming signal, see, e.g., [20]), that is perfectly transferred\nthrough the backbone (CL = \u221e, RC = \u221e). Another reference performance is set by the case PC = 0, where no\ndownlink transmission takes place. For low values of CL , the proposed schemes can actually be outperformed by\nsuch solution. This is because, for low CL , the downlink transmission impairs not only reception at the eavesdropper\nE, but also at the BS B.\nFig. 7 depicts the outage probability as a function of the inter-BS SNR \u03b3CB for \u03b3\u0304AB = \u03b3\u0304AE = \u03b3\u0304CE = \u03b3\u0304CD = 15\n[dB], RA,s = 1 [bps] and CL = 2 [bps]. The U-shape of the curves for the proposed strategies can be explained\nby resorting to similar arguments as for Fig. 4 (see Sec. VI). Following this remark, we note from Fig. 7 that the\ngain in terms of outage probability of all strategies with respect to the case CL = 0 is most relevant in the regime\nof weak/strong interference from BS C (i. e. low/high \u03b3CB ). In fact, it is in this regime that the interference from\n\nOctober 9, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f16\n\nR\n\n=2 [bps], C =2 [bps]\n\nA,s\n\nL\n\n1\n0.9\n\nSuperposition\nSimple quantization\nWyner\u2212Ziv\n\nP =0\nC\n\nProbability of outage\n\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\nCL \u2265 RC\n\n0.5\n0.4\n\nCL=\u221e, RC=\u221e\n0.3\n0.2\n\nFig. 7.\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\u03b3CB[dB]\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nSecrecy outage probability vs. the SNR \u03b3CB . The average values of the fading links are \u03b3\u0304AB = \u03b3\u0304AE = \u03b3\u0304CE = \u03b3\u0304CD = 15 [dB].\n\nThe constant value \u03b3CB is 15 [dB]. The line PC = 0 refers to the case when no cooperative interference from C takes place. The target\nsecrecy rate is RA,s = 2 [bps]. The backhaul has CL = 2 [bps], except for the reference line with CL = \u221e.\n\nBS C to B (due to the realizations where RC > CL ) has the least impact on the performance of the link A \u2212 B.\n2) Scheduling performance: Turning to the average rates that can be achieved in the scenario of full channel\nstate information, Fig. 8 considered the downlink rates in terms of the ratios\n\nR\u0304C (M axSecsup )\nR\u0304C (M axRC )\n\nand\n\nR\u0304C (M axSecW Z )\nR\u0304C (M axRC )\n\nfor \u03b3\u0304AB = \u03b3\u0304AE = \u03b3\u0304CD = \u03b3\u0304CE = 15, \u03b3CB = 5 [dB]. These ratio demonstrate which fraction of the maximal\naverage downlink throughput is achieved if the scheduler at C aims to maximize the secrecy of the transmission\nA \u2212 B. Equivalently, the complement to one of such ratios measure the fractional rate loss due to the requirement of\nmaximizing the secrecy of the transmission A \u2212 B. The results show that at high CL , maximum secrecy is coherent\nwith maximal rate RC . However, from Fig. 8 it is seen that for lower CL maximal security is not always achieved\nby maximizing RC , which is in accordance with the observations from Fig. 5. Regarding the SUP strategy, there is\none degenerative effect, which can be explained by observing the SUP curve on Fig. 5. It can be seen (on the figure\nnot discernible for CL = 2) that for large RC , the secrecy rate of the SUP scheme slowly decreases towards the\nasymptotic value (achieved for RC \u2192 \u221e), while for the quantization schemes there are finite values of RC after\nwhich the secrecy rate becomes constant. Hence, the scheduler that maximizes the secrecy tends to select lower\nrates RC when SUP is applied. Nevertheless, when CL = 0, both SUP and WZ operate in identical way.\nThe average secrecy rates from A to B are then shown in Fig. 9-10 in terms of the ratios\nR\u0304A,s (M axSecW Z )\n.\nR\u0304A,s (M axRC )\n\nR\u0304As (M axSecsup )\nR\u0304A,s (M axRC )\n\nand\n\nThus, the figures shows, for each transmission method (WZ or SUP), how much the secrecy\n\nrate is improved if the scheduler at C determines the downlink user (and the corresponding rate RC ) in order\nto maximize the instantaneous rate RA,s rather than the downlink rate RC . It can be seen that for a weak link\nC \u2212 B (low \u03b3CB ), as on Fig. 9 (where \u03b3CB = 5 [dB]), the gain in the secrecy rate for the M axSec schedulers\nis insignificant, which means that application of opportunistic scheduler M axRC at C will be also good for the\nsecurity of the link A \u2212 B. Conversely, for a strong link C \u2212 B, the results on Fig. 9-10 show that the secrecy of the\n\nOctober 9, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f17\n\n1\n\nRatio for average RC\n\n0.95\n\n0.9\n\n0.85\n\n0.8\nMaxSecsup\n0.75\n\n0.7\n\nFig. 8.\n\nRatios\n\nR\u0304C (M axSecSU P )\nR\u0304C (M axRC )\n\nand\n\nMaxSecWZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nR\u0304C (M axSecW Z )\n.\nR\u0304C (M axRC )\n\n3\n\n4\nCL [bps]\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nThe parameters are \u03b3\u0304AB = \u03b3\u0304AE = \u03b3\u0304CD = \u03b3\u0304CE = 15 [dB].

C ONCLUSIONS\nOptimized scheduling and multi-cell BS cooperation are becoming increasingly standard features of current and\nfuture wireless infrastructure (cellular) networks. This work has advanced the notion that such technologies can\nplay an important role in ensuring confidentiality (security) of wireless transmissions. From the analysis of several\ntransmission strategies under different assumptions regarding propagation channels and corresponding channel state\ninformation, a number of conclusions have been drawn. In particular, a technique based on Wyner-Ziv compression\nOctober 9, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f18\n\n5.5\n5\nMaxSecSUP\n\nRatio of average R\n\nA,s\n\n4.5\n\nMaxSecWZ\n\n4\n3.5\n3\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n\nFig. 10.\n\nRatios\n\nR\u0304C (M axSecsup )\nR\u0304C (M axRC )\n\nand\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nR\u0304C (M axSecW Z )\n.\nR\u0304C (M axRC )\n\n4\nCL [bps]\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nThe parameters are \u03b3\u0304AB = \u03b3\u0304AE = \u03b3\u0304CD = \u03b3\u0304CE = 15 [dB]. The constant SNR\n\nis \u03b3CB = 20 [dB].\n\nover the backbone link connecting the BSs has proved to be the most promising, with the added benefit of requiring\nno modifications on the uplink/ downlink transmissions of a conventional cellular systems. When complexity of\nWyner-Ziv encoding is an issue, one could resort to simpler quantization schemes with a performance loss that\ndepends on the network topology. Or else, if willing to modify the downlink transmission/ reception strategy for\nthe sake of ensuring uplink confidentiality, one could opt for channel coding (rather than source coding) based\ntechniques which perform close (or even better than) Wyner-Ziv under some circumstances.\nThere are several interesting extensions of this work. In this paper we have shown some achievable rates, but it is\nimportant to know what is the true secrecy capacity of the introduced method or at least to derive some tight upper\nbounds. Furthermore, the considered scenario can be extended to multiple cooperating base stations, which raises the\nquestion how to organize the transmission/receive schedule for the access points in order to maximize the secrecy\neffect, while not degrading the throughput. Finally, the study can be extended to consider colluding eavesdroppers,\nwhich attempt to jointly decode the desired signal and the interference from the downlink transmissions.\nA PPENDIX I\nA PPENDIX -A: P ROOF OF P ROPOSITION 3\nThe equivalent signal seen at BS B over both the wireless and wired channels in a given time instant i can be\nwritten as a vector MAC channel:\n\uf8ee\n\u1ef8B,i = \uf8f0\n\nYB,i\nX\u0302C,i\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8fb=\uf8f0\n\nhAB\n\nhCB\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\uf8f9\uf8ee\n\uf8fb\uf8f0\n\nXA,i\nXC,i\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8fb+\uf8f0\n\nNi\nQi\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb.\n\n(41)\n\nEQ\nLet SAB\n(RC ) denote the maximum achievable rates from A to B for a given transmission rate RC when the\nEQ\nquantization strategy is used (recall (7)).
