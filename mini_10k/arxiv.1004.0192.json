In particular, leptoquarks are predicted, with couplings to the heavy\nsinglet neutrinos, the scalar partners of which may be components of dark matter.\nThe Majorana neutrino mass matrix itself may have two zero subdeterminants.\n\n\fIntroduction :\n\nThe transition from the Standard Model (SM) of particle interactions to\n\nthe Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is fraught with two well-known\nshortcomings. (1) Whereas baryon number B and lepton number L are automatically conserved in the SM, they are conserved in the MSSM only by the imposition of R parity, i.e.\nR \u2261 (\u22121)2j+3B+L . (2) There exists the term \u03bc\u03c61 \u03c62 in the MSSM superpotential, where \u03c61,2\nare the two Higgs superfields which spontaneously break the electroweak gauge symmetry.\nSince this term is allowed by the gauge symmetry and the supersymmetry, there is no understanding of why \u03bc should be of order the electroweak breaking scale, rather than some\nvery large unification scale.\nIt is clearly desirable and useful to have a single mechanism which solves both problems.\nOne such utilitarian proposal was made eight years ago [1], using a new U(1)X gauge symmetry. Let the quark and doublet superfields transform as n1 and n4 respectively under\nU(1)X . Requiring the absence of anomalies, two classes of solutions for the other superfield\nassignments are then obtained as functions of n1 and n4 . In this paper, the particularly simple choice of n1 = 0 in Solution (A) is discussed, together with some of its phenomenology,\nrelevant to the operating Large Hadron Collider (LHC).\nModel : Consider the gauge group SU(3)C \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y \u00d7 U(1)X with the particle\ncontent of Ref. [1]. For n1 = 0 in Solution (A), the various superfields transform as shown in\nTable 1. There are three copies of Q, uc , dc , L, ec , N c , S1 , S2 ; two copies of U, U c , S3 ; and one\ncopy of \u03c61 , \u03c62 , D, D c. The only allowed terms of the superpotential are thus trilinear, i.e.\nQuc \u03c62 ,\n\nQdc \u03c61 ,\n\nS3 UU c ,\n\nS3 DD c ,\n\nLec \u03c61 ,\nuc N c U,\n\nLN c \u03c62 ,\nuc ec D,\n\nS3 \u03c6 1 \u03c6 2 ,\ndc N c D,\n\nN c N c S1 ,\nQLD c ,\n\n(1)\nS1 S2 S3 .\n\n(2)\n\nThe absence of any bilinear term means that all masses come from soft supersymmetry\nbreaking, thus explaining why the U(1)X and electroweak symmetry breaking scales are\nnot far from that of supersymmetry breaking. As S1,2,3 acquire nonzero vacuum expectation\n2\n\n\fTable 1: Particle content of proposed model.\nSuperfield SU(3)C\nQ = (u, d)\n3\nc\nu\n3\u2217\ndc\n3\u2217\nL = (\u03bd, e)\n1\nc\ne\n1\nc\nN\n1\n\u03c61\n1\n\u03c62\n1\nS1\n1\nS2\n1\nS3\n1\nU\n3\nD\n3\nUc\n3\u2217\nDc\n3\u2217\n\nSU(2)L\n2\n1\n1\n2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\nU(1)Y\n1/6\n\u22122/3\n1/3\n\u22121/2\n1\n0\n\u22121/2\n1/2\n0\n0\n0\n2/3\n\u22121/3\n\u22122/3\n1/3\n\nU(1)X\n0\n3/2\n3/2\n1\n1/2\n1/2\n\u22123/2\n\u22123/2\n\u22121\n\u22122\n3\n\u22122\n\u22122\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\nvalues (VEVs), the exotic (U, U c ) and (D, D c ) fermions obtain Dirac masses from hS3 i, which\nalso generates the \u03bc term. The singlet N c fermion gets a large Majorana mass from hS1 i, so\nthat the neutrino \u03bd gets a small seesaw mass in the usual way. The singlet S1,2,3 fermions\nthemselves get Majorana masses from their scalar counterparts hS1,2,3 i through the S1 S2 S3\nterms. The only massless fields left are the usual quarks and leptons. They then become\nmassive as \u03c601,2 acquire VEVs, as in the MSSM.\nBecause of U(1)X , the structure of the superpotential conserves both B and (\u22121)L , with\nB = 1/3 for Q, U, D, and B = \u22121/3 for uc , dc , U c , D c ; (\u22121)L odd for L, ec , N c , U, U c , D, D c ,\nand even for all others. Hence the exotic U, U c , D, D c scalars are leptoquarks and decay into\nordinary quarks and leptons. The R parity of the MSSM is defined here in the same way,\ni.e. R \u2261 (\u2212)2j+3B+L , and is conserved. Note also that the quadrilinear terms QQQL and\n3\n\n\fuc uc dc ec (allowed in the MSSM) as well as uc dc dc N c are forbidden by U(1)X . Proton decay\nis thus strongly suppressed. It may proceed through the quintilinear term QQQLS1 as the\nS1 fields acquire VEVs, but this is a dimension-six term in the effective Lagrangian, which\nis suppressed by two powers of a very large mass, say the Planck mass, and may safely be\nallowed.\nGauge sector : The new ZX gauge boson of this model becomes massive through hS1,2,3 i =\nu1,2,3 , whereas h\u03c601,2 i = v1,2 contribute to both Z and ZX . The resulting 2 \u00d7 2 mass-squared\nmatrix is given by [2]\nM2Z,ZX =\n\n(1/2)gZ2 (v12 + v22 )\n(3/2)gZ gX (v22 \u2212 v12 )\n.\n2\n[u21 + 4u22 + 9u23 + (9/4)(v12 + v22 )]\n(3/2)gZ gX (v22 \u2212 v12 ) 2gX\n!\n\n(3)\n\nSince precision electroweak measurements require Z \u2212ZX mixing to be very small [3], v1 = v2 ,\ni.e. tan \u03b2 = 1, is assumed from now on.\nConsider the decay of ZX to the usual quarks and leptons. Each fermionic partial width\nis given by\ng 2 MZX 2\n[cL + c2R ],\n\u0393(ZX \u2192 f \u0304f ) = X\n24\u03c0\n\n(4)\n\nwhere cL,R can be read off under U(1)X from Table 1.

The above upper bound may easily exceed that of the\n2\nMSSM. For example, let f = 3gX = g2 , then (mh )max = 2MW\n+ \u01eb = 143 GeV, assuming\n\nm\u0303 = 1 TeV in Eq. (12). Contrast this with the upper bound in the MSSM, i.e. MZ2 cos2 2\u03b2 +\n\u01eb < (126 GeV)2 . If the experimental bound of mh > 114.4 GeV is used, then | cos 2\u03b2| > 0.81\nis required. Here the prediction is that cos 2\u03b2 = 0 and yet mh may be substantially greater\nthan 114.4 GeV. This difference will have important implications for the Higgs search at the\nLHC. Another important difference is the mass of the charged Higgs boson:\n2\n\u2212 f v2,\nm2H \u00b1 = m2A + MW\n\n(13)\n\nwhere mA is the mass of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson, i.e. Im(\u03c601 \u2212 \u03c602 ). For example, if\n2\n2\n, instead of +MW\nin the MSSM.\nf = g2 , then m2H \u00b1 \u2212 m2A = \u2212MW\n\n5\n\n\fNeutrino masses :\n\nThere are three copies each of the superfields L, ec , N c , and S1 . As\n\nsuch, a family symmetry in the lepton sector may be supported. For example, the discrete\nsymmetry Z4 may be used to realize the interesting proposal of Ref. [15] that the observed\nneutrino mass matrix has two zero subdeterminants. Under Z4 , the three copies of L, ec , N c ,\nand S1 separately all transform as 1, i, \u2212i, with \u03c61,2 transforming as 1. From the Lec \u03c61 and\nLN c \u03c62 couplings, the charged-lepton and Dirac neutrino mass matrices are thus diagonal,\nwhereas the N c N c S1 couplings result in the Majorana mass matrix of the form [16, 17]\n\uf8eb\n\nA\n\uf8ec\nMN = \uf8ec\n\uf8edB\nC\n\nB\n0\nD\n\n\uf8f6\n\nC\n\uf8f7\nD\uf8f7\n\uf8f8.\n0\n\n(14)\n\nThe resulting seesaw neutrino mass matrix is then given by [15, 18]\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\uf8ec\n\u22121 2\nM\u03bd = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\u03b2 \u03b1 \u03b2\n\u03b3\n\u03b4\n\n\u03b3\n\u03b4\n\u22121 2\n\n\u03b1 \u03b3\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f8\n\n(15)\n\nwhere the subdeterminants of the (1, 2) and (1, 3) blocks are clearly zero. Assuming \u03b3 = \u03b2,\nthen \u03b823 = \u03c0/4, \u03b813 = 0, and\n\u2206m221 cos 2\u03b812 = |\u03b1\u22121\u03b2 2 + \u03b4|2 \u2212 |\u03b1|2 ,\n\u221a\n\u2206m221 sin 2\u03b812 = 2 2|\u03b1\u2217 \u03b2 + \u03b2 \u2217 (\u03b1\u22121 \u03b2 2 + \u03b4)|,\n1\n1\n\u2206m232 = |\u03b1\u22121\u03b2 2 \u2212 \u03b4|2 \u2212 |\u03b1|2 \u2212 |\u03b1\u22121\u03b2 2 + \u03b4|2 \u2212 2|\u03b2|2.\n2\n2\n\n(16)\n(17)\n(18)\n\nSince there can only be one nontrivial phase in the above, let \u03b1 be real, \u01eb = \u03b1\u22121 \u03b2 2 + \u03b4\nreal, and \u03b2 complex. In the case \u03b2 is also real, it has already been shown [15] that the\nresulting solution has the normal hierarchy of neutrino masses, i.e. m1 < m2 < m3 , such\nthat the effective neutrino Majorana mass measured in neutrinoless double beta decay, i.e.\nthe parameter \u03b1, is about 6 \u00d7 10\u22124 eV, much below the sensitivity of such experiments.\nConsider now the case of a purely imaginary \u03b2, using \u03b2 = i\u03b6, where \u03b6 is real, then a\nsolution exists where \u03b1 is several times larger, as shown below.

(16) to (18),\n\u2206m221 cos 2\u03b812 = (\u01eb \u2212 \u03b1)(\u01eb + \u03b1),\n6\n\n(19)\n\n\f\u221a\n\u2206m221 sin 2\u03b812 = 2 2\u03b6(\u01eb \u2212 \u03b1),\n\n1\n\u2206m232 = \u03b6 2 (4\u03b1\u22122 \u03b6 2 + 4\u03b1\u22121 \u01eb \u2212 2) + (\u01eb2 \u2212 \u03b12 ).\n2\n\n(20)\n(21)\n\nLet \u03b1 = 0.0042 eV, \u01eb = 0.0067 eV, and \u03b6 = 0.0098 eV, then \u2206m221 = 7.45 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 ,\ntan2 \u03b812 = 0.464, and \u2206m232 = 2.53 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 , in good agreement with data [19].\nHeavy neutrino singlet at the LHC : In the canonical seesaw, even if the the heavy neutrino\nsinglet anchor has a mass of order TeV, it is very hard to produce at the LHC [20], because\nit couples only to leptons and the strength of that coupling is necessarily very weak, as\nrequired by the tiny neutrino mass [21]. Here, since N c also couples to the leptoquarks\n(U, U c ) and (D, D c ), it can be produced at the LHC as the decay product of the latter,\nwhich are copiously produced themselves because they have strong interactions.\nSince the scalar \u00d1 c has odd R parity, it may also be a component of dark matter. In\nthat case, the decays of the heavy leptoquark fermions (U, U c ) and (D, D c) to quark jets and\n\u00d1 c may lead to sizable missing-energy signals at the LHC, as recently discussed [22].\nConclusion : The utilitarian supersymmetric U(1)X gauge extension of the Standard Model\nof particle interactions proposed eight years ago [1] allows for two classes of anomaly-free\nmodels which have no \u03bc term and conserve baryon number and lepton number automatically.\nA simple version with leptoquark superfields is discussed here with a number of interesting\nand verifiable properties.\nThe new ZX gauge boson of this model has specified couplings to quarks and leptons\nwhich are distinct from other gauge extensions and may be tested at the LHC. The effective\ntwo-Higgs-doublet sector has tan \u03b2 = 1, and yet the mass of the lightest neutral Higgs boson\nmay exceed the upper limit of 126 GeV predicted in the MSSM. A discrete Z4 symmetry may\nbe accommodated in the lepton sector so that the 3 \u00d7 3 neutrino mass matrix has two zero\nsubdeterminants. The scalar partners of the heavy singlet neutrinos could be components\n\n7\n\n\fof dark matter, and since they may be decay products of the leptoquark fermions, they are\npossible sources of missing energy at the LHC.\nAcknowledgement : This work was supported in part by the U.
