This clearly demonstrates\nthat interactions can have qualitative effect on topological classifications of gapped states of matter\nin more than one dimension.\n\nIntroduction: Topological phases are fully quantum\nmechanical states of matter which are not characterized\nby classical symmetry breaking[1]. While gapped in the\nbulk, quite often, they are accompanied by gapless excitations at their boundary, signaling highly entangled\nnature of their ground state. Since the discovery of the\ninteger quantum Hall effect (IQHE) [2], the list of topological phases in nature has been expanded, in particular,\nby the recent discovery of topological insulators in two\nand three dimensions (2D and 3D) in systems with strong\nspin-orbit coupling [3\u201312], and the identification of 3 He\nB as a topological SC (superfluid) [13]. Unlike the IQHE,\nthe topological character of these topological insulators\nand SCs (i.e., the stable gapless edge or surface modes)\nis protected by time-reversal symmetry (TRS). The presence or absence of a topological distinction among gapped\nphases for a given set of symmetries and for given spatial\ndimensions can be studied systematically, and is summarized in the \"periodic table\" of topological insulators and\nSCs for non-interacting [14] fermions [15\u201317].\nSince interactions are ubiquitous in real materials,\na natural question is whether and how interactions\ncould modify topological classifications obtained for noninteracting systems[18]. In other words, are there cases\nwhere interactions qualitatively affect topological classifications? Even though this question has not been fully\nor thoroughly answered, an exciting progress has been\nmade in Ref. [19], in which Fidkowski and Kitaev explicitly showed that the putative Z classification of onedimensional (1D) \"non-interacting\" SCs with unusual\ntime reversal symmetry (\"BDI class\") is modified to Z8\nwhen interactions are included. This Z8 classification of\nthe 1D BDI SCs with interactions is further illustrated\nfrom the study of entanglement spectrum [20, 21]. In\nmore than one dimension, stability of topological classifications in a number of classes of non-interacting topological insulators and SCs is argued from the perspective\nof low-energy topological response theory [12, 22, 23].\nFor bosonic (or spin) systems, a systematic approach of\nconstructing symmetry protected topological phases in\ngeneral spatial dimensions was recently proposed [24].\nHowever, how interactions in fermionic systems in 2D\n\nand 3D can dramatically modify their topological classification obtained from non-interacting fermions remains\nlargely unexplored [25].\nIn this paper, we partly fill this gap by considering\n2D SCs with TRS (T 2 = \u22121) and reflection symmetry\n(RS) (R2 = \u22121). Note that T is anti-unitary while R\nis unitary. We call SCs with these symmetry properties \"DIII+R\" SCs. First, we show that the topological\nclasses of these DIII+R SCs are classified by an integervalued (Z) topological invariant at the quadratic level.\nSuch topologically non-trivial SCs are characterized by\nhelical Majorana modes on the system's edge. The number of helical Majorana edge states is protected by the\nsymmetries at the non-interacting level.\nWe then ask whether those helical gapless Majorana\nedge modes are stable against interactions while preserving those relevant symmetries in question. As we show\nlater in detail, the helical Majorana edge states in the\ncase of Z = 8 topological invariant are unstable against\n(even weak) interactions \u2013 the gapless helical Majorana\nedge states become gapped while no symmetry is broken in the bulk or the edges of the system. It is worth\nto stress that all the relevant symmetries are fully preserved while the gap opens in the edge. In other words,\nthe edge of the putative Z = 8 system is qualitatively\nthe same as Z = 0 systems when symmetry-preserving\ninteractions are included. Because the system's edge we\nconsider respects the same set of symmetries as its bulk,\nrobust edge states could fully encode topological properties of the bulk due to the bulk-edge correspondence.\nConsequently, the putative Z topological classification of\nnon-interacting \"DIII+R\" superconductors in 2D is reduced Z8 when interactions are considered. A similar\nmodel, but with different set of symmetries, was studied\nindependently in Refs. [26, 27].\nDIII+R SCs: Two-dimensional SCs with TRS T 2 =\n\u22121 (symmetry class DIII) have a Z2 topological invariant\nas shown in the \"periodic table\". To see this explicitly, it\nis helpful to study their edge theory. For a Z2 non-trivial\nDIII SCs in 2D, its generic edge theory is the 1D helical\n\n\f2\nMajorana fermions:\nZ\nHfree = dx [\u03c8\u2191 i\u2202x \u03c8\u2191 \u2212 \u03c8\u2193 i\u2202x \u03c8\u2193 ] ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c8\u03c3 are left/right-moving edge Majorana fermion\noperators and \u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193 are spin index with the following properties under time reversal transformation:\nT \u22121 \u03c8\u2191 T = \u03c8\u2193 and T \u22121 \u03c8\u2193 T = \u2212\u03c8\u2191 , which satisfies T 2 =\n\u22121. It is clear that the helical edge states above respect\nthe TRS. Moreover, this TRS protects this putative gapless helical edge state since there is only one mass term\nim\u03c8\u2191 \u03c8\u2193 which breaks the TRS in the edge. However,\nwhen there are two such helical gapless modes labeled by\na = 1, 2, the putative gapless modes can be fully gapped\nby time reversal invariant terms im(\u03c8\u21911 \u03c8\u21932 + \u03c8\u21931 \u03c8\u21912 ). Consequently, the topological classification is Z2 .\nTo possibly have a Z topological classification of DIII\nSCs in 2D, further discrete symmetry is needed. Since the\nhelical edge states preserve not only TRS but also the RS\nR defined as R\u22121 \u03c8\u2191 (x)R = \u03c8\u2193 (\u2212x) and R\u22121 \u03c8\u2193 (x)R =\n\u2212\u03c8\u2191 (\u2212x) [28], we consider 2D DIII SCs with RS, dubbed\nas the DIII+R class. Note that R2 = \u22121 as required\nfor spin half-integer fermions. Now, we show that the\nDIII+R SCs in 2D are distinguished by an integer-valued\n(Z) topological invariant. To see this, we consider N\ncopies (or flavors) of the helical gapless Majorana edge\n\u0002\n\u0003\nPN R\nstates given by a=1 dx va i\u03c8\u2191a \u2202x \u03c8\u2191a \u2212i\u03c8\u2193a \u2202x \u03c8\u2193a , where\na = 1, . . . , N are the \"flavor\" indices (which is preserved\nby both the time-reversal or reflection transformations)\nand va are the Fermi velocities. We then write down the\nmost general mass term\ni\u03c8\u2191a Mab \u03c8\u2193b ,\n\n\u2217\nMab\n= Mab ,\n\n(2)\n\nand check if it can preserve both TRS and RS. (Note\nthat terms proportional to i\u03c8\u03c3a \u03c8\u03c3b for \u03c3 =\u2191 or \u2193 are irrelevant and only renormalize the Fermi velocities of edge\nFermions.) Time-reversal symmetry requires Mab = Mba\nwhile RS requires Mab = \u2212Mba . Consequently, M = 0\nidentically. In other words, it is impossible to gap the N\npairs of helical gapless Majorana edge states by considering the non-interacting fermion-bilinear terms for arbitrary N . This class of SCs is then characterized by an\ninteger-valued (Z) topological invariant (see below).\nMicroscopic models: Armed with insights from the\nedge theories, we now introduce an explicit mean-field SC\nHamiltonian which respects both TRS and RS and which\nhas non-trivial gapless helical Majorana edge states:\nX \u2020\nX\u0002\n\u0003\nci\u03c3 ci\u03c3\n\u2212 tc\u2020i\u03c3 cj\u03c3 + H.c. \u2212 \u03bc\nHlatt. =\ni\u03c3\n\nhiji\u03c3\n\n+\n\nX\u0002\ni\n\n+\n\nX\u0002\ni\n\n\u2206(c\u2020i\u2191 c\u2020i+x\u0302\u2191\n\n+\n\nc\u2020i\u2193 c\u2020i+x\u0302\u2193 )\n\n+ H.c.\n\n\u0003\n\n\u0003\ni\u2206(c\u2020i\u2191 c\u2020i+\u0177\u2191 \u2212 c\u2020i\u2193 c\u2020i+\u0177\u2193 ) + H.c. ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere c\u2020i\u03c3 are the fermion creation operators on site i\nand \u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193 are spin indices. It is clear that the model\n\nabove is invariant under RS R: cx,y,\u03c3 \u2192 (i\u03c3 x )\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 c\u2212x,y,\u03c3\u2032\nand TRS T : ci\u03c3 \u2192 (i\u03c3 y )\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 ci\u03c3\u2032 [28]. This model describes a SC with spin up px + ipy pairing and spin down\n\u2212px + ipy pairing, and can describe a thin film of 3 He-B.\nOn a cylinder with edges parallel to the x-direction, we\n(numerically) obtain the helical Majorana edge states,\nfor t = \u2206 = 1 and for \u22124 < \u03bc < 0 or 0 < \u03bc < +4,\nsay. These helical edge states are effectively described by\nthe Hamiltonian (1). The N -flavor generalization of this\nmodel is straightforward.\nBulk topological invariant: There is a bulk topological invariant which guarantees, when non-interacting\nand when there is a translation symmetry, the stability\nof the edge modes of DIII+R topological SCs for arbitrary N . The construction is similar in spirit to the mirror Chern-number in 3D topological insulators protected\nby RS [29]. With the periodic boundary condition, the\nquadratic bulk Hamiltonian can be Fourier transformed\nas\nX X \u2020\n\u03a8kx (ky )Hkx (ky )\u03a8kx (ky ),\nH=\n0\u2264kx \u2264\u03c0 ky\n\n\u03a8\u2020kx (ky )\n\n:=\n\n\u0001\nc\u2020\u2191,k , c\u2020\u2193,k , c\u2191,\u2212k , c\u2193,\u2212k .\n\n(4)\n\nWe then note at the reflection symmetric points kx =\nk\u0303x (= 0 and \u03c0), the Bloch Hamiltonian Hk\u0303x (ky ) commutes with R, namely [Hk\u0303x (ky ), J x ] = 0, where J x =\ndiag(i\u03c3 x , \u2212i\u03c3 x ). In other words, at k\u0303x , the quadratic\nHamiltonian conserves S x . Combined with TRS, the\nquadratic Hamiltonian at kx = k\u0303x can be written as\n\u0013\n\u0012\nX \u2020\nc+,k\n,\n(5)\n(c+,k , c\u2212,\u2212k )H\u0304k\u0303x (ky )\nH(k\u0303x ) =\nc\u2020\u2212,\u2212k\nky\n\nwhere the subscripts \u00b1 are eigenvalues of \u03c3 x . Now, the\nHamiltonian H\u0304k\u0303x (ky ) above is in the AIII class with chiral symmetry [15].\nFollowing Ref. 15, gapped 1D quadratic Hamiltonians\nin symmetry class AIII are distinguished by an integer\ntopological invariant, the winding number \u03bd. Thus, at\neach reflection symmetric momentum kx = k\u0303x (k\u0303x = 0\nand \u03c0), we can introduce an integer topological invariant\n(\"the reflection winding number\"), \u03bd(k\u0303x ), the winding\nnumber of H\u0304k\u0303x (ky ). We thus have two integral topological invariants, \u03bd\u0303(kx = 0, \u03c0). The non-zero value of the\ninvariant, \u03bd\u0303(k\u0303x ) 6= 0, guarantees the presence of |\u03bd\u0303(kx )|\npairs of zero-energy Majorana states at k\u0303x , when an edge\nis introduced along x-direction. In particular, when the\ninvariant is non-zero \u03bd\u0303(k\u0303x ) 6= 0 at one of the reflection\nsymmetric momenta (k\u0303x = 0, say) and it is zero at the\nother (k\u0303x = \u03c0), this means there must be |\u03bd\u0303(kx )| branches\nof non-chiral edge modes. In general, the difference of the\nreflection winding number\n\u03bd\u0303(kx = 0) \u2212 \u03bd\u0303(kx = \u03c0)\ntells us the number of non-chiral edge modes.\n\n(6)\n\n\f3\nInteraction effect: At the non-interacting level (and\nwithout disorder), the DIII+R SCs have Z topological\nclassification as shown from both bulk and edge theories.\nNow, we consider the effect of symmetry-preserving interactions in the mean-field BdG Hamiltonian and check\nif the putative topological classification of Z is modified\nor not. Since gapless helical edge states are the hallmark\nof those topologically nontrivial SCs, we believe that it\nwould be sufficient to check if the gapless helical edge\nstates are stable against interactions while requiring there\nis no symmetry breaking induced by interactions [30].\nFor the case of topological invariant N = 8 [more generally N \u2261 0 (mod 8)], we try to identify certain interactions that can destabilize the gapless edge states\nwhile preserving the symmetries of the bulk and the edge.\nFor simplicity, we consider the helical edge modes of free\nfermions with the same Fermi velocities va = v\nZ\n8\nX\n\u0003\n\u0002 a\n(7)\n\u03c8\u2191 i\u2202x \u03c8\u2191a \u2212 \u03c8\u2193a i\u2202x \u03c8\u2193a ,\nHfree = v dx\na=1\n\nwhich is invariant under the global SO(8) rotations among the left-moving or right-moving Majorana fermions. Now, we consider interactions allowed\nby TRS and RS. One naturally starts with the following SO(8) symmetric interactions HGN = Hfree \u2212\n\u0001\nR\nP8\na a 2\ng dx\na=1 i\u03c8\u2191 \u03c8\u2193 , where g is the coupling constant.\nThis theory is then the SO(8) Gross-Neveu (GN) model\nin (1+1)D, which is exactly solvable [31]. Especially, the\ninteraction is marginally relevant for g > 0: for arbitrary\nsmall interaction strength g the ground state is gapped by\nspontaneously breaking the time reversal (or Z2 chiral)\nsymmetry with the order parameter hi\u03c8\u2191a \u03c8\u2193a i \u223c e\u2212\u03c0/(vg) .\nThere are twofold degenerate ground states at the edge.\nWhen g < 0, the interaction is marginally irrelevant\nand the ground state remains gapless. In other words,\nthe SO(8) symmetric GN interactions cannot result in a\nunique gapped ground state in the edge. We need to look\nfor some other channel of interactions to fulfill this.\nWe follow the construction introduced in Ref. [19].\nThe non-interacting edge is described by the conformal\nfield theory (CFT) of 8 free Majorana fermions, which\nis equivalent to the SO(8)1 Wess-Zumino-Witten model.\nThe 8 fermion operators \u03c8\u03c3a (\u03c3 =\u2191 or \u2193) form the vector\nrepresentation of SO(8). Moreover, the 16-dimensional\nspinor representation of SO(8) is reducible to two 8dimensional irreducible ones formed by spinor operators\n\u03b7\u03c3a and \u03c7a\u03c3 , a = 1, . . . , 8. The explicit forms of \u03b7\u03c3a and \u03c7a\u03c3\nare given by\n\u0015\n\u0014\ni\n(8)\nexp (\u00b1\u03c61\u03c3 \u00b1 \u03c62\u03c3 \u00b1 \u03c63\u03c3 \u00b1 \u03c64\u03c3 )\n2\n\nwhere \u03c6a\u03c3 are boson fields obtained from bosonizing the\na\nsystem, \u03c8\u03c32a\u22121 \u00b1i\u03c8\u03c32a = e\u00b1i\u03c6\u03c3 . The number of minus sign\nin the exponent of Eq. (8) is even for \u03b7 a but odd for \u03c7a .\nAccidently, \u03c8, \u03b7 and \u03c7 all form 8-dimension representations of SO(8); they can actually be transformed into one\n\nanother by the so-called triality symmetry of SO(8). It\nturns out that the spinor fields are useful to construct\nthe interactions we desire.\nTo fully gap the edge states without spontaneously\nbreaking any symmetry, we consider the following interactions\n\" \u0012\n\u00132\nZ\nX7\nHint = \u2212 dx A\ni\u03b7\u2191a \u03b7\u2193a\na=1\n\n+B\n\n\u0012X\n7\n\na=1\n\ni\u03b7\u2191a \u03b7\u2193a\n\n\u0013\n\ni\u03b7\u21918 \u03b7\u21938\n\n\u0015\n\u0001\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\nwhich is SO(7)-invariant and leaves \u03b7\u03c38 fixed. This SO(7)symmetric interaction is also local in terms of the original\nfermions \u03c8\u03c3a . Indeed, a finite gap opens in the edge states\nwhile preserving the symmetries in question, as explicitly\nshown in Ref. [19] when B < 0 and 2A > B. To understand this, let us first look at the limit A \u226b |B| which is\nthe SO(7) GN model plus free \u03b7\u03c38 fermions (when B \u2192 0).\nThe chiral symmetry is broken by the SO(7) GN interacP7\ntions with the order parameter M = hi a=1 i\u03b7\u2191a \u03b7\u2193a i 6= 0,\nwhich generates a mass term iBM \u03b7\u21918 \u03b7\u21938 for \u03b7 8 fermions.\nNow, the \u03b7 8 fermions can be mapped to the transverse\nfield Ising model with field strength (h \u2212 hc ) \u221d \u00b1BM ,\nwhere hc is the critical field strength in the transverse\nfield Ising model which is equal to the Ising interaction\nstrength. For h > hc , its ground state is paramagnetic\nwithout any symmetry breaking; for h < hc , the system spontaneously breaks the Ising symmetry resulting\nin twofold degenerate ground states. In other words,\nB > 0 and B < 0 lie in two different phases. Since\nB = 2A > 0 is the SO(8) GN model which spontaneously break the chiral symmetry having twofold degenerate ground states, it is then clear that B < 0 phase\nhas a unique gapped ground state without breaking any\nsymmetry.\nIt is worthwhile to understand more heuristically why\nN = 8 is special. The edge theory with N = 8 is\nqualitatively equivalent to the two-leg ladder electron\nmodel at half-filling. Since there are two electrons per\nunit cell for the two-leg ladder at half-filling, having a\nfully gapped ground state without breaking any symmetry is possible and expected [32]. To illustrate this,\nlet us consider lattice Majorana fermions on 1d chains\ndescribed by the Hamiltonian [19], H = uH1 + wH2\nwhere H1 is quadratic\nP8 P in lattice real fermion operators:\nab\nH1 = \u2212(i/2) a=1 j sa \u03bbaj \u03bbaj+1 , where {\u03bbai , \u03bbbj } = 2\u03b4ij\nand sa = {1, 1, \u22121, \u22121, 1, 1, \u22121, \u22121}. It is clear that H1\nis invariant under either TRS or RS, when we assume\na+2\nR : \u03bbaj \u2192 (\u22121)a \u03bba+2\n\u2192 \u2212(\u22121)a \u03bba\u2212j ,\n\u2212j , \u03bbj\n\nT :\n\n\u03bbaj\n\n\u2192\n\n\u03bba+2\n,\nj\n\n\u03bba+2\nj\n\n\u2192\n\n\u2212\u03bbaj ,\n\n(10)\n\na = 1, 2, 5, 6. (11)\n\nP\nH2 is an interaction, and given by H2 = j W (\u03bbaj ) where\nW (\u03bbaj ) is a four fermion interaction composed of eight\n\n\f4\nMajorana fermions:\nW (\u03bba ) = +\u03bb1 \u03bb2 \u03bb3 \u03bb4 + \u03bb1 \u03bb2 \u03bb5 \u03bb6 + \u03bb1 \u03bb2 \u03bb7 \u03bb8\n3 4 5 6\n\n3 4 7 8\n\n(12)\n\n5 6 7 8\n\n+\u03bb \u03bb \u03bb \u03bb +\u03bb \u03bb \u03bb \u03bb +\u03bb \u03bb \u03bb \u03bb\n\n\u2212 \u03bb2 \u03bb3 \u03bb6 \u03bb7 \u2212 \u03bb1 \u03bb4 \u03bb5 \u03bb8 + \u03bb1 \u03bb3 \u03bb5 \u03bb7 + \u03bb2 \u03bb4 \u03bb6 \u03bb8\n\u2212 \u03bb2 \u03bb3 \u03bb5 \u03bb8 \u2212 \u03bb1 \u03bb4 \u03bb6 \u03bb7 \u2212 \u03bb1 \u03bb3 \u03bb6 \u03bb8 \u2212 \u03bb2 \u03bb4 \u03bb5 \u03bb7 .\nIn the absence of the interaction term w = 0, the lattice model is gapless, whose continuum limit is given by\nthe Hamiltonian (7). When we switch on w 6= 0, the\nedge theory is gapped with unique ground state without\nbreaking symmetries. This can be understood in the following way: the interaction W can be written in terms\nof complex fermions\n(\u03bb1 + i\u03bb2 )/2 = c1\u2191 ,\n\n(\u03bb3 \u2212 i\u03bb4 )/2 = c1\u2193 ,\n\n(\u2212\u03bb5 + i\u03bb6 )/2 = c2\u2191 ,\n\n(\u03bb7 + i\u03bb8 )/2 = c2\u2193 ,\n\ntopological SC with the topological integer (= N ), have\nbeen studies [35]. It is known that there is an even-odd effect in N : the mean conductance decreases algebraically\nas L\u22121/2 with the length of the wire L for odd N , whereas\nit decays exponentially with L for even N . Correspondingly, for symmetry class DIII with N odd the density\nof states shows the Dyson singularity. This implies that\ndisorder simply reduces the Z topological classification of\nDIII+R SCs to the Z2 classification, which is the same\nas the topological classification of 2D DIII SCs in the\nperiodic table. In a separate paper [33] we will report\nthe other cases where the Z topological classification is\nreduces to the Z2 classification, which is not related to\nthe existing topological class in the periodic table.\nNote added: Recently, some other papers, a couple of\nworks that deal with similar topic have appeared[36\u201338].\n\nW (\u03bbaj ) = 16S j,1 * S j,2 + 2(nj,1 \u2212 1)2 + 2(nj,2 \u2212 1)2 \u2212 2,\n(14)\n\nAcknowledgements: We would like to thank EunAh Kim, Steve Kivelson, Dung-Hai Lee, and Shou-Cheng\nZhang for helpful discussion, and in particular XiaoLiang Qi for sharing his results with us prior to its arXiv\nsubmission.

With this interaction, the\ncharge degrees of freedom will be frozen by Mott physics.\nThe exchange interaction S 1 * S 2 (the \"rung-exchange\"\ninteraction) realizes the rung-single phase which has a\nunique ground state without breaking any symmetry.\nDiscussion: We have discussed interaction effects on\ntopological SCs in 2D protected by TRS and RS. This\nis a non-trivial example in 2D where topological classification of ground states are dramatically altered by the\ninteraction effect. In a separate paper, we plan on a\nmore systematic study on topological insulators and SCs\nprotected by RS in addition to other possible discrete\nsymmetries [33, 34].\nWe close with discussion on disorder effects: In the\nten-fold classification of topological insulators and SCs,\nit has been proved useful to consider the boundary (edge,\nsurface, etc.) Anderson localization problem: For a topological bulk, one should find a boundary mode which\nis completely immune to disorder. In turn, once one\nfinds such \"Anderson delocalization\" at the boundary, it\nmeans there is a topologically non-trivial bulk. Not only\nthis bulk-boundary correspondence can be used to find\nand classify bulk topological phases in the absence of disorder, it immediately tells us such topological phases are\nstable against disorder. For topological phases protected\nby a set of spatial symmetries, stability against disorder is, in general, not trivial, since spatial inhomogeneity\ndoes not respect the spatial symmetries. One can still\nconsider, however, situations where the spatial symmetries are preserved on average.
