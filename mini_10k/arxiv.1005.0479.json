[1] for an overview). Even though it now seems that inflation is the primary source of the\ninhomogeneities which lead to anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the idea has persisted. The\nmain reason for this is that the amplitude of fluctuations produced by strings formed close to a Grand Unified Theory\n(GUT) phase transition (\u223c 1016 GeV) is of the order of observed density inhomogeneities on large scales, making it\nan attractive probe of physics at energies way above that possible in terrestrial accelerators.\nIt may seem very non-minimal to have two mechanisms creating inhomogeneities and contrary to the common-sense\napproach advocated by Occam's Razor. However, there are at least two classes of inflation models, linked to popular\nideas in fundamental physics, where strings can be formed and the two sets of perturbations have similar amplitudes.\nOne is based on Supersymmetric Hybrid Inflation [2\u20136] and the other is Brane Inflation [7]. In both cases cosmic\nstrings can be formed during the phase transition at the end of inflation [8\u201310]. It was shown in ref.[11] that this can\nhappen in a large number of symmetry breaking schemes and it is possible that semi-local strings could form [12, 13]\nin situations where strings are not forced to exist on topological grounds.\nOne cannot rule out strings using observations per se, rather one can only constrain the tension (or the mass\nper unit length) of the strings, and hence the energy scale at which the strings are formed. The tension is usually\nquantified in terms of the dimensionless ratio G\u03bc/c2 . This can be done in many different ways. In this paper we will\nfocus on two: the anisotropies, created by the Kaiser-Stebbins effect [14, 15] and related pre-recombination processes\nin the CMB; and the stochastic background of gravitational waves created by the decay of string loops [16].\nThere are serious difficulties in setting such limits due to the dynamic range involved in modeling the evolution of\na cosmic string network over cosmological scales. This has led to a number of different constraints being published\nin the literature which are often contradictory \u2013 these will be reviewed in the subsequent sections. The objective\nof the present paper is two-fold. For both types of observations we will review the important physics and attempt\nto delineate the key uncertainties. We then present what we believe are the most reliable constraints based on the\npresent knowledge. In the case of the CMB observations we will present two different constraints, based on different\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: rbattye@jb.man.ac.uk\naddress: adammoss@phas.ubc.ca\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: (Left) Comparison of cosmic string power spectra computed with the Unconnected Segment Model (USM) using the\nNambu \u2013 model A \u2013 (solid line) and AH mimic \u2013 model B \u2013 (dotted line) parameters.

(Right) Comparison of scalar,\nvector and tensor modes for the USM AH mimic (solid) parameters and the actual AH spectra from simulations (dotted) [25].\nThe former has G\u03bc/10\u22126 c2 = 1.91, and the latter 2.04. From top-to-bottom at low l the ordering of the curves is the total\npower, then the anisotropy from vectors, scalars and tensors, respectively.\n\nassumptions about the evolution of the string network. We note that the constraints presented here will apply only\ndirectly to strings where the intercommutation probability, p, is unity; that is, they can only be directly applied to\nnormal field theoretic strings and not necessarily to cosmic superstrings [17].\nII.\n\nCMB SPECTRA FROM COSMIC STRINGS\n\nThe key to predicting the observed CMB anisotropies from strings is a detailed understanding of the evolution of a\ncosmic string network. The main idea is that, after formation, the network evolves toward a self-similar scaling regime,\nwhereby the average properties of the network remain approximately constant as a function of time. In the standard\nscenario this is achieved by the production of loops and their subsequent decay into radiation, usually assumed to be\ngravitational.\nThe scaling assumption is not at issue. It has been observed in just about every simulation that has ever been\ndone. However, the precise characteristics of the scaling regime are of critical importance for predicting the CMB\nanisotropy spectrum. The problem is that each simulation technique needs to make assumptions in order to achieve\nsufficient dynamical range. The two most popular approaches are: (A) to solve the Nambu equations of motion for\na string in an expanding universe and include the effects of reconnection by hand; and (B) to solve the equations\nof motion for the Abelian-Higgs (AH) model. In method A one ignores the effects of radiation backreaction, which\nis likely to be important in setting the size of loops which the string network creates, making the observed scaling\ndependent on the removal of sufficiently small loops from the simulation. Radiation into propagating modes of the\nfield is included in method B, but one is necessarily forced to consider simulation box sizes which are only \u223c 300\ntimes greater than the core string width, thereby reducing the dynamical range. This could also lead to the radiation\nbeing stronger in the simulation than in realistic string networks since the typical radius of curvature is large relative\nto the core width. Moreover one has to accept contortions involving fixing, or reducing the rate of growth of, the\ncore width in comoving units in order to perform simulations in an expanding universe. Dynamical range is less of a\nproblem in method A, since the core width is zero and the strings are represented as 1D objects, as opposed to the\n3D box required for field theory simulations, thereby allowing much larger grid sizes. Having said that no simulation\ncan achieve the dynamical range required to model the real Universe!\nSimulations using method A have been used to derive the key statistical parameters of the string network which\nappear to be different in the radiation and matter eras [18\u201321]. It is found that the correlation length L = \u03bedH (t), where\ndH (t) is the particle horizon distance, differs substantially between the radiation and matter eras, with \u03berad = 0.13 and\n\u03bemat = 0.21 (see refs . [22, 23] and references therein), corresponding to a significantly lower string density (\u03c1str = \u03bc/L2\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 2: A montage of plots which show the dependence of the string spectrum on parameters of the USM. In each case the solid\nand dotted lines are the Nambu and AH mimic models respectively from Fig. 1. In all but the top-left plot we have varied the\none parameter keeping all the others the same as in the AH mimic model: (top-left) the dashed line is the USM spectrum with\n\u03be = 0.13, v = 0.65c and \u03b2 = 1.9 but no matter-radiation transition; (top-right) the short dashed line has \u03be = 0.2 and the long\ndashed line has \u03be = 0.5; (bottom-left) the short dashed line has v = 0.0c and the long dashed line has v = 0.8c; (bottom-right)\nthe short dashed line has \u03b2 = 1.5 and the long dashed line \u03b2 = 1.9.\n\nwhere \u03bc is the string tension - whose value is the main subject of the paper) in the matter era. There is substantial\nsmall-scale structure on the long string network. This can be quantified in terms of a renormalized string tension [24],\n\u03bceff = \u03b2\u03bc, and it is found that \u03b2rad = 1.9 and \u03b2mat = 1.5. On the other hand, the RMS velocity of the string segments\n2\n2\nonly varies very slightly between the different eras, with vrad = hvrad\ni1/2 = 0.65c and vmat = hvmat\ni1/2 = 0.60c. It has\nbeen shown that a velocity dependent one-scale model can be used to describe the evolution between the radiation\nand matter eras, and the extrapolation into the cosmological constant dominated era. This typically involves a long\ntransient with the string density only achieving its matter era value around z \u223c 100.\nContrasting results are found using method B [25]. Typically very small loops are created from the fragmentation\nof horizon scale loops and most of the energy loss, required in order to maintain scaling, is achieved by radiation of\nthe massive modes associated with the AH model. \u03be \u2248 0.3 and v \u2248 0.5c [26] are computed from the simulations, with\nlittle difference observed between simulations performed in the radiation and matter eras. The nature of the observed\nsmall-scale structure on the strings is different but is compatible with \u03b2 \u2248 1.\nWe note that Ringeval et al [27] find that \u03berad \u2248 0.16 and \u03bemat \u2248 0.19 using Nambu simulations which corresponds\nto a change in density between the radiation and matter densities of \u2248 1.4 as opposed to \u2248 2.6 which would be the\ncase if \u03berad \u2248 0.13 and \u03bemat \u2248 0.21. This will lead to results more similar to those which come from the AH model.\nIn addition an attempt to compute the spectrum directly from Nambu simulations has recently being made [28].\nIn both cases one can in principal compute the unequal-time correlator (UETC), C\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 = h\u03b8\u03bc\u03bd (\u03c4 )\u03b8\u03bc\u03bd (\u03c4 \u2032 )i, of the\nstring network stress-energy tensor, \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd , from the simulation. Using the stiff source approximation, one can then\ncompute the CMB anisotropies by either decomposing the UETC in eigenmodes [29], or averaging realizations with\n\n\f4\nthe correct statistical properties. An alternative approach is to model the UETC using what has become known at\nthe unconnected segment model (USM). This models the string network as an ensemble of string segments of length\n\u03bedH (t) with an RMS velocity v. This idea [30] was first used in the context of the CMB in refs. [31, 32] and was later\nadapted to include the matter-radiation transition [22] and the effects of small-scale structure on the network via the\n'wiggliness' parameter, \u03b2 [23]. The weakness of this approach is that there is some freedom due to the parameters of\nthe model, \u03be, v and \u03b2, which could be functions of time, but these can be and have been computed from simulations.\nThe present work uses the USM and the code CMBACT [23] which was also used in refs. [33\u201337]. The spectrum\ncomputed using the USM and the parameters from the Nambu simulations (model A) are presented in the left hand\npanel of Fig. 1, along with the spectrum computed from the AH model simulations [25]. It is clear that the two spectra\nare very different, with model A having a fairly sharp peak at around l \u223c 500, whereas the AH spectrum has a lower\nand broader peak, and falls off very sharply at high l. It is not necessary for the string spectrum to be known to the\nlevel of precision of the inflationary component, since it is constrained to be < 10% of the total anisotropy. However,\nthe discrepancy illustrated here is larger than is acceptable and it leads to important quantitative differences when\neach of the spectra are applied to the data.\nThe spectrum computed using the USM is not unique, being a function of the parameters, and in particular the\nfirst CMB spectrum computed using it [31] looks very similar to that computed from the Abelian-Higgs simulations.\nThis first spectrum just used a single, constant value for \u03be and v, and ignored the effects of the matter-radiation\ntransition and small-scale structure, that is, it had \u03b2 = 1. It seems plausible that it might be possible to compute an\nAH 'mimic' model using the USM (model B). In order to investigate this we ran a suite of simulations of the USM\nwith 3 parameters, \u03be, v and \u03b2, all assumed to be constant with time, and then minimized the residuals to the true\nAH spectrum taking into account the decomposition into the scalar, vector and tensor (SVT) modes, all of which are\npresent in cosmic string spectra. We found that \u03be = 0.35, v = 0.4c and \u03b2 = 1.05 gave the best fit. These are quite\nclose to the values computed from the AH model simulations discussed earlier. The spectrum created using model B\nis compared to that from the AH model simulations in the right hand panel of Fig. 1. We see that there is remarkably\ngood agreement between the spectra and that the values of G\u03bc/c2 required to achieve the observed level of fluctuations\nare very similar. This suggests that the discrepancy in the spectra between the USM used to describe the Nambu\nsimulations and that from the AH model simulations is mainly due to the computed correlation properties, and the\ndifferences in the simulation techniques, not the subsequent methods used to infer the CMB spectrum. We have also\ncomputed the CDM power spectrum for both string models, but these are subdominant compared to the inflationary\ncomponent when normalized to the observed large angle CMB amplitude [22, 31]. Since the string contribution is\nlimited to < 10% of the total anisotropy, the CDM power spectrum from strings is completely subdominant.\nIt is worth investigating what are the primary reasons for the differences between the Nambu and AH spectra. In\nFig. 2 we have first removed the matter-radiation transition, making the spectrum just a function of single values of \u03be,\nv and \u03b2. We have then varied each of the three parameters relative to the AH mimic model. It is clear that the most\nsignificant reason for the discrepancy is the effect of the matter-radiation transition, which is present in the Nambu\nsimulations but not observed in the AH simulations. The other important effect comes from the correlation length\n\u03be, whereas the parameters v and \u03b2 appear to have little effect on the overall spectrum. The small-scale structure\nparameter, \u03b2, does play an important role in regulating the relative contribution of the scalar, vector and tensor\ncomponents; values of \u03b2 > 1 have an enhanced scalar component relative to the vector component. The tensor\ncomponent is low in all cases.\nIn the next section, where we describe constraints on G\u03bc/c2 , we will present results for the two spectra (model A\nand B) \u2013 the qualitative conclusions are similar, but there are important quantitative differences, particularly in the\nupper limit on G\u03bc/c2 . It is instructive to try understand why there is such a significant discrepancy in the properties\nderived from the 2 different simulation methods which leads to these differences.\nThe most worrying aspect of the AH simulations is their size relative to the core width. It could be that the absence\nof small-scale structure is related to the artificially strong massive radiation seen in the simulations. It is plausible\nthat this could smooth out the small-scale structure on the long strings and remove the need for loop formation. The\nfact that the string width is kept constant in comoving coordinates, which makes it artificially large relative to the\nhorizon, may be responsible for there being little difference between the scaling behaviours in the radiation and matter\neras. The achilles heel of the Nambu simulations is the absence of radiation which could over-produce small-scale\nstructure. Clearly more work needs to be done to resolve these discrepancies, but it is reassuring that both models\ncan be represented with the necessary level of accuracy using the USM. An alternative to presenting results for the\ntwo separate models would be to allow \u03be, v and \u03b2 to vary within the USM and marginalized over them as nuisance\nparameters.\n\n\f5\n\nParameter\nNS\n2\n\u03a9b h\n0.0231 \u00b1 0.0005\n\u03a9c h2\n0.107 \u00b1 0.003\n\u03b8A\n1.042 \u00b1 0.002\n\u03c4R\n0.087 \u00b1 0.017\nlog(1010 PR )\n3.04 \u00b1 0.04\nns\n0.957 \u00b1 0.013\nG\u03bc/10\u22127 c2\n(f10 )\nh\n0.74 \u00b1 0.02\n\u2212 log L\n+BBN\n\n1440.8\n1442.0\n\nS (NAMBU)\n0.0239 \u00b1 0.0008\n0.107 \u00b1 0.004\n1.043 \u00b1 0.002\n0.088 \u00b1 0.017\n3.01 \u00b1 0.04\n0.958 \u00b1 0.013\n< 2.6\n(< 0.044)\n0.75 \u00b1 0.02\n\nModel\nS (AH)\nHZ NS\nHZ S (NAMBU)\n0.0240 \u00b1 0.0008 0.0243 \u00b1 0.0004 0.0253 \u00b1 0.0007\n0.107 \u00b1 0.004\n0.105 \u00b1 0.003\n0.105 \u00b1 0.003\n1.044 \u00b1 0.003\n1.046 \u00b1 0.002\n1.047 \u00b1 0.002\n0.089 \u00b1 0.017\n0.113 \u00b1 0.018\n0.111 \u00b1 0.018\n3.02 \u00b1 0.04\n3.11 \u00b1 0.04\n3.07 \u00b1 0.04\n0.970 \u00b1 0.016\n1\n1\n< 6.4\n1.9 \u00b1 0.5\n(< 0.093)\n(0.027 \u00b1 0.013)\n0.75 \u00b1 0.02\n0.77 \u00b1 0.01\n0.79 \u00b1 0.02\n\n1440.2\n1442.0\n\n1440.3\n1442.1\n\n1446.7\n1450.4\n\n1445.2\n1450.5\n\nHZ S (AH)\n0.0253 \u00b1 0.0005\n0.105 \u00b1 0.003\n1.047 \u00b1 0.002\n0.101 \u00b1 0.017\n3.04 \u00b1 0.04\n1\n5.3 \u00b1 1.0\n(0.075 \u00b1 0.025)\n0.78 \u00b1 0.02\n1442.2\n1448.4\n\nTABLE I: CMB + SDSS constraints on string models using qstr as the parameter.

Since the temperature power spectrum produced by strings is\nlimited to around \u223c 10% of the total observed power, it is sufficient to keep the shape of the string spectrum fixed in\na Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) analysis, and vary only the normalization G\u03bc/c2 . In this way, one avoids the\ntime-consuming computation of the string spectrum for each set of cosmological parameters. To generate the fixed\nstring spectrum for the Nambu and AH mimic (hereafter we refer to this simply as 'AH') models outlined above, we\nused best-fit parameters from the WMAP 5 year data release [38].\nTo generate the MCMC chains we used COSMOMC [39], which makes use of the CAMB [40] and CMBFAST [41]\ncodes. We vary a total of 7 cosmological parameters: \u2013 the baryon density, \u03a9b h2 ; cold dark matter density, \u03a9c h2 ;\nthe acoustic scale, \u03b8A ; optical depth, \u03c4 ; amplitude and spectral index of primordial fluctuations, PR and nS ; together\nwith the string normalization G\u03bc/c2 . We will include G\u03bc/c2 in two ways. In one set of runs we adopt qstr =\n(G\u03bc/1.1 \u00d7 10\u22126 c2 )2 as the parameter. This was used in ref. [42], and is similar to the method of ref. [43], which used\nf10 , defined as the fraction of total power due to strings at l = 10. An alternative parameterization is log10 (G\u03bc/c2 ),\nwhich was used in ref. [36]. As we will see there are subtle differences in the resulting constraints because the choices\nimpose flat priors on different functions of G\u03bc/c2 . In both approaches we will compute f10 for each sample in the\nMarkov-Chain in order to compare with other analyses of string constraints [43]. Finally, we marginalize over the SZ\namplitude ASZ , assuming the Komatsu and Seljak template [44]. Also, in some instances we will fix nS = 1, that is a\nHarrison-Zel'dovich (HZ) spectrum, to compare the goodness-of-fit to a model where nS is allowed to vary.\nWe use CMB data from the WMAP 5 year release [45, 46] and the ACBAR [47], BOOMERANG [48], CBI [42] and\nQUAD [49] experiments, which observe to higher l. The latter high resolution data are important to help break the\ndegeneracy which exists between nS and G\u03bc/c2 for WMAP alone. Following ref. [42], we also include the BIMA [50]\ndata point at leff \u2248 5000 to constrain the SZ amplitude, without assuming a prior upper limit on ASZ as done in the\nanalysis of the WMAP 5 year data [46]. However, imposing this upper limit on ASZ does not significantly effect our\nconclusions. We also use matter power spectrum data from the SDSS Luminous Red Galaxies sample [51], and Big\n\n\f6\n\n0.5\n0.4\n\nq\n\nstr\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n0.94\n\n0.96\n\n0.98\nns\n\n1\n\n0.92\n\n0.94\n\n0.96\nns\n\n0.98\n\nFIG. 3: 2D likelihoods of scalar spectral index nS versus cosmic string amplitude parameter qstr for the Nambu (red, likelihood\nsurface at front) and AH (blue, surface behind) string spectra. In the left panel we show constraints from CMB+SDSS data,\nand on the right constraints from CMB+SDSS+BBN.\n\nBang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraints on the baryon fraction from measurements of deuterium at high redshift [52].\nThe latter gives \u03a9b h2 = (2.13 \u00b1 0.10) \u00d7 10\u22122 , which is slightly lower than that suggested from CMB data alone [38].\nB.\n\nUsing qstr as a parameter\n\nThe detailed results of our analyses using CMB+SDSS data and qstr as the parameter describing the amplitude of\nthe string spectrum are given in table I. We include values for \u2212 log L both with and without the BBN prior. We\nwill use the results from CMB+SDSS data as our headline results in this paper, but will also discuss the significant\nimpact of including BBN data.\nFor models where nS is allowed to vary, the improvement in the goodness-of-fit when including strings is not\nsignificant over the non-string model, in both the Nambu and AH cases (\u2206\u03c72 = 1.2 and 1.0 respectively for one extra\nparameter in the case where we do not include the BBN prior). This suggests that there is no need to include the\nstrings in order to explain the data, but constraints can be imposed on the cosmic string tension.\nThe constraints on G\u03bc/c2 and f10 are summarized for different combinations of data and the two string models in\ntable II. It is clear that constraint is improved by the inclusion of the SDSS and BBN data. The 2\u03c3 upper limits\nwhich we will quote from CMB+SDSS data are G\u03bc/c2 < 2.6 \u00d7 10\u22127 for the Nambu model and G\u03bc/c2 < 6.4 \u00d7 10\u22127\nfor the AH model. The upper limit on G\u03bc/c2 (and the respective string fraction f10 ) is around a factor of two and\na half smaller in the Nambu case and there are two reasons for this. The most significant is that the Nambu model\nspectrum has a lower value of G\u03bc/c2 for a given power level on large-scales. In addition the Nambu spectrum has\nmore small scale power relative to the AH case. This means that, if the amplitude of the spectrum is too high, the\nstrings can modify the precise peak structure in the high WMAP signal-to-noise regime of l \u2248 200 \u2212 400, leading to\na tighter constraint.\nThe degeneracy between G\u03bc/c2 and nS is illustrated in the left panel of Fig. 3. In previous work, we found\nthat nS = 1 was completely compatible with CMB data in the presence of a subdominant string contribution [36];\nthis point was also made in ref. [43]. With improved CMB data and the inclusion of the SDSS, we find this is no\nlonger the case, especially for the Nambu model. There is still a degeneracy between G\u03bc and nS in the AH model,\nalthough it is considerably reduced, but the two quantities appear to be completely decoupled in the Nambu case.\nThe marginalized value of nS is around 3\u03c3 from nS = 1, with \u2206\u03c72 = 10.0 between the HZ spectrum and variable\nnS models (for comparison, with no strings, \u2206\u03c72 = 11.9). For the AH case, the marginalized value of nS is around\n2\u03c3 from nS = 1, with \u2206\u03c72 = 3.8. This point has led us to suggest that the F- and D-term supersymmetric hybrid\ninflation models are very tightly constrained and that minimal models are probably ruled out by the data even in the\npresence of strings [53].\n\n\f7\n\nParameter\nNS\n2\n\u03a9b h\n0.0231 \u00b1 0.0005\n\u03a9c h2\n0.107 \u00b1 0.003\n\u03b8A\n1.042 \u00b1 0.002\n\u03c4R\n0.087 \u00b1 0.017\nlog(1010 PR )\n3.04 \u00b1 0.04\nns\n0.957 \u00b1 0.013\nG\u03bc/10\u22127 c2\n(f10 )\nh\n0.74 \u00b1 0.02\n\u2212 log L\n+BBN\n\n1440.8\n1442.0\n\nS (NAMBU)\n0.0234 \u00b1 0.0007\n0.107 \u00b1 0.004\n1.043 \u00b1 0.002\n0.087 \u00b1 0.016\n3.02 \u00b1 0.04\n0.957 \u00b1 0.013\n< 2.3\n(< 0.035)\n0.74 \u00b1 0.02\n1440.2\n1442.1\n\nModel\nS (AH)\nHZ NS\nHZ S (NAMBU)\n0.0234 \u00b1 0.0007 0.0243 \u00b1 0.0004 0.0248 \u00b1 0.0007\n0.107 \u00b1 0.003\n0.105 \u00b1 0.003\n0.105 \u00b1 0.003\n1.043 \u00b1 0.002\n1.046 \u00b1 0.002\n1.046 \u00b1 0.002\n0.088 \u00b1 0.017\n0.113 \u00b1 0.018\n0.112 \u00b1 0.019\n3.03 \u00b1 0.04\n3.11 \u00b1 0.04\n3.09 \u00b1 0.04\n0.960 \u00b1 0.014\n1\n1\n< 5.3\n< 2.5\n(< 0.071)\n(< 0.044)\n0.74 \u00b1 0.02\n0.77 \u00b1 0.01\n0.79 \u00b1 0.02\n1440.4\n1442.0\n\n1446.7\n1450.4\n\n1445.2\n1450.6\n\nHZ S (AH)\n0.0251 \u00b1 0.0005\n0.105 \u00b1 0.003\n1.046 \u00b1 0.002\n0.103 \u00b1 0.018\n3.05 \u00b1 0.04\n1\n(4.7 \u00b1 1.4)\n(0.062 \u00b1 0.028)\n0.78 \u00b1 0.02\n1442.3\n1448.5\n\nTABLE III: Equivalent of table I but using log10 (G\u03bc/c2 ) as the parameter defining the string amplitude.\n\nCMB\n+SDSS\n+BBN +SDSS/BBN\nNAMBU 2.5 (0.042) 2.3 (0.035) 1.8 (0.021) 1.8 (0.020)\nAH\n5.7 (0.084) 5.3 (0.071) 3.9 (0.038) 3.8 (0.035)\nTABLE IV: Equivalent of table II but using log10 (G\u03bc/c2 ) as the parameter defining the string amplitude.\n\nThe values of f10 we obtain from our analysis constrain the string component to be less than 4.4% of the large scale\namplitude in the case of the Nambu model and 9.3% for the AH model, using the combination of CMB + SDSS data.\nIn the AH case the values we find are smaller than those quoted in ref. [43]. For CMB only, they found a nominal\n2\u03c3 preference for strings with f10 = 0.11 \u00b1 0.05, whereas we only find a 2\u03c3 upper limit of 0.11, corresponding to\nG\u03bc/c2 < 6.8 \u00d7 10\u22127 . We presume that this is as a result of the improved CMB data.\nIt is noticeable that imposing the BBN prior reduces the upper limit on G\u03bc/c2 and f10 . This is because higher\nvalues of G\u03bc/c2 are degenerate with larger values of \u03a9b h2 and nS , as illustrated in ref. [36]. This effect is more\npronounced when using the AH model where there is still some degeneracy without the inclusion of the BBN prior.\nApplying the prior entirely removes the degeneracy between G\u03bc/c2 and nS , as illustrated in the right panel of Fig. 3.\nIn this case, for both the Nambu and AH mimic models we find nS < 1 at around 4\u03c3 significance (\u2206\u03c72 = 16.8 for the\nNambu model and 12.8 for the AH model).\nC.\n\nUsing log10 (G\u03bc/c2 ) as a parameter\n\nFor completeness we have included parameters and limits derived from using log10 (G\u03bc/c2 ) as the parameter to\ndescribe the amplitude of the string power spectrum. The results are summarized in tables III and IV along with\nFig. 4. The results are broadly consistent with those obtained using qstr as the parameter, but there are some\nquantitative differences which come from the different prior space. This means that there is a different measure used\nin the marginalization process. We note that log10 (G\u03bc/c2 ) was used in our earlier work [36], whereas something closer\nto qstr was used in other previous work and this accounts for some of the discrepancies with the results reported in\nref. [43]. There is, of course, no correct choice of parameter and therefore the differences represent the level of \"natural\nuncertainty\" in the parameter estimation process.\nIn this case we find that the upper limits are modified to G\u03bc/c2 < 2.3 \u00d7 10\u22127 for the Nambu model and < 5.3 \u00d7 10\u22127\nfor the AH model using CMB+SDSS, and limits from other data combinations are also strengthened. There are also\nsome small differences in the marginalized values of cosmological parameters which is a result of the different weighting\nin the marginalization process. These differences are slightly larger for the AH model where there is more significant\ndegeneracy between the cosmological parameters and G\u03bc/c2 . As expected, the values of \u2212 log L are more or less\nunchanged between using qstr and log10 (G\u03bc/c2 ).\n\n\f8\n\n\u22125.5\n\nlog10 [G \u03bc/c2]\n\n\u22126\n\u22126.5\n\u22127\n\u22127.5\n\u22128\n0.92\n\n0.94\n\n0.96\nns\n\n0.98\n\n1\n\n0.92\n\n0.94\n\nns\n\n0.96\n\n0.98\n\nFIG. 4: 2D likelihoods of nS versus log10 [G\u03bc/c2 ]. Labeling is the same as in Fig. 3.\n\nD.\n\nBayesian evidence against the Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum\n\nAs a by-product of our analysis, we find there is strong evidence that nS 6= 1 within the 6 parameter family of\n\u039bCDM models. With no strings, including the BBN prior increases the \u2206\u03c72 between HZ and variable nS from 11.9 to\n16.8 (as noted above, a similar \u2206\u03c72 for BBN is also true with strings). One can further quantify this significance by\ncomputing the Bayesian evidence using the Savage-Dickey method (see, for example, ref. [54]). To do this, we assume\nGaussian prior information on nS with mean 1 and standard deviation 0.2. The resulting Bayes factor between HZ and\nvariable nS models is log B = \u22124.5, corresponding to an odds ratio of \u223c 100 : 1, which provides \"moderate-to-strong\"\nevidence that nS 6= 1.\nIV.\n\nCONSTRAINTS ON G\u03bc/c2 FROM PULSAR TIMING\n\nIt is expected that the cosmic string network will emit gravitational waves, the dominant contribution coming\nfrom loop decay [72], leading to a stochastic background which can be constrained by pulsar timing and also recent\nmeasurements made by LIGO [56\u201362]. At this stage those from pulsar timing are the strongest, and therefore we shall\nconcentrate on them. Just as with the limits from the CMB anisotropy there are a number of constraints available in\nthe literature, many of which are contradictory, mainly due to the different assumptions which are made.\nThere are two important issues here: the size of the loops produced by the string network and the spectrum of the\nradiation they produce. These issues require detailed modeling of the behaviour of the string network on small scales\nand an understanding of the impact of radiation backreaction.\nThe size of loops produced is usually assumed to be a constant fraction of the horizon size at formation, \u03b1 =\nl(tf )/dH (t), and will be related to the gravitational backreaction scale by \u03b1 \u223c \u0393 G\u03bc, where \u0393 \u223c 60 is defined below. The\nNambu simulations do not include the effects of radiation backreaction, and we have argued that the AH simulations\ninclude massive radiation at an unnaturally strong level. Therefore, there is no reliable determination of the loop\nproduction size \u03b1 from either type of simulation.\nThe spectrum of radiation emitted by given loop solutions of the Nambu equations of motion can be computed using\nthe quadrupole formula under the assumption that backreaction does not effect the shape of the string trajectory.\nIn particular one finds that the total power emitted by a loop is independent of the size the loop, l, and if given by\nP = \u0393 G\u03bc2 c. This can be written in terms of harmonics of half of the string length, fn = 4\u03c0n/l, as\nP =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nPn ,\n\n(1)\n\nn=1\n\nwhere Pn \u221d n\u2212q . Typically values of q are 4/3 for loops which generate cusps [16], a point on the loop which travels at\n\n\f9\n\nFIG. 5: Pulsar constraints on G\u03bc/c2 as a function of dimensionless loop production size \u03b1.

We also show the relation\n\u03b1 = 60 G\u03bc/c2 (long-dashed).\n\nthe speed of light at some point during its evolution, and 2 for a square loop which has 4 kinks on it [55]. However, this\nsimplification has a significant drawback: it assumes that the string solution is not affected by radiation backreaction.\nThis would mean that the cusps and kinks, both of which are points on the string moving at the speed of light, are\nnot rounded off by the radiation they produce.\nThe issue of gravitational radiation backreaction is difficult to address quantitatively, but it might be possible to\nglean some understanding of the process by studying Goldstone boson radiation from global strings instead. Although\nit is typically much stronger, this radiation is in many other ways similar to gravitational radiation, but in contrast it\ncan be studied using a field theoretic approach. It has been shown that kinks on global strings are rapidly smoothed\nout by Goldstone boson radiation, and an initial kink perturbation is more or less indistinguishable from a sinusoidal\nperturbation after a few timesteps [63]; a similar effect is expected for cusps. This suggests that the radiation spectrum\nfrom a loop will be modifed either by a change in the power law, or strong cut-off at large n.\nIn order to make contact with bounds on a stochastic background of gravitational waves from pulsar timing we\nneed to estimate the spectral energy density of gravitational waves\n\u03a9g =\n\nf d\u03c1g\n,\n\u03c1g df\n\nemitted by the network. This can be related to the dimensionless strain by\n\u0013\n\u0012\nq\n100Hz\n\u221220\n2\n\u03a9g h\n.\nhc = 1.3 \u00d7 10\nf\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n\f10\nIn ref. [57] the effects of varying the power spectrum of radiation from the strings were studied. It was shown\nthat the observed gravitational radiation background in the region relevant for pulsar observations (f \u223c 10\u22129 Hz)\nwas sensitive spectrum of radiation emitted by the strings. In particular, it was shown that the amplitude of the\nbackground at these frequencies was around a factor of 3 higher when q = 4/3 compared to q = 2. A similar result\nwas obtained by truncating the q = 4/3 spectrum at some point n\u2217 \u223c 1000. The reason for this is that the emission\nat this particular frequency receives contributions from loops formed in the radiation era and also those from the\nmatter era if they emit into high harmonics. Whatever one does with the spectrum of radiation emitted by loops from\nthe matter era, the radiation era contribution will remain and, therefore, given the uncertainties in the spectrum of\nradiation from loops discussed above, we will take a conservative approach and just use the radiation era contribution\nas a lower bound on the signal for a given G\u03bc/c2 . Tighter, but less reliable, constraints can be found by including\nthe matter era contribution.\nWe will assume that \u03b1 is undetermined and use the analytic form for the radiation era spectrum presented in\nref. [57]\n2\n\n\u03a9g h = 1.17 \u00d7\n\nG\u03bc\n10\u22124 2\nc\n\n\u0012\n\n2\n1 \u2212 hvrad\ni/c2\n2\n\u03berad \u03a9m\n\n\u0013\n\n(1 + 1.4x)3/2 \u2212 1\n,\nx\n\n(4)\n\nwhere x = \u03b1c2 /(\u0393 G\u03bc) and \u03a9m is the total matter density relative to the critical density. In what follows we use\n2\nparameters measured from the Nambu simulation to give \u03berad , hvrad\ni and we set \u03a9m = 0.3. We will ignore the\nuncertainties in these parameters since their cummulative effect is likely to be less than the uncertainties imposed by\nthe lack of knowledge of \u03b1 and the radiation spectrum.\nThe constraints on G\u03bc/c2 are presented in Fig. 5 for \u0393 = 60 and as a function of \u03b1 for a number of different\npossible values for the limit on \u03a9g h2 . Probably the most reliable of the published limit is \u03a9g h2 < 2 \u00d7 10\u22128 [64].\nThere is stronger published limit of 2 \u00d7 10\u22129 [65], although this is controversial [60]. We have also included the value\nof 9.3 \u00d7 10\u22128 [66] which is that used in ref. [57]. In each case the limit is flat for \u03b1 \u226a \u0393G\u03bc/c2 and is \u221d \u03b1\u22121 for\n\u03b1 \u226b \u0393G\u03bc/c2 ; this asymptotic behaviour can be understood easily from (4). Using the limit of ref. [64] we find that\nG\u03bc/c2 < 7 \u00d7 10\u22127 for \u03b1c2 /(\u0393 G\u03bc) \u226a 1 and G\u03bc/c2 < 5 \u00d7 10\u221211 /\u03b1 for \u03b1c2 /(\u0393 G\u03bc) \u226b 1. In the former case this is\nweaker than the bound from the CMB and in the latter could be much stronger dependent on the value of \u03b1.\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThere are a wide range limits on G\u03bc/c2 presented in the literature, often using identical or at the very least similar\ndata. In this paper we have tried to clarify these issues and present what we believe are current constaints from the\nCMB and large scale structure data, and also from pulsar timing. We have presented evidence that the string spectra\nwhich come from different simulation techniques can all be modelled using the USM with parameters measured in\nsimulations and deduce limits of G\u03bc/c2 < 2.6 \u00d7 10\u22127 if the Nambu simulations are correct and G\u03bc/c2 < 6.4 \u00d7 10\u22127 if\nthe AH simulations are correct. These use CMB+SDSS data and qstr as the parameter. We have also included data\nfrom BBN and used log[G\u03bc/c2 ] as the parameter with similar but quantitatively different conclusions.\nThe limits from pulsar timing could already be much stronger than those from the CMB, for example, if \u03b1 is large.\nHowever, the uncertainties in interpretation of the pulsar limits on \u03a9g h2 are much more severe. At this stage, it seems\nsafest to use the low \u03b1 limit of \u03a9g h2 < 8 \u00d7 10\u22127 , which is one that is unlikely to have to be taken back.\nAs a final point we should note that a network of cosmic strings has another possible observational consequence\nin the CMB, albeit one of lower amplitude: the creation of B-mode polarization [67\u201369] whose detection to very low\nvalues of G\u03bc might be possible if lense cleaning is found to be possible [70]. This is due to the fact that a substantial\nfraction of the anisotropies created by strings are vector modes. In Fig. 6 we have presented the B-mode spectra\nfor the Nambu and AH models with the value of G\u03bc/c2 set to their repsective upper limits. These spectra are very\ndifferent to those predicted in by inflationary models parameterized by the scalar-to-tensor ratio, r which are also\nincluded in the figure. In fact, the spectra for l > 30 are similar to that produced by gravitational lensing particularly\nfor tte Nambu case. This is because the B-mode polarization is created along the line of sight, albeit on different\nscales to the gravitational lensing pf the primary E-mode signal. These spectra comprise a white noise portion and\na peak corresponding to the dominant scale which is on slightly larger scales in the AH model and, by coincidence,\nvery similar to the lensing for the Nambu model. For the Nambu cas this similarity will make them difficult to detect\nunless one can detect the analogue of the reionization bump which peaks around l \u2248 10. It is, however, interesting\nsince most inflationary models which produce strings create very low levels of gravitational waves. It has been shown\nthat it is possible to discriminated them in the AH case [71].\n\n\f11\n\nFIG. 6: B\u2212mode polarization power spectra from strings, tensors and gravitational lensing. For the string spectra, we use\nvalues of G\u03bc/c2 corresponding to the 2\u03c3 upper limit from CMB+SDSS data, that is. G\u03bc/c2 = 2.6 \u00d7 10\u22127 for the USM Nambu\nmodel (solid) and 6.4 \u00d7 10\u22127 for the AH case (dotted). We also show the inflationary primordial tensor spectrum with r = 0.1\nat k = 0.05 Mpc\u22121 (short dashed) and r = 0.01 (long dashed). Finally, we show the gravitational lensing spectrum generated\nfrom E\u2212mode mixing (dot-dash) expected in the inflationary model.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis research was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.
