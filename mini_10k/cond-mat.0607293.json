A Curie-Weiss metallic phase for dopings\nx \u223c 0.7 has been reported[2] where the observed physical\nvariables display an unusual mix of behaviors that are\nhybrid between those of good metals and of insulating\nsystems challenging theory severely. The thermopower\nof NCO is nearly ten times higher than expected from\ntypical metals; generating excitement in the engineering\nand material science communities, particularly applied to\nthermoelectric devices. Here we show that strong electron correlations, along with the geometrically frustrated\nlattice of NCO, hold the key to explaining this mysterious\nstate of matter. We examine several experimentally accessible properties of NCO within the t-J model[3, 4, 5].\nWe find that strong electron correlations capture the essential physics and our results compare well with experiment.\nIn NCO the low spin Cobalt ion valence fluctuates between a Co4+ (spin 1/2) and a Co3+ (spin 0) configuration; the number of Co3+ states is precisely x. The Co\nions form a triangular lattice, and photoemission[6, 7]\nis consistent with a single, hole-like, band with hopping\nt < 0 and n = 1 + x electrons satisfying the Luttinger\nvolume count.\nThe t-J model describes strongly correlated electron\nsystems by forbidding double occupancy of lattice sites.\nWe apply this model to NCO after an electron-hole transformation, requiring t \u2192 \u2212t and hole doping |1 \u2212 n|. A\nnon-zero J couples nearest neighbor electrons via their\nspin degree of freedom. For such strongly correlated systems perturbation theory is doomed to failure from the\noutset and we make progress through numerical exact diagonalization on systems containing 12, 14, and 18 sites\non toroidal clusters (periodic boundary conditions (BC))\nand on ladder clusters (open BC in one direction)[8].\nThermodynamics is considered within the canonical en-\n\nsemble.\nThe Hilbert spaces of these finite systems are very big\n(up to \u223c 80,000 states) and grow exponentially with the\nnumber of sites. Therefore, all available symmetries are\nused to reduce the dimension of the matrices that arise\nto large but manageable proportions. However, Peierls\nphase factors [9] are needed to describe an applied magnetic field, which breaks or reduces the translational invariance, thereby limiting us somewhat. By using a judicious choice of the BC and of phases on bonds[10], we\nachieve a fairly small non-zero flux per plaquette of \u03c0/Nf ;\nwhere Nf is the total number of triangular faces on the\nlattice[8]. The ladder systems, however, enable an infinitesimal flux to be chosen.\nFor NCO, photoemission supports a value for the hopping of t = \u2212100 K and we adopt it in this work. This\nvalue is suggested by the ARPES data[6] on the loss of\ncoherence of the quasiparticles as well as the dispersion\nin the composition range x \u223c .7. The T dependence of\nthe chemical potential \u03bc(T ) \u2212 \u03bc(0) is another route to\nestimating t [11].\nFig. 1(a) shows the electronic specific heat Cv (T ), and\nis compared with that for non-interacting electrons with\nthe same hopping. We find that the effect of correlations is a shift in the peak to a smaller temperature and\nsuppression of its overall weight. This is expected since\nthe Gutzwiller projection in the t-J model reduces the\nnumber of available states and hence the entropy. Due\nto a finite system size induced gap in the spectrum, we\nexpect an exponential behavior of Cv (T ) for T \u2264 20 K,\nthe typical gap value. Taking this into account, we are\nable to extract the linear electronic contribution \u03b3T . The\nvalue of \u03b3 is enhanced by \u223c 1.5 over the non-interacting\nvalue; this enhancement depends only slightly on J (neglecting the exponential increase at T < 20K due to the\nfinite-system-induced gap) and varies with system size by\n0.2. J = 40 K (i.e., 0.4|t|), which is fixed by the experimental system through a comparison of the Curie-Weiss\n\n\f\u03b3~45\n\n3.0\n2.0\n1.0\n0.0\n\n\u03b3~30\n\nJ=.4|t|\nJ=0\n\nx=.79\nPauli\n\n0.5\n\n(b)\n\nU=0\n\n0.0\n\n(e)\n\n-3\n\n\u03c7 [10 emu/mol]\n\n(d)\n\nx=.75\n\n0.5\n\n(c)\n\n0.0\n4.0\n\nx=.71\n\n2.0\n0.0\n4.0\n\nx=.67\n\n2.0\n0.0\n4.0\n\n(f)\n\nJ/|t|\n\nCurie-Weiss\n\n(a)\n\nCv [J/(mol K)]\n\n2\n\nx=.58\n\n2.0\n0.0\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\nT [K]\nFIG. 1: (color online) Specific heat and susceptibility.

The dotted curves indicate the\nbare susceptibility, and arrows indicate the evolution of J/|t|\nfrom 0 to 0.5 in steps of 0.1 (red to yellow). Note the change\nof scale in different panels. These results combine two different clusters, a 12-site torus (x = 0.58, 0.67, 0.75) and a\n14-site torus (x = 0.71, 0.79). The difference in x = 0.71 and\nx = 0.75 shows that \u03c7(T ) transitions from a Curie-Weiss to\nPauli paramagnetic behavior in this range.\n\ntemperature with computations[2, 8].\nIn Fig. 1(b)-(f) we present the spin susceptibility\n\u03c7(T ) for several dopings around x \u223c 0.7. In the band\nlimit x \u2192 1, as in the upper two panels (as well as\nresults not shown), we find the expected weakly T dependent but J insensitive Pauli paramagnetic behavior.\nWhen x is lowered below x = 0.75 (bottom three panels),\n\u03c7(T ) shows strong Curie-Weiss-like T and J dependence,\nand is significantly renormalised from the non-interacting\nvalue at low T . This indicates a crossover to the strongcorrelation induced local moment behavior for x < 0.75\nwhich closely parallels experimental findings[2]. In this\nCurie-Weiss phase, the behavior at high T is described\n\u03bc2 p2\n\nf\nby the Curie-Weiss form \u03c7(T ) = 31 v1 kBB(Tef\n\u2212\u03b8) with a negative Weiss temperature \u03b8 and effective magnetic moment\npef f , v = V /N is the unit cell volume. When continuing\nthe analysis to x \u2192 0, antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations increase and we find that \u03b8(x, J) = \u2212cJef f (x)\n\nwhere Jef f (x) = J(1 + c\u2032\u2032 x|t|) + c\u2032 x|t|, with c = 4.0,\nc\u2032 = 0.01425, and c\u2032\u2032 = \u22120.9175. The c\u2032 term originates in the kinetic antiferromagnetism of the frustrated\nlattice[14], and signifies that even in the absence of J,\nthere is a tendency for AFM order, i.e., in a direction\nopposite to the usual Nagaoka mechanism for the square\nlattice[15].\nExperimentally, the Hall coefficient of NCO is remarkable in many respects. Most striking is the unbounded linear increase with temperature of the Hall coefficient RH . To understand this we perform the brute\nforce exact summations of Kubo's formulae for various\nconductivities[9] by introducing a level width, i.e., a\nbroadening \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c9 + i\u03b7 with \u03b7 equal to the mean energy level spacing. In addition, we evaluate the high fre\u2217\nquency limit[3] of RH (called RH\n) for all T . Recall that\n\u2217\nthe high T estimates of RH led to a prediction[3, 9] of\nthe linear T dependence of the Hall constant for NCO,\nwhich was successfully verified[16]. We are thus able to\nprovide a purely theoretical benchmarking of this idea as\nwell, subject of course to the limitations of the finite size\nclusters.\nFocusing on the region of doping around x \u223c 0.7 Fig.\n2(a) shows the Hall coefficient as a function of temperature and frequency. We find that the Hall coefficient\nis relatively insensitive to frequency, in keeping with the\noriginal expectations[3, 9, 17]. All curves show a minimum near T = 100 K, and an unbounded linear increase\n\u2217\nfor T > 200 K. The slope of RH\nas found in the clusters is in agreement with results from high-temperature\nexpansions[3]. The experimental curve, unlike theory,\nhas a change of sign and also a pronounced minimum\nat T \u223c 100 K. We cannot reproduce the change of sign.\nWhile we could fit the high T slope more accurately, it\nrequires a smaller value of hopping t \u223c 35 K, as already\nnoted[3]. Such a choice would make most other variable fits less sensible. Hence we conclude that while the\ndata[16] is largely as expected from theory, in detail it is\nstill not possible to reconcile the change in sign as well\nas the magnitude of the slope with theory. Therefore,\nthe Hall coefficient still offers a considerable challenge to\nboth theorists and experimentalists.\nIn an alternate effort to understand further the\ndata[16] at lower T \u223c 100 K, we note that the curvature\nof the (Landau) diamagnetic susceptibility \u03c7d (obtained\nby inserting Peierls phases) and the Hall constant are\ncuriously related in our computation via\nT \u2202 2 \u03c7d /\u2202T 2 = f (x)\u2202 2 RH /\u2202T 2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere f (x) is a function depending on doping x. We integrate equation (1) to arrive at the Hall constant from\nour \u03c7d , yielding a good overall fit of data.

(a),\nComparison of several results for the Hall coefficient RH (T )\nat x = 0.75 with experiment in ref. [16] at x = 0.71 (red\n\u2217\nsquares): RH\n(blue dot-dash), RH (\u03c9 = 0) (blue dashed), RH\n(orange solid) derived from \u03c7d (at x = 0.83, ladder), the\ndc-limit required a broadening of the frequency \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c9 + i\u03b7\nwith \u03b7 \u2248 3|t| to eliminate finite-size artifacts.

S \u2217 (T ) for t = \u2212100 K relevant for NCO. The diamonds and stars represent measured\nthermopower for NCO at x = 0.68 from ref. [2] and ref. [13].\n(c), Our prediction for S \u2217 (T ) for the case when the sign of\nthe hopping is reversed (t = 100 K.)\n\nK, with a slight J dependence[8]. While the Landau diamagnetism is very small compared to the paramagnetic\nsusceptibility for narrow band systems, it might yet be\naccessible to experiments. This is so since it is anisotropic\nin space (being planar), in contrast to the isotropic Pauli\nsusceptibility, and hence torque magnetometry[18] could\nhelp disentangle these terms.\nThe thermopower of NCO is striking in its large\nmagnitude[13] \u223c 100\u03bcV /K and also in its surprising sensitivity to an applied magnetic field[2]. A formulation\nfor the thermopower has been recently given[17] in the\nhigh frequency limit in the same spirit as the Hall constant. We note that the thermopower can be written\nas a sum of a transport and the Heikes-Mott term as\nS(\u03c9, T ) = ST r (\u03c9, T ) + SHM (T ), where the Heikes-Mott\n\nST\u2217 r (T ) = lim ST r (\u03c9, T ) =\n\u03c9\u2192\u221e\n\nqe (\u2206(T ) \u2212 \u2206(0))\n.\nT h\u03c4 xx i\n\n(2)\n\nHere qe = \u2212|e| is the electronic charge and \u03c4\u0302xx is the\ndiagonal part of the stress tensor[9, 17]. The term SHM\nis entropic in origin[19]. Detailed expressions for \u2206 as an\nexpectation of a many-body operator in the t-J model\nare given in equation (83) of ref. [17], and in a longer\nwork[8].\nThe main approximation in ref. [17] is to use the high\n\u03c9 limit of S(\u03c9, T ) (called S \u2217 ), and is expected to be numerically quite reasonable, in parallel to the behavior of\nthe Hall constant reported in this work. At low T the two\ncontributions to S vanish separately as we have written\nthem, and in general we find that for t < 0 (the case\nof NCO) the entropic part is by far the dominant term.\nFor the opposite case (t > 0) the transport term comes\ninto play in a dominant way, and leads to very interesting\nbehavior as we shall show.\nWe first discuss the thermopower in the absence of\nmagnetic field. Fig. 2(b) shows the T and J dependence of S \u2217 for x relevant to the Curie-Weiss phase. The\nHeikes-Mott term dominates over the transport term and\nthe frequency dependence of the thermopower (evaluated\nvia Kubo formulae) is found to be quite weak in this\nrange of doping for t < 0 relevant to NCO[8], and thus\nthe high frequency approximation is as good as exact.\nWe find our results compare well with the experimental data[2, 13]. We now sharpen the prediction (from\nEq. (88) of ref. [17]) that reversing the sign of hopping\nleads to a maximum in S \u2217 as a function of T . Fig. 2(c)\nindeed shows such a behavior and provides an estimate\nof the expected enhancement in S \u2217 , a factor of 2 to 3\nover the frustrated case of NCO and also of the expected\ntemperature scale Tmax \u223c |t|. It would be interesting to\ncheck this experimentally. A part of the enhancement\nfor t > 0 arises from the prominent peak in the single\nparticle density of states coming close to the fermi level.\nOur numerics show that interactions further amplify this\neffect considerably (a factor of \u223c 2).\nNext we consider the effects of a magnetic field of\nstrength B (perpendicular to the plane) on the thermopower. The field induced change of the transport term\narises from the Peierls factors, and is found to be a very\nsmall fraction (\u223c 0.001) of the change in the Heikes-Mott\nterm. The field dependence of the chemical potential is\nsignificant and responsible for the overall change. In Fig.\n3(a) we show the normalised SHM (B, T ) for several dopings as function of B/T . This scaling with B/T is very\nsimilar to the one found in ref. [2], both qualitatively and\nquantitatively. In Fig. 3(b)-(d) we find a crossover for\nx \u223c 0.75 from a weakly B-dependent S(B, T ) at x \u2265 0.75\nto the Curie-Weiss phase where S is greatly suppressed\nby B.

These results\nconfirm the interpretation[2] in terms of spin-entropy as\nthe leading contribution to the field-suppression and also\nprovide a guide to what one can expect at high magnetic\nfields that are not accessible experimentally.\nWe next make a few comments about the overall behavior of the thermopower and Hall constant as a function of filling in strong coupling theories. As noted\nearlier[9, 20], while band theory predicts a single zero\ncrossing of the Hall constant as n increases from 0 \u2192 2,\na strongly correlated electron system has three crossings. In precisely the same sense the thermopower also\nhas three zero crossings for a correlated band system.\nWe demonstrate this for the triangular lattice. In Fig.\n4(a)-(b) we show the filling dependence of both the Hall\nconstant and the thermopower. The divergence of the\nHall constant at half filling is forced by the carrier freeze\nout accompanying the Mott-Hubbard gap, and is less\npronounced in the triangular lattice than in the square\nlattice[9]. For the thermopower we expect similar results\nfor the square lattice.\nThe hopping parameter t (\u223c 100 K) used here to reconcile a considerable body of experimental data with theory,\nis much smaller than that in high Tc systems t \u223c 3000\nK. This value is also smaller, by a factor of 10, than the\none found in LDA studies [21, 22], and should motivate\n\nFIG. 4: (color online) Hall coefficient and thermopower as a\n\u2217\nfunction of filling n.
