For j = 1, k = 2 this sequence is the Catalan numbers,\n\nA000108 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences ; for j = 1, k = 3 it is A007226\nand for j = 1, k = 4 it is A007228 . In this note, we give a combinatorial interpretation\nfor all j, k in terms of lattice paths. We first treat the case j = 1, which is simpler (\u00a72),\nspecialize to k = 1 (\u00a73), then generalize to larger j (\u00a74), and end with some remarks (\u00a75).\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nCase j = 1\n\nLet Pn,k denote the set of lattice paths of n+ 1 upsteps U = (1, 1) and (k \u22121)n\u22121 downsteps\n\u0001\nkn\nD = (1, \u22121). Clearly, |Pn,k | = n+1\n: choose locations for the upsteps among the total of kn\n\nsteps. A path in Pn,k has kn + 1 vertices or points: its initial and terminal points and kn \u2212 1\n\ninterior points. Define the baseline of P \u2208 Pn,k to be the line joining its initial and terminal\npoints. For P \u2208 Pn,k label its points 0, 1, 2, . . . , kn left to right and define the k-divisible\npoints of P to be those whose label is divisible by k. An example with n = 5 and k = 3 is\nillustrated (k-divisible points indicated by a heavy dot).\n8\n\nb\n\n1\n\nb\n\n0\n\nb\nb\n\nbb\n\n7\n\n9\n\nb\n\n2\n\nbb\n\n4\n\nb\n\n6\n\nb\n\nb\nb\n\n3\n\n10\nb\n\n11\n\nb\n\nb\n\n5\n\nbb\n\n12\n\n\u0580\nbaseline\n\n14\nb\n\nb\n\n13\n\nbb\n\n15\n\nA path in P5,3\n\nConsider the statistic X on Pn,k defined by X = #interior k-divisible points lying strictly\nabove the baseline. In the illustration X = 3 (points 6, 9 and 12).\nTheorem. The statistic X on Pn,k is uniformly distributed over 0, 1, 2, . . . , n \u2212 1.\nThe following count is an immediate consequence of the theorem by considering the paths\nwith X = n \u2212 1.\nCorollary.\n\n1 kn\nn n+1\n\n\u0001\n\nis the number of paths in Pn,k all of whose interior k-divisible points lie\n\nstrictly above its baseline.\nProof of Theorem Consider the operation \"rotate left k units\" on Pn,k defined by transferring the initial k steps of a path in Pn,k to the end. This rotation operation partitions Pn,k\ninto rotation classes. We claim (i) each such rotation class has size n, and (ii) X assumes\nthe values 0, 1, 2, . . . , n \u2212 1 in turn on the paths of a rotation class. The first claim follows\nfrom\n2\n\n\fLemma. Given P \u2208 Pn,k , the only k-divisible points lying on its baseline are its initial and\nterminal points.\nProof of Lemma Suppose ik, 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n, is a k-divisible point on the baseline. Since the\nslope of the baseline is \u2212 (k\u22122)n\u22122\n, this says that the point with coordinates (ik, \u2212i (k\u22122)n\u22122\n)\nkn\nn\nlies on P (taking the initial point of P as origin). For each point (x, y) on P , x and\nmod 2. Simplifying, we find\ny must have the same even/odd parity. Hence ik \u2261 i (k\u22122)n\u22122\nn\n2i \u2261\n\n2i\nmod2\nn\n\n\u21d2 i \u2261 ni mod1 \u21d2 n| i \u21d2 i = 0 or n, the last implication because 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n.\n\nTo prove the second claim, we exhibit a bijection from the paths in Pn,k with X = n \u2212 1\nto those with X = i for each i \u2208 [0, n \u2212 1]. Given P \u2208 Pn,k with X = n \u2212 1, draw its\nbaseline L. The entire rotation class of P can be viewed in a single diagram: draw a second\ncontiguous copy of P as illustrated, then join the two occurrences of each interior k-divisible\npoint. This results in n parallel line segments (no two collinear, by the Lemma), each the\nbase line of a path in the rotation class of P . Label the lines (at their endpoints) 0 through\nn \u2212 1 from top to bottom.\n\nb\n\nbb\n\nb\n\nb\n\n2 b\n\nb\n\nbb\n\n1\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\n5\n\n3\n\nb\n\nbb\n\nb\nb\n\nb\n\n4 b\n\nb\nb\n\nbb\n\nbb 2\n\nb\n\nb\n\nbb\n\n1\n\nb\n\nb\n\n5\n\nb\n\nbb 3\n\nb\nb\n\nP\n\nbb4\n\nb\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nThe rotation class of P = U DU 3 D 5 U DU D 2 \u2208 P5,3\n\nNow the path Q with baseline i has the form BA when P is decomposed as AB with A\nan initial segment of P . Hence Q is in Pn,k and has X = i since the interior k-divisible points\nof Q lying (strictly) above its baseline are precisely those labeled 1, 2, . . . , i \u2212 1. The path B\ncan be retrieved in Q as the initial subpath of Q terminating at its \"lowest\" k-divisible point\nwhere \"lowest\" is measured relative to the parallel lines, and so the mapping is invertible.\n\n3\n\n\fThe diagram used in this proof is reminiscent of the one used in Concrete Mathematics\n[1, p. 360] to prove Raney's Lemma, also known as the Cycle Lemma [2, 3].\n\n3\n\nSpecial Case\n\nThe case j = 1, k = 2 gives a new interpretation of the Catalan numbers: Cn is the number\nof lattice paths of n + 1 upsteps and n \u2212 1 downsteps such that the interior even-numbered\nvertices all lie strictly above the line joining the initial and terminal points.

Let Pn,k,j denote the\n\u0001\nkn\nset of paths of kn upsteps/downsteps of which n + j are upsteps. Thus |Pn,k,j | = n+j\n.\n\u0001\nj kn\nThe \"j\" factor in the numerator of n n+j requires that we consider the Cartesian product\n\u0001\nkn\n\u2217\n\u2217\nPn,k,j\n:= Pn,k,j \u00d7 [j] whose size is j n+j\n. Given (P, i) \u2208 Pn,k,j\n, introduce an x-y coordinate\nsystem with origin at the initial point of P , identify the parameter i with the line segment\n\njoining (0, 2(i \u2212 1)) and (kn, \u2212(k \u2212 2)n + 2i), and call this the baseline for (P, i); it coincides\nwith the previous notion of baseline when j = 1, forcing i = 1. It is easy to see that,\nonce again, the baseline never contains an interior k-divisible point of P . Define X on\n\u2217\n(P, i) \u2208 Pn,k,j\nby X = # interior k-divisible points of P lying strictly above the baseline.\n\nWe first show that X is uniformly distributed over 0, 1, 2, . . . , n \u2212 1. It is no longer true\nthat orbits in Pn,k,j under the \"rotate left by k\" operator R all have size n but no matter: in\ngeneral, P \u2208 Pn,k,j uniquely has the form P1r with P1 of length divisible by k and r maximal.\nThen r necessarily divides n and j, and the orbit of P under R has size n/r.

First take the highest\nendpoint p and consider the set of all endpoints lying weakly to the left of the vertical line\nthrough p. Since there are j \u2212 1 endpoints directly below p, this set has size at least j. Place\n\n5\n\n\flabel 0 on the j/r highest points in this set, favoring points to the left if a choice must be\nmade between points at the same height. Then take the highest unlabeled endpoint, consider\nthe set of all unlabeled endpoints lying weakly to the left of its vertical line, and place the\nlabel 1 on the j/r highest points in this set, again favoring \"left\". Continue in like manner\nuntil all endpoints are labeled.\nThen, for each i = 0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 1,the j/r objects in the rotation-equivalence class with\nlabel i all have X = i, and the uniform distribution of X follows. By considering the objects\n\u2217\nin Pn,k,j\nwith X = n \u2212 1, we obtain our main result.\n\nMain Theorem. Suppose j \u2265 1, k \u2265 2, and n \u2265\n\nj\n.\nk\u22121\n\nThen\n\nj kn\nn n+j\n\n\u0001\n\nis the number of lattice\n\npaths of n + j upsteps (1, 1) and kn \u2212 (n + j) downsteps (1, \u22121) which (i ) start at (0, \u22122i)\nfor some i \u2265 0, and (ii ) have all interior k-divisible points (strictly) above the line through\nthe origin of slope \u2212 (k\u22122)n\u22122\n.\nkn\n\n5\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nThe main theorem can be generalized somewhat further (essentially the same proof):\n\nan\nd\nn cn+d\n\n\u0001\n\nis the number of lattice paths of cn + d upsteps and an \u2212 (cn + d) downsteps which (i) start\nat (0, \u22122i) for some i \u2265 0, and (ii) have all interior k-divisible points (strictly) above the\nline through the origin of slope \u2212 (a\u22122c)n\u22122\n.\nan\nThere is also a well known generalization of the Catalan numbers in a different direction:\n\u0001\nis the number of lattice paths of n steps east (1,0) and (k \u2212 1)n + j \u2212 1 steps\n\nj\nkn+j\nkn+j\nn\n\nnorth (0, 1) that start at the origin and lie weakly above the line y = (k \u2212 1)x. One way to\nprove this (slightly generalizing the approach in [4]) is as follows. Consider the set Pn,k,j of\npaths consisting of n steps east and (k \u2212 1)n + j steps north. Measuring \"height\" of a point\nabove y = (k \u2212 1)x as the perpendicular distance to y = (k \u2212 1)x, define j high points for\na path P \u2208 Pn,k,j : the first high point is the leftmost of the highest points on the path, the\nsecond high point is the leftmost of the next highest points of the path, and so on. Note\nthat all j high points necessarily lie strictly above y = (k \u2212 1)x. Mark any one of the these\n\u0001\n\u2217\n\u2217\nhigh points to obtain the set Pn,k,j\nof marked Pn,k,j -paths. Clearly, |Pn,k,j\n| = j kn+j\n. Label\nn\n6\n\n\f\u2217\nthe kn + j + 1 points on a marked path P \u2217 \u2208 Pn,k,j\nin order 0, 1, 2, . . . , kn + j starting at\n\nthe origin. Set X = label of the marked high point. Then X is uniformly distributed over\n1, 2, . . . , kn + j. The paths with X = kn + j yield the desired paths by deleting the last step\n(necessarily a north step) and rotating 180\u25e6 .\nAll the above generalizations of the Catalan numbers are incorporated in the expression\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nad \u2212 bc an + b\nan + b \u2212 1\nan + b \u2212 1\n\u2212c\n= (a \u2212 c)\ncn + d\ncn + d \u2212 1\nan + b cn + d\nand it would be interesting to find a unified combinatorial interpretation for it.\n\nReferences\n[1] R.
