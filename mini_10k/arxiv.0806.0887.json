In this case for q = 0.62685, the state has zero three tangle and zero three-way\nnegativity, having only W-like entanglement. The difference between the product of global and\npartial three way negativity and three tangle for a given state is a quantitative measure of two qubit\ncoherences transformed by unitary transformations on canonical state into three qubit coherences.\nThe global negativity and partial K\u2212way negativities, obtained by selective partial transpositions\non multi-qubit state operator, satisfy inequalities which for three qubits are equivalent to CKW\n(Coffman-Kundu-Wootter) inequality.\n\nQuantifying multipartite entanglement is an important problem in quantum information theory [1]. A multipartite\nquantum system can have more than one type of qualitatively distinct quantum correlations since a given subsystem\nmay be entangled to the rest in many different ways. Consequently, a single quantity can not characterize multipartite\nentanglement. The first step towards understanding the amount and nature of entanglement available to a given party\nholding part of the composite system, is to quantify the quantum correlations present in the composite system state.\nPeres- Horodecki [2, 3] positive partial transpose is a widely used separability criterian for a bipartite state. Negativity\n[4] of the partial transpose of an entangled state has been shown to be an entanglement monotone [5]. In a recent\npaper [6], we defined K\u2212way negativities to characterize K\u2212partite quantum correlations in a multipartite state. The\nspecific constraints applied during the construction of K\u2212way partial transpose of a state \u03c1b = |\u03a8i h\u03a8| relate the partial\nK\u2212way negativiy to K\u2212partite correlations present in the state in a very natural way. The global partial transpose\ncan be written as a sum of K\u2212way partial transposes. The partial K\u2212way negativity, defined as the contribution\nof K\u2212way partial transpose to global negativity, quantifies the K\u2212partite coherences of the state. A pure state \u03a8\ncan be transformed, through local unitary operations and classical communication (LOCC), to a state \u03a8c such that\nboth the states perform the same tasks in quantum information processing, however, the probabilities of success may\nbe different. If \u03a8c is a superposition of minimum number of local basis states and depends on coeficients that are\nnon-local invariants [7], it is called a canonical state. The states \u03a8 and \u03a8c have the same entanglement content but\ndifferent quantum coherences. It was conjectured in [6] that the global negativities and partial K\u2212way negativities\ncalculated for the N\u2212partite canonical state are entanglement measures. In this letter, we show that for the case\nof three qubit states, the two-way and three-way partial negativities calculated for the generic canonical states are\nindeed entanglement monotones. Three tangle, introduced by coffman et al. [8], is a widely used measure of GHZ\nlike entanglement of a three qubit state. The three tangle has been shown to be an entanglement monotone [9]. We\nshow that the product of global negativity and partial 3\u2212way negativity for the generic three qubit canonical state\n[10] is equal to three tangle, while the product of global negativity and partial 2\u2212way negativity for a given pair of\nqubits equals the tangle. To further elucidate the relation between the three tangle and partial K\u2212way negativities\nof the canonical state, we analyze the global and partial K\u2212way negativities (K = 2, 3) of a single parameter pure\nstate, obtained by taking a linear combination of a GHZ state and a W state.\n\n\u2217 shelly@uel.br\n\u2020 nsharma@uel.br\n\n\f2\nI.\n\nPARTIAL K\u2212WAY NEGATIVITIES AND THREE TANGLE FOR GENERIC THREE QUBIT\nCANONICAL STATE\n\nThe Hilbert space associated with a quantum system composed of three sub-systems is spanned by basis vectors of\nthe form |i1 i2 i3 i , where im = 0 to (dm \u2212 1) , dm being the dimension of Hilbert space associated with mth sub-system.\nWe refer to the first, second and third sub-system as A, B, and C.

For x3 6= 4, the partial 3\u2212way negativity of the state (using Eq.(20)),\n\nis non zero for a000 6= 0, and a111 6= 0.\nThe canonical state for x3 = 4 reads as\n\n2a000 a2111\nE3A = q\n,\n2\n2\n1 \u2212 (a000 ) \u2212 (a111 )\n\n\u03a8c (q = 0.62685) = \u22120.567 31 |010i \u2212 0.567 31 |100i + 0.185 78 |110i + 0.567 31 |111i ,\n\n(39)\n\n(40)\n\u0001\n\u2212)\n\nA\n= 0\ngiving NG\n= E2A = 0.910 3,\nE3A = 0.This result is consistent with the fact that three tangle \u03c43 \u03a8\nfor q = 0.62685. The W-like tripartite entanglement of the state \u03a8c (q = 0.62685) arises solely from two-body\ncoherences measured by nonzero E2A .of the canonical state. The GHZ like tripartite entanglement of a three qubit\nstate is due to three-body coherences (nonzero E3A of canonical state). Two- body correlations generate W-like\ntripartite entanglement and pairwise entanglement of qubits. A mixed state, \u03c1bmixed , can be decomposed as a convex\ncombination of projectors onto pure states as\nX\nPi \u03c1bi ,\n\u03c1bi = |\u03a8i i h\u03a8i | ,\n\u03c1bmixed =\ni\n\nwhere Pi is the probability of fnding the state \u03c1bi . For the mixed states, we define the convex roof extended Global\nand K\u2212way negativities through\nX\nPi N p (b\n\u03c1i ) .\n(41)\nN p (b\n\u03c1mixed ) = min\ni\n\nP\n\nPi N p (b\n\u03c1i ) taken over all possible decompositions of \u03c1bmixed is defined as N p (b\n\u03c1mixed ).

It is not possible to\ntransform three-body correlations into purely two-body correlations by local operations and classical communication.\nTo summarize, we have shown that for generic three qubit canonical state the product of global negativity and\npartial three way negativity is equal to three tangle, which is an entanglement monotone, quantifying GHZ-like three\nqubit quantum correlations. The product of global negativity and partial two way negativity for a given pair of qubits\nin the canonical state is seen to be equal to tangle for the pair. It proves that the K\u2212way negativities associated with\nthe three qubit canonical state are indeed entanglement measures. The importance of this result lies in the ease with\nwhich the partial K\u2212way negativities can be calculated for multipartite canonical states and the physical meaning\nassociated to partial K\u2212way negativities as measures of K\u2212partite coherences. The global negativity and partial\nK\u2212way negativities, obtained by selective partial transpositions on multi-qubit state operator, satisfy inequalities\nwhich for three qubits are equivalent to CKW (Coffman-Kundu-Wootter) inequality. The difference between the\nvalues of product of global and partial three way negativity for a given state and three tangle for the state is a\nquantitative measure of two qubit correlations transformed by unitary transformations on canonical state into three\nqubit correlations. We have also calculated the partial K\u2212way negativities and three tangle for the state canonical\nto a single parameter (0 < q < 1) pure state which is a linear combination of a GHZ state and a W state. In this case\nfor q = 0.62685, the state has zero three tangle as well as zero three-way negativity, having only W-like entanglement.\nFor mixed states the relevant entanglement measures are convex roof extended global and K\u2212way negativities. The\nGHZ-like and W-like state are found to differ in the amount and type of quantum correlations present in canonical\nform. The N-qubit states may also be classified according to the amount and type of K\u2212way coherences (2 \u2264 K \u2264 N )\npresent in the canonical form. We expect the use of partial K\u2212way negativities to enhance our understanding of\nquantum correlations and entanglement in multipartite systems.\nFinancial support from Faep-UEL, Brazil is acknowledged.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n\nD.
