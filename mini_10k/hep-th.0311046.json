Introduction\nThe current description of strong interactions is based on QCD, whose dynamics becomes\nnonperturbative at energies of order \u039bQCD . Confinement, which can be defined as the\nabsence in the observed spectrum of asymptotic states that carry a color charge, is commonly associated to a nonperturbative, linearly rising potential between color sources - for\nrecent discussions on confinement see e.g. [1, 2] and references therein. Such a potential is\nindeed consistent with the Regge trajectories observed in the hadronic spectrum and hints\nto a picture where hadrons are made of quarks joined by flux tubes of chromoelectric field.\nString theory was originally introduced as an effective theory to describe the dynamics\nof these flux tubes. Numerical simulations of gauge theories regulated on a lattice are\nan effective tool to investigate nonperturbative properties from first principles; they have\nconfirmed the existence of such a linear potential, have provided good evidence in favor\nof a bosonic string description, and have studied in some details the structure of the flux\ntubes.\nWhile this picture is generally accepted nowadays, the mechanism which is responsible\nfor confinement is still under active debate. New aspects of the mechanism of confinement\nmay be evidentiated by studying SU(N ) gauge theories for N > 3, under the assumption\nthat all these theories share the same basic properties with corrections that are organised\nin powers of 1/N . These ideas have triggered a recent interest in the spectrum of k-strings\nin SU(N ) gauge theories. A k-string is defined as the confining flux tube between sources\nin higher representations, carrying a charge k with respect to the center of the gauge group\nZN , i.e. representations with nonvanishing N -ality. These sources can be seen as the\nsuperposition of k fundamental charges, and charge conjugation exchanges k- and (N \u2212 k)strings, so that non trivial k-strings exist only for N > 3 1 ; their string tensions \u03c3k can\n1\n\nWe shall not consider in this work high-dimensional representations that are screened by gluons and\ndo not yield a genuine asymptotic string tension.\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fbe - and should be - used to constrain mechanisms of confinement [3, 4]. Results for the\nvalues of \u03c3k can be obtained by various approaches. Early results, based on dimensional\nreduction arguments, suggest the so-called \"Casimir scaling\" hypothesis for the ratio of\nstring tensions [5]:\nR(k, N ) \u2261\n\n\u03c3k\nk(N \u2212 k)\n=\n\u2261 C(k, N )\n\u03c31\nN \u22121\n\n(1.1)\n\nsin (k\u03c0/N )\n.\nsin (\u03c0/N )\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere \u03c31 is the fundamental string tension. Recent studies in supersymmetric Yang-Mills\ntheories and M-theory suggest instead a \"Sine scaling\" formula:\nR(k, N ) =\n\nCorrections are expected to both formulae, but the form of such corrections is unknown\nfor the physically relevant case of a four dimensional, nonsupersymmetric, SU(N ) gauge\ntheory.\nIn the large-N limit, where the interactions between flux tubes are suppressed by\npowers of 1/N , the lowest energy state of the system should be made of k fundamental\nflux tubes connecting the sources; hence:\nk\u2212fixed\n\nR(k, N ) N\u2192\u221e\n\u2212\u2192 k.\n\n(1.3)\n\nBoth the Casimir and the Sine scaling formulae satisfy this constraint; they also remain\ninvariant under the replacement k \u2192 (N \u2212 k), which corresponds to the exchange of quarks\nwith antiquarks. However, it has been argued in Refs. [6, 7] that the correction to the\nlarge-N behavior should occur as a power series in 1/N 2 rather than 1/N . 2 Clearly such\na behavior would exclude Casimir scaling as an exact description of the k-string spectrum.\nRecent lattice calculations have provided new results for the spectrum of k-strings both\nin three and four dimensions [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. They all confirm that Casimir scaling is a\ngood approximation to the Yang-Mills results. To be more quantitative, one could say that\nall lattice results are within 10% of the Casimir scaling prediction, and that deviations\nfrom it are larger in four than they are in three dimensions, in agreement with strongcoupling predictions [12]. The taming of systematic errors is a crucial matter for such\nlattice calculations, and it can only be achieved by an intensive numerical analysis. In four\ndimensions, the higher statistics simulations presented in Ref. [12] show that corrections to\nthe Casimir scaling formula are statistically significant, and actually favor the Sine scaling.\nFinally, it has been pointed out in Ref. [13] that higher-dimensional representations with\ncommon N -ality do yield the same string tension, as expected because of gluon screening.\nThese numerical results trigger a few comments on Casimir scaling. The original\nargument [5] was based on the idea that a 4-d gauge theory in a random magnetic field\ncould be described by a 2-d theory without such a field. Besides the numerical results,\nthere is little support for such an argument in QCD; moreover it is not clear that the same\n2\n\nOne should study with some care whether the arguments presented in Refs. [6, 7] hold independently\nof the space-time dimensionality.\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fhypothesis could explain the approximate Casimir scaling observed in three dimensions.\nOn the other hand, Casimir scaling appears \"naturally\" as the lowest order result, both at\nstrong-coupling in the case of k-strings in the hamiltonian formulation of gauge theories,\nand in the case of the spectrum of bound states in chiral models. Corrections can be\ncomputed in the strong-coupling formulation and they turn out to be \u221d (d \u2212 2)/N - see e.g.\nRef. [12] for a summary of results and references. While we are aware that strong-coupling\ncalculations are not directly relevant to describe the physics of the continuum theory, we\nthink that it is nonetheless instructive to have some quantitative analytic control within\nthat framework. Last but not least, Casimir scaling also appears at the lowest order in the\nstochastic model of the QCD vacuum [14]. In view of these considerations, it is fair to say\nthat approximate Casimir scaling should be a prerequisite for any model of confinement,\nthat corrections should be expected, and that these corrections are liable to yield further\ninformations about the non-perturbative dynamics of strong interactions. Moreover, it\nwould be very interesting to improve our understanding of some other aspects of the kstring spectrum, like e.g. the origin of the Sine scaling for non-supersymmetric theories,\nor the structure of the corrections to this scaling form.\nIn order to get more insight in the dynamics underlying the k-string spectrum, we\ncompute in this paper the ratio R(k, N ) in the 3-d SU(N ) Georgi-Glashow model. This\nmodel, in the (N = 2)-case, is a classic example [15] of a theory, which allows for an\nanalytic description of confinement. The latter is due to the plasma of point-like magnetic\nmonopoles, which produce random magnetic fluxes through the contour of the Wilson loop.\nIn the weak-coupling regime of the model (which is assumed henceforth), this plasma is\ndilute, and the interaction between monopoles is Coulombic, being induced by the dualphoton exchanges. Since the energy of a single monopole is a quadratic function of its flux,\nit is energetically favorable for the vacuum to support a configuration of two monopoles\nof unit charge (in the units of the magnetic coupling constant, gm ), rather than a single,\ndoubly-charged monopole. Owing to this fact, monopoles of unit charge dominate in the\nvacuum, whereas monopoles with higher charges tend to dissociate into them. Summing\nover the grand canonical ensemble of monopoles of unit charge, interacting with each other\nby the Coulomb law, one arrives at an effective low-energy theory, which is a 3-d sineGordon theory of a dual photon. The latter acquires a mass (visible upon the expansion\nof the cosine potential) by means of the Debye screening in the Coulomb plasma. The\nappearance of this (exponentially small) mass and, hence, of a finite (albeit exponentially\nlarge) vacuum correlation length is crucial for the generation of the fundamental string\ntension, i.e., for the confinement of the external fundamental matter. It is worth noting\nthat a physically important interpretation of these ideas in terms of spontaneous breaking\nof magnetic Z2 symmetry has been presented in reviews [16] and refs. therein.\nIn the next section, we formalize this qualitative discussion and describe the SU(N )generalization of the model, thereby introducing the notations used throughout this paper.\nIn section 3, we proceed directly with the evaluation of the k-string tensions in the SU(N )version of the model, first in the dilute-plasma approximation, and then with the leading\nnon-diluteness correction taken into account. In section 4, we consider other possible\ncorrections, which stem from the finiteness of the Higgs-boson mass and from the closed\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\felectric strings, present in the model. Finally, in section 5, the main results of the paper\nare summarized, and possible generalizations to the 4-d case are discussed.\n\n2. The model\nThe Euclidean action of the 3-d Georgi-Glashow model reads [15]\n\u0014\nZ\n\u00112 \u0015\n\u0001\n1\n\u03bb\u0010 a 2\n1\n3\n2\na 2\na 2\nS= d x\n(\u03a6 ) \u2212 \u03b7\n,\nF\n+ (D\u03bc \u03a6 ) +\n4g 2 \u03bc\u03bd\n2\n4\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere the Higgs field \u03a6a transforms by the adjoint representation, i.e., D\u03bc \u03a6a \u2261 \u2202\u03bc \u03a6a +\n\u03b5abc Ab\u03bc \u03a6c . The weak-coupling regime g2 \u226a mW parallels then the requirement that \u03b7\nshould be large enough to ensure the spontaneous symmetry breaking from SU(2) to U(1).\nAt the perturbative level, the spectrum of the model in the Higgs phase is made of a\nmassless photon, two heavy, charged W -bosons with mass mW = g\u03b7, and a neutral Higgs\n\u221a\nfield with mass mH = \u03b7 2\u03bb.\nWhat is however more important is the nonperturbative content of the model, represented by the famous 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole [17, 18]. It is a solution to the classical\nequations of motion, which has the following Higgs- and vector-field parts\nr\u2192\u221e\n\n\u2022 \u03a6a = \u03b4a3 u(r), u(0) = 0, u(r) \u2212\u2192 \u03b7 \u2212\n\ne\u2212mH r\ngr ;\n\nr\u2192\u221e\n\n\u2022 A1,2\nx) \u2212\u2192 O (e\u2212mW r ), H\u03bc \u2261 \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u2202\u03bd A3\u03bb =\n\u03bc (~\n\nx\u03bc\nr3\n\n\u2212 4\u03c0\u03b4(x1 )\u03b4(x2 )\u03b8(x3 )\u03b4\u03bc3 ;\n\n2\n\u2022 as well as the following action S0 = 4\u03c0\u01eb\n\u03ba . Here, \u03ba \u2261 g /mW is the weak-coupling\nparameter, \u01eb = \u01eb (mH /mW ) is a certain monotonic, slowly varying function, \u01eb \u2265 1,\n\u01eb(0) = 1 (BPS-limit) [19], \u01eb(\u221e) \u2243 1.787 [20].\n\nThe following approximate saddle-point solution (which becomes exact in the BPSlimit) has been found in ref. [15]:\nN\ng2 X\nS = N S0 + m\n8\u03c0 a,b=1\na6=b\n\ne\u2212mH |~za \u2212~zb |\nqa qb\n\u2212\n|~za \u2212 ~zb |\n|~za \u2212 ~zb |\n\n!\n\n\u0012\n\u0011\n\u0010\n2\n+ O gm\nmH e\u22122mH |~za \u2212~zb | + O\n\n1\nmW R\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\nza \u2212 ~zb |, ggm = 4\u03c0, [gm ] = [mass]\u22121/2 . Therefore, while at mH \u2192 \u221e,\nwhere m\u22121\nW \u226a R \u226a |~\nthe usual compact-QED action is recovered, in the BPS-limit one has\nS \u2243 N S0 +\n\nN\n2 X\nqa qb \u2212 1\ngm\n,\n8\u03c0 a,b=1 |~za \u2212 ~zb |\na6=b\n\ni.e., the interaction of two monopoles doubles for opposite and vanishes for equal charges.\nTherefore, in this limit, the standard monopole-antimonopole Coulomb plasma recombines itself into two mutually noninteracting subsystems, consisting of monopoles and antimonopoles. The interaction between the objects inside each of these subsystems has a\ndouble strength with respect to the interaction in the initial plasma.\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fWhen mH < \u221e, the summation over the grand canonical ensemble of monopoles has\nbeen performed in ref. [21] and reads\nZmon\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\nN Z\nX\nX\n\u03b6N Y\n=1+\ne\u2212S =\nd3 za\nN!\nN =1\n\na=1\n\nqa =\u00b11\n\n\u001a Z\n\u0014\n\u0015\u001b\nm2H 2\n1\n1\n3\n2\n2\ngm \u03c8\nD\u03c7D\u03c8 exp \u2212 d x (\u2202\u03bc \u03c7) + (\u2202\u03bc \u03c8) +\n\u03c8 \u2212 2\u03b6e\ncos(gm \u03c7) .\n2\n2\n2\n\n(2.2)\n\nHere, \u03c7 is the dual-photon field and \u03c8 is the field additional with respect to compact QED,\nwhich describes the Higgs boson. Furthermore, the monopole fugacity (i.e., the statistical\nweight of a single monopole), \u03b6, has the following form [15]\n7/2\n\n\u03b6=\u03b4\n\nmW \u2212S0\ne\n.\ng\n\n(2.3)\n\nThe function \u03b4 = \u03b4 (mH /mW ) is determined by the loop corrections. It is known [22]\nthat this function grows in the vicinity of the origin (i.e., in the BPS limit). However, the\nspeed of this growth is such that it does not spoil the exponential smallness of \u03b6 in the\nweak-coupling regime under study.\nFor the analysis of k-strings in the next sections, we will need the SU(N )-generalization\nof the partition function (2.2), which reads\nZ\nN\nZmon\n= D~\n\u03c7D\u03c8 \u00d7\n\uf8ee\n\n\u00d7 exp \uf8f0\u2212\n\nZ\n\n\uf8eb\n\nm2H\n\n1\n1\nd3 x \uf8ed (\u2202\u03bc \u03c7\n~ )2 + (\u2202\u03bc \u03c8)2 +\n\u03c8 2 \u2212 2\u03b6egm \u03c8\n2\n2\n2\n\nN (N \u22121)/2\n\nX\ni=1\n\n\uf8f6\uf8f9\n\ncos (gm ~qi \u03c7\n~ )\uf8f8\uf8fb . (2.4)\n\nIt has been taken into account here that, in the SU(N )-case, monopole charges are distributed along the (N \u2212 1)-dimensional positive root vectors ~qi 's of the group SU(N ) [23],\nwhile charges of antimonopoles are represented by roots, that are negative symmetric\nto those of monopoles. Clearly, the dual-photon field is now described by the (N \u2212 1)dimensional vector \u03c7\n~ . In the next section, we will study k-strings in the compact-QED\nlimit of this theory, while corrections due to the propagation of the Higgs field will be\naddressed in section 4.\n\n3. k-strings in the weakly coupled SU(N) 3-d Georgi-Glashow model\nIn the compact-QED limit, the partition function (2.4) takes the following sine-Gordon\u2013\ntype form:\n\uf8f6\uf8f9\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ee\nZ\nZ\nN (N \u22121)/2\nX\n1\n(3.1)\n~ )2 \u2212 2\u03b6\ncos (gm ~qi \u03c7\n~ )\uf8f8\uf8fb .\nZmon = D~\n\u03c7 exp \uf8f0\u2212 d3 x \uf8ed (\u2202\u03bc \u03c7\n2\ni=1\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fN (NP\n\u22121)/2\n\nqi\u03b1 qi\u03b2 =\n\nN \u03b1\u03b2\n2\u03b4 ,\n\n\u03b1, \u03b2 = 1, . . . , N \u2212 1, the\n\u221a\nfollowing value of the Debye mass of the dual photon stems from eq. (3.1): m = gm N \u03b6.\nThe k-string tension is defined by means of the k-th power of the fundamental Wilson\nloop.

(3.2) of the choice of \u03a3(C) can readily be seen in the same\nway as for the (k = 1)-case (see e.g. ref. [24]). 3 The \u03a3-dependence rather appears\nin the weak-field, or low-density, approximation, when one may keep only the quadratic\nterm in the expansion of the cosine in eq. (3.1). It has been shown in ref. [24] that the\nnotion \"low-density\" implies that the typical monopole density is related to the mean one,\n\u03c1mean = \u03b6N (N \u2212 1), by the following sequence of inequalities:\n\u0001\n\u03c1typical \u226a \u03b6 * O(N ) \u226a \u03c1mean = \u03b6 * O N 2 .\n\nBelow in this section, we will discuss in some more details the correspondence between the\nlow-density approximation and the large-N one.\nR\nDenoting for brevity ~a \u2261 \u2212g d3 x\u03a3 (~x) \u03c7\n~ (~x), we can rewrite eq.

[24]). In particular, the fundamental string tension reads [24] \u03c31 = N2N\n\u221a\n\n\u22121\nwhere \u03c3\u0304 \u2261 4\u03c0 2 g\u03b6N\n, and the factor N2N\nis the square of a weight vector.\nm\nTo evaluate eq. (3.3) for k > 1, we should calculate the expressions of the form\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8edn~\u03bcai +\n\nk\u2212n\nX\nj=1\n\n\uf8f62\n\n~\u03bcaj \uf8f8 ,\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere (k \u2212 n) weight vectors ~\n\u03bcaj 's are mutually different and also different from the vector\n\u0001\n\u03bc\n~ ai . By virtue of the formula ~\n\u03bca ~\n\u03bcb = 12 \u03b4ab \u2212 N1 , we obtain for eq. (3.5):\n\"\n#\nk\u2212n\u22121\nX\n\u0001\n\u0001\nN \u22121 2\nk(N \u2212 k) 1 2\n1\n2n(k \u2212 n) + 2\nl =\n+\nn +k\u2212n \u2212\nn \u2212n .\n2N\n2N\n2N\n2\n\n(3.6)\n\nl=1\n\nWe should further calculate the number of times a term with a given n appears in the\nsum (3.5). In what follows, we will consider the case k < N , although k may be of the\nk!\npossibilities exist to choose out of k weight vectors n\norder of N . Then, Ckn \u2261 n!(k\u2212n)!\ncoinciding ones, whose index may acquire any values from 1 to N . The index of any weight\nvector out of other (k \u2212 n) ones may then acquire only (N \u2212 1) values, and so on. Finally,\nthe index of the last weight vector may acquire (N \u2212 k + n) values. Therefore, the desired\nnumber of times, a term with a given n appears in the sum (3.5), reads:\nCkn N * (k \u2212 n)(N \u2212 1) * (k \u2212 n \u2212 1)(N \u2212 2) * * * 1(N \u2212 k + n) =\n(k \u2212 n)! =\n= Ckn Ak\u2212n+1\nN\n\nk!N !\n,\nn!(n + N \u2212 k \u2212 1)!\n\n(3.7)\n\nN!\n. Equations (3.6) and (3.7) together yield for the monopole\n\u2261 (N \u2212k+n\u22121)!\nwhere Ak\u2212n+1\nN\ncontribution to the Wilson loop, eq.

We have thus arrived at a Feynman-Kac\u2013type formula, where, in the\nasymptotic regime of interest, S \u2192 \u221e, only the first term in the sum is essential. The\nk-string tension therefore reads \u03c3k = C \u03c3\u0304, that yields the Casimir-scaling law (1.1). It is\ninteresting to note that the Casimir of the original unbroken SU(N ) group is recovered.\nThis is a consequence of the Dirac quantization condition [23], which distributes the quark\ncharges along the weights of the fundamental representation and the monopole ones along\nthe roots. The orthonormality of the roots then yields the action (3.4), which is diagonal in the dual magnetic variables; the sum of the weights squared is responsible for the\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fCasimir factor, since C = (~\n\u03bca1 + * * * + ~\u03bcak )2 , where all k weight vectors are different from\neach other. Therefore, terms where all k weight vectors are mutually different yield the\n!\ndominant contribution to the sum (3.3). Their number in the sum is equal to (Nk!N\n\u2212k)! , that\ncorresponds to the (n = 1)-term in eq. (3.8).\nLet us further address the leading correction to the obtained Casimir scaling, which\noriginates from the non-diluteness of plasma. Expanding the cosine on the r.h.s. of eq. (3.1)\nup to the quartic term, we obtain the action 4\nZ\n\n1\nm2\n(\u2202\u03bc \u03c7\n~ )2 +\nd x\n2\n2\n3\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0012\n\n2\ngm\n\u03c7\n~4\n\u03c7\n~ \u2212\n12(N + 1)\n2\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n.\n\n(3.9)\n\nBy virtue of this formula, one can analyse the correspondence between the 1/N -expansion\nand corrections to the low-density approximation. The natural choice for defining the\nbehavior of the electric coupling constant in the large-N limit is the QCD-inspired one,\ng = O(N \u22121/2 ). To make some estimates in this case, let us use an obvious argument that\na\u03c7\n~ -field configuration dominating in the partition function is the one, where every term\nin the action (3.9) is of the order of unity. When applied to the kinetic term, this demand\ntells us that the characteristic wavelength l of the field \u03c7\n~ is related to the amplitude of this\n\u22122\nfield as l \u223c |~\n\u03c7| . Substituting further this estimate into the condition l3 m2 |~\n\u03c7|2 \u223c 1, we\n2 /N , can\nget |~\n\u03c7|2 \u223c m. The ratio of the quartic\nand mass terms, being of the order |~\n\u03c7|2 gm\nq\n\u221a\n2\n\u03b6\n3\nm\nthen be estimated as mg\nN = gm\nN \u223c N \u03b6. With the exponentially high accuracy, this\nratio is small, provided\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(3.10)\nN . O eS0 /2 .\nTherefore, the non-diluteness corrections are suppressed not at large N , but rather at N 's\nbounded from above by a certain exponentially large parameter.\nTo proceed with the study of the non-diluteness correction, one needs to solve iteratively the saddle-point equation, corresponding to the average (3.2) taken with respect to\nthe approximate action (3.9). Since\nit has beenE demonstrated above that the string tenD\n\u03bcak )\ni~a(\u03bc\n~ a1 +***+~\n, where all k weight vectors are mutually\nsion is defined by the averages e\ndifferent, let us restrict ourselves only to such terms in the sum (3.3). Solving then the\nsaddle-point equation with the Ansatz \u03c7\n~=\u03c7\n~0 + \u03c7\n~ 1 , where |~\n\u03c71 | \u226a |~\n\u03c70 |, we obtain for such\na term:\nD\n\n\u03bcak )\ni~a(\u03bc\n~ a1 +***+~\n\n\u2212 ln e\n\nE\n\ng2\n= C\n2\n\nZ\n\nd3 xd3 y\u03a3 (~x) Dm (~x \u2212 ~y ) \u03a3 (~y) + \u2206S,\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhere Dm (~x) = e\u2212m|~x| /(4\u03c0|~x|) is the Yukawa propagator. The first term on the r.h.s.\nof eq. (3.11) yields the string tension \u03c3k = C \u03c3\u0304, while the second term yields the desired\ncorrection.

The latter fact enables one to write down the following final result\nfor the leading correction to eq.

The fact that at k \u223c N \u226b 1 the obtained\ncorrection to the Casimir-scaling law is O(1), indicates that non-diluteness effects, once\nbeing taken into account, can significantly distort the Casimir-scaling behavior.\n\n4. Corrections due to the Higgs field and closed strings\nAs we have seen in section 2, when one deviates from the compact-QED limit, i.e., makes\nthe Higgs field not infinitely heavy, it starts propagating and opens up an interaction in the\nmonopole plasma via the scalar (rather than vector) component of the monopole solution.\nThe respective partition function is given by eq. (2.4). Averaging in that equation over\nthe Higgs field by means of the cumulant expansion one gets in the second order of this\nexpansion [25]:\n\nZmon \u2243\n\n+2\u03be 2\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n\uf8ee\n\nD~\n\u03c7 exp \uf8f0\u2212\nd3 xd3 y\n\nZ\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1\n~ )2 \u2212 2\u03be\nd3 x \uf8ed (\u2202\u03bc \u03c7\n2\n\nN (N \u22121)/2\n\nX\n\ni,j=1\n\nN (N \u22121)/2\n\nX\ni=1\n\n\uf8f6\n\ncos (gm ~qi \u03c7\n~ )\uf8f8 +\n\uf8f9\n\ncos (gm ~qi \u03c7\n~ (~x)) K(~x \u2212 ~y ) cos (gm ~qj \u03c7\n~ (~y ))\uf8fb .\n\n(4.1)\n\nh 2\n\u0001i\nis the modified fugacity (which can be shown\nIn this equation, \u03be \u2261 \u03b6 exp g2m DmH m\u22121\nW\nto remain exponentially small as long as the cumulant expansion is convergent) and K(x) \u2261\n2\negm DmH (x) \u2212 1. The Debye mass of the dual photon, stemming from eq. (4.1), reads\nm = gm\nwhere I \u2261\n\nR\n\np\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\nN (N \u2212 1)\n,\nN \u03be 1 + \u03beI\n2\n\nd3 xK(x). At mH \u223c mW , the following value of I has been obtained [25]:\n\n\u0013\n4\u03c0 \u2212mH /mW\ne\n.\n(4.2)\n\u03ba\n\u0001\nThe parameter of the cumulant expansion is O \u03beIN 2 . By virtue of eqs. (2.3) and (4.2),\none can readily see that the condition for this parameter to be (exponentially) small reads\n\u0001\u0003\n\u0002\n1\nN 2 < exp 4\u03c0\n\u03ba \u01eb \u2212 e . Approximating \u01eb by its value at infinity, we find\nI\u2243\n\n4\u03c0\nexp\nmH m2W\n\n\u0012\n\nN < e8.9/\u03ba .\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n(4.3)\n\n\fTherefore, when one takes into account the propagation of the heavy Higgs boson, the\nnecessary condition for the convergence of the cumulant expansion is that the number of\ncolors may grow not arbitrarily fast, but should rather be bounded from above by some\nparameter, which is nevertheless exponentially large. A similar analysis can be performed\nin the BPS limit, mH \u226a g2 . There, one readily finds I \u2243 (gm /mH )2 , and\n\u0014\n\n4\u03c0\n\u03beIN \u221d N exp \u2212\n\u03ba\n2\n\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u01eb\u2212\n2\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n.\n\nApproximating \u01eb by its value at the origin, we see that the upper bound for N in this limit\nis smaller than in the vicinity of the compact-QED limit and reads\nN < e\u03c0/\u03ba .\n\n(4.4)\n\nNote that both constraints (4.3) and (4.4) are more severe, in the respective limits, than\nthe constraint (3.10). Indeed, at mH \u223c mW , eq. (3.10) reads [with the same accuracy as\n\u0001\n\u0001\neq. (4.3)] N . O e11.2/\u03ba , and in the BPS limit it obviously takes the form N . O e2\u03c0/\u03ba .\nUpon the expansion of cosines in eq. (4.1), one can see that the action (3.9) becomes\nreplaced by\nZ\n\nm2\n1\n(\u2202\u03bc \u03c7\n~ )2 +\nd x\n2\n2\n3\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0012\n\n2\ngm\n(1 + 3\u03beIN (N + 1)) \u03c7\n~4\n\u03c7\n~ \u2212\n12(N + 1)\n2\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n.\n\nFollowing further the same steps which led from eq. (3.9) to eq. (3.15), we arrive at the\nfollowing correction to the latter:\n\u001a\n\n\u0015\u001b\n\u0014\n(k \u2212 1)(N \u2212 k \u2212 1)\n1\nR(k, N ) + \u2206R(k, N ) = C(k, N ) 1 + \u03b1\n+ 3\u03beI\n.\n2\nN (N + 1)\n\n(4.5)\n\nThe obtained correction is therefore exponentially small as long as the parameter of the\ncumulant expansion is.\nAnother correction to eq. (1.1) is produced by closed k-strings. Such strings are always\npresent in the sector of a theory, where open k-strings are present (see e.g. ref. [26]).\nOwing to the above-established fact that the open-string tension is saturated by such\nconfigurations where all k weight vectors are mutually different, we may restrict ourselves\nto consideration of closed strings of the same kind only. Then, according to eq. (3.2), the\nstatistical weight of the interaction of the dual photon with such a closed string reads\n\u0014\n\nexp ig (~\n\u03bca1 + * * * + ~\u03bcak )\nwhere \u03a3\u03bc (~x, \u03a3) \u2261\n\nR\n\n\u03a3\n\nZ\n\n3\n\n\u0015\n\nd x\u03a3\u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c7\n~ ,\n\n(4.6)\n\nd\u03c3\u03bc (~x(\u03be)) \u03b4 (~x \u2212 ~x(\u03be)) is the vorticity tensor current defined at the\n\nclosed-string world-sheet \u03a3. To model the grand canonical ensemble of closed strings, one\ncan proceed along the lines of ref. [27]. Namely, one can use the fact that these strings\nare short-living (virtual) objects, whose typical sizes are much smaller than the typical distances between them; therefore, similarly to monopoles in the 3-d Georgi-Glashow model,\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fclosed strings form a dilute plasma. The vorticity tensor current of the N -string configN\nP\nuration, i.e. the N -string density, (N \u2265 1) reads 6 \u03a3N\nni \u03a3\u03bc (~x, \u03a3i ), where ni 's are\n\u03bc =\ni=1\n\nwinding numbers. Similarly to monopoles, only strings with minimal winding numbers,\nni = \u00b11, survive, whereas those with |ni | > 1 dissociate into them. The summation over\nthe grand canonical ensemble of closed strings replaces then eq. (4.6) by\n\u0014\n\u0015\u001d\nZ\n\u221e\nN Z\nX\nX \u001c\n\u03b6\u0304 N Y\n3\n3\nN\nd yi\nexp ig (~\u03bca1 + * * * + ~\u03bcak ) d x\u03a3\u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c7\n~\n.\nN!\n~\nzi (\u03be)\nn =\u00b11\n\nN =0\n\ni=0\n\n(4.7)\n\ni\n\nHere, \u03b6\u0304 is the fugacity of a single closed string, which has the dimensionality [mass]3 , and\nis an exponentially small quantity in the sense that the mean distance between neighbors\n\u0001\nin the string plasma, O \u03b6\u0304 \u22121/3 , is exponentially large with respect to the characteristic\nstring size. Also, in eq. (4.7), the world-sheet coordinate of the i-th strings has been\nR\nsplit as ~xi (\u03be) = ~\nyi + ~zi (\u03be), where the vector ~yi = d2 \u03be~xi (\u03be) describes the position of the\nstring, whereas the vector ~zi (\u03be) describes its shape. Furthermore, the translation- and O(3)\ninvariant measure of integration over string shapes has been denoted as h. . .i~zi (\u03be) . The final\nexpression for the average does not depend on a particular form of this measure. (The only\nthing which matters is the normalization h1i~zi (\u03be) = 1.) The result of the average rather\ndoes depend on the choice of the UV cutoff, which in the theory under study is, however,\nunambiguous: \u039b = mW .\nEquation (4.7) produces then the following factor to the r.h.s. of eq. (3.1):\n\u0015\u001b\n\u001a Z\n\u0014\ng (~\n\u03bca1 + * * * + ~\u03bcak ) |\u2202\u03bc \u03c7\n~|\n3\n,\n(4.8)\nexp 2\u03b6\u0304 d x cos\nm2W\nR\nwhere d3 x is nothing else, but the integration over the string position. Also, in eq. (4.8),\nthe absolute value is taken with respect to the Lorentz indices only 7 . In the case of a dilute\nstring plasma under study, we may approximate the cosine in eq. (4.8) by the quadratic\nterm only, that yields the following addendum to the action (3.4):\n\u03b6\u0304\n\u03ba\nm3W\n\nZ\n\nd3 x [(~\u03bca1 + * * * + ~\u03bcak ) \u2202\u03bc \u03c7\n~ ]2 .\n\nTo evaluate with respect to this modified action the average (3.3) (approximated again\nby a single term where all weight vectors are mutually different), we solve the respective\nsaddle-point equation with the natural Ansatz \u03c7\n~ = (~\u03bca1 + * * * + ~\u03bcak ) \u03c7.

(This shift can be interpreted as an\n\"antiscreening\" of the dual photon by closed strings, which carry an electric flux and\ntherefore diminish the effect of screening by magnetic monopoles.) \u0010The string\n\u0011 tension\n3\u03b2\naccordingly reads [cf. the Casimir-scaling expression \u03c3k = C \u03c3\u0304] \u03c3k = C 1 \u2212 2 \u03c3\u0304, so that\neq. (1.1) becomes modified as follows:\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n3\u03ba \u03b6\u0304 (k \u2212 1)(N \u2212 k \u2212 1)\nR(k, N ) + \u2206R(k, N ) = C(k, N ) 1 \u2212\n.\n2 m3W\nN\n\n(4.9)\n\nAlthough the numerator of the obtained correction is the same as that of eq. (3.15), the\ndenominator is obviously different in the factor (N + 1). Consequently, although the\n\u0001\ncorrection due to closed strings is small in the factor O \u03ba\u03b6\u0304/m3W , at k \u223c N it scales\n\u0001\n\u0001\nas O N 1 , rather than O N 0 , as the correction in eq. (3.15) does. Besides the N dependence, the obtained correction differs from that of eq.\u0010 (3.15)\n\u0011 by its sign. However,\nm3\n\n, when this could have\neq. (4.9) never becomes negative. Indeed, at k \u223c N & O \u03baW\n\u03b6\u0304\nhappened, the parameter \u03b2 becomes of the order of unity, i.e. the original approximation\n\u03b2 \u226a 1, under which eq. (4.9) has been derived, breaks down. Therefore, at such values of\nk and N , eq. (4.9) becomes merely invalid.\n\n5. Summary and discussion\nIn the present paper, we have explored k-string tensions in the SU(N ) 3-d Georgi-Glashow\nmodel. The advantage of this model for such an analysis is that confinement holds in it at\nweak coupling and is therefore under a full analytic control. We have first addressed the\ncase of a very dilute monopole plasma and found there the Casimir-scaling behavior for the\nk-string tension. After that, we have proceeded with the leading non-diluteness correction\nand found that, at k \u226a N it behaves as O(1/N ), whereas at k \u223c N this correction is of the\norder of the leading term. The latter fact means that, in the regime k \u223c N \u226b 1, the nondiluteness effects can significantly change the Casimir-scaling behavior. The non-diluteness\ncorrection increases the value of the ratio of string tensions.\nWe have further addressed two other corrections to the Casimir scaling. One of these\nis produced by the Higgs-mediated interaction of monopoles, while the other is due to\nclosed k-strings. The Higgs-inspired effect appears as an addendum to the non-diluteness\ncorrection and has the same sign as that correction (i.e., increases the ratio of string\ntensions). However, the effect of the Higgs field is small with respect to the non-diluteness\ncorrection, as long as the cumulant expansion, one applies for the average over the Higgs\nfield, is convergent. On the opposite, the correction to the Casimir scaling, produced by\nclosed strings, becomes significant at k \u223c N \u226b 1. Contrary to the non-diluteness and\nHiggs effects, this correction diminishes the value of the Casimir-scaling ratio.\nTo conclude, notice that the obtained leading Casimir-scaling behavior may, with a\ncertain care, be translated to the SU(N )-analogue of 4-d compact QED. Obviously, this\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fmodel can only be viewed as a continuum limit of the respective lattice action [15]. Its\ncrucial difference from the above-discussed 3-d counterpart is that, in this model, confinement holds at strong (rather than weak, as in 3-d) coupling, and instead of the dilute\nplasma of point-like monopoles one has a non-dilute ensemble of proliferating monopole\nloops (currents). However, as we have argued in section 3, the non-diluteness corrections\nto the quadratic dual-photon action are small, provided N is bounded from above by some\nexponentially large parameter and we will exploit this fact below. One may, nevertheless, take non-diluteness into account by noting that it changes the interaction between\nmonopoles from Coulombic (as in 3-d) to a different type, described by some unknown\nkernel. On general grounds, one should accept that momenta, transferred by the dual photon in the interactions between monopoles, are conserved. Therefore, the above-mentioned\nkernel should be translation-invariant, i.e. the interaction of two N -monopole currents 8 ,\nN\nH\nP\n~j\u03bcN (x) = gm\n~qia dxa\u03bc (\u03c4 )\u03b4 (x \u2212 xa (\u03c4 )), should have the form ~j\u03bcN (x)K(x \u2212 y)~j\u03bcN (y).\na=1\n\nFurther, to sum over the grand canonical ensemble of monopoles, let us proceed in the\nsame way as we did for closed strings in the preceeding section. Namely, let us split xa\u03bc (\u03c4 )\nR1\nas xa\u03bc (\u03c4 ) = y\u03bca + z\u03bca (\u03c4 ), where y\u03bca = d\u03c4 xa\u03bc (\u03c4 ) is the position of the monopole trajectory,\n0\n\nwhereas the vector z\u03bca (\u03c4 ) describes its shape. Let us also introduce the fugacity of a singlemonopole loop, \u03b6, which has the dimensionality [mass]4 , \u03b6 \u221d e\u2212Smon . Here, the action of\nR1 q \u00012\n2\na single a-th loop, obeying the estimate Smon \u221d gm d\u03c4\n\u017c\u03bca , is assumed to be of the\n0\n\nsame order of magnitude for all loops. The summation over the grand canonical ensemble\nthen reads:\nN Z\n\u221e\nX\n\u03b6N Y\nd4 ya\nN ! a=1\n\nN =0\n\n\uf8ee\n\n= exp \uf8f02\u03b6\n\nX\n\nia =\u00b11,...,\u00b1 N(N\u22121)\n2\n\nN (N \u22121)/2 Z\n\nX\ni=1\n\n\u001c\n\u0012\n\u0013\u001d\nI\na\nexp igm ~qia dz\u03bc \u03c7\n~ \u03bc (xa )\n=\n\n\uf8f9\n\u0013\u001d\n\u001c\n\u0012\nI\n~ \u03bc (y + z) \uf8fb =\nd4 y cos gm ~qi dz\u03bc \u03c7\n\n\uf8f1\n#+2k \uf8fc\n\"I\n*\n\u22121)/2 Z\n\u221e\n\u221e\ny n\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f2 N (NX\nk\nX\nX\n(z\u03bd \u2202\u03bd )\n(\u22121)\n\u03c7\n~ \u03bc (y)\ngm ~qi\ndz\u03bc\n,\n= exp 2\u03b6\nd4 y\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f3\n2k!\nn!\ni=1\n\n(5.1)\n\nn=0\n\nk=1\n\nwhere \u03c7\n~ \u03bc is the dual-photon field, and h* * * i denotes some rotation- and translation\b\ninvariant average over shapes of the loops, z\u03bca . The term in the action with k = 1,\nn = 0 generates the Debye mass of the dual photon. Indeed, this term yields\n2\nN gm\n2\u03b6 *\n*\n2\n2\n\n\u001cI\n\ndz\u03bc\n\nI\n\ndz\u03bd\u2032\n\n8\n\n\u001dZ\n\nd4 y~\n\u03c7\u03bc (y)~\n\u03c7\u03bd (y),\n\nThe magnetic coupling constant, gm , is obviously dimensionless in four dimensions. Note also that we\nset by definition ~j\u03bcN =0 (x) = 0.\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\fand, due to the rotation and translation invariance of the measure h. . .i, the average\nH\nH\ndz\u03bc dz\u03bd\u2032 has the form L\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd , where L is some parameter of dimensionality [length]2 .\n\u221a\nThe Debye mass then reads m = gm 2N \u03b6L. In the leading low-energy approximation, we\nmay disregard terms with n \u2265 1 in the sum (5.1). As for the terms with k \u2265 2 (which\naccount for non-diluteness), as it has been discussed above, they are small and can be\ndisregarded at [cf. eq. (3.10)]\n\u0011\n\u0010\nN . O eSmon /2 .\n\n(5.2)\n\nTherefore, the leading part of the dual-photon action reads\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\nd4 x~\n\u03c7\u03bc K \u22121 (x) + m2 \u03c7\n~ \u03bc,\n2\n\nwhere K \u22121 stands for the inverse operator. This action is the 4-d analogue of the action (3.4), while, as it has already been discussed, the rest of the derivation of eq. (3.8)\nis entirely based on the properties of weights of the fundamental representation. 9 Therefore, at N bounded from above according to the inequality (5.2), one obtains the Casimir\nscaling also within the leading low-energy approximation to the SU(N )-analogue of fourdimensional compact QED.\n\nAcknowledgments\nD.A. is grateful to the whole staff of the Physics Department of the University of Pisa\nfor cordial hospitality and to INFN for the financial support.

In the general case, i.e. unless\nK is adjusted in such a way that at small p2 , K\u0303 \u22121 (p) = \u2212m2 + . . ., this indeed holds true.\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\f[9] B. Lucini and M.
