INTRODUCTION\nII. MODEL AND METHOD\n\nRecently the superconductivity of organic substances\ndue to injection of charges by electric field in the field\neffect transistor (FET) was found [1\u20133]. This new physical phenomenon is considered to be unusual in several\naspects. First, unusual is the nature of the superconducting objects themselves: they are organic crystals,\nanthracene, phenanthrene and fullerene C60 . Second, unusual is the superconductivity of the charges injected by\nelectric field: up-to-date the superconductivity of organic\ncrystals was related to the charge transfer, particularly,\ndue to chemical doping. Third, in the case of fullerene\nC60 the superconductivity is observed at extremely high\ntemperature (52 K for pure C60 [1] and at even 117 K\nwhen doping by bromoform [3]). Fourth, injecting holes\ninto the fullerene leads to significantly higher critical temperature than at injecting electrons, although at chemical\ndoping the C60 superconductivity is observed with negative charge carriers only.\nThese findings give rise to the problem of physical\nmechanisms of the phenomena, in the first turn, including the question on the distribution of charge carriers\nin organic crystal. In the study [1] the amount of induced charges per C60 molecule is estimated with the\nsupposition that the additional charges occupy the surface monolayer only.\nAn almost complete surface localization of induced\ncharges near superconducting concentration is predicted\nin [4]. This study makes use of tight-binding model taking into account electron repulsion by mean field. However, in the case of fullerite, the Hubbard repulsion U0\non a C60 molecule is estimated to be 1 eV or more [5]\nwhereas the magnitude of the interfullerene hopping t\n\nAs in Ref. [4], we consider the fcc fullerite lattice with\na (001) plane parallel to the gate. We are interesting\nin the distribution of injected charges between the (001)\nparallel layers of C60 molecules that forms square lattices\nwith the side length b=10 A.\nLet \u03c1n be total number of extra electrons per molecule\nin layer n, so their charge is \u2212e\u03c1n (the case of injected\nholes is represented by negative \u03c1n ). We consider the\nsystem with the total numbers of layers N +1, the surface\nlayer is labeled by zero.\nThe basic assumption of our model is neglecting the\noverlap between C60 molecules. Accordingly, the total\nenergy of the crystal is the sum of the energies of the separate layers of molecules that interact electrostatically.\nThe energy En per molecule in a layer n with the potential Un is\nEn =\n\nN\nX\n\n[E0 (\u03c1n ) \u2212 eUn \u03c1n ],\n\n(1)\n\nn=0\n\nwhere E0 (\u03c1n ) is energy of free molecule with \u03c1n extra\nelectrons.\nThis expression is accurate provided \u03c1n is integer, so\nE0 (\u03c1n ) can be treated as energies of C60 ions with corresponding charges. For noninteger \u03c1n , it is naturally assumed that E0 (\u03c1n ) can be interpolated by the quadratic\nfit,\n1\nE0 (\u03c1n ) = E0 (0) + E1 \u03c1n + E2 \u03c12n .\n2\n\n1\n\n(2)\n\n\fX+ AX = \u01eb, X+ X = I,\n\nThen the minimum condition of total energy with respect\nto \u03c1n leads to equation\nE1 + E2 \u03c1n \u2212 eUn = \u03b8,\n\nwhere X is square matrix the column of which are eigenvectors of A and \u01eb is diagonal matrix of corresponding\neigevalues. Then one can obtain from (9) and (11)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is a Lagrange multiplier taking into account the\nadditional restriction of fixing total electron number\nX\n\u03c1n = \u03c1tot .\n(4)\n\n\u03c1\n~ = CX(\u01eb + \u03bbI)\u22121 X+ V.\n\nFrom the other side, the layer potentials are, in turn,\nrelated to the charges by the Poisson equations. Because\nof negligible hopping, as it is adopted in our model, the\nC60 molecules interact only electrostatically and can be\nrepresented by point charges due to their near spherical\nform. According to Ref. [4], the potential Un of layer n\nis determined by the equation\nN\nX\n\nm=0\n\nmin(m, n)\u03c1m \u2212 \u03b7\u03c1n ,\n\nIII. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe quantity 1\u2212\u03c1n /\u03c1tot determines the relative part of\ninjected charge below the surface layer of the crystal. Its\ndependence on the parameter E2 is depicted in Fig.1, as\nthe result of calculations with N =50. We consider only\nrange E2 > \u03b7 where the solutions have physical meaning\nand all the \u03c1n has the same sign as the constant C in (12).\nThe Fig.1 shows that the charge density at (E2 \u2212\u03b7) \u2192 +0\nis completely localized on the surface molecules. As E2\nrises, the charges markedly expands into deeper layers.\nTo obtain numerical estimations in real C60 crystal one\nshould evaluate only E2 in the approximation (2). Considering the latter as a fit to the ground-state energies\nof C60 molecule and its ions one obtains the following\nestimations of E2 for injected charges of both signs\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the coefficients \u03be and \u03b7 are expressed through C60\ndielectric constant \u03b5 and the distance b between neighboring molecules\n\u03be=\n\n4\u03c0e2\n\u221a ,\n\u03b5b 2\n\n\u03b7=\n\n3.9e2\n.\n\u03b5b\n\n(6)\n\nExcluding Un from (3) and (5) one obtains the system of\nlinear inhomogeneous equations that determine, together\nwith the condition (4), the charge densities \u03c1n ,\n\u03bb\u03c1n +\n\nn\nX\n\nm=0\n\nm\u03c1m + n\n\nN\nX\n\nE2 = E(0) + E(2) \u2212 2E(1)\n\u2212\n= A(C60 ) \u2212 A(C60\n) = 2.7eV, (for electrons)\nE2 = E(0) + E(\u22122) \u2212 2E(\u22121)\n+\n= \u2212I(C60 ) + I(C60\n) = 3.8eV, (for holes)\n\n\u03c1n = C, n = 0, 1 . . . , N, (7)\n\nm=n+1\n\nwhere parameter \u03bb is defined by the equality\n\u03bb = (E2 \u2212 \u03b7)/\u03be\n\nwhere A are electron affinities and I are ionization potentials with known experimental values (in eV) [7\u20139]:\n\n(8)\n\nA(C60 ) = 2.7, A(C\u2212\n60 ) \u2248 0,\n+\nI(C60 ) = 7.6, I(C60 ) = 19.0 \u2212 7.6 = 11.4.\n\nand C = (\u03b8 \u2212 E1 )/\u03be is a new constant. As it can be seen\nfrom Eq.(7) at n = 0, this constant is in close relationship\nto the charge density in surface layer, C = \u03bb\u03c10 .\nTo treat the system (7), let us write it in the matrix\nform\n(A + \u03bbI)~\n\u03c1 = CV,\n\n(12)\n\nEq.(12) shows that the shape of charge profile defined\nby the relative charge distribution, is independent on \u03c1tot .\nObtaining \u03c1n at any C, they are normalized to \u03c1tot , thus\nsatisfying the additional condition (4).\n\nn\n\n\u2212 eUn = \u03be\n\n(11)\n\nUsing the estimation\n\u221a of parameter \u03be in (6) \u03be = 2.9 eV [4],\nwe obtain \u03b7 = 3.9\u03be 2/4\u03c0 =1.27 eV. With above estimations of E2 the degree of charge delocalization 1 \u2212 \u03c1n /\u03c1tot\nis evaluated as 0.266 for electrons and 0.359 for holes, as it\nis illustrated in Fig.1. In other words, about one quarter\nof injected electron charge and one third of hole charges\nturns out to be beneath the surface layer of C60 crystal.\nThe calculated charge distributions between the layers\nfor electrons and holes in the N = 50 crystal is shown\nin Fig.2. It is clear that the injected charge densities fall\nwith the distance from the surface strictly exponentialy\nin both cases, with the electron density dropping more\nrapidly than hole one.\nTo conclude, we summarize the main differences of our\nresults from obtained in Ref. [4]. (i) The charge profile\nin [4] substantially depends on the charge concentration\n\n(9)\n\nwhere I is unit matrix, V is the column vector all the\ncomponents of which are units, and A is (N +1)\u00d7(N +1)\nmatrix of form\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0 0 0 0 *\n\uf8ec0 1 1 1 *\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n(10)\nA = \uf8ec 0 1 2 2 * \uf8f7.\n\uf8ed0 1 2 3 *\uf8f8\n* * * * *\nTo find \u03c1n , let us solve the eigenvalue problem of the\nmatrix A,\n2\n\n\fwhereas our relative distribution is independent of it. (ii)\nAccording to [4] 98 % of the total charge is confined to\nthe surface layer for doping \u03c1tot higher than 0.3, in opposite to our calculations showing this degree less than\n75 % at any doping. The both results are in qualitative\nagreement with respect to domination of injected charges\nin the top layer. At the same time, our calculations show\nthe possible nonnegligible occupation of undersurface layers. The question on their role in the conductivity properties of fullerite in FET structures needs in a separate\nconsideration in future. However, just now our results\nsuggest that the existing estimations of charge concentration providing the highest Tc in superconductive FET\nstructures may be subject to refinement.\n\n[1] J.H.
