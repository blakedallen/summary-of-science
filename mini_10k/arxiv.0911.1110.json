This\nconjecture holds in dimension at most 3.\n\nIntroduction\nThe main result of the paper consists in a birational characterization of normal affine\nalgebraic varieties with trivial Makar-Limanov invariant. Let us introduce the necessary\nnotation and definitions.\nWe let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0, M be a lattice of rank n, and\nT = Spec k[M ] \u2243 (k\u2217 )n be the algebraic torus over k. A T-variety X is a variety endowed\nwith an algebraic action of T. For an affine variety X = Spec A, introducing a T-action\non X is the same as to equipe A with an M -grading. There are well known combinatorial\ndescriptions of normal T-varieties. We send the reader to [Dem70] and [KKMS73, Ch. 1] for\nthe case of toric varieties, to [KKMS73, Ch. 2 and 4] and [Tim08] for the complexity 1 case\ni.e., dim X = dim T + 1, and to [AH06, AHS08] for the general case.\nWe let N = Hom(M, Z), and NQ = N \u2297 Q. Any affine toric variety can be described\nvia a polyhedral cone \u03c3 \u2286 NQ . Similarly, the description of normal affine T-varieties due to\nAltmann and Hausen [AH06] deals with a polyhedral cone \u03c3 \u2286 NQ , a normal variety Y , and\na divisor D on Y whose coefficients are polyhedra in NQ invariant by translation in \u03c3.\nTo introduce a Ga -action on an affine variety X is equivalent to fix a locally nilpotent\nderivation (LND) on its structure ring A [Fre06, \u00a71.5]. Any LND on A can be extended to a\nderivation on K = Frac A by the Leibniz rule. If an LND of A is homogeneous with respect\nto the M -grading on A we say that the associated Ga -action on X is compatible with the\nT-action. Furthermore, we say that a homogeneous LND \u2202 (or, equivalently, the associated\nGa -action) is of fiber type if \u2202(K T ) = 0 and of horizontal type otherwise [FZ05, Lie08].\nIn [FZ05] Flenner and Zaidenberg gave a classification of compatible Ga -actions on normal\naffine k\u2217 -surfaces. Generalizing this construction, in [Lie08] a classification of Ga -actions on\nnormal affine T-varieties of complexity 1 was given. In Theorem 2.4 below, we extend this\nclassification to Ga -actions of fiber type on normal affine T-varieties of arbitrary complexity.\nThe Makar-Limanov (ML) invariant [KML97] showed to be an important tool for affine\ngeometry. In particular, it allows to distinguish certain varieties from the affine space. For\nan algebra A, this invariant is defined as the intersection of the kernels of all locally nilpotent\nderivations on A. Nevertheless, this invariant is far form being optimal. Indeed, many nonrational varieties share the same ML invariant as that of the affine space [Lie08]. The latter\nDate: June 3, 2018.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: 14R05, 14R20, 14J50.\nKey words: Torus action, Ga -action, locally nilpotent derivations, affine varieties, Makar-Limanov invariant.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nALVARO LIENDO\n\ninvariant is trivial i.e., ML(An ) = k. In Theorem 4.1 we give a birational characterization of\nnormal affine varieties with trivial ML invariant.\nTo avoid such a pathology, we introduce the FML invariant which is defined as as the\nintersection of the fields of fractions of the kernel of all locally nilpotent derivations on A.\nFor an affine variety X, we conjecture that FML(X) = k implies that X is rational. In\nTheorem 5.6 we prove this conjecture in dimension at most 3.\nThe content of the paper is as follows. In Section 1 we recall some generalities on T-actions\nand Ga -actions. In Section 2 we obtain our classification of LNDs of fiber type. In Section 3\nwe introduce the homogeneous ML invariant and show some of its limitations. In Section 4 we\nestablish our principal result concerning the birational characterization. Finally, in Section 5\nwe introduce and study the FML invariant.\nIn the entire paper k is an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0, except in Section\n1.3, where k can be non algebraically closed.\nThe author is grateful to Mikhail Zaidenberg for posing the problem and permanent encouragement, and to Pierre-Marie Poloni for useful discussions.\n1. Preliminaries\n1.1. Combinatorial description of T-varieties. Let N be a lattice of rank n and M =\nHom(N, Z) be its dual lattice. We also let NQ = N \u2297 Q, MQ = M \u2297 Q, and we consider the\nnatural duality pairing MQ \u00d7 NQ \u2192 Q, (m, p) 7\u2192 hm, pi.\nLet T = Spec k[M ] be the n-dimensional algebraic torus associated to M and let X =\nSpec A be an affine T-variety. It is well known that the comorphism A \u2192 A \u2297 k[M ] induces\nan M -grading on A and, conversely, every M -grading on A arises in this way. Furthermore,\na T-action is effective if an only if the corresponding M -grading is effective.\nIn [AH06], a combinatorial description of affine T-varieties is given. In what follows we\nrecall the main features of this description. Let \u03c3 be a pointed polyhedral cone in NQ .\nWe define Pol\u03c3 (NQ ) to be the set of all polyhedra in NQ which can be decomposed as the\nMinkowski sum of a compact polyhedron and \u03c3.\nTo any polyhedron \u2206 \u2208 Pol\u03c3 (NQ ) we associate its support function h\u2206 : \u03c3 \u2228 \u2192 Q defined\nby h\u2206 (m) = minhm, \u2206i. Clearly the support function h\u2206 is piecewise linear. Furthermore,\nh\u2206 is concave and positively homogeneous, i.e.\nh\u2206 (m + m\u2032 ) \u2265 h\u2206 (m) + h\u2206 (m\u2032 ), and h\u2206 (\u03bbm) = \u03bbh\u2206 (m), \u2200m, m\u2032 \u2208 \u03c3 \u2228 , \u2200\u03bb \u2208 Q\u22650 .\nDefinition 1.1. A variety Y is called semiprojectiveP\nif it is projective over an affine variety.\nA \u03c3-polyhedral divisor on Y is a formal sum D = H \u2206H * H, where H runs over prime\ndivisors on Y , \u2206H \u2208 Pol\u03c3 (NQ ), and \u2206H = \u03c3 for all but finitely many values of H. For\nm \u2208 \u03c3 \u2228 we can evaluate D in m by letting D(m) be the Q-divisor\nX\nD(m) =\nhH (m) * H .\nH\u2208Y\n\nwhere hH = h\u2206H . A \u03c3-polyhedral divisor D is called proper if the following hold\n\u2228 , and\n(i) D(m) is semiample1 and Q-Cartier for all m \u2208 \u03c3M\n\u2228\n(ii) D(m) is big for all m \u2208 rel. int(\u03c3 ).\n\nThe following theorem gives a combinatorial description of T-varieties analogous to the\nclassical combinatorial description of toric varieties.\nTheorem 1.2 ([AH06]). To any proper \u03c3-polyhedral divisor D on a semiprojective variety\nY one can associate a normal finitely generated effectively M -graded domain of dimension\n1Recall that a divisor D is semiample if O (rD) is globally generated for some r > 0.\nY\n\n\fGa -ACTIONS OF FIBER TYPE ON AFFINE T-VARIETIES\n\nrank M + dim Y given by2\nM\nAm \u03c7m ,\nA[Y, D] =\n\nwhere\n\n3\n\nAm = H 0 (Y, OY (D(m)) \u2286 K(Y ) .\n\n\u2228\nm\u2208\u03c3M\n\nConversely, any normal finitely generated effectively M -graded domain is isomorphic to\nA[Y, D] for some semiprojective variety Y and some proper \u03c3-polyhedral divisor D on Y .\n1.2. Locally nilpotent derivations and Ga -actions. Let X = Spec A be an affine variety.\nA derivation on A is called locally nilpotent (LND for short) if for every a \u2208 A there exists\nn \u2208 Z\u22650 such that \u2202 n (a) = 0. Given an LND \u2202 on A, the map \u03c6\u2202 : Ga \u00d7 A \u2192 A, \u03c6\u2202 (t, f ) =\net\u2202 f defines a Ga -action on X, and any Ga -action arises in this way.\nIn the following lemma we collect some well known facts about LNDs over a field of\ncharacteristic 0 (not necessarily algebraically closed), see e.g., [Fre06].\nLemma 1.3. Let A be a finitely generated normal domain over a field of characteristic 0.\nFor any two LNDs \u2202 and \u2202 \u2032 on A, the following hold.\n(i) ker \u2202 is a normal subdomain of codimension 1.\n(ii) ker \u2202 is factorially closed i.e., ab \u2208 ker \u2202 \u21d2 a, b \u2208 ker \u2202.\n(iii) If a \u2208 A is invertible, then a \u2208 ker \u2202.\n(iv) If ker \u2202 = ker \u2202 \u2032 , then there exist a, a\u2032 \u2208 ker \u2202 such that a\u2202 = a\u2032 \u2202 \u2032 .\n(v) If a \u2208 ker \u2202, then a\u2202 is again an LND.\n(vi) If \u2202(a) \u2208 (a) for some a \u2208 A, then a \u2208 ker \u2202.\n(vii) The field extension Frac(ker \u2202) \u2286 Frac A is purely transcendental of degree 1.\nDefinition 1.4. We say that two LNDs \u2202 and \u2202 \u2032 on A are equivalent if ker \u2202 = ker \u2202 \u2032 .\nLet D be a proper \u03c3-polyhedral divisor on a semiprojective variety Y , and let A = A[Y, D]\nbe the corresponding M -graded domain. A derivation \u2202 on A is called homogeneous if it\nsends homogeneous elements into homogeneous elements. Given a homogeneous LND \u2202, we\ndefine its degree as deg \u2202 = deg \u2202(f ) \u2212 deg f for any homogeneous f \u2208 A \\ ker \u2202.\nLet KY = K(Y ). A homogeneous LND \u2202 on A extends to a derivation on Frac A = KY (M ),\nwhere KY (M ) is the field of fractions of KY [M ]. The LND \u2202 is said to be of fiber type if\n\u2202(KY ) = 0 and of horizontal type otherwise. Let X = Spec A. Geometrically speaking,\n\u2202 is of fiber type if and only if the general orbits of the corresponding Ga -action on X are\ncontained in the closures of general orbits of the T-action given by the M -grading.\n1.3. Locally nilpotent derivations on toric varieties. In this section we recall the classification of homogeneous LND given in [Lie08] for toric varieties defined over a field k of\ncharacteristic 0 (not necessarily algebraically closed).\nGiven dual bases {\u03bd1 , * * * , \u03bdn } and {\u03bc1 , * * * , \u03bcn } for N and M , respectively, we define the\npartial derivative \u2202\u03bdi with respect to \u03bdi as the homogeneous derivation on k[M ] given by\n\u2202\u03bdi (\u03c7\u03bcj ) = h\u03bcj , \u03bdi i = \u03b4ij .\nFor a pointed polyhedral cone \u03c3 in the vector space NQ , we let\nM\n\u2228\nk\u03c7m\nA = k[\u03c3M\n]=\n\u2228\nm\u2208\u03c3M\n\nbe the affine semigroup algebra of the corresponding affine toric variety X\u03c3 = Spec A.\nIf \u03c3 = {0}, then A is spanned by the characters which are invertible functions. By Lemma\n1.3 (iii) any LND on A is trivial. In the following, we fix a ray \u03c1 of \u03c3, and we let \u03c4 be the\ncodimension 1 face of \u03c3 \u2228 dual to \u03c1. Furthermore, letting \u03c10 \u2208 M be the primitive vector of\n\u03c1 we consider \u03bc \u2208 M such that h\u03bc, \u03c10 i = 1 and H = \u03c1\u22a5\n0 \u2286 MQ .\n2For a Q-divisor D, we let O (D) = O (\u230aD\u230b), where \u230aD\u230b is the integral part of D.\nY\nY\n\n\f4\n\nALVARO LIENDO\n\nDefinition 1.5. We define\nS\u03c1 = \u03c31\u2228 \u2229 (H \u2212 \u03bc) \u2229 M ,\nwhere \u03c31 is the cone spanned by the rays of \u03c3 except \u03c1. We have S\u03c1 6= \u2205. Furthermore,\ne + m \u2208 S\u03c1 whenever e \u2208 S\u03c1 and m \u2208 \u03c4M .\nThe following theorem gives a classification of the homogeneous LND of fiber type on A.\nTheorem 1.6. To any pair (\u03c1, e), where \u03c1 is a ray of \u03c3 and e \u2208 S\u03c1 , we can associate a\n\u2228 ] of degree e with kernel ker \u2202\nhomogeneous LND \u2202\u03c1,e on A = k[\u03c3M\n\u03c1,e = k[\u03c4M ]. Conversely, If\n\u2202 6= 0 is a homogeneous LND on A, then \u2202 = \u03bb\u2202\u03c1,e for some ray \u03c1 \u2286 \u03c3, some lattice vector\ne \u2208 S\u03c1 , and some \u03bb \u2208 k\u2217 .\nProof.

Let A be a normal finitely generated effectively M -graded domain, where M\nis a lattice of finite rank, and let \u2202 be a homogeneous LND on A. If \u2202 is of fiber type, then\nker \u2202 is finitely generated.\nProof. Let A = A[Y, D], where D is a proper \u03c3-polyhedral divisor on a semiprojective variety\nY . In the notation of Theorem 2.4 we have \u2202 = \u2202\u03c1,e,\u03c6 , where \u03c1 is a rayLof \u03c3. Letting \u03c4 \u2286 \u03c3 \u2228\nbe the codimension 1 face dual to \u03c1, by Theorem 2.4 we have ker \u2202 = m\u2208\u03c4M Am \u03c7m .\nLet a1 , . . . , ar be a set of homogeneous generators of A. Without loss of generality, we\nmay assume further that deg ai \u2208 \u03c4M if and only if 1 \u2264 i \u2264 s < r. We claim that a1 , . . . , as\n\u2228\ngenerate ker\nP \u2202. Indeed, let P be\u2228any polynomial such that P (a1 , . . . , ar ) \u2208 ker \u2202. Since \u03c4 \u2286 \u03c3\nis a face,\nmi \u2208 \u03c4M for mi \u2208 \u03c3M implies that mi \u2208 \u03c4 \u2200i. Hence all the monomials composing\nP (a1 , . . . , ar ) are monomials in a1 , . . . , as , proving the claim.\n\u0003\nCorollary 2.6. Let as before \u2202 be a homogeneous LND of fiber type on A = A[Y, D], and let\nf \u03c7m \u2208 A \\ ker \u2202 be a homogeneous element. Then \u2202 is completely determined by the image\ng\u03c7m+e := \u2202(f \u03c7m ) \u2208 Am+e \u03c7m+e .\nProof. By the previous theorem \u2202 = \u2202\u03c1,e,\u03c6 for some ray \u03c1, some e \u2208 S\u03c1 , and some \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6e ,\nwhere e = deg \u2202 and \u03c1 is uniquely determined by e, see Corollary 2.8 in [Lie08].\nIn the course of the proof of Lemma 2.4 it was shown that \u2202\u03c1,e,\u03c6 (f \u03c7m ) = m0 \u03c6f \u03c7m+e . Thus\n\u0003\n\u03c6 = mg0 f \u2208 K0 is also uniquely determined by our data.\nIt might happen that \u03a6\u2217e as above is empty. Given a ray \u03c1 \u2286 \u03c3, in the following lemma we\ngive a criterion for the existence of e \u2208 S\u03c1 such that \u03a6\u2217e is non-empty.\nTheorem 2.7. Let A = A[Y, D], and let \u03c1 \u2286 \u03c3 be the ray dual to a codimension one face\n\u03c4 \u2286 \u03c3 \u2228 . There exists e \u2208 S\u03c1 such that dim \u03a6e is positive if and only if the divisor D(m) is\nbig for all lattice vectors m \u2208 rel. int(\u03c4 ).\nProof. Assuming that D(m) is big for all lattice vector m \u2208 rel. int(\u03c4 ), we consider the linear\nmap\nX\nG : MQ \u2192 DivQ (Y ), m 7\u2192\ng1,H (m) * H ,\nH\n\nso that G(m) = D(m) for all m \u2208 \u03c4 and De = \u2212G(e) for all e \u2208 S\u03c1 . Choosing m \u2208\nrel. int(\u03c4 ) \u2229 (S\u03c1 + \u03bc) and r \u2208 Z>0 , we let j = m \u2212 1r * \u03bc. We consider the divisor\nG(j) = G(m) \u2212\n\n1\nr\n\n* G(\u03bc) = D(m) \u2212\n\n1\nr\n\n* G(\u03bc) .\n\nSince D(m) is big and the big cone is open in DivR (Y ) (see [Laz04, Def. 2.2.25]), by\nchoosing r big enough, we may assume that G(j) is big. Furthermore, possible increasing r,\nwe may assume that G(r * j) has a section. Now, r * j = r * m \u2212 \u03bc = (r \u2212 1) * m + (m \u2212 \u03bc).\nSince (r \u2212 1) * m \u2208 \u03c4M and m \u2212 \u03bc \u2208 S\u03c1 , we have r * j \u2208 S\u03c1 . Letting e = r * j \u2208 S\u03c1 we obtain\nDe = \u2212G(e) and so dim H 0 (Y, OY (\u2212De )) is positive.\nAssume now that there is m \u2208 rel. int(\u03c4 ) such that D(m) is not big. Since the set of big\ndivisors is and open and convex subset in DivR (Y ), the divisor D(m) is not big whatever is\nm \u2208 \u03c4 . We let B be the algebra\nM\nB=\nAm \u03c7m .\nm\u2208\u03c4M\n\nUnder our assumption dim B < n + k \u2212 1. Since dim A = n + k, by Lemma 1.3 (i) B cannot\nbe the kernel of an LND on A. The latter implies, by Theorem 2.4 that there is no e \u2208 S\u03c1\nsuch that dim \u03a6e is positive.\n\u0003\nFinally, we deduce the following corollary.\n\n\fGa -ACTIONS OF FIBER TYPE ON AFFINE T-VARIETIES\n\n7\n\nCorollary 2.8. Two homogeneous LNDs of fiber type \u2202 = \u2202\u03c1,e,\u03c6 and \u2202 \u2032 = \u2202\u03c1\u2032 ,e\u2032 ,\u03c6\u2032 on\nA = A[Y, D] are equivalent if and only if \u03c1 = \u03c1\u2032 . Furthermore, the equivalence classes of\nhomogeneous LNDs of fiber type on A are in one to one correspondence with the rays \u03c1 \u2286 \u03c3\nsuch that D(m) is big \u2200m \u2208 rel. int(\u03c4 ), where \u03c4 is the codimension 1 face dual to \u03c1.\nProof. The first assertion follows from the description of ker \u2202\u03c1,e,\u03c6 in Lemma 2.4. The second\nfollows from the first one due to Theorem 2.7.\n\u0003\n3. Homogeneous Makar Limanov invariant\nLet X = Spec A, where A is a finitely generated normal domain, and let LND(A) be the\nset of all LNDs on A. The Makar-Limanov invariant (ML invariant for short) of A (or of\nX = Spec A) is defined as\n\\\nML(A) =\nker \u2202 .\n\u2202\u2208LND(A)\n\nIn the case where A is effectively M -graded we let LNDh (A) be the set of all homogeneous\nLNDs on A and LNDfib (A) be the set of all homogeneous LNDs of fiber type on A. Following\n[Lie08], we define\n\\\n\\\nMLh (A) =\nker \u2202\nand\nMLfib (A) =\nker \u2202 .\n\u2202\u2208LNDh (A)\n\n\u2202\u2208LNDfib (A)\n\nClearly ML(A) \u2286 MLh (A) \u2286 MLfib (A).\nIn this section we provide examples showing that, in general, these inclusions are strict\nand so, the homogeneous LNDs are not enough to compute the ML invariant.\nExample 3.1. Let A = k[x, y] with the grading given by deg x = 0 and deg y = 1. In this\ncase, both partial derivatives \u2202x = \u2202/\u2202x and \u2202y = \u2202/\u2202y are homogeneous. Since ker \u2202x = k[y]\nand ker \u2202y = k[x] we have MLh = k. Furthermore, it is easy to see that there is only one\nequivalence class of LNDs of fiber type. A representative of this class is \u2202y (see Corollary\n2.8). This yields MLfib (A) = k[x]. Thus MLh (A) ( MLfib (A) in this case.\nExample 3.2. To provide an example where ML(A) ( MLh (A) we consider the KorasRussell threefold X = Spec A, where\nA = k[x, y, z, t]/(x + x2 y + z 2 + t3 ) .\nThe ML invariant was first introduced in [KML97] to prove that X 6\u2243 A3 . In fact ML(A) =\nk[x] while ML(A3 ) = k. In the recent paper [Dub09] Dubouloz shows that the cylinder over\nthe Koras-Russell threefold has trivial ML invariant i.e., ML(A[w]) = k, where w is a new\nvariable.\nLet A[w] be graded by deg A = 0 and deg w = 1, and let \u2202 be a homogeneous LND on\nA[w]. If e := deg \u2202 \u2264 \u22121 then \u2202(A) = 0 and by Lemma 1.3 (i) we have that ker \u2202 = A and\n\u2202 is equivalent to the partial derivative \u2202/\u2202w.\nIf e \u2265 0 then \u2202(w) = awe+1 , where a \u2208 A and so, by Lemma 1.3 (vi) w \u2208 ker \u2202. Furthermore, for any a \u2208 A we have \u2202(a) = bwe , for a unique b \u2208 A. We define a derivation\n \u0304\n\u2202 \u0304 : A \u2192 A by \u2202(a)\n= b. Since \u2202 r (a) = \u2202 \u0304r (a)wre the derivation \u2202 \u0304 is LND. This yields\nMLh (A[w]) = ML(A) = k[x] while ML(A[w]) = k.\n4. Birational equivalence classes of varieties with\ntrivial ML invariant\nIn this section we establish the following birational characterization of normal affine varieties with trivial ML invariant. Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0.\n\n\f8\n\nALVARO LIENDO\n\nTheorem 4.1. Let X = Spec A be an affine variety of dimension n \u2265 2 over k. If ML(X) =\nk then X \u2243bir Y \u00d7 P2 for some variety Y . Conversely, in any birational class Y \u00d7 P2 there\nis an affine variety X with ML(X) = k.\nProof. Let K = Frac A be the field of rational functions on X so that tr. degk (K) = n. As\nusual tr. degk (K) denotes the transcendence degree of the field extension k \u2286 K.\nSince ML(X) = k, there exists at least 2 non-equivalent LNDs \u22021 , \u22022 : A \u2192 A. We let\nLi = Frac(ker \u2202i ) \u2286 K, for i = 1, 2. By Lemma 1.3 (vii), Li \u2286 K is a purely transcendental\nextension of degree 1, for i = 1, 2.\nWe let L = L1 \u2229 L2 . By an inclusion-exclusion argument we have tr. degL (K) = 2. We let\n\u0100 be the 2-dimensional algebra over L\n\u0100 = A \u2297k L .\nSince Frac \u0100 = Frac A = K and L \u2286 ker \u2202i for i = 1, 2, the LND \u2202i extends to a locally\nnilpotent L-derivation \u2202 \u0304i by setting\n\u2202 \u0304i (a \u2297 l) = \u2202i (a) \u2297 l,\n\nwhere a \u2208 A, and l \u2208 L .\n\nFurthermore, ker \u2202 \u0304i = \u0100 \u2229 Li , for i = 1, 2 and so\nker \u2202 \u03041 \u2229 ker \u2202 \u03042 = \u0100 \u2229 L1 \u2229 L2 = L .\nThus the Makar-Limanov invariant of the 2-dimensional L-algebra \u0100 is trivial.\nBy the theorem in [ML, p. 41], \u0100 is isomorphic to an L-subalgebra of L[x1 , x2 ], where\nx1 , x2 are new variables. Thus\nK \u2243 L(x1 , x2 ),\n\nand so X \u2243bir Y \u00d7 P2 ,\n\nwhere Y is any variety with L as the field of rational functions.\nThe second assertion follows from Lemma 4.2 bellow. This completes the proof.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe following lemma provides examples of affine varieties with trivial ML invariant in any\nbirational class Y \u00d7 Pn , n \u2265 2. It is a generalization of Section 4.3 in [Lie08]. Let us introduce\nsome notation.\nAs before, we let N be a lattice of rank n \u2265 2 and M be its dual lattice. We let \u03c3 \u2286 NQ\nbe a pointed polyhedral cone of full dimension. We fix p \u2208 rel. int(\u03c3) \u2229 M . We let \u2206 = p + \u03c3\nand h = h\u2206 so that\nh(m) = hp, mi > 0, for all m \u2208 \u03c3 \u2228 \\ {0} .\nFurthermore, letting Y be a projective variety and H be a semiample and big Cartier\nZ-divisor on Y , we let A = A[Y, D], where D is the proper \u03c3-polyhedral divisor D = \u2206 * H,\nso that\nD(m) = hp, mi * H, for all m \u2208 \u03c3 \u2228 .\nRecall that Frac A = KY (M ) so that Spec A \u2243bir Y \u00d7 Pn .\nLemma 4.2. With the above notation, the affine variety X = Spec A[Y, D] has trivial ML\ninvariant.\nProof. Let {\u03c1i }i be the set of all rays of \u03c3 and {\u03c4i }i the set of the corresponding dual\ncodimension 1 faces of \u03c3 \u2228 . Since rH is big for all r > 0, Theorem 2.7 shows that there exists\nei \u2208 S\u03c1i such that dim \u03a6ei is positive, and so we can chose a non-zero \u03c6i \u2208 \u03a6ei .

By Theorem 2.9 in [Lie09] X has rational singularities if and only if\nOY and OY (H) are acyclic. The latter assumption can be fulfilled by taking, for instance, Y\ntoric or Y a rational surface, and H a large enough multiple of an ample divisor.\n5. FML invariant\nThe main application of the ML invariant is to distinguish some varieties from the affine\nspace. Nevertheless, this invariant is far from being optimal as we have seen in the previous\nsection. Indeed, there is a large class of non-rational normal affine varieties with trivial ML\ninvariant. To eliminate such a pathology, we propose below a generalization of the classical\nML invariant.\nLet A be a finitely generated normal domain. We define the FML invariant of A as the\nsubfield of K = Frac A given by\n\\\nFML(A) =\nFrac(ker \u2202) .\n\u2202\u2208LND(A)\n\nIn the case where A is M -graded we define FMLh and FMLfib in the analogous way.\nRemark 5.1. Let A = k[x1 , * * * , xn ] so that K = k(x1 , * * * , xn ). For the partial derivative\n\u2202i = \u2202/\u2202xi we have Frac(ker \u2202i ) = k(x1 , * * * , xbi , * * * , xn ), where xbi means that xi is omitted.\nThis yields\nn\n\\\nFrac(ker \u2202i ) = k ,\nFML(A) \u2286\ni=1\n\nand so FML(A) = k. Thus, the FML invariant of the affine space is trivial.\n\nFor any finitely generated normal domain A there is an inclusion ML(A) \u2286 FML(A). A\npriori, since FML(An ) = k the FML invariant is stronger than the classical one in the sense\nthat it can distinguish more varieties form the affine space that the classical one. In the\nnext proposition we show that the classical ML invariant can be recovered from the FML\ninvariant.\nProposition 5.2. Let A be a finitely generated normal domain, then\nML(A) = FML(A) \u2229 A .\nProof. We must show that for any LND \u2202 on A,\nker \u2202 = Frac(ker \u2202) \u2229 A .\nThe inclusion \"\u2286\" is trivial. To prove the converse inclusion, we fix a \u2208 Frac(ker \u2202) \u2229 A.\nLetting b, c \u2208 ker \u2202 be such that ac = b, Lemma 1.3 (ii) shows that a \u2208 ker \u2202.\n\u0003\nLet A = A[Y, D] for some proper \u03c3-polyhedral divisor D on a normal semiprojective variety\nY . In this case K = Frac A = KY (M ), where KY (M ) corresponds to the field of fractions\nof the semigroup algebra KY [M ]. It is a purely transcendental extension of KY of degree\nrank M .\nLet \u2202 be a homogeneous LND of fiber type on A. By definition, KY \u2286 Frac(ker \u2202) and so,\nKY \u2286 FMLfib (A). This shows that the pathological examples as in Lemma 4.2 cannot occur.\nLet us formulate the following conjecture.\nConjecture 5.3. Let X be an affine variety. If FML(X) = k then X is rational.\n\n\fGa -ACTIONS OF FIBER TYPE ON AFFINE T-VARIETIES\n\n11\n\nThe following lemma proves Conjecture 5.3 in the particular case where X \u2243bir C \u00d7 Pn ,\nwith C a curve.\nLemma 5.4. Let X = Spec A be an affine variety such that X \u2243bir C \u00d7Pn , where C is a curve\nwith field rational functions L. If C has positive genus then FML(X) \u2287 L. In particular, if\nFML(X) = k then C is rational.\nProof. Assume that C has positive genus. We have K = Frac A = L(x1 , . . . , xn ), where\nx1 , . . . , xn are new variables.\nWe claim that L \u2286 FML(A). Indeed, let \u2202 be an LND on A and let f, g \u2208 L \\ k. Since\ntr. degk (L) = 1, there exists a polynomial P \u2208 k[x, y] \\ k such that P (f, g) = 0. Applying\nthe derivation \u2202 : K \u2192 K to P (f, g) we obtain\n\u2202P\n\u2202P\n(f, g) * \u2202(f ) +\n(f, g) * \u2202(g) = 0 .\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\n\u2202P\nSince f and g are not constant we may suppose that \u2202P\n\u2202x (f, g) 6= 0 and \u2202y (f, g) 6= 0. Hence\n\u2202(f ) = 0 if and only if \u2202(g) = 0. This shows that one of the two following possibilities occurs:\n\nL \u2286 Frac(ker \u2202)\n\nor\n\nL \u2229 Frac(ker \u2202) = k .\n\nAssume first that L \u2229 Frac(ker \u2202) = k. Then, by Lemma 1.3 (i) Frac(ker \u2202) = k(x1 , . . . , xn )\nand so the field extension Frac(ker \u2202) \u2286 K is not purely transcendental. This contradits\nLemma 1.3 (vii). Thus L \u2286 Frac(ker \u2202) proving the claim and the lemma.\n\u0003\nRemark 5.5. We can apply Lemma 5.4 to show that the FML invariant carries more information than usual ML invariant. Indeed, let, in the notation of Lemma 4.2, Y be a smooth\nprojective curve of positive genus. Lemma 4.2 shows that ML(A[Y, D]) = k. While by Lemma\n5.4, FML(A[Y, D]) \u2287 KY .\nIn the following theorem we prove Conjecture 5.3 in dimension at most 3.\nTheorem 5.6. Let X be an affine variety of dimension dim X \u2264 3. If FML(X) = k then X\nis rational.\nProof. Since FML(X) is trivial, the same holds for ML(X). If dim X \u2264 2 then ML(X) = k\nimplies X rational (see e.g., [ML, p. 41]). Assume that dim X = 3. Lemma 4.1 implies that\nX \u2243bir C \u00d7 P2 for some curve C. While by Lemma 5.4, C is a rational curve.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[AH06]\n\nKlaus Altmann and J\u00fcrgen Hausen.
