Introduction\nIn magnetic data storage devices, the data bit is defined as the direction of the\nmagnetization. The information is stored by switching the magnetization to the desired\nconfiguration. In some cases, e.g. hard disk, conventional magnetoresistive random\naccess memory (MRAM), the switching is accomplished by a magnetic field generated\nby an electrical current, which is referred to Oersted field. The other approach recently\nconcerns with spin transfer effect in which the magnetization can be switched by a spinpolarized electron current. Spin transfer phenomenon involves the possibility to reverse\nthe magnetization in a ferromagnet without the application of an external field. This\neffect was theoretically predicted in 1996 by L. Berger [1] and J. Slonczewski [2]. It\nimmediately attracted much attention both for its fundamental interest as a new physical\neffect and its huge potential for applications in novel spintronics [3-6]. When a current\nflows through a ferromagnet, it is spin-polarized by the magnetization of the ferromagnet\nand carries an angular momentum. The current remains its polarization and so that the\nangular momentum can interact with the magnetization in subsequent magnetic layer.\nThe spin current exerts a torque (spin-transfer torque - STT) on the magnetization of the\nsubsequent layer that can lead to precession and reversal. STT-MRAM [7] is a typical\napplication of the spin-transfer torque in magnetic multilayer nanostructure in which the\ninformation, which is stored in the magnetization of the film layer, is reversed by using a\nspin-polarized current.\nMotion of the magnetic domain walls (DWs) under spin-polarized current is also known\nas a consequence of the spin-transfer torque phenomenon and technologically applied in a\nnumber of novel spintronic devices such as spin-logic gate [3,4] racetrack memory [5,6],\n\n2\n\n\fetc. In such devices, the bits of information are stored as magnetic domains in nano-sized\nmagnetic wires and controlled by a spin-polarized current flowed along the wires.\nWriting of a bit is performed by switching the magnetization direction of a domain by\nmeans of a localized external field obtained from for example the Oersted field from a\ncrossing wire [8], or alternatively by means of STT with passing a current from a\nmagnetic nano-element into the wire.\nIn previous work [9], we proclaimed the possibility to control the STT motion of DWs in\nperpendicularly magnetized single-layer TbFeCo with very low current density (~ 5\u00d71010\nAm-2 and high DW speed (30-50 m/s). Thus, the single TbFeCo film with low saturation\nmagnetization, narrow DW width and high anisotropy [10] is very promising for highperformance, low-energy DW devices.\nIn this paper, we present a demonstration that the writing of domain in TbFeCo can be\nmodulated by adjusting either the writing pulse or external magnetic field that is\nimportant for writing process in memory devices.\n\n2. Experimental\nNanowire with 300 nm width, 150 \uf06dm length was fabricated by means of electron beam\nlithography and a lift-off technique. A 300 nm thick ZEP 520A e-beam resist was firstly\ncoated on a Si substrate by spin coating. Pattern was then written by a CABL 8000 beam\nwriter system with an accelerated voltage of 30 kV, a beam current of 100 pA. The\nTb24Fe68.4Co7.6 (20 nm in thickness) film was grown on naturally oxidized Si substrate by\nRF magnetron sputtering in Ar gas. The base vacuum was 3\u00d710-8 Torr whereas the Ar\npressure was fixed at 2 mTorr. To avoid the ambient oxidization, the film was capped by\n\n3\n\n\fa 1 nm thick Pt layer. For magnetransport measurement, the wire was modified to be in\nHall-bar shape and connected to external electrical sources via a Ti/Al electrodes system\nmade by photolithography and electron beam evaporation (see Fig. 1).\n\n3. Results and discussion\nFirst of all, the motion of DWs in the TbFeCo single layer nanowire is demonstrated. As\nseen from Fig. 1, a pulse current with a frequency of 1.6 MHz (with a pulse width\nvarying from 5 to 40 ns) was flowed along the electrode A-B. This current generated a\npulsed Oersted field, which acts to nucleate a tiny domain as the region between the\nsquare pad and the wire. Such a tiny domain would be driven to move along the wire by a\nDC current, JDC, passed through the wire in accordance with the spin-transfer torque\nphenomenon described in the last paragraphs. When each domain passed a Hall cross-bar\n(either C-D or E-F), it caused a change in the Hall-effect voltage measured between the\nelectrodes. Figure 2(a) illustrates the waveform of the Hall-effect voltage versus time in\nwhich the pulse-like of the signal denoted the tiny domains passed the Hall cross-bar.\nThis waveform is similar to the previous results published elsewhere [11,12]. The pulselike could be qualitatively understood via a schematic drawn in Fig. 2(b): when the\ndomain was moving in the straight wire area, the Hall signal was constant; the Hall signal\nstarted increasing at the time T1 as the front-edge wall entered the Hall cross-bar; the\nHall-effect voltage remained its high value when the front-edge was drifting inside the\nHall bar T2\u00f7T3 and switched to low value as the rear-edge wall moved into the cross-bar\n(T3\u00f7T4); the T4 interval denoted the time that the rear-edge wall of the domain passed the\nHall bar. Hence, the interval T2-T1 and T4-T3 denoted the velocities of the front-edge and\n\n4\n\n\frear-edge walls of the domain inside the cross-bar, respectively whereas the interval T3T1 reflected the length of the domain [11]. By the same approach, the velocity of the\ndomain traveling in the straight area between the electrodes C-E was determined by\nmeasuring the phase delay between the Hall signals at the electrodes C-D and E-F [11].\nTo obtain such waveform of the Hall-effect signal, minimum DC current values of 0.21\nmA was required, corresponding to a critical current density of Jc = 3.5\u00d71010 Am-2. Such\nlow threshold current density is consistently reduced in comparison with previous result\nof the TbFeCo nanowire [9] which experimentally proved that the narrower wire was\nused, less driven current was postulated. This critical current density could be ascribed as\none of the lowest value to control magnetic domain walls in the nanowire up to now.\nIt was found that two intervals T2 \u2013 T1 and T4-T3 were mostly equal each other, certifying\nthat velocities of the front-edge and rear-edge walls were perfectly indistinguishable.\nMoreover, these velocities were also nicely equivalent to the velocity of the domain\nrunning in the straight area, supposing that the motion of the domains through the Hall\ncross-bar and the straight area of the wire (without Hall bars) was simply identical to\neach other, pinning effect was relatively weak and the structure of the domains was\nmostly conservative.\nFigure 3 shows the dependence of the front-edge wall's velocity on the driven current\ndensity at various external fields. The current dependence of the velocity revealed that the\nmotion of the walls was driven by the spin-transfer torque mechanism and was accordant\nwith the adiabatic model at weak pinning regime in which the velocity is given by [13]:\nv~\n\n2\nJ DC\n\uf02d J C2\n\n(1)\n\n5\n\n\fWhere, JDC is the driven current density, Jc is known as the critical current density. In this\nmodel, the current could not drive the wall if the associated spin current was smaller than\nthe critical value [13,14]. It should be noted that the variation of the DW velocity in the\nFig. 3 is analogous to previous results on TbFeCo microwires [9] of which the wall\nvelocity was consistent with the law given in the equation (1). The results appeared in Fig.\n3 on the other hand indicated that the critical current density was independent on the\nexternal field, whilst the wall's velocity was slightly enhanced by the external field.\nCurrent-dependence here tended to shift to high velocity regime when the applied field\nincreased that is in agreement with no pinning regime, in which the motion of a DW\nalong a magnetic nanowire was imputed to be distinct characteristics depending on the\nstrength of the applied field and the motion of the wall could be analytically described as\nv(H) ~ H [14]. It is interesting to note that the effect of the external field on the motion of\ntwo walls of the domain became unequal when the field was too high (over 1000 Oe),\nand the distortion of the domain due to the Oersted field was believed.\nThe modulation of domain writing in TbFeCo was conducted by adjusting the pulse\ncurrent - which was used to nucleate the domains in the TbFeCo nanowire. The\nfrequency of the pulse was fixed at 1.6 MHz whereas the pulse width was varied from 540 ns. By analyzing the signal of the Hall-effect voltage, the domain length was deducted.\nFigure 4 presents the pulse-width dependence of the domain size measured at a magnetic\nfield of 50 Oe. It is apparent that the domain size depends on the pulse duration as a\nlinear function and it shifts to higher value as increasing the external field. This can be\nunderstood that the pulse current, known as writing current, generated a pulsed Oersted\nfield perpendicular to the surface of the film and the current. The size of the nucleated\n\n6\n\n\fdomain was defined by the time that the Oersted field applied to the film. A longer time\nof the pulse duration, the Oersted field acted more time on the film and the size of the\ndomain became longer along the wire. Turning back to the waveform of the Hall-effect\nsignal (see Fig. 2(a)), the nucleation of the domains in the wire was synchronic with the\nperiodic pulse (1.6 MHz frequency). These evidences confirmed that the domain stored in\nthe TbFeCo nanowire could be modulated by the writing pulse current. With the\nminimum pulse duration of 5 ns, it was able to storage a minimum domain size of\n630\u00b150 nm.\nFigure 5 depicts the variation of the domain length with the external applied field\nobtained by a writing pulse with pulse duration of 10 ns. A logarithmic variation of the\ndomain length was credibly observed here. It means that the domain writing would be\nmodulated by the external field as:\nL = L0 + k\u00d7log(H+H0)\n\n(2)\n\nHere, L0, H0 are initial length and field constants, k is a coefficient, respectively.\nThis showed that the external field was taken into account to the Oersted field from the\nwriting current to expand the nucleated domains. Extrapolating the logarithmic\ndependence, the length of the domain would be reduced to 450 nm as the field was zero.\nThis was previously discussed that when an external magnetic field was applied\nperpendicularly to the film, the nucleated domain - reversed domain, would shrink or\nexpand in order to release the Zeeman energy to compensate the energy dissipation due to\nthe moving DW [15,16]. The domain only stopped shrinking or expanding as the dipolar\ninteraction field was balanced with the external field and the domain was only stable with\nthe length larger than the DW width where the repulsive force due to dipolar field was\n\n7\n\n\fdominant. The results here suggested that the magnetization in nucleated domain here\nwas in the same direction to the external field.\n\n4. Conclusions\nMotion of magnetic domain walls in the TbFeCo nanowire by very low current density\nup to Jc = 3.5\u00d71010 Am-2 has been demonstrated in terms of magnetotransport\nmeasurement. We have established writing of tiny domain (minimum to 630 nm) into the\nTbFeCo nanowire by combining the nucleation pulse current (30 mA amplitude, 1.6 MHz\nfrequency, 5-40 ns length) and DC driven current. The size of the domain could be\nmodulated by adjusting either external magnetic field or the length of the nucleation\npulse. This contribution could be considered as an important note of which the writing\nprocess in the DW spin-torque devices must be taken care.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was financially supported by the fellowship funded by the Toyota School\nFoundation.\n\n8\n\n\fReferences\n[1]\n\nL.
