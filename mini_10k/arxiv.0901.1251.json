The most distinct example is the ratio of the so\ncalled HBT radii Rout and Rside \u2013 in the typical hydrodynamic calculations\nit comes out too large, exceeding the experimentally measured values by\nabout 20-50%.\nIn our recent work [11], we have found that the consistent description\nof one- and two-particle observables in the soft region is achieved within\nthe hydrodynamic model if one modifies the initial conditions \u2013 the initial\nenergy profile obtained in most cases from the optical Glauber model should\nbe replaced by the Gaussian profile. Other ingredients of our model, such as\nthe use of the semi-hard equation of state, are also important for the overall\ngood agreement, however, taken into account alone they are not sufficient to\nget the satisfactory results. In this aspect, our findings are complementary\n\n\f3\n\nto the observations made recently by Pratt (Ref. [12] and these proceedings\n[13]).\nOur approach is based on the 2+1 boost-invariant inviscid hydrodynamics [14, 15, 16] followed by the statistical-hadronization model THERMINATOR [17]. The initial energy-density profiles are obtained from the\nMonte-Carlo Glauber model GLISSANDO [18], which includes the eccentricity fluctuations [19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. The results of those calculations\nare approximated by the Gaussians. The thermal event generator THERMINATOR simulates hadron emission from the freeze-out hypersurface determined by the hydrodynamic calculation. The single freeze-out scenario\n[24, 25] is assumed with the universal final temperature Tf =145 MeV1 .\nBesides the final temperature our model has essentially two additional parameters: the initial temperature Ti , fixing the absolute normalization, and\nthe initial time for the start of hydrodynamics, \u03c40 = 0.25 fm. For each\ncentrality class, the widths of the two-dimensional initial Gaussian energy\ndistribution are obtained directly from the GLISSANDO simulations.\nFigure 1 shows our results for the transverse-momentum spectra of pions,\nkaons, and protons for the centrality classes c = 0-5% and c = 20-30%.\nFig. 1 presents also our results for v2 for the centrality c = 20-40%, plotted\nas functions of the transverse momentum. The spectra and the elliptic\nflow are compared to the RHIC data [9, 10]. We observe a very good\nagreement between the model predictions and the data. The small excess\nof the theoretical proton v2 above the data may be attributed to the lack of\nrescattering in the final state.\nFigure 2 presents our results for the pion HBT radii Rside , Rout , Rlong ,\nand the ratio Rout /Rside for central collisions, compared to the RHIC data\n[27]. The left panel shows our best results obtained with the traditional\nGlauber initial condition [28], while the right panel shows the results obtained with the Gaussian initial condition [11]. One observes that a very\ngood agreement between the data and the theoretical model predictions is\nachieved in the case where the Gaussian initial condition is used. We note\nthat the calculation of the radii does not introduce any extra parameters.\nAll the characteristics of the emitting source were already fixed by the fits to\nthe spectra and v2 . Finally, in Fig. 3 the results describing the azimuthal dependence of the HBT radii are plotted [29]. Here R2 (\u03c6) = R02 + 2R22 cos(2\u03c6).\nAgain, we observe a very good agreement between the data and our model\nfor different centralities and different average momenta of the pion pairs kT .\nOur results indicate that it is possible to achieve a consistent hydrodynamic description of one- and two-particle soft hadronic data collected in the\n1\n\nThe relatively high decoupling temperature may be connected with the presence of\nthe instabilities at the phase transition connected with the diverging bulk viscosity\n[26].\n\n\f4\n\nFig. 2.

Left: our best results obtained with the\nGlauber initial condition [28]. Right: our results obtained with the Gaussian initial\nconditions (i.e., with the Gaussian approximation to the the Glauber simulations)\n[11].\n\nRHIC heavy-ion experiments at the highest beam energies. In particular,\nit is possible to describe simultaneously the transverse-momentum spectra,\nthe elliptic flow coefficient v2 , and the HBT correlation radii (the preliminary results show that the correlations of the non-identical particles are\nalso well reproduced in our model). Our finding suggests that there exists a\nsolution to the long standing RHIC HBT puzzle understood as the failure of\nthe relativistic hydrodynamics in reproducing consistently the spectra and\nthe HBT radii.\nThe Gaussian initial profile leads to a faster development of the initial\ntransverse flow which makes the system evolution shorter. At the same time\nthe transverse size of the system at freeze-out is slightly larger (as compared\nto the standard Glauber scenario). These two effects put together lead to\nthe desired reduction of the ratio Rout /Rside . In the approach discussed in\nRefs. [12, 13], the crucial role of the faster initial acceleration [14, 30] is also\nemphasized. However, in [13] this effect comes from the very early start of\nthe hydrodynamics, \u03c40 = 0.1, fm and from the inclusion of viscous terms\nwhich increase the transverse acceleration with respect to the longitudinal\none. We stress, however, that our approach remains the only one which\n\n\f40\n\nR2long,0\n\nR2side,0\n\nR2out,0\n\n5\n\n40\n\n30\n\n30\n\n20\n\n20\n\n10\n\n10\n\n60\n40\n20\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n\u22120.1\n\n200\n\n300\nNpart\n\nRout\u2212side,2/R2side,0\n\n0\n\n100\nNpart\n\nR2side,2/R2side,0\n\nR2out,2/R2side,0\n\nNpart\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0\n0\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n100\nNpart\n\n200\n\n300\n\n100\nNpart\n\n200\n\n300\nNpart\n\nFig. 3.

[12, 13] are restricted to the cylindrically symmetric case.\nClearly, the issue of the relative importance of the initial energy profile,\nthe initial pre-equilibrium flow, and the viscous effects should be addressed\nin further investigations. The recent calculation [31] shows that the preequilibrium flow is inevitable as it comes from the energy-momentum conservation laws. On the other hand, the specific amount of the pre-equilibrium\nflow required to correctly describe the data depends on the initial energydensity profile. In [32] we have assumed that the start of the hydrodynamic\nevolution may be delayed to \u03c4 = 1 fm. The earlier evolution consists of the\nfree-streaming (in the proper time interval: 0.25 fm \u2264 \u03c4 \u2264 1 fm) followed\nby the sudden equilibration and transition to the hydrodynamic regime (at\n\u03c4 = 1 fm). We have used again the Gaussian initial conditions and shown\nthat they lead the sufficient amount of the pre-equilibrium transverse flow\nat \u03c4 = 1 fm, when the hydrodynamic evolution starts, i.e., the FS+SE approach of Ref. [32] describes the data equally well as our standard approach.\nThis behavior suggest some interesting universality of the Gaussian initial\nconditions. Of course, the open question remains to find the microscopic\nmechanism leading to such a form of the initial conditions.\n\n\f6\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] D. Teaney, J. Lauret, E. V. Shuryak, Phys. Rev.
