However, because this screening is caused by\na lightly doped semiconductor as opposed to a metal, we\nare able to tune both the rate and the magnitude of the\nscreening effect in situ by varying the temperature and\ndepth of the depletion region in the substrate, respectively. This tunability allows us to quantify the effect of\nscreening for our system. We demonstrate that, despite\nthe effects of electrostatic screening, our nanoscale electrometer can still detect very small charge fluctuations,\neven at room temperature.\nThe device used in these experiments has been discussed previously [9], and consists of a nanometer scale\nsilicon MOSFET that is electrostatically coupled to a\nstrip of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H). An\nelectron micrograph of the device is shown in Fig. 1(a).\nThe n-channel MOSFET is fabricated using standard\nCMOS techniques on a silicon substrate.

Utilized in these\nconfigurations, nanoscale electrometers have had a great\nimpact on the study of single electron devices [3\u20137], disordered materials [8, 9], and high mobility two dimensional\nelectron gases [10, 11]. The small size of these electrometers can lead to high charge sensitivities [12], which are\ncentral to many of these applications. It is widely recognized that, of the many factors that may limit the sensitivity of a nanoscale electrometer, electrostatic screening\nis likely to be one of the most important. However, because in most cases the effect of the screening is more or\nless fixed, and cannot be easily tuned, there have been\nfew if any experimental investigations of this effect.\n\na-Si:H\n\nAu\n\noxide\n\ndepletion\n\nLD\np-Si\n\n(d)\nGM (\u03bcS)\n\narXiv:1006.5948v1 [cond-mat.mes-hall] 30 Jun 2010\n\n1\n\n3.0\n2.5\n0\n\n\u2206Au\n\u2206aSi\n\n1\n2\ntime (s)\n\n10\n8\n0\n\n5 10 15\ntime (s)\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Electron micrograph of MOSFET gate , a-Si:H\nstrip, and gold contacts.

For all of the\nwork discussed here, a positive voltage is applied to the\ngate of the MOSFET, so that an inversion layer forms at\nthe Si-SiO2 interface beneath the gate, as shown in Fig.\n1(b).

We measure GM by applying a small voltage\n\u223c 5 mV to one contact, and measuring the current that\nflows out through the other. We make electrical contact\nto the p-type substrate through the back of the chip. For\nthe data reported below, we negatively bias the p-type\nsubstrate by Vsub = -3 V relative to the n-type contacts\nunless otherwise indicated.\nThe conductance of the MOSFET is extremely sensitive to its electrostatic environment. In particular, GM\nis sensitive to changes in charge in either the a-Si:H or\nthe gold contacts. As we show below, this sensitivity is\nsignificantly affected by screening by the p-type silicon\nsubstrate: If charge Q is added to the a-Si:H or gold\ncontacts, an oppositely charged region will form in the\nsubstrate underneath, thereby reducing the effect of Q\non GM . This screening charge is located at the Si-SiO2\ninterface, or, if the silicon beneath the Si-SiO2 interface\nis depleted of holes (Fig. 1(b)), the screening charge will\nbe located a distance LD beneath the Si-SiO2 interface.\nOur measurement consists of stepping the voltage VaSi\napplied to one of the a-Si:H gold contacts while simultaneously monitoring GM . An example is shown in Fig.\n1(c). Here we set the voltage applied to one gold contact\nto 0 V, and apply the voltage sequence shown in the top\ntrace of Fig. 1(c) to the other contact [13]. The bottom\ntrace of Fig. 1(c) shows the variation in GM in response\nto the voltage sequence. When VaSi is first stepped from\n-1.8 V to -2.7 V, GM drops by an amount \u2206Au in a time\ntoo short to measure, and then decreases slowly by an\namount \u2206aSi .\nAs we have demonstrated in MacLean et al. [9], the\nslow change \u2206aSi in GM is caused by the slow addition of\nnegative charge to the a-Si:H. The MOSFET electrometer senses this change in charge electrostatically, and\nGM decreases as negative charge is added to the a-Si:H.\nThe time scale of this charging is a direct measurement\nof the resistance of the a-Si:H strip [9]. The much more\nrapid drop \u2206Au in GM is caused by the negative charge\nadded to the gold contacts, which charge up very quickly\nbecause of their low electrical resistance. When VaSi is\nreturned to -1.8 V, the same responses \u2206Au and \u2206aSi are\nobserved but with the opposite sign, as negative charge\nis now removed from the gold and the a-Si:H. A similar\nresponse is observed when the voltage sequence is applied\nto the other gold contact, or to both contacts at the same\ntime.\nTo confirm that our interpretation of the data is correct, we study a separate device where, like the device\nshown in Fig. 1(a), a strip of a-Si:H is patterned adjacent to a nanoscale MOSFET. However, for this device,\nthe strip of a-Si:H is connected to only one of the two\ngold contacts. The data is shown in Fig. 1(d).

The top trace shows the voltage\nstep applied to the a-Si:H gold contact. For the lower trace,\nthe solid black curve is a fit to an exponential, as discussed in\nthe main text. (b) Screening rate rS as a function of inverse\ntemperature. (c) Change in screening rate \u2206rS as a function\nof inverse temperature, as described in the main text. The\nsolid line is a theoretical fit described in the main text. For\nall of these data, Vsub = 0.\n\nwe step one contact from 0 to -9.9 V, while the other\ncontact is held constant at 0 V. A rapid drop \u2206Au is observed when the pulse is applied to either one of the gold\ncontacts, but the slower response \u2206aSi is only observed\nwhen the pulse is applied to the gold which is connected\nto the strip of a-Si:H, confirming our interpretation of\nthe data.\nThe sensitivity of GM to its electrostatic environment\ndepends on screening by the underlying p-type silicon\nsubstrate. To demonstrate this, we examine the response\nof the MOSFET to changes in charge in the gold contacts\nat a temperature T \u2248 10 K, lower than the temperature\nat which the data shown in Fig. 1 are acquired. At\nthis temperature, the a-Si:H is so resistive that it does\nnot charge up on the time scale of the experiment [9], so\nthat we can add charge to the a-Si:H gold contacts but\nnot to the a-Si:H itself. The results are shown in Fig.\n2(a). When we change the voltage applied to the a-Si:H\ngold contacts from 0 to -1 V (top trace), we see a large\ndecrease in the MOSFET conductance, which gradually\ndies away as time progresses (bottom trace).\nThe gradual dying away of the decrease in GM can be\nunderstood in terms of screening. When we add charge\nto the gold contact, an opposing charge in the p-type\nsubstrate is induced, reducing the overall effect on GM .\nAt low temperatures, the resistance of the substrate is\nhigh, and this charge is induced at a slow rate. To quantify this rate, we fit the GM trace to an exponential\n\n\f3\n\n0.2\n\nGM (\u03bcS)\n\n0.3\n11.4\n11.2\n\n\u2206 (\u03bcS)\n\nGM (t) = G\u221e + Gscr e\u2212rS t , where G\u221e and Gscr are constants that depend on the voltages applied to the MOSFET gate, p-type substrate, and gold electrodes, and rS\nis the screening rate.\nTo show that this screening effect is caused by the ptype silicon substrate, we measure rS as a function of\ntemperature. The results are shown in Fig. 2(b). As the\ntemperature is reduced, rS drops, saturating at a minimum value rmin \u2248 8 Hz. In Fig. 2(c), we plot \u2206rS = rS\n- rmin as a function of inverse temperature, and fit to an\nactivated temperature dependence \u2206rS \u221d e\u2212EA /kT . We\nobtain EA = 45 \u00b1 5 meV, which agrees well with the\nboron acceptor binding energy [14]. For boron-doped silicon with no donor compensation, the Fermi level lies\nbetween the valence band and the boron donor level, and\nthe activation energy for hole transport is therefore half\nof the boron acceptor binding energy. However, at sufficiently low temperatures, a small concentration of compensating donor states caused by defects or impurities\nND will move the Fermi level into the acceptor band [15].\nIn our case, the number of defects required is only ND \u223c\n1010 cm\u22123 . Because the required density is so small, we\nexpect the Fermi level to lie in the acceptor band, and\nthe activation energy required for the generation of holes\nin the valence band to be the boron acceptor binding energy. The correspondence between the activation energy\nfor the screening and the boron acceptor binding energy\ndemonstrates that the conductivity of the boron doped\nsubstrate limits rS . Presumably rS saturates at a minimum value rmin because some conduction mechanism\nother than activation of holes in the p-type substrate\ndominates at low temperature. It is possible that this\nlow temperature conduction occurs via tunneling of electrons between acceptor states [15] in the p-type substrate.\nIn any case, from this data it is clear that screening by\nholes in the boron doped substrate significantly reduces\nthe sensitivity of the MOSFET.\nAt higher temperatures T > 25 K, rS becomes too\nfast for us to measure. In this regime, we investigate the\ndependence of \u2206aSi and \u2206Au on VaSi . The results are\nshown in Fig. 3. Here we step the voltage applied to both\ngold contacts from VaSi to VaSi \u2212 \u2206V , where \u2206V = 0.5\nV. We extract \u2206aSi and \u2206Au from the resulting GM (t)\ntrace as depicted in Fig. 1(c). We measure both \u2206aSi\nand \u2206Au as a function of VaSi and find that both of these\nquantities decrease as VaSi is made more negative. The\ndecreases in \u2206aSi and \u2206Au are clearly visible when the\nGM (t) traces taken at different VaSi values are compared,\nas is shown in the inset to Fig. 3.\nThese results can be understood in terms of screening\nby the p-type substrate in the following way: At VaSi = 0\nV, the p-type substrate beneath the Si-SiO2 is depleted,\nas depicted in Fig. 1(a). As VaSi is made more negative,\nLD is reduced beneath the gold and the a-Si:H. This has\nthe effect of making the screening more effective, because\nit brings the holes in the substrate closer to the charge\n\n0\n\n10\n20\ntime (ms)\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n-20\n\n-10\nVaSi (V)\n\n0\n\nFIG. 3: \u2206aSi (blue circles) and \u2206Au (gold circles) measured\nas a function of VaSi at T = 139 K, as discussed in the main\ntext. For these data, we make the MOSFET gate voltage\nmore positive as VaSi is made more negative so that GM \u2248 11\n\u03bcS at the start of each GM (t) trace. (Inset) Examples of data\nfrom which \u2206aSi and \u2206Au are extracted for two different VaSi\nvalues. For both GM (t) traces, VaSi is stepped by -0.5 V at\nt = 0. The data are offset vertically by a small amount for\nclarity. The blue and red data sets are taken at the positions\nof the blue and red arrows, respectively. The decrease in\nboth \u2206aSi and \u2206Au with increasingly negative VaSi is clearly\nvisible.\n\nthey are screening. As a result, both \u2206Au and \u2206aSi\ndecrease as VaSi is made more negative [16].\nThe response of GM to the gold \u2206Au decreases as VaSi\nis made more negative until VaSi \u2248 -8 V, at which point\nit saturates. This saturation is expected, because once\nthe depletion layer below the gold shrinks to zero, so that\nthe Si-SiO2 interface underneath the gold is in accumulation, the distance between the charge on the gold and\nthe screening charge is fixed at the SiO2 thickness (100\nnm). \u2206aSi does not appear to saturate as VaSi is made\nmore negative. This is not surprising, because the a-Si:H\nis very close to the MOSFET gate. Because there must\nalways be a depletion layer between the inversion layer\nof the MOSFET and the p-type substrate, the Si-SiO2\ninterface underneath the a-Si:H cannot be brought into\naccumulation, and the signal does not saturate. It is however surprising that for VaSi < -10 V, \u2206Au is larger than\n\u2206aSi . Although the gold contacts are physically much\nlarger than the a-Si:H strip, which enhances their effect\non GM relative to the a-Si:H, the a-Si:H strip is much\ncloser to the MOSFET, so one would not expect \u2206Au\never to be significantly larger than \u2206aSi . Thus, although\n\n\f4\n\nGM (\u03bcS)\n\nIaSi (nA)\n\n(a)\n\n35\n30\n\n5.18\n5.16\n5.14\n0\n\nc(\u03c4)\n\n(b)\n\n50\ntime (s)\n\n100\n\n0\n\u03c4 (s)\n\n100\n\n0.0\n-0.5\n-100\n\nFIG. 4: Noise correlations measured at room temperature.\n(a) Current through a-Si:H strip IaSi (top trace) and transistor conductance GM (bottom trace) as a function of time.\nHere we apply a constant voltage bias of 2 V across the a-Si:H\nstrip. (c) Correlation between IaSi and GM , as discussed in\nthe main text.\n\nthe dependencies of \u2206aSi and \u2206Au on VaSi can be understood in terms of screening, the relative magnitudes of\nthese quantities are not currently understood. We have\nalso measured the dependence of \u2206Au and \u2206aSi on VaSi\nat T = 98 K and T = 179 K. The results are qualitatively similar, but the relative magnitudes of \u2206aSi and\n\u2206Au change somewhat depending on the temperature, a\nresult that is also currently not understood.\nWe have thus seen that screening by holes in the ptype substrate decreases the sensitivity of our MOSFET\nelectrometer. We expect that there are other sources\nof screening in our system, for instance by the metallic\ngate of the MOSFET. Despite the effect of screening, our\nelectrometer is still sensitive to very small charge fluctuations in the a-Si:H, even at room temperature. An\nintriguing demonstration of this is the sensitivity of the\nMOSFET to telegraph noise switches in the a-Si:H. 1/f\nnoise and discrete telegraph switches have been observed\npreviously in the resistance of macroscopic a-Si:H samples [17]. The discrete switching that is sometimes observed occurs for samples where the conductance is dominated by filaments small enough to be affected by a single\nswitch. While the microscopic origin of 1/f noise in aSi:H is unclear, its phenomenology is quite rich, and it\nis closely connected with Staebler-Wronski effect [18], as\ndemonstrated in Parman et al. [19].\nAt room temperature, where the resistance of the aSi:H is not too large, we apply a voltage between the\n\ntwo gold a-Si:H contacts and measure the current IaSi\nthat flows through the a-Si:H strip. The top trace of Fig.\n4(a) shows IaSi measured as a function of time, exhibiting clear telegraph noise. This switching appeared and\ndisappeared apparently randomly, lasting \u223c 1 day. Because our sample is nanopatterned, it is not clear whether\nthe origin of the telegraph noise we observe is the same\nas the origin of the noise found in bulk a-Si:H samples.\nHowever, the conductance of our heavily doped a-Si:H\nstrip is only weakly dependent on the voltages of nearby\ngates, such as the voltage applied to the MOSFET gate\nor p-type substrate. For example, we find that we must\nchange the MOSFET gate voltage by \u223c 30 V in order\nto produce a change in IaSi as large as the \u223c 5 pA fluctuations shown in Fig. 4(a). The narrow a-Si:H strip is\nthus not very sensitive to its electrostatic environment,\nand it is therefore likely that the switching seen in Fig.\n4(a) results from fluctuations inside or on the surface of\nthe a-Si:H, as opposed to electron trapping external to\nthe a-Si:H.\nAs we measure IaSi (t), we simultaneously measure\nGM (t), and the results are plotted in the bottom trace of\nFig. 4(a). We see that IaSi and GM are anti-correlated.\nWhen IaSi jumps up, GM jumps down, and vice versa.\nThis anti-correlation is demonstrated quantitatively in\nFig. 4(b). Here we measure IaSi and GM simultaneously for a much longer time than shown in Fig. 4(a),\nand compute the cross-correlation function between the\ntwo signals c(\u03c4 ) [20]. Here we have normalized c(\u03c4 ) by\nsubtracting the product of the means of IaSi and GM ,\nand then dividing by the product of their standard deviations [21]. We see that for our data c(\u03c4 ) has a negative\npeak at \u03c4 = 0 with a value \u2248 \u22120.6, indicating that the\ntwo signals IaSi and GM are highly anti-correlated: With\nour normalization c(0) = \u22121 corresponds to perfect anticorrelation.\nFrom these data, it is clear that the MOSFET electrometer can detect single switches in a material adjacent to it. It may be that electrostatic fluctuations\nthat give rise to the switching noise in the a-Si:H current are detected by the MOSFET directly, or that these\nfluctuations change the charge distribution along the aSi:H strip to which the MOSFET is extremely sensitive.\nWe have observed telegraph noise in the current through\nnanopatterned strips of a-Si:H other than the one studied\nhere, but these samples were not fabricated adjacent to a\nMOSFET charge sensor. The intermittency of the switch\ninvestigated here made it difficult to study in detail, and\nmore work is required to determine the mechanism by\nwhich the MOSFET senses these switches.\nIn summary, we have shown experimentally that electrostatic screening significantly affects the charge sensitivity of a nanometer scale electrometer and that despite this effect, the electrometer is still very sensitive to\nits electrostatic environment, even at room temperature.\nWe expect that this work will be used to help mitigate\n\n\f5\nthe effects of screening in the development of even more\nsensitive nanoscale electrometers.\nThis work was supported by the Department of Energy under Award Number DE-FG02-08ER46515 and in\npart by the US Army Research Office under Contract\nW911NF-07-D-0004.\n\n\u2217\nElectronic address: kmaclean@mit.edu\n[1] M.
