The magnetic entropy change and ultrasonic properties in intermediate phase\nII indicate that the degeneracy of internal degrees of freedom is not fully lifted in spite of the\nformation of magnetic order. The ultrasonic attenuation and huge softening of C44 in phase\nII suggest the existence of electric-quadrupolar (orbital) fluctuations of 4f -electrons. These\nunusual properties originate from a geometrical quadrupolar frustration.\nKEYWORDS: DyB4 , quadrupole order, Shastry-Sutherland lattice, geometrical quadrupolar frustration,\nquadrupolar fluctuation\n\nA geometrical frustration, that is, a geometrical prohibition against satisfying the lowest-energy state of each\nbipartite bond, leads to various unusual physical properties, that often cause an extensive degeneracy in the\nground state of a system and prevent ordering. A wellknown example is the spin frustration in triangular antiferromagnets, such as CsCoCl3 and CsNiCl3 , that causes\nvarious magnetic-ordering processes.1\u20135) A renewed interest in geometrical frustration systems has resulted\nfrom the discoveries of new magnetic properties in certain materials. Two examples of these materials are the\npyrochlore oxides Dy2 Ti2 O7 and Ho2 Ti2 O7 considered\nto be model systems of spin ice materials.6, 7) A spin\nice model shows a strong geometrical frustration arising\nfrom the competition between a ferromagnetic nearestneighbor interaction and an axial single-ion anisotropy.\nThe spins in this model are disordered with local configurations obeying the ice rule in every tetrahedron, and the\nground state is macroscopically degenerated with a residual entropy. In fact, Dy2 Ti2 O7 shows a residual entropy\nof \u223c 1.68 J/mol K, which is numerically in agreement\nwith Pauling's entropy for water ice, R(1/2) ln(3/2).8)\nAnother new noteworthy discovery is the formation of\nunusual short-range order named the magnetic random\nlayer (MRL) lattice in RB2 C (R = Dy, Ho),9) that results\nin an unusual neutron scattering in the low-wave-number\nregion. The unconventional MRL state with large magnetic fluctuations originates from the frustrated nature\nof the Shastry-Sutherland lattice (SSL) consisting of the\nrare-earth atoms.10)\nIn this letter, we focus on a frustration of the orbital\n(quadrupole) degrees of freedom for 4f electron system,\nand propose that DyB4 is the first example of a geometrically quadrupolar (orbital) frustrated system. DyB4 crystallizes in the tetragonal ThB4 -type structure belonging\n5\n\u2212 P 4/mbm.11\u201313) The boron atoms\nto space group D4h\nform a continuous three-dimensional network. The Dy\natoms are located below and above the centers of the\nseven-membered boron rings in densely packed planes\n\u2217 E-mail\n\naddress: ryu-wat@issp.u-tokyo.ac.jp\n\nof boron atoms. All Dy atoms occupy the equivalent\nsites having orthorhombic symmetry C2v (Fig. 4 (a)).\nThe two-dimensional layer of the Dy atoms is formed by\nfused equilateral triangles and squares. It can be considered that this arrangement of the Dy atoms is the\nSSL. Previous studies of the magnetic properties of DyB4\nhave shown that it orders antiferromagnetically.14, 15)\nTwo second-order magnetic phase transitions have been\ndiscovered at 20.4 K and 12.8 K.16) A neutron diffraction study of Dy11 B4 was performed at 4.2 K.17) The\ndeduced magnetic structure is a simple collinear antiferromagnetic one with the sequence (+ + \u2212\u2212) for the four\nDy atoms in the tetragonal unit cell. The magnetic moments are oriented parallel to the [001]-axis. However,\nit seems that the data is insufficient for determining the\ndetailed magnetic structure of DyB4 , owing to the strong\nabsorption of thermal neutrons by dysprosium. There are\nvery few reports on the physical properties of DyB4 and\nstudies from the point of view of the frustration and the\nrole of quadrupolar interactions are lacking. Here we investigate the details of the physical properties of DyB4\nby means of magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, and\nultrasonic measurements.\nSingle crystals of DyB4 were prepared by the Czochralski method in argon atmosphere using a tetra-arc furnace. The magnetization of DyB4 was measured using a\nSQUID magnetometer in the temperature range of 1.8\u2013\n300 K. The magnetic susceptibility measurements were\nperformed under zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled\n(FC) conditions. Specific heat measurement was carried\nout by the heat-relaxation method down to 1.9 K. The\nelastic properties of DyB4 were investigated by means\nof ultrasonic measurements. Ultrasonic measurement is\nan effective technique for examining the quadrupolar effect in an f -electron system with an orbitally degenerate\nground state, because the quadrupole of the 4f electron\ncouples to the elastic strain. The elastic constant C\u0393 of\nthe sample was obtained by C\u0393 = \u03c1v 2 , where v and \u03c1 represent the sound velocity and the mass density, respectively. v was measured by a phase comparator using dou-\n\n\f2\n\nJ.

No difference between the FC\nand ZFC susceptibilities in any direction is observed\nthroughout the whole temperature range; therefore, only\nZFC data are shown for clarification. The coincidence\nof the ZFC and FC data suggests that no spontaneous\nmagnetization is present in DyB4 . The susceptibility for\nH k [001] shows a maximum at about 21.0 K, and a\nsmall discontinuous drop occurs at 20.3 K. In addition, a\nsmall shoulder is observed at 13.0 K. On the other hand,\nsusceptibilities for H k [100] and H k [110] show no\nanomalies around 21 K, but exhibit cusplike maxima at\n13.0 K. These results suggest that the z and xy components of the magnetic moments order independently at\nTC1 \u223c 20.3 K and TC2 \u223c 13.0 K, respectively. The results\nmay be divided into three temperature regions, which are\nhereafter called phase I (T > TC1 ), II (TC2 < T < TC1 )\nand III (T < TC2 ) in the sequence of decreasing temperature. The magnetic structure in phase II is a partially\ndynamical one, that is, the components of the magnetic\nmoments parallel to the [001]-axis are ordered while the\nperpendicular components remain disordered; then, below TC2 , all components are ordered.\nThe inverse molar susceptibilities \u03c7\u22121 of DyB4 (the\ninset of Fig. 1) show linear temperature dependences\nabove 250 K for H k [001] and 35 K for H k [100]\nand H k [110]. The effective paramagnetic moments\n\u03bceff and the Weiss temperatures \u03b8p resulting from the\nk[001]\nCurie-Weiss fitting are as follows: \u03bceff\n= 10.44 \u03bcB\nk[001]\nk[100]\nk[100]\nand \u03b8p\n= \u22128.46 K; \u03bceff\n= 10.90 \u03bcB and \u03b8p\n=\nk[110]\nk[110]\n\u221233.40 K; \u03bceff\n= 10.75 \u03bcB and \u03b8p\n= \u221231.42 K.\nSince the effective paramagnetic moments are close to\nthat expected for a free Dy3+ ion, i.e., 10.63 \u03bcB , we conclude that the 4f electrons in DyB4 are well localized.\nThe antiferromagnetic \u03b8p are comparable to TC1 . These\nindicate that the spin frustration is small in DyB4 .\nThe specific heat of the single-crystalline sample of\nDyB4 shows two \u03bb-like anomalies that indicate exact\ntransition temperatures of TC1 = 20.3 K and TC2 =\n12.7 K. These transition temperatures are consistent\n\nwith those reported previously.16) Since the peak of the\nspecific heat at TC1 is very sharp, and moreover, \u03c7 for\nH k [001] shows the discontinuity at TC1 , the phase transition at TC1 seems to be a first-order one. In our present\nstudy, however, we cannot conclude whether this phase\ntransition is a first-order or a second-order transition because the discontinuity of \u03c7 at TC1 is very small and the\nelastic constants are continuous at TC1 (Fig. 3). Only\nthe z components of the magnetic moments order at TC1 ;\nthat is, the Z2-symmetry of the system breaks in phase II.\nTherefore, the phase transition at TC1 may be a secondorder one and may belong to the three-dimensional Ising\nuniversality class in which the peak of the specific heat\nat a phase transition is very sharp. The phase transition at TC2 is a typical second-order one. The temperature dependence of the magnetic specific heat divided by\ntemperature Cmag /T is shown in Fig. 2. The estimated\nmagnetic contribution Cmag to the specific heat of DyB4\nis obtained by subtracting the phononic part from the\ntotal specific heat of DyB4 ; the phonon contribution is\nobtained from a measurement of the isostructural and\nnonmagnetic compound LuB4 . We obtain the temperature dependence of the magnetic entropy per Dy3+ ion\nS by numerically integrating the data of Cmag /T vs T .\nThe magnetic entropy of approximately R ln 2 and R ln 4\nis released below TC2 and TC1 , respectively. The CEF\nground-state multiplet J = 15/2 of Dy3+ splits into eight\nE1/2 (\u03935 ) doublets in the CEF potential of the site with\nC2v symmetry in DyB4 . The result indicates that the\nCEF ground state of DyB4 is a pseudo-quartet consisting of two Kramers doublets with E1/2 (\u03935 ) symmetry. It\nis noted that the degeneracy due to the internal degrees\nof freedom is not fully lifted in spite of the formation of\nmagnetic order in phase II. A similar entropy change is\nshown in the quadrupolar compound DyB2 C2 .19) In this\ncase, the twofold Kramers degeneracy is conserved since\ntime-reversal symmetry is not broken by the antiferroquadrupolar ordering. On the other hand, in a conventional magnet, degeneracy is lifted below the magnetic\ntransition temperature since Zeeman splitting caused by\nan internal magnetic field is different in each Kramers\ndoublet. Hence, phase II of DyB4 is not the conventional\nmagnetically ordered state.\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nFull Paper\n\nFig. 3.

The transverse mode C44 associated with elastic\nstrain \u03b5yz or \u03b5zx exhibits a large softening of 10.4% below 120 K down to TC1 . On the other hand, the transverse mode (C11 \u2212 C12 )/2 and C66 show small softening\nof 0.8% and 0.6% between 70 K and TC1 , respectively.\nThe largest softening of C44 in phase I indicates that the\ndominant components of quadrupole moments in DyB4\nare Oyz = Jy Jz + Jz Jy and Ozx = Jz Jx + Jx Jz which\ncouple with the elastic strains \u03b5yz and \u03b5zx , respectively.\nFurthermore, in phase I, the elastic softenings are described by the equation C\u0393 (T ) = C\u03930 (T \u2212 TC0 )/(T \u2212 \u0398),\nwhich is deduced from the Curie term of the quadrupolestrain susceptibility. Here, \u0398 is proportional to the average quadrupole-quadrupole interaction between the\nDy3+ ions. TC0 = \u0398 + EJT , where EJT is the JahnTeller (4f electron\u2013lattice) coupling.20) The characteristic temperatures obtained are as follows: \u0398 = 2.26 K\nand TC0 = 4.61 K for C44 ; \u0398 = 3.95 K and TC0 = 4.19 K\nfor C66 ; \u0398 = 7.12 K and TC0 = 7.48 K for (C11 \u2212 C12 )/2.\nThe positive values of \u0398 indicate that the predominant\nquadrupolar interactions in DyB4 are ferro-type. C44\nshows a kink at TC1 and decreases abruptly with decreasing temperature from TC1 to TC2 . It should be noted that\nC44 shows a marked softening of 40% and its echo signal\nshrinks considerably throughout the whole temperature\nrange of magnetically ordered phase II. With decreasing\ntemperature, the elastic constants change their behavior at TC2 from softening to hardening, and then almost\nlevel off towards 0 K. The echo signal is recovered and\nstabilized below TC2 .\nThe huge elastic softenings and the ultrasonic absorp-\n\nAuthor Name\n\n3\n\ntion of C44 in phase II are different from the critical\nbehaviors observed in the vicinity of a structural phase\ntransition temperature induced by either ferroquadrupolar ordering (e.g., DyB6 , HoB6 21) ) or the cooperative\nJahn-Teller effect (e.g., DyVO4 22) ). On the other hand,\nit has been known that large elastic softenings and ultrasonic absorptions in an ordered state arise from magnetic\nand structural domain-wall stress effects.23) However, in\nDyB4 , no symmetry reductions of the crystal and magnetic structure at the transition from phase II to phase\nIII were observed in the neutron diffraction study.18)\nTherefore, the elastic instability observed in only phase II\nof DyB4 also cannot be explained by domain-wall stress\neffects. Hence, we conclude that the attenuation of the\necho signal of elastic constants in phase II of DyB4 is\ncaused by quadrupolar fluctuations and that the orbital\ndegeneracy is still conserved in phase II. This is consistent with the results of the magnetic entropy change. On\nthe contrary, the elastic behaviors in phase III of DyB4\nindicate that the degeneracy of the orbital degrees of\nfreedom is lifted and the quadrupolar fluctuations disappear. Consequently, quadrupolar ordering and antiferromagnetic ordering may coexist below TC2 .\nHereafter, we focus on the quadrupolar instability in\nphase II of DyB4 , and we hypothesize that the quadrupolar fluctuations in DyB4 can be caused by a frustration in\nthe 4f orbital (quadrupolar) system of DyB4 . In the following, we consider two possible origins of the quadrupolar frustration in DyB4 . The first is based on a competition between the quadrupole-quadrupole interactions on\nthe SSL formed by Dy3+ ions in the xy-layer. An elementary unit model of the SSL for the nearest-neighbor\ninteractions is shown in Fig. 4 (c). If the coupling K\nis of antiferro-type, the quadrupolar system is frustrated\nregardless of the sign of the coupling K \u2032 , as in a spin system. The second is that the uniaxial anisotropy effects of\nthe 4f orbitals compete with the ferroquadrupolar interactions. The single ion anisotropy of the 4f orbital probably reflects the local environment of the rare-earth site\nthrough 4f electron-lattice coupling and/or CEF effects.\nThe local symmetry C2v of the Dy site is characterized by\na twofold axis (z \u2032 -axis in Fig. 4 (a)) lying in the xy-plane.\nBecause the site symmetry of the Dy site is uniaxial, it\nis reasonable to assume that the quadrupolar anisotropy\nis also uniaxial. The most important point to note is the\ngeometrical arrangement of the twofold axis at the Dy\nsite. In Figs. 4 (b) and 4 (c), the twofold axes at the Dy\nsites are represented by arrows. The two twofold axes of\na Dy-pair coupled by the K-bond are collinear and the\ndirections are antiparallel to each other. In contrast, the\narrows between the pairs are orthogonal to each other.\nIf only the single-ion anisotropy of Dy3+ is considered,\n4f orbitals on the neighboring sites are orthogonal to\neach other. Therefore, the single-ion anisotropy effects of\nthe 4f orbital in DyB4 compete with the ferroquadrupolar interactions. In addition, the present results that \u0398\nare comparable to EJT suggest that this competition is\nstrong in DyB4 . Accordingly, it can be expected that the\nquadrupolar system of DyB4 is geometrically frustrated\nand shows a quadrupolar instability. It can be said that\nthis quadrupolar frustration model is similar to the spin-\n\n\f4\n\nJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nFull Paper\n\nFig. 4. (a) Local structure of Dy3+ ion in DyB4 .

The twofold axes of the\nlocal symmetry at the Dy sites are represented by the arrows.\n(c) Interactions of the elementary unit of the SSL.\n\nice model which shows that strong geometrical frustration can arise in presence of the dominant ferromagnetic\ninteractions and local Ising anisotropy.6, 7) We obtained\nthe result that predominant quadrupolar interactions in\nDyB4 are of ferro-type. However, these results can be obtained if the coupling K \u2032 and the interlayer interactions\nare ferro-type because \u03b8 is only a mean value of the interaction. At present, the information is insufficient to\nconclude which origin of the frustration is more credible.\nIn the following, we compare DyB4 and RB2 C (R =\nDy and Ho) in which the rare-earth ions also form the\nSSL. DyB2 C and HoB2 C show a three-dimensional magnetic order but MRL states still remain below TC .10) The\nmagnetic ordering temperatures of RB2 C (R = Dy, Ho,\nand Er) do not follow the de Gennes relation. This fact\nsuggests that the ordering temperatures of DyB2 C and\nHoB2 C are suppressed. The unconventional fluctuating\nground states and the suppressions of the ordering temperatures of DyB2 C and HoB2 C are due to spin frustration effects. In DyB4 , however, the large magnetic fluctuations such as those observed in DyB2 C and HoB2 C\nwere not recognized from the results of powder neutron\ndiffraction measurement18) ; this is consistent with the\nresults of the inverse magnetic susceptibilities. Consequently, it is thought that the influence of spin frustration\non the magnetic transition temperature is very small in\nthis compound. It seems that the quadrupolar system of\nDyB4 is strongly influenced by a geometrical quadrupolar frustration and that the quadrupolar ordering is suppressed.\nMost of the compounds with spin frustration show\nlong-range order in the lowest-temperature phase. However, a spin frustration system increases the degree of\norder through successive phase transitions accompanied\nby high-entropy intermediate states with spin fluctuation, because the energy gain of the spin-spin correlation is suppressed by the spin frustration. For example,\na partial disorder and an order of limited components of\nspins are generally observed in triangular lattice antiferromagnets such as CsCoCl3 and CsNiCl3 .1\u20135) CsNiCl3\nexhibits successive phase transitions similar to those of\n\nAuthor Name\n\nDyB4 , where the parallel and perpendicular components\nto the c-axis of Ni2+ moments order at TN1 = 4.8 K and\nTN2 = 4.4 K, respectively. In this material, the large difference between the Weiss temperature \u03b8p = \u221269 K and\nTN1 is attributed to the spin frustration.5) On the other\nhand, in DyB4 , the successive phase transitions characterized by a magnetic ordering of the z and xy components at independent temperatures are not caused by\nspin frustration. The quadrupole moments and the xy\ncomponents of the magnetic moments order at TC2 simultaneously. The quadrupolar interactions most likely\nplay a dominant role in the phase transition at TC2 , and\nthe ordering of the xy components of the magnetic moments coupled with the quadrupole ones can be induced\nby the ordering of the quadrupole moments. At present,\nhowever, it is unclear why the phase transition at TC2 is\nnot a first-order but a second-order transition. Accordingly, we conclude that the successive phase transitions\nin DyB4 are caused by the coexistence of quadrupolar\nfrustration and the quadrupolar entropy effect.\nIn summary, we observed successive phase transition at\nTC1 = 20.3 K and TC2 = 12.7 K in DyB4 . The successive\nphase transitions are characterized by a magnetic ordering of the z and xy components at independent temperatures. The magnetic entropy change indicates that the\ndegeneracy of the internal degrees of freedom in phase\nII is still conserved in spite of the formation of magnetic\norder. The huge softening of C44 and the attenuation in\nphase II suggest the existence of quadrupolar fluctuations. These unusual properties originate from a geometrical quadrupolar frustration.\nWe are grateful to T. Sakakibara, J. Custers, and\nN. Todoroki for their helpful discussions.\n\n1) M. Mekata: J. Magn.
