Under such conditions although\nthe low-energy features in momentum space are sharp,\nthe spectral function, considered as function of energy\nfor fixed momentum can be broad [6,9].\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThere is strong evidence, in part based on careful analysis of single particle spectral functions deduced from\nangle resolved photoemission (ARPES), that the normal state of the high temperature superconductors is not\na conventional Fermi liquid. At the same time, there\nis clear evidence that in some, and possibly in all of\nthese materials, there are local, self-organized quasi-onedimensional structures, \"stripes\", which substantially affect the electron dynamics. Many striking features of the\nARPES spectrum have a natural interpretation in terms\nof an electronic structure dominated by stripes [1\u20136].\nOne such feature, which is reproduced in Fig. 1, is that\nthe low-energy spectral weight lies predominantly in regions of the Brillouin zone (BZ) in the vicinity of the\n(\u00b1\u03c0, 0) and (0, \u00b1\u03c0) points. (These are often referred to\nas the \"anti-nodal regions\" as this is where the maximum\nin the d-wave superconducting gap occurs.) These regions have very straight boundaries which run parallel to\nthe momentum axes and are displaced by approximately\n\u00b1\u03c0/4 from them. This spectral weight has been interpreted in terms of quarter filled stripes (so kF = \u03c0/4)\nalong the a and b directions of the lattice [1,4,7].\nHowever, a number of features of the ARPES\ndata are inconsistent with the most naive picture\nof an array of strictly one-dimensional quarter filled\nstripes. Of these, the most obvious is the occurrence of features, especially in the \"nodal regions\"\nof the BZ [around (\u00b1\u03c0/2, \u00b1\u03c0/2)], which are reminiscent of the underlying, two dimensional band structure. An example is the appearance of low-energy spectral weight along segments parallel to the lines connecting the anti-nodal points in La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 (LSCO)\nand La1.6\u2212x Nd0.4 Srx CuO4 (LNSCO). A similar signature\nalso appears in Pb-doped Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8+\u03b4 (BSCCO),\nas shown in Fig. 1.\nIt is the principal purpose of this paper to elucidate\nhow this apparently two-dimensional structure arises naturally from a slightly more sophisticated analysis of the\nband-structure of a stripy system. In doing so we extend the initial work of Ref. 1 and complement a recent study of the effects of realistic band parameters on\nthe spectrum by Fleck, Pavarini and Andersen [8]. We\n\nOur results are easily summarized. We have computed\nthe band-structure of electrons in the potential generated by a typical configuration of the \"slow\" collective\nfields that define the stripe order. (The explicit Hamiltonian is presented in Section II.) Figs. 2 and 3 depict\nthe ~k space distribution of low-energy spectral intensity\nin the first BZ for disordered and ordered arrays of parallel stripes, respectively. In both cases most of the lowenergy spectral weight is concentrated in the anti-nodal\nregions. However, while the ordered stripe array exhibits\na spectral gap in the nodal region, the disordered array\nhas low-energy weight there, much like that seen in experiment.\nWe picture the disordered array as being a \"snapshot\"\nof a \"fluctuating stripe array,\" although it could also\nreflect the effect of quenched disorder. The low-energy\nelectronic states that are responsible for its spectral map,\nshown in Fig. 2, lie within the Mott gap. They are bound\nstates that decay exponentially in the direction perpendicular to the stripes. However, they are extended along\nthe stripes, so the low energy electron dynamics is strictly\none-dimensional. The resulting band-structure, which is\nshown in Fig. 5, is, to a good approximation, a superposition of the band-structures of single isolated stripes and\nof small clusters (typically pairs) of proximate stripes.\nThe band-structure and spectral distribution of a single stripe are shown in Figs. 6 and 7. Here, the fact\nthat the electron wavefunctions in the gap have a nonnegligible extent transverse to the stripe can be seen to\nproduce an image of the full two-dimensional band structure. However, as is apparent from the spectrum, unless\nan isolated stripe is nearly half-filled (which is physically\nimplausible), it will not have any low-energy spectral\nweight near (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2). This is the reason for the absence\nof spectral weight in the nodal region of the ordered ar1\n\n\fray since its wavefunctions are Bloch states constructed\nfrom single stripe bound states.\n\nII. THE MODEL\n\nIn the disordered array of stripes, the spectral weight in\nthe nodal regions originates primarily from anomalously\nclose pairs of stripes. This is demonstrated in Figs. 910, which show that for an isolated bi-stripe, there is\nlow-energy spectral weight in the vicinity of (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2),\neven when the stripes are roughly quarter filled. The\nidea that the intensity of the nodal spectral weight is related to the degree of stripe disorder [7] conforms with\nthe experimental finding (see Fig. 1) of more pronounced\nFermi segments in the nodal direction in optimally doped\nLSCO, where the stripes do not statically order, than in\nLNSCO, where long-range stripe order is seen in neutron\ndiffraction [10]. Several other experimental observations\ncan be understood in terms of our results, as discussed\nin Sec. VI.\n\nSince the high temperature superconductors are doped\nantiferromagnets, it is reasonable to expect slow fluctuations of a collective field representing the local staggered\nmagnetization. One can think of this field as resulting\nfrom a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation of the interacting many-body problem. However, we do not solve\na Hartree-Fock theory for this field, i.e., we do not find\nthe configuration that minimizes the Hartree-Fock energy. Instead we take as a minimal model a set of noninteracting electrons on a square lattice interacting with\na static, staggered field which represents a characteristic\n\"snapshot\" of the field configuration:\nH =\u2212\n\nWhen residual interactions between electrons on a\nstripe are considered, each non-interacting localized band\ngives rise to a one-dimensional Luttinger liquid. As in the\nnon-interacting case the two-dimensional ~k space structure, and especially the Fermi surface, remain prominent\nfeatures of the low-energy spectral response. However,\nalong a cut in the BZ perpendicular to the Fermi surface, the spectral function mimics Luttinger liquid behavior. (See, e.g., the behavior along the nodal direction in Fig. 11. ) This justifies the application of onedimensional physics along directions that are not necessarily aligned with the stripes, as was done recently in\nRef. 6.\n\n+\n\nX\n\n(c\u2020x,y,\u03c3 cx+1,y,\u03c3 + c\u2020x,y,\u03c3 cx,y+1,\u03c3 + H.C.)\n\nX\n\n\u03c3(\u22121)x+y m(x, y)c\u2020x,y,\u03c3 cx,y,\u03c3 ,\n\nx,y,\u03c3\n\n(1)\n\nx,y,\u03c3\n\nwhere cx,y,\u03c3 is the electron destruction operator at site\n(x, y) and spin \u03c3 = \u00b1 and we have chosen units such\nthat the hopping matrix element and the lattice constant\nequal 1. Specifically, we consider the simplest possible\nansatz to represent stripe configurations in which\nm(x, y) = m\n\nY\nxs\n\n\u0398(x \u2212 xs ) ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere m is a constant, {xs } are a given set of positions\nof anti-phase domain walls, and where \u0398 is the antisymmetric step-function: \u0398(x) = \u2212\u0398(\u2212x) = 1 for x > 0\nand \u0398(0) = 0. This corresponds to an array of perfectly\nstraight, site centered stripes of width one oriented in\nthe y direction. Depending on the choice of the set {xs }\nthe potential can either be regular or disordered in the\ntransverse (x) direction.\nSome features of the solution below do depend on details of this choice, such as whether the stripes are site\nor bond centered, whether they are of width 1 or wider,\nwhether we include an additional collective field that couples to the charge density [1], etc.; effects that we have\nexplored, to some extent. However, the important qualitative physics is apparent in this simplest of models, so\nwe only report results for this model. Two more serious\nomissions, which are beyond the scope of the present paper, are the neglect of effects of the dynamical character\nof the collective fields, and the neglect of any shape deformations of the stripe order. The latter approximation\nimplies that the electronic states are Bloch waves in the\ny direction, with a wave-vector, ky , which is conserved\nmod \u03c0 (due to the presence of the staggered field).\nWithout the domain walls the system has an energy\ngap\n\u221a of magnitude 2m and two bands with energies E =\n\u00b1 m2 + \u01eb2 , with \u01eb = \u22122[cos(kx ) + cos(ky )]. An isolated\n\nIt is important to stress that we view the present results as reliable for exploring the qualitative effects of\nstripes on electronic structure, but not as a realistic study\nof the cuprate superconductors. The parameters in our\nmodel have not been carefully adjusted to optimize any\nsort of fit to the data. We have certainly not included any\n\"realistic\" band-structure effects, such as second neighbor hopping, t\u2032 , nor, except in Sec. V, considered any\nstrong correlation effects, other than the stripes themselves. Phonons, dynamical stripe fluctuations, effects of\ntransverse deformations of the stripe potential, dynamical magnetic fluctuations, and all other forms of of static\nor dynamical disorder are neglected in our calculations.\nThey will all certainly have important consequences for\nthe details of the measured electronic structures. However, it should also be stressed that, throughout this paper, we will be concerned with intermediate energies and\nlength scales. Thus, for our purposes, the distinction\nbetween long-range and mesoscale stripe order, and between static and fluctuating stripes is unimportant, although of course these distinctions are essential at low\nenergies and long wave-lengths.\n\n2\n\n\fdomain wall generates mid-gap states which are localized in the direction orthogonal to the wall, as is shown\nanalytically, below.\nFor an array of domain walls, it would be exceedingly\ndifficult to find analytic solutions for the mid-gap states.\nInstead we diagonalize such systems numerically for a\ngiven realization of the model. In each case, we take\nm = 1 which corresponds to an \"intermediate coupling\"\nvalue of the ratio of the energy gap to the band-width\nof 2/8=1/4. We study systems with finite width, Lx , in\nthe x direction where typically Lx = 320; according to\nall tests we have applied, this is large enough to eliminate most finite size effects. Since ky is a good quantum\nnumber, the only place the finite size in the y direction\nenters our calculations is when we perform sums over ky ;\nhere, it is easy to show that the system sizes we have considered, Ly = 320, are more than adequate to eliminate\nfinite size effects.\n\nIII. BAND\u2013STRUCTURE OF A STRIPE ARRAY\n\nIn this section, we consider the spectral weight distribution and band structure of a stripe array. If one ignores details concerning the matrix elements describing\nthe photo-excitation process one can infer directly the\nsingle-particle spectral function, A(~k, \u03c9), from ARPES.\nFor non-interacting electrons, A(~k, \u03c9) can be expressed\nin terms of the exact single particle energy eigenstates\n\u03a8\u03b1 (~r) and energies E\u03b1 :\nA(~k, \u03c9) = (Lx Ly )\u22121\n\nX\n\n~\n\nFIG. 1.

In Fig. 2, we do the\nsame for an array with a distribution of stripe spacings\nchosen randomly between 1 and 7, i.e., a flat distribution\nwith mean l = 4. In both cases, we have fixed \u03bc such\nthat the average electron density per site is 1 \u2212 \u03b4 where\n\u03b4 = 1/2l. (\u03b4 is known as the density of \"doped holes.\")\nThis corresponds on the average to quarter filled stripes,\nsuch that for l = 4 we obtain \u03b4 = 1/8. In these figures,\nwe have chosen \u2206\u03c9 = 0.2, but the qualitative character\nof the distribution is not highly sensitive to this choice.\nThe data for the disordered array is for a given realization\nof the stripe distribution, but the system is large enough\nthat the results are self averaging in the sense that the\ncorresponding figures look similar to the eye for different\nrealizations.\n\nIn order to characterize the momentum distribution of\nthe low-energy spectral weight and reveal features such\nas the Fermi surface, it is appropriate to integrate the\nspectral function over a narrow energy window below the\nchemical potential \u03bc\nI(~k) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03bc\n\nA(~k, \u03c9)d\u03c9 .\n\n(4)\n\n\u03bc\u2212\u2206\u03c9\n\nThe experimental data in Fig. 1 and the theoretical results in later figures are expressed in this way.\n3\n\n\fFIG. 2.\na) The low-energy spectral weight in the first\nquadrant of the Brillouin zone integrated over an energy interval \u2206\u03c9 = 0.2 below \u03bc for a disordered stripe array with\nmean spacing l = 4 and m = 1 at \u03b4 = 1/8 doping. The system size is 320 \u00d7 320 and the amplitude color is coded from\nblue through green to red, as in Fig. 1. b) Typical electron\ndensity profile of the array as a function of x (perpendicular to\nthe stripe axis). While some of the dips correspond to stripe\npositions, others, such as the one at x \u2248 53, correspond to\nbi-stripes. Thus, in comparison to Fig. 3, below, the density\nof dips is smaller although the density of stripes is the same.\n\nFIG. 3. Same as in Fig. 2 but for an ordered stripe array\nwith l = 4, \u03b4 = 1/8 and \u2206\u03c9 = 0.2.\n\nThese results demonstrate that two-dimensional structures, including an apparent Fermi surface, can appear in\nthe ARPES data of a system which is dynamically onedimensional. It is also noteworthy that y directed stripes\nnot only lead to substantial low energy spectral weight\nin the anti-nodal region near (0, \u03c0), as naively expected,\nbut also in the reciprocal region, near (\u03c0, 0), as well.\n(This observation is important in systems with macroscopic stripe orientational order, including, potentially,\nYBCO [12].) We also note that for the ordered array,\nthere are oscillations in the spectral weight as a function\nof kx . It is apparent from Fig. 3 that these oscillations reflect the periodicity of the array (2\u03c0/4 = \u03c0/2 in this case.\nWe have checked [13] that for longer period arrays, for\nexample with l = 6, the period of these oscillations shifts\naccordingly.) That such oscillations have been observed\nin LNSCO [4] further corroborates the stripe interpretation of the results.\n\nClearly, a number of salient features of the low-energy\nspectral weight of these various stripe arrays are reminiscent of those measured in ARPES. In particular the\ndisordered array, Fig. 2, looks strikingly like the corresponding spectrum in LSCO. In both cases, most of the\nspectral weight is in a broad, flat region close to the (\u03c0, 0)\npoint with a fainter image near (0, \u03c0). For the ordered\narray this exhausts the low-energy spectral weight, but\nfor the disordered array, as in the experiments, a small\namount of spectral weight lies along what would have\nbeen the band-structure Fermi surface in the nodal region. (Of course, in order to compare the results more\nclosely with the ARPES measurements we should symmetrize these results around ky = kx to allow for stripes\nrunning in both directions in different domains.)\n4\n\n\fa large number of stripes, so we have purposely reduced\nthe system size to Lx = 80 and the energy window to\n|E| < 2 for graphical clarity. We devote the next section\nto a closer examination of this band-structure.\n\nFIG. 5. Band-structure of a disordered array with mean\nstripe spacing l = 4 and m = 1. \u03bc is the T = 0 chemical\npotential for a density of doped holes \u03b4 = 1/8. The system\nsize is 80\u00d7320\n\nFIG. 4. The squared magnitude of the Fourier transform of\nthe field m(x, y) for a disordered array of size Lx = 100, 000.\nThis quantity is proportional to the spin-spin correlation function measured by neutron scattering.\n\nBecause for each value of ky , the effective Hamiltonian is that of a one-dimensional disordered system in\nthe x direction, we know a priori that all the states are\nexponentially localized transverse to the stripes. However, for the states that lie within the Mott gap, |E| <\nm = 1, one might expect the states to be highly localized in the neighborhood of one or two stripes, while for\n|E| > m = 1, the states are more likely extended scattering states, that are only weakly localized. That this\nexpectation is realized can be seen in at least three ways.\nIt is clear from Fig. 5, that there is a dense set of states\nat E > m = 1, whereas for E < m = 1 there is a spider\nweb of identifiable one-dimensional bands; the discreteness of these bands is a reflection of their large degree of\nlocalization in the transverse direction. By plotting the\nstates in real space along x we have confirmed that all\nthe states in the gap decay exponentially in a few lattice\nconstants, whereas the scattering states are essentially\ndelocalized. P\nFinally, we have computed the participation\nratio, P\u03b1 \u2261 ~r |\u03a8\u03b1 (~r)|4 \u2248 (2\u03be)\u22121 , where \u03be is the localization length. For a system of size 320 \u00d7 320, we find P s\nfor the states with |E| > m of order P \u223c 1/100 (which\nmight get even smaller for larger system sizes), while for\n|E| < m, typically P \u2248 0.1 \u2212 0.25. For moderate doping\n\u03b4 the Fermi energy always lies inside the set of highly\nlocalized bands. (See for example, Fig. 5 where the value\nof the Fermi energy corresponding to \u03b4 = 1/8 is indicated.) It is clear that all of the spectral weight shown in\nFig. 2 comes from these localized, and hence dynamically\nentirely one-dimensional states.\n\nWe have also calculated the electronic density distributions of the disordered and ordered arrays and they\nare shown next to the spectral maps in Figs. 2 and 3.\nWe see that in the ordered case, the density modulations\nhave the same periodicity as the stripe potential, but in\nthe disordered array, the mean spacing between troughs\n(or peaks) of the density is larger than the mean spacing\nbetween stripes. This reflects the fact that only a single\ndensity depression occurs where two stripes are close together. To demonstrate this fact and make connection\nwith neutron diffraction experiments, we have computed\nstructure factors from the Fourier transforms of the densities of electronic charge (\u03c1) and z-spin component of the\nspin (Sz ). For the ordered array of period 4 the charge\nsignal is strongly peaked at kx = 0 with a small satellite\nat kx = \u03c0/2 and the spin signal is peaked at kx = 3\u03c0/4\nand kx = 5\u03c0/4. For the disordered array the charge and\nspin peaks are shifted towards kx = 0 and kx = \u03c0 respectively. In Fig. 4 we show the Fourier transform of\nthe autocorrelation function of the random field m. (We\nshow the results for m rather than for Sz , because it can\nbe computed for very large arrays, where the result is\nself-averaging. However, we have verified that the two\nquantities give similar results [13].) The fact that for\nthe disordered array, the spin peaks are not only broadened, but are shifted towards the (\u03c0, \u03c0) point seems to\nbe generic behavior for disordered arrays.\nSince ky is still a good quantum number, we can still\ntalk about a (one-dimensional) band-structure of the disordered array, as shown in Fig. 5. However, as there are\nprecisely 2Lx bands, this figure becomes rather dense for\n5\n\n\fmid-gap band has energy zero precisely where ky = \u03c0/2,\nso that for a hole-doped stripe, for which the Fermi energy will certainly lie at negative energies, there will never\nbe low-energy spectral weight at the nodal point. A\ngeneric feature of the spectral weight distribution that\nis apparent in the figure is the fact that the negative energy states have more weight in the lower-half of the first\nquadrant of the BZ than in the upper-half. This feature\nis seen very clearly also in the disordered array problem\n(Fig. 2).\n\nIV. ISOLATED STRIPES AND BI-STRIPES\n\nIn order to get a better understanding of the nature\nof the localized states and how they give rise to the\nvery characteristic two-dimensional distribution of spectral weight, we look at some simpler problems consisting\nof a single or a pair of proximate domain walls.\nConsider the situation in which the defects, i.e., one or\nmore stripes, are confined to a region about x = 0. It is\nstraightforward to explicitly write the wavefunctions for\nfixed ky in the asymptotic regions to the left and right\nof the defect; the eigenvalue problem is then solved by\nmatching these solutions across the defect region. For\n|E| < m, the asymptotic states are exponentially falling\nfunctions of x. For instance, to the right of the defect,\nthe Hamiltonian (1) is diagonalized by\ni\nh\n(5)\n\u03c6ky (x, y) = e\u2212\u03bax ei(qx+ky y) 1 + ei\u03b1 ei\u03c0(x+y) ,\nwhere the quantities \u03ba, q, and \u03b1 are the implicit functions\nof ky and the energy E which (for \u03c3 = 1) satisfy\n0 = cos(q) cosh(\u03ba) + cos(ky ) ,\nE 2 = m2 \u2212 4 sinh2 (\u03ba) sin2 (q) ,\n\nei\u03b1 = [E + 2i sinh(\u03ba) sin(q)]/m .\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nFIG. 6. Dispersion E(ky ) of the bound states of a single\nanti-phase domain wall with m = 1.\n\n(8)\n\nIt follows from Eqs. 6-8 that if (5) is a solution then so\nis (5) with q \u2192 \u2212q, \u03b1 \u2192 \u2212\u03b1 and the same energy. Thus\nthe total wavefunction \u03a6ky (x, y) is a linear superposition\nof the two. To the left of the defect the same equations\nhold after substituting \u03ba \u2192 \u2212\u03ba and, in the case of an\nanti-phase defect, m \u2192 \u2212m. A fourth equation, which\ndepends on the nature of the defect, is obtained by integrating the Schroedinger equation across the defect region and defines the eigenvalue problem, E = E(ky ). (If\nthe defect region is sufficiently broad, there may be multiple solutions to the eigenvalue equation, corresponding\nto multiple mid-gap bands.)\nMuch of the interesting physics is already implicit in\nthese relations. The distribution of spectral weight in\nthe two dimensional BZ associated with a state of given\ncrystal momentum ky is given by |\u03a8ky (kx )|2 , where \u03a8 is\nthe Fourier transform of \u03a6. Clearly, this weight is peaked\nnear kx = q(ky ) in a region of width \u2206kx \u2248 \u03ba(ky ). For\nsmall \u03ba, Eq. (6) implies that q(ky ) simply traces out the\nunderlying \"diamond\" Fermi surface given by the unperturbed band-structure.\nTo be explicit, let us consider the case of a single sitecentered anti-phase domain wall, (\u2193\u2191\u2193\u2191 * \u2193\u2191\u2193\u2191) of the\ntype which appears in Eq. (2). In this case, the eigenvalue equation is readily derived\n2\n\nE(ky ) = \u00b12 tanh (\u03ba) cos(ky ).\n\nFIG. 7. Integrated spectral weight over all negative (a) and\npositive (b) energy bound states of a single anti-phase domain\nwall with m = 1. The apparent discontinuity across ky = \u03c0/2\nis due to the band crossing.\n\nIt is particularly illuminating to examine this result in\nthe small m limit. The four implicit equations can be\nsolved to leading order in m to obtain (for 0 < ky < \u03c0)\nq(ky ) = \u03c0 \u2212 ky ,\nm\n\u03ba(ky ) =\n,\n2 sin(ky )\nE(ky ) = \u00b12\u03ba2 (ky ) cos(ky ) .\n\n(10)\n(11)\n(12)\n\nAs advertised, q(ky ) precisely traces out the diamond\nFermi surface. \u03ba\u22121 (ky ) \u223c vF (ky )/m is the extent of the\nwavefunction in real space, implying that |\u03a8ky (kx )|2 is\nquite sharply peaked near kx = q(ky ) in the nodal regions, where the Fermi velocity, vF , is large, and is much\n\n(9)\n\nThe resulting band-structure and spectral weight distribution in the BZ is shown in Figs. 6 and 7. Note that the\n6\n\n\fmore diffused in the anti-nodal regions, where vF \u2192 0.\n(Where vF =\n\u221a 0, the expression for \u03ba breaks down and\nwe find \u03ba \u223c m.) These features are, to a large extent,\nindependent of the nature of the defect, so long as m is\nnot too large. It is also worth noting that the energy\nwidth of the mid-gap band is of order m2 , although the\ngap itself is 2m, and hence much larger.\nThe single anti-phase domain wall solution captures\nmost of the general features of the array of domain walls:\nThe spectral weight is concentrated about the diamond\nFermi surface, it is largest in a broad anti-nodal region,\nand is larger in the lower-half than in the upper-half of\nthe BZ quadrant. Indeed, the low-energy spectral distribution of the ordered stripe arrays is, to first approximation, simply the sum of contributions of isolated stripes,\neven when the stripe spacing is only four lattice constants.\nHowever, the disordered stripe array is not simply a superposition of single wall states, especially in the nodal\nregion. In fact, while it is clear from the band-structure\nof the disordered array shown in Fig. 5, that a large fraction of the mid-gap bands are very similar to the mid-gap\nband of a single isolated stripe (Fig. 6), there are other\nbands, especially those that dominate the spectrum at\nky = \u03c0/2 and E near \u03bc, that look very different.\nGuided by the observation that the nodal weight is\nmissing for an ordered array, it is reasonable to assume\nthat this feature is related to local configurations with\ntwo or more domain walls in close proximity. Consider\ntherefore the problem of two anti-phase domain walls in\nclose proximity. Clearly, the statement of proximity is\nrelated to the decay length \u03be = 1/\u03ba of the single domain wall problem. If the distance between the walls is\ngreater than \u03be, the walls can be considered independent,\nwhile for smaller distances they interfere. For m = 1 we\nfind 1/\u03ba \u2248 2 and only weakly dependent on ky , implying\nthat domain walls separated by more then two sites are\nroughly independent. Fig. 8 shows the energy spectrum\nfor the bound states of two anti-phase domain walls separated by one site. The spectrum is gapped and it is clear\nthat doping such a system can give rise to low-energy\nspectral weight around ky = \u03c0/2. In Fig. 9 we repeat the\nsame calculation for two proximate stripes.\nParticularly interesting is the distribution of spectral\nweight in momentum space for this system as shown in\nFigure 10. As with the single wall problem, the weight\nhovers around the band-structure Fermi surface, but with\nthe distinct feature that the weight of the negative energy states is shifted towards the zone center whereas\nthe positive energy states are shifted towards the (\u03c0, \u03c0)\npoint. We find that the magnitude of this shift increases\nwith m. Intuitively it is of course not surprising that the\nnegative energy states are shifted towards the zone center\nwhere the tight-binding energies are lower and conversely\nfor the positive energy states.\n\nFIG. 8.

INCLUDING INTERACTIONS\n\nSo far we have been concerned with the distribution of\nspectral weight in the non-interacting model defined in\nEq. (1) when holes are introduced into its single-particle\nlevels. Including the effects of interactions between electrons in a doped stripe is a natural extension of this\n7\n\n\fmodel. In the following we consider this issue for the\ncase of the disordered stripe array.\nTo the extent that the localized bands shown in Fig. 5\ncan be considered as independent we may calculate the\nlow-energy and long-wavelength spectral response of the\nsystem as a sum over interacting Luttinger liquid contributions A1d (k, \u03c9)\n\nA(~k, \u03c9) =\n\nX\nkF\n\n|\u03a8kF (kx )|2 A1d [ky \u2212 kF , \u03c9; \u03b3(kF )] . (13)\n\nHere the sum runs over the localized bands that cross\nthe Fermi energy. Every crossing point is a Fermi point\nkF \u2261 ~kF * \u0177 for the one-dimensional channel defined by\nthe band. Each channel is also characterized by the kx\nprofile of its wavefunction \u03a8kF (kx ) and its Luttinger parameters Kc,s and velocities vc,s which are collectively\ndenoted as \u03b3(kF ) in (13).\nThe evaluation of the spectral function (13) simplifies\nin the small m limit where the spectral weight is concentrated (within a width of order m) along the diagonal connecting the anti-nodal points and is roughly constant. The total spectral function is then proportional to\nA1d (kx + ky \u2212 \u03c0, \u03c9; \u03b3), where we have assumed that \u03b3 is\nthe same for all bands. As we see, in this case, the spectral function exhibits one-dimensional behavior over the\nentire BZ. This description is valid as long as the stripe\narray is sufficiently dilute such that the overlaps between\ndifferent localized bands are small.\n\nFIG. 11. a) The zero-temperate spectral function A(k, \u03c9)\ncalculated from Eq. (13) assuming a Lorentzian distribution of spectral weight centered on a line parallel to\nthe anti-diagonal.\nHere vc = vs = 1, Ks = 1,\n\u03b3c = (Kc + Kc\u22121 \u2212 2)/8 = 0.3 and \u03ba = 0.5 (which is what we\nfind for a single stripe with m = 1.) k is measured along the\nBZ diagonal and relative to the Fermi point near (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2),\n\u03c9 is measured relative to the chemical potential \u03bc. b) MDC\nat \u03c9 = 0, c) EDC at k = 0.\n\nThe spectral function in Fig. 11 shows a close resemblance to one-dimensional spectral functions (compare\nfor example with Ref. 6). In particular it exhibits a striking dichotomy between sharp MDCs (momentum distribution curves - cuts at constant \u03c9) and broad EDCs (energy distribution curves - cuts at constant k), which we\nbelieve is a telltale of electron fractionalization [6]. It is\ninteresting to note, however, that A(~k, \u03c9) in Fig. 11 is\nsmoother than the corresponding zero-temperature onedimensional spectral function and does not diverge at\n\u03c9 = vk for k < 0 like the latter. This divergency is\nsmeared by the convolution in Eq. (13) and the result\nis a spectral function that resembles A1d (k, \u03c9) but at a\nfinite temperature.\nThe present analysis is the first which combines\nthe remarkable non-Fermi liquid features of the onedimensional electron gas with the two-dimensional structure of a Fermi surface. At a qualitative level, it justifies\nthe analysis presented in Ref. 6, in which the measured\nspectral functions of the high temperature superconductors was analyzed in terms of the corresponding expressions for a one-dimensional Luttinger liquid. In particu-\n\nFor intermediate values of m performing the convolution in (13) is difficult owing to the complicated distribution of the low-energy spectral weight in momentum\nspace. However, the spectral function continues to mimic\none-dimensional behavior along directions that are not\nnecessarily aligned with the stripes. To demonstrate this\npoint we consider the spectral function along a cut in the\nBZ that runs in the nodal direction [from (0, 0) to (\u03c0, \u03c0)].\nSince the zero-temperature A1d (k\u2212kF , \u03c9; \u03b3) vanishes unless |\u03c9| > min(vc , vs )|k\u2212kF | [6] it is clear that the important contribution to A(~k, \u03c9) along this cut, and at low energies, comes from bands that cross the Fermi energy near\nky = \u03c0/2. Moreover, we have shown that these bands\nproduce spectral weight that is concentrated along a line\nparallel to the anti-diagonal [(\u03c0, 0) to (0, \u03c0)]. Therefore,\nfor our purpose, we may approximate the spectral distribution by a Lorentzian distribution centered on this\nline with half-width at half-maximum of \u03ba. In Fig. 11 we\npresent the spectral function which results from Eq. (13)\nunder the assumption of such weight distribution.\n8\n\n\flar, we have presented here a microscopic rationale, which\nwas missing at the time of that earlier work, for the existence of approximate one-dimensional dynamics in the\nnodal region of the Fermi surface.\n\nconcentration so as to accommodate the added charges\nin mid-gap states. This is a form of \"topological doping\"\n[20] analogous to soliton doping of polyacetylene [21]. As\nis the case in polyacetylene, we expect a variety of additional aspects of topological doping to be manifest in\nexperiments on the cuprates, including dopant induced\nmid-gap optical absorption [1,3], dopant induced infrared active phonon modes [22], etc.\nFinally, the observation that the structure factor of a\ndisordered stripe array exhibits incommensurate peaks\nthat are not only broadened by disorder, but also shifted\nto smaller incommensurability (Fig. 4) may have other\ninteresting implications. Inelastic neutron scattering experiments in LNSCO [10], LSCO [23] and YBCO [24]\nreveal incommensurate magnetic peaks displaced from\nthe antiferromagnetic wave vector, (\u03c0, \u03c0), by an amount\nwhich first grows roughly linearly with doping, but then\ntends to saturate (typically beyond \u03b4 = 1/8). This is generally taken as evidence that the concentration stripes,\nlikewise, first increases linearly and then saturates. Our\npresent results suggest that, at least in part, the saturation of the incommensurability may reflect increasingly\nstrong stripe fluctuations, rather than a sudden saturation of the stripe concentration.\n\nVI. FURTHER CONSEQUENCES\n\nIn addition to the gross similarities between the experimentally observed spectral functions in LSCO, LNSCO\nand BSCCO and those obtained from simple stripe models, there are a number of other aspects of the present\nresults that are potentially relevant to the interpretation\nof experiment.\nA phenomenon that is fairly generally observed in\nARPES measurements on high temperature superconductors is that a sharp quasi-particle like peak appears\nin the spectrum in the anti-nodal regions as the temperature is reduced below Tc . Recent experiments on untwinned YBa2 Cu3 O7\u2212\u03b4 (YBCO) crystals have found that\nthe spectral-weight of this sharp feature exhibits strong\nanisotropy between the different anti-nodal regions of the\nBZ [12]. There are good empirical [14,15] and theoretical\n[16] reasons to believe that the stripes in this material\nare partially oriented by the chain potential on the Cu-O\nplanes. Thus, a large anisotropy in plane-related features is to be expected. Moreover, we have previously\nshown [5] that the emergence of such a peak is naturally\nexplained as a dimensional crossover in a quasi-one dimensional superconductor. However, the presence of lowenergy spectral weight in the anti-nodal region transverse\nto the stripes seems surprising at first. Nevertheless, as\nnoted above, stripes induce low-energy spectral weight in\nboth anti-nodal regions, although with different spectral\nweights - this is a consequence of strong mixing between\nstates separated by the antiferromagnetic wave-vector,\n(\u03c0, \u03c0). The observed anisotropy is reproduced naturally\nby the present model - see Fig. 2.\nOne would generally expect electrons diffracting off an\nordered stripe array to exhibit intensity modulations with\nthe corresponding period, as indeed is apparent in the\nperiod \u03c0/2 structure seen in Fig. 3. We believe, in agreement with the interpretation proposed Zhou et al. [4],\nthat this effect has already been seen in ARPES spectra\nof LNSCO [4]. Since all previous observations of chargedensity wave ordering are indirect (e.g. they detect the\naccompanying lattice distortion density wave), this observation is potentially of more far reaching importance\nas a method for detecting charge order.\nExperiments on both electron and hole-doped cuprates\nindicate that the chemical potential remains within the\nMott gap, and is a remarkably slowly varying function\nof dopant concentration; instead, new dopant induced\nstates appear in the gap [17\u201319]. Of course, this behavior is characteristic of the sort of stripe models envisaged\nhere, in which the density of stripes increases with dopant\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe would like to acknowledge helpful discussions with\nJ.
