Pinning occurs naturally via material inhomogeneity and\nmicrostructural defects, but can be enhanced through\nthe addition of artificial pinning centres, such as insulating particles within a YBCO matrix [1, 2, 3]. Here\nwe study whether magnetic artificial pinning centres can\nfurther improve Jc . A non-magnetic, insulating cylinder of radius \u03be (the coherence length of the superconductor) aligned with a vortex already appears optimal\nin that the full condensation energy of the vortex core\nis gained-leading to the strongest core pinning force-\nwith a minimum loss of superconducting material. Yet\nmany have suggested that the magnetic portion of the\nfree energy of a vortex offers another route to strengthen\npinning [4, 5, 6]. This premise was the basis for several experiments in which arrays of magnetic dots were\ncreated on top of a superconducting film, or a film was\ndeposited over such an array [7, 8, 9, 10].\nIn these previous experiments, the interaction between\nvortex and magnet falls into two categories, neither of\nwhich offers superior pinning to an ideal core pin. In\nthe first, a vortex interacts with the stray field of a magnetic dot. The resulting potential well for the vortex\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: rd356@cam.ac.uk\n\nmay be deep, but its width is governed by the penetration depth \u03bb, which in practical superconductors is\nrelatively large compared to \u03be, leading to a low pinning\nforce. The other interaction is the proximity effect, in\nwhich the magnet suppresses superconductivity, which\nalso cannot improve upon an ideal core pin, where superconductivity is suppressed completely. Blamire et al.\n[11] therefore proposed that the greatest Jc enhancement\nwill arise not from altering the potential landscape of vortices, but from reducing their magnetic flux and thereby\nreducing the Lorentz force acting on those vortices in the\npresence of a transport current. However, magnetic dots\nabove or below a superconducting film, as in the experimental work referenced above [7, 8, 9, 10], do not achieve\nthis Lorentz force reduction; within the superconductor\nthe vortices retain their full flux. Instead, the magnetic\nmaterial must be embedded in the film, ideally passing\nall the way through it with vortices lying entirely along\nthe inclusions. Furthermore, the inclusions must have\nsufficient magnetisation to divert a significant portion of\na flux quantum, which was not the case for several experiments with small (\u223c 5 nm) inclusions [12, 13, 14].\nRef. [13], in particular, shows that magnetic inclusions\nremain effective at smaller sizes than non-magnetic inclusions, but because the mechanism is still core pinning\nrather than flux reduction, the maximum pinning force\ndoes not improve. In this work, we instead seek to optimise flux diversion by creating larger, strongly magnetic\npinning centres within a niobium film.\nWe take a simple approach to creating a superconductor with embedded magnetic material: we co-deposit\nits constituent elements. For most choices of materials,\nhowever, this would lead to atomic-scale mixing (alloying), which would degrade both the superconductivity\nand the magnetism. In particular, s-wave Cooper pairs\nare highly sensitive to magnetic scattering, requiring regions of magnet-free superconductor larger than the su-\n\n\f2\nperconducting coherence length [15]. So we have chosen\nthe superconductor niobium (Nb) and the rare earth lowtemperature ferromagnet dysprosium (Dy) in the hope\nthat they do not alloy. Although, to our knowledge, this\nsystem has not been investigated previously, a chemically\nsimilar system of tantalum (Ta) and Dy was found to be\nimmiscible [16]. During growth, if the atoms have sufficient mobility, the film should phase-separate into the\ndesired regions of pure superconductor and pure ferromagnet. Dy exhibits a very high saturation magnetisation of 3.7 T below its Curie temperature of 88 K, thus a\n30 nm diameter inclusion could carry an entire flux quantum, 2\u00d710\u221215 Wb. By growing such inclusions, ideally in\na columnar structure, we aim to strongly divert magnetic\nflux from vortices.\nIn the following sections, we show that niobium and\ndysprosium do phase-separate, exhibiting a variety of microstructures as a function of the film composition and\ngrowth temperature. We characterise the microstructures with X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy\n(AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)\ncoupled with element-sensitive detection techniques. We\nthen examine the superconducting properties with both\nmagnetisation and transport measurements. We find coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism over most\nof the growth parameter space, and enhanced critical current in magnetic fields up to the saturation field of the\ndysprosium.\n\nII.\n\nFILM GROWTH\n\nThe films are approximately 200 nm thick, grown by\ndc magnetron sputtering. Niobium and dysprosium targets are co-sputtered to deposit a mixture onto heated\nR-plane [11\u030402] sapphire (Al2 O3 ) substrates. The composition is controlled via the relative magnetron powers to\nhave atomic ratios of Nb:Dy 1:1, 2:1, and 4:1, with a total\ndeposition rate of approximately 5 nm/min. At a fixed\nfilm composition, films with a range of substrate temperatures are grown in each sputtering run. The temperatures reported are those of the heater segment directly\nunder each substrate; the samples are \u223c 150 K cooler,\nbased on a prior calibration. Liquid nitrogen is applied\nto the walls of the deposition chamber to achieve a base\npressure of 4 \u00d7 10\u22128 Pa. The substrate heater raises this\npressure, but baking out the heater keeps the deposition\nbackground below 1\u00d710\u22127 Pa. For sputtering, the chamber is then filled to 0.9 Pa with high-purity argon.\nBefore depositing the Nb:Dy mixture, a third magnetron is used to deposit a 50 nm thick buffer layer of\nTa in order to preclude any possibility of a reaction between the film and the substrate. In particular, a rare\nearth such as Dy may react with the oxygen in Al2 O3 ,\nfreeing Al to combine with Nb [17]. Nb3 Al is a superconductor with a large upper critical field (Hc2 ) that could\ncontribute to the transport properties of the film and distract from our analysis of the composite. The Ta buffer\n\nFIG. 1: Cross sectional TEM image of a Nb:Dy 2:1 film grown\nat 760\u25e6 C shows some nearly vertical grain boundaries, but a\npredominance of disordered growth.\n\nlayer does not significantly affect the transport or magnetic behaviour at the measurement temperature of 4 K,\nas confirmed by a control sample consisting of the tantalum layer only. A set of Nb:Dy films with a 100 nm\nTa layer was also grown to check that the behaviour was\nunchanged from those with a 50 nm Ta layer, indicating that there is no reaction between the film and the\nsubstrate mediated by the buffer thickness.\n\nIII. MICROSTRUCTURAL\nCHARACTERISATION\n\nX-ray diffraction reveals that both niobium and dysprosium exhibit crystalline phases within the composite,\nand some degree of orientation. The width of the peaks,\nhowever, indicates that the grains are smaller than the\n200 nm thickness of the film. The cubic niobium grows\n[001] oriented; the rocking curve of the [002] peak has a\nfull width half maximum (FWHM) of 1.0 to 1.3\u25e6 , while\nthe hexagonal dysprosium shows a [101] peak with a rocking curve FWHM of 3\u25e6 .\nCross-sectional TEM indicates some areas of columnar\ngrowth, in the form of tilted grain boundaries, seen in the\nbright-field image, Fig. 1. Overall, however, the growth\nis not highly ordered, with the TEM confirming the xray result that the grain size is much smaller than the\n200 nm thickness of the film in many places. Energy\nfiltering did not yield sharp contrast between regions of\nNb and Dy, suggesting that the two overlap at a length\nscale below the \u223c 50 nm thickness of the cross-sectional\nspecimen. Thus we expect a vortex in the material to\npass through regions of Dy and Nb, rather than being\noptimally pinned by a through-thickness column of Dy.\nThe thickness variation seen in the cross-sectional\nTEM is not an artefact; the AFM images in Fig. 2 show\nthat some films have thickness corrugations of more than\n100 nm. This corrugation is due to phase separation,\nas explained below, and we expect higher growth temperatures, corresponding to higher mobility for atoms on\nthe deposition surface, to yield a larger length scale for\nthis separation. This holds true for the samples with\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 2: Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of composite films, illustrating the variety of microstructures accessible via\nvarious growth conditions. All images are on the same height and length scales.\n\nthe highest concentration of Dy, Fig. 2(g)\u2013(i), where the\nlength scale of the corrugation increases with increasing growth temperature. By examining these three samples in a scanning electron microscope (SEM), we find\nthat the topography (from secondary electrons) correlates with composition, measured with energy dispersive\nspectrometry (EDS) maps of Nb and Dy concentration.\nFor the film in Fig. 2(i), EDS indicates that the high\nislands are at least 90 atomic % dysprosium and the surrounding low matrix is at least 90% niobium. The films\nin (h) and (g) show successively less composition contrast, probably because the length scale of separation is\nbecoming smaller than the resolution of the EDS (1 \u03bcm).\nIn the Nb:Dy 4:1 samples, in contrast, the length scale\nof corrugation decreases with increasing growth temperature (Fig. 2(a)\u2013(c)). The trend is borne out by the\nsix samples grown, of which three are shown. So while\nthe growth temperature has different effects for different compositions, it does offer a degree of control over\n\nthe microstructure. In Section V, we show that this in\nturn has a dramatic effect on the superconducting performance, with the high temperature, fine-grained films\nyielding the best in-field Jc .\nAn interesting stripe texture is visible in the topography of two of the films, Fig. 2(e) and (h). The stripes\nalso show composition contrast in SEM EDS maps. They\nare are aligned to the [100] axis of Nb (so within the\n[11\u030402] R-plane of the sapphire, they are 45\u25e6 from the\n[0010] axis), suggesting an easy diffusion direction during growth. This is plausible, since the [001] Nb is known\nto grow \u223c 3\u25e6 misoriented relative to the R-plane, potentially leading to the stepped surface typical of a vicinal\nfilm [18]. A stepped surface can also arise from miscut\nR-plane sapphire [18], though we have not applied the\ntemperatures typically necessary to develop such steps,\nand do not observe them on our substrates. Regardless\nof their origin, we expect the stripes' compositional and\ntopographic variation to produce in-plane anisotropy in\n\n\f4\nthe transport properties of the film, which is indeed observed, as described in Section VI.\nTo examine the phase separation with higher resolution, we turn to TEM, looking in plan-view at this same\nstriped film. The stripes are again visible in a high-angle\nannular dark field (HAADF) image (Fig. 3(a)), where\nthe higher atomic number of Dy causes more scattering,\nappearing bright compared to Nb. High magnification\nTEM reveals that the phase separation has additional\nstructure on a much smaller scale. The energy-filtered\nimage of Dy regions in Fig. 3(b) confirms that the dark\nregions in (a) are pure Nb, while the light stripes are a\nmixture of Nb and Dy. Zooming in further on a light\nstripe in (c) reveals complete phase separation only at a\n5 nm length scale. Here, we use EDS to quantitatively\nmap the concentration of each element, displayed as the\nbrightness of two colours, green for Dy and red for Nb.\nOverlaying the images, we can see red and green regions,\nbut no yellow regions in which both are present, so Nb\nand Dy are fully phase-separated.\n\nIV.\n\nCOEXISTENCE OF MAGNETISM AND\nSUPERCONDUCTIVITY\n\nA typical problem with incorporating magnetic materials into superconductors is poisoning of the superconductivity, manifested by a drop in Tc and leading to\nsuppression of Jc [15]. We do see a suppression of Tc at\nhigh concentrations of Dy and low growth temperatures,\nas seen in Fig. 4, where we plot transition temperatures\nobtained by dc transport measurements, with Tc identified as the point of maximum slope in resistance versus\ntemperature. The small-scale phase separation observed\nin TEM (described above) can explain the reduced Tc .\nWe expect that mixing at a length scale below the 20 nm\ncoherence length of pure Nb would suppress the order\nparameter in the Nb regions due to the proximity effect\n[19]. Fortunately, however, Tc is preserved in our films\nover most of the composition-growth temperature phase\ndiagram, suggesting that the Nb and Dy do fully phaseseparate at larger length scales.\nIt is perhaps not surprising, then, that magnetisation\nmeasurements clearly show the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism, seen in Fig. 5. These measurements were performed with a cryogenic vibrating sample\nmagnetometer (VSM). At 10 K, above Tc , the ferromagnetic hysteresis loop of the Dy is the only response visible.\nBelow Tc at 4 K, superconducting diamagnetism simply\nsuperposes on the ferromagnetism. The film is oriented\napproximately parallel to the field to make its superconducting response, which would otherwise dominate, comparable in magnitude to that of the ferromagnet.\n\nV.\n\nENHANCED CRITICAL CURRENT IN\nFIELD\n\nWe gauge the performance of the composites using\ntransport measurements of Jc . The films are patterned\ninto 50 \u03bcm wide (10 \u03bcm for the stripe sample) by 0.5 mm\nlong bridges with a standard 4-point geometry, using\nphotolithography and argon ion milling. The magnetic\nfield is applied perpendicular to the film surface, and Jc\nis determined with a voltage criterion of 0.1 \u03bcV. For the\ndata shown, the samples are cooled to 4 K by static helium exchange gas. Data was also taken at temperatures\nfrom 3 to 8 K, but yielded similar results. After accounting for the residual field applied by our magnet, Jc does\nnot display an offset or hysteresis in the zero-field peak\ngreater than 10 mT when the field was reversed, as might\nbe expected from reverse domain superconductivity [20],\nso we show only one sign of applied field.\nThe composite films exhibit remarkably high critical\ncurrents at high fields. Fig. 6(a) shows that the pure Nb\ndisplays the highest self-field Jc , but the composites outperform it for fields above 0.2 T. While the self-field Jc\namong the composites does not show a clear trend with\ncomposition, the in-field performance improves dramatically with decreasing Dy content over the composition\nrange that we have explored (Fig. 6(a)). It is notable\nthat the optimum field at which high Jc persists in the\ncomposites is the field at which the magnetisation of dysprosium begins to saturate (see the inset of Fig. 6(a)),\nconsistent with the prediction of Blamire et al [11] that\nabove their saturation field, the inclusions cannot shield\nthe superconductor from flux as effectively.\nThe low-field analysis in Ref. [11] suggests, though,\nthat the greatest Jc improvement should occur at zero\nfield, which is not supported by our data. We can instead\nsuppose that the inclusions, by diverting magnetic flux,\ncause the superconducting matrix to see a decreased field,\nrather than a decreased flux of individual vortices. The\naverage field B\u0304 is then the sum of this decreased field,\nB \u2032 , and the magnetisation of the inclusions, M :\nB\u0304 = B \u2032 + \u03bc0 M (B \u2032 ) * f\n\n(1)\n\nwhere f is the volume fraction of magnetic material; this\nnotation is consistent with Ref. [11]. To compare Jc of\nthe plain Nb and Nb:Dy samples, we use Eq. 1 to scale\nthe field values in the plain Nb data from B \u2032 to B\u0304, having measured the normal state magnetisation response\nM (B \u2032 ) for each composite (seen in the inset of Fig. 6(a))\nand f , the volume fraction of Dy. This shifts Jc values to\nhigher applied fields with the addition of magnetic material, as observed for our composites. Comparing the\nscaled Nb data with the composites' data, we find that\nwhile the scaling can explain the performance of the 2:1\nNb:Dy film, the scaling decreases with decreasing Dy content, and therefore overpredicts the in-field performance\nof the 1:1 composite, and underpredicts the 2\u20133 T field\nat which the 4:1 film maintains a substantial Jc .\n\n\f5\n\nFIG. 3: Plan-view transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the Nb:Dy 2:1 film grown at 760\u25e6 C. (a) High-angle\nannular dark field Z-contrast image. The dark regions are pure Nb and the light regions are a mixture of Nb and Dy. (b)\nEnergy-filtered TEM image in which Dy appears bright. (c) Energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) mapping shows that Nb\nand Dy fully phase-separate, but are interwoven at length scales down to 5 nm.\n\nFIG. 4: The transition temperature of the composite films,\nmeasured by dc transport, does not degrade substantially until we lower the niobium content to 50 atomic percent and\ndecrease the growth temperature to 700\u25e6 C.\n\nWe must therefore conclude that Jc is affected by the\nDy in other ways, not just field screening. For example,\nit is plausible that the addition of Dy also causes microstructural defects that decrease the mean free path,\ndecreasing the coherence length, and increasing the upper critical field Hc2 , thereby allowing Jc to persist up\nto higher fields than in pure Nb [21]. The temperature\ndependence of Jc in the best films (Nb:Dy 4:1) supports\nthe notion that Hc2 limits Jc : The field H(T ) at which Jc\ndrops off can be fit to H(T ) = H(0)(1 \u2212 (T /Tc )2 ) where\nT is the temperature. This is the functional form for the\nphenomenological temperature dependence of Hc2 [22].\nWhile the temperature dependence for a given film follows Hc2 , the differences between the composites cannot\n\nFIG. 5: Coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism\nin the Nb:Dy 2:1 film grown at 760\u25e6 C. In this vibrating sample\nmagnetometer (VSM) measurement, the sample is oriented\nnearly parallel to the field in order to reduce the magnitude\nof the diamagnetic superconducting response to make it comparable to the ferromagnetic response.\n\nbe entirely explained by this parameter. For a system in\nthe dirty limit, Hc2 is roughly inversely proportional to\nthe residual resistivity ratio (RRR), resistivity at room\ntemperature divided by resistivity just above Tc . The\n2:1 and 4:1 composites both have RRRs of 5 compared\nto 14 for the pure Nb sample, thus we expect Hc2 to\nbe higher in these films, though this effect, like the flux\nshielding, underpredicts the performance of the 4:1 film,\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 6: (a) Critical current versus applied magnetic field at 4 K of composite films with compositions as labeled. The optimum\ngrowth temperature is shown at each composition: Nb:Dy 1:1 900\u25e6 C, Nb:Dy 2:1 810\u25e6 C, and Nb:Dy 4:1 925\u25e6 C. A pure Nb film\ngrown at 910\u25e6 C is measured for comparison. The inset shows, in corresponding colors, the magnetisation of the same films\nabove Tc at 10 K, normalised by their saturation magnetisations. (b) The evolution of Jc with growth temperature in Nb:Dy\n4:1 films. The in-field performance improves up to 920\u25e6 C.\n\nand cannot explain why 4:1 is so much better than 2:1.\nHc2 enhancement, then, is likely an important factor for\nthe in-field Jc of the composites, but must be coupled\nwith other pinning enhancements to produce the high Jc\nof the 4:1 material.\nAs further evidence for other factors at work, the optimised Jc exhibits a strong dependence on growth temperature. Results are shown for the best-performing composition of Nb:Dy 4:1 in Fig. 6(b). The trend with growth\ntemperature is clear: as the temperature increases from\n700 to 920\u25e6 C, the critical field increases at the expense\nof a decreasing self-field Jc . Above 920\u25e6 C, Jc drops\nthroughout the field range. At high field, then, there\nis an optimum growth temperature around 920\u25e6 C. The\nRRRs for these films (ranging from 4\u20136) cannot explain\ntheir varying performance, thus it cannot reflect a simple\nHc2 increase. It is instead likely that the smaller grain\nsize of the 4:1 films grown at high temperature (see Section III) is increasing Jc , as has been observed for pure\nNb [23].\n\nVI.\n\nANISOTROPIC TRANSPORT FROM\nSTRIPES\n\nThe film that exhibits the stripes in topography and\ncomposition shown in Fig. 3 (Nb:Dy 2:1 grown at 760\u25e6 )\nalso exhibits in-plane anisotropy in Jc . By patterning\nbridges at a series of in-plane angles (see Fig. 7), we find\nthat Jc is approximately twice as high when the current\nis applied parallel to the stripes as perpendicular, with\nthe intermediate angles following the trend. This can\n\nFIG. 7: Critical current, Jc , versus applied magnetic field\nat 4 K for the Nb:Dy 2:1 film grown at 760\u25e6 C. The colours\nand symbols indicate the in-plane angles of the four bridges\nmeasured, as shown in the inset. Jc is highest parallel to the\nstripes present in the topography and composition of the film\n(see Fig. 3).\n\nbe explained simply by the topographic variation visible\nin Fig. 2(e): current traversing the stripes must cross regions half as thick as the rest of the film, whereas current\nrunning along the stripes can, to a large extent, avoid\nthese regions. Such anisotropic transport structures of\ninterconnected filaments are desirable in superconducting power applications to limit ac losses [24, 25]. Not\n\n\f7\nonly does this structure emerge naturally in our system,\nbut it does so with very small filament pitch (750 nm),\nwhich should yield proportionally smaller ac losses compared to artificially patterned films [25].\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCo-deposition of immiscible metals has proven to\nbe a simple but successful method of producing a\nsuperconductor-ferromagnet nanocomposite that vastly\noutperforms the pure superconducting material. We find\nthat for less than 50% Dy or growth temperatures above\n750\u25e6 C, Tc is not suppressed, and superconductivity coexists with magnetism, indicating full phase separation.\nThe magnetic inclusions lead to enhanced Jc above 0.2 T,\nup to their saturation field of 3 T. This performance is\nsensitive to both composition and growth temperature.\nThe high-field performance of the optimum composite\nmaterial cannot be fully accounted for with calculated\nimprovements due to the magnetism of the Dy and the\nenhanced Hc2 of the material. So it remains likely that\n\n[1] Foltyn S R, Civale L, Macmanus-Driscoll J L, Jia Q X,\nMaiorov B, Wang H and Maley M 2007 Nat.

Because the\nmicrostructure is not well controlled, though, we cannot\nconstruct comparable non-magnetic composites to isolate the contribution of magnetism to Jc . Nonetheless,\nthe coincidence of the saturation field of Dy and the field\nrange of enhanced Jc is evidence for the role of high magnetic susceptibility in the pinning. Better control of the\nnanoscale structure of the pinning centres in future work\nmay reveal the full potential of this magnetic pinning.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Drs Yury Bugoslavsky and Mannan Ali\nfor preliminary magnetometry, and Drs Stuart Wimbush and John Durrell for measurement assistance.
