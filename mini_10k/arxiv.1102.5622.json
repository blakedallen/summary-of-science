Because the BECs in double wells can be regarded as a two-level system, it is also expected either\nto be employed as a possible qubit or to simulate certain\nissues [12] in quantum computation and information. Recently, the effect of decoherence of BECs in double wells\nwas investigated experimentally by means of interference\nbetween BECs [13, 14] and studied theoretically in terms\nof single-particle density matrix [15]. In order to exhibit the phenomena of decoherence, they [13\u201315] need to\nintroduce the condensate-environment coupling because\none-species BEC in double wells were merely considered\nthere. In comparison to one-species BEC system, the\ntwo-species system can exhibit distinct decoherence phenomena due to the existence of the interspecies interaction. For example, the degree of coherence in a twospecies system can evolve with time without the application of condensate-environment coupling, which is useful\nfor one to get a system with desired degree of coherence.\nIt is therefore worthwhile to study the coherence dynamics of two-species BECs in double wells.\nIn this paper, we study the effects of the inter-well\ntunneling strength on the coherence dynamics for a system of two-species BECs in double wells. With the help\nof the reduced single-particle density matrix, we show\nthat such a system can exhibit decoherence phenomena\nwithout condensate-environment coupling. We also propose an experimental strategy to prepare a BEC system\nwith any desired degree of coherence through a timedependent tunneling strength. In the next section, we\nmodel the two-species BEC system and introduce the reduced single-particle density matrix. In Sec. III, we study\n\nthe time evolution of the degree of coherence for a timeindependent inter-well tunneling strength. In Sec. IV, we\ninvestigate the time evolution of the degree of coherence\nfor a Rosen-Zener form of tunneling strength and discuss\nthe possibility of preparing a BEC system with any degree of coherence. Then we briefly give our conclusion in\nSec. V.\nII.\n\nMODEL AND REDUCED DENSITY\nMATRIX\n\nWe consider a two-species Bose-Einstein condensate\nsystem confined in double wells. The Hamiltonian is\ngiven by\nX\n\u0168ab n\u0302ai n\u0302bi\n\u0124 = \u2212Ja (\u00e2\u20201 \u00e22 + H.c.) \u2212 Jb (b\u0302\u20201 b\u03022 + H.c.) +\ni\n\n+\n\nX1\ni\n\n2\n\n\u0168aa n\u0302ai n\u0302ai +\n\nX1\ni\n\n2\n\n\u0168bb n\u0302bi n\u0302bi ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u00e2\u2020i (b\u0302\u2020i ) and \u00e2i (b\u0302i ) creates and annihilates a bosonic\natom of species a (b) in the ith well, respectively; n\u0302ai =\n\u00e2\u2020i \u00e2i (n\u0302bi = b\u0302\u2020i b\u0302i ) denotes the particle number operator\nof species a (b). Here the parameters Ja and Jb denote the tunneling strengths of species a and b between\nthe two wells, \u0168aa and \u0168bb are the intraspecies interaction strengths, and \u0168ab is the interspecies interaction\nstrength. The Hamiltonian (1) can describe a BEC mixture confined in a double well potential consisting of different atoms, or different isotopes, or different hyperfine\nstates of the same kind of atom. The coherence dynamics\nof the above model has not been investigated although its\ndynamical properties, like Josephson oscillation, stability\nand measure synchronization etc., have been studied in\nearlier works [5, 11, 16]. Whereas, we know that the\nrole of coherence of the system is very important since\nthe first obstacle attempted to be avoided is the decoherence when a condensate in double wells is expected to be\nemployed as a qubit. So the coherence dynamics of the\nmodel (1) is worthy of study.\n\n\f2\nAs we know, under the semiclassical limit [2, 6, 9, 17],\nthe dynamics of this system is conventionally studied in\nmean-field approach by replacing the expectation values\nof annihilators with complex numbers, i.e., h \u00e2i i = \u00e3i\nand h b\u0302i i = b\u0303i . With the help of Heisenberg equation of\nmotion for operators, one can easily get the dynamical\nequations for \u00e3i and b\u0303i . These equations guarantee the\nconservation law |\u00e31 |2 + |\u00e32 |2 = N/2 and |b\u03031 |2 + |b\u03032 |2 =\nN/2 with N being the total particle number of species a\n\nHeff\n\ni\n\nd\n| \u03c8i = Heff | \u03c8i\ndt\n\n\uf8f6\nUa |a1 |2 + Uab |b1 |2\n\u2212Ja\n0\n0\n2\n2\n\u2212Ja\nUa |a2 | + Uab |b2 |\n0\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n=\uf8ed\n\uf8f8,\n0\n0\nUb |b1 |2 + Uab |a1 |2\n\u2212Jb\n2\n2\n0\n0\n\u2212Jb\nUb |b2 | + Uab |a2 |\n\na1 , a2 , b 1 , b 2\n\n\u0001T\n\n=\n\nX\n\u03c3,i\n\n| \u03c3i\u2297 | ii,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the state | \u03c3i =| ai or | bi specifies the two different\nspecies while | ii =| 1i or | 2i specifies the two wells.\nNote that the dynamical properties of the system can\nbe determined by Eq. (2) if the system is in a completely\ncoherent state (i.e., a pure state). Whereas, if the system\nis in a mixed state, the equation (2) becomes insufficient.\nIn order to study the coherence dynamics of the system, we introduce the single-particle density matrix \u03c1\u0302 =|\n\u03c8ih\u03c8 | whose elements are \u03c1\u03bc\u03bd (\u03bc, \u03bd = 1, 2, 3, 4). From\nthis definition, we can see that, as a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix, \u03c1\u0302 describes a pure state. Their diagonal elements \u03c111 (\u03c122 )\nand \u03c133 (\u03c144 ) represent the population of species a (b)\nin the first and second well, respectively. In this paper,\nwe only focus on the distribution of the total particle\nnumbers in the two wells but not distinguish the particle\nspecies, so the system can be described by the reduced\ndensity matrix\nX\n\u03c1\u0302r =\nh\u03c3 | \u03c1\u0302 | \u03c3i,\n(5)\n\u03c3\n\nwhose elements are \u03c1r11 = \u03c111 + \u03c133 , \u03c1r12 = \u03c112 + \u03c134 ,\n\u03c1r21 = \u03c121 + \u03c143 , and \u03c1r22 = \u03c122 + \u03c144 . Clearly, the matrix\n\u03c1\u0302r can describe a mixed state. Its diagonal elements \u03c1r11\nand \u03c1r22 represent the total population probability in the\nfirst and second well, respectively. To investigate the\ncoherence dynamics of the system, we can introduce the\ndefinition of degree of coherence according to Ref. [4, 17],\n\u03b7 = Tr(\u03c1\u0302r )2 \u2212 1.\n\n(6)\n\nFrom Eq. (5) and Eq. (6), we can see that the time evolution of the degree of coherence depends on that of the\n\n(2)\n\nwith\n\n\uf8eb\n\nwhere Ua = \u0168aa N , Ub = \u0168bb N , and Uab = \u0168ab N . Here\nthe wave function | \u03c8i refers to\n| \u03c8i =\n\nand b. To\none usually assumes\n\u221a simplify the calculation,\n\u221a\nai = \u00e3i / N and bi = b\u0303i / N . Then the aforementioned\ndynamical equations for \u00e3i and b\u0303i can be rewritten as,\n\n(3)\n\nelements \u03c1\u03bc\u03bd of the single-particle density matrix \u03c1\u0302. Since\n\u03c1\u0302 describes a pure state, the time evolution of \u03c1\u03bc\u03bd can\nbe determined by Eq. (2). Thus one can solve Eq. (2)\nto get the evolution of ai and bi firstly, and then gives\nthe time evolution of \u03c1\u03bc\u03bd according to the definition of\n\u03c1\u0302 =| \u03c8ih\u03c8 |. Then in the following sections, we will study\nthe coherence dynamics of the system with the help of\nEq. (2). Note that in the following calculations, we take\nJa = Jb = J for simplicity without losing the generality.\nIII.\n\nEVOLUTION OF DEGREE OF\nCOHERENCE\n\nWe know that the degree of coherence does not change\nfor an isolated BEC system [4]. To study the effect of\ndecoherence of BEC system, several authors considered\nthe condensate-environment coupling [15, 18]. Whereas,\nwe will show that the degree of coherence of the twospecies BEC system in double wells can still change with\ntime even without the condensate-environment coupling.\nHere we consider the case of time-independent inter-well\ntunneling strength, i.e., J is a constant in the calculation. Due to the fact that Eq. (2) can not be analytically\nsolved, we solve Eq. (2) numerically to get the time evolution of ai and bi . Then we give the time evolution of\nthe degree of coherence with the help of the definition\nof \u03c1\u0302 and \u03c1\u0302r and Eq. (6). The corresponding results are\nsummarized in Fig. 1.\nIn Fig. 1, we plot the time evolution of the degree\nof coherence for different initial\np states and parameters.\np\nThe initial states are a1 = 1/2, a2 = 0, p\nb1 =\n1/2\n2/5, a2 =\nand\nfor the blue (top) line, a1 =\np b2 = 0 p\n1/10, b1 p\n= 1/2 and b2 = 0 for the red (middle)\nline,\np\nand a1 = 1/2, a2 = 0, b1 = 0 and b2 = 1/2 for the\nblack (bottom) line. From the Fig. 1 (a), we can find that\nthe degree of coherence of the two-species BEC system in\ndouble wells does not change for any initial states when\n\n\f3\nand the parameters of the system, so one can change it\nby varying either the initial states or the parameters of\nthe system. In the following, we will show how to control\nthe degree of coherence through a Rosen-Zener form of\nJ,\n\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n0.4\n\nJ = J0 sin2 \u03c9t\n\n0.2\n0.0\n\n(0 \u2264 t \u2264 \u03c0/\u03c9),\n\n(7)\n\ni.e., J increases from zero to its maximum value J0 and\nthen decreases to zero again in the end of the calculation.\nIn the numerical \u221a\ncalculation\u221ain this section,\nwe take the\n\u221a\ninitial state a1 = 0.4, a2 = 0.1, b1 = 0.5, and b2 = 0.\n\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n\n(c)\n\n0.4\n\n(d)\n\n0.2\n\n1.0\n\n0.0\n0\n\n5\n\nt(1/J)\n\n10\n\n0\n\n5\n\n(tmax,\n\n10\n\nt(1/J)\n\nmax\n\n)\n\n0.8\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Time evolution of the degree of coherence for different initial states.

That can be easily understood because\nthis two-species system is equivalent to the one-species\nsystem once Ua = Ub = Uab . And according to Ref. ([4]),\nthe degree of coherence of the one-species BEC system\nin double wells does not change without the condensateenvironment coupling. So the result shown in Fig. 1 (a)\nis reasonable. The figure 1 (b) shows that when Ua =\nUb 6= Uab , the degree of coherence does not change for\nthe case of ai = bi at the initial time, i.e., the initial\npopulation distributions of species a and b are the same,\nbut that changes for the other initial states. Note that\nfor the case of Ua = Ub 6= Uab , the time evolutions of\nspecies a and b are the same if ai = bi at the initial\ntime. So the degree of coherence does not change due to\nthe two species having the same symmetry. Additionally,\nfrom the Fig. 1 (c) and (d), we can find that the degree\nof coherence changes for any initial states for the case of\nUa 6= Ub 6= Uab . Comparing Fig. 1 (c) and (d), we can see\nthat for the same initial state, the variation tendency of\nthe degree of coherence depends on the parameters of the\nsystem. In summary, whether the degree of coherence\ncan change with time depends on both the parameters\nand the initial states. So does the variation tendency of\nthe degree of coherence. This fact indicates that one can\ncontrol the degree of coherence without introducing the\neffect of environment, which will be discussed in the next\nsection.\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n600\n\n0\n0.004\n\n0.008\n\nUa\n\n0.012\n\n0.016\n\n0.004\n\n0.008\n\n0.012\n\n0.016\n\nUa\n\nFIG. 3: The dependence of the maximum value of the degree\nof coherence (left panel) and the corresponding time (right\npanel) on the period of the inter-well tunneling strength.

We can see that the degree of coherence\nchanges with time and can reach the maximum value\n\u03b7max at time t = tmax . Note that the values of \u03b7max and\nt = tmax depend on both the period \u03c9 and the maximum\nvalue J0 of the inter-well tunneling strength.

The parameters are Ub = Ua , Uab = Ua , J0 =\n3\n3\n1\nUa .\n3\n\nJ0 in the left and right panel, respectively. Meanwhile,\nwe plot the dependence of \u03b7max and tmax on J0 for a fixed\n\u03c9 in Fig. 4.\nFrom Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, we can see that the values\nof \u03c9 and J0 affect the maximum value of the degree of\ncoherence sensitively. In order to get a system with large\nvalue of degree of coherence, one must choose the form of\nJ with suitable period \u03c9 and maximum value J0 . Note\nthat although one can get a system with large value of\ndegree of coherence through tuning the value of \u03c9 and J0 ,\nit is difficult to control the time evolution of the degree\nof coherence due to the fact that the degree of coherence\ndoes not evolve periodically, which can be confirmed by\nFig. 2. In order to overcome the aforementioned problem,\nwe consider the following form of J\n(\nJ0 sin2 \u03c9t\n(0 \u2264 t \u2264 tmax )\nJ=\n(8)\n0\n(t > tmax ),\nwhere tmax can be obtained from Fig. 3 and Fig. 4.\nFor the form of J given in Eq. (8), the time evolution of the degree of coherence is plotted in Fig. 5.\nFrom this figure, we can find that the degree of coherence reaches its maximum value which is determined\nby the values of \u03c9 and J0 , and then oscillates periodically at the following time. Since Eq. (2) can be analytically solved for the case of J = 0, we can give\nthe oscillation period in analytical method. Solving\nEq. (2), we obtain ai (t) = ai (tmax ) exp (\u2212iAi t), and\nbi (t) = bi (tmax ) exp (\u2212iBi t) where Ai = Ua |ai (tmax )|2 +\nUab |bi (tmax )|2 , and Bi = Ub |bi (tmax )|2 + Uab |ai (tmax )|2 .\nSubstituting the expressions of ai and bi into the Eq. (6),\nwe can get the oscillation period of the degree of coherence T = 2\u03c0/|A2 \u2212 A1 + B1 \u2212 B2 |. For the parameters\ntaken in Fig. 5, we find T Ua = 56.5 which is consistent\nwith the numerical result. From the above discussion,\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Time evolution of the degree of coherence for the inter-well tunneling strength given in Eq. (8).\n2\n1\n1\nThe parameters are Ub = Ua , Uab = Ua , J0 = Ua , \u03c9 =\n3\n3\n3\n0.005Ua .\n\nwe know that the degree of coherence oscillates periodically after time tmax , and both the maximum value of\nthe degree of coherence and the oscillation period can\nbe changed by tuning the values of \u03c9 and J0 . Once the\nvalues of \u03c9 and J0 are fixed, the time evolution of the\ndegree of coherence is well defined, so that we can know\nthe degree of coherence of the system at any time. Then\none can easily get a system with any desired degree of\ncoherence through controlling the evolution time.\n\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn the above, we investigated the coherence dynamics for a system of two-species Bose-Einstein condensate in double wells. In mean field approximation, we\nstudied the influence of the inter-well tunneling strength\non the coherence features with the help of the reduced\nsingle-particle density matrix. Since we need not distinguish particle species in the system, we only focused\non the distribution of the total particle numbers in the\ntwo wells, which can be described by a 2\u00d72 reduced density matrix. After studying the time evolution of the degree of coherence for a time-independent inter-well tunneling strength, we found that the degree of coherence\nof the two-species BEC system changes for some parameters and initial states even without the condensateenvironment coupling, which differs from the case of\nRefs. [15, 18]. Motivated by the fact that the variation\ntendency of the degree of coherence depends on both the\nparameters and the initial states of the system, we considered a system with a Rosen-Zener form of inter-well\ntunneling strength to control the degree of coherence. Although its tendency is not periodical, the degree of coherence can reach a maximum value \u03b7max at time tmax which\nare dependent of the period \u03c9 and the maximum value\nJ0 of the inter-well tunneling strength. The dependence\nof \u03b7max and tmax on \u03c9 and J0 we obtained is helpful for\none to get a system with large value of degree of coherence utilizing a Rosen-Zener form of inter-well tunneling\nstrength. We also gave a useful form of the inter-well tunneling strength for one to easily get a system with any\n\n\f5\ndegree of coherence by controlling the evolution time.\nThe work is supported by NSFC under Grant No.\n\n[1] Y.
