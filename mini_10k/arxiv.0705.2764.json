This brings us close to the argumentation\nof the later EPR thought experiment.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe 1930 Solvay conference was the scene of the famous weighing-of-energy\ndebate between Einstein and Bohr. According to Bohr's report [1], the debate\nrevolved around the validity of the time-energy uncertainty relation. As Bohr\ntells us, Einstein had devised an ingenious thought experiment (involving a\n\"photon box\") with which he wanted to demonstrate that an individual photon\ncan have both a sharply defined energy and a precisely predictable time of arrival\nat a detector. If successful, this would mean the demise of the time-uncertainty\nrelation. Einstein himself later maintained that Bohr had misunderstood his\n1\n\n\fintentions: that it was not the validity of the uncertainty relation, but rather\nthe unpalatable implications of complementarity in the case of correlated distant\nsystems that he was targeting. Considered either way, the thought experiment\nfurnishes a remarkable illustration of quantum mechanical complementarity.\nThe idea of the experiment is to start with a box, filled with radiation,\nhanging stationary in the gravitational field (after a preliminary balancing procedure). In this situation the total energy of the box and its contents has a\nwell-defined value1 . Inside of the box there is a clock that opens a small shutter\nwhen its hands reach a fixed position. This shutter remains open for a very\nbrief time interval, during which one photon escapes. After the photon's escape\n(possibly at a much later time), the box is weighed, so that its mass-and therefore its energy-can be determined. Comparison with the initial situation gives\nus the energy of the escaped photon. In addition we can read off the internal\nclock, and this will tell us how much time has elapsed since the opening of the\nshutter.\nThe weighing is performed by looking at how the center of mass of the box\nhas moved under the influence of gravity since the photon's escape2 . Since\nthe dynamical quantities of the center of mass commute with the variables of\nthe internal clock, it is possible to perform a measurement in which both the\nposition of the hands of the clock and the position (or momentum) of the center\nof mass of the box are sharply determined. It therefore appears clear that\nboth the energy and the time of escape of the photon can be determined with\narbitrary precision. That, however, would imply a violation of the time-energy\nuncertainty principle applied to the photon-quantum mechanics must in some\nway forbid this joint precise determination. Consistency requires that the mass\nof the box and the opening time of the shutter, as determined from the weighingplus-reading-off-the-clock measurement, be complementary quantities. To show\nexactly how quantum mechanics makes this happen is the main purpose of this\nnote.\nBohr writes that some time after the original debate\n\"[Ehrenfest] told me that Einstein was far from satisfied and with\nhis usual acuteness had discerned new aspects of the situation which\nstrengthened his critical attitude. In fact, by further examining the\npossibilities for the application of a balance arrangement, Einstein\nhad perceived alternative procedures which, even if they did not\nallow the use he originally intended, might seem to enhance the\nparadoxes beyond the possibilities of logical solution. Thus, Einstein\nhad pointed out that, after a preliminary weighing of the box with\n1 Since the box system has a very large mass, the spread in energy can be vanishingly small\neven though the spreads in position and momentum of its center of mass do not vanish.\n2 In fact, Bohr suggests to bring the box back to its zero position by attaching suitable\nloads. This is just another way of studying the center of mass quantities. Therefore, although\nour calculations are based on a slightly different weighing procedure, the underlying principle\napplies equally to the procedure that was analysed by Bohr.\n\n2\n\n\fthe clock and the subsequent escape of the photon, one was still\nleft with the choice of either repeating the weighing or opening the\nbox and comparing the reading of the clock with the standard time\nscale. Consequently, we are at this stage still free to choose whether\nwe want to draw conclusions either about the energy of the photon\nor about the moment when it left the box.\" ([1], pp. 228-229).\nThus, according to this account Einstein later shifted towards EPR-like considerations: apparently having been convinced at the Solvay conference by\nBohr's arguments, Einstein now started pointing out that even if the photon\nis already far away, we can still decide to perform one or the other of a pair of\ncomplementary measurements and thus \"prepare\" the photon in either a state\nwith a well-defined energy or in a state peaked in time. This is highly remarkable, since we would expect the distant photon to be a system on its own, with\nproperties that cannot depend on what happens outside of its lightcone. As already mentioned, it may be that Bohr misinterpreted the logic of the sequence\nof events here: perhaps Einstein already accepted the validity of the uncertainty\nrelations in 1930 and meant his photon box experiment from the start as a kind\nof delayed choice experiment. This is in fact what is suggested by looking at the\nprecise text of Ehrenfest's message to Bohr. Ehrenfest visited Einstein in 1931\nand found him to be very outspoken about the purpose of the photon box. In\nhis letter to Bohr of 9 July 1931, Ehrenfest reported: \"He said to me that, for\na long time already, he absolutely no longer doubted the uncertainty relations,\nand that he thus, e.g., had BY NO MEANS invented the 'weighable light-flash\nbox' 'contra uncertainty relation', but for a totally different purpose\" [5].\nRegardless of whether Bohr's or Einstein's account is closer to the truth, it\nis an important point that the box-plus-photon system furnishes an example\nof simultaneously existing strict correlations between complementary quantities. Einstein's thought experiment can be considered a forerunner of the EPRexperiment. These general features of the experiment we shall address first (see\nalso [3] for references to earlier discussions of the photon box).\n\n2\n\nGlobal Analysis of the Experiment\n\nAn essential element of the photon-box experiment is the correlation that exists\nbetween box and photon quantities after the photon has escaped. The relevant\nphoton quantities are its energy Eph and its time of arrival at a given detector,\nTarr . These are correlated with the box energy E and the position of the hands\nof the clock in the box, qcl , respectively. The two energies are correlated as a\nconsequence of total energy conservation; and since the clock allowed the photon\nto escape when its hands were at a fixed predetermined position, qcl = 0, say,\nafter which the photon travelled with the fixed speed c, qcl and Tarr are also\ncorrelated.\n\n3\n\n\fThe two photon quantities, energy and time of arrival, are complementary\naccording to quantum mechanics. Indeed, an energy eigenstate is a plane wave,\nwhich obviously does not have a well-defined time of arrival at a given point;\nconversely a very narrow wave packet contains very many different frequencies, and therefore is a superposition of different energy states. Paradoxically,\nit nevertheless seems that these two photon quantities can simultaneously be\ndetermined, with arbitrary precision, via judicious measurements on the box.\nBut if quantum mechanics is consistent, any uncertainty relation valid for the\nphoton quantities must obviously have its counterpart in an uncertainty relation\nfor the correlated box quantities-it should be impossible to beat the uncertainty\nrelation for photon quantities by measuring correlated box quantities. We should\ntherefore expect that the box cannot possess both a definite value of its energy\nand a definite time at which the shutter opened. In view of the correlations\nbetween the box and the photon, the total state of these two systems has to\nbe entangled, such that neither the energies nor the relevant time quantities of\nboth box and photon are sharply defined, whereas their correlation is a sharply\ndefined quantity of the total system 3 .\nAccording to relativity, all energy possesses mass and is acted upon by gravity. The experiment starts with the box in a stationary position after a preliminary weighing, but after the escape of the photon the box experiences a net\nforce, which depends on the mass of the escaped photon, m. As a consequence,\nthe box starts moving and both the position q and the momentum p of its center of mass get correlated to m. A measurement of either p or q will therefore\nprovide information about m. On the other hand, reading off the time indicated\nby the clock, qcl , will yield information about how much time has passed since\nthe shutter was opened. Both qcl and either p or q can be measured and can\njointly have sharp values, since these quantities pertain to different systems-the\ninternal clock and the center of mass of the box, respectively-and commute.\nWe have already argued that the escape time calculated from qcl , and on the\nother hand the box energy as computed from a measurement of either p or q,\nmust be complementary quantities. This should be reflected by a non-vanishing\nvalue of the commutator of the operators representing these quantities. That\nthis is indeed so, and that this leads to exactly the right uncertainty relations,\nis what we shall show now.\n3 This in turn means that the box and the photon will not have their own pure states:\nboth must be described by mixed states. These mixed states can be written as mixtures of\nwell-defined mass states, or alternatively as mixtures of states peaked in time. As long as we\ndiscuss the two systems separately, we may think of these mixtures as classical \"ignorance\nmixtures\" without getting into contradictions.\n\n4\n\n\f3\n\nComplementarity of Mass and Escape Time\n\nWe start our considerations with the joint measurement of either p or q of the\ncenter of mass of the box, together with the clock variable qcl . This measurement takes place when the photon is already well on its way. The chosen center\nof mass quantity and the clock variable may both be measured with arbitrary\nprecision: the corresponding operators commute. However, in order to be able\nto say something about the photon, we have to calculate back to values of the\nrelevant quantities at the time the shutter opened and the photon escaped. To\nmake this stand out in the calculations below, we choose the origin of time,\nt = 0, at the moment of the final measurement and choose the positive time\ndirection backwards, i.e. going into the direction of the earlier photon emission\nevent. We shall show that the state of the box corresponding to the measurement result (this state can be thought of as resulting from application of the\nprojection postulate, or \"collapse of the wavefunction\" to the pre-measurement\nbox state), when followed back in time to the instant of the photon emission,\nexhibits quantum spreads that exactly lead to the expected-and required-\nuncertainties in Eph and Tarr .\nTaking into account that during the motion of the box the clock finds itself\nat different heights in the gravitational field, depending on the position of the\ncenter of mass, q, we have the following expression for the clock variable at time\nt before the final measurement (t = 0 corresponds to the final measurement and\nt is counted backwards):\nqcl (t) =\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nd\u03c4 (1 \u2212\n\n0\n\ngq(\u03c4 )\n).\nc2\n\n(1)\n\nBohr took recourse to general relativity to justify the use of this formula, but\nsince then it has be shown [7] that Eq. (1) follows from just the assumption that\nenergy has mass and can be weighed (which is exactly what Einstein needed to\nposit in order to make the thought experiment work in the first place). This is\nan important point that makes the analysis of the experiment self-contained: it\nwould not be satisfactory if only by invoking general relativity the consistency\nof quantum mechanics could be demonstrated.\nFrom (1) we see that\ng\n(2)\nq\u0307cl (t) = 1 \u2212 2 q(t).\nc\nFor the Heisenberg equations of motion of the vertical position and momentum of the box we have, with the same convention about t:\nq\u0307(t) = p/M\n\n,\n\n\u1e57(t) = \u2212mg \u2212 V \u2032 (q),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere V (q) is the potential in which the box finds itself (in Bohr's description of\nthe experiment the box is suspended from a spring, which would correspond to\n\n5\n\n\fV (q) = 1/2kq 2, with k the spring constant); the prime indicates differentiation\nwith respect to vertical position.\nThe commutators [p, qcl ] and [q, qcl ] both vanish at t = 0; this means that\nin the measurement sharp values can be assigned to both qcl and either p or\nq. But in the Heisenberg picture the commutators change in time and do not\nremain null. For the change of the commutator of p and qcl we can write down\nthe following differential equation:\nd\ng\n[p, qcl ] = [\u1e57, qcl ] + [p, q\u0307cl ] = 2 ih\u0304 \u2212 [V \u2032 (q), qcl ],\ndt\nc\n\n(4)\n\nwhere (2) and (3) have been used. Similarly, we find for the commutator between\nq and qcl :\nd\n1\n[q, qcl ] = [q\u0307, qcl ] + [q, q\u0307cl ] = [q\u0307, qcl ] =\n[p, qcl ].\ndt\nM\n\n(5)\n\nIt follows that in the simplest situation, in which V \u2032 vanishes and the box\nonly experiences the force of gravity, we have\n[p, qcl ] =\n\ng\nih\u0304t\nc2\n\n(6)\n\nand\n\ng\nih\u0304t2 .\n(7)\n2M c2\nSo the center of mass coordinates develop (recall: backwards in time!) nonvanishing commutators with the clock variable qcl . Therefore qcl cannot possess\na sharp value together with either p or q at the time of the photon emission!\nAs a consequence of Eq. (6) we have the following uncertainty relation4\nbetween p and qcl at time t\n[q, qcl ] =\n\n\u2206p.\u2206qcl \u2265\n\ntg\nh\u0304.\n2c2\n\n(8)\n\nSince in this case, with V \u2032 = 0, it follows from (3) that p(t) = p(0) \u2212 mgt, we\nhave the following relation between the uncertainties in p and m:\n\u2206p = gt\u2206m.\n\n(9)\n\nThis uncertainty in m must be understood in the following way. As we\nhave just shown, the final measurement result, which may be completely sharp,\ntranslates back to a state with width \u2206p at the time of the photon emission.\nThis introduces an uncertainty in the determination of m: different values of m\ncould have led to the same final measurement result because the value of p(t),\n4 Analogously to the standard uncertainty relation \u2206p.\u2206q \u2265\ncanonical commutation relation [p, q] = \u2212ih\u0304.\n\n6\n\n1\nh\u0304\n2\n\nthat follows from the\n\n\fas ascertained from the final measurement is uncertain. The value \u2206m just\ncalculated is the range of m-values that is compatible with the width \u2206p(t) and\nthe measurement result. This \u2206m equals the uncertainty with which we can\nmake a prediction about the mass of the photon, on the basis of the measured\nvalue p(0). 5\nEquation (8), together with the fact that the uncertainty in qcl at t equals\nthe uncertainty \u2206T in the instant of the opening of the shutter and together\nwith \u2206E = c2 \u2206m, leads to\n1\n\u2206E.\u2206T \u2265 h\u0304.\n(10)\n2\nAlternatively, we may focus on q instead of p in order to determine m. This\nwould be in line with Bohr's account in which the center of mass of the box is\nrigidly connected to a pointer that moves along a scale. In this case we find\ngt2\n\u2206m, which together with (7) leads to\nfrom (3): \u2206q = 2M\n\u2206E.\u2206T = c2 \u2206m.\u2206qcl =\n\n2c2 M\n1\n.\u2206q.\u2206qcl \u2265 h\u0304.\ngt2\n2\n\n(11)\n\nSo regardless of whether we measure p or q, we shall not be able to predict\nthe energy and arrival time of the photon with a smaller latitude than allowed\nby the time-energy uncertainty relation.\nIf V \u2032 depends on q, the calculations become more complicated. Let us have\na look at the case suggested in Bohr's account, in which the box is suspended\nfrom a spring. We can model this situation by assuming a harmonic force \u2212kq,\nwith k a positive constant. This leads to the following Heisenberg equations of\nmotion:\nq\u0307(t) = p/M , \u1e57(t) = \u2212mg \u2212 kq,\n(12)\nand therefore\n\nm\nk\ng\u2212\nq.\nM\nM\nThe solutions of these equations are given by:\nq\u0308(t) = \u2212\n\nq(t) =\nand\np(t) = \u2212\n\np(0)\nmg\n(cos \u03c9t \u2212 1) + q(0) cos \u03c9t +\nsin \u03c9t,\nk\nM\u03c9\nM m\u03c9g\n(sin \u03c9t) \u2212 M \u03c9q(0) sin \u03c9t + p(0) cos \u03c9t,\nk\n\n(13)\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\nin which \u03c9 2 = k/M .\n5 Since the state of the box is a mixture of components with different m-values, we may\nargue about the situation in a classical way: different possible values of m lead to uncertainty\nin the evolution and consequently to an uncertainty in p.\n\n7\n\n\fFor the uncertainties in m connected with \u2206q and \u2206p, respectively, we thus\nfind (for \u03c9t << M/m):\n\u2206mq (t) =\n\nk\n\u2206q(t),\ng(1 \u2212 cos \u03c9t)\n\n(16)\n\n\u2206mp (t) =\n\nk\n\u2206p(t).\nM \u03c9g sin \u03c9t\n\n(17)\n\nand\n\nThe commutators [p, qcl ] and [q, qcl ] in this case, with V (q) = 21 kq 2 , satisfy\nthe equations\ng\nd\n[p, qcl ] = 2 ih\u0304 \u2212 k[q, qcl ],\ndt\nc\n\n(18)\n\n1\nd\n[q, qcl ] =\n[p, qcl ],\ndt\nM\n\n(19)\n\nd2\nk\n[p, qcl ] = \u2212 [p, qcl ].\n2\ndt\nM\n\n(20)\n\nso that\n\nIt follows that\n\ng sin \u03c9t\nih\u0304,\nc2 \u03c9\ng 1 \u2212 cos \u03c9t\nih\u0304.\n[q, qcl ] = 2\nc\nM \u03c92\nThis yields the uncertainty relations\n[p, qcl ] =\n\ng sin \u03c9t\nh\u0304,\n2\u03c9c2\n\n\u2206p.\u2206qcl \u2265\n\n(21)\n(22)\n\n(23)\n\ng(1 \u2212 cos \u03c9t)\nh\u0304.\n(24)\n2M \u03c9 2 c2\nTogether with equations (16) and (17) this leads to the expected uncertainty\nrelations for E and T .\nSo regardless of whether the box is moving freely or executes a harmonic\nmotion, and regardless of whether we base our predictions on a determination\nof q or on a determination of p, we always find \u2206E.\u2206T \u2265 12 h\u0304. The uncertainties\nin q and p on the one hand, and in qcl on the other, guarantee that no conflict\nwith the time-energy uncertainty relation for the photon can arise. The essential\npoint is that the box quantities qcl and m (as calculated from either p or q) form\na complementary pair.\n\u2206q.\u2206qcl \u2265\n\n8\n\n\f4\n\nEpilogue\n\nOne might still wonder about the completely general case, with arbitrary V (q).\nThe result of any specific calculation is known beforehand, however: Any spread\nin the energy (or equivalently mass) of the box, regardless of whether introduced\nby an uncertainty \u2206q or an uncertainty \u2206p, will result in an uncertainty in the\nevolution of qcl by virtue of the general time-energy relation [6, 2, 4]\n\u2206H.\n\n\u2206qcl\n1\n\u2265 h\u0304.\n2\n< q \u0307cl >\n\n(25)\n\nThis guarantees in a general way that the uncertainties will come out right.\nThat does not make the above specific calculations irrelevant, however. The\nlatter show in a bottom-up way how the danger of inconsistency is avoided by\nthe dynamics of quantum mechanics. The paradox that p (or q) and the clock\ntime can be read off simultaneously, and that therefore (seemingly) both Eph\nand Tarr can be precisely predicted, is dissolved by showing how the validity\nof complementarity is guaranteed by the details of the dynamics. These calculations put Bohr's historical, qualitative arguments against Einstein on a firm\nquantitative basis.\nMoreover, our calculations exhibit a \"fine structure\" in the behavior of the\nuncertainties that does not follow from the general uncertainty relation. As\nbecomes clear from (8), (9), (16), (17), (23) and (24), the uncertainties in E and\nT are not time independent. Although their products always satisfy the general\nE-T uncertainty relation, the distribution of uncertainty over the quantities\nchanges in time. This leads to a remarkable conclusion: depending on when\nthe box measurement is performed, the resulting quantum description of the\nphoton differs-in spite of the fact that in the meantime the photon can have\nreached a distance of lightyears. This is another illustration of the leading idea\nof the later EPR thought experiment. We may safely assume that pondering the\nimplications of complementarity in the photon-box case has played a pivotal role\nin Einstein's dissatisfaction with quantum mechanics. At the same time, the\nexperiment nicely illustrates how quantum mechanics consistently deals with\nthis type of correlated systems.\n\nReferences\n[1] Bohr, N.
