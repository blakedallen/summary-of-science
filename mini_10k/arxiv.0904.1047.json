Introduction\nObservational and theoretical studies regarding the evolution of circumstellar disks\nand planetary systems have fueled a renewed interest in assessing how accurately we can\ndetermine the ages for solar-type field dwarfs (Mamajek et al. 2008, ; Meyer, this volume). For field stars we can place reasonable constraints on their effective temperatures,\nluminosities, and metallicities from spectroscopic, photometric, and astrometric measurements. Plotting these observables against theoretical evolutionary tracks allows us\nto infer ages and masses. However, for main sequence solar-type stars, the observational\nuncertainties in a star's HRD diagram position can be large enough that they encompass\na large fraction of the star's main sequence lifetime, even for stars with precise distances\nand metallicities (e.g. Nordstr\u00f6m et al. 2004; Valenti & Fischer 2005; Takeda et al. 2007).\nThe situation is worse for the hordes of stars lacking trigonometric parallaxes and metallicity estimates. For this reason, we are motivated to explore alternative age indicators\nbeyond deriving individual isochronal ages.\nIt has been long appreciated that solar-type stars lose angular momentum via a magnetized wind, spin down, and become less active during their main sequence phase (e.g.\nSkumanich 1972; Soderblom et al. 1991). Here I discuss recent efforts by the author and\ncollaborators to improve the estimation of ages for solar-type (\u223cF7-K2) field dwarfs using rotation/activity diagnostics. By \"activity diagnostics\", I will discuss two common\n375\n\n\f376\n\nEric E. Mamajek\n\n\u2032\nexamples: the Ca II H & K chromospheric activity index log RHK\n, and the X-ray-tobolometric luminosity ratio log(LX /Lbol )(= log RX ) in the 0.2-2.4 keV band (ROSAT\nband). For more exhaustive and wavelength-balanced reviews, especially from the perspective of the Sun's evolution, I refer the reader to G\u00fcdel (2007), Ayres (1997), and\nWalter & Barry (1991).\nFor the Sun, radiometric dating of the oldest meteorites have converged on an age\nwithin a few Myr of 4.57 Gyr (e.g. Baker et al. 2005). Pleasingly, solar models which\nmatch the observed helioseismological constraints (sound speed profiles, acoustic modes)\ncan produce the Sun with an age within a few percent of the meteoritic age (Houdek & Gough\n2008). For members of nearby young open clusters (e.g. the Pleiades, Hyades, etc.), detailed modelling of the HR diagram positions of the high-mass members, and HRD positions and Li-depletion pattern of the low-mass members, has led to age-dating with\nclaimed accuracy of \u223c5-15% (e.g. de Bruijne et al. 2001; Barrado y Navascu\u00e9s, et al.\n2004). Recent results for the small sample of solar-type stars which have been asteroseismologically observed and modeled are also yielding age uncertainties of typically\n\u223c5-15% (Th\u00e9venin et al. 2002; Eggenberger et al. 2004), with some claims of even \u223c1%\n(Mosser et al. 2008). While the observational data for these well-studied clusters and\nasteroseismological target stars is impeccable, the accuracy of the inferred cluster ages\nhinge on the input physics (e.g. treatment of convection, opacities, etc.) and abundances\nof the stellar evolution models, both of which are intimately tied to solar modeling efforts. While the Sun provides us with a \"gold\" age standard (<few % accuracy) and\nopen clusters and asteroseismological targets provide us \"silver\" age standards (\u223c15%),\nhow well can we estimate ages for solar-type field dwarfs using \"bronze\" indicators like\nrotation and activity?\n\n2. Ages from activity and/or rotation\n2.1. The chromospheric activity-age correlation\nIn solar-type stars, the majority of chromospheric and X-ray activity is believed to be\ngenerated as a result of the stellar magnetic dynamo. The strength of the dynamo and\nits ability to nonthermally heat the outer atmospheres of Sun-like stars is ultimately\ntied to stellar rotation \u2013 and more specifically \u2013 differential rotation (Noyes et al. 1984;\nDonahue et al. 1996). Both activity and rotation among Sun-like stars are observed to\ndecay with isochronal age (e.g. Wilson 1963; Skumanich 1972; Soderblom et al. 1991).\n\u2032\nAs an illustration of this, in Fig. 1 (left) we plot chromospheric activity log RHK\nvs. color\nfor the Sun and members of age-dated clusters (Mamajek & Hillenbrand 2008). Using\nour large modern database of activity and age estimates, we find shortcomings among\nall previous activity-age relations. The new fit to the cluster and field star activity-age\ndata is shown as a solid line in Fig. 1 (right):\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nlog \u03c4 = \u221238.053 \u2212 17.912 log RHK \u2212 1.6675 log (RHK )2\n\n(2.1)\n\nAs is obvious from the leftside figure of Fig. 1, there are color-dependent effects which\nforce us to dismiss a simple activity-age relationship as an oversimplification. Simply using\nthis activity-age polynomial can provide age estimates of \u223c\u00b10.25 dex or 60% accuracy\n(1\u03c3; uncertainties come from investigating the scatter in inferred ages among coeval\ncluster or binary samples), however color-dependent systematic effects will be present.\nMamajek & Hillenbrand (2008) were unable to find a simple way to parameterize age\nas a function of activity and color which simultaneously satisfied the available cluster,\n\n\fSolar-type dwarf ages\n\n377\n\n\u2032\nFigure 1. Left: Intrinsic B-V color vs. chromospheric activity index log RHK\nfor members of age\u2013\ndated clusters and the Sun (from Mamajek & Hillenbrand 2008). Sco-Cen members are typically\n\u223c5-17 Myr old (filled triangles), the Pleiades are \u223c130 Myr old (open squares), the Hyades are\n\u223c625 Myr old (filled circles), and M67 is \u223c4 Gyr old (open triangles; see Mamajek & Hillenbrand\n\u2032\n2008, and references therein). The median log RHK\nvalue for field dwarfs as a function of\n(B \u2212 V )0 is plotted. Right: Color-independent activity-age relationships from previous studies\nand Mamajek & Hillenbrand (2008). The best fit to the cluster data and a sample of isochronal\u2032\n\u2032\n2\nly-dated older field dwarfs is log (\u03c4 /yr) = -38.053 - 17.912 log RHK\n- 1.6675 log RHK\n(solid line).\n\u2032\nHowever cluster and binary log RHK\ndata suggests that one needs to allow for color-dependence.\n\u2032\nThis is best taken into account by converting log RHK\n\u2192 rotation \u2192 age via the Rossby number\nand a gyrochronology relation.\n\nbinary, and field star datasets. But there is hope in the form of the activity-rotation\ncorrelation (e.g. Noyes et al. 1984) and the gyrochronology relations (Barnes 2007).\n2.2. Ages from chromospheric activity via rotation\nTheoretical models exist for explaining the decay of rotation speeds among solar-type\nstars due to angular momentum loss via magnetized winds and changes in the moment of\ninertia of the star (Kawaler 1988). Some of the model parameters are poorly constrained,\n(e.g. mass loss, magnetic field geometry), but large rotation period datasets for clusters\ncan be used to constrain the parameters (Irwin, this volume). Empirically, however, one\ncan fit a series of simple curves in color-period-age space. These \"gyrochronology\" curves\nintroduced by Barnes (2007) and improved upon by Mamajek & Hillenbrand (2008) can\nbe used to derive ages from rotation rates with statistical accuracy of order \u223c15%. For\nthe solar-type dwarfs, Mamajek & Hillenbrand (2008) fit a gyrochronology relation for\nperiod P in days and age t in Myr:\nP (B \u2212V, t) = (0.407\u00b10.021)[(B \u2212V )o \u22120.495\u00b10.010]0.325\u00b10.024 (t/Myr)0.566\u00b10.008 (2.2)\nRotation rate can be tied to dynamo strength via the Rossby number (Ro ), which is\nobservationally defined as the rotation period divided by an estimate of the local convective turnover time just above the convective-radiative boundary (\u03c4c ; e.g. Noyes et al.\n1984). Using the best available data for solar-type dwarfs, Mamajek & Hillenbrand (2008)\nfind the strong correlation between the Rossby number and chromospheric activity for\n\u2032\n\"normal\" and \"inactive\" \u223cF7-K2 dwarfs (log RHK\n< -4.35) to be:\n\n\f378\n\nEric E. Mamajek\n\u2032\n\nlog RHK = \u22124.522 \u2212 0.337(Ro \u2212 0.814)\n(2.3)\nThrough applying the conversion activity \u2192 rotation \u2192 age via the Rossby number\nand gyrochronology, an analysis of (presumably) coeval stars in resolved binaries and star\nclusters suggests that the derived ages have precision of \u223c\u00b10.1-0.2 dex (\u223c25-50%; 1\u03c3).\n\u2032\nBy combining a gyrochronology relation with the log RHK\n-Rossby number correlation,\none can predict chromospheric activity as a function of color and age for solar-type dwarfs\n(\"gyrochromochrones\"; Fig. 2). When combining the activity vs. rotation and rotation vs.\n\u2032\nage relations, it becomes apparent that for a given chromospheric activity level log RHK\n,\nthe late F-type and early G-type stars are systematically younger than the late G-type\nand early K-type stars. In the future, it will be prudent to take into account the effects\nof metallicity in Fig. 2, and produce isochrones in mass-metallicity-activity.\n\nFigure 2. Predicted chromospheric activity levels as a function of age (\"gyrochromochrones\"),\nfrom combining the age-rotation relations (Eqn. 2.2) with the rotation-activity relations (Eqn.\n2.3 for age >100 Myr). Typical uncertainty bars are shown in the very active and active regimes,\nreflecting the r.m.s. in the Rossby number-activity fits, and typical photometric errors. The\nbehavior of the gyrochromochrones at the blue end (i.e. the obvious upturn) is not well-constrained, and is particularly sensitive to the c parameter in the gyrochronology fits. Figure from\nMamajek & Hillenbrand (2008).\n\n2.3. Coronal X-rays as an age indicator\nIt is clear that one can estimate useful stellar ages for solar-type dwarfs from rotation\nperiods (e.g. Barnes 2007), however rotation periods are currently difficult to measure\nin large numbers for all but the most active, starspotted stars (although periods can\nbe inferred from long-term monitoring of chromospheric emission; Donahue et al. 1996).\nFor these older stars lacking rotation periods, of order \u223c103.5 solar-type field dwarfs\nhave chromospheric activity measurements (predominantly from large surveys by e.g.\nHenry et al. 1996; Wright et al. 2004; Gray et al. 2006) to help us estimate their ages.\nHowever, another larger, and mostly untapped, stellar activity database exists for age\nestimation: X-ray fluxes.\nUsing ROSAT soft X-ray (0.2-2.4 keV) fluxes, Sterzik & Schmitt (1997) demonstrated\n\n\f379\n\nSolar-type dwarf ages\n\nthat coronal X-ray activity (log(LX /Lbol ) = log RX ) scales with chromospheric activity\n\u2032\n\u2032\nlog RHK\nover \u223c4 orders of magnitude in log RX and \u223c1 order of magnitude in log RHK\n.\nMamajek & Hillenbrand (2008) improved the correlation through including more highand low-activity stars, and provided an improved quantification of this correlation for\nsolar-type dwarfs:\n\u2032\n\nlog RHK = (\u22124.54 \u00b1 0.01) + (0.289 \u00b1 0.015) (log RX + 4.92)\n\u2032\nwith an r.m.s. scatter of 0.06 in log RHK\n. The inverse relation is:\n\u2032\n\nlog RX = (\u22124.90 \u00b1 0.04) + (3.46 \u00b1 0.18) (log RHK + 4.53)\n\n(2.4)\n\n(2.5)\n\nwith an r.m.s. of 0.19 dex (\u223c55%) in log RX . Equation 2.5 is statistically consistent with\nthe relation found by Sterzik & Schmitt (1997), but our uncertainties are \u223c2\u00d7 smaller.\nAs with the chromospheric activity, their is a strong correlation between coronal X-ray\nactivity and rotation via the Rossby number:\nRo = (0.86 \u00b1 0.02) \u2212 (0.79 \u00b1 0.05) (log RX + 4.83)\n(2.6)\nThis best fit appears to be useful over \u223c4 orders of magnitude in log RX (-7 < log RX\n< -4). The fit is similar to the linear-log fit quoted by Hempelmann et al. (1995), but is\nseverely at odds with the oft-cited log RX vs. log Ro fit quoted by Randich et al. (1996).\nHence, one can relate X-ray fluxes to rotation periods via the Rossby number (typically\n\u223c0.25 1\u03c3 accuracy in Ro ), and estimate ages from the periods via a gyrochronology\nrelation. The typical spread in log RX as a function of age is \u00b1 0.4 dex (1\u03c3) and should\nbe factored into the age uncertainty. It appears that a few hundred second X-ray snapshot\n\u2032\nwith an X-ray satellite can be used to predict the multi-decadal average value of log RHK\nto within \u00b1 0.1 (1\u03c3) accuracy (minimum age precision \u223c30-50%). A star with X-ray\nemission similar to that of the Sun can be seen out to \u223c15 pc in the ROSAT All-Sky\nSurvey, and younger, more active stars can be seen to larger distances. Using X-ray\nemission measured by the ROSAT All-Sky Survey, one should (in principle) be able to\nderive useful ages for \u223c102\u22123 solar-type field dwarfs in the solar neighborhood.\n\u2032\nThe very active stars (log RHK\n> -4.35; log RX > -4.0) have negligible correlation\nbetween rotation and activity (i.e. the \"saturated\" regime). So while setting upper limits\nto ages might be fruitful in the saturated regime, quoting exact ages appears not to be.\n\n3. Implications for nearby Sun-like field dwarfs\nWhat we have constructed are useful empirical relations between stellar measurements,\nwhich when combined, yield a parameter more difficult to measure: age. In future work,\nwe would like to understand the physics underlying these empirical relations in terms of\nhow it constrains stellar dynamo theory (e.g. Montesinos et al. 2001) and the evolution\nof stellar angular momentum (e.g. Kawaler 1988). For the time being, let us use our new\nand improved rotation-activity-age tools to see what their implications are.\nWe have already seen that the evolution of activity appears to be fairly color/massdependent among solar-type dwarfs (Fig. 2), contrary to previous studies which employed\na color/mass-independent activity-age correlation. As a first use of our activity \u2192 rotation \u2192 age calibrations, we constructed a histogram of the chromospheric activityderived ages for a volume-limited (d < 16 pc) sample of the nearest 108 solar-type\n\u2032\ndwarfs to the Sun\u2020. A table of the names, parallaxes, B-V colors, log RHK\nvalues, abso\u2020 The ages for these nearest solar-type dwarfs will be of astrobiological interest for proposed\n\n\f380\n\nEric E. Mamajek\n\nSun\n\n\u2032\nFigure 3. Left: log RX vs. log RHK\nfor solar-type dwarfs with known rotation periods and\nchromospheric and X-ray activity levels (from Mamajek & Hillenbrand 2008). Stars from\nDonahue et al. (1996) and Baliunas et al. (1996) with well-determined periods also have dark\nXs and conveniently provide an X-ray unbiased sample via the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. Shaded\n\u2032\ncolor bins are illustrated in the legend. The Solar X-ray and log RHK\ndatum is described in\nMamajek & Hillenbrand (2008). Right: log RX vs. Rossby number Ro for stars in our sample of\nsolar-type stars with known rotation periods and chromospheric and X-ray activity levels (from\nMamajek & Hillenbrand 2008). Donahue-Baliunas stars with well-determined periods also have\ndark Xs. Previously published RX vs. Ro fits are drawn: cyan long-dashed line is a log-log\nfit from Randich et al. (1996), magenta dot-dashed line is a log-log fit from Hempelmann et al.\n(1995), and the green dashed line is a linear-log fit from Hempelmann et al. (1995). Our new\nlog-linear fit for stars in the range -7 < log RX < -4 is the solid dark line, consistent with the\nHempelmann linear-log relation. Saturated X-ray emission (log RX > -4) is consistent with Ro\n< 0.5.\n\nlute magnitudes, spectral types, and inferred ages for the sample stars is given in Table\n13 of Mamajek & Hillenbrand (2008). We plot the fruits of this effort as a histogram\nof inferred ages in Figure 4. The histogram can not be directly interpreted as a \"starformation history\" at this time, as we have not accounted for the effects of kinematic\ndisk-heating, the loss of some older stars due to stellar evolution (given the constraint\nthat the \"dwarf\" stars must lie within 1 mag of the main sequence), and the effects of\nmetallicity on the sample. As these effects will mostly conspire to skew our conclusions\nregarding the old end of the histogram (i.e. evolved and/or metal-poor and/or highvelocity stars), we focus on the stars younger than the Sun. First, we note that when a\nsimple activity \u2192 age relation is adopted, one sees a pronounced dip in the age histogram\nat age \u223c2-3 Gyr, right in the region of the \"Vaughan-Preston gap\" (Vaughan & Preston\n1980). One one derives age using the recommended activity \u2192 rotation \u2192 age (via the\nRossby number and revised gyrochronology relations), one gets a much flatter age distribution between 0-6 Gyr. As our color-magnitude selection biases should have negligible\nimpact on the age distribution of these young to middle-aged dwarfs, it appears that the\nhistogram is consistent with a more-or-less flat star-formation history over the past \u223c5\nGyr or so. The histogram is in disagreement with assertions in previous historical studies\n(e.g. Barry 1988, which used an activity-age relation) which concluded that there has\nbeen a recent enhancement of the stellar birth-rate in the past \u223cGyr, which followed a\nmissions designed to image and take spectra of extrasolar terrestrial planets, like the TPF and\nDarwin (Kaltenegger et al. 2007) and New Worlds Observer (Cash et al. 2005)\n\n\fSolar-type dwarf ages\n\n381\n\nlower birth-rate \u223c2-3 Gyr ago. Applying our age-estimation methods to a larger sample\nof the nearest solar-type stars out to \u223c25-40 pc should place our conclusions on firmer\nstatistical footing.\nThese techniques should also be prove valuable for more accurately assessing the ages\nof extrasolar planetary systems (Mamajek & Slipski, in prep.) and dusty debris disk\nsystems (Hillenbrand et al., in prep.).\n\nFigure 4. Histogram of inferred ages for the nearest 108 solar-type dwarfs (F7-K2V) within\n16 pc (from Mamajek & Hillenbrand 2008). Dashed histogram is for ages inferred directly from\nchromospheric activity using equation 3. Solid histogram is for ages derived from converting\n\u2032\nactivity log RHK\nto rotation period, then converting rotation period and color to age via the\nRossby number and revised gyro relation.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe author collaborated with Lynne Hillenbrand on much of the material presented\nfor this talk (presented in Mamajek & Hillenbrand 2008), and acknowledges helpful\nconversations with D.

Soderblom: First, maybe it's a coincidence, but the line for Rossby number = 1 runs\nright down the middle of the \"Vaughan-Preston gap,\" and that may explain the build-up\n\u2032\nof stars at log RHK\n= \u22124.5. Second, have you compared activity ages to isochrones ages?\nWhen I do I see zero correlation.\nE. Mamajek: Rossby number = 1 depends on the choice of convective overturn time,\nwhich differs by a factor of a few among the models. I adopted those from Noyes et\nal. (1984). The scatter between ages from activity or gyrochronology and those from\nisochrones (Valenti & Fischer 2005) is large; however, Valenti has suggested that Takeda\net al. (2007) ages are to be preferred, but I have not yet compared to those.\nF. Walter: The Rossby number is a convenient way to sweep a lot of our ignorance\nabout convection under the rug (or at least into a single parameter). How well do we\nreally understand convective turnover timescales in convective stars, and how might this\nuncertainty affect the details of your activity-age relations?\nE. Mamajek: Modelers have evaluated convective turnover times differently \u2013 primarily\nat different depths with respect to the base of the convection zone \u2013 but there appears to\nbroad agreement in the relative turnover times for main sequence stars as a function of\nmass. Combining the theoretical turnover times with the observed rotation and activity\ndata shows that a strong correlation between Rossby number and activity exists over a\nwide range of parameter space for solar-type dwarfs when one uses MLT models with \u03b1\n= 1.9 (see Noyes et al. 1984 and Montesinos et al. 2001). Deriving rough ages for solartype dwarfs using activity is then supported by two empirical correlations: the activityrotation relation (via the Rossby number) and the rotation-age relation (gyrochronology;\nsee talk by S. Barnes).\n\n\f"}
