The operator can be realized in cubic superstring field\ntheory as a kinetic operator in the background of an identity-based solution. For\na particular type of the deformed BRST operators, we find a homotopy operator\nand discuss its relationship to the cohomology in a similar way to the bosonic case,\nwhich has been elaborated by the authors.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nString field theory (SFT) has been used in exploring the non-perturbative vacuum in\nstring theory. After the success of the Schnabl solution [1], strategy of constructing various classical solutions in SFT has been developed in terms of \"KBc subalgebra\"[2] and\nits extension. 1 In modified cubic superstring field theory, the Erler solution [4] was constructed as a straightforward extension of the Schnabl solution. These solutions are\nimpressive, in particular, in the sense that the vacuum energy was evaluated exactly and\nturned out to be equal to the D-brane tension. Furthermore, homotopy operators for the\nBRST operators at the solutions have been constructed as in [5], and it shows the empty\ncohomology at all ghost number sectors.\nOn the other hand, another type of classical solutions starting from [6] have been\ninvestigated, which are called a class of \"identity-based solutions.\" They are constructed\nby half-integrations of the BRST current and the c-ghost with particular functions on\nthe identity state. Although it is difficult to evaluate its vacuum energy directly due to\na singular property of the identity state, 2 the cohomology of the BRST operator of the\ntheory around the solution was investigated and turned out to be empty in the ghost\nnumber one sector [10], which provides evidence that the solution represents the tachyon\nvacuum in bosonic SFT. Recently, a homotopy operator for the BRST operator was\nobtained [11] and it was applied to show moduli-independence of one loop vacuum energy\nat the solution.\nIt is natural to ask how the identity-based solutions in bosonic SFT can be extended to\nsolutions in super SFT. Marginal solutions given in [6] were already extended to solutions\nin superstring field theory in [12, 13]. Here, we will extend scalar solutions given in [6] to\nsolutions in modified cubic superstring field theory [14, 15, 16].\nActually, apart from the context of SFT, we begin with a construction of deformed\nBRST operators using integration of the BRST current in superstring theory with some\nweighting function. To find a nilpotent operator, it is necessary to introduce two other\noperators in terms of ghost fields. The resulting nilpotent deformed BRST operator has a\nsimilar form to that of the theory expanded around the identity-based solution in bosonic\nSFT. Using a method in [11], we will show that there exists a homotopy operator for a\nparticular weighting function, which is associated with the tachyon vacuum solution in\nbosonic SFT.\nThe situation with respect to the deformed BRST operators is very similar to the\nbosonic SFT. We expect that it should correspond to some classical solutions in super\nSFT in some sense. Indeed, we will construct a class of identity-based solutions using halfintegration of the BRST current in modified cubic superstring field theory. In the theory\naround the solution, the deformed BRST operator with the same function is reproduced.\nThe existence of a homotopy operator shows that the solution is nontrivial although it can\n1\n2\n\nSee [3] and references therein, for example.\nNumerical quantitative evidences have been obtained indirectly up to level 26 [7, 8, 9].\n\n1\n\n\fbe rewritten as a pure gauge form at least formally. However, its physical interpretation\nis unclear so far because the obtained solution is in the theory on a BPS D-brane.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we will construct a class of\ndeformed BRST operators. In \u00a73, we will find their homotopy operators in the case of\nparticular functions and discuss the relationship to the conventional BRST cohomology.\nIn \u00a74, we will construct corresponding solutions in cubic super SFT. Finally, we will give\nconcluding remarks in \u00a75. Some technical details for computations are given in Appendix\nA and we will present a summary of the BRST cohomology in Neveu-Schwarz (NS) 0picture and Ramond (R) (\u22121/2)-picture in Appendix B.\n\n2\n\nDeformed BRST operators\n\nWe consider a deformation of the BRST operator in superstring theory using b, c and \u03b2,\n\u03b3 ghosts:\nQ\u2032 = Q(f ) + C(g) + \u0398(h),\nwhere each operator is defined by an integration along the unit circle |z| = 1,\nI\ndz\nQ(f ) =\nf (z) jB (z),\n2\u03c0i\nI\ndz\nC(g) =\ng(z) c(z),\n2\u03c0i\nI\ndz\n\u0398(h) =\nh(z) \u03b8(z).\n2\u03c0i\n\n(2.1)\n\n(2.2)\n(2.3)\n(2.4)\n\nHere, f (z), g(z) and h(z) are some weighting functions, and jB (z) and c(z) are the BRST\ncurrent and the ghost field. \u03b8(z) is defined by\n\u03b8(z) = c\u03b2\u03b3(z) \u2212 \u2202c(z),\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhich is a primary field with dimension 0.\nFirst, we will show that if we impose nilpotency on the operator Q\u2032 , the functions g(z)\nand h(z) can be related to f (z), and the resulting nilpotent operator is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 \u03bb\n1\n2 \u03bb\n\u2032\n\u03bb\n(2.6)\nQ = Q(e ) + C \u2212 (\u2202\u03bb) e + \u0398 \u2212 \u2202e .\n2\n4\nTo find the nilpotent deformed BRST operator, it is necessary to calculate the operator\nproduct expansion (OPE) among jB (z), c(z) and \u03b8(z).

Comparing (2.30) with the derivative of (2.29), we obtain the following differential\nequations:\nd\nft = \u03bbft ,\ndt\nd\ngt = \u2212\u2202ft \u2202\u03bb + \u03bbgt ,\ndt\n1\nd\nht = \u2212 ft \u2202\u03bb + ht \u03bb.\ndt\n4\n\n(2.31)\n(2.32)\n(2.33)\n\nWe can easily solve these equations under the initial conditions, ft=0 = 1, gt=0 = 0, ht=0 =\n0. Finally, setting t = 1, we find that the nilpotent BRST operator (2.6) is written as a\nsimilarity transformation:\nQ\u2032 = eq(\u03bb) QB e\u2212q(\u03bb) .\n\n3\n\n(2.34)\n\nHomotopy operators in superstring theory\n\nHere, we construct a homotopy operator for the deformed BRST operator constructed in\n\u00a72 with a particular function \u03bb.\nFirstly, we note that the following OPEs:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3/2\n3\n1\n1\njB (y)b(z) \u223c\n\u2212bc(z)\n\u2212\n+\n\u03b2\u03b3(z)\n+\nT (z),\n(y \u2212 z)3 (y \u2212 z)2\n4\ny\u2212z\n5\n\n(3.1)\n\n\f1\n,\ny\u2212z\n1\n1\n\u03b8(y)b(z) \u223c\n+\n\u03b2\u03b3(z),\n2\n(y \u2212 z)\ny\u2212z\n\n(3.2)\n\nc(y)b(z) \u223c\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhich lead to following anti-commutation relations:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3\n3 2\n\u2202 f (z) + \u2202f (z) \u2212bc(z) \u2212 \u03b2\u03b3(z) + f (z)T (z),\n{Q(f ), b(z)} =\n4\n4\n{C(g), b(z)} = g(z),\n{\u0398(h), b(z)} = \u2202h(z) + h(z)\u03b2\u03b3(z).\n\n(3.4)\n(3.5)\n(3.6)\n\nHence, anti-commutator of Q\u2032 (2.6) and b(z) is calculated as\n{Q\u2032 , b(z)} =\n\n1 2\n(\u2202 \u03bb(z))e\u03bb(z) + (\u2202\u03bb(z))e\u03bb(z) jgh (z) + e\u03bb(z) T (z).\n2\n\n(3.7)\n\nIf we choose the function \u03bb(z) such that e\u03bb(z) has a second order zero z0 , the above\nrelation implies that {Q\u2032 , b(z)} becomes a c-number at z = z0 . For example, let us take\nthe function \u03bb = hla :\n\u0010\n\u0011\na\nhla (z) = log 1 \u2212 (\u22121)l (z l \u2212 (\u22121)l z \u2212l )2 ,\n(a \u2265 \u22121/2; l = 1, 2, 3, * * * ) (3.8)\n2\nl\n\nwhich was adopted in [6, 10] for identity-based solutions in bosonic SFT. Although eha\nl\ndoes not have second order zeros in the case a > \u22121/2, eha=\u22121/2 has second order zeros at\nk\u22121\n2k\u22121\nzk = ei l \u03c0 for odd l and zk = ei 2l \u03c0 for even l (k = 1, 2, * * * , 2l), which are solutions to\nz 2l + (\u22121)l = 0. Namely, the deformed BRST operator Q\u2032 with the function \u03bb = hla=\u22121/2\nhas a homotopy operator \u00c2, such as\n{Q\u2032 , \u00c2} = 1,\n\n\u00c22 = 0.\n\n(3.9)\n\nIn this case, the operator \u00c2, which is BPZ even and Hermitian operator, is explicitly,\ngiven by\n\u00c2 =\n\n2l\nX\n\nak l\u22122 zk2 b(zk ),\n\n2l\nX\n\nak = 1,\n\n(3.10)\n\nk=1\n\nk=1\n\nwhere\nak = al\u2212k+2 , (k = 1, 2, * * * , l + 1);\n\nak = a3l\u2212k+2 , (k = l + 2, l + 3, * * * , 2l) (3.11)\n\nfor odd l,\nak = al\u2212k+1, (k = 1, 2, * * * , l);\n\nak = a3l\u2212k+1 , (k = l + 1, l + 2, * * * , 2l)\n\n(3.12)\n\nfor even l and ak \u2208 R (k = 1, 2, * * * , 2l). The above \u00c2 is exactly the same form as a\nbosonic counterpart in [11]. In the same way, using the commutation relations obtained\n6\n\n\fby differentiating (3.7), homotopy operators for the function such that e\u03bb has higher-order\nzeros investigated in [17] can be also constructed as in the bosonic case [11].\nThe existence of a homotopy operator \u00c2 such as (3.9) implies that the deformed BRST\noperator Q\u2032 has vanishing cohomology:\nQ\u2032 \u03c8 = 0\n\n\u03c8 = Q\u2032 (\u00c2\u03c8).\n\n\u21d4\n\n(3.13)\n\nOn the other hand, Q\u2032 can be expressed as a similarity transformation of the conventional\nl\nl\nQB : Q\u2032 = eq(h\u22121/2 ) QB e\u2212q(h\u22121/2 ) from (2.34) and, at least formally, we have\nQB \u03a8 = 0\n\n\u21d4\n\nl\n\nQ\u2032 (eq(h\u22121/2 ) \u03a8) = 0\n\n\u21d4\n\nl\n\nl\n\neq(h\u22121/2 ) \u03a8 = Q\u2032 (\u00c2eq(h\u22121/2 ) \u03a8).\n\n(3.14)\n\nTherefore, the nontrivial part of QB -cohomology also becomes trivial in terms of Q\u2032 l\ncohomology by multiplying eq(h\u22121/2 ) . To find out what is happening, let us more concretely\nl\nsee products of eq(h\u22121/2 ) and the QB -closed states in 0-picture (\u00a7B.1) and (\u22121/2)-picture\n(\u00a7B.2), which are pictures for the NS and R sector, respectively, in modified cubic superstring field theory. We decompose q(hl\u22121/2 ) to positive, zero and negative mode part:\nq(hl\u22121/2 ) = q (+) (hl\u22121/2 ) + q (0) (hl\u22121/2 ) + q (\u2212) (hl\u22121/2 ),\n\n(3.15)\n\nwhere\nq\n\n(0)\n\n(hl\u22121/2 )\n\n= \u2212q0 log 4,\n\nq\n\n(\u00b1)\n\n(hl\u22121/2 )\n\n=\u2212\n\nP\n\n\u221e\nX\n(\u22121)n(l+1)\nn=1\n\nn\n\nq\u00b12nl ,\n\n(3.16)\n\n\u2212n\u22121\nfor jgh (z) =\nand (3.8).

By multiplying the homotopy operator \u00c2 (3.10) and move it to\nthe right, we have\n!\n\u221e\nX\n1\nU \u00c2(* * * ) = 0,\n(3.22)\n\u00c2U(* * * ) = exp \u2212\nn\nn=1\nP\u221e\n\n(\u22121)n(l+1)\n\nz\nn\nwhere we have used [qn , bm ] = \u2212bn+m , which leads to U \u22121 b(z)U = e\u2212 n=1\nb(z).\nThe relation (3.22) implies that, for the nontrivial part |\u03c6i in QB -cohomology in the NS\nl\nand R sector, all coefficients of \u00c2eq(h\u22121/2 ) |\u03c6i vanish in the Fock space. On the other hand,\nl\nthe last equation in (3.14) indicates the relation |\u03c6i = Q\u2032 \u00c2eq(h\u22121/2 ) |\u03c6i, which may be\ninterpreted that |\u03c6i is Q\u2032 -exact outside the Fock space. Here, we regard a space in which\nstates are expressed as a linear combination of states made of b\u2212n , c\u2212m (n \u2265 2, m \u2265 \u22121) on\nthe conformal vacuum |0ibc in the bc ghost sector and \u03b2\u2212r , \u03b3\u2212s (r \u2265 P +3/2, s \u2265 \u2212P \u22121/2)\non |P i\u03b2\u03b3 in the \u03b2\u03b3 ghost sector in P -picture as \"the Fock space.\" Although we should\ndefine it as a completion with respect to an appropriate norm mathematically, we leave it\nl\nambiguous at this stage. Intuitively, we could interpret that \u00c2eq(h\u22121/2 ) \u03c6 weakly converges\nto zero but not in a strong sense.\n\u22122nl\n\nFor comparison, let us comment on a similar situation on the identity-based solution\nwith hla in the bosonic SFT investigated in [11]. The nontrivial part |\u03c6i of Q\u2032 -cohomology\nin terms of the Fock space found in [10] can be regarded as Q\u2032 -exact outside the Fock\nspace by the homotopy operator \u00c2. However, the similarity transformation from the\nl\nl\nKato-Ogawa BRST operator: Q\u2032 = eq(ha ) QB e\u2212q(ha ) becomes ill-defined at a = \u22121/2 in the\nbosonic case. In fact, Ul included in |\u03c6i [11, 10] is different from the above U (3.18).\n\n4\n\nClassical solutions in modified cubic superstring\nfield theory\n\nIn \u00a72, we have constructed a class of deformed BRST operators, which are nilpotent. In\n\u00a73, we have constructed homotopy operators at the boundary of the parameter a included\nin the associated functions hla . We expect that they may be realized as BRST operators\n8\n\n\fat appropriate classical solutions in superstring field theory. In this section, we show that\nit is indeed the case in the framework of modified cubic superstring field theory.\nUsing the analogy of a class of identity-based solutions [6] in bosonic string field theory,\nwe expect that a string field, which is given by\nAc = QL (f )I + CL (g)I + \u0398L (h)I\n\n(4.1)\n\nwith appropriate functions: f, g and h, may be a classical solution in superstring field\ntheory. Here, we have used half integrations:\nZ\nZ\nZ\ndz\ndz\ndz\nQL (f ) =\nf (z)jB (z), CL (g) =\ng(z)c(z), \u0398L (h) =\nh(z)\u03b8(z), (4.2)\nCL 2\u03c0i\nCL 2\u03c0i\nCL 2\u03c0i\nwhere the subscript CL for each integral denotes a half unit circle corresponding to a left\nhalf of an open string. I denotes the identity state, given by the total (matter+ghost)\nVirasoro generators corresponding to a conformal map 2z/(1 \u2212 z 2 ) in the same way as\nbosonic open SFT.\nThe string field Ac (4.1) has the ghost number one and the picture number zero in\nthe NS sector. Therefore, it is natural to treat it in the framework of modified cubic\nsuperstring field theory, whose action is\nS[A, \u03a8] =\n\n1\n1\n1\nhA, Y\u22122 QB Ai + hA, Y\u22122A \u2217 Ai + h\u03a8, Y QB \u03a8i + hA, Y \u03a8 \u2217 \u03a8i. (4.3)\n2\n3\n2\n\nIn the above, A and \u03a8 are string fields in the NS and R sector, respectively. Y\u22122 and Y\nare inverse picture changing operators with the picture number \u22122 and \u22121, respectively,\ninserted at the midpoint. h * , * i denotes the BPZ inner product in the small Hilbert\nspace. (Here, we use the (\u03b2, \u03b3) system instead of (\u03be, \u03b7, \u03c6)-system for the superghost\nsector in terms of the worldsheet CFT.) The equations of motion for the action (4.3) are\nY\u22122 (QB A + A \u2217 A) + Y \u03a8 \u2217 \u03a8 = 0,\n\nY (QB \u03a8 + A \u2217 \u03a8 + \u03a8 \u2217 A) = 0.\n\n(4.4)\n\nIn the following, we will find the string field Ac (4.1) in the NS sector, which satisfies\nQB Ac + Ac \u2217 Ac = 0,\n\n(4.5)\n\nby choosing appropriate functions: f, g and h. Our strategy is almost the same as the\nbosonic case elaborated in [6]. For a primary field \u03c3 with conformal dimension h, we\nhave a relation from the definition of the star product of string fields in open SFT with a\nmidpoint interaction:\n(\u03a3R (F )B1 ) \u2217 B2 = \u2212(\u22121)|\u03c3||B1 | B1 \u2217 (\u03a3L (F )B2 ),\n\n(4.6)\n\nwhere \u03a3L (F ) and \u03a3R (F ) are half integrations of a primary field \u03c3(z) with the conformal\ndimension h multiplied by a function F (z) such as F (\u22121/z) = (z 2 )1\u2212h F (z):\nZ\nZ\ndz\ndz\n\u03a3L (F ) =\nF (z)\u03c3(z), \u03a3R (F ) =\nF (z)\u03c3(z),\n(4.7)\nCL 2\u03c0i\nCR 2\u03c0i\n9\n\n\fand B1 , B2 are any string fields. CL (CR ) denotes a half unit circle with positive (negative)\nreal part. (\u22121)|\u03c3||B1 | in (4.6) is \u22121 in the case that both \u03c3(z) and B1 are Grassmann odd\nand +1 otherwise. In the case that B1 and/or B2 are the identity state, which is the\nidentity element with respect to the star product, we have\n\u03a3R (F )I = \u2212\u03a3L (F )I,\n(\u03a3L (F )I) \u2217 B = \u03a3L (F )B,\n\nB \u2217 (\u03a3L (F )I) = \u2212(\u22121)\n\n|\u03c3||B|\n\n\u03a3R (F )B.\n\n(4.8)\n(4.9)\n\nAssuming relations of functions:\nf (\u22121/z) = f (z),\n\ng(\u22121/z) = z 4 g(z),\n\nh(\u22121/z) = z 2 h(z),\n\n(4.10)\n\nand noting that jB (z), c(z) and \u03b8(z) are primary fields with conformal dimension 1, \u22121\nand 0, respectively, the half integrations included in the string field (4.1) are the same\nform as in (4.7).

Using\nQB I = 0, (A.10) and (4.11), the left hand side of (4.5) is\nQB Ac + Ac \u2217 Ac\n\u0014n\n\u0011o n\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n1 \u0011\u0011o\n3\n+ QB , \u0398L (1 + f ) h + \u2202f\n= QB , CL (1 + f )g + (\u2202f )2 + h\u2202f\n4\n4\n\u0015\n7\n1\n3\n\u2212 {\u0398L (\u2202f ), \u0398L (\u2202f )} + {\u0398L (h), \u0398L (h)} \u2212 {\u0398L (\u2202f ), \u0398L (h)} I. (4.12)\n32\n2\n4\nTherefore, introducing a function \u03bb, we have\nf = e\u03bb \u2212 1,\n\n1\ng = \u2212 (\u2202\u03bb)2 e\u03bb ,\n2\n\n1\nh = \u2212 (\u2202\u03bb)e\u03bb ,\n4\n\n(4.13)\n\nby imposing (4.5). The function \u03bb should satisfy\n\u03bb(\u22121/z) = \u03bb(z),\n\n\u03bb(\u00b1i) = 0,\n\nin order to guarantee the assumptions for functions (4.10) and f (\u00b1i) = 0.\n10\n\n(4.14)\n\n\fTherefore, the relation (4.5) implies that the string field Ac (4.1) with (4.13) and (4.14)\nin the NS sector (and vanishing string field in the R sector) can be regarded as a classical\nsolution to the equations of motion (4.4). The action around the solution is obtained by\nre-expanding (4.3) (and subtracting the S[Ac , 0]) as\nS \u2032 [A, \u03a8] \u2261 S[A + Ac , \u03a8] \u2212 S[Ac , 0]\n1\n1\n1\nhA, Y\u22122Q\u2032 Ai + hA, Y\u22122 A \u2217 Ai + h\u03a8, Y Q\u2032 \u03a8i + hA, Y \u03a8 \u2217 \u03a8i, (4.15)\n=\n2\n3\n2\nwhere the BRST operator Q\u2032 at the solution is defined by\nQ\u2032 B = QB B + Ac \u2217 B \u2212 (\u22121)|B| B \u2217 Ac\n\n(4.16)\n\nfor a string field B. ((\u22121)|B| denotes the Grassmann parity of the string field B.) Substituting the concrete expression of Ac to the above formula and using the relations (4.9),\nthe BRST operator Q\u2032 at the solution Ac is obtained:\nQ\u2032 = QB + (QL (f ) + CL (g) + \u0398L (h)) + (QR (f ) + CR (g) + \u0398R (h))\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n\u03bb\n2 \u03bb\n\u03bb\n= Q(e ) + C \u2212 (\u2202\u03bb) e + \u0398 \u2212 (\u2202\u03bb)e ,\n2\n4\n\n(4.17)\n\nwhere the last expression is given by integrations along a full circle. It is equal to the\ndeformed BRST operator (2.6) investigated in \u00a72.\n\nNext, let us consider the relation to the expression using a similarity transformation:\nQ = eq(\u03bb) QB e\u2212q(\u03bb) (2.34). As in the case of bosonic SFT, one expects that Ac may be\nrelated to eqL (\u03bb)I QB e\u2212qL (\u03bb)I , where the symbol \"\u2217\" for the star product among string fields\nis omitted. For the half integrations of jgh :\nZ\nZ\ndz\ndz\n\u03bb(z)jgh (z), qR (\u03bb) =\n\u03bb(z)jgh (z),\n(4.18)\nqL (\u03bb) =\nCR 2\u03c0i\nCL 2\u03c0i\n\u2032\n\nwe note that (4.6) should be modified such as\n(qR (\u03bb)B1 ) \u2217 B2 = \u2212B1 \u2217 (qL (\u03bb)B2 ) + k(\u03bb)B1 \u2217 B2 ,\n\nk(\u03bb) =\n\nZ\n\nCL\n\ndz \u03bb(z)\n, (4.19)\n2\u03c0i z\n\nfor \u03bb(\u22121/z) = \u03bb(z) because the ghost number current jgh = \u2212bc \u2212 \u03b2\u03b3 is not primary and\nis transformed as jgh (z) = w 2 jgh (w) \u2212 w for w = \u22121/z. Then, corresponding to (4.8) and\n(4.9), we have the relations:\nqR (\u03bb)I = \u2212qL (\u03bb)I + k(\u03bb)I,\n\n(qL (\u03bb)I) \u2217 B = qL (\u03bb)B.\n\n(4.20)\n\nUsing the second equation in the above and the commutation relations given in (A.14),\n(A.15), (A.16) and (A.17), we can calculate as follows:\n!\n\u221e\nX\n1\n(adqL (\u03bb) )k QB I\neqL (\u03bb)I QB e\u2212qL (\u03bb)I = (eqL (\u03bb) QB e\u2212qL (\u03bb) )I =\nk!\nk=1\n11\n\n\f=\n\n\u0012\n\nQL\n\n\u0013\n\u0001 1\n\u0001\n1\n2 \u03bb\n\u03bb\ne \u2212 1 \u2212 CL (\u2202\u03bb) e \u2212 \u0398L (\u2202\u03bb)e\nI, (4.21)\n2\n4\n\u03bb\n\n\u0001\n\nfor a function \u03bb such as (4.14). (We have denoted as adX Y \u2261 [X, Y ].) The last expression\nin (4.21) is equal to Ac (4.1) with (4.13). Namely, the identity-based solution Ac in the\nNS sector, constructed in this section, can be rewritten as a pure gauge form. Here we\nnote that the action (4.3) is invariant under a part of gauge transformations of string\nfields in the NS and R sector:\nA\u2032 = e\u2212\u039b A e\u039b + e\u2212\u039b QB e\u039b ,\n\n\u03a8\u2032 = e\u2212\u039b \u03a8 e\u039b ,\n\n(4.22)\n\nwith a gauge parameter string field \u039b, which is Grassmann even and has ghost number\nzero and picture number zero.\nOne may think that the solution Ac is trivial from the relation (4.21). However, the\naction around the solution given in (4.15) is nontrivially different from the original one\n(4.3) for a particular type of the function \u03bb, for example, \u03bb = hla=\u22121/2 (3.8), because\nthe BRST operator Q\u2032 (4.17) becomes cohomologically trivial due to the existence of a\nhomotopy operator \u00c2 (3.9) as was investigated in \u00a73.\n\nIn the case of bosonic SFT, for \u03bb = hla=\u22121/2 , the pure gauge form of the identity-based\nsolution becomes singular [6] because the operator e\u00b1qL (\u03bb) becomes ill-defined due to the\ndivergent factor in the normal ordered expression. It is caused by the singular OPE of\nthe ghost number current: jgh (y)jgh (z) \u223c (y \u2212 z)\u22122 . On the other hand, in the case of\nsuperstring field theory, jgh (y)jgh (z) (y \u2192 z) is regular because the ghost number current\nincluded in (4.21) is jgh = \u2212bc\u2212\u03b2\u03b3 instead of \u2212bc. Therefore, the pure gauge form, which\nis the first expression in (4.21), is not singular even for \u03bb = hla=\u22121/2 in this sense. If we\nregard the pure gauge form in (4.21) as well-defined, we can interpret that the solution\nAc in modified cubic superstring field theory corresponds to the solution: \u03a6c = \u2212qL (\u03bb)I\nin Berkovits' WZW-like superstring field theory [18] because Ac is in the small Hilbert\nspace and the equation of motion \u03b70 (e\u2212\u03a6c QB e\u03a6c ) = 0 is satisfied. In this case, it is also\npure gauge because it can be rewritten as \u03a6c = \u03b70 (\u2212\u03be0 qL (\u03bb)I) in the large Hilbert space.\n\n5\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nIn this paper, we have constructed a class of deformed BRST operators Q\u2032 , which is\nnilpotent and has ghost number one in the context of RNS formalism of open superstring.\nThe operator Q\u2032 is given by integrations with the BRST current, c ghost, \u03b8 \u2261 c\u03b2\u03b3 \u2212 \u2202c\nand an appropriate function \u03bb. In the case of a particular type function \u03bb, we have found\na homotopy operator for Q\u2032 such as {Q\u2032 , \u00c2} = 1, which implies that the cohomology of\nQ\u2032 vanishes.\nIn the framework of modified cubic superstring field theory, we have constructed an\nidentity-based solution Ac in the NS sector, in the theory around which the BRST operator coincides with the deformed BRST operator, i.e., Q\u2032 = QB + [Ac , * }\u2217. Therefore,\n12\n\n\fcorresponding to a particular type of the function such as \u03bb = hla=\u22121/2 , the solution\nseems to be nontrivial and the vanishing cohomology of Q\u2032 might imply that the D-brane\nvanishes as in the case of bosonic SFT.\nThe deformed BRST operator Q\u2032 can be re-expressed as a similarity transform of\nthe conventional BRST operator QB using the integration of the ghost number current\njgh = \u2212bc \u2212 \u03b2\u03b3 with the function \u03bb: Q\u2032 = eq(\u03bb) QB e\u2212q(\u03bb) . For a particular function, such\nas \u03bb = hla=\u22121/2 , the normal ordered form of e\u00b1q(\u03bb) is ill-defined in the bosonic case, but it\nis not so in the superstring. Nevertheless, a homotopy operator can be found, which may\nimply that the corresponding identity-based solution in cubic superstring field theory,\ninvestigated in \u00a74, would be nontrivial although it has a pure gauge expression (4.21)\nl\nformally. In fact, the image of nontrivial part |\u03c6i of the QB -cohomology: eq(h\u22121/2 ) |\u03c6i is\nmapped to the states outside the Fock space by the homotopy operator \u00c2 in the sense\nl\nl\nthat all coefficients of \u03c7\u2032 \u2261 \u00c2eq(h\u22121/2 ) |\u03c6i vanish in the Fock space and eq(h\u22121/2 ) |\u03c6i = Q\u2032 \u03c7\u2032\nholds as far as we respect the relation {Q\u2032 , \u00c2} = 1. It is necessary to define space of states\nor string fields more rigorously in order to clarify this delicate issue.\nThe identity-based solution, which we have constructed, is a universal solution in the\ncubic superstring field theory. The solution might represent a vacuum where a D-brane\nvanishes because the cohomology of the BRST operator becomes empty. However, this\ninterpretation might be obscure because the original theory is on a BPS D-brane, which\nshould be stable. The situation may be similar to the Erler solution [4], at which there\nexists a homotopy operator and its energy reproduces a D-brane tension.\nTo confirm the non-triviality of the obtained solution for particular functions, such as\n\u03bb = hla=\u22121/2 , the evaluations of the vacuum energy or the gauge invariant overlap 3 are\ndesired. However, direct computations are difficult as in the case of bosonic SFT because\nAc is an identity-based solution. Namely, indefinite quantities will appear because the\nidentity state has vanishing width in terms of the sliver frame. To avoid this singularity,\nwe can map the solution of QB A + A \u2217 A = 0 to other solution, which is given by a linear\ncombination of states with finite width, as was elaborated in [21], for example. In principle,\nwe can evaluate the vacuum energy or the gauge invariant overlap for the mapped solution\nas a regularization. In the action of modified cubic superstring field theory, the inverse\npicture changing operators, Y and Y\u22122 , are inserted at the midpoint, which might cause\nanother problem. However, we find that the OPEs: jB (y)Y (z), c(y)Y (z), \u03b8(y)Y (z) (y \u2192\nz) are regular, where Y = Y (i) = c(i)\u03b4 \u2032 (\u03b3(i)) and Y\u22122 = Y (i)Y (\u2212i) in terms of the (\u03b2, \u03b3)\nsystem. Therefore, there are no apparent divergences caused by the collisions of Y, Y\u22122\nand the operators on the identity state in the solution Ac .\n\nAcknowledgments\nI. K. and T.

Firstly,\nwe note that the L(\u2261 {QB , b0 }) 6= 0 sector is QB -trivial also in the R sector. By restricting\nthe Fock space to Ker b0 \u2229 Ker \u03b20 and p+ 6= 0, the QB -cohomology was investigated in [27]\nand the result is\nQB \u03a8 = 0, b0 \u03a8 = 0, \u03b20 \u03a8 = 0 \u21d4 \u03a8 = |Pi\u2212 1 + QB \u03c7,\n2\n\n(B.20)\n\nwhere |Pi\u2212 1 indicates the states generated by the transverse operators, which (anti2\n)commute with QB , in the matter sector and c1 |0ibc \u2297 |P = \u22121/2i\u03b2\u03b3 in the ghost sector.\nLet us remove the b0 and \u03b20 gauge condition.
