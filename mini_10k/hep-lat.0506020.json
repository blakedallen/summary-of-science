While the compact formulation of QED3 appears to be more suitable for studying the mechanism of confinement, both compact [5] and\nnoncompact formulations arise in condensed matter systems. Our paper aims to elucidate some aspects of the\nrelationship between these two formulations of QED3 on\nthe lattice.\nPolyakov showed that compact QED3 without fermion\ndegrees of freedom is always confining [1]. Any pair of\ntest electric charge and anti-charge is confined by a linear potential, as an effect of proliferation of instantons,\nwhich are magnetic monopole solutions in three dimensions. The plasma of such monopoles is what is responsible for confinement of electrically charged particles. If\ncompact QED3 is coupled to matter fields it has been\nargued [6] that the interaction between monopoles could\nturn from 1/x to \u2212 ln (x) at large distances x, so that\nthe deconfined phase may become stable at low temperature. The issue of the existence of a confinementdeconfinement transition in QED3 at T = 0 is still controversial, as it has also been proposed that compact\nQED3 with massless fermions is always in the confined\nphase [7, 8]; also, in the limit of large flavor number, it\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: fiore@cs.infn.it\naddress: giudice@cs.infn.it\n\u2021 Electronic address: giuliano@cs.infn.it\n\u00a7 Electronic address: marmotti@cs.infn.it\n\u00b6 Electronic address: papa@cs.infn.it\n\u2217\u2217 Electronic address: pasquale.sodano@pg.infn.it\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nhas been argued that monopoles should not play any role\nin the confinement mechanism [9]. At finite temperature,\nparity invariant QED3 coupled with fermionic matter undergoes a Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition to a\ndeconfined phase [10].\nThe issue of charge confinement in 2 + 1 dimensional\ngauge models comes out to be relevant in the context\nof quantum phase transitions, as well. Indeed, recently\nit has been proposed that phenomena similar to deconfinement in high energy physics might appear in planar\ncorrelated systems, driven to a quantum (that is, zerotemperature) phase transition between an antiferromagnetically ordered (Ne\u00e9l) phase, and a phase with no order\nby continuous symmetry breaking [2, 3]. The most suitable candidate for a theoretical description of the system\nnear the quantum critical point is a planar gauge theory, either with Fermionic matter [2], or with Bosonic\nmatter [3].\nAt finite T noncompact QED3 comes about to be relevant in the analysis of the pseudo gap phase [11] of\ncuprates. This phase arises from the fact that, upon\ndoping the cuprate, a gap opens at some temperature T \u22c6\nwhich is quite larger than the critical temperature TC\nfor the onset of superconductivity. Both temperatures\nT \u22c6 and TC are doping dependent quantities and the gap\nis strongly dependent upon the direction in momentum\nspace, since it exhibits d-wave symmetry [12].\nIn Fig. 1 we report the phase diagram of high-Tc\ncuprates. For small-x phase is characterized [13] by an\ninsulating antiferromagnet (AF); by increasing x, this\nphase evolves into a spin density wave (SDW), that is\na weak antiferromagnet. The pseudo gap phase is located between this phase and the d-wave superconducting (dSC) one.\nThe effective theory of the pseudo gap phase [11] turns\nout to be QED3 [4, 14, 15], with spatial anisotropies in\nthe covariant derivatives, that is with different values for\nthe Fermi and the Gap velocities [13], and with Fermionic\n\n\f2\nmatter given by spin-1/2 chargeless excitations of the\nsuperconducting state (spinons). These excitations are\nminimally coupled to a massless gauge field, which arises\nfrom the fluctuating topological defects in the superconducting phase. The SDW order parameter is identified\nwith the order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking\n(CSB) in the gauge theory, that is, h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i [15]. There can\nbe two possibilities; if h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i is different from zero, then\nthe d-wave superconducting phase is connected to the\nspin density wave one (see Fig. 1 case b); otherwise the\ntwo phases are separated at T = 0 by the pseudo gap\nphase (see Fig. 1 case a).\nConfinement and chiral symmetry breaking go essentially together as strong coupling phenomena in gauge\ntheories; while confinement is an observed property of\nthe strong interactions and it is an unproven, but widely\nbelieved feature of non-abelian gauge theories in four\nspace-time dimensions, chiral symmetry is only an approximate symmetry of particle physics, since the up and\ndown quarks are light but not massless. Central to our\nunderstanding of CSB is the existence of a critical coupling: when fermions have a sufficiently strong attractive interaction there is a pairing instability and the ensuing condensate breaks some of the flavor symmetries,\ngenerate quark masses, and represents chiral symmetry\nin the Nambu-Goldstone mode [16, 17]. The issue of\na critical coupling has been widely investigated in 2+1\ndimensional gauge theories [18, 19, 20]. Typically, the\ndimensionless expansion parameter is 1/Nf . Using the\nSchwinger-Dyson equations [18] or a current algebra approach [21] for QED3 and QCD3 one finds that there is\na critical number of flavors, Nf,c , such that only for Nf\nlesser than Nf,c chiral symmetry is broken; for Nf bigger\nthan Nf,c chirality is unbroken and quarks remain massless. For QED3 this result has been the subject of some\ndebate [18, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]; there are, however, numerical simulations [27, 28, 29] of QED3 , which find an\nNf,c remarkably close to the results reported in Ref. [18].\nEven if far from the scaling regime, strong coupling\ngauge theories on the lattice provide interesting clues on\nthe issue of CSB. In fact, one can show that, in the strong\ncoupling limit, a Hamiltonian with Nc colors of fermions\nand Nf /2 lattice flavors of staggered fermions is effectively a U (Nf /2) quantum antiferromagnet with representations determined by Nc and Nf [30]. CSB is then\nassociated [30] either to the formation of a U (1) commensurate charge density wave or of a SU (Nf /2) spin density wave, i.e. to the formation of Ne\u00e9l order. Quantum\nantiferromagnets with the representations considered in\nRef. [30] have been analyzed in Ref. [31] where it was\nfound that, for small enough Nf , the ground state is ordered. Also, when Nf is increased there is a phase transition, for Nf \u223c Nc , to a disordered state. In this picture,\nthe large Nc limit is the classical limit where Ne\u00e9l order\nis favored and the small Nc and large Nf limit are where\nfluctuations are large and disordered ground states are\nfavored.\nWe shall not try to ascertain in this paper the critical\n\n(a)\nT\n\nCSB\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\ndSC\n\n(b)\nCSB\n\nT*\n\ndSC\n\nQED3\nAF/\nSDW\n(CSB)\n\nTc\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\ndSC\nx\n\nFIG. 1: Phase diagram in the (x, T ) plane [14]; here x represents the doping and T the temperature.\n\nnumber of flavours Nf,c . Here, we shall analyze the relationship between monopole density and fermion mass\nand compare the results obtained for the compact and\nnoncompact lattice formulation of this gauge model. In\nparticular, we revisit the analysis of Fiebig and Woloshyn\nof Refs. [32, 33], where the dynamic equivalence between\nthe two formulations of (isotropic) QED3 is claimed to\nbe valid in the finite lattice regime. In this paper we shall\nextend the comparison to the continuum limit, following\nthe same approach as in Refs. [32, 33]: namely we shall\nanalyze the behavior of the chiral condensate and of the\nmonopole density as the continuum limit is reached.\nIn Section II we describe the model and its properties\nboth in the continuum and on the lattice. Moreover, the\nmethod for detecting monopoles on the lattice is illustrated.\nIn Section III a description of both compact and noncompact formulations of QED3 is given.\nIn Section IV we present our numerical result for the\nchiral condensate and the monopole density in the region\nin which the continuum limit is reached. Then, we compare our results with those of Fiebig and Woloshyn [32,\n33].\nSection V is devoted to conclusions.\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL AND ITS PROPERTIES\n\nThe continuum Lagrangian density describing QED3\nis given in Minkowski metric [34] by\n1 2\nL = \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd\n+ \u03c8 i iD\u03bc \u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8i \u2212 m0 \u03c8 i \u03c8i ,\n4\n\n(1)\n\nwhere D\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u2212 ieA\u03bc , F\u03bc\u03bd is the field strength and\nthe fermions \u03c8i (i = 1, . . . , Nf ) are 4-component spinors.\nSince QED3 is a super-renormalizable theory, dim[e] =\n\n\f3\n+1/2, the coupling does not display any energy dependence.

We apply\nthis definition for both the compact and the noncompact\nformulations of the theory, although some caution should\nbe used in this respect. Indeed, monopoles are classical\nsolutions of the theory with finite action only for compact\nQED3 , where they are known to play a relevant role. In\nthe noncompact formulation of QED3 they are not classical solutions, but they could give a contribution to the\nFeynman path integral owing to the periodic structure of\nthe fermionic sector [38].\n\nm\u03c8\u03c8 = m\u03c81\u2020 \u03c33 \u03c81 \u2212 m\u03c82\u2020 \u03c33 \u03c82 .\nSince in three dimensions the parity transformation reads\n\u03c81 (x0 , x1 , x2 ) \u2192 \u03c31 \u03c82 (x0 , \u2212x1 , x2 ) ,\n\u03c82 (x0 , x1 , x2 ) \u2192 \u03c31 \u03c81 (x0 , \u2212x1 , x2 ) ,\n\n(5)\n\nthen m\u03c8\u03c8 is parity conserving.\nThe lattice Euclidean action [28, 35] using staggered\nfermion fields \u03c7, \u03c7, is given by\nN X\nX\n\nS = SG +\n\n\u03c7i (n)Mn,m \u03c7i (m) ,\n\n(6)\n\ni=1 n,m\n\nwhere SG is the gauge field action and the fermion matrix\nis given by\nMn,m [U ]\n=\n\nP\n\n\u03b7\u03bd (n)\n\u03bd=1,2,3\n2\n\n\b\n\n[U\u03bd (n)]\u03b4m,n+\u03bd\u0302 \u2212\n\n(7)\n[U\u03bd\u2020 (m)]\u03b4m,n\u2212\u03bd\u0302\n\n.\n\nThe action (6) allows to simulate N = 1, 2 flavours of\nstaggered fermions corresponding to Nf = 2, 4 flavours\nof 4-component fermions \u03c8 [36].

Such an observable can be\ntaken to be \u03b2 2 h\u03c7\u03c7i, which is expected to become constant in the continuum (\u03b2 \u2192 \u221e) limit [27, 39]. Numerical simulations show two regimes: for \u03b2 larger than a\ncertain value, the theory is in the continuum limit (flat\ndependence of a dimensionless observable from \u03b2), otherwise the system is in a phase with finite lattice spacing.\nIn the former regime, the theory describes continuum\nphysics, in the latter one it is appropriate to describe a\nlattice condensed-matter-like system.\nThere are a couple of papers by Fiebig and Woloshyn\nin which the two formulations are compared in the finite\nlattice regime [32, 33]. In these papers the \u03b2-dependence\nof the chiral condensate and of the monopole density for\nlattice QED3 with Nf = 0 and Nf = 2 are analyzed for\nboth compact and noncompact formulations in the finite\nlattice regime.\nIt is shown there that, when h\u03c7\u03c7i is plotted versus the\nmonopole density \u03c1m , data points for both theories fall\non the same curve to a good approximation (see Fig. 2).\nThis led the authors of Refs. [32, 33] to the conclusion\nthat the physics of the chiral symmetry breaking is the\nsame in the two theories.\nOur program is to study if the conclusion reached by\nFiebig and Woloshyn can be extended to the continuum\nlimit, by looking at the same observables they considered:\nnamely the chiral condensate and the monopole density.\n\n\f4\nnoncompact\ncompact\n\n0.5\n\n3\n\n<\u03c7\u03c7>\n\n0.4\n0.3\n\nlattice 8\nNf=2\n5\nstat. 10\n\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.00\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n\u03c1m\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\n0.25\n\nFIG. 3: As in Fig. 2, according to our results.\n\nFIG. 2: Correlation between h\u03c7\u03c7i and \u03c1m for the compact\n(circles) and the noncompact (boxes) theories for Nf = 2 and\n83 lattice according to Ref.

The continuum limit is approached by merely\nsending \u03b2 = 1/(e2 a) to infinity. In this limit all physical\nquantities can be expressed in units of the scale set by\nthe coupling e. Therefore, it is natural to work in terms\nof dimensionless variables such as \u03b2m, L/\u03b2 or \u03b2 2 h\u03c7\u03c7i,\nwhich depend on e (L is the lattice size).\nThe signature that the continuum limit is approached\nis that data taken at different \u03b2 should overlap on a single\ncurve when plotted in dimensionless units [28].\nIn practice, numerical results will not describe the correct physics of the system even in the continuum limit\nbecause of finite volume effects which are particularly\nsignificant in our case, due to the presence of a massless\nparticle, the photon. In principle one should get rid of\nthese effects by taking L/\u03b2 \u2192 \u221e. In practice, this ratio\nis taken to be large, but finite. In Ref. [40] the authors\nconclude that in order to find chiral symmetry breaking\nfor Nf = 2 at least a ratio L/\u03b2 \u2248 5 \u00d7 103 is required. In\nour simulations the largest value for the L/\u03b2 ratio has\nbeen 20.\nOur Monte Carlo simulation code was based on the\nhybrid updating algorithm, with a microcanonical time\n\n\u03b2 <\u03c7\u03c7>\n\nIV.\n\nstep set to dt = 0.02. We simulated one flavour of\nstaggered fermions corresponding to two flavours of 4component fermions. Most simulations were performed\non a 123 lattice, for bare quark mass ranging in the interval am = 0.01 \u00f7 0.05. We made refreshments of the\ngauge (pseudofermion) fields every 7 (13) steps of the\nmolecular dynamics. In order to reduce autocorrelation\neffects, \"measurements\" were taken every 50 steps. Data\nwere analyzed by the jackknife method combined with\nbinning.\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n0.00\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\u03b2m\n\n0.08\n\n0.10\n\n0.12\n\nFIG. 4: \u03b2 2 h\u03c7\u03c7i versus \u03b2m in the compact formulation.\n\nAs a first step, we have reproduced the results by\nFiebig and Woloshyn which are shown in Fig. 2. We find\nthat also in our case data points from the two formulations nicely overlap (see Fig. 3). It should be noticed that\ndata of Fig. 2 were obtained using a linear fit with two\nmasses (am=0.025, 0.05) whilst those of Fig. 3 have been\nobtained by a quadratic fit with four masses (am=0.02,\n0.03, 0.04, 0.05), nevertheless the conclusion is the same\nin both cases. We have verified that if we perform a linear\nfit on the subset of our data with masses am=0.02 and\n0.05 and on the subset with masses am=0.03 and 0.05,\nour results nicely compare with those plotted in Fig. 2.\n\n\f5\nThen, in Fig. 4 we plot data for \u03b2 2 h\u03c7\u03c7i obtained\nin the compact formulation versus \u03b2m. We restrict\nour attention to the subset of \u03b2 values for which data\npoints fall approximately on the same curve, which in\nthe present case means \u03b2 = 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, corresponding to\nL/\u03b2 = 6.31, 6.00, 5.71. A linear fit of these data points\ngives \u03c72 /d.o.f. \u2243 8.4 and the extrapolated value for\n\u03b2m \u2192 0 turns out to be \u03b2 2 h\u03c7\u03c7i = (1.54 \u00b1 0.25) \u00d7 10\u22123 .\nRestricting the sample to the data at \u03b2 = 2.1, the\n\u03c72 /d.o.f. lowers to \u2243 1.3 and the extrapolated value\nbecomes \u03b2 2 h\u03c7\u03c7i = (0.94 \u00b1 0.28) \u00d7 10\u22123 , thus showing\nthat there is a strong instability in the determination\nof the chiral limit. If instead a quadratic fit is used\nfor the points obtained with \u03b2 = 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, we get\n\u03b2 2 h\u03c7\u03c7i = (0.91 \u00b1 0.45) \u00d7 10\u22123 with \u03c72 /d.o.f. \u2243 8.7.\nOwing to the large uncertainty, this determination turns\nout to be compatible with both the previous ones.\n0.08\n\n0.04\n\n\u03b2=0.6\n\u03b2=0.7\n\u03b2=0.75\n\u03b2=0.8\n\u03b2=0.9\n\n2\n\n\u03b2 <\u03c7\u03c7>\n\n3\n\n0.07 lattice 12\nNf=2\n4\n5\n0.06 stat. 7.4x10 -1.0x10\nnoncompact form.\n0.05\n\n0.03\n0.02\n0.01\n0.00\n0.00\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n\u03b2m\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\nIt is worth mentioning that our results in the noncompact formulation are consistent with known results:\nindeed, if we carry out a linear fit of the data for\n\u03b2 = 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and am=0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05 and extrapolate, we get \u03b2 2 h\u03c7\u03c7i = (1.30 \u00b1 0.07) \u00d7 10\u22123 with\nan admittedly large \u03c72 /d.o.f. \u2243 20, but very much in\nagreement with the value \u03b2 2 h\u03c7\u03c7i = (1.40 \u00b1 0.16) \u00d7 10\u22123\nobtained in Ref. [35].\nWe stress again that our results are plagued by strong\nfinite volume effects, therefore our conclusions on the extrapolated values of \u03b2 2 h\u03c7\u03c7i are significant only in the\ncompact versus noncompact comparison we are interested in. We do not even try to draw any conclusion\nfrom our data on the critical number of the flavours. As\na matter of fact a recent paper [28] shows that, if effects\nare carefully monitored and large lattices, up to 503 , are\nused, it is possible to establish that \u03b2 2 h\u03c7\u03c7i \u2264 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 .\nFor the comparison between compact and noncompact\nQED3 it is pertinent to carry out the numerical analysis\nwith an (approximately) constant value of the ratio L/\u03b2.\nThis condition is indeed verified even if we performed\nsimulations on lattices with fixed (L = 12) size, since the\nrange of allowed values for \u03b2 corresponding to the continuum limit is narrow (\u03b2 = 1.8 \u00f7 2.2 in the compact case,\n\u03b2 = 0.6 \u00f7 0.9 in the noncompact case). Finite volume\neffects play a \"second order\" role in our work, since they\nprobably only affect the extension of the continuum limit\nwindow of \u03b2 values.\n3.0e-03\n\n0.05\n\n2.5e-03\n2.0e-03\n<\u03c7\u03c7>\n\nFIG. 5: \u03b2 2 h\u03c7\u03c7i versus \u03b2m in the noncompact formulation.\n\nIn Fig. 5 we plot data for \u03b2 2 h\u03c7\u03c7i obtained in the noncompact formulation versus \u03b2m. Following the same\nstrategy outlined before, we restrict our analysis to the\ndata obtained with \u03b2 = 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, which correspond\nto L/\u03b2 = 17.14, 16, 15.\nIf we consider a linear fit of these data and extrapolate\nto \u03b2m \u2192 0, we get \u03b2 2 h\u03c7\u03c7i = (0.45 \u00b1 0.03) \u00d7 10\u22123 with\n\u03c72 /d.o.f. \u2243 17. Performing the fit only on the data\nobtained with \u03b2 = 0.8, for which a linear fit gives the\nbest \u03c72 /d.o.f. value \u2243 16, we obtain the extrapolated\nvalue \u03b2 2 h\u03c7\u03c7i = (0.66 \u00b1 0.07) \u00d7 10\u22123 . Therefore, also\nin the noncompact formulation the chiral extrapolation\nresulting from a linear fit is largely unstable. A quadratic\nfit in this case gives instead a negative value for \u03b2 2 h\u03c7\u03c7i.\nThe comparison of the extrapolated value for \u03b2 2 h\u03c7\u03c7i\nin the two formulations is difficult owing to the instabilities of the fits and to the low reliability of the linear fits,\nas suggested by the large values of the \u03c72 /d.o.f. Taking an optimistic point of view, one could say that the\nextrapolated \u03b2 2 h\u03c7\u03c7i for \u03b2 = 2.1 in the compact formulation is compatible with the extrapolated value obtained\nin the noncompact formulation for \u03b2 = 0.8.\n\ncompact\nnoncompact\nlattice 12\nNf=2\n\n3\n\n1.5e-03\n1.0e-03\n5.0e-04\n0.0e+00\n0.000\n\n0.001\n\n0.002\n\n\u03c1m\n\n0.003\n\n0.004\n\n0.005\n\nFIG. 6: h\u03c7\u03c7i versus \u03c1m in both the compact and the noncompact formulations on a 123 lattice.\n\nIn Fig. 6 we plot h\u03c7\u03c7i versus the monopole density\n\u03c1m . Differently from Figs. 2-3, it is not evident with the\npresent results that the two formulations are equivalent\nalso in the continuum limit, although such an equivalence\ncannot yet be excluded.\nIn Fig. 7 we plot again h\u03c7\u03c7i versus the monopole density \u03c1m , but now on a 323 lattice. In this case the chiral\ncondensate is extrapolated to zero mass by a quadratic\nfit. In spite of the negative value taken by h\u03c7\u03c7i for large\n\u03b2, in this case data for both formulations seem to fall on\n\n\f6\nthat this same mechanism holds also in the chiral\nlimit.

Our results show that this\nis not the case, this suggesting that the continuum limit\nhas not been reached for the monopole density.\nSimulations on the 323 lattice give practically the same\nresults for \u03b2 3 \u03c1m , indicating that this observable, unlike\n\u03b2 2 h\u03c7\u03c7i, is volume independent.\nIt is important to observe, however, that the monopole\ndensity is independent of the fermion mass. Since the\nmechanism of confinement in the theory with infinitely\nmassive fermions, i.e. in the pure gauge theory, is\nbased on monopoles and since the monopole density is\nnot affected by the fermion mass, we may conjecture\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have compared the compact and the\nnoncompact formulations of QED3 by looking at the behavior of the chiral condensate and the monopole density.\nNumerical results for \u03b2 2 h\u03c7\u03c7i are compatible with those\nobtained by other groups, although it is still questionable\nif the continuum limit has been reached and if the chiral\nlimit is stable. The biggest difficulty for this observable\nis that the chiral extrapolation is rough when a linear fit\nis performed, but gives a negative value when instead a\nquadratic fit is considered. Massive calculations on larger\nlattices are needed to further reduce the finite volume\neffects and to stabilize the chiral limit.\nAs far as monopoles are concerned, they appear in\nsmaller and smaller numbers for large \u03b2, this making the\ndetermination of the continuum limit for \u03b2 3 \u03c1m rather\nproblematic. Our results show, however, a very weak\nvolume dependence.\nWe have analyzed also the relationship between the\nmonopole density and the fermion mass, both in compact\nand noncompact QED3 . The weak dependence observed\nleads us to conclude that the Polyakov mechanism for\nconfinement holds not only in the pure gauge theory, but\nalso in presence of massless fermions.\nFinally, we note that, although the chiral condensate\nand monopole density approach the continuum limit in\ntwo different ranges of \u03b2, the analysis \u00e0 la \"Fiebig and\nWoloshin\" does not allow to exclude the equivalence\nof the compact and noncompact lattice formulations of\nQED3 .\n\n\f7\n\n[1] A.M.
