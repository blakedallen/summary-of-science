Introduction\nIn [Tu10] I introduced the notion of a non-homogeneous symplectic form on a\nsupermanifold and I constructed a possible prequantization of such a symplectic\nsupermanifold. The question remained whether non-homogenous symplectic forms\nare interesting to study and whether the proposed prequantization is the correct\none to use. In this paper I will show by an explicit example that non-homogeneous\nsymplectic forms play a role in representation theory. The example I will study is\na Heisenberg-like group, meaning that we have two graded vector spaces E and C\nand an even graded skew-symmetric bilinear form \u03a9 : E \u00d7 E \u2192 C and that we\nlook at the group G which is as a manifold the even part of E \u00d7 C: G = (E \u00d7 C)0\nequipped with the group structure\n(a, b) * (\u00e2, b\u0302) = (a + \u00e2, b + b\u0302 + 12 \u03b9(a, \u00e2)\u03a9) .\nOn this group I look at the (left-) regular representation consisting of squareintegrable functions on G with the group action\n(\u03a6g f )(\u011d) = f (g \u22121 * \u011d) .\nUsing ordinary Fourier direct integrals and Berezin-Fourier direct integrals, it is\nfairly easy to decompose this regular representation into invariant subspaces. Depending upon the Fourier parameters, some of these subspaces can be decomposed\nfurther in direct (Berezin-) Fourier integrals and others can be seen to be a direct\nsum of two invariant subspaces. A summary of the obtained decomposition is given\nat the end of \u00a73.\nSince we use direct integrals, these subspaces are not really subspaces in the strict\nsense of the word: the functions in question are no longer square-integrable over the\nTypeset by AMS-TEX\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nG.M. TUYNMAN\n\ngroup. But this is a standard technical detail. More important is the fact that these\nsubspaces for an odd Berezin-Fourier parameter are not graded subspaces in any\nreasonable sense. We thus provide in \u00a74 a framework for dealing with this kind of\nsubspaces by defining what we mean by an odd family decomposition of a graded\nvector space and what it should mean when we say that such a decomposition\nis irreducible. In the next section we apply these definitions to show that the\ndecomposition of our regular representation obtained in \u00a73 is irreducible. We thus\nhave completely decomposed the regular representation into irreducible parts.\nThe next task is to see how the irreducible representations obtained in the decomposition of the regular representation correspond to the representations obtained\nby quantizing coadjoint orbits. It turns out that there are four types of coadjoint\norbits: 0-dimensional ones, 2|2-dimensional ones with an even symplectic form,\n2|2-dimensional ones with an odd symplectic form and 3|3-dimensional ones with\na non-homogenous symplectic form. In order to compute the associated representations, it turns out that we have to adjust the prequantization procedure given in\n[Tu10] slightly by introducing an odd parameter for the odd part of the symplectic\nform. This parameter is the odd counterpart of the parameter ~ that is used for\nthe even part. The difference is that the actual value of ~ can be taken to be 1 by\nadjusting the physical units, whereas we cannot \"rescale\" the odd parameter.\nIn the ungraded case it is (at least morally) true that the representation is independent of the choice of the invariant polarization. In the graded case this is true as\nlong as the graded dimension of the polarization does not change; (invariant) polarizations with different graded dimensions will give rise to different representations.\nFor the orbits of dimension 0 and those of dimension 2|2 with an even symplectic\nform there is only one graded dimension possible for an invariant polarization, but\nfor 2|2-dimensional orbits with an odd symplectic form there are three different\npossibilities and for 3|3-dimensional orbits there are two possibilities. Each of these\npossibilities gives rise to a representation of our supergroup.\nWhen we compare these representations with those obtained in the decomposition of the regular representation, we find the following result: all representations\nassociated to 0-dimensional orbits appear; some but not all representations associated to 2|2-dimensional orbits with an even symplectic form appear; some but not\nall representations associated to 2|2-dimensional orbits with an odd symplectic form\nand a 3|3-dimensional polarization appear; and finally, some but not all representations associated to 3|3-dimensional orbits (with a non-homogeneous symplectic\nform) with a 3|2-dimensional polarization appear. Representations associated to\norbits and polarizations of a different graded dimension do not appear in the regular representation. We thus see that representations associated to orbits with a\nnon-homogeneous symplectic form intervene in the regular representation, showing\nthat this kind of symplectic supermanifold is an interesting object to study.\nHowever, several problems still have to be solved. In the first place the question\nhow to interpret the odd parameter introduced in the prequantization for the odd\npart of the symplectic form. And then how to make the correspondence between\nthe irreducible representations appearing in the regular representation and those\nobtained by geometric quantization correctly. Because even though there is an\nobvious correspondence, there remains a problem how to identify real parameters\nwith odd parameters (see the end of this paper). And then a rather long list of\ntechnical problems have to be solved, among others how to define densities for\nthe quantization of symplectic supermanifolds with a non-homogeneous form (said\n\n\fGEOMETRIC QUANTIZATION OF SUPERORBITS: A CASE STUDY\n\n3\n\ndifferently, how to define in an intrinsic way the scalar product on the function\nspaces that appear in quantization) and how to define in a natural way the notion\nof equivalence between odd families of representations.\n2. Preliminaries\nI will work with the geometric H \u221e version of DeWitt supermanifolds, which is\nequivalent to the theory of graded manifolds of Leites and Kostant (see [DW], [Ko],\n[Le], [Ro], [Tu04]). Any reader using a (slightly) different version of supermanifolds\nshould be able to translate the results to her/his version of supermanifolds.\n\u2022 The basic graded ring will be denoted as A and we will think of it as the\nexterior algebra A = \u039bV of an infinite dimensional real vector space V .\n\u2022 Any element x in a graded space splits into an even and an odd part x = x0 +x1 .\n\u2022 All (graded) objects over the basic ring A have an underlying real structure,\ncalled their body, in which all nilpotent elements in A are ignored/killed. This\nforgetful map is called the body map, denoted by the symbol B. For the ring A\nthis is the map/projection B : A = \u039bV \u2192 \u039b0 V = R.\n\u2022 If \u03c9 is a k-form and X a vector field, we denote the contraction of the vector\nfield X with the k-form \u03c9 by \u03b9(X)\u03c9, which yields a k \u2212 1-form. If X1 , . . . , Xl are\nl \u2264 k vector fields, we denote the repeated contraction of \u03c9 by \u03b9(X1 , * * * , Xl )\u03c9.\nMore precisely:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03b9(X1 , * * * , Xl )\u03c9 = \u03b9(X1 ) \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 \u03b9(Xl ) \u03c9 .\n\nIn the special case l = k this definition differs by a factor (\u22121)k(k\u22121)/2 from the\nusual definition of the evaluation of a k-form on k vector fields. This difference is\ndue to the fact that in ordinary differential geometry repeated contraction with\nk vector fields corresponds to the direct evaluation in the reverse order. And\nindeed, (\u22121)k(k\u22121)/2 is the signature of the permutation changing 1, 2, . . . , k in\nk, k \u2212 1, . . . , 2, 1. However, in graded differential geometry this permutation not\nonly introduces this signature, but also signs depending upon the parities of the\nvector fields. These additional signs are avoided by our definition.\n\u2022 The evaluation of a left linear map \u03bc on a vector v is denoted as hv |\u03bci. For\nthe contraction of a multi-linear form with a vector we will use the same notation\nas for the contraction of a differential form with a vector field. In particular, we\ndenote the evaluation of a left bilinear map \u03a9 on a vector v by \u03b9(v)\u03a9, which yields\na left linear map w 7\u2192 hw |\u03b9(v)\u03a9i \u2261 \u03b9(w, v)\u03a9.\n\u2022 If E is an A-vector space, E \u2217 will denote the left dual of E, i.e., the space of\nall left linear maps from E to A.\n\u2022 If G is an A-Lie group, then its A-Lie algebra g is g = Te G, whose Lie algebra structure is given by the commutator of left-invariant vector fields (who are\ndetermined by their value at e \u2208 G).\n\u2022 If \u03a6 : G \u00d7 M \u2192 M denotes the (left) action of an A-Lie group G on an Amanifold M , then for all v \u2208 g = Te G the associated fundamental vector field v M\non M is defined as v M |m = \u2212T(e,m) \u03a6(v, 0). The minus sign is conventional and\nensures that the map from g to vector fields on M is a homomorphism of A-Lie\nalgebras.\nSimilarly, if \u03a6 : M \u00d7 G \u2192 M is a right action of G on M , then the fundamental\nvector field v M associated to v \u2208 g is defined as v M |m = T(m,e) \u03a6(0, v). And again\n\n\f4\n\nG.M. TUYNMAN\n\nthe map from g to vector fields on M is a morphism of A-Lie algebras. In the\nspecial case when M = G with the natural right action on itself, the fundamental\nvector fields are exactly the left-invariant vector fields on G.\n3.

This is essentially a Fourier mode with respect to the coordinates a2 , a3 , \u03b14 , b, \u03b2. More precisely,\nthe functions t(l0 ,l2 ,l3 ,\u03bb0 ,\u03bb4 ) are the Fourier transform with respect to the coordinates a2 , a3 , \u03b14 , c, \u03b3 of a function f with\nc = b + 12 a1 a2\n\n,\n\n\u03b3 = \u03b2 + 21 a1 \u03b14 \u2212 12 a3 \u03b15\n\n\fGEOMETRIC QUANTIZATION OF SUPERORBITS: A CASE STUDY\n\n5\n\ngiven explicitly by\n1\n\n5\n\n\u22123\n\n6\n\nt(l0 ,l2 ,l3 ,\u03bb0 ,\u03bb4 ) (a , \u03b1 , \u03b1 ) = (2\u03c0)\n2\n\n*\n\nZ\n\n\u0001\nf ai , \u03b1j , c \u2212 12 a1 a2 , \u03b3 \u2212 21 a1 \u03b14 + 12 a3 \u03b15 *\n\n3\n\n4\n\ne\u2212il2 a * e\u2212il3 a * e\u2212i\u03bb4 \u03b1 * e\u2212il0 c * e\u2212i\u03bb0 \u03b3 dc d\u03b3 da2 da3 d\u03b14 ,\n\nwhere we use Berezin integration for the odd variables \u03b14 and \u03b3 (see also [GS,\u00a77.1]).\nWith our choice of the normalization constant, the inverse operation is given by\nZ\n2\n3\n4\nf (ai , \u03b1j , b, \u03b2) = t(l0 ,l2 ,l3 ,\u03bb0 ,\u03bb4 ) (a1 , \u03b15 , \u03b16 ) * eil2 a * eil3 a * ei\u03bb4 \u03b1\n1\n\n* eil0 (b+ 2 a\n\n1\n\nxa2 )\n\n1\n\n* ei\u03bb0 (\u03b2+ 2 a\n\n1\n\n\u03b14 \u2212 21 a3 \u03b15 )\n\ndl0 dl2 dl3 d\u03bb0 d\u03bb4 .\n\nThis shows that an arbitrary function on G can be written as a direct integral\nof functions of the form (3.2), or more precisely that we have a direct integral\ndecomposition of V as\nZ\n(3.3)\nV = V(l0 ,l2 ,l3 ,\u03bb0 ,\u03bb4 ) dl0 dl2 dl3 d\u03bb0 d\u03bb4 .\nThe action of \u03a6\u011d on a function f of the form (3.2) is given by the formula\n(\u03a6\u011d f )(g) = t(l0 ,l2 ,l3 ,\u03bb0 ,\u03bb4 ) (a1 \u2212 \u00e21 , \u03b15 \u2212 \u03b1\u03025 , \u03b16 \u2212 \u03b1\u03026 )*\ne\u2212il0 (\u00e2\n2\n\na \u2212 12 \u03b1\u03025 \u03b15 + 21 \u03b1\u03026 \u03b16 )\n\n2 1\n\n3\n\n4\n\ne\u2212il2 \u00e2 * e\u2212il3 \u00e2 * e\u2212i\u03bb4 \u03b1\u0302 * e\n2\n\n4 1\n\n* e\u2212i\u03bb0 (\u03b1\u0302\n\n\u2212il0 (b\u0302\u2212 21 \u00e21 \u00e22 )\n\n3\n\n4\n\neil2 a * eil3 a * ei\u03bb4 \u03b1 * e\n\n*e\n\na \u2212\u00e23 \u03b15 )\n\n*\n\n\u2212i\u03bb0 (\u03b2\u0302\u2212 12 \u00e21 \u03b1\u03024 + 21 \u00e23 \u03b1\u03025 )\n\nil0 (b+ 12 a1 a2 )\n\n*e\n\n*\n\ni\u03bb0 (\u03b2+ 21 a1 \u03b14 \u2212 12 a3 \u03b15 )\n\n,\n\nwhich shows that the spaces V(l0 ,l2 ,l3 ,\u03bb0 ,\u03bb4 ) are invariant under the action of G.\nThe direct integral decomposition (3.3) thus is a decomposition into invariant \"subspaces.\"\nIn order to simplify notation, we will identify a function f \u2208 V(l0 ,l2 ,l3 ,\u03bb0 ,\u03bb4 ) , i.e.\nof the form (3.2), with the function t(l0 ,l2 ,l3 ,\u03bb0 ,\u03bb4 ) of the three variables a1 , \u03b15 , \u03b16 .\nIn terms of such a function t of these three variables, the action \u03a8\u011d of \u011d \u2208 G is\ngiven by\n(3.4) (\u03a8\u011d t)(a1 , \u03b15 , \u03b16 ) = t(a1 \u2212 \u00e21 , \u03b15 \u2212 \u03b1\u03025 , \u03b16 \u2212 \u03b1\u03026 )*\ne\u2212il0 (\u00e2\n2\n\n2 1\n\na \u2212 12 \u03b1\u03025 \u03b15 + 21 \u03b1\u03026 \u03b16 )\n3\n\n4\n\ne\u2212il2 \u00e2 * e\u2212il3 \u00e2 * e\u2212i\u03bb4 \u03b1\u0302 * e\n\n4 1\n\n* e\u2212i\u03bb0 (\u03b1\u0302\n\na \u2212\u00e23 \u03b15 )\n\n\u2212il0 (b\u0302\u2212 21 \u00e21 \u00e22 )\n\n*\n1\n\n* e\u2212i\u03bb0 (\u03b2\u0302\u2212 2 \u00e2\n\n1\n\n\u03b1\u03024 + 21 \u00e23 \u03b1\u03025 )\n\n.\n\n3.5 Proposition.

Invariant odd families of subspaces\nThroughout this section, V will denote a graded vector space, G a graded Lie\ngroup and \u03a6 a representation of G on V . This means that \u03a6 is a smooth homomorphism from G to Aut(V ), the group of automorphisms of V . As is customary,\nwe will note the (even, bijective) linear map \u03a6(g) (for g \u2208 G) often as \u03a6g . The\npurpose of this section is to extend the notion of an irreducible subspace and/or\nirreducible decomposition to incorporate in a convenient way subspaces that are indexed by an odd parameter. Most of the discussion will concentrate on motivations\nfor the definitions [4.13] and [4.25] and we will finish this section with two results\nconcerning irreducibility that will be needed afterwards. Our arguments are based\n\n\f8\n\nG.M. TUYNMAN\n\nupon the notion of a graded vector space V and smooth linear maps as defined in\n[Tu04], meaning in particular that we identify the body BV as a part of V , that a\nbasis always consists of elements of BV , that a graded subspace always admits a\nbasis in BV (we thus make a distinction between (algebraic, linear) subspaces and\ngraded subspaces) and that a smooth linear map always maps BV into the body of\nthe target space. In this way there is a complete correspondence between graded\nvector spaces and smooth linear maps on the one hand and Z/2Z-graded vector\nspaces over R with (ordinary) linear maps on the other (just tensor with A). The\nonly difference being that in the latter case the distinction between left-linear and\nright-linear disappears.\nIf one starts to think about a family W\u03bb \u2282 V of subspaces indexed by an odd\nparameter \u03bb \u2208 A1 , one soon arrives at the following description:\nW\u03bb = {w + \u03bbI(w) | w \u2208 W }\nfor some subspace W \u2282 V and a linear map I : W \u2192 V . Even though it is not\nthe most general possibility, it also seems reasonable to require that W is a graded\nsubspace and that I is a smooth odd (right-)linear map. This gives us the following\ndefinition.\nDefinition. An odd family of subspaces (of V ) is a couple (W, I) where W \u2282 V is\na graded subspace and I : W \u2192 V a smooth odd right-linear map.\nRemarks. Right-linearity of the map I implies that we have I(v * \u03bb) = I(v) * \u03bb for\nall v \u2208 V and all \u03bb \u2208 A. However, the fact that I is odd implies that we don't have\nthe equality I(\u03bb * v) = \u03bb * I(v) for all v and \u03bb. What we do have is the equality\nI(\u03bb * v) = (\u22121)\u03b1 \u03bb * I(v) for all \u03bb \u2208 A\u03b1 , which means in particular that we obtain a\nminus sign if \u03bb is odd.\n\u2022 In general the subspaces W\u03bb will not be graded subspaces when \u03bb 6= 0. The\neasiest example is the graded vector space V with one even generator e and one\nodd generator f , the graded subspace W generated by e and the smooth odd rightlinear map I : W \u2192 V defined by I(e) = f . Then W\u03bb consists of the elements\n\u03b1 * (e + \u03bbf ), which does not allow a basis of the form xe + yf with x, y \u2208 R.\n4.1 Lemma. Let (W, I) be an odd family of subspaces and let \u03bb1 \u2208 A1 be a fixed\nodd parameter. Then the map W \u2192 W\u03bb given by w 7\u2192 w + \u03bbI(w) is an even linear\nbijection.\nProof. It is obvious that the given map is linear and even and (by definition of W\u03bb )\nsurjective. So suppose we have w + \u03bbI(w) = 0. If we multiply by \u03bb and use that\n\u03bb2 = 0, we get the equation \u03bbw = 0. But then we have\n0 = w + \u03bbI(w) = w \u2212 I(\u03bbw) = w \u2212 I(0) = w\n\nQED\n\nDefinition. Let (W, I) be an odd family of subspaces of V . We will say that (W, I)\nis an odd family decomposition of V if it satisfies the following two conditions:\n(i) the map I : W \u2192 V is injective and\n(ii) we have a direct sum decomposition V = W \u2295 I(W ).\n\n\fGEOMETRIC QUANTIZATION OF SUPERORBITS: A CASE STUDY\n\n9\n\nThe motivation for this definition is given by the following observations (which\nshould be compared with a Fourier transform, see also example [4.10]). We first\nnote that the space C \u221e (A1 , W ) of smooth functions f : A1 \u2192 W is isomorphic to\nBW \u2295 BW , the correspondence given by\nf (\u03bb) = w0 + \u03bbw1\n\n,\n\nwo , w1 \u2208 BW\n\nwhere smoothness of f forces us to take wi in the body of W . Now for any smooth\nodd map I : W \u2192 V we can define, using the Berezin integral, the map FI :\nC \u221e (A1 , W ) \u2192 BV by\nFI (f ) =\n\nZ\n\ne\u03bbI f (\u03bb) d\u03bb =\n\nZ\n\n(id + \u03bbI)(w0 + \u03bbw1 ) d\u03bb = w1 + I(w0 ) ,\n\nP\nn\nwhere the exponential map/series eA = \u221e\nn=0 A /n! defined for any linear map A\nis in this case a finite sum with only two terms because \u03bb2 = 0. Obviously the\nmap FI is a (linear) bijection if and only if I is injective and BV is the direct\nsum BV = BW \u2295 I(BW ), which is the case if and only if I is injective and we\nhave a direct sum V = W \u2295 I(W ). Tensoring with A, it is Q\nnot hard to Q\nshow that\nC \u221e (A1 , W ) \u2297 A is a graded vector space isomorphic to W \u2295 W where\ndenotes\nthe parity reversal operator. Moreover, FI extends to a smooth odd left-linear\nmap FI : C \u221e (A1 , W ) \u2297 A \u2192 V . This map is bijective (we may not call it an\nisomorphisms because it is not even) if and only if I is injective and we have the\ndirect sum decomposition V = W \u2295 I(W ).\nOn the other hand, for a fixed \u03bb \u2208 A1 the element w = f (\u03bb) belongs to W and\nthus\n\u0001\ne\u03bbI f (\u03bb) = (id + \u03bbI)(w) = w + \u03bbI(w)\n\nbelongs to W\u03bb . Our conditions for an odd family decomposition thus are the necessary and sufficient conditions to guarantee that each element of BV can be obtained\nas a Berezin integral of a smooth family of elements in W\u03bb , and thus, by tensoring\nwith A, that each element of V is the Berezin integral of a family of elements in\nW\u03bb .\nWhen we want to analyze more precisely the invariance properties of subspaces\nappearing in odd family decompositions, we will need a preliminary result concerning the notion of elements in A that are independent over R (or C if needed).\n4.2 Lemma. Let M be a supermanifold, let v1 , . . . , vn : M \u2192 V be n \u2208 N smooth\nmaps, let \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn \u2208 A be n fixed elements that are independent over R and let\nW \u2282 V be a graded subspace.P\nn\nIf the linear combination\ni=1 \u03bbi vi (m) belongs to W for all m \u2208 M , then vi\nmaps M into W for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n.\nRemark. If all the maps vi are constant (which happens if the manifold M is a\nsingle point), the smoothness conditions implies that all vi (m) belong to BV . And\nin that case we can be more precise, because then all vi (m) must lie in BW , not\njust to W .\nProof. If (x1 , . . . , xp , \u03be1 , . . . , \u03beq ) is a local system of even and odd coordinates on M\n(the xi even and the \u03bej odd), any smooth map f : M \u2192 V is determined (locally\n\n\f10\n\nG.M. TUYNMAN\n\non the given chart) by 2q ordinary smooth maps fP : Rp \u2192 BV , P \u2282 {1, . . . , q} by\n(4.3)\n\nf (x, \u03be) = f\u2205 (x) +\n\nq\nX\n\nX\n\n\u03beik * * * \u03bei2 * \u03bei1 * f{i1 ,...,ik } (x) .\n\nk=1 1\u2264i1 <***<ik \u2264q\n\nActually, the notation fP (x) should be interpreted as the extension of the smooth\nfunction on points with real coordinates in Rp to the smooth function on points\nwith arbitrary even coordinates in (A0 )p by Taylor expansion. Using the local\nP\ncoordinates (x, \u03be) thus tells us that ki=1 \u03bbi vi (x, \u03be) belongs to W for all (x, \u03be) in\nthe given chart. By taking derivatives at the point (Bx, 0) with respect to the odd\ncoordinates \u03bei1 , . . . , \u03beik we deduce that for all P \u2282 {1, . . . , q} the vector\nk\nX\n\n\u03bbi vi,P (Bx, 0)\n\ni=1\n\nbelongs to W for all (x, 0) in the given chart.\nNow let (el )l\u2208L be a basis for V such that a subset forms a basis of W . By the\nsmoothness assumption the vi,P (Bx, 0) have real coefficients with respect to this\nbasis. Let l \u2208 L be such that el is not in the basis for W and let ai \u2208 R be the\ncoefficients of vi,P (Bx, 0) with respect to this basis element. Then the condition\nPk\nPk\nthat i=1 \u03bbi vi,P (Bx, 0) belongs to W implies that we must have i=1 \u03bbi ai = 0.\nBut then independence of the \u03bbi over R implies that all ai must be zero. It follows\nthat the coefficients of each vector vi,P (Bx, 0) with respect to the basis element\nel is zero, showing that each vi,P (Bx, 0) separately belongs to W . But if these all\nseparately belong to W , then so do the linear combinations\nvi (m) =\n\nX\n\n(\u03be)P * vi,P (x, 0) .\n\nP \u2282{1,...,q}\n\nThis shows that all vi separately map the local chart into W . Since the local chart\nQED\nis arbitrary, the result follows.\n4.4 Corollary. Let M be a supermanifold, let v1 , . . . , vn : M \u2192 V be n \u2208 N\nsmooth maps, let \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn \u2208 A be n fixed elements, not all zero and let W \u2282 V\nbe a graded subspace.\nPn\nIf the linear combination i=1 \u03bbi vi (m) belongs to W for all m \u2208 M , then there\nexists 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n,\u0001 a permutation \u03c3 of {1, . . . , n} and a real valued matrix Aij \u2208\nM k \u00d7 (n \u2212 k), R such that\n(i) \u2200j = k + 1, . . . , n : \u03bb\u03c3(j) =\n\nk\nX\n\n\u03bb\u03c3(i) Aij\n\ni=1\n\n(ii) \u2200m \u2208 M \u2200i = 1, . . . , k : v\u03c3(i) (m) +\n\nn\nX\n\nAij v\u03c3(j) (m) \u2208 W .\n\nj=k+1\n\nProof. The subspace over R of A spanned by the \u03bbi has real dimension at most\nn and at least 1 because not all \u03bbi are zero. It follows that there exists 1 \u2264\nk \u2264 n, a permutation \u03c3 of {1, . . . , n} and a real valued matrix Aij such that\n\n\fGEOMETRIC QUANTIZATION OF SUPERORBITS: A CASE STUDY\n\n11\n\n\u03bb\u03c3(1) , . . . , \u03bb\u03c3(k) are indepenndent and such that the remaining \u03bb\u03c3(k+1) , . . . , \u03bb\u03c3(n)\nare linear combinations of them with real coefficients as in\n\u2200j = k + 1, . . . , n : \u03bb\u03c3(j) =\n\nk\nX\n\n\u03bb\u03c3(i) Aij .\n\ni=1\n\nFor 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k we now introduce the elements \u03bci = \u03bb\u03c3(i) and the smooth maps\nwi : M \u2192 V defined by\nn\nX\n\nwi = v\u03c3(i) +\n\nAij v\u03c3(j) .\n\nj=k+1\n\nThey are smooth because they are linear combinations with real coefficients of\nsmooth maps. We then have the equality (of smooth maps)\nn\nX\n\n\u03bbi vi =\n\n=\n\nn\nk\nX\nX\n\n\u03bb\u03c3(i) v\u03c3(i) =\n\nk\nX\n\nn\nk\n\u0010\n\u0011 X\nX\n\u03bci v\u03c3(i) +\n\u03bb\u03c3(i) Aij v\u03c3(j) =\n\u03bci wi .\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nk\nX\n\nn\nX\n\ni=1\n\n\u03bci v\u03c3(i) +\n\ni=1\n\nj=k+1\n\n\u03bb\u03c3(i) Aij v\u03c3(j)\n\nj=k+1 i=1\n\ni=1\n\nWe thus have k independent (over R) elements \u03bci and k smooth maps wi : M \u2192 V\nPk\nsuch that the linear combination i=1 \u03bci wi maps M into W . It then suffices to\nQED\ninvoke [4.2] to conclude.\n4.5 Nota Bene. The way to interpret [4.4] is as follows. If the n coefficients \u03bbi are\nnot independent, some will be a linear combination with\nP real coefficients of others.\nSubstituting these linear combinations in the sum i \u03bbi vi (m) thus contains less\nthan n coefficients \u03bbi because some are rewritten as a linear combination of others.\nNow reorder the terms in this sum in such a way that all terms with the same \u03bbi\nare grouped together. The corollary then says that the applications that are the\nseparate \"coefficients\" of each remaining \u03bbi map M to W .\n4.6 Lemma. Let (W, I) be an odd family of subspaces of V and let \u03bb 6= 0 be a\nfixed odd parameter. If the subspace W\u03bb is invariant under the action \u03a6, i.e., for\nall g \u2208 G we have \u03a6g (W\u03bb ) \u2282 W\u03bb , then the following two conditions are satisfied.\n(i) W itself is invariant under \u03a6, i.e., \u2200g \u2208 G: \u03a6g (W ) \u2282 W .\n(ii) W is invariant under all (odd) maps [ \u03a6g , I ] = \u03a6g \u25e6 I \u2212 I \u25e6 \u03a6g , i.e., \u2200g \u2208 G:\n[ \u03a6g , I ](W ) \u2282 W .\nConversely, if these two conditions are satisfied then all subspaces W\u03bc , \u03bc \u2208 A1 are\ninvariant under \u03a6.\nProof. Let g \u2208 G, w \u2208 W and \u03bc \u2208 A1 be arbitrary. Then, since \u03a6g is even and\nthus right- and left-linear, we have\n\u03a6g (w + \u03bcI(w)) = \u03a6g (w) + \u03bc\u03a6g (I(w)) = \u03a6g (w) + \u03bc [ \u03a6g , I ](w) + \u03bcI(\u03a6g (w))\n\u0001\n\u0001\n= \u03a6g (w) + \u03bc [ \u03a6g , I ](w) + \u03bcI \u03a6g (w) + \u03bc [ \u03a6g , I ](w) .\n\nIt follows immediately that if the conditions (i) and (ii) are satisfied, then W\u03bc is\ninvariant under \u03a6, simply because \u03a6g (w) + \u03bc [ \u03a6g , I ](w) belongs to W .\n\n\f12\n\nG.M. TUYNMAN\n\nFor the converse we suppose that W\u03bb is invariant under \u03a6. This means that for\nall w \u2208 W and all g \u2208 G there exists and element z \u2208 W such that\n(4.7)\n\n\u03a6g (w) + \u03bb\u03a6g (I(w)) = \u03a6g (w + \u03bbI(w)) = z + \u03bbI(z) .\n\nMultiplying this equation on the left with \u03bb gives us the equality \u03bb\u03a6g (w) = \u03bbz.\nSince z and thus \u03bbz belongs to W , it follows that \u03bb\u03a6g (w) belongs to W . If we take\nw \u2208 BW , then the map g 7\u2192 \u03a6g (w) is smooth. We thus can apply [4.2] to conclude\nthat \u03a6g (w) itself belongs to W . But \u03a6g is linear and BW generates W , so \u03a6g (w)\nbelongs to W for all g \u2208 G and all w \u2208 W , i.e., W is invariant under \u03a6, proving (i).\nNow using the linearity of I and substituting the equality \u03bb\u03a6g (w) = \u03bbz in (4.7),\nwe get\n\u03a6g (w) + \u03bb\u03a6g (I(w)) = z + \u03bbI(\u03a6g (w)) ,\nwhich gives us the solution for z as\n(4.8)\n\nz = \u03a6g (w) + \u03bb [ \u03a6g , I ](w) .\n\nWe know already that \u03a6g (w) belongs to W , so we deduce that \u03bb [ \u03a6g , I ](w) belongs\nto W . As before, we note that for w \u2208 BW the map g 7\u2192 [\u03a6g , I ](w) is smooth and\nthus by [4.2] [\u03a6g , I ](w) belongs to W . And again as before, BW generates W and\nthe map [\u03a6g , I ] is linear, so [\u03a6g , I ](w) belongs to W for all g \u2208 G and all w \u2208 W ,\nQED\nproving (ii).\n4.9 Definition. We will say that an odd family of subspaces (W, I) of V is invariant (under the action \u03a6) if the following two conditions are satisfied:\n(i) \u2200g \u2208 G: \u03a6g (W ) \u2282 W and\n(ii) \u2200g \u2208 G: [ \u03a6g , I ](W ) \u2282 W .\nAn invariant odd family decomposition of V is an odd family decomposition (W, I)\nof V such that (W, I) is invariant as an odd family of subspaces.\nRemark. It should be noted that if (W, I) is an invariant odd family of subspaces\nof V under the action \u03a6, then in particular W = W0 is an invariant subspace.\nHowever, it is quite possible that W = W0 is an invariant subspace without (W, I)\nbeing an invariant odd family, i.e., without any W\u03bb with \u03bb 6= 0 being invariant.\n4.10 Example. Consider the real graded space X of smooth functions on A1 with\nvalues in the complexified ring AC , f : A1 \u2192 AC . Since any such smooth function\nis of the form f (\u03be) = c0 + \u03be * c1 with ci \u2208 C, V has dimension 1|1. It follows that\nV = X \u2297 A is a graded vector space of graded dimension 1|1. On V we let act the\ngroup G = A1 by\n\u0001\n\u03a6\u03c4 (f \u2297 \u03b1) (\u03be) = f (\u03be \u2212 \u03c4 ) \u2297 \u03b1 .\n\nA basis for V is given by the functions f0 , f1 defined by f0 (\u03be) = 1 and f1 (\u03be) = \u03be.\nIn terms of this basis the action of G is given as\n\u03a6\u03c4 f 0 = f 0\n\nand\n\n\u03a6\u03c4 f 1 = \u03c4 * f 0 + f 1 .\n\nThe graded subspace W generated by f0 thus is an invariant subspace, but it does\nnot admit an invariant supplement. However, if we consider the odd right-linear\n\n\fGEOMETRIC QUANTIZATION OF SUPERORBITS: A CASE STUDY\n\n13\n\nmap I defined on W with values in V by I(f0 ) = i * f1 , then (W, I) is an invariant\nodd family decomposition of V . In fact, the subspace W\u03bb is given as\nW\u03bb = {c0 * f0 + \u03bbI(c0 * f0 ) | c0 \u2208 AC } = { (f0 + i\u03bb * f1 ) * c0 | c0 \u2208 AC } .\nBut the function f\u03bb = f0 + i\u03bb * f1 is defined as\nf\u03bb (\u03be) = f0 (\u03be) + i\u03bb * f1 (\u03be) = 1 + i\u03bb\u03be = ei\u03bb\u03be .\nAnd indeed \u03a6\u03c4 f\u03bb = e\u2212i\u03bb\u03c4 * f\u03bb . Moreover, any function f \u2208 V can be obtained as\na Berezin integral over a function of the form c0 (\u03bb) * ei\u03bb\u03be . This is exactly the odd\nFourier transform described (for instance) in [GS,\u00a77.1].\nDefinition. Let (W, I) be an odd family of subspaces of V and let \u03bb \u2208 A1 be fixed.\nWe will say that a linear subpace L \u2282 W\u03bb is a graded subspace of W\u03bb if there exists\na graded subspace X \u2282 W such that we have the equality L = X\u03bb where X\u03bb is\ndefined as\n(4.11)\n\nX\u03bb = {x + \u03bbI(x) | x \u2208 X} ,\n\ni.e., if L is the image of X under the even linear bijection W \u2192 W\u03bb given in [4.1].\nNote that a graded subspace of W\u03bb is in general not a graded subspace of V .\nProposition. Let (W, I) be an odd family of subspaces of V , let \u03bb \u2208 A1 be a fixed\nnon-zero odd element and let X \u2282 W be a graded subspace. If X\u03bb (see (4.11)) is\ninvariant under \u03a6 (i.e., \u03a6g (X\u03bb ) \u2282 X\u03bb for all g \u2208 G), then X\u03bc \u2282 W\u03bc is invariant\nunder \u03a6 for all \u03bc \u2208 A1 . Moreover, this is the case if and only if the following two\nconditions are satisfied:\n(i) \u2200g \u2208 G: \u03a6g (X) \u2282 X and\n(ii) \u2200g \u2208 G: [ \u03a6g , I ](X) \u2282 X.\nProof. (X, I|X ) is an odd family of subspaces and X\u03bb is invariant. The result then\nQED\nfollows from [4.6].\nDefinition. Let (W, I) be an odd family of subspaces of V . A graded subspace\nX \u2282 W is called an invariant subspace of the couple (W, I) if (X, I|X ) is an invariant\nfamily of subspaces.\nCorollary. If X is an invariant subspace of an odd family decomposition (W, I),\nthen not only X, but also X \u2295 I(X) is an invariant subspace of V under the action\n\u03a6. Moreover, (X, I|X ) is an invariant odd family decomposition of X \u2295 I(X).\nCorollary. Suppose (W, I) is an invariant odd family decomposition of V . If X\nand Y are two invariant subspaces of the odd family (W, I) and if W = X \u2295 Y ,\nthen (X \u2295 I(X)) \u2295 (Y \u2295 I(Y )) is a decomposition into two invariant subspaces of\nV , each of which admits an invariant odd family decomposition.\nThe two conditions given in [4.9] for an odd family of subspaces (W, I) to be\ninvariant are not independent in the sense that the second condition [ \u03a6g , I ](W ) \u2282\nW cannot be formulated when we do not know already the first condition. More\nprecisely, the map I is defined only on W , so for the map [ \u03a6g , I ] = \u03a6g \u25e6 I \u2212 I \u25e6 \u03a6g\nto make sense on W , we need to know that \u03a6g maps W into W .\n\n\f14\n\nG.M. TUYNMAN\n\nIn the situation of an odd family decomposition (W, I) of V we can make the\ntwo conditions independent by changing/extending the definition of an odd family\ndecomposition slightly. If I is injectiive and V = W \u2295 I(W ), we can extend the\nmap I : W \u2192 V to the whole of V by saying that on I(W ) \u2282 V it is the inverse\nof I. We then have an odd bijective smooth right-linear map I : V \u2192 V satisfying\nI \u25e6 I = idV such that V = W \u2295 I(W ). (Another way to state these conditions\nis to Q\nsay that we Q\nhave an isomorphism of graded vector spaces between V and\nW \u2295 W , where\nis the parity reversal operation.) Once we have defined I on\nthe whole of V , the two conditions for an odd family decomposition to be invariant\nare independent. Since this reformulation of an odd family decomposition will be\nusefull in other situations, we thus modify its definition.\nModified definition. An odd family decomposition of V is a couple (W, I) with\nW \u2282 V a graded subspace and I : V \u2192 V a smooth odd right-linear map satisfying\nI \u25e6 I = idV such that V is the direct sum of W and I(W ). It thus is in particular\nan odd family of subspaces of V .\nLet us now consider an odd family of subspaces (W, I) of V and an odd family\nof subspaces (X, J) of W . This means that W \u2282 V is a graded subspace, that\nI : W \u2192 V is a smooth odd right-linear map, that X \u2282 W is a graded subspace\nand that J : X \u2192 W is a smooth odd right-linear map. We then can use the\nsubspaces X\u03bc \u2282 W , \u03bc \u2208 A1 to define subspaces X\u03bc,\u03bb \u2282 W\u03bb \u2282 V by\n(4.12)\n\nX\u03bc,\u03bb = { (x + \u03bcJ(x)) + \u03bbI(x + \u03bcJ(x)) | x \u2208 X } .\n\nIt seems reasonable to call the collection (X\u03bc,\u03bb )\u03bc,\u03bb\u2208A1 a 2-dimensional odd family\nof subspaces of V . Since we are more interested in odd family decompositions of\nV , we will not formalize this general definition but we will concentrate on the odd\ndecomposition case with our modified definition.\nIf (W, I) is an odd family decomposition of V and if (X, J) is an odd family\ndecomposition of W , then we have the direct sum decomposition\nV = (X \u2295 J(X)) \u2295 I(X \u2295 J(X)) = X \u2295 J(X) \u2295 I(X) \u2295 I(J(X)) .\nMoreover, I maps V to itself and J maps W to itself. We now extend the map J\nto a map J \u2032 : V \u2192 V on the whole of V by\nJ \u2032 |W = J\n\nand\n\nJ \u2032 |I(W ) = \u2212I \u25e6 J \u25e6 I .\n\nThe extended (odd right-linear) map J \u2032 satisfies J \u2032 \u25e6 J \u2032 = idV and it commutes (in\nthe graded sense) with I, i.e., I \u25e6 J \u2032 = \u2212J \u2032 \u25e6 I on the whole of V . Moreover, if we\ndefine Z = X \u2295I(X), then (Z, J \u2032 ) is an odd family decomposition of V and (X, I|Z )\nis an odd family decomposition of Z.\nGoing one step further, we can consider an odd family decomposition (Y, K) of\nX. This gives us a direct sum decomposition of V as\nV = Y \u2295 K(Y ) \u2295 J(Y ) \u2295 J(K(Y )) \u2295 I(Y ) \u2295 I(K(Y )) \u2295 I(J(Y )) \u2295 I(J(K(Y ))) .\nThe map K : X \u2192 X can be extended to a smooth odd right-linear map K \u2032 : V \u2192\nV by\nK \u2032 |X = K\n\nK \u2032 |J(X) = \u2212J \u25e6 K \u25e6 J\n\n,\n\nK \u2032 |I(X) = \u2212I \u25e6 K \u25e6 I\n\n,\n\nK \u2032 |I(J(X)) = I \u25e6 J \u25e6 K \u25e6 J \u25e6 I .\n\n\fGEOMETRIC QUANTIZATION OF SUPERORBITS: A CASE STUDY\n\n15\n\nIt is not hard to see that K \u2032 \u25e6 K \u2032 = idV and that K \u2032 commutes (in the graded\nsense) with the maps I and J \u2032 . Moreover, it is not hard to show (for instance)\nthat (Y, J) is an odd family decomposition of Y \u2295 J(Y ), that (Y \u2295 J(Y ), K \u2032 ) is an\nodd family decomposition of Y \u2295 J(Y ) \u2295 K(Y ) \u2295 K \u2032 (J(Y )) and that (Y \u2295 J(Y ) \u2295\nK(Y ) \u2295 K \u2032 (J(Y )), I) is an odd family decomposition of V , simply because we have\nthe obvious equality of subspaces K \u2032 (J(Y )) = J(K(Y )).\nIn order to prepare the general definition of an n-dimensional odd family decomposition of V , we introduce some notation. Let I1 , . . . , In be n linear maps,\nlet \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn \u2208 A be n elements of the ring A and let P \u2282 {1, . . . , n} be any\nsubset written as P = {i1 , . . . , ik } with i1 < * * * < ik . We then define the element\n((\u03bb))P \u2208 A and the linear map ((I))P by\n((\u03bb))P = \u03bbik * * * \u03bbi2 * \u03bbi1\n\nand\n\n((I))P = Iik \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 Ii1 ,\n\nwith the convention that ((\u03bb))\u2205 = 1 and ((I))\u2205 = idV .

Let (W, I) be an odd family of subspaces of V , let (X, J) be an\nodd family of subspaces of W and let \u03bb, \u03bc \u2208 A1 be two fixed elements. If \u03bb\u03bc 6= 0\nand if the set X\u03bc,\u03bb (4.12) is invariant under the action \u03a6, then the following four\nconditions are satisfied:\n(i) \u2200g \u2208 G: \u03a6g (X) \u2282 X,\n(ii) \u2200g \u2208 G: [ \u03a6g , I ](X) \u2282 X,\n(iii) \u2200g \u2208 G: [ \u03a6g , J ](X) \u2282 X and\n(iv) \u2200g \u2208 G: [ [ \u03a6g , I ], J ](X) \u2282 X with [ [ \u03a6g , I ], J ] = [ \u03a6g , I ] \u25e6 J + J \u25e6 [ \u03a6g , I ]\nthe graded commutator.\nConversely, if these four conditions are satisfied, then all subspaces X\u03c1,\u03bd , \u03bd, \u03c1 \u2208 A1\n(4.12) are invariant under the action \u03a6.\nProof. The fact that X\u03bc,\u03bb is invariant under \u03a6 means that for all x \u2208 X there\nexists y \u2208 X such that\n\u0001\n(4.18) \u03a6g x + \u03bcJ(x) + \u03bbI(x) + \u03bbI(\u03bcJ(x)) = y + \u03bcJ(y) + \u03bbI(y) + \u03bbI(\u03bcJ(y)) .\n\nIf we multiply this equation on the left by \u03bc\u03bb, we get the equation\n(4.19)\n\n\u03bc\u03bb\u03a6g (x) = \u03bc\u03bby .\n\nSince y belongs to X, it follows that \u03bc\u03bb\u03a6g (x) belongs to X. If we now take x \u2208 BV ,\nthen the map g 7\u2192 \u03a6g (x) is smooth. By [4.2] and the fact that \u03bb\u03bc 6= 0, it follows\nthat \u03a6g (x) lies in X. But then, since X is generated by BX and since \u03a6g is linear,\n\u03a6g (x) lies in X for all x \u2208 X, which is condition (i).\nIf we multiply (4.18) on the left by \u03bc and substitute the result (4.19) (note that\nthe linear maps I and J are odd, as are \u03bb and \u03bc, so \u03bbI(\u03bcJ(y)) = \u03bc\u03bbI(J(y)) =\nI(J(\u03bc\u03bby))), we get the equation\n(4.20)\n\n\u03bc\u03a6g (x) + \u03bc\u03bb\u03a6g (I(x)) = \u03bcy + \u03bc\u03bbI(\u03a6g (x)) .\n\nSince we alreay know that \u03bcy and \u03bc\u03a6g (x) belong to X, it follows that \u03bc\u03bb [ \u03a6g , I ](x)\nbelongs to X. But then we can apply the same argument as for \u03bc\u03bb\u03a6g (x) to show\nthat [ \u03a6g , I ](x) itself belongs to X, which is condition (ii).\nWe now solve (4.20) for \u03bcy, which gives\n(4.21)\n\n\u03bcy = \u03bc\u03a6g (x) + \u03bc\u03bb [ \u03a6g , I ](x) ,\n\nand we substitute this together with (4.19) in (4.18) and multiply the result by \u03bb\non the left. This gives us the equation\n(4.22)\n\n\u03bb\u03a6g (x) + \u03bb\u03bc\u03a6g (J(x)) = \u03bby + \u03bb\u03bcJ(\u03a6g (x)) .\n\nAgain because we already know that \u03a6g (x) and y belong to X, it follows that\n\u03bb\u03bc [ \u03a6g , J ](x) belongs to X. And as before, it follows that [ \u03a6g , J ](x) belongs to\nX, which is condition (iii).\nSolving (4.22) for \u03bby, which gives \u03bby = \u03bb\u03a6g (x) + \u03bb\u03bc [ \u03a6g , J ](x), and substituting\nthis result as well as (4.21) and (4.19) in (4.18), we get the equation\n(4.23) \u03a6g (x) + \u03bc [ \u03a6g , J ](x) + \u03bb [ \u03a6g , I ](x) \u2212 \u03bb\u03bc\u03a6g (I(J(x)))\n= y + \u03bc\u03bbJ( [ \u03a6g , I ](x)) + \u03bb\u03bcI( [ \u03a6g , J ](x)) + \u03bb\u03bcI(J(\u03a6g (x))) .\n\n\f18\n\nG.M.

Let (W, I1 , . . . , In ) be an invariant n-dimensional odd family decomposition of V and let \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn \u2208 A1 be n odd elements. We will say that the subspace W\u03bb1 ,...,\u03bbn is irreducible if there exists no non-trivial graded subspace X \u2282 W\nsuch that the corresponding subspace X\u03bb1 ,...,\u03bbn \u2282 W\u03bb1 ,...,\u03bbn is invariant under \u03a6.\nNon-trivial meaning X 6= {0} and X 6= W .\nWhen one tries to find criteria for a subspace W\u03bb1 ,...,\u03bbn to be irreducible in\nterms of the graded subspace W and the maps Ii , then the description becomes\nvery rapidly very complicated. Let us briefly outline why by looking at subspaces\nX\u03bb1 ,...,\u03bbn \u2282 W\u03bb1 ,...,\u03bbn for n = 1 and n = 2.\n\n\f20\n\nG.M. TUYNMAN\n\nFor n = 1 the situation is rather easy: if a single X\u03bb with \u03bb 6= 0 is invariant, then\nall X\u03bc are invariant. And this is the case if and only if X itself is invariant under\nboth \u03a6g and [ \u03a6g , I1 ]. And X0 = X is invariant if and only if X is invariant under\n\u03a6 (a tautology). However, as can be seen in examples, it is quite possible that X0\n(which is X) is invariant but that no X\u03bb with \u03bb 6= 0 is invariant. There thus are\njust three cases: (i) all W\u03bb1 are irreducible, which is the case if W does not admit a\nnon-trivial invariant graded subspace; (ii) all W\u03bb1 with \u03bb1 6= 0 are irreducible but\nW0 is not, which is the case if and only if W admits a non-trivial invariant graded\nsubspace and if no invariant graded subspace of W is also invariant under the maps\n[ \u03a6g , I ]; (iii) none of the spaces W\u03bb1 is irreducible.\nBut already for n = 2 the situation becomes more complicated.\nIf we replace\nP2\nthe maps I1 , I2 by the maps J1 , J2 defined as Ji =\nj=1 aij Ij with aij \u2208 R,\nthen the triple (W, J1 , J2 ) satisfies the conditions of [4.13] if and only if the matrix\naij is orthogonal (belongs to O(2)). As W\u03bb1 ,\u03bb2 is defined by the map \u03bb1 I1 + \u03bb2 I2\n(4.15),Pit follows that the same subspace is defined by the map \u03bc1 J1 + \u03bc2 J2 with\n\u03bcj = i \u03bci aij , simply because it is the same map. Since there exist examples in\nwhich a subspace X\u03bb1 =0,\u03bb2 is invariant but X\u03bb1 ,\u03bb2 =0 is not (one of the \u03bb-parameters\nbeing zero and the other not), one could be tempted to think that it is simply a\ncase of looking at zero values for some of the parameters. But had we performed\nthe same computations using the \u03bc parameters, neither X\u03bc1 =0,\u03bc2 nor X\u03bc1 ,\u03bc2 =0\nwould have been invariant. As it turns out, the right approach is to distinguish\nthe following four cases for an invariant subspace X\u03bb1 ,\u03bb2 \u2282 W\u03bb1 ,\u03bb2 : (i) the product\n\u03bb1 \u03bb2 is non-zero, in which case all three elements \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 and \u03bb1 \u03bb2 are independent\nover R (in the R-algebra A); (ii) \u03bb1 \u03bb2 = 0 and \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 are independent over\nR; (iii) \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 are dependent over R but not both zero; and (iv) \u03bb1 = \u03bb2 = 0.\nAnd then the fact that it is an invariant subspace has to be translated into terms\ninvolving only the graded subspace W and the maps I1 and I2 .\nAs one can imagine, the case n = 3 is even more complicated. The right approach\nis to look at the number of independent elements over R among the 2n \u2212 1 = 7\nelements \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , \u03bb3 , \u03bb1 \u03bb2 , \u03bb1 \u03bb3 , \u03bb2 \u03bb3 , \u03bb1 \u03bb2 \u03bb3 (and which ones). We will not go\ninto a detailed analysis, but will restrict our attention to the case that will concern\nus in our study of the decomposition of the regular representation of our group G\nof section 3.\n4.26 Proposition. Let (W, I1 , I2 ) be an invariant odd family decomposition of V .\nIf there is no non-trivial graded subspace X \u2282 W which is invariant under all maps\n\u03a6g and [\u03a6g , I1 + aI2 ] (g \u2208 G and a \u2208 R), then all spaces W\u03bb1 ,\u03bb2 with \u03bb1 6= 0 are\nirreducible.\nProof. To show that none of the spaces W\u03bb1 ,\u03bb2 with \u03bb1 6= 0 admits a non-trivial\ninvariant subspace, we suppose that X\u03bb1 ,\u03bb2 is such a non-trivial invariant subspace.\nInvariance of X\u03bb1 ,\u03bb2 implies that for each x \u2208 X (and each g \u2208 G) there exists an\ny \u2208 X such that\nP2\nP2\n\u0001\n\u03a6g e i=1 \u03bbi Ii (x) = e i=1 \u03bbi Ii (y) ,\n\nwhich expands to\n\n(4.27) \u03a6g (x + \u03bb1 I1 x + \u03bb2 I2 x + \u03bb1 \u03bb2 I2 I1 x) = y + \u03bb1 I1 y + \u03bb2 I2 y + \u03bb1 \u03bb2 I2 I1 y\nMultiplying this by \u03bb1 \u03bb2 gives us the equation \u03bb1 \u03bb2 \u03a6g (x) = \u03bb1 \u03bb2 y, which we can\nsubstitute back into (4.27).

This is exactly what we have done in the proof of [4.17]. As in\nthat proof, we obtain the following expression for y in terms of x:\n(4.28)\n\ny = \u03a6g x + \u03bb1 [\u03a6g , I1 ]x + \u03bb2 [\u03a6g , I2 ]x + \u03bb1 \u03bb2 [[\u03a6g , I2 ], I1 ]x .\n\nWe now restrict attention to x \u2208 BX, which garantees that the maps\n(4.29)\n\ng 7\u2192 \u03a6g x\n\n,\n\ng 7\u2192 [\u03a6g , Ii ]x\n\nand g 7\u2192 [[\u03a6g , I2 ], I1 ]x\n\nare smooth. The important observation is that these x generate the whole of X\n(over A).\nWe now reason with respect to the different possibilities of independent (over\nR!) coefficients among the 4 coefficients appearing in (4.28): 1 (the coefficient\nof \u03a6g x), \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 and \u03bb1 \u03bb2 , just as suggested in the discussion above. Now if we\nhave a relation with real coefficients among these four elements, we can take the\nbody map to conclude that the coefficient of 1 must be zero. And if we separate\ninto homogeneous parts, we get a relation among \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 for the odd part and\na relation \"among\" \u03bb1 \u03bb2 for the even part. For \u03bb1 \u03bb2 there thus are just two\npossibilities: zero (if the coefficient of \u03bb1 \u03bb2 in the relation is non-zero) or not.\n\u2022 It is not hard to show that if \u03bb1 \u03bb2 6= 0, then \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 are also independent\nover R. All four elements are thus independent over R in A. Hence by [4.2] all four\nmaps in (4.29) lie in X. In particular \u03a6g x and [\u03a6g , I1 ]x \u2208 X. Since X is generated\nby our choice of x's and since this map is linear, it follows that X is invariant under\n\u03a6g and [\u03a6g , I1 + aI2 ] for a = 0.\n\u2022 If \u03bb1 \u03bb2 = 0, there are three possible cases to consider for the two elements \u03bb1\nand \u03bb2 : zero, one or two independent relations among them.\n- If there is no relation, then \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 are independent over R. As \u03bb1 \u03bb2 = 0,\nwe only have three terms in (4.28) with three independent elements over R in A.\nHence by [4.2] all three maps in (4.29) lie in X. In particular \u03a6g x and [\u03a6g , I1 ]x \u2208 X.\nAgain since X is generated by our choice of x's and since this map is linear, it follows\nthat X is invariant under \u03a6g and [\u03a6g , I1 + aI2 ] for a = 0.\n- If there is a single independent relation of the form b\u03bb1 + c\u03bb2 = 0 (not both\nb and c zero), we may assume that c 6= 0. Because when c = 0, we must have b 6= 0\nand then the relation would tell us that we have \u03bb1 = 0, contrary to the assumption\n\u03bb1 6= 0. We thus can rewrite the relation as \u03bb2 = a\u03bb1 with a = \u2212b/c. And then\nwe can apply [4.4] and [4.5] to conclude that the two functions \u03a6g x and the linear\ncombination [\u03a6g , I1 ]x + a[\u03a6g , I2 ]x belong to X. And as before, this implies that X\nis invariant under the maps \u03a6g and [\u03a6g , I1 + aI2 ].\n- The case of two independent relations among \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is excluded because\nthen both \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 must be zero, which is contrary to the assumption \u03bb1 6= 0.\n\u2022 The conclusion is that in all cases X is invariant under \u03a6g and under a map of\nthe form [\u03a6g , I1 + aI2 ] for some a \u2208 R. Since this is excluded by hypothesis, there\nQED\ndoes not exist a non-trivial invariant subspace of W\u03bb1 ,\u03bb2 .\n4.30 Proposition. Let (W, I1 , I2 , I3 ) be an invariant odd family decomposition of\nV . If there is no non-trivial graded subspace X \u2282 W which is invariant under all\nmaps \u03a6g and [\u03a6g , I1 + aI2 + bI3 ] (g \u2208 G and a, b \u2208 R), then all spaces W\u03bb1 ,\u03bb2 ,\u03bb3\nwith \u03bb1 6= 0 are irreducible.\nProof. To show that none of the spaces W\u03bb1 ,\u03bb2 ,\u03bb3 with \u03bb1 6= 0 admits a non-trivial\ninvariant subspace, we proceed as in the proof of [4.26]. We thus suppose that\n\n\f22\n\nG.M. TUYNMAN\n\nX\u03bb1 ,\u03bb2 ,\u03bb3 is such a non-trivial invariant subspace. Invariance of X\u03bb1 ,\u03bb2 ,\u03bb3 implies\nthat for each x \u2208 X (and each g \u2208 G) there exists an y \u2208 X such that\n\u03a6g e\n\nP3\n\ni=1\n\n\u03bbi Ii\n\nP3\n\u0001\n(x) = e i=1 \u03bbi Ii (y) ,\n\nwhich expands to\n3\n\u0010\nX\n\u03bbi Ii x +\n(4.31) \u03a6g x +\ni=1\n\nX\n\n1\u2264i<j\u22643\n\n=y+\n\n\u0011\n\u03bbi \u03bbj Ij Ii x + \u03bb1 \u03bb2 \u03bb3 I3 I2 I1 x\n\n3\nX\ni=1\n\n\u03bbi Ii y +\n\nX\n\n\u03bbi \u03bbj Ij Ii y + \u03bb1 \u03bb2 \u03bb3 I3 I2 I1 y\n\n1\u2264i<j\u22643\n\nMultiplying this by \u03bb1 \u03bb2 \u03bb3 gives us the equation \u03bb1 \u03bb2 \u03bb3 \u03a6g (x) = \u03bb1 \u03bb2 \u03bb3 y, which\nwe can substitute back into (4.31). If we then multiply by a double product \u03bbi \u03bbj ,\nwe can solve for \u03bbi \u03bbj y and substitute back. Continuing this process, we finally end\nup with the following expression for y in terms of x:\n(4.32) y = \u03a6g x+\n\nX\n\n\u03bbi [\u03a6g , Ii ]x+\n\ni\n\nX\n\n\u03bbj \u03bbi [[\u03a6g , Ii ], Ij ]x+\u03bb3 \u03bb2 \u03bb1 [[[\u03a6g , I1 ], I2 ], I3 ]x .\n\ni<j\n\nWe now restrict attention to x \u2208 BX, which garantees that the maps\ng 7\u2192 \u03a6g x ,\n\ng 7\u2192 [\u03a6g , Ii ]x ,\n\ng 7\u2192 [[\u03a6g , Ii ], Ij ]x and g 7\u2192 [[[\u03a6g , I1 ], I2 ], I3 ]x\n\nare smooth. As in the proof of [4.26], the important observation is that these x\ngenerate the whole of X (over A).\nWe now reason with respect to the different possibilities of independent coefficients among the 8 coefficients appearing in (4.32): 1 (the coefficient of \u03a6g x), \u03bb1 ,\n\u03bb2 , \u03bb3 , \u03bb1 \u03bb2 , \u03bb1 \u03bb3 , \u03bb2 \u03bb3 , \u03bb1 \u03bb2 \u03bb3 .\n\u2022 It is not hard to show that if \u03bb1 \u03bb2 \u03bb3 6= 0, then all these 8 elements are\nindependent over R in A. Hence by [4.2] we must have (among others) \u03a6g x \u2208 X as\n\"coefficient\" of 1 and [\u03a6g , I1 ]x \u2208 X as \"coefficient\" of \u03bb1 . Since X is generated by\nour choice of x's and since this map is linear, it follows that X is invariant under\n\u03a6g and [\u03a6g , I1 + aI2 + bI3 ] for a = b = 0.\n\u2022 If \u03bb1 \u03bb2 \u03bb3 = 0, we suppose that we have a relation (with real coefficients) among\nthe remaining 7 elements. By taking the body of this relation, it follows that the\nelement 1 does not appear (i.e., has coefficient zero in the relation). Next we use\nparity to split such a relation into two relations, one among the three odd elements\n\u03bbi and one among the three even elements \u03bbi \u03bbj (remember that 1 does not appear).\nSolving these relations for independent ones (and 1 is among the independent ones!)\nthus will tell us in particular that some of the \u03bbi are linear combinations of the\nothers. Using [4.4], [4.5] it then follows that the vectors appearing as \"coefficients\"\nof these independent elements belong to X.\n- The first case to consider is when all three \u03bbi are independent (over R),\nin which case it follows (among others) that \u03a6g x \u2208 X as \"coefficient of 1 and\n[\u03a6g , I1 ]x \u2208 X as \"coefficient\" of \u03bb1 and thus (as always because x \u2208 BX generate\nX and because the map is linear) that \u03a6g and [\u03a6g , I1 ] preserve X.\n\n\fGEOMETRIC QUANTIZATION OF SUPERORBITS: A CASE STUDY\n\n23\n\nP - If there is a single independent relation among the \u03bbi , we can write it as\ni ai \u03bbi = 0 for some ai \u2208 R, not all zero. But the case a2 = a3 = 0 is also\nexcluded as we suppose by hypothesis that \u03bb1 6= 0. Without loss of generality we\nthus may assume that a2 6= 0, which allows us to write \u03bb2 = \u2212(a1 \u03bb1 + a3 \u03bb3 )/a2\nand to say that \u03bb1 and \u03bb3 are independent over R. It then follows in particular\nthat [\u03a6g , I1 \u2212 (a1 /a2 )I2 ]x \u2208 X, this being the \"coefficient\" of \u03bb1 . And hence X is\ninvariant under [\u03a6g , I1 \u2212 (a1 /a2 )I2 ]. And if we look at the \"coefficient\" of 1, we\nfind as before that X is invariant under \u03a6g .\n- If there are two independent relations among the \u03bbi , this means that we can\nexpress two of them as multiples of the third. Since \u03bb1 6= 0, we may assume that\nit is \u03bb2 and \u03bb3 that are multiples of \u03bb1 , say \u03bb2 = a\u03bb1 and \u03bb3 = b\u03bb1 . But then the\n\"coefficient\" of \u03bb1 will be [\u03a6g , I1 + xI2 + yI3 ]x, which thus belongs to X and thus X\nis invariant under [\u03a6g , I1 + xI2 + yI3 ]. And as always, looking at the \"coefficient\"\nof 1 tells us that X is invariant under \u03a6g .\n- The case of three independent relations among the \u03bbi would mean that we\nhave \u03bbi = 0 for all i, which is excluded by the condition \u03bb1 6= 0.\n\u2022 The conclusion is that in all cases X is invariant under \u03a6g and under a map of\nthe form [\u03a6g , I1 + aI2 + bI3 ] for some a, b \u2208 R. Since this is excluded by hypothesis,\nQED\nthere does not exist a non-trivial invariant subspace of W\u03bb1 ,\u03bb2 ,\u03bb3 .\n5. The regular representation revisited\nIn order to cast our decomposition of the (left) regular representation of G into\nthe setting of odd family decompositions, we introduce 4 odd maps I0 , I4 , I5 and\nI6 on V (the space of (L2 ) functions on G) defined as\nI0 = i(\u03b2 + 12 a1 \u03b14 \u2212 21 a3 \u03b15 ) \u2212 i\u2202\u03b2\n\nI5 = i\u03b15 \u2212 i(\u2202\u03b15 + 12 a3 \u2202\u03b2 )\n\nI6 = i\u03b16 \u2212 i\u2202\u03b16\n\nI4 = i\u03b14 \u2212 i(\u2202\u03b14 \u2212 12 a1 \u2202\u03b2 ) .\n\nIf we apply a change of coordinates \u03b2 \u2192 \u03b3 = \u03b2 + 12 a1 \u03b14 \u2212 12 a3 \u03b15 , then these maps/\noperators take the simpler form\nI0 = i\u03b3 \u2212 i\u2202\u03b3\n\n,\n\nI4 = i\u03b14 \u2212 i\u2202\u03b14\n\n,\n\nI5 = i\u03b15 \u2212 i\u2202\u03b15\n\n,\n\nI6 = i\u03b16 \u2212 i\u2202\u03b16 .\n\nIt is not hard to show that these maps verify the conditions Ii \u25e6 Ii = idV and\ni 6= j \u21d2 [ Ii , Ij ] = 0. We define the graded subsapce E \u2282 V as consisting of\nfunctions independent of the odd variables \u03b14 , \u03b15 , \u03b16 and \u03b2, i.e., E is the space\nof (L2 ) functions of the four even (real) coordinates a1 , a2 , a3 and b. It thus has\nno odd dimensions. It is not hard to show that (E, I0 , I4 , I5 , I6 ) is a 4-dimensional\nodd family decomposition of V . More precisely, Ii with i = 4, 5, 6 adds a factor\n\u03b1i to a function in E, whereras I0 adds a factor \u03b3, which is essentially \u03b2. The\nvarious graded subspaces (I)P (E) thus contain the corresponding factors \u03b1 (and/\nor a modified \u03b2).\nTo make the link with the subspaces V(l0 ,l2 ,l3 ,\u03bb0 ,\u03bb4 ) given in \u00a73 we introduce the\nspace W(l0 ,l2 ,l3 ) consisting of functions (on G) of the form\n2\n\n3\n\n1\n\nf (ai , \u03b1j , b, \u03b2) = h(a1 , \u03b14 , \u03b15 , \u03b16 , \u03b3) * eil2 a * eil3 a * eil0 (b+ 2 a\n\n1 2\n\na )\n\n,\n\n\f24\n\nG.M.

Writing as before\nh\u01eb (a1 , \u03be) = h\u01eb,0 (a1 ) + \u03be * h\u01eb,1 (a1 ), each of the two components h\u01eb,0 and h\u01eb,1 transforms as the irreducible representation of the Heisenberg group. Since the function\n\n\f26\n\nG.M.

But V\u01eb,i is irreducible under this subgroup, thus H \u2229 V\u01eb,i is either V\u01eb,i\nor {0}. Now suppose that H \u2229 V\u01eb,0 = V\u01eb,0 , then V\u01eb,0 \u2282 H. But if we then act\nwith the second matrix of (5.6) on V\u01eb,0 \u2282 H we get V\u01eb,1 , which by invariance of\n\u01eb\nH must also lie in H. But then H = V\u01eb,0 \u2295 V\u01eb,1 = X(l\n. A similar argument\n0 ,l2 ,l3 )\napplies when H \u2229 V\u01eb,1 = V\u01eb,1 . And if both intersections yield {0}, we recall that an\ninvariant subspace is in particular a graded submodule, and thus the even and odd\n\u01eb\nparts of H are given by the intersections with the even and odd parts of X(l\n,\n0 ,l2 ,l3 )\ni.e., by H \u2229 V\u01eb,i . And thus if both are {0}, we must have H = {0}. This shows that\n\u01eb\nX(l\nis indeed irreducible.\n0 ,l2 ,l3 )\nTo finish the proof, we have to show that there are no other non-trivial invariant\nsubspaces when l0 is non-zero. We thus suppose that H is an invariant subspace\n\u01eb\n(now of the whole space X(l0 ,l2 ,l3 ) , not of a subspace X(l\n) and we consider\n0 ,l2 ,l3 )\n+\n\u2212\nan element h \u2208 H.

According to (5.5), if\nwe add the infinitesimal generators associated to the \u03b1\u03025 and \u03b1\u03026 actions we get\ninf(\u03b1\u03025 ) + inf(\u03b1\u03026 ) : h+ 7\u2192 \u22122\n\n\u2202h+\nand h\u2212 7\u2192 il0 \u03beh\u2212\n\u2202\u03be\n\nand for the difference of these two infinitesimal operators we get\ninf(\u03b1\u03025 ) \u2212 inf(\u03b1\u03026 ) : h+ 7\u2192 il0 \u03beh+ and h\u2212 7\u2192 \u22122\n\n\u2202h\u2212\n.\n\u2202\u03be\n\n\fGEOMETRIC QUANTIZATION OF SUPERORBITS: A CASE STUDY\n\n27\n\nWe now act first with the sum and then with the difference of these two operators\non our element h \u2208 H. Writing as before h\u01eb (a1 , \u03be) = h\u01eb,0 (a1 ) + \u03beh\u01eb,1 (a1 ), we thus\nobtain\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\ninf(\u03b1\u03025 ) \u2212 inf(\u03b1\u03026 ) inf(\u03b1\u03025 ) \u2212 inf(\u03b1\u03026 ) (h+ \u2295 h\u2212 ) (a1 , \u03be)\n= (\u22122il0 \u03beh+,1 (a1 )) \u2295 (\u22122il0 h\u2212,0 (a1 )) .\n\nSince H is invariant, this image belongs to H. But \u22122il0 \u03beh+,1 (a1 ) is the odd\npart of this image and \u22122il0 h\u2212,0 (a1 ) its even part. Hence \u03beh+,1 (a1 ) and h\u2212,0 (a1 )\nseparately belong to H (being a graded subspace). On the other hand, if we apply first the difference and then the sum, the parities are reversed and we obtain that \u03beh\u2212,1 (a1 ) and h+,0 (a1 ) separately belong to H. But then h+ (a1 , \u03be) =\nh+,0 (a1 ) + \u03beh+,1 (a1 ) and h\u2212 (a1 , \u03be) = h\u2212,0 (a1 ) + \u03beh\u2212,1 (a1 ) separately belong to H.\n\u01eb\n\u01eb\nIn particular we thus have h\u01eb \u2208 H \u2229 X(l\n.

If l0 is non-zero, then the representations V(l0 ,l2 ,l3 ,\u03bb0 ,\u03bb4 ) (5.2) with\n\u03bb0 6= 0 are irreducible.\nProof. According to [4.26] it suffices to show that there is no non-trivial subspace\nof X(l0 ,l2 ,l3 ) which is invariant under all maps \u03a6g and [ \u03a6g , I0 + xI4 ]. In [5.3] we\nhave shown that, when l0 6= 0, the only non-trivial invariant subspaces of X(l0 ,l2 ,l3 )\n\u00b1\nare X(l\n. It thus suffices to show that these subspaces are not invariant under\n0 ,l2 ,l3 )\nthe maps [ \u03a6g , I0 + xI4 ]. An elementary computation shows that we have, in terms\nof the functions t (5.1)\n([\u03a8\u011d , I0 + xI4 ]t)(a1 , \u03b15 , \u03b16 ) =\ni(\u2212\u03b2\u0302 + 12 \u00e21 \u03b1\u03024 \u2212 12 \u00e23 \u03b1\u03025 \u2212 \u03b1\u03024 a1 + \u00e23 \u03b15 \u2212 x\u03b1\u03024 ) * (\u03a8\u011d t)(a1 , \u03b15 , \u03b16 ) .\nThis computation is a (partial) confirmation that (X(l0 ,l2 ,l3 ) , I0 , I4 ) is indeed an\ninvariant 2-dimensional odd family decomposition. But more important is that it\nshows that the space of functions of the form (5.4) is not invariant under the maps\n[\u03c8\u011d , I0 + xI4 ], simply beacuse of the single \u03b15 factor in front of (\u03a8\u011d t)(a1 , \u03b15 , \u03b16 ),\nwhich does not come in the combination \u03b15 + \u01eb\u03b16 . It follows that V(l0 ,l2 ,l3 ,\u03bb0 ,\u03bb4 ) is\nQED\nirreducible.\nTo analyse the case l0 = 0, we start looking at the explicit transformation\nproperty of elements in X(0,l2 ,l3 ) in terms of the functions t (5.1) (see also (3.2),\n(3.4)) when l0 = 0. This gives us\n2\n\n3\n\n(\u03a8\u011d t)(a1 , \u03b15 , \u03b16 ) = t(a1 \u2212 \u00e21 , \u03b15 \u2212 \u03b1\u03025 , \u03b16 \u2212 \u03b1\u03026 ) * e\u2212il2 \u00e2 * e\u2212il3 \u00e2 .\nWith the results of \u00a73 in mind, we introduce the subspaces Y(l2 ,l3 ) \u2282 X(0,l2 ,l3 ) of\nfunctions independent of \u03b16 . It turns out that (Y(l2 ,l3 ) , I0 , I4 , I6 ) is an invariant\n3-dimensional odd family decomposition of W(0,l2 ,l3 ) for which the corresponding\nsubspaces indexed by odd parameters are exactly the spaces V(0,l2 ,l3 ,\u03bb0 ,\u03bb4 ),(\u03bb6 ) :\nV(0,l2 ,l3 ,\u03bb0 ,\u03bb4 ),(\u03bb6 ) = {e\u03bb0 I0 +\u03bb4 I4 +\u03bb6 I6 f | f \u2208 Y(l2 ,l3 ) } .\n\n\f28\n\nG.M.

In terms of the decomposition s \u223c\n= (s0 , s1 ), the last two\ntransformations in (5.7) are given by\n(s0 , s1 ) 7\u2192 (\u2212s1 , 0)\n\n,\n\n(s0 , s1 ) 7\u2192 (0, is0 ) .\n\nWe thus are in exactly the same situation as in the proof of [5.3] (except that we\nhave an action of the Heisenberg algebra instead of the Heisenberg group). As\nin the proof of [5.3] we thus may conclude that there does not exist a non-trivial\nQED\ninvariant subspace.\nTo finish our search for the decomposition into irreducible components, it thus\nremains to analyse the representations V(0,l2 ,l3 ,0,\u03bb4 ),(\u03bb6 ) , which are given in terms\nof the maps I4 and I6 by\nV(0,l2 ,l3 ,0,\u03bb4 ),(\u03bb6 ) = {e\u03bb4 I4 +\u03bb6 I6 f | f \u2208 Y(l2 ,l3 ) } .\nSee this way, these spaces represent a 2-dimensional odd family decomposition of\nthe space R(l2 ,l3 ) defined as\nR(l2 ,l3 ) = Y(l2 ,l3 ) \u2295 I4 (Y(l2 ,l3 ) ) \u2295 I6 (Y(l2 ,l3 ) ) \u2295 I6 (I4 (Y(l2 ,l3 ) )) .\n\n\fGEOMETRIC QUANTIZATION OF SUPERORBITS: A CASE STUDY\n\n29\n\nThere are two ways to see that these spaces decompose into 1-dimensional invariant\nspaces. The fast way is to introduce the subspace S(l2 ,l3 ) \u2282 Y(l2 ,l3 ) of functions that\nare independent of \u03b15 , meaning that the elements of S(l2 ,l3 ) are just (L2 ) functions\nof a single even variable a1 . It then is easy to show that (S(l2 ,l3 ) , I4 , I5 , I6 ) is a 3dimensional invariant odd family decomposition of R(l2 ,l3 ) . If we finally introduce\nthe (1-dimensional) spaces C(l1 ,l2 ,l3 ) consisting of functions (on G) of the form\nf (ai , \u03b1j , b, \u03b2) = c * ei(l1 a\n\n1\n\n+l2 a2 +l3 a3 )\n\n,\n\nthen S(l2 ,l3 ) is a direct integral of these spaces:\nZ\nS(l2 ,l3 ) = C(l1 ,l2 ,l3 ) dl1 .\nMoreover, this is an invariant decomposition which is compatible with the odd\nfamily decomposition (S(l2 ,l3 ) , I4 , I5 , I6 ). More precisely, each subspace C(l1 ,l2 ,l3 ) of\nS(l2 ,l3 ) (actually a generalized subspace in the sense of direct integral as opposed to\ndirect sum) not only is invariant under all maps \u03a6g , but also under all commutators\n[ [ \u03a6g , (I)]]P with P \u2282 {4, 5, 6}.\nIf one feels uneasy about distributing direct integrals over the odd-family decomposition, one can start with the subspace R(l2 ,l3 ) , which is the space of functions\non G of the form\n2\n\n3\n\nf (ai , \u03b1j , b, \u03b2) = s(a1 , \u03b14 , \u03b15 , \u03b16 ) * eil2 a * eil3 a .\nThe G-action on functions of this form, in terms of the function s, is given by\n2\n\n3\n\n(\u03a6\u011d s)(a1 , \u03b14 , \u03b15 , \u03b16 ) = s(a1 \u2212 \u00e21 , \u03b14 \u2212 \u03b1\u03024 , \u03b15 \u2212 \u03b1\u03025 , \u03b16 \u2212 \u03b1\u03026 ) * e\u2212il2 \u00e2 * e\u2212il3 \u00e2 .\nWe thus can perform a Fourier transform by introducing the spaces R(l1 ,l2 ,l3 ) of\nfunctions of G of the form\nf (ai , \u03b1j , b, \u03b2) = t(\u03b14 , \u03b15 , \u03b16 ) * ei(l1 a\n\n1\n\n+l2 a2 +l3 a3 )\n\n,\n\nwhich gives us the invariant direct integral decomposition\nZ\nR(l2 ,l3 ) = R(l1 ,l2 ,l3 ) dl1 .\nThe space C(l1 ,l2 ,l3 ) introduced above is (also) the subspace of R(l1 ,l2 ,l3 ) of functions independent of the odd variables \u03b14 , \u03b15 , \u03b16 . And it is not hard to show\nthat (C(l1 ,l2 ,l3 ) , I4 , I5 , I6 ) is an invariant 3-dimensional odd-family decomposition\nof R(l1 ,l2 ,l3 ) . The difference between this second approach and the first approach\nis that here we start with the direct integral decomposition and then introduce the\nodd-family decomposition, whereas in the first approach we start with the oddfamily decomposition and then perform the direct integral decomposition, which\nwe then have to \"distribute\" over the odd-family decomposition.\nThe final remark is that we have the equality\nV(0,l2 ,l3 ,0,\u03bb4 ),(l1 ,\u03bb5 ,\u03bb6 ) = { e\u03bb4 I4 +\u03bb5 I5 +\u03bb6 I6 f | f \u2208 C(l1 ,l2 ,l3 ) } .\n\n\f30\n\nG.M.

In order to find the irreducible components of V in terms of invariant odd familyRdecompositions, we started by applying a 3-dimensional Fourier\ntransform V = W(l0 ,l2 ,l3 ) dl0 dl2 dl3 .

Determination of the coadjoint orbits\nIn this section we determine the coadjoint orbits of our supergroup. It turns out\nthat there are four families of orbits: a family of 0|0 dimensional orbits with the\ntrivial symplectic form, a family of 2|2 dimensional orbits with an even symplectic\nform, a family of 2|2 dimensional orbits with an odd symplectic form and a fourth\nfamily of 3|3 dimensional orbits with a mixed symplectic form. The existence of\norbits with a mixed symplectic form was already estabilshed in [Tu10].\nA basis for the left-invariant 1-forms on G is given by dai , d\u03b1j and\ndb \u2212 21 a2 da1 + 21 a1 da2 \u2212 21 d\u03b15 * \u03b15 + 12 d\u03b16 * \u03b16\nd\u03b2 1 \u2212 12 \u03b14 da1 \u2212 12 \u03b15 da3 + 21 a1 d\u03b14 + 12 a3 d\u03b15 .\nThe corresponding basis of left-invariant vector fields is given by \u2202b , \u2202\u03b2 and\n\u2202a1 + 21 a2 \u2202b + 12 \u03b14 \u2202\u03b2\n\n,\n\n\u2202a2 \u2212 21 a1 \u2202b\n\n,\n\n\u2202a3 + 12 \u03b15 \u2202\u03b2\n\n\u2202\u03b14 \u2212 21 a1 \u2202\u03b2\n\n,\n\n\u2202\u03b15 + 12 \u03b15 \u2202b \u2212 21 a3 \u2202\u03b2\n\n,\n\n\u2202\u03b16 \u2212 21 \u03b16 \u2202b .\n\nThese vector fields can be identified with the given basis of E in the order k0 , k1 ,\ne1 , . . . , e6 .

Since the coordinates of \u03bco are real, we have in particular that\n\n\f32\n\nG.M. TUYNMAN\n\nthe odd coordinates of \u03bco are zero: \u03bei (\u03bco ) = \u03be\u0304j (\u03bco ) = \u03b7\u03040 (\u03bco ) = \u03b71 (\u03bco ) = 0. Since\nthe coordinates y0 and \u02331 are constant on the orbit, they remain the same real\nconstant. However, the other even coordinates are in general not constant on O\u03bco ,\nso we will denote the remaining even coordinates of \u03bco by xo1 , xo2 , xo3 , x\u0304o4 , x\u0304o5 , x\u0304o6 \u2208 R.\nThe odd coordinates \u03b7\u03040 = \u03b71 = 0 are also invariant under the coadjoint action, so\nthey remain constant equal zero on the orbit.

For y0 = \u02331 = 0, the base point \u03bco of the orbit O\u03bco is determined by\nthe 6 real values xo1 , xo2 , xo3 , x\u0304o4 , x\u0304o5 , x\u0304o6 , while all other coordinates are zero. Since\nthe coadjoint action reduces to the trivial action on such a point, O\u03bco = {\u03bco } is a\npoint and its symplectic form is the 2-form which is identically zero (which is indeed\nsymplectic as there are no non-zero tangent vectors). This gives us a 6-dimensional\nfamily of 0-dimensional orbits labeled by xo1 , xo2 , xo3 , x\u0304o4 , x\u0304o5 , x\u0304o6 .\nCase (ii). For \u02331 = 0 and y0 6= 0, the base point \u03bco is determined by the 7\nreal values xo1 , xo2 , xo3 , x\u0304o4 , x\u0304o5 , x\u0304o6 , y0 , while all other coordinates are zero. The\norbit has dimension 2|2 with even coordinates x1 , x2 and odd coordinates \u03be5 , \u03be6\n(all other coordinates on g\u2217 remain unchanged for such an orbit). Substituting\nthe fundamental vector fields associated to basis elements ei in the formula for the\nsymplectic form gives us the following identities\n\u03b9(\n\n\u2202\n1\n\u2202\n,\n)\u03c9 =\n\u2202x1 \u2202x2\ny0\n\n,\n\n\u03b9(\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n1\n,\n)\u03c9 = \u2212\n\u2202\u03be5 \u2202\u03be5\ny0\n\n,\n\n\u03b9(\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n1\n,\n)\u03c9 =\n,\n\u2202\u03be6 \u2202\u03be6\ny0\n\nall others being either zero or determined by graded skew-symmetry. From these\nidentities we deduce that the (even) symplectic form is given as\n\u03c9 = (y0 )\u22121 * ( dx2 \u2227 dx1 \u2212\n\n1\n2\n\nd\u03be5 \u2227 d\u03be5 +\n\n1\n2\n\nd\u03be6 \u2227 d\u03be6 ) .\n\nSince x1 and x2 are coordinates on such an orbit, the different orbits are labeled\nby xo3 , x\u0304o4 , x\u0304o5 , x\u0304o6 , y0 , thus giving a 5-dimensional family of 2|2-dimensional orbits\nwith an even symplectic form.\nCase (iii). For y0 = 0 and \u02331 6= 0, the base point \u03bco is again determined by\n7 real values, but now xo1 , xo2 , xo3 , x\u0304o4 , x\u0304o5 , x\u0304o6 , \u02331 , while all other coordinates are\nzero. The orbit dimension is still 2|2, but now with even coordinates x\u03044 , x\u03045 and\n\n\fGEOMETRIC QUANTIZATION OF SUPERORBITS: A CASE STUDY\n\n33\n\nodd coordinates \u03be\u03041 , \u03be \u03043 (as before, the other coordinates on g\u2217 remain unchanged on\nthis orbit).

In the last case y0 \u02331 6= 0 we have to be slightly more careful. The\nbase point is determined by the 8 real values xo1 , xo2 , xo3 , x\u0304o4 , x\u0304o5 , x\u0304o6 , y0 , \u02331 , while\nall other coordinates are zero. But the combinations s = y0 x\u03044 \u2212 \u02331 x2 and \u03c3 =\ny0 \u03be\u03043 + \u02331 \u03be5 are invariant under the group action. Since the base point of the\norbit has real coordinates, \u03c3 is zero at this point, and thus zero on the whole\norbit. We introduce the change of coordinates on g\u2217 involving only x2 , x\u03044 , \u03be\u03043 , \u03be5\nwhich change into x\u03022 , s, \u03c3, \u03be\u02c65 with x\u03022 = x2 and \u03be\u02c65 = \u03be5 . We then can use the\ncoordinates x1 , x\u03022 , x\u03045 , \u03be\u03041 , \u03be\u02c65 , \u03be6 as independent coordinates on the orbit, which thus\nhas dimension 3|3.

TUYNMAN\n\n7. Geometric quantization of the coadjoint orbits\nIn this section we discuss the general theory of geometric quantization of a symplectic supermanifold in the context of the coadjoint orbits of our supergroup G. As\nexplained in [Tu10] a prequantum bundle is a principal fiber bundle Y \u2192 O\u03bco with\na connection 1-form \u0393 whose curvature is the (Kostant-Kirillov-Souriau) symplectic\nform \u03c9. Since the symplectic form can be non-homogeneous, the structure group\nof Y will be (A0 /dZ) \u00d7 A1 of dimension 1|1 with d \u2208 (0, \u221e). On (A0 /dZ) \u00d7 A1\nwe will use coordinates (t, \u03c4 ) with t the canonical even coordinate on A0 modulo d\nand \u03c4 the canonical coordinate on A1 . The connection 1-form \u0393 on Y , an even Lie\nalgebra valued 1-form on Y , then takes the form\n\u0393 = \u03930 \u2297 \u2202t + \u03931 \u2297 \u2202\u03c4\nwith \u0393i a 1-form on Y of parity i. It is useful to identify \u0393 with the mixed 1-form\n\u03930 + \u03931 on Y and in the sequel we will often pretend that we have the equality\n\u0393 = \u03930 + \u03931 .\nIn our case the orbits all have a single global chart of the form (A0 )p \u00d7 (A1 )q ,\nhence are simply connected and thus the prequantum bundle is unique and of the\nform Y = O\u03bco \u00d7 (A0 /dZ) \u00d7 A1 . Moreover, there exists a global potential \u0398 for\nthe symplectic form \u03c9, i.e., d\u0398 = \u03c9. Splitting \u0398 in its homogeneous parts, the\nconnection 1-form \u0393 then is given as\n\u03930 = dt + \u03980\n\n,\n\n\u03931 = d\u03c4 + \u03981 .\n\nThe presence of the (canonical) momentum map on a coadjoint orbit implies\nthat the infinitesimal action of G on the orbit can be lifted to the prequantum\nbundle (in a way which is compatible with he momentum map). More precisely, if\n(v, z) \u2208 g is an element of the Lie algebra, the infinitesimal generator (v, z)Y of the\nlifted action on Y is determined by the equations\n\u03b9((v, z)Y |(\u03bc,t,\u03c4 ) )\u0393 = h(v, z)|\u03bci\n\nand\n\nL((v, z)Y )\u0393 = 0 .\n\nIn our examples, these infinitesimal actions on the prequantum bundles all integrate\nto an action of G, which we will provide.\nRemark. In the non-super orbit method, the lifting of the coadjoint action on\nan orbit to a prequantum bundle is equivalent to the existence of a character on\nthe isotropy subgroup of the base point whose infinitesimal form is the given base\npoint.\nAs in the son-super case, an invariant polarization on a coadjoint orbit O\u03bco\nthrough \u03bco \u2208 g\u2217 (where \u03bco has real coordinates) is a foliation which is maximal\nisotropic with respect to the symplectic form and which is invariant under the\ngroup action. And just as in the non-super case, such objects are in bijection with\n(graded) subalgebras h \u2282 g containing the stabilizer subalgebra g\u03bco and which are\nmaximal with respect to the condition h[h, h]|\u03bco i = 0.\nSince the vectors k0 , k1 generate the center of g, they always belong to a stabilizer subalgebra. On the other hand, since the commutator of two elements in g\nalways lies in the graded subspace generated by k0 , k1 , it follows easily that any\ngraded subspace containing the vectors k0 , k1 is a graded subalgebra. If we have a\n\n\fGEOMETRIC QUANTIZATION OF SUPERORBITS: A CASE STUDY\n\n35\n\nhomogeneous basis for h, then any commutator between two elements of h is either\na multiple of k0 or k1 , but never both at the same time, just because of a parity\nargument.\nThere are several equivalent ways to describe geometric quantization (without\nhalf-densities or half-forms). In the non-super case one can either look at the\nassociated complex line bundle L \u2192 O\u03bco and determine the sections that are covariantly constant in the direction of the (invariant) polarization, but one can also\nlook directly at functions on the principal circle bundle Y \u2192 O\u03bco that satisfy\ntwo conditions: (i) equivariance with respect to the action of the structure group\nS1 and (ii) constant in the direction of the horizontally lifted (invariant) polarization. The lifted action of G to the principal bundle Y preserves the space of\nfunctions determined by the second method (using the induced action on functions (g * f )(y) = f (g \u22121 y)). This is the representation of G obtained by geometric\nquantization of the orbit.\nIn the super case we have to be a bit more devious because of the odd dimension\nof the structure group. We thus introduce two parameters, one even (real) ~ and one\nodd \u03ba. The first is usually introduced in physics and can (without loss of generality)\nbe put equal to 1. We will not do so here in order to maintain a minimum of equality\nbetween the even and odd coordinates on the structure group. On the other hand,\nwe cannot fix a specific value of \u03ba except \u03ba = 0 because else we obtain results\nthat are no longer within the category of graded manifolds (see [Tu04] for details).\nWe thus are obliged to keep it as a free parameter. With this in mind, the two\nconditions imposed on functions f : Y \u2192 AC on Y by geometric quantization\nbecome (7.1) and (7.2):\n(7.1)\n\nf (y * (t, \u03c4 )) = ei\u03c4 \u03ba+it/~ * f (y) ,\n\nwhere y * (t, \u03c4 ) denotes the right-action of the structure group on the principal\nbundle and where ei\u03c4 \u03ba+it/~ * f (y) denotes the usual multiplication in AC .\n(7.2)\n\n(v, z)h f = 0\n\nfor all (v, z) \u2208 g, where (v, z)h is the horizontal lift to Y of the fundamental vector\n\u2217\nfield (v, z)g . It (thus) satisfies the condition \u03b9((v, z)h )\u0393 = 0. In our situation is is\nnecessarily of the global form\n\u2217\n\n(v, z)h = (v, z)g + p0 * \u2202t + p1 * \u2202\u03c4 .\nThe coefficients pi are determined by the equations \u03b9((v, z)h )\u0393i = 0.\nRemark. For the even part A0 /dZ of the structure group we already have a parameter d \u2208 R>0 and the choice of ~ must be compatible with d in the sense that\nd/~ must be a multiple of 2\u03c0 in order that condition (i) doesn't reduce to the condition that f must be identically zero. The parameter d was introduced for the\ngeneral case, in which the symplectic form is not exact, but has a non-trivial group\nof periods. It should satisfy the condition that the group of periods is included in\ndZ. In our situation here the group of periods reduces to {0}, so no restriction is\nimposed a priori on d.\nRemark. The parameter \u03ba is not discussed in [Tu10]. Its presence here will turn\nout to be crucial if we want to obtain a match between the irreducible representations found in the regular representation and the representations obtained by\ngeometric quantization of coadjoint orbits.\n\n\f36\n\nG.M. TUYNMAN\n\n8. Orbits of dimension 0|0\nSince the orbit is a point, the prequantum bundle is {\u03bco }\u00d7(A0 /dZ)\u00d7A1 together\nwith the connection 1-form \u0393 = dt + d\u03c4 . Since the canonical momentum map takes\nthe (constant) value \u03bco , the lifted vector fields (v, z)Y are given by\n\u0001 \u2202\n\u0001 \u2202\n+ v 4 x\u0304o4 + v 5 x\u0304o5 + v 6 x\u0304o6 *\n,\n(v, z)Y = v 1 xo1 + v 2 xo2 + v 3 xo3 *\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03c4\nIt follows immediately that the lifted action is given by\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\nt\nt \u2212 a1 xo1 \u2212 a2 xo2 \u2212 a3 xo3\n(8.1)\ng\u2208G:\n.\n7\u2192\n\u03c4\n\u03c4 \u2212 \u03b14 x\u0304o4 \u2212 \u03b15 x\u0304o5 \u2212 \u03b16 x\u0304o6\nFor a point orbit \u03bco , the stabilizer subgroup G\u03bco is the whole group. An invariant\npolarization thus corresponds necessarily to h = g. Since the orbit dimension is 0|0,\nthis corresponds to the trivially zero foliation on the 0-dimensional manifold.\nSmooth functions on Y = (A0 /dZ)\u00d7A1 satisfying condition (7.1) are determined\nby a complex number c \u2208 C as\nf (t, \u03c4 ) = c * ei\u03c4 \u03ba+it/~ ,\nwhereas the second condition (7.2) is void. These functions constitute a 1-dimensional graded vector space of dimension 1|0. The induced action of G on such a\nfunction is given (using (8.1)) as\n(g * f )(t, \u03c4 ) = f (g \u22121 (t, \u03c4 )) = f (t + a1 xo1 + a2 xo2 + a3 xo3 , \u03c4 + \u03b14 x\u0304o4 + \u03b15 x\u0304o5 + \u03b16 x\u0304o6 )\n(8.2)\n\n4\n\n= ei(\u03b1\n\n5 o\n6 o\n1 o\n2 o\n3 o\nx\u0304o\n4 +\u03b1 x\u03045 +\u03b1 x\u03046 )\u03ba+i(a x1 +a x2 +a x3 )/~\n\n* f (t, \u03c4 ) .\n\n9. Orbits of dimension 2|2 with an even symplectic form\nAs said in \u00a77, the prequantum bundle is just the direct product Y = O\u03bco \u00d7\n(A0 /dZ) \u00d7 A1 . Using the explicit expression of the symplectic form, it is not hard\nto see that a connection form \u0393 is given by\n\u03930 = dt + (y0 )\u22121 (\u2212x1 dx2 \u2212 12 \u03be5 d\u03be5 + 12 \u03be6 d\u03be6 )\n\nand\n\n\u03931 = d\u03c4 .\n\nWith this choice, the lifted fundamental vector fields (v, z)Y are given by\n\u0010\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202 \u0011\n(v, z)Y = y0 * v 2 *\n\u2212 v1 *\n\u2212 v5 *\n+ v6 *\n\u2202x1\n\u2202x2\n\u2202\u03be5\n\u2202\u03be6\n\u0001\n\u2202\n+ v 2 x2 + v 3 xo3 \u2212 12 v 5 \u03be5 \u2212 12 v 6 \u03be6 + z 0 y0 *\n\u2202t\n\u0001 \u2202\n4 o\n5 o\n6 o\n,\n+ v x\u03044 + v x\u03045 + v x\u03046 *\n\u2202\u03c4\nwhich integrate to an action of G on Y by\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nx1 \u2212 y0 a2\nx1\n1\nx2 + y0 a\n\uf8ec x2 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u03be5 + y0 \u03b15\n\uf8ec \u03be5 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n(9.1) g \u2208 G : \uf8ec \uf8f7 7\u2192 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u03be6 \u2212 y0 \u03b16\n\uf8ec \u03be6 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\uf8ed t \u2212 a2 x \u2212 a3 xo + 1 \u03b15 \u03be + 1 \u03b16 \u03be \u2212 by \u2212 1 y a1 a2 \uf8f8\nt\n2\n5\n6\n0\n0\n3\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c4\n\u03c4 \u2212 \u03b14 x\u0304o4 \u2212 \u03b15 x\u0304o5 \u2212 \u03b16 x\u0304o6\n\n\fGEOMETRIC QUANTIZATION OF SUPERORBITS: A CASE STUDY\n\n37\n\nFor all these orbits the stabilizer subgroup G\u03bco is given by\nG\u03bco = {(ai , \u03b1j , b, \u03b2) | a1 = a2 = \u03b15 = \u03b16 = 0} .\nThe stabilizer subalgebra g\u03bco of dimension 2|2 thus is generated by the vectors\ne3 , e4 , k0 , k1 . If a subalgebra h \u2283 g\u03bco has even dimension 4, then necessarily it\ncontains all 4 even vectors e1 , e2 , e3 , k0 . But then\nh [ e1 , e2 ] |\u03bco i = h \u2212 k0 |\u03bco i = \u2212y0 6= 0 .\nHence for a polarization the even dimension of h is at most 3. Similarly, if h has\nodd dimension 4, then it necessarily contains all odd vectors e4 , e5 , e6 , k1 and in\nparticular e5 . And then we have\nh [ e5 , e5 ] |\u03bco i = y0 6= 0 .\nSince the same argument applies to e6 , it follows that the odd dimension of h for\na polarization is at most 3 and that h cannot contain the (isolated) vectors e5 or\ne6 . On the other hand, it is easy to check that the subalgebra h of dimension 3|3\ngenerated by the vectors ae1 + be2 , e3 , e4 , e5 \u2212 \u01ebe6 , k0 , k1 with |a|2 + |b|2 = 1 and\n\u01eb = \u00b11 satisfies the condition h [ h, h ] |\u03bco i = 0.

A detailed analysis of dimensions\n3|2 and 2|3 shows that that the only possibilities are the following: for dimension\n3|2 there is a single h possible, generated by e2 , e3 , e4 , k0 , k1 and for dimension 2|3\nthere are exactly two possibilities, generated by e2 , e4 , e5 + \u01ebe6 , k0 , k1 , \u01eb = \u00b11.\nAs in the previous cases, functions f on Y satisfying condition (7.1) are determined by functions g on the orbit according to\n(11.2)\n\nf (x1 , x\u03022 , x\u03045 , \u03be\u03041 , \u03be\u02c65 , \u03be6 , t, \u03c4 ) = ei\u03c4 \u03ba+it/~ * g(x1 , x\u03022 , x\u03045 , \u03be \u03041 , \u03be\u03025 , \u03be6 ) .\n\n\u2022 The invariant polarization corresponding to the subalgebra of dimension 3|2 corresponds to the foliation on the orbit generated by the vector fields\n\u2202x1\n\n,\n\nand\n\n\u2202x\u03045\n\n\u2202\u03be\u03041 .\n\nThe horizonal lifts are given by \"the same\" vector fields, hence we have to look for\nfunctions g determined by functions h of one even and two odd variables according\nto\ng(x1 , x\u03022 , x\u03045 , \u03be\u03041 , \u03be\u03025 , \u03be6 ) = h(x\u03022 , \u03be\u03025 , \u03be6 ) .\nThe induced action of G on such a function is given (using (11.1)) as\n(\u03a6g f )(x1 , x\u03022 , x\u03045 , \u03be\u03041 , \u03be\u02c65 , \u03be6 , t, \u03c4 ) = h(x\u03022 \u2212 y0 a1 , \u03be\u03025 \u2212 y0 \u03b15 , \u03be6 + y0 \u03b16 ) * ei\u03c4 \u03ba+it/~\n* ei(a\n\n2\n\n1 2\n1 5\n1 6\n1\nx\u03022 +a3 xo\n3 +by0 \u2212 2 \u03b1 \u03be\u03025 \u2212 2 \u03b1 \u03be6 \u2212 2 y0 a a )/~\n\n* ei(a\n\n3\n\n1 4\n3 5\n1\n1\n1\n\u03be\u03043 +\u03b14 x\u03044 +\u03b16 x\u0304o\n6 +b \u02331 \u2212 2 \u02331 a \u03b1 + 2 \u02331 a \u03b1 )\u03ba\n\n,\n\nwhere as before the dependent functions \u03be\u03043 and x\u03044 represent the functions \u2212y0\u22121 \u02331 \u03be\u02c65\nand y0\u22121 (so + \u02331 x\u03022 ) = y0\u22121 (y0 x\u0304o4 \u2212 \u02331 xo2 + \u02331 x\u03022 ) respectively.

Recapitulation and comparison\nIf we gather the results for all orbits, we get the following list:\n(i) For each 0|0-dimensional orbit we have a (1-dimensional) representation.\n(ii) For each 2|2-dimensional orbit with an even symplectic form we have two\ndifferent representations by functions on a 1|1-dimensional manifold.\n(iii) For each 2|2-dimensional orbit with an odd symplectic form we have three\ndifferent representations by functions on a manifold of dimension 2|0, 0|2\nand 1|1 respectively.\n(iv) For each 3|3-dimensional orbit (with a mixed symplectic form) we have three\ndifferent representations, two by functions on a manifold of dimension 2|1\nand one on a manifold of dimension 1|2.\nIn order to compare this list with the representations we found in the regular\nrepresentation in \u00a73, we start with the spaces V(0,l2 ,l3 ,0,\u03bb4 ),(l1 ,\u03bb5 ,\u03bb6 ) . Comparison of\nthe G action given in (3.10) with the action given in the representation associated\nto a 0|0-dimensional orbit (8.2) tells us that they are the same, provided we make\nthe following identifications\nl1\n\u03bb4\n\n=\n=\n\n\u2212xo1 /~\n\u2212x\u0304o4 \u03ba\n\n,\n,\n\nl2\n\u03bb5\n\n=\n=\n\n\u2212xo2 /~\n\u2212x\u0304o5 \u03ba\n\n,\n,\n\nl3\n\u03bb6\n\n=\n=\n\n\u2212xo3 /~\n\u2212x\u0304o6 \u03ba .\n\nInstead of commenting directly on these identifications, let us first complete our\nlist, starting with V(0,l2 ,l3 ,\u03bb0 ,\u03bb4 ),(\u03bb6 ) with \u03bb0 6= 0. Comparing the action (3.9) with\nthe action given in the representation associated to a 2|2-dimensional orbit with\nan odd symplectic form and a 1|1-dimensional polarization (10.3) tells us that they\nare the same, provided we make the identifications\n0\n\u03bb0\n\n=\n=\n\n\u2212xo1 /~\n\u2212\u02331 \u03ba\n\n,\n,\n\nl2\n\u03bb4\n\n=\n=\n\n\u2212xo2 /~\n\u2212x\u0304o4 \u03ba\n\n,\n,\n\nl3\n\u03bb6\n\n=\n=\n\n\u2212xo3 /~\n\u2212x\u0304o6 \u03ba .\n\nWe then turn our attention to V(l\u00b10 ,l2 ,l3 ,0,\u03bb4 ) with l0 6= 0. Comparing the action (3.7) with the action (9.3) given in the representations associated to a 2|2dimensional orbit with an even symplectic form tells us that they are the same,\nprovided we make the identifications\nl0\n\u03bb4\n\n= \u2212y0 /~\n= \u2212x\u0304o4 \u03ba\n\n,\n,\n\nl2\n0\n\n=\n=\n\n\u2212xo2 /~\n\u2212x\u0304o5 \u03ba\n\n,\n,\n\nl3\n0\n\n=\n=\n\n\u2212xo3 /~\n\u2212x\u0304o6 \u03ba .\n\n\fGEOMETRIC QUANTIZATION OF SUPERORBITS: A CASE STUDY\n\n45\n\nWe finally look at V(l0 ,l2 ,l3 ,\u03bb0 ,\u03bb4 ) with l0 6= 0 6= \u03bb0 . Comparing the action (3.4)\nwith the action (11.3) given in the representation associated to a 3|3-dimensional\norbit with a 2|1-dimensional polarization tells us that they are the same, provided\nwe make the identifications\nl0\n\u03bb0\n\n= \u2212y0 /~\n= \u2212\u02331 \u03ba\n\n,\n,\n\nl2\n\u03bb4\n\n=\n=\n\n\u2212xo2 /~\n\u2212x\u0304o4 \u03ba\n\n,\n,\n\nl3\n0\n\n=\n=\n\n\u2212xo3 /~\n\u2212x\u0304o6 \u03ba .\n\nIf we look at the required identifications, we see that they all have the same\nform. The even parameters l0 , l1 , l2 , l3 have to be the same as the coordinates\nof the basepoint \u03bco of the orbit y0 , xo1 , xo2 , xo3 up to a factor \u2212~. And the odd\nparameters \u03bb0 , \u03bb4 , \u03bb5 , \u03bb6 have to be the same as the coordinates (of \u03bco ) \u02331 , x\u0304o4 ,\nx\u0304o5 , x\u0304o6 up to a factor \u2212\u03ba. But here the situation is not as simple as for the even\nparameters. For the even parameters we performed a honest Fourier transform of\n(smooth) functions of even coordinates. As such the even parameters l0 , l1 , l2 , l3\nthus are real. And identifying them up to a factor \u2212~ with the real coordinates y0 ,\nxo1 , xo2 , xo3 poses no problem. On the other hand, the parameters \u03bb0 , \u03bb4 , \u03bb5 , \u03bb6 are\nodd, so identifying them with the real coordinates \u02331 , x\u0304o4 , x\u0304o5 , x\u0304o6 is not obvious. But\nas said, it should be up to the odd factor \u03ba. But then all four odd parameters \u03bb0 ,\n\u03bb4 , \u03bb5 , \u03bb6 should be real multiples of the same odd factor \u03ba. Which would suggest\nthat we cannot choose these four parameters freely.\nWe thus reach the unsatisfactory situation that we have a nice identification\nbetween the irreducible representations appearing in the regular representation and\nrepresentations associated to coadjoint orbits, but there is nevertheless something\nstrange about this identification. If we take the odd parameters seriously, then we\nare embarrased by the fact that the identification makes them all real multiples of\nthe same odd factor. However, the sufficient conditions for irreducibility involve\n(in)dependence of the odd parameters over R, which seems to indicate thatthere is\na link between the odd parameters and real coefficients.\nAnother point which we have not addressed here is how to define a scalar product\non the representation obtained by geometric quantization. It is fairly easy to see\nthat the natural scalar product consisting of integrating over the coordinates on\nwhich the functions depend will yield an invariant non-degenerate sesquilinear form.\nBut when the odd dimension is odd (no pun intended; it is the case for the 2|2dimensional orbit with an even form, for the 2|2-dimensional orbit with an odd form\nand the 3|3-dimensional polarization and for the 3|3-dimensional orbit with the 2|3dimensional polarization), this form will be an odd sesquilinear form. Which means\nthat if we take this approach seriously, then the notion of unitary representations in\nthe super setting should not restrict attention to even non-degenerate sesquilinear\nforms.\nA third problem to which I have not (yet) found a satisfactory answer is how to\ndefine the notion of equivalent representations for odd family decompositions. In\nview of my claim in the introduction that the orbits with a non-homogeneous symplectic form are necessary, this is an important question. And indeed, if for some\nnotion of equivalence the representations associated to the orbits with a non-even\nsymplectic form are all equivalent to representations obtained from an orbit with an\neven symplectic form, then the orbits with a non-homogeneous symplectic form are\nnot needed. Fortunately for me, for any reasonable definition of equivalence, the\nrepresentations associated to an orbit with a non-homogeneous symplectic form\ncannot be equivalent to representations obtained via another type of orbit. To\n\n\f46\n\nG.M. TUYNMAN\n\nsubstantiate this claim, it suffices to look at the subgroup H of G in which all\nbut a1 , a2 and b are non-zero. This H is the classical Heisenberg group. A direct computation shows that the representations V(l0 ,l2 ,l3 ,\u03bb0 ,\u03bb4 ) with l0 6= 0 and\n\u03bb0 6= 0 decompose into four copies of the (infinite dimensional) irreducible representation of this Heisenberg subgroup. On the other hand, the representations\nV(l\u00b10 ,l2 ,l3 ,0,\u03bb4 ) decompose as a direct sum of just two copies. And the representations\nV(l0 ,l2 ,l3 ,\u03bb0 ,\u03bb4 ),(\u03bb6 ) do not contain this irreducible representation of H. It follows\nthat they cannot be isomorphic under any reasonable notion of equivalence.\nAs the reader can see, there remain a lot of questions to be answered. However,\nI hope to have convinced her/him that symplectic supermanifolds with a nonhomogeneous symplectic form are interesting objects to study.\nReferences\n[DW] B.
