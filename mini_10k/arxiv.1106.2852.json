Ba\u00f1ados, Silk and West [1]\nshowed that particles falling from rest outside an extremal Kerr black hole\n(a = M ) can collide with arbitrarily high center of mass energies when\nthe collision occurs arbitrarily close to the horizon. The BSW mechanism\nhas been further discussed and generalized to different spacetimes (See\ne.g. [2]-[7] ). Jacobson and Sotiriou [8] pointed out that infinite energies\nfor the colliding particles can only be attained at infinite time. Authors\nalso argued [9] that such a high energy may not be realizable due to the\ntheoretical upper bound a/M = 0.998 [10]. The BSW mechanism would\nbe more realistic if it worked for non-extremal Kerr black holes (a < M ).\nAlthough numerical analysis indicates that the collision energies are finite\nnear the horizon of a non-extremal Kerr black hole, no rigorous proof has\nbeen given. In this paper, we prove analytically that infinite center of mass\n\u2217 Email:\n\u2020 Email:\n\nsijie@bnu.edu.cn\ncczhong@mail.bnu.edu.cn\n\n1\n\n\fenergies can never be attained outside a non-extremal Kerr black holes.\nCompared with previous literature, our proof is general in the following\nsenses. Firstly, the collision takes place anywhere outside the black hole,\nnot confined to the equatorial plane \u03b8 = \u03c02 . Secondly, we allow the 4velocities of the two particles to be arbitrary. In particular, the 4-velocities\nhave non-vanishing \u03b8\u0307 components. Finally, we release the restriction that\nparticles fall from infinity, allowing them to fall from anywhere outside the\nblack hole. Our analysis shows that infinite energies can only be attained at\nthe horizon and one of the particles must have a critical angular momentum.\nHowever, with such an angular momentum, there always exists a potential\nbarrier outside the black hole preventing the particle from approaching the\nevent horizon.\nSince the event horizon of a non-extremal Kerr black hole cannot serve\nas a particle accelerator creating infinite collision energies, it is natural to\nask whether the inner horizon can make a difference. This issue has recently\nbeen explored by Lake [11]. The author claimed in the original version\nthat the center of mass energy for two colliding particles is generically\ndivergent at the inner horizon and no fine tuning is required. Then in the\nErratum this claim was withdrawn because physical constraints forbid such\ncollisions. We reexamine this issue in details and arrive at the following\nconclusions. We first confirm, using different arguments, that a generic\ndivergence at the inner horizon is not possible. We further show that for a\ncritical angular momentum, the center of mass energy diverges at the inner\nhorizon. Such a divergence is similar to that proposed by BSW where a\ncritical angular momentum also is required. The difference is that there\nis no restriction on the spin parameter a. So in principle, infinite collision\nenergies can be obtained near the inner horizon of any non-extremal Kerr\nblack hole.\n\n2\n\nCollisions near the event horizon r = r+\n\nIn this section, we consider two particles colliding outside a Kerr black hole\nand show that in any case, they cannot collide with arbitrarily high center\nof mass energies.

(13).\nOur purpose is to examine whether an infinite Eef f defined in Eq. (17)\nexists under the constraints (4),(11), (14). As physical requiremens, all the\nconstants E, L, etc. should be finite. Otherwise, infinite collision energies\ncan be produced even in Minkowski spacetime. It is also reasonable to\nassume that \u03b8\u0307 and \u03b8\u03072 are finite at the horizon. This is because one can\ndefine\n\u0012 \u0013b\n\u2202\na\n= \u03a3\u03b8\u0307\n(19)\nL\u03b8 \u2261 gab u\n\u2202\u03b8\nas the \"angular momentum with respect to \u03b8\". Note that unlike L, L\u03b8 is\nnot constant along geodesics. However, it is plausible to require that L\u03b8\nbe finite everywhere, particularly at the horizon. It then follows from Eq.\n(19) that \u03b8\u0307 is finite at the horizon.\nHence, it is easy to see from Eq. (17) that an infinite Eef f cannot be\nobtained unless \u2206 = 0, i.e., the collision must occur at the outer horizon\nr = r+ or the inner horizon r = r\u2212 . To check if Eef f could be infinite, we\nexpand E \u2032 at r = r+ and find\nE \u2032 = \u03b10 + \u03b11 (r \u2212 r+ ) + ... ,\n4\n\n(20)\n\n\fwhere\n\u03b10\n\n=\n+\n\nh\np\np\n8 \u2212a2 LL2 + E(\u22128 + 4a2 \u2212 8 1 \u2212 a2 )E2 + 2a(EL2 + E2 L)(1 + 1 \u2212 a2 )\n\uf8f9\nv\n!2 v\n!2\nu\nu\n\u221a\n\u221a\nu\n2\n2E(1 + 1 \u2212 a2 ) u\nt L \u2212 2E2 (1 + 1 \u2212 a ) \uf8fa .\n(21)\na2 t L \u2212\n\uf8fb\n2\na\na\n\nUsing Eq. (11), the square root terms can be simplified and one finds\n\u03b10 = 0 .\n\n(22)\n\nThe vanishing of \u03b10 is important because it rules out the divergence of\nEc.m. for generic angular momentums.\n\u221a Now it is obvious that Eef f cannot be infinite unless \u03b11 is infinite. Since\nS|r=r+ appears in the denominator of \u03b11 , an infinite \u03b11 requires\nS|r=r+ = 2a2 (L \u2212 Lc )2 = 0 .\n\n(23)\n\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 a2 )\n,\na\n\n(24)\n\nThus, if we choose\nL = Lc =\n\n2E(1 +\n\nEc.m. will become arbitrarily large at the horizon r = r+ . However, to make\nsure that the particle with this critical angular momentum can actually\nreach the horizon, Eq. (14) must hold outside the horizon.

The barrier outside the horizon\nis illustrated in Fig. 1.\nIn the above argument, we have chosen the minus sign in Eq. (12)\nfor both particles. The same choice was made by BSW. What if the\n\u221a two\nparticles take different signs? In that case, the plus sign in front of S in\nEq. (18) will become a minus sign and consequently \u03b10 in Eq. (20) will not\nvanish. Therefore, such two particles will collide with infinite energy even\nwithout a fine turning on angular momentum. But to make this happen,\none of the particles must be outgoing (\u1e59 > 0) on the horizon. For a nonextremal black hole, even holding a particle still at the horizon requires an\ninfinite local force [12]. Therefore, the configuration with \u1e59 > 0 should be\nruled out.\n\n3\n\nCollisions near the inner horizon r = r\u2212.\n\nNow we discuss the motions in the region r\u2212 < r < r+ . Due to the different\nnatures of the inner and outer horizons, some of the arguments in section\n2 will break down in this section. We shall highlight the differences.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 2, we consider two particles crossing the event\nhorizon of the right-hand universe and hitting each other at the Cauchy\nhorizon of the left-hand universe. The general equations (5)-(10) remain\nunchanged. However, Eq. (11) is derived from the fact that \u2207a t is a pastdirected timelike vector, which is no longer true outside the inner horizon.\nInstead, \u2207a r becomes past-directed in this region and any particle must\n\n6\n\n\fFigure 2: Penrose diagram for the Kerr spacetime in the region r\u2212 \u2264 r \u2264\nr+ . Two particles cross the event horizon and collide at the inner horizon.\nThe dashed lines refer to surfaces of constant r.\nfall in the direction of \u1e59 < 0, i.e.,\n1 \u221a\n\u1e59 = \u2212 \u221a\nS < 0.\n2 2\u03a3\n\n(30)\n\nIt should be noticed that Eq. (12) holds because we have chosen the ingoing\nmode for both particles in the region r > r+ , while Eq. (30) holds for any\nparticle in the region r\u2212 < r < r+ . Note that Eqs. (13)-(18) remain\nunchanged. Then we expand E \u2032 at r = r\u2212 . Corresponding to Eq. (20), we\nhave\nE \u2032 = \u03b10 + \u03b11 (r \u2212 r\u2212 ) + ...\n\n(31)\n\nwhere\n\u03b10\n\n=\n+\n\nh\np\np\n8 \u2212a2 LL2 + E(\u22128 + 4a2 + 8 1 \u2212 a2 )E2 + 2a(EL2 + E2 L)(1 \u2212 1 \u2212 a2 )\n\uf8f9\nv\n!2 v\n!2\nu\nu\n\u221a\n\u221a\nu\nu\n2\n2\n2E(1 \u2212 1 \u2212 a ) t\n2E2 (1 \u2212 1 \u2212 a ) \uf8fa\n(32)\na2 t L \u2212\nL2 \u2212\n\uf8fb.\na\na\n\nThis equation can be simplified by choosing the ingoing mode for both\nparticles, as depicted in Fig. 2. Here in the region r\u2212 < r < r+ , the\ningoing mode means \u1e6b < 0 (By the same argument as given at the end of\nsection 2, \u1e6b > 0 at the left-hand Cauchy horizon is not physically realizable).\nThen using the same argument which led to Eq. (11), we find\n!\n!\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2E2 (1 \u2212 1 \u2212 a2 )\n2E(1 \u2212 1 \u2212 a2 )\nL2 \u2212\n\u2265 0,\n(33)\nL\u2212\na\na\n7\n\n\fwhich leads to\n\u03b10 = 0 .\n\n(34)\n\nAgain, the necessary condition for Eef f blowing up at the horizon is\nthat \u03b11 blows up, which requires\nS|r=r\u2212 = 8a2 (L \u2212 L\u2032c )2 = 0 ,\n\n(35)\n\nwhere\nL\u2032c\n\n=\n\n2E(1 \u2212\n\n\u221a\na\n\n1 \u2212 a2 )\n\n.\n\n(36)\n\nTherefore, an infinite collision energy near the inner horizon requires that\none of the particles has the momentum\nL = L\u2032c\n\n(37)\n\nand the other particle has any different angular momentum. For the collision near the event horizon, we have shown that a potential barrier always\nexists. But the geodesic motions near the inner horizon are very different.\nWe shall show that there is no potential barrier in the vicinity of the inner\nhorizon. For our purposes, it is sufficient to consider the motions in the\nequatorial plane and let E = 1, in which case, S given in Eq. (13) reduces\nto\n\u221a\n\u221a\n16r[a4 \u2212 4(1 \u2212 1 \u2212 a2 )(r \u2212 2) + a2 (r2 + 2r + 4 1 \u2212 a2 \u2212 8)]\n.

Both functions are positive\nin the range r > r\u2212 .\nfall from infinity all the way to the Cauchy horizon. Fig. 5 plots \u1e6b(r) in\nthe region r > r\u2212 . We see that \u1e6b and \u1e6b2 are positive in the region r > r+ ,\nas expected. For r\u2212 < r < r+ , \u1e6b and \u1e6b2 are negative. This means both\nparticles must hit the left-hand Cauchy horizon, as depicted in Fig. 2.\nOtherwise, there will be a turning point \u1e6b = 0 in this region. It should\nalso be noticed that \u1e6b2 \u2192 \u2212\u221e, meaning that this particle will cross the\nCauchy horizon. But for the first particle which has a critical angular\nmomentum, \u1e6b is finite as r \u2192 r\u2212 . Thus, instead of crossing the Cauchy\nhorizon, this particle spirals asymptotically onto the horizon. This is the\nnecessary mechanism for an infinite center of mass energy as pointed out\nin [8]. One can also check that \u1e59 vanishes on the Cauchy horizon while \u1e592\ndoes not, which is consistent with the behaviors of \u1e6b and \u1e6b2 .\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have provided a rigorous proof showing that the center of mass energy\ncannot be divergent at the event horizon of a non-extremal black hole. This\n\n9\n\n\fFigure 5: Plots of \u1e6b(r) and \u1e6b2 (r).\nproof is general and exhausts all of the possibilities. The motion of particles\nis not confined to the equatorial plane and the particles may be released\nfrom any point outside the black hole. We find that a critical angular\nmomentum is required for the divergence of Ec.m. at the horizon. However,\nwith this angular momentum, the particle can never reach the horizon. In\nrelation to Lake's work, we first prove that no divergence of energy occur\nat the inner horizon for particles with generic angular momentums. A\ncritical angular momentum is required for the divergence. We show with\nan explicit example that two particles can fall from infinity all the way\nto the inner horizon and collide with an arbitrarily high center of mass\nenergy. We have shown that such arbitrarily high energies can be obtained\nin any non-extremal Kerr spacetime, unlike the case in [1] that requires the\nblack hole to be exactly extremal. Since extremal black holes do not exist\nin nature, the ultraenergetic collisions near Cauchy horizons may be more\npractical and realizable.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was supported by NSFC grants 10605006, 10975016 and\nby\"the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities\".\n\nReferences\n[1] M.Ba\u00f1ados, J.Silk and S.M.West, Phys.Rev.Lett. 103, 111102 (2009).\n[2] O.B.Zaslavskii, Phys.
