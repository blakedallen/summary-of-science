The problem of unital evaluation\nStudent resistance to the evaluation of .999 . . . as the real number 1\n(henceforth referred to as the unital evaluation) has been widely discussed in the mathematics education literature. It has been suggested\nthat the source of such resistance lies in a psychological predisposition\nin favor of thinking of .999 . . . as a process, or iterated procedure, rather\nthan the final outcome, see for instance D. Tall's papers [28, p. 6], [25,\np. 221], [23] (see also [27] for another approach).\nWe propose an alternative model to explain such resistance, in the\nframework of non-standard analysis. From this point of view, the resistance is directed against an unspoken and unacknowledged application\nof the standard part function \"st\" (see Section 11, item 11.3), namely\nthe stripping away of a ghost of an infinitesimal, to echo George Berkeley [3], implicit in unital evaluation:\n\uf8eb\n\nst \uf8ed\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8 = 1.\nFigure 1.1. Taking standard part of wikiartist's conception of an infinity of 9s\n\n\fA STRICT NON-STANDARD INEQUALITY .999 . . . < 1\n\n3\n\nWhat is the significance of such fine (indeed, infinitesimal) districtions between .999 . . . and 1? As this text is addressed to a wide\naudience, it may be worth recalling that dividing by the difference\n1 \u2212 .999 . . . will only be possible if the latter is nonzero, a matter of immediate import for studying rates of change and calculating derivatives\n(see Section 7).\nThe hyperreal approach to a certain extent vindicates the student\nresistance to education professionals' toeing the standard line on unital\nevaluation: so long as the number system has not been specified, the\nstudents' hunch that .999 . . . can fall infinitesimally short of 1, can be\njustified in a mathematically rigorous fashion.\nIn Section 2, based on a formula for a geometric sum, we summarize\nthe standard argument in favor of unital evaluation. In Section 3,\nwe summarize the standard resistance to the latter. In Section 4, we\nconstruct a hyperreal decimal in [0, 1), represented by a string of Hinfinitely many repeated 9s, and identify its Lightstone representation.\nIn Section 5, we square the strict inequality with standard reality, by\nmeans of the standard part function. In Section 6, we represent the\nhyperreal graphically by means of an infinite-magnification microscope,\nalready exploited for pedagogical purposes by Keisler [15] and Tall [23].\nIn Section 7, we exploit the hyperreal to calculate f \u2032 (1).\nIn Section 8, we develop an applied-mathematical model of a hypercalculator so as to explain a familiar phenomenon of a calculator\nreturning a string of 9s in place of an integer. In Section 9, we examine\nthe cognitive concept of generic limit of Cornu and Tall in mathematics\neducation, in relation to a hyperreal approach to limits. In Section 10,\nwe set the situation in perspective, with E. A. Abbott.\nSection 11 is a technical appendix containing basic material on nonstandard calculus. The historical Section 12 contains an examination\nof the views of Courant, Lakatos, and E. Bishop. Section 13 contains\na 10-step proposal concerning the problem of unital evaluation.\n2.

Arguing by \"I told you so\"\nWhen I tried this one on my teenage daughter, she remained unconvinced. She felt that the number .999 . . . is smaller than 1. After all,\njust look at it! There is something missing before you reach 1. I then\nproceeded to give a number of arguments. Apologetic mumbo-jumbo\nabout the alleged \"non-unicity of decimal representation\" fell on deaf\nears. The one that seemed to work best was the following variety of\nthe old-fashioned \"because I told you so\" argument: factor out a 3:\n3(.333 . . .) = 1\nto obtain\n\n1\n(3.1)\n3\nand \"everybody knows\" that the number .333 . . . is exactly \"a third\" on\nthe nose. Q.E.D. This worked for a few minutes, but then the validity\nof (3.1) was called into question, as well.\n.333 . . . =\n\n4. Coming clean\nThen I finally broke down. In Abraham Robinson's theory of hyperreal analysis [20], there is a notion of an infinite hyperinteger (see\nSection 11, item 11.8). H. Jerome Keisler [15] took to denoting such\nan entity by the symbol\nH,\n\n\fA STRICT NON-STANDARD INEQUALITY .999 . . . < 1\n\n5\n\npossibly because its inverse is an infinitesimal h typically appearing in\nthe denominator of the familiar definition of derivative (it most decidedly does not stand for \"Howard\"). Taking infinitely many terms in\nformula (2.1) is interpreted as replacing n \u2208 N by an infinite hyperinteger\nH \u2208 N\u2217 \\ N.\n\nThe transfer principle (see Section 11, item 11.1) applied to (2.1) then\nyields\n1\n.999\n| {z. .}. = 1 \u2212 10H\nH\n\nwhere the infinitesimal quantity\n\n1\n10H\n\nis nonzero:\n\n1\n> 0.\n10H\nTherefore we obtain the strict nonstandard inequality\n.999\n| {z. .}. < 1\n\n(4.1)\n\nH\n\nand my teenager was right all along. Note that hyperreal extended\ndecimal expansions were treated by A. Lightstone in [17, pp. 245\u2013247].\nIn his notation, the hyperreal appearing in the left-hand-side of (4.1)\nappears as the extended decimal\n.999 . . . ; . . . 999\u0302\nwith the hat \"\u02c6\" indicating the H-th decimal place, where the last\nrepeated digit 9 occurs. We have employed the underbrace notation as\nin (4.1) rather than Lightstone's semicolon, as it parallels the finite case\nmore closely, and seems more intuitive. An alternative construction of\na strict inequality .999 . . . < 1 may be found in [18], however in a\nnumber system which is not a field.\n5. Squaring .999 . . . < 1 with reality\nTo obtain a real number in place of the hyperreal .999\n| {z. .}., we apply\nH\n\nthe standard part function \"st\" (see Section 11, item 11.3):\n!\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\nst .999\n| {z. .}. = st 1 \u2212 10H = 1 \u2212 st 10H = 1.\nH\n\nTo elaborate further, one could make the following remark. Even in\nstandard analysis, the expression .999 . . . is only shorthand for the\n\n\f6\n\nKARIN USADI KATZ AND M. KATZ\n\nlimit of the finite expression (2.1) when the standard integer n increases without bound. From the hyperreal viewpoint, \"taking the\nlimit\" is accomplished in two steps:\n(1) evaluating the expression at an infinite hyperinteger H, and\nthen\n(2) taking the standard part.\nThe two steps form the non-standard definition of limit (see Section 11, item 11.10). Now the first step (evaluating at H) produces\na hyperreal number dependent on H (in all cases it will be strictly\nless than 1). The second step will strip away the infinitesimal part\nand produce the standard real number 1 in the cluster (see Section 11,\nitem 11.4) of points infinitely close to it.\nRemark 5.1 (Multiple infinities). The existence of more than one infinite hyperreal is not only a requirement to have a field, but is actually\nextremely useful. For example, using the natural hypperreal extension f \u2217 of f (see Section 11, item 11.1), it is possible to write down a\npointwise definition of uniform continuity of a function f (see below).\nSuch a definition considerably reduces the quantifier complexity of the\nstandard definition.\nTo elaborate, note that the standard definition of uniform continuity of a real function f can be said to be global rather than local (i.e.\npointwise), in the sense that, unlike ordinary continuity, uniform continuity cannot be defined as a pointwise property of f . Meanwhile,\nin the framework of Robinson's theory, it is possible to give a definition of uniform continuity of the real function f in terms of its natural\nhyperreal extension, denoted\nf \u2217,\nin such a way that the definition is local, in the sense of depending\nonly on each pointwise cluster (see Section 11, item 11.4) in the domain\nof f \u2217 . Thus, f is uniformly continuous on R if the following condition\nis satisfied:\n\u2200x \u2208 R\u2217\n\n\u0001\ny \u2248 x =\u21d2 f \u2217 (y) \u2248 f \u2217 (x) .\n\nHere \u2248 stands for the relation of being infinitely close. The condition\nmust be satisfied at the infinite hyperreals x, in addition to the finite ones. This addition is what distinguishes uniform continuity from\nordinary continuity.\n\n\fA STRICT NON-STANDARD INEQUALITY .999 . . . < 1\n\n7\n\nFigure 6.1. Three infinitely close hyperreals under a microscope\n6.

Zooming in on the slope of tangent line to\nthe curve y = x2 at x = 1\nin place of the expected 1.000000. For instance, a calculator programmed to apply Newton's method to find the zero of a function,\nmay return the .999999 value as the unique zero of the function\nlog x.\nDeveloping a model to account for such a phenomenon is complicated\nby the variety of the degree of precision displayed, as well as the greater\nprecision typically available internally than that displayed on the LCD.\nTo simplify matters, we will consider an idealized model, called a hypercalculator, of a theoretical calculator that applies Newton's method\nprecisely H times, where H is a fixed infinite hyperinteger, as discussed\nin the previous section.\nTheorem 8.1. Let f be a concave increasing differentiable function\nwith domain an open interval (1 \u2212 \u01eb, 1 + \u01eb) and vanishing at its midpoint. Then the hypercalculator applied to f will return a hyperreal decimal .999 . . . with an initial segment consisting of an unbounded number\nof repeated 9's.\nProof. Assume for simplicity that f (x0 ) < 0. We have\nx1 = x0 +\n\n|f (x0 )|\n.\nf \u2032 (x0 )\n\n\f10\n\nKARIN USADI KATZ AND M. KATZ\n\nBy the mean value theorem, there is a point c such that x0 < c < 1\n(x0 )|\n, or\nwhere f \u2032 (c) = |f1\u2212x\n0\n|f (x0 )|\n= 1 \u2212 x0 .\nf \u2032 (c)\nSince f is concave, its derivative f \u2032 is decreasing, hence\nx1 = x0 +\n\n|f (x0 )|\n< x0 + 1 \u2212 x0 = 1.\nf \u2032 (x0 )\n\nn )|\nThus x1 < 1. Inductively, the point xn+1 = xn + |ff \u2032(x\nsatisfies xn < 1\n(xn )\nfor all n. By the transfer principle (see Section 11, item 11.1), the\nhyperreal xH satisfies a strict inequality\n\nxH < 1,\nas well (cf. (4.1)). Hence the hypercalculator returns a value strictly\nsmaller than 1 yet infinitely close to 1, proving the theorem.\n\u0003\n9. Generic limit and precise meaning of infinity\nThe precise meaning of the finite expression\n.999...9,\n\nn times\n\nis that the repeated digit 9 occurs precisely n times. The standard\nnon-terminating decimal\n.999 . . . ,\nas it is traditionally written, is said to have an unbounded number of\nrepeated digits 9, but the expression \"infinitely many 9's\" is only a\nfigure of speech, as \"infinity\" is not a number in standard analysis, in\nthe sense that, whenever a precise meaning is attributed to the phrase\n\"infinitely many 9's\", it is almost invariably in terms of limits. D. Tall\nwrites in [26] as follows:\n[...] the infinite decimal 0.999 . . . is intended to signal\nthe limit of the sequence 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, ... which is 1,\nbut in practice it is ofter imagined as a limiting process\nwhich never quite reaches 1.\nTall [24, 26] describes a concept in cognitive theory he calls a generic\nlimit concept in the following terms:\n[...] if a quantity repeatedly gets smaller and smaller\nand smaller without ever being zero, then the limiting\nobject is naturally conceptualised as an extremely small\n\n\fA STRICT NON-STANDARD INEQUALITY .999 . . . < 1\n\n11\n\nquantity that is not zero (Cornu [7]). Infinitesimal quantities are natural products of the human imagination derived through combining potentially infinite repetition\nand the recognition of its repeating properties.\n(see [11] for the related notion of procept). A technical realisation of the\ncognitive concept of generic limit is achieved in the hyperreal line (see\nSection 11, item 11.2) as follows. Given an infinite hyperinteger H, consider the hyperreal repeated decimal where the repeated digit 9 occurs\nprecisely H times, in the sense routinely used in non-standard calculus, for example, when one partitions a compact interval into H parts\nin the proof of the extreme value theorem (see Section 11, item 11.9).\nSuch a number can be denoted suggestively by .999\n| {z. .}. with an underH\n\nbrace indicating that the digit 9 occurs H times, resulting in a strict\ninequality .999\n| {z. .}. < 1 (with the underbrace indicating that we are not\nH\n\nreferring to the standard real). In Lightstone's notation, this hyperreal\nwould be expressed by the hyperdecimal\n.999...; ...9,\n\nthe last digit 9 occurring in the H-th position. Such a hyperreal appears\nto be the mathematical counterpart of the cognitive concept of generic\nlimit.\n10. Limits, generic limits, and Flatland\nAs far as standard limits are concerned, given the sequence u1 = .9,\nu2 = .99, u3 = .999, etc., from the hyperreal viewpoint we have\nlim un = st(uH ),\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nwhere \"st\" is the standard part function which \"strips away\" the infinitesimal part, and outputs the standard real in the cluster of the\nhyperreal uH (see Section 11, item 11.4). What may be bothering\nthe students is this unacknowledged application of the standard part\nfunction, resulting in a loss of an infinitesimal.\nWe have, in fact, been looking at the problem \"from above\", in\nthe context of non-standard analysis. Perhaps a helpful parallel is\nprovided by the famous animated film Flatland (cf. [1]), where the two\u2013\ndimensional creatures are unable to conceive of what we think of as the\nsphere in 3-space, due to their dimension limitation. Similarly, one can\nconceive of the difficulty in the understanding of the unital evaluation\nof .999 . . ., as due to the limitation of the standard real vision.\n\n\f12\n\nKARIN USADI KATZ AND M. KATZ\n\nThe notion of an infinitesimal appeals to intuition (see R. Courant's\ncomment in Section 12) and would not go away inspite of what is, by\nnow, over a century of (\u01eb, \u03b4)-ideology (see E. Bishop's comment in Section 12). Highschool students are exposed to the thorny .999 . . . issue\nbefore they are exposed to any rigorous notion of a real number. They\nare not aware of fine differences between rational numbers, algebraic\nnumbers, real numbers, hyperreal numbers. A related point is make by\nKeisler in his textbook [15], when he points out that \"we have no way\nof knowing what the line in physical space looks like\". Most students\n(perhaps all) initially believe that the mysterious number with \"infinitely many\" repeated digits 9 falls short of the value 1. If an education\nprofessional claims that the students are making a mistake, might he\nin fact be making a pedagogical error?\n11. A non-standard glossary\nIn this section we present some illustrative terms and facts from nonstandard calculus [15]. The relation of being infinitely close is denoted\nby the symbol \u2248. Thus, x \u2248 y if and only if x \u2212 y is infinitesimal.\n\n11.1. Natural hyperreal extension f \u2217 . The extension principle of\nnon-standard calculus states that every real function f has a hyperreal\nextension, denoted f \u2217 and called the natural extension of f . The transfer principle of non-standard calculus asserts that every real statement\ntrue for f , is true also for f \u2217 . For example, if f (x) > 0 for every\nreal x in its domain I, then f \u2217 (x) > 0 for every hyperreal x in its domain I \u2217 . Note that if the interval I is unbounded, then I \u2217 necessarily\ncontains infinite hyperreals. We will typically drop the star \u2217 so as not\nto overburden the notation.\n11.2. Internal set. Internal set is the key tool in formulating the\ntransfer principle, which concerns the logical relation between the properties of the real numbers R, and the properties of a larger field denoted\nR\u2217\ncalled the hyperreal line. The field R\u2217 includes, in particular, infinitesimal (\"infinitely small\") numbers, providing a rigorous mathematical\nrealisation of a project initiated by Leibniz. Roughly speaking, the\nidea is to express analysis over R in a suitable language of mathematical logic, and then point out that this language applies equally well\nto R\u2217 . This turns out to be possible because at the set-theoretic level,\nthe propositions in such a language are interpreted to apply only to\ninternal sets rather than to all sets. Note that the term \"language\"\nis used in a loose sense in the above. A more precise term is theory\n\n\fA STRICT NON-STANDARD INEQUALITY .999 . . . < 1\n\n13\n\nin first-order logic. Internal sets include natural extension of standard\nsets.\n11.3. Standard part function. The standard part function \"st\" is\nthe key ingredient in Abraham Robinson's resolution of the paradox of\nLeibniz's definition of the derivative as the ratio of two infinitesimals\ndy\n.\ndx\nThe standard part function associates to a finite hyperreal number x,\nthe standard real x0 infinitely close to it, so that we can write\nst(x) = x0 .\nIn other words, \"st\" strips away the infinitesimal part to produce the\nstandard real in the cluster. The standard part function \"st\" is not\ndefined by an internal set (see item 11.2 above) in Robinson's theory.\n11.4. Cluster. Each standard real is accompanied by a cluster of hyperreals infinitely close to it. The standard part function collapses the\nentire cluster back to the standard real contained in it. The cluster\nof the real number 0 consists precisely of all the infinitesimals. Every\ninfinite hyperreal decomposes as a triple sum\nH + r + \u01eb,\nwhere H is a hyperinteger, r is a real number in [0, 1), and \u01eb is infinitesimal. Varying \u01eb over all infinitesimals, one obtains the cluster\nof H + r.\n11.5. Derivative. To define the real derivative of a real function f in\nthis approach, one no longer needs an infinite limiting process as in\nstandard calculus. Instead, one sets\n\u0012\n\u0013\nf (x + \u01eb) \u2212 f (x)\n\u2032\nf (x) = st\n,\n(11.1)\n\u01eb\n\nwhere \u01eb is infinitesimal, yielding the standard real number in the cluster\nof the hyperreal argument of \"st\" (the derivative exists if and only\nif the value (11.1) is independent of the choice of the infinitesimal).\nThe addition of \"st\" to the formula resolves the centuries-old paradox\nfamously criticized by George Berkeley [3] (in terms of the Ghosts of\ndeparted quantities, cf. [21, Chapter 6]), and provides a rigorous basis\nfor the calculus.\n11.6. Continuity. A function f is continuous at x if the following\ncondition is satisfied: y \u2248 x implies f (y) \u2248 f (x).\n\n\f14\n\nKARIN USADI KATZ AND M. KATZ\n\n11.7. Uniform continuity. A function f is uniformly continuous on I\nif the following condition is satisfied:\n\u2022 standard: for every \u01eb > 0 there exists a \u03b4 > 0 such that for\nall x \u2208 I and for all y \u2208 I, if |x \u2212 y| < \u03b4 then |f (x) \u2212 f (y)| < \u01eb.\n\u2022 non-standard: for all x \u2208 I \u2217 , if x \u2248 y then f (x) \u2248 f (y).\nSee Remark 5.1 for a more detailed discussion.\n11.8. Hyperinteger. A hyperreal number H equal to its own integer\npart\nH = [H]\nis called a hyperinteger (here the integer part function is the natural\nextension of the real one). The elements of the complement Z\u2217 \\ Z are\ncalled infinite hyperintegers.\n11.9. Proof of extreme value theorem. Let H be an infinite hyperinteger. The interval [0, 1] has a natural hyperreal extension. Consider its partition into H subintervals of equal length H1 , with partition\npoints xi = i/H as i runs from 0 to H. Note that in the standard\nsetting, with n in place of H, a point with the maximal value of f\ncan always be chosen among the n + 1 partition points xi , by induction. Hence, by the transfer principle, there is a hyperinteger i0 such\nthat 0 \u2264 i0 \u2264 H and\nf (xi0 ) \u2265 f (xi ) \u2200i = 0, ..., H.\n\n(11.2)\n\nConsider the real point\n\nc = st(xi0 ).\nAn arbitrary real point x lies in a suitable sub-interval of the partition,\nnamely x \u2208 [xi\u22121 , xi ], so that st(xi ) = x. Applying \"st\" to the inequality (11.2), we obtain by continuity of f that f (c) \u2265 f (x), for all real x,\nproving c to be a maximum of f (see [15, p. 164]).\n11.10. Limit. We have limx\u2192a f (x) = L if and only if whenever the\ndifference x \u2212 a is infinitesimal, the difference f (x) \u2212 L is infinitesimal,\nas well, or in formulas: if st(x) = a then st(f (x)) = L.\nGiven a sequence of real numbers {xn |n \u2208 N}, if L \u2208 R we say L\nis the limit of the sequence and write L = limn\u2192\u221e xn if the following\ncondition is satisfied:\nst(xH ) = L for all infinite H\n\n(11.3)\n\n(here the extension principle is used to define xn for every infinite value\nof the index). This definition has no quantifier alternations. The standard (\u01eb, \u03b4)-definition of limit, on the other hand, does have quantifier\n\n\fA STRICT NON-STANDARD INEQUALITY .999 . . . < 1\n\n15\n\nalternations:\nL = lim xn \u21d0\u21d2 \u2200\u01eb > 0 , \u2203N \u2208 N , \u2200n \u2208 N : n > N =\u21d2 d(xn , L) < \u01eb.\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n(11.4)\n\n11.11. Non-terminating decimals. Given a real decimal\nu = .d1 d2 d3 . . . ,\nconsider the sequence u1 = .d1 , u2 = .d1 d2 , u3 = .d1 d2 d3 , etc. Then\nby definition,\nu = lim un = st(uH )\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nfor every infinite H. Now if u is a non-terminating decimal, then one\nobtains a strict inequality uH < u by transfer from un < u. In particular,\n1\n(11.5)\n.999 . . . ; . . . 9\u0302 = .999\n| {z. .}. = 1 \u2212 10H < 1,\nH\n\nwhere the hat \u02c6 indicates the H-th Lightstone decimal place. The\nstandard interpretation of the symbol .999 . . . as 1 is necessitated by\nnotational uniformity: the symbol .a1 a2 a3 . . . in every case corresponds\nto the limit of the sequence of terminating decimals .a1 . . . an . Alternatively, the ellipsis in .999 . . . could be interpreted as alluding to an\ninfinity of nonzero digits specified by a choice of an infinite hyperinteger H \u2208 N\u2217 \\ N. The resulting H-infinite extended decimal string of 9s\ncorresponds to an infinitesimally diminished hyperreal value (11.5).\nSuch an interpretation is perhaps more in line with the naive initial\nintuition persistently reported by teachers.\n12. Courant, Lakatos, and Bishop\n\nPrior to Robinson, mathematicians thought of infinitesimals in terms\nof \"naive befogging\" and \"vague mystical ideas\". Thus, Richard Courant\n[8, p. 81] wrote as follows:\nWe must, however, guard ourselves against thinking of dx\nas an \"infinitely small quantity\" or \"infinitesimal\", or\nof the integral as the \"sum of an infinite number of infinitesimally small quantities\". Such a conception would\nbe devoid of any clear meaning; it is only a naive befogging of what we have previously carried out with precision.\nand again on page 101:\n\n\f16\n\nKARIN USADI KATZ AND M. KATZ\n\nWe have no right to suppose that first \u2206x goes through\nsomething like a limiting process and reaches a value\nwhich is infinitesimally small but still not 0, so that \u2206x\nand \u2206y are replaced by \"infinitely small quantities\" or\n\"infinitesimals\" dx and dy, and that the quotient of\nthese quantities is then formed. Such a conception of\nthe derivative is incompatible with the clarity of ideas\ndemanded in mathematics; in fact, it is entirely meaningless. For a great many simple-minded people it undoubtedly has a certain charm, the charm of mystery\nwhich is always associated with the word \"infinite\"; and\nin the early days of the differential calculus even Leibnitz [sic] himself was capable of combining these vague\nmystical ideas with a thoroughly clear understanding of\nthe limiting process. It is true that this fog which hung\nround the foundations of the new science did not prevent Leibnitz [sic] or his great successors from finding\nthe right path. But this does not release us from the\nduty of avoiding every such hazy idea [emphasis\nadded\u2013MK] in our building-up of the differential and\nintegral calculus.\nNeedless to say, Courant's criticism was not without merit at the time of\nits writing (a quarter century prior to Robinson's discovery). I. Lakatos\n[16, p. 44] wrote in '66 as follows:\nRobinson's work... offers a rational reconstruction of\nthe discredited infinitesimal theory which satisfies modern requirements of rigour and which is no weaker than\nWeierstrass's theory. This reconstruction makes infinitesimal theory an almost respectable ancestor of a fully\nfledged, powerful modern theory, lifts it from the status of pre-scientific gibberish, and renews interest in its\npartly forgotten, partly falsified history.\nNot everyone was persuaded. A decade later, Courant's duty of avoiding every such hazy idea was taken up under a constructivist banner\nby E. Bishop. In his essay [5] cast in the form of an imaginary dialog between Brouwer and Hilbert, E. Bishop anchors his foundational\nstance in a species of mathematical constructivism. Thus, Bishop's opposition to Robinson's infinitesimals, expressed in a bristling review [6]\nof Keisler's textbook [15], was to be expected (and in fact was anticipated by editor Halmos). In a memorable parenthetical remark, Bishop\nwrites [6]:\n\n\fA STRICT NON-STANDARD INEQUALITY .999 . . . < 1\n\n17\n\nAlthough it seems to be futile, I always tell my calculus\nstudents that mathematics is not esoteric: It is common\nsense. (Even the notorious (\u01eb, \u03b4)-definition of limit is\ncommon sense [emphasis added\u2013MK], and moreover\nit is central to the important practical problems of approximation and estimation.)\nBishop is referring, of course, to the type of common-sense definition\nreproduced in (11.4), which he favors over Keisler's definition (11.3) in\nterms of Robinson's hyperreals.\nBishop expressed his views about non-standard analysis and its use\nin teaching in a brief paragraph toward the end of his essay \"Crisis in\ncontemporary mathematics\" [5, p. 513-514]. After discussing Hilbert's\nformalist program he writes:\nA more recent attempt at mathematics by formal finesse\nis non-standard analysis. I gather that it has met with\nsome degree of success, whether at the expense of giving significantly less meaningful proofs I do not know.\nMy interest in non-standard analysis is that attempts\nare being made to introduce it into calculus courses. It\nis difficult to believe that debasement of meaning\n[emphasis added\u2013MK] could be carried so far.\nBishop's view of the introduction of non-standard analysis in the classroom as no less than a \"debasement of meaning\", was duly noted by\nJ. Dauben [9].\nTo illlustrate how Bishop anchors his foundational stance in a species\nof mathematical constructivism, note that in [5, pp. 507-508], he writes:\nTo my mind, it is a major defect of our profession that\nwe refuse to distinguish [...] between integers that are\ncomputable and those that are not [...] the distinction\nbetween computable and non-computable, or constructive and non-constructive is the source of the most famous disputes in the philosophy of mathematics...\nOn page 511, Bishop defines a principle (LPO) as the statement that\nit is possible to search \"a sequence of integers to see\nwhether they all vanish\",\nand goes on to characterize the dependence on the LPO as a procedure\nboth Brouwer and Bishop himself reject. S. Feferman [10] explains the\nprinciple as follows:\nBishop criticized both non-constructive classical mathematics and intuitionism. He called non-constructive\n\n\f18\n\nKARIN USADI KATZ AND M. KATZ\n\nmathematics \"a scandal\", particularly because of its\n\"deficiency in numerical meaning\". What he simply\nmeant was that if you say something exists you ought to\nbe able to produce it, and if you say there is a function\nwhich does something on the natural numbers then you\nought to be able to produce a machine which calculates\nit out at each number.\nThe constructivist objections to LPO are similar to objections to the\nlaw of excluded middle, and to proofs by contradiction\n(for example,\n\u221a\nthe traditional argument for the irrationality of 2 is a proof by contradiction, but using classical continued fraction estimates, it is easy\nto rewrite it in a numerically meaningful fashion, acceptable from the\nconstructivist viewpoint).\nGiven that a typical construction of Robinson's infinitesimals (see\nKeisler [15, p. 911]) certainly does rely on LPO, Bishop's opposition\nto such infinitesimals, expressed in a bristling review [6] of Keisler's\ntextbook, was to be expected.\nNon-standard calculus in the classroom was analyzed in the Chicago\nstudy by K. Sullivan [22]. Sullivan showed that students following the\nnon-standard calculus course were better able to interpret the sense of\nthe mathematical formalism of calculus than a control group following\na standard syllabus. Such a conclusion was also noted by M. Artigue [2,\np. 172].\n13. A 10-step proposal\nIn the matter of teaching decimal notation, we would like to obtain\nsome reaction from educators to the following proposal concerning the\nproblem of the unital evaluation of .999 . . .. A student may ask:\nWhat does the teacher mean to happen exactly after\nnine, nine, nine when he writes dot, dot, dot?\nHow is a teacher to handle such a question? Experience shows that\ntoeing the standard line on the unital evaluation of .999 . . . possesses\na high-frustration factor in the classroom. Rather than baffling the\nstudent with such a categorical claim, a teacher could proceed by presenting the following ten points, based on the material outlined in\nSection 11:\n(1) the reals are not, as the rationals are not, the maximal number\nsystem;\n(2) there exist larger number systems, containing infinitesimals;\n(3) in such larger systems, the interval [0, 1] contains many numbers\ninfinitely close to 1;\n\n\fA STRICT NON-STANDARD INEQUALITY .999 . . . < 1\n\n19\n\n(4) in a particular larger system called the hyperreal numbers, there\nis a generalized notion of decimal expansion for such numbers,\nstarting in each case with an unbounded number of digits \"9\";\n(5) all such numbers therefore have an arguable claim to the notation \".999 . . .\" which is patently ambiguous (the meaning of\nthe ellipsis \". . .\" requires disambiguation);\n(6) all but one of them are strictly smaller than 1;\n(7) the convention adopted by most professional mathematicians\nis to interpret the symbol \".999 . . .\" as referring to the largest\nsuch number, namely 1 itself;\n(8) thus, the students' intuition that .999 . . . falls just short of 1\ncan be justified in a mathematically rigorous fashion;\n(9) the said extended number system is mostly relevant in infinitesimal calculus (also known as differential and integral calculus);\n(10) if you would like to learn more about the hyperreals, go to your\nteacher so he can give you further references.\n14. Epilogue\nA goal of our, admittedly non-standard, analysis is both to educate and to heal. The latter part involves placing balm upon the bewilderment of myriad students of decimal notation, frustrated by the\nreluctance of their education professionals to yield as much as an infinitesimal iota in their evaluation of the symbol .999..., or to acknowledge\nthe ambiguity of an ellipsis.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to David Ebin and David Tall for a careful reading of\nan earlier version of the manuscript, and for making numerous helpful\nsuggestions.\nReferences\n[1] Abbott, Edwin A.: The annotated Flatland.
