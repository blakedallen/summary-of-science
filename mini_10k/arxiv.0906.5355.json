INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) is an experiment designed to explore systematically the optical transient and variable sky. The main goal of this project is\nto fill the gaps in our present-day knowledge of the optical transient phase space (Figure 1). Besides reasonably well-studied populations (e.g., classical novae, supernovae), there exist many types of either poorly constrained events (e.g., luminous red novae, tidal disruption\nflares) or predicted but not yet discovered phenomena\n(e.g., orphan afterglows of \u03b3-ray bursts). Here, dedicated\nwide-field instruments have the best prospect of leading\nto significant progress.\nA number of surveys (summarized in Table 1) have attempted this challenging task and have provided important contributions to our understanding of time-domain\nscience. The majority of these projects, however, have\nbeen designed (especially in terms of cadence) to maximize the discovery probability for selected source populations (typically microlensing, classical novae, or supernovae). Thus, large areas of the phase space remain\npoorly explored at best and are ripe for investigation\nElectronic address: arne@astro.caltech.edu\n\nwith PTF.\nThe aim of this paper is to present the scientific goals of\nPTF and to provide predictions for discoveries during the\nfirst four years of operation. In order to give the reader\nan overview of the project, we start by summarizing the\nimportant instrumental aspects of PTF and the general\nsurvey strategy. Much more detailed discussion of the\nPTF system, both hardware and software, can be found\nin a separate publication (Law et al. 2009).\n2. PROJECT OVERVIEW\n2.1. Instrument\nPTF uses the CFH12K mosaic camera (formerly at\nthe Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope) mounted on the\nSamuel Oschin 48-inch telescope (P48) at Palomar Observatory, California. The camera consists of two rows\nof six 2k\u00d74k CCDs each, providing a 7.9 deg2 field\nof view (FoV) with a plate scale of 1.0\u2032\u2032 pixel\u22121 ; see\n(Rahmer et al. 2008) for more details o the camera. Observations will be performed mainly in one of two broadband filters (Mould-R, sdss-g), but additional narrowband filters (H\u03b1, H\u03b1off ) can be employed at the telescope. Under typical seeing conditions (1.1\u2032\u2032 at Palomar)\nthe camera achieves a full width at half-maximum in-\n\n\f2\n\nA.

Filled boxes\nmark well-studied classes with a large number of known members\n(classical novae, Type Ia supernovae [SNe Ia], core-collapse supernovae [CCSNe], luminous blue variables [LBVs]). Vertically\nhatched boxes show classes for which only few (<\n\u223c 4) candidate\nmembers have been suggested so far (luminous red novae, tidal disruption flares, luminous supernovae). Horizontally hatched boxes\nare classes which are believed to exist, but have not yet been detected (orphan afterglows of short- and long GRBs). The positions\nof theoretically predicted events (fall-back supernovae, macronovae, .Ia supernovae [.Ia]) are indicated by empty boxes. See text\nfor references related to each science case. The brightest transients\n(on-axis afterglows of GRBs) and events detectable predominantly\nin the Milky Way (e.g., dwarf novae) are omitted for clarity (see\nTable 4 for a more complete list).

Observing Strategy\nThe first few months after first light in December 13th\n2008 have been used for commissioning of the instrument and software. Initial observations were taken to\nconstruct a fiducial reference image of the sky for later\nuse in transient detection.\nFollowing commissioning, PTF will be operating on\n80% (\u223c 290 night yr\u22121 ) of the P48 nights until at least\nthe end of 2012. During this time several predefined longterm surveys and a number of evolving experiments will\nbe performed. The primary experiments are the 5 day\ncadence survey (5DC), the dynamic cadence experiment\n(DyC), a monitoring of the Orion star-forming region\n(see \u00a7 3.10), and a narrow-band all-sky survey. The respective time allocations, cadences, and photometric filters are summarized in Table 2.\nTABLE 2\nSummary of Main PTF Experiments\nExperiment Exposure Cadences Filter\n% of total\n5DC\n41\n5d\nR\nDyC\n40\n1 min \u2013 3 d g, R\nOrion\n11\n1 min\nR\nFull Moon\n8\n\u2013\nH\u03b1\n\nThe 5DC experiment will at any given time monitor\nan active area of \u223c 2700 deg2 with a mean cadence of\n5 d.

The smallest\nangular size is determined by the pixel size (filled circle). Binning is expected to improve sensitivity in proportion to the square\nroot of the number of pixels. The proposed survey will have better sensitivity by more than two orders of magnitude over previous surveys (e.g., SHASSA; Gaustad et al. 2001, VTSS; Dennison\net al. 1998). The only survey with superior sensitivity (IPHAS;\nWalton et al. 2004) is limited to the Galactic plane (|b| < 5\u25e6 )\n\nThe DyC experiment is designed to explore transient\nphenomena on time scales shorter than 5 d and longer\nthan about 1 min. Here, several different g- and/or\nR-band surveys will be conducted during the first six\nmonths of operation. Strategies for subsequent DyC observations will be decided after the initial results have\nbeen analyzed.\nDuring bright time 3\u03c0 sr narrow-band (H\u03b1, H\u03b1off ,\n[O III]) surveys will be conducted. Here, \u223c 4000 tiles covering the sky at \u03b4J2000 > \u221228 \u25e6 will be observed at least\ntwice in each filter. The estimated 5\u03c3 point source flux\nlimit for the H\u03b1 survey will be \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u221217 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121\n(\u223c 0.6 Rayleigh). Better sensitivity by a factor of \u223c60\ncan be achieved by binning the H\u03b1 images to a resolution of 1\u2032 . This sensitivity will constitute an improvement over that of previous surveys by a factor of \u223c 250\n(Figure 2).\n\nThe PTF design is optimized for repeated coverage of\na large sky area in a short amount of time. This is crucial\nfor pursuing the primary science goal, namely to investigate the various populations of transients and variables.\nIn addition, it allows the usage of deeper, coadded images to study persistent sources, ranging from Galactic\nforeground stars to distant galaxies. While it is not possible to predict all of the science that PTF will enable,\na few key areas of interest have been defined and will be\nsummarized below. Here, we first address transient and\nvariable sources from our neighborhood to high redshift,\nfollowed by regularly variable classes and science with\nthe coadded data products. An overview of the sections\nis given in Table 3, while Table 4 summarizes the properties, universal rates, and PTF predictions for transients\nand variables.\nTABLE 3\nSummary of Science Drivers discussed in \u00a7 3\n\nScience Driver\nMain Survey Section\nCataclysmic variables\nDyC, 5DC\n3.1\nClassical novae\n5DC\n3.2\nLuminous red novae, .Ia supernovae\nDyC, 5DC\n3.3\nType Ia supernovae\n5DC\n3.4\nCore-collapse supernovae\n5DC\n3.5\nLuminous & pair-instability supernovae\n5DC\n3.6\nBlazars\n5DC\n3.7\nTidal disruption flares\n5DC\n3.8\n(Orphan) GRB afterglows\nDyC, 5DC\n3.9\nExoplanet transits in Orion\nOrion\n3.10\nEclipsing Objects Around Cool Stars\nDyC\n3.11\nRR Lyrae stars\n5DC\n3.12\nGalactic Variable Stars\nDyC,5DC\n3.13\nMicrolensing\n5DC\n3.14\nNear-Earth objects\n5DC\n3.15\nPTF as follow-up instrument\nToO\n3.16\nCoadded & narrow- band data\nDyc, 5DC, NB 3.17\n\n2.3. Follow-up Strategies\n\nThe key to a successful transient survey lies in the\navailability of follow-up resources, specifically multicolor imaging and spectroscopy. Most other wide-field\nsearches aim to do both discovery and follow-up observations, with the same instrument, or have spectroscopic follow-up biased heavily toward a specific science goal (e.g., ESSENCE, SNLS, and SDSS-II with\nSNe Ia). In contrast, PTF will perform multi-color\nphotometry for all candidate transients using a variety of facilities. Here, a large fraction of Palomar\n60-inch (optical; Cenko et al. 2006), LCOGT1 (optical)\nSuper-LOTIS (optical; Park et al. 1999), KAIT (optical; Filippenko et al. 2001), and PAIRITEL (near-IR;\nBloom et al. 2006) time has been set aside. Additional\nspectroscopy is planned at the Palomar Hale 5-m, MDM\nObservatory, William Herrschel 4.2 m, and Lick 3 m telescopes.\nA detailed discussion of all aspects mentioned in this\nsection as well as the data reduction, analysis, and\n1\n\nhttp://lcogt.net/\n\n3.1. Cataclysmic Variables\n\nCataclysmic variables (CVs) form a broad family of\nhighly variable and dynamical stellar binaries in which\nmatter from a low-mass donor (M<\n\u223c 1 M\u2299 ) is accreted\nonto a white dwarf (M\u2248 1 M\u2299 ; e.g., Warner 1995). Variability, from milliseconds to hundreds of years, arises\nfrom different physical processes, and conclusions derived\nfrom CVs have been extrapolated, upward or downward\nin scale, to other phenomena such as active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and X-ray binaries. Despite being studied\nfor several decades, many details concerning the viscous\nturbulence in the accretion disk, interaction of the accreted matter with the atmosphere of the white dwarf,\nirregularities within regular photometric behavior, and\nthe final fate of these objects, are still missing.\nAn important subclass of CVs is the so-called dwarf novae (DNe), which show quasi-periodic outbursts (on time\nscales of weeks to years) with amplitudes of 3\u20138 mag and\ndurations of typically 3\u201320 d. These transient events are\nthe result of a sudden viscosity change in the accretion\n\n\f4\n\nA. Rau et al.\n\ndisk. The origin of this change is still controversial; instabilities in the disk (Meyer & Meyer-Hofmeister 1981)\nor in the secondary star (Bath et al. 1986) may both be\nresponsible. Increasing the sample of well-studied events\nwill help to distinguish between these models.\nThe current estimate of the space density of\nDNe ranges from \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 pc\u22123 (observations;\nSchwope et al. 2002) to as much as \u223c 10\u22124 pc\u22123 (theory; Kolb 1993). For typical values of peak magnitude\n(9 > MR > 4 mag) and recurrence time scale (1 yr;\nRau et al. 2007b), this suggests the detection of about\n100 DNe yr\u22121 in the 5DC.\nIn special cases, the secondary can be another white\ndwarf or a hydrogen-depleted star in a tight orbit, whose\nevolution is dictated by gravitational wave radiation. Depending on the orbital period, mass transfer can either\nbe through a stable or unstable disk or via direct impact.\nThese so-called AM CVn stars are of particular interest\nas they form the dominant population of gravitational\nwave sources detectable with the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. Merging white\ndwarfs are also strong progenitor candidates for SNe Ia\n(e.g., Iben & Tutukov 1984; Webbink 1984) and thus are\nimportant tracers of binary stellar evolution.\nAM CVn systems with an unstable accretion disk exhibit photometric outbursts similar to those of hydrogenrich dwarf novae and can be detected as transient events\nwith PTF. However, with an inferred space density of\n\u223c (1 \u2212 3) \u00d7 10\u22126 pc\u22123 (Roelofs et al. 2007), AM CVn\nstars are rare compared with normal CVs. Furthermore,\nonly 5-6% of the population resides within the instability\nrange in which outbursts occur, and He ionization results\nin much shorter time scales of these events. Thus, only\na few of these elusive sources are expected to be found\nin the DyC experiments.\n3.2. Classical Novae\n\nIn some CVs the matter accreted onto the primary\nwhite dwarf can experience a thermonuclear runaway,\ndriving substantial mass loss from the system. These\nclassical nova eruptions reach absolute peak magnitudes\nof \u22125 >\n\u223c \u221210 mag (< MR >\u223c \u22127.5 mag in M31;\n\u223c MR >\nShafter et al. 2009) and fade on time scales of days to\nweeks (e.g., Warner 2008).\nA typical M31-like galaxy produces \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u221210 novae\nyr\u22121 L\u22121\n\u2299,K (Ferrarese et al. 2003), translating into \u223c30\n\u22121\nyr . PTF will repeatedly image 60 large, nearby (mM < 29 mag) galaxies as part of the 5DC. We anticipate\n\u223c10 novae yr\u22121 galaxy\u22121 to lie above the detection limit.\nThus, a typical coverage of three months per year for\neach galaxy will provide \u223c150 extragalactic classical nova\ndiscoveries every year.\nThe spatial and luminosity distributions of these novae inside their host galaxies will provide invaluable tests\nof cataclysmic-binary evolution theory. Predictions that\nfast novae should predominantly arise in spiral arms\n(della Valle et al. 1994) are still lacking conclusive observational evidence (e.g., Neill & Shara 2004). The expected dramatic enlargement of the number of accurately\nsampled nova light curves will help to test this prediction.\nIn addition to targeting nearby galaxies, PTF will\nplace the first meaningful limits on the space density\nof intergalactic \"tramp stars\" (Shara 2006) by searching\n\nfor classical novae as their proxies. Previous detections\nof \"tramp\" planetary nebulae and novae in the Virgo\ncluster (Feldmeier et al. 2004) and the Fornax cluster\n(Neill et al. 2005) suggest that 16% to 40% of all stars in\nrich clusters reside in intracluster space outside of galaxies. PTF will probe whether the same is true of less dense\nenvironments like the Local Group, or of intergalactic\nspace in general. In the 5DC, novae originating in a space\nvolume at least four times larger than the Local Group\ncan be detected (out to a distance of D = 2.5 Mpc). We\nexpect \u223c16 tramp novae to be found every year if 10%\nof the stars in and around the Local Group are tramps2 .\nConversely, if zero intergalactic tramps are found, an upper limit on the baryon contribution in the Universe from\nintergalactic tramp stars of \u223c1\u20132% can be set after one\nyear.\n3.3. Other Transients in Nearby Galaxies\nObservations suggest a paucity of transients between\nthe peak absolute brightness of classical novae (MR >\n\u223c\n\u221210 mag) and supernovae (MR <\n\u223c \u221214 mag). However,\nrecent discovery of a number of enigmatic events in this\ngap have demonstrated the potential for exciting discoveries with dedicated experiments.\nOne of these newly emerging classes are the luminous red novae (LRNe), whose origin and explosion\nphysics still pose unsolved puzzles. This elusive group\nof sources includes only four known members: M31 RV\n(Rich et al. 1989), V4332 Sgr (Martini et al. 1999),\nV838 Mon (Brown et al. 2002), and M85 OT 2006-1\n(Kulkarni et al. 2007). Their observational properties\ndiffer from those of classical novae and typical supernovae\nby showing a slowly evolving outburst with an optical\nplateau lasting weeks to months, followed by a strong\nredward evolution resembling a transition from stellar\ntype \u223cF to \u223cM and colder (e.g., Rau et al. 2007a).\nSeveral formation models have been proposed,\nincluding stellar mergers (Soker & Tylenda 2003),\nrare novae (Iben & Tutukov 1992), and supernovae\n(Pastorello et al. 2007); these scenarios need to be\nassessed with an increased sample of accurately\nstudied events. Also, the underlying stellar population of the known sample has a large diversity,\nranging from a B-star cluster in the Milky Way\n(V838 Mon; Af\u015far & Bond 2007) to the bulge of\nM31 (M31 RV; Rich et al. 1989). This leads to the\nquestion of whether the known LRNe form one homogeneous class of objects (with the explosion physics\nbeing independent of the stellar population), or if\ndifferent scenarios apply to each of the individual\nsample members. Note that two additional sources\nat the bright end of the distribution, SN 2008S\n(e.g., Arbour & Boles 2008; Prieto et al. 2008) and\nNGC300 OT (e.g., Monard 2008), have been found\nrecently. Associations with extreme asymptotic giant\nbranch (AGB) stars have been proposed for these events\n(Thompson et al. 2008).\nBased on rates estimated from the number of known\nLRNe (1.5\u00d710\u221213 yr\u22121 L\u22121\n\u2299,K ; Ofek et al. 2008), we ex\u22121\npect to discover > 1.5 yr during the 5DC coverage of\n2 This assumes 8 months per year observation of the \u223c2700 deg2\nof the 5DC and \u223c60 novae yr\u22121 detected in the Local Group\n(mostly M31 and the Galaxy).\n\n\fPTF Science\ngalaxies within 16 Mpc. Over a four-year lifetime of PTF,\nthis will more than double the known sample and provide valuable insight into the origin and properties of\nthese rare transients.\nThe regular PTF monitoring of nearby galaxies will\nalso allow a search for a number of theoretically predicted, but not yet observationally confirmed, populations of transients. Among these are the faint thermonuclear supernovae from AM CVn binaries (\".Ia SNe\",\none-tenth as bright for one-tenth the time as a SN Ia;\nBildsten et al. 2007). Helium that accretes onto the\nwhite dwarf primary can undergo unstable thermonuclear flashes. At wide binary separations (Porb > 25 min)\na large mass will be accumulated before ignition, leading to violent flashes in which high pressure allows the\nburning to produce radioactive elements to power a faint\n(\u221215 >\n\u223c \u221217 mag) and rapidly rising (2\u20135 d)\n\u223c MR >\nthermonuclear supernova. The local Galactic AM CVn\nspace density implies one such explosion every 5,000\u2013\n15,000 yr in 1011 M\u2299 of old stars (\u223c2\u20136% of the SNe Ia\nrate in E/SO galaxies), giving an expected DyC yield of\na few per year. The first possible manifestations of this\nclass in nature have recently been found with SN 2008ha\n(Foley et al. 2009) and SN 2005E (Perets et al. 2009).\n\n5\n\nFig. 3.- Impact of 1000 well-studied, well-calibrated, lowredshift Hubble-flow SNe Ia when mated to near-term simulated\nhigh-redshift surveys (z = 0.9).\n\n3.4. Type Ia Supernovae\n\nObservations of SNe Ia provided the first direct\nand, to date, the best evidence for the acceleration\nof the expansion of the Universe, propelled by some\nkind of mysterious \"dark energy\" (Riess et al. 1998;\nPerlmutter et al. 1999); see Frieman et al. (2008b) for\na review. To determine whether the equation-of-state\nparameter of the dark energy3 is consistent with Einstein's cosmological constant, enormous efforts are underway to populate the SN Ia Hubble diagram with\naccurate measurements of hundreds of events at redshifts 0.1 < z < 1.0. Most noteworthy are the\nSupernova Legacy Survey (SNLS; Astier et al. 2006),\nESSENCE (Miknaitis et al. 2007), and the SDSS SN\nsurvey (Frieman et al. 2008a). Future precision cosmology experiments (e.g., Joint Dark Energy Mission) may\nwork at even higher redshifts (up to z \u2248 1.7).\nSN Ia cosmology relies on comparison of the apparent brightnesses of high-redshift events to those at low\nredshift, to measure accurate relative distances. PTF is\nexpected to discover \u2248 500 SNe Ia yr\u22121 during the 5DC\nin the nearby smooth Hubble flow (0.03 <\n\u223cz<\n\u223c 0.14) out\nof which \u2248 150 yr\u22121 will be followed in detail, all caught\nwell before maximum light and in the lower half of this\nredshift range.\nThe discrimination among specific models of dark energy requires a more detailed understanding of SNe Ia\nand on methods to test for cosmic evolution and other\nsystematic effects, e.g., separation of intrinsic SN colorluminosity relations from dust reddening, impact of the\nenvironment, and evolution of the progenitors with redshift. See Howell et al. (2009) for a review of the largest\nsystematic uncertainties affecting SN Ia and methods\nto mitigate their effects. Owing to the augmented lowredshift statistics and systematics control of the program,\nthe PTF light curves, in conjunction with higher -redshift\n3\n\nw = P/\u03c1 with P being the pressure and \u03c1 is the energy density.\n\ndata, will allow the construction of the most accurate\nSN Ia Hubble diagram yet.\nThe purely statistical impact of a large number of lowredshift SNe Ia on the determination of the cosmic parameters is illustrated in Figure 3. A simulated data set\nof 1000 SNe Ia centered at z = 0.08 is paired with 500\nSNe Ia distributed in the redshift range 0.2 < z < 0.8\nThe constraints on a constant form of the dark energy as\nwell as on the dynamical component are strengthened by\na factor of two when the local sample is included. These\nresults illustrate the impact that the PTF data set can\nhave in the near future. In addition, current SN Ia analyses are dominated by systematic uncertainties and the\nhomogeous, well-calibrated sampling of PTF will provide\nan important improvement.\nThe large area covered by the 5DC experiment will\ninclude a sizable number of relatively nearby, Abelllike galaxy clusters. SNe Ia occurring in these clusters\nwill be of particular interest. The SN rate in galaxy\nclusters is a useful tool to constrain SN Ia progenitors\n(e.g., Maoz & Gal-Yam 2004; Sharon et al. 2007), while\nthe fraction of hostless SNe (Gal-Yam et al. 2003), presumably resulting from progenitors that are members of\nthe intergalactic stellar population in clusters, is a useful\nprobe of the fraction of intergalactic \"tramp\" stars and\nits evolution with redshift.\nPTF's capability to reveal a large number of SN Ia has\nalready been demonstrated by the first discoveries during commissioning. Two events were found by searching 589 deg2 of data taken in a single night on March\n2nd 2009 (Kulkarni et al. 2009). The first source was\ndetected at 18.62 \u00b1 0.04 mag near the core of an SDSS\ngalaxy with g=17.78 and a redshift of z=0.0555 and spectroscopically identified as SN Ia at the Palomar Hale\n5m telescope. The second event was an independent detection of SN 2009an (Cortini et al. 2009). More infor-\n\n\f6\n\nA.

The left and right images show an unnamed SN discovered in an untargeted (SN Factory; 1) and\nSN 2004dh found in a targeted search (Lick Observatory Supernova\nSearch; Li et al. 2000)), respectively. Note the LMC-like faintness\nof the host in the left panel compared to the luminous SN 2004dh\nhost. Such low-luminosity (and probably low-metallicity) hosts are\nlikely to produce new types of SNe. Thus, a sample drawn from\nan untargeted survey such as the PTF 5DC will provide a more\naccurate picture of the cosmic SN population.\n\nmation about the first PTF transient discoveries can be\nfound in (Law et al. 2009).\n3.5. Core-Collapse Supernovae\nThe study of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is critical to understanding the final stages of massive-star evolution and the formation of neutron stars and black holes,\nnatural laboratories for general relativity. Furthermore,\nCCSNe produce heavy elements, dust, and cosmic rays;\ntheir explosion shocks trigger (and inhibit) star formation; and their energy input to the interstellar medium\nis a crucial ingredient in modeling galaxy formation.\nCCSNe will likely form one of the most luminous and\ndistant populations of transients for PTF. Their typical peak absolute magnitudes4 range from MR = \u221214\nto \u221221 mag (< MR >\u2248 \u221217.8 mag), thus allowing detections out to z \u2248 0.4 for the most luminous events.\nBased on discovery statistics from the Supernova Factory\nproject (1), the 5DC is expected to reveal \u223c 200 events\nyr\u22121 shortly after explosion down to R \u2248 19.5 mag.\nMost nearby SNe are discovered by repeated imaging of catalogued galaxies (e.g., Filippenko et al. 2001).\nThis introduces a possible bias, skewing the resulting sample strongly toward events in large, luminous,\nmetal-rich galaxies (Figure 4). Previous untargeted surveys have uncovered peculiar SNe, occurring in small,\nlow-luminosity, and probably metal-poor galaxies (e.g.\nYoung et al. 2008). Metallicity has a strong impact\non the pre-SN evolution of massive stars, influencing\nwind mass loss (and thus the final core mass and composition), loss of angular momentum, and the opacity\n(e.g., Fryer et al. 2007). Also, long-duration gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs), which are associated with very energetic\nCCSNe, have been found in faint, low-metallicity host\ngalaxies (e.g., Stanek et al. 2006; Modjaz et al. 2008).\nThe 5DC provides an untargeted search with thousands of anonymous galaxies in each frame, allowing\none to construct a supernova sample without host-galaxy\n4 Determined from 72 CCSNe from (Richardson et al. 2002) assuming MB \u2212MR \u2248 0 mag.\n\nbias. This will provide an accurate picture of the cosmic\nCCSN population and present observational constraints\non theoretical models for low- and high-metallicity explosions. Assuming galactic luminosity functions measured by the SDSS at z = 0.1 and the linear metallicityluminosity relation (Tremonti et al. 2004), we can estimate that at least \u223c 15% of the SNe detected by PTF\nwill reside in galaxies which are as metal poor as the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and about 20% of those\nwill reside in galaxies more metal-poor than the Small\nMagellanic Cloud (SMC).\nSNe II-P, a subset of CCSNe, have been shown\nto be standardizable by an empirical correlation\n(Hamuy & Pinto 2002; Nugent et al. 2006). Their intrinsic inhomogeneity can be calibrated well and the resulting distance precision for cosmology is about 10%\n(Poznanski et al. 2009), only slightly worse than that of\nSNe Ia (7 %; Astier et al. 2006). PTF will populate the\nSNe II-P Hubble diagram with about 20 Hubble-flow\nevents per month to build an entirely independent and\nnovel test of the cosmology inferred from SNe Ia.\nFinally, with dense sampling of virtually every nearby\ngalaxy observable from the northern hemisphere, PTF\nwill be a powerful discovery machine for the most underluminous (or rapidly decaying) events, providing additional clues to the nature of cosmic explosions with\nvery faint optical displays (e.g., Gal-Yam et al. 2006a;\nBildsten et al. 2007; Pastorello et al. 2004).\n3.6. Luminous Supernovae and Pair-Instability\n\nSupernovae\nThe first stars to form in the Universe typically\nended their brief lives through pair-instability supernovae (e.g., Barkat et al. 1967; Heger & Woosley 2002),\nbut it was long believed that this exit was not available to the metal-enriched stars of the modern era. Recently, however, the discovery of SN 2006gy has provided what may be the first evidence for such an explosion (Ofek et al. 2007; Smith et al. 2007), and surprisingly, this extremely luminous (brighter than \u221220 mag\nfor 150 d), long-lived supernova was found in the local\nUniverse. The pair-instability mechanism requires a star\nto meet its end with a substantial mass still bound to it.\nThe rate of such events in the local Universe will thus significantly augment our understanding of the top end of\nthe stellar initial mass function as well as the role metallicity plays in shedding mass prior to the explosion. As\nSN 2006gy-like events are luminous, expected to occur\nfrequently in the early Universe, and relatively simple\nto model, they may serve as cosmological probes in the\nJames Webb Space Telescope era. Events discovered by\nPTF in the local Universe may serve as a proving ground\nfor their utility.\nThe estimated event rate of \u223c100 Gpc\u22123 yr\u22121 suggest that about 20 (200) SN 2006gy-like events yr\u22121\nabove R = 18 mag (21.0 mag) can be discovered during the course of the 5DC. It is important to note\nthat the handfull of known events have all been discovered in blind surveys (e.g., Texas Supernova Search,\n(Quimby 2006); Catalina Real-time Transient Survey,\n(Drake et al. 2009)), such as PTF.\nThe most luminous supernova yet identified is\nSN 2005ap, found by the TSS (Quimby et al. 2007).\nSmith et al. (2008) suggest that SN 2005ap may be\n\n\fPTF Science\nphysically similar to SN 2006gy, and Quimby et al.\n(2007) note a possible connection to the engines powering GRBs. With only weakly diluted black-body spectra\nand rapid photometric evolution, SN 2005ap-like events\noffer another possible probe of the early U1niverse, and\nPTF can help reveal their physical identity. While a rate\ncannot accurately be measured from a single event, we\nspeculate that SN 2005ap-like events are roughly half as\ncommon as sources similar to SN 2006gy.\nWhile there is not yet any conclusive evidence that\nSN 2005ap, SN 2006gy, or any of the extremely luminous\nSNe are indeed related to Pair-Instability explosions,\nthere is no conclusive evidence that they are not. PTF\nwill significantly expand the sample of well-studied luminous SNe and perhaps provide an answer as to whether\nor not PISNe occur in the local Universe.\n3.7. Blazars\n\nThe light curves of blazars (AGN with the jet pointed\ntowards the observer; e.g., Urry & Padovani 1995) are\ndominated by Doppler-boosted instabilities and other\nphenomena associated with relativistic outflows, rather\nthan by the accretion-driven variability of ordinary AGN.\nThus, variability is one of their most notable characteristics, offering both a method for discovery and insight\ninto their physics.\nBlazars are likely the dominant contributors to\nthe cosmic \u03b3-ray background (Narumoto & Totani 2006;\nGiommi et al. 2006). They also form the main foreground population at high radio frequencies, and an understanding of them will be essential for proper modeling of the cosmic microwave background radiation at\nhigh angular frequencies, such as for the Planck mission (see, e.g., Giommi et al. 2006; Giommi et al. 2007;\nWright et al. 2009).\nMoreover, a growing number\nof blazars has been detected at TeV energies (e.g.,\nHoran & Weekes 2004; Horns 2008). Even more intriguingly, beamed AGN are perhaps among the most plausible sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays, reaching\nenergies of 1021 eV (e.g., Dermer 2007). These cosmic\naccelerators are bound to play an increasingly important\nrole in the future of astro-particle physics.\nThe Fermi mission will play a dominant role in the\nstudies of blazars over the next several years. Groundbased studies from synoptic sky surveys like PTF will\nprovide valuable complementary data for maximum\nscientific returns. First, archival analysis of multiepoch data from PTF, combined with other, previous and ongoing synoptic surveys such as Palomar\nQuest (Djorgovski et al. 2008) or the Catalina Sky Survey (Drake et al. 2009), can be used to define purely\nvariability-based (or variability- and color-based) samples of blazars. This will provide an important check on\nthe selection effects in the more traditional, radio-based\nsamples. Archival light curves and measures of variability can be used in a joint analysis with data from radio to\n\u03b3-rays. This will result in larger, more complete samples\nof blazars, crucial for the studies described above.\nSecond, real-time detection of optical flares of blazars,\ncorrelated with the \u03b3-ray data stream from Fermi, can\nbe used to detect \u03b3-ray loud blazars at fainter flux levels than what would be statistically justifiable from the\n\u03b3-rays alone, or to lead to new blazar discoveries on\ntheir own. These detections can be used to trigger other\n\n7\n\nfollow-up observations; a joint analysis of such multiwavelength, synoptic observations of blazar flares could\nlead to better constraints for theoretical models. Such\nstatistical monitoring of large areas of the sky is complementary to the more traditional follow-up monitoring\nof selected samples of known blazars (e.g., Carini 2004).\nWe estimate that PTF will see at least a few tens of potential Fermi blazars per clear night, of which roughly\none will have a strong optical blazar flare.\nBlazars are known to vary significantly on all time\nscales where data exist, with the power spectra well represented by a power law, so in principle an arbitrarily\nlarge fluctuation can occur given a sufficiently long time\ninterval. In practice, fluctuations at a level of several\ntenths of a magnitude are common on time scales of hours\nor days, and fluctuations at a level of 1 or 2 mag are commonly seen on time scales of months, but with rise or\nfall times as short as a day or even less. This should be\ncontrasted with the variability of normal quasars, where\ntypical variations on a scale of several tenths of a magnitude occur on a time scale of years, and dramatic (e.g.,\nmagnitude or greater) changes are extremely rare on the\ntime scales probed by the existing observations.\n3.8. Tidal Disruption Flares\n\u22122/3\n\nStars passing within a distance of 5M7\nSchwarzschild radii of a supermassive black hole (SMBH)\nof MSMBH = 107 M7 M\u2299 will be torn apart by the strong\ntidal gravitational field (e.g., Hills 1975; Rees 1988).\nWhile for M7 >\n\u223c 20 the disruption of a main-sequence\nstar happens inside the event horizon, for less massive\nSMBHs this should give rise to a detectable flare of\nemission. To date, only a few candidate tidal disruption flares (TDFs) have been found, primarily in the\nROSAT All Sky Survey archive (e.g., Li et al. 2002;\nGezari et al. 2003; Halpern et al. 2004; Komossa 2005)\nand in restframe-UV monitoring of otherwise dormant\ngalaxies (e.g., Renzini et al. 1995; Gezari et al. 2006;\nGezari et al. 2008).\nThe flare emission is predicted to be dominated by\nan optically thick accretion disk with a temperature\n\u22121/4\nTeff \u2248 3 \u00d7 105 M7\nK (Ulmer 1999), peaking in the\nfar-UV. Line emission from unbound (ejected) material\n(Strubbe & Quataert 2009) is expected to significantly\nenhance the black-body continuum flux in the optical.\nThis can lead to a peak absolute magnitude in the rest\nframe of MR \u2248 \u221215 to \u221219 mag (see also Strubbe &\nQuataert 2008) and observationally confirmed by Gezari\net al. 2008), roughly comparable to the absolute magnitude of a supernova. The single-epoch PTF sensitivities suggest that the TDF population will be probed to\n\u223c 200M7 Mpc (z = 0.05), corresponding to a volumetric\n3/2\nrate of 40M7 yr\u22121 over the entire sky or about 3 yr\u22121\nin the 5DC.\nOne of the principal difficulties in pursuing these events\nis in distinguishing TDFs from nuclear SNe and ordinary\nAGN variability. Here both the particular light curve (a\nrapid rise over days to weeks followed by a power-law decline5 ) and spectral evolution provide valuable guidance.\nHistorical variability limits from the DeepSky project6\n5\n6\n\nThe decline of interloping SNe should be exponential.\nhttp://supernova.lbl.gov/\u223cnugent/deepsky.html .\n\n\f8\n\nA. Rau et al.\n\ncan further constrain patterns of low-level AGN activity.\nWe expect roughly 10% of rapidly risig events in galactic nuclei to be TDFs (as opposed to SNe). Having\n\u223c2 kpc resolution at z = 0.05, we must contend not only\nwith nuclear transient events but the light of the hostgalaxy bulge itself. Thus, events from lower-mass (105 \u2013\n106 M\u2299 ) SMBHs may be more reliably identified since\ntheir bulges are expected to be comparatively faint.\nEven if the yield from PTF is only a few iron-clad\ncases, the ensuing multi-frequency investigations will\nhave great value in providing feedback for TDF models and for influencing strategies for future TDF observing campaigns. These discoveries will provide a\nwindow into the demographics of SMBHs and detailed\nfollow-up observations could allow for an entirely new\nway of measuring black hole mass, thus offering an independent test of the MSMBH \u2013\u03c3\u2217 relation of galaxies\n(e.g., Ferrarese & Merritt 2000; Gebhardt et al. 2000;\nTremaine et al. 2002).\n3.9. Untriggered and Orphan GRB Afterglows\n\nBy far the most luminous (up to MR = \u221237 mag) transients that PTF may detect are the afterglows of GRBs\nfor which the ultrarelativistic collimated outflows are\npointed toward the Earth. GRB statistics from BATSE\nonboard CGRO suggest that a few such events happen\nevery day in the Universe (Paciesas et al. 1999), corresponding to \u223c 0.02 deg\u22122 yr\u22121 . Out of these, \u223c 50%\nremain brighter than R = 20 mag for at least 1000 s and\ncan in principle be discovered blindly7 with PTF. These\nuntriggered afterglows may appear as fast transients in\na single or pair of images of the 5DC; however, the expected rate is very small (\u223c 0.5 yr\u22121 ).\nA more numerous population of transients is predicted by the collimated nature of GRBs, observationally suggested by the \"jet breaks\" in afterglow light\ncurves (e.g., Harrison et al. 1999; Stanek et al. 1999;\nFrail et al. 2000; Frail et al. 2001). These orphan afterglows arise when the initial GRB, and its associated afterglow light, are directed away from the observer. Here,\nthe deceleration of the relativistic outflow, the associated\ndecrease in special-relativistic beaming, and the hydrodynamic spreading of the collimated jet combine at the\njet-break time, tjet , to irradiate a rapidly increasing fraction of the sky (e.g., Rhoads 1999). Observers illuminated during this transition will detect a steeply rising\n(\u2206t \u2248 tjet /10) transient that proceeds to behave as a\npost-jet break, on-axis afterglow. It will fade as a powerlaw (F\u03bd \u221d t\u2212\u03b1 ) with \u03b1 \u2248 2.3, referenced to the (unconstrained) burst time, resulting in a decay by \u223c 1 mag\nover a time scale of \u2206t \u2248 1.5tjet. Note that the typical\nobserved jet-break times for GRBs are \u223c1 to 10 d.\nPredicted event rates for PTF are a function of the estimated GRB rate at low redshift\n(Guetta et al. 2005a;\nNakar et al. 2006),\nthe observed optical afterglow luminosity distribution\n(Kann et al. 2008),\nand\nthe\nestimated beaming (or jet break) distributions\n(Guetta et al. 2005a; Nakar et al. 2006).\nThere are\nsubstantial uncertainties in each of these functions; thus,\neven upper limits from well-defined orphan afterglow\n7 By this we mean, not by follow-up observations in response to\na trigger with high-energy observations.\n\nsearches can be used to constrain interesting properties\nof the GRB population.\nThe discovery of an orphan afterglow would serve as\na dramatic confirmation of the \"jet model\" for GRBs.\nMultiple events would begin to map out the beaming\ndistribution and, in addition, provide inputs to physical models of relativistic outflows. Perhaps the most intriguing possibility relates to the merging compact object\nmodel of the short bursts (Fox et al. 2005). Detectable\nshort-burst orphan afterglows will arise from a relatively\nnearby (D <\n\u223c 20 Mpc) merger event, potentially within\nrange of current gravitational wave detectors. By providing a temporal window to searches, and thus increasing their sensitivity, the discovery of an orphan afterglow\ncould even in the best case provoke a first direct detection\nof gravitational waves (Nakar et al. 2006).\nRapidly evolving \"no-host\" transients identified in\nprevious orphan afterglow searches (Becker et al. 2004;\nRau et al. 2006; Malacrino et al. 2007) are now attributed to flare-star activity (Kulkarni & Rau 2006).\nThe upper limits on event rates derived from these surveys are consistent with an expectation for detection of a\nfew orphan afterglows per year in PTF survey work, assuming the foreground \"fog\" of flare star and CV activity\n(Rau et al. 2007b) can be successfully penetrated.\n3.10. Transiting Exoplanets Around Young Stars\nThe majority of the \u223c300 currently known exoplanets have been found around relatively old stars (1\u20137 Gyr;\nSaffe et al. 2005). In contrast, little is known about the\ndistribution and frequency of planets orbiting stars of\n1\u2013100 Myr age. These objects have broadened spectral\nlines (> 200 \u2212 500 m s\u22121 ), which complicate, and make\nmore difficult, the discovery of planets via radial-velocity\nvariations. Here, the detection of planetary transits is a\nmore promising method.\nObservations of transiting planets allow one to determine important physical characteristics and place significant constraints on the internal structure of planets\n(Burrows et al. 2000). Specifically, the radius (obtainable only for transiting planets) provides a direct estimate of the age, composition, and surface temperature (Saumon et al. 1996). Studies show the existence\nof \"inflated\" planets with unexpectedly large radii or low\ndensities (e.g., WASP-1b, HAT-P-1b; Bakos et al. 2006;\nCameron et al. 2007) that current models fail to explain\n(Pont et al. 2007). Next, assessing the distribution and\nfrequency of planets around young stars can also set detailed constraints on the time scales of formation and\nevolution of planetary systems (e.g., Baraffe et al. 2003).\nDuring 40 consecutive nights in each of the first\nthree years after commissioning, PTF will provide high\nphotometric precision measurements (0.1\u20132%) for \u223c\n50, 000 stars toward the Orion region. Approximately\n5\u201310% of these stars will be young stars (1\u201310 My;\nCarpenter et al. 2001). The large number of dedicated\nconsecutive nights results in a >\n\u223c 90% sensitivity to orbital periods of Porb . 10 d (see Figure 5). If the\nfraction of the systems with favorable inclination is \u223c\n10% and the planetary distribution and frequency are\nsimilar to those of main-sequence stars (1 out of 150;\nMarcy et al. 2004), we anticipate 10\u201315 transiting planets to be found with this experiment. However, even a\n\n\fPTF Science\nnull detection would set valuable limits on the presence of\ngiant planets with short period orbits. The transit search\nis based upon a box-shaped matched filter algorithm and\nuses frequency filtering and variability-fitting to reduce\nthe effects of the intrinsic variability of the stars (e.g.,\nAirgrain et al. 2007). These techniques have been very\nsuccessful in finding small transit signals in intrinsically\nvariable stars (e.g., CoRoT-7b; Leger et al. 2009).\nThe transit survey is most sensitive to Jupiter sized\n(and mass) planets in few day orbits around stars of\n. 1 M\u2299 . Follow-up observations will include high spatial\nresolution imaging to search for background eclipsing binaries, and medium resolution spectroscopy and radial\nvelocity monitoring (\u223c 500 m s\u22121 precision) to rule out\nstellar or brown companions. Jupiter-sized planets in\nshort orbital periods produce radial velocity variations\non the order of a few hundred meters per second. Higher\nprecision monitoring (50 \u2212 200 m s\u22121 ), coupled with the\nknown orbital period determined from the photometric\nobservations, should provide sufficient precision to confirm the presence or absence of the candidate planets.\nThe Orion observations will also provide a unique\ndataset for a variety of aspects of stellar astrophysics.\nThe high-precision time-series data will enable the search\nfor, and characterization of, eclipsing binary systems\nsuitable for testing star formation and evolution models,\ncharacterizing the activity and rotation periods of young\nstars, and identifying and characterizing previously unknown young stars in the Orion region.\n\nFig. 5.- Prediction of the window function for the Orion program. The dashed and solid lines correspond to the detection probabilities of one and two transits, respectively. The white (photon)\nnoise is assumed to be 0.01 mag, and the red (systematic) noise is\nassumed to be 10% of the total photometric noise. Other input parameters are stellar/planetary radius = 1.0/0.1 R\u2299 , 40 consecutive\nnights, and a 1 min observing cadence.\n\n3.11. Eclipsing Objects Around Cool Stars\n\nCurrent radial-velocity surveys for extrasolar planets\npreferentially target bright FGKM stars with masses\nwithin a factor of two of M\u2299 . Thus far only \u223c10\nplanetary systems have been detected around stars\nwith masses < 0.5M\u2299 and radial-velocity surveys of\nM-dwarfs have been limited to the brightest M0 to\nM3 stars (e.g., Endl et al. 2006; Johnson et al. 2007).\n\n9\n\nThe higher-mass M-dwarfs that have been probed\nhave a low Jupiter-mass planet companion frequency\n(<\u223c2%; eg. Johnson et al. 2007), but theory predicts a\nlarge population of lower-mass planets (Ida & Lin 2005;\nKennedy & Kenyon 2008). The characteristics of the\nlower-mass M-dwarf planet population are essentially unknown, mostly because the stars are too faint for current radial-velocity planet searches. As M-dwarfs are the\nmost common stars in our galaxy, there is a clear gap to\nbe addressed in our knowledge of the galactic planetary\npopulation.\nThe PTF R-band DyC experiment offers an opportunity to search M-dwarfs for stellar eclipses and planetary\ntransits. The survey is expected to greatly increase the\nnumber of known eclipsing cool star systems (vital for\ncalibration of the mass-to-luminosity relation at the low\nend), to obtain detailed statistics on the population of\nclose substellar companions, to watch for variability and\nactivity, and ultimately to be capable of detecting lowmass transiting planets.\nBy specifically targeting faint M-dwarfs, we greatly reduce the normally extreme precision requirements for\nplanet transit surveys. Going down to mR =20.0, the\nfaintest stars in the survey will have approximately\nSNR=10 per image, sufficient to detect planets as small\nas Saturn (0.087 R\u2299) around M5 dwarfs (\u223c0.2 R\u2299 ) with\nSNR=2 in each of many observations during transits.\nWith few-percent photometric precision on bright Mdwarfs, PTF could detect Neptune-radius planets.\nIn each R-band high-cadence PTF field we will be able\nto search a few thousand M-dwarfs for transitory flux\ndecreases, depending on galactic latitude. By covering a\nvery large sample of stars, but at relatively low photometric precision and with observation gaps, this survey\nwill be complementary to targeted cool star transit surveys such as the MEarth project (Irwin et al. 2009).\nAssuming a representative DyC observing setup, we\nexpect to search approx. 105 M-dwarfs per year for companions in a variety of orbits. Scaling against other Mdwarf eclipsing binary surveys, the survey could find tens\nof new M-dwarf eclipsing binary systems per year. Assuming that 2% of M-dwarfs have giant planetary companions with periods <30 d, in a uniform period distribution, and modeling detection probability factors from\nthe survey cadences, transit lengths, weather losses and\nthe inclination ranges of the possible systems, PTF also\nhas the possibility of detecting several bona-fide transiting planet systems per year. Follow up efforts will include extensive photometric and spectroscopic observing\nprograms to eliminate false detections, and ultimately infrared radial-velocity measurements (using, for example,\nT-EDI on the Palomar Hale 5m Telescope; Muirhead et\nal. (2008)) to confirm the presence of planets.\n3.12. RR Lyrae Stars\nRR Lyrae are short-period, yellow or white giant pulsating variables. They are the most well-calibrated,\nnear-field distance indicators known. With a mean\nmagnitude of MR \u2248 0.3 \u00b1 0.2 mag for stars with\n\u22122.6 <[Fe/H]< \u22121.6 dex and a weak metallicity dependence, RR Lyrae have been used to measure distances throughout the Local Group. They have also\nbeen used to probe the kinematics and the global density distribution of the Galactic halo (Vivas & Zinn 2003;\n\n\f10\n\nA. Rau et al.\n\nIvezi\u0107 et al. 2004; Kinman et al. 2007). Having many\nthousands of RR Lyrae stars over a significant fraction\nof the sky will enable us to better constrain not only\nthe stellar density as a function of radius, but also the\nthree-dimensional shape of the Galactic halo.\nAnother strong motivation for extending the sample\nof RR Lyrae variables is the mapping of substructures\nwithin the halo. It is still not completely clear whether\nthe Galaxy formed primarily in a single, homogeneous\ncollapse (Eggen et al. 1962), or the majority of stars\nwere assimilated through the accretion of many smaller\ngalaxies and galactic fragments (Searle & Zinn 1978).\nThe distribution of RR Lyrae candidates in the SDSS is\ndecidedly inhomogeneous, and a population of RR Lyrae\nstars associated with the Sagittarius tidal stream has\nbeen found (Ivezi\u0107 et al. 2004). Since then, several\nother large tidal streams believed to be the remnants of accreted galaxies have been detected out\nto \u223c 50 kpc (Yanny et al. 2003; Belokurov et al. 2006;\nGrillmair 2006a; Grillmair 2006b; Grillmair 2008, ; see\nFigure 6). A large-area survey for RR Lyrae stars will\nallow much more accurate distances and orbital trajectories to be determined for these streams. Moreover,\nwith a clean sample of RR Lyrae stars selected through\nmulti-epoch light curve analysis, this would enable us to\nextend our reach well beyond the \u224850 kpc achieved to\ndate using turn-off stars in the SDSS, and detect additional debris streams out to \u223c100 kpc. Follow-up spectroscopy and proper-motion measurements of RR Lyrae\nstars in streams will put strong constraints not only on\nthe global Galactic potential but also on its lumpiness\n(Murali & Dubinski 1999).\nMost known RR Lyrae stars are fundamental- mode\npulsators with periods on the order of <\n\u223c 1 d. By virtue\nof its large areal coverage, the 5DC will be the most useful for detecting RR Lyrae stars throughout the Galactic halo. While the cadence is not particularly adapted\nto the detection of these stars on short time scales, the\n\u223c 400 separate images per field over the course of the\nsurvey (half of which will be separated by \u223c 60 min)\nwill enable the identification of RR Lyrae stars and\ntheir mean magnitudes using standard time-series filtering techniques.\nWith a limiting magnitude per exposure of R = 21.0,\nPTF will be able to detect RR Lyrae stars at distances of 10\u2013115 kpc. Kinman et al. (2007) found\n26 RR Lyrae stars within 8 kpc in a 200 deg2 area\ncentered on the north Galactic pole. Using this as\na measure of the local volume density and adopting\na radial density profile in the Galactic halo which\nfalls as \u03c1 \u221d R\u22122.7 (Siegel et al. 2002), an integration\nover the 10,000 deg2 area of the 5DC yields an expected total of 28,000 RR Lyrae stars. Changing the\npower-law index to \u22122.5 (Robin et al. 2000) or \u22123.3\n(Sommer-Larsen & Zhen 1990) yields estimated totals of\n38,000 and 14,000, respectively. These numbers are at\nleast an order of magnitude larger than any previous\nRR Lyrae study; the final PTF database will clearly be\na boon to investigations of both the global structure of\nthe Galactic halo and of the substructures within it.\n3.13. Other Galactic variables\n\nBeside the already mentioned RR Lyrae stars many\nmore classes and subclasses of variables can be stud-\n\nied with PTF. In particular, the combination of PTF\nvariability information and SDSS photometric colors can\ncharacterize stellar variability across the HertzsprungRussel diagram. Characterizing the detailed stellar variability is also imperative in the search of genuine transients.\nUnderstanding the processes that lead to luminosity\nchanges in stars is vital to decipher the stellar evolution. This 5DC survey with its wide-area coverage will\nenable the discovery of rare sources such as R CrB stars\n(Iben & et al. 1996), the non-radial magnetic pulsating\nAp stars (Shibahashi 1987), and SX Phe stars. The nature of the later is uncertain as they can be the result of\nstellar mergers or stars evolving towards the white dwarf\nstage (Cacciari & Clementini 1990).\nR CrB stars are also linked to stellar mergers, specifically the merger of hydrogen-deficient stars or of a Neutron star with Helium rich star. The birthrate of R CrB\nstars is estimated to be 0.004\u20130.1 yr\u22121 in the Milky Way\n(Iben & et al. 1996) and the predicted short life time\nleads to estimates that approx. 1000 sources are currently existing in our galaxy. Using their space and velocity distribution, PTF may able to resolve the fundamental question to which population (e.g., thick disk)\nthey belong.\nWe will construct light curves for all stars in the PTF\nfootprint in the range 14<R< 21 mag. Each of these data\nsets will consist of approximately 200-400 data points\nover all time scales from about one hour (and in some\ncases minutes) to several years.\n3.14. Microlensing\n\nMicrolensing events occur when a large stellar-mass object passes in front of a background star. They take\nthe form of a magnification of the background star and\nlast on the order of several weeks, depending on the\nlensing geometry and lens mass. Lensing light curves\nhaving high temporal resolution offer the opportunity\nto detect planets around the lensing stars, while lowmass brown dwarfs and other faint nearby objects can be\nfound by the lensing they induce without an obvious lens\nstar. Current microlensing surveys such as OGLE (e.g.,\nPont et al. 2008) and MOA (e.g., Bennett et al. 2008)\nfind \u223c1000 events yr\u22121 .\nMicrolensing surveys are usually targeted toward\nhighly crowded stellar fields to maximize the event probability. PTF plans to avoid these fields to minimize stellar contamination to extragalactic transients. However,\nPTF's much larger FoV allows coverage of many more\nhigh Galactic latitude stars than current microlensing\nprojects can provide. On the other hand, at high Galactic latitude the number of suitable distant stars to be\nlensed is lower.\n(Han 2008) has performed detailed simulations of the\nexpected event rate for a PTF-like survey. With a limiting magnitude of V = 18 mag an all-sky event rate\nof \u223c 23 yr\u22121 is expected (for events with magnification\n>1.34). Approximately half of those events will occur\nat |b| > 30\u25e6 . Extrapolating the (Han 2008) results to\nR = 21 mag suggests 200\u2013300 events yr\u22121 throughout\nthe sky.\nWith a typical time scale of about 20 d, these events\ncan be detected in the 5DC with sufficient time to organize follow-up observations with high temporal resolution\n\n\fPTF Science\n\n11\n\nFig. 6.- A composite, filtered surface density map of stars in the SDSS Data Release 5. Stars in DR5 have been filtered to select stellar\npopulations at different distances with color-magnitude sequences similar to that of the globular cluster M13 (e.g., Grillmair 2008). Lighter\nshades indicate areas of enhanced surface density, and different portions of the field have been filtered for stars at different distances.\nVarying noise levels are a consequence of the very different levels of foreground contamination using these different filters. The distances\nof the streams range from 4 kpc for Acheron, to 9 kpc for GD-1 and the Anticenter Stream, to \u223c50 kpc for Sagittarius and Styx.\n\nfor the later parts of the light curve, to search for planets. Taking into account the PTF footprint, we expect\nthe 5DC to find about 5 stellar-stellar events per year.\nIn addition, PTF will be sensitive to microlensing events\ncaused by other optically faint, massive objects.\n3.15. Solar System Objects\n\nPTF will detect and measure orbits for many Solar\nSystem bodies. In particular, asteroids will form the\ndominant variable foreground population. Depending on\necliptic latitude, the predicted number of known asteroids brighter than R = 20.5 mag ranges from \u223c 30 deg\u22121\n(\u03b2 = 0 deg) to \u223c 0.01 deg\u22121 (\u03b2 > 50 deg).\nNear-Earth Objects (NEOs) are a subgroup of asteroids and comets that have been nudged by the gravitational attraction of nearby planets into orbits that allow them to enter the Earth's neighborhood. They are\nof astronomical interest as nearby samples of planetesimals left over from the formation of the Solar System.\nThe Earth was built from such planetesimals, and the\nouter layers of Earth, including the biosphere, have been\nstrongly effected by asteroids and comets that impacted\nthe early planet after it had solidified.\nNEO discovery and characterization is also critical to\nassessing the impact risk hazard, as objects of size 1 km\ncould have catastrophic planet-wide consequences. Here,\nPTF will contribute to NEO discovery and orbit determination by delivering astrometric and photometric measurements comparable (or even superior) to the those of\nthe best currently-operating surveys (Table 5). In this\n\nway, PTF will provide a valuable testing ground for NEO\nsearches with Pan-STARRS and LSST. The PTF NEO\nsurvey will be performed using the database of source extractions obtained by the main image-reduction pipeline.\nNon-stationary objects will be separated from the stationary objects detected in the 5DC.\nBased on the estimated population of km-size nearEarth asteroids (Bottke et al. 2002), discovery statistics (Moon et al. 2008), and the PTF observing strategy (which avoids the ecliptic plane), approximately 75\ndiscoveries per year are within reach of the PTF; in practice, the highly experienced Catalina and LINEAR surveys are likely to report most of these discoveries first,\nso the main PTF contribution will be confirmation and\nastrometry.\n3.16. Transients Discovered Outside the Optical Band\n\nMost of the time, PTF will operate in survey mode (see\n\u00a7 2.2). However, the 7.9 deg2 field of view is also ideal to\nsearch for optical counterparts to transients discovered at\nother wavelengths (e.g., radio, \u03b3-rays) or by other means\nthan electromagnetic radiation (e.g., gravitational waves,\nneutrinos, ultra-high-energy cosmic-rays). The first direct detection of gravitational waves is expected to come\nfrom the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) in its enhanced (start \u223c 2009) and advanced (\u223c 2013) stages.

These events will likely be optically faint compared to standard supernovae, but still\ndetectable in the nearby Universe with PTF. Once identified, the light curves will provide insight into the\nexplosion physics as well as into the fraction of radioactive material advected into the black hole. Sim-\n\nilarly, observations of the expected dim supernovae\n(Li & Paczy\u0144ski 1998) or macronovae (Kulkarni 2005)\nassociated with LIGO-detected merging compact objects\nwill immediately lead to a trove of results. In particular,\nthe ejected mass is sensitive to the equation of state of\ndense matter and the type of binary (double neutron star\nvs. neutron star/black hole).\nThe IceCube Neutrino Observatory (Klein et al. 2008)\nwill soon deliver automated alerts to follow-up observations of detections of pairs of neutrinos. With typical\npositional uncertainties of these events of 1\u20132\u25e6, PTF can\nhelp to find the optical counterparts.\nPTF will also advance our understanding of the new\nclass of mysterious radio transients which has materialized in recent years (e.g., Levinson et al. 2002;\nGal-Yam et al. 2006b; Bower et al. 2007). These events\nwere discovered in archival data; thus, nothing is known\nabout their transient appearance at other wavelengths.\nFurthermore, no quiescent X-ray, optical, near-infrared,\nand radio counterparts have been found. The event\nrate is overwhelming and estimated to be between 100\nand 13,000 deg\u22122 yr\u22121 with typical time scales of \u223c0.1\u2013\n1 d. Within the framework of the dynamic cadence experiments, and in combination with new radio observations, PTF will attempt to resolve the nature of these\nevents and probe their possible association with the elusive Galactic population of isolated-old neutron stars\n(Ofek 2008).\n3.17. Science with Coadded Broad- and Narrow-Band\n\nImages\nBy the end of 2012, PTF will have observed each pointing in the 5DC footprint (i.e., \u223c 10, 000 deg2 ) about 60\n\n\fPTF Science\ntimes. The combined R-band images will be deeper than\nthe SDSS r-band images by about 1\u20132 mag. Although\nthe typical image quality will be 2\u2032\u2032 , these data will provide an excellent deep fiducial sky for many astronomical\nprojects and can be mined for a variety of large-scale science applications.\nAs discussed in section 2.2, PTF will perform deep 3\u03c0\nsr surveys in several narrow-band filters, including H\u03b1.\nThe resulting sky map will provide an unprecedented\nhigh-resolution view on the structure of the diffuse, ionized component of the interstellar medium in the Milky\nWay. This information will be vital for understanding the\ndynamics and evolutionary history of the interstellar gas.\nNext, new structures, such as stellar wind bubbles, supernova remnants, bow-shock nebulae, shells around old\nnovae (Shara et al. 2007), and planetary nebula shells\nwith large angular extent are anticipated to be found.\nFurthermore, we will find low-surface-brightness starforming galaxies in the local Universe, and based on the\nH\u03b1 emission strength we will be able to estimate the\nstar-formation rate (e.g., Kennicutt 1998) of the galaxies\nwithin about 40 Mpc in our survey footprint (except for\ngalaxies in the zone of avoidance).\n4. CONCLUSION & OUTLOOK\n\nThe Palomar Transient Factory is a wide-field\n(7.9 deg2 ) imaging facility at the Palomar 48-inch Oschin\nSchmidt telescope, dedicated to mining the optical sky\nfor transients and variables. Its main strengths are\nthe exceptionally large sky coverage to a depth of\nR \u2248 21.0 mag and the almost full-time operation (80%).\nNearly real-time discovery of transient candidates will\nallow rapid follow-up observations with a wide range\nof committed telescopes, including optical and nearinfrared photometry as well as spectroscopy.\nPTF is expected to uncover numerous new members\nof a variety of source populations (see Table 4), ranging from distant supernovae to nearby cataclysmic. Furthermore, the exploration of new regions in phase space\n(e.g., cadence, environment) often yields unexpected discoveries. Thus, PTF is poised to provide an important\ncontribution to filling the existing gaps in the transient\nphase space (Figure 1), paving the path for future syn-\n\n13\n\noptic surveys, such as LSST.\nThis paper is based on observations obtained with the\nSamuel Oschin Telescope and the 60-inch Telescope at\nthe Palomar Observatory as part of the Palomar Transient Factory project, a scientific collaboration between\nthe California Institute of Technology, Columbia University, Las Cumbres Observatory, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the National Energy Research\nScientific Computing Center, the University of Oxford,\nand the Weizmann Institute of Science.
