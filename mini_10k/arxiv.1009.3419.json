Their goal is to describe some recent results on Brenier's variational models for\nincompressible Euler equations [1, 2, 4].\n\n1\n\nEuler incompressible equations and Arnold geodesics\n\nLet D denote either a bounded domain of Rd or the d-dimentional torus Td := Rd /Zd . We consider\nan incompressible fluid moving inside D with velocity u. The Euler equations for u describe the\nevolution in time of the velocity field, and are given by\n\u001a\n\u2202t u + (u * \u2207)u = \u2212\u2207p in [0, T ] \u00d7 D,\ndiv u = 0\nin [0, T ] \u00d7 D,\ncoupled with the boundary condition\nu*\u03bd =0\n\non [0, T ] \u00d7 \u2202D\n\nwhen D 6= Td . Here p is the pressure field, and arises as a Lagrange multiplier for the divergence-free\nconstraint on the velocity u.\nIf u is smooth we can write the above equations in Lagrangian coordinates: let g denote the flow\nmap of u, that is\n\u001a\n\u0121(t, a) = u(t, g(t, a)),\ng(0, a) = a.\nBy the incompressibility condition, and the classical differential identity\nd\ndet\u2207a g(t, a) = div u(t, g(t, a)) det\u2207a g(t, a),\ndt\n(here and in the sequel div denotes the spatial divergence of a possibly time-dependent vector field)\nwe get det\u2207a g(t, a) \u2261 1. This means that g(t, *) : D \u2192 D is a measure-preserving diffeomorphism\nof D:\n\u0001\ni.e. \u03bcD (g(t, *)\u22121 (E)) = \u03bcD (E) \u2200E .\ng(t, *)# \u03bcD = \u03bcD\n\u2217 Scuola\n\nNormale Superiore di Pisa, Piazza dei Cavalieri 7, 56126 Pisa, Italy (l.ambrosio@sns.it)\nof Mathematics, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin TX 78712,\n(figalli@math.utexas.edu)\n\u2020 Department\n\n1\n\nUSA\n\n\fHere\nand in the\nR sequel f# \u03bc is the push-forward of a Borel measure \u03bc through a map f : X \u2192 Y (i.e.\nR\n\u03c6 \u25e6 f d\u03bc for all Borel bounded functions \u03c6 : Y \u2192 R), and \u03bcD is the volume measure\n\u03c6\ndf\n\u03bc\n=\n#\nX\nY\nof D, renormalized by a constant so that \u03bcD (D) = 1.\nWriting Euler's equations in terms of g we obtain an ODE for t 7\u2192 g(t) in the space SDiff(D) of\nmeasure-preserving smooth diffeomorphisms of D:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 g\u0308(t, a) = \u2212\u2207p (t, g(t, a)) (t, a) \u2208 [0, T ] \u00d7 D,\ng(0, a) = a\na \u2208 D,\n(1)\n\uf8f3\ng(t, *) \u2208 SDiff(D)\nt \u2208 [0, T ].\n\n1.1\n\nWeak solutions to Euler's equations\n\nIn the case d = 2, existence of distributional solutions can be proved through the vorticity formulation: setting \u03c9t (*) = curl u(t, *), so that u(t, *) = \u2207\u22a5 \u2206\u22121 \u03c9t , the Euler equations can be read as\nfollows:\n\u0001\nd\n\u03c9t (x) + div \u03c9t (x)u(t, x) = 0.\ndt\nFormally, this equation preserves all Lp norms of solutions, and indeed existence is not hard to\nobtain if \u03c90 \u2208 Lp for 1 < p \u2264 \u221e. Delort improved the existence theory up to L1 or measure\ninitial conditions \u03c90 whose positive (or negative) part is absolutely continuous, and it is still open\nthe problem of getting a solution for all measure initial data. As shown by Yudovitch [15, 16]\nuniqueness holds for p = \u221e, while it is still open in all the other cases.\nIn the case d > 2 much less is known: no general global existence results of distributional\nsolutions is presently available.\n\n1.2\n\nArnold's geodesic interpretation\n\nAt least formally, one can view the space SDiff(D) of measure-preserving diffeomorphisms of D as an\ninfinite-dimensional manifold with the metric inherited from the embedding in L2 (D; Rd ), and with\ntangent space made by the divergence-free vector fields. Using this viewpoint, Arnold interpreted\nthe ODE (1), and therefore Euler's equations, as a geodesic equation on SDiff(D). Therefore one\ncan look for solutions of Euler's equations on [0, 1] \u00d7 D by minimizing the Action functional\nA (g) :=\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\nZ\n\nD\n\n1\n|\u0121(t, x)|2 d\u03bcD (x) dt\n2\n\namong all paths g(t, *) : [0, 1] \u2192 SDiff(D) with g(0, *) = f and g(1, *) = h prescribed (typically,\nby right invariance, f is taken as the identity map i). Ebin and Marsden proved in [10] that this\nproblem has indeed a unique solution when h \u25e6 f \u22121 is sufficiently close, in a strong Sobolev norm, to\ni. We shall denote by \u03b4(f, h) the Arnold distance in SDiff(D) induced by this minimization problem.\nOf course, this variational problem differs from Euler's problem, because the initial and final\ndiffeomorphisms, and not the initial velocity, are prescribed. Nevertheless, the investigation of\nthis problem leads to difficult and still not completely understood questions (typical of Calculus of\nVariations) namely:\n(a) Necessary and sufficient optimality conditions;\n(b) Regularity of the pressure field;\n(c) Regularity of (relaxed) curves with minimal length.\nBefore describing some of the main contributions in this field, let us recall some \"negative\" results\nthat motivate somehow the necessity of relaxed formulations of this minimization problem.\n2\n\n\f1.3\n\nNon-attainment and non-existence results\n\nShnirelman [12, 13] found the example of a map \u1e21 \u2208 SDiff([0, 1]2 ) which cannot be connected to i\nby a path with finite action, i.e. \u03b4(i, \u1e21) = +\u221e. Furthermore, he proved that for h \u2208 SDiff([0, 1]3 ) of\nthe form\nh(x1 , x2 , x3 ) = (\u1e211 (x1 , x2 ), \u1e212 (x1 , x2 ), x3 ), with (\u1e211 , \u1e212 ) = \u1e21 as above,\n\u03b4(i, h) is not attained, i.e. no minimizing path between i and h exists (although there exist paths\nwith a finite action). This fact can be easily explained as follows (see also [8, Paragraph 1.3]): since\nthere is no two dimensional path with finite action connecting i to \u1e21 while in 3 dimension it is known\nthat the minimal action is finite [12], if a minimizing path t 7\u2192 g(t) exists then it has a non-trivial\nthird component, i.e. g3 (t, x) 6\u2261 x3 . Set \u03b7(x3 ) := min{2x3 , 2 \u2212 2x3 }, and let u denote the velocity\nfield associated to g, i.e. u = \u0121 \u25e6 g \u22121 . Then it is easily seen that the velocity field\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 u1 (x1 , x2 , \u03b7(x3 ))\nu2 (x1 , x2 , \u03b7(x3 ))\n\u0169(x1 , x2 , x3 ) :=\n\uf8f3 1\n2 u3 (x1 , x2 , \u03b7(x3 ))\n\ninduces a path g\u0303 which still joins i to h, but with strictly less action (since u3 is not identically\nzero). This contradicts the minimality of g, and proves that there is no minimizing path between i\nand h. (See also [8, Paragraph 1.3].)\nLet us point out that the above argument shows that minimizing sequences exhibit oscillations\non small scales, and strongly suggest the analysis of weak solutions.\n\n1.4\n\nTime discretization, minimal projection and optimal transport\n\nBefore describing the concept of relaxed solutions to the Euler equations introduced by Brenier, let us\nfirst see what happens when one tries to attack the above variational problem by time-discretization:\nassume D \u2282 Rd , and fix g0 , g1 \u2208 SDiff(D). We want to find the \"midpoint\" g1/2 between g0 and g1 ,\nthat is we consider\no\nn1\n1\nkg \u2212 g0 k2L2 (D;Rd ) + kg1 \u2212 gk2L2 (D;Rd ) .\nmin\n2\ng\u2208SDiff(D) 2\nUp to rearranging the terms and removing all the quantities independent on g, the above problem\nis equivalent to minimize\ng0 + g1 2\ng\u2212\n,\nmin\n2\nL2 (D;Rd )\ng\u2208SDiff(D)\n1\n\u2208 L2 (D; Rd ). Since the set\ni.e. we have to find the L2 -projection on SDiff(D) of the function g0 +g\n2\nSDiff(D) is neither closed nor convex, no classical theory is available to ensure the existence of such\nprojection.\nIn order to make the problem more treatable, let us close SDiff(D): as shown for instance in [9],\nif D = [0, 1]d or D = Td then the L2 -closure of SDiff(D) in L2 (D; Rd ) coincides with the space S(D)\nof measure preserving maps:\n\b\nS(D) := g : D \u2192 D : \u03bcD (g \u22121 (A)) = \u03bcD (A) \u2200A \u2208 B(D) .\n\nThen the general problem we want to study becomes the following: given h \u2208 L2 (D; Rd ), solve\nZ\nmin\n|h \u2212 s|2 d\u03bcD .\n(2)\ns\u2208S(D)\n\nD\n\nAs in the classical optimal transport problem, one can consider the following Kantorovich relaxation:\ndenoting by \u03a0(Rd ) the set of probability measures on Rd \u00d7 Rd with first marginal \u03bcD and second\nmarginal \u03bd := h# \u03bcD , we minimize\nZ\nmin\n|x \u2212 y|2 d\u03b3(x, y).\n(3)\n\u03b3\u2208\u03a0(Rd )\n\nRd \u00d7Rd\n\n3\n\n\fAssume the non-degeneracy condition \u03bd \u226a dx. Then we can apply the classical theory of optimal\ntransport with quadratic cost for the problem of sending \u03bd onto \u03bcD [6]: there exists a unique optimal\ntransport map \u2207\u03c6 : Rd \u2192 Rd such that (\u2207\u03c6)# \u03bd = \u03bcD . Moreover the unique optimal measure \u03b3\u0304\nwhich solves (3) is given by\n\u03b3\u0304 = (\u2207\u03c6 \u00d7 Id)# \u03bd.\nThen it is easily seen that the map\ns\u0304 := \u2207\u03c6 \u25e6 h\nbelongs to S(D) and uniquely solves (2) (see [6] or [14, Chapter 3] for more details).\n\n2\n\nRelaxed solutions\n\nIn the last paragraph we have seen how the attempt of attacking Arnold's geodesics problem by\ntime discretization leads to study the existence of the L2 -projection onto SDiff(D), and that the\nprojection of a function h onto its closure S(D) exists and is unique whenever h satisfies a nondegeneracy condition. Instead of going on with this strategy, we now want to change point of view,\nattacking the problem by a relaxation in \"space\".\nTwo levels of relaxation can be imagined: the first one is to relax the smoothness and injectivity\nconstraints, and this leads to the definition of the space S(D) of measure-preserving maps. However,\nwe will see that a second level is necessary, giving up the idea that g(t, *) is a map, but allowing it\nto be a measure preserving plan (roughly speaking, a multivalued map). This leads to the space\n\u0393(D) := {\u03b7 \u2208 P(D \u00d7 D) : \u03b7(A \u00d7 D) = \u03bcD (A) = \u03b7(D \u00d7 A) \u2200A \u2208 B(D)} .\nThe space S(D) \"embeds\" into \u0393(D) considering\nS(D) \u220b g 7\u2192 (i \u00d7 g)# \u03bcD \u2208 \u0393(D).\nConversely, any \u03b7 \u2208 \u0393(D) concentrated on a graph is induced by a map g \u2208 S(D).\nEven from the Lagrangian viewpoint, it is natural to follow the path of each particle, and to\nrelax the smoothness and injectivity constraints, allowing fluid paths to split, forward or backward\nin time. These remarks led in 1989 Brenier to the following model [5]: let\n\u03a9(D) := C ([0, 1]; D) ,\n\net (\u03c9) := \u03c9(t), t \u2208 [0, 1].\n\nThen, denoting by P(\u03a9(D)) the family of probability measures in \u03a9(D), we minimize the action\nfunctional\nZ\nZ\n1 1 2\n|\u03c9\u0307| dt d\u03b7(\u03c9),\n\u03b7 \u2208 P(\u03a9(D))\nA (\u03b7) :=\n\u03a9(D) 2 0\nwith the endpoint and incompressibility constraints\n(e0 , e1 )# \u03b7 = (i \u00d7 h)# \u03bcD ,\n\n(et )# \u03b7 = \u03bcD \u2200t \u2208 [0, T ].\n\nIn Brenier's model, a flow is modelled by a random path with some constraints on the expectations of\nthis path. As we will see below, this problem can be recast in the optimal transportation framework,\ndealing properly with the incompressibility constraint.\nClassical flows g(t, a) induce generalized ones, with the same kinetic action, via the relation\n\u03b7 = (\u03a6g )# \u03bcD , with\n\u03a6g : D \u2192 \u03a9(D),\n\u03a6g (a) := g(*, a).\nIn this relaxed model, some obstructions of the original one disappear: for instance, in the\ncase D = [0, 1]d or D = Td it is always possible to connect any couple of measure preserving\n4\n\n\f\u221a\ndiffeomorphism by a path with action less than d. Actually, this allows to prove that finite-action\npaths exist in many situation: as shown in [1, Theorem 3.3], given a domain D for which there\nexists a bi-Lipschitz measure-preserving diffeomorphism \u03a6 : D \u2192 [0, 1]d , by considering composition\nof generalized flows with \u03a6 one can easily constructs a generalized flow with finite action between\nany h0 , h1 \u2208 SDiff(D). Moreover, standard compactness/lower semicontinuity arguments in the\nspace P(\u03a9(D)) provide existence of generalized flows with minimal action.\n\n2.1\n\nEulerian-Lagrangian model\n\nComing back to the relaxed model described above, we observe that the endpoint constraint (e0 , e1 )# \u03b7 =\n(i \u00d7 h)# \u03bcD cannot be modified to deal with the more general problem of connecting f \u2208 S(D) to\nh \u2208 S(D): indeed, by right invariance, this is clear only if f is invertible (in this case, one looks\nfor the optimal connection between i and h \u25e6 f \u22121 ). These remarks led to a more general model,\nwhich allows to connect \u03b7 = \u03b7a \u2297 \u03bcD to \u03b3 = \u03b3a \u2297 \u03bcD [2]. (Here we are disintegrating both the\ninitial and final plan with respect to the first variable.) The idea, which appears first in Brenier's\nEulerian-Lagrangian model [8] is to \"double\" the state space, adding to the Eulerian state space\nD a Lagrangian state space A. Even though A could be thought as an identical copy of D, it is\nconvenient to denote it by a different symbol.\nLet\n\u03a9\u2217 (D) := \u03a9(D) \u00d7 A.\nThen, consider probability measures \u03b7 = \u03b7a \u2297 \u03bcD in \u03a9\u2217 (D): this means that \u03b7 has \u03bcD as second\nmarginal, and that\n\u0013\nZ\nZ \u0012Z\n\u03c6(\u03c9, a) d\u03b7(\u03c9, a) =\n\u03c6(\u03c9, a) d\u03b7 a d\u03bcD (a)\nA\n\nfor all bounded Borel functions \u03c6 on \u03a9\u2217 (D).\nAgain, one minimizes the action\nZ\nA (\u03b7) :=\n\n\u03a9\u2217 (D)\n\n\u03a9(D)\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\n|\u03c9\u0307|2 dt d\u03b7(\u03c9, a)\n\nwith the incompressibility constraint (et )# \u03b7 = \u03bcD for all t (here et (\u03c9, a) = \u03c9(t)) and the family of\nendpoint constraints:\n(e0 )# \u03b7 a = \u03b3a ,\n\n(e1 )# \u03b7 a = \u03b7a\n\nfor \u03bcD -a.e a \u2208 D.\n\nAs in the previous section, we are using \u03b7a \u2297 \u03bcD and \u03b3a \u2297 \u03bcD to denote the disintegrations of \u03b7 and\n\u03b3 respectively.\nDenoting by \u03b4(\u03b7, \u03b3)2 the minimal action, it turns out that one can define natural operations of\nreparameterization, restriction and concatenation in this class of flows. These imply that (\u03b4, \u0393(D))\nis a metric space.\nIndeed, it is proved in [1] that it is complete and a length space, whose convergence is stronger\nthan weak convergence in P(D \u00d7 D).\n\n2.2\n\nMotivation for the extension to \u0393(D)\n\nEven for deterministic initial and final data, there exist examples of minimizing geodesics \u03b7 that are\nnot deterministic in between: this means that (e0 , et )# \u03b7 \u2208 \u0393(D) \\ S(D), t \u2208 (0, 1).\nTo show this phenomenon, consider the problem of connectingup to additive constants in D =\nB1 (0) \u2282 R2 the identity map i to \u2212i. For convenience, up to a reparameterization, we can choose\nthe time interval as [0, \u03c0]. Two classical solutions are\n[0, \u03c0] \u220b t 7\u2192 (x1 cos \u00b1t + x2 sin \u00b1t, x1 sin \u00b1t + x2 cos \u00b1t),\n5\n\n\fcorresponding to a clockwise and an anti-clockwise rotation.\nOn the other hand, one can consider the family of maps \u03c9x,\u03b8 connecting x to \u2212x\np\n\u03b8 \u2208 (0, \u03c0)\n(4)\n\u03c9x,\u03b8 (t) := x cos t + 1 \u2212 |x|2 (cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8) sin t\n\u0001\nand define \u03b7 := (\u03c9x,\u03b8 )\u266f 2\u03c01 2 L 2 \u230aD \u00d7 L 1 \u230a(0, 2\u03c0) .\nIt turns out that \u03b7 is optimal as well, and non-deterministic in between. Moreover, as shown\nin [4], it is possible to construct infinitely many other solutions to the above minimization problem\n\u0001\nwhich are not induced by maps. For instance, one can split the measure \u03b7 above as 21 \u03b7 + + \u03b7 \u2212 ,\nwhere \u03b7 + consists of the curves such that (cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8) * x\u22a5 \u2265 0, and \u03b7 \u2212 consists of the curves such\nthat (cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8) * x\u22a5 \u2264 0, where x\u22a5 = (x2 , \u2212x1 ), and the two flows \u03b7 + and \u03b7 \u2212 can be shown to\nbe still incompressible (see [4, Paragraph 4.1]). We will say more about these important examples\nlater on, as more results on the theory will be available.\n\n3\n\nThe pressure field\n\nBrenier proved in [7] a surprising result: even though geodesics are not unique in general, given the\ninitial and final conditions, there is a unique, up to an additive time-dependent constant, pressure\nfield. The pressure field arises if one relaxes the incompressibility constraint, considering almost\nincompressible flows \u03bd. Denoting by \u03c1\u03bd the density produced by the flow, defined by\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nZ\n\u03c6\u03c1\u03bd (t, *) d\u03bcD for all \u03c6 ,\ni.e.\n\u03c6(\u03c9(t)) d\u03b7(\u03c9) =\n(et )# \u03bd = \u03c1\u03bd (t, *)\u03bcD\nD\n\nwe say that \u03bd is almost incompressible if k\u03c1\u03bd \u2212 1kC 1 \u2264 1/2.\nTheorem 3.1 (Pressure as a Lagrange multiplier, [7, 1]) Let \u03b7 be optimal between \u03b7 and \u03b3.\nThere exists a distribution p \u2208 (C 1 )\u2217 such that\nA (\u03bd) + hp, \u03c1\u03bd \u2212 1i \u2265 A (\u03b7)\n\n(5)\n\nfor all almost incompressible flows \u03bd between \u03b7 and \u03b3 with \u03c1\u03bd (t, *) = 1 for t sufficiently close to 0\nand to 1.\nUsing this result one can make first variations as follows: given a smooth field w(t, x), vanishing\nfor t close to 0 and 1, one can consider the family (X t ) of flow maps\nd t\nX (\u03b5, x) = w(t, X t (\u03b5, x)),\nd\u03b5\n\nX t (0, x) = x\n\nand perturb (smoothly) the paths \u03c9 by \u03c9(t) 7\u2192 X t (\u03b5, \u03c9(t)) \u223c \u03c9(t) + \u03b5 w(t, \u03c9(t)). Denoting by\n\u0001\n\u03a6\u03b5 : \u03a9\u2217 (D) \u2192 \u03a9\u2217 (D),\n\u03a6\u03b5 (\u03c9, a)(t) := X t (\u03b5, \u03c9(t)), a ,\n\nthe induced perturbations in \u03a9\u2217 (D), these in turn induce perturbations \u03b7 \u03b5 := (\u03a6\u03b5 )# \u03b7 of \u03b7 which\nare almost incompressible. Then, the first variation gives\nZ\nZ 1\nd\n\u03c9\u0307(t) * w(t, \u03c9(t)) dt d\u03b7(\u03c9, a) + hp, div wi = 0.\ndt\n\u2217\n\u03a9 (D) 0\nThis equation uniquely determines \u2207p as a distribution, independently of the chosen minimizer \u03b7:\nindeed, \u03b7 enters in (5) only through A (\u03b7), which obviously is independent of the chosen minimizer,\n\n6\n\n\fand so the above equation holds true for every minimizer \u03b7. Since w is arbitrary, the first variation\nalso leads to a weak formulation of Euler's equations\n\u2202t v t (x) + div (v \u2297 v t (x)) + \u2207x p(t, x) = 0,\nwhere v t and v \u2297 v t are implicitly defined by\nv t \u03bcD = (et )# (\u03c9\u0307(t)\u03b7),\n\nv \u2297 v t \u03bcD = (et )# (\u03c9\u0307(t) \u2297 \u03c9\u0307(t)\u03b7).\n\nObserve that in general v \u2297 v t 6= v t \u2297 v t . Indeed, since these models allow the passage of many fluid\npaths at the same point at the same time (i.e. branching and multiple velocities are possible), the\nproduct v t (x) \u2297 v t (x) of the mean velocity v t (x) with itself might be quite different from the mean\nvalue v \u2297 v t (x) of the product. This gap precisely marks the difference between genuine distributional solutions to Euler's equation and \"generalized\" ones (see also [4, Section 2 and Paragraph 4.4]\nfor more comments on this fact).\n\n4\n\nNecessary and sufficient optimality conditions\n\nIn this section we study necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for Brenier's variational problem and its extensions.\nR\nThe basic remark is that any Borel integrable function q : [0, 1] \u00d7 D \u2192 R with D q(t, *) d\u03bcD = 0\nfor every t \u2208 [0, 1] induces a null-lagrangian for the minimization problem, with the incompressibility\nconstraint: indeed\nZ\nZ 1\nZ 1Z\nq(t, \u03c9(t)) dt d\u03b7(\u03c9, a) =\nq(t, x) d\u03bcD (x) dt = 0\n\u03a9\u2217 (D)\n\n0\n\n0\n\nD\n\nfor any generalized incompressible flow \u03b7. If we denote by\n\u001b\n\u001aZ 1\n1\n2\n0,1\n|\u03c9\u0307(t)| \u2212 q(t, \u03c9(t)) dt : \u03c9(0) = x, \u03c9(1) = y\ncq (x, y) := inf\n0 2\nR\nthe value function for the Lagrangian Lq (\u03c9) := 12 |\u03c9\u0307(t)|2 \u2212 q(t, \u03c9(t)) dt, we also have\nZ\n\n\u03a9\u2217 (D)\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n|\u03c9\u0307(t)|2 \u2212 q(t, \u03c9(t)) dt d\u03b7(\u03c9, a) \u2265\n2\n\nZ\n\nD\n\nc0,1\nq (a, h(a)) d\u03bcD (a)\n\nfor any incompressible flow \u03b7 between i and h. Moreover, equality holds if and only if \u03b7-almost\nevery (\u03c9, a) is a c0,1\nq -minimizing path.\nThe following result, proved in [8, Section 3.6], shows that this lower bound is sharp with q = p,\nif p is sufficiently smooth.\nTheorem 4.1 Let u be a C 1 solution to the Euler equations in [0, T ] \u00d7 D, whose pressure field p\nsatisfies\n(\u2217)\n\nT 2 sup\n\nsup\n\nh\u22072x p(t, x)\u03be, \u03bei \u2264 \u03c0 2 .\n\nt\u2208[0,T ] x\u2208D, |\u03be|\u22641\n\nThen the measure \u03b7 induced by u via the flow map is optimal on [0, T ].\nThis follows by the fact that the integral paths of u satisfy \u03c9\u0308(t) = \u2212\u2207p(t, \u03c9(t)), and (\u2217) implies\nthat stationary paths for the action are also minimal for Lp . (This is a consequence of the one\nRT\n2 RT\ndimensional Poincar\u00e9 inequality 0 |u\u0307(t)|2 dt \u2265 T\u03c0 2 0 |u(t)|2 dt for all u : [0, T ] \u2192 R such that\nRT\n0 u dt = 0, see [5, Section 5] or [8, Proposition 3.2] for more details.)\n7\n\n\fThe question investigated in [1] is: how far are these conditions from being necessary? C 1\nregularity or even one sided bounds on \u22072 p are not realistic, so one has to look for necessary (and\nsufficient) conditions under much weaker regularity assumptions on p.\nFrom now on, we restrict for simplicity to the case D = Td . The following regularity result\u0001\nfor the pressure field has been obtained in [2], improving the regularity \u2207p \u2208 Mloc (0, 1) \u00d7 Td\nobtained in [8].\nTheorem 4.2 For \u0001any \u03b3, \u03b7 \u2208 \u0393(Td ) the unique pressure field given by Theorem 3.1 belongs to\nL2loc (0, 1); BV (Td ) .\n\nThe above result says in particular that p is a function, and not just a distribution. This allows\nto define the value of p pointwise, which as we will see below will play a key role.\nIn order to guess the right optimality conditions, we recall that the two main degrees of freedom\nin optimal transport problems are:\n\u2022 In moving mass from x to y, the path, or the family of paths, that should be followed;\n\u2022 The amount of mass that should be moved, on each such path, from x to y.\nThe second degree of freedom is even more important in situations when more than one optimal\npath between x and y is available. As we will see, both things will depend on Lp . But, since p is\ndefined only up to negligible sets, the value of the Lagrangian Lp on a path \u03c9 is not invariant in the\nLebesgue equivalence class; furthermore, no local pointwise bounds on p are available (remember\nthat p(t, *) is only a BV function, with BV norm in L2loc (0, 1)). Therefore, as done in [1], one has\nto:\n\u2022 Define a precise representative p\u0304 in the Lebesgue equivalence class of p; it turns out that the\n\"correct\" definition is\np\u0304(t, x) := lim inf p(t, *) \u2217 \u03c6\u03b5 (x),\n\u03b5\u21930\n\nwhere p(t, *) \u2217 \u03c6\u03b5 are suitable mollifications of p(t, *). Of course this definition depends on the choice\nof the mollifiers, but we prove that a suitable choice of them provides a well-behaved (in the sense\nstated in Theorem 4.3 below) function p\u0304.\n\u2022 Consider, in the minimization problem, only paths \u03c9 satisfying\nM p(t, \u03c9(t)) \u2208 L1loc (0, 1),\nwhere M p(t, *) is a suitable maximal function of p(t, *) (see [1] for a more precise definition of the\nmaximal operator).\nWith these constraints one can talk of locally minimizing path \u03c9 for the Lagrangian Lp\u0304 and,\ncorrespondingly, define a family of value functions\nd\nd\ncs,t\np\u0304 : T \u00d7 T \u2192 [\u2212\u221e, +\u221e],\n\n[s, t] \u2282 (0, 1),\n\nrepresenting the cost of the minimal connection between x and y in the time interval (s, t):\ncs,t\np\u0304 (x, y)\n\n:= inf\n\n\u001aZ\n\ns\n\nt\n\n1\n|\u03c9\u0307(\u03c4 )|2 \u2212 p\u0304(\u03c4, \u03c9) d\u03c4 :\n2\n\u001b\n\u03c9(s) = x, \u03c9(t) = y, M p(\u03c4, \u03c9(\u03c4 )) \u2208 L (s, t) .\n1\n\nWith this notation, the following result proved in [1] provides necessary and sufficient optimality\nconditions.\nTheorem 4.3 Let \u03b7 = \u03b7 a \u2297 \u03bcT be an optimal incompressible flow between \u03b7 = \u03b7a \u2297 \u03bcT and \u03b3 =\n\u03b3a \u2297 \u03bcT . Then\n8\n\n\f(i) \u03b7 is concentrated on locally minimizing paths for Lp\u0304 ;\n\n(ii) for all intervals [s, t] \u2282 (0, T ), for \u03bcT -a.e. a, the plan (es , et )# \u03b7 a is cs,t\np\u0304 -optimal, i.e.\nZ\nZ\ncs,t\ncs,t\n(x,\ny)\nd(e\n,\ne\n)\n\u03b7\n\u2264\ns\nt\n#\np\u0304 (x, y) d\u03bb\np\u0304\na\nTd \u00d7Td\n\nTd \u00d7Td\n\nfor any \u03bb \u2208 P(Td \u00d7 Td ) having the same marginals of (es , et )# \u03b7a .\n\u0001\nConversely, if (i), (ii) hold with p\u0304 replaced by some function q satisfying M q \u2208 L1loc (0, 1); L1 (Td ) ,\nthen \u03b7 is optimal, and q is the pressure field.\nNotice that an optimal transport problem is trivial if either the initial or the final measure is a\nDirac mass; therefore the second condition becomes meaningful when either (es )# \u03b7 a or (et )# \u03b7a is\nnot a Dirac mass: it corresponds to the case when (es , \u03c0a )# \u03b7 is not induced by a map, a phenomenon\nthat cannot be ruled out, as we discussed in Section 2.2. In the example presented in Section 2.2\nthe pressure field p(x) = |x|2 /2 is smooth and time-independent, but the initial and final conditions\nare chosen in such a way that a continuum of action-minimizing paths (4) between x and \u2212x exists.\nAs shown in [4], there are infinitely many incompressible flows connecting the identity map i to \u2212i,\nwhich moreover induce infinitely many distributional solutions to the Euler equations [4, Paragraph\n4.4].\nThe results in [1] show a connection with the theory of action-minimizing measures, though in\nR1\nthis case the Lagrangian 0 12 |\u03c9\u0307(t)|2 \u2212 p\u0304(t, \u03c9(t)) dt is possibly non-smooth and not given a priori,\nbut generated by the variational problem itself.\nHere we see a nice variation on a classical theme of Calculus of Variations: a field of (smooth,\nnonintersecting) extremals gives rise both to minimizers and to an incompressible flow in phase\nspace. Here, instead, we have a field of (possibly nonsmooth, or intersecting) minimizers which has\nto produce an incompressible flow in the state space. This structure seems to be rigid, and it might\nlead to new regularity results for the pressure field.\nLet us also recall that, as recently shown in [11], under a W 1,p -regularity of the pressure p one\ncan show that \u03b7-a.e. \u03c9 solves the Euler-Lagrange equations and belongs to W 2,p ([0, 1]) \u2282 C 1 ([0, 1]).\nThis result is a first step towards the BV case, where one can still expect that the minimality of \u03b7\nmay allow to prove higher regularity on the minimizing curves \u03c9 (like \u03c9\u0307 \u2208 BV ).\n\nReferences\n[1] L.Ambrosio and A.Figalli, Geodesics in the space of measure-preserving maps and plans, Arch.\nRation.
