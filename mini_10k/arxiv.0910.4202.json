But current status\nof the model in parameter space different from close-to\u039bCDM has been unclear. The distance-redshift relation,\nthe age of the universe, abundances of light elements,\nthe large-scale matter density and velocity power spectrum, the CMB temperature and polarization anisotropy\npower spectra, and the perturbation growth factor can be\nregarded as the main pillars of modern cosmology where\ntheories meet with observations. Here, we investigate the\nunified model by comparing realistic theoretical predictions with currently available observations. Our conclusions can be found in section IV.\n\np\u0303X = \u2212A\u03bc\u0303\u2212\u03b1\nX ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere p\u0303 and \u03bc\u0303 are the pressure and the energy density,\nand A and \u03b1 are constants; tildes indicate covariant quantities. The Chaplygin gas is a case with \u03b1 = 1. It is interesting to note that any fluid with barotropic equation\nof state, p\u0303X = p\u0303X (\u03bc\u0303X ), has an exact scalar field theory\ncounterpart with a tachyonic kinetic term given by an\naction (we set 8\u03c0G \u2261 1 \u2261 c)\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\nR 2dp\u0303X\np\n1\n4\nS = d x \u2212g\u0303 R\u0303 + p\u0303X (X\u0303) , X\u0303 \u221d e \u03bc\u0303X +p\u0303X , (2)\n2\nwhere X\u0303 \u2261 12 \u03c6\u0303,c \u03c6\u0303,c ; see Appendix A for a proof.

The equation of state\n\n\f2\nparameter wX is negligible in the early era thus the\nGCG potentially acts as a dark matter, and approaches\nwX0 = \u2212A/\u03bc1+\u03b1\nX0 (> \u22121) in recent past thus it potentially acts as a dark energy depending on suitable choice\nof parameters.\nWe consider a flat background with baryon, radiation\n(photons and neutrinos), and the GCG. At the present\nepoch the Friedmann equation gives\n\u03a9X0 = 1 \u2212 \u03a9b0 \u2212 \u03a9r0 ,\n\n13.7 Gyrs\n13.5 Gyrs (right)\n13.9 Gyrs (left)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03a9i \u2261 \u03bci /\u03bccrit with \u03bccrit the critical density. Thus,\n\u03bcX0 is completely fixed by the Friedmann equation.\nEquation (4) gives\nA = \u2212wX0 \u03bc1+\u03b1\nX0 .\n\n(6)\n\nAs A is determined by wX0 and \u03b1, in the following we\nwill regard wX0 and \u03b1 as the two free parameters to be\nconstrained by comparing the theoretical consequences\nwith observations.\nThe \u039bCDM limit can be reached by taking \u03b1 = 0, and\nidentifying A = \u03bc\u039b = \u039b and \u03bcc0 = \u03bcX0 \u2212 A; \u03bcc indicates\ndensity of the CDM. Thus, in a flat background, from\nEqs. (5) and (6) we have\nwX0 = \u2212\n\n\u03a9\u039b0\n\u03a9\u039b0\n=\u2212\n.\n\u03a9X0\n\u03a9\u039b0 + \u03a9c0\n\n(7)\n\nWe can show that even linear perturbation system (i.e.,\nequations for \u03b4c and vc ) also coincides exactly with the\n\u039bCDM case. As a fiducial model, we use flat \u039bCDM\nmodel consistent with Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy\nProbe (WMAP) 5-year data [41] (\u03a9b0 = 0.0456, \u03a9c0 =\n0.2284, \u03a9\u039b0 = 0.726, h = 0.705, ns = 0.960, \u03c38 = 0.812,\nT0 = 2.725 K, YHe = 0.24, and N\u03bd = 3.04), but\nwithout reionization history, see [42]. Thus we have\nwX0 = \u22120.7607.\nIn Fig. 1 we present the likelihood contours in \u03b1-wX0\nplane based on the SNIa data. Also presented are the\nage lines. Notice that the likelihood contour as well as\nthe age lines depend on \u03a9b0 in our GCG model. It is\ninteresting to see that, except for small region close to\nthe \u039bCDM, most of the 1\u03c3 region based on SNIa can\nbe ruled out by applying age of the universe larger than\n13.5 Gyrs. Notice that the SNIa alone favors \u03b1 = 0.9971\nand wX0 = \u22120.8523 (indicated by a bullet) which will be\ncompletely excluded by the matter and the CMB power\nspectra (see Fig. 3) and also by the age limit. Background\nevolutions for the locations indicated by \u22c6 in this Figure\nare presented in Fig. 2. Perturbation power spectra and\nthe growth factors for the same parameters are presented\nin Figs. 3 and 4.\nWe consider scalar-type perturbations. For a fluid with\nbarotropic equation of state we naturally have\n\u03b4pX = c2X \u03b4\u03bcX ,\n\n(8)\n\nwithout the entropic perturbation. This relation is valid\nwithout taking any gauge condition. As the anisotropic\n\nFIG. 1: Likelihood (1-3\u03c3) contours in \u03b1-wX0 plane based\non the SNIa Union sample [43].

Short-and-longdashed lines are age lines in the unit of (h/0.705)\u22121 Gyrs.\nThe age lines together with the SNIa data already show that\nparameters with \u03b1 > 0 are largely excluded by currently\navailable observations. A short-dashed line shows parameters which reach c2X0 = 1 at the present epoch; the right side\nof the line has c2X0 > 1 thus becoming super-luminal.\n\nstress also vanishes the GCG is exactly an ideal fluid.\nAlthough the fluid definition of the GCG model is ambiguous about the ideal fluid nature, this can be proved\nby the field theoretic counterpart based on Eq. (2); see\nAppendix A for the proof.

The binned SNIa data\nare based on the Union sample [43].\n\nwe solve a system composed of baryon, radiation (handled using the Boltzmann equation or tight coupling approximation), together with the GCG described by Eqs.\n(9) and (10) representing the dark matter and the dark\nenergy in a unified way. We consider a flat background\nwith similar parameters as our fiducial \u039bCDM model\nmentioned below Eq. (7) including neutrino components.\nOur set of equations and the numerical methods are presented in [45].\nWe solved the system in three different gauge conditions: the synchronous gauge (SG), the uniformexpansion gauge (UEG), and the uniform-curvature\ngauge (UCG); see [42, 47, 48] for the description of the\ngauges. The matter power spectrum and the perturbation growth factor are for the baryonic matter perturbation in the synchronous gauge which is a gauge-invariant\nconcept in our situation. The CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies are naturally gauge invariant. The\nfinal results of these gauge-invariant variables calculated\nin our three different gauge conditions should coincide;\nthis provides a numerical check of the calculations.\nIn Figs. 2 and 3 we present the background evolu-\n\nFIG. 3: The matter (baryon) power spectrum (top-left), and\nCMB TT (top-right), EE (bottom-left), TE (bottom-right)\npower spectra of GCG models with parameters used in Fig.\n2, and the same colored code. All calculations are made in\nthree different gauge conditions (SG, UEG, and UCG), and\nthe results in the three gauges coincide exactly. The matter and CMB power spectra of the \u039bCDM model have been\nnormalized with \u03c38 and COBE spectrum, respectively. For\ncomparison, all the GCG power spectra have been normalized with the \u039bCDM ones at k = 0.01 h Mpc\u22121 for matter\npower spectrum and l = 700 for CMB ones. The ratios of\nGCG powers to \u039bCDM predictions are also shown in the bottom region of top panels. For matter and CMB TT power\nspectra, recent measurements from SDSS DR7 Luminous Red\nGalaxies (LRG) [46] and WMAP 5-year [41] data (including\nthe cosmic variance) have been added (grey dots with error\nbars) together with fractional errors of observed spectra. For\na correct comparison with the LRG band powers, the model\npower spectrum should include the convolution effect caused\nby LRG band power window functions and the non-linear\nclustering information.\n\ntion, and the matter and the CMB power spectra for\nseveral typical parameters indicated as \u22c6 in Fig. 1. The\nbottom-right panel in Fig. 2 shows that all the parameters we consider fit well with the SNIa data. However,\nthe power spectra in Fig. 3 show that all the GCG models we consider fail to fit the observed matter and CMB\npower spectra simultaneously. The baryon density perturbation growth factor presented in Fig. 4 also confirms\nthis result.\nThus, we find that the only region in \u03b1-wX0 parameter\nspace allowed by the current observations is the location\nclose to \u039bCDM. In order to constrain the observationally\nallowed variation of \u03b1 in that region, in Figs. 5 and 6\nwe investigate the case of \u221210\u22125 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 10\u22122 for fixed\nwX0 = \u22120.7607.

For the parameters considered the CMB power\nspectra are similar to the \u039bCDM, thus observationally indistinguishable for \u03b1 < 10\u22122 . The matter power spectra\nin Fig. 5, however, depend more sensitively on the value\nof \u03b1. For example, for \u03b1 > 10\u22124 the current observation\ncan be used to distinguish its deviation. The baryon density perturbation growth factor presented in Fig. 6 also\nconfirms this result which shows that the deviations are\n\n+11.3\n\u22125.98\u22122.19\n\u22120.25+5.78\n\u22125.76\n\nwX0\n\u00d7 10\n\n\u22120.756+0.023\n\u22120.016\n\n\u00d7 10\n\n\u22120.7585+0.0035\n\u22120.0030\n\n\u22125\n\u22126\n\nparticularly significant in the small scale.\nBased on severe oscillations and divergent behaviors in\nthe small scale of GCG power spectrum for nonvanishing\n\u03b1, authors of [22] concluded that |\u03b1| larger than 10\u22125\nare excluded by the observation. This is understandable\nbecause the sound velocity squared c2X becomes negative/positive, thus causing instability/oscillation for negative/positive \u03b1 in the small-scale limit, see Appendix\nB for the analysis. However, later it has been shown\nthat, despite the heavy oscillation and divergence of the\nGCG power spectrum, the accompanied baryon power\nspectrum behaves relatively well [8, 38]. In order to resolve the issue clearly, in Fig. 7 we present the baryon\npower spectra together with the GCG power spectra for\nthe same parameters used in Fig. 5. The Figure confirms that despite the wild oscillations and divergences\nof GCG power spectra, the baryon power spectra behave\nmuch mildly. The Figure shows, however, that although\n|\u03b1| \u223c 10\u22125 are surely acceptable, \u03b1 \u223c 10\u22124 gives deviation compared with current observation and \u03b1 \u223c 10\u22123\ncould be already excluded. For negative value of \u03b1 we\nhave more stringent limit so that \u03b1 < \u22125.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 already shows diverging behavior in the small scale limit.\nIn Figs. 5-7 we show that near \u03b1 = 0 (thus for GCG\nmodels close to \u039bCDM) the observed matter power spectrum can be used to constrain tightly the allowed GCG\nmodels, whereas the CMB power spectra are relatively\n\n\f5\n\nFIG. 7: The baryonic matter power spectrum in Fig. 5,\ntogether with the GCG power spectrum plotted in dashed\nlines. Although the baryon power spectra are normalized at\nk = 0.01 h Mpc\u22121 , the GCG power spectra are normalized at\nk = 0.001 h Mpc\u22121 due to heavy oscillation of the latter ones.\nCompared with the GCG power spectra which oscillate significantly, baryon power spectra relatively behave mildly. The\ngrey and blue dots with error bars represent the SDSS DR7\nLRG and the \u039bCDM mock power spectrum data, respectively.\nFor the latter, we define 50 data points in the logarithmic interval between 0.02 and 0.3 hMpc\u22121 , and perturb the linear\n\u039bCDM matter power spectrum at each point by adding a\nGaussian noise with 10% of the power spectrum amplitude as\nstandard deviation. This \u039bCDM-motivated mock data will\nbe used to constrain our GCG model in Fig. 8 and Table I.\n\nsimilar to \u039bCDM. In Fig. 8 we show the likelihood contours of GCG model parameters obtained from the SDSS\nDR7 LRG and \u039bCDM-motivated mock power spectrum\ndata in Fig. 7 (see Appendix C for the method). Table I\nlists 68.3% confidence limits (CL) of GCG model parameters estimated based on likelihood distribution around\nthe narrow region close to \u039bCDM model (inner panel of\nFig. 8). Although not favored in the age constraint, we\nfind another (besides the close-to-\u039bCDM) region in the\n\u03b1-wX0 parameter plane where the matter power spectra\nare favored by current observations. In Fig. 9 we show the\nmatter and the CMB power spectra for several parameters within 1\u03c3 domain in the matter power spectrum in\nFig. 8. Authors of [38] showed that for large \u03b1 with wX0\nextremely close to \u22121 the matter power spectra are compatible with observation; this is consistent with our Fig.\n8 (note that the truncation of contour at \u03b1 \u2243 4.6 is due\nto the finite bin size of wX0 used in the GCG model parameter search). However, our Fig. 9 shows that despite\nthe observational success in the matter power spectra,\nsignificant deviations in the CMB power spectra are unavoidable, thus this additional domain is excluded by the\n\nFIG. 8: Likelihood (1-3\u03c3) contours in \u03b1-wX0 plane based on\nthe matter power spectrum measurements from SDSS DR7\nLRG [46] (red, yellow, green curves). For the method used,\nsee Appendix C. Notice that besides the region around \u039bCDM\nnear \u03b1 = 0 (see the inner panel), the matter power spectrum\nfavors another island with positive \u03b1. This island, however,\ncan be excluded by the CMB power spectra in Fig. 9 and\nthe age limit in Fig. 1. In the both panels, we add similar\nconstraint based on \u039bCDM-motivated mock power spectrum\ndata in Fig. 7 (blue contours). GCG model parameters used\nin Figs. 2-4 are indicated by \u22c6; power spectra for several parameters consistent with LRG power spectrum indicated by\n+ are presented in Fig. 9.\n\nFIG. 9: The same as in Fig. 3 for parameters indicated.\nWe present parameters which show similar behavior as the\n\u039bCDM in the matter power spectra. All these models, however, show severe deviations in the CMB power spectra, thus\nare excluded.\n\n\f6\nwhere the fluid quantities are defined in Eq. (2) of [50].\nFrom \u03bc\u0303X = \u2212p\u0303X + 2p\u0303X,X X\u0303 we can derive\n\nCMB observations (in addition to the age test).\n\nIV.\n\nX\u0303 \u221d e\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe have systematically studied observational consequences of GCG unified dark matter and dark energy\nmodel. In the background Friedmann world model the\nbasic requirement of minimum age of the universe together with the SNIa luminosity-redshift data already\nleaves only small parameter space close to the \u039bCDM\nmodel, see Fig. 1. In the perturbation study, we have\nshown that the matter power spectrum and the CMB\npower spectra are mutually exclusive except for narrow\nregion close to the \u039bCDM model, see Figs. 3, 5, and 9.\nA tight constraint on \u03b1-parameter in that allowed region can be obtained from the (baryonic) matter power\nspectrum as \u22125 \u00d7 10\u22125 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 10\u22124 , see Figs. 5 and\n7. More realistic constraint can be found in Fig. 8 and\nTable I as |\u03b1| . 10\u22124 from the SDSS DR7 LRG power\nspectrum and |\u03b1| . 10\u22125 from the \u039bCDM mock power\nspectrum data. Although this allowed region is wider\nthan what was concluded based on the GCG power spectrum in [22] (see Fig. 7), the constraint based on the\nbaryon power spectrum is still severe enough so that the\nobservationally allowed GCG model can be regarded as\nextremely close to the \u039bCDM model, thus, effectively indistinguishable from the \u039bCDM model. Although named\nas a unified model the GCG model has two free parameters, \u03b1 and wX0 , whereas the \u039bCDM has only one free\nparameter \u03a9\u039b0 . From the perspective of more wider parameter space of our GCG model, it is remarkable to\nnotice the distinguished success and its uniqueness of the\n\u039bCDM model.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nH.N. was supported by grants No. 2009-0078118 from\nKorea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).\nJ.H. was supported by the Korea Research Foundation (KRF) Grant funded by the Korean Government (MOEHRD, Basic Research Promotion Fund) (No.\nKRF-2007-313-C00322) (KRF-2008-341-C00022), and by\nGrant No. R17-2008-001-01001-0 from KOSEF.\n\nAppendices\n\nAppendix A.

To the background order, we have\nc2X \u2261 \u1e57X /\u03bc\u0307X = pX,X /\u03bcX,X . To the perturbed order, we\nhave \u03b4pX = pX,X \u03b4X and \u03b4\u03bcX = \u03bcX,X \u03b4X, thus eX \u2261\n\u03b4pX \u2212 c2X \u03b4\u03bcX = 0. As we have eX = 0 and \u03c0Xab = 0, the\ntachyonic field based on Eq. (2) corresponds to an ideal\nfluid.\nAppendix B. Small-scale instability for \u03b1 < 0:\nFor \u03b1 < 0 we have c2X < 0. As the GCG is an ideal\nfluid cX can be interpreted as the sound velocity, and\nimaginary sound speed naturally leads to small scale instability. In order to show the instability we take the\nGCG-comoving gauge which sets vX \u2261 0. Together with\nthe Raychaudhury equation (see Eq.

We note that\nthe above equation is generally valid in the presence of\nother components (baryon, radiation, etc.) and the background curvature. The presence of c2X k 2 \u03b4X term in the\nright-hand-side of above equation shows that for negative/positive c2X we have strong pressure-caused instability/oscillation in the small scale limit where k is large.\nAppendix C. Likelihood estimation of GCG\nmodel parameters using the matter power spectrum data: Here we briefly summarize how the likelihood contours of GCG model parameters in Fig. 8\nhave been obtained from the observed and mock power\nspectrum data. The power spectrum measured from\nSDSS DR7 LRG sample has been released recently [46],\nwith 45 band power measurements at comoving scales\nk = 0.0221\u20130.199 hMpc\u22121 , corresponding band-power\nwindow functions, and inverse covariance matrix between\nmeasurement errors. For each GCG model of \u03b1-wX0 ,\nwe obtain 45 data points by convolving the linear baryonic matter power spectrum with the band-power window functions and normalize the point at the largest\n\n\f7\nscale (k = 0.0221 hMpc\u22121 ) to that of (convolved) fiducial \u039bCDM model power spectrum based on the WMAP\n5-year observation. Then we estimate the GCG model\n2\nprobability distribution L \u221d e\u2212\u03c7 /2 on \u03b1-wX0 plane by\nscanning \u03c72 = dT C\u22121 d, where d is a 45 \u00d7 1 vector containing GCG powers relative to LRG measurement and\nC is the 45 \u00d7 45 covariance matrix. During the scanning, other cosmological parameters have been fixed. By\nadding extremely large noise on the diagonal components\nof covariance matrix corresponding to k > 0.1 hMpc\u22121\n\nscales, we have effectively excluded LRG power spectrum\ninformation at scales where non-linear clustering dominates. Notice that during the analysis we have completely ignored non-linear clustering properties of the\nmatter power spectrum, and thus have not derived the\nhalo power spectrum to compare with measured LRG\npower spectrum. For the case of \u039bCDM-motivated mock\npower spectrum data (Fig. 8), similar analysis has been\ndone but without convolution operations.\n\n[1] A.U. Kamenshchik, U. Moschella, and V.
