Granular materials differ from all the other materials: they can flow\nlike liquids under some conditions and act as solids under others [1, 2, 3]. Their intrinsic complexity is consequence of\nthe fact that they are composed of many pieces (the grains) that can assemble in large structures behaving collectively.\nThe study of granular materials has forced scientists to rethink established classifications of matter and to reformulate\nstatistical mechanics in a new context. These studies are springing out new ideas that are advancing the understanding\nof large classes of complex materials from composites to foams.\nThe question whether a statistical mechanics approach can correctly describe granular systems has sparkled an\nintense debate in the scientific community in recent years [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22].\nSuch a statistical mechanics theory of granular matter must be able to connect the observable behavior of large\naggregates with the structural and dynamical properties of the grains constituting these systems. The great interest\nin such 'thermodynamical' theory of granular packings resides in the fact that it would lead to a description of such\na complex system in terms of a few relevant parameters only [7, 8, 9, 13, 15]. This is in analogy with traditional\nthermodynamics, where the state of a large system comprised of many interacting elements can be completely described\nby knowing temperature, volume or pressure.\nIn this paper we show that such approach is formally possible: a statistical mechanics formulation for granular matter\ncan be built deductively from a small set of physical assumptions and the equivalent of the Maxwell-Boltzmann's\ndistribution can be formally derived. More significantly, we show that such a distribution describes very accurately\nempirical and numerical data concerning volume distributions in sphere packings prepared with several different\nmethods in a broad range of packing fractions.\nOne of the characteristics that differentiate granular materials from molecular materials is that frictional forces\namong grains can dissipate energy and drive the system towards frozen, jammed configurations. Because of such\nenergy dissipation, granular materials can change their static configurations only when energy is injected in the\nsystem. This can be done in several ways, for instance by tapping the system with vertical vibrations or by pulsing\nfluids flows in fluidised beds or by shearing or by rotating the container. The relevant fact is that such action should\nmake possible for the system to change configuration and explore the accessible phase-space.\nThe statistical mechanics approach proposed in this paper is built within the same framework of the deductive\nfoundation of statistical mechanics proposed by O. Penrose in [23]. The present paper is structured as follows. In\nSection II, we introduce the general idea of the system's observational states and the probability of transition between\nstates when the system is driven by trains of energy injections. In Section III, we define a microscopic 'fine grained'\ndescription of system's state concerning grain packs at static equilibrium. In this section we also discuss other possible\n'coarse grained' macroscopic descriptions and the links between these different descriptions. A classification of states\nin terms of their transitional probabilities is proposed in Section IV where the concept of ergodic set is also introduced.\nIn Section V, we discuss the statistical equilibrium. The system entropy is defined in Section VI where a maximumentropy prediction for the probability of a given (coarse-grained) state is also introduced. The readers that are only\ninterested on the theoretical outcomes might skip all the previous sections and jump directly to Section VII where\n\n\f2\nthe probability density function for the system's volume fluctuations is calculated. In Section VIII, the concept of\n'granular temperature' and the links with volume fluctuations at equilibrium are discussed. In Section IX, it is shown\nthat the theoretical predictions for the probability density function for local volumes at the grain levels (Vorono\u0131\u0308\ncells) reproduce extremely well experimental and simulation data. Moreover, we show that the theory predicts also\nthe global fluctuations on the scale of the whole system. The signatures of transitions occurring at the random\nloose packing limit and at the random close packing limit are highlighted by studying the changes occurring at these\ndensities in a quantity (k) which is shown to be the analogous to the specific heat for these systems. Conclusions and\nperspectives are given in Section X.\nII.\n\nOBSERVATIONAL PROBABILITY AND TRANSITION BETWEEN STATES\n\nLet us here consider a granular system that evolves by means of repeated energy injections. We are interested in\nthe system's state observed in between trains of energy injections when all the grains are at rest in a stable static\nconfiguration. Let us use the term 'trials' to indicate such energy injection trains. Let us define Pt (\u03a8 \u2190 \u03a80 ) as the\nprobability to find the system in the observational state \u03a8 after an experiment consisting of t trials, given that at\nthe beginning of the experiment (t = 0) the system was prepared in the state \u03a80 . We will return on the definition of\nthe observational state in the next section. In this section we assume that the system static state can be defined and\nencoded.\nA further important assumption is that the system is Markovian [23]: the current observational state embodies\nall the observational information about the past history of the system that are relevant to its future observational\nstate. Such assumption allows usP\nto write the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation describing the evolution under energy\ninjections [23]: Pt+1 (\u03a8 \u2190 \u03a80 ) = \u03a81 P1 (\u03a8 \u2190 \u03a81 )Pt (\u03a81 \u2190 \u03a80 ); which can be re-written in the more familiar form\np(\u03a8, t + 1) =\n\nX\n\u03a81\n\nw(\u03a8 \u2190 \u03a81 )p(\u03a81 , t) ;\n\n(1)\n\nwhere w(\u03a8 \u2190 \u03a81 ) = P1 (\u03a8 \u2190 \u03a81 ) is the probability of transition between the state \u03a81 to the state \u03a8 by performing\none trial on the system. Whereas, p(\u03a81 , t) is a simplified notation for Pt (\u03a81 , \u03a80 ) with the initial state omitted.\nThe Markovian assumption is quite strong from a statistical point of view. However, in the context we are investigating, this assuption is adequate. Indeed, a granular system at rest in a static stable configuration can stay\n'frozen' in such a state for ever. Such a state might depend on all the system past history, the Markovian hypothesis\nsimply assumes that all the relevant information which will determine the system future evolution is contained in the\nproperties of the present system's state. Indeed, there are no simple mechanisms to store 'hidden' information about\nthe granular system which are not embodied into the complete microscopic description of the system at rest. It must\nbe noted that, on the contrary, a coarse-grained description of the system's state might classify as identical states\nwith different microscopic properties. Although belonging to the same coarse-grained classification, such states are\ndistinct at microscopic level and might evolve with different transition probabilities.\nIII.\n\nDEFINITION OF THE SYSTEM'S STATE\n\nThe aim of this section is to show with a practical example that it is formally possible to precisely encode the system's\nmicroscopic state. Granular materials are made of several grains which are typically confined in a container. Each\ngrain 'i' in the system can have a different shape (si ) and a different mass (mi ). The geometrical disposition of each\ngrain can be characterized by the coordinates of its barycenter ri = (xi , yi , zi ) and the grain orientation oi = (\u03b8i , \u03c6i ).\nIf we assume that: 1) the grains are non-deformable objects but they can overlap; 2) the grains interact only when\nthey are in contact or they are overlapping; 3) the interaction energy is a known function of the grain overlaps; then,\nit is possible to give a complete description of the observable state of a packing of N grains at rest in a stable static\nconfiguration by providing the set of positions and orientations of all grains: \u03a8 = {r1 , r2 , ..., rN , o1 , o2 , ..., oN }.\nHowever, when friction is present, the tangential frictional force between two grains is a function of the relative\npath that has produced such static configuration [24]. Such dependence on the previous history would falsify the\nMarkovian assumption if we adopt the previous classification for \u03a8. On the other hand, we can solve this apparent\ndifficulty by including the set of tangential forces between grains into the microscopic description. In this way all the\ninformation about the relevant past history is encoded in the preset state description. The future evolution depends\nonly on the present state and the trials. The theory satisfies therefore the Markovian assumption. Such an encoding\nis for instance used in numerical simulations of granular systems such as the Discrete Element Method (DEM) with\n'soft' spheres [25, 26, 27].\n\n\f3\nIndependently on the details of the system and on its specific encoding, the previous example has shown a very\nimportant fact: the system microscopic state can be completely encoded in terms of a finite set of quantities. However,\nwe must consider that there are several possible descriptions of the system's state and the use of different variables\nmight be more appropriate in different systems. For instance, it can be convenient to include in the local description\nof the packing also some information about the surrounding configuration. To this purpose one can subdivide the\npacking into a set of k local 'elementary cells'. Such cells can be viewed as the portions of space associated to local\nconfigurations in the granular pack. If we call c the properties of such cells (size, shape, volume, connectivity, center of\nmass, orientation, etc.), then the system's state can be conveniently classified in terms of the properties of such local\n'elementary cells': \u03a8 = {c1 , c2 , ..., ck }. Let us note that the two descriptions in terms of positions and orientations\nor in terms of local cells must be equivalent and interchangeable. The complete information about the system's\nconfiguration is encoded in both the representations. In the following we will refer to the state \u03a8 as a 'microscopic'\nstate.\nThe classification in terms of the microscopic state \u03a8 is the most complete description of the system's static\nconfiguration. However, in most of the practical cases such a 'fine grained' description is neither necessary nor useful.\nThere are indeed several different microscopic configurations that share the same macroscopic physical properties.\nA 'coarse grained' description of the system's state can be therefore more useful, and practical, when one wants to\nassociate structural properties to physical properties. An example of a macroscopic \u2013 coarse grained \u2013 description of\nthe system's state is its classification in terms of the total volume V occupied by the system (or equivalently in terms\nof the packing fraction, volume of the grains / V). Certainly, there is a very large number of microscopic states \u03a8\nwhich correspond to the same volume V . Nonetheless, there are several structural and physical properties of these\nsystems that can be unambiguously classified in terms of the packing fraction only [28]. The possibility to construct\na coherent framework which allows one to consistently describe the system at different levels of detail is one of the\nmain features of statistical mechanics [23]. A statistical mechanics theory of granular material should provide the\ninstruments to unambiguously describe the average system properties and their probability distributions at any chosen\nlevel of description.\nIV.\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF SYSTEM'S STATES\n\nThe system's states can be classified in terms of their transitional probabilities [23]. In particular, a state \u03a6 is\ntransient if there exists a state \u03a8 that the system can reach from \u03a6 but it cannot go back to \u03a6. If the state is\nnot transient it is said to be persistent. The set Z(\u03a6) of all states that can be reached from a persistent state \u03a6\nis called ergodic set. Persistent states may be separated into one or more distinct ergodic sets. Once the system\nreaches a persistent state it will remain in the ergodic set containing such state and it will repeatedly visit all the\nstates in the set never going outside. For large t the system will eventually reach\nP the limit probability distribution\np(\u03a8, t \u2192 \u221e) = p\u221e (\u03a8), that is the solution of the system of equations p\u221e (\u03a6) = \u03a8 w(\u03a6 \u2190 \u03a8)p\u221e (\u03a8). Note that such\nlimiting probability is stationary in the sense that it is not dependent on t. A system which is confined in an ergodic\nset Z and visits the states \u03a8 \u2208 Z with frequencies proportional to p\u221e (\u03a8) is said to be at statistical equilibrium.\nWe note that such transitional probabilities, which define the classification of states and ultimately the system's\nstatistical equilibrium, are intrinsically dependent on the kind of trials we are performing on the system. Therefore,\nthe equilibrium state and even the ergodic set are not solely associated with the kind of system in exam. Conversely,\nthey are uniquely associated to the combination of both system properties (grain shapes, roughness, friction, container\nshape, ... ) and the kind of trial (tapping, fluid flow, pouring, rotating, ...) and its properties (vibration frequency\nand amplitude, fluid intensity, pouring height, rotation velocity,...).\nThese classifications of the system's states and all the transition properties and evolution relations (Eq. 1) discussed\nin this section and in the previous one, can be applied also to coarse grained states, providing that they satisfy the\nMarkovian assumption. It is of some interest to note that a coarse grained state A can be at the statistical equilibrium\neven if the microscopic states haven't reached equilibrium yet.\nV.\n\nSTATISTICAL EQUILIBRIUM\n\nWe have already introduced in the previous section the definition of statistical equilibrium. This is a very important\nconcept that must be discussed with some care. In a molecular gas, statistical equilibrium is reached after a certain\ntime when the system has achieved a homogeneous internal temperature and it has thermalized to the surrounding\nenvironment. In the context of granular materials and in particular in tapping experiments, the 'equilibrium' state\nis typically considered reached when, after a certain number of tappings with a given intensity, the packing fraction\nbegins to oscillate around a constant value that is independent from the starting state. Such an heuristic definition is\n\n\f4\nconsistent with the formal one given in the previous section, however there can be cases when more than one ergodic\nset can be reached from the same starting configuration. Each one of such ergodic sets can have different statistical\nequilibrium properties.\nIt must be noted that the definition of statistical equilibrium is intrinsically associated with the transitional probability and therefore with the kind of trial that we are repeatedly performing on the system, it is not a property of\nthe system's static configuration. In this sense it is misleading to think that statistical equilibrium can be reached\nby means of certain prescribed operations only (such as tapping or fluid flows). On the contrary there are a very\nlarge number of actions (trials) that will drive the system toward equilibrium. For instance, if we pour grains from a\nvessel into another and we do it several times being careful to repeat the operation each time in the same way (same\nheight, inclination angle,...) we will eventually reach a situation in which the static packing configurations have stable\nstatistical properties. Analogously, statistical equilibrium can be achieved by rotating the container or by blowing\nair from below or by stirring the aggregate or by several other possible manipulations. The open question is whether\nthese 'equilibrium' states are the same states or not. They might have the same average packing fraction but, to\ncoincide they must also belong to the same ergodic set. Generally speaking, it is quite unlikely that exactly the same\nregions of the phase-space are explored by means of operations as different as fluidized beds or pouring. However,\nwe will show in Section IX that there are evidences of remarkable universal properties that hold across very diverse\npreparation methods and different numerical simulations. Such universality is suggesting that there might be a very\nlarge class of processes that leads to the same ergodic set or to sets that are mostly overlapping.\nVI.\n\nMAXIMUM ENTROPY PREDICTION FOR THE STATE PROBABILITIES\n\nThere are several different definitions of Entropy that can be applied to different contexts such as thermodynamics\nof molecular gasses or information theory. In this paper we will use the 'statistical entropy' (or Gibbs entropy) S(Z)\nwhich is better suited to be applied to the study of the ensemble of states Z constituting the ergodic set:\nX\nX\nS(Z) = \u2212\np\u221e (A) log p\u221e (A) +\np\u221e (A)S(A) .\n(2)\nA\u2208Z\n\nA\u2208Z\n\nHere the state A is a given 'coarse grained' description of the system; p\u221e (A)Pis its \u2013 stationary \u2013 probability within\nthe ergodic set Z and S(A) is the entropy of the state A, which is: S(A) = \u2212 \u03a8\u2208A q(\u03a8) log q(\u03a8), where q(\u03a8) are the\na-priori probabilities to find the system in the microscopic state \u03a8 \u2208 A. When all the microscopic states are a-priori\nequi-probable, the expression for S(A) becomes\nS(A) = log \u03a9(A) ,\n\n(3)\n\nwith \u03a9(A) the number of microscopic states which are classifiable under the same coarse grained state A. Eqs.2 and\n3 give a coherent definition of the system's entropy independently on the level of details at which the system's states\nare described. In general, the choice for the tuning of the system's description depends on our experimental capability\nof measuring the structural properties, and on our analytical or computational ability to evaluate the number of\nmicroscopic configurations which are contributing to such states. For what concerns the a-priori probabilities q(\u03a8),\nin the following we will assume that, a-priori, the probabilities to find the system in any given microscopic state are\nall equal and therefore we will use Eq.3. This is not an essential assumption for the present theory, however this is\nthe most likely scenario for a granular system prepared by means of some random mixing operation.\nLet us adopt characterize the system's state in terms only of its total occupied volume V (i.e. A = V ). Different\nexperiments can result in granular packings with different total occupied volume V . For instance, in the classical\nexperiment by [29, 30, 31], different average packing fractions are obtained by driving the system with different\ntapping intensities. Here we are interested in the properties of the ergodic set, which is the set of all the possible total\nvolumes which can be reached by means of the chosen system's handling. The probability of each of such realizations\nis p\u221e (V ). The ergodic set at statistical equilibrium is characterized by the average volume V\u0304 (or equivalently the\naverage packing fraction \u03c1\u0304) and the study of the statistical properties of the ergodic set coincides with the study of\nthe volume fluctuations around such average values.\nThe most important property of entropy is that it is a non decreasing function, therefore at the statistical equilibrium\nthe entropy must reach its maximum. We can calculate p\u221e (V ) by searching for the functional form of the probability\ndistribution function which maximizes the entropy S(Z) (Eq.2). Such maximization must be done under the condition\nthat the average occupied volume is equal to V\u0304 , which is the characteristic average volume associated to the ergodic\nset Z corresponding to the specific trial. This yields to:\n\u03a9(V )e\u2212V /\u03c7\n,\n\u2032 \u2212V \u2032 /\u03c7\nV \u2032 \u03a9(V )e\n\np\u221e (V ) = P\n\n(4)\n\n\f5\nwith \u03c7\u22121 a Lagrange multiplier fixed by the constraint on the average volume:\nX\nV\u0304 = hV i =\nV p\u221e (V ) .\n\n(5)\n\nV\n\nEq.4 is the \u2013 almost unavoidable \u2013 outcome of any statistical mechanics theory. The challenge is now to compute the\nnumber of microscopic states \u03a9(V ) associated with coarse-grained states which occupy a total volume V . To this end\nwe must introduce some further assumptions as discussed in the next section.\nVII.\n\nSPACE PARTITIONS\n\nThe phase-space volume \u03a9(A) is the number of microscopic states which are classifiable under the same coarse\ngrained state A. Specifically, \u03a9(V ) is associated with all the microscopic configurations \u03a6 = {c1 , c2 , ..., ck } occupying\na total volume V . Let us assume that all the cell-properties ci are either completely determined by their volumes vi\nor they are independent from vi . Let us also assume that these cells can have arbitrary volumes above the minimum\nvalue vmin , under the sole condition that the whole system must occupy a total volume V . In this case, the volume\nof the accessible phase-space can be computed exactly:\n\u03a9(V ) =\n\n1\n\u039b3k\n\nZ\n\nV\n\ndv1\n\nvmin\n\nZ\n\nV\n\ndv2 ....\n\nvmin\n\nZ\n\nV\n\nvmin\n\ndvk \u03b4(v1 + v2 + ... + vk \u2212 V ) =\n\n(V \u2212 kvmin )k\u22121\n\u039b3k (k \u2212 1)!\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nwith \u039b a constant analogous to the Debye length. Substituting into Eq.4, and by using Eq.5 we obtain \u03c7 = (V\u0304 \u2212\nkvmin )/k and the probability\n\u0013\n\u0012\nV \u2212 Vmin\nk k (V \u2212 Vmin )(k\u22121)\nexp \u2212k\np\u221e (V ) = f (V, k) =\n\u0393(k) (V\u0304 \u2212 Vmin )k\nV\u0304 \u2212 Vmin\n\n,\n\n(7)\n\nwith Vmin = kvmin . The function f (V, k) is the probability density function to find a packing of k elementary cells\noccupying a volume V , in a set of experiments where the average occupied volume is V\u0304 . In a previous paper we\nreported a different derivation of f (V, k) from simple statistical arguments [32]. Note that Eq.6 is valid for any k\nand it holds even in the limit k = 1. Indeed, the observable system can be any arbitrary sub-set of a larger system.\nMoreover, the experiment can be performed either on several different independent systems or \u2013 equivalently \u2013 on\nseveral non-interacting sub-sets of a large system. Eq.7 is a Gamma distribution in the variable V \u2212 Vmin ; it is\ncharacterized by a 'shape' parameter k and a 'scale' parameter (V\u0304 \u2212 Vmin )/k [33]. In the literature empirical fits\nwith gamma distributions have been previously reported for two-dimensional Vorono\u0131\u0308 networks [34], and for Vorono\u0131\u0308\npartitions from random Poisson points in three dimensions [35]. Interestingly the same distribution has been observed\nin statistical study of crumpled paper [36].\nThe average volume from the distribution f (V, k) coincides with V\u0304 and the variance is\n\u03c3v2 =\n\n(V\u0304 \u2212 Vmin )2\n,\nk\n\n(8)\n\nwhich is a useful relation to empirically evaluate k from a set of volume measurements: k = (V\u0304 \u2212 Vmin )2 /\u03c3v2 . We will\nmake use of this relation in Section IX.\nVIII.\n\nTHE 'DEGREES' OF SPACE PARTITION\n\nFollowing Edward's ideas [4, 37], a 'granular temperature' can be inferred from an analogy with the thermodynamical\nrelation \u03b2 = 1/(kB T ) = \u2202(Entropy)/\u2202(Energy) [4, 37], by susbstituting the volume to the role played by the energy\nin thermodynamical systems. In the formalism of this paper this can be written as: \u03b2gr = \u03c7\u22121 = \u2202S(Z)/\u2202 V\u0304 . From\nEquations 2 and 6 we have:\n\u22121\n\u03b2gr\n=\u03c7=\n\nV\u0304 \u2212 Vmin\nk\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\ntherefore the Edwards' compactivity \u03c7 [4, 37] is the average free-volume per elementary cell, implying that the\n'granular temperature' is a measure of the kind and the degree of space-partition into elementary cells. For a given\n\n\f6\nsystem at a given packing fraction, the 'granular temperature' is univocally associated to the quantity k. By using\nEqs.8 and 9 we have\n\u03c7=\n\n\u03c3v2\nV\u0304 \u2212 Vmin\n\n.\n\n(10)\n\nThe present theory provides therefore a very effective and practical way to compute Edward's compactivity from\nmeasures of volume fluctuations.\nIn terms of the compactivity \u03c7 the expression for the cell-volumes' distribution (Eq.7 ) can be written in the more\ncompact form\np\u221e (V ) =\n\n\u03a9(V ) \u2212 V\u03c7\ne\n\u03a9(\u03c7)\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\nwhich recalls the equivalent expression in classical thermodynamics, with \u03a9(V ) given by Eq.6 and \u03a9(\u03c7) =\n\u03a90 \u03c7k exp(\u2212Vmin /\u03c7). The volume fluctuations within the ergodic set can be directly calculated from Eq.7 and one\ncan verify that the correct relation between compactivity and fluctuations is attained:\n\u03c72\n\n\u2202 hV i\n= (V \u2212 hV i)2\n\u2202\u03c7\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nFrom this equation, substituting Eqs. 8 and 9, we obtain the following relation for the quantity k:\nk=\n\n\u2202 hV i\n,\n\u2202\u03c7\n\n(13)\n\nk measures therefore the amount of volume that must be added to the system in order to increase of one 'granular\ndegree' the compactivity. The analogous quantity for molecular gasses is: \u2202Energy/\u2202T emperature, which is the\nspecific heat. In analogy with ordinary thermodynamics this 'specific heat' is expected to be sensitive to changes in\nthe system's internal properties. Ultimately, k counts the number of elementary cells, it is therefore a measure of the\nnumber of degrees of freedom.\nIn this section we have shown that the present theory is consistent with all the equilibrium requirements in an\nordinary statistical mechanics approach such as the molecular gas thermodynamics. Pushing forwards such analogy\nwe can see that if the compactivity is the analogous of the temperature in a thermodynamics system, then Eq.7 must\ncorrespond to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for granular systems.\nIX.\n\nTHEORY VALIDATION: VORONO\u00cf VOLUME DISTRIBUTION\n\nWe have tested the validity of the present theory over a set of packings generated by means of a modified\nLubachevsky-Stillinger algorithm [38, 39, 40]. The algorithm starts from random points in space and it makes them\nuniformly grow into non-overallping hard spheres with the sphere positions evolving in time according to Newtonian\ndynamics. The algorithm uses a cubic box and periodic boundary conditions. The simulation is ended when a jammed\nstate with diverging collision rate is reached. Large expansion rates produce jammed configurations at low packing\nfractions whereas slower growth rates lead to larger packing fractions. For very slow rates, crystalline nuclei with large\npacking fractions are formed. In our simulations we used 10000 spheres with unitary diameters obtaining jammed\nconfigurations with packing fractions between 0.56 and 0.65 by varying the growth rate between 500 and 0.000001.\nWe also generated non-jammed configurations in the range of packing fractions between 0.1 and 0.55 by keeping the\ngrowth rate at 0.001 and arresting the simulation once the desired packing fraction was reached. We also compare the\ntheoretical predictions with experimental results concerning both acrylic beads in air and glass beads in water from\nthe ANU database on disordered packings [41]. Details on these experimental systems are reported in [28, 32, 42].\nWithin the framework of the present theoretical approach the packings generated by means of numerical simulations\ncan be considered as prepared with a 'single trial'. The ergodic set for the jammed packings can be identified with the\nset of all configurations that can be achieved with a given growth rate. For the non-jammed packing configurations\nthe ergodic set can be identified with the ensemble of non-overalpping spheres at a given packing fraction. In the case\nof dry acrylic and glass beads experiments the ergodic set is the set of all mechanically stable packings achievable with\nthe specific preparation action [43]. Finally, we point out that, in the case of the glass beads in water, the preparation\nby means of a fluidized bed technique was specifically tuned with a sufficiently large number of repeated flows to\nensure that the stationary state was reached [32]. The fact that in all the above systems the statistical equilibrium is\n\n\f7\nreached is a 'working hypothesis' that will be supported, later in this section, by the very good agreement between\nthe observations and the theoretical (equilibrium) predictions.\nEquation 7 is the main outcome of the present theory and it can be directly tested on the observations from\nexperiments and computer simulations. The distribution f (V, k) predicted by Eq. 7 is valid for any aggregate of k\nelementary cells. Therefore, the same equation must describe both the volume fluctuations at the level of a single\ngrain as well as the fluctuation at the level of the whole system.\nA.\n\nLocal volume fluctuations\n\nLet us first study the system at local level investigating the volume fluctuations at the level of a single grain. For this\npurpose we must first implement a method to assign a portion of volume associated to each grain in the packing. A\nnatural way to divide space into cells 'warped' around each grain is the Vorono\u0131\u0308 partition where cells are associated to\nthe portion of space closest to a grain center respect to any other centre in the packing. Such a partition is particularly\nmeaningful in the case of packing of equal spheres because in this case the Vorono\u0131\u0308 cell is always circumscribing the\ninternal sphere. Extension to grains with more generic shapes and sizes can be implemented.\nFigure 1 shows the resulting distribution of the Vorono\u0131\u0308 volumes. One can see that such distributions span a very\nbroad interval of volumes between 0.69 and 12 with large differences between different samples. Lines in Fig.1 are\nthe plots of f (V, k) (Eq.7) with the parameter k calculated from k = (V\u0304 \u2212 Vmin )2 /\u03c3v2 (Eq.8). One can see that all\nthe distributions follow well the theoretical prediction. However, given the broad and different domains in which\nsuch distributions are defined, a better visualization of such agreement in necessary. This can be obtained by an\nappropriate shift and rescaling of the variable. Indeed, from Eq. 7, one can see that distributions characterized by\nsimilar values of k must result into similar behaviors when plotted as function of (V \u2212 Vmin )/(V\u0304 \u2212 Vmin ). Figure 2\nshows the plot of all the distributions in function of such shifted-rescaled variable. We note that all the distributions\nfrom jammed configurations (bottom figure) collapse into very similar behaviors well described by f (V, k) with k\nin the range between 12.2 and 14.5. Un-jammed configurations (top figure) also reveal very good agreement with\nf (V, k) but in this case the parameter k spans a larger interval (9 \u2264 k \u2264 25). We also note that the distribution with\ncrystalline inclusions (\u00d7 symbols) deviates slightly from the predicted behavior of f (V, k) revealing the emergence of\na second peak at small volumes (corresponding to the close-packed crystalline inclusions).\nThe numerical results analyzed in the previous paragraph refer to rather 'ideal' packings made of non overlapping\nidentical spheres. Remarkably, the same good agreement with f (V, k) (Eq.7) was also found [32] in real experimental\nsystems of acrylic spheres in air [28, 32, 42, 43, 44] and glass spheres in water [32] packed at different packing fractions\nby following different preparation protocols. Figure 3 shows that all the experimental distributions and the jammed\nconfigurations obtained numerically in the present work, collapse into very similar behaviors well described by f (V, k)\nwith k in a narrow range around k \u223c 12. We note that, the probability distribution function is well reproduced in\nall the range of volumes; over eighteen different experimental systems; over eight different computer simulations; over\na range of packing fractions between 0.55 to 0.64 and with a statistics performed over more than one million local\nconfigurations.\nThe impressive fact of such an agreement is that these systems are very different (ideal Newtonian spheres, acrylic\nbeads in air and glass beads in water) and they are prepared in very different ways (pouring, tapping, fluid flows,\nmolecular dynamics shearing). The collapse of all these distributions around f (V, k \u223c 12) suggests that there are\nuniversal properties that determine the packing configurations which are very little sensitive to the preparation\nmethod. Interestingly, we observe that un-jammed configurations are also very well described by f (V, k) but with\nparameters k which are different from the one of the jammed case. Figure 4 reports the estimates for the parameter\nk calculated from the relation k = (V\u0304 \u2212 Vmin )2 /\u03c3v2 (Eq.8). The value at zero packing fraction (k = 5.586) was\ncalculated analytically for random Poisson points in three dimensions [35, 45]. Figure 4 shows that, for non jammed\nconfigurations, the value of k increases almost linearly by increasing the packing fraction. Then the value of the\nparameter k collapses around 12 when the system gets into a jammed configuration. The inset in the figure shows\nthat there are sizable differences between different systems and between the same system at different packing fractions.\nA careful look shows a rather neat variation in the value of k for the experimental systems around the packing fraction\n\u03c1 \u223c 0.6. Special properties associated to the global volume fluctuations at \u03c1 \u223c 0.6 was also observed in fluidized bed\nexperiments by Schr\u00f6ter et al. [16]. Above the packing fraction \u223c 0.645, the packings generate partially crystallized\nregions and the change in the kind of structural organization is reveled by a sharp drop in the value of k that eventually\nwill tend to zero in the crystalline limit. We observe that the distribution f (V, k) (Eq. 7) with k \u223c 12 is also followed\nby the Vorono\u0131\u0308 volumes from simulations of granular packings reported in [46]. An equivalent collapse for a complete\ndifferent system concerning for simulations of a polymer melt, water, and silica was reported by by Starr [47] where\nvolume distributions were plotted vs. (v \u2212 hvi)/\u03c3\u221a\nv . It is straightforward to see that such a scaling coincides to the\none proposed in this paper, indeed (v \u2212 hvi)/\u03c3 = k((v \u2212 vmin )/(hvi \u2212 vmin ) \u2212 1).

Let us now verify if the present theory can also correctly predict the volume\nfluctuations at the level of the whole sample. This requires the analysis of the distribution of the volumes of large\nnumber of equivalent samples made by means of the same procedure. Differently from the single-grain case here we\ncan only study jammed configurations. We have prepared such samples by using the modified Lubachevsky-Stillinger\nalgorithm [38, 39, 40] generating a large number of jammed packings containing different numbers of grains (between\nN = 200 to N = 10000) and prepared at different growth rates (between 0.0005 and 1000). For each growth rate and\nsize we run at least 200 independent simulations and we measure the total volume occupied by the jammed spheres.\nThree examples of the resulting statistical distributions of volumes are shown in Fig.5. Again we find that Eq.7 predicts\nextremely well the observed fluctuations. The agreement is obtained without using any adjustable parameter. Indeed,\n\n\f11\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online). Behavior of k calculated from k = (V\u0304 \u2212 Vmin )2 /\u03c3v2 (Eq.8) vs. packing fraction \u03c1. This plot refers to the statistics\non local configurations computed over the fluctuations of the Vorono\u0131\u0308 cells volumes. Neat changes in k are observed when spheres first\njam (\u03c1 \u223c 0.55) and when crystalline nuclei start to form (\u03c1 > 0.65). The '+' refers to simulations of un-jammed packings of spheres; the\n'\u25e6' are jammed packings simulated by using different growth rates and '\u00d7 is a jammed sample with crystalline inclusions; the symbols '\u22b2'\ncorrespond to 12 experiments with glass spheres in water prepared by means of fluidized beds technique [32] ; finally, the 6 symbols '\u22b3,\n\u0003, \u22c6, \u22c4, \u25b3, \u25bd' refer to 6 experiments with acrylic beads in air prepared by means of different methods [28, 42, 43, 44].\n2\n\nto calculate the parameter k we compute the average volume hV i = V\u0304 , the variance \u03c3v2 = V 2 \u2212 hV i and we use\nk = (V\u0304 \u2212 Vmin )2 /\u03c3v2 (Eq.8). In this case, Vmin is fixed to the minimum volume attainable by a packing\n\u221a of N equal\nspheres with unit diameter, which is the volume occupied by a fcc crystalline configuration: i.e. N/ 2 (for spheres\nwith unitary diameters).\nOne can note that the distribution tends to narrowing during compaction. The quantity k is changing with the\npacking fraction and, for example, in the three examples in Fig.5 we measure: k = 2.6N at \u03c1 = 0.564, k = 4.4N\nat \u03c1 = 0.616 and k = 8.8N at \u03c1 = 0.637. More generally we compute the average volume and the variance for a\nvery large set of data over a range of packing fractions within 0.55 and 0.66. The resulting values of the parameter\nk rescaled by the number of spheres in each sample N are plotted in Fig.6. We note that the data from samples\nwith various sizes (between N = 200 to N = 10000) all fall on similar values when rescaled by N indicating that the\nparameter k scales linearly with the number of spheres. The rescaled parameter k/N takes values a little below 3 at\nthe loose packing limit (\u03c1 \u223c 0.55). Then the value of the parameter grows consistently when the packing densifies\nand it reaches a peak at the random close packing limit \u03c1 \u223c 0.64. Afterwards, k/N drops sharply and eventually goes\nto zero when the packing becomes crystalline. The small samples with 200 spheres show a slightly different behavior\nwith the peak occurring before \u03c1 \u223c 0.64. We verified that this is a finite-size effect due to the formation of some\npoly-crystalline samples.\nIt is therefore clear that the quantity k is very sensitive to the changes in the system's internal structure and the peak\nat the random close packing limit indicates that the packing must reorganize in order to proceed with compaction.

However, the values of the local quantity (k) and the rescaled global quantity (k/N ) are\ndifferent. This should not be of any surprise. Indeed, k counts the number of elementary cells contributing to the\nsystem's volume. But, some elementary cells are sheared among neighboring Vorono\u0131\u0308 cells, and therefore the number\nthat contributes to the volume of N Vorono\u0131\u0308 cells is not necessary N times the number that contributes to one single\ncell. Furthermore, it is known that volume-correlations play an important and unusual role in these systems [48]. It\nhas been shown both in computer simulations and experiments [48, 49, 50] that the scaling of the volume fluctuations\nis not a simple linear function of the portion of sample investigated and there are evidences of a dependence on the\npreparation procedure and on the packing fraction. Although not surprising, such different values and behaviors of\nthe local and global k have important implications. For instance this implies that the granular temperature measured\nat local level is different from the one measured from the global fluctuations. In this respect the 'proper' granular\ntemperature is the one associated to the global volume fluctuations which we have shown is an intensive quantity since\nk is scaling linearly with N (at least for samples with more than 200 spheres, Fig.6). The 'temperature' associated\nwith the local measure of k is an 'effective granular temperature'. The fact that they predict so accurately the volume\nfluctuations both at local and at global level indicates that the effect of correlations and local geometrical constraints\ncan be treated within a statistical mechanics framework by simply tuning the value of k.\n\n\f13\n\nFIG. 6: (Color online). The parameter k divided by the number of spheres in the sample (N ) is plotted versus the average packing\nfraction \u03c1\u0304 = \u03c0/(6V\u0304 ) for several samples with total number of spheres between 200 and 10000. The value of k is computed from k/N =\n1/N (V\u0304 \u2212Vmin )/\u03c3v2 = ( 6\u03c0\u03c1\u0304 \u2212 \u221a1 )2 /\u03c3v2 over a large set of samples prepared by repeating a large number of simulations using the same growth\n2\nrate for each average packing fraction. The full line is a guide for eyes showing the sharp transition occurring around 0.645 for samples\nwith N \u2265 700, the dotted line highlights that small samples (N = 200) start the decay at smaller packing fractions around \u03c1 \u2243 0.635.\n\nX.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have shown that a statistical mechanics theory for granular matter can be always deductively\nconstructed from two simple physical assumptions: 1) the microscopic system's structure can be completely described\nin terms of a finite set of quantities; 2) after performing a given experiment, the probability to find the system in a\ncertain static state depends only on the previous state (and on the experiment itself). These two simple assumptions\nlead to a complete statistical mechanics description for these systems where both transient and equilibrium properties\ncan be treated. We show that an expression for the volume fluctuations can be explicitly obtained (Eq.4) by introducing\nthe following three additional assumptions: i) the microscopic state can be encoded in terms of the properties of a\nset of local cells with volumes vi ; ii) the cells properties are either fully described by their volumes vi or\nP they are\nindependent from vi ; iii) any space partition with cells of volumes vi \u2265 vmin satisfying the condition i vi = V\ncorresponds to an attainable packing. A comparison with a large number of experiments and computer simulations\nshows remarkably good agreements with the theoretical predictions in a wide range of packing fractions and for several\ndifferently-prepared systems (Section IX and Figs. 1, 2 and 3).\nWe have identified a quantity, k, which is very sensitive to the system's structural organization. It results that such\nquantity is the equivalent of the specific heat in ordinary thermodynamics. We have demonstrated that k can be easily\ncomputed empirically (Eq.8) by measuring the average volume and the variance in a set of trials. A large number of\nmeasures from both the local statistics at the level of the single grain and at the global level of the whole sample show\nthe signatures of clear structural transitions marked by peaks and discontinuities in the values of k occurring at both\nthe random loose packing and at the random close packing limits (Figs.4 and 6). Similar peaks in the specific heat\n\n\f14\nare observed at phase transitions in thermodynamic systems. Understanding whether proper thermodynamical phase\ntransitions are occurring at the he random loose packing limit and the random close packing limit is the subject of\ncurrent investigations.\nWe have demonstrated that the present theory can predict both the volume fluctuation at the level of a single grain\n(Vorono\u0131\u0308 cells) and at the level of the whole system (see Figs. 3 and 5). The remarkable quantitative agreement\nbetween theory, experiments and simulations at both local and global levels is very encouraging demonstrating that\nstatistical mechanics is a powerful tool to study and predict the properties of complex materials. We have discussed\nthat the local effects of correlations and geometrical constraints can be taken into account by using an 'effective'\nlocal granular temperature. Further work must be devoted to better understand the link between local and global\nproperties and identify the length-scale above which the system becomes extensive. An important test to establish the\ncorrect granular temperature might use an independent measure from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem as discussed\nin [5, 7]. The use of non extensive forms of entropy instead of the classical Gibb's entropy might be right approach to\nformulate a theory which consistently describes both local and global levels in terms of a unified generalized granular\ntemperature.\nAcknowledgements\n\nMany thanks to Enrico Scalas who has first pointed out the relevance of the Penrose's approach to complex systems.\nWe thank Antonio Coniglio, Mario Nicodemi, Massimo Pica Ciamarra, Matthias Schr\u00f6ter and Harry Swinney for\nhelpful discussions.
