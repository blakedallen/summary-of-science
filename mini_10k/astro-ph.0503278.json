These oscillations are due to high-overtone p-mode pulsations, and appear as\nrapid periodic photometric variations in B and V filters of the Johnson broadband photometric system. Periods of oscillations are in the range 4\u201316 min., and photometric variations\nexhibit low amplitudes. They are independent on photometric variations caused by the\nstellar rotation.\n1\n\nSpecial Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Nizhnij Arkhyz, 369167 Russia\n\n2\n\nWarsaw University Observatory, Al. Ujazdowskie 4, 00-478 Warsaw, Poland\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nRapidly oscillating Ap-stars are often refered to as roAp-stars, and this class presently\ncontains 32 stars (Kurtz & Martinez 2000).\nSearch for rapid variations of the radial velocity in \u03b3 Equ (HD 201601, A9p SrCrEu, V =\n4.7 mag) was initialized by Bychkov (1987, 1988). Paper by Zverko et al. (1989) reported\nthe search for a rapid variability of its magnetic field and radial velocity. All these early\ninvestigations used the photometric technique of observations, and did not yield conclusive\nresults due to low accuracy. Recently, Kochukhov & Ryabchikova (2001) performed similar\nresearch using modern equipment, and have obtained reliable phase variations of the radial\nvelocity in \u03b3 Equ.\nRecently some research groups attempted to observe rapid variations of its magnetic\nfield. Particularly interesting is a possible variability of the magnetic field with the pulsation\nperiod of \u03b3 Equ. Leone & Kurtz (2003) reported a discovery of rapid variations of the stellar\nlongitudinal (effective) magnetic field Be with a period of 12.1 min., and the amplitude\nequal to 240 \u00b1 37 G. In a later communication Savanov et al. (2003) have found variations\nof the magnetic field modulus with the period 12.53 min. with the amplitude 99 \u00b1 53 G.\nThe authors reported in their paper variability of a separation between the resolved Zeeman\ncomponents of the Fe II 6149.2 A line.\nOn the other hand, Kochukhov et al. (2004a) reported the absence of variations of the\nlongitudinal magnetic field Be in \u03b3 Equ, which directly contradicts earlier claims by Leone\n& Kurtz (2003). Kochukhov et al. (2004a) obtained a series of 210 spectropolarimetric\nobservations with a high time resolution, and found no Be variations with amplitudes above\n40 \u2212 60 G in the circularly polarized components of 13 Nd III lines. Such a limit represents\ntheir 3\u03c3 confidence level. Moreover, Kochukhov et al. (2004b) have shown that possible\nvariations of the surface magnetic field in \u03b3 Equ do not exceed 5 \u2212 10 G in short time scales\n(observations in Fe II 6149.25 and Fe I 6173.34 lines).\nRecently Hubrig et al. (2004) concluded a search for rapid variability of the longitudinal\nBe field in several magnetic stars (observations in circularly polarized profiles of hydrogen\nlines). Unfortunately, their results on \u03b3 Equ are not conclusive due to a small number of Be\npoints.\nThis paper presents results of our search for rapid periodic variations of the longitudinal\nBe field in \u03b3 Equ. We have performed Fourier spectral analysis of archival time series of 1720\nBe continuous measurements in the search for periods. Individual Be points were measured\nwith a very fine time resolution (\u2248 6 seconds on the average).\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n2.\n\nObservations and data analysis\n2.1.\n\nInstrumentation\n\nWe used the hydrogen line polarimeter (Bychkov et al. 1988; Shtol' 1991, 1993) for\nmeasurements of the longitudinal stellar magnetic field Be . The polarimeter was placed in\nthe prime focus of the 6-meter telescope in order to minimize the influence of instrumental\neffects from other optical elements of the telescope.\nThe hydrogen line polarimeter was used to determine circular polarization of radiation\n(V /I) simultaneously in both wings of a hydrogen line. Actual observations were performed\nin two Balmer lines, H\u03b2 and H\u03b3 . The polarimeter cuts out two narrow bands from the line\nwings of the width 18 \u00c5 each, using a special mask. Both spectral transmission bands were\nlocated symmetrically about the line core, and the edges of transmission were shifted by 2\n\u00c5 away from the core.\nProfiles of both H\u03b2 and H\u03b3 lines are usually very similar but are not identical.\nFirst, we determined the average profiles of both lines separately with the same mask,\nwhich was described above. Then the averaged line profiles were used to determine the\ntransformation coefficient between the degree of circular polarization measured in line wings,\nand the stellar effective magnetic field Be . That transformation was measured in both H\u03b2\nand H\u03b3 line wings simultaneously, taking into account a real contribution of each line to the\ntotal flux (weighted by the number of photons received per second). At the time of actual\nobservations of \u03b3 Equ the transformation coefficient was equal to Kb = 37000 G per 1 % of\nthe circular polarization.\nMeasurements of the circular polarization were performed both in the blue and red\nline wings simultaneously, which allowed us to find and take into account instrumental\ncontribution to the observed polarization. Stability of the modulator and other optical\nand electronic components of our instrumentation were constantly monitored at the time of\nobservations. Moreover, at the time of the observing run we measured also other stars with\nthe well known values of the magnetic field Be , usually 2-3 times per run.\n\n2.2.\n\nObservations\n\nObservations of the magnetic field Be in \u03b3 Equ were performed during a single night of\n20/21 August 1989. Heliocentric moments of the beginning and the end of our observations\nare JD 2447759.414471 and .545842, respectively.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nTime length of a single exposure was determined by the time of accumulation of up\nto 800000 photons, and it varied between 3 and 24 seconds. The average time length of a\nsingle observation was equal to 6.6 sec in our run. Time span between the end of a previous\nexposure and the beginning of the following one did not exceed 0.05 sec, which means that\na series of measurements was practically continuous. The total time length of our observing\nrun of \u03b3 Equ was equal to 189 minutes, which enabled us to collect 1720 estimates of Be of\nthis star. Such a large number of Be points in a single, uninterrupted series allowed us to\ncompute reliable power spectra of the above data.\nPhoton statistics implies some rough estimates of the error \u03c3 of a single magnetic field\ndetermination. The error\n\u221a\n\u03c3 \u2248 Kb \u00d7 100%/ 2N = 2925 G ,\n(1)\nwhere N denotes the number of accumulated photons (Shtol' 1993).\nThe error of a single Be measurement can be estimated in an independent way. We\nassume that the projected magnetic field Be does not change at the time of observations,\nand the scatter of individual Bei points results from random observational errors. Then, the\nerror of a single measurement equals\n\u03c3=\n\n1\nn\u22121\n\n\"\nX\ni\n\n(hBe i \u2212 Bei )2\n\n#1/2\n\n= 2837 G ,\n\n(2)\n\nfor the actual series of n = 1720 measurements. One can see that both independent estimates\nof the error of an individual Be observation differ rather insignificantly.\nWe stress here that we have presented in this paper the first magnetic field measurements\nobtained with such a fine time resolution, without any significant readout time between\nmeasurements.\n\n2.3.\n\nSpectral analysis of a time series\n\nWe have performed spectral analysis of the above Be time series using two different\nnumerical techniques: the power spectrum and the amplitude spectrum analysis. First, the\nstandard Fast Fourier Transform subroutines were used to analyse the above series of 1720\nBe measurements of \u03b3 Equ. We have computed its power spectrum in the frequency range\n0.185 \u2212 16.67 mHz, which corresponds to periods ranging from 90 min. to 1 min. Fig. 1\nshows the power spectrum, which is rather noisy in this frequency range. We have identified\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nthe distinct peak at 4.635 mHz, significantly exceeding the level of a spectral noise. The\npeak frequency corresponds to the period PB = 3.596 min.\nNumbers on the vertical axis of Fig. 1 denote the values of the normalised power of our\nBe series. Spectral power of a time series is the square of the Fourier transform. In case of\nmagnetic Be observations power can be measured in G2 /mHz2 . Normalised power of a signal\nis defined as the ratio of the true power and its variance, and therefore it is a dimensionless\nvariable (Horne & Baliunas 1986).\nThe advantage of using the normalised power is that Scargle (1982) proposed a relation\nbetween the power at a spectral peak and the probability that the peak corresponds either\nto real or false period in a time series (False Alarm Probability test).\nThe value of a normalised power at the peak of 4.635 mHz in our Be measurements\nequals 6.327. False Alarm Probability test of the latter paper predicts, that the peak is\nreal with the probability 67 % (cf. Section II.b in Horne & Baliunas 1986). Therefore,\nthe spectral peak is a 1 sigma event and the corresponding period is not necessarily a real\nfeature.\nSubsequently, we have analysed the amplitude spectrum of our Be time series with\nthe method developed by Kurtz (1985) and with his software (Kurtz 2004). Fig. 2 shows\nthe amplitude spectrum which is also flat with a much lower amplitude peak at the same\nfrequency. Fig. 2 allows one to estimate the noise level of our data, which is of the order of\n250 G. The amplitude of possible periodic Be variations shown there is of the order of 350\nG.\nFig. 3 presents the magnetic phase curve for \u03b3 Equ corresponding to the period PB =\n3.596 min. Phase curve was fitted to ten hBe i points, which were obtained by averaging\nof individual noisy Be measurements in phase bins of the width 0.1 PB . The value of hBe i\naveraged over all phases equals \u2212750\u00b122 G, and the amplitude of the phase curve is 347\u00b131\nG.\nOne should note that the phase plot in Fig. 3 does not confirm the reality of the peak\nin Fourier transform. Any high peak in the FT will produce a phase plot where you can see\napparent variation. That is true whether the peak is real or spurious (Kurtz 2004). The only\nuseful information given by Fig. 3 is that the phase coverage of the Be data in our series is\nsatisfactory, assuming that the PB = 3.596 min period, or rather 4.635 mHz peak frequency,\nis real.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n\nFig. 1.- Power spectrum of the series of 1720 Be observations.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n\nFig. 2.- The amplitude spectrum for our series of 1720 Be measurements.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n\nGam.Equ P = 3.596 min\n-200\n-400\n\nBe (G)\n\n-600\n-800\n-1000\n-1200\n-1400\n-1600\n-0,4\n\n-0,2\n\n0,0\n\n0,2\n\n0,4\n\n0,6\n\n0,8\n\n1,0\n\n1,2\n\n1,4\n\nPhase\n\nFig. 3.- Magnetic sine phase curve best fitted to our hBe i points computed for the period\nPB = 3.596 min.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n3.\n\nDiscusion\n\nMost of the previously analysed magnetic measurements of \u03b3 Equ were obtained in\nmetal lines. Consequently, the results could be affected by a nonuniform distribution of\nthese elements over the stellar surface. Such a well known effect is common among Ap stars.\nMoreover, Be measurements in metal lines in principle may be distorted by other effects, e.g.\nby complex blending of lines, cross-over effect, etc.\nThe only exception is the paper by Hubrig et al. (2004) who obtained their Be measurements in wings of the hydrogen Balmer lines. As a consequence, their Be data are free of the\nabove effects, and they seem to be more credible since the hydrogen line Be data represent\nbest the value of the longitudinal component of the global magnetic field integrated over the\nstellar disc.\nIt is a well known fact, that the profiles and equivalent widths of the Balmer lines exhibit\nperiodic variations in most of Ap stars. Such variations are the result of stellar rotation, and\nproceed with the corresponding rotational period. For example, observations of the periodic\nvariability of H\u03b2 line with Prot were presented by Madej (1983) and Musielok & Madej (1988)\nfor a group of bright Ap stars. The presence of rapid variations in the wings of Balmer lines\nin \u03b3 Equ cannot be excluded, since momentary line profiles should reflect all changes in the\nstructure of a stellar atmosphere caused by pulsations. However, the impact of a possible\nrapid variability of Balmer line profiles on the Be determinations is unknown and will be the\nsubject of our research in future.\nOne can also note, that the amplitudes of magnetic curves observed in hydrogen lines\ncan be distinctly larger than the amplitudes measured in metal lines. Such an effect arises\nsince (in atmospheres of magnetic Ap stars) far wings of hydrogen lines are formed mostly in\nmuch deeper layers than metal lines. Therefore, if strength or direction of the local surface\nmagnetic field depends on depth, i.e. if it exhibits nonzero gradient, then the apparent\nintensity of Be and its temporal variations can differ depending on the depth of a spectral\nline formation.\nHubrig et al. (2004) presented only 18 individual measurements of the longitudinal\nmagnetic field Be of \u03b3 Equ, due to the cloudy weather during their 2.5 hour observing run.\nThey did not find any significant traces of the period. In particular, Hubrig et al. (2004)\ndid not confirm any periodic variability close to the four pulsation periods in the range\n11.68\u201312.44 min. (Martinez et al. 1996).\nWe have taken 18 magnetic field Be points from Hubrig et al. (2004), and searched for\na period P disregarding small number of available points. They show pure spectral noise\nwith amplitude of \u2248 150 G in the frequency range 0 \u2212 6 mHz, hence they do not confirm\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nour marginal period of PB .\nWe cannot rule out the possibility, that processes which cause rapid pulsations in \u03b3 Equ\nare not stable, and cause a drift of pulsation periods and amplitudes with time. One can\nspeculate, that our observations and the period of Be obtained in 1989 (PB = 3.596 min.)\ndo not correspond to Be periods obtained at a later time.\nSuch a hypothesis would explain, why Leone & Kurtz (2003), and Savanov et al. (2003)\ncould obtain a period close to the photometric period Pphot = 12.44 min. On the other hand,\nKochukhov et al. (2004a,b) might have observed \u03b3 Equ during a time interval, when the\namplitude of rapid variations of Be decreased below the detection limit.\nKochukhov et al. (2004a,b) measured magnetic field Be in lines of Fe I, Fe II, and Nd III,\nwhich may not be very sensitive to the magnetic field variations (Nd III lines were useful to\nmeasure variations of radial velocity). Plachinda & Polosukhina (1994) showed, that values\nof Be determined in different lines can differ by a factor up to a few times. Therefore, we\npropose that the most representative values of Be are those measured in wings of hydrogen\nBalmer lines.\n\n4.\n\nSummary\n\nIn this paper we present our high time resolution observations of the global longitudinal\nmagnetic field in the Ap star \u03b3 Equ = HD 201601. The series of 1720 measurements was\nobtained during 189 min. of a single uninterrupted run on August 20-21, 1989. We found\nthat the average value of hBe i at the time of observations equals \u2212750 \u00b1 22 G.\nSpectral analysis of this time series has shown that the frequency spectrum of \u03b3 Equ\nis flat. However, we have found possible variations of the global-scale Be with the period\nPB = 3.596 min. There is only a 67 % probability that this period is a real feature (1 sigma\nevent), and therefore, its significance is not high.\nBoth the power spectrum and the amplitude spectrum of our data reveal no signal\nat the frequency of pulsations, which was identified with the well-known period of rapid\nphotometric variations, Pphot = 12.44 min. Our amplitude spectrum (Fig. 2) shows, that if\nrapid variations of Be with the period 12.44 min. existed in 1989, then their amplitude was\nlower than \u2248 250 G (noise level).\nThere exists a number of theoretical papers, which attempt to explain the existence of\nnonradial pulsations in Ap stars with very short periods of the order \u223c 10 min (Bigot et al.\n2000; Cunha & Gough 2000; Bigot & Dziembowski 2002). We believe, that the model of\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\ninclined pulsator presented in the latter paper is the most relevant one to discuss possible\nvariations of the global magnetic field in \u03b3 Equ with periods as short as 3.6 min.\nOur thanks are due to Don Kurtz for providing his Fortran software used here to compute\nthe amplitude spectrum of \u03b3 Equ and for critical comments regarding our results.
