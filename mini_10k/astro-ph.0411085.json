Introduction\nWith the detection of dust and molecular gas in sources at\nhigh redshift, it has become possible to probe the physical\nconditions of the interstellar medium in galaxies and in\nthe hosts of quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) at cosmological\ndistances. The high-z sources detected in 12 CO (to date\n30 sources between 1.44 < z < 6.42 - see, e.g., Greve et al.\n2004) have massive reservoirs of warm and dense molecular gas (a few 1010 \u2212 1011 M\u2299 ), which are predominantly\nexcited by extreme starbursts with implied star formation\nrates \u2248 103 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . Multiline CO studies are available\nin only a few cases, and the detection of species other than\ncarbon monoxide is reported in only a couple of sources.\nA remarkable example is the Cloverleaf, a strong gravitationally lensed QSO at z = 2.56 where four CO transitions\nwere detected, together with the two fine-structure lines\nof neutral carbon [Ci] (Barvainis et al. 1997; Weiss et al.\n2003) and the J=1\u21920 transition of HCN (Solomon et al.\n2003).\nAtomic carbon is an important probe of the neutral\ndense gas. It is a good tracer of molecular gas in external\ngalaxies and plays a central role in the cooling of the gas\n(G\u00e9rin & Phillips 1998, 2000). In high-z sources, the detecSend offprint requests to: J. Pety, pety@iram.fr\n\u22c6\nBased on observations obtained with the IRAM Plateau de\nBure interferometer.\n\ntion of the [Ci] lines enables to obtain further constraints\non the physical conditions of the interstellar gas in addition to those obtained from the CO transitions (Weiss et\nal. 2003), providing useful information on the gas column\ndensity, the thermal balance, and the UV illumination.\nPSS 2322+1944 is an optically luminous, gravitationally lensed QSO at z = 4.12 which was studied in detail\nboth in the dust and radio continuum emission (Omont\net al. 2001; Beelen et al. 2004) and in the J=5\u21924, 4\u21923,\n2\u21921, and 1\u21920 transitions lines of CO (Cox et al. 2002;\nCarilli et al. 2002). With an apparent far-infrared (FIR)\nluminosity of 3 \u00d7 1013 L\u2299 , it harbors a massive reservoir\nof molecular gas which is the site of active star formation\nwith an implied star formation rate of \u223c 900 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . The\nCO line emission is resolved into an Einstein Ring with a\ndiameter of 1.\u2032\u2032 5, a direct indication of lensing. The amplification factor is estimated to be about 3.5. The data are\nconsistent with a disk surrounding the QSO with a radius\nof 2 kpc and a dynamical mass of a few 1010 M\u2299 (Carilli\net al. 2003).\nThe observations of the molecular gas in\nPSS 2322+1944 provide one of the best examples to\ndate of active star formation in the host galaxy of a\nluminous, high redshift QSO. The strong CO emission in\nPSS 2322+1944 makes it a prime target to search for the\n3\nP1 \u21923 P0 transition of [Ci] (\u03bdrest = 492.161 GHz) which,\nat z = 4.12, is shifted into the 3 mm atmospheric window.\n\n\f2\n\nJ.

Observed spectra of the [Ci]3 P1 \u21923 P0 (this paper)\nand CO(J =4\u21923) lines (from Cox et al. 2002) toward the\nz = 4.12 quasar PSS 2322+1944. The black horizontal\nlines show the zero flux density level. The red lines show\nthe results of Gaussian + continuum fits.\nHere we report the 3 P1 \u21923 P0 [Ci] line in\nPSS 2322+1944. After the detection of [Ci] in the\nCloverleaf, and, recently, in IRAS FSC 10214 (z = 2.3)\nand SMM J14011+0252 (z = 2.5) reported by Weiss et\nal. (2004), these observations represent the fourth\nclear detection of [Ci] in a high-z source. In this paper, we assume the concordance \u039b-cosmology with\nH0 = 71 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9\u039b = 0.73 and \u03a9m = 0.27\n(Spergel et al. 2003).\n\n2. Observations and data reduction\nObservations of the 3 P1 \u21923 P0 transition of [Ci] in\nPSS 2322+1944 were carried out with the IRAM Plateau\nde Bure interferometer (PdBI) in a series of observing ses-\n\nsions between July 2002 and June 2004. The total integration time of the useful data is equivalent to 34 hours\nwith 6 antennas. In practice, all the observing time was\nallocated during the summer, when antenna maintenance\ntakes place. The total on-sky integration time amounts\nto 116 hours often with 4 or 5 (and sometimes with 6)\nantennas.\nWe used the interferometer in the D configuration. The\ncombined 3.2 mm data result in a synthesized beam of\n6.\u2032\u2032 85 \u00d7 5.\u2032\u2032 09 at a position angle of 73\u25e6 . The 3 mm receivers\nwere tuned first at the red-shifted frequency of the [Ci]\n3\nP1 \u21923 P0 line, i.e. 96.127 GHz at z = 4.119 and then at\n96.063 GHz for the second half of the data. This is the\nreason why the spectrum is noisier at the very ends of\nthe band (Fig. 1). At those frequencies, the typical SSB\nsystem temperatures were \u2248 150\u2212250 K. The water vapor\nranged between 4 and 10 mm on different sessions. The\n580 MHz instantaneous IF\u2013bandwidth were observed with\na resolution of 1.5 MHz.\nAll data reduction were done using the gildas softwares. Standard calibration methods using close calibrators were applied. The bandpass calibration was done on\nthe quasar 3C454.3. The amplitude and phase calibration were performed on 3C454.3 and the nearby quasar\n2230+114. Only data with phase noise better than 40 deg\nwere used. The maximum position errors at 3.2 mm introduced by such phase noise is < 0.\u2032\u2032 5. The flux calibration\n\n\fJ. Pety et al.: [Ci] in a quasar at redshift 4.12\n\n3\n\nTable 1.

The\nfluxes of 3C454.3 (resp. 2230+114) varied from 7 to 4 Jy\n(resp. 4 to 2.4 Jy) during the 3 years observing period.\nA standard calibrated uv table was produced and analyzed both by direct fits in the uv plane (as this avoids\nthe deconvolution step) and by making the deconvolved\nimage shown in Fig. 2. Both methods confirm that the\n[Ci] 3 P1 \u21923 P0 emission is i) detected, ii) not resolved by\nour observations and iii) centered on the optical position\nwhich is also the phase center of the observations. The two\nlatter points allow us to derive the source spectrum from\nthe real part of the average of all the complex visibilities.\nThe main advantage of this method is to directly obtain\nthe spectrum from simple operations instead of applying\nthe usual fitting procedures in the uv plane. Any further\nprocessing (smoothing, fitting) was performed using the\nclass software.\nThe final [Ci] spectrum at a velocity resolution of\n90 km s\u22121 is displayed in Fig. 1 together with the spectrum of the J =4\u21923 transition of CO. The image of\nthe [Ci] emission is shown in Fig. 2. The [Ci] 3 P1 \u21923 P0\nfine-structure line is clearly detected at the same redshift as the CO emission with a peak flux density of\nS\u03bd = 2.69 \u00b1 0.31 mJy (including the continuum flux of\n0.31 mJy). Table 1 summarizes the line parameters derived from continuum + Gaussian fits.\n\n3. Results and Discussion\nThe integrated flux of the [Ci] 3 P1 \u21923 P0 line is 0.81 \u00b1\n0.12 Jy km s\u22121 , a factor of 5 lower than the CO(4\u21923) line.\nA Gaussian fit yields a line width of 319 \u00b1 66 km s\u22121 and a\nline center displaced by \u221250 km s\u22121 relative to CO(4\u21923).\nDue to the weak signal to noise ratio of the [Ci] data,\nthe difference in the line position with the higher quality\nCO(4\u21923) data should not be over-interpreted. The [Ci]\nline flux implies a line luminosity of L\u2032CI = 3.4 \u00b1 0.5 \u00d7\n1010 K km s\u22121 pc2 or 1.1 \u00b1 0.2 \u00d7 108 L\u2299 (see, e.g., Solomon\net al. 1997 for the definition of the line luminosity). The\n[Ci] luminosity in PSS 2322+1944 is thus about a factor\n2 lower than in the case of the Cloverleaf where L\u2032CI =\n6.1 \u00d7 1010 K km s\u22121 pc2 , as derived from the [Ci] velocityintegrated flux of Barvainis et al. (1997).\nThe continuum emission is detected at 96 GHz with\n0.31 \u00b1 0.08 mJy, which is consistent for dust emission with\nthe available photometric data at higher frequency. The\nFIR spectral energy distribution of PSS 2322+1944 is well\n\nreproduced with a grey body of temperature 43 \u00b1 6 K and\na dust emissivity \u221d \u03bd 1.6\u00b10.3 (Beelen et al. 2004).\nThe detection of the [Ci] 3 P1 \u21923 P0 emission line\nin PSS 2322+1944 allows us to estimate the mass of\nneutral carbon MCI . Since the 3 P2 \u21923 P1 transition (at\n\u03bdrest = 809.342 GHz) is not observed, we assume that the\n3\nP1 \u21923 P0 transition is optically thin as is the case for the\nCloverleaf (Weiss et al. 2003). Under these assumptions,\nwe can express the mass of neutral carbon as a function\nof L\u2032CI\nMCI = 5.65 \u00d7 10\u22124\n\nQ (23.6/Tex ) \u2032\ne\nLCI(3 P1 \u21923 P0 ) M\u2299 , (1)\n3\n\nwhere Tex is the excitation temperature and Q is the Ci\npartition function. Assuming that Tex is equal to the temperature of the warm dust Tdust = 43 K, the mass of\nneutral carbon in PSS 2322+1944 amounts to MCI =\n4.3 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 , or 1.2 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 after correction for lens\namplification (m = 3.5). Although the excitation temperature of the neutral carbon can be different than Tdust (as\nobserved for the Cloverleaf - see Weiss et al. 2003), the\nderived mass depends only weakly on Tex . For a range of\n[Ci] excitation temperatures from 30 to 100 K, the mass\nof neutral carbon in PSS 2322+1944 would vary from 1.2\nto 1.4 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 .\nCompared to the mass of molecular gas of MH2 =\n7 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 after correcting for amplification (Cox et al.\n2002; Carilli et al. 2003), the derived mass of [Ci] implies\na carbon abundance relative to H2 of [Ci]/[H2 ]\u2248 3 \u00d7 10\u22125,\nindicating near to solar abundances in this high-redshift\nsystem. Similar values are derived by Weiss et al. (2004).\nThis relative carbon abundance is close to the maximum\nvalue of 2.2 \u00d7 10\u22125 found for Galactic dense molecular\nclouds with opacities of 4 \u2212 11 mag, a value which does\nnot vary within a factor of a few for larger AV 's (Frerking\net al. 1989).\nThe [Ci] 3 P1 \u21923 P0 and 3 P2 \u21923 P1 lines are major gas\ncoolants. In the Cloverleaf, the 3 P2 \u21923 P1 line is 2.2 times\nstronger than the 3 P1 \u21923 P0 line (Weiss et al. 2003).\nTo estimate the carbon cooling, we may assume a similar ratio for PSS 2322+1944. To compare this to the CO\ncooling, we added the observed CO line luminosities of\nPSS 2322+1944 up to J = 9 \u2212 8, where for the unobserved\ntransitions we adopt the prediction of the LVG model of\nCarilli et al. (2002). In PSS 2322+1944, we find that the\nCO/[Ci] luminosity ratio is 6, as compared to a ratio of 20\nfor the Cloverleaf (see Table 2). However, the total mass\n\n\f4\n\nJ.

The recent search of the redshifted [Cii] fine-structure line in PSS 2322+1944 implies\nan upper limit to the [Cii] line luminosity of 1.7\u00d7109 L\u2299 , a\nweakness which is typical for high-z IR luminous galaxies\n(Benford et al. 2004). The CO and C cooling is therefore\nmore than half of the cooling due to C+ . The [Cii] line\nremains the main cooling line of the gas.\nFinally, the [Ci] luminosity relative to the integrated\nfar-IR luminosity is a good measure of the intensity of\nthe non-ionizing UV radiation field in galaxies, because in\nphotodissociation regions the column density of neutral\ncarbon is mostly insensitive to the UV field, whereas the\nfar-IR emission is directly proportional to the strength\nof the UV field (see, e.g., Kaufman et al. 1999; G\u00e9rin &\nPhillips 2000). For PSS 2322+1944, this ratio is \u223c 3\u00d710\u22126\nindicating a UV radiation field of a few 1000 times larger\nthan in the solar vicinity. Both this ratio and the implied\nstrength of the UV illumination are comparable to the\nvalues derived for the other IR luminous galaxies and the\ngalactic center listed in Table 2.\nAs in the case for local starburst galaxies such as\nNGC253, CO is a more important coolant than C in both\nPSS 2322+1944 and the Cloverleaf by about one order of\nmagnitude (Table 2) - see also Schilke et al. (1993) and\nBayet et al. (2004). Similarly, in starburst galaxies or in\ngalactic nuclei (including the Milky Way), the molecular gas is warm therefore populating the higher CO levels\nwhich contribute to the cooling.\nThe detection of the red-shifted [Ci] 3 P1 \u21923 P0 transition line in the gravitationally lensed z = 4.12 QSO\nPSS 2322+1944 enables to further constrain the physical conditions of the neutral gas and to compare the major line (C, CO and C+ ) and far-IR luminosities in this\nhigh-z galaxy. Together with the recent [Ci] detections in\nother sources at high redshift (Weiss et al. 2004), these\nresults illustrate the potential of studying neutral carbon\n\nor species other than CO in high-z sources, a field which\nwill clearly fully develop as soon as more sensitive submillimeter arrays, such as the Atacama Large Millimeter\nArray (ALMA), will become operational.\nAcknowledgements.
