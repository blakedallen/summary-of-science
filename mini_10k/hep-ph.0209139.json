The charmed quark-antiquark pairs are assumed\nto be created at the initial stage of the reaction in hard parton collisions. The number\nof these pairs is conserved during the evolution of the system. At the hadronization\nstage, the charmed (anti)quarks are distributed among open and hidden charm hadrons\nin accordance with the laws of statistical mechanics.\nThe model is in agreement with the experimental data on J/psi to Drell-Yan ratio in\nPb+Pb collisions at SPS. This agreement can be reached only if a rather strong enhancement of the open charm production in central Pb+Pb collisions is assumed. A possible\nmechanism of the charm enhancement is discussed.\nAt the top RHIC energy, the model predicts an increase of J/psi to Drell-Yan ratio in\nmore central nucleus-nucleus collisions with respect to less central ones.\n\nThe interest to charmed quarks in heavy ion physics was initially motivated by the\nsuggestion of Matsui and Satz [1] to use charmonia as a probe of the state of matter\ncreated at the early stage of the collision.\nThe standard picture of charmonium production in nucleus-nucleus collisions assumes\nthat charmonia are created exclusively at the initial stage of the reaction in primary\nnucleon-nucleon collisions. During the subsequent evolution of the system, the number of\nhidden charm mesons is reduced because of (a) absorption of pre-resonance charmonium\nstates in the nuclei (normal nuclear suppression), (b) interactions of charmonia with secondary hadrons (comovers), (c) dissociation of cc\u0304 bound states in the deconfined medium.\nIt was found that the J/\u03c8 suppression with respect to Drell-Yan muon pairs measured\nin proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions with light projectiles can be explained\nby the normal nuclear suppression alone [2]. In contrast, the NA50 experiment with a\nheavy projectile and target (lead-lead) revealed essentially stronger J/\u03c8 suppression for\ncentral collisions [3]. This anomalous J/\u03c8 suppression was attributed to formation of\nquark-gluon plasma [4].\nDespite of quite successful agreement with the J/\u03c8 data, the standard scenario seems\nto be in trouble explaining the \u03c8 \u2032 yield. The recent lattice simulations [5] suggest that the\ntemperature of \u03c8 \u2032 dissociation Td (\u03c8 \u2032 ) lies far below the deconfinement point Tc : Td (\u03c8 \u2032 ) \u2248\n\n\f2\n0.1\u20130.2Tc [6]. Therefore, not only the quark-gluon plasma, but also a hadronic co-mover\nmedium should completely eliminate \u03c8 \u2032 charmonia in central Pb+Pb collisions at SPS.\nHowever, the experiment revealed a sizable \u03c8 \u2032 yield (see, for instance, [7]). It was observed\n[8] that \u03c8 \u2032 to J/\u03c8 ratio decreases with centrality only in peripheral lead-lead collisions,\nbut remains approximately constant at sufficiently large number of participants Np \u2265 100.\nA completely different picture of charmonium production was proposed in Ref. [9]:\nhidden charm mesons are supposed to be created at the hadronization stage. Similar\nto all other hadrons, their abundancies can be described within the thermal model [10].\nHowever, production of heavy quarks in soft processes is expected to be negligible. Most\nlikely, they are produced exclusively at the hard stage. Their number, therefore, can,\ngenerally speaking, deviate from the thermal equilibrium value. This fact was taken into\naccount by the statistical coalescence model (SCM), which was proposed in Ref.[11]. Soon,\nit was realised that, when the average number of heavy quark pairs per collision is small\n(. 1), exact conservation of this pairs in the hadronization process appears to be crucial\n[12].\nIn this talk, I present the results [13,14] obtained within the statistical coalescence\nmodel:\n\u2022 c and c\u0304 are created at the initial stage of the reaction in primary hard parton\ncollisions;\n\u2022 their number remains approximately unchanged during the subsequent evolution;\n\u2022 they are distributed over open charm hadrons and charmonia at the hadronization\nstage in accordance with laws of statistical mechanics.\nWithin its applicability domain (Np & 100), the model demonstrates excellent agreement (\u03c72 /dof = 1.06) with the NA50 data on J/\u03c8 production (see Fig. 1).\nThe so-called 'second threshold of anomalous J/\u03c8 suppression' at large transverse energy (ET & 100 GeV) naturally appears in SCM due to two effects: (i) fluctuations of\nthe transverse energy at fixed number of participant nucleons and (ii) ET -losses in the\ndimuon event sample with respect to the minimum bias one (see Ref. [14] for details).\nThe agreement with the data is reached assuming a rather strong enhancement of the\nopen charm production in central Pb+Pb collisions: up to a factor of about 3.5 within\nthe rapidity window of the NA50 spectrometer. This is consistent with the indirect\nexperimental result [15].\nA possible mechanism of open charm enhancement was proposed in Ref. [16]. Calculations in the leading order of perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) show that,\nassuming factorization (i.e. independence of the hard QCD process on the subsequent\nsoft stage), a great fraction of cc pairs is created with invariant masses Mcc below the corresponding meson threshold 2mD . In vacuum, these subthreshold pairs would not be able\nto form observable hadrons. In reality, however, some part of these pairs may hadronize\ndue to interaction with spectator partons. Nevertheless, there is no reason to assert that\nall subthreshold pairs result in final state hadrons with open or hidden charm. It is quite\nreasonable to assume that a great part of them has to annihilate into lighter hadrons, or,\nalternatively, the final state interactions prevent formation of such pairs (factorization is\nbroken).\n\n\f3\n\nPb-Pb 1996\nPb-Pb 1996 min. bias\nPb-Pb 1998 min. bias\nSCM\n\nBJ/\u03c8\n\u03bc\u03bc \u03c3(J/\u03c8)/\u03c3(DY)\n\n50\n40\n30\n20\n\n18\n16\n14\n104 \u03c3(J/\u03c8\u3009)/\u03c3(c\uf8e7\nc)\n\n60\n\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n\n10\n\n200 GeV\n130 GeV\n56 GeV\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60 80 100 120\nET (GeV)\n\nFigure 1.

The dependence of the J/\u03c8 to\nopen charm ratio on the number of nucleon participants at RHIC. The vertical\nline shows the boundary of the applicability domain of the statistical coalescence\nmodel (SCM).\n\nIn presence of a deconfined medium (quark-gluon plasma or its precursor), the subthreshold quark pairs can hadronize due to interactions with the medium, or, alternatively, the medium can modify the final state interactions making possible creation of\nthe subthreshold pairs and their subsequent hadronization. This should lead to enhanced\nproduction of the total charm in nucleus-nucleus collisions in comparison to the standard\nresult obtained within the direct extrapolation of nucleon-nucleon data.\nWe have estimated the upper bound of the open charm enhancement. At SPS energies,\none can expect maximal enhancement by a factor of about 6, which is consistent with our\nabove fit for the J/\u03c8 to Drell-Yan ratio.\nIt is interesting to note, that the statistical coalescence model does not always lead to\nJ/\u03c8 suppression. Predictions of the statistical coalescence model for RHIC are shown in\nFig. 1 (see also Ref.[17]). As is seen, J/\u03c8 suppression is still expected at the lowest RHIC\nenergy. In contrast, relative J/\u03c8 enhancement (e.g. growth of the J/\u03c8 to open charm1\nratio with the number of participants at Np > 100) is predicted for the top RHIC energy.\nIn conclusion, the NA50 data for not very peripheral lead-lead collisions are consistent\nwith the following scenario:\n1\n\nIt should be stressed that, due to possible nuclear shadowing, the open charm multiplicity has not to be\nproportional to the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions. Therefore the ratio of J/\u03c8 multiplicity\nto the number of binary collisions may decrease even if J/\u03c8 to open charm ratio increases.\n\n\f4\nFormation of deconfined medium leads to enhanced production of charmed hadrons.\nCharmonia as well as other hadrons are formed at the hadronization stage. The distribution of charm quarks and antiquarks over open and hidden charm hadrons follows laws of\nstatistical mechanics.\nA relative J/\u03c8 enhancement is expected at the top RHIC energy.\nI am indebted to M.
