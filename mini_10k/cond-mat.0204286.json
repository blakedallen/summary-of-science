The chosen molecules have complex donor and acceptor configurations,\nand relatively simple structure of the bridge, which enables us to concentrate our studies on\ndonor/acceptor coupling to the bridge. We present analytical and numerical results concerning\nthe effect of donor/acceptor coupling to the bridge on the ET process in molecules with complex\ndonor/acceptor subsystems.\nPACS numbers: 05.60.Gg, 36.20.-r\n\nLong-distance electron transfer (ET) plays a central\nrole in many biological processes [1]. It has been established that molecular ET is essentially a combination\nof nuclear environment fluctuations and electron tunneling [2]. The expression for the ET rate including both\nelectronic and nuclear factors was first proposed by Marcus [3, 4, 5]. The existing theories of long-range ET are\nmainly concentrated on the analysis of the electron tunneling through the bridge (Refs [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]).\nHitherto, less attention has been paid to systematic studies of donor/acceptor coupling to the bridge and its contribution to the electronic transmission coefficient. Usually, theoretical models of ET present both donor and\nacceptor as single sites with one state per site. In realistic biological systems, however, donor and acceptor subsystems are complex and include numerous sites which\nprovide effective coupling to the bridge.\nIn this letter, we study the effect of the donor/acceptor\nsubsystems on the characteristics of the long-range ET\nin macromolecules. We use an apparent close similarity between this process and an electron transport\nthrough molecular wire placed between metallic contacts. This enables us to apply the methods developed\nin Refs. [13, 14, 15, 16] to calculate the electron transmission function T (E) which we can further analyze to\nseparate out contributions from different donor/acceptor\nsites participating in the ET process. We also calculate\ncurrent-voltage characteristics of the intramolecular electron transport.\nIn further studies, we simulate our donor and acceptor subsystems as sets of semi-infinite tight-binding homogeneous chains. Each chain is attached to a site of\ndonor/acceptor which can be effectively coupled to the\nbridge. To simplify the following calculations we assume\nthat the chains do not interact with each other. This\nmodel for the donor/acceptor subsystem is a generalization of that adopted in the theory of electron transport through molecular wires [13, 14, 15, 16] where each\nmetallic electrode was treated as a single chain. However, in the present analysis we need this generalization\nto take into account the complexity of the donor/acceptor\n\nsubsystems.\nTo proceed we consider each element of the donorbridge-acceptor system as an array of potential wells.\nEach well represents one atomic orbital of the corresponding part of the molecule (donor, acceptor or\nbridge). These wells are sites of the donor-bridgeacceptor system. Within this approach, any atom will be\nrepresented by a set of sites corresponding to its states,\nand we do not distinguish between sites corresponding\nto the same atom, and those corresponding to different\natoms of our molecular system [8, 17].\nIn the following calculations we start from a tightbinding Hamiltonian for the bridge:\nH = H 0 + H1\n\n(1)\n\nwhose matrix elements between states |i > and |j > corresponding to the i-th and j-th sites are given by:\n(H0 )ij = \u03b1i \u03b4ij ;\n\n(H1 )ij = Vij ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b4ij is Kronecker symbol, Vij = 0 when i = j and\nonly states associated with valence electrons are considered. The diagonal matrix elements \u03b1i are ionization energies of electrons at sites i, while the off-diagonal matrix\nelements Vij = Vji are the hopping strengths between the\nith and jth sites. Both direct and exchange energy contribution are included in Vij . As well as it was carried\nout in [15, 16] we also take into account self-energy corrections arising due to the coupling of the donor (\u03a3D )\nand acceptor (\u03a3A ) to the bridge. As a result, we arrive\nat the effective Hamiltonian for the bridge, i.e.,\nHef f = H + HD + HA .\n\n(3)\n\nGeneralizing the results of Ref. [18] for the case when\nwe have several donor and acceptor sites coupling to the\nbridge, we obtain\n\u0010 \u0011\n2\nX\nDki\n\u03b4ij ,\n(4)\n(HD )ij = \u03a3D \u03b4ij \u2261\nE \u2212 \u01ebk \u2212 \u03c3k\ni\nk\n\n(HA )ij = (\u03a3A )i \u03b4ij \u2261\n\nX\nl\n\nAil2\n\u03b4ij .\nE \u2212 \u01ebl \u2212 \u03c3l\n\n(5)\n\n\f2\nHere, Dki and Ail are, respectively, coupling strengths\nbetween the k-th donor site or the l-th acceptor\nsite\nthe i-th siteo of the bridge, and \u03c3k,l =\nn and q\n1\n2\n\n2 \u2212 \u03b82\n\u03b8k,l \u2212 i 4\u03b3k,l\nare the self-energy corrections\nk,l\nof the semiinfinite chains attached to the corresponding\nsites [13]. The parameters \u03b8k,l = E \u2212\u01ebk,l , \u01ebk,l and \u03b3k,l are\nthe ionization energies of electrons at the corresponding\ndonor/acceptor sites, and the nearest-neighbor hopping\nintegrals for the chains. Summation in Eqs. (4) and (5)\nis carried out over all donor/acceptor sites coupled to the\nbridge. Due to the presence of the self-energy corrections\n\u03a3D,A , the eigenvalues of the effective Hamiltonian (3) include imaginary parts \u0393i which represent broadening of\nthe bridge energy levels Ei originating from the coupling\nof the bridge to the donor and acceptor systems. The\nenergy levels are broadened further if include scattering\nprocesses in the bridge. Here, however, for simplicity, we\nseparate the effect of electronic dephasing, assuming that\ncoherent electronic tunneling through a bridge to be the\npredominant mechanism of ET.\nTreating the long-range ET processes, we can neglect\nthe direct coupling of donor sites to acceptor sites. Then\nthe probability amplitude for the transition between the\nk-th donor site and the l-th acceptor site is given by [19]\nX\nDki Gij Ajl .\n(6)\nTkl =\ni,j\n\nHere, the sum is carried out over the bridge sites, Gij is\nthe matrix element of the Green's function corresponding\nto Hef f , i.e.,\nD\nE\n\u22121\nGij = i (E \u2212 Hef f )\nj .\n(7)\nAn electric tunneling current I flowing from donor to\nacceptor through the bridge in the presence of a small\napplied voltage V has the form [20]\n2\u03c0e X\n2\nI=\nf (Ek ) [1 \u2212 f (El + eV )] | Tkl\n| \u03b4 (Ek \u2212 El )\nh\u0304\nk,l\n\n(8)\nwhere f (E) is the Fermi function; e is the charge of\nthe electron. Assuming that the applied potential varies\nlinearly in the molecule, we can use the approximation\nV = V0 (Lb /Lmol ), where Lb and Lmol are the lengths\nof the bridge and the whole molecule, respectively, and\nV0 is a voltage applied across the whole molecule. Starting from the expression (8) and following a usual way we\narrive at the standard formula [21]:\nZ \u221e\ne\nI=\ndE T (E)[f (E \u2212 \u03bc1 ) \u2212 f (E \u2212 \u03bc2 )] , (9)\n\u03c0h\u0304 \u2212\u221e\nwhere the chemical potentials \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 are determined\nby the equilibrium Fermi energy of the bridge EF and\nthe effective voltage V across the bridge [16], i.e.,\n\u03bc1 = EF + (1 \u2212 \u03b7) eV ;\n\n\u03bc2 = EF \u2212 \u03b7eV.\n\nFIG. 1: The calculated current (nA) \u2013 voltage (V) characteristics for different temperatures.\n\nHere the parameter \u03b7 characterizes how the voltage V is\ndivided between the two ends of the bridge. The equilibrium Fermi energy for the bridge can be determined\nfrom the equation (See Ref. [16]):\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2X \u03c0\nEf \u2212 Ei\nN=\n,\n(10)\n+ arctan\n\u03c0 i\n2\n\u0393i\nwhere N is the number of electrons on the bridge part of\nthe molecule.\nThe electron transmission function included in the expression (9) is given by the formula\nX\n\u2206i |Gij |2 \u2206j ,\n(11)\nT (E) = 2\ni,j\n\nwhere the summation is carried out over the states of the\nbridge, and the quantities \u2206i,j are defined as\n\u2206i = Im (\u03a3D )ii ,\n\n\u2206j = Im (\u03a3A )ii .\n\nThis formula agrees with the result obtained earlier in\nthe study of electron transport through molecular wires\n[15].\nWe see that contributions to the transmission function T (E) from different donor and acceptor sites are\ndetermined by the factors \u2206i,j . It follows from Eqs. (4)\nand (5) that these factors strongly depend on energydependent denominators. When the tunneling energy E\ntakes on a value close to \u01ebk,l , the corresponding term\nin Eqs. (4) and (5) can surpass all remaining terms.\nThus, for different values of E, different donor and acceptor sites can predominate in the ET process. Expressions (4) and (5) enable us to determine these dominating sites for any interval of tunneling energy E. In\nFig.1 we present results for the calculated I\u2013V characteristics for the porphyrine-nitrobenzene macromolecules\nfor different temperatures (T = 1K, 50K, 100K, 300K).\n\n\f3\nthe integrand of (9) lose their step-like character and the\nplateaus are washed out. Another reason for peaks in\nthe electron transmission function (and the steps in the\nI\u2013V curves, respectively) to be eroded is the electronic\nphase-breaking effect which arises in complex molecules\ndue to stochastic fluctuations of ion potential. We conjecture, however, that at low temperatures the electronic\ndephasing reduces to same extent, so that the structure\nof T (E) can be revealed.\n\nFIG. 2:\nThe calculated electron transmission function\nthrough the bridge T (E) within a certain range of energies\nE(eV ).\n\nIn calculations we estimate EF using the expression (10)\nand we choose \u03b7 = 0.3. Matrix elements of the bridge\nHamiltonian (1) as well as the ionization energies for\nthe donor/acceptor sites are obtained from the extended\nHuckel method. The parameters \u03b3k,l representing hopping integrals for donor/acceptor chains are estimated as\naverages of matrix elements which correspond to the coupling of these sites to their nearest neighbors within the\ndonor/acceptor part of the molecule.\nComparison of our results with those obtained for I\u2013\nV curves characterizing the electric transport through\nmolecular wires [14] shows their resemblance at room\ntemperatures. At low temperatures we notice that our\nI\u2013V curves exhibit a step-like behavior and the plateaus\nget narrower as the temperature raises. Associating the\nlow-temperature I\u2013V curves with the result for the electron transmission function T (E) shown in part in Fig. 2\nwe see that the steps reflect the structure of T (E). The\nlatter is a set of peaks separated by the intervals where\nthe electron transmission function takes on values close\nto zero. These peaks arise due to the contributions from\ndifferent donor-acceptor sites as well as from the Greens\nfunction corresponding to the effective Hamiltonian for\nthe bridge. At a given voltage V the difference of the\nFermi functions in expression (9) differs from zero only\nin the interior of a certain energy range including EF .\nTherefore, the tunneling current I is fully determined by\nthe contributions of peaks of the transmission function located there. When we increase the voltage applied across\nthe bridge the width of the relevant energy range enhances, and extra peaks of the function T (E) contribute\nto the current. When a new peak appears this gives rise\nto a sudden enhancement of I, so that the step exhibited in the I \u2212 V curves reflect the structure of T (E).\nAt higher temperatures Fermi distribution functions in\n\nIn summary, we have presented a theoretical model\nfor the intramolecular ET which resembles those used\nto study the electric transport through molecular\nwires. Our model enables us to analyze in detail the\ndonor/acceptor coupling to the molecular bridge which\nis important for further investigations of long-range ET\nthrough macromolecules.\nAcknowledgments.
