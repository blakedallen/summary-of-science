ROTHSCHILD\nAbstract. We give some results concerning the smoothness of the image of a realanalytic submanifold in complex space under the action of a finite holomorphic mapping.\nFor instance, if the submanifold is not contained in a proper complex subvariety, we give a\nnecessary and sufficient condition guaranteeing that its image is smooth and the mapping\nis transversal to the image.\n\n1. Introduction and Main Results\nIn this paper, we study finite holomorphic mappings of real-analytic submanifolds in\nCN . Recall that a germ of a holomorphic mapping H : (CN , p0 ) \u2192 (CN , p\u03030 ) is finite at p0 if\nH \u22121 (p\u03030 ) \u2229 U = {p0 } for a sufficiently small open neighborhood U of p0 in CN . If V \u2282 CN\nis a germ at p0 of a real-analytic subvariety and H is a finite holomorphic mapping,\nthen its image, H(V ), is contained in a germ at p\u03030 of a real-analytic subvariety of the\nsame dimension. We consider here the case where V is a (germ at p0 of a) real-analytic\nsubmanifold and ask for geometric conditions guaranteeing that the image \u1e7c := H(V )\nis again a (germ at p\u03030 of a) submanifold and H is transversal to \u1e7c at p0 . Our main\nresult (Theorem 1.1) generalizes to higher codimension earlier work of Baouendi and the\nsecond author (see [BR92]). This study is partly motivated by the recent interest in\nthe structure of nondegenerate mappings (e.g. finite holomorphic mappings) taking one\nreal-analytic submanifold in CN into another. We mention here only the papers [ER06],\n[LM05], [KZ05], [ELZ03], [MMZ03], [MMZ02], and refer the reader to these papers for\nprecise results and a more extensive bibliography.\nBefore stating our main result, we must first introduce some notation. Let M be a\nreal-analytic submanifold of codimension d in CN with p0 \u2208 M. We let M be the usual\ncomplexification of M in some neighborhood of (p0 , p\u03040 ) in CN \u00d7 CN ; i.e. M is defined\nnear (p0 , p\u03040 ) in CN \u00d7 CN by \u03c11 (Z, \u03b6) = . . . = \u03c1d (Z, \u03b6) = 0 if M is defined near p0 by\n(1.1)\n\n\u03c11 (Z, Z\u0304) = . . . = \u03c1d (Z, Z\u0304) = 0.\n\nWe shall also associate to a holomorphic mapping H : (CN , p0 ) \u2192 (CN , p\u03030 ) its complexification H : (CN \u00d7 CN , (p0 , p\u03040 )) \u2192 (CN \u00d7 CN , (p\u03030 , p\u0303 \u03040 )) defined by H(Z, \u03b6) = (H(Z), H\u0304(\u03b6)),\nThe first author is supported in part by the NSF grant DMS-0401215.

ROTHSCHILD\n\nwhere H\u0304(\u03b6) := H(\u03b6\u0304). Observe that the mapping H sends M into another real-analytic\nf if and only if the complexified mapping H sends M to M,\nf where M\nf is\nsubmanifold M\nf. Also, observe that the mapping H is finite if and only if H\nthe complexification of M\nis finite. It is easy to check that a necessary condition for H(M) to be smooth is that\nH(M) is smooth, but the converse is not true in general. (See Remark 3.1.)\nA real-analytic submanifold M is called generic if Tp M + J(Tp M) = Tp CN for every\np \u2208 M. Here, Tp Y denotes the (real) tangent space at p to a manifold Y , and J : T CN \u2192\nT CN is the complex structure on CN . An equivalent definition can be given in terms\nof local defining equations (1.1) for M near p0 , namely \u2202\u03c11 \u2227 . . . \u2227 \u2202\u03c1d 6= 0 on M. A\ngeneric submanifold M is said to be of finite type at p0 (in the sense of Kohn and BloomGraham) if the (complex) Lie algebra gM generated by all smooth (1, 0) and (0, 1) vector\nfields tangent to M satisfies gM (p0 ) = CTp0 M, where CTp0 M is the complexified tangent\nspace to M. Recall that a germ of a smooth mapping g : (Rk , x) \u2192 (Rl , y) is said to be\ntransversal to a smooth submanifold Y \u2282 Rl at y if\n(1.2)\n\nTy Y + dg(Tx (Rk )) = Ty (Rl ).\n\nWe shall say that a holomorphic mapping H : (CN , p0 ) \u2192 (CN , p\u03030 ) is transversal to a\nf \u2282 CN at p\u03030 if it is transversal to M at 0 as a real mapreal-analytic submanifold M\n2N\n2N\nping H : (R , p0 ) \u2192 (R , p\u03030 ). Finally, the holomorphic mapping H is said to be CR\nf at p\u03030 if\ntransversal to a generic submanifold M\n(1.3)\n\nf + dH(Tp1,0CN ) = T 1,0 CN .\nTp\u03031,0\nM\np\u03030\n0\n0\n\nf denotes the the smooth (1, 0) vectors in Tp\u03030 CN that are tangent to M\nf at p\u03030 .\nHere Tp\u03031,0\nM\n0\nThe following theorem is the main result of this paper.\nTheorem 1.1. Let M be a (germ of a) real-analytic submanifold through p0 in CN and\nH : (CN , p0 ) \u2192 (CN , p\u03030 ) a germ of a finite holomorphic mapping. Consider the two properties:\n(i) The image H(M) is a germ at p\u03030 of a real-analytic submanifold.\n(ii) The complexified germ H satisfies H\u22121 (H(M)) = M, where M denotes the complexification of M.\nIf M is not contained in any proper complex analytic subvariety through p0 , then\n(1.4)\n\n(i) with H is transversal to H(M) at p\u03030 . \u21d0\u21d2 (ii)\n\nIf M is generic and of finite type at p0 , then\n(1.5)\n\n(i) with H(M) generic \u21d0\u21d2 (ii) .\n\nMoreover, in the latter case, if either (i) or (ii) is satisfied, then the image H(M) is of\nfinite type at p\u03030 , and H is CR transversal to H(M) at p\u03030 .\n\n\fIMAGES OF REAL SUBMANIFOLDS UNDER FINITE HOLOMORPHIC MAPPINGS\n\n3\n\nf is a real-analytic submanifold and H is transversal\nRemark 1.2. It is well known that if M\n\u22121\nf at p\u03030 , then H (M\nf) is necessarily a real-analytic submanifold. Moreover, if M\nf is\nto M\n\u22121\nf then H (M\nf) is generic. Theorem 1.1 can be\ngeneric and H is CR transversal to M,\nviewed as providing partial converses to these statements.\nSince a smooth real hypersurface in CN is necessarily a generic submanifold, we have the\nfollowing corollary, which shows that condition (iii) of Theorem 1 in [BR92] is extraneous.\n\nCorollary 1.3. If M is a real-analytic hypersurface of finite type at p0 in CN and\nH : (CN , p0 ) \u2192 (CN , p\u03030 ) a germ of a finite holomorphic mapping, then H(M) is a realanalytic, real submanifold if and only if H\u22121 (H(M)) = M, where M denotes the complexification of M.\nRemark 1.4. By using Theorem 4 in [BR92], we may replace (i) by the condition (i\u2032 )\nThe image H(M) is a germ at p0 of a smooth submanifold.\nRemark 1.5. If (ii) in Theorem 1.1 is satisfied, then H \u22121 (H(M)) = M. However, even\nin the case of a hypersurface, the latter condition does not imply (i) or (ii) (see Remark\n1.11 in [BR92] for an example).\nThe following example shows that the image of a generic manifold of finite type under\na finite holomorphic mapping may not be a CR manifold at 0. (Recall that M \u2282 CN\nis CR at 0 if the mapping p 7\u2192 dim T 0,1 M is constant for p in a neighborhood of 0. A\ngeneric manifold through 0 is necessarily CR at 0.) This example therefore shows that\nthe condition that H(M) is generic cannot be omitted in (1.5).\nExample 1.6. Let M \u2282 C3 be the generic hypersurface given by\n(1.6)\n\nM := {(z, w1 , w2 ) \u2208 C3 : Im w1 = |z|2 /2, Im w2 = |z|4 /2}\n\nand H = (F1 , F2 , G) : (C3 , 0) \u2192 (C3 , 0) be the finite mapping given by\n(1.7)\n\nF1 (z, w) = z, F2 (z, w) = w1 + iw2 , G(z, w) = (w1 \u2212 iw2 )2\n\nLet M \u2282 C3 be the real submanifold given by\nf := {(e\n(1.8)\nM\nz1 , ze2 , w)\ne \u2208 C3 : w\ne = (e\nz 2 + i|e\nz1 |2 + |e\nz1 |4 )2 }.\n\nf is not CR at 0. One can check by direct calculation that\nIt is easily checked that M\nf. To see that H maps M onto M\nf, let (e\nf. Taking z 0 :=\nH(M) \u2282 M\nz10 , ze20 , w\ne0 ) \u2208 M\nze10 , Re w10 = Re ze20 + |e\nz10 |4 /2, Re w20 = Im ze20 \u2212 |e\nz10 |2 /2, we have F1 (z 0 , w 0 ) = ze10 and\n0\n0\n0\nF1 (z , w ) = ze2 , which proves the desired surjectivity.\n\nNote that C3 is the lowest dimensional complex space in which one can find an example\nof the above type. Indeed, for a generic submanifold in C2 to be of finite type at a point,\nit must be a real hypersurface, so this case is covered by Corollary 1.3. However, a totally\nreal generic submanifold in C2 can be mapped onto a nongeneric submanifold in C2 , as\nis shown by the following example.\n\n\f4\n\nP. EBENFELT AND L. P. ROTHSCHILD\n\nExample 1.7. Let\nM := {(w1 , w2 ) \u2208 C2 : Im w1 = Im w2 = 0}\n\nand let H(w1 , w2 ) := (w1 + iw2 , (w1 \u2212 iw2 )2 ). Then H is finite, and H maps M onto the\nsurface\nf := {e\nM\nz , w)\ne \u2208 C2 : w = z 2 },\nwhich again is not CR at 0 and hence not generic.\nExample 1.8. If M is contained in a complex analytic subvariety, then the implication\n\u21d0 in (1.4) does not hold in general. Consider M \u2282 C2 given by z2 = 0 and the mapping\nH(z1 , z2 ) = (z1 , z22 ). Observe that the complexification M \u2282 C2 \u00d7 C2 of M is the submanifold of points (z1 , z2 , \u03b61 , \u03b62) such that z2 = \u03b62 = 0, and the complexified map is given\nby H(z, \u03b6) = (z1 , z22 , \u03b61 , \u03b622). Clearly, we have H\u22121 (H(M)) = M. The image M\u0303 := H(M)\nis a submanifold at 0 (i.e. (i)), but H is not transverse to M\u0303 at 0. However, we do not\nknow of any examples where (ii) holds, but (i) does not. For further discussion about this\npoint, see Section 4 of this paper.\nAs mentioned above, Theorem 1.1 generalizes and sharpens a theorem of Baouendi and\nthe second author (see [BR92], Theorem 1, part (B)) for the case where M is an essentially\nfinite real-analytic hypersurface. We should also point out that the conclusion in Theorem\n1.1 that H is CR transversal to H(M), when M is generic and of finite type, provided\nthat H(M) is a generic manifold, was proved in a recent paper [ER06] (see Theorem 1.1)\nby the authors. We conclude the introduction by mentioning two corollaries concerning\nranks of finite holomorphic mappings that follow from Theorem 1.1.\nCorollary 1.9. Let M be a real-analytic generic submanifold of finite type through p0 in\nCN , and H : (CN , p0 ) \u2192 (CN , p\u03030 ) a germ of a finite holomorphic mapping. Let M and H\ndenote the complexifications of M and H, respectively. If H\u22121 (H(M)) = M, then\n\n\u2202H\n(p0 ) \u2265 codim M,\n\u2202Z\nwhere rk denotes the rank of a matrix and codim M is the real codimension of M in CN .\n(1.9)\n\nrk\n\nBy combining Theorem 1.1 above with a theorem from [ER06], we obtain, as a corollary,\na sufficient geometric condition for a finite mapping to be a local biholomorphism at a\ngiven point. For this recall that M is said to be finitely nondegenerate at p0 if\n\u001a \u0012 j\u0013\n\u001b\n\u2202\u03c1\n\u03b1\nn\n(1.10)\nspanC L\n(p0 ) : j = 1, . . . , d, \u03b1 \u2208 N+ = CN ,\n\u2202Z\nwhere spanC denotes the vector space spanned over C and L\u03b1 := L\u03b11 1 . . . L\u03b1nn . Here,\nL1 , . . . , Ln is a basis for the smooth (0, 1) (or CR) vector fields tangent to M near p0 , and\nM is defined locally near p0 by (1.1). A direct consequence of Theorem 1.1 above and\nTheorem 1.2 in [ER06] is the following result.\n\n\fIMAGES OF REAL SUBMANIFOLDS UNDER FINITE HOLOMORPHIC MAPPINGS\n\n5\n\nCorollary 1.10. Let M, M, H, and H be as in Corollary 1.9. Assume, in addition, that\nM is finitely nondegenerate at p0 . If H\u22121 (H(M)) = M, then H is a local biholomorphism\nat p0 .\n2. Images of complex manifolds under finite mappings\nThe study of images of complex analytic manifolds and varieties under finite holomorphic mappings has a long history (see e.g. [Rem57], [GR65], [GH94], [Rud80]). The proof\nof Theorem 1.1 is mainly based on the following result concerning images of complex\nmanifolds.\nTheorem 2.1. Let X be a complex submanifold through 0 in Ck and f : (Ck , 0) \u2192 (Ck , 0)\na germ of a finite holomorphic mapping such that\n(2.1)\n\ndet\n\n\u2202f\n\u2202z\n\nX\n\n6\u2261 0,\n\nwhere z = (z1 , . . . , zk ) are coordinates in Ck . Then, the following are equivalent:\n(a) f (X) is a germ of a manifold at 0 and f is transversal to f (X).\n(b) f \u22121 (f (X)) = X as germs at 0.\nRemark 2.2. Without the assumption (2.1), condition (b) in Theorem 2.1 does not imply\nthat f is transversal to f (X), as is shown by the example given in Remark 1.8 above. We\ndo not know if condition (b) implies that f (X) is a manifold without assuming (2.1). If\nX is of dimension one, then it is shown in Theorem 4.1 below that in fact (b) does imply\nthat f (X) is a manifold even without assuming (2.1).\nRemark 2.3. We note that without the condition of transversality in (a), condition (b)\nneed not hold. For example, consider X = {(z, w) : w = 0} and the mapping f (z, w) =\n(z 2 + w 2 , zw). It can be easily checked that f (X) = X, but f \u22121 (f (X)) 6= X.\nProof of Theorem 2.1. The proof of (a) =\u21d2 (b) is immediate by the transversality assumption (without using (2.1)). We shall prove (b) =\u21d2 (a). We first observe that, by\nthe proper mapping theorem, f (X) is a complex analytic (irreducible) subvariety, of the\nsame dimension as X, through 0 in Ck . Let q be the codimension of X in Ck . We choose\nlocal coordinates (x, y) \u2208 Cp \u00d7 Cq , with p + q = k, vanishing at the origin in Ck such that\nX is given locally by y = 0.\nOur first claim is that the coordinate functions yl , l = 1, . . . , q, belong to the ideal\nI(f (x, y)). If m denotes the multiplicity at the origin of the finite mapping f : Ck \u2192 Ck ,\nthen assertion (b) implies that the m points (counted with their multiplicities) in f \u22121 (w),\nfor an arbitrary w \u2208 f (X) sufficiently close to the origin, are all contained in X = {(x, 0)}.\nMoreover, it follows from the condition (2.1) that these m preimages will all be distinct\n(multiplicity one) for a set of w which is open and dense in the variety f (X). (The set\nof points w in f (X) for which f \u22121 ({w}) consists of fewer than m points is contained in\n\n\f6\n\nP. EBENFELT AND L. P. ROTHSCHILD\n\nthe image of {z : det(\u2202f /\u2202z)(z) = 0}, which by the assumption (2.1) does not contain\nX.) Thus, if we let h : (Cp , 0) \u2192 (Ck , 0) denote the holomorphic mapping defined by\nh(x) = f (x, 0), then for an open and dense set of w \u2208 f (X) there are m preimages of w\nunder h. It follows (see e.g. Proposition 1 on p. 94 in [AGZV85]; see also Proposition 2.4\non p. 168 of [GG73]) that the multiplicity of h at 0 is at least m, i.e.\n(2.2)\n\nm \u2264 dimC C{x}/I(f (x, 0)),\n\nwhere C{x} denotes the ring of convergent power series in x (or ring of germs at 0 of\nholomorphic functions in Cp ). Consider the homomorphism \u03c6 : C{x, y} \u2192 C{x} defined\nby \u03c6(g)(x) = g(x, 0). Clearly, \u03c6 is surjective and sends I(f (x, y)) into I(f (x, 0)). Hence,\n\u03c6 induces a surjective homomorphism \u03c6\u2217 : C{x, y}/I(f (x, y)) \u2192 C{x}/I(f (x, 0)), so that\ndimC C{x}/I(f (x, 0)) \u2264 m. On the other hand, m is the multiplicity of the finite mapping\nf , i.e.\n(2.3)\n\nm = dimC C{x, y}/I(f (x, y)),\n\nand hence, by (2.2), we must have that\n(2.4)\n\ndimC C{x}/I(f (x, 0)) = dimC C{x, y}/I(f (x, y))\n\nand \u03c6\u2217 is an isomorphism. Since \u03c6\u2217 (yl ) = 0, for l = 1, . . . , q, we conclude that\n(2.5)\n\nyl \u2208 I(f (x, y)),\n\nl = 1, . . . , q,\n\nas claimed above.\nNotice that as a consequence of (2.5), \u2202f /\u2202y(0) has rank q. After a linear invertible\ntransformation in the target space Ck (if necessary), we can decompose its coordinates\nas w = (\u03be, \u03b7) \u2208 Cp \u00d7 Cq and write the mapping f (x, y) as f (x, y) = (R(x, y), S(x, y))t,\nwhere R = (R1 , . . . , Rp )t , S = (S1 . . . , Sq )t , and\n(2.6)\n\n\u2202R\n(0) = 0p\u00d7q ,\n\u2202y\n\n\u2202S\n(0) = Iq\u00d7q ,\n\u2202y\n\nwhere 0p\u00d7q denotes the (p \u00d7 q)-matrix whose entries are all 0 and Iq\u00d7q the (q \u00d7 q) identity\nmatrix. Hence, we can further write the components of the mapping as\n(2.7)\n\nR(x, y) = R0 (x) + R1 (x, y)y,\n\nS(x, y) = y + S0 (x) + S1 (x, y)y,\n\nwhere R1 (x, y) and S1 (x, y) are (p \u00d7 q)-matrix and (q \u00d7 q)-matrix valued functions, respectively, with R1 (0) = 0 and S1 (0) = 0. Observe that the restriction to y = 0 is given\nby h(x) = f (x, 0) = (R0 (x), S0 (x))t .\nLemma 2.4. With the notation introduced above, the germ at 0 of the holomorphic mapping R0 : (Cp , 0) \u2192 (Cp , 0) is finite with multiplicity m and\n(2.8)\n\nS0 (x) = g(R0 (x)),\n\n\fIMAGES OF REAL SUBMANIFOLDS UNDER FINITE HOLOMORPHIC MAPPINGS\n\n7\n\nwhere g : (Cp , 0) \u2192 (Cq , 0) is the germ of the holomorphic mapping that satisfies\nm\n\n(2.9)\n\ng(\u03be) :=\n\n1 X\nS0 (x\u03bd (\u03be))\nm \u03bd=1\n\nfor a generic point \u03be \u2208 Cp ; here, x\u03bd (\u03be) denote the m distinct preimages of \u03be under the\nmapping R0 .\nProof of Lemma 2.4. In view of (2.5), we have\n(2.10)\n\ny = A(x, y)R(x, y) + B(x, y)S(x, y),\n\nfor some matrix valued functions A, B. If we Taylor expand A(x, y) and B(x, y) in y,\nwriting A(x, y) = A0 (x) + O(y) and B(x, y) = B0 (x) + O(y), we conclude by substituting\n(2.7) into (2.10) and setting x = 0 that\n(2.11)\n\nB0 (0) = Iq\u00d7q .\n\nSimilarly, by setting y = 0 we obtain\n(2.12)\n\nA0 (x)R0 (x) + B0 (x)S0 (x) = 0.\n\nIt follows from (2.11) that B0 (x) is invertible near 0 and therefore, by (2.12), the components of S0 (x) are in the ideal I(R0 (x)). In other words, we have I(f (x, 0)) = I(R0 (x)).\nThus, by (2.4) the number m of preimages of a generic w \u2208 f (X) under h : (Cp , 0) \u2192\n(Ck , 0) is also the multiplicity of the mapping R0 : (Cp , 0) \u2192 (Cp , 0) as claimed in the\nlemma. If we write w = (\u03be, \u03b7) \u2208 Cp \u00d7 Cq for a point in f (X), then for generic \u03be we have\n(2.13)\n\n\u03b7 = S0 (x\u03bd (\u03be)),\n\n\u03bd = 1, . . . , m.\n\nIf we define g by (2.9), then g extends to a holomorphic function near 0, since it is a\nsymmetric function of the roots x1 , . . . xm , and (2.8) can be verified directly from (2.13).\n\u0003\nWe may now complete the proof of Theorem 2.1. Let g be as in Lemma 2.4. If we make\nthe change of variables\n(2.14)\n\n\u03be \u2032 = \u03be,\n\nin the target space Ck then by writing\n\n\u03b7 \u2032 = \u03b7 \u2212 g(\u03be)\n\ng(R0 (x) + R1 (x, y)y) = g(R0 (x)) + O(|x| + |y|)y\n\nand using Lemma 2.4, the mapping f (x, y) takes the form\n(2.15)\n\nf (x, y) = (R0 (x) + R1 (x, y)y, y + S\u03031 (x, y)y)t,\n\nwhere S\u03031 (x, y) is a (q \u00d7 q)-matrix-valued function with S\u03031 (0) = 0. By (2.15), the qdimensional complex subvariety f (X), where X = {y = 0}, is contained in the qdimensional plane {\u03b7 \u2032 = 0} in Ck . This proves that f (X) = {\u03b7 \u2032 = 0} and hence is a\n\n\f8\n\nP. EBENFELT AND L. P. ROTHSCHILD\n\nsubmanifold at 0. It is obvious from the form (2.15) of the mapping that f is transversal\nto f (X). This completes the proof of Theorem 2.1.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.5. The condition (2.1) in Theorem 2.1 is only used to deduce that the generic\nnumber of preimages of the mapping f |X : (X, 0) \u2192 (f (X), 0) equals the multiplicity of\nthe mapping f : (Ck , 0) \u2192 (Ck , 0). In fact, these two properties are equivalent as the\nreader can verify.\n3. Proof of Theorem 1.1\nProof. Without loss of generality, we may take p0 = p\u03030 = 0. We assume first that M\nis a real analytic submanifold that is not contained in any proper complex subvariety of\nf := H(M) is a germ\nCN . To prove the implication =\u21d2 of (1.4), we suppose that M\nat 0 of a real-analytic submanifold and that H is transversal to H(M) at 0. Observe\nf is of the same dimension as M, since H is a finite mapping. If \u03c1\u0303(Z, Z\u0304), where\nthat M\nf, then the fact that H is transversal implies\n\u03c1\u0303 = (\u03c1\u03031 , . . . , \u03c1\u0303d ), is a defining function for M\nthat \u03c1(Z, Z\u0304) := \u03c1\u0303(H(Z), H\u0304(Z\u0304)) is a defining function for M. By simply replacing Z\u0304 by \u03b6\nf = M which is the assertion (ii).\nin the above, we conclude that H\u22121 (M)\nTo prove the implication \u21d0= in (1.4), we shall need the observation that\ndet\n\n\u2202H\n\u2202(Z, \u03b6)\n\nM\n\n6\u2261 0.\n\nIndeed, if det( \u2202H/\u2202(Z, \u03b6))|M \u2261 0, then by the specific form of H it would follow that\n|det( \u2202H/\u2202Z)|M |2 \u2261 0 contradicting the assumptions that H is finite and M is not contained in a proper complex analytic subvariety. We may now apply Theorem 2.1 with\nf := H(M) is a germ at 0 of a manifold with H\nX := M and f := H to conclude that M\nf at 0. Since H is finite, M\nf has the same dimension as M. Moreover, M\nf\ntransversal to M\nf then (\u03b6\u0304, Z\u0304) \u2208 M.\nf The latter is easily verisatisfies the \"reality\" symmetry: if (Z, \u03b6) \u2208 M,\nfied (and the verification is left to the reader) from the fact that M has this symmetry, by\nusing the specific form of H. The symmetry implies that one can find defining equations\nf near 0 of the form \u03c1\u0303(Z, \u03b6) = 0, where \u03c1\u0303 = (\u03c1\u03031 , . . . , \u03c1\u0303d ), and for each 1 \u2264 j \u2264 d we\nfor M\nhave \u03c1\u0303j (Z, Z\u0304) is real-valued. It follows that the real-valued equation \u03c1\u0303(Z, Z\u0304) = 0 defines\nf \u2282 CN through 0 of codimension d. By construction, H\na real-analytic submanifold M\nf We must show that H sends M onto M\nf in the sense of germs at 0. The\nsends M into M.\nf at 0 means that \u03c1(Z, \u03b6) := \u03c1\u0303(H(Z), H\u0304(\u03b6)) is a defining\nfact that H is transversal to M\nfunction for M at 0. Clearly, this also means that \u03c1(Z, Z\u0304) is a defining function for M at\nf) = M as germs at 0. Since any representative of the germ H near\n0 and, hence, H \u22121 (M\nf as germs at 0. This completes the\n0 is an open mapping, we conclude that H(M) = M\nproof of the implication \u21d0= in (1.4).\nTo complete the proof of Theorem 1.1, assume that M is a generic submanifold of finite\ntype at 0. We shall show that (1.5) holds. Note first that M generic implies that M is not\n\n\fIMAGES OF REAL SUBMANIFOLDS UNDER FINITE HOLOMORPHIC MAPPINGS\n\n9\n\ncontained in any proper complex submanifold of CN . It follows from (1.4) that (ii) =\u21d2\n(i) and H is transversal to H(M) at 0. As above, we note that \u03c1(Z, Z\u0304) = \u03c1\u0303(H(Z), H(Z)),\nwhere \u03c1\u0303(Z, Z\u0304) is a defining function for H(M) near 0, is a defining function for M near\n0. Now, by the chain rule\n\u2202\u03c1\n\u2202 \u03c1\u0303\n\u2202H\n(0) =\n(0)\n(0)\n\u2202Z\n\u2202Z\n\u2202Z\nand, hence, the rank of (\u2202 \u03c1\u0303/\u2202Z)(0) must be d since M is generic. Consequently, H(M)\nis generic.\nf := H(M) be a generic submanifold. It follows\nFor the implication =\u21d2 in (1.5), let M\nf is of finite type at 0, since H is finite. Finally,\nfrom Proposition 2.3 in [ER06] that M\nf at 0, by Theorem 1.1 of\nthe mapping H is CR transversal (and hence transversal) to M\n[ER06]. The rest of the proof of (1.5) now follows from (1.4).\n\u0003\nRemark 3.1. To prove that H(M) is smooth in the proof above, we have used not only\nthat H(M) is smooth but also that H is transversal to H(M). In general, H(M) smooth\ndoes not imply that H(M) is smooth. For instance, consider M = R in C and the mapping\nz 7\u2192 z 2 . However, the reverse implication does hold, i.e. if H(M) is smooth, then H(M)\nis also smooth.\n4. Further results on images of curves under finite mappings\nIn this section, we shall address the following question, which was alluded to above.\nQuestion: Let X be a complex submanifold through 0 in Ck , and f : (Ck , 0) \u2192 (Ck , 0) a\ngerm of a finite holomorphic mapping. Does the identity f \u22121 (f (X)) = X, as germs at 0,\nimply that f (X) is a submanifold at 0?\nAn equivalent formulation can be given as follows:\nQuestion\u2032 : Let X\u0303 be a complex submanifold through 0 in Ck , and f : (Ck , 0) \u2192 (Ck , 0) a\ngerm of a finite holomorphic mapping. Assume that X := f \u22121 (X\u0303) is a submanifold at 0.\nDoes this imply that X\u0303 is a submanifold at 0?\nAs mentioned above, we do not know the answer in general. However, the answer for\none-dimensional submanifolds is affirmative in view of the following result.\nTheorem 4.1. Let X be a complex submanifold of dimension one (i.e. a smooth complex\ncurve) through 0 in Ck and f : (Ck , 0) \u2192 (Ck , 0) a germ of a finite holomorphic mapping.\nIf f \u22121 (f (X)) = X as germs at 0, then X\u0303 := f (X) is a germ at 0 of a submanifold.\nAn equivalent formulation of this result in the spirit of the second formulation of the\nquestion above is the following.\n\n\f10\n\nP. EBENFELT AND L. P. ROTHSCHILD\n\nTheorem 4.2. Let X\u0303 be a complex subvariety of dimension one (i.e. a complex curve)\nthrough 0 in Ck and f : (Ck , 0) \u2192 (Ck , 0) a germ of a finite holomorphic mapping. If\nX := f \u22121 (X\u0303) is a germ at 0 of a submanifold (i.e. a smooth curve), then X\u0303 is also a\nsubmanifold (i.e a smooth curve) at 0.\nProof of Theorem 4.1. Let Z = (z, w) \u2208 C \u00d7 Ck\u22121 be local coordinates at 0 in which\nX = {(z, w) : w = 0}. We also choose coordinates Z\u0303 at 0 in the target copy of Ck such\nthat, after possibly another change of coordinates in the z variable,\n(4.1)\n\ng(z) := f (z, 0) = (z m , f2 (z, 0), . . . , fk (z, 0)),\n\nwhere fj (z, 0) = O(z m ) for j = 2, . . . , k. We expand the fj (z, 0), j = 2, . . . , k, in their\nTaylor series\n(4.2)\n\nfj (z, 0) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\najl z l ,\n\nj = 2, . . . , k.\n\nl=1\n\nWe define\n(4.3)\n\nq := gcd(m, {l : a1l 6= 0}, . . . , {l : akl 6= 0}),\n\nwhere gcd(n1 , n2 , . . .) denotes the greatest common divisor of the numbers n1 , n2 , . . .. We\nobserve that there are holomorphic functions hj (z), for j = 2, . . . , k, such that\n(4.4)\n\nfj (z, 0) = hj (z q ),\n\nj = 2, . . . , k.\n\nWe claim that, for any t 6= 0, the preimages of g(t) are {\u01eb0 t, . . . , \u01ebq\u22121 t}, where \u01eb0 , . . . , \u01ebq\u22121\nare the qth roots of unity. The fact that all the points \u01ebj t, j = 0, . . . , q \u2212 1, are preimages\nis clear from the definition of q and (4.4). Conversely, if z0 is a preimage of g(t0 ) for some\nt0 6= 0, then z0 = \u01ebt0 for some mth root of unity \u01eb. Since the only possible preimages of a\npoint g(t) with t close to t0 are of the form z = \u03b4t for some mth root of unity \u03b4, we conclude\nthat z = \u01ebt is a preimage of g(t) for all t near t0 . Hence, we have fj (\u01ebt, 0) = fj (t, 0) for\nj = 2, . . . , k, which implies\n(4.5)\n\n\u221e\nX\nl=1\n\nl l\n\najl \u01eb t =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\najl tl ,\n\nj = 2, . . . , k,\n\nl=1\n\nfor t near t0 . Consequently, \u01ebl = 1 for all l such that ajl 6= 0 for some j = 2, . . . , k. Since\n\u01ebm = 1 as well, we conclude that \u01ebq = 1, where q is as defined in (4.3). This proves the\nclaim above.\nIf q = m, then it is clear that X\u0303 is smooth at 0. Thus, to complete the proof of Theorem\n4.1 it suffices to assume that 1 \u2264 q < m and show that f \u22121 (f (X)) contains but is not\nequal to X. This is an immediate consequence of the following lemma, since f (t, 0) is\nO(tm ) and q < m.\n\u0003\n\n\fIMAGES OF REAL SUBMANIFOLDS UNDER FINITE HOLOMORPHIC MAPPINGS\n\n11\n\nLemma 4.3.

Since all the preimages of f (t, 0), for (t, 0) \u2208 X,\nare assumed to lie on X and, hence are of the form (\u01ebi t, 0) with \u01ebqi = 1 for i = 0, 1, . . . , q\u22121,\nwe conclude that\nF j (f (t, 0)) = (cj tj , 0),\n\n(4.7)\n\nj = 1, . . . , p,\n\nfor some constants cj .

Furthermore, by the wellknown theorem of elementary invariant theory (see e.g. [BER99], Theorem 5.3.4), if d(w)\nis any polynomial invariant under all permutations of w, then there is a polynomial\na(b1 , . . . , bp ) such that\n(4.12)\n\nd(w) = a(c1 (w), . . . , cp (w))\n\nIn view of the homogeneity of the ci (w), it follows from (4.12) that if dq (w) is homogeneous\nof degree q, then there is a polynomial aq (b1 , . . . , bq ) (necessarily of degree \u2264 q and with\nno constant term) such that\n(4.13)\n\nPp\n\ndq (w) = aq (c1 (w), . . . , cq (w))\n\nq\nNow take dq (w) :=\ni=1 wi . If wi = \u01ebi is a q-root of unity for i = 1, . . . p, then\ndq (\u01eb1 , . . . , \u01ebp ) = p, and, in particular, is not zero. It follows from (4.13) that cj0 ((\u01eb1 , . . . , \u01ebp ) 6=\n0 for some j0 with 1 \u2264 j0 \u2264 q. Therefore, since all the roots of Q(y) given by (4.10) are\nassumed to be q-roots of unity, it follows that the coefficient ej0 of Q(y) is not zero. This\nproves Lemma 4.4.\n\u0003\n\nTo complete the proof of Lemma 4.3, we set y = x/t in (4.9) and define Q(y) :=\nR(t, ty)/tp , i.e.\n(4.14)\n\nQ(y) = y p + c1 y p\u22121 + . . . + cp\u22121 y + cp .\n\nAll the roots of Q(y) are q-roots of unity by construction. By Lemma 4.4, there is\n1 \u2264 j \u2264 q such that cj 6= 0. This proves Lemma 4.3.\n\u0003\nWe conclude this paper by giving an equivalent algebraic reformulation of the question\nposed in the beginning of this section. Let I be an ideal in C{Z}. \u221a\nRecall that I is the\nideal of a complex analytic subvariety X at 0 if and only if I = I, i.e I is radical.\nThe subvariety X is a submanifold at 0 if and only if the ring C{Z}/I is regular, i.e.\nisomorphic to a power series ring C{t}.\nQuestion\u2032\u2032 : Let \u03c6 : C{x1 , . . . , xk } \u2192 C{z1 , . . . , zk } be an injective C-algebra homomorphism such that C{z1 , . . . , zk } is integral over \u03c6(C{x1 , . . . , xk }). Let I be a radical ideal\nin C{x1 , . . . , xk\u221a} and J the ideal in C{z1 , . . . , zk } generated by \u03c6(I). Assume that the ring\nC{z1 , . . . , zk }/ J is regular. Does this imply that C{x1 , . . . , xk }/I is regular?\n\nIn this formulation, the answer is negative if the field of complex numbers is replaced by\nany field of characteristic 0 < p < \u221e in view of the following example, communicated to us\nby Joseph Lipman, who attributed it to Melvin Hochster. Let K be a field of characteristic\np and consider the homomorphism \u03c6 : K{u, v, w} \u2192 K{x, y, z} given by u 7\u2192 xp , v 7\u2192 y p ,\nand w 7\u2192 z. If we let I be the (prime) ideal generated by w p + uv, then J is the\u221aideal\ngenerated by z p + xp y p , which in characteristic\u221ap is equal to (z + xy)p . The radical J is\nthen generated by z + xy, and C{z1 , . . . , zk }/ J is regular. However, C{x1 , . . . , xk }/I is\n\n\fIMAGES OF REAL SUBMANIFOLDS UNDER FINITE HOLOMORPHIC MAPPINGS\n\n13\n\nnot regular. Another counterexample (in characteristic 3) was attributed to Bill Heinzer.\nLipman also informed us that he has an algebraic proof [L06] showing that if \"regular\" in\nQuestion\u2032\u2032 above is replaced by \"normal\", then the answer is affirmative (indeed, he proved\nthis statement in a more general context). For an ideal I for which dim C{z1 , . . . , zk }/I =\n1, normal is the same as regular and, hence, Lipman's arguments yield another proof of\nTheorem 4.2 above. We would like to take this opportunity to thank the above mentioned\npeople for their help and interest in our question.\n5.
