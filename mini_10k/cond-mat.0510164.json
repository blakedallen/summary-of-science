susceptibility, \u03c7(T ), is investigated for\none-dimensional interacting electron systems at quarter-filling within the Kadanoff-Wilson\nrenormalization-group method. The forward scattering on the same branch (the g4 -process)\nis examined together with the backward (g1 ) and forward (g2 ) scattering amplitudes on opposite branches. In connection with lattice models, we show that \u03c7(T ) is strongly enhanced by the\nnearest-neighbor interaction, an enhancement that surpasses one of the next-nearest-neighbor\ninteraction. A connection between our predictions for \u03c7(T ) and experimental results for \u03c7(T )\nin quasi-one-dimensional organic conductors is presented.\nKEYWORDS: magnetic susceptibility, renormalization group, long-range Coulomb interaction, extendedHubbard model, quarter-filling, one-dimension, (TMTTF)2 X, (TMTSF)2 X\n\nIn low dimensional conductors, the influence of longrange Coulomb interactions, or the off-site interaction V 's are known to lead to various interesting ordered states, such as charge ordering1 and spin-density\nwave (SDW) state coexisting with charge-density wave\n(CDW).2, 3 At the present stage, however, the effect of\nV 's is not clearly understood compared with that of the\non-site repulsion U . The purpose of this letter is to analyze the effect of V 's on the quasi-one-dimensional conductor in the normal state by calculating the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility \u03c7(T ) for\nthe one-dimensional system at quarter-filling. The results\nshed some light on the magnetic properties of both normal and ordered states in these kinds of materials.\nA lot of studies of \u03c7(T ) were devoted to the onedimensional (1D) Hubbard model, i.e., for V 's = 0. The\nBethe ansatz gives us an exact solution, but \u03c7 only at\nT = 0 is available for the 1D Hubbard model.4 The temperature dependence of \u03c7 can be extracted from numerical simulations but only at high temperatures.5 For U\nsmaller than the bandwidth, the renormalization-group\n(RG) approach gives results that quantitatively agree\nwith both the exact solution at T = 0 and the numerical solutions at high temperatures.5 In the presence of\nV 's, however, there is no exact solution, and the size of\nnumerical simulations becomes exceedingly large. These\ntechniques are then of limited use to investigate the effect\nof V 's.\nIn this letter, we use the RG technique to calculate\n\u03c7(T ) for the full temperature range from zero to the\nbandwidth E0 in the presence of V 's (> 0). Considering the possible interactions for branches of right and\nleft going electrons in the continuum limit, we take into\naccount the forward scattering on the same branch (SB),\ndenoted as the g4 -process, with the backward (g1 ) and\nforward (g2 ) scattering processes on opposite branches.\nThis is the first derivation of the RG flows of the sets\nof coupling constants and \u03c7(T ) at the one-loop level in\u2217 E-mail\n\ncluding the non-logarithmic channels for particles on the\nSB, which become important at finite-temperatures.\nOur main results are: 1) \u03c7(T ) is noticeably enhanced at\nfinite temperature by the nearest-neighbor repulsion (V1 )\ncompared with the next-nearest-neighbor repulsion (V2 );\n2) \u03c7(T = 0) is not simply proportional to the inverse of\nthe ordinary spin-velocity v\u03c3 ; 3) \u03c7(T ) is reduced by a\nmoderately large V2 due to the CDW fluctuations.\nWe consider the quarter-filled extended-Hubbard\nmodel in 1D with the Hamiltonian H = H0 + HI , where\ni\nXh \u2020\nH0 = \u2212t\nci+1,\u03c3 ci,\u03c3 + h.c. ,\n(1)\ni,\u03c3\n\nHI =\n\nX\n\n[U ni\u2191 ni\u2193 + V1 ni ni+1 + V2 ni ni+2 ] .\n\n(2)\n\ni\n\n(\u2020)\n\nHere t denotes the intrachain hopping integral, ci,\u03c3 as an\nannihilation (a creation) operator on the i-th site with\nspin \u03c3 (=\u2191, \u2193). The density operators are ni,\u03c3 = c\u2020i,\u03c3 ci,\u03c3\nand ni = ni\u2191 + ni\u2193 . In weak-coupling regions, Eq.

The\nSB channels become finite due to thermal particle-hole\nexcitations, i.e., E0 (l)/4 \u223c T .\nBy setting ISB (l) = 0 and ICP (l) = 1, Eqs. (11)(14) reproduce the previous RG equations which treat\nonly the Cooper and Peierls contractions.6, 7 Equations\n(11)-(14) are the full RG equations at the one-loop level.\nHere, \"full\" means they include not only the logarithmic (Cooper and Peierls) channels, but also the nonlogarithmic (SB) channel. By considering the contribution of ISB , the renormalization of g4\u03c1,4\u03c3 and their influence on the charge- and magnetic-susceptibility is obtained. In Eqs. (11)-(14), they apparently imply that the\nspin- and charge-part are coupled together. However, the\ncontribution of the SB channel, ISB (l), is small compared\nto that of the logarithmic term, ICP (l), so that the coupling of spin- and charge-part is very weak. Further, at\nthe ground state, the present flow equations exhibit the\nspin-charge decoupling since ISB (l) = 0 at T = 0.\nThe uniform magnetic susceptibility \u03c7(T ) can be calculated by introducing a Zeeman coupling between a\nsource field hp (q)Pand the spin-density variable Sp (q).\nBy adding Hh = q,p z\u03c3 hp (q)Sp (q) to the Hamiltonian,\nthe uniform magnetic susceptibility can be obtained and\nwhich leads,\nZ \u221e\n2\n2\n\u03c7(T ) =\n[z\u03c3 (l)] ISB (l)dl,\n(16)\n\u03c0vF 0\nwhere z\u03c3 (l) is the pair vertex part and is calculated from\n1\nd\nz\u03c3 (l) = z\u03c3 (l) [\u2212G\u03c3 (l) + G4\u22a5 (l)] ISB (l),\ndl\n2\n\n(17)\n\nwith\n1\n[G4\u03c1 (l) \u2212 G4\u03c3 (l)],\n(18)\n2\nand the initial condition z\u03c3 (0) = 1 [see Fig. 1 (e)].\nThe flows of the couplings as a function of energy at\nT = 0.01t are shown in Fig. 2. We show results for the\nfollowing different sets of parameters; (i) (U, V1 , V2 ) =\n(2t, 0, 0), (ii) (U, V1 , V2 ) = (2t, t, 0) and (iii) (U, V1 , V2 ) =\n(2t, 0, t). Note that for the cases (i) and (ii), the SDW\nbecomes dominant, while both the SDW and CDW are\nenhanced for the case (iii). Generally, for E0 (l)/4 & T ,\nG\u03c3 (l) follows G\u03c3 (l) = G\u03c3 (0)/ [1 + G\u03c3 (0) ln(E0 (l)/E0 )],\nas found in the conventional RG. With decreasing E0 (l),\nG4\u22a5 (l) \u2261\n\n\fJ.

However, the G4\u22a5 's [plots (i'), (ii') & (iii')] keep their initial\nvalues until E0 (l) decreases to E0 (l)/4 \u223c T . Around\nE0 (l)/4 \u223c T , the SB channel becomes effective while the\ncontributions of the Cooper and Peierls channels to the\nflow are strongly suppressed. As a result, the SB channel slightly enhances |G\u03c3 | and remarkably reduces G4\u22a5\n[plots (ii) & (ii')] for finite V1 . For finite V2 , G4\u22a5 [plot\n(iii')] is reduced further. The contribution of the SB channel is relatively small for the Hubbard model (V1,2 = 0)\n[plots (i) & (i')]. As shown later, the properties of \u03c7(T )\nare directly affected by the temperature dependence of\nG\u03c3 and G4\u22a5 .\nThe temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility \u03c7(T ) is shown in Fig. 3. The result for the Hubbard model (U = 2t) given by the plot (i) is quantitatively consistent with \u03c7(T ) calculated by the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations.5 The value at\n\n3\n\nT = 0, \u03c7(0)t = 0.58, agrees well with the exact solution, \u03c7exact (0)t = 0.57, for U = 2t.4 Near zero temperature, \u03c7(T ) decreases as d\u03c7/dT \u2192 \u221e for plots (i)\nand (ii), which has also been pointed out in the context of the Heisenberg spin chain.9 This logarithmic decrease of \u03c7(T \u223c 0) is due to the logarithmic decrease of\n|G\u03c3 |.5 Note that for large U , e.g., U & 4t, there was\na sizable difference between the previous \u03c7(T ) of the\nRG approach5 and the \u03c7(T ) of the QMC calculation at\nhigh temperatures. The difference is much reduced by\nthe present RG calculation due to taking account of the\nnon-logarithmic terms (the SB channels), which become\nimportant at high temperatures. It is expected that such\na difference is further reduced by the modified-Kanamori\napproach,5 which is not applicable at low temperatures\nbut gives better agreement with \u03c7QMC (T ) at high temperatures. In the present calculation, we take the linearized (continuum) dispersion, in which lattice effects,\ncoming from the use of the full tight binding spectrum\n\u01ebp (k) = \u22122t [cos(k) \u2212 cos(kF )], are neglected. When the\nlattice effects are considered in the calculation of ISB (l),\nthere appears a slight dip around T \u223c 0.1t.5 For U = 2V2\n[plot (iii)] corresponding to the boundary between SDW\nand CDW, G\u03c3 is invariant due to G\u03c3 (0) = 0, so that\nd\u03c7/dT is constant at low temperatures as for an ordinary paramagnetic metal. For U < 2V2 [plot (iv)], \u03c7 is\nreduced to zero at T \u226a t due to the CDW state.\nIt is noticed that \u03c7(T ) is much enhanced by V1 compared with V2 at finite temperatures. This difference originates from the degree of the renormalization of G4\u22a5 . As\nseen in Fig. 2, in the presence of V1 , the reduction of\nG4\u22a5 [plot (ii')] due to the SB channel is smaller than\nthat in the presence of V2 [plot (iii')]. Consequently, the\nenhancement of \u03c7(T ) by V1 is much larger than by V2 at\nfinite temperatures. This superiority of V1 is seen only\nat finite temperature. Such an effect of V1 is surprising\nsince V1 was considered to be irrelevant whereas V2 to be\nrelevant.8\nThe origin of this enhancement can be further analyzed\nby considering the following random phase approximation (RPA) for \u03c7(T )\n\u03c7(T ) =\n\n\u03c70p (T )\n2\n,\n\u03c0vF 1 + [G\u03c3 (T ) \u2212 G4\u22a5 (T )] \u03c70p (T )/2\n\n(19)\n\nwhere \u03c70p (T ) = tanh(E0 /4T ) is the magnetic susceptibility of the non-interacting case per branch. In Eq.(19),\nG\u03c3(4\u22a5) (T ) denotes the renormalized coupling at T , i.e.,\nG\u03c3 (T ) = G\u03c3 (0)/[1 + G\u03c3 (0) ln(2T /E0 )] and G4\u22a5 (T ) =\n[G4\u03c1 (l = 0) \u2212 G4\u03c3 (l = 0)]/2. Note that this formula includes the fluctuation beyond the simple RPA due to the\nrenormalization of the Cooper and Peierls channel above\nT . The result of Eq. (19) qualitatively agrees with that\nof Eq. (16) except that it does not consider transients\ndue to the interplay between the Cooper (or Peierls) and\nSB channel for E0 (l) \u223c 4T . At T = 0, Eq. (19) yields\n\u03c7(0) = 2(\u03c0v\u03c3\u2217 )\u22121 where v\u03c3\u2217 is given by\nv\u03c3\u2217 \u2261 vF [1 \u2212 G4\u22a5 /2]\n\u0002\n\u0003\n= vF 1 \u2212 (\u03c0vF )\u22121 (U/2 + V1 + V2 ) .\n\n(20)\n\nAs is clear from this form, \u03c7(T ) depends not only on U\n\n\f4\n\nJ.

Contour plot of \u03c7(T )/\u03c70 at T = 0.001t as a function of V1\nand V2 . The plot at V2 /t = U/2t = 1 corresponds to the phase\nboundary between SDW and CDW.\n\nbut also on V1 and V2 . In earlier studies, \u03c7(0) is given\nmerely by the inverse of v\u03c3 , where the spin velocity v\u03c3 is\nexpressed as v\u03c3 = vF [1 \u2212 U/(2\u03c0vF )] and is independent\nof V1 and V2 .6 The present results reveal that \u03c7(0) is not\ngiven by the ordinary spin-velocity v\u03c3 , but by v\u03c3\u2217 . Such a\ndifference originates from a careful treatment of HI [Eq.\n(4)] (especially the g4 -process) and the accurate derivation of the flow of z\u03c3 [Eq. (17)]. It is worth remarking\nthat in the rotationally invariant Hartree-Fock theory,\nthe V1 interaction does contribute to the magnetic susceptibility. The corrections to the spin velocity obtained\nin this work are consistent with those of the Hartree-Fock\ntheory. We note that a recent result obtained by the numerical diagonalization also indicates the enhancement\nof \u03c7(0) by V1 .10\nFigure 4 shows the contour plot of \u03c7 in the V1 -V2 plane\nat T = 0.001t and U = 2t. It exhibits \u03c7(T ) is monotonically enhanced by increasing V1 . For large V2 , \u03c7(T )\ndecreases exponentially to zero with increasing V2 indicating the formation of CDW state.6, 8 The V1 -V2 dependence of \u03c7(T ) is approximately proportional to V1 + V2\nfor small V2 /t. The magnitude of V2 /t(\u2243 1.3) for vanishing of \u03c7 is larger than that of T = 0, i.e., V2 = U/2(= t),\ndue to the effect of finite temperature.\nThe role of V1 and V2 on \u03c7 can be intuitively understood as follows. First, consider the Hubbard model\n(U > 0, V1 = V2 = 0), where the dominant state is the\n2kF -SDW with a periodicity of four lattice spacing. The\nenhancement of \u03c7(T ) by U (> 0) occurs due to the reduction of double occupancy of up spin and down spin.\nOn the other hand, at low temperatures \u03c7(T ) is reduced\ndue to irrelevance of the backward scattering.6 Next, the\naddition of V1 , which prevents electrons from coming to\nthe nearest-neighbor site, enhances the 2kF -SDW and\nthe local moment of spin. This explains the enhancement of \u03c7(T ) in the presence of V1 as seen from plots (1)\nand (2) in Fig. 3. When V2 is added, electrons become\nless located at next-nearest-neighbor sites leading to the\ncoexistence of 2kF -CDW and 2kF -SDW. The CDW fluctuations reduce \u03c7(T ).\nFinally, the present results can be discussed in connection with the experimental situation for the series of\n\nYuki Fuseya et al.\n\nquasi-one-dimensional organic conductors (TMTCF)2 X\n(C=S, Se; X=PF6, Br).11 In (TMTTF)2 X for example,\n\u03c7(T ) exhibits a maximum and d\u03c7/dT is large at low temperatures. The present results suggest that besides the\neffect of U , a moderate V1 leads to a clear maximum\nin \u03c7(T ) and to large d\u03c7/dT . Considering that a charge\nordered state exists in (TMTTF)2 X,1 these compounds\nshould be characterized by a large V1 . Therefore the previous determinations of U from \u03c7(T ) in (TMTTF)2 X\nmight be considered as overestimations.11, 12 As for the\nBechgaard salts, no charge ordered state is found in\n(TMTSF)2 PF6 and a much less pronounced maximum of\n\u03c7(T ) and smaller d\u03c7/dT are observed. Besides the role of\nU , the present results would indicate that (TMTSF)2 PF6\nhas a relatively large V2 (and not small U and V1 ). A\nlarge V2 is consistent with a 2kF -SDW state coexisting\nwith 2kF -CDW.2, 3\nIn conclusion, we calculated the magnetic susceptibility, \u03c7(T ), by considering the renormalization of the forward scattering in the same branch, the g4 -process, using the Kadanoff-Wilson RG technique. With the careful treatment of the g4 -process, we found that \u03c7(T ) is\nenhanced by the nearest-neighbor interaction V1 , but is\nless enhanced by V2 . It is also found that \u03c7(0) is given by\nv\u03c3\u2217 [Eq. (20)], which is different from the ordinary spinvelocity v\u03c3 . A comparison with the experimental situation of the quasi-one-dimensional organic compounds\nsuggests that (TMTTF)2 X has a large V1 (. U ) but\nsmall V2 , while (TMTSF)2 X has a large V2 (. V1 . U ).\nThe authors thank K. Kuroki, M. Ogata and Y.\nTanaka for valuable discussions.
