Here we\nconsider its quantum deformation Uq (psu(2|2)nR3 ) and derive the fundamental R-matrix. From the latter we deduce an integrable spin chain\nHamiltonian with three independent parameters and the corresponding Bethe equations to describe the spectrum on periodic chains. We\nrelate our Hamiltonian to a two-parametric Hamiltonian proposed by\nAlcaraz and Bariev which can be considered a quantum deformation of\nthe one-dimensional Hubbard model.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction and Overview\n\nFinding the spectrum of a quantum mechanical model is an intricate problem. Indeed, for\ngeneric models there is no complete analytic solution to the spectrum essentially because\nnon-linear interaction terms in the Hamiltonian easily make the problem chaotic and\nintractable. Only very few models, such as the harmonic oscillator, are solvable exactly.\nSomewhere in between these two extremes live the integrable models. They may contain\nhighly non-trivial interactions, but they can nevertheless be solved completely by the\nright ansatz for the wave functions. Such a wave function will depend on a couple\nof parameters, and quantization conditions will impose a system of equations on them.\nThere need not be a general analytic solution to these equations - after all the spectrum\nof integrable models is usually highly non-trivial - nevertheless the reduction to a small\nnumber of parameters is sufficient to make the spectral problem much more tractable\nthan for generic quantum mechanical models.\nTypical integrable models are formulated in 1+1 or 2 dimensions. They include field\ntheories, non-linear sigma models, particle models, vertex models and spin chains (we\nshall focus on the latter in this article). A plethora of integrable models with all kinds of\nfeatures is known to date, and it appears near impossible to make a complete census. A\ncentral insight towards this goal was made in the 1980's by the Leningrad/St. Petersburg\u2013\nSchool who related integrability to the existence of large hidden symmetries. Through\nthe enumeration of suitable symmetry algebras one can hope to classify the integrable\nmodels.\nFor example, a very large class of integrable spin chains can be derived and investigated using Yangians and quantum affine algebras Uq (\u011d) [1]. In particular, the\nHeisenberg XXX (algebraic) spin chain and its relatives with different symmetry algebra\ng and/or different representation are all based on the Yangian double of g. Likewise,\nthe quantum-deformed XXZ-like (trigonometric) spin chain cousins are related to the\nquantum affine algebra Uq (\u011d). XYZ-like (elliptic) spin chains also have a similar but\nmuch more elaborate underlying symmetry algebra.\nA famous integrable spin chain model that has escaped this classification for a long\ntime is the one-dimensional Hubbard model, see [2]. It is a model of electrons propagating\non a chain of nuclei. Each nucleus site can either be unoccupied, singly occupied with\nelectron spin pointing up/down or doubly occupied with opposing electron spins. In\ntotal there are four states per site (c\u2020\u03b1 is a fermionic electron creation operator)\n|\u25e6i,\n\n|\u2191i \u223c c\u20201 |\u25e6i,\n\n|\u2193i \u223c c\u20202 |\u25e6i,\n\n|li \u223c c\u20201 c\u20202 |\u25e6i.\n\n(1.1)\n\nThe middle two states are considered fermionic while the outer two states are overall\nbosonic. This model is exciting because it shows some characteristics of superconductivity, and therefore it is very desirable to understand its foundations well. Integrability\nwas established by Lieb and Wu who also solved the spectrum by means of the Bethe\nansatz [3]. An R-matrix which encodes the integrable structure was later found by Shastry [4]. On the one hand, the R-matrix is the foundation for much of the integrable\nmachinery, such as the algebraic Bethe ansatz [5, 6]. On the other hand, this particular\nR-matrix is rather exceptional because unlike most other known R-matrices it cannot\nbe written as a function of the difference of two spectral parameters. Altogether, the\n1\n\n\falgebraic origin of the R-matrix remained mysterious. It is well-known that it is symmetric under two undeformed su(2) algebras: spin and (twisted) eta-pairing [7] symmetry.\nTherefore one may expect the underlying algebra to be of Yangian (algebraic) rather\nthan of quantum affine (trigonometric) type. Indeed, two su(2) Yangians algebras were\nidentified [8], but they are not sufficient to explain the R-matrix. A fusion procedure of\ntwo XX models was used to derive the R-matrix and explain its features, but it seems\nvery specialized to the model at hand and it hardly illuminates the symmetries.\nNew insight into the algebraic structure came from a very different and unexpected\ndirection: the field of gauge theory, string theory and the so-called AdS/CFT correspondence, which relates certain pairs of gauge and string theories. In that context it was\nobserved that N = 4 superconformal Yang\u2013Mills theory in the 't Hooft limit and its dual,\nIIB string theory on the AdS5 \u00d7S 5 , both display signs of integrability [9], see [10,11] for reviews and further references. The asymptotic coordinate Bethe ansatz [12] for the gauge\ntheory spin chain leads to (two copies of) an interesting scattering matrix [13] which is\nnot of difference form. A construction for strings in light-cone gauge [14] leads to an\nequivalent S-matrix [15]. The scattering particles have four flavors |\u03c61 i, |\u03c62 i, |\u03c8 1 i, |\u03c8 2 i,\nthe former two being bosonic and the latter two being fermionic. The set of particle\nflavors is equivalent to the states of a site in the Hubbard model\n|\u25e6i \u223c |\u03c61 i,\n\n|\u2191i \u223c |\u03c8 1 i,\n\n|\u2193i \u223c |\u03c8 2 i,\n\n|li \u223c |\u03c62 i,\n\n(1.2)\n\nand it was observed that the S-matrix has a structure reminiscent of the R-matrix for\nthe Hubbard model [16]. Indeed, the two matrices can be mapped into each other\nexactly [17] which leads to a very curious connection between string theory and the\nintegrable structure of the Hubbard model. This link is also reflected in the asymptotic\nBethe equations for planar AdS/CFT [18] which contain (two copies) of the Lieb\u2013Wu\nequations in disguise.\nThe large amount of supersymmetry present in the string/gauge theory system, the\nsuperalgebra psu(2, 2|4), thus made its way into the integrable structure of the onedimensional Hubbard model: What remains of this symmetry in the above scattering\npicture is (two copies of) su(2|2) [10]. A crucial point for the further understanding was\nthat the symmetry is centrally extended by gauge transformations inherent to the gauge\ntheory [13] or by residual transformations in the light cone gauge for string theory [19].\nThe symmetry of the S-matrix turns out to be an (exceptional) threefold central extension\nh of the psu(2|2) superalgebra1\nh := psu(2|2) n R3 = su(2|2) n R2 .\n\n(1.3)\n\nThis algebra contains the two well-known bosonic su(2) symmetries of the Hubbard\nmodel which relate the two bosonic and two fermionic states, respectively. However,\nthe additional fermionic generators of the algebra also relate the bosons to the fermions\nand vice versa. In fact the algebra is strong enough to fully constrain the form of the\nR-matrix [13].\nFor simplicity we shall consider the algebra to be complex and do not distinguish between psu(2|2),\npsl(2|2) or psl(2|2, C). Reality conditions refer to the real version psu(2|2) of the algebra.\n1\n\n2\n\n\fThe proper framework for the symmetries of the R-matrix and thus for the integrable\nstructure of the one-dimensional Hubbard model is expected to be a quasi-triangular\nHopf algebra [20]. The goal is then to find the universal R-matrix of which the above\nR-matrix is the fundamental representation. However this requires to first identify the\ncomplete symmetry algebra of the R-matrix. Generically one may expect the algebra\nto be a Yangian double: a deformation of the universal enveloping algebra of the loop\nalgebra of the underlying symmetry h. Indeed many of the Yangian generators have been\nidentified [21, 22]. An investigation of the classical limit [23] of the R-matrix has then\nrevealed the complete classical structure in terms of a quasi-triangular bialgebra [24]\nbased on a curious deformation of the loop algebra u(2|2)[u, u\u22121 ]. This result shows that\nin addition to the central charges, there must also be inner automorphisms.\nAt least two important steps remain to be taken: First, the classical bialgebra needs\nto be quantized to a Yangian double. Second, the universal R-matrix for the Yangian\nneeds to be established which makes the Yangian into a quasi-triangular Hopf algebra.\nHowever, it is not easy to deal with Yangian doubles and their algebraic structure because\nproper quantization of the higher levels is somewhat unintuitive and specialized to the\nalgebra g. Instead one usually considers the corresponding quantum affine algebra Uq (\u011d)\nof which the Yangian is a contraction limit for q \u2192 1. Here one pays the price that the\ng symmetry is quantum deformed and not as manifest as in the Yangian. Instead one\ngains a uniform treatment for the quantum deformation of the Kac\u2013Moody structure of\nthe whole of the affine algebra \u011d. It is the aim of the present paper to lay the foundations\nfor the quantum deformation of the integrable structure of the one-dimensional Hubbard\nmodel. Here we shall start with the quantum deformation Uq (h) of the algebra h and\nleave the full quantum affine algebra Uq (\u0125) (or rather the deformed Uq (u(2|2)[u, u\u22121 ]))\nand its quasi-triangular structure for future work; the corresponding Yangian double\nwould follow as the limit q \u2192 1. We will then derive the fundamental R-matrix which\nshould be understood as the quantum deformation of Shastry's R-matrix for the Hubbard\nmodel. We apply it to derive the Bethe equations for periodic wave functions and a threeparameter family of Hamiltonians with Uq (su(2) \u00d7 su(2)) symmetry which includes the\nHubbard Hamiltonian as a special case.\nIn fact, many attempts have been made to modify and generalize the Hubbard Hamiltonian due to the exceptional properties of the Hubbard model. Widely discussed modifications are the EKS model [25], the supersymmetric U-model [26] and its quantum\ndeformation [27] as well as the su(n) Hubbard models [28] These can all be explained\nwith the available integrability toolkit: The EKS model is a model based on the fundamental representation of u(2|2) and the supersymmetric U-model is based on the\nfour-dimensional representation of su(2|1). These models are somewhat similar to the\nHubbard model, but they do not include it as a special case. The su(n) Hubbard models\nemploy an external coloring of states which preserves integrability. This coloring can be\napplied to any integrable model with conserved charges [29] and it does not alter the\nunderlying symmetry. Further similar models have been discussed in [30]. An important\nclass of models which is also discussed in this context consists of the supersymmetric t-J\nmodel [31] and some of its deformations such as the Bariev model [32] and others [33].\nThe main difference is that these models use a three-dimensional representation on each\n\n3\n\n\fsite and thus the Hilbert space is very different from one of the Hubbard model. The only\nknown true deformation of the Hubbard model appears to be a Hamiltonian composed\nby Alcaraz and Bariev [34]. The Hamiltonian contains substantially more terms and so\nfar it has not been investigated further in the literature. The Bethe equations for this\nmodel were given in [34], and the bear some resemblance with those for the XXZ model.\nThus it is conceivable that the Alcaraz\u2013Bariev model is a quantum-deformation of the\nHubbard model. We shall address the question whether we can recover this Hamiltonian\nat the end of our work.\nThe present paper is organized as follows: We start with a technical part concerning\nthe algebra, R-matrix and Bethe ansatz in Sec. 2,3,4, respectively. In the second part\nconsisting of Sec. 5 we apply the obtained results to a concrete spin chain model. It is\nnot necessary to read the earlier sections (in full detail) to understand the later sections.\nFirst the Uq (h) symmetry is introduced in Sec. 2. We also sketch finite representations\nof the algebra with particular focus on the fundamental representation needed for the\nderivation of the fundamental R-matrix in Sec. 3. We then perform the nested Bethe\nansatz for this R-matrix in Sec. 4 to obtain the Bethe equations for a periodic chain.\nFinally, in Sec. 5 we derive a class of integrable Hamiltonians associated to the R-matrix.\nThese constitute quantum deformations of the Hubbard Hamiltonian. In particular, we\nrecover one of the models proposed by Alcaraz and Bariev. We conclude and give an\noutlook of open problems in Sec. 6.\n\n2\n\nThe Hopf Algebra Uq (su(2|2) n R2)\n\nWe start with the the construction of the symmetry algebra underlying quantum deformations of the one-dimensional Hubbard model. This part is rather technical in nature\nand can be skipped or be used as a reference for the following sections.\n\n2.1\n\nFrom su(2|2) to U(su(2|2) n R2 )\n\nWe start by introducing the universal enveloping algebra U(su(2|2) n R2 ) step by step\nstarting from the Lie superalgebra su(2|2). This will help us to understand and derive\nthe quantum deformation Uq (su(2|2) n R2 ).\nLie Superalgebra.

This algebra has two further possible central extensions P, K.\nThey are generated by Lie brackets of alike supercharges\n{Q\u03b1 b , Q\u03b3 d } = \u03b5\u03b1\u03b3 \u03b5bd P,\n\n{Sa \u03b2 , Sc \u03b4 } = \u03b5ac \u03b5\u03b2\u03b4 K.\n\n(2.3)\n\nThe centrally extended algebra with these charges shall be denoted by\nh := su(2|2) n R2 = psu(2|2) n R3 .\n\n(2.4)\n\nUniversal Enveloping Algebra. The universal enveloping algebra U(h) of h is generated by polynomials of the Lie algebra generators. The Lie brackets are represented\nas commutators or anti-commutators (depending on the statistics of generators)\n[X, Y ] \u2192 XY \u2212 Y X,\n\n{X, Y } \u2192 XY + Y X.\n\n(2.5)\n\nThey respect the Lie algebra relations by identification of certain polynomials, e.g.\nQ\u03b1 b Q\u03b3 d + Q\u03b3 d Q\u03b1 b = \u03b5\u03b1\u03b3 \u03b5bd P.\n\n(2.6)\n\nChevalley Basis. Within the universal enveloping algebra it is not necessary to keep\nall generators of the Lie algebra explicitly. For example, the central charge P can be\nrepresented through a quadratic combination of supercharges, see (2.6). A minimal set\nof generators for this rank-three algebra is given by three Cartan generators Hj , three\nsimple positive roots Ej and three simple negative roots Fj , j = 1, 2, 3. One may identify\nthem with the Lie generators as follows\nH1 = R2 2 \u2212 R1 1 = 2R2 2 ,\nH2 = \u2212C \u2212 21 H1 \u2212 12 H3 ,\nH3 = L2 2 \u2212 L1 1 = 2L2 2 ,\n\nE1 = R2 1 ,\nE2 = Q2 2 ,\nE3 = L1 2 ,\n\nF1 = R1 2 ,\nF2 = S2 2 ,\nF3 = L2 1 .\n\n(2.7)\n\nThis basis corresponds to the distinguished Dynkin diagram of su(2|2) in Fig. 1. The\nsymmetric Cartan matrix in this basis reads\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n+2 \u22121\n0\n0 +1 \uf8f8 .\nAjk = \uf8ed \u22121\n(2.8)\n0 +1 \u22122\n5\n\n\fNote that the algebra su(2|2) has a degenerate Cartan matrix and therefore has a null\nvector which reads vj = (1, 2, 1). It can be used to express the central charge of su(2|2)\n3\n\nC=\u2212\n\n1X\nvj Hj = \u2212 12 H1 \u2212 H2 \u2212 21 H3 .\n2 j=1\n\nThe other two central charges in the Chevalley basis take the form\n\b\n\b\nP = [E1 , E2 ], [E3 , E2 ] ,\nK = [F1 , F2 ], [F3 , F2 ] .\n\n(2.9)\n\n(2.10)\n\nCommutation Relations. Let us now state the commutation relations of the universal enveloping algebra. Commutators with the Cartan generators Hj are given by\n(j, k = 1, 2, 3)\n[Hj , Hk ] = 0,\n\n[Hj , Ek ] = +Ajk Ek ,\n\n[Hj , Fk ] = \u2212Ajk Fk .\n\n(2.11)\n\nThe non-trivial commutators of positive and negative simple roots read\n[E1 , F1 ] = +H1 ,\n\n{E2 , F2 } = \u2212H2 ,\n\n[E3 , F3 ] = \u2212H3 .\n\n(2.12)\n\nNote that we have normalized the generators in a way such that all relations can be\nexpressed using the symmetric Cartan matrix Ajk . For superalgebras this leads to a negative sign in [Ej , Fj ] for one of the two bosonic subalgebras. The remaining commutators\nbetween positive and negative simple roots vanish in this basis\n[Ej , Fk ] = 0 for j 6= k.\n\n(2.13)\n\nFinally, we need to impose the Serre relations between positive and between negative\nsimple roots.\n\u0002\n\u0003 \u0002\n\u0003\n0 = [E1 , E3 ] = E2 E2 = E1 , [E1 , E2 ] = E3 , [E3 , E2 ]\n\u0002\n\u0003 \u0002\n\u0003\n= [F1 , F3 ] = F2 F2 = F1 , [F1 , F2 ] = F3 , [F3 , F2 ] .\n(2.14)\nNote that for superalgebras these standard Serre relations are not sufficient. For the\nalgebra U(su(2|2)) we need two additional Serre relations which effectively read\n0 = P = K.\n\n(2.15)\n\nIt is however consistent to drop them altogether which leads to the centrally extended\nalgebra U(h).\n\n2.2\n\nQuantum Deformation\n\nThe quantum algebra Uq (g) is a deformation of the universal enveloping algebra U(g)\nof some Lie algebra g. It is obtained by inserting various factors and exponents of q\nin various relations. A convenient combination to use in this context is the so-called\nquantum number\nq x \u2212 q \u2212x\n.\n(2.16)\n[x]q :=\nq \u2212 q \u22121\n6\n\n\fThis relation is defined in the same way if x is a generator. There are two ways to achieve\nthis: Either one defines q x = 1 + x log q + 12 x2 log2 q + . . . as a formal power series. For\npractical purposes one would assume that q \u2248 1 and thus log q \u2248 0. Alternatively one\ncan define q x as an element of the Hopf algebra and q \u2212x as its inverse. This is particularly\nuseful if x appears only with integer multiplicity in exponents, q nx = (q x )n , as will be\nthe case here.\nIn the previous section we have seen that the two central charges can be obtained by\ndropping two Serre relations. It is straightforward to apply the same central extension\nfor the quantum deformed algebra Uq (su(2|2)) to obtain Uq (h).\nCommutation Relations. Let us begin with the deformation of the commutation\nrelations of the algebra Uq (su(2|2)). The commutators with Cartan elements do not\nreceive deformations\n[Hj , Hk ] = 0,\n\n[Hj , Ek ] = +Ajk Ek ,\n\n[Hj , Fk ] = \u2212Ajk Fk .\n\n(2.17)\n\nThe Cartan elements usually appear in exponents, and it is convenient to note the\nexponentiated form of these relations\nq Hj Fk = q \u2212Ajk Fk q Hj ,\n\nq Hj Ek = q +Ajk Ek q Hj ,\n\n(2.18)\n\nThe non-trivial commutators of simple roots read in the deformed algebra\n[E1 , F1 ] = [H1 ]q ,\n\n{E2 , F2 } = \u2212[H2 ]q ,\n\n[E3 , F3 ] = \u2212[H3 ]q ,\n\n(2.19)\n\nand the remaining mixed commutators vanish\n[Ej , Fk ] = 0 for j 6= k.\n\n(2.20)\n\nThe Serre relations have the same form as in the undeformed algebra (2.14), but with\nsome additional factors of q due to the quantum-adjoint action. Spelled out they yield\n0 = [E1 , E3 ] = [F1 , F3 ] = E2 E2 = F2 F2\n(2.21)\n\u22121\n\u22121\n= E1 E1 E2 \u2212 (q + q )E1 E2 E1 + E2 E1 E1 = E3 E3 E2 \u2212 (q + q )E3 E2 E3 + E2 E3 E3\n= F1 F1 F2 \u2212 (q + q \u22121 )F1 F2 F1 + F2 F1 F1 = F3 F3 F2 \u2212 (q + q \u22121 )F3 F2 F3 + F2 F3 F3 .\nCentral Elements. The standard central element from the Cartan subalgebra remains\nundeformed\n(2.22)\nC = \u2212 12 H1 \u2212 H2 \u2212 21 H3 .\n\nAs before, the ordinary Serre relations obtained from the Cartan matrix are not sufficient to define Uq (su(2|2)), but we need the constraint P = K = 0 with the quantum\ndeformation of (2.10)\nP = E1 E2 E3 E2 + E2 E3 E2 E1 + E3 E2 E1 E2 + E2 E1 E2 E3 \u2212 (q + q \u22121 )E2 E1 E3 E2 ,\nK = F1 F2 F3 F2 + F2 F3 F2 F1 + F3 F2 F1 F2 + F2 F1 F2 F3 \u2212 (q + q \u22121 )F2 F1 F3 F2 . (2.23)\nIn the centrally extended algebra Uq (h) we will not impose the constraint and thus obtain\ntwo non-trivial central elements P, K. It is straightforward, if tedious, to confirm that\nthese polynomials are indeed central elements of the quantum-deformed algebra.\n7\n\n\f2.3\n\nRepresentations\n\nIt is commonly the case for a finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra g and for generic values\nof q that the representation theory of the quantum deformed algebra Uq (g) is analogous\nto the one of g.3 We have studied some of the simplest finite-dimensional representations\nof Uq (h) and found agreement with this rule. Here we would like to give an overview\nover some basic representations of Uq (h) assuming that there is no qualitative difference\nto the undeformed case.\nOuter Automorphism. Finite representations of h were studied in [17]. The starting\npoint was the representation theory of su(2|2) with fixed eigenvalue C0 of the central\ncharge C, studied in, e.g. [35, 36]. The SL(2) outer automorphism of h then allows to\nrotate the triplet of eigenvalues (C0 , 0, 0) of the central charges (C, P, K) to any desired\ntriplet (C, P, K) with C02 = C 2 \u2212 P K.4 The representation of the psu(2|2) generators\nQ, S is obtained by conjugation with the SL(2) element. Note that the combination\n~C2 = C2 \u2212 PK is invariant under the automorphism.\nIt appears that for the quantum-deformed algebra Uq (h) there also exists a similar outer automorphism. We could use it to relate representations of Uq (h) to those\nof Uq (su(2|2)), see [37], which in turn are analogous to those of su(2|2). We however do not yet understand the automorphism explicitly and therefore the existence of\nthe below representations is an educated guess. The above combination ~C2 should be\nquantum-deformed to some [~C2 ]q . The classification of representations would then use\nthe eigenvalues of this operator. We find that the smallest representations are indeed\ncharacterized by the eigenvalues of the operator\n[~C2 ]q := [C]2q \u2212 PK.\n\n(2.24)\n\nPresumably this combination is invariant under the tentative automorphism.\nLet us consider typical (long) and atypical (short) representations of Uq (h) in analogy\nto the su(2|2) representations studied in [35].\nLong Multiplets. The standard finite-dimensional type of representation shall be\ndenoted by\n{m, n; C, P, K}.\n(2.25)\nIt corresponds to the typical highest-weight representations of su(2|2) with Dynkin labels\n~ 2 ]q )1/2 \u2212 1 n + 1 m. The non-negative integers n, m represent the\n[m; r; n] and r = \u00b1([C\n2\n2\nDynkin labels of the su(2) \u00d7 su(2) subalgebra.\nWe can decompose a Uq (h) multiplet into irreducible multiplets of the subalgebra\nUq (su(2) \u00d7 su(2)). Let the symbol [k] represent the Uq (su(2)) representation with spin\nIn quantum algebras one singles out the case when q is a root of unity because the representation\ntheory is very special at these points.\n4\nFor simplicity we shall consider the algebra h to be complex, and thus there is no distinction between\npositive and negative values of C 2 \u2212 P K.\n3\n\n8\n\n\fk/2; [\u22121] is the empty (zero-dimensional) representation. Then the long multiplet decomposes as follows\n{m, n} \u2192 ([m] \u2297 [1] \u2297 [1], [n]) \u2295 ([m], [n] \u2297 [1] \u2297 [1])\n\u2295 ([m] \u2297 [1], [n] \u2297 [1]) \u2295 ([m] \u2297 [1], [n] \u2297 [1]).\n\n(2.26)\n\nNote the well-known tensor product of Uq (su(2)) representations\nmin(m,n)\n\n[m] \u2297 [n] =\n\nM\nk=0\n\n[m + n \u2212 2k].\n\n(2.27)\n\nThe dimension of a long multiplet is thus 16(m + 1)(n + 1).\nShort Multiplets. A short multiplet shall be labelled by\nhm, n; C, P, Ki.\n\n(2.28)\n\nIt can only exist when the constraint\n~ 2 ]q = [C]2q \u2212 P K = [ 1 (m + n + 1)]2\n[C\nq\n2\n\n(2.29)\n\nholds. The decomposition into irreducible representations of Uq (su(2) \u00d7 su(2)) takes the\nform\nhm, ni \u2192 ([m] \u2297 [1], [n]) \u2295 ([m \u2212 1], [n \u2212 1] \u2297 [1])\n\u2295 ([m], [n] \u2297 [1]) \u2295 ([m \u2212 1] \u2297 [1], [n \u2212 1]).\n\n(2.30)\n\nThis multiplet has dimension 4(m + 1)(n + 1) + 4mn. For example, the four-dimensional\nfundamental representation is the special case m = n = 0 which decomposes into h0, 0i \u2192\n([1], [0]) \u2295 ([0], [1]).\nMultiplet Splitting. The vector space of a long multiplet {m, n; C, P, K} can be\ndecomposed into the vector spaces of two short multiplets\n~ \u2192 hm + 1, n; Ci\n~ \u2295 hm, n + 1; Ci.\n~\n{m, n; C}\n\n(2.31)\n\nHowever, the typical representation of Uq (h) is in general irreducible. A special case is\nwhen the labels and central charges obey the shortening condition\n~ 2 ]q = [ 1 (m + n + 2)]2 ,\n[C\nq\n2\n\n(2.32)\n\nwhich is equivalent to the constraint (2.29) for the short multiplets in (2.31). The long\nrepresentation may then be reduced into the above two short representations. However,\nin general one cannot expect the long representation to be decomposable, it merely has\none short subrepresentation which closes on one of the smaller vector spaces. When\nprojecting out this small vector space one obtains a short factor representation on the\nother small vector space. This fact is perhaps best illustrated by a figure, see Fig. 2.\n9\n\n\fhm + 1, ni\n\nhm, n + 1i\n\nhm + 1, ni\n\n{m, n}\n\nhm, n + 1i\n\nhm + 1, ni\n\n{m, n}\n\nhm, n + 1i\n\nhm + 1, ni\n\n{m, n}\n\nhm, n + 1i\n\n{m, n}\n\nFigure 2: Multiplet Splitting. The long multiplet {m, n} consists of two short multiplets\nhm + 1, ni and hm, n + 1i and a representation of Uq (h) maps between the short multiplets\n(arrows). Generically, the short multiplets are connected in all possible ways (left). When the\nshortening condition holds one (middle) or both (right) arrows between the short multiplets\nare broken. In the second figure from the left, hm + 1, ni is a subrepresentation while hm, n + 1i\nis a factor representation, and the long multiplet is indecomposable. The long multiplet in the\nright figure is fully decomposable.\n\nTensor Products. Let us state some formulas for the decomposition of tensor products\nof long and short representations. It is convenient to introduce some short hand notation\nfor sums of similar representations\n{[k] \u2295 [l], n} := {k, n} \u2295 {l, n},\n\netc..\n\n(2.33)\n\nThe tensor product of two long representations of Uq (h) decomposes as follows\n{m, n} \u2297 {k, l} = {[m] \u2297 [k] \u2297 [1] \u2297 [1], [n] \u2297 [l]}\n\u2295 {[m] \u2297 [k] \u2297 [1], [n] \u2297 [l] \u2297 [1]}\n\u2295 {[m] \u2297 [k] \u2297 [1], [n] \u2297 [l] \u2297 [1]}\n\u2295 {[m] \u2297 [k], [n] \u2297 [l] \u2297 [1] \u2297 [1]}.\n\n(2.34)\n\nFor a tensor product of a long and a short representation the following decomposition\napplies\n{m, n} \u2297 hk, li = {[m] \u2297 [k] \u2297 [1], [n] \u2297 [l]}\n\u2295 {[m] \u2297 [k \u2212 1] \u2297 [1], [n] \u2297 [l \u2212 1]}\n\u2295 {[m] \u2297 [k], [n] \u2297 [l] \u2297 [1]}\n\u2295 {[m] \u2297 [k \u2212 1], [n] \u2297 [l \u2212 1] \u2297 [1]}.\n\n(2.35)\n\nFinally, the tensor product of two short representations reads\nhm, ni \u2297 hk, li = {[m] \u2297 [k], [n] \u2297 [l]}\n\u2295 {[m] \u2297 [k \u2212 1], [n] \u2297 [l \u2212 1]}\n\u2295 {[m \u2212 1] \u2297 [k], [n \u2212 1] \u2297 [l]}\n\u2295 {[m \u2212 1] \u2297 [k \u2212 1], [n \u2212 1] \u2297 [l \u2212 1]}.\n\n(2.36)\n\nThese formulas agree with the decompositions (2.26,2.30).\n\n2.4\n\nHopf Algebra\n\nHere we will complete the Hopf algebra structure of our quantum deformed algebra. We\nfirst define the coproduct and then state the unit, counit and antipode.\n10\n\n\fCoproduct. We shall use the standard coproduct for the generators of Uq (su(2|2))\n\u2206(1) = 1 \u2297 1,\n\u2206(Hj ) = Hj \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 Hj ,\n\u2206(Ej ) = Ej \u2297 1 + q \u2212Hj \u2297 Ej ,\n\u2206(Fj ) = Fj \u2297 q Hj + 1 \u2297 Fj ,\n\n(2.37)\n\nwhere 1 denotes the unit element of the Hopf algebra. Note that the relations are fully\ncompatible with the Serre relations and commutators. The coproducts for the central\ncharges follow by substituting their expressions in terms of the above generators\n\u2206(C) = C \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 C,\n\u2206(P) = P \u2297 1 + q 2C \u2297 P,\n\u2206(K) = K \u2297 q \u22122C + 1 \u2297 K.\n\n(2.38)\n\nNote that the coproduct for the generators P, K turns out to be proportional to the\ngenerators themselves as expected. This fact is related to the the role of P = K = 0 as\nSerre relations of Uq (su(2|2)). The coproduct of such consistent identifications has to be\nproportional to these or other identifications.\nUnit, Counit and Antipode. The unit element of the Hopf algebra is denoted by\n\u03b7(1) = 1. The counit \u03b5 : Uq (h) \u2192 C takes the usual form\n\u03b5(1) = 1,\n\n\u03b5(Hj ) = \u03b5(Ej ) = \u03b5(Fj ) = 0.\n\n(2.39)\n\nFinally, the antipode S : Uq (h) \u2192 Uq (h) is uniquely fixed by the compatibility condition\n\u03bc \u25e6 (S \u2297 1) \u25e6 \u2206(J) = \u03bc \u25e6 (1 \u2297 S) \u25e6 \u2206(J) = \u03b7 \u25e6 \u03b5(J),\n\n(2.40)\n\nfor all J \u2208 Uq (h), where \u03b7 : C \u2192 Uq (h) denotes the unit and \u03bc : Uq (h) \u2297 Uq (h) \u2192 Uq (h)\ndenotes the product. One gets\nS(1) = 1,\n\nS(Fj ) = \u2212Fj q \u2212Hj ,\n\nS(Ej ) = \u2212q Hj Ej ,\n\nS(Hj ) = \u2212Hj ,\n\n(2.41)\n\nand similarly for the central charges\nS(C) = \u2212C,\n\nS(P) = \u2212q \u22122C P,\n\nS(K) = \u2212q 2C K.\n\n(2.42)\n\nHermitian Conjugation. So far we have for simplicity assumed a complex algebra.\nTo restrict to a real algebra we must identify the generators with their conjugates. The\nproper hermiticity relations compatible with the coproduct are\nH\u2020j = Hj ,\n\nE\u2020j = q \u2212Hj Fj .\n\n(2.43)\n\nThis implies the following relations for the central charges\nC\u2020 = C,\n\nP\u2020 = q 2C K.\n\nTo have a hermitian coproduct we furthermore have to constrain q to be real.\n11\n\n(2.44)\n\n\fBraiding. Just as for the undeformed algebra U(h) we shall deform the coproduct\nslightly and according to a Z-grading of the algebra. This grading associates the charges\n+2, +1, \u22121, \u22122 to the generators P, E2 , F2 , K, respectively; the other generators are uncharged. This braiding will later lead to a very non-trivial R-matrix.\nFor the braiding we introduce a new abelian generator U and deform the coproduct\n(2.37) as follows\n\u2206(E2 ) = E2 \u2297 1 + q \u2212H2 U \u2297 E2 ,\n\u2206(F2 ) = F2 \u2297 q H2 + U\u22121 \u2297 F2 ,\n\u2206(P) = P \u2297 1 + q 2C U2 \u2297 P,\n\u2206(K) = K \u2297 q \u22122C + U\u22122 \u2297 K,\n\u2206(U) = U \u2297 U.\n\n(2.45)\n\nThe coproduct of the other elements remains undeformed. This deformation of the\ncoproduct is consistent with the algebra because the exponents of U follow the Z-grading\nof the algebra. The counit for U should be defined as \u03b5(U) = 1. The antipode must then\nobey the relation (2.40) which leads to the following modifications of (2.41)\nS(E2 ) = \u2212q H2 U\u22121 E2 ,\n\nS(F2 ) = \u2212q \u2212H2 UF2 ,\n\nS(U) = U\u22121\n\n(2.46)\n\nand for the central charges\nS(C) = \u2212C,\n\nS(P) = \u2212q \u22122C U\u22122 P,\n\nS(K) = \u2212q 2C U2 K.\n\n(2.47)\n\nThe hermitian conjugation remains untouched by the braiding and\nU\u2020 = U\u22121 .\n\n(2.48)\n\nCocommutativity of the Center. A Hopf algebra is called quasi-cocommutative\nif the coproduct \u2206(J) and the opposite coproduct \u2206op (J) := P(\u2206(J)) are related by\nconjugation. Here P defines the graded permutation operator for the tensor product. The\nconjugation is specified by an R-matrix R \u2208 Uq (h)\u2297Uq (h) satisfying the cocommutativity\ncondition\n\u2206op (J)R = R\u2206(J).\n(2.49)\nFor generators J from the center of Uq (h) this relation implies that the coproduct\nmust cocommute \u2206op (J) = \u2206(J). With our coproduct this is obvious for the central\ncharge C\n\u2206(C) = C \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 C = \u2206op (C).\n(2.50)\nThe other two central charges P and K however do not enjoy this property\n\u2206(P) = P \u2297 1 + q 2C U2 \u2297 P,\n\u2206(K) = K \u2297 q \u22122C + U\u22122 \u2297 K,\n\nbut\n\n\u2206op (P) = P \u2297 U2 q 2C + 1 \u2297 P,\n\u2206op (K) = K \u2297 U\u22122 + q \u22122C \u2297 K.\n\n(2.51)\n\nBy taking the difference of the coproducts one can see that the central charges P, K have\nto be identified with C and U as follows\nP = g\u03b1(1 \u2212 q 2C U2 ),\n\nK = g\u03b1\u22121 (q \u22122C \u2212 U\u22122 ).\n12\n\n(2.52)\n\n\fHere g and \u03b1 are two global constants of the reduced algebra.\nAn alternative derivation of the braiding and identifications based on a consistent\nfactorised scattering picture is presented in App. B.\n\n2.5\n\nFundamental Representation\n\nThe fundamental representation is the short multiplet\nhC, P, Ki = h0, 0; C, P, Ki.\n\n(2.53)\n\nThe vector space is spanned by four states\n|\u03c61 i, |\u03c62 i, |\u03c8 1 i, |\u03c8 2 i,\n\n(2.54)\n\nwhere |\u03c6a i are bosonic and |\u03c8 \u03b1 i are fermionic.

It is not too hard to see that the closure of the algebra of supercharges\nleads to the constraints\nad = [C + 21 ]q ,\n\nbc = [C \u2212 21 ]q ,\n\nab = P,\n\ncd = K.\n\n(2.56)\n\nThis is in agreement with the constraint (2.29) which is required for the fundamental\nrepresentation\n~ 2 ]q = [ 1 ]2q .\n(2.57)\n[C\n2\nIt furthermore follows that the constraint ad \u2212 bc = 1 for q = 1 is deformed to\n(ad \u2212 qbc)(ad \u2212 q \u22121 bc) = 1.\n\n(2.58)\n\nNote that there is a subtlety in taking the limit q \u2192 1 in the above constraint (2.58):\nIt leads to two inequivalent constraints ad \u2212 bc = \u00b11 which correspond to different\nembeddings of the Lie algebra into the Chevalley basis. The plus sign yields the above\nconstraint with the identifications in (2.7) or equivalently E2 = \u2212Q2 2 , F2 = \u2212S2 2 . The\nminus sign corresponds to one of the following embeddings\nE2 = \u2213Q2 2 ,\n\nF2 = \u00b1S2 2 ,\n\n13\n\nH2 = C + 21 H1 + 12 H3 .\n\n(2.59)\n\n\fx\u00b1 Parameters.

The parameter \u03b3 adjusts the normalization of fermions |\u03c8 \u03b1 i\nwith respect to bosons |\u03c6a i. Furthermore the parameter \u03b1 adjusts the normalization of\nE2 , P vs. F2 , K. A particularly useful choice for \u03b3 will turn out to be\np\n\u2212i\u03b1q C+1/2 U (x+ \u2212 x\u2212 )\np\n\u03b3=\n.\n(2.65)\n4\n1 \u2212 (q \u2212 q \u22121 )2 g 2\nApart from the features discussed below, we expect it to have nice analytic properties\nanalogous to the case of the undeformed case discussed in [38].

For a fixed parameter g the constraint (2.61) defines a complex torus\nwith modulus\np\n(2.66)\nk = 4ig 1 \u2212 g 2 (q \u2212 q \u22121 )2 .\nThe quotient of the parameters x\u00b1 can be expressed conveniently through the point z\non a doubly-periodic complex plane using\nx+\ncn(z) + ir sn(z)\n,\n=\n\u2212\nqx\ncn(z) \u2212 ir sn(z)\nwhere the constant r is given by\ns\nr=\n\n1 + 16g 2 \u2212 16g 4 (q \u2212 q \u22121 )2\n.\n1 + 4g 2 (q 1/2 + q \u22121/2 )2\n\n(2.67)\n\n(2.68)\n\nThe individual parameters x\u00b1 are then written as rational functions of sn(z), cn(z), dn(z),\nbut we shall refrain from stating these functions explicitly here.\nTransposition. The antipode map corresponds to transposing the representation matrices\nS(J) ' C \u22121 J\u0304ST C,\n(2.69)\n(|j|+1)|k|\nwhere the supertransposition is defined by AST\nAkj and C is the charge\njk := (\u22121)\nconjugation matrix\n\nC|\u03c61 i = \u2212q +1/2 |\u03c62 i,\nC|\u03c62 i = +q \u22121/2 |\u03c61 i,\n\nC|\u03c8 1 i = \u2212q +1/2 |\u03c8 2 i,\nC|\u03c8 2 i = +q \u22121/2 |\u03c8 1 i.\n\n(2.70)\n\nThe conjugation matrix was constructed such that the equation is satisfied for the bosonic\nChevalley-Serre generators E1 , E3 , F1 , F3 . By solving this equation for the fermionic\ngenerators E2 , F2 , we obtain the antipode representation parameters \u0101, b\u0304, c\u0304, d \u0304 in terms of\nthe original parameters a, b, c, d (see also [15])\n\u0101 = \u2212U \u22121 q \u2212C+1/2 b,\nb\u0304 = U \u22121 q \u2212C\u22121/2 a,\nc\u0304 = \u2212U q C+1/2 d,\nd \u0304 = U q C\u22121/2 c.\n\n(2.71)\n\nWe can solve these equations for the crossed spectral parameters and get5\n+\n\n+\n\nx\u0304 = s(x ),\n\n\u2212\n\nq 1/2 \u03b1 C\n\u03b3\u0304 =\n(q U \u2212 q \u2212C U \u22121 ).\n\u03b3\n\n\u2212\n\nx\u0304 = s(x ),\n\n(2.72)\n\nNote that \u03b3\u0304 is compatible with the choice (2.65) of \u03b3 as a function of x\u00b1 . The antipode\nmap s(x) for the parameters x\u00b1 is defined as\nig \u22121 + (q \u2212 q \u22121 )x\ns(x) = \u22121\n.\nig x \u2212 (q \u2212 q \u22121 )\n\n(2.73)\n\nNote that \u03b3\u0304 \u0304 = \u2212\u03b3 which is consistent with the Z4 -periodicity of supertransposition. Alternatively\none could define \u016a = \u22121/U leading to \u03b3\u0304 \u0304 = \u03b3.\n5\n\n15\n\n\fThis map x\u00b1 7\u2192 s(x\u00b1 ) acts on the braiding factor and the central charge as follows\nC\u0304 = \u2212C,\n\n\u016a =\n\n1\n.\nU\n\n(2.74)\n\nHermiticity. Let us introduce the canonical scalar product for our states\nh\u03c8\u03b1 | \u03c8 \u03b2 i = \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 .\n\nh\u03c6a | \u03c6b i = \u03b4ab ,\n\n(2.75)\n\nThe representation is hermitian if the conditions in (2.43) hold. They imply the relations\na\u2217 = q C+1/2 d and b\u2217 = q C\u22121/2 c. Expressed in terms of x\u00b1 -parameters they correspond to\n(x+ )\u2217 =\n\n1\n,\ns(x\u2212 )\n\n(x\u2212 )\u2217 =\n\n1\n.\ns(x+ )\n\n(2.76)\n\nThis is equivalent to the condition that the uniformized parameter z on the complex\ntorus is real. Furthermore the moduli of the parameters \u03b3 and \u03b1 are constrained\n|\u03b3|2 = \u2212ix+ + iq 2C+1 x\u2212 ,\n\n|\u03b1|2 = 1.\n\n(2.77)\n\nAgain, the first constraint is automatically satisfied when \u03b3 is given by (2.65) as a function\nof x\u00b1 .\n\n3\n\nThe Fundamental R-Matrix\n\nTo determine the full universal R-matrix is a formidable task. Here we will satisfy\nourselves with the lesser task of finding the representation of the R-matrix on two fundamentals.\n\n3.1\n\nMatrix Structure\n\nWe construct the fundamental R-matrix by demanding that it satisfies the cocommutativity relation (2.49)\n\u2206op (J)R = R\u2206(J).\n(3.1)\nThe most general ansatz which satisfies the relation for the Uq (su(2) \u00d7 su(2)) subalgebra,\ni.e. for E1 , E3 , F1 , F3 , is given in Tab. 1. The ten functions A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, K, L\n0\nare a priori free. They are however fully constrained up to one overall phase factor R12\nby cocommutativity w.r.t. the supersymmetry generators E2 , F2 . This finding is related\nto the irreducibility of the tensor product of two fundamental representations (2.36)\nh0, 0i \u2297 h0, 0i = {0, 0}.\n\n(3.2)\n\nWe present our findings for the ten functions in Tab. 2. This derivation parallels completely the case of the undeformed algebra in [17] and for q = 1 the results agree.

In a\nquasi-triangular Hopf algebra this also applies to singlet states which are composed from\nnon-singlets (fusion).

In\nparticular, it is required to write down quantization conditions for eigenstates of finite\nclosed or open spin chains. However, as the R-matrix is a matrix, the resulting equations\nwould be matrix equations and rather hard to handle. Instead of dealing with matrix\nequations we can first \"diagonalize\" the R-matrix by introducing a suitable vacuum state\nand excitations. This is done by means of the nested coordinate Bethe ansatz [42], and\nthe procedure follows along the lines of [17] for the undeformed setup. Alternatively, one\nmay perform a nested algebraic Bethe ansatz similar to the one in [5, 43] which should\nlead to the same set of Bethe equations.\n\n4.1\n\nVacuum and Propagation\n\nWe would like to find suitable eigenstates of a chain of K fundamental representations\nII\nwith labels x\u00b1\nk , k = 1, . . . , K. We define the level-II vacuum state |0i to consist only\nof \u03c61 's. The top-level R-matrix RI\u03c0 is a product of pairwise R-matrices RIk,j = Rk,j\nrepresenting a permutation \u03c0 \u2208 SK of the K sites. It multiplies the vacuum state by a\nphase factor\nRI\u03c0 |0iII = R\u03c0I |0iII .\n(4.1)\nThe total phase factor is a product over pairwise phase factors\nR\u03c0I\n\n=\n\nY\n(k,j)\u2208\u03c0\n\nI,I\n\nR (xk , xj ),\n\n+\n\u2212\nq Ck Uk xj \u2212 xk\nR (xk , xj ) = A(xk , xj ) = R (xk , xj ) Cj\n+ .\nq Uj x\u2212\nj \u2212 xk\nI,I\n\n0\n\n(4.2)\n\nThe level-II vacuum has two flavors of elementary excitations.

Furthermore f (y, xk ) could be multiplied\nby any function of y.\n\n4.2\n\nScattering\n\nWe now have to solve the analog of the compatibility condition (4.5) for a two-excitation\nstate. We make the following ansatz\n|\u03c8 \u03b1 \u03c8 \u03b2 iII\n\u03c0 =\n\nK\nX\nk<j=1\n\n\u03c0(k)\n\u2193\n\u03b1\n\n\u03c0(j)\n\u2193\n\u03b2\n\n\u03a8\u03c0,k (y1 )\u03a8\u03c0,j (y2 )|\u03c61 . . . \u03c8 . . . \u03c8 . . . \u03c61 iI\n\n(4.7)\n\nwhich solves the compatibility condition except when the two excitations are neighbors.\nThis state can mix with a state where one spin \u03c61 is replaced by \u03c62\n|\u03c62 iII\n\u03c0\n\n=\n\nK\nX\nk=1\n\n\u03c0(k)\n\u2193\n2\n\n\u03a8\u03c0,k (y1 )\u03a8\u03c0,k (y2 )f (y1 , y2 , x\u03c0(k) )|\u03c61 . . . \u03c6 . . . \u03c61 iI .\n\n(4.8)\n\nThe spin \u03c62 should be interpreted as the overlap of two fermionic excitations.

Generically\nfor a nested Bethe ansatz with two levels they can be written as follows\n1=\n\nK\nY\n\nR\n\nI,II\n\n(xj , yk )\n\nj=1\n\n1=\n\nK\nY\n\nN\nY\n\nR\n\nII,II\n\n(yj , yk )\n\nM\nY\n\nj=1\nj6=k\n\nR\n\nI,III\n\n(xj , wk )\n\nj=1\n\nN\nY\n\nRIII,II (wj , yk ),\n\nj=1\n\nR\n\nII,III\n\n(yj , wk )\n\nj=1\n\nM\nY\n\nRIII,III (wj , yk ),\n\n(4.16)\n\nj=1\nj6=k\n\nThus for the system in question they take the form\n1=\n\nK\nY\n\nq\n\n\u2212Cj \u22121/2\n\nj=1\n\n1=\n\nyk\nUj\u22121\nyk\n\nM\ni \u22121\nY\n\u2212 x+\nj\n\u22121 qu(yk ) \u2212 wj + 2 g\nq\n,\n\u2212 x\u2212\nq \u22121 u(yk ) \u2212 wj \u2212 2i g \u22121\nj j=1\n\nM\nN\nY\nwk \u2212 q \u22121 u(yj ) + 2i g \u22121 Y q \u22121 wk \u2212 qwj \u2212 2i (q + q \u22121 )g \u22121\n.\nq\ni \u22121\n\u22121 w + i (q + q \u22121 )g \u22121\nw\n\u2212\nqu(y\n)\n\u2212\ng\nqw\n\u2212\nq\nk\nj\nk\nj\n2\n2\nj=1\nj=1\n\n(4.17)\n\nj6=k\n\n4.5\n\nDualization\n\nAt the very beginning of the nested Bethe ansatz one can in fact choose between two\ndifferent vacua, composed from only bosons \u03c61 's as above (alternatively \u03c62 's) or composed\nfrom only fermions \u03c8 1 's (alternatively \u03c8 2 's). In both cases the NBA will proceed in a\nvery similar fashion, but lead to two different but equivalent sets of Bethe equations.\nInstead of performing the alternative NBA, we shall derive the alternative Bethe\nequations by means of dualization. The dualization of our Bethe equations for the\nundeformed case was performed in [18] (which is equivalent to the dualization of the\nLieb\u2013Wu equations [3] in [44]). Here the procedure is qualitatively the same, but requires\nspecial care due to various insertions of q. Let us outline it in the following:\nThe first Bethe equation in (4.17) can be viewed as an algebraic equation P (yk ) = 0\nwith the polynomial\nP (y) =\n\nK\nY\n\nq\n\nCj +1/2\n\nj=1\n\n\u2212\n\nK\nY\nj=1\n\nUj y \u2212\n\ny \u2212 x+\nj\n\nM\n\u0001Y\nj=1\n\nx\u2212\nj\n\nM\n\u0001Y\nj=1\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\nq ig \u22121 y \u2212 (q \u2212 q \u22121 ) q \u22121 u(y) \u2212 wj \u2212 2i g \u22121\n\nig \u22121 y \u2212 (q \u2212 q \u22121 )\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\nqu(y) \u2212 wj + 2i g \u22121 .\n\n(4.18)\n\nNote that the common factor (ig \u22121 y \u2212 (q \u2212 q \u22121 )) was introduced in order to cancel the\ndenominator of s(y) in u(y). This polynomial has degree K + 2M , i.e. N of its roots\n25\n\n\fare the yk and the remaining \u00d1 = K + 2M \u2212 N roots will be denoted by \u1ef9k .

Indeed a0 is an overall multiplier of the operator, a2\nis an overall shift and a1 , a3 correspond to a shift of the energy eigenvalues proportional\nto the H1 , H3 Cartan generator eigenvalues. The terms multiplied by bk vanish after\nsummation over the whole spin chain with periodic boundary conditions (5.1).\nThe similarity transformation induced by T is the following Reshetikhin twist [45] of\nthe integrable structure\n\u22060 (J) = T \u2206(J)T \u22121 ,\n\nR0 = P(T )RT \u22121 .\n\n(5.13)\n\nUsually in quantum-deformed spin chains the case of q on the unit circle also leads to hermitian\nHamiltonians.

The Bethe equations derived by Alcaraz and\nBariev are almost the same for the A\u00b1 and B\u00b1 cases. Actually, the only difference is the\ndefinition of a global parameter r as a function of \u03b7, namely\ncosh 2r = \u000f sin2 \u03b8 + cos2 \u03b8 cosh 2\u03b7\n\nvs.\n\ncosh 2r = cosh 2\u03b7\n\n(5.78)\n\nfor cases A and B, respectively. This implies that set of solutions to the Bethe equations\nfor model A with \u03b7 = \u03b7A is the same as the set of solutions for model B with \u03b7 = \u03b7B\nwhere \u03b7A and \u03b7B are related by\n\u000f sin2 \u03b8 + cos2 \u03b8 cosh 2\u03b7A = cosh 2\u03b7B\n\n(5.79)\n\nMoreover the dispersion relation is the same for both cases, and therefore the spectra\nof the models agree. Note that our reparametrization (5.48,5.49) of \u03b7 has been chosen\ncarefully so that the above relation holds for equal \u03be = \u03beA = \u03beB .\nIn fact this leads to a puzzle concerning our above results: We have not been able to\nfind a transformation of the Hamiltonian for model A that restores manifest Uq (su(2) \u00d7\nsu(2)) symmetry. Therefore we have not been able to relate this Hamiltonian to ours.\nNevertheless the matching of spectra implies that the two Hamiltonians are indeed related\nby a similarity transformation for a suitable choice of parameters. Consequently, there\nmust exist a more elaborate transformation to make the Uq (su(2) \u00d7 su(2)) symmetry of\nthe Hamiltonian of model A manifest and match it with our Hamiltonian.\nComparison of Scattering Matrices. To shed more light onto the equivalence of\nthe A\u00b1 and B\u00b1 cases we shall compare the corresponding scattering matrices. These\nwere derived in [34] for excitations c\u20201 and c\u20202 with momentum p = \u2212i log z above the\n(ferromagnetic) vacuum and they can be compared to the results of Sec. 4.2. We will use\nthe parametrization (5.48,5.49) which allows us to compare the expressions directly without the further need to transform parameters. It turns out that the diagonal scattering\nmatrix elements precisely match\n21\n12\n21\n(SA )12\n12 (z1 , z2 ) = (SA )21 (z1 , z2 ) = (SB )12 (z1 , z2 ) = (SB )21 (z1 , z2 ).\n\n(5.80)\n\nThe off-diagonal elements also agree up to a simple factor\n12\n(SA )12\n21 (z1 , z2 ) = (SB )21 (z1 , z2 )\n\nf (z1 )\n,\nf (z2 )\n\nwith\nf (z) =\n\n21\n(SA )21\n12 (z1 , z2 ) = (SB )12 (z1 , z2 )\n\n1 + \u000f\u03bez\n.\nz + \u000f\u03be\n\nf (z2 )\n. (5.81)\nf (z1 )\n(5.82)\n\nThe fact that the off-diagonal elements differ by reciprocal factors of f (z1 )/f (z2 )\nalone implies that the spectra are the same. Therefore there must exist a similarity\ntransformation between the two Hamiltonians. In fact the transformation is simple for\nscattering states: Each excitation c\u20202 with momentum p is multiplied by a factor of f (eip )\nwhile the other excitations c\u20201 are left alone. It is not hard to convince oneself that this\nleads to the above relative factors between the S-matrix elements. However, it is not as\n43\n\n\fstraightforward to express the similarity transformation for spin chain states because the\nthe transformation must be non-local due to the momentum dependence of the factors\nf (eip ). Astonishingly the Hamiltonian remains local after the similarity transformation\nwhich implies that the transformation must be of a very special kind.\nAn Alternative Coalgebra? The above discussion has made it clear that the A\u00b1\nand B\u00b1 Hamiltonians are equivalent. Consequently the A\u00b1 Hamiltonian must obey a\nUq (su(2) \u00d7 su(2)) symmetry albeit in a non-standard form. It is conceivable that this\nsymmetry is generated by an alternative coproduct Uq (h). This is in fact a promising idea\nbecause it would explain the locality of the A\u00b1 Hamiltonian: Assuming that there exist\nan alternative (fundamental) R-matrix, we could right away derive a nearest neighbor\nHamiltonian which is likely to be the one of the A\u00b1 cases. Thus it would be exciting\nto find an alternative coalgebra structure for Uq (h) and also find a suitable similarity\ntransformation to the canonical one derived in this paper. Unfortunately this issue is\noutside the scope of the present paper.\n\n5.6\n\nQuantum-Deformed EKS Model\n\nAt the (x+ , x\u2212 ) values (0, 0), (\u221e, \u221e) as well as (s(0), s(0)), (s(\u221e), s(\u221e)) one obtains\nthe quantum-deformation of the EKS model [25]. For instance at (x+ , x\u2212 ) = (0, 0) the\n0\nparameters of the rescaled Hamiltonian Hj,k\n= (q 1/2 /G)Hj,k read\nA0 = \u2212B 0 = \u2212D0 = E 0 = 12 (q + q \u22121 ),\n\nG = L\u22121 = q 1/2 ,\n\nC 0 = F 0 = H 0 = K 0 = 0.\n(5.83)\nIt is not too hard to see that after a twist this leads to the quantum-deformed EKS\nmodel, i.e. an standard integrable nearest-neighbor spin chain with Uq (u(2|2)) symmetry\nand spins in the four-dimensional fundamental representation.\nNote that this model is somewhat singular. For instance the Bethe equations (5.16)\ndo not apply directly, but the limit (x+ , x\u2212 ) \u2192 (0, 0) has to be taken carefully. In\nparticular, there are two allowed limits of the yk , either yk \u2192 0 or yk \u2192 s(0). Let N1 of\nthem be of the first kind and N3 = N \u2212 N1 of the second. They should scale like\n\u0001\n(1)\n(3)\nyk \u223c exp(2\u03bbk )qx\u2212 ,\nyk+N1 \u223c s exp(2\u03bbk )qx\u2212 .\n(5.84)\nFurthermore, the wk must scale like\n(2)\n\ni q + q \u22121 exp(2\u03bbk )qx\u2212\n+ 2\n.\nwk \u223c \u2212\n2g q \u2212 q \u22121\ng (q \u2212 q \u22121 )2\n\n(5.85)\n\nThe limit of the Bethe equations (5.16) agrees with the standard form of Uq (u(2|2))\n\n44\n\n\fBethe equations, cf.

In the limit q \u2192 1 they obviously approach the values (0, \u221e) and\n(\u221e, 0) corresponding to the Hubbard model. One has to be careful in using these values\nbecause several common combinations of x\u00b1 turn out to be singular and have to be\nregularized properly, e.g. by taking a limit.\nFor definiteness we shall use the pair\n(x+ , x\u2212 ) = (0, s(0));\n\n(5.88)\n\nthe other combinations yield similar results.

This fact is related to our choice of\nx\u00b1 . E.g. choosing x\u00b1 such that the dispersion relation is isotropic leads to the Alcaraz\u2013\nBariev model discussed in Sec. 5.5. It may be desirable to investigate this model further\nto see if it has interesting (physical) properties.\n\n6\n\nConclusions and Outlook\n\nIn this paper we have considered quantum deformations of the threefold central extension\nh = psu(2|2)nR3 of the Lie superalgebra psu(2|2). We have set up the Hopf algebra Uq (h)\ntogether with its fundamental R-matrix and applied it to derive quantum deformations\nof the one-dimensional Hubbard model.\nA first important result is that the quantum deformation Uq (h) of the Lie superalgebra\nh is possible despite its non-standard structure (central extension). Moreover, we have\nconstructed an invariant fundamental R-matrix which obeys the Yang-Baxter equation,\ncrossing symmetry and fusion (with a suitable choice of overall phase factor). This\nsuggests that the Hopf algebra can be made quasi-cocommutative and quasi-triangular.\nCuriously, the matrix structure of the fundamental R-matrix is determined by Uq (h)\ninvariance alone. This feature is related to the representation theory Uq (h) which we\nhave outlined and which is largely analogous to the undeformed superalgebras h and\n46\n\n\fsu(2|2). We have also discussed hermiticity conditions and we were forced to choose q to\nbe real. Usually in quantum groups Uq (g) one can also choose q from the unit circle (such\nthat q + q \u22121 is real), and it would be important to understand if and how hermiticity\ncan be achieved in that case for our algebra.\nWe have applied the nested Bethe ansatz to the R-matrix in order to diagonalize it\nand to write down the Bethe equations for a closed spin chain. The Bethe equations are\nstructurally similar to the Lieb\u2013Wu equations for the one-dimensional Hubbard model:\nOne should view the former as the quantum deformation of the latter; the Lieb-Wu\nequations are of the algebraic (XXX-like) type, while ours are trigonometric (XXZlike). A question for future work is whether an elliptic (XYZ-like) deformation of our\nfundamental R-matrix and the Lieb\u2013Wu equations exists.\nIn the final section we have derived an integrable Hamiltonian from the R-matrix\nand compared directly it to the one-dimensional Hubbard model and some of its generalizations. Our Hamiltonian has manifest Uq (su(2) \u00d7 su(2)) symmetry, three independent parameters and it can be further deformed in several canonical ways (rescaling,\nshifts, twists) while preserving integrability. By adjusting the parameters we were able\nto match the one-parametric Hubbard chain as well the cases B\u00b1 of a two-parametric\nHamiltonian proposed by Alcaraz and Bariev [34]. We have also identified a potentially\ninteresting combination of parameters for which our Hamiltonian has no pair-hopping\nterms. We have not managed to explain the cases A\u00b1 of the Alcaraz\u2013Bariev Hamiltonian in general, but we have provided an argument based on the Bethe equations why\nthis should be possible nevertheless. It would therefore be important to show explicitly\nhow to relate the cases A\u00b1 , perhaps by finding an alternative coalgebra for Uq (h(2)).\nFurthermore an investigation of the possible condensed matter theory applications of\nquantum-deformations of the one-dimensional Hubbard model is worth performing. Do\nthese models also display signs of superconductivity like the undeformed model? It is\nalso worth finding out if any of the other electronic models discussed in the introduction\ncan be obtained from our Hamiltonian.\nHere we have investigated the Hopf algebra Uq (h), but the analysis is far from complete. In fact, the symmetry algebra in the undeformed setup is much larger, it appears\nto be a Yangian (double) [21]. The corresponding quantum deformation would be a\nquantum affine algebra. One will need this algebra in order to formulate the universal\nR-matrix of which the R-matrix derived in this paper is the fundamental representation.\nA classical and undeformed analysis [24] has shown that the affine algebra is not just\nh[u, u\u22121 ]. It is rather a deformation of u(2|2)[u, u\u22121 ] which includes only one tower of\ncentral charges and one tower of inner automorphisms. Therefore it is quite clear that\nthis quantum affine algebra is not Kac\u2013Moody, and one cannot directly apply the general\nframework associated with such algebras.\nFinally, we should ask how our results can be applied to the AdS/CFT correspondence. Quantum-deformed (XXZ-like) spin chains with Uq (su(2)) and Uq (su(3)) symmetry have indeed appeared in this context, in particular for so-called beta-deformed\nN = 4 gauge theory [47] with complex deformation parameter [48\u201350]. However, the\nargument used in [49] tells us that the symmetry considered in this paper cannot apply\nto conformal gauge theories such as [47]: The two bosonic subalgebras su(2) of psu(2|2)\nplay different roles; one originates from the internal symmetry which is deformed, and\n47\n\n\fthe other one originates from conformal symmetry which remains undeformed. In contrast, quantum deformations typically apply to the whole of a Hopf algebra, as is the\ncase for our algebra. Nevertheless, it seems possible to deform the internal su(4) symmetry and the associated S 5 , so why should it not be possible to deform su(2, 2) and\nthe associated AdS5 ? Let us speculate about such a complete quantum deformation\nof the AdS/CFT correspondence: an \"AdSq /CFTq \" duality. The field theory would\nhave to have quantum-deformed conformal and internal symmetries, and it would most\nprobably be formulated on some sort of non-commutative spacetime. The string theory\nwould be formulated on a quantum-deformed (AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 )q background, which would\nbe both curved and non-commutative. Perhaps the most convenient definition would be\nin terms of coset spaces like SOq (6)/SOq (5) with non-commutative coordinates. Despite\nthe expected dire technical complications, the planar limit of these dual models would\nstand a good chance of being integrable, and the world sheet S-matrix would then be\ngiven through our quantum-deformed R-matrix. It would be exciting to find out if this\nproposed picture is more than daydreaming.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are grateful to thank Fabian Spill for collaboration at earlier stages of\nthe project and for many discussions.

For example one may choose to eliminate all (x\u2212 )k with k 6=\n0, 1 (because the constraint is quadratic in x\u2212 ) in order to get a unique representative\nwithin the equivalence class of the expression. Unfortunately this particular expression\nis typically not the most economical one. However such a representative can be used for\nthe purpose to show that a certain expression is identically zero (or that two expressions\nare equivalent).\nIn this appendix we would like to present various identities involving the x\u00b1 which\nwere used in the paper or may prove useful otherwise.\n\n48\n\n\fOne Set of x\u00b1 .\ni\ni q \u22131 x\u00b1 s(x\u00b1 ) \u2212 12 (q + q \u22121 )\ni\n\u2212\n= qu(x ) +\n=\nu = q u(x ) \u2212\n2g\n2g\ng\nq \u2212 q \u22121\n\u22121\n\n+\n\nq \u22121 x+ s(x+ ) = qx\u2212 s(x\u2212 ) = \u2212ig(q \u2212 q \u22121 )u + 21 (q + q \u22121 )\n= \u2212igq \u22121 (q \u2212 q \u22121 )u(x+ ) + q \u22121\n= \u2212igq(q \u2212 q \u22121 )u(x\u2212 ) + q\nq C U \u2212 q \u2212C U \u22121\n= \u2212C\nq U \u2212 q C U \u22121\n(x+ )2 + 1 x\u2212 + s(x\u2212 )\nx+ \u2212 s(x\u2212 )\n=\n= q 2C U 2\nx\u2212 \u2212 s(x+ )\n(x\u2212 )2 + 1 x+ + s(x+ )\nq/x+ \u2212 q \u22121 /x\u2212 \u2212 ig \u22121 = \u2212\nqC U\n\nx+ \u2212 x\u2212\nx+ \u2212 x\u2212\n=\n\u2212\nq \u22121 x+ s(x+ )\nqx\u2212 s(x\u2212 )\n\n+ 2\nx+ \u2212 x\u2212\n(x\u2212 )2 + 1\n\u2212C \u22121 (x ) + 1\n=\nq\nU\n=\nx\u2212 + s(x\u2212 )\nx+ + s(x+ )\nq C U \u2212 q \u2212C U \u22121\n\n(A.2)\n\n(A.3)\n\n(A.4)\n(A.5)\n(A.6)\n\nOne y.\ny 2 + 1 s(y)2 + 1\n= 1 \u2212 (q \u2212 q \u22121 )2 g 2\ny + s(y) y + s(y)\nu(y) =\n\ni ys(y) \u2212 1\ng q \u2212 q \u22121\n\n(A.7)\n(A.8)\n\nOne Set of x\u00b1 and a y.\nx+ \u2212 s(y) s(x\u2212 ) \u2212 y\n= q 2C U 2\n\u2212\n+\nx \u2212 s(y) s(x ) \u2212 y\n\n(A.9)\n\nx+ \u2212 y s(x+ ) \u2212 y\nu(x+ ) \u2212 u(y)\n=\nx\u2212 \u2212 y s(x\u2212 ) \u2212 y\nu(x\u2212 ) \u2212 u(y)\n\n(A.10)\n\nTwo Sets of x\u00b1 .\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\nx+\nx+\n1 \u2212 s(x2 ) s(x1 ) \u2212 x2\n1 \u2212 x2 s(x1 ) \u2212 s(x2 )\n2C1 +2C2 2 2\n=\nU1 U2\n\u2212\n+\n+\n\u2212\n+\n+\n\u2212 = q\n)\n)\nx\u2212\n\u2212\nx\ns(x\n)\n\u2212\ns(x\nx\n\u2212\ns(x\ns(x\n)\n\u2212\nx\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n+ +\n+\nx+\n1 \u2212 x2 x1 \u2212 s(x2 )\n2C1 +2 2\nU1\n\u2212\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2212 = q\nx1 \u2212 x2 x1 \u2212 s(x2 )\n\n\u2212 +\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\nx+\n1 \u2212 x2 x1 \u2212 s(x2 )\n2C1 2 u(x1 ) \u2212 u(x2 )\n=\nq\nU\n1\n+ \u2212\n+\n+\nx\u2212\nu(x\u2212\n1 \u2212 x2 x1 \u2212 s(x2 )\n1 ) \u2212 u(x2 )\n\n49\n\n(A.11)\n\n(A.12)\n(A.13)\n\n\f(C1 , P1\u2032 , K1\u2032 )\n\n(C2 , P2\u2032 , K2\u2032 )\n\nS12\n(C1 , P1 , K1 )\n\n(C2 , P2 , K2 )\n\nFigure 4: Scattering process and transformation of central charges.\n\nB\n\nBraiding from Scattering Problem\n\nAn equivalent approach to derive and incorporate the braiding factors for the coproduct\n(2.45) is based on using an S-matrix which acts as a permutation operator and commutes\nwith the coproduct [\u2206(J), S] = 0 for each generator J \u2208 Uq (h). This relation is equivalent\nto cocommutativity (2.49) upon identifying the S-matrix with the R-matrix as usual\nS = PR.\nWhat we want to stress here is the fact that for the quantum deformed case the introduction of the braiding in the coproduct is necessary to allow for a quasi cocommutative\nHopf algebra. If one would only take the quantum-deformed algebra with the coproduct\n(2.37) there cannot be any R-matrix which transforms \u2206 to \u2206op for the central elements.\nWe will identify the additional braiding element with the central charges in such way\nthat the coproduct will indeed become cocommutative on the center.\nIn particular, let us consider two short modules with central charges hC1 , P1 , K1 i and\nhC2 , P2 , K2 i. For the coproduct (2.37) we have\n\u2206(P) = P \u2297 1 + q 2C \u2297 P,\n\n(B.1)\n\n\u2206op (P) = 1 \u2297 P + P \u2297 q 2C .\n\n(B.2)\n\nbut\nWe need to change the coproduct by introducing an additional braiding factor to make\nit quasi-cocommutative. The importance of having a quasi-cocommutative Hopf algebra\nlies in the fact that they have an R-matrix which not only intertwines the modules, but\nsatisfies the quasi-triangularity condition from which the Yang\u2013Baxter equation follows.\nPairwise Scattering. Now we will consider the representation structure when the Smatrix acts on chains of multiplets. First we consider the scattering matrix of two short\nmultiplets (see Fig. 4)\n~ 1 i \u2297 hC\n~ 2 i \u2212\u2192 hC\n~ 0 i \u2297 hC\n~ 0 i.\nS12 : hC\n(B.3)\n2\n1\nFor each generator J \u2208 Uq (h) we want the S-matrix to be invariant\n[\u2206(J), S] = 0.\nIn particular, this relation must hold for the central charges.\n50\n\n(B.4)\n\n\fAn obvious way to conserve the total charge C1 + C2 is to demand that the individual\ncharges are merely interchanged\nC10 = C1 ,\n\nC20 = C2 .\n\n(B.5)\n\nTaking the coproduct (2.37) of the other central charges P, K and evaluating them before\nand after scattering we have\nP1 + P2 q 2C1 = P20 + P10 q 2C2 ,\nK1 q \u22122C2 + K2 = K20 q \u22122C1 + K10 .\n\n(B.6)\n\nCombining the short multiplet constraint (2.29) with (B.5) we have the following equations to be solved\nP1 K1 = P10 K10 , P2 K2 = P20 K20 .\n(B.7)\nThe substitution\nP1 = 1 \u2212 q 2C1 U1 ,\nP2 = (1 \u2212 q 2C2 U2 )U1 ,\n\nK1 = q \u22122C1 \u2212 U1\u22121 ,\nK2 = (q \u22122C2 \u2212 U2\u22121 )U1\u22121\n\n(B.8)\n\nsimplifies the calculations dramatically and we get10\nP10 = (1 \u2212 q 2C1 U1 )U2 ,\nP20 = 1 \u2212 q 2C2 U2 ,\n\nK10 = (q \u22122C1 \u2212 U1\u22121 )U2\u22121 ,\nK20 = q \u22122C2 \u2212 U2\u22121 .\n\n(B.9)\n\nFactorized Scattering. A basic requirement for a factorized K-particle S-matrix S\u03c0\nfor any permutation \u03c0 \u2208 SK is that it forms a representation of the permutation group\nSK , i.e. S\u03c0 S\u03c00 = S\u03c0\u03c00 . It imposes certain relations on Pi and Ki . We consider the\npermutation that interchanges three modules as follows\n~ 1 i \u2297 hC\n~ 2 i \u2297 hC\n~ 3 i 7\u2192 hC\n~ 30 i \u2297 hC\n~ 10 i \u2297 hC\n~ 20 i.\nS\u03c0 : hC\n\n(B.10)\n\nThis process can be represented in two different ways. The factorized scatterings (23 \u2192\n30 20 and 10 30 \u2192 300 100 ) lead to the following relations\nP30 = P2 + P3 q 2C2 \u2212 P20 q 2C3 ,\n\nP10 = P1\n\n(B.11)\n\nfor the process 23 \u2192 30 20 and\nP300 = P10 + P30 q 2C1 \u2212 P100 q 2C3\n= (P1 + P2 q 2C1 ) \u2212 (P10 + P20 q 2C1 )q 2C3 + P3 q 2C1 +2C2 ,\nP200 = P20\n\n(B.12)\n\nfor the process 10 30 \u2192 300 100 .\nThere are two roots for the second order equation \u2013 one of them corresponds to trivial scattering\nand we did not mention it here.\n10\n\n51\n\n\fFusion. Furthermore, the overall process can be represented as a pairwise scattering\n~ 12 i with hC\n~ 3 i. The former multiplet is long but for particular\nof composite multiplet hC\n~ 1 and C\n~ 2 it splits into two short multiplets. The central charges P 0\nvalues of C\n1,2,3 and\n0\nK1,2,3 become related by the following constraints\nP1 + P2 q 2C1 + P3 q 2C1 +2C2 = P30 + P10 q 2C3 + P20 q 2C1 +2C3 ,\nK1 q \u22122C2 \u22122C3 + K2 q \u22122C3 + K3 = K30 q \u22122C1 \u22122C2 + K10 q \u22122C2 + K20 .\n\n(B.13)\n\nThe results (B.12) and solution of (B.13) should correspond and it constrains the form\nof central charges. An educated guess consists in choosing them in the following way\nPk = g\u03b1(1 \u2212 q\nKk =\n\n2Ck\n\nUk2 )\n\nk\u22121\nY\n\nUj2 ,\n\nj=1\n\nk\u22121\nY\ng \u22122Ck\n\u2212 Uk\u22122 )\n(q\nUj\u22122 .\n\u03b1\nj=1\n\n(B.14)\n\nwhich completely agrees with (2.52).\nThe following remark is noteworthy here. We have derived the dependence of the\ncentral charges P and K on the braiding factors U by demanding the condition that\nscattering with a pair of particles can be treated as a successive scattering with one\nparticle and then with another one. Alternatively we can treat U as a function of P and\nK and put U U \u22121 = 1 as a constraint (which is for sure satisfied in (B.8) automatically).\nIf this constraint is not satisfied then the Hopf algebra for h = su(2|2) n R2 cannot be\nquasi-triangular. We can drop one central charge (say K and thus have su(2|2) n R1\nalgebra) then this relation does not constrain us any longer and the Hopf algebra based\non su(2|2) n R1 is quasi-triangular.\nFundamental S-Matrix. We write down the explicit form of the fundamental Smatrix S = PR in Tab. 6. Its coefficients are the same as for the fundamental R-matrix\ngiven in Tab. 2.\n\nReferences\n[1] V. G.
