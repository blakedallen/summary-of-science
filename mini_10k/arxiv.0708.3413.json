We show that a finite, connected quiver Q without oriented cycles is a Dynkin or\nEuclidean quiver if and only if all orbit semigroups of representations of Q are saturated.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe representation type of a quiver reflects the complexity of its indecomposable representations. There are three distinct classes: finite type, tame, and wild quivers. A quiver is said to\nbe of finite type if there are only finitely many indecomposable representations. We say that a\nquiver is tame if it is not of finite representation type, and in each dimension all but finitely many\nindecomposable representations come in a finite number of 1-parameter families. Finally, we call\na quiver wild if its representation theory is at least as complicated as that of a free algebra in two\n(non-commuting) variables. For precise definitions, we refer to [3, Ch. 4].\nGabriel's classical result [16] identifies the connected quivers of finite type as being those whose\nunderlying graphs are the Dynkin diagrams of types A, D, or E. Later on, Nazarova [23] and\nDonovan-Freislich [15] found the tame, connected quivers. Their underlying graphs are the Eue D,\ne or E.\ne The remaining connected quivers are the wild ones.\nclidean diagrams of types A,\nIt is an important and interesting task to find geometric characterizations of the representation\ntype of a quiver (or more generally, of finite dimensional algebras). In [31, Theorem 1], Skowro\u0144ski\nand Weyman showed that a finite, connected quiver is a Dynkin or Euclidean quiver if and only if\nthe various algebras of semi-invariants are always complete intersections. In this paper, we provide\na different characterization of the representation type in terms of saturated orbit semigroups.\nLet Q be a quiver and \u03b2 a dimension vector. Following [4, Definition 2.1], we define the orbit\nsemigroup of a representation W \u2208 Rep(Q, \u03b2) to be\nS(W )Q = {\u03c3 \u2208 ZQ0 | \u2203f \u2208 SI(Q, \u03b2)\u03c3 such that f (W ) 6= 0}.\nThe cones generated by the semigroups S(W )Q play a fundamental role in the construction of the\nGIT-fans for quivers (see [8] and the reference therein). Furthermore, Derksen-Weyman saturation\ntheorem [11] for semi-invariants tells us that S(W )Q are saturated for generic representations.\nHowever, there are quiver representations whose orbit semigroups are not saturated. We refer to\nSection 2 for background material on quiver invariant theory. Throughout this paper, we work\nover an algebraically closed field k of characteristic zero.\nNow, we are ready to state our main result:\nTheorem 1.1. Let Q be a finite, connected quiver without oriented cycles. The following are\nequivalent:\n(1) Q is a Dynkin or Euclidean quiver;\n(2) for every dimension vector \u03b2, the semigroup S(W )Q is saturated for every W \u2208 Rep(Q, \u03b2).\nDate: 25 August, 2007; Revised: October 24, 2018.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Orbit semigroups, semi-invariants, quivers.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nCALIN CHINDRIS\n\nTo show that orbit semigroups for Dynkin or Euclidean quivers are saturated, we use DerksenWeyman spanning theorem and a theorem of Schofield on Kac's canonical decomposition for\ndimension vectors. This allows us to give a short, conceptual proof avoiding a case-by-case\nanalysis. To deal with wild quivers, we use reflection functors, shrinking methods and exceptional\nsequences to reduce the list of wild quivers to the generalized Kronecker quiver with three arrows.\nThe layout of this paper is as follows. Background material on quiver invariant theory is\nreviewed in Section 2. In particular, we recall Derksen-Weyman spanning and saturation theorems.\nIn Section 3, we first recall Schofield's theorem on canonical decompositions and then we prove\nthe necessary part of our theorem. Reflection functors, the shrinking method, and exceptional\nsequences are reviewed in Section 4 where we show that these reduction methods behave nicely\nwith respect to saturated orbit semigroups. We complete the proof of Theorem 1.1 in Section\n5 by showing that for every wild quiver without oriented cycles there is a representation whose\norbit semigroup is not saturated. The last section discusses the thin sincere case. In this case, we\nshow that the orbit semigroups are saturated.\nAcknowledgement. I am grateful to Harm Derksen and Jerzy Weyman for helpful discussions\non the subject, especially regarding some of the examples from Section 5. I would also like to\nthank Ben Howard for stimulating discussions on his results from [18]. Many thanks are also due\nto the referee for a very thorough report which helped improved the paper.\n2. Recollection from quiver invariant theory\nLet Q = (Q0 , Q1 , t, h) be a finite quiver, where Q0 is the set of vertices, Q1 is the set of arrows\nand t, h : Q1 \u2192 Q0 assign to each arrow a \u2208 Q1 its tail ta and head ha, respectively.\nIn this paper, we work over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic zero. A representation\nV of Q over k is a collection (V (x), V (a))x\u2208Q0 ,a\u2208Q1 of finite dimensional k-vector spaces V (x),\nx \u2208 Q0 , and k-linear maps V (a) \u2208 Homk (V (ta), V (ha)), a \u2208 Q1 . If V is a representation of Q,\nwe define its dimension vector dV by dV (x) = dimk V (x) for every x \u2208 Q0 . Thus the dimension\nvectors of representations of Q lie in \u0393 = ZQ0 , the set of all integer-valued functions on Q0 .\nGiven two representations V and W of Q, we define a morphism \u03c6 : V \u2192 W to be a collection\nof k-linear maps (\u03c6(x))x\u2208Q0 with \u03c6(x) \u2208 Homk (V (x), W (x)), x \u2208 Q0 , and such that \u03c6(ha)V (a) =\nW (a)\u03c6(ta) for every arrow a \u2208 Q1 . We denote by HomQ (V, W ) the k-vector space of all morphisms\nfrom V to W . Let W and V be two representations of Q. We say that V is a subrepresentation\nof W if V (x) is a subspace of W (x) for all vertices x \u2208 Q0 and V (a) is the restriction of W (a)\nto V (ta) for all arrows a \u2208 Q1 . In this way, we obtain the abelian category Rep(Q) of all quiver\nrepresentations of Q.\nA representation W is said to be a Schur representation if EndQ (W ) \u223c\n= k. The dimension\nvector of a Schur representation is called a Schur root.\nFrom now on, we assume that our quivers are without oriented cycles. For two\nquiver representations V and W , consider Ringel's canonical exact sequence [25] :\nM\nM\ndV\nW\nHomk (V (ta), W (ha)),\nHomk (V (x), W (x))\u2212\u2192\n(1)\n0 \u2192 HomQ (V, W ) \u2192\na\u2208Q1\n\nx\u2208Q0\n\nwhere dVW ((\u03c6(x))x\u2208Q0 ) = (\u03c6(ha)V (a) \u2212 W (a)\u03c6(ta))a\u2208Q1 and Ext1Q (V, W ) = coker(dVW ).\nIf \u03b1, \u03b2 are two elements of \u0393, we define the Euler inner product by\nX\nX\n\u03b1(ta)\u03b2(ha).\n\u03b1(x)\u03b2(x) \u2212\n(2)\nh\u03b1, \u03b2iQ =\nx\u2208Q0\n\na\u2208Q1\n\n\f3\n\n(When no confusion arises, we drop the subscript Q.) It follows from (1) and (2) that\nhdV , dW i = dimk HomQ (V, W ) \u2212 dimk Ext1Q (V, W ).\n2.1. Semi-invariants of quivers. For every vertex x, we denote by ex the simple dimension\nvector corresponding to x, i.e., ex (y) = \u03b4x,y , \u2200y \u2208 Q0 , where \u03b4x,y is the Kronecker symbol.\nLet \u03b2 be a dimension vector of Q. The representation space of \u03b2\u2212dimensional representations\nof Q is\nM\nHomk (k\u03b2(ta) , k\u03b2(ha) ).\nRep(Q, \u03b2) =\nQ\n\na\u2208Q1\n\nIf GL(\u03b2) = x\u2208Q0 GL(\u03b2(x)) then GL(\u03b2) acts algebraically on Rep(Q, \u03b2) by simultaneous conjugation, i.e., for g = (g(x))x\u2208Q0 \u2208 GL(\u03b2) and W = (W (a))a\u2208Q1 \u2208 Rep(Q, \u03b2), we define g * W\nby\n(g * W )(a) = g(ha)W (a)g(ta)\u22121 for each a \u2208 Q1 .\n\nHence, Rep(Q, \u03b2) is a rational representation of the linearly reductive group GL(\u03b2) and the\nGL(\u03b2)\u2212orbits in Rep(Q, \u03b2) are in one-to-one correspondence with the isomorphism classes of\n\u03b2\u2212dimensional representations of Q. As Q is a quiver without oriented cycles, one can show\nthat there is only one closed GL(\u03b2)\u2212orbit in Rep(Q, \u03b2) and hence the invariant ring I(Q, \u03b2) =\nk[Rep(Q, \u03b2)]GL(\u03b2) is exactly the base field k.\nNow, consider the subgroup SL(\u03b2) \u2286 GL(\u03b2) defined by\nY\nSL(\u03b2(x)).\nSL(\u03b2) =\nx\u2208Q0\n\nAlthough there are only constant GL(\u03b2)\u2212invariant polynomial functions on Rep(Q, \u03b2), the\naction of SL(\u03b2) on Rep(Q, \u03b2) provides us with a highly non-trivial ring of semi-invariants. Note\nthat any \u03c3 \u2208 ZQ0 defines a rational character of GL(\u03b2) by\nY\n(det g(x))\u03c3(x) .\n(g(x))x\u2208Q0 \u2208 GL(\u03b2) 7\u2192\nx\u2208Q0\n\nIn this way, we can identify \u0393 = ZQ0 with the group X \u22c6 (GL(\u03b2)) of rational characters of GL(\u03b2),\nassuming that \u03b2 is a sincere dimension vector (i.e., \u03b2(x) > 0 for all vertices x \u2208 Q0 ). In general,\nwe have only the epimorphism \u0393 \u2192 X \u2217 (GL(\u03b2)), but we usually do not distinguish between \u03c3 and\nits image in X \u2217 (GL(\u03b2)). We also refer to the rational characters of GL(\u03b2) as (integral) weights.\nLet SI(Q, \u03b2) = k[Rep(Q, \u03b2)]SL(\u03b2) be the ring of semi-invariants. As SL(\u03b2) is the commutator\nsubgroup of GL(\u03b2) and GL(\u03b2) is linearly reductive, we have\nM\nSI(Q, \u03b2) =\nSI(Q, \u03b2)\u03c3 ,\n\u03c3\u2208X \u22c6 (GL(\u03b2))\n\nwhere\nSI(Q, \u03b2)\u03c3 = {f \u2208 k[Rep(Q, \u03b2)] | g * f = \u03c3(g)f for all g \u2208 GL(\u03b2)}\nis the space of semi-invariants of weight \u03c3.\nIf \u03b1 \u2208 ZQ0 , we define the weight \u03c3 = h\u03b1, *i by\n\u03c3(x) = h\u03b1, ex i, \u2200x \u2208 Q0 .\nConversely, it is easy to see that for any weight \u03c3 \u2208 ZQ0 there is a unique \u03b1 \u2208 ZQ0 (not necessarily\na dimension vector) such that \u03c3 = h\u03b1, *i. Similarly, one can define \u03bc = h*, \u03b1i.\n\n\f4\n\nCALIN CHINDRIS\n\nIn [27], Schofield constructed semi-invariants of quivers with remarkable properties. Let \u03b1, \u03b2\nbe two dimension vectors such that h\u03b1, \u03b2i = 0. Following [27], we define\nc : Rep(Q, \u03b1) \u00d7 Rep(Q, \u03b2) \u2192 k\ndet(dVW ).\n\nby c(V, W ) =\nNote that dVW from (1) is indeed a square matrix since h\u03b1, \u03b2i = 0. Fix\n(V, W ) \u2208 Rep(Q, \u03b1) \u00d7 Rep(Q, \u03b2). Then it is easy to see that cV = c(V, *) : Rep(Q, \u03b2) \u2192 k is a\nsemi-invariant of weight h\u03b1, *i and cW = c(*, W ) : Rep(Q, \u03b1) \u2192 k is a semi-invariant of weight\n\u2212h*, \u03b2i.\nRemark 2.1. We should point out that if V is an \u03b1-dimensional representation not necessarily\nin Rep(Q, \u03b1), the semi-invariant cV is well-defined on Rep(Q, \u03b2) up to a non-zero scalar.\nGiven two representations V and W , we say that V is orthogonal to W , and write V \u22a5 W , if\nExt1Q (V, W ) = HomQ (V, W ) = 0.\nRemark 2.2. Using the exact sequence (1) for two representations V and W , we deduce that\ncV (W ) 6= 0 if and only if V \u22a5 W .\n2.2. The Spanning and Saturation Theorems. A very important property of the Schofield\nsemi-invariants is that each weight space of semi-invariants is spanned by such semi-invariants.\nThis is a fundamental result proved by Derksen and Weyman [11] (see also [29]).\nTheorem 2.3 (The Spanning Theorem). [11] Let \u03b2 be a sincere dimension vector of Q and let\n\u03c3 = h\u03b1, *i be a weight with \u03b1 \u2208 ZQ0 . If the weight space of semi-invariants SI(Q, \u03b2)\u03c3 is non-zero\nthen \u03b1 is a dimension vector, and moreover, SI(Q, \u03b2)\u03c3 is spanned by the semi-invariants cV with\nV \u2208 Rep(Q, \u03b1).\nRecall that for a given representation W \u2208 Rep(Q, \u03b2), its orbit semigroup is\nS(W )Q = {\u03c3 \u2208 ZQ0 | \u2203f \u2208 SI(Q, \u03b2)\u03c3 such that f (W ) 6= 0}.\n(When no confusion arises, we drop the subscript Q.)\nNow, let Q\u2032 be the full subquiver of Q whose vertex set is supp(W ) = {x \u2208 Q0 | W (x) 6= {0}}\nand denote by W \u2032 the restriction of W to Q\u2032 . If \u03c3 \u2208 ZQ0 is a weight, we denote by \u03c3 \u2032 its restriction\nto Q\u2032 . Also, any representation V \u2032 of Q\u2032 is viewed as a representation of Q in a natural way. Note\nthat S(W )Q is just the inverse image in ZQ0 of S(W \u2032 )Q\u2032 .\nFrom Remark 2.2 and Theorem 2.3, we deduce:\n0\nProposition 2.4. Let W \u2208 Rep(Q, \u03b2) be a representation and \u03c3 = h\u03b1, *i a weight with \u03b1 \u2208 ZQ\n\u22650 .\nThen,\n\n\u03c3 \u2208 S(W ) \u21d0\u21d2 \u2203V \u2208 Rep(Q, \u03b1) such that V \u22a5 W.\nConsequently,\nQ\u2032\n\n(3) S(W ) = {\u03c3 \u2208 ZQ0 | \u03c3 \u2032 = h\u03b1\u2032 , *iQ\u2032 with \u03b1\u2032 \u2208 Z\u226500 and \u2203V \u2032 \u2208 Rep(Q\u2032 , \u03b1\u2032 ) such that V \u2032 \u22a5 W }.\nAt this point, we can use (3) to define orbit semigroups for arbitrary representations. In this\nway, the orbit semigroup S(W ) is independent of the choice of the isomorphism class of W . We\nshould mention that Proposition 2.4 together with Theorem 3.1 below plays a crucial role in our\nstudy.\nUsing the Spanning Theorem and Schofield's theory of general representations [28], Derksen\nand Weyman proved the following remarkable result:\n\n\f5\n\nTheorem 2.5 (The Saturation Theorem). [11] Let Q be a quiver and \u03b2 a dimension vector.\nConsider the semigroup of integral effective weights:\n\u03a3(Q, \u03b2) = {\u03c3 \u2208 ZQ0 | SI(Q, \u03b2)\u03c3 6= 0}.\nThen, \u03a3(Q, \u03b2) is saturated, i.e., for any positive integer n and \u03c3 \u2208 ZQ0 ,\nn\u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3(Q, \u03b2) \u21d0\u21d2 \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3(Q, \u03b2).\nRemark 2.6. Let {f1 , . . . , fm } be a generating system of semi-invariants for SI(Q, \u03b2). Then,\nevery representation W \u2208 Rep(Q, \u03b2) with fi (W ) 6= 0, \u22001 \u2264 i \u2264 m has the property that S(W ) =\n\u03a3(Q, \u03b2). This shows that orbit semigroups are saturated for generic representations.\nRemark 2.7. It is worth pointing out that for star quivers, Theorem 2.5 implies the Saturation\nConjecture for Littlewood-Richardson coefficients (for more details, see [11] and [12]).\n3. Kac's canonical decomposition\nOne of the main tools that we use in this paper is Kac's canonical decomposition of dimension\nvectors. Let Q be a quiver and \u03b1 a dimension vector. Following [19], we say that\n\u03b1 = \u03b11 \u2295 * * * \u2295 \u03b1l\nis the canonical decomposition of \u03b1 if there is a non-empty open subset U \u2286 Rep(Q, \u03b1) such that\nevery V \u2208 U decomposes as a direct sum of indecomposables of dimension vectors \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1l . It\nwas proved by Kac that the dimension vectors occurring in the canonical decomposition of \u03b1 must\nbe Schur roots.\nRecall that a root of Q is just the dimension vector of an indecomposable representation of Q.\nWe say that a root \u03b1 is real if h\u03b1, \u03b1i = 1. If h\u03b1, \u03b1i = 0, \u03b1 is said to be an isotropic root. Finally,\nwe say that \u03b1 is a non-isotropic imaginary root if h\u03b1, \u03b1i < 0.\nIt is important to know how to obtain the canonical decomposition of a multiple of \u03b1 from that\nof \u03b1. Schofield's theorem gives an answer to this question:\nTheorem 3.1. [28, Theorem 3.8] Let \u03b1 = \u03b11 \u2295 * * * \u2295 \u03b1l be the canonical decomposition of \u03b1 and\nlet m \u2265 1. Then, the canonical decomposition of m\u03b1 is\nm\u03b1 = [m\u03b11 ] \u2295 * * * \u2295 [m\u03b1l ],\nwhere\n[m\u03b1i ] =\n\n(\n\n\u03b1\u2295m\n:= \u03b1i \u2295 * * * \u2295 \u03b1i\ni\nm\u03b1i\n\nif \u03b1i is a real or isotropic Schur root,\nif \u03b1i is a non-isotropic imaginary Schur root.\n\nNow, we are ready to prove:\nProposition 3.2. Let Q be a Dynkin or Euclidean quiver. Then the orbit semigroup S(W ) is\nsaturated for every representation W .\nProof. Assume that Q is a Dynkin or Euclidean quiver and let W \u2208 Rep(Q, \u03b2). We can clearly\nassume that \u03b2 is a sincere dimension vector. Let \u03c3 = h\u03b1, *i \u2208 ZQ0 be a weight with \u03b1 \u2208 ZQ0 .\nAssume n\u03c3 \u2208 S(W ) for some n \u2265 1. From Theorem 2.3, it follows that \u03b1 is a dimension vector.\nNow, consider the canonical decomposition of \u03b1:\n\u03b1 = \u03b11 \u2295 * * * \u2295 \u03b1l .\n\n\f6\n\nCALIN CHINDRIS\n\nSince Q is a Dynkin or Euclidean quiver, the Schur roots \u03b1i are either real or isotropic. Using\nTheorem 3.1, we obtain that the canonical decomposition of n\u03b1 is:\n\u2295n\nn\u03b1 = \u03b1\u2295n\n1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 \u03b1l .\n\nIt is well-known that the functions dimk Ext1Q (*, W ) and dimk HomQ (*, W ) are upper semicontinuous. This fact combined with Proposition 2.4 allows us to find a L\nrepresentation V \u2208\nl\nRep(Q, n\u03b1) such that V \u22a5 W and V has a direct summand of the form\ni=1 Vi with Vi an\nL\nindecomposable representation of dimension vector \u03b1i , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 l. Set Ve = li=1 Vi . Then, Ve is\nan \u03b1-dimensional representation with Ve \u22a5 W and hence \u03c3 \u2208 S(W ) by Proposition 2.4.\n\u0003\n4. Reflection functors, the shrinking method, and exceptional sequences\n\nIn this section, we describe three reduction methods that behave nicely with respect to orbit\nsemigroups. This will be particularly useful when dealing with wild quivers.\nA quiver Q is said to satisfy property (S) provided the following is true: For every representation\nW of Q, the orbit semigroup S(W ) is saturated. It is clear that if Q has property (S) then any\n(not necessarily full) subquiver has it.\n4.1. Reflection functors. Let Q be a quiver and x \u2208 Q0 a vertex. Define sx (Q) to be the\nquiver obtained from Q by reversing all arrows incident to x. The reflection transformation\nsx : ZQ0 \u2192 ZQ0 at vertex x is defined by\n(\n\u03b1(y)\nif y 6= x,\nsx (\u03b1)(y) = P\nP\nta=x \u03b1(ha) \u2212 \u03b1(x) if y = x.\nha=x \u03b1(ta) +\n\nNote that sx is the reflection in the plane orthogonal to the simple root ex .\nNow, let us assume that x is a sink. The Bernstein-Gelfand-Ponomarev reflection functor at x\nis defined as follows:\nCx+ : Rep(Q) \u2192 Rep(sx (Q))\nV 7\u2192 W = Cx+ (V ),\nL\nwhere W (y) = V (y) for y 6= x and W (x) = ker( ha=x V (ta) \u2192 V (x)).\nIf x is a source, we define Cx\u2212 by\nCx\u2212 : Rep(Q) \u2192 Rep(sx (Q))\n\nV 7\u2192 W = Cx\u2212 (V ),\nL\nwhere W (y) = V (y) for y 6= x and W (x) = coker(V (x) \u2192 ta=x V (ha)).\nThe following theorem, proved by Bernstein-Gelfand-Ponomarev, is one of the fundamental\nresults about reflection functors.\nTheorem 4.1. [5] Let Q be a quiver and x \u2208 Q0 a sink.\n(1) If V = Sx then Cx+ (V ) = 0.\n(2) If V 6= Sx is indecomposable then Cx+ (V ) is indecomposable, too. Furthermore, Cx\u2212 Cx+ (V ) =\nV and\ndCx+ (V ) = sx (dV ).\nThe analogous result for Cx\u2212 with x a source is also true.\n\n\f7\n\nUsing the First Fundamental Theorem for special linear groups (see for example [10]), Kac [20,\nSections 2 and 3] showed that reflection functors behave nicely with respect to semi-invariants of\nquivers. Other geometric properties that are preserved by reflection functors can be found in [7,\nSection 6]. We are going to show that property (S) defined above is also preserved by reflection\nfunctors. The following proposition will be very useful for us:\nProposition 4.2. [2] Let V and W be two representations of Q. Assume that x is a sink and Sx\nis not a direct summand of V or W . Then:\ndimk HomQ (V, W ) = dimk Homsx (Q) (Cx+ (V ), Cx+ (W )),\nand\ndimk Ext1Q (V, W ) = dimk Ext1sx (Q) (Cx+ (V ), Cx+ (W )).\nConsequently, one has\nV \u22a5 W \u21d0\u21d2 Cx+ (V ) \u22a5 Cx+ (W ).\nThe same is true when x is a source and Cx+ is replaced by Cx\u2212 .\nNext, we show that when checking property (S), we can actually avoid those representations\nthat have direct summands isomorphic to simple representations. We write Sx \u2224 W if W does not\nhave a direct summand isomorphic to Sx . A representation W whose dimension vector is sincere\nis called a sincere representation.\nLemma 4.3.\n(1) Let W = W1 \u2295 W2 be a representation with S(W1 ) and S(W2 ) saturated.\nThen, S(W ) is saturated, too.\n(2) Let x be a vertex of Q. Then, Q has property (S) if and only if S(W ) is saturated for\nevery representation W such that Sx \u2224 W .\nProof. (1) We can clearly assume that W is a sincere representation. From Proposition 2.4, it\nfollows that\nS(W ) \u2286 S(W1 ) \u2229 S(W2 ).\nNow, let \u03c3 \u2208 ZQ0 be so that n\u03c3 \u2208 S(W ) for some positive integer n. Then, \u03c3 = h\u03b1, *i for\na unique dimension vector \u03b1, and since S(Wi ) are assumed to be saturated, we obtain that\n\u03c3 \u2208 S(W1 ) \u2229 S(W2 ). This is equivalent to the existence of Vi \u2208 Rep(Q, \u03b1) such that\nExt1Q (Vi , Wi ) = HomQ (Vi , Wi ) = 0,\nfor i \u2208 {1, 2}. Using the upper semi-continuity of the functions dimk Ext1Q (*, Wi ) and dimk HomQ (*, Wi ),\ni \u2208 {1, 2}, we can find a representation V \u2208 Rep(Q, \u03b1) such that Ext1Q (V, Wi ) = HomQ (V, Wi ) =\n0, \u2200i \u2208 {1, 2}. Applying Proposition 2.4 again, we get \u03c3 \u2208 S(W ).\n(2) The proof follows from part (1) and the fact that the orbit semigroup of Sx is clearly\nsaturated.\n\u0003\nFor our purposes, we actually need to strengthen Lemma 4.3(2):\nLemma 4.4. Let W \u2208 Rep(Q, \u03b2) and x \u2208 Q0 . Consider the set\nSx (W ) = {\u03c3 = h\u03b1, *i \u2208 ZQ0 | \u2203V \u2208 Rep(Q, \u03b1) such that V \u22a5 W and Sx \u2224 V }.\nIf Sx (W ) is saturated then so is S(W ).\n\n\f8\n\nCALIN CHINDRIS\n\nProof. We distinguish two cases:\nCase 1: W is a sincere representation. Let \u03c3 = h\u03b1, *i \u2208 ZQ0 be a weight and assume that there\nexists an integer n > 1 such that n\u03c3 \u2208 S(W ).\nWe know that \u03b1 has to be a dimension vector by Theorem 2.3. Consider the canonical decomposition of \u03b1:\n\u03b1 = \u03b11 \u2295 * * * \u2295 \u03b1l .\nWithout loss of generality, let us assume that \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1m are the non-isotropic, imaginary Schur\nroots in the decomposition above (of course, we allow m to be zero). From Theorem 3.1, we\nobtain that\n\u2295n\nn\u03b1 = n\u03b11 \u2295 * * * \u2295 n\u03b1m \u2295 \u03b1\u2295n\nm+1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 \u03b1l\nis the canonical decomposition of n\u03b1.\nNow, choose an n\u03b1-dimensional representation V such that V \u22a5 W and\nm\nM\nM\nVi\u2032 \u2295\nV =\nVjk\ni=1\n\nm+1\u2264j\u2264l\n\n1\u2264k\u2264n\n\nVi\u2032\n\nwhere the\nare indecomposables of dimension vectors n\u03b1i , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m, and the Vjk are indecomposables of dimension vectors \u03b1j , 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n, m + 1 \u2264 j \u2264 l.\nNote that Vi\u2032 \u22a5 W and Sx \u2224 Vi\u2032 for every 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m. Since Sx (W ) is assumed to be saturated,\nit follows that h\u03b1i , *i \u2208 Sx (W ). So, we can choose \u03b1i -dimensional representations Vi such that\nVi \u22a5 W for L\nall 1 \u2264 i \u2264L\nm.\nl\nV\n\u2295\nSet U = m\nj=m+1 Vj1 . Then, U is an \u03b1-dimensional representation with U \u22a5 W and\ni=1 i\nthis finishes the proof in the sincere case.\nCase 2: W is not necessarily a sincere representation. Let Q\u2032 be the full subquiver of Q whose\nvertex set is supp(W ) = {x \u2208 Q0 | W (x) 6= {0}}. Denote by W \u2032 the restriction of W to Q\u2032 . Then,\nW \u2032 is a sincere representation of Q\u2032 and we clearly have that S(W )Q is saturated if and only if\nS(W \u2032 )Q\u2032 is saturated.\nNow, consider the following linear transformation:\n\u2032\n\nI : ZQ0 \u2192 ZQ0\n\u03c3 \u2032 = h\u03b1\u2032 , *iQ\u2032 \u2192 h\u03b1\u2032 , *iQ ,\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere any \u03b1\u2032 \u2208 ZQ0 is viewed as an element of ZQ0 in a natural way. Given a weight \u03c3 \u2032 \u2208 ZQ0 , we\nclearly have \u03c3 \u2032 \u2208 Sx (W \u2032 )Q\u2032 if and only if I(\u03c3 \u2032 ) \u2208 Sx (W )Q . Hence, Sx (W \u2032 )Q\u2032 must be saturated.\nBut now, this implies that S(W )Q is saturated, as well.\n\u0003\nNow, we are ready to prove:\nProposition 4.5. Let Q be a quiver without oriented cycles and let x be either a source or a sink.\nThen, Q satisfies property (S) if and only if so does sx (Q).\ne = sx (Q)\nProof. It is enough to show that Q satisfies property (S) assuming that x is a source and Q\nsatisfies (S). Let W 6= 0 be a representation of Q. By Lemma 4.3, we can assume that Sx \u2224 W and\nf) = W .\nf . Then, it follows from Theorem 4.1 that Sx \u2224 W\nf and C + (W\nlet us denote Cx\u2212 (W ) by W\nx\nNow, let \u03b1 be a dimension vector of Q. Using Theorem 4.1 again and then Proposition 4.2, we\nf ) e . But this latter set is saturated\ndeduce that h\u03b1, *iQ \u2208 Sx (W )Q if and only if hsx (\u03b1), *iQe \u2208 Sx (W\nQ\nby assumption and hence Sx (W ) must be saturated. The proof follows now from Lemma 4.4. \u0003\n\n\f9\n\n4.2. The shrinking method. Using the First Fundamental Theorem for general linear groups,\nit is often possible to shrink paths to just one arrow and still preserve weight spaces of semiinvariants. The following shrinking procedure appears in some form in [11], [13], [30], and [31].\nWe include a proof since it is straight forward.\nLemma 4.6. Let Q be a quiver and v0 a vertex such that near v0 , Q looks like:\nv1 TTTTa1\nTTT*\nb\n/w\njj4v0\nj\nj\nj\nja\nj\nj\nl\nvl\nSuppose that \u03b2 is a dimension vector and \u03c3 is a weight such that\n\u03b2(v0 ) \u2265 \u03b2(w) and \u03c3(v0 ) = 0.\nLet Q be the quiver defined by Q0 = Q0 \\ {v0 } and Q1 = (Q1 \\ {b, a1 , . . . , al }) \u222a {ba1 , . . . , bal }. If\n\u03b2 = \u03b2|Q and \u03c3 = \u03c3|Q are the restrictions of \u03b2 and \u03c3 to Q then\nSI(Q, \u03b2)\u03c3 \u223c\n= SI(Q, \u03b2)\u03c3 .\nProof. Consider the reduction map\n\u03c0 : Rep(Q, \u03b2) \u2192 Rep(Q, \u03b2),\ndefined by taking compositions of linear maps along the new arrows of Q. As \u03b2(v0 ) \u2265 \u03b2(w), we\nknow that \u03c0 is a surjective morphism and hence the induced comorphism \u03c0 \u22c6 is injective. Using\nthe First Fundamental Theorem for GL(\u03b2(v0 )) (see for example [10]), we obtain\n\u03c0 \u22c6 (k[Rep(Q, \u03b2)]) = k[Rep(Q, \u03b2)]GL(\u03b2(v0 )) .\nSince \u03c0 \u22c6 is a GL(\u03b2)-equivariant surjective linear map, GL(\u03b2) is linearly reductive, and \u03c3(v0 ) = 0,\nwe have that \u03c0 \u22c6 induces a surjective map from SI(Q, \u03b2)\u03c3 onto SI(Q, \u03b2)\u03c3 . (Note that at this point\nwe need the assumption that the base field is of characteristic zero.) So, \u03c0 \u22c6 defines an isomorphism\nfrom SI(Q, \u03b2)\u03c3 into SI(Q, \u03b2)\u03c3 and we are done.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.7. Note that the lemma above remains true when we reverse the orientation of the\narrows ai and b.\nKeeping the same notations as above, we have:\nProposition 4.8. If Q satisfies property (S) then so does Q.\n4.3. Exceptional sequences. A dimension vector \u03b2 is called a real Schur root if there exists\na representation W \u2208 Rep(Q, \u03b2) such that EndQ (W ) \u2243 k and Ext1Q (W, W ) = 0 (we call such a\nrepresentation exceptional). Note that if \u03b2 is a real Schur root then there exists a unique, up to\nisomorphism, exceptional \u03b2-dimensional representation.\nFor \u03b1 and \u03b2 two dimension vectors, consider the generic ext and hom:\nextQ (\u03b1, \u03b2) = min{dimk Ext1Q (V, W ) | (V, W ) \u2208 Rep(Q, \u03b1) \u00d7 Rep(Q, \u03b2)},\nand\nhomQ (\u03b1, \u03b2) = min{dimk HomQ (V, W ) | (V, W ) \u2208 Rep(Q, \u03b1) \u00d7 Rep(Q, \u03b2)}.\nGiven two dimension vectors \u03b1 and \u03b2, we write \u03b1 \u22a5 \u03b2 provided that extQ (\u03b1, \u03b2) = homQ (\u03b1, \u03b2) = 0.\nIf W is a representation, we define \u22a5 W to be the full subcategory of Rep(Q) consisting of all\nrepresentations V such that V \u22a5 W .\nDefinition 4.9. We say that (\u03b51 , . . . , \u03b5r ) is an exceptional sequence if\n\n\f10\n\nCALIN CHINDRIS\n\n(1) \u03b5i are real Schur roots;\n(2) \u03b5i \u22a5 \u03b5j for all 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 l.\nFollowing [12], a sequence (\u03b51 , . . . , \u03b5r ) is called a quiver exceptional sequence if it is exceptional\nand h\u03b5j , \u03b5i i \u2264 0 for all 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 l.\nA sequence (E1 , . . . , Er ) of exceptional representations is said to be a (quiver) exceptional sequence if the sequence of their dimension vectors (dE1 , . . . , dEr ) is a (quiver) exceptional sequence.\nNow, let \u03b5 = (\u03b51 , . . . , \u03b5r ) be a quiver exceptional sequence and let Ei \u2208 Rep(Q, \u03b5i ) be exceptional\nrepresentations. Construct a new quiver Q(\u03b5) with vertex set {1, . . . , r} and \u2212h\u03b5j , \u03b5i i arrows from\nj to i. Define C(\u03b5) to be the smallest full subcategory of Rep(Q) which contains E1 , . . . , Er and\nis closed under extensions, kernels of epimorphisms, and cokernels of monomorphisms.\nFor the remaining of this section, we assume that r \u2264 N \u2212 1, where N is the number of vertices\nof Q. We recall a very useful result from [12, Section 2.7] in a form that is convenient for us:\nProposition 4.10. [12] The category C(\u03b5) is naturally equivalent to Rep(Q(\u03b5)) with E1 , . . . , Er\nbeing the simple objects of C(\u03b5). Furthermore, the inverse functor from Rep(Q(\u03b5)) to C(\u03b5) is a\nfull exact embedding into Rep(Q).\nProof. As the \u03b5i are Schur roots and extQ (\u03b5i , \u03b5j ) = 0, \u2200i < j, we know that either homQ (\u03b5j , \u03b5i ) =\n0 or extQ (\u03b5j , \u03b5i ) = 0 by [28, Theorem 4.1]. This fact combined with h\u03b5j , \u03b5i i \u2264 0 implies\nhomQ (\u03b5j , \u03b5i ) = 0. But this is equivalent to HomQ (Ej , Ei ) = 0, \u2200i < j as the representations\nEi have dense orbits in Rep(Q, \u03b5i ). From [12, Lemma 2.36], it follows that E1 , . . . , Er are precisely the simple objects of C(\u03b5).\nUsing [27, Theorem 2.3] (see also [12]), we can (naturally) extend E1 , . . . , Er to an exceptional\nsequence of representations of the form E1 , . . . , Er , Er+1 , . . . , EN . Now, we have the equality\nC(\u03b5) = \u22a5 Er+1 \u2229 * * * \u2229 \u22a5 EN ,\nby [9, Lemma 4]. Applying [27, Theorem 2.3] again, we deduce that C(\u03b5) is naturally equivalent to\nthe category of representations of a quiver Q\u2032 without oriented cycles and r vertices. Furthermore,\nthe inverse functor from Rep(Q\u2032 ) to C(\u03b5) is a full exact embedding into Rep(Q). But now, it is\nclear that Q\u2032 must be precisely Q(\u03b5).\n\u0003\nRemark 4.11. Let us point out that for a complete quiver exceptional sequence \u03b5, the corresponding exceptional representations Ei are precisely the simple representations of Q as it was\nshown by Ringel [26, Theorem 3].\nFrom Proposition 2.4 and Proposition 4.10, we deduce:\nProposition 4.12. Let \u03b5 = (\u03b51 , . . . , \u03b5r ) be a quiver exceptional sequence for Q. If property (S)\nfails for Q(\u03b5) then the same is true for Q.\n5. Wild quivers\nIn this section, we show that for every wild quiver Q without oriented cycles there is a representation W such that S(W ) is not saturated. Our strategy is very similar to the one from [31,\nSection 6]. More precisely, we use reflection functors and the shrinking method to reduce the list\nof wild quivers to just seven quivers. Then, we use exceptional sequences to further reduce this\nlist to the generalized Kronecker quiver with three arrows.\nExample 5.1 (Generalized Kronecker quivers). Let \u03b8(3) be the generalized Kronecker quiver\nwith two vertices and three arrows:\n_**4\n*\n\n\f11\n\nLabel the three arrows by a, b, and c. Now, choose W \u2208 Rep(\u03b8(3), (3, 3)) so that W (a), W (b),\nand W (c) are linearly independent skew-symmetric 3 \u00d7 3 matrices. If \u03c3 = (1, \u22121) then it is easy\nto see that \u03c3(dW \u2032 ) \u2264 0 for every subrepresentation W \u2032 of W (i.e., W is \u03c3-semi-stable). By King\nsemi-stability criterion [21], this is means that n\u03c3 \u2208 S(W ) for some integer n \u2265 1.\nOn the other hand, we claim that \u03c3 \u2208\n/ S(W ). Indeed, the weight space SI(\u03b8(3), (3, 3))\u03c3 is\nspanned by the coefficients of the functional determinant:\nW \u2192 det(t1 W (a) + t2 W (b) + t3 W (c))\nas a polynomial in the variables t1 , t2 , and t3 . But 3 \u00d7 3 skew symmetric matrices have zero\ndeterminant, and hence, f (W ) = 0 for every semi-invariant f of weight \u03c3. This shows that S(W )\nis not saturated.\nThe following combinatorial result is essentially taken from [31, Proposition 49] (see also [1,\nLemma 2.1, pp. 253]):\nProposition 5.2. Let Q be a finite, connected, wild quiver without oriented cycles. Then Q contains a subquiver which can be reduced to one of the following seven quivers by applying reflection\ntransformations and shrinking paths to arrows:\n(a)\n_**4\n*\n(b)\n*\n(c)\n\n+3*\n\n*OOOO\no*\nOO' wooooo\n/\nO\ng\n7\n* ooo* OOO\nOO\no\n*oo\n*\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\n*\n\n/*\n\n*\n\n/*\n\no*7\nooo\n/*oOoOO /*\nOOO\n*'\n\n*/ OOOO\nOO'\n/*\no7/*\no\no\n/*ooo\n\n*\n*\n(f)\n\n(g)\n\n*/\n\n*\n\n*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n*\n\n*/\n\n*/ OOOO\nO\n*/ ooOo*'/7\no\n*oo\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n*\nProof. Similar to [31, Proposition 49].\n\n*/ OOOO\nOO'\n/*\n/\noo7*\no\no\no\no\n*\n\u0003\n\nRemark 5.3. Note that the first two quivers on our list differ than the first two from [31,\nProposition 49]. This is because we are shrinking paths to arrows instead of shrinking arrows to\nloops (or identity) as in the aforementioned paper. Also, our subquiver Q\u2032 is not necessarily a full\nsubquiver.\n\n\f12\n\nCALIN CHINDRIS\n\nProposition 5.4. Let Q be one of the quivers from the list obtained in Proposition 5.2. Then,\nthere exists a representation W \u2208 Rep(Q, \u03b2) such that S(W ) is not saturated.\nProof. We have seen in Example 5.1 that our proposition is true for the quiver of type (a).\nNext, we use exceptional sequences to embed this generalized Kronecker quiver into each of the\nremaining six quivers.\nFor the quiver\n+3*\n*\n*/\nof type (b), we take \u03b51 = (0, 0, 1) and \u03b52 = (2, 3, 0).\nFor the quiver\n*OOOO\no*\nOO' wooooo\n/\nO\ng\n7\n* ooo* OOO\nOO\no\n*oo\n*\n1\n1\n0\n0\nof type (c), we take \u03b51 = 1 3 , \u03b52 = 0 0 .\n1\n0\n0\n1\nFor the quiver\noo7*\nooo /\no\n/\n/\nO\n*\n*\n* OOO *\nOO'\n*\n0\n1\n0\nof type (d), take \u03b51 = 0 0 0 0, \u03b52 = 0 1 2 1, \u03b53 = 1 0 0 0.

The implication \" =\u21d2 \" is proved in Proposition 3.2. The other implication\nfollows from Proposition 5.4 and Proposition 4.5, Proposition 4.8, Proposition 4.12.\n\u0003\nRemark 5.5. We would like to end this section with some comments about the possibility of\nextending our theorem to other classes of algebras. First of all, it is obvious how to define orbit\nsemigroups for finite dimensional modules over finite dimensional algebras. Furthermore, some\nof the main tools used in the proof of Theorem 1.1, such as Derksen-Weyman spanning theorem\nand Kac's canonical decomposition, are available for finite dimensional algebras as well. It is\nalso useful to know if Schofield's theorem [28, Theorem 3.8] extends to other classes of algebras.\nThis is clearly the case for regular dimension vectors for concealed-canonical algebras (for more\ndetails, see [14, pp. 382]). This opens the possibility of proving our theorem for this class of\nalgebras. Finally, let us mention that for canonical algebras, the implication \" \u21d0= \" of Theorem\n1.1 follows from its validity for quivers. Indeed, from [24] we know that a canonical algebra \u039b\nwith underlying quiver \u2206 is tame if and only if \u2206 \\ {\u221e} is a Dynkin or Euclidean quiver. (Here,\n\u221e is the unique sink of \u2206.) Now, we can see that by working with representations of \u039b which are\nzero at the sink \u221e, the implication \" \u21d0= \" of Theorem 1.1 for canonical algebras follows.\n6. The thin sincere case\nIn this section we look into the case when the dimension vector 1 is thin sincere, i.e., 1(x) =\n1, \u2200x \u2208 Q0 . Let us fix some notation first. For an affine G-variety X, where G is a linear algebraic\ngroup, and \u03c3 \u2208 X \u2217 (G) a rational character of G, we set\nSI(X, G)\u03c3 := {f \u2208 k[X] | g * f = \u03c3(g)f, \u2200g \u2208 G}.\nFor a given representation W \u2208 Rep(Q, 1), we have\nS(W ) = {\u03c3 \u2208 ZQ0 | \u2203f \u2208 SI(GL(1)W , GL(1))\u03c3 such that f (W ) 6= 0}.\nConsider the weight space decomposition:\nk[GL(1)W ] = k[GL(1)W ]SL(1) =\n\nM\n\nSI(GL(1)W , GL(1))\u03c3 ,\n\nwhere the sum is over all weights \u03c3 \u2208 S(W ). As GL(1) acts with a dense orbit on the closure of\nthe orbit of W , we must have dimk SI(GL(1)W , GL(1))\u03c3 \u2264 1, and so,\nk[GL(1)W ] = k[S(W )].\nFrom toric geometry, we deduce that if S(W ) is saturated then GL(1)W is normal. We should\npoint out that this last observation is not true for other dimension vectors as the following example,\ndue to Zwara, shows.\nExample 6.1. Consider the Kronecker quiver \u03b8(2):\n1\n\n+32\n\nwith\n\uf8eb arrows\n\uf8eb b. Let\uf8f6W \u2208 Rep(\u03b8(2), (3, 3)) be the representation given by W (a) =\n\uf8f6 labeled by a and\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\n\uf8ed1 0 0\uf8f8 and W (b) = \uf8ed0 0 0\uf8f8. It was proved by Zwara [32] that GL(\u03b1)W is not normal.\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\nOn the other hand, Proposition 3.2 tells us that S(W ) is saturated. In fact, in this example it\nis not difficult to see that S(W ) = {(0, 0)}. Indeed, it was first proved by Happel [17] (see also\n[22]) that the algebra of semi-invariants SI(\u03b8(2), (3, 3)) is (a polynomial algebra) generated by the\ncoefficients of the functional determinant:\nW \u2192 det(t1 W (a) + t2 W (b))\n\n\f14\n\nCALIN CHINDRIS\n\nas a polynomial in the variables t1 , t2 . But, for our choice of W (a) and W (b), det(t1 W (a) +\nt2 W (b)) = 0 and hence S(W ) = {(0, 0)}.\nIn [6, Theorem 1.3], it was proved that GL(1)W is normal when W \u2208 Rep(Q, 1) is just the\nidentity along the arrows. We are going to see that this is the case for any representation W by\nshowing that S(W ) is saturated. In the thin sincere case, it is rather easy to write down a k-basis\nfor each weight space of semi-invariants. Consider the boundary map I = IQ : RQ1 \u2192 RQ0 of Q;\nthis is the function which assigns to every \u03bb = (\u03bb(a))a\u2208Q1 , the vector (I(\u03bb)x )x\u2208Q0 , where\nX\nX\nI(\u03bb)x :=\n\u03bb(a) \u2212\n\u03bb(a),\na\u2208Q1\n\na\u2208Q1\n\nta=x\n\nha=x\n\nfor every vertex x \u2208 Q0 . Let us record the following simple lemma:\nLemma 6.2. Keep notation as above. Let \u03c3 \u2208 ZQ0 be a weight. Then\n\\\n1\ndimk SI(Q, 1)\u03c3 = |I \u22121 (\u03c3) ZQ\n\u22650 |.\n\nProof. For convenience, denote V (x) = k, \u2200x \u2208 Q0 . If V is a vector space, we denote by detlV , the\nlth power of the determinant representation of GL(V ); the symmetric algebra of V is denoted by\nS(V ). It is easy to see that\nO\nS(V (ta) \u2297 V (ha)\u2217 )\nk[Rep(Q, 1)] =\na\u2208Q1\n\n=\n\nO\n\nM\n\n\u03bb(a)\n\n\u2212\u03bb(a)\n\ndetV (ta) \u2297 detV (ha)\n\na\u2208Q1 \u03bb(a)\u2208Z\u22650\n\n=\n\nM O\n\nI(\u03bb)\n\ndetV (x)x\n\nQ\n\u03bb\u2208Z\u226501 x\u2208Q0\n\nThe proof now follows.\n\n\u0003\n\n1\nFor every \u03bb \u2208 ZQ\n\u22650 , define\n\nf\u03bb : Rep(Q, 1) \u2192 k\nY\nt(a)\u03bb(a) .\n(t(a))a\u2208Q1 7\u2192\na\u2208Q1\n\nNow it is clear that {f\u03bb | \u03bb \u2208 I \u22121 (\u03c3)\n\nT\n\n1\nZQ\n\u22650 } is a k-basis of SI(Q, 1)\u03c3 .\n\nProposition 6.3. For every W \u2208 Rep(Q, 1), the semigroup S(W ) is saturated.\nProof. Write W = (t(a))a\u2208Q1 , where t(a) \u2208 k, \u2200a \u2208 Q1 . Note that for a weight \u03c3 \u2208 ZQ0 , we have\n\\\n1\n\u03c3 \u2208 S(W ) \u21d0\u21d2 \u2203\u03bb \u2208 I \u22121 (\u03c3) ZQ\n\u22650 such that \u03bb(a) = 0 whenever t(a) = 0.\n\nTo check that S(W ) is saturated, we can clearly assume that t(a) 6= 0, \u2200a \u2208 Q1 . Under this\nassumption, we deduce that S(W ) = \u03a3(Q, 1) which is known to be saturated by Theorem 2.5. \u0003\n\n\f15\n\nReferences\n[1] I. Assem, D. Simson, and A. Skowro\u0144ski.
