Many entanglement measures\nhave been proposed for the two-particle as well as for\nthe multiparticle case [1, 2]. Virtually all of the proposed entanglement measures, however, suffer a serious\ndrawback: They are very difficult to compute as their\ndefinition contains optimizations over certain states or\nquantum information protocols [3]. Such optimizations\ncan be performed successfully for special cases only, for\ninstance, if the density matrix under investigation possesses a high symmetry or belongs to a special family,\ne.g., with low rank [4].\nAn often-used entanglement measure for multiparticle\nsystems is the geometric measure of entanglement [5].\nFor a given multiparticle state |\u03c8i, one first considers the\nclosest fully separable state |\u03c6i = |ai|bi|ci * * * in terms of\nthe overlap\nG(\u03c8) =\n\nmax\n\n|\u03c6i=|ai|bi|ci***\n\n|h\u03c8|\u03c6i|,\n\n(1)\n\nand then defines the geometric measure of the pure state\nas\nEG (|\u03c8i) = 1 \u2212 G(\u03c8)2 .\n\n(2)\n\nSometimes, the geometric measure for pure states is also\ntaken as \u03b5G (|\u03c8i) = \u22122 log2 G(\u03c8). Based on this definition, the geometric measure is extended to mixed states\nvia the convex roof construction: For a given density matrix \u033a one minimizes over\nP all possible decompositions of\n\u033a into pure states \u033a = k pk |\u03c6k ih\u03c6k |, where the pk form\na probability distribution,\nX\nEG (\u033a) = min\npk EG (|\u03c6k i).\n(3)\npk ,|\u03c6k i\n\nk\n\nClearly, also this optimization is not straightforward to\ncompute.\n\nThe geometric measure has become one of the widely\nused entanglement measures for the multiparticle case.\nIt fulfills all the desired properties of an entanglement\nmonotone [5]. Moreover, it has a physical interpretation\nof quantifying the difficulty in distinguishing multiparticle quantum states by local means [6]. It has also been\nused to study quantum phase transitions in spin models [7, 8] and the usefulness of states as resources for measurement based quantum computation [9]. The value of\nEG has been computed for many pure states [10, 11, 12],\nand the convex roof for some important cases has been\ncalculated in Refs. [5, 13].\nIf one considers the optimization problem in Eq. (1),\na natural question arises whether for a symmetric state\n|\u03c8i the closest product state can be chosen symmetric,\ni.e., |\u03c6i = |ai|ai|ai * * * . If this is true, it drastically simplifies the calculation of the geometric measure for pure\nsymmetric states, as the number of parameters in this\noptimization then does not depend on the number of particles anymore. Recently this problem drew considerable\nattention in quantum information theory and some effort was made to prove it. For example, it has been\nused as a conjecture in Ref. [5]. In Ref. [11] it has been\nproved for two particles that there is always a symmetric\nstate which gives the maximum value (but it can happen that also non-symmetric states yield the same value)\nand a first attempt for the N -particle case was given.\nQuite recently, special cases of this conjecture have been\nverified [14], and related conjectures have been formulated [15].\nIn this paper, we investigate the conjecture from\nseveral perspectives. We show that a result on N homogeneous polynomials over Banach spaces can be applied to the above problem and proves that the maximum\nin Eq. (1) can be achieved by a symmetric state. However, this result does not allow to conclude that only symmetric solutions exist. We then go on to show that the\noptimal state maximizing G(\u03c8) is necessarily symmetric\nfor three or more particles. Finally, we will discuss con-\n\n\f2\nsequences and generalizations of our results, concerning,\namong others, the maximization of the expectation value\nof symmetric positive operators.\nII.\n\nIn order to prove Lemma 1, we will first consider the\nsituation where N = 2. The following Lemma and its\nproof were already given Ref. [11], however, the proof\nprovides some observations that are essential in order to\nestablish our main result.\n\nTHE MAIN RESULT\n\nIn this section we will first apply a result from the theory of homogeneous polynomials to the conjecture, proving that a symmetric state attains the maximum. Then\nwe proof a stronger version, stating that the maximizing\nstate is necessarily symmetric. Let us fix our notation.\nWe write the overlap with a product state as an evaluation of a corresponding N -linear form, i.e.,\nh\u03c8|\u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1N i =: \u03c8(\u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1N ).\n\n(4)\n\nA symmetric state |\u03c8i then corresponds to a symmetric\nN -linear form \u03c8. For a k-level system, the vectors \u03b1i\nare elements of Ck and we will always assume they are\nnormalized. Furthermore, the expression \u03b1 \u2261 \u03b2 denotes\nequality up to a phase, i.e., there is a phase \u03c6 such that\n\u03b1 = ei\u03c6 \u03b2.\nFor any symmetric N -linear form there exists an associated N -homogeneous polynomial \u03c8\u0302 [16] by virtue of\nthe mapping\n\u03c8\u0302 : \u03b1 7\u2192 \u03c8(\u03b1, . . . , \u03b1).\n\n(5)\n\nThe norm of this polynomial is defined by\nk\u03c8\u0302k = max|\u03c8\u0302(\u03b1)|.\n\u03b1\n\n(6)\n\nIn this context the quantity G(\u03c8) we introduced above\nis denoted by k\u03c8k.\nThe relation between the norms k\u03c8\u0302k and k\u03c8k is studied in the theory of polynomials over Banach spaces, cf.\nRef. [17]. For a Banach space E the polarization constant\nc(N, E) is the smallest positive number such that\nk\u03c8k \u2264 c(N, E)k\u03c8\u0302k\n\n(7)\n\nholds for every symmetric N -linear form \u03c8 over E.\nFor finite dimensional real and complex Hilbert spaces\nthis polarization constant is known to be 1, cf. Ref. [18,\n19]. An exhaustive discussion can be found in Ref. [17].\nIn our particular case E = Ck it follows that symmetric\nproduct states maximize the overlap with any symmetric\nstate, but leaves open if also non-symmetric states attain\nthe maximal value. This is in fact never the case for\nN \u2265 3, as we summarize in\n\nLemma 2 ([11]). For any symmetric two-linear form \u03c8\nover Ck we can find a vector \u03b1 such that\nG(\u03c8) = |\u03c8(\u03b1, \u03b1)|.\n\n(9)\n\nRephrasing the statement of the Lemma, when maximizing |\u03c8| for two particles, the maximum can by reached\nby a symmetric choice of vectors, although a solution\nmaximizing |\u03c8| is not necessarily symmetric.\nProof of Lemma 2. In a fixed orthonormal basis {bi } the\nsymmetric quadratic form \u03c8 is represented by a symmetric matrix \u03a8ij := \u03c8(bi , bj ). Then we have \u03c8(\u03b1, \u03b2) =\n\u03b1T \u03a8\u03b2, where on the right-hand side \u03b1 and \u03b2 are column\nvectors with coefficients in the basis {bi }. For a complex\nsymmetric matrix \u03a8 = \u03a8T Takagi's factorization theorem [20] states that \u03a8 can be written as\n\u03a8 = U T DU,\n\n(10)\n\nwith a unitary matrix U and a diagonal matrix D =\ndiag(r1 , . . . , rk ) where the non-negative values ri are in\ndecreasing order, r1 \u2265 r2 \u2265 * * * \u2265 rk \u2265 0. In this form,\na symmetric choice of \u03b1 and \u03b2 maximizing |\u03c8| becomes\nevident, namely \u03b1 \u2261 \u03b2 \u2261 U \u2020 e1 where e1 = (1, 0, . . . , 0)T .\nHence G(\u03c8) = r1 .\nLet us make some remarks on the remaining freedom\nin the choice of \u03b1 and \u03b2. First, we note that if r1 > r2\nthe only choice to reach the maximum r1 is the one given\nin the proof above. Hence for this case the maximizing\nsolution is unique (up to a phase) and symmetric.\nOtherwise, consider the case r1 = r2 = * * * =\nrd . We then say \u03c8 is degenerate and define R1 :=\nspanC ({e1 , . . . , ed }). If G(\u03c8) = |\u03c8(\u03b1, \u03b2)|, we can always\nwrite \u03b1 \u2261 U \u2020 e\u2217 and \u03b2 \u2261 U \u2020 e with some e \u2208 R1 , where\nthe vector e\u2217 \u2208 R1 denotes the vector obtained from e\nby complex conjugation in the given basis. The case that\ne \u2261 e\u2217 then corresponds to the symmetric solutions.\nThe symmetric maximizing solutions therefore correspond via U to real vectors in R1 (up to a phase), and\nhaving a non-symmetric solution \u03b1 6\u2261 \u03b2 of the maximization implies degeneracy. Moreover, in case of degeneracy\nwe find a continuum of inequivalent asymmetric as well\nas symmetric solutions. The following observation will\nbe needed in the main proof and expresses this fact.\n\nLemma 1. Let \u03c8 6= 0 be a symmetric N -linear form over\nCk with N \u2265 3 and let the vectors \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1N maximize\n|\u03c8|, i.e.,\n\nObservation 3. Given a symmetric two-linear form \u03c8\nwith\n\nG(\u03c8) = |\u03c8(\u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1N )|.\n\nG(\u03c8) = |\u03c8(\u03b1, \u03b2)|,\n\n(8)\n\nThen the vectors \u03b1k are equal up to a phase, in other\nwords, the span of \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1N is one-dimensional.\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03b2 6\u2261 \u03b1, we can always find two orthonormal vectors\n\u03b41 and \u03b42 , such that:\n\n\f3\n(i) \u03b41 and \u03b42 span the same space as \u03b1 and \u03b2, in particular \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 spanC ({\u03b41 , \u03b42 }).\n(ii) We have G(\u03c8) = |\u03c8(\u03b41 , \u03b41 )| = |\u03c8(\u03b42 , \u03b42 )| =\n|\u03c8(\u03b7, \u03b7)| = |\u03c8(\u03bc, \u03bc\u2032 )|, where\n\u221a\n\u03b7 := (\u03b41 + \u03b42 )/ 2,\n\u221a\n(12)\n\u03bc := (\u03b41 + i\u03b42 )/ 2,\n\u221a\n\u2032\n\u03bc := (\u03b41 \u2212 i\u03b42 )/ 2.\n(iii) The vectors \u03b41 , \u03b42 , \u03b7, \u03bc\u2032 do not equal \u03b1, even modulo\na phase.\nProof. Consider G(\u03c8) = |\u03c8(\u03b1, \u03b2)| = |\u03c8(U \u2020 e\u2217 , U \u2020 e)| with\nthe unitary matrix U from Takagi's factorization of \u03a8,\nwhere e 6\u2261 e\u2217 as \u03b2 6\u2261 \u03b1 by assumption. We can\nchoose two real orthonormal vectors f1 , f2 such that\nspanC ({f1 , f2 }) = spanC ({e, e\u2217 }). They can be obtained\nfrom the real and imaginary parts of e and e\u2217 [21]. Hence\n\u03b41 = U \u2020 f1 and \u03b42 = U \u2020 f2\n\n(13)\n\nis a valid choice of orthonormal vectors fulfilling (i), each\nproviding a symmetric maximization of |\u03c8|. The vectors\n\u03b41 , \u03b42 as well as the vectors \u03b7, \u03bc, \u03bc\u2032 derived from \u03b41 , \u03b42\nfulfill (ii) by construction, according to\u221athe observations\n\u2020\nabove\n\u221a and because \u03b7 = U (f\u2032 1 + f2 )/ 2, where (f1 +\nf2 )/ 2 \u2208 R1 (likewise for \u03bc, \u03bc ). Finally, we have enough\nfreedom to choose f1 , f2 to satisfy (iii).\nAfter these preliminaries, we are ready to prove\nLemma 1:\nProof of Lemma 1. The proof consists of two parts. In\nPart I we prove the case N = 3. In Part II we extend the\nresult to arbitrary N > 3.\nPart I. Assume a maximizing set of vectors {\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3}\nhas been found,\nG(\u03c8) = |\u03c8(\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3)|.\n\n(14)\n\nWe show that the assumption dim[spanC ({\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3})] 6= 1\nleads to \u03c8 = 0.\nWithout losing generality, we hence assume that \u03b3 6\u2261 \u03b2.\nThen we have a degenerate quadratic form \u03c8(\u03b1, *, **). Using Lemma 2 we obtain a symmetric maximizing solution \u03c3 6\u2261 \u03b1 (due to \u03b3 6\u2261 \u03b2, \u03c3 is not unique). Hence\nwe have G(\u03c8) = |\u03c8(\u03b1, \u03c3, \u03c3)|. From Observation 3, applied to the quadratic form \u03c8(*, **, \u03c3), we take the vectors\n\u03b41 , \u03b42 , \u03b7, \u03bc, \u03bc\u2032 with the properties as stated. With these\nvectors we define the 2 \u00d7 2-matrices A, B, N, M via\nAkl := \u03c8(\u03b41 , \u03b4k , \u03b4l ),\nBkl := \u03c8(\u03b42 , \u03b4k , \u03b4l ),\n\n\u221a\nNkl := \u03c8(\u03b7, \u03b4k , \u03b4l ) = (Akl + Bkl )/ 2,\n\u221a\nMkl := \u03c8(\u03bc, \u03b4k , \u03b4l ) = (Akl + iBkl )/ 2.\n\n(15)\n\nAs \u03c3, \u03b41 , \u03b42 , \u03b7, and \u03bc\u2032 are in spanC ({\u03b41 , \u03b42 }) the matrices A, B, N, M correspond to two-forms which assume the maximum r1 = G(\u03c8) on this span. Since\n\n\u03b41 , \u03b42 , \u03b7, \u03bc\u2032 6\u2261 \u03c3, the quadratic forms A, B, N, M are\ndegenerate with the value r1 . In terms of the Takagi factorization, we can write A = UAT DUA and B =\nUBT DUB , etc. with D = diag(r1 , r1 ). It follows that\nA\u2020 A = B \u2020 B = N \u2020 N = M \u2020 M = D2 , which implies\nA\u2020 B + B \u2020 A = i(A\u2020 B \u2212 B \u2020 A) = 0. Hence B \u2020 A = 0,\nwhich is only possible for \u03c8 = 0.\nPart II. The extension to the case N > 3 is proved\nas follows. If G(\u03c8) = |\u03c8(\u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1N )| we define a\nsymmetric 3-linear form by\n\u03c8k\u0302 := \u03c8(\u03b1\u03021 , \u03b1\u03022 , . . . , \u03b1\u0302k , . . . , \u03b1N )\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u03b1\u0302i denotes omission, i.e., \u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b1k are omitted.\nAs in Part 1, we have G(\u03c8) = |\u03c8k\u0302 (\u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b1k )| and thus\n\u03b11 \u2261 \u03b12 \u2261 \u03b1k for all k. Hence all vectors \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1N\nmust be the same up to a phase.\nLemma 1 is stated for N -linear forms over a complex\nvector space. If |\u03c8i is real, one can also consider the\nmaximization over real product vectors. In general this\nwill yield a different result than the complex case [22].\nSince the polarization constant is 1 also in the real case,\none can find a a symmetric state among the real product states which attains the maximum. In contrast to\nthe complex case, the maximizing state is, however, not\nnecessarily symmetric for three particles. A counterexample is |\u03c8i = (|001i + |010i + |100i \u2212 |111i)/2 where the\nmaximum of 1/2 is also attained by |\u03c6i = |001i.\nThe following Lemma provides an additional very simple proof that c(N, H) = 1 for N = 2l , and is based on a\nsymmetrization procedure.\nLemma 4. Let \u03c8 be a symmetric N -linear form with\nN = 2l and let the vectors \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1N maximize |\u03c8|.\nThen there exists a normalized vector \u03b6 in the span of\n\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1N such that\n|\u03c8(\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1N )| = |\u03c8(\u03b6, . . . , \u03b6)|.\n\n(17)\n\nThis statement holds for real and complex Hilbert spaces.\nProof. Let h*, **i denote the scalar product and we\ndefine the constant \u039b = \u03c8(\u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b13 , . . . ).\nThen\n\u03c8(*, \u03b12 , \u03b13 , . . . ) = \u039b h\u03b11 , *i and \u03c8(\u03b11 , * , \u03b13 , . . . ) =\n\u039b h\u03b12 , * i (cf. Eq. (6) in Ref. [5]). Using the symmetry\nand linearity of \u03c8 we arrive at\n\u03c8(*, \u03b21 , \u03b13 , . . . ) = \u039b h\u03b21 , * i\n\n(18)\n\n\u039b = \u03c8(\u03b21 , \u03b21 , \u03b13 , . . . ),\n\n(19)\n\nand hence\nwhere \u03b21 = (\u03b11 + \u03b12 )/||\u03b11 + \u03b12 ||. (If \u03b11 = \u2212\u03b12 , we set\n\u03b21 = \u03b11 and replace \u039b by \u2212\u039b.)\nWe now repeat this procedure, first yielding \u039b =\n\u03c8(\u03b21 , \u03b21 , \u03b23 , \u03b23 , . . . ) and then \u039b = \u03c8(\u03b31 , \u03b31 , \u03b31 , \u03b31 , . . . ),\nwhere \u03b23 is defined analogously to \u03b21 and \u03b31 = (\u03b21 +\n\u03b23 )/||\u03b21 + \u03b23 ||. In the second step we applied the symmetrization to the first and third argument as well as\nto the second and fourth argument. Since N = 2l ,\nwe can complete this symmetrization and arrive at \u039b =\n\u03c8(\u03b6, . . . , \u03b6) for some \u03b6 in the span of \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1N .\n\n\f4\nIII.\nA.\n\nbe handled with care. For some models, it seems to be\ntrue [8, 24], for other models (like the Majumdar-Ghosh\nmodel [25]) one can directly check that it is wrong.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nPhysical interpretation of the proof\n\nAn interpretation of the proof of Lemma 1 in physical\nterms is the following. The matrices A, B, N and M in\nEq. (15) are representations of the state |\u03c8i, after one site\nhas been measured out and the remaining state has been\nprojected onto a two-dimensional subspace. The values\nri correspond to Schmidt coefficients of this remaining\nstate and, as they are equal, the state corresponds to a\nBell state. The proof of Lemma 1 shows that for qubits\nit is impossible to create a state of three particles that\nis both symmetric and always results in a Bell-pair like\nstate after an arbitrary measurement on one site.\n\nC.\n\nOperators of higher rank\n\nWe now consider generalizations of our results. Let\n\u03a0S be the projector onto the symmetric subspace S. An\noperator A is permutationally symmetric if it acts on the\nsymmetric subspace only, i.e., it fulfills A = \u03a0S A\u03a0S .\nA is called permutationally invariant if it is invariant\nunder permutation of the particles (the latter is a weaker\ncondition than the former [26]). We hence define for an\nobservable X\n\u011c(X) :=\n\nB.\n\nTranslationally invariant states\n\n\u011cS (X) :=\n\nIt is interesting to ask whether also for translationally\ninvariant states the maximum is attained in a symmetric\nstate, as such states occur naturally in the analysis of\nspin models. This has sometimes been assumed when\ninvestigating the geometric measure in condensed matter\nsystems.\nFirst, a counterexample for this conjecture is the state\n1\n|\u03c8i = \u221a (|0101i + |1010i)\n2\n\n(20)\n\nfor which the closest separable states are the nonsymmetric states |0101i and |1010i. In fact, one can\nfind translationally invariant states which are orthogonal to any symmetric product state, e.g., |\u03c8i \u223c (|0101i \u2212\n|0011i + all translations).\nThis situation gets worse as the number of particles\nincreases. Let T denote the subspace of translationally\ninvariant states for N qukits and let S \u2282 T be the permutationally symmetric subspace. Then any state in\nX = T \u2229 S \u22a5 \u2013 the orthocomplement of S in T \u2013 has\na vanishing overlap with any symmetric product state,\nhence the closest product state is not symmetric. The\ndimension of T is given by [23]\n1 X\ndim(T ) =\n\u03c6(j) k N/j ,\n(21)\nN\nj|N\n\nwhere \u03c6 denotes Euler's totient function and the summation is over all divisors j of N . For S we have\n\u0013\n\u0012\nN +k\u22121\n.\n(22)\ndim(S) =\nk\u22121\nTherefore, if N \u226b k then the dimension of the subspace\nX is roughly given by (k N \u2212 N k )/N and the fraction of\nstates where the conjecture holds shrinks rapidly as the\nnumber of particles increases.\nConcerning the analysis of entanglement in spin models, this shows that the assumption that the closest separable state to the ground state is symmetric, has to\n\nmax\n\n|\u03c6i=|ai|bi|ci***\n\nmax\n\n|\u03c6i=|ai***|ai\n\n|h\u03c6|X|\u03c6i|\n\n|h\u03c6|X|\u03c6i|\n\n(23)\n\nSuch optimizations occur naturally in the construction of\nentanglement witnesses or in the estimation of entanglement measures via Legendre transforms [2].\nTo study the relation of these quantities, we can write\nh\u03c6|X|\u03c6i = Tr [X |\u03c6ih\u03c6|] as an evaluation of a corresponding N -linear form \u03be over Hk (the Banach space of Hermitian matrices of dimension k equipped with the trace\nnorm) due to\n\u03be(A1 , . . . , AN ) = Tr [XA1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 AN ] .\n\n(24)\n\nThen any permutationally invariant operator X corresponds to a symmetric N -linear form \u03be and an N \u02c6 We now define k\u03bek and\nhomogeneous polynomial \u03be.\n\u02c6\nk\u03bek analogously to Section II (using kAk = 1 as normalization condition). It is straightforward to see that\n\u02c6\n\u011c(X) = k\u03bek and \u011cS (X) = k\u03bek.\nAs the polarization\nconstant can be shown to be [27]\nc(N, Hk ) = N N /N ! for N \u2264 k,\n\n(25)\n\nthe quotient \u011c(X)/\u011cS (X) can get arbitrarily large as N\nand k increase.\nAt the end of this section, we will provide a further\nexplicit example. Let us first discuss some cases where\nsymmetry assumptions do hold:\nCorollary 5. (i) If X is a positive permutationally symmetric observable then \u011c(X) can be attained by a symmetric state.\n(ii) If X is a permutationally invariant N -qubit observable that contains only full correlation terms, then \u011c(X)\ncan be attained by a symmetric state.\nProof. (i) We note that\n\u011c(X) \u2264\n\nmax\n\nmax\n\n|\u03c8i=|b1 i***|bn i |\u03c6i=|a1 i***|an i\n\n|h\u03c6|X|\u03c8i|.\n\n(26)\n\nFixing |\u03c8i, the (unnormalized) state X|\u03c8i = \u03a0S X\u03a0S |\u03c8i\nis symmetric and by virtue of Lemma 1 the maximum\n\n\f5\nis reached by a symmetric state |a, . . . , ai. Repeating the reasoning with the fixed state |\u03c6i = |a, . . . , ai,\nwe get \u011c(X) \u2264 max|bi max|ai |ha, . . . , a|X|b, . . . , bi|. The\nfact that for positive operators 2|h\u03b1|P |\u03b2i| \u2264 h\u03b1|P |\u03b1i +\nh\u03b2|P |\u03b2i \u2264 2 max{h\u03b1|P |\u03b1i, h\u03b2|P |\u03b2i} holds for arbitrary\n|\u03b1i and |\u03b2i proves that \u011c(X) \u2264 \u011cS (X), hence \u011c(X) =\n\u011cS (X).\n(ii) An N -qubit P\noperator X contains only full correlation terms if X = i,j,...\u2208{x,y,z} \u03bbij*** \u03c3i \u2297 \u03c3j \u2297 * * * . Note\nthat here \u03c30 = 1 does not occur; a physically relevant and\nwell known example for such an operator X is the Mermin\ninequality. As X is permutationally invariant, \u03bb is equivalent to a symmetric N -linear form over R3 . The Bloch\nrepresentation for qubits implies that here the maximization is equivalent to finding maxri \u2208R3 |\u03bb(r1 , r2 , . . . , rN )|\nwhere the vectors ri are the corresponding Bloch vectors.\nSince the polarization constant for real Hilbert spaces is\n1 [17, 18, 19], the assertion follows.\nLet us conclude with some examples where symmetry\nassumptions do not hold. If X is symmetric but not\npositive, then the maximum \u011c(X) is, in general, not\nattained by a symmetric state. A counterexample for\ntwo qubits is X = 6 |\u03c8\u221a+ ih\u03c8 + | \u2212 |00ih00| \u2212 2 |11ih11| with\n|\u03c8 + i = (|01i + |10i)/ 2. Then \u011c(X) = 3 (we can take\n|\u03c60 i = |01i) while the maximum for symmetric product states is 34/15. Also, if X is permutationally invariant (and even positive) then the maximum \u011c(X)\nis, in general, not attained by a symmetric state. A\ncounterexample is the\nsinglet state, X = |\u03c8 \u2212 ih\u03c8 \u2212 | with\n\u221a\n|\u03c8 \u2212 i = (|01i\u2212 |10i)/ 2. This operator is invariant under\npermutation of the particles, but it does not act on the\n\n[1] M. Plenio and S. Virmani, Quant. Inf. Comp. 7, 1 (2007);\nR. Horodecki et al., Rev. Mod.

[15].\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion, we have discussed a widely used conjecture concerning the geometric measure of entanglement. Our results not only simplify the calculation of\nthe geometric measure for symmetric states, but they\nalso have applications to subjects in condensed matter\nphysics. Furthermore, from a mathematical perspective,\nthe quantity G, as defined in the introduction, is known\nas the injective tensor norm [28]. On the one hand, this\nnorm is of central importance in tensor analysis, since\nthere are, as Grothendieck showed, fourteen inequivalent\nnatural tensor norms derivable from G [29]. On the other\nhand, this norm has also occurred in the discussion of the\nmaximal output purity of quantum channels [30]. So we\nbelieve that the study of tensor norms can yield further\ninteresting insights in quantum information theory.\nWe thank A. Abdesselam, A. Harrow, M. Murao, R. Orus, D.
