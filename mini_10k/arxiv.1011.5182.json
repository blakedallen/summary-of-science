Introduction\nThe theory of holonomies and geometric phases associated with evolutions of a quantum\nsystem is by now a well developed subject. The initial work by Berry [1] on the\nAbelian geometric phase of adiabatic evolutions of non-degenerate states has been\nextended in many directions, to include non-adiabatic evolutions [2] as well as nonAbelian holonomies of sets of degenerate states [3, 4], and to mixed states [5]. It was\nsubsequently discovered that the quantum geometric phase had an early counterpart\nin the geometric phase discovered by Pancharatnam in the context of classical optics\n[6, 7, 8]. The Pancharatnam construction has been generalized to the non-Abelian case\nby utilizing subspaces [9, 10, 11, 12]. More recently holonomies that bear a relation to\ncorrelations have been constructed in the context of multipartite and lattice systems\n[13, 14, 15, 16].\nThe idea of this paper is to develop the concept of geometric phases in another\ndirection and use two-particle interferometry to construct correlation induced nonAbelian holonomies in a way that does not depend on degeneracy, but on the ability to\ndivide the system into spatially separated subsystems. Instead of considering parallel\ntransport of subspaces, we consider the natural tensor product structure of a bipartite\nstate, induced by the spatial separation of the two subsystems, and local unitary\noperations to define the parallel transport.\nThe parallel transport condition to be introduced is similar to that of the\nPancharatnam construction [6, 7, 8], in which two states | Ai and | Bi of a quantum\nsystem are defined to be in-phase if their scalar product hB | Ai is a positive number.\nThis condition can be implemented in a Mach-Zehnder interferometric setup, where the\nspatial state of the system prior to the last beam splitter is a coherent superposition of\nthe two paths [17, 18]. If we let | Ai and | Bi be the internal states corresponding to\nthe output of respective paths of the interferometer, then Pancharatnam parallelity is\nachieved by shifting a U(1) phase in one of the paths, such that the interference intensity\nis maximal.\nIn two-particle interferometry [19, 20, 21] the spatial state of the two-particle\nsystem is a coherent superposition of two distinct pairs of correlated paths for the two\nsubsystems. In the same spirit as Pancharatnam we use a two-particle interferometric\nintensity, namely the coincidence intensity in a Franson interferometer [20, 21, 22], to\ndefine an \"in-phase\" condition and the corresponding parallel transport. An arbitrary\nunitary operation is performed in one of the arms of the interferometer on the first\nsubsystem, thus making the outputs of the two possible pairs of paths different.\nSubsequently, another unitary operation is performed in the other arm on the second\nsubsystem, and is chosen such as to achieve maximal coincidence intensity. This second\nunitary is considered to be the \"phase\" degree of freedom of the system and at maximal\nintensity the two outputs are considered to be \"in-phase\", or \"parallel\". Thus we\nconsider the orbit space formed by the state space of the system modulo this unitary\ndegree of freedom on the second subsystem to be the space in which the system is\n\n\fCorrelation induced non-Abelian quantum holonomies\n\n3\n\nparallel transported.\nIn the special case of pure two-qubit states, and evolutions generated by local\nSU(2) operations, the state space naturally fibrates through the second Hopf fibration\nand the orbit space of the two qubit-states can be mapped to the state space of a\nquaternionic qubit [23]. The coincidence intensity of the Franson interferometer, in\nthis case, corresponds to the quaternionic quantum mechanics analogue of the MachZehnder intensity and the associated parallel transport condition corresponds to the\nL\u00e9vay connection [24] restricted to local SU(2) evolutions.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. It turns out that the Stokes tensor formalism\n[25] is convenient for our analysis. Therefore we briefly review this representation\nin section 2. Section 3 contains a description of the Franson interferometric setup\nand we define the parallelity condition in this setting. In section 4, we describe the\nparallel transport procedure, discuss the properties of the related holonomy group and\nintroduce the corresponding connection form. Finally, in section 5 we consider the\nparallel transport scheme in the special case of pure two-qubit states, and evolutions\ngenerated by SU(2) operations and its relation to the quaternionic representation of\npure two-qubit states and the corresponding L\u00e9vay connection. The paper ends with\nthe conclusions.\n2. Stokes tensor formalism\nIn the Stokes tensor formalism [25], single particle quantum states are represented as\nreal vectors and N-partite states are represented as real N-tensors. A multi-partite\nsystem consisting of parts A, B, . . . Z, where part K has dimension DK , is represented\n2\nas a DA2 \u00d7 DB\n\u00d7 . . . \u00d7 DZ2 -dimensional tensor SjA jB ...jZ .

In the following, we shall in most cases use\nthe simplifying notation \u03c7\u0302K\nThe Hermitean,\nj for the generators on subsystem K.\nD 2 \u22121\n\nK\nof U(DK ) satisfy orthogonality\ntraceless and linearly independent generators {\u03c7K\nj }j=1\n2\nP\nDK \u22121\n4\nK\nK\nK\nK\nK\nK K\nTr(\u03c7\u0302j \u03c7\u0302k ) = 2\u03b4jk , and [\u03c7\u0302k , \u03c7\u0302l ] = 2i m=1 fklm \u03c7\u0302m as well as {\u03c7\u0302K\nk , \u03c7\u0302l } = DK \u03b4kl 1\u0302 +\nPDK2 \u22121\n2 n=1\ndkln \u03c7\u0302K\nn , where djkl and fjkl are the symmetric and antisymmetric structure\nconstants, respectively, of U(DK ).

The zeroth row and zeroth\ncolumn of the tensor, with elements S0j and Sj0 respectively, are the Stokes 1-tensors\ncorresponding to the reduced states of subsystem A and B, and these contain all the\nlocal information of the bipartite system. The remaining part, formed by the elements\nSij , i, j > 0, contains all the correlations of the state and this subtensor, the correlation\nmatrix, is denoted by Mij . This matrix has previously been used to study correlations\nand separability in quantum systems [26, 27].\nA unitary transformation on subsystem A transforms the reduced density\nmatrix as \u00db \u03c1\u0302A \u00db \u2020 . This corresponds to a transformation RS, on S where Rjk =\n1\n\u2020 A\nTr(\u00db \u03c7\u0302A\nk \u00db \u03c7\u0302j ). The R matrix is an orthogonal matrix, as can be seen\n((DA \u22122)\u03b4j0 +2)\nby observing that\n1\n1\nA\n\u2020\nA \u2020\nTr(\u03c7\u0302A\nTr(\u00db \u03c7\u0302A\n\u03b4jk=\nj \u03c7\u0302k ) =\nj \u00db \u00db \u03c7\u0302k \u00db ) =\n[(DA \u22122)\u03b4j0 +2]\n[(DA \u22122)\u03b4j0 +2]\nD 2 \u22121\n\nD 2 \u22121\n\nA\nA\nX\nX\n1\nT\n\u2020\nA \u2020\nRjl\nRlk .\n(U\u03c7A\nU\n)\n(U\u03c7\nU\n)\n=\n=\nl\nl\nj\nk\n[(DA \u22122)\u03b4k0 +2][(DA \u22122)\u03b4j0 +2] l=0\nl=0\n\n(5)\n\nSimilarly a unitary transformation on subsystem B corresponds to an orthogonal matrix\nacting on S from the right. It should be noted that the M matrix transforms under local\nunitary operations on subsystem A and B through left and right action, respectively,\nby orthogonal matrices.\nAs an example of how the M matrix behaves we can consider a pure two-qubit\nstate in the Schmidt basis\n| \u03c8i = a | 00i + b | 11i\n\n(6)\n\nwhere a and b are real non-negative numbers and a2 + b2 = 1. Expressed in the\n\u0001\nSchmidt basis, the correlation matrix with elements Mjk = Tr \u03c1\u0302\u03c3\u0302jA \u2297 \u03c3\u0302kB , \u03c3jA and \u03c3kB ,\n\n\fCorrelation induced non-Abelian quantum holonomies\n\n5\n\nj, k = 1, 2, 3, being the standard Pauli operators on subsystem A and B, respectively,\nreads\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nC 0 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nM = \uf8ed 0 \u2212C 0 \uf8f8 ,\n(7)\n0 0 1\n\nwhere C = 2ab is the pure state concurrence [28]. Here it is clearly seen that M is\nrank one for product states. It must be emphasized that M11 = \u2212M22 = C because\nwe choose a, b \u2208 R. The elements of M are not explicit functions of concurrence\nfor arbitrary complex coefficients a, b. However, since all pure two-qubit states with\nthe same concurrence can be related by local unitaries, corresponding to orthogonal\ntransformations acting from the right and the left on M, the absolute value of the\ndeterminant of M\n| det M |= C 2\n\n(8)\n\nis invariant under local unitary transformations and measures concurrence. For\nmaximally entangled states we thus have that |det M|= 1.\nWhen we consider mixed states there can be correlations also in separable states. As\nan example of how the M matrix registers correlation for mixed states we can consider\nthe Werner states [29]\n(1 \u2212 p) A\n1\u0302 \u2297 1\u0302B ,\n(9)\n4\nwhere |\u03c8i is some maximally entangled state and p \u2208 [0, 1]. The absolute value of the\n3\ndeterminant\nh is | deti M |= p , which can be compared to the square of the concurrence\n, 0 . Thus for p \u2264 13 the determinant of M is nonzero even though the\nC = max (3p\u22121)\n2\nstate is separable. This underscores that the M matrix for mixed states is sensitive to\ncorrelations in general.\n\u03c1\u0302W = p | \u03c8ih\u03c8 | +\n\n3. Parallel transport condition\n3.1. Interferometric setup and parallelity\nA Franson interferometer [20, 21, 22],is a two-particle device composed of two identical\nunbalanced two-path interferometers, so-called Franson loops, as shown in Fig. 1. The\ntwo parts of the bipartite state are emitted, one into each Franson loop. A beam splitter\ndivides each path in two different paths of unequal length, which later converge at a\nsecond beam splitter. The difference in path length between the two arms in each\nFranson loop is chosen to be the same, and such that the difference in transit time \u2206t\nis greater than the single particle coherence time. The transit time difference between\nthe paths must be smaller than the coherence time of the bipartite state to allow twoparticle interference. Of importance is that the emitter is such that is impossible to\ndefine a time of emission. Detectors are placed after the convergence of the two paths\nin each Franson loop and coincidence measurements are made.\n\n\fCorrelation induced non-Abelian quantum holonomies\n\n6\n\nFigure 1.

Unitary operations on the internal\ndegrees of freedom the particle are performed in the long arms of each Franson loop.\n\nSince we discard non-coincidental detections, corresponding to the bipartite system\ntraversing a long path in one of the Franson loops and a short path in the other, it is\nnecessary that the time resolution of the detectors is smaller than \u2206t. Furthermore, due\nto the requirement that time of emission cannot be defined, and since no measurements\nare made inside the Franson loops, it cannot be ascribed to a coincidence detection\nevent that the bipartite system traversed either the two short paths or the two long\nones. Hence the system is in a coherent superposition of having traversed the two\nlong arms, and having traversed the two short arms. In the long paths of each subinterferometer we place devices that perform unitary operations on the internal state\nof the bipartite state. After the point of convergence of the two paths, the effective\nunnormalized internal state is under the above requirements therefore\n1\n\u03c1\u0302 = (1\u0302 + \u00db \u2297 V\u0302 )\u03c1\u03020 (1\u0302 + \u00db \u2020 \u2297 V\u0302 \u2020 ),\n4\n\n(10)\n\nPDA2 \u22121\nPDB2 \u22121\nB\nwhere \u03c1\u03020 is the initial internal state.

We ask, given that a specific\nunitary operation \u00db \u2208 U(DA ) has been chosen in the first Franson loop, what unitary\noperation V\u0302 \u2208 U(DB ) should be chosen in the second Franson loop in order to maximize\nthe coincidence intensity? We take maximal coincidence intensity as the definition of\nparallelity between the output of the two short paths and the output of the two long\npaths. This maximization procedure is the analogue of the procedure used to define\nPancharatnam parallelity in the context of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer [17, 18], but\nhere the Franson coincidence intensity has taken the role of the Mach-Zehnder intensity\nand V\u0302 has taken the role of the U(1) phase factor. It should be noted that if S does not\nPDA2 \u22121\nUk Skj = 0 for all j. In this case the\nhave full rank, then there exist \u00db such that k=0\nPDA2 \u22121\ninterference term is identically zero for all V\u0302 , but if k=0\nUk Skj 6= 0 there will always\nbe a V\u0302 corresponding to maximal intensity.\nTo find a formal expression for the operator V\u0302 that maximizes the intensity, we seek\nto maximize I AB in equation (12) with respect to the coefficients Vk , using Lagrange's\nPDB2 \u22121\n|\nmethod.

The explicit form of the Lagrange parameters, and thus B \u22121 , is\nfound by solving for the unitarity constraints on V\u0302 . The solutions of these constraint\nequations give us the critical points of the intensity as a function of \u00db. We can see from\nthe constraints that for each solution \u03bb, \u03bc\u0304 there is a solution \u2212\u03bb, \u2212\u03bc\u0304 and if one of them\ncorresponds to a local maximum, the other corresponds to a local minimum. There\nwill be a unique solution to the maximization problem if and only if there is a unique\nglobal maximum of the intensity as a function of \u00db, corresponding to a combination of\nparameters \u03bb, \u03bc\u0304 satisfying the constraints.\nIn the general case, finding this solution as a function of \u00db appears to be a nontrivial problem. For product states, however, the unitary V\u0302 that maximizes the intensity\nis easily found and is always a Abelian U(1) phase factor. This can be seen by observing\nthat for product states \u03c1A \u2297\u03c1B the coincidence intensity is\n1 1\n(18)\nI AB = + Re Tr(\u00db \u03c1\u0302A ) Tr(V\u0302 \u03c1\u0302B ).\n2 2\nA\n\nand therefore the V\u0302 that maximizes this expression is found to be V\u0302 = e\u2212i arg(Tr(\u00db \u03c1\u0302 )) 1\u0302.\nWe may note that for the trivial case where \u00db = ei\u03c6 1\u0302, we see that the intensity is\nmaximal if and only if V\u0302 = e\u2212i\u03c6 1\u0302, regardless of the state of the bipartite system.\n3.2. Example I: Qudit-qubit\nIn section 3.1, the solution V\u0302 \u2208 U(DB ) to the maximization problem is not given\non a closed form and it is not apparent how to find it. However, for the case\nwhere the second subsystem is a qubit, and therefore V\u0302 \u2208 U(2), the B matrix is\nP\nBkl = \u03bb\u03b4lk + 3j=1 \u03bcj [(\u03b4jk \u03b4l0 + \u03b4jl \u03b4k0 ) \u2212 ifjkl ]. It can be seen that B now separates as\n1\nB = \u03bb1\u0302 + H, where H is Hermitean and H 2 \u221d 1\u0302, and therefore B \u22121 = \u221adet\n(\u2212\u03bb1\u0302 + H).\nB\n\n\fCorrelation induced non-Abelian quantum holonomies\n\n9\n\nExplicitly\n\uf8eb\n\n\u2212\u03bb \u03bc1\n\u03bc2\n\u03bc3\n\uf8ec\n1\n\uf8ec \u03bc1 \u2212\u03bb \u2212i\u03bc3 i\u03bc2\nB \u22121 = \u221a\n\uf8ec\n\u2212\u03bb \u2212i\u03bc1\ndet B \uf8ed \u03bc2 i\u03bc3\n\u03bc3 \u2212i\u03bc2 i\u03bc1\n\u2212\u03bb\n\u0001\n2\ndet B = \u2212\u03bb2 + \u03bc\u0304 * \u03bc\u0304 .\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f8\n\n(19)\n\nWhile it is still not obvious how to find the Lagrange parameters in general we may\nsolve it in some special cases. To illustrate this, let us consider a \u00db that has the form\n\u00db = U1 \u03c3\u03021 + U2 \u03c3\u03022 , where \u03c3\u03021 and \u03c3\u03022 are the standard Pauli operators, and a pure state\n| \u03c8i = a | 00i + b | 11i,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere a, b \u2265 0. As a consequence of our choice of basis S10 = S20 = 0 and the\nconcurrence C = 2ab. This together with our special choice of \u00db, implies that the\nintensity is\n1 C\n(21)\nI AB = + Re(V1 U1 \u2212 V2 U2 ).\n2\n2\nUsing equations (17) and (19), and the constraints, we find that \u03bc\u0304 = 0, \u03bb = \u00b1C, where\nthe positive sign corresponds to the global maximum while the negative sign corresponds\nto the global minimum. The unitary operator V\u0302 corresponding to the maximum is\nV\u0302 = U1\u2217 \u03c3\u03021 \u2212 U2\u2217 \u03c3\u03022 ,\nand the maximal intensity is\n1\nAB\nImax\n= (1 + C).\n2\n\n(22)\n\n(23)\n\n3.3. Example II: Restriction to SU(D)\nA variation of the maximization procedure is to restrict the set from which \u00db and\nV\u0302 can be chosen. One natural restriction would be to consider only SU(DA ) and\nSU(DB ) operations in the Franson loops. When this restriction is made the qualitative\nproperties of the parallel transport may change. It is for example no longer obvious that\nthe unitaries V\u0302 associated to a product state, will be a commuting set in the general\ncase. The restriction where the second subsystem is a qubit and therefore V\u0302 \u2208 SU(2),\nhowever, leads to a significant simplification of the maximization problem. Here, we\nsolve this problem and in particular show that product states are indeed associated\nwith commuting sets of unitaries.\nSince SU(2) can be parametrized by four real numbers subject to only one\nconstraint, the solution of the maximization problem can be found easily for arbitrary\nstates and arbitrary \u00db \u2208 SU(DA ). We choose the parametrization of V\u0302 such that V0 is\nreal and iV1 , iV2 , iV3 are purely imaginary. The intensity in this parametrization is\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee 2\n2 \u22121\nDA\nDA \u22121\n3\nX\nX\nX\n1 1\nVk (Uj \u2212 Uj\u2217 )Sjk \uf8fb\n(24)\nV0 (Uj + Uj\u2217 )Sj0 + i\nI AB = + \uf8f0\n2 4 j=0\nj=0 k=1\n\n\fCorrelation induced non-Abelian quantum holonomies\n\n10\n\nand V\u0302 is found to be\nV\u0302 =\n\n\uf8ee\n\n2 \u22121\nDA\n\n1 \uf8f0\n2\u03bb\n\nX\n\n(Uj + Uj\u2217 )Sj0 1\u0302B + i\n\nj=0\n\n2 \u22121\nDA\n\n3\nX X\nj=0 k=1\n\n\uf8f9\n\n(Uj \u2212 Uj\u2217 )Sjk \u03c3\u0302kB \uf8fb ,\n\n(25)\n\nB\nwhere \u03c3\u0302m\nare the Pauli operators.

Hence for product states\n2\u03bb\nthe unitary V\u0302 that maximizes intensity commutes with \u03c1\u0302B for any \u00db. Therefore the\nset of unitaries V\u0302 associated to a product state commute with the density operator and\nwith each other. The signature of a product state is thus that the corresponding set of\nunitaries will be commuting when the unitary operators on the second subsystem are\nrestricted to SU(2).\n3.4. Example III: SO(D) and two-redit states\nAnother variation of of our procedure is to maximize the intensity for V\u0302 \u2208 SO(DB ) given\n\u00db \u2208 SO(DA ) in the other Franson loop. Since SO(D) is the endomorphism group of the\nD-dimensional redit state space we may consider this restriction of the maximization\nprocedure when the state space is restricted to a two-redit subspace. For two redits the\nstate \u03c1\u0302 naturally decomposes as\n2\n\n2\n\nDA \u22121DB \u22121\nX X sym\n1\nanti\u2212sym \u0001 A\n\u03c7\u0302k \u2297 \u03c7\u0302B\nSkl + Skl\n\u03c1\u0302 =\nl ,\n[\u03b4k0 (DA \u22122)+2][\u03b4l0 (DB \u22122)+2] k=0 l=0\n\n(27)\n\nsym\nanti\u2212sym\nB\nwhere Skl\nis nonzero only when \u03c7\u0302A\nis\nk and \u03c7\u0302l are both symmetric, and Skl\nA\nB\nnonzero only when \u03c7\u0302k and \u03c7\u0302l are both antisymmetric. The generators of the subgroup\nSO(D) \u2282 SU(D) are the antisymmetric generators of SU(D). As a special case we\ncan consider a general mixed two-rebit state, where the only pair of antisymmetric\ngenerators spanning the state space is \u03c3\u03022A \u2297 \u03c3\u03022B . Since SO(2) operators can be expanded\nin a basis consisting of only 1\u0302 and \u03c3\u03022 , the intensity is\n1\n1 1\n(28)\nI AB = + U0 V0 \u2212 V2 U2 M22 ,\n2 2\n2\nwhere U0 , V0 , U2 , V2 \u2208 R and M22 = CR = Tr(\u03c3\u03022A \u2297 \u03c3\u03022B \u03c1\u0302) is the rebit concurrence [30].\nThe SO(2) operator that maximizes the intensity is\n\u0001\n1\nU0 1\u0302B \u2212 iCR U2 \u03c3\u03022B ,\n(29)\nV\u0302 =\n\u03bb\n\n\fCorrelation induced non-Abelian quantum holonomies\n11\np\nwhere \u03bb = | U0 |2 +CR2 | U2 |2 . We note that for product two-rebit states V\u0302 can only be\n1\u0302 or \u22121\u0302.\n4. Correlation induced non-Abelian quantum holonomy\nIn this section we use the parallelity condition introduced in section 3.1 to define\na procedure for parallel transport of a bipartite quantum state. We consider the\ninfinitesimal limit to find a connection form corresponding to this parallel transort.\nBy definition the output of the long arms is parallel with the output of the short arms\nwhen V\u0302 is chosen such as to maximize the coincidence intensity. Now we choose to view\nthe output of the long arms as the parallel transported version of the output of the\nshort arms. By using that output state as input for another Franson setup, where in a\nsimilar way a new output state is created, we can parallel transport the state through\nan arbitrary number of steps.\nTo see how this works we let \u03c1\u0302(0) be the input state of the interferometer. The\noutput state of the long arms is \u03c1\u0302(1) = \u00db (1) \u2297 V (1) \u03c1\u0302(0) \u00db (1)\u2020 \u2297 V (1)\u2020 , where \u00db (1) \u2208 U(DA )\nand V\u0302 (1) \u2208 U(DB ) are unitary operators that has been applied such as to implement\nparallelity. In the second step, we use \u03c1\u0302(1) as the input in a new Franson interferometer,\nwhere a new unitary \u00db (2) is chosen and a new V\u0302 (2) is found to create an output of the\nlong arms \u03c1\u0302(2) that is parallel to \u03c1\u0302(1) .\nThe parallel transport is performed by iterating the intensity maximizing procedure\nin this way as illustrated in Fig. 2. In the nth step, a \u00db (n) \u2208 U(DA ) is chosen, and\nthereafter a V\u0302 (n) \u2208 U(DB ) is found that maximizes the intensity. After V\u0302 (n) has been\nfound the input state for the next step is taken to be \u03c1\u0302(n) = (\u00db (n) \u2297 V\u0302 (n) )\u03c1\u0302(n\u22121) (\u00db (n)\u2020 \u2297\nV\u0302 (n)\u2020 ).\nThe coincidence intensity in the (n + 1)th step is now\nI\n\n(n+1)\n\nh\ni\n1 1\n(n+1)\n(n+1)\n(0)\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2297 V\u0302\n)(\u00db(n)\u2297 V\u0302 (n))\u03c1\u0302 (\u00db (n) \u2297 V\u0302 (n) ) ,\n= + Re Tr (\u00db\n2 2\n(30)\n\nwhere the cumulated unitary operations that are applied to the original input state\n\u03c1\u0302(0) at the beginning of the (n + 1)th step are \u00db (n) \u2261 \u00db (n) \u00db (n\u22121) . . . \u00db (1) and V\u0302 (n) \u2261\nV\u0302 (n) V\u0302 (n\u22121) . . .

Relation to L\u00e9vay parallel transport for SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2)\n\nThe pure two-qubit states can be represented as quaternionic qubit states [23, 24] using\nthe structure of the second Hopf-fibration. Within this representation one can construct\nthe quaternionic analogue of the Pancharatnam geometric phase, as has been done by\nL\u00e9vay [24]. We review this quaternionic representation and show that when the state\nevolution is generated by local SU(2) operators, the L\u00e9vay geometric phase is contained\nin our construction.\nIn the quaternionic representation a pure two-qubit state\n| \u03c8i = \u03b1 | 00i + \u03b2 | 01i + \u03b3 | 10i + \u03b4 | 11i,\n\n(43)\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4 \u2208 C, is associated with a quaternionic qubit state\n| \u03a8i = (\u03b1 + \u03b2j) | 0i + (\u03b3 + \u03b4j) | 1i.\n\n(44)\n\n\fCorrelation induced non-Abelian quantum holonomies\n\n15\n\nHere the quaternionic state | 0i is formed by identifying | 00i and | 01i in such a\nway that the complex coefficients of these states are contained in the new quaterionic\ncoefficient, and similarly for | 1i. The standard quaternion basis elements i, j and k,\nsatisfy i2 = j2 = k2 = \u22121 and ij = \u2212ji = k. A local SU(2) unitary \u00db acting on the\nfirst qubit is represented by a operator \u00db acting from the left on | \u03a8i and a local SU(2)\nunitary V\u0302 acting on the second qubit is represented by a unit quaternion qV acting from\nthe right\n| \u03a8i = \u00db | \u03a80 iq\u0302V ,\n(45)\nP3\nwhere \u00db = U0 1\u0302 + i j=1 Uj \u03c3\u0302 j with 1\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 1 , \u03c3\u03022 , \u03c3\u0302 3 the standard unit and Pauli\noperators acting on the quaternionic qubit Hilbert space. The unit quaternion q\u0302V \u2208\nSp(1) corresponds to V\u0302 according to\nB\n\nV\u0302 = V0 1\u0302 + i\n\n3\nX\n\nVj \u03c3\u0302jB\n\nj=1\n\nl\n\nq\u0302V = V0 + V3 i \u2212 V2 j + V1 k,\n\n(46)\n\nh\u03a8 | \u03a6i = q1\u2217 q2 + p\u22171 p2 ,\n\n(47)\n\nwhere \u03c3\u03021B , \u03c3\u03022B , \u03c3\u03023B are the standard Pauli operators acting on the state space of the\nsecond qubit.\nThe inner product of two quaternionic states | \u03a8i = p1 | 0i + q1 | 1i and\n|\u03a6i = p2 | 0i + q2 | 1i is\nwhere \u2217 is the quaternionic conjugation operation defined by (a + bi + cj + dk)\u2217 =\n(a \u2212 bi \u2212 cj \u2212 dk), a, b, c, d \u2208 R.\nThe quaternionic transition amplitude between two states related by a local SU(2)\noperation \u00db on the first qubit can be expressed in terms of transition amplitudes in the\nordinary complex representation as\nh\u03a8 | \u00db | \u03a8i = U0 +\n\n3\nX\nj=1\n\nUj Mj3 i \u2212\n\n3\nX\nj=1\n\nUj Mj2 j +\n\n3\nX\n\nUj Mj1 k,\n\n(48)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere | \u03c8i and | \u03a8i are the complex and quaternionic representations of the same\nstate. From this we can consider the formal analogue of the Mach-Zehnder interference\nintensity\n1 1\nI = + Re(h\u03a8 | \u00db | \u03a8iq\u0302V )\n2 2\n3\n1 1\n1X\n= + U0 V0 \u2212\nUj Vk Mjk ,\n(49)\n2 2\n2j,k=1\n\nwhere the phase factor q\u0302V represents a local SU(2) operation on the second qubit. To\ncompare this intensity to the Franson interference intensity for the case \u00db \u2208 SU(2)\nand V\u0302 \u2208 SU(2), we consider equation (24) when DA = 2 and use the parameterization\nP\n\u00db = U0 1\u0302A + i 3j=1 Uj \u03c3\u0302jA , where U0 , U1 , U2 , U3 are real numbers. We then find that the\n\n\fCorrelation induced non-Abelian quantum holonomies\n\n16\n\nquaternionic Mach-Zehnder interference intensity I, is identical to the Franson intensity\nI AB , which demonstrates the correspondence between the quantum-mechanical Franson\nsetup and the quaternionic quantum-mechanics Mach-Zehnder setup as shown in figure\n5.\n\nFigure 3. Correspondence between Franson setup and quaternionic QM MachZehnder setup\n\nThis quaternionic representation of the two-qubit states can be considered a\ngeneralization of the ordinary complex spinor representation of single qubits. In the\nordinary single qubit representation, the Hilbert space is the space of normalized\ncomplex spinors S 3 and the projective Hilbert space is the space of spinors modulo\na phase factor S 3 /U(1) = S 3 /S 1 = S 2 = CP 1 , the complex projective space of\ncomplex dimension one. In this quaternionic representation of two-qubit states, the\nHilbert space is the space of normalized quaternionic spinors S 7 . The quaternionic\nprojective Hilbert space is the space of quaternionic spinors modulo a unit quaternion\nacting from the left, representing, as mentioned above, a SU(2) = S 3 rotation of\nthe second qubit. This implies that the quaternionic projective Hilbert space is\nS 7 /S 3 = S 4 = HP 1 , the quaternionic projective space of quaternionic dimension one, or\nreal dimension 4. While the ordinary single qubit representation corresponds to the first\nHopf fibration S 1 \u0592\u2192 S 3 \u0592\u2192 S 2 , the quaternionic two qubit representation corresponds to\nthe second Hopf fibration S 3 \u0592\u2192 S 7 \u0592\u2192 S 4 . This quaternionic two-qubit representation\nis much similar to a qubit in quaternionic quantum mechanics [31] except that in this\nrepresentation the absolute quaternionic phase corresponds to a rotation of the second\nqubit and thus is a measurable quantity.\nWithin this representation of pure two qubit states, L\u00e9vay [24] studied the\nquaternionic analogue of the Pancharatnam parallel transport. L\u00e9vay's parallelity\ncondition and related parallel transport are defined such that two quaternionic states\nare parallel if their inner product is a real and positive number. This condition is in\nconcordance with the Mach-Zehnder analogue picture since the maximal intensity is\nachieved when the unit quaternion phase factor q\u0302V is such that h\u03a8 | \u00db | \u03a8iq\u0302V is real and\npositive. We next consider a family of spinors that are stepwise unitarily evolved from\nthe same initial state | \u03a80 i and demand that in each step the initial and final states are\n\n\fCorrelation induced non-Abelian quantum holonomies\n\n17\n\nparallel. The transition amplitude between two consecutive spinors in this family is\n(n)\n\nh\u03a8n\u22121 | \u03a8n i = h\u03a8n\u22121 | \u00db(n) | \u03a8n\u22121 iq\u0302V = \u03bb,\n\n\u03bb \u2208 R+ ,\n\n(50)\n\nwhere | \u03a8n\u22121 i = \u00db(n \u2212 1) | \u03a80 iq\u0302V (n \u2212 1), and we use the notation \u00db(n \u2212 1) =\n(1) (2)\n(n\u22121)\n\u00db(n\u22121) \u00db(n\u22122) . . . \u00db(1) and q\u0302V (n \u2212 1) = q\u0302V q\u0302V . . . q\u0302V\n. Thus\n(n)\u2217\n\nh\u03a8n\u22121 | \u00db(n) | \u03a8n\u22121 i = \u03bbqV\n\n,\n\n(51)\n\nor by using equations (46) and (48)\n(n)\n\nU0 +\n\n3\nX\nj=1\n\n=\n\n3\n3\nX\nX\n(n)\n(n)\n(n)\nUj Mj3 i \u2212 Uj Mj2 j + Uj Mj1 k =\n\n(n)\n\u03bb(V0\n\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\n\u2212\n\n(n)\nV3 i\n\n+\n\n(n)\nV2 j\n\n\u2212\n\n(n)\nV1 k).\n\n(52)\n\nHence\n(n)\n\nV0\n\n(n)\n\nVj\n\n1 (n)\nU ,\n\u03bb 0\n3\n1 X (n)\nU Mkj .\n= \u2212\n\u03bb k=1 k\n=\n\n(53)\n\n(n)\n(n)2 P P\nThe parameter \u03bb must be chosen to normalize V (n) , hence \u03bb2 = U0 + i ( j Uj Mji )2 .\nIf we compare this to equation (25), when DA = 2 and again use the parameterization\nP\n\u00db = U0 1\u0302A + i 3j=1 Uj \u03c3\u0302jA , where U0 , U1 , U2 , U3 are real numbers, we find that this\nparallelity condition is the same as that in equation (53).\nTo find the L\u00e9vay connection, we consider the infinitesimal limit in which the\nparallel transport condition reads\n\nhd\u03a8 | \u03a8i = 0,\n\n(54)\n\nhd\u03a8 | \u03a8i = dqV \u2217 qV + hd\u03a8 | \u00dbd\u00db\u2020 | \u03a8i.\n\n(55)\n\nwhere | \u03a8i is the instantaneous state. If we only allow changes generated by the local\nunitaries \u00db and qV we have\nImposing the parallel transport condition hd\u03a8 | \u03a8i = 0, and using equations (46) and\n(48) we find this to be equivalent to\n\n(dV V \u2020 )j = \u2212\n\n3\nX\n\n(dUU \u2020 )k Mkj .\n\n(56)\n\nk=1\n\nTo compare this expression with the connection in our construction we consider equation\n(36) for DA = DB = 2, and note that for SU(2) all symmetric structure constants djkl\nare zero.

Since\nthe correlation matrix M will be relevant to the relation between dUU\nBjk = \u03b4jk for j, k 6= 0 it immediately follows that equation (36) reduces to equation (56).\n6. Conclusion\nWe have constructed a parallel transport procedure in the same spirit as that of\nPancharatnam [6, 7, 8], in the sense that it defines parallelity with reference to\nmaximization of an interferometric quantity. The interferometric quantity chosen in\nthis case is the coincidence intensity of a Franson type interferometer. The phase is\ntaken to be the local degrees of freedom of one of the subsystems.\nGiven two different two-partite states related by local unitary evolution of one\nof the subsystems, the unitary operation that needs to be applied to the other\nsubsystem to achieve parallelity, depends on the correlation present in the full bipartite\nsystem. Generally phase unitaries that correspond to different parallel transports do not\ncommute, however, when the system is uncorrelated, only Abelian phase factors need\nto be applied. Thus the holonomy group related to the parallel transport condition is\nAbelian if the bipartite state is uncorrelated, and a non-Abelian holonomy group can\nbe said to be correlation induced.\nThe procedure is defined for arbitrary bipartite systems, pure as well as mixed.\nIn the infintesimal limit of the parallel transport, the connection form can be found\nas a closed expression for arbitrary dimension. On the other hand, finding a closed\nexpression for parallel transport when the steps are finite appears to be non-trivial in\nthe general U(D) case. The procedure can be restricted to subgroups of the full unitary\ngroups. In the pure two-qubit case when only SU(2) operators are considered it has\nbeen shown that this procedure is related to L\u00e9vay parallel transport [24]. Therefore\nour construction opens up for experimental tests of the L\u00e9vay geometric phase in the\nspecial case of local SU(2) evolutions.\nAcknowledgments\nM.E. acknowledges support from the Swedish Research Council (VR).
