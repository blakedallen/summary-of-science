Guendelman1\nPhysics Department, Ben Gurion University, Beer Sheva, Israel\n\nAbstract\nThe possibility of mass in the context of scale-invariant, generally\ncovariant theories, is discussed. Scale invariance is considered in the\ncontext of a gravitational theory\nwhere the action,\nin the first order\nR\nR\n\u221a\nformalism, is of the form S = L1 \u03a6d4 x + L2 \u2212gd4 x where \u03a6 is\na density built out of degrees of freedom independent of the metric.\nFor global scale invariance, a \"dilaton\" \u03c6 has to be introduced, with\nnon-trivial potentials V (\u03c6) = f1 e\u03b1\u03c6 in L1 and U (\u03c6) = f2 e2\u03b1\u03c6 in L2 .\nThis leads to non-trivial mass generation and a potential for \u03c6 which is\ninteresting for new inflation. Scale invariant mass terms for fermions\nlead to a possible explanation of the present day accelerated universe\nand of cosmic coincidences.\n\nThe concept of scale invariance appears as an attractive possibility for\na fundamental symmetry of nature. In its most naive realizations, such a\nsymmetry is not a viable symmetry, however, since nature seems to have\nchosen some typical scales.\nHere we will find that scale invariance can nevertheless be incorporated\ninto realistic, generally covariant field theories. However, scale invariance has\nto be discussed in a more general framework than that of standard generally\nrelativistic theories, where we must allow in the action, in addition to the\n\u221a\nordinary measure of integration \u2212gd4 x, another one, \u03a6d4 x, where \u03a6 is a\ndensity built out of degrees of freedom independent of the metric.\nFor example, given 4-scalars \u03c6a (a = 1,2,3,4), one can construct the density\n\u03a6 = \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b5abcd \u2202\u03bc \u03c6a \u2202\u03bd \u03c6b \u2202\u03b1 \u03c6c \u2202\u03b2 \u03c6d\n(1)\n1\n\nElectronic address: guendel@bgumail.bgu.ac.il\n\n1\n\n\fOne can allow both geometrical objects to enter the theory and consider1\nS=\n\nZ\n\nL1 \u03a6d4 x +\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\nL2 \u2212gd4 x\n\n(2)\n\nHere L1 and L2 are \u03c6a independent. There is a good reason not to\n\u221a\n2\nconsider mixing of \u03a6 and \u2212g , like for example using \u221a\u03a6\u2212g . This is because\n(2) is invariant (up to the integral of a total divergence) under the infinite\ndimensional symmetry \u03c6a \u2192 \u03c6a +fa (L1 ) where fa (L1 ) is an arbitrary function\nof L1 if L1 and L2 are \u03c6a independent. Such symmetry (up to the integral\nof a total divergence) is absent if mixed terms are present.\nWe will study now the dynamics of a scalar field \u03c6 interacting with gravity\nas given by the action (2) with2\nL1 =\n\n1\n\u22121\nR(\u0393, g) + g \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6 \u2212 V (\u03c6), L2 = U(\u03c6)\n\u03ba\n2\n\n(3)\n\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nR(\u0393, g) = g \u03bc\u03bd R\u03bc\u03bd (\u0393), R\u03bc\u03bd (\u0393) = R\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\n, R\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3\n(\u0393) = \u0393\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd,\u03c3 \u2212\u0393\u03bb\u03bc\u03c3,\u03bd +\u0393\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3 \u0393\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\u0393\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd \u0393\u03b1\u03bc\u03c3 .\n(4)\n\u03bb\nIn the variational principle \u0393\u03bc\u03bd , g\u03bc\u03bd , the measure fields scalars \u03c6a and the\nscalar field \u03c6 are all to be treated as independent variables.\nIf we perform the global scale transformation (\u03b8 = constant)\n\ng\u03bc\u03bd \u2192 e\u03b8 g\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(5)\n\nthen (2), with the definitions (3), (4), is invariant provided V (\u03c6) and U(\u03c6)\nare of the form\nV (\u03c6) = f1 e\u03b1\u03c6 , U(\u03c6) = f2 e2\u03b1\u03c6\n(6)\nand \u03c6\u0012a is transformed\naccording to \u03c6a \u2192 \u03bba \u03c6a (no sum on a) which means\n\u0013\n\u03a6\u2192\n\nQ\n\na\n\n\u03bba \u03a6 \u2261 \u03bb\u03a6 such that \u03bb = e\u03b8 and \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6 \u2212 \u03b1\u03b8 . In this case we call\n\nthe scalar field \u03c6 needed to implement scale invariance \"dilaton\".\nLet us consider the equations which are obtained from the variation of the\n\u03c6a fields. We obtain then A\u03bca \u2202\u03bc L1 = 0 where A\u03bca = \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b5abcd \u2202\u03bd \u03c6b \u2202\u03b1 \u03c6c \u2202\u03b2 \u03c6d .\n\u22124\nSince det (A\u03bca ) = 44! \u03a63 6= 0 if \u03a6 6= 0. Therefore if \u03a6 6= 0 we obtain that\n\u2202\u03bc L1 = 0, or that L1 = M, where M is constant. This constant M appears\nin a self-consistency condition of the equations of motion that allows us to\nsolve for \u03c7 \u2261 \u221a\u03a6\u2212g\n2\n\n\f2U(\u03c6)\n.\n(7)\nM + V (\u03c6)\nTo get the physical content of the theory, it is convenient to go to the\nEinstein conformal frame where\n\u03c7=\n\ng \u03bc\u03bd = \u03c7g\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(8)\n\nand \u03c7 given by (7). In terms of g \u03bc\u03bd the non Riemannian contribution (defined\nas \u03a3\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd = \u0393\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 {\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd } where {\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd } is the Christoffel symbol), disappears from\nthe equations, which can be written then in the Einstein form (R\u03bc\u03bd (g \u03b1\u03b2 ) =\nusual Ricci tensor)\n1\n\u03ba ef f\n(\u03c6)\nR\u03bc\u03bd (g \u03b1\u03b2 ) \u2212 g \u03bc\u03bd R(g \u03b1\u03b2 ) = T\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n2\n\n(9)\n\nwhere\n1\n1\nef f\n(V + M)2 .\nT\u03bc\u03bd\n(\u03c6) = \u03c6,\u03bc \u03c6,\u03bd \u2212 g \u03bc\u03bd \u03c6,\u03b1 \u03c6,\u03b2 g \u03b1\u03b2 + g \u03bc\u03bd Vef f (\u03c6), Vef f (\u03c6) =\n2\n4U(\u03c6)\n(10)\n\u03b1\u03c6\n2\u03b1\u03c6\nIf V (\u03c6) = f1 e and U(\u03c6) = f2 e\nas required by scale invariance, we obtain\nfrom (10)\n1\nVef f =\n(f1 + Me\u2212\u03b1\u03c6 )2\n(11)\n4f2\nSince we can always perform the transformation \u03c6 \u2192 \u2212\u03c6 we can choose\nf2\nby convention \u03b1 > O. We then see that as \u03c6 \u2192 \u221e, Vef f \u2192 4f12 = const. providing an infinite flat region. Also a minimum is achieved at zero cosmological\nf1\nf1\nconstant for the case M\n< O at the point \u03c6min = \u22121\nln | M\n|. Finally, the sec\u03b1\n\u03b12\n\u2032\u2032\n| f1 |2 > O\nond derivative of the potential Vef f at the minimum is Vef f = 2f\n2\nif f2 > O,\nThere are many interesting issues that one can raise here. The first one is\nof course the fact that a realistic scalar field potential, with massive excitations when considering the true vacuum state, is achieved in a way consistent\nwith the idea of scale invariance.\nThe second point to be raised is that since there is an infinite region of\nflat potential for \u03c6 \u2192 \u221e, we expect a slow rolling new inflationary3 scenario\nto be viable, provided the universe is started at a sufficiently large value of\nthe scalar field \u03c6.\n3\n\n\fFurthermore, one can consider this model as suitable for the present day\nuniverse rather than for the early universe, after we suitably reinterpret the\nmeaning of the scalar field \u03c6. This can provide a long lived almost constant\nvacuum energy for a long period of time, which can be small if f12 /4f2 is\nsmall. Such small energy density will eventually disappear when the universe\nachieves its true vacuum state. 2\nf\nNotice that a small value of f12 can be achieved if we let f2 >> f1 . In this\nf2\n\ncase f12 << f1 , i.e. a very small scale for the energy density of the universe is\nobtained by the existence of a very high scale (that of f2 ) the same way as a\nsmall fermion mass is obtained in the see-saw mechanism4 from the existence\nalso of a large mass scale. In what follows, we will take f2 >> f1 .\nSo far we have studied a theory which contains the metric tensor g\u03bc\u03bd , the\nmeasure fields \u03c6a (a=1,2,3,4) and the \"dilaton\" \u03c6, which makes global scale\ninvariance possible in a non-trivial way. All of the above fields have some\nkind of geometrical significance, but if we are to describe the real world, the\nlist of fields and/or particles has to be enlarged.\nTaking, for example, the case of a fermion \u03c8, where the kinetic term of\nthe fermion is chosen to be part of L1\nSf k =\n\nZ\n\nLf k \u03a6d4 x\n\n(12)\n\ni\n1\n1\n\u2190\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\nLf k = \u03c8[\u03b3 a Va\u03bc ( \u2202 \u03bc + \u03c9\u03bccd \u03c3cd ) \u2212 ( \u2202 \u03bc + \u03c9\u03bccd\u03c3cd )\u03b3 a Va\u03bc ]\u03c8\n(13)\n2\n2\n2\nthere Va\u03bc is the vierbein, \u03c3cd = 12 [\u03b3c , \u03b3d ], the spin connection \u03c9\u03bccd is determined\nby variation with respect to \u03c9\u03bccd and, for self-consistency, the curvature scalar\nis taken to be (if we want to deal with \u03c9\u03bcab instead of \u0393\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd everywhere)\nc\nc\nR = V a\u03bc V b\u03bd R\u03bc\u03bdab (\u03c9), R\u03bc\u03bdab (\u03c9) = \u2202\u03bc \u03c9\u03bdab \u2212\u2202\u03bd \u03c9\u03bcab +(\u03c9\u03bca\n\u03c9\u03bdcb \u2212\u03c9\u03bda\n\u03c9\u03bccb ). (14)\n\nGlobal scale invariance is obtained provided \u03c8 also transforms, as in \u03c8 \u2192\n\u03bb \u03c8. Mass term consistent with scale invariance exist,\n\u2212 14\n\nSf m = m1\n\nZ\n\n\u03c8\u03c8e\u03b1\u03c6/2 \u03a6d4 x + m2\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n\u03c8\u03c8e3\u03b1\u03c6/2 \u2212gd4 x.\n\n(15)\n\nIf we consider the situation where m1 e\u03b1\u03c6/2 \u03c8\u03c8 or m2 e3\u03b1\u03c6/2 \u03c8\u03c8 are much\nbigger than V (\u03c6) + M, i.e. a high density approximation, we obtain that\n4\n\n\finstead of (7) that the consistency condition is1 (3m2 e3\u03b1\u03c6/2 + m1 e\u03b1\u03c6/2 \u03c7)\u03c8\u03c8 =\n2 \u03b1\u03c6\n0, which means \u03c7 = \u2212 3m\ne . Using this in (15), we obtain, after going to\nm1\nthe conformal Einstein frame, which involves, also a transformation of the\nfermion fields, necessary so as to achieve Einstein-Cartan form for both the\ngravitational and fermion equations. These transformations are, g \u03bc\u03bd = \u03c7g\u03bc\u03bd\n1\n1\na\n(or V \u03bc = \u03c7 2 V\u03bca ) and \u03c8 \u2032 = \u03c7\u2212 4 \u03c8 and they lead to a mass term,\nSf m\n\n|m1 | 3/2\n)\n= \u22122m2 (\n3|m2 |\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2212g\u03c8 \u03c8 \u2032 d4 x\n\n(16)\n\nThe \u03c6 dependence of the mass term has disappeared, i.e. masses are\nconstants.\nThere is one situation where the low density of matter can also give results\nwhich are similar to those obtained in the high density approximation, in that\nthe coupling of the \u03c6 field disappears and that the mass term becomes of a\nconventional form in the Einstein conformal frame.\nThis is the case, when we study the theory for the limit \u03c6 \u2192 \u221e . Then\nU(\u03c6) \u2192 \u221e and V (\u03c6) \u2192 \u221e. In this case, taking m1 e\u03b1\u03c6/2 \u03c8\u03c8 and m2 e3\u03b1\u03c6/2 \u03c8\u03c8\nmuch smaller than V (\u03c6) or U(\u03c6) respectively, therefore one can see that (7) is\na good approximation and since also M can be ignored in the self consistency\n2 \u03b1\u03c6\ncondition (7) in this limit, we get then, \u03c7 = 2f\ne . If this is inserted in (15),\nf1\nR\u221a\n\u2032 \u2032 4\n\u2212g\u03c8 \u03c8 d x, where\nwe get Sf m = m\nm = m1 (\n\nf1 1\nf1 3\n) 2 + m2 (\n)2\n2f2\n2f2\n\n(17)\n\nComparing (16) and (17) and taking m1 and m2 of the same order of\nmagnitude, we see that the mass of the Dirac particle is much smaller in the\nregion \u03c6 \u2192 \u221e, for which (17) is valid, than it is in the region of high density\nof the Dirac particle relative to V (\u03c6) + M, as displayed in eq. (16), if the\n\"see-saw\" assumption ff12 << 1 is made.\nTherefore if space is populated by these diluted Dirac particles of this\ntype, the mass of these particles will grow substantially if we go to the true\nvacuum state valid in the absence of matter, i.e. V + M = 0, as dictated\nby Vef f given by eq. (11). The presence of matter pushes therefore the\nminimum of energy to a state where V + M > 0. The real vacuum in\nthe presence of matter should not be located in the region \u03c6 \u2192 \u221e, which\nminimizes the matter energy, but maximizes the potential energy Vef f and\n5\n\n\fnot at V + M = 0, which minimizes Vef f , and where particle masses are big,\nbut somewhere in a balanced intermediate stage. Clearly how much above\nV + M = 0 such true vacuum is located must be correlated to how much\nparticle density is there in the Universe. A non zero vacuum energy, which\nmust be of the same order of the particle energy density, has to appear and\nthis could explain the \"accelerated universe\" that appears to be implied by\nthe most recent observations, together with the \"cosmic coincidence\", that\nrequires the vacuum energy be of the same order of magnitude to the matter\nenergy5 .\nI would like to thank J.
