Since then this term is\nused for media with the dielectric susceptibility varying\nperiodically in the space and allowing the Bragg diffraction of the light. The theory of photonic crystals has\nbeen developed in a number of subsequent works, see,\ne.g., Refs. 3,4,5,6,7. The main goal of these studies was\nto determine the photon band structure and analyze the\nsequence of allowed bands and stop-bands (gaps) for different directions of the wave vector in the first Brillouin\nzone. The simplest model realization of a photonic crystal is a structure grown from two materials, A and B, with\ndifferent dielectric constants \u03b5A and \u03b5B : a periodic layered medium ...A/B/A/B... in case of one-dimensional\nphotonic crystals and periodic arrays of cylinders and\nspheres of the material A embedded in a dielectric matrix B, in case of two-dimensional and three-dimensional\nphotonic crystals, respectively. Periodic structures where\nthe dielectric susceptibility of one of the compositional\nmaterials, as a function of the frequency \u03c9, has a pole at\na certain resonance frequency are grouped into a special\nclass of resonant photonic crystals. In such systems the\nnormal light waves are excitonic polaritons. In Refs. 8,9\nthe dispersion of light waves has been calculated taking into consideration the frequency dependence of the\ndielectric susceptibility in the frame of the local material relation D = \u03b5A (\u03c9)E between the electric displacement and the electric field. In Ref. 10 the dispersion of\nexcitonic polaritons in a resonant photonic crystal has\nbeen calculated taking into account only one level of the\nquantum-confined exciton in a sphere A and neglecting\nthe difference between the dielectric constant \u03b5B and the\nbackground dielectric constant \u03b5a of the material A. In\nthe present work we have studied theoretically the dispersion of excitonic polaritons in a resonant photonic crystal making allowance for all available exciton quantumconfinement levels as well as for the dielectric contrast,\ni.e., for \u03b5a 6= \u03b5B .\n\n2.\n\nPROBLEM DEFINITION AND METHOD OF\nCALCULATION\n\nIn this work the theory of resonant photonic crystals\nis developed for a periodic array of spheres A arranged\nin a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice and embedded in\nthe matrix B. The structure under consideration is characterized by seven parameters: R, a, \u03b5B , \u03b5a , \u03c9LT , \u03c90\nand M . Here R is the radius of the spheres A, a is the\nlattice constant for the FCC lattice, \u03b5B is the dielectric constant of the matrix, \u03c90 , \u03c9LT and M are the resonance frequency, longitudinal-transverse splitting and\ntranslational effective mass of the triplet 1s exciton excited inside the spheres A, \u03b5a is the background dielectric\nconstant that contains contributions to the dielectric response from all other electron-hole excitations. Thus, we\nassume the dielectric function of the bulk material A to\nhave the form\n\u03b5a \u03c9LT\nh\u0304q 2\n\u03b5A (\u03c9, q) = \u03b5a +\n, \u03c9exc (q) = \u03c90 +\n(1)\n\u03c9exc (q) \u2212 \u03c9\n2M\nand, in that way, take into account both the frequency\nand spatial dispersion, i.e. the dependence on the light\nfrequency \u03c9 and wave vector q. The radius R is chosen\nso that, on the\n\u221a one hand, the spheres A do not overlap,\ni.e. R < a/2 2, but, on the other hand, R should exceed\nthe Bohr radius of the 1s-exciton in the material A and,\nhence, the exciton can be considered as a single particle\nwith the mass M . In the following we ignore the frequency dependence of the parameters \u03b5B and \u03b5a . Moreover, hereafter we assume the material A to be isotropic\nand take into consideration the bulk 1s exciton states\nonly. It follows then that the problem is reduced to the\nsolution of a system of two vector equations, namely, the\nwave equation\n\u0010 \u03c9 \u00112 \u0002\n\u0003\n\u03b5(r)E(r) + 4\u03c0Pexc (r)\n(2)\nrot rot E(r) =\nc\nand the material equation for the 1s-exciton contribution\nto the dielectric polarization\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b5a \u03c9LT\nh\u0304\n\u2206 + \u03c90 \u2212 \u03c9 Pexc (r) =\nE(r) ,\n(3)\n\u2212\n2M\n4\u03c0\n\n\f2\nwhere \u03b5(r) = \u03b5a inside the spheres and \u03b5(r) = \u03b5B outside the spheres, E(r) and Pexc (r) are the electric field\nand the excitonic polarization at the frequency \u03c9. On a\nspherical surface separating materials A and B we impose\nthe standard Maxwell boundary conditions: continuity of\nthe tangential components of the electric and magnetic\nfields, and the Pekar additional boundary condition for\nthe excitonic polarization: the vanishing vector Pexc (r)\nat |r \u2212 a| = R, where the translational vectors a define\nthe centers of spheres A.\nDue to the periodicity of the structure we can seek\nsolutions of Eqs. (2) and (3) in the Bloch form satisfying\nthe condition\nEk (r + a) = eika Ek (r) .\n\n(4)\n\nHere k is the exciton-polariton wave vector defined\nwithin the first Brillouin zone. We remind that, for a\nFCC lattice, the latter is a dodecahedron bounded by six\nsquares and eight hexagons.\nBelow we present the results of calculation of the\nexciton-polariton dispersion \u03c9nk , where n is the branch\nindex. The computation was mainly performed by using a photon analogue of the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker\n(KKR) method11,12,13 . In this method (i) the electric\nfield is decomposed in the spherical waves, or more precisely, in the vector spherical functions centered at the\npoints r = a, and (ii) following the consideration of the\nlight scattering by a single sphere and the introduction of\na structural factor the dispersion equation is transformed\nto\n|\u03b4j \u2032 j \u03b4m\u2032 m \u03b4\u03c3\u2032 \u03c3 \u2212 Gj \u2032 m\u2032 \u03c3\u2032 ,jm\u03c3 (k, \u03c9)Rj\u03c3 (\u03c9)| = 0 .\n\n(5)\n\nHere Rj\u03c3 are the coefficients describing the scattering of\nspherical waves by a single sphere A, they depend on the\ntotal angular momentum j and the polarization index \u03c3\ndiscriminating the magnetic and electric spherical harmonics but are independent of the angular-momentum\ncomponent m. Note that, for a spherical scatterer, these\ncoefficients relate the incident field E0 (r) \u221d Jjm\u03c3 (r)\nwith the scattered field Esc (r) \u221d Hjm\u03c3 (r), where\nJjm\u03c3 , Hjm\u03c3 are the vector spherical functions13 . Ajiki\net al.14 have calculated values of Rj\u03c3 (\u03c9) taking into\naccount the exciton resonance in the spheres A and\nthe finite exciton effective mass M . In contrast to the\nscattering matrix for a single sphere which is diagonal,\nRj \u2032 m\u2032 \u03c3\u2032 ,jm\u03c3 \u2261 Rj\u03c3 \u03b4j \u2032 m\u2032 \u03c3\u2032 ,jm\u03c3 , the matrix of structural\nfactors Gj \u2032 m\u2032 \u03c3\u2032 ,jm\u03c3 (k, \u03c9) has nonvanishing diagonal and\noff-diagonal components. It should be mentioned that\nthe both matrices are frequency dependent whereas only\nthe structural matrix G depends upon the polariton wave\nvector k. At the same time G is independent of the excitonic parameters and coincides with the matrix considered in Refs. 11,12,13 where the exciton states are disregarded.\nIn addition to the KKR method, in section 4 we apply\nthe Green-function technique for the analysis of separate\ncontributions of quantum-confined excitonic levels to the\n\n0\n\n(\u03c9-\u03c91)/\u03c9LT\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n-5\n\nX\n\nL\n\nU\n\n\u039b\n\n\u0393\n\n\u2206\n\nX\n\nZ W\n\nK\n\nFIG. 1: Exciton-polariton band structure of a photonic crystal with a FCC lattice of spheres A inserted into the matrix B.\nThe calculation is performed neglecting the dielectric contrast\nand for the set of parameters indicated in the text.\n\npolariton dispersion, and in section 5 we use the two-wave\napproximation which allows an analytic description.\n3.\n\nPOLARITON DISPERSION FOR A FINITE\nEXCITON MASS\n\nFirst we focus the attention upon purely excitonic effects and neglect the dielectric contrast assuming \u03b5a =\n\u03b5B . Then in the absence of exciton-photon interaction,\ni.e. for \u03c9LT = 0, the medium becomes optically homogeneous and photons propagating therein are characterized\nby the linear dispersion \u03c9 = cq/nB with the refractive in\u221a\ndex nB = \u03b5B . In the reduced zone scheme, this singlevalued relation between the frequency and wave vector q\nturns into the many-valued (or multi-branch) dispersion\ncurve\n\u03c9k = c|k + b|/nB ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere b is the reciprocal lattice vector reducing q to the\nvector k = q \u2212 b that lies in the first Brillouin zone. A\nnonvanishing value of \u03c9LT leads to a mixing between photonic and excitonic states and formation of hybrid polariton excitations characterized by a complicated multiband\ndispersion \u03c9nk . As a result the wave (n, k) is a mixture\nof two or more photonic states (6) with the same k but\ndifferent b.\nFig. 1 presents the dispersion of exciton-polaritons calculated for a FCC lattice and the following set of structure parameters:\n\u03b5a = \u03b5B = 10 , R = a/4 , h\u0304\u03c91 = 2 eV , \u03c9LT = 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u03c91 ,\n\nP \u2261\n\n\u221a\n\n3\u03c0c\n\u03c9 1 nB a\n\n!3\n\n= 1.1 , M = 0.5 m0 .\n\nHere m0 is the free electron mass in vacuum and, instead\n\n\f3\nof the bulk exciton resonance frequency \u03c90 , we introduced the resonance frequency\n\n0\n\n0.0\n\n(7)\n\nof the ground state of the exciton quantum-confined in\na sphere of the radius R. Note that, for the structure\ntuned to the Bragg resonance \u03c91 \u221a\n= ckL /nb at the point\nL of the Brillouin zone with kL = 3\u03c0/a or \u03c91 = ckX /nb\nat the point\u221aX with kX = 2\u03c0/a, the parameter P equals\nto 1 and 3 3/8 \u2248 0.65, respectively. For P = 1.1, the\nanticrossing between the horizontal line \u03c9 = \u03c91 (\"bare\"\nexciton branch) and the line \u03c9 = ck/nB (\"bare\" photon\nbranch) occurs inside the Brillouin zone at k amounting\napproximately 97% of kL and 84% of kX . For the sake\nof completeness the dependence \u03c9(k) is shown not only\nalong the high-symmetry crystallographic directions k k\n[001] (points \u2206) and k k [111] (points \u039b) but also along\nthe straight lines X \u2212 W , W \u2212 K, X \u2212 U and U \u2212 L.\nIn Fig. 1 the frequency region is cut from above in order to keep only few branches of the dispersion curve.\nIn the cut region the dispersion is presented by a dense\nnetwork of polariton branches which appear as a result\nof the anticrossing of \"bare\" photonic branches (6) with\na set of close-lying exciton quantum-confinement levels.\nThe network has a tangled character complicated for depiction. Therefore, we concentrate here on the analysis\nof the role played by the photonic-crystal parameters in\nthe formation of the lower polariton branches.\nIn Fig. 2 the solid curves show the same dispersion branches as in the previous figure but in an increased scale and in the vicinity of the points X and L.\nFor comparison we also present, by dashed-and-dotted\nlines, the lower branch of the dispersion curve calculated\ntaking into account only the ground exciton quantumconfinement level. The calculation was performed by\nreducing the value of M to 0.01m0 and decreasing \u03c90\nso that the frequency \u03c91 in Eq. (7) was kept invariant.\nThe dashed-and-dotted lines coincide with those calculated by the method proposed for exciton-polaritons in\nRef. 10. Dashed curves illustrate the opposite limiting\ncase of quite heavy excitons, M \u2192 \u221e. In this case the relation between the exciton polarization and electric field\nbecomes local:\n\u03b5a \u03c9LT\nPexc = \u03c7E ,\n\u03c7=\n.\n4\u03c0 \u03c90 \u2212 \u03c9\nIt means that values of k corresponding to a certain frequency \u03c9 can be found in the same way as it is done for\nnonresonant photonic crystal with the dielectric susceptibilities \u03b5B and \u03b5A = \u03b5a + 4\u03c0\u03c7. The calculation shows\nthat the dashed line in Fig. 2 is practically indistinguishable from the lower branch obtained according to Eq. (5)\nfor M = 5m0 . The lower polariton branch is formed as a\nresult of \"repulsion\" of the photon branch (6) with b = 0\ntowards the long-wavelength side because of the interaction with the exciton quantum-confinement levels.

The\ndispersion curves are calculated for the exciton effective mass\nM = 0.5 m0 (solid lines), M \u2192 \u221e (dashed lines) and M \u2192 0\n(dashed-and-dotted lines). Other parameters are the same as\nin Fig. 1.\n\nother levels act upon this branch to the maximum since\nin this limit their resonance frequencies coincide and are\nequal to \u03c90 . We conclude then that the lower polariton\nbranch corresponding to the finite mass M must always\nlie between the dashed-and-dotted and dashed lines, in\nagreement with the results of calculation shown in Fig. 2.\n\n4. COMPARATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF\nINDIVIDUAL QUANTUM-CONFINED EXCITON\nLEVELS\n\nIn the following we use the notation \u03c9X (M ) for the frequency at the X point in the lowest polariton branch for\nthe exciton effective mass M in the material A, \u03c9X (0)\nand \u03c9X (\u221e) for values of this frequency for M \u2192 0\nand M \u2192 \u221e, and, finally, \u03c9\u0304X for the arithmetic mean\n[\u03c9X (0) + \u03c9X (\u221e)]/2. One can see from Fig. 2 that\nthe difference \u03c91 \u2212 \u03c9\u0304X noticeably exceeds the difference\n\u03c9X (0) \u2212 \u03c9X (\u221e). This means that the main contribution to the position of the frequency \u03c9X (M ) should come\nfrom the exciton-photon coupling with the ground level\n(7). In this section we analyze in detail the influence of\nthe ground and excited levels of the quantum-confined\nexciton on the lower polariton branch. To this end we\nfollow Ref. 14, use the Green-function technique and\nexpand a solution of equation (3) with arbitrary function\nE(r) in a series\n\n\f4\n\nPexc (r) =\n\n\u03b5a X \u03c9LT X\n\u03a6\u03bd (r \u2212 a)\n4\u03c0 \u03bd \u03c9\u03bd \u2212 \u03c9 a\n\nZ\n\n\u03a6\u2217\u03bd (r \u2032 \u2212 a)E(r \u2032 )d3 r\u2032\n\n(8)\n\n|r \u2032 \u2212a|<R\n\n5.\n\nPOLARITONS IN PHOTONIC CRYSTALS\nWITH A DIELECTRIC CONTRAST\n\nThe dashed lines 1 and 2 in Fig. 4 depict the dispersion of light waves in the vicinity of the X point of the\nBrillouin zone in a nonresonant photon crystal. Exactly\nat the X point these waves are characterized by the symmetry X5 and X5\u2032 . The solid lines 1\u2032 , 2\u2032 and 3\u2032 show\nthe dispersion branches calculated taking into account\nonly the exciton-photon coupling with one excitonic level\n1s and choosing its resonance frequency in the middle\nbetween the frequencies of the \"bare\" photons X5 and\nX5\u2032 . An additional branch 4\u2032 represents longitudinal exciton states which are practically dispersionless, in the\nfollowing it is not discussed. Finally, the dashed-anddotted lines 1\u2032\u2032 , 2\u2032\u2032 illustrate the exciton-polariton dis-\n\n0\n\n5\n\n-1\n\n4\n\n4\n\n5\n\n5\n\n0.0\n\n5\n1\n2\n3\n\n-2\n\n(\u03c9-\u03c91)/\u03c9LT\n\nover the eigen states of the mechanical exciton in a\nsphere with an infinitely high barrier. Here the index\n\u03bd = (nr , l, m) characterizes the exciton state and comprises, respectively, the radial quantum number, angular\nmomentum and its projection on the z axis, \u03c9\u03bd is the\nexciton resonance frequency in the state \u03bd. It is worthwhile to note that the functions \u03a6\u03bd (r) satisfy Eq. (2) with\n\u03c9 = \u03c9\u03bd and without the inhomogeneous term, i.e., with\nE(r) \u2261 0, they are normalized to unity and correspond to\nthe sphere centered at the point r = 0. The frequencies\n\u03c9\u03bd are conveniently presented as \u03c90 + (h\u0304/2M R2 )x2nr ,l ,\nwhere xnr ,l are dimensionless numbers. For the few lowest energy levels, their values are given by \u03c0 (1s), 4.493\n(1p), 5.764 (1d), 2\u03c0 (2s), 6.988 (1f ), see e.g. Ref. 15,\nwith symbols in parenthesis indicating the radial number nr and the orbital momentum, s for l = 0, p for\nl = 1 etc. Note that these symbols characterize the exciton quantum-confined state whereas the internal exciton\nstate is 1s all the time. Substituting the expansion (8)\ninto the wave equation (2) and keeping in the sum over\n\u03bd any one term or a finite number of terms we can study\nthe effect of these terms on the formation of the polariton dispersion. The results are illustrated in Fig. 3. It\nis seen that (a) the position of the frequency \u03c9X (M ) is\nmainly determined by the exciton level 1s, (b) the polariton frequency at the X and L points is unaffected\nby the 1p level, and (c) it suffices to add the contributions from the 1d and 2s levels in order to describe quite\nwell the position of \u03c9X (M ) whereas, at the L point, the\nsum converges slowly. Obviously, this difference in the\nconvergence is related to the choice of P = 1.1 in which\ncase the effect of anticrossing near the L point is much\nstronger compared with that at the X point.\n\n-3\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n-4\n\n-0.5\n\n4\n5\n-1.0\n\n-5\n\n4\n5\n\n-6\n\nL\n\n\u039b\n1/2\n\n0.2 x 3 \u03c0/a\n\n\u2206\n\nX\n\n-1.5\n\n0.4 x 2\u03c0/a\n\nFIG. 3: Dependence of the exciton-polariton spectrum on the\nnumber of excitonic levels taken into account while calculating\nthe dispersion curve by the Green-function technique. Lines\n1, 2, 3 and 4 are obtained with allowance made, respectively,\nfor one, two, three and four lower levels; line 5 represents the\nexact result taking into account all levels of exciton quantum\nconfinement. The structure parameters used are the same as\nin Fig. 1.\n\npersion with allowance made for all exciton levels. For\nthe illustration we chose a photonic crystal with comparatively weak dielectric contrast, \u03b5B = 12, \u03b5a = 13,\nin order to have the lowest stop-band in the direction\nk k [001], or the splitting between the X5 and X5\u2032 states,\ncomparable with the matrix element of exciton-photon\ninteraction. It follows from Fig. 4 that the allowance for\nthe 1s quantum-confined exciton states optically active\nin the polarization E \u22a5 z results in a replacement of two\nbranches 1, 2 by three branches 1\u2032 , 2\u2032 and 3\u2032 . The addition of contributions due to other (excited) excitonic\nlevels leads to a transformation of the branch 1\u2032 into 1\u2032\u2032\nand an appearance an extra branch 2\u2032\u2032 . Simultaneously\na dense network of polariton branches is formed in the\nfrequency region \u03c9 > \u03c90 . It is not shown in the figure\nin order to avoid overloading the image. Instead, only\nthe exciton-polariton eigen frequencies \u03c9\u03bd > \u03c90 at the X\npoint are indicated by short horizontal lines intersecting\nthe vertical line X.\nIn what follows we propose a two-wave approximate\ndescription of the polariton spectrum which is valid for\na weak dielectric contrast and allows to understand the\nnature of branches indicated in Fig. 4 by primed and\ndouble-primed integers.

Dashed lines are calculated for a\nphotonic crystal neglecting excitons; solid lines are obtained\ntaking into account only the lowest excitonic level; dashedand-dotted lines and short straight lines are obtained taking\ninto account all quantum-confined states of the mechanical\nexciton.\n\ntors k k [001] lying close to the X point, we keep\nin this expansion only two terms with k1 = (0, 0, k1 ),\nk2 = (0, 0, k2 ) and k1 \u2212 k2 = 4\u03c0/a. At the X point\nwe have k1 = \u2212k2 = 2\u03c0/a.

Substituting Eqs. (8)\nand (9) into the wave equation (2), multiplying its terms\nby exp (\u2212ikj z) and integrating over the unit primitive\ncell v0 = a3 /4 of the FCC lattice we obtain\nX\nX\n\u0002\n\u0003\nEj\nI\u03bd(1)\u2217 I\u03bd(j) T\u03bd ,(10)\n(k1 /k0 )2 \u2212 \u03b5\u0304 E1 = \u03b5\u2032 E2 +\nj=1,2\n\n1\n= \u221a\nv0\n\nZ\n\neikj z \u03a6\u2217\u03bd (r)d3 r , T\u03bd =\n\nv0\n\n\u03b5a \u03c9LT\n,\n\u03c9\u03bd \u2212 \u03c9\n\n(11)\n\nand we assume the origin of the Cartesian coordinate\nsystem to be chosen in the center of one of the spheres\nA.\nIn the absence of the exciton-photon coupling and dielectric contrast, the right-hand sides of equations (10)\nvanish, \u03b5\u0304 = \u03b5B , and we arrive at two branches of the\ndispersion relation (6) for \"bare\" photons. At the X\npoint these branches converge. In the presence of dielectric contrast, \u03b5\u2032 6= 0 and the fourfold degenerate state\nat the X point splits into doubly-degenerate states X5\u2032\n(E1 = E2 ) and X5 (E1 = \u2212E2 ) with their eigen frequencies being\nckX\nckX\n\u03c9(X5 ) = \u221a\n, \u03c9(X5\u2032 ) = \u221a\n\u2032\n\u03b5\u0304 \u2212 \u03b5\n\u03b5\u0304 + \u03b5\u2032\n\n(12)\n\n\u2032\nand the splitting being \u03c9(X\n\u221a 5 ) \u2212 \u03c9(X5\u2032 ) \u2248 (\u03b5 /\u03b5\u0304)(ckX /n\u0304),\nwhere kX = 2\u03c0/a, n\u0304 = \u03b5\u0304. The approximate equations\n(12) reproduce with high accuracy results of the exact\ncalculation presented in Fig. 4 by dashed lines.\nIn the absence of dielectric contrast, with allowance\nfor the exciton level 1s only and negligible difference be(2)\n(1)\ntween the integrals I1s and I1s the set of equations (10)\nreduces to\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0002\n2\n(E1 + E2 ) ,\n(k1 /k0 )2 \u2212 \u03b5B E1 = (k2 /k0 )2 \u2212 \u03b5B E2 = T1s I1s\nwhere I1s is the integral (11) corresponding to the wave\nvector kX . Provided that the frequencies \u03c91 and \u03c9X \u2261\nckX /nB are close to each other, the photonic states X5 ,\nX5\u2032 are replaced by three doubly-degenerate polaritonic\nstates: one of the symmetry X5 with the frequency \u03c9X\nand two of the symmetry X5\u2032 with the frequencies\ns\u0012\n\u00132\n\u03c91 + \u03c9X\n\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c9X\n+ \u03b42 ,\n(14)\n\u00b1\n\u03c9=\n2\n2\np\n2 . For coinciding frequencies \u03c9\nwhere \u03b4 = \u03c91 \u03c9LT I1s\n1\nand \u03c9X , the polariton spectrum in the direction k k [001]\n\n(13)\n\nhas a stop-band of the width 2\u03b4 centered at \u03c9 = \u03c91 . The\ndetuning of \u03c9X from \u03c91 leads to shifts of the stop-band\nedges according to Eq. (13) and, in addition, an allowed\nband is formed in the center of the stop-band, similarly as\nit happens in the resonant Bragg quantum-well structure\n(see17 and references therein).\nFor an approximate description of the solid lines in\nFig. 4 it suffices to keep in the sums over \u03bd in Eqs. (10)\nonly the contribution due to the exciton quantumconfined ground state. In this approximation the mixing\nof the photon and exciton states of the symmetry X5\u2032\n\n\f6\nleads to their repulsion and formation of hybrid waves\nwith the frequencies\ns\u0014\n\u00152\n\u03c91 + \u03c9(X5\u2032 )\n\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c9(X5\u2032 )\n\u03c9=\n+ \u03b42 .\n(15)\n\u00b1\n2\n2\nThe previous equation (14) is a particular case of this\nmore general equation. Since the 1s quantum-confined\nexciton does not interact with the light wave of the symmetry X5 , the X5 photon frequency remains unchanged\nin the considered approximation. This allows to understand the closeness of the X5 -polariton frequencies calculated neglecting the exciton effects and taking into account only the 1s level, see the points of intersection of\nthe lines 2 and 2\u2032 with the vertical line X. Allowance\nfor the excited excitonic levels in Eq. (10) results in a\nshift of the frequency of the lowest polariton branch X5\u2032\ndownwards (line 1\u2032\u2032 ). However, their influence is small\nin comparison with the 1s exciton. At the same time, in\nthe formation of the polariton X5 (line 2\u2032\u2032 ) the main role\nis played by coupling of the photon X5 with the exciton\n1p and m = 0. The calculation shows that the branch 2\u2032\u2032\nis well described by the two-wave model (10) taking into\naccount only one excitonic state (1p, m = 0).\n6.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have developed a theory of resonant threedimensional photonic crystals made up of two compositional materials A (spheres) and B (dielectric matrix)\nfor an arbitrary value of the exciton effective mass M and\narbitrary dielectric contrast determined by the difference\nbetween the dielectric susceptibility \u03b5B of the matrix and\nthe background dielectric constant \u03b5a of the material A.\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\n10\n\nE.

Solid State 42, 1756 (2000)].\n\nFor a finite value of M , the lowest polariton branch\nlies between the branches calculated in the two limiting\ncases, namely, in the absence of space dispersion, i.e.,\nfor M \u2192 \u221e, and with allowance for only one excitonic\nlevel, i.e., for M \u2192 0 and \u03c91 = const. For a satisfactory\ndescription of the polariton branches in the frequency\nregion \u03c9 < \u03c91 , it suffices to take into account the light\ncoupling with few lowest states of the mechanical exciton.\nFor a resonant photonic crystal with the dielectric contrast, we have analyzed the exciton-induced modification\nof the stop-band in the [001] direction if the exciton resonance frequency \u03c91 is chosen to lie in the middle of\nthe stop-band of the analogous photonic crystal without excitons. If the dielectric contrast is weak so that\n|\u03b5B \u2212 \u03b5a | \u226a \u03b5B then one can use the two-wave approximation that allows describe with good accuracy the results of numerical calculation. The main contribution\ninto the position of the lower edge of the polariton stopband along the \u0393 \u2212 X line comes from the exciton 1s\nstates interacting with the light wave of the X5\u2032 symmetry. The upper edge of the stop-band is governed by the\ncoupling of the exciton (1p, m = 0) with the photon of\nthe X5 symmetry.\nIt should be noted that the developed theory with\nM \u2192 \u221e can be applied for the study of photonic\ncrystals infiltrated with dye aggregates periodically distributed in the space and characterized by a certain resonance frequency of optical transitions, see18 and references therein. The theory can be applied as well for the\ncalculation of the dispersion of exciton-polaritons in resonant two-dimensional photonic crystals, e.g., in periodic\narrays of cylinders A embedded into the matrix B.\nThe work is supported by the Russian Foundation for\nBasic Research (grant 05-02-16372) and the program of\nthe Russian Ministry of Science and Education.\n\n11\n12\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\nA.
