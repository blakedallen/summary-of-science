Assuming that w(E) satisfies the Pollard's Condition (i.e. Every non-zero\nelement of w(E) \u2212 w(E) generates G), we obtain a formulae for the number of distinct base\nweights. If |G| is a prime, our result coincides with a result Schrijver and Seymour.\nWe also describe Equality cases in this formulae. In the prime case, our result generalizes\nVosper's Theorem.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLet G be a finite cyclic group and let A, B be nonempty subsets of G. The starting point of\nMinkowski set sum estimation is the inequality |A + B| \u2265 min(|G|, |A| + |B| \u2212 1), where |G| is a\nprime, proved by Cauchy [2] and rediscovered by Davenport [4]. The first generalization of this\nresult, due to Chowla [3], states that |A + B| \u2265 min(|G|, |A| + |B| \u2212 1), if there is a b \u2208 B such\nthat every non-zero element of B \u2212 b generates G. In order to generalize his extension of the\nCauchy-Davenport Theorem [11] to composite moduli, Pollard introduced in [12] the following\nmore sophisticated Chowla type condition: Every non-zero element of B \u2212 B generates G.\nEquality cases of the Cauchy-Davenport were determined by Vosper in [16, 17]. Vosper's\nTheorem was generalized by Kemperman [9]. We need only a light form of Kemperman's result\nstated in the beginning of Kemperman's paper.\nWe need the following combination of Chowla and Kemperman results:\nTheorem A (Chowla [3], Kemperman [9]) Let A, B be non-empty subsets of a cyclic group G\nwith |A|, |B| \u2265 2 such that for some b \u2208 B, every non-zero element of B \u2212 b generates G. Then\n|A + B| \u2265 |A| + |B| \u2212 1.\nMoreover |A + B| = |A| + |B| \u2212 1 if and only if A + B is an arithmetic progression.\nA shortly proved generalization of this result to non-abelian groups is obtained in [8].\n\u2217\n\nUniversit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie, E.

The Erd\u0151s-Ginzburg-Ziv Theorem [6] was the starting point of this area. This\nresult states that a sequence of elements of an abelian group G with length \u2265 2|G| \u2212 1 contains\na zero-sum subsequence of length = |G|.\nThe reader may find some details on these two areas of Additive Combinatorics in the text\nbooks: Nathanson [10], Geroldinger-Halter-Koch [7] and Tao-Vu [15]. More specific questions\nmay be found in Caro's survey paper [1].\nThe notion of a matroid was introduced by Whitney in 1935 as a generalization of a matrix. Two pioneer works connecting matroids and Additive Combinatorics are due to SchrijverSeymour [14], Dias da Silva-Nathanson [5]. Recently, in [13], orientability of matroids is naturally related with an open problem on Bernoulli matrices.\nStating the first result requires some vocabulary:\nLet E be a finite set. The set of the subsets of E will be denoted by 2E .\nA matroid over E is an ordered pair (E, B) where B \u2286 2E satisfies the following axioms:\n(B1) B 6= \u2205.\n(B2) For all B, B \u2032 \u2208 B, if B \u2286 B \u2032 then B = B \u2032 .\n(B3) For all B, B \u2032 \u2208 B and x \u2208 B \\ B \u2032 , there is a y \u2208 B \u2032 \\ B such that (B \\ {x}) \u222a {y} \u2208 B.\nA set belonging to B is called a basis of the matroid M.\nThe rank of a subset A \u2286 E is by definition rM (A) := max{|B \u2229 A| : B is a basis of M }.\nWe write r(M ) = r(E). The reference to M could be omitted. A hyperplane of the matroid M\nis a maximal subset of E with rank = r(M ) \u2212 1.\n\u0001\n\u0001\nThe uniform matroid of rank r on a set E is by definition Ur (E) = (E, Er ), where Er is\nthe set of all r-subsets of E. Let M be a matroid on E and let N be a matroid on F. We define\nthe direct sum:\n\nM \u2295 N = (E \u00d7 {0} \u222a F \u00d7 {1}, {B \u00d7 {0} \u222a C \u00d7 {1} : B is a base of M and C is a base of N }.\nLet w : E \u2212\u2192 G be a weight function, where G is an abelian group. The weight of a subset\nX is by definition\nX\nXw =\nw(x).\nx\u2208X\n\nThe set of distinct base weights is\nM w = {B w : B is a basis of M }.\nSuppose\nnow |G| = p is a prime number. Schrijver and Seymour proved that |M w | \u2265\nP\nmin(p, g\u2208G r(w\u22121 (g)) \u2212 r(M ) + 1). Let A and B be subsets of G. Define w : A \u00d7 {0} \u222a B \u00d7 {1},\n2\n\n\fby the relation w(x, y) = x. Then\n(U1 (A) \u2295 U1 (B))w = A + B.\nApplying their result to this matroid, Schrijver and Seymour obtained the Cauchy-Davenport\nTheorem.\nLet x1 , . . . , x2p\u22121 \u2208 G. Consider the uniform matroid M = Up (E), of rank p over the set\nE = {1, . . . , 2p \u2212 1}, with weight function w(i) = xi . In order to prove the Erd\u0151s-Ginzburg-Ziv\nTheorem [6], one may clearly assume that no element is repeated p times. In particular for\nevery g \u2208 G, r(w\u22121 (g)) = |w\u22121 (g)|. Applying Schrijver and Seymour to this matroid we have:\nX\nX\n|M w | \u2265 min(|G|,\nr(w\u22121 (g)) \u2212 r(M ) + 1) = min(p,\n|w\u22121 (g)| \u2212 p + 1) = p.\ng\u2208G\n\ng\u2208G\n\nThus Schrijver-Seymour result also implies the Erd\u0151s-Ginzburg-Ziv Theorem [6] in a prime\norder.\nIn the present work, we prove the following result:\nTheorem 1 Let G be a cyclic group, M be a matroid on a finite set E with r(M ) \u2265 1 and let\nw : E \u2212\u2192 G be a weight function. Assume moreover that every non-zero element of w(E)\u2212w(E)\ngenerates G. Then\nX\nr(w\u22121 (g)) \u2212 r(M ) + 1),\n(1)\n|M w | \u2265 min(|G|,\ng\u2208G\n\nwhere M w denotes the set of distinct base weights. Moreover, if Equality holds in (1) then one\nof the following conditions holds:\n(i) r(M ) = 1 or M w is an arithmetic progression.\n(ii) There is a hyperplane H of M such that M w = g + (M/H)w , for some g \u2208 G.\nIf G has a prime order, then the condition on w(E) \u2212 w(E) holds trivially. In this case (1)\nreduces to the result of Schrijver-Seymour.\n\n2\n\nTerminology and Preliminaries\n\nLet M be a matroid on a finite set E. One may see easily from the definitions that all bases a\nmatroid have the same cardinality. A circuit of M is a minimal set not contained in a base.\nA loop is an element x such that {x} is a circuit. By the definition bases contain no loop. The\nclosure of a subset A \u2286 E is by definition\ncl(A) = {x \u2208 A : r(A \u222a x) = r(A)}.\nNote that an element x \u2208 cl(A) if and only if x \u2208 A, or there is circuit C such x \u2208 C and\nC \\ {x} \u2286 A.\n3\n\n\fGiven a matroid M on a set E and a subset A \u2286 E. Then B/A := {J\\A : J is a basis of M with |B\u2229\nA| = r(A)}. One may see easily that M/A = (E \\ A, B/A) is a matroid on E \\ A. We say that\nthis matroid is obtained from M contracting A. Notice that rM/A (X) = rM (X \u222a A) \u2212 rM (A).\nRecall the following easy lemma:\nLemma 2 Let M be a matroid on a finite set E and let U, V be disjoint subsets of E. Then\n\u2022 M/U and M/cl(U ) have the same bases. In particular, (M/U )w = (M/cl(U ))w .\n\u2022 (M/U )/V = M/(U \u222a V ).\nFor more details on matroids, the reader may refer to one of the text books: Welsh [18] or\nWhite [19].\nFor u \u2208 E, we put\nGu := {g \u2208 G : u \u2208 cl(w\u22121 (g))}.\nWe recall the following lemma proved by Schrijver and Seymour in [14]:\nLemma B Let M be a matroid on a finite set E and let w : E \u2212\u2192 G be a weight function.\nThen for every non-loop element u \u2208 E,\n(M/u)w + Gu \u2286 M w .\nProof.\nTake a basis B of M/u and an element g \u2208 Gu . If g = w(u) then, by definition of\ncontraction, B \u222a {u} is a basis of M and B w + w(u) \u2208 M w . If g 6= w(u), there is a circuit C\ncontaining u such that \u2205 =\n6 C \\ {u} \u2286 w\u22121 (g). For some v \u2208 C \\ {u} the subset B \u222a {v} must\nbe a basis of M otherwise C \\ {v} \u2286 cl(B), implying that u \u2208 cl(B), in contradiction with the\nassumption that B is a basis of M/u. Therefore (B \u222a {v})w = B w + g \u2208 M w .\n\n3\n\nProof of the main result\n\nWe shall now prove our result:\nProof of Theorem 1:\nWe first prove (1) by induction on the rank of M . The result holds trivially if r(M ) = 1.\nSince r(M ) \u2265 1, M contains a non-loop element. Take an arbitrary non-loop element y.\n\n|M w | \u2265 |(M/y)w + Gy |\n\u2265 |(M/y)w | + |Gy | \u2212 1\nX\n\u2265\nr(w\u22121 (g)) \u2212 r(M ) + 1.\ng\u2208G\n\n4\n\n(2)\n\n\fThe first inequality follows from Lemma B, the second follows by Theorem A and the third\nis a direct consequence of the definitions of M/u and Gu . This proves the first part of the\ntheorem.\nSuppose now that Equality holds in (1) and that Condition (i) is not satisfied. In particular\nr(M ) \u2265 2. Also |M w | \u2265 2, otherwise M w is a progression, a contradiction.\nWe claim that there exits a non-loop element u \u2208 E such that |(M/u)w | \u2265 2. Assume on\nthe contrary that for every non-loop element u \u2208 E we have |(M/u)w | = 1. Then every pair\nof bases B1 , B2 of M with B1w 6= B2w . satisfies B1 \u2229 B2 = \u2205 otherwise for every z \u2208 B1 \u2229 B2 ,\n|(M/z)w | \u2265 2. Now, for every z \u2208 B1 , there is z \u2032 \u2208 B2 such that C = (B1 \\ {z}) \u222a {z \u2032 } is a\nbase of M. For such a base C, B1 \u2229 C 6= \u2205, B2 \u2229 C 6= \u2205, and we must have B1w = C w = B2w , a\ncontradiction.\nApplying the chain of inequalities proving (2) with y = u. We have\n|M w | = |(M/u)w + Gu | = |(M/u)w | + |Gu | \u2212 1.\n\n(3)\n\nNote that w(E \\ {u}) \u2282 w(E), clearly verifies the Pollard condition. If |Gu | \u2265 2 Theorem A\nimplies that M w is a progression and thus M satisfies Condition (i) of the theorem, contradicting\nour assumption on M . We must have |Gu | = 1.\nThus Gu = {w(u)} and M w = w(u) + (M/u)w .\nSince the translate of a progression is a progression, M/u is not a progression. By Lemma 2,\n(M/u) and M/cl(u) have the same bases and thus the result holds if r(M ) = 2. If r(M ) > 2, then\nby the Induction hypothesis there is a hyperplane H of M/u such that (M/u)w = (M/u/H)w =\n(M/(Cl({u} \u222a H))w , and (ii) holds.\n\nCorollary 3 (Vosper's Theorem [16, 17]) Let p be a prime and let A, B be subsets of Zp such\nthat |A|, |B| \u2265 2.\nIf |A + B| = |A| + |B| \u2212 1 < p then one of the following holds:\n(i) c \u2212 A = (Zp \\ B).\n(ii) A and B are arithmetic progressions with a same difference.\nProof.\nConsider the matroid N = (U1 (A) \u2295 U1 (B)) and its weight function w defined in\nthe Introduction. H = A \u00d7 {0} and H \u2032 = B \u00d7 {1} are the hyperplanes of N and we have\nN w = A + B.\nIf |N w | = |A| + |B| \u2212 1 then Theorem 1 says that N must satisfy one of its conditions (i)\nor (ii). Since by hypothesis |A|, |B| \u2265 2 we have |N w | > max(|A|, |B|) \u2265 |(N/H)w |, |(N/H \u2032 )w |\nand we conclude that N w must be an arithmetic progression with difference d. Without loss of\ngenerality we may take d = 1.\n\n5\n\n\fCase 1. |A + B| = p \u2212 1. Put {c} = Zp \\ (A + B). We have c \u2212 A \u2282 (Zp \\ B). Since these\nsets have the same cardinality we have c \u2212 A = (Zp \\ B).\nCase 2. |A + B| < p \u2212 1.\nWe have |A + B + {0, 1}| = |A + B| + 1 = |A| + |B| < p.\nWe must have |A + {0, 1}| = |A| + 1, since otherwise by the Cauchy-Davenport Theorem,\n\n|A + B| + 1 = |A + B + {0, 1}|\n= |A + {0, 1} + B|\n\u2265 (|A| + 2) + |B| \u2212 1 = |A| + |B| + 1,\na contradiction. It follows that A is an arithmetic progression with difference 1. Similarly B is\nan arithmetic progression with difference 1.\n\nReferences\n[1] Caro, Yair Zero-sum problems, a survey.
