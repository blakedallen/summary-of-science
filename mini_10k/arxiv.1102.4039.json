However, with the development of\nmolecular technology, and with improvements in captive\nbreeding, there are new opportunities to investigate many\naspects of taxonomy that have hitherto remained\nimpossible.\n\nAgalychnis: Agalychnis annae and Agalychnis moreletii\nThere are currently 14 recognized species of Leaf frogs\nbelonging to the genus Agalychnis: Agalychnis annae\n(Duellman, 1963); Agalychnis aspera (Peters, 1873);\nAgalychnis buckleyi (Boulenger, 1882); Agalychnis\ncallidryas (Cope, 1862); Agalychnis dacnicolor (Cope,\n1864); Agalychnis danieli (Ru\u00edz-Carranza, HernandezCamacho and Rueda-Almonacid, 1988); Agalychnis\ngranulosa (Cruz, 1989); Agalychnis hulli (Duellman and\nMendleson, 1995); Agalychnis lemur (Boulenger, 1882);\nAgalychnis medinae (Funkhouser, 1962); Agalychnis\nmoreletti (Dumeril, 1853); Agalychnis psilopygion\n(Cannatella, 1980); Agalychnis saltator (Taylor, 1955);\nAgalychnis spurrelli (Boulenger, 1913). Of these, 3 species\n\nare currently classified as being Endangered or Critically\nEndangered: Agalychnis moreletii, Agalychnis annae, and\nAgalychnis lemur. All species of Agalychnis share common\ncharacteristics of the genus, and each has distinct\nmorphological features on which it was originally\ndescribed. These features include the amount of webbing\nbetween the toes, distinctive colourations of the hands and\nfeet, flanks, and irises, the presence or absence of\nreticulated palpebral membranes, and also several\nosteological differences. Recent revision has led to the\ninclusion of the Genus Pachymedusa, and also Hylomantis,\nnow being considered paraphyletic and the synonymy of\nAgalychnis (Faivovich, et al., 2010). Agalychnis litodryas,\nwhich was originally described from one specimen, is now\nbeen considered a synonym of Agalychnis spurrelii (OrtegaAndrade, 2008; Faivovich, et al., 2010).\nAlthough the range of certain species, such as\nAgalychnis callidryas, is extensive (Mexico to Panama), the\ndistribution of other species is extremely limited and\ngeographically separate. For example, until recently A.\nannae was considered to be endemic to the highlands of\nCosta Rica (Savage, 2002). The holotype originated from\nTapanti, Cartago Province, Costa Rica, and was originally\ndescribed by Duellman in 1963 as Phyllomedusa annae\n(Duellman, 1963). Until recently all reported locations for\nthe species were in Costa Rica, but the distribution has now\nbeen extended to include the Serrania de Tabasara, westcentral Panama (Hertz, et al., 2011).\n\n\f2\nAnother example, with a quite different geographical\ndistribution to A. annae, is Agalychnis moreletii, a species\nfound in humid montane tropical forests ranging from\nSouthern Mexico to central Guatemala, El Salvador, northwestern Honduras, and Belize (Santos-Barrera et al., 2004).\nThis Agalychnis, which appears to be the ecological\nequivalent to A. annae in Northern Central America\n(Duellman, 1970), differs in its colouration from that\nspecies: A. annae has yellow-orange irises and blue flank\ncolouration; A. moreletii has very dark red irises and no\nblue flank colouration. The difference in colouration was\nused as the main distinctive character for separating the two\nspecies in 1963 (Duellman, 1963). Prior to this, specimens\ncollected in Costa Rica were considered to be Agalychnis\n(Phyllomedusa) moreletii (Taylor, 1952).\nMorphologically, and from an osteological perspective,\nthe two species are extremely similar. The skulls of both A.\nannae and A. moreletii are barely distinguishable when\nseveral specimens of each species of similar age and size\nare compared. Both have skulls that are considerably deeper\nthan any other Agalychnis species and also show the\ngreatest amount of ossification of the sphenoid (Duellman,\n1970). Here it is interesting to note that, prior to any\nmolecular analysis, a cladistic phylogenetic analysis of the\nGenus Agalychnis based on a matrix containing 12\nphenotypic characters revealed five equally parsimonious\ntrees. Out of these, only one clear polytomy emerged: A.\nmoreletii and A. annae (Duellman, 2001). With the\ninclusion of other species in the genus due to recent\nrevisions (and excluding the former A. calcarifer and A.\ncraspedopus, which are both now in the genus Cruziohyla),\nmany of the phenotypic characters have been redefined\n(Faivovich et al., 2010). However, apart from differences in\ncoloration, the two species concerned continue to share the\nsame defining characteristics. When a comprehensive\nmatrix using different characters associated with\nphyllomedusine breeding biology was carried out\n(Faivovich, et. al., 2010), A. annae and A. moreletii shared\nall reproductive characteristics, which in turn separated\nthem from all other Agalychnis species. The characters were\nlarval development in ponds, egg-less capsules absent, leaffolding behavior present, oviposition on leaves, epiphytes,\nand roots. There is little discernable difference in egg clutch\nsize (Gomez-Mestra, et al., 2008), although this can vary\n\nPlate 1. Agalychnis moreletii (Guatemalan specimen) \u00a9 Tobias Eisenburg\n\nconsiderably between Agalychnis species. Further, the\ntadpoles of the two species appear almost indistinguishable,\nparticularly when compared at the same stage of\ndevelopment (personal observation), but they differ\nnoticeably from all other Agalychnis tadpoles by having a\nshorter tail, deeper body, and a protruding snout (Duellman,\n1970).\nIn the past few years the Hylid subfamily\nPhyllomedusinae has been the focus of much phylogenetic\nresearch and recent studies based on molecular analysis\nhave proved extremely valuable in clarifying the taxonomic\nstatus of many species (Kerfoot, 2003, Faivovich et al.,\n2005, Wiens et al., 2005, Moen and Wiens, 2008,\nFaivovich, et al., 2010). A study carried out by Crook\n(2007) at Manchester University as part of her Masters\nDegree used phylogenetic analysis to compare\nmitochondrial 16s and cytochrome b (cytb) gene sequences\nfrom different Phyllomedusine species. This confirmed\nKerfoot's original results (Kerfoot, 2003). The work of\nCrook also supports the hypothesis of Faivovich, et. al.\n(2010) and the recent re-classification that places the\nspecies previously known as Pachymedusa dacnicolor in\nthe Genus Agalychnis (Faivovich, et al, 2010). In 2003,\nKerfoot confirmed the species now known as Cruziohyla\ncalcarifer as being distinctly separate from Agalychnis and\nPhyllomedusa (Kerfoot, 2003). Assessment of the genetic\nrelationship between the species A. annae and A. moreletii\nwas unavailable to him at the time. More recently, however,\ndetailed phylogenetic studies that have included both A.\nannae and A. moreletii have shown that they are more\nclosely related to each other than to any other species in the\ngenus (Gomez-Mestre et al., 2008; Faivovich, et al., 2010).\nFurther, the study by Crook (2007) indicated that A. annae\nand A. moreletii provided branch lengths separating the\nspecies of just 0.047 and 0.029 (Crook, 2007: Figure 1),\ncomparable to the variation between distinct populations of\nAgalychnis lemur from Costa Rica and Panama, which are\ncurrently classified as the same species.\nFollowing this genetic assessment, and to investigate\ngenetic compatibility, a crossbreeding experiment between\nthe two species was carried out at Manchester Museum in\n2010 in which unassisted hybridization between specimens\nof and A. moreletii from Guatemala (Plate 1) and A. annae\nfrom Costa Rica (Plate 2) was achieved.\n\nPlate 2.

Values represent the number of substitutions for site for that lineage (Redrawn from Crook, 2007).\n\nThe Hybrid:\nStructurally, and from an osteological perspective, the hybrid\nof A. annae and A. moreletii is barely distinguishable from\neither parental species. This is to be expected, as they\nthemselves are structurally extremely similar. The parent\nspecies share characteristics that separate them from other\nspecies of the genus Agalychnis: a very small bone called the\nsquamosal is in narrow contact with the crista parotica; the\ncloacal sheath is long and directed ventrally; the iris is red or\nyellow/orange. The hybrid of A. annae and A. moreletii is no\ndifferent in this respect. The hybrid exhibits colouration\ncharacteristics of both species: the iris colouration is very\ndark red, most like A. moreletii, and the flanks and thighs\nhave purple to blue coloration, most like A. annae. However,\nunlike the extensive blue colouration of the flank markings\nseen in A. annae, the purplish-blue in the hybrid forms a\nnarrow band between the green dorsal coloration and the\nwhite underside (Plate 3). A purplish hue also extends along\nthe external edging of the arms and legs. The hands and feet\nare orange, and this is more intense than was seen in either\nparent. At the time of writing, the hybrid is being maintained\nin captivity, and the final adult size is so far unknown.\n\nPlate 3. A hybrid of Agalychnis moreletii/Agalychnis annae (D1285).\n\u00a9 Andrew R. Gray, The Manchester Museum.\n\n\f4\n\nDiscussion\nHybridization experiments with amphibians have proved\nparticularly useful in providing evidence for the inheritance\nof genes, including certain colour pattern traits (Duellman\n& Trueb, 1986). The cross mating of A. annae and A\nmoreletii produced a hybrid with purplish-blue flank and\nthigh markings, a feature normally associated with A. annae\n(Kubicki, 2004). The hybrid also has a very dark red iris, a\nfeature of A. moreletti (McCranie and Wilson, 2002). The\nspecies concerned in this study are allopatric, but natural\ncrossbreeding in closely related sympatric species belonging\nto the subfamily Phyllomedusinae has shown that the\nhybrids generally do have intermediate colour patterns\n(Haddad, et al., 1994).\nAt the time of writing, the hybrid is not fully grown, but\nit is expected to attain a size similar to its parents; females\nof both species reach a similar size, although there seems to\nbe some differences in the extent of sexual dimorphism. The\noriginal 40 male specimens of A. annae, collected from\nCartago Province, Costa Rica, by Edward Taylor on\n26th/27th August 1947 as A. moreletii, are now held in\ndifferent museums (eg. 26 specimens are held in The Field\nMuseum and 15 specimens in Kansas University Museum).\nIn his work relating to the specimens collected, Taylor\nstated that the males attained 54-55mm SVL, and seem\nsmaller that Mexican A. moreletii (Taylor, 1952). Larger\nmale specimens and females of A. annae have since been\nfound, including those also collected from Cartago as types\nin 1961. In the description of A. annae by Duellman (1963),\nthe written sizes of 35 male A. annae specimens are given\nas being 55.9 - 65.7mm SVL, along with 5 female\nspecimens having snout-vent lengths of 81.6 - 84.2mm\n(Holotype and paratypes of A. annae at Kansas University\ntotal 40 (KU 64020-64060). However, there appears to have\nbeen some confusion in Duellman's paper concerning sizes\nand the comparison of A. annae with A. moreletii: the sizes\ngiven in the text for the 35 male A. annae specimens appear\nin the comparison table under the 25 male A. moreletii, and\nsizes reaching 73.9mm appear for the A. annae males. It has\nsince been confirmed that male A. annae specimens do\nreach such a large size: 75mm in SVL and females 85mm\nSVL (Arguedas, 2010). To date, male A. moreletii are\nknown to reach 66 mm SVL (Briggs, 2010) and females\n85 mm SVL (Lee, 1996).\nHylid species are recognised to have great differences in\nsize, iris colouration, and flank colouration and pattern\n(Duellman, 1970). Within Agalychnis, there is a great\namount of variation in flank markings in A. callidryas, a\nspecies that occurs from Mexico to Panama. Depending on\nthe geographical locality of the population, the colouration\nof the flanks, thighs, and concealed surfaces in this species\ncan vary from blue to orange (Robertson and Zamudio,\n2009). The colouration of the flanks, thighs, and concealed\nsurfaces (including hands and feet) from different A.\n\nmoreletii populations also varies geographically; little or no\norange colouration in specimens from areas in Guatemala\n(Plate 1) and areas of neighboring El Salvador (Plate 4),\norange in specimens from areas of Mexico (Lee, 1996),\nvivid orange in specimens from areas of Belize (Briggs,\n2010: Plate 5). In A. annae from Costa Rica the flanks and\nposterior part of the thighs are purplish-blue (Kubicki,\n2004) (Plate 2). Although little is currently known about the\nA. annae population occurring in west-central Panama, the\ninitial specimen found has purplish-blue colouration to the\nflanks and thighs. However, the specimen also has a\ncovering of distinctly raised white-coloured pustules on the\ndorsal surface, most similar in structure to those seen in\nsome specimens of Agalychnis dacnicolor from Mexico\n(personal observation of A. dacniolor and assessment of\nphotograph of Panamanian A. annae taken by A. Hertz: see\nHertz, et al., 2011). A. annae specimens from Costa Rica do\nnot have these white pustular spots, and are characterized by\nhaving a smooth dorsal surface (Savage, 2002), which is\npale green and shows little variation (Duellman, 1963).\nInterestingly, having a scattering of white flecks on the\ndorsum is a distinctive feature of A. moreletii specimens\nfrom some populations, including those from Honduras\n(Duellman, 1970).\nIn some other groups of neotropical frogs, such as those\nbelonging to the Dendrobatidae Genus Oophaga, the most\nextreme polymorphism in patterning and colour can be\nseen. In some species, such as Oophaga pumilio, specimens\nfrom different geographically separated localities range in\ncolour from bright red, orange, yellow, to green (Daly and\nMyers, 1967). In this species, which occurs from Nicaragua\nto Panama, some specimens from Costa Rica have solid\nblue markings on their legs (Savage, 2002). In the\npopulation of frogs from Tierra Ocsura, Panama, almost\ncompletely blue specimens occur (Hagemann and Prohl,\n2007). The blue skin of the O. pumilio lacks the\nxanthophore layer (Frost-Mason, et al, 1972). The same\nskin pigment layer loss is responsible for the blue\ncolouration seen in A. annae.\nSeveral factors are considered to be responsible for\nphenotypic variation in amphibians, including natural and\nsexual selection, geographical isolation, and genetic drift\n(Wang and Shaffer, 2008). However, until recently,\nphenotypic variation is an aspect of amphibian evolutionary\nbiology that has remained extremely understudied. Several\nhypotheses regarding causes of phenotypic variation have\nrecently been tested, and in the brightly coloured diurnal\ndart frog species O. pumilio, the hypothesis of colour\npattern divergence being due to isolation by distance\n(Wright, 1943) has been rejected in favour of one\nsupporting divergent selection, and reproductive isolation\nbeing responsible for producing differently coloured\npopulations (Wang & Summers, 2010). Although female\nchoice in dart frogs may be based on aposematic\n\n\f5\ncolouration (Maan & Cummings, 2008), other recent studies\nfocusing on more cryptic and nocturnally active Central\nAmerican neotropical frog species, such as Physalaemus\npustulosus, show both reproductive isolation through\ndistance and time of divergence between populations as\nfactors accounting for differences in the genetic structure of\npopulations (Pr\u00f6hl, et al., 2010). However, it should be\nemphasised that reproductive behaviour of many\nneotropical frogs is very different than that of dendrobatids,\nwhere territoriality of males and female mate choice may\nplay a more important role in their reproduction (Stebbins\nand Cohen, 1995).\nAgalychnis frogs are known for their cryptic colouration\nwhen at rest, and extremely bright colouration when active\n(Gray and Drury, 2004). Such brightly coloured flash\nmarking in phyllomedusines are used to avoid predation\n(Duellman and Trueb, 1986). However, males are known to\nuse their flank and leg colourations when visual signaling,\nas when body posturing and leg-waving in conspecific\nterritorial communication (Gray, 2002). Recent studies have\nshown that, rather than genetic drift, both localized selection\nand geographic barriers contribute to colour divergence\namong Agalychnis populations (Robertson and Zamudio,\n2009). Duellman suggests that A. annae and A. moreletti\nprobably evolved from their ancestral stock as a result of\ngeographical isolation, correlated with the elevation of the\nTalamanca mountain range in lower Central America and\nthe highlands of nuclear Central America. (Duellman,\n2001).\nWithin Agalchnis, several species stand out as having\nevolved to inhabit high mountains: Agalychnis moreletti\n(450-2000m); Agalychnis annae (780-1,650m); Agalychnis\nlemur (440-1,600m) (Duellman, 2001; Savage, 2002).\nWithin the genus these are the species that are considered to\nbe the most at risk of becoming extinct, as reflected in their\ncurrent conservation status: A. moreletii and A. lemur are\nboth classified as Critically Endangered and A. annae as\nEndangered on the IUCN Red Data List. Over the past 30\nyears, populations of all three species have completely\ndisappeared from areas where they were once common,\nparticularly in the highlands of Central America where\n\nPlate 4. Agalychnis moreletii , El Imposible National Park,\nWestern El Salvador. \u00a9 Tyler Lawson; Lawson et al., (2011).\n\ncooler temperatures and Chytridiomycosis caused by the\nfungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis both appear to have\nplayed their part in their demise (Pounds et al., 2006; Lips,\n2006). Surveys have indicated that A. moreletii has now\ncompletely disappeared from several areas where it was\nonce abundant, particularly in Honduras, and also Mexico\n(Lips, et al 2004). What remains of the Costa Rican\npopulation of A. annae now only survives in small pockets\nat the lower altitudes of its former range, in the Central\nValley and around the Capital, San Jose (Pounds, et al.,\n2008). The same is true for A. lemur, where the Costa Rican\npopulations are now known from just 2 or 3 sites.\nIt is likely that specific environmental conditions in the\nareas where remaining populations survive contribute to the\nspecies' current preservation, and that local temperature and\nhumidity levels, driven by precipitation and sunlight, are\nimportant in their resistance to the chytrid. As Robertson\nand Zamudio (2009) proposed, dispersal barriers and\ngeographical separation have probably brought about the\ngenetic and phenotypic divergence in Agalychnis frogs\n(Robertson and Zamudio, 2009). Presumably, these same\nbarriers are also partly responsible for protecting individual\npopulations from environmentally associated threats. It\nfollows that individual populations that have had the\nopportunity to adapt to favourable conditions may be at less\nrisk than others, heightening the importance of identifying\ndifferences in populations in relation to conservation efforts.\nThere is also real concern that certain populations may\ndisappear before their distinctiveness has even been\nestablished.\nA measurement to complement the species concept was\ndeveloped some time ago in an effort to assist such\nconservation, the \"evolutionary significant unit\" (ESU). An\nESU is 'A defined population that is considered\nmorphologically and genetically different from related\nESU's, caused by either past restriction of gene flow,\nlocally adapted phenotypic traits, or current geographical\nseparation' (Connor and Hartl, 2004). If populations are\nconsidered to be ESU's, it is generally agreed that they\nshould be treated separately for the purposes of\nconservation (Ryder, 1986).\n\nPlate 5. Agalychnis moreletii , Las Cuavas, Chiquibul Forest Reserve,\nBelize. \u00a9 Venetia Briggs; Briggs (2010).\n\n\f6\nConclusion\n\nReferences\n\nCrossbreeding has shown that the non-sympatric species\nAgalychnis annae and Agalychnis moreletti are extremely\nclosely related. However, they should continue to be\nconsidered as separate, both as allopatric taxa and for\nconservation purposes. It is also important to recognize the\nlevels of similarity observed in distinct populations of other\nclosely related species, such as Agalychnis lemur from\nCosta Rica and Panama: if conservation is of main\nimportance, it follows that the separate populations of\nA.lemur should also be conserved for the future as distinct\nentities.\nFuture studies should also focus on assessing the levels\nof variation between different populations of the same\nspecies. Extensive research has already begun in this area,\nsuch as the detailed work by Pr\u00f6hl, et al., (2010) with the\nneotropical frog Physalaemus pustulosus, and by Robertson\nand Zamudio (2009) with A. callidryas. Focusing on an\nendangered species would add real conservation value.\nSuggested future research relating to some of the issues\nhighlighted in this work might include determining levels of\ngeographic variation and genetic diversification in A.\nmoreletii from countries where they show significant\ncontrast in colour, comparing the newly discovered\npopulation of A. annae in Panama with those from Costa\nRica, and investigation of the individuality of A. lemur\npopulations. Whatever action is felt most appropriate, more\nimportance should be placed on sampling specimens from\nthroughout the species' distribution to assist further status\nand conservation assessments. As phylogenetic assessment\nopportunities develop, agreement from within the scientific\ncommunity on standardization of the level of genetic\ndivergence required to define an amphibian 'ESU' would be\nhighly beneficial to taxonomists and conservation biologists\nalike.\nAlthough crossbreeding experiments can provide much\nuseful information, the author recognizes the ethical\nconsiderations involved. This work was carried out under\ncontrolled conditions, and as a one-off for the benefit of the\nscientific discipline. It is hoped that these notes will provide\nuseful information to others concerned with furthering our\nknowledge of amphibian phylogenetics and those working\nto conserve all the endangered species discussed.\n\nArguedas, V.
