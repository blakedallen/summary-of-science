Especially, recent progress in crystal growth techniques makes it possible to fabricate and control several classes of oxide heterojunctions. Since Ohotomo et al. found interfacespecific conducting states between two different insulating perovskite transition-metal oxides1,2 , one of the\nmain interests has been directed toward the electronic\nproperties near the hetero-interface, drastically varying\nwith respect to the bulk components. One of the bestknown examples is the LaAlO3 /SrTiO3 heterostructure.\nAlthough both LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 are conventional\nband-insulators, recent experiments have revealed twodimensional superconductivity3 , ferromagnetic correlation4 and even the coexistences of the two states at ntype polar interfaces5,6 . These phases exhibit a distinct\ndependence on film-thickness and growth-condition4,7\nand an intriguing electric-field response8,9 . Furthermore,\nhigh carrier-mobility at the interface2,10\u201312 and twodimensional superconductivity13,14 have been reported\nfor LaTiO3 (LTO)/SrTiO3 (STO) heterostructures.\nMotivated by these experimental findings, many theoretical approaches have been proposed to describe the nature of quasi two-dimensional electron systems localized\naround the interface15\u201320 . Particularly the LTO/STO interface has been extensively investigated due to the chemical similarity and small mismatch of lattice constants between perovskite compounds LTO and STO21 . Okamoto\nand Millis analyzed a generalized Hubbard model in the\nframework of Hartree-Fock approximation21,22 and dynamical mean field theory (DMFT)23,24 . The origin of\nmetallic behavior at the LTO/STO interface has been\nclarified, and, moreover, possible ferromagnetic and an-\n\ntiferromagnetic phases have been investigated, also in relation to orbital ordering21 and their temperature dependence24 . First principles calculations have been also\nperformed to explore the role of the lattice reconstruction, and demonstrated several spin and charge ordered\nphases25,26 as well as the effects of lattice relaxation10 ,\nwhich modify the interface electronic structure. Moreover, R\u00fcegg et al examined the electronic and thermoelectric transport properties, particularly focusing on the\ncharacters of quasi-particles in the inhomogeneous layered system27 .\nIn this paper, we present a theoretical study of electronic and magnetic properties in correlated heterostructures of the Mott-insulator (MI) embedded between two\nband insulators (BI), such as STO/LTO/STO structures. A sketch of our model system is shown in Fig. 1.\nAccording to the previous optical and photoemission\nstudies, LTO/STO heterojunction develops a quasi-twodimensional electron gas extended only a few unit-cells\nacross the interface. As mentioned in Ref. 28, however,\nsome experimental setups may allow us to tune the dimensionality of the interface electron system. Therefore, reflecting the broadness of the conducting electronic state, the possible d band occupation would vary\nabruptly or gradually from n = 1 (d1 ) at LTO to n = 0\n(d0 ) at STO region beyond the interface if the thickness\nof the heterostructure along the stacking direction is large\nenough to reproduce bulk properties in each region. Such\nsharpness of the spatially changing electron density might\neven modify the electronic structure only near the interface.\nHere we shed light on the nature of the electronic state\naround the hetero-interface with particular emphasis on\nthe interplay of charge distribution and magnetic properties. As mentioned above, we consider a BI/MI/BI\nheterostructure, taking the example of a LTO/STO heterostructure. For simplicity, we assume perfect matching\n\n\f2\n\nBI\n\nMI\n\nBI\n\nx, y\nN\n\nz\nFIG. 1: Schematic view of the BI/MI/BI-type [001] heterostructure defined by N layers of positively charged cations.\nWe choose the z-axis along [001] direction. Black sites at\n~ i = a(li , mi , ni ) correspond to the B sites of perovskite\nR\nABO3 and A\u2032 BO3 lattices, where the relevant conduction\n~ iion =\nelectrons reside. The A and A\u2032 ions located at R\na(li + 1/2, mi + 1/2, ni + 1/2) are replaced by +1 and neutral\ncounter-ions, respectively.\n\nof the two lattices and, thus, only focus on the electronic\nreconstruction based on the mobile electrons in the Tiderived band. The corresponding model heterostructure\nis described by the generalized Hubbard model defined in\nRef. 21. Here our focus is put on the competition of spin\nand charge degrees of freedom while neglecting the orbital degeneracy of Ti-3d band. We treat on-site interaction with the Hartree-Fock approximation, and calculate\nthe ground state phase diagram as a function of the local\nand long-range Coulomb interaction. We obtain a variety of the interface-specific magnetic and charge-ordered\nphases. We find that the intimate spin-charge coupling\nin magnetic fields causes a first-order metamagnetic transition as well as a reentrant charge-ordering transition.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the model and method employed in this study.\nIn Sec. III we discuss the T = 0 phase diagram obtained\nas a function of local and long-ranged Coulomb interactions, and provide detailed studies of some ordered phases\nspecific to the interface. Sec. IV presents the effects of\nexternal magnetic fields, and clarifies the origin of fieldinduced spin and charge transitions. Finally, a brief summary is given in Sec. V.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL\n\nWe study a BI/MI/BI-type heterostructure based on\nthe [001] stacking of d1 Mott insulator ABO3 and d0 band\ninsulator A\u2032 BO3 with cubic perovskite lattice structures;\nhereafter we choose the z axis along the [001] direction.\nTaking an example of LTO/STO multilayer structure, A\n(A\u2032 ) ions represent a valence of +2 (+3) charged cation,\nand mobile conduction electrons reside on the B ions\nwhich are common constituents for ABO3 and A\u2032 BO3 .\nA schematic view of this system is illustrated in Fig. 1.\nWe assume the chemical similarity and perfect lattice\n\nmatch between two cubic perovskite components. Therefore, simulating the different valences between A and A\u2032\nions, we define the model heterostructure via N counterion layers with a positive charge +e sitting in the Mottinsulating material; A3+ and A\u20322+ cations are here substituted with +1 and neutral point charges, respectively21 .\nHence, in addition to the repulsive electron-electron interaction, electrons suffer from the electrostatic potential\nof the positively charged ions placed between electrically\nactive B sites. The charge neutral condition requires\nthat the total number of these electrons equals to that of\n+1-charged A site ions. In the present work, the corresponding microscopic model is simplified with disregarding orbital degeneracy of B ions, which are sometimes associated with interesting phenomena in transition-metal\noxides. Thus, this model heterostructure captures the\nessential aspects of the competition between spin and\ncharge degrees of freedom in a spatially non-uniform environment.\nTo describe electron dynamics in the background of\nthe non-uniform attractive potential, we introduce the\ngeneralized Hubbard model given by,\nH = Hband + Hee + Hei .\n\n(1)\n\nHere, the kinetic term Hband is presented by the single\nband tight-binding model,\nX\n(c\u2020i\u03c3 cj\u03c3 + h.c.),\n(2)\nHband = \u2212t\n<i,j>,\u03c3\n\nwhere ci\u03c3 is an annihilation operator of an electron with\n~i =\nspin \u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193 at the site labeled by index i as R\na(li , mi , ni ) with lattice constant a. Electron hopping\nwith the transfer integral t is limited between the nearestneighbor sites on the square lattice. Hee and Hei correspond to electron-electron and electron-ion Coulomb interaction given by,\nHee = U\n\nX\ni\n\nHei = \u2212\n\nX\nij,\u03c3\n\nn\u0302i\u2191 n\u0302i\u2193 +\n\n1\n2\n\nX\ni6=j,\u03c3,\u03c3\u2032\n\ne2 n\u0302i\u03c3\n,\n~i \u2212 R\n~ ion |\n\u01eb|R\n\ne2 n\u0302i\u03c3 n\u0302j\u03c3\u2032\n,\n~i \u2212 R\n~ j|\n\u01eb|R\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nj\n\nwhere ni\u03c3 = c\u2020i\u03c3 ci\u03c3 is the spin dependent occupation\n~ ion = a(li + 1/2, mi + 1/2, ni + 1/2) specnumber, and R\ni\nifies a position of the cation. Both the electron-electron\nrepulsion and the electron-ion attraction are introduced\nas a long-ranged Coulomb interaction whose characteristic energy scale is given by the coefficient Ec = e2 /a\u01eb\nwith the dielectric constant \u01eb of the host lattice. In\nEq. (3), the strong on-site repulsion between electrons\nis considered via an ordinary Hubbard interaction term\nwith magnitude U . Note that the strength of the on-site\ninteraction has the same value on all B sites throughout the heterostructure, i. e. the spatial inhomogeneity\nof this model is characterized by the Hei term. Therefore, it is naturally assumed that the electron density\n\n\f3\nprofile is mainly determined by these long-range interactions. On the one hand, the broad charge distribution,\nextended into the band-insulating material, is favored in\norder to suppress repulsive electron-electron interaction\nHee , but on the other hand, the attractive electrostatic\npotential Hei confines the conduction electrons in the\nMott-insulating region.\nWe also take the effects of external magnetic fields into\naccount to give a systematical study of the magnetism in\nthe inhomogeneous system. In the current study, the\nmagnetic fields are treated through the Zeeman term.\nX\n1\nHZ = \u2212 g\u03bcB H\nmiz ,\n(5)\n2\ni\nwhere g and \u03bcB indicate the electron g-factor and the\nBohr magneton, respectively, and miz = ni\u2191 \u2212 ni\u2193 is a\nmagnetization along the applied magnetic fields. Hereafter, the applied magnetic fields are measured in units\nof 21 g\u03bcB .\nThe ground state phases are governed essentially by\nthree parameters: thickness of positive ion layers N , onsite Hubbard U and the coupling constant of long-range\nCoulomb interaction Ec . As mentioned in Ref. 21, for the\nexample of the experimentally fabricated LTO/STO heterostructure substantial uncertainties exist in estimating\nthe realistic values of U and Ec except for an experimentally tunable parameter N . Particularly the dielectric constant \u01eb = e2 /aEc in bulk STO samples strongly\ndepends on temperature29,30 and electric fields31 , and\ncan even change its value by more than one order of\nmagnitude as a function of these quantities. Therefore,\nin addition to N , discussions on the role of U and Ec\nmay be important to gain physical insights into the electronic and magnetic properties of realistic heterostructures, particularly into the interplay of spin and charge\ndegrees of freedom. However, a systematic and exact\ncomputational study of the model Hamiltonian [Eq. (1)]\nover a wide range of parameters is practically excluded.\nHence, in the current study, the on-site repulsion and\nlong-range Coulomb interaction are treated by employing unrestricted Hartree-Fock and Hartree approximation, respectively. Here, for the derivation of the effective single-particle\nHamiltonian, the on-site Hubbard\nP\nterm U i ni\u2191 ni\u2193 in Eq. (3) decoupled as follows,\nHF\n\nni\u2191 ni\u2193 \u2212\u2192 n\u0302i\u2191 hn\u0302i\u2193 i + hn\u0302i\u2191 in\u0302i\u2193 \u2212 hn\u0302i\u2191 ihn\u0302i\u2193 i\n\u2212 hc\u2020i\u2191 ci\u2193 ic\u2020i\u2193 ci\u2191 \u2212 c\u2020i\u2191 ci\u2193 hc\u2020i\u2193 ci\u2191 i\n+ hc\u2020i\u2191 ci\u2193 ihc\u2020i\u2193 ci\u2191 i\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the site-dependent expectation values h. . . i are calculated self-consistently. However, not only the energetically most favorable state, several self-consistent solutions are typically allowed in mean-field treatments. We\nthus consider a variety of ordered states allowed up to\ntwo sublattices and select the one with the lowest energy\nafter many iteration steps of O(103 ). As compared to\nother many-body methods such as dynamical mean field\n\ntheory, the Hartree-Fock treatment treats electron correlation effects only with limitations. We, however, believe\nthat the approximation captures the qualitatively correct tendency towards certain electron correlations, while\noverestimating the realization of actual order.\nIn the following, we restrict our investigation to the\nphysically relevant parameter regime U > Ec at zero\ntemperature. We consider a supercell geometry of about\n25-layers structure including N cation planes, and employ open boundary conditions for solving the mean-field\nHamiltonian. Since electrons are well confined within\nthis multi-layer structure for all the parameter values\nconsidered in our study, the boundary condition would\nnot change the quantitative aspects of our present calculation.\n\nIII.\n\nPHASE DIAGRAM\n\nIn order to gain insights into the electronic and magnetic properties, we first discuss the ground-state phase\ndiagram. In this section, we fix the external magnetic\nfield to zero and investigate possible phases in the U -Ec\nplane. As pointed out by previous studies21,32 , the profile of the charge distribution is sensitive to the energy\nscale of long-range Coulomb interaction Ec . At small\nEc , electrons are extended to the band-insulating region\ndue to the weak attractive potential of cation layers, and\nthe electron density profile gradually varies from n \u2243 1\n(MI) to n \u2243 0 (BI) across the interface. In contrast, electrons are strongly confined along the z direction for large\nEc , and a more abrupt change of charge distribution is\nobserved in the vicinity of the interface. To characterize this \"sharpness\" in the charge distribution around\nthe interface, we introduce a Thomas-Fermipscreening\nlength which roughly corresponds to \u03bbT F \u223c t/Ec a27 .\nWith this value, we can distinguish between \"broad\"\nand \"abrupt\" variations of the charge distribution via\n\u03bbT F < a and \u03bbT F > a, for which the positive electrostatic potential confines mobile electrons between the insulating regions. We expect that the electronic and magnetic phases near the interface are sensitive to the electron density profile, and change their character around\n\u03bbT F \u2243 a. Similar insights have been also given in the\npreceding studies using double exchange 32 and HolsteinHubbard model33 .\nWe investigate possible in-plane magnetic and charge\nordered states with a two-sublattice structure. DMFT\ncalculations performed by Okamoto and Millis24 showed\nthat a ferromagnetic ordering is favored in the vicinity\nof the interface in the large U regime. Therefore, besides\nthe conventional paramagnetic (PM), ferromagnetic (F)\nand antiferromagnetic (AF) states, we allow for a spatial\nmodulation of the magnetic moment. Along the z-axis,\na possible magnetic state can vary smoothly from the\nAF state in the Mott-insulating region to the FM state\naround the interface. We search for the favorable direction of the FM moment relative to that of the AF mo-\n\n\f4\n\nU=Ec\n\nPMCO\nCO-GAF\nGAF\nCA-GAF\nPMM\n\nAAF\n\nFIG. 2: Ground-state phase diagram as a function of the onsite repulsion U and long-range Coulomb interaction Ec . The\nnumber of the counter-ion layers is N = 4. Our focus is put\non the physically relevant regime, U > Ec . Six phases are\nshown: paramagnetic metallic state (PMM), paramagnetic\ncharge ordered state (PMCO), antiferromagnetic state with\n(\u03c0, \u03c0, \u03c0) spin configuration (GAF), (0, 0, \u03c0)-type antiferromagnetic state (AAF), GAF state with canted antiferromagnetic state at the interface (CA-GAF) and GAF state with\ncheckerboard charge-ordering at the interface (CO-GAF). The\nsolid and broken lines indicate the first- and second-order\ntransitions, respectively.\n\nment. In addition, although a simple cubic lattice with\nband filling \u2243 1 prefers the G-type AF (GAF) ordering\nshowing (\u03c0, \u03c0, \u03c0) spin configuration particularly in the\nN \u2192 \u221e limit, the strong spatial inhomogeneity in the\ncharge density profile may induce a uniaxial distortion\nfor the possible spin alignment in the z-direction. Hence,\nas trial magnetic states in the Mott-insulating region, we\nfurther take into account the A-type AF (AAF) and Ctype AF (CAF) structure having the (0, 0, \u03c0) and (\u03c0, \u03c0, 0)\nspin orderings, respectively.\nFig. 2 presents the calculated phase diagram for an\nN = 4 layer structure with counter-ions at z = \u00b11.5 and\nz = \u00b10.5. To obtain the phase diagram, we compare\nthe energies of several different ordered phases and select the one with the lowest energy. Six phases are found\nwithin the current mean-field analysis: PM metallic state\n(PMM), PM charge ordered (CO) state with checkerboard pattern (PMCO), GAF state, AAF state, canted\nAF state around the interface accompanied with GAF\nordering in Mott-insulating region (CA-GAF), and ferromagnetic checkerboard CO state at the interface plane\nwith GAF ordering for Mott-insulating side (CO-GAF).\nThe phase boundaries, represented by the solid (broken)\nlines, correspond to the first-(second-) order phase transitions. In order to examine the role of the counter-ion\nlayer thickness N , the thicker heterostructure, involving\nN = 10 positive layers, is also investigated. The corresponding phase diagram is, however, analogous to the\nN = 4 case apart from the AAF state, which is absent\n\nin the case of N = 10. This type of N -dependence is\nfurther discussed in Sec. III A.\nIntriguingly, the charge (magnetic) properties in the\nmean-field phase diagram are dramatically changed\naround Ec /t \u2243 1 (U/t \u2243 3). Let us first focus on the\nsmall Ec regime (weak confinement regime \u03bbT F > a). At\nsmall U the possible ground state is PMM. With increasing U , this state undergoes a continuous phase transition\nto the GAF state, whose behavior is in good agreement\nwith Ref. 24; in spite of the lower occupancy n \u2243 0.4,\nthe finite AF moment, aligned in the same direction as\nthat of the neighboring layers, is observed at the interface\nlayer (see also Fig. 3). Note that this GAF state is stabilized in the whole Ec region at intermediate U . When\nU is further increased, we encounter a distinct magnetic\nphase: a ferromagnetic component of the magnetization\nspontaneously arises around the hetero-interface, giving\nrise to a tilt of the AF moment. We, thus, arrive at\nthe CA-GAF phase, although AAF states are still stable under certain conditions. The detailed study for the\nCA-GAF state is given in Sec. III A.\nOn the other hand, the charge sector exhibits quite\ndifferent properties for Ec /t > 1 (\u03bbT F < a). In this case,\nthe PMCO state is stabilized in the small-U region, which\nturns into the GAF state around U/t \u2243 3 via a first-order\ntransition. Here, the charge-ordering is realized in the\nwhole Mott-insulating region. We naturally expect that\nthe PMCO state is stabilized by the long-range Coulomb\ninteraction34 . For the large U region, we propose another\ninteresting mechanism to stabilize the charge ordering\nin the CO-GAF phase, which will be addressed later in\nSec. III B.\nIn the following subsections, we give a more detailed\ndiscussions on the phase diagram with particular emphasis on the two remarkable phases realized in the large U\nregion: the canted antiferromagnetic state and the charge\nordered state.\n\nA.\n\nCanted Antiferromagnetic state for Ec /t < 1\n\nWe start with discussions on the possible ordered states\nfor Ec /t < 1 (\u03bbT F > a). In this case, the weak attractive potential makes the conduction electron deeply\npenetrate into the band-insulating region, and, thus, the\ncharge distribution near the interface is relatively sensitive to the values of Ec . Hence, the electronic phases for\nEc /t < 1 would be connected with the spatial variation\nof the charge distribution through the band-filling dependence of the typical bulk phases35,36 . In this regime,\nwe find three phases which are common to N = 4 and\nN = 10: PMM, GAF and CA-GAF states. Among them,\nthe most salient phase we found is the CA-GAF state, because there is no analog in the bulk phase diagram35,37 .\nThis state is defined by the z-axis modulation of the antiferromagnetic spin alignment; around the interface, the\nalternating up and down spins are both tilted in the same\ndirection, and, thus, a ferromagnetic moment perpendic-\n\n\f5\n1.0\n\nA\u03c3\u03c3 (z, \u03c9)\n\nn, m, mstag\n\n0.5\n\nn\nmstag\nm\n\nU/t = 12\nEc/t=0.8\n\n0.0\n\n-0.5\n\n-1.0\n\nBI\n-10\n\nMI\n-5\n\n0\n\nBI\n5\n\n10\n\nz\nFIG. 3: Layer-dependent electron density (filled square), magnetization (open circle) and staggered magnetization (filled\ncircle) for the parameters U/t = 12, Ec /t = 0.8, and N = 10.\nCounter-ions are placed at z = \u00b10.5, \u00b11.5, * * * \u00b1 4.5. The interface layers are located at z = \u00b15, separating Mott- and\nband- insulator regions.\n\nular to the AF moment emerges. To obtain the above\nsolution we consider the two kinds of the phases accompanied with finite magnetization around the interface,\nwhich are distinguished by the angle between the direction of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic moment:\nperpendicular or parallel. With the energetic comparison, we find the solution with perpendicular one is favorable, and therefore the interplay of the F and AF orderings induces the spin canting in the vicinity of the\ninterface.\nIn Fig. 3, several quantities in the CA-GAF state are\nplotted as a function of the distance z from the center of\nthe heterostructure: the spatial modulation of the layerdependent electron density n(z), magnetization m(z) and\nstaggered magnetization mstag (z). This figure confirms\nthe above statement that the weak charge binding Ec < t\n(\u03bbT F > a) induces the charge leakage toward the bandinsulating region; the electron density drops from n \u2243 1\nto \u2243 0 over a few layers across the interface, and the\nfinite electron density is even observed in outer layers\n(|z| > 5). In addition, the band occupation is always\nless than n = 1 through the heterostructure. These\nfeatures are analogous to the preceding studies17,18,23,38 .\nTurning to the properties of magnetism, the values of\nthe staggered magnetization are almost saturated inside\nthe MI region (|z| < 5) and at the interface layers, respectively, and the magnetic moments are gradually diminished away from the corresponding regions. We note\nthat in this CA-GAF phase, the characteristic behaviors\nof n(z), mstag (z) and m(z) presented in Fig. 3 are consistent with the DMFT results24 , where good agreement\nbetween DMFT and Hartree -Fock analysis is only found\nfor the electron density and the staggered magnetization.\nAll such features manifest themselves in the corresponding layer-resolved single-particle spectral function\nA\u03c3,\u03c3\u2032 (z, \u03c9) in Fig. 4, where we plot one of the spin-\n\n0.3\n0.15\n0\n0.15\n0\n0.15\n0\n0.2\n0\n0.95\n0\n0.95\n0\n0.95\n0\n0.95\n0\n0.95\n0\n\nU/t = 12, Ec/t = 0.8\n\nz=8\nA\u2191\u2191\nA\u2193\u2193\n\nz=0\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n\u03c9 /t\nFIG. 4: Layer-resolved single-particle spectral function A\u03c3\u03c3\nfor the CA-GAF state with U/t = 12, Ec /t = 0.8, N = 10.\nSolid and broken lines indicate A\u2191\u2191 and A\u2193\u2193 components, respectively.\n\ndependent components A\u03c3,\u03c3 (z, \u03c9). Around the center of\nthe heterostructure (z \u2243 0), the conduction band gets\nquite narrow, and the opening of the gap (\u2243 U mstag (z) \u2243\nU ) is observed due to the AF ordering; inside the MI region, the competition of the on-site U and the attractive\nCoulomb potential sustains the electron occupancy approximately 1 per site. In contrast, in the BI regions,\nthe form of spectral function well reproduces that of\nthe free electrons in the bulk systems23,24,38 , and the\nwhole conduction band is finally pushed above the Fermi\nlevel for |z| & 7. However, when approaching the interface, the spectral function is gradually shifted downward to the chemical potential because of the interplay\nof the electron spreading and binding effects along the\nz-axis. Metallic layers are, thus, formed around the interface, and as can be seen in Fig. 3, these layers also\ncarry a ferromagnetic spin polarization. Note that although the layer-dependent magnetization looks in good\nagreement with the previous DMFT analysis24 , the origin of the present magnetization should be understood\nby the so-called Stoner mechanism. Actually the meanfield phase diagram of two-dimensional Hubbard model\nwell describes the emergence of the spontaneous magnetization for U/t \u2243 10 at the interface showing \u2243 0.4\nband occupation35 . The small, but finite ferromagnetic\nmoments in the neighboring layers could, thus, be identified as a proximity effect from the F ordering in the\ninterface. Therefore, it is necessary to employ other sophisticated methods to give more accurate descriptions of\nthe magnetism in the correlated heterostructure. These\ntreatments are, however, beyond the scope of this paper,\nand we leave this issue for future research.\nWe now return to the discussion on the CA-GAF state.\nAs can be seen in Figs. 3 and 4, the gradual suppression of the spin canting is observed toward the center of\nthe heterostructure, and accordingly the canted AF state\nis restricted to only a narrow region around the interface. Therefore, these results suggest the weak thickness-\n\n\f6\n\n1\n\n10\n\nEc/t=0.8\n\n9\n\nU/t = 11\nEc/t = 1.7\n\n0.8\n\n8\n\nA-sites\nB-sites\n\n7\n\nN\n\nCA-GAF\n\n0.6\n\nn\n\nGAF\n\n6\n5\n\n0.4\n\n4\n3\n2\n\nAAF\n\nPMM\n\nF\n\n1\n\n0.2\n\nBI\n\nMI\n\nBI\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n-6\n\nU/t\nFIG. 5: Ground state phase diagram for the local Coulomb\ninteraction U and thickness of counter-ion layers N at Ec /t =\n0.8. All transitions for each N are found to be second order\nexcept for the first-order AAF-F phase boundary at N = 1.\n\ndependence for the stabilization of the CA-GAF state.\nThis finding is supported by the obtained phase diagram\nwith on-site U and cation layer thickness N , which is\npresented in Fig. 5. For N > 2, the general properties\nare similar; there are PMM, GAF and CA-GAF states\nfrom small to large U regime. In contrast, the result\nof N = 1 shows a considerably different behavior: the\nPMM state for small U , the AAF state for narrow range\nof intermediate U and the F state for large U . Here,\nin the CA-GAF state at N = 2, 3, all layers in the MI\nshow the metallic density of states and a canted spin\nstate, while such layers are limited around the interface\nfor thicker heterostructures N & 4. Compared with the\nPMM-to-GAF transition line, the phase boundary between the GAF and the CA-GAF state are less sensitive\nto N . As mentioned above, this tendency may be explained by the Stoner concept for metallic ferromagnets,\nbecause the electron occupancy at the interface layer is\nessentially independent of the layer thickness for large\nU 35 .\nIn contrast, if Ec /t becomes smaller it is expected that\nthe corresponding phase diagram shows a behavior more\nsensitive to the thickness N . This point is understood as\nfollows; the weak charge binding reduces the occupancy\nat the center of heterostructure, and accordingly smaller\nN further assists the electron leakage toward the bandinsulating region and shows smaller occupation even at\nthe central layers, as compared to thicker heterostructures. The calculated U -Ec phase diagram in Fig.2 confirms the above statement. Actually, at Ec /t \u2243 0.4, we\ncan find the AAF phase at N = 4, which is not found\nat N = 10. Unfortunately, however, it seems difficult\nfor the present mean-field analysis to catch the physical aspect for such small Ec region because the Stoner\nmean field treatment likely overestimates the ferromagnetic tendency in those layers24,39,40 . Hence, the study\nfor such Ec /t \u226a 1 regime will be given elsewhere.\n\n-3\n\n0\n\n3\n\n6\n\nz\nFIG. 6: Comparison of the sublattice-dependent electron densities for U/t = 11, Ec /t = 1.7 at a N = 4 heterojunction as a function of z.

Open and filled circles represent the electron\noccupations at A and B sublattices, respectively.\n\nB.\n\nCharge ordered state for Ec /t > 1\n\nIn this subsection, we focus on the regime Ec /t > 1\n(\u03bbT F < a) where electrons are strongly confined along\nthe z direction. Compared to Ec /t < 1, the electronic\nphase diagram for Ec /t > 1 is less sensitive to the layer\nthickness N and the profile of the electron density. In the\ncorresponding parameter regime, the strong attractive\npotential traps the electrons inside the MI region, and\naccordingly the most mobile electrons are absent in the\nband-insulating region. This observation suggests that\nthe role of the interlayer hopping, i. e. electron hopping\nalong the z direction, is distinguished from that of inplanes, particularly around the interface. It is because\nthe layer-dependent electron occupancy shows an abrupt\nchange across the interface: from n \u2243 1 in the Mottinsulating region to n \u2243 0 in the band-insulating region.\nIn the region of Ec /t > 1, the corresponding phase diagram in Fig. 2 typically consists of the COPM, GAF\nand CO-GAF state. Note that the stabilization of the\nCOPM phase as well as GAF state is well understood\nvia the bulk phase diagram34 . So, we hereafter focus on\nthe interface-specific CO-GAF state.\nThe sublattice-dependent charge distribution for the\nCO-GAF state is shown in Fig. 6. Most of the electrons reside inside the heterostructure, and, thus, only\na few electrons are found in the outer layers. In addition, the resulting checkerboard-type charge ordering\ncan be found only at the interface layer, which is accompanied by a ferromagnetic spin configuration. Therefore,\nthe present result is consistent with the previous density\nfunctional calculation performed by Pentcheva and Pickett26 . The corresponding layer-resolved spectral function\nA(\u03c9) is presented in Fig. 7, where A(A) (solid lines) and\nA(B) (dotted lines) indicate the resulting spectral functions for the A and B sublattices, respectively.

Figure 8(a) shows the order parameter |nA \u2212 nB | of the ferromagnetic CO phase as a\nfunction of Ec . Here, nA (nB ) represents the interface\nelectron density at the A (B) sublattice. The filled and\nopen circles show the results for different values of interlayer hopping tz . At tz /t = 0, the electron motion\nis restricted in the two-dimensional sheet while tz /t = 1\ncorresponds to the isotropic one. We find that the interface charge-ordering is induced in both cases. Note\nthat the charge-ordering is stabilized even at tz /t = 0 in\nthe large Ec region, implying that the ferromagnetic CO\nstate is stabilized due to the long-range Coulomb repulsion within the same plane.26 Namely, the interface layer\nhas the electron density n \u2243 0.4, which increases with\nincreasing Ec and finally approaches the quarter filling\nwhere the checkerboard charge-ordering is particularly\nfavorable.\nOn the other hand, we should take into account the\neffects of electron transfer in the z-direction to explain\nthe charge order emerging for tz /t = 1 in the region of\nEc /t < 1.5 in Fig. 8(a). Figure 8(b) presents the detailed\nstudy of the tz -dependent CO parameter at Ec /t = 1.4.\nAs seen from the figure, the CO phase becomes more pronounced with increasing tz . This trend seems, however,\nto contradict the above-mentioned mechanism, since the\nincrease in tz causes the electron transfer into the bandinsulating region and, thus, depletes the interface, potentially suppressing charge ordering. Therefore, it seems\ndifficult to attribute the origin of the CO-GAF state only\nto the long-range Coulomb repulsion for Ec /t \u2243 1.5.\nTo elucidate another possible mechanism, we focus on\na nontrivial role of tz that induces the effective interlayer magnetic interaction.

(b) the detailed tz dependence is depicted for Ec /t = 1.5. To obtain the values\nfor tz /t 6= 1 we here use the result of tz /t = 1 as an initial\ninput and tune the magnitude of the inter-layer hopping.\n\nthe sublattice-dependent magnetization and the interface CO parameter as a function of U , respectively. In\nthe vicinity of the CO-transition point U/t \u2243 9.5, the\ninterface magnetization spontaneously appears via the\nexchange mechanism, causing different spin configurations between two sublattices; A-sites (lower occupancy)\npresent a ferromagnetic spin alignment with the neighbor layer located inside the heterostructure while B-sites\n(higher occupancy) prefer the anti-parallel one. Hence,\nferrimagnetism is stabilized at the interface. According\nto our numerical results, A-sites always carry the lower\nelectron density compared to B-sites around z \u2243 2. To\nclarify the relation between this spin structure and the interface charge-ordering, we take into account the charge\nconfinement effect along the z-axis; for Ec /t > 1 (i.e.\n\u03bbT F < a), the strong charge binding via the positive\nbackground localizes the electrons inside the heterostructure (z \u2264 |3| in Fig. 6), and thus it is not energetically\nfavorable to keep the higher occupancy outside the heterostructure. Therefore, the electron occupancy for the\nA-sites decreases to suppress the charge-transfer toward\nthe band-insulating region. This in turn increases the\noccupancy at B-sites, which may enhance the antiferromagnetic correlation along the z direction.

In summary, we may interpret the interface\ncharge order as being induced by interlayer spin coupling\nin order to reduce the charge leakage from the interior\ntoward the band insulator. This spin-driven mechanism,\ntogether with long-range Coulomb interaction, stabilizes\nthe CO-GAF phase even for the relatively weak Ec .\n\nIV.\n\nEFFECTS OF MAGNETIC FIELDS\n\nIn this section, we discuss the nature of the heterostructure under external magnetic fields to further\nclarify the interplay of the magnetism and the charge\ndensity profile. As discussed in the previous section, the\npossible ground states are closely connected with the profile of charge distribution. At zero magnetic field, the\nlong-range Coulomb interaction Ec plays an important\nrole in determining the charge density profile along the\nz-axis. We also note that magnetic fields can have a\nstrong influence on the charge distribution by modifying\nin the spin structure which governs the charge distribution in the vicinity of the interface18 . In the following,\nwe analyze the effect of magnetic fields on the density\nmodulation. Throughout this section, we consider the\nheterostructure with N = 10, but the obtained results\n\nWe first concentrate on the appearance of a metamagnetic transition in the heterostructure under external\nmagnetic fields. Figure 10(a) shows the layer-dependent\nmagnetization as a function of H for fixed values U/t = 8\nand Ec /t = 0.8. Note that in the absence of external\nfields, the corresponding ground state is the GAF in this\nparameter regime (Sec. III). With increasing H the interface magnetization (open circles) displays a discontinuous\njump around H \u2243 0.8, signaling a first-order metamagnetic transition. This is confirmed by a hysteresis loop\nemerging with rising and lowering magnetic fields. In\ncontrast, we do not find any anomalous behaviors in the\nmagnetization at the central layer (filled circles); it increases monotonically without exhibiting any jumps, and\nsmoothly approaches the saturated value m \u2243 n \u2243 1.\nThese results imply that the metamagnetism observed\nhere is intrinsic to the interface. Interestingly, this metamagnetic transition is intimately connected with the\ncharge distribution, as shown in Fig. 10(b), where the\nleft (open) and right (filled symbols) axes display the\ncomputed electron density at the interface and the central layer, respectively. As clearly seen in this figure,\nthe electron density exhibits the same anomalous behavior as in the magnetization in Fig. 10(a): (i) there exist\nthe abrupt jumps in both quantities only at the interface at the same magnetic fields and (ii) a hysteresis loop\nemerges with increasing/decreasing magnetic fields. This\npronounced change in the electron density is restricted to\nthe vicinity of the interface.\nTherefore, in order to understand the origin of the interface metamagnetism, it is crucial to elucidate how the\nmagnetism is related to the charge distribution in the\nheterostructure. To this end, we show the U -dependent\nelectron density for H = 0 at several layers in Fig. 11:\nthe center layer (z = 0), the nearest-neighbor layer to\nthe interface (z = 4) and the interface layer (z = 5). The\ncharacteristic feature appears at the PMM-to-GAF transition point U/t \u2243 3, around which the gradients of the\ncurves for z = 4 and z = 5 change their signs, in contrast to the monotonic change in the PMM state (dotted\nlines). On the other hand, the electron density at the central layer depends only weakly on U . This observation\nis consistent with the previous finding that the density\nprofile is affected by the electronic phases inside the heterostructure18,38 .

This scenario is also applicable to the present case\nsince in the bulk phase diagram, the conventional GAF\nphase prefers the singly occupied sites. Therefore, in order to support the emergence of antiferromagnetism, it is\nnecessary to confine the electrons inside the heterostructure with varying the density profile along the z-axis. We\nnote that such charge redistribution occurs only near the\ninterface18 , and plays a rather minor role in comparison\nwith the long-range interaction Ec . Hence, the interface\nelectrons are mainly confined to the Mott-insulating region, and the resulting density profile changes abruptly\nacross the interface.\nRecall here that the applied magnetic fields have a tendency to destroy the AF ordering. Such a suppression\nseems to be stronger near the interface than the central\nlayers because the number of the nearest-neighbor sites\ncoupled antiferromagnetically to each other decreases\nfrom 6 at the central layers to 5 at the interface. This,\nin turn, increases the field-induced magnetic moment\naround the interface. Especially the interface magnetization is immediately saturated because of the extremely\nweak AF ordering and the large spin susceptibility via\nin-plane instability toward Stoner ferromagnetism. Nev-\n\nertheless, below the metamagnetic transition point, the\ninterface AF-moment remains finite through the proximity effect from the neighboring layers (see Fig. 3). Thus,\nit will be energetically favorable in a magnetic field to\nincrease the electron occupation at the interface. On\nthe other hand, the charge confinement along the z-axis,\ndriven by magnetism, would become more relevant for\nlarge U because of the strong AF coupling as shown in\nFig. 11. This means that the competition between correlation effects and the influence of the magnetic field\nis crucial for determining the AF order at the interface.\nThis gives rise to the metamagnetic transition accompanied by a redistribution of electron charge near the interface. At the critical magnetic field, we indeed find the\ndiscontinuous drop in the staggered magnetization near\nthe interface, confirming that the metamagnetism is indeed caused by the charge redistribution of electrons, as\nseen in Fig. 11.\nThis view is further confirmed by our numerical results.\nFigure 12 shows the computed magnetization at the interface for several values of U . The resulting magnetization remarkably changes its behavior across a critical\nend point of U/t \u2243 7.5. Though the magnetization varies\ncontinuously below this value, the first-order metamagnetic transition is obtained for U/t & 8, above which the\ncritical magnetic field displays a gradual decrease with increasing U . These tendencies agree well with the above\nsuggestion, because relatively large values of U may enhance the difference between two effects: spreading and\nconfinement of electrons along the z direction due to magnetic fields and local Coulomb interaction, respectively.\n\nB.\n\nField induced charge ordered state\n\nIn the relatively large Ec regime, the charge redistribution under external magnetic fields reveals another in-\n\n\f10\n0.4\n\nEc/t=0.8\n\nU/t=12(CA-GAF)\n\n|nA-nB| (interface)\n\n0.6\n\nm (interface)\n\n0.5\n\nU/t=8\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n\nU/t=4\n0.1\n\nEc /t = 1.5, U/t = 11\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n(a)\n\n0.0\n\n0\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\nH\nFIG. 12: The magnetization curves at the interface for several\nvalues of the on-site interaction.

Generally, the strong inter-site\nCoulomb interaction (\u2243 Ec ) may break the translation\ninvariance and induce the CO in the bulk systems. As\nmentioned in the previous section, at H = 0, there actually exists the interface CO state of checkerboard pattern, i.e. CO-GAF phase.26 Figure 13(a) displays the behavior of such interface charge ordering in applied magnetic fields. In weak magnetic fields, the CO immediately\ndisappears with increasing field. This is caused by the\nemergence of the special magnetic order at the interface\nwhich partially supports the stabilization of the interface\ncharge-ordering as mentioned in Sec. III B, so that the\ndisappearance of the magnetic order weakens the interface charge-ordering.\nSurprisingly, we encounter a reentrant CO state with\nfurther increasing H; the checkerboard charge-ordering\nemerges again around H \u2243 0.9 only at the interface. Note\nthat there is a discontinuous jump accompanied by a hysteresis loop in the order parameter, implying that the\ntransition is of first order. Furthermore the order parameter of the field-induced CO phase is almost unchanged\nonce it is induced. This H-dependence suggests that\nthe origin of the interface charge-ordering is the intersite Coulomb repulsion. This view is indeed confirmed\nin Fig. 13(b). Above H \u2243 0.9, around which the fieldinduced CO phase occurs, the averaged electron density\nat the interface nave = (nA + nB )/2 shows a plateau at\nnave = 0.5. As is the case for a conventional GAF state,\nthe checkerboard CO can be caused by the Fermi-surface\nnesting, particularly at quarter filling. Therefore, the\nin-plane CO state stabilized with nave = 0.5 above the\ncritical magnetic field in Fig. 13 evidences that this CO\nstate is driven by the intersite Coulomb repulsion under\nthe quarter-filling condition. We note in Fig. 13(b) that\nbelow the critical magnetic field (H \u223c 0.9), there is another first-order transition around H \u223c 0.85 with a small\njump in nave . This is due to the metamagnetic transition\ndiscussed in Sec. IV A (see also Fig. 14(a)).\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nH\nFIG. 13: Plot of interface electron density at U/t = 11, Ec / =\n1.5 as a function of magnetic fields.

(b) the corresponding interface occupation number,\ndefined by nave = (nA + nB )/2. Dotted line shows the value\nof the quarter filled band: nave = 1/4.\n\nSince there exists a finite charge excitation gap at the\ninterface, the field-induced CO state would be experimentally detected, for example, as a rapid drop in the\nconductivity with increasing H.\n\nC.\n\nPhase diagram under magnetic fields\n\nIt is instructive now to present the phase diagram under magnetic fields. Figure 14(a) shows the calculated\nphase diagram with the parameter Ec and the magnetic field H. The field-induced charge-ordering (closed\nsquares) can be found in the regime of relatively large\nEc and H. This trend indeed confirms our prediction\npresented in Sec. IV B concerning the origin of the transition: the important interplay of the band occupancy\n(nave = 0.5) and the long-range Coulomb repulsion. In\ncontrast, increasing Ec seems less relevant for the metamagnetic transition (filled circles), since this transition\nis accompanied with the increase of electron density at\nthe interface, which is unfavorable for large Ec . Interestingly, such charge redistribution would further enhance\nthe tendency toward the field-induced CO transition. Indeed these transition lines gradually merge in the large\nEc region.\nThe nature of phase transition from CA-GAF to COGAF state under the magnetic fields, shown by the dotted line in Fig. 14(a), remains still open.

Filled squares: the phase\nboundary obtained at Ec /t = 1.5, illustrating the discontinuous transition toward the field-induced CO phase with increasing H.\n\n(a) and (b), is correct.\nFigure 14(b) presents the U -dependence of the metamagnetism and the field-induced charge-ordering, respectively. As mentioned in Sec. IV A, the metamagnetic\ntransition can appear only in the large U region, and\nthus a critical point may exist around U/t \u2243 7.5. Here,\nthe overall U -dependence of the field-induced chargeordering resembles that of the metamagnetic transition;\nthe value of the critical magnetic field Hc increases monotonically with decreasing U . However, the difference between these transitions is found in the lowest critical values of Hc . Although the interface metamagnetism transition is of first-order only for U/t & 8, we find the discontinuous charge-ordering transition in a much wider\nrange of the on-site interaction. This is because the intersite Coulomb interaction with the specific occupancy\nof electrons plays a dominant role in the transition to\nthe field-induced CO phase, and the on-site Hubbard interaction merely modifies the electron occupancy at the\ninterface with inducing magnetism.\nV.\n\nate Ec (\u2243 1.4t), the specific interlayer magnetic coupling\nmight drive the CO-GAF phase at H = 0 [Sec. III B].\nTherefore, if such a spin structure is suppressed with the\nincrease in H, the CO-GAF state would undergo a firstorder transition to the CA-GAF state as is the case for\nH = 0. Note that these two phases are distinguished by\nthe direction of the interface F-moment as well as the CO\nparameter, |nA \u2212 nB |. However, for large Ec & 1.6t, the\ninterface charge-order even survives in the large H region without the spin coupling between layers, and thus\nthe difference between CO- and CA-GAF states are only\ngiven by the order parameter |nA \u2212 nB |. Accordingly,\nas shown in Fig. 15 (b), the CO- and CA-GAF phases\nmight be continuously connected beyond the certain critical value of H. In the present study, however, we cannot\ndetermine which of the two scenarios, depicted in Fig. 15\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper, we have considered the generalized Hubbard model and presented the mean-field study on the\nground-state properties of the correlated heterostructure\ncomposed of a Mott insulator (MI) sandwiched between\ntwo band insulators (BI). The model structure is electrostatically characterized by the positively charged ions\nlocated in the Mott-insulating region, causing a spatial\nmodulation of the electron distribution. Such a profile\nof electron density along z direction can be tuned by\nthe long-range Coulomb interaction and also by the onesite interaction via the magnetic moment induced inside\nthe heterostructure. Using a relatively wide range of parameters and tuning spin structures via external magnetic fields, we have investigated how the inhomogeneous\ncharge distribution leads to the intriguing electronic and\nmagnetic phases realized in the model heterostructure.\n\n\f12\nAt zero magnetic field, our model exhibits rich electronic phases in the U -Ec plane, including CA-GAF,\nCO-GAF and some other conventional ordered states.\nThe resulting phase diagram changes its charge character around Ec /t \u2243 1 (\u03bbT F \u2243 a). For Ec /t < 1, where\nthe density profile of electrons gradually changes beyond\nthe interface layer, we have found the CA-GAF phase for\nrelatively large U , which consists of the GAF oder inside the MI region and a canted AF phase in the vicinity\nof the interface. Interestingly, even though the spatially\nmodulated magnetization is caused by the Stoner mechanism, our results are in good agreement with the earlier\nDMFT study of Okamoto and Millis24 . Note that the\nCA-GAF phase has been proposed for the first time in\nthis paper . On the other hand, for Ec /t > 1, we have\nfound the ferromagnetic CO state with checkerboard pattern at the interface as suggested by previous ab initio\ncalculations26 . In some parameter regime, however, this\nCO state might not be explained only in terms of the\nlong-range Coulomb repulsion. As an additional mechanism supporting the interface charge-ordering, we have\nproposed the importance of the interlayer electron hopping, which causes the site-dependent interlayer spin couplings and thereby enhances the instability toward the\ncharge-ordering together with the long-range Coulomb\nrepulsion.\nIt has been demonstrated that a strong coupling between spin and charge degrees of freedom is crucial for the\nsystem in magnetic fields, giving rise to the field-driven\ncharge redistribution in the vicinity of the interfaces. One\nof the remarkable consequences of this effect is a firstorder metamagnetic transition. It has been shown that\nthis transition is induced by the competition of two effects: the localization of electrons inside the center region\nof the heterostructure via the GAF ordering (U ), and the\ncharge transfer toward the interface via the spin polarization (H). This mechanism is fully supported by the\ncomputed U -dependence of the metamagnetic transition\nand the specific jump in the interface electron density as\na function of H.\nAnother remarkable phenomenon we found here is the\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nA.

This transition\nat the interface is possible only for relatively large Ec ,\nand is explained in terms of the modification of interface\nelectron density through the competition of U and H;\nthe intersite Coulomb repulsion together with an emergent quarter-filled band condition gives the instability\ntoward the CO phase. This also demonstrates the importance of the interplay between the spin and charge\ndegrees of freedom in magnetic fields. In order to gain\nfurther insights into the effects of magnetic fields, we have\npresented the Ec -H and U -H phase diagrams, and found\nthat characteristic features of the resulting phase boundaries are consistent with our scenario for the field-driven\nmetamagnetic/charge-ordering transitions.\nIn this paper, we have performed the mean-field analysis for the magnetic properties of the heterostructure,\nwhich are strongly coupled to the inhomogeneous charge\ndistribution. Although this simple treatment provides an\ninsight into physical properties of the model, it is particularly important to confirm the present results by taking\ninto account strong electron correlations with many-body\ntechniques such as DMFT23 and slave-boson method38 .\nThis issue will be studied elsewhere.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to M.
