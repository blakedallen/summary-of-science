In a typical eruption, a huge amount of energy (up\nto 1032 ergs), magnetic flux (up to 1022 Mx), and plasma (up to 1016 g) is flowing into the\noutermost corona and interplanetary space (Zhang & Low 2005). Meanwhile, many activities\ndue to the secondary effect of the energy conversion are invoked (Chen et al. 2006, 2007\nand references therein). These activities include various types of radio bursts, the Moreton\nwave sweeping the chromosphere, the EIT wave, the X-ray wave, and the coronal dimming\npropagating in the corona, and so on (e.g., see Table 1 of Hudson & Cliver 2001, and Forbes\net al. 2006 for a brief review). It is now widely accepted that radio bursts, such as types\nII and III radio bursts, are caused by the energetic electrons accelerated in the CME-driven\nshock and in the flare region, respectively (e.g., see Bastian et al. 1998), and that the EIT\ndimming seen by the Extreme-Ultraviolet (EUV) Imaging Telescope (EIT, Delaboudini\u00e8re\net al. 1995) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), results from\nthe sudden depletion in the plasma density in a rapid energy release process. As for the\nMoreton wave and the EIT wave, it is very likely that they are the results of CMEs, but\ntheir relationship and the nature of EIT wave are still of the subject of active research, and\nno hard and fast conclusion could yet be drawn. Furthermore, the debate on the relationship\namong various global waves (Moreton, EIT, X-ray waves) is still far from being settled.\nThe Moreton wave was identified for the first time by Moreton & Ramsey (1960) in\nseveral flare events. They noticed the disturbance of the chromosphere observed in H\u03b1\npropagating distances over 105 km at speeds ranging from 400 to 2000 km s\u22121 (e.g., see\nalso Becker 1958 and Smith & Harvey 1971). Therefore, propagation of the Moreton wave\nis always super-Alfv\u00e9nic. Observations indicate that the Moreton wave also has co-spatial\nsignatures in the corona known as the X-ray disturbance or wave (e.g., see Rust & \u0160vestka\n1979; Khan & Aurass 2002; Narukage et al. 2002), and the lifetime of the X-ray wave is\nusually less than 10 minutes.\nFor the first time, Rust & \u0160vestka (1979) noticed the propagating phenomenon in soft\nX-ray when studying an event that was observed by the Skylab. This event caused a coronal\ndisturbance seen in soft X-ray propagating at speed up to 400 km s\u22121 . They pointed out that\nthe disturbance resulted from the disruption of a filament. Because this filament eruption\npreceded the associated flare, the source of the disturbance was unlikely to be the flare. In\nthe era of the Skylab, the term \"CME\" did not exist yet. Based on our present knowledge\non the flare, eruptive prominence, and CME, we believe that the event observed by Rust &\n\u0160vestka (1979) started with an eruptive prominence and produced a CME consequently, and\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nthe CME ignited the disturbance and the consequent propagating phenomenon seen in soft\nX-ray.\nKhan & Aurass (2002) reported the appearance of the Moreton wave and the simultaneous wave-like disturbance in the corona. Narukage et al. (2004) also noticed that associated\nwith the disturbance in the chromosphere, the corona showed disturbance in soft X-ray at the\nsame time. They named such a disturbance X-ray wave. They found that the disturbance\nin two layers propagate roughly at same speed, such that the Moreton wave propagated at\nspeed of 500 km s\u22121 and the X-ray wave at speed of 600 km s\u22121 . They suggested that the\nX-ray wave is a weak fast mode shock in the corona, and thus the coronal counterpart of the\nMoreton wave. Uchida (1968) ascribed the Moreton wave to the coronal fast-mode shock\nfront as the wave skirt sweeps the chromosphere, and further pointed out that the fast-mode\nshock wave could invoke the type II radio burst as well (Uchida 1974). The tight association\nof the type II radio bursts to the Moreton wave (e.g., see Wild et al. 1963; Kai 1970; Uchida\n1974; Pinter 1977; Chen et al. 2005a) strongly suggests the shock origin of the Moreton\nwave. Cliver et al. (1999) also presented evidence based on the SMM and the GOES X-ray\ndata, and the Solwind coronagraph data that type II radio bursts and the Moreton waves\nhave their root cause in fast CMEs.\nThe CME-driven shock is usually believed to account for the type II radio bursts (e.g.,\nsee Mancuso et al. 2002; Mancuso & Raymond 2004; Lin et al. 2006; and references therein).\nIt has been well established that km type II bursts are manifestations of interplanetary shocks\nformed in front of CMEs through its piston-driven mechanism (Sheeley et al. 1985), and\nthat dm-hm type II bursts generally correspond to the propagation of CME-driven shocks\nthrough the corona. The origin of metric type II bursts is still an open question. There\nare two competing classes of models for the metric type II radio burst: those that assuming\nthe CME-driven shock origin and those that flare-related blast wave origin (e.g., see also\nGopalswamy & Hanaoka 1998; Lin et al. 2006; and references therein).\nCliver et al. (2005) re-examined the relationship between the rapid acceleration phase\nof CMEs and the onset of type II bursts for six events that figured prominently in the debate\non the \"flare versus CME origin of the metric type II radio bursts.\" Each of these events\nhad been investigated by one or more sets of authors with the general conclusion that flare\nblast waves or flare ejecta were responsible for the metric type II radio bursts. But Cliver et\nal. (2005) arrived at the opposite conclusion that \"CMEs remain a strong candidate to be\nprincipal/sole driver of metric type II shocks vis-\u00e0-vis flare blast waves/ejecta\", and \"these\nsix events exhibited ample evidence of dynamic behavior\" of several important aspects that\n\"was consistent with the cataclysmic disruption of the low solar atmosphere one would expect\nto be associated with CMEs.\" The result of Lin et al. (2006) also provided a very positive\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nargument in theory for the CME-driven shock origin of the type II burst.\nThe more debatable question currently, as well as another important focus of this work,\nis the so-called EIT wave, which was, for the first time, directly imaged by EIT in 195 \u00c5. It\nwas seen to propagate global disturbances in the corona, which are known as the EIT wave\nlater on. The EIT wave is most visible in the lower corona (at 1-2 MK), its lifetime is over\nan hour, and the average velocity ranges from 25 to 450 km s\u22121 (Thompson & Myers, 2009),\nwhich is about a third or less of those of Moreton waves. Since in some events a sharp EUV\nwave front was found to be cospatial with an H\u03b1 Moreton wave (Thompson et al. 1998,1998,\n2000) and with a soft X-ray wave in the corona (Khan & Aurass, 2002; Hudson et al., 2003),\nEIT waves were thus considered as the coronal counterparts of the chromospheric Moreton\nwaves.\nHere we have a problem: some authors considered the X-ray wave the coronal counterpart of the Moreton Wave, and the others considered the EIT wave the counterpart. These\ntwo views actually constitute part of the debate in the community on the relationship among\nthese different global wave phenomena.\nBy investigating three different EIT waves, Delann\u00e9e (2000) suggested that the EIT\nwave is more closely related to the magnetic field evolution involved in CMEs than to wave\npropagation driven by solar flares. Ballai et al. (2005) studied T RACE EUV data to\nshow that EIT waves are indeed waves with a well-defined period. Based on the MHD\nsimulations, Chen et al. (2002, 2005a, 2005b) showed that EIT waves are thought to be\nformed by successive stretching or opening of closed field lines driven by an erupting flux\nrope as originally suggested by Delann\u00e9e & Aulanier (1999). However, the arguments of\nWills-Davey et al. (2007) constitute the main difficulties of Chen et al. (2002, 2005a, 2005b)\nin ascribing the EIT wave to the opening of the closed field lines, and suggest that the origin\nand the nature of EIT waves remain elusive, and more investigations need to be done.\nRecently, Tripathi & Raouafi (2007) studied a CME event on 2000 March 5, and provided\nstrong evidence in favor of the interpretation that EIT waves are indeed a counterpart of\nthe CME-driven shock wave in the lower corona. Attrill et al. (2007) investigated properties\nof two EIT waves and noticed a new property of EIT waves: dual brightenings. They\nsuggested that a mechanism where driven magnetic reconnections between the skirt of the\nexpanding CME magnetic field and quiet-Sun magnetic loops generate the observed bright\ndiffuse front, and the dual brightenings and the widespread diffuse dimming are identified\nas innate characteristics of this process.\nIn the spirit of previous works, we are studying in the present work the origin of various\nwave-like phenomena mentioned above via MHD numerical experiments. We shall use a well\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nknown numerical code, ZEUS-2D, that was originally developed by Stone & Norman (1992a,\n1992b) and Stone et al. (1992) and is open to the public, to perform our investigations. We\ndescribe the numerical approaches, including the MHD equations, and the boundary and\ninitial conditions applied to the simulation in the next section. Our results are presented in\nSection 3, we present our discussions on these results in Section 4, and finally we summarize\nthis work in Section 5.\n\n2.\n\nFormulae and Numerical Approaches\n\nWe consider a two-dimensional magnetic configuration in the semi-infinite x-y plane\nwith y = 0 being the bottom boundary located on the bottom of the photosphere or the\ntop of the chromosphere, and y > 0 corresponding to the chromosphere and the corona.\nThis model treats the current-carrying filament floating in the corona as a force-free flux\nrope that is located at height h on the y-axis. The background field is represented by a line\ndipole in the photosphere at depth d below the boundary y = 0. This work is a follow-up\nto that of Forbes (1990). Evolution in this magnetic system is governed by the following\ntwo-dimensional, time-dependent, ideal MHD equations in the Cartesian coordinates:\nD\u03c1\n+ \u03c1\u2207 * v = 0,\nDt\n1\nDv\n= \u2212\u2207p + J \u00d7 B,\n\u03c1\nDt\nc\nD\n\u03c1 (e/\u03c1) = \u2212p\u2207 * v,\nDt\n\u2202B\n= \u2207 \u00d7 (v \u00d7 B),\n\u2202t\nc\nJ=\n\u2207 \u00d7 B,\n4\u03c0\np = (\u03b3 \u2212 1)e,\np = \u03c1kT /mi .\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n\nHere mi is the proton mass, \u03b3 is the ratio of specific heats, the dependent variables are the\nmagnetic field B, the electric current density J, the mass density \u03c1, the flow velocity v,\nthe gas pressure p, and the internal energy density e. We solve equations (1) through (7)\nnumerically by using the ZEUS-2D MHD code developed by Stone & Norman (1992b).\nThe ZEUS-2D code is a two dimensional Eulerian finite difference code solving the\nequations of astrophysical fluid dynamics including the effects of magnetic fields, radiation\ntransport, self-gravity and rotation. The code treats the divergence-free constraint (\u2207 * B =\n0) with the constrained transport (CT) method of Evans & Hawley (1988), and uses the\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nhybrid method of characteristics and constrained transport (MOC-CT) to maintain the stable\nand accurate propagation of all MHD wave modes. In the present work, radiation effects,\nself-gravity and rotation are neglected. More details of the code are available in the work by\nStone & Norman (1992a) and the follow-ups (Stone & Norman 1992b; Stone et al. 1992).\nWe start with the magnetic configuration that consists of three components: a currentcarrying flux rope that is used to model the prominence (or the filament) floating in the\ncorona, the image of the current inside the flux rope, and the background magnetic field\nthat is produced by a line dipole of the relative strength M (see also Forbes 1990) located\nat the depth d below the boundary surface y = 0. The initial magnetic configuration from\nwhich the eruption occurs is given by (see also Forbes 1990)\nBx = B\u03c6 (R\u2212 )(y \u2212 h0 )/R\u2212 \u2212 B\u03c6 (R+ )(y + h0 )/R+\n\u2212 B\u03c6 (r + \u2206/2)Md(r + \u2206/2)[x2 \u2212 (y + d)2 ]/Rd4 ,\n\n(8)\n\nBy = \u2212B\u03c6 (R\u2212 )x/R\u2212 + B\u03c6 (R+ )x/R+\n\u2212 B\u03c6 (r + \u2206/2)Md(r + \u2206/2)2x(y + d)/Rd4 ,\n\n(9)\n\nwith\n2\nR\u00b1\n= x2 + (y \u00b1 h0 )2 ,\n\nRd2 = x2 + (y + d)2 .\nThe initial total pressure, including the gas pressure and the magnetic pressure, as well\nas the mass density are\nZ \u221e\nB\u03c6 (R)j(R)dR,\np = p0 \u2212\n\u03c1 =\n\nR\u2212\n\u03c10 (p/p0 )1/\u03b3 ,\n\n(10)\n\nand B\u03c6 (R) in equations (8) and (9) is determined by the electric current density distribution\nj(R) inside the flux rope, and reads as\n2\u03c0\nj0 R, for 0 \u2264 R \u2264 r \u2212 \u2206/2,\nc (\n\u0012\n\u00132 \u0012 \u00132\n2\u03c0j0 1\n\u2206\n\u2206\nB\u03c6 (R) = \u2212\nr\u2212\n\u2212\n+\ncR\n2\n2\n\u03c0\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u0013\u0015)\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u2206\n\u2206\n\u03c0\n+\nR\u2212r+\n,\ncos\n\u03c0\n\u2206\n2\n\u0003\n2\u03c0j0 \u0002 2\nr + (\u2206/2)2 \u2212 2(\u2206/\u03c0)2 ,\nB\u03c6 (R) = \u2212\ncR\nB\u03c6 (R) = \u2212\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u2206\n\u03c0\n1 2 \u2206R\nR\u2212r+\nR +\nsin\n2\n\u03c0\n\u2206\n2\nfor r \u2212 \u2206/2 < R < r + \u2206/2,\nfor r + \u2206/2 \u2264 R < \u221e;\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nj(R) = j0 , for 0 \u2264 R \u2264 r \u2212 \u2206/2,\nj0\nj(R) =\ncos[\u03c0(R \u2212 r + \u2206/2)/\u2206] + 1, for r \u2212 \u2206/2 < R < r + \u2206/2,\n2\nj(R) = 0, for r + \u2206/2 \u2264 R < \u221e.\n\n(11)\n\nTo this point, the code with the initial configuration (Figure 1) is ready for running with\nthree important parameters fixed: the depth of the line dipole below the boundary surface:\nd = 3.125 \u00d7 103 km, the relative strength of the line dipole M = 1, and \u2206 = 1.25 \u00d7 103\nkm. The computational domain is taken to be (\u2212L, L) \u00d7 (0, 2L) with L = 105 km, and is\ndiscretized into 400 \u00d7 400 grid points. In the present work, we do not normalize parameters\nto the corresponding characteristic values as Forbes (1990) did. Instead we directly use the\ntrue values of these parameters required for running the code. When the system evolves, the\nradius r and the height h of the flux rope, and the electric current density inside the flux\nrope j0 are functions of time; the plasma temperature T and density \u03c1 depend on both time\nand the position in space. The initial values of these parameters are given in Table 1, and\nthe ratio of the specific heats \u03b3 = 5/3.\nThe value of 2.5 \u00d7 103 km for r gives a filament of just 5 times the grid resolution\n\u2206x = 500 km, so the internal structures of the filament is not well resolved. However, using\nsuch a small radius makes the box scale length much larger than the filament scale length,\nand this prevents the open boundary conditions from influencing the early evolution of the\nfilament. The value of j00 yields a strength of the magnetic field at the origin of about 200\nG when the flux rope is absent.\nIn the present work, we are focusing on the wave-like phenomena caused by the disruption of an unstable magnetic configuration, so the initial values of those parameters given\nin Table 1 are not necessarily for a configuration in equilibrium. The boundary condition\nat bottom side y = 0 is a physical one, and those at other three sides are free boundary\nconditions.\nHere, we note that y = 0 in our previous works was either set up at the photospheric\nboundary (e.g., see discussions of Mei & Lin 2008) or at the coronal base (e.g., see Lin &\nvan Ballegooijen 2005 and references therein) depending on the purpose of the specific work.\nIn most cases, on the other hand, whether y = 0 was set up at the photospheric boundary\nor at the coronal base does not matter because the distance between the two layers is small\nTable 1: Initial values for several important parameters of the numerical experiment\nr0 = 2.5 \u00d7 103 km\nh0 = 6.25 \u00d7 103 km\n\u03c10 = 1.672 \u00d7 10\u221212 g cm\u22123 T0 = 106 K\nj00 = 1200 statamp cm\u22122\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\ncompared to the system lengthscale of interest (e.g., see Lin & Forbes 2000, Lin et al. 2001,\nLin et al. 2006). In the present work, however, y = 0 is instead set up on the base of the\nchromosphere (or on the top of the photosphere) that is between the above two layers since\none of the main purposes of this work is to investigate response of the chromosphere to the\nwave-like phenomena. Because the plasma in the photosphere is dense compared to that in\nthe chromosphere and in the corona, the plasma density at and below y = 0 can be taken\nas infinity, and magnetic field lines are line-tied to the boundary surface.\n\n3.\n\nResults of Numerical Experiments\n\nIn this part of work, we present our results of the numerical experiments. Figure 1 shows\nthe initial configuration of the magnetic field. As we have mentioned shortly, this initial\ncondition is not in equilibrium such that the magnetic compression surpasses the magnetic\ntension, so the flux rope starts to rise at the beginning of the experiment. With the liftoff of the flux rope, the closed magnetic field lines become stretched, and a reconnection\nregion forms following the appearance of an X-type neutral point on the boundary surface.\nDiffusion by magnetic reconnection will convert magnetic energy to heating and the kinetic\nenergy of the plasma.\nWe need to note here that no physical diffusion is included (see equation [4]) in our experiment. So a current sheet should form when the magnetic field lines are severely stretched\nduring the eruption as suggested by Forbes & Isenberg (1991) and Lin & Forbes (2000). In\nthe numerical experiment, on the other hand, numerical diffusion substitutes the physical\ndiffusion, and prevents the current sheet from forming and developing. Therefore, during\nthe evolution in the system, there is no current sheet present in the magnetic configuration\nof interest. We do not invest much effort in removing the numerical diffusion in this work\nsince our main goal is to study the MHD shocks and waves associated with CMEs, instead\nof the properties of the current sheet, or the reconnection region. Another reason why we\nleave this diffusion in the experiment is that magnetic reconnection invoked by it will help\nus look into several important details in the flare region.\n\n3.1.\n\nFormation and Propagation of the Shock around the Flux Rope\n\nWith the experiment beginning, the flux rope starts to move from the height of h0 =\n6.25 \u00d7 103 km. At low altitudes and early phase, the propagation speed of the disturbance\ncaused by the flux rope motion is less than local magnetoacoustic speeds, so no shock forms\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nuntil the disturbance travels faster than the magnetoacoustic wave.\nBecause of limited computational resources, we are unable to afford to investigate the\ncase that requires the grid resolution higher than 400 \u00d7 400. This is why we chose \u03c10 =\n1.672 \u00d7 10\u221212 g cm\u22123 , which is about two orders of magnitude larger than that on the\ncoronal base in reality (\u223c 10\u221214 g cm\u22123 ). But the strength of the magnetic field on the\nbase determined according to the parameters given in Table 1 is roughly the true value of\nmagnetic strength in reality. So, the Alfv\u00e9n speed in our calculations is about an order of\nmagnitude lower than that in reality (see Figures 1 and 2 of Lin 2002). A lower Alfv\u00e9n speed\nconsequently allows the MHD shock to form more easily. This may yield slower propagation\nand weaker strength of various waves than in reality, but will not change other properties of\nwaves of interest as well as our conclusions regarding the phenomena studied in this work.\nTo further simplify the problem, we focus in this section on the case in the environment of\nthe constant density, and will investigate the case including the gravity in Section 3.3.\nThe loss of equilibrium causes the flux rope to speed up, and a fast mode shock commences to form in front of it at around t = 12 s. Figure 2 plots variations of the plasma\ndensity versus heights along the y-axis at different times. The highest peak in each panel\nrepresents the flux rope that includes densest material. In the panel of t = 12 s, a slight\nincrease in the density right forward of the flux rope begins to be recognized. The increase\nmoves faster than the flux rope and gradually becomes significant. Because one of the most\nimportant features of the fast mode shock is the apparent enhancement of the plasma density, this second highest peak should thus represent the fast mode shock. In addition to the\nenhancement of the density caused by the shock, we also notice two dimming regions, one\nis right behind the fast mode shock and is shallow, and another is behind the flux rope at\na farther distance and is deep. This scenario almost duplicates what Attrill et al. (2007)\nobserved in a specific event (see Figure 3 of their paper), and should correspond to the dimming usually observed to be associated with CMEs (e.g., see Sterling & Hudson 1997 and\nreferences therein). We shall discuss this issue in more details later.\nTo further confirm that the second peak shown in Figure 2 represents a shock, we are\nstudying the Reynolds number of the fluid nearby the peak, Re = \u03b4yv/\u03bd, where \u03b4y is the\nfull width of the peak at the half maximum, v is its speed moving forward, and \u03bd is the\nkinematic viscosity of the fluid. Basically, a shock develops from an ordinary wave with\nfinite amplitude. In the propagation of the wave, the non-linear effect is important, and the\ncrest of the wave moves faster than its leading or trailing edge. This causes a progressive\nsteepening of the wave front portion as the crest catches up and, ultimately, the gradient of\npressure, density, temperature and velocity become so large that dissipative processes, such\nas viscosity or thermal conduction, are no longer negligible. Then a steady wave-shape is\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nattained with a balance between the steepening effect of the non-linear convective terms and\nthe broadening effect of dissipation. Therefore, the Reynolds number of the fluid, Re , around\nthe shock should be of order of unity (e.g., see also detailed discussions given by Priest 1982,\npp. 189\u2013193).\nIn the present work, although we are dealing with a system that does not include physical\ndiffusive terms, the dissipation exists as a result of the numerical viscosity. So the shock\nforms as the numerical dissipation is balanced by the non-linear steepening effect. Taking\nthe case shown in Figure 2 at t = 50 s as an example. At the location where the second peak\nappears, the propagation speed of the peak is v = 151 km s\u22121 , \u03b4y = 104 km, the local Alfv\u00e9n\nspeed is 37 km s\u22121 , the sound speed is 117 km s\u22121 , and the fast magnetoacoustic speed is\n123 km s\u22121 . In the original work of Stone & Norman (1992a), the numerical viscosity of the\nZEUS-2D code was estimated, which gave \u03bd = 2.7 \u00d7 1016 cm2 s\u22121 . Bring values of the above\nrelevant parameters into the expression for Re , we get Re \u2248 0.56, which is roughly equal to\nunity. This, together with comparison of values of various speeds, indicates that the second\npeak shown in Figure 2 indeed represents the fast mode shock.\nFigure 3 plots the evolutions of the magnetic field and the plasma density as the flux\nrope moves outward. Continuous contours (or curves) are magnetic field lines and the color\nshadings show the density distribution. As a denser area due to the enhancement in the\ndensity, the light yellow region in each panel corresponds to the fast mode shock. We see\nfrom these panels that the fast shock expands sidewards and backwards simultaneously as it\npropagates forward, and forms a crescent feature around the flux rope. At about t = 300 s,\nit touches the boundary surface, and is then reflected by the boundary producing an echo\nat each of its footpoint, which propagates back into the corona.\nThis echo is a true phenomenon, not a numerical artefact. As approaching the bottom\nboundary, the shock enters a region where the plasma density changes in a dramatic way,\nand reflection and transmission of a wave (or shock) will take place in this region. Usually,\nrates of reflection and transmission are governed by the gradient of the density in this region.\nThe larger the gradient is, the stronger the reflection is. In the case studied in this work,\nthe density gradient could be infinity, so significant reflection of the wave (or shock) in this\nregion is expected. Therefore, the echo shown in Figure 3 is a physical result.\nIn the density contour plot, this echo is not apparent, so we study the velocity divergence\n\u2207*v instead. Because the value of \u2207*v is an indicator of the plasma compression, namely how\nmuch the plasma is compressed, changes in the value of \u2207 * v can well manifest the positions\nand propagations of the fast mode shock that causes the most significant compression of the\nfluid. Figure 4 shows the contours of \u2207 * v at various times as the disruption of magnetic\nfield progresses. Compared to those in Figure 3, the characteristics of the fast mode shock in\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nFigure 4 are clear. Furthermore, formation of the echo after the shock touches the boundary\nsurface can be easily recognized from the panel of t = 300 s in Figure 4, and propagations of\nthe echo back into the corona are apparently shown in the subsequent panels as well. Both\nshock and echo are denoted in the left bottom panel of Figure 4.\nObviously, the location where the fast shock touches the boundary surface moves outwards associating with the shock propagation. To reveal more details of this process, we\nstudy the temporal behavior of the distribution of \u2207 * v in space on y = 0. We plotted 12\ncurves in Figure 5 with each one for the distribution of \u2207 * v on the boundary y = 0 from\nx = 0 to x = 105 km at a specific time. The curve at the bottom corresponds to the time\nt = 50 s, the one at the top to t = 600 s, and the time interval between every two adjacent\ncurves is 50 s. Most part of each of these curves is a flat line. This is due to the limited\npropagation speed of the disturbance, and plasma at large distance is not disturbed until\nthe footprints the shock reaches. Therefore, the sequences of the moving features on each\ncurve (see also the arrow in Figure 5) actually represents the propagation of the response\nof the boundary surface to the shock wave, which is implicitly suggestive of the observable\nmoving footprints of the fast mode shock in the chromosphere during the eruption. Further\ncalculation gives a speed of 126 km s\u22121 for the propagation. We account such a propagating\nfeature for the Moreton wave observed in H\u03b1. Consulting Figure 2 of Lin (2002), we find\nthat, in this work, the Alfv\u00e9n speed in the area around y = 0 where the Moreton wave\nsupposes to appear is less than 50 km s\u22121 , which confirms the super-Alfv\u00e9nic property of the\nMoreton wave.\nIn addition to the fast mode shock, we are also able to recognize several other features,\nincluding the slow mode shock developing from two sides of the flux rope and the velocity\nvortices on either side of the reconnection region. All of them are denoted in the left bottom\npanel in Figure 4. To look into more details of the velocity vortices and their impact on\nthe nearby magnetic field, we enlarged a local region of the right bottom panel in Figure 3\nand create a composite of magnetic field lines and streamlines as shown in Figure 6. The\nleft panel in Figure 6 provides a largescale view of both field and stream lines. Two regions\nsurrounded by rectangles display areas in which the flow is strong and the magnetic field\nlines are apparently deformed. Details in these two regions can be seen more clearly after\nthey are further enlarged as shown on the right. The plasma flow manifests apparent vortices\nnear the side back of the flux rope (see the upper panel). The vortices behave the same way\nas noticed by Forbes (1990) such that they do not persist for a very long time at any given\nlocation. Instead they propagate outward toward the open boundaries. Unlike the fast mode\nshock, the vortices could not reach the boundary surface at y = 0.\nBesides the velocity vortices, the plasma flow also show the motion toward the recon-\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nnection region (see the lower panel in Figure 6). As a result of the disruption of the magnetic\nconfiguration, the flux rope moves rapidly upward and leaves a region of lower pressure behind. This yields two flows toward the lower pressure region from opposite direction bringing\nin both plasma and magnetic fields of opposite polarity. Forcing magnetic fields of opposite\nto move together consequently results in the driven magnetic reconnection in that region.\nAlthough the MHD equations (1) through (7) governing the system do not include the physical diffusion term, the numerical diffusion as we have discussed plays the role in dissipating\nthe magnetic field (e.g., see also discussions of Chen et al. 2009).\nComparison among various speeds suggests the formation of the fast shock in front of the\nflux rope. The slow magnetoacoustic speed is smaller than the fast one, so there should be\nthe slow mode shock present somewhere associated with the fast shock formation. Because\nthe slow shock moves apparently slower than the fast shock, the magnetic field behind the\nslow shock is refracted toward the normal of the shock and its strength decreases as the shock\nfront passes by, the slow shock is not very far from the flux rope working as a piston driving\nboth shocks. Comparing the features of magnetic field and the plasma flow around the flux\nrope, we are able to identify a pair of slow shocks in the flank of the flux rope as indicated\nin Figure 4. After identifying the slow shocks, we further notice that the slow shock also\nexpands backward to the bottom boundary like the fast one. But like the velocity vortices,\nthe slow shock cannot reach the boundary, either. It decays and disappears somewhere above\nthe boundary surface.\nIn the region where the slow shock contacts the vortices, the \u2207 * v contours show\ncomplex features. Formation of the velocity vortices are also indicated by the deformation of\nthe magnetic field lines around the reconnection region (see the bottom two panels in Figure\n3 and those in Figure 6). The fact that the slow mode shock and the velocity vortices does\nnot reach the boundary surface can also be seen from the plots in Figure 5 that show the\nsigns of the fast mode shock only.\nResults of Forbes (1990) showed that the velocity vorticity \u2207 \u00d7 v is a good tracer\nof the slow mode shock, especially that developed by the Petschek (1964) reconnection.\nAccording to Forbes (2009, private communications), this has to do with the relative size of\nthe velocity changes across the shock. In the fast mode shock, the normal velocity (\u2207 * v\nmainly results from its change) can at most change by a factor of 4 (e.g., from 1 upstream to\n0.25 downstream). Typically the change is smaller since factor 4 can only be reached when\nthe magnetic field vanishes. In the case of slow mode shock, the normal velocity across a slow\nshock in the switch off limit can at most change by a factor of 5/3 (the plasma \u03b2 = 0 limit).\nHowever, it is the tangential velocity that is important for determining the vorticity. For the\nslow mode shock near the switch off limit, the tangential velocity is capable of undergoing an\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nenormous change. It can be nearly the ambient Alfv\u00e9n speed upstream, and then decreases\nto zero downstream. Therefore, the velocity vorticity \u2207 \u00d7 v should reveals more information\non the slow shock.\nIn two-dimensional configurations as we study here, vector of the velocity vorticity \u2207\u00d7v\nhas the z-component only. Figure 7 shows a set of snapshots of (\u2207 \u00d7 v)z in the time interval\nbetween 50 s to 600 s corresponding to those in Figures 3 and 4. In each panel, the fast\nshock and its echoes can still be seen clearly, but the slow shock becomes more apparent.\nBesides the slow shocks that we already mentioned above, another two pairs of the slow\nmode shocks as a result of the Petschek-type reconnection process (e.g., see also Petschek\n1964, Priest 1982, and Priest & Forbes 2000) are recognized to form from an X-type neutral\npoint below the flux rope.\nAs demonstrated in previous works (e.g., see Forbes & Isenberg 1991; Isenberg et al.\n1993; Forbes & Priest 1995; Lin & Forbes 2000; Lin et al. 2006), magnetic dissipation in\nthe magnetic configuration of interest undergoes very slowly or is almost forbidden due to\nthe high electric conductivity in the corona environment unless a neutral point or a current\nsheet appears in the configuration. The loss of equilibrium in the system stretches the closed\nmagnetic field such that a neutral point or a current sheet forms between the boundary\nsurface and the flux rope. It is this X-point or current sheet that allows fast magnetic\ndissipation in the form of reconnection to occur, converting magnetic energy into heating\nand kinetic energy at a reasonably rapid rate. Figure 8a plots the magnetic field contours\nfor the region below the flux rope. In this region an X-type neutral point exists. Figure\n8b plots the distribution of magnetic field Bx along the y-axis to further confirm that an\nX-point does exist in that region. Due to the symmetry of the configuration, By vanishes on\nthe y-axis. So investigating the behavior of Bx on the y-axis alone should be able to provide\nus the information needed for demonstrating the existence of the X-point.\nTwo pairs of slow mode shocks develop from the X-point. These shocks are similar\nto those proposed originally by Petscheck (1964), except that the downward ones are not\nvery apparent since they usually dissociate into isothermal shocks and conduction fronts (see\ndiscussions of Forbes & Acton 1996 for more details). But those propagating upward remain\nrecognizable during the whole process. Associated with this pair of slow mode shocks is the\nreconnected plasma and magnetic flux that enters the CME bubble, increasing the amount\nof mass and magnetic flux in the CME (or interplanetary CME) that eventually flows into\ninterplanetary space as suggested by Lin et al. (2004).\nWith the evolution progressing, the slow shocks invoked around the flux rope extend\nside-back to the flank of the flux rope as well, similar to the fast one. As shown by those in\nFigure 4, panels in Figure 7 clearly indicate that the layers in the lower atmosphere where\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nthe fast and the slow shocks can reach are quite different. To further address this point, we\nstudy the distribution of (\u2207 \u00d7 v)z on the boundary surface y = 0 as we did for Figure 5.\nFigure 9a plots 12 (\u2207 \u00d7 v)z curves versus x on y = 0 in the time interval between\nt = 50 s and t = 600 s. Like what we see from Figure 5, plots in Figure 9a show clear sign\nof the fast shock that sweeps the boundary surface at speed of around 126 km s\u22121 . But\nthese plots do not display any sign of the slow mode shock or the velocity vortices. Figure 7\nsuggests that the disturbance caused by the slow shock and the velocity vortices should exist\nin the higher layers. Testing indicates that the impact of the slow shock starts appearing\nabove the layer of y = 0.3.\nAs an example, we duplicate the 12 plots shown in Figure 9a for y = 0.3, and the\nresults are displayed in Figure 9b. Difference between Figures 9a and 9b is significant. The\nplots manifest clearly two propagating features at layer y = 0.3, one moves faster and the\nother moves slower. Obviously, the faster one is the disturbance caused by the fast shock\nin the corona, and it is quite likely to account for the X-ray waves reported by Rust &\n\u0160vestka (1970), Khan & Aurass (2002), and Narukage et al. (2004). The slower one should\nbe the footprint of either the slow shock or the velocity vortices or the both in the corona.\nAccording to the distance it propagates at specific times, we find that the slow shock sweeps\nthe coronal layer of y = 0.3 at speed of about 50 km s\u22121 , which is around 40% the speed\nthe fast shock sweeps the boundary layer y = 0.0. Considering the observational features\nof the EIT wave and the layer where the EIT wave is seen in the solar atmosphere (e.g.,\nsee Thompson et al. 1998; Atrill et al. 2007; Wills-Davey et al. 2007; Thompson & Myers\n2009), we conclude that these results are highly suggestive of EIT waves originating from\nthe disturbance by the slow mode shocks and the velocity vortices in the corona.\n\n3.2.\n\nFormation of Dimming Areas and Disturbance Nearby\n\nThe dimming, which we are discussing here and is commonly mentioned and studied in\nthe community, is the region observed darker than the surrounding area in the eruption. It\nis believed that the magnetic field configuration is severely stretched by the eruption in a\ntransient way, causing the volume of the magnetic structure to increase and plasma density\ndensity in the structure to decrease quickly, strongly depletes the coronal emission, and\nforms dimming regions on the solar disk (e.g., see Forbes & Lin 2000; Harrison & Lyons\n2000; Harrison 1997; Zarro et al. 1999; Thompson et al. 2000; Harrison et al. 2003).\nTherefore, the dimming, we are studying here, is not caused by the low temperature plasma\nfrom the chromosphere flowing into the coronal structure. Instead it is caused by the density\ndecrease as a result of the eruption.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nThe low density region that forms in our numerical experiment can be seen in Figure 3.\nIt is shown in blue color. This region keeps expanding as the eruption progresses. Although\nFigure 2 provided some information of the dimming in the eruption, it is only for that along\nthe y-axis. To display evolutionary behaviors of this whole region, we plot in Figure 10\nvariations of plasma density in the x-y plane versus time. In each panel, the x-y plane\nextends horizontally in the direction perpendicular to the paper plane, and the direction\nperpendicular to this plane shows the change in the density. The plane in the middle located\nat \u03c1 = 1.67 \u00d7 10\u221212 g cm\u22123 indicates the background density, in addition, the highest peak\n(i.e., the high mass density) represents the flux rope, the crescent feature represents the fast\nmode shock, and the area that the density is below the background illustrates the dimming.\nThese features have been specified in each panel in Figure 10. In the region between the\nflux rope and the fast mode shock, we noticed there is the disturbance in density present as\nwell. Comparing with Figure 2, Figure 10 apparently provides more details of the dimming\nregion, and well duplicates the observational results of Attrill et al. (2007).\nBefore ending this part of work, we need to address one more point regarding the type\nII radio burst and its origin in eruption. Whether the type II burst originates from the\nCME-driven shock or from the flare-blast wave has long be an open question (e.g., see Lin\net al. 2006 and references therein), and is still a subject of active researches.\nWhether a flare could ignite a type II radio burst actually depends how we define a flare.\nIf we follow the traditional definition (e.g., see \u0160vestka 1976) or the term, the eruptive solar\nflare, given by Forbes & Isenberg (1991), then any eruptive process could be classified into\nthe category of flare that may produce the burst. With the development of observations and\ntheoretical studies, on the other hand, the definition of various manifestations of an eruptive\nprocess becomes more specific. For example, we usually distinguish solar flares, eruptive\nprominences, and CMEs from on another; and compared to the CME, the flare occupies a\nsmall volume that includes flare ribbons and loops only.\nIn this work, we follow the second definition. So the speed of the fastest motion of the\nlarge scale structure in the flare region is less than 100 km/s in reality (corresponding to\n10 km/s in our calculations), which is the speed of flare loop and ribbon motions (\u0160vestka\n1996; Lin 2002). As many studies and investigations have shown that, the motions of the\nflare loops and ribbons are not involved in any mass motion (e.g., see Schmieder et al. 1987;\nForbes & Acton 1996). Instead these motions result from the successive propagation of the\nenergy release site (or reconnection site) from old field lines to the new ones. Therefore, in\nany sense, it is hard to find an object in the flare region moving fast enough to ignite the\nso-called blast wave that could account for the type II radio burst (e.g., see also discussions\nof Lin et al. 2006). Furthermore, the difference in the plasma densities in the flare region\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n(1012 cm\u22123 ) and at the positions where type II radio bursts usually start to be observed (106\ncm\u22123 ) also implies that the type II radio burst cannot be produced in the flare region.\nThus the flare in such a scenario cannot be a driver of the blast wave that is able\nto account for the type II radio burst although the relevant debate on this issue may last\nfor a while. In fact, evolutionary features of the disrupting magnetic configuration shown\nin Figures 3, 4, 6, and 7 also suggest the absence of any energetic wave-like phenomenon\naround the flare region in addition to the slow mode shocks and velocity vortices. Our results\nindicate that the only igniter that is capable of invoking the burst is the fast mode shock\ndriven by the CME (or the flux rope). This confirms the conclusion of Lin et al. (2006)\nthat there is no agent in the flare region that could be responsible for the ignition of the\ntype II radio burst, that the so-called flare-blast wave, in fact, does not exist, and that the\nCME-driven fast shock is the sole source of the burst, at least our results indicate so.\n\n3.3.\n\nEvolution in the Environment Including the Gravity\n\nIn this section, with the consideration of the gravity, we re-perform the work that\nhas been done shortly. We use the same numerical approaches and formulae except that\nequation (2) now includes the gravity, \u03c1GM\u2299 /(R\u2299 + y)2 . Here the gravitational constant\nG = 6.672 \u00d7 10\u22128 dyn cm2 g\u22122 , the solar mass M\u2299 = 1.989 \u00d7 1033 g, and the solar radius\nR\u2299 = 6.963 \u00d7 1010 cm. Equations in (10) now read as\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015 Z \u221e\nGM\u2299 mp\n1\n1\np = n0 kT0 exp\n\u2212\nB\u03c6 (R)j(R)dR,\n\u2212\nkT0\nR\u2299 + y R\u2299\nR\u2212\n\u03c1 = n0 mp (p/p0 )1/\u03b3 ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere\n\u0014\n\nGM\u2299 mp\np0 = n0 kT0 exp\nkT0\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1\n\u2212\nR\u2299 + y R\u2299\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n,\n\nk is the Boltzmann constant, and the plasma density on the bottom boundary n0 = 1012 cm\u22123\n(or \u03c10 = 1.672 \u00d7 10\u221212 g cm\u22123 ). Note that we are still working on the isothermal case here\nfor two reasons, one is the the simplicity of mathematics, and another one is because the\ntrue corona is roughly isothermal at lower altitude, say within the range of around 0.7 R\u2299\n(see Figure 1 of Lin 2002 as well as the result of Sittler & Guhathakurta 1999).\nFigure 11 shows the initial configuration of the magnetic field and the initial density\ndistribution with the gravity included. Continuous contours are magnetic field lines and\ncolorful shadings show the density distribution. We notice that the plasma density decreases\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nwith height y. The parameters for the initial magnetic configuration remain unchanged. So\nthe initial structure is not necessarily in equilibrium. Following the practice performed in\nprevious sections, we start evolving the system from the non-equilibrium state.\nIn the isothermal environment including the gravity, the plasma density decreases with\naltitude roughly in the exponential way as suggested by (12). In this case, the Alfv\u00e9n speed\nmay become large at higher altitude (e.g., see Figures 1 and 2 of Lin 2002), and magnetic\nreconnection is allowed to take place at a reasonably high rate (e.g., see also discussions of\nLin & Forbes 2000). High rate of reconnection means fast energy conversion, and fast motion\nof the flux rope. So the flux rope motion should be faster here than in the case of constant\nplasma density.\nFigure 12 displays the heights of the flux rope and the fast mode shock versus time\nfor two cases. Curves flux rope 1 and fast shock 1 are for the case without including the\ngravity; and curves flux rope 2 and fast shock 2 for the case including the gravity. Obviously,\ncurves in two cases have nearly the same form, but those in case 2 manifest apparently more\nenergetic behavior. This confirms the conclusion of Lin & Forbes (2000) and Lin (2002)\nthat the flux rope in the isothermal environment is much more easily to escape following the\ncatastrophe than in the constant density environment.\nIn addition, the motion of the flux rope also yields various disturbance phenomena\nnearby as expected. Figure 13 plots the magnetic field and the plasma density at different\nstages in this process. We see from the snapshots in Figure 13 the fast mode shock forming in\nfront of the flux rope, expanding sideward and backward , and producing a crescent structure\naround the flux rope. At about t = 150 s, it touches the boundary surface, and produces\nechoes propagating backward into the corona. The light yellow region nearby the bottom\nboundary y = 0 corresponds to the footprints of the echo, which can be clearly recognized in\nthe time interval between t = 150 s and t = 550 s. Comparing with Figure 3, we notice that\nthe main evolutionary features in the system are duplicated, but an important difference is\nseen clearly: more significant disturbance with more complex patterns in the region near\nthe bottom boundary are produced. Here to show detailed features and properties of the\ndisturbance in this region, we adjust the color code for density distribution such that the\nfast shock is not well displayed in the panels of late time (t > 300 s). But keep in mind that\nthe fast shock is there as shown by Figure 14. We see that the density distribution near\nthe bottom manifest apparent wave-like behavior, and such behavior varies with time. This\nreminds us the oscillatory behaviors of the EIT wave observed by Ballai et al. (2005) and\nLong et al. (2008).\nWe also investigate the divergence and the vorticity of the velocity, \u2207 * v and (\u2207 \u00d7 v)z ,\nrespectively, and their evolution in the eruptive process. Figure 14 shows the magnitude\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nshadings of \u2207 * v (panel a) and (\u2207 \u00d7 v)z (panel b) at t = 500 s. The color shadings represent\nthe distribution of values of \u2207 * v and (\u2207 \u00d7 v)z in space, and several important features are\ndenoted in panel (a). The fast shock, the slow shock, and the velocity vortices can be seen\nclearly from these panels.\nFigure 15 plots the distribution of the z-component of \u2207\u00d7v at various times. As we did\nfor Figure 9, panels (a) and (b) show the distributions of (\u2207 \u00d7 v)z on the boundary surface\ny = 0, and at layer y = 0.3, respectively. We see the similar propagating features on two\nlayers, but the speed is higher than in previous case. The information revealed by Figure\n15a suggests that the fast shock sweeps the bottom boundary surface at speed of around\n138 km s\u22121 , comparing with 126 km s\u22121 in the case of constant density. The sign of the slow\nshock or the velocity vortices at layer y = 0.0 is not clear as expected. In Figure 15b, on the\nother hand, there are two propagating features present, the faster one results from the fast\nshock in the corona, and the slower one should be the footprint of either the slow shock or\nthe velocity vortices or the both in the corona. The speed of the slow propagation is about\n67 km s\u22121 , comparing with 50 km s\u22121 in the constant density case. Therefore, including the\ngravity does not change our conclusions obtained on the basis of studies in previous sections\nabout the origin and property of the Moreton wave and the EIT wave, and the stratification\nof the atmosphere due to the gravity yields more wave-like patterns in the lower corona as\nshown by Figure 13 comparing with Figure 3.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussions\n\nFollowing the work of Forbes (1990), we used the ZEUS-2D code to perform a set of\nnumerical experiments for the dynamical properties of several phenomena associated with\nCMEs in the eruption. In our study, the magnetic configuration includes a current-carrying\nflue rope that models the filament, and the background field is equivalent to that produced\nby a line dipole located in the photosphere. The MHD equations applied to describe the\nprocess of interest are physically ideal, but in the numerical code that performs calculations\non the discrete grids, the numerical diffusion was inevitably invoked. We did not bother\nto remove this artificial effect since there is not an existing approach for the time being\nthat could eliminate the numerical diffusion properly, and this work mainly focuses on the\ndisrupting magnetic field and the associated phenomena.\nWe start the experiment with the state at which the system is not in equilibrium. So the\nflux rope rises rapidly at the very beginning. No current sheet forms from the reconnection\nregion because of the numerical diffusion. Although such a diffusion is somewhat artificial,\nit does not influence our results and conclusions.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nAs the flux rope propagates, a fast mode and a slow mode shocks may be produced in\nfront of it, a dimming area around the flux rope and the reconnection region appears and can\nbe easily recognized. As impact of the fast mode shock reaches the boundary surface, a pair\nof echoes developed from the footpoints of the fast shocks. But the slow mode shock decays\nquickly and totally dissipated somewhere in the corona, and does not reach the bottom\nboundary. In this process, magnetic field lines are apparently deformed by the velocity\nvortices as a result of the the flux rope motion (see Figure 6 and also Figure 10 of Forbes\n1990).\nMore details of these features are revealed by the velocity divergence \u2207 * v. Contour\nplots of \u2207 * v show more clearly the expansion of both the fast and the slow shocks, as well as\nthe echo formation with the fast shock reaching the bottom boundary. With its continuous\nexpansion, the fast shock sweeps the boundary surface at its footprints, manifesting a scenario\nof wave propagation at high speed, which reminds us the Moreton wave observed in the\nchromosphere.\nThe plot also shows very complex features in the region where the slow shocks mix with\nthe velocity vortices behind the flux rope. As noted by Forbes (1990), this region propagates\noutward roughly in horizontal direction as the flux rope moves upward. But as shown by\nFigure 5, no sign of either the vortices or the slow shock could be recognized on the bottom\nboundary. This implies that the vortices and the slow shock cannot cause disturbance to the\nlower atmosphere. Behaviors of the velocity vorticity \u2207 \u00d7 v further confirms this point.\nPlot of (\u2207 \u00d7 v)z versus x on the boundary surface of y = 0 displays the propagating\nfeature of the fast shock only (Figures 9a and 15a), but we see the slow shock disturbance\nat layer of 3 \u00d7 104 km above the boundary surface (Figures 9b and 15b), which is roughly\n0.3 scale height of the domain investigated. We also tried to explore signs of the slow shock\nand the velocity vortices in a lower layer, say of 2 \u00d7 104 km, but no sign was found, which\nis suggestive of disappearance of the impact of the slow shock and the velocity vortices in\nlower layers of the atmosphere. This result, together with the speed the slow shock (\u223c 40%\nthe fast shock speed) sweeps the corona horizontally, relates the EIT wave origin directly\nto the slow shock since observations yield almost the same result for altitude and the speed\nat which the EIT wave appears and propagates. Wills-Davey et al. (2007) went through\nexisting observational results and investigated new events, and they found that the layers\nwhere the EIT wave is most likely to appear are of the altitude of roughly 0.3 scale height\nof the coronal environment; Thompson & Myer (2009) showed that the EIT wave speed is\nusually 1/5 \u223c 1/3 that of Moreton wave.\nIn addition to assisting identifying the origin of the Moreton wave and that of the EIT\nwave, the above results is also helpful for understanding several correlations usually observed\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nin solar eruptions. These correlations include that of the EIT wave to the Moreton wave, that\nof the EIT wave to the type II radio burst, and that of the Moreton wave to the type II burst.\nOur results obtained here from the numerical experiment indicate the origin of the Moreton\nwave from the fast mode shock driven by the flux rope (CME), and both observations and\ntheories suggest the CME-driven shock origin of the type II radio burst as well (e.g., see Lin\net al. 2006 for a brief review). Therefore, a good correlation of the Moreton wave to the\ntype II radio burst is expected as indicated by many observations (e.g., see Wild et al. 1963;\nKai 1970; Uchida 1974; Pinter 1977; Cliver et al. 1999; Chen et al. 2005a). On the other\nhand, the EIT wave has different original source; it thus does not necessarily correlate to\nthe other two phenomena in an obvious fashion. This may account for the poor correlation\nof the EIT wave to the type II radio burst revealed by observations (e.g., see Klassen et al.\n2000 and Chen et al. 2005a).\n\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe numerical experiment provides us an approach to studying many evolutionary details in the disrupting magnetic field that could not be investigated in the framework of the\nanalytic solution. As indicated by the analytical model of CMEs (e.g., see Lin & Forbes 2000\nand references therein), the flux rope that is used to model the filament is thrust outward\nrapidly as the magnetic configuration loses the mechanical equilibrium in a catastrophic\nfashion. Fast motion of the flux rope quickly produces two types of shocks in front of it, and\na pair of velocity vortices behind it. We find for two cases that consequences of these shocks\nand vortices could well correspond to several important observational phenomena, including\nthe Moreton wave, EIT waves, coronal dimmings, and so on. Some issues that are still of\nactive research topics are also discussed. The main results are summarized as follows.\n1. As expected, a dimming region around the flux rope in the disrupting magnetic field\nforms. Its area expands in the eruptive process. Studying the plasma properties indicates\nthat the density in this area is apparently lower than the surroundings, and further confirms\nthat the dimming results from the depletion of the material in the relevant region.\n2. A fast mode shock forms forward of the flux rope as the eruption progresses. The\nshock expands toward its flank when propagating forward, and eventually reaches the lower\nlayer of the atmosphere, such as the chromosphere. An echo develops from the footpoints\nas a result of the shock being reflected from the boundary surface. Interaction between the\nfast shock and the lower layer results in disturbance, which accounts for the Moreton wave\nobserved in H\u03b1.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n3. A slow model shock is created as well at both sides of the flux rope when the fast\nshock forms, but leaves farther and farther behind the fast shock in the propagation. It also\nexpands toward its flank, but its impact cannot reach the bottom boundary. Instead the\ndisturbance it causes vanishes somewhere above the boundary.\n4. We also investigated the velocity vortices, and found that it usually forms slightly\nbelow the reconnection region, where the slow shock is able to reach. Our results suggest\nthat the joint impact of the slow shock and the vortices is quite likely to account for the EIT\nwaves.\n5. The CME-driven fast shock is the sole source of the metric type II radio burst, and\nthe Moreton wave is also a consequence of the CME-driven shock, not the flare-initiated\nblast wave. The same igniter of the Moreton wave and the type II burst explains the good\ncorrelation of these two phenomena to one another (Cliver et al. 1999). This, together with\nthe fact that the EIT wave is either the slow shock, or the velocity vortices, or both, in origin,\nfurther accounts for the lack of correlation of type II radio bursts to EIT waves (Klassen et\nal. 2000; Chen et al. 2005a).\n6. We also investigated the case in which the gravity is included, and found that existing\nof the gravity does not change our main results deduced from the case without the gravity.\nBut the stratification of the atmosphere due to the gravity yields much more complicated\npatterns of the disturbance created by shocks and the velocity vortices. Such disturbance\nin the layer above the bottom boundary displays apparent wave-like features. Considering\nthat the EIT wave appears roughly in the same layer, we conclude that the wave-like feature\nrevealed by our results is quite likely to account for the oscillatory property of the EIT wave\nobserved by Ballai et al. (2005) and Long et al. (2008).\nAuthors appreciate M. Zhang very much for teaching the key techniques of running\nthe ZEUS-2D code smoothly. They are also grateful to T. G. Forbes, P. Chen, G. D.

The highest\npeak in each panel represents the flux rope that includes the densest material. In the panel\nof t = 12 s, a slight increase in the density right forward of the flux rope begins to be\nrecognized, which indicates the formation of the fast mode shock. A region behind the shock\nand surrounding the flux rope, in which the density is lower than the background density,\ncorresponds to the dimming. The unit of time is second.\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Evolutions of the magnetic field and the plasma density as the eruption progresses.\nContinuous contours are magnetic field lines and the color shadings show the density distribution. Formation and development of the fast mode shock around the flux rope is clearly\nseen. The unit of time is second.

The left panel provides a\nlargescale view of both field and stream lines. Two regions surrounded by rectangles display\nareas in which the flow is strong and the magnetic field lines are apparently deformed. Details\nin these two regions can be seen more clearly in the enlarged panels on the right.\n\n\f\u2013 32 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.- A set of snapshots of \u2207 \u00d7v in the time interval between 50 s and 600 s. In addition\nto those features shown in Figure 4, an extra characteristic that can be recognized here is a\npair of the Petschek slow mode shocks developing from the reconnection region. The unit of\ntime is second. The right color bar represents values of the velocity divergence in arbitrary\nunit.\n\n\f\u2013 33 \u2013\n\nFig. 8.- The local magnetic field that includes both the flux rope and the X-point (marked\nby \u00d7) at t = 500 s (a), and the corresponding distribution of Bx on the y-axis (b).

The color shadings represent the distribution of\nvalues of \u2207 * v and (\u2207 \u00d7 v)z . The fast shock, slow shock, echo and vortices are denoted in\n(a). In panel (b), a pair of the Petschek slow shocks developing from the X-point is very\nimpressive.
