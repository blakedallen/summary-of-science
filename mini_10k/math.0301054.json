Introduction and Preliminary Notions\n1.1. Introduction. The techniques of symbolic dynamics have been applied with\nsignificant success in the study of one-dimensional discrete dynamical systems. In\nparticular, it is well known by now that the kneading sequence (i.e., the itinerary of\nthe critical point) is a complete topological invariant of a unimodal map defined on\nthe real unit interval. Over the last few years, several works have been devoted to\ngeneralize these techniques to two-dimensional dynamics with some success. However the main obstruction to construct a similar theory for mappings in the real\nplane is that they lack critical points in the usual sense and their dynamical space\ndoes not seem to have a natural order which a priori one-dimensional dynamics do\nhave. On this issue we recall the pruning front conjecture related to the H\u00e9non\nand Lozi mappings which can be encountered in the work of Cvitanovic et al. [6]\nand Ishii [9]. Their starting point is to regard a one-folding mapping of the plane\nas an incomplete horseshoe, and to measure its incompleteness compared with the\nfull horseshoe in terms of the pruning front and the primary pruned region which\nare a two-dimensional analogue of the kneading sequence.\nThe main purpose of this paper is to define symbolic dynamics for two-dimensional\ntriangular maps. Our approach is different from the pruning techniques, and basically consists of doing some operations (e.g. tensor products) between the onedimensional invariants in order to obtain two-dimensional topological invariants. To\nthe best of our knowledge, we are not aware of similar works related to kneading\ntheory for triangular maps. The class of continuous triangular maps we are considering, T (x, y) = (f (x) , gx (y)) , has the particularity of admiting finite critical\norbits for each one of the variables x, y, that is, both maps f and gx are multimodal,\nwhich leads to the result that the transition from dimension one to dimension two\nbecomes possible. More exactly, we develop a kneading theory and construct a\nMarkov partition for two-dimensional triangular maps. The kneading invariants\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDIANA A. MENDES AND J. SOUSA RAMOS\n\nfor these maps are obtained in Theorem 2.1 by doing a tensor product between the\nkneading matrices and polynomials associated with the one-dimensional basis map\nf and fiber map g. The Markov partition for the phase space of the triangular maps\n(see Theorem 3.1) is simply given by the cartesian product of the Markov partitions\non the x and y lines and the transition matrix is computed as the Kronecker product of the transition matrices corresponding to the one-dimensional components of\nthe triangular map. This is allowed since one of the variables evolves independently\nof the other, and in the case of a periodic orbit, the second variable becomes independent of the first one if the fiber map is considered to be the composition of the\nmap g at the periodic points of the orbit of map f . Finally, the connection between\nkneading theory and subshifts of finite type is shown in Theorem 4.1 by using a\ncommutative diagram derived from the homological configurations associated with\nm\u2212modal maps of the interval.\nThis work is based on three important results. The first one is the structure\nof periodic orbits of triangular maps due by Kloeden [14] and Alsed\u00e0 and Llibre\n[1]. The second is based on the notions of kneading theory for one-dimensional\nmultimodal maps due to Milnor and Thurston [20], and Lampreia and Sousa Ramos\n[15]. The third is based on the Kronecker product of matrices and on the tensor\nproduct of polynomials over a ring (see, e.g., [8]).\nAn immediate consequence of these results is the exact computation of the topological entropy [18] of two-dimensional triangular maps (see Corollary 2.1 and 3.1)\nand through this we can generalize the estimates for the topological entropy presented in [2]. All results are presented for two-dimensional triangular maps where\nthe basis map is unimodal, the fiber map is multimodal and the critical points\nof these maps are finite periodic points. For the case of eventually periodic and\naperiodic orbits see [19].\nIn the scientific literature the triangular maps are also frequently called by skewproduct maps. These maps have applications in geodesic flows on Riemannian\nsurfaces of constant negative curvature, in the study of strange attractors and in\ncertain polynomial endomorphisms of Cn . Some mathematical models which provide triangular maps are also found in physics and economics. The triangular maps\n(or skew-product maps) were largely studied in the context of ergodic properties.\nThis paper is organized as follows: Section 1 reviews some basic facts on triangular maps and tensor products. The main results concerning kneading theory and\nMarkov partitions for triangular maps are presented in Section 2 and 3. In Section\n4 we present the connection between kneading theory and subshifts of finite type\nand finally in Section 5 some examples are provided.\n1.2. Preliminary notions. Let X, Y be compact intervals of the real line. A\ntwo-dimensional triangular map is a continuous map of the form\nT (x, y) = (f (x) , g (x, y)) = (f (x) , gx (y)) ,\nwhere T : X \u00d7 Y \u2192 X \u00d7 Y splits the rectangle X \u00d7 Y in one-dimensional fibers\nYx = Y (x) = {x} \u00d7 Y for any x \u2208 X such that each fiber is mapped by T in a fiber.\nThe map f is called the basis map and g is called the fiber map. If we consider\nthat X = Y = I, where I is a compact interval of the real line, then\n\u0001 the set of all\ncontinuous maps from I 2 into itself will be denoted by C\u2206 I 2 , I 2 .\n\n\fKNEADING THEORY FOR TRIANGULAR MAPS\n\n3\n\nLet P = {x0 , x1 , . . . , xp\u22121 } be a p\u2212periodic orbit of f such that f (xi ) = xi+1 ,\nfor i = 0, . . . , p \u2212 2 and f (xp\u22121 ) = x0 . Define gP : Y \u2192 Y by\n(1.1)\n\ngP (y) = g (xp\u22121 , g (xp\u22122 , . . . , g (x1 , g (x0 , y)) ...)) .\n\nIf Q = {y0 , y1 , . . . , yq\u22121 } is a q\u2212periodic orbit of gP such that gP (yi ) = yi+1 , for\ni = 0, . . . , q \u2212 2 and gP (yq\u22121 ) = y0 , then we define the product of P by Q, denoted\nby P * Q, as follows. First we define a sequence of pq points in Y by setting\n\uf8f1\nif j = 0\n\uf8f2 yi\n(1.2)\ntip+j =\n\uf8f3\ng (xj\u22121 , tip+j\u22121 ) if j = 1, 2, . . . , p \u2212 1\nfor i = 0, 1, . . . , q \u2212 1. Now we define\n(1.3)\n\nP * Q = {(xj , tip+j ) : j = 0, 1, . . . , p \u2212 1 and i = 0, 1, . . . , q \u2212 1} ,\n\nor more explicitly\n(x0 , y0 )\n(x0 , y1 )\n..\n.\n\n(x1 , g (x0 , y0 ))\n(x1 , g (x0 , y1 ))\n..\n.\n\n(x0 , yq\u22121 ) (x1 , g (x0 , yq\u22121 ))\n\n...\n...\n..\n.\n\n(xp\u22121 , g (xp\u22122 , . . . , g (x1 , g (x0 , y0 )) . . .))\n(xp\u22121 , g (xp\u22122 , . . . , g (x1 , g (x0 , y1 )) . . .))\n..\n.\n\n...\n\n(xp\u22121 , g (xp\u22122 , . . . , g (x1 , g (x0 , yq\u22121 )) . . .)) .\n\nNote that P * Q \u2282 X \u00d7 Y and has cardinality pq.\nIt was shown by Kloeden [14] that the order of the coexisting cycles for interval\nmaps (Sharkovsky's order \" >s \") remains true for continuous triangular maps,\nthat is, for every s \u2208 N \u222a {2\u221e } there exists T \u2208 C\u2206 (X \u00d7 Y, X \u00d7 Y ) such that\nP er (T ) = S (s) , where P er (T ) denotes the set of all periods of T and S (s) =\n{k \u2208 N : s \u2265s k} . If P er (T ) = S (s) we say that the triangular map T has type s.\nIt is also know from Kloeden [14] that each periodic orbit of T can be decomposed\ninto a \"product\" of periodic orbits of f and gP , that is:\nLemma 1.1. Let T = (f, g) : X \u00d7 Y \u2192 X \u00d7 Y be a continuous triangular map.\nThen the following hold\n(1) If f has a periodic orbit P and gP has a periodic orbit Q, then P * Q is a\nperiodic orbit of T.\n(2) Conversely, each periodic orbit of T can be obtained as a product of a\nperiodic orbit P of f by a periodic orbit of gP .\nFrom these results, Alsed\u00e0 and Llibre [1] obtained a characterization of the possible sets of periods of triangular maps which is presented below. Before enunciating\nthe corollary, we specify that Orb (F ) denotes the set of all periodic orbits of a map\nF, and |R| denotes the period of an orbit R.\nCorollary 1.1. Let T = (f, g) : X \u00d7 Y \u2192 X \u00d7 Y be a continuous triangular map.\nThen\n[\n|P | * |Q| .\nP er (T ) =\nP \u2208Orb(f ),Q\u2208Orb(gP )\n\nWe will use Bowen's definition of topological entropy [5]. For a continuous triangular map T we set hf ib (T ) = supx\u2208X h (T, Yx ) to be the topological entropy of\nT on the fiber Yx . The Bowen formula for topological entropy bounds is satisfied,\ni.e.,\nmax {h (f ) , hf ib (T )} \u2264 h (T ) \u2264 h (f ) + hf ib (T )\n\n\f4\n\nDIANA A. MENDES AND J. SOUSA RAMOS\n\nwhere h (f ) , h (T ) denote the topological entropy for f and T . If all the fiber maps\ng are monotone, then h (T, Yx ) = 0 and h (T ) = h (f ) (see, e.g. [13]). If the basis\nmap f is simple (has at most type 2\u221e ), then h (T ) = hf ib (T ) .\nWe know that if T \u2208 C\u2206 (X \u00d7 Y, X \u00d7 Y ) is of type greater than 2\u221e then the\ntopological entropy of T is positive, if T is of type less than 2\u221e , the topological\nentropy is zero and if T is of type 2\u221e both cases are possible (see [11], [12] and\n[4]). Moreover it was found (see for example [2]) that there are triangular maps\nof type 2\u221e with h (T ) = \u221e and triangular maps of type 2\u221e with zero topological\nentropy which are strongly chaotic homeomorphism when restricted to a minimal\nset (see [7]), properties that are impossible for continuous maps on the interval.\nA characterization of the lower bounds of topological entropy for triangular maps\ndepending on the set of periods is given in [2].\nSome of the two-dimensional triangular maps for which our results apply are the\ngeneralizes Baker's transformation Ba,b : I 2 \u2192 I 2 , I = [0, 1], given by\n\uf8f1\n1\n\uf8f4\nif xn \u2264\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 (bxn , ayn ) ,\nb\nBa,b (xn , yn ) =\n,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 (bx \u2212 1, ay + (1 \u2212 a)) , if x \u2265 1\nn\nn\nn\nb\n2\nwhere 0 \u2264 a \u2264 1/2, b \u2208 R, the twisted horseshoe map Ha,b : I \u2192 I 2 , I = [0, 1] ,\n\uf8f1 \u0012\n\u0013\nxn\n1\nyn\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\naxn ,\n,\nif 0 \u2264 xn \u2264\n+\n+\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\na\nb\n2\na\n,\nHa,b (xn , yn ) =\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n1\ny\n1\nx\n\uf8f4\nn\nn\n\uf8f4\n, if\n+\n+\n\u2264 xn \u2264 1\n\uf8f3 a (1 \u2212 xn ) ,\na\nb\n2\na\nwith a, b real parameters and some type of Kaplan-Yorke map, which is given by\nKa,b,c (xn , yn ) = ((axn + b) mod 1, \u2212cyn + cos (2\u03c0xn )) ,\nwhere a, b, c are real parameters.\nNext we are going to define some notions related to tensor products of matrices\nand polynomials.\nDefinition 1.1.

The tensor\nproduct of A and B is a matrix C of type (mp \u00d7 nq) , represented by C = A \u2297 B\nand defined by\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\na11 B a12 B * * * a1n B\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n..\n..\n..\n..\nC =A\u2297B =\uf8f0\n\uf8fb.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nam1 B\n\nam2 B\n\n***\n\namn B\n\nThe tensor product of matrices is not in general commutative, that is A \u2297 B 6=\nB \u2297 A, and the following relations hold when dimensions are appropriate\n(A \u2297 B) * (C \u2297 D) = (A * C \u2297 B * D)\n(1.4)\n\n(A \u2297 B)T = AT \u2297 B T\ndet (An\u00d7n \u2297 Bm\u00d7m ) = (det (A))m * (det (B))n\ntrace (A \u2297 B) = trace (A) * trace (B)\nPA\u2297B (t) = PA (t) \u2297 PB (t) ,\n\nwhere PC (t) is the characteristic polynomial associated with a matrix C.\n\n\fKNEADING THEORY FOR TRIANGULAR MAPS\n\n5\n\n\u2217\n\nDefinition 1.2.

Kneading Theory\nIn what follows we define the symbolic dynamics necessary to develop the kneading theory of the two-dimensional triangular map T = (f, g) . We denote by TP =\n(f, gP ) the triangular map consisting of the basis map f and the fiber map gP ,\nwhere the latter is defined as in relation (1.1). Since we know that all the properties of the map TP = (f, gP ) pass on to the original triangular map T = (f, g) ,\nwe are going to study only the former map. In this section we are exclusively concerned with periodic orbits and finite matrices. We consider that the basis map f\nis unimodal and the fiber map gP is m\u2212modal. We define the necessary tools for\na general m\u2212modal map F.\nConsidering that the map F : X \u2192 X, where X = [a, b] is a compact interval\nof the real line, is a m\u2212modal map and denoting by ci , i = 1, . . . , m the m critical\npoints of F , we obtain the following orbits for the critical points for each values of\nthe parameters\no\nn\n(i)\n(i)\nO (ci ) = xj : xj = F j (ci ) , j \u2208 N, i = 1, . . . , m .\n(i)\n\nAfter a reordering of the elements xj of these orbits we get a partition {Xk = [zk , zk+1 ]}\nof the interval X = [a, b] . Next, we associate to each orbit O (ci ) a sequence of symbols s = S1 S2 . . . Sj . . . , where\n\uf8f1\nL\nif F j (ci ) < c1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 Ci\nif F j (ck ) = ci , i, k = 1, . . . , m\nSj =\n\uf8f4 Mi if ci < F j (ck ) < ci+1 , i = 1, . . . , m \u2212 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nR\nif F j (ci ) > cm .\nFor simplicity and without lack of generality we assume that the first and the last\ncritical points of the multimodal map F are maxima. This m\u2212modal map F and\nthe symbolic partition of the interval X are illustrated in Figure 1.\nThe set A = {L, C1 , M1 , C2 , M2 , . . . , Cm\u22121 , Mm\u22121 , Cm , R} will be the alphabet\nof the m\u2212modal map F .

MENDES AND J. SOUSA RAMOS\n\nIn what follows we suppose that the basis map f is unimodal and the map gP\nis m\u2212modal.

It follows that the triangular map has an orbit\nof period pq where q = q1 + . . . + qm .\nNow we are going to present the main result of this section, that is the characterization of the kneading invariants for a continuous triangular map.\nTheorem 2.1. Let X, Y be compact intervals of the real line and let T = (f, g) :\nX \u00d7 Y \u2192 X \u00d7 Y be a continuous triangular map. Assume that the basis map f\nhas a critical orbit P of period p and the map gP has m critical orbits Q1 , . . . , Qm\nof periods q1 , . . . , qm . Let us denote by Nf (t) and NgP (t) the kneading matrices\nassociated with the periodic orbits P and Qj , j = 1, . . . , m. Then, the kneading\nmatrix of T is given by the tensor product of NgP (t) and Nf (t) , that is\n(NT (t))(m\u00d72(m+1)) = (NgP (t))(m\u00d7(m+1)) \u2297 (Nf (t))(1\u00d72) ,\nand the kneading-determinant is given by\nDT (t) = DgP (t) \u2297 Df (t) .\nProof. We will divide the proof in two different cases which are related to the\nmodality of the fiber map. In the first case the map gP is unimodal and in the\nsecond case it is multimodal.\nCase 1: Let f : X \u2192 X, gP : Y \u2192 Y be unimodal maps and let us denote by cx\nand cy the corresponding critical points. We also denote by P the critical p\u2212period\norbit of f and by Q the critical q\u2212period orbit of gP .\nLet Ax = {Lx , Cx , Rx } , Ay = {Ly , Cy , Ry } be the alphabets corresponding to\nthe basis map and to the fiber map and suppose that\nsx(p) = (S1 . . .

It follows that the triangular map has an orbit P * Q of period pq.\nThe symbolic characterization of this orbit is given by the pair\n\u0012\u0010\n\u0011(p) \u0013\n\u0011(q) \u0010\nq\np \u221e\n(q)\n,\ns\n= ((S1 . . .

Denote\nby \u03b8x and \u03bd f (t) the invariant coordinate and the kneading increment of the map f .\nRecalling the relation (1.1) and using the p points of the P \u2212orbit of f we transform\n\n\fKNEADING THEORY FOR TRIANGULAR MAPS\n\n9\n\nthe fiber map g into an independently one-variable map gP (y) . We have already\nassumed that the map gP is unimodal and thus let us denote by \u03b8y and \u03bd gP (t) the\ninvariant coordinate and the kneading increment of this map. We recall that all\nthese kneading invariants are formal power series.\nLet Z [[t]] be the ring of formal power series with integer coefficients, and let V [[t]]\nand W [[t]] be the modules consisting of all formal power series with coefficients in\nthe vector spaces V and W . Thus each series \u03b8x = \u03b8 (x) and \u03b8y = \u03b8 (y) is an element\nof V [[t]] and W [[t]] respectively, which are free modules with basis {Lx , Rx } and\n{Ly , Ry } . In other words, we can uniquely express \u03b8 x and \u03b8 y as the following sums\n\u03b8x = \u03b81x Lx + \u03b82x Rx and \u03b8y = \u03b81y Ly + \u03b82y Ry ,\nwith coefficients \u03b81x , \u03b82x , \u03b81y , \u03b8 2y which are formal power series with integer coefficients.\nThen there exist a vector space V \u2297W and a bilinear function \u2297 : V \u00d7W \u2192 V \u2297W\nwith the following property: any bilinear function B : V \u00d7 W \u2192 U to any vector\nspace U over the integer field can be expressed in terms of \u2297 : V \u00d7 W \u2192 V \u2297 W as\nB (\u03b8 x , \u03b8y ) = (\u03b8x \u2297 \u03b8 y ) T\nfor a unique linear function T : V \u2297 W \u2192 U. So, bilinear functions from V \u00d7 W to\nU can naturally be considered as homomorphisms from V \u2297 W to U, and conversely\n(see Lang [17]).\nThis shows that the invariant coordinate \u03b8xy of the two dimensional triangular\nmap is given by\n\u03b8xy\n\n=\n=\n\n\u03b8x \u2297 \u03b8y = (\u03b8 1x Lx + \u03b8 2x Rx ) \u2297 (\u03b8 1y Ly + \u03b8 2y Ry )\n\u03b81x \u03b81y Lx Ly + \u03b8 1x \u03b8 2y Lx Ry + \u03b8 2x \u03b81y Rx Ly + \u03b82x \u03b82y Rx Ry .\n\nNote that the vector space U has the following base {Lx Ly , Lx Ry , Rx Ly , Rx Ry }\nand the kneading invariant of the triangular map is now given by\nxy\nxy\nxy\nxy\n\u03bd xy (t) = N11\n(t) Lx Ly + N12\n(t) Lx Ry + N13\n(t) Rx Ly + N14\n(t) Rx Ry .\n\nIt follows immediately that the kneading matrix is of type (1 \u00d7 4) and is given\nby the tensor product of the kneading matrices associated with the one dimensional\nmaps, that is\n\uf8ee xy\n\uf8f9T \uf8ee y\n\uf8f9T\nx\nN11 (t)\n(t)\nN11 (t) \u2297 N11\n\uf8ef xy\n\uf8ef y\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\nx\n\uf8ef N12 (t) \uf8fa\n\uf8ef N (t) \u2297 N12\n(t) \uf8fa\n\uf8fa = \uf8ef 11\n\uf8fa\n(NT (t))1\u00d74 = \uf8ef\n\uf8ef N xy (t) \uf8fa\n\uf8ef N y (t) \u2297 N x (t) \uf8fa\n\uf8f0 13\n\uf8f0 12\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fb\n11\nxy\ny\nx\n(t)\nN14\n(t)\n(t) \u2297 N12\nN12\n\u0002 y\n\u0003 \u0002 x\n\u0003\ny\nx\nN11 (t) N12\n(t) \u2297 N11\n(t) N12\n(t)\n=\n=\n\n(NgP (t))1\u00d72 \u2297 (Nf (t))1\u00d72 .\n\nThe entries of the kneading matrices are polynomials and so, when we construct\nthe tensor product of these matrices, the new entries of the resulting matrix are\nalso given by tensor products of polynomials.\nThe kneading determinant can be computed directly from the kneading matrix\nNT (t) which is equal to the tensor product of the kneading determinants of the\n\n\f10\n\nDIANA A.

The proof is immediate by considering the kneading matrix constructed in\nthe previous theorem, that is\n(NT (t))m\u00d72(m+1) = (NgP (t))m\u00d7(m+1) \u2297 (Nf (t))1\u00d72 .\nIt follows that the kneading determinant is given by\nDT (t) = DgP (t) \u2297 Df (t) ,\nand since the topological entropy of the map f is given by log (1/t\u2217x) where t\u2217x\nis the smallest positive solution\nof Df (t) and the topological entropy of the map\n\u0001\ngP is given by log 1/t\u2217y where t\u2217y is the smallest positive solution of DgP (t), it\n\u0001\nfollows that (1/t\u2217 ) = (1/t\u2217x ) 1/t\u2217y is the smallest positive solution of DT (t) (see\n\u0001\nequation (1.5)) and log (1/t\u2217 ) = log (1/t\u2217x ) + log 1/t\u2217y is the topological entropy of\nthe triangular map.\nRemark 2.1. When the orbits of the critical points are eventually periodic, similar\nresults hold (see [19]). For the aperiodic case we need to use kneading operators (see\nalso [19]).\n3. Subshifts of Finite Type\nIt is well known that the class of maps studied in the previous section admits a\nMarkov partition which is determined by the itineraries of the critical points. Once\nwe have a Markov partition, a subshift of finite type is determined by a transition\nm\nmatrix. Given a Markov partition R = {Rj }j=1 , the transition matrix A = (aij )\nof type (m \u00d7 m) is defined by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 1 if int (f (Ri )) \u2229 int (Rj ) 6= \u2205\naij =\n.\n\uf8f3\n0 if int (f (Ri )) \u2229 int (Rj ) = \u2205\nThe subshift space for A is defined as\n\b\n\u03a3A = s : N \u2192 {1, 2, . . . , m} : asi si+1 = 1 .\n\nN\n\nLetting \u03c3 be the shift map on the full m\u2212shift, \u03a3m = {1, 2, . . . , m} , define \u03c3 A =\n\u03c3 |\u03a3A : \u03a3A \u2192 \u03a3A .\n\n\fKNEADING THEORY FOR TRIANGULAR MAPS\n\n11\n\nLet us denote by Rx , Ry , Ax , Ay the Markov partitions and the transition matrices associated with the one-dimensional basis map f and fiber map gP . Then\nthe following theorem holds:\nTheorem 3.1. Let X, Y be compact intervals of the real line and let T = (f, g) \u2208\nC\u2206 (X \u00d7 Y, X \u00d7 Y ) be a continuous triangular map. Suppose that the basis map f\nadmits a critical orbit P of finite period p and the fiber map gP admits m critical\norbits Q1 , . . . , Qm of finite periods q1 , . . . , qm . Then the Markov partition of the\nmap TP is given by the cartesian product Rx \u00d7 Ry and the transition matrix A of\nTP is given by the following tensor product: A = Ay \u2297 Ax .\nProof. Suppose that m = 1 and therefore the maps f and gP are unimodal. Let\nus denote by P the period p critical orbit of f and by Q the period q critical orbit\nof gP . Then the interval X (on the x axis of the real plane) is divided in p \u2212 1\nintervals and the interval Y (on the y axis of the real plane) is divided in q \u2212 1\nintervals. It follows that Rx = {X1 , . . . , Xp\u22121 } and Ry = {Y1 , . . . , Yq\u22121 } are the\nMarkov partitions generated by the two unimodal maps. This way the real plane\nis divided in (p \u2212 1) \u00d7 (q \u2212 1) rectangles Ri , i = 1, . . . , (p \u2212 1) (q \u2212 1), which define\nthe Markov partition of the two-dimensional map TP , since the image of an initial\nrectangle Ri either fully covers a region Rj in one iteration or misses it altogether.\nThis is guarantied by continuity and by the property that horizontal lines go into\nhorizontal lines and vertical lines go into vertical lines by following the rules of the\nmaps f and gP .\nTo obtain the transition matrix A of the triangular map we can proceed in two\ndifferent ways. The first way is to obtain a (p \u2212 1) (q \u2212 1) \u00d7 (p \u2212 1) (q \u2212 1) matrix directly from the allowed transitions between the rectangles Ri of the Markov\npartition, and subsequently one can obtain the same matrix by doing the tensor\nproduct of the transition matrices associated with each one of the one-dimensional\nmaps that compose the triangular map, that is\n(A)(p\u22121)(q\u22121)\u00d7(p\u22121)(q\u22121) = (Ay )(q\u22121)\u00d7(q\u22121) \u2297 (Ax )(p\u22121)\u00d7(p\u22121) .\nThese follow by the same arguments as those used in the main theorem of the\nprevious section. The case of multimodal maps follows in the same way.\nCorollary 3.1. Suppose that all the hypothesis of the previous theorem are fulfilled.\nThen the topological entropy of a continuous triangular map T = (f, g) \u2208 C\u2206 (X \u00d7 Y, X \u00d7 Y )\nis given by the sum of the topological entropies of the basis map f and the map gP ,\nthat is\nh (T ) = h (f ) + h (gP ) .\nProof. Since the transition matrix of the map TP is given by the tensor product\nof the transition matrices associated with the one-dimensional maps f and gP , it\nfollows that the characteristic polynomial of the map TP is also given by the tensor\nproduct of the corresponding characteristic polynomials of maps f and gP (this\nfollows from property (1.4) of the tensor product of matrices). Denoting by \u03bbx and\n\u03bby the maximal eigenvalues of the matrices Ax and Ay it follows that\nh (TP ) = h (T ) = log (\u03bbx * \u03bby ) = log \u03bbx + log \u03bby = h (f ) + h (gP ) .\nThis ends the proof.\n\n\f12\n\nDIANA A. MENDES AND J. SOUSA RAMOS\n\nRemark 3.1. Between the characteristic polynomial PA (t) = det (I \u2212 tA) of the\ntransition matrix A and the kneading determinant of the matrix NT (t) , DT (t) ,\nthe following relation exists\nPA (t) = DT (t) Pcyc (t) = dT (t) ,\nwhere Pcyc (t) is a product of cyclotomic polynomials (see equation (2.2)). This\nconfirms the same value for the topological entropy h (T ) = log (1/t\u2217 ) by using both\nmethods presented in Corollary 2.1 and Corollary 3.1.\n4. Connections between Kneading Theory and Subshifts of Finite\nType\nIn this section we show the connection between kneading theory and subshifts\nof finite type by using a commutative diagram derived from the homological configurations associated with m\u2212modal maps of the interval.\nFor this purpose we consider again the m\u2212modal\n\u0010 map F : X\u0011\u2192 X which we\n(p )\n(p )\nalready presented in Section 2.
