Our sample consists of 4576\nquasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) that were chosen using homogeneous\nselection criteria. Expanding on our previous work which demonstrated that the optical/UV color distribution of quasars is roughly Gaussian, but with a red tail, here\nwe distinguish between 1) quasars that have intrinsically blue (optically flat) power-law\ncontinua, 2) quasars that have intrinsically red (optically steep) power-law continua,\nand 3) quasars whose colors are inconsistent with a single power-law continuum. We\nfind that 273 (6.0%) of the quasars in our sample fall into the latter category and\nappear to be redder because of SMC-like dust extinction and reddening rather than\nbecause of synchrotron emission.

The change in strength\nof the 3000 \u00c5 bump appears to be dominated by the Balmer continuum and not by\nFe II emission. The dust reddened quasars have even narrower Balmer lines and weaker\n3000 \u00c5 bumps, in addition to having considerably larger equivalent widths of [O II] and\n[O III] emission. The fraction of broad absorption line quasars (BALQSOs) increases\nfrom \u223c 3.4% for the bluest quasars to perhaps as large as 20% for the dust reddened\nquasars, but the intrinsic color distribution will be much bluer if all BALQSOs are\naffected by dust reddening.\nSubject headings: quasars: general - quasars: emission lines - quasars: absorption\nlines\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe existence of a significant population of red quasars has been the subject of debate for\na number of years. The color distribution of quasars (Webster et al. 1995; Francis, Whiting, &\nWebster 2000; Brotherton et al. 2001; Richards et al. 2001) and the discovery of a few examples of\nhighly reddened radio-selected quasars (Gregg et al. 2002; White et al. 2003) strongly suggest that\na sizeable population of such objects does indeed exist. Nevertheless, it is still unclear how often\ndifferent mechanisms (e.g., dust extinction, a synchrotron emission turnover, or simply intrinsic\ncontinuum differences) are at work, whether this class of objects is a significant fraction of the\ntotal quasar population, and whether moderately dust reddened Type 1 quasars are significant\ncontributors to the X-ray background (Mushotzky et al. 2000; Brandt et al. 2000) - independent of\nthe contribution of Type 2 quasars with completely obscured broad emission line regions (BELRs).\nPart of the reason that these issues are not better understood may be the heterogeneous\ndefinitions that have been used to classify quasars as \"red\". This paper suggests that traditional\nsamples of red quasars that impose cuts on observed colors or spectral index (e.g., Webster et al.\n1995; Francis et al. 2001; Wilkes et al. 2002; Gregg et al. 2002) are too heterogeneous with redshift\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nto yield physically homogeneous samples of red quasars. Spectral indices are sensitive to the choice\nof continuum windows, and simple color cuts necessarily ignore the significant contribution that\nemission and absorption lines make to the colors of quasars as a function of redshift. That is not\nto say that such red quasar criteria are not reasonable, but rather that care must be taken in\nthe interpretation of such samples after the fact. Herein we address these issues with a sample of\nquasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000). Using this sample, we present\na more redshift-independent selection criterion for red quasars that allows for better classification\nof the types (and causes) of red quasars, which, in turn, will lead to a better census of the quasar\npopulation in the future.\nWe demonstrate that the distribution of optical colors of normal quasars is resolved by the\nSDSS and we isolate quasars as a function of optical color. The majority of our quasars are\nconsistent with a roughly Gaussian distribution in color that can be characterized by a Gauassian\ndistribution in spectral index. For these quasars, which have colors that are roughly consistent with\na single power-law continuum, the fact that our photometric errors are smaller than the width of\nthe distribution allows us to differentiate between those quasars that have bluer than average colors\n(hereafter referred to as \"optically flat\" quasars) and quasars that have slightly redder than average\ncolor - but still blue in an absolute sense - hereafter referred to as \"optically steep\" quasars. In\naddition, there is a red tail to the distribution beyond that which can be explained by a Gaussian\ndistribution in spectral index. These quasars that have continua with curvature that cannot be\nexplained by a single power-law slope; they appear reddened as a result of a decrement of blue flux\nsuch as might result from dust extinction and are referred to hereafter as \"dust reddened\" quasars.\nQuasars can also appear redder than average as a result of an excess of red flux such as might result\nfrom the presence of a synchrotron source with a high-frequency turnover in the rest-frame UV or\noptical, such quasars are referred to hereafter as \"red synchrotron\" quasars; Serjeant & Rawlings\n1997; Francis et al. 2000). See \u00a7 3.2 and \u00a7 4.1 for figures that help with visual clarification of our\nflat/steep/dusty nomenclature.\nOur analysis of reddened quasars discusses whether the heavily reddened quasars in the literature are just the tail of a population dominated by less reddened quasars, or if there is an equal\ndistribution of extreme, moderate, and mild reddening, or if the distribution is bimodal with reddening. We demonstrate that the SDSS quasar survey is sensitive to moderately dust reddened\nquasars (0.1 . E(B \u2212 V ) . 0.5) and that this sensitivity allows us to comment on the population of\neven more heavily reddened, but otherwise normal Type 1 quasars. We cannot, however, comment\non the extent of the heavily obscured Type 2 quasar population using this data set.\nFurther analysis of the color distribution of quasars and the relationship of the emission and\nabsorption line properties to optical/UV color may prove useful in determining the underlying\nphysics of AGN. For example, it has become popular to probe the physical characteristics of quasars\nsuch as the black hole mass, luminosity, and accretion rate through eigenvector-type analyses\n(Boroson & Green 1992; Wills et al. 1999; Sulentic et al. 2002). Such analyses attempt to relate\ndifferent quasar observables to each other and to determine which physical mechanisms might\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\ncause such correlations. In this paper, we specifically examine the relationship of optical/UV color\nto some of those emission and absorption line properties that are used in eigenvector analysis,\nespecially since optical/UV color has not been one of the primary properties used in such analyses\n(Brotherton & Francis 1999).\nIn \u00a7 2 we describe the dataset used herein and discuss the ability of the SDSS to find red\nquasars. Section 3 presents the method by which we divide quasars into color samples and also\npresents our definition of an apparently dust reddened quasar. Section 4 presents and examines\ncomposite quasar spectra as a function of color. A discussion is presented in \u00a7 5, and conclusions\nare given in \u00a7 6.\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nThe Data\n\nSample Definition\n\nThe quasars were selected for SDSS spectroscopic followup from the SDSS imaging survey\nwhich uses a wide-field multi-CCD camera (Gunn et al. 1998); quasar candidates were identified\nusing the SDSS Quasar Target Selection Algorithm (Richards et al. 2002a). Objects were selected\nbased on their broad-band SDSS colors (Fukugita et al. 1996; Lupton, Gunn, & Szalay 1999; Hogg\net al. 2001; Smith et al. 2002; Stoughton et al. 2002) and as optical matches to radio-detected\nquasars from the VLA \"FIRST\" survey (Becker, White, & Helfand 1995), although the objects\nare primarily radio quiet (Ivezi\u0107 et al. 2002). The automated extraction of point-spread-function\nmagnitudes from the images is discussed by Lupton et al. (2001), and Pier et al. (2003) present\nthe details of the SDSS astrometric solution. Magnitudes (and therefore colors) in this paper have\nbeen corrected for Galactic reddening using the reddening maps from Schlegel, Finkbeiner, & Davis\n(1998). The quasar spectra cover 3800 \u00c5 to 9200 \u00c5 at a resolution of 1800 to 2000. The spectra are\ncalibrated to spectrophotometric standard F-stars and are thus corrected for Galactic reddening\n(at the scale of the separation to the nearest calibration star, . 1 deg) in the limit that these F\nstars are behind the dust in the Galaxy. The spectrophotometric calibration includes scaling by\nwider aperture \"smear\" exposures to the photometry from the imaging data. See Stoughton et al.\n(2002) for more details regarding the spectroscopic system and analysis pipelines. A discussion of\nthe spectroscopic tiling algorithm can be found in Blanton et al. (2002).\nThe quasars used in this paper are the first SDSS quasars to be selected in a homogeneous\nmanner using the algorithm described in detail by Richards et al. (2002a); most SDSS quasars to\ndate were selected with an older version of the algorithm (see Stoughton et al. 2002). This sample\nis magnitude limited to i\u2217 = 19.112 . We supplement our main sample by including quasars that\nwere observed as part of the SDSS Southern Survey (which is designed to go deeper than the Main\n12\n\nThe data used herein use preliminary photometric calibrations, thus we follow the convention of Stoughton et al.\n(2002) and use, for example, i\u2217 , to refer to measured magnitudes and i to refer to the filters themselves.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nSurvey) during the fall of 2001. These quasars were also selected with the algorithm described\nby Richards et al. (2002a) except that we relaxed some of the constraints. Quasar candidates\nwere selected to i\u2217 = 19.9 (for both color and radio selection) and we did not bias against some\nhigh contamination regions of color space (e.g., where white dwarfs are found). Between the two\nsamples, there are 5803 quasars with Mi\u2217 < \u221223 (Ho = 50 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9 = 1, \u039b = 0, \u03b1\u03bd = \u22120.5\n[f\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b1\u03bd ]) that had at least one emission line broader than 1000 km s\u22121 FWHM. These quasars\ncome from 147 spectroscopic plates (which are 3 degrees in diameter and hold 640 spectroscopic\nfibers) covering an area of \u223c 600 deg2 . To define a sample that is as homogeneous as possible and\nthat is not contaminated by light from the host galaxy or the absence of flux in the Ly\u03b1 forest, we\nwill further restrict the sample to 0.3 \u2264 z \u2264 2.2, leaving 4576 quasars in our sample (639 of which\nare fainter than i\u2217 = 19.1).\n\n2.2.\n\nThe SDSS's Sensitivity to Red/Reddened Quasars\n\nMany previous (and current) optical surveys of quasars are somewhat biased against red\nquasars - and especially dust reddened quasars - because they are magnitude-limited at the\nblue end of the optical spectrum (e.g., the B band at 4400 \u00c5). The SDSS, on the other hand, is\nmagnitude limited in the i band (\u03bbeff \u2248 7460 \u00c5 for a quasar with optical spectral index \u03b1\u03bd = \u22120.5).\nAs a result, the SDSS is more sensitive to dust reddened quasars since their spectral shapes are a\nstrong function of wavelength. In addition, the SDSS photometric errors are much smaller than the\nerrors of the photographic photometry used for other wide-area optical surveys of quasars. These\nsmaller errors mean that there is less scatter in the stellar locus and thus less of quasar parameter\nspace is contaminated by stars. Second, to the extent allowed by a limited number of spectroscopic\nfibers, we consider objects outside of the stellar locus (in color space) to be quasar candidates,\nthus we are sensitive to quasars with \"nonstandard\" colors; see Richards et al. (2002a) for details.\nFinally, the wide wavelength coverage and high quality of the SDSS spectra allow us to identify\nquasars with unusual spectral energy distributions.\nFigure 11 of Richards et al. (2002a) showed the completeness of the SDSS quasar target\nselection algorithm as a function of redshift and absolute magnitude for 53,000 simulated quasars\n(Fan 1999) with a Gaussian distribution of spectral indices, \u03b1\u03bd = \u22120.5 \u00b1 0.3. We test the SDSS's\nsensitivity to optically steep quasars and dust reddened quasars by modifying the colors of this\ninitial sample. To create a test sample of optically steep quasars, we have simply shifted the median\nof the power law spectral index of the 53,000 simulated quasar colors to \u03b1\u03bd = \u22121.5. To simulate\ndust reddened quasars, we reddened and extincted the colors using a SMC-like dust reddening law\n(Prevot et al. 1984) with the form R\u03bb \u2261 A\u03bb /E(B \u2212 V ) = 1.39\u03bb\u22121.2 , where \u03bb is in microns and the\ndust is located at the redshift of the quasar.\nThe results of running these simulated optically steep and dust reddened quasars through the\nSDSS's quasar target selection algorithm (Richards et al. 2002a) are shown in Figure 1. The\ncontours show the likelihood of selecting a quasar at a given redshift and Mi\u2217 ; the shaded regions\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nare parts of the parameter space that are not explored by these simulations. We find that even\noptically steep quasars with \u03b1\u03bd = \u22121.5 and moderately dust reddened quasars with E(B \u2212V ) = 0.1\n(characteristic of our dust reddened quasar criterion, see \u00a7 3.4) have high selection probabilities\nin the SDSS. For \u03b1\u03bd = \u22121.5, the detection probability is over 90% for the entire redshift range\nconsidered in this paper (0.3 < z < 2.2). Even for E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.1, the detection probability is\nat least 90% for the z . 2 quasars studied herein and also for z & 3.5 quasars. The sensitivity of\nthe SDSS for high-redshift quasars that are redder than average is particularly good since their red\ncolors move them away from the colors of stars.\nUnder certain circumstances, the SDSS is also sensitive to more heavily dust reddened quasars.\nThe dynamic range of the SDSS quasar target selection algorithm is approximately 4 magnitudes\n(15.0 < i\u2217 < 19.1) for z . 3, so at z = 2, we are sensitive to intrinsically luminous quasars with\nE(B \u2212 V ) at least as large as 0.54. In most cases, such heavily reddened quasars will be extincted\nout of our sample, but they may still be discovered by the SDSS if their unreddened magnitude\nis i\u2217 < 15 (the SDSS bright limit for spectroscopy) and dust causes them to be extincted into our\nsample. Quasars as intrinsically bright as i\u2217 < 15 are rare, but there will be enough of them in\nthe area of sky covered by the SDSS that we can use them to comment on the extent of heavily\nreddened, but otherwise normal, broad-lined quasars.\nTwo examples probe the ability of the SDSS to detect extremely reddened quasars that are\nextincted by E(B \u2212 V ) \u223c 0.5. PMN 0134\u22120931 (z = 2.2, i\u2217 = 19.65) is a heavily reddened,\nE(B \u2212 V ) \u223c 0.54, gravitationally lensed quasar (Gregg et al. 2002; Winn et al. 2002) recovered\nby the griz branch of the SDSS color selection algorithm; see Hall et al. (2002b). Although this\nquasar is magnified by lensing, it still demonstrates the ability of the SDSS to find intrinsically\nluminous, dust reddened quasars. Perhaps more noteworthy in the context of this paper is the\nSDSS's recovery of FIRST J0738+2750 (Gregg et al. 2002), an unlensed z = 1.985 quasar that is\ninternally reddened by E(B \u2212 V ) \u223c 0.5. Both quasars are fainter than the magnitude limit of the\nMain Survey, but are bright enough to be included in the deeper extension of the spectroscopic\nsurvey in the southern equatorial region. Even more heavily reddened and/or obscured quasars,\nincluding broad absorption line quasars, such as those presented by Hall et al. (2002a), may not\nalways be classified as quasars by the automated SDSS pipelines as a result of their unusual spectra;\nsee \u00a7 3.4.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nDefining Quasar Samples as a Function of Color\nObserved-Color Selection and Redshift Heterogeneity\n\nRed quasars are typically searched for using a simple color cut in the observed frame, such\nas B \u2212 K & 5. In the upper left hand panel of Figure 2 we illustrate such an observed frame\ncolor cut (specfically, u\u2217 \u2212 g\u2217 = 0.6). Although such a criterion does indeed select quasars that\nare apparently red, it fails to distinguish between four possible cases: (1) that the quasar has an\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nintrinsically red power-law continuum (i.e., is intrinsically optically steep), (2) that the quasar is\nreddened by dust extinction, (3) that the quasar has excess synchrotron emission, and (4) that the\nredshift of the quasar is such that the quasar appears to be redder than normal because of strong\nemission or absorption in one of the bands (e.g., Ly\u03b1 emission, absorption by the Ly\u03b1 forest, or\nBAL troughs). A further example is that of Figure 5 of Barkhouse & Hall (2001) in which they\ndemonstrate that while using J \u2212 K > 2.0 as a color-cut may well select dust reddened quasars, it\nalso selects perfectly normal, if somewhat optically steep, quasars with z < 0.5. Thus it is perhaps\nnot unexpected that follow-up X-ray observations of such a sample of \"red\" quasars (Wilkes et al.\n2002) finds heterogeneous X-ray properties among red quasars selected in this manner.\nThere are similar problems with defining red quasars according to spectral indices. For example\nGregg et al. (2002), suggest \u03b1 < \u22121 (f\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 ) as an appropriate definition of a red quasar.\nThe problem with this approach is that most spectra do not have enough wavelength coverage\nfor redshift-independent spectral index determination. Vanden Berk et al. (2001) found that\nthere were good continuum windows only at \u223c 1450 \u00c5 and \u223c 4000 \u00c5; most other commonly used\nwindows are contaminated by Fe II emission. These wavelength regions are only seen simultaneously\nat 1.30 \u2264 z \u2264 1.62 even in the SDSS spectra, which have broader wavelength coverage than do\nmost other optical quasar studies. Furthermore, the optical spectral index of quasars is a function\nof the continuum windows used, and therefore depends on redshift (see, e.g., Vanden Berk et al.\n2001; Schneider et al. 2002; Pentericci et al. 2003). Finally, using the spectral index can fail\nto distinguish between quasars that are intrinsically optically steep and quasars that are dust\nreddened. Dust reddened quasars will have spectral curvature that a simple power-law fit will be\nunable to characterize.\nObserved-color selection is clearly necessary when initiating a follow-up campaign when the\nredshifts are not yet known. However, interpretation of results from red quasar samples requires\nthe construction of good statistical samples that are independent of redshift. Thus, it is clear that\nit would be very useful to have a definition for a \"red\" quasar that takes redshift into account.\nIn particular, we desire a simple but effective selection criterion that depends only on the SDSS\nphotometry (given a redshift), yet correlates strongly with the overall optical/UV spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of quasars independent of the effect of emission lines. We will show that statistically significant differences in the optical/UV continua of quasars are reflected in their relative\ncolors (the colors referenced to the median color at a given redshift; see below). We also demonstrate these relative colors can be used to distinguish between intrinsically optically steep quasars\nand dust reddened quasars.\n\n3.2.\n\nRest Frame Selection Using Relative Colors\n\nRather than determining the continuum color of our quasars by measuring a spectral index\nfrom each spectrum, we determine the underlying continuum color by subtracting the median colors\nof quasars at the redshift of each quasar from the measured colors of each quasar; we will refer\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nto this difference as a relative color (Richards et al. 2001).13 Figure 2 shows the measured and\nmedian colors as a function of redshift in bins of \u2206z = 0.01 for the SDSS quasars in our sample.\nAs shown by Richards et al. (2001), the features in the color-redshift diagrams can be understood\nas being due to emission lines moving in and out of the filters. For redshifts between z = 0.6 and\nz = 2.2, we expect the colors of quasars to be dominated by their power law continua and emission\nlines (as opposed to light from the host galaxy for z < 0.6 and Ly\u03b1 forest absorption for z > 2.2).\nWe also chose to include quasars with 0.3 < z < 0.6 so that we sampled both H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 (in an\nattempt to study the Balmer decrement); however, in the end, the H\u03b1 line was too poorly sampled\nto measure Balmer decrements.\nFigure 3 depicts the distributions of the relative colors. The gray points give the individual\nrelative colors as a function of redshift; see Richards et al. (2001) for similar plots as a function\nof apparent and absolute magnitude. There are no trends in \u2206(g\u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 ) with position on the\nsky or Schlegel et al. (1998) Galactic reddening. Furthermore, these color distributions are not\npredominantly due to photometric errors; the distributions are formally resolved. For example, the\nFWHM of the \u2206(r \u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 ) distribution is \u223c 0.2 and even at i\u2217 \u223c 19 the photometric error in r \u2217 \u2212 i\u2217\nis typically only \u223c 0.025 (FWHM \u223c 0.06). As a result, we can meaningfully distinguish between\nblue (optically flat) and red (optically steep) quasars.\nAs we shall discuss below, from Figure 3 it is quite clear that there is a tail of red quasars\nwhich is particularly pronounced in colors involving the u or g filters. (This tail was previously\nseen in a smaller SDSS sample by Richards et al. 2001.) This tail indicates that the scatter in the\ncolors of quasars is not a simple Gaussian distribution around the median color as can be seen in\nthe lower right hand panel of Figure 3 where we show that a Gaussian distribution (dotted line)\ncan be made to match the blue extent of the distribution, but not the red.\n\n3.3.\n\nPhotometric Spectral Indices\n\nTo determine the overall optical/UV SEDs of our quasars, we fit a power-law to the five\nSDSS photometric data points in a manner similar to that described by Whiting, Webster, &\nFrancis (2001). Instead of using the observed photometric data points, which will deviate from the\nunderlying power-law continuum because of emission and absorption features, we make use of the\nrelative colors. First, we normalize all of the quasars to have the same apparent i band magnitude\nsince we are only interested in the slope and shape of the continuum. Then we compute the other\nrelative magnitudes from the relative colors. In essence, we have applied a k-correction for the\nemission lines. To determine the spectral index from the relative magnitudes, mrel , we utilized the\nerror-weighted linear least-squares fitting routine from Press et al. (1992) and solved for what we\n13\n\nWe choose not to call this difference a \"color excess\", since color excesses are defined to be positive, whereas\nrelative colors can be either positive or negative; see Figure 3. Note that previously, in Richards et al. (2001), we\nreferred to it as the normalized color.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nrefer to as the photometric spectral index, \u03b1p , according to\n\u22120.4 \u00d7 mrel = \u03b1p log \u03bb + C.\n\n(1)\n\nusing the original magnitude errors as measured in each band and effective wavelengths of 3541,\n4653, 6147, 7461, and 8904 \u00c5 in ugriz (appropriate for a power-law continuum with \u03b1\u03bb = \u22121.5 and\nf\u03bb \u221d \u03bb\u03b1 ). By subtracting the median quasar color from all the observed colors, we have essentially\ndefined the relative magnitudes such that the median quasar will now have f\u03bb \u221d \u03bb\u22122 (i.e., \u03b1\u03bd \u2261 0).\nThe solid line in the left panel of Figure 4 shows the resulting distribution of photometric\nspectral indices, while the dashed line shows the spectral index distributions derived from fitting\na power-law to the observed magnitudes in a manner similar to Whiting et al. (2001). The mean\noffset between the distributions is irrelevant; it merely arises because the relative colors are defined\nto have a median of \u03b1p = \u22122. The right panel of Figure 4 shows the difference between photometric\nspectral indices using relative magnitudes and observed magnitudes as a function of redshift. Even\nthough both indices recover the tail of red quasars, it is clear that failure to correct for redshift\ndependent color effects can lead to erroneous photometric spectral indices, where the errors result\nfrom not accounting for emission and absorption features (especially the small blue bump) and are\nsystematic with redshift.\n\n3.4.\n\nUsing Relative Colors To Define Color Samples\n\nHaving determined the broad-band SEDs of our quasars, we now ask if we can find a cut (or\ncuts) using relative colors that can serve as a surrogate for the procedure of finding the photometric\nspectral index. Surprisingly, the relative u\u2217 \u2212 g\u2217 color, \u2206(u\u2217 \u2212 g\u2217 ), is not a very good discriminator\ndespite the large spread in that distribution (see the lower right inset of Fig. 5). The observed\ncolors also do not serve as an adequate surrogate for spectral index. The upper left-hand panel of\nFigure 5 shows that observed g \u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 indeed is correlated with spectral index, but is broadened by\nredshift effects. For example, a z = 1.5 quasar with g \u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 = 0.2 predicts a much bluer (flatter)\nspectral index than a z = 0.8 quasar with the same observed color. On the other hand, both the\nrelative colors \u2206(g\u2217 \u2212 r \u2217 ) and \u2206(r \u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 ) correlate well with the photometric spectral index and\nhave much less scatter than the observed colors. The combination of the two, \u2206(g\u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 ), is an\nexcellent redshift-independent surrogate for the photometric spectral index at z < 2.2 as can be\nseen in the main panel of Figure 5.\nThe quantity \u2206(g \u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 ) can also be used to distinguish between quasars in the red tail and\noptically steep quasars (at least in a statistical sense). Figure 3 shows that the distribution of\nrelative r \u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 and i\u2217 \u2212 z \u2217 colors is roughly Gaussian and symmetric. If the distribution of\ncolors were purely the result of a roughly Gaussian distribution of power-law spectral indices, the\ndistributions would be similarly Gaussian and symmetric for the other relative colors. However, as\nwe have already mentioned, the other colors, including \u2206(g\u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 ), show a distinctive asymmetric\ntail to the red (as highlighted by excess above that of a Gaussian distribution [dotted line] in the\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nlower right hand panel). The objects in this tail are not consistent with an optically steep power-law\ncontinuum. This behavior is characteristic of dust reddening, which gives rise to a curved SED.\nBased upon the above discussion, we group our sample of quasars into color classes based upon\nthe relative g\u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 color. We begin by isolating the quasars in the red tail of the color distribution,\nwhich we presume to be reddened by dust. The definition of such quasars must address the fact that\nalthough power-laws are redshift invariant, dust reddened power-laws are not (at least for typical\ndust extinction curves). Dust-reddened quasars at higher redshift will have redder colors since a\ngiven set of filters will sample shorter rest wavelengths, which are more affected by reddening.14\nTherefore, since we believe dust reddening is largely responsible for this population, we must use\nredshift dependent criteria to select them consistently.\nFigure 3 shows no trend of \u2206(g\u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 ) with redshift. Part of the reason why no trend is\nseen is that reddened quasars with higher redshifts (which sample bluer rest wavelengths) can be\nextincted enough that they drop out of the sample, whereas lower redshift quasars with similarly\nlarge reddenings will not. If we impose a cut in absolute magnitude (Mi\u2217 < \u221225.61) such that the\nleast luminous quasars could be seen at all redshifts in our sample, we do see such a redshift trend.\nThis trend is shown in Figure 6, where the \u2206(g\u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 ) colors of less luminous quasars are shown by\npoints and more luminous quasars by the open squares. The dashed lines show the expected change\nin color as a function of redshift for an SMC-type reddening law (Prevot et al. 1984; Pei 1992) with\nE(B\u2212V ) = 0.04, 0.12, 0.20 (from left to right, and shifted to the red by 0.20 magnitudes; see caption\nand next paragraph). In our volume-limited sample (open squares), quasars at higher redshifts are\nredder, as expected in a dust reddening scenario. There are simply very few low-redshift quasars\nin our sample area which are intrinsically luminous enough to remain in our sample once they are\nextincted by an amount corresponding to a reddening of \u2206(g \u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 ) & 0.5 at z . 1.5.\nAs a result of this redshift dependence, we define a dust reddened quasar to be any quasar\nthat is redder than \u2206(g\u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 ) = 0.2 by the redshift dependent correction for E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.04\n(using the SMC reddening law given above), see Table 1. That is, all our putative dust reddened\nquasars have colors redder than a quasar whose intrinsic power-law continuum slope gives it a\ncolor of \u2206(g\u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 ) = 0.2 and that is also dust reddened by E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.04. Our choice of\nE(B \u2212 V ) = 0.04 is somewhat arbitrary, but it is effective in defining a sample of quasars with color\ndistinct from the general population. In practice, this yields a minimum value of \u2206(g\u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 ) \u223c 0.3\nfor the lowest redshift quasars in our dust reddened sample (see Fig. 6).\nFor the sake of our analysis, we construct a restricted sample of dust reddened quasars by\nimposing an upper limit to how red they can be (see Table 1) since we are most sensitive to redder\nquasars at lower redshifts and we would like our criterion to be consistent as a function of redshift.\nWe exclude objects that are redder than \u2206(g \u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 ) = 0.2 by more than E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.12 (as a\nfunction of redshift) since our completeness drops rapidly for even more heavily reddened quasars.\n14\n\nGrey extinction curves are theoretically possible but have never been conclusively observed.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nThis restriction means that our restricted dust reddened sample excludes the most heavily reddened\nand absorbed quasars. We will also examine a subsample that includes all of these quasars, but\neven this sample will not include quasars of the type discussed in Hall et al. (2002a) since those\nquasars were all identified by eye and not by the automated algorithm on which we have relied for\nour sample. Such quasars are also of significant interest and will be discussed in future papers. Of\nthe 4576 quasars in our sample, 273 (6.0\u00b10.4%) are redder than the E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.04 cut and can\nbe considered to be dust reddened15 ; 211 (4.6\u00b10.3%) also meet the E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.12 upper limit\ncondition that we impose for the sake of uniformity and will constitute our restricted dust reddened\nsample in the following sections. (The uncertainties on the percentages above are statistical only,\nand neglect the effects of systematic errors.)\nOur redshift dependent definition of a dust reddened quasar technically introduces a bias into\nthe sample in that we have defined the cut with the explicit assumption of dust reddening. Clearly\nit would be better to define dust reddened quasars in terms of their rest-frame colors, but we\ncannot do so without interpolating (and extrapolating) our data. It could be argued that our\ndefinition weakens our hypothesis that the sample is indeed dust reddened. For example, the nonLTE accretion disk models of Hubeny et al. (2000) predict quasi-thermal spectra with significant\nintrinsic curvature in the rest-frame UV; such objects could fall within our dust reddened definition.\nIn their model, lower luminosity objects also tend to have greater curvature (their Figure 13). This\ncould explain why the Mi\u2217 \u2265 \u221225.61 objects in our Figure 6 extend to redder colors at z . 1.5\nthan do the Mi\u2217 \u2264 \u221225.61 objects. However, their model does not explain why the Mi\u2217 \u2264 \u221225.61\nobjects extend to redder colors at z & 1.5 than at z . 1.5. Furthermore, we would argue that the\nphotometric properties of the sample (Fig. 3) support our conclusion that the reddest quasars in\nour sample are likely to be dust reddened - independent of our choice of definition.\nOnce we have isolated quasars that are probably dust reddened, it is easy to divide the remainder of the objects into further color classes. Quasars with \u2206(g\u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 ) colors that are not in\nthe red tail of the distribution, \u2206(g\u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 ) & 0.3, are considered to be \"normal\" - their range of\ncolors is consistent with that caused by a distribution of power-law continua. We do not impose a\nredshift dependent criterion to break the normal quasars into color subclasses; we merely subdivide\nthem into color classes along lines of constant \u2206(g\u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 ). See Table 1 and below for the definition\nof the four normal color quasar samples that we will use in our analysis.\n15\n\nIf we restrict our sample to those areas of the sky where the selection limit was i \u2264 19.1 the fraction drops to\n4.5\u00b10.4% (170/3810). Thus the dust reddened fraction among the i > 19.1 quasars is higher than 6%, as might be\nexpected.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n4.\n4.1.\n\nComposite Spectra\n\nComposite Spectra Construction\n\nWe now create composite spectra as a function of relative color (optical continuum slope) to\nstudy the dependence of spectral properties on color in the ensemble average. The composites are\nconstructed in the same fashion as the Vanden Berk et al. (2001) SDSS quasar composite, using\nthe same code. In detail, the quasars are sorted by their cataloged redshifts, shifted to their rest\nframe wavelengths, rebinned to a common wavelength scale, scaled by the overlap of the preceding\naverage spectrum, and weighted by the inverse of the variance. The geometric mean of the spectra\nis used, which preserves input power-law slopes [and E(B \u2212 V ) values, if the extinction curve is the\nsame in all objects].\nFour samples of \"normal\" color quasars are created as a function of color by separating all\nquasars with \u2206(g\u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 ) \u2264 0.3 into quartiles in \u2206(g\u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 ); see Table 1. Each quartile contains 1053\nquasars. Next, we examine the redshift and absolute magnitude distributions of each quartile in\nbins of \u2206Mi = 0.5 and \u2206z = 0.2. We restrict the number of quasars in each redshift-magnitude\nbin to the smallest number in that bin for any of the four quartiles. Each quartile then has\nonly 770 quasars, but now the quartiles have roughly the same redshift and absolute magnitude\ndistribution, which allows us to compare differences between the samples without having to worry\nthat they are caused by redshift or luminosity effects. Table 1 gives the number of quasars in each\nof the subsamples, the \u2206(g\u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 ) color limits, the spectral index of the composite spectra (see\nbelow), and the number and percentage of FIRST-detected radio sources.\nWe create composite spectra for each of these four samples (hereafter \"composites 1-4\"); these\nare shown in blue, cyan, green and magenta in Figure 7. The spectral indices (as measured from\n1450 \u00c5 to 4040 \u00c5) are \u03b1\u03bd = \u22120.25, \u22120.41, \u22120.54, and \u22120.76, respectively. These values are less\nreliable with increasing redness due to the presence of broad absorption line troughs in the reddest\nsamples (see the C IV emission line regions in the upper left-hand panels of Fig. 8 and Fig. 9) and\nany possible curvature induced by dust extinction. That our photometrically defined color samples\nyield composite spectra with power-law continua in the same sense as their input colors testifies to\nthe quality of the SDSS's spectrophotometry.\nWe also create a composite dust reddened quasar spectrum (hereafter \"composite 5\") by combining all 211 spectra that meet the restricted definition given above. The dust reddened spectrum\nis shown in red in Figure 7. A single power-law is a poor fit to this spectrum, as can be seen\nby examining the spectrum at \u03bb \u223c 2200 \u00c5 and \u03bb & 5000 \u00c5. In addition, we present a composite\nspectrum of the 62 quasars that are redder than the upper limit on the dust reddened composite\nthat we imposed above; this composite (hereafter \"composite 6\") is shown in gray in Figure 7. The\nquasars that contribute to the dust reddened composite (composite 5) have a different distribution\nin Mi vs. z space than the quasars in the normal color composites that we defined above: on average, the spectra are 0.55 mag fainter. Thus, we have also created subsamples of the four normal\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nquasar samples and the dust reddened sample such that the four new normal color samples and\nthe new dust reddened sample all have the same distribution in Mi vs. z space; see Table 1. These\nfive new composite spectra (hereafter \"composites 1n-5n\") have 185 quasars each and are similar\nto the original composites, but have lower signal-to-noise, so we have not shown them in full (but\nsee Fig. 9).\n\n4.2.\n\nComposite Spectra Analysis\n\nIn addition to the change in the power-law spectral index with \u2206(g \u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 ), some interesting\nchanges occur to the emission line features. Here we point out some of the more obvious trends\nthat will be important for our later discussion. The major emission line regions of interest are\nshown in Figures 8 and 9. These spectra have been normalized using local continuum windows at\nthe edges of the plots. See Table 2 for the equivalent widths of the major emission lines in the\ncolor composite spectra. Below we comment on each of the panels in these figures. We begin by\nexamining the four normal color composite spectra (composites 1-4; Fig. 8) that are normalized to\nhave the same redshift and absolute magnitude distribution.16\nC IV - There is no clear systematic trend in C IV height or width with color, although the\nredder spectra do seem to have higher peaks and slightly wider profiles. There is, however, a\nclear trend in the existence of BAL-like absorption blueward of the C IV emission line; the reddest\nquasars (composite 4) clearly have more absorption on average, although the absorption feature\nis diluted because of averaging with nonBALQSOs in the composite. There also appears to be a\nslight blueshift of the line (as seen in the red wing of the line) with bluer colors; see also Richards\net al. (2002b).\nHe II - The strength of He II \u03bb1640 \u00c5 grows with increasing redness. The same is true for the\nO III]/Al II/Fe II blend just redward of the He II line.\nC III] - There is a very clear systematic trend of increasing C III] \u03bb1909 \u00c5 height with increasing redness. The nearby Al III \u03bb1857 \u00c5 and Si III] \u03bb1892 \u00c5 lines do not seem to show any\nchange with color. The Fe III\u03bb\u03bb1895,1914,1926 \u00c5 complex also affects this wavelength region, but\nthe profile change cannot be explained entirely by changes in the Fe III strength since the four\ncomposites agree well redward of the C III] peak.\nMg II - Mg II shows a weak, but clear trend towards weaker lines with increasing redness.\nThere is also a slight (\u223c 150 km s\u22121 ), but systematic shift of the line peak to the blue with increasing\nredness. Interestingly, this shift has a color trend that is opposite to that of C IV.\n16\n\nAs we will discuss further in the next section, it is important to realize that any trends among the normal quasar\ncomposites that are seen here will be distorted if quasars that are intrinsically bluer than they appear are pushed\ninto a redder sample by dust reddening.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n[O II] - The two reddest composites have somewhat stronger [O II] 3727 than the two bluest\ncomposites (see Table 2); however, the differences are relatively small.\nH\u03b3 - The H\u03b3 line (which is blended with [O III] \u03bb4363) is somewhat narrower in the reddest\ncomposite spectrum.\nH\u03b2 - A systematic narrowing of the H\u03b2 line is seen with increasing redness. No systematic\ntrend is seen for the [O III] lines.\n3000 \u00c5 bump - There exists a very clear trend towards a weaker 3000 \u00c5 (small blue) bump\nwith increasing redness. This trend is consistent with that seen by Baker & Hunstead (1995) for a\nsample of radio-selected quasars, where both trends were a function of increasing radio core-to-lobe\nflux density ratio R - that is, orientation. This issue is discussed further in the next section.\nUnfortunately, we are not able to investigate H\u03b1 (or the Balmer decrement) since there are\nnot enough quasars in each sample at this wavelength.\nThe above trends are all with respect to the normal color composite spectra. Also of interest\nis how the dust reddened composite spectrum fits into these trends. Figure 9 depicts the absolute\nmagnitude and redshift normalized dust reddened composite (5n) along with composites 1n and\n4n. For these composites, we find the following trends. C IV is quite weak in the dust reddened\nspectrum; both the emission line and the continuum just blueward of the emission line are absorbed.\nThe C III] emission line appears intermediate in strength between the bluest and reddest composites.\nThe Mg II emission line is weaker than the other color composites and shows signs of intrinsic\nabsorption with zabs \u223c zem . [O II] 3727 is much stronger in the dust reddened spectrum than in\nall of the other color composites. Both H\u03b2 and H\u03b3 are noticeably narrower in the dust reddened\ncomposite spectrum. [O III] is considerably stronger in the dust reddened spectrum. The 3000 \u00c5\nbump in the dust reddened spectrum is the weakest of all of the composites, continuing the trend\nof a weaker feature with increased redness.\n\n5.\n5.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nRed vs. Reddened\n\nThe shape of our putative dust reddened composite spectrum reveals something fundamental\nabout its nature. The two primary causes of red continua in the optical were discussed in detail by\nFrancis et al. (2000). In their investigation of a sample of radio-detected quasars they showed that\nif quasars are redder because of the addition of a synchrotron turnover, then we expect them to\nbe redder at red wavelengths than at blue wavelengths (i.e., they will have \"u\" shaped continua).\nOn the other hand, if the quasars are redder at blue wavelengths, then they are reddened by dust\nextinction (i.e., they will have \"n\" shaped continua). Figures 3 and 7 show that our (mostly\nradio-quiet) quasars are are clearly redder at blue wavelengths than at red wavelengths - \"n\"\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nshaped - and we conclude that these red quasars are redder in a way that is consistent with dust\nextinction and inconsistent with synchrotron emission. We have not fully investigated the nature\nof red radio-loud quasars separately since they are few in our sample, but their color distribution\n(see the two dashed histograms in Fig. 3) suggests that dust reddening is at work in radio-detected\nquasars as well as radio-undetected ones.\nWe can then ask how red our dust reddened composite is relative to the normal color composites. Using an SMC-like reddening law with dust local to the quasar, we find that the normal color\ncomposites (1n to 4n) need to be reddened by approximately E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.135, 0.11, 0.10, and 0.07,\nrespectively from blue to red to fit the dust reddened composite spectrum (5n). A composite spectrum that includes all of the quasars in samples 1n, 2n, 3n and 4n requires E(B \u2212 V ) \u2243 0.11 to fit\ncomposite 5n. These results are not surprising given our dust reddened quasar definition, but the\nrelative values are still of interest.\nFigure 10 displays the ratios of composites 1n to 5n; the average of 1n, 2n, 3n, and 4n to 5n;\n4n to 5n; and 1n to 4n, respectively from top to bottom. Overplotted in gray dashed lines are SMC\nreddening curves with E(B \u2212V ) values of 0.135, 0.11, 0.07 and 0.035, respectively. These reddening\nvalues result in good matches to the dust reddened composite (5n) at both 1700 \u00c5 and 4040 \u00c5, but\nthey overpredict the flux between these wavelengths and underpredict the flux shortward of C IV.\nThis discrepancy between these wavelengths is most likely the result of differences in the strength of\nthe Balmer continuum between the composites. If we modeled these Balmer continuum differences,\nthe resulting SMC reddening curves would trace the overall continuum differences much more\nclosely. Similar results are found when using a simple 1/\u03bb reddening law as given by Francis et al.\n(2000). Reddening the normal color composites with the shallower LMC reddening curve produces\nonly marginally better fits to the dust reddened composite spectrum.\nThe issue of the color differences between the normal composites is somewhat more complicated. To help address this question, in the bottom panel of Figure 10, we overplot a curve (dotted\ngray line) showing a difference in spectral index of \u2206\u03b1 = 0.45 on the ratio of the bluest to the\nreddest of the power-law composites. Comparing this curve to the curve produced by pure SMC\nreddening (dashed gray line) suggests that it is likely that dust reddening plays some role in the\ncolor differences between composites 1-4, since the ratio spectrum has slightly more curvature than\nthe spectral index difference curve. Indeed, we will argue in \u00a7 5.3 that the C IV emission line\nshape as a function of color suggests that some intrinsically blue (optically flat) quasars are being\nreddened by dust into the redder (steeper) color bins. At the same time, reddening alone cannot\nbe the cause of the significant trends in emission line properties from composite 1 to composite 4.\nEither the emission lines are responding directly to differences in the ionizing continuum, or both\nthe optical SED and the emission lines are changing as a function of some other property (such as\norientation or accretion rate). As a result, we suggest that the color changes between composites 1\nthrough 4 are dominated by changes in the intrinsic continuum rather than by dust reddening (see\n\u00a7 5.3).\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nFinally, these ratio spectra in Figure 10 also highlight some of the changes in the emission\nline regions that we discussed earlier. One new result from this presentation is that the narrow\ncomponent of H\u03b2 seems to be relatively constant while the broad component is changing (as can\nbe seen by the inflection in the H\u03b2 residual profile).\n\n5.2.\n\nBALQSOs and Reddening\n\nIt has been noted by numerous authors that BALQSOs, especially LoBALs, are redder than\nthe average quasar (Sprayberry & Foltz 1992; ; Yamamoto & Vansevi\u010dius 1999; Becker et al. 2000;\nNajita, Dey, & Brotherton 2000; Brotherton et al. 2001; Hall et al. 2002a; Reichard et al. 2003),\nlikely as a result of extinction by dust. The reddest of our four color composites and the dust\nreddened composite spectrum show considerable absorption blueward of C IV, in agreement with\nthis result.\nAn interesting issue is the BALQSO fraction as a function of optical color; we explore this\nquestion using a well-defined BALQSO catalog (Reichard et al. 2003) from the SDSS Early Data\nRelease (EDR; Stoughton et al. 2002). First, we consider only those quasars that would have been\nselected by the Richards et al. (2002a) algorithm since the EDR quasar sample was not selected\nwith one uniform algorithm. Second, we consider only quasars with 1.7 \u2264 z \u2264 2.2 so that the\nsample is restricted to those quasars for which a BALQSO classification was made using spectra\nof the C IV absorption region. Finally, we divide the quasars into four equal bins of normal color\nquasars (with 434 quasars in each bin) in the same manner as for our primary sample, and we\nalso define an EDR dust reddened sample with 96 quasars. We find that from bluest to reddest\n(optically flattest to steepest), the BALQSO fractions are 3.4 \u00b1 1.5%, 6.3 \u00b1 2.3%, 10.3 \u00b1 2.7%, and\n18.1 \u00b1 3.5%. The BALQSO fraction among EDR dust reddened quasars is is 20.0 \u00b1 8.9%, after\nrestricting the samples such that they have the same absolute magnitude and redshift distributions.\nThus, in agreement with the work cited above, we find that the presence of BAL troughs and\nreddening are highly correlated. It is unclear to us whether the BAL material always reddens the\nintrinsic quasar spectrum, or if reddened quasars are more likely to be BALQSOs, but there is little\ndoubt that BALQSOs are indeed reddened in a manner that is consistent with dust extinction. If\nBALQSOs suffer from dust extinction, then the fractions as a function of color given above are not\nthe intrinsic fractions. That is, BAL troughs may be just as common in intrinsically blue (optically\nflat) quasars as in intrinsically red (optically steep) quasars if dust extinction skews the observed\ndistribution of colors to the red.\nIn this analysis, we also must be careful about how any broad absorption troughs affect the\ncolors of BALQSOs since the C IV trough will often fall within the g band. For the majority\nof BALQSOs the change in color due to reddening in the g-band will dominate over the change\nin color due to an absorption trough in the g-band, as can be seen from the following argument.\nThe standard measure of C IV BAL strength is the \"balnicity\" index, which is sensitive to flux\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\ndecrements of 10% or more over a span of 25, 000 km s\u22121 (from the peak of Si IV to the peak of\nC IV, or roughly 450 \u00c5 at z = 2) (Weymann et al. 1991). On the other hand, a z = 2 quasar\nwith E(B \u2212 V ) of only 0.03 has a flux decrement across the entire g-band of 14% (relative to the\ni-band, and assuming SMC-like intrinsic reddening). Since the g-band has an effective width that\nis more than twice the wavelength range considered when calculating balnicities and since BAL\ntroughs rarely span as much as 25, 000 km s\u22121 (Reichard et al. 2003), the effective absorption due\nto reddening completely dominates that caused by absorption troughs. Our use of relative g\u2217 \u2212 i\u2217\ncolors as a tracer of continuum color thus is valid for the vast majority of BALQSOs, failing only\nfor FeLoBALs and for LoBALs with very extensive absorption (Hall et al. 2002a).\n\n5.3.\n\nEmission Line Trends with Color\n\nMany of the emission line trends with color discussed in \u00a7 4.2 can be related to the principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) of quasars, which has become popular in recent years (Boroson &\nGreen 1992; Sulentic et al. 2002). The basic idea of PCA is to describe the data by orthogonal\neigenvectors and to study the resulting distribution of eigenvalues to learn something about the\nunderlying physics of quasars. Of particular interest are the correlations with the first eigenvector\nas found by Boroson & Green (1992) and summarized by Brotherton & Francis (1999).\nOne of the key emission lines used in eigenvector analysis is [O III] (see Brotherton & Francis\n1999, and references therein). In our sample, little difference is seen in [O II] and [O III] among the\nnormal color composites; however, both of these lines are significantly stronger in the dust reddened\ncomposite. This result suggests that optically steep quasars are not produced exclusively by dust\nreddening, but that the dust reddened spectrum is affected since the increase in line strength is\nlarger at [O II] \u03bb3727 \u00c5 than at [O III] \u03bb5007 \u00c5 - as expected in a simple dust reddening scenario\nwhere dust affects the continuum and broad emission line region (BELR), but not the narrow\nemission line region 17 .\nWe can test the consistency of this scenario by comparing the [O II] and [O III] EWs predicted for a reddened normal quasar with the observed EWs of the dust reddened composite. The\n[O III]\u03bb5007 EW for the dust reddened quasars is 18.97 \u00c5, while the average for normal quasars\n(composites 1n-4n) is 14.15 \u00c5. Assuming the continuum is extincted but the narrow-line region is\nnot, to match this difference requires E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.10 with the SMC extinction curve, in good\nagreement with the extinction required to best match the normal quasar composite to the dust\nreddened composite. However, the [O II]\u03bb3727 EW for dust reddened quasars is 2.81 \u00c5 (after correcting for the 5% weaker Balmer decrement in the dust reddened composite at 3727 \u00c5), while the\naverage for normal quasars is 1.39 \u00c5, and to match this difference requires E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.17.\n17\n\nAn even simpler scenario where the dust affects the narrow line region as well is ruled out because it predicts\nidentical equivalent widths for the narrow lines in all composites.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nThis discrepancy could be explained if dust reddened quasars have stronger [O II] emission than\nnormal quasars. Croom et al. (2002) suggest that a significant portion of the [O II] flux in quasars\narises from the host galaxy. If true, stronger [O II] in dust reddened quasars might be expected,\nas galaxies with significant dust content are also likely to have significant star formation. Another\npossibility is that [O III] emission is less isotropic (or more anisotropic) than that of [O II]. Such\nanisotropy could occur if the higher-ionization [O III]-emitting region extended to small enough\nradii to be partially obscured by the dust which reddens the quasars (e.g., a dusty torus viewed at\nhigh inclination). This latter geometry has been suggested for radio-loud quasars (Hes, Barthel, &\nFosbury 1996) though it may not apply to radio-quiet quasars (Kuraszkiewicz et al. 2000). Note\nthat in this latter case there would have to be a range of reddenings across the sightline(s) to the\ncontinuum source (Hines & Wills 1995) to explain why the continuum appears reddened by only\nE(B \u2212 V ) = 0.1, instead of E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.17.\nBoroson & Green (1992) also noted that there is an anti-correlation between the strengths of\n[O III] and Fe II. If the small blue bump is dominated by Fe II emission, the small blue bump being\nweak in dust reddened quasars when [O III] is strong would be consistent with this anti-correlation.\nHowever, as can be seen in the ratio spectra in Figure 10, the difference between composite 1n\nand the dust reddened composite (5n) has a minimum near 3500 \u2212 3700 \u00c5, rises steadily towards\nthe blue, and rises more rapidly to the red. This behavior is consistent with this color-dependent\ncomponent of the small blue bump being dominated by the Balmer continuum as opposed to Fe II\nand Fe III emission (Wills, Netzer, & Wills 1985).\nAlthough Boroson & Green (1992) argue that their \"Eigenvector 1\" is independent of orientation, it is interesting to examine these results from an orientation perspective by comparing\nour results to the results of investigations of radio-loud quasars. Baker & Hunstead (1995) and\nBaker (1997) argue that radio-loud quasars (RLQs) of increasing lobe dominance are seen through\nincreasing amounts of dust (i.e., RLQs are redder the closer they are to edge-on) and are observed\nto have weaker small blue bumps. The weaker small blue bump, stronger oxygen lines, and greater\nEW increase in [O II] than in [O III] seen in our dust reddened composite could be consistent\nwith their argument (but see Kuraszkiewicz et al. 2000). It has also been suggested that an orientation effect would result if H\u03b2 were emitted from a disk-like structure (Wills & Browne 1986;\nVestergaard, Wilkes, & Barthel 2000) with broader lines coming from quasars seen more edge-on.\nCuriously, however, if the change in the width of the Balmer lines is a function of orientation,\nthen our results - narrower lines in objects which are presumably closer to edge-on (optically\nsteep and dust reddened quasars) - conflict with Wills & Browne (1986). These conflicting results\nmay indicate a real difference between the BELRs of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars. Another\npossible explanation for the change in width of H\u03b2 with color is a correlation with black hole mass\n(Vestergaard 2002); perhaps the bluer (flatter) quasars simply have more massive black holes.\nIn an investigation of the X-ray properties of quasars, Laor et al. (1997) found a correlation\nbetween the width of H\u03b2 and the X-ray spectral index in the sense that narrow H\u03b2 corresponds to\na soft X-ray dominated spectrum and higher L/LEdd (though it is unclear whether the X-ray SED\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nis due to a soft X-ray excess or an intrinsically steep X-ray spectrum). Given our own results, this\nfinding implies that redder quasars may have steeper X-ray spectral indices or larger soft X-ray\nexcesses. Similarly, we have weak evidence that redder quasars are more likely to be radio sources\nthan the bluer quasars (see Table 1). This result is consistent with Richards et al. (2002b) if redder\nquasars also have smaller C IV blueshifts (which will require a larger sample to determine). On the\nother hand, Sulentic et al. (2002) found that it was the radio-quiet quasars that tended to have\nthe narrowest H\u03b2 emission lines and the largest soft X-ray excesses. Clearly more work is needed\nto understand the X-ray and radio properties as a function of color.\nAnother particularly interesting dilemma with regard to the emission lines as a function of color\ninvolves C IV, He II and C III], all of which are popular lines in eigenvector analyses. Richards\net al. (2002b) found that quasars with large C IV blueshifts with respect to Mg II tended to have\nweaker C IV, He II and C III] emission and also tended to be bluer than quasars with small C IV\nblueshifts. Similarly, this paper's color-divided samples also show that the bluest quasars have the\nweakest C IV, He II, and C III] emission. Richards et al. (2002b) argued that the emission line\nproperties of such quasars were most similar to BALQSOs (or vice versa), whereas in our present\nwork, it is the reddest quasars that are most likely to be BALQSOs. This trend with color for\nthese three emission lines does not seem to extend to the dust reddened sample, which contains the\nmost BALQSOs (see \u00a7 5.2). This discrepancy may be reconciled if dust reddened, but intrinsically\nblue quasars contaminate the redder composites, including the dust reddened composite, and if\nBALQSOs are drawn from a bluer parent population (Reichard et al. 2003).\n\n5.4.\n\nThe Fraction of Missing Quasars\n\nWe have not formally addressed the question of what fraction of quasars are missed by normal\noptically-selected samples of quasars because of reddening or because they would be classified as\n\"Type 2\" (narrow line only) quasars (e.g., Norman et al. 2002). Estimates for the fraction of\noptically extincted quasars that are \"missing\" have ranged as high as 80% for radio-quiet quasars,\nbased on the existence of red radio-loud quasars (Webster et al. 1995). In addition, X-ray surveys\nestimate that a significant fraction of AGNs are undetected in the optical if obscured AGNs (particularly Type 2 quasars) are the primary contributors to the X-ray background (Mushotzky et al.\n2000; Brandt et al. 2000).\nOur red quasar sample can be used to reveal something about the population of reddened\nquasars that might be missed by blue-sensitive flux-limited surveys, but that are recovered by\nthe SDSS. A full characterization of the incompleteness of previous UVX quasar surveys to dust\nreddened quasars is beyond the scope of this paper. We merely point out that the SDSS must, by\ndefinition, be more sensitive to dust reddened quasars simply because the SDSS is flux limited in\nthe i-band instead of the B-band and because dust extinction is stronger at bluer wavelengths than\nred. Yet even our sample must be incomplete since despite the SDSS's sensitivity to red quasars\nand its i-band selection, most quasars that are heavily dust reddened [E(B \u2212 V ) & 0.5] will be\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nextincted below the limiting flux of even the SDSS.\nFurthermore, our sample is restricted to those objects that were automatically classified as\nquasars by the SDSS's spectroscopic pipeline. Quasars that have absent, weak, or very narrow\nemission lines; or that are extremely reddened, or show strong intrinsic absorption, such as those\ndescribed by Hall et al. (2002a), are missing from this sample. Examples of extremely reddened\nquasars are rare, but they carry considerable weight since they are intrinsically luminous and are\nthe only representatives in the SDSS of the population of similarly reddened but less luminous\nquasars. Thus, they must also be considered when determining the fraction of missing quasars. A\nfull analysis of this issue is beyond the scope of this paper (and data set), but with the data in\nhand, we can perform some preliminary incompleteness calculations.\nWe can make a rough estimate of the fraction of missing quasars with E(B \u2212 V ) values within\nthe limits of detectability by the SDSS. We take E(B \u2212 V )=0.11 (see \u00a75.1) as representative of the\ndust reddened quasar population relative to normal quasars. At a representative z = 2, observed\ng and i correspond to roughly 1550 \u00c5 and 2500 \u00c5 in the rest frame. An SMC extinction law with\nE(B \u2212 V )=0.11 produces A1550 =1.43 and A2500 =0.81 and thus reddens the observed g\u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 color\nby \u2206(g\u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 ) = 0.62. At a given apparent magnitude, for this representative SDSS-detected dust\nreddened quasar we are sampling the i-band luminosity function 0.8 magnitudes brighter than for\nnormal quasars. In the luminosity range of our quasar sample, the 2dF QSO luminosity function\n(Boyle et al. 2000) shows an increase in the number of quasars of about a factor of 3 per unit\nmagnitude. We must thus correct the number of dust reddened quasars18 with \u2206(g \u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 ) = 0.6\nby a factor of 2.5, \u2206(g\u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 ) = 1.2 by a factor of 6.25, and so on. There are only 9 dust reddened\nquasars with \u2206(g\u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 ) > 0.9 in our sample which require this factor 6.25 correction (Fig. 6); the\nremaining 264 dust reddened quasars will have a factor 2.5 correction. Thus, in addition to the\n273 dust reddened quasars detected in our SDSS sample, constituting 6% of that sample (4.5%\nif we restrict the sample to i\u2217 < 19.1), we estimate that there are a further 443 (a further 10%)\nwhich would have been included in our SDSS sample if they had not been reddened. This fraction,\nhowever, assumes that our quasars have magnitudes near our flux limit and therefore somewhat\noverestimates the actual fraction of dust reddened quasars that the SDSS might miss. Nevertheless,\nthis estimate, while crude, illustrates the importance of accounting for the reddening of such quasars\nwhen studying the full extent of the quasar population.\nWe can also make more general conclusions about the total AGN population. Specifically,\nthe distribution of colors in our optical data suggests that the hidden X-ray population cannot be\ndue to a continuous distribution of dust reddened, but otherwise normal Type 1 quasars. If the\nfraction of missing dust reddened Type 1 quasars were near 50%, the \u2206(r \u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 ) and \u2206(i\u2217 \u2212 z \u2217 )\ncolor distributions shown in Figure 3 would be skewed to the red. Thus, if the X-ray background is\ndue to obscured AGN, there would either have to be a class of broad-lined quasars whose reddening\n18\n\nIn this analysis, we do not impose the upper limit to the redness of the dust reddened quasars that we imposed\nwhen making the composite spectrum.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\ndistribution is disjoint from the distribution that we observe, or the quasars would have to have\ntheir broad-line region obscured and thus would be classified as Type 2 quasars (as is generally\nsuspected)19 . In fact, another way of viewing the problem is described by Ivezi\u0107 et al. (2002)\nwho used FIRST-SDSS matches to show that the SDSS quasar survey is at least 89% complete to\nbroad-lined AGN.\n\n6.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have presented a homogeneously selected sample of 4576 SDSS quasars with 0.3 \u2264 z \u2264 2.2\nand i\u2217 < 19.9. The majority of these quasars are well-fit by a power-law continuum with spectral\nindices ranging from \u03b1\u03bd = \u22120.25 to \u03b1\u03bd = \u22120.76 (optically flat to optically steep). There is also\na population of quasars that are red in comparison with even the reddest power-law continuum\n(optically steep) quasars and that are probably dust reddened. This population is \u2243 6.0% of the\nsample, a large fraction of which are likely to be missed by blue-sensitive optical surveys for quasars.\nA rough correction for incompleteness due to the extinction in this population suggests that the\ntrue fraction of dust reddened red quasars to which the SDSS quasar survey would otherwise be\nsensitive is \u2243 15%.\nAmong the power-law continuum quasars, optically steep quasars are observed to have stronger\nemission at C IV, C III], and He II. The strength of the 3000 \u00c5 bump is weaker in optically steep\nquasars than in optically flat quasars. This change in strength appears to be dominated by weakening of Balmer emission rather than iron emission. In addition to weaker Balmer continuum, redder\nquasars (including the dust reddened ones) have narrower Balmer lines. For the dust reddened\nquasar sample, we also find that [O II] and [O III] emission have very large equivalent widths.\nWe also find that BALQSOs appear to be more common among red quasars than among blue\nquasars and that this color distribution cannot be caused by the absorption troughs themselves.\nThe BALQSO fraction is as high as 20% among the dust reddened quasars and as low as 3.4% in\noptically flat quasars. However, these fractions fail to account for the possibility that BALQSOs\nmay be systematically reddened by dust and may have an intrinsically bluer parent population.\nFurther work on both the color distribution of quasars and the population of dust reddened\nquasars will benefit considerably from the availability of much larger samples of SDSS quasars in the\nnear future, and from the extension of our technique to somewhat higher redshifts. In particular,\nwe will be able to study the very reddest quasars found by the SDSS, which are much redder\nthan those considered herein. We will also be better able to explore the questions of whether the\nreddening is always due to dust, how often the dust is intervening rather than intrinsic, and what\nthe form of the average reddening law is in both cases.\n19\n\nFor a different conclusion, from a much smaller sample, see White et al.

In both panels, contours are drawn at 10, 25,\n50, 75 and 90% completeness, with the 90% completeness contour shown as a dashed line. The\nshaded region is where there are no objects in the simulations; quasars more luminous than the\nmost luminous of our simulated quasars are clearly even more likely to be detected.\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\n\nFig. 2.- Colors of all 5803 SDSS quasars in our initial sample (grey points).

The dashed black line in the upper left hand panel is\nat u\u2217 \u2212 g\u2217 = 0.6, which might be used as a dividing line between \"red\" and normal quasars. Note\nhow the use of such a criterion produces a heterogeneous sample as a result of color changes as a\nfunction of redshift produced by emission and absorption features. A quasar with u\u2217 \u2212 g \u2217 = 0.6 can\nbe perfectly normal (if somewhat optically steep) at z = 0.6, dust reddened at z = 1.2., or appear\nred because of Ly\u03b1 forest absorption at z & 3.\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Relative colors of the 4576 quasars with 0.3 \u2264 z \u2264 2.2, i\u2217 < 19.9, and Mi\u2217 < \u221223.0. The\ngrey points are a scatter plot of the relative colors (x-axes) versus the redshift (left hand y-axes).\nThe black histogram is a histogram of the number of quasars as a function of relative color; the\nnumber in each bin is given by the right-hand y-axes.

The dotted line in the lower right hand panel shows\na Gaussian color distribution as fit to the peak and blue wing; note the clear excess of quasars to\nthe red. The top of the \u2206(g\u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 ) panel shows the progression of optically-flat to optically-steep\nto dust reddened in our adopted nomenclature.\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- Left: Histogram of photometric spectral indices computed from the relative magnitudes\nof each quasar (solid line).
