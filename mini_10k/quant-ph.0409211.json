More\nspecifically, quantum entanglement is now acknowledged\nas a physical resource, which is needed to perform new\nquantum information processing tasks, such as quantum\nteleportation, dense coding, quantum cryptography or\nquantum computation [3]. To perform these protocols,\nquantum continuous variables [4] have recently emerged\nas a relevant alternative to discrete-levels systems. This\nis particularly true in the optical domain, where entanglement of quantum continuous variables provides a tool of\nmajor importance for developing new quantum communication devices, based on homodyne detection of intense\nbeams, rather than photon-counting detectors.\nIn order to characterize simply quantum communication protocols, it is very convenient to consider them as\nthe exchange of some symbols, which carry the relevant\ninformation and can be accessed individually. Hence, an\nimportant issue for quantum communication is to develop\ncommunication schemes operating in a pulsed regime,\nthat are able to manipulate individually each quantum\nstate involved in the exchange. The analysis of such protocols is then very easy in terms of information transfers\n[5, 6]. However, since the landmark experiment by Ou\net al. [7, 8], most of the experiments relying on entangled quantum continuous variables have been performed\nby using continuous wave (rather than pulsed) entangled light beams [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18].\nIn addition, the characterization of the quantum correlations was performed in the spectral domain (i.e. by\nusing radio-frequency spectrum analysers), rather than\nin the time domain. As a consequence, even if they are\nactually pulsed [19, 20], such experiments cannot be easily used to implement quantum communication protocols, because they do not provide access to each individual entangled pulse. These difficulties might be solved\nby developing a quantum theory of analog modulation,\nevaluating the information transfer by defining appropriate time-bandwidth limited modes, and quantizing them.\nBut as long as no such theory has been proposed, ad-\n\ndressing well-separated \"symbols\" \u2013 each associated to\none quantum state \u2013 clearly appears to be much easier,\nboth from a practical and a fundamental point of view.\n\nIn this article, we present a new scheme for the generation of quadrature-entangled light pulses, which can be\nindividually accessed and characterized. This experiment\nis based on the non-degenerate parametric amplification\nof ultrafast (150 fs) pulses through a single pass in a thin\npotassium niobate (KNbO3 ) crystal. Thanks to the high\npeak power of the femtosecond pulses and the high nonlinear coefficient of the KNbO3 crystal, significant quantum correlations (equivalent to about 2.5 dB squeezing)\nhave been reached. The non-separability of the entangled\npulses is then directly characterized by a time-resolved\nhomodyne detection, which samples the quantum properties of each individual incoming pulse.\n\nRecently, our team has developped a similar setup\nwhich operated in a degenerate configuration to produce pulsed squeezed states [21]. The experiment described here presents some further developments of this\nscheme towards pulsed quadrature entanglement. As said\nabove, all our setup operates in the pulsed regime, from\nthe source of entanglement to the time-resolved detection, so our analysis is completely carried out in the\ntime domain, and not in the frequency domain. Since\nthe quadrature-entangled pulses are efficiently and easily generated through a single pass in a nonlinear crystal using non-degenerate parametric optical amplification\n(NOPA), the setup provides a simple and compact source\nfor pulsed quadrature entanglement.\n\nThis paper is organized as follows : first, we review\nsome general results concerning the manipulation and\nthe characterization of quadrature-entanglement (section\nII). Then the experimental setup is described in details\n(section III) before presenting the results of our pulsed\nhomodyne measurements (section IV).\n\n\f2\nII. QUADRATURE ENTANGLEMENT :\nPRINCIPLES AND CHARACTERIZATION\nA.\n\nProducing entanglement : the non-degenerate\nparametric amplifier\n\nA well-known way to generate a two-mode state whose\nquadrature components are entangled is to use an optical\nparametric amplifier in a non-degenerate configuration\n[22, 23]. Let us denote by (X, P ) the quadrature components of one mode of the light field. These quantum\noperators follow the commutation relation [X, P ] = 2iN0\nand thus the Heisenberg uncertainty \u22062 X \u22062 P \u2265 N0 2 ,\nwhere \u22062 (.) denotes the variance of the observable (N0\nis a scaling constant, which equals to the standard shot\nnoise variance). The quadrature components (XA , PA )\nand (XB , PB ) of the output modes (\"signal\" and \"idler\")\nof a perfect non-degenerate parametric amplifier are\ngiven by [22, 23] :\nXA\nPA\nXB\nPB\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\ncosh r XA,in + sinh r XB,in\ncosh r PA,in \u2212 sinh r PB,in\ncosh r XB,in + sinh r XA,in\ncosh r PB,in \u2212 sinh r PA,in\n\n(1)\n\nC.\n\nwhere (XA,in , PA,in ) and (XB,in , PB,in ) stand for the input modes and r is the squeezing factor, which depends\non the strength of the nonlinear interaction. In the following, we will consider the case where the input modes\nare in the vacuum state. The state generated by NOPA is\nthen generally called two-mode squeezed state, as it bears\nsome quantum correlations between the quadratures :\nhXA XB i = \u2212hPA PB i = sinh 2r N0\nh(XA \u2212 XB )2 i = h(PA + PB )2 i = 2 e\u22122r N0\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nIn the case of infinite nonlinear effects, r \u2192 \u221e, the quantum correlations between the quadratures would become\nperfect (e.g. h(XA \u2212 XB )2 i \u2192 0). This case corresponds to the famous Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen 1935\nGedankenexperiment [1].\n\nB.\n\nCharacterizing entanglement : the\nnon-separability criterion\n\n\u0003\n1\u0002 2\n\u2206 (XA \u2212 XB ) + \u22062 (PA + PB ) < 2 N0\n2\n\nQuantifying entanglement : the entropy of\nformation\n\nFor a bipartite pure state, the amount of entanglement\nis uniquely defined by the Von Neumann entropy of one\nof the sub-state [28]. However, for a mixed state, the definition of the quantity of entanglement is not unique, and\nhas led to different theoretical proposals. Among them,\nlet us pay some attention to the entropy of formation, introduced by Wooters in [29]. This quantity represents the\nnumber of qubit pairs necessary to prepare the observed\ncorrelations. An interesting point of this quantity is that\nit has been explicitly calculated in the case of Gaussian\nstates by Giedke and coworkers [30]. For a symmetric\ntwo-mode Gaussian state whose covariance matrix reads\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nV\n0 Kx 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nV\n0 \u2212Kp \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n(5)\n\u03b3=\uf8ec\nV\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed Kx 0\n0\n\nFor a given state composed of two modes A and B, a\nrelevant question is to determine whether this state carries some entanglement or not. For quantum continuous\nvariables, Duan et al [24] and Simon [25] have independently formulated a sufficient condition for a state to be\nnon-separable :\nIDS =\n\nout to be a necessary and sufficient condition of nonseparability. Another criterion used to quantify the quantum correlations between the entangled modes is the\n\"Reid-EPR\" criterion [22], which applies to the products\nof the conditional variances : VXB |XA VPB |PA < N0 2 . It\nis also known that quantum states that are non-classical\naccording to the Reid-EPR condition given above will\nautomatically be non-separable according to the DuanSimon condition (4), though the reverse is not true.\nThus, in the present work, we will use the Duan-Simon\ncriterion as the condition for non-separability.\nIn the case of the state generated by perfect NOPA, one\ngets IDS = 2 e\u22122r N0 . Thus the violation of the DuanSimon condition for separability occurs as soon as r > 0\nand increases with the strength r of the nonlinear interaction. This suggests to use IDS to quantify the entanglement. However, a relevant measure of entanglement\nhas to satisfy some constraints given in [27, 28]. Unfortunately, IDS does not fulfil these constraints and thus does\nnot provide a \"true\" measure of entanglement. Nevertheless, IDS is a direct witness of non-separability and can\nbe used to compute a relevant measure of entanglement\nfor Gaussian states, as we will see now.\n\n(4)\n\nDealing with a symmetrical Gaussian two-mode state,\nsuch as the one generated by NOPA, this condition turns\n\n\u2212Kp\n\n0\n\nV\n\nthe entropy of formation is then given by the formula :\n\u0012q\n\u0013\nEF = f\n(V \u2212 Kx )(V \u2212 Kp )\n(6)\nwith f (x) = c+ (x) log2 c+ (x) \u2212 c\u2212 (x) log2 c\u2212 (x) and\nc\u00b1 (x) = [x\u22121/2 \u00b1 x1/2 ]2 /4. Consequently, for a state\ngenerated by NOPA, the entropy of formation is directly\nlinked to the Duan-Simon quantity IDS as noticed in [18] :\n\u0012\n\u0013\nIDS\nEF = f\n(7)\n2 N0\n\n\f3\nPhase \u03b8\n\nXB,in\nPB,in\n\nNOPA\nXA,in\nPA,in\n\nXP-\n\nXA\nPA\nR=50%\n\nXB\nPB\n\nX+\nP+\n\n\u03bb\n\nFIG. 1: Simplified scheme of the experimental setup used\nto characterize the quadrature entanglement produced during\nsingle-pass non-degenerate parametric amplification (NOPA).\nThe beam (X+ , P+ ) is then measured by a time-resolved homodyne detection.\n\nD.\n\nSimple experimental measurements of\nquadrature entanglement\n\nThe method experimentally developed here to characterize the Gaussian quadrature-entangled states is largely\ninspired from these theoretical results and aims at directly measuring the Duan-Simon quantity IDS . The\nprinciple of our scheme is depicted on Fig. 1. The two entangled modes generated by NOPA are mixed on a beamsplitter of R = 50% reflectivity, while one output mode\nof the beamsplitter is sent to a time-resolved homodyne\ndetection for pulse-sensitive quadrature measurements.\nLet \u03b8 denote the relative phase between the entangled\npulses. When the two entangled modes A,B are mixed\nin phase on the beamsplitter, \u03b8 = 0, the output mode of\nthe beamsplitter (X+ , P+ ) reads :\n1\ner\nX+ = \u221a (XA + XB ) = \u221a (XA,in + XB,in ) (8)\n2\n2\ne\u2212r\n1\nP+ = \u221a (PA + PB ) = \u221a (PA,in + PB,in )\n2\n2\nThus the state at the output of the beamplitter is\na squeezed state, and the corresponding variances in\nquadratures are either above or below the shot noise\nlevel : \u22062 X+ = e2r N0 , \u22062 P+ = e\u22122r N0 . Measuring\n\u22062 P+ = \u22062 (PA + PB )/2 with the homodyne detection\ngives directly one term to be used in the Duan-Simon\nquantity IDS (4).\nIf a relative phase of \u03b8 = \u03c0 is set between the two entangled modes A,B, the output mode of the beamsplitter\n(X+ , P+ ) then reads :\ne\u2212r\n1\nX+ = \u221a (XA \u2212 XB ) = \u221a (XA,in \u2212 XB,in ) (9)\n2\n2\ner\n1\nP+ = \u221a (PA \u2212 PB ) = \u221a (PA,in \u2212 PB,in )\n2\n2\nThis is still a squeezed state, but the squeezed quadrature has now turned to the X quadrature. Measuring\n\u22062 X+ = \u22062 (XA \u2212 XB )/2 with the homodyne detection, one gets directly the other term of the Duan-Simon\nquantity IDS .

SHG second harmonic generation; NOPA non-degenerate parametric amplification; PZT\npiezoelectric transducer; PBS polarizing beamsplitter.\n\na beamsplitter and controlling the relative phase \u03b8 between them and between the local oscillator used in the\nhomodyne detection, one can measure all the relevant parameters to express the Duan-Simon quantity IDS . More\ngenerally, one can easily show that for any phase \u03b8 the\nquadrature sin( 2\u03b8 ) X+ + cos( 2\u03b8 ) P+ is squeezed while the\nquadrature cos( \u03b82 ) X+ \u2212 sin( 2\u03b8 ) P+ is anti-squeezed. Thus\ndephasing the EPR beams by \u03b8 before the recombination makes the phase-space uncertainty ellipse turn by\nan angle of \u03b8/2, but it keeps the ellipticity constant.\nOne interesting feature of this characterization method\nis that it provides simply the necessary quantity IDS to\ncheck for the non-separability from Eq.(4) and to quantify the entanglement from Eq.(7). Only one homodyne\ndetection setup is needed, which greatly simplifies the\nexperiment. This method appears also quite similar to\nthe setups used for dense coding experiments [10, 31, 32].\nLet us now turn to the physical implementation of these\nprinciples in the pulsed regime.\n\nIII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL SET-UP\n\nWe have recently developed a new scheme for pulsed\nsqueezed light generation [21]. This experiment is based\non the degenerate parametric amplification of femtosecond pulses. Here we extend this experiment and pass to\nthe non-degenerate regime of parametric amplification.\nThe experimental scheme is presented on Fig. 2.\nThe initial pulses are obtained from a cavity-dumped\ntitanium-sapphire laser (Tiger-CD, Time-Bandwidth\nProducts), delivering nearly Fourier-transform limited\npulses at 846 nm, with a duration of 150 fs, an energy of 40 nJ, and a pulse repetition rate of 780 kHz.\nThese pulses are frequency doubled in a single pass\nthrough a thin (100 \u03bcm) crystal of potassium niobate\n(KNbO3 ). This crystal is set inside a small vacuum\nchamber and peltier-cooled down to about \u221214\u25e6 C to\nobtain non-critical (90 degrees) type-I phase-matching\nfor second harmonic generation (SHG) at 846 nm. The\n\n\f4\nchoice for a thin crystal length allows for a wide phasematching bandwidth and avoids the conditions of large\ngroup-velocity mismatch, contrary to the previously reported use of thick KNbO3 crystals [33, 34]. Even for\nthe short interaction length used here, KNbO3 proved\nto be suitable to our applications thanks to its high\nnon linear coefficient (about 12 pm/V) and non-critical\nphase-matching. Typically, the SHG efficiency obtained\nis about 28% (corrected from losses).\nA small fraction (1%) of the fundamental beam is\ntaken out to serve as a probe to study classical parametric amplification occurring in a similar KNbO3 crystal used in a single-pass type-I spectrally degenerate but\nspatially non-degenerate configuration. This spatial nondegeneracy is obtained by shifting horizontally the probe\nbeam before focussing inside the crystal. Thanks to the\nfocussing lens, this shift is transformed into an angular difference between the propagation directions of the\npump and the probe beam within the crystal (see Fig. 2).\nFor small angular differences of about 3\u25e6 within the crystal, the phase-matching condition can still be fulfilled by\nlowering the temperature of the crystal by a few degrees.\nThe average power of the probe beam after the nonlinear\ninteraction is directly measured by a standard Silicium\nphotodiode, which allows to estimate for the parametric\ngain. For a well-chosen angular shift so that the probe\nand the pump wave vectors do not overlap, the parametric gain does not depend of the relative phase between\nthe pump and the probe beam. This condition indicates\nthat the non-degenerate configuration is strictly reached\nother the whole spatial extend of the beams. We have\nexperimentally optimised the overlap between the pump\nand the probe beam to maximise the amplification gain.\nFor the\u221abest configuration, the probe waist was set to be\nabout 2 times smaller than the pump waist inside the\ncrystal. Then, the best amplification obtained was 1.24 .\nThis gain was checked to be independent of the probe\nphase and average power.\nThe two beams (\"signal\" and \"idler\") resulting from\nthe classical parametric amplification of the probe are\nmixed on a beamsplitter of R = 50% reflectivity, in order\nto implement the entanglement characterization method\ndescribed in section II D. One output mode of the beamsplitter is then sent to the balanced homodyne detection,\nand interferes with the local oscillator beam (LO). The\nhomodyne detection is set to be directly sensitive to the\nincoming pulse distribution in the time domain. For each\npulse, the fast acquisition board (National Instruments\nPCI-6111E) samples one value of the signal quadrature\nin phase with the local oscillator [6, 35, 36]. The data\npresented below are obtained directly from these individual pulse measurements. Pulsed homodyning is technically more challenging than frequency-resolved homodyning because low-frequency noises cannot be filtered\nout. Each arm of the detection has to be carefully balanced (with a typical rejection better than 10\u22124 ) even\nfor ultra-low frequency noises. By blocking the squeezed\nbeam, the detection was checked to be shot-noise limited\n\nFIG. 3: Recorded noise pulses while linearly scanning the LO\nphase, when the entangled beams are mixed in phase (\u03b8 = 0)\nat the 50 \u2212 50 beamsplitter. Each dot corresponds to the\nmeasurement of one incoming pulse.\n\nin the time domain, showing a linear dependence between\nLO power and the noise variance up to 2.5 108 photons\nper pulse at a repetition rate of 780 kHz and in the femtosecond regime. The electronic noise was low enough to\nensure a ratio larger than 11 dB between shot noise and\nelectronic noise variances.\n\nIV.\nA.\n\nPULSED HOMODYNE MEASUREMENTS\nCharacterization of the non-separability\ncriterion\n\nThe probe beam being blocked, the amplifier operates\nin a pulsed parametric down-conversion regime to generate a two-mode squeezed state. A first piezo-electric\ntransducer allows to finely control the relative phase \u03b8\nbetween the two entangled pulses before the recombination beamsplitter. A second piezo transducer is also used\nto control the relative phase of the local oscillator, which\ncommands the quadrature component measured by the\nhomodyne detection. Fig. 3 displays the recorded noise\npulses while scanning the local oscillator phase, when the\nquadrature-entangled beams are mixed in phase, \u03b8 = 0.\nFig. 4 presents the corresponding quadrature variance\nwhile scanning the local oscillator phase, when the entangled beams are in phase, \u03b8 = 0 (a), or dephased by\n\u03b8 = \u03c0 (b) at the 50 \u2212 50 beamsplitter. As expected for\nthe squeezed states generated by recombining the entangled pulses, the measured noise variance passes below the\nshot noise level (SNL) for some phase values of the local oscillator. The measured correlation variance (with\nno correction) is 0.70 N0 (-1.55 dB below the shot noise\nlevel SNL), while the corresponding anti-squeezed variance is 1.96 N0 (2.92 dB above SNL).\nTo characterize the entanglement of the two-mode\n\n\f5\n\n(a)\n\n500\n(b)\n\n400\n300\n\nSNL\n\n200\n100\n0\n0.00\n\nNoise Variance (mV^2)\n\nNoise Variance (mV^2)\n\n500\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.10 0.12s\n\nThis experiment was repeated several times for different relative phases \u03b8 between the entangled pulses before the recombination. This allowed us to check the\nsymmetry of the state produced : we measured the\nsame correlation variance for \u03b8 = 0, \u03b8 = \u03c0 and several other phases (within reasonable statistical errors less\nthan 0.01 N0 , see Fig.4). Consequently, we can state that\nthe correlations between the quadratures are equal to\n\u22062 (XA \u2212XB )/2 = \u22062 (PA +PB )/2 = 0.56 N0. The DuanSimon quantity amounts then to IDS = 1.12 N0, which is\nclearly below the threshold for separability (2 N0 ) given\nby Eq. (4). This results attests for the quantum entanglement (non-separability) of the pulsed state generated\nby NOPA. One may also quantify the entanglement available thanks to the entropy of formation given by Eq. (7),\nwhich provides EF = 0.44 ebit.\n\n100\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.10 0.12s\n\nTime (s)\nFIG. 5: Quadrature noise variance (dark curve) of one entangled beam (plotted in a linear scale and computed over blocks\nof 2,500 samples) while linearly scanning the LO phase.

The second light gray curve above the SNL corresponds\nto the reverse situation by blocking the other beam.\n\nB.\n\nstate produced by NOPA, it appears logical to compensate for the homodyne detection efficiency. The procedure to measure this detection efficiency is well established from squeezing experiments [21]. The overall de2\ntection efficiency is given as \u03b7 = \u03b7T \u03b7H\n\u03b7D = 68%, where\nwe have independantly measured the overall transmission \u03b7T = 93%, the mode-matching visibility \u03b7H = 88%\n(obtained from the interference fringes between the local oscillator and a seed beam set for maximum classical\namplification), and the detectors efficiency (Hamamatsu\nS3883) \u03b7D = 94.5%. Given this evaluation of the homodyne efficiency, one can evaluate the correlation variance\nof the pulses before the homodyne detection, which is\nfound to be 0.56 N0 (-2.52 dB below SNL).\n\nSNL\n200\n\n0\n0.00\n\nTime (s)\nFIG. 4: Quadrature noise variance of the recombined beam\n(X+ , P+ ) (plotted in a linear scale and computed over blocks\nof 2,500 samples) while linearly scanning the LO phase, together with the shot noise level (SNL) and the electronic noise\nlevel. The curve (a) corresponds to the case when the entangled beams are mixed in phase (\u03b8 = 0), while they are\ndephased by \u03b8 = \u03c0 for the curve (b).\n\n300\n\nElec\n\nElec\n0.02\n\n400\n\nCharacterization of the covariance matrix\n\nTheoretically, a general Gaussian state is fully characterized by its mean values of quadratures together with\nits covariance matrix \u03b3, which comprises the second moments of the conjugate quadratures X, P . For a twomode state, the general covariance matrix \u03b3 contains 16\nterms. In our case, the two-mode squeezed state emerging from NOPA is generated and handled in a symmetric\nway. This point was experimentally checked as discussed\nin the previous subsection. Consequently, the covariance\nmatrix for our state may be reduced to the form given\nby Eq. (5), with V N0 = \u22062 XA = \u22062 PA = \u22062 XB =\n\u22062 PB and Kx N0 = Kp N0 = 21 hXA XB + XB XA i =\n\u2212 21 hPA PB + PB PA i. This means that for the optimal\nchoice of quadratures there is no cross-quadrature correlations. Let us also point out that for Gaussian states\nthe covariance matrix can always be reduced to this form\nusing local unitary operations [24].\nBy blocking one entangled beam before the 50 \u2212 50\nbeamsplitter, we have measured the diagonal terms of\nthe covariance matrix (up to the transmission of 50% of\nthe beamsplitter and the homodyne detection efficiency\n\u03b7). Our results using the time-resolved homodyne detection are displayed on Fig. 5. For the two entangled\nbeams, we have measured a variance of 1.17 \u00b1 0.01 N0,\nwhich can be related to V = 1.50 before the 50 \u2212 50\nbeamsplitter (to get this value, we have corrected for the\n50% transmission of the beamsplitter and the homodyne\ndetection efficiency \u03b7 = 68%). The off-diagonal terms\nin the covariance matrix (5) can be evaluated by noticing that thanks to our squeezing measurement \u22062 X+ we\n\n\f6\nget :\n\nV.\n\n1 2\n\u2206 (XA \u2212 XB )\n(10)\n2\n\u0001\n1\n\u22062 XA + \u22062 XB \u2212 hXA XB + XB XA i\n=\n2\n= (V \u2212 Kx ) N0\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\u22062 X+ =\n\nThe values set to zero due to symmetry considerations\nare indicated by parenthesis. A similar procedure has\nalready been followed by Bowen et al [13], but in the case\nof continuous-wave light detected around 3.5 or 6.5 MHz\nusing a spectrum analyser.\n\nAn efficient setup to generate and characterize femtosecond quadrature-entangled pulses is presented, using\na complete time domain analysis. Pulsed quadratureentangled beams are efficiently generated using nondegenerate parametric amplification in a single-pass configuration. This setup leads to correlations equivalent to\nabout 2.5 dB squeezing, that have been recorded using a\ntime-resolved homodyne detection. The non-separability\nof the states has then been characterized using the DuanSimon criterion with IDS = 1.12 N0 (< 2 N0 ), and the\navailable entanglement has been quantified using the entropy of formation to EF = 0.44 ebit. The association\nof this simple and compact source for quadrature entanglement together with the time-resolved homodyne detection provides all the ressources for future quantum\ncommunication protocols using continuous variable entanglement.\n\n[1] A.
