Specifically, we discuss new spectral constraints enabled by Spitzer,\nstudies of the highest-redshift (z\u223c4) radio/X-ray quasar jets, and a new VLBA\ndetection of superluminal motion in the M87 jet associated with a recent dramatic X-ray outburst.

Prospects for future studies\nwith ALMA and low-frequency radio interferometers are briefly described.\n\n1.\n\nShedding New Light on Large-scale Extragalactic Jets\n\nChandra observations have established that X-ray emission is a common feature of radio jets in active galactic nuclei (AGN) on kiloparsec scales. Harris\n& Krawczynski (2006, and the accompanying website2 ) provided an extensive\nrecent review of this topic. Here, we focus on some of the more recent observational results reported subsequent to this review.\n\nFigure 1. Multi-band arcsec-resolution image of the 3C 273 jet and sample\nknot SEDs (from Uchiyama et al. 2006).\n\nMulti-wavelength studies of radio jets have relied on the sub-arcsecond resolution imaging capabilities of Hubble and Chandra; additional spectral constraints are now being obtained with Spitzer. Recent mid-IR detections of the\n3C 273 jet (Uchiyama et al. 2006) and the hotspots in Cygnus A (L. Stawarz\net al., in preparation) have clarified the relationship between the X-ray and\nlower-energy emission.

[right] Plot of\nobserved fx /fr vs. redshift for X-ray jets in quasars (adapted from Cheung 2004, with the addition of the 1745+624 case). Vertical lines connect\ndifferent knots from the same jet. Curves indicate expected fx /fr ratio for\nthe given combinations of B and \u03b4 (for \u03b1=1), which in the IC/CMB model,\nscale as (1+z)4 . The central solid curve approximately separates knots in\ncore-dominated (larger \u03b4) and lobe-dominated (smaller \u03b4) sources.\n\n(\u223c1015 Hz) in the inner jet knots lie essentially on a power-law extrapolation of\nthe X-rays (Fig. 1), providing definition of this high-energy spectral component.\nSince the jet is long known to be optically polarized, an indelible signature of\nsynchrotron radiation, it is reasonable to infer a synchrotron origin for the Xrays also. The significance of this result to the wider applicability of synchrotron\nand inverse Compton (IC off the CMB) models in other X-ray jets is so far not\nclear since this spectral signature has not been defined so clearly in any other extragalactic jet. New Spitzer observations of 10 other powerful X-ray/radio jets\nselected from XJET2 are being obtained (PI: Y. Uchiyama) and optical/UV\npolarization imaging will be useful in this respect.\nOne potentially distinguishing feature between synchrotron and IC/CMB\nmodels is that the latter predicts high-z quasars to have bright X-ray jets because of the strong z-dependence of the CMB energy density. Specifically,\nwe expect an observed monochromatic X-ray to radio flux (f\u03bd \u2261 \u03bdF\u03bd ) ratio,\n2 if IC emission dominates (\u03b4 is the relafx /fr \u2243 ucmb /uB \u2243 10(1 + z)4 \u03b42 /B\u03bcG\ntivistic Doppler factor and \u03b1=1 is assumed), whereas we expect fx /fr \u221d z 0 in\nthe synchrotron case. Two very high-redshift (z\u223c4) jets are currently clearly\ndetected in both X-ray and radio bands (Cheung, Stawarz, & Siemiginowska\n2006, and refs. therein). The observed fx /fr ratio of these jets are systematically larger than in lower-z examples (Fig. 2), as one expects in the IC/CMB\nscenario. Differences in B and jet \u03b4 then accounts for the widely varying fx /fr\nratios in different jets at similar redshifts; this picture makes clear predictions\nfor jets aligned away from our line of sight, i.e., lobe-dominated quasars. Chandra observations of four additional z\u223c4\u20135 quasars with known arcsec-scale radio\njets being obtained in the current cycle will shed further light on this issue.\n\n\fPanchromatic Large-scale Jets\n\n3\n\nFornax A\nVLA 20cm\n\n1/2 deg\n\nFigure 3.\nRadio image of the double-lobed radio galaxy Fornax A (data\nfrom Fomalont et al. 1989) and SEDs of its different components. At a\ndistance of 18.6 Mpc, the 0.5\u25e6 diameter circle corresponds to 162 kpc. The\nlow-frequency radio data were compiled by Isobe et al. (2006; Fig. 5 therein)\nwith additional 23\u201361 GHz data from WMAP (the 94 GHz measurement is\nomitted because of its lower significance). The predicted IC/CMB components assume B=1.5\u03bcG in the lobes to match the detected X-rays.\n\nOne last highlight comes courtesy of the well-known jet in M87. The X-ray\nand optical intensities of the knot HST-1 in the jet (\u223c60 pc projected from the\nnucleus) had been continually increasing since 2000, reaching a maximum in\nearly 2005 (\u00d750 increase; Harris et al. 2006). New VLBA observations were\nobtained when HST-1 became bright enough in the radio and revealed several\nsuperluminal (1.4\u20134c) ejections associated with the onset of activity. The recent\nHESS report of a TeV flare (Aharonian et al. 2006) broadly mimicking the\nVLA/HST/Chandra lightcurves of HST-1 give us unique insight into flares in\nmore distant blazars (C.C. Cheung & D.E. Harris, in preparation). Monitoring\nis being continued and we expect to extend this program into the GLAST era.\n\n2.\n\nCompton X-ray to Gamma-ray Emission in Radio Lobes\n\nSince the CMB is ubiquitous, IC/CMB losses are mandatory in synchrotron\nsources. This emission is most prominent in regions of low magnetic field like\nthe extended lobes of radio galaxies, and many such sources of IC/CMB X-rays\nare now known (e.g., Croston et al. 2005; Kataoka & Stawarz 2005). Perhaps\none of the best examples of IC/CMB X-rays is in the nearby radio galaxy Fornax\nA (Feigelson et al. 1995) which we further discuss as an exemplary example.\nFornax A is a bright nearby radio galaxy and integrated radio measurements\nextend down to \u223c30 MHz (Isobe et al. 2006). It is detected out to \u223c90 GHz by\nWMAP (Fig. 3) with a steep cm-wave spectrum, F\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u22121.5 \u00b1 0.09 (Bennett et\nal. 2003). Ignoring kinematic factors, we can relate the synchrotron to IC/CMB\nspectra by \u03bdsynch [MHz] \u223c 2EIC [keV]B\u03bcG /(1+z), and figure 3 shows the predicted\nIC component for Fornax A. This assumes an average B=1.5\u03bcG in the lobes\nto match the X-ray detections (Feigelson et al. 1995; Isobe et al. 2006). The\nexpectation is that the electrons producing radio emission in the observed \u223c10's100 GHz range will produce a hard X-ray/soft \u03b3-ray emission signal. Sub-mm\nobservations can show the extent of this extrapolation in the GLAST sensitivity\n\n\f4\n\nCheung\n\nrange. Fornax A is quite extended in the sky, so if it is detected by GLAST, the\ncontributions from the two lobes will be separable.\n3.\n\nObservational Prospects\n\nDetailed resolved spectral studies utilizing Chandra, Spitzer, and Hubble, are currently limited mainly to the brightest jets and hotspots. In the future, JWST\nmay detect fainter examples and ALMA will \"catch\" those with spectral cutoffs in the \u223c10's to \u223c1000 GHz range to better define their synchrotron continua. Another course of study enabled by ALMA is to search for the signature\nof \"bulk-Compton\" emission from a relativistic stream of cold particles (i.e.,\n<\u03b3>\u223c1) scattering the CMB. In Uchiyama et al. (2005), our non-detection of\nthis \"bump\" in the mid-IR argues against a pure e+ e\u2212 jet in quasar PKS 0637 if\n\u0393 \u223c10\u201315 as required by an IC/CMB origin for the X-rays. If instead, jets like\nthis are only mildly relativistic (\u0393 \u223c2\u20133), the bulk Compton bump then peaks\nat \u03bd \u223c \u03932 \u03bdcmb \u223c 160\u03932 (1 + z) GHz which is near the ALMA sensitivity range;\nsuch observations can then test emission models.\nThe next generation of low radio frequency interferometers like the Long\nWavelength Array (LWA) will provide radio maps with unprecedented sensitivity\nand resolution at 10's\u2013100's MHz. These observations will measure synchrotron\nemission from the low-energies electrons which are responsible for IC emission\nin the UV/X-ray bands (see Harris 2005 for such applications). In the example\nof Fornax A (\u00a72.), the first prototype antenna tiles of the Mileura Widefield\nArray (MWA) Low-Frequency Demonstrator already show the double-structure\nat \u223c100 MHz (Bowman et al. 2006) that is known at higher-frequencies. We\ncan look forward to detailed maps of the various components of even fainter,\nmore distant radio sources as construction of the arrays progresses. If the emission extends into the cm\u2013mm range in regions of relatively low magnetic field\n(\u223cfew\u03bcG), it will signal IC/CMB emission in the hard X-ray/soft \u03b3-ray bands\nas postulated in the case of Fornax A; some of the brightest examples should be\ndetectable and image-able with GLAST.\nReferences\nAharonian, F., et al.
