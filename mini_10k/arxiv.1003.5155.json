Advancement\nin tools like optical lattices [3] offer us the chance to\nexplore e.g. second-order tunneling [4], quantum phase\ntransitions [5] and non-equilibrium quantum dynamics of\ndriven systems [6].\nThe double well especially serves as a prototype system to study interference and tunneling in great detail.\nFor instance the tunneling dynamics of a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate has been observed to undergo Josephson oscillations [7\u20139] in which the population simply tunnels\nback and forth between the two wells. However when the\ninteraction is raised beyond a critical value the atoms\nremain trapped in one well, a non-linear phenomenon\nknown as self trapping [7, 9, 10].\nOf special interest are systems in lower dimensions which often display unique features. Quasi-onedimensional (1D) Bose gases have been prepared experimentally by freezing the transverse degrees of freedom.\nThere it is possible to tune the interaction strength between the atoms by either using confinement induced resonances [11] or magnetic Feshbach resonances [12]. Thus\none can study the crossover from a weakly interacting\nto a strongly correlated regime. A particularly interesting case is the Tonks-Girardeau gas appearing in 1D in\nthe limit of infinitely repulsive short-ranged interaction\nwhich has been recently observed experimentally [13, 14].\nThis gas of impenetrable boson is isomorphic with that of\nfree fermions via the Bose-Fermi mapping [15] and all the\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress:\naddress:\n\u2021 Electronic address:\n\u00a7 Electronic address:\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nbchatter@PHYSnet.uni-hamburg.de\nibrouzos@PHYSnet.uni-hamburg.de\nzoellner@nbi.dk\nPeter.Schmelcher@PHYSnet.uni-hamburg.de\n\nlocal properties are identical to the free fermion system.\nThe gas still retains the bosonic permutation symmetry\nand so the non-local quantities differ from the fermionic\ncase.\nTheoretically the quantum dynamics in the weakly interacting case has been studied using the Bose-Hubbard\nmodel assuming the validity of a lowest band approximation [16\u201319]. These studies illuminate relevant tunneling\nmechanisms and resonances. However, to capture the\nrich physics present in the stronger interaction regime\nwe need to go beyond the Bose-Hubbard limit. Moreover\nnumerically exact calculations of the quantum dynamics\nfor few bosons through a one-dimensional potential barrier [22] or a bosonic Josephson junction [23] reveal deviations from the results obtained with mean-field calculations as well as establish a difference between the dynamics in attractive and repulsive bosonic systems [24]. The\ncrossover from the uncorrelated to fermionization regime\nhas been investigated for few bosons [25, 26] and reveals a\ntransition from Rabi-oscillations to fragmented pair tunneling via a highly delayed tunneling process analogous\nto the self-trapping for condensates. The quantum dynamics of an asymmetric double-wells while keeping a\nconstant interaction strength has been explored in refs.\n[17, 18, 25, 26].\nIn this investigation we go one step further and envision a new approach to asymmetry by introducing an inhomogeneous, i.e., spatially varying interaction strength.\nThis can be achieved experimentally by employing magnetic field gradients in the vicinity of Feshbach resonances\nor by combining magnetic traps with optically induced\nFeshbach resonances [12, 27]. We will demonstrate how\nspatially varying interaction strengths enrich the tunneling dynamics in the most fundamental case of a doublewell. This has to be seen as a potential ingredient for\nmore complex problems such as quantum transport in\noptical lattices. Specifically we study the crossover from\nthe non-interacting to the fermionization limit for a fixed\ninhomogeneity ratio of interaction and the effect of varying inhomogeneity ratio. An interplay of suppression and\n\n\f2\nresumption of tunneling is observed. For three or more\nparticles, the interaction asymmetry can be tuned to generate various many-particle tunneling resonances. Lastly\nwe examine a tilted double-well and investigate the interplay between the tilt and inhomogeneity to generate\ntunneling resonances.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section II we discuss our model and setup. In Sec. III we briefly describe\nour computational method. Subsequently we present and\ndiscuss the results for tunneling in a symmetric double\nwell for two atoms first (Sec. IV) followed by more atom\nsystems (Sec. V). In Sec. VI we discuss the case of an\nasymmetric double well.\nII.\n\nfashion. This is computationally challenging and can be\nachieved only for few atom system. Our approach is the\nMulti-Configuration Time Dependent Hartree (MCTDH)\nmethod [31, 32] being a wave packet dynamical tool\nknown for its outstanding efficiency in high dimensional\napplications.\nThe principle idea is to solve the time-dependent\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation\ni\u03a8\u0307(t) = H\u03a8(t)\nas an initial value problem by expanding the solution in\nterms of Hartree products \u03a6J \u2261 \u03c6j 1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 \u03c6j N :\n\u03a8(t) =\n\nSETUP AND INTERACTIONS\n\nX\n\nAJ (t)\u03a6J (t).\n\n(2)\n\nJ\n\nOur Hamiltonian (for N particles) is given by (see [30]\nfor details)\n\nH=\n\nN\nX\nX\n1\n[ pi 2 + U (xi )] + g\n\u03b4(xi \u2212 xj )\n2\ni=1\ni<j\n\n(1)\n\nThe double well U (x) = 12 x2 + h\u03b4\u03c9 (x) is modeled as a\nharmonic potential with a central barrier shaped as a\n\u2212x2 /2\u03c92\n\nGaussian \u03b4\u03c9 (x) = e \u221a2\u03c0\u03c9 (of width \u03c9 = 0.5 and height\nh = 8, where dimensionless harmonic-oscillator units are\nemployed throughout).\nFor ultracold atoms only the s-wave scattering is relevant and the effective interaction in 1D can be written as\na contact potential [11] which we sample here by a very\nnarrow Gaussian. We focus on repulsive interaction only.\nThe inhomogeneity of the interaction is modeled as [30]\ng(R) = g0 [1 + \u03b1 tanh( R\nL )],\nwhere 2R = xi + xj and L is the modulation length\nwhich we fix at L = 1.\nFor R \u226b L, g takes the asymptotic values\ng\u00b1 = g0 (1 \u00b1 \u03b1).\nThus the parameter \u03b1 regulates the relative difference in\ninteraction strength between the left and the right well,\n\u2206g \u2261 |g+ \u2212 g\u2212 | = 2g0 \u03b1,\nand the corresponding ratio is given by\ng+\ng\u2212\n\nIII.\n\n=\n\n1+\u03b1\n1\u2212\u03b1 .\n\nCOMPUTATIONAL METHOD\n\nOur goal is to study the bosonic quantum dynamics\nfor weak to strong interactions in a numerically exact\n\nThe unknown single particle functions \u03c6j (j = 1, ..., n,\nwhere n refers to the total number of single particle functions used in the calculation) are in turn represented in\na fixed primitive basis implemented on a grid. The correct bosonic permutation symmetry is obtained by symmetrization of the expansion coefficient AJ . Note that in\nthe above expansion, not only are the coefficients AJ time\ndependent but also the single particle functions \u03c6j . Using the Dirac-Frenkel variational principle, one can derive\nthe equations of motion for both AJ and \u03a6J . Integrating\nthese differential equations of motion gives us the time\nevolution of the system via (2). This has the advantage\nthat the basis \u03a6J (t) is variationally optimal at each time\nt. Thus it can be kept relatively small, rendering the\nprocedure more efficient.\nAlthough MCTDH is designed primarily for time dependent problems, it is also possible to compute stationary states. For this purpose the relaxation method is used\n[33]. The key idea is to propagate a wave function \u03a80 by\nthe non-unitary operator e\u2212H\u03c4 . As \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e, this exponentially damps out any contribution but that stemming\nfrom the true ground state like e\u2212(Em \u2212E0 )\u03c4 . In practice\none relies upon a more sophisticated scheme called the\nimproved relaxation [34, 35] which is much more robust\nespecially for excited states. Here h\u03a8|H|\u03a8i is minimized\nwith respect to both the coefficients AJ and the orbitals\n\u03c6j . The effective eigenvalue problems thus obtained are\nthen solved iteratively by first solving AJ with fixed orbital \u03c6j and then optimizing \u03c6j by propagating them in\nimaginary time over a short period. This cycle is then\nrepeated.\nIV.\n\nTUNNELING DYNAMICS FOR TWO\nBOSON SYSTEM\n\nWe first focus on the tunneling dynamics in a symmetric double-well with two bosons initially (t = 0) prepared in the left well. This is achieved by adding a tilt\nor a linear potential dx to the Hamiltonian hence making the left well energetically favorable. Instantaneously\n\n\f3\n1\n1\n0.5\n0\n\n0.9\n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\ng =0\n0\ng0=0.2\ng0=4.7\ng =150\n\n6000\n\npopulation p\n\nR\n\n0.8\n0.7\n\n0\n\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\ntime t\n\nFigure 1: (color online) Population of the right-hand well over\ntime, pR (t), for different interaction strengths at \u03b1 = 0.2 for\ntwo bosons. Inset: Long time behavior for very low interaction strength g0 = 0.005. Barrier height h = 8 and width\n\u03c9 = 0.5 has been used for all calculations. (all quantities are\nin dimensionless harmonic oscillator units throughout).\n\nthe ground-state is obtained by applying the relaxation\nmethod (imaginary time propagation). For reasonably\nlarge d, this results in achieving a complete population\nimbalance between the wells. With this state as the initial state, the tilt is instantaneously ramped down (d = 0)\nat t = 0 to study the dynamics in a symmetric doublewell. Our aim is to study the impact of the correlations\nbetween the bosons on the tunneling dynamics both with\nrespect to the interaction strength as well as the spatial\ninhomogeneity. We start by fixing the inhomogeneity\nto \u03b1 = 0.2 (with the left well having lower interaction\nthan the right) and analyze how the dynamics varies with\nchanging interaction strength g0 .\nA.\n\nDynamics from the uncorrelated to the\nfermionization limit.\n\nIn the absence of any interaction g0 = 0, the bosons\nundergo Rabi oscillations between the two wells. This\nis characterized by complete tunneling of both bosons\nbetween the two wells with a single frequency and can be\nquantified by the time variation of the population of the\natoms in the right well\nZ \u221e\n\u03c1(x; t)dx\nPR (t) = h\u0398(x)i\u03a8(t) =\n\n(see below). The dynamics consists of a slow tunneling\nenvelope with suppressed amplitude, which is modulated\nby a faster oscillation. For higher values of interaction\nstrength (g0 = 4.7), the tunneling is completely suppressed. What remains is a fast oscillation with a tiny\namplitude.\nHowever, contrary to the naive intuition a reappearance of tunneling occurs for larger values of the coupling\nstrength. We observe a partial restoration of tunneling\nwith PR max = 0.7 for the value g0 = 150, which is close\nto the so called fermionization limit. The dynamics is\ncharacterized by two frequencies - one very close to the\nRabi frequency modulated by a faster oscillation. Ideally\nat the fermionization limit g0 \u2192 \u221e, the system of hardcore bosons maps to a system of free fermions [15] and all\nthe local properties are identical. Hence in this limit we\nwould have complete two-mode single particle tunneling\nanalogous to tunneling of two free fermions.\nBefore we move on to analyze in detail the above observations, let us comment briefly on the differences between the behavior observed in our setup and the case of\na symmetric double-well with homogeneous interaction.\nClearly both for the non- and infinitely interacting limits the inhomogeneity doesn't play a role. For homogeneous interactions and a symmetric trap tunneling is always resonant and complete. However, different strength\nof interaction yield different dynamics like a transition\nfrom pair-tunneling for low interaction strength to a\nself-trapping mechanism for larger interaction strength\nwhich is characterized by extremely long tunneling times\n[16, 20, 21, 25, 26]. In our case though we observe an\nactual suppression of the tunneling amplitude and not so\nmuch a delayed process. In case of an asymmetric-well\nwith homogeneous interaction, the effects in the low interaction regime are equivalent to our set-up: The tilt\nhas the same effect as an interaction asymmetry, namely\nit destroys resonant behavior thereby leading to a suppression of tunneling [17, 18]. Nevertheless, our case is\nfundamentally different and this is evident in the strong\ninteraction regime. Specifically the reemergence of tunneling we observe does not occur in the tilted double-well\nsystem.\n\nB.\n\n0\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the one-body density. Figure 1 shows that\nPR oscillates sinusoidally between 0 and 1. If we introduce a very small interaction g0 = 0.005 (inset) the\nRabi oscillations give way to a beat pattern due to the\nexistence of two very close frequencies. Increasing the\ninteraction strength further (g0 = 0.2), we observe a suppression of tunneling with the maximum population in\nthe right well PR max \u2248 0.2. This is a manifestation of\nthe inhomogeneous interaction which drives the tunneling off-resonance and should be carefully distinguished\nfrom the delayed pair-tunneling and self-trapping for the\nsame g0 -value in the case of homogeneous interactions\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe understanding of the above-described dynamics\nlies in the variation of the few body spectrum as g0 is\nchanged from zero to the fermionizationPlimit (Fig.2(a)).\nConsidering the wavefunction \u03a8(t) = m e\u2212iEm t cm \u03a8m\nwith energy Em corresponding to the stationary state\n\u03a8m , the population imbalance \u03b4(t) \u2261 h\u0398(x)\u2212\u0398(\u2212x)i\u03a8(t)\ncan be computed to be\n\n\u03b4(t) = 4\n\nX\n\nm<n\n\nWm n cos(\u03c9m n t) + 2\n\nX\nm\n\nWm m \u2212 1,\n\n(3)\n\n\f4\n6.5\n\n(a)\n\nEnergy\n\n6\n5.5\n4.6\n4.4\n0\n\n5\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n4.5\n0\n\n50\n100\ncoupling strength g\n\n150\n\n4.70\n4.65 (b)\n4.60\n4.55\n4.50\n4.45\n4.40\n4.35\n0.0\n\nEnergy\n\nEnergy\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\ngo\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n4.70\n4.65 (c)\n4.60\n4.55\n4.50\n4.45\n4.40\n4.35\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\ngo\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nFigure 2: (color online):(a) Two particle energy spectrum as\na function of the interaction strength g0 for \u03b1 = 0.2.

Moreover, even for low energies the two most occupied modes for propagation do\nnot necessarily coincide with the two modes of the B-H\nmodel. In this weak interaction regime, the B-H model is\njust a good approximation to our exact calculation and\nthus we have used it as solely an explanatory tool to analyze the results.\nUsing the B-H Hamiltonian for UL , UR \u226b J, the\nhighest two eigenvalues are approximately UR and UL .\nWhereas in the homogeneous case \u03b1 = 0 these two levels are close to degenerate UL \u2248 UR (Fig.2(b)), here we\nhave a breaking of the parity symmetry since UR > UL\n(Fig.2(c)). This is understandable since two particles localized in the left well have lower energy than two particle in the right well leading to the energy level separation\nseen in Fig.2(c). In terms of the number-state representation in the localized basis |NL (0) , NR (0) i the degenerate\neigenstates for the homogeneous case read\n\u03c61,2 \u2248\n\nwhere Wm n = h\u03a8m |\u0398(x)|\u03a8n icm cn and \u03c9m n = Em \u2212 En .\nThe energy spectrum of both the non-interacting and\nthe fermionization limit can be understood from the single particle energy spectrum of the double well, which is\nin the form of bands each pertaining to a pair of symmetric and antisymmetric orbitals.\nIn the uncorrelated limit (g0 \u2192 0) the low-lying energies of the spectrum are obtained by distributing the\natoms over the symmetric and antisymmetric single particle orbitals in the first band. This leads to N + 1 energy\nlevels, N being the number of bosons. Em = E0 + m\u22060\nwith m = 0, ..., N where \u22060 = \u01eb1 \u2212 \u01eb0 is the energy difference between the two single particle orbitals in the\nfirst band. Thus for g0 = 0 the levels are equidistant (Fig.2(a) inset) and we see Rabi oscillation with\nfrequency \u03c90 1 = \u03c91 2 = \u22060 . As the interaction is increased (g0 = 0.005), this equidistance is slightly broken\n(\u03c90 1 \u2243 \u03c91 2 ) and we get a superposition of two very close\nfrequencies. This results in the formation of the beat\npattern seen in the dynamics for g0 = 0.005.\nTo understand the dynamics in the low interaction\nregime, it is instructive to map our system to a two-site\nBose-Hubbard Hamiltonian [28, 29]\n\u0124 = \u2212J(\u0109\u2020L \u0109R + \u0109\u2020R \u0109L ) +\n\nX Uj\nn\u0302j (n\u0302j \u2212 1)\n2\n\n(4)\n\nj=L,R\n\nwhere J is the tunneling coupling, UL,R is the on-site\nenergy of the left/right well and n\u0302j \u2261 \u0109\u2020j \u0109j .\nBefore proceeding, we note here that there is no direct\nconnection between the time-dependent SPF used within\nour numerical M.C.T.D.H. calculations and the parameters of the Bose-Hubbard (B-H) Hamiltonian. In the\n\n\u221a1 (|0, 2i\n2\n\n\u00b1 |2, 0i)\n\nand consequently the dynamics consists of shuffling the\nprobability between the two states corresponding to a\ncomplete two particle tunneling.\nIn the case of sufficiently strong inhomogeneous interaction, the removal of the degeneracy of the energy levels leads to a decoupling of the eigenstates into localized\nnumber-states\n\u03c61 \u2248 |2, 0i , \u03c62 \u2248 |0, 2i\nThis implies that the initial state \u03c8(t = 0) = |2, 0i is\nvery close to the 1st excited state \u03c61 and thus is effectively a stationary state of the system. This results in\nthe suppression of tunneling for corresponding values of\ng0\nIn the fermionization limit (g0 \u2192 \u221e) the system possesses the same local properties as a system of noninteracting fermions due to the Bose-Fermi mapping [15].\nThus in an ideal case the inhomogeneity doesn't manifest\n(g\u00b1 \u2192 \u221e) and the tunneling dynamics is identical to a\nsystem of free fermions. As an idealization if we consider\nthe initial state as two non-interacting fermions in the\nleft well, then they would occupy the lowest two orbitals\nlocalized in the left well.

As a\nconsequence there remains a finite probability of bosonic\ntunneling between the two wells.\n\nDynamics with varying inhomogeneity\n\nHaving analyzed how the dynamics varies with changing interaction strength at a fixed interaction asymmetry,\nit is worthwhile to study the dependence of the tunneling\ndynamics on the strength of the inhomogeneity. For this\nwe study the effect of different \u03b1 values on the tunneling\ndynamics for a fixed g0 = 0.2.\nIn Fig. 3 we observe that for \u03b1 = 0, we have complete\ntunneling with a two mode dynamics i.e. fast oscillations\n(\u03c90 1 ) which modulate slower tunneling oscillations (\u03c91 2 ).\nWhen \u03b1 is increased to a value of 0.04, the tunneling maximum is reduced to roughly 0.7 while still retaining the\ntwo-mode character. As \u03b1 is further increased to 0.2 the\ntunneling is suppressed as described in Sec. IV B. The\ncharacteristic display of fast and slow oscillations arising due to the time-scale difference of the contributing\nfrequencies is not prominent here and for higher interaction asymmetry (\u03b1 = 0.5) we have effectively single mode\ntunneling with frequency \u03c90 1 .\nThe variation of the maximum population PR max with\nthe inhomogeneity \u03b1 (Fig.3 inset) shows a sharp drop\nwith increasing \u03b1 before effectively reaching a constant\nvalue \u223c 0.12 for \u03b1 \u2265 0.3. The reader should note that\nPR max does not go to zero in the asymptotic limit \u03b1 \u2192 1\nR\nor U\nUL \u2192 \u221e. This is due to the fact that with a finite value of g0 and a finite barrier height the tunneling\n\nD.\n\nStrong interaction inhomogeneity\n\nAn extremely strong inhomogeneity at a high interaction value leads to an interesting higher band tunneling\ndynamics. We can realize such a system by having \u03b1 = 1\nat g0 = 25. This set up effectively makes the bosons\nfermionized in the right-well and almost non-interacting\nin the left. Preparing the initial set-up with both bosons\nin the left well leads to the suppression of tunneling.\nHowever if we prepare the initial state with two boson\nin the right well, then we observe substantial tunneling.\nIn Fig.4 (a) we see that the PR oscillates between 1 and\n0.5 indicating a single boson tunneling with a single dominant frequency.\nIn order to understand the phenomenon we look at the\nenergy spectrum at \u03b1 = 1 (Fig.4 (b)). While the groundstate remains unaffected, what we see is that close to\nthe fermionization regime (g0 = 25), the first excited\nstate decouples from the higher three states which come\ncloser. The main contribution to the first excited state\nis the state |2, 0i and its separation from the other states\ncould be understood from the fact that two boson in the\nleft-well is almost non-interacting and thus energetically\nfar off resonant from two effectively fermionized boson in\nthe right-well |0, 2i.

(b) Three boson energy spectrum at\n\u03b1 = 0.2.\n\nfollowing: (i) The initial configuration of |2, 0i becomes a\nstationary-state resulting in a highly suppressed tunneling, and (ii) the state |0, 2i of the lowest band becomes\nenergetically resonant and couples to the states |11 , 10 i\nand |10 , 11 i in the higher bands (where the superscript\nrefer to the ground (0) or excited (1) orbital of the corresponding well). The latter leads to a tunneling dynamics in the higher band states predominantly between the\n2nd and the 4th excited eigenstates (see Fig. 4 (b)) which\nhave greater overlap with the initial state |0, 2i. These orbitals have mostly contributions from the states |0, 2i and\n|11 , 10 i while the other orbital has minimal overlap with\nthe initial state. As a result we get a single-particle tunneling with one dominant frequency given by the splitting\nof the energy between these two levels. In other words,\nwe effectively have a single boson tunneling between the\nwells in the excited band. Note that this highly correlated single-particle tunneling scenario is attributed to\nthe high inhomogeneity in the strong interaction regime\nsince the combination of these two factors are responsible\nfor turning the pair-tunneling scenario off-resonance.\n\nV.\n\nMULTI-PARTICLE DYNAMICS\n\nHaving analyzed the tunneling dynamics of two atoms\nlet us now focus on the case of three or more atoms to\nsee the general atom number dependence of tunneling in\n\nLike in the two boson case we start with the initial state\nof N = 3 bosons prepared in the left well. As shown in\nFig. 5(a), the main effects are similar to the two-atom\ncase. The dynamics is again governed by frequencies determined by the energy difference of the low lying spectrum. For very small interaction, the nearly equal energy\ndifference gives rise to the beat pattern similar to that\nof two particles. As we increase the interaction strength,\nwe observe suppression of tunneling for g0 = 0.2 followed\nby a partial restoration at g0 = 4.7 and a higher amplitude reemergence close to the fermionization limit at\ng0 = 150. The general mechanism for the suppression is\nthe same as for the two particle case. Now, however, in\nthe symmetric case \u03b1 = 0, the contributing nearly degenerate eigenstates are of the form |N, 0i \u00b1 |0, N i. Consequently we have a complete N particle tunneling with a\nfrequency given by [16] \u03c9 \u223c 2N U/(N \u2212 1)! \u00d7 (2\u22060 /U )N\nwhere U = UL , UR denotes the on-site interaction energy. The tunnel period thus grows exponentially with\nN . When the inhomogeneous interaction is introduced,\nthe states decouple to the localized number-states |N, 0i\nand |0, N i and thus the initial state becomes a stationary one leading to the suppression of tunneling. The\nimportant thing to note is that with increasing N , the\nsuppression of tunneling occurs for much smaller values\nof g0 . For instance at g0 = 0.2 for N = 3 we have almost complete suppression in contrast with N = 2 where\nwe still observed significant tunneling (see Fig.1) for this\nvalue of g0 . This could be understood from the fact that\nthe contribution of the on-site energy on the cat-state\ngoes as \u223c UL,R N (N \u2212 1)/2, while that of the tunneling\nterm is N independent. This fact is responsible for a\nsignificant decoupling of these states at a lower g0 value\nleading to faster suppression of tunneling as N increases.\nAlso unlike that of the two boson case, the spectrum for the three boson case contains crossings between\nthe higher-lying states (see Fig.5(b)) and in the vicinity of these crossings there is a partial reappearance of\ntunneling. This can be seen for instance at g0 = 4.7\nwhere we observe a restoration in the three-particle case\nwhereas for two particles we still observed a significant\nsuppression (see Fig. 1). In this regime the higher\nbands contribute more significantly leading to the convoluted dynamics observed. These higher band contributions leads to further recovery with increasing interaction strength towards the fermionization regime although\neven for g0 = 150 we do not get the exact fermionic dynamics which is characterized by the tunneling of three\nindependent fermions.\n\n\f7\n1\n\n0.7\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n\u03b1 = 0\n\u03b1 = 0.04\n\u03b1 = 0.5\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6\n\n\u03b1\n\n6.9\n\nEnergy\n\nmax\n\nPR\n\nPopulation PR\n\n0.8\n\n7\n\n(a)\n\n0.9\n\n0.6\n0.5\n\n(a)\n\n6.8\n6.7\n6.6\n\n0.4\n\n6.5\n\n0.3\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n0.1\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\n3500\n\n4000\n\nR\n\n1\n0.9\n0.6\n0.3\n0\n0\n\nEnergy\n\nR\n\nPmax\n\n1 (b)\n\n\u03b1 = 0\n\u03b1 = 0.04\n\u03b1 = 0.3333\n\n0.3\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1 = 0.6667\n\n0.6 0.8\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n(b)\n\n6.9\n\ntime t\n\nPopulation p\n\n0.3\n\n7\n\n0\n0\n\n0.8\n\n0.2\ngo\n\n6.8\n6.7\n6.6\n6.5\n\n0.6\n\n0\n\n0.1\ngo\n\n0.4\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\ntime t\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n4\n\nx 10\n\nFigure 6: (color online): Population of the right-well over\ntime, PR (t), at g0 = 0.2 for different \u03b1 values for (a) 3particles and (b) 4-particles.

To observe this, we study\nhow the tunneling dynamics changes with different values\nof \u03b1 for g0 = 0.2 (Fig.6). The value of g0 is chosen such\nthat the inhomogeneity effect manifest but is still in the\ntwo-mode regime. For three atoms we observe (Fig.6(a))\nthat a complete tunneling for \u03b1 = 0 gives way to suppressed tunneling with increasing \u03b1 value. However at\n\u03b1 = 0.5 we observe a reappearance which is in form of a\ntunneling resonance peaked at \u03b1 = 0.5 with PR max \u2248 0.6\ncorresponding to effective two boson tunneling. In the\ncase of N = 4 we see two resonances (fig.6(b)inset ) the larger one centered on \u03b1 = 0.3333 with an amplitude\n0.75 and the smaller one at \u03b1 = 0.6667 with an amplitude\n0.5 resulting in the reappearance of tunneling shown in\nFig.6(b).\nIn order to understand this we have to study the\nspectra and the underlying eigenstates for different \u03b1\n(Fig.7). In the case of N = 3 for no asymmetry \u03b1 = 0,\nthe highest two levels form a doublet (Fig.7(a)) and\nthe corresponding eigenstates are degenerate of the form\n\u221a1 (|3, 0i \u00b1 |0, 3i). As \u03b1 is increased the parity symme2\ntry is broken and the doublets separate and likewise the\neigenstates decouple (Fig.7(b)). The energy eigenvalues\n(in the limit of very high g0 ) are given by UL , UR , 3UL\n\nand 3UR with the corresponding eigenstates |2, 1i, |1, 2i,\n|3, 0i and |0, 3i. However, when UR \u2248 3UL (\u03b1 = 0.5) the\n1st and the 2nd excited eigenstates become near degenerate and form a doublet of the form \u221a12 (|1, 2i \u00b1 |3, 0i)\n(Fig.7(c)). Thus the initial state |3, 0i is no longer a stationary state of the system. As a consequence we get a\nrestoration of tunneling and the dynamics basically involves shuffling atoms between these two number-states.\nIn other words we have tunneling of two particles between the two wells while one particle remains in the left\nwell. This resonant two particle tunneling is what we observe for the \u03b1 = 0.5 case. As \u03b1 is increased further this\ndegeneracy is once again broken and the states decouple leading back to the suppressed tunneling dynamics.\nThis is reminiscent of what happens in the asymmetric\ndouble-well for homogeneous interactions [17].\nIn similar consideration, for the 4-particle case the energy eigenvalues are 3UL , 6UL , (UL + UR ), 3UR and\n6UR . Now if UR \u2192 2UL (\u03b1 = 0.3333) then we have\ntwo degeneracies viz 3UR \u2192 6UL and (UL + UR ) \u2192 3UL\ncorresponding to the eigenstates \u221a12 (|4, 0i \u00b1 |1, 3i) and\n\u221a1 (|3, 1i \u00b1 |2, 2i). Since the initial state is |4, 0i only\n2\nthe first degeneracy contributes. Thus the dynamics in\nthis case consists of tunneling of three bosons between\nthe wells while one boson remains in the left well. This\nresults in the tunneling amplitude of 0.75.

The\nabove analysis can be extended generically for N particles where we would have N \u22122 resonances corresponding\nto the degeneracies between the eigenstates.\nCorrelations\n\nIn order to study the exact nature of tunneling dynamics, we need to investigate the correlations between\nthe particles. For this we study the temporal evolution\nof the pair-probability or the probability of finding two\nparticles in the same well defined by\np2 (t) = h\u0398(x1 )\u0398(x2 ) + \u0398(\u2212x1 )\u0398(\u2212x2 )it\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\ntilt d\n\nFigure 8: (color online) Temporal evolution of (a) pairProbability and (b) three particle probability at \u03b1 = 0 and\n\u03b1 = 0.5 for N = 3 and g0 = 0.2 .\n\nC.\n\n0.02\n\n(6)\n\nand the three-particle-probability or the probability of\nfinding all three particles in the same well defined by\np3 (t) = h\u0398(x1 )\u0398(x2 )\u0398(x3 ) + \u0398(\u2212x1 )\u0398(\u2212x2 )\u0398(\u2212x3 )it\n(7)\nIn the case of N = 3, for homogeneous interaction \u03b1 =\n0 at g0 = 0.2 both p2 and p3 oscillate close to unity\n(Fig.8). This implies that all the three particles can be\nfound in the same well or in other words they tunnel\ntogether between the wells. This confirms the analysis of\n\nFigure 9: Variation of (a) tunneling maximum PL max with\ntilt d (b) maximum single particle probability p\u03041 with tilt d\nfor N = 2, g0 = 0.2 and \u03b1 = 0.2.\n\nthe dynamics by the eigenstate analysis in the preceding\nsection as tunneling between |3, 0i and |0, 3i states.\nSimilarly at resonance (\u03b1 = 0.5) we find that p3 oscillates from 0.1 and 1 implying that the system oscillates between a three-particle state to a non-threeparticle state, namely the pair-state |1, 2i which can be\ninferred from the variation of p2 (Fig.8(b)). As a result\nwe have pair tunneling on top of a particle remaining in\nthe left-well. (Ideally in the case of B-H model, p2 should\nbe oscillating between 1 and 0.33 while p3 between 1 and\n0. However in our case the realistic potential and parameter regimes as well as some higher band contributions\nleads to the some deviations from this behavior).\n\nVI.\n\nASYMMETRIC DOUBLE-WELL\n\nThus far we have investigated the dynamics in symmetric double-well with inhomogeneously interacting bosons.\nAn interesting extension is to study the dynamics in an\nasymmetric double-well. This gives us the chance to examine the interplay between the interaction inhomogeneity and the tilt. A special interesting consideration would\nbe to see if the tilt could be tuned to offset the inhomogeneity in the interaction and mimic the dynamics of\nsymmetric interaction case or further if it can generate\nsome new tunneling resonances.\n\n\f9\nA.\n\nGenerating tunneling resonances by a tilt.\n\nIn symmetric wells with homogeneous interaction, the\nlocalized N particle state |N, 0i has the same energy as\nthat of the state |0, N i resulting in a complete N -particle\ntunneling between the wells. With the introduction of\nthe inhomogeneity w.r.t the interaction, this resonance\nis broken and the energy of N particles in the right well\nis higher than that in the left well resulting in the suppression of tunneling as seen before. Now if we incorporate a tilt in the double well such that the left well is\nlifted and right well is pushed down energetically in exactly the right amount to make the localized N particle\nenergy levels resonant then we should expect a reemergence of tunneling.\nTo observe this we prepare the initial state with both\nparticles in the right well \u03c8(0) = |0, 2i and study the\nvariation of the tunneling maximum PL max with a tilt d\n(Fig.9(a)) incorporated into the Hamiltonian as a linear term \u2212dx. We restrict ourselves to the \u03b1 = 0.2\nand g0 = 0.2 case. We observe a sharp resonance at\nd \u2248 0.0065 corresponding to the tilt which exactly balances the localized pair-state energy difference due to inhomogeneous interaction. The result is pair-tunneling\nbetween the two wells as we would have it in a completely\nsymmetric set-up.\nWith higher tilt the tunneling maximum falls off very\nsharply as the pair-state becomes off-resonant again and\nwe get a suppression of tunneling. The next maximum\noccurs when the tilt is large enough to make the localized pair state |0, 2i resonant with the state |1, 1i. This\nresults in a broad tunneling maximum at d \u2248 0.045 corresponding to single-particle tunneling.\nTo confirm our analysis of the tunneling mechanism\nwe look at the variation of maximum single particle\nprobability p\u03041 with tilt (Fig.9(b)), defined as p\u03041 =\nmaxt (1 \u2212 p2 (t)) which gives the probability of having\nonly one particle in a well. We observe a negligible value\nat the first resonance d \u2248 0.0065 confirming that the dynamics is pair-tunneling while a very broad maximum\npeaked at the second resonance d \u2248 0.045 corresponds\nto the maximum probability of finding a single particle\nwhich in our case is the |1, 1i state and the dynamics is\na single particle tunneling between the |0, 2i and |1, 1i\nstates.\n\nB.\n\nSpectral Analysis\n\nTo understand the effect of the tilt on the tunneling\ndynamics we study the energy spectra E with varying\ntilt d at fixed g0 = 0.2 and \u03b1 = 0.2 (Fig.10). At d = 0\nthe eigenstates are basically number-states in the localized basis. With increasing d, the highest two levels |0, 2i\nand |2, 0i move closer and form a sharp avoided crossing\nat d \u2248 0.0065 corresponding to the first tunneling resonance. At this point the tilt exactly balances the interaction inhomogeneity and the eigenstate is in form of\n\nEnergy\n\n4.7\n4.6\n4.5\n4.4\n4.3\n0.00\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\nd\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\nFigure 10: (color online) Two particle energy spectrum with\ntilt d for \u03b1 = 0.2 and g0 = 0.2.\n\nthe cat-state |2, 0i \u00b1 |0, 2i. This state is very sensitive to\nthe tilt and a minute perturbation decouples them into\nthe localized number-state resulting in a very sharp tunneling resonance. The ground-state, which is the |1, 1i\nstate is insensitive to the tilt since this lowering of one\nparticle and raising another particle keeps the state energetically unaffected within the linear regime. This state\nforms a broad (anti)crossing with the lower excitedstate\nat d \u2248 0.045 forming the broad single-particle tunneling resonance seen in the dynamics. This behavior seen\nin the two-particle case can be expected in general for\nN particles giving N resonances corresponding to the\navoided crossings encountered. In particular with increasing tilt, the successive resonances corresponds to a\nmechanism where one less particle tunnels compared to\nthat of the previous one while the width of the resonances\nbecomes progressively broader.\n\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK\n\nWe have investigated the double-well tunneling dynamics with inhomogeneous interaction. More specifically we modeled the system such that we have two different interaction strengths in the two wells. What we\nobserve is that this inhomogeneity leads to a suppression of tunneling. The reason for this suppression can\nbe attributed to the breaking up of the doublet structure in the energy spectrum leading to a decoupling of\nthe eigenstates into the localized number-state. Increasing the interaction to the fermionization limit leads to a\nreappearance of the tunneling. The dynamics is governed\nby the band splitting of the first two bands although the\nfiniteness of the interaction strength and the presence of\nthe interaction inhomogeneity leads to deviation from the\nideal fermionic behavior. For a very pronounced interaction inhomogeneity for strong interactions, we observe\nsingle particle tunneling between the localized excited\nbands of the double-well.\nThese basic considerations can be used to understand\nthe many particle system. There we observed a more\nsevere suppression of tunneling for even lower g0 values.\nMost importantly for N \u2265 3 atoms, one can generate\n\n\f10\ntunneling resonances by tuning the interaction asymmetry. These resonances occur as a result of the formation of degeneracies between different eigenstates. For\nthree particles, the exact tunneling mechanism was investigated using the evolution of the pair-probability and\nthe three-particle probability. These studies show that\nwe get correlated pair and triplet tunneling with a complete absence of single particle tunneling.\nFinally we explored the dynamics in a asymmetric\ndouble-well and this gives us an understanding of the\ninterplay between the interaction inhomogeneity and the\ntilt. We observe that the tilt can be tuned to offset the\ninteraction inhomogeneity leading to a tunneling resonance. These dynamics have been explained through the\nspectral analysis in terms of avoided crossings between\nthe levels. Note that an interesting prospective would\nbe to try to describe the presently found effects in the\ncontext of a generalized Bose-Hubbard model, where the\non-site energies and the coupling constants would be siteand occupation number dependent[36\u201338].\nUnderstanding the few-body mechanisms of tunneling\n\nwith spatially modulated interactions can be used to design schemes for selective transport of particles between\ndifferent wells and/or reservoir systems [39, 40]. Further our study could serve as a starting point for the\ninvestigation of the quantum dynamics in the presence\nof time-dependent interaction modulations and even be\nextended to multi-well systems [41].\n\n[1] L.
