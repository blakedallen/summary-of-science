As a surprising feature\nwe detected a small offset of 0.15\u20130.2 eV in the electrostatic potential across the 90\u25e6 domain wall.\nPACS numbers: 77.80.Dj, 77.84.Dy, 61.72.Mm, 68.35.Ct\n\nthen.4 However, some of the parameters needed in the\nexpansion of the free energy functional can only roughly\nbe estimated from the experimental data available, the\nempirical approaches based on Landau-Ginzburg theory\nare rather limited and tend to be more qualitative in nature. Also, for atomically sharp domain walls the applicability of continuum theoretical models is questionable.\nThus, for a deeper theoretical understanding of domain\nwalls, more accurate atomistic calculations are need.\nA first work in this direction was undertaken by\nPadilla, Zhong, and Vanderbilt5 who investigated 180\u25e6\ndomain walls in tetragonal BaTiO3 using an effective\nHamiltonian derived from first-principles calculations.\nWith this effective Hamiltonian, Monte-Carlo simulations at finite temperatures were performed to calculate\nthe energy, free energy and thickness of the wall. A very\nnarrow domain wall with energy 16 mJ/m2 was found.\nWith a first-principles pseudopotential method based\non density-functional theory, P\u00f6ykk\u00f6 and Chadi6 studied the 180\u25e6 domain wall in PbTiO3 . They confirmed a\npicture in which 180\u25e6 walls are very narrow, but found a\nmuch higher domain-wall energy than for BaTiO3 .\nIn this paper, we undertake a first-principles study of\nthe 180\u25e6 and 90\u25e6 domain walls in PbTiO3 . For both\ndomain wall types we have calculated the fully relaxed\natomic structure, the domain-wall energy, the polarization profile across the domain wall, and an estimate of\nthe barrier height for their motion. As for the 180\u25e6 domain wall, our study is similar in spirit to the work of\nP\u00f6ykk\u00f6 and Chadi, but the conclusions differ in some\nimportant respects. However, the main focus of this paper will be on the 90\u25e6 domain wall, where we are not\naware of any previous first-principles study for a ferroelectric perovskite. The 90\u25e6 domain wall is of particular\ninterest because some detailed experimental results on\nits atomistic structure have recently become available.\n(The experimental investigation of the 180\u25e6 domain wall\nis much more difficult.) Some of the experiments on the\n90\u25e6 domain wall have created considerable doubt regard-\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nAfter cooling below the transition temperature, ferroelectric crystals usually adopt a very complex microstructure consisting of regions with different orientations of\nthe spontaneous polarization. These domains are formed\nto reduce uncompensated depolarization fields at the surface, releasing elastic strain and so lowering the free energy of the crystal. The domain structure and the properties of the domain boundaries play an important role\nin the performance of many ferroelectric devices. Mechanical and electrical characteristics, such as the permittivity, coercive field, and piezoelectric constants, are\noften significantly influenced. In particular, the thickness and the interfacial energy of the domain walls are\nimportant parameters in understanding the switching kinetics and fatigue mechanism in ferroelectric materials.\nThe width affects the wall mobility, and the energy determines how easily new domain walls may be introduced\nduring polarization reversal processes. Thus, for a thorough understanding of the physical processes associated\nwith the switching and fatigue behavior of a ferroelectric material, an accurate microscopic description of the\nunderlying domain walls and their dynamics is required.\nA phenomenological level of description has been used\nin most previous theoretical investigations of ferroelectric\ndomain walls. Several authors have modeled the structure of domain walls by using a Landau-Ginzburg type\nof continuum theory.1\u20133 The domain wall is described by\na soliton solution, giving the polarization profile and the\ndistribution of the elastic strain across the domain wall,\nfrom which the domain wall width and energy can be\ndeduced. For example, in a very early work Zhirnov1\nobtained estimates for the thickness of domain walls in\nBaTiO3 . He found the 180\u25e6 domain wall to be atomically sharp with a width of only 5\u201320 \u00c5, but he predicted\nthe 90\u25e6 domain wall to be much broader with a thickness of 50\u2013100 \u00c5. This different picture of 180\u25e6 and 90\u25e6\ndomain walls has been quite commonly accepted since\n1\n\n\fing the commonly accepted picture that the 90\u25e6 domain\nwall is much broader than its 180\u25e6 counterpart. With the\npresent simultaneous study of the 90\u25e6 and 180\u25e6 domain\nwall, we provide strong support, at least in the case of\ndefect-free walls at low temperature, that both domain\nwalls are of comparable width. However, we find that\nthe barrier for the motion of the 90\u25e6 domain wall is extremely small, suggesting that at non-zero temperatures\nthe domain walls may fluctuate strongly.\nMany experimental techniques are capable of revealing the domain microstructure of a ferroelectric crystal,4\nbut it is much more difficult to image the domain boundaries and determine their structure with atomic-level accuracy. Most studies so far have used high-resolution\ntransmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) to obtain direct images of the domain walls.7\u201311 In a detailed study\nof 90\u25e6 domain walls in BaTiO3 and Pb(Zr0.52 Ti0.48 )O3\nTsai et al.8 observed a diffuse dark contrast about 4\u2013\n10 unit cells wide in their HRTEM images of domain\nboundaries, which they attributed to deviations from the\nBragg condition through lattice distortions and ionic displacements. But no further analysis of these images was\ndone. Combining HRTEM and quantitative image analysis, Stemmer et al.9 measured the width of the 90\u25e6 domain wall in PbTiO3 to be 10\u00b13 \u00c5, and they gave an estimate for the domain-wall energy of 50 mJ/m2 . This evidence for a very narrow 90\u25e6 domain wall in PbTiO3 was\nfurther confirmed by Foeth et al.11 From their HRTEM\nimages they obtained a width of 15\u00b13 \u00c5 at room temperature, and from the analysis of the thickness fringes of\nweak-beam transmission electron microscopy (WBTEM)\nthey found a value of 21\u00b17 \u00c5. In contrast, Floquet et al.11\nconcluded, based on their combined study of HRTEM\nimages and a careful analysis of the X-ray diffraction\npattern (XRPD) of BaTiO3 , that 90\u25e6 domain walls are\nregions of width 40\u201360 \u00c5 where the crystallographic discontinuity is accommodated by irregular atomic displacements. For micron-sized BaTiO3 grains they even proposed a wall thickness of 140 \u00c5.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section II we describe the technical details of our computational method\nand the geometry of the supercells used to model the domain walls. In Section III and IV we present our results\non the 180\u25e6 and 90\u25e6 domain walls, respectively. Finally,\nthe paper concludes with a summary, Section V, in which\nwe also discuss the results in the context of the previous\nexperimental work.\n\na [\u00c5]\nc [\u00c5]\n\nTheory\n3.86\n4.04\n\nExp.a\n3.90\n4.15\n\n\u03bez (Pb)\n\u03bez (Ti)\n\u03bez (OI )\n\u03bez (OII )\n\u03bez (OIII )\n\n0.71\n0.34\n\u22120.39\n\u22120.39\n\u22120.27\n\n0.72\n0.33\n\u22120.35\n\u22120.35\n\u22120.35\n\n|\u03be| [\u00c5]\n\n0.38\n\n0.43\n\nTABLE I.

Also\ndefects22 and surfaces23,24 in ferroelectric materials have\nbeen studied using DFT methods.\nThe pseudopotentials were of the Vanderbilt ultrasoft\ntype25 with the semicore Pb 5d and Ti 3s and 3p states\nexplicitly treated as valence states (in contrast to Ref. 6).\nA conjugate gradient technique as described in Ref. 15\nwas employed to minimize the Hohenberg-Kohn total energy functional. For the plane-wave expansion of the electron wavefunctions a cutoff energy of 25 Ry was used.\nThe same pseudopotentials have already been used in\nseveral previous studies on PbTiO3 where their accuracy\nhas been demonstrated,15,24 and where it has been shown\nthat a cutoff energy of 25 Ry is sufficient to obtain very\nwell converged results. The resulting computed structural parameters for the tetragonal phase of PbTiO3 are\ngiven in Table I. The lattice constants a and c are underestimated by 1 % and 2.6 %, respectively, which is typical for LDA. The deviations in the atomic displacements\nof the oxygen ions between theory and experiment are\nmainly due to the fact that the X\u2013ray data were analyzed under the assumption that the displacement is the\nsame for all three oxygen atoms.\nThe construction of appropriate supercells for the\nstudy of the domain walls of interest will be detailed\nin the following subsection. All atomic configurations\nwere fully relaxed by minimizing the atomic forces using\na variable-metric scheme.27 Convergence was assumed\nwhen the forces on the ions were less than 0.005 eV/\u00c5.\n\nII. THEORETICAL DETAILS\nA. Method of calculation\n\nFor our calculations we have used a first-principles\nplane-wave pseudopotential method based on densityfunctional theory (DFT)12 within the local-density approximation (LDA).13 Ab-initio simulations of this kind\n\n2\n\n\f(a)\n\nB. Domain wall geometries\n\nPbTiO3 belongs to the important group of ferroelectric\nmaterials based on the cubic perovskite structure. At the\ntemperature of 765 K PbTiO3 undergoes a single phase\ntransition from the paraelectric cubic phase to a tetragonally distorted ferroelectric phase, Fig. 1(a), and remains\nin this tetragonal phase down to T = 0. In this state, six\nenergetically equivalent orientations of the spontaneous\npolarization exist. The domain walls between these variants can be regarded as twin boundaries on low-index\nlattice planes. With the additional constraint that the\nnormal component of the polarization should be continuous across the domain wall, so that no net interface\ncharge is present, there are two allowed types: (i) twins\non (100) planes with parallel polarization of opposite orientation in the neighboring domains (180\u25e6 domain wall);\nand (ii) twins on (101) planes with the polarizations on\neither side of the domain wall being almost perpendicular\nto one another (90\u25e6 domain wall). These situations are\nillustrated in Figs. 1(b) and (c), respectively.\nFor 180\u25e6 domain walls, two possible high-symmetry\ncases exist. These are Pb\u2013centered and Ti\u2013centered domain walls, resulting from twinning on PbO\u2013 and TiO2 \u2013\nplanes, respectively. In each case one of the metal cations\nacts as a center of inversion symmetry. Of course, we\nhave to check whether one of these symmetries is actually present, or whether the atomic relaxation leads to a\nlower-symmetry structure; we will return to this point in\nSec. III.\nFor the 90\u25e6 domain wall, we can imagine obtaining\na starting structure by twinning on either Pb\u2013Ti\u2013O or\nO\u2013O types of (101) planes. However, in this case the\n\"flow\" of the polarization establishes an intrinsic difference between the \"upstream\" and \"downstream\" sides\nof the domain wall (left and right sides, respectively, in\nFig. 1(c)). Thus, the two sides of the domain wall cannot be related by any symmetry operation, and there\nis no possible scenario in which the position of the domain wall is determined by symmetry. In other words,\nwe expect that if we start from either starting guess, the\nstructure will relax to some ground-state structure located at some intermediate position between the Pb\u2013Ti\u2013\nO and O\u2013O limits. There is thus no sharp distinction\nbetween a Pb\u2013Ti\u2013O or an O\u2013O centered domain wall in\nthe 90\u25e6 case. In our calculations, we start the relaxation\nfrom the structure obtained by twinning on the Ti\u2013Pb\u2013\nO plane. (As we shall see, the relaxed structure ends up\nbeing centered much closer to the O\u2013O plane, so clearly\nwe introduce no bias by doing so.)\nSince periodic boundary conditions are used in planewave pseudopotential calculations, we cannot study single domain walls in isolation. Instead we have to build\nsupercells containing a domain structure that can be repeated periodically in three dimensions. As a consequence, we always have to include two domain walls in a\nsupercell.\n\nIII\n\nP\nI\n\nI\n\nII\n\nc\n\nIII\n\nPb\n\nTi\n\n(b)\n\na\n\nO\nz\n\nc\nx\na\n\nDW\n\nDW\n\nDW\n\nz\n\n(c)\n\nx\n\nDW\n\nDW\nDW\n\nFIG. 1.

We take the domain wall to lie in the\ny\u2013z plane and the polarization to point in the z\u2013direction.\nSupercells with N = 6, 8 and 10 were employed, containing 30, 40 and 50 atoms, respectively. The dimensions of\nthe supercell were kept fixed at the theoretical equilibrium lattice constants computed for the bulk tetragonal\nphase (see Table I). For all Brillouin-zone integrations\na (2,4,4) Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh28 was used; this\n3\n\n\fk\u2013point mesh has previously been shown to be sufficient\nfor PbTiO3 .24\nThe geometry of the supercell containing two 90\u25e6 domain walls is sketched in Fig. 1(c). The tetragonal shape\nof the PbTiO3 unit cell causes the angle between the c\naxes on either side of the domain wall to deviate slightly\nfrom 90\u25e6 . Instead, to form a coherent twin interface,\nan angle of 2 arctan(a/c) is geometrically required. This\ngives rise to a very characteristic bending of the [100]\nand [001] atomic rows (a\u2013 and c\u2013rows) across the domain wall; in fact, this bending is precisely the signature\nthrough which 90\u25e6 domain walls are identified in HRTEM\nimages.9 Again, we have taken the domain wall to lie in\nthe y\u2013z plane and the x direction to be perpendicular to\nthe wall.\nwith dimensions\np\np The supercell is orthorhombic\nof N c/ 1 + (c/a)2 , a, and a 1 + (c/a)2 in the x\u2013, y\u2013,\nand z\u2013directions, respectively. We used supercells consisting of N = 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 perovskite unit cells,\nthus containing up to 70 atoms. The theoretical LDA\nvalues from Table I were taken for the lattice parameters\na and c. For one supercell we also relaxed the lattice constant in the x direction, but the resulting expansion of the\nsupercell in the x direction was very small (less than 0.8 %\nof a), and the changes in the atomic displacements and in\nthe domain-wall energy were negligible. Two symmetry\noperations were imposed during the atomic relaxation: a\nmirror operation across the y=0 plane, and a glide mirror\noperation across the z=0 plane with a translation of half\nthe superlattice dimension in the x direction. The first\nsymmetry corresponds to a physical assumption that the\npolarization does not rotate out of the y=0 plane, while\nthe second is just a technical convenience to insure that\nboth domains in the supercell stay equivalent.

The domain-wall energy is lowest for the Pb\u2013centered domain wall; this is therefore the\npreferred wall configuration. The same ordering holds for\nBaTiO3 , but the domain-wall energies are significantly\nlower. As can be seen from the Table, the domain-wall\nenergy is well converged even with the smallest separations of the domain walls.\nIn contrast, P\u00f6ykk\u00f6 and Chadi6 found that domains\nhave to be at least four lattice constants wide before\nthe up/down domain pattern becomes stable. Furthermore, their calculations indicated that the Pb\u2013centered\ndomain-wall energy could be lowered by almost a factor\nof two by breaking the inversion symmetry about a Pb\natom in the domain wall. In their lowest-energy structure, in which there are large relaxations of Pb and O positions in the domain-wall plane, the only remaining symmetry was a 180\u25e6 rotation about a z\u2013axis (C2z ) passing\nthrough the center of a domain. In view of those results,\nwe made careful tests in which we lowered the symmetry\nof our supercell in two ways: (i) as in the final result of\nRef. 6, we kept only the C2z symmetry about the center\nof a domain; and (ii) as in the case of the 90\u25e6 domain\nwall, we kept only the glide mirror plane at z=0 with a\nhalf-supercell translation along x. We then distorted the\natomic configuration in several ways compatible with the\nlowered symmetry and started a new atomic relaxation.\nIn all cases, the structure relaxed back toward the highsymmetry centrosymmetric structure. The relaxation is\nvery slow, indicating a very flat energy surface, but we\nnever found a lower-energy structure with reduced symmetry.\nRegarding the domain-wall energy, our value of\n132 mJ/m2 for the Pb\u2013centered wall is much lower than\nthe value of 270 mJ/m2 obtained in Ref. 6 when inversion\nsymmetry is imposed. Strangely, it is much closer to the\n150 mJ/m2 value reported in Ref. 6 when inversion symmetry breaking is allowed. For the Ti\u2013centered domain\nwall our wall energy of 169 mJ/m2 again lies below their\nvalue of 220 mJ/m2 . The case of a Ti\u2013centered wall with\nbroken inversion symmetry cannot be considered, since\nrelaxation of the domain wall would then just transform\nit into a Pb\u2013centered wall, as we will show in Sec. III C.\n\nIII. RESULTS FOR THE 180\u25e6 DOMAIN WALL\n\nWe have investigated both the Pb\u2013 and Ti\u2013centered\ndomain walls. The relaxation of the atomic structure\nwas started from the ideal twinned configurations, and\nthe inversion symmetry centered on a cation in the domain wall was enforced during the structural optimization process. This prevents a Ti\u2013centered domain wall\nfrom transforming into a Pb\u2013centered wall or vice versa.\nA. Domain wall energy\n\nThe results for the domain-wall energies from our various supercells are summarized in Table II. The reference\nenergy of the bulk structure (without domain walls) was\ncalculated from a single perovskite unit cell using a k\u2013\npoint mesh equivalent to the one used for the supercell.\nValues for BaTiO3 are given for comparison; these were\n\n4\n\n\fz\n\n0.54\n\nTiO 2 \u2212plane\nPbO\u2212plane\n\nOII\n\nTi\nz [units of c]\n\n(a)\n\nx\n\nOI\n\n0.52\n0.5\n0.48\n0.46\n\nR z : 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.01 0.80 0.0 0.80 1.01 1.00 1.00 1.00\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n0.10\n\n(b)\n\nz\n\nPb\n\n0.08\n\nPbO\u2212plane\nTiO 2 \u2212plane\n\ndomain wall\nposition\n\n0.06\n\nz [units of c]\n\n0.04\n\nx\nR z : 1.00 1.00 1.01 0.96 0.69 0.0 0.69 0.96 1.01 1.00 1.00\n\n0.02\n0.00\n\nOIII\n\n\u22120.02\n\u22120.04\n\n6 unit cells\n8 unit cells\n10 unit cells\n\n\u22120.06\n\nFIG. 2.\nChange of polarization across the (a)\nPb\u2013centered, and (b) Ti\u2013centered, 180\u25e6 domain wall.

Integer distances represent PbO planes, half-integer\ndistances TiO2 planes. Labels of oxygen atoms correspond to\nthose in Fig. 1(a).\n\nB. Atomistic domain wall structure\n\nWe begin by analyzing how much the ferroelectric distortions along the z direction are changed by the presence\nof a domain wall. To give a quantitative description we\ncompute an average ferroelectric distortion \u03b4FE for each\natomic plane parallel to the domain wall. As a measure\nfor \u03b4FE we take the displacement of the metal atom relative to an oxygen atom in the PbO or TiO2 plane.23,24\n(In the case of a TiO2 plane, we choose the oxygen ion\nlying along the z direction from the Ti atom.) We then\ndefine the parameter Rz as the ratio between \u03b4FE of the\nspecified lattice plane and its value in the undistorted\nferroelectric bulk phase. Rz is a very sensitive indicator\nof the ferroelectric order: Rz is zero as long as the atoms\nare in their cubic positions, and tends to unity as the full\nbulk ferroelectric distortion is attained.\nThe results for the distortion Rz are illustrated in\nFig. 2 for both Pb\u2013centered and Ti\u2013centered domain\nwalls. Only the results from the 50-atom supercells are\nshown; results for smaller cells are essentially identical.\nWe focus our discussion here on the more physical Pb\u2013\ncentered domain wall. We find that Rz = 0.80 already for\nthe TiO2 first-neighbor plane (to be compared with the\nvalue of 0.73 reported in Ref. 6), and the ferroelectric distortion is essentially fully recovered to its bulk value by\nthe PbO second-layer plane. The orientation of the polarization thus changes abruptly over a distance of less than\ntwo lattice constants, leading to a very narrow domain\nwall. The narrowness of the 180\u25e6 domain wall had earlier\n\nbeen predicted based on phenomenological models1 and\nconfirmed using atomic force microscopy (AFM).29 The\nresults for the Ti\u2013centered wall are qualitatively similar.\nIn the next step we analyze for the Pb\u2013centered domain\nwall how the atomic rows are aligned across the wall. As\nalready indicated in Fig. 2, there is a considerable offset\nbetween [100] atomic rows to the left and right of the\ndomain wall. Fig. 3 shows the detailed results for the z\ndisplacements of the atom rows relative to the Pb ion in\nthe domain wall. The discontinuity in the [100] rows is\nlargest for the Pb atoms, where we find a jump of 14.5 %\nof the lattice constant c. This offset of 0.6 \u00c5 should be\nclearly visible in an HRTEM image, thus allowing identification of 180\u25e6 domain walls having polarization parallel\nto the surface in the neighboring domains.\nIt is not surprising that the largest offset occurs for the\nPb rows, since the Pb displacement contributes most to\nthe ferroelectric soft-mode vector (see Table I). By compensating for the different contributions of the atoms to\nthe ferroelectric soft-mode vector, we can define a kind of\n\"geometrical offset\" between neighboring domains.

Having identified the Ti\u2013centered domain wall as the saddle\npoint configuration for the motion of a 180\u25e6 domain wall,\nthe barrier height for a jump to the nearest-neighbor lattice position is given by the difference between the wall\nenergies of the Ti\u2013 and Pb\u2013centered walls.

The offsets of the resulting\natomic rows are now the same for all five atoms, and\nthis joint offset therefore provides a reasonable measure\nof the geometrical misalignment.

RESULTS FOR THE 90\u25e6 DOMAIN WALL\nA. Domain wall energy\n\nFor an accurate calculation of the domain-wall energy,\nit is indispensable to reduce all effects of systematic errors\nas far as possible, since an uncertainty of only 10 meV in\nthe energy difference between the supercell calculation\nand the reference structure already leads to an inaccuracy of 7.5 mJ/m2 in the domain-wall energy. Because of\nthe particular shape of the supercells representing the 90\u25e6\ndomain wall (as described in Sec. II B), it is not possible\nto construct equivalent k\u2013point meshes for the supercells\nand single perovskite unit cells (in contrast to the 180\u25e6\ncase). To get good energy differences between the relaxed\nstructures and the bulk reference, we applied the following procedure for calculating the domain-wall energies.\nFirst, for the full atomic relaxation of the supercells, we\nused our regular (2,4,4) Monkhorst-Pack k\u2013point mesh.\nThen, to reduce the k\u2013point errors further, we reran the\ntotal-energy calculation of the supercell with a denser\n(2,6,6) Monkhorst-Pack mesh. The reference energy of\nthe bulk structure was computed from a single perovskite\nunit cell using a k\u2013point mesh with the same density and\nan orientation that corresponds as closely as possible to\nthe supercell (2,6,6) Monkhorst-Pack mesh. Specifically,\nwe employed a (N ,6,6) Moreno-Soler k\u2013point mesh30 oriented along the [101], [010], and [1\u030401] directions (see\nFig. 1(c)).\nThe results for the 90\u25e6 domain-wall energies from the\nvarious supercells are given in Table III. The convergence of the wall energy with supercell size is somewhat\nslower than for the 180\u25e6 case, but the energy is well\nconverged for a wall separation of five perovskite unit\n\nC. Barrier for domain wall motion\n\nMany models have been proposed in the literature for\nthe motion of domain walls in crystals. Most realistic\nmodels involve the formation and propagation of kinks of\nvarious shapes, allowing the domain wall to shift gradually to its new position. It is not our aim here to comment\non or distinguish between these models; instead, we concentrate only on extracting one parameter that may be\nneeded in many models of this type. Specifically, we compute the barrier height for coherent motion of the entire\ndomain wall to its neighboring lattice position. Thus, our\ncalculations always preserve full translational symmetry\nparallel to the domain wall.\nWe made a simple estimate for the path in configuration space along which a Pb\u2013centered domain wall may\ngradually transform into a Ti\u2013centered wall as follows.\nWe took the atomic configurations \u03be Pb and \u03be Ti of Pb\u2013\nand Ti\u2013centered walls on neighboring lattice planes and\nformed the linear interpolation \u03be Pb + \u03bb(\u03be Ti \u2212 \u03be Pb ), where\n\u03bb has the interpretation of being a reaction coordinate\nalong the path. The energy profile along this path is\nshown in Fig. 4. The configurations of the Pb\u2013 and Ti\u2013\ncentered domain wall are local minima and maxima of\nthe energy curve, respectively, with no barrier between\nthem. The Ti\u2013centered wall is therefore metastable and\nwill transform spontaneously into a Pb\u2013centered domain\n6\n\n\fTi\u2212centered\n\ncells. The calculated value of 35 mJ/m2 is in reasonable agreement with a rough estimate of 50 mJ/m2 from\na HRTEM experiment.9 The energy of the 90\u25e6 domain\nwall is thus calculated to be about four times lower than\nthat of its 180\u25e6 counterpart, and we can conclude that\nthe 90\u25e6 domain wall is the most stable wall configuration\nin PbTiO3 .\n\nPb\u2212centered\n\nM\u2212centered\n\nFIG. 5. Sketch of the three different choices of unit cells\nused for the calculation of local polarization via Born effective charges. Shown is the projection on the x\u2013z\u2013plane (see\nFig. 1(a)).\n\nB. Domain wall structure and polarization profile\n\nIn the case of the 180\u25e6 domain wall the analysis of\nhow the ferroelectric distortions change in the vicinity of\nthe domain wall was relatively straightforward, since the\nquestion could be treated as a one-dimensional problem\n(the relaxation of the atoms in the x\u2013direction, perpendicular to the domain wall, being completely negligible).\nIn contrast, for the 90\u25e6 domain wall the two-dimensional\nrelaxations of the atoms lead to a complex relaxation pattern for which an analysis in terms of average ferroelectric\ndistortions \u03b4FE and their ratio relative to the bulk value\nRz would be difficult to repeat.\nTherefore, to simplify the discussion of the changes in\nthe ferroelectric distortions, we have chosen to visualize\nthe atomic displacements by translating them into a \"polarization P(i) per unit cell i \" as follows. First, we have\nto decide what we mean by a \"unit cell\" in the context of\nthe domain-wall structure. Figure 5 shows three possible\nways of doing this. For the 'Ti-centered' choice, for example, the unit cell contains the central Ti atom, but the six\nneighboring O atoms are each shared by two unit cells,\nand the eight neighboring Pb atoms are each shared by\neight unit cells. Thus we assign weights w Ti =1, w O =1/2,\nand w Pb =1/8 to describe the association of atoms to\nthe unit cell. Two other choices are the 'Pb-centered'\nand 'M-centered' (metal-centered) cells, also illustrated\nin Fig. 5. The M-centered cell is the most compact in the\nx direction; it therefore gives the finest possible resolution to the function P(x) in the case of the 90\u25e6 domain\nwall, which consists of alternate Pb\u2013Ti\u2013O\u2013 and O\u2013O\u2013\ntype (101) planes stacked along x (see Fig. 1(c)). Next,\nwe attach a polarization to each unit cell i via the assignment\ne X\n(i)\nP(i) =\nw\u03b1 Z\u2217\u03b1 * u\u03b1\n.\n(1)\n\u03a9c \u03b1\n\nthis case, Eq. (1) simply gives the bulk macroscopic polarization. In the inhomogeneous case the spatial decomposition indicated by Eq. (1) is somewhat arbitrary, but\nwe think that it is a rather natural choice. Of course,\nthe cell-by-cell polarization now depends on the choice\nof unit cell in Fig. 5. Moreover, in principal it would be\nnecessary to calculate the Born effective charge tensor for\neach atom in the neighborhood of the domain wall, since\nthese will differ from the bulk-like values. Here, we make\nthe further assumption of using the cubic bulk effective\ncharge tensors in Eq. (1). Previous work has shown that\nthe Z\u2217\u03b1 matrix elements change by less than 10 % in going\nfrom the cubic to the tetragonal phase of PbTiO3 .18 We\nexpect a variation of similar magnitude for the atoms in\nthe interior of the domain wall. Moreover, the sum rule\nfor the Born effective charges guarantees that a simple\nuniform translation of the entire contents of the domainwall supercell will not change the P(i) values at all. We\ntherefore think this is a reasonable approximation. However, it is clear that the results presented on the basis of\nthis approximation should be regarded mainly as a visualization of the complex atomic relaxation pattern, not\nas a realistic calculation of the spatial polarization field.\nIn fact, one should keep in mind that defining a local polarization is an intrinsically subtle task. The polarization\nis a macroscopic quantity, and there is always some ambiguity when this concept is transferred to an atomistic\nlevel.\nFor the Born effective charges Z\u03b1\u2217 we took the theoretical values for the cubic structure of PbTiO3 as calculated\nby Zhong, King-Smith and Vanderbilt.18 Using Eq. (1)\ntogether with the atomic displacements from Table I we\nget a bulk polarization of 89.5 \u03bcC/cm2 . This result is\nonly slightly larger than the value of 81.2 \u03bcC/cm2 calculated directly24 with the Berry-phase approach.17 All\nthree unit cells in Fig. 5 are centered around a Pb\u2013Ti\u2013O\nplane; we therefore assign the calculated local polarizations to the corresponding Pb\u2013Ti\u2013O planes and plot the\npolarization profiles as a function of the positions of these\nplanes.\nSuch a plot is shown in Fig. 6. The corresponding\ncurves are least-square fits to functions of the form\n\nHere e is the electron charge, \u03a9c the volume of the fiveatom bulk unit cell, index \u03b1 runs over all atoms of unit\n(i)\ncell i, u\u03b1 is the displacement of atom \u03b1 from its cubic\nposition, and w\u03b1 are the weight factors introduced above.\nThe Z\u2217\u03b1 are the Born effective charge tensors, which are\napproximated by their cubic bulk values as discussed below.\nFor the case of a homogeneous system having the primitive five-atom periodicity, Eq. (1) is independent of cell\nindex i, and even of the choice of unit cell in Fig. 5; in\n\n7\n\n\fPx (x) = Px,0 \u2212 A sech2\n\n\u0012\n\nx \u2212 x0\n\u03be DW\n\n\u0013\n\n69.5\n\n(2)\n\n69.0\n\nand\n(3)\n\n2\n\nx \u2212 x0\n\u03be DW\n\n\u0013\n\nPx [\u03bcC/cm ]\n\nPz (x) = Pz,0 tanh\n\n\u0012\n\nwhere Px,0 and Pz,0 specify the polarization deep in\nthe domain interior, and x0 and 2\u03be DW correspond to\nthe center-position and width of the domain wall respectively. (The factor of two in 2\u03be DW is a convention\nthat is included to facilitate comparison with experimental reports that use this convention.9,11 ) Eq. (3) is the\nsoliton solution for a domain wall in a one-dimensional\nfourth-order Landau-Ginzburg-type theory.4 However,\nsince PbTiO3 is a proper ferroelectric (or improper ferroelastic), it would be more appropriate to use the result\nof a sixth-order Landau-Ginzburg theory.3,31 The solution for a domain wall would then be\n\u0010\n\u0011\n0\nsinh x\u2212x\n\u03be DW\nPz (x) = Pz,0 h\n(4)\n\u0011i1/2\n\u0010\n0\nB + sinh2 x\u2212x\n\u03be DW\n\n68.5\n\n68.0\n\n67.5\n\n67.0\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nposititon of Pb\u2212Ti\u2212O\u2212type (101) plane\n\n10\n\n60\nTi\u2212centered\nPb\u2212centered\nM\u2212centered\n\n40\n\n2\n\nPz [\u03bcC/cm ]\n\n20\n\nwhich is identical to Eq. (3) for B=1. Since B=1.4 has\nbeen reported for PbTiO4 ,9 the deviation between the\ntwo expressions is not very large.\nIn Fig. 6, the component of the polarization parallel to\nthe domain wall Pz changes its sign very abruptly over a\ndistance of less than three lattice spacings between Pb\u2013\nTi\u2013O\u2013type (101) planes. Furthermore, it can be seen that\n(i)\nthe results for the local polarizations Pz do not depend\nstrongly on the choice of unit cell. For the Ti\u2013 and Pb\u2013\ncentered cell they are almost indistinguishable, and for\nthe M\u2013centered cell the polarization changes even more\nrapidly. Thus, as expected, the M\u2013centered cell gives\nthe finest resolution for the polarization rotation in the\ndomain wall.\nFrom the fits to Eq. (3) we find in all three cases\na domain wall position that is very nearly halfway between two Pb\u2013Ti\u2013O planes. Thus, from an electrostatic\npoint of view, the domain wall can be regarded as being essentially centered on an O\u2013O\u2013plane. For the domain wall width we find a value of 2\u03be DW = 5\u00b10.5 \u00c5. This\neven somewhat narrower than the results of 10\u00b13 \u00c5 and\n15\u00b13 \u00c5 suggested by recent experiment.9,11 However, it\nhas to be kept in mind that the experiments were done at\nroom temperature, whereas our calculations are for zero\ntemperature.\nFigure 6 shows that the component of the polarization perpendicular to the domain wall is almost constant,\nshowing only a small reduction as it crosses the domain\n(i)\nwall. The local polarizations Px scatter a little bit more\nwith the choice of unit cell than in the case of the par(i)\nallel components Pz , and it is more difficult to obtain\nmeaningful fits to analytic curves.

The sym(i)\n(i)\nbols represent the local polarizations Px and Pz as obtained\nusing the three different choices of the unit cell illustrated in\nFig. 5; solid, dotted and dashed lines are fits using Ti\u2013, Pb\u2013\nand M\u2013centered unit cells, respectively.\n(i)\n\nof Pz .) Despite the larger variations between the fit(i)\nted curves, in all three cases the minimum of Px lies\nnear the same O\u2013O plane where Pz crosses through zero.\n(i)\nThus, the analysis of the Px curves reinforces the interpretation that the domain wall is centered on an O\u2013O\natomic plane.\nIn a full three-dimensional treatment of a LandauGinzburg model Cao and Cross3 found a quasi-onedimensional solution for the polarization profile across\n90\u25e6 domain walls with a constant perpendicular component Px (x). However, this analytic solution was obtained\nfor a special choice of parameters in the Landau-Ginzburg\nfunctional, and our result of a varying Px (x) is not in contradiction with their final system of differential equations\nfor the general case.\n(i)\nFinally, we note that while the reduction in Px in the\ninterior of the domain wall appears rather small, it may\n\n8\n\n\f36.0\n2\n\nDW energy [mJ/m ]\n\nfluctuations, a barrier height of 1.6 mJ/m2 over the area\nof 12 perovskite unit cells corresponds roughly to kB T\nat room temperature. Therefore, as long as no pinning\ncenters are present, the domain wall may be expected\nto fluctuate rather freely except at very low temperature. Clearly, it will be important to take this behavior\ninto account when interpreting experimental probes of\nthe widths and other properties of the 90\u25e6 domain walls.\n\nestimated\nsaddle point\n\n35.5\n\n35.0\n\nD.

II B we pointed out that the left and right sides\nof a 90\u25e6 domain wall are not related by any symmetry\noperation. It follows that the charge distribution across\nthe domain wall may have the character of a dipole layer,\nsuch that the macroscopic electrostatic potential would\nexperience a step across the domain wall. As a general\nrule, if something is not prevented by symmetry, it should\nbe present. For example, all wurzite crystals have some\nspontaneous polarization, since it is not prevented by\nsymmetry; the only question is how large it may be. By\nthe same token, since a step in the electrostatic potential\nis not ruled out by symmetry, it should exist for any 90\u25e6\ndomain wall in a ferroelectric material. The issue then\nis to determine the sign and magnitude of such a step.\nOf course, it might have turned out to be insignificantly\nsmall, but we show now that this is not the case.\nIn Sec. IV B we found that the component Px of the\npolarization perpendicular to the domain wall is slightly\nreduced in the interior of the domain wall. A decreasing\n(increasing) polarization on the left (right) side of the domain wall leads to an accumulation of positive (negative)\ncharge, as is sketched in Fig. 8(a). Thus, the dip in Px\nvisible in Fig. 6(a) is a direct fingerprint of the existence\nof such a dipole layer. As a consequence, the electrostatic\npotential should jump from one side of the domain wall\nto the other, leading to band offsets for both the valence\nand conduction bands (see Fig. 8(b)). Mathematically, if\nv(r) is the electron potential energy, Poisson's equation\n\nFIG. 7.

We return to this point in Sec. IV D.\nC. Barrier for domain wall motion\n\nAs in the case of the 180\u25e6 domain wall, we address\nhere only the situation in which the entire 90\u25e6 domain\nwall moves coherently from one (101) lattice plane to the\nnext, preserving periodicity parallel to the wall. For the\npath in configuration space along which this transformation occurs, we again formed the linear interpolation\n\u03ben + \u03bb(\u03ben+1 \u2212 \u03ben ) between the atomic configurations \u03ben\nand \u03ben+1 of two fully relaxed supercells with domain wall\npositions on nearest-neighbor (101) lattice planes.\nThe energies of these atomic configurations are plotted\nas a function of \u03bb in Fig. 7. The energy profile is found to\nbe a rather featureless cosine-like curve with a maximum\nat \u03bb \u2248 0.5. The energy at this maximum provides an estimate of the barrier height Ebarrier for the translation\nof a 90\u25e6 domain wall to a neighboring lattice plane. To\nbe more precise, it gives an upper bound for the actual\nbarrier, since our assumed path is only an approximation to the true one. To refine this estimate further, we\ninspected the forces remaining on the atoms at our estimated saddle-point configuration at \u03bb = 0.5. These forces\nwere very small, only slightly above the convergence criteria used in the structural optimization process. Following a line minimization in configuration space along\nthe direction given by this force vector, the barrier height\nwas lowered by less than 0.15 mJ/m2 .\nThe results for Ebarrier obtained using various supercells are listed in Table III. At about 1.6 mJ/m2 , this\nbarrier is extremely small. It is only \u223c4 % of the creation energy of the 90\u25e6 domain wall, to be compared with\nthe 180\u25e6 case where the barrier height is \u223c30 % of the\ndomain-wall energy.

(7) and then take sliding-window averages\nZ\n\nL/2\n\nv\u0304(x\u2032 ) dx\u2032\n\n0\n\u22120.05\n\u22120.1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9 10\npostition of Pb\u2212Ti\u2212O\u2212type (101) plane\n\n11\n\n12\n\nthe supercell boundary. Thus, instead of a step-like behavior as in Figs. 8(a), we expect a zig-zag behavior as\nshown in Fig. 8(c).\nDespite using the sliding-window average, the electrostatic potential in Fig. 9 still contains substantial noise\narising from the different atomic relaxations in the atomic\nplanes parallel to the domain wall. Nevertheless, the expected zig-zag behavior is evident, as indicated by the\ndashed lines. In particular, the potential jump is very\nclose to the expected location where Pz changes sign between two Pb\u2013Ti\u2013O planes (compare with Figs. 6 and 9),\nand the height \u2206v = 0.16 eV of the jump is in very good\nagreement with our previous estimate of 0.18 eV based\nsolely upon atomic positions, without any information\nabout the electrostatic potential.\nWe end this section with a few remarks on the effects\nof the artificial electric field that is introduced in our\nsupercell calculation by the dipole layer at the domain\nwall. The strength of this field depends on the supercell\nsize and decreases only linearly with reciprocal domainwall separation. It will therefore have some effects on the\natomic relaxations. For example, if we look at the local\npolarization in the center of the domains, Table IV, we\nsee that the angle \u03b1 of the polarization with the x axis is\nnot arctan(c/a) = 46.3\u25e6, as would be expected for an ideally twinned crystal, but is slightly reduced. The tilt of\nthe polarization toward the x axis can be seen to decrease\nwith supercell size, and the angle \u03b1 converges toward it\nideal value. Furthermore, the amplitude of the polarization in the center of the domains is slightly larger than\nin the undisturbed bulk system. It is natural to interpret this excess polarization as having been induced by\nthe artificial electric field. A rough estimate shows that\nfor the electric field that is present, such an increase in\nthe polarization can be expected if we assume a dielectric constant of roughly 50, which is not unreasonable.\nOverall, these small effects of the artificial electric field\nare most likely the origin of the slower convergence with\nsupercell size of the domain-wall energy and migration\nbarrier height compared to the 180\u25e6 case, where no such\nelectric field is present.\n\nv(x)\n\n1\nve(x) =\nL\n\n0.05\n\nFIG. 9.

The situation sketched in\nFig. 8(a) is incompatible with such boundary conditions;\nalthough the charge density is periodic, the potential is\nnot. In all practical DFT/LDA calculations, the potential is obtained by solving Poisson's equation under periodic boundary conditions, resulting in a periodic potential as sketched in Fig. 8(c).

SUMMARY\n\nWe wish to thank Jim Scott and Sami P\u00f6ykk\u00f6 for useful discussions. This work is supported by the ONR grant\nN00014-97-1-0048.\n\n\u25e6\n\nIn summary, we have studied the properties of 180\nand 90\u25e6 domain walls in PbTiO3 using density-functional\ntheory and the local-density approximation. Metastable\nsupercells representing both kinds of domain walls were\nconstructed, and the fully relaxed atomic configurations\nof the domain walls were obtained by minimizing the\nresidual forces on the ions.\nIn the 180\u25e6 case, the domain wall located on a Pb\u2013O\nlattice plane is lowest in energy, whereas the Ti\u2013centered\nwall is a saddle point configuration that spontaneously\ntransforms into a Pb\u2013centered wall. The domain wall is\nfound to be very narrow, with a width on the order of\nthe lattice constant a, and the energy to create a 180\u25e6\ndomain wall is calculated to be 132 mJ/m2 , in very good\nagreement with a previous ab-initio study.\nFor the 90\u25e6 domain wall we found a much lower\ndomain-wall energy of 35 mJ/m2 . From the polarization\nprofile across the domain wall we obtained the position\nof the wall to be halfway between Pb\u2013Ti\u2013O planes. We\nalso find a domain-wall width of 5\u00b10.5 \u00c5, the same order\nof magnitude as for the 180\u25e6 wall. This conclusion about\nthe narrowness of the 90\u25e6 domain wall is in line with two\nrecent HRTEM experiments. Together, these works indicate that the conventional wisdom, which holds that the\n90\u25e6 domain wall is much broader than its 180\u25e6 counterpart, does not hold true in PbTiO3 .\nOn the other hand, the barrier height for the coherent motion of a 90\u25e6 domain wall to a neighboring lattice plane is estimated to be very small. The domain\nwall can easily move so that a scenario where the domain wall is pinned at defects and fluctuates widely in\nbetween is very likely to occur in real samples. The apparent width of the domain boundary may therefore be\nmuch broader, raising the question as to what exactly\nwe mean by the \"width of a domain wall.\" In this regard, our result 2\u03be DW = 5\u00b10.5 \u00c5 for an ideal, defect-free\nwall should be regarded as a intrinsic width of the domain boundary at zero temperature, whereas at finite\ntemperatures the domain wall may be smeared out by\nfluctuations.
