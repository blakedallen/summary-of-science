In the latter case, a link\nwith Suspect, SOFTSUSY, Spheno and Isajet allows to calculate the supersymmetric spectrum,\nHiggs masses, as well as mixing matrices.

In particular the b \u2192 s\u03b3 routine\nincludes an improved NLO for the SM and the charged Higgs while the SUSY large tan \u03b2 effects\nbeyond leading-order are included. This new version also provides cross-sections for any 2 \u2192 2\nprocess as well as partial decay widths for two-body final states in the MSSM allowing for easy\nsimulation at colliders.\n\nLAPTH-1044\nFebruary 1, 2008\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nWe present micrOMEGAs1.3, a program which calculates the relic density of the lightest\nsupersymmetric particle (LSP) in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM).\nThe stable LSP, which occurs in supersymmetric models with R parity conservation,\nconstitutes a good candidate for cold dark matter. Recent measurements from WMAP[1]\nhave in fact constrained the value for the relic density within 10%,\n.094 < \u03a9h2 < .128\n\nat 2\u03c3.\n\nForthcoming experiments by the PLANCK satellite[2] will pin-down this important parameter to within 2%. One therefore needs to evaluate the relic density with high accuracy.\nThe relic density calculation is based on solving the equation characterizing the evolution of the number density of the LSP. For this, one needs to evaluate the thermally\naveraged cross-section for annihilation of the LSP, as well as, when necessary, coannihilation with other supersymmetric (SUSY) particles [3, 4, 5]. We use, as in micrOMEGAs1.1\n[6], the method described in [7] for the relativistic treatment of the thermally averaged\ncross-section, and the generalization of [8] to the case of coannihilation. However we have\nimproved our method for solving the density evolution equation, it is now solved numerically without using the freeze-out approximation. This improvement has not impaired\nthe speed of the calculation.\nThe other main improvement to micrOMEGAs1.3 is the use of loop corrected superparticle masses and mixing matrices. These masses and mixing matrices, as specified in\nthe SUSY Les Houches Accord (SLHA)[9], are then used to compute exactly all annihilation/coannihilation cross-sections. This can be done whether the input parameters are\nspecified at the weak scale or at the GUT scale in the context of SUGRA models or the\nlike. In the last case, loop corrections are obtained from one of the public codes which\ncalculate the supersymmetric spectrum using renormalization group equations (RGE)\n[10, 11, 12, 13]. These corrections to masses are critical for a precise computation of the\nrelic density in two specific regions: the coannihilation region and the region where annihilation through a Higgs or Z exchange occurs near resonance. Note that these regions of\nthe supersymmetric parameter space are among the ones where one predicts sufficiently\nhigh annihilation rates for the neutralino LSP to meet the WMAP upper bound on the\nrelic density. In the first case, the critical parameter is the NLSP-LSP mass difference, in\nthe latter the mass difference 2MLSP \u2212 mH/Z [14]. The Higgs masses are calculated either\n\nby one of the RGE codes or with FeynHiggsFast[15]. When annihilation occurs near a\nHiggs resonance, higher-order corrections to the width also need to be taken into account.\nAs in micrOMEGAs1.1, QCD corrections to Higgs partial widths are included, furthermore\n\n\fwe have added the important SUSY corrections, the \u2206mb correction, that are relevant at\nlarge tan \u03b2. These higher-order corrections also affect directly the Higgs-qq vertices and\nare taken into account in all the relevant annihilation cross-sections.\nBesides the relic density measurement, other direct or indirect precision measurements\nconstrain the supersymmetric models. In our package we calculate the supersymmetric\ncontribution to (g \u2212 2)\u03bc and to \u2206\u03c1. We also include a new calculation of the supersym-\n\nmetric contribution to Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 and an improved calculation of the b \u2192 s\u03b3 decay rate.\nThe latter includes an improved NLO for the SM and the charged Higgs contribution\nas well as the SUSY large tan \u03b2 effects beyond leading-order, the \u2206mb correction. The\nb \u2192 s\u03b3, Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 or (g \u2212 2)\u03bc routines can be replaced or used as a stand-alone code.\nWithin micrOMEGAs1.3 all (co-)annihilation cross-sections are compiled by CalcHEP [16]\nwhich is included in the package. CalcHEP is an automatic program to calculate tree-level\ncross-sections for any process in a given model, here the MSSM. We provide a code that\nperforms the calculation of cross-sections and decay widths that can be called independently of the relic density calculation. The input parameters are the parameters of the\nSUSY Les Houches Accord. Another new feature is the possibility to call CalcHEP, directly\nfrom a micrOMEGAs1.3 session, and calculate interactively cross-sections for any process\nin the MSSM or in mSUGRA models. For this, all widths of supersymmetric particles\nare evaluated automatically at tree-level, including the available two-body decay modes.\nThe relic density as well as other constraints are also calculated in the CalcHEP session.\nIn summary, the new program micrOMEGAs1.3\n\u2022 Calculates complete tree-level matrix elements for all subprocesses.\n\u2022 Includes all coannihilation channels, in particular channels with neutralinos, charginos,\nsleptons, squarks and gluinos.\n\u2022 Calculates the relic density for any LSP, not necessarily the lightest neutralino.\n\u2022 \u2217 Deals with two sets of input parameters: parameters of the MSSM understood to\nbe specified at the EWSB scale or parameters of the SUGRA model specified at the\nGUT scale. Both mSUGRA or non-universal SUGRA models are included.\n\n\u2022 \u2217 Provides an interface with the main codes to calculate the supersymmetric spectrum: Suspect [10], Isajet [13], Spheno [12] and SOFTSUSY [11].\n\n\u2022 \u2217 Includes an interface with the SUSY Les Houches Accord [9] for supersymmetric\n\nmodel specifications and input parameters. This gives a lot of flexibility as any\nmodel for which the MSSM spectrum is calculated by an external code can be\nincorporated easily.\n\n\f\u2022 \u2217 Includes loop corrected sparticle masses and mixing matrices.\n\u2022 \u2217 Includes loop-corrected Higgs masses and widths. QCD corrections to the Higgs\ncouplings to fermion pairs are included as well as, via an effective Lagrangian, the\n\u2206mb correction relevant at large tan \u03b2.\n\n\u2022 \u2217 Provides exact numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation by Runge-Kutta.\n\u2022 Outputs the relative contribution of each channel to 1/\u03a9\n\u2022 \u2217 Computes cross-sections for any 2 \u2192 2 process at the parton level.\n\u2022 \u2217 Calculates decay widths for all particles at tree-level including all 1 \u2192 2 decay\nmodes.\n\u2022 \u2217 Calculates NLO corrections to b \u2192 s\u03b3.\n\u2022 \u2217 Calculates constraints on MSSM: (g \u2212 2)\u03bc , \u2206\u03c1, Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 .\n\u2022 \u2217 Supports both C and Fortran.\n\u2022 Performs rapidly the relic density calculation, the limiting factor in the execution\ntime of the program is the computation of the supersymmetric spectrum.\n\nNew features in the list above are denoted by a star. In this paper we emphasize mainly\nthe new features of our package, full details can be found in the original reference [6]. In\nSection 2, we describe the main changes to our calculation of the relic density. We then\ngive the parameters of the supersymmetric model used in our package. A description of the\npackage follows in Section 4. Section 5 gives instructions for running the program as well as\nsample sessions. Finally in Section 6 we compare our results with those of DarkSUSY4.0\n[17], the other public package that computes the relic density of supersymmetric dark\nmatter.\n\n2\n\nCalculation of the relic density\n\nThe most complete formulae for the calculation of the abundance Y (T ) were presented\nin [7, 8] and we will follow their approach rather closely. The evolution equation for the\nabundance, defined as the number density divided by the entropy density, writes\ndY\n=\ndT\n\ns\n\n\u03c0g\u2217 (T )\nMp < \u03c3v > (Y (T )2 \u2212 Yeq (T )2 )\n45\n\n(2.1)\n\n\fwhere g\u2217 is an effective number of degree of freedom [7], Mp is the Planck mass and\nYeq (T ) the thermal equilibrium abundance. < \u03c3v > is the relativistic thermally averaged\nannihilation cross-section of superparticles summed over all channels,\n\u221a\n\u221a\nR\nP\nds sK1 ( s/T )p2ij \u03c3ij (s)\ngi gj\n< \u03c3v >=\n\ni,j\n\n(mi +mj )2\n\n2T (\n\nP\ni\n\ngim2i K2 (mi /T ))2\n\n,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere gi is the number of degree of freedom, \u03c3ij the total cross section for annihilation\nof a pair of supersymmetric particles with masses mi , mj into some Standard Model\n\u221a\nparticles, and pij ( s) is the momentum (total energy) of the incoming particles in their\ncenter-of-mass frame.\nIntegrating Eq. 2.1 from T = \u221e to T = T0 leads to the present day abundance Y (T0 )\nneeded in the estimation of the relic density,\n\u03a9LSP h2 =\n\nMLSP\ns(T0 )\n8\u03c0\nMLSP Y (T0 ) = 2.742 \u00d7 108\nY (T0 )\n2\n2\n3 Mp (100(km/s/Mpc))\nGeV\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere s(T0 ) is the entropy density at present time and h the normalized Hubble constant.\nThe present-day energy density is then simply expressed as \u03c1LSP = 10.54\u03a9h2 (GeV /m3 ).\nLet us rewrite Eq. 2.1 in terms of X = T /MLSP\ndY\n= A(X)(Yeq (X)2 \u2212 Y (X)2 )\ndX\nMLSP\nA(X) =\nX2\n\ns\n\n\u03c0g\u2217 (MLSP /X)\nMp < \u03c3v >\n45\n\n(2.4)\n\n(2.5)\n\nFirst note that one will always have Y (X) \u2248 Yeq (X) when A(X)Yeq (X) \u226b 1. This is\nthe case at X \u2264 1 since the equilibrium abundance Yeq (X) \u2248 O(1) [7, 8] and for a typical\nelectroweak cross-section , < \u03c3v >\u2248 10\u221210 GeV \u22122 , and LSP mass, MLSP \u2248 100GeV , one\n\nhas A \u2248 1010 . Choosing a starting point for the solution of the numerical equation at\nsmall X will rapidly return the solution Y = Yeq . On the other hand when X > 1, Yeq (X)\ndecreases exponentially as e\u2212X . Then neglecting the dependence on X in both A(X) and\nYeq (X)eX we get\n1\n(2.6)\n\u2206Y = Y (X) \u2212 Yeq (X) =\n2A\nwhere \u2206Y \u226a Yeq . In this approximation, \u2206Y does not depend on X, whereas Yeq (X)\ndecreases exponentially. This can be used to find a starting point Xf1 for the numerical solution of the differential equation (2.4). In order to find Xf1 where \u2206Y (Xf1 ) = \u03b4 Yeq (Xf1 )\n\none can solve\nYeq (Xf1 )\u2032 = A(Xf1 ) \u2217 Yeq (Xf1 )2 \u03b4(\u03b4 + 2)\n\n(2.7)\n\n\fIn the darkOmega routine we use this equation to find Xf1 , Y (Xf1 ) corresponding to\n\u03b4 = 0.1 and solve the differential equation (2.4) by the Runge-Kutta method starting\nfrom this point [18]. We stop the Runge-Kutta run at point Xf2 where\n1\nY (Xf2 ) .\n10\nThen we integrate Eq. 2.4 neglecting the term Yeq (X)\nYeq (Xf2 ) <\n\n1\n1\n=\n+\nY (X0 )\nY (Xf2 )\n\nZ\n\nX0\nXf2\n\nA(X)dX .\n\n(2.8)\n\n(2.9)\n\nNote that the temperature T0 = 2.725K corresponds to X0 \u2248 1014 . Thus without loss of\nprecision we can set X0 = \u221e for evaluating Y0 since A(X) \u221d 1/X 2 .\n\nAnother routine darkOmegaFO performs the calculation in the freeze-out approximation2 . Here we choose \u03b4 = 1.5 as in Ref.[7] and omit the Runge-Kutta step (Xf = Xf1 =\nXf2 ). The precision of this approximation is about 2% although in some exotic cases the\napproximation works badly.\nAs in micrOMEGAs1.1, we include in the thermally averaged cross-section , Eq. 2.2,\nonly the contribution of processes for which the Boltzmann suppression factor, B, is\nabove some value B\u01eb\nB=\n\n(m +m \u22122mLSP )\nK1 ((mi + mj )/T )\n\u2212X i mj\nLSP\n\u2248e\n> B\u01eb\nK1 (2mLSP /T )\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhere mi , mj are the masses of the incoming superparticles. The recommended value is\nB\u01eb = 10\u22126 [6].\nIn our program we provide two options to do the integrations, the fast one and the\naccurate one. The fast mode already gives a precision of about 1% which is good enough\nfor all practical purposes. The accurate mode should be used only for some checks.\nIn the accurate mode the program evaluates all integrals by means of an adaptative\nSimpson program. It automatically detects all singularities of the integrand and checks\nthe precision. In the case of the fast mode the accuracy is not checked. We integrate the\nsquared matrix elements over the scattering angle by means of a 5 points Gauss formula.\nFor integration over s, Eq. 2.2, we use a restricted set of points which depends whether we\nare in the vicinity of a s-channel Higgs/Z/W resonance or not. We increase the number\nof points if the Boltzmann factor corresponding to mpole is larger than 0.01B\u01eb .\n\n2.1\n\nDecays of the Higgs scalars\n\nWhen the LSP is near a Higgs resonance, it annihilates very efficiently. The value of\nthe neutralino annihilation cross-section depends on the total width if this width is larger\n2\n\nThis function was used in the original version of micrOMEGAs[6].\n\n\fthan \u2248 Tf /Xf , the freeze-out temperature. This is usually the case for large Higgs masses\nof 1TeV especialy at large tan \u03b2 due to the enhancement in the bb channel. However the\nwidth of h(H, A) \u2192 bb\u0304 receives important QCD corrections. Typically for the heavy\nHiggses (mH > 1TeV) the partial width into q q\u0304 can vary easily by a factor of 2 from the\ntree-level prediction, due mostly to the running of the quark mass at high scale. To take\nthese corrections into account we have redefined the vertices hqq, Hqq and Aqq using an\neffective mass that reproduces the radiatively corrected Higgs decays [19]. The effective\nmass at the scale Q writes\ni\n\nh\n\n2\n3\n2\n2\nMef\nf (Q) = M(Q) 1 + 5.67a + (35.94 \u2212 1.36nf )a + (164.14 \u2212 nf (25.77 \u2212 0.259nf ))a\n(2.11)\n\nwhere a = \u03b1s (Q)/\u03c0, the scale of the reaction is set to Q = 2m\u03c7\u030301 , M(Q) and \u03b1s (Q) are the\nquark masses and running strong coupling in the MS-scheme. We use NNLO expressions\nfor the strong coupling constants [20] and for the running quark masses [19, 21]. The\nrelation between the MS and the pole quark masses are implemented at three-loops\n[20, 21]. These are relevant for the top quark, since we use the pole mass as input\nfollowing the SUSY Les Houches Accord [9]. For b-quark, although mb (mb )M S is the input\nparameter, it is still necessary to compute the pole mass used as an input parameter to\nsome of the RGE codes. We set Mef f (Q) = Mpole at scales where the effective mass\nexceeds the value of the pole mass.\nWe also take into account the SUSY-QCD corrections [22] to h, H, A \u2192 bb\u0304 vertices\n\nthat are important at large tan \u03b2. Here we use the effective Lagrangian\n\nLef f =\n\n\u221a\n\n\"\n\n!\n\ncos \u03b1\n\u2206mb tan \u03b1\n1\nmb\n\u2212Hbb\u0304\n1+\n4\u03c0\u03b1QED\n1 + \u2206mb 2MW sin \u03b8W\ncos \u03b2\ntan \u03b2\n!#\n!\n\u2206mb\n\u2206mb\n1\n+iAbb\u0304 tan \u03b2 1 \u2212\n1\u2212\n+ hbb\u0304\ntan \u03b2 2\ncos \u03b2\ntan \u03b1 tan \u03b2\n\n(2.12)\n\nwhere mb is the effective b-quark mass described above, \u03b1QED the electromagnetic coupling, tan \u03b2 is the ratio of the vev's of the Higgs doublets and \u03b1 is the Higgs mixing angle.\n\u2206mb is a correction factor arising from loop contribution of SUSY particles. This factor\nis particularly important at large tan \u03b2 and also contributes to b \u2192 s\u03b3 (all details are\n\ngiven in Appendix B).\n\nIn the large tan \u03b2 case, when neutralino annihilation via s-channel Higgs exchange\ndominates, the inclusion of SUSY-QCD corrections can shift by about 15% the value for\nthe relic density. There is an option to switch off this correction (see Section4.1).\nThe total width of the Higgs includes only the two-body final states that occur at\ntree-level. In the case of the light Higgs, this underestimates the width since the partial\n\n\fwidth to off-shell W or gg final states can reach 10%. However an accurate value for this\nvery narrow width has in general not a strong impact on the relic density. On the other\nhand a precise value for the heavy Higgs width is necessary.\n\n2.2\n\nNeutralino \"width\"\n\nWe assume that the LSP is stable because of R-parity conservation, however it is necessary\nto introduce a width for this stable particle in order to avoid infinities in some processes.\nFor example, in the coannihilation process like \u1ebdL \u03c701 \u2192 eX via t-channel exchange of \u03c701\nan infinity is caused by the pole in the propagator, this is due to the fact that one can\nhave a real decay \u1ebdL \u2192 e\u03c7\u030301 . We assign a value of sWidth * MLSP to the width of all\nsupersymmetric particles . The default value for the variable sWidth is 0.01.\n\n2.3\n\nLoop corrections to the MSSM spectrum.\n\nIn the mSUGRA model, but also in the more general MSSM, annihilation of the LSPs near\na Higgs or Z resonance and/or coannihilation processes are often the dominant reactions\nin models where \u03a9h2 \u2248 0.1 [23]. For an accurate calculation of the relic density it is then\nvery important to have the exact relations between particle masses. In particular, the\ndirect annihilation of a pair of neutralinos (\u03c7\u030301 ) depends sensitively on the mass difference\nwith the Higgs or Z, 2m\u03c7\u030301 \u2212 MH/Z , when the annihilation occurs near the resonance.\nFurthermore coannihilation processes depend strongly on the NLSP-LSP mass difference.\n\nIn this new version of micrOMEGAs1.3, we provide an option to calculate loop corrections to all sparticle masses 3 . Within the MSSM defined at the EWSB scale, loop\ncorrections are implemented by a call to Suspect[10], within the SUGRA or other model\ndefined at the GUT scale, the loop corrections are done by any of the four public codes\n(Suspect ,SOFTSUSY , Spheno ,Isajet ) for calculating the supersymmetric spectrum\nbased on renormalization group equations. Because it is a mass difference rather than\nthe absolute mass that has a large impact on the prediction of the relic density, even\nradiative corrections at the percent level, such as is often the case for neutralinos, need to\nbe taken into account. Indeed large shifts in the prediction of the relic density between\ntree-level and loop-corrected masses can be found. Typically the prediction for the relic\ndensity can change by 20%, but in some scenarios corrections can reach 100% or even\nmore. We not only use the loop-corrected sparticle masses but also the corresponding\nmixing matrix elements. In this way we take into account some of the loop corrections in\nthe evaluation of the matrix elements for different processes. This however means, since\n3\n\nPole masses in the calculation of the relic density were first used in Ref. [24]\n\n\fTable 1: Standard Model parameters\nname\nAlfEMZ\nAlfSMZ\nSW\nMZ\nMl\nMtp\nMbMb\n\ndefault\n0.00781653\n0.1172\n0.481\n91.1884\n1.777\n175.0\n4.23\n\ndefinition\nelectromagnetic coupling \u03b1em (MZ )\nstrong coupling, \u03b1sM S (MZ ) for nf = 5\nWeinberg angle, sin \u03b8W\nZ mass\ntau-lepton pole mass\nt-quark pole mass\nMS scale independent b-quark mass Mb(Mb)\n\nit is only a partial implementation of loop corrections, that theoretical inconsistencies in\nthe model could occur, in particular problems with unitarity violation in some processes.\nThis would mainly show up in processes with production of gauge particles, however at\nmuch higher energies that are typically involved in the LSP annihilation processes.\n\n3\n\nThe MSSM parameters.\n\nIn our package, we compute various matrix elements and cross-sections for 2 \u2192 2 processes within the framework of the MSSM. The model file corresponding to the specific\nimplementation of the MSSM was derived with LanHEP[25], a program that generates\nthe complete set of particles and vertices once given a Lagrangian [26, 27]. Names are\nattached to the parameters of the MSSM, including those of the SM, and their values can\nbe set with an instruction. For example, the command assignVal(\"Mtp\",180.) assigns\nthe value mt = 180GeV to the pole mass of the t-quark.\nThe list of parameters of the Standard Model and their default values is presented in\nTable 1. All quarks and leptons of the first two generations are assumed massless. The\ndefault values for the electromagnetic coupling and the Weinberg angle correspond to the\nvalues in the MS scheme at the MZ scale.\nThe parameters of the MSSM are described in Table 2. We follow the conventions\nof the SUSY Les Houches Accord [9]. The masses of the third generation fermions are\nordered, for example mt\u03031 corresponds to the lightest top-squark. In this list, the number\nof parameters exceeds the number of MSSM independent parameters. They correspond\nto physical parameters, masses and mixings. This extended set of parameters is however\nnecessary when one wants to use effective masses and vertices that include loop corrections.\nOur computation of matrix elements for cross-sections is based on this set of parameters.\nNote that the trilinear muon coupling, A\u03bc , is added to the parameter list even though\nit does not contribute to matrix elements or to the spectrum since the muon is assumed\n\n\fto be massless. This parameter is however important for evaluating the muon anomalous\nmagnetic moment.\nTable 2: MSSM parameters of the SUSY Les Houches Accord\nname\ntb\nalpha\nmu\nMh\nMH3\nMHH\nMHc\nAl\nAm\nAb\nAt\nMNEi\nMCi\nMSG\nMSne\nMSnm\n\ncomment\ntan \u03b2\nHiggs \u03b1 angle\nHiggs \u03bc parameter\nMass of light Higgs\nMass of CP-odd Higgs\nMass of Heavy Higgs\nMass of charged Higgs\n\u03c4\u0303 trilinear coupling\n\u03bc\u0303 trilinear coupling\nb\u0303 trilinear coupling\nt\u0303 trilinear coupling\ni=1,2,3,4; neutralino masses\ni=1,2 chargino masses\nmass of gluino\ne-sneutrino mass\n\u03bc-sneutrino mass\n\nname\nMSnl\nL\nMSe R\nL\nMSm R\nMSli\nL\nMSu R\nL\nMSs R\nMSti\nL\nMSd R\nL\nMSc R\nMSbi\nZnij\nZuij\nZvij\nZlij\nZtij\nZbij\n\ncomment\n\u03c4 -sneutrino mass\nmasses of left/right selectrons\nleft/right smuon masses\ni=1,2 masses of light/heavy \u03c4\u0303\nmasses of left/right u-squarks\nmasses of left/right s-squarks\ni=1,2 masses of light/heavy t-squarks\nmasses of left/right d-squarks\nmasses of left/right c-squarks\ni=1,2 masses of light/heavy b-squarks\ni,j=1,..,4; neutralino mixing matrix\ni=1,2;j=1,2; chargino U mixing matrix\ni=1,2;j=1,2; chargino V mixing matrix\ni=1,2;j=1,2; \u03c4\u0303 mixing matrix\ni=1,2;j=1,2; t\u0303 mixing matrix\ni=1,2;j=1,2; b\u0303 mixing matrix\n\nThe values of the SLHA parameters can either be set by an external program, here a\ncall to one of the RGE codes that calculate the supersymmetric spectrum, or by specifying\nthe MSSM parameters at the weak scale. In either case one needs to specify a set of\nindependent parameters as described below.\n\n3.1\n\nInput parameters at the GUT scale\n\nWithin the context of the SUGRA scenario for supersymmetry breaking the MSSM parameters can be evaluated at the weak scale starting from a set of scalar masses, gaugino\nmasses, trilinear couplings defined at the GUT scale. The GUT scale input parameters\nare listed in Table 3. Only one parameter, tan \u03b2, is defined at MZ . We implicitly assume that the first two generations are identical. The parameters for the mass of the\nHiggs doublet can be entered with a negative sign, in this case they will be understood\nas MH2 U = \u2212|MHU |2\nWe treat the mSUGRA model as a special case of the general SUGRA. Since simplifying relations are imposed on masses and couplings, in the mSUGRA model one has to specify only a small number of input parameters at the GUT scale: M0 , M1/2 , A0 , tan \u03b2, sgn(mu).\nThese correspond to\n\n\fm0 = Mli = Mri = Mqi = Mui = Mdi = MHu = MHd\n- common scalar mass at GUT scale;\nmhf= MG1 = MG2 = MG3 - common gaugino mass at GUT scale;\na0=At = Ab = Al - trilinear soft breaking parameter at GUT scale;\ntb- tan \u03b2 or the ratio of vacuum expectation values at MZ;\nsgn- +/-1, sign of \u03bc, the Higgsino mass term.\nFour different routines read the parameters of Table 2 and pass them to the corresponding packages that solves the RGE equations and calculate the MSSM masses and\nmixing matrices. The routines suspectSUGRA [10],softsusySUGRA [11], sphenoSUGRA [12],\nisajetSUGRA [13] are described in section4.1. Note that some of the standard parameters\nof Table 1 also play a role in the low energy boundary conditions implemented in the\nRGE codes. They are passed to RGE routines implicitly. We assume that the second\ngeneration is identical to the first one and only parameters of the first generation are used.\nTable 3: Independent GUT-scale parameters.\nname\ntb\nAt\nAb\nAl\nMG1\nMG2\nMG3\nsgn\nMHu\nMHd\n\n3.2\n\ncomment\ntan \u03b2 (at MZ )\nt\u0303 trilinear coupling\nb\u0303 trilinear coupling\n\u03c4\u0303 trilinear coupling\nU(1) Gaugino mass\nSU(2) Gaugino mass\nSU(3) Gaugino mass\nsign of \u03bc at the EWSB scale\nMass of first Higgs doublet\nMass of second Higgs doublet\n\nname\nMl1\nMl3\nMr1\nMr3\nMq1\nMq3\nMu1\nMu3\nMd1\nMd3\n\ncomment\nLeft-handed slepton mass for 1st /2nd gen.\nLeft-handed slepton mass for 3rd gen.\nRight-handed slepton mass for 1st /2nd gen.\nLeft-handed slepton mass for 3rd gen.\nLeft-handed squark mass for 1st /2nd gen.\nLeft-handed squark mass for 3rd gen.\nRight-handed u-squark mass for 1st /2nd gen.\nRight-handed u-squark mass for 3rd gen.\nRight-handed d-squark mass for 1st /2nd gen.\nRight-handed d-squark mass for 3rd gen.\n\nInput parameters at the weak scale\n\nThe parameters of the SUSY Les Houches Accord can also be calculated starting from\nthe set of independent MSSM parameters at the EWSB scale4 listed in Table 3[26]. This\ncan be done either at tree-level or with loop corrections (see Section 4.1). The names of\nthe independent parameters of the MSSM are identical to the GUT scale parameters safe\nfor MHu,MHd which are conveniently replaced by \u03bc and MA (MH3). Furthermore at the\nEWSB scale one must define the sfermion masses for all three generations. Here MH3 and\nMG3 are the pole masses of the CP-odd Higgs and of the gluino. All other parameters\n4\n\nThis set of parameters was used in the previous version of micrOMEGAs[6].\n\n\fare treated as running ones.

The types of the functions and\ntheir arguments are specified in Appendix A. Examples of implementation are presented\nin Section 5.4.

The Higgs\n\nsector parameters, masses and mixing angle \u03b1, are calculated with FeynHiggsFast [15].\nLCOn=0 - tree level formulae for super particles masses;\nLCOn=1 - Suspect is used to evaluate loop corrections to masses of super particles.\n\u2022ewsbInitFile(filename,LCOn)\n\n\freads the input file filename which specifies the set of independent MSSM parameters\nat the EWSB scale and calculates the supersymmetric spectrum at tree-level or one-loop\nas set by the parameter LCOn (same as above).\nThe function returns:\n0 - when the input has been read correctly;\n-1 - if the file does not exist or can not be opened for reading;\n-2 - if some parameter from Table 4 is missing as displayed on the sceen;\n-3 - if the spectrum cannot be calculated;\nn - when the line number n has been written in the wrong format.\nFor example, the correct format of a line is\nMG3 1500.\n\n\u2022readLesH(filename,LE)\nreads the input file in the SUSY Les Houches Accord format [9]. If LE=1 the SM parameters\nof Table 1 as well as tan \u03b2 are also read from a SLHA output file.\n\u2022calcDep(dMbOn)\n\ninitializes internal parameters for subsequent calculations. In particular, the running\nmasses of quarks, the strong coupling constant as well as the widths of gauge bosons,\nHiggses and superparticles. Running parameters are evaluated at the LSP scale. This\nroutine also sorts the superparticles and selects the LSP. The parameter dMbOn= 0 switches\noff SUSY-QCD corrections, \u2206mb , see Section 2.1.\n\n4.2\n\nDisplay of parameters.\n\n\u2022findVal(name,&val) [findVal(name,val) ]\n\nassigns to the variable val the value of the parameter name. It returns zero if such variable\nindeed exists and 1 otherwise. This function can be applied to any of the parameters in\nTable 1,2 as well as to particle masses and widths specified in Tables 5,6,7.\n\u2022findValW(name)\n\nreturns the value corresponding to the variable name. If name is not defined findValW\nwrites a warning on the screen.\n\u2022printVar(file,N) [ printVar(N) ]\nprints the first N records of the full list of model parameters. The first 7 parameters\ncorrespond to Table 1, the following 75 parameters correspond to the list in Table 2. To\nsee the parameters on the screen, substitute file=stdout. In the Fortran version, only\ndisplay on the sceen is possible.\n\u2022printMasses(file,sort) [ printMasses(sort) ]\n\n\fprints into the file the masses of the supersymmetric particles as well as all Higgs masses\nand widths. The Fortran version writes down on the screen. If sort6= 0, the masses are\nsorted in increasing order.\n\u2022lsp() [ lsp(name) ]\n\nreturns the name of the LSP. The relic density can be calculated with any particle being\nthe LSP even though only the neutralino and the sneutrino can be dark matter candidates.\nIf the user wants to impose a specific LSP, the nature of the LSP must be checked after\ncalling calcDep.\n\u2022lspmass_() [ lspmass() ]\nreturns the mass of the lightest supersymmetric particle in GeV .\n\n4.3\n\nCalculation of relic density.\n\n\u2022darkOmega(&Xf,fast,Beps) [ darkOmega(Xf,Fast,Beps) ]\n\nThis is the basic function of the package which returns the relic density \u03a9h2 (Eq. 2.3).\nThe procedure for solving the evolution equation using Runge-Kutta was described in\nSection 2. The value of the freeze-out parameter Xf is returned by the function and\nequals (Xf1 + Xf2 )/2, (see the definition in Eq. 2.7, 2.8). The parameter Beps defines the\ncriteria for including a given channel into the sum for the calculation of the thermally\naveraged cross-section, Eq. 2.10; 10\u22126 is the recommended value.\nIf fast=0, we use an integration routine that increases the number of points until\nan accuracy of 10\u22123 is reached. If fast=1 the accuracy is not checked, but a set of\npoints is chosen according to the behaviour of the integrand: poles, thresholds, Boltzman\nsuppression at large energy. The accuracy of this mode is about 1%. Finally, fast=2\ncorresponds to the calculation of relic density using the widely-used approximation [5]\nbased on the expansion in terms of velocity\np * \u03c3(p) = A + B * p2 .\nThe recommended mode is fast=1.\nIf some problem is encountered, darkOmega returns (\u22121).\n\u2022darkOmegaFO(&Xf,fast,Beps) [ darkOmegaFO(Xf,fast,Beps) ]\n\ncalculates the relic density as the function darkOmega described above, but using the\nfreeze-out approximation.\n\u2022printChannels(Xf,cut,Beps,prcnt,f) [ printChannels(Xf,cut,Beps,prcnt) ]\nprints the relative contribution to \u03a9\u22121 for all subprocesses for which this contribution\nexceeds the value chosen for cut. If prcnt=1 the contribution is given in percent, otherwise\n\n\fthe absolute value is displayed. It is assumed that the Xf parameter was first evaluated\nby darkOmega. In the C version, the output is directed to the file f, the Fortran version\nwrites on the screen. Actually this routine evaluates the partial contributions to the\nintegral of Eq. 2.9 without the 1/Yf term and returns the corresponding value for \u03a9h2 .\n\n4.4\n\nRoutines for constraints.\n\n\u2022deltarho_() [ delrho()]\n\ncalculates, by a call to a Suspect routine, the \u2206\u03c1 parameter which describes the MSSM\ncorrections to electroweak observables. It contains stop/sbottom contributions, as well\nas the two-loop QCD corrections due to gluon exchange and the correction due to gluino\nexchange in the heavy gluino limit [28]. Precise measurements of SM electroweak observables allow to set the limit \u2206\u03c1 < 2 * 10\u22123.\n\u2022bsgnlo_() [ bsgnlo() ]\n\nreturns the value of the branching ratio for b \u2192 s\u03b3. For b \u2192 s\u03b3 we have improved on the\nresults of [29] by including some very recent new contributions beyond the leading order\nthat are especially important for high tan \u03b2. Full details can be found in Appendix B.\n\u2022bsmumu_() [ bsmumu() ]\n\nreturns the MSSM contribution to Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 . Our calculation is based on [30] and\nagrees with [33]. It includes the loop contributions due to chargino, sneutrino, stop and\nHiggs exchange. The \u2206mb effect relevant for high tan \u03b2 is taken into account. The current\nbound from CDF experiment at Fermilab is B.R.(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 < 9 \u00d7 10\u22126) [31] and the\nexpected bound from RunIIa should reach B.R.(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 < 2 \u00d7 10\u22127 ) [32].\n\u2022gmuon_() [ gmuon() ]\nreturns the value of the supersymmetric contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment\nof the muon [34]. The result depends only on the parameters of the chargino/neutralino\nsector as well as on the smuon parameters, in particular the trilinear coupling A\u03bc (Am).\nOur formulas agree with [35]. The latest experimental data on the (g \u2212 2)\u03bc measurement\nusing \u03bc\u2212 [36], brings the average to aexp.\n= 11659208 \u00b1 6 \u00d7 10\u221210 . The quantity a\u03bc includes\n\u03bc\n\nboth electroweak and hadronic contributions and is still subject to large theoretical errors,\nthe allowed range for \u03b4a\u03bc = aexp.\n\u2212 atheo.\nthen has also large errors. We estimate the 3\u03c3\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\nrange to be 5.1 < \u03b4a\u03bc \u00d7 1010 < 64.1 [37].\n\u2022masslimits_() [ masslimits() ]\n\nreturns a positive value and prints a WARNING when the choice of parameters conflicts\nwith a direct accelerator limits on sparticle masses. The constraint on the light Higgs\nmass is not implemented and must be added by the user.\n\n\fAmong the routines that calculate constraints, only masslimits issues a warning if the\nchosen model gives a value outside the experimentally allowed range. All other constraints\nmust be checked by the user.\n\n4.5\n\nQCD auxiliary routines.\n\n\u2022 alphaQCD(Q)\ncalculates the running \u03b1s at the scale Q in the MS scheme. The calculation is done using\nthe NNLO formula in [20]. Thresholds for b-quark and t-quark are included in nf at the\nscales mb (mb ) and mt (mt ) respectively. Implicit input parameters are AlfSMZ, Mtp, and\nMbMb defined in Table 1.\n\u2022 MbRun(Q), MtRun(Q)\n\ncalculates top and bottom running masses evaluated at NNLO.\n\u2022 MbEff(Q), MtEff(Q)\n\ncalculates effective t- and b-quark masses as in Eq. 2.11.\n\u2022deltaMb()\n\ncalculates the SUSY corrections to \u2206mb (Appendix B).\n\n4.6\n\nPartial widths and cross sections\n\n\u2022 decay2(pName,k, out1, out2)\ncalculates the decay widths (in GeV) for any 1 \u2192 2 processes. The input parameters are\n\npName, the name of the decaying particle and k, the channel number. out1 and out2 are\nthe names of outgoing particles for channel k. If k exceeds the total number of channels,\nthen out1 and out2 are filled as empty strings.\n\n\u2022 newProcess(procName, libName) [ newProcess(procName, libName, address) ]\n\nprepares and compiles the codes for any 2 \u2192 2 reaction in the MSSM. The result of the\ncompilation is stored in the library\n\nsource/2-2/libName.os.\nIf this library already exists, it is not recompiled and the correspondence between the contents of the library and the procName parameter is not checked. libName is also attached\nto the names of routines in the libName.so library. Therefore libName should not contain\nsymbols such as +, \u2212, \u2217, /, which are not legal as identifiers. Library names should not\nstart with omglib, these are reserved for the libraries used to evaluate \u03a9h2 .\nThe process should be specified in CalcHEP notations, for example\n\"e,E->~1+,~1-\"\n\n\fTable 5: Higgs particles.\nName\nsymbol\nLight Higgs h\nHeavy higgs H\n\nmass\nMh\nMHH\n\nwidth\nwh\nwHh\n\nName\nsymbol\nCP-odd Higgs H3\nCharged Higgs H+,H-\n\nmass\nMH3\nMHc\n\nwidth\nwH3\nwHc\n\nwithout any blank space. One can find all symbols for MSSM particles in Tables 5,6,7.\nMulti-process generation is also possible using the command\n\"e,E->2*x\"\nwhere x means arbitrary final states.\nThe newProcess routine returns the address of the static structure with contains, for\nfurther use, the code for the processes. If the process can not be compiled, then a NULL\naddress is returned (address[1]=0 in Fortran). newProcess can also return the address\nof a library that was already generated, for example, newProcess(\"\",\"omglib_o1_o1\")\nreturns the address of the library for neutralino annihilation.\n\u2022infor22(address,nsub,n1,n2,n3,n4,&m1,&m2,&m3,&m4)\n\n[ infor22(address,nsub,n1,n2,n3,n4,m1,m2,m3,m4) ]\nallows to check the contents of the library produced by newProcess. Here address is\nthe returned value of newProcess call and nsub the subprocess number. The parameters\nreturned correspond to the names of particles for a given subprocess (n1, n2, n3, n4) as\nwell as their masses (m1, m2, m3, m4). The function returns 2 if the nsub parameters\nexceed the limits and 0 otherwise.\n\u2022 cs22(address, nsub, P, c1, c2 , &err)\nevaluates the cross section for a given 2 \u2192 2 process with center of mass momentum\n\nP (GeV). The differential cross section is integrated from c1 < cos(\u03b8) < c2 and \u03b8 is the\nangle between p\u03041 , p\u03043 in the center-of-mass frame. If nsub exceeds the maximum value for\nthe number of subprocesses then err contains a non zero error code.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nWork with the micrOMEGAs package.\nInstallation and link with RGE packages.\n\nmicrOMEGAs can be obtained at\nhttp://wwwlapp.in2p3.fr/lapth/micromegas\nThe name of the file downlaoded should be micromegas 1.3.0.tar.gz. After unpacking\nthe file, the root directory of the package, micromegas_1.3.0, will be created.

To compile, type either\n./micro_make\nThis command is a Unix script, which detects the operating system and its version,\nsets the corresponding compiler options, and compiles the code. Being launched without\narguments, micro_make compiles only auxiliary libraries needed for relic density evaluation. Otherwise, the first argument is treated as a C or Fortran main program which\nshould be compiled and linked with these libraries. The executable file created has the\nsame name as the main program without the .c/.f extension.\nIt is interesting to investigate the relic density in the framework of some scenario of\nsupersymmetry breaking. We rely on the public codes that evaluate the supersymmetric\nspectrum in the context of models defined at the GUT scale such as the mSUGRA model.\n\n\fOne of these packages, Suspect [10], is included into the micrOMEGAs package. We also\nsupport an interface with SOFTSUSY [11], Spheno [12] and Isajet [13].\nTo use Isajet, the corresponding library should be attached to the code. It can be\ndone via the variable EXTLIB to be defined in the micro_make file. For example, to use\nIsajet located in the ~/isajet769 directory the definition should be\nEXTLIB=\"$HOME/isajet769/libisajet.a\"\nIf mathlib from CERNLIB is not included in libisajet.a it should be specified in EXTLIB,\nfor example\nEXTLIB=\"$HOME/isajet769/libisajet.a -L/cern/pro/lib -lmathlib\"\nThe interface with SOFTSUSY and Spheno is realized in the framework of the SUSY\nLes Houches accord[9] by direct execution of the corresponding programs. In both cases,\nthe user has to define in the micro_make file, the variables SOFTSUSY or SPHENO which\nidentifies the directory where the corresponding executable file is located. For example,\nSOFTSUSY=$HOME/softsusy_1.8\nor\nSPHENO=$HOME/SPheno2.2.0\nTo install the package, one needs initially about 20MB of disk space. As the program generates libraries for annihilation processes only at the time they are required, the\ntotal disk space necessary can double after running the program for different models as\ndescribed in the next section.\n\n5.2\n\nDynamic generation of matrix elements and their loading.\n\nIn order to take into account all possible processes of annihilation of superparticles into\nSM particles, we need matrix elements for about 2800 different subprocesses. However,\nfor a given set of parameters, usually only a few processes contribute, other subprocesses\nare suppressed by the Boltzmann factor.\nThe micrOMEGAs package just after compilation does not contain the code for matrix\nelements. They are generated and linked in runtime when needed. To generate the\nmatrix elements we use the CalcHEP program [16] in batch mode [38]. The compiled\nmatrix elements are stored as shared libraries in the subdirectory\nsources/2-2/\nThe name of the library created corresponds to the names of initial superparticles. Say,\nthe library containing \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 annihilation processes is omglib_o1_o1.so.\nOn the first few calls, micrOMEGAs works slowly because it compiles matrix elements.\nAfter being compiled once, the code for matrix elements is stored on the disk and is\n\n\faccessible for all subsequent calls. Each process is generated and compiled only once.\nIn case several jobs are submitted simultaneously, a problem occurs when CalcHEP\nreceives a new request to generate a matrix element when it has not completed the previous\none. We delay the operation of the second program. The warning that CalcHEP is busy\nsignals the presence of a LOCK file in the directory\nsources/work/tmp\nIf for some reason this file is not removed after the CalcHEP session, the user should\nremove it.\nThe executable file generated by micro_make can be moved and executed in other\ndirectories. However it will always use and update the matrix elements stored in\nmicromegas_1.3.0/sources/2-2\n\n5.3\n\nLinking with other codes and including micrOMEGAs into\nother packages.\n\nOne can easily add other libraries to the micrOMEGAs package similarly to the implementation of Isajet described in Section 5.1. One needs to pass the library name to\nthe linker via the EXTLIB variable defined in micro_make, by specifying the complete\npath to the library. One can include the micrOMEGAs package into other C, C++, or\nFortran projects. The function prototypes for C and C++ projects are stored in the\nsources/micromegas.h file. All the routines of our package as well as Suspect and\nFeynHiggsFast routines are stored in\nsources/micromegas.a\nwhich in turn needs the functions of\nsources/decay2.a\nto calculate the widths. The user must pass to the linker the library that supports dynamic loading. The name of this library depends on the Unix platform. One can find this\nname in the micro_make file, it is assigned to the LDDL environment variable.\nTo attach micrOMEGAs to a C or C++ project, the user should make sure that the\nlibrary of Fortran functions are also passed to the linker. In the micro_make file this\nlibrary is described by the LDF variable.\n\n5.4\n\nRunning micrOMEGAs1.3: examples.\n\nThe directory micromegas_1.3.0 contains several examples of main programs. The files\nsugomg.c and sugomg_f.f are main programs for the evaluation of the relic density in\nthe mSUGRA scenario.\n\n\f./micro_make sugomg.c\ngenerates the executable sugomg which needs 5 parameters\n./sugomg <m0> <mhf> <a0> <tb> <sgn>\nThe sugomg executable also understands three additional input parameters as mt , mb (mb ),\n\u03b1s (MZ ). The output contains the SUSY and Higgs mass spectrum, the value of the relic\ndensity, the relative contributions of different processes to 1/\u03a9 as well as the constraints\nmentioned in Section 4.4. The list of necessary parameters are written on the screen when\nsugomg is called without specifying parameters.\n./micro_make sugomg_f.f\ncompiles the corresponding Fortran code. In this case the input parameters are requested\nafter launching the program:\n> ./sugomg_f\nEnter m0\nmhf a0\n\ntb\n\nsgn\n\n>\nBy default these programs call Suspect for solving the RGE equations. One can easily\nchange the RGE code by replacing the suspectSUGRA call by the appropriate one in\nsugomg.c or sugomg_f.f.\nThe program s_cycle.c performs the calculation over 10 mSUGRA test points [39].\nResults for these points for all RGE programs mentioned in our paper are presented in\nthe file data/s_cycle.res.\nFinally the omg.c and omg_f.f programs evaluated the relic density in the case of\nthe unconstrained MSSM. The input parameters are read from a text file written in the\nformat of the ewsbInitFile routine. In the C-version the file should be passed as a\nparameter, for example\n./omg data/data03\nIf several sets of parameters are passed to the program, the calculation will be done in\na cycle. The Fortran version also works in a cycle, waiting for a file name as input and\nfinishes after an empty line input.\nThe directory data contains 22 \"data*\" test input files for this routine. These parameter sets were chosen to check the program in special difficult cases where either strong\nco-annihilation and/or Higgs pole contribute significantly in relic density evaluation. Results of relic density calculation for all these 22 test points using the option when all\nmasses are evaluated at tree-level are stored in file data\\omg.res.\n\n\f5.5\n\nCalcHEP interactive session.\n\nThe CalcHEP [16] program used for matrix element generation is included in the micrOMEGAs\npackage. The user can calculate interactively various cross sections both in the general\nMSSM and in SUGRA models. To realize this option the user has to move to the calchep\nsubdirectory and launch\n./calchep\nThe implementation of the MSSM and SUGRA models in CalcHEP is identical to the\none in micrOMEGAs described in previous sections. There are two auxiliary parameters,\nLCOn and dMbOn which switch ON/OFF loop corrections to the MSSM particle spectrum\nand SUSY-QCD correction to h, H, A \u2192 bb\u0304 decays respectively. If LCOn>0 or dMbOn>0 the\ncorresponding correction is taken into account.\nThe list of parameters contains also the scale parameter Q which should be set depending of the scale of the process under consideration. This parameter contributes to\nthe running of \u03b1s and to the running masses of t and b quarks. Here we use the standard MS formulae without including the higher order QCD corrections 5 presented in\nSection 2.1.\nFor the SUGRA model, all four RGE packages presented in micrOMEGAs can be used,\nSuspect is defined by default. External RGE packages are available for CalcHEP if they\nwere already properly installed in the micrOMEGAs package as described in section 5.1.\nTo include another RGE package one has to edit the model in CalcHEP (in the Edit\nmodel menu). The suspectSUGRA call should be commented in the Constraints menu\nwhile the line corresponding to the call for another routine should be uncommented.\nThe symbol for comment is %. In the Edit model menu one can also defined the nonuniversal SUGRA model. By default, mSUGRA boundary conditions are implemented.\nTo modify this, first comment the lines in the Constraints menu which express the GUT\nscale parameters in Table 3 in terms of the mSUGRA parameters.

Loop corrections\nto the masses of Higgs particles and to the partial widths of the Higgs (QCD and SUSY)\nare implemented. These higher-order corrections are essential since the annihilation crosssection can be very sensitive to the mass of the particles that contribute to the various\nannihilation processes, in particular near a resonance or in regions of parameter space\nwhere coannihilations occur. Furthermore, both these processes are often the dominant\nones in physically interesting supersymmetric models, that is in models where the relic\ndensity is below the WMAP upper limit.\n\n\fThe relic density can be calculated starting from a set of MSSM parameters defined at\nthe weak scale or at the GUT scale. We provide an interface to the four major codes that\ncalculate the supersymmetric spectrum using renormalization group equations. Within\nthe context of the mSUGRA model, there are still large uncertainties in the computation\nof the supersymmetric spectrum [42], this of course will have a strong impact on the\nprediction for the relic density [14]. An accurate prediction of the relic density within\nSUGRA models then presupposes a precise knowledge of the supersymmetric spectrum.\nNew features of the package also include the computation of cross-sections and decay\nwidths for any process in the MSSM with two-body final states as well as an improved\nNLO calculation of the b \u2192 s\u03b3 branching ratio and a new routine for the Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212\ndecay rate.\n\n8\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank A.

Most of what is described below, as implemented in micrOMEGAs, is\nin fact just a, unified, compendium of different contributions that have appeared in the\nliterature. There is no claim of originality, most expressions are taken verbatim. However\ncare has been taken in carefully checking all formulae that have appeared in the literature.\n\nThis has helped, for example, identify a few misprints and typos and allowed to generalise\nsome results. By giving the detail of the implementation, it is possible to easily modify\nthis routine of the micrOMEGAs code in order to include future new contributions both to\nthe SM and the MSSM. Note that we redefine in this routine many parameters used in\nmicrOMEGAs1.3, for example the running quark masses, this routine can then be used as\na stand-alone routine.\n\n\fB.1\n\nGeneral set-up: From MW to \u03bcb , QED corrections\n\nOur implementation of the Standard Model contribution follows the work of Kagan and\nNeubert [43] very closely. We however include the effect of a running c quark mass\nheuristically so that our results take into account the latest calculations of Gambino and\nMisiak[44] who advocate the use of the MS charm mass, mc (mb ).

B.14) is of order mb and is usually let to vary in\nthe range (mb /2, 2mb ). The default value in the code is mb . Varying \u03bcb is one measure of\nthe theoretical error.

For the radiative photon we take \u03b1 = 1/137.036.\nThe factor KNLO (\u03b4) involves the photon energy cut-off parameter \u03b4 that shows up at\nthe NLO. In micrOMEGAs this value is set to \u03b4 = 0.9 as is generally assumed in order to\ndescribe the \"total\" (fake) branching ratio.

These can be very useful if one wants to introduce the effects of New Physics\nthrough the Wilson coefficients defined at the scale MW . Dismissing any right-handed\nlight quark operator and assuming purely real contributions, the New Physics contribution\ncan be written as\n(0,1)\n\n(0,1),SM\n\nC7,8 = x7,8 C7,8\n\n(MW )\n\n(B.43)\n\nthen the Bij are the coefficients of the different xi factors (linear and quadratic, and a xi\nindependent term). In other words, the contribution of the New Physics can be expressed\nas\nN LO\nBs\u03b3\n= B22 + B27 x7 + B28 x8 + B77 x27 + B88 x28 + B78 x7 x8\n\n(B.44)\n\n\fNote the assumption in [43] that the proportionality factor is the same for the LO and\nNLO.

Most importantly, the sign of the Yukawa contribution and the elements of the\ndiagonalising matrices that appear in Eq. B.67 are different from those in [45]. We have\nverified this by explicit calculation of \u01eb\u2032b (t), moreover with our formula, we find that in\nthe decoupling limit we do indeed have \u01eb\u2032b (t) \u2192 \u01ebb , which would not have been the case\nhad we blindly used the formula of [45]. One of the authors of [45], Paolo Gambino, has\nrecently confirmed our implementation.\n\n\fAs for \u01eb\u2032t (s), we find that only the QCD contribution remains.

Therefore in our numerical analysis that takes this\nresummation into account we only keep the tan \u03b2 enhanced terms.\nAs we mentioned earlier these \u01eb's contributions are to be evaluated at the scale Q2 =\n\u03bc2susy > m2t which we associate with the gluino mass.

B.20.\nTo check on the SUSY part and the implementation of tan \u03b2 enhanced terms, we have\nfirst verified that we had perfect agreement with Fig. 4 of [45]. This in fact is only a check\non the implementation of the \u01eb's in the SM and H + contribution with fixed \u01eb. A full check\nof the SUSY contribution requires a quite large set of inputs. In [45] one can read the\neffect on B \u2192 Xs \u03b3 of a SUGRA model. Since the outputs of SUGRA codes can differ\nquite a bit, we have not used our own RGE but requested the weak scale parameters from\nPaolo Gambino used for their Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 in [45] , which in passing includes only\nthe \u03b1s contribution to the \u01eb. We have found an excellent agreement both for positive and\nnegative \u03bc.\n\nReferences\n[1] The WMAP Collaboration, C. L. Bennett et al., [arXiv:astro-ph/0302207] and\nD. N.
