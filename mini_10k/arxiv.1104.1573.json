Program Summary\nProgram title: SPheno\nProgram Obtainable from: http://projects.hepforge.org/spheno/\nProgramming language: F95\nComputers for which the program has been designed: PC running under Linux, should run in\nevery Unix environment\nOperating systems: Linux, Unix\nKeywords: Supersymmetry, renormalization group equations, mass spectra of supersymmetric models,\nRunge-Kutta, decays of supersymmetric particles, production\nNature of problem: The first issue is the determination of the masses and couplings of supersymmetric\nparticles in various supersymmetric models the R-parity conserved MSSM with generation mixing and\nincluding CP-violating phases, various seesaw extensions of the MSSM and the MSSM with bilinear Rparity breaking. Low energy data on Standard Model fermion masses, gauge couplings and electroweak\ngauge boson masses serve as constraints. Radiative corrections from supersymmetric particles to these\ninputs must be calculated. Theoretical constraints on the soft SUSY breaking parameters from a high\nscale theory are imposed and the parameters at the electroweak scale are obtained from the high scale\nparameters by evaluating the corresponding renormalization group equations. These parameters must\nbe consistent with the requirement of correct electroweak symmetry breaking. The second issue is to use\nthe obtained masses and couplings for calculating decay widths and branching ratios of supersymmetric\nparticles as well as the cross sections for theses particles in electron positron annihilation. The third issue\nis to calculate low energy constraints in the B-meson sector such as BR(b \u2192 s\u03b3), \u2206MBs , rare lepton\ndecays, such as BR(\u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3), the SUSY contributions to anomalous magnetic moments and electric dipole\nmoments of leptons, the SUSY contributions to the rho parameter as well as lepton flavour violating Z\ndecays.\nSolution method: The renormalization connecting a high scale and the electroweak scale is calculated\nby the Runge-Kutta method.

Introduction\nIn its orginal version SPheno had been designed to calculate the spectrum in the MSSM neglecting\nany effects due to generation mixing and/or CP violation [1]. Moreover, the two- and three-body decays\nof the SUSY particles as well as of the Higgs bosons can be calculated as well as the production rates of\nthese particles in e+ e\u2212 annihilation. The code itself is written in FORTRAN 95.\nThe program has been extended to include flavour aspects, CP-violation and R-parity violation.\nMoreover, different variants of the seesaw mechanism have been implemented. In this paper we describe\nthe corresponding changes and implementations. Details on the algorithms used can be found in the\norginal manual [1]. Moreover, we give in the appendices the default values for various flags as well as the\nerror coding.\n3. Extensions with MSSM particle content at the electroweak scale and conserved R-parity\nSPheno has been extended to include flavour and CP violating phases using the SLHA2 conventions\n[2] for the general MSSM. For this purpose the complete flavour structures including CP-phases have\nbeen implemented in the RGEs at the 2-loop level using the formulas given in [3]. We have extended the\nformulas of [4] for the 1-loop masses to account for the flavour structures, e.g. we calculate the 1-loop\ncorrected 6 \u00d7 6 mass matrices for squarks and charged leptons and the 1-loop corrected 3 \u00d7 3 mass matrix\nfor sneutrinos [5, 6]. Moreover, we take into account all possible phases in the calculation of all mass\nmatrices at the 1-loop level but for one exception: we do not consider the loop induced mixing between\nthe scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs bosons.\nBeside the calculation of the spectrum also the decay routines have been extended to calculate all\npossible two- and three body decays of supersymmetric particles and Higgs bosons at leading order\nincluding flavour effects. In addition the set of low energy observables has been extended as described in\nsection 5.\nWithin the MSSM several model classes are implemented\n\u2022 High scale models like mSUGRA, GMSB, AMSB\n\u2022 A SUGRA scenario where all soft SUSY breaking parameters are given freely at the GUT scale\nwhich is determined usually via the condition g1 (MGUT ) = g2 (MGUT ). However, this scale can be\nset to a fixed value using entry 31 in block SPhenoInput, see section 6.2.5.\n\u2022 All MSSM parameters specified at the electroweak scale QEW SB with a user specified value for\nQEW SB .\nIn all cases it is assumed that the required input is given via the SLHA convention [7, 2].\nIn addition several classes of neutrino mass models have been included with additional states at high\nenergy scales:\n\u2022 A seesaw I model with different masses for the right-handed neutrinos. The corresponding particle\ncontent can be chosen setting the entry 3 of the block MODSEL as described in section 6.1.2. The\nparameters are set using the blocks MNURIN and YNU0IN, see sections 6.2.2 and 6.2.7, respectively.\nUsing this the results of [8, 9] have been obtained.\n\u2022 Two variants of seesaw II model have been implemented. Here one can either choose a pair of\nSU (2) triplets or a pair of SU (5) 15-plets to generate neutrino masses. The first version uses the\nformulas [10] including the corrections presented in [11] and 2-loop RGEs for the gauge couplings\nand gaugino mass parameters as used in [12]. Here the blocks Higgs3IN and YT0IN have to be used\nto transfer the data, see sections 6.2.1 and 6.2.8. This variant is faster if one uses 2-loop RGEs but\nless accurate in particular for low seesaw scales [13].\nIn case of a pair of SU (5) 15-plets a second variant has been implemented using the complete 2-loop\nRGEs and corresponding threshold corrections at the seesaw scale as described in [14]. Here the\nblocks Higgs3IN and YTIN have to be used to transfer the data, see sections 6.2.1 and 6.2.9.\n2\n\n\f\u2022 A seesaw III model with three SU (5) matter 24-plets using the complete 2-loop RGEs and corresponding threshold corrections at the seesaw scales as described in [13]. The blocks MWMIN and\nYB3IN can be used to set the parameters, see sections 6.2.3 and 6.2.6.\n\u2022 A minimal SU (5) model as described in [15]. The corresponding particle content can be chosen\nsetting the entry 3 of the block MODSEL as described in section 6.1.2. The parameters are set using\nthe blocks MNURIN and YNU0IN, see sections 6.2.2 and 6.2.7, respectively. The additional SU (5)\nparameters can be set extending the block MINPAR as described in section 6.1.1.\nNote, that in these models the particle content at the electroweak scale is the same as in the usual MSSM\nand that the differences are only due to the modified evaluation of the parameters.\n4. R-parity violation\nCurrently the bilinear model is implemented, i.e. extending the superpotential by the terms\nb b\nWR\n/ = \u01eb i L i Hu\n\n(1)\n\nand the corresponding soft SUSY breaking terms. In this class of models neutrino physics can be explaining due to the mixing of neutralinos with neutrinos and by loop contributions. The corresponding\ndetails can be found in [16, 17]. The same parameters giving rise to neutrino masses also lead to the\ndecay of the LSP and, thus, there are correlations between the LSP decay properties and neutrino physics\n[18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23].\nHere one has two options\n\u2022 use within SLHA2 the blocks EXTPAR, RVSNVEVIN and RVKAPPAIN to specify the model parameters\nat the electroweak scale\n\u2022 use one of the high scale models mSUGRA, GMSB or AMSB to calculate the R-parity conserving\nparameters at the electroweak scale. The R-parity parameters are then added at this scale using\none of the two possiblities\n\u2013 add them using the blocks RVSNVEVIN and RVKAPPAIN\n\u2013 use the flag 91 of the block SPhenoInput as described in section 6.2.5 to calculate the \u01ebi and\nthe sneutrino vacuum expectations values vi such, that neutrino physics is respected. The\ncorresponding neutrino data can be specified in block NeutrinoBoundsIn, see section 6.2.4.\nIn this class of models the mass matrices are calculated at tree-level except for the neutrino/neutralino\nmass matrix which requires the inclusion of the full 1-loop contributions. Moreover, all possible R-parity\nviolating decay modes are calculated.\n5. Low energy observables\nIn this section we summarize the main references from which the formulas for the corresponding\nimplementation have been taken. Moreover we give implementation specific details whenever necessary.\nFor the moment the low energy observables are only calculated if there is an effective MSSM at the\nelectroweak scale and conserved R-parity.\n5.1. B-physics observables\nare calculated in SPheno: BR(b \u2192 s\u03b3), BR(b \u2192 s\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ), BR(b \u2192\nPThe following 0observables\n+ \u2212\ns i \u03bdi \u03bdi ), BR(Bd \u2192 \u03bc \u03bc ), BR(Bs0 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ), BR(Bu \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd), \u2206MBs0 and \u2206MBd0 . For the calculation of the Wilson coefficients we use running couplings and SUSY masses which are in general\nevolved at the scale Q = mZ . The only exception is BR(b \u2192 s\u03b3) as we use here the formula of ref. [24]\nwhere the corresponding coefficients have to be given at the scale Q = 160 GeV. For the calculation of\nthe Wilson coefficients and the corresponding observables we have used\n3\n\n\fTable 1: Parameters used in the calculation of the B-physics observables.\n\n\u03c4B 0 = 1.525 ps\nfB = 190 MeV\nMB 0 = 5.2795 GeV\n\n\u03c4Bs0 = 1.472 ps\nBBd = 1.22\nMBs0 = 5.3663 GeV\n\n\u03c4Bu+ = 1.638 ps\nfBs = 230 MeV\n\u03b7B = 0.55\n\n\u03c4Bc+ = 0.45 ps\nBBs = 1.26\n\n\u2022 BR(b \u2192 s\u03b3) [25, 26, 24]; the value given is for E\u03b3 \u2265 1.6 GeV and mc /mb = 0.23.\n\u2022 BR(b \u2192 s\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) [25, 26, 27]\nP\n\u2022 BR(b \u2192 s i \u03bdi \u03bdi ) [26, 25]\n\n\u2022 BR(Bs0 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ), BR(Bd0 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) [28, 26, 29]\n\u2022 BR(Bu \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd) [30]\n\u2022 \u2206MBs0 and \u2206MBd0 [26, 29]. For the hadronic parameters we follow [29]:\nP\u03041LR = \u22120.71 , P\u03042LR = \u22120.9 , P\u03041SLL = \u22120.37 , P\u03041SLL = \u22120.72 .\n\nThe remaining parameters used are given in table 1.\n5.2. Lepton sector\nIn the leptonic sector a similar strategy is used: all parameters are evolved to mZ and then running\nmasses and mixing matrices are used as input for the observables. The implemented formulas are based\non\n\u2022 SUSY contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the leptons [31]\n\u2022 electric dipole moments (EDMs) of the leptons [32, 33]\n\u2022 two body decays \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3, \u03c4 \u2192 e\u03b3 and \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 [34, 33]\n\u2022 three body decays \u03bc \u2192 ee+ e\u2212 , \u03c4 \u2192 ee+ e\u2212 and \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 [35]\n\u2022 Z decays, Z \u2192 e\u00b1 \u03bc\u2213 , Z \u2192 e\u00b1 \u03c4 \u2213 and Z \u2192 \u03bc\u00b1 \u03c4 \u2213 , [36]\n5.3. Other constraints\nIn addition the EDM of the neutron can be calculated using two different models for the neutron\nwhere the formulas are based on [32] and we use the same hadronic parameters. Moreover, one can also\ncalculate the SUSY contributions to the \u03c1-parameter as given in [37].\n6. Extensions to SLHA\nIn this section we describe the SPheno specific extensions to the SUSY Les Houches Accord (SLHA)\n[7, 2]. We start first with extensions to existing blocks and then discuss new blocks which either control\nthe behaviour of SPheno or contain additional model parameters for MSSM extensions. Note, that all\nadditional Yukawa couplings have been implemented in complex forms and the corresponding information\ncan be passed by using the corresponding blocks starting with IM [2].\n\n4\n\n\f6.1. Extensions of existing blocks\n6.1.1. Block MINPAR\nIn the case that generation mixing is switched on, i.e. the entry 6 contains a non-zero value, then\nindependent of this value flavour violation is switched on in the (s)lepton as well as in the (s)quark sector.\nIn case of extending the model by a minimal SU (5) as used in [15] this block gets extended by the\nfollowing entries\n7: SO(10) scale where the universal soft SUSY breaking parameters are defined.\n8: extra D-terms due to the breaking of SO(10) to SU (5)\n9: \u03bb-coupling of the Higgs 24-plet to the 5\u0304H\n10: \u03bb\u2032 -coupling of the Higgs 24-plet to the 5H\n6.1.2. Block MODSEL\nFour switches have been added to flag 3 (particle content)\n2: includes the particle content of a minimal SU (5) model between MGUT and a user chosen SO(10)\nscale, where the SUSY boundary conditions are set. The details of this model are described in\n[15]. In this case the mass parameters of the right handed neutrinos are stored in the block MNURIN\n(section 6.2.2) and the corresponding neutrino Yukawa couplings can be stored in the block YNU0IN\n(section 6.2.7). The data is understood to be defined at the GUT-scale.

This is in particular useful in case one uses the\nprogram Prospino [40] or older versions of the program Phythia [41].\n7\n\n\f6.2.6. Block YB3IN\nHere one can specify the neutrino Yukawa YijIII coupling at MGUT for the seesaw type III model using\nthe formulas of [13], where the data are given in the FORTRAN format\n(1x,2i3,3x,1p,e16.8,3x,'#',a)\nwhere the first two integers in the format correspond to i and j and the double precision number to\nYukawa coupling.\n6.2.7.

Installation and implementing new models\n7.1. Installation\nSPheno can be downloaded from\nhttp://projects.hepforge.org/spheno/\nwhere the latest tar-ball SPheno3.x.y.tar.gz can found as well as older versions. Unpacking will create\nthe directory SPheno3.x.y where x and y are integers corresponding to the sub-version. This directory\nwill contain the following subdirectories:\n\u2022 bin: here the executable SPheno will be stored\n\u2022 doc: contains the SPheno documentations\n\u2022 include: here all the mod-files are stored\n\u2022 input: contains input example files\n\u2022 lib: here the library libSPheno.a will be stored\n\u2022 output: contains the output files corresponding to the examples stored in input\n\u2022 src: contains the source code\nThe directory SPheno3.x.y contains a Makefile which can be used to compile SPheno. The default\ncompiler is Intels ifort, but by typing make F90=compiler on the console one can use a different compiler\nwhere compiler has to replaced by the compiler's name. The following compilers have been added NAG\nnagfor, Lahey lf95 and g95.\nIt is well known that compilation of the module RGEs.F90 can be time consuming due to the length\nof the 2-loop RGEs for the seesaw models of type II and type III. For this reason they are not compiled\nby default. If the corresponding RGEs should be included then the line\nPreDef = -DGENERATIONMIXING -DONLYDOUBLE\nshould be replaced by\n9\n\n\fPreDef = -DGENERATIONMIXING -DONLYDOUBLE -DSEESAWIII\ni.e. add -DSEESAWIII.\nIn the case that one want to have quadrupole precision in various parts of the code instead of double\nprecision, one has to take out the -DONLYDOUBLE in the line mentioned above. Note that this can\nsubstantially slow down SPheno. Moreover, not all parts are yet implemented with quadrupole precision.\nThe main focus has been on the loop functions as well as on mixing between neutralinos and neutrinos\nin case of R-parity violation.\n7.2. Implementing new models\nNew models can easily implemented using the SARAH package [42, 43]. For this purpose one has\nto put the code generated by SARAH in a new directory within the directory SPheno3.x.y and run the\ncorresponding Makefile. An additional executable will be stored in the directory bin.\n8. Input and output\nStarting with version SPheno 3.1 there are two main differences with respect to the input and output\n1. SPheno accepts only the SLHA input format as specified and all the output is given in this format. In section 6 we have described the extensions to control program specific features as well\nas model extensions. The orginal SPheno input using the files HighScale.in, StandardModel.in\nand Control.in as well as the output in the file SPheno.out have been disabled. Detailed error\nmessages and warnings will also be written to the file Messages.out.\n2. One can provide input name and output name as command line options where the first (second)\nname, if present, is interpreted as input (output) filename, e.g.\nSPheno InName OutName\ntakes InName for the file containing the input and will write the output to the file OutName. In case\nthat the file InName is not found SPheno will look for a file called LesHouches.in as default. The\ndefault name for the output is SPheno.spc. The length of the names InName and OutName must\nnot exceed 60 characters.\n9. Conclusions and comments\nSPheno is constantly developing, in particular in view of implementing additional models and low\nenergy observables. In addition it is planed\n\u2022 to implement the missing pieces of the SLHA conventions as listed in appendix Appendix B.\n\u2022 mixing between A0 and H0 in case of CP phases\n\u2022 low energy observables for the case of R-parity violation\nIn section 5 several hadronic parameters for the calculation of low energy observables are hard-coded in\nthe program. It is planned to construct routines to allow user defined changes in the future.\nAcknowledgements\nW.P. thanks M.

Loop corrections\nHere we list the improvements which have been implemented in SPheno with respect to ref. [4]:\n\u2022 in the 1-loop corrections to the gluino mass we use for the gluon contribution\n\u2206(\u03a3g\u0303 ) = \u2212\n\n\u0001\n3g32\nB1 (p2 , m2g\u0303,T , 0) \u2212 2B1 (p2 , m2g\u0303,T , 0)\n8\u03c0 2\n\n(D.1)\n\nwhere mg\u0303,T is the tree level gluino mass and which reduces for p2 = m2g\u0303,T to the formula\ng2\n\u2206(\u03a3g\u0303 ) = \u2212 3 2\n16\u03c0\n\n15 + 9 log\n\nQ2\nm2g\u0303,T\n\n!!\n\n(D.2)\n\nof ref.
