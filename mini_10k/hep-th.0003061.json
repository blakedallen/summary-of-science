INTRODUCTION\n\nRecent developments in string theory have shown that\nif matter fields are localized on a 3-brane in 1 + 3 + d\ndimensions, while gravity can propagate in the d extra\ndimensions, then the extra dimensions can be large (see,\ne.g., [1]). The extra dimensions need not even be compact, as in the 5-dimensional warped space models of\nRandall and Sundrum [2]. (See also [3] for earlier work.)\nIn particular, they showed that it is possible to localize gravity on a 3-brane when there is one infinite extra\ndimension.\nIf matter on a 3-brane collapses under gravity, without rotating, to form a black hole, then the metric on the\nbrane-world should be close to the Schwarzschild metric\nat astrophysical scales in order to preserve the observationally tested predictions of general relativity. Collapse\nto a black hole in the Randall-Sundrum brane-world scenario was studied by Chamblin et al. [4] (see also [5\u20138]).\nThey gave a 'black string' solution which intersects the\nbrane in a Schwarzschild solution.\nHere we give an exact localized black hole solution,\nwhich remarkably has the mathematical form of the\nReissner-N\u00f6rdstrom solution, but without electric charge\nbeing present. Instead the Reissner-N\u00f6rdstrom-type correction to the Schwarzschild potential can be thought of\nas a 'tidal charge', arising from the projection onto the\nbrane of free gravitational field effects in the bulk. These\neffects are transmitted via the bulk Weyl tensor (see\nbelow). The Schwarzschild potential \u03a6 = \u2212M/(Mp2 r),\nwhere Mp is the effective Planck mass on the brane, is\nmodified to\n\u03a6=\u2212\n\nM\nQ\n+ 2,\n2\nMp r 2r\n\nwhere the tildes denote bulk quantities.

The brane is located at \u03c7 = 0 (so that x4 = \u03c7 is\na natural choice for the fifth dimension coordinate), and\ngAB = e\ngAB \u2212 nA nB is the induced metric on the brane,\nwith nA the spacelike unit normal to the brane. The\nbrane energy-momentum tensor is TAB , and TAB nB = 0.\nThe brane is a fixed point of the Z2 symmetry.\nII. FIELD EQUATIONS ON THE BRANE\n\nThe field equations induced on the brane arise from\nEq. (2), the Gauss-Codazzi equations and the matching\nconditions with Z2 -symmetry, and they may be written\nas a modification of the standard Einstein equations, with\nthe new terms carrying bulk effects onto the brane [9]:\nG\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212\u039bg\u03bc\u03bd + \u03ba2 T\u03bc\u03bd + \u03ba\ne4 S\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 E\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03ba2 = 8\u03c0/Mp2 .

SOLUTIONS WITH TIDAL CHARGE\n\n.\n\nAlgebraic symmetry properties imply that in general\nwe can decompose E\u03bc\u03bd irreducibly with respect to a chosen 4-velocity field u\u03bc as [11]\n\n(4)\n\nTypically, the fundamental Planck scale is much lower\nfp \u226a Mp .\nthan the effective scale in the brane-world: M\nLocal bulk effects on the matter are transmitted via the\n'squared energy-momentum' tensor S\u03bc\u03bd , but since we\nwill consider vacuum solutions, the precise form of S\u03bc\u03bd\n(see [9]) will not be needed. In vacuum, T\u03bc\u03bd = 0 = S\u03bc\u03bd ,\nand we also choose the bulk cosmological constant to sate = \u22124\u03c0\u03bb2 /3M\nfp3 , so that \u039b = 0 by Eq. (4). Then\nisfy \u039b\nEq. (3) reduces to\nR\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212E\u03bc\u03bd , R\u03bc \u03bc = 0 = E\u03bc \u03bc ,\n\nE\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(8)\n\nwhere h\u03bc\u03bd = g\u03bc\u03bd + u\u03bc u\u03bd projects orthogonal to u\u03bc . Here\nU=\u2212\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nThe Weyl symmetries ensure that this is symmetric and\ntracefree (E[AB] = 0 = EA A ) and has no orthogonal components (EAB nB = 0, so that EAB \u2192 E\u03bc\u03bd \u03b4A \u03bc \u03b4B \u03bd as\n\u03c7 \u2192 0). It carries the influence of nonlocal gravitational\ndegrees of freedom in the bulk onto the brane, including\nthe tidal (or Coulomb) and transverse traceless (gravitational wave) aspects of the free gravitational field. (See\n[11] for a fuller discussion of E\u03bc\u03bd in the general case.) On\nthe brane, in the vacuum case, this tensor satisfies the\ndivergence constraint [9]\n\u2207\u03bc E\u03bc\u03bd = 0 ,\n\n\u0010 \u03ba \u00114\n\u03ba\ne\n\nE\u03bc\u03bd u\u03bc u\u03bd\n\nis an effective energy density on the brane arising from\nthe free gravitational field in the bulk-but note that\nthis energy density need not be positive. Indeed, as we\nargue below, U < 0 is the natural case. The effective\nanisotropic stress from the free gravitational field in the\nbulk is the spatially tracefree and symmetric part, i.e.,\n\nwhere E\u03bc\u03bd is the limit on the brane of the projected bulk\nWeyl tensor [9]:\neACBD nC nD .\nEAB = C\n\n\u0012 \u00134\n\u0001\n\u0003\n\u03ba\ne \u0002\nU u\u03bc u\u03bd + 13 h\u03bc\u03bd + P\u03bc\u03bd + 2Q(\u03bc u\u03bd) ,\n=\u2212\n\u03ba\n\nP\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212\n\n\u0010 \u03ba \u00114 \u0002\n\u03ba\ne\n\n\u0003\nh(\u03bc \u03b1 h\u03bd) \u03b2 \u2212 31 h\u03bc\u03bd h\u03b1\u03b2 E\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n\nwhere round brackets denote symmetrization. The effective energy flux from the free gravitational field in the\nbulk is\n\u0010 \u03ba \u00114\nh\u03bc \u03b1 E\u03b1\u03b2 u\u03b2 .\nQ\u03bc =\n\u03ba\ne\n\nIn a static vacuum, with u\u03bc along the static Killing\ndirection, we have Q\u03bc = 0, and the effective conservation\nequation (7) reduces to the single spatial equation\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u2207\u03bc is the brane covariant derivative. In view of\nthe Bianchi identities on the brane, this is an integrability condition for the field equation R\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212E\u03bc\u03bd . For\nstatic solutions, Eqs. (5) and (7) form a closed system of\nequations on the brane [11].\nA vacuum solution outside a mass localized on the\nbrane must satisfy equations (5) and (7). This leads to a\nprescription for mapping 4-dimensional general relativity\nsolutions to brane-world solutions in 5-dimensional gravity: a stationary general relativity solution with tracefree energy-momentum tensor gives rise to a vacuum\nbrane-world solution in 5-dimensional gravity. The 4dimensional general relativity energy-momentum tensor\nT\u03bc\u03bd (where T\u03bc \u03bc = 0) is formally identified with the bulk\nWeyl term on the brane via the correspondence\n\n1\n3 D\u03bc U\n\n+ 34 UA\u03bc + D\u03bd P\u03bc\u03bd + A\u03bd P\u03bc\u03bd = 0 ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere D\u03bc is the projection (orthogonal to u\u03bc ) of the\nbrane covariant derivative [12], and A\u03bc = u\u03bd \u2207\u03bd u\u03bc is the\n4-acceleration. Static spherical symmetry means that\n\u0002\n\u0003\nA\u03bc = A(r)r\u03bc , P\u03bc\u03bd = P(r) r\u03bc r\u03bd \u2212 31 h\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\nfor some functions A(r) and P(r), where r is the areal\ndistance and r\u03bc is a unit radial vector.

This can be seen clearly\nfrom Eq. (1). By contrast, the q < 0 case corresponds\nto the opposite effect, i.e., bulk effects tend to strengthen\nthe gravitational field. By Eq. (10), we see that in this\ncase, the effective energy density U on the brane contributed by the free gravitational field in the bulk is negative. This is in accord with the (Newtonian) notion\nthat the gravitational field of an isolated mass has negative energy density. Furthermore, it agrees with the\nperturbative analysis by Sasaki et al. [13] and the nonperturbative analysis of Maartens [11]. The gravitational\nfield generated by a source on the brane tends to squeeze\ntest matter in the 5th direction, thus acting as an attractive field with a negative energy contribution. The tidal\nacceleration measured by static observers along the 5th\ndirection nA is [11]\n\n(12)\n\u03b2\n,\nr4\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are constants. Equations (12) and (13)\nsatisfy all the field equations (5), and hence also the divergence equations (7). By Eqs. (8) and (10), we see that\n\u03b2 = Q, and the far-field Newtonian limit [see Eq. (1)]\nshows that \u03b1 = \u22122M/Mp2 .\nIn summary, we have shown that an exact black hole\nsolution of the effective field equations on the brane is\ngiven by the induced metric\n!\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2M 1\nq\n1\n\u22121\n\u2212 gtt = (grr ) = 1 \u2212\n, (14)\n+\n2\nfp2 r2\nMp r\nM\n\nfp2 is a dimensionless tidal charge paramwhere q = QM\neter.

(2) and (6).\nThe negative bulk cosmological constant contributes to\nacceleration towards the brane, reflecting its confining\nrole on the gravitational field. In order for U to reinforce\nconfinement, it must be negative. In other words, negative tidal charge q < 0 is the physically more natural case.\n(See also [14] for further discussion of negative energy\ndensity from bulk effects.) Furthermore, q < 0 ensures\nthat the singularity is spacelike, as in the Schwarzschild\nsolution, whereas q > 0 leads to a timelike singularity,\nwhich amounts to a qualitative change in the nature of\nthe general relativistic Schwarzschild solution.\nIt is widely assumed that astrophysical black holes cannot exhibit macroscopic electric charge due to the presence of neutralizing plasma in their vicinity. Discussions\nof astrophysical black hole phenomena are therefore commonly restricted to the Kerr family of black holes. The\nsolution presented here raises the possibility that an effective Reissner-N\u00f6rdstrom metric emerges by geometric considerations and is hence not constrained by the\nabove argument. The tidal charge q affects the geodesics\nand the gravitational potential, so that indirect limits\nmay be placed on it by observations. Current observational limits on |q| are rather weak, since the correction\nterm in Eq. (1) dies off rapidly with increasing r, and\nastrophysical measurements (lensing and perihelion precession) probe mostly (weak-field) solar scales. These\nmeasurements require the correction term in the gravitational potential to be much less than the Schwarzschild\nterm, so that\n\nIV. PROPERTIES OF THE BLACK HOLE\n\nThe 4-dimensional horizon structure of the braneworld black hole depends on the sign of q. For q \u2265 0,\nthere is a direct analogy to the Reissner-N\u00f6rdstrom solution, with two horizons:\n\"\n#\ns\nMp4\nM\nr\u00b1 = 2 1 \u00b1 1 \u2212 q\n.\n(16)\nf2\nMp\nM 2M\np\n\nAs in general relativity, both horizons lie inside the\nSchwarzschild horizon: 0 \u2264 r\u2212 \u2264 r+ \u2264 rs = 2M/Mp2 ,\nand there is an upper limit on q:\n!\nfp \u0012 M \u00132\nM\n.\n(17)\n0 \u2264 q \u2264 qmax =\nMp\nMp\nThe intriguing new possibility that q < 0, which is impossible in the general relativity Reissner-N\u00f6rdstrom case,\nleads to only one horizon, lying outside the Schwarzschild\nhorizon:\n\"\n#\ns\nMp4\nM\nr+ = 2 1 + 1 \u2212 q\n> rs .\n(18)\nfp2\nMp\nM 2M\n\nIn the q < 0 case, the (single) horizon has a greater\narea than its Schwarzschild counterpart, so that bulk effects act to increase the entropy and decrease the temperature of the black hole. In general relativity, the electric\nfield in the Reissner-N\u00f6rdstrom solutions acts to weaken\n\n|q| \u226a 2\n\nfp\nM\nMp\n\n!2\n\nM\u2299 R\u2299 .\n\n(19)\n\nThis still allows for large values of |q|, which would modify the spacetime geometry of a nonrotating black hole in\n3\n\n\fIt turns out that if ds2 is given by our solution, as in\nEqs.

Although the strong-gravity regime is not currently\ndirectly accessible to observations, indirect limits could\nemerge from the way in which tidal charge modifies general relativity strong-gravity effects. This deserves further investigation.\nFurther indirect limits could arise from the effect of\ntidal charge on primordial black holes, which also merits\nfurther analysis. An intriguing possibility is that strong\ntidal effects in the early universe could lead to black hole\nformation even in the absence of gravitational collapse\nof matter. If such matter-free tidal collapse is possible,\nthen the endstate is a metric with M = 0 and q < 0:\n!\nq\n1\n\u22121\n\u2212 gtt = (grr ) = 1 +\n,\n(20)\n2\nf\nMp r 2\n\nand the horizon on the brane is given by\n\u221a\n\u2212q\n.\nrh =\nfp\nM\n\ncannot satisfy the bulk field equations for any f (z) if\nq 6= 0. Finding an exact form of the bulk metric that is\nconsistent with our exact induced metric on the brane is\nmore difficult than the case where the induced metric is\nSchwarzschild.\nPerturbative studies, which start from an exactly antide Sitter background, show that the first weak-field correction of the Newtonian potential on the brane is proportional to 1/r3 (see [2,6,8,13]). Our solution has by\ncontrast a 1/r2 correction, so that it is incompatible with\nthe long-distance limit on the brane. (Such a correction\ncan also arise in thick-brane models [8].) However, in the\nshort-distance limit on the brane, the lowest order correction to the potential is proportional to 1/r2 [16]. This\nterm will dominate the 1/r term, which reflects the fact\nthat gravity becomes effectively 5-dimensional at high energies. Thus our solution should describe well the stronggravity regime on the brane. In the short-distance limit,\nthe perturbative analysis shows that [16]\n\n(21)\n\nThe tidal charge parameter arises from purely scalar\n(Coulomb-like) effects of the free gravitational field in the\nbulk, given the static spherical symmetry. In the original Randall-Sundrum model, as well as in perturbative\nstudies of it (see, e.g., [2,6,8,13]), the bulk is assumed to\nbe exactly anti-de Sitter in the absence of any source on\nthe brane. The geometric approach of [9], which we have\nadopted here, makes no assumptions about the bulk metric, other than that it satisfies the 5-dimensional Einstein\nequations with cosmological constant. Thus the bulk\nneed not be conformally flat in the absence of sources on\nthe brane. This means that in general, the tidal charge\nparameter q will be determined by both the brane source,\ni.e., the mass M , and any Coulomb part of the bulk Weyl\ntensor that survives when M is set to zero.\n\nq=\u2212\n\nM\n,\nf\nMp\n\nso that the tidal charge is negative, as we argued above,\nand is determined by the black hole mass (which is to be\nexpected if the background bulk Weyl tensor vanishes).\nIn order to pursue our nonperturbative analysis, we\nneed to look at the off-brane equations for the curvature\n(see [13] for the general form of these equations). The\ninduced field equations on the brane given in Eq. (5) are\nsupplemented by off-brane equations which determine\nLn EAB , Ln BABC , Ln RABCD ,\nwhere Ln is the Lie derivative along nA , RABCD is the\n4-dimensional Riemann tensor, and\neDECF nF ,\nBABC = gA D gB E C\n\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nwith B\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3 = 0 on the brane. These equations together\nwith Eq. (5) form a closed system [13].\nIn conclusion, we have shown how a ReissnerN\u00f6rdstrom-type metric satisfies the effective field equations on the brane in Randall-Sundrum-type gravity,\nwhich form a closed system because of staticity. There\nis no electric charge present, but instead a tidal charge,\narising from the imprint of the free gravitational field in\nthe bulk on the brane. The tidal charge correction to\nthe Schwarzschild potential is negative, and the solution\ndescribes the strong-gravity regime on the brane. Negative q leads to an horizon on the brane that is outside\nthe Schwarzschild horizon, corresponding to lower temperature and greater entropy. Current observations place\nonly weak limits on the tidal charge, and in principle significant tidal modifications could arise in the strong-field\n\nWe have not investigated fully the effect of the braneworld black hole on the bulk geometry, and in particular\nthe nature of the off-brane horizon structure. This has\nbeen done for solutions which reduce to the Schwarzschild\nblack hole on the brane [4]. In these solutions, the bulk\nmetric is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0003\n6\n1 \u0002 2\nds\u03032 = \u2212\ndz + g\u03bc\u03bd (x\u03b1 )dx\u03bc dx\u03bd ,\n2\ne z\n\u03ba\ne2 \u039b\nwhere g\u03bc\u03bd is the Schwarzschild metric. We have adopted\na different approach: instead of starting from an induced Schwarzschild metric, we have solved the effective field equations for the induced metric on the brane\n(which form a closed system, since the metric is static),\nand found a generalization of the Schwarzschild solution.\n\n4\n\n\fregime or in the early-universe case of primordial black\nholes. Further investigation is in progress to probe these\nmodifications and any indirect limits that they may impose on the tidal charge, as well as to find the off-brane\nbehaviour of the horizon.\n\n[8] C.
