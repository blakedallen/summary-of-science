Generation of the large-scale coherent vortical structurs in homogeneous shear\nflow couples dynamical processes of energy and enstrophy production. In the large rate of\nstrain limit, the simple estimates of the contributions to the energy and enstrophy equations result in a dynamical system, describing experimentally and numerically observed selfsustained non-linear oscillations of energy and enstrophy. It is shown that the period of these\noscilaltions is independent upon the box size and the energy and enstrophy fluctuations are\nstrongly correlated.\n\n1\n\n\fDue to its seeming simplicity, the problem of homogeneous shear flow has widely been\nused as a benchmark for nu merical and experimental tests of various closures for turbulence\nmodelling. All early closures were based on the Kolmogorov ideas developed for statistically\nsteady isotropic and homogeneous small-scale turbulence interacting with the non-universal\nlarge-scale flow-field. It became clear that to validate this physically appealing concept, one\nhad to verify and understand the symmetries and other statistical properties of the smallscale velocity fluctuations in the real-life flows. This was the main focus of the experimental\nstudies of homogenious shear flow [1]-[6]. The interest in this model flow is also related\nto the recent numerical investigations which revealed coherent structures resembling those,\nresponsible for turbulence production, in the wall- sheared flows [7]-[13]. This system has\nalso often been used for calibration of various constants in semi-empirical turbulence models\n[15],[16].\nThe problem is formulated as follows: consider a flow in a cube of a side a, so that\n\u2212a < xi < a. The velocity field\nv(x, t) = U(y)e1 + u(x, t)\n\n(1)\n\nwith the imposed mean velocity < v >= U(y)e1 = Sye1 (the definition of the averaging\noperation will be introduced below). The vorticity is defined then:\n\n\u03a9 = \u2212Se3 + \u03c9\n\n(2)\n\nThe equations of motion for the fluctuating components of velocity and vorticity are\n(density \u03c1 = 1):\n\n\u2202t u + u * \u2207u = \u2212Sve1 \u2212 \u2207p \u2212 U(y)\u2202x u + \u03bd\u22072 u,\n\n(3)\n\n\u2202t \u03c9 + u * \u2207\u03c9 = \u03c9 * \u2207u \u2212 S(\u2212\u2202z we3 + \u2202x we1 + \u2202z ve2 ) \u2212 Sy\u2202x \u03c9\n\n(4)\n\n\u2207*u= 0\n\n(5)\n\nand\n\n2\n\n\fThe x, y and z-components of velocity field are denoted hereafter as u, v and w, respectively.\nLet us define the averaging operations:\n1 1\nF =< F (x, t) >=\nTV\n\nZ\n\nT\n\nZ\n\nV\n\n0\n\ndxdtF (x, t)\n\nin the limit V = a3 \u2192 \u221e; T \u2192 \u221e. The statistically steady state is assumed here. The\nspacial averaging is defined as\n1\nF (t) = F (x, t) =\nV\n\nZ\n\nV\n\ndxF (x, t)\n\nThe kinetic energy equation is (\u03bd \u2192 0):\n1\n\u2202t K + ui \u2207i u2j = \u2212\u03c4uv S \u2212 \u2207i pui \u2212 E\n2\n\n(6)\n\n2\n\nwith \u03c4vu = uv. The contribution U(y) \u2202u\n= 0 due to the symmetry of the problem.\n\u2202x\nSince in a homogeneous flow all spacial derivatives of the mean properties are equal to\nzero, the modelling is reduced to investigation of the time evolution of turbulent kinetic\nenergy K = u2i /2 and dissipation rate E = \u03bd(\u2202i uj )2 .\nFor small perturbations from isotropic and homogeneous state (S \u2192 0 and pu = pv = 0),\nthe typical turbulence models, based on the equilibrium ideas are [15], [16]:\n\n\u2202t K = \u2212\u03c4ij Sij \u2212 E\n\n(7)\n\nand\n\n\u2202t E = \u2212C\u01eb1 \u03c4ij Sij\n\nE\nE2\n\u2212 C\u01eb2\nK\nK\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the Reynolds stress \u03c4ij = vi vj . The coefficients C\u01ebi = O(1). A simple expression, valid\nat the long times t > K/E,\n\u03c4ij \u2248 \u2212\u03bdT Sij\n\n(9)\n\nwith turbulent viscosity \u03bdT \u221d K2 /E, closes the set of equations (7)-(9) and defines the so\ncalled K \u2212 E model, widely used in engineering for modelling the not-too strongly sheared\n3\n\n\fflows. The unknown magnitudes of the proportionality coefficients are typically determined\nin a following way. Consider a flow with S = 0. The unknown coefficient C\u01eb2 can be found\nfrom comparing the analytic solution of the simple equations (7)-(9) with experimental and\nnumerical data. The same flow can also be used to test the results of analytic theories\n[15]-[16]. If S 6= 0, solution of (7)-(9) is not easy and the coefficient C\u01eb1 can be found from\ncomparison with the data. The solution of equation (7)-(9) with the fixed values of the\ncoefficients showed a close to exponential long-time growth of turbulent kinetic energy in a\ngood agreement with the outcome of direct numerical simulations [15]-[16]. If the shear is\nimposed on a decaying isotropic turbulence at t = 0, the observed [16] initial, short- time\ndecay of kinetic energy is readily explained by the fact that turbulent viscosity\n\n\u03bdT \u2248\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nv(0)v(\u03c4 )d\u03c4\n\n0\n\nwhich is small at short times.\nRecent numerical experiments revealed a much more complicated picture. Driven by a\nvery strong shear (the criterion is derived below), in the long-time limit, the system developed\na limit cycle -like strong fluctuations of the total kinetic energy about the mean value < K >\n[7]-[13]. The amplitude of these fluctuations was up to two-three times that of < K >. Similar\neffect was observed by Borue et. al. [14] in a three-dimensional Kolmogorov flow driven by\na steady forcing f = (0, 0, cos(x)). Elucidation of the origin of these oscillations is the goal\nof this paper.\nThe physical process observed in both homogeneous shear and Kolmogorov flows can be\ndescribed in two steps: first, the shear generates both kinetic energy and vortical structures\nleading to the access of the energy production. Then, the structures become unstable and\nrapidly disappear with the energy dissipation taking over. The process repeats itself. The\nevolution of kinetic energy and enstrophy fluctuations in 3D Kolmogorov flow, conducted\nby Borue et al [14], revealed extremely strong correlation: the sharp spikes in the enstrophy\nand energy time-signals were almost simultanious with a slight time-lag, thus suporting the\nimportance of coherent vortical structures in the process.\nAt the long times the numerical homogeneous shear flow problem (1)-(3) has two very\n4\n\n\fimportant features. We can see from the equation of motion that the flow, defined on a cube,\ncannot be periodic in space. Second, the integral scale L in this situation is not a dynamic\nvariable which is a function of K and E, but prescribed by the box size, so that L \u2248 a. This\nputs strong constrains on the modelling of various contributions to the equations (1)-(3).\nNow, we would like to establish the main characteristic length-scales. The non-universal\nvelocity fluctuations belong to the range of scales a \u2248 L < r < rc with the cross-over scale\n\u221a\n3\nrc \u2248 E/S 2 are dominated by powerful anisortopic coherent structures (vortices). The\nunivesal range, populated by the more or less isotropic excitations, spreads over the interval\n1\n\nrc < r < rd \u2248 (\u03bd 3 /E) 4 . The Kolmogorov spectrum can be expected in the range with the\ntotal energy of quasy-isotropic fluctuations\n\nq\u2248\n\nZ\n\nrc\n\nrd\n\n2\n\n2\n\nE(k)dk \u221d rc3 \u2212 rd3 > 0\n\n(10)\n\nWe can see that the inertial range shrinks to zero when the strain rate becomes large.\nThis fact, noticed in Ref. [13], defines the strong shear regime. In strongly anisortopic flow,\nthe simple expression (9), is invalid.\nFirst , let us consider the equation for \u03c9 2 :\n1\n1\n\u2202t \u03c9 2 + \u2202i ui \u03c9 2 = \u03c9 * \u03c9 * \u2207u \u2212 S(\u2212\u03c9z \u2202z w + \u03c91 \u2202x w + \u03c92 \u2202z v) \u2212 \u03bd(\u2202i \u03c9j )2\n2\n2\n\n(11)\n\nDue to powerful, shear-generated coherent vortical structures, \u03c9y \u03c9x = O(\u03c9 2) and the contribution involving longitudinal derivative \u2202z w can be neglected. The simple dimensional\nconsiderations lead to:\n\n\u03c9 * \u03c9 * \u2207u = O(urms\u03c9 2 /L); S(\u03c9x \u2202x w + \u03c9y \u2202z v) = O(S\u03c9 2)\nand denoting A(t) = \u03c9 2 /S 2 we have:\n\n\u2202t A(t) = \u03b3(\nwith all coefficients \u03b3, a and \u03b1 = O(1).\n\na \u221a\nK \u2212 \u03b1)SA(t)\nLS\n\n5\n\n(12)\n\n\fTo estimate \u03c4uv , we observe that in the limit of interest (see below) the only relevant\ntime scale is \u03c4c \u2248 1/S. From the equation (3) we have an estimate for the stress:\n\u03c4uv = u(t)v(t) \u2248 u(t)\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nt\u2212\u03c4c\n\nd\u03bb(\u2212u(\u03bb) * \u2207v(\u03bb) \u2212 \u2207y p(\u03bb))\n\n(13)\n\nwhere the \"initial condition \u03c4uv (t \u2212 \u03c4c ) was neglected for simplicity (see below). The dimensional estimate gives:\n3\n\n\u03c4uv\n\nK2\n= B(t)\nSL\n\n(14)\n\nwhere B(t) is an \"anisotropy factor\" or \"order parameter\" characterizing the varying in time\nstrength of the coherent vortical structures. The appearence of this factor is natural (see\nbelow) since in an isotropic, non-sheared flow lacking coherent vortices B(t) = const = 0,\nwhile in the strongly sheared flow these structures contribute to the energy production. The\n3\n\ndissipation rate in shear flows is estimated as E = bK 2 /L with the coefficient b \u2248 1 leading\nto a model equation:\n3\n\nor, introducing y =\n\n\u221a\n\nK:\n\nK2\nKt (t) \u2248 (B(t) \u2212 b)\nL\n\n(15)\n\nB(t) \u2212 b 2\ny\nL\n\n(16)\n\n2\u2202t y(t) =\n\nBy the virtue of (2), the mean value of vorticity in homogeneous shear flow is < \u03a9 >= S.\nThus, the natural measure of the strength of the strongly anisotropic fluctuating coherent\nvortical structures is the ratio \u03c9 2 /S 2 . Based on these considerations , we set A(t) = B(t).\nThis result can be derived in the third-order of the iteration procedure of the expression (13).\nIndeed, inserting an unknown initial condition into (13), one can use \u03c4uv (t\u2212\u03c4c ) = \u03c40 as a zero\norder solution. Then, after simple resummation (neglecting the first -order contributions)\nwe obtain:\n\n\u03c4uv (t) = \u03c40 +\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nt\u2212\u03c4c\n\nu(t)u(\u03bb) * \u2207v(\u03bb)+\n\nZ Z Z\n\nu(t)u(\u03bb) * \u2207u(\u03bb\u2032 ) * \u2207u(\u03bb\u2032\u2032 ) * \u2207v(\u03bb\u2032\u2032 )d\u03bbd\u03bb\u2032 d\u03bb\u2032\u2032 +***\n6\n\n\fThis expression immediately gives (14) with B(\u03c9) \u2248\n\n\u03c92\n,\nS2\n\nprovided the derivatives \u2202i uj \u2248\n\n\u03c9. This approximate derivation is given here to demonstrate the mechanism of vorticity\nappearence in the expression for the reynolds stress \u03c4uv . It will become clear below that the\npower of vorticity in the expression B(\u03c9) \u221d \u03c9 n is unimportant.\nThe fact that the anisotropic ordered structures can influence the magnitude and even\nsign of the energy fluxes is known for a long time. The rigorous linear stability analysis\ndeveloped in [17]-[18], showed that even in three-dimensional flows the strongly anisotropic\nstructures (basic flows), are capable of reversing the sign of the energy flux, due to the\n\"negative viscosity\" effects and lead to substantial growth of a small large-scale perturbation.\nIn the opposite limit of the isotropic basic flows, the theory showed generation of positive\neffective viscosity and acceleration of the energy dissipation. These features are incorporated\nin the model (12),(15), (16): indeed, we see that if A(t) > b, the energy grows, while, when\nA < b, it decays. The model equation (12) includes the well-known process of the vortex\nbreak -down: when v 2 >> \u03c9 2 L2 , the instability leads to the vortex disappearence.\nDefining dimensionless variables Z =\n\ny\n,\nSL\n\nZ0 =\n\n\u03b1\na\n\nand T = St gives:\n\n2\u2202T Z(T ) = a(A(T ) \u2212 b)Z 2 (T )\n\n(17)\n\n\u2202T A(T ) = \u2212\u03b3(Z(T ) \u2212 Z0 )A(T )\n\n(18)\n\nand\n\nwhere Z0 > 0 = const, related to the mean amplitude of Z(t).\nThe equations (17),(18) have a steady-state solution Z(T ) = Z0 and A(T ) = b. A simple\nlinear stability analysis shows periodic solution when the amplitude of the perturbation is\nvery small. The numerical solutions of quations (17),(18), presented on Figs. 1-6, revealed\nstrong non-linear oscillations. All calculations were perforemed with MathematicaT M . In\na wide range of parameter variation, the system generates non-linear oscillations with the\nshape depending upon initial values Z(0) and A(0). For a given set of parameters the\nfrequency of oscillations is proportional to the strain rate S.\n\n7\n\n\fFor the initial values of Z(0) and A(0) \u2248 1, the solution shows reasonably smooth\noscillations with Z and A being somewhat out of phase (see Figs. 1,2). The result supports\na general physical picture of the anisotropy A(t) (order parameter) and energy growing\n(decaying) together with some time-lag. The energy fluctuations are by a factor 2-3 larger\nthan S 2 L2 . When the initial energy was doubled to Z(0) = 3., the oscilaltions became much\nless symmetric with the steeper energy grows (Figs. 3,4). The crucial role of the \"order\nparameter\" A(0) is demonstrated on Figs. 5,6 corresponding to Z(0) = 2 and A(0) = 0.1.\nWe can see the the formation steep shock-like structures, somewhat resembling turbulenceproduction bursts.\nIn the range of large Z(0) and very small A(0) << 1, the solution blows up, indicating\nthe unphysicality of these initial conditions corresponding to the large energy fluctuations\n(urms (0) >> SL) and small anisortopy (order) parameter (\u03c9 2 << S 2 ).\nTo discuss the above results, let us look at this work from a somewhat different angle. The\nKolmogorov relation S3,0 (r) = (u(x + r) \u2212 u(x))3 \u221d r, is a statement about constantcy of the\nenergy flux for inertial range wave numbers k \u2248 1/r >> 1/L of isotropic and homogeneous\nturbulence. As r \u2192 L, the structure function S3,0 (r) \u2192 0. In strongly anisotropic flows\nwith the integral scalle L \u2248 a, this is not so: depending on the spacial distribution of\nvelocity (vorticity), the moment S3 (L) 6= 0. If vorticity (enstrophy) is an \"order\" parameter,\n3\n\ncharacterizing deviations from isotropy, then S3 (L) \u2248 B(\u03c9)K 2 /L where B(\u03c9) \u2192 0 when the\nstrength of the structures diminishes. This qualitative statement is supported by the wellknown fact that the velocity field, generated by the vortex v(r) \u221d \u0393\u03c6(r), where the circulation\n\u0393 = O(\u03c9L2). Combined with the equation for the enstrophy, the two relations (17),(18) form\na dynamical system leading to strong fluctuations of both energy and enstrophy. The shape\nof the function B(\u03c9) does not seem to influence the qualitative aspects of the process: the\nmodel (17),(18) is invariant under transformation A(t) \u2192 An with a simple rescaling of time.\nAll this is valid when L \u2248 a. If this is not so, the magnitude of the fluctuations must\n\nsubstantially decrease. Indeed, if a >> L, then we are dealing with N = ( La )d independent\n\nsystems. Here d is the force dimensionalty. Since the phases are crucially important , we\n\u221a\nexpect the amplitude of the fluctuations to decrease as 1/ N . This can easily be tested on an\n8\n\n\fexample of 3D Kolmogorov flow in a box with the side a driven by the force f = (0, 0, cos( Lx ))\nby varying the forcing scale.\nTo conclude: based on the equations of motion and some physical considerations, we\npropose a dynamic model, coupling vorticity (enstrophy) and energy fluctuations in a homogeneous shear flow. This model generates strongly correlated self-sustained oscillations\nof both enstrophy and energy similar to those observed in eperiments and direct numerical\nsimulations. The calculated time -lag is similar to that observed in a numerical study of 3D\nKolomogorov flow by Borue et al [14].\nIt is not yet clear if, properly parametrized, this simple model can mimic turbulent bursts\nwhich are at the core of the energy production in turbulent wall flows. In case of a positive\nanswer, the model of this kind can serve as a boundary condition (\"wall function\") for turbulence simulations, neglecting the detailed consideration of dynamics of the viscous sublayer.\nThe achieved computational economy makes this aspect of the work worth persuing.\nreferences\n1.
