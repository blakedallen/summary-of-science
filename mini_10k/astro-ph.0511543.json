If gravity obeys\nEinstein's General Relativity (GR), this means that the universe is currently dominated\nby a dark energy component, contributing about \u223c 70% to the critical energy density.\nTo fuel cosmic acceleration dark energy ought to have negative pressure, satisfying roughly\n< \u22122/3 to fit the observations [3, 4], if it is the only agent responsible for supernovae\nw = p/\u03c1 \u223c\n1\ndimming . Because dark energy would control both the present state of the universe and the\ncourse of its future evolution, it is extremely interesting and important to try to elucidate\nthe microscopic nature of dark energy.\nThe first step in this quest is to devise benchmark models which are useful to compare\nwith observations. Dark energy is usually modelled as a cosmological constant or as a timedependent quintessence field [7, 8, 9, 10]. Each must be finely tuned to fit the observations\n[11]. Even if we leave aside the mystery of tuning the vacuum energy to nearly zero, and\nassume that the current acceleration is due to a quintessence field, it is hard to build realistic\nmodels. Quintessence requires more fine tunings, over and above the scale of dark energy\ndensity: a tiny mass mQ smaller than the current Hubble parameter H0 \u223c 10\u221233 eV as well\nas sub-gravitational couplings to normal matter, to satisfy the Solar system gravity bounds\n[12]. This leaves but a few models which appear natural from the point of view of 4D\neffective field theory, in the sense that their masses and their couplings to the visible matter\nremain small in spite of the corrections arising in the loop expansion of quantum field theory.\nIn these models quintessence is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) [13, 14, 15, 16],\nwhich in perturbation theory has only naturally weak, derivative couplings to visible matter,\nprotected by a shift symmetry \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6 + C. Its potential, V = \u03bc4 [1 \u2212 cos(\u03c6/fa )] + . . ., and\nspecifically the mass term mQ \u2243 \u03bc2 /fa are generated by non-perturbative effects breaking\nthe shift symmetry to a discrete subgroup, and hence are radiatively stable [13, 14, 15, 16].\nIt is often quoted that to serve as quintessence, the pNGB models need a large decay\nconstant fa > MP l [13, 14]. The idea is that the dynamics of quintessence should be akin\nto chaotic inflation [17, 18, 19, 20] where a dynamical field impersonates dark energy if the\n> O(1)M\npotential admits a slow roll regime. However, for models where fa \u223c\nP l there will\ngenerically be higher order corrections to the pNGB potential, coming as higher harmonics\nin the expansion over the instanton contributions, which typically spoil the flatness of the\npotential [20, 21]. Although one may invent models where such large values of fa appear\nand the potential remains flat [20, 22, 23], it has been questioned whether they can come\nfrom fundamental theory, e.g string theory [21]. Even though higher order corrections might\nstill allow an e-fold or few of acceleration to unravel, which could be enough to account for\nobservations, this poses some challenges for model building.\n1\n\nSee [5, 6] for a recent analysis of the observational status of some alternatives.\n\n1\n\n\fWhat of pNGBs with smaller fa ? One might be tempted to try to squeeze some acceleration from them by arranging for the pNGB to dwell on, or near, a maximum of its\nnon-perturbatively generated potential. Of course this entails very special initial conditions\nfor the pNGB vev, namely its initial location on the potential peak. Also, one may try to use\nadditional, explicit PQ symmetry breaking terms to shift the vacuum energy, changing the\nLagrangian as in [24], which starts with the QCD axion and chooses fa \u223c 1012 GeV to argue\nthat the axion may be dark matter. However, in this case dark energy is really an explicit\ncosmological constant term, as opposed to a dynamical quintessence, and we have nothing\nnew to say about it. Note also that a pNGB with a mass ma \u223c 10\u221216 eV might weakly mix\nwith photons, inducing a conversion of light from distant supernovae in the extragalactic\nmagnetic fields, and thus also affect the observed supernovae dimming [25].\nIn this article we will review the dynamical constraints on the decay width fa needed\nfor pNGB to behave as quintessence. We will demonstrate that the simple estimates of fa\nbased on slow roll approximations are incomplete and somewhat misleading. The point is\nthat the slow roll can set in only when the field resides in the regions of positively curved\npotential, \u2202\u03c62 V > 0. This occurs only in the region between two potential inflections around\nthe minimum, which is broad enough to model the current epoch of cosmic acceleration if\n> O(1)M . However, for models where f < O(1)M , there is no region of the convex\nfa \u223c\nPl\na\nPl\npart of the potential where the slow roll condition \u2202\u03c6 V \u226a V /MP l holds. Even if the field\nstarts at the inflection, the restoring force \u223c \u2202\u03c6 V will be too large and pull it down very\n< fa H \u22121 . Thus to mimic dark energy for longer such a pNGB\nquickly, in time \u2206tinflation \u223c\n0\nMP l\nhad better start near a maximum. But in this region the pNGB is tachyonic. It grows\nexponentially, because its vev is sliding down the potential ridge. This tachyonic instability\n> O(1)M , extending the longevity of the dark energy epoch.\nis slow if fa \u223c\nPl\nWhen fa < O(1)MP l the instability develops much faster. Generically the pNGB will\nnot remain perched exactly on the top of the potential everywhere inside the horizon even\nif it had started there, because it will get displaced by quantum fluctuations during early\ncosmological inflation. The amplitude of these fluctuations sets the scale of the minimum\ninitial displacement from the quintessence maximum, which will be of the order of the early\n< 1013 GeV. For a given f < O(1)M\ninflation Hubble scale, HI \u223c\na\nP l the field will roll down\nthe slope fast. Suppressing this for long enough is what places a strong bound on fa of\nquintessence pNGB in this case. Further, the perturbations imprinted in the pNGB dark\nenergy during early inflation will grow due to the tachyonic instability, and may lead to\npotentially observable large wavelength perturbations in the dark sector. In addition, since\n< O(1)M , the dark\nthe pNGB vev will change in the course of cosmic evolution when fa \u223c\nPl\nenergy equation of state will vary [16], possibly even leading to an increased rate of cosmic\nacceleration at late times [26, 27], and yielding increased supernovae dimming at small\nredshifts. This offers a novel possibility of correlating a variation of w(z) with the dark\nenergy perturbations.\nFinally, we will also point out that pNGB dynamics could still accommodate the present\nepoch of cosmic acceleration even if fa < MP l \u2013 if there are several pNGB fields. The\nmechanism which lends to this is a scaled-down assisted inflation [28], whose high energy\nvariant may emerge from string theory [29]. This can ameliorate some of the concerns about\nthe possibility of embedding pNGB quintessence with fa \u226b MP l in fundamental theory\n[20, 21]. Instead of a single field pNGB quintessence, one may be able to use several fields\n2\n\n\fwith fa < O(1)MP l to dominate the universe today. Such models may actually lead to\na number of observational signatures that could be explored by the future probes of dark\nenergy.\nLet us first briefly review the cosmology of pNGBs. The low energy dynamics of a pNGB\nis given by the Lagrangian (with the (\u2212, +, +, +) metric convention)\n\u0010\n\u03c6 \u0011\n1\nL = \u2212 (\u2207\u03c6)2 \u2212 \u03bc4 1 \u2212 cos( ) + . . . .\n2\nfa\n\n(1)\n\nThe ellipsis in Eq. (1) stands for the higher order corrections from the instantons as well as\npossible higher derivative terms. For now, we will ignore them. In an FRW geometry, the\nhomogeneous pNGB mode obeys the field equation\n\u03c6\u0308 + 3H \u03c6\u0307 + \u2202\u03c6 V = 0 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere H = \u0227/a is the Hubble parameter and a the FRW scale factor. If the pNGB is in the\nslow roll regime, such that its potential energy dominates its kinetic energy, V > 12 (\u2202\u03c6)2 , and\nthe restoring force in (2) is overwhelmed by the cosmological friction term, \u2202\u03c62 V < 9H 2 /4,\nthe cosmological dynamics is dominated by the potential, yielding cosmic acceleration.\nNaively this seems to occur when pNGB is displaced away from the minimum\u221aof the\npotential to \u03c6 \u2243 fa (modulo 2\u03c0fa ), such that H 2 \u2243 O(1)\u03bc4 /MP2 l (we use MP l = 1/ 8\u03c0GN\n> O(1)M\nthroughout) and \u2202\u03c62 V \u2243 \u03bc4 /fa2 , suggesting that as long as fa \u223c\nP l the slow roll regime\nmay set in [13]. The scale of inflation driven by pNGB depends on the scale \u03bc generated by\nnon-perturbative symmetry breaking [13, 14, 19, 20, 23], and so to generate a sufficiently long\n< 10\u221233 eV,\nepoch of cosmic acceleration today one must require \u03bc \u223c 10\u22123 eV, such that mQ \u223c\nas mentioned above.\nHowever this argument is a bit too quick. Slow roll regime may only occur if the potential\nis convex [17, 18]. Hence the field should be within the interval around the minimum bounded\nby the two adjacent inflexion points. In this regime, the slow roll condition MP l \u2202\u03c6 V /V \u226a 1\ngives\nMP l sin (\u03c6/fa )\n\u226a1.\n(3)\nfa 1 \u2212 cos (\u03c6/fa )\nIf we restrict ourselves to the region for which V (\u03c6) is convex, the left hand side of the\nabove equation attains its minimum at the inflexion points \u03c6inf lection = \u03c0 fa /2 \u00b1 n \u03c0 fa .\nThere, its value is MP l /fa , so that one can hope to realize slow roll only if fa is larger than\nMP l . Otherwise, the restoring force \u223c \u2202\u03c6 V will pull the pNGB down to the minimum\nof the potential too quickly. Indeed: although the curvature of the potential in (1) is\n4\n\u2202\u03c62 V = \u03bcf 2 cos(\u03c6/fa ), and it is dominated by friction near the inflections, the potential is well\na\napproximated by the linear term V \u2243 \u03bc4 (1 \u2212 \u2206\u03c6/fa ) there. Soon after the field is released\n\u221a\nfrom an initial position near the inflection, its velocity saturates at \u03c6\u0307 \u2243 \u2212\u03bc2 MP l /( 3fa ),\nso that the kinetic energy of the field is comparable to its potential unless fa > MP l . This\nwill happen after the vev of the field moves by \u223c fa . Approximating the field acceleration\nby \u03c6\u0308 \u223c \u2212\u03bc4 /fa , we can estimate the duration of an inflating phase in this case to be\n< fa , or therefore\n\u2206tinflation \u223c\n\u03bc2\nfa\n<\n\u2206tinflation \u223c\nH \u22121 .\n(4)\nMP l 0\n3\n\n\f> M .\nThus this regime will not last long enough unless fa \u223c\nPl\nWhat happens if the pNGB field starts near the potential maxima? Clearly for as long as\nit sits precisely at the maximum, it would behave exactly like a cosmological constant. If such\na state were very long lived, it may be able to imitate dark energy even if fa < MP l . Getting\nit up there clearly exacerbates fine tuning. However one should first develop the means for\nquantifying the degree of such fine tunings. One might even be able to justify a special value\nof the pNGB vev dynamically: e.g. in the early universe before inflation the pNGB was a flat\ndirection, and so it could have fluctuated a great deal. Its vev could have assumed any values,\nmostly away from the value required to mimic cosmological constant, \u03c6 = (\u03c0 + 2n\u03c0)fa for\nsome integer n. However, the required field vevs may have been attained in some regions of\nthe meta-universe simply because of continuity, and then frozen-in by early inflation. When\nthe pNGB potential is generated later on, this region acquires a small vacuum energy in the\npNGB sector. So we may just happen to live in one such domain \u2013 inside a pNGB domain\nwall \u2013 expanded to tremendous sizes by inflation. Similar mechanisms are also used as a\ncatalyst of chaotic inflation [17] or topological inflation [31].\nThe problems with such arguments arise when one considers dynamics. If the initial vev\nstarts inside an interval of width \u03c0fa centered at maxima at (\u03c0 + 2n\u03c0)fa and bounded by\nthe adjacent potential inflexions, the pNGB is a tachyon: near its maxima the curvature of\nthe potential is negative. The pNGB wants to slide off of the peak of the potential, and its\nvev depends exponentially on time. When fa < MP l , this time variation is fast: the field\nchanges exponentially in a Hubble time. Hence in this regime, the field is never in slow roll\nin the strict sense, and the epoch of dark energy domination will quickly cease. This is really\nthe main reason that pNGB quintessence models work better with large fa , as we will now\nelaborate.\nTo illustrate this, we can solve the field equation (2) by approximating the potential as\n\nV =\n\n(\n\n2\u03bc4 \u2212 21 m2 (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6max )2 + . . . , for\n1 2\nm (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6min )2 + . . . ,\n2\n\n\u03c6max \u2212 \u03c0fa /2 < \u03c6 < \u03c6max + \u03c0fa /2 ;\n\u03c6min \u2212 \u03c0fa /2 < \u03c6 < \u03c6min + \u03c0fa /2 .\n\n(5)\n\nHere \u03c6max = (\u03c0 + 2n\u03c0)fa for some integer n, whereas \u03c6min is a minimum adjacent to it,\nwhere pNGB wants to settle in, and where we have defined\nm2 \u2261 |\u2202\u03c62 V (\u03c6extrema )| =\n\n\u03bc4\n.\nfa2\n\n(6)\n\nThe corrections to the potential (5), denoted by the ellipses, are small away from the inflections, but become important near them since they are smoothing the potential towards\nthe exact cosine form. Nevertheless the corrections do not significantly alter the qualitative\naspects of the conclusions and so we can ignore them for the most part. Now, if the vev\nis initially displaced from a maximum \u03c6max to \u03c6i = (\u03c0/2 + n\u03c0)fa + \u03c60 , where 0 6= \u03c60 < fa\nso that \u2202\u03c62 V < 0, and if the pNGB sector dominates the universe, the dynamics will be\nq\n\nwell approximated by \u03c6\u0308 + 3H \u03c6\u0307 \u2212 m2 \u03c6 = 0, with H = 2/3\u03bc2 /MP l \u2243 const, with solutions\n\u221a\n\u03c6 \u221d exp(\u03b1\u00b1 t) where \u03b1\u00b1 = [\u22123H \u00b1 9H 2 + 4m2 ]/2. The leading order late time behavior\nis dominated by the growing, tachyonic mode \u03c6 \u221d exp(\u03b1+ t). The power \u03b1+ depends on the\n\n4\n\n\fratio of H/m \u2243 fa /MP l , being2\n\u03b1+ \u2243\n\n(\n\nm,\nm2\n3H\n\n< O(1)M\nfa \u223c\nPl ;\nfa > O(1)MP l .\n\nfor\n,\n\n(7)\n\n> 1/\u03b1\nIn either case, if the field had started at \u03c6i with vanishing velocity, then at a time t \u223c\n+\nits vev will have moved to approximately\n\n\u03c6(t) \u2243 \u03c6max +\n\n1\n\u03c60 e\u03b1+ t + . . . .\n2\n\n(8)\n\nOnce the total displacement at a time t becomes of order fa , \u2206\u03c6(t) \u2243 12 \u03c60 e\u03b1+ t \u223c fa , the\nfield will have approached the inflections of the potential, where the corrections omitted in\n(5) become important.\nThe effective mass m2ef f = \u2202\u03c62 V changes along the approach to the inflection, eventually\nvanishing there. Nevertheless the kinetic energy the field accumulated on the approach and\nthe restoring force, \u221d \u2202\u03c6 V 6= 0 there, will push the pNGB through the inflection, ensuring\nthat it does not stop there. By this time the field velocity reaches \u03c6\u0307 \u2243 \u03b1+ \u2206\u03c6(t) \u2243 \u03b1+ fa ,\n2 2\nand so the kinetic energy becomes \u03c6\u03072 \u2243 \u03b1+\nfa . Depending on the ratio H/m \u2243 fa /MP l the\nfield may stop to behave as vacuum energy by this moment. Indeed, the equation of state\n2\nparameter w(t), defined as w(t) = \u03c6\u0307\u03c6\u03072 /2\u2212V\nduring this epoch grows in time approximately as\n/2+V\nw(t) \u2243 \u22121 +\n\n1 \u0010 \u03b1+ \u2206\u03c6(t) \u00112\n+ ... ,\n2\n\u03bc2\n\n(9)\n\nso that by the time \u2206\u03c6(t) \u223c fa , the parameter w becomes\nwend \u2243 \u22121 +\n\n1 \u0010 \u03b1+ \u00112\n+ ... .\n2 m\n\n(10)\n\nNote that if m/\u03b1+ \u2243 O(1), or equivalently fa < O(1)MP l (7), w will move significantly up\nfrom \u22121 by this time, and in this case cosmic acceleration will cease as the pNGB arrives at\nthe inflection.\nAfter the inflection, the field dynamics is well described by \u03c6\u0308 + 3H \u03c6\u0307 + m2 \u03c6 = 0. What\n> M\n<\nhappens to it depends sensitively on the magnitude fa . If fa \u223c\nP l so that m \u223c H,\nfrom (10) it is clear that by the time the field passes through the inflection the universe\n> M\nis still accelerating (albeit marginally for m \u223c H). By virtue of fa \u223c\nP l the field next\nencounters a sufficiently broad swath of convex and almost flat potential plateau, where\nit will in fact dissipate at least some of its kinetic energy acquired during the initial fast\nroll stage, somewhat prolonging the phase of acceleration. In the converse case fa < MP l ,\nEq. (10) shows that the cosmic acceleration has all but stopped. In this case the potential\nplateau which follows the inflection is too narrow to slow the field down. Due to its kinetic\nenergy, comparable to the potential at inflection, the field will zoom by, yielding only a\nsmall fraction of an e-fold. In either case, eventually the field will begin to oscillate around\nthe minimum of (5), obeying a well known asymptotic attractor solution given by H \u2243 3t2 ,\n2\n\nNotice that the slow roll approximation would yield \u03c6 \u221d exp (\u03b1t), with \u03b1 = m2 /3H, that corresponds\nto a good approximation of the correct result (7) only in the case fa > O(1)MP l .\n\n5\n\n\f\u03c6 = \u03c6min + A cos(mt + \u03b4)/a3/2 .

Depending on the scales however, it may yet occur that\nafter the first pass through the minimum the field continues to climb up the potential past\nthe inflection on the opposite side. In that case, the field would yield another short burst of\ninflation as it slowly climbs the opposite slope, before returning to oscillations around the\nminimum. The possibility of having inflation briefly start again after the passage through\nthe minimum has been considered earlier in relation to the cosmological moduli problem\n[32]. Such dynamics could simulate the behavior of dark energy with w < \u22121, as recently\ndiscussed in [26, 27].\nTo summarize this discussion, we see that a universe controlled by a pNGB may first\nundergo a stage of inflation during which the field changes quickly, akin to the fast-roll\n> M ) or may not (for f < O(1)M ) be followed by\ninflation of [33], which may (for fa \u223c\nPl\na\nPl\na stage of slow roll inflation, and then eventually end up like a universe dominated by an\n< O(1)M\noscillating massive scalar field. If m/\u03b1+ \u2243 O(1), or therefore fa \u223c\nP l (7), cosmic\nacceleration will come to a close by the time the pNGB vev gets to the inflection. In this\ncase the duration of the accelerating epoch is fully controlled by the coefficient \u03b1+ \u223c m (see\nEq. (7)) and the initial displacement from the maximum,\n\u2206t \u223c\n\n1 \u0010 fa \u0011\n.\nln\nm\n\u03c60\n\n(11)\n\nIf a single pNGB is to mimic dark energy today, \u2206t must be of the order of the current age\nof the universe, \u223c 1/H0 . To ensure this the initial displacement of the pNGB vev away from\nthe potential maximum should be no more than\n\u03c60\n\nmax\n\n\u223c fa e\u2212m/H0 \u223c fa e\u2212MP l /fa ,\n\n(12)\n\nto ensure that the universe is accelerating now.\n> M . By\nHerein lies the problem: the condition \u03c60 < \u03c60 max will not hold unless fa \u223c\nPl\nits very definition, pNGB couplings are very weak and its potential, generated by nonperturbative effects, is very flat3 , compared to a typical scale of early inflation. Therefore\nduring early inflation which shaped our universe and generated primordial perturbations, the\npNGB field is relativistic, with \u2202\u03c62 V \u226a HI2 . Hence like any relativistic field during inflation\nit must have fluctuated a lot around its mean value. Its dynamics was stochastic [18, 34]:\nimagine that in some region of the early universe the pNGB vev did attain exactly the value\ncorresponding to the maximum of the potential in (1), \u03c6 = (\u03c0 + 2n\u03c0)fa , when inflation\nstarted. Because it is dynamical and relativistic, the field subsequently gets displaced by the\nquantum fluctuations generated in de Sitter environment [18, 34, 35, 36]. It \"wiggled\" a little\ninside the inflating region from one Hubble time to another. The scale of these quantum\nfluctuations is given by the root mean square value of the field around its expectation value,\nset by the two point function of a relativistic quantum field in de Sitter space [18, 34, 36]:\n2\n\n< \u03c6 (t) > =\n3\n\n\u0010 H \u00112 Z\nI\n\n2\u03c0\n\nHI\n\nHI e\u2212HI t\n\nd3~k\n.\nk\n\n(13)\n\nIn fact at energies above the scale of shift symmetry breaking, there is no potential for pNGB at all.\n\n6\n\n\fFrom this, the jump of the field between two subsequent Hubble intervals is\n\u03b4\u03c6 \u2243\n\nHI\n.\n2\u03c0\n\n(14)\n\nThe constraints on fa when it is smaller than O(1)MP l , derive from this. While dependent\non the scale of early inflation, they are nevertheless useful. If the field is initially displaced\nby \u223c HI /2\u03c0 (14), due to the tachyonic instability it will slide off the maximum in time \u2206t\n> 1/H . Thus we find\ngiven by (11). If this is to yield enough late cosmic acceleration, \u2206t \u223c\n0\n\u0010 2\u03c0f \u0011\na\n< f ln\nMP l \u223c\n,\na\nHI\n\n(15)\n\nwhere we used (6) and H0 \u223c \u03bc2 /MP l . The inequality (15) implies that the logarithm ranges\nbetween \u223c 15 and \u223c 36 for the range of HI from about 1013 GeV down to about 104 GeV ,\nwhich cover many generic inflationary models including chaotic inflation [17] and hybrid\ninflation [37], its supergravity realizations [38] and modern hybrid inflation models on the\nstring landscape [39]. Using (15) we can estimate that fa must be greater than about a tenth\nof MP l if pNGB is to mimic dark energy today:\n> 0.1 \u00d7 M .\nfa \u223c\nPl\n\n(16)\n\nIn fact, numerical considerations show that the bound is even stronger by a factor of a few.\nIn Figure 1 we plot the current value of the equation of state parameter of the pNGB,\nas a function of its initial value \u03c60 and of fa /MP l . Current observations relegate the allowed\npart of parameter space to the top right corner of the figure, and \u2013 barring fine tuned initial\nconditions \u2013 a typical bound on fa reads fa > 0.2 MP l , to fit the observations. We should\nremark, here, that the boundary between the forbidden light-colored region and the allowed\ndarker one is not as sharp as it appears on the plot. Indeed, for values of \u03c60 and fa close\nto the boundary, we have regions where the pNGB has performed a half oscillation around\nthe minimum before the present time, and has been recently climbing its potential4 . In such\ncases, the initial potential energy of the field starting near the maximum does not dissipate as\nquickly, and they swing past the minimum beyond the opposite inflection, where they linger\na little on the potential. The study of the viability of these regions is more complicated, as\nthe full time dependence of the parameter w(a) should be taken into account in this case,\nalong the lines of [40]. These regions could actually provide a better fit to supernova data,\nmimicking w < \u22121 [26, 27].\nWe can thus conclude that models where fa < 0.1 MP l are extremely fine-tuned: to\nget a pNGB to mimic dark energy when fa fails to satisfy (15) one needs extreme fine\ntunings of the initial state of the pNGB. The field must start in a special state where the\nsubsequent quantum fluctuations precisely cancel against the prearranged initial dark energy\ninhomogeneities. This is extremely unlikely, and goes against the grain of the standard\n4\n\nThese regions are not represented in Figure 1, because in the plot we have computed the value of w at\nthe moment in which \u03a9matter crosses the value 0.3 for the first time. In the \"forbidden\" region, the value\nof w is larger than \u22120.7 when this first crossing happens. But for values close to the boundary between the\nallowed and the forbidden region, \u03a9matter actually performs small oscillations around the value 0.3, while\nthe equation of state parameter w of the pNGB oscillates between \u22121 and 1.\n\n7\n\n\finflationary lore. In inflation, such special features of the initial state would be erased\nby exponential expansion, and the subsequent structure would be imprinted by quantum\nfluctuations, leading to (15) for pNGBs with fa < MP l .\nIf we parameterize the end of inflation by picking a spacelike surface along which the\nadiabatic perturbations generated during inflation are \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1 \u2243 10\u22125 , we will find that the\ndistribution of the vevs of the pNGB field is also slightly inhomogeneous, given by an approx> 1/H and with the field perturbation estimated\nimately scale invariant spectrum at scales \u223c\nI\nby, roughly, Eq. (14). These perturbations of the pNGB vev will remain frozen until the\nhorizon reentry at a much later time. They will yield small initial perturbations of the dark\nenergy density,\n\u03b4\u03c1DE\n\u03b4V\nHI2\n(17)\n\u2243\n\u2243 2 2,\n\u03c1DE\nV\n8\u03c0 fa\nwhere we assume that the field was initially exactly on top of the potential. In evaluating\nthe last line of (17) we have used (6). If \u03c6 started off farther from the maximum, the\nperturbations would be larger,\n\u03b4\u03c1DE\nHI\n\u2243\n.\n(18)\n\u03c1DE\n2\u03c0fa\nInitially, the dark energy perturbation may be very small. For a typical inflationary model\n< 1013 GeV, if the pNGB decay width is large, f > M , the initial dark energy\nwith HI \u223c\na \u223c\nPl\n< 10\u221214 \u2212 10\u22127 , subsequently slowly growing in time, as\nperturbation would be \u03b4\u03c1DE /\u03c1DE \u223c\nthe pNGB slides off the maximum. When fa < O(1)MP l , however, the perturbation would\nboth be initially larger and would grow faster. Indeed, in regions of the postinflationary\nuniverse where inflation displaced pNGB away from the maximum by \u223c HI the late stage\nof acceleration driven by the pNGB would terminate faster than in those regions where the\nfield remained perched on top of the potential. Such models can develop large perturbations\nat late times in the dark sector, because the initially small dark energy density perturbations\nwill grow as pNGB slides down the potential 5 . Even if they start as small as (17) or (18),\nby the time the field approaches the potential inflection, \u2206\u03c6 \u2192 fa , the perturbations will\nincrease according to\n\u03b4\u03c1DE end \u0010 \u2206\u03c6(\u2206t) \u00112\n\u2243\n\u2192 O(1) ,\n(19)\n\u03c1DE end\nfa\n\nincreasing as fa drops below MP l . Thus the dark energy perturbations could in principle\ngrow to become sufficiently large today to compete with the inflationary perturbations at\nlarge scales. We expect that these dark energy perturbations would yield isocurvature perturbations at very large scales and very late times, and the mechanism would be akin to the\ncurvaton mechanism of [42]. While here we will refrain from a detailed computation of the\nspectrum and evolution of dark energy perturbations, we note that such a study has been\nperformed on pre-WMAP data in [43] (a previous study of this issue can be found in [44],\nwhere the authors, however, focused only on the special value fa = MP l ). The constraints\nfound in [43] are weaker than the ones imposed by supernovae. The reason, roughly, is that\nduring inflation structure grows slowly, and hence the perturbations remain frozen until the\nend of the accelerating epoch. An analysis that includes the more accurate WMAP data\n5\n\nFor some choice of parameters, the fluctuations might backreact on the evolution of the zero mode of\nthe pNGB [41], affecting its equation of state.\n\n8\n\n\fmay help reducing the available portion of the parameter space,6 although it should also be\n7\n> O(1)M\nclear that if fa \u223c\nP l such effects may remain small . The possibility of generating\nand observing the imprints of early inflation in dark energy has been recently discussed in\nmore general terms in [47].\n> O(1)M\nThese arguments show that the pNGB quintessence models need fa \u223c\nP l to be\nviable. How could such models arise from fundamental theory, given the problems so far\nwith deriving large fa in string theory [20, 21]? In fact, there is a simple way to provide\nfor this using pNGBs with fa < O(1)MP l , if there is many of them8 . It is based on the\nmechanism of assisted inflation [28, 29]. Imagine that there are N copies of a pNGB with\nfa < O(1)MP l , which interact with each other via gravity. Then the total Lagrangian of the\nsystem is the sum of N copies of (1). Assume for simplicity that all the fields are displaced\naway from the minimum by the same amount. In that case, we can introduce a collective\ncoordinate\n\u221a\n(20)\n\u03c6 = N\u03c6,\nwhose effective potential is given by\n\u0010\n\nVef f = N \u03bc4 1 \u2212 cos( \u221a\n\n\u0011\n\u03c6\n) .\nN fa\n\n(21)\n\nThus we see that the collective coordinate \u03c6 behaves as a single pNGB with a potential\ncontrolled by the symmetry breaking scale \u03bcef f and decay width fef f\n\u03bcef f = N 1/4 \u03bc ,\nfef f = N 1/2 fa .\n\n(22)\n\nTherefore the total vacuum energy and the effective mass analogous to (6) for the collective\nmode \u03c6 are\n\u03bbef f = N \u03bc4 = N \u03bb ,\nm2\nN \u03bc4\n=\n.\nm2ef f =\nN 2 fa2\nN\n\n(23)\n\nWe can therefore approximate the potential for \u03c6 with an expression just like (5), where we\nreplace \u03bc, m and fa by \u03bcef f , mef f and fef f given in (22), (23). The analysis of the cosmological dynamics controlled by the collective mode \u03c6 then is the same as the investigation\nof the cosmology dominated by a zero mode of a single field \u03c6, and we see that by virtue of\nEqs. (22), (23) the duration of the epochs of dark energy is prolonged. If the field \u03c6 starts\nbelow the inflection, where the potential is convex, the duration of the slow roll regime is\napproximately the same one that we would find in a simple quadratic potential. Indeed, the\nfield \u03c6 will be slowly rolling until its vev is at a distance of the order of the Planck mass\n6\n\nSee [45, 46] for an interesting discussion of the possibility that such perturbations might play a role in\nexplaining the observed lack of power in low-l CMB multipoles.\n7\n> O(1)M\nWhen fa \u223c\nP l the pNGB vev will change more slowly in a Hubble time \u223c 1/H0 , and also the\nfield need not start from the maximum of the potential.\n8\nWe exploit the possibility of having many pNGBs with couplings which differ from each other, in contrast\nto the case of two pNGBs of [22] where an accidental symmetry relating axion couplings was used to generate\na large fef f .\n\n9\n\n\f2\n2\nfrom the minimum of V (\u03c6). The total number of e-folds will be N \u2243 fef\nf /MP l \u223c N , which\nwe can again estimate using the formula relating the number of e-folds N and the field vev\nfor a polynomial potential V \u223c \u03bb\u03c6n /n, N = (\u03c62 \u2212 \u03c620 )/(2nMP2 l ) [17, 18, 30]. Assuming\nN > (MP l /fa )2 we can approximate the potential by the quadratic term, as opposed to the\nlinear potential as in the case leading to Eq. (4). This yields\n\n\u2206t\u03c6\n\nroll\n\n\u223c\n\n2\nfef\nfa2\nf\n\u22121\nH\n\u223c\nN\nH \u22121 .\nMP2 l 0\nMP2 l 0\n\n(24)\n\nNotice that this is the regime considered, in the context of primordial inflation, in [29].\nLikewise, the tachyonic instability is also slowed down. When N > MP2 l /fa2 so that fef f >\nMP l , the value of \u03b1+ in Eq. (7) is now given by \u03b1+ \u2243 m2ef f /3H, and so the Eq.

But now even if fa /MP l < 1, as long\nf /MP l e-folds to get \u221a\nas there are many pNGBs such that N fa /MP l > 1, a full e-fold of acceleration or more\nmay ensue.\nObviously it is important that the pNGBs are not directly mutually interacting. Direct\ninteractions are detrimental to the effect of assisted inflation, which can be seen very simply\nfrom the following argument. The effect of assisting works by taking a given potential of\nfixed curvature and then prolonging the epoch of dark energy supported by this potential by\ntaking N degenerate copies [28]. If the direct interactions are then turned on, they will lift\nthe degeneracies of the mass spectrum of the fields. Some fields will be lighter, but most will\nget heavier. This is akin to a generic effect of mass splitting of a degenerate quantum system\nunder a perturbation. Hence, in spite of a large number of fields, some of them will become\nso heavy under the interactions that they will not be able to stay on the potential ridge,\nand will tumble down. However, it may be possible to ensure that the mutual interactions\nare miniscule by arranging for the right compactification of string theory, where pNGBs are\naxion-like degrees of freedom present in the moduli space, along the lines of [29]. A version\nof such a mechanism with very low mass scales may find its home in the landscape of string\nsolutions.\nOur argument that many copies of pNGBs prolong the epoch of dark energy relative to\na single one is clearly sensitive on the initial conditions for the individual pNGBs in the\nearly universe. The assisted dynamics works best if the pNGBs start out at roughly the\nsame place, away from the minimum of the potential, where they hold each other up on\nthe potential slope. In general, however, the effective field \u03c6 will have some width, since\nthe pNGBs may start at a different place. Further, they may also have slightly different\neffective masses (even if their \u03bc and fa are all the same, the effective mass is determined by\nthe curvature of the potential and hence depends on the position of the field). Because of\nthis, the field \u03c6 will eventually begin to fall apart in the course of evolution, and this will\nshorten the dark energy epoch and may lead to a new source of dark energy perturbations.\nWhile it is obvious that tuning the initial values of the separate pNGBs will hold this under\ncontrol, it would be interesting to revisit this issue in more detail.\n\n10\n\n\fFinally, let us comment on the idea that the pNGBs might have so extended a spectrum\nof masses and couplings that some of them contribute to dark energy today while others have\nalready been oscillating for a long time around the minimum of their potential, behaving in\neffect as dark matter. In this scenario, dark matter and dark energy would share a common\norigin, a fact that might help with the coincidence problem. We find that such mechanisms\nare hard to implement naturally in a simple setting. To illustrate these difficulties, consider\nthe simplest case of two pNGBs and ask that one of them (with parameters \u03bc1 and f1 ) be\ndark matter, while the other (\u03bc2 , f2 ) be dark energy. The first pNGB will start rolling along\nits potential when the q\nHubble parameter \u223c T 2 /MP l equals its mass \u03bc21 /f1 . This happens at\na temperature T1 \u223c \u03bc1 MP l /f1 . The pNGB subsequently evolves as matter, so that\n\u03c11 \u2243\n\n\u03bc41\n\n\u0012\n\nT\nT1\n\n\u00133\n\n,\n\n(26)\n\nand it starts dominating the energy density of the Universe at the temperature Te \u223c 1 eV\nof matter-raidation equality. We thus find the relation \u03bc1 \u2243 Te (MP l /f1 )3/2 . By requiring\nT1 > Te , we get f1 < MP l , that implies \u03bc1 > Te . The parameters of the second pNGB are\ndetermined by the requirement the it is dark energy today: \u03bc2 \u2243 10\u22124 Te , f2 \u2243 MP l . To\nsolve the coincidence problem, one would need to relate the two pNGBs in some natural\nway, requiring that their mass scales and couplings \u03bck , fk are related by a common new\nphysics at some new scale \u039b. Parameterizing this relationship by a simple power law, so\n\u03b2\nthat \u03bc1,2 = \u039b1\u2212\u03b2 f1,2\n, we get the relation\n(f1 /MP l )3/2+\u03b2 = 104 .\n\n(27)\n\nAs f1 < MP l , \u03b2 has to be negative, and \u03bc should be thus inversely proportional to some\npower of f . Typically models of pNGB have the opposite behavior, and so this would require\nsome complicated and unusual construction to reproduce the desired spectrum of pNGBs,\npursuit of which is beyond the present work.\nTo recapitulate: we have revisited models where dark energy is dynamical, controlled by\n> O(1)M , models with a single, or very few,\na pNGB field. We have stressed that unless fa \u223c\nPl\npNGB(s) are not good explanations of the present epoch of dark energy domination because\nof the tachyonic instability plaguing most of the field initial values. Even if the field starts out\nvery close to a maximum of its potential, because it is so light quantum fluctuations during\nearly inflation will shift it away from the maximum by an amount proportional to the Hubble\nscale of inflation HI . This would exacerbate the fine tuning problems of dark energy. Given\nthe concerns raised about embedding pNGB models with fa > MP l in fundamental theory\n[20, 21] on the one hand, and the acute absence of technically natural models of quintessence\non the other [20, 12], this may present a challenge for building dark energy models within\nthe realm of effective field theory consistent with fundamental theory. We have noted that\na possible solution of this problem can be developed by scaling down the mechanism of\nassisted inflation [28, 29] to very low scales. If there are several ultralight pNGBs, they may\ndrive very late epoch of cosmic acceleration together even if their individual decay constants\nsatisfy fa < MP l . We should note that although the assisted inflation idea does not seem\nto help other quintessence models [48], it works well for pNGBs. If quintessence is really\nan admixture of many modes, its decay may leave signatures in the form of inhomogeneities\n11\n\n\fof dark energy distributions. These inhomogeneities are triggered by quantum fluctuations\nduring early inflation, just as the primordial density perturbations, and ultimately baby\nuniverses in self-reproducing inflationary models [34]. Thus in some sense such perturbations\nmay carry information about the cosmic seeds, frozen in the cosmic permafrost that is dark\nenergy. It would be interesting to carry out more precise calculations of the amplitude\nof these perturbations and check their observational consequences, since they may affect\ncosmological anisotropies at the largest of scales [45, 46]. Further, in such models dark\nenergy dynamics may also result in a variable equation of state w(z), which could account for\nadditional dimming of supernovae at low redshifts [26, 27], warranting coordinated searches\nfor w \u2032 and for dark energy perturbations.\nFinally, we cannot refrain from reminiscing about one other question, often heard in the\nfield of dark energy: namely, \"Who ordered this?\". The pNGB quintessence models strive\nto be natural in the sense of effective field theory, since the scales and couplings governing\n< O(1)M ,\ntheir dynamics are radiatively stable. However the pNGB dark energy with fa \u223c\nPl\nwhich were a central subject of this study, do not appear all that natural or simple from\nthe point of view Occam's razor, a criterion often employed to justify or belittle a model of\ndark energy. The oft-quoted versions of Occam's razor are commonly extrapolated to imply\nthat dark energy may be the simplest of possibilities: a cosmological constant. Yet this is\na heuristic argument that does not necessarily give correct answers. It is merely a loose\nguide enabling one to pick a scientific hypothesis based on the fewest currently unproven\nassumptions. To fully accept arguments based on simplicity and Occam's razor, we need\nto go beyond na\u00efve and develop a complete theory of the dark sector, that goes beyond\nthe taxonomy of cosmic coincidences [10]. Before we have it, we may be dismissing ideas\ntoo quickly. The appearance of simplicity may be deceiving, as witnessed by a dearth of\ncomplete theories of vacuum energy. Just putting a number \u03bb in the equations is merely\na fit. The pNGB quiN tessence models are motivated by an attempt to simultaneously\naddress two theoretical issues: (1) protect the ultra-low scales of quintessence from radiative\ncorrections involving the rest of the world9 , and (2) derive ultra-weakly coupled pNBG-like\nfields, simulating fef f > MP l , from fundamental theory. If it so happens that such models\nbring about a number of observational consequences worth studying, all the better. Similar\nopinions about Occam's razor have been expressed before on numerous occasions (see [49]\nfor a nice summary). We end by quoting one such example:\n\"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,\nThan are dreamt of in your philosophy.\"\nWilliam Shakespeare, Hamlet\nWhether or not it applies to our world remains to be seen.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank A.
