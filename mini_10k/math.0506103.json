This construction\nis generalized to arbitrary differential operators on a smooth fiber bundle. Namely, if a certain\nnecessary and sufficient condition holds, one can associate to a differential operator the exact\nchain complex with the boundary operator whose nilpotency restarts all the Noether identities\ncharacterizing the degeneracy of an original differential operator.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nGiven a generic Lagrangian system on a fiber bundle, its Euler\u2013Lagrange operator E obeys\nthe Noether identities. They need not be independent, but satisfy the first-stage Noether\nidentities, which in turn are subject to the second-order Noether ones, and so on. The\nhierarchy of these Noether identities characterizes the degeneracy of a Lagrangian system\nin full. Noether's second theorem states the relation between Noether identities and gauge\nsymmetries of a Lagrangian [1, 2], but Noether identities can be introduced without regarding E as an Euler\u2013Lagrange operator. Therefore, one can extend the notion of Noether\nidentities to a generic differential operator on a fiber bundle. Our goal is the following.\nLet Y \u2192 X be a smooth fiber bundle and J r Y , r = 1, . . . , the jet manifolds of its sections\n(the index r = 0 further stands for Y ). Let E \u2192 X be a vector bundle. A E-valued r-order\ndifferential operator E on Y is conventionally defined as a bundle morphism of J r Y to E\nover X [3, 4]. We associate to E the chain complex (10) whose boundaries vanish on Ker E\n(Proposition 2). It is a complex of a certain ring S\u221e [E; Y ] of Grassmann-graded functions\nand their jets on the infinite order jet manifold J \u221e Y of Y . For our purpose, this complex\ncan be replaced with the short zero-exact complex S\u221e [E; Y ]\u22642 (11). Recall that a chain\ncomplex is called r-exact if its homology of degree k \u2264 r is trivial.\nNoether identities of a differential operator E are defined as nontrivial elements of the\nfirst homology H1 (\u03b4) of the complex (11) (Definition 3). If this homology is finitely generated, the complex (11) can be extended to the one exact-complex P\u221e [E; Y ; E0 ]\u22643 (19) with\nthe boundary operator \u03b40 (18) whose nilpotency conditions are equivalent to the abovementioned Noether identities (Proposition 4). First-stage Noether identities are defined\nas two-cycles of this complex. They are trivial if two-cycles are boundaries, but the converse need not be true. Trivial first-stage Noether identities are boundaries iff a certain\nhomology condition (called the two-homology regularity condition) holds (Proposition 6).\nIn this case, the first-stage Noether identities are identified to nontrivial elements of the\n1\n\n\fsecond homology of the complex (19). If this homology is finitely generated, the complex\n(19) is extended to the two-exact complex P\u221e [E1 E; Y ; E0 ]\u22644 (30) with the boundary operator \u03b41 (29) whose nilpotency conditions are equivalent to the Noether and first-stage\nNoether identities (Proposition 8). If the third homology of this complex is not trivial, the\nsecond-stage Noether identities exist, and so on. Iterating the arguments, we come to the\nfollowing.\nLet we have the (N + 1)-exact complex P\u221e {N}\u2264N +3 (33) such that: (i) the nilpotency\nconditions of its boundary operator \u03b4N (31) reproduce Noether and k-stage Noether identities for k \u2264 N, (ii) the (N + 1)-homology regularity condition (Definition 9) holds. Then\nthe (N + 1)-stage Noether identities are defined as (N + 2)-cycles of this complex. They\nare trivial if cycles are boundaries, while the converse is true iff the (N + 2)-homology\nregularity condition is satisfied. In this case, (N + 1)-stage Noether identities are identified\nto nontrivial elements of the (N + 2)-homology of the complex (33) (item (i) of Theorem\n11). If this homology is finitely generated, this complex is extended to the (N + 2)-exact\ncomplex P\u221e {N + 1}\u2264N +4 (41) with the boundary operator \u03b4N +1 (40) whose nilpotency\nrestarts all the Noether identities up to stage (N + 1) (item (ii) of Theorem 11).\nThis iteration procedure results in the exact Koszul\u2013Tate complex with the boundary\noperator whose nilpotency conditions reproduce all Noether and higher Noether identities\ncharacterizing the degeneracy of a differential operator E\n\n2\n\nThe ring of Grassmann-graded functions and their jets\n\nAll chain complexes considered in the article are complexes of certain rings of Grassmanngraded function and their jets on the infinite order jet manifold J \u221e Y of a fiber bundle\nY \u2192 X. Let us describe such a ring.\nRecall that J \u221e Y , is the projective limit (\u03c0r\u221e : J \u221e Y \u2192 J r Y ) of the inverse system of\njet manifolds\n\u03c0\n\nr\n\u03c0r\u22121\n\n\u03c01\n\n0\nJ 1 Y \u2190\u2212 * * * J r\u22121 Y \u2190\u2212 J r Y \u2190\u2212 * * * ,\nX \u2190\u2212 Y \u2190\u2212\n\n(1)\n\nr\nof J \u221e Y , where \u03c0r\u22121\nare affine bundles. It is a Fr\u00e9chet manifold. A bundle atlas {(UY ; x\u03bb , y i )}\nof Y \u2192 X induces the coordinate atlas\n\u2202x\u03bc\ni\n{((\u03c00\u221e )\u22121 (UY ); x\u03bb , y\u039bi )},\ny \u2032 \u03bb+\u039b = \u2032\u03bb d\u03bc y\u039b\u2032i ,\n0 \u2264 |\u039b|,\n(2)\n\u2202x\n\nwhere \u039b = (\u03bb1 ...\u03bbk ), \u03bb + \u039b = (\u03bb\u03bb1 ...\u03bbk ) are symmetric multi-indices and\nd\u03bb = \u2202\u03bb +\n\nX\n\ni\ny\u03bb+\u039b\n\u2202i\u039b ,\n\nd\u039b = d\u03bb1 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 d\u03bbk ,\n\n0\u2264|\u039b|\n\nare total derivatives. We further assume that the cover {\u03c0(UY )} of X is also the cover of\natlases of all vector bundles over X in question. The inverse system (1) yields the direct\nsystem\n\u03c0\u2217\n\nr\n\u2217\n\u03c0r\u22121\n\n\u03c01 \u2217\n\n0\nC \u221e (J 1 Y ) \u2212\u2192 * * * C \u221e (J r\u22121 Y ) \u2212\u2192 * * *\nC \u221e (X) \u2212\u2192 C \u221e (Y ) \u2212\u2192\n\n2\n\n\fof rings of smooth real functions on jet manifolds J r Y with respect to the pull-back\nr \u2217\nmonomorphisms \u03c0r\u22121\n. Its direct limit is the ring O\u221e Y of all smooth real functions on\nfinite order jet manifolds modulo the pull-back identification.\nLet us extend the ring O\u221e Y to a ring of graded functions on graded manifolds whose\nbodies are jet manifolds J r Y of Y [2, 5]. We restrict our consideration to graded manifolds\n(Z, A) with structure sheaves A of Grassmann algebras of finite rank, and refer to the\nfollowing Serre\u2013Swan theorem.\nTheorem 1. Let Z be a smooth manifold. A Grassmann algebra A over the ring C \u221e (Z) of\nsmooth real functions on Z is isomorphic to the Grassmann algebra of graded functions on a\ngraded manifold with a body Z iff it is the exterior algebra of some projective C \u221e (Z)-module\nof finite rank.\nProof. The proof follows at once from the Batchelor theorem [6] and the Serre-Swan\ntheorem generalized to an arbitrary smooth manifold [7, 8]. The Batchelor theorem states\nthat any graded manifold (Z, A) with a body Z is isomorphic to the one (Z, AQ ) with the\nstructure sheaf AQ of germs of sections of the exterior bundle\n2\n\n\u2227Q\u2217 = R \u2295 Q\u2217 \u2295 \u2227 Q\u2217 \u2295 * * * ,\nZ\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nwhere Q\u2217 is the dual of some vector bundle Q \u2192 Z. We agree to call (Z, AQ ) the simple\ngraded manifold with the structure vector bundle Q. Its structure ring AQ of graded\nfunctions (sections of AQ ) is the Z2 -graded exterior algebra of the C \u221e (Z)-module of sections\nof Q\u2217 \u2192 Z. By virtue of the Serre\u2013Swan theorem, a C \u221e (Z)-module is isomorphic to the\nmodule of sections of a smooth vector bundle over Z iff it is a projective module of finite\nrank.\n\u2737\nRemark 1. With respect to bundle coordinates (z A , q a ) on Q and the corresponding fiber\nbasis {ca } for Q\u2217 \u2192 X, graded functions read\nf=\n\nX\n\n1\nfa1 ...ak ca1 * * * cak ,\nk!\nk=0\n\nf \u2208 C \u221e (Z),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere we omit the symbol of the exterior product of elements ca . Let u \u2208 dAQ be a graded\nderivation of the R-ring AQ . Due to the canonical splitting V Q = Q \u00d7 Q, the fiber basis\n{\u2202a } for vertical tangent bundle V Q \u2192 Q of Q \u2192 Z is the dual of {ca } and, therefore, u\ntakes the local form u = uA \u2202A + ua \u2202a , where uA , ua are local graded functions [6]. It acts\non graded functions (3) by the rule\nu(fa...b ca * * * cb ) = uA \u2202A (fa...b )ca * * * cb + ud fa...b \u2202d \u230b(ca * * * cb ).\nGiven a vector bundle E \u2192 X, let us consider the simple graded manifold (J r Y, AEr )\nwhose body is J r Y and the structure bundle is the pull-back\nEr = J r Y \u00d7 J r E\nX\n\n3\n\n\fonto J r Y of the jet bundle J r E \u2192 X, which is a vector bundle. There is an epimorphism\nof graded manifolds\n(J r+1 Y, AEr+1 ) \u2192 (J r Y, AEr ).\nIt consists of the open surjection \u03c0rr+1 and the sheaf monomorphism \u03c0rr+1\u2217 : AEr \u2192\nAEr+1 , where \u03c0rr+1\u2217 AEr is the pull-back onto J r+1 Y of the topological fiber bundle AEr \u2192\nJ r Y . These sheaf monomorphisms yield monomorphisms of the corresponding canonical\npresheaves AEr \u2192 AEr+1 , which make up a direct system\nAY \u00d7E \u2212\u2192 AE1 \u2212\u2192 * * * AEr \u2212\u2192 * * * ,\n\n(4)\n\nand the monomorphisms of graded commutative rings AEr \u2192 AEr+1 assembled into the\ndirect system\n(5)\nAY \u00d7E \u2212\u2192 AE1 \u2212\u2192 * * * AEr \u2212\u2192 * * * .\nA direct limit of this direct system is a graded commutative ring S\u221e [E; Y ] of all graded\nfunctions f \u2208 AEr on jet manifolds J r Y modulo monomorphisms \u03c0rr+1\u2217 . The monomorphisms C \u221e (J r Y ) \u2192 AEr provide the monomorphism O\u221e Y \u2192 S\u221e [E; Y ], while the body\nepimorphisms AEr \u2192 C \u221e (J r Y ) yield the epimorphism S\u221e [E; Y ] \u2192 O\u221e Y .\nOne can think of elements of S\u221e [E; Y ] as being graded functions on J \u221e Y as follows.\nA direct limit of the direct system of presheaves (4) is a presheaf on the infinite order jet\nmanifold J \u221e Y . Let T\u221e [E; Y ] be the sheaf of germs of this presheaf. The structure module\n\u0393(T\u221e [E; Y ]) of sections of T\u221e [E; Y ] is a ring such that, given an element f \u2208 \u0393(T\u221e [E; Y ])\nand a point z \u2208 J \u221e Y , there exist an open neighbourhood U of z and a graded function f (k)\non some finite order jet manifold J k Y so that f |U = \u03c0k\u221e\u2217 f (k) |U . In particular, there is the\nmonomorphism S\u221e [E; Y ] \u2192 \u0393(T\u221e [E; Y ]). Due to this monomorphism, one can restrict\nS\u221e [E; Y ] to the coordinate chart (2), and say that S\u221e [E; Y ] as an O\u221e Y -ring is locally\ngenerated by the elements ca\u039b , where {ca } is a a local fiber basis for E \u2217 over \u03c0\u221e (U). We\nagree to call (y\u039bi , ca\u039b ), 0 \u2264 |\u039b|, the local basis for S\u221e [E; Y ]. Let the collective symbol sA\n\u039b\nstand for its elements.\nRemark 2. One can think of ca\u039b as being jets of graded functions ca [2, 5]. This definition\ndiffers from the notion of jets of a graded commutative ring [7] and that of jets of a graded\nfiber bundle [9], but reproduces the heuristic notion of jets of odd fields in Lagrangian field\ntheory [10].\nRemark 3. Let V , V \u2032 and V \u2032\u2032 be vector bundles over X. Let us consider the ring\nS\u221e [V \u00d7 E; Y \u00d7 V \u2032 \u00d7 V \u2032\u2032 ],\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nand its subring of graded functions which are polynomial in fiber coordinates of the vector\nbundle Y \u00d7 V \u2032 \u00d7 V \u2032\u2032 \u2192 Y . We denote the latter by P\u221e [V E; Y ; V \u2032 V \u2032\u2032 ]. One can think of its\nX\n\nX\n\nelements as being graded functions on J \u221e Y , too.\n4\n\n\fLet \u03b8 \u2208 dS\u221e [E; Y ] be a graded derivation of the R-ring S\u221e [E; Y ] [2, 5]. With respect\nto the local basis (sA\n\u039b ), it takes the form\n\u03b8 = \u03b8\u03bb d\u03bb + (\u03b8A \u2202A +\n\nX\n\nd\u039b \u03b8A \u2202A\u039b ),\n\n|\u039b|>0\n\nwhere the tuple of graded derivations {\u2202a\u039b } is the dual of the tuple {ca\u039b } of generating\nelements of the O\u221e [F ; Y ]-algebra S\u221e [E; Y ], and \u03b8\u03bb , \u03b8A are local graded functions. We\nfurther restrict our consideration to vertical contact graded derivations\n\u03b8=\n\nX\n\nd\u039b \u03c5 A \u2202A\u039b .\n\n(6)\n\n0\u2264|\u039b|\n\nSuch a derivation is completely determined by its first summand\n\u03c5 = \u03c5 A (x\u03bb , sA\n\u039b )\u2202A ,\n\n0 \u2264 |\u039b| \u2264 k,\n\n(7)\n\ncalled a generalized graded vector field. For the sake of simplicity, the common symbol \u03c5\nfurther stands both for a contact graded derivation (6) and a generalized vector field (7),\nwhich is also called a graded derivation. A graded derivation \u03c5 is said to be nilpotent if\n\u03c5(\u03c5(f )) = 0 for any graded function f \u2208 S\u221e [E; Y ]. One can show that \u03c5 is nilpotent only\nif it is odd and iff all \u03c5 A obey the equality\n\u03c5(\u03c5 A ) =\n\nX\n\n\u03c5\u03a3B \u2202B\u03a3 (\u03c5 A ) = 0.\n\n(8)\n\n0\u2264|\u03a3|\n\n3\n\nNoether identities\n\nLet E be a E-valued differential operator on a smooth fiber bundle Y \u2192 X.\nProposition 2. One can associate to E a chain complex whose boundaries vanish on Ker E.\nProof. A differential operator E is locally represented by a set of functions E a \u2208\nO\u221e Y , possessing the corresponding coordinate transformation law. Let us provide the ring\nS\u221e [E; Y ] with the nilpotent graded derivation\n\u2190\n\n\u03b4 = \u2202 aE a,\n\n(9)\n\nwhose definition is independent of the choice of a local basis. It is convenient to deal with\na graded derivation \u03b4 (9) acting on graded functions on the right by the rule\n\u2032\n\n\u03b4(f \u2227 f \u2032 ) = (\u22121)[f ] \u03b4(f ) \u2227 f \u2032 + f \u2227 \u03b4(f \u2032 ),\nwhere [f \u2032 ] denotes the Grassmann parity. We call \u03b4 (9) the Koszul\u2013Tate differential. With\nthis differential, the ring S\u221e [E; Y ] is split into the chain complex\n\u03b4\n\n\u03b4\n\n0 \u2190 O\u221e Y \u2190\u2212 S\u221e [E; Y ]1 * * * \u2190\u2212 S\u221e [E; Y ]k * * *\n5\n\n(10)\n\n\fgraded in polynomials of the odd elements ca\u039b . Following the physical literature [2, 10], we\nassign to ca\u039b the antifield number Ant[ca\u039b ] = 1. It is readily observed that the boundaries of\nthe complex (10) vanish on Ker E.\n\u2737\nNote that homology groups H\u2217 (\u03b4) of the complex (10) are O\u221e Y -modules, but these\nmodules fail to be torsion-free. Indeed, given a cycle \u03a6 \u2208 S\u221e [E; Y ]k and an element f = \u03b4\u03c3\nof the ring O\u221e Y \u2282 S\u221e [E; Y ], we obtain that f \u03a6 = \u03b4(\u03c3\u03a6) is a boundary. Therefore, one\ncan not apply the K\u00fcnneth formula to the homology of this complex, though any its term\nS\u221e [E; Y ]k is isomorphic to the graded commutative k-tensor product of the O\u221e Y -module\nS\u221e [E; Y ]1 .\nThe homology H0 (\u03b4) of the complex (10) is not trivial, but this homology and the higher\nones Hk\u22652(\u03b4) are not essential for our consideration. Therefore, we replace the complex (10)\nwith the finite one\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\n0 \u2190 Im \u03b4 \u2190\u2212 S\u221e [E; Y ]1 \u2190\u2212 S\u221e [E; Y ]2\n(11)\nof graded functions of antifield number k \u2264 2. It is exact at Im \u03b4, and its first homology\ncoincides with that of the complex (10). Let us consider this homology.\nA generic one-chain of the complex (11) takes the form\n\u03a6=\n\nX\n\n\u03a6\u039ba ca\u039b ,\n\n\u03a6\u039ba \u2208 O\u221e Y,\n\n(12)\n\n0\u2264|\u039b|\n\nand the cycle condition \u03b4\u03a6 = 0 reads\nX\n\n\u03a6\u039ba d\u039b E a = 0.\n\n(13)\n\n0\u2264|\u039b|\n\nOne can think of this equality as being a reduction condition on a differential operator\nE. Conversely, any reduction condition of form (13) comes from some cycle (12). The\nreduction condition (13) is trivial if a cycle is a boundary, i.e., it takes the form\n\u03a6=\n\nX\n\n\u039b\u03a3\nTab\nd\u03a3 E bca\u039b ,\n\n\u039b\u03a3\n\u03a3\u039b\nTab\n= \u2212Tba\n.\n\n(14)\n\n0\u2264|\u039b|,|\u03a3|\n\nIf E is an Euler\u2013Lagrange operator of some Lagrangian system on a fiber bundle Y \u2192 X,\nthe nontrivial reduction condition (13) is a Noether identity [1, 2]. Therefore, we come to\nthe following definition.\nDefinition 3. A differential operator E is called degenerate if the homology H1 (\u03b4) of the\ncomplex (14) (or (12)) is not trivial. We agree to call a cycle condition (13) the Noether\nidentity.\nOne can say something more if the O\u221e Y -module H1 (\u03b4) is finitely generated, i.e., it\npossesses the following particular structure. There are elements \u2206 \u2208 H1 (\u03b4) making up a\nprojective C \u221e (X)-module C(0) of finite rank which, by virtue of the Serre\u2013Swan theorem,\n\n6\n\n\fis isomorphic to the module of sections of some vector bundle E0 \u2192 X. Let {\u2206r } be local\nbases for this C \u221e (X)-module. Then every element \u03a6 \u2208 H1 (\u03b4) factorizes\nX\n\n\u03a6=\n\nG\u039er d\u039e \u2206r ,\n\nG\u039er \u2208 O\u221e Y,\n\n(15)\n\n\u2206\u039br\na \u2208 O\u221e Y,\n\n(16)\n\n0\u2264|\u039e|\n\n\u2206r =\n\nX\n\na\n\u2206\u039br\na c\u039b ,\n\n0\u2264|\u039b|\n\nvia elements of C(0) , i.e., any Noether identity (13) is a corollary of the Noether identities\nX\n\na\n\u2206\u039br\na d\u039b E = 0.\n\n(17)\n\n0\u2264|\u039b|\n\nClearly, the factorization (15) is independent of specification of local bases {\u2206r }. We say\nthat the Noether identities (17) are complete, and call \u2206 \u2208 C(0) the Noether operators.\nNote that, being representatives of H1 (\u03b4), the graded functions \u2206r (16) are not \u03b4-exact.\nProposition 4. If the homology H1 (\u03b4) of the complex (11) is finitely generated, this complex\ncan be extended to a one-exact complex with a boundary operator whose nilpotency conditions\n(8) are just complete Noether identities (see the complex (19) below).\nProof. Let us consider the ring P\u221e [E; Y ; E0 ] of graded functions on J \u221e Y (see Remark\n3). It possesses local bases {y\u039bi , ca\u039b , cr\u039b }, where [cr\u039b ] = 0 and Ant[cr\u039b ] = 2. This ring is\nprovided with the nilpotent graded derivation\n\u2190\n\n\u03b40 = \u03b4+ \u2202 r \u2206r ,\n\n(18)\n\ncalled the extended Koszul\u2013Tate differential. Its nilpotency conditions (8) are equivalent to\nthe complete Noether identities (17). Then the module P\u221e [E; Y ; E0 ]\u22643 of graded functions\nof antifield number k \u2264 3 is split into the chain complex\n\u03b4\n\n\u03b4\n\n\u03b4\n\n0\n0\n0 \u2190 Im \u03b4 \u2190\u2212 S\u221e [E; Y ]1 \u2190\u2212\nP\u221e [E; Y ; E0 ]2 \u2190\u2212\nP\u221e [E; Y ; E0 ]3 .\n\n(19)\n\nLet H\u2217 (\u03b40 ) denote its homology. We have H0 (\u03b40 ) = H0 (\u03b4) = 0. Furthermore, any one-cycle\n\u03a6 up to a boundary takes the form (15) and, therefore, it is a \u03b40 -boundary\n\u03a6=\n\nX\n\nG\u039er d\u039e \u2206r = \u03b40 (\n\n0\u2264|\u03a3|\n\nX\n\nG\u039er cr\u039e ).\n\n0\u2264|\u03a3|\n\nHence, H1 (\u03b40 ) = 0, i.e., the complex (19) is one-exact.\n\n4\n\n\u2737\n\nThe Koszul\u2013Tate complex\n\nTurn now to the second homology H2 (\u03b40 ) of the complex (19).

Conversely, let\n\u03a6=\n\nX\n\nG\u039br cr\u039b \u2208 P\u221e [E; Y ; E0 ]2\n\n0\u2264|\u039b|\n\nbe a graded function such that the reduction condition (21) holds. Obviously, it is a cycle\ncondition of the two-chain (20). The reduction condition (21) is trivial either if a two-cycle\n\u03a6 (20) is a boundary or its summand G vanishes on Ker E.\nDefinition 5. A degenerate differential operator is said to be one-stage reducible if there\nexist non-trivial reduction conditions (21), called first-stage Noether identities.\nProposition 6. First-stage Noether identities can be identified to nontrivial elements of\nthe homology H2 (\u03b40 ) iff any \u03b4-cycle \u03a6 \u2208 S\u221e [E; Y ]2 is a \u03b40 -boundary.\nProof. It suffices to show that, if the summand G of a two-cycle \u03a6 (20) is \u03b4-exact, then\n\u03a6 is a boundary. If G = \u03b4\u03a8, then\n\u03a6 = \u03b40 \u03a8 + (\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b40 )\u03a8 + H.\n\n(22)\n\nThe cycle condition reads\n\u03b40 \u03a6 = \u03b4((\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b40 )\u03a8 + H) = 0.\nThen (\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b40 )\u03a8 + H is \u03b40 -exact since any \u03b4-cycle \u03c6 \u2208 S\u221e [E; Y ]2 by assumption is a \u03b40 boundary. Consequently, \u03a6 (22) is \u03b40 -exact. Conversely, let \u03a6 \u2208 S\u221e [E; Y ]2 be an arbitrary\n\u03b4-cycle. The cycle condition reads\na\nb\n\u039b\u03a3 a\nb\n\u03b4\u03a6 = 2\u03a6\u039b\u03a3\nab c\u039b \u03b4c\u03a3 = 2\u03a6ab c\u039b d\u03a3 E = 0.\n\n(23)\n\nb\nIt follows that \u03a6\u039b\u03a3\nab \u03b4c\u03a3 = 0 for all induces (a, \u039b). Omitting a \u03b4-boundary term, we obtain\n\u039b\u039e\nr\nb\n\u03a6\u039b\u03a3\nab c\u03a3 = Gar d\u039e \u2206 .\n\nHence, \u03a6 takes the form\nr a\n\u03a6 = \u2212G\u039b\u039e\nar d\u039e \u2206 c\u039b .\n\n(24)\n\nr a\nWe can associate to it the three-chain \u03a8 = \u2212G\u039b\u039e\nar c\u039e c\u039b such that\na r\n\u03b40 \u03a8 = \u03a6 + \u03c3 = \u03a6 \u2212 G\u039b\u039e\nar d\u039b E c\u039e .\n\nOwing to the equality \u03b4\u03a6 = 0, we have \u03b40 \u03c3 = 0. Since \u03c3 is \u03b4-exact, it by assumption is\n\u03b40 -exact, i.e., \u03c3 = \u03b40 \u03c8. Then we obtain that \u03a6 = \u03b40 \u03a8 \u2212 \u03b40 \u03c8.\n\u2737\n8\n\n\fLemma 7. It is easily justified that a two-cycle \u03a6 \u2208 S\u221e [E; Y ]2 is \u03b40 -exact iff \u03a6 up to a\n\u03b4-boundary takes the form\nX\nr\nr\u2032\n\u03a6=\n(25)\nG\u03a3\u039b\nrr \u2032 d\u03a3 \u2206 d\u039b \u2206 .\n0\u2264|\u039b|,|\u03a3|\n\nIf the condition of Proposition 6 (called the two-homology regularity condition) is satisfied, let us assume that first-stage Noether identities are finitely generated as follows.

It is a \u03b4N \u22122 -cycle and, consequently, a \u03b4N \u22121 -boundary \u03b4N \u22121 \u03a8 in\naccordance with the (N + 1)-homology regularity condition. Then the reduction condition\nr\n(36) is a c\u03a3N\u22121 -dependent part of the cycle condition\n\u03b4N (\n\nX\n0\u2264|\u039b|\n\nG\u039brN cr\u039bN +\n\nX\n\nr\n\n\u039e\u03a3\nHar\nca c N\u22121 \u2212 \u03a8) = 0,\nN\u22121 \u039e \u03a3\n\n0\u2264\u03a3,0\u2264\u039e\n\nbut \u03b4N \u03a8 does not make a contribution to this reduction condition.\nBeing a cycle condition, the reduction condition (36) is trivial either if a cycle \u03a6 (35) is\na \u03b4N -boundary or its summand G is \u03b4-exact, i.e., it is a boundary, too, as we have stated\nabove. Then Definition 5 can be generalized as follows.\n\n11\n\n\fDefinition 10. A degenerate differential operator is said to be (N + 1)-stage reducible if\nthere exist non-trivial reduction conditions (36), called the (N + 1)-stage Noether identities.\nTheorem 11. (i) The (N + 1)-stage Noether identities can be identified to nontrivial\nelements of the homology HN +2 (\u03b4N ) of the complex (33) iff this homology obeys the (N + 2)homology regularity condition. (ii) If the homology HN +2 (\u03b4N ) is finitely generated as defined\nbelow, the complex (33) admits an (N + 2)-exact extension.\nProof. (i) The (N + 2)-homology regularity condition implies that any \u03b4N \u22121 -cycle\n\u03a6 \u2208 P\u221e {N \u22121}N +2 \u2282 P\u221e {N}N +2 is a \u03b4N -boundary. Therefore, if \u03a6 (35) is a representative\nof a nontrivial element of HN +2 (\u03b4N ), its summand G linear in cr\u039bN does not vanish. Moreover,\nit is not a \u03b4-boundary. Indeed, if \u03a6 = \u03b4\u03a8, then\n\u03a6 = \u03b4N \u03a8 + (\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b4N )\u03a8 + H.\n\n(37)\n\nThe cycle condition takes the form\n\u03b4N \u03a6 = \u03b4N \u22121 ((\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b4N )\u03a8 + H) = 0.\nHence, (\u03b4 \u2212\u03b40 )\u03a8 + H is \u03b4N -exact since any \u03b4N \u22121 -cycle \u03c6 \u2208 P\u221e {N \u22121}N +2 is a \u03b4N -boundary.\nConsequently, \u03a6 (37) is a boundary. If the (N + 2)-homology regularity condition does not\nhold, trivial reduction conditions (36) also come from nontrivial elements of the homology\nHN +2 (\u03b4N ).\n(ii) Let the (N + 1)-stage Noether identities be finitely generated. Namely, there exist\nelements \u2206(N +1) \u2208 HN +2 (\u03b4N ) making up a projective C \u221e (X)-module C(N +1) of finite rank\nwhich is isomorphic to the module of sections of some vector bundle EN +1 \u2192 X. Let\n{\u2206rN+1 } be local bases for this C \u221e (X)-module. Then any element \u03a6 \u2208 HN +2 (\u03b4N ) factorizes\n\u03a6=\n\nX\n\n\u03a6\u039erN+1 d\u039e \u2206rN+1 ,\n\n\u03a6\u039erN+1 \u2208 O\u221e Y,\n\n0\u2264|\u039e|\n\nX\n\n\u2206rN+1 = GrN+1 + hrN+1 =\n\n(38)\n\n\u2206r\u039brNN+1 cr\u039bN + hrN+1 ,\n\n(39)\n\n0\u2264|\u039b|\n\nthrough elements of C(N +1) . Clearly, this factorization is independent of specification of\nlocal bases {\u2206rN+1 }. Let us extend the ring P\u221e {N} to the ring P\u221e {N + 1} possessing local\nbases\nr\n\n{y\u039bi , ca\u039b , cr\u039b , cr\u039b1 , . . . , cr\u039bN , c\u039bN+1 },\n\nr\n\n[c\u039bN+1 ] = Nmod 2,\n\nr\n\nAnt[c\u039bN+1 ] = N + 3.\n\nIt is provided with the nilpotent graded derivation\n\u2190\n\n\u03b4N +1 = \u03b4N + \u2202\n\n12\n\nrN+1\nrN+1 \u2206\n\n(40)\n\n\fof antifield number -1. With this graded derivation, the module P\u221e {N + 1}\u2264N +4 of graded\nfunctions of antifield number Ant[f ] \u2264 N + 4 is split into the chain complex\n\u03b4\n\n\u03b4\n\n\u03b4N\u22121\n\n\u03b4\n\n0\n1\n0 \u2190 Im \u03b4 \u2190\u2212 S\u221e [E; Y ]1 \u2190\u2212\nP\u221e {0}2 \u2190\u2212\nP\u221e {1}3 * * * \u2190\u2212 P\u221e {N \u2212 1}N +1\n\n\u03b4N\n\n\u03b4N+1\n\n(41)\n\n\u03b4N+1\n\n\u2190\u2212 P\u221e {N}N +2 \u2190\u2212 P\u221e {N + 1}N +3 \u2190\u2212 P\u221e {N + 1}N +4 .\nIt is readily observed that this complex is (N + 2)-exact. In this case, the (N + 1)-stage\nNoether identities (36) come from the complete (N + 1)-stage Noether identities\nX\n\n\u2206r\u039brNN+1 d\u039b \u2206rN + \u03b4hrN+1 = 0,\n\n0\u2264|\u039b|\n\nwhich are reproduced as the nilpotency conditions of the graded derivation (40).\n\n\u2737\n\nThe iteration procedure based on Theorem 11 can be prolonged up to an integer Nmax\nwhen the Nmax -stage Noether identities are irreducible, i.e., the homology HNmax +2 (\u03b4Nmax )\nis trivial. This iteration procedure may also be infinite. It results in the manifested exact\nKoszul\u2013Tate complex with the Koszul\u2013Tate boundary operator whose nilpotency conditions\nreproduce all Noether and higher Noether identities of an original differential operator E.\n\nReferences\n[1] D.
