During the\nlast few years of inspiral these systems generate continuous gravitational waves in the LISA band, which will allow the detection of as many as several hundred systems\nout to redshift z \u223c 1 [3]. However, prior to this phase,\nthe inspiraling object spends many years on a highly eccentric orbit, generating bursts of gravitational radiation\nat each periapse passage. LISA could resolve individual\nbursts from sources in the nearby Universe. Initial estimates [4] suggested a LISA event rate of \u223c 18 yr\u22121 ,\nincluding \u223c 15 yr\u22121 from the centre of the Milky Way,\nalthough this was subsequently revised downwards to\n\u223c 1 yr\u22121 with negligible contribution from extragalactic sources [5]. If even a single burst from the Galactic\ncentre is detected during the LISA mission, this will provide an unparalleled probe of the structure of spacetime\nthere.\nThe spectrum of radiation from these bursts will be\nwell approximated by the spectrum of a parabolic orbit.1\nIn this note we derive an analytic approximation to this\nspectrum by taking the limit of the Peters and Mathews [6, 7] (PM) energy spectrum for eccentric Keplerian\nbinaries. We show that the peak of the spectrum depends primarily on the orbital periapse and only weakly\non the eccentricity. We also estimate the range of validity of the approximation (in Sec. III) by comparing\nto numerical Teukolsky data, finding that it is a good\napproximation for equatorial orbits in Kerr with peri-\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n1\n\ncplb2@ast.cam.ac.uk\njgair@ast.cam.ac.uk\nWe use \"parabolic\" to refer to marginally bound orbits.\nMarginally bound Keplerian orbits are parabola; in curved spacetimes they do not retain such a simple shape.\n\napse rp & 20M . The parabolic spectrum takes a neat\nanalytic form; deriving it from the bound spectrum will\nallow corrections for high-eccentricity bound orbits to be\nfound in the future. We hope this note will be a useful\nresource for future work on gravitational radiation from\nhigh-eccentricity orbits.\nII.\nA.\n\nPARABOLIC LIMIT\nEnergy Spectrum\n\nFor an orbit of eccentricity e with periapse radius rp ,\nPeters and Mathews [6] give the power radiated into the\nnth harmonic of the orbital angular frequency as\nP (n) =\n\n32 G4 M12 M22 (M1 + M2 )(1 \u2212 e)5\ng(n, e),\n5 c5\nrp5\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the function g(n, e) is defined in terms of Bessel\nfunctions of the first kind\n\u001a\u0014\nn4\nJn\u22122 (ne) \u2212 2eJn\u22121 (ne)\ng(n, e) =\n32\n\u00152\n2\n+ Jn (ne) + 2eJn+1 (ne) \u2212 Jn+2 (ne)\nn\n\u0001\n2\n+ 1 \u2212 e2 [Jn\u22122 (ne) \u2212 2Jn (ne) + Jn+2 (ne)]\n\u001b\n4\n2\n(2)\n+ 2 [Jn (ne)] .\n3n\nThe Keplerian orbital frequency is\n\u03c912 =\n\nG(M1 + M2 )(1 \u2212 e)3\n= (1 \u2212 e)3 \u03c9c2 ,\nrp3\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c9c is defined as the angular frequency of a circular\norbit of radius rp .

Although\nmore power is radiated into higher harmonics, the peak\nof the spectrum does not move much: it is always between f = fc and f = 2fc , with f = 2fc for e = 0 and\nf \u2243 1.637fc for e = 1.\nB.\n\nTotal Energy\n\nTo check the validity of this limit we can calculate the\ntotal energy radiated by integrating (23) over all frequencies, or by summing the energy radiated into each harmonic. These must yield the same result. Summing:\nEsum =\n\nX\n64\u03c0 G3 M12 M22\n\u03c9c (1 \u2212 e)7/2\ng(n, e),\n5\n2\n5 c\nrp\nn\n\n(25)\n\nwhere we have used equations (1), (3) and (4).

This should be a valid approximation in\nthe weak-field regime far from a massive body. To find\nthe limit of this approximation, we can compare the\nPM results with those from more accurate techniques.\nEnergy spectra for parabolic orbits do not seem to be\navailable in the literature yet, so we will make do with\nthe total energy fluxes calculated by Martel [10], who\nuses time-domain black hole perturbation theory for a\nSchwarzschild black hole of mass M . Figure 2 shows the\nratio of the two energies as a function of periapse distance. As expected the PM result is more accurate for\nlarger periapses. The agreement worsens as the periapsis\ndecreases. At rp = 4M , corresponding to the radius of\nthe innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), the energy\nflux calculated by Martel diverges, so the ratio tends to\nzero. This divergence is because in Schwarzschild (or\nKerr) spacetime a parabolic orbit may have a zoom-whirl\nstructure where it undergoes a number of near circular\nrotations (whirls) about the black hole. As the radius of\nthe ISCO is approached, the number of whirls tends to\ninfinity (in the absence of radiation reaction), so an infinite amount of energy is radiated. Figure 2 also shows\nhow the ratio of energies follows the number of rotations,\ndefined as N = \u2206\u03c6/2\u03c0, where \u2206\u03c6 is the total change in\nthe azimuthal angle over one orbit. As N increases, the\nPM approximation worsens because the Keplerian orbit\ndoes not include this extra rotation. The accuracy of\nthe PM result deteriorates rapidly once the orbit transitions to a zoom-whirl trajectory and is therefore far from\nparabolic in shape.\nThe PM result is accurate to \u223c 10% for orbits with\nN . 1.1. We will adopt this as a cutoff point.

Figure 3 shows the periapsis for which N = 1.1 for a range of spins. Equatorial\norbits with larger periapses should be reasonably approximated by the PM result.\nNonequatorial orbits are more complicated because of\nthe additional precession of the orbital plane. This extra\nrotation will mean that the PM approach is less accurate;\nhowever, this should be subdominant to the perihelion\nprecession effect and so the cutoff periapsis should not\nbe much larger than for the equatorial case.\n\nB.\n\nAstrophysical Implications\n\nConsidering bursts from the Galactic centre, orbits\nwith periapses of rp . 120M could generate bursts that\nwould be detectable with LISA [4, 5]. It is therefore\nlikely that any such burst that was detected would be\nin the regime of validity of the Peters and Mathews approach, rp & 20M for equatorial orbits. The results described in this note will therefore have application in that\ncontext, and it should be possible to explore the majority of parameter space using this approximation. The\nmost interesting orbits, those which come deep within\nthe strong-field region of the black hole's spacetime, will\nbe beyond the range of validity of this approximation,\nbut these represent a small subset of all plausible events.\nThis result may also be applicable for studying\nparabolic encounters between stellar mass black holes;\nthese may occur in densely populated environments such\nas globular clusters [13] or the Galactic centre [14].\nBursts from these encounters should be detectable with\nnear-future ground-based detectors, such as the Advanced Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory [13, 14].\n\n\f5\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nCPLB is supported by STFC.
