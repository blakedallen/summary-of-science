Introduction\nA primary goal of this paper is to formally link central areas of study in operator theory\nand quantum information theory. More specifically, we connect recent investigations in\noperator space and operator system theory [1, 2] on the one hand and the theory of entanglement [3, 4] on the other. As benefits of this combined perspective, we obtain new results\nand new elementary proofs in both areas. We give further details below before proceeding.\nGiven a (classical description of a) quantum state \u03c1, one of the most basic open questions\nin quantum information theory asks for an operational criterion for determining whether\n\u03c1 is separable or entangled. Much progress has been made on this front over the past\ntwo decades. For instance, a revealing connection between the separability problem and\noperator theory was established in [5], where it was shown that \u03c1 is separable if and only\nif it remains positive under the application of any positive map to one half of the state.\nAnother more recent approach characterizes separability via maps that are contractive in\nthe trace norm on Hermitian operators [6]. In this work we show that these two approaches\nto the separability problem can be seen as arising from the theory of minimal and maximal\noperator systems and operator spaces, respectively.\nAdditionally, this work can be seen as demonstrating how to rephrase certain positivity\nquestions that are relevant in quantum information theory in terms of norms that are\nrelevant in operator theory instead. For example, instead of using positive maps to detect\nseparability of quantum states, we can construct a natural operator system into which\npositive maps are completely positive. Then the completely bounded norm on that operator\nsystem serves as a tool for detecting separability of quantum states as well.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nN. JOHNSTON, D. W. KRIBS, V. I. PAULSEN, AND R. PEREIRA\n\nA natural generalization of the characterization of separable states in terms of positive\nlinear maps was implicit in [7] and proved in [8] \u2013 a state has Schmidt number no greater\nthan k if and only if it remains positive under the application of any k-positive map to one\nhalf of the state. Recently, a further connection was made between operator theory and\nquantum information: a map is completely positive on what is known as the maximal (resp.\nminimal) operator system on Mn , the space of n \u00d7 n complex matrices, if and only if it is\na positive (resp. entanglement-breaking [9]) map [10]. Thus, the maps that serve to detect\nquantum entanglement are the completely positive maps on the maximal operator system\non Mn .\nSimilarly, completely positive maps on \"k-super maximal\" and \"k-super minimal\" operator systems on Mn [11] have been studied and shown to be the same as k-positive and\nk-partially entanglement breaking maps [12], respectively. We will reprove these statements via an elementary proof that shows that the cones of positive elements that define\nthe k-super maximal (resp. k-super minimal) operator systems are exactly the cones of\n(unnormalized) states with Schmidt number at most k (resp. k-block positive operators).\nAnalogous to the minimal and maximal operator systems, there are minimal and maximal\noperator spaces (and appropriate k-minimal and k-maximal generalizations). We will show\nthe norms that define the k-minimal operator spaces on Mn coincide with a family of norms\nthat have recently been studied in quantum information theory [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]\nfor their applications to the problems of detecting k-positive linear maps and NPPT bound\nentangled states. Furthermore, we will connect the dual of a version of the completely\nbounded minimal operator space norm to the separability problem and extend recent results\nabout how trace-contractive maps can be used to detect entanglement. We will see that\nthe maps that serve to detect quantum entanglement via norms are roughly the completely\ncontractive maps on the minimal operator space on Mn . The natural generalization to\nnorms that detect states with Schmidt number k is proved via a stabilization result for the\ncompletely bounded norm from Mr to the k-minimal operator space (or system) of Mn .\nIn Section 2 we introduce the reader to the various relevant notions from quantum information theory such as separability and Schmidt rank. In Section 3 we introduce (abstract)\noperator spaces and the k-minimal and k-maximal operator space structures, and investigate their relationship with norms that have been used in quantum information theory. In\nSection 4 we give a similar treatment to abstract operator systems and the k-super minimal\nand k-super maximal operator system structures. We then investigate some norms on the\nk-super minimal operator system structures in Section 5. We close in Section 6 by considering the completely bounded version of some of the norms that have been presented and\nestablish a relationship with the Schmidt number of quantum states.\n2. Quantum Information Theory Preliminaries\nGiven a vector space V , we will use Mm,p (V ) to denote the space of m \u00d7 p matrices with\nelements from V . For brevity we will write Mm (V ) := Mm,m (V ) and Mm := Mm (C). It will\noccasionally be convenient to use tensor product notation and identify Mm \u2297 V \u223c\n= Mm (V )\nin the standard way, especially when V = Mn . We will make use of bra-ket notation from\nquantum mechanics as follows: we will use \"kets\" |vi \u2208 Cn to represent unit (column)\nvectors and \"bras\" hv| := |vi\u2217 to represent the dual (row) vectors, where (*)\u2217 represents\n\n\fOPERATOR SPACES AND OPERATOR SYSTEMS IN ENTANGLEMENT THEORY\n\n3\n\nthe conjugate transpose. Unit vectors represent pure quantum states (or more specifically,\nthe projection |vihv| onto the vector |vi represents a pure quantum state) and thus we will\nsometimes refer to unit vectors as states. Mixed quantum states are represented by density\noperators \u03c1 \u2208 Mm \u2297 Mn that are positive semidefinite with Tr(\u03c1) = 1.\nA state |vi \u2208 Cm \u2297 Cn is called separable if there exist |v1 i \u2208 Cm , |v2 i \u2208 Cn such that\n|vi = |v1 i \u2297 |v2 i; otherwise it is said to be entangled. The Schmidt rank of a P\nstate |vi,\ndenoted SR(|vi), is the least number separable states |vi i needed to write |vi = i \u03b1i |vi i,\nwhere \u03b1i are some (real) coefficients. The analogue of Schmidt rank for a bipartite mixed\nstate \u03c1 \u2208 Mm \u2297 Mn is Schmidt number [7], denoted SNP\n(\u03c1), which is defined to be the\nleast integer k such that \u03c1 can be written in the form \u03c1 = i pi |vi ihvi | with {pi } forming a\nprobability distribution and SR(|vi i) \u2264 k for all i.\nAn operator X = X \u2217 \u2208 Mm \u2297 Mn is said to be k-block positive (or a k-entanglement\nwitness) if hv|X|vi \u2265 0 for all vectors |vi with SR(|vi) \u2264 k. In the extreme case when k =\nmin{m, n}, we see that the k-block positive operators are exactly the positive semidefinite\noperators (since SR(|vi) \u2264 min{m, n} for all vectors |vi), and for smaller k the set of k-block\npositive operators is strictly larger.\nIn [13, 14], a family of operator norms that have several connections in quantum information theory was investigated. Arising from the Schmidt rank of bipartite pure states,\nthey are defined for operators X \u2208 Mm \u2297 Mn as follows:\n\b\nX S(k) = sup |hv|X|wi| : SR(|vi), SR(|wi) \u2264 k .\n(1)\n|vi,|wi\n\nThese norms were shown to be useful for determining whether or not an operator is k-block\npositive, and also have applications to the problem of determining whether or not there exist\nbound entangled non-positive partial transpose states [13, 16]. The problem of computing\nthese norms was investigated in [14].\nThe completely bounded norm of a linear map \u03a6 : Mr \u2192 Mn is defined to be\nn\no\n\u03a6 cb := sup (idm \u2297 \u03a6)(X) : X \u2208 Mm (Mr ) with X \u2264 1 .\nm\u22651\n\nIt was shown by Smith [20] (and independently later by Kitaev [21] from the dual perspective) that it suffices to fix m = n so that \u03a6 cb = idn \u2297 \u03a6 . We will see in Section 6 a\nconnection between the norms idk \u2297 \u03a6 for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n and the norms (1).\n3. k-Minimal and k-Maximal Operator Spaces\nWe will now present (abstract) operator spaces and the k-minimal and k-maximal operator space structures. An operator space is a vector space V together with a family\nof L\u221e matrix norms k * kMm (V ) on Mm (V ) that make V into a matrix normed space.\nThat is, we require that if A = (aij ), B = (bij ) \u2208 Mp,m and X = (xij ) \u2208 Mm (V ) then\nA * X * B \u2217 Mp (V ) \u2264 A X Mm (V ) B , where\nA * X * B \u2217 :=\n\nm\n\u0010 X\n\nk,l=1\n\n\u0011\naik xkl bjl \u2208 Mp (V )\n\n\f4\n\nN. JOHNSTON, D. W. KRIBS, V. I. PAULSEN, AND R. PEREIRA\n\nand A , B represent\nthe operator norm on Mp,m . The L\u221e requirement is that X \u2295\n\b\nY Mm+p (V ) = max kXkMm (V ) , kY kMp (V ) for all X \u2208 Mm (V ), Y \u2208 Mp (V ).\nWhen the particular operator space structure (i.e., the family of L\u221e matrix norms) on\nV is not important, we will denote the operator space simply by V . We will use Mn itself\nto denote the \"standard\" operator space structure on Mn that is obtained by associating\nMm (Mn ) with Mmn in the natural way and using the operator norm. For a more detailed\nintroduction to abstract operator spaces, the interested reader is directed to [1, Chapter\n13].\nGiven an operator space V and a natural number k, one can define a new family of norms\non Mm (V ) that coincide with the matrix norms on Mm (V ) for 1 \u2264 m \u2264 k and are minimal\n(or maximal) for m > k. We will use M IN k (V ) and M AX k (V ) to denote what are called\nthe k-minimal operator space of V and the k-maximal operator space of V , respectively.\nFor X \u2208 Mm (V ) we will use X Mm (M IN k (V )) and X Mm (M AX k (V )) to denote the norms\nthat define the k-minimal and k-maximal operator spaces of V , respectively.\nFor X \u2208 Mm (V ) one can define the k-minimal and k-maximal operator space norms via\nn\no\nX Mm (M IN k (V )) := sup (\u03a6(Xij )) : \u03a6 : V \u2192 Mk with \u03a6 cb \u2264 1 and\n(2)\nn\no\nX Mm (M AX k (V )) := sup (\u03a6(Xij )) : \u03a6 : V \u2192 B(H) with idk \u2297 \u03a6 \u2264 1 .\n(3)\n\nIndeed, the names of these operator space structures come from the facts that if O(V )\nis any operator space structure on V such that k * kMm (V ) = k * kMm (O(V )) for 1 \u2264 m \u2264 k\nthen k * kMm (M IN k (V )) \u2264 |||*|||Mm (O(V )) \u2264 k * kMm (M AX k (V )) for all m > k. In the k = 1 case,\nthese operator spaces are exactly the minimal and maximal operator space structures that\nare fundamental in operator space theory [1, Chapter 14]. The interested reader is directed\nto [22] and the references therein for further properties of M IN k (V ) and M AX k (V ) when\nk \u2265 2.\nOne of the primary reasons for our interest in the k-minimal operator spaces is the\nfollowing result, which says that the k-minimal norm on Mm (Mn ) is exactly equal to the\nS(k)-norm (1) from quantum information theory.\nTheorem 1. Let X \u2208 Mm (Mn ). Then X\n\n= X\n\nMm (M IN k (Mn ))\n\nS(k)\n\n.\n\nProof. A fundamental result about completely bounded maps says (see [23, Theorem 19],\nfor example) that any completely bounded map \u03a6 : Mn \u2192 Mk has a representation of the\nform\n(4)\n\n\u03a6(Y ) =\n\nnk\nX\n\nAi Y Bi\u2217\n\ni=1\n\nwith Ai , Bi \u2208 Mk,n and\n\nnk\nX\n\nAi A\u2217i\n\nX\n\nMm (M IN k (Mn ))\n\n= sup\n\nBi Bi\u2217 = \u03a6\n\ncb\n\n= 1) and a rescaling of the\n\nnk\nnk\nn X\nX\n(Im \u2297 Ai )X(Im \u2297 Bi\u2217 ) :\nAi A\u2217i =\ni=1\n\n2\n.\ncb\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nBy using the fact that \u03a6 is completely contractive (so \u03a6\n\b\n\b\noperators Ai and Bi we have\n\nnk\nX\n\ni=1\n\nnk\nX\ni=1\n\no\nBi Bi\u2217 = 1 ,\n\n\fOPERATOR SPACES AND OPERATOR SYSTEMS IN ENTANGLEMENT THEORY\n\n5\n\n\b\n\b\nwhere the supremum is taken over all families of operators Ai , Bi \u2282 Mk,n satisfying\nthe normalization condition.

Taking the supremum over all vectors\n|vi and |wi gives the \"\u2264\" inequality.\nThe \"\u2265\" inequality can be seen by noting that if we have two vectors in their Schmidt\nP\nP\ndecompositions |vi = ki=1 \u03b1i |ci i \u2297 |ai i and |wi = ki=1 \u03b2i |di i \u2297 |bi i, then we can define\noperators A, B \u2208 Mk,n by setting their ith row in the standard basis to be hai | and hbi |,\nrespectively.

When working with an operator system (instead of an operator space) V ,\nit is more natural to define the norm (2) by taking the supremum over all completely\npositive unital maps \u03a6 : V \u2192 Mk rather than all complete contractions (similarly, to define\nthe norm (3) one would take the supremum over all k-positive unital maps rather than kcontractive maps). In this case, the k-minimal norm no longer coincides with the S(k)-norm\non Mm (Mn ) but rather has the following slightly different form:\nn\nhv|X|wi : SR(|vi), SR(|wi) \u2264 k and\nX Mm (OM IN k (Mn )) = sup\n|vi,|wi\n(7)\no\n\u2203 P \u2208 Mm s.t. (P \u2297 In )|vi = |wi ,\n\n\f6\n\nN. JOHNSTON, D. W. KRIBS, V. I. PAULSEN, AND R. PEREIRA\n\nwhere the notation OM IN k (Mn ) refers to a new operator system structure that is being\nassigned to Mn , which we discuss in detail in the next section.\nIntuitively, this norm has the same interpretation as the norm (1) except with the added\nrestriction that the vectors |vi and |wi look the same on the second subsystems. We will\nexamine this norm in more detail in Section 5. In particular, we will see in Theorem 8\nthat the norm (7) is a natural norm on the k-super minimal operator system structure (to\nbe defined in Section 4), which plays an analogous role to the k-minimal operator space\nstructure.\nNow that we have characterized the k-minimal norm in a fairly concrete way, we turn\nour attention to the k-maximal norm. The following result is a direct generalization of a\ncorresponding known characterization of the M AX(V ) norm [1, Theorem 14.2].\nTheorem 3. Let V be an operator space and let X \u2208 Mm (V ). Then\nn\nX Mm (M AX k (V )) = inf A B : A, B \u2208 Mm,rk , xi \u2208 Mk (V ), kxi kMk (V ) \u2264 1 with\no\nX = A * diag(x1 , . . . , xr ) * B \u2217 ,\n\nwhere diag(x1 , . . . , xr ) \u2208 Mrk (V ) is the r \u00d7 r block diagonal matrix with entries x1 , . . . , xr\ndown its diagonal, and the infimum is taken over all such decompositions of X.\n\nProof. The \"\u2264\" inequality follows simply from the axioms of an operator space: if X =\n(Xij ) = A * diag(x1 , . . . , xr ) * B \u2217 \u2208 Mm (V ) then\n(\u03a6(Xij )) = A * diag((idk \u2297 \u03a6)(x1 ), . . . , (idk \u2297 \u03a6)(xr )) * B \u2217 .\n\nThus\n(\u03a6(Xij )) \u2264 A\n\n\b\nB max k(idk \u2297 \u03a6)(x1 )k, . . . , k(idk \u2297 \u03a6)(xr )k .\n\nBy taking the supremum over maps \u03a6 with kidk \u2297 \u03a6k \u2264 1, the \"\u2264\" inequality follows.\nWe will now show that the infimum on the right is an L\u221e matrix norm that coincides\nwith k * kMm (V ) for 1 \u2264 m \u2264 k. The \"\u2265\" inequality will then follow from the fact that\nk * kMm (M AX k (V )) is the maximal such norm.\nFirst, denote the infimum on the right by X m,inf and fix some 1 \u2264 m \u2264 k. Then the\ninequality X Mm (V ) \u2264 X m,inf follows immediately by picking any particular decomposition X = A * diag(x1 , . . . , xr ) * B \u2217 and using the axioms of an operator space to see\nthat\n\b\nA * diag(x1 , . . . , xr ) * B \u2217 Mm (V ) \u2264 A B max kx1 k, . . . , kxr k\n\u2264\n\n\u2264\n\nA\n\nX\n\nB\n\nm,inf\n\n.\n\nThe fact that equality\nis attained by some decomposition of X comes simply from writing\n\u0001\nX = X Mm (V ) I * (X \u2295 0k\u2212m ) * I. It follows that k * kMm (V ) = k * km,inf for 1 \u2264 m \u2264 k.\nAll that remains to be proved is that k * km,inf is an L\u221e matrix norm, which we omit as\nit is directly analogous to the proof of [1, Theorem 14.2].\n\u0003\n\n\fOPERATOR SPACES AND OPERATOR SYSTEMS IN ENTANGLEMENT THEORY\n\n7\n\nAs one final note, observe that we can obtain lower bounds of the k-minimal and kmaximal operator space norms simply by choosing particular maps \u03a6 that satisfy the normalization condition of their definition. Upper bounds of the k-maximal norms can be\nobtained from Theorem 3. The problem of computing upper bounds for the k-minimal\nnorms was investigated in [14].\n4. k-Super Minimal and k-Super Maximal Operator Systems\nWe will now introduce (abstract) operator systems, and in particular the minimal and\nmaximal operator systems that were explored in [10] and the k-super minimal and k-super\nmaximal operator systems that were explored in [11]. Our introduction to general operator\nsystems will be brief, and the interested reader is directed to [1, Chapter 13] for a more\nthorough treatment.\nLet V be a complex (not necessarily normed) vector space as before, with a conjugate\nlinear involution that will be denoted by \u2217 (such a space is called a \u2217-vector space). Define\nVh := {v \u2208 V : v = v \u2217 } to be the set of Hermitian elements of V . We will say that (V, V + )\nis an ordered \u2217-vector space if V + \u2286 Vh is a convex cone satisfying V + \u2229 \u2212V + = {0}. Here\nV + plays the role of the \"positive\" elements of V \u2013 in the most familiar ordering on square\nmatrices, V + is the set of positive semidefinite matrices.\nMuch as was the case with operator spaces, an operator system is constructed by considering the spaces Mm (V ), but instead of considering various norms on these spaces that\nbehave well with the norm on V , we will consider various cones of positive elements on\nMm (V ) that behave well with the cone of positive elements V+ . To this end, given a \u2217vector space V we let Mm (V )h denote the set of Hermitian elements in Mm (V ). It is said\nthat a family of cones Cm \u2286 Mm (V )h (m \u2265 1) is a matrix ordering on V if C1 = V + and\nthey satisfy the following three properties:\n\u2022 each Cm is a cone in Mm (V )h ;\n\u2022 Cm \u2229 \u2212Cm = {0} for each m; and\n\u2022 for each n, m \u2208 N and X \u2208 Mm,n we have X \u2217 Cm X \u2286 Cn .\nA final technical restriction on V is that we will require an element e \u2208 Vh such that, for\nany v \u2208 V , there exists r > 0 such that re \u2212 v \u2208 V + (such an element e is called an order\nunit). It is said that e is an Archimedean order unit if re + v \u2208 V + for all r > 0 implies\nthat v \u2208 V + . A triple (V, C1 , e), where (V, C1 ) is an ordered \u2217-vector space and e is an\nArchimedean order unit, will be referred to as an Archimedean ordered \u2217-vector space or\nan AOU space for short. Furthermore, if e \u2208 Vh is an Archimedean order unit then we say\nthat it is an Archimedean matrix order unit if the operator em := Im \u2297 e \u2208 Mm (V ) is an\nArchimedean order unit in Cm for all m \u2265 1. We are now able to define abstract operator\nsystems:\nDefinition 4. An (abstract) operator system is a triple (V, {Cm }\u221e\nm=1 , e), where V is a\n\u2217-vector space, {Cm }\u221e\nis\na\nmatrix\nordering\non\nV\n,\nand\ne\n\u2208\nV\nis\nan\nArchimedean matrix\nh\nm=1\norder unit.\nFor brevity, we may simply say that V is an operator system, with the understanding\nthat there is an associated matrix ordering {Cm }\u221e\nm=1 and Archimedean matrix order unit\ne. Recall from [10] that for any AOU space (V, V + , e) there exists minimal and maximal\n\n\f8\n\nN. JOHNSTON, D. W. KRIBS, V. I. PAULSEN, AND R. PEREIRA\n\noperator system structure OM IN (V ) and OM AX(V ) \u2013 that is, there exist particular\n\u221e\nmax \u221e\nmin }\u221e\nfamilies of cones {Cm\nm=1 and {Cm }m=1 such that if {Dm }m=1 is any other matrix\nmax \u2286 D\nmin for all m \u2265 1. In [11] a generalization\nordering on (V, V + , e) then Cm\nm \u2286 Cm\nof these operator system structures, analogous to the k-minimal and k-maximal operator\nspaces presented in Section 3, was introduced. Given an operator system V , the k-super\nminimal operator system of V and the k-super maximal operator system of V , denoted\nOM IN k (V ) and OM AX k (V ) respectively, are defined via the following families of cones:\n\b\nmin,k\n+\nCm\n:= (Xij ) \u2208 Mm (V ) : (\u03a6(Xij )) \u2208 Mm\n\u2200 unital CP maps \u03a6 : V \u2192 Mk ,\n\b\nmax,k\n\u2217\nCm\n:= A * D * A \u2208 Mm (V ) : A \u2208 Mm,rk , D = diag(D1 , . . . , Dr ),\nDl \u2208 Mk (V )+ \u2200 l, r \u2208 N .\n\nmax,k\nIf V is infinite-dimensional then the cones Cm\nneed not define an operator system due\nto Im \u2297 e perhaps not always being an Archimedean order unit, though it was shown in [11]\nhow to Archimedeanize the space to correct this problem. We will avoid this technicality\nby working explicitly in the V = Mn case from now on.\nObserve that the interpretation of the k-super minimal and k-super maximal operator\nsystems is completely analogous to the interpretation of k-minimal and k-maximal operator\nmin,k\nmax,k\nspaces. The families of positive cones Cm\nand Cm\ncoincide with the families of\npositive cones of V for 1 \u2264 m \u2264 k, and out of all operator system structures on V with this\nproperty they are the largest (smallest, respectively) for m > k.\nmin,k\nIn terms of quantum information theory, the cones Cm\n\u2286 Mm \u2297 Mn are exactly the\nmax,k\ncones of k-block positive operators, and the cones Cm\n\u2286 Mm \u2297 Mn are exactly the\ncones of (unnormalized) density operators \u03c1 with SN (\u03c1) \u2264 k. These facts have appeared\nimplicitly in the past, but their importance merits making the details explicit:\n\nTheorem 5. Let X, \u03c1 \u2208 Mm \u2297 Mn . Then\n\nmin,k\n(a) X \u2208 Cm\nif and only if X is k-block positive; and\nmax,k\n(b) \u03c1 \u2208 Cm\nif and only if SN (\u03c1) \u2264 k.\n\nProof. To see (a), we will use techniques similar to those used in the proof of Theorem 1.\nmin,k\nUse the Choi-Kraus representation of completely positive maps so that X \u2208 Cm\nif and\nonly if\nnk\nnk\nX\nX\n\b\n\u2217\n+\nAi A\u2217i = Ik .\n(Im \u2297 Ai )X(Im \u2297 Ai ) \u2208 (Mm \u2297 Mk ) for all Ai \u2282 Mk,n with\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nNow define \u03b1ij |aij i := A\u2217i |ji and let |vi =\nunit vector.

To this\nmax,k\nend, suppose \u03c1 \u2208 Cm\n. Thus we can write \u03c1 = A * D * A\u2217 for some A \u2208 Mm,rk and\nP\nD = diag(D1 , . . . , Dr ) = rl=1 |lihl| \u2297 Dl with Dl \u2208 Mk (Mn )+ for all l. Furthermore, write\nP\nP\nDl = h dl,h |vl,h ihvl,h | where |vl,h i = ki=1 |ii \u2297 |dl,h,i i.

Recall that a map\n\u221e\n\u03a6 between operator systems (V, {Cm }\u221e\nm=1 , e) and (V, {Dm }m=1 , e) is said to be completely\npositive if (\u03a6(Xij )) \u2208 Dm whenever (Xij ) \u2208 Cm . We then have the following result that\ncharacterizes k-positive maps, entanglement-breaking maps, and k-partially entanglement\nbreaking maps as completely positive maps between these k-super minimal and k-super\nmaximal operator systems.\nCorollary 6.

What is referred to as the order norm\nof v \u2208 Vh [25] is defined via\n(10)\n\nkvkor := inf{t \u2208 R : \u2212te \u2264 v \u2264 te}.\n\nIt is not difficult to see that for a Hermitian element X = X \u2217 \u2208 Mm (V ), the matrix norm\ninduced by the matrix order (9) coincides with the order norm (10). It was shown in [25]\nhow the order norm on Mm (V )h can be extended (non-uniquely) to a norm on all of Mm (V ).\nFurthermore, there exists a minimal order norm k * km and a maximal order norm k * kM\nsatisfying k * km \u2264 k * kM \u2264 2k * km . We will now examine properties of these two norms as\nwell as some other norms (all of which coincide with the order norm on Hermitian elements)\non the k-super minimal operator system structures.\nWe will consider an operator X \u2208 Mm (OM IN k (Mn )), where recall by this we mean\nX \u2208 Mm (Mn ), where the operator system structure on the space is OM IN k (Mn ). Then\nwe recall the minimal order norm, decomposition norm k * kdec , and maximal order norm\nfrom [25]:\n\b\nX m := sup |f (X)| : f : Mm (OM IN k (Mn )) \u2192 C a pos. linear functional s.t. f (I) = 1 ,\n)\n( r\nr\nX\nX\nmin,k\n\u03bbi Pi with Pi \u2208 Cm (Mn ) and \u03bbi \u2208 C ,\n|\u03bbi |Pi\nX dec := inf\n:X =\nX\n\nM\n\n:= inf\n\n(\n\ni=1\nr\nX\ni=1\n\n|\u03bbi | Hi\n\nor\n\ni=1\n\nor\n\nr\nX\n\n:X =\n\ni=1\n\n)\n\n\u03bbi Hi with Hi = Hi\u2217 and \u03bbi \u2208 C .\n\nOur next result shows that the minimal order norm can be thought of in terms of vectors\nwith Schmidt rank no greater than k, much like the norms k * kS(k) and k * kMm (OM IN k (Mn ))\nintroduced earlier.\n\n\f12\n\nN. JOHNSTON, D. W. KRIBS, V. I. PAULSEN, AND R. PEREIRA\n\nTheorem 9. Let X \u2208 Mm (OM IN k (Mn )). Then\nn\no\nX m = sup hv|X|vi : SR(|vi) \u2264 k .\n|vi\n\nProof. Note that if we define a linear functional f : Mm (OM IN k (Mn )) \u2192 C by f (X) =\nhv|X|vi for some fixed |vi with SR(|vi) \u2264 k then it is clear that f (X) \u2265 0 whenever\nmin,k\nX \u2208 Cm\n(Mn ) (by definition of k-block positivity) and f (I) = 1. The \"\u2265\" inequality\nfollows immediately.\nTo see the other inequality, note that if X = X \u2217 = (Xij ) and |vi, |wi can be written\nP\nP\n|vi = kr=1 \u03b1r |ar i \u2297 |br i and |wi = kr=1 \u03b3r |cr i \u2297 |br i, then\nhv|X|wi =\n\nk\nX\n\nrs=1\n\n\u03b1r \u03b3s har |(hbr |Xij |bs i)ij |cs i\n\uf8eb\n\n(hb1 |Xij |b1 i)ij\n\uf8ec\n..\n= (\u03b11 ha1 |, * * * , \u03b1k hak |) \uf8ed\n.\nhbk |Xij |b1 i)ij\n\n***\n..\n.\n***\n\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nhb1 |Xij |bk i)ij\n\u03b31 |c1 i\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec .. \uf8f7\n..\n\uf8f8\uf8ed . \uf8f8.\n.\n\nhbk |Xij |bk i)ij\n\n\u03b3k |ck i\n\nBecause X is Hermitian, so is the operator in the last line above, so if we take the supremum\nover all |vi, |wi of this form, we may choose \u03b1i |ai i = \u03b3i |ci i for all i. It follows that\nn\no\nn\nsup |hv|X|vi| : SR(|vi) \u2264 k = sup hv|X|wi : SR(|vi), SR(|wi) \u2264 k and\no\n\u2203 P \u2208 Mm s.t. (P \u2297 In )|vi = |wi .\n\nThe \"\u2264\" inequality follows from Theorem 8, the fact that k * kMm (OM IN k (Mn )) is an order\nnorm, and the minimality of k * km among order norms.\n\u0003\n\nThe characterization of k * km given by Theorem 9 can be thought of as in the same vein\nas [25, Proposition 5.8], where it was shown that for a unital C\u2217 -algebra, k * km coincides\nwith the numerical radius. In our setting, k * km can be thought of as a bipartite analogue of\nthe numerical radius, which has been studied in quantum information theory in the k = 1\ncase [26].\nIn the case where X is not Hermitian, equality need not hold between any of the order\nnorms that have been introduced. We now briefly investigate how they compare to each\nother in general.\nProposition 10. Let X \u2208 Mm (OM IN k (Mn )). Then\nX\n\nm\n\n\u2264 X\n\nMm (OM IN k (Mn ))\n\n\u2264 X\n\ndec\n\n\u2264 X\n\nM\n\n.\n\nProof. The first and last inequalities follow from the fact that k * km and k * kM are the\nminimal and maximal order norms, respectively. Thus, all that needs to be shown is that\nX Mm (OM IN k (Mn )) \u2264 X dec . To this end, let |vi, |wi \u2208 Cm \u2297Cn with SR(|vi), SR(|wi) \u2264\nk be such that there exists some P \u2208 Mm such that (P \u2297 In )|vi = |wi. Then for any\nPr\nmin,k\ndecomposition X =\n(Mn ) and \u03bbi \u2208 C we can use a similar\ni=1 \u03bbi Pi with Pi \u2208 Cm\n\n\fOPERATOR SPACES AND OPERATOR SYSTEMS IN ENTANGLEMENT THEORY\n\n13\n\nargument to that used in the proof of Theorem 9 to see that hv|Pi |vi \u2265 hv|Pi |wi \u2265 0\nbecause each Pi is k-block positive (by Theorem 5). Thus\nr\nr\nr\nr\nX\nX\nX\nX\n|\u03bbi |hv|Pi |vi \u2264\n|\u03bbi |Pi .\nhv|X|wi =\n|\u03bbi | hv|Pi |wi \u2264\n\u03bbi hv|Pi |wi \u2264\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nor\n\ni=1\n\nTaking the supremum over all such vectors |vi and |wi and the infimum over all such\ndecompositions of X gives the result.\n\u0003\n\nWe know in general that k * km and k * kM can differ by at most a factor of two. We now\npresent an example some of these norms and to demonstrate that in fact even k * km and\nk * kMm (OM IN k (Mn )) can differ by a factor of two.\nExample 11. Consider the rank-1 operator X := |\u03c6ih\u03c8| \u2208 OM INnk (Mn ), where\n\nn\u22121\nn\u22121\n1 X\n1 X\n|ii \u2297 |ii\n|\u03c8i := \u221a\n|ii \u2297 |i + 1(mod n)i.\n|\u03c6i := \u221a\nn\nn\ni=0\ni=0\nP\nIt is easily verified that if |vi = ki=1 \u03b1i |ai i \u2297 |bi i then\nk n\u22121\n1 XX\nhv|X|vi =\n\u03b1r \u03b1s har |iihbr |iihj|as ihj + 1(mod n)|bs i\nn rs=1\nij=0\n\nk\nk\n\u0011 n\u22121\n\u0011\n\u0010X\nX \u0010X\n1\n\u03b1r |ar ihbr | |j + 1(mod n)i .\nhj|\n\u03b1r |ar ihbr | *\n= Tr\nn\nr=1\n\nj=0\n\nr=1\n\nIn the final line above we have the trace of an operator with rank at most k, multiplied by\nthe sum of the elements on the superdiagonal of the same operator, subject to the constraint\nk\nand\nthat the Frobenius norm of that operator is equal to 1. It follows that hv|X|vi \u2264 2n\nP\nk\u22121 \u221a1\nk\nso kXkm = 2n\n|ii\n\u2297\n(|ii\n+\n|i\n+\n1(mod\nn)i)).\n(equality can be seen by taking |vi = i=0\nPk\u22121 2k\nPk\u22121\n\u221a1\nTo see that kXkop is twice as large, consider |vi = \u221a1\ni=0 |ii\u2297|ii and |wi =\ni=0 |ii\u2297\nk\n\nk\n\n|i + 1(mod n)i. Then it is easily verified that hv|X|wi = nk . Moreover, if P \u2208 Mm is the\ncyclic permutation matrix such that P |ii = |i \u2212 1(mod n)i for all i then (P \u2297 In )|vi = |wi,\nshowing that kXkop \u2265 nk .\n6. Contractive Maps as Separability Criteria\n\nWe now investigate the completely bounded version of the k-minimal operator space\nnorms and k-super minimal operator system norms that have been introduced. We will see\nthat these completely bounded norms can be used to provide a characterization of Schmidt\nnumber analogous to its characterization in terms of k-positive maps.\nGiven operator spaces V and W , the completely bounded (CB) norm from V to W is\ndefined by\nn\no\n\u03a6 CB(V,W ) := sup (idm \u2297 \u03a6)(X) Mm (W ) : X \u2208 Mm (V ) with X Mm (V ) \u2264 1 .\nm\u22651\n\nClearly this reduces to the standard completely bounded norm of \u03a6 in the case when\nV = Mr and W = Mn . We will now characterize this norm in the case when V = Mr and\n\n\f14\n\nN. JOHNSTON, D. W. KRIBS, V. I. PAULSEN, AND R. PEREIRA\n\nW = M IN k (Mn ). In particular, we will see that the k-minimal completely bounded norm\nof \u03a6 is equal to the perhaps more familiar operator norm idk \u2297 \u03a6 \u2013 that is, the CB norm\nin this case stabilizes in much the same way that the standard CB norm stabilizes (indeed,\nin the k = n case we get exactly the standard CB norm). This result was originally proved\nin [22], but we prove it here using elementary means for completeness and clarity, and also\nbecause we will subsequently need the operator system version of the result, which can be\nproved in the same way.\nTheorem 12. Let \u03a6 : Mr \u2192 Mn be a linear map and let 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n. Then\nidk \u2297 \u03a6 = \u03a6\n\nCB(Mr ,M IN k (Mn ))\n\n.\n\nProof. To see the \"\u2264\" inequality, simply notice that Y M (M IN k (Mn )) = Y M (Mn ) for\nk\nk\nall Y \u2208 Mk (Mn ). We thus just need to show the \"\u2265\" inequality, which we do in much the\nsame manner as Smith's original proof that the standard CB norm stabilizes.\nFirst, use Theorem 1 to write\nn\no\n(11)\n\u03a6 CB(Mr ,M IN k (Mn )) = sup (idm \u2297 \u03a6)(X) S(k) : X \u2264 1 .\nm\u22651\n\nNow fix m \u2265 k and a pure state |vi \u2208 Cm \u2297 Cn with SR(|vi) \u2264 k. We begin by showing that\nthere exists an isometry V : Ck \u2192 Cm and a state |\u1e7di \u2208 Ck \u2297 Cn such that (V \u2297 In )|\u1e7di = |vi.\nP\nTo this end, write |vi in its Schmidt Decomposition |vi = ki=1 \u03b1i |ai i\u2297|bi i. Because k \u2264 m,\nwe may define an isometry V : Ck \u2192 Cm by V |ii = |ai i for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k. If we define\nP\n|\u1e7di := ki=1 \u03b1i |ii \u2297 |bi i then (V \u2297 In )|\u1e7di = |vi, as desired.\nNow choose X\u0303 \u2208 Mm (Mr ) such that X\u0303 \u2264 1 and the supremum (11) (holding m fixed)\nis attained by X\u0303. Then choose vectors |vi, |wi \u2208 Cm \u2297 Cn with SR(|vi), SR(|wi) \u2264 k such\nthat\n(idm \u2297 \u03a6)(X\u0303)\n\nS(k)\n\n= hv|(idm \u2297 \u03a6)(X\u0303)|wi .\n\nAs we saw earlier, there exist isometries V, W : Ck \u2192 Cm and unit vectors |\u1e7di, |w\u0303i \u2208 Ck \u2297Cn\nsuch that (V \u2297 In )|\u1e7di = |vi and (W \u2297 In )|w\u0303i = |wi. Thus\n(idm \u2297 \u03a6)(X\u0303)\n\nS(k)\n\n= h\u1e7d|(V \u2217 \u2297 In )(idm \u2297 \u03a6)(X\u0303)(W \u2297 In )|w\u0303i\n= h\u1e7d|(idk \u2297 \u03a6)((V \u2217 \u2297 Ir )X\u0303(W \u2297 Ir ))|w\u0303i\n\n\u2264 (idk \u2297 \u03a6)((V \u2217 \u2297 Ir )X\u0303(W \u2297 Ir ))\nn\no\n\u2264 sup (idk \u2297 \u03a6)(X) : X \u2208 Mk (Mr ) with X \u2264 1 ,\n\nwhere the final inequality comes from the fact that (V \u2217 \u2297 Ir )X\u0303(W \u2297 Ir ) \u2264 1. The desired\ninequality follows, completing the proof.\n\u0003\nWe will now show that the operator system versions of these norms have applications to\ntesting separability of quantum states. To this end, notice that if we instead consider the\ncompletely bounded norm from Mr to the k-super minimal operator systems on Mn , then\na statement that is analogous to Theorem 12 holds. Its proof can be trivially modified to\n\n\fOPERATOR SPACES AND OPERATOR SYSTEMS IN ENTANGLEMENT THEORY\n\n15\n\nshow that if \u03a6 : Mr \u2192 Mn and 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n then\nn\no\nsup hv|(idk \u2297 \u03a6)(X)|vi : X \u2264 1, X = X \u2217\nn\no\n(12)\n\u2217\n= sup hv|(idm \u2297 \u03a6)(X)|vi : X \u2264 1, X = X , SR(|vi) \u2264 k .\nm\u22651\n\nEquation (12) can be thought of as a stabilization result for the completely bounded\nversion of the norm described by Theorem 9. We could also have picked one of the other\norder norms on the k-super minimal operator systems to work with, but from now on we\nwill be working exclusively with Hermiticity-preserving maps \u03a6. So by the fact that all of\nthe operator system order norms are equal on Hermitian operators, it follows that these\nversions of their completely bounded norms are all equal as well.\nBefore proceeding, we will need to define some more notation. If \u03a6 : Mn \u2192 Mr is a linear\nmap, then we define a Hermitian version of the induced trace norm of \u03a6:\nn\no\nH\n\u03a6 tr := sup \u03a6(X) tr : X tr \u2264 1, X = X \u2217 .\nBecause of convexity of the trace norm, it is clear that the above norm is unchanged if\ninstead of being restricted to Hermitian operators, the supremum is restricted to positive\noperators or even just projections. Now by taking the dual of the left and right norms\ndescribed by Equation (12), and using the fact that the operator norm is dual to the trace\nnorm, we arrive at the following corollary:\n\nCorollary 13. Let \u03a6 : Mn \u2192 Mr be a Hermiticity-preserving linear map and let 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n.\nThen\nn\no\nH\nidk \u2297 \u03a6 tr = sup (idm \u2297 \u03a6)(\u03c1) tr : \u03c1 \u2208 Mm \u2297 Mn with SN (\u03c1) \u2264 k .\nm\u22651\n\nWe will now characterize the Schmidt number of a state \u03c1 in terms of maps that are\ncontractive in the norm described by Corollary 13. Our result generalizes the separability\ntest of [6]. We begin with a simple lemma that will get us most of the way to the linear\ncontraction characterization of Schmidt number. The k = 1 version of this lemma appeared\nas [6, Lemma 1], though our proof is more straightforward.\nLemma 14. Let \u03c1 \u2208 Mm \u2297 Mn be a density operator. Then SN (\u03c1) \u2264 k if and only if\n(idm \u2297 \u03a6)(\u03c1) \u2265 0 for all trace-preserving k-positive maps \u03a6 : Mn \u2192 M2n .\nProof. The \"only if\" implication of the proof is clear, so we only need to establish that\nif SN (\u03c1) > k then there is a trace-preserving k-positive map \u03a6 : Mn \u2192 M2n such that\n(idm \u2297 \u03a6)(\u03c1) 6\u2265 0. To this end, let \u03a8 : Mn \u2192 Mn be a k-positive map such that (idm \u2297\n\u03a8)(\u03c1) 6\u2265 0 (which we know exists by [7, 8]). Without loss of generality, \u03a8 can be scaled\nso that \u03a8 tr \u2264 n1 . Then if \u03a9 : Mn \u2192 Mn is the completely depolarizing channel defined\nby \u03a9(\u03c1) = n1 In for all \u03c1 \u2208 Mn , it follows that (\u03a9 \u2212 \u03a8)(\u03c1) \u2265 0 for all \u03c1 \u2265 0 and so the\nmap \u03a6 := \u03a8 \u2295 (\u03a9 \u2212 \u03a8) : Mn \u2192 M2n is k-positive (and easily seen to be trace-preserving).\nBecause (idm \u2297 \u03a8)(\u03c1) 6\u2265 0, we have (idm \u2297 \u03a6)(\u03c1) 6\u2265 0 as well, completing the proof.\n\u0003\n\n\f16\n\nN. JOHNSTON, D. W. KRIBS, V. I. PAULSEN, AND R. PEREIRA\n\nWe are now in a position to prove the main result of this section. Note that in the\nk = 1 case of the following theorem it is not necessary to restrict attention to Hermiticitypreserving linear maps \u03a6 (and indeed this restriction was not made in [6]), but our proof\nfor arbitrary k does make use of Hermiticity-preservation.\nTheorem 15. Let \u03c1 \u2208 Mm \u2297 Mn be a density operator. Then SN (\u03c1) \u2264 k if and only\nif (idm \u2297 \u03a6)(\u03c1) tr \u2264 1 for all Hermiticity-preserving linear maps \u03a6 : Mn \u2192 M2n with\nidk \u2297 \u03a6\n\nH\ntr\n\n\u2264 1.\n\nProof. To see the \"only if\" implication, simply use Corollary 13 with r = 2n.\nFor the \"if\" implication, observe that any positive trace-preserving map \u03a8 is necessarily\nH\nHermiticity-preserving and has \u03a8 tr \u2264 1. Letting \u03a8 = idk \u2297 \u03a6 then shows that any kpositive trace-preserving map \u03a6 has idk \u2297\u03a6\nH\ntr\n\nH\ntr\n\n\u2264 1. Thus the set of Hermiticity-preserving\n\n\u2264 1 contains the set of k-positive trace-preserving maps, so\nlinear maps \u03a6 with idk \u2297 \u03a6\nthe \"if\" implication follows from Lemma 14.\n\u0003\nAcknowledgements.
