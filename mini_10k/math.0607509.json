Introduction\nLet \u0393 be a finitely generated Kleinian group, i.e. a finitely generated discrete subgroup of Isom(H3 )(= P Sl2 (C)), the isometry group of hyperbolic 3-space. Then\n\u0393 acts on the boundary Riemann sphere S 2 (of H3 ) by conformal automorphisms.\nThe limit set of \u0393, denoted by \u039b\u0393 , is the collection of accumulation points of any\n\u0393-orbit in S 2 . The limit set is independent of the \u0393-orbit chosen. In particular, for\nany z \u2208 \u039b\u0393 , the orbit \u0393.z is dense in \u039b\u0393 . The complement S 2 \\ \u039b\u0393 is called the\ndomain of discontinuity of \u0393 and is denoted D\u0393 . The action of \u0393 on D\u0393 is properly\ndiscontinuous. Thus, the limit set \u039b\u0393 may be thought of as the locus of chaotic\ndynamics for the action of \u0393 on S 2 and it would be desirable to 'tame' it.\nMotivation and Statement of Results:\nTowards this, Thurston raises the following question (see [Thu82, Problem 14]):\nQuestion 1.1. Suppose \u0393 has the property that (H3 \u222a D\u0393 )/\u0393 is compact. Then\nis it true that the limit set of any other Kleinian group \u0393\u2032 isomorphic to \u0393 is the\ncontinuous image of the limit set of \u0393, by a continuous map taking the fixed points\nof an element \u03b3 to the fixed points of the corresponding element \u03b3 \u2032 ?\nEssentially the same question is raised by Cannon and Thurston in Section 6 of\n[CT85, CT07] in the specific context of surface Kleinian groups:\nQuestion 1.2. Suppose that a surface group \u03c01 (S) acts freely and properly discontinuously on H3 by isometries such that the quotient manifold has no accidental\nparabolics. Does the inclusion \u0129 : Se \u2192 H3 extend continuously to the boundary?\nThe authors of [CT85] point out that for a simply degenerate surface Kleinian\ngroup, this is equivalent, via the Caratheodory extension Theorem, to asking if\nthe limit set is locally connected. The most general question in this context is the\nfollowing:\nQuestion 1.3. Let \u0393 be a finitely generated Kleinian group such that the limit set\n\u039b\u0393 is connected. Is \u039b\u0393 locally connected?\nIt is a classical fact of general topology that a compact, connected, locally connected metric space X is homeomorphic to a Peano continuum, i.e. X is a continuous image of the closed interval [0, 1]. Hence, asking if the limit set is locally\nconnected is equivalent to asking if there is some parametrization by [0, 1]. Question 1.1 makes this precise by asking for an explicit parametrization. For surface\nKleinian groups, Question 1.2 asks for a parametrization of \u039b\u0393 by a circle. In this\npaper, we give a positive answer to Question 1.2.\nTheorems 7.1 and 8.6: Let \u03c1 be a representation of a surface group H(= \u03c01 (S))\ninto P Sl2 (C) without accidental parabolics. Let M denote the (convex core of )\nH3 /\u03c1(H). Further suppose that i : S \u2192 M , taking parabolic to parabolics, induces\nf of universal covers extends\na homotopy equivalence. Then the inclusion \u0129 : Se \u2192 M\n\n\fCANNON-THURSTON MAPS FOR SURFACE GROUPS\n\n3\n\nc between the compactifications of universal covers.\ncontinuously to a map \u00ee : Sb \u2192 M\nHence the limit set of \u03c1(H) is locally connected.\nIn [Mj10b] we extend the techniques of this paper to answer Question 1.1 affirmatively. The continuous boundary extensions above are called Cannon-Thurston\nmaps.\nCombining Theorems 7.1 and 8.6 with a theorem of Anderson and Maskit [AM96],\nwe have the following affirmative answer to Question 1.3:\nTheorem 8.9: Let \u0393 be a finitely generated Kleinian group with connected limit\nset \u039b. Then \u039b is locally connected.\nNote that the limit set of a finitely generated Kleinian group \u0393 is connected if\nand only if the boundary of the convex core of H3 /\u0393 is incompressible away from\ncusps.\nRelationship with The Ending Lamination Theorem:\nSeminal work of Minsky [Min10] and Brock-Canary-Minsky [BCM12], building on\nwork of Masur-Minsky [MM99, MM00], has resolved Thurston's Ending Lamination Conjecture. The Ending Lamination Theorem roughly says that for a simply\nor doubly degenerate surface Kleinian group \u0393 without accidental parabolics, the\nisometry type of the manifold M = H3 /\u0393 is determined by its end-invariants. For\na doubly degenerate group, the end-invariants are two ending laminations, one each\nfor the two geometrically infinite ends of M . For a simply degenerate group, the\nend-invariants are an ending lamination corresponding to the geometrically infinite\nend of M and a conformal structure corresponding to the geometrically finite end\nof M . The ending lamination corresponding to a geometrically infinite end may be\nregarded as a purely topological piece of data associated to the end. Thus, in the\ncontext of geometrically infinite Kleinian groups, the Ending Lamination Theorem\nroughly says that 'Topology implies Geometry': an analog of Mostow Rigidity for\ninfinite covolume Kleinian groups.\nTheorems 7.1 and 8.6 prove the existence of Cannon-Thurston maps for surface\nKleinian groups, but leave unanswered the question about the point preimages of\nthese maps. In [Mj07], we relate the point preimages of Cannon-Thurston maps for\nsimply and doubly degenerate surface Kleinian groups to ending laminations. In\nparticular, the ending lamination corresponding to a degenerate end can be recovered from the Cannon-Thurston map. More generally, since topological conjugacies\nare compatible with Cannon-Thurston maps, a topological conjugacy of \u0393\u2212 actions on limit sets comes from a biLipschitz homeomorphism of quotient manifolds.\nHence the Ending Lamination Theorem [Min10, BCM12] in conjunction with Theorems 7.1 and 8.6 and the main result of [Mj07] show that the geometry of M can\nbe recovered from the action of \u0393 on the limit set \u039b\u0393 . This justifies the slogan:\n'Dynamics on the Limit Set determines Geometry in the Interior.'\nHistory:\nSeveral authors have contributed to the theme of this paper. We shall give below a\nbrief account of the history of the problem along with some further developments\nthat use the results of this paper.\nCannon and Thurston [CT07], Minsky [Min94], Alperin, Dicks and Porti [ADP99],\nCannon and Dicks [CD02, CD06], Klarreich [Kla99], McMullen [McM01], Bowditch\n[Bow02, Bow07] and the author [Mit98b, Mit98a, Mj09, Mj11, Mj10a, Mj05] have\n\n\f4\n\nMAHAN MJ\n\nobtained partial positive answers to Questions 1.1 and 1.2. We describe some of\nthis history in brief.\nIn [Abi76], Abikoff gave an approach to a negative answer to Question 1.3. However, around 1980, Thurston realized that this approach would not work. Then,\nin a foundational paper, Cannon and Thurston [CT85] gave the first examples furnishing a positive answer to Question 1.1 for geometrically infinite surface Kleinian\ngroups; hence the term 'Cannon-Thurston map'. In approximate chronological order, the existence of Cannon-Thurston maps in the context of Kleinian groups was\nproven\n(1) by Floyd [Flo80] for geometrically finite Kleinian groups.\n(2) by Cannon and Thurston [CT85] [CT07] for fibers of closed hyperbolic 3\nmanifolds fibering over the circle and for simply degenerate groups with\nasymptotically periodic ends.\n(3) by Minsky [Min94] for closed surface groups of bounded geometry (see also\n[Mit98b, Mj10a]).\n(4) by the author [Mit98b], and independently by Klarreich [Kla99] using different methods, for hyperbolic 3-manifolds of bounded geometry with an\nincompressible core and without parabolics.\n(5) by Alperin-Dicks-Porti [ADP99] for fibers of the figure eight knot complement regarded as a fiber bundle over the circle.\n(6) by McMullen [McM01] for punctured torus groups (see also [Mj11]).\n(7) by Bowditch [Bow02, Bow07] for punctured surface groups of bounded geometry (see also [Mj09]).\n(8) by Miyachi [Miy02] for handlebody groups of bounded geometry (see also\n[Sou06]).\n(9) by the author [Mj09] for hyperbolic 3-manifolds of bounded geometry with\ncore incompressible away from cusps.\n(10) by the author [Mj11, Mj05] for special unbounded geometries.\nFurther Developments:\nIn [Mj07], we give an explicit parametrization of the limit set of a surface Kleinian\ngroup by describing the point pre-images of the Cannon-Thurston map and relating them to ending laminations. In a further followup paper [Mj10b], we answer\nQuestion 1.1 affirmatively and completely for all finitely generated Kleinian groups,\nusing some preliminary work in [DM10]. The techniques of this paper can thus be\nstrengthened to show that Cannon-Thurston maps exist in general for finitely generated Kleinian groups, thus answering a conjecture of McMullen [McM01].\nAcknowledgments: I would like to thank Jeff Brock, Dick Canary and Yair Minsky for their help during the course of this work. In particular, Minsky and Canary\nbrought a couple of critical gaps in previous versions of this paper to my notice.\nI would also like to thank Benson Farb for innumerable exciting conversations on\nrelative hyperbolicity when we were graduate students.

Special thanks are\ndue to the referee for not unwelcome pressure to re-organize a couple of unwieldy\nmanuscripts ([Mj05] and [Mj06]) into a relatively more streamlined version and also\nfor painstakingly going through all the details and making several important and\n\n\fCANNON-THURSTON MAPS FOR SURFACE GROUPS\n\n5\n\nconstructive suggestions. A major revision of this paper was done when the author\nwas visiting Universite Paris-Sud (Orsay) under the ARCUS Indo-French program.\nDedication: This paper is fondly dedicated to Gadai and Sarada for their support\nand indulgence.\n1.1. Broad Scheme of Proof. Let M be a hyperbolic 3-manifold homotopy\nequivalent to a closed hyperbolic surface S. We think of S as an embedded inf(= H3 ) denote the universal covers of\ncompressible surface in M . Let Se and M\nf the inclusion of universal covers.\nS, M respectively and \u0129 : Se \u2192 M\nGiven a hyperbolic geodesic segment \u03bb in Se lying outside a large ball about a\ne our aim is to show that the geodesic in H3 joining\nfixed reference point o \u2208 S,\ne\nthe endpoints of i(\u03bb) lies outside a large ball about ei(o) in H3 . This is sufficient to\nprove the existence of Cannon-Thurston maps (Lemma 1.8). Instead of proving this\ndirectly, our objective will be to construct a set L\u03bb (called a 'ladder') containing\nei(\u03bb) such that\ne then the ladder L\u03bb lies outside a a large ball\n(1) If \u03bb lies outside a large ball in S,\nf. It is much easier to show (and follows from an essentially elementary\nin M\nargument) that L\u03bb lies outside a a large ball than to find the exact (or even\napproximate) location of the geodesic in H3 joining the endpoints of ei(\u03bb).\nHence this approach.\nf,\n(2) L\u03bb is quasiconvex with respect to a modified (pseudo) metric dG on M\nthus forcing the dG geodesic joining the endpoints of \u03bb to lie dG \u2212close to\nL\u03bb .\n(3) The pseudometric dG is constructed in such a way that L\u03bb still controls (cf.\nLemma 2.5) the location of the hyperbolic geodesic \u03b2 h in H3 joining the\nendpoints of ei(\u03bb), thus forcing \u03b2 h to lie outside a large ball in H3 .\nFor ease of notation we shall often identify any point or subset of Se with its\nimage under ei.\n1.1.1. The Ladder: One of the main steps in proving the sufficient condition of\nLemma 1.8 (and hence concluding the existence of Cannon-Thurston maps) is to\nconstruct a quasiconvex 'hyperbolic ladder' as in [Mit98b] and [Mit98a] containing\n\u03bb. Suppose that a sequence {Si } of disjoint, equispaced, embedded, bounded geometry surfaces exiting an end E of M has been 'judiciously' constructed. We shall\ndescribe a little later what 'judicious' means. We think of {Si } as a sequence of\nsurfaces exiting a vertical end E. Identify S with the base surface S0 .\nChoose a basepoint in S and fix a lift p of the base-point in Se as the origin. Let\nr be a quasigeodesic ray in M , starting at p, exiting E and making linear progress\nas it exits E. Suppose \u03bb = [a, b] \u2282 Se is a geodesic in the intrinsic metric on Se\njoining two lifts a(= a0 ) and b(= b0 ) of p. Let ra , rb be the lifts of r starting at a, b\nrespectively. Let ai (resp. bi ) be the point at which ra (resp. rb ) intersects Sei . Let\n\u03bbi be the geodesic in the intrinsic metric on Sei joining\nai , bi . The ladder associated\nS\nto the sequence {Si } and the geodesic \u03bb is L\u03bb = i \u03bbi . To prove quasiconvexity of\nS\nS\nL\u03bb we construct a retraction \u03a0\u03bb of i Sei onto L\u03bb = i \u03bbi by defining \u03a0\u03bb on Sei as\nthe nearest point retraction onto \u03bbi in the intrinsic metric on Sei . We would like to\nensure that \u03a0\u03bb is coarsely Lipschitz. The construction of L\u03bb and \u03a0\u03bb is detailed in\nSection 5.\n\n\f6\n\nMAHAN MJ\n\nThe ladder L\u03bb has the following property that we want: If \u03bb lies outside a large\ne then L\u03bb lies outside a large ball about the origin in M\nf.\nball about the origin in S,\nThis construction works exactly for 3-manifolds of bounded geometry, where the\nSi 's may be chosen such that\n(1) Equispaced Condition: the regions between Si and Si+1 are uniformly\nbiLipschitz to Si \u00d7 [0, 1] (for all i).\n(2) Quasi-isometry Condition: The map from Sei to Sg\ni+1 that takes (x, i) to\n(x, i + 1) is a uniform quasi-isometry.\nBoth of these break down in general. In fact, quasiconvexity of L\u03bb is not in\nf for the choice of the sequence {Si } we\ngeneral true in the hyperbolic metric on M\ndescribe below.\nThe technical tool we shall use to address this issue in this paper is electric geometry and relative hyperbolicity (Section 2). Let H = {Hi } be a collection of quasiconvex subsets of H3 . The electric (pseudo) metric obtained by electrocuting elements\nof H essentially allows one to travel for free within any Hi . However, this metric\nhas the crucial feature that electric geodesics control hyperbolic geodesics (Lemma\n2.5) and hence allows recovery of hyperbolic geodesics from electric geodesics. We\nemphasize that it is quasiconvexity of Hi 's that allows this recovery.\n\n1.1.2. A motivational special case of Split Geometry: We describe first a special\ncase of the model geometry of a geometrically infinite unbounded geometry end E.\nThis will be a particular case of what is referred to as 'split geometry' later on in\nthe paper, and is representative in a sense to be explicated. (The model geometry\ndescribed here was called 'graph amalgamation geometry' in [Mj05]). Suppose we\nhave the following situation:\n(1) there exists a sequence {Si } of disjoint, embedded, bounded geometry surfaces exiting E. These are ordered in a natural way along E, i.e. i < j\nimplies that Sj is contained in the unbounded component of E \\ Si . The\ntopological product region between Si and Si+1 is denoted Bi .\n(2) corresponding to each such product region Bi , there exists a Margulis tube\nTi such that Ti \u2282 Bi . Further, Ti \u2229 Si and Ti \u2229 Si+1 are annuli on Si and\nSi+1 respectively, with core curves homotopic to the core curve of Ti .\nWe think of the Margulis tube Ti as 'splitting' the block Bi and hence the surfaces\nSi and Si+1 . (See figure below.) The complementary components Kij of Bi \\ Ti\ng\ne\nand their lifts K\nij to E will play a special role later.\n\n\fCANNON-THURSTON MAPS FOR SURFACE GROUPS\n\n7\n\nFigure: A special case of split geometry\nNote that we have no control on the geometry of the complementary components\nKij . So the only thing we can do with them is to electrocute them and lose the\ngeometry contained within any such component. Electrocuting Kij 's forces Si and\nSi+1 to be equispaced (about distance one apart from each other). It is in this\nmodified electric metric that the sequence {Si } satisfies both the Equispaced Condition and the Quasi-isometry Condition above and the ladder construction can go\nthrough.\ng\ne\nIt will turn out that the universal covers K\nij \u2282 E are quasiconvex in a certain\nweak sense. Thus, we can electrocute such components and still hope to recover\nhyperbolic geodesics from electric geodesics using Lemma 2.5.\n1.1.3. Choice of the sequence of surfaces: We shall first describe a couple of restrictive assumptions on a degenerate end that reduce it to the above model geometry.\nWe shall then state (very briefly) how one needs to modify the above model to\nobtain a model geometry for a general degenerate end.\nThe Special Case: We give a brief sketch of the simplifying assumptions on a\ngeneral degenerate end that leads us to a model geometry and a choice of a sequence\n{Si } as above. First one needs a linear order on incompressible (but not necessarily\nembedded) surfaces in E. It is at this stage that we need Minsky's model manifold from [Min10], and more generally the hierarchy machinery from [MM00]. The\nmodel manifold of [Min10] does not quite furnish a sequence of complete surfaces\nexiting E, but rather a sequence of pants decompositions of S exiting E. A sequence\n{Pm } of pants decompositions of S exiting E means the following. Fix an isometry\ntype P of a pair of pants. Let \u03c4m denote the simple multicurve on S forming the\nboundary curves of the pants decomposition Pm . Then the complement of a thin\n(open) annular neighborhood of \u03c4m in S can be identified with Pm . We demand\nthat this complementary region (identified with Pm ) can be embedded in E such\nthat Pm with the inherited metric is of uniformly bounded geometry, i.e. each pair\nof pants (component) in Pm is uniformly biLipschitz to P. We demand further that\neach such embedding of Pm can be extended to a topological embedding Sm of S\nand these topological embeddings {Sm } exit the end E.\nThe sequence {Pm } of (boundary curves of) pants decompositions exiting E is\noften referred to as a resolution. The sequence {Pm } in [Min10] is chosen in such a\n\n\f8\n\nMAHAN MJ\n\nway that the boundary curves of the pants decompositions {Pm } occurring in the\nresolution have short geodesic realization in E.\nEach pants decomposition gives a simplex in the curve complex CC(S) of the\nsurface S. Hence the resolution furnishes a special kind of a path of simplices in\nCC(S). Associated to such a path is a geodesic of simplices in CC(S) called a tight\ngeodesic [Min10]. A tight geodesic furnishes a 'tight sequence' * * * , \u03c4i , \u03c4i+1 , * * * of\nmulticurves on the surface S. (Note the difference between the suffixes i and m\nat this stage. This indicates that we are actually passing to a subsequence.) This\nmaterial is detailed in Section 3.\nSimplifying Assumption 1: Assume, for simplicity, that for all i, the length of\nexactly one curve in \u03c4i is sufficiently small, less than the Margulis constant in\nparticular.\nCall the short curve \u03c4i for convenience. The surface Si corresponds (roughly) to\nthe first occurrence of the vertex \u03c4i in the resolution. Since \u03c4i is short, the Margulis\ntube Ti corresponding to it splits both Si and Si+1 .\nSimplifying Assumption 2: Assume further that that the surfaces Si have injectivity\nradius uniformly bounded below, i.e. the tube Ti is trapped entirely between Si\nand Si+1 .\nThe product region Bi between Si and Si+1 will be called a split block as it is\nsplit by Ti . This situation (an end E satisfying Simplifying Assumptions 1 and 2)\ngives us the model geometry (special case of split geometry) described above.\nThe General Case: The construction of the sequence {Si } in general (without\nthe simplifying assumptions of the special case) is described in detail in Section 4.1.\nHere we content ourselves by providing a couple of caveats.\nNote first that Bi \\Ti might be very far from a metric product. Thus electrocution\nis a necessity to make the Si 's equispaced.\nWe point out further that in general (when Simplifying Assumption 2 is no longer\nvalid) the Margulis tube Ti may not be entirely contained in Bi , but may extend\ninto Bi+1 or Bi\u22121 . As a result the surface Si may have a thin part contained\nentirely in Ti , destroying the product structure of Bi .\nTo address this issue, we shall excise the interiors of Margulis tubes and 'weld'\nthe 'vertical sides' (see previous figure) of Ti together. The resulting manifold\nis called the welded model manifold Mwel . Mwel is thus a quotient space of M\nhomeomorphic to M itself. In the previous schematic figure, the thick dark vertical\nrectangle denotes a section of the Margulis tube Ti . The quotient map identifies\nthe vertical sides of this vertical rectangle and collapses the horizontal I\u2212direction\nto a point (Ti should be thought of as a product of the dark vertical rectangle with\na circle). We shall also construct a new (pseudo) metric dtel on Bi after welding\nthe vertical sides (the 'welded blocks'). This process is called tube electrocution and\nis carried out on the welded model manifold Mwel rather than the model manifold\nitself in Section 4.3. The pseudometric dtel on the welded manifold Mwel roughly\ngives zero length to all horizontal circles of Ti and a uniformly bounded length to\nthe vertical direction.\ne of components of Bi \\ Ti\n1.1.4. Split Geometry and Graph Quasiconvexity: Lifts K\n]\nto the universal cover Mwel are called split components. We construct an auxiliary\n]\nmetric dG called the graph (pseudo) metric on M\nwel by electrocuting the family\n\n\fCANNON-THURSTON MAPS FOR SURFACE GROUPS\n\n9\n\n]\nof split components in M\nwel . What this means is that for each split component\ne \u00d7 {0} with K\ne \u2282 M\ne \u2282 M\ne \u00d7 [0, 1 ], identifying K\n]\n]\nK\nwe\nattach\na\ncopy\nof K\nwel\nwel\n2\n1\ne\nand equipping K \u00d7 { 2 } with the zero metric. (This is slightly different from Farb's\nconing construction [Far98].) A crucial fact we prove in Sections 4.4 and 4.6 is that\ne has uniformly bounded diameter in the graph\nthe hyperbolic convex hull CH(K)\ne is uniformly graph-quasiconvex as any\nmetric dG . We describe this by saying that K\ne\nhyperbolic geodesic joining points in K lies in a uniformly bounded neighborhood\ne in the dG -metric. It follows that (M\n]\nof K\nwel , dG ) is a (Gromov)-hyperbolic metric\n]\nspace. Equivalently, Mwel is weakly hyperbolic relative to the collection of split\ncomponents. Note that we cannot in general use strong relative hyperbolicity as\nf1 , K\nf2 \u2282 M\n]\ntwo adjacent split components K\nwel intersect along a lift of a welded\nMargulis tube. This issue is responsible for much of the strife in the Recovery Step\nbelow (Sections 6.4 and 6.5).\n]\nGromov-hyperbolicity of (M\nwel , dG ) ensures quasiconvexity of the ladder L\u03bb in\n]\n(Mwel , dG ) whose construction is described above. This is proven in Section 5.\n1.1.5. Recovery of Hyperbolic Geodesics: There is a fair bit of technical difficulty\nat this stage. The graph metric is constructed on the welded model manifold. So\nwe have to have a way of getting back to the model manifold from the welded\nmodel manifold. To do this, we note that the complement of the Margulis tubes in\nthe model manifold and the complement of the welded tubes in the welded model\nmanifold are the same. This allows us to construct a pseudometric quasi-isometric\nto dG on the model manifold M itself. Abusing notation slightly, we call this\npseudometric dG also.\nf are obtained from those of M\n]\nThe split components of M\nwel by adjoining certain\nf\nMargulis tubes. Weak relative hyperbolicity of M relative to the collection of\nsplit components gives us control over hyperbolic geodesics in terms of geodesics\n]\nin (M\nwel , dG ). The process of recovering a hyperbolic geodesic from a geodesic in\n]\n(M\nwel , dG ) is detailed in Sections 6.4 and 6.5. A more detailed sketch of the scheme\nof recovery is given in Section 6.1.\n1.1.6. A Flowchart of Main Ideas: Here is a mnemonic flow-chart of the above\nscheme that may be useful:\nf \u2212\u2192 M\n]\n\u2022 M\nwel (welding)\n]\n]\n\u2022 M\n\u2212\u2192\n(M\nwel\nwel , dtel ) (tube-electrocution)\n]\n]\n\u2022 (Mwel , dtel ) \u2212\u2192 (M\nwel , dG ) (split-component-electrocution)\nf\nf (recovery)\n]\n\u2022 (M\n,\nd\n)\n\u2212\u2192\n(\nM\n,\ndG ) \u2212\u2192 M\nwel G\n\nThe principal purpose behind carrying out each of these steps is given below in\nbrief:\n\u2022 Welding allows us to construct a sequence of bounded geometry surfaces\nexiting the end(s) of Mwel , though such a sequence might not exist in M .\nThe sequence of bounded geometry surfaces permits us to construct the\n]\nladder L\u03bb in M\nwel .\n\u2022 Tube electrocution and split-component-electrocution ensure both the Equispaced Condition and the Quasi-isometry condition. In a certain sense\ntherefore, the two electrocution steps allow us to reduce the problem to\n\n\f10\n\nMAHAN MJ\n\na model satisfying Conditions (1) and (2) of the bounded geometry case.\nWe can (as in the bounded geometry case) show that L\u03bb is quasiconvex in\n]\n(M\nwel , dG ).\n]\n\u2022 Quasiconvexity of L\u03bb furnishes a dG \u2212quasigeodesic in M\nwel contained in\nL\u03bb joining the end-points of \u03bb.\nf\n]\n\u2022 Finally, the recovery step allows us to come back from (M\nwel , dG ) to M via\nf\n(M , dG ).\n1.1.7. Outline of the paper: We recall the notions of relative hyperbolicity and electric geometry (cf. [Far98]) in Section 2 and derive some consequences that will be\nuseful in this paper. In Section 3, we collect together features of the model manifold constructed by Minsky in [Min10] and proven to be a biLipschitz model for\nsimply and doubly degenerate manifolds by Brock-Canary-Minsky in [BCM12]. In\nSection 4, we select out a sequence of split surfaces from the split surfaces occurring in the model manifold and proceed to 'fill' the intermediate spaces between\nsuccessive split surfaces by special blocks homeomorphic to S \u00d7 I. This gives us\na 'split geometry' model for simply and doubly degenerate manifolds. We make\ncrucial use of electric geometry and relative hyperbolicity at this stage. In Section\n5, we construct a quasiconvex (Gromov) 'hyperbolic ladder' in the (Gromov) hyperbolic electric space constructed in Section 4 and use it to construct a quasigeodesic\nin the electric metric joining the endpoints of \u03bb. In Section 6, we recover information about the hyperbolic geodesic joining the endpoints of \u03bb from the electric\ngeodesic constructed in Section 5. In Section 7 we put all the ingredients together\nto prove the existence of Cannon-Thurston maps for closed surface Kleinian groups\n(Theorem 7.1). In Section 8 we describe the modifications necessary for punctured\nsurfaces.\n1.1.8. Notation: We shall in general use N (resp. N h ) to denote (the convex core\nof) a simply or doubly degenerate hyperbolic 3-manifold without (resp. with) cusps.\nFor a manifold N h with cusps, N will also denote N h minus an open neighborhood\nof the cusps. M will denote the model manifold (Section 3).\nSimilarly S (resp. S h ) shall denote a closed (resp. finite volume with cusps)\nhyperbolic surface. For a surface S h with cusps, S will also denote S h minus an\nopen neighborhood of the cusps. We shall sometimes use S to denote a biLipschitz\nhomeomorphic image of a hyperbolic S. Thus M, N will both be homeomorphic to\nS \u00d7 J where J = [0, \u221e) or R according as N is simply or doubly degenerate.\nSince we shall not have specific need for manifolds with cusps till the last Section\nof this paper, N will denote (the convex core of) a simply or doubly degenerate\nhyperbolic 3-manifold without cusps unless otherwise mentioned.\nd will denote the hyperbolic (or biLipschitz to hyperbolic) metric on S. dM will\ndenote the metric on the model manifold.\n1.2. Gromov Hyperbolic Metric Spaces and Cannon-Thurston Maps. We\nstart off with some preliminaries about hyperbolic metric spaces in the sense of\nGromov [Gro85]. For details, see [CDP90], [GdlH90]. Let (X, dX ) be a (Gromov)\nhyperbolic metric space. The Gromov boundary of X, denoted by \u2202X, is the\ncollection of equivalence classes of geodesic rays r : [0, \u221e) \u2192 X with r(0) = x0 for\nsome fixed x0 \u2208 X, where rays r1 and r2 are equivalent if sup{dX (r1 (t), r2 (t))} < \u221e.\n\n\fCANNON-THURSTON MAPS FOR SURFACE GROUPS\n\n11\n\nb = X \u222a \u2202X denote the natural compactification of X topologized the usual\nLet X\nway (cf.[GdlH90] pg. 124).\nWe denote the k-neighborhood of a subset Z of (X, dX ) by Nk (Z, dX ) or simply\nNk (Z) when dX is understood.\nDefinition 1.4. A subset Z of (X, dX ) is said to be k-quasiconvex if any geodesic joining points of Z lies in a k-neighborhood Nk (Z, dX ) of Z. A subset Z is\nquasiconvex if it is k-quasiconvex for some k.\nFor simply connected real hyperbolic manifolds this is equivalent to saying that\nthe convex hull CH(Z) of the set Z lies in a bounded neighborhood of Z. We shall\nhave occasion to use this alternate characterization.\nDefinition 1.5. A map f from one metric space (Y, dY ) into another metric space\n(Z, dZ ) is said to be a (K, \u01eb)-quasi-isometric embedding if\n1\nK (dY\n\n(y1 , y2 )) \u2212 \u01eb \u2264 dZ (f (y1 ), f (y2 )) \u2264 KdY (y1 , y2 ) + \u01eb\n\nIf f is a quasi-isometric embedding, and every point of Z lies at a uniformly\nbounded distance from some f (y) then f is said to be a quasi-isometry.\nA (K, \u01eb)-quasi-isometric embedding that is a quasi-isometry will be called a\n(K, \u01eb)-quasi-isometry.\nA (K, \u01eb)-quasigeodesic is a (K, \u01eb)-quasi-isometric embedding of a closed interval in R. A (K, K)-quasigeodesic will also be called a K-quasigeodesic. A\n(K, K)-quasigeodesic will simply be called a K-quasigeodesic\nWe shall say that two paths \u03b1, \u03b2 in X 'C-track' each other in A \u2282 X if \u03b1 \u2229 A\nand \u03b2 \u2229 A lie in a C neighborhood of each other. The following Lemma says that\nquasigeodesics starting and ending close by track each other.\nLemma 1.6. [GdlH90] Let (X, d) be a \u03b4-hyperbolic metric space. Then for any\nK, \u01eb, D there exists C = C(\u03b4, K, \u01eb, D) such that if \u03b1, \u03b2 are two (K, \u01eb)-quasi-geodesics\nwhose starting points (as also ending points) are at most D apart, then \u03b1 \u2282\nNC (\u03b2, d).\nThe conclusion of Lemma 1.6 above is also summarized by saying that \u03b1, \u03b2\nC\u2212fellow travel each other and this property of quasi-geodesics is called the C\u2212fellow\ntraveler property.\nLet (X, dX ) be a (Gromov) hyperbolic metric space and Y be a subspace that is\n(Gromov) hyperbolic with the inherited path metric dY . By adjoining the Gromov\nb and Yb\nboundaries \u2202X and \u2202Y to X and Y , one obtains their compactifications X\nrespectively.\nLet i : Y \u2192 X denote inclusion.\nDefinition 1.7. Let X and Y be (Gromov) hyperbolic metric spaces and i : Y \u2192 X\nb is a continuous\nbe an embedding. A Cannon-Thurston map \u00ee from Yb to X\nextension of i.\nThe following lemma (Lemma 2.1 of [Mit98a]) says that a Cannon-Thurston map\nexists if for all M > 0 and y \u2208 Y , there exists N > 0 such that if \u03bb lies outside\nan N ball around y in Y then any geodesic in X joining the end-points of \u03bb lies\noutside the M ball around i(y) in X. For convenience of use later on, we state this\nsomewhat differently and include the proof from [Mj10a] for completeness.\n\n\f12\n\nMAHAN MJ\n\nb exists if the following condiLemma 1.8. A Cannon-Thurston map from Yb to X\ntion is satisfied:\nGiven y0 \u2208 Y , there exists a non-negative function M (N ), such that M (N ) \u2192 \u221e\nas N \u2192 \u221e and for all geodesic segments \u03bb lying outside an N -ball around y0 \u2208 Y\nany geodesic segment in X joining the end-points of i(\u03bb) lies outside the M (N )-ball\naround i(y0 ) \u2208 X.\nProof. Suppose i : Y \u2192 X does not extend continuously . Since i is proper, there\nexist sequences xm , ym \u2208 Y and p \u2208 \u2202Y , such that xm \u2192 p and ym \u2192 p in Yb , but\nb where u, v \u2208 \u2202X and u 6= v.\ni(xm ) \u2192 u and i(ym ) \u2192 v in X,\nSince xm \u2192 p and ym \u2192 p, any geodesic in Y joining xm and ym lies outside\nan Nm -ball y0 \u2208 Y , where Nm \u2192 \u221e as m \u2192 \u221e. Any bi-infinite geodesic in X\njoining u, v \u2208 \u2202X has to pass through some M -ball around i(y0 ) in X as u 6= v.\nThere exist constants c and L such that for all m > L any geodesic joining i(xm )\nand i(ym ) in X passes through an (M + c)-neighborhood of i(y0 ). Since (M + c) is\na constant not depending on the index m this proves the lemma.\n\u0003\nThe above result can be interpreted as saying that a Cannon-Thurston map exists\nif the space of geodesic segments in Y embeds properly in the space of geodesic\nsegments in X.\n2. Relative Hyperbolicity\nIn this section, we shall recall first certain notions of relative hyperbolicity due\nto Farb [Far98], Klarreich [Kla99], Bowditch [Bow97] and the author [Mj11].\n2.1. Electric Geometry. We collect together certain facts about the electric metric that Farb proves in [Far98].\nDefinition 2.1.\nF Given a metric space (X, dX ) and a collection H of subsets, let\nE(X, H) = X H\u2208H (H \u00d7 [0, 12 ]) be the identification space obtained by identifying\n(h, 0) \u2208 H \u00d7 [0, 21 ] with h \u2208 X. Each {h} \u00d7 [0, 21 ] is declared to be isometric to the\ninterval [0, 12 ] and H \u00d7 { 21 } is equipped with the zero metric.\nA path \u03c3 : I \u2192 E(X, H) is said to be distinguished if \u03c3(I) \u2229 {h} \u00d7 (0, 21 ) is\neither empty or all of {h} \u00d7 (0, 21 ). The distance between two points in E(X, H) is\ndefined to be the infimum of the lengths of distinguished paths between them.\nThe resulting pseudo-metric space E(X, H) is the electric space associated to\nX and the collection H.\nWe shall say that E(X, H) is constructed from X by electrocuting the collection\nH and the induced pseudo-metric de will be called the electric metric.\nIf E(X, H) is (Gromov) hyperbolic, we say that X is weakly hyperbolic relative\nto H.\nThe notion of electrocution above is slightly different from the coning construction introduced by Farb in [Far98], inasmuch as Farb [Far98]) collapses H \u00d7 { 21 }\nto a point. Thus ours is a geometric (as opposed to topological) version of Farb's\nconstruction. All paths in E(X, H) will henceforth be assumed to be distinguished.\nIf X is a geodesic metric space and each H \u2208 H is closed, then (E(X, H), de ) is a\ngeodesic (pseudo) metric space. Geodesics and quasigeodesics in (E(X, H), de ) will\nbe referred to as electric geodesics and electric quasigeodesics respectively.\n\n\fCANNON-THURSTON MAPS FOR SURFACE GROUPS\n\n13\n\nF\nNote that since E(X, H) = X H\u2208H (H \u00d7 [0, 21 ]), X can be naturally identified\nwith a subspace of E(X, H). Paths in (X, dX ) (in particular geodesics and quasigeodesics) can therefore be regarded as paths in E(X, H).\nA collection H of subsets of (X, dX ) is said to be D-separated if dX (H1 , H2 ) \u2265 D\nfor all H1 , H2 \u2208 H; H1 6= H2 . D-separatedness is only a technical restriction as the\ncollection {H \u00d7 { 21 } : H \u2208 H} is 1-separated in E(X, H).\nDefinition 2.2. Given a collection H of C-quasiconvex, D-separated sets in a\n(Gromov) hyperbolic metric space (X, dX ) and a number \u01eb we shall say that a\ngeodesic (resp. quasigeodesic) \u03b3 is a geodesic (resp. quasigeodesic) without backtracking with respect to \u01eb\u2212 neighborhoods if \u03b3 does not return to N\u01eb (H, dX ) after\nleaving it, for any H \u2208 H. A geodesic (resp. quasigeodesic) \u03b3 is a geodesic (resp.\nquasigeodesic) without backtracking if it is a geodesic (resp. quasigeodesic) without\nbacktracking with respect to \u01eb neighborhoods for \u01eb = 0.\nNotation: For any pseudo metric space (Z, \u03c1) and A \u2282 Z, we shall use the notation\nNR (A, \u03c1) = {x \u2208 Z : \u03c1(x, A) \u2264 R} as for metric spaces.\nLemma 2.3. (Lemma 4.5 and Proposition 4.6 of [Far98]; Theorem 5.3 of [Kla99];\n[Bow97])\nGiven \u03b4, C, D there exists \u2206 such that if (X, dX ) is a \u03b4-hyperbolic metric space with\na collection H of C-quasiconvex D-separated sets. then,\n1) Electric quasi-geodesics electrically track (Gromov) hyperbolic geodesics: For\nall P > 0, there exists K > 0 such that if \u03b2 is any electric P -quasigeodesic from x\nto y, and \u03b3 is a geodesic in (X, dX ) from x to y, then \u03b2 \u2282 NK (\u03b3, de ).\n2) \u03b3 \u2282 NK ((N0 (\u03b2, de )), dX ).\n3) Relative Hyperbolicity: X is weakly hyperbolic relative to H. E(X, H) is \u2206hyperbolic.\nLet (X, dX ) be a \u03b4-hyperbolic metric space, and H a family of C-quasiconvex,\nD-separated, collection of subsets. Then X is weakly hyperbolic relative to H\n[Bow97]. Let \u03b1 = [a, b] be a geodesic in (X, dX ) and \u03b2 an electric quasigeodesic\nwithout backtracking (in E(X, H)) joining a, b. Order from the left the collection of\nmaximal subsegments of \u03b2 contained entirely in some H \u00d7 12 for some H \u2208 H. Since\n\u03b2 is a distinguished path (by our blanket assumption about paths in E(X, H)), any\nsuch maximal subsegment can be extended by adjoining vertical subsegments at\nits end-points to obtain a path of the form {p} \u00d7 [0, 12 ] \u222a [p \u00d7 21 , q \u00d7 21 ] \u222a {q} \u00d7\n[0, 12 ]. We shall refer to these subpaths of \u03b2 as extended maximal subsegments.\nReplace, as per the above ordering, extended maximal subsegment with end-points\np, q (say) by a geodesic [p, q] in (X, dX ). (Note here that as per the definition\nof E(X, H), (p, 0) \u2208 E(X, H) is identified with p \u2208 X; similarly for (q, 0) and q.)\nThe resulting connected path \u03b2q is called an electro-ambient representative of \u03b2\nin X. Also, if \u03b2 is an electric P -quasigeodesic (resp. (K, \u01eb)-quasigeodesic) without\nbacktracking (in E(X, H)), then \u03b2q is called an electro-ambient P -quasigeodesic\n(resp. electro-ambient (K, \u01eb)-quasigeodesic). If \u03b2 is an electric geodesic (i.e.\na (1, 0)-quasigeodesic) without backtracking (in E(X, H)), then \u03b2q is simply called\nan electro-ambient quasigeodesic.\nRemark 2.4. We emphasize a point about the terminology we use here. An\nelectro-ambient quasigeodesic in our sense is the same as an electro-ambient (1, 0)quasigeodesic, not an electro-ambient (K, \u01eb)-quasigeodesic for some K, \u01eb.\n\n\f14\n\nMAHAN MJ\n\nNote that \u03b2q need not be a (Gromov) hyperbolic quasigeodesic. However, the\nproof of Proposition 4.3 of Klarreich [Kla99] gives the following.\nLemma 2.5. (See Proposition 4.3 of [Kla99], also see Lemma 3.10 of [Mj11]) Given\n\u03b4, C, P there exists C3 such that the following holds:\nLet (X, dX ) be a \u03b4-hyperbolic metric space and H a family of C-quasiconvex, collection of quasiconvex subsets. Let (E(X, H), de ) denote the electric space obtained\nby electrocuting elements of H. Then, if \u03b1, \u03b2q denote respectively a (Gromov) hyperbolic geodesic and an electro-ambient P -quasigeodesic with the same end-points\nin X, then \u03b1 lies in a (Gromov hyperbolic dX \u2212) C3 neighborhood of \u03b2q .\nFor the convenience of the reader, we illustrate the content of Lemma 2.5 by the\nfigure below:\n\nFigure: Hyperbolic geodesic lies in a neighborhood of an electro-ambient quasigeodesic\nIn the above figure, the straight line below indicates a hyperbolic geodesic, and\nthe broken line built up of curves depicts an electro-ambient quasigeodesic.\nProof of Lemma 2.5: The proof follows Proposition 4.3 of Klarreich [Kla99]\nclosely. Let \u03b1 = [a, b](\u2282 X) be a geodesic and let \u03b2 = ab(\u2282 E(X, H)) be an electric\nP -quasigeodesic with the same end-points. Further, suppose that, for each H \u2208 H,\n\u03b2 \u2229 (H \u00d7 { 21 }) is\na) a maximal subsegment of \u03b2 contained in H \u00d7 { 21 },\nb) \u03b2 \u2229 (H \u00d7 { 21 }) is a geodesic in H \u00d7 { 12 } with respect to the intrinsic metric on\nH(= H \u00d7 { 21 }).\nFor the purposes of this proof, we shall need to deal with two metrics (more\nprecisely a metric and a pseudometric) on the topological space E(X, H):\na) The first is the electric (pseudo) metric S\nde described above.\nb) The other is the (genuine) metric on X H\u2208H H \u00d7 [0, 21 ] obtained as a quotient\nspace of X along with copies of H \u00d7 [0, 12 ]. We call this metric dq .\nThus de is obtained from dq by redefining distance between points on H \u00d7 { 21 }\nto be zero.\nRecall that (by construction) the electro-ambient quasigeodesic \u03b2q is obtained\nfrom \u03b2 by \"projecting\" maximal subsegments of \u03b2 to X. It therefore suffices to\nshow that \u03b1 lies in a (uniformly) bounded neighborhood of \u03b2 in (E(X, H), dq ).\nLet a = a0 , a1 , * * * , an , an+1 = b be a sequence of points on \u03b2 such that for all\ni, a2i a2i+1 (\u2282 ab) are maximal subsegments in Hi \u00d7 { 21 } for some Hi \u2208 H. Also,\nassume that n is maximal, i.e. for all i, a2i\u22121 a2i is a union of three segments:\n\n\fCANNON-THURSTON MAPS FOR SURFACE GROUPS\n\n15\n\na) a vertical segment of the form a2i\u22121 \u00d7[0, 12 ] traced from a2i\u22121 \u00d7{ 21 } to a2i\u22121 \u00d7{0},\nb) a geodesic in (X, dX ) from a2i\u22121 (identified with a2i\u22121 \u00d7 {0}) to a2i (identified\nwith a2i \u00d7 {0}),\nc) a vertical segment of the form a2i \u00d7 [0, 21 ] traced from a2i \u00d7 {0} to a2i \u00d7 { 12 }.\nNote first that the collection {H \u00d7 { 21 }}, H \u2208 H is automatically 1\u2212 separated.\nHence de (a2i\u22121 , a2i ) \u2265 1.\nWith this setup, the proof is a small reworking of Proposition 4.3 of [Kla99].\nChoose an R > 0. Let z \u2208 [a, b] be a point for which no point of \u03b2 = ab lies within\nR of z. Let (p, q) be a maximal subsegment of [a, b] containing z such that no point\nof \u03b2 = ab lies within R of (p, q).\nLet p1 \u2208 ab and q1 \u2208 ab be points in ab closest to p, q respectively (with respect to\nthe metric dq ). Let p1 q1 be the subpath of ab between p1 , q1 . Also, let aj , * * * , aj+l\nbe the collection of vertices in ab between p1 , q1 . Then the proof of Proposition 4.3\nof [Kla99] shows that there exists R0 depending on \u03b4, C, P such that for all R \u2265 R0 ,\nl(= (j + l) \u2212 j) is bounded in terms of R, \u03b4, C, P . (This is essentially because l\ngrows like dX (p, q)eR , cf. [Far98].) Let l(R) be this bound for l.\nChoosing R = R0 , we find that (p, q) is contained in a (2R0 + (l(R0 ) + 4)\u03b4)\u2212\nneighborhood of \u03b2 = ab. This completes the proof. \u2737\nDefinition 2.6. [Far98] Two paths \u03b2, \u03b3 in (X, dX ) with the same endpoints are\nsaid to have similar intersection patterns with H if there exists D > 0, depending\nonly on (X, H), such that:\n\u2022 Similar Intersection Patterns 1: If precisely one of {\u03b2, \u03b3} meets some H \u2208\nH, then the dX -distance from the first entry point to the last exit point is\nat most D.\n\u2022 Similar Intersection Patterns 2: If both {\u03b2, \u03b3} meet some H \u2208 H, then\nthe distance from the first entry point of \u03b2 to that of \u03b3 is at most D, and\nsimilarly for the last exit points.\nDefinition 2.7. [Far98] Suppose that X is weakly hyperbolic relative to H. Suppose that any two electric quasigeodesics without backtracking and with the same\nendpoints have similar intersection patterns with H. Then (X, H) is said to satisfy\nbounded penetration and X is said to be strongly hyperbolic relative to H.\nThe next condition ensures that (X, H) is strongly hyperbolic relative to H.\nDefinition 2.8. A collection H of sets in a \u03b4-hyperbolic metric space X is said to\nbe uniformly D-separated if d(Hi , Hj ) \u2265 D for all Hi , Hj \u2208 H; Hi 6= Hj .\nA collection H of uniformly C-quasiconvex sets in a \u03b4-hyperbolic metric space X is\nsaid to be mutually D-cobounded if for all Hi , Hj \u2208 H, \u03c0i (Hj ) has diameter less\nthan D, where \u03c0i denotes a nearest point projection of X onto Hi . A collection is\nmutually cobounded if it is mutually D-cobounded for some D.\nCoboundedness ensures strong relative hyperbolicity.\nLemma 2.9. ([Far98] Proposition 4.6, [Bow97]) Let (X, dX ) be a (Gromov) hyperbolic metric space and H a collection of \u01eb-neighborhoods of uniformly quasiconvex\nmutually cobounded uniformly separated subsets. Then X is strongly hyperbolic\nrelative to the collection H. Furthermore quasigeodesics without backtracking in\n(X, dX ) and (E(X, H), de ) have similar intersection patterns with elements of H.\n\n\f16\n\nMAHAN MJ\n\nApplications of Lemma 2.9 follow.\nLemma 2.10. Let M h be a hyperbolic manifold. Let T and H denote respectively a\ncollection of Margulis tubes and horoballs that are disjoint from one another. Then\ngh is strongly hyperbolic\nthe elements of T \u222a H are mutually co-bounded. Hence M\nrelative to the collection T \u222a H.\nLemma 2.11. Let S h be a hyperbolic surface, with a finite collection of disjoint\nsimple closed geodesics \u03c3i and cusps Hj . Let S denote the collection of lifts \u03c3ei to H2\nfj . Then the elements of S \u222aH are mutually\nand let H denote the collection of lifts H\nfh is strongly hyperbolic relative to the collection S \u222a H.\nco-bounded. Hence S\n\nA closely related theorem was proved by McMullen (Theorem 8.1 of [McM01]).\nLet H be a locally finite collection of horoballs in a convex subset X of Hn (where\nthe intersection of a horoball, which meets \u2202X in a point, with X is called a horoball\nin X).\n\nDefinition 2.12. The \u01eb-neighborhood of a bi-infinite geodesic in Hn will be called\na thickened geodesic.\nTheorem 2.13. [McM01] For K, D \u2265 1, \u01eb \u2265 0 there exists R \u2265 0 such that the\nfollowing holds:\nLet X be a convex subset of Hn and let H denote a uniformly\nD-separated collection\nS\nof horoballs and thickened geodesics. Let Y = X \\ H\u2208H H and \u03b3 : I \u2192 Y be a\n(K, \u01eb)-quasigeodesic in Y . Let \u03b7 be the geodesic in X with the same endpoints as\n\u03b3. Let H(\u03b7) be the union of all the horoballs and thickened geodesics in H meeting\n\u03b7. Then \u03b7 \u222a H(\u03b7) is R\u2212quasiconvex and \u03b3(I) \u2282 BR (\u03b7 \u222a H(\u03b7)). (The hyperbolic\nmetric on Hn is understood.)\n2.2. Electric Geometry for Surfaces. We now specialize to surfaces. Let S be\na hyperbolic surface with diameter bounded above by K. It follows that injectivity\nradius is bounded below by some \u01eb = \u01eb(K). Let \u03c3 be a finite collection of disjoint\nsimple closed geodesics on S. Component(s) of S \\ \u03c3 will be called the amalgamation component(s) of (S, \u03c3). We shall denote an amalgamation components\nby SA . Let (SGel , dGel ) = E(S, SA ) be obtained from S by electrocuting SA 's\nand let the universal cover of (SGel , dGel ) with the lifted pseudometric be denoted\ne\n(Sg\nGel , dGel ). A slightly different path pseudometric may be constructed on S by\ndeclaring that\n1) the length of any path that lies in the interior of an amalgamation component\nis zero\n2) the length of any path that crosses \u03c3 once has length one\n3) the length of any other path is the sum of lengths of pieces of the above two kinds.\nThis pseudometric differs from (Sg\nGel , dGel ) by at most one (due to the initial and\nfinal segments of length half). We shall ignore this difference (cf Lemma 2.23).\nThe fundamental group \u03c01 (S) may be regarded as a graph of groups with vertex\ngroup(s) the subgroup(s) \u03c01 (SA ) corresponding to amalgamation component(s) and\ncyclic edge groups Z corresponding to \u03c3. Then (Sg\nGel , dGel ) is quasi-isometric to\nthe Bass-Serre tree of the splitting.\nContinuous paths in SGel and Sg\nGel will be called electric paths. Continuous\ngeodesics and quasigeodesics in the electric metric will be called electric geodesics\n\n\fCANNON-THURSTON MAPS FOR SURFACE GROUPS\n\n17\n\nand electric quasigeodesics respectively. We specialize Definition 2.2 to the present\ncontext, where it is slightly more restrictive.\nDefinition 2.14. An electric path \u03b3 \u2282 Sg\nGel is said to be an electric K-quasigeodesic\ng\nin (Sg\nGel , dGel ) without backtracking if \u03b3 is a K-quasigeodesic in (SGel , dGel ) and\ng\n\u03b3 does not return to any lift Sf\nA (\u2282 SGel ) of an amalgamation component SA \u2282 S\nafter leaving it.\nWe now specialize the notion of an electro-ambient quasigeodesic to the context\nof surfaces.\nDefinition 2.15. An electric geodesic \u03bbe without backtracking in (Sg\nGel , dGel ) is\ncalled an electro-ambient quasigeodesic if\nf\na) each segment of \u03bbe lying inside a single lift Sf\nA meets the boundary \u2202 SA at most\nf\ntwice and is perpendicular to \u2202 SA whenever they meet. We shall refer to these\nsegments of \u03bbe as amalgamation segments.\nb) If a, b be the points of intersection of two distinct amalgamation segments of \u03bbe\nwith a lift \u03c3\ne of \u03c3, then \u03bbe \u2229 \u03c3\ne is equal to [a, b], the geodesic segment in \u03c3\ne joining\na, b. Such pieces [a, b] shall be referred to as interpolating segments.\nThe underlying path of an electro-ambient quasigeodesic of the electro-ambient\nquasigeodesic in the hyperbolic metric on Se shall be called the electro-ambient\nrepresentative \u03bbq of \u03bbe .\nSee Figure below, where the bold line indicates the electro-ambient quasigeodesic\nand the thin lines the geodesics \u03c3\ne.\n\nFigure:Electro-ambient quasigeodesic\nThe next Lemma justifies the terminology.\nLemma 2.16. (See Lemma 3.7 of [Mj11]) There exists (K, \u01eb) such that each electroambient representative \u03bbq of an electric geodesic in (Sg\nGel , dGel ) is a (K, \u01eb) hyperbolic\nquasigeodesic.\nProof. Let (Sel , del ) denote the surface S with the (collection of) geodesics \u03c3 electrocuted. Note that the electro-ambient quasigeodesics in (Sg\nGel , dGel ) coincide with\nf\nthose in the universal cover (Sel , del ). Hence it suffices to show that electro-ambient\nquasigeodesics in (Sf\nel , del ) are uniform hyperbolic quasigeodesics.\n\n\f18\n\nMAHAN MJ\n\nLet \u03bbh denote the hyperbolic geodesic joining the end-points of \u03bbe . By Lemmas\n2.9 and 2.11, \u03bbh and \u03bbe , and hence \u03bbh and \u03bbq have similar intersection patterns\nwith N\u01eb (e\n\u03c3 ) for some small \u01eb > 0 and any lift \u03c3\ne of (an element of) \u03c3. Also, \u03bbh and\n\u03bbq track each other off the collection N\u01eb (e\n\u03c3 ). Further, each interpolating segment\nof \u03bbq being a hyperbolic geodesic, it follows (from the 'K-fellow-traveler' property\nof hyperbolic geodesics starting and ending near each other, Lemma 1.6) that each\ninterpolating segment of \u03bbq lies within a (K + 2\u01eb) neighborhood of \u03bbh for some\nfixed K > 0. Again, since each segment of \u03bbq that does not meet an electrocuted\ngeodesic that \u03bbh meets is of uniformly bounded length (bounded by C say), we\nhave finally that \u03bbq lies within a (K + C + 2\u01eb) neighborhood of \u03bbh . Finally, since \u03bbq\nis an electro-ambient representative, it does not backtrack. Hence the Lemma. \u0003\n2.3. Electric isometries.\nDefinition 2.17. Let S be any hyperbolic surface and \u03c3 a collection of disjoint\nsimple closed geodesics on S. A diffeomorphism \u03c6 of S will be called a component\npreserving diffeomorphism if it fixes \u03c3 pointwise and preserves each amalgamation component as a set, i.e. \u03c6 sends each amalgamation component of (S, \u03c3) to\nitself.\nLemma 2.18. Let \u03c6 denote a component preserving diffeomorphism of SG . Then\n\u03c6 induces an isometry of (SGel , dGel ).\nProof. In the electrocuted surface (SGel , dGel ), any electric geodesic \u03bbe has length\nequal to the number of times it crosses \u03c3. Any component preserving diffeomorphism \u03c6 preserves the intersection pattern of \u03bbe with amalgamation components.\nHence \u03c6 is an isometry of (SGel , dGel ).\n\u0003\nThe proof of Lemma 2.18 goes through verbatim after lifting to the universal\ne\ng\ncover (Sg\nGel , dGel ). We let \u03c6 denote the lift of \u03c6 to (SGel , dGel ). This gives\nLemma 2.19. Let \u03c6e denote a lift of a component preserving diffeomorphism \u03c6 to\ne\ng\n(Sg\nGel , dGel ). Then \u03c6 induces an isometry of (SGel , dGel ).\n\n2.4. Nearest-point Projections. The next Lemma says nearest point projections\nin a \u03b4-hyperbolic metric space do not increase distances much. This is a standard\nfact (See Lemma 3.1 of [Mit98b] for instance).\nLemma 2.20. Let (Y, dY ) be a \u03b4-hyperbolic metric space and let \u03bc \u2282 Y be a Cquasiconvex subset, e.g. a geodesic segment. Let \u03c0 : Y \u2192 \u03bc map y \u2208 Y to a point\non \u03bc nearest to y. Then dY (\u03c0(x), \u03c0(y)) \u2264 C3 dY (x, y) for all x, y \u2208 Y where C3\ndepends only on \u03b4, C.\nThe next lemma (from [Mit98b]) says that quasi-isometries and nearest-point\nprojections on (Gromov) hyperbolic metric spaces 'almost commute'.\nLemma 2.21. (Lemma 3.5 of [Mit98b]) Suppose (Y1 , d1 ) and (Y2 , d2 ) are \u03b4-hyperbolic.\nLet \u03bc1 be some geodesic segment in Y1 joining a, b and let p be any point of Y1 .\nAlso let q be a point on \u03bc1 such that d1 (p, q) \u2264 d2 (p, x) for all x \u2208 \u03bc1 . Let \u03c6 be a\n(K, \u01eb) - quasiisometric embedding from Y1 to Y2 . Let \u03bc2 be a geodesic segment in\nY2 joining \u03c6(a) to \u03c6(b) . Let r be a point on \u03bc2 such that d2 (\u03c6(p), r) \u2264 d2 (\u03c6(p), x)\nfor x \u2208 \u03bc2 . Then d2 (r, \u03c6(q)) \u2264 C4 for some constant C4 depending only on K, \u01eb\nand \u03b4.\n\n\fCANNON-THURSTON MAPS FOR SURFACE GROUPS\n\n19\n\nfa to f\nWe shall need the above Lemma for quasi-isometries from S\nSb for two different biLipschitz metrics on the same surface. We shall also need it for electrocuted\nsurfaces.\nAnother property that we shall require for nearest point projections is that nearest point projections in the hyperbolic metric on Se and that in the electric metric\n(Sg\nGel , dGel ) almost agree. To make this precise we make the following definition.\nThe hyperbolic metric on S as well as Se will be denoted by d.\n\ne d) and let \u03bcq be an electro-ambient representative\nDefinition 2.22. Let y \u2208 (S,\nof an electric geodesic \u03bcGel in (Sg\nGel , dGel ). Then \u03c0e (y) = z \u2208 \u03bcq if the ordered\npair {dGel (y, \u03c0e (y)), d(y, \u03c0e (y))} is minimized at z in the lexicographical order on\n(R+ \u222a {0}) \u00d7 (R+ \u222a {0}).\nThe proof of the following Lemma shows that this gives us a definition of \u03c0e\nwhich is ambiguous up to a finite amount of discrepancy not only in the electric\nmetric but also in the hyperbolic metric.\nLemma 2.23. Fix a hyperbolic surface S. For all \u01eb > 0, there exists C > 0\nsuch that if \u03c3 is a finite collection of disjoint simple closed geodesics such that\nd(\u03c3i , \u03c3j ) \u2265 \u01eb for all \u03c3i 6= \u03c3j \u2208 \u03c3, then the following holds.\ne d) joining u, v \u2208 S.\ne Let (SGel , dGel ) be the\nLet \u03bc be a hyperbolic geodesic in (S,\nelectric space obtained from S by electrocuting the amalgamation components of\n(S, \u03c3). Let \u03bcGel be an electric geodesic in (Sg\nGel , dGel ) joining u, v and let \u03bcq be its\ne d)\nelectro-ambient representative. Let \u03c0h denote the nearest point projection of (S,\nonto \u03bc. Then d(\u03c0h (y), \u03c0e (y)) \u2264 C.\nProof. Let [u, v] and [u, v]q denote respectively the hyperbolic geodesic and the\ne Since [u, v]q is a hyperbolic quasielectro-ambient quasigeodesic joining u, v \u2208 S.\ne d) onto [u, v] and\ngeodesic by Lemma 2.16, the nearest point projection of y \u2208 (S,\n[u, v]q almost agree in the hyperbolic metric d. Thus, abusing notation slightly let\ne d) onto [u, v]q . Hence it suffices to show\n\u03c0h denote nearest point projection of (S,\ne\nthat for any y \u2208 S, its hyperbolic and electric projections \u03c0h (y), \u03c0e (y) onto [u, v]q\nalmost agree. See figure below, where we denote \u03c0h (y), \u03c0e (y) by p, q respectively.\n\nFigure:Electric and hyperbolic projections.\n\n\f20\n\nMAHAN MJ\n\nFirst note that any hyperbolic geodesic \u03b7 in Se is also an electric geodesic in\ng\n(Sg\nGel , dGel ). This follows from the fact that (SGel , dGel ) maps to the Bass-Serre\ntree T of the splitting of S along \u03c3, such that the pre-image of every vertex is a\nset of diameter zero in the pseudometric dGel . If a path in (Sg\nGel , dGel ) projects to\na path in T that is not a geodesic, then it must backtrack. Hence, it must leave\nan amalgamating component and return to it. Such a path can clearly not be a\nhyperbolic geodesic in (Sg\nGel , dGel ) since each amalgamating component is convex.\nNext, it follows that hyperbolic projections automatically minimize electric distances. Else as in the preceding paragraph, [y, \u03c0h (y)] would have to cut a lift f\n\u03c31 of\n\u03c3 that separates [u, v]q . Further, [y, \u03c0h (y)] cannot return to \u03c3\nf1 after leaving it. Let\nz be the first point at which [y, \u03c0h (y)] meets \u03c3\nf1 (the intersection point of the dotted\nline with \u03c3\nf1 in the figure above). Also let w be the point on [u, v]q \u2229 \u03c3\nf1 that is nearest to z. Since amalgamation segments of [u, v]q meeting \u03c3\nf1 are perpendicular to\nthe latter, it follows that d(w, z) < d(w, \u03c0h (y)) and therefore d(y, z) < d(y, \u03c0h (y))\ncontradicting the definition of \u03c0h (y). Hence hyperbolic projections automatically\nminimize electric distances.\nFurther, it follows by repeating the argument in the first paragraph that [y, \u03c0h (y)]\nand [y, \u03c0e (y)] pass through the same set of amalgamation components in the same\norder; in particular they cut across the same set of lifts of \u03c3\ne. Let \u03c3\nf2 be the last\nsuch lift. Then \u03c3\nf2 forms the boundary of an amalgamation component Sf\nA whose\nintersection with [u, v]q is of the form [a, b] \u222a [b, c] \u222a [c, d], where [a, b] \u2282 f\n\u03c33 and\n[c, d] \u2282 \u03c3\nf4 are subsegments of two lifts of \u03c3 and [b, c] is perpendicular to these two.\nThen the nearest-point projection of \u03c3\nf2 onto each of [a, b], [b, c], [c, d] has uniformly\nbounded diameter. Hence the nearest point projection of \u03c3\nf2 onto the hyperbolic\ngeodesic [a, d] \u2282 Sf\n\u0003\nA has uniformly bounded diameter. The result follows.\n3. The Minsky Model\nIn this section we summarize the notions and facts from [Min10], [BCM12] and\n[MM00] that we shall need. Let C(S) and P(S) denote respectively the curve\ncomplex and pants complex of a compact surface S, possibly with boundary, with\nthe usual modifications for surfaces of small complexity (see [MM00] for details).\nSplit level Surfaces\nFor our purposes, a pants decomposition of S will be\nSa disjoint collection of 3-holed\nspheres P1 , * * * , Pn embedded in S such that S \\ i Pi is a disjoint collection of\nnon-peripheral annuli in S, no two of which are homotopic. We shall conflate a\npants decomposition of S with the collection of (isotopy classes of) non-peripheral\nboundary curves of P1 , * * * , Pn . Thus when we refer to a pair of pants in a pants\ndecomposition P1 , * * * , Pn of S we are referring to one of the Pi 's, and when we\nrefer to a curve in a pants decomposition of S we are referring to one of the nonperipheral boundary curves of one of the Pi 's.\nLet N be the convex core of a simply or doubly degenerate hyperbolic 3-manifold\nminus an open neighborhood of the cusp(s).\nN is homeomorphic to S \u00d7 [0, \u221e) or S \u00d7 R according as N is simply or doubly\ndegenerate, where S is a compact surface, possibly with boundary.\nLet \u03b8, \u03c9 be positive real numbers. A neighborhood N\u01eb (\u03b3) of a closed geodesic\n\u03b3(\u2282 N ) is called a (\u03b8, \u03c9)-thin tube if the length of \u03b3 is less than \u03b8 and the length\nof the shortest geodesic on \u2202N\u01eb (\u03b3) is greater than \u03c9.\n\n\fCANNON-THURSTON MAPS FOR SURFACE GROUPS\n\n21\n\nLet T denote a collection of disjoint, uniformly separated (\u03b8, \u03c9)-thin tubes in N\nsuch that all Margulis tubes in N belong to T ; in particular \u03b8 is greater than the\nMargulis constant. Let MSbe a 3-manifold biLipschitz homeomorphic to N and let\nM (0) be the image of N \\ T \u2208T Int(T ) in M under the biLipschitz homeomorphism\nF . Let \u2202M (0) (resp. \u2202M ) denote the boundary of M (0) (resp. M ).\nLet (Q, \u2202Q) be the unique hyperbolic pair of pants such that each component of\n\u2202Q has length one. Q will be called the standard pair of pants. An isometrically\nembedded copy of (Q, \u2202Q) in (M (0), \u2202M (0)) will be said to be flat.\nDefinition 3.1. A split level surface associated to a pants decomposition {Q1 , * * * , Qn }\nof S in M (0) \u2282 M is an embedding f : \u222ai (Qi , \u2202Qi ) \u2192 (M (0), \u2202M (0)) such that\n1) Each f (Qi , \u2202Qi ) is flat\n2) f extends to an embedding (also denoted\nf ) of S into M such\nS that the interior\nS\nof each annulus component of f (S \\ i Qi ) lies entirely in F ( T \u2208T Int(T )).\nThe class of all topological embeddings from S to M that agree with a split level\nsurface f associated to a pants decomposition {Q1 , * * * , Qn } on Q1 \u222a * * * \u222a Qn will\nbe denoted by [f ].\nWe define a partial order \u2264E on the collection of split level surfaces in an end E\nof M as follows:\nf1 \u2264E f2 if there exist gi \u2208 [fi ], i = 1, 2, such that g2 (S) lies in the unbounded\ncomponent of E \\ g1 (S).\nTight geodesics\nThe complexity of a compact surface S = Sg,b of genus g and b boundary components\nis defined to be \u03be(Sg,b ) = 3g + b.\nFor any simplex \u03b1 \u2208 C(Y ), \u03b3\u03b1 will denote a collection of disjoint simple closed\ncurves on S representing the (homotopy classes) of vertices of \u03b1. A pair of simplices\n\u03b1, \u03b2 in C(Y ) are said to fill an essential subsurface Y of S if all non-trivial nonperipheral curves in Y have essential intersection with at least one of \u03b3\u03b1 or \u03b3\u03b2 ,\nwhere we assume that representatives \u03b3\u03b1 and \u03b3\u03b2 have been chosen to intersect each\nother minimally.\nGiven arbitrary simplices \u03b1, \u03b2 in C(S), form a regular neighborhood of \u03b3\u03b1 \u222a \u03b3\u03b2 ,\nand fill in all disks and one-holed disks to obtain Y which is said to be filled by\n\u03b1, \u03b2.\nFor a subsurface X \u2286 Z let \u2202Z (X) denote the relative boundary of X in Z, i.e.\nthose boundary components of X that are non-peripheral in Z.\nDefinition 3.2. Let Y be an essential subsurface in S. If \u03be(Y ) > 4, a sequence\nof simplices {vi }i\u2208I \u2282 C(Y ) (where I is a finite or infinite interval in Z) is called\ntight if\n1) For any vertices wi of vi and wj of vj where i 6= j, dC1 (Y ) (wi , wj ) = |i \u2212 j|,\n2) Whenever {i\u22121, i, i+1} \u2282 I, vi represents the relative boundary \u2202Y F (vi\u22121 , vi+1 ).\nIf \u03be(Y ) = 4 then a tight sequence is the vertex sequence of a geodesic in C(Y ).\nA tight geodesic g in C(Y ) consists of a tight sequence v0 , * * * , vn , and two simplices\nin C(Y ), I = I(g) and T = T(g), called its initial and terminal markings such that\nv0 (resp. vn ) is a sub-simplex of I (resp. T). The length of g is n. vi is called a\nsimplex of g. Y is called the domain or support of g and is denoted as Y = D(g).\ng is said to be supported in D(g).\nWe denote the obvious linear order in g as vi < vj whenever i < j.\n\n\f22\n\nMAHAN MJ\n\nA geodesic supported in Y with \u03be(Y ) = 4 is called a 4-geodesic.\nGiven a surface W with \u03be(W ) \u2265 4 and a simplex v in C(W ) we say that Y is a\ncomponent domain of (W, v) if Y is a component of W \\ collar(v), where collar(v)\ndenotes a thin collar neighborhood of the simple closed curves.\nIf g is a tight geodesic with domain D(g), we call Y \u2282 S a component domain\nof g if for some simplex vj of g, Y is a component domain of (D(g), vj ).\nHierarchies\nThe next definition is based on [MM00], describing certain special paths in P(S)\nand component domains associated to them. Paths in P(S) will be maps h from\nintervals I in Z into P(S) such that h(i), h(i + 1) are adjacent vertices of P(S) for\nall i, i + 1 \u2208 I. We reverse the logic of the exposition in [MM00] slightly here by\ndefining a hierarchy path in P(S) first and then associating a hierarchy of tight\ngeodesics to it.\nDefinition 3.3. A hierarchy path in P(S) joining pants decompositions P1 and\nP2 is a path \u03c1 : [0, n] \u2192 P (S) joining \u03c1(0) = P1 to \u03c1(n) = P2 such that\n1) There is a collection {Y } of essential, non-annular subsurfaces of S, called component domains for \u03c1, such that for each component domain Y there is a connected\ninterval JY \u2282 [0, n] with \u2202Y \u2282 \u03c1(j) for each j \u2208 JY .\n2) For a component domain Y , there exists a tight geodesic gY supported in Y such\nthat for each j \u2208 JY , there is an \u03b1 \u2208 gY with \u03b1 \u2208 \u03c1(j).\nA hierarchy path in P(S) is a sequence {Pn }n of pants decompositions of S such\nthat for any Pi , Pj \u2208 {Pn }n , i \u2264 j, the finite sequence Pi , Pi+1 , * * * , Pj\u22121 , Pj is a\nhierarchy path joining pants decompositions Pi and Pj .\nThe collection H of tight geodesics gY supported in component domains Y of \u03c1 will\nbe called the hierarchy of tight geodesics associated to \u03c1.\nThe notion of hierarchy in Definition 3.3 above is a special case of 'hierarchies\nwithout annuli' described in [MM00]. The next definition allows us to associate the\nextra piece of data coming from tight geodesics supported in component domains\nof a hierarchy path \u03c1 to the hierarchy path \u03c1.\nDefinition 3.4. A slice of a hierarchy H associated to a hierarchy path \u03c1 is a\nset \u03c4 of pairs (h, v), where h \u2208 H and v is a simplex of h, satisfying the following\nproperties:\n(1) A geodesic h appears in at most one pair in \u03c4 .\n(2) There is a distinguished pair (h\u03c4 , v\u03c4 ) in \u03c4 , called the bottom pair of \u03c4 . We\ncall h\u03c4 the bottom geodesic.\n(3) For every (k, w) \u2208 \u03c4 other than the bottom pair, D(k) is a component\ndomain of (D(h), v) for some (h, v) \u2208 \u03c4 .\nA resolution of a hierarchy H associated to a hierarchy path \u03c1 : I \u2192 P(S) is\na sequence of slices \u03c4i = {(hi1 , vi1 ), (hi2 , vi2 ), * * * , (hini , vini )} (for i \u2208 I, the same\nindexing set) such that the set of vertices of the simplices {vi1 , vi2 , * * * , vini } is\nthe same as the set of the non-peripheral boundary curves of the pairs of pants in\n\u03c1(i) \u2208 P(S).\nMinsky Blocks (Section 8.1 of [Min10])\nA tight geodesic in H supported in a component domain of complexity 4 is called\na 4-geodesic and an edge of a 4-geodesic in H is called a 4-edge.\n\n\fCANNON-THURSTON MAPS FOR SURFACE GROUPS\n\n23\n\nGiven a 4-edge e in H, let g be the 4-geodesic containing it, and let D(e) be\nthe domain D(g). Let e\u2212 and e+ denote the initial and terminal vertices of e. As\nusual, let collar v denote a small collar neighborhood of v in D(e).\nTo each e a Minsky block B(e) is assigned as as follows:\nB(e) = (D(e) \u00d7 [\u22121, 1]) \\ ( collar (e\u2212 ) \u00d7 [\u22121, \u22121/2)\u222a collar (e+ ) \u00d7 (1/2, 1]).\nThat is, B(e) is the product D(e) \u00d7 [\u22121, 1], with solid-torus trenches dug out of its\ntop and bottom boundaries, corresponding to the two vertices e\u2212 and e+ of e.\nThe gluing boundary of B(e) is\n\u2202\u00b1 B(e) \u2261 (D(e) \\ collar(e\u00b1 )) \u00d7 {\u00b11}.\nThe gluing boundary is a union of three-holed spheres. The rest of the boundary\nis a union of annuli. The top (resp. bottom) gluing boundaries of B(e) are (D(e) \\\ncollar(e+ )) \u00d7 {1} (resp. (D(e) \\ collar(e\u2212 )) \u00d7 {\u22121}.\nThe Model and the bi-Lipschitz Model Theorem\nThe following Theorem summarizes and paraphrases what we need in this paper\nfrom the bi-Lipschitz Model Theorem of Minsky [Min10] and Brock-Canary-Minsky\n[BCM12]. (See Theorem 8.1 of [Min10] in particular.)\nTheorem 3.5. [Min10] [BCM12] Let N be the convex core of a simply or doubly\ndegenerate hyperbolic 3-manifold minus an open neighborhood of the cusp(s). Let\nS be a compact surface, possibly with boundary, such that N is homeomorphic to\nS \u00d7 [0, \u221e) or S \u00d7 R according as N is simply or doubly degenerate. There exist\nL \u2265 1, \u03b8, \u03c9, \u01eb, \u01eb1 > 0, a collection T of (\u03b8, \u03c9)-thin tubes containing all Margulis\ntubes in N , a 3-manifold M , and an L-biLipschitz homeomorphism F : N \u2192 M\nsuch that the following\nS holds.\nLet M (0) = F (N \\ T \u2208T Int(T )) and let F (T ) denote the image of the collection\nT under F . Let \u2264E denote the partial order on the collection of split level surfaces\nin an end E of M . Then there exists a sequence Si of split level surfaces associated\nto pants decompositions Pi exiting E such that\n(1) Si \u2264E Sj if i \u2264 j.\n(2) The sequence {Pi } is a hierarchy path in P(S).\n(3) If Pi \u2229 Pj = {Q1 , * * * Ql } then fi (Qk ) = fj (Qk ) for k = 1 * * * l, where fi , fj\nare the embeddings defining the split level surfaces Si , Sj respectively.\n(4) For all i, Pi \u2229 Pi+1 = {Qi,1 , * * * Qi,l } consists of a collection of l pairs of\npants, such that S \\ (Qi,1 \u222a * * * \u222a Qi,l ) has a single non-annular component\nof complexity 4. Further, there exists a Minsky block Wi and an isometric\nmap Gi of Wi into M (0) such that fi (S \\ (Qi,1 \u222a * * * \u222a Qi,l ) (resp. fi+1 (S \\\n(Qi,1 \u222a * * * \u222a Qi,l )) is contained in the bottom (resp. top) gluing boundary\nof Wi .\n(5) For each flat pair of pants Q in a split level surface Si there exists an isometric embedding of Q\u00d7[\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb] into M (0) such that the embedding restricted\nto Q \u00d7 {0} agrees with fi restricted to Q.\n(6) For each T \u2208 T , there exists a split level surface Si associated to pants decompositions Pi such that the core curve of T is isotopic to a non-peripheral\nboundary curve of Pi . The boundary F (\u2202T ) of F (T ) with the induced metric dT from M (0) is a Euclidean torus equipped with a product structure\nS 1 \u00d7 Sv1 , where any circle of the form S 1 \u00d7 {t} \u2282 S 1 \u00d7 Sv1 is a round circle\nof unit length and is called a horizontal circle; and any circle of the form\n{t} \u00d7 Sv1 is a round circle of length lv and is called a vertical circle.\n\n\f24\n\nMAHAN MJ\n\n(7) Let g be a tight geodesic other than the bottom geodesic in the hierarchy H\nassociated to the hierarchy path {Pi }, let D(g) be the support of g and let\nv be a boundary curve of D(g). Let Tv be the tube in T such that the core\ncurve of Tv is isotopic to v. If a vertical circle of (F (\u2202Tv ), dTv ) has length\nlv less than n\u01eb1 , then the length of g is less than n.\nSince the above statement is culled out of a large amount of material, particularly\nfrom [Min10], we give specific references here.\nM (0) (resp. M ) above is denoted by M\u03bd (0) (resp. M\u03bd ) in Section 8 of [Min10].\nThe collection F (T ) is denoted by U in [Min10] and is called the set of tubes in\nM\u03bd .\nThe hierarchy H in Item (7) of Theorem 3.5 is constructed in Lemma 5.13 of [Min10]\n(see also Theorem 4.6 of [MM00]) and the hierarchy path of Item (2) is obtained\nfrom it by constructing a resolution sweeping through it in Lemma 5.8 of [Min10].\n(We have thus reversed the logical order of hierarchies and hierarchy paths in our\ntreatment.)\nThe estimate on the length of g in Item (7) of Theorem 3.5 comes from Equation\n9.6 of [Min10] which gives estimates on meridian coefficients.\nThe Euclidean structure of F (T ) for T \u2208 T in Item (6) comes from gluing together\nthe internal blocks (as well as boundary blocks) described in Section 8.1 and in\nTheorem 8.1 of [Min10].\nTheorem 8.1 of [Min10] further describes the construction of split level surfaces and\nItems (1), (3) and (4) follow from it.\nItem (5) simply ensures the existence of uniform product neighborhoods and follows\nfrom the fact that Minsky blocks are glued by isometries on their 3-holed sphere\nboundary components. In fact \u01eb = 14 suffices.\nFinally [BCM12] ensures that the model constructed in [Min10] is indeed biLipschitz\nhomeomorphic to N .\nWe use the notation of Theorem 3.5 in the rest of this subsection, fixing N, M .\nLemma 3.6. Given l > 0 there exists n \u2208 N such that the following holds.\nLet v be a vertex in the hierarchy H such that the length of the core curve of the\nMargulis tube Tv corresponding to v is greater than l. Next suppose (h, v) \u2208 \u03c4i\nfor some slice \u03c4i of the hierarchy H such that h is supported on Y , and D is a\ncomponent of Y \\ collar v. Also suppose that h1 \u2208 H such that D is the support of\nh1 . Then the length of h1 is at most n.\nProof. Let \u03b1 be a meridian curve on F (\u2202Tv ) such that F \u22121 (\u03b1) bounds a totally\ngeodesic disk in Tv .\nBy Item (6) of Theorem 3.5, F (\u2202Tv ) is a metric product S 1 \u00d7 Sv1 . Choose\nhorizontal and vertical curves \u03b1h , \u03b1v on F (\u2202Tv ). Then \u03b1 is homologous to (n\u03b1h +\n\u03b1v ) for some integer n. Hence l(\u03b1) \u2265 lv , where l(\u03b1) is the length of \u03b1 and lv denotes\nthe length of the vertical circle. Since F is an L-biLipschitz homeomorphism by\nTheorem 3.5, it follows that l(F \u22121 (\u03b1)) \u2265 lLv . Let \u2206 be the totally geodesic disk\nbounded by F \u22121 (\u03b1). Then the radius rv of \u2206 is bounded below by sinh\u22121 ( lLv ).\nLet lc denote the length of the core curve cv of Tv . Then any geodesic on \u2202Tv\nhomotopic to cv in Tv has length bounded below by lLv lc .\nAlso l(F \u22121 (\u03b1h )) \u2264 L and F \u22121 (\u03b1h ) is homotopic to the core curve cv .\n2\n2\nHence lLv lc \u2264 L. It follows that lv \u2264 Llc \u2264 Ll . The Lemma now follows from\nItem (7) of Theorem 3.5.\n\u0003\n\n\fCANNON-THURSTON MAPS FOR SURFACE GROUPS\n\n25\n\nOne last fallout of the Minsky model (Theorem 8.1 of [Min10] again) that we\nshall need is the following.\nLemma 3.7. Given l > 0 and n \u2208 N, there exists L2 \u2265 1 such that the following\nholds:\nLet Si , Sj (i < j) be split level surfaces associated to pants decompositions Pi , Pj\nsuch that\na) (j \u2212 i) \u2264 n\nb) Pi \u2229 Pj is a (possibly empty) pants decomposition of S \\ W , where W is an\nessential (possibly disconnected) subsurface of S such that each component Wk of\nW has complexity \u03be(Wk ) \u2265 4.\nc)For any k with i < k < j, and (gD , v) \u2208 \u03c4k for D \u2282 Wi for some i, no curve in\nv has a geodesic realization in N of length less than l.\nThen there exists an L2 -biLipschitz embedding G : W \u00d7 [\u22121, 1] \u2192 M , such that\n1) W admits a hyperbolic metric given by W = Q1 \u222a * * * \u222a Qm where each Qi is a\nflat pair of pants.\n2) W \u00d7 [\u22121, 1] is given the product metric.\n3) fi (Pi \\ Pi \u2229 Pj ) \u2282 W \u00d7 {\u22121} and fj (Pj \\ Pi \u2229 Pi ) \u2282 W \u00d7 {1}.\nIdea of Proof: What the Lemma above says is that if a 'thick' piece of the\nmanifold N is trapped between split level surfaces Si , Sj , then it is biLipschitz to\na product region on the support of the hierarchy path between Si , Sj . This follows\nfrom the construction of the model in Section 8.2 of [Min10] along with Equation\n9.6 of [Min10]. The lower bound on lengths of hierarchy curves in hypothesis (c)\nensures an upper bound on the twist coefficient ([hv ] in Equation 9.6 of [Min10])\nexactly as in the proof of Lemma 3.6. Hence the 'full hierarchy' path (including\nannuli in the sense of [MM00]) between Si , Sj equipped with markings is of length\nbounded in terms of l, n. This guarantees the existence of a biLipschitz product\nregion as required. Since this is the only place where we shall require full hierarchies\nand twist coefficients in this paper, and since the rest of the proof of Lemma 3.7\nfollows Lemma 3.6, we omit the details, referring the interested reader to Section\n8.2 of [Min10]. (See also [MM00] where a quasi-isometry is constructed between\nthe mapping class group and the full marking complex. Interpreted in these latter\nterms there is a bounded length element in the mapping class group M CG(W )\ntaking the marking on Si \u2229 W to the marking on Sj \u2229 W .) \u2737\n4. Split Geometry\n4.1. Constructing Split Level Surfaces. The aim of this subsection is to extract\na special sequence of split level surfaces from the sequence of split level surfaces\nconstructed in Theorem 3.5. The main point is to ensure that successive split level\nsurfaces are separated by a definite amount in M (0). We continue with the notation\nof Theorem 3.5 in this subsection.\nFix an l > 0. The precise value of l will be less than the Margulis constant for\nhyperbolic 3-manifolds and will be determined by the Drilling Theorem 4.21 to be\nused in the next subsection. We shall henceforth refer to Margulis tubes that have\ncore curve of length \u2264 l as thin Margulis tubes and the corresponding vertex v\nas a thin vertex.\nFor convenience start with a doubly degenerate surface group. Let \u03c1(i) = {Pi }\nbe a hierarchy path provided by Item (2) of Theorem 3.5. Let H be the hierarchy\n\n\f26\n\nMAHAN MJ\n\nof tight geodesics associated to {Pi } and * * * , \u03c4i\u22121 , \u03c4i , \u03c4i+1 , * * * be a resolution. Let\nSi be the split level surface corresponding to Pi and let \u03c4i be the slice whose\nvertices comprise the curves in Pi . Let Sis denote the collection of flat pairs of\npants occurring in the image of Si in M (0). The metric on the model manifold\nand the induced path metric on M (0) will be denoted by dM and will be called the\nmodel metric. Thus Si is an embedding and Sis is the image in M (0) of a collection\nof pairs of pants.\nDefinition 4.1. A curve v in H is l-thin if the core curve of the Margulis tube Tv\nhas length less than or equal to l.\nA curve v is said to split a pair of split level surfaces Si and Sj (i < j) if v occurs\nas a vertex in both \u03c4i and \u03c4j\u22121 .\nA pair of split level surfaces Si and Sj (i < j) is said to be an l-thin pair if there\nexists an l-thin curve v such that v occurs as a vertex in both \u03c4i and \u03c4j\u22121 .\nA pair of split level surfaces Si and Sj (i < j) is said to be an l-thin pair on a\ncomponent domain D if\na) Pi \u2229 Pj is a pants decomposition of S \\ D, none of whose curves are l-thin.\nb) There exists a tight geodesic gD \u2208 H supported on D such that (gD , u) \u2208 \u03c4k for\nall i < k < j, where the multicurve u contains an l-thin curve. (Here D could be S\nitself.) Further we demand that the initial and final vertices of gD consist of curves\ncontained in (the boundary curves of ) Pi , Pj respectively.\nA pair of split level surfaces Si and Sj (i < j) is said to be an l-thick pair (or\nan l-thick pair on S) if no curve v \u2208 \u03c4k is l-thin for i < k < j.\nIn fact in criterion (b) of the definition of an l-thin pair on a component domain\nD, we might as well have assumed that the initial and final markings of gD , I(gD )\nand T(gD ) respectively, are precisely Pi , Pj . This is the case when the markings\nare complete in the sense of [Min10].\nBy Definition 3.3, Item (1), the set J(v) = {i : v \u2208 \u03c1(i)} is an interval. Consider\nthe family of intervals {J(v) : v \u2208 gH }, where gS\nH is the distinguished main geodesic\n(bottom geodesic) for the hierarchy H. Then v {J(v) : v \u2208 gH } = Z. This follows\nfrom\nthe fact that each \u03c4i has a simple closed curve corresponding to some vertex in\ngH .\nAny pair vi , vi+1 of simplices (multicurves) which form successive vertices of the\nbase geodesic gH are at a distance of 1 from each other by tightness of gH .\nSelecting Split Level Surfaces\nWe shall now construct a subset I of Z by selecting a subsequence of the elements\n{Pi } of the hierarchy path. Let \u03c4mi be the first slice in the resolution such that\n(gH , vi ) \u2208 \u03c4mi . Let I1 = {mi : i \u2208 Z}. We shall now expand the set I1 if necessary\nas follows.\nIf some curve in vi is l-thin, then we declare that [mi , mi+1 ] \u2229 I = {mi , mi+1 },\ni.e. no integer strictly between mi , mi+1 is added to I1 .\nMore generally, for any j \u2208 Z \\ I1 , choose i such that mi < j < mi+1 .\nThen j \u2208 I2 if and only if there exists k\na) either with j < k \u2264 mi+1 such that Sj , Sk form an l-thin pair on some component\ndomain D.\nb) or with k < j \u2264 mi+1 such that Sk , Sj form an l-thin pair on some component\ndomain D.\n\n\fCANNON-THURSTON MAPS FOR SURFACE GROUPS\n\n27\n\nFinally set I = I1 \u222a I2 . Then I = {* * * , ni\u22121 , ni , ni+1 , * * * } inherits a linear order\nfrom Z such that j < k implies nj < nk .\nNote that the same construction works for simply degenerate groups if we replace\nZ by N.\nThe next few Propositions identify some of the features of the selection I. The\nmain point is to show that the sequence of split level surfaces Sni makes definite\nprogress out an end.\nProposition 4.2. Let I = {* * * , ni\u22121 , ni , ni+1 , * * * } be as above. There exists a\npositive integer N0 such that for all i,\na) either (Sni , Sni+1 ) is an l-thin pair on some component domain D\nb) or (Sni , Sni+1 ) is an l-thick pair and ni+1 \u2212 ni \u2264 N0 .\nProof. Suppose that (Sni , Sni+1 ) is not an l-thin pair on some component domain.\nThen, by the construction of I and Lemma 3.6, there exists N1 (= N1 (l)) such\nthat for all k with ni < k < ni+1 , if \u03c4k = {(hk1 , vk1 ), (hk2 , vk2 ), * * * , (hkmk , vkmk )},\nthe length of the tight geodesic hki satisfies l(hki ) \u2264 N1 . Further, none of the\ncurves in vki are l-thin, ensuring l-thickness of the pair (Sni , Sni+1 ).\nNote that mk \u2264 \u03be(S) where \u03be(S) is the complexity of S. Also the number of\ncomponent domains in W \\ collar(v) for W = D(hki ) is certainly bounded above\nby the number of pairs of pants in a pants decomposition of S and hence by \u03be(S).\n\u03be(S)\n\u03be(S)\nTherefore (ni+1 \u2212ni ) is bounded above by N1 \u00d7* * *\u00d7N1\n(\u03be(S) times). Choosing\n\u03be(S)2\n\nN0 = N1\n\nwe are done.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe next Proposition asserts that between two successive split level surfaces Smi\nand Smi+1 selected from the base geodesic, our selection process 'interpolates' a\nuniformly bounded number of new split level surfaces. Equivalently the cardinality\nof the set (I2 \u2229 [mi , mi+1 ]) is uniformly bounded.\nProposition 4.3. Let I = {* * * , ni\u22121 , ni , ni+1 , * * * } and I1 = {* * * , mi\u22121 , mi , mi+1 , * * * }\nbe as above. There exist a positive integer N2 such that for all i, if nj = mi and\nnk = mi+1 then k \u2212 j \u2264 N2 .\nProof. Let k \u2208 I. So Sk is a split level surface interpolated between Smi and Smi+1\nfor some k with mi < k < mi+1 . Let the corresponding slice \u03c4k = {(hk1 , vk1 ), (hk2 , vk2 ), * * * , (hkmk , vkmk )}.\nThen there exists a unique 'subslice' \u03c4k0 = {(hk1 , vk1 ), (hk2 , vk2 ), * * * , (hkrk , vkrk )},\nwith rk \u2264 mk such that the length of the tight geodesic hki satisfies l(hki ) \u2264 N1\nfor all i \u2264 rk and Sk is a split level surface.\nSince the total number of such choices is bounded above by N0 by the proof of\nProposition 4.2, and for each such choice at most two (by the construction of I2\nabove) split level surfaces are introduced, it follows that the total number of l-thin\n\u03be(S)2\n.\nsplit level surfaces Sk with mi < k < mi+1 is bounded above by 2N0 = 2N1\nChoosing N2 = 2N0 we are done.\n\u0003\nLemma 4.4. There exists n such that each thin curve splits at most n split level\nsurfaces in the sequence {Sni : i \u2208 I}.\nProof. Since, for any i the number of split level surfaces Sni between Smi and Smi+1\n(mi , mi+1 \u2208 I1 ) is at most N2 by Proposition 4.3, it suffices to prove that any thin\ncurve splits a uniformly bounded number of Smi 's.\nIf a curve v splits both Smi and Smj , then v belongs to both the pants decomposition Pmi and Pmj \u22121 .\n\n\f28\n\nMAHAN MJ\n\nSuppose (gS , vmk ) \u2208 \u03c4mk for k = i, j, where gS denotes the bottom geodesic of\nthe hierarchy H. Then the distance between vmi and vmj in C(S) is at most 3 by\ntightness, i.e. |i \u2212 j| \u2264 3. Taking n = 3N2 , we are through.\n\u0003\nPushing split level Surfaces Apart\nWe shall now use Item (5) of Theorem 3.5 to 'thicken' each of the Sni 's if necessary,\nso that successive split level surfaces can be arranged to be uniformly separated.\nRecall that Sis is the collection of flat embedded pairs of pants in M (0) corresponding to the split level surface Si .\nDefinition 4.5. A pair of split level surfaces Si and Sj (i < j) is said to be kseparated if\na) for all x \u2208 Sis , d(x, Sjs ) \u2265 k\nb)Similarly, for all x \u2208 Sjs , d(x, Sis ) \u2265 k.\nLemma 4.6. Let I = {* * * , ni\u22121 , ni , ni+1 , * * * } be as above. There exist k0 > 0 and\na sequence of split level surfaces \u03a3i and a positive integer N0 such that for all i,\n(\u03a3i , \u03a3i+1 ) is k0 -separated and\na) either (\u03a3i , \u03a3i+1 ) is an l-thin pair on some component domain D\nb) or (\u03a3i , \u03a3i+1 ) is an l-thick pair and ni+1 \u2212 ni \u2264 N0 .\nProof. By Proposition 4.2, the sequence {Sni }i satisfies one of the alternatives (a)\nor (b). It remains to modify {Sni }i such that (Sni , Sni+1 ) are k0 -separated for some\nk0 > 0 and all i.\nBy Item (5) of Theorem 3.5, there exists \u01eb > 0 such that for all flat pairs of pants\nQi in Sns i there exists an isometric embedding Hi : Qi \u00d7 [\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb] into M (0).\nAlso, by Lemma 4.4, there exists n \u2208 N such that if Qk \u2208 Pni \u2229 Pnj , then\n|i \u2212 j| \u2264 n. Further the collection {i \u2208 I : Qk \u2208 Pni } = IQk is an interval in Z. Let\n\u01eb2 = n\u01eb . If IQk = [ak , bk ] \u2282 Z, define Qks = Hk |Qk \u00d7s\u01eb2 . Note that (bk \u2212 ak ) \u2264 n.\nFor each embedding fni defining the split level surface Sni , and Qk \u2208 Pni \u2229 Pnj\nfor some j 6= i, let IQk = [ak , bk ] and s = (ni \u2212ak ). Then define fn\u2032 i |Qk = Hk |Qk \u00d7s\u01eb2 .\nNow, let \u03a3i be the split level surface defined by fn\u2032 i |Qk , whenever Qk \u2208 Pni .\nChoosing k0 = \u01eb2 , it follows that successive split level surfaces are k0 -separated. \u0003\nLet Tl denote the collection\nS of tubes in T whose core curves have length less than\nl.

An L-biLipschitz split surface in M (l) associated to a pants\ndecomposition {Q1 , * * * , Qn } of S andS\na collection {A1 , * * * , Am } of complementary\nannuli in S is an embedding f : \u222ai Qi \u222ai Ai \u2192 M (l) such that\n1) the restriction f : \u222ai (Qi , \u2202Qi ) \u2192 (M (0), \u2202M (0)) is a split level surface.\n2) the restriction f : Ai \u2192 M (l) is an L-biLipschitz embedding.\n3) f extends to an embedding (also denoted\nS f ) of S into M such thatSthe interior of\neach annulus component of f (S \\ (\u222ai Qi \u222ai Ai )) lies entirely in F ( T \u2208Tl Int(T )).\nNote: The difference between a split level surface and a split surface is that the\nlatter may contain biLipschitz annuli in addition to flat pairs of pants.\nLet \u03a3si denote the union of the collection of flat pairs of pants and biLipschitz\nannuli in the image of the embedding \u03a3i .\nTheorem 4.8.

Similarly,\npairs of split surfaces satisfying Alternative (2) of Theorem 4.8 will be called an\nl-thick pair\n(or simply a thick pair) of split surfaces.\nRemark 4.9. The notion of split surface could be made a bit more general. We\nmight as well require a split surface to be a (uniformly) biLipschitz embedding of\na bounded geometry subsurface of S containing a pants decomposition. Theorem\n4.8 then summarizes the consequences of the Minsky model that we shall need in\nthis paper. We have thus constructed the following from the Minsky model:\n1) A sequence of split surfaces Sis exiting the end(s) of M , where M is marked with\na homeomorphism to S \u00d7 J (J is R or [0, \u221e) according as M is totally or simply\ndegenerate). Sis \u2282 S \u00d7 {i}.\n2) A collection of Margulis tubes T in N with image F (T ) in M (under the biLipschitz homeomorphism between N and M ). We refer to the elements of F (T ) also\nas Margulis tubes.\n3) For each complementary annulus of Sis with core \u03c3, there is a Margulis tube\nT \u2208 T whose core is freely homotopic to \u03c3 such that F (T ) intersects Sis at the\nboundary. (What this roughly means is that there is an F (T ) that contains the\ncomplementary annulus.) We say that F (T ) splits Sis .\n4) There exist constants \u01eb0 > 0, K0 > 1 such that for all i, either there exists a\ns\ns\nMargulis tube splitting both Sis and Si+1\n, or else Si (= Sis ) and Si+1 (= Si+1\n) have\ninjectivity radius bounded below by \u01eb0 and bound a thick block Bi , where a thick\nblock is defined to be a K0 \u2212biLipschitz homeomorphic image of S \u00d7 I.\n5) F (T ) \u2229 Sis is either empty or consists of a pair of boundary components of Sis\nthat are parallel in Si .\n6) There is a uniform upper bound n = n(M ) on the number of surfaces that F (T )\nsplits.\nFor easy reference later on, a model manifold satisfying conditions (1)-(6) above is\nsaid to have weak split geometry.\nWe have isolated the features of weak split geometry in Remark 4.9 above so as\nto emphasize the point that it is possible to make a definition independent of the\nMinsky model and the hierarchy machinery.1 This will be useful for easy referencing\nin [Mj07] and [MS11]. In fact a strengthening of weak split geometry will be enough\nto guarantee the existence of Cannon-Thurston maps as we shall see below.\n4.2. Split Blocks.\nDefinition 4.10. Let (\u03a3si , \u03a3si+1 ) be a thick pair of split surfaces in M . The closure\nof the bounded component of M \\ (\u03a3si \u222a \u03a3si+1 ) will be called a thick block.\n1This was our original approach to the main Theorem of this paper: Prove it for more and\nmore general model geometries, e.g. bounded geometry [Mj10a], i-bounded geometry [Mj11],\namalgamation geometry and split geometry [Mj05]. Finally prove that the Minsky model satisfies\nsplit geometry [Mj06].\n\n\fCANNON-THURSTON MAPS FOR SURFACE GROUPS\n\n31\n\nNote that a thick block is uniformly biLipschitz to the product S \u00d7 [0, 1] and\nthat its boundary components are \u03a3si , \u03a3si+1 .\nDefinition 4.11. Let (\u03a3si , \u03a3si+1 ) be an l-thin pair of split surfaces in M and F (Ti )\ns\ns\nbe the collection of l-thin Margulis tubes that split both \u03a3S\ni , \u03a3i+1 . The closure of the\ns\ns\nunion of the bounded components of M \\ ((\u03a3i \u222a \u03a3i+1 ) T \u2208Ti F (T )) will be called\na split block. Equivalently, the closure of the union of the bounded components of\nM (l) \\ (\u03a3si \u222a \u03a3si+1 ) is a split block.\nTopologically, a split block B s is a topological product S s \u00d7 I for some not\nnecessarily connected S s . However, its upper and lower boundaries need not be\nS s \u00d7 1 and S s \u00d7 0. We only require that the upper and lower boundaries be split\nsubsurfaces of S s . This is to allow for Margulis tubes starting (or ending) within\nthe split block. Such tubes would split one of the horizontal boundaries but not\nboth. We shall call such tubes hanging tubes. Connected components of split\nblocks are called split components. By l-thinness, there is a non-empty collection\nof l-thin Margulis tubes, called splitting tubes, splitting a split block. For each\nsplitting tube F (T ) of a split block B s , the intersection (B s \u2229 F (T )) \u2282 M is called\nthe vertical boundary of the splitting tube. Note that the vertical boundary of\na splitting tube is the union of two disjoint annuli.\nSee figure below, where the left split component has four hanging tubes and\nthe right split component has two hanging tubes. The vertical space between the\ncomponents is the place where an l-thin Margulis tube splits the split block into\ntwo split components.\n\nFigure: Split Components of Split Block with hanging tubes\nObserve further that for each hanging tube F (T ), there exists a split surface\nS s (marked with a dotted line in the figure) which intersects the boundary F (\u2202T )\nnon-trivially and such that S s contains an annulus whose core-curve is homotopic\n(in M ) to the core curve of F (T ). Also, the closure of (F (\u2202T ) \\ S s ) consists of\nprecisely two annuli called the vertical boundary of the hanging tube. We can\nassume further that\na) S s \u2229 F (\u2202T ) is a biLipschitz annulus called the horizontal boundary of F (T )\nin the split block B s .\nb) the union of the vertical and horizontal boundaries of an l\u2212thin hanging tube\nF (T ) in B s is precisely equal to F (T ) \u2229 B s .\nNote that the whole manifold M is the union of\na) Thick blocks (biLipschitz homeomorphic to S \u00d7 I)\nb) Split blocks (homeomorphic to S s \u00d7 I for some split surfaces)\nc) l-thin Margulis tubes.\n\n\f32\n\nMAHAN MJ\n\nAlso note that the union of thick and split blocks is M (l), which is the complement (in M ) of the union of l-thin Margulis tubes. Each of these Margulis tubes\nsplits a uniformly bounded number of split blocks and might end in a hanging tube.\n4.3. Electrocutions. For any hanging tube or splitting tube F (Tj ) in a split block\nB s (with top and bottom split surfaces \u03a3sk , \u03a3sk+1 , say), let Aji = S 1 \u00d7 [0, lji ],\n(i = 1, 2), be the vertical boundaries (i = 1, 2 correspond to the left and right\nvertical annuli in the previous Figure). Let the metric product S 1 \u00d7 [0, 1] be called\nthe standard annulus for splitting tubes. For hanging tubes the standard annulus\nwill be S 1 \u00d7 [0, 1/2].\nWe shall define a welded split block Bwel (homeomorphic to S \u00d7 [0, 1]) to be a\nsplit block with identifications on vertical boundaries of splitting tubes and hanging\n0\ntubes. Let Hji\n: [0, lji ] \u2192 [0, x] be the unique linear surjective map (scaling) taking\n0 to 0 and lji to x, where x is 1 or 1/2 according as F (Tj ) is a splitting tube or a\n0\nhanging tube. Now define Hji : S 1 \u00d7 [0, lji ] \u2192 S 1 \u00d7 [0, x] by Hji (y, z) = (y, Hji\n(z)).\n1\nFinally extend Hj1 \u222a Hj2 continuously to the horizontal boundaries S \u00d7 [\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb]\nof hanging tubes F (Tj ) as Lipschitz maps to S 1 \u00d7 {p} by Hj (y, z) = (y, p) where\np is either 0 or 1/2 according as the horizontal boundary of F (Tj ) lies at the\nbottom or the top of the hanging tube (for instance in the figure, the horizontal\nboundary marked with a dotted line lies at the top of a hanging tube). Now glue\nthe mapping cylinders of Hj1 \u222a Hj2 \u222a Hj (for hanging tubes) and Hj1 \u222a Hj2 (for\nsplitting tubes) to F (\u2202Tj ) \u2229 B s to obtain the welded split block Bwel . Note that\nBwel is homeomorphic to S \u00d7 [0, 1]. The images of the standard annuli in Bwel after\nthe identification shall simply be called standard annuli in Bwel .\nFor each hanging tube, there exists one distinguished curve on either \u03a3sk or\ns\n\u03a3k+1 . When the hanging tube intersects \u03a3sk+1 , this is the image of S 1 \u00d7 {1/2}\ncontained in the standard annulus after identification. Similarly, when the hanging\ntube intersects \u03a3sk , this is the image of S 1 \u00d7 {0} contained in the standard annulus\nafter identification. Again, for each splitting tube, there exists two distinguished\ncurves, one each on \u03a3sk and \u03a3sk+1 - the images of S 1 \u00d7 {0, 1} contained in the\nstandard annulus after identification. Such simple closed curves shall be called\nweld curves. The resulting metric on Bwel will be denoted by dwel .\nWe shall equip Bwel with a new pseudometric. Equip the standard annulus\nS 1 \u00d7 [0, x] (where x is 1 or 1/2) with the product of the zero metric on the S 1 factor and the Euclidean metric on the [0, x] factor. Let (S 1 \u00d7 [0, x], d0 ) denote the\nresulting pseudometric. The tube-electrocuted metric dtel is defined to be the\npseudometric metric that agrees with dwel away from the standard annuli in Bwel\nand with d0 on the standard annuli in Bwel . To distinguish it from (Bwel , dwel ) we\nshall represent the new space and the pseudometric on it by (Btel , dtel ). Note that\nthe underlying topological spaces Bwel and Btel are the same and homeomorphic\nto S \u00d7 [0, 1].\nRecall that in defining thick blocks, S was equipped with a fixed hyperbolic\nmetric. If \u03a3sk is the bottom split surface of the split block Bks and also the top\ns\nsplit surface of a (thick or split) block block Bk\u22121\n, then the common split surface\ns\n\u03a3k can be easily extended over complementary annuli to a common uniformly\nbiLipschitz embedding of S into welded blocks Bwel,k and Bwel,k\u22121 , where we define\nBwel,m = Bm for thick blocks. When Bk\u22121 is thick, this follows from the fact that\nthe complementary annuli are uniformly biLipschitz embeddings of S 1 \u00d7[0, 1]. When\ns\nBk\u22121\nis split, the mapping cylinder construction above restricted to \u03a3sk is the same\n\n\fCANNON-THURSTON MAPS FOR SURFACE GROUPS\n\n33\n\nwhether \u03a3sk is regarded as the bottom split surface of Bks or the top split surface\ns\nof Bk\u22121\n. We shall continue to denote the extended split surface by \u03a3sk and call\nit a split surface in Bwel,k . From now on shall drop the suffix wel from (thick or\nsplit) blocks Bwel,k and denote them simply as Bk . Note that all such extended\nsplit surfaces are homeomorphic to S via uniformly biLipschitz homeomorphisms.\nThe Welded Model Manifold\nGluing successive welded blocks along common split surfaces we obtain the welded\nmodel manifold (Mwel , dwel ) homeomorphic to S \u00d7 J, where J = R or [0, \u221e)\naccording as the original manifold N is doubly or simply degenerate.\nIt remains to construct the tube-electrocuted pseudometric dtel on Mwel . The\ntube electrocuted metrics on successive welded split blocks coincide on the common\nsplit surface. The same is clearly true if the successive blocks are thick.\nIf a weld curve lies in \u03a3sk = Bwel,k \u2229Bwel,k\u22121 and precisely one of Bwel,k , Bwel,k\u22121\nis a thick block, we fix the convention that for the tube electrocuted metric dtel on\nMwel : All weld curves have length zero.\nGluing successive tube electrocuted blocks using the convention above, we obtain the tube electrocuted manifold (Mtel , dtel ). Observe that the underlying\ntopological manifolds Mwel and Mtel are the same. (The notation (Mwel , dwel ) and\n(Mtel , dtel ) is used to distinguish the metrics.)\nThe union of the images of the contiguous mapping cylinders of maps Hj1 \u222a\nHj2 \u222a Hj (or Hj1 \u222a Hj2 ) in (Mtel , dtel ) associated to a particular l-thin Margulis\ntube T (and hence F (T )) is topologically a solid torus T t . Equipped with the\ntube electrocuted metric, (T t , dtel ) is of diameter at most n by Theorem 4.8. The\ncollection of all T t 's in (Mtel , dtel ) is denoted T t . (We shall continue to use the\nsame notation T t for the collection of T t 's in (Mwel , dG ) to be defined below.)\nThe images of split components K of B s in Btel will continue to be called split\ne of a split component K of (Btel , dtel ) to the universal\ncomponents of Btel . A lift K\ng\ng\ncover (Btel , dtel ) shall be termed a split component of B\ntel .\nLet dG be the (pseudo)-metric obtained by electrocuting the collection K of\ne in (B\ng\ng\nsplit components K\ntel , dtel ) \u2282 (Mtel , dtel ) as (Btel , dtel ) ranges over all split\ng\n]\n]\nblocks. dG will be called the the graph metric on M\ntel (= Mwel ). Thus (Mwel , dG )\n]\nis isometric to E(M\nwel , K) with the electric metric.\nRemark 4.12. Alternate Description: There is an alternate description of a\nf which makes it quasi-isometric to (M\n]\npseudometric on M\nwel , dG ). For each lift\ne \u2282 M\nf of a split component K of a split block of M (l) \u2282 M , there are lifts of\nK\ne in M\nf. Adjoining these lifts\nl-thin Margulis tubes that share the boundary of K\n\u2032\ne\nto K we obtain extended split components. Let K denote the collection of\nf.

Here is the raison d'etre for the two closely related but different\nelectric spaces. In the ladder construction of Section 5 below, it is important that\na split surface goes 'all the way across', i.e. is an embedded copy of S. There\nis no canonical way to do this in the model manifold M . In fact for the ladder\nconstruction of Section 5 to work, it is important that a split surface in (Mwel , dwel )\nis an embedded copy of S having uniformly bounded geometry. This is simply not\npossible in M as Margulis tubes may be arbitrarily thin. On the other hand, we\ne by means of the ladder. Since\nfinally need to control hyperbolic geodesics in N\nf. The Alternate\nM is biLipschitz to N , we can equivalently control them in M\n]\nDescription above establishes a way of transferring this control from (M\nwel , dG ) to\nf\nM , which is where we really want the control on geodesics.\nThe following definition illustrates this passing back and forth between these two\nquasi-isometric electric spaces.\ne and X = F (Y ). X \u2282 M\nf is said to be \u2206-graph\nDefinition 4.14.

Quasiconvexity of Split Components. We now proceed to show further\nthat split components are quasiconvex (not necessarily uniformly) in the hyperbolic metric, and uniformly quasiconvex in the graph metric, i.e. we need to show\nhyperbolic quasiconvexity and uniform graph quasiconvexity of split components.\nHyperbolic Quasiconvexity:\nLet N = H3 /\u0393 be a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold. Then [Thu80] there exists\na geometrically finite hyperbolic manifold with compact convex core Ngf and a\nstrictly type-preserving embedding i of Ngf into N , which is a homotopy equivalence. Then for any boundary component S h of Ngf , i\u2217 (\u03c01 (S h )) \u2282 \u03c01 (N ) is called a\nperipheral subgroup. In the Theorem below \u03c01 (N ) will be identified with a Kleinian\ngroup \u0393 and the peripheral subgroup i\u2217 (\u03c01 (S h )) with a Kleinian subgroup of \u0393.\nTheorem 4.15. Covering Theorem [Thu80] [Can96] Let N = H3 /\u0393 be a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold. A finitely generated subgroup \u0393\u2032 is geometrically infinite\nif and only if it contains a finite index subgroup of a geometrically infinite peripheral\nsubgroup.\nWe shall now specialize the Thurston-Canary covering theorem 4.15 to the\ncase under consideration, namely, infinite index free subgroups of surface Kleinian\ngroups.\nLemma 4.16. Let N be a simply or doubly degenerate hyperbolic 3-manifold homotopy equivalent to a surface equipped with a weak split geometry model M . For\n\n\fCANNON-THURSTON MAPS FOR SURFACE GROUPS\n\n35\n\ne . Then there exists C0 = C0 (K) such that\nK a split component, let K\u0303 be a lift to N\ne.\nthe convex hull of K\u0303 minus cusps lies in a C0 -neighborhood of K\u0303 in N\n\nProof. Let \u0393 = \u03c01 (N ), and \u0393\u2032 = i\u2217 (\u03c01 (K))(\u2282 \u0393).\nThen \u0393 itself is the unique peripheral subgroup. Since \u0393\u2032 has infinite index in\n\u0393, it follows from Theorem 4.15 that \u0393\u2032 is geometrically finite. The result follows.\n(Cusps need to be excised because the model manifold is biLipschitz homeomorphic\nto N minus cusps.)\n\u0003\nGraph Quasiconvexity:\nNext, we shall prove that each split component is uniformly graph quasiconvex. We\nbegin with the following Lemma. Recall that we are dealing with simply or totally\ndegenerate groups without accidental parabolics.\nLemma 4.17. Let \u03a3 be a component of a proper extended split subsurface Sis of S.\nAny (non-peripheral) simple closed curve in S appearing in the hierarchy whose free\nhomotopy class has a representative lying in \u03a3 must have a geodesic representative\nin M lying within a uniformly bounded distance of Sis in the graph metric dG .\nProof. Suppose a curve v in the hierarchy is homotopic into \u03a3. Then v is at a\ndistance of at most 1 in the curve complex from each of the boundary components\nof \u03a3. Since \u03a3 is a proper subsurface of S, the relative boundary \u2202S (\u03a3) 6= \u2205. Let\n\u03b1 be such a boundary component. Next, suppose that the geodesic realization of\nv in N intersects some block Bjs (via the correspondence in Alternate Description\n4.12). Then v must be at a distance of at most one from some curve \u03c3 in the base\ngeodesic gH forming an element of the pants decomposition of the split surface Sjs .\nBy tightness, the distance from \u03b1 to \u03c3 in the curve complex is at most 2. Hence\nthe distance (\u2264 |i \u2212 j|) of Sjs from Sis (in the dG metric) is \u2264 2n from Lemma 4.4.\nTherefore v is realized within a distance 2n of Sis in the graph metric dG .\n\u0003\n\nRecall (Definition 8.8.1 of [Thu80]) that a pleated surface in a hyperbolic\nthree-manifold N is a complete hyperbolic surface S of finite area, together with an\nisometric map h : S \u2192 N such that every x \u2208 S is in the interior of some geodesic\nsegment in S which is mapped by h to a geodesic segment in N . Also, h maps\ncusps to cusps. We refer the reader to Section 8.8 of [Thu80] for further details. A\npleated surface is said to be incompressible if h\u2217 : \u03c01 (S) \u2192 \u03c01 (N ) is injective. A\nstandard fact about hyperbolic surfaces and pleated surfaces is Lemma 4.18 below.\n(See the proof of Proposition 8.8.5 of [Thu80] for instance.)\nAn l-thin annulus on a hyperbolic surface S h is a maximal connected component of the set {x \u2208 S h : injradx (S h ) < 2l }. This is the 2-dimensional analogue of\nan l-thin Margulis tube. Note that an l-thin annulus may also be a neighborhood\nof a cusp in S h .\nLemma 4.18. [Thu80] [Bon86] For all l > 0 and g, n \u2208 N there exists \u2206 =\n\u2206(l, g, n) > 0 such that the following holds.\nLet S h be any hyperbolic surface of genus g and n boundary components and/or\ncusps. Let Al be the collection of l-thin annuli. Then E(S h , Al ) has diameter less\nthan \u2206 in the electric metric.\nAgain, let N be a hyperbolic 3-manifold and let Tl be the collection of l-thin Margulis\ntubes and cusps in it. Let h : S \u2192 N be an incompressible pleated surface. Then\nh(S) has diameter less than \u2206 in the electric metric on E(N, Tl ).\n\n\f36\n\nMAHAN MJ\n\nNext, we show that any (non-peripheral) simple closed curve vi in Sis (not just\nhierarchy curves as in Lemma 4.17) must be realized within a uniformly bounded\ndistance of Sis in the graph metric. In fact we shall show further that any pleated\nsurface which contains at least one boundary geodesic of \u03a3 in its pleating locus lies\nwithin a uniformly bounded distance of Sis in the graph metric.\nLemma 4.19. There exists B > 0 such that the following holds:\nLet \u03a3 be a proper split subsurface of Sis . Then any pleated surface with at least one\nboundary component coinciding with a geodesic representative of a non-peripheral\nf, K\u2032 ))/\u0393,\ncomponent of \u2202\u03a3 must lie within a B-neighborhood of Sis in (M, dG ) = (E(M\n\u2032\nf\nwhere K denotes the collection of extended split components in M and \u0393 is the\nf. In\nfundamental group of M regarded as the group of deck transformations of M\nparticular, every simple closed curve in S homotopic into \u03a3 has a geodesic representative within a B-neighborhood of Sis in (M, dG ).\nProof. Choose a curve vi homotopic to a simple closed curve on \u03a3. Let \u03b1 denote\nits geodesic realization in N .\nLet \u03a3p be any pleated (sub)surface whose boundary coincides with the geodesics\nrepresenting the boundary components of \u03a3. (See [Thu80] for the construction\nof such pleated surfaces.) In particular, we may choose \u03a3p such that its pleating\nlocus contains vi . Since Sis is a split surface in M , the topological type of \u03a3p\nhas finitely many possibilities. By Lemma 4.18 the diameter of \u03a3p is bounded by\n\u2206 = \u2206(l) in the electric metric on E(N, Tl ). Since the l-thin components of the\nboundary of \u03a3p are contained in l-thin tubes bounding Sis , it follows that \u03a3p (and\n\u03b1 in particular) lies in a \u2206 neighborhood of Sis in the electric metric on E(N, Tl ).\nSince each T \u2208 Tl is contained in the image of some K \u2208 K\u2032 under the quotient\nf, K\u2032 )) \u2192 (E(M\nf, K\u2032 ))/\u0393 = (M, dG ) the result follows.\nmap (E(M\n\u0003\n\nRemark 4.20. In [Bow05], Bowditch indicates a method to obtain a related (stronger)\nresult that given B1 > 0, there exists B2 > 0 such that any two simple closed curves\nrealized within a Hausdorff distance B1 of each other in M are within a distance\nB2 of each other in the curve complex.\n4.5. Drilling and Filling. In this subsection we summarize some material that\nwill be needed in Section 4.6 to prove uniform graph quasiconvexity of split components.\nThe Drilling Theorem of Brock and Bromberg [BB04], which built on work of\nHodgson and Kerckhoff [HK98] [HK05] is given below. We shall invoke a version of\nthis theorem which is closely related to one used by Brock and Souto in [BS06].\nTheorem 4.21. [BB04] For each L > 1, and n a positive integer, there is an\nl > 0 so that if Ngf is a geometrically finite hyperbolic 3-manifold and c1 , * * * cn are\ngeodesics in Ngf with length lNgf (ci ) < l for all ci , then there is an L-biLipschitz\ndiffeomorphism of pairs\n0\nh : (Ngf \\ \u222ai T(ci ), \u222ai \u2202T(c)) \u2192 (Ngf\n\\ \u222ai P(ci ), \u222ai \u2202P(ci ))\n\nwhere Ngf \\ \u222ai T(ci ) denotes the complement of a standard tubular neighborhood of\n0\ndenotes the complete hyperbolic structure on Ngf \\ \u222ai ci , and P(ci )\n\u222ai ci in Ngf , Ngf\ndenotes a standard rank-2 cusp corresponding to ci .\n0\nNgf\nis said to be obtained from Ngf by drilling. We remark here (following\n[BB04]) that the drilled manifold is the unique hyperbolic manifold which has the\n\n\fCANNON-THURSTON MAPS FOR SURFACE GROUPS\n\n37\n\nsame conformal structure on its domain of discontinuity, but has core curves of T\ndrilled out to give rank 2 parabolics.\nThe Filling Theorem of Thurston [Thu80] (generalized by Canary [Can96]) we\nshall require is stated below.\nTheorem 4.22. [Thu80] [Can96] Given any quasifuchsian surface group \u0393 and\nN = H3 /\u0393 there exists \u03b4 > 0 depending only on the Euler characteristic of the\nsurface such that for all x \u2208 CC(N ), the convex core of N , there exists a pleated\nsurface \u03a3 such that d(x, \u03a3) \u2264 \u03b4.\n4.6. Proof of Uniform Graph-Quasiconvexity. We need to prove the uniform\ngraph quasiconvexity of split components.\nLet B s be a split block with a splitting l-thin Margulis tube T . We aim at\nshowing:\nProposition 4.23. Uniform Graph Quasiconvexity of Split Components:\ne is uniformly graph-quasiconvex in (M\nf, dG ).\nEach (extended) split component K\nThe proof of Proposition 4.23 will occupy this entire subsection.\nLet B s \u2282 B = S \u00d7 I be S\na split block with horizontal boundary consisting of\ns\nsplit surfaces Sjs , Sj+1\n. Let i Ti be the union of l-thin Margulis tubes splitting\nB s (we suppress the dependence on the index j for the time being). Let K be a\nsplit component. Then K = (S1 \u00d7 I) topologically for a subsurface S1 of S. Also,\nlet \u2202s K = \u2202S1 \u00d7 I denoteSthe collection of boundary annuli of K that abut the\nsplitting tubes. Let \u2202S1 = i \u03c3i = \u03c3 be the finite collection of boundary curves. \u03c3\nis thus a multicurve. EachS\u03c3i is homotopic to the core curve of an l-thin splitting\nMargulis tube Ti . Let T = i Ti . T will be referred to as a multi-Margulis tube.\nWe have already shown in Lemma 4.16 that \u03c01 (S1 ) \u2282 \u03c01 (S) includes into \u03c01 (N )\nas a geometrically finite subgroup of P Sl2 (C). Let N1 be the cover of N corresponding to \u03c01 (K) = \u03c01 (S1 ). Then N1 is geometrically finite. Let T1 be the\nmulti-Margulis tube in N1 that consists of tubes that are (individually) isometric\nto individual components of the multi-Margulis tube T.\nLet N1d be the hyperbolic manifold obtained from N1 by drilling out the core\ncurves of T1 . Since N1 is geometrically finite, so is N1d .\nWe first observe that the boundary of the augmented Scott core X of N1d is\nincompressible away from cusps. To see this, note that X is double covered by a\ncopy of D \u00d7 I with solid tori drilled out of it, where D is the double of S1 (obtained\nby doubling S1 along its boundary circles).\nIdentify X with the convex core CC(N1d ) of N1d . We also identify D with the\nconvex core boundary. Since D is incompressible away from cusps, we have the\nfollowing.\nLemma 4.24. (Chapter 8, [Thu80]) D is a pleated surface.\nSince N1 is the cover of N corresponding to \u03c01 (K) \u2282 \u03c01 (N ), K lifts to an\nembedding into N1 . Adjoin the multi-Margulis tube T1 to (the lifted) K to get an\naugmented split component K1 . Let K1d \u2282 N1d denote K1 with the components\nof T1 drilled. We want to show that D lies within a uniformly bounded distance of\nK1d in the lifted graph metric on N1d . This would be enough to prove a version of\nProposition 4.23 for the drilled manifold N1d as the split geometry structure gives\nrise to a graph metric on N , hence a graph metric on N1 and hence again, a graph\n\n\f38\n\nMAHAN MJ\n\nmetric on N1d . Finally, we shall use the Theorem 4.21 to complete the proof of\nProposition 4.23.\nLemma 4.25. There exists C1 such that for any split component K, D lies within\na uniformly bounded neighborhood of K1d in N1d .\nProof. Case 1: D \u2229 K1d 6= \u2205\nIf D intersects K1d , then the Lemma follows directly from Lemma 4.18: Incompressible pleated surfaces have bounded diameter in the graph metric dG .\nCase 2: D \u2229 K1d = \u2205\nThis is the more difficult case because a priori D might lie far from K1d . Recall\nthat F : N \u2192 M is a biLipschitz homeomorphism between the hyperbolic manifold\nand the model manifold. Let M1 = F (N1 ). Let B denote the block (split or thick)\nin the model manifold M containing F (K). Let B1 \u2282 M1 denote its lift to M1 . Let\nB1d denote B1 with T1 drilled.\nThen B1d \u2212F (K1d ) is topologically a disjoint union of 'vertically thickened flaring\nannuli' F (Ai ), say. Each Ai \u2282 F \u22121 (B1 ) is of the form S 1 \u00d7 [0, \u221e) where S 1 \u00d7 {0}\nlies on Ti .\nMore elaborately, what this means is the following. Identifying B with S \u00d7 I,\nwe may identify B1 with S1a \u00d7 I, where S1a is the cover of S corresponding to the\nsubgroup \u03c01 (S1 ) \u2282 \u03c01 (S). Then S1a may be regarded as S1 union a finite collection\nof flaring annuli F (Ai ) (one for each boundary component of S1 ). Thus B1 is the\nunion of a core F (K1 ) and a collection of vertically thickened flaring annuli of the\nform F (Ai ) \u00d7 I. Hence B1d is the union of a core F (K1d ) and the collection of\nvertically thickened flaring annuli F (Ai ) \u00d7 I. Also the boundary \u2202Ai = Ai \u2229 Ti is a\ncurve of fixed length \u01eb0 . Let us fix one such annulus A1 . Refer figure below (where\nwe have removed subscripts for convenience):\n\nX\nD\n\nK\n\nA\n\nFigure: Graph Quasiconvexity\nRecall that D bounds X and X contains K1d .

Hence D\u01eb must contain an\nannulus of the form \u03b1 \u00d7 I1 \u2282 F (A1 ) \u00d7 I1 . Also the the length of I1 is at least hL0 ,\nwhere L is the biLipschitz constant for F . Since this is true for all \u01eb, it is also true\nfor the pleated surface D. Hence for at least some t \u2208 I, the length of \u03b1 \u00d7 {t}\nis uniformly bounded (by 2L\u03c0(4g\u22124)\n) by the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem applied to D.\nh0\nMuch more is true in fact, but this is enough for our purposes.\nSince \u03b1 \u00d7 {t} \u2282 A1 \u00d7 {t} and the latter is an exponentially flaring annulus,\nit follows that there exist uniform constants C0 > 0, \u03b7 > 1 such that if d(\u03b1 \u00d7\n{t}, \u2202(A1 \u00d7 {t}) \u2265 d0 then the length of \u03b1 \u00d7 {t} is bounded below by C0 \u03b7 d0 .\nThese two estimates imply that there is some point p \u2208 \u03b1 \u00d7 {t} \u2282 D such that\nd(p, T1 ) is uniformly bounded (in terms of the genus of S and the minimal height\nof split blocks h0 ), where T1 is the drilled Margulis tube intersecting A1 \u00d7 {t}\nnon-trivially.\nBy Lemma 4.18 and using the biLipschitz homeomorphism F between N1d and\nM1d , the diameter of D is uniformly bounded in the graph metric lifted to M1d .\nHence, by the triangle inequality, D lies in a uniformly bounded neighborhood of K\nin the graph metric (using either of the descriptions of the graph metric in Remark\n4.12).\n\u0003\nAn Alternate Proof of Lemma 4.25: A simpler proof of the fact that D lies in\na uniformly bounded neighborhood of K1 in the graph metric may alternately be\nobtained directly as follows. First, that M1 is geometrically finite by the Covering\nTheorem of Thurston [Thu80] and Canary [Can96] (See Lemma 4.16). Next, by a\ntheorem of Canary and Minsky [CM96], it follows that the convex hull boundary D\nof M1 can be approximated by simplicial hyperbolic surfaces (see [CM96] for details)\nhomotopic to D with short tracks. Thus any simplicial hyperbolic approximant Da\nwould have to have bounded area and hence bounded diameter modulo Margulis\ntubes (as in Lemma 4.19). Thus so would D. Now, we repeat the argument in the\nproof of Lemma 4.26, to conclude that D and hence the convex core CC(M1 ) of\nM1 lies in a uniformly bounded neighborhood of K1 in the graph metric. \u2737\nThis approach would circumvent the use of the Drilling Theorem at this stage.\nHowever, since we shall again need it below, we retain our approach here.\nSince D bounds X, we would like to claim that the conclusion of Lemma 4.25\nfollows with X in place of D. Though this does not a priori follow in the hyperbolic\nmetric, it does follow for the graph metric. This is because the double cover of X\nis a 'drilled quasifuchsian' manifold (i.e. it is essentially (D \u00d7 I) with some short\ncurves drilled). Further, any point in the convex core of a quasifuchsian (D \u00d7 I) is\nclose to a pleated surface by Theorem 4.22. Essentially the same argument as in\nLemma 4.25 applies now. Details will be given below.\nLemma 4.26. There exists C1 such that for any split component K, K1d is uniformly graph-quasiconvex in M1d .\nProof. X is double covered by D \u00d7 I with cores of some Margulis tubes drilled. Let\nX1 denote this double cover. Note that X1 is convex, being a double cover of the\nconvex compact X. By Theorem 4.21, there exists l > 0 such that the drilled and\n\n\f40\n\nMAHAN MJ\n\nundrilled manifolds are 2-biLipschitz homeomorphic away from Margulis tubes and\ncusps provided the Margulis tubes are l-thin.\nPerform (1, m) Dehn filling on X1 with sufficiently large m = m(l) to ensure\nthat the resulting Margulis tube is l-thin. Let X1f be the resulting Dehn-filled\nmanifold. By Theorem 4.21, X1f is uniformly quasiconvex in M1f = H3 /\u0393 where\n\u0393 is a quasiFuchsian surface group obtained by the above Dehn filling. (Theorem\n4.21 gives a uniform biLipschitz map outside Margulis tubes.)\nNext, by Theorem 4.22, for all x \u2208 X1f there exists a pleated surface \u03a3 \u2282 X1f\nsuch that d(x, \u03a3) \u2264 \u03b4 where \u03b4 depends only on the genus of D.\nReturning to X1 via the Drilling Theorem 4.21 we see that for all x \u2208 X1 ,\n(1) Either there exists a uniformly biLipschitz image of a hyperbolic surface\n\u03a31 \u2282 X1 such that d(x, \u03a31 ) \u2264 \u03b4. This is the case that the pleated surface\n\u03a3 misses all filled Margulis tubes.\n(2) Or, there exists a uniformly biLipschitz image of a subsurface \u03a31 of a hyperbolic surface such that d(x, \u03a31 ) \u2264 \u03b4 and such that the boundary of \u03a31\nlies in a Margulis tube. This is the case that the pleated surface \u03a3 meets\nsome filled Margulis tubes. Here, we can take \u03a31 to be the image of the\ncomponent of (\u03a3 minus Margulis tubes) that lies near x.\nAgain, passing down to X under the double cover (from X1 to X), we have, for\nall x \u2208 X,\n(1) Either there exists a uniformly biLipschitz image of a hyperbolic surface\n\u03a31 \u2282 X parallel to D such that d(x, \u03a31 ) \u2264 \u03b4.\n(2) Or, there exists a uniformly biLipschitz image of a subsurface \u03a31 of a hyperbolic surface such that d(x, \u03a31 ) \u2264 \u03b4 and such that the boundary of \u03a31\nlies on a Margulis tube. Further, \u03a31 is incompressible in the complement\nof l-thin Margulis tubes.\nIn either case, the argument for Lemma 4.25 now shows that for all x \u2208 X the\ndistance dG (x, K1d ) is uniformly bounded in the graph-metric dG . Thus, we have\nshown that K1d is uniformly graph-quasiconvex in M1d .\n\u0003\nTo complete the proof of Proposition 4.23 it is necessary to translate the content\nof Lemma 4.26 to the 'undrilled' manifold N1 . We shall need to invoke the Drilling\nTheorem 4.21 again.\nConcluding the Proof of Proposition 4.23:\nWhile recovering data about N1 , it is slightly easier to handle the case where\nD \u2229 K1d = \u2205. Since we shall use the convex core boundary for both the drilled as\nwell as the undrilled manifolds in the rest of the proof, we change notation slightly\nand use\na) Dd for the convex core boundary of the drilled manifold Nd .\nb) D for the convex core boundary of the undrilled manifold N .\nCase 1: Dd \u2229 K1d = \u2205\nFilling N1d along the (drilled) T1 , we get back N1 . Since Dd misses K1d , the filled\nimage of X in N1 is C1 -quasiconvex for some C1 , depending on the biLipschitz\nconstant of Theorem 4.21 above. (One can see this easily for instance from the fact\nthat there is a uniform Lipschitz retract of N1d \u2212 X onto Dd ).\nCase 2: Dd \u2229 K1d 6= \u2205\nIf Dd meets some Margulis tubes T1 , we enlarge D to D\u2032 in X1 by letting D\u2032 be\n\n\fCANNON-THURSTON MAPS FOR SURFACE GROUPS\n\n41\n\nthe boundary of X1 = X \u222a T1 . The annular intersections of D with Margulis tubes\nare replaced by boundary annuli contained in the boundary of T1 .\nIt is easy enough to check that X1 is uniformly quasiconvex in the hyperbolic\nf1 of X1 in N\nf1 . Then X\nf1 is a union of X\ne and the\nmetric: look at a universal cover X\nf1 is a 'star' of\nlifts of T that intersect it. All these lifts of T are disjoint. Hence X\ne By (Gromov) \u03b4-hyperbolicity,\nconvex sets all of which intersect the convex set X.\nsuch a set is uniformly quasiconvex.\nThen as before, there is a uniform Lipschitz retract of N1d \u2212 X1 onto D\u2032 . But\nnow D\u2032 misses the interior of K1d and we can apply the previous argument.\nBy Theorem 4.21 above, the diameter of the convex core boundary D (or D\u2032\nif D intersects some Margulis tubes) in N1 is bounded in terms of the diameter\nof the convex core boundary Dd in N1d and the uniform biLipschitz constant L\nobtained from Theorem 4.21 above. Further, the distance of D from K1 \u222a T1 in N1\nis bounded in terms of the distance of Dd from K1d \u222a\u2202T1 in N1d and the biLipschitz\nconstant L.\nHence we can translate the content of Lemma 4.26 to the 'undrilled' manifold\nN1 . This concludes the proof of Proposition 4.23: Split components are uniformly\ngraph-quasiconvex. \u2737\nRemark 4.27. Our proof above uses the fact that the convex core X of N1d is a\nrather well-understood object, namely, a manifold double covered by a drilled convex\nhull of a quasi-Fuchsian group. Hence, it follows that the convex core X is uniformly\ncongested, i.e. it has a uniform upper bound on its injectivity radius. This is an\napproach to a conjecture of McMullen [Bie] (See also Fan [Fan99a] [Fan99b]).\nA further point to be noted is that we have implicitly used here the idea of drilling\ndisk-busting curves introduced by Canary in [Can93] and used again by Agol in his\nresolution of the tameness conjecture [Ago04].\ne by adjoinRemark 4.28.

Since a host of\nmetrics will make their appearance in this section, we shall refer to (quasi)geodesics\n\n\f48\n\nMAHAN MJ\n\ng\nf\n]\n]\nin (M\nwel , dG ), (Mwel , dwel ), (Mtel , dtel ) and (M , dCH ) as dG -(quasi)geodesics, dwel (quasi)geodesics, dtel -(quasi)geodesics and dCH -(quasi)geodesics respectively. Reg\n]\ncall that the union of the horizontal sheets Sei \u2282 M\nwel is denoted as MH and that\ng\nthe projection \u03a0\u03bb occurring in Theorem 5.7 is defined only on MH and not all of\n]\nM\nwel .\n6.1. Scheme of Recovery. The recovery is in several stages. We sketch the\nscheme of recovery in some detail in this subsection for the convenience of the\nreader. A first problem in recovering data about hyperbolic geodesics from dG ]\ngeodesics is the absence of canonical representatives in (M\nwel , dwel ) of dG -geodesics.\n]\nIn Section 6.2, we address this problem by making a choice of paths in (M\nwel , dwel )\nrepresenting dG -geodesics. We call these admissible paths. Roughly speaking, admissible paths are built up of\ne = Se \u00d7 [0, 1], where B is a block\na) vertical segments of the form {x} \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2282 B\ne\n(thick or split) and x \u2208 S.\ng\nb) horizontal segments consisting of geodesics in the horizontal sheets of M\nH.\ne\ne\n]\nLet \u03bb \u2282 S(\u2282 Mwel ) be a geodesic in the intrinsic metric on S, where S is identified\ng\nwith the base surface S \u00d7 {0} of the first block in M\nH . Let \u03b2e denote an admissible\n]\npath representing a dG -geodesic joining the endpoints of \u03bb in (M\nwel , dG ).\nWe would like to project \u03b2e using \u03a0\u03bb onto the ladder L\u03bb to obtain a quasigeodesic\ng\ncontained in L\u03bb . Unfortunately, \u03a0\u03bb is defined only on M\nH and there is no natural\n]\nway to extend it to all of Mwel . To circumvent this problem we first define in\nSection 6.2 a subcollection of the family of admissible paths, called L\u03bb -admissible\npaths. Roughly speaking, L\u03bb -admissible paths are those admissible paths whose\nhorizontal segments lie on or near L\u03bb .\ng\nThen in Section 6.3 we project \u03b2e \u2229 M\nH using \u03a0\u03bb onto the ladder L\u03bb . Since \u03b2e is\nitself an admissible path, there is a sequence of points a1 , b1 , a2 , b2 , * * * , ak , bk such\nthat the piece of \u03b2e joining ai to bi is horizontal, whereas the piece of \u03b2e joining bi\nto ai+1 is vertical. In particular, bi and ai+1 must lie in the same split component\nif they lie in (the universal cover of) a split block. In this case \u03a0\u03bb (bi ) and \u03a0\u03bb (ai+1 )\nmust also lie in the same split component. This allows us to join the sequence of\npoints \u03a0\u03bb (a1 ), \u03a0\u03bb (b1 ), \u03a0\u03bb (a2 ), \u03a0\u03bb (b2 ), * * * , \u03a0\u03bb (ak ), \u03a0\u03bb (bk ) by alternating horizontal\nand vertical segments to obtain an L\u03bb -admissible path \u03b2adm representing a (uni]\nform) dG -quasigeodesic joining the endpoints of \u03bb in (M\nwel , dG ). Lemma 6.5 now\ne then \u03b2adm\nestablishes that if \u03bb lies outside a large ball about a reference point in S,\n]\nalso lies outside a large ball about a reference point in (M\nwel , dwel ).\n]\nIn Section 6.4 we construct an electro-ambient quasigeodesic \u03b2ea in (M\nwel , dG )\nfrom the L\u03bb -admissible path \u03b2adm , constructed in Section 6.3. The idea is simple.\ng\nf\nDenote by K\nij \u2282 Bi the split components in the universal cover of a split block\ng\nBi . Replace the intersection \u03b2adm \u2229 K\nij (of \u03b2adm with any such split component\ng\ng\ng\nKij ) by a geodesic in Kij joining the end-points of \u03b2adm \u2229 K\nij . Then \u03b2ea continues\ne\nto satisfy the conclusions of Lemma 6.5, i.e. if \u03bb lies outside a large ball in S,\n]\nthen \u03b2ea lies outside a large ball in (Mwel , dwel ). What is crucial at this stage of\nf\nthe recovery is the quasiconvexity of Sei and Sg\ni+1 in Bi , where the quasiconvexity\nconstant depends only on i.\n\n\fCANNON-THURSTON MAPS FOR SURFACE GROUPS\n\n49\n\nFinally in Section 6.5, we construct an electro-ambient quasigeodesic \u03b2ea2 in\nf, dCH ) from \u03b2ea . To do this, we first replace \u03b2ea by a path \u03b2ea1 in M\nf such\n(M\nthat \u03b2ea1 coincides with \u03b2ea outside Margulis tubes and consists of hyperbolic\ngeodesic segments within Margulis tubes. Then as above, we replace the intersection\ng\ng\ng\n\u03b2ea1 \u2229 CH(K\nij ) (of \u03b2ea1 with the convex hull CH(Kij ) of a split component Kij )\ng\ng\nby a geodesic in CH(Kij ) joining the end-points of \u03b2ea1 \u2229 CH(Kij ). This gives us\nf, dCH ). Again, \u03b2ea2 continues\nthe required electro-ambient quasigeodesic \u03b2ea2 in (M\ne then\nto satisfy the conclusions of Lemma 6.5, i.e. if \u03bb lies outside a large ball in S,\nf\n\u03b2ea2 lies outside a large ball in M (where the latter is equipped with the model\nmetric). The last statement follows from the uniform graph quasiconvexity of split\ncomponents (Proposition 4.23).\nIt is a small step from here to the main Theorem 7.1 in Section 7; so we mention\nf joining the end-points of\nit here. Lemma 2.5 ensures that the geodesic \u03b2 h in M\n\u03b2ea2 lies in a uniformly bounded neighborhood of \u03b2ea2 (see the figure just after\nLemma 2.5). Note that it is at this stage that we use explicitly the weak relative\nf relative to the collection of convex hulls of split components.\nhyperbolicity of M\nThough \u03b2ea2 could be very far from a hyperbolic geodesic, Lemma 2.5 forces \u03b2 h to\ne then\nlie in a bounded neighborhood of it. Hence if \u03bb lies outside a large ball in S,\nh\nf\n\u03b2 lies outside a large ball in M . Lemma 1.8 now furnishes the Cannon-Thurston\nmap we want.\n6.2. Admissible Paths. We want to first define a collection of paths lying in a\n]\nbounded neighborhood of L\u03bb in (M\nwel , dG ). Since L\u03bb is not connected, it does not\nmake sense to speak of the path-metric on L\u03bb . To remedy this we shall introduce\nin this subsection the class of L\u03bb -elementary admissible paths whose horizontal\ng\npieces are contained in a neighborhood of L\u03bb in M\nH . Further the distance of L\u03bb elementary admissible paths from L\u03bb will be controlled. An L\u03bb -admissible path\nwill be a composition of L\u03bb -elementary admissible paths.\nWe first define admissible paths in general. Let B be a thick or split block in\nMwel . We shall identify B with a product S \u00d7 I as usual. In particular for B a\ne a vertical segment of the form x \u00d7 [0, 1] will be assumed\nsplit block, and any x \u2208 S,\ne \u2282 B.\ne\nto be contained in some split component K\n\ne (\u2282 M\n]\nDefinition 6.1. An admissible path in B\nwel ) is a path that can be decomposed into subpaths of the following two types:\n1) Horizontal segments along some Se \u00d7 {i} for i = {0, 1}.\ne\n2) Vertical segments of the form x \u00d7 [0, 1] where x \u2208 S.\n\n]\nAn admissible path \u03c3 in M\nwel is a path such that for every (thick or split)\ne is an admissible path in B.\ne\nblock B, any connected component of \u03c3 \u2229 B\nAn admissible K\u2212 quasigeodesic is an admissible path that is a K\u2212quasigeodesic\n]\nin (M\nwel , dG ).\nLemma 6.2. Given K \u2265 1 there exists K1 \u2265 1 such that the following holds:\n]\nLet \u03b2e be a (dG \u2212) K\u2212quasigeodesic in (M\nwel , dG ). Then there exists an admissible\n\u2032\nK1 \u2212quasigeodesic \u03b2e joining the end-points of \u03b2e .\nProof. Without loss of generality, we can assume that \u03b2e does not back-track relative to the collection of split components, as any back-tracking can be removed\n\n\f50\n\nMAHAN MJ\n\nwithout increasing the dG \u2212length of \u03b2e (see [Far98] for instance). We shall now\nconvert \u03b2e into an admissible electric quasigeodesic without backtracking joining\nthe same pair of points as \u03b2e . To do this we shall look at connected components\ne for any block B and replace them with admissible paths. We identify\nof \u03b2e \u2229 B\nB with S \u00d7 [0, 1] and we call Se \u00d7 {0} and Se \u00d7 {1} the lower and upper boundary\ne Also let P0 , P1 denote the natural projections from Se \u00d7 [0, 1] to\ncomponents of B.\ne\ne\nS \u00d7 {0} and S \u00d7 {1} respectively given by P0 (x, t) = (x, 0) and P1 (x, t) = (x, 1).\ne 6= \u2205. Let \u03b21 be a connected\nNow let B be a block (thick or split) and let \u03b2e \u2229 B\ne\ncomponent of \u03b2e \u2229 B. Let b1 , b2 be the end-points of \u03b21 . Two cases arise.\nIf both b1 , b2 belong to the same boundary component, then we replace \u03b21 by\n\u03b21\u2032 = Pi (\u03b21 ), where i = 0 or 1 according as b1 , b2 \u2208 Se \u00d7 {0} or Se \u00d7 {1}.\nIf b1 , b2 belong to different boundary components, then assume without loss of\ngenerality that b1 \u2208 Se \u00d7 {0} and let b2 = (z, 1) \u2208 Se \u00d7 {1}. Then replace \u03b21 by\n\u03b21\u2032 = P0 (\u03b21 ) \u222a {z} \u00d7 [0, 1].\nPerforming this replacement for every block B and every connected component\ne we obtain the required admissible quasigeodesic \u03b2e\u2032 joining the end-points\nof \u03b2e \u2229 B\nof \u03b2e .\nIt remains to show that if \u03b2e is a (dG \u2212) K\u2212quasigeodesic, then \u03b2e\u2032 is indeed an\nadmissible K1 \u2212quasigeodesic, where K1 depends only on K.\ne is the same as the dG length\nFor B a split block, the dG length of any \u03b21 \u2282 B\n\u2032\nof the corresponding \u03b21 constructed to replace it as above. This is because the dG\nlength of \u03b21 is equal to the number of split blocks that \u03b21 cuts.\ne is a uniform\nFor B a thick block, the inclusion of Se \u00d7 {0} (or Se \u00d7 {1}) into B\nquasi-isometry as the thickness of thick blocks is uniformly bounded. Hence \u03b21\u2032 is\na K1 \u2212quasigeodesic where K1 depends only on K. The Lemma follows.\n\u0003\nWe shall now choose a subclass of these admissible paths to define L\u03bb -elementary\nadmissible paths. The constants C, C(B), K(B) etc. below will be independent of\nthe geodesic \u03bb, the initial geodesic in the ladder L\u03bb .\nL\u03bb -elementary admissible paths in the thick block\nLet B = S \u00d7 [i, i + 1] be a thick block, where each (x, i) is connected by a vertical\nsegment to (x, i + 1). Let \u03c6 be the map that takes (x, i) to (x, i + 1). Also let \u03a6\ne = \u03bbi \u222a \u03bbi+1 where \u03bbi lies on\nbe the map on geodesics induced by \u03c6.

It depends only on the model manifold M .\nThe same conclusions hold for \u03c6\u22121 and points in \u03bbi+1 , where \u03c6\u22121 denotes the\nquasi-isometric inverse of \u03c6 from Se \u00d7 {i + 1} to Se \u00d7 {i}. The L\u03bb -elementary\ne are defined to be paths consisting of the following:\nadmissible paths in B\n1) Horizontal geodesic subsegments of \u03bbj , j = {i, i + 1}.\n2) Vertical segments of dG length 1 joining x \u00d7 {0} to x \u00d7 {1}.

As before we regard \u03c6 as the map from Se \u00d7 {i} to Se \u00d7 {i + 1}\nthat is the identity on the first component. Also let \u03a6 be the map on electroe=S\nambient quasigeodesics induced by \u03c6.

Hence, by Lemma\n5.3, we can join \u03a0\u03bb (p), \u03a0\u03bb (q) by an L\u03bb -admissible path of length bounded by some\nC0 (independent of B, \u03bb).\nFor a thick block, we define the L\u03bb -admissible path joining \u03a0\u03bb (p), \u03a0\u03bb (q) to be\nany such L\u03bb -admissible path of uniformly bounded dwel \u2212length.\nfi of dG length one and dwel \u2212\n2) Let [p, q] be a vertical segment in a split block B\ne\nfi and\nlength \u2264 li joining p, q, where p \u2208 Si , the lower horizontal boundary of B\ng\nf\nq \u2208 Si+1 , the upper horizontal boundary of Bi . Since p, q lie within a split component, dG (\u03a0\u03bb (p), \u03a0\u03bb (q)) = 1, that is to say \u03a0\u03bb (p), \u03a0\u03bb (q) also lie within a split\ncomponent. This is because the projection of a split component lies within a single\nsplit component. Hence there exists an admissible path [\u03a0\u03bb (p), \u03a0\u03bb (q)] of dG length\none joining \u03a0\u03bb (p), \u03a0\u03bb (q). Further, by Lemma 5.3 again, we can join \u03a0\u03bb (p), \u03a0\u03bb (q)\nby an L\u03bb -admissible path of dwel \u2212length bounded by some Ci (dependent on Bi\n\n\f54\n\nMAHAN MJ\n\nbut independent of \u03bb). Note that, since Ci depends on Bi , it depends on li in\nparticular.\n3) By Remark 5.6 the two images under nearest projection of a point in Sei onto\nrespectively a hyperbolic geodesic and an electro-ambient quasigeodesic in Sei (joining any pair of points) are a uniformly bounded (biLipschitz)-hyperbolic distance\napart. Hence, by Lemma 5.5, we can join them by an L\u03bb -admissible path of length\nbounded by some uniform C1 (independent of Bi , \u03bb).\nA clarificatory remark as to why segments of type (3) are necessary: In defining\nL\u03bb , we have had to make a choice. Suppose \u03bbi \u2282 Sei . Then Si is the common\nboundary of two blocks. In case both are split blocks then there is a choice of \u03bbi\nout of two electro-ambient quasigeodesics involved. If one is a split block and the\nother a thick block, then there is a choice of \u03bbi involved out of an electro-ambient\nquasigeodesic and a geodesic. The different nearest point projections corresponding\nto the different choices of \u03bbi differ by a uniformly bounded amount (Remark 5.6).\nSegments of type (3) take care of this bounded discrepancy.\nFor a split block, we define the L\u03bb -admissible path joining \u03a0\u03bb (p), \u03a0\u03bb (q) to consist of one L\u03bb -admissible path constructed in Step (2) above and (at most) two\nsegments of uniformly bounded dwel \u2212length as in Step (3). Thus an L\u03bb -admissible\npath joining \u03a0\u03bb (p), \u03a0\u03bb (q) contains one vertical segment of type (2) typically sandwiched between two segments of type (3).\nJoining \u03a0\u03bb (ai ), \u03a0\u03bb (bi ) by [\u03a0\u03bb (ai ), \u03a0\u03bb (bi )] and \u03a0\u03bb (bi ), \u03a0\u03bb (ai+1 ) by L\u03bb -admissible\npaths as above, we obtain the required L\u03bb admissible (dG ) K\u2212 quasigeodesic\n]\n\u03b2adm \u2282 M\nwel .\nBy Theorem 5.7, there exists K \u2265 1 such that \u03b2adm represents a (dG )-Kquasigeodesic. This proves statement (1) of the Lemma.\nAfter \"joining the dots\" by L\u03bb -admissible paths as above, we can assume further\nthat the L\u03bb -admissible quasigeodesic \u03b2adm thus obtained does not backtrack relative\nto split components. Conclusion (2) of the Lemma now follows from Lemma 6.5\nsince we have obtained an admissible quasigeodesic built up out of L\u03bb -admissible\npaths.\n\u0003\n6.4. Recovering Electro-ambient Quasigeodesics I. This subsection is de]\nvoted to extracting an electro-ambient quasigeodesic \u03b2ea in (M\nwel , dG ) from an L\u03bb admissible quasigeodesic \u03b2adm . \u03b2ea shall satisfy the property indicated by Lemma\n6.7 above.\nLemma 6.8.

From Lemma 6.7, we have an L\u03bb - admissible \u03ba-quasigeodesic \u03b2adm without\ne and a function\nbacktracking (with respect to the collection K of split components K)\nM (N ) satisfying the conclusions of the Lemma. Since \u03b2adm does not backtrack, we\ncan decompose it as a union of non-overlapping segments \u03b21 , * * * \u03b2k , such that only\nsuccessive \u03b2i 's intersect at one common end-point and each \u03b2i is\na) either an L\u03bb - admissible quasigeodesic lying outside split components,\nb) or an L\u03bb -admissible quasigeodesic lying entirely within some split component\ne n(i) . Further, since \u03b2adm does not backtrack relative to split components, we can\nK\ne n(i) 's are distinct, i.e. i 6= j \u21d2 K\ne n(i) 6= K\ne n(j) .\nassume that all K\n]\nWe modify \u03b2adm to an electro-ambient quasigeodesic \u03b2ea in (M\nwel , dG ) as per\nthe following recipe:\n1) \u03b2ea coincides with \u03b2adm outside split components.\ne n(i) , then we replace it by a geodesic\n2) If some \u03b2i lies within a split component K\ne n(i) joining the end-points of \u03b2i . Of course \u03b2 ea lies\n\u03b2iea in the intrinsic metric on K\ni\ne\nwithin Kn(i) .\nSince \u03b2ea coincides with \u03b2adm outside split components and since \u03b2adm is a\n(dG ) \u03ba-quasigeodesic, therefore \u03b2ea represents a (dG ) \u03ba-quasigeodesic. Hence, the\nresultant path \u03b2ea is an electro-ambient \u03ba-quasigeodesic without backtracking.\nNext, since any amalgamation component of Se is quasiconvex in the split come containing it, each segment \u03b2 ea lies in a Ci neighborhood of \u03b2i . Here Ci\nponent K\ni\ndepends on the quasiconvexity constants of the amalgamation components in split\ncomponents and hence only on the thickness li of the split component Kn(i) .\nWe let C(m) denote the maximum of the (finitely many) values of Ci for the\ng\nsplit components of B\nm , where we take C(m) = 0 if Bm is thick (this makes sense\nas \u03b2ea coincides with \u03b2adm outside split components).

Modifications for Surfaces with Punctures\nIn this section, we shall describe the modifications necessary to prove Theorem\n7.1 for surfaces with punctures.\n8.1. Partial Electrocution. Two general references for this subsection are [MR08],\n[MP11], where much of what follows is done in a considerably more general setting.\nLet M be a convex hyperbolic 3-manifold with a neighborhood of the cusps\nexcised. Then each component of the boundary of M is of the form \u03c3 \u00d7 P , where P\nis either an interval or a circle, and \u03c3 is a horocycle of some fixed length e0 . Each\nf, is a flat horosphere of the\ncomponent of the boundary of the universal cover M\nform \u03c3\ne \u00d7 P\u0303 . Note that P\u0303 = P if P is an interval, and R if P is a circle (the case\nfor a (Z + Z)-cusp).\nThe construction of partially electrocuted horospheres below is half way between\nthe spirit of Farb's construction (in Lemmas 2.3, 2.9, where the entire horosphere\nis coned off), and McMullen's Theorem 2.13 (where nothing is coned off, and properties of ambient quasigeodesics are investigated).\nPartial Electrocution of Horospheres\nLet Y be a convex simply connected hyperbolic 3-manifold. Let B denote a collection of horoballs. Let X denote Y minus the interior of the horoballs in B. Let H\ndenote the collection of boundary horospheres.Then each H\u03b1 \u2208 H with the induced\n\n\f60\n\nMAHAN MJ\n\nmetric is isometric to a Euclidean product E 1 \u00d7 L\u03b1 for an interval L\u03b1 \u2282 R. Here\nE 1 denotes Euclidean 1-space.\n\"Partially electrocute\" each H\u03b1 by giving it the product of the zero metric with\nthe Euclidean metric, i.e. on E 1 put the zero metric and on L\u03b1 put the Euclidean\nmetric. Thus we are in the following situation:\n(1) X is (strongly) hyperbolic relative to a collection H of horospheres.\n(2) Each horosphere H\u03b1 is equipped with a pseudometric making it isometric\nto a Euclidean product E 1 \u00d7 L\u03b1 for an interval L\u03b1 \u2282 R. We shall denote\nthe collection of L\u03b1 's by L.\nThe resulting pseudometric space is denoted (X, dpel ) and is called the partially\nelectrocuted space associated to the pair (X, H).\nIts worth pointing out here that (X, dpel ) is essentially what one would get (in the\nspirit of [Far98]) by gluing to each H\u03b1 the mapping cylinder of the projection of H\u03b1\nonto the L\u03b1 -factor. Let G denote the collection of these projections g\u03b1 : H\u03b1 \u2192 L\u03b1 .\nThus, instead of coning all of a horosphere down to a point we cone only horocyclic\nleaves of a foliation of the horosphere. Effectively, therefore, we have a cone-line\nrather than a cone-point. We shall denote the union of X and all the mapping\ncylinders of g\u03b1 by E(X, H, L, G) in the spirit of the notation we have used for electric\nspaces. As pointed out above, E(X, H, L, G) and (X, dpel ) are quasi-isometric and\nboth contain naturally embedded copies of X as a subset (though not as a metric\nsubspace). We shall therefore conflate E(X, H, L, G) and (X, dpel ) in this subsection.\nGeodesics and quasigeodesics in the partially electrocuted space will be referred to\nas partially electrocuted geodesics and quasigeodesics respectively.\nIn this situation, we conclude as in Lemma 2.3:\nLemma 8.1. (Lemma 1.20 of [MP11]) For a 4-tuple (X, H, L, G) as above, E(X, H, L, G)\n(resp. (X, dpel )) is a hyperbolic metric spaces and L\u03b1 \u2282 E(X, H, L, G) (resp.\nH\u03b1 \u2282 (X, dpel )) are uniformly quasiconvex.\nRecall that X is obtained from a simply connected convex hyperbolic manifold\nY by excising a family of uniformly separated (open) horoballs.\nLemma 8.2. (Lemma 1.21 of [MP11]) Let (X, H, L, G) be a 4-tuple as above. Given\nK, \u01eb \u2265 0, there exists C > 0 such that the following holds:\nLet \u03b3pel and \u03b3 denote respectively a (K, \u01eb) partially electrocuted quasigeodesic in\nE(X,\nS H, L, G) and a (K, \u01eb) hyperbolic quasigeodesic in Y joining a, b. Then \u03b3 \\\nH\u03b1 \u2208H H\u03b1 lies in a C-neighborhood of (any representative of ) \u03b3pel in (X, d). Further, outside of the horoballs that \u03b3 meets, \u03b3 and \u03b3pel track each other, i.e. they lie\nin a C-neighborhood of each other.\nNote: E(X, H, L, G) is strongly hyperbolic relative to the sets {L\u03b1 }. In fact\nthe space obtained by electrocuting the sets L\u03b1 in E(X, H, L, G) is just the space\nE(X, H) obtained by electrocuting the sets {H\u03b1 } in X.\nNext, we show that partial electrocution preserves quasiconvexity.\nLemma 8.3. Given C there exists C1 such that if A and A \u2229 B (for any horoball\nB \u2208 B) are C-quasiconvex in Y , then (A \u2229 X, dpel ) is C1 -quasiconvex in (X, dpel ).\nProof. It is given that A(\u2282 Y ) as also A \u2229 B for all B \u2208 B are C-quasiconvex.\nThen given a, b \u2208 A \u2229 X, the hyperbolic geodesic \u03bb in Y joining a, b lies in a\nC-neighborhood of A. Since horoballs are convex, \u03bb cannot backtrack. We let\n\n\fCANNON-THURSTON MAPS FOR SURFACE GROUPS\n\n61\n\nH = \u2202B be the boundary horosphere of the horoball B, and let L be the element\nof L corresponding to H.\nLet \u03bbpel be the partially electrocuted geodesic joining a, b \u2208 (X, dpel ). Clearly,\n\u03bbpel does not backtrack. Then by Lemma 8.2 above, we conclude that for all\nH \u2208 H that \u03bb intersects, there exist points aH , bH of \u03bbpel close (in Y ) to the entry\nand exit points of \u03bb with respect to H. The points aH , bH therefore lie close to\nA \u2229 H. Further, the corresponding L (resp. H) is quasiconvex in E(X, H, L, G)\n(resp. (X, dpel )) by Lemma 8.1. It follows that \u03bbpel \u2229 L (resp. \u03bbpel \u2229 H) lies within\na uniformly bounded distance of A \u2229 H in E(X, H, L, G) (resp. (X, dpel )). The\nconclusion now follows from Lemma 8.2.\n\u0003\n8.2. Split geometry for Surfaces with Punctures. Recall that N h denotes\n(the convex core of) a simply or doubly degenerate hyperbolic 3-manifold with\ncusps. N will denote N h minus an open neighborhood of the cusps. M will denote\nthe model manifold (Section 3) biLipschitz homeomorphic to N . Since the proof\nin the case of surfaces with punctures is only a small modification of the case of\nsurfaces without punctures modulo known results (cf. [MP11, Mj09]), we shall only\nsketch the proof, indicating the necessary changes.\nIt is worth noting here that the purpose of the partial electrocution operation\nin the previous subsection is to ensure that successive split surfaces with boundary\nare uniformly separated so as to ensure a model of weak split geometry as defined\nin Remark 4.9. We shall proceed to construct a split geometry structure on M\noutlined in the steps below. In Steps (1)-(4) below we set up the model manifold of\nsplit geometry for S with boundary.\nStep 1: Preliminary\nFor a hyperbolic surface S h (possibly) with punctures, we fix a (small) e0 , and excise\nthe cusps leaving horocyclic boundary components of (ordinary or Euclidean) length\ne0 . We then take the induced path metric on S h minus cusps and call the resulting\nsurface S. This induced path metric will still be referred to as the hyperbolic metric\non S (with the understanding that now S possibly has boundary). Note that the\nhorocycle boundary components are now totally geodesic in S.\nStep 2: Definition of Thick and Split Blocks and Hyperbolic Quasiconvexity of Split Components\nA thick block in M is uniformly biLipschitz to S \u00d7 I as before.\nThe definitions and constructions of split building blocks and split components now go through with very little change. The only difference is that S now\nmight have boundary curves of length e0 .\nf) of split comThere is one subtle point about hyperbolic quasiconvexity (in M\nponents. Hyperbolic quasiconvexity (cf. Lemma 4.16) does not hold in the metric\nobtained by merely excising the cusps and equipping the resulting horospheres with\nthe Euclidean metric. What we demand is that each split component along with\nthe parts of the horoballs that abut it be quasiconvex in N \u0303h . Note that the intersecf with horoballs that abut it are (metric) products of\ntion of split components in M\nhorocycles with closed intervals. Lemma 4.16 furnishes the required quasiconvexity\nin this case.\nWhen we excise horoballs from N h to obtain N and then partially electrocute\nhorospheres in N (or its biLipschitz model M ) in Step 3 below, and consider quasiconvexity in the resulting partially electrocuted space, split components will remain\nquasiconvex by Lemma 8.3.\n\n\f62\n\nMAHAN MJ\n\nStep 3: Partially Electrocuting Horospherical Boundaries in M\nNext, we modify the metric on M by partially electrocuting its boundary horospherical components so that the metric on the horospherical boundary components of\nany (thick or split) block S \u00d7I is the product of the zero metric on the horocycles of\nfixed (Euclidean) length e0 and the Euclidean metric on the I-factor. The resulting\nblocks will be called partially electrocuted blocks. Note that Mpel may also be\nconstructed directly from M by excising a neighborhood of the cusps and partially\nfpel is a hyperbolic metric\nelectrocuting the resulting horospheres. By Lemma 8.1 M\nspace and by Lemma 8.3, partially electrocuted split components are quasiconvex\nfpel .\nin M\nfpel and Graph Quasiconvexity\nStep 4: Split Blocks in M\nAgain, the definitions and constructions of split blocks and split components go\nfpel . By Lemma\nthrough mutatis mutandis for the partially electrocuted manifold M\n8.3, quasiconvexity of split components as well as quasiconvexity of lifts of Margulis\ntubes is preserved by partial electrocution. Hence in the model Mpel obtained by\ngluing together partially electrocuted blocks, the split components are uniformly\ngraph-quasiconvex.\nIn Steps (5)-(7) we indicate the modifications in the construction and use of the\nladder L\u03bb and the retract \u03a0\u03bb .\nStep 5: Horo-ambient quasigeodesics\nLet \u03bbh be a hyperbolic geodesic in S \u0303h . We replace pieces of \u03bbh that lie within\nhorodisks by shortest horocyclic segments joining its entry and exit points (into the\ncorresponding horodisk). Such a path is called a horo-ambient quasigeodesic\ncf. [Mj09]. See Figure below:\n\nFigure:Horo-ambient quasigeodesic\nA small modification might be introduced if we electrocute horocycles. Geodesics\nand quasigeodesics without backtracking then travel for free along the zero metric\nhorocycles. This does not change matters much as the geodesics and quasigeodesics\nin the two constructions track each other by Lemma 2.9.\nThus, our starting point for the construction of the hyperbolic ladder L\u03bb is not\na hyperbolic geodesic \u03bbh but a horoambient quasigeodesic \u03bb.\nStep 6: Construction of the ladder L\u03bb\nThe construction of L\u03bb , \u03a0\u03bb and their properties go through mutatis mutandis and\nfpel , dG ) on the partially\nwe conclude that L\u03bb is quasiconvex in the graph metric (M\nf\ng\nelectrocuted space Mpel . As before, MH pel will denote the collection of horizontal\nsheets.\n\n\fCANNON-THURSTON MAPS FOR SURFACE GROUPS\n\n63\n\nThe modification of Theorem 5.7 in this context is given below:\nTheorem 8.4. There exists C > 0 such that for any horo-ambient geodesic \u03bb =\nf0 , the retraction \u03a0\u03bb : M\ng\n\u03bb0 \u2282 Se \u00d7 {0} \u2282 B\nH pel \u2192 L\u03bb satisfies:\ndG (\u03a0\u03bb (x), \u03a0\u03bb (y)) \u2264 CdG (x, y) + C.\n\nStep 7: Decomposing the ladder L\u03bb into Lc\u03bb and Lb\u03bb\nFrom this step on, the modifications for punctured surfaces follow [Mj09]. As in\n[Mj09], we decompose \u03bb into parts \u03bbc and \u03bbb consisting of (closures of) maximal\nsegments that lie along horocycles and complementary pieces that do not intersect\nhorocycles. Accordingly, we decompose L\u03bb into two parts Lc\u03bb and Lb\u03bb consisting of\nparts that lie along horocycles and those that do not. As in Lemma 6.5, we get\nLemma 8.5. There exists a function M (N ) : N \u2192 N such that M (N ) \u2192 \u221e as\nN \u2192 \u221e for which the following holds:\nf0 , a fixed reference point\nFor any horo-ambient quasigeodesic \u03bb \u2282 Se \u00d7 {0} \u2282 B\nb\nf0 and any x on L ,\np \u2208 Se \u00d7 {0} \u2282 B\n\u03bb\nd(\u03bbb , p) \u2265 N \u21d2 dwel (x, p) \u2265 M (N ).\nIn Steps (8)-(10) we indicate the process of recovering a hyperbolic geodesic.\nStep 8: Projecting and joining the dots\nf0\nAdmissible paths are constructed as in Section 6.2. Now if \u03bb \u2282 Se \u00d7 {0} \u2282 B\nis a horo-ambient geodesic joining a, b, let \u03b2 be an admissible path representing a\ng\n]\ndG geodesic in M\npel . Project \u03b2 \u2229 MH pel onto L\u03bb by \u03a0\u03bb and \"join the dots\" as in\nSection 6.3 to get a connected ambient electric quasigeodesic \u03b2amb .\nStep 9: Recovery\nf a partially electrocuted\nAs in Sections 6.4 and 6.5, construct from \u03b2amb \u2282 M\nf\nquasigeodesic \u03b3 in (Mpel , dpel ).

Hence, by Lemma 8.5 if \u03bbh lies\npartially electrocuted horospheres lie close to Lb\u03bbS\nh\noutside large balls in S then each point of \u03b3 \\ H\u03b1 \u2208H H\u03b1 also lies outside large\nf.\nballs in M\nfh minus horoballs). Let\ne (=N\nAt this stage we transfer the information to N\nF : M \u2192 N be the biLipschitz homeomorphism between M and N and let Fe\nh\ndenote its lift between universal covers.

However in the present situation of surfaces with punchyperbolic geodesic in M\ntures, one more step of recovery is necessary.\nStep 10: Conclusion\ne h joining the end-points of Fe (\u03b3). By\nLet \u03b3 h denote the hyperbolic geodesic in N\nh\nLemma 8.2 Fe (\u03b3) and \u03b3 track each other away from horoballs. Then, every point\ne must lie close to some point of Fe(\u03b3) lying outside partially electrocuted\nof \u03b3 h \u2229 N\nhorospheres. Hence from Step (9), if \u03bbh lies outside a large ball about p in S h then\ne also lies outside a large ball about p in N\ne . In particular, \u03b3 h enters and leaves\n\u03b3h \u2229 N\nhoroballs at large distances from p. From this it follows (See Theorem 5.9 of [Mj09]\n\n\f64\n\nMAHAN MJ\n\nfor instance) that \u03b3 h itself lies outside a large ball about p. Hence by Lemma 1.8\nthere exists a Cannon-Thurston map and the limit set is locally connected.\nWe summarize the conclusion below:\nTheorem 8.6. Let N h be a simply or doubly degenerate 3 manifold homeomorphic\nto S h \u00d7J (for J = [0, \u221e) or (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) respectively) for S h a finite volume hyperbolic\nsurface such that i : S h \u2192 M h is a proper map inducing a homotopy equivalence.\ne h extends continuously to a map \u00ee : Sbh \u2192 N\nb h . Hence\nThen the inclusion i : Seh \u2192 N\nh\ne\nthe limit set of S is locally connected.\n\nA part of the argument in Lemmas 6.8 and 6.10 and Step 9 above does not use\nthe full strength of the hypothesis that M is a model for a surface group. If we\nonly assume that each end E of a manifold M is equipped with a split geometry\nstructure where each split component is incompressible, then the same arguments\nfurnish the following.\n\nLemma 8.7. Let N be the convex core of a complete hyperbolic 3\u2212manifold N h\nminus a neighborhood of the cusps. Equip each degenerate end with a split geometry\nstructure such that each split component is incompressible. Let M be the resulting\nmodel of split geometry and F : N \u2192 M be the bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism between\nthe two. Let Fe be a lift of F to the universal covers. Then for all C0 > 0, and\ne there exists a function \u0398 : N \u2192 N satisfying \u0398(n) \u2192 \u221e as n \u2192 \u221e such that\no\u2208N\nthe following holds.\nfh , let \u03bbh be the hyperbolic geodesic in N\nfh joining them and let\ne \u2282N\nFor any a, b \u2208 N\nh\nh\nh\ne\n\u03bbthick = \u03bb \u2229 N . Similarly let \u03b2ea be an electro-ambient C0 \u2212quasigeodesic without\nh\nf \u2282 E(M\nf, K\u2032 ) joining Fe(a), Fe (b). Let \u03b2ea = \u03b2ea\nf be the part\nbacktracking in M\n\\ \u2202M\nh\nf\nof \u03b2ea lying away from the (bi-Lipschitz) horospherical boundary of M .\nThen dM (\u03b2ea , Fe(o)) \u2265 n implies that dH3 (\u03bbhthick , o) \u2265 \u0398(n).\nThis will be useful in [Mj10b]\n\n8.3. Local Connectivity of Connected Limit Sets. Here we shall use a Theorem of Anderson and Maskit [AM96] along with Theorems 7.1 and 8.6 above to\nprove that connected limit sets are locally connected. The connection between\nTheorems 7.1 and 8.6 and Theorem 8.9 below via Theorem 8.8 is similar to one\ndiscussed by Bowditch in [Bow07].\nTheorem 8.8. (Anderson-Maskit [AM96]) Let \u0393 be an analytically finite Kleinian\ngroup with connected limit set. Then the limit set \u039b(\u0393) is locally connected if and\nonly if every simply degenerate surface subgroup of \u0393 without accidental parabolics\nhas locally connected limit set.\nCombining Theorems 7.1 and 8.6 with Theorem 8.8, we have the following affirmative answer to Question 1.3.\nTheorem 8.9. Let \u0393 be a finitely generated Kleinian group with connected limit\nset \u039b. Then \u039b is locally connected.\nNote that \u039b is connected if and only if the convex core of H3 /\u0393 is incompressible\naway from cusps. In [Mj07], we prove that for surface groups without accidental\nparabolics, the point pre-images of the Cannon-Thurston map for points having\n\n\fCANNON-THURSTON MAPS FOR SURFACE GROUPS\n\n65\n\nmultiple pre-images are precisely the end-points of leaves of the ending lamination.\nIn [Mj10b] we shall use the techniques developed in this paper to answer Question\n1.1 affirmatively.\nReferences\n[Abi76]\n[ADP99]\n[Ago04]\n[AM96]\n[BB04]\n[BCM12]\n\n[Bie]\n[Bon86]\n[Bow97]\n[Bow02]\n[Bow05]\n[Bow07]\n[BS06]\n[Can93]\n[Can96]\n[CD02]\n[CD06]\n\n[CDP90]\n[CM96]\n[CT85]\n[CT07]\n[DM10]\n[Fan99a]\n[Fan99b]\n[Far98]\n[Flo80]\n[GdlH90]\n\nW.
