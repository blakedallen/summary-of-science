Are multiple transport mechanisms or a single one operating and are\nthese mechanisms fundamentally new or known already in non-molecular systems? Experimental results are often analyzed in terms of multiple mechanisms, and it is crucial to\nestablish if this is justified or if, in doing so, new mechanisms are ignored. The situation\nis complicated by the strong dependence of the current through the molecular junction on\nthe nature of the chemical bond to the electrodes.1-4 Molecules, chemically bound to the\nsemiconductor, are likely to affect the energy and density of surface states and, therefore,\nthe semiconductor band bending.5 Furthermore, the presence of a dipolar layer at the\nsemiconductor/metal interface can affect the barrier for electron transport inside the semiconductor.6, 7\nWe show here that two mechanisms for electron transport occur in n-Si/alkyl\nmonolayer/Hg junctions, where the molecules are bound via covalent Si-C bonds to Si.\nThe two mechanisms are unambiguously distinguished and identified, as each dominates\nin a different range of applied voltage. We chose this semiconductor/molecule/metal system to optimize the possibility of observing current transport over the semiconductor/metal barrier and tunneling through the insulating organic monolayer barrier. There\nare several key features of the experimental system that allow one to carry out the desired\nexperiments of current transport through molecules. First, the absence of an oxide between Si and the alkyl chain allows the direct study of the electrical properties of the\nmonolayer itself. Second, Si presents a very smooth, reproducible, and well-controlled\nsolid surface.8, 9 Third, well-prepared Si-C bonded alkyl monolayers are very stable.10 and\nsuitably long alkyl chains form well-organized, nearly pinhole-free monolayers.10, 11, 12 .\n\n2\n\n\fFourth, the use of a metallic liquid Hg contact decreases the probability of formation of\nshorts in any remaining pinhole because of the high surface tension of liquid Hg.13-15 Finally, the highly covalent Si-C bond, unlike the metal-thiolate bond, is a natural continuation of the alkyl chain. This feature minimizes potential discontinuities at the contacts.2,\n16\n\n. The choice of Si as electrode also makes the system relevant to Si-based microelec-\n\ntronics.\nBased on earlier data, we know that binding alkyl molecules to n-Si makes the ohmic,\nmolecule-free, n-Si:H/Hg contact rectifying.17, 18 Assuming that (i) rectification is due to\na Schottky-type metal/semiconductor barrier; and (ii) tunneling across the alkyl\nmonolayer is so efficient that it does not limit the current at low applied voltage, where\nthe Schottky barrier inside the semiconductor is still large, tunneling becomes the limiting step as the barrier decreases with increasing forward bias.19 We test these assumptions by measuring and analyzing J-V curves as function of temperature, using long chain\nalkyl molecules with different chain lengths in n-Si/alkyl monolayer/Hg junctions.\nSi-C linked alkyl monolayers were formed by thermally induced hydrosilylation of alkenes with Si:H, adapting a procedure described elsewhere.11, 20 Si(111) substrates (1-10\n\u03a9.cm) were rinsed with organic solvents, blown dry under argon, cleaned in piranha solution (conc. H2SO4 : 30% H2O2, 3:1 v/v) at 90oC for at least 20 min and rinsed with DI\nwater (this procedure is essential to get high-quality monolayers, needed for reproducible\nelectrical measurements). Samples were H-terminated by etching in 40% deoxygenated\nNH4F solution for 15\u201320 min. The resulting Si:H surfaces were immersed in the deoxygenated neat alkene under inert atmosphere and heated to 200 \u00b0C for at least 4 hr. Control\nsamples of monolayers on Si were characterized by AFM, advancing water contact angle\n\n3\n\n\f(CA), multi-wavelength, variable angle ellipsometry, Kelvin probe, X-ray Photoelectron\nSpectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray reflectivity. Empirically, we find the CA to be the simplest, fastest and most reliable way to assess monolayer quality, i.e., highest (lowest) current densities are observed for junctions with lowest(highest) CA values.21 Only\nmonolayers with CA >105\u00b0 were used for electrical measurements. Si-C linked molecular\nmonolayers on Si were further analyzed by UV and inverse photoemission spectroscopy\n(UPS, IPES) to determine the position of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied\nmolecular orbitals (HOMO, LUMO) after monolayer formation. These measurements\nwere followed by XPS measurements to assess any electron beam damage. Separate XPS\nmeasurements served to estimate band bending. The minor traces of O, found by analyzing the C1s, O1s and Si 2p core levels, were identified, based on the energies of these\nlevels, as adventitious O2 adsorbed on the monolayer's outside, i.e., oxide build-up at the\nSi-monolayer interface is insignificant, even on samples exposed to air for weeks.\nIn Fig. 1 we show the log(J)\u2013V characteristics of the series of n-Si/alkyl\nmonolayer/Hg junctions.22 Their shape clearly differs from earlier results on current\ntransport through Si/alkyl chains /Hg junctions, which were described by thermionic\nemission with tunneling correction, without distinction between the mechanisms.18, 2325\n\nWhile at low bias the log(J)-V curves for our n-Si-CnH2n+1//Hg (n=12, 14, 16, 18)\n\njunctions are well-described by transport over a Schottky barrier, at higher forward\nbias (>0.6 V) there is a clear transition to a regime best described by tunneling,26 i.e.,\nthere are two distinct types of barriers for current transport in the system. At low forward biases where current is limited by transport over the barrier inside the Si, the data\nclearly show that neither monolayer thickness nor molecular length play a discernible\n\n4\n\n\frole in charge transport. However, at higher forward bias, the observed current depends on molecular length, as expected for tunneling.27,\n\n28\n\nSuch a transition agrees\n\nwith simulations by Shewchun et al. for a similar system, with a transparent conductor\ninstead of Hg and SiOx as insulator with varying thickness.29, 30 Their simulations also\nshow that the insulating layer thickness dictates in how far the J-V characteristics deviate from those expected for transport over a Schottky barrier. Indeed, we find that\nthe thicker the monolayer, the lower the voltage at which the current becomes tunneling-limited (cf. Fig. 1). Remarkably, the theoretically predicted behavior was difficult\nto observe with insulating Si oxide films,31, 32 as we could confirm for Hg/SiOx/n-Si\njunctions.33 The reason is that the density of mobile charges in the oxide also scales\nwith oxide thickness, a complication that is not encountered in the oxide-free system\ninvestigated here, in which the insulator is a molecular monolayer.34, 35\n\nFigure 1: Experimental J-V curves for n-Si-CnH2n+1//Hg (n=12, 14, 16, 18) junctions\nat forward bias. Dashed line: n-Si:H//H29C14-S-Hg junction. Contact area: 0.1 mm2.\nCurves are the average for ~ 20 junctions. The error is 10%. Inset: Temperature\ndependence of I-V curves for n-Si-C14H29//Hg over the same voltage span.36, 37\n\n5\n\n\fThe interpretation of the room temperature J-V characteristics was checked by\ntemperature-dependent I-V measurements. Since Hg solidifies at ~235K, measurements were done from 250K up, with a high temperature limit of 330K because of experimental limitations and toxicity of Hg vapors. We find that, at low voltage, the current increases exponentially with temperature, as expected for current transport over a\nSchottky barrier.36 At high voltages the current even decreases slightly with increasing\ntemperature (inset Fig. 1). We attribute this to a change in molecular tilt angle with\ntemperature, as predicted by computations.37, 38\nThe behavior of the n-Si-CnH2n+1//Hg systems can be compared to that of the similar oxide-free n-Si:H//H2n+1Cn-S-Hg one (Fig. 1, dashed line), where the chains are\nchemically bound to Hg via the Hg-S bond and detached from the Si electrode, rather\nthan chemically bound to the Si and detached from the Hg, as n-Si-C14H29//Hg.23 As\nthe n-Si:H//H29C14-S-Hg system has a negligible Schottky barrier inside the semiconductor,39 current through that junction is limited by tunneling only. Indeed, at low\nvoltages the current through the n-Si:H//H29C14-S-Hg junction is several orders of\nmagnitudes higher than that through the n-Si-C14H29//Hg junction, where the current is\nlimited by thermionic emission over the barrier inside the semiconductor. However, at\nhigher voltages where charge transport is limited in both junctions by tunneling, the\ntwo J-V curves converge.\nFrom the experimental data we can extract separately the barrier inside the semiconductor, \u03c6b, and the barrier for tunneling through the molecular layer, \u03c6t. \u03c6b is calculated using the thermionic emission, or the more general thermionic emission-diffusion\n\n6\n\n\fmodel.36 In all cases, at room temperature and for applied bias, V> ~75 mV the following holds:\n\nJ \u221d exp(\u2212\n\nq(n\u03c6b \u2212 V )\n)\nnkT\n\n(1)\n\nwhere J is the measured current density, q is the electron charge, and k is Boltzmann's\nconstant.23 From the slope of the ln(J) - V plot, we find the ideality factor n ~1.5 and\nfrom the intercept of this plot, \u03c6b ~ 0.8 V. As the effective barrier, (n\u03c6b - V), decreases\nwith increasing V, the effect of \u03c6b decreases and tunneling through the organic molecular layer becomes the limiting factor.\nTo describe the current in the tunneling-limited regime, we use Simmons' model\nfor tunneling through a rectangular barrier, where the observed current depends exponentially on d, the tunneling distance, and on \u03b2 , the inverse tunneling decay length: 27,\n28\n\n\u2212 \u03b2d\n\nJ = Jo e\n\n(2)\n\nFor a rectangular barrier, \u03b2 is expected to depend on applied voltage according to:27, 28\n\n\u03b2 = 4\u03c0\n\n2m*(\u03c6 t \u2212\nh2\n\nqV\n)\n2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere m* is the electron effective mass and h is the Plank constant. From equation (3), \u03b2\nshould decrease as V increases. While experimentally no dependence40 or an opposite one\nis often found,23 the system studied here shows the expected dependence, as illustrated by\nthe linear \u03b22 - V plot in Fig.2.\nSuch dependence was also reported for alkyl monolayers attached on one side to nmsized Au contacts.41 By extrapolating the \u03b22 - V plot to V=0, we can evaluate \u03c6t and m*\n7\n\n\ffor tunneling through the molecular insulator. The slope of the \u03b22 - V plot yields m*\n=0.25\u00b10.2 me, similar to some experimental results and theoretical calculations.41-43 With\nthis value and the \u03b22 - V plot intercept, we find \u03c6t = 1.5\u00b10.5 eV. We stress that these \u03c6t\nand m* values are not absolute ones because of uncertainties regarding barrier shape and\njunction symmetry, factors that are included in m* in the theoretical model.41\n\n2\n\n0.5\n\n0.3\n\n2\n\n-2\n\nBeta [A ]\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\nBias [V]\n\n1.0\n\n:\n\nFigure 2: \u03b22 vs. forward bias at high voltages, derived from the data shown in\nFig. 1 and equations (2) and (3). The solid line shows the best linear fit.\n\nTo extract absolute values for \u03c6t and m* we need an independent measurement of\none of these quantities. The barrier height for electron transport through the LUMO\nwas obtained from IPES measurements44 on the n-Si-C14 and n-Si-C16 systems.\nThese show the LUMO at 2.2\u00b10.3 eV above the Fermi level (EF), yielding a tunneling\nbarrier between the conduction band edge (ECB) and the LUMO36 of ~1.4\u00b10.3 eV, after taking into account that the Schottky barrier, ECB - EF (=\u03c6b) is ~0.8 eV. The 1.4 eV\nvalue is in good agreement with \u03c6t derived from the transport data. We note that the\nlow m* (=0.25me) implies that the effective barrier for tunneling is much lower than \u03c6t.\n\n8\n\n\fThe band diagram for the n-Si-CnH2n+1//Hg system is constructed with the LUMO\nposition given above, the Schottky barrier found from the I-V measurements, and a 1.1\neV Si band gap (Fig. 3). The HOMO position, determined by UPS, is 3.2 \u00b10.3 eV below the Fermi level, or 2.9\u00b10.3 eV below the valence band edge (ECB - EF \u2245 0.8 eV).\nThe HOMO-LUMO gap is then estimated at 5.4 \u00b1 0.5 eV, significantly less than the 9\n- 10 eV free alkyl chain value.42 The reduction in ionization energy and increase in\nelectron affinity for the condensed molecule is, to a great extent, due to stabilizing effect of electronic polarization in the metal or dielectric substrate and in the molecular\nlayer45. Furthermore, in a molecular orbital picture, chemical bond formation between\nthe Si surface and the free molecules involves new orbitals for the (Si+molecule) system, resulting from interactions between the molecule frontier orbitals and the semiconductor surface state levels (cf. ref.5), leading to a HOMO-LUMO gap of the\n(Si+molecule) system that is smaller than that of the free molecule. The HOMO level\nwill be mainly localized on the Si-C bond part of the system.\nIn summary, our results show that two distinct electron transport mechanisms operate in the n-Si-CnH2n+1//Hg molecular system. At low forward bias voltages, current\nis limited by transport over a Schottky barrier in the semiconductor. At higher forward\nbias current is limited by tunneling through the organic molecular layer. The thinner\nthe molecular layer, the higher the voltage at which the tunnel current starts to dominate.46, 47\nThe molecules in the n-Si-CnH2n+1//Hg junction are more ideally insulating than\nnative Si oxide. This may be of interest, for example, in solar cell applications.30 By\nusing more sophisticated molecules and combining the alkyl chain framework with di-\n\n9\n\n\fpolar molecules,6 it should be possible to achieve molecular control over both transport via tunneling and transport over the barrier in the system.\n\nEvac\n\n4.3\n\n4.5\nLUMO\n1.4\n\nECB\nEF\n\n0.8\n\n5.4\n\n1.1\n\nEVB\n\nn- Si\nn- Si\n\n2.9\n\nHg\n\nHOMO\n\nFigure 3: Proposed band diagram for the n-Si-C14H29//Hg system from UPS,\nIPES, and J-V data.

From UPS and XPS we find ~ 0.4 eV band bending before making Hg\ncontact. The ~0.8 eV Schottky barrier implies that band bending increases to ~0.5\neV. As the LUMO was found to be ~2.2\u00b10.3 eV above EF, it is 1.4\u00b10.3 eV above\nthe Si ECB.\n\n10\n\n\fAcknowledgements.\n\nWe thank L. Kronik (WIS) and Y. Selzer & A.
