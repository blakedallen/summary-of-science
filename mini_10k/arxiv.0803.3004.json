Introduction\nUnderstanding the influence of the environment onto the non-equilibrium dynamics of\nquantum systems remains one of the challenging questions of theoretical physics. A\nfinite number of quantum mechanical degrees of freedom \u2013 an orbit, a spin or a qubit\n\u2013 interacting with a infinitely large bath of non-interacting bosons or fermions with\na continuous energy spectrum, represents a typical class of model examples for such\nsystems.\nThese quantum impurity models appear to be at heart of a variety of different\nphysical problems. Traditionally, they were used to describe the interaction of magnetic\nimpurities within a metallic host[1] or to investigate the dissipation in quantum\nmechanics[2]. These models have contributed immensely to our understanding of\nthe low temperature properties of single-electron transistors[3, 4] and the tunneling\nspectroscopy of adatoms on metal surfaces.[5, 6] In addition, within the dynamical\nmean-field theory[7, 8] or its cluster extensions[9] lattice models for strongly correlated\nfermions have been mapped onto quantum impurity problems embedded in a fictitious,\nself-consistent bath.\nMany approaches to non-equilibrium are based on the Kadanoff-Baym [10] and\nKeldysh [11] techniques. At some time t0 = 0 a closed system characterized by a\ndensity operator \u03c1\u03020 evolves according to the Hamiltonian H(t). The immense difficulty\nof treating the real-time dynamics of quantum impurity systems stems from the need to\ntrack the full time evolution of the density operator of the entire system - environment\nplus impurity. The Kadanoff-Baym and Keldysh techniques [11, 10] provide an elegant\nplatform for perturbative expansions of the density operator. One of the building\nblocks of such perturbative expansions are non-equilibrium Green functions. These\nnon-equilibrium Green functions also contain information on the transients as well as\nthe steady-state which might be reached in the long time limit for a time-independent\nHamiltonian. In general, however, perturbative approaches are plagued by the infrared divergences caused by degeneracies on the impurity, making them inadequate for\ntackling the change of ground states of quantum impurity models[12].\nIn this paper, we present a different approach for the calculation of nonequilibrium Green functions of quantum impurity problems. We make use of Wilson's\nnumerical renormalization-group (NRG) method[12, 13] and its recent extension to nonequilibrium dynamics[14, 15]. Spin-spin non-equilibrium spectral functions obtained by\na NRG calculations were investigated first by Costi about ten years ago in the context of\nthe spin-boson model[16]. Here, we are interested in the evolution of fermionic spectral\nfunctions. We address this problem with a different approach using the complete basis\nset of the Wilson chain [12, 13] derived in the context of the time-dependent numerical\nrenormalization group [14, 15] (TD-NRG). It has already been successfully applied to\nderive sum-rule conserving equilibrium Green functions[17, 18].\nWe focus on a quantum impurity system characterized by the thermodynamic\ndensity operator \u03c1\u03020 \u221d exp(\u2212\u03b2Hi ) for times t\u2032 < 0. It evolves with respect to the\n\n\fNon-Equilibrium Green's Functions for Quantum Impurity Models\n\n3\n\nHamiltonian Hf for times t\u2032 \u2265 0. We will derive a closed analytical formula for any nonequilibrium Green function G(t, t\u2032 ) for times t, t\u2032 > 0 given a time-independent Hf . In\ncontrary to the equilibrium Green functions,[18, 17] transitions between different energy\nshells require a double summation over pairs of Wilson shells (m, m\u2032 ). In Sec. 2.2, we\nprove that this summation can be casted into a recursion relation involving two different\nreduced-density matrices instead of the single one used in the algorithm for equilibrium\nGreen functions[18, 17]. It can be seen analytically that only one of these two reduceddensity matrices contributes if Hi = Hf : the equilibrium algorithm[18] is recovered.\nTherefore, the presented approach to non-equilibrium spectral functions embeds the\nequilibrium case[18, 17] as well.\nWe will heavily make use of this algorithm in another publication [19] on the\ncurrent-voltage characteristics of interacting nano-devices. In that paper, we will derive\na numerical renormalization group approach based on scattering states to describe\ncurrent-carrying open quantum systems. In this formulation, the current at finite bias is\ndetermined by the steady-state non-equilibrium (NEQ) spectral function[20, 21, 22, 23]\nwhich depends on the density operator of the full system. At finite bias, however, the\nNEQ density operator is only known analytically for Hamiltonians which commute with\nthe number operator of left and right-moving electrons,[21, 24] i.e. for non-interacting\nquantum impurities. This analytically known operator \u03c1\u03020 must be evolved into the\nunknown NEQ density operator \u03c1\u0302 after switching on a finite Coulomb repulsion U.\nWe have used the single impurity Anderson model (SIAM)[25, 26] for benchmarking\nour algorithm. We have restricted ourselves to changes of local parameters of the\nquantum impurity at t0 = 0. Consequently, the system has evolved with respect to\nthe full Hamiltonian Hf . For an infinitely large bath, it is expected[10, 11, 24] that the\ninitial \u03c1\u03020 \u221d exp(\u2212\u03b2Hi ) evolved into the new thermodynamic density operator of the\nfully interacting problem described by Hf for times t \u2192 \u221e, unless it is prohibited by\nsome conservation law[24]. This is the basic underlying assumption of the perturbation\ntheory in the Coulomb interaction U[27, 28, 29]. Therefore, the steady-state spectral\nfunction obtained from a time-evolved density operator should be equivalent to the\nspectra obtained directly by an equilibrium NRG calculation[25, 26, 18, 17].\nWe will use this comparison between both spectra as benchmark for our algorithm\nin Sec. 3. We will demonstrate excellent agreement between these differently calculated\nspectral functions for switching on the local Coulomb repulsion U from U = 0 to a finite\nvalue at various temperatures and local magnetic fields.\n2. Theory\nInteracting quantum dots, molecular junctions or other nano-devices are modelled by\nthe interacting region Himp , a set of non-interacting reservoirs Hbath and a coupling\nbetween both sub-systems HI\nH = Himp + Hbath + HI .\n\n(1)\n\n\fNon-Equilibrium Green's Functions for Quantum Impurity Models\n\n4\n\nWe assume that the system is in equilibrium at times t < 0, and its properties\nare determined by the density operator \u03c1\u03020 . One possible choice would be HI = 0,\nwhich is usually the starting point of perturbative approaches based on the Keldysh\nformalism[11]. However, this is not required by our method. We only demand that the\ninitial density operator can be cast in the form \u03c1\u03020 = exp(\u2212\u03b2Hi )/Z, where Hi can be\nthe initial Hamiltonian of the system in thermodynamic equilibrium for times t < 0.\nAt t0 = 0, we suddenly switch from the Hamiltonian H = Hi to H = Hf . The\nretarded two-time Green function,\nh\ni\nGrA,B (t, t\u2032 ) = \u2212 iTr \u03c1\u03020 [\u00c2(t + t\u2032 ), B\u0302(t\u2032 )]s \u0398(t)\nh\ni\n\u2032\n= \u2212 iTr \u03c1\u03020 (t )[\u00c2(t), B\u0302]s \u0398(t),\n(2)\ncontains information on the correlated dynamics of two operators \u00c2 and B\u0302, where\nf\n\nft\n\n\u03c1\u0302(t) = e\u2212iH t \u03c1\u03020 eiH\niHf t\n\n\u00d4(t) = e\n\n\u2212iHf t\n\nOe\n\n(3)\n.\n\n(4)\n\nFor fermionic operators the anti-commutator is used for [\u00c2(t), B\u0302]s while for Bosonic\noperators [\u00c2(t), B\u0302]s represents a commutator. Eq. (2) indicates that we can interpret\nsuch a two-time Green function as evolving the density operator of the system from \u03c4 = 0\nto the time \u03c4 = t\u2032 , and calculating the correlation function of B\u0302 and \u00c2 with respect\nto the relative time t > 0. We expect that when changes are restricted to the local\npart of the Hamiltonian, i. e. Himp + HI , a steady-state or even a new thermodynamic\nequilibrium [10, 11, 21, 24] is reached for times larger than the largest characteristic\ntime-scale of the system. In these cases, the limit\n\u03c1\u0302\u221e = \u2032lim \u03c1\u0302(t\u2032 )\nt \u2192\u221e\n\n(5)\n\nexists. Eq (2) becomes independent of t\u2032 , and G(t, t\u2032 ) only depends of the relative time\nt in the steady-state limit.\n2.1. Complete Basis Set\nWilson's numerical renormalization group (NRG) method is a very powerful tool for\naccurately calculating equilibrium properties of quantum impurity models. Originally\ndeveloped for treating the single-channel, single-impurity Kondo Hamiltonian[30, 12],\nthis non-perturbative approach was successfully extended to the Anderson impurity\nmodel[25, 26], and to the two-channel Anderson[31] and Kondo Hamiltonians[32, 33].\nRecently, it was extended to equilibrium properties of impurity models with a bosonic\nbath [34, 35], non-equilibrium dynamics of the spin-boson model [15, 36] or even\ncombinations of both fermionic and Bosonic baths[37].\nAt the heart of this approach is a logarithmic discretization of the continuous bath,\ncontrolled by the discretization parameter \u039b > 1; the continuum limit is recovered for\n\u039b \u2192 1. Using an appropriate unitary transformation,[12] the Hamiltonian is mapped\nonto a semi-infinite chain, defined by a sequence of finite-size Hamiltonians Hm with\n\n\fNon-Equilibrium Green's Functions for Quantum Impurity Models\n\n5\n\nthe impurity coupled to the open end. The iterations are terminated at a finite value of\nm = N which defines the Wilson chain of finite length N. The finite-size Hamiltonian\nHm act only on the first m chain links of the Wilson chain. The length N also determines\nthe temperature TN \u221d \u039b\u2212N/2 for which the spectral functions are calculated. For a\ndetailed review on this method see Ref. [13].\nRecently, a complete basis set for such a Wilson chain of length N has been\nidentified[14, 15]. The set of eigenstates of Hm can be formally constructed from the\ncomplete basis set {|\u03b1imp , \u03b10 , * * * , \u03b1N i} of the NRG chain of length N where the \u03b1i\nlabel the configurations on each chain link i. Since Hm does not act on the chain\nlinks m + 1, * * * , N, an eigenstate |ri is written as |r, e; mi where the \"environment\"\nvariable e = {\u03b1m+1 , * * * , \u03b1N } encodes the N \u2212 m site labels \u03b1m+1 , * * * , \u03b1N . The index\nm is used in this notation to record where the chain is partitioned into a \"subsystem\"\nand an \"environment\". After each iteration the eigenstates of Hm states are divided in\n\"discarded\" and Ns \"kept\" states. The standard NRG proceeds to next iteration m + 1\nusing only the kept states. It was proven [14, 15] that the discarded states from all NRG\niterations, i.e {|l, e; midis } also form a complete basis set. Regarding all eigenstates of\nthe final NRG iteration as discarded, one can formally write the Fock space of the N-site\nchain in the form FN = span{|l, e; midis }, and the following completeness relation holds:\nN\nX\nX\n\nm=mmin l,e\n\n|l, e; midis\n\ndis hl, e; m|\n\n=1.\n\n(6)\n\nHere the summation over m starts from the first iteration mmin at which a basis-set\nreduction is imposed. All traces below will be carried out with respect to this basis set.\nHence, the evaluation of the spectral functions will not involve any truncation error.\nNote also that we made no reference to a particular Hamiltonian H in constructing the\nbasis set {|l, e; midis }.\nAt each iteration m, the Fock space FN of a Wilson chain with fixed length N is\npartitioned by all previously discarded states\n1\u2212\nm\n\n=\n\nm\u22121\nX\n\nX\n\nm\u2032 =mmin l\u2032 ,e\u2032\n\n|l\u2032 , e\u2032 ; m\u2032 idis\n\ndis hl\n\n\u2032\n\n, e\u2032 ; m\u2032 | ,\n\n(7)\n\nand all states present r at iteration m\n1+\nm =\n\nN X\nX\n\nm\u2032 =m l\u2032 ,e\u2032\n\n=\n\nX\nr,e\n\n|l\u2032 , e\u2032 ; m\u2032 idis\n\ndis hl\n\n\u2032\n\n, e\u2032 ; m\u2032 | .\n\n|r, e; mihr, e; m| .\n\n(8)\n\nWe will make extensive use of the completeness relation\n+\n1 = 1\u2212\nm + 1m\n\nin the following section.\n\n(9)\n\n\fNon-Equilibrium Green's Functions for Quantum Impurity Models\n\n6\n\n2.2. Derivation of the NRG non-equilibrium Green function\nFor the moment, we will consider\nonly the\nh\ni first term of the commutator of the retarded\nGreen function I(t\u2032 , t) = Tr \u03c1\u0302(t\u2032 )\u00c2(t)B\u0302 . If the operator \u00d4t = \u00c2(t)B\u0302 were a \"local\"\noperator, i.e. an operator which only acts on impurity degrees of freedom or a Wilson\nchain of length mmin up to which all states are still maintained,\nwe\nh\ni could use the TD\u2032\n\u2032\nNRG[14, 15] to calculate the time evolution of Ot (t ) = Tr \u03c1\u0302(t )\u00d4t .\n\nIn general, the time evolution of a local operator \u00d4 leads to an operator \u00d4t which\nacts on all chain degrees of freedom. Each operator \u00d4t can always be expanded in\nouter products of all many-body states spanning the Fock-space. Here, we will restrict\nourselves always to a many-body Fock-space basis which is an approximate eigenbasis of\nthe Wilson chain Hamiltonian. For the application of the TD-NRG, we require that the\nmatrix elements of \u00d4t remain diagonal in and independent of the environment degrees\nof freedom e, e\u2032\nm\n(t) .\nhr, e; m|\u00d4t |s, e\u2032; mi = \u03b4e,e\u2032 Ors\n\n(10)\n\nThen the operator qualifies as local operator as defined in Eqn.

(8). The locality of the\noperators \u00c2 and B\u0302 has been used and leads to the condition e1 = e2 . Since m\u2032\u2032 < m, we\n\n\f7\n\nNon-Equilibrium Green's Functions for Quantum Impurity Models\n\ncan partition the environment degrees of freedom e1 into e1 = (\u1ebd1 , e\u20321 ) where e\u20321 labels\nthe Wilson chain degree of freedom starting from chain link m + 1.

(10) holds, and the matrix elements in Eq.(12) are independent of e.\nConsequently, the operator \u00d4t = \u00c2(t)B\u0302 qualifies as a local operator in the sense of\nthe TD-NRG[14, 15] for each time t, and I(t\u2032 , t) is given by the fundamental equation\nof the TD-NRG, Eq.

At each time t\u2032 , the spectral information is encoded\nin the time evolution of \u00d4(t).\nInserting Eq. (11) into Eq. (13) yields two terms.

By construction, \u03c1\u0303k\u2032 ,k\u2032\u2032 (m + 1, t) has only non-zero\nmatrix elements for k \u2032 and k \u2032\u2032 being both retained states of the NRG iteration m + 1.\nThe restricted sum over r and s projects out the other sectors of the matrix\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03c1r,s (t\u2032 ) = \u03c1red\ns,r (m + 1, t ) + \u03c1\u0303s,r (m + 1, t ) for which at least one of the indices s, r labels\na discarded state.

Note that the index l labels\nall discarded states at iteration m. Obviously, the same type of calculation must also\nbe performed for the second term of the commutator in Eq. (2) in order to obtain all\ncontributions for the Green function. Fourier transformation of Eq. (23) with respect\nto t yields the spectral information of interest.\nIt has to be emphasized that only energetic approximations have been made. The\nNRG truncation influences the partitioning of the states, but the completeness of the\nbasis is always guaranteed[14, 15]. Therefore, the spectral sum-rule remains fulfilled\nexactly for each time t\u2032 as in the equilibrium case[18]. It is straight forward to apply\nour algorithm also to the lesser and greater Green functions G< (t, t\u2032 ) and G> (t, t\u2032 ) as\ndiscussed in Ref. [17].\n2.3. Steady-state limit\nFor all systems in which a time-independent steady-state density operator \u03c1\u0302\u221e is reached,\nEq.

(23) as well as in the recursion relation (21), the reduced density\nmatrix \u03c1red\ns,r (m) contributes only energy diagonal matrix elements. In general, however,\nthe reduced density matrix \u03c1\u0303red\nk,k \u2032 will not be diagonal in the NRG eigenbasis.\nWe introduce the integral LA,B (t\u2032 ) of the Fourier transformed Green function\nGrA,B (\u03c9, t\u2032 ) with respect to t as\nZ \u221e\nd\u03c9\n\u2032\nLA,B (t ) = \u2212\nImGrA,B (\u03c9, t\u2032 ) .\n(27)\n\u03c0\n\u2212\u221e\nFor operators \u00c2 and B\u0302, whose anti-commutator \u2013 commutator for bosonic operators \u2013\nremains constant, LA,B (t\u2032 ) defines a sum-rule independent of t\u2032 which is fulfilled exactly\nby our approach at any time t\u2032 due to the usage of a complete basis set. Therefore, the\naveraged sum-rule\nZ\nZ \u221e\n1 T\nd\u03c9\n\u2032\nd\u03c4\nImGrA,B (\u03c9, \u03c4 )\n(28)\nLA,B = \u2032lim LA,B (t ) = \u2212 lim\nT \u2192\u221e T 0\nt \u2192\u221e\n\u2212\u221e \u03c0\n\nremain exacty fullfilled as well. An example would be the single-particle spectral\nfunction obtained from Eq. (23) by setting A = f\u03c3 and B = f\u03c3\u2020 . In this case\nLf\u03c3 ,f\u03c3\u2020 (t\u2032 ) = 1. In fact, we use this criterion to check explicitly the sum-rule conservation\nand found that it remains always within machine precision with an error of 10\u221215\nindependent of all parameters.\nA word is in order about the usage of the term \"steady-state.\" We expect that\na steady-state is always reached at long times for a time independent Hamiltonian[24]\nHf in quantum impurity systems. In a closed but infinite quantum system, where only\nHimp + HI has been changed, the steady-state will be identical to the thermodynamic\nequilibrium described by the density operator \u03c1\u0302 = exp(\u2212\u03b2Hf )/Zf , in the sense that all\nlocal expectation values calculated with \u03c1\u221e and \u03c1\u0302 will be the same. It requires that the\nlimit limt\u2032 \u2192\u221e limV \u2192\u221e is taken such that t\u2032 \u226a V in appropriate dimensionless units.\nA steady-state rather than a thermodynamic equilibrium[21, 24] will be reached\nfor an open quantum system in the limit t\u2032 \u2192 \u221e [21, 24] at finite bias. Again, it\nrequires that the limit limt\u2032 \u2192\u221e limV \u2192\u221e is taken in the correct order. However, within a\ndiscretized representation of such a quantum impurity system, we can never distinguish\nbetween the approach to a true thermodynamic equilibrium and non-equilibrium steadystate for times t\u2032 \u2192 \u221e. Therefore, we will always use the term \"steady-state\"\nthroughout the paper even for situations where it can be proven that the corresponding\ncontinuum limit of the model approaches the thermodynamic limit for infinitely long\ntimes[24]. In fact, the difference between our steady-state and equilibrium spectral\nfunction will serve as a criterion for the quality of our approach.\n\n\fNon-Equilibrium Green's Functions for Quantum Impurity Models\n\n11\n\n2.4. Recovering the sum-rule conserving equilibrium NRG Green function\nEquation (23) must contain all contributions to the equilibrium Green function [17, 18]\nas well. In equilibrium, the initial and final Hamiltonian are identical (H = Hi = Hf ),\nthe density operator \u03c1\u03020 commutes with H. The overlap matrix Sr,s between eigenstates\nof Hi and Hf , Sr,s = i hs; m|r, mif must be diagonal. Then, I1 contributes with an\nenergy diagonal \u03c1red\ns,r (N) only on the last Wilson shell and is identical to Eq. (11) of\nRef. [18]. For m < N, \u03c1red\ns,r (N) has only non-zero matrix elements for r and s being\na kept state, which are explicitly excluded by the summation restriction. Therefore,\nred\n\u2032\n\u03c1red\ns,r (m) contributes only once to the reduced density matrix \u03c1\u0303k2 ,k1 (m, t ) in the recursion\nrelation Eq. (21), namely at iteration N \u2212 1. As a consequence, the reduced density\n\u2032\nmatrix \u03c1\u0303red\nk2 ,k1 (m, t ) becomes time independent in equilibrium and equal to the reduced\nred\n\u2032\nred\ndensity matrix \u03c1red\nk2 ,k1 (m), i.e. \u03c1\u0303k2 ,k1 (m, t ) = \u03c1k2 ,k1 (m). The Fourier transformation of\nI2 (t\u2032 = 0, t) with respect to t yields Eq. (16) of Ref. [18].\n2.5. The non-equilibrium NRG algorithm\nAs in the equilibrium NRG,[12] each chain length N corresponds to a temperature\nTN \u221d \u039b\u2212N/2 . For Hi and Hf , two simultaneous NRG runs are performed in order to\ngenerate the density operator \u03c1\u03020 using Hi and the eigenenergies of Hf for the time\nevolution. At each iteration m, we calculated the overlap matrix Sr,r\u2032 (m) between all\nf\ni\neigenstates r of Hm\nand all eigenstates r \u2032 of Hm\n[15]. This information, as well as the\nf\ni\nunitary matrices diagonalizing Hm and Hm are stored. At the end of the NRG runs,\nthe equilibrium density matrix [12, 13, 14, 15] is calculated using the last iteration of\nHNi :\n1 X \u2212\u03b2N ElN\ne\n|l; Nihl; N|\n(29)\n\u03c1\u03020 =\nZN l\nP\nwhere ZN = l exp(\u2212\u03b2N ElN ).\nWe have implemented the TD-NRG algorithm[15] recursively by going backwards\nfrom m to m \u2212 1. For each backward iteration, we perform the following steps:\ni\n(i) calculate the reduced density matrix in the basis of Hm\nusing using Eq. (40) in\nRef. [15]\n\n(ii) calculate \u03c1\u2032r,s (m + 1, t\u2032 ) according to Eq. (22)\n\u2032\n(iii) calculate \u03c1\u0303red\nr,s (m, t ) using the recursion Eq. (21)\n\u2032\nred\n(iv) combine \u03c1\u0303red\nr,s (m, t ) and \u03c1r,s (m + 1) to a single reduced density matrix\n\n(v) evaluate the contribution of iteration m to the excitation spectrum obtained by\nFourier transform Eq. (23)\n(vi) steps (i)-(v) are repeated until we reach the iteration mmin at which no state was\neliminated.\nWhile the selection of retained states in the NRG run for Hi is determined by the\ndensity matrix[12], the selection of states of Hf is guided by the notion of maximizing\n\n\fNon-Equilibrium Green's Functions for Quantum Impurity Models\n\n12\n\nthe overlap with the eigenstates of Hi . Amongst different truncation schemes, which\nwe have implemented, the simplest was the most effective[14, 15]. In this truncation\nf\nscheme, we selected the lowest eigenstates of Hm\nat the end of each iteration m as well.\nIn Ref. [19] the current through a nano-device coupled to two leads is investigated\nas function of the finite applied bias using the algorithm for NEQ spectral function\npresented here. The device is described by a two-band model. Each band representing\nthe bath continuum for either left or right-moving scattering states will be set to a\ndifferent chemical potential \u03bc\u03b1 , \u03b1 = L, R. The potential different V = \u03bcR \u2212 \u03bcL drives\na finite current through the nano-device. In this case, the NRG run for Hi obtains a\nfaithful many-body representation of the density operator of the non-interaction problem\n(U = 0)\ni\n\n\u03c10 \u221d e\u2212\u03b2(H \u2212\u01760 )\n\n(30)\n\nwhere operator[21]\n\u01760 =\n\nX\n\n\u03bc\u03b1 N\u03b1\n\n(31)\n\n\u03b1\n\nreplaces the usual number operator for a grand canonical ensemble in order to include\nthe different potentials \u03bc\u03b1 of the scattering states.\nf\nAfter each iteration for Hm\n, one would like to retain the states with the largest\ni\noverlap with the eigenstates of Hm\n. These eigenstates of Hf are generally expected to\nbe connected to the eigenstates of Hi of the same eigenenergy relative to the ground state\nby the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for a model with a continuous bath. In practice,\nf\nwe select those eigenstates of Hm\nwhich have the lowest diagonal matrix elements of\nf\nf\nthe operator Hm \u2212 \u01760 . Therefore, the eigenenergies Es of Hm\ncan be divided into two\ncontributions\nX\nEs = \u2206Es +\n\u03bc\u03b1 ns\u03b1 .\n(32)\n\u03b1\n\nThe first term \u2206Es is of the order \u039b\u2212m/2 due to the truncation scheme, and the second\nterm is defined by\nX\nX\nhs|\u01760|si =\n\u03bc\u03b1 ns\u03b1 =\n\u03bc\u03b1 hs|N\u0302\u03b1 |si .\n(33)\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\nThe question of the distribution and magnitude of the the excitation energies\n\u2206Ers = Erm \u2212 Esm entering Eq. (23) arises in order to understand the redistribution\nf\nof spectral weight at finite bias. \u2206Ers involves eigenenergies of Hm\nand is given by\nX\n\u2206Ers = \u2206Er \u2212 \u2206Es +\n\u03bc\u03b1 (nr\u03b1 \u2212 ns\u03b1 )\n(34)\n\u03b1\n\nThe single-particle spectral function is obtained from Eq. (23) by setting A = f\u03c3 and\nB = f\u03c3\u2020 . Only those states r and s can contribute to the spectral function whose total\nnumber of particles differs by exactly one electron, i.e.\nX\n(35)\n(nr\u03b1 \u2212 ns\u03b1 ) = \u00b1 1 .\n\u03b1\n\n\fNon-Equilibrium Green's Functions for Quantum Impurity Models\n\n13\n\nSubstituting Eq. (35) into (34) yields the two equivalent ways of writing the excitation\nenergies\n\u2206Ers = \u2206Er \u2212 \u2206Es + (\u03bcR \u2212 \u03bcL ) (nrR \u2212 nsR ) \u00b1 \u03bcL\n= \u2206Er \u2212 \u2206Es + (\u03bcL \u2212\n\n\u03bcR ) (nrL\n\n\u2212\n\nnsL )\n\n(36)\n\n\u00b1 \u03bcR .\n\n(37)\n\nFor models with a channel conservation law, | (nr\u03b1 \u2212 ns\u03b1 ) | = 0, 1 must hold. As\na consequence, the excitation energies \u2206Ers are centered around the two chemical\npotentials \u03bc\u03b1 . For interacting quantum impurity models which violate channel\nconservation[21, 19], the differences |\u2206N\u03b1rs | are given arbitrary numbers. By inserting\na finite value of (nr\u03b1 \u2212 ns\u03b1 ) into Eq. (36) or (37), it becomes apparent that the energy\ndifference \u2206Ers will be shifted away from either chemical potential by multiples of the\nchemical potential differences V = \u03bcL \u2212 \u03bcR [21, 19].\nA word is in order concerning the the frequency resolution. In the usual equilibrium\nNRG the lowest resolvable frequency[13] coincides with the temperature TN \u221d \u039b\u2212N/2\nset by the length of the Wilson chain. The non-equilibrium Green functions G(t, t\u2032 )\ndepends on two different times. The Fourier transformation with respect to relative time\nt remains meaningful even in the limit t\u2032 \u2192 \u221e, since the steady-state density operator\n\u03c1\u221e exists and is well defined by Eq. (24). However, the smallest excitation energy\nresolved might be larger than \u03c9N \u2248 \u039b\u2212N/2 due to the difference between \u03c1T\u221eD\u2212N RG\nobtained via Eq. (24) and the exact steady-state density operator for a bath continuum.\nDepending on the bias V and values of U the lower boundary for frequency resolution\nincreases to \u03c9low \u2248 \u039b\u2212m/2 which typically m = N \u2212 1 to m = N \u2212 3. In all cases, we\ninvestigated in Ref. [19], the bias V remains significantly larger that \u03c9low .\n3. Results\n3.1. The single impurity Anderson model\nIn order to demonstrate the potential of this approach, we will present results for the\nsingle-particle spectral functions of the single impurity Anderson model (SIAM) for\nwhich the equilibrium spectral functions are well studied [38, 39, 40, 13, 18] and can\nserve as benchmarks.\nThe Hamiltonian of the SIAM[41, 25, 26]\nX\n\u01ebk\u03c3 c\u2020k\u03c3 ck\u03c3 + Himp\nH\n=\nk\u03c3\n\n+V\n\nX\u0010\nk\u03c3\n\nc\u2020k\u03c3 f\u03c3 + f\u03c3\u2020 ck\u03c3\n\n\u0011\n\nHimp = H0 + HU\n\u0013\nX\u0012\n\u03c3\nU\nU\n=\n\u01ebf + \u2212 H f\u03c3\u2020 f\u03c3 +\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c3\n\u0011\nX\u0010\n\u03c3\n=\n\u01ebf \u2212 H f\u03c3\u2020 f\u03c3 + Unf\u2191 nf\u2193\n2\n\u03c3\n\n(38)\n\n(39)\nX\n\u03c3\n\nnf\u03c3 \u2212 1\n\n!2\n\n\f14\n\nNon-Equilibrium Green's Functions for Quantum Impurity Models\n!2\nU X f\nHU =\nn\u03c3 \u2212 1\n2\n\u03c3\n\n(40)\n\nconsists of a single local state, which we will denote with f , with energy \u01ebf and Coulomb\nrepulsion U, coupled to a bath of conduction electrons with creation operators c\u2020k\u03c3 and\nenergies \u01ebk\u03c3 . The local level is subject to a Zeeman splitting in an external magnetic field\nH. Note that the single-particle term of the impurity Hamiltonian Himp can be written\nin two different ways, i.e. the last two lines of Eq.

(39) \u2013 or non-interaction term containing the Hartree\ncontribution and a particle-hole preserving interaction term HU [25, 26].

In Fig. 1, the steady-state spectral functions for\na particle-hole symmetric regime are compared with the equilibrium solution obtained\ndirectly from the standard NRG procedure[18]. In these calculations, the Hartree term\nU/2 has been absorbed into Hi . At time t\u2032 = 0, the Coulomb interaction HU is switched\non. An excellent agreement between the equilibrium NRG result (dashed lines) and the\nlong-time limit of the time-evolved spectral functions (solid lines) is found. The noninteracting resonant-level spectral function centered around \u03c9 = 0 evolves continuously\ninto the Green function for a SIAM with finite U. The inset in Fig. 1 shows small\ndeviations between the reference equilibrium spectra for H = Hf and the steady-state\nspectra obtained from the Fourier-transform of Eq. (25) in the Kondo regime. Note\nthat the exponentially small Kondo scale not accessible to perturbation theories in U\nis always accounted for correctly within the NRG and, therefore, in our algorithm by\nthe crossover to the fixed-point spectrum of Hf [25, 26]. With increasing values of U\nand fixed \u039b, the peak height decreases from its theoretical unitary limit of 1/(\u03c0\u0393). The\ndeviations are less that 1% for U = 2 and increase to approximately 11% for U = 10.\nThe correct low-energy scale[25, 13] TK proportional to the width of the resonance at\n\u03c9 = 0 emerges as well in the steady-state spectral functions.\nWe investigated also the impact of the initial level position \u01ebif onto the steady-state\nspectra.

The steady-state spectral function are plotted as solid lines, while\nthe direct equilibrium calculation[18] yields the dashed lines for the same parameters.\nThe colors (color online) are identical for the same values of U .

Here, the Hartree term U/2 is not absorbed into the single-particle energy and\nthe Coulomb repulsion term HU = Unf\u2191 nf\u2193 is switched on at t\u2032 = 0.\nThe results for this starting point are presented in Fig. 2. The steady-state spectra\nshow an increasing deviation from the correct thermodynamic equilibrium spectrum\nwhich remains pinned at 1/\u03c0 for all values of U in accordance with the density\nof state sum rule[43, 44]. All steady-state spectra remain particle-hole symmetric,\nguarantied by Hf , and the high energy feature are well reproduced. However, we observe\ndeviations from the correct Abrikosov-Suhl resonance (ASR) already for moderate values\nof U > 2\u0393. For large values of U, the ASR is almost absent in the steady-state spectra.\nThe difference can be understood in the following way. By absorbing the Hartree\nterm into the initial Hamiltonian Hi , the average impurity occupation hnf i does not\nchange with time. Hi and Hf will flow to the same strong-coupling fixed point for\nT \u2192 0. The excellent agreement between the equilibrium reference spectrum and the\nsteady-state spectrum can be seen in Fig. 1.\nIn Fig. 2, however, we have started with a non-interacting Hamiltonian which breaks\nparticle-hole symmetry: the level position is located at \u01ebf = \u2212U/2. For increasing values\nof U/\u0393 > 1, it corresponds to a doubly occupied level as the starting configuration\nwhile the final spectra must be particle-hole symmetric for \u01ebf = \u2212U/2. The strongcoupling fixed point of Hi is characterized by an additional marginal operator which is\nproportional to the strength of the particle-hole symmetry breaking[26]. For energies\nlarger than the characteristic energy scale TK , a good agreement is found for the high\nenergy parts of the spectrum which is determined mainly by the mean occupation.\n\n\f17\n\nNon-Equilibrium Green's Functions for Quantum Impurity Models\n(a)\n\n0.4\n0.4\n\nU=1\nU=2\nU=4\nU=6\nU=8\nU=10\n\n0.3\n\n\u03c1(\u03c9)\n\n\u03c1(\u03c9)\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.2\n0\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n\u03c9/\u0393\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0\n-10\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n\u03c9/\u0393\n\n(b)\n\n4\n\n0.3\n\n8\n\n10\n\n6\n\n8\n\nH=0.05\nH=0.1\nH=0.2\nH=0.5\n\n0.3\n\n\u03c1(\u03c9)\n\n6\n\n0.2\n\n\u03c1(\u03c9)\n\n0.1\n0.2\n0\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n\u03c9/\u0393\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0\n-10\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n\u03c9/\u0393\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nFigure 3.

Finite external magnetic field The particle-hole symmetry, present at H = 0\nis broken at a finite magnetic field. In Fig. 3(a), a comparison is shown between the\nequilibrium spectral functions (dashed lines) and \u03c1(\u03c9, t\u2032 \u2192 \u221e) obtained after switching\non a finite value of U in a fixed and finite magnetic field of H = 0.2. The position and\nheight of the many-body resonance is well reproduced. The small deviations for the\nequilibrium values increase with increasing value of U. A shift in spectral weight from\nnegative to positive frequencies of the majority spectrum at large values of U indicates a\nslight underestimation of the spin-polarization for values of U \u2265 8. Due to the total spin\nconservation of the Hamiltonian, a relaxation of the total magnetization is prohibited.\n\n\fNon-Equilibrium Green's Functions for Quantum Impurity Models\n\n18\n\n0.4\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n\u03c1(\u03c9)\n\n0.3\n\n\u03c1(\u03c9)\n\nU=8\n\u03b5i=-0.2\n\u03b5i=-0.1\n\u03b5i= 0\n\u03b5i= 0.1\n\u03b5i= 0.2\n\u03b5i=-3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n-0.4 -0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n-10\n\n-8\n\n0\n\n\u03c9/\u0393\n\n-6\n\n0.2 0.4\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n\u03c9/\u0393\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nFigure 4.

For variation of \u01ebif which changes the level occupancy nf\nvery moderately, the steady-state spectral function shows only marginal changes. We\nobserve a significant deviation from the equilibrium NRG spectral function only for a\nlarge negative initial value of \u01ebif /\u2206 = \u22123, for which the impurity is essentially doubly\noccupied. Although the shape and position of the high-energy excitation maxima are\nwell reconstructed in this case, the strongly reduced spectral weight of the low frequency\nresonance close to the chemical potential requires additional spectral weight at high\nenergies, a consequence of the sum-rule conserving algorithm.\nParticle-hole asymmetric spectral functions are displayed in Fig. 5 for three different\nvalues of U. Here, we have chosen the non-interaction resonant level model Hi such that\nthe low-temperature fixed point spectra is identical to the one of Hf .\nSince the algorithm always evaluates the spectral function at a finite temperature\ndefined by TN \u221d \u039b\u2212N/2 of the last NRG iteration[12, 25, 26, 13] we can also track the\ntemperature evolution of the spectra. For one set of parameters used in Fig. 5, such a\ntemperature evolution of the steady-state spectra is shown in Fig. 6. Dashed and solid\nlines of equal color (color-online) correspond to the same temperature. Fig. 6 clearly\ndemonstrates that the steady-state algorithm can be used for the temperature evolution\nof spectral functions as well.\n4. Conclusion and Outlook\nWe have presented a new algorithm to calculate non-equilibrium Green functions G(t, t\u2032 )\nfor quantum-impurity models. It is derived using the complete basis set for the\n\n\fNon-Equilibrium Green's Functions for Quantum Impurity Models\n\n20\n\nWilson NRG chain[14, 15]. Therefore, the spectral sum-rule is always fulfilled exactly,\nindependent of the number Ns of kept states after each NRG iteration. We have shown\nthe algorithm for calculating equilibrium spectral functions[17, 18] is included in our\napproach for the case of an unaltered Hamiltonian Hi = Hf .\nWe believe, that this algorithm will open new doors for theoretical calculations\nof non-equilibrium quantum systems. In another publication[19], we have applied our\nmethod to a non-equilibrium problem for which the answer is not known a priori: an\nopen quantum system comprising of a quantum dot coupled to two leads whose chemical\npotential difference drives a current through this interacting junction. Only for the noninteracting problem (U = 0), the exact solution is known[21]. However, by switching on\nthe full Coulomb repulsion HU at finite bias, the steady-state non-equilibrium spectral\nfunction evolves from this initially known solution. The steady-state currents through\nan interacting nano-device is accessible to the numerical renormalization group method\nin the strong-coupling regime at finite bias. This method has the advantage that it\nis applicable to any arbitrary coupling strength, magnetic field and temperature. In\ncontrast to perturbative approaches it allows the study of the crossover from the weakcoupling regime at high temperatures to the strong-coupling regime at low temperatures\nand finite bias.\nIn this paper, we have restricted ourselves to the relevant case of switching on a\nfinite Coulomb repulsion U at t\u2032 = 0. Focusing on the steady-state limit t\u2032 \u2192 \u221e,\nwe used the well studied equilibrium spectral functions of the SIAM as benchmark for\nthe steady-stated spectra obtained with our method. Since a closed quantum impurity\nsystem will evolve into its thermodynamic equilibrium[24], if only Himp + HI is changed,\nthe deviation between the steady-state and the equilibrium spectra serves as a measure\nfor the quality of the algorithm.\nWe have shown that the steady-state spectral functions agree excellently with the\ncorresponding equilibrium spectra even at finite magnetic field. The absorbing of the\nHartree term into the non-interacting part of the Hamiltonian yields the best agreement\nbetween the steady-state spectra and the equilibrium NRG spectra directly obtained\nfrom Hf . The singly peaked spectrum of the resonant level model evolves into the\ntypical three peak structure of the SIAM in the Kondo regime, with the lower and high\nfrequency peaks resulting from charge fluctuations and a narrow many-body Kondo\nresonance emerging close to the chemical potential whose width is proportional to the\ncorrect low energy scale.\nAcknowledgments\nWe acknowledge discussions with N.
