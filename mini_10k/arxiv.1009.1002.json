Other methods such as the Boundary Element Method (BEM)\nare generally limited to weakly heterogeneous linear media but allow an accurate description\nof the radiated waves at infinity [6,14,15]. Another limitation of the classical BEM is that it\nleads to unsymmetric fully populated matrices. New efficient Fast BEM formulations have\nbeen recently proposed to model 3D elastic wave propagation [16,17].\n1.2\nMethods to deal with spurious reflections\nThe problem of spurious reflections may be dealt with using the BEM or coupling it with\nanother numerical method [18]. At very large scales, domain Reduction Methods are also\navailable in the framework of Finite Element approaches [19].\nAnother alternative is to directly attenuate the spurious reflections at the mesh boundaries\nconsidering Non Reflecting Boundary Conditions (NRBCs). A detailed review of such\ntechniques was proposed by Givoli [20] and Harari and Shohet [21] and a recent paper by\nFesta and Vilotte [22] gives additional references. The various NRBCs approaches may be\ncharacterized the following way:\n\uf0b7\nAbsorbing boundary conditions (\"ABCs\"): they involve specific conditions at the model\nboundaries to approximate the radiation condition for the elastic waves [4,13]. Engquist\nand Majda [23] proposed a technique based on local approximate boundary conditions of\nincreasing order (also see the work of Bayliss and Turkel [24]). Since these techniques\ninvolve \"one-way\" boundary operators (i.e. along one direction only), it is difficult to avoid\nspurious reflections due to various wave types involving different polarizations.\nFurthermore, the extension of such techniques to elastic waves leads to complex\nsystems of equations difficult to analyze in terms of stability [22]. Givoli [20] also\nproposed NRBCs (Dirichlet-to-Neumann, \"DtN\", operator) that are nonlocal in space or in\ntime (or both) and may be considered as more effective than local boundary conditions\n(independent of the angle of incidence).\n\uf0b7\nInfinite elements: they allow the approximation of the decaying laws governing the waves\nradiation process at infinity [25]. The principle is to use finite elements with their end\nnodes moved at infinity. Their drawbacks are similar to that of the absorbing boundaries.\n\uf0b7\nAbsorbing boundary layers (\"ABLs\"): such methods (e.g. Perfectly Matched Layers or\nPMLs) have been widely studied in the recent years [26,27,28,29,30]. The PML\ntechnique, introduced by B\u00e9renger in the field of electromagnetics [31], is based on the\ndescription of attenuating properties along a specific direction in an absorbing layer of\nfinite thickness located at the medium boundaries. Inside the PML, a field described by\nthe plane wave exp[ \uf02d i (k.x \uf02d \uf077 t )] decreases, in the xi direction, by a factor generally\nindependent of frequency [22]:\n\uf0e6 k\nexp \uf0e7 \uf02d i\n\uf0e8 \uf077\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\uf0f2 \uf061 i (\uf07a )d \uf07a\n\n\uf0f6\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \uf061i is an analytical function.\nThe extension of PML techniques to acoustic and elastic wave propagation was\nproposed by various authors [27,32,33,34]. Classical PMLs are more efficient than\n\"ABCs\" but several cases lead to some instabilities: grazing incidence, shallow models\ninvolving surface waves, anisotropic media. Several improved PML formulations were\nrecently proposed to overcome such difficulties. The filtering or convolutional PML allows\n\n2\n\n\fInt. J. for Numerical Methods in Eng., 2010 (to appear)\n\nSemblat et al.\n\nthe treatment of surface waves in shallow media [27]. In this formulation, the field decay\nin the xi direction is governed by a factor depending on frequency [22]:\n\uf0e6 k \uf077 2 \uf02d i \uf077\uf077\nc\nexp \uf0e7 \uf02d i\n\uf0e7 \uf077 \uf0772 \uf02b\uf0772\nc\n\uf0e8\n\n\uf0f2 \uf061 i (\uf07a )d \uf07a\n\n\uf0f6\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \uf077c is a cut-off frequency.\nThe multi-directional PML formulation was recently proposed to deal with grazing\nincidences and strong anisotropies [30]. It allows various choices for the attenuation\nvector \uf061 in the absorbing layer:\nu \uf03d A exp( \uf02d \u03b1.x ) exp[ \uf02d i (k.x \uf02d \uf077 t )]\n\n(3)\n\nwhere u is the displacement vector, A the polarization vector, x the position vector, k the\nwave vector, \uf077 the frequency and t the time.\nIt is thus possible to deal with various wave types (i.e. polarizations) and incidences. The\nmulti-directional PML formulation leads to better efficiency and numerical stability.\nIn this paper, we propose a simple and reliable absorbing layer method to reduce the\nspurious reflections at the model boundaries. The interest of the method is to be simple since\nthe damping model is already available in most of the general purpose finite element\nsoftwares.\n2.\n\nA Simple Multi-Directional Absorbing Layer Method\n\n2.1\nBasic idea\nSince the better ideas to deal with spurious reflections are to consider absorbing layers and\nmulti-directional attenuating properties, our goal is to proceed as for the PML technique but\nwith a simple description of the attenuation process. Physical models are generally very\nefficient to describe the attenuation process (frequency dependence, causality, etc) but they\nare nevertheless not very easy to implement or cost effective due to the use of memory\nvariables for instance [35,36,37,38,39,40,41]. Since Caughey damping is already available in\nmost of the finite element softwares, we propose to use this formulation to describe the\nattenuation of the waves in an absorbing layer of finite thickness. The method is thus called\nthe Caughey Absorbing Layer Method or \"CALM\". This damping formulation is purely\nnumerical but, as recalled hereafter, a rheological interpretation is possible in some cases\n(i.e. 2nd order Caughey formulation).\n2.2\nRayleigh and Caughey damping\nRayleigh damping is a classical method to easily build the damping matrix [C] for a Finite\nElement model [3,4] under the following form :\n\n\uf05bC \uf05d \uf03d a 0 \uf05bM \uf05d \uf02b a1 \uf05bK \uf05d\n\n(4)\n\nwhere [M] and [K] are the mass and stiffness matrices of the whole model respectively. It is\nthen called Rayleigh damping matrix and a0,a1 are the Rayleigh coefficients. [C] is the sum of\ntwo terms: one is proportional to the mass matrix, the other to the stiffness matrix.\nA more general damping formulation was proposed by Caughey [42,43] and is expressed as\nfollows:\n\n\uf05bC \uf05d \uf03d \uf05bM \uf05d \uf0e5 a j \uf028\uf05bM \uf05d\uf02d 1 \uf05bK \uf05d\uf029\nm \uf02d1\nj \uf03d0\n\n3\n\nj\n\n(5)\n\n\fInt. J. for Numerical Methods in Eng., 2010 (to appear)\n\nSemblat et al.\n\nAs evidenced by Eq. (5), the Rayleigh formulation (Eq. (4)) corresponds to a 2nd order\nCaughey damping (m=2) involving a linear combination of the mass and stiffness matrices.\nThese ways to build the damping matrix are very convenient since it can be easily computed\nand is often available in general purpose FEM softwares. Furthermore, for modal\napproaches, the Rayleigh (or Caughey) damping matrix is diagonal in the real modes base\n[4,44]. Damping is therefore called proportional or classical. In case of non proportional\ndamping, the complex modes have to be computed (in order to uncouple the modal\nequations).\nRayleigh (or Caughey) damping formulation may also be used to analyze the propagation of\ndamped elastic wave [4,45]. For such problems, it may be useful to have a rheological\ninterpretation of these purely numerical formulations. In the field of mechanical wave\npropagation, the equivalence between the Rayleigh formulation and a Generalized Maxwell\nmodel was already proposed [45] and is briefly recalled hereafter.\n2.3\nRheological interpretation of Rayleigh damping\nConsidering Rayleigh damping [4,44] (i.e. 2nd order Caughey damping), the loss factor \uf068 can\nbe written as follows :\n\uf068 \uf03d 2\uf078 \uf03d\n\na0\n\n\uf077\n\n\uf02b a 1\uf077\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \uf077 is the circular frequency and \uf078 is the damping ratio.\nConsidering the relationship between internal friction and frequency for Rayleigh damping, it\nis possible to build a rheological model involving the same attenuation-frequency\ndependence [45]. For a linear viscoelastic rheological model of complex modulus M=MR+iMI\n[4,46], the expression of the quality factor Q is given in the fields of geophysics and acoustics\nas follows:\nQ \uf03d\n\nMR\n\n(7)\n\nMI\n\nFor weak to moderate Rayleigh damping, there is a simple relation between the inverse of\nthe quality factor Q-1 and the damping ratio \uf078 [4,44]:\nQ\n\n\uf02d1\n\n\uf0bb 2\uf078\n\n(8)\n\nFor Rayleigh damping, the loss factor is infinite for zero and infinite frequencies. It clearly\ngives the behaviour of the model through instantaneous and long term responses. As shown\nin [45], the rheological model perfectly meeting these requirements (attenuation-frequency\ndependence, instantaneous and long term effects) is a particular type of generalized Maxwell\nmodel.\nFig. 2 gives a schematic of the proposed rheological interpretation: it connects, in parallel, a\nclassical Maxwell cell to a single dashpot. The generalized Maxwell model may be\ncharacterized by its complex modulus [4,46] from which we easily derive the inverse of the\nquality factor Q-1 which takes the same form as the loss factor of Rayleigh damping\n(expression (6)) : it is the sum of two terms, one proportional to frequency and one inversely\nproportional to frequency.\n\n4\n\n\fa m p litu d e\n\nInt.

If one needs to characterize a real\nmaterial, the Rayleigh coefficients may thus be identified from experimental results. In this\npaper, a target theoretical damping will be chosen for a fictitious absorbing material (no\nexperiments are needed).\n2.4\nCaughey Absorbing Layer Method\nIn the framework of the Finite Element Method, an elastic medium is considered and an\nabsorbing layer system will be designed at its boundaries. The absorbing layer is thus\nmodelled with appropriate damping properties (i.e. Rayleigh/Caughey damping coefficients)\nin order to attenuate the spurious reflections at the mesh boundaries. This Caughey\nAbsorbing Layer Method (\"CALM\") may thus reduce the amplitude of the elastic wave\n\n5\n\n\fInt. J. for Numerical Methods in Eng., 2010 (to appear)\n\nSemblat et al.\n\ncoming from the elastic medium and reflecting at the artificial boundaries of the medium. In\nthe following, the proposed technique is described for different damping variations in the\nabsorbing layer thickness. The spatial variations of damping are controlled by variable\ndamping coefficients in the Finite Elements. Such techniques were already used to model\nwave propagation in media with stress state dependent damping [47,48]. Considering\nRayleigh damping, the element damping matrix for finite element \"e\" is thus written:\n\n\uf05bC \uf05d( e )\n\n(e )\n\n\uf03d a0\n\n\uf05bM \uf05d( e )\n\n(e )\n\n\uf02b a1\n\n\uf05bK \uf05d( e )\n\n(10)\n\nwhere [M](e) and [K](e) are the mass and stiffness matrices for finite element \"e\" respectively.\nThe Rayleigh damping coefficients a 0( e ) and a 1( e ) may be different in each finite element or\nchosen piecewise constant in the absorbing layer. In the following, the efficiency of the\nCaughey Absorbing Layer Method is assessed for 1D and 2D elastic wave propagation.\n\n3. Efficiency of the 1D Caughey Absorbing Layer\n3.1\n\nDefinition of the propagating wave\n\nFor the 1D case, a 2nd order Ricker wavelet is considered [4,49]. As depicted in Fig. 1, this\ntype of wavelet is derived from a Gaussian and is rather well localized in both time and\nfrequency domain [4]. It is thus ideal to perform a detailed analysis on wave propagation in a\nnarrow frequency band investigating the reflection of short duration waves (to easily\ndistinguish incident and reflected waves). We shall consider longitudinal elastic waves first\nand the predominant frequency of the Ricker wavelet fR =1/tp will be chosen in order to have\nan integer number of wavelengths along the medium. For the finite element computations, a\nNewmark non dissipative time integration scheme is chosen in order to avoid algorithmic\ndamping [4,12] due to the time integration process.\n\n3.2\n\nRayleigh damping in the absorbing layer\n\nIn the following, the absorbing layer involves Rayleigh damping (2nd order Caughey damping)\nwhich is frequency dependent (Fig.2) and is rheologically equivalent to a Generalized\nMaxwell model for wave propagation problems [45]. To define a reference attenuation value\n(inverse of the quality factor Q-1) in the absorbing layer, the minimum attenuation value will\nbe chosen at the predominant frequency of the Ricker wavelet fR. Since the Generalized\nMaxwell model has a band-pass behavior (Fig.2, right), it is thus probably the worst case in\nterms of efficiency of the absorbing layer. From the expression of the damping ratio, Eq. (6),\nit is possible to determine the frequency of minimum damping \uf077min from the Rayleigh\ncoefficients as follows:\n\uf077 min \uf03d\n\na0\n\n(11)\n\na1\n\n\uf02d1\nChoosing the minimum damping \uf078min (or attenuation Q min\n) at the predominant frequency of\nthe Ricker wavelet fR, it is then possible to derive the following relation:\n\n\uf077 R \uf03d 2\uf070 f R \uf03d\n\na0\na1\n\n(12)\n\nand thus, using the definition of Rayleigh damping, derive the following system:\na0\n\uf0ec \uf02d1\n\uf02b a 1\uf077 R\n\uf0efQ min \uf03d 2\uf078 min \uf03d\n\uf077R\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ed\n\uf0ef\uf077 \uf03d 2 \uf070 f \uf03d a 0\nR\n\uf0ef R\na1\n\uf0ee\n\n6\n\n(13)\n\n\fInt. J. for Numerical Methods in Eng., 2010 (to appear)\n\nSemblat et al.\n\nFrom the choice of the predominant frequency of the Ricker wavelet fR and the minimum\n\uf02d1\nattenuation Q min\n, the Rayleigh damping coefficients in the absorbing layer may then be\n\uf02d1\nestimated. In the following, we shall choose several typical values for Q min\nranging from 0.5\n(i.e. \uf078min=0.25 or 25%) to 2.0 (i.e. \uf078min=1.0 or 100%).\n\n3.3\n\nHomogeneously absorbing case\n\n3.3.1 Description of the homogeneous absorbing layer system\nAs depicted in Fig. 3, the first numerical case corresponds to a 1D elastic medium (left) and a\nhomogeneously absorbing layer (right). The length of the elastic layer (left) is 4\uf06c and that of\nthe homogeneously damped layer (right) is \uf06c (\uf06c: wavelength of the longitudinal wave). Linear\nquadrilateral finite elements are considered and a \uf06c/20 size is chosen in order to have low\nnumerical wave dispersion [11,12]. In the elastic medium, the element damping matrices\n\uf05bC \uf05d( e ) are zero whereas homogeneous Rayleigh damping is considered in the absorbing\nlayer by choosing identical Rayleigh coefficients a 0( e ) , a1( e ) for each element damping matrix in\nthis area (the elastic properties being identical in both domains). In each case, the\nattenuation value Q-1 is chosen as the minimum attenuation value at the predominant\nfrequency of the propagating wave (Ricker wavelet). As shown in Fig. 2, because of the\ndamping-frequency dependence given by the Rayleigh formulation, all other frequency\ncomponents are thus more strongly attenuated in the layer. Three attenuation values were\n\uf02d1\nchosen for the homogeneously absorbing case: Q min\n=0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 (leading to damping\nvalues \uf078 min =25, 50 and 100% respectively).\n\uf06c\n\n4\uf06c\nva ria b le\nb ou n da ry\nco nd itio n\n\n1 D elas tic m e dium\nA\n\nB\n\nh om og . da m pe d\nla ye r\n\nx\n\nFig. 3.

It is due to the velocity contrast between the elastic medium\n\uf02d1\nand the viscoelastic layer (in terms of complex wavenumber). For Q min\n=0.5 at point B\n(top right, solid), the amplitude at the interface between the elastic medium and the\nabsorbing layer is also small (5.50%). The efficiency of the homogeneously absorbing\nlayer thus appears acceptable.\n\n8\n\n\fInt.

This is due to\nthe fact that the complex velocity contrast with the elastic medium is larger for\n\uf02d1\nQ min =1.0.\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\uf02d1\nFinally, for Q min\n=2.0 (bottom, solid), the contrast being larger again, the results are not\nvery good for the wave reflected at the interface (18.8%). However the reflected wave\nat the end of the absorbing layer is again very small (1.30%) and the amplitude at the\ninterface (point B) is nearly zero.\n\nThe authors obtained similar results for transverse waves (SV waves). From these three\ndifferent homogeneously damped cases, the Caughey Absorbing Layer Method (\"CALM\")\ncan already be considered as an efficient absorbing layer method but its efficiency may\nprobably be improved and its artefacts reduced.\n\n3.4\n\nHeterogeneously absorbing case\n\nIn the homogeneous case, the velocity contrast between the elastic layer and the absorbing\nlayer may have a detrimental effect. The idea is now to have an increasing damping value in\nthe absorbing layer system along the direction of the incident wave and a lower damping\ncontrast at the interface with the elastic medium.\n\n3.4.1 Description of the heterogeneous absorbing layer system\nAs depicted in Fig. 5, the second numerical case corresponds to a heterogeneously\nabsorbing layer.

A closer view on the reflected\nwaves is also proposed (right).

J. for Numerical Methods in Eng., 2010 (to appear)\n\nSemblat et al.\n\nFrom these results, it appears that it is necessary to balance the advantage of a strong\ndamping in a thick layer (strong amplitude reduction in the layer) and slow variations of the\ndamping properties (low amplitude for the reflections at the interfaces). Since in the PML\napproach, the parameters governing the amplitude decrease (or the coordinate stretching)\nare \"perfectly matched\" at the interface [26,27,28,29,30], the case of a continuous damping\nvariation in the absorbing layer will thus be studied hereafter.\n\n3.5\n\nContinuously varying damping\n\n3.5.1 Description of the continuous absorbing layer system\nAs depicted in Fig. 7, the third numerical case corresponds to a continuously varying\ndamping in the absorbing layer. The absorbing layer involves variable Rayleigh damping\ncoefficients increasing linearly with the horizontal distance. The idea is to have a\ncontinuously increasing damping value in the absorbing layer system. Two cases are\n\uf02d1\nconsidered: attenuation Q min\nincreasing linearly from 0 to 1.0 (1st case) and from 0 to 2.0 (2nd\ncase).\n\uf06c\n\n4\uf06c\nva ria b le\nb ou n da ry\nco nd itio n\n\n1 D elas tic m e dium\nA\n\nB\n\nco ntin . da m pe d\nla ye r\n\nx\n\nFig. 7.

Closer views are also displayed in this Figure (right).

For the reflection at the medium\n\uf02d1\nboundary, the efficiency of the continuous system is a bit less for Q min\n=1.0 (5.25% vs 4.41%)\n\uf02d1\nwhereas it is nearly the same for Q min\n=2.0 (2.80% vs 2.86%).

The thickness of this absorbing\nlayer system being smaller than in the previous case (Fig. 9 top), the efficiency of this\nconfiguration should be less due to a shorter travelling distance in the layer (see Eq. (3))\nwhereas the number of degrees of freedom in the Finite Element model will be less.\n\n11\n\n\fInt. J. for Numerical Methods in Eng., 2010 (to appear)\n\n-1\n\nu nd am p ed\n\n-1\n\nh om og .

Efficiency of the 2D Caughey Absorbing Layer for pure P-waves\n4.1\n\nSimple 2D case from the PML technique: geometry and loading\n\nTo analyze the efficiency of the CALM in 2D configurations, we shall first study a simple 2D\ncase involving pure P-waves. We shall consider a simple 2D case proposed by Festa and\nVilotte [22] for pure P-waves in the framework of the PML technique. As shown in Fig. 11, a\n2D absorbing layer is designed all around a square elastic domain. The wave velocities are\nVP=4 km/s and VS=2.31 km/s and the mass density is \uf072=2.5 g/cm3 (see [22] for other details\non the PML model). The size of the elastic domain (2L=1500m) thus corresponds to 3.75\uf06cP\nand the width of the Caughey absorbing layer is chosen as \uf06cP/2. As Festa and Vilotte [22]\nchose an explosive source using a Ricker wavelet for the time variations (tp=0.1s, i.e.\nfp=10Hz), we considered a finite element model (Fig. 11 right) involving a pressure loading\nwith similar time variations.\n\uf06c P /2\n0\np ( t)\nL= 750m =1.875 \uf06c P\n\n\uf06c P /2\np0\n0\n\nts\n\n2 ts\n\n3 ts\n\n4t s\n\ntim e (s)\n\nexplo sive\nsource\n\np ( t)\n\n2L= 1500m = 3.75 \uf06c P\n\nu y= 0\n\nu x= 0\n\nabsorbing layer\n\nabsorbing layer\n\n2L+ \uf06c P =1900 m = 4.7 5 \uf06c P\n\nFig. 11. 2D plane strain model for pure P-waves proposed by Festa and Vilotte (2005):\nadapted schematic (left), pressure loading (top right) and finite element model considered for\nthe CALM (bottom right).\n\n4.2\n\nComparison between the Caughey Absorbing Layer Method and PMLs\n\nThe wavefield is computed in terms of normalized displacement u \uf03d u / p 0 ( u\n\nbeing the\n\nnorm of the displacement vector and p 0 the maximum loading pressure) for the undamped\n\uf02d1\n2D case and the 5 layers 2D case ( Q min\n=0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6 and 2.0 in each layer resp.). The\nnumerical results are displayed in Fig. 12 for three different normalized times\nt 1 \uf03d t 1 / t p \uf03d 2 . 49 (left) ; t 2 \uf03d t 2 / t p \uf03d 3 . 32 (centre) ; t 3 \uf03d t 3 / t p \uf03d 4 . 56\n(right). For the\n\nundamped case (Fig. 12 top), the wave reflections at the model boundaries are obvious for\ntimes t 2 and t 3 . For the Caughey absorbing layer (Fig. 12 bottom), the wavefield is partially\nabsorbed in the first layers at time t 2 and no reflections from the model boundaries appear at\ntime t 3 . Similar results were obtained by Festa and Vilotte [22] for the PML technique. The\n\n14\n\n\fInt. J. for Numerical Methods in Eng., 2010 (to appear)\n\nSemblat et al.\n\nthickness of the absorbing layer is nevertheless larger in CALM. The efficiency is also less\nsince, for the same configuration, Festa and Vilotte obtained reflections coefficients ranging\nfrom 0.1% to 1% for a cubic decay function and from 0.6% to 2% for a quadratic decay\nfunction [22]. They also studied 2D cases to describe soft geological deposits such as a thin\nsurface layer or a curved surface layer.\nSince the previous results correspond to a simple incident wavefield, we shall now study a\nmore complex case in terms of both polarization and incidences.\n-1 0\n\nu (x10 )\n\nt1\n\n0.00\n1.158\n2.317\n\n2.317\n3.475\n4.634\n\n4.634\n5.792\n6.951\n\n6.951\n8.109\n9.268\n\nt2\n\n9.268\n10 .42 6\n11.585\n\nt3\nu n da m p e d\n\nt1\n\nt2\n\n5 la yers\n-1\nQ = 2 .0\n\nt3\n\nFig. 12.

Efficiency of the 2D Caughey Absorbing Layer for various wave types\n5.1\n\nDefinition of the propagating wave and geometry\n\nTo assess the efficiency of the Caughey Absorbing Layer Method for more complex 2D\nwavefields, another 2D FEM model is considered (Fig. 13). A plane strain model is chosen in\norder to avoid strong geometrical damping. It involves a 4\uf06cx4\uf06c square elastic medium and\ntwo \uf06c thick absorbing layers (right and bottom). The model is symmetrical along the left\nboundary and the variable boundary condition (vertical displacement varying as a Ricker\nwavelet at fR =1/tp) is applied at the free surface along a distance of \uf06c/2 (Fig. 13). The\nwavefield in the model is thus composed of various wavetypes (longitudinal, transverse and\nsurface waves) and the motion duration is larger than in the 1D case and the previous 2D\ncase. The element size, \uf06c/20, is identical to that of the 1D case.\nIt should be noticed that the total storage will be significantly increased but it is nevertheless\nindependent from the model size and the relative storage amount will thus be smaller for a\nlarger model.\n\n15\n\n\fInt.

Schematic of the 2D plane strain model (left) showing the boundary condition (top)\nand finite element mesh (right).\nThe efficiency of the homogeneous, heterogeneous and continuous damped cases will be\nassessed in the whole model (isovalues plots at some selected times) and at point A along\nthe free surface (normalized displacement vs normalized time).\n\n5.2\n\nEfficiency of the homogeneous absorbing layers\n\nThe results obtained in the homogeneous case are displayed in Fig. 14 in terms of\nnormalized displacement (norm of the displacement vector divided by the maximum\namplitude in the undamped case at the same time) at three different normalized times\n( t 1 \uf03d 4 . 15 , t 2 \uf03d 9 . 135 and t 3 \uf03d 14 . 1 ). For this displacement isovalue scale ( 0 . 0 \uf0a3 u \uf0a3 0 . 6 ),\nthe reflected waves are obvious in the undamped case (top). For both homogeneously\ndamped cases (middle and bottom), when compared to the amplitudes of the undamped\ncase, the first reflections are not significant at time t 2 (only the incident wavefield is present\nin this plot) and no reflection at all can be identified at time t 3 . The efficiency of the Caughey\nAbsorbing Layer Method thus appears satisfactory in the 2D homogeneous case.\nSince the displacement isovalues scale is rather large in Fig. 14, a narrower scale will now\nbe considered in order to compare the various cases in details.\nThe numerical results at time t 3 are displayed in Fig. 15 considering a displacement\namplitude range 0 . 00 \uf0a3 u \uf0a3 0 . 02 (some values above this range are displayed in white). In\nthe homogeneous case (top), the relative amplitude of the reflected wave is small for\n\uf02d1\nQ min =0.5 (2.48% of the maximum amplitude obtained in the undamped case (Fig. 15 top\n\uf02d1\n\uf02d1\nleft)). For larger damping values ( Q min\n=1.0: top centre and Q min\n=2.0: top right), the\nhomogeneously absorbing layer system leads to larger amplitudes of the reflected waves\n(4.67% and 10.4% respectively) probably due to the velocity contrast at the interface (see\nresults from the 1D case).\n\n5.3\n\nEfficiency of the heterogeneous absorbing layer\n\nFor the heterogeneous case, five absorbing layers are considered at the medium boundaries\n(bottom and right). In order to assess the influence of the damping variations, the linear\nincrease (already studied in the 1D case) is now compared to a quadratic and a square root\nlaw. The numerical results of the heterogeneous cases at time t 3 are displayed in Fig. 15\n(middle). The amplitude of the reflected wave is very small for the linear and square root laws\n\n16\n\n\fInt. J. for Numerical Methods in Eng., 2010 (to appear)\n\nSemblat et al.\n\n(1.53% and 1.87% respectively) and a bit larger for the quadratic law (3.00%).

The numerical results of the continuous cases at time t 3 are\ndisplayed in Fig. 15 (bottom). As for the heterogeneous case, the amplitude of the reflected\nwave is very small for the linear and square root laws (1.65% and 1.49% respectively) and a\nbit larger for the quadratic law (4.02%). The square root law leads to a faster damping\nincrease near the interface and works better in the continuous case due to the regular\nincrease of damping in the absorbing layer system (when compared to the piecewise\nconstant damping in the heterogeneous case).\n\n17\n\n\fInt.

The homogeneous case (a) for Q min\n=2.0 leads to a large amplitude\n\uf02d1\n(10.4%). For Q min\n=1.0 (b,c), the values were already discussed in the two previous\nparagraphs (best solutions with the linear and the square root laws). From additional\n\uf02d1\nsimulations with Q min\n=2.0 (d,e), the square root law appears as the worst solution (3.39%\nand 2.66% resp.) since the quadratic case gives much better results (2.30% and 2.20%\n\uf02d1\nresp.) than for Q min\n=1.0 (3.00% and 4.02% resp.). The continuous case (e) improves\nsignificantly the results for the different laws (when compared to the heterogeneous case (d))\ndue to the smoother description of the damping variations in the absorbing layer.\n\n18\n\n\fInt.

All 2D cases are considered: homogeneous case (top);\n\uf02d1\nheterogeneous and continuous case for Q min\n=1.0 (middle); heterogeneous and continuous\n\uf02d1\ncase for Q min\n=2.0 (bottom). As in the 1D case, the reflections at the interface and at the\nmedium boundaries are quantified in terms of maximum relative amplitude.\nIn the homogeneous case (Fig. 17, top), the reflected surface waves have large amplitudes\nwhen compared to the undamped case (5.60% to 22.9%). In the heterogeneous and\n\uf02d1\ncontinuous case for Q min\n=1.0 (Fig. 17, middle), the reflection at the interface leads to low\namplitudes (2.21% and 1.21% resp.) whereas the reflections at the medium boundaries are a\nbit larger (3.90% and 5.01% resp.). As shown by the time histories, the variations with time\nare strong and it is difficult to quantify an overall maximum amplitude in both time (Fig. 17)\nand space (Fig. 15).\n\uf02d1\nIn the heterogeneous and continuous case for Q min\n=2.0 (Fig. 17, bottom), the reflection at\nthe interface leads to low amplitudes (4.11% and 2.54% resp.) and the reflections at the\nmedium boundaries are also small (3.20% and 3.64% resp.). For such a maximum damping\nvalue, the continuous case is more efficient than the heterogeneous case. Since this 2D case\ninvolves various incidences, polarizations and wave types, the overall efficiency of the\nproposed method may thus be considered as satisfactory.\n\n6. Conclusion\nThe main conclusion of this work is that the Caughey Absorbing Layer Method (at least the\n2nd order CALM discussed herein) is reliable to reduce the spurious elastic wave reflections\nin Finite Element computations. Furthermore, when compared to PML techniques or\nviscoelastic mechanical models, it is very easy to implement (damping matrix directly\ncomputed from the stiffness and mass matrices) or even already available in most of the\ngeneral purpose Finite Element softwares.\nFrom the simple 2D simulations (pure P-waves), our results are at the same level as the 3rd\norder PML technique proposed by Festa and Vilotte [22] but our method needs a larger\nadditional storage (thicker absorbing layers). For more complex 2D wavefields, the efficiency\nof the Caughey Absorbing Layer Method is also shown to be satisfactory. In such complex\n\n19\n\n\fInt.

J. for Numerical Methods in Eng., 2010 (to appear)\n\nSemblat et al.\n\nIn future works, it will be necessary to assess the efficiency of the Caughey Absorbing Layer\nMethod in 3D realistic cases and to make some detailed comparisons with other existing\nmethods (e.g. PMLs). It may be also useful to consider higher order Caughey damping\n(Eq. (5)) leading to various types of damping-frequency variations. In addition to the Finite\nElement Method, the CALM may be considered in the framework of other numerical methods\nsuch as the Spectral Element Method [7,8].\nREFERENCES\n[1] Virieux J.
