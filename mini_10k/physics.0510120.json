Rev. Lett. 82(17), 3388-3391 (1999).\nPACS numbers: 07.79.Lh, 61.16.Ch, 68.35.Bs\n\nA few years ago, the resonant noncontact mode (hereafter noted NC-AFM) was developed to map tip surface interaction as shifts of the resonance frequency [1,2].\nSince then, numerous experimental efforts have been performed showing that measurements of shifts were able to\nproduce images at the atomic scale [3\u20137]. The \"routine\"\nachievement of the atomic resolution with the NC-AFM\n[7] is thought of as a real breakthrough in the field of the\nscanning probe microscopy. Moreover, the use of a high\nvibrating amplitude of the cantilever (CL) with the NCAFM and the development of the intermittent contact (the\nso-called tapping mode) [8\u201310] have boosted theoretical\nworks dedicated to a nonlinear analysis [11\u201314].\nBefore going a step further, it is worth discussing general ideas at a qualitative level. Leaving aside the technical point that the use of a high amplitude reduces the\ninfluence of the fluctuations in frequency [2], a first, counterintuitive, result is the use of a large vibrating amplitude\nallowing the atomic resolution to be achieved. Typically,\nthe amplitudes used are 100 times greater than the vertical\nmotion of the surface required, maintaining a given value\nof the frequency shift. The most common and shared idea\nis that to probe an attractive field with an oscillator requires the use of a small amplitude in order to keep the\nforce field nearly constant throughout the vibrating amplitude. The idea is that shifts in resonance frequency are\nuniquely due to the gradient force variations.\nAn image with the atomic resolution based on a\nrepulsive interaction appears quite easily understandable,\nbut getting the same resolution when the attractive van\nder Waals forces are involved is very puzzling. The\nvan der Waals atom-atom interaction and the finite size\nof the interacting objects lead to a tip-sample interaction\nsmoothly varying as a function of the CL-surface distance.\nFor instance, the sphere-plan interaction leads to an\nattractive force with a d 22 power law. The force gradient\ndependence, with a power law d 23 , gives a too smooth\nvariation of the resonance frequency and is unable to\npredict the observed shape of the frequency changes as\na function of the tip-sample distance.\nyyy\n\nThe key point with an AFM is that the recorded information comes from the tip-sample interaction, but when\nthe CL is externally periodically excited, the recorded image is a measure of the oscillating behavior of the CL.\nWhen the tip-microlever system experiences an attractive\nfield, the oscillator can exhibit a nonlinear behavior [14\u2013\n16]. For an oscillator set at a drive frequency slightly\nbelow the resonance one, a bifurcation from a monostable\nto a bistable state can occur as soon as the vibrating amplitude is large enough [14]. Keeping the amplitude constant, the shifts in resonance frequency show a continuous,\nmonotonous, variation as a function of the tip surface distance that can be very large when nonlinear effects take\nplace, and in turn amplify small changes of the strength of\nthe interaction.\nVariational method, principle of least action.-A\nvariational method can be developed based on the\nprinciple of least action [14]. The action Sfsxdg is a\nfunctional of the path xstd and is extremal between two\nfixed instants.\nZ tb\n\u00d9 td dt ,\nLsx, x,\n(1)\nSfxstdg -\nta\n\nwhere L is the Lagrangian of the system. The main aim\nof the use of the variational principle is to employ a\ntrial function that allows us to perform a nonperturbative\nanalytical treatment in which the dissipation is included.\nAs for the treatment of the Duffing oscillator [15,16], we\nfocus on the behavior of the harmonic solution of the\nform xstd - AsDd cosfvt 2 fsDdg. Using a sphere-plan\ninteraction [17], a Lagrangian is obtained,\nL-T 2U 1W\n\u221a\n!\n1 2\nHR\n1\n2\nmx\u00d9 2\nkx 2 xf cossvtd 2\n-\n2\n2\n6sD 2 xd\n2 gx x\u00d9 ,\n(2)\nwhere H is the Hamaker constant, R the radius of the\ntip, D the distance between the surface and the CL\nat the equilibrium position at rest, and g the damping\ncoefficient. The parameters of the path are A and f, and\n\n\fthe variational principle dS - 0 becomes a set of two\npartial differential equations,\n\u2260S\n- 0,\n\u2260A\n\u2260S\n- 0.\n\u2260f\nAfter some tedious calculations, two coupled nonlinear\nequations are obtained,\ncosf - Qas1 2 u2 d 2\n\na\na\n,\n2\n3 sd 2 a2 d3y2\n\nsinf - au ,\n\n(3a)\n(3b)\n\nwhere the amplitude, the distance, and the frequency are\nexpressed in reduced coordinates a - AyA0 and d -\nDyA0 , u - vyv0 , where v0 and A0 are the frequency\nv\nu\n\"\n\u221a\nu\nu1\n1\nu-t 2 2\n16\na\n2Q\n\nand amplitude at the resonance far from the surface.\nFinally, the dimensionless parameter a is used,\nHRQ\na-\n,\n(4)\nkc A03\nwhere kc - mv02 is the CL stiffness. At a fixed drive\nfrequency, with a , 1 a bifurcation from a monostable\nto a bistable state can be observed, while for a . 1,\nthe instabilities disappear [14]. When a molecule-plan\ninteraction is used, the dimensionless parameter becomes\nHR 3 Q\na - k A5 and the power law is sd 2 2 a2 d27y2 [18].\nc 0\nSolving Eqs.

Practically, the use of\nEq. (9) [or Eq. (7)] to fit the experimental results might\nhelp to decide whether or not the tip touches the surface.\nEquation (9) gives a result similar to the one obtained\nwith a perturbative approach, which does not consider the\ndissipation [19]. Equation (13) of Ref. [19] predicts that\n23y2\nDn scales as A0 , a power-law dependence which can\nbe derived from Eq. (9) with the assumption that A0 is\nlarge and D is nearly equal to A0 . Writing sd 2 2 1d3y2 -\n2 3y2\n2\nfor D - A0 1  \u0301 with  \u0301 \u00f8 A0 one gets\nA23\n0 sD 2 A0 d\n\n23y2\n\nDn , A0  \u030123y2 , the validity of this expression being a\nfunction of the ratio  \u0301yA0 . To measure DnsA0 d, the tipsample distance  \u0301 has to be kept constant while varying\nthe amplitude A0 . As discussed in Ref. [19], the work performed by Kitamura and Iwatsuki [5] gives a Dn of 10 Hz\nat A0 - 10 nm and 150 Hz at A0 - 1.5 nm. Thus a ratio lnfnsA0 - 1.5dyDnsA0 - 10dgy lnfsA0 - 1.5dysA0 -\n10dg - 21.43; this result shows the influence of the approximation as A0 - 1.5 nm is a rather small value of the\namplitude. To evaluate the distance  \u0301, we use the value\ncalculated in Ref. [20] that gives the tip surface distance\nat which a force image can be recorded in a pure attractive\nregime between a diamond tip and a NaCl surface. Tang\net al. found a tip-sample distance  \u0301 of about 0.35 nm. Inserting this value in Eq. (9), a linear fit of the log log plot of\nLogsDnd versus logsA0 d gives a slope of 21.438 between\nA0 - 1 nm and A0 - 15 nm and 21.464 for resonance\namplitudes ranging between 1 and 40 nm, thus a remarkable agreement with the experimental data.\nBecause of the use of reduced coordinates, the powerlaw dependence does not appear clearly from Eq. (9). The\nuse of reduced coordinates is an usual way to describe\nthe stationary state of an oscillator. But while with a\nlinear behavior the amplitude of the forcing can be scaled\nout, when a nonlinear behavior occurs, the amplitude of\n\n\fthe forcing becomes a new operative parameter that can\nsignificantly alter the dynamical phenomena exhibited by\nthe oscillator. Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that\nthe use of reduced coordinates is particularly fruitful to\ndescribe experiments in which a fixed driven frequency\nis chosen [14,21]. The main interest is to exhibit a\ndimensionless parameter a [Eq. (4)] being able to give\nthe conditions for which the bifurcation of the amplitude\n\nand the phase are observed. The predictions given by the\nmodel were experimentally verified [14,21].\nFor the present purpose, the structure of Eq. (6) suggests that rather than a it is more suitable to seek for\ncritical values of the ratio ayQ. The location of the bifurcation is given by the condition duyda - 0 (point C in\nFig. 2). The resonance peak starts to distort when all the\npoints A, B, C, and D collapse in two points. For a given\nu value two amplitudes are reached, asud and a - 1. Using this property we derived an analytical expression from\nEq. (7) [22] giving the domain of bifurcation as a function\nof ayQ and d (Fig. 3). The curve determines the frontier between two domains, the domain in which the resonance peak is slightly distorted and keeps approximately a\nLorentzian shape and the domain of bifurcation given by\nthe upper part of the curve. Note that the domain of bifurcation is significantly reduced for low values of Q. This\nresult illustrates a more general principle that the domain\nof bifurcation and, if it occurs, a chaotic behavior are less\nimportant with maximum dissipation [23].\nAs soon as the quality factor is large enough, the\nsensitivity of the oscillating CL is given by the ratio\nHRykc A30 . For a given value of the product HR, the same\nvariation of the frequency as a function of the reduced\ndistance is expected when the product kc A03 is kept\nconstant. For example, for a kc value 8 times smaller, to\nget the same frequency shift at the same reduced distance\nrequires the use of an amplitude A0 twice larger. In other\nwords, one gets the same sensitivity with a distance D\nand a closest distance  \u0301 twice larger. This result can be\ndirectly derived from Eqs. (7) or (9).\nThe description of the instabilities experienced by the\nCL dynamical system is not straightforward. When the\nCL oscillates, the oscillating behavior is described with\ntwo coordinates in the phase space. A consequence is\n\nFIG. 2. Shifts in resonance frequency DnNL correspond to\nshifts given by the black arrows. Because of the experimental\nuncertainties and the flatness of the distorted curve (Fig. 1),\neven with a constant amplitude mode various situations can\noccur. If the oscillator is trapped on the lower instable curve\n(black circle on the dotted line), then a cycle of hysteresis\nfollowing the path A0 BCD follows.\n\nFIG. 3. Determination of the domain of bifurcation calculated\nfor two values of the quality factor Q. The curves are\ncalculated with the equation given in Ref. [22]. The curves\nacrit yQ give the frontier above which the resonance peak starts\nto distort.\n\nFIG. 1. Resonance curves calculated with Eq. (6) for different\nCL-surface distances d, with Q - 20 000, HR - 10227 J m,\nand A0 - 10 nm (continuous line kc - 11 N m21 ). The flatness of the distorted curve gives a slope daydn , 0, which\nmeans that any small fluctuations of the amplitude can lead to a\nlarge variation of the measured frequency (see text and Fig. 2).\nAlso shown is the influence of the cantilever stiffness on the\nshape of the resonance curve (empty squares kc - 2 N m21 ).\n\n\fthat the phase relationship between the oscillator and the\nattractive force varies as a function of the CL surface\ndistance, and experimental situations were found where\nthe attractive interaction acts as a repulsive one [14]. In\nNC-AFM the amplitude is kept constant and equal to\nthe resonance one; thus the phase should normally be\na constant. But as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the ability\nto follow the resonance frequency becomes more and\nmore difficult as the distortion of the resonance curve\nincreases. The fluctuations of the amplitude, even of\nthe order of dA0 yA0 - 1024 , can induce a measured\nfrequency different than that of the resonance one, thus\ngiving a value of the phase different from 2py2 (Fig. 2).\nEven worse is the fact that the oscillator has the possibility\nof being in a state belonging to the lower instable curve\nproducing a phase jump.\nWhile Eqs. (7) and (9) give qualitatively a similar behavior to the ones observed experimentally [3,5\u20137], quantitatively the use of such analytical expressions remains\nquestionable. As shown by various groups, spectacular\nvariations on the image were observed as a function of\nthe chosen frequency shift Dn [7]. The larger the values of Dn, the smaller is the tip-sample distance at which\nthe images are recorded. Therefore as a function of the\ntip-sample distance, the surface can interact in a different\nmanner with the tip. Not only the geometrical factors may\nvary for different values of the frequency shift, making the\nwhole dependence of Dn a mixing of different power laws\nas a function of the tip-sample distance [18], but also, particularly when the resonance curve are strongly distorted\n(Figs. 1 and 2), one cannot be completely sure that the\nresonance frequency is measured.\nIn conclusion, the present Letter aims to describe some\nof the evolution of the vibrating tip-microlever system.\nHere we focus on shifts of the resonance frequency that\nhave been shown to be able to record images with the\natomic resolution. The theoretical description is able to\npredict the variation of the resonance frequency as a\nfunction of the tip-surface distance. It also shows that\na linear analysis cannot account for the frequency shift\nvariation and thus will be unable to explain the large\nchange of the resonance frequency when the tip-sample\ndistance is slightly varied.\nThis paper also shows that there is no need to introduce\nparticular short range forces to explain the way the shifts\nof the resonance frequency is varying as a function of\nthe tip-sample distance. In other words, depending on\nthe surface investigated, the observed contrast at the\natomic scale could be an image of tiny variations of the\nfluctuating forces. Also we show that because of the high-\n\nQ values used in the NC-AFM experiments distortion of\nthe resonant peak always occurs.\nWe have benefited from many discussions with the\nparticipants of the Workshop NC-AFM '98. Particularly,\nit is a pleasure for one of us to thank Dr. A. Schwarz\nfor many illuminating discussions and Dr. F. Giessibl for\ngiving us a preprint prior to publication.\n\n*Email address: jpaime@frbdx11.cribx1.u-bordeaux.fr\n[1] Y. Martin, C. C. Williams, and H. K. Wickramasinghe,\nJ. Appl.
