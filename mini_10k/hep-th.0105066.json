One of the most interesting\ndirection was to study aspects of confinement in the M theory fivebrane version of QCD\n(MQCD) [2, 3]. The brane theory (MQCD) is not identical to QCD as it contains the\nKaluza-Klein modes from the compactified direction x10 and the radius of the direction\nx10 becomes an extra parameter. In [3], different aspects of N = 1 MQCD were studied,\nit was shown to have flux tubes and the tensions of MQCD strings and domain walls\nwere derived.\nOne question which arises is the following: MQCD results were based on studying\nthe M5 brane obtained by lifting a brane configuration with D4 branes between two\northogonal NS5 branes. The gauge theory of the latter is U(N) if we have N D4 branes\nwhereas the gauge theory on the M5 brane is SU(N) and the two coincide in the extreme\nIR because the U(1) is asymptotically free and decouples, but away from IR the field\ntheory on the M5 brane is SU(N). We can then ask what happens to the U(1) group \u2212\ndo we lose all the information about it or can we recover the information in some limits?\nTo answer that, we will inspire ourselves from the recent results about large N dualities\nof [5].\nRecently, important results have been obtained concerning field theories on partially wrapped D-branes over non-trivial cycles of non-compact geometries. In particular, based on the Chern-Simons/topological strings duality [4], Vafa suggested that\nD-branes wrapped over cycles have a dual description where the D-branes have disappeared and have been replaced by fluxes after transition in geometry [5]. This duality\ncan be explained as a geometric flop in M theory on a G2 holonomy manifold [8, 7].\nOther developments related to this duality in 10 and 11 dimensions were discussed in\n[10, 11, 6, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18] and in the presence of orientifold planes (besides\nthe D-branes) in [9, 14]. Vafa's duality considers strings and branes at conifold singularities which have been studied extensively in the recent years, starting with the\nwork of Klebanov-Witten [19] and generalized to include quotient conifold singularities\n[20, 21, 22], nonconformal field theories [23, 25] and theories with non-commutative\nmoduli spaces [26].\nWe will be able to motivate, from the discussions related to the brane configurations\nfor conifolds, the important result that for N D5 branes on P1 cycle of a resolved conifold,\nin the limit when the cycle is of very small size there is a transition from the U(N)\ntheories on the branes to U(1) theory. This is because there is a T-dual picture for the\nresolved conifold which implies a configuration with N D4 branes on an interval between\ntwo orthogonal NS5 branes which can be lifted to a single M5 brane and is the starting\n1\n\n\fpoint of the MQCD discussion. What happens in M theory when the size of the P1\nbecomes small? The result, as we shall show, is that in this case the curve M5 brane\nsplits into a set of N \"plane\" M5 branes located at a specific point in the x10 direction.\nAlso now on each planar M5 branes we have a N = 1, U(1) field theory. From where are\nthe U(1) groups coming from? They come exactly from the U(1) which was decoupled\nin the initial step of going from U(N) to SU(N). As explained in [3], the U(1) were\ndecoupled because it had an infinite kinetic energy. What we show now is that in the\nlimit of small size P1 cycle, the energy becomes finite so it makes sense to reconsider\nthe U(1) groups.\nThis also tells us that in the limit of small P1 cycle, one has to reconsider the issue of\nconfinement and chiral symmetry breaking. In [3], the issue was treated for pure QCD\nand the result was that different vacua were obtained for different curved M5 branes,\nthe theory had a mass gap and the N vacua rotated by Z2N . In our case, we have\ncondensation but still have massless particle after condensation because we have the\nU(1) groups on the plane M5 branes and the group Z2N rotates different U(1) theories\nlocated on the different plane M5 branes. We also obtain an interpretation of the domain\nwalls and QCD strings in the small P1 limit.\nWe can now return and ask if our transition can be seen as an M theory lift of the\nlarge N geometrical transition. This could be an alternative to the one involving G2\nmanifolds [8, 7]. We see that the plane M5 branes reduce to a type IIA configuration\nwhich is T-dual to the deformed conifold with flux through the S3 cycle. The fluxes are\ndue to bending of the planar M5 branes along the x10 direction implying a change in\nmetric. In 10 dimensions this reduces to a configuration of two intersecting NS5 branes\nwith a two-form flux whose T-dual is our required configuration.\n\n2\n\nT-dual description of Vafa's N = 1 Duality\n\nIn type IIA string theory, a four dimensional N = 1, U(N) supersymmetric gauge theory\nis obtained by wrapping N D6 branes on the S3 in a complex deformed conifold (we will\nsimply call it a deformed conifold):\nxy \u2212 uv \u2212 \u03bc = 0\n\n(1)\n\nwhich is isomorphic to T \u2217 S3 as a symplectic manifold after the rotation of symplectic\nstructure by the phase of \u03bc. In [5], Vafa has proposed a duality, in the large N limit, between this theory and type IIA superstrings without D\u2013branes propagating on a K\u00e4hler\ndeformed conifold which is a small resolution of the conifold (we will call it a resolved\nconifold). Recall that the resolved conifold is obtained by replacing the singular point\n2\n\n\fof the conifold by a rigid P1 with normal bundle O(\u22121) + O(\u22121). By the definition of\nP1 , each point p of P1 represents a complex line Lp and O(\u22121) (a.k.a. the tautological\nline bundle) over P1 is the complex line bundle on P1 with fiber Lp over p \u2208 P1 , and\nO(\u22121) + O(\u22121) is the direct sum of two copies of the O(\u22121). Moreover, it can be seen\nfrom the toric description of the resolved conifold that the resolved conifold is the same\nas the total space of the bundle O(\u22121) + O(\u22121) over P1 .\nThe large N duality, which emerges from the embedding of the large N Chern\u2013\nSimons/ topological string duality of Gopakumar and Vafa [4] in ordinary superstrings,\nstates that N = 1 U(N) theory on the deformed conifold is dual to type IIA theory\non the resolved conifold. In this duality, the branes disappear and are replaced by N\nunits of RR flux through P1 , and NS flux through the fibers of the normal bundle\nO(\u22121) + O(\u22121). The complexified K\u00e4hler parameter t of P1 is related to the volume V\nof the S3 and the string coupling constant by:\n(et \u2212 1)N = exp(\u2212V /gs )\n\n(2)\n\nWe note that when S3 has a large volume V and when the 't Hooft coupling NgY2 M is\nsmall, the K\u00e4hler parameter t \u2192 0 and the good description is the one with wrapped\nD-branes, whose worldvolume decouples from the bulk and we use the open strings\nending on the D-branes. When the K\u00e4hler parameter t >> 0, the blown-up description\nis good and the wrapped D-brane picture is bad because then the volume of S3 should\nbe negative. In this case we use the close strings whose low-energy sector is given by\nsupergravity. The SU(N) gauge theory decouples from the bulk when the size t of the\n1\n\u03b1\nblown-up P1 is small and t is identified with the glueball superfield S = \u2212 32\u03c0\n2 T rW\u03b1 W\nof the SU(N) theory, its expectation value corresponding to gaugino condensation in\nthe SU(N) theory.\nIn the mirror description, the U(N) theory is obtained from type IIB D5 wrapped on\nthe rigid P1 in the resolved conifold and, in the large N limit, this is equivalent to type\nIIB on the deformed conifold (1) with RR flux on the S 3 . The deformation parameter \u03bc\nwill be identified with the SU(N) glueball superfield S. Rather than the N original D5\nbranes, there are now N units of RR flux through S 3 , and also some NS flux through\nthe fiber of the cotangent bundle T \u2217 S3 . Moreover, by integrating the holomorphic three\nform over the three cycle S3 and its dual cycle in T \u2217 S3 , one obtains the superpotential\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\nWeff = S log \u039b3N /S N + NS,\n\n(3)\n\nand the N vacua of SU(N) N = 1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills:\n< S >= exp(2\u03c0ik/N)\u039b3 .\n\n(4)\n\nHence the large N duality arises from a geometric transition from the resolved conifold\nto the deformed conifold. We now take T dual of this geometric transition and later we\n3\n\n\fwill consider the lifting to the M-theory. We begin by introducing a circle action on the\nconifold and extend it to the resolved conifold and the deformed conifold in a compatible\nmanner. Consider an action Sc on the conifold xy \u2212 uv = 0:\nSc : (ei\u03b8 , x) \u2192 x, (ei\u03b8 , y) \u2192 y (ei\u03b8 , u) \u2192 ei\u03b8 u, (ei\u03b8 , v) \u2192 e\u2212i\u03b8 v,\n\n(5)\n\nThe orbits of the action Sc degenerates along the union of two intersecting complex lines\ny = u = v = 0 and x = u = v = 0 on the conifold. Now, if we take a T-dual along the\ndirection of the orbits of the action, there will be NS branes along these degeneracy loci as\nargued in [24]. So we have two NS branes which are spaced along x (i.e. y = u = v = 0)\nand y directions (i.e. x = u = v = 0) together with non-compact direction along the\nMinkowski space which will be denoted by NSx and NSy .\nThis action can be lifted to the resolved conifold. To do that, we consider two copies\nof C3 with coordinates Z, X, Y (resp. Z \u2032 , X \u2032 , Y \u2032 ) for the first (resp. second) C3 . Then\nO(\u22121) + O(\u22121) over P1 is obtained by gluing two copies of C3 with the identification:\nZ\u2032 =\n\n1\n,\nZ\n\nX \u2032 = XZ ,\n\nY\u2032 = YZ .\n\n(6)\n\nThe Z (resp. Z \u2032 ) is a coordinate of P1 in the first (resp. second) C3 and others are\nthe coordinates of the fiber directions. The blown-down map from the resolved conifold\nC3 \u222a C3 to the conifold C is given by\nx = X = X \u2032 Z \u2032 , y = ZY = Y \u2032 , u = ZX = X \u2032 , v = Y = Z \u2032 Y \u2032 .\n\n(7)\n\nFrom this map, one can see that the following action Sr on the resolved conifold is an\nextension of the action Sc (5):\nSr : (ei\u03b8 , Z) \u2192 ei\u03b8 Z, (ei\u03b8 , X) \u2192 X, (ei\u03b8 , Y ) \u2192 e\u2212i\u03b8 Y\n(ei\u03b8 , Z \u2032 ) \u2192 e\u2212i\u03b8 Z \u2032 , (ei\u03b8 , X \u2032 ) \u2192 ei\u03b8 X \u2032 , (ei\u03b8 , Y \u2032 ) \u2192 Y \u2032\n\n(8)\n\nThe orbits degenerates along the union of two complex lines Z = Y = 0 in the first\ncopy of C3 and Z \u2032 = Y \u2032 = 0 in the second copy of C3 . Note that these two lines do\nnot intersect and in fact they are separated by the size of P1 . Now we take T-dual\nalong the orbits of Sr of type IIB theory obtained by wrapping N D5 branes on the\nrigid P1 . Again there will be two NS branes along the degeneracy loci of the action: one\nNS brane, denoted by NSX , spaced along X direction (which is defined by Z = Y = 0\nin the first C3 ) and the other NS brane, denoted by NSY \u2032 along Y \u2032 direction (which is\ndefined by Z \u2032 = X \u2032 = 0 in the second C3 ). Therefore the T-dual picture will be a brane\nconfiguration of D4 brane along the interval with two NS branes in the 'orthogonal'\ndirection at the ends of the the interval. Here the length of the interval is the same as\nthe size of the rigid P1 . As the rigid P1 shrinks to zero, the size of the interval goes to\nzero and NSX (resp. NSY \u2032 ) approaches to NSx (resp. NSy ) of the conifold.\n4\n\n\fFinally we will provide a circle action of the deformed conifold and a T dual picture\nunder this action. Consider the following circle action Sd\n(ei\u03b8 , x) \u2192 x, (ei\u03b8 , y) \u2192 y, (ei\u03b8 , u) \u2192 ei\u03b8 u, (ei\u03b8 , v) \u2192 e\u2212i\u03b8 v,\n\n(9)\n\non the deformed conifold\nxy \u2212 uv = \u03bc\n\n(10)\n\nThen Sd is clearly the extension of Sk (8) and the orbits of the action degenerate along a\ncomplex curve u = v = 0 on the deformed conifold. If we take a T-dual of the deformed\nconifold along the orbits of Sk , we obtain a NS brane along the curve u = v = 0 with\nnon-compact direction in the Minkowski space which is given by\nxy = \u03bc\n\n(11)\n\nin the x-y plane. Topologically, the curve (11) is R1 \u00d7 S1 . In the T-dual picture, the\nlarge N duality is achieved via a transition from the brane configuration of N coincident\nD4 branes between two 'orthogonal' NS branes to the brane configuration of a single NS\nbrane wrapped on R1 \u00d7 S1 with gauge fields A\u03bc (which will be discussed in section 6).\n\n3\n\nMQCD Transition\n\nTo investigate the large N limit for a small P1 , we appeal to Witten's MQCD M5 brane\nof the brane configuration of the resolved conifold constructed in the previous section.\nIn MQCD [3], the classical type IIA brane configuration turns into a single fivebrane\nwhose world-volume is a product of the Minkowski space R1,3 and a complex curve in a\nflat Calabi-Yau manifold\nM = C2 \u00d7 C\u2217 .\n\n(12)\n\nRecall that the T-dual brane configuration of N D5 branes wrapped on the rigid P1 in\nthe resolved conifold is the N D4 branes on the interval together with two NS branes\nNSX , NSY \u2032 at the ends. We denote the coordinate of the interval by x7 and the angular\ncoordinate of the circle S1 in the 11-th dimension by x10 . After we combine them into\na complex coordinate\nt = exp(\u2212R\u22121 x7 \u2212 ix10 )\n\n(13)\n\nwhere R is the radius of the circle S1 in the 11-th dimension, the world-volume of the\nM-theory fivebrane (a.k.a. M5 brane), corresponding to the brane configuration of the\n5\n\n\fresolved conifold, is given R1,3 \u00d7 \u03a3 where \u03a3 is a complex curve defined by, up to an\nundetermined constant \u03b6\ny = \u03b6x\u22121 , t = xN\n\n(14)\n\nin M Here we are using x, y instead of X, Y \u2032 anticipating the identification after the\ntransition and we will call \u03a3 a M5 curve. The equations (14) should be understood as\nan embedding of the punctured x plane C\u2217 into the Calabi-Yau space M by the map\nC\u2217 \u2212\u2192 \u03a3 \u2282 M,\n\nx \u2192 (x, \u03b6x\u22121 , xN )\n\n(15)\n\nHence \u03a3 is a rational curve and wraps around the punctured t plane C\u2217 \u2282 M N times\nwhich reflects the fact that there are N coincident D4 branes along the x7 direction in\nType IIA.\nNow if we consider the limit where the size of P1 goes to zero, then the x7 direction\nin the M-theory will be very small and negligible. The modulus of t on \u03a3 will be fixed i.e.\n\u03a3 will be a curve in the cylinder S1 \u00d7C2 where S1 is the circle in the 11-th dimension and\nC2 are coordinatized by x, y. In fact, the value of t on \u03a3 must be constant because \u03a3 is\nholomorphic and there is no non-constant holomorphic map into S1 . The holomorphicity\nis required because of supersymmetry. Therefore the M5 curve make a transition from\na \"space\" curve into a \"plane\" curve. From (14), we obtain two relation on t and t\u22121\nt = xN , t\u22121 = \u03b6 \u2212N y N .\n\n(16)\n\nSo there are N possible plane curves which the M5 space curve \u03a3 can be reduced to:\n\u03a3k :\n\nt = t0 , xy = \u03b6 exp 2\u03c0ik/N,\n\nk = 0, 1, . . . , N \u2212 1.\n\n(17)\n\nAlternatively we may consider these as N possible relations between x and y on \u03a3 after\neliminating t because the dimension of t on \u03a3 is virtually zero and the information along\nt is not reliable.\nSince this is the limit where gs N is big, this degenerate M5 brane should not be\nconsidered as a M theory lift of D branes. In this limit, the gravitationally deformed\nbackground without the D-branes is the right description and this is a closed string\ngeometric background. If one looks at the T dual picture of the deformed conifold (11),\nthis is exactly M theory lift of the NS brane of the deformed conifold! The size of S3\non the deformed conifold depends on the expectation value for the gluino condensation\nand, for each value of the gluino condensate we will have a different flux through the S3\ncycle. We may intuitively consider the plane M5 as one obtained from two intersecting\nM5 branes by smearing out the intersection point due to the flux from the vanished D4\nbranes wrapped on P1 .\n6\n\n\fThe plane M5 branes (17) describe N different U(1) theories with fluxes related to\neach other by exp(2\u03c0i/N) after the SU(N) group gets a mass gap. These N different\nU(1)'s are just N different vacua for the same theory, each obtained for a specific choice\nof < S >. The vacuum expectation values of the glueball superfield S are then read to\nbe:\n< S >= exp(2\u03c0ik/N)\u03b6\n\n(18)\n\nwhich agrees with the field theory result since \u03b6 \u223c N\u039b3 and also with [32, 34, 35]. The\nN = 2 vector multiplet consists of a neutral N = 1 chiral superfield and N = 1 photon.\nThe N = 1 chiral superfield gets a mass due to the presence of fluxes and is identified\nwith S. So in MQCD, the large N duality occurs via a geometric transition from the\nspace M5 curve to the plane M5 curve. The 11-dimensional supergravity solutions for\nthis plane M5 curve have been studied in [28].\nBefore discussing the gauge theory on the plane M5 branes, let us consider the NS\n3-form flux which goes through the non-compact cycle dual to the compact S3 cycle of\nthe deformed conifold. After the T-duality, the S3 cycle translates into the waist of the\nNS brane xy = \u03b6, considered as a hyperboloid. The NS flux will be given by an integral\nof the holomorphic 1 form dz/z over a noncompact 1-cycle dual to the waist. As in [5],\nthe NS flux controls the size of the cycle that the D5 branes are wrapped on, in our\ncase the cycle being P1 . The cycle P1 is a rigid one, this being the necesary condition\nto turn a NS flux in the geometry. The size of the P1 cycle is related to the size of the\ninterval direction of the D4 branes which is related to the gauge coupling constant of the\nSU(N) theory. Therefore, the NS flux controls the magnitude of the coupling constant\nof the SU(N) theory.\n\n4\n\nGauge theory on M5 brane\n\nIt has been shown that M5 brane (14) gives rise to SU(N) gauge theory and U(1) gauge\nfields are decoupled from the theory [3]. It is puzzling to see the massless U(1) photons\nafter the transition. To understand this phenomenon better, we recall the low energy\neffective four-dimensional theory from M5 brane derived in [2]. Consider in general a\nfivebrane whose world-volume is R1,3 \u00d7\u03a3 where \u03a3 is a compact Riemann surface of genus\ng. According to [29, 30], in the effective four-dimensional description, the zero modes\nof the antisymmetric tensor give g Abelian gauge fields on R4 . The coupling constants\nand theta parameters of the g Abelian gauge fields are described by a rank g Abelian\nvariety which is the Jacobian J(\u03a3). Let\nT = F \u2227 \u039b + \u2217F \u2227 \u2217\u039b,\n7\n\n(19)\n\n\fwhere F is a two-form on R4 , \u039b is a one-form on \u03a3, and \u2217 is the Hodge star. This T is self\ndual, and the equation of motion dT = 0 gives Maxwell's equations dF = d\u2217F = 0 along\nwith the equations d\u039b = d \u2217 \u039b = 0 for \u039b. So \u039b is harmonic one-form and every choice\nof a harmonic one-form \u039b gives a way of embedding solutions of Maxwell's equations on\nR4 as a solution of the equations for the self-dual three-form T .\nWe now consider n + 1 parallel Type IIA NS branes joined by D4 branes. The M5\nbrane world-volume will be of the form R1,3 \u00d7 \u03a3. The \u03a3 is obtained by joining n + 1\ncopies of C by Nk tubes C\u2217 between k-th and (k + 1)-th C. By adding (n + 1) points,\nP\nthe \u03a3 can be compactified into a compact Riemann surface \u03a3 of genus g = nk=1(Nk \u2212 1)\nas was shown in [2]. A Jacobian (or quasi-Albanese) of a non-compact Riemann surface\ncan be defined in terms of its mixed Hodge structure [31]. For the Riemann surface \u03a3,\nthe Jacobian J(\u03a3) fits into an exact sequence of algebraic groups:\n1 \u2212\u2192 (C\u2217 )n \u2212\u2192 J(\u03a3) \u2212\u2192 J(\u03a3) \u2212\u2192 0\n\n(20)\n\nwhere J(\u03a3) is the usual Jacobian of the compactification \u03a3 of \u03a3. This exact sequence\ndoes not split in general as the Jacobian J(\u03a3) represents a non-trivial elements of\nExt(J(\u03a3), (C\u2217 )n ). In the effective action for the four dimensional gauge theory, the harmonic forms from the non-compact partR (C\u2217 )n decouples from the theory because the\ncorresponding M5 brane kinetic energy R1,3 \u00d7\u03a3 |T |2 becomes infinity as the non-trivial\nharmonic one form d log z on C\u2217 is not square-integrable [2]. Thus the low energy effecQ\ntive action is determined by J(\u03a3) and the gauge group is nk=1 SU(Nk ). On the other\nhand, according to the large N duality proposal of [6], the gauge theory becomes U(1)n\nafter the transition and it agrees with U(1)n theory from U(N) theory after the SU(Ni )\ngets a mass gap and confine in the breaking\nU(N) \u2192\n\nn\nY\n\nU(Nk ).\n\n(21)\n\nk=1\n\nHence after the transition, the coupling from the non-compact part (C\u2217 )n of the Jacobian\nJ(\u03a3) has been restored. From the M-theory point of view, the large N duality is a\ntransition from the compact part J(\u03a3) to the non-compact part (C \u2217 )n of the Jacobian\nQ\nJ(\u03a3). So there will be a duality between nk=1 SU(Nk ) and U(1)n and the former will be\ndescribed by the space M5 curve and the latter will be described by the plane M5 curve.\nIn this paper we will deal with the simplest case of n = 1 and more complicated case\n(n > 1) will be dealt in [42]. As the P1 gets smaller, there will be gaugino condensation\nin SU(Nk ) theory, the decoupled U(1) will be restored back into the picture.\nTo see this more precisely, let us consider the case of N D5 brane wrapping P1 in\nthe resolved conifold for simplicity (the arguments for the general case is similar). After\nthe transition, the plane M5 curve will be given by \u03a3 : xy = \u03b6 in the x-y plane which\nis C\u2217 . But it is wrong to use the flat metric for C\u2217 here. This M5 was obtained from\n8\n\n\ftwo NS, say NSx , NSy , branes by collapsing the P1 cycle. Hence for large values of x,\nthe metric on M5 curve will be like that of NSx and for small values of x, the metric on\nM5 curve will be like that of NSy at large value of y since two NS branes are smeared\nout at the intersection point. The metric on M5 is nothing but the induced metric from\nthe flat metric on the x-y plane which is the 11 dimensional metric in our M theory.\nEven though for such a metric, the integral \u03a3 d log x \u2227 \u2217d log x is still divergent,\nnow we can regulate the infinity to obtain finite period by putting a cutoff, thus using\nthe same argument for cutoff as in [6]. Because |\u03b6| has dimension 3, |x| and |y| have\n3/2\ndimensions 3/2. By putting the cutoff at |x| = \u039b0 , the integral\nR\n\nZ\n\n\u03a3\n\nd log x \u2227 \u2217d log x \u223c 2\n\nZ\n\n3/2\n\u039b0 >|x|>|\u03b6|1/2\n\ndx \u2227 dx\u0304/|x|2\n\n(22)\n\n= 3 log \u039b0 \u2212 log |\u03b6|\nbecomes finite and these harmonic one forms are exactly captured by the non-compact\npart (C\u2217 )n of the Jacobian J(\u03a3). We observe that the IR divergency of the integral is\nremoved because of |\u03b6| so the only necessary cutoff is in the UV.\nHence the decoupled U(1) gauge fields will be restored after the transition. In view\nof this, it seems to be reasonable to assume that there is a MQCD theory associate to\nQ\nthe Jacobian J(\u03a3) which is a nk=1 U(Nk ) gauge theory and is not broken to U(1)n \u00d7\nQn\nk=1 SU(Nk ) since the exact sequence (20) does not split in general.\nFrom (22) we can extract the coupling constant for the theory as:\n1\n\u223c 3 log \u039b0 \u2212 log |\u03b6|\ng2\n\n(23)\n\nwhich is the expected running of the coupling constant for D = 4, N = 1 Yang-Mills\ntheory if we replace the cutoff \u039b0 by the scale of the gauge theory, denoted by \u039b. The\ncoupling constant of U(1) theory is 1/N of the coupling constant for U(N) theory.\nThere is also a discrete Z2 symmetry of exchanging x and y\nx \u2192 y, y \u2192 x , t \u2192 \u03b6 N t\u22121\n\n(24)\n\nreverses the orientation of strings stretched between different D4 branes. This Z2 symmetry corresponds to the exchange of two factors of O(\u22121) in the O(\u22121) + O(\u22121) over\nP1 combined with the involution w \u2192 w \u2032 on P1 which is an exact symmetry of the\nvacuum.\n\n9\n\n\f5\n\nDomain Walls and QCD Strings\n\nConfinement is one of the most mysterious and puzzling aspects of QCD. Assuming that\nN = 1 MQCD is in the same universality class as QCD [3], we can study some aspects\nof QCD strings. As a consequence of having N different vacua after the transition, there\ncan be domain walls separating different vacua. In the large N limit, they behave as M5\nbranes where the QCD strings can end [3].\nRecall that the vacua are described by N plane M5 curves:\n\u03a3k :\n\nt = t0 , xy = \u03b6 exp 2\u03c0ik/N,\n\nk = 0, 1, . . . , N \u2212 1.\n\n(25)\n\nA domain wall is a physical situation that for one region of x3 looks like one vacuum\nof the theory and for another region of x3 looks like another vacuum. Here x3 is one\nof the three spatial coordinates in R1,3 and the physics should be independent of the\ntime x0 and the other two spatial coordinates x1 , x2 . For convenience, we compactify x3\ndirection into a circle x3 from now one and use the angular coordinate \u03b8 for the phase of\nS1 . So we are assuming that we have the same physics at x3 \u2192 \u221e and x3 \u2192 \u2212\u221e. In M\ntheory, such a physical situation can be realized as a fivebrane that interpolates between\nthe N plane M5 curves \u03a3k describing different vacua. Therefore we consider a fivebrane\nof the form R3 \u00d7 D where R3 is parameterized by x0 , x1 , x2 , and D is a three-surface\nin the seven manifold M\u0303 = S1 \u00d7 M where S1 is parameterized by \u03b8, 0 \u2264 \u03b8 < 2\u03c0. We\ndefine D in M\u0303 with fixed t as\nt = t0 , xy = \u03b6 exp(i\u03b8).\n\n(26)\n\nWe have a smooth family of holomorphic curves parameterized by \u03b8 in M\u0303 . Since it is\nlocally diffeomorphic to a product of R and a Riemann surface, it is supersymmetric.\nFor \u03b8 = 2\u03c0k/N, k = 0, . . . , N \u2212 1, the three-surface D will be a holomorphic curve \u03a3k\nwhich describes the N = 1 U(1) supersymmetric Yang Mills with vacua of the glueball\nsuperfield S of the SU(N) theory. Hence this is the domain wall connecting N = 1 U(1)\ntheory with all possible different vacua.\nRecall that the vacua are described by N plane M5 curves \u03a3k :\nt = t0 , xy = \u03b6 exp(2\u03c0ik/N), k = 0, . . . , N \u2212 1\n\n(27)\n\nin M. We now define QCD strings as open oriented onebrane Ck in M with fixed t:\nt = t0 ,\nx =\ny =\n\n(28)\n\n1/N\nt0 exp(2\u03c0i(k\n\u22121/N\n\u03b6t0\n.\n\n10\n\n+ \u03c3)/N),\n\n\fThe curve Ck connects two vacua \u03a3k and \u03a3k+1 . As a topological object, they are\nclassified as the element of a relative homology H1 (M, \u222a\u03a3k , Z). The relative homology\nfits into a long exact sequence:\n. . . \u2192 H1 (\u222a\u03a3k , Z) \u2192 H1 (M, Z) \u2192 H1 (M, \u222a\u03a3k , Z)\u2192H0 (\u222a\u03a3k , Z) \u2192 . . .\n\n(29)\n\nUsing this sequence and topological properties of \u03a3k and Y , it can be shown that\nH1 (M, \u222a\u03a3k , Z) \u223c\n= Zn .\n\n(30)\n\nThe N of Ck will annihilate as an element of H1 (M, Z) i.e. they can be detached from\n\u222a\u03a3k as the boundaries add up to zero and will form a long closed string in M and can\nbe deformed into a point. By construction, all of the QCD strings lie entirely in the\ndomain wall D and hence stable.\nRecently, the BPS domain wall of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory for arbitrary\ngauge theory has been studied [33]. For SU(N) group, the M-theory formulation on G2\nholonomy geometry has been used. It would be desirable to see the results of [33] from\nthe MQCD set-up as above.\n\n6\n\nBrane Construction from Fluxes\n\nSo far we've studied the large N transition purely from M-theory point of view. What\nhappens in string theory? In this section we shall provide an intuitive understanding\nof the large N duality using type IIA brane constructions. But before we dwell into\nthat we need some more details on the conifold. As was shown in the previous sections,\nthe T dual of type IIB theory on a conifold can be regarded as two NS5 branes at a\npoint x6 = x7 = 0. The distance between the two NS5 branes along x7 is given by\nthe resolution of a conifold and the distance along x6 is given by the value of BN SN S\nfield on the vanishing two cycles of the base sphere in the T-dual model. The latter\ncan be shown easily if we have some D4 branes along the compact direction x6 and also\nstretched along x0,1,2,3 . The distance between the NS5\nbranes determines the 3 + 1 d\nR\ngauge coupling which in turn is determined by the BN SN S over the two cycle S 2 of\nthe base of the conifold. If we have both the situation, namely, a resolved conifold with\nsome BN SN S flux through the two cycles then the T-dual picture is given by two NS5\nbranes separated along a distance z0 in a complex z = x6 + ix7 plane.\nThe S 3 of the base is a Hopf fibration of a circle on a sphere S 2 . The circle, whose\ncoordinates we specify as \u03c8 is non trivially twisted over the base S 2 . This twist can\nbe seen to come from the NS5 brane charges in the T-dual picture. To make this\n11\n\n\fconnection precise we first make an identification of the brane coordinates xn with the\nconifold coordinates \u03b8i , \u03c6j , \u03c8. For simplicity we can have the following identifications:\ndx4,8 \u2192 sin \u03b81,2 d\u03c61,2 ,\n\ndx5,9 \u2192 d\u03b81,2\n\n(31)\n\nIn these units the magnitude of the two BN SN S fields Bi satisfy4 the equation\n1\n\u2202\n(sin\u03b8i Bi ) = constant\nsin\u03b8i \u2202\u03b8i\n\n(32)\n\nwhose solutions are given by cot \u03b81 and cot \u03b82 . Thus the non trivial twist of the cycle \u03c8\non the base is governed by the metric\nds2 = (d\u03c8 + cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 + cos \u03b82 d\u03c62 )2\n\n(33)\n\nHere \u03c8 = x6 . There are also two Si2 , i = 1, 2 whose metric is given by the usual polar\ncoordinates\n2\nX\n\n(d\u03b8i2 + sin2 \u03b8i d\u03c62i )\n\n(34)\n\ni=1\n\nHowever it turns out that in homology, the S 2 factor in S 2 \u00d7 S 3 is the difference of the\ntwo S 2 's parameterized by \u03b81 , \u03c61 and \u03b82 , \u03c62 respectively. To see this observe that we can\nwrite two 2-forms\nsin \u03b81 d\u03b81 d\u03c61 \u00b1 sin \u03b82 d\u03b82 d\u03c62\n\n(35)\n\nboth of which live on the two S 2 factors and are independent of the U(1) fiber.\nBoth of these 2-forms can be written formally as exact forms, namely the above\nexpressions are equal to\nd(cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 \u00b1 cos \u03b82 d\u03c62 )\n\n(36)\n\nHowever, the expressions in brackets above are ill-defined when any of the \u03b8i is equal to\n0 or \u03c0, since in that case we are at the north or south pole of one of the 2-spheres and\nthe coordinate \u03c6i is undefined there. However, the term in the + sign can be modified\nto:\nd(d\u03c8 + cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 + cos \u03b82 d\u03c62 ) \u223c de\u03c8\n4\n\n(37)\n\nThere are various B-fields in the model. The Bi 's discussed here are the sources of the two NS5\nbranes. We take BR1 \u2261 B64 and B2 \u2261 B68 only as it is easy to show that the other components can be\ngauged away. The BN SN S field discussed above is a flux through the two cycle.\n\n12\n\n\fwhere e\u03c8 is one of the five vielbeins given in appendix (A) of Ref. [36], and is globally\ndefined because \u03c8 is allowed to have gauge transformations. It follows that the term\nwith the + sign in eq. (35) is genuinely exact, leaving the one with the minus sign as\nthe representative of the second cohomology. From this the above claim follows.\nNow, with the above back-ground, let us try to understand this duality from our\nbrane construction. However there is a small subtlety here. The brane construction\nthat we use here for deformed conifold is an approximation because the derivation relies\non the fact that some of the directions are actually de-localized. Therefore the brane\nconstruction for deformed conifold, in this section, should be regarded as for de-localized\nbranes. The exact brane construction is been derived in sec. 2 which takes only localized\nbranes. But since for completely localized branes we do not know how to calculate the\nexact supergravity metric we, for the purpose of this section only, take the approximate\nframework. Also, as it will be clear soon, we need only the brane construction for the\nconifold with S 3 \u2192 0.\nWe start with the deformed conifold with RR flux on the S 3 . For simplicity we shall\nassume that the total flux is constant. Now let us shrink the S 3 cycle to zero size. In\nthe limit when the cycle has shrunk to zero size then the resulting manifold is a singular\nvariety and is our old friend conifold.\nThe T-dual of this process is known. As we discussed in sec. 2, the T-dual of a\ndeformed conifold is a set of two intersecting NS5 branes on a curve xy = \u03bc and in the\nlimit \u03bc \u2192 0 it is nothing but two NS5 branes intersecting at a point (which is, of course,\na 3 + 1 dimensional plane). But now this is not enough. Recall that in the IIB picture\nwe have a large HRR flux at the conifold point. The H field is on S 3 and has components\nH\u03c8\u03bc\u03bd where \u03bc, \u03bd are coordinates on the base sphere. The T-dual of H\u03c8\u03bc\u03bd gives us F\u03bc\u03bd\nin type IIA theory where F = dA, A being the RR gauge field. Therefore we have N\nunits of flux at the point where the two NS5 branes meet. It is important to ask what\ndirections do the \u03bc, \u03bd coordinates span. The coordinates \u03bc, \u03bd are on the base of S 3 . The\ncohomology of the S 3 is generated by the third cohomology H 3 (T 11 ) as:\ne\u03c8 \u2227 e\u03b81 \u2227 e\u03c61 \u2212 e\u03c8 \u2227 e\u03b82 \u2227 e\u03c62\n\n(38)\n\nwhere we have already defined e\u03c8 and e\u03b8i , e\u03c6i are defined in terms of the conifold variables\nas:\ne\u03b8i = d\u03b8i ,\n\ne\u03c6i = sin \u03b8i d\u03c6i , i = 1, 2\n\n(39)\n\nTherefore \u03bc, \u03bd span all the four directions x4,5,8,9 and hence F will have components\nalong both the spheres x4,5 and x8,9 .\nWhen the S 3 is shrunk to zero, we have, in the T-dual model, the two NS5 branes\nat the point x6 = x7 = 0 and the directions x4,5 and x8,9 of the NS5 branes wrapped on\n13\n\n\fvanishing spheres. This is a singular configuration (with flux per unit area approaching\ninfinity) and because of this a four-brane is created by a mechanism similar to the\nHanany \u2212 Witten effect[27]. To understand this let us recall some basic facts about the\nNS5 brane.\nOn the world volume of a NS5 brane there propagates a chiral (2, 0) tensor multiplet\nwhose fields are (Bij+ , 5\u03c6). B + is an anti-self dual two forms on the NS5 brane whose\ncoordinates are \u03c3 i,j and \u03c6i , i = 1, .., 5 are the five scalars. Two out of these five scalars\nare periodic. A simple way to see this would be as follows [37]:\nIf we T-dualize orthogonal to a de-localized NS5 brane of type IIA we shall get a\nconfiguration of Kaluza-Klein (KK) monopole in type IIB theory. As have been discussed\nin many previous works, the KK monopole supports a normalizable harmonic form which\nis anti self-dual. The four form of type IIB when reduced over this two-form gives rise\n+\nof the NS5 brane. The two B fields of type IIB BRR and BN SN S\nto the two form B\u03bc\u03bd\ngive the two periodic scalars on the NS5 brane. The other three scalars come from the\ntranslational zero modes of the KK monopole.\nThe background gauge field couples to the world volume of the NS5 brane through\nthe following coupling:\nZ\n\nA \u2227 \u2217d\u03c6 =\n\nZ\n\nF \u2227 C4\n\n(40)\n\nwhere dC4 = \u2217d\u03c6 is the six dimensional dual of a world volume periodic scalar. From\ntype IIB point of view this coupling can be motivated from the kinetic term of the H\nfields.\nBecause\nthere is a background expectation value of the gauge field, this will induce\nR\na source C4 on the world-volume of the NS5 brane. A generic source will break all\nsupersymmetry on the world volume. The susy preserving source will tell us that we\nhave a four-brane stretched between the two NS5 branes.\nAlong what direction should this D4 stretch? It can be argued that the four- brane\nshould be along x0,1,2,3 and x7 . Observe that in our model there are two orthogonal\ndirections x6 and x7 . The limit where S 3 is of zero size is, as we discussed above, when\nthe x4,5 and x8,9 spheres are of zero size and the branes are on top of each other. In the\ntype IIB T-dual model the conifold transition will tell us that we go to a non-singular\nconfiguration by growing a two-sphere. The branes should therefore be now separated\nalong x7 because this process is the T-dual of resolution in the conifold. Thus the final\nconfiguration will be a D4 stretched between two NS5 branes separated along x7 , which is\nprecisely the configuration that we discussed in detail in the previous sections. But this\nis nothing but the T-dual of a resolved conifold with a D5 wrapping the S 2 ! Observe\n14\n\n\fthat we have arrived at this duality by a transition via a singular configuration \u2212 a\nconifold transition.\nIn the discussion above we gave a physical picture to motivate the large N duality of\nVafa. One last thing is to see how from M-theory this transition could be understood.\nRecall that in M-theory we start in \"reverse\" order, i.e we start with a configuration of a\nsingle M5 brane coming from a N D4 branes between two orthogonal NS5 branes in type\nIIA theory. After the transition the space M5 branes become N \"planar\" M5 branes\nwhich are located at a particular position in x10 . What does an observer in d = 10 sees?\nThe two M5 which intersect at a point in x10 will appear as two intersecting NS5 branes\nsatisfying the equation xy = m\u03b6 where m is a constant factor. The bending along the\nx10 direction, which gives non trivial components of the metric, will appear as gauge\nfields A\u03bc in 10 dimensions. Again this is precisely the brane configuration we started\nwith in the beginning of this section.\nFinally, what about the U(1) fields? In the above discussions we have motivated\nthe U(1) fields as the one coming from the (2, 0) fields of M5 branes. Also we know\nfrom the large N duality that the U(1) gauge fields have their origin from type IIB four\nform reduced over holomorphic three form of the Calabi-Yau. How are they related?\nAs we discussed in some details the two form of M5 brane has its origin from the four\nform of type IIB. Using various dualities of NS5 brane to a Taub-NUT space and two\nintersecting NS5 branes to a conifold one can easily show that the two U(1) are the\nsame. This is how the transition from U(N) theory on the brane to U(1) theory on the\nbulk can be seen.\nBefore we end, one very interesting direction is to study the interpolation between\nthe supergravity solution corresponding to D5 branes wrapped on the P1 cycle of the\nresolved conifold and the one corresponding to fluxes on the S3 cycle of the deformed\nconifold 5 . On one side we have the results of [38, 39] for D5 branes wrapped on P1\nand on the other side we have results concerning the deformed conifold without fluxes\n[40, 41]. The work towards an interpolating solution is in progress.\n\n7\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nWe thank Rajesh Gopakumar, David Kutasov, Juan Maldacena, Carlos Nunez and\nAngel Uranga for helpful discussions.
