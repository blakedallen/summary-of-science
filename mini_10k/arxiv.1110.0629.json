On the theoretical side,\nmost of the work done until now in the field of percolation of\nrandom networks is done for lattice percolation [11\u201318]. The\nrandom stick networks are an important representative of continuum percolation [19\u201322]. Random stick percolation and\nlattice percolation fall into the same universality class having\nthe same critical exponents [21]. Previous studies established\nthat all systems fall on the same scaling function if dimensionality of the system, percolation rule, boundary conditions, and\naspect ratio are fixed [15]. In applications, aspect ratio of the\nrectangular system is the only variable parameter, e.g., geometry of transistor gate channel in the carbon nanotube transistors [4, 5]. The objective of the present paper is to describe\nin consistent way finite size scaling of average percolation\ndensity and standard deviation for the asymmetric rectangular stick systems with free boundaries. From general scaling\narguments one would expect that for all finite size systems\ntheir convergence is governed by an exponent \u22121/\u03bd [18]. For\ntwo-dimensional (2D) systems \u03bd = 4/3 [18]. Following initial Ziff's publication [13], Hovi and Aharony [14, 15] argued\nthat the irrelevant scaling variables in the renormalizationgroup treatment of percolation imply a slower leading-order\nconvergence of percolation probability to its infinite-system\nvalue, characterized by an exponent \u22121/\u03bd \u2212 \u03b8, whose value\nwas deducted from the Monte Carlo work of Stauffer to be\n\u03b8 \u2248 0.85 [11]. Further it was showed that for lattice percolation on the square system leading exponent of the average\nconcentration at which percolation first occurs is \u22121/\u03bd \u2212 \u03b8,\nwhere \u03b8 \u2248 0.9 [17]. All the previous studies were performed\nfor symmetric systems. We show that only in symmetric case\nthe exponent of average density is \u22121/\u03bd \u2212 \u03b8. In asymmetric\nsystems, we observe a leading \u22121/\u03bd exponent. Another quantity, the percolation probability at the percolation threshold in\n\n\u2217\n\nCorresponding author: milan.zezelj@ipb.ac.rs\n\nsymmetric bond percolating systems is size independent, i.e.,\nscale invariant [23]. Until now, this behavior is not observed\nin other types of random percolating systems. We will demonstrate that asymmetric systems can exhibit scale invariant behavior.\nIn this paper, we investigate finite size scaling of the asymmetric rectangular stick systems with free boundaries. Both\nfrom renormalization group considerations and in the simulations, we find that aspect ratio strongly influences scaling\nbehavior of the percolation probability distribution function\nmoments, i.e., average density of sticks at which percolation\nfirst occurs and variance of percolation probability distribution function. A generalized scaling function is introduced,\nwith aspect ratio dependent prefactors and constant exponents\nof the expansion. Finally, it is shown that percolation probability of the asymmetric infinite sticks system at the critical\nthreshold density agrees with Cardy's analytic formula [12].\nII. NUMERICAL METHOD FOR CALCULATION OF\nPERCOLATION PROBABILITY\n\nMonte Carlo simulations, coupled with an efficient cluster analysis algorithm and implemented on grid platform, are\nused to investigate the stick percolation [24\u201327]. We consider two dimensional (2D) systems with isotropically placed\nwidthless sticks. The sticks of unit length are randomly positioned and oriented inside the rectangular system of width\nLx and height Ly . Two sticks lie in the same cluster if they\nintersect. System percolates if two opposite boundaries are\nconnected with the same cluster. The aspect ratio r is defined\nas the length of the rectangular system in percolating direction\ndivided with the length in perpendicular direction. We define\nthe normalizedpsystem size as a square root of the rectangular area L = Lx Ly (geometric average), which represent\nthe length of the square system with the same area. The behavior of stick percolation is studied in terms of the number\nstick density n = N/L2 . The percolation threshold of infinite\nsystem is defined by the critical density nc \u2248 5.63726 [27].\nMonte Carlo simulations are performed for wide range of\nthe aspect ratios, 0.1 \u2264 r \u2264 10. In order to ensure the\nsame precision for small and large systems we collected more\nthan NMC = 109 Monte Carlo realizations for small systems L < 10, down to NMC = 107 for the largest system\n\n\f2\nL = 320. Using appropriate functions for fitting data and\nthe least squares fitting methods excellent fits were obtained\n(R2 > 0.9999) for all analyzed systems with L \u2265 16. Statistical errors for the calculations are estimated in conventional\nfashion using standard deviation [24].\nPercolation probability function RN,L,r , is the probability\nthat the system with N sticks, size L and aspect ratio r percolates. It is convenient to pass from the discrete percolation\nprobability function RN,L,r for N sticks to a probability function for arbitrary stick density n [27]\nRn,L,r =\n\n2\n\u221e\nX\n(nL2 )N e\u2212nL\nRN,L,r ,\nN!\n\n(1)\n\nwith percolation probability distribution function defined as\nPn,L,r = \u2202Rn,L,r /\u2202n. The average stick percolation density at which, for the first time, a percolating cluster connects\nboundaries of the system is\nhniL,r =\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nnPn,L,r dn =\n\n1\nL2\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(1 \u2212 RN,L,r ),\n\n(2)\n\nN =0\n\nwhere the last equality follows from integrating by parts. Another important parameter of probability distribution function,\nPn,L,r , is variance \u22062L,r = hn2 iL,r \u2212 hni2L,r , where hn2 iL,r\nis calculated as\nZ \u221e\n\u221e\n2 X\n(N +1)(1\u2212RN,L,r ). (3)\nhn2 iL,r = n2 Pn,L,r dn = 4\nL\n0\nN =0\n\nEquations (2) and (3) allow calculations of the first two moments directly from discrete percolation probability function\nRN,L,r . This is computationally more efficient since it avoids\ncalculation of function Rn,L,r with high resolution.\nIII. GENERALIZED SCALING FUNCTIONS FOR\nMOMENTS\n\nThe percolation probability function is related to the universal scaling function [15]\nRn,L,r = F (x\u0302, {\u0177i }, \u1e91).\n\n(4)\n\nThe arguments of the universal scaling function F are x\u0302 =\nA(n \u2212 nc )L1/\u03bd , \u0177i = Bi \u03c9i L\u2212\u03b8i , and \u1e91 = C ln(r), where\nA, {Bi }, and C are the nonuniversal metric factors, {\u03c9i } are\nthe irrelevant variables, and {\u03b8i } are the corrections to scaling exponents, (i = 1, 2, ...). Using free boundary conditions\nand considering two complementary systems: the sticks and\nempty space around the sticks, we can conclude that either the\nsticks percolate in one direction or the empty space percolates\nin the opposite direction:\nF (x\u0302, {\u0177i }, \u1e91) + F (\u2212x\u0302, {\u2212\u0177i }, \u2212\u1e91) = 1.\n\nF (x\u0302, {\u0177i }, \u1e91) = F (0, {0}, 0)+f0(x\u0302, \u1e91)+\n\n(5)\n\nTaking the derivative with respect to x\u0302, \u0177i , and \u1e91 and evaluating the derivatives at x\u0302 = \u0177i = \u1e91 = 0, (i.e., at n = nc , L \u2192\n\u221e, r = 1), we conclude that \u2202 m F/\u2202 x\u0302j \u2202 \u01771k1 ... \u2202 \u1e91 l 0 = 0, for\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nfi (x\u0302, \u1e91)\u0177i +....\n\ni=1\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the functions f0 (x\u0302, \u1e91) and fi (x\u0302, \u1e91) are defined by\nf0 (x\u0302, \u1e91) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n1 \u2202 j+l F\nj!l! \u2202 x\u0302j \u2202 \u1e91 l\n\nj,l=0\n\nN =0\n\nZ\n\nm even. Expanding the percolation probability function near\nthe critical point we find that\n\nx\u0302j \u1e91 l , for j + l odd,\n\n(7)\n\n0\n\nand\nfi (x\u0302, \u1e91) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n1 \u2202 j+l+1 F\nj!l! \u2202 x\u0302j \u2202 y\u02c6i \u2202 \u1e91 l\n\nx\u0302j \u1e91 l , for j + l even. (8)\n0\n\nj,l=0\n\nSince percolation probability distribution function Pn,L,r =\n\u2202Rn,L,r /\u2202n gives the probability distribution for a system of\nsize L and aspect ratio r to percolate for the first time at stick\ndensity n, we can define the moments of this distribution\nZ \u221e\n\u2202Rn,L,r\n(n \u2212 nc )k\n\u03bck =\ndn\n\u2202n\n0\nZ \u221e\n\u2202F\n= A\u2212k L\u2212k/\u03bd\nx\u0302k\ndx\u0302,\n(9)\n\u2202 x\u0302\n\u2212Anc L1/\u03bd\nSubstituting Eqs. (6)-(8) in Eq. (9) the kth moment scales as\n!\n\u221e\nX\n\u2212k/\u03bd\ngi (\u1e91)\u0177i + ... , (10)\n\u03bck ({\u0177i }, \u1e91) = L\ng0 (\u1e91) +\ni=1\n\nwhere we introduce general functions g. For odd k, g0 (\u1e91)\nis odd function and gi (\u1e91) are even functions of \u1e91. For even k,\ng0 (\u1e91) is even and gi (\u1e91) are odd functions. Therefore, observed\nparity of prefactors in respect to \u1e91 should be independent of\nthe type of the system.\nFrom Eq. (10) the scaling behavior of the hniL,r can be described with generalized moment scaling function with aspect\nratio dependent coefficients\nhniL,r = nc + L\u22121/\u03bd\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nai (r)L\u2212\u03b8i .\n\n(11)\n\ni=0\n\nwhere {\u03b8i } are the corrections to scaling exponents. The\nzeroth-order correction to exponent \u03b80 should be zero [18]. In\nanalogy to hniL,r , for variance \u22062L,r we introduce expansion\n\u22062L,r = L\u22122/\u03bd\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nbi (r)L\u2212\u03b8i .\n\n(12)\n\ni=0\n\nFrom Eq. 10 and the parity of g0 (\u1e91) and gi (\u1e91), for the zerothorder and the first-order prefactors for hniL,r and \u22062L,r near\nln(r) = 0 (i.e., \u1e91 = 0), we obtain approximate expressions for\na0 (r) \u2248 a0,0 ln(r) + a0,1 ln3 (r), a1 (r) \u2248 a1,0 + a1,1 ln2 (r),\nb0 (r) \u2248 b0,0 + b1,0 ln2 (r), b1 (r) \u2248 b1,0 ln(r) + b1,1 ln3 (r).\n\n\f3\n\n\u2212 1/\u03b3 \u2248\n\nln dR/dp|pc\n.\nln 1/b\n\n(13)\n\nFrom Fig 1, one can see that probability density Pnc ,L,r which\nis derivative of Rn,L,r at nc , is always larger for symmetric\nsystems than for asymmetric systems of the same size.

One observes that\nthe slope of percolation probability function increases with the\nincrease of the system size. The percolation probability function curves intersect approximately at nc . The fine behavior of\npercolation probability at nc will be discussed bellow. With\nthe increasing system size, the standard deviation of probability distribution function decreases to zero. Also, average\nstick percolation density hniL,r , which corresponds roughly\nto maximum of probability distribution function Pn,L,r , approaches to percolation threshold nc . For r < 1, hniL,r\nconverges to nc from below with increase of the system size\nL. The reason for this is that narrow finite systems will be\nspanned already at lower densities than nc . For r > 1, hniL,r\nconverges from above, while for symmetric systems (r = 1)\nis roughly centered at nc , see Fig 1. From Fig. 2, one can see\nthat average stick percolation density hniL,r for aspect ratio\nhigher than one is monotonically decreasing function of the\nsystem size L. Somewhat surprising, for aspect ratios lower\nthan one, hniL,r is not monotonic function and has local minimum, i.e., for small systems hniL,r is a decreasing function,\nwhich passes through nc , reaches a minimum and after that\nconverges to nc from below. In inset of Fig. 2, one can see\nthat for large system sizes all the curves show power law convergence to the percolation threshold nc with exponent \u22121/\u03bd,\nexcept in the symmetric case, i.e., r = 1, where exponent is\n\u22121/\u03bd \u2212 \u03b81 . Absolute values of the leading-order prefactors\nare the same for aspect ratios r and 1/r. Higher exponent of\nsymmetric systems comes from the basic physics of percolation that is connectedness. We can illustrate this using a simplified image of site percolation by introducing quantity R(p)\nas probability that the sites with occupancy p form a spanning path. The percolation probability R(p) and occupancy p\nare equivalent to the percolation probability function Rn,L,r\nand stick density n, respectively. In this image, a cell coming\nout of the renormalization (coarse graining) transformation is\noccupied only if it contains a set of sites that span this cell.\nThe universal scaling function in previous section reflects the\nfact that the probability of the spanning system at the percolation threshold R(pc ) remains unaltered under this transformation [18]. Therefore fixed point of this system, i.e., the critical\npercolation threshold, pc is satisfying relation pc = R(pc ).\nWe can expand the percolation probability around the percolation threshold pc , |R(p)\u2212R(pc )| \u2248 dR/dp|pc |p\u2212pc|. Also,\nif we renormalize lattice by a length factor b, close to pc , characteristic length changes as \u03be/b. Since \u03be \u223c |p \u2212 pc |\u2212\u03b3 , we\ncan write another relation, |R(p) \u2212 R(pc )|\u2212\u03b3 \u2248 |p \u2212 pc |\u2212\u03b3 /b,\nconnecting characteristic lengths before and after renormalization. From these two relations one can conclude that critical exponent should be\n\nfore, from Eq. (13), one expects higher absolute value of the\nexponent in symmetric compared to asymmetric systems. Another conclusion one can draw from this analysis, is that the\nobserved exponents are a result of the interplay of the characteristic length and the system shape. Usually, such behavior\nis attributed to a competition between two-dimensional and\nthree-dimensional (or one-dimensional and two dimensional),\ne.g., in Ising model for slab geometries, cf. Ref [28]. In this\nsystem we observe that there is sharp transition in nature of\nscaling when we pass from symmetric to asymmetric system,\nand a competition between exponents characteristic for symmetric and asymmetric systems.\n\nPn,L,r\n\nIV.

The\nzeroth-order prefactor is zero for symmetric system r = 1,\nand it is odd function on a logarithmic scale, i.e., a0 (r) =\n\u2212a0 (1/r). We have verified the obtained results by interpolation through symmetrizing data points (hniL,r + hniL,1/r )/2.\nThe fitting coefficients for prefactors ai,j are calculated using the least squares fitting methods and given in Table I, cf.\nFig. 3. Influence of higher order terms were comparable or\nsmaller than simulation data error and we could not extract\nthem with sufficient precision. For the first-order correction,\nwe obtain \u03b81 = 0.83(2) for r = 1, cf. Ref. [11, 13]. The residual aspect ratio dependence of \u03b81 cannot be further analyzed\nwithout provision of retaining the first two terms in Eq.

Prefactor b1 (r) passes through zero for r between 1/0.9 and 1/0.8 causing\nhigher error bars of \u03b81 .\n\nFinally, we investigate scaling behavior of percolation\nprobability at the percolation threshold (Rnc ,L,r ), using\nthe generalized scaling function Rnc ,L,r = Rnc ,L\u2192\u221e,r +\nc1 (r)/L + c2 (r)/L2 , cf. Ref. [17]. The results for prefactors c1 (r) and c2 (r) are shown in Fig. 5. For two limiting\ncases (r < 0.1 and r > 10), the prefactors are close to zero,\nwhat is consistent with behavior observed in Fig. 1. Between\nthese two limiting cases, one can observe that both prefactors\nare close to zero for r = 2.25(5). Furthermore, at this aspect ratio, we could not observe existence of the higher order\nterms. This means that at the percolation threshold percolation probability is the same for all the systems, independent\nof system size L, having the value Rnc ,r\u22482.25 \u2248 0.135. Scale\ninvariance, i.e., Rnc ,L,r = Rnc ,\u221e,r is already seen and intuitively understood for bond percolation in symmetric systems,\nwhere Rpc =0.5,r=1 = 1/2 is independent of system size L,\ncf. Ref. [23]. The reason for observed system size invariance\nof percolation probability at the threshold in the asymmetric\nstick system is existence of multiple zero of at least second\norder at this point in universal scaling function. Regarding\nvalue of percolation probability at the percolation threshold\nof infinite system, we find that Cardy's analytical model de-\n\n\f5\n\nRnc ,L,r prefactors\n\nrived for the lattice percolation describes simulation data, cf.\nFig. 5. The deviation between analytical value for lattice and\nMonte Carlo value for stick percolation is less than statistical error of the simulation data, i.e., less than 10\u22125 .

We find that\nthe zeroth-order prefactor of average percolation density is\nodd function with respect to ln(r). This explains the faster\nconvergence of average percolation density for symmetric\nsystems than expected from general scaling arguments. We\nalso observe that there is a characteristic aspect ratio for\nwhich percolation probability at the percolation threshold is\nsystem size independent. In addition, for infinite system, we\nfind that percolation probability at the critical threshold density shows excellent agreement with the Cardy's prediction\nfor lattice percolation. The presented results confirm that\ncontinuum percolation belongs to the same universality class\nas lattice percolation in the sense that value of percolation\nprobability at the threshold for infinitely large systems is the\nsame for lattice and continuum percolation. One should note\nthat a number of other features observed in this work should\nbe a common characteristic within the class, e.g., existence\nof the aspect ratio where the percolation probability at the\nthreshold is scale invariant and parity of the moments of the\npercolation probability distribution function. This opens up\nthe question of the particle shape influence on prefactors,\nweather it is possible to find systems where the observed\nbehaviors are more pronounced, and finally the question of\nthe general form of the prefactors for describing different\nsystems.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors acknowledge support by the Ministry of\nScience of the Republic of Serbia, under project No.\nON171017.
