group,\nAffine Hecke algebra.\n\nIntroduction The congruences between automorphic forms and their applications to number theory are a motivation to study the smooth representations of a\nreductive p-adic group G over an algebraically closed field R of any characteristic.\nThe purpose of the talk is to give a survey of some aspects of the theory of Rrepresentations of G. In positive characteristic, most results are due to the author;\nwhen proofs are available in the litterature (some of them are not !), references will\nbe given.\nA prominent role is played by the unipotent block which contains the trivial\nrepresentation. There is a finite list of types, such that the irreducible representations of the unipotent block are characterized by the property that they contain a\nunique type of the list. The types define functors from the R-representations of G\nto the right modules over generalized affine Hecke algebras over R with different\nparameters; in positive characteristic l, the parameters are 0 when l = p, and roots\nof unity when l=p.\n/\nIn characteristic 0 or l=p,\n/ for a p-adic linear group, there is a Deligne-Langlands\ncorrespondence for irreducible representations; the irreducible in the unipotent block\nare annihilated by a canonical ideal J; the category of representations annihilated\n* Institut\n\nde Math\u00e9matiques de Jussieu,\n\nvigneras@math.jussieu.fr\n\nUniversit\u00e9 de Paris 7,\n\nFrance.\n\nE-mail:\n\n\f668\n\nM.-F. Vign\u00e9ras\n\nby J is Morita equivalent to the affine Schur algebra, and the unipotent block is\nannihilated by a finite power J k .\nNew phenomena appear when l = p, as the supersingular representations discovered by Barthel-Livne and classified by Ch. Breuil for GL(2, Qp ). The modules\nfor the affine Hecke algebras of parameter 0 and over R of characteristic p, are\nmore tractable than the R-representations of the group, using that the center Z of\na Z[q]-affine Hecke algebra H of parameter q is a finitely algebra and H is a generated Z-module. The classification of the simple modules of the pro-p-Iwahori Hecke\nalgebra of GL(2, F ) suggests the possibility of a Deligne-Langlands correspondence\nin characteristic p.\nComplex case\nNotation. C is the field of complex numbers, G = G(F ) is the group of rational\npoints of a reductive connected group G over a local non archimedean field F with\nresidual field of characteristic p and of finite order q, and ModC G is the category\nof complex smooth representations of G. All representations of G will be smooth,\nthe stabilizer of any vector is open in G. An abelian category C is right (left)\nMorita equivalent to a ring A when C is equivalent to the category of right (left)\nA-modules.\nThe modules over complex affine Hecke algebras with parameter q are related\nby the Borel theorem to the complex representations of reductive p-adic groups.\nBorel Theorem The unipotent block of ModC G is (left and right) Morita\nequivalent to the complex Hecke algebra of the affine Weyl group of G with parameter q.\nThe proof has three main steps, in reverse chronological order, Bernstein a)\n[B] [BK], Borel b) [Bo], [C], Iwahori-Matusmoto c) [IM], [M].\na) (1.a.1) ModC G is a product of indecomposable abelian subcategories \"the\nblocks\".\nThe unipotent block contains the trivial representation. The representations\nin the unipotent block will be called unipotent, although this term is already used\nby Lusztig in a different sense.\n(1.a.2) The irreducible unipotent representations are the irreducible subquotients of the representations parabolically induced from the unramified characters\nof a minimal parabolic subgroup of G.\nb) Let I be an Iwahori subgroup of G (unique modulo conjugation).\n(1.b.1) The category of complex representations of G generated by their Iinvariant vectors is abelian, equivalent by the functor\n\nV 7\u2192 V I = HomCG (C[I\\G], V )\n\n\fModular Representations\n\n669\n\nto the category Mod HC (G, I) of right modules of the Iwahori Hecke algebra\nHC (G, I) = EndCG C[I\\G].\n\n(1.b.2) This abelian category is the unipotent block.\nc) (1.c) The Iwahori Hecke algebra HC (G, I) is the complex Hecke algebra of\nthe affine Weyl group of G with parameter q.\nThe algebra has a very useful description called the Bernstein decomposition\n[L1] [BK], basic for the geometric description of Kazhdan-Lusztig [KL].\nFrom (1.b.1), the irreducible unipotent complex representations of G are in\nnatural bijection with the simple modules of the complex Hecke algebra HC (G, I).\nBy the \"unipotent\" Deligne-Langlands correspondence, the simple HC (G, I)-modules\n\"correspond\" to the G\u2032 -conjugacy classes of pairs (s, N ), where s \u2208 G\u2032 is semisimple, N \u2208 Lie G\u2032 and Ad(s)N = qN , where G\u2032 is the complex dual group of G with\nLie algebra Lie G\u2032 . This is known to be a bijection when G = GL(n, F ) [Z] [R].\nWhen G is adjoint and unramified (quasi-split and split over a finite unramified\nextension), it is also known to be a bijection if one adds a third ingredient, a certain\nirreducible geometric representation \u03c1 of the component group of the simultaneous\ncentralizer of both s and N in G\u2032 ; this is was done by Chriss [C], starting from the\nbasic case where G is split of connected center treated by Kazhdan Lusztig [KL]\nand by Ginsburg [CG] *. The adjoint and unramified case is sufficient for many\napplications to automorphic forms; to my knowledge the general case has not been\ndone.\nAccording to R. Howe, the complex blocks should be parametrized by types.\nThe basic type, the trivial representation of an Iwahori subgroup, is the type of\nthe unipotent block. An arbitrary block should be right Morita equivalent to the\nHecke algebra of the corresponding type. The Hecke algebra of the type should\nbe a generalized affine Hecke complex algebra with different parameters equal to\npositive powers of p. This long program started in 1976 is expected to be completed\nsoon. The most important results are those of Bushnell-Kutzko for GL(n, F ) [BK],\nof Morris for the description of the Hecke algebra of a type [M], of Moy and Prasad\nfor the definition of unrefined types [MP].\nConjecturally, the classification of simple modules over complex generalized\naffine Hecke algebras and the theory of types will give the classification of the\ncomplex irreducible representations of the reductive p-adic groups.\n*\n\nIntroduction page 18. Complex representations of the absolute Weil-Deligne group with\n\nsemi-simple part trivial on the\n\ninertia subgroup\n\n(6.1) are in natural bijection with the l-adic\n\nrepresentations of the absolute Weil group trivial on the\nprime number\n\nl=p\n/\n\nwild ramification subgroup\n\nfor any\n\n[T] [D]. In the Deligne-Langlands correspondence, one considers only the\n\nrepresentations which are Frobenius semi-simple.\n\n\f670\n\nM.-F. Vign\u00e9ras\n\nWe consider now the basic example, the general linear p-adic group GL(n, F ).\nThe the complex irreducible representations of GL(n, F ) over R are related by the\n\"semi-simple\" Deligne-Langlands correspondence (proved by Harris-Taylor [HT1]\nand Henniart [He]), to the representations of the Galois group Gal(F /F ) of a separable algebraic closure F of F .\nDeligne-Langlands correspondence\n(1.d) The blocks of ModC GL(n, F ) are parametrized by the conjugacy classes\nof the semi-simple n-dimensional complex representations \u03c4 of the inertia group\nI(F /F ) which extend to the Galois group Gal(F /F ).\n(1.e) The block parametrized by \u03c4 is equivalent to the unipotent block of\na product of linear groups G\u03c4 = GL(d1 , F1 ) \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 GL(dr , Fr ) over unramified\nP\nextensions Fi of F where\ndi [Fi : F ] = n.\n(1.f ) The irreducible unipotent representations of GL(n, F ) are parametrized\nby the GL(n, R)-conjugacy classes of pairs (s, N ) where s \u2208 GL(n, C) is semisimple, N \u2208 M (n, C) is nilpotent, and sN = qN s.\nModular case Let R be an algebraically closed field of any characteristic.\nWhen the characteristic of R is 0, the theory of representations of G is essentially\nlike the complex theory, and the above results remain true although some proofs\nneed to be modified and this is not always in the litterature. From now on, we\nwill consider \"modular or mod l\" representations, i.e. representations over R of\ncharacteristic l > 0.\nBanal primes Although a reductive p-adic group G is infinite, it behaves\noften as a finite group. Given a property of complex representations of G which\nhas formally a meaning for mod l representations of G, one can usually prove that\noutside a finite set of primes l, the property remains valid. This set of primes is\ncalled \"banal\" for the given property.\nFor mod l representations the Borel theorem is false, because the mod l unipotent block of GL(2, F ) contains representations without Iwahori invariant vectors\nwhen q \u2261 \u22121 mod l [V1].\n(2) The Borel theorem is valid for mod l representations when l does not\ndivide the pro-order of any open compact subgroup of G.\nThese primes are banal for the three main steps in the proof of the complex\ntheorem.\na) (2.a) Any prime is banal for the decomposition of ModR G in blocks.\nThe complex proof of (1.a.1) does not extend. There is a new proof relying of\nthe theory of unrefined types [V5 III.6] when l=p.\n/\nb) (1.a.2), (1.b.1), (1.b.2) remain true because l does not does not divide the\npro-order of the Iwahori subgroup I and [V2] [V4]:\n\n\fModular Representations\n\n671\n\n(2.b) Any irreducible cuspidal mod l-representation of G is injective and projective in the category of mod l-representations of G with a given central character\nwhen l is as in theorem 2.\nc) Any prime l is banal for the Iwahori-Matsumoto step because the proofs of\nIwahori-Matusmoto and of Morris are valid over Z, and for any commutative ring\nA, the Iwahori Hecke A-algebra\nHA (G, I) = EndAG A[I\\G] \u2243 HZ (G, I) \u2297Z A\nis isomorphic to the Hecke A-algebra of the affine Weyl group of G with parameter\nqA where qA is the natural image of q in A.\nThe primes l of theorem 2 are often called the banal primes of G because\nsuch primes are banal for many properties. For example, the category of mod lrepresentations of G with a given central character has finite cohomological dimension [V4]. In the basic example GL(n, F ), l is banal when l=p\n/ and the multiplicative\norder of q modulo l is > n.\nLimit primes The set of primes banal for (1.a.2), (1.b.1) is usually larger\nthan the set of banal primes of G. The primes of this set which are not banal will\nbe called, following Harris, the limit primes of G. In the basic example GL(n, F ),\nthe limit primes l satisfy q \u2261 1 mod l and l > n [V3]. For number theoretic reasons,\nthe limit primes are quite important [DT] [Be] [HT2]. They satisfy almost all the\nproperties of the banal primes. For linear groups, the limit primes are banal for the\nproperty that no cuspidal representation is a subquotient of a proper parabolically\ninduced representation. This is may be true for G general.\nLet Ql be an algebraic closure of the field Ql of l-adic numbers, Zl its ring of\nintegers and Fl its residue field. The following statements follow from the theory of\ntypes, or from the description of the center of the category of mod l representations\n(the Bernstein center).\n(3.1) The reduction gives a surjective map from the isomorphism classes of\nthe irreducible cuspidal integral Ql -representations of G to the irreducible cuspidal\nFl -representations of G, when l is a banal or a limit prime for G.\nNatural characteristic The interesting case where the characteristic of R\nis p is not yet understood. There is a simplification: R-representations of G have\nnon zero vectors invariant by the pro-p-radical Ip of I. The irreducible are quotients\nof R[Ip \\G].\nSome calculations have been made for GL(2, F ) [BL] [Br] [V9]. A direct classification of the irreducible R-representations of G = GL(2, Qp ) [BL] [Br] and of\nthe pro-p-Iwahori Hecke R-algebra HR (G, Ip ) = EndRG R[Ip \\G] (called a mod p\npro-p-Iwahori Hecke algebra) shows:\n(4.1) Suppose R of characteristic p. The pro-p-Iwahori functor gives a bijec-\n\n\f672\n\nM.-F. Vign\u00e9ras\n\ntion between the irreducible R-representations of GL(2, Qp ) and the simple right\nHR (G, Ip )- modules.\nThis is the \"mod p simple Borel theorem\" for the pro-p-Iwahori group of\nGL(2, Qp ). In particular p is banal for the simple version of (1.b.1) when G =\nGL(2, Qp ). Irreducible mod p representations of GL(2, F ) which are non subquotients of parabolically induced representations from a character of the diagonal torus\nare called supersingular [BL]. There is a similar definition for the mod p simple supersingular modules of the pro-p-Iwahori Hecke algebra of GL(2, F ).\n(4.2) There is a natural bijection between the mod p simple supersingular modules of the mod p pro-p-Iwahori Hecke algebra of GL(2, F ) and the mod p\nirreducible dimension 2 representations of the absolute Weil group of F .\nThis suggests the existence of a mod p Deligne-Langlands correspondence.\nSome computations are beeing made by R. Ollivier for GL(3, F ).\nWe end this section with a new result on affine Hecke algebras as in [L3], which\nis important for the theory of representations modulo p.\n(4.3) Let H be an affine Hecke Z[q]-algebra of parameter q associated to a\ngeneralized affine Weyl group W . Then the center Z of H is a finitely generated\nZ[q]-algebra and H is a finitely generated Z-module.\nThe key is to prove that H has a Z[q]-basis (q k(w) Ew )w\u2208W where (Ew ) is a\nBernstein Z[q \u22121 ]-basis of H[q \u22121 ]. The assertion (4.3) was known when the parameter q is invertible.\nNon natural characteristic R an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic l=p.\n/ Any prime l=p\n/ is banal for the \"simple Borel theorem\". The \"simple\nBorel theorem\" is true mod l=p.\n/\n(5.1) Suppose l=p.\n/ The Iwahori-invariant functor gives a bijection between\nthe irreducible R-representations of G with V I =0\n/ and the simple right HR (G, I)modules.\nThe existence of an Haar measure on G with values in R implies that ModR G is\nleft Morita equivalent to the convolution algebra HR (G) of locally constant, compact\ndistributions on G with values in R. When the pro-order of I is invertible in R, the\nHaar measure on G over R normalized by I is an idempotent of HR (G), and (5.1)\ncould have been already proved by I. Schur [V3]. In general (5.1) follows from the\nfact that R[I\\G] is \"almost projective\" [V5].\nMore generally, one expects that the Howe philosophy of types remains true\nfor modular irreducible representations. Their classification should reduce to the\nclassification of the simple modules for generalized affine Hecke R-algebras of parameters equal to 0 if l = p, and to roots of unity if l=p.\n/ This is known for linear\ngroups if l=p\n/ [V5] or in characteristic l = p for GL(2, F ) [V9].\n\n\fModular Representations\n\n673\n\nThe unipotent block is described by a finite set S of modular types, the \"unipotent types\" [V7]. The set S contains the class of the basic type (I, id). In the banal\nor limit case, this is the only element of S. A unipotent type (P, \u03c4 ) is the Gconjugacy class of an irreducible R-representation of a parahoric subgroup P of G,\ntrivial on the pro-p-radical Pp , cuspidal as a representation of P/Pp (the group of\nrational points of a finite reductive group over the residual field of F ). The isomorphism class of the compactly induced representation indG\nP \u03c4 of G determines the\nG-conjugacy class of \u03c4 , and conversely. We have indG\nid\n=\nR[I\\G].\nI\n(5.2) Theorem\n\nSuppose l=p.\n/\nThere exists a finite set S of types, such\n\nthat\n- indG\nP \u03c4 is unipotent for any (P, \u03c4 ) \u2208 S,\n- an irreducible unipotent R-representation V of G is a quotient of indG\nP \u03c4 for\na unique (P, \u03c4 ) \u2208 S, called the type of V ,\nG\n- the map V 7\u2192 HomRG (indG\nP \u03c4, V ) between the irreducible quotients of indP \u03c4\nG\nand the right HR (G, \u03c4 ) = EndRG indP \u03c4 modules is a bijection.\nThe set S has been explicitely described only when G is a linear group [V5].\nIn the example of GL(2, F ) and q \u2261 \u22121 modulo l, the set S has two elements, the\nbasic class and the class of (GL(2, OF ), \u03c4 ) where \u03c4 is the cuspidal representation of\ndimension q \u2212 1 contained in the reduction modulo l of the Steinberg representation\nof the finite group GL(2, Fq ).\nThe Hecke algebra HR (G, \u03c4 ) of the type (P, \u03c4 ) could probably be described\na generalized affine Hecke R-algebra with different parameters (complex case [M]\n[L2], modular case for a finite group [GHM]).\nThe linear group in the non natural characteristic We consider the\nbasic example G = GL(n, F ) and R an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic l=p.\n/\n(6.1)\n\nAny prime l=p\n/ is banal for the Deligne-Langlands correspondence.\n\nThis means that (1.d) (1.e) (1.f) remain true when C is replaced by R. The\nproof is done by constructing congruences between automorphic representations for\nunitary groups of compact type [V6].\nThe unipotent block is partially described by the affine Schur algebra\nSR (G, I) = EndRG V,\n\nV = \u2295P \u2283I indG\nP id,\n\nwhich is the ring of endomorphisms of the direct sum of the representations of\nG compactly induced from the trivial representation of the parahoric subgroups P\ncontaining the Iwahori subgroup I. The functor of I-invariants gives an isomorphism\nfrom the endomorphism ring of the RG-module V to the endomorphism ring of the\nright HR (G, I)-module V I and the (SR (G, I), HR (G, I)) module V I satisfies the\ndouble centralizer property [V8].\n(6.2)\n\nEndHR (G,I) V I = SR (G, I), EndSR (G,I) V I = HR (G, I).\n\n\f674\n\nM.-F. Vign\u00e9ras\n\nIn the complex case, the affine Schur algebra SC (G, I) is isomorphic to an\nalgebra already defined R.M. Green [Gr]: A complex affine quantum linear group\n\u00db (gl(n, q)) has a remarkable representation W of countable dimension such that\nthe tensor space W \u2297n satisfies the double centralizer property\nEnd\u015c(n,q) W \u2297n = \u0124(n, q),\n\nEnd\u0124(n,q) W \u2297n = \u015c(n, q)\n\nwhere \u015c(n, q) is the image of the action of \u00db (gl(n, q)) in W \u2297n . The algebras \u015c(n, q)\nand \u0124(n, q) are respectively isomorphic to SC (G, I) and HC (G, I); the bimodules\nW \u2297n and V I are isomorphic.\nLet J be the annihilator of R[I\\G] in the global Hecke algebra HR (G).\n(6.3) Theorem Suppose l=p.\n/\nThere exists an integer k > 0 such that the unipotent block of ModR G is the\nset of R-representations of G annihilated by J k .\nAn irreducible representation of G is unipotent if and only if it is a subquotient\nof R[I\\G], if and only if it is annihilated by J.\nThe abelian subcategory of representations of G annihilated by J is Morita\nequivalent to the affine Schur algebra SR (G, I).\nThis generalizes the Borel theorem to mod l representations when G is a linear\ngroup. The affine Schur algebra exists and the double centralizer property (6.2) is\ntrue for a general reductive p-adic group G; in the banal case, the affine Schur\nalgebra is Morita equivalent to the affine Hecke algebra.\nIntegral structures Let l be any prime number. There are two notions\nof integrality for an admissible Ql -representation V of G, dim V K < \u221e for all\nopen compact subgroups K of G, which coincide when l=p\n/ [V3]. One says that\nV is integral if V contains a G-stable Zl -submodule generated by a Ql -basis of V ,\nand V is locally integral if the HQ (G, K)-module V K is integral, i.e. contains a\nl\n\nHZl (G, K)-submodule Zl -generated by a Ql -basis of V K , for all K.\nWhen V is irreducible and integral, the action of the center Z of G on V , the\ncentral character, is integral, i.e. takes values in Zl . The situation is similar for\na simple integral HQ (G, I)-module W . The central character is integral, i.e. its\nl\n\nrestriction to the center of HZl (G, I) takes values in Zl .\n(7.1) Th\u00e9or\u00e8me\na) An irreducible cuspidal Ql -representation V of G is integral if and only if\nits central character is integral.\nb) A simple HQ (G, I)-module is integral if and only if its central character is\nl\nintegral.\nc) An irreducible representation V of G with V I =0\n/ is locally integral if and\nonly if V I is an integral HQ (G, I)-module.\nl\n\nThe assertion b) results from (4.3). For a) [V3]. For l = p, c) is due to J.-F.\n\n\fModular Representations\n\n675\n\nDat, using its theory of l-adic analysis [D].\nA general irreducible Ql -representation V of G is contained in a parabolically\ninduced representation of an irreducible cuspidal representation W of a Levi subgroup of G. If W is integral then V is integral, but the converse is false when\nl = p. When l=p,\n/ the converse is proved for classical groups by Dat using results\nof Moeglin (there is a gap in the \"proof\" of the converse in [V3]).\n(7.2) Brauer-Nesbitt principle [V3][V11] When l=p,\n/ the integral structures L of an irreducible Ql -representation of G are Zl G-finitely generated (hence\ncommensurable) and their reduction L \u2297 Fl are finite length Fl -representations of\nG with the same semi-simplication (modulo isomorphism).\nWhen l = p, this is false. An integral cuspidal irreducible Qp -representation\nV of G embeds in Qp [\u0393\\G], for any discrete co-compact-mod-center subgroup \u0393 of\nG, and has a natural integral structure with an admissible reduction [V10]. When\nthe theory of types is known, V is induced from an open compact-mod-center subgroup, hence has an integral structure with a non admissible reduction, which is\nnot commensurable with the first one.\n\nReferences\n[BL] Barthel L., Livne R., Modular representations of GL2 of a local field: the\nordinary unramified case, J. of Number Theory 55, 1995, 1\u201327.
