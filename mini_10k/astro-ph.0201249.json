This column density is an order of\nmagnitude lower than the critical H i column density, \u223c2\u00d71019 cm\u22122 , where the ionized fraction is thought to\nincrease dramatically due to the extragalactic radiation field.

Introduction\nHigh\u2013velocity clouds (HVCs) were first encountered in the\n\u03bb 21 cm line of H i at radial velocities unexplained by\nany conventional model of Galactic rotation. Since their\ndiscovery by Muller et al. (1963), they have remained\nenigmatic objects of continued interest. Wakker & Van\nWoerden (1997) and Wakker et al. (1999) have given\nrecent reviews; since these reviews, progress has been\nmade on several fronts. The anomalous\u2013velocity clouds\nare found scattered over the entire sky, and examples\nare found throughout a range of radial velocity spanning\nabout 800 km s\u22121 : obtaining an adequate observational\nfoundation for the phenomenon has been a persistent and\ncontinuing challenge. We describe here a search algorithm\nwhich has been applied to the all\u2013sky coverage afforded\nSend offprint requests to: V. de Heij\n\u22c6\nTable 1 is only available in electronic form at the CDS\nvia anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.125.5) or via\nhttp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/Abstract.html\n\nby the new H i surveys of the northern and southern skys,\nand the results of its application to the Leiden/Dwingeloo\nSurvey for examples of the phenomenon.\nDuring the past forty years, a wide variety of explanations for the HVCs has been suggested. The matter of\ndistances has remained particularly difficult, and it is on\ndistances that most of the basic physical properties depend. Only in a few cases have distances been measured\nor constrained. The distinct system of anomalous\u2013velocity\nfeatures recognised as the Magellanic Stream represents\ntidal debris originating in a gravitational interaction of\nthe Large and Small Magellanic Clouds with our Galaxy\n(see Putman & Gibson 1999), and is therefore likely to\nbe located at distances of several tens of kpc. Other distinct systems of high\u2013velocity objects constitute a few\ncomplexes, stretching over regions of some tens of square\ndegrees. One of these, Complex A, has been found from\nabsorption\u2013line observations (van Woerden et al. 1999;\nWakker 2001) to lie within the distance range 8 < d < 10\nkpc. But the term HVC has been used to encompass a\n\n\f2\n\nV. de Heij et al.: An automated search for HVCs in the LDS\n\nwide range of phenomena; unlike the Magellanic Stream\nand the half\u2013dozen well\u2013known complexes, many of the individual anomalous\u2013velocity features are compact and are\nisolated on the sky down to low column density limits, as\nwe will demonstrate below. The properties of anomalous\u2013\nvelocity H i emission might be more readily determined\nafter a classification into sub\u2013categories has been made.\nAfter compiling a general catalog of high\u2013velocity features\nin the northern sky, we focus on identifying the category\nof compact, isolated features, which show no connection\nin position and velocity with the Galaxy, the Magellanic\nClouds or the extended HVC complexes. Braun & Burton\n(1999) have argued that these objects may represent a\nsingle class of clouds, whose members originated under\nsimilar circumstances and which share a common evolutionary history, and which might lie scattered throughout\nthe Local Group.\nThe idea that the anomalous\u2013velocity clouds are deployed throughout the Local Group has been considered\nearlier, by (among others) Oort (1966, 1970, and 1981),\nVerschuur (1975), Eichler (1976), Einasto et al. (1976),\nGiovanelli (1981), Arp (1985), and Bajaja et al. (1987).\nVarious arguments have been raised against these interpretations. In the first review of the possible interpretations of high\u2013velocity clouds, Oort (1966) ruled out the\nsupposition that the clouds could be independent systems\nin the Local Group on two principal grounds: he stated\nthat \" ... a situation outside our Galaxy would give no\nexplanation of the principal characteristic of the high\u2013\nlatitude clouds, viz. that the high velocities ... are all negative\", and furthermore that \" ... it would be almost impossible to explain on this hypothesis high\u2013velocity clouds\nwhich apear to be related with each other over regions\n30\u25e6 or more in diameter\". Since Oort's first review, newer\nH i surveys have extended the sky coverage and have revealed that there are, in fact, approximately as many\n(compact) anomalous\u2013velocity clouds at positive velocities as there are at negative velocities; and the objection\nagainst the large angular size of the complexes is confronted by the knowledge that these features, in any case,\nare indeed located within the Galactic halo.\nBy analyzing the stability of a median HVC (in the\nWakker & Van Woerden 1991 tabulation) against Galactic\ntidal disruption and self\u2013gravity, Blitz et al. (1999) suggest a distance of 1 Mpc, for an assumed ratio between\nH i mass and total mass of 0.1. Furthermore they suggest\nthat the preferred coordinate system for the clouds is neither the Local Standard of Rest system, nor the Galactic\nStandard of Rest system, but the Local Group Standard\nof Rest system. The amplitude of the average velocity and\nthe velocity dispersion of the cloud system both have the\nlowest values in this system, indicating that it might be\nthe most relevant. A numerical simulation of the dynamics\nof a population of low mass test masses within the gravitational potential of the Milky Way and M 31, reproduces\nsome aspects of the kinematic and spatial distribution of\nthe clouds. They suggest that the HVCs are the unused\n\nbuilding blocks of the Local Group, falling towards its\nbarycenter.\nBraun & Burton (1999, hereafter BB99) reached similar conclusions based on a study of a distinct subset of the\nHVC population. By restricting their attention to compact, isolated CHVCs, they exclude the contribution of\nthe nearby, less representative clouds. The hypothesis is\nthat the compact clouds might be the distant counterparts of the nearby, large angular size complexes. The\ncompact sample also shows a natural preference for the\nLocal Group Standard of Rest system, wherein its velocity dispersion (88 km s\u22121 ) is lower than in either the\nLSR or GSR frames. The CHVCs even allow definition\nof a new coordinate system in which a global minimum\nof the velocity dispersion (69 km s\u22121 ) is obtained. This\nsystem agrees with the Local Group system at about the\none sigma level. Furthermore, analysis of high resolution\nimages of sixteen of the CHVCs provide several independent indications of distances of between 150 and 850 kpc\n(Braun & Burton 2000; Burton et al. 2001, 2001).\nThe BB99 sample was obtained by visual inspection of\nthe Leiden/Dwingeloo Survey (LDS) of the local H i sky\ncarried out by Hartmann & Burton (1997). The LDS surveyed the sky as far south as the Dwingeloo horizon, that\nis to a declination of \u221230\u25e6 ; lacking information on the\nmore southern declinations, the BB99 conclusions were\nbased on an incomplete sample. A major improvement\nof the CHVC study would be an extension to the whole\nsky. Its high sensitivity and fully\u2013Nyquist sampling makes\nthe recently completed Parkes All\u2013Sky Survey, HIPASS,\n(Barnes et al. 2001) ideal for extending the CHVC sample.\nTo create an all\u2013sky resource which is as homogeneous as\npossible, an automated algorithm has been developed and\nis described here. This paper also discusses application of\nthe algorithm to the LDS; a separate paper (Putman et al.\n2002) gives the results from applying the algorithm to the\nHIPASS southern\u2013hemisphere data.\nOur discussion is organized as follows. We begin by\ndescribing the data used and the importance of obtaining\nconfirming observations in \u00a72, proceed with a description\nof the algorithm and selection criteria in \u00a73, present a catalog of both compact and extended high\u2013velocity clouds\nin \u00a74, and conclude with a brief discussion of the global\nproperties of the cataloged objects in \u00a75.\n\n2. Observations\nThe LDS was observed with the 25\u2013m Dwingeloo telescope, whose FWHM beam subtends 36 arcminutes, on\na grid of 0.\u25e6 5 by 0.\u25e6 5 true\u2013angle separation. It covered\nthe sky north of declination \u221230\u25e6 completely on this\ngrid, and extended in a less complete fashion a few degrees further south. The effective velocity coverage of the\nLDS spans Local Standard of Rest velocities from \u2212450\nkm s\u22121 to +400 km s\u22121 , resolved into spectral channels of\n1.03 km s\u22121 width. The nominal brightness\u2013temperature\nsensitivity of the LDS is 0.07 K, although this value varies\nfor individual spectra. Hartmann et al. (1996) describe the\n\n\fV. de Heij et al.: An automated search for HVCs in the LDS\n\ncorrections applied to the LDS material in order to remove\ncontamination by stray radiation.\nThere can be various causes of imperfections in a survey such as the Leiden/Dwingeloo one; of these, radio\nfrequency interference (RFI) is the most pernicious, as\nit can be responsible for false detections of just the sort\nof spectral signals being sought in this analysis, namely\nfeatures of quite weak intensity, moderate\u2013to\u2013substantial\nfrequency width, and occuring in only one spectrum or in\na few adjacent spectra. More commonly, RFI produces extremely narrow spike signals, or a characteristic sin(x)/x\nringing, and can be rather easily recognised by these and\nother properties as not being of an interstellar origin. But\nHartmann (1994) and Hartmann & Burton (1997) show\nexamples of RFI signals detected in the LDS which mimic\nthe properties of spectral features of astronomical interest.\nIn these examples, the interference was of short temporal\nduration, thereby disabling the common diagnostic tool of\nbeing on the look\u2013out for features remaining at a constant\nfrequency, or with an unusual telltale drift in frequency.\nBecause the isolated objects being sought here appear at only several of the LDS lattice points, or even\nat only one, confirmation was sought by independent observations. This policy of demanding independent confirmation in all cases had lead BB99 to reject many candidate CHVCs from their listing. BB99 had been able to\ncarry out the independent confirmations using either the\nNRAO 140\u2013foot telescope or the Dwingeloo 25\u2013meter; but\nsince neither of these instruments is currently operative,\nwe sought confirmations in new observations, made with\nthe Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT). The\nimportance of the confirmation observations is stressed by\nthe fact that only 116 of the 171 candidate isolated features which we found in the LDS could be verified. Some\ncandidates, like the one shown in Fig. 1, were revealed to\nbe due to RFI contamination and thus spurious, despite\nthe fact that their spectral properties show similarities\nwith those of a genuine astronomical feature. Other candidates masquerading as astronomical features were attributed to the vagaries of noise. (Knowing that confirmation would be demanded, the original list of 171 candidates\nwas prepared with rather liberal noise constraints.)\nConfirming observations were deemed unnecessary for\nthose candidate features which could be identified with objects listed in previously published investigations based on\nindependent data. Most important in this regard are the\nhigh\u2013velocity cloud catalogs of Wakker & van Woerden\n(1991), extracted from the surveys of Hulsbosch & Wakker\n(1988) and Bajaja et al. (1985); the BB99 catalog of\nCHVCs extracted from the Leiden/Dwingeloo survey and\nreconfirmed with additional observations; and the catalog\nof Putman et al. (2002) extracted from the HIPASS data\nusing the algorithm described here.\nThe differences in angular and velocity resolutions,\nsampling intervals, and sensitivities of the surveys required different criteria to ascertain matches with the features identified as candidates by the search algorithm.\nIdentification of the candidates with the BB99 objects\n\n3\n\nFig. 1. Two examples illustrating the role played by\nindependent confirming observations made using the\nWesterbork Synthesis Radio Telescope in total\u2013power\nmode. The triplet of panels on the top shows the LDS\nsky image of a candidate CHVC; the lower of the spectra\nshows the signal as it appears in the LDS. The upper spectrum shows the deeper observation of the same position as\ncarried out with the WSRT: the LDS candidate was not\nconfirmed, but was evidently a consequence of radio frequency interference. The triplet of panels on the bottom\nshows that the candidate feature, CHVC 099+07\u2212356,\ncould be confirmed using the WSRT, which provided the\nupper righthand spectrum. The WSRT spectra used for\nthe confirmation of all LDS candidates for which there\nwere no other independent data were substantially more\nsensitive than the LDS material. The crosses on the lower\nleft of the sky images show the angular extent of a true\ndegree on the sky. Contours are drawn in these images\nat 50% and 25% of the peak value of the signal perceived\nfrom the candidate cloud; the gray color\u2013bar indicates\nscaling in units of K km s\u22121 .\nis straightforward, because the LDS material serves as\ninput in both cases; no additional confirmation was required, because BB99 had already adequately confirmed\nthe signals. Establishing correspondence with objects in\nthe Putman et al. catalog is also straightforward. The\nHIPASS material was Nyquist sampled at the angular resolution of 15.\u2032 5 afforded by the Parkes 64\u2013m telescope,\nand at a 5\u03c3 rms brightnes\u2013temperature sensitivity of approximately 50 mK over 26 km s\u22121 . In these observational\nparameters the HIPASS data surpasses the LDS data,\nand they suffice as independent confirmation of candidates identified in the LDS. We note, however, that the\n26 km s\u22121 velocity resolution of the HIPASS data is substantially coarser than the 1.03 km s\u22121 resolution of the\nLDS; thus it is possible that an object of narrow linewidth\nwould be detected in the LDS but would be diluted by as\nmuch as a factor of 25 in the coarser HIPASS velocity coverage. There are, in fact, two objects listed in the CHVC\ncatalog given in Table 2 which lie at declinations in the\noverlap zone, \u221230\u25e6 < \u03b4 < +2\u25e6 , but which are not listed\nin the Putman et al. catalog.\nEstablishing correspondence with objects listed in the\nWakker & van Woerden (1991) catalog is less straightforward, because that listing is based on H i observations\nmade at substantially coarser angular and spectral sampling than pertain to the LDS (although at comparable\nsensitivity, if measured after the surveys are convolved to\nsimilar spectral and angular resolutions). The Hulsbosch\n& Wakker (1988) data, on which most of the Wakker &\nvan Woerden catalog depends, pertains to observations\nmade using the Dwingeloo 25\u2013meter telescope at declinations above \u221218\u25e6 , at a velocity resolution of 8.2 km s\u22121 ,\nand on a 1\u25e6 by 1\u25e6 grid; the southern material of Bajaja\net al. (1985) was observed on the IAR 100\u2013foot telescope\nat somewhat lower rms sensitivity then the Hulsbosch &\n\n\f4\n\nV. de Heij et al.: An automated search for HVCs in the LDS\n\nWakker survey and at comparable velocity resolution, but\non a coarser sampling grid of 2\u25e6 by 2\u25e6 .\nCandidates identified by our search algorithm in the\nLDS were judged to correspond with objects in the catalog\nof Wakker & van Woerden if the spatial separation of the\ncandidate and the Wakker & van Woerden listing does not\nexceed 1\u25e6 and if, in addition, the velocity separation does\nnot exceed 25 km s\u22121 ; furthermore, the velocity difference\nwas required to be less than the velocity dispersion of the\nGaussian which fits the central spectrum: the clouds in\nthe Wakker & van Woerden catalog were constructed from\nthe Gaussian profile decomposition components listed by\nHulsbosch & Wakker. A correspondence between the profile components and the LDS candidate which met these\ncriteria was judged as independent confirmation. Of all of\nthe objects cataloged in Table 2, i.e. including the CHVC,\n:HVC, and ?HVC categories defined below, 33 of the 116\ncould not be identified with a Wakker & van Woerden\ncloud; 28 of the 67 objects classified as CHVCs do not have\na Wakker & van Woerden counterpart. In all of the cases\nwhere there is an identifiable counterpart, the coarser resolution of the Wakker & van Woerden material precludes\nmeasuring the degree of compactness or isolation: these\nmeasures in Table 2 are based on the LDS data.\nFor the confirming observations which we required\nfor all of the candidates with no definite counterpart in\nearlier data, we used the Westerbork Synthesis Radio\nTelescope in the newly\u2013available total\u2013power observing\nmode whereby high\u2013resolution auto\u2013correlation spectra\nare obtained from all 14 individual 25\u2013meter antennas,\nrather than the more usual cross-correlation spectra. The\nposition\u2013switching mode involved observing on\u2013spectra\nwith the antennas pointed toward the candidate and off\u2013\nspectra pointing at the same declination but with right ascension offsets of \u00b13\u25e6 . The data from all 14 different telescopes and both linear polarisations were averaged into\na single spectrum, after obvious interference signals and\nother forms of unreliable data had been removed. Finally,\nthe (on \u2013 off) / off spectrum was determined, using the\naverage of both off spectra. With an average rms noise\nof 0.02 K over 1.03 km s\u22121 , the WSRT spectra are substantially more sensitive than the original Leiden/Dwingeloo\nspectra for which confirmation was being sought. Figure 1\ndisplays two WSRT and LDS pairs, one of which provided confirmation and one of which revealed RFI contamination perniciously mimicking a compact high\u2013velocity\ncloud.\n\n3. Algorithm and selection criteria\n3.1. Algorithm\nA quantified, automated routine for extracting HVCs\nshould be designed such that it can be applied in a general way, i.e. to surveys other than the LDS; in that way\nit can also permit analysis of sample completeness. There\nare several different options for extracting structure from\na three\u2013dimensional data cube, each having certain ad-\n\nvantages and disadvantages. By using a predefined cloud\nmodel, for example, one could decompose the data into\na set of clouds which conform to that predefined model.\nThe input cloud model can be described by a parametric\nfunction which is subsequently fit to the data. Because the\nshape of each cloud is presumed known, one is able, in the\ncontext of that presumption, to handle blended emission\nfrom two or more clouds. An example of this approach is\ngiven by Stutzki & G\u00fcsten (1990), who used a Gaussian\nparametric form to unravel C18 O emission from molecular\nclouds. Alternatively, one could create a predefined set of\nvarious possible clouds. Thilker et al. (1998) designed such\nan algorithm, and applied it to look for H i bubbles blown\nby supernovae in external galaxies.\nA different approach, not based on an a priori cloud\nmodel, was used by Williams et al. (1994), among others. Williams et al. defined a set of contours of constant\nintensity, and then scanned their molecular\u2013cloud data\nfor clumpy structure. Starting at a high intensity level,\na closed contour only contains the peak of a clump; by\nslowly decreasing the contour level, the exact shape of the\ncloud emerges. If the emission of a nearby cloud shows up\nin the contour, a friend\u2013of\u2013friend algorithm can be used\nto determine to which cloud each pixel belongs. To extract\nclouds properly, the difference between adjacent contour\nlevels has to be small: otherwise, two nearby clouds which\neach contribute local intensity peaks but with only small\ndifferences in the peak values will be extracted as a single\nstructure.\nFollowing the Williams et al. (1994) approach, we also\nuse a procedure without a presumed cloud model. But in\nour approach, instead of scanning for clouds along contours of constant intensity at varying levels, we use the\ngradient of the intensity field to determine the structure\nto which the pixels should be assigned. By assuming that\nthe pixels belong to the same structure as their brightest neighbours, we are able to extract clouds of arbitrary\nshapes and sizes.\nThe procedure is illustrated by Fig. 2. Starting at any\npixel, we proceed to its brightest neighbour, and then keep\ncontinuously moving to the brightest neighbour of each\npixel we pass, until a local maximum is found. The local\nmaximum defines the peak of the structure of which the\ncomplete track followed is part. Applying this procedure\nto all pixels enables us to split up the complete three\u2013\ndimensional data set into structures, i.e. clouds. The exact\nresult depends on which of the adjacent pixels are called\nneighbours. One could confine the set of neighbours to the\nadjacent pixels with a difference in one, two, or three coordinate values of the three\u2013dimensional set. During our\nsearch for isolated high\u2013velocity clouds, we treated all adjacent pixels as neighbours, which are 26 in number for a\nthree\u2013dimensional data set.\nEach local maximum in the data is, formally, the peak\nof a cloud, even if the local maximum is just a small wiggle in a spectrum produced, for example, by the vagaries\nof Gaussian noise. To reduce the effect of local maxima\nwith a low contrast compared to their environment, ad-\n\n\fV. de Heij et al.: An automated search for HVCs in the LDS\n\nFig. 2. Example in two dimensions illustrating the assignment of pixels to local maxima and the resulting definition of clouds. Starting at the pixels at low intensities\n(but above the 1.5\u03c3 level), the algorithm finds the appropriate maximum by moving from brightest neighbour\nto brightest neighbour. Should a pixel have two equally\nbright neighbours, the assignment is random. The righthand panel shows the result of the pixel assignment.\n\njacent clouds with low contrast were merged: specifically,\ntwo adjacent clouds were merged if the level of the brightest intensity contour which enclosed the peaks of both\nclouds exceeded either 0.2 K or 50% of the intensity of the\nbrightest peak. The brighter of the peaks of the merged\nstructures was considered the peak of the new cloud. If\na cloud was encompassed by more than one neighbour, it\nwas joined with the neighbour with the lowest contrast.\nOnce a new cloud was formed, we checked if neighbouring structures should then be merged, according to the\ncriterion described, with this new cloud.\nNot all pixels were assigned to a cloud. We only assigned pixels with a signal\u2013to\u2013noise ratio of at least 1.5\nto a cloud. Before the clouds were merged, we required\nthat the intensities of their peaks should exceed three\ntimes the noise value. After all clouds were merged, we required furthermore that the peaks have a signal\u2013to\u2013noise\nratio of at least five. As a consequence, a cloud candidate with a signal\u2013to\u2013noise ratio of three which is not\nmerged with other clouds was removed from the list. To\ndetermine the correct intensities for the pixels which are\nformed into clouds and the peak intensities of the clouds\nbefore merging, we used a fixed, preset noise value valid\nfor the complete survey. The signal\u2013to\u2013noise ratio of the\npeaks of the clouds after merging was determined from a\nlocally\u2013measured noise value. This value was determined\nin a square measuring 31 by 31 pixels, centered on the\ncloud and located in the velocity channel map containing\nthe peak intensity of the cloud in question. A lower limit\nwas used for this newly determined noise value, equal to\nthe preset noise value.\nAn interative procedure was used to determine the\nnoise in the region around the cloud peak. We started\nwith a sample consisting of all pixels in the 31\u2013by\u201331 pixel\nsquare. After determining the median, \u03bc, and the absolute\ndeviation, \u03b4, of the pixels considered, all pixels which were\nnot in the range \u03bc \u00b1 f * \u03b4 were removed from the sample.\nBy repeatedly applying the rejection criterion, we created\na sample for which all pixels lay in the range \u03bc \u00b1 f * \u03b4. The\nnoise was then set equal to the standard deviation of this\nsample. The exact result depends heavily on the chosen\nvalue of the factor f . The more real emission there is in\nthe sample, the lower the value of f should be. We have\nused the value f = 3.0, which was found to give reasonable\nresults.\n\n5\n\n3.2. Application of the search algorithm to the LDS\nThe algorithm described above can be applied generally,\ni.e. to a variety of data sets. We describe here its application to the Leiden/Dwingeloo H i survey. The LDS was\nprepared for the algorithm as follows. It was first divided\ninto 24 separate data cubes, each cube spanning an area\nof extent 128\u25e6 by 128\u25e6 , and representing the H i sky in\na zenith equal\u2013area projection. The sky area beyond the\ninner 64\u25e6 by 64\u25e6 overlaps with neighbouring cubes. We\nconstructed separate cubes for the positive and for the\nnegative Local Standard of Rest velocities.\nFor the initial pass of the algorithm, the data cubes\nwere Hanning smoothed, with the twofold motivation of\nreducing the detections of apparent clouds contributed by\nlocal maxima in the noise fluctuations and in order to reduce the amount of computer memory required to a level\nconsistent with our capabilities. The data were smoothed\nwith a Gaussian function with a FWHM of 12 km s\u22121 in\nthe spectral direction and 1.\u25e6 2 along the spatial axes. A\nconstant rms noise value of 0.01 K was used for the preset\nnoise parameter. Once all pixels with a sufficient brightness temperature were assigned to clouds, the Hanning\nsmoothed data (angular sampling 0.\u25e6 5, velocity resolution\n2.06 km s\u22121 ) were used to derive the cloud properties.\nA velocity\u2013integrated intensity map of each cloud was\nalso extracted from the data. The range of integration\nextends over the velocity range of the pixels that were\nassigned to a particular cloud. A description of all derived cloud parameters is listed in \u00a74. After lists of clouds\nand their properties were produced for all of the separate cubes, they were merged into one catalog. During the\nmerging process double entries which were found in the\nregions of overlapping cubes were eliminated.\nInitial application of the search algorithm to the LDS\nresulted in a list of all objects satisfying the search criteria, and thus included not only compact high\u2013velocity\nclouds, but also structures that are part of the high\u2013\nvelocity\u2013cloud complexes, the intermediate\u2013velocity features, and even the gaseous disk of our Galaxy, as well as\nfeatures which were subsequently eliminated as due to excessive noise, radio interference, the non\u2013square response\nof the receiver bandpass, or other imperfections in the\ndata. To remove emission associated with our Galaxy and\nthe intermediate\u2013velocity complexes, all clouds with a deviation velocity VDEV less than 70 km s\u22121 were removed.\nThe deviation velocity, as defined by Wakker (1990), is\nthe excess velocity of a feature compared to the velocities allowed by a simple model of the kinematics of our\nGalaxy. A description of the model used here to define\nthe deviation velocity is given in the following subsection.\nIn order to remove the putative clouds associated with\nimperfections in the data, an additional signal\u2013to\u2013noise\ncriterion was adopted, namely that the line integral of the\ncloud in the spectrum which passes through the cloud peak\nshould exceed the 8\u03c3 value. To determine the noise in the\nspectrum, all channels identified with the feature and with\na deviation velocity less than 100 km s\u22121 were excluded\n\n\f6\n\nV. de Heij et al.: An automated search for HVCs in the LDS\n\nfrom consideration. The iterative procedure described in\nthe previous section\nwas\nR\n\u221a then followed to determine \u03c3.\nFeatures with IdV /( nV * \u03c3 * \u2206V ) < 8, (where nV is the\nnumber of summed velocity channels of width \u2206V ) were\nremoved from the list.\nThe low\u2013frequency edge of the receiver bandpass used\nin the LDS had a strong roll-off beyond about +400\nkm s\u22121 , which resulted in the occasional appearance of\nspectral features at the positive\u2013velocity extremes which\ncould be confused with one wing of a cloud of astronomical interest. The situation at the extreme positive velocities in the LDS is further confused by the relatively frequent occurance of interference in this regime. Although\nthe positive\u2013velocity wings of the LDS spectra published\nby Hartmann & Burton (1997) had already been truncated at a VLSR of +400 km s\u22121 , in recognition of the\nbandpass and RFI problems (even though the nominal response of the receiver extended to +500 km s\u22121 ), it seemed\npractical to adopt an even lower upper\u2013velocity limit for\nthis project. Therefore all objects with VLSR greater than\n+350 km s\u22121 were excluded from the list. This selection is,\nhowever, probably without any consequence for the high\u2013\nvelocity\u2013cloud phenomenon. The most extreme positive\nvelocity of the CHVC ensemble found by BB99 in the\nnorthern hemisphere was +216 km s\u22121 ; the most extreme\npositive velocity found in this analysis is +268, namely\nfor :HVC 357.5 + 05.6 + 268. The southern hemisphere\nCHVC listing is particularly relevant in this regard; a deployment of objects scattered throughout the Local Group\nand with a net infall motion (see BB99) would result in\nmore objects at positive velocities in the southern hemisphere than in the northern. Nevertheless, although relatively more positive\u2013velocity CHVCs were indeed found by\nthe Putman et al. (2002) search through the HIPASS material (using the algorithm described here) over the range\n\u2212700 < VLSR < +500 km s\u22121 , only one of the objects\nidentified as a CHVC had a positive velocity more extreme\nthan +350 km s\u22121 , namely CHVC 258.2 \u2212 23.9 + 359.\nThe LDS sampled the sky on the complete 0.\u25e6 5 \u00d7 0.\u25e6 5\ngrid down to a declination of \u221230\u25e6 , with some observations on an incomplete grid extending several degrees\nfurther south. The degree of isolation of an object can\nonly be determined if the surroundings are well observed.\nBecause the information on the surroundings could not\nbe determined close to the edges of the survey coverage, no new anomalous\u2013velocity object with a declination\nless than \u221228\u25e6 was entered in the catalog as a CHVC.\n(Four entries in Table 2 have \u03b4 < \u221228\u25e6: numbers 107\nand 109 correspond to two objects discussed by BB99 -\ntheir numbers 56 and 58, respectively - and these had\nbeen subject by BB99 to new Dwingeloo observations on\na Nyquist grid, confirming their classification; number 113\nis confirmed by other data as indicated in Table 2; and\nnumber 114 lies in a region where the LDS is complete,\ndespite the low declination.)\nThe degree of isolation of the clouds was determined\nfrom the velocity\u2013integrated images covering, an area\nmeasuring 10\u25e6 by 10\u25e6 centered on the position and ve-\n\nFig. 3. Representative examples of the designation of confirmed anomalous\u2013velocity features into the classes of\nCHVC, :HVC, ?HVC, and HVC. The crosses on the lower\nleft of each image show the angular extent of a true degree\non the sky. The contours correspond to NHI = 1.5, 3, 4.5\nand 6\u00d71018 cm\u22122 ; the gray-scale\u2013bar indicates scaling in\nunits of K km s\u22121 . Anomalous\u2013velocity H i features designated as CHVCs are tightly constrained in their degree of\nisolation at NHI =1.5\u00d71018 cm\u22122 ; :HVCs have some elongation with respect to their environment; ?HVCs have an\nenhanced background NHI ; and HVCs are organized into\nlarge complexes at a significantly higher NHI =5\u201320\u00d71018\ncm\u22122 .\nlocity of the cloud in question. The velocity interval of\neach image was matched to the entire velocity extent of\nthe object in question. An ellipse was fit to the contour\nwith a value of half the maximum brightness of the cloud\nto allow tabulation of size and orientation. The degree of\nisolation is assessed on the basis of the lowest significant\ncontour level of H i column density commensurate with\nthe data sensitivity. Given the median FWHM linewidth\nof about 25 km s\u22121 , this corresponds to a 3\u03c3 level of about\n1.5\u00d71018 cm\u22122 . Although there is a small variation of the\n3\u03c3 NHI level with object linewidth, we chose to keep this\nvalue fixed for the purposes of uniformity. We demanded\nthat this contour satisfy the following criteria: (1) that it\nbe closed, with its greatest radial extent less than the 10\u25e6\nby 10\u25e6 image size; and (2) that it not be elongated in the\ndirection of any nearby extended emission.\nA slightly different criterion for isolation was employed\nby Putman et al. 2002 in their analysis of the HIPASS\nsample of HVCs. Rather than employing a fixed minimum\ncolumn density contour to make this assessment, they employed the contour at 25% of the peak NHI for each object.\nSince the majority of detected objects are relatively faint,\nwith a peak column density near 12\u03c3, the two criteria are\nnearly identical for most objects. Only for the brightest\n\u223c10% of sources might the resulting classifications differ.\nFigure 3 shows an example for each of the groups of the\nclassification. Since a degree of subjectivity is involved in\nthe assessment of elongation with respect to nearby emission, two of the authors (VdH and RB) each independently\ncarried out a complete classification of the 1280 cloud candidates. Identical independent classifications were made in\n89% of all cases. A consensus was reached for the remaining sources after re-examination.\n\n3.3. Deviation velocity\nEvery direction on the sky contains some H i emission\nfrom the Milky Way, which needs to be avoided when\nsearching for high\u2013velocity clouds. The kinematic and\nspatial properties of the Milky Way are well\u2013enough behaved, and well\u2013enough known, that contamination of the\nanomalous\u2013velocity sky by H i emission from the conventional Galactic disk can be largely avoided. Wakker (1990)\n\n\fV. de Heij et al.: An automated search for HVCs in the LDS\n\nintroduced the measure of deviation velocity, defined as\nthe difference between the velocity of the cloud and the\nnearest limit of the velocities allowed by a conventional\nmodel of the differential rotation of the Galaxy in the\nsame direction. Wakker's definition of deviation velocity\nwas based on the kinematic limits predicted for a differentially rotating flat disk of uniform thickness. In order to\nconstrain possible Milky Way contamination more accurately, we modified the definition of deviation velocity to\naccount for the fact that the Milky Way H i disk is warped,\nand also flares, i.e. increases in thickness with increasing\nGalactocentric distance, and that it is not circular when\nviewed from above, but lopsided.\nIn order to determine the VLSR which corresponds to\nthe given VDEV , we modeled the kinematics and spatial\nproperties of the Galactic H i and calculated synthetic\nH i spectra. The range of acceptable Galactic velocities\nwas then set by the velocities for which the brightness\ntemperatures of the synthetic spectra, corresponding to\nthis model, exceed 0.5 K. The model consists of a thin\ndisk which has constant properties (central density, nHI =\n0.35 cm\u22123 , and kinetic temperature, Tk = 100 K) within\n11.5 kpc from the Galactic center and which warps and\nflares beyond that radius. The vertical z\u2013distribution of\nthe gas layer is given by a Gaussian, with a dispersion\nof 180 pc for R \u2264 11.5 kpc and increasing by 80 pc for\neach kpc further outward than 11.5 kpc. This thickness\nis higher than that derived by Baker & Burton (1975),\nfor example, in order account for the fact that the low\u2013\nlevel wings of Galactic H i are generally broader than the\nGaussian form exhibited at higher intensities, and thus\nto include more of the low\u2013level disk gas, especially in\nthe outer Galaxy, into the model. For R \u2264 11.5 kpc the\nGaussian is centered around z = 0 kpc; for R > 11.5 kpc,\nthe center of the gas layer is at the height\n\u00132\n\u0012\nR \u2212 11.5\nR \u2212 11.5\n(1 \u2212 2 cos(\u03c6)) (1)\nsin(\u03c6) + 0.3\nz=\n6\n6\nas determined by Binney & Merrifield (1998) from the\nVoskes & Burton (1999) analysis of combined southern\nand northern Milky Way H i survey data. The variable\n\u03c6 is the galactocentric cylindrical coordinate, which increases in the direction of Galactic rotation and equals\n180\u25e6 towards the Sun. We included an exponential, radial\ndecrease in density, with scale length 3.0 kpc, for R > 11.5\nkpc, in order to improve the resemblance between the\nmodel and data. The Sun is located at 8.5 kpc from the\nGalactic center; the gas follows circular rotation with a flat\nrotation curve at the level 220 km s\u22121 . Furthermore, the\nsynthetic H i spectra were broadened with a Gaussian distribution with a dispersion of 20 km s\u22121 , in order to allow,\nconservatively, for the somewhat ragged edge of the outer\nMilky Way, observed at low latitudes, and for the filamentary intermediate\u2013velocity clouds, commonly observed at\nhigher latitudes.\nFigure 4 shows the limiting VLSR corresponding to a\nVDEV of 70 km s\u22121 for this model, as function of Galactic\nlongitude and latitude. The deviation\u2013velocity approach\n\n7\n\nFig. 4. Velocities excluded from the search procedure, because of possible contamination by H i emission from the\nMilky Way gaseous layer. The deviation velocity was defined to be 70 km s\u22121 more extreme than the empirically\ndetermined extrema of the conventional gaseous layer, albeit warped and lopsided (Voskes & Burton 1999). The\nVLSR which corresponds with a VDEV of 70 km s\u22121 is\nshown as function of the Galactic longitude and latitude.\nFor each line of sight there is a negative (top) and a positive VLSR (bottom) corresponding with the given VDEV .\nBlack contours are drawn at \u00b190 and \u00b1100 km s\u22121 ; white\nones, at \u00b1150 and \u00b1200 km s\u22121 .\nwas adopted in order to eliminate contamination by the\nconventional Galactic disk, although most models of the\nanomalous\u2013velocity clouds allow these objects to pervade\nvelocities near zero km s\u22121 . The deviation\u2013velocity approach prejudices against detecting CHVCs at low velocities, but we note that they would likely remain unrecognized at low velocites in any case, because of the dominance of the ubiquitous Milky Way H i emission.\n\n4. Results\n4.1. Catalog of high\u2013velocity clouds\nTable 1 lists all 917 HVCs found in the LDS with our\nalgorithm. Due to the extent of the table it is only available electronically and not in the printed version of this\npaper. Only the first 15 columns (as defined below) are\nincluded for this table. The reader should be aware that\nnot all entries have been independently confirmed (see the\nColumn 15 description below). The subset of 116 objects\nwhich at least partially fulfill the criteria for source isolation and have been confirmed in independent observations\nare listed in Table 2. In addition to well-defined CHVCs,\nother features, likewise independently confirmed, but satisfying less stringent criteria of apparent isolation are also\nincluded in the table. Features designated with :HVC had\nsome ambiguity in their degree of isolation as ascertained\nwith the 1.5\u00d71018 cm\u22122 NHI contour in the LDS data.\nFeatures designated with ?HVC had one of a number of\nother shortcomings as detailed below; these include not\nsatisfying the VDEV > 70 km s\u22121 criterion, lying near the\nedge of the LDS survey coverage either spatially or in velocity and in some cases the presence of a significant background level.\nThe columns of the table denote the following:\nColumn 1: Running identifying number in the catalog.\nColumn 2: Designation, consisiting of a prefix, followed\nby the Galactic longitude, Galactic latitude, and Local\nStandard of Rest velocity. The prefix is CHVC for the\nclouds satisfying both of our isolation criteria; the prefix is :HVC for clouds for which the isolation is less\nclear; the prefix is ?HVC for clouds which have some\nother shortcoming (see notes) in their isolation designation; while HVC is used to indicate clouds connected\n\n\f8\n\nV. de Heij et al.: An automated search for HVCs in the LDS\n\nto extended complexes. The longitude, latitude, and\nvelocity refer to the intensity\u2013weighted averages of all\npixels which are assigned to the cloud.\nColumns 3 and 4: J2000 right ascension and declination\ncoordinates, respectively, of the position listed in column 2.\nColumns 5, 6, and 7: Radial velocities measured with\nrespect to the Local Standard of Rest, the Galactic\nStandard of Rest, and the Local Group Standard\nof Rest systems, respectively. The Galactic Standard\nof Rest reference frame is defined by VGSR =\nVLSR + 220 cos(b) sin(l); the Local Group Standard of\nRest frame, by VLGSR = VGSR \u2212 62 cos(b) cos(l) +\n40 cos(b) sin(l) \u2212 35 sin(b). The input values of l, b, and\nVLSR are those listed in column 2.\nColumn 8: Velocity FWHM of the spectrum which passes\nthrough the peak\u2013intensity pixel of the cloud.\nColumns 9, 10, and 11: Angular FWHM major axis, minor axis, and major axis position angle, respectively.\nUsing the appropriate velocity\u2013integrated moment\u2013\nmap image, an ellipse was fit to the contour with half\nthe value of the maximum column density of the cloud\n(column 13). The position angle is positive in the direction of increasing Galactic longitude, with a value\nof zero when the cloud is aligned pointing toward the\nGalactic north pole.\nColumn 12: Peak brightness temperature of the cloud.\nColumn 13: Maximum column density of the cloud in\nunits of 1020 cm\u22122 .\nColumn 14: Total flux of the cloud, in units of Jy km s\u22121 .\nColumn 15: Indications of occurances of the features in\nother catalogs of anomalous\u2013velocity clouds, coded as\nfollows, with the number in the appropriate catalog\nindicated in the table: WvW, for the Wakker & van\nWoerden (1991) analysis of the Hulsbosch & Wakker\n(1988) and Bajaja (1985) surveys; BB, for the BB99\nvisual search of the LDS; HP, for the Putman et al.\n(2002) application of the algorithm described here to\nthe HIPASS data; and WSRT, for confirming observations in this study.\nColumn 16: References to earlier studies of individual\nfeatures, and some explanatory notes. The references\nto earlier studies of the tabulated features are coded\nas follows: BB00, Braun & Burton 2000; BKP01, Br\u00fcns\net al. 2001; BBC01, Burton et al. 2001; CM79, Cohen &\nMirabel 1979; D75, Davies 1975; G81, Giovanelli 1981;\nHSP01, Hoffmann et al. 2001; H78, Hulsbosch 1978; H92,\nHenning 1992; M81, Mirabel 1981; MC79, Mirabel &\nCohen 1979; SS74, Saraber & Shane 1974; and W79,\nWright 1979. The notes carry the following meanings:\n(1) denotes objects with VDEV < 70 km s\u22121 but which\nare nevertheless entered in the catalog, for reasons explained in the following subsection; (2) denotes objects at \u03b4 < \u221228\u25e6 but which are nevertheless entered\nin the catalog, as explained in the following subsection; (3) denotes the object ?HVC 110.6 \u2212 07.0 \u2212 466\nwhich appears incompletely on the low\u2013velocity wing\nof the LDS profile but which is amply known from\n\nearlier work and therefore is entered in the catalog;\n(4) denotes an object with a Tpeak which falls just\nbelow the 5\u03c3 level of the LDS but which has been\namply confirmed in the WSRT imaging of Braun &\nBurton (2000); and (5) denotes an object which has\nan enhanced background level in excess of the nominal\n1.5\u00d71018 cm\u22122 NHI cutoff, but for which the background is sufficiently uniform to suggest that it might\nbe unrelated to the source in question.\nEach of the individual isolated objects retrieved from\nthe LDS by the search algorithm and listed in Table 2\nis illustrated in Figs. 5 \u2013 9 by an image of integrated\nH i emission, paired with a spectrum. The images show\nH i integrated over the velocity range of emission which is\nconsidered part of the cloud; the gray\u2013scale intensities are\ngiven by the color bar in units of K km s\u22121 . The associated spectrum refers to the direction in the 0.\u25e6 5 \u00d7 0.\u25e6 5 grid\nnearest to the peak of the integrated emission. Inspection\nof the Digital Sky Survey in the region of each of these\nimages did not show a clear optical counterpart for any of\nthe listed objects.\nThe arrangement on the sky of the isolated objects listed in Table 2 is shown superposed on velocity\u2013\nintegrated sky images in Fig. 10, for the velocity range\n\u2212450 < VLSR < \u2212150 km s\u22121 ; in Fig. 11, for the range\n\u2212150 < VLSR < \u221290 km s\u22121 ; and in Fig. 12, for the range\n+90 < VLSR < +150 km s\u22121 . We briefly comment on the\nsky deployment below; De Heij et al. (2002) discuss it\nmore fully in conjunction with the southern\u2013hemisphere\ncatalog.\nThe distribution of isolated object sizes and linewidths\nare shown in Fig. 13. Although the only limit on angular\nsize we have imposed is the 10\u25e6 \u00d7 10\u25e6 dimension of our\ninitial column density image of each candidate, the distribution is strongly peaked with a median at 1\u25e6 FWHM and\ndoes not extend beyond 2.\u25e6 2. Sharply bounded anomalous\u2013\nvelocity objects apparently can be well described with\nthe term: Compact High Velocity Clouds. The distribution of velocity FWHM is also strongly peaked at about\n25 km s\u22121 , although the distribution does extend out to\n100 km s\u22121 .\n\n4.2. Differences between this catalog and that of BB99\nThe BB99 compilation was based on the same data as were\nused in the preparation of Table 1 and 2, but on selection\ncriteria which were somewhat different than those of the\nalgorithm described here, and so there are several differences between the Table 2 catalog and that of BB99. The\nTable 2 catalog includes objects not found in the BB99\nlist, because it was extended to lower flux levels since new\nconfirming data were planned; conversely, a number of objects listed by BB99 were not included in the current work.\nThe differences are explained as follows:\nBB19, BB45, BB47, BB49, BB50, BB53, BB59 and\nBB60: These objects all have a VDEV less than\n\n\fV. de Heij et al.: An automated search for HVCs in the LDS\n\n9\n\nTable 1.

Images of integrated H i emission, paired with a representative spectrum for all of the fully and partially isolated\nobjects (CHVCs, :HVCs and ?HVCs) retrieved from the LDS by the search algorithm, confirmed in independent data,\nand cataloged in Table 2. The images show H i integrated over the entire velocity range of emission which is considered\npart of the cloud; the gray\u2013scale intensities are given by the color bar in units of K km s\u22121 . Contours are drawn for\nNHI = 1.5, 3, 4.5 and 6\u00d71018 cm\u22122 . The associated spectrum refers to the direction in the 0.5\u25e6 \u00d7 0.5\u25e6 grid nearest to\nthe peak of the integrated emission. The data for the images and for the spectra were extracted from the LDS, not\nfrom the independent confirming material.\ncrition of isolation was based on the 50% contour of\npeak NHI ; here we used the 1.5\u00d71018 cm\u22122 contour.\nBB17, BB20, BB24, BB28, BB33, and BB34: These\n6 objects are included in Table 2, but have been classified here as :HVCs, based on the more restrictive cri-\n\nteria of the current work.

Examples of objects which were identified as\nCHVCs by BB99, but which have been re\u2013classified following the more stringent criteria described in this paper,\nwhich measures the isolation of a feature using the NHI\ncontour at a fixed level of 1.5\u00d71018 cm\u22122 , rather than\nat the level of 50% of the peak in each object as used\nby BB99. The features shown in the upper two panels\nwere reclassified as :HVCs, thus as possible members of\nthe class of compact objects; but the features shown in\nthe two lower panels are not isolated according to the new\ncriterion, and were reclassified as HVCs. The cross in the\nlower left of each panel indicates the angular extent of a\ntrue degree on the sky. The contours are drawn at 1.5, 3,\n4.5 and 6\u00d71018 cm\u22122 ; the intensity scale is indicated by\nthe color bar, in units of K km s\u22121 .\nin Table 2, but have been classified here as ?HVCs. In\nall these cases the background NHI level exceeds our\nlimit of 1.5\u00d71018 cm\u22122 but appears smooth on angular scales of 5\u201310\u25e6 and is conceivable unrelated to the\nobject in question.\nThus of the 65 compact anomalous\u2013velocity clouds\nlisted by BB99 (excluding the nearby galaxy Cep 1), the\ncriteria applied here have resulted in the identification\nof 54; of these, 31 have retained the designation CHVC,\nwhereas 6 have been assigned the designation :HVC and\n17 have been labeled ?HVC. Some examples of reclassified\nobjects are shown in Fig. 14. Of the total of 116 compact\nobjects tabulated, 32 do not appear in the Wakker & van\nWoerden (1991) catalog; of these 32 objects, 17 are classified in Table 2 as CHVCs.\n\n4.3. Differences in the zone of overlapping declinations\nbetween this catalog and the HIPASS catalog\nPutman et al. (2002) have applied the search algorithm\ndescribed here to the HIPASS data, resulting in a catalog of southern compact, isolated objects. Because both\nthe LDS catalog of CHVCs given here in Table 2 and\nthe HIPASS catalog will be used together in an all\u2013sky\nstudy of the kinematic and spatial properties of CHVCs,\na comparison between them in the zone of overlap is interesting. The two surveys overlap in the declination range\n\u221228\u25e6 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 +2\u25e6 , but were carried out with different observational parameters. The RMS noise figure is 10 mK in\n\nthe HIPASS material, for a channel 26 km s\u22121 wide and a\nFWHP beam of 15\u2032 ; the corresponding RMS value in the\nLDS is 70 mK, for a channel width of 1.03 km s\u22121 and\na FWHP beam of 36\u2032 . After smoothing both surveys to\nthe same spectral resolution of 26 km s\u22121 , the 3\u03c3 limiting column density (for emission filling each beam) is 0.47\nand 0.64\u00d71018 cm\u22122 in the HIPASS and LDS respectively.\nThus, while the sensitivity to well-resolved sources is comparable, the point source sensitivity of HIPASS is greater\nby about a factor of 3. On the other hand, the band-pass\ncalibration of the HIPASS data relies on reference spectra\nwhich are deemed empty of H i emission that are off-set by\nonly a few degrees on the sky. Even with the MINMED5\nmethod of baseline determination employed by Putman et\nal., there is significant filtering of extended emission, which\ncomplicates the assessment of object isolation down to a\nlow column density limit.\nThe differences in point-source sensitivity on the one\nhand and sensitivity to very extended structures on the\nother, results in a larger number of faint source detections\nin HIPASS, but also in a different designation for some\nof the brighter clouds which the surveys have in common.\nComparison of the results derived by applying the search\nalgorithm to both surveys allows assessment of the robustness of the selection criteria and of the completeness of the\nLDS catalog.\nTable 3 lists the number of anomalous\u2013velocity features classified as either CHVCs or :HVCs and found in the\nindicated peak\u2013temperature bins (referred to the HIPASS\ntemperature calibration scale) in both the HIPASS and\nLDS material in the zone of overlapping declinations.\nThe data indicate the influence of survey sensitivity on\nthe number of objects found. Above a peak temperature\nof 0.45 K, the LDS results are as complete as those based\non the HIPASS; between Tpeak = 0.20 K and 0.45 K,\nthe LDS results recovered 83% of the clouds found in the\nHIPASS data. The completeness of the LDS catalog drops\nrapidly at lower values of the peak temperature: HIPASS\nclouds less bright than 0.20 K are almost completely absent from the LDS catalog. The incompleteness at low\npeak temperatures will be more important for the smaller\nCHVCs than for the somewhat less compact :HVCs. Some\nof the smaller objects have a total column density which\nis difficult to distinquish from the LDS spectral noise (see\nSubsec. 3.2). Their FWHM angular sizes are less than 25\u2032\nand they may be centered as much as 10\u2032 from the nearest\nLDS telescope pointing. The small sizes of the CHVCs and\n\n\f12\n\nV. de Heij et al.: An automated search for HVCs in the LDS\n\nFig. 9. Images of integrated H i emission, paired with a representative spectrum for all of the fully and partially\nisolated objects (CHVCs, :HVCs and ?HVCs) retrieved from the LDS by the search algorithm as in Fig.5\nFig. 10. Distribution of CHVCs found in the velocity range \u2212450 < VLSR < \u2212150 km s\u22121 across the northern\nhemisphere (left) and the portion of the southern hemisphere at \u03b4 > \u221230\u25e6 accessed by the LDS (right). Open diamonds\nindicate the locations of individual CHVCs. The gray shadings indicate the total emission in this velocity range, with\nthe color bar giving the scale in units of K km s\u22121 . Circles of constant declination are draw for \u03b4 = 0\u25e6 , \u00b130\u25e6 , and \u00b160\u25e6 .\nThe scale\u2013bar shows units of K km s\u22121 . Bright, isolated clouds in the images which are not centered within a CHVC\nsymbol are nearby galaxies. Due to the large range of integration, some individual compact clouds \u2013 of narrow width\nor otherwise of low total flux, do not clearly show up. Confirmation has proven, however, that they are real.\nFig. 11. Like Fig. 10, but with the velocity integration ranging from VLSR = \u2212150 km s\u22121 to VLSR = \u221290 km s\u22121 .\nthe less\u2013than\u2013Nyquist sampling interval of the LDS can\nconspire to result in an observation with a lower signal\u2013\nto\u2013noise ratio in the LDS than in the HIPASS.\nThe differences in sensitivity not only influence the\nnumber of sources that are detected, but also the way in\nwhich they are classified. Within the zone of overlapping\ndeclinations, 33 CHVCs were found in the HIPASS material with a peak temperature above 0.20 K. Of these\n33 sources, 19 were also found in the LDS. The appearance of these 19 sources in the LDS led 7 of them to be\nclassified as CHVCs, 7 as :HVCs, and the remaining 5 as\nHVCs. The difference in assignment is primarily due to\nthe differences in the properties of the two sets of data.\nThe possibility of a different designation is greater for the\nfainter sources. For the eight sources with a HIPASS peak\ntemperature above 0.35 K, four have a different LDS designation, whereas there is only agreement for three of the\neleven sources which are fainter than 0.35 K. Evidently\nthe differing sensitivities to compact and extended structures of the LDS and HIPASS do not allow for consistent\nclassification of the weakest objects. Figure 15 shows, as\nan example, the HIPASS data for a cloud which is seen\nin projection against an extended filament: the LDS data\nwere unable to detect the weak emission of the filament,\nand as a consequence the search algorithm applied to the\nLDS returned a CHVC designation. This example demonstrates that the classification of clouds depends on the\nsensitivity of the survey.\nIf the HIPASS and LDS catalogs are compared or if\nthey are used together, for example to investigate the all\u2013\nsky properties of the compact\u2013object ensemble, then due\nattention should be given to the higher expected detection\nrate in the southern material, and to its greater sensitivity\nto the most compact features. A straightforward merger\nof the two catalogs would neglect the higher rate of detections in the southern hemisphere and the possibly different\ndesignation of a limited number of the clouds. To correct\nfor the higher detection rate in the south, Table 3 can\nbe used to roughly estimate the likelihood that a given\ncloud which is observed in the HIPASS data also will be\nobserved in the LDS.\n\nFig. 15. Velocity\u2013integrated images of two objects which\nwere retrieved by the search algorithm both from the\nHIPASS material as reported by Putman et al. (2002) and\nfrom the LDS material discussed here, but which were\nclassified differently by the search algorithm because of\nthe differing observational parameters of the two surveys.\nThe images show the HIPASS data on the left after spatial\nsmoothing to 36 arcmin FWHM; the LDS, on the right.\nThe angular orientation and the velocity range of integration are the same for both of the paired images. For the\nobject represented in the upper pair, a classification of\nCHVC followed from the HIPASS material, but a classification of :HVC from the LDS data. The object represented\nin the lower pair of images was classified as a HVC from\nthe HIPASS material but as CHVC from the LDS. The\ncross in the lower left of each panel indicates the angular\nextent of a true degree on the sky. The contours are drawn\nat NHI = 1.5, 3, 4.5 and 6\u00d71018 cm\u22122 ; the intensity scale\nis indicated by the color bar, in units of K km s\u22121 .\n\n4.4. Completeness and homogeneity of the LDS\nsample of CHVCs\nBefore discussing some aspects of the LDS sample of\nCHVCs, a few additional remarks concerning completeness and homogeneity of the sample are in order. These\nparameters are influenced by the non\u2013Nyquist sampling\nof the LDS and its finite sensitivity,\nDue to the finite sensitivity of the LDS, we will have\nmissed clouds with peak temperatures or column densities\nbelow threshold values. After converting the HIPASS peak\ntemperatures in Table 3 to the LDS temperature scale,\nthat table can be used to estimate the number of undetected features. A comparison of the objects with detections both in the HIPASS and in the LDS listings shows\nthat the average of the ratio between the HIPASS and\nLDS peak temperatures equals 1.5. This difference can be\nunderstood in terms of the differing angular sampling intervals and resolutions of the two surveys.\nThe validity of Fig. 16 as an indication of completeness is suggested by the detection rate for known external\ngalaxies which appear in the LDS.

The peak temperatures refer to\nthe HIPASS temperature calibration.

Of the known external galaxies with |VDEV | > 70 km s\u22121 and VLSR < 350 km s\u22121 ,\nall those with a peak H i brightness temperature greater\nthan 0.13 K were found by the search algorithm. Of the 12\ngalaxies with 0.09 K \u2264 Tpeak < 0.12 K, 42% were found.\nThe temperatures and therefore sensitivities were measured at the grid points of the survey; point sources that\nare not located at a grid point will have been observed\nwith a reduced sensitivity, which depends on the telescope\nbeam and the distance to the nearest grid point. The LDS\nsampled the sky on a 0.\u25e6 5 by 0.\u25e6 5 lattice; the sensitivity\naway from the grid points falls off as a Gaussian with a\nFWHP of 36\u2032 . The results, shown in Fig. 16, lead us to\nconsider the LDS catalog to be 100% complete for point\nsources with Tpeak \u2265 0.3 K. The solid curve follows the\ntrend as indicated by the HIPASS catalog.\nObjects with H i properties like the CHVCs will be\nmissed if their emission is superposed on emission from\nintermediate\u2013 or high\u2013velocity complexes, or from our\nGalaxy. Independent of their exact origin, it is likely that\nsome of these clouds will coincide with extended emission\nof a different type. Related to this problem is the selec-\n\nFig. 16.

The full\u2013drawn line shows the expected completeness based on comparison between the results of our\nsearch and a catalog of nearby galaxies extracted from\nLEDA and the LDS. The histogram shows, for objects lying at declinations in the region of overlap of the HIPASS\nand LDS survey, the fraction of CHVCs which are listed\nboth in the HIPASS catalog of Putman et al. (2002) and in\nthe LDS catalog of Table 2. The histogram follows Table 3,\nafter transforming the HIPASS temperatures to the LDS\nscale. The average ratio of the HIPASS and LDS peak temperature for a given cloud is not unity (but equals 1.5), due\nto the differences in the spectral and spatial resolutions of\nthe two surveys.\n\ntion based on the deviation velocity of the clouds. We\nmentioned above that 12% of the BB99 sample were excluded from this study by this selection criterion. Before\nwe can properly investigate the exact influence of the obscurations or exclusion of some parts of the LDS, we have\nto model the intrinsic distribution of the CHVCs and then\nassess how they would appear in the data set. We investigate this issue in our analysis of the all-sky distribution\nof CHVCs (De Heij et al. 2002).\nAlthough the part of the LDS that was searched only\ncovered the sky within the velocity interval VLSR = \u2212450\nkm s\u22121 to +350 km s\u22121 , there are indications that we do\nnot miss many (if any) clouds because of the velocity interval. The high\u2013velocity feature with the most extreme\nnegative velocity yet found is HVC 110.6 \u2212 07.0 \u2212 466,\ndiscoverd by Hulsbosch (1978) and subject to substantial subsequent observation as referenced in Table 2. The\nWakker & van Woerden tabulation, which relied on survey data covering the range \u2212900 km s\u22121 to +750 km s\u22121 ,\nfound no high\u2013velocity cloud at a more negative velocity. The HIPASS search reported by Putman et al.\n(2002) sought anomalous\u2013velocity emission over the range\n\u2212700 < V LSR < +1000 km s\u22121 . Of the 194 HIPASS\nCHVCs cataloged by Putman et al., ten have VLSR <\n\u2212300, but the most extreme negative velocity is \u2212353\nkm s\u22121 . This CHVC, namely CHVC 125.1 \u2212 66.4 \u2212 353 occurs, not surprisingly, in the quadrant where the northern\ndata shows a preference for extreme negative velocities.\nThe north/south kinematic asymmetries are a well\u2013\nknown property of the anomalous\u2013velocity H i .

The LDS does not reach low enough declinations to embrace the anti\u2013barycenter region, although\nthe feature in Table 2 with the highest positive velocity,\n:HVC 357.5 + 05.6 + 268 is well removed from the direction of the barycenter1 . Of the 194 CHVCs in the HIPASS\ncatalog, only 7 have VLSR greater than +300 km s\u22121 , and\nonly one has a velocity greater than 350 km s\u22121 , namely\nCHVC 258.2 \u2212 23.9 + 359. All of the seven CHVCs with\nsubstantial positive velocities lie deep in the third longitude quadrant, or in the fourth; the mean longitude of\nthese seven CHVCs is 278\u25e6 , 185\u25e6 removed from the longitude appropriate for the solar apex motion in the Local\nGroup Standard of Rest reference frame as determined by\nKarachentsev & Makorov (1996), and whichthus roughly\ncorresponds with the direction of the Local Group anti\u2013\nbarycenter. The Wakker & van Woerden compilation lists\nno high\u2013velocity feature with a more positive velocity than\nthat of their HVC 305.0 \u2212 10.0 + 312, also in the general\ndirection preferentially represented by positive velocites.\nIn view of these detection statistics, we consider it unlikely that the velocity range of the LDS has caused a\nsignificant number of features to be missed at the declinations observed. In other words, the true velocity extent,\n1\n\nAlthough none of the compact H i clouds listed in Table 2\nshowed an obvious optical counterpart in our perusal of the\nDSS, it is not yet firmly ruled out that the listing might be\ncontaminated by an obscured nearby galaxy, as yet undetected\nat optical or infrared wavelengths. Two of the features listed\nin our catalog appear particularly suspicious in this regard,\nnamely :HVC 357.5 + 05.6 + 268 and CHVC 004.4 + 05.7 + 202.\nBoth are located along sight lines traversing the Galactic\nBulge, and thus lie in directions of exceptionally high optical obscuration, and both deviate strongly from the kinematic\npatterns defined by the other members of the ensemble. This\ndeviation is particularly evident in Fig. 17, a figure of the sort\nfrequently used to establish membership in the Local Group.\n\nas well as the non\u2013zero mean in the LSR frame, of the\nanomalous\u2013velocity ensemble appear well represented by\nthe extrema of \u2212466 km s\u22121 and +359 km s\u22121 .\n\n5. Discussion\n5.1. What defines a CHVC?\nThe concept of a distinct class of compact, isolated high\u2013\nvelocity clouds has emerged from the visual inspection of\nlarge area images of good sensitivity and spatial sampling\nlike the LDS in the north and the HIPASS in the south.\nThere appears to be a class of high-contrast features which\nare at best only marginally resolved with half degree angular resolution and that can not easily be distinguished\nfrom the H i signature of an external galaxy. The H i signature of an external galaxy in the LDS (see Figure 15 of\nHartmann & Burton 1997) is a moderately high peak column density of a few times 1019 cm\u22122 or more (averaged\nover the 36 arcmin beam), an H i FWHM linewidth varying between 20 and 375 km s\u22121 commensurate with the\ngalaxy mass and inclination, and a sharply bounded angular extent, such that emission at column densities above\na few times 1018 cm\u22122 is confined to less than about 2\u25e6\ndiameter.\nThis last fact is of particular physical relevance, since\nthe precipitous decline in H i column density seen at the\nedges of nearby galaxies can be understood as arising\nfrom photo\u2013ionization due to the intergalactic radiation\nfield. Detailed studies of individual systems (NGC3198 by\nMaloney 1993, M33 by Corbelli & Salpeter 1993) show\nthat an exponential decline in neutral column density,\nwith a scale\u2013length of about 1 kpc sets in below a critical\ncolumn density of about 2\u00d71019 cm\u22122 . This neutral column density is comparable to the Warm Neutral Medium\nlayer (with a temperature of about 8000 K) required to\nprovide sufficient shielding from UV and soft X-ray radiation such that condensation of Cool Neutral Medium\nclumps (with temperature of about 100 K) can take place\n(e.g. Wolfire et al. 1995a) for ambient thermal pressures\ncomparable to, or less than, those found in the solar neighbourhood. The picture that emerges is a nested structure\nof CNM cores, shielded by WNM cocoons and surrounded\nby a Warm Ionized Medium halo. For nearby galaxies the\nWNM cocoon at the edge of the gaseous disk has an observed exponential scale-length of about 1 kpc (Maloney\n1993; Corbelli & Salpeter 1993). The exponential scalelength of the partially ionized WNM cocoon is determined\nby both the total column density distribution and the incident ionizing spectrum. For smooth distributions of total\ncolumn density and a wide range of power\u2013law spectral indices, Corbelli & Salpeter (1993) find neutral scale\u2013lengths\nof about 1 kpc. The reason that this transition zone is so\nmuch more extended than in a classical H ii region is found\nin the wide range of photon energies, and hence penetrating depths, of the ionizing spectrum.\nIt is not obvious that all of these considerations need\napply to the population of high\u2013velocity clouds. If the\n\n\fV. de Heij et al.: An automated search for HVCs in the LDS\n\nHVCs are near the Galactic disk, then they will be subject to severe tidal distortions of their intrinsic gas distributions and be exposed to variable ionizing radiation\nlevels depending on local circumstances. Due to changing\nphysical conditions it is conceivable that thermal and pressure equilibrium may not be achieved. The requirements\nfor achieving such equilibrium have been considered by\nWolfire et al. (1995b), who conclude that even for heights\nabove the Galactic plane of only 3 kpc, thermal equilibrium should be marginally achieved within the WNM and\neasily within the CNM at an infall velocity as high as\n150 km s\u22121 . At larger distances the requirements that the\nthermal timescale be shorter than the time to experience\nsignificant pressure variations are even more easily satisfied. It thus seems reasonable to expect that high\u2013velocity\nclouds might also be described by CNM clumps within a\nWNM shielding cocoon surrounded by WIM halos. If such\nobjects occur at distances greater than about 60 kpc, tidal\neffects would be less disruptive, the UV radiation field\nwould be more nearly isotropic, and an H i concentration\nof about 2 kpc diameter would have an angular size of less\nthan 2\u25e6 .\n\n5.2. Application of a digital filter to the LDS\nMotivated by the distinctive visual appearance of sharply\nbounded H i peaks in the LDS data, we have considered\nwhether a simple digital filtering might not serve to isolate a subset of these features from the general H i emission of the Galaxy and the HVC complexes, and in so doing offer independent confirmation of the results achieved\nwith the procedure outlined in \u00a73. We considered a two\u2013\ndimensional discrete derivative convolving kernel, consisting of a delta function at the origin together with a negative ring of unit integral at a radius of 1\u25e6 . After evaluating\nthe convolution of each channel map with this kernel, we\nnormalize the result by the original intensity, wherever\nthis exceeds some minimum significance:\nF (x, y) =\n\n1 dI\nI dr\n\n(2)\n\nfor I > n\u03c3. As an illustration, this filter was applied\nto an Aitoff-projected cube of the LDS data centered\nat (l, b) = (123\u25e6 , 0\u25e6 ) after a velocity smoothing to 25\nkm s\u22121 FWHM, and restricted to intensities exceeding\n10\u03c3, corresponding to 0.14 K brightness. The peak filtered\nresponse was then determined along each spectrum; this is\nillustrated as the greyscale in Figure 18 for values exceeding 0.85 in units of the normalized derivative. Overlaid on\nthe peak filter values are square symbols at the positions\nof 59 cataloged external galaxies. Of these 59 nearby H i \u2013\nemitting galaxies, 57 are listed in Table 4 of Hartmann &\nBurton (1997); the remaining two are Dwingeloo 1, discovered by Kraan\u2013Korteweg et al. (1994), and Cepheus 1,\ndiscovered by Burton et al. (1999). Open circles in this figure show the positions of the 116 CHVCs which we catalog\nhere; crosses show the positions of 72 CHVC candidates\nwhich were not confirmed in subsequent observations, and\n\n15\n\ntriangles show the positions of 84 CHVC candidates for\nwhich no confirming observations have yet been obtained.\nIt is striking how the vast majority of both normal Galactic and HVC complex emission has been eliminated by this simple filtering. About half of the peaks\nreturned by the normalized derivative filter have an over\u2013\nplotted symbol corresponding either to a cataloged external galaxy or to a CHVC. The 18 cataloged galaxies and 39\nCHVCs which do not have a strong filter response can all\nbe understood in terms of a poorly matched velocity width\n(since objects well\u2013matched with a 25 km s\u22121 FWHM were\nselected in this case) or a very low peak brightness (that\nis, below the cut\u2013off of 0.14 K). In addition to the filter\npeaks with over\u2013plotted symbols there are a similar number, about 140 peaks, exceeding 0.85 in the normalized\nspatial derivative without an overplotted identification.\nCloser inspection of these additional filter peaks reveals\nthat they all correspond to sub\u2013structure within more extended HVC complexes. These are quite distinct from the\nCHVCs in that they are not are not sharply bounded at\na column density of 1.5\u00d71018 cm\u22122 , but instead are connected (at least in projected position\u2013velocity space) to\nmore extended HVC complexes at a higher column density.\n\n5.3. Brief remarks on the spatial and kinematic\ndeployment of the northern CHVCs\nIn a separate paper (De Heij et al. 2002), we analyse the\nLDS CHVC sample merged with the sample identified by\nPutman et al. (2002) in the southern hemisphere HIPASS\nmaterial. Here we briefly note the global properties of the\ncompact objects found in the LDS.\nFigure 18 shows the distribution on the sky of the compact, isolated objects cataloged in Table 2. The objects are\ndistributed rather uniformly across the northern sky. In\nparticular, there is no clear sign of a preference in the sky\ndistribution either for the Galactic disk, or for most of the\nknown high\u2013velocity cloud complexes, or the Magellanic\nStream. One exception to this general conclusion is an\napparent concentration centered near (l,b)=(25,\u221230), a\nregion which Wakker & Van Woerden (1991) identify\nwith their Galactic Center Negative Velocity Population\nof HVCs. This region appears to be particuarly rich in\ncompact objects statisfying very stringent requirements\nfor isolation in column density. For comparison, the distribution of all nearby galaxies detected in the LDS data\nis also plotted in the figure.\nFigure 19 shows the velocities of all of the compact\nclouds cataloged in Table 2, calculated for three different\nreference frames and plotted as function of the Galactic\nlongitude. The velocity dispersion of the sample decreases\nfrom 174 km s\u22121 , to 101 km s\u22121 , and then to 97 km s\u22121 ,\nin going from the reference frame of the Local Standard of\nRest, to that of the Galactic Standard of Rest, and then\nto that of the Local Group Standard of Rest. The average velocity changes from \u2212191 km s\u22121 , to \u2212127 km s\u22121 ,\n\n\f16\n\nV. de Heij et al.: An automated search for HVCs in the LDS\n\nFig. 18. Distribution on the sky of the compact anomalous\u2013velocity objects (CHVCs) found by application of the\nsearch algorithm and selection criteria to the Leiden/Dwingeloo Survey. The background greyscale is the output of a\nspatial derivative filter to the LDS data (matched to the median cloud linewidth and angular size) where this exceeds\n0.85 in units of the normalized derivative. Overlaid are square symbols at the positions of 59 cataloged external\ngalaxies, open circles for the 116 CHVCs which we catalog here; crosses at the positions of 72 CHVC candidates\nwhich were not confirmed in subsequent observations, and triangles at the positions of 84 CHVC candidates for which\nno confirming observations have yet been obtained. The CHVCs are not strongly clumped in the northern sky; and\nin particular show no concentration toward the extended HVC complexes or Magellanic Stream but do show some\nconcentration toward the region near (l,b)=(25\u25e6 ,\u221230\u25e6 ) which has previously been called the Galactic Center Negative\nvelocity population. The solid curve indicates the nominal \u03b4 = \u221230\u25e6 cut-off of the LDS coverage.\nFig. 19. Kinematic deployment of the compact\u2013object\nsample plotted as a function of the galactic longitude for\nthree different kinematic reference frames, compared with\nthe kinematic distribution of Local Group galaxies. The\nCHVCs are shown as triangles; the less\u2013constrained :HVC\nand ?HVC objects as diamonds and squares, respectively.\nThe kinematic distribution of the Local Group galaxies\ntabulated by Mateo (1998) is traced by the filled circles.\nThere is a decrease in the average velocity of the compact\u2013\nobject ensemble, as well as in the velocity dispersion, when\nprogressing from the Local Standard of Rest system (upper panel), to the Galactic Standard of Rest system (middle panel), to the Local Group Standard of Rest system\n(lower panel).\nand then to \u2212117 km s\u22121 , for the three different reference\nframes, respectively. Although the differences between the\nGalactic and Local Group system are not very large, the\nvalues are lower in the Local Group coordinate system.\nInclusion of the data of the southern hemisphere in the\nanalysis has to indicate if the small difference is significant\nor not. The difference of 10 km s\u22121 between the velocity\ndispersion in the LGSR reference frame found by BB99\nand that found here is probably due to the differences in\nthe samples used, with the BB99 one being smaller.\n\n5.4. Summary and Conclusions\nAn automated procedure has been developed to extract\nanomalous\u2013velocity clouds from H i survey material. We\nhave applied the algorithm to the Leiden/Dwingeloo survey and catalog the properties of a total of 917 HVC features with a deviation velocity in excess of 70 km s\u22121 .\nSince the algorithm requires the existence of a local maximum in position\u2013velocity which is distinct from the bulk\nof Galactic emission, the catalog can not be usefully extended to include the intermediate velocity clouds which\nare strongly blended with the Galaxy. We have searched\nour HVC catalog for all isolated clouds, defined by having a lowest significant column density contour (3\u03c3 \u223c\n1.5\u00d71018 cm\u22122 ) which is (1) closed, with its greatest radial\nextent less than 10\u25e6 by 10\u25e6 ; and (2) not elongated in the\ndirection of any nearby extended emission. A total of 116\nobjects have been tabulated which at least partially satisfy these criteria. Independent confirmation is available\n\nfor all of these clouds, some of which appear in only single\nspectra in the LDS. Of the 116 clouds, 54 had been identified as CHVCs by Braun & Burton (1999), some others\nhad been detected in earlier work referenced in the catalog but are confirmed as isolated by the data and analysis\npresented here, and others are reported here for the first\ntime.\nAlthough objects as large as 10\u25e6 were permitted by\nour selection criteria, the resulting distribution is strongly\npeaked at a median value of 1\u25e6 FWHM and has a maximum observed diameter of only 2..\u25e6 2. Isolated HVCs are\nobserved to be relatively compact. Conversely, although\nthe well known HVC complexes exhibit a wealth of smallscale structure that is comparable in angular scale (\u223c 1\u25e6 )\nthese structures are not isolated. The local maxima within\nthe HVC complexes are surrounded by extended emission\nwith column densities in the range 5 \u2212 20\u00d71018 cm\u22122 .\nThe significance of high galactic latitude H i features\nwhich are isolated in column density down to a level as low\nas 1.5\u00d71018 cm\u22122 , is that this is about an order of magnitude lower than the critical column density identified\nat the edges of nearby galaxies (Maloney 1993, Corbelli &\nSalpeter 1993), \u223c2\u00d71019 cm\u22122 , where the ionized fraction\nis thought to increase dramatically due to the extragalactic radiation field. Unless very contrived geometries are\ninvoked of some unseen population of high column density absorbers, these objects will need to provide their own\nshielding to ionizing radiation. (This point has also been\nmade by Hoffman et al. 2001.) Self-consistent calculations\nof the ionization balance in the shielding layer exposed\nto a power\u2013law extragalactic ionizing photon field yield\na typical H i exponential scale\u2013length of 1 kpc (Corbelli\n& Salpeter 1993). The small median angular size of the\nCHVCs, of about 1\u25e6 FWHM, might then imply substantial distances, greater than about 120 kpc.\nThe kinematic and spatial deployment of the enlarged\nsample shows that both the Galactic Standard of Rest and\nthe Local Group Standard of Rest frames substantially\nlower the velocity dispersion of the population. This also\nlends support to the hypothesis that the CHVCs are a distant component of the high\u2013velocity cloud phenomenon,\nat substantial distances and with a net in\u2013fall towards the\nGalaxy or the Local Group barycenter.\nA more complete analysis of the kinematic and spatial deployment of the all\u2013sky CHVC ensemble incoporates both the LDS sample and the results of a compara-\n\n\fV. de Heij et al.: An automated search for HVCs in the LDS\n\nble search by Putman et al.
