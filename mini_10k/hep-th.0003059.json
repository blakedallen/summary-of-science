Using the AdS/CFT correspondence in the classical approximation, the amplitudes are shown to be related to minimal surfaces\ngeneralizing the helicoid in various AdS5 backgrounds.

In the conformal case the absence of confinement leads to a different solution. A\ntransition between both regimes appears, in a confining theory, when\nvarying impact parameter.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe theoretical calculation from \"first principles\" of high energy scattering amplitudes in the so-called \"soft\" regime of QCD is among the\noldest and yet unsolved problem of strong interaction physics. The\nmain reason is that it requires a good understanding of 4-dimensional\ngauge field theories at strong coupling which we do not possess till\nnow. In view of the recent developments of the AdS/CFT correspondence [1, 2] it is thus natural to address this problem in the new setting\nproposed in this way. An exact correspondence for QCD is not yet\nknown, however useful information can be obtained from known realizations for confining theories.\nWe would like to discuss relevant physical properties of scattering\namplitudes at high energy expected from the S-Matrix theory of strong\ninteractions [3]. In particular, Reggeization of scattering amplitudes\nis expected to occur, i.e. high-energy two-body amplitudes behaving as A(s, t) = s\u03b1(t) \u00d7 (pref actors), where s, t are the well-known\nMandelstam variables. \u03b1(t) is the Regge trajectory corresponding to\nsingularities of partial waves at j = \u03b1(t) in the t-channel. Unitarity,\nanalyticity and crossing relations implied by the S-Matrix theory impose constraints on \u03b1(t). In particular the Froissart bound [4] implies\nthat \u03b1(t = 0) \u2264 1 and the prefactors of the amplitude are at most like\nlog2 s. Note that the Froissart bound assumes an underlying confining\nfield theory, or at least a mass gap, since the scale of the bound is\nfixed by the particle of smallest mass (e.g. the pion).\nIn [5], we considered large impact parameter and high energy scattering of colourless states for SU (N ) supersymmetric gauge theories\nin the strong coupling, large N limit using the AdS/CFT correspondence. The gauge theory scattering amplitude is linked with a correlation function of tilted Wilson loops elongated along the light-cone\ndirections [6, 7, 8, 9]. In the AdS/CFT correspondence, these correlation functions are related to minimal surfaces in the AdS5 geometry\nwhich have the Wilson loops as boundaries. The case considered in\nour previous paper Ref. [5] involved disjoint minimal surfaces and thus\nthe necessity of including supergravity field exchanges between the two\ncorresponding string worldsheets. The dominant contributions were\nidentified and all correspond to real phase shifts, i.e. purely elastic\nscattering. In particular, the contribution of the bulk graviton gives\nan unexpected \"gravity-like\" s1 behaviour of the gauge theory phase\nshift in a specific range of energies and (very) large impact parameters.\n\n2\n\n\fThe main but stringent difficulty which limited the scope of Ref. [5]\nwas that the weak field approximation in supergravity was shown to be\nbroken unless the impact parameter L was sufficiently large, namely\nL\n2/7 , where a is the transverse extension of the Wilson loop. If\na \u226b s\nthe above condition is not met, the produced gravitational field in the\ndual AdS theory becomes strong, preventing perturbative calculations\nto be done in this background.\nWe will concentrate on a situation where the difficulty with supergravity field exchanges does not arise, since there exists a single\nconnected minimal surface which gives the dominant contribution to\nthe scattering amplitude in the strong coupling regime, i.e. when\n\u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0. This will allow us to extend our study to small impact parameters, where inelastic channels are expected to play an important\nr\u00f4le.\nIn this approach we will start by considering the correlation function of two Wilson lines elongated along the two light-cone directions, a configuration which can be used for the description of highenergy quark-quark or quark-antiquark amplitudes in gauge theories [6, 7, 8]. The r\u00f4le of the quarks in the AdS/CFT correspondence\nwill be played, as in [10], by the massive W bosons arising from breaking U (N + 1) \u2192 U (N ) \u00d7 U (1). The case of IR finite correlators of\nWilson loops will be dealt with in a second stage.\nThe plan of our paper is as follows: in section 2, we will analyze\nthe correlation function of Wilson lines leading to an evaluation of\nq q\u0304 and qq scattering amplitudes at high energy. This will be done in\nthe context of the black hole geometry in AdS space [11] (static Wilson loops were first studied in this background in [12, 13]), where one\ncan use a flat metric as a good approximation scheme near the horizon. We analyze the factorizable structure of the IR divergences and\nisolate a cut-off independent inelastic amplitude leading to reggeization. In section 3, we consider the so-called \"conformal\" case of the\nAdS/CFT correspondence for N = 4 supersymmetric SU (N ) gauge\ntheory, where the AdS5 metric gives rise to a different minimal surface\nsolution. The problem of the cancelation of the infra-red divergences\nis analyzed by considering Wilson loop correlators in section 4, leading to the (approximate) derivation of scattering amplitudes between\ncolourless states, while the conclusions and open problems are pointed\nout in the final section.\n\n3\n\n\f2 Wilson lines and minimal surfaces\nin \"quasi-flat\" geometry\nt\n\n\u03b8\n\ny\n\nT\nL\nT\nx\n\nFigure 1: Geometry of the Wilson lines in euclidean space.\nLet us start by defining an appropriate gauge theory observable\nfor q q\u0304 scattering amplitudes A(s, t). It is convenient to pass from\ntransverse momentum t = \u2212q 2 to impact parameter space\nZ\ni\n1\nA(s, t) =\nd2 l eiq*l \u00c3(s, l)\n(1)\ns\n2\u03c0\nwhere l is the 2-dimensional impact parameter (in the following we\nwill denote its modulus by L), and \u00c3 is the amplitude in the impact\nparameter space.\nIn the eikonal approximation the impact parameter space amplitude for q q\u0304 scattering is given by a correlation function of two Wilson\nlines [6, 7, 8] which follow the classical straight line quark trajectories\nW1 \u2212\u2192 x\u03bc1 = p\u03bc1 \u03c4 and W2 \u2212\u2192 x\u03bc2 = x\u03bc\u22a5 + p\u03bc2 \u03c4 , with |x\u22a5 | = L, see\nFig.1. The IR cut-off will correspond to a fixed temporal extent of the\nlines \u2212T < \u03c4 < +T .\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence gives a recipe [10, 14] for calculating this correlation function through\n1\n\nhW1 W2 i \u2261 \u00c3(s, l) = e\u2212 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 Aminimal\n\n4\n\n(2)\n\n\fq\nwhere hW1 W2 i is the Wilson line correlator1 , \u03b1\u2032 = 1/ 2gY2 M N in\nunits of the AdS radius, and Aminimal is the area of the minimal\nsurface in the appropriate background geometry (e.g. AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 for\nthe conformal N = 4 SYM, an AdS black hole [11, 12, 13] among\nother geometries [15] for confining theories) bounded by the Wilson\nline segments limited by the cut-off T. A different approach to discuss\nthe minimal surface problem in the conformal AdS5 was considered in\n[16], which concentrated on the elastic part of the amplitude.\nSince the disjoint contour formed by the two Wilson line segments\nis not closed, the procedure for finding a minimal surface is ambiguous. We will adopt a prescription for finding the minimal surface for\ninfinitely long lines and then truncating it to a finite temporal extent\nparameterized by the IR cutoff T . This implicitly consists of forming\na \"big\" Wilson loop closed at large temporal distance by curves drawn\non the infinite minimal surface.\nIn turn, this procedure defines the appropriate colour decomposition of the associated amplitude. Using the well known colour decomposition taij takl = \u22121/2N \u03b4ij \u03b4kl + 1/2\u03b4il \u03b4jk , we have\n\u001b\n\u001a\n1\n\u00c3(s, l) \u2261 N \u00c30 (s, l) + \u00c3N 2\u22121 (s, l)\n2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u00c30 (resp. \u00c3N 2 \u22121 ) are the amplitudes in the singlet (resp. adjoint) representations.\nUsing the same strategy as in our first paper [5], we will perform the\ncalculation with euclidean signature for Wilson lines in the boundary\nR4 forming a relative angle \u03b8 in the longitudinal plane and then we\nwill make an analytical continuation into Minkowski space by rotating\nthe euclidean time coordinate clockwise and the angle anticlockwise\n(see [17] in this context):\n\u03b8 \u2212\u2192 \u2212i\u03c7 \u223c \u2212i log\nT\n\n\u2212\u2192 iT .\n\ns\nm2\n(4)\n\nNote that a priori there is an ambiguity in making the analytical\ncontinuation depending on the precise choice of the path. This phenomenon did not appear in the context of large impact parameter near\nforward scattering discussed in [5] since there, the hW W i correlation\n1\n\nThe free propagation of the q and q\u0304 states is not included in the correlator hW1 W2 i,\nwhich is thus implicitly normalized by 1/ hW1 i hW2 i.\n\n5\n\n\ffunction had only simple poles in the complex \u03b8 plane. In the case\nconsidered in this paper the analyticity structure contains branch cuts\nin the complex plane which have to be taken into account.\n\nAdS black hole solution and its flat space approximation\nIn [11] a proposal was made that a confining gauge theory is dual to\nstring theory in an AdS black hole (BH) background the relevant part\nof which can be written as\nds2BH =\n\n16 1 dz 2 \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd\n+\n+ ...\n9 f (z) z 2\nz2\n\n(5)\n\nwhere f (z) = z 2/3 (1 \u2212 (z/R0 )4 ) and R0 is the position of the horizon2 .\nAlthough it was later found that the S 1 KK states do not strictly\ndecouple in the interesting limits [18], we will use this background to\nstudy the interplay between the confining nature of gauge theory and\nits reggeization properties. Actually the qualitative arguments and\napproximations should be generic for most confining backgrounds3 , as\nalready discussed in Ref. [15, 21].\nIn order to calculate the scattering amplitude, we have to evaluate the correlation function (2). Therefore we put the two tilted lines\ndepicted in Fig. 1 on the boundary at z = 0. Next we have to find\nthe minimal surface in the appropriate geometry which has the two\nlines as its boundaries. The relative angle (tilt) in the t-y plane and\nthe separation in the transverse direction x (impact parameter) therefore define the boundary conditions for the geodesic equations for the\nstring.\nAs is well known for the Plateau problem of minimal surfaces [22]\nthe boundary conditions determine the solutions. Although an exact\nsolution for the minimal surface spanned by the tilted Wilson lines\nis unknown for the metric (5), the properties of the black hole (BH)\ngeometry allow for quite a good approximation scheme.\nTwo salient features of the metric (5) are (i) the standard AdS\nprefactor 1/z 2 close to the boundary (z = 0), (ii) the existence of\n2\n\nCompared to standard coordinates [13] we used U = z \u22124/3 and UT = R0 .\n3\nTwo other geometries for (supersymmetric) confining theories have been discussed\nrecently [19, 20]. They have the property that for small z, i.e. close to the boundary, the\ngeometry looks like AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 (in [20] up to logarithmic corrections related to asymptotic\nfreedom) giving a coulombic q q\u0304 potential. For large z the geometry is effectively flat. In\nall cases there is a scale, similar to R0 above, which marks a transition between the small\nz and large z regimes.\n\u22124/3\n\n6\n\n\fHORIZON\n\nBoundary\n\nFigure 2: The minimal surface in the black hole geometry.

A consequence\nof (i) is that it is most efficient for a minimal surface to perform the\n\"twisting\" between the two Wilson lines as far away from the boundary\nas possible. Property (ii) effectively induces this twisting to occur near\nthe horizon as we shall show below.\nThe appropriate minimal surface in the BH geometry will look\nas follows. Due to property (i), the minimal surface between well\nseparated lines rises \"vertically\" in the z direction up to the horizon\nwithout sizable motion in the other R4 coordinates (see a schematic\nrepresentation in Fig. 2). The metric at the horizon is effectively flat\nds2\u223chorizon \u223c\n\n1\n(\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd ) ,\nR02\n\n(6)\n\nand the motion in the z direction is \"frozen out\". Now near the horizon, following property (ii), the minimal surface performs the \"twisting\" (not displayed in Fig. 2) corresponding to the tilt angle \u03b8 between\nthe initial Wilson lines. At this stage we thus have to find a minimal\nsurface between the lines at an angle \u03b8 in the flat space metric (6).\nFinally the surface falls off again vertically towards the boundary. The\narea of the \"vertical\" pieces is removed by the standard subtractions\n[10], so the resulting area which enters the formula for the amplitude\n(2) may be approximated by the area of the \"flat space\" piece.\nWe will now substantiate this intuitive picture with a more quantitative study of the geodesic equation for the string. Let us determine\nunder what conditions the minimal surface spanned by the two tilted\n\n7\n\n\fWilson lines is indeed predominantly flat and concentrated near the\nhorizon following the general line of discussion of [15].\nThe minimal surface equations follow from the Nambu-Goto action.\nZ l(\u03c4 )/2 p\nZ T\n1\n(7)\nS=\nd\u03c4\ndet hab ,\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 \u2212T\n\u2212l(\u03c4 )/2\nwhere the induced metric on the worldsheet is\nhab \u2261 Gij\n\n\u2202X i (\u03c3, \u03c4 ) \u2202X j (\u03c3, \u03c4 )\n.\n\u2202v a\n\u2202v b\n\n(8)\n\nX i stands for general coordinates (z, x\u03bc )\u221a\nin (5), Gij is the background\nmetric, v 0 \u2261 \u03c3, v 1 \u2261 \u03c4 , and l(\u03c4 ) = L2 + \u03b8 2 \u03c4 2 is the euclidean\ndistance between points on the two Wilson lines with the same value\nof the time coordinate \u03c4 .\nAs a first remark we note that using the background metric (5)\nthe terms in the induced metric h\u03c3\u03c3 corresponding to the twisting are\nof the form\n\"\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u00132 #\n\u2202t\n\u2202y 2\n1\n+\n.\n(9)\n2\nz\n\u2202\u03c3\n\u2202\u03c3\nHence, near the boundary (z \u2192 0), the minimization will not change\nnoticeably the twist angle. Thus the boundary conditions are \"frozen\"\nand transported to the vicinity of the horizon.\nFor further discussion we shall make an approximation (similar to\n[16]) of neglecting explicit \u03c4 dependence in the Euler-Lagrange equations following from (7) and leaving it only in the implicit dependence\non the boundary conditions through l(\u03c4 ). Within this approximation\nthe estimate of [15], made for the case of the static q q\u0304 potential may\nbe directly applied to our problem.\nIn reference [15] a distance d is defined, for all metrics giving confinement, which measures the transverse distance (on the boundary)\nover which the string worldsheet significantly deviates from being flat.\nIn all cases the ratio d/l(\u03c4 ) \u2212\u2192 0 when l(\u03c4 ) \u2192 \u221e.. Depending on\nthe confining metric considered, d behaves as a logarithm or a power\nof l(\u03c4 ) smaller than one. It is interesting to note that the condition\nd/l(\u03c4 ) \u226a 1 leads to a lower bound on the impact parameter L since\nthe above condition is most restrictive for the smallest value of l(\u03c4 ),\nwhich is equal to L.\nThe precise dependence of d(l(\u03c4 )) on the horizon scale R0 depends\non the metric considered. For instance for the metric (5) rescaling\n\n8\n\n\f2/3\n\narguments lead to a dependence d(l(\u03c4 )) \u223c R0 log l(\u03c4 ). Therefore as\nlong as the impact parameter is large with respect to R0 the approximations considered in this section should be valid.\nHowever, it may of course happen that the impact parameter distance between the two Wilson lines becomes much smaller than R0 .\nIn this case (see Fig. 2) the minimal surface problem becomes less\naffected by the black hole geometry (or the large z behaviour of the\ndifferent metrics [19, 20]) and will just probe the small z region of the\ngeometry.\nThe precise behaviour at these shorter distances will depend on\nthe type of gauge theory and, in particular, on the small z limit of\nthe appropriate metric. In this paper we will consider the generic\ncase (from the 4D (S)YM point of view) when this limit resembles the\noriginal AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 geometry [1]. We will consider this conformal (non\nconfining) regime in detail in a further section. We note that the same\nbehaviour can be equivalently obtained through rescaling, by keeping\nthe impact parameter fixed and putting the scale R0 \u2192 \u221e.\nLet us concentrate in the following on the case when the impact\nparameter is larger than the scale R0 . To summarize the discussion,\nthe string is then to a large degree concentrated in the region near\nthe horizon (6) with the boundary conditions essentially transported\nfrom z = 0. We are thus led first to calculate the area of the minimal\nsurface bounded by the tilted lines in the flat geometry (6) at the\nhorizon. We will first perform the calculation in euclidean signature\nand then perform the analytical continuation (4).\n\nHelicoid geometry\nThe basic building block of our construction is a minimal surface\nspanned by two straight line segments of length 2T, corresponding\nto the two Wilson lines separated by a distance L in the \"transverse\"\ndirection x and with a relative angle \u03b8 in the \"longitudinal\" plane:\nL1 : \u03c4 \u2212\u2192 (\u03c4, 0, 0, 0)\n\nL2 : \u03c4 \u2212\u2192 (\u03c4 cos \u03b8, \u03c4 sin \u03b8, 0, L).\n\n(10)\n\nIt is well-known that in the flat R4 geometry the minimal surface\nwith infinite boudaries \u03c4 = \u2212\u221e . . .+\u221e is a helicoid. We will also be\ninterested by the \"truncated\" helicoid4 where \u03c4 = \u2212T . . . T .\n4\n\nFor finite cut-off T in flat space, the truncated helicoid obviously remains a solution\nif one adds the boundary helices at \u03c4 = \u2212T, T as new boundaries. Note, however, that\n\n9\n\n\fLet us recall the minimal surface solution in flat space. The helicoid is the only regulated (spanned by straight lines) minimal surface.\nThe truncated helicoid solution may be parametrized by\n\u03b8\u03c3\nL\n\u03b8\u03c3\ny = \u03c4 sin\nL\nx = \u03c3\nt = \u03c4 cos\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03c4 = \u2212T . . . T and \u03c3 = 0 . . . L and \u03b8 is the total twisting angle.\nIts area is given by the formula\nr\nZ T\nZ L\n\u03c4 2 \u03b82\nd\u03c4 1 + 2 =\nd\u03c3\nArea \u2261 S(T ) =\nL\n\u2212T\n0\nq\nr\n2\n2\n1 + TL2\u03b8 + \u03b8 TL\nT 2 \u03b8 2 L2\n= LT 1 +\n+\nlog q\n.\n(12)\n2 2\nL2\n2\u03b8\n1 + T \u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8T\nL2\n\nL\n\nLet us now perform the analytical continuation (4), which links euclidean correlation functions in gauge theories with minkowskian ones\ndirectly related to scattering amplitudes. A naive continuation of the\narea formula (12) leads to a pure phase factor in (2):\nq\n\uf8f1q\n\uf8ee r\n\uf8f9\uf8fc\nT 2 \u03c72\nT \uf8fd\n\uf8f2 2gY2 M N\n2\n2\n2\n+\n\u03c7\n1\n+\nT \u03c7\nL\nL\nL2\n\uf8fb ,\ni \uf8f0LT 1 +\n+\nlog q\nexp\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\uf8f3 2\u03c0R0\nL\n2\u03c7\nT \u03c7\nT \uf8fe\n1 + L2 \u2212 \u03c7 L\n(13)\nq\n\nwhere 1/2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 in (2) has been replaced by the factor 2gY2 M N /(2\u03c0R02 )\ncoming from the flat metric (6).\nHowever the analytic structure of the euclidean area (12) involves\ncuts in the complex T , \u03b8 planes and thus leads to an ambiguity coming\nfrom the branch cut of the logarithm. In fact when performing the\nanalytical continuation we have to specify the Riemann sheet of the\nlogarithm (i.e. log \u2192 log + 2\u03c0in). This leads to an additional real\nmultiplicative factor in (2):\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1 q\n\uf8f2\n2gY2 M N L2 \uf8fd\n,\n(14)\nexp \u2212n\n\uf8f3\n\u03c7\n2R02 \uf8fe\n\nwith these boundaries the helicoid may be an unstable [23] minimum for a too large value\nof the cut-off. We will not consider this problem in the present paper.\n\n10\n\n\fthe form of which is uniquely fixed by the euclidean expression (12)\nup to a choice of the integer n. Within the classical approximation\nwhich we have been using it is not possible to determine the value\nof n. On a more physical ground, in section 4, we will relate the\nanalogue of the label n which appears in the calculation of Wilson loop\ncorrelators with multivalued saddlepoint minima of a minimization\nequation and thus to different classical solutions. The determination\nof the relative weights of the various contributions goes beyond the\nclassical approximation used throughout this paper5 .\nAs can be seen the contribution (14) is cut-off independent.\nAnother useful way of deriving the above factor (14) can be directly obtained from the integral leading to (12). This method can be\ngeneralized to more complicated background geometries, for instance\nto the conformal case, which we will consider later, for which we lack\nan exact expression of the form (12).\nLet us perform only the first part of the analytical continuation (4)\n\u03b8 \u2212\u2192 \u2212i\u03c7 but otherwise remain with the time variable T in Euclidean\nspace. This procedure yields the expression:\nZ L r\nZ L\n\u03c7\n\u03c4 2 \u03c72\n\u03c0L2\n.\n(15)\nd\u03c3 1 \u2212 2 =\nd\u03c4\nL\n2\u03c7\n0\n\u2212L\n\u03c7\n\nWe see that the imaginary part may be obtained by integrating (n\ntimes) around the branch cut of the square root. A convenient reinterpretation of the aboveq\nformula follows from performing the change\nof variables \u03c3 \u2212\u2192 \u03c3 \u2032 = \u03c3\n2in\n\nZ\n\n+L\n\u03c7\n\u2212L\n\u03c7\n\n1\u2212\n\nd\u03c4\n\nZ\n\n\u03c4 2 \u03c72\n.\nL2\n\nq\n\n1\u2212 \u03c4\n\nThen we get\n\n2 \u03c72\nL\nL2\n\n0\n\nd\u03c3 \u2032 = ni\u03c0\n\nL2\n\u03c7\n\n(16)\n\nwhich is effectively twice (\u00d7in) the area of a minimal surface bounded\nby a 'half-elipse' of radii L and L/\u03c7. This T -independent imaginary\npart is unaffected by the second part of the analytical continuation\n(4), and leads directly to the factor (14).\n5\n\nWe also note the close similarity of the n, L and \u03c7 dependence in (14) with an analogous factor exp(\u2212nL2 /\u03c0\u03c7) in the imaginary part of the D brane scattering amplitude [24]\nwhere n labels the poles of the appropriate string partition function between the branes.\n\n11\n\n\fReggeization in quark-(anti)quark scattering\nOur result for the Wilson line correlation function for the AdS BH\ngeometry gives rise to the following contributions\nq\n\uf8f1q\n\uf8ee r\n\uf8f9\uf8fc\nT 2 \u03c72\nT \uf8fd\n\uf8f2 2gY2 M N\n2\n2\n2\n+\u03c7\n1\n+\n2\nT \u03c7\nL\nL\nL\n\uf8fb\nA \u0303n = exp\ni \uf8f0LT 1+ 2 +\nlog q\n\uf8f3 2\u03c0R02\n\uf8fe\nL\n2\u03c7\nT 2 \u03c72\nT\n1+ L2 \u2212\u03c7 L\n\uf8f1 q\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f2\n2gY2 M N L2 \uf8fd\n\u00d7 exp \u2212n\n.\n(17)\n\uf8f3\n\u03c7\n2R02 \uf8fe\n\nThere is a divergent phase in the above amplitude when the temporal\nlength of the lines T goes to infinity. We interpret this divergence\nas reflecting the expected IR divergence of the q \u2212 q\u0304 scattering amplitude [7, 8]. A consistent way to eliminate this cut-off dependence\nis to consider an IR finite physical quantity like scattering of two q q\u0304\npairs (see section 4). In the present case of Wilson lines, the specific\nfactorized form of (17) allows for a determination of an IR finite contribution, which can be interpreted as an effect of inelastic channels\non the Wilson line correlator.\nIt is known since a very long time that the superposition of long\nrange and short range potentials in the Schroedinger equation leads\nto a factorization formula for the relevant S matrix elements for each\npartial wave [25]. For instance in nuclear physics, the superposition\nof long range coulombic and short range interactions leads to a factorization into the elastic coulombic S matrix element and a short range\namplitude modified by the long-range background. The elastic S matrix may be treated as a redefinition of the asymptotic initial and final\nstates. The amplitude reads\nA(l, s) = e2i\u03b4(l,s) * T (l, s)\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u03b4 is the real phase shift due to the elastic long range interactions\nand T is the short range part of the amplitude. For instance in the\nQED result for electron scattering [26], the real phase shift exhibits a\ndivergence which can be written as\n\u0012 2 \u0013\u001b\n\u001a 2\nL\ne\n2i\u03b4(l,s)\n,\n(19)\ne\n\u221d exp i coth \u03c7 log\n4\u03c0\n4T 2\nwhere 1/T has been substituted for a fictitious photon mass (IR regulator).\n\n12\n\n\fIn hadronic interaction physics [27], a similar factorization appears\nfor the S matrix elements for 2-body channels in terms of an elastic\ncontribution and an amplitude T (l, s) which, by unitarity of the S\nmatrix, arises from the contribution of many inelastic channels to the\n2-body S matrix [28]. In this context the amplitude (18) can be related\nto the inelasticity (overlap matrix) in the scattering namely\np\n1 \u2212 1 \u2212 2f (l, s)\nT (l, s) =\n(20)\n2\nwhere the overlap matrix elements f (l, s) are defined from the 2-body\nS matrix contribution to unitarity |S(l, s)|2 \u2261 1 \u2212 2f (l, s).\nWe are led to interpret our resulting amplitude (17) in the same\nway. The factor (13) can be treated as redefining the initial and final\nq q\u0304 states due to long range interactions6 . Naturally this phase is IR\ndivergent. The analogous inelastic contribution Tn (l, s) is obtained\nto be the cut-off independent factors (14). Note that this physical\ninterpretation requires the integer n to be positive. We will return to\nthe discussion of the n dependence in a further section.\nLet us discuss both factors of the amplitude (17). The contribution\nof the real phase shifts behaves in the large T limit like\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1q\n\u0012 \u221a\n\u0013\u0013\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f2 2gY2 M N \u0012\n2\nL\n2 e\u03c7T\n2\n2\ni T \u03c7+\nlog\n+ O(1/T )\n(21)\nexp\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f3 2\u03c0R02\n\u03c7\nL\n\n6\n\nThe appearance of the IR divergent T 2 and L2 log T terms in the phase\nshift can be linked with the linear confining potential of the theory.\nThe effect of the confining potential is expected to generate inelastic channels through the phenomenon of string breaking and/or\nclosed string emission. Within the above framework, where we select\ninitial and final q q\u0304 states, this contribution is expected to appear as an\ninelastic real factor in the amplitude, while the phase factor diverges\nwith T \u2212\u2192 \u221e.\nThe inelastic q q\u0304 interaction amplitude at level n is\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1 q\n\uf8f2\n2gY2 M N L2 \uf8fd\n(22)\nTn (l, s) = exp \u2212n\n\uf8f3\n\u03c7\n2R02 \uf8fe\n\nIt is clear that there remains a freedom in attributing a finite real phase shift either\nto the redefinition of the states or to the interaction. Here we adopt the convention that\nT (l, s) is purely real and thus contains information only on the inelasticity.\n\n13\n\n\fwhere the initial and final states are both q q\u0304. It can be easily fourier\ntransformed into transverse momentum space giving\n2\n\nR\nt\n1+ \u221a 0\niR02 ln s\n2n\n2g 2\nN\nYM\nTn (s, t) = q\n.\ns\nn 2gY2 M N\n\n(23)\n\nThis contribution is thus reggeized with a linear Regge trajectory with\nunit intercept and the slope given by the string tension related to the\nhorizon distance R02 .\nIt is worthwhile to consider what changes in the preceeding discussion if we go from q-q\u0304 scattering to q-q scattering. In geometric terms,\nthis corresponds to changing the orientation of one of the lines, and\nsince the string worldsheet spanned on the Wilson lines is oriented,\nthe twisting angle of the helicoid changes as\n\u03b8 \u2212\u2192 \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c0\n\n(24)\n\nUpon analytical continuation this means that \u03c7 \u223c log s changes to\n\u03c7 \u2212 i\u03c0 \u223c log se\u2212i\u03c0 , as required by crossing properties, which are seen\nto have here a very simple geometric interpretation. We note that in\nthe asymptotically high energy limit log s \u226b 1, one obtains the same\nfactors (17) for both qq and q q\u0304 channels. Keeping the next to leading\ncorrection corresponding to log s \u2212\u2192 log se\u2212i\u03c0 preserves the crossing\nrelations between those channels.\nFinally let us compare our result with the general structure of\nWilson line correlators at weak gauge coupling. Indeed, the large T\ndependence of the q q\u0304 amplitudes we discuss reflects IR divergences\nwhich appear already in perturbative (weak coupling) calculations of\nthe same quantities.\nFor instance in the case of QED the whole dynamics is contained\nin the infinite phase factor (19) and the divergence is logarithmic.\nThe (renormalon improved) 1-loop QCD result [8, 29] for q q\u0304 scattering is\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u001b\n\u001a\nT\n\u03c1 2 L2\n1 \u03b1s\nlog\n\u2212 \u039b\n(25)\nexp \u2212\n\u03c7 \u03c0\nL\n\u03c0\n\u03c7\n\nwhere \u03c1 is an undetermined nonperturbative parameter. We note the\ncompatibility between the nonperturbative cut-off independent piece\nin (25) and an analogous term in our result (22). Our nonperturbative\nresult gives a hint on the scale and coupling dependence.\nIf the intercept one common to all contributions Tn (s, t) (see formula (23)) is not spoiled by the different weights corresponding to\n\n14\n\n\ffluctuations of the worldsheet around classical solutions, it would be\na candidate for the intercept one trajectories (the so-called pomeron\nand odderon) which are expected to emerge from a confining strongly\ninteracting gauge theory.\n\n3\n\nConformal case\n\nThe flat metric approximation which we have used to derive the resulting area (12) assumed that the impact parameter L is sufficiently\nlarge with respect to the scale set by the horizon radius R0 (or a similar scale in the backgrounds [19, 20] interpolating between a confining\ngeometry at large z and approximately AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 near the boundary\nz = 0). In this regime the dominant contribution to the amplitudes\ncame from the part of the string worldsheet stretched near the horizon.\nIf we go to smaller impact parameters L < R0 (and also for T <\nR0 ), the minimal surface would only penetrate into a limited region\nnear the boundary z = 0, see Figure 2. In the scenarios which behave\nbetter at short distances than the original BH proposal, the metric\nbecomes closer and closer to the conformal AdS5 case. We note that\nthe AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 setting is directly related to scattering in the N = 4\nSYM. This different geometry leads to a qualitatively new behaviour\nwhich we now analyze.\n\nThe conformal AdS5 case\nIn the case of N = 4 SYM corresponding to the AdS5 \u00d7S 5 background\nwe do not know yet the exact generalization of the helicoid, and some\napproximation scheme is needed. As in the previous case, we will\nconcentrate on extracting the inelastic contribution which appears also\nhere to be independent of the IR temporal cut-off T . We use the\nmethod outlined in section 2 leading to formulae (15)-(16).\nWithin a variational approximation approach, we will look for\na minimal solution in a restricted set of surfaces (\"generalized helicoids\") parameterized by\n\u03b8\u03c3\nL\n\u03b8\u03c3\ny = \u03c4 sin\nL\nx = \u03c3\nt = \u03c4 cos\n\n15\n\n(26)\n(27)\n(28)\n\n\fz = z(\u03c3, \u03c4 ) .\n\n(29)\n\nEvaluation of the induced metric gives rise to the following area functional:\ns\u0012\n\u0013\nZ L\nZ T\n1\n\u03c4 2 \u03b82\nd\u03c3 2\nd\u03c4\n(30)\n1 + 2 (1 + z\u03c42 ) + z\u03c32 .\nz\nL\n0\n\u2212T\nq\n2 2\n\u2032\nWe perform a change of variables \u03c3 \u2212\u2192 \u03c3 = \u03c3 1 + \u03c4L\u03b82 which yields\n1\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\n\nZ\n\nT\n\nd\u03c4\n\u2212T\n\nZ\n\nL\n\nq\n\n1+ \u03c4\n\n2 \u03b82\nL2\n\n0\n\nd\u03c3 \u2032\n\n1\nz2\n\nq\n\n1 + z\u03c42 + z\u03c32 \u2032 .\n\n(31)\n\nAs in the previous section the cut-off independent part is obtained\nfrom the branch cut structure of the area functional (31). The analytic continuation \u03b8 \u2212\u2192 \u2212i\u03c7 changes the boundary conditions for\nthe minimal surface to be a half elipse of width L/\u03c7\np and height L\n(the upper integration limit in (31) then becomes L 1 \u2212 \u03c4 2 \u03c72 /L2 ).\nDue to conformal invariance we know that the minimal area has the\nfollowing form:\nAminimal = f (L/\u01eb, \u03c7) + g(\u03c7)\n(32)\nwhere \u01eb is the \"5th \" AdS coordinate where we put the D3 brane probe.\n\u01eb translates directly into the mass of the W bosons which play here\nthe role of quarks. We do not expect higher poles in \u01eb than first order,\nwhich are in the standard way subtracted out [10, 30], so we have at\nmost a logarithmic behaviour in L/\u01eb.\nIt is possible to obtain an approximate result in the high energy\n\u03c7 \u2212\u2192 \u221e limit from known properties of Wilson loop expectation values\n[10, 30]. The half-elipse has two cusps each with an angle \u03c0/2, whose\ncontribution to Aminimal can be obtained from the results of [30]. This\nleads to the following logarithmic terms:\n\u22122\n\nL\n1\nF (\u03c0/2) * log\n2\u03c0\n\u01eb\u03c7\n\n(33)\n\nwhere F (\u03a9) is a complicated function calculated in [30] (F (\u03c0/2) \u223c\n0.3\u03c0). The \u01eb independent term g(\u03c7) in (32) can be approximated by\nnoting that at high energies the half-elipse is very much elongated\nand looks like parallel lines of length L, roughly 2L/\u03c7 apart.

In all\ncases we obtain a factorized energy behaviour with no moving Regge\ntrajectories. We note that for n positive a similar energy dependence\n(i.e. with intercept greater than 1 and a (nearly) flat Regge trajectory)\nis obtained by resumming the leading log s terms in the perturbative\nexpansion at weak coupling [31] for the singlet exchange amplitude. In\nthe conformal case, there remains a non-perturbative screening effect\n(already present for\nq the static q q\u0304 potential [10]) which appears as the\n\nchange gY2 M N \u2192 gY2 M N in the exponent of s.\nConsidering the impact parameter dependence and its Fourier transform to momentum space, in the window of convergence (the exponent\nof L in (35) between \u22122 and \u22123/2), we get\n\u221a 2\n\u221a 2\n2g\nN\nF (\u03c0/2)\nYM\n2g\nN \u0012 \u00131+n\n4\nYM\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n1\n1+n 2\u03c0 4 *\n2\u03c0\n\u0393(1/4)\nTn (s, t) \u223c is\n(36)\nt\n\nOtherwise one observes either an UV divergence (for exponent values\nless than \u22122) or an IR one (for values larger than \u22123/2). For positive\nvalues of n the IR divergence requires a careful treatment which is\nbeyond the scope of this paper. Note that, in the case of N = 4 SYM,\nit can lead to infra-red divergent pieces also in the inelastic amplitude,\nas is the case already in the perturbative limit [8, 32].\n\nConformal/non-conformal transition\nAs already mentioned, the result (36) obtained for the pure AdS5 \u00d7 S 5\ncase should give the dominant behaviour also for the confining theory for impact parameters small with respect to the horizon scale7\nR0 (or more generally an analogous transition scale in the geometries\n[19, 20]). Indeed this R0 provides a natural value of the impact parameter cut-off L0 . Thus even in the confining theory, when the impact\n7\n\nWe need also a sufficiently small T parameter.\n\n17\n\n\fparameter is decreased and gets smaller than R0 , we expect a transition from the set of components (22) to the results (35), as long as\nthe relevant geometry for small z is similar to AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 .\nThis process can be observed by noting that both (22) and (35)\nwere derived from a minimal surface spanned on a semielipse. The\nresult for impact parameters L \u2265 O(R0 ) was obtained by using the\narea law for Wilson loops, while the conformal case (corresponding\nhere to L \u226a R0 ) used an approximation using coulombic potential.\nThe solution of the appropriate minimal surface problem in the full\ngeometry would lead to an interpolation between the two extreme\ncases.\n\n4 Wilson loop correlators and scattering amplitudes\nWe saw that an inherent feature of the q-q\u0304 scattering amplitude is its\nIR divergence. In order to remedy this, and also to show a context\nwhere the finite behaviour of the inelastic amplitudes calculated in\nthe previous section appears directly without the infinite phases, we\nare led to consider the scattering of two q q\u0304 pairs of transverse size a,\nand impact parameter distance L. This process is interesting to study\nin itself, since it gives some information on the scattering amplitudes\nbetween colourless states in gauge theories at strong coupling.\nFor this setup we have to calculate the correlation function of two\nWilson loops [9], where the loops are choosen to be elongated along\nthe \"time\" direction and have a large but arbitrary temporal length T\n(the exact analogue for Wilson loops of T considered in the previous\nsection). However, the cut-off dependence on T is expected to be\nremoved together with the related IR divergence which was present\nfor the case of Wilson lines.\nFor large positive and negative times the minimal surface will be\nwell approximated by two seperate copies of the standard minimal\nsurfaces for each loop separately. When we come to the interaction\nregion, and for L sufficiently small, one can lower the area by forming\na \"tube\" joining the two worldsheets. Since we want to calculate\nthe normalized correlator hW1 W2 i / hW1 i hW2 i, the contributions of\nthe regions outside the tube will cancel out (in a first approximation\nneglecting deformations near the tube). Therefore we have just to\nfind the area of the tube, and subtract from it the area of the two\n\n18\n\n\findependent worldsheets. It is at this stage that we see that the result\ndoes not depend on the maximal length of the Wilson loops T , and\nhence is IR finite. The whole contribution to the amplitude will just\ncome from the area of the tube.\nSince we cannot obtain an exact minimal surface for these boundary conditions, let us perform a variational approximation. Namely\nwe will consider a family of surfaces forming the tube, parameterized\nby Ttube , which has the interpretation of an \"effective\" time of interaction. Then we will make a saddle point minimization of the area as\na function of this parameter.\nSuppose that the tube linking the two Wilson lines is formed in the\nregion of the time parameter t \u2208 (\u2212Ttube , Ttube ). In our approximation\nits two \"sides\" are formed by sheets of the helicoid solution (of area\nS(Ttube ), see (12) for the euclidean case and (13) for the minkowskian\none).\nq The front and back will be each approximated by strips of area\nT2\n\n\u03b82\n\n(we assume a, L \u2265 R0 ).\naL 1 + tube\nL2\nThe total area corresponding to the two Wilson loops is then given\nby\ns\nZ Ttube r\nT 2 \u03b82\n\u03c4 2\u03b82\nArea(Ttube ) = 2L\nd\u03c4 1 + 2 +2aL 1 + tube2 \u22124a*Ttube ,\nL\nL\n\u2212Ttube\n(37)\nwhere \u22122aTtube is the contribution of each individual Wilson loop to\nthe normalization 1/ hW1 i hW2 i of the Wilson loop correlation function.\nAnalytically continuing the area formula (37) to the Minkowskian\ncase and using a convenient change of variables, the Minkowskian area\ncan be put in the following simple form\n\u001b\n\u001a\nsin 2\u03c6\n2L2\n+ \u03c1\u03c7 cos \u03c6 \u2212 2\u03c1 sin \u03c6 ,\n(38)\n\u03c6+\nArea(Ttube ) =\n\u03c7\n2\nwhere \u03c1 \u2261 a/L and sin \u03c6 = i\u03c7 Ttube /L is the new variational parameter.\nq\nIn the strong coupling limit (\u03b1\u2032 = 1/ 2gY2 M N \u2192 0) the parameter\n\u03c6 is dynamically determined from the saddle point equation:\n0=\n\n\u03c1\u03c7\n\u2202Area(\u03c6)\n= cos \u03c6(cos \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c1) \u2212\nsin \u03c6\n\u2202\u03c6\n2\n\n(39)\n\nIt is easy to realize that for large enough energy, there exists a solution\n\n19\n\n\fwith \u03c6 \u223c \u00b1n\u03c0. Inserting this solution into the area (38) we find\nArea(\u03c6) = \u2212\n\n2L2\nn\u03c0 + 2aL(\u22121)n\n\u03c7\n\n(40)\n\nwhere we retain the physical solutions with n positive integer. We\nthus find a set of solutions very similar to the inelastic factor obtained\nin section 2. The modification due to the front-back contribution\n2aL is negligible\nin the Fourier transformed amplitude for momentum\n\u221a\ntransfer \u2212t \u226b a/R02 . Also this term is probably more dependent on\nthe treatment of the front-back parts of the tube in our approximation.\nIt is interesting to note that the minimization (39) gives rise in\na natural way to a similar set of solutions parameterized by integers\nas found from the branch cut arguments in section 2. Each value\nof n corresponds to a saddle point i.e. a classical solution. The determination of the weights of each component to the total scattering\namplitude is beyond the reach of the classical approximation.\nFor completeness, let us briefly discuss the general saddle point\nsolution. For lower energies, there are families of solutions also leading\nto reggeized behaviour but with distorted trajectories. For \u03c7 small\nthere exist solutions with \u03c6 imaginary and thus leading to elastic parts\nof the amplitude. The study of these solutions is beyond the scope\nof the present paper. For too large impact parameters we may enter\nthe purely elastic regime found in [5] which does not correspond to\nconnected minimal surfaces (the Gross-Ooguri transition [14]).\nAs a word of caution (and incentive for further study) we note\nthat the saddle point in terms of Ttube is mainly driven to complex\nvalues. This indicates that a complete treatment and an investigation\nof the Gross-Ooguri transition requires a more refined study of the\ntube minimal surface.\nLet us analyze the properties of the resulting amplitude. Recalling\nthat charge conjugation acting on one of the q q\u0304 pairs is equivalent to\nconsidering the transformation \u03c7 \u2192 \u03c7 \u2212 i\u03c0, it is convenient to analyze the components of definite signature [3] with the even and odd\ncontributions given by\n\u221a 2\n\u221a 2\n\u2212n\n\nT\u0303n\u00b1 (l, s) = e\n\n2g\nN 2\nL\nYM\n\u03c7\nR2\n0\n\n\u2212n\n\n\u00b1 e\n\n2g\nN 2\nL\nYM\n\u03c7\u2212i\u03c0\nR2\n0\n\n.\n\n(41)\n\nNote the relative factor of 2 in the exponent in comparison with (22)\ndue to the two sheet structure of the minimal surface.\n\n20\n\n\fUsing the Fourier transform (1) we finally get\nTn\u00b1 (s, t) =\nwhere\n\niR2 ln s\niR02 ln(\u2212s)\nq0\ns\u03b1n (t) \u2213 q\n(\u2212s)\u03b1n (t) ,\n2\n2\n2n 2gY M N\n2n 2gY M N\nR02\n\n\u03b1n (t) = 1 +\n4n\n\nq\n\n2gY2 M N\n\nt.\n\n(42)\n\n(43)\n\nLet us consider the contribution with n = 1 which is dominant at\nlarge L. It is easy to realize that the amplitude (42) corresponds to\nspecific Regge singularities in the S-matrix framework, namely double\nRegge poles whose trajectory is given by \u03b11 (t). Indeed, using the usual\nR sj dj\n, it can be written in the following\nMellin transform s\u03b1 \u2261 2i\u03c0(j\u2212\u03b1)\nequivalent forms:\no\niR2\n\u2202 n \u03b11 (t)\nq 0\n(44)\ns\n\u2213 (\u2212s)\u03b11 (t)\n2 2gY2 M N \u2202\u03b1\n\uf8f1\n\u0010 \u0011\uf8fc\nZ\n\u03c0j \uf8fd\n\uf8f2\n\u2212i\u03c0j/2\nj\n2\ni\nsin\ndj e\ns\nR0\n2\u0011\n\u0010\nq\n,\n=\n2 \uf8f3\n\u03c0j\n\uf8fe\n\u03c0\n(j\n\u2212\n\u03b1\n(t))\n1\ncos\n2 2g 2 N C\n\nT1\u00b1 (s, t) =\n\n2\n\nYM\n\nwhere the complex contour C can be taken around the Regge (di)pole\ntrajectory \u03b11 (t) and the signature factors are either sin \u03c0j/2 or\n\u2212i cos \u03c0j/2 depending on the positive or negative signature.\nLet us discuss the contributions Tn to the amplitude with n > 1.\nIn the absence of a direct determination of their relative weights, it\nis interesting to note that unitarization of Regge amplitudes in the\nS matrix framework [28, 27] leads to a similar decomposition where\nthe Tn correspond to Regge pole/cut singularities. In particular, the\noverlap matrix formalism [28], see (20), leads to a specific model for\nthe relative weights\nof the Tn 's,\u0013if we assume a gaussian distribution\n\u0012 \u221a\n\nf (l, s) \u223c f0 exp \u2212\n\n2\n2\n2gY\nMN L\n\u03c7\n2R20\n\nfor the inelasticity. In this frame-\n\nwork [28] unitarity is fulfilled whenever 0 < f0 < 1/2. However the\nderivation of the Wilson line/loop correlation function does not allow\nus to give model-independent predictions for these weights in the total\namplitude.\nFinally let us comment on the relation of our results on the trajectory \u03b1(t) with the glueball spectrum calculations [33]. An extrap-\n\n21\n\n\folation of the trajectory (43) to positive t leads to masses of the form\nq\n2gY2 M N\n2\nM = 4n(J \u2212 1)\n(45)\nR02\nwhere J is the spin and n labels the different trajectories. Because\nof the appearance of coupling constant dependence it is easy to see\nthat these states correspond to massive string states and not to supergravity fields associated with the glueballs found in [33]. Indeed the\nlatter states have masses proportional just to 1/R02 and spin limited\nby J \u2264 2. The appearence of massive string states is not surprising in\nour case as we consider an extended string worldsheet between the two\nWilson loops instead of a supergravity field exchange. The transition\nbetween both situations and thus the relation between both sets of\nstates remains an open problem.\nWe should note that our approximations for calculating the Wilson\nloop correlator (which is the channel relevant for glueballs) are rather\ncrude and become problematic at small t (consider the discussion after (40)). Therefore the extrapolation of the linear trajectory into the\nglueball regime can easily break down. Unfortunately the complexity of the minimal surface problem with the Wilson loop boundary\nconditions does not allow us to make more quantitative estimates.\n\n5\n\nConclusions and outlook\n\nLet us give our main conclusions. By computing Wilson line and\nWilson loop correlation functions in the framework of the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence we show a relation between minimal surface problems\nin AdS5 metrics and reggeization in gauge field theory at strong coupling.\nFor Wilson line correlators, we isolate in certain cases IR finite\ninelastic amplitudes coming from the branch cut structure of the analytical continuation of helicoid-like surfaces i.e. minimal surfaces with\nstraight line boundary conditions corresponding to classical trajectories in Minkowski space.\nWe considered three cases: (i) flat metric approximation of an\nAdS black hole metric giving rise to Regge amplitudes with linear\ntrajectories, (ii) an approximate evaluation for the conformal AdS5 \u00d7\n\n22\n\n\fS 5 geometry leading to flat Regge trajectories8 and (iii) evidence for\na transition, in a confining theory, from behaviour of type (i) to (ii)\nwhen the impact parameter decreases below the interpolation scale set\nby the horizon radius. In this case, confinement provides a natural IR\ncut-off scale.\nIn a second stage we considered the correlation function of two\nWilson loops elongated along the light cone directions for the confining geometry. This configuration corresponds to a high energy scattering amplitude between colourless q q\u0304 states. We use a variational\napproximation where the minimal surface is constructed from two helicoidal sheets. As expected, the obtained amplitude is free from IR\ndivergences and gives rise to reggeization with a linear trajectory with\nunit intercept. For high energies the amplitude is imaginary and thus\nmainly reflects the inelasticity of the process.\nThese results call for some comments.\nWe note that the structure of our resulting amplitudes for the\nconfining case (in particular the n, \u03c7 and L dependence) matches the\ncalculations of the imaginary part of flat space D-brane scattering amplitudes [24] and some specific\nWilson loop correlators9 [34], when the\n\u221a\n\"effective\" string length \u03b1\u2032 is taken to be set by the horizon radius in\nour case. It is interesting to note that the imaginary part in those calculations is generated from the singularities of the string amplitudes\nwhich are an infinite set of poles. The slopes of the trajectories are the\nsame as in our case (43), while the intercepts are different. However\nthe geometrical configurations in [34] is quite different from the one we\nconsidered in section 4. Even in the flat space approximation it would\nbe useful to have a direct string calculation of the tube configuration.\nBeyond the flat space approximation, we want to emphasize the\ninterest of solving exactly the well defined mathematical problem of\nfinding the generalization of the helicoid for various AdS metrics, i.e.\nthe minimal surface spanned between infinite lines forming an angle \u03b8\nat the boundary. Another goal is to go beyond the classical approximation in order to derive the n-dependent weights to the scattering\namplitudes.\nIndeed the generalization of the helicoidal geometry in AdS space\nseems to be a building block for high energy scattering amplitudes in\n8\n\nA remaining IR divergence in the inelastic amplitude is still present in the absence of\nconfinement.\n9\nWe have extracted the imaginary part from the formulae in Ref. [34], along the lines\nof [24].\n\n23\n\n\fgauge theories at strong coupling.\n\nAcknowledgements\nRJ was partially supported by KBN grants 2P03B00814, 2P03B08614.\nWe thank T. Garel and B.
