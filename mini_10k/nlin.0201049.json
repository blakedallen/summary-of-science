Introduction\n\nprobability density function (pdf) of these systems for\nlarge deviations takes the form of an exponential or\nLaplacian distribution. Large errors are much more\nprobable with the exponential and Laplacian distributions than with the Gaussian.\nTherefore, it is possible that there are nonlinear components of the analytical error of some analytical systems, contributing substantially to the total error. Consequently, we may assume that the error of some analytical systems may be approximated by the sum of a\nlinear component of error with Gaussian distribution\nand a nonlinear component with Laplacian distribution.\nAssuming that these components have means equal to\nzero, and are statistically independent, then the pdf\nf(z,l) of the total error of these analytical systems is\napproximated by the convolution integral of the Gaussian pdf with standard deviation sg, and the Laplacian\npdf, with a scale parameter l * sg, where l is a weighting factor :\n\nf ( z, l ) =\n\n3\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n2\n\nz\u2212 x\n\n\u2212\n1\n2 ls g\ne\ndx\n2 ls g\n\nThe variance and the mean of the distribution are respectively:\nVar(l)= sg2 +2 l2 sg2\n\u03bc(l)=0\nThe maximum likelihood function ml(l) given a series\nof n measurements xi with the proposed pdf f(x i,l), a\nweighting factor l, and a standard deviation s, is:\nn\n\nml (l ) = \u2211 Log ( f ( x i , l )) =\ni =1\n\nn\n\n\u2211 Log( \u222b\ni =1\n\nIn clinical chemistry, it is usually assumed that the distribution of the analytical error is normal or Gaussian.\nTherefore, very large analytical errors are considered\nvery improbable. This assumption of the normality of\nthe analytical error is implied by the successful application of the linearization to the analytical systems.\nAccordingly, the analytical error may be represented as\nthe sum of many small contributions none of which\ncontributes very much to the total error.\nA number of studies show that the probability of very\nlarge analytical errors is much greater than expected.\nWitte et al. have shown that the average probability of\nerrors greater than seven standard devi ations (SD)\nequals 4.47 \u22c510\u20134 13. This probability is 1.7 \u22c5108 times\ngreater than it is expected from the Gaussian distribution.\nIn a brief outline of the emerging field of the statistics\nof complexity, Goldenfeld and Kadanoff have pointed\nout that the behavior of nonlinear complex systems is\nrarely normal 3.

As critical errors are considered the maximum\nallowable random and systematic analytical errors,\n\"defined in such a way that an upper bound has been\nset on the (clinical) type I error\" 7. The clinical type I\nerror is the probability for rejection of the true hypothesis that there is no significant change of the analyte of a patient. The hypothesis is rejected when the\nobserved change of the analyte is greater than the\nmaximum medically allowable analytical error 5.\n\n\f2. Methods\nThe proposed pdf and the respective cumulative distribution function (cdf) were evaluated using numerical\nmethods. The critical errors were calculated as previously described 4, assuming that the upper bound of the\nprobability of a type I clinical error was equal to 0.01.\nThe probabilities for error detection and for false rejection were calculated with numerical methods, assuming\none control measurement per run, and that the control\nmeasurements were independent and identically distributed.\nAs quality control rules S(y) are defined these that reject an analytical run if the absolute value of the difference of at least one control measurement from the expected mean exceeds y standard deviations (SD).\nThe normality hypothesis was tested using the measures of skewness and kurtosis, on the significance level\nof 0.01 2. The probabilities for rejection of this hypothesis were estimated using 10,000 simulated series\nof 100 or 1000 measurements respectively, with the\nproposed distribution.\nThe numerical computations, the simulations, and the\nplots were done with Mathematica\uf8e8 , Version 4.1 14\n(Wolfram Research, Champaign, Illinois, USA).\n\nFigure 2: Logarithmic plots of the Gaussian, the proposed, and the Laplacian pdfs\n\n3.

Discussion\nAnalytical chemistry is usually nonlinear as chemical\nreactions with strictly first-order kinetics are rare 10, 12.\nIn addition, the analytical systems in clinical chemistry\n\n7\n\n\fare becoming increasingly complex, as it is demo nstrated by the development of the ultra sensitive assays.\nAs Goldenfeld and Kadanoff have pointed out, improbable events are much more likely with complex\nnonlinear systems 3. Their probability can often be approximated by an asymptotically exponential 11 or\nLaplacian distribution.\nThe exponential distribution is quite common in physics and physical chemistry. In addition, assuming that x\nis a random variable distributed exponentially and h>0,\nthen the ratio between the probabilities P(h)/P(x>h) is\nindependent of h. Consequently, it is scale invariant.\nScale invariance is often met in complex nonlinear\nsystems 1 and it is a basic concept of the fractal geometry 8.\nHowever, analytical systems can be approximated by\nlinear models that imply a Gaussian distribution of the\nanalytical error. Nevertheless, linear models fail to explain the experimental finding that in clinical chemistry\nvery large errors are much more probable than it is\nexpected with the Gaussian distribution 13.\nAlthough, some of the large errors are assignable-cause\nerrors, I suggest that there is a nonlinear component of\nerror that is inherent in the analytical processes. In addition I propose that the error of some analytical systems may be approximated by the sum of a linear component of error with Gaussian distribution and a\nnonlinear component with Laplacian distribution. Consequently, some measurements that are considered as\noutliers assuming the Gaussian distribution are probable with the proposed distribution.\nThe estimated probabilities for rejection of the normality hypothesis of simulated series of measurements\nwith the proposed distribution and l<0.7, are approximately equal to the respective probabilities of the\nGaussian series of me asurements (Figure 5), although\nthe probabilities for errors >7SD are up to six orders of\nmagnitude greater than the respective ones of the\nGaussian distribution (Table 1). Accordingly, small\nseries of measurements with the proposed distribution\ncould be considered as Gaussian, using some tests of\nnormality.\nAssuming the proposed distribution, the critical random and systematic errors can be significantly less\nthan the respective ones of the Gaussian distribution\n(Figures 6-7). In addition, the probabilities for critical\nrandom and systematic error detection are significantly\nless (Figures 8-9). The probabilities for false rejection\nare greater than the respective probabilities with the\nGaussian distribution (Figures 10-11). The probabilities for error detection differ as well (Figures 12-15).\nTherefore, the existence of a nonlinear component of\nerror affects significantly QC. To improve the QC\nplanning process 15 we should explore the existence of\na nonlinear compo nent of error, including the so-called\n\"outliers\" in the series of the analytical measurements.\nThe maximum likelihood function can be used to estimate the parameter l of very large series of measurements xi with the proposed distribution f(xi,l), but further research is needed:\n\n8\n\na) To select useful 12 goodness-of fit-tests for the proposed distribution, possibly based on the empirical\ndistribution functions statistics 9.\nb) To explore alternative probability density functions,\npossibly asymptotically exponential 11, that fit the experimental data.\nc) To explore additional nonlinear components of the\nanalytical error, possibly caused by random multiplicative processes 6.\nd) To optimize the QC planning process assuming a\nnonlinear component of the analytical error, with numerical methods as well as with powerful heuristic\ntools as the genetic algorithms 4, 5.\n\n5. Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the experimentally found probabilities of\nvery large analytical errors imply the existence of a\nnonlinear component of the analytical error that affects\nQC.\n\n6.
