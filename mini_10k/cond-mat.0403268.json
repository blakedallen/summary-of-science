Di Francesco and J.-B. Zuber\nService de Physique Th\u00e9orique de Saclay,\nCEA/DSM/SPhT, URA 2306 du CNRS,\nF-91191 Gif sur Yvette Cedex, France\nThe problem of counting the number of Fully Packed Loop (FPL) configurations with\nfour sets of a, b, c, d nested arches is addressed. It is shown that it may be expressed as\nthe problem of enumeration of tilings of a domain of the triangular lattice with a conic\nsingularity. After reexpression in terms of non-intersecting lines, the Lindstr\u00f6m-GesselViennot theorem leads to a formula as a sum of determinants. This is made quite explicit\nwhen min(a, b, c, d) = 1 or 2. We also find a compact determinant formula which generates\nthe numbers of configurations with b = d.\nAMS Subject Classification (2000): Primary 05A19; Secondary 52C20, 82B20\n\n03/2004\n\n\fGiven a square grid of side n, Fully Packed Loops (FPL) are sets of paths which\nvisit once and only once each of the n2 sites of the grid and exit through every second of\nthe 4n external edges. FPL of a given size fall into connectivity classes, or link patterns,\nof configurations with a definite set of connectivities between their external edges. The\nproblem of enumerating FPL of a given link pattern is a challenging problem for the\ncombinatorialist, related to alternating sign matrices and other problems of current interest\n(see [1,2] for reviews). It is also of relevance in statistical mechanics, as it is related by\nthe Razumov-Stroganov conjecture [3] to the O(1)-loop model of percolation, see [4] for\nreferences.\nThis paper, which is a continuation of [5], is devoted to a study of FPL configurations\nwith four sets of nested arches. We shall assume the reader to have some familiarity with\nthe ideas and techniques developed in [5] for the case of three sets of nested arches. In\nparticular, with the notion that the boundary conditions force a certain number of edges\nto be occupied or empty (\"fixed edges\"), see also [2] for a precursor of this idea and [6] for\na recent application to other types of FPL configurations.\nOur aim is not only to get formulas as explicit as possible for the numbers of these\nFPL configurations, but also \u2013and mainly\u2013 to see to what extent this problem is equivalent\nto the counting of tilings of certain domains of the triangular lattice, or in a dual picture,\nto that of dimer configurations on a certain graph.\n\nd\na\n\nc\n\nb\n\nFig. 1: The link pattern of FPL configurations with four sets of nested arches.\n\nWe shall consider FPL configurations with four sets of a, b, c and d nested arches and\ndenote An (a, b, c, d) their number, n = a + b + c + d being the total number of arches, see\nFig. 1. We recall Wieland's theorem [7], which asserts that An (a, b, c, d) depends only on\nthe orbit of the FPL link pattern under the action of the dihedral group D2n . Contrary\nto the simple case of 3 sets of arches [5], but like in the more complicated case treated in\n[6], we use this theorem to pick a particularly suitable representative of the orbit.\n1\n\n\fA\n\n2(c+d)+1\na\u2212c\u22121\n\nA\nD\n\nD\n\nb\u2212d\u22121\n\n2(c+d)\n\n*\n2(c+d)\n\nC\nC\n\nB\na\u2212c\n\nB\n(i)\n\nb\u2212d\n2(c+d) \u2212 1\n(ii)\n\nFig. 2: The generic situation where a > c, b > d.

From FPL to dimers to non intersecting lines\n1.1. The octagonal domain of unfixed edges\nUsing the reflective and cyclic symmetries of the problem, An (a, b, c, d) = An (a, d, c, b) =\nAn (b, c, d, a), we may always assume that a \u2265 c and b \u2265 d. Let A, B, C, D denote the\ncenters of the sets of nested arches, we assume they are in anticlockwise order. Because\n\n2(a + b) \u2265 n, A and B belong to different sides of the square. Then one uses the same\n\nprocedure as in [2,5] to fix edges in 45o -cones of vertices A, B, C, D: outside these cones the\noccupied edges either form staircases (red edges on Fig.2 (i)), or every second (blue) edge\n\nparallel to the external ones is occupied: we refer the reader to [5] for a discussion of the\nprocedure. The unfixed edges then live either on the sides of rectangular 2 \u00d7 1 tiles, also\n\ncalled dominos, the inner sides of which are occupied, or inside a connected domain made of\nadjacent elementary squares. Because the latter squares appear as defects (\"disclinations\"\nin the language of cristallography) in the tiling reinterpretation of the FPL, we try to\nmake this domain as small as possible. The choice of a Wieland rotation which brings the\ndiagonal lines emanating from A and C and those from B and D almost colinear, see Fig.\n2\n\n\f2 (ii), reduces this defect zone to a single elementary square (indicated by a star in Fig. 2\n(i) and drawn in red in Fig. 2 (ii)). Thus\nProposition 1. If one chooses Wieland's rotation such that the centers of arches are\nas depicted in Fig. 2, every site of the lattice belongs to at least one fixed edge, and\nthe unfixed edges form an octagonal pattern O made of dominos surrounding a single\n\nelementary square.\n\nThe locations of the points A, B, C, D and of the small square are determined by the\ndata given in Fig. 2. We refer to this pattern of unfixed edges as the domino grid O, to\n\nthe sites which belong to a single fixed edge as active, and to the elementary square as the\ncentral square.\nThe figure depicts the generic situation when both differences a \u2212 c and b \u2212 d are\n\ngreater than 0. This includes the cases where one or/and the other equals 1, and where\nthe octagon loses some side(s) and acquires right angles.\nA\n\nD\n\nA\n\nD\n\nC\nB\n(3,2,1,1)\n\nB\n(3,1,1,1)\n\nC\n\nA\n\nD\n\nB\n\nC\n(2,1,2,1)\n\nFig. 3: Limiting cases where a \u2212 c and/or b \u2212 d equals 0 or 1.\n\nIn the case a \u2212 c = 0, b \u2212 d > 0 (or vice versa), the side of length a \u2212 c \u2212 1 shrinks to\n\nnaught, while the adjacent sides are reduced by one unit, hence have lengths 2(c + d) \u2212 1\n\nand 2(c + d). One is left with a hexagonal domain with two right angles, see Fig. 3. If\nboth a = c and b = d, one gets a rectangle.\nGiven this set of fixed edges, an FPL configuration is determined by an appropriate\nchoice of dimers, i.e., of pairings, between the active sites, realizing the desired connectivity\npattern. In particular, there are two special configurations, that we call the \"empty\"\nand the \"full\" ones. These configurations are obtained by dividing the domain O into\n\nsubdomains and choosing the dimers as indicated in Fig. 4.\n\nThus to any FPL configuration corresponds a dimer configuration. This correspondence between the set of FPL configurations of type (a, b, c, d) and the set of dimer configurations on O cannot, however, be one-to-one. Indeed it is clear from our discussion that\nthe domino grid is common to all FPL types (a + p, b \u2212 p, c + p, d \u2212 p) for all p, \u2212c \u2264 p \u2264 d.\n3\n\n\fA\n\nA\nD\n\nD\n\n*\n\n*\n\nC\n\nC\n\nB\n\nB\nempty\n\nfull\n\nFig. 4: The dimers of the empty and the full configurations, for (a, b, c, d) = (9, 14, 4, 5).\nThe broken black lines show how to define the limits of the various domains, while the pink\nones give the limits of the sets of nested arches. The light blue dots will be explained below\nin sect. 1.4.3.\n\nThis is obvious in Fig. 2 where the effect of (a, b, c, d) \u2192 (a \u00b1 1, b \u2213 1, c \u00b1 1, d \u2213 1) is just\n\nto shift the boundaries between the different sets of nested arches (the broken black lines\nin Fig.2 (i)), while preserving the points A, B, C, D, the shape of the octagon, the domino\ngrid and the location of the central square.\nTo distinguish dimer configurations pertaining to different p's, we now introduce a\nnew feature, made of non intersecting lines.\n1.2. Tilings and de Bruijn lines\nAt this stage we find it useful to introduce the dual picture, where one constructs a\ntriangle around each active site. The central square is also triangulated by four triangles.\nOne gets an octagonal picture O\u2032 which is depicted in Fig. 5, in (i) for the simple FPL\n\n(2, 1, 1, 1) and in (ii) for a more generic one.\n\nA final transformation consists in cutting this octagon along a line L starting from the\ncentral square, deforming the grid into a domain D of the regular triangular lattice and\n\nidentifying the two sides L\u00b1 of the cut. Figure 5 (iii) shows one particular way to do this.\nFor future use, we also draw a segment L' which joins the center of the central square to\nthe \"East-North-East\" corner of the octagon. (Note that the segments L and L' do not\ncoincide with the lines used in the construction of Fig. 2, although they are parallel and\n4\n\n\fc+d\na-c\n\nL' a+d-1\n\nb-d\n\nb+c\n\nL'\n\nc+d\nV\n\nc+d\n\nL+\n\nV\nc+d\n\nL-\n\nc+d\n\nc+d\n\nL\na+d\n\nb-d+1\n\nb-d\na-c\nc+d\n\nO'\n\n(i)\n\nD\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\nFig. 5: Triangulating the octagonal grid.

Below, we shall slightly modify them, in a way depending on the tiling at\nhand, so as to prevent them from intersecting the tiles.)\nAny FPL configuration yields a pairing between triangles sharing an edge, hence a\ntiling of the octagon by means of the tiles depicted in Fig. 6. Just as in the previous\nsection, the tilings of the domain D comprise all cases (a + p, b \u2212 p, c + p, d \u2212 p), for p\nrunning from \u2212c to d.\nFor a particular (a, b, c, d), we have to find a refined characterization of the tiling\nconfigurations.

On\nthe right figure, they have been continued across the cut as broken lines.\n\nGiven the tiling associated with a certain FPL configuration of type (a, b, c, d), consider\nthe c + d de Bruijn lines which start from the vertical left side V of the domain O\u2032 of Fig.\n\n5 (ii) or D of Fig. 5 (iii). As noticed above, the tiling is made of strips of tiles, pairwise\n\nsharing edges parallel to a given direction, and the de Bruijn lines join the middles of these\n\nedges: see for example the tilings and these lines for the empty and full configurations in\nFig. 8 and 9. These lines are non-intersecting, and we call c lines the first c starting from\nthe bottom of the left vertical interval V, and d lines, those (in number d) which start\nfrom the upper part of that interval. We continue these lines across the domain until they\n7\n\n\freach the line L or exit through the boundary of O\u2032 , whichever occurs first. In fact, we\n\nclaim (and will prove below) that they all reach the line L first, and more precisely, that\n\nthe c lines will reach it from below, while the d ones will do it from above. On the domain\nD, the c lines reach the lower cut L\u2212 while the d lines reach the upper one L+ . We now\n\nstate the main result of this paper:\n\nTheorem 1. There is a bijection between FPL configurations of type (a, b, c, d) and\nfamilies of c and d non intersecting lines on D, where the c lines go from V to L\u2212 , and\n\nthe d lines go from V to L+ . The sets of points where the c lines and the d lines reach L\nare disjoint.\nThis theorem has been stated for the lines on D but can of course be rephrased on\n\nO\u2032 . Because the endpoints on L of the d lines are disjoint from those of the c, we allow\n\na slight (configuration-dependent) redefinition of the lines L\u00b1 on the domain D so as to\nmake them lie along tile edges, see Fig. 8.\n\nTo prove this theorem, we establish a certain number of properties of the c and d\nlines, going back and forth between the two pictures, on the octagonal grid O on the one\nhand, on the cut domain D one on the other. The properties of the lines are indeed easier\n\nto establish in the tiling version, but to discuss their interplay with the FPL paths, it is\nessential to return to O.\n\nThe first step is thus to translate the construction of the c and d lines back to the\n\noctagonal grid O. By a slight abuse of notation, we still denote them by c, d on O. Note\n\nthat the (active) sites of O are bicolorable. By convention, we assign the color \u2022 to point\nC and to all sites distant from it by an even number of lattice steps, and \u25e6 to the others.\n(For the sake of clarity, only a few sites have been colored in Fig. 10.) When drawn on O,\n\nthe two segments L and L' start from the upper right corner of the central square and pass\nby the external endpoints of the two empty edges entering the FPL grid at the points C\n\nand D, respectively 1 . These lines divide the octagonal domain O into two regions I and\n\nII, see Fig. 10. Note that, by the construction of the subsection 1.1, region II contains all\nthe horizontal fixed edges of the right part of O and segments L and L' pass through their\n\nleftmost endpoints. Now, for a given FPL configuration of type (a, b, c, d), associated with\na certain choice of dimers on the domino grid O, we call vacant the yet unused edges of O.\n1\n\nThis last assertion has to be slightly amended in the case where a = c, b = d and the four\n\npoints A, B, C, D lie at the corners of the octagon, which has degenerated into a square (see Fig.\n3).\n\n8\n\n\fThe c and d lines start from the c + d vacant horizontal external edges bordering the left\nvertical side of the domino grid and are oriented inwards the grid. They visit alternatingly\na vacant edge and a dimer of the FPL configuration, with the rule that the chosen vacant\nedges (called phantom) are all horizontal (and oriented from left to right) in region I and\nvertical (and oriented from top to bottom) in region II. This rule is just the transcription\nof the definition of the c and d lines on D, namely it reflects the pairing of adjacent tiles\nwhich share a vertical edge.\nIn the same way as on D, the first c lines from the bottom are called c lines, the next d\nare called d lines, and we interrupt them as soon as they touch either the segment L or one\nof the boundaries of the grid. Note that the fact that the lines may be constructed without\nencountering any obstruction or that they are non-intersecting, which is not obvious from\nthe standpoint of O, follows from their construction on the domain D as conventional de\nBruijn lines. This is summarized in\nLemma 1. On O, the c and d lines are non intersecting; each of them is described by an\nalternate sequence of dimers and of \"phantom\" edges.\nIn region I the dimers visited by the c and d lines are of the three types\nwhile in region II, they are:\nAnother property of c and d lines which is clear from their definition on D is the fact\nthat between two of them, or below the lowest one, or above the highest one, the tiling\nis frozen and uses only horizontal rhombi. This is easily established, starting from the\nleftmost corner of any domain of the triangular lattice lying between two successive lines,\nor between the upper or lower one and the boundary, and proceeding iteratively. This\nalso means that the data of c and d lines are sufficient to characterize the tiling entirely.\nWhen restated on O, this property means that c and d lines are separated in region I by\nonly horizontal dimers and in region II by only vertical ones. Moreover, these separating\ndimers connect \u25e6 sites to \u2022 ones from left to right in region I and from top to bottom in\nregion II. We thus have\nLemma 2. All vertical dimers of the region I and all horizontal dimers of region II are\nvisited by c or d lines. Also, all horizontal dimers connecting \u2022 to \u25e6 sites from left to right\nin region I and from top to bottom in region II are visited by c or d lines.\n9\n\n\fL\nFig. 11: The immediate neighborhood of L. Dimers are represented in red, and fixed\nedges in light blue. Only two situations may occur for FPL paths: either they cross L via a\ndimer on the left and a fixed horizontal edge on the right, or they simply touch L without\ncrossing via a fixed edge followed by a dimer on the right side.\n\nLemma 3. All c and d lines must go to L.\nThis is obvious on D: the c and d lines enter D through vertical edges along V; they must\n\nnecessarily exit through vertical edges again, and the only possibility to do so is through\n\nL\u00b1 , see Fig. 10. From the standpoint of O, this is less obvious: by parity arguments, all\n\nsites of O on L are \u25e6 sites. By lemma 2, it follows that any c or d line reaching L must do so\nvia a dimer. On Fig. 2 we observe that no fixed edge may touch L from the left side hence\n\nthe only way a FPL path may touch L from the left is via a dimer, which, as it ends up\non a \u25e6 site, must by Lemma 2 be also part of a c or d line. So any FPL path that touches\n\nL from the left and therefore crosses it, as it is prolongated via a fixed horizontal edge on\nthe right of L, corresponds to the end of a c or d line coming from the left. Analogously,\nany FPL path touching L from the right but not crossing it corresponds to the end of a\nc or d line coming from above. By fully-packedness, only these two situations (crossing,\nor touching from the right without crossing) may occur, in view of the disposition of fixed\nedges, see Fig. 11 for illustration. On the total of c + d sites of L, some of them, say i,\ncorrespond to crossings of FPL paths, and the other c + d \u2212 i to touching without crossing.\n\nThese add up to the c + d c and d lines introduced above.\n\nLemma 4. i = c, hence all c lines reach L from the left and all d lines reach it from\nabove.\nAs noted above, the external endpoint of L is the center of the set of c FPL nested arches.\nIt is clear that these arches must cross either L or its prolongation across the central square.\nLet us show that they cross L and that they are in one-to one correspondence with the c or\nd lines ending up on L from the left. Let us prolongate the lines crossing L into FPL paths\nby letting them alternate between fixed edges and dimers. The fixed edges on the right of\nL being all horizontal, let us orient them from left to right. The FPL paths visit them in\n10\n\n\fj<d\nL'\n\ni+j=c+d\nL\ni<c\n\nFig. 12: Each of the i c or d lines terminating on L from the left corresponds to an FPL\narch centered on C, hence i \u2264 c. The same holds for the j c or d lines touching L' from\nthe left: each of them correspond to a FPL arch centered on D, hence j \u2264 d. But as\ni + j = c + d, we must have i = c and j = d\n\nthis direction. In particular, such a path can never cross L again and can only bounce off\nit. This means that all FPL paths crossing L must exit O along its right border. The same\n\nreasoning in the region to the left of L shows that these FPL paths must enter the grid\nfrom the lower border. The c FPL paths are the only ones which connect the bottom to\nthe right, and therefore i \u2264 c, see Fig.12. The same reasoning applied to the line L', with\nc replaced by d shows that there are j \u2264 d c or d lines crossing L'. But the only way for a\n\nc or d line to reach L from above is by first crossing L', hence there are at most j \u2264 d c\n\nor d lines reaching L from above. As the total of c and d lines reaching L is c + d = i + j,\nwe must have i = c and j = d.\nLemma 5. From the non-intersecting c and d lines, one reconstructs a unique FPL\nconfiguration of type (a, b, c, d).\nWe start from a configuration of non-intersecting c and d lines going from the left vertical\nborder V of O to the line L, with the rule that every second edge is horizontal and travelled\n\nfrom left to right in region I and vertical and travelled from top to bottom in region II,\nwhile the arrival sites on L form two disjoint sets of respectively c and d sites. We then\nconstruct dimers by keeping every second edge (those going from a \u2022 to a \u25e6) on the c and\n\nd lines, and adjoining them the horizontal edges connecting \u25e6 to \u2022 sites from left to right\nin region I, and from top to bottom in region II, in all regions between the c and/or d\nlines: this gives a complete dimer covering. Upon addition of the fixed edges as specified\nin sect. 1.1, one gets a FPL configuration. By the same argument as in Lemma 4, there\n11\n\n\fare c FPL paths crossing L and d crossing L'. This exhausts all external edges on the right\nvertical side of the grid, and therefore the sets of c and d nested arches are next to one\nanother.\n\nc\n\nL''\n\na\n\nb\n\nL'\n\nd\n\nL\n\nc\nb\n\nL''' a\n\nd\n\nFig. 13: Artist's view of the a, b, c, d lines on O\u2032 .\n\nThe same discussion must now be repeated for the pairs (d, a) and (b, c). One introduces the two new sets of lines a and b, which start from the segments of the boundary\nof O\u2032 marked in Fig. 13, and which are de Bruijn lines describing chains of tiles sharing\nedges parallel to a certain direction. One also continues the previous lines c and d across\nthe segment L up to the boundary. The segments L\" and L'\", which are the continuations\nof L and L', respectively, across the center of the central square, have lengths a + d and\nb + c. One may then apply the analysis of Lemmas 1-5 to the pairs (a, d) and (b, c).\nIn particular, there are a FPL paths centered on A which cross the segment L\" on sites\ndisjoint from those of the d lines; and likewise for the b lines centered on B and the c\nlines, across the segment L'\". One concludes that the FPL configuration contains at least\nfour sets of a, b, c and d nested arches. As a + b + c + d = n, this exhausts the number\nof FPL paths (and possibly also the patience of the reader!), establishes the Lemma and\ncompletes the proof the Theorem.\n12\n\n\f1.4. Remarks\n1. From the discussion above, in particular from Lemma 5, it follows that\nCorollary Any dimer configuration on the octagonal grid O or any tiling of O\u2032 yields a\nFPL of type (a + p, b \u2212 p, c + p, d \u2212 p), for some p, \u2212c \u2264 p \u2264 d.\n\nIndeed, start from the domino grid pertaining to any (a, b, c, d) FPL configuration.\n\nFor any dimer configuration on O or the associated tiling of O\u2032 , draw the corresponding\n\nnon intersecting lines on D. Let c\u2032 be the number of those which reach L\u2212 , d\u2032 that of\nthose reaching L+ , with c + d = c\u2032 + d\u2032 . By lemma 5, one reconstructs a unique FPL\n\nconfiguration of type (a\u2032 , b\u2032 , c\u2032 , d\u2032 ) with a\u2032 \u2212 a = c\u2032 \u2212 c = b \u2212 b\u2032 = d\u2032 \u2212 d =: p.\n\nThis corollary implies a sum rule on numbers of FPL configurations in terms of that\n\nof dimers\n\ninf(b,d)\n\nX\n\np=\u2212 inf(a,c)\n\nAn (a + p, b \u2212 p, c + p, d \u2212 p) = #dimers on O ,\n\n(1.1)\n\nof which we shall present examples in sect. 2.3.\n2. It is legitimate to ask if the elementary moves\n\n\u2194\n\nor\n\n\u2194\n\non dimers are ergodic,\n\ni.e. suffice to span all the FPL configurations of a given type (a, b, c, d). Equivalently, are\nthe moves\n\n\u2194\n\nacting on tilings ergodic? Contrary to the case of three sets of nested\n\narches [5], we cannot rely on the picture of cube stacking, because of the conic singularity\nin the tiling caused by the cut. The third picture we used, namely the non intersecting\nlines, provides the answer. It is easy to prove by contradiction that all configurations\nof non intersecting lines c and d on the domain D are generated from one of them by\nrepeated applications away from the branch point of the elementary move\n\n\u2194\n\n(and\n\ntheir rotated). This establishes the ergodicity property for the above moves of dimers or\nof tiles 2 . Note on the other hand that the move\n\n\u2194\n\nacting on the central square\n\nconnects FPL configurations of types (a, b, c, d) and (a \u00b1 1, b \u2213 1, c \u00b1 1, d \u2213 1).\n\n3. In view of this ergodicity, we may now reconsider the two special configurations, \"empty\"\nand \"full\", depicted in Fig. 4 and 8. What makes them extremal is the fact that only two\n\nelementary moves can act upon them. (This should be compared with the unique move\nin the ordinary case of cube stacking, when one considers the empty or the full box.) The\nlocations of these moves are what is represented by the blue dots in Fig. 4.\n2\n\nThis result is stronger than the classical result stating that the moves\n\non tilings of simply connected domains of the triangular lattice [10].\n\n13\n\n\u2194\n\nare ergodic\n\n\f4. Note that the tiling problem we have to deal with is reminiscent of but not identical\nto the problem treated in [9], namely that of a centro-symmetric octagon by six species of\ntiles.\n\n2. Counting configurations.\nIn this section, we use the bijection of Theorem 1 to actually count the numbers of FPL\nconfigurations of type (a, b, c, d).\n2.1.

The lines must enter through the light blue points (on the left)\nand exit through the upper part of the cut except at the points m1 , m2 , m3 or through\nits lower part, at the points m1 , m2 , m3 . The elementary steps for the c and d lines, in\ndirections i and j, are shown in the medallion.\n\nIt is simplest to use the c and d lines on the domain D. The fact that they stop on\n\nsegments L\u00b1 reduces the counting of configurations to the standard problem of enumerating\n\nall non-intersecting paths from one set of points to another. As the tiles crossed by c and d\nlines only have two orientations (and all have two vertical edges), the corresponding paths\nmay only go in two directions say i, j at each point, as shown in the medallion of Fig.14.\n14\n\n\fMoreover, we know that the c lines end on the lower part of the cut L\u2212 at c distinct\npoints, marked in yellow in Fig.14, and that the d lines reach the upper part of the cut\nL+ on d distinct points, forming the complement of the c. Let us denote by m1 , m2 , ..., mc\nthe positions of these c points counted from bottom to top on L\u2212 , with 1 \u2264 m1 < m2 <\n... < mc \u2264 c + d, while their positions must be counted from top to bottom on L+ .\n\nWe now have the well-posed problem of computing the number of configurations of\n\nnon-intersecting c and d lines with elementary steps i or j going on D from its left side\n\n(light blue points in Fig.14) to its right (yellow points in Fig.14), and such that the lower\nc lines exit through points m1 , m2 , ..., mc of the lower part of the cut, while the upper\nd ones exit through their d complements on the upper part of the cut. We denote by\nfm1 ,m2 ,...,mc (a, b, c, d) the number of such configurations.\n\n2.2. A fermionic formula for path counting\nIn this section we recall the so-called Lindstr\u00f6m-Gessel-Viennot [11] formula for counting\nthe number N (A1 , A2 , ..., AN |E1 , E2 , ..., EN ) of non-intersecting paths from a set of points\nA1 , A2 , ..., AN to a set of points E1 , E2 , ..., EN of the square lattice, such that only ele-\n\nmentary steps to the right and to the top are allowed. Let P (Ai , Ej ) denote the number\nof paths from the point Ai to the point Ej with these only allowed elementary steps, then\nwe have (see [11] and further references in [12])\nN (A1 , A2 , ..., AN |E1 , E2 , ..., EN ) = det (P (Ai , Ej ))1\u2264i,j\u2264N\n\n(2.1)\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\ni\n...\u03c8E\n(For physicists, recall this is just the expression of the 2N -point function h\u03c8A1 ...\u03c8AN \u03c8E\nN\n1\n\nof free fermions, expressed as the Slater determinant of their 2-point function P (Ai , Ej ) =\nP\n\u2217\nh\u03c8Ai \u03c8E\ni, when their action is \u03b1\u2192\u03b2 \u03c8\u03b1\u2217 \u03c8\u03b2 , summed over all edges \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b2 of the square\nj\n\nlattice, oriented from left to right and from bottom to top.)\n2.3. Computation of An (a, b, c, d)\n\nTo apply formula (2.1) to the computation of fm1 ,..,mc (a, b, c, d), we just have to record\nthe relative positions of the entry and exit points of the c and d lines. The solution goes\nas follows. We first construct the matrix M of size (c + d) \u00d7 (c + d) whose Mi,j entry is\nthe binomial coefficient\n\nMi,j =\n\n\u0012\n\na+b+c+d\u2212j\na+d\u2212i\n15\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(2.2)\n\n\fThe matrix element Mi,j counts generically the number of paths between the i-th entry\n\npoint counted from bottom to top (in light blue in Fig.14) and the j-th exit, counted from\n\ntop to bottom on the upper part of the cut (in yellow in Fig.14). To take into account\nthe missing images of the points on the lower part of the cut (filled black dots in Fig.14),\nwe must erase the columns j = m1 , m2 , ..., mc of this matrix, and append instead c new\ncolumns vk , k = 1, 2, ..., c,\n(vk )i =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\na+b\n,\na + c + 2d + 1 \u2212 i \u2212 mk\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhich count the total number of paths from the i-th entry point to the exit point mk on\nthe lower part of the cut. Then the determinant of the resulting matrix M(m1 , m2 , ..., mc)\n\ngives fm1 ,..,mc (a, b, c, d):\n\nfm1 ,..,mc (a, b, c, d) = det (M(m1 , m2 , ..., mc))\n\n(2.4)\n\nand finally\nX\n\nAn (a, b, c, d) =\n\nfm1 ,m2 ,***,mc (a, b, c, d)\n\n(2.5)\n\n1\u2264m1 <m2 <***<mc \u2264c+d\n\nThis formula is very explicit if not too easy to manipulate.

FPL and dimer countings\nAccording to the third remark of sect. 1.4 and eq. (1.1), it may be interesting to compute\nalso the total number of dimers on the octagonal grid O.\n\nFig. 15: Dimer counting : the case (1,1,1,1).\n\nWe shall illustrate this by an example. In the cases of an (m, 1, m, 1) FPL, the\ndomino grid O is made of a unit square surrounded by rectangular dominos. According\n\nto Kasteleyn [13], one computes the number of dimers on this graph by orienting its edges\n\nin such a way that along every elementary closed circuit the number of edges of either\norientation is odd. The number of dimers is then the pfaffian of the resulting signed\nadjacency matrix. The case m = 1 is depicted in Fig. 15.\nSince these graphs are 2-colored, their (antisymmetric) signed adjacency matrix is\nmade of two off-diagonal blocks,\n\u0012\n\n0\n\u2212GTm\n\nGm\n0\n\n\u0013\n\nand the pfaffian is just (up to a sign) the determinant of one of these blocks. (It is 9 for\nthe case (1, 1, 1, 1)).\nIn general, one constructs the graphs and their adjacency matrix by a recursive procedure of adding layers of dominos, as depicted in Fig. 16.\nOne finds that the determinants Dm , thus the numbers of dimers, are alternatingly\nperfect squares or doubles of perfect squares. This is a consequence of the 4-fold symmetry\nof the grid, as discussed in [14]. (In the terminology of that paper, the graphs Gm are\n4-odd-symmetric, and their Z4 quotient has (m + 1)2 vertices.)\n\ndm :=\n\np\nD2m\u22121 = 3, 70, 13167, 20048886, 247358122583, 24736951705389664,\n\n20054892679528741176540, 131821539275853806053297420440, * * *\n17\n\nfor m = 1, 2, * * * , 8\n\n\f2\n2\n\nGm\n\nG m+1 =\n\nFig. 16: Constructing Gm+1 from Gm (in black) by adding one layer of (blue) dominos.\n\nwhile\n\u03b4m :=\n\np\nD2m /2 = 8, 526, 280772, 1215446794, 42663813089328,\n\n12142696908022734304, 28022410984084414473869168,\n524367885668519092847372976461256, * * *\n\nalso for m = 1, 2, * * * , 8\n\nCuriously, one \u0010observes 3 that these\nnumbers are given by the determinant D\u0302(L, \u03b8) :=\n\u0011\n\u0001\n\u221a\ne\u2212i\u03b8L/2 det1\u2264i.,j\u2264L i+j\u22122\n+ ei\u03b8 \u03b4ij for \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, namely that Dm = D\u0302(m + 1, \u03c0/2).\ni\u22121\n\nThis may be proved by writing D\u0302(m + 1, \u03c0/2)D\u0302(m + 1, \u2212\u03c0/2) = det(I + T 2 ), where T is\n\u0001\nthe matrix with entries Tij = i+j\u22122\n, i, j = 1, 2, ..., m + 1, and expanding the determinant\ni\u22121\n\nin terms of multiple minors of T 2 . More precisely, introducing \u2206m (\u03bb) = det(\u03bbI + T 2 ), we\nhave the expansion\n\u2206m (\u03bb) =\n\nm+1\nX\nk=0\n\n\u03bbm+1\u2212k\n\nX\n\n1\u2264p1 <...<pk \u2264m+1\n\ndet\n\n1\u2264i,j\u2264k\n\n(T 2 )pi ,pj\n\n\u0001\n\n(2.8)\n\nThe coefficient of \u03bbm+1\u2212k in this polynomial is then identified with the sum of determinants\n(2.5), with a = m+1\u2212k, b = k, c = m+1\u2212k, d = k, by expanding the latter with respect to\nsome of their columns as follows.
