INTRODUCTION\nAdvances in information and communication technologies (ICT) are changing individuals' life,\nand a new trend since 21st century is online communities. Online communities enable individuals\nnot only to post user generated content (UGC) such as feedback, opinions and personal\ninformation [1], but also exchange information with others who they may never meet.\nResearchers have examined how online communities shape individuals' daily life and what the\nimplications are for practitioners and researchers [19]; how to transfer users of collaborative\nwebsites into contributors [1]; and the needs, i.e., recognition and appreciation of their\ncontribution, promotional opportunities or because of sense of responsibility, of the knowledge\nsharing in online communities inside or outside of an organization [18].\nWhile previous studies have tried to understand participating activities in online communities as\nwell as how to sustain online communities [11, 32], relatively few studies have tried to classify\nparticipants in online communities [10, 28]. Further, previous studies mainly focus on those\nparticipants who answer questions or contribute content to online communities, there are no\nestablished terminologies for participants who engage in other activities (e.g., make comment,\nprovide feedback). Although there is a kind of individuals called lurker, the term \"lurker\" may not\nbe suitable in many contexts; given that those individuals do engage in certain activities in online\ncommunities, and these activities can also be important to online communities.\nDOI : 10.5121/ijmit.2012.4101\n\n1\n\n\fInternational Journal of Managing Information Technology (IJMIT) Vol.4, No.1, February 2012\n\nTherefore, in this paper, we try to contribute online community research by classifying different\nparticipants in online communities. In our study we use individuals and participants\ninterchangeably, and use information to refer to useful and valuable content, and content to refer\nto all of the posts from online communities. There are different types of online communities [7],\nand individuals go to online communities for different purposes. Our study only focuses on those\nonline communities where participants share and exchange information with one another [14],\nand other types of online communities (e.g., discussion board for online education, online social\nnetworks) are beyond the scope of this study. We admit that our study is only an initial step\ntoward deeper understanding of participants in online communities.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, we conduct a brief review of previous\nliterature. We then analyze posts from one online community, and classify them into different\ntypes. Next, we try to clarify the exact meanings of contribute and lurk. Based on these\ndiscussions, we propose a continuum to classify participants in online communities. Finally, we\ndiscuss the implications for future studies.\n\n2. AN OVERVIEW OF PARTICIPANTS IN ONLINE COMMUNITIES\n2.1 Contributors\nMany previous studies classify (or just mentions) two types of participants in online communities:\ncontributors (or poster) and lurkers [22, 28]. While the concept of contributors receives little\ndebate, there are competing ideas about who the lurkers really are. For example, Tedjamulia et al.\n[28] refer lurkers to two types of individuals: (1) those who just view posts; (2) those who do not\nfind a specific type of information and ask for it. In another study, Takahashi et al. [27] refer\nlurkers to those who do not post any message. Preece et al. [22, p.202] even go one step further\nand argue that a lurker is \"someone who has never posted in the community to which he/she\nbelongs\".\nTherefore, there are debates about the definition of lurker. To better understand the concept of\ncontributor and lurker, we first go through Merriam-Webster dictionary to find out what\ncontribute and lurk exactly mean. There are three meanings for contribute: 1) to give or supply in\ncommon with others (e.g., contribute money to a cause); 2) to supply (as an article) for a\npublication; 3) to play a significant part in bringing about an end or result (e.g., many players\nhave contributed to the team's success).\nBased on abovementioned meanings, the meaning of contributor in online communities is derived\nfrom the second and third meaning. Specifically, previous literature considers participants\nproviding new information play a significant part in sustaining online communities, and therefore\ncalls them \"contributors\". After all, without valuable information, online communities cannot\nattract other participants and are likely to fail [32].\nHowever, these discussions bring another question: are there other ways to help sustain online\ncommunities by providing some \"content\"? Online communities allow individuals to interact with\neach other [2]. In such a conversational environment, individuals \"create and share knowledge\nthrough dialog with questions and answers\" [30, p. 266]. Phang et al. [20, p. 721] also argue that\nthe value of online communities depends on \"ongoing participation in terms of two key activities\ni.e., knowledge seeking and contribution\". Therefore, participants who ask questions may also\nhelp sustain online community by finding what information is not available and initiating\ninteraction among participants. In other words, besides contributors, there are other types of\nparticipants who can also help sustain online communities.\n\n2\n\n\fInternational Journal of Managing Information Technology (IJMIT) Vol.4, No.1, February 2012\n\nIn fact, recent studies begin to pay more attention to other types of participants. For example,\nMajchrzak et al. [16] categorize contributors into two kinds: \"synthesizers\" and \"adders\".\nSynthesizers are those mainly to influence other (wiki) users (e.g., influence the task by finding a\nnew solution), while adders mainly provide new information. Clearly, synthesizers also help\nsustain online communities. Besides, information that is useful to one individual may be\ndistracting to another [3], and other types of participants can help clarify the usefulness of the\ninformation.\nTo summarize, other participants actively engaging in online communities can also supply some\n\"content\" and help sustain online communities. Therefore, previous definitions on contributor\n[28] are limited, and participants in online communities need to be classified further.\n\n2.1 Lurkers\nNext we examine the definition of lurker. According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, there are\nfour meanings for lurk: 1) to lie in wait in a place of concealment; 2) to move furtively or\ninconspicuously; 3) to persist in staying; 4) to read messages on an Internet discussion forum (as\na newsgroup or chat room) without contributing.\nBased on these meanings mentioned above, lurkers are those who just read posts in online\ncommunities (fourth meaning). That meaning is derived from the first meaning of lurk, stating\nthat lurkers are those who hide from other individuals in online communities. This explanation is\nconsistent with the first kind of lurkers from Tedjamulia et al. [28], but not consistent with their\nsecond one.\nResearchers also realize that there are different types of lurkers. For example, Dennen [6] argues\nthat there are four different types of lurkers: 1) individuals who do not post anything; 2)\nindividuals who read but do not post in a given discussion; 3) individuals who are new and not\nready to post; 4) individuals who never want to post. The result of this study implies that\nindividuals go to online communities with different purposes, and the overall trend of activities\nfrom individuals are probably more accurate to classify their roles in online communities since\nthe overall trend of activities can better represent individuals' purposes to go to online\ncommunities. In other words, participants who are new to the online communities should be\ntreated as lurkers in a traditional sense because these participants are not ready yet. Once these\nparticipants are familiar with the online community, they are likely to contribute and post useful\ninformation.\nTo summarize, the definition of contributors and lurkers remains debatable, and we need to\nclassify participants in more depth. To achieve that goal, we first try to understand the activities\nin online communities by examining posts in an online community and develop a schema to\nclassify these posts.\n\n3. EXAMINE ACTIVITIES IN ONLINE COMMUNITIES\nIn this part, we examine activities (posts) in online communities. Although some studies consider\nelectronic environment suffering from social cue deficiencies [23, 25, 26], other studies also find\nthat even \"plain\" media such as email can contain rich communication information [17].\nTherefore, it is fairly important to understand how individuals participants in online communities.\nIn a recent study, Hrastinski [10] lists six ways of participants: 1) participation as accessing\nenvironments; 2) participation as writing; 3) participation as quality writing; 4) participation as\nwriting and reading; 5) participation as actual and perceived writing; 6) participation as taking\n\n3\n\n\fInternational Journal of Managing Information Technology (IJMIT) Vol.4, No.1, February 2012\n\npart and joining in a dialogue. Based on this list, writing and posting is an important way to\nparticipate, and we try to classify different posts from participants.\nTo examine activities and classify posts, we select DIS Discussion Forums (www.disboards.com)\nas the sources of posts. DIS Discussion Forum (DIS) is one of the largest and liveliest Disney\nforums. Participants in DIS share information and discuss a variety of topics such as Disney\ntheme parks, resorts and Disney Cruise Line with each other. Therefore, DIS is consistent with\nour focus and is a good example to examine online communities where participants share\ninformation.\nWe select post as the analysis unit since the basic unit in online communities is a \"comment-byparticipant-on-topic-at-time\" [31]. Also, we focus on dialog in this study, which is one of the two\nparadigms for the sharing and distribution of information in online communities [31]. By\nanalyzing the posts from DIS during November and December in 2010, we classify posts of DSI\ninto seven categories (see Table 1):\nTable 1. Post Types\nPost Type\nPost Type I\nPost Type II\nPost Type III\nPost Type IV\nPost Type V\nPost Type VI\nPost Type N\n\nShort description\nPosts which provide new\ninformation\nPosts which ask questions\nResponse posts which answer\nquestions\nResponse posts which provide\nfeedback\nResponse posts which thank\nfor help\nResponse posts which say\nsomething bad\nViewing without posting\n\nPosition in a\nthread\n\nAffect\n\nExplicit or\nImplicit\n\nIn the beginning\n\nNeutral\n\nExplicit\n\nAnywhere\n\nNeutral\n\nExplicit\n\nIn the middle\n\nNeutral\n\nExplicit\n\nIn the middle\n\nNeutral\n\nExplicit\n\nIn the middle\n\nPositive\n\nExplicit\n\nIn the middle\n\nNegative\n\nExplicit\n\nN/A\n\nNegative\n\nImplicit\n\n3.1 Posts which provide new information (Post Type I):\nWhen individuals have some new information to share, they may put the information in a single\npost. The post usually appears in the beginning of a thread. We refer this kind of posts to \"Post\nType I\". \"Post Type I\" provides interesting or valuable information and is usually relevant to\nother participants from the same online community. For example, here is an example from DIS:\n\"This thread is intended to discuss most aspects of Walt Disney World (WDW) ticketing...\"\nIn fact, that post is so useful that the administrator put it at the top of one subforum.\n\n3.2 Posts which ask questions (Post Type II):\nOnline communities cannot contain every piece of information for which their participants look.\nEven if the relevant information does exist, that piece of information may be quite difficult for\nparticipants to locate. Therefore, individuals sometime (start threads and) ask questions. We refer\nthis kind of posts to \"Post Type II\". For example, here is a post from DIS:\n\n4\n\n\fInternational Journal of Managing Information Technology (IJMIT) Vol.4, No.1, February 2012\n\n\"Hi! I'm planning my first trip to Disney with my family. I would like to be able to find out which\ncharacters will be where and when, so I can make the most of each park we visit. I'm sure in the\nMK they will be everywhere, but I would especially love to know when Mike and Sully and the\nCars characters will be appearing in HS.\"\nSince participants from the same online community usually share similar interests, other\nparticipants may also want to ask the same or similar question. If the information required is\nindeed not available, others may answer the question and thus increase the information base of\nonline communities (refer to Post Type III).\n\n3.3 Response posts which answer questions (Post Type III):\nWhen someone asks a question, other participants may know the answer and response to that\nquestion, by either providing relevant information directly or referring to previous posts if the\nanswer already exists. We refer this kind of posts to \"Post Type III\". For example, here is one of\nanswers from DIS to the example question of the Post Type II:\n\"You can also ask at guest services once you are in the park. They can tell you when where and if\na character will be there that day.\"\nPost Type III is often context-based. However, Post Type III does contain valuable and useful\ninformation, and increases the information base of online communities, which you can see from\nthe above example. Post Type III also functions as the intermediary connecting participants who\nhave questions to those who know answers.\n\n3.4 Response posts which provide feedback (Post Type IV):\nAfter participants who ask questions get answers, they may not feel that their questions are really\nanswered. The reason may be that individuals who give answers misunderstand the questions, or\nthat those participants who ask the questions need clarification. In these situations, participants\nwho ask questions provide feedback through response posts. We refer this kind of posts to \"Post\nType IV\". \"Post Type IV\" can also come from individuals who try to answer questions, but find\nthat they need more details. For example, here are three sequential posts from DIS.\nA: \"...can anyone tell me what time the Jedi Academy is held each day??\" (Post Type II)\nB: \"My strategy would be to arrive at Rope Drop, ride TSM or fastpass then sprint to Jedi\nAcademy and wait.\" (Post Type III)\nA: \"Where exactly is this in the park? My 7y/o is SW obsessed and has every light saber known to\nman, lol\" (Post Type IV)\nAlthough Post Type IV can also be a question, it should not be equal to Post Type II. The purpose\nof Post Type II is to get some new information, while that of Post Type IV is to clarify and\nachieve mutual understanding.\nAnother possibility is that someone posts something and others express what they think about it.\nFor example:\nA: \"Check out this website its like people of walmart only at Disneyworld, to funny,\nhttp://www.peopleofthepark.com/\" (Post Type I)\n\n5\n\n\fInternational Journal of Managing Information Technology (IJMIT) Vol.4, No.1, February 2012\n\nB: \"People of the Park is interesting, but a little on the mean side. Maybe I'm just scared I'll show\nup on there!\" (Post Type IV)\nC: \"Me, too. I can think of one specific instance this past July. It has to do with a matching shirt I\nwas guilted into wearing.\" (Post Type IV)\nPost Type IV is usually the middle stage between Post Type II and Post Type III. Sometimes Post\nType IV is not needed, while sometimes many Post Type IV posts are needed to clarify the\ncontexts. These posts may not contain any valuable information, but are important to make\n\"conversation\" between participants keep going and get answers finally. Post Types I to IV are\naffective neural, from the perspective of contributors1.\n\n3.5 Response posts which thank for help (Post Type V):\nWhen participants who ask questions receive answers that they want, they probably appreciate the\nhelp and effort from others. We refer this kind of posts to \"Post Type V\". For example, here is an\nexample from DIS:\n\"awesome! thanks for the help. I haven't checked the links yet, but heading there now. Great\nmaps, Robo!\"\nBased on the above example, we can tell that the Post Type V post usually contains positive\naffect to contributors.\n\n3.6 Response posts which say something bad (Post Type VI):\nSometimes participants may feel angry (about previous posts) and throw bad words into online\ncommunities. We refer this kind of posts to \"Post Type VI\". Post Type VI post usually contains\nnegative affect to contributors. Although we did not find such type of posts in DIS during\nanalyzing, we do come across them occasionally from other contexts and decide to include this\ntype to make our classification more complete.\n\n3.7 Viewing without posting (Post Type N)\nIndividuals may simply view rather than post something in the online communities. We refer this\nkind of \"posts\" to \"Post Type N\". Post Type N is not a real post. However, some changes may\noccur after viewing. For example, some online communities have the function to count how many\ntimes individuals have viewed a thread. So even if individuals just view posts, this kind of \"post\"\nwill increase the count of viewing by one. Some contributors may feel honoured that others take\ntime to go through their posts even without responses. However, we consider Post Type N to be\nimplicitly affectively negative to contributors for the following reasons: in many cases\nadministrators encourage responses, and many participants who contributed information in the\nonline communities ask others how they feel about the information were posted. If other\nparticipants just view the posts without providing any response or feedback, the online\ncommunity contributors don't know whether the information they provide need further\nmodification or clarification. Thus, viewing without posting do not help contributors understand\nhow useful their information is.\nWe admit that just examining one online community is a limitation of this study. Nevertheless,\nwe believe that most of the post types identified can be also applied to other contexts.

For example, one post can both comment on the previous\nposts and raise a new question.\n\n4. A CONTINUUM OF PARTICIPANTS IN ONLINE\nCOMMUNITIES\nTakahashi et al. [27] argue that there are five factors which can be used to classify participants\nfrom online communities, including expectations of purpose of an online community, stance on\nparticipation, personal specialty and interests, attitude towards information handling, and\nawareness of the existence of others. To separate individuals into meaningful subdivision, as well\nas keep the classification parsimonious enough, we argue that classification of participants in\nonline communities should be based on their overall activities (or tendency) in a certain time\nperiod, and the value2 of different types of participants to a certain online community are indeed\nalong a continuum (refer to figure 1). This criterion is consistent with expectations of purpose and\nstance on participation from Takahashi et al. [27]. Thus, we classify all individuals from a certain\nonline community (we refer it to X Community in this part) into seven categories.\n\nFigure 1. A Continuum of Participants in Online Communities\nOutsider: Individuals who do not know X community. They may or may not be interested in the\ncontent from the X community.\nNon-interested knower: Individuals who know X community but never browse its posts. They\nare currently not interested in the content from the X community. They may become interested in\nthe content from the X community in the future. This concept is consistent with the concept of\nshirkers from Egan et al. [8].\nTrouble maker: Individuals who post bad words (Post Type VI) in X community. Once\nindividuals put Post Type VI posts, which can hurt the X community by letting other participants\nfeel bad. Therefore, even if these individuals may provide new information sometimes (Post Type\nI or III), they are not desired by the X community because other participants may leave the X\ncommunity because of Post Type VI posts.\nLurker: Individuals who just consume without providing any new information. In other words,\nthey just \"put\" Post Type N. While they increase the total number of visiting of X community,\nthey also generate Post Type N posts. Therefore, their overall value to the X community is\nroughly zero.\n\n2\n\nWe define value as the degree to which individuals help sustain online communities.\n7\n\n\fInternational Journal of Managing Information Technology (IJMIT) Vol.4, No.1, February 2012\n\nNon-contributing Participants: Individuals who do not provide any new information, but\nconsume information or participate in other activities. They can ask questions (Post Type II), give\nfeedback (Post Type IV), and thank others (Post Type V).\nPartial-contributing Participant: Individuals who contribute sometimes, but they usually\nconsume information from X community or participate in other activities. These participants still\nprovide new information (Post Type I) or answer questions (Post Type III) sometimes, but they\nusually read posts or participate in other activities (Post Type II, IV, and V).\nContributor: Individuals who provide new information (Post Type I and III) regularly. They do\nspend some time browsing posts, but their main activities are contributing.\nIn the continuum, we try to avoid the confusion of the \"contribute\" concept discussed early by\nexplicitly adding the term \"participate\". Thus, we differentiate other activities (Post Type II, IV,\nand V) from providing new information (Post Type I and III), and narrow the meaning of\n\"contribute\". We put non-interested knower closer to the X community than outsider because the\nnon-interested knowers at least know the existence of the X community.\nIn a certain study researchers can define the exact meaning of time period according to their\nresearch questions and interests. For example, if one study wants to examine participants'\nmonthly activity pattern, then the time period is one month and classification of participants can\naccord to their overall activities in every month.\nAlthough it is tempting to have individuals who just contribute, this type of individuals cannot\nexist in the reality. To answer questions, individuals have to go through other participants' posts.\nEven for those who often provide information spontaneously (Post Type I), these contributors\nalso want to read others' responses to see how others think about their posts or if there is\nsomething missing in their posts.\n\n5. WHAT ONLINE COMMUNITIES NEED IN DIFFERENT STAGES\nGiven that only partial-contributing participants and contributors actively contribute in online\ncommunities, these two kinds of participants are probably the most desired in online\ncommunities3. However, online communities may vary in the stage of their life cycles [21].\nTherefore, online communities may want to put different emphasis on different types of\nparticipants in different stages. Table 2 lists the short description of each stage, and Figure 2\nshows how the number of participants changes in each stage. Below we provide a more detailed\ndiscussion of each stage.\n\n3\n\nHere we do not mean that non-contributing participants are not desired at all. As we discussed early, these\nparticipants do have values to the online community, but their value is relatively less than that of partialcontributing participants and contributors.\n8\n\n\fInternational Journal of Managing Information Technology (IJMIT) Vol.4, No.1, February 2012\n\nTable 2. Different Stages Of Online Community Life Cycle\nStage\nAttraction\nBuild-Up\nMaintenance\nDeterioration/\nEnd\n\nShort description\nOnline communities start to launch; Contributors provide much\ninteresting information, and individuals from outside are attracted.\nAs more and more individuals are attracted, they begin to build up the\nrelationship with online communities and participate regularly.\nThe number of participants passes a critical mass; the number of daily\nposts is so large that online communities focus more on the\nmaintenance of posts.\nThe rate of providing new information is decreasing; participants start\nto leave online communities and stop participating.\n\nFigure 2. Online Communities in Different Stages\nDuring the early stages (Attraction and Build-Up), online communities just start and need to\nattract more individuals. Since the useful and interesting information of the online communities is\nthe key to attract individuals outside, contributors are most desired [32]. During these stages, the\nnumber of participants is not large enough and there is not enough information in the online\ncommunities. If most participants just comment instead of providing new information, the\ninformation from the online communities may become out of date soon and participants may find\nthat there is not much to gain [22]. Therefore, partial-contributing participants are less desired\nduring this stage, and the online communities need many contributors who contribute a lot and\nregularly.\nWhen online communities become mature, and the size of participants becomes large enough\n(exceeds a critical mass), the emphasis of the online communities probably switches to\nmaintenance, and other types of participants are more desired than those of early stages. Butler\n[3] points out that the main focus of online communities comes to the maintenance with the\ngrowth of community size. In Wiki context, Kittur et al. [13] find that as the size of Wikipedia\ngrows, the rate of creating new information is decreasing, while the amount of maintenance work\nis increasing. Vi\u00e9gas et al. [29] also notice that the fastest growing area of Wikipedia is group\ncoordination, which Wikipedia community places a strong emphasis on, and group coordination\nsupports strategic planning of edits and enforcement of standard guideline. Therefore, in the stage\nof maintenance, non-contributing and partial contributing participants become more important.\n9\n\n\fInternational Journal of Managing Information Technology (IJMIT) Vol.4, No.1, February 2012\n\nThey may provide little new information, but they actively engage in maintenance-related\nactivities.\nNon-contributing and partial contributing participants can also be important to contributors.\nContributors need other individuals to participate (e.g., join the \"conversation\") to help them keep\ncontributing. Butler et al. [4] point out that the most fundamental investment in online\ncommunities is active participation, including posting content, responding to posts, and\norganizing discussion. From a collaboration standpoint [5], contributors need confirmation from\nother individuals once they provide some information. From a resource standpoint, membership\nsize is a kind of resource: audience resource. When contributors provide new information, they\nalso look for audiences' ideas. In other words, they compete with audience resource [3], and need\nother individuals to recognize their effort of providing new information [11, 12, 32].\nFurther, Non-contributing and partial contributing participants can help identify what pieces of\nnew information are needed. Hahn and Subramani [9] point out that knowing a prior what\ninformation will be requested is quite challenging. That is especially true for online communities.\nIn such a context, Post Type II can be useful. These arguments are consistent with the concept of\nconversational knowledge management [30]. Wagner and Bolloju [31] also argue that online\ncommunities carry out knowledge creation and sharing through a process of discussion with\nquestions and answers (discussion forum), collaborative editing and maintenance (Wikipedia), or\nstorytelling (weblogs).\nTherefore, the situation becomes much more complex during the maintenance stage. While online\ncommunities still need Post I and III posts, other types of post (Post Type II, IV and V) are more\ndesired than Post I and III in later stages, and the online communities need to balance these\nactivities carefully. Meanwhile, post type VI is not desired and even prohibited. Here, editorial\ncontent control can screen out these unwelcomed activities [3]. Therefore, even after the online\ncommunities move to the stage of maintenance, these communities are not guaranteed to success\nforever. Without careful monitoring and maintenance, online communities may deteriorate and\nend.\nAlthough lurkers are not desired, we do not mean that individuals should not view and consume\ninformation. In fact, consuming information is one type of participations, and online communities\nwill not remain viable if individuals do not regularly consume the information that contributors\nprovide [4]. However, after individuals consume information, they are desired to give\ncontributors feedback (Post Type IV) or thank contributors (Post Type V). Viewing with posting\n(Post Type N) may not be desired.\nThe discussion above focuses on those participants who are active in online communities in a\ncertain way. Does it mean that there is nothing to do with outsiders, non-interested knowers and\nlurkers? Probably not, and we argue that those three types of individuals can be as interesting as\npartial-contributing participants and contributors. In the next part we provide a few potential\nresearch directions for those types of individuals.\n\n6. IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE STUDIES\nIn this part, we propose a few potential research directions, which we hope can give some insights\nto further online community research. Previous research mainly focuses on the factors to motivate\nindividuals to contribute. In other words, researchers are mainly interested in \"converting\"\nlurkers, non-contributing participants to partial-contributing participants and even contributors.\nWhile we fully agree that this stream of research is quite important for online community\nresearch, we also realize that mainly focusing on contributors may be limited.\nBefore online communities even encourage individuals to actively participate, these individuals\nneed to know the online communities. Therefore, one interesting question can be \"What\ninitiatives can help online communities be known by more individuals?\" After all, potential\n10\n\n\fInternational Journal of Managing Information Technology (IJMIT) Vol.4, No.1, February 2012\n\ncontributors cannot become resource of online communities if they do not even know those\nonline communities.\nMany online communities are interest-based, and their participants generally share similar\ninterests. Therefore, non-interested knowers are probably not interested in the content of that\nonline community4. However, while some online communities organize all content under a shared\ntheme (e.g., all subforums of DIS are related to Disney Park), others may have several loosely\norganized subforums and cover many different areas of content such as sports, movie, and politics\n(e.g., the discussion board in sina.com). In such a context, individuals actively participating in a\nfew subforums may never visit other subforums. Therefore, one interesting question is \"Is it\npossible (or beneficial) to include more subforums and attract more individuals?\" Clearly, adding\nanother subforum can potentially increase the size of participants. However, the cost of\norganizing and maintaining can also go up. Managers of online communities should carefully\nbalance the cost and the benefit when considering such decisions.\nEven if lurkers just consume information without posting, online communities can still impact\nlurkers by influencing their daily life. Therefore, researchers may want to examine lurkers' daily\nlife outside online communities, and divide lurkers into different sub-types, based on the impact\nof online communities. For example, Willett [33] divides lurkers into two kinds: active lurkers\nwho make direct contact with posters or propagate information gained, and passive lurkers who\nonly read for their own use. Based on Willet's study, Takahashi et al. [27] further divide active\nlurkers into two types: active lurkers as propagators, who \"propagates information or knowledge\ngained from an online community to others outside it\", and active lurkers as practitioners who\n\"uses such information or knowledge in their own or organizational activities\". They also classify\npassive lurkers into two types: active lurker candidates and the persistent lurkers based on\n\"whether the online community affects the lurker's thought\". Therefore, one interesting question\nis \"How can online communities impact lurkers' daily behaviours?\"\nRecent studies have begun to understand the effect of online communities on lurkers in the\ncontext of learning. For example, Dennen [6] showed that students learned through reading\nmessages in the online discussion board. This research direction is consistent with knowledge\nmanagement literature. For example Kankanhalli et al. [11] argue that successful knowledge\nmanagement systems need knowledge seekers to use and reuse the codified knowledge. Lindgren\nand Stenmark [15] also argue that individuals can hint their friends about what they think\ninteresting and useful by \"word-of-mouth\" [24]. Therefore, understanding the effect of online\ncommunities on lurkers is quite important.\n\n7. CONCLUSIONS\nOnline community research becomes increasingly popular. In this study, we try to develop\nterminologies to classify participants in online communities. To achieve this goal, we analyze the\nposts from one online community, and then classify participants along a value continuum. We\nthen propose potential directions for future studies. We hope our study can further the research on\nonline communities.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1].\n\nAbrouk, L., Gross-Amblard, D. & Cullot, N.
