We show that the variational inequality V I(C, A) has a unique solution\nfor a relaxed (\u03b3, r)-cocoercive, \u03bc-Lipschitzian mapping A : C \u2192 H with r > \u03b3\u03bc2 ,\nwhere C is a nonempty closed convex subset of a Hilbert space H. From this result,\nit can be derived that, for example, the recent algorithms given in the references\nof this paper, despite their becoming more complicated, are not general as they\nshould be.\nKeywords:\n\nCommon element; Contraction; Fixed point; Iteration; Nonexpansive mapping;\n\nRelaxed (\u03b3, r)-cocoercive mappings; Variational inequality\n\nLet H be a Hilbert space, whose inner product is denoted by h. , .i. Let C be\na nonempty closed convex subset of H and let A : C \u2192 H be a nonlinear map.\nLet PC be the projection of H onto the convex subset C. The classical variational\ninequality which is denoted by V I(C, A) is used to find u \u2208 C such that\nhAu, v \u2212 ui \u2265 0\nfor all v \u2208 C. For a given x \u2208 H, u \u2208 C satisfies the inequality\nhx \u2212 u, u \u2212 yi \u2265 0, \u2200 y \u2208 C,\nif and only if u = PC x. It is known that projection operator PC is nonexpansive.\nIt is easy to see that\nu \u2208 V I(C, A) \u21d0\u21d2 u = PC (u \u2212 \u03bbAu), (1)\nwhere \u03bb > 0 is a constant. This alternative equivalent formulation has played a\nsignificant role in the studies of the variational inequalities and related optimization\nproblems. Recall that:\n(i) A is called r-strongly monotone, if for each x, y \u2208 C we have\nhAx \u2212 Ay, x \u2212 yi \u2265 rkx \u2212 yk2\nfor a constant r > 0.\n(ii) A is called relaxed (\u03b3, r)-cocoercive if there exists two constants \u03b3 > 0 and\nr > 0 such that\nhAx \u2212 Ay, x \u2212 yi \u2265 \u2212\u03b3kAx \u2212 Ayk2 + rkx \u2212 yk2 .\n1\n\n\f2\n\nSHAHRAM SAEIDI\n\nThis class of maps is more general than the class of strongly monotone maps.\nIn [1], Verma considered a relaxed (\u03b3, r)-cocoercive \u03bc-Lipschitz mapping to\npresent approximate solvability of a system of variational inequality problems. In\n[2], the same author proved the following theorem:\nTheorem (Verma [2]). Let C be a nonempty closed convex subset of H and let\nA : C \u2192 H be r-strongly monotone and \u03bc-Lipschitz. Suppose that x\u2217 , y \u2217 \u2208 C be\nchosen such that\n\u001a \u2217\nx = PC (y \u2217 \u2212 \u03c1Ay \u2217 )\nfor \u03c1 > 0,\n(2)\ny \u2217 = PC (x\u2217 \u2212 \u03b7Ax\u2217 )\nfor \u03b7 > 0.\nFor arbitrary chosen initial points x0 , y0 \u2208 C, define {xn } and {yn } as\n\u001a\nxn+1 = (1 \u2212 an )xn + an PC (yn \u2212 \u03c1Ayn )\n(3)\nyn = (1 \u2212 bn )xn + bn PC (xn \u2212 \u03b7Axn )\nP\u221e\nfor all n \u2265 0, where, 0 \u2264 an , bn \u2264 1 and n=0 an bn = \u221e. Then sequences {xn }\nand {yn }, respectively, converge to x\u2217 and y \u2217 for\n2r\n2r\n0 < \u03c1 < 2 and 0 < \u03b7 < 2 .\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nVery recently, Noor [3], Noor and Huang [4-7] and Qin et al. [8] have considered\nsome iterative methods for finding a common element of the set of the fixed points\nof nonexpansive mapping and the set of the solution of a variational inequality\nV I(C, A), where A is a relaxed (\u03b3, r)-cocoercive \u03bc-Lipschitzian mapping of C into\nH such that r > \u03b3\u03bc2 .\nMoreover, Gao and Guo [9] and Qin et al. [10, 11] proposed iterative algorithms\nto find a common element of the set of solutions of variational inequalities for a\nrelaxed (\u03b3, r)-cocoercive \u03bc-Lipschitzian mapping of C into H such that r > \u03b3\u03bc2 ,\nthe set of solutions of an equilibrium problem and also the set of the fixed points\nof nonexpansive mapping.\nBy proving the following proposition we give some important comments on the\nabove mentioned works.\nProposition 1. Let C be a nonempty closed convex subset of H and let A : C \u2192 H\nbe a relaxed (\u03b3, r)-cocoercive, 0 < \u03bc-Lipschitzian mapping such that r > \u03b3\u03bc2 . Then\nV I(C, A) is singleton.\nProof. Let s be a real number such that\n0<s<\n\n2(r \u2212 \u03b3\u03bc2 )\n.\n\u03bc2\n\nThen, for every x, y \u2208 C we have\nkPC (I \u2212 sA)x \u2212 PC (I \u2212 sA)yk2\n\u2264 k(I \u2212 sA)x \u2212 (I \u2212 sA)yk2 = k(x \u2212 y) \u2212 s(Ax \u2212 Ay)k2\n= kx \u2212 yk2 \u2212 2shx \u2212 y, Ax \u2212 Ayi + s2 kAx \u2212 Ayk2\n\u2264 kx \u2212 yk2 \u2212 2s(\u2212\u03b3kAx \u2212 Ayk2 + rkx \u2212 yk2 ) + s2 kAx \u2212 Ayk2\n\u2264 kx \u2212 yk2 + 2s\u03bc2 \u03b3kx \u2212 yk2 \u2212 2srkx \u2212 yk2 + \u03bc2 s2 kx \u2212 yk2\n= (1 + 2s\u03bc2 \u03b3 \u2212 2sr + \u03bc2 s2 )kx \u2212 yk2\n\n\f3\n\n= (1 \u2212 s\u03bc2 [\n\n2(r \u2212 \u03b3\u03bc2 )\n\u2212 s])kx \u2212 yk2 .\n\u03bc2\n\n2\n\n)\n\u2212 s] < 1, the mapping PC (I \u2212 sA) : C \u2192 C is a contracNow, since 1 \u2212 s\u03bc2 [ 2(r\u2212\u03b3\u03bc\n\u03bc2\ntion and Banach' s Contraction Mapping Principle guarantees that it has a unique\nfixed point u; i.e., PC (I \u2212 sA)u = u, which is the unique solution of V I(C, A) by\n(1). \u0003\n\nSince r-strongly monotone mappings are relaxed (\u03b3, r)-cocoercive, we get the\nfollowing.\nProposition 2. Let C be a nonempty closed convex subset of H and let A : C \u2192 H\nbe an 0 < r-strongly monotone and 0 < \u03bc-Lipschitzian mapping. Then V I(C, A)\nis singleton.\nThe followings are our comments:\nComment 1. In Verma' s theorem, mentioned above, A : C \u2192 H is an 0 < rstrongly monotone, 0 < \u03bc-Lipschitzian mapping. Therefore, according to Proposition 2, V I(C, A) is singleton, e.g., V I(C, A) = {u}. Takeing x\u2217 = y \u2217 = u, and\nconsidering (1), the equations in (2) hold and indeed the sequences {xn } and {yn }\nin (3) converge to the unique solution u of V I(C, A). Therefore, x\u2217 , y \u2217 in Verma'\ns theorem are indeed equal the unique solution of V I(C, A); thus the system of\nvariational inequality problems that is considered by Verma in [2] comprises only\none problem.\nComment 2. The iterative methods considered by Noor [3], Noor and Huang\n[4-7] and Qin et al. [8] for finding the common element of the set of the solution of the variational inequality V I(C, A), where A is a relaxed (\u03b3, r)-cocoercive\n\u03bc-Lipschitzian mapping of C into H such that r > \u03b3\u03bc2 , and the set of the fixed\npoints of nonexpansive mapping, can not be really considered as algorithms for\nfinding fixed points of nonexpansive mappings; because, according to Proposition\n1, V I(C, A) is singleton. Therefore, they must be considered as algorithms converging only to the unique solution of V I(C, A).\nComment 3. The iterative algorithms proposed by Gao and Guo [9] and Qin\net al. [10, 11] for finding a common element of the set of solutions of variational\ninequalities for a relaxed (\u03b3, r)-cocoercive \u03bc-Lipschitzian mapping of C into H such\nthat r > \u03b3\u03bc2 , the set of solutions of an equilibrium problem and set of the fixed\npoints of nonexpansive mapping, are not general as they should be and despite their\nbecoming more complicated, they converge only to the unique solution of V I(C, A).\nReferences\n[1] R.
