We create an effective apparatus for features description of nearly perfect fluids in various mediums. As an essentially new\nmodel of an object environment we suppose a quantum heat bath and its\nproperties, including cases of cold and warm vacuums, are studied. We\ndescribe the thermal equilibrium state in place of the traditional density operator in term of a wave function the amplitude and phase of which have\ntemperature dependence.\nWe introduce a new generative operator, Schroedingerian, or stochastic\naction operator, and show its fundamental role in the microdescription. We\ndemonstrate that a new macroparameter, namely the effective action , can\nbe obtained through averaging of the Schroedingerian over the temperature\ndependent wave function. It is established that such different parameters as\ninternal energy, effective temperature, and effective entropy and their fluctuations can be expressed through a single quantity - the effective action.\nPACS numbers: 05.40.-a, 03.75.Hh\n\n1\n\n\f1 Fundamental microtheory: (h\u0304, k)- dynamics\nWe develop a version of the universal theory that is unlike to the particular theory\nproposed earlier for explaining of ratio \"shear viscosity to specific entropy' in\nquark-gluon plasma. We propose to formulate a quantum-thermal dynamics or,\nbriefly, (h\u0304, k)- dynamics (h\u0304kD), as a modification of standard quantum mechanics\ntaking thermal effects into account. The principal distinction of such a theory from\nQSM is that in it the state of a microobject under the conditions of contact with\nthe quantum heat bath (QHB) is generally described not by the density matrix but\nby a temperature-dependent complex wave function.\nWe note that this is not a \"thechnical sleight-of-hand\". Using the wave function, we thereby suppose to consider pure and mixt states simultaneously in the\nframe of Gibbs' ensemble. It is in principle differs from Boltzmann' assembly\nused in QSM.\nA general idea of our investigation: to construct a theory it is necessary\n1. to change \u03c1\u0302 (T ) \u21d2 \u03a8T (q);\n2. to introduce (except of Hamiltonian) a new operator - the stochastic action\n\u02c6\noperator j;\n3. to use an idea of heat bath at T = 0 (\"cold\" heat bath) also;\n4. to use an idea of vacuum at T > 0 (\"thermal\" vacuum) also.\nThis theory is based on a new microparameter, namely, the stochastic action\noperator. In this case, we demonstrate that averaging the corresponding microparameters over the temperature-dependent wave function, we can find the most\nimportant effective macroparameters, including internal energy, temperature, and\nentropy. They have the physical meaning of the standard thermodynamic quantities using in the phenomenological macrodescription.\n\n1.1 The model of the QHB: a case of the \"cold\" vacuum\nTo describe the environment with the holistic stochastic action that was previously\ncalled the thermal field vacuum by Umezawa, we introduce a concrete model, the\nQHB. According to this, the QHB is a set of weakly coupled quantum oscillators\nwith all possible frequencies. The equilibrium thermal radiation can serve as a\npreimage of such a model in nature.\nThe specific feature of our understanding of this model is that we assume that\nwe must apply it to both the \"thermal\" (T 6= 0) and the \"cold\" (T = 0) vacua.\nThus, in the sense of Einstein, we proceed from a more general understanding of\nthe thermal equilibrium, which can, in principle, be established for any type of\n2\n\n\fenvironmental stochastic action (purely quantum, quantum-thermal, and purely\nthermal).\nWe begin our presentation by studying the \"cold\" vacuum and discussing the\ndescription of a single quantum oscillator from the number of oscillators forming\nthe QHB model for T = 0 from a new standpoint.\nBut we recall that the lowest state in the energetic (\u03a8n (q)) and coherent states\n(CS) is the same. In the occupation number representation, the \"cold\" vacuum in\nwhich the number of particles is n = 0 corresponds to this state. In the q representation, the same ground state of the quantum oscillator is in turn described by the\nreal wave function\n\u001a\n\u001b\nq2\n2 \u22121/4\n\u03a80 (q) = [2\u03c0 (\u2206q0 ) ]\nexp \u2212\n.\n(1)\n4(\u2206q0 )2\nAs is well known, CS are the eigenstates of the non-Hermitian particle annihilation operator \u00e2 with complex eigenvalues. But they include one isolated state\n|0a i = |\u03a80 (q)i of the particle vacuum in which eigenvalue of \u00e2 is zero\n\u00e2|0a i = 0|0a i;\n\n\u00e2|\u03a80 (q)i = 0|\u03a80 (q)i.\n\n(2)\n\nIn what follows, it is convenient to describe the QHB in the q representation.\nTherefore, we express the annihilation operator \u00e2 and the creation operator \u00e2\u2020 in\nterms of the operators p\u0302 and q\u0302 using the traditional method. We have\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\np\u0302\nq\u0302 \uf8f8\np\u0302\nq\u0302 \uf8f8\n1\n1\n\u2212 iq\n+ iq\n; \u00e2\u2020 = \uf8ed q\n.\n(3)\n\u00e2 = \uf8ed q\n2\n2\n\u2206p2\n\u2206q2\n\u2206p2\n\u2206q2\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nThe particle number operator then becomes\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\np\u0302\nh\u0304\u03c9 \u02c6 m\u03c9 2 q\u03022\n1 \u02c6 q\u03022\n1\np\u0302\n\u2020\nN\u0302a = \u00e2 \u00e2 =\nI+\n.\n\u2212 I+ 2 =\n\u2212\nh\u0304\u03c9 2m\n2\n2\n\u2206p20 2\n\u2206q0\n\n(4)\n\nThe sum of the first and third terms in the parentheses forms the Hamiltonian\nH of the quantum oscillator, and after multiplying relation (7) by h\u0304\u03c9 on the left\nand on the right, we obtain the standard interrelation between the expressions for\nthe Hamiltonian in the q\u2212 and n\u2212 representations:\n1\u02c6\np\u0302 2 m\u03c9 2 q\u03022\nH\u02c6 =\n+\n= h\u0304\u03c9 (N\u0302a + I),\n2m\n2\n2\n3\n\n(5)\n\n\fwhere I\u02c6 is the unit operator.\nFrom the thermodynamics standpoint, we are concerned with the internal energy of the quantum oscillator in equilibrium with the \"cold\" QHB. Its value is\nequal to the mean of the Hamiltonian calculated over the state |0a i \u2261 |\u03a80 (q)i :\nh\u0304\u03c9\nh\u0304\u03c9\nU0 = h\u03a80 (q)|H\u02c6 |\u03a80 (q)i = h\u0304\u03c9 h\u03a80 (q)|N\u0302a|\u03a80 (q)i +\n=\n= \u03b50 .\n2\n2\n\n(6)\n\nIt follows from formula (9) that in the given case, the state without particles\ncoincides with the state of the Hamiltonian with the minimum energy \u03b50 . The\nquantity \u03b50 , traditionally treated as the energy of zero oscillations, takes the physical meaning of the internal energy U0 of the quantum oscillator in equilibrium\nwith the \"cold\" vacuum.\n\n1.2\n\nPassage to the \"thermal\" vacuum\n\nWe can pass from the \"cold\" to the \"thermal\" vacuum in the spirit of Umezawa\nusing the Bogoliubov (u, v)\u2212 transformation with the temperature-dependent coefficients\n\nu=\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nh\u0304\u03c9\n1\ncoth\n+\n2\n2kB T 2\n\n\u00131/2\n\n\u03c0\nei 4 ; v =\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nh\u0304\u03c9\n1\ncoth\n\u2212\n2\n2kB T 2\n\n\u00131/2\n\n\u03c0\n\ne\u2212i 4 .\n\n(7)\n\nIn the given case, this transformation is canonical but leads to a unitarily\nnonequivalent representation because the QHB at any temperature is a system\nwith an infinitely number of freedom degrees.\nIn the end, such a transformation reduces to passing from the set of quantum\noscillator CS to a more general set of states called the thermal correlated coherent states (TCCS). They are selected because they ensure that the Schrodinger\ncoordinate-momentum uncertainty relation is saturated at any temperature. From\nthe of the second-quantization apparatus standpoint, the Bogoliubov (u, v)\u2212 transformation ensures the passage from the original system of particles with the \"cold\"\nvacuum |0a i to the system of quasiparticles described by the annihilation operator\nb\u0302 and the creation operator b\u0302\u2020 with the \"thermal\" vacuum |0b i.\nTo obtain from \"cold\" vacuum to \"thermal\" one using (u, v) - Bogolubov's\ntransformations it is necessary to pass:\n1. from CS to TCCS: \u03a80 (q) \u21d2 \u03a8T (q); |0a i \u21d2 ||0b i; 2. from particles to\nquasiparticles: \u00e2 \u21d2 b\u0302 = b\u0302(T ).\n4\n\n\fIn this case, the choice of transformation coefficients (10) is fixed by the requirement that for any method of description, the expression for the mean energy\nof the quantum oscillator in thermal equilibrium be defined by the Planck formula,\nwhich can be obtained from experiments:\nEPl. = h\u0304\u03c9 (exp\n\nh\u0304\u03c9\nh\u0304\u03c9\nh\u0304\u03c9\nh\u0304\u03c9\n\u2212 1)\u22121 +\n=\ncoth\n.\nkB T\n2\n2\n2kB T\n\n(8)\n\nEarlier was shown by us, the state of the \"thermal\" vacuum |0b i \u2261 |\u03a8T (q)i in\nthe q\u2212 representation corresponds to the complex wave function\n\u001a\n\u001b\nq2\n2 \u22121/4\n(1 \u2212 i\u03b1 ) ,\nexp \u2212\n(9)\n\u03a8T (q) = [2\u03c0 (\u2206q) ]\n4(\u2206q)2\nwhere\n\u0015\n\u0014\nh\u0304m\u03c9\nh\u0304\u03c9\nh\u0304\u03c9\nh\u0304\u03c9 \u22121\nh\u0304\n; (\u2206p)2 =\n; \u03b1 = sinh\ncoth\n.\ncoth\n(\u2206q) =\n2m\u03c9\n2kB T\n2kB T\n2\n2kB T\n(10)\nWe note that the expressions for the probability densities \u03c1T (q) and \u03c1T (p) have\nalready been obtained by Bloch, but the expressions for the phase that depend on\nthe parameter \u03b1 play a very significant role and were not previously known. It is\nalso easy to see that as T \u2192 0, the parameter \u03b1 \u2192 0 and the function \u03a8T (q) from\nthe set of TCCS passes to the function \u03a80 (q) from the set of CS.\nOf course, the states from the set of TCCS are the eigenstates of the nonHermitian quasiparticle annihilation operator b\u0302 with complex eigenvalues. They\nalso include one isolated state of the quasiparticle vacuum in which eigenvalue of\nb\u0302 is zero,\n2\n\nb\u0302|0b i = 0|0bi; b\u0302|\u03a8T (q)i = 0|\u03a8T (q)i.\n\n(11)\n\nUsing condition (15) and expression (12) for the wave function of the \"thermal\" vacuum, we obtain the expression for the operator b\u0302 in the q\u2212 representation:\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nr\n1\nh\u0304\u03c9 \u22121\nq\u0302\nh\u0304\u03c9 \uf8f0 p\u0302\nq\nb\u0302 =\n\u2212 iq\n(coth\n) (1 \u2212 i\u03b1 )\uf8fb .\ncoth\n(12)\n2\n2kB T\n2k\nT\n2\n2\nB\n\u2206p\n\u2206q\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n\fThe corresponding quasiparticle creation operator has the form\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nr\n1\nh\u0304\u03c9 \uf8f0 p\u0302\nh\u0304\u03c9 \u22121\nq\u0302\nq\n) (1 + i\u03b1 )\uf8fb .\nb\u0302\u2020 =\ncoth\n+ iq\n(coth\n2\n2kB T\n2k\nT\n2\n2\nB\n\u2206p\n\u2206q\n0\n\n(13)\n\n0\n\nWe can verify that as T \u2192 0 , the operators b\u0302\u2020 and b\u0302 for quasiparticles pass to\nthe operators a\u2020 and \u00e2 for particles and |0b i \u21d2 |0ai; \u03a8T (q) \u21d2 \u03a80 (q).\nActing just as above, we obtain the expression for the quasiparticle number\noperator in the q\u2212 representation\n\u0014 2\n\u0015\n1\nq\u03022\np\u0302\nh\u0304\u03c9\nh\u0304\u03c9 \u22121 \u02c6 \u03b1\nN\u0302b = b\u0302 b\u0302 = coth\n\u2212 2(coth\n) (I + { p\u0302, q\u0302}) + 2 , (14)\nh\u0304\n4\n2kB T \u2206p20\n2kB T\n\u2206q0\n\u2020\n\nwhere we take 1 + \u03b1 2 = coth2 2kh\u0304B\u03c9T into account when calculating the last term.\n\n1.3\n\nHamiltonian in TCCS\n\nPassing from the quasiparticle number operator to the original Hamiltonian and\nmultiplying by h\u0304\u03c9 , we obtain\n\u0015\n\u0014\nh\u0304\n\u03c9\n\u03b1\n1\n\u22121\n(15)\nH\u02c6 = h\u0304\u03c9 (coth\nN\u0302b + (I\u02c6 + { p\u0302, q\u0302}) .\n)\nh\u0304\n2kB T\n2\n\nWe stress that the operator { p\u0302, q\u0302} in formula (19) can also be expressed in\nterms of bilinear combinations of the operators b\u0302\u2020 and b\u0302, but they differ from the\nquasiparticle number operator Nb . This means that the operators H\u02c6 and N\u0302b do\nnot commute and that the wave function of form (12) characterizing the state of\nthe \"thermal\" vacuum is therefore not the eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian.\nAs before, we are interested in the thermodynamic quantity, namely, the internal energy U of the quantum oscillator now in thermal equilibrium with the\n\"thermal\" QHB. Calculating it just as earlier, we obtain\n\u0014\n\u0015\nh\u0304\u03c9 \u22121\n1 \u03b1\nU = h\u0304\u03c9 (coth\nh\u03a8T (q)|N\u0302b|\u03a8T (q)i + + h\u03a8T (q)|{ p\u0302, q\u0302}|\u03a8T (q)i\n)\n2kB T\n2 2h\u0304\n(16)\nin the q\u2212 representation. Because we averaging over the quasiparticle vacuum in\nformula (20), the first term in it vanishes. At the same time, it was shown earlier\nby us that\n6\n\n\fh\u03a8T (q)|{ p\u0302, q\u0302}|\u03a8T (q)i = h\u0304\u03b1 .\nAs a result, we obtain the expression for the internal energy of the quantum\noscillator in the \"thermal\" QHB in the h\u0304kD:\nU=\n\nh\u0304\u03c9\nh\u0304\u03c9\nh\u0304\u03c9\n(1 + \u03b1 2 ) =\ncoth\n= EPl. ,\nh\u0304\u03c9\n2\n2kB T\n2(coth 2kB T )\n\n(17)\n\nwhere EPl. is defined by Planck formula (11). This means that the average energy\nof the quantum oscillator at T 6= 0 has the thermodynamic meaning of its internal\nenergy in the case of equilibrium with the \"thermal\" QHB. As T \u2192 0, it passes to\na similar quantity corresponding to equilibrium with the \"cold\" QHB.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nNew fundamental operator - Schroedingerian\nSchroedinger uncertainties relation\n\nBecause the original statement of the h\u0304kD is the idea of the holistic stochastic\naction of the QHB on the object, we introduce a new operator in the Hilbert space\nof microstates to implement it.\nWe recall the general expression of Schwartz inequality |A|2 * |B|2 > |A * B|2.\nSaturated Schroedinger uncertainties relations (SUR) coordinate-momentum\nfollowing from it is:\nh\u03042\n.\n(18)\n4\nIn the absent of stochastic action R\u0303qp \u2261 0.

On one hand, it is the amplitude of the transition from the\nstate |\u2206qi to the state |\u2206pi; on the other hand, it can be treated as the Schroedinger\nquantum correlator calculated over an arbitrary state | i of some operator.\n7\n\n\fAs is well known, the nonzero value of quantity (24) is the fundamental attribute of nonclassical theory in which the environmental stochastic action on an\nobject plays a significant role. Therefore, it is quite natural to assume that the averaged operator in formula (24) has a fundamental meaning. In view of dimensional\nconsiderations, we call it the stochastic action operator or Schroedingerian,\nb\nj \u2261 \u2206 pb\u2206b\nq.\n\n(20)\n\nOf course, it should be remembered that the operators \u2206q\u0302 and \u2206 p\u0302 do not commute and their product is a non-Hermitian operator.\nTo analyze further, following Schroedinger, we can write the given operator\n1\n1\nb\nb \u2212 i bj0.\nj = {\u2206 pb\u2206b\nq + \u2206b\nq\u2206 pb} + [\u2206 pb\u2206b\nq \u2212 \u2206b\nq\u2206 pb] = \u03c3\n(21)\n2\n2\nIt allows separating the Hermitian part of j\u02c6 from the anti-Hermitian one. Then the\nHermitian operators \u03c3b and j\u02c60 have the form\n\nh\u0304 \u02c6\ni\n1\n(22)\n\u03c3b \u2261 {\u2206 p\u0302, \u2206q\u0302}; j\u02c60 \u2261 [ p\u0302 , q\u0302 ] = I.\n2\n2\n2\nb | i of the operator \u03c3\u0302 resembles the exIt is easy to see that the mean \u03c3 = h |\u03c3\npression for the standard correlator of coordinate and momentum fluctuations in\nclassical probability theory. It transforms into this expression if the operators \u2206q\u0302\nand \u2206 p\u0302 are replaced with c-numbers. It reflects the contribution to the transition\namplitude R\u0303 pq of the environmental stochastic action. Therefore, we call the operator \u03c3\u0302 the external action operator in what follows.\nAt the same time, the operators j\u02c60 and j\u02c6 were not previously introduced. The\noperator j\u02c60 of form (27) reflects a specific peculiarity of the objects to be \"sensitive\" to the minimum stochastic action of the \"cold\" vacuum and to respond to it\nadequately regardless of their states. Therefore, it should be treated as a minimum\nstochastic action operator. Its mean J0 = 2h\u0304 is independent of the choice of the\nstate over which the averaging is performed, and it hence has the meaning of the\ninvariant eigenvalue of the operator j\u02c60 .\n\n8\n\n\f3\n\nEffective action as a fundamental generative macroparameter\n\n3.1 The mean of the operator b\nj\n\nWe now construct the macrodescription of objects using their microdescription in\nthe h\u0304kD. It is easy to see that the mean J \u0303 of the operator j\u02c6 of form (26) coincides\nwith the complex transition amplitude Repq or Schroedinger's correlator and, in\nthermal equilibrium, can be expressed as\nJ \u0303 = h\u03a8T (q)| bj |\u03a8T (q)i = \u03c3 \u2212 i J0 ,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere \u03c3 and J0 are the means of the corresponding operators.

Using the dimensionless expressions for\n\u03c1 (q) = |\u03a8(q)|2 and \u03c1 (p) = |\u03a8(p)|2, we propose to define a formal coordinate momentum entropy Sqp by the equality\n\u001aZ\n\u001b\nZ\nSqp = \u2212kB\n\u03c1\u0303 (q\u0303) ln \u03c1\u0303 (q\u0303)d q\u0303 + \u03c1\u0303 ( p\u0303) ln \u03c1\u0303 ( p\u0303)d p\u0303 .\n(26)\nSubstituting the corresponding expressions for \u03c1\u0303 (q\u0303) and \u03c1\u0303 ( p\u0303) in (41), we obtain\n\u001a\n\u001b\n2\u03c0\nh\u0304\u03c9\nSqp = kB (1 + ln ) + ln coth\n.\n(27)\n\u03b4\n2kB T\n9\n\n\fObviously, the final result depends on the choice of the constant \u03b4 .\nChoosing \u03b4 = 2\u03c0 , we can interpret expression (42) as the quantum-thermal\nentropy or, briefly, the QT \u2212 entropy SQT because it coincides exactly with the\neffective entropy Se f . obtained earlier by us in the macrotheory framework.\n\u001a\n\u001b\nJe f .\nSQT \u2261 Se f . = kB 1 + ln\n= kB {1 + ln \u03a9} ,\n(28)\nJ0\n\nwhere \u03a9 according to Boltzmann is a number of microstates in the given macrostate.\nThis ensures the consistency between the main results of our proposed micro- and\nmacrodescriptions and their correspondence to experiments.\n\n3.3\n\nQuantum Statistical Thermodynamics on the base of the\neffective action\n\nThe above presentation shows that using the h\u0304kD developed here, we can introduce the effective action Je f . as a new fundamental macroparameter. The advantage of this quantity is that it has a microscopic preimage, namely, the stochastic action operator j,\u02c6 or Schroedingerian, which has an obvious physical sense.\nMoreover, we can in principle express the main thermodynamic characteristics of\nobjects in thermal equilibrium in terms of it. As is well known, temperature and\nentropy are the most fundamental of them.\nIf the notion of effective action is used, these heuristic considerations can acquire an obvious meaning. For this, we turn to expression (34) for Te f . \u223c Je f . .\nIt follows from it that the effective action is also an intensive macroparameter\ncharacterizing the stochastic action of the \"thermal\" QHB.\nIn view of this, the Zero Law of equilibrium quantum Statistical Thermodynamics can be rewritten as\nJe f . = Jetherm.\n\u00b1 \u2206Je f . ,\nf.\n\n(29)\n\nwhere Jeterm.\nf . is effective action of QHB, Je f . and \u2206Je f . are the means of the effective action of an object and the standard deviation from it. The state of thermal\nequilibrium can actually be described in the sense of Newton, assuming that \"the\nstochastic action is equal to the stochastic counteraction\" in such cases.\n\n10\n\n\f4\n\nConnection with experiment\n\nNowadays there is alot of papers on the theory of nearly perfect fluids where the\nratio of shift viscosity to entropy volume density is the subject of interest. It was\nshown by us that this quantity can be given by\nef.\n\nef.\n\nJ\ncoth Tmin /T\nJe f .\ncoth \u03ba \u03c9 /T\n= min\n\u2192 \u03ba.\n*\n=\u03ba *\ne\nf\n.\ne\nf\n.\ne\nf\n.\nS\n1 + ln coth \u03ba \u03c9 /T\nSmin 1 + ln coth Tmin /T\n\n(30)\n\nIn this expression,\n\u03ba\u2261\n\nef.\nJmin\nef.\nSmin\n\n=\n\nh\u0304\n= 3, 82 * 10\u221212K c.\n2kB\n\n(31)\n\nis the limiting ratio for T \u226a T e f . .\nIn our opinion, the quality is not only the notation for one of the possible\ncombinations of the world constants h\u0304 and kB . It also has its intrinsic physical\nmeaning. We sure that the quantity \u03ba plays the role of a constant essentially\ncharacterizing the holistic stochastic action on the object.\nThe analogical with (51) relation in QSM, in contrast to one in h\u0304kD, has the\nform\nJ\nT\nh\u0304 exp(\u2212h\u0304\u03c9 /kB T )\n(32)\n\u2192\n= \u2192 0.\nS\nkB (h\u0304\u03c9 /kB T ) exp(\u2212h\u0304\u03c9 /kB T ) \u03c9\nTherefore it is now possible to compare two theories (h\u0304kD and QSM) experimentally by measuring the limiting value of this ratio.\nThe first indication that the quantity \u03ba plays an important role was obtained in\nAndronikashvili's experiments (1948) on the viscosity of liquid Helium below the\n\u03bb \u2212 point. There are also another areas of Physics where the constant \u03ba appears.\nNow the constant \u03ba is also observed in cold atomic gases and different solids,\nincluding graphene, as a characteristic of the fundamentally new state of matter nearly perfect fluids (Shaefer, Teaney, 2009). We hope that h\u0304kD can serve as an\ninitial microtheory for constructing of modified thermodynamics fit for very small\nobjects at ultra-low temperatures.\nThis work was supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (project\nNo. 10-01-90408)\n\n11\n\n\fReferences\n[1] A.D.
