Here, some open problems\ninclude understanding (a) the observed activated temperature dependence at the resistance minima, (b) the role\nof the potential landscape in influencing the magnitude\nof the observed oscillatory effect, and (c) the nature of\nthe overlap with quantum Hall effect.[23]\nA further topic of interest is to examine, in detail, the\ngrowth of the oscillatory effect vs. the radiation intensity,\n\nP . So far as theoretical results regarding this aspect are\nconcerned, a number of works have numerically evaluated\nthe radiation-induced magnetoresistance oscillations for\nseveral P and graphically presented the results.[24, 31,\n33] In contrast, Dmitriev and co-workers,[30] have made\nthe prediction that, in the linear response regime, the\ncorrection to the dark dc conductivity is linear in P , see\neqn. 16, ref. [30].\nA comparison of experiment with theory, so far as the\nP -dependence is concerned, could help to identify the\nrelative importance of the invoked-mechanisms in the\nabove mentioned theories. Further, the novel proposal\nthat these radiation-induced phenomena could constitute a new example of complex emergence, where selforganization can arise from a number of basic interactions\nwith remarkable collective aspects,[34] has also identified\nthe need to better understand the P dependence. Finally, as a related issue, it is also of interest to compare the growth of the radiation-induced resistance oscillations with P in materials prepared in different laboratories in order to determine whether wafer preparation practices, which influence the scattering landscape\nwithin the electronic system and impact the lifetimes /\nobserved characteristics, lead to a perceptible difference\nin the measurements.\nThus, we examine the growth of the radiation-induced\nmagneto-resistance oscillations with P in GaAs/AlGaAs\ndevices. We also compare the radiation-induced transport in devices fabricated from MBE material grown\nby Wegscheider (W), with results from similar material prepared by Umansky (U). We find that the\nradiation-induced oscillatory diagonal resistance, \u2206Rxx ,\nin both materials can be described by \u2206Rxx =\n\u2212Aexp(\u2212\u03bb/B)sin(2\u03c0F/B), where A is the amplitude,\n\u03bb is the damping parameter, and F is the f -dependent\n\n\f2\n12\n\n46 GHz\n1.5K\n\nW1\n\n(a)\n8\n\n0.4 mm\n\nRxx (:)\n\nmagneto-resistance oscillation frequency.

Such growth of A with\nP and T has not been predicted.\n\nw/ radiation\n\nEXPERIMENT\n4\n\nRESULTS\n\nFigure 1(a) exhibits the data for a 0.4mm wide Hall bar\n(W1) fabricated from the W-material. The figure shows\nthe Rxx = Vxx /I measured both in the dark (w/o radiation) and under 46GHz photo-excitation (w/ radiation).\nAlso shown are B calibration markers obtained from the\nESR of DPPH at fESR = 5GHz. The figure shows large\namplitude radiation-induced magneto-resistance oscillations, as the Rxx is reduced to roughly 10% of the dark\nvalue at deepest resistance minimum.

Microwaves were conveyed via the waveguide, and the intensity was set at the source, as indicated. Hardware between source and sample introduces\nintensity attenuation. A standing wave pattern also\nproduces an axial intensity variation within the waveguide, with a possible further intensity reduction at the\nsample. Since the B-field readout of a superconducting magnet power supply is not always reliable at low\nB, the B-field could be characterized in-situ by performing Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) of DiPhenylPicryl-Hydrazal (DPPH). The DPPH-ESR identifies B\nvia the relation BESR = fESR /[28.043GHz/T ].[8] The\nW-GaAs/AlGaAs single heterostructures were nominally\ncharacterized by an electron density, n = 2.4 \u00d7 1011cm\u22122\nand a mobility of \u03bc = 107 cm2 /V s. The U-material\nwas roughly comparable, albeit with a slightly higher\nn, n = 3 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22122 . The 2DES's were prepared, as\nis usual, using the Persistent Photo-Conductivity (PPC)\neffect, with a brief illumination by a LED. Since the realized low-temperature \u03bc and n depends upon the cooldown and illumination procedure via the PPC effect,\na given specimen can show associated preparation dependent changes in the radiation-induced characteristics.\nResults are reported here for two sets of measurements,\nlabeled U1 and U2, on a U-specimen, and measurements,\nlabeled W1, W2, and W3 on a set of three W-specimens.\n\n46 GHz\n\n2\n\n4\n\n1\n\n1/4\n\n0\n\nk0 = 0.22\nF = 0.1065 T\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nF/B\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Inset: A sketch of the Hall bar sample. The main\npanel exhibits Rxx obtained in the dark (w/o radiation) and\nunder photoexcitation (w/radiation), both on the left (blue\ntraces) and right (red traces) sides of the device W1. B-field\nmarkers based on ESR of DPPH at fESR = 5GHz occur at\n\u00b10.178T . (b) Rxx , shown on the right ordinate, has been\nplotted vs. B \u22121 in order to exhibit the B \u22121 periodicity of the\noscillations. The oscillatory maxima (minima) have been assigned with integers (half-integers), see the left ordinate. The\nplot of k (left ordinate) vs. B \u22121 has been subjected to a linear\nfit (orange curve), i.e., k = k0 + F B \u22121 . Here, k0 represents\nthe phase, and F is the frequency of the radiation-induced\nmagneto-resistance oscillations. Thus, the plot confirms a\n\"1/4-cycle\" phase shift in the W-specimen. The abscissa has\nbeen scaled to F/B.\n\nat the nodes of the oscillations.[4, 24] Similar results are\nobtained on both the left- and right- sides of the device. The small asymmetry observed under B-reversal\nis attributed to an admixture between the diagonal and\noff-diagonal (Hall) signals.\nIn Fig. 1(b), Rxx on the right ordinate has been plotted vs. B \u22121 in order to exhibit the B \u22121 periodicity of\nthe oscillations. The oscillatory maxima (minima) were\nthen assigned with integers (half-integers), see the left\nordinate, beginning with k = 1 for the Rxx maximum at\nthe lowest F/B. The plot of k (left ordinate) vs. B \u22121\nhas been subjected to a linear fit, i.e., k = k0 + F B \u22121 ,\nwhich is represented by the orange curve in Fig. 1(b).\nHere, k0 represents the phase, and F is the frequency\nof the radiation-induced magneto-resistance oscillations.\nThus, the fit extracted k0 = 0.22, see Fig. 1(b), confirms\n\n\f3\n\n2.5 GHz\n\n50 GHz\n0.5 K\n\nDPPH ESR\n\n(d)\n\n(a)\n\nU1\n-5 dBm\n\ndata\nfit\n\n2\u0003:\n\n1.5 K\n\n(c)\n\n3.2 mW\n\nRxx\n\n'Rxx\n\nW1\ndata\nfit\n\n-10 dBm\n\n0.00 mW\n\n\u01fbRxxFit = -Aexp(-\u021c/B)sin(2\u028cF/B)\ndata\nfit\n\n-15 dBm\n\n50 GHz\n2\n\n3.21 GHz\n\nDPPH ESR\n\n-1\n\n0.5 K\n\n0.32 mW\n\n0.25\n0.20\n0.15\n0.0\n\nU1\n\n(a)\n\nA (:)\n\nRxx\nIFP\n8.6\n\nIFP\n17.2\n-1\n-1\nB (T)\n\n50 GHz\n25.8\n\n5\n\nU1\nU2\n0.1\n\n0.2\nP(mW)\n\n(b)\n0.3\n\n40\n30\n\n0.00 mW\n\n4\nF/B\n\nO\u0003 7\n\n(b)\n\n8.736 T\n\n3\n\n1.605 GHz\n\n(c)\n\nU2 Fit: A = 116(P)0.50\n\n20\n10\n0\n0.0\n\n0.49\nU1 Fit: A = 66(P)\n0.1\n\n0.2\nP (mW)\n\n0.3\n\nFIG. 2: (a) The 50GHz photo-excited and dark Rxx has been\nplotted vs. B \u22121 for U1.

Figure 2(a)\nand (b) correspond to the experiment on the U-specimen\nat 0.5K, while Fig. 2(c) and (d) correspond to the W1 experiment at T = 1.5K. Here, the DPPH-ESR B-markers\nshown in Fig. 2(b) and 2(d) served to calibrate B for the\ncorresponding experiments. Fig. 2(a) and (c) show that\nboth specimens exhibit Integer Fixed Points (IFP) at the\nsame B \u22121 . IFP's are points where the dark Rxx trace intersects the photo-excited Rxx trace. IFP's occur in the\nvicinity of hf = nh\u0304\u03c9c , where \u03c9c equals the cyclotron\nfrequency, and n = 1, 2, 3....[24] If two material systems\nare similar, then one expects the IFP's to occur at the\nsame B \u22121 at constant f , and this is what is observed in\nthe data. Thus, for example, the relative diffusion of Al\ninto the GaAs 2DES seems no different in the two sys-\n\ntems, since greater diffusion in one system than the other\nwould lead to observable differences in m\u2217 /m and thus\nthe IFP's.\nTo examine the growth of the radiation-induced oscillations with P , Fig. 3 presents the \u2206Rxx of U1 for\nseveral P at 50GHz. Also shown in the figure are fits\nf it\nto the data using \u2206Rxx\n= \u2212Aexp(\u2212\u03bb/B)sin(2\u03c0F/B).\nHere, a slowly varying background, approximately equaling the dark trace, was removed from the photo-excited\nRxx data to realize \u2206Rxx . Although this fit function\nincludes three parameters, A, \u03bb, and F , the oscillation\nperiod in B \u22121 is independent of the radiation-intensity,\nand thus, F is a constant. Further, the damping constant, \u03bb,[9] turns out to be insensitive to P , as is evident\nin Fig. 3(b), which shows \u03bb vs. P for U1 and U2. The\nsmall difference in \u03bb obtained for U1 and U2 in different\ncool-downs is attributed to the PPC-effect dependence\nof the electronic properties in the GaAs/AlGaAs system.\nThus, the main free parameter in the fit-function is the\namplitude, A, of the oscillations. In Fig. 3(c), we exhibit the fit extracted A vs. P for U1 and U2.

Also shown are\npower law fits, A = A0 P \u03b1 . Here, \u03b1 = 0.49 and \u03b1 = 0.50\nfor U1 and U2, respectively. A0 varies between U1 and\nU2 because the effective intensity attenuation factor is\ndifferent in the two experiments.\nFig. 4(a) shows power-dependent \u2206Rxx vs F/B at\n50GHz for W1, along with lineshape fits. As above, F\nwas insensitive to P , and the F of W1 agreed with the F\nof U1, see Fig. 2, and also U2. Fig. 4(b) exhibits \u03bb vs.\nP for W1 and W2. Again, \u03bb is insensitive P . Note that\n\u03bbW \u2248 0.15T < 0.2T \u2248 \u03bbU . If the damping is written as\nexp(\u2212\u03bb/B) = exp(\u2212\u03c0/\u03c9c \u03c4f ) \u2248 exp(\u2212pTf /B), where Tf\nand \u03c4f represent finite frequency broadening temperature\nand lifetime, respectively,[9] then the \u03bb imply that Tf,U \u2248\n200mK and Tf,W \u2248 150mK. Thus, Tf,U > Tf,W , i.e.,\nthere is more broadening in the U-specimen. Next, in\nFig. 4(c), we exhibit the fit extracted A vs. P for W1 and\nW2. The figure suggests a nonlinear growth of A with P .\nAlso shown are the fits, A = A0 P \u03b1 , which suggest that\n\u03b1 = 0.63 and \u03b1 = 0.64 for W1 and W2, respectively.\nFor a third W-specimen labeled W3, Fig. 5 reports the\ninfluence of the temperature on the growth of A vs. P ,\n\n0\n0.0\n\nFit: A = A0P\n0.2\n\nD\n\n0.4\nP (mW)\n\n0.6\n\nFIG. 5: (a) At f = 50GHz, the amplitude, A, is plotted\nvs. P for T = 1.4K, 1.8Kand2.2K for specimen W3. Also\nshown are fits to A = A0 P \u03b1 . The fit-extracted \u03b1 and A0\nare presented are presented in tabular form within the figure.\nThe inset shows the variation of \u03b1 with T at 50GHz. (b)\nAt f = 46GHz, the amplitude, A, is plotted vs. P for T =\n1.4K, 1.75Kand2.6K for specimen W3. Also shown are fits\nto A = A0 P \u03b1 . The fit-extracted \u03b1 and A0 are presented are\npresented in tabular form within the figure. The inset shows\nthe variation of \u03b1 with T at 46GHz.\n\nwhere A is extracted, as before, from line-shape fits of the\nf it\noscillatory data to \u2206Rxx\n= \u2212Aexp(\u2212\u03bb/B)sin(2\u03c0F/B).\nParenthetically, we note here that such fits suggested a\ngeneral insensitivity of \u03bb to the experimental parameters\nf , T , and P . Indeed, \u03bb = 0.144 \u00b1 0.005 served to fit all\nthe f , T , and P covered in Fig. 5.\nFig. 5(a) and 5(b) indicate that, as expected, at a constant P , A grows with decreasing T both at f = 50GHz\n[Fig. 5(a)] and f = 46GHz [Fig 5(b)]. Further, the\nfigures show that the A vs. P curves exhibit greater curvature at lower temperatures. The A vs. P have been fit\nonce again to A = A0 P \u03b1 in order to quantify the observations; the fit-extracted \u03b1 and A0 have been summarized\nin tabular form within Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 5(b). These fitextracted \u03b1 have also been plotted vs. T in the inset to\nthese figures. These insets suggest that \u03b1 decreases with\ndecreasing temperatures, consistent with the observed in-\n\n\f5\nresults presented here suggest a nonlinear power law increase in a regime characterized by modest excitation.\n\n1.4 K\n\n1.6\n\nW3\n1.75 K\n\nLog10 (A)\n\n1.2\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n0.8\n\n2.6 K\n\n0.4\n\n46 GHz\n0.0\n-1.6\n\n-1.2\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.4\n\n0.0\n\n0.4\n\nLog10 (P(mW))\n\nFIG. 6: This figure present a Log-Log plot of the amplitude A\nof the exponentially-damped-sine-wave-fit (see text) vs. the\nradiation-intensity P at 46GHz for specimen W3. At the\nhighest radiation intensities, the amplitude saturates and then\ndecreases with increasing P .\n\ncreased non-linearity at lower temperatures. Using this\nresult, one might attribute, at least in part, the smaller\n\u03b1 in the U-specimens, see Fig. 3(c), in comparison to\nthe W-specimens W1 and W2, see Fig. 4(c), to the lower\ntemperature in the U-measurements.\nNote that, at f = 50GHz, all three W-specimens,\nwith comparable material properties, exhibit the same\n\u03b1, within uncertainties, at the lowest pumped 4 He temperatures, cf. Fig. 4(c) and Fig. 5(a). In addition, a\ncomparison of the \u03b1 reported in Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 5(b)\nalso suggests that reducing the microwave frequency f at\na fixed T tends to reduce the \u03b1, i.e., increase the nonlinearity.\nThe nonlinear power law intensity variation reported\nhere is associated with modest excitation. It is known\nthat the amplitude of the radiation-induced magnetoresistance oscillations saturates at higher P , and further,\nthere is a \"breakdown\" and a decrease in the amplitude\nat the highest P .[13] The results shown thus far in Fig.\n1 - Fig. 5 do not correspond to such high P .\nTo illustrate the behavior in the higher P regime, we\nexhibit in Fig. 6, the A vs. P at f = 46GHz, when efficient coupling has been realized between the microwave\nsource and the specimen, i.e, when the sample has been\nlocated at the intensity peak in the standing wave pattern realized within the waveguide sample-holder. The\nlog10 \u2212 log10 plot exhibited in Fig. 6 shows A saturation, and subsequent A decrease with increasing P , at\nthe highest P , consistent with our previous report.[13]\nAs mentioned, most theories have exhibited numerically evaluated Rxx or \u03c1xx including radiation-induced\noscillations at several P ,[24, 31, 33], while Dmitriev et\nal,[30] have predicted that the amplitude of the radiationinduced oscillations should increase linearly with P . The\n\nIn summary, consistent experimental results have been\nobtained for the U- and W- material so far as the essential\nfeatures of the radiation-induced magnetoresistance oscillations are concerned, and this includes the \"1/4-cycle\"\nphase shift.[8] In addition, nonlinear growth is observed\nin the amplitude of radiation-induced magneto-resistance\noscillations with P in both materials. Although fits have\nbeen utilized here to quantify the non-linear intensity dependence, such fits are not necessary to perceive the basic\nnon-linear intensity dependence in the raw data.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nR.G.M. is supported by the Army Research Office\nunder W911NF-07-01-0158 and the DOE under DESC0001762.\n\n[1] M.
