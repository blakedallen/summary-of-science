Early\ndirect extensions of the Chapman-Enskog method to inelastic systems have\nbeen refined recently so that the transport coefficients for the Boltzmann\ngas are now known accurately [5,8]. These refinements have clarified the role\nof the time dependent reference state, the local homogeneous cooling state\n(HCS), and its effects on the qualitative and quantitative characterization of\nthe conditions for the validity of a hydrodynamic description. The extension\nof these results to higher densities also has been accomplished in the context\nof the phenomenological Boltzmann-Enskog equation [6]. However, more general conclusions regarding transport in dense granular fluids are quite limited.\nOn the other hand, for elastic collisions the analysis of transport in fluids is\nquite sophisticated using, for instance, methods of linear response theory [9].\nSuch methods provide formally exact expressions for transport properties in\nterms of time dependent fluctuations in the equilibrium reference state. These\nrepresentations have proven to be particularly useful due to the possibility\nof their direct evaluation by molecular dynamics simulation. In this context,\n\n\f2\n\nJ. Javier Brey et al.\n\nit is natural to ask to what extent the methods of linear response theory can\nbe applied to granular fluids.\nIn applications of linear response for fluids with elastic collisions, the local conserved densities of mass, energy, and momentum play a special role.\nThey represent the slow variables as the system approaches uniformity. More\nsignificantly, they are the hydrodynamic modes in the long wavelength limit,\ni.e the formal eigenfunctions of the Liouville operator corresponding to the\nhydrodynamic eigenvalues. Standard linear response methods consider perturbations of the homogeneous state (the Gibbs ensemble) that are linear\ncombinations of the conserved densities. In this way, hydrodynamic excitations are selected and, by formal manipulation of the response functions,\nGreen-Kubo expressions for the transport coefficients are derived directly. A\nquite reasonable extension of this method to granular systems, using linear\ncombinations of the local conserved densities as initial perturbations, has\nbeen described in Ref.[10]. The resulting Green-Kubo expressions are similar to those for systems with elastic collisions, but they do not agree at low\ndensity with those from the Chapman-Enskog method noted above. This difference has been made more precise by reformulating the Chapman-Enskog\nresults in a Green-Kubo representation [11]. The resulting time correlation\nfunctions are not simply those for the fluxes of the conserved densities, as it\nis the case for elastic collisions. The reason is that the hydrodynamic modes\nfor granular systems are no longer simply related to the conserved densities,\neven in the long wavelength limit. Instead, the hydrodynamic modes and conserved densities are conjugate sets in the sense that the former generate the\nhydrodynamic excitation while the latter measure the response. An objective\nhere is to clarify this subtle difference in the context of the linearized Boltzmann equation for inelastic hard particles, and to discuss the consequences\nfor more general applications.\nClearly, an important first issue is the unambiguous definition of hydrodynamic modes. This is accomplished by considering the eigenvalue problem for\nthe operator generating the dynamics for the Boltzmann equation, linearized\naround the reference homogeneous cooling state (see Section 3 below). The\nhydrodynamic part of its spectrum is identified first in the long wavelength\nlimit. Hydrodynamics refers to systematic approximations to the macroscopic\nbalance equations for the local relevant densities (here our choice is the deviations of number density, temperature, and flow velocity from their values in the homogeneous state). Consequently, we first derive these equations\nand find they are closed without approximation in the long wavelength limit.\nThese asymptotic equations determine d+2 hydrodynamic eigenvalues, where\nd is the dimensionality of the system. For normal fluids these are all zero,\nwhile for granular systems there are three distinct eigenvalues, one of which\nis d-fold degenerate. The corresponding eigenvalues for the linearized Boltzmann equation then identify its asymptotic hydrodynamic spectrum. The\nhydrodynamic spectrum more generally is defined to be the eigenvalues that\n\n\fLinearized Boltzmann Equation\n\n3\n\nare continuously connected to these asymptotic values in the long wavelength\nlimit. The expression \"hydrodynamic mode\" means the hydrodynamic eigenfunction with an exponential time dependence, in the appropriate time units,\ncharacterized by the corresponding hydrodynamic eigenvalue. A primary new\ncontribution here is the calculation of these hydrodynamic eigenfunctions in\nthe long wavelength limit, showing their difference from the local conserved\ndensities.\nWith the hydrodynamic eigenfunctions identified, the hydrodynamic part\nof the solution to the linearized Boltzmann equation can be extracted. This\nis the dominant contribution for large times and long wavelengths. More\nspecifically, this hydrodynamic part is calculated to first order in the gradients of the hydrodynamic fields and the result is used to calculate the\naverage fluxes in the macroscopic balance equations at finite wavelengths.\nThis provides the Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics for granular gases, and allows identification of the transport coefficients. The results agree with those\nfrom the Chapman-Enskog method [5,8] and the Green-Kubo representation\nof Ref. [11]. However, their derivation here exposes more clearly the hydrodynamic eigenfunctions and their role as the origin of key differences from\ngases with elastic collisions.\nIn the next Section, the nonlinear Boltzmann equation for a granular gas\nis defined, and the exact balance equations for the density, temperature, and\nflow velocity are derived from it. The homogeneous state of these equations\ncorresponds to global cooling, and the corresponding homogeneous cooling\nsolution (HCS) to the nonlinear Boltzmann equation is described. This solution represents the homogeneous state about which small spatial perturbations are considered. The corresponding linear Boltzmann equation and\nlinear balance equations for these small perturbations are then described.\nNext, the eigenvalue problem for the generator of the time dependence in the\nlinearized Boltzmann equation is defined in Section 4, and the hydrodynamic\neigenfunctions and eigenvalues are calculated in the long wavelength limit.\nThese results are used in Section 5 to derive the Navier-Stokes hydrodynamic\nequations, with expressions for the transport coefficients in terms of the linearized Boltzmann collision operator. Their equivalence with previous results\nfrom the Chapman-Enskog method is demonstrated, and these expressions\nare also given a Green-Kubo representation. Finally, the analysis is recapitulated, and implications for a more general treatment of transport in rapid\ngranular fluids beyond the low density context are discussed.\n\n\f4\n\nJ.

(40)\u2013(42) can be derived also by linearizing the nonlinear\nbalance equations (13)-(15). They are the starting point for deriving hydrodynamic equations, since they describe the evolution of the hydrodynamic\nfields in the linear approximation. This requires closing the equations, transforming the formal expressions of the pressure tensor, the heat flux, and the\ncooling rate into expressions in terms of the own hydrodynamic fields. These\nare the so-called constitutive relations.\n\n\fLinearized Boltzmann Equation\n\n4\n\n9\n\nEigenvalue Problem\n\nIn this Section we explore solutions to the linearized Boltzmann equation\nand characterize the hydrodynamic modes. This is done through a formal\nanalysis of the eigenvalue problem for the associated linear operator. Since\nthe equation is linear and the collision operator \u039b does not change the space\nvariable, it is sufficient to consider a single Fourier mode, i.e. we take\n\u03b4\u03c7(l, c, s) = eik*l \u03b4 \u03c7\ne(k, c, s).\n\n(48)\n\nThe linearized Boltzmann equation, Eq. (34), then becomes\n\nwhose formal solution is\n\n\u2202\n\u03b4\u03c7\ne = (\u039b \u2212 ik * c) \u03b4 \u03c7\ne,\n\u2202s\n\n(49)\n\n\u03b4\u03c7\ne(k, c, s) = es(\u039b\u2212ik*c) \u03b4 \u03c7\ne(k, c, 0).\n\n(50)\n\n(\u039b \u2212 ik * c) \u03bei (k, c) = \u03bbi (k) \u03bei (k, c).\n\n(51)\n\nThe above expression shows most clearly that the possible excitations for the\ngas under these conditions of small initial perturbations are determined by\nthe spectrum of the linear operator \u039b \u2212 ik * c. This suggests a study of the\neigenvalue problem\n\nThe problem is posed in a Hilbert space of functions of c with a scalar\nproduct given by\nZ\n\u2217\n< g|h >= dc \u03c7\u22121\n(52)\nHCS (c)g (c)h(c),\nwhere g \u2217 denotes the complex conjugate of g. Of particular interest here are\nthe eigenfunctions \u03bbh\u03b2 and eigenvalues \u03c7h\u03b2 (c) associated with linear hydrodynamics. These can be identified as follows. First, at k = 0 they correspond\nto those eigenvalues of \u039b alone that coincide with the zeroth order in the\ngradients eigenvalues of the linearized balance equations (40)-(42), which are\neasily seen to be 0, \u03b60 /2, and \u2212\u03b60 /2, i.e.\n\u039b\u03be\u03b2h (c) = \u03bbh\u03b2 \u03be\u03b2h (c),\n\n\u03bbh\u03b2 = 0, \u00b1\n\n\u03b60\n,\n2\n\n(53)\n\nwhere \u03be\u03b2h (c) stands for \u03be\u03b2h (k = 0, c). More generally, at finite k the hydrodynamic modes are defined to be the solutions of Eq. (51) that are continuously\nconnected to those of Eq. (53) as k \u2192 0. The eigenvalue problem (53) is\nsolved below, so the existence of the hydrodynamic modes is assured. The\nformal solution (50) then can be decomposed in the form\nX\n\u03b4\u03c7\ne(k, c, s) =\ne\nah\u03b2 (k, s)\u03be\u03b2h (k, c) + \u03b4 \u03c7\nem (k, c, s).\n(54)\n\u03b2\n\n\f10\n\nJ. Javier Brey et al.\n\nThe first term arises from the hydrodynamic modes while the second one\nrepresents all the other \"microscopic\" excitations. The hydrodynamic coefficients e\nah\u03b2 (k, s) can be expressed as\nh\ne\nah\u03b2 (k, s) = es\u03bb\u03b2 (k) < \u03be\u0304\u03b2h (k, c)|\u03b4\u03c7(k, c, 0) >=< \u03be \u0304\u03b2h (k, c)|\u03b4\u03c7(k, c, s) > .\n\n(55)\n\nSince \u039b\u2212ik*c is not self-adjoint, the functions \u03be \u0304\u03b2h (k, c) differ from \u03be\u03b2h (k, c) but\ntogether they must form a biorthogonal set. It will appear below that these\ncoefficients are closely related to the hydrodynamic fields of the linearized\nbalance equations.\nThe expected context for a hydrodynamic description is now clear. For\ngiven initial conditions both hydrodynamic and microscopic excitations contribute to (54). However, for long wavelengths (small k) it is expected that\nthe microscopic excitations decay on time scales short compared to those for\nthe hydrodynamic modes, leaving only the latter on long time scales. The relevant separation of time scales is expected to occur after a few collisions, so\nthere is a large and interesting time scale for the hydrodynamic description.\nPreliminary analysis based on kinetic models for the Boltzmann equation [15\u2013\n17] and also on low order matrix representations of the linearized Boltzmann\ncollision operator [18], suggest that the separation of modes assumed here\ndoes occur, and hydrodynamics does dominate for wavelengths and times\nlong compared with the mean free path and the mean free time, respectively.\nFurthermore, it appears from these models that the cooling rate \u03b60 remains\nsmaller than the collision frequency even for strong inelasticity, so that inclusion of the non-conserved energy among the hydrodynamic variables seems\njustified.\nHydrodynamic modes for k = 0\nWe consider now the eigenproblem associated with the linearized homogeneous Boltzmann operator,\n\u039b\u03bei (c) = \u03bbi \u03bei (c).\n\n(56)\n\nOf course, finding all the solutions of this equation is an impossible task, even\nin the elastic limit. Nevertheless, it is quite easy to obtain some particular\nsolutions, which will turn out to be the relevant ones in the hydrodynamic\nregime. We begin by constructing the function\nF (c, \u03c1, \u03c9, \u03b3) \u2261 \u03c1\u03c7HCS (\u03b3C),\n\n(57)\n\nwhere C = c \u2212 \u03c9. Although F has the functional form of a \"local\" HCS\ndistribution, the parameters \u03c1, \u03c9, and \u03b3 do not need to have any particular\nmeaning here, playing just the role of auxiliary parameters. From Eq. (27) it\nis obtained that F verifies\n\u03c1 \u2202\n\u03b60\n* (CF ) = \u03b3 d+1 J \u2032 [F |F ] .\n2 \u2202c\n\n(58)\n\n\fLinearized Boltzmann Equation\n\n11\n\nThen, taking derivatives with respect to \u03c1, \u03c9, and \u03b3 in the above equation\nand, afterwards, the limit \u03c1 = \u03b3 = 1 , \u03c9 = 0, leads to the set of equations\n1\n\u039b\u03c81 (c) = \u2212 \u03b60 \u03c83 (c),\n2\nwhere\n\n\u039b\u03c82 (c) =\n\n1\n\u03b60 \u03c8 2 (c),\n2\n\n1\n\u039b\u03c83 (c) = \u2212 \u03b60 \u03c83 (c), (59)\n2\n\n\u0013\n\u2202F\n= \u03c7HCS (c),\n\u2202\u03c1 0\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202F\n\u2202\u03c7HCS (c)\n\u03c8 2 (c) \u2261\n=\u2212\n,\n\u2202\u03c9 0\n\u2202c\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202F\n\u2202\n\u03c83 (c) \u2261 \u2212\n\u2212 \u03c7HCS (c)d = \u2212\n* [c\u03c7HCS (c)] .\n\u2202\u03b3 0\n\u2202c\n\u03c81 (c) \u2261\n\n\u0012\n\n(60)\n(61)\n(62)\n\nHere the zero subindex indicates that the derivatives are evaluated at \u03c1 =\n\u03b3 = 1, \u03c9 = 0. From Eqs. (59) it is easily seen that the set of functions\n{\u03be\u03b2 (c)} \u2261 {\u03c81 (c) \u2212 \u03c83 (c), \u03c8 2 (c), \u03c83 (c)}\n\n(63)\n\nare solutions of Eq.

The eigenvalue \u03bb2 is, therefore, d-fold degenerate. This confirms\n(53) above, indicating points in the spectrum at k = 0 corresponding to\nthe linear balance equations. Hence, these are the hydrodynamic modes at\nlongest wavelengths, \u03be\u03b2h (c).\nThe eigenfunctions \u03be\u03b2h (c) can be interpreted as follows. Consider a lo(l)\n\ncal form of the HCS distribution, fHCS , whereby the hydrodynamics fields\nare replaced by their actual space and time dependent values in a general\nnonequilibrium state,\n(l)\u2212d\n\n(l)\n\nfHCS (r, v, t) = n(r, t)v0\nwhere\nC=\n\nv \u2212 \u03b4u(r, t)\n(l)\n\nv0 (t)\n\n,\n\n(l)\n\nv0 (t) =\n\n(t)\u03c7HCS (C),\n\u0014\n\n2T (r, t)\nm\n\n\u00151/2\n\n(65)\n\n.\n\n(66)\n\nThis is the analogous to the local equilibrium distribution for elastic collisions. It represents a state whose averages values of 1, v , and v 2 are those\nof the nonequilibrium state. This seems a reasonable choice to describe an\nexperimentally prepared state. The linearization of such an state around the\nHCS gives\n(l)\n\nfHCS (r, v, t) \u2192 fHCS (v, t) + nH v0\u2212d (t)\u03b4\u03c7(l) (c, l, s),\n\n(67)\n\n\f12\n\nJ.

(68)\n2\nh\nThus, the eigenfunctions \u03be\u03b2 (c) describe the linear deviation of the local HCS,\nappearing then as the natural perturbations for a macroscopic preparation\nof the initial nonequilibrium state. This will be discussed further below.\nIt is easy to show that the functions {\u03be\u03b2h (c)} are linearly independent so\nthat they define a d + 2 dimensional subspace of the Hilbert space. Although\nthe functions \u03c8\u03b2 (c) are orthogonal with the definition of scalar product in\nEq. (52), the eigenfunctions \u03be\u03b2h (c) are not, as a consequence of the operator \u039b\nbeing non-Hermitian.

Nevertheless, for our purposes here, and also\nn for many other\no\napplications, it will suffice to identify a set of functions \u03be \u0304h (c), \u03b2 = 1, 2, 3\n\u03b2\n\nverifying the biorthonormality condition\n\n< \u03be \u0304\u03b2h |\u03be\u03b2h\u2032 >= \u03b4\u03b2,\u03b2 \u2032 ,\n\n(71)\n\n\u03b2, \u03b2 \u2032 = 1, 2, 3.

The fact that they are linear combinations of 1, c, and c2\nis closely related with the existence and approach to a hydrodynamic description, as it will be shown in the next Section. Let us stress that while\nh\n\u03be \u03041h (c) and \u03be\u03042 (c) are eigenfunctions of \u039b+ corresponding to the eigenvalues 0\nand \u03b60 /2, respectively, the function \u03be\u03043h (c) is not an eigenfunction of \u039b+ .

Then\n\u03c7HCS (c) becomes the Maxwellian \u03c7MB (c) = \u03c0 \u2212d/2 exp(\u2212c2 ) and the right\neigenfunctions are given by\n\b\u0002 2\n\u0003\n2c \u2212 (d + 1) \u03c7MB (c), 2c\u03c7MB (c), (2c2 \u2212 d)\u03c7MB (c) .\n(75)\n\nOf course, these functions are not orthogonal and differ from those usually\nemployed in the linear analysis of the elastic Boltzmann equation [19]. This\nis an important point, since when solving the eigenvalue problem associated\nwith the inelastic homogeneous Boltzmann equation by means of a perturbation calculus around the elastic limit, the first step in the perturbation\nscheme is to remove the degeneracy of the elastic zeroth eigenvalue by exactly\nsolving the perturbed eigenvalue problem within the subspace spanned by the\ndegenerate eigenfunctions. The relevant conclusion is that the functions \u03be\u03b2h (c)\nappear in a natural way even when considering the small inelasticity limit.\n\n5\n\nNavier-Stokes and Green-Kubo expressions\n\nIn the last section the hydrodynamic modes were defined and calculated at\nasymptotically long wavelengths. It remains to identify the hydrodynamic\ncoefficients in Eq. (54) as well as the hydrodynamic modes at finite k. Consider first the coefficients defined by Eq. (55 ) and evaluate the biorthogonal\nfunction \u03be \u0304\u03b2h (k, c) to leading order in k, so that\ne\nah\u03b2 (k, s) \u2192< \u03be \u0304\u03b2h (c)|\u03b4\u03c7(k, c, s) > .\n\n(76)\n\nUse of the expressions given in Eq.

They are the same\nfor long wavelengths and small perturbations, as expected.\n5.1\n\nNavier-Stokes Approximation\n\nTo obtain the hydrodynamic eigenvalues \u03bbh\u03b2 (k) to Navier-Stokes (k 2 ) order,\nthe eigenvalue problem (51) can be solved treating ic * k as a small perturbation of the operator \u039b [20]. This method implicitly restricts k to be small\nrelative to the deviation of the restitution coefficient \u03b1 from unity, the elastic\nlimit. A more uniform description, without restrictions on k relative to \u03b1, is\nobtained by calculating the fluxes in the balance equations as functions of\n\n\f14\n\nJ.

(87) contains, besides\nthe usual Fourier law characterized by the heat conductivity \u03ba\u0303, an additional\ncontribution proportional to the density gradient and with an associated\ntransport coefficient \u03bc\u0303. This latter term has no analogue in elastic gases.\nThe expressions of the (time-dependent) transport coefficients are\n\u03c6(l, s) = \u2212\u03ba\u0303\n\nd\n\n\u03b7\u0303(s) =\n\nX\n1\n2\nd + d \u2212 2 i,j\n\nZ\n\ndc \u2206ij (c)F2,ij (c, s),\n\n(88)\n\nZ\n1\ndc \u03a3(c) * F3 (c, s),\n(89)\nd\nZ\n1\n\u03bc\u0303 =\ndc\u03a3(c) * F1 (c, s).\n(90)\nd\nAs already mentioned, the functions \u2206ij (c)\u03c7HCS (c) and \u03a3i (c)\u03c7HCS (c) are\northogonal to the subspace spanned by the right eigenfunctions \u03be\u03b2 (c). Therefore, the decay of the \"correlation functions\" in Eqs. (88)\u2013(90) lies outside the\nspectrum of the slowest modes, and the s-time integral in the expression of\nthe functions F\u03b2 converges. Consequently, it is possible to set s \u2192 \u221e for times\nscales long compared with the microscopic times. In this way, the reduced\ntransport coefficients become time-independent.

They express the transport coefficients\nas integrals of time-correlations functions in the HCS. Although they are not\nidentical to those derived in Ref. [11] by a different method, it is easy to show\nthey are equivalent, since they differ in terms giving vanishing contributions.\nLet us also compare them with the expressions derived from the nonlinear\nBoltzmann equation by the Chapmann-Enskog method [5,8]. Consider the\nreduced shear viscosity coefficient. It is given by Eq. (88) with F2,ij defined\nin Eq. (84).

Equations (107) and (108) are equivalent to those derived by\nthe Chapman-Enskog procedure in Refs. [5,8], where the explicit expressions\nof the transport coefficients in the first Sonine approximation is obtained.\nA similar analysis leading to the same conclusion can be carried out for the\nother transport coefficients. The only conceptually relevant difference is in\nthe reference state. In the present linearized analysis the transport coefficients are defined in the HCS, whereas in the Chapmann-Enskog method\nthey are defined in a local HCS, characterized by the parameters n(r, t),\nu(r, t) and T (r, t). As a consequence, these are the fields appearing in the\nscaling in Eqs. (93)\u2013(95).\nIt is also instructive to consider the elastic limit \u03b1 \u2192 1 of the GreenKubo expressions derived here. In that case, we already know that the HCS\ndistribution becomes the Maxwellian \u03c7MB , and \u03b60 \u2192 0. Then, the functions\ndefined in Eqs.

For elastic systems, the temperature is constant\nto lowest order in the gradients of the hydrodynamic fields and, therefore, in\nthe integrands appearing in the above expressions the definition of the scale\ns, given by Eq. (24), reduces to s = v0 t/l, i.e. it is simply proportional to\nthe actual time. Then, Eqs. (110) and ( 111) are the low density limit of the\nusual Green-Kubo expressions for the transport coefficients in terms of the\nautocorrelation functions of the microscopic fluxes of the relevant densities\n[9].\n\n6\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe primary results of the above analysis have been the identification of\nhydrodynamic modes in the spectrum of the linearized Boltzmann operator,\ntheir leading order calculation in Section 4, and their use to derive the NavierStokes approximations to the heat and momentum fluxes. Of particular interest are the long wavelength forms of the hydrodynamic eigenfunctions \u03be\u03b2h\ngiven in Eq. (63), which are not simply linear combinations of the conserved\ndensities 1, v, v 2 . It is clear from (54) that perturbations of the homogeneous\nstate due to \u03be\u03b2h (c) generate the hydrodynamic excitations, while the response\nto these excitations is measured by the fields e\nah\u03b2 (s). These fields are averages\nof the biorthogonal set of functions \u03be\u0304\u03b2 , which are linear combinations of the\nconserved densities 1, v, v 2 , as required by the macroscopic balance equations.\nAs anticipated\nin the Introduction, this \"conjugate\" relationship between the\nn o\n\b\nh\nsets \u03be\u03b2 and \u03be\u0304\u03b2 is a key difference between normal and granular gases.\nFor elastic collisions, the two sets of fields are the same. This has important consequences for the derivation of transport properties as it has been\nillustrated here. For example, the reduction leading to the Navier-Stokes approximation in Eq. (80), depends critically on the fact that the functions \u03be\u03b2h\n\n\fLinearized Boltzmann Equation\n\n19\n\nare eigenfunctions of \u039b. Any other choice for the initial perturbation would\nlead to a different time dependence, mixing microscopic and hydrodynamic\nexcitations, and precluding direct identification of transport properties.\nThe identification of the hydrodynamic modes discussed here is important\nfor the application of linear response methods [21] to granular systems. In\norder to illustrate it, let us consider again the formal solution to the linear\nBoltzmann equation given in (50) and choose for the initial condition the\nlinearization of a local HCS as given by Eq. (67),\nX\n\u03b4\u03c7\ne(k, c, s) = es(\u039b\u2212ik*c)\n< \u03be \u0304\u03b2h |\u03b4 \u03c7\ne(0) > \u03be\u03b2h (c)\n\u03b2\n\n=e\n\ns(\u039b\u2212ik*c)\n\nX\n\na\u03b2 (k, s = 0)\u03be\u03b2h (c).\n\n(112)\n\n\u03b2\n\nThis initial state clearly represents a hydrodynamic perturbation. The response a\u03b2 (k, s) is then given by\nX\na\u03b2 (k, s) =\nR\u03b2\u03b2 \u2032 (k, s)a\u03b2 \u2032 (k, s = 0), R\u03b2\u03b2 \u2032 (k, s) =< \u03be \u0304\u03b2h |es(\u039b\u2212ik*c) \u03be\u03b2h\u2032 > .\n\u03b2\u2032\n\n(113)\nThe response functions R\u03b2\u03b2 \u2032 (k, s) are time correlation functions comprised of\nthe pair of the conjugate densities. It can be shown that application of standard linear response methods to these response functions leads to the correct\nGreen-Kubo relations with the proper convergence properties for the time\nintegrals. Conversely,\nthe same procedure applied to correlation functions\n\b\ncomprised of the \u03be \u0304\u03b2 alone does not lead directly to well-posed Green-Kubo\nexpressions. Let us also mention that linear perturbations of the kind considered in Eq. (112) have been used [22]in direct Monte Carlo simulations of the\nBoltzmann equation [23], to verify the validity of the linear hydrodynamic\ndescription and the explicit expressions of the transport coefficients.\nAlthough the analysis here has been limited to the low density linearized\nBoltzmann equation, these considerations point the way for a proper application of linear response methods in the more general context of nonequilibrium\nstatistical mechanics.\nThe research of J.W.D. reported here was supported in part by the Department of Energy Grants DE-FG03-98DP00218 and DE-FG02ER54677.\nThe research of J.J.B. and M.J.R. was partially supported by the Ministerio\nde Ciencia y Tecnolog\u0131\u0301a (Spain) through Grant No. BFM2002-00307.\n\nReferences\n1.
