Yet, Helium\nprovides the only example of an elemental solid that can be melted isobarically by lowering\nthe temperature, although this only occurs in a small range of pressures. This striking\nphenomenon, which is still poorly understood, is evidenced in the low-temperature phase\ndiagrams of both 3 He and 4 He by a decreasing profile of the solid-liquid coexistence pressure\nPcox as a function of temperature T [1]. Another kind of IM is provided by P4MP1 polymer\nsolutions [2], where a tetragonal crystal undergoes amorphization on cooling, accompanied\nby heat release.\nThe existence of IM fights against common sense but by no means disproves thermodynamics [3, 4]. The slope of Pcox (T ) is ruled by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation,\ndPcox\nS2 \u2212 S1\n=\n,\ndT\nV2 \u2212 V1\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere V1 , V2 and S1 , S2 are the volume and entropy values of the coexisting phases. Nothing\nprevents a phase transition to occur, at fixed external pressure, from a low-temperature\nphase 1 to a high-temperature phase 2 with both volume contraction and positive latent\nheat, hence with negative \u2206S/\u2206V (this is the case, for instance, of ordinary ice and water).\nWhat is peculiar to Helium IM is that the more compact and more entropic phase is solid\nrather than liquid. The case of P4MP1 is different: Here \u2206S/\u2206V > 0, but the solid still\nlies on the high-temperature side of the transition.\nGenerally speaking, IM requires some microscopic mechanism by which spatially-confined\nparticles can nonetheless have more entropy than the coexisting liquid. In 3 He, the nuclear\nspins are more coupled (i.e., less free to orient independently of each other) in the liquid\nthan in the solid phase. Inverse melting of P4MP1 is explained by a larger amount of\npolymer conformations in the crystal than in the amorphous state, due to a more open\ncrystal structure.\nPursuing the analogy with the above systems, the few models of IM proposed so far have\ninvariably focussed on systems of particles with internal degrees of freedom [5, 6]. When the\nsingle-particle states are taken to be more degenerate in the ordered than in the disordered\nphase, IM can occur. In practice, one needs a very fine tuning of the single-particle spectrum\nto obtain a realistic IM scenario.\n1\n\n\fThe purpose of this paper is to show that IM \u2013 or an analog of it \u2013 is also observed in\nsystems that are hosted on a lattice. The model presented here is a classical lattice-gas\nsystem which, with no other ingredients than the radial dependence of its pair-interaction\nstrenght, exhibits a phase behavior that is reminiscent of Helium. In particular, 1) the system\ncan exist in a loose-packed phase down to zero temperature for low enough pressures; and\n2) in a range of pressures, the close-packed solid melts into a less dense structure upon\ncooling. This phase is crystalline at very low temperatures, but can be a liquid at higher\ntemperatures. Besides the similarities, however, the present IM has conceivably little to do\nwith Helium: While IM of the latter has a quantum-mechanical origin, the phenomenon\nherein discussed heavily relies on the steric constraints being determined by the interplay\nbetween lattice geometry and interaction. Specifically, it deals with the different free-energy\ncost, at low temperature, of vacancy-like excitations in the loose-packed solid and in the\nclose-packed one. In fact, any lattice potential that is provided with an extended hard-core\nrepulsion, a shoulder, and a thin attractive well would prove adequate to bend downward\nPcox (T ) at T = 0.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, after introducing a class of\nlattice gases that could possibly share some features in common with Helium, I outline an\nanalytic method for checking the existence of IM. Then, in Section 3, I describe the numerical\ntechniques that are used to work out the phase diagram of such a lattice gas. Results are\npresented in Section 4, where a comparison is made between two similar case studies, in an\nattempt to unveil general rules of behavior. Some further remarks and conclusions are given\nin Section 5.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL\n\nClassical lattice gases provide caricatural descriptions of real fluids that, while broadly\npreserving the topology of the phase diagram, are by far much simpler to study both analytically and numerically [7, 8, 9, 10]. If the aim is finding a lattice-gas system with a\nHelium-type phase diagram, but with no ambition to model a real substance, working in\ntwo dimensions is by no means restrictive, in fact it is convenient for a twofold reason: The\ntransfer-matrix method, which is the most powerful technique for reconstructing numerically\nthe phase diagram of a lattice gas, is a viable tool only in two dimensions. Moreover, with\n2\n\n\fan eye to making use also of low-temperature expansions for the analysis, enumeration of\nground-state defects/excitations is much easier in two than in three dimensions.\nThe type of models here considered is a lattice-gas system hosted on the triangular lattice.\nA given lattice site can be either occupied (by a single particle) or empty. Calling ci = 0, 1\nP\nthe occupation number of site i, the lattice-gas Hamiltonian reads i<j v(|i \u2212 j|)ci cj , with a\n\npair potential v depending on site-site separation only. In the very first place, this potential\nis asked to meet two conditions: 1) It must allow for the existence of two disordered phases,\n\"vapor\" and \"liquid\"; 2) two different crystalline phases should be stable at T = 0, say\n\n\"solid A\" at high pressures and \"solid B\" at low pressures. However, the real challenge is\nto find a model where \"solid B\" and \"liquid\" are actually the same phase or, at least, have\nsimilar thermodynamic properties along the transition line.\nI have shown elsewhere [10] that an extended hard core in the potential, when associated\nwith an attractive tail, brings forth two distinct fluid phases into the system. Likewise, to\nobserve a pressure-driven solid-solid transition at T = 0, v(r) must have a shoulder before the\nminimum [8, 11, 12]; with this trick, the minimum-energy configuration (which is dominant\nat low temperatures and pressures) is kept distinct from the close-packed configuration\n(which is preferred at high pressures). Yet, these two requirements alone do not imply a\nunique potential, since the extent of the hard core (i.e., the particle diameter) as well as the\nheight and width of the shoulder relative to the well remain at will. The following potentials,\ndefining the LG34 and LG56 models, are just two of a host of choices:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n+\u221e\n,\nfor\nr\n\u2264\nr\n+\u221e , for\n2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f2\n0 , for r = r3\n0 , for\nv34 (r) =\nand\nv56 (r) =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u2212\u01eb , for r = r4\n\u2212\u01eb , for\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\uf8f3\n0 , for r \u2265 r5\n0 , for\n\nr \u2264 r4\nr = r5\nr = r6\n\n(2.1)\n\nr \u2265 r7 ,\n\nwhere rn is the distance between a pair of n-th neighbor lattice sites and \u01eb > 0 sets the\ntemperature scale. A pictorial description of these models can be found in Fig. 1.\nTo determine whether an IM is possible or definitely excluded in a lattice gas with two\ndistinct solid ground states, the low-temperature profile of the solid-solid Pcox (T ) is con-\n\nstructed, looking for a downward bending near T = 0. However, a negative slope is not\nsufficient evidence of a genuine IM unless a continuous path exists from solid B to liquid, a\nquestion that can only be settled numerically, by e.g. the transfer-matrix method.\n3\n\n\fI recall that, for given temperature T and chemical potential \u03bc, the equilibrium state of a\nsystem with fixed volume V is the one minimizing the generalized thermodynamic potential\n\u03a9\u0303 = E \u2212 T S(E, V, N) \u2212 \u03bcN as a function of energy E and particle number N, S(E, V, N)\nbeing the system entropy function [13]. The minimum \u03a9\u0303 defines the system grand potential\n\u03a9, whereas \u2212\u03a9/V is the equilibrium pressure P expressed in terms of T and \u03bc. At T = 0,\nthe eligible configurations of a lattice gas are only a few, each continuously linked with a\npossible system phase at T > 0. T = 0 transitions occur in coincidence with any jump in\nthe values of E and N at the point of minimum of \u03a9\u0303.\nIn the LG56 model, for example, only three states are involved at T = 0, namely two\ntriangular crystals (solid A and solid B) and the vacuum (the T = 0 vapor) \u2013 other solid\nphases, with rectangular rather than triangular symmetry, are excluded. With a slight abuse\nof terminology, the same three phases are hereafter termed solid, liquid, and vapor (in other\nwords, I use \"solid B\" and \"liquid\" interchangeably as synonyms of a low-temperature loosepacked phase). In the liquid phase, the number density \u03c1 takes values that are intermediate\nbetween those of solid and vapor. To set the notation, let a be the triangular-lattice spacing\n\u221a\nand vc = ( 3/4)a2 the elementary-cell volume \u2013 the total number of lattice sites is M =\nV /vc . The T = 0 values of \u03a9/M for the three phases are \u2212\u03bc/9, (\u22123\u01eb \u2212 \u03bc)/12, and 0,\nrespectively. Whence a liquid-vapor transition at \u03bc = \u03bcLV \u2261 \u22123\u01eb, followed by a solid-liquid\n\u2217\ntransition at \u03bc = \u03bcSL \u2261 9\u01eb. The coexistence pressures in reduced, \u01eb/vc units are PLV\n= 0 and\n\u2217\nPSL\n= 1, respectively. A similar treatment for the LG34 model yields T = 0 phase transitions\n\nat \u03bc = \u22123\u01eb and \u03bc = 4\u01eb, with the same reduced values of the coexistence pressures as for\nLG56.\nIn order to extend the analysis to non-zero (small) temperatures, I proceed as follows.\nFor each phase of the model, I list the allowed configurations (i.e., with no overlapping\nparticles) that are obtained from the ground state by removing or adding few particles.\nAfterwards, for each excited state I calculate the multiplicity and the Boltzmann weight in\nterms of M, \u03b2\u03bc, and \u03b2\u01eb (\u03b2 = (kB T )\u22121 , where kB is Boltzmann's constant). Finally, for each\npair of coexisting phases, particle configurations are ordered by increasing relevance close to\nthe transition threshold. The goal is to come up with an approximate expression for the \u03a9\nof each phase that could next be used to draw the low-temperature portion of the transition\nlines.\nThe detailed working out of these truncated expansions is rather lengthy. In the Ap4\n\n\fpendix, only a sketch of the derivation is presented, using the LG56 model as an example.\nBesides that, also the relevant expansions for the LG34 model are reported. For both models, the solid-liquid Pcox (T ) shows a decreasing behavior at low temperature, leaving room\nfor an IM in both cases (see Figs. 9-12). While postponing to Section 4 the integration of\nthese results with the full transfer-matrix data, I here comment on the mechanism that is\nresponsible for a larger entropy of the solid phase at coexistence. As specifically illustrated\nin the Appendix for the LG56 model, in the liquid phase there is a strong imbalance between vacancies and interstitials as for free-energy cost: At low temperature, vacancies are\nfar more easily excited than interstitials, which instead require a considerable rearrangement\nof the local structure in order to make room for the extra particles. On the other hand,\nvacancies have a lower cost in the solid phase since any particle removal in the liquid goes\nalong with the rupture of many nearest-neighbor bonds, hence with a substantial energy\nincrease. The outcome is that, at T > 0, a smaller pressure than at zero temperature is\nrequired for stabilizing the solid phase.\n\nIII.\n\nMETHOD\n\nTo reconstruct the phase diagram of a lattice-gas model, I use the transfer-matrix method\nand, to some extent, also grand-canonical Monte Carlo (MC). If the interaction has an upper\ncutoff, the exact grand potential of a system being infinite in one spatial direction and finite\nin the other(s) can be computed as the logarithm of the maximum eigenvalue \u03bbmax of a so\ncalled transfer matrix (TM). In two dimensions, the simplest case occurs when this matrix\nencodes the interaction between a row of sites and the next row along the infinite strip\ndirection y. In this case, the matrix size equals the total number of states in a row. More\ngenerally, depending on the interaction range, the natural lattice unit (NLU) can consist of\njust one single row, or a pair of consecutive rows, or a triplet of rows, etc. In terms of \u03bbmax ,\nthe pressure of the strip reads:\nP =\n\nkB T\nln \u03bbmax ,\nNNLU\n\n(3.1)\n\nNNLU being the number of sites in the NLU. The number density \u03c1 = (\u2202P/\u2202\u03bc)T and\nits \u03b2\u03bc derivative, related to the isothermal compressibility by KT = \u03c1\u22122 (\u2202\u03c1/\u2202\u03bc)T , are\nevaluated from the raw \u03b2P data as a three-point numerical first- and second-order derivative,\nrespectively (\u03b2\u03bc is made to increase by steps of 0.005). As a rule, the number of iterations\n5\n\n\fthat are necessary to bring the maximum TM eigenvalue to convergence by the power method\nis larger the larger KT . Upon increasing the number Nx of sites in a row, phase-transition\nsignatures \u2013 in the form of peaks in (\u2202\u03c1/\u2202\u03bc)T \u2013 gradually emerge, allowing to extract the\ninfinite-size behavior. The virtue of the TM method is only limited by the range of the\npotential and by its core extension, which both determine the maximum x size that can be\nstored in the computer.\nThe TM study of two-dimensional (2D) lattice gases received a strong impulse in the mid\nsixties by the work of Runnels and coworkers [14, 15]: These authors provided a considerable\nsimplification in the problem by showing how to reduce the TM size substantially without\naffecting \u03bbmax . In practice, NLU states are grouped into equivalence classes bringing together\nstates that map onto each other when translated along x and/or reflected with respect to\nthe strip axis. Whence, a matrix that is a condensed form of the TM is defined, of size equal\nto the number of equivalence classes, whose maximum eigenvalue is the same as for the\noriginal TM. In Table 1, some typical dimensions are reported for the original TM and for\nits compactified form, with reference to the LG34 and LG56 models. Among many similar\nmodels, LG34 and LG56 provided the right compromise between large core extension and\nfeasibility of the TM analysis for quite large sizes.\nI have complemented the TM study with Metropolis MC simulations in the grandcanonical ensemble. Typically, two million MC sweeps are generated at equilibrium for\nL \u00d7 L triangular lattices of increasing size, up to a maximum of L = 240, with periodic\nboundary conditions. A MC sweep consists of one average attempt per site to change the\noccupation number. As a rule, simulation runs are carried out in a sequence, starting at a\nlow \u03b2\u03bc value from the empty lattice and then raising \u03b2\u03bc progressively at fixed temperature.\nIn the region of solid-liquid coexistence, equilibrium sampling could be obstructed by liquid\nundercooling, i.e., by hysteresis. This is why, at high densities, the TM method (where\navailable) is to be preferred to MC simulations.\nAmong the computed quantities, the reduced number density \u03c1\u2217 \u2261 \u03c1 vc and the isothermal\ncompressibility KT are especially monitored. These are expressed in terms of grand-canonical\naverages as\n\u03c1\u2217 = hN i /L2\n\nand \u03c1 kB T KT =\n\n(\u2206N )2\n,\nhN i\n\nwith \u2206N = N \u2212 hN i, N being the current particle number.\n6\n\n(3.2)\n\n\fFinally, a useful tool for identifying the order of a phase transition is to follow, e.g. for\ngiven \u03b2, the evolution of the MC density histogram as a function of \u03bc. In a finite system, a\nroughly Gaussian peak in this histogram is the imprint of a homogeneous phase, a secondorder transition (or just a crossover) is signalled by a broader peak, while phase coexistence\nappears as a bimodal density distribution. Hence, it is possible to discriminate between\nsmooth/continuous and first-order condensation by just looking at the \u03bc-evolution of the\ndensity histogram at fixed temperature.\n\nIV.\n\nA.\n\nRESULTS\n\nLG34 model\n\nThis model was studied with the TM method only, considering just one lattice strip 14\nsites wide. This is the smallest size allowing both solid ground states to be accommodated\ninto the strip. The next suited size, 28, is just too big for being amenable to numerical\nanalysis by the TM method.\nIn Fig. 2, I show results for three isotherms somehow representative of the different\nregimes, the overall phase diagram being represented in Fig. 3. It is clear that, beyond\na fluid phase and a solid of (reduced) density \u2248 1/4, there is also an intermediate solid B\nphase, of density \u2248 1/7, which is present only at low temperature. As temperature grows,\nthe border which marks the region of solid B stability gets thinner till it disappears, leaving\na passage into the fluid. However, this is an effect of the finite strip size while, in the thermodynamic limit, there will likely be no way to enter solid B smoothly from the fluid. Hence,\ncalling \"solid\" the phase with \u03c1\u2217 \u2248 1/7 (rather than \"liquid\") is a proper usage. Finally,\nthe fluid phase shows vapor-like properties at low pressure, with densities lower than 1/7,\nwhile appearing liquid-like for high pressures, with densities higher than 1/7.\nThe two solids and the liquid meet in a triple point at T \u2217 \u2261 kB T /\u01eb \u2243 0.90 and P \u2217 \u2261\nP vc /\u01eb \u2243 0.98. Above this pressure, and up to P \u2217 = 1, the solid-solid transition under isobaric\nconditions anomalously occurs with volume contraction on heating, as already anticipated\nfrom the low-temperature expansions.\nThough the reported data are for just one strip size, their consistency with an exact lowtemperature analysis (see Figs. 11 and 12) and the sharpness of the transition signatures\n\n7\n\n\fmake me confident that the features observed in Fig. 3 give a faithful account of the phase\nbehavior of the model in the thermodynamic limit.\nThe LG34 model resembles the phase behavior of the purely repulsive lattice-gas model\nstudied in [16], hereby called LG3, where particles exclude first- and second-neighbor sites\non a triangular lattice while softly repelling each other at third-neighbor distance. Both\nmodels share the same phases, although LG34 is more effective in promoting the stability\nof the solids at the expense of the fluid. Moreover, the possibility of a solid-solid transition\nat constant pressure, further accompanied by a density increase on heating, is only peculiar\nto the LG34 model.\n\nB.\n\nLG56 model\n\nWith respect to LG34, hard-core exclusion now comprises also third- and fourth-neighbor\nsites. Nx must be a multiple of 6 in order that both solid ground states fit into the periodized\nstrip. Fig. 4 shows a selection of results, relative to a number of isothermal paths for Nx = 18.\nAt low temperature, there is a clear two-stage transition from vapor to solid A, with an\nintermediate phase of density \u2248 1/12. This phase has strong crystalline features, as signalled\nby the extremely small values of KT , hence it will tentatively be called solid B.\nUpon increasing the temperature, the character of the first transition gradually modifies, becoming smoother and smoother until it disappears for \u03b2\u01eb \u2248 0.38, leaving a direct\ntransition from vapor to solid A at higher temperatures. At the same time, the nature of\nthe intermediate phase also changes, since appreciable (0.1 or so) values of \u2202\u03c1\u2217 /\u2202\u03b2\u03bc give\nsupport to the idea that this phase is actually liquid (I shall add more evidence on this\nlater). The resulting phase diagram, see Fig. 5, resembles that of 4 He, with the obvious\ndifference that there is no superfluid region in the LG56 liquid. The most exciting feature of\nthe LG56 phase diagram is the clear IM behavior that is found in the narrow pressure range\nfrom \u2248 0.97 to 1 (see Fig. 5 inset). The mechanism upon which IM rests has been already\nclarified in Section 2: it deals with the lower cost of proliferating vacancies in solid A than\nin the low-temperature solid B.\nIn the same Fig. 5, I sketch the phase diagram of another model, called LG5. Its pair\npotential shares the same core with v56 (r), but it shows a repulsive \u01eb shoulder at r = r5 and\nno well. This purely-repulsive model cannot have a liquid phase, hence the \u03c1\u2217 \u2248 1/12 phase\n8\n\n\fshould be a triangular solid which, in the thermodynamic limit, will be separated from the\nfluid phase by an uninterrupted first-order line. The IM-like feature that is seen along the\nsolid-solid coexistence line of LG5 is probably an artefact of the finite strip size, since it\ndeflates upon going from Nx = 12 to 18.\nTo probe the exactness of the TM technique, I have carried out a series of MC simulations\nfor a 18 \u00d7 360 lattice at \u03b2\u01eb = 0.4. MC data points, reported as dots and asterisks in Fig. 4,\ndo clearly lie superimposed over the TM data. When the temperature is sufficiently high, a\nmore significant check of the TM results is provided by the calculation of the system pressure\nwith the method of thermodynamic integration. At high temperatures, the simulation can\nbe pushed through the transition region between liquid and solid, with no risk of bumping\ninto phase-space bottlenecks (in other words, no hysteresis or effective ergodicity breaking\nis observed). Eventually, \u03b2\u03bc becomes so high that the truncated expansion (A.10) of the\nLG56 solid pressure holds true. Combining this expansion with the MC values of the number\ndensity, I was able to obtain an estimate of the pressure at the point of maximum of \u2202\u03c1\u2217 /\u2202\u03b2\u03bc\n(the asterisk in Fig. 5 inset) that compares well with the TM datum.\nThe main question left open by the TM analysis concerns the nature of the \u03c1\u2217 \u2248 1/12\nphase: Is it actually a liquid? A related question is: Does the liquid-vapor boundary of the\ninfinite-size system really terminate near \u03b2\u01eb = 0.38 or it will rather join somewhere to the\nfreezing line, like in the LG5 case? Should the latter be true, it would indeed be hard to\nqualify the intermediate phase of the LG56 model as liquid.\nI have carried out MC simulations of large L \u00d7 L triangular lattices, up to L = 240, along\nthree isotherms, \u03b2 = 030, 0.34, and 0.38. Each series of runs was arrested at the edge of\nfreezing, i.e., before equilibrium statistics could become unefficiently sampled by MC. The\nvalues obtained for the number density and its \u03b2\u03bc derivative are reported in Fig. 6, together\nwith the TM data for Nx = 18. While leaving substantially unaltered (with respect to the\nTM hint) the location of freezing, the MC results clearly indicate that vapor condensation\npersists well beyond T \u2217 = 1/0.38, without merging into the freezing transition (see the\nasterisks in Fig. 7).\nFurther information on vapor condensation can be acquired by monitoring the density\nhistogram as a function of \u03b2\u03bc at constant temperature. This is drawn in Fig. 7 inset for\nL = 240 and \u03b2\u01eb = 0.38 (similar results are found for \u03b2\u01eb = 0.34 and 0.30). Note the\nsame Gaussian character and the comparable width of the density histograms on either side\n9\n\n\fof the condensation point. While a first-order condensation can be safely excluded from\nthese results, it would be hard to discriminate a locus of critical points from a disorder\nline. The numerical errors affecting particle-number fluctuations are not small enough to\ndecide, from the size scaling of the compressibility maximum, whether the condensation line\nterminates with a critical ending point or rather proceeds to infinite temperature. In any\ncase, a smooth vapor condensation can hardly be reconciled with the symmetry breaking\nthat would be implied by a phase transition into a triangular solid. It is true that there are\nlattice gases where the transition from vapor to solid is reported to be second-order or even\nsmoother, but this only occurs when the core diameter of the particles is very small [17].\nMoreover, the large values of \u2202\u03c1\u2217 /\u2202\u03b2\u03bc within the \u03b2\u03bc range of the intermediate phase are\nmore appropriate to a liquid than to a solid.\nThere is a last point to discuss, related to the possibility that a phase-transition line\nseparating solid B from liquid, running at about constant T , was overlooked by the present\nTM study, which considered only isothermal scans of the phase diagram. It is worth noting\nthat this was not the case for the LG34 model, where in fact the TM analysis revealed the\nexistence of a clear first-order boundary between the two phases. The question remains as\nto whether a smoother transition occurs in the LG56 case. To clarify this point, I carried\nout a TM study of the Nx = 12 and 18 strips along various constant-\u03bc lines. The locus\nof points where \u2202\u03c1\u2217 /\u2202\u03b2\u03bc is maximum as a function of temperature is reported as a dashed\nline in Fig. 7. By looking at this picture, one is tempted to conclude that solid B and liquid\nare actually distinct phases. In fact, things are more complicate since, for e.g. \u03bc = 8\u01eb,\nthe broad maximum of \u2202\u03c1\u2217 /\u2202\u03b2\u03bc occurs with no evidence of density jump \u2013 see Fig. 8. My\nconclusion is that either this maximum marks the crossover from a prominently liquid-like\nto a prominently solid B-like behavior within the same phase or there is an underlying weak\nfirst-order transition between liquid and solid B, characterized by a small jump of specific\nvolume. In the latter case, the seemingly negative slope of the phase boundary would be the\nresult, via Eq. (2.1), of a slight number-density decrease occurring upon going from liquid\nto solid B, which is consistent with the TM data of Fig. 8.\nFurther information is obtained from a series of MC simulations that I carried out for\n\u03bc = 8\u01eb, with \u03b2\u01eb ranging from 0.3 to 0.4. In Fig. 8, I report results for two sizes, L = 120\nand 240. It turns out that the only clear singularity occurs at \u03b2\u01eb \u2243 0.34, which corresponds\nto the same liquid-vapor transition found at \u03b2\u03bc \u2243 2.70 along the \u03b2\u01eb = 0.34 isotherm.\n10\n\n\fHowever, upon increasing \u03b2\u01eb a little further, the simulated system abruptly transformed\ninto an almost perfect realization of solid B, suggesting that what probably realizes in the\nLG56 model is the weak-transition scenario: The low-temperature liquid, which looks like\na disordered patchwork of solid A and solid B grains, is not capable to dismiss its solid\nA fraction continuously on cooling, being thus forced to transform into solid B abruptly.\nConsidering that the hypothetical solid B-liquid boundary appears to join to the locus of\nsolid A melting at about where the slope of the latter changes from negative to positive, the\nIM behavior of the LG56 model might not differ significantly from the LG34 model, though\nthe former is undoubtedly closer to realize the ideal IM scenario than the latter.\nFinally, let me draw some implications from the above results. From the arguments presented in the Appendix, it is evident that a decreasing freezing line on the T -P plane will\nbe the rule, at sufficiently low temperature, for all the potentials having the same shape of\nv56 (r). Whether this is an imprint of a genuine IM, rather than of a solid-solid transition\noccurring with volume contraction upon heating at constant pressure, is a complicate matter\nto grasp, which might be linked to the existence of a congruous number of liquid configurations that are proximal, as for number density, to the loose-packed crystalline ground\nstate. This is about to occur in the LG56 case, where the equilibrium liquid at moderately\nlow temperatures comes indeed very close, as for specific volume and entropy contents, to\na defected solid B. Supposedly, when both particle core and potential well become slightly\nenlarged with respect to the LG56 case, with the width of the barrier staying fixed, the\nlikelihood of observing a genuine IM will get enhanced.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nInverse melting (IM) is the phenomenon by which a crystal melts when cooled at constant\npressure. This can only occur if, at the transition point, the solid is more entropic than the\nliquid. Besides Helium at low temperature, the only system where an IM-like transition is\nobserved are some peculiar polymer solutions, denoted P4MP1.\nIn the present paper, I investigated the possibility of a lattice analog of IM. To this aim,\nI introduced a triangular-lattice-gas system, called LG56, where the particle diameter is 3,\nin units of the lattice constant, and there is a narrow attractive well at a bit larger distance,\n\u221a\n2 3 lattice units. The phase diagram of this system bears some indication of IM, similar\n11\n\n\fto that occurring in Helium by a completely different mechanism, which can be rationalized\nas follows: The soft inter-particle repulsion causes the existence of two distinct crystalline\nground states, a close-packed solid at high pressures and a more open crystal structure at\nlow pressures. When the core diameter is large enough, which is about the case of the LG56\nmodel, the loose-packed crystal will smoothly transform into a liquid at high temperatures,\ni.e., without crossing a neat phase boundary. In addition to that, the interplay between\ninteraction and lattice geometry produces two effects, both essential to promote IM: 1)\nInterstitials are heavily suppressed in the low-temperature liquid; 2) vacancies are more\neasily excited in the solid than in the liquid phase, thus conferring an entropic benefit to\nthe solid. As a result, the melting line on the T -P plane bends downward at sufficiently low\ntemperature.\nIt can be argued that a genuine IM cannot be observed in a softly-repulsive lattice-gas\nsystem since, upon lowering the temperature, any dense fluid phase should eventually turn\ninto a loose-packed solid. In fact, the real question is whether a stable liquid can be pushed\nto such low temperatures that, in a range of pressures, the close-packed solid first melts into\nthe liquid upon cooling, only after transforming into the loose-packed solid. The present\nstudy shows that the LG56 model is indeed close to realize this ideal IM scenario.\nI add a final remark on the transferability of the above results to soft-core potentials on\na 3D lattice. As far as the previously cited requisites on the inner-core and attractive-well\nextensions are met, I find no reason to think that the behavior in 3D will be much different.\nIn particular, the same mechanism leading in 2D to a minimum in the freezing pressure as a\nfunction of temperature will be at work also in 3D. Presumably, the only marked difference\nconcerns the order of the phase transitions, which are stronger in a higher-dimensionality\nspace. Consider, for instance, a 3D counterpart of the LG56 model. While the freezing, solid\nA-to-liquid transition of the LG56 model is strongly first-order already in 2D, the transition\nfrom solid B to liquid would be much neater in 3D, with the effect of removing any residual\nambiguity on the nature of the dashed-line crossover of Fig. 7.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the University of Messina.

Besides their intrinsic interest, these expansions may provide a consistency check of the TM results. For both lattice gases, an expansion of the grand partition\nfunction \u039e, from which the grand potential \u03a9 follows as \u2212kB T ln \u039e, is presented for all\nlow-temperature phases: solid, liquid, and vapor (in this appendix, I call \"liquid\" what is\nactually the loose-packed solid B phase). For a pair of competing phases, the transition line\nis located where the respective grand potentials are equal. The derivation of these expansions is rather lengthy and it would demand too space to be reported here with full detail,\nhence it will be just sketched. For one model (LG56), the high-\u03bc expansion of the solid\npressure is also displayed.\nLG56 model. - In the very cold vapor, there are just a few particles on an otherwise\nempty lattice. Leading terms in \u039e are those associated with the largest Boltzmann factors,\nhence with a small number of particles, better if linked by liquid-like bonds. The expansion\nof \u039eV will appear as:\nM(M \u2212 37) 2\u03b2\u03bc\ne + 3Me2\u03b2\u03bc e\u03b2\u01eb + 3M(M \u2212 61)e3\u03b2\u03bc e\u03b2\u01eb + 9Me3\u03b2\u03bc e2\u03b2\u01eb\n2\n+ 2Me3\u03b2\u03bc e3\u03b2\u01eb + 12Me4\u03b2\u03bc e4\u03b2\u01eb + 3Me4\u03b2\u03bc e5\u03b2\u01eb + . . .\n(A.1)\n\n\u039eV = 1 + Me\u03b2\u03bc +\n\nThe prefactors of the exponentials are multiplicities as calculated for the bulk system.\nSimilarly, in the very cold liquid, the microstates which occur with higher probability at\nequilibrium are obtained from the triangular crystal of density 1/12 by removing a small\nnumber of particles, better if bound to each other.

(2.1). When a particle\nis placed in the position marked as a full dot, crosses denote forbidden sites for the\ncenters of other particles. Open squares denote the lattice sites that are occupied\nby the nearest-neighbor particles of the central particle in the close-packed solid A.\nOpen dots denote attractive sites for the central particle: Here are placed its nearestneighbor particles in the loose-packed solid B. In the LG34 model, these attractive\nsites are twelve, contributing a twofold degeneracy to the spatial orientation of solid\nB.\nFig. 2 : LG34 model, TM results for Nx = 14. The reduced number density (dotted lines)\nand its \u03b2\u03bc derivative (continuous lines) are shown for three isotherms, \u03b2\u01eb = 0.75, 0.80,\nand 0.89. To help the eye, straight lines are drawn between data points. Peaks\nin the density derivative are the imprint of phase boundaries: As a rule, the more\npronounced a maximum is, the stronger the phase transition. The confluence of three\ndistinct phases (solid A, solid B, and liquid) at \u03b2\u01eb \u2248 0.90 is quite transparent from\nthe behavior at \u03b2\u01eb = 0.89 (see also Fig. 3 inset). Upon raising the temperature, the\nregion of solid B gradually shrinks until its boundaries fade away. However, in the\nthermodynamic limit, there will reasonably be no path to go smoothly from fluid to\nsolid B.\nFig. 3 : LG34 model, TM results for Nx = 14. Overall phase diagram of the system as\nresulting from joining the (T, P ) points that correspond to \u2202\u03c1\u2217 /\u2202\u03b2\u03bc peaks. The LG34\npotential (open dots and continuous lines) is contrasted with the LG3 repulsive law of\nRef. [16] (Nx = 14, open squares and dashed lines). Spline interpolants drawn between\nLG34 data points mark first-order phase boundaries; the interruptions are finite-size\neffects. The fluid phase is vapor-like at low pressure and liquid-like at high pressure.\nWhile both models can exist in three phases (solid A, solid B, and fluid), LG34 is\npeculiar in that it shows a solid-solid transition with volume contraction on heating\nat constant pressure (inset).\nFig. 4 : LG56 model, TM results for Nx = 18. The reduced number density (dotted lines)\nand its \u03b2\u03bc derivative (continuous lines) are shown for a number of isotherms, \u03b2\u01eb =\n20\n\n\f0.34, 0.38, 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7. To help the eye, straight lines are drawn between\ndata points. MC data for a 18 \u00d7 360 periodic sample, relative to \u03b2\u01eb = 0.4, are\nalso shown: Reduced number density (open dots) and its \u03b2\u03bc derivative (asterisks),\nas computed through the number fluctuations \u2013 see Eq. (3.2). Upon increasing the\ntemperature, the liquid-vapor peak progressively broadens till it disappears at \u03b2\u01eb =\n0.38. The solid-liquid peak is present at all temperatures: It is already very sharp for\n\u03b2\u01eb = 0.45, becoming even sharper for lower temperatures (not shown).\nFig. 5 : LG56 model, TM phase diagram for Nx = 12 (open triangles and dashed lines)\nand 18 (open dots and continuous lines). The phase diagram of LG56 is contrasted\nwith that of LG5 (Nx = 18, open squares and dashed lines). Both models can exist\nin three phases: However, while the dense phase of low pressure is solid B for the\npurely-repulsive LG5 model, the analogous phase for LG56 is liquid, at least for high\ntemperatures (see my arguments in Section 4.B). The LG56 model is peculiar in that\nan inverse melting occurs (inset). The asterisk is a point on the solid-liquid coexistence\nline of the wider LG56 strip that was constructed by MC (see main text). The shallow\nminimum in the solid-solid Pcox (T ) of LG5 is probably a finite-size effect since this\nfeature is less evident for Nx = 18 than for Nx = 12 (not shown).\nFig. 6 : LG56 model, data for three distinct isotherms, \u03b2 = 0.30, 0.34, and 0.38. Above:\nreduced number density \u03c1\u2217 ; below: \u03b2\u03bc derivative of \u03c1\u2217 . TM data for Nx = 18 (dotted\nlines) are contrasted with spline interpolants of the MC results for L \u00d7 L lattices, with\nL = 120, 180, and 240 (continuous lines). The MC density derivative is computed\nthrough the number fluctuations via Eq. (3.2) (the larger L, the more pronounced the\n\u2202\u03c1\u2217 /\u2202\u03b2\u03bc maximum is). While distinctly recording the freezing transition at all temperatures, a strip of 18 sites is not large enough to follow the boundary between vapor\nand liquid beyond a reduced temperature of 1/0.38. On the basis of the present MC\nevidence, it is hard to say whether the liquid-vapor boundary survives at all temperatures or it rather turns into a non-critical disorder line at a finite temperature (the\nscaling of the MC compressibility at the estimated transition point is inconclusive).\nFig. 7 : LG56 model, phase diagram on the T -\u03bc plane: TM results for Nx = 18 (open dots\nand continuous lines) plus three MC data points for a 240 \u00d7 240 lattice (asterisks),\ncorresponding to the location of the \u2202\u03c1\u2217 /\u2202\u03b2\u03bc maxima in Fig. 6.

It appears from the\ninset that the liquid-vapor transition either turns continuous at high temperatures or\nit becomes a crossover.\nFig. 8 : LG56 model, TM and MC data for the reduced number density \u03c1\u2217 and its \u03b2\u03bc\nderivative along the \u03bc = 8\u01eb line.

In the LG34\nmodel, these attractive sites are twelve, contributing a twofold degeneracy to the spatial orientation\nof solid B.\n\n24\n\n\fFIG. 2: LG34 model, TM results for Nx = 14. The reduced number density (dotted lines) and\nits \u03b2\u03bc derivative (continuous lines) are shown for three isotherms, \u03b2\u01eb = 0.75, 0.80, and 0.89. To\nhelp the eye, straight lines are drawn between data points. Peaks in the density derivative are\nthe imprint of phase boundaries: As a rule, the more pronounced a maximum is, the stronger\nthe phase transition. The confluence of three distinct phases (solid A, solid B, and liquid) at\n\u03b2\u01eb \u2248 0.90 is quite transparent from the behavior at \u03b2\u01eb = 0.89 (see also Fig. 3 inset). Upon raising\nthe temperature, the region of solid B gradually shrinks until its boundaries fade away. However,\nin the thermodynamic limit, there will reasonably be no path to go smoothly from fluid to solid B.\n\n25\n\n\fFIG. 3: LG34 model, TM results for Nx = 14. Overall phase diagram of the system as resulting\nfrom joining the (T, P ) points that correspond to \u2202\u03c1\u2217 /\u2202\u03b2\u03bc peaks. The LG34 potential (open dots\nand continuous lines) is contrasted with the LG3 repulsive law of Ref. [16] (Nx = 14, open squares\nand dashed lines). Spline interpolants drawn between LG34 data points mark first-order phase\nboundaries; the interruptions are finite-size effects. The fluid phase is vapor-like at low pressure\nand liquid-like at high pressure. While both models can exist in three phases (solid A, solid B, and\nfluid), LG34 is peculiar in that it shows a solid-solid transition with volume contraction on heating\nat constant pressure (inset).\n\n26\n\n\fFIG. 4: LG56 model, TM results for Nx = 18. The reduced number density (dotted lines) and its \u03b2\u03bc\nderivative (continuous lines) are shown for a number of isotherms, \u03b2\u01eb = 0.34, 0.38, 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, 0.6,\nand 0.7. To help the eye, straight lines are drawn between data points. MC data for a 18 \u00d7 360\nperiodic sample, relative to \u03b2\u01eb = 0.4, are also shown: Reduced number density (open dots) and\nits \u03b2\u03bc derivative (asterisks), as computed through the number fluctuations \u2013 see Eq. (3.2). Upon\nincreasing the temperature, the liquid-vapor peak progressively broadens till it disappears at \u03b2\u01eb =\n0.38. The solid-liquid peak is present at all temperatures: It is already very sharp for \u03b2\u01eb = 0.45,\nbecoming even sharper for lower temperatures (not shown).\n\n27\n\n\fFIG. 5: LG56 model, TM phase diagram for Nx = 12 (open triangles and dashed lines) and 18\n(open dots and continuous lines). The phase diagram of LG56 is contrasted with that of LG5\n(Nx = 18, open squares and dashed lines). Both models can exist in three phases: However, while\nthe dense phase of low pressure is solid B for the purely-repulsive LG5 model, the analogous phase\nfor LG56 is liquid, at least for high temperatures (see my arguments in Section 4.B). The LG56\nmodel is peculiar in that an inverse melting occurs (inset). The asterisk is a point on the solidliquid coexistence line of the wider LG56 strip that was constructed by MC (see main text). The\nshallow minimum in the solid-solid Pcox (T ) of LG5 is probably a finite-size effect since this feature\nis less evident for Nx = 18 than for Nx = 12 (not shown).\n\n28\n\n\fFIG. 6: LG56 model, data for three distinct isotherms, \u03b2 = 0.30, 0.34, and 0.38. Above: reduced\nnumber density \u03c1\u2217 ; below: \u03b2\u03bc derivative of \u03c1\u2217 . TM data for Nx = 18 (dotted lines) are contrasted\nwith spline interpolants of the MC results for L\u00d7L lattices, with L = 120, 180, and 240 (continuous\nlines). The MC density derivative is computed through the number fluctuations via Eq. (3.2) (the\nlarger L, the more pronounced the \u2202\u03c1\u2217 /\u2202\u03b2\u03bc maximum is). While distinctly recording the freezing\ntransition at all temperatures, a strip of 18 sites is not large enough to follow the boundary between\nvapor and liquid beyond a reduced temperature of 1/0.38. On the basis of the present MC evidence,\nit is hard to say whether the liquid-vapor boundary survives at all temperatures or it rather turns\ninto a non-critical disorder line at a finite temperature (the scaling of the MC compressibility at\nthe estimated transition point is inconclusive).\n\n29\n\n\fFIG. 7: LG56 model, phase diagram on the T -\u03bc plane: TM results for Nx = 18 (open dots and\ncontinuous lines) plus three MC data points for a 240 \u00d7 240 lattice (asterisks), corresponding to\nthe location of the \u2202\u03c1\u2217 /\u2202\u03b2\u03bc maxima in Fig. 6. A further dashed line connects TM data points for\nNx = 18 recording maxima of \u2202\u03c1\u2217 /\u2202\u03b2\u03bc along constant-\u03bc cuts. Inset: \u03b2\u03bc evolution (from left to\nright) in the range from 2.30 to 3.25, with steps of 0.05, of the density histogram for \u03b2 = 0.38 and\nL = 240. It appears from the inset that the liquid-vapor transition either turns continuous at high\ntemperatures or it becomes a crossover.\n\n30\n\n\fFIG. 8: LG56 model, TM and MC data for the reduced number density \u03c1\u2217 and its \u03b2\u03bc derivative\nalong the \u03bc = 8\u01eb line. TM data for Nx = 12 (dashed line) and Nx = 18 (dotted lines) are contrasted\nwith MC results for L \u00d7 L lattices, with L = 120 and 240 (continuous lines). The transition at\n\u03b2\u01eb \u2243 0.34 is from vapor to liquid while a defected solid B structure abruptly appeared when pushing\nthe simulation beyond \u03b2\u01eb = 0.40. Inset: \u03b2\u03bc evolution (from left to right) in the range from 0.3 to\n0.4, with steps of 0.005, of the density histogram for L = 240.\n\n31\n\n\fFIG. 9: LG56 model, phase boundaries on the T -\u03bc plane as been obtained from the TM data\n(Nx = 12: dashed lines; Nx = 18: open dots and continuous lines) and from exact low-temperature\nexpansions (full squares).
