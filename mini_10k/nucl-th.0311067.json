RMFT parameters\nThe Relativistic Mean Field Theory (RMFT) 1 , which is essentialy a Hartree-Fock\nlike method based on the Dirac equation for nucleons and the Klein-Gordon equation for the : \u03c1, \u03c9, \u03c3 mesons and photons, reproduces well the nuclear properties\nwhen its parameters (i.e.: masses of nucleons: m, mesons: m\u03c1 , m\u03c9 , m\u03c3 and their\ncoupling constants \u03c1\u03c1 , \u03c1\u03c9 , \u03c1\u03c3 , \u03c12 , \u03c13 ) are fitted to the largest possible amount of\nnuclear data. Usually the masses and mean square radii of 8 magic nuclei were used\nto find the RMFT parameters and several sets were established for various regions\nand quantities as: masses, barriers or radii. We have chequed the quality of three\nsets: NL1 2 , NL2 3 , NL3 4 by comparing their macroscopic energies obtained by\nsubtracting the Strutinsky shell correction, from the RMFT binding energies evaluated without pairing forces 5 with the Lublin-Strasbourg-Drop (LSD) energy 6 .\nThe minimization of the root mean square of the differences of macroscopic energy\nallowed to find the new set of RMFT parameters NL4, which even if rather close\nto the NL3, as can be seen on the table below, results in a rms deviation that is\nmore than 2 times better (7.17 MeV and 3.29 MeV respectively).\n\nSet\nNL3\nNL4\n\nm\n939\n938\n\nm\u03c9\n782.501\n782.474\n\nm\u03c1\n763.0\n763.9\n\nm\u03c3\n508.194\n508.194\n\ng\u03c9\n12.868\n12.867\n1\n\ng\u03c1\n\u20134.474\n\u20134.360\n\ng\u03c3\n10.217\n10.216\n\n\u03c12\n\u201310.431\n\u201310.432\n\n\u03c13\n\u201328.885\n\u201328.882\n\n\fAugust 3, 2018 10:37 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n2\n\nNL4new\n\nB.Nerlo- Pomorska, J.Sykut\n\n6\nexp\nNL4\nNL3\nD1S\n5.5\n208\n\n116\n\nrn [fm]\n\n5\n\nPb\n\nSn\n\n90\n\n4.5\n\nZr\n\n4\n\n124\n\nSn\n\n58\n\nNi\n\n52\n\nCr\n\n42\n\n44\n\nCa\n\nCa\n\n3.5\n46\n\nTi\n\n48\n\n50\n\nCa\n\nTi\n\n48\n\nTi\n\n40\n\nCa\n\n3\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n(N-Z)/A\n\nFig. 1.

Masses\nIn Fig. 3 the derivation of the theoretical and experimental masses obtained with\nthe RMFT for the NL3 and NL4 parameter sets of are compared with the Gogny\nD1S 7 Hartree-Fock-Bogolubov (HFB) results. As one can see the NL4 masses are\ncloser to the experimental data than NL3 ones, though they don't reach the high\nquality of the D1S Gogny force. The discrepancies in Fig. 3 are caused by the\napproximate treating of the pairing force. In RMFT model it is added by a BCS\nprocedure with the experimental pairing gaps as an input, while the HFB method\nincludes pairing correlations in the selfconsistent mean field.\n4. Conclusions\nThe following conclusions can be drawn from our calculation:\n1. We have shawn that the new RMFT NL4 parameters set reproduces the\ndata of spherical, even-even nuclei better than the previous ones like the\nD1S Gogny force.\n2.
