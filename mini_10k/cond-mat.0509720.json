The fixed points,\ntheir stability properties and the critical exponents are obtained and analyzed, using a\n\u01eb\u0303 = (4 \u2212 Deff )\u2013expansion near the effective spatial dimensionality Deff of the fluctuation\nmodes in D\u2013dimensional hyperslabs with two types of quenched impurities: point\u2013like\nimpurities with short\u2013range random correlations and extended (linear) impurities with\ninfinite\u2013range random correlations long the spatial direction of the small size. The difference between the critical properties of infinite systems and films is demonstrated and\ninvestigated. A new critical exponent, describing the scaling properties of the thickness\nof films with extended impurities has been deduced and calculated. A special attention\nis paid to the critical behaviour of real impure films (D = 3).\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe development of the theory of phase transitions in thin films in the last decades has\nbeen based mainly on statistical methods [1] such as, for example, the lattice mean\u2013field\n(MF) approximation [2, 3], the phenomenological Landau\u2013Ginzburg (LG) approach [4],\nthe general scaling theory [5, 6], and renormalization\u2013group (RG) schemes of calculation [7, 8]. The general approach to the description of finite\u2013size (FS) systems having\ndifferent geometries, including the film geometry, is the Fisher FS scaling theory [5, 6].\nWithin this framework the field\u2013theoretical RG methods are applied to the investigation\nof the possible types of critical behaviour and the calculation of important characteristics like the critical exponents, scaling amplitudes and crossover functions [7, 8]. The\ncalculations are performed for systems with a general spatial dimensionality D. The\npredictions for real systems (D = 3) are made by extrapolations from the corresponding\n\u01eb = (DU \u2212D)\u2013expansions, where DU is the upper critical dimensionality [9]). The method\nof \u01eb\u2013expansions is widely and successfully applied to the investigation of the critical properties of FS and infinite systems. It is proven to be particularly convenient for the study\nof complex models of real substances, where the competing effects play a substantial role.\nFor FS systems one of the most interesting problems is the dimensional FS crossover (FSC)\nfrom the usual D\u2013dimensional critical behaviour to the corresponding d = (D \u2212 D0 )\u2013\ndimensional critical behaviour when the finite sizes L0i (i = 1, ..., D0 ) are less than the\ncorrelation length \u03be \u223c (T \u2212 Tc )\u2212\u03bd ; Tc is the critical temperature [5, 7]. As \u03be \u2192 \u221e for\nT \u2192 Tc , the FSC (D \u2192 d) in the asymptotic critical behaviour occurs always provided the\nnumber d of \"infinite\" dimensions Li \u226b \u03be, (i = 1, ..., d) is larger than the lower borderline\n(critical) dimensionality DL [9].\nIn this paper we shall study the FSC in D\u2013dimensional hyperfilms (D0 = 1, d = D \u2212 1)\nof thickness L0 with quenched random impurities and inhomogeneities [9, 10], which can\nbe described by a properly chosen \u03c64 \u2013model of critical phenomena with an n\u2013component\nfluctuation field (order parameter) \u03c6(x) = {\u03c6\u03b1 (~x), \u03b1 = 1, ..., n}. A special attention will\nbe paid to the case of real films (D = 3). Thus we shall investigate a complex system\nwith three competing effects: the thermal fluctuations, the FS, and the disorder. The\nmain features of the critical behaviour in such complex systems can be described by the\nWilson\u2013Fisher RG recursion relations in the one\u2013loop approximation [9]. The one\u2013loop\napproximation leads to a reliable prediction of the possible types of critical behaviour,\nnamely, of the fixed points (FP) of the RG equations, their stability properties, and of\nthe first corrections to the MF values of the critical exponents. We shall perform this\nprogramme for basic models of random impurities by introducing a new approach to the\nRG investigation of the FS effects.\nThe RG investigations of films reveal the two limiting cases of the FSC: (i) thick (quasi\u2013\nD\u2013dimensional) films, where the ratio y = (L0 /\u03be) tends to infinity (y \u226b 1), and (ii)\nthin (quasi\u2013d\u2013dimensional) films, where the ratio y tends to zero (y \u226a 1). In the former\n2\n\n\fcase the upper borderline dimensionality is DU = 4, whereas in the latter case this\ndimensionality is DU = 5 [7, 8]. The \u01eb\u2013expansions for the cases (i) and (ii) are performed\nfor \u01eb = (5 \u2212 D) = (4 \u2212 d) and \u01eb = (4 \u2212 D) = (3 \u2212 d), respectively. Here we shall present\nan unified RG investigation based on an \u01eb\u0303 = (4 \u2212 Deff )\u2013expansion, where Deff \u2208 [d, D]\nis the effective dimensionality of the fluctuation modes \u03c6(~x) [11]. For this aim we shall\napply the so\u2013called integration over dimensionalities \u03b4(= Deff \u2212 d) less than unity. This\napproach has been recently used to perform a \u03b4 \u2264 1\u2013integration over the time axis for\nproblems of the quantum critical behaviour in disordered superfluids [12]. Working in a\nsimilar way one may obtain a description of the critical behaviour in impure thin films\nfor any effective spatial dimensionality Deff \u2208 [d, D].\nThe term effective spatial dimensionality (Deff ) has been recently introduced [11] in an\nattempt for a description of the FSC as a smooth variation of the effective dimensionality\nof the fluctuation modes \u03c6(~x) with the variations of the ratio y = (L0 /\u03be). Although the\nprecise dependence Deff (y) cannot be easily obtained, it seems intuitively obvious that in\nthin films Deff (y) \u223c d for y \u226a 1 (the case of thin films) and Deff (y) \u223c D = (d + 1) for\ny \u226b 1 (the case of thick films or, equivalently, of almost infinite systems).\nThe random impurities and inhomogeneities produce the effect of \"random critical temperature\" Tc (~x) which depends on the spatial vector ~x [9, 10, 13, 14]. This type of\n(nonequilibrium, quenched) disorder is investigated by choosing a convenient, usually,\nGaussian distribution for the random (nonequilibrium) temperature Tc (~x). The critical behaviour of infinite systems both for point [13] and extended [14] impurities is well\nknown; see also [9, 10]. We consider the FS effect on the critical behaviour in films with\nthese basic types of disorder.\nWithin the model of point impurities with spatially isotropic short\u2013range random correlations the FSC (D \u2192 d) can be easily proven. Besides, we demonstrate that the critical\nexponents are smooth functions of Deff and, hence, of the ratio y = (L0 /\u03be). We shall show\nthat the impure critical behaviour predicted by predicted by T. C. Lubensky [13] for infinite systems with point impurities occurs in thin films for any effective dimensionality\nDeff > 2, i.e. for any ratio y = (L0 /\u03be).\nThe disorder of type extended impurities is described by infinitely\u2013ranged random correlations along one or more spatial directions. For systems of a film geometry the appropriate\nchoice of extended impurities is the case of one\u2013dimensional (line) impurities orientated\nalong the direction of the small size L0 and randomly distributed along the other spatial directions. This disorder is described b a modification of the model of short\u2013range\ncorrelated point impurities in which the short\u2013range correlations along the small size are\nsubstituted with infinite\u2013range correlations. The length scale of the latters is much larger\nthan both the correlation length \u03be and the thickness L0 . So the strongly correlated along\nthe small size point impurities behave like continuous uniform strings. In regards to the\ncritical behaviour this disorder acts like point impurities with a short\u2013range random distribution along the large (infinite) dimensions Li and an uniform distribution along the\n3\n\n\fsmall size L0 . The anisortopy of the random correlations lead to a quite unusual critical\nbehaviour of the impure films. This behaviour is described in details. As a result of\nour analysis, we have identifies a new critical exponent describing the scaling law of the\nthickness L0 of the film. This exponent is analogous to the dynamical critical exponent z\nin disordered classical [15] and quantum systems [16].\nIn Section 2 we present the model of consideration. The specific FS features of the\nmodel are discussed in Section 3. The integration in dimensionalities less than unity\nand the effective dimensionality Deff are introduced in Section 4. The RG investigations\npresented in Sections 5 and 6 rely upon the basic problems discussed in Section 3 and\n4. In Section 7 we summarize the results and discuss their applicability to real three\u2013\ndimensional (3D) films. The analogy between the FSC in thin films and the classical\u2013to\u2013\nquantum crossover [17] at low temperatures is also disenssed.\n\n2\n\nModel\n\nWe shall use the usual \u03c64 \u2013Hamiltonian (H = H/T, kB = 1) of the n\u2013component fluctuation field \u03c6(~x). We shall stick to the usual notations [9, 10, 13] in which the Hamiltonian\nH can be written in the form\n1\nH=\n2\n\nZ\n\nn\n\ndD x (\u2207\u03c6)2 + r(~x)\u03c62 + 2u\u03c64\n\no\n\n.\n\n(1)\n\nIn Eq. (1), u > 0, r(~x) = r + \u03c6(~x), where \u03c6(~x) is a random function intended to describe\nthe disorder effects and r = \u03b10 (T \u2212Tc0 )/Tc0 is the usual Landau parameter represented by\nthe (bare) critical temperature Tc0 of the pure systems [\u03c6(~x) \u2261 0]. The random function\n\u03c6(~x) obeys the Gaussian distribution [9, 10]:\n[\u03c6(~x)\u03c6(~x\u2032 )]R = \u2206\u03b4(~x \u2212 ~x\u2032 ) ,\n\n(2)\n\n(\u2206 \u2265 0). The function \u03c6(~x) is related to the \"random\" critical temperature Tc0 (~x) in the\nfollowing way: Tc0 (~x) = Tc0 [1 \u2212 \u03c6(~x)/\u03b10 ]. The true (renormalized) critical temperature\nTc will be a function of Tc0 and the renormalized values of the interaction parameters u\nand \u2206. The averages hAiR of the physical quantities A[\u03c6(~x)] are defined by the functional\nintegral\nZ Y\nR D 2\n1\nD\u03c6(~x)e\u2212 2\u2206 d x\u03c6 (~x) A [\u03c6(~x)] .\nhAiR =\n(3)\n~\nx\n\nWe shall work with periodic boundary conditions. This means that we neglect the surface\nenergy which is important in the investigation of other properties of thin films. This way\nof treatment gives the opportunity to investigate the net effect of the FS L0 on the critical\nbehaviour of the impure films.\nThe RG investigation is performed in the space of the wave vectors. Taking into account\nthe lattice structure, the components q\u03bd of the D\u2013dimensional wave vector q~ = (q\u03bd ; \u03bd =\n4\n\n\f0, 1, ..., d) are confined in the first Brillouin zone (\u2212\u03c0/a < q\u03bd \u2264 \u03c0/a). However, because\nof the long\u2013wavelength approximation (LWLA), aq\u03bd \u226a \u03c0, which is unavoidably included\nin field models like the Hamiltonian (1), the upper cutoff \u039b of the wave vector ~q is much\nsmaller than (\u03c0/a), namelly, \u039b = \u03b3(\u03c0/a), where \u03b3 \u226a 1. While the LWLA approximation\ndoes not introduce restrictions on the dimensions Li which are initially supposed to be\nalmost infinite (Li \u226b \u03be for any a < \u03be < \u221e), the same approximation restricts the\nvariations of the thickness: a \u226a L0 . Therefore our consideration is confined within the\nlatter condition and our results could not be extended to exactly two\u2013dimensional (2D)\nfilms (mono\u2013atomic layers). It is convenient to write the D\u2013dimensional wave vector ~q\nin the form ~q = (k0 , ~k), where the wave number k0 = (2\u03c0n0 /L0 ) with n0 = 0, \u00b11, ...,\ncorresponds to the thickness L0 , and the d\u2013dimensional wave vector ~k with components\nki = (2\u03c0ni /Li ), (ni = 0, \u00b11, ...,) corresponds to the d\u2013dimensional \"subsystem\" of the\nfilm.\nThe short\u2013range random correlations (2) correspond to point\u2013like random impurities and\ninhomogeneities which are equally distrubuted along all D directions. In the space of the\nwave vectors ~q the Eq. (2) takes the form\n[\u03c6(~q)\u03c6(~q \u2032 ]R = \u2206\u03b4(~q, ~q \u2032 ) ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b4(x, y) is the Kronecker symbol. The disorder of type \"extended impurities\" is\ndescribed by the Gaussian distribution given by\n[\u03c6(~r)\u03c6(~r \u2032 )]R = \u2206\u03b4(~r \u2212 ~r \u2032 ) ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the vector ~r lays in the d\u2013dimensional subsystem; as given by the definition ~x by\n~x = (x0 , ~r). In the q\u2013space, the Eq. (5) takes the form\n[\u03c6(~k)\u03c6(~k \u2032 )]R = \u2206\u03b4(~k, ~k \u2032 ) ,\n\n(6)\n\n[\u03c6(~q)\u03c6(~q \u2032 )]R = \u2206\u03b4(~k, ~k \u2032 )\u03b4(0, ~k0 )\u03b4(0, ~k0\u2032 ) .\n\n(7)\n\nor, equivalently,\nThese models of impure systems have been briefly explained in Section 1. Besides, they\nare described well in several preceding papers [10, 13] and we shall not enter in more\ndetails.\n\n3\n\nFilm geometry and FSC\n\nIn order to clarify the application of the Hamiltonian (1) to FS systems we shall consider\nsimple lattice sums which appear in the one\u2013loop perturbation contributions to the \"self\u2013\nenergy\" parameter r and the interaction constant u:\nAm (r) =\n\n1 X\nSm (k, r) ,\nVd ~\nk\n\n5\n\n(8)\n\n\fwhere m = 1, 2, ..., k = |~k|, Vd = (L1 , ..., Ld ) = VD /L0 , and\nSm (k, r) =\n\n1\n1 X\n.\n2\nL0 k0 (k0 + k 2 + r)m\n\n(9)\n\nIn a close vicinity of the critical point Tc , where r = \u03be \u22122 \u223c 0, the upper cutoff \u039b for the\nwave vector ~q can be ignored and the sums (8) and (9) over ~k and k0 can be extended\nto infinity because the essential contributions to these sums are given only by the small\nwave numbers (0 \u223c q 2 \u223c \u03be \u22122 ). As we are interested in the critical behaviour in a close\nvicinity of the critical point, where \u03be \u226b a, the essential contribution to the sums Sm and\nAm will be given by the terms with wave numbers q\u03bd \u2264 \u03be and therefore we must choose\nthe cutoff \u039b\u03be > 1. This is consistent with the LWLA provided (a/\u03be) < \u03b3 \u226a 1. Under\nthe latter conditions the cutoff \u039b can be kept finite or set infinite without any effect on\nthe results of the summation. As we shall apply the Wilson\u2013Fisher RG method, it seems\nconvenient to keep the cutoff \u039b for the wave vectors ~k and neglect the upper cutoff for the\nwave numbers k0 . It is important to keep in mind that our investigation of the critical\nbehaviour of slabs is valid only for\n\u03be\u039b \u226b 1 ,\n\nL0 \u226b a .\n\n(10)\n\nWhile the ~k\u2013summation in Eq. (8) can be always replaced by a ~k\u2013integration, the summation (9) over the wave vector component k0 can be transformed to an integration\nonly if certain conditions are satisfied. The latter become clear from the result of the\nsummation (9) over k0 \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) for m = 1:\n\"\n\nL0\ny(k)\nS1 (k, r) =\ncth\n2y(k)\n2\n\n#\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere y(k) = L0 (k 2 + r)1/2 . For y(k) \u226a 1, S1 from (11) coincides with the (k0 = 0)\u2013term\nin (9). In this case, the D\u2013dimensional film has a d = (D \u2212 1) dimensional behaviour.\nThe quantity y(k) is much less than unity for any k only if (L0 \u039b) \u226a 1 and y(0) \u2261 y =\n(L0 /\u03be) \u226a 1. These conditions are consistent with (10) provided a \u226a L0 \u226a (1/\u039b). The\ncondition (L0 \u039b) \u226a 1 is satisfied in a broad interval of values L0 > a because of the fact\nthat \u039b \u226a (\u03c0/a). Moreover, having in mind that the small values of the wave number k\nyield the essential contribution in the sums Am one may consider the condition L0 \u226a \u03be\ninstead of (L0 \u039b) \u226a 1. This new condition for y(k) \u226a 1 is weaker than (L0 \u039b) \u226a 1.\nTherefore, the limiting case y(k) \u223c 0 does not necessarily correspond to an exactly two\u2013\ndimensional (2D) film (a single atomic layer; L0 = a). Rather, we have shown that the\nexactly 2D films are beyond the scope of the LWLA and that one of the main limiting\ncases of our consideration is the quasi\u2013 2D film defined by a \u226a L0 \u226a (1/\u039b).\nThe second limiting case is given by y(k) \u226b 1. The cases y(k) \u226a 1 and y(k) \u226b 1 are\noften referred to as the limits y(k) \u2192 0 and y(k) \u2192 \u221e, respecticely. For y(k) \u2192 \u221e,\nthe Eq. (11) yields a result that can be obtained by replacing the sum S1 by an integral\n6\n\n\fover k0 , namely, by taking the continuum limit along the small size L0 . This corresponds\nto a D\u2013dimensional behaviour of the system when all summations over the wave vector\ncomponents q\u03bd can be substituted with an integration over the vector ~q. The quantity\ny(k) tends to infinity for any k only if y \u2192 \u221e. Thus our film is quasi\u20133D for all L0 \u226b \u03be.\nThe behaviour of the sum S1 in the two limiting cases y(k) \u2192 0 and y(k) \u2192 \u221e exhibits\nthe dimensional FSC: d \u2192 D = (d + 1). Having in mind that Am+1 = \u2212(\u2202Am /\u2202r),\nm = 1, 2, ..., we see that this dimensional crossover is a property of all perturbation terms\nand, hence of the system as a whole.\nThe present discussion is particularly important for RG studies of the FSC, where the\nperturbation integrals are calculated at r = 0. In such studies the asymptotics of the\ncorresponding integrands are considered and, therefore, one must be sure that the product\nkL0 can reach the limiting values (kL0 ) \u226a 1 and (kL0 ) \u226b 1 within the limitations (10) [8].\nThe RG integrals are given by taking the continuum limit for the summation over ~k in (8)\nand by confining the integration in the limits k \u2208 [\u039b/b, \u039b], where b > 1 is the RG\nrescaling number. For such integrals with a lower cutoff \u039b/b the condition (\u039bL0 ) \u226b b\nfor thick (almost\u20133D) films at the critical point (r = 0) is satisfied for L0 \u226b (ba/\u03b3\u03c0).\nThe condition for thin (quasi\u2013 2D) films is (\u039bL0 ) \u226a 1 and, together with a \u226a L0 , we\nhave a \u226a L0 \u226a (a/\u03b3\u03c0). All these conditions are consistent within the LWLA and the\nrequirement for a criticality as given by inequalities (10).\nTherefore the RG investigations are consistent with both the aims and the model chosen in\nthis paper. The behaviour of the exactly 2D films is beyond the scope of our consideration\nbut we can reliably investigate the FSC from quasi\u20133D to quasi\u20132D films.\n\n4\n\nIntegration in noninteger dimensionalities\n\nAn obvious disadvantage of all existing descriptions of the FSC and other dimensional\ncrossovers [17] is that the limiting cases can be easily proven and described but the\nintermediate case (0 < y < 1) presents a difficult and unresolved task. The systematic\nway of investigation of the intermediate cases (y \u223c 1) is to use the Euler\u2013Maclaurin\nsummation formula and take into account the corrections in inverse powers of y(k) to the\ncontinuum limit. Such a treatment requires a numerical analysis. Alternatively, one may\nperform the RG studies by an integration in noninteger dimensionalities. In this Section\nwe shall discuss the advantages and the disadvantages of this method. We shall show that\nit can be applied as an interpolation between the limiting cases y \u226a 1 and y \u226b 1 only to\nspecific theoretical schemes such as the RG.\n\n7\n\n\f4.1\n\n\u03b4\u2013integration\n\nLet us consider the integral\nA1 (r, b) = L0\n\nZ\n\ndd k cth[y(k)/2]\n,\n(2\u03c0)d 2y(k)\n\n(12)\n\nwhich follows from (8) and (11). The integrand S1 (k, r) exhibits a single\u2013power behaviour\n[\u223c y \u03c3 (k)] only for y(k) \u226a 1 and y(k) \u226b 1. The existence of a leading power dependence\n\u221a\nof the integrals Am+1 = \u2212(\u2202Am /\u2202r) on y = (L0 r) and the irrelevanve of the correction\nterms lead to a simple structure of the RG equations and, hence, to their scale invariant\nsolutions, which are important for the description of the critical behaviour. The problem\nis to achieve such solutions for the intermediate cases of y \u223c 1, too.\nIt is impossible to construct an exact integral counterpart of the Eq. (12) with a power law\nbehaviour with respect to y and for this reason, here we shall consider an approximate\nsolution of the problem. We shall substitute the sum S1 (k, r) with the \u03b4\u2013dimensional\nintegral\nZ\nd\u03b4 x\n1\nS1\u2032 = L0\u03b4\u22121\n.\n(13)\n(2\u03c0)\u03b4 (x2 + k 2 + r)\nAccordingly, the integral (12) will be substituted by the double (\u03b4, d)\u2013dimensional integral\nA\u20321 (r, b)\n\n=\n\nL0\u03b4\u22121\n\nZ\n\n1\ndd k Z d\u03b4 x\n.\nd\n\u03b4\n2\n(2\u03c0)\n(2\u03c0) (x + k 2 + r)\n\n(14)\n\nThe alternative is to substitute the integral (12) with the (d + \u03b4)\u2013dimensional integral\nA\u2032\u20321 (r, b) = L0\u03b4\u22121\n\nZ\n\n1\ndd+\u03b4 q\n,\n(2\u03c0)d+\u03b4 (q 2 + r)\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03b4 \u2208 [0, 1]. Certainly, these substitutions are not exact counterparts of the original\nquantities and their utility in our attempts to present a reliable interpolation between the\nlimiting cases should be justified.\nThe integral (15) can be deduced after the conjecture that the wave vector component\nk0 is a \u03b4(< 1)\u2013dimensional (sub)vector, ~k0 = (k\u03bc0 ; \u03bc = 1, ..., \u03b4) and, accordingly, that the\ntotal wave vector ~q = {k\u03bc0 ; ki } and the volume VD = L\u03b4 Vd in the sum (8) correspond to a\n(d + \u03b4)\u2013dimensional system [11, 12, 14]. The integrals A\u2032\u20321 and A\u2032\u2032(m+1) = \u2212(\u2202A\u2032\u2032m /\u2202r) have\nbeen used in preceding studies of quantum systems [12] and extended impurities [14] for\nboth \u03b4 > 1 and \u03b4 < 1.\nThe integrals S1\u2032 and A\u2032(m+1) = \u2212(\u2202A\u2032m /\u2202r) given by (13) and (14) are defined with the\nhelp of another conjecture, namely, that one may perform a smooth interpolation between\nthe integral values in the continuum limits (\u03b4 = 0) and \u03b4 = 1 for the d\u2013 and D = (d + 1)\u2013\ndimensional cases, respectively, with the help of the formal rule\nZ\nZ \u221e\nd\u03b4 x\n1 X\ndx.x\u03b4\u22121 ,\n\u2192\n\u2261\nK\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\nL0 k0\n(2\u03c0)\n0\n\n8\n\n(16)\n\n\fwhere K\u03b4 = 21\u2212\u03b4 /\u03c0 \u03b4/2 \u0393(\u03b4/2). Using (8), (9) and (16) one immediately obtains the integrals (13) and (14). The limit \u03b4 \u2192 0 in the last integral (in spherical coordinates)\nin (16) should be taken with a special attention because of the divergency of the gamma\nfunction \u0393(\u03b4/2). At first one should perform the integration over x of the integrand,\nsay, x+0 f (x)/x, and then to take the limit \u03b4 \u2192 0. Usually, the integrands [\u223c f (x)]\nwhich appear by the perturbation series are such that no divergences arise in the final\nresults for \u03b4 \u223c 0. This is confirmed by a direct calculation of the integrals (13), (14) and\nA\u2032m+1 = \u2212(\u2202A\u2032m /\u2202r).\nFor \u03b4 \u2192 0 and \u03b4 \u2192 1, the integrals (13) and (14) exactly reproduce the results from (11)\nand (12) for y \u2192 0 and y \u2192 \u221e, respectively. The same is valid for the integral (15) with\nrespect to Eq. (12). So there are some grounds for the supposition that the intermediate\nstates (y \u223c 1) could be interpolated by the values 0 < \u03b4 < 1.\n\n4.2\n\nEffective dimensionality of the fluctuation modes\n\nThe coincidence of the results for the original integrals Am (r) in the limits y \u2192 0 and\ny \u2192 \u221e with the results from the integrals A\u2032m and A\u2032\u2032m could be used as a basis of the\nsupposition that there exists a continuous increasing function \u03b4(y) with the properties\n\u03b4(y \u2192 0) \u2192 0 and \u03b4(y \u2192 \u221e) \u2192 1. This supposition presents the opportunity to\nintruduce a new dimensionality \u2013 the spatial dimensionality of the fluctuation modes \u03c6(~q)\ngiven by\nDeff (y) = d + \u03b4(y) .\n(17)\nThe Eq. (17) is a straightforward generalization of the known (from previous FS studies [7, 8]) fact that the FS system abruptly changes its D\u2013dimensional behaviour to the\ncorresponding d\u2013dimensional behaviour when the thickness L0 is lowered to values less\nthan \u03be. According to the model (1), the system is represented by the field \u03c6(~x). In this\nrespect the notion for the effective length Deff is not new but in this Section we consider\nit more explicitly within the generalized form given by Eq. (17). Besides, in Section 5\n(U )\nand 6 we shall introduce an \u01eb\u0303 = (Deff \u2212 Deff )\u2013expansion around the upper borderline\n(U )\neffective dimensionality Deff . In general, this is a way to describe the RG scaling in\nterms of the fundamental ratio y = (L0 /\u03be). Unfortunately, the present investigation does\nnot give an opportunity to obtain the function \u03b4(y) and, hence, Deff (y). The reason is in\nthe pecuriality of the approach based on the \u03b4\u2013integrations introduced in Section 4.1.\n\n4.3\n\nValidity\n\nAlthough the formal difference in their definitions, the integrals A\u2032m (r) and A\u2032\u2032m lead to\nthe same results in many practical calculations. An example of such a calculation will be\npresented in this Section; for other examples, see Sections 5 and 6. The problem is that\nthe values of the original sum (11) and integral (12) do not coincide with the values of the\n9\n\n\fcorresponding integrals in noninteger dimensinalities (\u03b4 6= 0). Therefore, the application\nof the integration in noninteger dimensionalities to concrete problems requires a special\nattention. The relaibility of such applications should be justified for any particular case.\nDespite the numerous RG studies which have been already performed with the help of\nthe integrals A\u2032\u2032m , the question about the limitations of the corresponding results has not\nbeen considered. In order to justify our RG investigations in Sections 5 and 6, we shall\nconsider this problem. Besides, we shall demonstrate the degree of the approximation by\ncompating the original sum S1 (k, y) and integral A1 (y), denoting them as functions of y,\nwith the corresponding integrals S1\u2032 (k, y), A\u20321 (y), and A\u2032\u20321 (y).\nBy calculating the integral (13) for S1\u2032 and by comparing the result with S1 from (11) we\nobtain\n(18)\nth[y(k)/2] \u2194 g\u03b4 [y(k)]\nwith\n\"\n\ny(k)\ng\u03b4 [y(k)] = A(\u03b4)\n2\n\n#1\u2212\u03b4\n\n,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere A(\u03b4) = \u03c0 \u03b4/2 /\u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b4/2); hereafter the symbol \"\u2194\" will denote a \"comparison\"\nand nothing else. The comparison (18) can be done for any k < \u039b. For k = 0, we have\n\u221a\n\u221a\ny(0) = y, for k\u03be = 1, y(1/\u03be) = 2, and for a third wave number k\u03be = 3, which also\n\u221a\nhas an essential contribution in the integrals over ~k, we have y( 3/\u03be) = 1. As we shall\nsee our approximations are not precise enough in order to distinguish between the fits\nof S1 and S1\u2032 for different wave numbers. Besides, there is a strong argument that the\nmost important value of k at which we should make the comparison (18) is k = 0. This\nvalue corresponds to the uniform mode \u03c6(~k = 0) describing the spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking in the d\u2013dimensional subsystem.\nBy setting k = 0 in (18) and (19) we have\nth(y/2) \u2194 A(\u03b4)\n\n\u0012 \u00131\u2212\u03b4\n\ny\n2\n\n.\n\n(20)\n\nThe l.h.s and the r.h.s. of (20) are depicted in Fig. 1. From one side it is obvious that\nS1\u2032 (0, y) is a good approximation to S1 (0, y) in quite broad intervals of values of y, for\nexample: 0 < y(k) < 1 and y(k) > 4. From the other side, it becomes evident that the\nvalues of \u03b4 that give the best fit of S \u2032 (0, y) to S(0, y) are: \u03b4 = 0 \u2013 for the case y < 1, and\n\u03b4 = 1 \u2013 for the case y \u226b 1. This means that, within the present consideration, the function\n\u03b4(y) can be approximated with zero for all y < 1 corresponding to a relatively good fit of\nthe curves th(y/2) and g\u03b4 (y) and that, owing to the same arguments, \u03b4(y) \u2248 1 for y \u226b 2.\nIn a broad region of values y around y = 2 the approximation of S(0, y) \u223c S \u2032 (0, y) breaks\ndown and we could not deduce any reliable conclision about the exact critical value yc\nof y at which the FSC occurs. According to the present picture one may speculate that\nthis value is probably yc = 2 whereas the intuitively appealing value is y = 1. The value\nyc = 2 comes from the factor (1/2) in the front of y(k) in Eqs. (18), (19), and (20). The\npicture outlined from the comparison (20) is valid for the comparison denoted in (19).\n10\n\n\f\u221a\nIn this case one should change y with y(k). For k = ( 3/\u03be), yc = 1, and the points of\nintersection of g\u03b4 \u2013lines will be located around the coordinate yc = 1.\nThe calculculations within the present approach yield that the locations of the minimal\nvalues of the difference between the r.h.s. and the l.h.s. of (20) are \u03b4 = 0 for all y < 2 and\n\u03b4 = 1 for all y > 1, namely, that \u03b4(y) coincides with the \u0398\u2013function \u0398(y \u2212 2). Certainly\nthis qualitatively wrong result is due to the obvious fact, see Fig. 1, that in a broad region\naround the point yc = 2, the approximation of S1 (0, y) to S1\u2032 (0, y) is not valid. It can be\nhowever concluded from such rough considerations that the real function \u03b4(y) will have\na steep increase from very small values \u03b4 \u223c 0 up to \u03b4 \u223c 1 in a relatively close vicinity\n(|y \u2212 yc | \u223c yc ) of the real critical point yc .\nThe comparison of the integral A1 (r) with A\u20321 (r) and A\u2032\u20321 (r) is more difficult. In order to\navoid the cutoff (\u039b\u2013) dependence of the results and simultaneously to avoid irrelevant to\nour problem ultraviolet divergences we shall set \u039b = \u221e and consider the differences of\ntype \u2206A1 (y) = [A1 (0) \u2212 A1 (y)] rather than the integrals themselves. Using Eq. (12) we\nobtain\n1\n\u2206A1 (y) = Kd L1\u2212d\n(21)\n0 Id (y)\n2\nwith\n#\n\"\n\u221a\nZ \u221e\ncth( z 2 + y 2/2)\nd\u22121 cth(z/2)\n\u221a 2\n\u2212\nId (y) =\n,\n(22)\ndz z\nz\nz + y2\n0\nwhere z = L0 k. The difference \u2206A\u20321 (y) = [A\u20321 (0) \u2212 A\u20321 (y)] is obtained from Eqs. (8)\nand (14):\n\u2032\n\u2206A\u20321 (y) = A(\u03b4)Kd L1\u2212d\n(23)\n0 Jd (\u03b4, y) ,\nwhere\nJd\u2032 (\u03b4, y)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndz z\n\n0\n\nd\u22121\n\n\"\n\n1\nz 2\u2212\u03b4\n\n1\n\u2212 2\n(z + y 2)1\u2212\u03b4/2\n\n#\n\n.\n\n(24)\n\nFinally, from Eqs. (8) and (15) we have that the difference [A\u2032\u20321 (0) \u2212 A\u2032\u20321 (y)] is given by\n2\n\u2206A\u2032\u20321 (y) = Kd+\u03b4 L1\u2212d\n0 y\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndz\n\nz d+\u03b4\u22123\n.\nz2 + y2\n\n(25)\n\nThe integrals (22), (24) and (25) have obvious ultraviolet and infrared divergences at the\ncorresponding lower and upper borderline dimensionalities. In order to avoid unnecessary\ncomplications in our calculation we shall consider the case of real films (d = 2).\nFor (d = 2) the Eqs. (25) becomes\n\u2206A\u2032\u20321 (y)\n\nA(\u03b4)\n=\n2\u03c0L0\n\ny\u03b4\n\u03b4\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(26)\n\nBecause of the obvious infrared divergence at \u03b4 = 0, we shall consider the derivative\n(\u2202\u2206A\u2032\u20321 /\u2202y) instead of the difference \u2206A\u2032\u20321 itself:\nA(\u03b4)y \u03b4\u22121\n\u2202\u2206A\u2032\u20321 (y)\n=\n.\n\u2202y\n2\u03c0L0\n11\n\n(27)\n\n\fThe ultraviolet divergences in the two parts of the integral J2\u2032 (\u03b4, y) are exactly compensated each other and this integral takes the simple form J2\u2032 (\u03b4, y) = y \u03b4 /\u03b4. Thus we obtain\nthat the derivative of \u2206A\u20321 (y) is equal to the derivative (27). The integral \u2202I2 (y)/\u2202y can\nbe represented in the form\n\u2202I2 (y)\n=y\n\u2202y\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\ny\n\n1\ncth(t/2)\n+\ndt\n2\n2\nt\n2tsh (t/2)\n\n!\n\n(28)\n\nwhich directly yields the result cth(y/2). For d = 2, the derivative of the difference\n\u2206A1 (y) becomes\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\ny\n\u2202A1 (y)\ncth\n.\n(29)\n=\n\u2202y\n4\u03c0L0\n2\nThe correspondence (20) straingtforwardly follows from the comparison of the Eqs. (27)\nand (29).\nThus we have shown that the derivatives of the integrals A\u2032m and A\u2032\u2032m are quite different\nthe derivatives of the original integrals Am , in particular for y \u223c yc . Having in mind that\nthe values of all integrals coincide at the limiting points \u03b4(y = 0) = 0 and \u03b4(y = \u221e) = 1,\nthe same conclusion is true for the integrals themselves.\nThe demonstrated deviation of the integrals in noninteger dimensionalities from the initial\nintegrals Am does not mean that the RG analysis based on them is unreliable for 0 < \u03b4 < 1.\nThe argument here is that the RG predictions about the critical behaviour follow from\nthe RG transformation which reflects the structure and the symmetry of the Hamiltonian\nrather than from the values of the perturbation integrals. The latters determine the\nlocation of the fixed points (FPs) of the RG equations and, therefore, might be of interest\nonly in problems of special interest as to the question of whether a particular stable FP\nis accessible by the RG flows or not. For such special questions which often arise in\ninvestigations of complex systems the wrong determination of the FP coordinates, given\nby the integrals A\u2032m or A\u2032\u2032m , may produce wrong conclusions. Hopefully, our RG analysis\nin the next two Sections do not come upon such problems and we can arrive at reliable\npredictions about the critical behaviour of impure films irrespectively on the incorrest\npredictions about the location of the FPs.\nIn Sections 5 and 6 we shall perform the RG investigation with the help of the integrals\nA\u2032m . This more difficult variant is chosen to demonstrate that the results do not depend\non the particular scheme of calculation.\n\n5\n\nRG analysis: short\u2013range impurity correlations\n\nThe conventional RG treatment of the FSC has been presented in details in preceding\nworks [7, 8], where the perturbation integrals Am have been calculated by a direct summations over k0 ; see, e.g. Eqs. (11) and (12). We shall show that the application of\nthe integration in noninteger dimensionalities yields more information about the critical\n12\n\n\fproperties of films than the standard RG treatment of FS systems. For this aim we shall\nuse the double (\u03b4, d)\u2013integration.\nThe RG recursion relations can be derived in two equivalent ways: by introducing an initial\nrescaling of the wave vector component k0 and without such an initial rescaling [7, 8]. We\nchoose the latter variant in which the rescaling of the wave number k0 or, equivalently, of\nthe thickness L0 \u223c (1/k0 ), will appear as a result of the RG transformation. The initial\nrescaling transformations are ki\u2032 = bki and\n\u03c6\u03b1 (k0 , b\u22121~k) = b1\u2212\u03b7/2 \u03c6\u2032\u03b1 (k0 , ~k) ,\n\n(30)\n\nwhere b > 1 is the rescaling number. In our investigation within the one\u2013loop approximation the Fisher exponent \u03b7 is equal to zero. The calculations are carried out by the\ndirect way [9, 13] of the averaging of the random functions.\nUsing the standard way of calculations we have derived the RG recursion relations for\nshort\u2013range correlated point impurities (4) in the form\nL\u20320 = b\u22121 L0 ,\n\n(31)\n\nr \u2032 = b2 {r + [4(n + 2)u \u2212 \u2206]A\u20321 (r, b)} ,\n\n(32)\n\nu\u2032 = b3\u2212d {u \u2212 [4(n + 8)u2 \u2212 6u\u2206]A\u20322 (0, b)} ,\n\n(33)\n\n\u2206\u2032 = b3\u2212d {\u2206 \u2212 [8(n + 2)u\u2206 \u2212 4\u22062 ]A\u20322 (0, b)} ,\n\n(34)\n\nwhere the integrals A\u2032m (r, b) are the continuum limits of the sums (8) with the upper\ncutoff \u039b = 1 and an lower cutoff b\u22121 ; hereafter we shall omit the (\u2032 ) of these integrals.\nThe calculation of the integrals to first order in the small parameter r at the upper\n(U )\nborderline dimensionality [Deff = (d + \u03b4)U = 4] yields:\nA1 (r, b) = A1 (0, b) \u2212 A2 (0.b)r\nwith\nA1 (0, b) =\n\nL0\u03b4\u22121 \u03c4 (\u03b4)\n\nand\n\n1 \u2212 b\u22122\n2\u2212\u03b4\n\n(35)\n\n!\n\n(36)\n\nA2 (0, b) = L0\u03b4\u22121 \u03c4 (\u03b4)lnb ,\n\n(37)\n\nwhere\n\n\u03b4\n\u03c4 (\u03b4) = (1 \u2212 )2A(\u03b4)K4\u2212\u03b4 .\n(38)\n2\nFurther, we substitute the results (35) \u2013 (37) in the relations (32) \u2013 (34) and perform the\n \u0303 = L0\u03b4\u22121 \u03c4 (\u03b4)\u2206. In the new\nchange of the parameters u and \u2206 with \u01690 = L0\u03b4\u22121 \u03c4 (\u03b4)u0 and \u2206\nnotations, the Eqs. (32) \u2013 (34) take the form\n\u22122\n \u0303 1 \u2212 b \u2212 rlnb\nr = b {r + [4(n + 2)\u0169 \u2212 \u2206]\n2\u2212\u03b4\n\u2032\n\n!\n\n2\n\n13\n\n,\n\n(39)\n\n\f \u0303\n\u0169\u2032 = b4\u2212d\u2212\u03b4 {\u0169 \u2212 [4(n + 8)\u01692 \u2212 6\u0169\u2206]lnb}\n,\n\n \u0303 \u2032 = b4\u2212d\u2212\u03b4 {\u2206\n \u0303 \u2212 [8(n + 2)\u0169\u2206\n \u0303 \u2212 4\u2206\n \u0303 2 ]lnb} .\n\u2206\n\n(40)\n(41)\n\nThe relation (31) describes the trivial scale invariance of the thickness L0 . This triviality\nis a result of the equivalence of the short\u2013range random correlations along all D spatial\ndirections (isotropy of the disorder). As we shall see in Section 6, the extended impurities\nbreak this isotropy and the RG relation for L0 becomes nontrivial. The structure of\nEqs. (39) \u2013 (41) is the same as that of the known RG equations for infinite systems [13].\nThe difference is in the parameter \u03b4 6= 0. We shall see in the next Section that this simple\nstructure of the RG equations reflects the above mentioned isotropy in the distribution\nof the disorder. Note, that the factor 1/(2 \u2212 \u03b4) in Eq. (39) is relevant only for the precise\ndetermination of the FP value of the parameter r.The same iz valid for the \u03b4\u2013dependence\nof the integrals (35) \u2013 (37). In Section 4.3 we have already mentioned that the critical\nbehaviour represented by the critical exponents does not depend on the concrete values\n \u0303\nof the FP coordinates in the parameter space (r, u, \u2206) or, alternatively, in (r, \u0169, \u2206).\nThe (d, \u03b4)\u2013integration is a relatively clumsy variant of calculation and cannot be easily\napplied in RG calculations in higher loop approximations. But the same results are\nobtained by the (d + \u03b4)\u2013integration (15) which can be straightforwardly extended to\nconsiderations in higer orders of the loop expansion. Thus one can directly obtain the\ntwo\u2013loop results for the same problem. The structure of the RG equations is again the\nsame as that for the impurity problem in the corresponding infinite systems [13]. The\nsimple difference is that one should change d with (d + \u03b4), as it is for the Eqs. (39) \u2013 (41).\nThus we arrive at the main conclusion that irrespectively to the considered order of\nthe loop expansion, the results for the impure films are obtained from those for infinite\nsystems by the simple substitution of \u01eb = (4 \u2212 d) with \u01eb\u0303 = [4 \u2212 (d + \u03b4)] = (4 \u2212 Deff ).\nThe same is valid for the FP coordinates. Alternatively, by using the \u01eb\u0303\u2013expansion one\nobtains the results for both the D\u2013dimensional hyperslab (\u03b4 > 0) and the corresponding\ninfinite system (\u03b4 = 0). For the case of slabs we use the \u01eb\u0303 = (d + \u03b4)\u2013expansion as shown\nin Eqs. (39) \u2013 (41) and for the infinite system we take the limit \u03b4 \u2192 0, which means\nto perform an expansion in \u01eb\u0303 \u2261 \u01eb = (4 \u2212 d) = (5 \u2212 D). The reason for this (5 \u2212 D)\u2013\nexpansion for the infinite system is in the FSC (d \u2192 D) denoting the equivalence between\nthe critical behaviour in D\u2013impure films and that in d = (D \u2212 1)\u2013dimensional impure\ninfinite systems. Alternatively, in case of infinite systems, one may take the limit \u03b4 \u2192 1,\nDeff = (d + \u03b4) \u2192 D and, therefore, the expansion parameter is \u01eb = 4 \u2212 D.\nWithin the present RG analysis we have shown that the FSC can be described as a smooth\nchange of the behaviour of the system with the variation of \u03b4 from \u03b4 = 0 to \u03b4 \u2192 1. Bearing\nin mind our discussion in Section 4, the variations of \u03b4 between these limiting values mean\na corresponding variation of the ratio y = (L0 /\u03be) from y \u226a 1 to y \u226b 1. Although the\nsmooth variation of \u03b4 in the RG equations in the broad interval (0, 1), the FS crossover\nis expected to occur mainly in the interval |y \u2212 yc | \u223c yc , where the yc \u223c 1 is the critical\nratio.\n14\n\n\fIn general, the critical behaviour of the hyperslab will correspond to the MF description\nfor geometrical dimensionalities D > 5 \u2212 \u03b4. As our RG results are valid above the lower\neffective borderline dimensionality (d + \u03b4)L = 2, the nontrivial impure (for n < 4) or\npure (for n > 4) stable critical behaviour will occur for geometrical dimensionalities\n(3 \u2212 \u03b4) < D < (5 \u2212 \u03b4). We shall not derive and discuss the FPs and the related critical\nand stability exponents of the impure films because we have demonstrated that these\nquantities and, therefore, the critical behaviour of the film as a whole, are obtained by\nsetting \u01eb = (4 \u2212 d) \u2192 \u01eb\u0303 = (\u01eb \u2212 \u03b4) in the known results for the respective quantities of\nimpure infinite systems with the same type of disorder [13].\nFor real slabs (D = 3) we find that the nontrivial critical behaviour will appear for\n\u03b4 > 0. This implies L0 \u226b a (quasi\u20132D films) and, moreover, the real films should be\nthick enough to ensure a parameter \u03b4 > 0. In view of the discussion in Section 4, this\nprobably corresponds to the ratio (L0 /\u03be) of order of the unity. Denoting \u01eb\u0303 = (\u01eb\u2212\u03b4), where\n\u01eb = (4 \u2212 d), we see that the results initially obtained for \u01eb\u0303 \u226a 1 can be extrapolated to real\nfilms (d = 2) provided we extend the values of our small parameter to 1 < \u01eb\u0303 = (2 \u2212 \u03b4) < 2.\nThis is an advantage with respect to the simple extension of \u01eb = (4 \u2212 d) to \u01eb = 2 for 2D\u2013\nfilms. There are no problems for the extrapolations of the \u01eb\u0303\u2013results because the RG\nanalysis does not demonstrate any peculiarities of the RG analysis at these relatively low\ndimensionalities such as: the appearance of new FPs, any runway of the knoun (at \u01eb\u0303 \u226a 1)\nFPs, a qualitative change of the stability properties of the FPs or, a change of the location\nof the FPs in domains of the parameter space, where they could be unaccessible for the\nRG flows.\nFrom one side, we have shown, that the scope of the RG investigations with the help of\nfield theretical models does not include 2D\u2013dimensional films (mono\u2013layers) or extremely\nthin films consisting of several atomic layers (L0 \u223c a). From the other side, it has been\ncompletely clarified that the present approach can be undoubtedly applied to real films\n(D = 3).\n\n6\n6.1\n\nRG for extended impurities\nRG equations\n\nThe RG equations for the case the extended impurities and inhomogeneities described by\nthe Eqs. (5)\u2013(7) are derived in the way outlined in the preceding Section. In order to\nsimplify the notations we introduce the new variables v = L0\u03b4\u22121 \u03c4 (\u03b4)u and \u03bc = K4\u2212\u03b4 \u2206.\nThen, the RG relations can be written in the form\nk0\u2032\n\n= bk0\n\n(\n\nb\u03b4 \u2212 1\n1+\u03bc\n2\u03b4\n\n15\n\n)\n\n,\n\n(42)\n\n\fr\n\n1 \u2212 b\u22122\n\u2212 r ln b\n= b r + 4(n + 2)v\n2\u2212\u03b4\n\"\n!#)\n1 \u2212 b\u22122+\u03b4\nb\u03b4 \u2212 1\n\u2212 \u03bc\n,\n\u2212r\n2\u2212\u03b4\n\u03b4\n2\n\n\u2032\n\nL\u20320\nL0\n\n4\u2212d\n\n\u2032\n\nv =b\n\n4\u2212d\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03bc =b\n\n(\n\n!\u03b4 (\n\n(\n\n#\n\n\"\n\n(43)\n\nb\u03b4 \u2212 1\nv \u2212 4(n + 8)v ln b + 6v\u03bc\n\u03b4\n2\n\n\u03bc \u2212 8(n + 2)v\u03bc ln b + 4\u03bc\n\n2\n\nb\u03b4 \u2212 1\n\u03b4\n\n!)\n\n!)\n\n,\n\n.\n\n(44)\n(45)\n\nThese RG relations have been obtained by the \u01eb = (4 \u2212 Deff )\u2013expansion around the upper\n(U )\nborderline dimensionality Deff = 4 (see Section 6). In contrast to the case in Section 6\nthe scaling invariant solutions of these RG relations cannot be found for any \u03b4 \u2208 [0, 1].\nIn order to obtain such solutions we must consider \u03b4 \u226a 1 and to substitute the factor\n(b\u03b4 \u2212 1)/\u03b4 with lnb. As our expansion parameter is \u01eb\u0303 = [4 \u2212 (d + \u03b4)] \u226a 1, this means\nthat we must investigate the case when \u03b4 \u226a and \u01eb = (4 \u2212 d) \u226a 1. Thus we have a single\n\u01eb\u0303\u2013expansion with two small parameters: \u01eb = (4 \u2212 d) and \u03b4. This variant of the theory is\noften reffered to as a \"double (\u03b4, \u01eb)\u2013expansion\" [10, 14]. The anisotropy of the random\ncorrelations \"breaks\" the single \u01eb\u0303\u2013expansion to a double one.\nThe \u03bc\u2013contribution in the RG relation (30) for k0 comes from a perturbation term shown\ndiagrammatically in Fig. 2. In contast to the usual one\u2013loop results, this self\u2013energy\ncontribution depends on the wave number k0 . The reason is that the broken line of the\ndiagram in Fig. 3 does not carry external wave numbers k0 . This is a direct consequence\nof the fact that the random function \u03c6(~k) does not depend on k0 , i. e. of the infinite\nranged correlations along the small site L0 . The \u03bc\u2013dependence in the RG equation for k0\nleads to a nontrivial scaling relation for the thickness L0 , namely,\nL0 = L\u20320 b1+\u03bc/2 ,\n\n(46)\n\nwhich is quite similar to the scaling relations for the temperature T known from studies\nof quantum critical phenomena [17]. The scaling law (34) has the critical exponent\nzd = 1 +\n\n\u03bc\u2217\n,\n2\n\n(47)\n\nwhere the asterisk (\u2217) denotes any FP value of \u03bc. This exponent is analogous to the\ndynamical critical exponent in the theory of dynamical critical phenomena in classical\nmodels with quenched disorder [15] and quantum systems [16, 17].\nUsing the relation (46) and \u03b4 \u226a 1, the Eqs. (43)\u2013(45) can be written in the form\n\u2032\n\n2\n\nr =b\n\n(\n\n1 \u2212 b\u22122\nr + [4(n + 2)v \u2212 \u03bc]\n\u2212 r ln b\n2\n\"\n\n#)\n\n,\n\n(48)\n\nv \u2032 = b4\u2212d\u2212\u03b4(1+\u03bc/2) v0 \u2212 [4(n + 8)v 2 \u2212 6v\u03bc] ln b ,\n\n(49)\n\nn\n\no\n\n16\n\n\fn\n\no\n\n\u03bc\u2032 = b4\u2212d \u03bc \u2212 [8(n + 2)v\u03bc \u2212 4\u03bc2 ] ln b .\n\n(50)\n\nThe extra\u2013factor b\u2212\u03b4\u03bc/2 in Eq. (49) is not essential for the RG analysis to this (\u01eb\u03031 \u2013) order\nof the theory because \u03bc\u03b4 \u223c \u01eb\u03b4 \u223c \u01eb2 .\nThe RG relations (48)\u2013(50) yield new \u03b4\u2013corrections to the relevant physical quantities.\nThey present the difference between the critical properties of the impure film and the\ncorresponding infinite impure system.\n\n6.2\n\nFPs and critical exponents\n\nThe RG relations (48) \u2013 (50) have four FPs: the Gaussian FP (hereafter referred to as\nGFP) with coordinates (uG = \u03bcG = 0), the so\u2013called \"unphysical\" FP (UFP), vU = 0,\n\u03bcU = \u2212\u01eb/4, the Heisenberg FP (HFP),\nvH =\n\n\u01eb\u2212\u03b4\n,\n4(n + 8)\n\n\u03bcH = 0 ,\n\n(51)\n\nand the random FP (RFP),\nvR =\n\n\u01eb + 2\u03b4\n,\n16(n \u2212 1)\n\n\u03bcR =\n\n(4 \u2212 n)\u01eb + 2(n + 2)\u03b4\n.\n8(n \u2212 1)\n\n(52)\n\nAll these FPs are known by the work of T. C. Lubensky [13]. Here the FPs require a\nfurther investigation because of the FS effect (\u03b4 > 0).\nAs usual, the GFP always exists and is stable for d > 4. The UFP has no physical\nmeaning for \u01eb > 0, namely, for d < 4, because the parameter \u03bc must always be nonnegative\n(\u03bc \u223c \u2206). For d > 4, the UFP is physical (\u03bcU > 0) but unstable. For 4 < d < (4 + 2\u03b4),\nthe UFP has an instability towards \u03bc, whereas the same FP has a double instability\n(towards both v and \u03bc) for d > (4 + 2\u03b4). Further, we shall concentrate our attention on\nthe GFP, HFP and RFP. In order to analyze their properties we must obtain the critical\nand stability exponents.\nThe stability exponents of the GFP are \u03bb(G)\n= \u01eb \u2212 \u03b4 and \u03bb(G)\n= \u01eb. These values show\nv\n\u03bc\nthat the GFP is stable only for d > 4, where it describes an usual (free of disorder and\nfluctuation interactions) Gaussian behaviour.

The requirement of stability \u03bb(H)\n< 0 leads\n\u03bc\nto the following inequality\n4(4 \u2212 d + \u03b4) < (4 \u2212 d \u2212 2\u03b4)n .\n\n(60)\n\nWhen we solve this inequality with respect to n we should have in mind that the quantities\n(4 \u2212 d) = \u01eb \u223c \u03b4 are small and that is why it is not convenient to divide the ineq. (60) by\nthe small factor (4 \u2212 d \u2212 2\u03b4). For this reason, let us consider first the case \u03b4 = 0, where\nthe inequality (60) is valid for n > 4, provided d < 4. Further, we consider n = 4 and\nfor this value we easily find that the inequality (60) cannot be satisfied for any \u03b4 \u2265 0.\nTherefore, for n = 4, the HFP is unstable towards the parameter \u03bc, i. e. towards the\ndisorder effects. For infinite systems (\u03b4 = 0) with n = 4, the HFP has a marginal stability\n(\u03bb\u03bc(H) = 0). The problem of whether the HFP is stable for n = 4 and \u03b4 = 0 has been\nwidely discussed in preceding studies [13] in high orders in \u01eb. In particular, this topic has\nbeen extensively investigated by I. D. Lawrie et al (see Ref.[12]) for the case of impure\nsystems with a cubic anisotropy. It has been shown that the higher orders in the loop\nexpansion do not give the initially expected reliability in the treatment of the stability\nproperties of the HFP near and at the value n = 4 of the symmetry index n. The reason\nis not in the specific features of the model but is a general disadvantage of the RG studies\nof systems with competing effects. Therefore, the same problem cannot be reliably solved\nin the present case, too.\n18\n\n\fThe inequality (60) is used together with \u03bb(H)\n< 0 and d > (2\u2212\u03b4) in order to demonstrate\nv\nthat the HFP is unstable for all n < 4. For n > 4, the stability requirements \u03bb(H)\n< 0,\nv\n(H)\n\u03bb\u03bc < 0 and d > (2 \u2212 \u03b4) yield the domain of stability\n2 \u2212 \u03b4 < d < dH ,\nwhere\ndH = 4 \u2212\n\n(61)\n\n2(n + 2)\n\u03b4.\n(n \u2212 4)\n\n(62)\n\nIn fact, the conditions (61) are satisfied for all \u03b4 \u2208 [0, 1] provided n > 16, and for\n0 \u2264 \u03b4 < \u03b40 with \u03b40 = 2(n \u2212 4)/(n + 8) provided 4 < n < 16. Increasing the value of \u03b4, the\ninterval of variations of d decreases and for \u03b4 = max(\u03b4H , 1) the width of the d\u2013domain of\nstability becomes zero.\nThe stability properties of the RFP can be investigated only for n 6= 1, because of the\ndegeneration [13] of the RG equations at n = 1. This degeneration leads to a special\ncritical behaviour described by complex stability exponents [13] and, hance, by oscillatory\ncorrections to the main scaling laws [13]. The investigation of the \"oscillatory\" critical\nbehaviour is made in higher orders of \u01eb and \u03b4. The values 0 < n < 1 are of an academic\ninterest only. We shall consider the case n > 1.\nUsing the physical requirement \u03bcR > 0, one obtains an inequality inverse to (60). Further,\nwe must distinguish between two cases of stability of the RFP: (R) real negative exponents\n(R)\n(R)\n\u03bb1,2 < 0, and (C) complex exponets \u03bb1,2 with negative real parts. For the case (R), using\n(R)\nEqs. (55)-(56), the requirement \u03bb1,2 < 0, d > (2 \u2212 \u03b4) and the inequality inverse to (60),\nwe determine the following domain RR of stability in the (d, n, \u03b4) space:\n2 \u2212 \u03b4 < d < (4 + 2\u03b4) ,\n\n(63)\n\n(4 \u2212 n)(4 \u2212 d) + 2(n + 2)\u03b4 > 0 ,\n\n(64)\n\n3n(4 \u2212 d) + 2(4 \u2212 n)\u03b4 > 0 ,\n\n(65)\n(R)\n\nand \u0398 \u2265 0. For the case (ii) of complex stability exponents \u03bb1,2 , the domain of stability\nRC is defined by the inequalities (64), (65), \u0398 < 0, and d > (2 \u2212 \u03b4).\nThe criteria of stability can be investigated numerically for all allowed values of d, \u03b4 and\nn 6= 1. Here we shall restrict the analysis to those values of n which might be of importance\nfor real systems or for the explanation of the properties of the model. The most important\ntheoretical problem is the comparison of the domains of stabilities of the G, H and R FPS\nfor values of n = 2, 3, 4, ...\n(R)\n\nFor n = 4, one easily obtains the picture in Fig. 3. The RFP with real exponents \u03bb1,2\nis stable in the domain RR defined by 0 < \u03b4 < \u03b44 and (2 \u2212 d) < d < dR (4), where\n19\n\n\f\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03b44 = 2/(1 + 2 3) and dR (4) = 4 \u2212 2(1 + 3). In Fig. 3, the point a has coordinates\n(\u03b4a \u2261 \u03b44 \u2248 0.45, da = 1.55), the point b has coordinates (1, 1), and the point c is given\nby (1, 4). The domain RC in Fig. 3 denotes the stability region of the random critical\nbehaviour with complex stability exponents. This domain is given by the inequalities\ndR (4) < d < 4 provided \u03b4 < \u03b44 , and by (2 \u2212 \u03b4) < d < 4 for \u03b44 < \u03b4 \u2264 1.\nFor 1 < n < 4 the stability criteria for R in the case of real stability exponents are \u0398 \u2265 0\nand\n2 \u2212 \u03b4 < d < dR ,\n(66)\nwhere\n\n2(4 \u2212 n)\u03b4\n.\n(67)\n3n\nThe domain RC of complex stability exponents is given by the inequalities \u0398 < 0 and (66).\ndR = 4 +\n\nThe domains of stability RR and RC for 1 < n < 4 are quite similar to those in the case\nn = 4 depicted in Fig. 3, but the coordinates of the points a and c in the (\u03b4, d) plane vary\nwith n. The coordinates (\u03b4a , da ) and (dc , \u03b4c = 1) of the points a and c are given in Table\n1 for several values of n. The value \u03b4a decreases from 0.45 to zero with the decrease of n\nfrom n \u223c 4 to n \u223c 8/5. For n < 8/5, \u03b4a increases with the decrease of n.\nTABLE 1.\nn 7/5\n\u03b4a 1.06\nda 1.94\ndc 5.24\n\nValues of \u03b4a , da , and dc\n8/5 9/5 2\n3\n0.02 0.05 0.26\n1.98 1.95 1.74\n5\n4.81 4.67 4.22\n\n4\n0.45\n1.55\n4\n\nThe value n = 8/5 is quite special because for this value the function \u0398(n, \u01eb, \u03b4) given\nby Eq. (56) depends linearly on \u01eb. Within our one\u2013loop approximation, the domain RR\nat n = 8/5 does not exist at all and the domain RC is expanded up to 0 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 1 and\n2 \u2212 \u03b4 \u2264 d \u2264 4 + \u03b4. In our case, the effective values of \u03b4a (8/5) and da (8/5) are 0 and 2,\nrespectively. It has been shown by I. D. Lawrie et al [13] that the same value n = 8/5\nis the reason for the peculiar critical behaviour of infinite impure systems (\u03b4 = 0) with\na cubic anisotropy. So, one may expect that in our case a similar peculiar behaviour at\nn = 8/5 with singularities of the \u01eb\u2013expansion and complex exponents will occur.\nIt is seen from Table 1 that the coordinate dc (n) in Fig. 3 is larger than dc (4) = 4 for all\n0 < n < 4. This means that for all 1 < n < 4, there is a triangle domain for certain values\nd > 4, where both the RFP and the GFP are stable. In this region there is a competition\nbetween the pure Gaussian behaviour represented by the GFP and the impure behaviour\nrepresented by RFP. The outcome of this competition should depend on the strength of\nthe disorder effect.\nFor n > 4, both the RFP and the HFP are stable for certain values of d and \u03b4. The\nstability domains RR and RC can be determined with the help of the inequalities (63)\u2013\n20\n\n\f(65). For \u03b4 < \u03b40 , the domain RR is confined by the inequalities \u0398 \u2265 0, and\ndH < d < dR\n\n(68)\n\nwhereas for \u03b4 > \u03b40 , the same domain is described by the inequalities \u0398 \u2265 0 and\n2 \u2212 \u03b4 < d < dR\n\n(69)\n\nThe domain RC is defined by the same inequalities (68) and (69) but for \u0398 < 0.\nA typical picture of the stability domains in this case is given in Fig. 4 for n = 6,\nwhere the points h and a have coordinates: \u03b4h \u2261 \u03b40 (6) = 0.29, dh = 1.61, \u03b4a = 0.74\nand da = 1.26. The HFP is stable for relatively small values of \u03b4, whereas the stability\nof the RFP dominates for large values of \u03b4. There is a domain (4 \u2212 0.22\u03b4) < d < 4 of\ndimensionalities d \u223c 4 for which both the RFP and the HFP are unstable. This domain is\ndefined by the location of the point c with coordinates \u03b4c = 1, dc(6) = 3.78; see the shaded\nregion in Fig. 4. Such domains of instability exist for all symmetry indices n > 4 and\n\u03b4 > 0. They can be described by the inequality d\u2032 (n, \u03b4) < d < 4 which can be obtained\nby the RG analysis. For n = 6 and \u03b4 = 1, d\u2032 (n, \u03b4) = dc (6) as shown in Fig. 4. For \u03b4 \u2192 0,\nd\u2032 (n, \u03b4) \u2192 4 and for \u03b4 \u2192 1, d\u2032 (n, \u03b4) is lowered up to a minimal value d\u2032 (\u221e, 1) = 3.33 (See\nalso Fig. 5).\nAs the GFP is stable only for d > 4, the shaded domain in Fig. 5 remains the region of\na total instability of the system. This total lack of stable FPs for all n > 4, \u03b4 > 0 and\ncertain d \u223c 4 can be interpreted as an indication for a fluctuation\u2013driven impure tricritical\nphenomenon followed by a first\u2013order phase transition. The FS system (\u03b4 > 0) is unstable\ntowards the disorder (the parameter \u03bc) and, hence, the reason for the appearance of a\nfluctuation-driven phase transition of first\u2013order is in the simultaneous effect of the FS\nand the extended impurities.\nIn order to justify the prediction for the existence of a tricritical point and a fluctuation (or\ndisorder)\u2013driven phase transition of first order, we remind that the fluctuation interactions\nrepresented by the parameter u are relatively small near four dimensionalities (d \u223c 4).\nUnder such circumstances, the disorder effects may alter the sign of the effectivelly small\nparameter u from u > 0 (a second\u2013order transition) to u < 0 (a first\u2013order transition).\nAt u = 0, a tricritical point should appear. Note, that these effects are impossible for\ninfinite impure systems and in pure FS systems. The change of the order of the phase\ntransition in the present case is a result of the competition between fluctuation, disorder\nand FS effects. The effective fluctuation model for the description of this change of the\norder of the phase transition can be constructed by adding an additional u6 \u03c66 term to\nthe Hamiltonian (1).\nThe stability domain of the HFP vanishes when the symmetry index n decreases from 6\nto 4. Increasing the number n to n = 16, the stability region of the HFP expands up to\nthe triangle 2b4 (see the dotted line 4b in Fig. 4). The further increase of the values of n\nabove n = 16 leads to an enlargement of the stability region of the HFP so that the points\n21\n\n\fh and a already lay on the vertical line \u03b4 = 1. For n \u2192 \u221e (the limit of the spherical\nmodel [9]) the point h has coordinates (1, 2) on the vertical line \u03b4 = 1, as shown in Fig.\n5. The RR is extremely small but persists (see the narrow wing h4a with da = 2.19). The\ndomain RC is shown in Fig. 5 by the triangle a4c, where dc = 3.33. In Figs. 4\u20136, the\npoint b has the same coordinates (1, 1).\n\n7\n\nSummary and validity of the results\n\nWe have obtained and analyzed in details the RG recursion relations for FS systems of\nslab geometry described by the n\u2013component LG model containing quenched impurities.\nTwo models of quenched impurities have been considered. The results demonstrate the\noutcome of the competition between the effects of fluctuation interactions, the finite size,\nand the disorder.\nWe have used an \u01eb\u0303 = (4 \u2212 Deff )\u2013expansion defined by the effective spatial dimensionality\n\u03b4 = (Deff \u2212 d) of the fluctuation modes of the order parameter. Our approach is based\non an approximate substitution of the lattice summation with an integration in dimensionalities less than unity. The limitations of this approach have been considered. The\napproach is more general that the familiar RG considerations based on the \u01eb = (4 \u2212 d)\u2013\nexpansion. The fundamental relationship between the effective dimensionality Deff and\nthe ratio y = (L0 /\u03be) of the characteristic lengths of the film has been introduced and\ndiscussed.\nThe most interesting cases of critical phenomena are those for \u03b4 \u226a 1 (thin films) and\n\u03b4 \u226b 1 (thick films, when the film behaves as an almost\u2013infinite system). It has been\ndemonstrated that our approach based on an integration in dimensionalities less than\nunity is reliable for the description of these cases, in particular, for real films (D = 3).\nThe method introduced in this paper has been used to demostrate the validity of the FSC\nin films with homogeneously distributed quenched impurities with short\u2013range random\ncorrelations. It has been shown that the proof of the FSC in these systems can be easily\nproven and straightforwardly expanded to any order in the loop expansion. The reason\nis that the impurity correlations are spatially isotropic and the sum (\u01eb + \u03b4) can be taken\nas the single expansion parameter \u01eb\u0303.\nThe extended impurities break the spatial isotropy of the disordered system, and the\nRG investigation yields a dependence of the critical exponents on two small parameters:\n\u01eb = (4 \u2212 d) = (5 \u2212 D) and \u03b4. This leads to another picture of the critical behaviour which\nwill be summarized in the remainder of this Section.\nThe dependence of the FP coordinates and the critical exponents on the small parameters\n(\u01eb, \u03b4) and the symmetry index n has been calculated and analyzed with respect to the\nstability properties of the FPs. In this way we have established the possible types of critical\nbehaviour for different values of \u03b4, the geometric dimensionality D of the hyperslab, and\n22\n\n\fn. In order to describe the random critical behaviour in films with extended impuirities\nwe have introduce and calculated a new critical exponent zd . The analogy between this\nexponent and the dynamical exponent in quantum systems has been emphasized. The\n(L)\nresults are valid for effective dimensionalities Deff > Deff = 2 \u2013 the lower borderline\ndimensionality.\nFor real films (D = 3) with extended impurities our analysis is valid for the so\u2013called\nquasi\u20132D (thin films), where \u03b4 > 0. So, the results from our RG analysis performed for\nsmall values of \u01eb and \u03b4 can be exptrapolated for predictions of the critical behaviour of\nreal impure films (D = 3, d = 2) with a finine thickness L0 \u226b a, where the \u03b4(y) > 0.\nWe have shown that, in the strict mathematical sense, the latter condition is always valid\nfor y > 0, i. e. when the system is outside the critical point. But in real expriments\nthe conditions for the validity of our consideration are somewhat different. The function\n\u03b4(y) \u223c 0 up to values of y \u223c 1 and, therefore, in experimental conditions (\u03be \u226b a) the\nthickness L0 \u223c \u03be should be much larger than the interparticle distance a. As far as\nthe behaviour in the critical region (\u03be \u226b a) is concerned the condition y > 0 will be\neasily satisfied for films with L0 \u226b a. This is the case of interest for experiments. The\ncase of exactly 2D films (L0 = a) corresponds to the lower borderline dimensionality\nand, therefore, is beyond the scope of our investigation. The invalidity of the results at\nthe lower borderline dimensionality is a generic disadvantage of the field\u2013theoretical RG\nmethods rather than a result of our particular approach to the problem. The 2D case can\nbe effectively achieved for any film in the asymptotic vicinity of the critical point, where\n\u03be \u2192 \u221e and, hence, the ratio y \u2192 0 for any finite thickness L0 . However, this situation is\nnot of interest for the most part of real experiments.\n(L)\n\nWhile the condition Deff > Deff = 2 guarantees the reliability of the qualitative predictions of our RG analysis, the extrapolation of the results obtained near the upper\n(U )\nborderline dimensionality Deff = (4 \u2212 d \u2212 \u03b4) to the real dimensionality (d = 2) requires\nan extension of the values of the small parameter \u01eb\u0303 to values \u01eb\u0303 \u223c (2 \u2212 \u03b4) < 2. This is\nthe usual way of extrapolation of the RG results to real systems. It is believed the small\nparameter \u01eb\u0303 should be set equal to (2 \u2212 \u03b4) in order to predict the values of the critical\nexponents for the real case (\u03b4 \u226a 1) and that in this case, the one\u2013loop results do not\ngive quantitatively correct predictions. Although this is generally true, the qualitative\npredictions from the one\u2013loop results are reliable, in particular, for the solution of important problems like the possible types of critical behaviour and the conditions under\nwhich a critical behaviour can occur. In this article we have been mainly involved in these\ntype of problems and the results are well grounded within the one\u2013loop approximation.\nThe practice of the numerous applications of the RG to complex systems shows that the\none\u2013loop results about the general picture of the critical phenomena remain valid within\nthe framework of consideration by higher loop approximations. For real films \u01eb\u0303 = (2 \u2212 \u03b4)\nshould take values \u01eb\u0303 \u223c 2 for \u03b4 \u226a 1 and \u01eb\u0303 \u223c 1 for \u03b4 \u223c 1 (thick films). Therefore, the analysis carried out in Section 6 is reliable for the case of real films and their critical behaviour\nis given by Figs. 3 \u2013 5 on the line d = 2. In addition to this conventional point of view\n23\n\n\fwe shall stress that the results for small values of \u01eb = (4 \u2212 d) can also be extrapolated to\nreal films but for those parts of the critical region which are not asymptotically close to\nthe critical point. Thus the fluctuation\u2013driven change of the order of the phase transition\nnear the upper borderline dimensionality (4 + \u03b4) can be extrapolated to real effective\ndimensionality (d + \u03b4), provided one is interested in fluctuation phenomena which occur\noutside the asymptotic vicinity of the critical point.\nA brief summary of other results for the critical behaviour in real dimensionalities (d =\n2, 0 < \u03b4 < 1) can be outlined with the help of Figs. 3 \u2013 5. This critical behaviour is\ndescribed by the HFP and the RFP. For 1 < n \u2264 4, only the random critical behaviour is\npresent. For relatively thick films this critical behaviour will exhibit oscilatory corrections\nto the scaling laws described by complex stability exponents, whereas the ramiliar random\ncritical behaviour will occur in relatively thin films. For n > 4, the pure critical behaviour\nrepresented by the properties of the HFP will occur for relativelu thin films whereas the\nrandom critical behaviour in its two variants of real and complex stability exponents will\noccur in thick films. In the spherical limit (n = \u221e) the pure critical behaviour is stable\nfor all real films and the disorder effects are irrelevant for the critical properties. The\nsingular behaviour of the films for the symmetry indices n = 1 and n = 8/5 has been\nexplained in Section 6.\nFinally, we note, that the present investigation reveals essential differences in the critical\nbehaviour of infinite and FS systems with extended impurities. The finite thickness L0\nof the film leads to: an essential dependence of the critical exponents on the noninteger\ndimensional portion \u03b4, a fluctuation\u2013driven change of the order of the phase transition for\nall n > 4 and d \u223c 4 (the almost\u2013MF region), the competition between the pure (Gaussian)\nand impure critical regimes for all 1 < n < 4 and 2 \u2264 d < 4, and the dominating role\nof the impure (random) critical behaviour with oscillatory corrections to the scaling laws\nfor all relatively thick films.\nAcknowledgments:\nL.

The discontinuous line reprsents the disorder average\n[|\u03c6(~k)|2 ]R = \u2206 and the continuous line represents the bare correlation function\nG0 (k0 , ~k + ~k1 ).\nFig.2. Stability domains of R for n = 4: RR (triangle 2a4) and RC (4abc).\nFig. 3. Stability domains of H (triangle 2h4) and R for n > 4. RR is given by the triangle\nh4a and RC is the rectangle a4cb. The dotted line b4 marks the extension of the stability\ndomain of H for n = 16. The shaded region is explained in the text.\nFig. 4. Stability domains of H and R for n = \u221e (Hartree limit [10]). RR and RC are\ngiven by the triangles h4a and a4c, respectively.\n\n27\n\n\f"}
