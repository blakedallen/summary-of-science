INTRODUCTION\n\nA reconstruction of states of quantum systems from experimental data represents an important tool for a verification\nof predictions of quantum theory. It also allows us to check the fidelity of quantum state preparation as well to study\nthe fidelity of processing of information encoded in states of quantum systems. Complementary, discrepancies between\nestimated (reconstructed) states based on the measured data and theoretical predictions can serve as an indicator of\nvarious noise sources which occur during the quantum information processing or in the measurement of quantum states.\nWithout a priori assumptions about the character of physical processes and properties of reconstruction schemes the\nreconstruction cannot distinguish between imperfections related to an incoherent quantum state processing and nonideal measurements [1]. Determination of limits for coherent control of quantum degrees of freedom or identification\nof sources of decoherence are essential for systems which are considered for quantum computing and information\nprocessing [2].\nIn atomic optics a highly coherent control of motional degrees of freedom has been achieved for trapped ions [3]\nand recently also for neutral atoms [4,5]. Cold atoms can be cooled into specific quantum states within micro-wells\nof an optical lattice which is induced by laser beams. Cold neutral atoms in optical lattices represent a promising\nsystem for quantum information processing. To verify a degree (fidelity) of coherent control over motional degrees of\nfreedom of neutral atoms a reconstruction of their motional quantum states from measured data has to be considered.\nWe develop a reconstruction procedure based on the Jaynes principle of Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) [6\u20138] to achieve\nthis goal. This scheme allows us to perform a state reconstruction from the experimental data obtained at the ENS\nin Paris.\nIn Section II we present a brief description of the reconstruction procedure of a density operator of a quantum system\nbased on the Jaynes principle of Maximum Entropy. In Section III we utilize the MaxEnt principle for development\nof the reconstruction scheme of motional states of atoms and we perform numerical tests of our approach in Section\nIII. Our reconstruction scheme is applied to the experimental data in Section IV.\n\nII. MAXENT PRINCIPLE AND RECONSTRUCTION OF DENSITY OPERATORS\n\nLet us assume a set of observables \u011c\u03bd (\u03bd = 1, . . . , n) associated with the quantum system under consideration.\nThis system is prepared in an unknown state \u03c1\u0302. Let us assume that from a measurement performed over the system\nmeanvalues G\u03bd of the observables \u011c\u03bd are found. The task is to determine (estimate) the unknown state of the quantum\nsystem based on the results of the measurement. Providing the set of the observables \u011c\u03bd is not equal to the quorum\n(i.e., the complete set of system observables [9]), then the measured meanvalues do not determine the state uniquely.\nSpecifically, there is a large number of density operators which fulfill the conditions\nTr \u03c1\u0302{\u011c} = 1,\nTr (\u03c1\u0302{\u011c} \u011c\u03bd ) = G\u03bd , \u03bd = 1, 2, ..., n ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nthat is, the the normalization condition and the constraints imposed by the results of the measurement. To estimate\nthe unknown density operator in the most reliable way we utilize the Jaynes principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt\n1\n\n\fprinciple) [6\u20138,10] according to which among those operators which fulfill the constraints (2.1) the most reliable\nreconstruction (estimation) \u03c1\u0302r is the one with the maximal value of the von Neumann entropy S(\u03c1\u0302) = \u2212Tr(\u03c1\u0302 ln \u03c1\u0302):\ni\nh\n(2.2)\nS(\u03c1\u0302r ) = max S(\u03c1\u0302{\u011c} ); \u2200\u03c1\u0302{\u011c} .\nAs shown by E.Jaynes [6] The operator which fulfills the constraints (2.1) and simultaneously maximizes the von\nNeumann entropy can be expressed in the generalized canonical form\nX\n1\nexp (\u2212\n(2.3)\n\u03c1\u0302r =\n\u03bb\u03bd \u011c\u03bd );\nZ{\u011c}\n\u03bd\nwhere\nZ{\u011c} (\u03bb1 , ..., \u03bbn ) = Tr[exp(\u2212\n\nX\n\n\u03bb\u03bd \u011c\u03bd )],\n\n(2.4)\n\n\u03bd\n\nis the generalized partition function and \u03bb\u03bd are the Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrange multipliers \u03bb\u03bd are chosen\nso that the density operator (2.3) fulfills the constraints (2.1) imposed by the results of the measurement. It is then\nobvious that the meanvalues G\u03bd which determine the density operator are related to the Lagrange multipliers via the\nderivatives of the partition function\nG\u03bd = Tr(\u03c1\u0302r \u011c\u03bd ) = \u2212\n\n\u2202\nln Z{\u011c} (\u03bb1 , ..., \u03bbn ).\n\u2202\u03bb\u03bd\n\n(2.5)\n\nIf we solve the last equation with respect to the Lagrange multipliers we can express them in terms of the measured\nmeanvalues\n\u03bb\u03bd = \u03bb\u03bd (G1 , ..., Gn ).\n\n(2.6)\n\nWhen we substitute the Lagrange multipliers (2.6) into the expression for the generalized canonical density operator\n(2.3) we obtain the explicit expression for the reconstructed (estimated) density operator.\nAs a typical example of the application of the MaxEnt principle we can consider a measurement of a single-mode\nelectromagnetic field, modeled as a harmonic oscillator. Imagine, that as a result of the measurement we know the\nmean photon number n\u0304 in the given field mode. Certainly, there are (infinitely) many quantum states of a single-mode\nelectromagnetic field (e.g., a Fock state, a coherent state, a squeezed state, etc.) with the given mean photon number.\nSo the question is: Which is the best (most reliable) estimation of the measured state given the mean photon number\nis known? The mean photon number is in some sense the least available information about the measured state.\nConsequently, the state is least determined. On the other, pure states are completely determined which is reflected\nby the fact that they have a zero von Neumann entropy. Therefore we expect that the most reliable reconstruction\nin the given case is a statistical mixture which is determined just by a single parameter - the mean photon number.\nIt is well known that a statistical mixture which is parametrized just by a single parameter is a thermal state. This\nstatistical mixture of Fock states is characterized by a temperature, or the corresponding mean photon number. In\naddition, for a given temperature (mean photon number) the thermal state exhibits the largest von Neumann entropy.\nConsequently, from the Jaynes principle of the maximum entropy it follows that if from a measurement only a mean\nphoton number is known that the most reliable estimation of the measured state is the thermal state.\nThe MaxEnt principle is not the only criterion how to choose an appropriate density operator among those \u03c1\u0302{\u011c}\nwhich fulfill the constraints (2.1). Based on an intuition or some addition a priori knowledge one can apply other\ncriteria. For example, the maximum likelihood principle has been adopted successfully for estimation of quantum\nstates [12]. Although this reconstruction scheme can result in nonphysical estimations (e.g., density operators which\nare not properly normalized, etc). In general, a consistent reconstruction scheme has to avoid nonphysical results\n(e.g. occurrence of negative probabilities). In the MaxEnt reconstruction a physical estimate is guaranteed by the\ncanonical form of the density operator (2.3). The MaxEnt principle is the most conservative assignment in the sense\nthat it does not permit one to draw any conclusions not warranted by the data. From this point of view the MaxEnt\nprinciple has a very close relation (or can be understood as the generalization) of the Laplace's principle of indifference\nwhich states that where nothing is known one should choose a constant valued function to reflect this ignorance. Then\nit is just a question how to quantify a degree of this ignorance. If we choose an entropy to quantify the ignorance,\nthen the relation between the Laplace's indifference principle and the Jaynes principle of the Maximum Entropy is\ntransparent, i.e. for a constant-valued probability distribution the entropy takes its maximum value.\nThe MaxEnt reconstruction has been applied for various quantum systems, such as light field mode, spin systems\n[11]. In what follows we adopt it for the reconstruction of vibrational states of neutral atoms. We assume the\nexperimental setup realized by the group of C. Salomon at the ENS in Paris [4,5].\n2\n\n\fIII. RECONSTRUCTION OF MOTIONAL STATES OF NEUTRAL ATOMS\n\nRecently, experimental manipulations of motional quantum states of neutral atoms have been reported by the group\nof C. Salomon in Paris [4,5]. Cold Cs atoms can be cooled into specific quantum states of a far detuned 1D optical\nlattice. The optical lattice is induced by the interference of two laser beams. Along the vertical z axis a periodic\npotential of \"harmonic\" micro-wells is produced with a period of 665 nm and with an amplitude of about 0.2 \u03bcK [5].\nThe vertical oscillation frequency in ap\nmicro-well at the center of the trappis \u03c9z /2\u03c0 = 85 kHz. The corresponding\nground state has the rms size \u2206z0 = h\u0304/2m\u03c9z \u2248 21 nm and \u2206p0 /m = h\u0304\u03c9z /2m \u2248 11 mm/s is its rms velocity\nwidth. The trapped cloud of neutral Cs atoms has a nearly Gaussian shape with a vertical rms size \u2206\u03be0 = 53 \u03bcm.\nWith the help of deterministic manipulations the neutral atoms can be prepared in non-classical 1D motional states\nalong the vertical axis such as squeezed states, number states, or specific superpositions of number states [5]. The\nmeasurement of the prepared quantum state \u03c1\u0302 is performed as follows: The system is evolved within the harmonic\npotential during the time \u03c4 . Then the lasers are turned off and the system undergoes the ballistic expansion (BE).\nAfter the time of flight T = 8.7 ms a 2D absorption image of the cloud is taken in 50 \u03bcs with a horizontal beam [5].\nIntegration of 2D absorption images in the horizontal direction gives us the spatial distribution along the vertical z\naxis. Therefore we will consider only 1D quantum-mechanical system along the vertical axis.\nTo confirm that a desired quantum state has been obtained (engineered) one can compare the spatial distributions\nalong the vertical axis with the predicted ones. The coincidence of these spatial distributions is a necessary but not\nthe sufficient requirement. A complete verification of the fidelity of the preparation of desired quantum states requires\na quantum state reconstruction procedure. In order to perform this task we adopt the MaxEnt principle [11]. To do\nso we utilize a close analogy between quantum homodyne tomography [14] and the BE absorption imaging for the\ncase of the point-like cloud (with the rms size equal to zero).\nA. Quantum tomography via MaxEnt principle\n\nQuantum tomography is based on the inverse Radon transformation\nof the the measured probability density distri\u0001\nbutions w\u03c1\u0302 (x\u03b8 ) for rotated quadratures x\u0302\u03b8 = \u221a12 \u00e2e\u2212i\u03b8 + \u00e2\u2020 ei\u03b8 [13,14]. These distributions can be represented as a\nresult of the measurement of the continuous set of projectors |x\u03b8 ihx\u03b8 |. Based on the measurement of the distributions\nw\u03c1\u0302 (x\u03b8 ) for all values of \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0] we can formally reconstruct the density operator according to the formula [15]\n\u0014 Z \u03c0\n\u0015\nZ \u221e\n1\nexp \u2212\nd\u03b8\ndx\u03b8 |x\u03b8 ihx\u03b8 |\u03bb(x\u03b8 ) ,\n(3.1)\n\u03c1\u0302r =\nZ0\n0\n\u2212\u221e\nwhere the Lagrange multipliers \u03bb(x\u03b8 ) are given by an infinite set of equations\n\u221a\nw\u03c1\u0302 (x\u03b8 ) = 2\u03c0hx\u03b8 |\u03c1\u0302r |x\u03b8 i;\n\u2200x\u03b8 \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, \u221e).\n\n(3.2)\n\nIf the distributions w\u03c1\u0302 (x\u03b8 ) are measured for all values of x\u03b8 and all angles \u03b8 then the density operator \u03c1\u0302r is reconstructed\nprecisely and is equal to density operator obtained with the help of the inverse Radon transformation or with the help\nof the pattern functions (for more details see [15]).\nIn practical experimental situation (e.g., see the experiments by Raymer et al. [16] and by Mlynek et al. [17])\nit is impossible to measure the distributions w\u03c1\u0302 (x\u03b8 ) for all values of x\u03b8 and all angles \u03b8. What is measured are\ndistributions (histograms) for finite number N\u03b8 quadrature angles \u03b8 and the finite number Nx of \"bins\" for quadrature\noperators. This means that practical experiments are associated with an observation level specified by a finite number\nof observables\n(j)\n\n(j)\n\nF\u0302jk = |x\u03b8k ihx\u03b8k |\n\n(3.3)\n\nwith the number of quadrature angles equal to N\u03b8 and the number of bins for each quadrature equal to Nx . We\ncan therefore assume that from the measurement of the observables F\u0302jk the meanvalues F jk are determined (these\nmeanvalues correspond to \"discretized\" quadrature distributions). In addition it is usually the case that the mean\nexcitation number of the state is known (measured) as well.\nThe operators F\u0302jk together with n\u0302 form a specific observation level corresponding to the incomplete tomographic\nmeasurement. In this case we can express the generalized canonical density operator in the form\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nN\u03b8\nNx X\nX\n1\n\u03c1\u0302r = exp \uf8ed\u2212\u03bbn n\u0302 \u2212\n(3.4)\n\u03bbj,k F\u0302jk \uf8f8\nZ\nj=1\nk=1\n\n3\n\n\fThe knowledge of the mean photon number is essential for the MaxEnt reconstruction because it formally regularizes\nthe MaxEnt reconstruction scheme (the generalized partition function is finite in this case).\n\nB. Motional states of atoms via MaxEnt principle: Formalism\n\nIn the quantum homodyne tomography the probability distributions are measured for the rotated quadrature\noperators x\u0302\u03b8 . The annihilation and creation operators of motional quanta, \u00e2 and \u00e2\u2020 , are related to the position\nand momentum operators, \u1e91 and p\u0302, via expressions \u1e91 = \u221a12 (\u00e2 + \u00e2\u2020 ) and p\u0302 = \u221a12 i(\u00e2 \u2212 \u00e2\u2020 ), respectively. The angle\n\u03b8 of the quadrature operator corresponds to \u03c9z \u03c4 and vertical \"cuts\" of the absorption images (taken after the BE)\ncan be associated with quadrature probability distributions. However, for a real physical situation with a nonzero\nrms size of the cloud the vertical \"cuts\" of absorption images correspond to a coarse-grained quadrature probability\ndistributions. In particular, the vertical cuts of measured absorption images (taken in 2D) give us (after integration\nalong the horizontal direction) the spatial distribution along the vertical axis. The spatial distribution along the\nvertical z axis can be expressed as\nZ\n\u22121\nF \u03c4 (z) = T\nF0 (\u03be0 )P\u03c4 ((z \u2212 \u03be0 )/T )d\u03be0 ,\n(3.5)\nwhere F0 (\u03be0 ) is the initial spatial distribution of the cloud in the z-direction (i.e., a Gaussian distribution with the\nrms size \u2206\u03be0 ). The function P\u03c4 (v) denotes the velocity probability distribution of the measured quantum state which\nhas been evolved for time \u03c4 in the harmonic potential before the BE, i.e.\nP\u03c4 (v) = |hv|\u03c8(\u03c4 )i|2 ,\n\n|\u03c8(\u03c4 )i = \u00db (\u03c4 )|\u03c8(0)i.\n\n(3.6)\n\nHere \u00db (\u03c4 ) = exp(\u2212i\u0124\u03c4 /h\u0304) represents the time-evolution operator for the harmonic oscillator with the Hamiltonian\n\u0124 = p\u03022 /2m + m\u03c9z2 \u1e91 2 /2. Now we can treat the measured \"cuts\" as the mean values of specific observables: F \u03c4 (z) =\nTr [\u03c1\u0302F\u0302\u03c4 (z)]. In practice just a few discrete times \u03c4j (j = 1, . . . , N\u03c4 ) are considered and the z coordinate is discretized\ninto the bins zk (k = \u2212Nz , . . . , Nz ) of a given resolution \u2206z. The set of operators which enters the equation (3.4) for\nthe MaxEnt reconstruction then takes the form\n\u001d\u001c\nZ\nzk \u2212 \u03be0\nzk \u2212 \u03be0\n\u22121\n\u2020\nF\u0302\u03c4j (zk ) = T\nF0 (\u03be0 )\u00db (\u03c4j )\n\u00db (\u03c4j )d\u03be0\n(j = 1, . . . , N\u03c4 ; k = \u2212Nz , . . . , Nz ).\n(3.7)\nT\nT\nWe have already commented that the operator of mean phonon number n\u0302 is added to the set of observables {F\u0302\u03c4j (zk )}.\nKnowledge of the mean excitation number n\u0304 is essential in the case of an incomplete set of observables [11]. Knowledge\nof the mean excitation number leads to a natural \"truncation\" of the Hilbert space. The inclusion of the mean phonon\nnumber into the MaxEnt reconstruction scheme does not represent its limitation as the mean energy represents one\nof basic characteristics of any system which should be inferred from the measurement.\nThe experimental \"cuts\" of the BE absorption images [F\u0302\u03c4j (z)] can be taken at few selected times, for example\n\u03c9z \u03c4j = 0, \u03c0/4, \u03c0/2, 3\u03c0/4 (N\u03c4 = 4). To perform the reconstruction we have to determine the Lagrange multipliers\n{\u03bbj,k } and \u03bbn associated with {F\u0302\u03c4j (zk )} and n\u0302, respectively, in the expression for the generalized canonical density\noperator (3.4). The Lagrange multipliers can be determined via the minimization of a deviation function \u2206F with\nrespect to the measured data, i.e.\n\u2206F =\n\nX\nj,k\n\nn\n\u0011o2\n\u0010\nwj,k F \u03c4j (zk ) \u2212 Tr \u03c1\u0302r F\u0302\u03c4j (zk )\n2\n\n+ wn\u0304 {n\u0304 \u2212 Tr (\u03c1\u0302r n\u0302)} .\n\n(3.8)\n\nHere {wj,k } and wn\u0304 represent positive weight factors for particular observables. Without any prior knowledge about\nthe state we can take for simplicity wi,j = 1. The weight factor wn\u0304 associated with the mean phonon number can\nbe chosen according to our preference either to fit better the \"cuts\" of the BE images or the mean phonon number.\nIn the case of the perfect measurement and the complete reconstruction the result has to be independent of the\nchoice of the weight factors (in this case we can take wn\u0304 = 1). The weight factors could be also associated with the\nprior information about the dispersion of the measured observables. In particular, the weight factors can be taken as\nw\u03bd \u223c \u03c3\u03bd\u22122 to reflect the knowledge of variances \u03c3\u03bd for the measured observables \u011c\u03bd . When the mean values of the\nobservables for the MaxEnt estimate \u03c1\u0302r fit within desired interval G\u03bd \u00b1 \u03c3\u03bd then contributions of the observables to\n4\n\n\fthe deviation function \u2206F are of the same order (\u223c 1). However, in our case we do not assume the knowledge of\nvariances for the measured discretized probability distributions (taking w\u03bd = 1).\nOnce the Lagrange multipliers are numerically fitted, the result of the reconstruction \u2013 the generalized canonical\ndensity operator \u03c1\u0302r \u2013 can be visualized, for example, via the corresponding Wigner function [18] which can be defined\nas a particular Fourier transform of the density operator \u03c1\u0302 of a harmonic oscillator expressed in the basis of the\neigenvectors |qi of the position operator q\u0302:\nZ \u221e\nW\u03c1\u0302 (q, p) \u2261\nd\u03b6hq \u2212 \u03b6/2|\u03c1\u0302|q + \u03b6/2ieip\u03b6 .\n(3.9)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nC. Numerical simulation\n\nTo test our reconstruction procedure\n\u221a let us consider the reconstruction of the Wigner function of the motional\nquantum state |\u03c8(0)i = (|0i + |1i)/ 2 of Cs atoms trapped in the optical lattice. This kind of states has been\ndemonstrated in recent experiments [5]. We assume the following setup parameters: \u03c9z /2\u03c0 = 80 kHz, the rms size\nof the ground state \u2206z0 = 22 nm, the rms velocity width \u2206p0 /m = 11 mm/s and the rms width of the cloud of the\natoms about 60 \u03bcm. Before BE (with BE time T = 8.7 ms) the atoms evolve within the harmonic trapping potential\nfor \u03c4 = 0, 1.6, 3.2, 4.8 \u03bcs. As the input for the reconstruction via the MaxEnt principle four vertical \"ideal\" cuts of the\nBE absorption images are taken as shown in insets of Fig. 1. In addition, for the phonon number operator n\u0302 which is\nincluded in the set of measured observables (see discussion above) we assume the mean value n\u0304 = 0.5. The result of\nthe ideal reconstruction is shown in Fig. 1.

Numerical simulation of the reconstruction of the Wigner function of the motional quantum state (|0i + |1i)/ 2 of\nCs atoms trapped in the optical lattice (assuming \u03c9z /2\u03c0 = 80 kHz, the rms size of the ground state \u2206z0 = 22 nm and the rms\nvelocity width \u2206p0 /m = 11 mm/s). As shown in insets for the reconstruction via the MaxEnt principle four vertical cuts of\nthe absorption images (with BE time T = 8.7 ms) have been taken. The histograms in the insets correspond to the measured\ndata while the solid lines are obtained from the reconstructed Wigner function (i.e. they correspond to reconstructed marginal\ndistrubutions). Before BE the atoms evolve within the trapping potential for the times \u03c4 = 0, 1.6, 3.2, 4.8 \u03bcs. In addition, the\nmean number of motional quanta n\u0304 = 0.5 and the rms width of the cloud of the atoms about 60 \u03bcm have been assumed.\n\nObviously, in a real measurement the measured values are always fluctuating around the exact ones due to an\nexperimental noise. Therefore we simulate a non-ideal measurement introducing random fluctuations to the measured\n5\n\n\fvalues of observables.

Despite of a significant relative error the reconstruction is almost perfect with\nthe fidelity of the measured and the reconstructed states still close to one (\u2206F = 0.16, entropy S = 0.01, \u2206\u03c1 = 0.05).\nThe minimum value of the deviation function \u2206F = 0.16 can serve also as a measure of the imperfection of the given\nmeasurement (due to a technical noise) [20].\n2=0\n\n2=1.6\n\ns\n\nintensity [a.u.]\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n-400\n\n0.0\n-400\n\n-200\n\n0\n2=3.2\n\n200\n\n400\n\nintensity [a.u.]\n\nW(p,q)\n\n-200\n\n0\n2=4.8\n\ns\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\ns\n\n0.4\n\n200\n\n400\n\n200\n\n400\n\ns\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n-400\n\n0.0\n-400\n\n-200\n\n0\n\nz [ m]\n\n200\n\n400\n\n-200\n\n0\n\nz [ m]\n\n0\n4\n2\n\n-4\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n0\n\nq/q0\n\n2\n\np/p\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n4 -4\n\nFIG. 2. \u221a Numerical simulation of the reconstruction of the Wigner function of the atomic motional quantum state\n(|0i + |1i)/ 2 for the same settings as in Fig. 1. Four vertical cuts of the absorption images taken for reconstruction (see\nthe insets) are fluctuating randomly around their ideal values shown in Fig. 1 with the relative error \u03b7 = 0.1. In addition, the\nmean phonon number n\u0304\u2032 = 0.6 has been considered.\n\nA typical non-classical state which we can utilize for a further test is the even coherent state\n\u221a Ne (|\u03b1i+|\u2212\u03b1i) which\u22128is\na superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases [19]. For the amplitude \u03b1 = 2 we obtained \u2206F = 10 ,\nthe entropy S = 0.026 and \u2206\u03c1 = 10\u22124 (under assumption that the exact mean phonon number n\u0304 = 1.928 is known).\nIn the case of the imperfect measurement with \u03b7 = 0.1 the reconstruction leads to \u2206F = 0.14, entropy S = 0.13, and\n\u2206\u03c1 = 0.06 for n\u0304 = 2.09. The fidelity of the reconstructed and the measured states is in this case also close to one.\nIn order to model a technical noise in the measurement we have been considered Gaussian fluctuations proportional\nto the square root of the mean values. It means that tails of the \"cuts\" of BE images do not introduce a significant\nerror (compare insets in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). However, in the current measurements the situation seems to be different\nand the fluctuations do not decrease with the amplitude of the expected values.\nThe fundamental question in the context of the MaxEnt reconstruction of states from incomplete tomographic data\nis whether the quality of the reconstruction can be improved using additional data from subsequent time moments \u03c4\nand how many such time moments \u03c4 are required for the complete reconstruction of the unknown state \u03c1\u0302. We have\nshown recently [15] that for the quantum tomography just three quadrature distribution are sufficient for a complete\nreconstruction using the MaxEnt principle (in the case of the perfect measurement). This corresponds to the ideal\ncase without the spatial dispersion of the cloud of atoms, i.e. the choice with \u03c9z \u03c4j = 0, \u03c0/4, \u03c0/2 (N\u03c4 = 3) is sufficient\nfor \u2206\u03be0 \u2192 0. Obviously, in experiments with neutral atoms the spatial size of the atomic cloud is nonzero. However,\nin the case of the ideal measurement three BE absorption images associated with three \"rotations\" \u03c9z \u03c4j are still\nsufficient for a complete reconstruction of tested examples of quantum states. On the other hand, it seems that for\nhigher mean phonon numbers the spatial distributions along the vertical axis which are directly determined from\n6\n\n\fabsorption images should be known with improving precision (and on a wider interval of values as well). In the above\nexamples we have considered for convenience BE images for four \"rotations\" (N\u03c4 = 4) which results in a very good\nreconstruction.\n2=0\n\n2=1.6\n\ns\n\nintensity [a.u.]\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n-400\n\n0.0\n-400\n\n-200\n\n0\n\n200\n\n2=3.2\n\n400\n\nintensity [a.u.]\n\nW(p,q)\n\n-200\n\n0\n2=4.8\n\ns\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\ns\n\n0.4\n\n200\n\n400\n\n200\n\n400\n\ns\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n-400\n\n0.0\n-400\n\n-200\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n-200\n\nz [ m]\n\n0\n\nz [ m]\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\nq/q0\n\n2\n\n4 -4\n\n-2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n4\n\np/p 0\n\nFIG. 3. \u221aNumerical simulation of the reconstruction of the Wigner function of the motional quantum state Ne (|\u03b1i + | \u2212 \u03b1i)\nwith \u03b1 = 2 for the case of the ideal measurement.

RECONSTRUCTION FROM EXPERIMENTAL DATA\n\nIn what follows we will apply the MaxEnt reconstruction scheme to the data obtained at the ENS in Paris [21].\nFirstly we note that the unknown quantum state should belong to a Hilbert subspace which can be determined easily.\nThus we can limit ourselves to the subspace spanned by Fock (number) states |0i, |1i, . . . |N \u2212 1i. The upper bound\non the accessible phonon number N is given by experimental limitations such as, for example, a feasible depth of\nmicro-wells of the optical lattice and the validity of the harmonic potential approximation. For recent experiments N\nhas been typically of the order of 10. This value is large enough to demonstrate the preparation of many non-classical\nstates but on the other hand excludes highly squeezed states from a coherent processing.\nLet us consider the experimental arrangement used in Paris [21] with the parameters: \u03c9z /2\u03c0 = 80 kHz, the rms\nsize of the ground state \u2206z0 = 22 nm, the rms velocity width \u2206p0 /m = 11 mm/s, the rms width of the cloud of the\natoms about 60 \u03bcm and BE time T = 8.7 ms. Initially the atoms are prepared in a well defined motional state |\u03c80 i\n(e.g. in the vacuum state |0i). Then the optical lattice is switched off for the time period t1 during which the atoms\nevolve freely towards the state |\u03c81 i = exp(\u2212it1 p\u03022 /2m)|\u03c80 i. Next, the optical lattice is again switched on for the time\n\u03c4 during which the atoms evolve within the harmonic trapping potential. The measurement is performed after the\nBE time. The first two stages can be considered as the preparation of the state |\u03c81 i.

From the experimental data we have inferred the mean number of motional quanta n\u0304 \u2248 1.0,\nwhile the reconstructed value is n\u0304\u2032 \u2248 1.1. Deviation of the measured and predicted values of observables is \u2206F = 0.09 and\nentropy of the reconstructed mixture state is S = 1.0.\n\nThe considered data are for the initial vacuum state which means that under ideal conditions a squeezed state\n|\u03c81 i = exp(\u2212it1 p\u03022 /2m)|0i should be prepared. The vertical spatial distributions obtained from the measured 2Dabsorption images are discretized into pixels (bins) with the pixel width 5.45 \u03bcm. The optical density of each pixel\nis averaged in the horizontal direction in which the absorption images are divided into 50 rows, each 3.9 \u03bcm wide\n(these rows cover the size of the cloud in the horizontal direction). For the reconstruction via the MaxEnt principle\nfour vertical spatial distributions for \"rotation\" times \u03c4 = 0, 1.6, 3.2 and 4.8 \u03bcs are taken. The selected times roughly\ncorrespond to rotations within the phase space by \u03c9z \u03c4 = 0, \u03c0/4, \u03c0/2 and 3\u03c0/4, respectively. Unfortunately, the\nmean excitation number n\u0302 for measured state |\u03c81 i was not measured explicitly in the experiment, therefore we have\nto estimate it as follows: During the free expansion period the rms size of the cloud increases by \u2206x = p0 \u03c41 /m.\nThe corresponding increase of the potential energy 21 m\u03c9z2 (\u2206x)2 in units h\u0304\u03c9z gives us the increase of the number\nof excitation quanta with respect to the initial state |\u03c80 i. For \u03c41 = 4 \u03bc and the initial vacuum it means n\u0304 \u2248 1.\nExperiments can be realized also for higher \u03c41 . For example, \u03c41 = 8 \u03bc leads to n\u0304 \u2248 4. However, as mentioned above,\n8\n\n\fsuch \"squeezed\" states with a significant contribution of higher phonon number states violate the underlying harmonic\napproximation for the potential. To keep a coherent control an an-harmonic part of the potential has to be taken into\naccount.\nThe result of the reconstruction via the MaxEnt principle is shown in Fig. 5. The deviation of the fitted and\nmeasured values is \u2206F = 0.09 and the entropy of the reconstructed state S = 1.0. It means that the reconstructed\nstate is a statistical mixture. We see a two peak structure which suggests that there is a mixture of two squeezed\nstates coherently displaced from each other. It is caused by the fact that the vertical center of the cloud was not\nfixed in the experiment and it has to be determined by our fit for each measured BE absorption image separately.\nAssuming a priori knowledge that the Wigner function has a symmetric shape with respect to the origin of the phase\nspace (i.e. there is no coherent amplitude) a Gaussian fit can be used to determine the center of the cloud for each\nvertical distribution. For states with a non-zero coherent amplitude the center of the cloud should be fixed already\nin the experiment.\nIt turns out that the reconstruction results do not describe the squeezed vacuum state as was originally expected\n[21]. The main reason is that the mean phonon number was not measured directly in the experiment. It can be\ninferred only indirectly from the ideal case without any incoherence during preparation or measurement. As we\ndiscussed above, it is essential to include the information about the mean number of vibrational quanta into the\nMaxEnt reconstruction scheme. In optical tomography the analogous information about mean photon number can be\nobtained from distributions of two \"orthogonal\" quadratures. In our case it could correspond to two absorption images\nsuch that \u03c9z (\u03c4j \u2212 \u03c4k ) = \u03c0/2. However, it would require a precise timing of the evolution within the harmonic trapping\npotential. Therefore the mean number of vibrational quanta should be determined in an independent measurement.\nAnother problem arises from a slow convergence of anti-squeezed spatial distributions which are derived directly\nfrom the measured absorption images. In particular, the convergence of tails is too slow for those \"rotations\" which\ncorresponds to anti-squeezed phases, i.e. \u03c4 = 1.6, 4.8 \u03bcs (see insets of Fig. 5). The slow convergence is reflected by the\npresence of non-negligible backgrounds for Gaussian fits to these spatial distributions. If we eliminate (subtract) these\nbackgrounds from the measured distributions the MaxEnt reconstruction gives almost the same Wigner function as\nin Fig. 5 but with a highly reduced deviation function \u2206F = 0.02 (comparing to \u2206F = 0.09 in Fig. 5). Such\nbackground in these absorption images can be caused by an incoherence associated with a violation of the the\nharmonic approximation. In fact, in our analysis we have neglected the change of the oscillation frequency along the\nz-axis. In recent experiments, the oscillation frequency decreases 10% from \u03c9z for micro-wells at the edge of the initial\ncloud.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented a very efficient reconstruction scheme for the reconstruction of motional states of atoms based\non the MaxEnt principle. The main advantage of the scheme is that it always results in reconstructions which are\nphysical states (unlike in the case of the maximum likelihood estimation which can results in nonphysical estimations).\nMoreover, the scheme is very efficient in a sense that it requires just a small number of tomographic phase-space cuts.\nWe have applied the scheme for a reconstruction of motional quantum states of neutral atoms. As an example have\nwe analyzed the experimental data obtained by by the group of C. Salomon at the ENS in Paris and we reconstruct\nthe Wigner function of motional quantum states of Cs atoms trapped in the optical lattice. In our analysis we have\nneglected the change of the oscillation frequency along z axis in recent experiments. The dispersion of the oscillation\nfrequency is of the order of a few percent. This source of errors can significantly affect the quality of a quantum state\npreparation and its reconstruction. In addition, only up to first 10 bound states of micro-wells of the optical lattice\ncan be approximated by a harmonic potential. It implies limits on coherent manipulations of quantum states. It\nmeans that states with a significant contribution of higher number (Fock) states cannot be prepared and manipulated\nin a controlled way.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by the European Union projects QUBITS and QUEST under the contracts IST-199913021 and HPRN-CT-2000-00121, respectively.
