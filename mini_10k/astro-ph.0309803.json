Booth\nTheoretical Physics, The Blackett Laboratory\nImperial College, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BZ, UK\nABSTRACT\nA prediction of standard Big Bang cosmology is that the observed UHECR\n(ultra-high-energy cosmic rays) spectrum will exhibit a cutoff at the GKZ limit,\nresulting from interaction with the photons that constitute the cosmic microwave\nbackground. We show that for the Quasi-Static Universe (QSU) model, in which\nphoton energy is an invariant in the cosmological reference frame, the photon\nnumber density in the universe today is a factor of 109 less than in the standard\nmodel. As a consequence, the mean free path of UHECRs will exceed the horizon\ndistance of the universe, rendering it essentially transparent to UHECRs. The\nQSU model therefore predicts that no cutoff will be observed in the UHECR\nspectrum.\nSubject headings: cosmic microwave background - cosmic rays - cosmology:\ntheory - scattering\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nExperiments to measure the flux of UHECR have detected a number of events with\nenergies > 1020 eV (Watson 2000). These observations present something of a puzzle. There\nare no obvious mechanisms within our galaxy that could accelerate UHECRs to these energies. It is reasonable to postulate potential extra-galactic sources of UHECRs, e.g. quasars,\nbut prevailing theory suggests that these particles should never reach the Earth because of\ninteractions with the photons that constitute the cosmic microwave background radiation\n(CMBR). This prediction was made independently by Greisen (1966) and by Zatsepin &\nKuzmin (1966), based on an analysis of the process p + \u03b3 \u2192 p + \u03c0 (assuming that the majority of UHECRs at these energy levels are protons). This showed that UHECRs with energies\n> 5 \u00d7 1019 would exceed the energy threshold for photopion production (the GZK cutoff).\nTaking into account the collision cross section for the photopion reaction, and the CMBR\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nphoton density, the mean free path for these UHECRs would be of the order of 1023 m (see\nAppendix A for analysis), implying that they could not have originated from sources outside\nour galaxy.\nThe present generation of UHECR experiments, such as AGASA and HiRes, are not\nable to generate a large enough sample from the relatively low flux of UHECRs at these high\nenergies (De Marco, Blasi & Olinto 2003). The low statistical significance of the few observations of UHECRs with energies > 1020 eV means that no firm conclusions can be drawn\nat this stage. Larger experiments are planned, such as the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO)\nand EUSO, which will increase the number of detected events by 2 orders of magnitude.\nOnly then will it be possible to to prove conclusively whether or not the predicted GZK\ncutoff feature is present in the UHECR spectrum. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to evaluate\npotential cosmological scenarios that might result in the detection of significant UHECR flux\nabove the presumed GZK cutoff.\nThere have been suggestions that the observed UHECRs with energies > 1020 eV might\nbe due to Lorentz symmetry breaking (Kifune 1999; Magueijo & Smolin 2002), or deformation\nof Lorentz symmetry (Amelino-Camelia 2002). These predictions are based on a class of\nmodels that postulate deviations from standard special relativity for particles that have\nattained very high energies, such that m/R < E/EP , where m and E are respectively the\nparticle mass and total energy, and EP is the Planck energy. These are generally referred to\nas Double Special Relativity (DSR) models. The main criticism of this approach is that it\nrequires either a preferred class of inertial observers, or an ad-hoc construction of the Lorentz\ndeformation function to generate predicted effects that would result in a shift of the GZK\ncutoff.\nAn alternative solution to the GZK cutoff problem is proposed in the following sections,\nbased on a significantly lower CMB photon number density that arises naturally from an\nalternative cosmological model (Booth 2002).\n\n2.\n\nThe Quasi-Static Universe model\n\nThe Quasi-Static Universe (QSU)is used here as a shorthand to refer to the paradigm\ndescribed in Booth (2002). The main feature of this model is that the Planck scale is\ndecoupled from the atomic scale conventionally used as the as the basis for our measurement\nsystem. The changes in the dynamical behaviour of the universe that result from this\nmodification can not only account for most of the problems associated with the Big Bang\nmodel, but are also able provide a very simple explanation for the apparent acceleration of the\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nexpansion rate of the universe that has been observed in various high redshift supernovae\nstudies in recent years. One of the principal consequences of the QSU paradigm is that\nthe atomic scale, as defined by the de Broglie wavelength of sub-atomic particles, is not\nan appropriate reference frame for measuring gravitational phenomena or the behaviour of\nphotons. The QSU model is based on the postulate that the correct reference frame for these\nphenomena is in fact a cosmological frame based on the mass and size of universe as a whole.\nIn such a frame, photons do not undergo any change in frequency, since as far as they are\nconcerned, the universe is static. Hence, it is not meaningful to talk in terms of photons\nlosing energy in this reference frame. In transforming from the cosmological reference frame\nto our conventional atomic frame, photons will be perceived to exhibit a redshift as the scale\nfactor of the universe with respect to the atomic frame increases with time. The crucial\ndifference between the QSU model and the conventional formalism is that the relationship\nE\u03b3 = h\u03bd no longer holds true for photons emitted at times t < t0 , where t0 signifies the\npresent time. The energy of such 'old' photons will remain constant, at the same value they\npossessed when they were first emitted. However their power, i.e. the energy transferred\nper unit time, will be reduced in proportion to their redshift, such that W = W0 .\u03bd/\u03bd0 ,\nwhere W0 and \u03bd0 are respectively the photon power and frequency at the time of emission.\nClearly, such a modification to one the most fundamental equations in physics will have a\nvery significant impact on any phenomena that involve redshifted photons, and in particular,\nthe CMBR.\nTo understand the implications of the QSU model for the CMBR, we need to review\nthe way in which the standard Planck black-body distribution law is applied. A summary\nof the standard derivation of this law is provided in Appendix B. Present day observations\nof the CMB give a value for the energy density of U \u2243 4 \u00d7 10\u221214 Jm\u22123 , which from (B4)\ncorresponds to a temperature of T = 2.7\u25e6 K. Conventionally, the next step is to take this\ntemperature and use equation (B6) to calculate the photon number density, giving a result\nof N \u2243 4 \u00d7 108 m\u22123 . However, these formulae are only valid for black-body radiation that\nis in equilibrium with its surroundings. It would be perfectly correct to use these equations\nif we wished to deduce the photon number density for a black-body with this temperature\ntoday. In erroneously applying them in the context of the relic CBMR generated by the Big\nBang, we are perpetuating the assumption inherent in going from (B3) to (B5) - that photon\nenergy is always equal to h\u03bd.\nIn the QSU model, red-shifted photons do not lose energy, so it is not possible to\ndetermine the energy of an observed photon merely by measuring its frequency. It is also\nnecessary to know the thermal history of the photon, i.e. its frequency when it was originally\nemitted. It is this that determines the energy of the photon. In order to obtain the correct\nresult for the photon number density today that corresponds to an observed energy density,\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nwe need to correct for the fact that the photon energy h\u03bd applied in going from (B3) to (B5)\nshould reflect the energy at the time of emission, or more precisely, its energy at the time it\nwas in black-body equilibrium with its surroundings.\nWe therefore need to apply a factor of Tobs /Tequi to the expression for photon number\ndensity in (B5), where of Tobs is the observed absolute temperature of the CMBR today, and\nTequi is the temperature at the time of black-body equilibrium. Clearly we do not know this\nfigure with any precision. However we can take an educated guess that is at least consistent\nwith other observational data and with plausible models for primordial nucleosynthesis.\nOne such model is the neutron decay variant of the Cold Big Bang (CBB), which predicts a\nmaximum reaction temperature of \u2248 1010 K, with an equilibrium temperature of the order of\n\u2248 109 K. Applying the correction factor to equation (B6) gives a calculated photon number\ndensity of \u2248 0.3m\u22123 - a factor of \u223c 109 lower than for the standard Hot Big Bang (HBB)\nmodel. This is very close to the measured baryon number density of the universe, giving\n\u03b7\u03b3 \u2243 1.\n3.\n\nImplications for cosmological processes\n\nHaving established that the value of \u03b7\u03b3 in the QSU model is many orders of magnitude\nless than the conventionally accepted value, the natural question to ask is: how does this\naffect other cosmological processes?\n\n3.1.\n\nPrimordial nucleosynthesis\n\nArguably, one of the process most sensitive to changes in \u03b7\u03b3 is that of primordial nucleosynthesis. Applying the conventional value of \u03b7\u03b3 \u2243 2 \u00d7 109 to the standard model for HBB\nnucleosynthesis results in predicted element abundances that are in good accord with observational data. Relatively small changes in \u03b7\u03b3 will result in large changes to the predicted\nabundances, and would therefore appear not to be compatible with observations. However,\nit has been pointed out by Aguirre (2001) that, provided that appropriate changes are made\nto a range of initial parameters, including \u03b7\u03b3 , it is possible to construct alternative models\nfor primordial nucleosynthesis that will produce predicted element abundances that are in\naccord with observational data. One such model is the CBB, which takes a value of \u03b7\u03b3 \u223c 1\nas one of its initial conditions. It is perhaps worth mentioning in passing that the neutron\ndecay variant of the CBB model predicts a photon energy of 0.78MeV , giving a baryon to\nphoton energy ratio of E\u03b3 /EB \u2243 1200. Under the QSU scenario, this ratio should persist\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nfrom the nucleosynthesis epoch to the present day, and indeed, the observed value of E\u03b3 /EB\nis very close to this value.\n\n3.2.\n\nHydrogen ionization\n\nAnother astrophysical measurement that is linked to \u03b7\u03b3 is the hydrogen ionization fraction. As the universe expands and cools, protons recombine with electrons to form neutral\nhydrogen when the energy of CMB photons falls below the hydrogen ionization energy threshold. The equilibrium ionization fraction \u03c7e as a function of temperature is give by the Saha\nequation\n\u221a\n\u0012 \u00133\n1 \u2212 \u03c7e\n4 2\u03c2(3) T 2 B/T\ne\n= \u221a\n\u03c7e\n\u03c0\u03b7\u03b3\nme\n\n(1)\n\nfrom which it can be see that the ionization fraction is also dependent on \u03b7\u03b3 . The\nionization fraction can be expressed as a function of redshift using the relation T = 2.73(1 +\nz)K. This is plotted in Figure 1 for a standard HBB cosmology with \u03b7\u03b3 = 2 \u00d7 109 , and\na CBB cosmology with \u03b7\u03b3 = 1. This illustrates that a reduction in the photon to baryon\nratio will cause recombination to take place at a much lower redshift, with the surface of last\nscattering for the CMB occurring at z \u2243 2400, as compared to z \u2243 1100 for the standard\nmodel.\nAt first sight it might be expected that such a change should inevitably result in very\nsignificant modifications to the observed CMB angular power spectrum. However, an analysis of the dynamics of the two cosmological models reveals that the linear expansion of a\nCBB universe, in comparison to the rapid initial expansion rate of a standard model HBB\nuniverse, results in the epoch of creation of the last scattering surface being similar, in terms\nof coordinate time, for both cosmologies. Further detailed numerical analysis is required,\nusing a package such as CMBFAST, in order to accurately determine the nature of the impact on the predicted CMB angular power spectrum arising from a \u03b7\u03b3 = 1 cosmological\nmodel. Nevertheless, initial indications are that such a model may well be consistent with\nthe observed CMB angular power spectrum.\n\n3.3.\n\nReassessment of the GZK cutoff\n\nThe interaction between CMB photons and UHECRs is dependent on three factors:\nthe photon energy, the capture cross-section for the photon-proton collision, and the photon\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nnumber density. We shall now examine how each of these factors varies in a CBB universe.\nFrom (A4) it might be anticipated that if each CMB photon in a QSU is a factor of \u223c 109\nmore energetic than its counterpart in a standard HBB universe, then the threshold energy\nfor the photon-proton reaction will be reduced from \u223c 1020 eV to \u223c 1011 eV . However, this is\nunlikely to be the case here since energy transfer from the CMBR photon to the proton will\nbe dependent on the photon power, rather than its total energy. Since the photon power\nis, as in the standard case, proportional to h\u03bd, there will be no change in the GZK cutoff\nthreshold under the QSU scenario.\nThe next factor to consider is the collision cross-section for the photon-proton interaction. As discussed in Appendix A, this varies by a factor of \u223c 5 between energies corresponding to the main \u2206+ resonance peak and higher photon energy levels. It is not, therefore, a\nsignificant factor in differentiating between the two cosmological scenarios.\nFinally, we must consider the impact of the CMB photon number density on the mean\nfree path of the UHECRs. Under the QSU model, the CMBR photon number density is a\nfactor of \u223c 109 less than for the HBB model. From (A6), taking a value for \u03c3 = 100\u03bcbarn,\nand n = 0.2m\u22123 , gives a value for the mean free path of \u03bb = 1032 m. This is several\norders of magnitude greater than the horizon distance of the universe. The universe is\ntherefore effectively transparent to UHECRs, and the QSU model predicts that there will\nbe no observable reduction in the flux of UHECRs as a result of the GZK cutoff.\n\n4.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe reduced CMB photon number density predicted by the QSU model provides a\nnatural explanation for the observed UHECR flux with energies > 1020 eV . However, the\nstatistical significance of the measurements obtained from the existing AGASA and HiRes\nexperiments is still to low to provide conclusive evidence for the presence or absence of the\nGZK cutoff feature. For this, we will have to wait for the results from the next generation\nof UHECR experiments, such as PAO and EUSO.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nA.\n\nThe photon-proton reaction\n\nThe principal reaction contributing to the attenuation of UHECRs is the interaction\nwith CMB photons\np + \u03b3 \u2192 \u2206+ \u2192 p + \u03c0 0\n+\n\np+\u03b3 \u2192 \u2206 \u2192n+\u03c0\n\n+\n\n(A1)\n(A2)\n\nThe reaction will proceed when the combined centre-of-mass energy of the proton and photon\nis equal to or greater than the sum of the pion and proton (or neutron) mass, which can be\nexpressed as\n\u0010q\n\u0011\nm2\u03c0\n2\n2\nmp m\u03c0 +\n\u2264q\np + mp \u2212 p cos \u03b8\n2\n\n(A3)\n\nwhere q is the photon momentum along the x-axis and p is the momentum of the proton\nhitting the photon at an angle of \u03b8 in the xy plane. Since the pion mass is much smaller\nthan the proton (or neutron) mass, this expression can be simplified to\nEp \u2212 p cos \u03b8 \u2265\n\nmp m\u03c0\nq\n\n(A4)\n\nFor a thermal gas of relativistic bosons hqi \u223c 2.7T , and with TCM BR \u2243 2.7K, corresponding to an energy of 2.3 \u00d7 10\u22124 eV , inserting the pion and proton rest masses gives a\ncut-off energy of\nEp \u223c 1020 eV\n\n(A5)\n\nThis defines the Greisen Zatsepin Kuzmin (GZK) limit.\nThe mean free path for this reaction is given by\n\u03bb=\n\n1\nn\u03c3\n\n(A6)\n\nwhere \u03c3 is the capture cross-section for the p\u03b3CM BR reaction, and n is the number density\nof CMBR photons. \u03c3 varies from a maximum of \u223c 500\u03bcbarn at the main \u2206+ resonance to\na level of \u223c 100\u03bcbarn at higher energy levels (see for example (M\u00fccke et al 1999)).\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nB.\n\nBlack Body Radiation\n\nPlanck's black-body distribution law can be derived in two steps. First, by considering\nthe number of radiation modes that can be supported in a black-body cavity of unit volume,\nan expression for the mode density can be obtained\n\ndN(\u03bd) =\n\n8\u03c0\u03bd 2\nd\u03bd\nc3\n\n(B1)\n\nThe energy density as a function of frequency can then be calculated by multiplying the\nmode density by the average energy per mode. In classical terms this would simply be kT ,\nwhere k is the Boltzmann factor and T is the absolute temperature. However, the quantum\nnature of photons results in the probability distribution being skewed, so that the correct\nmean energy per mode must be calculated from the Boltzmann distribution, giving\nh\u03bd\n\u0112 = h\u03bd\n(B2)\n/\ne kT \u2212 1\nCombining (B1 and (B2) we obtain the final form of Planck's law for the energy density\nof black-body radiation as a function of frequency\nd\u03bd\n8\u03c0h\u03bd 3\n. h\u03bd\n3\nc\ne /kT \u2212 1\n\ndU(\u03bd) =\n\n(B3)\n\nThe total energy density per unit volume is then simply obtained by integrating (B3)\nto give\n8\u03c0 5 k 4 T 4\nU=\n(B4)\n15c3 h3\nThe final expression for the photon number density as a function of frequency is merely\n(B3) divided by the photon energy, h\u03bd\n\ndN(\u03bd) =\n\n8\u03c0\u03bd 2\nd\u03bd\n. h\u03bd\n3\nc e /kT \u2212 1\n\n(B5)\n\nThe photon number density per unit volume is therefore given by\nd\u03bd\n8\u03c0\u03bd 2\n.\nh\u03bd\nc3 e /kT \u2212 1\n0\n3 3\n16\u03c0k T \u03b6(3)\n=\nc3 h3\n\nN =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n(B6)\n(B7)\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nREFERENCES\nAguirre, A. 2001, Phys.Rev.
