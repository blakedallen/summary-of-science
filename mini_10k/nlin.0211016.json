The external field is purely classical, we ignore relativistic corrections, and assume an\ninfinite proton mass. Dropping the \u2013 for our purposes negligible \u2013 ponderomotive energy shift [3],\nand restricting to the dipole approximation, the Hamiltonian (in atomic units, and applying the\nvelocity gauge [3]) reads as\n1 F pz\n1\nsin(\u03c9t).\n(1)\nH = p~ 2 \u2212 \u2212\n2\nr\n\u03c9\nOur method of a combined application of the Floquet theorem and of complex scaling [4] allows an\nexact description of the quantum dynamics of the hydrogen atom, and fully includes the Coulomb\nsingularity, as well as the field-induced coupling to the atomic continuum. Our only restriction here\nis a confinement of the electron to a one-dimensional configuration space along the polarization\naxis of the external field. The approximation of reduced dimensionality is reasonable for quasione-dimensional Rydberg states for which the electronic motion is essentially confined along the\npolarization axis [5].\nThe coupling to the atomic continuum induced by the external field forces all bound states to turn\ninto resonances. These resonances are eigensolutions of the associated scattering problem, which\nsatisfies purely outgoing (Siegert-)boundary conditions [6], and they are characterized by quasienergies \u01eb with a resonance width \u0393\u01eb . In our approach, these quasi-energies are obtained by the\nmethod of complex scaling, and are given by the complex eigenvalues \u01eb = Re(\u01eb) \u2212 i\u0393\u01eb/2 of the scaled\nFloquet Hamiltonian. The ionization probability of the initial \u2013 field free \u2013 Rydberg state |n0 i with\nprincipal quantum number n0 is completely defined by the ionization widths (or rates) \u0393\u01eb of the\nindividual Floquet eigenstates of the atom in the field. Assuming rapid switching of the microwave\nfield, the weights w\u01eb of the individual Floquet states are simply given by their time-averaged overlaps\nwith |n0 i. Consequently, the ionization probability reads as [4]\nPIon (t)\n\n= 1 \u2212 Pbound (t)\nX\n= 1\u2212\ne\u2212\u0393\u01eb t w\u01eb ,\n\n(2)\n\n\u01eb\n\nwhere t is the total interaction time of the atom with the driving field. The sum in (2) runs over\nthe entire Floquet spectrum.\nIn the same way as the electronic transport through a disordered solid is described by its transmission\nproperties or the conductance [2], respectively, we define an atomic conductance g [7] to allow for a\nstatistical characterization of the energy transport in periodically driven atoms. g is given by the\nweighted sum of the ionization rates \u0393\u01eb , which represent the atomic analogue of the transmission\nrates through a disordered solid-state sample. From (2), it follows that\ng\u2261\n\n1 d\n1 X\n\u0393\u01eb w\u01eb =\n\u2206 \u01eb\n\u2206 dt\n\nPIon (t),\n\n(3)\n\nt\u22430\n\nwith \u2206 being the mean level spacing of the Floquet spectrum. An estimate for \u2206 is obtained [7] by\n\u2206\u2261\n\n\u03c9\n,\nN\n\nwhere N \u2261 1/(2n20 \u03c9) counts the number of photons the atom must absorb in order to ionize.\n1\n\n(4)\n\n\f2\n\n2.1\n\n2.2\n\n2.3\n\n2.4\n\n2.5\n\n\u22122\n\u22126\n\nlng(\u03c90)\n\n\u22124\n\n<lng>\n\n\u22126\n\n\u221210\n\u221214\n\n\u03c90\n\n\u22128\n\u221210\n\u221212\n\u221214\n\u221216\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n1/l\nFigure 1: Averaged values of the natural logarithm of the atomic conductance g vs. the inverse\nlocalization ratio 1/l (initial states n0 = 40 (triangles), 60 (stars), 70 (squares), 90 (diamonds), 100\n(circles), l = 0.1 \u2212 2). Each data point is obtained by averaging over an ensemble of 500 different\nsamples (with the frequency measured in units of the classical, undisturbed Kepler frequency \u03c90 \u2261\n\u03c9 \u00d7 n30 \u2208 [2.0; 2.5]). For the initial principal quantum number n0 = 100 we observe an almost\nlinear dependence along the inserted straight line (dashed-dotted), a result which is also obtained\nfor disordered solid-state models in the localized regime [8]. There is a clear trend to approach the\nlinear behaviour \u2013 which one expects from the theory of dynamical localization \u2013 as n0 increases\nfrom 40 to 100. The inset shows the huge fluctuations of g \u2013 on a logarithmic scale! \u2013 as a function\nof the external (scaled) frequency, for l = 0.2 and n0 = 100 (corresponding to the data point marked\nby the arrow in the main figure).\nDespite the fully deterministic dynamics which are generated by (1), the widths \u0393\u01eb and the overlaps\nw\u01eb are very sensitive to slight changes of the field parameters. This behaviour forces the ionization probability and the conductance, respectively, to strongly fluctuate as we vary, for instance,\nthe microwave frequency. The observed huge fluctuations (cf. inset in fig. 1) are the analogue of\nconductance fluctuations known from condensed matter physics [2], where disorder induced interference effects lead to an exponential localization of the electronic wave function along the lattice, and\ntherefore to a strong reduction of the transmission through the solid. In both, the atomic and the\nsolid-state problem, a statistical description is needed for characterizing this complex transport behaviour. Extreme fluctuations typically occur in a regime where the overall \u2013 atomic or mesoscopic \u2013\nconductance is exponentially small. Then, the theory of dynamical localization [9], which was developed in close analogy to the concept of Anderson localization in condensed matter physics, predicts\nan exponential decrease of the bound-state population distribution towards the atomic continuum\nthreshold. This decay is completely characterized by the ratio of the localization length \u03be (which\nmeasures the width of the bound-state distribution) to N . We quantitatively check this prediction\nof dynamical localization by plotting the logarithmic atomic conductance ln g vs. the inverse ratio\nl\u22121 \u2261 N/\u03be. For very high initial Rydberg sates, with principal quantum numbers close to 100, we\nobserve an exponential decrease of the atomic conductance (cf. fig. 1). However, for smaller n0 ,\nour results clearly show systematic deviations from the exponential behaviour. The same deviations\nare observable by looking at the statistical properties of the atomic conductance [10]. Keeping the\nratio l fixed and changing the frequency of the externally applied field in 500 equidistant, small\nsteps, we obtain an ensemble of 500 different \"samples\" for each value of n0 and l. Fig. 2 shows the\nlog-normal distributions of the atomic conductance, which is in good agreement with the predictions\nof solid-state models [11]. Again, the deviation of the distributions are the larger from the expected\nlog-normal behaviour, the smaller we have chosen the initial principal quantum number n0 .\nThe crucial insight gained from our study of the statistical properties of the atomic conductance\ng is that the initial Rydberg state defines an additional parameter n0 \u223c ~\u22121\neff [12] (as compared\nto the scenario in Anderson-localized solids) which non-trivially affects the statistical behaviour\n2\n\n\f0.5\n\nP(lng)\n\n0.4\n\nn0=40\n\nn0=60\n\nn0=80\n\nn0=100\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\u221214\n\n\u221210\n\n\u22126\n\n\u221214\n\n\u221210\n\n\u22126\n\nlng\n\nFigure 2: Direct comparison of the statistical distributions of ln g (histograms) and the corresponding\nGaussian fits (thick lines), for the initial states n0 = 40, 60, 80, 100 (localization ratio l = 0.2). As the\nprincipal quantum number n0 increases at constant l, a manifest improvement of the approximation\nby the fits, and a trend to shift to lower mean values is visible. Similar results are obtained for the\nentire localized region l < 0.5.\nof the atomic transport process. Furthermore, the observed fluctuations prove to be quite robust\nwith respect to slight uncertainties in the applied field strengths (the main problem in laboratory\nexperiments [13]), calling for a direct experimental verifications of our numerical results.\n\nReferences\n[1] S.
