This was first noted through the analysis of\nsupernovae [1, 2] and more recently using cosmic microwave background and baryonic acoustic oscillations\n[3\u20135]. Most analyses have demonstrated that a cosmological constant is in good agreement with data [4, 6\u20138],\nhowever, one may easily imagine models which could allow for generalizations beyond a simple cosmological constant. Before we start parametrizing generalized models,\nor fitting new free parameters, it is important to carefully\nconsider and remove known effects.\nOne effect, which has not received much attention in\nthis context, arises from the merging between dark matter structures and is always present in a bottom-up formation scenario of cosmological structures. This effect\ninduces an effective pressure between cosmological structures, which in principle may lead to systematic errors in\nthe interpretation of the cause of the acceleration. We\nwill now discuss the origin of this effect.\nWhen a dark matter structure is formed and equilibrated, either through merging or accretion, it has to\nobey the virial theorem. The virial theorem quantifies\nthe connection between the potential energy and the kinetic energy of the entire structure, 2K + W = 0, where\nK is the total kinetic energy, and W is the total potential energy [9]. For instance, if a structure is formed\nby bringing cold particles in from infinity (i.e. initially\nKinit = Winit = 0), then the virial theorem implies that\nan energy corresponding to the resulting total kinetic energy, K, must be disposed of [10]. For non-radiative dark\nmatter particles this means that a significant number of\nparticles typically are ejected with high momentum.\nIn this Letter we explain and estimate this effect. We\nfind that it indeed may have a significant contribution\nto the redshift dependent acceleration of the expansion.\nSince this is an unavoidable effect, we emphasize the need\nfor a careful calculation of its affect on the cosmological\nexpansion.\n\nII.\n\nEFFECTIVE REPULSION\n\nLet us consider a system of 3 equilibrated dark matter\nstructures, 2 large and 1 small. The 2 large structures are\nplaced at a large distance from each other, for instance\nat 100 times their virial radius. The small structure,\ncalled A, is placed close to one of the large structures,\ncalled B, for instance at 5 times the virial radius. A is\ngiven the circular velocity such that it is orbiting B in a\nstable circular orbit. The total force on the other large\nstructure, called C, is given by the total gravity from A\nand B.\nNow, let us consider a slightly different configuration,\nnamely one where A is given the same speed as before,\nbut directed towards B. This implies that after a few dynamical times A is essentially engulfed by B, and the 2\nstructures A and B will reach a new equilibrium configuration. The particles originating from A now sit at a\ndeeper potential, and they therefore have higher kinetic\nenergy on average.\nAt the end of this equilibration the virial theorem must\nhold, and therefore approximately half the total change\nin energy must have been disposed of. If the structures\nare composed of collisionless and non-radiative particles,\nthen that energy can only be radiated away by \"sacrificing\" some of the incoming particles, or by increasing its\nsize slightly. The ejected particles must leave the system\nwith velocities above the escape velocity. These particles will generally leave the system in a wide cone along\nthe axis of collision, however, for this discussion we just\nassume that they leave the system spherically.\nWhat happens with these sacrificed particles with positive total energy? Some will just leave the system radially, and be of no further concern for now, however,\nsome of them will happen to be directed towards the\nother large structure, C, and when they hit C they will\ntransfer their momentum to it through standard gravitational effects like dynamical friction. The effect on C is\ntherefore an effective pressure.\nWhen we compare the 2 configurations above, then\n\n\f2\nwe see that in both cases there will be a gravitational\nacceleration of C towards the combined system of A and\nB. However, in the second configuration there will be an\nadditional pressure on C. If we knew nothing about the\nmerger history of A and B, then we might interpret this\nextra acceleration of C as a negative gravitational effect.\nWe will refer to this as the \"rejected acceleration\".\nIf we were concerned with measuring the actual acceleration of the expansion of the universe, then it would\nbe important to consider the magnitude of the effect described above, and if the effect would be non-negligible,\nthen a careful subtraction must be done before we can ascribe the acceleration to e.g. a time varying cosmological\nconstant.\nIII.\n\nHOW LARGE IS THE EFFECT\n\nWe now wish to make a rough estimate of the effect.\nLet us consider the universe today, and let us assume that\nhalf of the total mass has been assembled into structures,\nall with the mass of a galaxy, M = 1012 M\u2299 . Naturally\none should consider the full mass distribution, N (M, z),\nhowever the argument below gives the same result for\nstructures of 109 M\u2299 and 1014 M\u2299 within a factor of a\nfew (largely from the difference in mass-concentration),\nso a proper integral over N (M, z) is expected to give the\nsame result within an order of magnitude.\nUsing a critical density of \u03c1c = 1.4 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 /Mpc3 ,\nthis means that the average distance between 2 structures\nis about 2.2 Mpc.\nWe wish to compare the rejected acceleration (that is,\nthe effective acceleration induced by the sacrificed particles) to the acceleration which is generally believed\nto originate from a cosmological constant. The cosmological constant induces an acceleration of the order\nGM\u039b (r)/r2 \u2248 9 \u00d7 10\u221214 m/s2 on a distance of r = 2.2\nMpc, where G is the gravitational constant, and M\u039b (r)\nis 0.7 \u03c1c integrated over a sphere of radius 2.2 Mpc. This\nsimple estimate is, within a factor of 2, the same as one\nobtains when numerically solving the Friedmann equation. We therefore have that the acceleration from a cosmological constant is given by\n2\n\na\u039b (2.2Mpc) \u2248 9 \u00d7 10\u221214 m/s .\n\n(1)\n\nNext we consider the acceleration from the sacrificed\nparticles. First it is important to remember that there\nis a time delay from the time when the particles were\nmerged onto (and ejected from) one galaxy, and till they\nwere absorbed by another galaxy. This retarded time depends on the typical distance between structures. If the\nejected particles from a galaxy has of the order 200 km/s\n(similar to the peak dispersion in the galaxy) then a distance of 2.2 Mpc implies that the particles were ejected\nroughly 1010 yrs ago. We therefore see that only the\nparticles ejected with at least 200 km/s (in addition to\nthe kinetic energy to leave the potential) will reach the\nother galaxy today. The ejected energy may easily be\n\neven higher or lower for some of the ejected particles.\nNumerical tests of the ejection mechanism seems to indicate that of the order 20\u221230% of the particles are ejected\nin a spherical cold collapse simulation [11], and between\n10% and 40% in merger simulations [12].\nLet us now discuss the rate at which the particles\nare ejected from the first galaxy. The merging rate has\nclearly not been a constant throughout the history of\nthe universe, however, to get the order of magnitude\nwe just simplify by a linear merging rate in time, such\nthat \u03b4M/\u03b4t = M/tH = 1012 M\u2299 /13.7 Gyr. We therefore use \u03b4M/\u03b4t = 108 M\u2299 /Myr. To fulfill the virial theorem, half the changed energy will be ejected or used\nto increase the size of the system. The distribution is\nmerger dependent, however, for this order of magnitude\nestimate, we simply consider a quarter of the energy to\nbe ejected which implies that roughly 0.25 \u03b4M/\u03b4t will be\nejected with v = 200 km/s. The acceleration is therefore\ndv/dt = v/M \u00d7 0.25 \u03b4M/\u03b4t \u2248 1.8 \u00d7 10\u221213 m/s2 .\nWe finally have to consider how many of the ejected\nparticles will deposit their momentum in another galaxy.\nIf we consider a very long timescale, then all particles\nwill eventually hit some galaxy. Equivalently, the one\nreceiving galaxy may absorb particles from a range of\npreviously merging structures. As a theoretical upper\nlimit we therefore have, that all the ejected particles may\nbe absorbed. However, many of these galaxies will lie\nat even larger distances, and the particles will therefore\ndeposit their energy far into the future. In that case\nthe velocities will be redshifted to lower values, and less\nenergy will be deposited. Typically, the velocity must\nbe redshifted below the escape velocity of the receiving\nstructure [12].\nWe therefore conclude that the rejected acceleration\nmust lie below the value found above\nareject(2.2Mpc) < 1.8 \u00d7 10\u221213 m/s2 .\n\nIV.\n\n(2)\n\nDISCUSSIONS\n\nWe have seen above that the rejected acceleration is\nsmaller than 1.8 \u00d7 10\u221213 m/s2 , which happens to be of\nthe same order of magnitude as the observed acceleration,\n2\na\u039b \u2248 9 \u00d7 10\u221214 m/s within a factor of a few.\nWe are here entertaining the view of the redshift being\na true Doppler shift, since we are ascribing the acceleration to a changed velocity of the galaxies and other cosmological structure. This is possibly completely equivalent to the view of the expansion being a stretching of\nspace [13]. This question is still actively debated (see a\nlist of references in [14]) and we will not enter that discussion here. Similarly, it is also actively debated how the\ndifferences in an inhomogenneous space between a local\naccelerating space and a globally accelerating space will\nmanifest themselves observationally (see e.g. [15, 16]).\nWe estimated above that the simplification from using\none mass only gives a order of magnitude uncertainty. In\n\n\f3\nprinciple this can be calculated more accurately, by using\nthe correct mass distribution, N (M, z), e.g. from PressSchechter theory. One complication that will arise is that\nparticles ejected from high mass structures are difficult\nto absorb by smaller structures due to the higher particle\nvelocities. In that sense there may be a larger effect of\nthe rejected acceleration on larger structures.\nThe merging rate is both mass and redshift dependent,\nand therefore the merging rate (and hence the rejected\nacceleration today) may be somewhat different than the\nestimate used above.\nAnother point which was ignored above is that the\nmass of the structures were smaller at the time when the\nparticles were ejected. For instance the 1012 M\u2299 structure\nconsidered above would only have about have 1/4 of that\nmass 1010 yrs ago. We have also been using that a quarter\nof the energy must be ejected, however, if the first galaxy\nchanges its size more than assumed during the merging,\nthen it may hold more energy, and fewer particles need\nto be ejected, and vice versa.\nA rather non-trivial point is the retarded time: the sacrificed particles will only be absorbed in other structures\nat a later time. This retardation will be different for different particles, depending on the mass of the structure\nthey are first merged onto. The reason is that whereas\nsmall mass structures are formed earlier (hence giving\na larger retarded time) then the sacrificed particles are\nejected at lower velocities. This all implies that there\nshould be a strong redshift dependence on the rejected\nacceleration. It is also interesting to note that the effect\nof rejected acceleration will diminish in the far future,\nwhen structure formation has been reduced for a long\ntime, and all ejected particles have either been absorbed\nor their energies redshifted away.\nTo a first approximation this effect should be isotropic,\nas the observed acceleration is. However, there may be\na slight anisotropic pressure near a large over-density\nwhere most of the merging happens along the filament.\nThis possibility can be quantified by numerical simulations, by observing to which degree the ejected particles\nare emitted spherically or along the axes of merging.\nOne might ask if this effect should already have been\nobserved by cosmological N-body simulations, and the\nanswer is no. Most simulations are executed by separating the expansion of the universe from the local effects of\nstructure formation. This means that the rejected acceleration cannot induce an extra acceleration of the expansion, but at best impose an extra radial pressure on all\nstructures in present day simulations. This radial pressure is low, and will be very difficult to disentangle from\nthe dynamics of the normally infalling particles. It is not\nknown to me if a method to perform cosmological simulations exists, where one can dynamically include the\neffect of the cosmological constant: if it will be possible\nto include for instance a local density dependent acceleration due to a generalized cosmological constant, then it\n\nwill certainly also be possible to include the effect of the\nrejected acceleration, at least in principle.\nFinally, a different point related to the retarded time is\nthe velocity with which the particles are ejected from the\noriginal structures. There will naturally be a broad distribution of velocities, since not all particles are ejected\nat the same velocity. One therefore has to fold this velocity distribution of the ejected particles with the mass\ndistribution, to find the full redshift dependence of this\nacceleration. One should also include the effect that different structures emit particles at different time, which\nmay lead to an accumulation of the effect. For instance a\n1010 M\u2299 structure will reject particles earlier and slower,\nthan a 2\u00d71010 M\u2299 structure. Therefore, there may be an\noverlap of the arriving particles today, from the particles\nejected at different times. Furthermore, above we merely\nused the proper distance today, however, in reality the\nrelevant distance will be slightly shorter because of the\nexpansion of the universe. Considering all these effects\nis a somewhat non-trivial calculation which we intend to\naddress in the near future.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe observed accelerated expansion of the universe is\ngenerally believed to be caused by a cosmological constant, or some time dependent generalization hereof. In\nthis brief note we point out a simply dynamical mechanism which may have a significant contribution to the\nacceleration.\nThe dynamical effect arises from merging of dark matter structures, where the virial theorem implies that a\nsignificant amount of kinetic energy must be carried away\nby ejected particles. These ejected particles will later deposit their momentum on other cosmological structures,\ninducing an effective accelerated expansion.\nWe estimate the effective accelerated expansion from\nthe ejected particles to be of the same order of magnitude as the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. The simple estimate presented here is accurate\nonly within a few orders of magnitude.\nWe emphasize that this dynamical effect is a well\nknown physical effect which cannot be avoided. It is\ntherefore something which needs to be calculated accurately and accounted for before measurements of a time\nvarying cosmological constant will be trustworthy.\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nIt is a pleasure to thank Jens Hjorth and Radek Wojtak\nfor discussions.
