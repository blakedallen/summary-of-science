Ground-based Interplanetary Scintillation (IPS) observations are an important\nand effective method for measuring solar wind speed and the structures of small diameter radio sources. We discuss one mode of ground-based single-station observations:\nSingle-Station Single-Frequency (SSSF) mode. To realize the SSSF mode, a new system\nhas been established at Urumqi Astronomical Observatory (UAO), China, and a series of\nexperimental observations were carried out successfully from May to December, 2008.\nKey words: IPS-SSSF-Observation\n1 INTRODUCTION\nRadiation from a distant compact radio source is scattered by the density irregularities in the solar wind\nplasma and produces a random diffraction pattern on the ground. The motion of these irregularities converts this pattern into temporal intensity fluctuations which are observed as interplanetary scintillation\n(IPS). IPS observations with ground-based telescopes can estimate the solar wind velocity and also the\nstructures of the distant compact radio sources (Hewish & Symonds 1969; Armstrong & Coles 1972).\nThis kind of measurement, though indirect, can give information on the solar wind out of the ecliptic\nplane and close to the Sun, where direct spacecraft measurements are not possible (e.g. Ma 1993). Here\nwe concentrate on extracting information on solar wind speed from IPS observations with ground-based\nsingle telescope.\nThere are two modes to observe the IPS phenomenon with a single-station: Single-Station SingleFrequency (SSSF) and Single-Station Dual-Frequency (SSDF). Since the discovery of the IPS phenomenon (Hewish et.al. 1964), many countries began doing IPS observations with the single-station\nmethod, i.e. Cambridge telescope in Britain (Pruvis et al. 1987), Ooty radio telescope in India (Swarup\net al. 1971), Puschino observatory in Russia (Vitkevich et al. 1976), one can use the power spectral\nfitting method to obtain the solar wind speed. With the multi-station method as used in Japan, which is a\nthree-station system (Kojima et al. 1995), one can measure the projected solar wind speed directly. China\nbegan IPS studies from the 1990s with the phased array mode of the Miyun Synthesis Radio Telescope\n(MSRT) at 232 MHz. Located at Miyun observatory (Wang 1990) in Beijing, it used the SSSF mode\n(Wu & Zhang 2001). Recently a new IPS observation system using the 50 m parabolic radio telescope,\n\n\f2\n\nLijia Liu, Xizhen Zhang,Jianbin Li, P.K. Manoharan, Zhiyong Liu & Bo Peng\n\nwhich is based on the SSDF mode at S/X and UHF bands, is under construction to serve the National\nMeridian Project of China.\nIn this paper, the theory of IPS, the technique, and the numerical simulation method of SSSF mode\nare introduced in section 2. The observations carried out at the UAO are reported in section 3. Finally\nconclusions are drawn in Section 4.\n2 THEORY\n2.1 The Theory of IPS\nInterplanetary scintillation is the name given to the intensity fluctuations of small diameter radio sources\nwhich are caused by density inhomogeneities in the solar wind. Figure 1 shows the geometry of IPS.The\ndistance between the Sun and Q is r, and r = sin(\u03b5)AU .\n\nFig. 1 IPS Geometry: z-axis is along the line-of-sight, x-axis is in the direction perpendicular\nto the z-axis pointing away from the Sun, and y-axis is normal to the paper. Q is the point\nclosest to the Sun along the line-of-sight, and \u03b5 is the elongation angle, Sun-Earth-source. r\nis the distance between the Sun and Q. Z is the distance between Q and the Earth.\nThe degree of scintillation is characterized by the scintillation index m (Cohen et al. 1967), which\nincreases with decreasing distance r until it reaches a maximum mmax at rmin . rmin changes with\nfrequency, rmin \u2248 0.2AU for meter wavelength (Manoharan, 1993).\nq\n2 \u2212 \u03c32\n\u03c3on\nof f\nm=\n(1)\nCon \u2212 Cof f\n2\n2\nwhere Con (Cof f ) is the average intensity of the on-source (off-source) signal, and \u03c3on\n(\u03c3of\nf ) is the\nsquare of rms of intensity scintillation. Here on-source case refers the telescope pointing at the radio\nsource, and off-source the telescope pointing at the background sky away from the source, being in the\nopposite pitching direction to where the radio source moves. IPS is strongest in the region nearest the\nSun, where we have the \"strong scintillation region\". In most of interplanetary space IPS is weak, which\nis called the \"weak scintillation region\" (Zhang 2006). In the weak scintillation region, m2 \u226a 1. The\nweak scintillation region is observed at r > rmin and strong scintillation is observed at r < rmin .\nPrevious studies show that the statistics of the scintillation are simply related to those of the turbulent\n\n\fObservation of Interplanetary Scintillation with Single-Station Mode at Urumqi\n\n3\n\ninterplanetary medium by a linear relationship, if the scintillation is weak (Coles & Harmon 1978). In\nthe \"strong scintillation region\", however, the relationship is not straight forward, and the present study\nalways deals with the weak scintillation case. The distance regime for the weak and strong regions\nrelates to observing frequencies. Table 1 shows the relationship between the frequency and distance\nregimes (Zhang 2006).\n\nTable 1 Regions of strong and weak scintillation at different frequencies. Taking 327 MHz for\nexample, the regimes for the strong and weak regions are within 35 solar radius and beyond\nrespectively.\n\nIn the weak scintillation region, where the radio wave can be treated as a plane-wave, and the Born\napproximation is applicable (e.g. Walker et al. 2004), the interplanetary medium can be considered to\nbe made up of many thin layers perpendicular to the line-of-sight. When the radio wave passes through\nthese layers, only the phase of the radio wave changes, while the amplitude of the radio wave stays\nthe same. This is called the \"thin screen approximation\", which is commonly used in the study of the\nionosphere, interplanetary medium, and interstellar medium.\n2.2 SSSF Mode\nSSSF refers to observing the IPS with a single station at a single frequency. There are two methods\nto obtain the solar wind speed from SSSF mode observed spectra: the spectral multi-parameter modelfitting, and the characteristic frequencies methods. The former can measure the speed by adjusting the\nmain parameters of the solar wind to fit the observed scintillation power spectra. The parameters are:\n\u03b1-power law index of the spatial spectrum of electron density, AR-axial ratio of solar wind irregularities,\nand V -solar wind speed. The latter can be determined by calculating two characteristic frequencies of\nthe spectra: the Fresnel knee frequency fF , and fmin the first minimum of the spectra. Then the solar\nwind speed can be calculated by either of the formulas shown below (Scott et al. 1983)\n\u221a\nV = fF Z\u03c0\u03bb\n\n(2)\n\n\u221a\nV = fmin Z\u03bb\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the observing wavelength, Z is the distance between Q and the Earth as shown in Fig. 1.\nAccording to weak scintillation theory and thin screen approximation theory, in the weak scintillation\nregion, the observed scintillation can be regarded as the sum of contributions from all the thin layers.\nFor a layer of thickness dZ, the distance from the layer to the Earth is Z, Vx (z) is the solar wind velocity\nprojected on to the plane perpendicular to the direction z, and the spectra observed at the Earth should\nbe (e.g. Scott et al. 1983; Ye & Qiu 1996):\n\nMs (f, Z)dZ =\n\n2\u03c0f (\u03bbre )2\nVx (z)\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03a6ne (kx , ky , kz = 0, Z) \u00d7 Fd Fs dky dZ\n\n(4)\n\n\f4\n\nLijia Liu, Xizhen Zhang,Jianbin Li, P.K. Manoharan, Zhiyong Liu & Bo Peng\n\nwhere,\n(kx2 + ky2 )\u03bbZ\n]\n4\u03c0\n\n(5)\n\nFs = exp[\u2212(kx2 + ky2 )Z 2 \u03b802 ]\n\n(6)\n\nFd = 4 sin2 [\n\nHere Fd and Fs are the Fresnel propagation filter parameter and the squared modulus of the radio\nsource visibility. We assume that the brightness of the radio source has a symmetrical-Gaussian distri2\n0)\nbution, i.e. B(\u03b8) = exp[ \u2212(\u03b8/\u03b8\n]. \u0398 is the full width at half maximum of the source, so we have the\n2\nangular diameter of the scintillating source \u03b80 = \u0398/2.35 (Manoharan & Ananthakrishnan 1990). \u03a6ne\nis the electron density power spectrum at distance z,\n\u03a6ne (kx , ky , kz = 0, Z) = T r\u22124 [kx2 + (ky /AR)2 ]\u2212\u03b1/2\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the amplitude of fluctuations in the electron density T is a constant. The spectrum obtained from\nthe Earth should be the sum of Eq. (4).\nZ \u221e\nMs (f, Z)dZ\n(8)\nMi (f ) =\n0\n\nOne can see that Mi (f ) depends on the solar wind parameters: axis ratio AR, power law index\n\u03b1, and the solar wind speed V . Previous studies show that, when other parameters fixed, AR mostly\naffects the low frequency part of the power spectra; when AR increases, the low frequency part becomes\nsteeper, but the high frequency part changes slightly. \u03b1 mostly affects the high frequency part of the\nspectra; when \u03b1 increases, the high frequency part attenuates quickly, but the low frequency part changes\ninevidently. The solar wind speed V mostly affects the Fresnel knee fF and the first minimum of the\nspectra fmin ; the two frequencies both become larger when V increases. Taking appropriate values to fit\nthe observed spectra, one can obtain the parameters of the observational data. Firstly one fits the fresnel\nknee according to fF and fmin , then fits the attenuated high part and the flat low frequency part. (Ye &\nQiu 1996)\nFig.2 is an example of the SSSF mode. Where the parameters taken are \u03bb = 92cm, \u03b1 = 3.5,\nAR = 2.0, V = 600km/s, \u03b80 = 0.02\u2032\u2032 . One can get fF = 1.05Hz, then from Eq.(2) we can obtain the\nsolar wind speed, which is 598.7 km/s, which fits to the simulated value well.\n3 OBSERVATIONS\n3.1 Instrument setup\nThe IPS experimental observations were performed from May to December 2008 with the 25 m radio\ntelescope at UAO, China, in SSSF mode. The UAO radio telescope is located to the south of Urumqi\ncity, with 87 deg longitude and 43 deg North latitude. Table 2 shows general information for the 25 m\nradio telescope receivers currently available at UAO.\nThe 6 cm and 18 cm bands have dual-polarization cooled receivers, while the 3.6 cm and 13 cm\nbands have single polarization cooled receivers. Table 3 summarizes some information on the IPS observations we carried out. Compact, strong radio sources selected for observation are listed in table\n4.\nTest observations were carried out at 49 cm, 18 cm, 13/3.6 cm and 6 cm. Each time the observation\nwas performed on-source for 10 minutes, and off-source for 5 minutes. The integration intervals tried\nwere 1 ms, 5 ms and 10 ms.\nAccording to the characteristics of the IPS phenomenon and synchrotron radiation of radio sources,\nit would be easier to detect IPS at lower observing frequencies. While the radio environment at UAO\n\n\fObservation of Interplanetary Scintillation with Single-Station Mode at Urumqi\n\n5\n\nFig. 2 Simulation result of SSSF mode, \u03bb = 92cm, \u03b1 = 3.5, AR = 2.0, V = 600km/s,\nfF = 1.05Hz\n\nTable 2 Information on the current receivers at UAO, where columns 1-4 give wavelength in\ncm, frequency range in MHz, system temperature in K, and noise injection in K.\n\nare not good at the 92 cm and 49 cm, so they are seldom used. Consequently we concluded that the 18\ncm band is the only window suitable for catching IPS at UAO.\nAfter a series of experiments, the 18 cm dual-polarization receiver at UAO was chosen for the\nobservations, and a data acquisition/receiving system was also established. The data sampling rate is\nadjustable with 8-bit quantification rate. Being a real-time display system, data quality can be monitored\nduring the observation, so parameters like gain or target source can be adjusted immediately. In order to\nminimize the RFI (radio frequency interference) influence in the observing window, a band-pass filter\nwas added to the output of IF (intermediate-frequency) of the 18 cm receiver. Figs.3 and 4 show a\ncharacteristic spectrum of the 18 cm receiver before and after the filter was added.\n\n\f6\n\nLijia Liu, Xizhen Zhang,Jianbin Li, P.K. Manoharan, Zhiyong Liu & Bo Peng\n\nTable 3 Key parameters of IPS observations with 25 m radio telescope performed in 2008\nat UAO, where columns 1-3 give observing wavelength in cm, observing date in mm/dd, and\nintegration interval in ms.\n\nTable 4 Details of the observed sources, where columns 1-4 give the source name, angular\ndiameter of the source in arc-second, the flux density at 1.4GHz in Jy and the distance from\nthe Sun in AU.\n\nThe entire bandwidth at UAO is 500MHz, with some interference in the band as shown in Fig.3.\nThe central frequency of the filter was set to 420MHz, and the 3dB bandwidth was 100MHz, with an\ninsertion loss of 3dB. It can be seen from Fig.4 that the filter works well, the interference in this band\nhas been effectively filtered out. The band selected was the part that with the lowest interference of the\nwhole band. The filter introduces some loss, so we added an amplifier before the radiometer but after\nthe filter.\nFig. 5 is a flowchart of the data acquisition instrument. There is a 0-40 dB step attenuator after the\nfrontend of the 18 cm receiver, with the attenuation step of 1 dB. A PCI8335 high-speed AD image\nacquisition card was added to our industrial computer, with an input voltage range 0-5V. The AD precision of this card is 16 Bit, with maximum of sampling rate of 250 kHz, and the buffer (FIFO: first in\nfirst out) is 8 Kbytes. The radio-meter has two channel outputs. The band of channel A is 5-500 MHz,\nand the band of channel B is 400-950 MHz. The input power for the two channels is the same: -20\ndBm to -60d Bm, and the output voltage range of the radiometer is 0-5 V. Channel A was used during\n\n\fObservation of Interplanetary Scintillation with Single-Station Mode at Urumqi\n\n7\n\nFig. 3 Characteristic spectrum of 18cm receiver at UAO before filtering\n\nFig. 4 Characteristic spectrum of 18 cm receiver at UAO after filtering\n\nour observation. Raw data, together with information on the target source like observing time, source\ncoordinates etc., are recorded by the data acquisition software.\nDuring the observations each time the on-source observations were 10 to 15 minutes, and the offsource observations were 5 minutes. In view of the different distances and orientations with respect to\nthe sun, we observed different sources at different times. The total observing time each day was about\n2-3 hrs.\n3.2 Data analysis\nIn order to eliminate the interference, besides the hardware method (adding a filter), a software solution\nhas also been developed.

This\ndata is assigned to DATA3.\nIn the filtering and re-sampling step, DATA3 is convolved with a rectangular window of suitable\nwidth corresponding to the re-sampling rate. The time series is then broken into blocks of length 8192\nsamples (for 1 ms data approximately 10 s long), and the mean value of each block is subtracted and\nthe block is then multiplied by a triangular weighting function, which is unity at the center and falls to\nzero at both ends. The result is then transformed by Fourier transformation (FT) to obtain the power\nspectrum.\n3.3 Observational results\nA series experimental IPS observations were made at UAO. Fig. 7 shows raw data obtained on Nov.\n27. The pointed source was 2MASX J18141308-1755351. Its flux density at 1.4 GHz is 5.39 Jy, and its\nprojected distance from sun was 0.23 AU.\n\n\fObservation of Interplanetary Scintillation with Single-Station Mode at Urumqi\n\n9\n\nFig. 6 Flowchart of data reduction for IPS observations\n\nFig. 7 Raw dataset display for 2MASX J18141308-1755351, observed on Nov.27, 2008. The\nx-axis is the number of points, the y-axis is the relative of voltage, each point taken with 0.25\nms sampling rate\n\nOne can see that the on-source part and off-source part are obviously identified. The fluctuation of\nthe two parts are almost the same, which indicates the IPS phenomenon at the time was weak, which\nis identical to the power spectrum in Fig. 8. It is clear that the Fresnel knee fF and the first minimum\nfrequency fmin are difficult to identify, indicating that there was little scintillation.\nFig. 9 shows a model-fit result of the data taken on Dec. 1, at a wavelength of 18 cm, with an\nintegration interval of 1 ms. The scintillation index is in the range 0.6 to 0.7 (There are some interference\nin the off source part). The model-fit method is the same as that of SSSF simulation. According to\nequation (4) to (8), the best parameters can be obtained by fitting with the observing spectra. The target\nsource was 3C345, with a flux density at 1.4 GHz of 7.1 Jy. The solid line shows the observed power\nspectrum, and the dashed line is the result of parametric model-fitting, with the fitting parameters: AR =\n1.2, \u03b1 = 3.1, V = 400km/s. According to OMNI data base, the solar wind speed the whole day ranged\nbetween 300 to 400 km/s, which is in agreement with the model-fitted value.\n4 CONCLUSIONS\nThe SSSF mode IPS observations have been studied by quite a number of pioneers (Manoharan et al.\n1994). Its instrument, data acquisition, and data reduction are simple. For this mode, high signal-to-\n\n\f10\n\nLijia Liu, Xizhen Zhang,Jianbin Li, P.K.

When AR increases, fF becomes\nambiguous, and fmin is easily affected by noise, AR and \u03b5. The fitting accuracy is affected by variations\nin the solar wind parameters, making it hard to calculate the solar wind speed accurately.\nCompared with the SSSF mode, the SSDF technique gives the solar wind speed via the first zero\npoint of the cross correlation spectrum, and fzero is most apparently affected by the velocity of the\nsolar wind rather than other parameters (i.e.Zhang 2007). It has the advantages of higher accuracy on\nthe measurement of solar wind speed and higher stability against the wide variations in solar wind\nparameters. But it introduces more complexity in the observing instrument and data taking system, it is\nnot used as widely as the SSSF mode.\nThe new system that is under construction at Miyun station near Beijing, China, with the 50 m\nradio telescope, adopted the SSDF mode to do the IPS observations. There are some lessons to be\nlearned from the observations with the UAO 25 m radio telescope, such as the integration time of the\n\n\fObservation of Interplanetary Scintillation with Single-Station Mode at Urumqi\n\n11\n\nreceiver system should be sufficiently short since the IPS phenomenon varies rapidly. This implies that\nthe effective receiving area of an IPS antenna should be large enough to ensure that the system has a\nhigh instantaneous sensitivity and its band-width should be well-matched to the system time resolution.\nA bandpass filter and low noise amplifiers (LNA) would be needed to reduce the system noise level.\n5 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors thank all the staff of Urumqi Astronomical Observatory, National Astronomical\nObservatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, especially Yi Aili, Yu Aili, N.

Ground-based Interplanetary Scintillation (IPS) observations are an important\nand effective method for measuring solar wind speed and the structures of small diameter radio sources. We discuss one mode of ground-based single-station observations:\nSingle-Station Single-Frequency (SSSF) mode. To realize the SSSF mode, a new system\nhas been established at Urumqi Astronomical Observatory (UAO), China, and a series of\nexperimental observations were carried out successfully from May to December, 2008.\nKey words: IPS-SSSF-Observation\n1 INTRODUCTION\nRadiation from a distant compact radio source is scattered by the density irregularities in the solar wind\nplasma and produces a random diffraction pattern on the ground. The motion of these irregularities converts this pattern into temporal intensity fluctuations which are observed as interplanetary scintillation\n(IPS). IPS observations with ground-based telescopes can estimate the solar wind velocity and also the\nstructures of the distant compact radio sources (Hewish & Symonds 1969; Armstrong & Coles 1972).\nThis kind of measurement, though indirect, can give information on the solar wind out of the ecliptic\nplane and close to the Sun, where direct spacecraft measurements are not possible (e.g. Ma 1993). Here\nwe concentrate on extracting information on solar wind speed from IPS observations with ground-based\nsingle telescope.\nThere are two modes to observe the IPS phenomenon with a single-station: Single-Station SingleFrequency (SSSF) and Single-Station Dual-Frequency (SSDF). Since the discovery of the IPS phenomenon (Hewish et.al. 1964), many countries began doing IPS observations with the single-station\nmethod, i.e. Cambridge telescope in Britain (Pruvis et al. 1987), Ooty radio telescope in India (Swarup\net al. 1971), Puschino observatory in Russia (Vitkevich et al. 1976), one can use the power spectral\nfitting method to obtain the solar wind speed. With the multi-station method as used in Japan, which is a\nthree-station system (Kojima et al. 1995), one can measure the projected solar wind speed directly. China\nbegan IPS studies from the 1990s with the phased array mode of the Miyun Synthesis Radio Telescope\n(MSRT) at 232 MHz. Located at Miyun observatory (Wang 1990) in Beijing, it used the SSSF mode\n(Wu & Zhang 2001). Recently a new IPS observation system using the 50 m parabolic radio telescope,\n\n\f2\n\nLijia Liu, Xizhen Zhang,Jianbin Li, P.K. Manoharan, Zhiyong Liu & Bo Peng\n\nwhich is based on the SSDF mode at S/X and UHF bands, is under construction to serve the National\nMeridian Project of China.\nIn this paper, the theory of IPS, the technique, and the numerical simulation method of SSSF mode\nare introduced in section 2. The observations carried out at the UAO are reported in section 3. Finally\nconclusions are drawn in Section 4.\n2 THEORY\n2.1 The Theory of IPS\nInterplanetary scintillation is the name given to the intensity fluctuations of small diameter radio sources\nwhich are caused by density inhomogeneities in the solar wind. Figure 1 shows the geometry of IPS.The\ndistance between the Sun and Q is r, and r = sin(\u03b5)AU .\n\nFig. 1 IPS Geometry: z-axis is along the line-of-sight, x-axis is in the direction perpendicular\nto the z-axis pointing away from the Sun, and y-axis is normal to the paper. Q is the point\nclosest to the Sun along the line-of-sight, and \u03b5 is the elongation angle, Sun-Earth-source. r\nis the distance between the Sun and Q. Z is the distance between Q and the Earth.\nThe degree of scintillation is characterized by the scintillation index m (Cohen et al. 1967), which\nincreases with decreasing distance r until it reaches a maximum mmax at rmin . rmin changes with\nfrequency, rmin \u2248 0.2AU for meter wavelength (Manoharan, 1993).\nq\n2 \u2212 \u03c32\n\u03c3on\nof f\nm=\n(1)\nCon \u2212 Cof f\n2\n2\nwhere Con (Cof f ) is the average intensity of the on-source (off-source) signal, and \u03c3on\n(\u03c3of\nf ) is the\nsquare of rms of intensity scintillation. Here on-source case refers the telescope pointing at the radio\nsource, and off-source the telescope pointing at the background sky away from the source, being in the\nopposite pitching direction to where the radio source moves. IPS is strongest in the region nearest the\nSun, where we have the \"strong scintillation region\". In most of interplanetary space IPS is weak, which\nis called the \"weak scintillation region\" (Zhang 2006). In the weak scintillation region, m2 \u226a 1. The\nweak scintillation region is observed at r > rmin and strong scintillation is observed at r < rmin .\nPrevious studies show that the statistics of the scintillation are simply related to those of the turbulent\n\n\fObservation of Interplanetary Scintillation with Single-Station Mode at Urumqi\n\n3\n\ninterplanetary medium by a linear relationship, if the scintillation is weak (Coles & Harmon 1978). In\nthe \"strong scintillation region\", however, the relationship is not straight forward, and the present study\nalways deals with the weak scintillation case. The distance regime for the weak and strong regions\nrelates to observing frequencies. Table 1 shows the relationship between the frequency and distance\nregimes (Zhang 2006).\n\nTable 1 Regions of strong and weak scintillation at different frequencies. Taking 327 MHz for\nexample, the regimes for the strong and weak regions are within 35 solar radius and beyond\nrespectively.\n\nIn the weak scintillation region, where the radio wave can be treated as a plane-wave, and the Born\napproximation is applicable (e.g. Walker et al. 2004), the interplanetary medium can be considered to\nbe made up of many thin layers perpendicular to the line-of-sight. When the radio wave passes through\nthese layers, only the phase of the radio wave changes, while the amplitude of the radio wave stays\nthe same. This is called the \"thin screen approximation\", which is commonly used in the study of the\nionosphere, interplanetary medium, and interstellar medium.\n2.2 SSSF Mode\nSSSF refers to observing the IPS with a single station at a single frequency. There are two methods\nto obtain the solar wind speed from SSSF mode observed spectra: the spectral multi-parameter modelfitting, and the characteristic frequencies methods. The former can measure the speed by adjusting the\nmain parameters of the solar wind to fit the observed scintillation power spectra. The parameters are:\n\u03b1-power law index of the spatial spectrum of electron density, AR-axial ratio of solar wind irregularities,\nand V -solar wind speed. The latter can be determined by calculating two characteristic frequencies of\nthe spectra: the Fresnel knee frequency fF , and fmin the first minimum of the spectra. Then the solar\nwind speed can be calculated by either of the formulas shown below (Scott et al. 1983)\n\u221a\nV = fF Z\u03c0\u03bb\n\n(2)\n\n\u221a\nV = fmin Z\u03bb\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the observing wavelength, Z is the distance between Q and the Earth as shown in Fig. 1.\nAccording to weak scintillation theory and thin screen approximation theory, in the weak scintillation\nregion, the observed scintillation can be regarded as the sum of contributions from all the thin layers.\nFor a layer of thickness dZ, the distance from the layer to the Earth is Z, Vx (z) is the solar wind velocity\nprojected on to the plane perpendicular to the direction z, and the spectra observed at the Earth should\nbe (e.g. Scott et al. 1983; Ye & Qiu 1996):\n\nMs (f, Z)dZ =\n\n2\u03c0f (\u03bbre )2\nVx (z)\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03a6ne (kx , ky , kz = 0, Z) \u00d7 Fd Fs dky dZ\n\n(4)\n\n\f4\n\nLijia Liu, Xizhen Zhang,Jianbin Li, P.K. Manoharan, Zhiyong Liu & Bo Peng\n\nwhere,\n(kx2 + ky2 )\u03bbZ\n]\n4\u03c0\n\n(5)\n\nFs = exp[\u2212(kx2 + ky2 )Z 2 \u03b802 ]\n\n(6)\n\nFd = 4 sin2 [\n\nHere Fd and Fs are the Fresnel propagation filter parameter and the squared modulus of the radio\nsource visibility. We assume that the brightness of the radio source has a symmetrical-Gaussian distri2\n0)\nbution, i.e. B(\u03b8) = exp[ \u2212(\u03b8/\u03b8\n]. \u0398 is the full width at half maximum of the source, so we have the\n2\nangular diameter of the scintillating source \u03b80 = \u0398/2.35 (Manoharan & Ananthakrishnan 1990). \u03a6ne\nis the electron density power spectrum at distance z,\n\u03a6ne (kx , ky , kz = 0, Z) = T r\u22124 [kx2 + (ky /AR)2 ]\u2212\u03b1/2\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the amplitude of fluctuations in the electron density T is a constant. The spectrum obtained from\nthe Earth should be the sum of Eq. (4).\nZ \u221e\nMs (f, Z)dZ\n(8)\nMi (f ) =\n0\n\nOne can see that Mi (f ) depends on the solar wind parameters: axis ratio AR, power law index\n\u03b1, and the solar wind speed V . Previous studies show that, when other parameters fixed, AR mostly\naffects the low frequency part of the power spectra; when AR increases, the low frequency part becomes\nsteeper, but the high frequency part changes slightly. \u03b1 mostly affects the high frequency part of the\nspectra; when \u03b1 increases, the high frequency part attenuates quickly, but the low frequency part changes\ninevidently. The solar wind speed V mostly affects the Fresnel knee fF and the first minimum of the\nspectra fmin ; the two frequencies both become larger when V increases. Taking appropriate values to fit\nthe observed spectra, one can obtain the parameters of the observational data. Firstly one fits the fresnel\nknee according to fF and fmin , then fits the attenuated high part and the flat low frequency part. (Ye &\nQiu 1996)\nFig.2 is an example of the SSSF mode. Where the parameters taken are \u03bb = 92cm, \u03b1 = 3.5,\nAR = 2.0, V = 600km/s, \u03b80 = 0.02\u2032\u2032 . One can get fF = 1.05Hz, then from Eq.(2) we can obtain the\nsolar wind speed, which is 598.7 km/s, which fits to the simulated value well.\n3 OBSERVATIONS\n3.1 Instrument setup\nThe IPS experimental observations were performed from May to December 2008 with the 25 m radio\ntelescope at UAO, China, in SSSF mode. The UAO radio telescope is located to the south of Urumqi\ncity, with 87 deg longitude and 43 deg North latitude. Table 2 shows general information for the 25 m\nradio telescope receivers currently available at UAO.\nThe 6 cm and 18 cm bands have dual-polarization cooled receivers, while the 3.6 cm and 13 cm\nbands have single polarization cooled receivers. Table 3 summarizes some information on the IPS observations we carried out. Compact, strong radio sources selected for observation are listed in table\n4.\nTest observations were carried out at 49 cm, 18 cm, 13/3.6 cm and 6 cm. Each time the observation\nwas performed on-source for 10 minutes, and off-source for 5 minutes. The integration intervals tried\nwere 1 ms, 5 ms and 10 ms.\nAccording to the characteristics of the IPS phenomenon and synchrotron radiation of radio sources,\nit would be easier to detect IPS at lower observing frequencies. While the radio environment at UAO\n\n\fObservation of Interplanetary Scintillation with Single-Station Mode at Urumqi\n\n5\n\nFig. 2 Simulation result of SSSF mode, \u03bb = 92cm, \u03b1 = 3.5, AR = 2.0, V = 600km/s,\nfF = 1.05Hz\n\nTable 2 Information on the current receivers at UAO, where columns 1-4 give wavelength in\ncm, frequency range in MHz, system temperature in K, and noise injection in K.\n\nare not good at the 92 cm and 49 cm, so they are seldom used. Consequently we concluded that the 18\ncm band is the only window suitable for catching IPS at UAO.\nAfter a series of experiments, the 18 cm dual-polarization receiver at UAO was chosen for the\nobservations, and a data acquisition/receiving system was also established. The data sampling rate is\nadjustable with 8-bit quantification rate. Being a real-time display system, data quality can be monitored\nduring the observation, so parameters like gain or target source can be adjusted immediately. In order to\nminimize the RFI (radio frequency interference) influence in the observing window, a band-pass filter\nwas added to the output of IF (intermediate-frequency) of the 18 cm receiver. Figs.3 and 4 show a\ncharacteristic spectrum of the 18 cm receiver before and after the filter was added.\n\n\f6\n\nLijia Liu, Xizhen Zhang,Jianbin Li, P.K. Manoharan, Zhiyong Liu & Bo Peng\n\nTable 3 Key parameters of IPS observations with 25 m radio telescope performed in 2008\nat UAO, where columns 1-3 give observing wavelength in cm, observing date in mm/dd, and\nintegration interval in ms.\n\nTable 4 Details of the observed sources, where columns 1-4 give the source name, angular\ndiameter of the source in arc-second, the flux density at 1.4GHz in Jy and the distance from\nthe Sun in AU.\n\nThe entire bandwidth at UAO is 500MHz, with some interference in the band as shown in Fig.3.\nThe central frequency of the filter was set to 420MHz, and the 3dB bandwidth was 100MHz, with an\ninsertion loss of 3dB. It can be seen from Fig.4 that the filter works well, the interference in this band\nhas been effectively filtered out. The band selected was the part that with the lowest interference of the\nwhole band. The filter introduces some loss, so we added an amplifier before the radiometer but after\nthe filter.\nFig. 5 is a flowchart of the data acquisition instrument. There is a 0-40 dB step attenuator after the\nfrontend of the 18 cm receiver, with the attenuation step of 1 dB. A PCI8335 high-speed AD image\nacquisition card was added to our industrial computer, with an input voltage range 0-5V. The AD precision of this card is 16 Bit, with maximum of sampling rate of 250 kHz, and the buffer (FIFO: first in\nfirst out) is 8 Kbytes. The radio-meter has two channel outputs. The band of channel A is 5-500 MHz,\nand the band of channel B is 400-950 MHz. The input power for the two channels is the same: -20\ndBm to -60d Bm, and the output voltage range of the radiometer is 0-5 V. Channel A was used during\n\n\fObservation of Interplanetary Scintillation with Single-Station Mode at Urumqi\n\n7\n\nFig. 3 Characteristic spectrum of 18cm receiver at UAO before filtering\n\nFig. 4 Characteristic spectrum of 18 cm receiver at UAO after filtering\n\nour observation. Raw data, together with information on the target source like observing time, source\ncoordinates etc., are recorded by the data acquisition software.\nDuring the observations each time the on-source observations were 10 to 15 minutes, and the offsource observations were 5 minutes. In view of the different distances and orientations with respect to\nthe sun, we observed different sources at different times. The total observing time each day was about\n2-3 hrs.\n3.2 Data analysis\nIn order to eliminate the interference, besides the hardware method (adding a filter), a software solution\nhas also been developed. Figure 6 is the flowchart of the data analysis. First, the raw data observed\nare played back on the screen to identify the parts with lower noise and one subtracts the noise using\nsoftware, i.e. the slowly changing component is subtracted from the raw data, and assigned to DATA1.\nDATA1 is then compared with 3 times the rms error of a long span of data to eliminate wild points.\nPoints with absolute values higher than the 3 rms are omitted and replaced by the average value of\nthe preceding and following data points, then this data is assigned to DATA2.

This\ndata is assigned to DATA3.\nIn the filtering and re-sampling step, DATA3 is convolved with a rectangular window of suitable\nwidth corresponding to the re-sampling rate. The time series is then broken into blocks of length 8192\nsamples (for 1 ms data approximately 10 s long), and the mean value of each block is subtracted and\nthe block is then multiplied by a triangular weighting function, which is unity at the center and falls to\nzero at both ends. The result is then transformed by Fourier transformation (FT) to obtain the power\nspectrum.\n3.3 Observational results\nA series experimental IPS observations were made at UAO. Fig. 7 shows raw data obtained on Nov.\n27. The pointed source was 2MASX J18141308-1755351. Its flux density at 1.4 GHz is 5.39 Jy, and its\nprojected distance from sun was 0.23 AU.\n\n\fObservation of Interplanetary Scintillation with Single-Station Mode at Urumqi\n\n9\n\nFig. 6 Flowchart of data reduction for IPS observations\n\nFig. 7 Raw dataset display for 2MASX J18141308-1755351, observed on Nov.27, 2008. The\nx-axis is the number of points, the y-axis is the relative of voltage, each point taken with 0.25\nms sampling rate\n\nOne can see that the on-source part and off-source part are obviously identified. The fluctuation of\nthe two parts are almost the same, which indicates the IPS phenomenon at the time was weak, which\nis identical to the power spectrum in Fig. 8. It is clear that the Fresnel knee fF and the first minimum\nfrequency fmin are difficult to identify, indicating that there was little scintillation.\nFig. 9 shows a model-fit result of the data taken on Dec. 1, at a wavelength of 18 cm, with an\nintegration interval of 1 ms. The scintillation index is in the range 0.6 to 0.7 (There are some interference\nin the off source part). The model-fit method is the same as that of SSSF simulation. According to\nequation (4) to (8), the best parameters can be obtained by fitting with the observing spectra. The target\nsource was 3C345, with a flux density at 1.4 GHz of 7.1 Jy. The solid line shows the observed power\nspectrum, and the dashed line is the result of parametric model-fitting, with the fitting parameters: AR =\n1.2, \u03b1 = 3.1, V = 400km/s. According to OMNI data base, the solar wind speed the whole day ranged\nbetween 300 to 400 km/s, which is in agreement with the model-fitted value.\n4 CONCLUSIONS\nThe SSSF mode IPS observations have been studied by quite a number of pioneers (Manoharan et al.\n1994). Its instrument, data acquisition, and data reduction are simple. For this mode, high signal-to-\n\n\f10\n\nLijia Liu, Xizhen Zhang,Jianbin Li, P.K.

When AR increases, fF becomes\nambiguous, and fmin is easily affected by noise, AR and \u03b5. The fitting accuracy is affected by variations\nin the solar wind parameters, making it hard to calculate the solar wind speed accurately.\nCompared with the SSSF mode, the SSDF technique gives the solar wind speed via the first zero\npoint of the cross correlation spectrum, and fzero is most apparently affected by the velocity of the\nsolar wind rather than other parameters (i.e.Zhang 2007). It has the advantages of higher accuracy on\nthe measurement of solar wind speed and higher stability against the wide variations in solar wind\nparameters. But it introduces more complexity in the observing instrument and data taking system, it is\nnot used as widely as the SSSF mode.\nThe new system that is under construction at Miyun station near Beijing, China, with the 50 m\nradio telescope, adopted the SSDF mode to do the IPS observations. There are some lessons to be\nlearned from the observations with the UAO 25 m radio telescope, such as the integration time of the\n\n\fObservation of Interplanetary Scintillation with Single-Station Mode at Urumqi\n\n11\n\nreceiver system should be sufficiently short since the IPS phenomenon varies rapidly. This implies that\nthe effective receiving area of an IPS antenna should be large enough to ensure that the system has a\nhigh instantaneous sensitivity and its band-width should be well-matched to the system time resolution.\nA bandpass filter and low noise amplifiers (LNA) would be needed to reduce the system noise level.\n5 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors thank all the staff of Urumqi Astronomical Observatory, National Astronomical\nObservatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, especially Yi Aili, Yu Aili, N.
