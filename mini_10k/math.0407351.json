Our aim is to present a solution of the Problem 31 of Chapter 8\nof [5] by presenting a general theorem on hyper-quasi-identities considered\nas hyperbasis for solid quasi-varieties. In the last section we point out also\na generalization of that result for the notion of M-hyper-quasi-identities.\nThe results were presented at AAA68 Conference at Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, June 13, 2004.\n\n1. Notations\nAn identity is a pair of terms where the variables are bound by universal\nquantifiers. Let us take the following medial identity as an example\n\u2200u\u2200x\u2200y\u2200w (u * x) * (y * w) = (u * y) * (x * w).\nLet us look at the following hyperidentity\n\u2200f \u2200u\u2200x\u2200y\u2200w f (f (u, v), f (x, y)) = f (f (u, x), f (v, y)).\nThe hypervariable f is considered in a very specific way. Firstly every hypervariable is restricted to functional symbols of a given arity. Secondly, for a\nhypervariable only functions of a given arity have to be substituted, and these\nfunctions have to be term functions. Let us take the variety An,0 of abelian\ngroups of finite exponent n. Every binary term t \u2261 t(x, y) can be presented by\nt(x, y) = ax + by with a, b \u2208 N0 . If we substitute the binary hypervariable F\nin the above hyperidentity by ax + by, leaving its variables unchanged, we get\na(au + bv) + b(ax + by) = a(au + bx) + b(av + by).\nThis identity holds for every term t(x, y) = ax + by for the variety An,0 .\nTherefore we say that the hyperidentity holds for the variety An,0 .\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Hyper-quasi-identities\nIn the sequel we avoid to use the definition of hyperterm from [10] and\naccept the convention that a hyperterm is formally the same as a term. We\naccept the notation of [2], [13], [7].\nHypersubstitutions of terms were defined in [4], [5] and [10]. Shortly speaking, they are mappings sending terms to terms by substituting variables by\n(the same) variables and functional symbols by terms of the same arities, i.e.\n\u03c3(x) = x for any variable x, and for given functional symbol f , assume that\n\u03c3(f ) is a given term of the same arity as f , then \u03c3 acts on all terms of a given\ntype in an inductive way: \u03c3(f (p1 , ..., pn )) = \u03c3(f )(\u03c3(p1 ), ..., \u03c3(pn )).\n\u03a3(\u03c4 ) denotes the set of all hypersubstitutions \u03c3 of a given type \u03c4 .\nWe recall only our definitions of [10] of hyperidentities satisfied in an algebra\nof a given type and the notion of a hypervariety:\nDefinition 2.1. An algebra A satisfies a hyperidentity h1 = h2 if for every\nsubstitution of the hypervariables by terms (of the same arity) of A leaving\nthe variables unchanged, the identities which arise hold in A. In this case, we\nwrite A |= (h1 = h2 ). A variety V satisfies a hyperidentity h1 = h2 if every\nalgebra in the variety does.\nDefinition 2.2. A class V of a algebras of a given type is called a hypervariety\nif and only if V is defined by a set of hyperidentities.\nRemark 1. Some authors avoid to use our concepts since in [18] W. Taylor\ndefined hypervarieties to be classes of varieties of different types satisfying\ncertain sets of equations as identities (see also [15]).\nThe following was proved in [10]:\nTheorem 2.3. A variety V of type \u03c4 is defined by a set of hyperidentities if\nand only if V = HSP D(V ), i.e. V is a variety closed under derived algebras\nof type \u03c4 .\nWe recall from [14] and [7]:\nDefinition 2.4. A quasi-identity e is an implication of the form:\n(1.1) (t0 = s0 ) \u2227 ... \u2227 (tn\u22121 = sn\u22121 ) \u2192 (tn = sn ).\nwhere ti = si are k-ary identities of a given type, for i = 0, ..., n.\nA quasi-identity above is satisfied in an algebra A of a given type if and only\nif the following implication is satisfied in A: given a sequence a1 , ..., ak of elements of A. If these elements satisfy the equations ti (a1 , ..., ak ) = si (a1 , ..., an )\nin A, for i = 0, 1, ..., n \u2212 1, then the equality tn (a1 , ..., ak ) = sn (a1 , ..., ak ) is\nsatisfied in A. In that case we write:\n\n\fON THE PROBLEM OF BASIS FOR HYPERQUASIVARIETIES\n\n3\n\nA |= (t0 = s0 ) \u2227 ... \u2227 (tn\u22121 = sn\u22121 ) \u2192 (tn = sn ).\nA quasi-identity e is satisfied in a class V of algebras of a given type, if and\nonly if it is satisfied in all algebras A belonging to V .\nFollowing A. I. Mal'cev [14] we consider classes QV of algebras A of a given\ntype \u03c4 defined by quasi-identities and call them quasivarieties.\nFormally (cf. [5], [10]), a hyper-quasi-identity e is the same as quasi-identity.\nFollowing the ideas of [16], part 5, cf. [5] and [11] (cf. [3]) we modify the\ndefinition above in the following way.\nDefinition 2.5. A hyper-quasi-identity e is satisfied (is hyper-satisfied, holds)\nin an algebra A if and only if the following implication is satisfied:\nif \u03c3 is a hypersubstitution of type \u03c4 and the elements a1 , ..., an \u2208 A satisfy the\nequalities \u03c3(ti )(a1 , ..., ak ) = \u03c3(si )(a1 , ..., ak ) in A, for n = 0, 1, ..., n \u2212 1, then\nthe equality \u03c3(tn )(a1 , ..., ak ) = \u03c3(sn )(a1 , ..., ak ) holds in A.\nIn that case, we write V |=H e.\nIn other words, hyper-quasi-identity is a universally closed Horn \u2200x\u2200\u03c3formulas, where x varies over all sequences of individual variables (occurring\nin terms of the implication) and \u03c3 varies over all hypersubstitutions of a given\ntype. Our modification coincides with Definition 5.1.3 of [16] (cf. Definition\n2.3 of [3]).\nRemark 2. All hyper-quasi-identities and hyperidentities are written without quantifiers but they are considered as universally closed Horn \u2200-formulas\n(cf. [14]). A syntactic side of the notions described here is considered in a\nforthcoming paper, together with a suitable generalization of the notion of\nhyperquasivariety to M-hyperquasivariety.\nLet V be a class of algebras of type \u03c4 . Derived algebras were defined in [2].\nDerived algebras of a given type \u03c4 were defined in [16], [10].\nDefinition 2.6. Let A = (A, F ) be an algebra in V and \u03c3 a hypersubstitution\nin \u03a3(\u03c4 ). Then the algebra B = (A, (F )\u03c3 ) is a derived algebra of A, with the\nsame universe A and the set (F )\u03c3 of all derived operations of F . We denote\nthen B as A\u03c3 .\n3. Problem Formulation\nIn the Example on p. 155 of [5] the authors proved that the quasi-identities\nof the given basis of [5] are hyper-quasi-identities. In the Problem 31 of Chapter 8 they posed the question:\n(3.1) Prove that it is sufficient to prove that the quasi-identities of the given\nbasis of Example on p. 155 of [5] are hyper-quasi-identities for checking that\nevery quasi-identity is a hyperquasi-identity.\n\n\f4\n\nE.,W.,GRACZY\u0143SKA\n\nWe shall refer to the question above as to the Problem (3.1).\nIn [5] solid quasivarieties were defined as quasivarieties closed under taking\nof derived algebras, i.e. we assume the following\nDefinition 3.1. Let QV be a quasivariety, then QV is solid if and only if\nevery derived algebra A\u03c3 belongs to QV , for every algebra A in QV and \u03c3 in\n\u03a3(\u03c4 ).\nWe write then, that\nQV = D(QV )\nIn [11] solid quasivarieties in the above sense were called hyperquasivarieties.\n3.1. Basis and hyperbasis. Let \u03a3 be a set of quasi-identities of type \u03c4 .\nDefinition 3.2. A quasivariety QV of all algebras of type \u03c4 satisfying all\nquasi-identities of \u03a3 is called a quasivariety defined by the basis \u03a3.\nDefinition 3.3. A quasivariety QV of all algebras of type \u03c4 satisfying all\nquasi-identities of \u03a3 as hyperquasi-identities is called a quasivariety defined by\nthe hyperbasis \u03a3.\nRecall Example of [5], p. 155:\nExample. Consider the quasivariety QV of type \u03c4 = (2) defined by the\nfollowing identities:\n(S1) x(yz) = (xy)z, (identities are regarded as quasi-identities),\n(S2) xx = x,\n(S3) (xy)(uv) = (xu)(yv),\n(S4) (xy = yx) \u2192 (x = y).\nThe example above shows, that the given basis (S1)-(S4) is also a hyperbasis\nof QV .\nThe authors of [5] proved that the identities (S1), (S2), (S3) are satisfied\nas hyperidentities and thus as hyperquasi-identities in QV . Moreover (S4) is\nsatisfied as a hyperquasi-identity. Finally they concluded that the quasivariety\nQV is solid.\nLet us note, that in the proof in [5] on p. 155 of the fact above, the authors\ndid not use their own definition on p. 155 of a solid qusivariety. Therefore\nwe present here an explicit proof of the positive solution of the Problem 3.1\nto make the situation more clear for the reader. Namely, our main theorem\nstates that every quasivariety defined by a hyperbasis is solid and vice versa.\n\n\fON THE PROBLEM OF BASIS FOR HYPERQUASIVARIETIES\n\n5\n\nRemark 3. The positive answer of the Problem 3.1 can also be concluded\nvia Theorem 2.6 of [3], even for the case of M-hyperquasi-equational theories.\nFor varieties the solution can be also proved via Theorems 13.3 - 13.5 of [9] or\nTheorem 14.34 of [6]. In a more general setting, the solution is also implicitly\ncontained in [6], Theorem 13.1.6 and Theorem 13.1.5 as a part of the theory of\nconjugate pairs of additive closure operators (cf. Lemma 4.9.2 and Theorem\n4.9.3 of [5], p. 156). However, in the paper we do not use this theory, neither\nthe authors of [3] and [6] wrote an explicit proof of the problem.\nIn addition, our Propositions 5.2 and 5.4 show that the Problem 3.1 considered here is mainly connected with relations between rules of inferences and\nnot directly with the quoted above results of [3] and [5], [6].\n4. Problem Solution\nWe present here a short proof of of the required statement by proving the\nfollowing:\nMain Theorem 4.1. Let QV be a quasivariety defined by a set \u03a3 of quasiidentities. These quasi-identities are satisfied in QV as hyper-quasi-identities\nif and only if QV is solid (is a hyperquasivariety). Moreover, each quasiidentity satisfied in a solid quasivariety QV is satisfied in QV as a hyperquasi-identity and vice versa.\nProof. Let be given a quasivariety QV with a basis \u03a3 of quasi-identities. Assume that all quasi-identities of \u03a3 are satisfied in QV as hyper-quasi-identities\n(i.e. \u03a3 is a hyperbasis of QV ). Let A be an algebra in QV and a derived algebra B = A\u03c3 . Then for any quasi-identity e of \u03a3, this quasi-identity e is\nsatisfied in B, for the following reason: each term t of type \u03c4 is realized in\nB as \u03c3(t), therefore for a given sequence a1 , ..., ak of elements of A, if these\nelements satisfy the equations ti (a1 , ..., ak ) = si (a1 , ..., ak ) for i = 1, ..., n \u2212 1,\nin B (i.e. equations \u03c3(ti )(a1 , ..., ak ) = \u03c3(si )(a1 , ..., ak ) for i = 1, ..., n \u2212 1 in A)\nthen the equality tn (a1 , ..., ak ) = sn (a1 , ..., ak ) is satisfied in B (i.e. the equality \u03c3(tn )(a1 , ..., ak ) = \u03c3(sn )(a1 , ..., ak ) is satisfied in A) from the assumption\nthat \u03a3 is a hyperbasis of QV . Therefore B is in QV and QV is solid.\nLet QV be a solid quasivariety defined by a basis \u03a3. Then any quasi-identity\ne of \u03a3 is satisfied in QV as a hyper-quasi-identity (i.e. \u03a3 is a hyperbasis of\nQV ). To show this take a \u03c3 of \u03a3(\u03c4 ) and any algebra A of QV . Assume\nthat for a given sequence a1 , ..., ak of elements of A, these elements satisfy\nthe equations \u03c3(ti )(a1 , ..., ak ) = \u03c3(si )(a1 , ..., ak ) for i = 1, ..., n \u2212 1, then the\nequality \u03c3(tn )(a1 , ..., ak ) = \u03c3(sn )(a1 , ..., ak ) is satisfied in the derived algebra\nB = A\u03c3 , by similar arguments as above, as B is in QV by the assumption\nthat QV is solid and e is satisfied in QV as an element of \u03a3.\n\n\f6\n\nE.,W.,GRACZY\u0143SKA\n\nTherefore we have proved that a quasivariety QV defined by a basis \u03a3 is\nsolid if and only if \u03a3 is its hyperbasis. Let us note, that every quasivariety\nQV is defined by a basis \u03a3 consisting of all quasi-identities satisfied in QV .\nThis observation proves the last statement of our main theorem.\n\u0003\n5. Varieties\nAs a specific case of quasivarieties one may consider varieties of algebras\nand conclude a similar theorem for basis and hyperbasis of identities (cf. [10]):\nProposition 5.1. Let V be a variety defined by a set \u03a3 of identities. These\nidentities are satisfied in V as hyper-identities if and only if V is solid. Moreover, each identity satisfied in a solid variety V is satisfied in V as a hyperidentity, i.e. V is a hypervariety and vice versa. Therefore the both notion\ncoincide.\nProof. The proof follows immediately from the Birkhoff's type theorem proved\nin [10]: a variety V is solid if and only if\nV = HSP D(V ).\n\u0003\nLet us denote by E, the closure operator defined by the classical rules\n(1)-(5) of inferences for identities (cf. [1], [13]) and E H denotes the closure\noperator defined by the rules (1) - (5) and so called hypersubstitution rule (6)\nof [10], p. 308. In [8] we proved the following Lemma 2, p. 121 (cf. Remark\n1.2 of [10] p. 308):\nProposition 5.2. If \u03a3 is a set of identities of type \u03c4 , closed under hypersubstitution rule (6), then E(\u03a3) = E H (\u03a3).\nLet us note that the Proposition 5.2 can be slightly generalized by considering the rule (6)M , i.e. the M-hypersubstitution rule of [9], p. 90, instead of\nthe rule (6) (i.e. by considering only hypersubstitutions from a given monoid\nH denotes the closure\nM instead all hypersubstitutions of a given type). Let EM\noperator defined by the inference rules (1) - (5) of G. Birkhoff and the rule\n(6)M . First recall from [9], p. 90:\nDefinition 5.3. Let be given a monoid M of hypersubstitions of type \u03c4 . The\nM-hypersubstition rule is defined by the following:\n(6)M from p = q conclude \u03c3(p) = \u03c3(q), for every \u03c3 \u2208 M .\nWe get:\n\n\fON THE PROBLEM OF BASIS FOR HYPERQUASIVARIETIES\n\n7\n\nProposition 5.4. If \u03a3 is a set of identities of type \u03c4 , closed under M-hyperH (\u03a3).\nsubstitution rule, (6)M , then E(\u03a3) = EM\nProof. A proof is similar as those of [8], p. 121-122. The only difference is\nthat considered hypersubstituions \u03c3 may vary only within members of M . \u0003\nRecall from [5] that hyperidentities (especially in the theory of Boolean algebras) has natural interpretations in the theory of swiching circuts. Therefore\nour observation may have some applications in algebraic computation.\n6. Conclusion\nBy other words, we observed that solid quasivarieties are always defined by\na hyperbasis. Moreover, the set of all quasi-identities satisfied in a quasivariety\nQV is satisfied in QV as hyperquasi-dentities if and only if QV is solid.\nA suitable generalization of our observations made for the set \u03a3(\u03c4 ) of all\nhypersubstitutions can be extended to any subset of \u03a3(\u03c4 ), closed under superposition. This generalization gives rise to so called M-hypersubstitutions of a\ngiven type. We consider the set \u03a3(\u03c4 ) of all hypersubstitutions of a given type\nwith the superposition operation \u25e6 i.e. with the composition of hypersubstitutions) and consider the structure (\u03a3(\u03c4 ), \u25e6) as a monoid. We call it the monoid\nof all hypersubstitutions of a given type \u03c4 .\nLet M be a subset of \u03a3(\u03c4 ) closed under superposition \u25e6, i.e. a submonoid\n(M, \u25e6) of the monoid (\u03a3(\u03c4 ), \u25e6) .\nDefinition 6.1. A (hyper)quasi-identity e is satisfied as an M-hyper-quasiidentity (is M-hypersatisfied) in an algebra A if and only if the following implication is satisfied:\nif \u03c3 is a hypersubstitution of type \u03c4 from the set M and the elements\na1 , ..., ak of A satisfy the equalities: \u03c3(ti )(a1 , ..., ak ) = \u03c3(si )(a1 , ..., ak ) in A for\ni = 1, ..., n \u2212 1, then the equality \u03c3(tn )(a1 , ..., ak ) = \u03c3(sn )(a1 , ..., ak ) holds in\nA.\nIn that case we write:\nA |=H\nM (t0 = s0 ) \u2227 ... \u2227 (tn\u22121 = sn\u22121 ) \u2192 (tn = sn ).\nDefinition 6.2. Let QV be a a quasivariety, then QV is M-solid if and only\nif every M-derived algebra A\u03c3 belongs to QV , for every algebra A in QV and\n\u03c3 in M .\nWe write then, that\nQV = DM (QV )\n\n\f8\n\nE.,W.,GRACZY\u0143SKA\n\nIn [12] M-solid quasivarieties were called M-hyperquasivarieties.\nWe finalize our considerations by formulating a generalization of our main\ntheorem for the case of M-hypersubstitutions without giving details:\nMain Theorem 6.3. Let QV be a quasivariety defined by a set \u03a3 of quasiidentities. These quasi-identities are satisfied in QV as an M-hyper-quasiidentities if and only if QV is M-solid (is an M-hyperquasivariety). Moreover,\neach quasi-identity satisfied in an M-solid quasivariety QV is satisfied in QV\nas an M-hyper-quasi-identity and vice versa.\nProof. A proof is similar as those of the Main Theorem 4.1. The only restriction is that hypersubstitions \u03c3 and derived algebras B = A\u03c3 are considered\nfor all \u03c3 from a given monoid M .\n\u0003\nProposition 6.4. Let V be a variety defined by a set \u03a3 of identities. These\nidentities are satisfied in V as M-hyper-identities if and only if V is M-solid.\nMoreover, each identity satisfied in an M-solid variety V is satisfied in V as\nan M-hyper-identity, i.e. V is an M-hypervariety and vice versa.\nProof. The proof follows immediately from the Birkhoff's type theorem proved\nin [9]: a variety V is M-solid if and only if\nV = HSP DM (V ).\n\u0003\nRemark 4. Let us note that in case M is a trivial (i.e. 1-element) monoid\nof hypersubstitutions of a given type \u03c4 , then the satisfaction |=H\nM gives rise to\nthe satisfaction |= and the operator DM to the identity operator.\nIn case M = \u03a3(\u03c4 ) we get the notion of |=H considered in [11].\nAcknowledgements\nThe author expresses her thanks to the referees for their valuable comments.\nReferences\n[1] G.
