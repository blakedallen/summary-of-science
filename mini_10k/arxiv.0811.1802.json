Zhang is in error and\nviolates well-known theorems.\n\nAfter receiving an electronic reprint of Zhang's recent paper [1] some time\nago, I have had an email exchange with the author pointing out a number\nof errors in the paper, which unfortunately invalidate all its main results.\nAs now also follow-up papers [2, 3] have appeared using Zhang's erroneous\nresults, I felt finally compelled to write down some of my criticism. The\neditor of the journal has supplied me with copies of a competing comment\n\u2217\n\nSupported by NSF grantPHY 07-58139\nEmail: perk@okstate.edu\n\u2021\nPermanent address\n\u2020\n\n1\n\n\f[4] and Zhang's reply to it. Here I shall bring up several other issues with [1]\nthat are not discussed in [4].\nPutative \"exact solutions\" of the 3d Ising model have been advocated\nbefore, see e.g. [5, 6, 7]. In 1952 J.R. Maddox (the later editor of Nature)\nshowed his solution [5] of the 3d Ising model at the StatPhys 2 conference\nin Paris.1 The error in his calculation was caught at the meeting and was\nthe result of an incorrect application of the Jordan-Wigner transformation\n[8]. This error has been made also by Zhang in eqs. (15) and (16) [(3.3) and\n(3.4) on pages 12 and 13]2 of [1].\nUsing both Kaufman's original notations-see eq. (11) in [8]-and more\nmodern notations, the Jordan\u2013Wigner transformation is given by\nsj \u2261\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\u03c3jx\n\n=\uf8f0\n\nj\u22121\nY\n\nk=1\n\nisj Cj \u2261\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\u03c3jy\n\n=\uf8f0\n\nj\u22121\nY\n\nk=1\n\nCj \u2261\n\n\u2212\u03c3jz\n\n\uf8f9\n\ni\u03932k\u22121 \u03932k \uf8fb \u03932j\u22121,\n\uf8f9\n\ni\u03932k\u22121 \u03932k \uf8fb \u03932j ,\n\n= i\u03932j\u22121 \u03932j ,\n\n\u03932j\u22121 \u2261 Pj ,\n\n\u03932j \u2261 Qj .\n\n(1)\n\nIt is essential that all \u0393 matrices anticommute (\u0393k \u0393l = \u2212\u0393l \u0393k , k 6= l, but\n\u0393k2 = 1), in order to be able to use the theory of spinor representations of\nthe rotation group. In Zhang's paper [1], j runs from 1 to nl, corresponding\nto his (r, s) running from (1, 1) to (n, l), or j = (n \u2212 1)r + s. Then one finds,3\nX\n\nx\n\u03c3jx \u03c3j+1\n=\n\nX\n\ni\u03932j \u03932j+1 ,\n\n\u2212\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nX\n\n\u03c3jz =\n\nX\n\ni\u03932j\u22121 \u03932j ,\n\n(2)\n\nj\n\nagreeing with (15a) and (15c) [(3.3a) and (3.3c)] of [1], but one should have\nX\n\nx\n\u03c3jx \u03c3j+n\n=\n\nX\nj\n\nj\n\n\uf8ee\n\ni\u03932j \uf8f0\n\nj+n\u22121\nY\nk=j+1\n\n\uf8f9\n\ni\u03932k\u22121 \u03932k \uf8fb \u03932j+2n\u22121 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhereas in (15b) [(3.3b)] of [1] one finds a quadratic form equivalent to\nX\nj\n\n1\n2\n\nx\n\u03c3jx \u03c3j+n\n=\n\nX\n\ni\u03932j \u03932j+2n\u22121 .\n\n(4)\n\nj\n\nIn the proceedings he is called M. Maddox, with M for Monsieur (Mister in French).\nReferences to equations and pages of the arXiv preprint are given within square brack-\n\nets.\n3\n\nI omit here the extra U -factors in the terms j = nk (for k = 1, . . . , l) resulting from\nperiodic boundary conditions [8], which are also present in [1]. With open boundary\nconditions there are no such U 's.\n\n2\n\n\fThere is a corresponding error in (16) [(3.4)] of [1], as one can verify that the\nP 's and the Q's there do not all anticommute as is required.4\nThis is the first major error in [1]. Therefore, Zhang has gotten a free\nfermion model in three dimensions in his formulae (15), just like Maddox\n[5]. The U factors in (15) are irrelevant, since Zhang could have started with\nopen boundary conditions. In the thermodynamic limit for the bulk free\nenergy per site the boundary terms have no effect because of the Bogoliubov\ninequality, as the surface to volume ratio vanishes for the infinite system.\nAfter this error there is no need to go to a fourth dimension as done in (17)\non page 5317 [(3.5) on page 14] of [1]; Maddox's result follows more directly.\nThe high-order terms in (3) above and in the corresponding exponential\nfactors of the transfer matrix render the 3d Ising model inaccessible to exact\nsolution. Barry Cipra, Sorin Istrail and others have even claimed that the\n3d Ising model is NP-complete [9]. This means that one should not expect a\nsimple closed-form solution similar to the one of the 2d Ising model in zero\nfield to exist.\nOne of the main results of [1] is formula (49) for the partition function\nper site on page 5325 [(3.37) on page 26], which has three parameters given\nin the appendix. On page 5399 [page 137] one finds eqs. (A.1), (A.2) and\nthe following text, where these three parameters are expressed as wx = 1,\nwy = wz equal to an expression with the coefficients b0 through b10 fitted such\nthat the high-temperature series is recovered. Therefore, this expression for\nthe free energy contains no more information than the known coefficients of\nthe high-temperature series used.\nOn page 5400 [page 139] Zhang insists that wy = wz \u2261 0 as soon as\nthe temperature is finite. This is discussed further in eqs. (A.11)\u2013(A.13) on\npages 5405\u20135406 [pages 145\u2013146], with \u03ba the usual high-temperature variable\ntanh K. There is a marked difference between the \"high-temperature limit\"\n(A.11) and eq. (A.13) for more general temperature, as the author chooses\nwx = 1, and wy = wz = 0, as soon as the temperature is finite, which is\nhighly inconsistent with the earlier fit.\nIndeed, the procedure is clearly wrong as the convergence of the hightemperature series has been rigorously proved in the 1960s [10, 11] and this\nproof has been quoted in many textbooks [12, 13, 14]. This proof is based on\n4\n\nLou and Wu [7] correctly apply an equation equivalent to (3) (using Z for \u03c3 x and X for\n\u2212\u03c3 ). However, they go wrong after (77) in [7], as they assume too much commutativity\nfor the factors of P . I thank Dr. Zhang for bringing [7] to my attention.\nz\n\n3\n\n\fthe proof of Gallavotti and Miracle-Sol\u00e9 [10] of the convergence of the fugacity\nexpansion by a use of the Kirkwood\u2013Salzburg equations for the lattice-gas,\nwhich is equivalent to the Ising model. Another theorem of Lebowitz and\nPenrose [11] is then used to establish a finite radius of convergence for the\ncorrelation functions and the free energy expressed as series in 1/T . They\nare even real analytic up to a critical point [11, 13]. Paper [1] therefore\nviolates well-established theorems. The statements on page 5376 [page 102]\nare, therefore, manifestly wrong.\nAnother criticism concerns the result for the spontaneous magnetization\ngiven in eqs. (102) and (103) on page 5342 [(4.28) and (4.29) on page 50]. This\ncan be expanded as I = 1 \u2212 6x8 + . . ., with x = exp(\u22122K), with K = J/kB T .\nHowever, in Table 2 on page 5380 [page 154] one finds I = 1 \u2212 2x6 + . . .,\ntaken from the well-known low-temperature series in the literature. That\nI \u2212 1 starts with x8 , corresponds to the fact that each site in 4d has 8\nneighbors; it should be x6 for 6 neighbors in 3d. Zhang's result is analytic in\nthe low-temperature variable x, up to his critical point and it also gives the\nexact value I = 1 at T = 0. It has a finite radius of convergence expanded\nas a series in x. Therefore, it must agree with the well-known series result in\nTable 2, which it does not.\nIt has also been established that in the ferromagnetic Ising model the\nthermodynamic bulk limit converges to a unique state, apart from H = 0,\nT < Tc where the state can be any convex combination of the states obtained\nby the infinite-volume limits with all boundary spins up or all down, see\n[14] and references quoted. One can then study an infinite hierarchy of a\ndiscrete version of the Schwinger\u2013Dyson equations connecting the correlation\nfunctions with an odd number of spins in the thermodynamic limit with all\nspins up on the boundary. This way one can easily and rigorously establish\nthe start of the low-temperature series for the spontaneous magnetization,\nin agreement with the old results in the literature. Hence, because of the\ndiscrepancy, Zhang's result is manifestly wrong.\nMuch more can be said about the correlation functions, susceptibility,\nand critical exponents in sections 5, 6, and 7. Again, all the main results are\nin error. I will not go into more detail as this should already be clear from\nthe arguments above.\n\n4\n\n\fReferences\n[1] Z.-D. Zhang, Philos.
