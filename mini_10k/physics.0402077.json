These states form electronic series which\nconverge towards the ionization limit of the molecule.\nThe starting point of the quantum analysis of such states was the Quantum\nDefect Theory (see e.g. the review article by Seaton [1]), established first for\natoms. It was shown that, due to the non zero spatial extension of the ionic\ncore, the levels near the ionization limit follow the hydrogenic Rydberg law\nEn = \u2212Ry/(n+ d)2 , with only a constant (or nearly so) shift d of the principal\nquantum number n, entitled Quantum Defect. Quantum Defect Theory was\nextended to a Multichannel Quantum Defect Theory (MQDT), for the case\nthat there are several series which converge to nearby states of the ion, and\ninteract strongly. It was shown that MQDT gives a unified theory of bound\nstates, autoionizing states and electron-ion scattering cross sections. This theory depends only on a small number of parameters, basically one quantum\ndefect per interacting series. Practically, all is solved with matrices whose size\nis the number of series, while \"brute force\" methods would in principle try\nto diagonalize a matrix which contains an infinite number of levels for each\nseries.\nThis theory was extended to molecules by Fano [2,3]. There are always many\ninteracting series corresponding to the rotational states of the ionic core. Indeed the slow velocity of the core rotation leads to a splitting of the rotational\nstates of the core which is of the same order of magnitude as the splitting\nbetween high lying electronic Rydberg states. The novelty were the implications of the anisotropy of the core. The effect of this anisotropy on the ionic\npotential decays faster with distance r than the point charge 1/r Coulomb potential, at least as 1/r 2 or 1/r 3 . Fano showed that the key point of the analysis\nis the existence of a cut off distance r0 . Below this distance the motion of the\nouter electron is tightly bound to the direction of the ionic core, above it the\ntwo become independent. Many detailed studies have followed on moderately\nexcited Rydberg states of molecules, see e.g. reviews in refs. [4,5].\nA novelty resulting from the studies of very high lying states of molecular Rydberg series was the experimental observation of \"clear zones\" in such interacting series. It was soon understood that this so called \"stroboscopic effect\"\ncorresponds to resonances between the period of rotation of the core and the\nperiod of the outer electron orbit [6,7]. In order to study the relationship of\nthis phenomenon with classical and quantum chaos, the classical limit of the\nMQDT theory was established [8]. A Poincar\u00e9 surface of section was introduced, whose coordinates correspond to parameters of the molecular system\nwhen the electron leaves the sphere of radius r0 . The studies showed that the\n\"stroboscopic effect\" corresponds to a periodic reestablishment of a nearly\nintegrable phase space structure at each resonance, while the classical phase\nspace is completely chaotic in between.\n2\n\n\fThe impetus for the present study was given by papers of Bogomolny where he\nintroduces a semi-classical method for the quantization of a classical Poincar\u00e9\nsurface of section Map (PM) [9,10,11], and some other follow up papers, e.g.\n[12]. The original semi-classical method is not unique and is prone to singularity problems, thereby raising the question about its relationship with a true\nquantization. We followed exactly the opposite route, starting from a purely\nquantum method (MQDT), establishing its classical limit, and at last studying\nPoincar\u00e9 surfaces of sections. Our system is ideal for the study of this problem\nbecause we know in advance the correct result. Furthermore our system has an\nunusual and non trivial geometry, the phase space being a sphere. For bound\nsystems, a preliminary report of the interpretation of MQDT as a Quantum\nPoincar\u00e9 Map (QPM) was provided in ref. [13]. However, the relationship with\nthe theory of Bogomolny was only a formal analogy of the final quantum and\nsemi-classical formulae used to compute the levels. In this paper we study and\ncompare step by step classical, semi-classical and quantum descriptions of the\nsame system.\nAnother important property of the MQDT is, that it describes bound and\nionized states in a unified way. Hence, we may use it to study the quantization\nof the so called Jung Scattering Map (JSM) for ionized states [14]. Indeed\nJung proposed to send back ionizing trajectories onto the molecule in a well\nprescribed way, in order to obtain a of compactification of the phase space for\nabove threshold states. The role of the JSM in this context, has been touched\nupon previously to elucidate certain properties of the S-matrix [15]. In the\nlight of the reinterpretation of MQDT as a QPM for bound systems it seems\nvery attractive to attempt a comprehensive description, which extends the\nadvantages outlined in ref. [13] to include both scattering, bound states and\nresonances.\nThe purpose of this paper is to present a classical map which combines the PM\nfor the part of the phase space corresponding to negative energies of the excited\nelectron with the JSM for the positive energy region, and then to interpret\nMQDT as the quantization of the resulting symplectic map. This will provide\nbasically two advantages. On one hand a conceptual advantage, as the method\nand its approximation can be formulated in the context of a classical map\nand its subsequent quantization. In particular, we will see that phase space\nrepresentations of wavefunctions for open channels quantize on trajectories of\nthe JSM in the same way as bound states and ionization resonances quantize\non trajectories of the PM. On the other hand on a more practical level, the\ndynamics is shown to be semi-separable [12,16] which permits a decomposition\ninto separable steps, and suggests to choose a surface of section such that it\nseparates these steps. Consequently, the QPM for half an evolution step of the\nsystem contains the relevant information, and its diagonalization will permit\nto find eigenvalues, eigenvectors, the level dynamics, etc in a simplified way.\nThis will be particularly useful when dealing with near degenerate levels or\n3\n\n\fresonances which occur frequently and cause considerable difficulties in the\nconventional approach [13,17].\nIn the next section we shall develop the generalized classical PM, which includes the JSM for the particular conditions of a Rydberg molecule. In the\nthird section we shall present the main result of this paper. MQDT for bound\nstates and open systems will be formulated as a generalized QPM. In both\nthese sections attention will be given to relaxing the common approximation to keep the absolute value of the electron angular momentum fixed. In\nsection four we shall discuss applications and show numerical examples that\ndemonstrate the practical advantages of this method and may also give some\nnew insight in situations of quantum chaotic scattering. These examples will\nexclusively be given within the approximation of fixed absolute value of the\nelectron angular momentum, mainly to show nice two dimensional plots of\nsurfaces of section. As the QPM was originally proposed in a semi-classical\napproximation [9,10,11], we shall in section 5 compare the approximate results\nof semi-classics to the ones of the \"exact\" QPM. We shall see that singularities\ncausing problems in semi-classics are absent in the QPM. Therefore the QPM\ncan be used to test regularization procedures for semi-classics.\n\n2\n\nGeneralized classical Poincar\u00e9 map for Rydberg molecules\n\n2.1 Principle\nA Rydberg molecule is composed of an ionic positively charged molecular\ncore and an outer electron. It is specifically given the name \"Rydberg\" when\none considers states just below or above the ionization threshold, where the\nouter electron performs large excursions far away from the core. This situation allows to define a distance r0 which separates the potential felt by the\nouter electron into a long range Coulomb part, and a short range or collision\npart. In the long range part, the outer electron only feels the spherically symmetric \u22121/r Coulomb potential of the core (we use throughout the \"atomic\nunits\" (a.u.) e = ~ = m = 1). Its motion is comparatively slow because one\nconsiders states near the ionization limit, but it can be either bound or unbound. The electron moves along a Kepler orbit whose plane and axis are fixed\nin the laboratory frame. Meanwhile, the ionic core rotates freely around its\nangular momentum N. In the collision area the electron feels the lower symmetry, faster decreasing, part of the potential of the core (dipolar (\u221d 1/r 2 ) or\nquadrupolar (\u221d 1/r 3 ) for a diatomic molecule) and it is strongly accelerated.\nThis strong acceleration leads to a short range collision motion, which is approximately the same for a total energy slightly below or above the ionization\nthreshold, since the difference between the corresponding velocities is negligi4\n\n\fr0\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 1. (a) The outer electron follows a Kepler orbit, fixed in space, for large\ndistances r > r0 and changes the Kepler orbit for r < r0 by interaction with the\nshort range part of the ionic core potential. (b) When the electron ionizes the Jung's\nrecipe is to feed back the electron which escapes to infinity by doing a step backwards\nin time without collision with the core (i.e. a pure Kepler hyperbola with reverted\nvelocity), and then re launch the electron towards the molecule along the resulting\nasymptotic trajectory for the next collision.\n\nble compared to the velocity produced by the acceleration. This is basically\nthe reason why in quantum mechanics MQDT treats bound and unbound\nstates in a unified way. During the collision there is exchange both of angular\nmomentum and energy between the electron and the core. The exchange of\nangular momentum implies a change of the plane of the Kepler orbit, since the\nangular momentum of the electron L is perpendicular to its plane (Fig. 1(a)).\nThe exchange of energy leads to a variation of the eccentricity of the orbit,\nand may turn it into an ionizing trajectory. In this case the Jung's recipe [14]\nis to feed back the electron which escapes to infinity by doing a step backwards in time without collision with the core (i.e. a pure Coulomb step with\nreverted velocity), and then re launch the electron towards the molecule along\nthe resulting asymptotic trajectory (Fig. 1(b)). By doing this, one obtains\ntrajectories which cross infinitely many times the r = r0 sphere. Poincar\u00e9 surfaces of section are described by a set of parameters of the molecular system\nat those instants where the electron crosses outwards the sphere. To define\nthese parameters (several sets are possible) we first need to define precisely\nthe reference frames and count the number of independent parameters for the\ndetermination of the dimension of this Poincar\u00e9 surface of section.\n2.2 Reference frames\nIn this work, we will use three reference frames, the laboratory frame and\ntwo molecular reference frames, entitled \"quantum\" and \"classical\" reference\nframes. They are shown in Fig. 2.\n5\n\n\fz\nZQ\n\nJ\n\n\u03b8M\n\n(a)\n\nY\n\nQ\n\ny\n\u03c6\n\nM\n\nx\n\nZQ\nJ\n\n\u03b8M\n\n(b)\n\nN\nXQ\n\nYQ\n\nZC\n\nL\n\n(c)\n\n\u03b8\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b1\n\nN\n\n\u03c6\n\nYC\n\nXC\n\nFig. 2. Reference frames for the molecular system. (a) Laboratory frame. Its Oz axis\nis selected along the total angular momentum J (b) \"Quantum\" molecular reference\nframe. Obtained from the laboratory frame with a rotation of Euler angles \u03c6M , \u03b8M ,\n0. Its OZQ axis is along the molecular axis M\u0302. (c) \"Classical\" molecular reference\nframe. It is obtained from the \"quantum\" by a rotation around M\u0302 which brings the\nOXC axis along the angular momentum N of the core. This frame is physically the\nmost significant, and all other figures of this paper are drawn with this convention.\n\n6\n\n\f(a) Laboratory frame. Due to the global rotational invariance which entails\nconservation of the total angular momentum J, we can select, without\nloss of generality, its Oz axis along the total angular momentum J. The\nother two axis are arbitrary (but fixed). In this frame the axis M\u0302 of the\ncore has (varying) polar angles \u03b8M and \u03c6M .\n(b) \"Quantum\" molecular reference frame. It is obtained by a rotation of the\nlaboratory frame by the Euler angles \u03b8M , \u03c6M , 0 (as common in quantum\nmechanics [18] we use the y convention for the Euler angles [19, Appendix\nB]). We entitled it \"quantum\" because it is the frame used in the quantum theory of molecules. The third Euler angle is arbitrary for a diatomic\nmolecule, and is sometimes selected as \u03c0/2 [20] for normalization reasons,\nwhich do not concern us here. Therefore, we prefer to stick to the conventions of the first paper by Fano [2]. We restrict to the diatomic case\nfor simplicity, a third Euler angle would be necessary for a polyatomic\ncore. In this frame J lies in the \"vertical\" plane OXQ YQ . The angular\nmomentum of the core N for a diatomic molecule is perpendicular to the\ncore axis M\u0302, because the moment of inertia of the core around it is zero.\nIt is thus in the \"horizontal\" plane OXQ YQ .\n(c) \"Classical\" molecular reference frame. This frame is obtained from the\n\"quantum\" frame by a rotation around OZQ = OZC such that the new\nOXC axis is along N. As will become obvious below, from the physical\npoint of view this frame is the most appropriate for the visualization of\nthe results. As in previous publications [8,13,15,17,21] we will use it in\nall figures of this paper.\nFormulas to go from one reference frame to the others are obtained from simple\ngeometric arguments based on the previous remarks, and are established in\nAppendix A.\n\n2.3 Count of parameters and the dimension of the Poincar\u00e9 surface of section\n\nThe configuration space is described by five coordinates in the laboratory\nframe. Two angles \u03b8M , \u03c6M describe the position of the axis of the diatomic\nionic core (a third would be necessary for a polyatomic core). Two angles\n\u03b8e , \u03c6e and a radial distance r describe the position of the electron. Thus configuration space has a dimension of five and phase space has a dimension of\nten. Conservation of the total angular momentum J reduces the dimension of\nphase space by 4, two for the Poisson commuting actions Jz and J 2 , and two\nfor the associated angles. The first angle can be selected as the polar angle\n\u03c6J associated with Jz , that is the angle of the projection of J onto the laboratory plane Oxy, which is constant (with our choice of the laboratory axis\nit is in fact undetermined but this is of no importance). The second can be\na global rotation angle around J associated to J 2 , which is cyclic (but not\n7\n\n\fconstant): see e.g. the analogous reduction to the {j1 , j2 , j3 , w1 , w2 , w3 } action\nangle system for the pure Kepler problem in [19, Chap. 10-7]. Consequently,\nthe dimension of the reduced phase space in the general case is six, and a\nPoincar\u00e9 surface of section has dimension four.\nThe introduction of the auxiliary approximation that the modulus L of the\nangular momentum L of the electron is conserved during the collision reduces the dimension of the phase space by two (L2 and the associated angle),\nand thus the Poincar\u00e9 surface of section has dimension two, which enables\ngraphical representations. This approximation was used in our previous works\n[8,13,15,17,21], and is valid in the experimental works which motivated the\ntheoretical study [6,7]. The reason for its validity is that the splitting between\ndifferent electronic L2 levels produced by the spherically symmetric part of the\npotential of the core is much larger than the splitting between sub levels of\nL2 , produced by its anisotropic part. In the experiments, L takes low values,\nrestricted to 0. . . 2 by a two steps laser excitation. Here, however we want to\nstudy the semi classical limit, where the angular momenta take large values.\nThere are two possibilties to increase angular momenta. First we can increase\nthem without changing other molecular parameters. This is experimentally\npossible since the application of R.F. fields [22] or of combined electric and\nmagnetic fields [23] in atomic Rydberg states enable to climb the L ladder\nup to circular orbits. In this case the constant L approximation breaks down\nfor higher L. A study of the consequences for this case has been performed in\nref. [24]. However, this is not what we aim at, since it implies a complete change\nof the physics of the problem at hand. We want to gain insight into the physics\nof the experimental works in refs. [6,7], by establishing its semi-classical limit.\nMathematically this amounts to letting ~ \u2192 0 while keeping all classical parameters constant. Practically, since ~ is a constant of nature (taken as 1 in\natomic units), this requires the increase of all classical parameters while keeping constant their dimensionless ratios. For example, decreasing ~ by a factor\nof m implies to multiplication of all momenta by m, angular L, J, N, and\nprincipal, n. The Kepler period Te of the orbital motion of the electron, which\nis proportional to n3 is thus multiplied by m3 , the period TN of the rotational\nmotion of the core which is proportional to I/N (where I is the moment of\ninertia of the core) must be multiplied by the same factor, so that I scales as\nm4 . Similarly, one must scale the ratio between the geometric size of the core\nand the De Broglie wavelength, keeping constant the core's shape parameters\n(ratio anisotropic / isotropic). This maintains constant the ratio of the classical periods associated with L, due to the isotropic part of the short range\npotential, and with \u039b = L * M\u0302, due to the torque produced by the anisotropic\npart of this short range potential. This maintains the validity of the approximation of constant L. Of course this needs proportionally larger molecules,\nmore difficult experimentally to deal with, but not completely out of reach\nsince recent experimental studies have found Rydberg states on molecules as\nlarge as Benzene Argon complexes [25], Diazacyclooctane (DABCO) and bis\n8\n\n\f(benzene) chromium (BBC) [26].\nThus, for practical reasons, we shall continue to use the constant L approximation in many formulae and all pictures presented in this article. Yet we shall\nshow, especially in the present and the next sections, that these restrictions\nare not essential for the interpretation of MQDT as a QPM, and how formulae\ncan be generalized.\nFinally notice that in ref. [21], we started with only seven parameters. The\nthree missing parameters were the three angles associated to the three conserved momenta J 2 , Jz and L2 . This is legitimate in classical mechanics since\nthey can be computed afterwards by a mere quadrature. For the comparison between classical and quantum mechanics, which is the main purpose of\nthis work, this is natural since these angles are totally undetermined due to\nHeisenberg's uncertainty principle for well defined values of the corresponding\nmomenta.\n\n2.4 Parameterizations of the Poincar\u00e9 surface of section\n\nWe first discuss the case of constant L. For a proper parameterization of a\ntwo dimensional Poincar\u00e9 surface of section, we need two conjugated parameters, a momentum and an angle. We will not use the most obvious angles\n\u03b8e , \u03c6e of the electron and their conjugated momenta, but angles associated\nwith angular momenta LZQ of the electron and N of the core because in the\nquantum MQDT description of the molecule, these momenta enter naturally\nas (approximate) quantum numbers for the limiting cases [2]. There are different choices, depending on whether we work in the molecular or the laboratory\nframe.\n(1) \"Quantum\" molecular frame. We use the projection \u039b = LZQ = L * M\u0302\nof the electron angular momentum onto the core axis, and the angle\n\u03c6Q\nL , the azimuthal angle of the projection of L into the horizontal plane\nOXQ YQ , conjugated like the j1 , w1 pair in [19, eq. 10-139]. This choice\nof parameters implies that the Poincar\u00e9 surface of section is a sphere\non which every point is defined by \u03b8LQ = arccos(\u039b/L) and \u03c6Q\nL , i.e. the\ndirection of L in the molecular frame.\n(2) Laboratory frame. We use the modulus N of the angular momentum of\nthe core (not one of its projection onto laboratory frame). Intuitively,\nthe associated angle is the angle of rotation \u03c6N of the molecular core M\u0302\naround the direction of N, and the only possible reference for this angle is\ngiven by the direction of the total angular momentum J. A proof of this\nintuition, namely a precise definition of this angle, formulae relating the\npairs { LZQ , \u03c6Q\nL } and { N, \u03c6N }, and the proof that this transformation\n9\n\n\fis canonical is given in Appendix A.1.\n(3) \"Classical\" molecular frame. We use LZC = LZQ (the two Z axis coincide),\nand \u03c6C\nL , the angle referred to N in the \"horizontal\" plane (Fig. 2(c)). Notice that this pair is not conjugated, as discussed in section 5.1. The\nconsequence is that the Poincar\u00e9 map does not conserve the area of the\nsphere with these coordinates, a small effect for the choice of parameters\nwe have used in this paper. We stick nevertheless to this choice for graphical representations, because it gives more intuitive physical pictures as\nshown below.\nNotice that with this choice of parameters, the direction of the plane of the\nKepler orbit is well determined in the molecular frame, since it is perpendicular\nto L, and its eccentricity is well determined by L and the electron energy Ee ,\nbut that the direction of its main axis in this plane, i.e. the Laplace-RungeLenz vector A [19], is not. As explained in ref. [8], the reason for this is that\nno component of A , which defines this major axis, commutes with L2 which\nis kept fixed. Our counting of parameters implies that the direction of A is\nnot an independent parameter.\nIntroducing the approximation that L is a constant has as a consequence that\nthe information about the main axis direction is hidden in the angle associated\nto L2 . Then, the choice of action angle variables corresponds to that typically\nused in the pure bound Kepler problem\nin celestial mechanics [19]. The actions\nq\nare j1 = Lz , j2 = L and j3 = \u22121/2Ee (i.e. \"principal quantum number\").\nThe associated angles are the \"longitude of the ascending node\" \u03a9 (= \u03c6L +\u03c0/2\nwith our notations), the \"argument of the perihelion\" \u03c9, which is the direction\nof the main axis in the orbital plane (or the direction of A in this plane) we are\nlooking for, and the \"mean anomaly\" which is proportional to time. Thus, the\nangle of the main axis of the ellipse, which is constant for pure Kepler motion,\ni.e. for Rydberg molecules when the electron is far away from the core, but\nvaries during the collision, is part of the map only, if the approximation L2\nconstant is omitted.\n\n2.5 Description of the classical Poincar\u00e9 map\n\nWe now briefly describe the PM, both in the laboratory and in the molecular\nframe. The dynamics is composed of two independent consecutive steps:\n(i) collision step: when r \u226a r0 the electron feels the short range anisotropic\npart of the potential. We suppose that this step is very short, so that the\ncore axis remains fixed (impulse approximation). It is thus best described\nin the molecular frame. Due to the cylindrical symmetry of this potential\nthe projection \u039b = L * M\u0302 of L onto the core axis M\u0302 is conserved. With\n10\n\n\fthe auxiliary approximation that L2 is constant, this amounts to the\ncollision being described by a precession of L around M\u0302 by an angle\n\u03b4\u03c6L . Furthermore the invariance of the potential under reflection with\nrespect to any plane containing M\u0302 implies that \u03b4\u03c6L is odd with respect\nto \u03b8L \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8L . The simplest choice is \u03b4\u03c6L = K cos \u03b8L , which defines\nthe strength K of the interaction. Notice that this \u03b8L dependant rotation\nabout the OZ molecular axis is a twist, not a global rotation of the sphere,\nimplying that the dynamics generated by the map can be chaotic [27,28].\nSince L has changed, at least in direction if we make the approximation\nL2 constant, due to the the conservation of total angular momentum\nJ = L + N, N changes both in direction and in magnitude. This has far\nreaching consequences. The change of the magnitude entails a change of\nthe rotational energy of the core EN = BN 2 (2B is the reciprocal of the\ncore moment of inertia I according to usual spectroscopic notation [29]).\nConsequently, due to the conservation of the total energy E the electron's\nenergy Ee = E \u2212 EN also changes. If Ee becomes positive the molecule\nionizes, if it remains negative the resulting changes of Te and TN will\nchange the parameters of the next Coulomb step. While the \"quantum\"\nmolecular reference frame is fixed during the collision, in the \"classical\"\nmolecular reference frame, its OXC axis, which is chosen along N, will\nchange (Fig. 2(c)). This produces an additional phaseshift \u03b4\u03c6\u2032L , which\nwas called frame recoil in ref. [8] where explicit formulae are given. It\ncan also be computed from eq. (A.3) of Appendix A.1, which gives the\nangular position of N in the fixed \"quantum\" molecular frame, by taking\nthe difference of positions before and after the \u03b4\u03c6L kick.\n(ii) Coulomb (or free rotation) step: when r \u226b r0 the electron only feels\nthe spherically symmetric \u22121/r part of the potential. It moves on a Kepler orbit. Its angular momentum L and its Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector\nA are constant in the laboratory Oxyz reference frame. Meanwhile the\nmolecular core rotates at constant speed around its angular momentum\nN which is perpendicular to its axis M\u0302. When seen in the \"classical\"\nmolecular frame, with OZ along M\u0302 and OXC along N (Fig. 2(c)), L\n(and A) seem to rotate the opposite way (clockwise) around OXC . The\ntotal angle of rotation is \u03b4\u03b2 = \u22122\u03c0Te /TN , i.e. the ratio of the periods of\nthe electron orbit and of the core rotation. We have Te = 2\u03c0(\u22122Ee )3/2\na.u. and TN = 2\u03c0/2BN a.u..\nThe crucial point of this model is the exchange of energy between the electron\nand the core during the collision step. If we neglected it the model would coincide with with a \"kicked spin\" model [30,31], which cannot lead to ionization.\nFor the free rotation step we prefer to visualize the results in the \"classical\"\nmolecular frame. Indeed in the \"quantum\" molecular frame the free rotation\nis about a direction of N in the molecular OXQ YQ plane (see Fig. 2(b)), which\nvaries from step to step. We will visualize ionization on the Poincar\u00e9 sphere in\n11\n\n\fthe \"classical\" frame by noting that positive electron energies Ee correspond\nto points where the total energy E is greater than the rotational energy EN .\nUsing J2 = (L + N)2 , this leads to the inequality\n\u0012\n\nEN = BN 2 = B \u2212L cos \u03b1 +\n\nq\n\nJ 2 \u2212 L2 sin2 \u03b1\n\n\u00132\n\n<E\n\n(1)\n\nThis condition only depends on the angle \u03b1 between L and N and accordingly\nthe positive electron energy region corresponds to a cap around the positive\nN axis, which is fixed in this frame (Fig. 2(c)). If we relax the condition L2\nconstant, we have a four dimensional PM and formulae for the collision and\nthe recoil are modified, but eq. (1) remains valid.\nPractically, there are two possibilities to compute the classical PM. In all our\nprevious works, we considered it entirely in the \"classical\" molecular reference\nframe, by computing in turn free rotation, collision \u03b4\u03c6L , frame recoil, new\nvalues of N, EN , TN , Ee , Te and plotting the results in the \"classical\" reference\nframe by using equations given in Appendix A.1. In the present work we\nalternate between laboratory frame and \"quantum\" reference frame, in a way\nsummarized in the first three columns of table 1 (the last two will be filled\nbelow in sections 3 and 5). We choose this more complex, and thus slower,\nprocedure, because as outlined in section 5, the coordinates in the \"classical\"\nreference frame are not canonically conjugate. This is of no harm for purely\nclassical computations, but forbids the semi-classical analysis. Of course we\nhave checked that both representations give the same results.\nFinally we will describe how to construct the combined Poincar\u00e9\u2013Jung scattering map. The JSM is defined such that the electron which escapes to infinity\nis fed back by doing a step backwards in time without collision with the core\n(i.e. a pure Coulomb step with reverted velocity), and then re launching the\nelectron towards the molecule along the resulting asymptotic trajectory for\nthe next collision (Fig. 1(b)). Notice that L and A are constant in the laboratory frame during such a pure Coulomb step. For the L2 constant case\nthis amounts to starting from the same point on the Poincar\u00e9 sphere in the\nmolecular frame if Ee > 0 after a collision, i.e. to skip the three first steps\nin Table 1. Indeed the rotation of the core is neglected during the impulse\ncollision step, and during journeys to and from infinity of the electron these\nrotations cancel since they are made for r > r0 , where the short range potential is negligible. In the general case the \"argument of the perihelion\" \u03c9 is also\nconserved. The proper JSM is a map from ionized to ionized states, the PM\na map from bound to bound states, but there is obviously no technical problem to iterate a combined map from unbound to bound states and vice versa\nby selecting the JSM recipe to feed back ionizing trajectories. This seemingly\nstrange feed back was suggested and discussed in ref. [14]. We shall show that\nit is indeed a good representation of the results in quantum mechanics under\nsemi-classical conditions.\n12\n\n\fTable 1\nPoincar\u00e9 Map: summary.

We\nwill outline here only what is needed for our purposes. The theory closely\nparallels the preceding classical ideas, which originated from the classical limit\nof MQDT, but which were implicitly present in Fano's seminal paper [2], albeit\nwith a fully quantum way of writing down the theory. Wave functions have\ndifferent forms for r . r0 and r & r0 and they are matched at r = r0 . Going\nfrom r = 0 to r = \u221e we have\n(i) Collision step: r . r0 . The electron's motion is rigidly coupled to the\nmolecular axis M\u0302. Its speed exceeds by far the speed of the motions\nof the nuclei of the molecular ion and the Born-Oppenheimer factorization of the molecular wave function applies (Hund's case (b) coupling\ntype according to molecular spectroscopy nomenclature[29]). Due to the\ncylindrical symmetry of the potential the projection \u039b = L * M\u0302 of the\nelectron's angular momentum onto the molecular axis M\u0302 is a constant of\nthe motion, whereas the squared angular momentum N2 of the molecular\nion rotation does not have a definite value. We may or may not have a\ndefinite value of L2 depending on the use of the auxiliary approximation\n13\n\n\fL2 = const. The angular part of the wave function is thus an eigen(J,\u039b)\nfunction of \u039b (in addition to J and MJ ) denoted by XMJ (\u03b8e\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032e , M\u0302)\n[2], where (\u03b8e\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032e ) are the angular coordinates of the Rydberg electron in\nthe \"quantum\" molecular reference frame OXQ YQ ZQ defined in Fig. 2(b)\nand Appendix A. For r \u223c r0 , i.e. outside of the molecular core, where\nthe potential is approximately pure Coulomb, the radial part of the Rydberg electron wave function is a linear combination of two independent\nCoulomb functions. We choose the one regular at r = 0, s(Ee , r), as well\nas one irregular at r = 0, c(Ee , r), suitably selected for its asymptotic\nproperties when r \u2192 \u221e [1]. The normalized total wave function reads [2]\nas\n(L,J,\u039b)\n\n\u03a8\u039b (\u03b8e\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032e , M\u0302; r) = XMJ\n\n(\u03b8e\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032e , M\u0302) (s(Ee , r) cos(\u03c0\u03bc\u039b ) + c(Ee , r) sin(\u03c0\u03bc\u039b )) .\n(2)\nThis implicitely defines the \"quantum defects\" \u03bc\u039b . Notice that Ee depends on \u039b. If the subsidiary approximation L2 constant is not used, the\nX's are not eigenstates of L2 , but can be developed in such a basis, implying a summation over L and an extra label L on the \u03bc's and the Ee 's.\nThe quantum defects can in principle be computed by ab initio electronic\nmolecular calculations between r = 0 and r = r0 , but we will take them\nhere as semi empirical parameters, as is frequently done. We will assume\nthat they are independent of energy, in a restricted range above or below\nzero electron energy. This is justified by the fact that in the inner region\nthe change of the total energy is negligible as compared to the electron\nkinetic energy in the Coulomb well. The wave function in the collision\nregion should not depend significantly on such small variations of the\ntotal energy. For large distances there is a difference, leading to bound\nor unbound states. We will neglect refinements used in actual molecular\ncalculations to compute levels with somewhat lower principal quantum\nnumbers, for which one allows quantum defects to vary slowly with Ee .\n(ii) Coulomb step: r & r0 . The electron is coupled to the isotropic part of the\nCoulomb potential only, and cannot exchange angular momentum with\nthe core. The core angular momentum N and the electron angular momentum L are thus separately conserved, as is J = L + N. The angular\n(L,J,N )\npart of the wave function \u03a6MJ (\u03b8e , \u03c6e , M\u0302) corresponds to the coupling\nby a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient of an electron wave function labeled by L\nand of a molecular core wave function labeled by N (Hund's case (d) coupling type according to molecular spectroscopy nomenclature[29]). Here\n(\u03b8e , \u03c6e ) are the electron coordinates in the laboratory reference frame\nOxyz. The radial part of the wave function of the Rydberg electron is\nagain a linear combination of regular and irregular Coulomb wave functions. The total wave function reads\n(L,J,N )\n\n\u03a8N (\u03b8e , \u03c6e , M\u0302; r) = \u03a6MJ\n\n(\u03b8e , \u03c6e , M\u0302) (s(Ee , r) cN + c(Ee , r) dN ) ,\n14\n\n(3)\n\n\fwhere Ee = E \u2212BN(N +1) can be positive or negative and cN and dN are\nto be determined from asymptotic conditions. Here again an additional\nsummation over L is necessary when omitting the auxiliary approximation that L2 be conserved.\nFor r \u223c r0 we have one and the same wave function developed into two\ndifferent bases (2) and (3). The electron angular parts correspond to a change\nfrom the molecular frame to the laboratory frame.

(6) are obtained from the asymptotic properties of\nthe wave function for r \u2192 \u221e. These properties in turn depend on whether the\nelectronic energy in each asymptotic channel labeled by N, namely Ee = E \u2212\nBN(N + 1), is positive (open channels) or negative (closed channels).

(15):\n\nWriting down the components of |B(l)i,\nBN (l) =\n\nX\n\u039b\n\nC\u02c6N \u039b A\u039b (l)\n\n(22)\n\nwe see that the matrix C\u02c6 relates the eigenfunction for channel l in the molecular\nreference frame labeled by \u039b to that in the laboratory reference frame labeled\nby N. Note that eq. (22) is the same as eq. (14), except that the matrix T\u0302 is\ndefined for open channels only, while B is defined for all channels.\n17\n\n\fNext, consider the symmetric complex unitary matrix:\nE\u02c6t \u00ca = (C\u02c6t +i \u015c t )(C\u02c6 + i\u015c)\n\n(23)\n\n= (\u00ce \u2212 2 \u015c t \u015c) + 2i C\u02c6t \u015c,\n\nusing eqs. (19,20). This implies that if \u015c|A\u039b i = 0, then\nE\u02c6t \u00ca|A\u039b i = \u00ce|A\u039b i,\n\n(24)\n\ni.e. the solutions of eq. (15) are eigenvectors of E\u02c6t \u00ca with eigenvalue 1.\nSimilarly the |BN i are eigenvectors of \u00ca \u00ca t with eigenvalue 1\nE\u02c6 E\u02c6t |BN i = \u00ce|BN i\n\n(25)\n\nEqs. (24,25) imply the determinant equation\n\u02c6 = 0.\ndet(1 \u2212 \u00ca t E)\n\n(26)\n\nComparing this result with the equation for the T (En ) matrix defined by\nBogomolny [9,10,11] was essential for the interpretation of MQDT as a QPM\nin ref. [13]. We will examine this relation more closely in the next sections.\nFor scattering systems we have to go a little further, because we have to search\nfor the phase shifts at any energy rather than for eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. For this situation we shall derive another useful form of these equations.\nRemember that in this case vectors and matrices in eqs. (24,25) depend on the\nchannel number l and that the BN (l) are identical to the eigenvectors TN l of\nthe S matrix. We are looking for a set of equations written for open channels\nonly, whereas eq. (24) is written for all channels, open and closed. For this\npurpose we write eq. (25) in bloc diagonal form, splitting the N channels into\nopen channels indexed by o and closed channels indexed by c. This is possible\nfor elements indexed by the asymptotic quantum number N, e.g. E\u02c6 E\u02c6t , not for\n\u02c6 We\nthose indexed by the Born Oppenheimer quantum number \u039b, e.g. \u00ca t E.\nobtain\n(E\u02c6 E\u02c6t )oo Bo + (\u00ca E\u02c6t )oc Bc = Bo\n(E\u02c6 E\u02c6t )co Bo + (\u00ca \u00ca t )cc Bc = Bc\n\n(27)\n(28)\n\nEliminating Bc gives\n\u0012\n\n\u0010\n\n(E\u02c6 E\u02c6t )oo + (\u00ca E\u02c6t )oc \u00cecc \u2212 (\u00ca \u00ca t )cc\n18\n\n\u0011\u22121\n\nt\n\n\u0013\n\n(\u00ca \u00ca )co Bo = Bo\n\n(29)\n\n\fNotice then that we can rewrite eq. (17) as\nE\u02c6 = exp(i\u03c0\u03bd\u0302) \u00db exp(i\u03c0 \u03bc\u0302)\n\n(30)\n\nwhere \u03bd\u0302 is the diagonal matrix in the laboratory reference frame with diagonal\nelements\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u2212\u03c4l ; N open\n\u03bd\u0302N N = \uf8f4\n(31)\n\uf8f3 +\u03bd ; N closed\nN\nand \u03bc\u0302 is the diagonal matrix in the molecular reference frame with diagonal\nelements \u03bc\u039b .\nThen, defining\n\u00db = \u00db exp(2i\u03c0 \u03bc\u0302) \u00db t\nEquation (29) can be rewritten as\n\u0012\n\n\u0010\n\n\u00dboo + \u00dboc exp(\u22122i\u03c0\u03bd\u0302)cc \u2212 \u00dbcc\n\n\u0011\u22121\n\n(32)\n\n\u0013\n\n\u00dbco Bo (l) = exp(2i\u03c0\u03c4l )Bo (l)\n\n(33)\n\nThe matrix within the left large parenthesis no longer depends on \u03c4l ; it is\ndefined in open channels, and for each l has the same eigenvalue (eq. (11))\nand the same eigenvector (eqs. (14) and (22)) as the S matrix. We thus obtain\nthe expression\n\u0010\n\n\u015c = \u00dboo + \u00dboc exp(\u22122i\u03c0\u03bd\u0302)cc \u2212 \u00dbcc\nfor the S matrix.\n3.3\n\n\u0011\u22121\n\n\u00dbco\n\n(34)\n\nComputational advantages\n\nThe usual MQDT (sec. 3.1) uses the equation det S\u02c6 = 0 (eq. 16) which can be\nrewritten as a polynomial in tan(\u03c0\u03c4l ) whose degree equals the number of open\nchannels. Each root gives a well defined \u03c4 because, according to eq. (11), the\neigenphases of the \u015c matrix can take values between 0 and 1 (or -0.5 and 0.5)\nonly. Depending on the choice of the total energy there are the possibilities\nthat all channels are closed (there is then only one value of the set {A\u039b }) or\nopen. In the last case one obtains as obvious solutions the values \u03c4l = \u03bc\u039b (see\n(eq. 16). This shows that the \u03bc\u039b are exactly the usual collision phase shifts\nwhen the energy is high enough for all channels to be open. In the general case\nequation ( 16) is not solved by a diagonalization algorithm. The usual way to\nfind a solution is\n\u2022 All channels closed: No \u03c4l . All matrix elements depend on energy E through\nthe \u03bdN . One varies E and locates the zeros of the determinant by a root\nsearching algorithm.\n19\n\n\f\u2022 Some channels closed, some open. One fixes a given value of E and searches\nthe values of \u03c4l for which the determinant vanishes. The search may be done\nby computing the determinant and varying \u03c4l like in the preceding case, or\nby writing the polynomial in tan \u03c4l and computing its roots. In any case it\nis a root searching algorithm.\n\nAs explained in ref. [13], where illuminating figures are given, the practical\nproblem with such a standard approach is that when zeros are very close\nthe determinant crosses twice or more often the zero line at extremely close\nvalues, and nearly tangent to the zero line. This makes it very difficult to\navoid the missing of some pairs of zeroes. Moreover, in such a situation it is\nvery difficult to recover the wavefunctions individually as they switch between\nnearly orthogonal states for a very small change of E or \u03c4l . This situation\nis quite common in the case of a nearly integrable phase space, where there\nare systematic near degeneracies associated to the lack of level repulsion due\nto approximately conserved quantum numbers. The problem of missing levels\nbecomes particularly severe for the high values of angular momenta we use to\nstudy the semi classical limit.\n\nIn our QPM formulation (sec. 3.2) for bound systems the relevant practical\naspect [13] was that we could diagonalize the unitary matrix \u00ca t E\u02c6 by standard\ntechniques. Then the equation is solved by a search of zeros of the eigenphases,\nwhich move monotonously as a function of energy. Though it still requires a\nroot searching algorithm, it is much more efficient for near degenerate levels than the standard MQDT equation det \u015c = 0 and may be accelerated\nby linear interpolation. In the case of approximate double degeneracies, the\ndiagonalization algorithm always reliably provides a good pair of orthogonal\nwavefunctions.\n\nSimilarly in the ionized case the computation of the S matrix with eqs. (33,34)\nis reduced to a standard diagonalization of a complex symmetric matrix (for\nany real energy), with an auxiliary inversion of a matrix in the closed channel\nspace. The components of the resulting wave function on the open channels\n(Bo (l) \u2261 Tol ) are obtained by the diagonalization and the components on\nthe closed channels are then deduced with eq. (28). An other way to use this\nequation is to look for the zeros of the matrix to invert in the complex energy\nplane, which gives poles of the \u015c matrix. We will use both techniques in the\nnext sections.\n20\n\n\f4\n\nComparison between classical and quantum evolution on the surface of section\n\n4.1 Principles\n\nOne of the basic tools we use to study properties of our molecular system is to\ncompare the PM with Husimi [33] or Wigner [34] plots of eigenfunctions, as\nwell as the time evolution of such quantum distributions in phase space with\nthat of a swarm of classical trajectories. In such plots we represent the angular\npart of the wave function, ignoring its radial part. In other words we represent\nboth the classical and the quantum evolution on the surface of section, thus\nrelating the PM and the QPM.\nFirst we recall that we can perform the comparison of such objects in two\ndifferent frames, the molecular or Born-Oppenheimer frame and the laboratory frame. The molecular frame wave functions have coefficients labeled by\n\u039b, the laboratory frame wave functions have coefficients labeled by N. The\ncoefficients of a given wave function in those two reference frames are related\nby eq. (22). According to eq. (17) the matrix C\u02c6 which performs the transformation is composed of the matrix \u00db , which transforms between the molecular\nand the laboratory frames and of phase shifts in the two frames. We will explain the meaning of these phase shifts at the end of this section. Note that,\naccording to [35, eq. (A2.1)], the asymptotic value of \u00db for large angular momenta reduces to a rotation of \u03c0/2 around OY . \u00db thus basically performs a\nrotation between two orthogonal polar axis M\u0302 and N. We shall focus on four\nkey points in an electron orbit: perigee, apogee, and the two crossings of the\nsurface of the sphere of radius r0 , the border between the free motion and the\ncollision region. For hyperbolic motion the apogee does not exist. Wave functions for all these four points are naturally contained in the MQDT. Perigee\ncoefficients are the A\u039b introduced in eq. (6). They are naturally expressed in\nthe laboratory frame. In the case where all channels are bound, apogee coefficients are the components BN of the eigenvector |Bi of \u015c t introduced in\neqs. (21,22). They are naturally expressed in the laboratory frame, but may\nbe expressed in the molecular frame by multiplication with the matrix \u00db t . The\ncoefficients at the crossing of the sphere of radius r0 before and after collision\nare the angular parts of incoming \u03c6\u2212 (r) and outgoing \u03c6+ (r) in eq. (10). They\nare defined for unbound motion, but the basis for the validity of MQDT is that\nat r0 the inner part of the wave function is approximately the same for bound\nand unbound motion. So even for bound motion one can speak of \"infinitely\nfar from the core\" motion at r0 . This was a key point for the derivation of the\nclassical limit of MQDT in ref. [8]. The incoming and outgoing angular parts\nare naturally defined in the laboratory frame, but inserting eq. (9) into eq. (6)\nwe see that they are respectively ei\u03c0\u03bc\u0302 A\u039b and e\u2212i\u03c0\u03bc\u0302 A\u039b in the molecular frame.\n21\n\n\fThese considerations are clearly displayed by combining eqs. (24) and (30):\n0 = det(\u00ce \u2212 \u00ca t \u00ca)\ni\u03c0 \u03bc\u0302\n\n= det(\u00ce \u2212 e\n\n(35)\nt i\u03c0\u03bd\u0302\n\n\u00db e\n\ni\u03c0\u03bd\u0302\n\ne\n\ni\u03c0 \u03bc\u0302\n\n\u00dbe\n\n),\n\nAs written this is the determinant of a matrix in the molecular frame. It represents a QPM between perigee and perigee, and the associated eigenfunctions\nare the |A\u039b i. These are the angular part of the perigee wave function. They\ndepend on the energy E and (if there are open channels) on the phase shift\n\u03c4l which cause the determinant to vanish. The second line of this equation\nreads, from right to left: apply half a collision (ei\u03c0\u03bc\u0302 ), rotate the axis from OZ\nto OX by \u00db , apply half a free rotation (ei\u03c0\u03bd\u0302 ), you are at the apogee. Then\napply half a free rotation, rotate from OX to OZ, apply half a collision and\nyou are back to the perigee.\nOne may cyclically interchange the matrices in the product entering the determinant. Then eigenfunctions of the associated matrix are transformed accordingly. Moving the matrices step by step one place from left to right this\ngives first the QPM for the outgoing wave, |ei\u03c0\u03bc\u0302\u039b A\u039b i in the molecular frame,\nthen the same QPM in the laboratory frame, next the QPM between apogee\nand apogee in the laboratory frame etc. This provides the explanation for the\nphase shifts included in eq. (22): going from A\u039b to BN involves not only a\nchange of the basis, but also half a collision, and half a free rotation.\n4.2\n\nAll channels closed\n\nThat this is the correct interpretation is illustrated in Fig. 3, where we compare the time evolution of a (quantum mechanical) Husimi distribution and\na corresponding classical swarm of trajectories for a bound system. The parameters correspond to a mean energy for which Te /TN = 1/3, so that a\nfree rotation is 1/3 of a turn, and a strong coupling K = \u22123.98765 \u03c0 giving a\nstrong stretch around OZ, nearly \u00b1 two full turns at the \u00b1OZ poles (and zero\nat the equator). The remaining parameters are chosen as L = 40, J = 200,\n2B = 2.5 10\u221212 a.u.. The angular momenta are large as compared to those\naccessible in current molecular experiments, especially L which usually is limited to the range 0-2 in two step laser excitations. They correspond to semi\nclassical scaling of the experimental situation [6,7], as explained in section 2.3.\nThe quantum time evolution is computed by first obtaining a set of 2L + 1\nconsecutive eigenenergies Ei and the corresponding angular wave functions Ai\u039b\nfor increasing principal quantum number \u03bdJ by one (or a multiple of such sets\nto increase statistical accuracy of the results).

(d)-(f): Application of E\u02c6t . Half a\nstretch around OZ, \u00db t , half a rotation around OX.\n\nis then expanded in this eigenbasis. The time evolution results by applying\nexp(iEi t) to the Ai\u039b . Notice that it is applied only to the angular part, not to\nthe radial part of the wave functions. But for integer times, which correspond\nto a full orbit because we express energies in terms of a mean \u03bd, the radial\npart is the same, so the corresponding radial overlap is one. This procedure\nis consistent with the QPM point of view. What we neglect in doing so, is\nthe spreading with time of the radial wave packet. This is consistent with\na semi classical picture. For a full quantum computation we would need to\nchoose a radial distribution f (r) peaked around the corresponding radius r,\nperigee, apogee, r0 , and to develop this initial state, angular and radial part,\nin an eigenbasis. The initial quantum distribution is the Husimi distribution\nof a |LLi state. The corresponding\nq classical distribution is a circle around OZ\nwith radius given by cos \u03b8L = L/ L(L + 1). In Fig. 3 the top pair (a) equally\ncorresponds to incoming, perigee and outgoing waves because the collision is\na rotation around OZ and the distribution is rotationally invariant around\nthis axis. The next pair (b) is the apogee. Quantum mechanically we cannot\ncompute it from the previous distribution because we can compute only the\nevolution with an integral number of turns. It is thus obtained by a rotation\nof the initial distribution around OX by 1/6 of a turn. But then everything\nis computed from the four initial distributions by applying the above method.\n23\n\n\fOne sees perfectly the evolution: 1/6 of a turn around OX (c), half stretch\naround OZ (d), half stretch along OZ (e), 1/6 of a turn around OX (f) etc.\nThe quantum distribution follows perfectly the classical one in such short\ntimes. For longer times they begin to differ due to the finite value of ~.\n\n4.3 First Channel Open\n\nX\n\nY\n\nFig. 4. First channel opening. Classical PM. Since Poincar\u00e9 maps have a symmetry\nC2 around OX, only half the sphere is needed. We use a stereographic projection\nfrom +OZ of the lower part of the sphere. The open part is a small cap near the\n+OX axis. Large black squares at its border are ionizing trajectories.\n\nTo begin with, we select an energy just above the first threshold. As for the\nrest of this section we select L = 50, J = 100, 2B = 10\u221210 a.u., so N varies\nbetween 50 and 150. As compared to the bound case, the ratio L/J has been\nincreased from 1/5 to 1/2 to increase the transfer of energy between electron\nand core. The PM is given in Fig. 4. The ionization region corresponds to a\nvery small white cap around the +OX axis. The large black squares at its\nborder are the points of ionization of some trajectories.\nThe value of the phase shift \u03c4 of the S matrix as a function of energy is shown\nin Fig. 5: for each energy there is only one open channel, thus one value of \u03c4 .\nThe Husimi plot of the wave function at the first channel opening (see Fig. 6(a))\nis located in the open part of the sphere. Resonances for nearly bound states\nappear as increments of \u03c4 by one. The widths of the resonances vary widely.\nThe physical reason for this is easily displayed by Husimi plots for the resonances observed in Fig. 5. The very broad resonance which spans all of Fig. 5\nis seen to be localized in the chaotic region, overlapping widely with the open\npart of the sphere: Fig. 6(b). We see three other resonances of decreasing\n24\n\n\f1.0\n\n0.8\n\n\u03c4\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n-8726\n\n-8724\n\n-8722\n\n-8720\n\n-8718\n\n10\n\n-10\n\nenergy\n\nFig. 5.

It appears at the first ionization threshold, which is negative (\u22128726 10\u221210 ), simulating a stray space charge: see text.\nThere is only one phase shift \u03c4 , because there is only one channel open, in this energy range. It increases by one for resonances between the open channel and some\nclosed channels. Coupling \u03bc50 = 4.\n\nwidth, which are also localized in the chaotic sea, but farther from the open\npart, as shown in Fig. 6(c)-(e). Note that these resonances live on the border\nof an integrable island, and are thus of similar type as states computed in\nref. [36]. The state 6(f) is even narrower as it lives on or around an integrable\nisland within this chaotic zone. It is seen as a one point glitch in Fig. 5. In\naddition there are much narrower resonances which cannot be found easily\nby the previous method. They are localized on or beyond the large regular\nregion in the middle of the sphere, and have exceedingly small width, due to\nan exponentially small overlap of the Husimi function with the open part of\nthe sphere.\nUsing the traditional method which looks for a zero value of a determinant we\nhave been able to locate them by the following trick. We can set artificially\na lower than zero threshold for ionization both in classical and in quantum\nmechanics: this would correspond to the existence of a long range screening\npotential, which might be due to stray electric fields or a space charge. In\nthe classical simulation, this corresponds to considering an electron which\nafter collision has an electronic energy higher than a given negative threshold\nEthresh as ionized and not returning. In quantum mechanics, since the only\ndifference between open and closed channels is the replacement of \u03bdN by \u2212\u03c4 ,\nthis corresponds to performing this replacement for a finite value of \u03bdN , which\ncorresponds to this Ethresh . We have selected such a case: see the negative\nenergy for opening of the first channel in Fig. 5. If we do not apply this trick,\nthe whole sphere is closed for the same value of the parameters.

(c)-(e) three narrow resonances seen in this figure (in order\nof decreasing widthes) at \u22128.71991 10\u22127 a.u. (width 1.11 10\u221212 a.u.), \u22128.72156 10\u22127\na.u.

(f) the narrowest resonance\nseen in this figure, as only a one point glitch at \u22128.71780 10\u22127 a.u. (width 2.67 10\u221215\na.u.): located on a regular island with some overlap with the chaotic sea. (g)-(h)\nextremely narrow resonances located in the regular regions: their widths are 2 10\u221221\nand 1.5 10\u221229 a.u.. (i) an extremely narrow resonance located in the second chaotic\nsea between them. Its width is 1 10\u221227 , intermediate between the two previous ones,\nbecause it is separated from the open part by a regular region.\n\nuse MQDT for closed channels to compute energies and eigenfunctions of all\nchannels. We select by inspection the wave functions quantized in the regular\nregions and run the open channel MQDT with a very small step to locate the\nresonances. Thus, we have been able to locate resonances of widths 2 10\u221221 and\n1.5 10\u221229 a.u. located respectively in the regular regions near the equator and\nthe bottom of the sphere, and also a resonance of intermediate width 1 10\u221227\nlocated in the second chaotic sea between these two regular regions. In any case\nwe have checked that the Husimi plots for the closed level and the resonance\n26\n\n\fare essentially equal, which provides a good check of our interpretation.\nBut this situation is quite unsatisfactory in the general case of truly positive energy, where we cannot use this trick to locate such narrow resonances.\nFortunately the method of locating the poles of the \u015c matrix in the complex\nplane indicated at the end of section 3 is much more powerful. We can use\nthe contour integration to locate the resonances by dichotomy in the complex\nplane, and finally use a root searching algorithm to compute them accurately\nonce they have been approximately located. To check this method we have\ndetermined for example that the resonance at \u22128.71991 10\u22127 a.u. (Figs. 5 and\n6(c)) corresponds to a pole at complex energy value 1.11 10\u221212 a.u., consistent\nwith the previous method, and that the resonance at \u22128.71780 10\u22127, seen as\na one point glitch in Fig. 5 corresponds to a pole at complex energy value of\n2.67 10\u221215 a.u. (Fig. 6(f)).\n\n4.4 Many Open Channels\nWe now increase the total energy to \u223c 4.50 10\u22127 a.u., such that slightly more\nthan a half of the sphere is open. Ionization occurs in a cap around OX with\ncos \u03b1 & \u22120.1. We select two values of the coupling, a weak \u03bc50 = 0.4 and a\nstrong \u03bc50 = 9.81. The remaining parameters are chosen as L = 50, J = 100,\n2B = 10\u221210 a.u. as before.\n\n4.4.1 Weak coupling\nX\n\n(a)\n\nX\n\n(b)\n\nY\n\nY\n\nFig. 7. Weak coupling. (a) Ordinary Poincar\u00e9 Map. Iteration stops when the electron\nionizes (black squares) (b) Combined Poincar\u00e9 Jung map. When the electron ionizes\niteration is continued with the Jung recipe (Fig. 1(b)). It follows circles on the open\npart of the sphere until it enters back into the closed part.\n\nFig. 7(a) displays the ordinary PM. Iteration stops when the electron ionizes\n(black squares) and a new trajectory is launched in the closed part of the\n27\n\n\fsphere. Fig. 7(b) shows the combined PM+JSM. Except for the regular islands\nnear the \u2212OX axis, it was obtained by running a single trajectory, i.e. using\nthe PM for negative electron energies, and the JSM for positive energies. When\nthe system is in the bound chaotic part it diffuses slowly towards the back\nor the front of the sphere. This diffusion mechanism was studied carefully in\nref. [21]. When it ionizes, the JSM generates a set of one bounce events, tracing\na semi circle around OZ in the open region, until it enters the bound region\nat the end of the semi circle and starts anew to diffuse. Due to the small value\nof \u03bc the number of steps needed to complete the semi circle is very large. The\ntrajectory thus behaves like one injected very close to a parabolic manifold.\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n\u03c4\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n45000\n\n45001\n\n45002\n\n45003\n\n45004\n\n10\n\n-11\n\nenergy\n\nFig. 8. Phase shifts. Weak coupling \u03bc50 = 0.4\n\nQuantum mechanically Fig. 8 displays the phase shifts for the eigenchannels.\nThere are 23 channels open at this energy. We readily see that it displays a\nset of resonances.\nSome Husimi plots of the eigenfunctions of the open channels are displayed in\nFig. 9(a-c). They follow closely the trajectories of the JSM. In a previous letter\nwe noted [15], that parabolic manifolds in a JSM may lead to eigenstates of\nthe S matrix localized near this manifold (see also below). As we mentioned\nabove the semicircles behave quite similarly, and as we do find states localized near these semi circles this again proves the applicability of the JSM to\nthe description of the ionizing part of the spectrum in a semiclassical limit.\nFig. 9(d) displays the Husimi plot of the first resonance seen in Fig. 8. It\nis quantized along the border of the regions of bound and unbound motion,\nyielding a large overlap with the open part resulting in a large width of the\nresonance. All resonances seen in Fig. 8 have similar Husimi plots. Functions\nlying further from the open channels would again correspond to extremely\nnarrow resonances, which cannot easily be seen in the eigenphases with the\n28\n\n\fX\n\n(a)\n\nX\n\n(b)\n\nY\n\nY\n\nX\n\n(c)\n\nX\n\n(d)\n\nY\n\nY\n\nFig. 9.

Fig. 10(a) shows the combined PM + JSM. Except for the fixed\npoints described below all points of this combined PM + JSM pertain to a\nsingle trajectory. Due to the large value of the coupling this trajectory jumps\nrandomly in and out of the bounded part within a few steps. The combined\nmap is chaotic everywhere in this part. Fig. 11 displays the phase shifts. One\nsees a lot of avoided crossings between the phase curves, signaling a chaotic\nsituation. A typical Husimi plot of an arbitrary wave function is shown in\nFig. 10(b).\nThe important fixed points of this map (apart from isolated unstable fixed\npoints embedded in the chaotic sea) are\n(i) the \u2212OX axis in the bound part (PM) surrounded by a very small island\nof stability, too small with the present value of ~ to capture a single\nquantum state.\n(ii) the \u00b1OZ axis in the open part surrounded by a larger regular island of\nthe JSM. These are fixed points because the collision induces a rotation\naround OZ, entirely embedded in the open part (JSM).\n29\n\n\fZ\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n(a)\nX\n\nY\n\n(b)\nY\n\nZ\n\nX\n\nX\n\nY\n\nZ\n\n(c)\nY\n\nX\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nX\n\nY\n\n(d)\nY\n\nX\n\nX\n\nY\n\nY\n\nX\n\nFig. 10.

(a) Classical map. Small dots: PM,\nlarger dots: JSM. The open part is slightly larger than half a sphere. The PM has\nonly a very small island of stability at the back, too small to capture a quantum\nstate with this value of ~. The JSM has two regular islands around \u00b1OZ, and the\nparabolic manifold of fixed points on the equatorial plane. All the remaining points\nlie in a single chaotic sea obtained with only one starting point, iterated by the PM\nwhen bound, and by the JSM when ionized.

Eigenphases as a function of energy. Strong coupling \u03bc50 = 9.81\n\n(iii) all points in the equatorial plane in the open part (JSM). An electron\nentering the collision region with \u03b8L = \u03c0/2 and arbitrary \u03c6L , up to the\nrestriction that the electron energy should be positive, will emerge from\nthe collision region with the same angular momentum direction because\n30\n\n\fthe increment \u03b4\u03c6L = K cos \u03b8L equals zero. We thus have a parabolic\nmanifold of fixed points.\n(iv) if |K| is chosen larger than n * 2\u03c0, that is \u03bcL > nL\nwe would also find\n2\nlines mapped onto themselves at angles \u03b8L corresponding to K cos \u03b8L =\n0, \u00b12\u03c0, * * * , \u00b1n * 2\u03c0\nIn particular the parabolic manifold is embedded in the chaotic sea. A nearly\nhorizontal curve may be observed in the middle of Fig. 11. It corresponds to\nthe fixed points of this parabolic manifold in the equatorial plane as shown\nby Fig. 10(c)(see also ref. [15]). For e.g. the stadium billiard, such manifolds\nof fixed points embedded in a chaotic sea have significant quantum effects.\nThere they give rise to the so called bouncing ball states which in turn lead\nto deviations of the spectral fluctuation properties in the eigenvalue spectrum\nfrom the random matrix results [37]. We expect similar quantum effects of\nthe parabolic manifolds on statistical properties of the eigenphases of the\nscattering matrix. When considering eigenphases of the scattering matrix as\na function of the energy E or the coupling strength \u03bcL , we find eigenphases\nwhich merely change. The other fixed point near the \u00b1OZ poles, surrounded\nby a significant island of stability in the JSM, is less conspicuous in Fig. 11.\nIt corresponds to a horizontal line near \u03c4 = \u22120.3, barely visible due to strong\navoided crossings. It nevertheless traps a quantum state as seen in Fig. 10(d).\n\n5\n\n5.1\n\nComparison between semi-classical and quantum evolution on\nthe surface of section\n\nPrinciple\n\nWe want to compare our results with the original work of Bogomolny [9,10,11],\nwhich was based on the semi-classical formula\n\u2032\n\nT (\u03c6, \u03c6 ) =\n\nX\n\ncl.tr.\n\ns\n\n\u2202 2 S(\u03c6, \u03c6\u2032 )/\u2202\u03c6\u2202\u03c6\u2032\ni\nexp\nS(\u03c6, \u03c6\u2032) ,\n\u22122\u03c0i~\n~\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(36)\n\nwhere, as in the remainder of this section, we use the notations of the review\npaper of W.H. Miller [38]. In particular the i and the signs in the argument of\nthe square root function take care of the Maslov index.\nWe first notice that the simple minded way of using this equation, computing\nR\nS = pdq using the formulae obtained in the previous classical part of this\npaper and the previous ones does not work, because our \"classical\" molecular\nreference frame is a moving frame, implying that LZC is not conjugate to \u03c6C\nL.\nIndeed consider first the collision step. The change of orientation of L in this\n31\n\n\fframe entails, by conservation of angular momentum, a change of the orientation of N, and thus of the orientation of this frame, by an angle called \u03b4\u03c6\u2032L\nin section 2 and \u03c6Q\nN in Appendix A.1. This extra rotation of the frame implies that LZC is no longer the generator of rotations of \u03c6C\nL around the OZC\naxis. For the collision step this problem can be solved by using the \"quantum\" molecular reference frame, which is fixed, since the collision is taken\nas instantaneous, and that this frame is obtained from the laboratory frame\nby a rotation with fixed Euler angles \u03c6M , \u03b8M , 0 (see Appendix A). That this\nanalysis is correct is shown by noting that the transformation produced by the\nQ\ncollision in the \"quantum\" reference frame \u03b4\u03c6Q\nL = K cos \u03b8L is canonical (the\nexterior differential product dLZQ \u2227d\u03c6Q\nL is conserved), while the corresponding\nfor the \"classical\" frame quantities is not. Moreover the transformation from\nthe \"quantum\" to the \"classical\" molecular reference frame is not canonical as\nshown in Appendix A.1, where we have computed the momentum conjugate to\n\u03c6C\nL , such that this transformation becomes canonical (eq. A.7). Nevertheless,\nsince our goal is physical evidence we prefer to stick to our previous practice of\nusing LZC , \u03c6C\nL . The only drawback of using non canonical coordinates is that\nthe map is not area preserving on the sphere, a minor effect for L/J = 1/5 or\n1/2 as chosen in this paper.\nFor the collision step we thus can solve this problem by using the \"quantum\"\nmolecular frame, but the problem reappears for the Coulomb step, where this\nframe is also moving. We could compute everything in the laboratory frame,\nbut it is more meaningful to use the \"quantum\" molecular frame for the collision step, the laboratory frame for the Coulomb step, and two semiclassical\nformulae for the change between these coordinate frames. This procedure follows closely the purely quantum formulation, giving a semiclassical approximation for each of the steps which enter in the discussion of section 3, as\nshown in Table 1. It provides direct evidence that MQDT indeed is the exact\nquantization of the Bogomolny formulation, in particular that eqs. (26, 35) are\nthe exact counterpart of the semi classical eq. (1.20) of ref. [10], remembering\nthat E\u02c6 describes half a turn, while T describes a full turn.\nAs Poincar\u00e9 section we select in coordinate space the intersection at radius\nr0 with outgoing trajectories, i.e. an \"after collision\" Poincar\u00e9 map. We thus\nwrite:\nT = U c U QL U f U LQ\n\n(37)\n\nwhere from right to left the U i 's indicate the unitary semiclassical operators\nfor the transformation from the \"quantum\" molecular reference frame to the\nlaboratory frame, free motion in the laboratory frame, back to the \"quantum\"\nmolecular frame and collision in the \"quantum\" frame. All these operators are\nbuilt with F2 / F3 kind of generating functions, i.e. they are of the form\n32\n\n\f(U\u03c8)(\u03c6) =\n\nZZ\n\ns\n\n\u2202 2 F3 (I \u2032 , \u03c6)/\u2202I \u2032 \u2202\u03c6\ni\nexp\n(F3 (I \u2032 , \u03c6))\n2\u03c0i~\n~\ns\n\u22121\ni\n\u00d7\nexp(\u2212 I \u2032 \u03c6\u2032 )\n2\u03c0i~\n~\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u00d7 \u03c8(\u03c6 ) dI d\u03c6\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(38)\n\nwhere I \u2032 is the momentum conjugate to the coordinate \u03c6\u2032 and the resulting\nintegral is evaluated with the stationary phase approximation. This generating function is of type F3 as it is a function of the old momentum I \u2032 and\nthe new coordinate \u03c6. An auxiliary Fourier transform is used to go from old\ncoordinate \u03c6\u2032 to old momentum I \u2032 . Evaluating the inner dI \u2032 integral by the\nstationary phase approximation amounts to computing an F1 type generating\nfunction, and inverting the order of the Fourier transform and of the F integral\namounts to defining an F2 generating function. Note that we have defined by\nthis double integral a U operator which goes from coordinate \u03c6\u2032 to coordinate\n\u03c6 representation, while the F3 integral on its own gives an operator from the\nold momentum I \u2032 to the new coordinate \u03c6. Hence, we can compute eq. (37) by\nperforming four integrations instead of eight by alternating between the coordinate and the momentum representations. We can compute with the same\nprocedure a momentum coordinate T\u039b\u039b\u2032 matrix by simply introducing two\nFourier Transforms to the left and the right of the operator T . As momenta\nare quantized T\u039b\u039b\u2032 depends on discrete variables, while T (\u03c6, \u03c6\u2032) is a function\nof continuous arguments If there are no singularities all these possibilities give\nthe same result. We shall use them freely in order to obtain generating functions which we can compute analytically and we shall see in section 5.3 that\nthis choice offers possibilities to circumvent singularity problems.\n5.2\n\nComputations\n\nFirst notice that the conjugate pair of coordinates in the \"quantum\" molecular\nframe is the known {LZQ , \u03c6Q\nL } pair. The momentum in the laboratory frame\nis the modulus N of N. Intuitively the conjugate angle is the angle \u03c6N of\nrotation of the core axis M\u0302 around N, referred to a reference axis which only\ncan be J. Explicit formulae for computing the transformation are given in\nAppendix A.2, where we also show that the transformation from {LZQ , \u03c6Q\nL } to\n{N, \u03c6N } is indeed canonical, justifying our intuition concerning the definition\nof \u03c6N .\nThe computation of the F3 generating functions for the collision and the free\nrotation steps follows the same scheme. In both cases the momentum is conserved, while the angle is increased by an amount which is a function of the\ncorresponding momentum I only \u03b4\u03c6 = f (I), respectively \u03b4\u03c6Q\nL = KLZQ and\n\u03b4\u03c6N = \u2212\u03b4\u03b2 = +2\u03c0Te /TN (the free rotation is direct in the laboratory frame\n33\n\n\fand seen with inverse orientation in the \"classical\" molecular frame), which is\na function of N only for a given total energy E. Using the equations defining\nF3 (I \u2032 , \u03c6), namely \u03c6\u2032 = \u2202F3 /\u2202I \u2032 and I = \u2202F3 /\u2202\u03c6 we obtain\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\n\u2032\n\nF3 (I , \u03c6) = \u03c6I \u2212\n\nf (I \u2032 )dI \u2032\n\n(39)\n\ni.e. using [8, eqs. (A11,A12)]:\n\nQ\n\u2032\nF3 (L\u2032ZQ , \u03c6Q\nL ) = LZQ \u03c6L\n\n\u2212K\n\nL\u2032ZQ 2\n2L\n\n= L\u2032ZQ \u03c6Q\nL + 2\u03c0\u03bcL\u2032Z\n\nQ\n\nF3 (N \u2032 , \u03c6N ) = N \u2032 \u03c6N + 2\u03c0\u03bdN \u2032\n\n(40)\n\nThe computation of the F2 or F3 (LZQ , \u03c6N ) is more tricky. First, whether it is\na F2 or F3 generating function depends on which is the original and the new\nframe, and we need both transformations. To go in the opposite direction we\nuse the unitarity of the operator U. We start with the following formula which\nexpresses N as a function of the independent variables:\nN=\n\nq\n\nJ 2 \u2212 (LZQ / sin \u03c6N )2 \u00b1\n\nq\n\nL2 \u2212 (LZQ / sin \u03c6N )2\n\n(41)\n\nThis formula can be computed analytically by eliminating \u03c6Q\nL between eqs. (A.11)\nand (A.15) and using eq. (A.13). It is more satisfying to notice that a little\ngeometrical thinking on Fig. 2(b) shows that it results from projecting the J\nand L sides of the triangle given by the relation J = L + N onto the N side,\nbecause the common height is equal to |LZQ / sin \u03c6N |. By integration over \u03c6N\nwe obtain\n\u0010\n\nF2 (LZQ , \u03c6N ) = LZQ ArcXY\n\n\u0010q\n\n\u0010\n\nJ 2 \u2212 (LZQ / sin \u03c6N )2 , LZQ cot \u03c6N\nq\n\n\u0011\n\n+J ArcXY J cos \u03c6N , J 2 \u2212 (LZQ / sin \u03c6N )2 sin \u03c6N\n\n\u0010\n\n\u00b1 LZQ ArcXY\n\n\u0010q\n\n\u0010\n\nL2 \u2212 (LZQ / sin \u03c6N )2 , LZQ cot \u03c6N\n\n+L ArcXY L cos \u03c6N ,\n\nq\n\n\u0011\n\nL2 \u2212 (LZQ / sin \u03c6N )2 sin \u03c6N\n\n(42)\n\u0011\u0011\n\u0011\u0011\n\nwhere ArcXY is an unambiguous notation for the angle of a vector whose\nprojections on the X- and Y -axes are known (the order of parameters for the\nanalogous atan2 used in some programming languages is not fixed).\nNotice that the derivative of F2 with respect to LZQ , which must give \u03c6Q\nL,\nequals the sum of the coefficients of LZQ in the first and third terms of eq. (42)\n(this also has a geometrical interpretation). This shows that the sum of these\nterms is precisely equal to \u03c6Q\nL LZQ . Using this result we can solve the problem\n34\n\n\fof the integration constant depending on LZQ , which appears in the integration\nover \u03c6N . We follow continuously the various angles over ranges greater than 2\u03c0\nduring the computations in order to compute the exact values of the various\nArcXY.\nNext we compute the actions S(\u03c6, \u03c6\u2032 ) and S(\u039b, \u039b\u2032). We start from a pair of\n\u2032\nconjugate {L\u2032ZQ , \u03c6Q\nL }, i.e. a point on the Poincar\u00e9 sphere, and compute ana\u2032\n\nQ\nQ\nlytically the final LZQ , \u03c6Q\nL as a function of these. To compute, say S(\u03c6L , \u03c6L ),\nQ\u2032\n\u2032\nwe first invert numerically the relation between \u03c6Q\nL and LZQ for fixed \u03c6L .\nUsually, there are several solutions. For each solution we then compute S as a\n\u2032\n\u2032\nfunction of \u03c6Q\nL and LZQ by adding the various Fn generating functions which\nenter in the exponentials of the U operators which are used to build T .\n\nWe do not need to evaluate all intermediate integrals by stationary phase to\nobtain the amplitudes. Indeed, it was shown in ref. [38] that the formula for\nthe amplitude given in eq.(36) is a direct consequence of the action being a F1\ngenerating function of a canonical transformation between the initial and the\nfinal states. We thus only need to compute the second derivative of S with reQ\u2032\nspect to \u03c6Q\nL and \u03c6L . For this we use the derivatives of S with respect to initial\n\u2032\nvariables L\u2032ZQ and \u03c6Q\nL , that we have computed analytically by following the\nvarious steps, and general calculus formulae for second derivatives of inverse\nfunctions. We have checked that these amplitudes obey the relationship,\n\u2202\n\n\u2032\nQ\nS(\u03c6Q\nL , \u03c6L )\n\u2032\nQ\n\u2202\u03c6Q\nL \u2202\u03c6L\n\n2\n\n=\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u2202\u03c6Q\nL \uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\u2032\n\u2202LZQ\n\n\u22121\n\n(43)\n\u2032\n\u03c6Q\nL\n\nwhich was shown in ref. [38, eq. (2.54b)] to be a simple consequence of the\nconservation of probability. This is a very useful test of our way to compute\nS since the second term of this equation does not depend on S.\n\n5.3\n\nSingularities in the semi classical computations\n\nWe then use the resulting T (\u03c6, \u03c6\u2032) and T (\u039b, \u039b\u2032) to compute the evolution of\nwave packets as was done in section 4.2. The first problem which appears is\nthe existence of divergences of the amplitudes. Fig. 12 plots the amplitudes\nof T as a function of the initial position on the Poincar\u00e9 sphere, which was\nused as a first step to compute them. The black lines of maxima are actually\ndivergences. They are at different positions for the two representations.\nThe physical meaning of these divergences is the existence of focus singularities. We discuss the \u03c6 representation first, by referring to Fig. 13(a).

(a) T (\u03c6, \u03c6\u2032 ). (b) T (\u039b, \u039b\u2032 ). The\npart of a straight line going through the OZ pole in the lower left of the sphere is\nthe input corresponding to Fig. 13(b): the fact that it is slightly distorted is due\nto plotting in the \"classical\" reference frame instead of the \"quantum\" reference\nframe.\n\nrefocus at the same point (on the map). On the sphere the coordinate is \u03c6\u2032\nand the momentum is L\u2032Z . The points aligned on the straight line in the lower\nleft part of Fig. 12(a) and (b), have the same value of \u03c6\u2032 and a varying L\u2032Z .\nThey thus constitute a fan of initial trajectories. The image of this line is given\nin Fig. 13(b). The focus is caused by the folding part of this image, precisely\nthe point where it is tangent to a radius from the OZ pole: same position\n\u03c6 independent to first order of the initial momentum L\u2032Z . The divergence of\nthe amplitude is a consequence of the presence of the term \u2202\u03c6/\u2202L\u2032Z |\u03c6\u2032 in the\ndenominator of the second part of eq. (43).\nX\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nY\n\nFig. 13. Focus singularities. (a) represents such a singularity in an ordinary (flat)\ncoordinate space. (b) plots the image of the straight oblique line in the lower left\npart of Fig. 12 (a) and (b) which cross the singularity line in the T (\u03c6, \u03c6\u2032 ) representation. All starting points on this segment have the same coordinate \u03c6\u2032 , but different\nmomenta L\u2032Z , i.e. they are equivalent to the starting points in (a). The back folding\nof the image in (b), common especially to chaotic situations, is the cause of the\nfocus singularity: see text.\n\nThe problem of singularities is common in any semi classical analysis. Their\nsolution, usually called \"regularization\" follow two main routes. The first, common in physics textbooks, is to revert to a full quantum computation near the\nsingular point, and to match the results with the semi classical computation\ndistant from it. Notice that the MQDT analysis is such a fully quantum so36\n\n\flution. The second, common in some mathematical works, is to notice that\nwe can circumvent the problem by changing from coordinate to momentum\nrepresentation through a Fourier transform. The singularity is a result of a\nprojection from phase space onto coordinate space; there are no singularties\nin phase space itself. The back bending in Fig. 13(b) which is tangent to a\nmeridian of the sphere is not tangent, at this point, to a parallel. The starting\npoints in Fig. 12 which project onto the same \u03c6\u2032 project to different L\u2032Z . The\nlines of singularities exist in both representations in Fig. 12, but they appear\nat different points. So one can compute the points of the map by different\nroutes, a possibility rooted on the possible choice at each U step in the computation of T (eq. (37)) to select the \u03c6 or LZ representation, both in the initial\nand the final state. The only remaining problem is the fact that both lines of\nsingularities share the \u00b1OZ poles. To solve it we would have to use a more\ngeneral change of canonical coordinates on the sphere, a rotation which can\nchange the position of the poles. We do not attempt to do this in the present\npaper.\n\nStart\n\nClass.\n\nMQDT\n\nT (\u03c6, \u03c6\u2032 )\n\nT (\u039b, \u039b\u2032)\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\nX\n\nY\n\nY\n\nFig. 14.

Second row:\nstarting in a point with a \u03c6 focus singularity, at the intersection of the circle with\nthe straight line in the lower left part of Fig. 12(a) and (b) and the singularity line\nin the \u03c6 representation.\n\nIllustration of this is given in Fig. 14. The starting point in the first row is\nselected to correspond to no singularity in any of the two representations. All\ncomputations, classical, quantum and semi classical in both representations\nagree nicely. In the second row the starting point lies on the singular line in the\n\u03c6 representation, but on a regular point in the \u039b representation. The result\nof the T (\u03c6, \u03c6\u2032) computation is highly distorted, while that of the T (\u039b, \u039b\u2032)\ncomputation agree nicely with classical and MQDT computations.\n37\n\n\f6\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have formulated the multichannel quantum defect theory for Rydberg\nmolecules as the quantization of a classical symplectic map composed of a\nstandard surface of section for negative electron energies and a Jung scattering map for positive ones. This formulation elucidates MQDT from an entirely\ndifferent point of view. Simultaneously we have shown it to provide considerable computational advantages.\nThe method was applied in the context of a simplified model, where only one\nrotational degree of freedom for the molecule was taken into account. Simultaneously, the absolute value of the electron angular momentum was fixed. This\napproximation allows for a two dimensional surface of section, and simplified\ncalculations, but is not essential to the representation of MQDT as a quantum\nPoincar\u00e9 map. These applications demonstrate the simplifications achieved.\nFinally we establish the relation to Bogomolny's [9,10,11] semi classical formulation of the quantum Poincar\u00e9 map. Considering caustics we can clearly\nsee the basic difference between the exact and the semi-classical map.\n\nA\n\nReference Frames\n\nWe use three reference frames, the laboratory reference frame Oxyz, and\ntwo molecular reference frames, called \"Classical\" OXC YC ZC and \"Quantum\"\nOXQ YQ ZQ molecular reference frames.\nIn purely classical computations the \"Classical\" right handed molecular reference frame is defined in such a way that OZC lies along the inter nuclear axis\nM\u0302 of the molecular ionic core, and OXC lies along its angular momentum N.\nThis is adequate because the two steps of the dynamics, namely the collision\nand the free rotation, are rotations about theses itwo axes. We always use it to\ndisplay our results, as the physical content is most obvious within this frame.\nHowever, this is not the molecular reference frame selected in usual definitions\nof quantum wave functions. There the molecular frame OXQ YQ ZQ is defined\nas the one deduced from the laboratory frame Oxyz by a rotation of three\nEuler angles (with the conventions of [18]). The first two are well defined,\nnamely \u03c6M , \u03b8M , the polar angles of M\u0302. The third is arbitrary for a diatomic\nmolecule, since it corresponds to a rotation around the molecular axis. It is\ngiven an arbitrary value 0 or \u03c0/2, depending on authors; we will select 0 as in\n[2].\nBoth reference frames share the same OZ = M\u0302 axis, but have different OX\n38\n\n\faxes. The classical OXC = N axis is not well defined in quantum mechanics,\nsince N is a momentum conjugate to the angles \u03c6M , and \u03b8M , which are the\nvariables defining the rotational molecular wave function in eqs. (2\u20133). Thus\nthe classical reference frame defines the usual quantum wave functions only\nin the semi classical limit. But conversely, the quantum reference frame is\nalso well defined in classical mechanics. So, if we want to compare classical\nand quantum results, we do the quantum calculations in the usual quantum\nreference frame, and then plot the resulting Wigner or Husimi distributions\nin the classical reference frame, by applying the well defined classical rotation\nwhich brings the quantum reference frame onto the classical one.\nWe shall now compute the formulae which connect these three frames. They\nare based on the fact that we can compute the position of J and N in\nOXQ YQ ZQ once we know the position of L in this frame, using simple geometrical relations: see Fig. 2(b). We first need to define precisely the laboratory\nreference frame. Since everything is invariant with respect to a rotation of\nthe whole space, we may choose the Oz axis along J (Fig. 2(a)). Quantum\nmechanically this amounts to studying the |J, MJ i = |J, Ji state. Conversely,\nonce we know the position of J in the molecular frame, we know the position\nof the Oz axis of the laboratory frame in OXQ YQ ZQ , but there is no way\nto locate the Ox and the Oy in this molecular frame. This is a consequence\nof the rotational invariance of the problem. The corresponding angle \u03c6M is\nconjugate to Jz , and is one of the variables we have eliminated when reducing\nthe dimension of phase space from 10 to 4 (or 6 if L is not kept constant).\nThe position of J in OXQ YQ ZQ is a simple consequence of our choice of 0 as\nthe third Euler angle of the rotation which brings the laboratory frame Oxyz\nonto the \"Quantum\" molecular reference frame OXQ YQ ZQ . These three Euler\nangles are \u03c6M , \u03b8M , and 0. The first Euler rotation of the angle \u03c6M keeps J =\nOz fixed and brings Oy onto OYQ. The second Euler rotation around OYQ by\nan angle \u03b8M brings Oz onto OZQ . Conversely the position of J in the molecular\nframe is obtained by a rotation of \u2212\u03b8M around OYQ. It is thus located in the\nOXQ ZQ plane with coordinates JXQ = \u2212J sin \u03b8M , JYQ = 0, JZQ = J cos \u03b8M ,\nalways directed towards negative OXQ since 0 \u2264 \u03b8M \u2264 \u03c0.\n\nA.1\n\nTransformations between \"Classical\" and \"Quantum\" molecular frames\n\nLet us compute N in OXQ YQ ZQ . For a diatomic molecule, the momentum\nN is perpendicular to the inter nuclear axis M\u0302, since the moment of inertia\naround the inter nuclear axis is zero. Thus N is in the OXQ YQ plane. We then\nwrite N = J \u2212 L in this frame\n39\n\n\fNXQ = \u2212J sin \u03b8M \u2212L sin \u03b8LQ cos \u03c6Q\nL\nNYQ =\n\n\u2212L sin \u03b8LQ sin \u03c6Q\nL\n\n0\n\n(A.1)\n\nNZQ = J cos \u03b8M \u2212L cos \u03b8LQ\nNZQ = 0 leads to\nL\ncos \u03b8Q\nJq L\nsin \u03b8M = + 1 \u2212 cos2 \u03b8M ,\n\ncos \u03b8M =\n\n(A.2)\n\nbecause 0 \u2264 \u03b8M \u2264 \u03c0. This gives the position of J once L is known in\nOXQ YQ ZQ . Then N lies in the plane OXQYQ at an angle\n\u0010\n\n\u03c6Q\nN = ArcXY NXQ , NYQ\n\u0012 q\n\n\u0011\n\n(A.3)\n\nQ\nQ\n= ArcXY \u2212 J 2 \u2212 L2 cos2 \u03b8LQ \u2212 L sin \u03b8LQ cos \u03c6Q\nL , \u2212L sin \u03b8L sin \u03c6L\n\n\u0013\n\nwhere we have used eqs. (A.1) and (A.2), and where ArcXY is defined after\neq. (42).\nThus the \"quantum\" molecular reference frame angles for L are related to\ntheir corresponding \"classical\" reference frame value via:\n\u03b8LC = \u03b8LQ\n\u03c6C\nL\n\n= \u03c6Q\nL\n\n(A.4)\n\u2212\n\n\u03c6Q\nN\n\nThe reverse is not obtained by simply inverting this relation. We rather express\nthe relation J = N + L in the \"classical\" reference frame, where we know that\nN is along OXC .\nJXC = N +L sin \u03b8LC cos \u03c6C\nL\nC\nC\nJYC = +L sin \u03b8L sin \u03c6L\nJZC = +L cos \u03b8LC\n\n(A.5)\n\nSince the OZ axis is common in the \"quantum\" and \"classical\" molecular\nreference frames, relations A.2 are conserved with \u03b8LQ replaced by \u03b8LC . Then\nwe recall that in the OXQ YQ ZQ reference frame the projection of J into the\nOXQ YQ plane, which is identical with the OXC YC plane, is always directed\n40\n\n\falong the negative OXQ axis, which locates the OXQ axis in the \"classical\"\nframe. Thus\n\u0010\n\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\n\u03c6Q\nL = \u03c6L \u2212 ArcXY \u2212N \u2212 L sin \u03b8L cos \u03c6L , \u2212L sin \u03b8L sin \u03c6L\n\n=\n\n\u03c6C\nL \u2212 ArcXY\n\n\u0012 q\n\n\u2212\n\nJ2\n\n\u2212\n\nL2 (1\n\n\u2212 sin\n\n2\n\n\u03b8LC\n\ncos2\n\n\u0011\n\n(A.6)\n\nC\n\u03c6C\nL ), \u2212L sin \u03b8L\n\nsin \u03c6C\nL\n\n\u0013\n\nwhere the second line is obtained by using eq. (1) which was written in the\n\"Classical\" molecular frame.\nC\nFinally notice that the transformation between { LZQ , \u03c6Q\nL } and { LZC , \u03c6L }\nis not canonical, as can be checked by mere differentiation from the non conservation of dLZ \u2227d\u03c6L (where \u2227 denotes the exterior differential product). We\nhave computed a generating function, and it can be checked by differentiation\nthat a momentum conjugated to \u03c6C\nL would be\n\nI(\u03c6C\nL , \u03b8L ) = L cos \u03b8L +\n(J 2 \u2212 L2 )F\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\nL2 cos2 \u03c6C\n\n\u2212 \u03b8L , J 2 \u2212L2 sin2L\u03c6C\nL\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2212 (J 2 \u2212 L2 sin2 \u03c6C\nL )E\n\nq\n\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\nL2 cos2 \u03c6C\n\n\u2212 \u03b8L , J 2 \u2212L2 sin2L\u03c6C\n\nC\n2\n2\ncos \u03c6C\nL J \u2212 L sin \u03c6L\n\nL\n\n\u0013\n\n(A.7)\n\nQ\nwhere E and F are elliptic functions, instead of LC\nZ = LZ = L cos \u03b8L . It can\nbe checked that the extra term vanishes when L/J \u226a 1, as it should do since\nin this case the frame recoil is negligible. The effect is thus small in this paper\nwhere we have selected L/J = 1/5 or 1/2. But this formula is too unwieldy\nto be of any use, especially since our main goal in using \"classical\" reference\nframe coordinates is physical visualizing of the results.\n\nA.2\n\nTransformation between \"Quantum\" molecular reference frame and laboratory reference frame\n\nThe canonical momentum and angle in the \"quantum\" molecular reference\nframe are LZQ and \u03c6Q\nL . The canonical momentum and angle in the laboratory\nframe (for the reduced phase space) are N and its conjugate angle \u03c6N , to\nbe defined, and not to be confused with \u03c6Q\nN (eq. A.3), which is the angle\nof N in the plane OXQ YQ . We first express N as a function of \"quantum\"\nmolecular coordinates (eq. (1) was with \"classical\" molecular coordinates).\nUsing eqs. (A.1, A.2) we obtain\nN 2 = J 2 + L2 \u2212 2L2ZQ + 2\n\nq\n\nq\n\nL2 \u2212 L2ZQ J 2 \u2212 L2ZQ cos \u03c6Q\nL\n\n(A.8)\n\nIntuitively (we will justify it below) the angle conjugate to N is the angle \u03c6N\n41\n\n\fof rotation of the molecular axis M\u0302 around N. The reference for this angle\ncan only be the position of J. Notice that the relative positions of J and N\nhave nothing special. We choose as reference axis around N the unit normal\nn to the plane {N, J}:\nn=\n\nN\u00d7J\nL\u00d7J\n=\n|N \u00d7 J|\n|L \u00d7 J|\n\n(A.9)\n\n(using N = J \u2212 L, \u00d7 denotes the skew vector product) and the unit binormal\nm=\n\nN\n\u00d7n\nN\n\n(A.10)\n\nso that, after a little algebra\n\u03c6N = ArcXY(n * M\u0302, m * M\u0302)\n!\n(L \u00d7 J)ZQ \u2212NJZQ\n,\n= ArcXY\n|L \u00d7 J| |L \u00d7 J|\n\n(A.11)\n\n\u2212 L2 \u2212 L2ZQ J 2 \u2212 L2ZQ sin \u03c6Q\nL \u2212NLZQ\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n= ArcXY\n,\n|L \u00d7 J|\n|L \u00d7 J|\n\uf8eb\n\nq\n\nq\n\nwith\nJ 2 + L2 \u2212 N 2\n|L \u00d7 J| = L J \u2212\n2\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\uf8f6\n\n(A.12)\n\n!2\n\n(A.13)\n\nThat this is the correct definition of \u03c6N is checked by showing by mere derivation that dLZQ \u2227 d\u03c6Q\nL = dN \u2227 d\u03c6N .\nReciprocal relations are obtained from the right part of eq.
