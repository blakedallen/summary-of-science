The second\nfeature is tightly connected to a quantitative estimation\nof mixing rates, that is how time correlations asymptotically decay. Though in extremely simplified models (simple Markov chains, lattice models with a finite transition\nmatrix) the connection between convergence of finite order estimates and mixing properties may be established\nquite easily, the issue in more general contexts is much\nmore complicated, and many facets of the problem still\nremain as open problems. In particular when weakly\nchaotic systems are considered it is expected that sticking to regular structures in the phase space severely degrades mixing properties, and critical, polynomial decay\nof temporal correlations can be observed. We remark\nthat mixed systems are thought to be generic [1], and\nthat slow polynomial decay may influence deeply deterministic transport properties [2], as the Kubo formula\nsuggests. We here propose to look at large deviation\nproperties of finite time estimates as an efficient tool to\nget quantitative information about mixing properties of\nthe system. We emphasize that the idea of a relationship\nbetween the tails of finite time distributions and memory effects is not new: for instance inspection of the tails\nof finite time Lyapunov exponents was used to get informations about qualitative changes in the dynamics of\ncoupled maps in [3], the detection of small regular islands in [4, 5], or motion of a particle in a random timedependent potential [6] (see also [7] for an example in\nhyperbolic dynamics). A rigorous analysis, inspiring the\npresent work, was presented in [8, 9]: originally [8] a\nclass of one-dimensional maps f was taken into account\n(the theoretical analysis was extended to higher dimensional systems in [10]: if we denote by \u03bb the Lyapunov\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: roberto.artuso@uninsubria.it\naddress: cmanchein@gmail.com\n\nexponent, and by Pn (\u03bbn ) the distribution of finite time\nestimates\n\u03bbn (x0 ) =\n\n1\ndf (n) (x)\nln\nn\ndx\n\n(1)\nx0\n\nthen, by fixing a threshold \u03bb\u0303 such that 0 < \u03bb\u0303 < \u03bb we\nmay estimate the fraction of initial conditions yielding\nan estimate below the threshold\nZ \u03bb\u0303\nM\u03bb\u0303 (n) =\nd\u03bbn Pn (\u03bbn ).\n(2)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThe quantity M\u03bb\u0303 (n) asymptotically vanishes if the system is ergodic (as we always suppose): for weakly chaotic\nsystem it may however decay polynomially\nM\u03bb\u0303 (n) \u223c\n\n1\n,\nn\u03be\n\n(3)\n\nin such a case a bound is proven [8] for correlation decay:\nC(n) \u2264\n\n1\nn\u03be\u22121\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere, as usual,\nC(n) =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03bc(x)\u03c6(x)\u03c8(f (n) (x))\n\nwhere \u03c6 and \u03c8 are taken in a suitable class of smooth\nobservables [11] and \u03bc is the invariant measure of the system. Actually in [8] M\u03bb\u0303 (n) is defined in a slightly different way (a full equivalence is established only via further\nassumptions): our definition accomplishes a twofold purpose: on the one side it allows a comparison with large\ndeviation estimates in [9], and on the other side it yields\nan easily computable quantity.\nThis actually leads to the main point of our paper: we\nargue that scrutinizing the way in which M\u03bb\u0303 (n) decays\nprovides an extremely efficient way of studying quantitatively the decay of correlations, a key issue in the analysis of fully and weakly chaotic dynamical systems. As\na matter of fact direct quantitative estimates of mixing\nrates are known to be quite delicate numerically [12], and\n\n\f2\nmany efforts have been devoted to devise how to tackle\nthe problem by alternative approaches, like return time\nstatistics [12, 13, 14, 15], which can be rigorously shown\nto yield the correct answer in 1d intermittency [16].\nThe plan of the paper is as follows: firstly we suggest,\nin view of recent results [9], that the estimate (4) is not\noptimal, and the decay properties of M\u03bb\u0303 (n) and C(n)\nare the same; then we check such a conjecture for a class\nof one-dimensional intermittent maps, where polynomial\ndecay rates of correlations are known exactly. We then\nconsider an intermittent area preserving map, which is a\nprototype example of intermittency in higher dimensions.\nWe finally reinvestigate, by this technique, the problem\nof generic correlation decay in maps with a mixed phase\nspace: in all cases the results are coherent with exact\nresults, and corroborate proposed conjectures, in a clean,\ncontrolled way.\n\nOne-dimensional system: the Pikovisky map\n\nOur first benchmark tool is represented by Pikovsky\nmap [21] Tz , which is implicitly defined by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 1 [1 + Tz (x)]z ,\n0 < x < 1/(2z),\n2z\nx=\n(6)\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 Tz (x) + [1 \u2212 Tz (x)]z , 1/(2z) < x < 1;\n2z\nwhile for negative values of x, the map is defined as\nTz (\u2212x) = \u2212Tz (x) [21]. Such a map has remarkable features, as in x = \u00b11 two marginal fixed points of the\nPomeau-Manneville type are present (and z is the corresponding intermittency parameter), while for any value\nof z the invariant measure is Lebesgue [21], as it can be\nseen by direct inspection of the Perron-Frobenius operator. For this map the correlations decay polynomially,\nwith an exponent that depends upon the intermittency\nparameter z [22]\n\nLARGE DEVIATIONS AND CORRELATION\nFUNCTION\n\nThe way in which we defined M\u03bb\u0303 (n) (2) is in the form\nof a large deviation result [17]: a remarkable connection between large deviations properties and correlation\ndecay was proven in [9] (see also [18]): if we consider\na system for which correlation of smooth functions decay polynomially (the smoothness is essential [11], see\nalso [19]) C(n) \u223c n\u2212\u03be then the following results hold, for\n(C\u00e9saro) finite time averages of an observable \u03c6:\nn\u22121\nX\nk=0\n\n\u03c6(f\n\n(k)\n\n(x)) \u2212 \u03c6| > \u01eb\n\n!\n\n\u2264 C\u03c6,\u01eb\n\n1\n;\nn\u03be\n\n(5)\n\n\u03bc being again the invariant measure, while \u03c6 denotes the\nphase average of the observable. In one dimension, by\ntaking \u03c6(x) = ln |f \u2032 (x)| this suggests that the bound (4)\ncould be sharpened, in such a way that correlation decay\nand large deviations are characterized by the same powerlaw exponent: on the other side in dimensions higher\nthan one finite estimates of Lyapunov exponents (computed for instance by selecting the largest eigenvalue of\nthe product of jacobians along a trajectory) lack composition structure of C\u00e9saro sums. Our claim is that, despite\nthese provisos, the asymptotic decay of M\u03bb\u0303 (n) quantitatively reproduces exactly the decay of correlations, and\ninspection of such a quantity provides an excellent tool\nto investigate the weak-chaos regime.\nBefore applying such a method to a number of dynamical systems, we point out that the way in which we\nconsider the exponent \u03be is as the lowest possible value\nin a suitable class of (zero mean) smooth functions: it\nis well known that specific choices of observables may\nyield faster decay (see [20] for a rigorous example in onedimensional intermittent dynamics).\n\n(7)\n\nThis decay is very well reproduced by numerical simulations for M\u03bb\u0303 (n), as we see from fig. (1). We remark that\nthe numerical simulations for the Pikovsky map were performed by using 106 initial conditions uniformly chosen\nin the phase space [\u22121, 1].\n1\n\n10\n\nz=1.5, \u03be=2.00 \u00b1 0.01\nz=2.0, \u03be=1.00 \u00b1 0.01\nz=4.0, \u03be=0.33 \u00b1 0.01\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n~\n\n\u03bc x |n\n\n\u22121\n\nC(n) \u223c n\u22121/(z\u22121) .\n\nM\u03bb(n)\n\nII.\n\nA.\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\nn\n\n5\n\n10\n\nFIG. 1: Numerical data (symbols), and regression fits (lines)\nof power-law decay of M\u03bb\u0303 (n) for Pikovsky map for three different values of the intermittency exponent. The fit for the\ncase z = 1.5 starts at n = 3000. Theoretical values for \u03be, from\n(7), are \u03be = 2, \u03be = 1 and \u03be = 1/3.\n\nWhen we want to check how well correlation decay is\nreproduced by large deviations, expressed by the decay of\nM\u03bb\u0303 (n), we have to be careful to take the large deviation\nparameter \u03bb\u0303 sufficiently far from the centre of the distribution: even if the general expectation is the asymptotic\ndecay law will not depend upon the cutoff, finite time estimates require that M picks up only contributions in the\ntail of the distribution. As a matter of fact any choice of\n\n\f3\nthe cutoff \u03bb\u0303 will determine a time scale \u03c4\u03bb\u0303 such that only\nafter such a transient the asymptotic decay is reproduced\ncorrectly. This is well illustrated in fig. (2) where were\nchosen three values of \u03bb\u0303 and we obtained the asymptotic\ndecay for all cases, but with different time scale \u03c4\u03bb\u0303 .\n\nB.\n\n\u22122\n\n~\n\nM\u03bb(n)\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\nn\n\n5\n\n10\n\n10\n\nIn fig.

When \u03b5 > 0 the map\nis hyperbolic, while for \u03b5 = 0 the fixed point at (0, 0)\nbecomes parabolic: in such a case dynamics close to the\nfixed point depends upon the value of \u03b3, which plays the\nrole of an intermittency parameter: correspondingly the\ndecay of correlations is exponential in the former case,\nwhile in the latter a power law is expected, with an exponent depending on \u03b3. In [27] the following law was\nproposed\nC(n) \u223c n\u22123(\u03b3+1)/(3\u03b3\u22121) ;\n\n(10)\n\nin the case \u03b3 = 1 a rigorous bound is proved [26] |C(n)| \u2264\nn\u22122 (while (10) predicts an exponent \u22123).\nOur numerical experiments encompass both regimes:\nin fig. (4a) a hyperbolic parameter choice leads to an\nexponential decay rate for M\u03bb\u0303 (n), while in the intermittent case a power law is observed, with an exponent in\nagreement with (10), see fig. (4b). In this case the numerical results were obtained by using 106 and 108 initial\nconditions uniformly distributed in the phase space, respectively.\nThe case reported in fig. (4b) allows to scrutinize the\nnumerical virtues of our approach with alternative methods (that were employed in [27]): it provides estimates\nas sharp as the analysis of return time statistics (by employing however much less initial conditions), while it\noutperforms direct computation of correlations.\nC.\n\nEnsemble of modified standard maps\n\nThe last case we present concerns a general issue,\nnamely whether universality properties are exhibited for\nHamiltonian systems with a hierarchical (mixed) phase\n\n\f4\npreserving maps, which we also utilize in the present\nframework.\nThe ensemble of modified standard maps on [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0)2\nconsidered here are given by\n\u001a\npn+1 = pn + K sin(xn ) + K \u2020 ,\nPK,K \u2020 :\n(12)\nxn+1 = xn + pn+1\n\n0\n\n10\n\n(a)\n\u22121\n\n~\n\nM\u03bb(n)\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n3\n\nn (x10 )\n0\n\n10\n\n(b)\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n~\n\nM\u03bb(n)\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n\u22125\n\n10\n\n\u22126\n\n10\n\n\u22127\n\n10\n\n\u22128\n\n10\n\n3\n\n4\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\nn\n\n10\n\nwhere K and K \u2020 are the nonlinear parameter and magnetic field, respectively. They are uniformly chosen in the\nintervals K \u2208 [\u03c0, 1.2 * \u03c0] and K \u2020 \u2208 [0.0, 0.4 * \u03c0]. We have\nused 106 initial conditions taken uniformly in the square\nx0 \u2208 [\u22120.1, 0.1], p0 \u2208 [\u22120.1, 0.1], well inside the chaotic\nregion. The behavior we show in fig. (5) apparently arises\nafter a few (\u223c 10) random realizations of the maps: the\noverall decay rate with an exponent 0.57 \u00b1 0.05 is stable,\nas well as the oscillations that may be noticed in fig. (5).\nWether such oscillations are due to finite size effects, corrections to scaling, or multifractality [33], is a feature that\nin our opinion deserves further investigations. Again we\nremark that the present method has an important advantage that it needs a \"small\" number of initial conditions\nand realizations of the map to show the asymptotic decay\nof M\u03bb\u0303 (n) as compared with traditional procedures using\ndirect computation of correlation functions or Poincar\u00e9\nrecurrences.\n0\n\n10\n\nspace. This is a much debated issue (we refer to [28, 29]\nfor relevant references over the last twenty years): in particular [28] suggests, on the basis of a Markov tree model\n[30] with random scaling factors for transition probabilities, the existence of an asymptotic algebraic decay for\nthe Poincar\u00e9 recurrences. The authors also discuss in\ndetail the numerical difficulties in probing such a claim:\nin particular, following [31, 32] they advocate that an\naverage over different Hamiltonian systems significantly\nreduces the extremely long times that are required for\na single trajectory to sample fine details of the phase\nspace structure: this procedure allows them to check for\nan ensemble of area preserving maps their proposal, and\nthe polynomial decay exponent of Poincar\u00e9 recurrences\nis estimated as \u03c7 \u2243 1.57 \u00b1 0.03, which, according to\n[12, 13, 14, 15], suggests for correlations the decay law\nC(n) \u223c\n\n1\nn\u03c7\u22121\n\n.\n\n(11)\n\nThe exponent of algebraic decay of Poincar\u00e9 recurrences\nwas also numerically investigated in [29] (with an estimate \u03c7 \u2243 1.60 \u00b1 0.05), for a different ensemble of area\n\n\u22121\n\nM\u03bb(n)\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n~\n\nFIG. 4: Decay M\u03bb\u0303 (n) (symbols) together with a regression\nfit (full lines) for the map (8) with (a) \u03b5 = 0.5 and \u03b3 = 1\n(exponential rate decay 0.87 \u00b1 0.01 ) and (b) \u03b5 = 0 and \u03b3 = 1\n(polynomial rate decay 3.05 \u00b1 0.05).

Another interesting point we plan\nto investigate in the future is to study the decay law of\ncorrelation function in higher dimensional systems where\nthe nonlinearity is not uniformly distributed along different unstable directions [34].\n\nOne of the authors (CM) gratefully acknowledges\nCNPq Brazil for a fellowship, and the Center for Nonlinear and Complex Systems in Como, for hospitality.\nWe thank Marcus W.
