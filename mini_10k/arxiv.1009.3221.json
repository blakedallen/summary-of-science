We present a study of the bar fraction in the Coma cluster galaxies based on a sample of \u223c190\ngalaxies selected from the SDSS-DR6 and observed with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera\nfor Survey (ACS). The unprecedented resolution of the HST-ACS images allows us to explore the presence of\nbars, detected by visual classification, throughout a luminosity range of 9 mag (\u221223 . Mr . \u221214), permitting\nus to study the poor known region of dwarf galaxies. We find that bars are hosted by galaxies in a tight range of\nboth luminosities (\u221222 . Mr . \u221217) and masses (109 . M\u2217 /M\u2299 . 1011 ). In addition, we find that the bar fraction\ndoes not vary significantly when going from the center to the cluster outskirts, implying that cluster environment\nplays a second-order role in bar formation/evolution. The shape of the bar fraction distribution with respect to\nboth luminosity and mass is well matched by the luminosity distribution of disk galaxies in Coma, indicating that\nbars are good tracers of cold stellar disks.\n\n1 Introduction\nStellar bars are observed in optical images of roughly half\nof all the nearby disk galaxies [2,1]. This fraction rises\nto about 59-62% when near-infrared images are analysed\n[5,7]. It is established that they appear naturally in most\nsimulations of galaxy formation once a dynamically cold\nand rotationally-supported disk is at place. However, even\nif bars are ubiquitous in the universe, it is not clear yet why\none galaxy can exhibit a bar structure while another apparently similar does not. With the recent advent of large\ngalaxy surveys statistical studies of bar frequencies have\nbeen possible. However, bar studies have been usually restricted to luminous galaxies due to either the lack of spatial resolution or because images were not deep enough.\nIn [6] we attempt to put observational constraints on the\ninternal (mass) and external (environment) parameters that\ninfluence bar formation by carrying out a comprehensive\nstudy of the bar fraction in the Coma cluster galaxies throughout a wide range of 9 magnitudes, covering from giant ellipticals (Mr \u223c \u221223) to dwarf galaxies (Mr \u223c \u221214). This\nresearch will also provide us the luminosity/mass interval\nwhere cold stellar disks are present in galaxies.\n\ngives essentially the same physical resolution as groundbased observations have in Virgo and it will allow us to resolve bars down to sizes of \u223c150 pc. In addition, the Coma\ncluster is also covered by the SDSS, providing galaxy magnitudes in five bands (u, g, r, i, z).\nWe create our catalog of sources using the SDSS-DR6.\nThe steps followed to obtain our final sample of Coma\ncluster members were: i) download a catalogue of extended\nsources (mr < 21, b/a > 0.5) from the SDSS-DR6 within\na 5 arcmin radius from the position of every ACS pointing. This resulted in a sample of 477 galaxies, 104 of them\nhaving recession velocities available from the NED. ii) Select galaxies with velocities \u00b13000 km/s (3\u03c3) with respect\nto the Coma redshift as cluster members. All 104 galaxies satisfy this condition. iii) Visually inspect every galaxy\nto determine its possible cluster membership based on its\nmorphology (see [8]). From the remaining 373 galaxies\nwithout redshift, 127 galaxies are cluster members following the morphological criteria. iv) A color cut condition\nwas imposed. Members should have a g \u2212 r color less than\n0.2 mag above the value of the red sequence fit.\nOur final sample of Coma secure members consists of\n188 galaxies with magnitudes in the range \u201323 < Mr < \u201314.\n\n2 Data and cluster membership selection\n\n3 Method and results\n\nThe HST-ACS Coma Cluster Treasury Survey [3] covers\n\u223c230 arcmin2 with 21 ACS pointings (\u223c3 \u00d7 3 arcmin2). At\nthe distance of the Coma cluster (\u223c100 Mpc), the resolution of HST-ACS (0.1 arcsec) corresponds to \u223c50 pc. This\n\nWe visually classified all galaxies into strong barred, weakly\nbarred, and unbarred using the redder available filter (F814W)\nof the HST-ACS images. Since our goal is to understand\nwhere bars form, we have used all galaxies, independently\nof their Hubble type, when calculating the bar fraction. Using this definition, our bar fraction turns to be \u223c9% and\n\na\n\ne-mail: jairo@iac.es\n\n\fEPJ Web of Conferences\n\nFig. 1. Optical bar fraction of strong (solid black line) and weak+strong (dashed blue line) as a function of the galaxy absolute magnitude\nin r band (left panel) and galaxy mass (right panel). Red points and black circles represent the strong and weak+strong bar fraction using\nthe field sample of Aguerri et al. (2009), respectively. The number of galaxies per bin is represented with black triangles. The disks\nluminosity distribution by Michard & Andreon (2008) is shown with brown diamonds.\n\n\u223c14% depending if only strong or also weak bars are included, respectively.\nFig. 1 shows the bar fraction as a function of the luminosity and mass of the secure sample of galaxies in the\nComa cluster. Independently of the bar strength, bars are\nhosted by galaxies in a tight range of luminosities or masses.\nThere are no strong bars in the Coma cluster out of the luminosity range between \u221221 . Mr . \u221218. These limits\nbecome \u221222 . Mr . \u221217 if we also include weak bars. We\nfind the same behavior in the bar fraction when using the\ngalaxy mass: bars exist only in a range of masses between\neither 109.5 . M\u2217 /M\u2299 . 1011 or 109 . M\u2217 /M\u2299 . 1011 depending on whether only strong or strong+weak bars are\nconsidered, respectively.\n\n4 Discussion and Conclusions\nIf bars are tracers of cold stellar disks, the presence of\nbars could be useful to identify galaxies with disks in clusters, and therefore, the distribution of bar fraction with the\ngalaxy magnitude should trace the shape of the disk galaxies' luminosity distribution. We have computed the luminosity distribution of morphologically selected disk galaxies (from S0 to Sc) using the classification by Michard\n& Andreon (2008). The resulting luminosity distribution\n(Fig. 1) matches well the shape of the bar fraction distribution in both luminosity and mass, confirming that bars are\ngood tracers of disks.\nSince our sample galaxies cover both the center and\ninfall regions of the Coma cluster, we have studied the influence on environment by dividing our sample into internal and external galaxies and calculating the bar fraction for every subsample. We have repeated this procedure\nfor three values of the separation distance (0.5, 1, and 1.5\nMpc) from the cluster center. For the smaller separation\ndistance, we found 14% and 15% of bars for the internal\nand external subsamples, respectively. The bar fractions of\n\nboth subsamples are 14% and 17% when using 1 Mpc, and\n14% and 17% if we use 1.5 Mpc. Therefore, we did not find\ndifferences in the bar fraction between the subsamples for\nany separation distance, implying that the cluster environment plays a second-order role in bar formation/evolution.\nFew works have investigated the dwarf realm in order\nto look for the presence of bars. Lisker et al. (2006), studying a sample of dwarf galaxies in the Virgo cluster, claim\nthat dwarf ellipticals with and without disks represent two\ndistinct types of galaxies, and show how the fraction of\ndwarfs with disks decreases dramatically for galaxies below MB \u223c \u201316. Therefore, even if the non-presence of bars\nin our low-luminosity galaxies could be due to the heating of the disk component or due to its absence, our result\nsupport that of Lisker et al. (2006), and we suggest that\nno disks are present in Coma dwarf galaxies below Mr \u223c\n\u201317. This result is also supported by the recent work of\nS\u00e1nchez-Janssen et al. (2010) where they found, for a large\nsample of galaxies in the field, that disks becomes thicker\nfor galaxies with M\u2217 /M\u2299 \u2264 2\u00d7109.\n\nReferences\n1. Aguerri, J. A.
