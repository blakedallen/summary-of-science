It is shown that any transverse invariant measure of a foliated\nspace can be considered as a measure on the ambient space.\n\n1. Introduction\nTransverse invariant measures of foliated spaces play an important role in the\nstudy of their transverse dynamics. They are measures on transversals invariant by\nholonomy transformations. There are many interpretations of transverse invariant\nmeasures; in particular, they can be extended to generalized transversals, which\nare defined as Borel sets that meet each leaf in a countable set [4]. Here, we show\nthat indeed invariant measures can be extended to the \u03c3-algebra of all Borel sets\nbecoming an \"ambient\" measure (a measure on the ambient space). Precisely, the\nfollowing result is proved.\nTheorem 1.1. Let X be a foliated space with a transverse invariant measure \u039b.\ne on X such that \u039b(T\ne ) = \u039b(T ) for all generalized\nThere exists a Borel measure \u039b\ntransversal T .\ne is constructed as a \"pairing\" of the transverse invariant measure \u039b with\nThis \u039b\nthe counting measure on the leaves. Connes has proved that this pairing is coherent\nfor generalized transversals but it can not be directly extended to any Borel set since\nthe local projection of a Borel set is not necessarily a Borel set [6, 7]. The solution\nof this problem is the main difficulty of the proof. In fact, this result is proved in\nthe more general setting of foliated measurable spaces [1, 2]. The uniqueness of this\nextension is also discussed.\ne will be used in study of the concept of \u039b-LS category, which\nThe extension \u039b\nwill appear elsewhere.\n2. Foliated measurable spaces\n\nA Polish space is a completely metrizable and separable topological space. A\nstandard Borel space is a measurable space isomorphic to a Borel subset of a Polish space. A measurable topological space or MT-space X is a set equipped with\na \u03c3-algebra and a topology. Usually, measure theoretic concepts will refer to the\n\u03c3-algebra of X, and topological concepts will refer to its topology. Notice that the\n\u03c3-algebra does not necessarily agree with the Borel \u03c3-algebra associated with the\ntopology. An MT-map between MT-spaces is a measurable continuous map. An\nMT-isomorphism is a map which is a measurable isomorphism and a homeomorphism, simultaneously.\nLet T be a standard Borel space. On T \u00d7Rn , we consider the \u03c3-algebra generated\nby products of Borel subsets of T and Rn , and the product of the discrete topology\n1\n\n\f2\n\nCARLOS MENI\u00d1O COT\u00d3N\n\non T and the Euclidean topology on Rn . T \u00d7 Rn will be endowed with the structure\nof MT-space defined by this \u03c3-algebra and this topology.\nA foliated measurable chart on X is an MT-isomorphism \u03c6 : U \u2192 T \u00d7 Rn ,\nwhere U is open and measurable in X. A foliated measurable atlas on X is a\ncountable family of foliated measurable charts whose domains cover X. The sets\n\u03c6\u22121 ({\u2217} \u00d7 Rn ) are the plaques of the foliated chart \u03c6 and the sets \u03c6\u22121 (T \u00d7 {\u2217}) are\ncalled transversals induced by \u03c6. A foliated measurable space is an MT-space that\nadmits a foliated measurable atlas. Observe that we always consider countable\natlases. The connected components of X are called its leaves. An example of\nfoliated measurable space is a foliated space with its Borel \u03c3-algebra and the leaf\ntopology. According to this definition, the leaves are second countable connected\nmanifolds but they may not be Hausdorff.\nA measurable subset T \u2282 X is called a generalized transversal if its intersection\nwith each leaf is countable; these are slightly more general than the transversals of\n[1], which are required to have discrete and closed intersection with each leaf. Let\nT (X) be the set of generalized transversals of X. This set is closed under countable\nunions and intersections, but it is not a \u03c3-algebra.\nA measurable holonomy transformation is a measurable isomorphism \u03b3 : T \u2192 T \u2032 ,\nfor T, T \u2032 \u2208 T (X), which maps each point to a point in the same leaf. A transverse\ninvariant measure on X is a \u03c3-additive map \u039b : T (X) \u2192 [0, \u221e] which is invariant\nby measurable holonomy transformations. The classical definition of transverse invariant measure in the context of foliated spaces is a measure on usual transversals\ninvariant by usual holonomy transformations [3]. Both definitions are equivalent in\nthe case of foliated measurable spaces induced by foliated spaces [4].\n3. Case of a product foliated measurable space\nIn this section, we take foliated measurable spaces of the form T \u00d7 P , where T is\na standard measurable space and P a connected, separable and Hausdorff manifold.\nIndeed, the results of this section hold when P is any Polish space. We assume that\na new topology is given in this space as follows. All standard Borel spaces are Borel\nisomorphic to a finite set, Z or the interval [0, 1] (see [7, 8]). Identify T \u00d7 P with\nZ \u00d7 P , [0, 1] \u00d7 P or A \u00d7 P (A finite), via a Borel isomorphism. We work with two\ntopologies in T \u00d7 P . On the one hand, the topology of the MT-structure is the\nproduct of discrete topology on T and the topology of P . On the other hand, the\ntopology is the product of the topology of [0, 1], N or P with the topology of P ;\nthe term \"open set\" is used with this topology. The \u03c3-algebra of the MT-structure\non T \u00d7 P is generated by these \"open sets\". Let \u03c0 : T \u00d7 P \u2192 T be the first factor\nprojection.\nProposition 3.1 (R.Kallman [5]). If B \u2282 T \u00d7P is a Borel set such that B\u2229({t}\u00d7P )\nis \u03c3-compact for all t \u2208 T , then \u03c0(B) is a Borel set. Moreover there exists a\nBorel subset B \u2032 \u2282 B such that #(B \u2032 \u2229 ({t} \u00d7 P )) = 1 if B \u2229 ({t} \u00d7 P ) 6= \u2205, and\n#(B \u2032 \u2229 ({t} \u00d7 P )) = 0 otherwise.\nFor any measurable space (X, M, \u039b), the completion of M with respect to \u039b is\nthe \u03c3-algebra\nM\u039b = { Z \u2282 X | \u2203 A, B \u2208 M, A \u2282 Z \u2282 B, \u039b(B \\ A) = 0 } .\nThe measure \u039b extends in a natural way to M\u039b by defining \u039b(Z) = \u039b(A) = \u039b(B)\nfor Z, A, B as above.\n\n\fTRANSVERSE INVARIANT MEASURES EXTEND TO THE AMBIENT SPACE\n\n3\n\nNow, let \u039b be a Borel measure on T . Define\n\u03c0(B \u2217 , B \u039b ) = { B \u2282 B \u2217 | \u03c0(B \u2229 U ) \u2208 B \u039b \u2200 open U \u2282 T \u00d7 P } ,\nwhere B and B \u2217 are the Borel \u03c3-algebras of T and T \u00d7 P , respectively.\nProposition 3.2. \u03c0(B \u2217 , B \u039b ) is closed under countable unions.\nProof. This is obvious since, for any countable family {Bn } \u2282 B \u2217 , we obtain\nS\n\u2217\nn Bn \u2208 B and\n!\n!\n[\n[\n\u03c0\n\u03c0(Bn \u2229 U ) \u2208 B \u039b\nBn \u2229 U =\nn\n\nn\n\nfor any open subset U \u2282 T \u00d7 P .\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 3.3. If \u039b is \u03c3-finite (i.e., T is a countable union of Borel sets with finite\n\u039b-measure), then \u03c0(B \u2217 , B \u039b ) = B \u2217 : by Exercise 14.6 in [6], any set in B \u2217 projects\nonto an analytic set, which is \u039b-measurable since \u039b is \u03c3-finite [7, Theorem 4.3.1].\nRemark 3.4. If B \u2208 \u03c0(B \u2217 , B \u039b ) and U is an open set, then B \u2229 U \u2208 \u03c0(B \u2217 , B \u039b ). By\nProposition 3.1, \u03c0(B \u2217 , B \u039b ) contains the Borel sets with \u03c3-compact intersection with\nthe plaques {t} \u00d7 P .\nNow, we want to extend \u039b to all Borel sets satisfying the conditions of a measure.\nLet B \u2217\u2217 denote the Borel \u03c3-algebra of T \u00d7 P \u00d7 T \u00d7 P , \u03c0\ne the natural projection\nT \u00d7 P \u00d7 T \u00d7 P \u2192 T \u00d7 T , and hB \u039b \u00d7 B \u039b i the \u03c3-algebra generated by sets of the\nform A \u00d7 B for A, B \u2208 B \u039b .\nLemma 3.5. If B, B \u2032 \u2208 \u03c0(B \u2217 , B \u039b ), then B \u00d7 B \u2032 \u2208 \u03c0\ne(B \u2217\u2217 , hB \u039b \u00d7 B \u039b i).\n\nProof. Since B, B \u2032 \u2208 B \u2217 , we have B \u00d7 B \u2032 \u2208 B \u2217\u2217 . Observe that S\nevery open set\n\u221e\nU \u2282 T \u00d7 P is a countable union of products of open sets. Write U = n=1 (Un \u00d7 Vn )\nwith Un and Vn open subsets of T and P , respectively. Then\n!\n\u221e\n[\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03c0\ne ((B \u00d7 B ) \u2229 U ) = \u03c0\ne (B \u00d7 B ) \u2229\n(Un \u00d7 Vn )\nn=1\n\n=\u03c0\ne\n\n\u221e\n[\n\n\u2032\n\n((B \u2229 Un ) \u00d7 (B \u2229 Vn ))\n\nn=1\n\n!\n\n=\n\n\u221e\n[\n\nn=1\n\n=\n\n\u03c0\ne ((B \u2229 Un ) \u00d7 (B \u2032 \u2229 Vn ))\n\n\u221e\n[\n\n(\u03c0(B \u2229 Un ) \u00d7 \u03c0(B \u2032 \u2229 Vn )) ,\n\nn=1\n\nwhich is in hB \u039b \u00d7 B \u039b i.\n\n\u0003\n\n\u2217\n\nDefinition 3.6.

A measure on T induces a transverse invariant measure on T \u00d7 P .\ne\nWhen B is a generalized transversal, \u039b(B)\nis the value of this transverse invariant\nmeasure on B.

To prove this property, we proceed by induction on\nn. It is clear that h\u22121 ({0}) = T \\ \u03c0(B) belongs to B \u039b since B \u2208 \u03c0(B \u2217 , B \u039b ). Now,\nsuppose h\u22121 ({i}) \u2208 B \u039b for i \u2208 {0, ..., n \u2212 1} and let us check that h\u22121 ({n}) \u2208 B \u039b .\nLet\nCn = { ((t, p1 ), (t, p2 ), ..., (t, pn+1 )) | t \u2208 T, p1 , ..., pn+1 \u2208 P } ,\nwhich is a closed in (T \u00d7 P )n+1 . Observe that Cn is the set of (n + 1)-uples in T \u00d7 P\nthat lie in the same plaque. We remark that Cn is homeomorphic to \u2206T \u00d7 P n+1 ,\nwhere \u2206T is the diagonal of the product T n+1 , and the projection \u03c0T : \u2206T \u2192 T ,\n(t, ..., t) 7\u2192 t is a homeomorphism. The measure \u039b becomes a measure on \u2206T via\n\u03c0T . The intersection B n+1 \u2229 Cn , denoted by Dn , is the set of (n + 1)-uples in B\nthat lie in the same plaque.

Since B \u221e \u2208 B \u039b , there is some A \u2208 B such that B \u221e \u2282 A\nand \u039b(A) = 0. The Borel set \u03c0 \u22121 (A) satisfies B1 \u2229 \u03c0 \u22121 (A) \u2208 \u03c0(B \u2217 , B \u039b ) since\n\u2205 \u2282 \u03c0(B1 \u2229 \u03c0 \u22121 (A) \u2229 U ) \u2282 A and \u039b(A) = 0 for each open set U \u2282 T \u00d7 P . On the\nother hand, B1 \\ \u03c0 \u22121 (A) is a Borel set meeting every plaque in a finite set, which\nis \u03c3-compact, and therefore projects to a Borel set by Proposition 3.1.

The measure \u03bc is called a coherent extension of \u039b if satisfies the following\nconditions:\n(a) If B \u2208 B \u2217 , B 6\u2282 \u03c0 \u22121 (S) for any S \u2208 B with \u039b(S) = 0, and #B\u2229{t}\u00d7P = \u221e\nfor each plaque {t} \u00d7 P which meets B, then \u03bc(B) = \u221e.\n(b) If \u039b(S) = 0 for some S \u2208 B, then \u03bc(\u03c0 \u22121 (S)) = 0.\n(c) If B \u2208 B \u2217 and \u039b(S) = \u221e for all S \u2208 B with B \u2282 \u03c0 \u22121 (S), then \u03bc(B) = \u221e.\nRemark 3.12. Condition (a) determines \u03bc on Borel sets with infinite points in\nplaques which are not contained in the saturation of a \u039b-null set.

Condition (c) determines \u03bc on any Borel set so that any Borel set containing its\nproyection has infinity \u039b-measure.\ne is the unique coherent extension.\nProposition 3.13. \u039b\n\ne on B \u2217 .\nProof. We prove that every coherent extension has the same values as \u039b\n\u2217\nFirst, we consider the case B \u2208 \u03c0(B , B \u039b ). Let\nB \u221e = { t \u2208 T | #(B \u2229 ({t} \u00d7 P )) = \u221e } .\n\nThis set belongs to B \u039b by Proposition 3.8. Therefore there exist Borel sets A, C\ne \u221e = B \u2229 \u03c0 \u22121 (C). The Borel\nsuch that A \u2282 B \u221e \u2282 C and \u039b(C \\ A) = 0.

On\nset B \\ B\n\\B\ne \u221e ))) = 0, then \u039b(C) = 0 and \u03bc(B\ne \u221e ) \u2264 \u03bc(\u03c0 \u22121 (C)) = 0\nthe other hand, if \u039b(\u03c0(B\n\u221e\n\u221e\n\u22121\n\u2032\u221e\nb\nby (b). If \u039b(B )) > 0, let B = B \u2229 \u03c0 (A) and B = B \u2229 \u03c0 \u22121 (C \\ A). Then\nb \u221e ) = \u221e by (a), and \u03bc(B \u2032\u221e ) = 0 by (b). Therefore \u03bc equals \u039b\ne on \u03c0(B \u2217 , B \u039b ).\n\u03bc(B\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u221e\nThe case B \u2208 B \\ \u03c0(B , B \u039b ) is similar. The set B is not a Borel set in this\ncase, but observe that (B \u2229 \u03c0 \u22121 (B \u221e )) * \u03c0 \u22121 (S) with \u039b(S) < \u221e or we obtain\n\u03c0(B \u2229 \u03c0 \u22121 (S) \u2229 U ) \u2208 B \u039b for all open set U \u2282 T \u00d7 P by Remark 3.3, since B \u2229\n\u03c0 \u22121 (S) \u2229 U is a Borel set in S \u00d7 P and \u039b is finite in S. Hence B \u2208 \u03c0(B \u2217 , B \u039b ) by\ne\nPropositions 3.2 and 3.1. Therefore \u03bc(B) = \u221e by (c). This proves that \u03bc and \u039b\n\u2217\nagree on B , as desired.\n\u0003\n4. The general case\nIn this section, we prove the following theorem.\nTheorem 4.1. Let X be a foliated measurable space with a transverse invariant\ne on X that extends \u039b.\nmeasure \u039b. There exists a measure \u039b\n\nLet {Ui , \u03c6i }i\u2208N be a foliated measurable atlas with \u03c6i (Ui ) = Ti \u00d7 Rn , where Ti\nis a standard Borel space.

Then there exists a sequence {Bn }n\u2208N of Borel subsets\nof T such that\n[\nB = (Bn \u00d7 Vn ).\nn\n\nWe take a countable base {Vm }m\u2208N of Rn by connected open sets.\n\nLemma 4.3. For i, j \u2208 N, there exists a sequence of Borel subsets\nS of Ti , {Bm }m\u2208N ,\nand a sequence of open sets {Wm }m\u2208N such that \u03c6i (Ui \u2229 Uj ) = m (Bm \u00d7 Wm ) and\n\u03c6j \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121\ni (t, x) = (fijm (t), gijm (t, x)) for (t, x) \u2208 Bm \u00d7 Wm , where each fijm is a\nBorel isomorphism.\n\u2032\nProof. We apply Theorem\n4.2 to \u03c6j (Ui \u2229 Uj ) and obtain a family {Bm\n}m\u2208N such\nS\n\u2032\nthat \u03c6j (Ui \u2229 Uj ) = m (Bm \u00d7 Vm ). Now we apply Theorem 4.2 to each set \u03c6i \u25e6\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03c6\u22121\n(Bk\u2032 \u00d7 Vk ), k \u2208 N. We obtain sequences Bk,n\nsuch that \u03c6i \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121\nj (Bk \u00d7 Vk ) =\nSj\n\u22121\n\u2032\n\u2032\nm (Bk,m \u00d7 Vm ), k \u2208 N. The set \u03c6j \u25e6 \u03c6i ({t} \u00d7 Vm ), t \u2208 Bk,m , is contained in\nonly one plaque {\u2217} \u00d7 Rn since each Vm is connected. Therefore, \u03c6j \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121\ni (t, x) =\n\u2032\n(fijkm (t), gijkm (t, x)) for (t, x) \u2208 Bk,m\n\u00d7 Vm . We must show that fijkm is one-toone. If there exist t, t\u2032 \u2208 Ti with fijkm (t) = fijkm (t\u2032 ) = t\u2032\u2032 , then gijkm ({t} \u00d7 Vm )\nand gijkm ({t\u2032 } \u00d7 Vm ) are connected open subsets of the plaque {t\u2032\u2032 } \u00d7 Vk in Bk\u2032 \u00d7 Vk ,\nbut this plaque is the image by \u03c6j \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121\nof a connected open set since \u03c6j and \u03c6i\ni\nare homeomorphisms. Hence this set is contained in a single plaque of Ui . This is\na contradiction with the assumption t 6= t\u2032 .\nThe functions fijkm are, obviously, measurable and they have measurable image by Proposition 3.1, hence the image is a standard Borel space. Since fijkn\nis a one-to-one measurable function between standard Borel spaces, it is a Borel\nisomorphism [7]. The proof is completed by observing that the required sequence\n\u2032\nBm \u00d7 Wm is the bisequence Bk,m\n\u00d7 Vm k, m \u2208 N.\n\u0003\n\nLemma 4.4.

By Lemma 4.3, there exists a countable family of measurable holonomy\n\u22121\ntransformations from \u03c6\u22121\ni (Ti \u00d7 {\u2217}) to \u03c6j (Tj \u00d7 {\u2217}) whose domains and ranges\ncover \u03c0i (Ui \u2229 Uj ) and \u03c0j (Ui \u2229 Uj ), respectively. Therefore, if A is a Borel set\ncontained in Ui \u2229 Uj and \u03c0i (A) is a Borel set, then \u03c0j (A) is a Borel set and\n\u039b(\u03c0i (A)) = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 \u039b(\u03c0j (A)) = 0 .\n\u0003\ne i (B) = \u039b\ne j (B) for all Borel set B \u2282 Ui \u2229 Uj , i, j \u2208 N.\nLemma 4.5. \u039b\n\ne i and \u039b\ne j have the same values in generalized transversals\nProof. We remark that \u039b\nof Ui \u2229 Uj . By Lemma 4.4, we only consider Borel sets in \u03c0i (B \u2217 , B \u039b ). Suppose that\n\u03c0i (B) is a Borel set; otherwise, \u03c0i (B) is \u039b-measurable and we can choose a Borel\ne = B \u2229 \u03c0 \u22121 (A).\nset A \u2282 \u03c0i (B) with \u039b(\u03c0i (B) \\ A) = 0.
