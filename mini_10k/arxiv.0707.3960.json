Introduction\n\nIt has been suggested that the volume is not a fundamental variable but rather the sum of the\ninitial (zero pressure-temperature) [Vo ] , thermal [Voth ] and elastic [Voel ] volumes (Garai, 2007).\nV = Vo + Voel + Voth .\n\n(1)\n\nSubscript o is used to indicate that these fundamental volume parts were determined by using\nthe newly defined volume coefficient of thermal expansion \u03b1 o and bulk modulus B o .\nThe thermodynamic equations describing these fundamental volume parts are\nVo = nVom\n\n(2)\n\nand\n1 \u2202V th\n\u03b1o \u2261\n,\nVp =0 \u2202T\n\n(3)\n\nand\n\nB o \u2261 \u2212VT =0\n\n\u2202p\n,\n\u2202V el\n\n(4)\n\nwhere n is the number of moles, Vom is the molar volume of the substance at zero pressure and\ntemperature, T is the temperature, and p is the pressure. The thermal volume can be calculated\nfrom Eq. (3) as:\n\uf8eb T \u03b1odT \uf8f6\n\uf8ec \u222b\n\uf8f7\nVoth = Vo \uf8ec e T =0 \u2212 1\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\nwhile the elastic volume from Eq. (4) as:\n\n-2-\n\n(5)\n\n\f\uf8eb \u2212 p 1 dp \uf8f6\n\uf8ec \u222b Bo\n\uf8f7\n\u2212 1\uf8f7 .\nVoel = Vo \uf8ec e p =0\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\n(6)\n\nSubstituting these fundamental volume components into Eq. (1) gives the actual volume [V] as:\nT\n\uf8eb \u2212 p 1 dp\n\uf8f6\n\u03b1 o dT\n\uf8ec \u222b Bo\n\uf8f7\n\u222b\n+ e T =0 \u2212 1\uf8f7 .\nV = Vo \uf8ec e p=0\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\n(7)\n\nBased on theoretical considerations it has been suggested that the temperature derivatives of\nthe volume coefficient of thermal expansion and the bulk modulus are zero (Garai, 2007).\nAssuming that the pressure derivatives are constant and introducing the multipliers [a, c] Eq. (7)\ncan be written as:\nT\n\uf8eb \u2212 p 1 dp\n\uf8f6\n( cp + \u03b1 o ) dT\n\uf8ec \u222b ap + Bo\n\uf8f7\n\u222b\nV = Vo \uf8ec e p = 0\n+ e T =0\n\u2212 1\uf8f7 .\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\nNew (5)\n\n(8)\n\nThe New (5) EoS was tested to the available experiments of perovskite with positive result.\nThe number in the parenthesis refers to the number of parameters in the equation.\n\n2. Experiments of epsilon iron\n\nIron, the prime constituent of the core, changes its phase and the different polymorphs are\nstable only within limited pressure and temperature intervals. At core pressures epsilon and\npossibly beta phase are stable (Nguyen, 2004). Experiments are available in the epsilon phase\n(Dubrovinsky et al., 1997; 1998; 1998; 2000; Saxena and Dubrovinsky 2000; Saxena et al.,\n1995; Saxena, 2003, Mao et al. 1987, Mao et al. 1990, N. Funamori et al. 1996; T. Uchida et al.\n\n-3-\n\n\f2001). The 289 experiments span the pressure and temperature range of 11-306 GPa and 2931573 K respectively. The distribution of the experiments is shown on Fig. 1.\nThe fitting parameters for the New (5) EoS [Eq. (8)] were calculated. The correlation\ncoefficient is relatively low R = 0.997035 and the RMSD value for the molar volume is 0.059\ncm3. The volume coefficient of thermal expansion has negative value which seems to be\nunreasonable (Table 1). Using hit or miss method many modified version of Eq. (8) were tested.\nThe best fit occurred when an exponential factor [b] has been introduced.\nT\n\uf8eb \u2212 p 1 dp\n\uf8f6\n( cp + \u03b1 o ) dT\n\uf8ec \u222b ap b + Bo\n\uf8f7\n\u222b\n+ e T =0\n\u2212 1\uf8f7 .\nV = Vo \uf8ec e p = 0\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\n(9)\n\nor after the integration\n\uf8eb ap b\u2212+pB\n\uf8f6\no\n+ e ( cp + \u03b1 o ) T \u2212 1\uf8f7 .\nV = Vo \uf8ec e\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\nNew (6)\n\n(10)\n\nThe introduction of exponential factor for the volume coefficient of thermal expansion was\nalso tested but it did not improve the fitting. The parameters providing the best fit for New (6)\nare: K o = 116.31 GPa , Vo = 6.818 cm 3 , \u03b1 o = 2.823 \u00d7 10 \u22124 K \u22121 , a = 6.439, b = 0.7563 and\n\nc = \u22127.119 \u00d7 10 \u22128 K \u22121GPa \u22121 . The root-mean-square-deviations (RMSD) of the residuals are\n0.021 cm3, 2.0 GPa, and 145 K for the molar volume, pressure, and temperature respectively.\nBased on visual inspections clustering of the experiments conducted by the different labs is\nnoticeable indicating that systematic errors might be present in the experiments (Fig. 2.).\nEquation (10) predicts that the volume coefficient of expansion is diminished above a certain\npressure that I will call solid critical pressure [p \u03b1 o = 0 ] .\n\n-4-\n\n\fp \u03b1o =0 =\n\n\u03b1o\nb\n\n(11)\n\nThe diminishing of the volume coefficient of thermal expansion indicates that at pressures\nhigher than the solid critical pressure the interatomic potential energy becomes symmetrical and\nthe temperature does not affect the volume. In order to avoid negative value for the volume\ncoefficient of thermal expansion the introduction of a multiplier [I] is necessary\n\uf8eb ap\u2212+pBo\n\uf8f6\n+ e I ( bp + \u03b1 o ) T \u2212 1\uf8f7\uf8f7 .\nV = Vo \uf8ec\uf8ec e\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\nNew (6)\n\n(12)\n\nThe multiplier is defined as:\n\nI \u2261 1 if p \u03b1 o = 0 > p\nand\nI \u2261 0 if p \u03b1 o = 0 \u2264 p\n\n(13)\n\nThe New (6) EoS allows calculating any of the variables. The analytical solution of Equation\n(12) for the temperature is\n\u2212p\n\uf8ebV\n+ 1 \u2212 e ap + K o\nln\uf8ec\uf8ec\nVo\nT=I \uf8ed\nbp + \u03b1 o\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8.\n\n(14)\n\nThe pressure can be determined by repeated substitution until convergence is reached as:\n\uf8eeV\n\uf8f9\np = lim p n +1 = \u2212(ap n + K o ) ln \uf8ef + 1 \u2212 e I ( bp n + \u03b1 o ) T \uf8fa\nn \u219210\n\uf8f0 Vo\n\uf8fb\n\n(15)\n\nwhere\nn \u2208 \u00f9*\n\nand\n\np1 = 0 .\n\n(16)\n\nThe convergence of equation (15) is the function of the pressure. For the maximum pressure\nused in this study n = 20 gives sufficiently good result.\n\n-5-\n\n\f3. Comparing the new EoS to isothermal EoSs\n\nThe data set was separated into groups covering 200 K temperature range. Within this\ntemperature range it was assumed that the condition is isothermal. For each temperature range\nthe fitting parameters of the most widely used, finite strain, interatomic potential, and empirical\nisothermal EoSs [Eqs. (17)-(20)] were determined. Good summary of the contemporary EoSs\ncan be found in Garai (2007).\nThe most popular finite strain EoS is the Burch-Murnaghan (Murnaghan, 1937, 1944; Birch,\n1947)\n\n3B 0\np=\n2\n\n7\n5\n2\n\uf8f9\uf8fc\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\uf8f1\n\uf8ee\n3\n3\n3\nV\nV\nV\n3\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f4\n'\n0\n0\n0\n\uf8ef\uf8ec \uf8f7 \u2212 \uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8fa \uf8f21 + (B 0 \u2212 4)\uf8ef\uf8ec \uf8f7 \u2212 1\uf8fa \uf8f4\uf8fd .\n\uf8fa\uf8f4\n\uf8ef\uf8ed V \uf8f8\n\uf8ef\uf8ed V \uf8f8 \uf8ed V \uf8f8 \uf8fa \uf8f4 4\n\uf8fb\uf8fe\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\uf8f3\n\uf8f0\n\n(17)\n\nThe universal EoS derived by Rose from a general inter-atomic potential (Rose et al. 1984) and\npromoted by Vinet (Vinet, 1987a, 1987b) is the most widely used interatomic potential EoS\nwhich gives very good results at high pressures.\n1 \u2212 f V \uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8f0 2 ( B ' \u22121)(1\u2212f V )\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fb\np = 3K 0 2 e\nfV\n3\n\n(18)\n\nwhere\n1\n\n\uf8eb V \uf8f63\nf V = \uf8ec\uf8ec \uf8f7\uf8f7 .\n\uf8ed V0 \uf8f8\n\n(19)\n\nRoy and Roy (1999) introduced an empirical EoS\n\uf8ee ln (1 + ap ) \uf8f9\nV = V0 \uf8ef1 \u2212\n,\nb + cp \uf8fa\uf8fb\n\uf8f0\n\n(20)\n\n-6-\n\n\fwhere\n\na=\n\n1\n8B 0\n\n\uf8ee3(B ' + 1) + (25B ' 2 + 18B ' \u2212 32B B '' \u2212 7 )12 \uf8f9\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\uf8ef\uf8f0 0\n\uf8fa\uf8fb\n\n1\n1\nb = \uf8ee\uf8ef3(B '0 + 1) + (25B '02 + 18B '0 \u2212 32B 0 B '0' \u2212 7 )2 \uf8f9\uf8fa\n8\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n\n1\n1\n1 \uf8ee '\n1\uf8ee '\n\uf8f9\n\uf8f9\n'2\n'\n''\n'2\n'\n''\n2 (B ' + 1) \u2212\n2\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n3\nB\n1\n25\nB\n18\nB\n32\nB\nB\n7\n3\nB\n1\n25\nB\n18\nB\n32\nB\nB\n7\n+\n+\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n+\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\uf8fa\uf8fb 0\n\uf8fa\uf8fb\n16 \uf8ef\uf8f0\n8 \uf8ef\uf8f0\nand demonstrated its applicability to the wide variety of substances. The symbols, V0 and K 0\n\nc=\n\nare the volume and the bulk modulus at zero pressure respectively and K '0 is the first derivative\nof the bulk modulus.\nUsing the parameters of the New (6) EoS determined from the overall fit, the volume and the\npressure was calculated for experiments falling into the 200 K region. From the residuals of the\nvolume and the pressure the RMSD and AIC values were calculated [New (6-0)]. The second\nnumber indicates the number of parameters allowed to change for the isothermal fitting. Using\nfixed values (determined from the overall fitting) for the initial volume, for the volume\ncoefficient of thermal expansion, and the pressure derivative of the volume coefficient of thermal\nexpansion, the fitting parameters of the New (6-3) EoS were calculated.\n3.1. Fitting criteria\n\nThe fitting accuracy of empirical EoSs with the same number of parameters is evaluated by\ncorrelation coefficients and/or root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs). The fit quality of models\nusing different numbers of parameters can not be evaluated by their correlation coefficients only\n(Lindsey, 2004; Burnham and Anderson, 2002, 2004). The test devised assessing the right level\nof complexity is the Akaike Information Criteria AIC (Akaike, 1973, 1974). Assuming normally\n\n-7-\n\n\fdistributed errors, the criterion is calculated as:\n\uf8eb RSS \uf8f6\nAIC = 2k + n ln\uf8ec\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8ed n \uf8f8\n\n(21)\n\nwhere n is the number of observations, RSS is the residual sum of squares, and k is the\nnumber of parameters. The preferred model is the one which has the lowest AIC value.\nBased on the AIC values both New (6-0) and New (6-3) fit better to experiments than the\nRoy-Roy EoS in every temperature range. The New (6-0) gives better fit two times but weaker\nfit four times in comparison to the Birch-Murnaghan and Vinet EoSs. The New (6-3) is superior\nto the Birch-Murnaghan EoS in every temperature range and gives better fitting in five cases out\nof the six in comparison to the Vinet EoS.\n\n4. Inner core densities\n\nUsing the determined thermodynamic parameters for epsilon iron the inner core densities\nwere calculated (Fig. 3). The new EoS predicts lower densities for the inner core than previous\ninvestigations (Saxena, 2003). Assuming 6000 K temperature in the inner core the EoS\ndetermined from all of the data gives 2.8-4.9% higher iron densities than the densities of the\nPREM model.\nThe separate clustering of the residuals of the Funamori et al. (1996) from the rest of the data\nindicates that the experiments contain a systematic error. Removing the Funamori's experiments\nfrom the data set the parameters of the New (6) EoS were determined. Calculating the densities\nfrom these new parameters the PREM inner core densities can be reproduced within 1% if 8000\nK is assumed for the temperature of the inner core. The EoS parameters were also determined\nusing the experiments of (Dubrovinsky et al. 1997; 1998-a-b; 2000 and Mao et al. 1987, 1990).\n\n-8-\n\n\fThe calculated core densities from these experiments reproduce the PREM densities within one\npercent if 6000 K temperature is assumed for the inner core.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nThe author's new EoS was tested against experiments of epsilon iron. The pressure derivative\nof iron is not constant and the introduction of an exponential factor is required.\nIt is suggested that at pressures higher than the solid critical pressure the potential well\nbecomes symmetrical and the temperature has no effect on the volume. The solid critical\npressure for epsilon iron is around 400 GPa.\nThe parameters providing the best fit for epsilon iron are: K o = 116.31 GPa ,\nVo = 6.818 cm 3 , \u03b1 o = 2.823 \u00d7 10 \u22124 K \u22121 , a = 6.439, b = 0.7563 and c = \u22127.119 \u00d7 10 \u22128 K \u22121 GPa \u22121 .\nThe root-mean-square-deviations (RMSD) of the molar volume, pressure, and temperature are\n0.021 cm3, 2.0 GPa and 144.9 K respectively. These values are slightly higher than the\nuncertainties of the experiments.\nSeparating the experiments into 200 K temperature range the most widely used isothermal\nEoSs, Birch-Murnaghan, Vinet, and Roy & Roy equations were compared to the new EOS.\nBased on the RMSD and AIC values the new EOS is superior to the Roy-Roy and BirchMurnaghan EoSs and equal or better than the Vinet EoS.\nThe new EoS predicts lower densities for the inner core than previous investigations. It is\nsuggested that based on the currently available experiments it is too early to exclude the\npossibility of a pure iron-nickel core with no light elements.\nAcknowledgement\n\nThis research was supported by Florida International University Dissertation Year Fellowship.\n\n-9-\n\n\fReferences:\nAkaike, H., 1973.
