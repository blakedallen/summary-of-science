For example, the leading non-analytic behaviour of a baryon mass is\n3/2\nproportional to mq or m3\u03c0 . More generally, baryon masses can be written as an ordered\nexpansion in quark mass or m2\u03c0 .\nTo establish a model-independent framework in \u03c7 PT, the expansion must display the\nproperties of a convergent series for the terms considered. There is a power-counting\nregime (PCR) where the quark mass is sufficiently small such that higher order terms in\nthe expansion are negligible beyond the order calculated. That is, within the PCR, the\ntruncation of the chiral expansion is reliable to a prescribed precision [1, 2].\nThe asymptotic nature of the chiral expansion places the focus on the first few terms\nof the expansion. In chiral effective field theory (\u03c7 EFT), calculations beyond one-loop\nare time-consuming and there are no two-loop calculations which incorporate the effects\nof placing a baryon in a finite volume. With only a few terms of the expansion known for\ncertain, knowledge of the PCR of \u03c7 EFT is as important as knowledge of the expansion\nitself.\nNumerical simulations of QCD on a spacetime lattice are complemented by \u03c7 EFT\nthrough a model-independent formalism for connecting lattice simulation results to the\nphysical region. Simulations at finite volume and a variety of quark masses are related\n\n\fto the infinite-volume and physical quark masses through this formalism. However, it\nis accurate only within the PCR of the truncated expansion. In particular, truncated\nexpansions are typically applied to a wide range of quark (or pion) masses with little\nregard to a careful determination of the PCR.\nThrough the consideration of a variety of renormalization schemes and associated parameters, new techniques to identify the PCR have been established in Ref [3]. Consider\nthe nucleon mass: a benchmark for illustrating this approach.\n\nEFFECTIVE FIELD THEORY FOR NUCLEONS\nUsing the standard Gell-Mann\u2013Oakes\u2013Renner relation connecting quark and pion\nmasses, mq \u221d m2\u03c0 [4], the formal chiral expansion of the nucleon mass can be written as\nthe sum of a polynomial expansion in m\u03c02 and the meson-loop integral contributions:\nMN = {a0 + a2 m2\u03c0 + a4 m4\u03c0 + O(m6\u03c0 )} + \u03a3N + \u03a3\u2206 + \u03a3tad .\n\n(1)\n\nThe pion cloud corrections are considered in the heavy-baryon limit, with loop integrals, \u03a3N , \u03a3\u2206 and \u03a3tad . The coefficients ai of the analytic polynomial in Eq. (1) are\nrelated to the low energy constants of \u03c7 PT. In this investigation, they will be determined by fitting to lattice simulation results. These coefficients will be referred to as\nthe residual series coefficients. These bare coefficients undergo renormalization due to\ncontributions from the loop integrals \u03a3N , \u03a3\u2206 and \u03a3tad .\nUnder the most general considerations, each loop integral, when evaluated, produces\nan analytic polynomial in m2\u03c0 and non-analytic terms. Using finite-range regularization,\nexpanding out each integral yields:\n\n\u03c7N\nk2 u2 (k2 ; \u039b)\nN 2\n3\nN 4\n5\n= bN\n\u03a3N = 2 d3k\n(2)\n0 + b2 m\u03c0 + \u03c7N m\u03c0 + b4 m\u03c0 + O(m\u03c0 ) ,\n2\u03c0\n\u03c9 2 (k)\nZ\n\u03c7\u2206\n3\nm\u03c0\nk2 u2 (k2 ; \u039b)\n= b\u22060 + b\u22062 m2\u03c0 + b\u22064 m\u03c04 +\n\u03a3\u2206 = 2 d3k\n\u03c7\u2206 m\u03c04 log\n+ O(m\u03c05 ) ,\n2\u03c0\n\u03c9 (k) (\u2206 + \u03c9 (k))\n4\u03c0 \u2206\n\u03bc\n(3)\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010 1 Z\n\u0011\n2\n2\nm\u03c0\n2\nt\nt 2\nt 4\n4\n5\n3 2u (k ; \u039b)\n\u03a3tad = c2 m\u03c0 \u03c7t\n\u2212 b0 = c2 b2 m\u03c0 + b4 m\u03c0 + \u03c7t m\u03c0 log\n+ O(m\u03c0 ) ,\ndk\n4\u03c0\n\u03c9 (k)\n\u03bc\n(4)\nZ\n\nwhere u(k2 ; \u039b) is a regulator function\np described below. These integrals are expressed in\nterms of the pion energy \u03c9 (k) = k2 + m2\u03c0 and the delta-nucleon mass splitting \u2206. \u03c7N ,\n\u03c7\u2206 and \u03c7t denote the model-independent chiral coefficients of the terms that are nonanalytic in the quark mass. The bi coefficients are renormalization-scheme dependent,\nas are the ai coefficients.\nThe process of renormalization in finite-range regularized \u03c7 EFT proceeds by combining the renormalization-scheme dependent coefficients to provide the physical low\nenergy coefficients, which are denoted as ci . Thus, the nucleon mass expansion takes on\n\n\fthe standard form:\nMN = c0 + c2 m2\u03c0\n\n+ \u03c7N m\u03c03\n\n+ c4 m4\u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3\nm\u03c0\n+ \u2212\n\u03c7\u2206 + c2 \u03c7t m\u03c04 log\n+ O(m\u03c05 ) .\n4\u03c0 \u2206\n\u03bc\n\n(5)\n\nBy comparing Eqs. (1) and (5), the following renormalization procedure is obtained:\n\u2206\nc0 = a0 + bN\n0 + b0 ,\n\n(6)\n\nc2 =\n\n(7)\n\nc4 =\n\n\u2206\nt\na2 + bN\n2 + b2 + c2 b2 ,\n\u2206\nt\na4 + bN\n4 + b4 + c2 b4 ,\n\netc.\n\n(8)\n\nThe coefficients ci are scheme-independent quantities, and this property will be demonstrated when determined within the PCR.\nFor the purposes of this investigation, the regulator function u(k ; \u039b) is chosen to be a\ndipole form:\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22122\nk2\nu(k ; \u039b) = 1 + 2\n.\n(9)\n\u039b\nMore extensive discussions of different finite-range regulator functional forms can be\nfound in Refs [1, 5, 6, 7]. An analysis of results for the nucleon mass for a family of\ndipole-like forms is reported in Ref [3].\nIn order to accommodate the effect of the finite volume, the continuous loop integrals\nare transformed into a sum over discrete momentum values ki = ni 2\u03c0 /L, for integers\nni . The difference between a loop sum and its corresponding loop integral is the finitevolume correction, which should vanish for all integrals as m\u03c0 L becomes large [8].\n\nTHE INTRINSIC SCALE\nThe \u03c7 EFT extrapolation scheme will be used in conjunction with lattice QCD data from\nCP-PACS [9] and PACS-CS [10] to predict the nucleon mass MN for any value of m\u03c02 .\nWhen using lattice QCD results beyond the PCR, there is a scheme-dependence in the\nextrapolation. That is, the result of an extrapolation will be dependent on the choice\nof regulator. To demonstrate this, consider the infinite-volume extrapolation of the CPPACS data as the regularization scale is changed. Figure 1 shows that the extrapolations\ndiverge in the chiral regime, where the non-analytic behaviour of the loop integrals\ndominate.\n\nIdentification of the intrinsic scale: a toy model\nIs there a 'best' regularization scale indicated by lattice QCD data? By constructing\na toy model, a method is developed to identify an in-built scale by analyzing the\nlow energy coefficients. Ideal pseudodata is created with a known scale \u039bc , and an\nexamination of the renormalization flow of the low energy coefficients ci allows one\nto recover the value of the scale \u039bc .\n\n\fFIGURE 1. Left: example dipole extrapolation based on CP-PACS data [9], box size: 2.3 \u2212 2.8 fm.\nRight: close zoom of the regulator-dependence of the extrapolation.\n\nFIGURE 2. Left: Behaviour of c0 vs. \u039b. Right: Behaviour of c2 vs. \u039b. Both plots are based on infinitevolume pseudodata created with a dipole regulator at \u039bc = 1.0 GeV (based on lightest four data points\nfrom PACS-CS). Each curve follows from fits of Eq. (1) to pseudodata, with a different upper value of\npion mass m2\u03c0 ,max considered.\n\nBased on PACS-CS data, a dense and precise set of pseudodata is generated at infinite\nvolume and \u039bc = 1.0 GeV, entirely within the PCR. As the pseudodata are extended\nbeyond the PCR (by increasing m\u03c02 ,max ), a scale-dependence in the renormalization is\nrealized, as shown for c0 and c2 in Figure 2.\nHowever, the correct values of c0 and c2 (known by construction) are recovered at\nexactly \u039b = \u039bc , where the renormalization is independent of the range of m\u03c02 used. It\nis not correct in general to assume that the asymptotic value of ci at large \u039b is the best\nestimate of the true ci . Note that the intersection point is at the same value of \u039b for\nboth c0 and c2 . This indicates that the optimal regulator for the pseudodata is the value\n\u039b = \u039bc .\n\n\fFIGURE 3. Left: Behaviour of c0 vs. \u039b, based on CP-PACS data, to order O(m\u03c03 ). Right: Behaviour of\n\u03bc\nc0 vs. \u039b, based on QCDSF data, to order O(m\u03c0 ). In both plots a dipole regulator is used. A few points are\nselected to indicate the general size of the statistical error bars.\n\nLattice simulation results\nIn the toy model, a method was developed for extracting the intrinsic scale from some\nideal pseudodata. This leads one to ponder if actual lattice simulation results contain an\nintrinsic scale. Since lattice data usable for an extrapolation generally extend outside the\nPCR, an optimal regularization scale may be recovered. Renormalization flow curves\ncan be constructed for lattice simulation results by constraining the fit window with\nvarying values of m2\u03c0 ,max , sequentially including data points extending further outside\nthe PCR.\nThe results for the renormalization of the low energy coefficients c0 , the nucleon mass\n\u03bc\nin the chiral limit, and c0 , the magnetic moment of the nucleon in the chiral limit, are\nshown in Figure 3. Lattice simulation results from CP-PACS are used to analyze the\nnucleon mass, and preliminary results from QCDSF are used to analyze the magnetic\nmoment. Similar to the pseudodata case, a greater degree of regulator-dependence is\nobserved as more data are included in the fit. There is also a reasonably well defined\nregularization scale at which the renormalization of c0 is insensitive to the truncation of\nthe data. This indicates that there exists an optimal regularization scale embedded in the\nlattice simulation results themselves.\nIt is also intriguing that the optimal regularization scale obtained from independent\nlattice results for different observables is approximately the same value for the same\nregulator functional form. This suggests that the optimal regularization scale indicates\nthe existence of an intrinsic scale in the nucleon-pion interaction.\nA measure of the systematic uncertainty in the optimal regularization scale, evident in\nFigure 3, can be obtained by constructing a \u03c7 2 -style analysis. By plotting \u03c7 2 against the\nregularization scale \u039b, a measure of the spread of the renormalization flow curves can\nbe calculated, and the intersection point obtained. The corresponding \u03c7 2 (per degree of\nfreedom) plots are shown in Figure 4.\n\n\f2 vs. \u039b, for the renormalization flow of c to order O(m3 ), based on\nFIGURE 4.

In both plots a dipole regulator is used.\n\nSUMMARY\nUsing finite-range regularized chiral effective field theory, a technique for obtaining an\noptimal regularization scale from lattice results was demonstrated for pseudodata, in\naddition to actual simulation results for the nucleon mass and simulation results for the\nnucleon magnetic moment. By analyzing the renormalization flow of the low energy\ncoefficients with respect to \u039b, a step-wise extension of the data beyond the PCR allowed\nthe identification of an optimal regularization scale. This scale of approximately 1.2 GeV\nis the value at which the renormalization is least sensitive to truncation of the lattice data.\nLattice simulation results for the nucleon mass and nucleon magnetic moment yielded\nconsistent values for the optimal scale. Thus an intrinsic scale was uncovered, which\ncharacterizes the energy scale of the pion dressing of the nucleon.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis research is supported by the Australian Research Council.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nD.
