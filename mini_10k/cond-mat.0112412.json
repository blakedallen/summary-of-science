Our aim is to highlight the different behaviours as a consequence of the\nthermal treatments.

Introduction\n\nRuSr2GdCu2O8 ruthenocuprate (Ru-1212) belongs to a class of compounds that were synthesized\nfor the first time in 1995 [1]. It is characterised by a triple perovskitic cell similar to that of\nYBa2Cu3Ox, where Y and Ba are substituted by Gd and Sr, respectively, and the CuO2 planes are\nseparated from one another not by the Cu chains, but by RuO6 octahedra.\nThis first synthesis work yielded a material whose superconductivity, verified only through\nelectrical measurements, could not be undoubtedly attributed to the 1212 phase. Since the discovery\nof the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity in this class of materials, the efforts of\n\n1\n\n\fmany researchers have been focused on this phase. Nevertheless Chu et al. [2] still question about\nthe actual existence of bulk superconductivity.\nSince it is well known that physical properties are strongly dependent on sample preparation\nconditions, the critical point of all investigations on these materials is the preparation method. The\nneed to avoid the formation of impurities, such as the ferromagnetic SrRuO3 for example, and to\nobtain a phase as ordered as possible, led to the optimisation of a synthesis process that includes a\nfirst calcination, a thermal treatment in N2 [3,4] and several annealings in flowing O2 [4,5,6].\nReports of both superconducting [4,6] and non superconducting samples [7,8] of Ru-1212 have\nspurred a detailed experimental approach aimed to determine the factors that influence\nsuperconductivity of this material. Tackling the question of how the superconducting and magnetic\nproperties are affected by subtle details of the preparation process, which in turn affect the\nmicroscopic structure, we present the results of a systematic work on the synthesis of Ru-1212\nwhich allows superconductivity to be induced in a controlled manner.\n\n2. Experimental details\n\nPolycrystalline samples of composition RuSr2GdCu2O8 have been synthesized by solid state\nreaction of high purity stoichiometric powders of RuO2, Gd2O3, CuO and SrCO3. The mixture was\nfirst calcined in air at 950\u00b0C; then, after grinding and die-pressing into pellets, it was treated in\nflowing N2 atmosphere at 1010\u00b0C. This step resulted in the formation of a mixture of the precursor\nmaterials Sr2GdRuO6 and Cu2O without formation of the impurity phase SrRuO3, very stable in\noxidising environment [3]. The mixture was then subjected to eight successive sintering steps in\nflowing O2, each one lasting 15 hours, at temperatures starting from 1030\u00b0C up to 1085\u00b0C. Each\nsuccessive thermal treatment was performed at a temperature 7\u00b0C higher than the previous one. At\nthe end of every step the product was quenched to room temperature, fully characterized, reground,\npressed into pellets and subjected to the successive treatment at higher temperature, so that the\n2\n\n\feffects of the thermal treatments during synthesis process could be investigated. Each reaction step\nwas carried out on a MgO single crystal substrate to prevent reaction with the alumina crucible.\nThis procedure allowed us to highlight the passage from a non superconducting to a\nsuperconducting status in the material.\nIn this work, we report on the structural, electrical and magnetic properties of three samples\nconsidered indicative of the overall process of synthesis and formation of the Ru-1212 phase.\nParticularly those which were subjected to:\n(i)\n\nthree sintering steps up to 1045\u00b0C as follows: 1030\u00b0C x 15h + 1037\u00b0C x 15h + 1045\u00b0C x\n15h, for a total time t= (15 x 3) = 45h,\n\n(ii)\n\nfive sintering steps up to 1060\u00b0C for a total t = (15 x 5) = 75 h,\n\n(iii)\n\neight sintering steps up to 1085\u00b0C for a total t = (15 x 8) = 120 h;\n\nhereafter referred to as samples A, B and C, respectively.\nThe crystal structure of the samples was examined by X-ray powder diffraction using CuK\u03b1\nradiation. Micro-Raman analysis was carried out by a Renishaw System 2000 instrument (He-Ne\nlaser, 633 nm, 15mW, 50x, 4 accumulations). The resistivity of sintered polycrystalline bars was\nmeasured by the standard four-probe technique with a 1mA current in the 15 \u2013 300 K temperature\nrange. Magnetic susceptibility was measured in a Quantum Design SQUID magnetometer.\n\n3. Results and discussion\n\n3.1. Structure and microstructure\n\nXRD patterns showed single phase 1212-type materials with no traces of impurities within the\nresolution of the technique. All diffraction peaks could be indexed on the basis of a tetragonal\nlattice (Table 1) in agreement with the literature data [3]. In order to test the phase homogeneity\nfurtherly and due to its greater sensitivity with respect to XRD technique, micro-Raman analysis\n3\n\n\fhas been performed. The typical spectra obtained in three different points of sample B are reported\nin Fig. 1, where modest but detectable differences can be observed. The overall behaviour is in\nagreement with the literature data [9] showing the same structures of the peaks: the slight change of\nthe barycentre and band amplitude are presumably due to the different crystallinity between the\ncentre and the border of the sample. A broadening and a small shift toward lower frequency of the\npeak at 640 cm-1 (apical O(Sr) A1g mode) have been detected in A and C sample spectra which can\nbe related to a softening of the Sr-O bond. A comprehensive discussion and analysis of microRaman spectra in these compounds will be the subject of a future work.\nSEM analyses show high grain homogeneity with clean grain boundaries. Moreover, we have\ndetected a progressive grain growth with a corresponding increase in grain connectivity due to the\ndifferent thermal treatments. Complete sintering was never reached. This fact can be explained\nconsidering the difference between the decomposition temperature of the 1212 phase ( around\n1130\u00b0C, as estimated through thermal analysis) and the temperature of the thermal process (Tmax =\n1085\u00b0C in this work). The geometric density varies by about 5% between the first and the final bulk\n3\n\nsample C, which has a density of 4.2 g/cm (about 63% of the theoretical crystallographic density).\nIn order to investigate whether the observed behaviours were caused by the annealing time or\ntemperature, tests have been performed by comparing the properties of the samples obtained\nthrough the successive sintering steps mentioned above with other samples, of the same\ncomposition and batch, subjected to a single thermal treatment at the final temperature of each\nsingle step for a time which is the sum of the corresponding partial times of the serie considered in\nthis work. This allowed us to conclude that reaching the \"optimal\" temperature directly does not\nproduce the same results of the longer procedure: repeated homogenisations, related to the sequence\nof grinding and annealing, controls the superconducting behaviour.\n\n3.2. Electrical properties\n\n4\n\n\fThe behaviour of the room temperature resistivity as a function of the number of sintering steps n is\nreported in Fig. 2. It can be clearly seen that \u03c1300 has an almost constant value at the beginning of\nthe series, then it suddenly drops, reaching another constant value that is about six times smaller\nthan the starting one. Such different values are not related to the sample density, which does not\npresent strong variations. In the samples with n \u2264 4, a semiconductor-type behaviour (with a local\nminimum at 130K) is observed in the 50-300K temperature range. At higher n, a metallic type\nbehaviour is detected, with a well defined minimum at 130K followed by a semiconducting upturn.\nThe minimum at T=130 K is related to the onset of the magnetic ordering of Ru lattice. Moreover,\nfor n<4 a maximum in resistivity is observed at 35K, which is progressively depressed in magnitude\nand shifted up to 45K at higher n. At lower temperatures a large resistivity drop (down to values\n100 times smaller than \u03c1300) is measured for all samples with n<4. At higher n superconductivity\nsets in and zero resistivity is detected. In view of this trend in resistivity we limit our treatment to\nsample A (n=3), whose behaviour lies in the non superconducting and semiconductive region, to\nsample B (n=5), for which superconductivity and metallic character in resistivity have just set in,\nand to sample C (n=8), for which superconductivity has been depressed. Resistivity measurements\nperformed on these three samples are reported in Fig. 3. The temperature derivative of the\nresistivity for sample B is shown in the inset of Fig.3. A two-step behaviour is observed: a high\ntemperature peak at about 45K, corresponding to the superconducting thermodynamic critical\ntemperature, and another one at lower temperature (here at about 30K). This behaviour is\ncommonly observed in the literature: different explanations have been proposed [10,11].\n\n3.3. Magnetic properties\n\nAn experimental problem encountered in the magnetic measurements of Ru-1212 materials is\nstrictly related to the complexity of the magnetic signal. As noted in [12], the magnetization in Ru-\n\n5\n\n\f1212 contains magnetic moments arising from different contributions: the Gd paramagnetic spin\nlattice, the Ru spin lattice and, finally, the diamagnetic signal related to the superconducting\nbehaviour. For both the Gd and Ru spin lattice the antiferromagnetic ordering is coupled with a\nferromagnetic component that is attributed to a canting of the lattice, in the case of Ru, whereas, in\nthe case of Gd, is simply related to the presence of the net ferromagnetic moment of the Ru lattice\n[13]. Therefore, the basic condition of a homogeneous magnetic moment requested by the SQUID\nmagnetometer is not fulfilled, in particular at low temperatures where magnetic moments of\nopposite polarity will be present in the sample as a consequence of the applied field. In addition, in\nthe superconducting coil of the magnetometer a small remanent field may be present. This last can\nbe zeroed with a proper procedure which results in a residual field of the order of fraction of Gauss\n(estimated by measuring the susceptibility of a paramagnetic salt) in the central part of the magnet,\nand greater far from it. Therefore, a \"real\" ZFC measurement cannot be made and, since the FC\nmagnetic moment is about one order of magnitude greater than the ZFC one, even a residual field of\na fraction of Gauss may give rise to a considerable magnetic signal whose polarity depends on the\nfield polarity. Finally, we point out that, when the sample is moved for a length that is usually of\nfew centimetres during the measurement, it moves in a non uniform magnetic field that makes it\nfollow a minor hysteresis loop. If the value of the moment is not constant during the scan, an\nasymmetric scan wave form will be detected, and the quality of the measurement will drastically\ndegrade [14].\nThe ZFC and FC measurements are reported in Fig. 4 a) and b). The magnetic ordering manifests\nitself as a cusp related to an antiferromagnetic ordering in the ZFC measurement, whereas, in the\nFC curve, as a sudden onset of a spontaneous magnetic moment related to a ferromagnetic\ncomponent. For all three samples the spontaneous magnetization occurs in the 130-135K\ntemperature range. At the lowest temperatures a contribution from Gd sublattice, which orders\nantiferromagnetically at 2.5K, is clearly visible. The superconducting behaviour of sample B is\ndetected by the diamagnetic shift corresponding to the shielding of about 50% of sample volume at\n6\n\n\fthe lowest temperatures and fields. Measurements performed on sample B at different applied fields\nare shown in Fig. 4b). The FC susceptibility as well as the amplitude of the irreversibility between\nFC and ZFC measurements decreases as the field increases. At the minimum applied field of 0.2 G,\nand to a minor extent even at 1.2 G, a Meissner behaviour is seen in the FC curve that quickly reenters. At 5.5 G the Meissner effect is only seen as a constant value hindering the Gd magnetic\nordering. The poor visibility of the Meissner effect has been observed by several authors [10,15]\nand explained in different ways: Bernhard et al. [10] have proposed that a spontaneous\nmagnetisation from RuO2 layers results in a local magnetic field that may be greater than the lower\ncritical field Hc1 giving rise to a spontaneous vortex phase (SVP). The effect of a SVP is to suppress\nthe Meissner phase. Chu et al [15] have associated this behaviour to a phase-lock of an aggregation\nof small Josephson-coupled superconducting grains or domains.\nIn Fig. 5 the high temperature susceptibility data at 1000 G are reported. The best fit to the\nexperimental data with a two components curve \u03c7=CGd/T +CRu/(T-\u03b8) is shown and the fitting\nresults are reported in Table 1. Shown in the inset is the M(H) curve measured at 5K. With our\nmaximum available field, saturation of the magnetisation is not achieved.\n\nConclusions\n\nIt has been demonstrated that bulk superconductivity can also be obtained in quenched\nRuSr2GdCu2O8 samples. Superconductivity, as probed by magnetic susceptibility, is observed after\nproper homogenisation. At the higher temperatures (T>1070\u00b0C) the annealing tends to introduce\ndisorder in the system, worsening the superconducting properties.\nIn properly homogenised samples we have been able to observe a 50% sample volume shielding\nand a magnetic signal related to a Meissner effect.\n\n7\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nThis work was partially supported by INFM and CNR.\n\n8\n\n\fReferences\n\n[1] L.
