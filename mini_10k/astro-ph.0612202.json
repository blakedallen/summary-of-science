The extensive spectroscopic dataset available for these clusters allows us to determine the\ncluster K-band luminosity function and density profile without the need for statistical background\nsubtraction. The luminosity density and number density profiles can be described by NFW models\nwith concentration parameters of cl = 4.28 \u00b1 0.70 and cg = 4.13 \u00b1 0.57 respectively. Comparing\nthese to the dynamical mass analysis of the same clusters shows that the galaxy luminosity and\nnumber density profiles are similar to the dark matter profile, and are not less concentrated like\nin local clusters. The luminosity functions show that the evolution of K\u2217 over the redshift range\n0.2 < z < 0.5 is consistent with a scenario where the majority of stars in cluster galaxies form at\nhigh-redshift (zf > 1.5) and evolve passively thereafter. The best-fit for the faint-end slope of the\nluminosity function is \u03b1 = -0.84 \u00b1 0.08, which indicates that it does not evolve between z = 0 and z\n= 0.3. Using Principal Component Analysis of the spectra we classify cluster galaxies as either starforming/recently-star-forming (EM+BAL) or non-starforming (ELL) and compute their respective\nluminosity functions. The faint-end slope of the ELL luminosity function is much shallower than for\nthe EM+BAL galaxies at z = 0.3, and suggests the number of faint ELL galaxies in clusters decreases\nby a factor of \u223c 3 from z = 0 to z = 0.3. The redshift evolution of K\u2217 for both EM+BAL and\nELL types is consistent with a passively evolving stellar population formed at high-redshift. Passive\nevolution in both classes, as well as the total cluster luminosity function, demonstrates that the\nbulk of the stellar population in all bright cluster galaxies is formed at high-redshift and subsequent\ntransformations in morphology/color/spectral-type have little effect on the total stellar mass.\nSubject headings: cosmology: dark matter \u2212 large-scale structure of universe\ngalaxies: clusters: photometry \u2212 fundamental parameters\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nGalaxy clusters are fundamental tools in the study of\ngalaxy evolution because they are unique locations in the\nuniverse, where the high-density environment produces\na population of galaxies that is different from the general field. The ability to predict how and when cluster\ngalaxies are assembled, and their subsequent evolution\n1 Visiting Astronomer, Kitt Peak National Observatory, National Optical Astronomy Observatory, which is operated by\nthe Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc.\n(AURA) under cooperative agreement with the National Science\nFoundation.\n\nis an important test for any model of galaxy formation.\nUnfortunately, the cluster population transforms significantly in morphology, color, and star-formation properties over the redshift range 0 < z < 0.5 and thus far, our\nunderstanding of this evolution is incomplete. At low\nredshift (z < 0.2), clusters are primarily composed of a\npopulation of quiescent early-type galaxies which obey\na tight color-magnitude relation (CMR, e.g., Bower et\nal. 1992; Lopez-Cruz et al. 2004), morphology-density\nrelation (Dressler 1980; Goto et al. 2003a), and spectral\ntype-density relation (Tanaka et al. 2004; Gomez et al.\n2003; Lewis et al. 2002).\n\n\f2\n\nNIR Properties of Moderate-Redshift Galaxy Clusters\n\nAt higher redshifts (0.2 < z < 0.5) the cluster galaxy\npopulation is no longer completely dominated by earlytypes. The number of blue galaxies in clusters increases\n(the Butcher-Oemler effect, e.g., Butcher & Oemler 1984;\nEllingson et al. 2001; Andreon et al. 2004) and the morphological mix of galaxies also changes as the proportion\nof spiral galaxies increases at the expense of the earlytype (primarily S0) population (e.g., Dressler et al. 1997;\nPostman et al. 2005; Smith et al. 2005). Despite these\nmajor changes in star-formation properties and morphology, studies of the fundamental plane (e.g., van Dokkum\net al. 1998; van Dokkum & Stanford 2003; Holden et al.\n2005) and the CMR (e.g., Stanford et al. 1998; Gladders\net al. 1998; Holden et al. 2004) of early-type galaxies (both of which include S0 galaxies) show that their\nstellar populations are extremely old and consistent with\na passively evolving population formed at high redshift\n(zf > 2-3). The differences in the star-formation history\nof cluster galaxies and the average age of their stellar\npopulations could be reconciled by postulating that the\npredecessors of low-redshift early-types are high-redshift\nlate-types which form the bulk of their stars at highredshift (van Dokkum et al. 2001). If transformations\nin color and morphology are primarily passive (i.e., from\nthe truncation of star formation by strangulation; e.g.,\nBalogh et al. 1999; Abraham et al. 1996; Treu et al.\n2003; Goto et al. 2003b) then they should leave little\nimprint on the overall stellar population. The prediction\nthat the majority of evolution in cluster galaxies from\nz \u223c 0.5 to the present is simply the passive transformation of late-type galaxies into early-type galaxies is in\ngood qualitative agreement with the data; however, it is\npossibly too simplistic a picture.\nRecent work suggests that galaxy-galaxy mergers may\nplay a significant role in driving cluster galaxy evolution at high redshift. Lin et al. (2004, hereafter L04)\ncompared the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD, the\nnumber of galaxies in a dark matter halo of a given mass)\nof 0.2 < z < 0.9 clusters to that of z < 0.1 clusters\nand showed that it is larger by a factor of \u223c 2 in the\nhigh-redshift clusters. This result implies that numerous\nmergers or tidal disruptions in the cluster environment\nat moderate to high redshift are required to reduce the\nnumber of bright cluster galaxies, and match the local\nHOD. The prediction of a large merger fraction is consistent with observations of MS1054-03 at z = 0.83 by\nTran et al. (2005) and van Dokkum et al. (1999) who\nshow that 16% of the cluster galaxies are currently undergoing major mergers. Understanding how the merger\nrate interplays with the transformation in color, spectraltype, and morphological-type of the cluster population\nwithout significantly altering the overall stellar population remains a challenge.\nThe K-band luminosity function (LF) of clusters at this\nredshift can provide useful information on this problem.\nK-band light suffers little contamination from recent star\nformation and dust; furthermore, the K-corrections are\nsmall, negative, and nearly independent of galaxy type\n(e.g., Poggianti 1997; Mannucci et al. 2001). These advantageous properties mean that K-band light is closely\nrelated to the total stellar mass of a galaxy (Brinchmann\n& Ellis 2000; Rix & Rieke 1993) and therefore, the Kband LF is nearly analogous to the galaxy stellar mass\nfunction. The dependence on the stellar mass contained\n\nin galaxies makes the K-band LF a useful check on the\nmerger rate, because its evolution will proceed quite differently depending on the number of major mergers. Furthermore, the K-band LF is also sensitive to the age of\nthe stellar populations in cluster galaxies because it puts\nconstraints on luminosity evolution of the stellar population. Most commonly, luminosity functions are fit to a\nSchechter (1976) function of the form:\n\u03c6(K) = (0.4ln10)\u03c6\u2217 (100.4(K\n\n\u2217\n\n-K) 1+\u03b1\n\n)\n\nexp(\u2212100.4(K\n\n\u2217\n\n-K)\n\n),\n(1)\nwhere \u03b1 is the faint-end slope; \u03c6\u2217 , the normalization; and\nK\u2217 is the \"characteristic\" magnitude, which indicates the\ntransition between the power-law behavior of the faintend and the exponential behavior of the bright-end.\nThe advent of the 2 Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS,\nSkrutskie et al. 2006) has facilitated a considerable number of studies of the Near Infrared (NIR) LF of clusters\nin the local universe (i.e., z < 0.1) using a very homogeneous set of data. These studies now provide a crucial\ncomparison sample for higher-redshift NIR cluster LFs.\nBalogh et al. (2001, hereafter B01), Kochanek et al.\n(2003), Lin et al. (2003), L04, Rines et al. (2004, hereafter R04) and Ramella et al. (2004) have all investigated\nthe K-band LF of local clusters and groups using 2MASS\ndata. The LFs vary somewhat from sample to sample;\nhowever, it appears that the overall shape of the K-band\nLF in local clusters is similar to the local field. The\nonly notable difference being that K\u2217 is slightly (\u223c 0.2\n- 0.4 magnitudes) brighter in clusters, and K\u2217 in groups\nis closer to, if not equal, the field value (Ramella et al.\n2004; L04).\nAt higher redshift, the K-band LF of clusters is not as\nwell constrained. Thus far, the best measurement of the\nevolution of the cluster K-band LF comes from the study\nof de Propris et al. (1999, hereafter dP99). Using a heterogeneous set of 38 clusters with 0.1 < z < 1.0, they\nshow that the brightening of K\u2217 with increasing redshift\nis consistent with a passively evolving stellar population\nwith a formation redshift (zf ) of \u223c 2-3. Subsequent measurements of the K-band LF in a handful of z > 1 clusters\nhave been made (Kodama & Bower 2003; Ellis & Jones\n2004; Toft et al. 2004; Strazzullo et al. 2006) and those\ndata further confirm the passive evolution scenario. The\ninterpretation of these results has been that the majority of the stellar mass in bright cluster galaxies is already\nassembled into IR-bright (and therefore massive) galaxies by z \u223c 1. It is difficult to reconcile these data with\nthe prediction of a significant number of mergers in the\ncluster environment.\nWe have obtained wide-field K-band imaging for 15 of\nthe 16 CNOC1 clusters (Yee et al. 1996a) to a depth\nof \u223c K\u2217 + 2. With these data we examine the redshift\nevolution of the K-band cluster LF, the difference between the field and cluster LFs, the LFs of clusters of\ndifferent mass, and the K-band luminosity and number\ndensity profile of clusters at 0.19 < z < 0.54 using a\nhomogeneous, X-ray-selected cluster sample. We have\nIR-imaging and spectroscopy to R \u223c 1.5R200 for most\nclusters and this radial coverage allows us to compute\nthe LFs for the entire virialized region without the need\nfor statistical background subtraction. Furthermore, the\nspectroscopy also allows us to classify the galaxies into\nstar-forming, and non-star-forming types and determine\n\n\fMuzzin et al.\nhow the LFs of these classes differ.\nThis paper is the first in a series of three which examine the NIR properties of moderate redshift clusters. The HOD, mass-to-light ratios and correlation between the cluster physical properties and K-band luminosity/richness are presented in Muzzin et al. (2006,\nhereafter Paper II). The evolution of the color-magnitude\nrelation and the K-band selected Butcher-Oemler effect\nwill be presented in a third paper (Yee et al. in-prep,\nhereafter Paper III).\nThe structure of this paper is as follows: In \u00a72 we\ndescribe our observations, and in \u00a73 the data reduction\nand calibration. Section 4 discusses the weighting scheme\nbased on the spectroscopic catalogue that is used to construct both the density profiles and luminosity functions.\nIn \u00a75 we compute the K-band luminosity and number\ndensity profile of the clusters and compare with the dark\nmatter profile. In \u00a76 we determine the cluster K-band\nLF for all cluster galaxies as a function of redshift and\ncluster mass and compare to field LFs in the literature.\nIn \u00a77 we divide the galaxies into two spectral classes and\nshow the dependence of these LFs on redshift and cluster\nmass. We conclude with a summary in \u00a78. When computing magnitudes and angular sizes we adopt an \u03a9m\n= 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, H0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc \u22121 cosmology.\nAll magnitudes quoted throughout the paper are on the\nVega system.\n2. OBSERVATIONS\n\nThe CNOC1 clusters are an X-ray selected sample of\n16 intermediate (0.19 < z < 0.54) redshift clusters (Yee\net al. 1996a), and are likely the most well-studied clusters in this redshift range. The masses (Carlberg et al.\n1996, Borgani et al. 1999), mass-profiles (Carlberg et al.\n1997a, 1997b; van der Marel et al. 2000), X-ray temperatures (Mushotzky & Scharf 1997; Henry 2000; Lewis et\nal. 1999; Hicks et al. 2006), X-ray luminosities (Ellis\n& Jones 2002), richnesses (Yee & Ellingson 2003), and\nstellar populations (Abraham et al. 1996; Balogh et al.\n1999; Diaferio et al. 2001; Ellingson et al. 2001) have\nall been examined in detail. For our sample we selected\n15 of the 16 CNOC1 clusters for K-band imaging. The\ncluster MS0906+11 was not observed because it is was\nshown to be a strong binary in redshift-space by Carlberg et al. (1996) and therefore the cluster dynamical\nmass measurement is unreliable.\n2.1. Optical Photometry and Spectroscopy\n\nGunn g and r band imaging data were obtained at\nthe 3.6m Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope (CFHT) as\npart of the original CNOC1 project (Yee et al. 1996a)\nusing the Multi-Object Spectrograph (MOS) camera in\nimaging mode. The 5\u03c3 depth of the optical photometry varies from cluster-to-cluster but is typically 23.7 24.3 mag in g, and 23.5 - 24.0 mag in r. The CNOC1\nproject also acquired > 2500 spectroscopic redshifts in\nthe fields of the 15 clusters. The spectroscopy was obtained using 1-10 masks of \u223c 100 slits per cluster. Of the\n2500 redshifts, approximately half are cluster members.\nThe spectroscopic catalogues were chosen as an r-band\nmagnitude-limited, complete sample, but are sparsely\nsampled. The spectroscopic magnitude limits are r =\n20.5, 21.5, and 22.0 for clusters at z < 0.3, 0.3 < z <\n0.45, and z > 0.45 respectively. Using the passive evo-\n\n3\n\nlution color-redshift model for an early-type galaxy from\nKodama et al. (1998), these spectroscopic completeness\nlimits correspond to K-band limits of \u223c 17.0, 17.5, and\n18.0 mag for the same redshift bins. The definition of\nthe completeness limiting magnitude is that all galaxies\nbrighter than the limit, that had slits placed on them,\nhave reliably determined redshifts. However, the sparse\nsampling means that not all galaxies in the field brighter\nthan the completeness limit had slits placed on them.\nTherefore, use of the redshift catalogues requires a selection function that corrects for the sparse sampling of the\ndata (\u00a74).\nComplete details of the optical observations, reductions, photometry and redshift determination of these\ndata can be found in Yee et al. (1996a). Our analysis\nis based on the original photometric and spectroscopic\ncatalogues (Ellingson et al. 1998, 1997; Abraham et al.\n1998; Yee et al. 1998, 1996b) and additional unpublished\nspectroscopy for z < 0.3 clusters.\n2.2. Near Infrared Observations\n\nK-band imaging for 14 of the 15 clusters was obtained\nat the Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) 2.1m\ntelescope using the Ohio State / NOAO Infrared Imaging Spectrograph (ONIS). The ONIS detector is a 1024 \u00d7\n1024 InSb array with 2 working quadrants which makes\nit effectively a 1024 \u00d7 512 imager with a pixel scale of\n0.\u2032\u2032 288/pixel. The observations were made on UT 1999\nFebruary 3-4 and 1999 June 3, and were taken in a\nMauna Kea Observatory filter set version of the Ks filter\n(Tokunaga et al. 2002), which is nearly identical to the\n2MASS Ks filter. Hereafter we treat them as identical\nand refer to the filter simply as the \"K-band\". All three\nnights were photometric and standard stars were observed at different airmasses for photometric calibration.\nThe seeing in the images is typically around 1.\u2032\u2032 0, but\nranges from 0.\u2032\u2032 8 to 1.\u2032\u2032 2. Because of time constraints, we\nwere unable to obtain data for one cluster (MS0440+02)\nduring the February run. K-band imaging of MS0440+02\nwas instead obtained using the PISCES camera on the\nKPNO 2.5m telescope on UT 1999 February 27 during\nan imaging run for CNOC2 fields. The PISCES camera\nis a 1024 \u00d7 1024 HAWAII array with a pixel scale of\n0.\u2032\u2032 495/pixel. The PISCES imaging was done using the\nKs filter. Table 1 summarizes our observational data.\n2.3. Pointing Strategy and Field Coverage\n\nThe goal of the original CNOC1 observations was to\nobtain photometry and spectroscopic redshifts of cluster\nmembers beyond the cluster virial radius (Rvir ), in order to determine the cluster dynamical mass-to-light ratio. For the massive, lower-redshift clusters, the angular\nsize of Rvir was larger than the CFHT-MOS Field-ofView (FOV) (\u223c 10\u2032 \u00d7 10\u2032 ) and several MOS pointings\nwere required. For these clusters, either a north-south or\neast-west strip through the cluster center was observed.\nColumn 8 of Table 1 lists the configuration of the MOS\npointings. The first number in the column is the number\nof east-west pointings and the second is the number of\nnorth-south pointings. A 1 \u00d7 1 pointing is the cluster\ncenter. Column 9 lists what percentage of the area of\na circle with radius R200 , the radius at which the mean\ndensity of the cluster exceeds the critical density by a\nfactor of 200 (see Paper II for updated values of R200\n\n\f4\n\nNIR Properties of Moderate-Redshift Galaxy Clusters\n\nfor the CNOC1 clusters using a \u039bCDM cosmology), is\ncovered by the optical imaging data. Column 3 of Table 1 lists the number of cluster members (see Carlberg\net al. 1996 for membership criteria) with spectroscopic\nredshifts within R200 .\nIn order to overlap as much of the optical imaging and\nspectroscopic data as possible, we designed a pointing\nstrategy for the ONIS observations based on the locations of the CFHT MOS fields. To obtain images with\nsimilar coverage as the \u223c 10\u2032 \u00d7 10\u2032 CFHT MOS (although only \u223c 8\u2032 \u00d7 8\u2032 are useful for photometry and\nspectroscopy due to a significant radial distortion and\nvignetting) using the \u223c 2.5\u2032 \u00d7 5\u2032 FOV of ONIS we used\na 3 \u00d7 2 pointing pattern for each MOS field. This gives\nus an ONIS mosaic with a FOV of \u223c 7.5\u2032 \u00d7 7.5\u2032 , which is\nsimilar to the usable portion of the MOS. Each pointing\nconsists of \u223c 4 dithers of \u223c 6\u2032\u2032 to 10\u2032\u2032 , and each dither\nconsists of 1-3 internal coadds with exposure times of 2545 seconds. The nature of the mosaicking is such that\nthere is significant overlap of the pointings in the northsouth direction and a strip in the center of each field has\na higher signal-to-noise than the rest of the mosaic. The\ndepth of the images at the lower signal-to-noise parts\nstill reaches the limit of the spectroscopic observations,\nso we make no correction for the slightly uneven depth\nof the images. The PISCES camera has a FOV of 8\u2032\n\u00d7 8\u2032 , nearly the same size as the MOS, and therefore we\nmade a single PISCES pointing for each MOS pointing in\nMS0440+02. The PISCES pointings consist of 5 dithers\nof \u223c 5\u2032\u2032 with a 40 second exposure time.\n3. DATA REDUCTION\n\nReduction of the ONIS data was done using the IRAF\npackages PHIIRS and PHAT (see Hall, Green, & Cohen,\n1998). Reduction of the PISCES data was done with a\nmodified version of the ipipe reduction package (Gilbank\net al., 2003). Both of these packages employ the standard techniques for reducing NIR imaging, and here we\nsummarize only the most important steps in the process.\nThe first step in the reduction is to make a first-pass\ndark subtraction, flat-fielding, and sky estimate for all\nframes. Frames are then registered and coadded into\na first-pass mosaic of the cluster. Object finding is performed on this mosaic, and from this an \"object mask\" is\nmade. Flat-fielding and sky subtraction are then redone\nusing only pixels that do not appear in the the object\nmask. This step ensures that faint galaxies not detected\nin a single frame do not cause the sky level to be overestimated.\nAll ONIS images are flattened with dome flats (for the\nPISCES images we use the value of the sky itself to flatfield). Whenever possible, sky subtraction is done using a \"running sky\". This procedure involves calculating\nthe sky from a fixed number of frames taken before and\nafter the frame for which the sky is being subtracted.\nDetermining the sky from a small number of frames improves the photometric accuracy of the data because the\nmoderate-duration sky variations (of the order 10 minutes in the NIR) can be removed accurately. Unfortunately, using a small number of frames to compute the\nsky also results in a larger Root-Mean-Squared (RMS)\nbackground in the final mosaic because shot noise is significant when using only a few frames. Our criteria for\nchoosing the best number of frames for sky subtraction\n\nwas as follows: The sky was first computed using all the\nframes from a cluster (we termed this a \"quick sky\").\nThe quick sky was subtracted from all frames, and the\nfinal mosaic made. The RMS noise and standard deviation of that image are then recorded. We then repeat sky\nsubtraction using the running sky technique. The final\nsky we adopt is the one that uses the fewest number of\nframes and gets an RMS background for the final image\nthat is within 1\u03c3 of the quick sky image. For most clusters this results in a sky computed from \u223c 16-32 frames\n(i.e., approximately 5 - 10 minutes before and after each\nframe was observed). Once the final sky has been subtracted from each frame, we adopt an airmass extinction\nterm of -0.08 mag for the K-band, and all frames are\nrescaled by 1.08 \u00d7 <airmass> of the observation. As an\nexample of the data quality, we show a portion of the\nfinal mosaics of one of the highest-redshift (MS0016+16)\nand lowest-redshift (Abell 2390) clusters in the sample\nin Figures 1 & 2.\n3.1. ONIS Pattern Removal\n\nAll frames obtained using the ONIS instrument have\na lined pattern that appears in the bottom-half of the\nimage. This pattern is probably caused by extra noise\ngenerated when the camera is read out. The pattern\nis well-fit by a variable-amplitude sinusoid curve with\na period 6 times the width of the chip. We remove the\npattern by fitting each original frame (before flat-fielding\nand sky subtraction) with a sinusoid and then subtracting the fit from the image. In all cases the fits are good\nand all images are subsequently eye-checked to make sure\nnothing which might significantly alter the photometry\nis subtracted. The final mosaic for each cluster is made\nfrom the final sky-subtracted, pattern-removed frames.\n3.2. PISCES Distortion Correction\n\nThe PISCES camera has a radial distortion in the focal plane. The pattern is different each time the camera\nis mounted on the telescope and therefore must be corrected using stars in the science images. We correct this\npattern using code developed by McCarthy et al. (2001).\nComparing the positions of objects on the optical images\nwith the distortion-corrected PISCES images shows that\nthis correction works extremely well.\n3.3. Object Finding and Photometry\n\nThe g and r-band optical images are significantly\ndeeper than the K-band images for every cluster. Therefore we match the optical catalogue positions to the Kband images using the IRAF task xyxymatch. The significant pincushion of the CFHT-MOS is corrected using\ntabulated data supplied by CFHT. In most cases this allows for excellent matches of the whole optical catalogue.\nIn the few cases where a slight offset remains, a higher\norder correction is computed and then eye checked. A\nfinal eye check is made for objects that may have been\nso red as to be apparent only in the K-band images.\nVery few such objects were found (\u223c 1-2 per MOS field).\nThose that are found are not faint Extremely Red Objects (EROs); they tend to be objects undetected in the\noptical image because they are obscured by the bleeding\nof charge from a saturated star. No attempt is made\nto account for these objects because there are so few.\n\n\fMuzzin et al.\n\n5\n\nFig. 1.- K-band image of the central region of MS0016+16 (z = 0.55), one of the highest-redshift clusters in the sample. The image\nhas a FOV of 3.5 \u00d7 3.0 arcmin, and seeing of 1.\u2032\u2032 1. North is to the top, east is to the left.\n\nFurthermore, these galaxies do not have redshifts and\ntherefore will have negligible impact on the results of the\nstudy.\nPhotometry and star-galaxy classification are done on\nall objects using Picture Processing Package (PPP, Yee\n1991). PPP identifies objects as either stars or galaxies based on analysis of their growth curve. The r-band\nimages are the deepest for all clusters and therefore the\nobject classification is based exclusively on the r-band\nimages.\nGalaxy colors are nominally computed using a 3\u2032\u2032 diameter aperture magnitude. However, PPP determines\nwhether this aperture is appropriate based on the object's growth curve. If the growth curve appears \"normal\" (i.e., it is monotonically increasing, but has a monotonically decreasing derivative) then an actual 3\u2032\u2032 aperture is used; however, if the growth curve is abnormal\n(due to, e.g., crowding from another object, or a cosmic\nray hit) PPP uses the largest, non-contaminated aperture to compute the color (we refer to this diameter as\nthe optimal aperture, dopt ). Computing colors using this\ntechnique is particularly useful for avoiding the crowding\nproblems which can be significant in the dense, central\nparts of galaxy clusters.\nGalaxy total magnitudes are determined by analyzing\n\nthe shape of the growth curve. For faint small galaxies\n(r > 19) the magnitudes are extrapolated to a diameter\nof 8.5\u2032\u2032 to account for seeing effects. The extrapolation\nis done using a reference Point Spread Function (PSF),\ndetermined from several bright stars in the field. For\nbrighter galaxies (r < 19), variable apertures up to a\nmaximum of 25.5\u2032\u2032 are used. The size of the aperture is\ndetermined from the growth curve of the object. This\nstep is primarily employed to account for bright galaxies\nwith large angular diameters (i.e., foreground galaxies).\nA thorough discussion of photometry using PPP and a\ncomparison with simulations can be found in Yee (1991).\n3.4. Photometric Calibration and Comparison with\n\nPrevious Photometry\nPhotometric standards from Persson et al. (1998) were\nobserved throughout all nights, at different airmasses.\nThere are not enough standards to solve for the atmospheric extinction coefficient; however, comparing observations of the same standard at different air masses shows\nthat they are consistent with -0.08 value assumed for the\nscience frames. Standards taken throughout the night\nwere extremely stable, so photometric zeropoints are determined for each night based on an average of all standards for that night. The standard deviations in the zeropoint calibration for the three ONIS nights are 0.022,\n\n\f6\n\nNIR Properties of Moderate-Redshift Galaxy Clusters\n\nFig. 2.- K-band image of the central region of Abell 2390 (z = 0.22), one of the lowest-redshift clusters in the sample. The image has\na FOV of \u223c 2.5 \u00d7 3.5 arcmin, and seeing of 1.\u2032\u2032 2. North is to the left, east is to the bottom.\n\n0.014, and 0.035 mag, and are determined from 3, 10,\nand 6 standard stars respectively. The PISCES photometric zeropoint has a standard deviation of 0.022 mag\nand is determined from 4 standard stars.\nThe cluster imaging is sufficiently wide that it contains\nenough bright stars per cluster field to check the consistency of the photometry with the 2MASS point-source\ncatalogue (Skrutskie et al. 2006). The 2MASS photometric calibration is excellent, having zeropoint variations that are less than 0.02 mag across the entire survey.\nFor the purpose of determining any differences in zeropoint, we compare the photometry of objects 13.5 < Ks\n< 15.0 classified as stars by PPP in the cluster fields to\nthe same objects in the 2MASS Point Source Catalogue.\nWe adopt a faint limit of Ks < 15.0 because the mean\nphotometric uncertainty for an individual star at Ks \u223c\n15 becomes fairly large in the 2MASS catalogue (\u223c 0.1\nmag). We choose a bright limit of Ks > 13.5 because\nstars begin to saturate at this magnitude on the ONIS\ndetector (the PISCES potential well is slightly deeper\nand therefore a bright limit of Ks = 12.5 is adopted for\nMS0440+02). The number of stars available for comparison in the fields of the clusters varies from from 6\nin MS1008-12 and MS1455+22 to 70 in Abell 2390. In\ngeneral, the agreement between our photometry and the\n\n2MASS photometry is good. Eight of 15 clusters have\nmedian photometric differences of < 0.05 mag, and 12 of\n15 have differences of < 0.1 mag. The cluster with the\nlargest offset is MS0016+16, which is fainter than the\n2MASS photometry by 0.18 mag. We noted the possibility of light cirrus in the logbook when observing this cluster, and assume that this is the explanation for the difference in zeropoint. Table 2 lists the clusters, the number\nof stars, and the mean difference between our photometry and the 2MASS photometry. Although the offsets\nbetween our calibration and the 2MASS calibration are\nsmall, we have chosen to recalibrate our photometry to\nthe 2MASS photometry, rather than use the solutions\nfrom the standard stars. This provides consistent photometric zeropoint for the entire cluster sample. Once\nrecalibration is complete, the magnitudes of all galaxies\nare corrected for Galactic reddening using the dust maps\nof Schlegel et al. (1998).\nThree of the CNOC1 clusters (MS1358+62, MS045103, and MS1008-12) were also observed in the study of\nStanford et al. (1998, 2002; hereafter SED02). As an\nadditional check on the consistency of our photometry,\nwe compare the magnitudes of all galaxies brighter than\nthe 5\u03c3 limiting depth of the shallowest observation (in\nall three cases our data is shallower by \u223c 0.1 mag). The\n\n\fMuzzin et al.\ntop panels of Figures 3, 4, and 5 show plots which compare our total magnitudes with the SED02 total magnitudes. The solid line in the plot has a slope of unity. The\nbottom panel of the plots shows the residuals. Overall,\nthe agreement between our photometry and the SED02\nphotometry is poor. The median offset for MS1008-12,\nMS1358+62, and MS0451-03 is 0.089, 0.223, and 0.305\nmag respectively, with our photometry being fainter in\nall cases. Objects which are extreme outliers (> 1 mag)\nare likely to be bad matches, as we use a relatively simple\nmatching technique.\nThe systematic differences in the photometry are much\nlarger than the zeropoint uncertainties (\u223c 0.02 mag for\n2MASS, and \u223c 0.03 mag for the SED02 data) and they\nare also larger than the even the largest difference between our own photometric calibration and the 2MASS\ncalibration (0.18 mag). This makes it difficult to understand the cause of the discrepancy. The data reduction procedure employed by SED02 is nearly identical\nto our own, and therefore it is unlikely that this causes\nany systematics between the datasets. The most notable\ndifference between the SED02 datasets and our own is\nthat the SED02 observations were done with different\ncameras on different telescopes: OSIRIS on KPNO 1.3m\nfor MS1008-12, IRIM on KPNO 2.1m for MS1358+62,\nand IRIM on KPNO 4m for MS0451-03 whereas ours\nwere done with the same instrument/telescope configuration. In our program, the observations for MS1008-12\nand MS1358+62 were taken consecutively on February 3.\nIf there were some systematic change during the observations (e.g., cirrus) it most likely would have affected\nboth of these clusters, yet the photometric calibration\nfrom the standard stars matches the 2MASS calibration\nfor both these clusters very well (<\u2206m> = -0.003 and\n-0.039, for MS1008-12 and MS1368+62, respectively).\nIt is interesting to note that the photometry for objects\nbrighter than K \u223c 15.0 agrees somewhat better than for\nobjects fainter than K \u223c 15. Given that our zeropoints\nare determined using stars brighter than this, it suggests\nthat the SED02 photometry could be as consistent with\nthe 2MASS photometry as our own, and that the relative offset is not a zeropointing problem, but may be\na systematic due to the different way magnitudes are\nmeasured. The cameras used by SED02 have a much\nlarger pixel scale than ONIS (0.\u2032\u2032 95/pixel, 1.\u2032\u2032 09/pixel,\n0.\u2032\u2032 65/pixel for OSIRIS, IRIM-2.1m, and IRIM-4m, respectively, compared to 0.\u2032\u2032 288/pixel for ONIS). Such a\nlarge pixel size means that the some of their observations may be significantly undersampled if the seeing\nwas close to 1.\u2032\u2032 0 or better. This could pose a problem\nbecause the SED02 magnitudes were measured using the\nFOCAS (Valdes, 1982) code, which determines magnitudes using isophotes. SED02 then correct the FOCAS\nmagnitudes because FOCAS tends to produce total magnitudes which are too faint. It is possible that determining isophotal magnitudes using undersampled data\nmay result in a significant scatter, because the location\nof the isophote is difficult to determine. We cannot be\ncertain that this is the source of the discrepancy over\nsuch a small area; however, because we use primarily a\nsingle instrument, and our photometry agrees well with\n2MASS photometry, we are confident of the photometric\naccuracy of our own data.\n\n7\n\nFig. 3.- Top Panel: Total magnitudes from the SED02 photometry vs. total magnitudes from this photometry for the cluster\nMS1008-12.

SPECTROSCOPIC SELECTION FUNCTION\n\nThe large number of spectroscopic redshifts available\nfrom the CNOC1 project allows us to measure the Kband LF and density profiles with more confidence than\nby statistical background subtraction; however, the cluster redshift catalogues are sparsely sampled and a weighting scheme is required to correct for the spectroscopic\n\n\f8\n\nNIR Properties of Moderate-Redshift Galaxy Clusters\n\nselection function. Galaxies may preferentially have a\nmeasured redshift depending on their magnitude, color,\nposition in the cluster, or z; and the galaxy weights are\na function of these four parameters.\nThe weighting scheme that is employed is based on the\none derived by the CNOC1 and CNOC2 collaborations\nand is discussed thoroughly in the respective papers (Yee\net al. 1996a, Yee et al. 2000). The basic philosophy\nbehind the weighting scheme is that the distribution of\ngalaxies with redshifts is representative of the ones without redshifts in terms of the primary selection biases.\nThe magnitude selection function (i.e., a brighter galaxy\nis more likely to have a spectroscopic redshift) is overwhelmingly dominant over the other 3 possible selection\neffects, which can be considered \"secondary effects\" (Yee\net al. 1996a). Incorporating the full set of weights in\nour computations has little effect on the final results and\nfor simplicity of interpretation we ignore the secondary\nbiases and use only the magnitude weights when computing the cluster LFs.\nThe spectroscopic weights are computed as follows.\nGalaxies with redshifts are compared to the total number of galaxies in running bins of \u00b1 0.25 mag for galaxies\nfainter than K\u2217 + 1.5, and in running bins of \u00b1 0.50 mag\nfor galaxies brighter than K\u2217 + 1.5. K\u2217 for each cluster\nis estimated using a passive evolution model (\u00a76.3). The\nweight for a galaxy is then the inverse ratio of galaxies\nwith redshifts to the total number of galaxies in its magnitude bin. The weights for the brightest cluster galaxies\n(BCGs) are sometimes not equal to 1, even though the\nspectroscopy for the BCGs is 100% complete. This occurs because there are bright field galaxies within the\ncluster field. In order to avoid overestimating the contribution from bright galaxies, the spectroscopic weight of\nthe BCG in each cluster is set equal to 1.\nAll galaxies within the cluster field are used to compute the weights when we measure the cluster density\nprofiles. For the LFs, only galaxies within R200 are used\nto determine the weights. We adopt this approach for\nthe LFs because the K-band imaging does not have the\nsame coverage as the optical imaging/spectroscopy in all\nclusters. A few clusters have K-band data to only R\n\u223c R200 whereas others have coverage well beyond R200\nand therefore have a larger proportion of field galaxies\nwith redshifts. Throughout the analysis in this paper,\nthe determination of cluster membership is done using\nthe cluster redshift-space bounds calculated by Carlberg\net al. (1996).\nOne potentially serious problem with the spectroscopic\ncatalogue is that it is r-band selected, yet it is being used\nto determine the abundance of K-band selected galaxies. If a cluster or field contains a significant number\nof EROs which are redder than the cluster red-sequence\nthen they will be missing from the spectroscopic sample,\nand could artificially inflate the K-band spectroscopic\nweights. Although we already verified qualitatively that\nthere is not a significant number of EROs in the cluster field (\u00a73.3), one way to further confirm there is no\nbias in the r-band selected spectroscopic catalogue is to\ncompare the weights computed for the r-band data to the\nK-band weights. Figures 6 and 7 show plots of the r-band\nweights and K-band weights for the clusters MS1358+62\nand MS0302+16.

Spectroscopic\ncoverage of MS0302+16 is somewhat poor, however the distribution\nof K-band weights is still similar to the r-band weights.\n\nworst. The weight functions show the characteristic dip\nat bright magnitudes (r < 20, K < 16) and the gradual\nfall-off at fainter magnitudes. The dip at bright magnitudes occurs because most of the bright galaxies are\nclose together in the cluster core and getting slits on all\nof them is difficult, even with the multiple-mask strategy\nof CNOC1. The weight functions are similar between the\nK-band and r-band for both clusters, and this behavior\nis similar for all clusters in the sample. Therefore, we\nconclude that the r-selected spectroscopy is still representative of the K-band sample of galaxies.\n5. CLUSTER DENSITY PROFILES\n\nThe mass density profiles and r-band number density profiles for the CNOC1 clusters have already been\nmeasured using the spectroscopic dataset by several authors (Carlberg et al. 1997a, 1997b; van der Marel et\nal. 2000). Here we compute the K-band selected luminosity and number density profiles as a comparison\nto check whether K-band selected galaxies (which better trace stellar mass) produce profiles that are different\nfrom r-selected galaxies. Computing the luminosity and\nnumber density profiles also allows us to compare the\nK-band density profiles of the higher-redshift CNOC1\nclusters to the K-band density profiles of lower-redshift\nclusters (e.g., L04, R04).\nThe density profiles are constructed by stacking all 15\nclusters into an ensemble cluster. Before adding galaxies to the ensemble cluster the radius of each cluster is\nnormalized by its R200 . The number density profile is calculated by totaling the number of cluster galaxies with\nK < K\u2217 + 1 in circular shells, scaling each galaxy by its\nspectroscopic weight (\u00a74). The luminosity profile is computed in the same manner using the K-corrected, and\nevolution corrected (see \u00a76.1) luminosity of galaxies with\nK < K\u2217 + 1.\nThe clusters do not have homogeneous radial coverage\nand most are observed in a strip running through the\ncluster center. Therefore, the total counts or total luminosity in each shell is multiplied by the relative coverage\nof the shell before converting to a surface density. Some\n\n\fMuzzin et al.\nclusters also have coverage that extends to a larger R\nthan others. To reduce the noise at large R from poorly\nsampled clusters, the contribution from individual clusters is truncated at the radius where the actual coverage\nof the shell is less than 10% and each data point in the\nensemble cluster is weighted by the number of clusters\nthat contribute to it. The data for the ensemble cluster\nextends to 1.5R200 .\nIn the top panel of Figure 8 we plot the cluster number density profile (including the BCGs) and in the bottom panel we plot the luminosity density profile (excluding the BCGs). The data are fit to a projected NFW\n(Navarro et al. 1997) profile of the form derived by Lokas\n& Mamon (2001)\n\u03a3(R) = Ac2 g(c)\n\n1 \u2212 |x2 \u2212 1|\u22121/2 C \u22121 (1/x)\n,\n(x2 \u2212 1)2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere c is the concentration parameter, x \u2261 R/rs and\ng(c) = [ln(1 + c) \u2212 c/(1 + c)]\u22121 ,\n\u001a\ncos\u22121 (x)\nif R > rs\n\u22121\nC (x) =\ncosh\u22121 (x)\nif R < rs .\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nThe parameters A and c are fit using the LevenbergMarquardt least-squares technique for \u03c72 -minimization\n(Press et al. 1992). The best fit concentration parameter for the galaxy number density profile is cg = 4.13 \u00b1\n0.57. This agrees well with the cg = 3.7 calculated by\nCarlberg et al. (1997b) using the r-band photometry. It\nis also similar to the best-fit concentration of the K-band\nluminosity profile, cl = 4.23 \u00b1 0.70.\nInterestingly, a good fit for the luminosity profile can\nonly be obtained when the luminosity of the BCGs is\nexcluded. The asterisk in the bottom panel of Figure 8\nshows the value of the central point in the luminosity\ndensity with the BCGs included. This central part is\nbetter described by a power-law fit (dashed line) with an\nindex of n = -1.38 \u00b1 0.03. The power-law can describe\nthe luminosity profile with BCGs included approximately\nas well as the NFW profile does with the BCGs removed\n(reduced-\u03c72 = 2.97 and 2.79 respectively). It is perhaps\nsurprising that the number density profile can be described by an NFW profile when the BCGs are included,\nbut the luminosity density profile can only be fit when the\nBCGs are removed. This illustrates the unique nature of\nthe BCG luminosity in the context of the formation of\nlarge-scale structure. The distribution of K-band light\nclosely follows the distribution of K-band-selected halos\nthroughout the cluster which suggests the average luminosity per halo is roughly constant for cluster galaxies,\nexcept the central galaxy which is by far the brightest\ngalaxy residing in a single halo. This is also intuitively\nsupported by the cluster LFs (\u00a76 & \u00a77) where the luminosity distribution of cluster galaxies is well-fit by a\nSchechter function, except for the BCGs which are much\nbrighter than the rest of the population and are more\nabundant than a Schechter function would predict.\nHow do the luminosity and number density profiles\ncompare to the cluster mass profiles? van der Marel et al.\n(2000) computed the mass profile of the CNOC1 clusters\nwith detailed Jeans equation analysis. They showed that\na variety of generalized density profiles fit these data well,\nwith the best-fitting NFW model having cDM = 4.17 (unfortunately, no error-bar is quoted for this value). This\n\n9\n\nis nearly identical to the concentration of the K-band\nnumber and luminosity density profiles and suggests that\nboth the stellar mass contained in galaxies (excluding the\nBCGs) and the stellar-mass selected subhalo population,\ntightly trace the dark matter mass. The same conclusion was made by both Carlberg et al. (1997b) and van\nder Marel et al. (2000) using the r-band selected number density. However, if the BCGs are included in the\nluminosity profile, it appears that stellar mass may dominate over dark matter in the cluster core. The same\ntrend is seen by Sand et al. (2004) using a sample of\n6 clusters in the same redshift range (0.17 < z < 0.44)\nselected for having radial arcs. Sand et al. (2004) use a\ncombination of strong-lensing, BCG velocity distribution\nand BCG luminosity to model the ratio of luminous and\ndark matter in cluster cores. Unfortunately, the K-band\nphotometry and the van der Marel et al. (2000) velocity\ndispersion profile do not reach the resolution of the Sand\net al. (2004) sample at small radii and therefore we can\nonly remark that the CNOC1 profiles appear to be consistent with their result.\nA comparison of the cluster number density profiles to\nthose measured at lower redshift shows that the K-band\nlight in the somewhat more massive, higher-redshift,\nCNOC1 clusters is more concentrated, at the 2\u03c3 level.\nL04 find cg = 2.88+0.21\n\u22120.10 for an ensemble of 93 z < 0.1\nclusters using K-band photometry from 2MASS. Similarly, R04 measure <cg > = 2.83 \u00b1 0.56 in the K-band\nfor the 9 CAIRNS clusters. Unfortunately, because these\nsamples and the CNOC1 clusters have different masses\nand are at different redshifts, understanding why their\nconcentrations differ is not entirely straightforward.\nN-body simulations show that c (for dark matter) is:\n1) higher in lower-mass halos; 2) higher in halos which\ncollapse first; and 3) for virialized halos becomes higher\nwith decreasing redshift as the halo accretes mass (e.g.,\nNavarro et al. 1997; Wechsler et al. 2002). However,\nthe simulations show that the dependence of c on 1) and\n3) is relatively weak, especially for cluster-mass halos.\nGiven that the concentration parameter is most strongly\ndependent on the collapse epoch of the halo, the factor\nof \u223c 1.5 difference between the concentrations of these\nsamples suggests an earlier collapse time for the CNOC1\nclusters. Furthermore, the fact that the CNOC1 clusters are more massive and observed at an earlier epoch\nthan the L04 and CAIRNS clusters would seem to support this interpretation. Nonetheless, these simulations\nare for dark matter only, and do not measure the concentration of stellar light. Therefore, it remains possible\nthat the difference in concentrations between the samples\ncould be caused by a redshift evolution in the concentration of stellar light, rather than different collapse epochs\nfor the two samples.\nInterestingly, the concentration of galaxy number density and dark matter are the same in the CNOC1 clusters\n(within the precision of our data), yet this is not seen in\nthe local clusters. Both L04 and R04 find that the Kband selected cg is smaller than cDM for their clusters.\nTheir results also agree with the simulations of Nagai\n& Kravtsov (2005) who find cDM > cg for a set of 8\nclusters in a full hydrodynamical simulation. Five of the\nsimulated clusters have cDM which is a factor of \u223c 2\nlarger than cg , while 2 clusters have cDM \u2248 cg . The 8th\ncluster has cg > cDM . These ratios are similar to the\n\n\f10\n\nNIR Properties of Moderate-Redshift Galaxy Clusters\n\nCAIRNS clusters, where the mean ratio between cDM\nand cg (for the NFW model) is 2.3 \u00b1 0.67. While the\nerrors in cg and cl for the CNOC1 clusters are somewhat\nlarge, they still exclude the possibility that the number\ndensity of K-band-selected galaxies is less concentrated\nthan the matter by a factor of 2 at the 3\u03c3 level (cg /cDM\n= 0.99 \u00b1 0.14 and cl /cDM = 1.01 \u00b1 0.17), suggesting\na real difference between the moderate and low-redshift\ncluster samples.\nIf we assume that the ratio of cDM /cg \u2248 2 at z = 0 seen\nby R04 and L04 is universal for galaxy clusters, then this\nsuggests the possibility of an evolution in the relative cg\nand cDM with redshift. For cDM to increase faster than\ncl or cg would require a preferential radial segregation of\ndark matter and light during the accretion process. One\nconsideration is that such a segregation could be mimicked by a redshift evolution in the radial distribution of\ncluster galaxy stellar populations. While possible, this\nis unlikely to be the case for our profiles which are computed using K-band light, which is fairly insensitive to\nstar-formation properties or dust. Furthermore, they are\ncomputed using a cut of K < K\u2217 + 1.0 where K\u2217 is very\nwell determined and consistent with simple passive evolution (\u00a76.3).\nThe simulations of Nagai & Kravtsov (2005) show that\naccreted galaxies near the cluster core have had \u223c 70%\nof their total halo mass stripped since being accreted by\nthe cluster, whereas those near the virial radius have lost\nonly \u223c 30%. Since stellar mass tends to be tightly bound\nwithin a dark matter halo, the process of tidal stripping\nof dark matter subhalos could plausibly cause a differential evolution in cDM and cg for galaxy clusters. The\ntidally stripped dark matter of the infalling galaxies may\nsink to the center of the cluster halo and increase cDM ,\nwhile the stellar mass will remain bound to the subhalo\nand continue to orbit within the cluster halo, where it\npreferentially spends more time at the perimeter.\nWhile this is a possibility, we note that with the current dataset it is impossible to untangle whether the difference in the relative concentrations of dark matter and\nstellar mass between the moderate and low-redshift samples is caused by such an evolution or simply because the\nratio of cDM to cg is not universal for all cluster masses\nat all epochs. It would be interesting to compare these\nresults with simulations that trace the redshift evolution of the cluster cDM and cg . It would also be useful\nto compare to simulations that have the same cDM as\nthe CNOC1 clusters. We note that all of the Nagai &\nKravstov (2005) clusters have higher concentrations than\nthe CNOC1 clusters and that the two clusters with the\nlowest concentrations (which are similar to the CNOC1\nclusters) have a ratio of cDM /cg \u2248 1.\n6. CLUSTER LUMINOSITY FUNCTIONS\n\nIn this section we compute the K-band LFs for cluster\ngalaxies. Our technique for creating stacked, k-corrected\nLFs using clusters at different redshifts and correcting\nfor imaging of varying depths is discussed in \u00a76.1. The\nmethod outlined there is used to create all LFs in the\nremainder of the paper (\u00a76 and \u00a77). In \u00a76.2 we construct\nan ensemble cluster LF using all 15 clusters centered at\nz \u223c 0.3. This allows us to fit the faint-end slope of cluster LF (\u03b1) as well as compare it to field LFs at the same\nredshift. In \u00a76.3 and \u00a76.4 we examine the redshift evo-\n\nFig. 8.- Top Panel: Surface number density per virial area of\nK-band selected galaxies vs. radius.

The solid line is the bestfit NFW profile excluding the BCGs. The dashed line is the best-fit\npower-law (\u03b3 = -1.38 \u00b1 0.03) including the BCGs.\n\nlution of K\u2217 as well as its dependence on cluster mass\nusing a fixed value of \u03b1.\n6.1. Technique for Constructing Luminosity Functions\n\nLFs are constructed by stacking the sample of 15 clusters into either a single cluster (\u00a76.2, \u00a77.2) or else into 3\nredshift (\u00a76.3, \u00a77.3) or mass (\u00a76.4, \u00a77.4) bins with 5 clusters per bin. Many clusters have enough spectroscopy\nto determine their individual LFs reasonably well; however, stacking the clusters improves the statistical errors.\nThe LFs are constructed by counting the number of cluster galaxies (multiplied by their spectroscopic magnitude\nweights) within R200 in bins of 0.25 mag. Most clusters\nhave some galaxies that lie outside the projected R200\nbut have velocities consistent with cluster membership;\nthese galaxies are excluded from the LFs. R04 showed\nthat the K-band cluster LF becomes fainter by \u223c 0.5\nmagnitudes from the virialized to infall regions in local\nclusters. There is insufficient coverage of the infall region\nto compute a separate LF and therefore the LFs are constructed using only galaxies within the virialized region.\nThe cluster BCGs are not removed when computing\nthe luminosity functions. The inclusion the BCGs results in inflated reduced-\u03c72 's for the fits (because the\nBCGs do not follow a Schechter function); however, similar to the optical cluster LFs of de Propris et al. (2003),\nwe find that removing the BCGs has no significant effect\non the fitted value of K\u2217 (\u223c 0.01 mag). Therefore, the\nBCGs are included as an indication of their abundance\nrelative to other cluster galaxies. In the determination\n\n\fMuzzin et al.\nof all LFs (\u00a76 and \u00a77) no attempt is made to account for\nthe incomplete coverage of R200 in some clusters. Most\nclusters have full coverage of R200 , and those that do not\nhave a strip of observations across the cluster which provides reasonably equal sampling of the cluster center and\nthe periphery.\nThe clusters are at different redshifts and therefore\nstacking them requires that the magnitudes of galaxies\nwithin each cluster be \"redshifted\" to a common redshift.\nFor the ensemble LFs (\u00a76.2, \u00a77.2) and the LFs for clusters of different masses (\u00a76.4, \u00a77.4) we use absolute magnitudes at a common redshift of z = 0.296, the median\nredshift of the sample. This requires the computation of\na distance modulus, k-correction and differential evolution correction for each galaxy. When we compute the\nredshift evolution of the LFs (\u00a76.3, \u00a77.3) we keep the conventions of the literature and use apparent magnitudes.\nThis requires only a differential distance modulus and\ndifferential k-correction.\n6.1.1. k-Corrections\n\nThe k-corrections are taken from the models of Poggianti (1997) who list corrections for E, E1 (an early-type\nwith longer duration episode of star-formation, which\nwe consider an S0), Sa, and Sc types. The K-band kcorrections are fairly independent of spectral type; however, there are small differences, and therefore determining a spectral type for each galaxy is preferable. The\navailability of the optical photometry allows us to compute g - r colors and estimate the spectral type of each\ngalaxy using a simple model for how the colors of different\nspectral types evolve with redshift. We have fit the g - r\nvs. r color-magnitude relation of each cluster (Paper III)\nusing the biweight estimator (Beers et al. 1990). For the\npurpose of spectral classification of the galaxies, we assume that all cluster galaxies that are < 0.1 magnitudes\nbluer than the cluster red-sequence are early-type galaxies. The redshift/color models of Fukugita, Shimasaku,\n& Ichikawa (1995) are then used as template colors for\nthe remaining galaxies. Rather than directly using the\ncolors in their models, the color of an early-type galaxy at\nthe appropriate redshift is determined empirically from\nthe cluster color-magnitude relation, and then the differential colors from the models are used to determine\nwhether galaxies are S0, Sa, or Sc types. This approach\nminimizes any systematics which might be caused by incorrect normalization of the models. Furthermore, because the colors between the 4 spectral types are significantly different, it implies an error of \u00b11 spectral type at\nmost. This is fairly inconsequential as the k-corrections\ndiffer by only 0.02 - 0.05 mag across all spectral-types for\ngalaxies at 0.2 < z < 0.55.\n6.1.2. Evolution Correction\n\nPrevious studies have shown that there is strong luminosity evolution with redshift in the K-band for both\nfield (Drory et al. 2003, Feulner et al. 2003, Pozzetti\net al. 2003) and cluster (dP99) galaxies. Therefore, a\ndifferential evolution correction must be included in the\nLFs to \"evolve\" higher and lower redshift clusters to the\nappropriate redshift. We use the evolution corrections\nlisted in Poggianti (1997). The Poggianti models consist of 15 Gyr old galaxies in a q0 = 0.225, H0 = 50\n\n11\n\nkm s\u22121 cosmology. We have adjusted the evolution corrections by assuming the galaxies are 13.7 Gyr old at\nthe present, and then mapped the q0 = 0.225 cosmology\non to our own by comparing lookback times. Once this\ncorrection is made, the Poggianti evolution corrections\nare in excellent agreement with our own measurement of\nthe luminosity evolution for cluster galaxies (see \u00a76.3).\nComputing the LF at the median redshift of the clusters,\nrather than correcting to z = 0 allows smaller evolution\ncorrections (which are of order 0.08 to 0.18 mag depending on spectral-type and cluster redshift) and therefore,\nthe choice of evolution model does not strongly affect the\nresults from the LFs.\n6.1.3. Completeness\n\nNot all clusters have photometry which is complete\nto the same absolute magnitude; hence, to maximize\nthe depth of the stacked LFs we adopt the approach of\nSchechter (1976). The clusters are ranked by limiting\nabsolute magnitude, and the limiting magnitude of the\nstacked LFs is set by the depth of the deepest cluster.\nClusters are then added to the stacked LF in the order of deepest to shallowest. The counts at magnitudes\nfainter than the completeness limit for a shallower cluster are extrapolated from the stacked LF of the deeper\nclusters. Using this technique means that the faintest\nbins in the stacked LF are scaled versions of the faintend of the deepest clusters, whereas the bright end is\ndetermined from all clusters. While not strictly correct,\nit maximizes the information on the bright-end of the\nLF, where the statistics are poorest. Furthermore, most\nof the clusters are complete to approximately the same\ndepth (\u223c K\u2217 + 2) with only the two highest redshift clusters (MS0016+16 and MS0451-03) being notably shallower (\u223c K\u2217 + 1); hence, only the faintest bins are affected by this approach. Because we do not use statistical background subtraction we assume the errors in each\nbin of the LF to simply be Poisson errors. The errors are\ncomputed before the faint-end of the LF is scaled.\nThe fitting of all LFs is done using the LevenbergMarquardt algorithm for \u03c72 minimization (Press et al.\n1992). Errors for the parameters are estimated from the\ncovariance matrix.\n6.2. Ensemble Luminosity Function and Comparison of\n\nthe Cluster and Field Luminosity Function at\nModerate Redshift\nHere we construct a composite LF from all 15 CNOC1\nclusters. By stacking the clusters we reduce the statistical errors and are able to make a good measurement of\nboth K\u2217 and \u03b1 using imaging of only moderate depth.\nFigure 9 shows the composite LF for all clusters centered at z = 0.296, the median redshift of the sample.\nThe best-fit Schechter function parameters are K\u2217 = 24.53 \u00b1 0.15 and \u03b1 = -0.84 \u00b1 0.08. The fit parameters\nfor this LF as well as all other LFs computed in this paper are listed in Table 3. If we compare this LF to the\nlocal K-band cluster LF measured by L04 we find the\nfollowing. 1) The faint-end of the LF has not evolved\nfrom z = 0, to z = 0.3. L04 find that the best-fit \u03b1 for\ntheir LF is \u03b1 = -0.84 \u00b1 0.02, which is identical to the\nbest-fit for the CNOC1 clusters. 2) The evolution in K\u2217\nis consistent with a passive luminosity evolution of the\nstellar population. L04 measure K\u2217 = -24.02 \u00b1 0.02 for\n\n\f12\n\nNIR Properties of Moderate-Redshift Galaxy Clusters\n\ntheir clusters, which implies K\u2217 for the CNOC1 clusters\nis 0.51 \u00b1 0.15 mag brighter at z = 0.3. The Poggianti\nevolution model (adapted to our cosmology, \u00a76.1) predicts 0.31 magnitudes of luminosity evolution from z =\n0 to z = 0.3 for an early-type galaxy, which is smaller, but\nconsistent with the observed evolution. A more detailed\ninvestigation and discussion of the redshift evolution of\nK\u2217 is presented in \u00a76.3.\nThe cluster LF shows no significant change (other than\nthe passive aging of the stellar populations) with redshift\nbetween z = 0 and z = 0.3; however, it is worthwhile\nto consider whether it depends on environment at z =\n0.3. In the local universe the K-band LFs of the field\nand cluster environments are different. B01, Lin et al.\n(2003), L04, R04, Ramella et al. (2004), and Kochanek\net al. (2003) have all shown that the field and cluster\nhave similar faint-end slopes, but that K\u2217 is brighter (by\n\u223c 0.2 - 0.4 mag) in clusters. Recently, several z > 0.1\nfield K-band LFs have become available in the literature,\nand we can now compare the cluster and field LFs at z =\n0.3.\nPozzetti et al. (2003) use the K20 survey with a set of\n\u223c 500 spectroscopic redshifts to determine the evolution\nof the K-band field LF from z = 0.2 to z = 1.5. They\nfind that the evolution of K\u2217 to z \u223c 1 is consistent with\na luminosity evolution of \u2206K\u2217 = -0.54 \u00b1 0.12. The MUNICS survey group combined their K-band photometry\nwith spectroscopic (Feulner et al. 2003) and photometric\n(Drory et al. 2003) redshifts to determine the evolution\nof the K-band field LF from z = 0 to z \u223c 1. Feulner et\nal. (2003) find that the K-band field galaxy LF evolves\nby \u2206K\u2217 = -0.70 \u00b1 0.30 magnitudes from z = 0 to z \u223c\n1, while Drory et al. (2003) find similar (\u2206K\u2217 \u223c -0.5 to\n-0.7 mag) results.\nThe faint-end slopes of the field LFs are steeper than\nthe \u03b1 = -0.84 \u00b1 0.08 measured for the CNOC1 clusters.\nIn their z = 0.2 - 0.65 redshift bin, Pozzetti et al. (2003)\nfind that \u03b1 = -1.25+0.25\n\u22120.20 , and Feulner et al. (2003) assume that \u03b1 = -1.1 in their z = 0.1 - 0.3 and z = 0.3 0.6 redshift bins. Unfortunately, the correlation between\nK\u2217 and \u03b1 makes the comparison of K\u2217 from LFs that use\ndifferent values of \u03b1 difficult to interpret. Therefore, we\nrefit the cluster LF forcing \u03b1 to be fixed at -1.1. This fit\nis shown as the dashed line in Figure 9. With \u03b1 fixed at\n-1.1, the best-fit value for the cluster LF is K\u2217 = -24.93\n\u00b1 0.04 (the smaller error bar arises because \u03b1 is held\nfixed).\nThe field LFs have coarse redshift bins, and therefore\nwe can only compare the cluster and field LFs as an average over a broad redshift range. For example, the lowest\nredshift bin in the Pozzetti et al. (2003) study is 0.2\n< z < 0.65, which spans the entire redshift range of the\nCNOC1 clusters. The mean redshift of the CNOC1 clusters is similar to the mean redshift of the two lowest bins\nfrom Feulner et al. (2003), so we average those values to\nK\u2217 = -24.68 \u00b1 0.26 at z \u223c 0.3. Comparing this to our\nvalue shows that K\u2217 is 0.25 \u00b1 0.26 magnitudes brighter\nin clusters than the field at z \u223c 0.3. If we compare our LF\nto the z = 0.2 - 0.6 redshift bin of Pozzetti et al. (2003)\n\u2217\nwho obtain K\u2217 = -24.87+0.54\n\u22120.77 we find that K in clusters\n+0.54\nis 0.05\u22120.77 magnitudes brighter than in the field. Both\nthese values agree within the large error bars; however,\nthe error bar on the Feulner et al. (2003) value is sig-\n\nFig. 9.- Stacked LF for all 15 clusters, corrected to a redshift\nof z = 0.296. The solid line is the best-fit Schechter function (K\u2217\n= -24.53 \u00b1 0.15, \u03b1 = -0.84 \u00b1 0.08). The dashed line is the best-fit\nSchechter function with a fixed \u03b1 = -1.1 (K\u2217 = -24.93 \u00b1 0.04). The\nbright end of the LF diverges from a Schechter function because\nthe BCGs are included.\n\nnificantly smaller, and consistent with the results from\nthe much larger photometric redshift study of Drory et\nal. (2003). Therefore, we adopt \u2206K\u2217 = -0.25 \u00b1 0.26\nbetween field and cluster at z \u223c 0.3 as our best result.\nUnfortunately, the errors bars on the field values of K\u2217\nare quite large, and clearly any difference between the\ncluster and field at moderate redshift is of the order of\nthe error bars or less. Despite the large error bars, it\nis interesting to note that the difference in K\u2217 between\ncluster and field galaxies at z = 0.3 is similar to that at\nz \u223c 0. This suggests that the processes which cause the\nK-band luminosity function, and by corollary the stellar\nmass function, to be brighter in clusters (e.g., hierarchical growth of cluster galaxies from mergers) probably\nhave already occurred by z \u223c 0.3, and that there is little\ndifferential evolution since then. A larger field K-band\nstudy, with finer redshift bins and better constraints on\nK\u2217 would be useful for investigating this further.\n6.3. Redshift Evolution of the Cluster Luminosity\n\nFunction\nIn \u00a76.2 we showed that the composite LF for all 15\nCNOC1 clusters, when compared with z \u223c 0 clusters, is\nconsistent with no evolution in the faint-end slope and\npassive evolution of the stellar populations. Here we\nmake a more detailed examination of the redshift evolution of K\u2217 by separating the clusters into 3 redshift\nbins with 5 clusters per bin. The LFs are computed at\nthe mean redshift of the 5 clusters within each bin. This\ncorresponds to redshift bins of z = 0.21, 0.29, and 0.46.\nFor these LFs we use apparent rather than absolute magnitudes so that we can make a direct comparison to the\nLFs of dP99.\nWhen the LFs are separated into redshift bins, they do\nnot have enough depth to obtain meaningful constraints\non both K\u2217 and \u03b1 (especially in the highest redshift bin).\nTherefore, we hold \u03b1 constant and fit only K\u2217 and \u03c6\u2217 .\nRather than assume \u03b1 = -0.84, the best-fit value for the\nensemble LF, we adopt the value of \u03b1 = -0.9 assumed\nby dP99, which is consistent with our best-fit. Because\nof the strong correlation between K\u2217 and \u03b1, assuming\nthe same faint-end slope also allows for a straightforward\ncomparison of K\u2217 's from different studies. We note that\n\n\fMuzzin et al.\ngiven that there is a \u223c 10% uncertainty in \u03b1 from the\ncombined LF (\u00a76.2), the error on K\u2217 for a given \u03b1 is an\nunderestimate of the total error budget. To obtain an estimate of the total error budget for K\u2217 which includes the\nuncertainty in \u03b1, we refit the LFs with values of \u03b1 that\nrange from -0.76 to -0.92 (i.e., enclosing the 1\u03c3 error bar\nin \u03b1 from \u00a76.2). This refitting results in values of K\u2217 that\nare +0.15 magnitudes fainter when \u03b1 = 0.76 and -0.05\nmagnitudes brighter when \u03b1 = 0.92. These additional\ndeviations are comparable to the fitting errors with fixed\n\u03b1s (see Table 3).\nIn Figure 10 we plot the LFs and the Schechter function fits for the 3 redshift bins. The redshift evolution of\nK\u2217 for the CNOC1 clusters is compared with the dP99\nvalues in Figure 11. The lines in the figure are models\nof single-burst populations with a zf = 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.8,\nand 5.0 constructed using the Bruzual & Charlot (2003)\ncode. The model is a 0.1 Gyr duration single-burst with\nsolar metallicity followed by an exponentially declining\nstar-formation rate with \u03c4 = 0.1 Gyr. The model is normalized to K\u2217 = -24.02 at z = 0, the L04 value which\nwas measured using a faint-end slope (\u03b1 = -0.84) that\nis similar to the \u03b1 = -0.9 assumed for our clusters and\nthe dP99 clusters. Figure 11 demonstrates that the stellar populations in CNOC1 clusters are consistent with a\npassively evolving population formed at z > 1.5; however,\nthe values of K\u2217 for the CNOC1 clusters are significantly\nfainter than those of the dP99 clusters. If we compare\nthe z = 0.21, 0.29, and 0.46 bins of the CNOC1 clusters\nto the z = 0.20, 0.32, and 0.46 bins of dP99, K\u2217 for the\nCNOC1 clusters is fainter by 0.36, 0.19, and 0.76 mag,\nrespectively, and are 0.44 mag fainter on average.\nWe have considered several possible explanations for\nthe very different values of K\u2217 between the studies, the\nmost likely of which is the systematic differences in the\nphotometry. In \u00a73.4 we noted that for the 3 clusters that\noverlap our sample and the SED02 sample (the data used\nto compute the dP99 LFs), our photometry is systematically fainter by 0.21 mag. If the entire datasets differ by\nthis much, then this accounts for approximately half of\nthe discrepancy in K\u2217 .\nIt is possible that the different radial coverage in the\ntwo samples is partially responsible for the difference in\nK\u2217 . R04 showed that the K-band cluster LF becomes\nfainter from the virial to infall region. If a such radial\ndependence also exists within the virial region, then this\nmay partially explain the discrepancy because the dP99\ndata cover only the central region of the clusters (\u223c 0.5\n- 1 Mpc) whereas our observations cover out to R200 (\u223c\n1 - 2 Mpc) for most clusters. We test this possibility by\nrecomputing the LFs using only galaxies within 0.5 Mpc\nof the cluster center. K\u2217 from those luminosity functions\nis brighter; however, by only \u223c 0.1 magnitudes, which\nis smaller than the discrepancy, even if photometry accounts for a portion of it. We also consider the possibility\nthat the size of the magnitude bins used for the LFs may\ninfluence the value of K\u2217 . dP99 use larger bins (0.5 mag)\nwhich might bias the value of K\u2217 to brighter values because of the poor statistics at the bright-end of the LF.\nWhen we recompute our LFs using 0.5 mag bins instead\nof 0.25 mag bins we find that this has no effect on K\u2217 .\nPerhaps the most significant difference in the methods used to derive the luminosity functions is that we\nuse spectroscopic redshifts, whereas dP99 use statisti-\n\n13\n\ncal background subtraction. In principle, both methods\nwork equally well, however, the statistical method requires the stacking of a large number of clusters, because\ncosmic variance in the background can cause large errors in the LFs. Two of the three dP99 redshift bins\nthat compare with ours have only a few clusters in each\nbin (3, 9, and 2 respectively). A higher than average\nbackground in the cluster field might result in an overestimate of the number of cluster galaxies. We cannot\nbe conclusive as to why the value of K\u2217 in the CNOC1\nclusters is significantly fainter than in the dP99 sample;\nhowever, our simple comparisons suggest that the size\nof the magnitude bins and the different radial coverage\nbetween the samples has little effect on K\u2217 . Most likely,\nthe difference is caused by differences in the photometry\n(\u00a73.4), and possibly because of the different techniques\nused for background subtraction.\nComparing the LFs to the K\u2217 = -24.02, \u03b1 = -0.84\nLF of L04 shows there is an evolution of \u2206K\u2217 = -0.35\n\u00b1 0.06 mag from z = 0 to z = 0.46. This agrees well\nwith the passive evolution predicted from the Bruzual &\nCharlot single burst, zf = 2.8 model (\u2206K\u2217 = -0.40) and\nthe passive evolution from the Poggianti (1997) model\n(\u2206K\u2217 = -0.39). We conclude that the CNOC1 clusters\nagree well with the scenario where the bulk of the stars in\ngalaxies are formed at high-redshift and evolve passively\nthereafter. Furthermore, the close relation between the\nK-band light and stellar mass of a galaxy suggest that\nthe stellar mass function of K < K\u2217 + 2 cluster galaxies\nis unchanged up to z = 0.3.\nIt is difficult to understand how no evolution in \u03b1 (\u00a76.2)\nand purely passive evolution of K\u2217 is compatible with\nthe L04 HOD data which suggest a significant number\nof mergers in this redshift range. Even if mergers populate all parts of the LF appropriately as to maintain the\noverall shape, K\u2217 would have to be fainter than passive\nevolution at higher-redshift to account for the breakup of\ngalaxies into their progenitors. It is possible that the reduction in luminosity of galaxies at high redshift due to\nbreakup could be offset by increased amounts of starformation which correspondingly brighten the galaxy,\nand therefore mimic passive evolution; however, such a\nscenario seems contrived, and the most reasonable interpretation of the data is that galaxies in massive, relaxed,\nX-ray-selected clusters do not experience a significant\nnumber of mergers between 0 < z < 0.3. This may not\nbe a surprising result, as the high velocity dispersion of\ngalaxies in the cluster environment makes merging difficult. The passive evolution of the LFs at moderate\nredshift does not rule out the possibility that mergers\nplay a role in cluster galaxy evolution; however, it suggests that if they are important, they most likely occur\nin higher-redshift systems that are in the process of relaxing (e.g., MS1054+03, Tran et al. 2005), rather than\nmassive virialized clusters at z \u223c 0.3.\n6.4. Luminosity Functions of Different Mass Clusters\n\nHere we separate the CNOC1 sample into 3 mass bins\nusing cluster dynamical masses determined from the velocity dispersions of Carlberg et al. (1997a, see Paper\nII for values of M200 computed using a \u039bCDM cosmology) and investigate the dependence of the K-band LF\non cluster mass. The mean masses of the three bins are\n<M200 > = 2.73 \u00d7 1014 M\u2299 , 5.96 \u00d7 1014 M\u2299 , and 1.34\n\n\f14\n\nNIR Properties of Moderate-Redshift Galaxy Clusters\n\nFig. 10.- Stacked LF for clusters in three different redshift\nbins. Each LF is composed from a stack of 5 clusters that have been\ncorrected to the mean redshift listed in each panel. The solid-line is\nthe best-fit Schechter function assuming \u03b1 = -0.9. The bright-end\nof the LFs sometimes diverge from a Schecheter function because\nthe BCGs are included.\n\nFig. 12.- Stacked LF for clusters in three different mass bins.\nEach LF is composed from a stack of 5 clusters. The solid-line is\nthe best-fit Schechter function assuming \u03b1 = -0.9. The bright-end\nof the LFs sometimes diverge from a Schechter function because the\nBCGs are included. There appears to be no correlation between K\u2217\nand mass for over the mass range covered by the CNOC1 clusters.\n\nCNOC1 clusters, and similarly, they do not show a dependence of K\u2217 on cluster mass. Although masses for\ntheir clusters were unavailable at the time, dP99 divided\ntheir sample into high and low optical richness and high\nand low X-ray luminosity (Lx ) subgroups. Both optical\nrichness and Lx are correlated with cluster mass (Yee &\nEllingson 2003; although there is some scatter) and therefore these subgroups can be considered roughly as high\nand low-mass subgroups. Similar to our result, dP99 find\nthat within the errors, K\u2217 is the same between high and\nlow richness and high and low Lx clusters from z = 0.15\nto z \u223c 1.0.\nGiven the uncertainty of our measurement of the difference in K\u2217 between different mass bins, our result is\nconsistent at < 1 \u03c3 with both no dependence of K\u2217 on\ncluster mass (dP99) or a very weak (\u223c 0.1 mag) dependence of K\u2217 on cluster mass (L04).\nFig. 11.- Evolution of K\u2217 as a function of redshift. Solid points\nare the CNOC1 cluster LFs (Figure 10) and the open diamonds\nare clusters from dP99. The long-dashed, triple-dot-dashed, dotdashed, solid, and dashed lines are single burst models with zf\n= 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.8, 5.0 respectively. The models have been normalized to the low-redshift value of K\u2217 from the L04 study (see\ntext). The bright galaxies in the CNOC1 clusters are consistent\nwith a scenario where the bulk of the stellar mass is formed at high\nredshift and evolves passively thereafter.\n\n\u00d7 1015 M\u2299 , and we designate these low, mid, and highmass bins, respectively.\nFigure 12 shows the LFs for the 3 mass bins, as well as\nthe best Schechter function fits, again using a fixed \u03b1 =\n-0.9. The values of K\u2217 for the three mass bins are K\u2217 =\n-24.51 \u00b1 0.08, -24.59 \u00b1 0.06, -24.52 \u00b1 0.05 for the low,\nmid and high mass bins respectively. This shows that\nthere is no significant dependence of K\u2217 on cluster mass\nover the one order-of-magnitude range in mass covered\nby the CNOC1 clusters.\nInterestingly, L04 do not find the same result in local\nclusters. They divide their sample of 93 clusters into high\nand low-mass subgroups (using masses determined from\nX-ray temperatures) and find that \u03b1 is similar between\nthe two groups (\u03b1 = -0.84 \u00b1 0.03 and -0.81 \u00b1 0.04 for\nhigh-mass and low-mass clusters, respectively); however,\nK\u2217 is brighter by 0.16 \u00b1 0.07 mag in high-mass clusters\n(K\u2217 = -24.10\u00b1 0.04 in high-mass clusters vs. K\u2217 = -23.94\n\u00b1 0.06 in low-mass clusters). The L04 high-mass clusters have a mean M200 similar to the mid-mass CNOC1\nclusters, while their low-mass clusters have a mean M200\nsimilar to the low-mass CNOC1 clusters, and therefore\nthe corresponding difference between those mass bins in\nthe CNOC1 sample is \u2206K\u2217 = -0.08 \u00b1 0.10 mag.\nThe dP99 clusters have a similar redshift range as the\n\n7. LUMINOSITY FUNCTIONS OF DIFFERENT\nSPECTRAL-TYPES\n\nThe analysis in \u00a76 demonstrated that the K-band cluster LF shows no evolution in \u03b1 and only passive evolution\nin K\u2217 from z = 0 to z = 0.3. Because of the close correlation between K-band light and stellar mass it also\nsuggests no strong evolution in the stellar mass function\nof cluster galaxies over this redshift range. However,\nstudies of the evolution of morphology-density relation\n(Postman et al. 2005, Smith et al., 2005, Dressler et\nal., 1997), as well as the star-formation rate in clusters\n(e.g., Balogh et al. 1999, Poggianti et al. 1999), and the\nButcher-Oemler effect (Ellingson et al. 2001) suggest\nthat there is significant evolution in the morphological\nand star-formation properties of the cluster galaxy population over the same redshift range. Therefore, it seems\nlikely that that the LFs of the early and late-type populations will evolve differently over this redshift range,\neven though the combined LF of cluster galaxies shows\nonly passive evolution.\nThis possibility can be addressed directly within the\nCNOC1 sample using the spectroscopy. Ellingson et\nal. (2001) performed Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA) on the spectroscopic data and classified galaxies\ninto three broad spectral-types. In this section we use\nthe PCA analysis and examine the K-band LF of these\nspectral-types. In \u00a77.1 we briefly summarize the PCA\ndecomposition. In \u00a77.2 we construct a composite LF for\nthe spectral types using all 15 clusters so that we can fit\n\u03b1. Using the best-fit values of \u03b1 we study the redshift\nevolution of K\u2217 and its dependence on cluster mass for\nthe different spectral types in \u00a77.3 and \u00a77.4.\n\n\fMuzzin et al.\n7.1. PCA Decomposition\nHere we present a brief discussion of the PCA analysis. A thorough explanation of the fitting method and\nreliability of the spectral-typing is presented in Ellingson\net al. (2001). The principal components of a galaxy's\nspectrum are determined by decomposing it using three\ngalaxy types as eigenvectors: Elliptical, Emission-line,\nand Balmer-line. The template spectra used for these\ntypes are composite spectra drawn from the Las Campanas Redshift survey (Shectman et al. 1996). In the\nPCA analysis, each eigenvector is assigned an amplitude\nfrom 0 to 1, based on how well it represents the spectrum\nbeing fit. The total amplitude of all three eigenvectors\nadds up to 1. While this analysis is simplistic, it is quite\neffective at providing a reasonable quantitative measurement of the principal component of a galaxy's spectrum. Using the amplitudes of the PCA decomposition\nwe divide the galaxies into 2 broad spectral-types: Early\n(ELL), and Emission + Balmer (EM+BAL). Galaxies\nwith ELL > 0.5 are considered ELL, and those with ELL\n< 0.5 are considered part of the EM+BAL class. This\nprovides a simple way to identify star-forming or recently\nstar-forming galaxies from those which are dominated by\nabsorption-lines and are likely to have been quiescent for\nat least a few Gyr. It is important to note that this\nanalysis is a spectral analysis, not a morphological one.\nGalaxies which have early-type morphologies may still\nbe considered EM+BAL galaxies if they show the appropriate spectral features (in fact, the BCGs in the highest redshift clusters all show emission lines and therefore\ndo not fall into the ELL category). Separating galaxies\nby spectral-type (rather than morphology) is similar to\nthe analysis done by B01 for low-redshift clusters and\ngroups (although they use line indices, not PCA), and\ntherefore allows easy comparison between moderate and\nlow-redshift clusters.\n7.2. Ensemble Spectrally-Types Luminosity Functions\n\nIn Figure 13 we show the LFs for ELL and EL+BAL\nclasses. Immediately obvious is the difference between\nthe faint-end slopes of the two LFs. The best-fit faintend slope for the EM+BAL galaxies is \u03b1 = -0.95 \u00b1 0.27,\nwhile for the ELL galaxies it is \u03b1 = 0.17 \u00b1 0.18. This\ndifference indicates significant redshift evolution in the\nfaint populations of these spectral-types because in the\nlocal field and local clusters their faint-end slopes are\nnearly identical.\nIn the local field, Kochanek et al. (2001) showed that\nfor morphologically-typed galaxies, early and late-types\nhave faint-end slopes of -0.92 \u00b1 0.10 and -0.87 \u00b1 0.09\nrespectively. Bell et al. (2003) performed the same analysis using spectral-types from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopy and 2MASS photometry and\nfound that \u03b1 was similar across the types, but that it\nwas slightly shallower for the early-types. In local clusters B01 examined a set of galaxies in the field, group,\nand cluster environment using 2MASS photometry and\nspectroscopic redshifts from the Las Campanas Redshift\nSurvey. They split their sample into emission-line (EL)\nand no-emission-line (NEL) types and although the error\nbars are large, they find that local cluster EL and NEL\ngalaxies have comparable faint-end slopes (\u03b1 = -1.18 \u00b1\n0.76 for EL and \u03b1 = -1.28 \u00b1 0.50 for NEL). They also\n\n15\n\nfind that these values of \u03b1 are similar to their local field\nand group values for EL and NEL galaxies.\nOur result suggests a strong decrease in the faint ELL\npopulation in clusters from z = 0 to z = 0.3, whereas the\nfaint EM+BAL population remains mostly unchanged.\nWe can make a rough estimate of the relative decrease\nof K\u2217 < K < K\u2217 + 2 ELL galaxies between z = 0 and\nz = 0.3 by integrating the LFs. Assuming the B01, z = 0\nvalue of \u03b1 in local clusters (\u03b1 = -1.18 \u00b1 0.76) and our\nown best-fit value for z = 0.3 clusters (\u03b1 = 0.17 \u00b1 0.18)\nand integrating the number of galaxies between K\u2217 < K\n< K\u2217 + 2 for these different values of \u03b1, we find that the\nnumber of ELL galaxies with K\u2217 < K < K\u2217 + 2 decreases\nby a factor of 3.8 over this redshift range. Considering\nthe large error bar in the B01 value of \u03b1, we also compare\nto an \u03b1 = -0.92 LF (the Kochanek et al. 2001 value for\nfield early-types). If the local cluster early-type population has the same faint-end slope as the field, then the\nrelative decrease in K\u2217 < K < K\u2217 + 2 galaxies is a factor\nof 2.6.\nOne potential concern with our ELL LF is that it\nmay suffer from selection effects caused by difficulty obtaining successful redshifts for faint, absorption-line systems. Extensive tests on the completeness of the spectroscopy (Yee et al. 1996) and PCA analysis (Ellingson\net al. 2001) show that the spectroscopy is complete to\nthe adopted limits; however, given the implications it is\nworth exploring this result further. As a check that the\nmeasured decrease in \u03b1 is not caused by selection effects\nin the faintest bins, we refit the ELL LF using galaxies\nmore than a full magnitude brighter than the spectroscopic completeness limit. This LF has a slightly steeper\nslope and a larger error bar (\u03b1 = -0.04 \u00b1 0.24); however,\nit is > 3\u03c3 different than the EM+BAL limit. Furthermore, within the error, it is completely consistent with\nthe measurement using the full spectroscopic catalogue.\nFrom this we conclude that a significant difference in the\nnumber of faint ELL vs. EM+BAL galaxies does exist,\nand is not a selection effect.\nA decreasing number of faint, non-starforming galaxies\nwith increasing redshift is expected in the \"downsizing\"\nscenario of galaxy formation (Cowie el al. 1996). Moreover, the same decrease is predicted by studies of the\nfundamental plane in the local universe. Nelan et al.\n(2005) show that the typical age of the stellar populations of low-luminosity early-types is \u223c 4 Gyr. If these\ngalaxies form in the monolithic collapse scenario, then\nthis suggests that they would be star-forming galaxies at\nz > 0.3 and would not populate the faint-end of the ELL\nLF.\nThe same trend has also been observed as a decrease\nin the number of faint red-sequence galaxies at high redshift. Kodama et al. (2004), De Lucia et al. (2004), and\nTanaka et al. (2005) all show that clusters at z > 0.7\nhave fewer faint red-sequence galaxies than their lowredshift counterparts.\nInterestingly, the decrease in faint ELL galaxies in the\nCNOC1 clusters is not met with a corresponding increase\nin the number of EM+BAL galaxies. The faint-end slope\nmeasured from these galaxies is in good agreement with\nthe local field and cluster values. This suggests that if\nthe faint-end of the ELL LF is built-up between z = 0.3\nand z = 0 from the quenching of star-formation in faint\nEM+BAL galaxies, that these galaxies must be replen-\n\n\f16\n\nNIR Properties of Moderate-Redshift Galaxy Clusters\n\nFig. 13.- Left Panel: Ensemble LF for galaxies in all 15 clusters with spectra classified as ELL. The LF is corrected to z =\n0.296. Right Panel: Same as the left panel for galaxies classified\nas EM+BAL. The bright-end of the LFs diverge from a Schechter\nfunction because the BCGs are included.\n\nished in order to maintain the faint-end slope. This could\nnaturally be explained by a scenario where faint, starforming galaxies are continuously accreted from the field\nand gradually transformed into quiescent galaxies.\n7.3. Redshift Evolution of Spectrally-Typed Luminosity\n\nFunctions\nIt is also useful to test whether the value of K\u2217 from\nthe spectrally-typed LFs shows any differential evolution\nwith redshift. Here we compute LFs for the spectraltypes at different redshifts in the identical manner as\n\u00a76.3. For these LFs we hold the faint-end fixed using\nthe values measured in \u00a77.2 (\u03b1 = 0.2 for ELL galaxies\nand \u03b1 = -0.9 for EM+BAL galaxies). Figure 14 shows\nthe resulting LFs, and the Schechter function fits. Surprisingly, the ELL LFs have fainter values of K\u2217 than\nthe EM+BAL galaxies. The same result is not seen in\nlocal K-band cluster and field studies. B01 show that\nin local clusters the NEL galaxies are 0.60 mag brighter\nthan the EL galaxies and Kochanek et al. (2001) show\nthat they are 0.55 mag brighter in the local field. While\nK\u2217 is brighter for the EM+BAL galaxies in the CNOC1\nclusters, this does not mean that the average EM+BAL\ngalaxy is brighter than the average ELL because K\u2217 and\n\u03b1 are correlated. Shallower values of \u03b1 typically result\nin fainter values of K\u2217 . As an example, if we refit the\nELL galaxies using a much steeper faint-end slope \u03b1 =\n-0.5 (the value measured for the stellar mass function\nof early-type galaxies in the local universe by Bell et al.\n2003), then we find that K\u2217 is brighter for the ELL galaxies by 0.51, 0.50, and 0.59 mag for the z = 0.21, 0.29, and\n0.46 bins, and that, similar to the local K-band studies,\nthe ELL galaxies have values of K\u2217 which are brighter\nthan the EM+BAL galaxies.\nWe can compare the evolution of K\u2217 with some simple\nmodels of galaxy evolution. The left and right panels\nof Figure 15 shows a plot of K\u2217 vs. z for the ELL and\nEM+BAL types, respectively. The solid-line in the right\npanel is a zf = 2.8 single-burst model normalized to the\nB01 value of K\u2217 = -23.31 for EL galaxies at z = 0. The\ndashed line in the right panel is a stellar population constructed with the Bruzual & Charlot (2003) code which\nforms half its stars in a single-burst at z = 2.8, and the\nother half with a constant star-formation rate of 5M\u2299\nyr\u22121 . The solid line in the left panel shows the zf = 2.8\nsingle-burst model for the ELL galaxies. Unfortunately,\nthe ELL passive evolution model can not be normalized\nto the K\u2217 computed for the NEL LF by B01 because it is\nmeasured using \u03b1 = -1.28 and this value is very different\nfrom the \u03b1 = 0.2 that we use. Instead, the ELL singleburst model is normalized to pass through the z = 0.29\nvalue of K\u2217 for ELL galaxies.\n\nFig. 14.- Top Row: LFs at increasing redshift for galaxies\nclassified as ELL. Bottom Row: Luminosity functions at increasing\nredshift for galaxies classified as EM+BAL. Each LF is constructed\nfrom a stack of 5 clusters.\n\nFig. 15.- Left Panel: Redshift evolution in K\u2217 for ELL galaxies.\nThe solid line is passive evolution model normalized to pass through\nthe z = 0.29 point. Right Panel: Redshift evolution in K\u2217 for\nEM+BAL galaxies. The solid-line is a passive evolution model\nnormalized to the B01 EL K\u2217 . The dot-dashed line is a single-burst\n+ constant star-formation rate model with the same normalization.\n\nWhile it is difficult to make robust conclusions from\nFigure 15, it is worth noting that both the ELL and\nEM+BAL types are consistent with single-burst, passive\nevolution models. This result, combined with the fact\nthat the total cluster K\u2217 evolves passively would be consistent with a scenario where the bulk of the stellar mass\nin bright cluster galaxies is formed at high-redshift and\nthe dominant evolution thereafter is the passive aging of\nthe stellar populations, regardless of spectral-type. It also\nsuggests there is no inconsistency between studies which\nfind a significant change in the morphology, color and\nstar-formation properties of the cluster galaxy population at z > 0.1, and studies which have shown that the\nevolution of the their stellar population is primarily passive (e.g., Stanford et al. 1998, van Dokkum et al. 1998).\nEven though the LFs of the ELL and EM+BAL galaxies\nat z = 0.3 change significantly by z = 0, there is no corresponding change the total cluster LF. This suggests that\nthe transformations in morphology and color/spectraltype which occur to cluster galaxies over the same redshift range are \"superficial\" - they have little effect on\nthe overall stellar mass of the galaxies which transform.\n7.4. Dependence of Spectrally-Typed Luminosity\n\nFunctions on Cluster Mass\nIn \u00a76.4 we showed that there was no dependence of the\noverall K-band LF on cluster mass for the mass range\ncovered by the CNOC1 clusters. Here we test whether\nthe LFs of galaxies of different spectral-types varies in\n\n\fMuzzin et al.\n\nFig. 16.- Top Row: LFs for galaxies classified as ELL in clusters\nof different mass. Bottom Row: Luminosity functions for galaxies\nclassified as EM+BAL in the same clusters. Each LF is constructed\nfrom a stack of 5 clusters, and corrected to a mean redshift of z =\n0.296\n\nclusters of different mass.\nFigure 16 shows the LFs for the ELL and EM+BAL\ntypes in the 3 mass bins used in \u00a76.4. The LFs are computed by again assuming \u03b1 = 0.2 for ELL galaxies and\n\u03b1 = -0.9 for EM+BAL galaxies. Figure 16 demonstrates\nthat there is no significant change in K\u2217 for both spectral types across all three mass bins, with the possible\nexception of a slight trend (at \u223c 2\u03c3 level) with mass for\nthe ELL galaxies. This suggests that any properties of\nthe cluster environment that depend on the cluster mass\n(e.g., ram-pressure stripping efficiency, tidal forces) do\nnot drastically alter the LF of different spectral types.\nIt might be expected that there would be fewer faint,\nEM+BAL galaxies than bright EM+BAL galaxies in\nhigher-mass clusters, as they would be more susceptible\nto having their star-formation truncated by tidal forces\nor ram-pressure stripping. However, to the depth of our\nLFs, we see no such reduction in the number of these\ngalaxies.\nAlso, given that K\u2217 becomes brighter through the field,\ngroup, and cluster environment in the local universe\n(Kochanek et al. 2001, B01, Ramella et al. 2004, L04,\nR04) it is surprising that there is no significant difference\nfor the spectral-types across the cluster mass spectrum.\n\n17\n\nby an earlier collapse epoch for the higher-mass, higherredshift CNOC1 clusters. Furthermore, the ratio of cDM\nto cg for the CNOC1 clusters is less than in local clusters and we suggest that this is the product of either a\nnon-universal ratio of cDM to cg for clusters, or else a\nrelative evolution in cDM and cg with redshift.\nAnalysis of the cluster LFs show that the evolution of\nK\u2217 between 0.2 < z < 0.5 is consistent with a scenario\nwhere the majority of the stellar mass in cluster galaxies\nforms at high redshift (zf > 1.5) and evolves passively\nthereafter. The faint-end slope of the LF shows no evolution from the value measured in local clusters. These\nresults imply that the stellar mass buildup of individual\ngalaxies through major mergers is negligible in massive,\nX-ray selected clusters from z = 0.3 to z = 0.\nWe have also compared the K-band luminosity functions at moderate redshift in different environments ranging from the field to high-mass clusters. Our results suggest that K\u2217 may increase slightly in brightness from\nthe field to the cluster environment at moderate-redshift;\nhowever, the error bars on the field K-band LFs are large\nand therefore, the data could also be consistent with no\nchange. Unlike local clusters, it appears that for the\nCNOC1 clusters there is no correlation between K\u2217 and\nthe dynamical mass of the cluster.\nBy dividing galaxies into star-forming/recently starforming (EM+BAL) and non-starforming (ELL) types\nwe examined the individual LFs of these types. The\nfaint-end slope of the ELL LF is significantly shallower\nthan the faint-end slope for EM+BAL LF. Comparing\nthe value of \u03b1 for ELL galaxies to local field and cluster LFs suggest that the number of passive K\u2217 < K <\nK\u2217 + 2 galaxies in clusters decreases by a factor of \u223c 3\nfrom z = 0 to z = 0.3. These results are consistent with\n\"downsizing\" in the cluster galaxy population.\nThe spectrally-typed LFs also show that K\u2217 for both\nELL and EM+BAL galaxies is consistent with a passive\nevolution scenario and this, in tandem with the passive\nevolution of the combined cluster LF, suggests that the\nbulk of the stellar mass in both types of galaxies is formed\nat high-redshift, and that subsequent star-formation or\nchanges in morphology do not affect the overall stellar\nmass of the galaxies. The spectrally-typed LFs also show\nthat K\u2217 for both EM+BAL and ELL classes is independent of the mass of the cluster that they reside in.\n\n8. SUMMARY\n\nWe have presented K-band photometry for 15\nmoderate-redshift CNOC1 clusters with extensive optical spectroscopy. Our results show that both the luminosity and number density profiles of the clusters are\nwell-fit by NFW profiles with concentration parameters\nof c \u223c 4. Furthermore, comparison with the dynamical\nmass analysis for the same clusters shows that for massive, moderate-redshift, X-ray selected clusters, K-band\nlight closely traces the dark matter mass at R < 1.5R200 ,\nexcept possibly in the cluster core. The galaxy number\nand luminosity densities of the CNOC1 clusters are more\nconcentrated than local clusters, and this is likely caused\n\nA.M. would like to cite useful conversations and help\nfrom David Gilbank and Kris Blindert which significantly improved the quality of the data analysis.
