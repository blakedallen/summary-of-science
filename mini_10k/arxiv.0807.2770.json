It clearly displays a Dirac cone with the Dirac point shifted only slightly above the Fermi\nlevel. The moir\u00e9 resulting from the overlaid graphene and Ir(111) surface lattices imposes a superperiodic\npotential giving rise to Dirac cone replicas and the opening of minigaps in the band structure.\nPACS numbers: 73.22.-f, 73.21.Cd, 79.60.-i, 81.05.Uw\n\nGraphene has recently become a material of increasing scientific interest [1, 2]. Its honeycomb structure composed\nof two equivalent triangular carbon sublattices has important\nconsequences for the dynamics of the charge carriers. The\n\u03c0 and \u03c0 \u2217 bands of free-standing graphene are conical in the\nproximity of the Fermi energy, with the vertices touching exactly at the Fermi level. This allows a mapping of their behavior to a model of massless fermions obeying the Dirac equation, leading to a plethora of new, observed or predicted phenomena, such as anomalous half-integer quantum Hall effect\nor the Klein paradox (see e.g. ref. [1]). The Dirac character and the large mobility of charge carriers in graphene [3],\nalong with the ability to manipulate conduction through field\neffect [4] or doping [5] makes graphene potentially a material\nfor future electronics.\n\nat the crossing points of\u221aa band\u221aand a backfolded band, as\nfound, e.g., for Si(111)- 21 \u00d7 21-(Ag + Au) [24]. However, minigaps were neither observed in graphene on SiC [8]\nnor on Ru(0001), where they are expected to be present [18].\nHere we report on the investigation of the electronic structure of graphene on Ir(111) by angle-resolved photoelectron\nspectroscopy (ARPES). We show that graphene exhibits a\nDirac cone comparable to that of pristine graphene. Due to the\nmoir\u00e9 superstructure resulting from the lattice mismatch between graphene and Ir(111) a corresponding superperiodic potential exists which gives rise to the opening of moir\u00e9-induced\nminigaps in the band structure.\n\nMost of the experimental work on the electronic structure\nof supported graphene has been performed with graphene on\nSiC [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Early research related to graphene on\ntransition metal surfaces [11, 12, 13, 14] has received renewed\ninterest in the last years as epitaxial graphene layers of high\nstructural quality can be grown [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21].\nMoreover, the electronic interaction of graphene with a metal\nis not only of fundamental interest. Recent calculations appear to imply that graphene which interacts weakly with a\nmetal will result in a favorable contact with high transmission\n[22]. The charge carrier properties of graphene on a metal\nhave been studied on only two substrates, Ni(111) [15, 16]\nand Ru(0001) [17, 18, 19]. The \u03c0-bands of graphene strongly\nhybridize with Ni(111) [16], while the small bonding distance of the first layer of graphene and the absence of vibrational/electronic signatures characteristic of graphene indicate\nthe same on Ru(0001) [18, 19].\n\nThe experiments have been performed in two ultra-high\nvacuum systems for ARPES in Zagreb and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in Cologne with base pressures in the\nlow 10\u22128 Pa range using identical procedures for substrate\ncleaning and graphene fabrication. Graphene was prepared\non the clean Ir(111) surface by 7\u201315 cycles of room temperature ethene adsorption to saturation and subsequent thermal\ndecomposition at 1450 K. ARPES spectra have been taken at\n60 K by a Scienta SES-100 hemispherical electron analyzer\nwith an energy resolution of ~25 meV using 21.22 eV photons\nfrom a helium discharge source with a beam spot diameter of\nabout 2 mm. For the parallel momentum scan the polar angle \u03b8 ranged from 40\u25e6 to 70\u25e6 . The azimuthal angle, \u03c6, was\nchanged by a wobble stick and checked by LEED spot orientation with the precision of \u00b10.5\u25e6 . Below we show that for\na range of azimuths within a few degrees around the \u0393-K-M\ndirection, the absolute value of \u03c6 can be determined to a precision better than 0.1\u25e6 when the measured dispersion is fitted\nby the tight-binding approximation (TBA) bands of graphene\n[25].\n\nFor the epitaxially grown graphene where the substrate has\na different lattice constant, the stiffness of graphene leads\nto the formation of structures with large superperiodicity.\nSimulations within the effective-Hamiltonian formalism for\ngraphene subjected to superperiodic potentials suggest that\ngraphene superlattices could be used for tuning the propagation velocity and the density of charge carriers in graphene,\nwhich is of practical interest in building graphene based electronic components [23]. The main effect of a superperiodic\npotential on the band structure is the formation of minigaps\n\nGraphene on Ir(111) grows with graphene [1 1 2\u0304 0] and Ir\n[1 0 1\u0304] directions almost perfectly aligned. Due to the difference in lattice constants, a (9.32 \u00d7 9.32) moir\u00e9 with a repeat\ndistance of 2.53 nm is formed [21]. The low energy electron\ndiffraction (LEED) patterns \u2013 indistinguishable in appearance\nin our two setups \u2013 display aligned first order diffraction spots\nof the Ir surface and graphene lattices [arrows in Fig. 1(a)]\nsurrounded by the spots of the moir\u00e9. The relative position\nof the carbon atoms with respect to the iridium surface atoms\nchanges within the moir\u00e9 cell, giving rise to a contrast in STM\n\n\f2\n\nFigure 1: (color online). (a) LEED pattern (69 eV) of graphene on\nIr(111). First order Ir spots, C spots, as well as surrounding moir\u00e9\nspots are visible.

The amplitude and sign\nof the moir\u00e9 contrast depend on tunneling voltage [21], indicating its largely electronic origin. From images of higher\nmagnification [inset of Fig. 1(b)], which display the moir\u00e9\ncontrast together with the graphene lattice, the misalignment\nof graphene with respect to the substrate is accurately determined. Statistics for ~25 % graphene covered surface yields\na 0.25\u25e6 scatter in orientation between the two lattices. STM\nimaging of the surface covered up to 70 % by graphene shows\nflakes with lateral dimensions ranging from several hundred\nnanometers to a few micrometers. The structural perfection\nand insignificant orientation scatter (comparable with the 0.1\u25e6\nangular resolution of our electron analyzer) of graphene are a\nprerequisite for the successful application of ARPES.\nDue to the alignment of the graphene lattice and the Ir(111)\nsurface lattice their Brillouin zones (BZ) are aligned as well\n(cf. Fig. 3). The spectrum of clean Ir(111) along \u0393-K-M\nshown in Fig. 2(a) encompasses a region where the graphene\nDirac cone is expected. Conveniently, this region coincides\nwith an energy gap in the Ir(111) electronic structure. Three\nweakly dispersing states, which we identify as surface states,\nare clearly visible in the gap: S1 near the Fermi level, and S2\nand S3 passing near the low edge of the gap. The ARPES\nspectrum of graphene on Ir(111), shown in Fig. 2(b), contains all the features required to discuss the essential properties of graphene: (i) presence of a Dirac cone, (ii) marginal\ndoping, (iii) additional bands, and (iv) opening of minigaps.\nThe \u03c0-band with linear dispersion up to the Fermi level, the\nDirac cone, is visible at the graphene K-point [27]. The \u03c0band spectrum is sharp, with a full width at half maximum\n\u22121\nnot larger than 0.15 eV and 0.035 \u00c5 in the energy and\nmomentum distribution curves, respectively. The Dirac cone\nbranches have noticeably anisotropic intensity. The measured\nARPES \u03c0-band dispersion is accurately reproduced for all\nmeasured azimuths by the tight-binding approximation bands\nfor the unperturbed graphene described in [25], shifted in energy in order to obtain the best fit of the position of the main\nand replicated Dirac cones. According to this fit we estimate\nthe position of the Dirac point to be (0.10\u00b10.02) eV above the\n\nFigure 2: (color online).

S1 \u2013S3 are surface states.\n(b) ARPES spectrum of Ir(111) covered by graphene along the same\nazimuth as in (a). Horizontal arrows denote the minigap in the primary Dirac cone. A visible replica band is labeled as R. Detailed\nanalysis in [26]. (c),(d) ARPES spectra for \u03c6 = (1.4 \u00b1 0.1)\u25e6 and\n\u03c6 = (3.0 \u00b1 0.1)\u25e6 , respectively. The dashed lines are TBA calculated\nbands for Dirac cones located at positions 0, 1, 2, and 5 defined in\nFig. 3(b).\n\nFermi energy, i.e. graphene on Ir(111) is just slightly p-doped.\nAs the Dirac point is not accessible with ARPES, we are unable to judge whether a band gap opens at the Dirac point\nor not [28]. However, if there is one, it ought to be smaller\nthan twice the distance from the Fermi energy to the estimated\nDirac point, i.e. its width must be smaller than 0.20 eV. Besides the primary Dirac cone Fig. 2(b) displays an additional\nband, a faint replica labeled R. At the location where the band\nR intersects the Dirac cone in the \u0393-K branch [indicated by\na horizontal arrow in Fig. 2(b)] a band gap is visible, in the\nfollowing referred to as minigap. A minigap is also visible in\nthe K-M branch in the Dirac cone in Fig. 2(b).\nIn order to clarify the origin of the additional band R and the\nminigaps in Fig. 2(b) we show the Brillouin zones of graphene\nand Ir(111) in Fig. 3(a). The reciprocal lattice vectors GIr and\nGg of the Ir surface and graphene, respectively, give rise to\nthe moir\u00e9 reciprocal vectors Gm = Gg \u2212 GIr , the same which\ncreate the LEED pattern in Fig. 1(a). From the dependence of\nthe moir\u00e9 contrast on tunneling parameters [21] it is evident\nthat the electron potential of graphene is modulated by the\nsubstrate. This superperiodic potential, with the corresponding Gm vectors, creates replica bands centered at the points\nlabeled 1\u20136 in Fig. 3(b) and opens the gap in the Dirac cone\nalong the mini BZ (mBZ) boundary. For the \u0393-K-M experimental scan direction the cones 1 and 2 give rise to the hyperbolic band with the maximum centered at \u03ba [schematically\nshown in Fig. 3(b) and 3(c)], visible as the band R in Fig.\n2(b).

Its ARPES\ncut gets lower in energy, while the opposite happens for the\nreplicas whose vertex is approached, as exemplified for two\nazimuths in Figs. 2(c) and (d).\nReplica cones in epitaxial graphene may arise as a final\nstate effect through surface umklapp, involving the reciprocal Ir surface lattice vectors G1Ir and G2Ir [cf. Fig. 3 (a)] in\na momentum change of the photoelectron diffracted at the\nsurface. This mechanism was put forward in explaining the\nnature of replicas in graphene on SiC(0001) where, contrary\nto our observation, the replica cone intensity disappeared at\nroom temperature [8]. Consistent with this interpretation no\ngaps at the intersection of primary and replica cones were observed [7, 8]. Thus, the presence of superperiodic contrast in\nSTM topographs of graphene on SiC(0001) is then to be interpreted as a purely geometric height modulation [29]. Though\nwe cannot exclude final state contributions to the intensity of\n\nthe replica cones, the surface umklapp alone cannot create the\nminigap reported here. Therefore, we consider the presence of\nthe minigap as an evidence for an initial state effect in ARPES,\ni.e. the existence of a moir\u00e9 periodic potential. The analysis of\nARPES spectra reveals that the minigap is indeed located on\nthe Bragg planes bounding the mBZ (Fig. 4). The measured\ngap width is in the range 0.1\u20130.2 eV. Consequently, the amplitude of the moir\u00e9 potential is of the order of 0.05\u20130.10 eV,\nsmall compared to the \u03c0-band width. No closing of the minigap was observed. Note that a model using a long-wavelength\nsuperperiodic potential which does not break the symmetry of\nthe two graphene sublattices opens a minigap which vanishes\nat specific points of the boundary of the superstructure BZ, but\ndoes not open the gap at the Dirac point [23].\nThe symmetry breaking as a consequence of the inequivalence of two carbon atoms within each unit cell of graphene\nought to imply opening of a band gap at the Dirac point [30],\nand lifting of the complete asymmetry of the ARPES intensity\n[8, 31]. A bandgap due to symmetry breaking has been clearly\nobserved in the bilayer and few layer graphene on SiC(0001)\n[7, 8] but it remains under debate for monolayer graphene on\nthe same substrate [9, 10]. A detailed analysis of the moir\u00e9\nof graphene on Ir(111) shows that the atoms in the two sublattices of graphene are locally and globally inequivalent [21].\nThe global inequivalence reveals itself through the fact that Ir\nclusters formed on graphene [32, 33] bind only to the areas\nof the moir\u00e9 where the carbon atoms of one sublattice sit atop\nof substrate iridium atoms. Our ARPES spectra show visible\nasymmetry of the photoemission intensity, which along with\nthe estimate of a small gap at the Dirac point (< 0.2 eV) indicates that the effects of the symmetry breaking for graphene\non iridium are small.\nAs one of the most prominent features, the Dirac cone of\ngraphene on Ir(111) shows no sign of hybridization with substrate electronic bands. Consistently, density functional theory (DFT) calculations taking into account the large supercell\nof graphene on Ir(111) suggest a weak bonding of graphene\n[32, 33]. In particular, DFT calculations yield a large aver-\n\n\f4\nage graphene \u2013 Ir(111) separation of 0.34 nm [33], which also\nexplains the defect free growth of the graphene flakes over\nstep edges [20]. Our measurements suggest that the weakness of bonding can be ascribed to the dearth of metallic states\nof appropriate symmetry (i.e., the existence of the band gap)\naround the K-point of the surface BZ of Ir(111). Marginal pdoping comes out as a fortuitous match of several system parameters: proper graphene \u2013 Ir(111) distance, work function\ndifference, and weak chemical bonding [34].\nOur experiments single out graphene on Ir(111) as a system with unique properties as compared with other epitaxially grown graphene systems. In distinction to graphene on\nNi(111) [15, 16] and Ru(0001) [17, 18, 19] it is a weakly interacting graphene. In distinction to graphene on SiC(0001)\n[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 29, 30] and two-layer graphene on Ru(0001)\n[19] it is a simple system with no carbon rich intermediate\nlayer necessary to passivate the substrate. It is this simplicity,\ntogether with its unparalleled structural quality, which makes\nit an attractive candidate for model experiments. To give an\nexample, for graphene on Ir(111) there is a straightforward\nmethod to vary the strength of the moir\u00e9 periodic potential\nthrough ordered adsorption of small metal clusters of well defined size into the moir\u00e9 [32], allowing one experiments on\ncharge carrier manipulation through periodic potentials [23].\nIn conclusion, our ARPES measurements show that the\nelectronic bands of graphene on Ir(111) near the Fermi level\nhave the form of the Dirac cone of pristine graphene, only\nslightly shifted to lower binding energies due to a marginal\np-doping by the substrate. The periodic potential associated\nwith the moir\u00e9 gives rise to the formation of replica cones and\nminigaps at the Bragg planes between the primary and replica\ncones. The simplicity of the system and its desirable structural\nand electronic properties make it interesting for fundamental\nresearch and a candidate for graphene-metal contacts in potential applications of graphene in electronics.\nM.
