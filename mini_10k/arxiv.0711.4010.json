The optical light curves of both sources show\nsubstantial (\u223c 0.5 \u2212 0.8 mag) changes over the time span of the observations. While\nthe optical data for SXP6.85 do not reveal any periodic behaviour, by detrending the\noptical measurements for SXP46.6 we find an orbital period of \u223c 137 days, consistent with results from the X-ray data. The detection of Type I X-ray outbursts from\nSXP46.6, combined with the fact that we also see optical outbursts at these times,\nimplies that SXP46.6 is a high orbital eccentricity system. Using contemporaneous\noptical spectra of SXP46.6 we find that the equivalent width of the H\u03b1 emission line\nchanges over time indicating that the size of the circumstellar disc varies. By studying\nthe history of the colour variations for SXP6.85 we find that the source gets redder\nas it brightens which can also be attributed to changes in the circumstellar disc. We\ndo not find any correlation between the X-ray and optical data for SXP6.85. The\nresults for SXP6.85 suggest that it is a low eccentricity binary and that the optical\nmodulations are due to the Be phenomenon.\nKey words: X-rays: binaries \u2013 stars: emission-line, Be \u2013 (galaxies:) Magellanic Clouds\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nObservations of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) at multiwavelengths have uncovered numerous high-mass X-ray binaries, the majority of which are Be/X-ray transients (see\ne.g. Haberl & Pietsch 2004; Coe et al. 2005; McGowan et al.\n2007). These systems comprise of an OB star and a neutron\nstar. As the compact object orbits the companion star in\na wide and eccentric orbit it passes close to the circumstellar disc of the Be star and X-ray outbursts are seen\n(Okazaki & Negueruela 2001). In some cases optical outbursts coincident with the X-ray outbursts are also detected\n(see e.g. Alcock et al. 2001; Coe & Edge 2004).\nRXTE monitoring is providing a wealth of information\non the X-ray pulsars in the SMC (see e.g. Laycock et al.\n2005; Galache et al. 2007). However, to investigate the\nsources in detail, in particular at multi-wavelengths, more\nprecise locations must be determined, via e.g. Chandra and\nXMM-Newton.\nIn this paper we present observations and analysis of op-\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: kem@astro.soton.ac.uk\n\nFigure 1.

Only X-ray data with identical\ncollimator responses (see text) and covering the time of overlap with the optical data have been plotted. The times corresponding to the\norbital period determined from the RXTE data, P = 137.74 d, are marked (dashed lines).\n\n2\n\nSXP46.6 = XTE J0053-724 = 1WGA\n0053.8-7226\n\nSXP46.6 was discovered in 1997 during observations of the\nSMC with RXTE (Marshall et al. 1997). A position for\nthe source was obtained from follow-up ASCA observations, leading to the object being identified with an archival\nROSAT source. The ASCA measurements also revealed possible pulsations at \u223c 92 s (Corbet et al. 1997). Further analysis of the ASCA and RXTE data established a pulse period for the source of 46.6 s (Corbet et al. 1998). Studies of\nROSAT observations confirmed the transient nature of the\nsource (Buckley et al. 2001, and references therein). Due to\nthe uncertainty on the X-ray position Buckley et al. (2001)\nproposed two optical sources as the counterpart to SXP46.6.\nThe characteristics of both optical candidates were similar\nand led to the conclusion that the system was a Be/X-ray\nbinary.\nRXTE has continued to monitor SXP46.6 over the past\n10 years, the results of which are presented in Galache et al.\n(2007). During this time the source has exhibited regular\noutbursts allowing an orbital period of 137.36 \u00b1 0.35 d and\nan outburst ephemeris of MJD 52293.9 \u00b1 1.4 to be derived\n(Galache et al. 2007, based on nine years of data). Adding\nthe most recent data we determine a refined period and time\nof maximum flux of 137.74 \u00b1 0.42 d and MJD 52430.3 \u00b1 1.4,\nrespectively.\nWe have analysed archival Chandra ACIS data covering\nthe region of SXP46.6 (see also McBride et al. 2007). The\nACIS observations were taken on 2002 July 20, 2006 April\n25 and 2006 April 26 and had exposure times of 7.7 ks,\n49.3 ks and 47.4 ks, respectively. We processed the data using the Chandra analysis package CIAO V3.4. The event files\nwere filtered to restrict the energy range to 0.5\u20138.0 keV and\nwe searched for sources using the wavelet analysis algorithm.\nWe detect an X-ray source coincident with one of the optical\ncandidates, Star B from Buckley et al. (2001), in all three\nChandra observations. The X-ray position of the source is\n\nRA = 00h 53m 55.s 22, Dec. = \u221272\u25e6 26\u2032 45.\u2032\u2032 7. The measured\ncounts in the three Chandra observations are 7, 38 and 28\ncounts, respectively, corresponding to X-ray luminosities of\n4.6 \u00d7 1033 , 4.1 \u00d7 1033 and 3.1 \u00d7 1033 erg s\u22121 , assuming a\ndistance to the SMC of 60 kpc (based on the distance modulus, Westerlund 1997). Using the most recent orbital period\nand ephemeris from RXTE we find that all three Chandra\nobservations were taken at outburst phase \u223c 0.3 (see also\nFigure 4). The low flux detected with Chandra can be explained by the phases at which the measurements occurred.\nA search for pulsations was not possible due to the lack of\nsource counts.\n2.1\n\nOptical light curve\n\nWhile the source is not in the OGLE II or MACHO catalogues, it is clearly detected in the more extensive OGLE III\nsurvey. OGLE III, whose data are not yet public, is a continuation of the OGLE project (Udalski, Kubiak & Szyma\u0144ski\n1997; Szyma\u0144ski 2005). We show in Figure 1 OGLE III photometry for Star B, from 2001 June 26 to 2007 January 28.\nThe optical light curve displays a large variation in brightness (\u223c 0.5 mag) over the six years of observations, typical\nof Be stars (Mennickent et al. 2002).\nAs the large-scale modulations present in the OGLE\nIII light curve are clearly not periodic, before we searched\nfor coherent variations we removed the long-term changes.\nThe data were split into eight sections and each section\nwas detrended separately by subtracting a linear fit. We\nthen searched the detrended light curve (see Figure 2, top\npanel) for periodicities in the range 2\u20131000 d using LombScargle (LS) and phase dispersion minimization (PDM) periodograms.\nThe results of the temporal analysis are shown in Figure 3. The dominant peak in the LS periodogram occurs at\nP = 136.11 \u00b1 2.27 d, with a corresponding dip in the PDM\nperiodogram at P = 135.73 \u00b1 2.26 d. The second largest\npeak (dip) in the periodograms (at \u223c 220 d) is due to this\n\n\fOptical and X-ray variability of SXP46.6 and SXP6.85\n\nFigure 3. Phase dispersion minimisation (top) and Lomb-Scargle\nperiodograms (bottom) for the detrended OGLE III data of\nSXP46.6. The strongest dip in the former corresponds to a period\nof 135.73 d, with the highest peak at 136.11 d in the latter.\n\n3\n\nFigure 4. Detrended OGLE III (top) and RXTE data (bottom)\nfor SXP46.6.

The \u223c 136\nd period from the LS and PDM searches are, within errors,\nconsistent with each other and the period found using the\nmost recent RXTE data. This confirms that Star B is the\ncorrect counterpart to SXP46.6.\n\n2.2\n\nX-ray light curve\n\nBefore analysis of the RXTE light curves can be performed\nthe raw data are filtered to include only Good Xenon measurements from the top anode layer. Light curves are generated in the 3\u201310 keV energy band with 0.01 s time bins and\nthe detected count rate is divided by the number of Proportional Counter Units (PCUs) that were active at each\ntime stamp. Each PCU has a collimator, the result of which\nis that each unit has approximately the same field of view.\nDue to small variations between the PCUs the source count\nrates must be corrected for the collimator response. Only observations with the same pointing position have been used\nin the following analysis. For more details on the data reduction see Galache et al. (2007).\nTo investigate possible correlations between the optical\nand X-ray data, we show in Figure 2 the detrended OGLE\nIII light curve for SXP46.6 (top panel) and the RXTE light\ncurve (in units of counts PCU\u22121 s\u22121 , bottom panel). Only\nX-ray data with identical collimator responses and covering\nthe time of overlap with the optical data have been plotted.\nWe have also plotted, as dashed lines, the times of expected\nX-ray outburst using the orbital period and ephemeris found\nusing the most recent RXTE data. It is clear from the figure\n\nFigure 5. Spin-up of SXP46.6 over the last 10 years, from RXTE\nmonitoring.\n\nthat the optical light curve displays outbursts, with amplitudes of \u223c 0.04 mag, coincident with the X-ray outbursts.\nWe have folded the detrended OGLE III data and the\nRXTE data on P = 137.74 d using T0 = MJD 52430.3.\nThe folded light curves show that the modulation is highly\nnon-sinusoidal, with the peak emission in the X-ray data\ncoinciding with the peak in the optical data (Figure 4). It\nis also apparent that both the X-ray and optical outbursts\nare short-lived, occupying only a small fraction of the orbital phase. There is a suggestion that the optical peak is\nactually split in two. To investigate this we divided the light\n\n\f4\n\nK. E. McGowan et al.\nTable 1.

In general the source\nhas been spinning-up over that time frame, with an overall\nrate of change of spin period of \u1e56 = \u22121.2 \u00d7 10\u22129 ss\u22121 . The\ntransfer of angular momentum to the neutron star from orbiting material as it is accreted is thought to be responsible\nfor the spin-up (Ghosh & Lamb 1979). The luminosity required to achieve the measured spin-up is 1.2 \u00d7 1036 erg s\u22121 .\nThere is evidence that the rate of spin-up has slowed, with a\nnoticeable flattening off in period change, since MJD 53000\n(see Figure 5). This coincides with the lower H\u03b1 equivalent\nwidths measured in the optical spectra (see Section 2.4) and\nthe diminishing size of the optical outbursts (see Figure 2).\n\n2.4\n\nOptical spectra\n\nSpectra of the optical counterpart of SXP46.6 have been\ntaken on several occasions using the 1.9 m telescope at\nSAAO, South Africa. A log of the observations is given in\nTable 1. The unit spectrograph was used with a 1200 line\nmm\u22121 grating, giving a dispersion of \u223c 0.4\u00c5/pixel. We also\nobtained a lower resolution spectrum of the source using\nthe ESO faint object spectrograph and camera (EFOSC2)\nmounted on the 3.6 m telescope at La Silla, Chile. A 600\nline mm\u22121 grating was used giving a dispersion of 2\u00c5/pixel.\nThe SAAO and ESO data were reduced using standard IRAF\npackages. The SAAO spectra are plotted in Figure 6. It is\nclear that the profile of the H\u03b1 emission is changing with\ntime; the equivalent widths are given in Table 1. The variations in H\u03b1 are likely due to variations in the circumstellar\ndisc of the Be star.\n\n3\n\nSXP6.85 = XTE J0103-728\n\nX-ray emission, pulsed at 6.8482 s, was first detected from\nSXP6.85 in 2003 with RXTE (Corbet et al. 2003). Continued RXTE observations spanning two months in 2003\ndisplayed the transient nature of the source (Corbet et al.\n2003). A further five detections have been made during the\n10 year monitoring campaign of the SMC with RXTE (see\nGalache et al. 2007). Temporal analysis of the X-ray data\nby Galache et al. (2007) revealed a period at 112.5 d, but\nit is not clear if this represents a true modulation or if\nthis value is driven by the interval between two major outbursts. SXP6.85 was detected in an XMM-Newton observation in 2006 leading to the identification of the source\nwith a V = 14.6 Be star (Haberl et al. 2007). Independently,\nSchmidtke & Cowley (2007) analysed MACHO and OGLE\nII data for the source finding that the optical brightness varied over a timescale of \u223c 658 d. They also find a possible\nperiod in the OGLE II data of 24.82 d.\n3.1\n\nOptical light curve\n\nA search of the MACHO (Alcock et al. 1999) and OGLE II\ndatabases (Udalski, Kubiak & Szyma\u0144ski 1997; Szyma\u0144ski\n2005) provided optical photometry for SXP6.85. The MACHO project generated simultaneous photometry in two\npassbands, a red band (\u223c 6300 \u2212 7600 \u00c5) and a blue band\n(\u223c 4500 \u2212 6300 \u00c5), both measured in instrumental magnitudes. We have also obtained the OGLE III data for the\nsource. In Figure 7 (top panel) we show the combined MACHO blue, OGLE II and OGLE III light curves of the source,\nfrom 1992 August 18 to 2007 January 28. In order to display\nthe data on the same scale we had to shift the MACHO blue\ndata by +24.82 mag, and the OGLE III data by \u22120.3 mag,\nboth with respect to the OGLE II data.\nThe combined light curve displays large variations in\nbrightness over the \u223c14.5 years of observations. To determine whether these changes are periodic we searched the\ndata for coherent modulations in the range 2\u20131000 d using LS and PDM periodograms. Both periodograms show a\nstrong peak (dip) at \u223c 620 \u00b1 18 d, however the folded light\ncurve indicates that the variations are quasi-periodic (Figure\n8). This is similar to the value found by Schmidtke & Cowley\n(2007).\nUsing a similar analysis to SXP46.6, we detrended the\ncombined light curve of SXP6.85 by splitting it into several sections and then subtracted a linear fit from each sec-\n\n\fOptical and X-ray variability of SXP46.6 and SXP6.85\n\n5\n\nFigure 7. The combined MACHO blue, OGLE II and OGLE III light curves (top) and RXTE light curve of SXP6.85 (bottom). The\nMACHO blue data have been shifted by +24.82 mag, and the OGLE III data by \u22120.3 mag, both with respect to the OGLE II data.\nThe optical error bars are smaller than the plotted symbols.\n\nFigure 8. Combined light curve of SXP6.85 folded on P = 620.68\nd.\n\ntion. We then performed a period search with LS and PDM\nperiodograms, again over the range 2\u20131000 d. Both periodograms show several large peaks (dips), with the highest\npeak in the LS periodogram occurring at 114.07 \u00b1 0.62 d,\nand the corresponding PDM dip at 114.01 \u00b1 0.62 d. There\nis a smaller peak (dip) at 25.86 d which is close to the value\nreported by Schmidtke & Cowley (2007). However, due to\nthe large aperiodic changes in the raw data it is likely that\nthese peaks (dips) are spurious and do not represent true\nperiodic behaviour. We find that the amplitudes of the variations in the detrended light curves folded on these values\nare < 0.01 mag.\n\n3.2\n\nX-ray light curve\n\nThe RXTE light curve of SXP6.85 was generated in the same\nway as for SXP46.6 (see Section 2.2). We show in Figure 7\n(bottom panel) the RXTE light curve of SXP6.85. There\ndoes not appear to be any obvious correlation between the\n\nFigure 9. MACHO red light curve (top) and MACHO blue \u2212 red\ncolour variations over time (bottom) for SXP6.85. Note that the\nsource gets redder as it gets brighter.\n\nX-ray outbursts and the raw optical data (Figure 7, top\npanel) or with the detrended optical data (not shown).\n\n3.3\n\nColour variations\n\nWe show in Figure 9 how the colour of SXP6.85 varies over\ntime compared to the MACHO red data. It can be seen\nthat as the source brightens it gets redder. This indicates\nthat the variations in the light curve are likely to be caused\nby changes in the structure of the circumstellar disc around\nthe Be star. This is due to the disc being redder in B \u2212 V\n(i.e. cooler) than the Be star (Janot-Pacheco et al. 1987).\nThus, the formation of the circumstellar disc will increase\nthe optical brightness of the system by the addition of red\nlight, or it will make the system appear fainter by masking\nthe Be star, behaviour that is dependant on the inclination\nof the system. It is interesting to note that the shape of the\n\n\f6\n\nK. E. McGowan et al.\n\ncolour changes do not exactly mirror the variations in the\nred light curve.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nDISCUSSION\nSXP46.6\n\nThe optical light curve of SXP46.6 displays long-term variations that are most likely due to the formation and depletion of the Be star's circumstellar disc. It is reasonable\nto assume, if the equatorial plane of the Be star coincides\nwith the orbital plane of the compact object, that as the\nneutron star orbits close to this disc at periastron X-ray\noutbursts should be observed. Our results show that not\nonly do we detect X-ray outbursts, but optical outbursts\nare also seen. SXP46.6 is therefore one of only a handful of systems that displays optical bursts at the binary\nperiod (see e.g. Alcock et al. 2001; Schmidtke et al. 2003;\nCowley & Schmidtke 2003; Coe & Edge 2004; Edge et al.\n2005). We find that the amplitude of the optical outbursts\n(\u223c 0.04 mag) is similar to those of other sources (see e.g.\nSchmidtke et al. 2003; Cowley & Schmidtke 2003).\nIn Be/X-ray transients in general, the depletion of the\ncircumstellar disc leads to a decrease in the optical brightness of the system. For SXP46.6, even when the optical light\ncurve goes into a sharp decline there must be a residual\ndisc present as outbursts, both at optical and X-ray wavelengths, are seen. In contrast, as the optical brightness recovers, which would normally be attributed to the disc reforming, an X-ray outburst is evident but there does not\nappear to be a corresponding burst in the optical. The reason for this is unclear, but could possibly be related to the\namount of material in the circumstellar disc available for accretion and the quantity that is transferred to the neutron\nstar. If less matter is accreted the optical outbursts could\nhave a lower amplitude and may not be detectable above\nthe intrinsic variability in the optical light curve. Another\npossibility for the lack of an optical outburst at this time\nis that there remains a wind that is sufficient to generate\nX-ray outbursts only.\nUsing the H\u03b1 equivalent width as an indicator for the\ncircumstellar disc size (Dachs et al. 1986), we find that for\nthe first three years of OGLE III monitoring the disc size is\nincreasing, anti-correlated with the optical brightness. Unfortunately we do not have spectra during the optical minimum. After the optical minimum the equivalent width of\nthe H\u03b1 emission line seems to reflect the recovery of the circumstellar disc, with the width of the line increasing as the\noptical brightness increases. The anti-correlated behaviour\ninitially may be due to the disc covering part of the Be star\nleading to a reduction in brightness. This has been seen in\nanother source, A 0538-66 (Alcock et al. 2001). It is unfortunate that we do not have multi-band data that would allow\nus to investigate the colours of the source at these times.\nThe shape of the optical and X-ray outbursts for\nSXP46.6 are both asymmetric, with a faster rise and slower\ndecline, reminiscent of other Be/X-ray binaries (see e.g.\nAlcock et al. 2001; Coe & Edge 2004). We propose that the\noptical bursts could be due to the circumstellar disc being\nperturbed at each passage causing the disc to grow slightly,\nleading to an enhancement in the optical brightness. We can\n\ncalculate a rough estimate for this increase in brightness. If\nwe assume that the 0.5 magnitude global change in the light\ncurve represents the difference between no disc and a full\ndisc, then this corresponds to an increase in light of 58%.\nThe optical outbursts we detect have an amplitude of \u223c 0.04\nmag, which equals a total increase from no disc of 64%. Assuming that the increase in brightness is equivalent to the\ndisc size, then during outburst the disc grows by \u223c 10%.\nWe note that the increase in optical brightness at outburst\nmay not be due to geometric effects alone. We find that the\nluminosity of the optical outbursts is \u223c 3 \u00d7 1034 erg s\u22121 and\nthe luminosity of the X-ray outbursts is \u223c 2 \u00d7 1036 erg s\u22121 .\nThis implies that reprocessing could be contributing to the\nchange in the optical light.\nStella et al. (1986) distinguished between the various\nkinds of X-ray behaviour observed from Be/X-ray binaries, placing them into three groups: (i) persistent, low-level\n(quiescent) emission, (ii) relatively bright, short-lived outbursts recurring on the orbital period at the time of periastron passage, known as Type I, and (iii) large, longlived (weeks to months) outbursts that occur irregularly,\nknown as Type II. We are most likely detecting quiescent emission from SXP46.6 in the Chandra observations.\nOkazaki & Negueruela (2001) have shown that the class of\nX-ray outbursts detected from a Be/X-ray transient, Type\nI and/or Type II, is dependent on the orbital eccentricity of\nthe system, and the viscosity of the disc. The disc in binaries with low eccentricity is truncated at the 3:1 resonance\nradius. This means that too little material is captured (if\nany) by the compact object as it orbits the Be star as the\ndisc is too far away. Therefore, regular Type I outbursts\ncannot be produced by these systems, but they may show\ninfrequent Type II outbursts. In contrast, periodic Type I\noutbursts are generated in high eccentricity binaries as the\ndisc is truncated at a larger resonance radius, which permits\nmaterial to be accreted by the neutron star every orbit. The\ndetection of Type I X-ray outbursts from SXP46.6, and the\ncorresponding optical outbursts, and its similarity to other\nsources that have shown optical outbursts on the orbital period, implies that SXP46.6 has a high orbital eccentricity.\n4.2\n\nSXP6.85\n\nThe long-term optical light curve of SXP6.85 is similar to\nthat of SXP46.6 in the fact that the large changes observed\nare not periodic, leading to the conclusion that they are\nrelated to the Be phenomenon. The variations in the source's\ncolour support this. Even after detrending, we find little\nevidence for any coherent modulations in the optical light\ncurve of SXP6.85.\nAnalysis of SXP6.85's X-ray light curve does not\nfirmly demonstrate the presence of periodic behaviour either (Galache et al. 2007). More data are needed to confirm\nthe tentative orbital period proposed. There is a lack of correlation between the optical and X-ray data. By comparing\nthe two datasets we find that one X-ray outburst occurs\njust prior to optical maximum, while another two seem to\noccur as the optical source is fading. This implies that the\nneutron star is not accreting directly from the stellar wind,\nand could indicate that the X-ray emission is triggered by\ndiscrete episodes of disc material being lost radially (see e.g.\nClark et al. 1999).\n\n\fOptical and X-ray variability of SXP46.6 and SXP6.85\nThe characteristics of SXP6.85 are very similar to\nthose of EXO 0531-66 and H 0544-665 (McGowan & Charles\n2002). All three sources are highly variable in the optical\nover long timescales but do not show variations that are orbital in origin, they become redder as they brighten in the\noptical and no strong correlation is found between the X-ray\nand optical measurements. Due to the similarities of these\nsources, and with comparison to SXP46.6, we therefore propose that SXP6.85 is a low eccentricity system.\n\n5\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe find that the long-term optical light curve of SXP46.6\ndisplays regular outbursts that are coincident with the Xray outbursts, both modulated on a period of \u223c 137 d. The\nbehaviour of SXP46.6 indicates that it has a high orbital eccentricity. Our results from optical spectra of SXP46.6 imply\nthat the Be star's circumstellar disc varies in size over the\nyears. We do not find any periodic modulations in the optical light curve of SXP6.85, but our analysis does show that\nas the source brightens it gets redder. It is therefore likely\nthat the changes in the light curve and the colour variations\nare due to the formation and depletion of the circumstellar\ndisc. The lack of correlated X-ray and optical activity for\nSXP6.85 suggests that it is a low eccentricity system.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nSupport for OGLE was provided by the Polish MNiSW grant\nN20303032/4275.
