It is the region where the confinement-deconfinement phase transition is\nexpected in the pure-glue or quenched variants of the theory, and where chiral symmetry restoration is believed to occur in the full version, with light dynamical fermions. Pure-glue theories\nwithout dynamical quarks have the advantage that one can characterize the order parameter and\nget insight into many interesting aspects of the phase transition [1, 2, 3, 4]. To get a good theoretical understanding of what is going on below and above the phase transitions and to understand\nthe microscopic mechanism of the transitions themselves, is one of the greatest challenges in QCD.\nUnfortunately, the present theoretical tools to handle these problems are insufficient: there\nare a precious few well-based statements about high and intermediate temperatures. At very\nhigh temperatures the perturbation theory in the running coupling constant can be developed.\nEspecially the hard-thermal-loop resummation method [5] proved essential. However, perturbation theory necessarily explodes already in a few-loop approximation due to the nonperturbative\nchromomagnetic sector of non-Abelian gauge theories [1, 6, 7], thus limiting the applicability of\nperturbation theory to academically high temperatures [8]. The 1-loop [7, 9] and 2-loop [10] potential energies as functions of the 'time' Yang\u2013Mills component A4 are known, which are periodic\nfunctions with a period 2\u03c0T of the eigenvalues of A4 in the adjoint representation. The curvature\nof this potential gives the Debye mass. The potential has zero-energy minima for quantized values\nof A4 corresponding to the Polyakov line assuming values from the center of the gauge group. At\nhigh temperatures the system oscillates around one of those trivial values of the Polyakov line.\nAt lower temperatures the fluctuations in the values of the Polyakov line increase and eventually\nthe system undergoes a transition to the phase with Tr P = 0, known as the confinement phase.\nTo study this phase transition or at least to approach it from the high-temperature side, one\nneeds to know the effective action for the Polyakov line in the whole range of its possible variation.\nEffective Lagrangians for A4 at high temperatures have been constructed and studied by a number\nof authors [11, 12], however, the 1-loop kinetic energy for the Polyakov line is unknown. One of\nthe aims of this paper is to find it.\nLet us formulate the problem more mathematically. Nonzero temperatures explicitly break the\n4D Euclidean symmetry of the theory down to the 3D Euclidean symmetry, so that the spatial\nAi and time A4 components of the Yang\u2013Mills field play different roles and should be treated\ndifferently. One can always choose a gauge where A4 is time-independent. Taking A4 (x) to be\nstatic is not a restriction of any kind on the fields but merely a convenient gauge choice, and we\nshall imply this gauge throughout the paper. [It is also a possible gauge choice at T = 0 but\nin that limiting case it is unnatural as one usually wishes to preserve the 4D symmetry.] As to\nthe spatial components Ai (x, t), they are, generally speaking, timedependent, although periodic\nin the time direction. Putting the components Ai to zero is a gauge noninvariant restriction on\nthe fields since any time-independent gauge transformation will generate a nonzero Ai . Therefore,\nthe spatial derivatives of the Polyakov line in the gauge-invariant effective action can only appear\nas covariant derivatives including a nonzero Ai field.\nThe effective action studied in this paper is a functional of the background static A4 field\nand, generally speaking, nonstatic Ai fields, obtained by integrating out fast-varying quantum\noscillations about the background. The key ingredient is that we do not assume A4 to be small\nbut sum up all powers in A4 . Therefore we are actually computing the effective action for the\n2\n\n\fPolyakov loop interacting, in a covariant way, with the spatial Ai fields. The resulting effective\naction has to be invariant with respect to time-independent gauge transformations and also with\nrespect to certain residual timedependent gauge transformations which do not induce nonstatic\nA4 and support the periodicity of Ai (x, t); they will be discussed at the end of the paper.\nAn economic and aesthetic method of getting explicitly gauge invariant actions is based on\nthe evaluation of functional determinants. [An equivalent method is computing 1-loop Feynman\ngraphs with arbitrary number of external legs, however it is technically more involved and does\nnot automatically support gauge invariance with respect to the external field.] In this case, the\nevaluation of functional determinants is nontrivial as we expand it in the (covariant) derivatives\nof the field but sum up all powers of the amplitude of A4 . We develop a general technique for\nthe covariant derivative expansion which, in principle, can be worked out to any power of the\nderivatives. In this paper, however, we find explicit expressions for the action with 0,2 and 4\ncovariant derivatives. This enables us to find the leading terms both in the electric and magnetic\nsectors of the theory.\nSince 4D Euclidean invariance is broken by nonzero temperature the electric and magnetic\nfield strengths appear differently in the action. The magnetic field strength is\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\nBia = \u01ebijk \u2202j Aak \u2212 \u2202k Aaj + \u01ebabc Abj Ack ,\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhereas the electric field strength consists of two pieces, the 'static' and the 'dynamical':\nEia = Diab Ab4 \u2212 \u0226ai = \u2202i Aa4 + \u01ebacb Aci Ab4 \u2212 \u0226ai .\n\n(2)\n\nIn the SU(2) gauge theory to which we mostly restrict ourselves in the present paper there are\nonly a few gauge and Euclidean 3D invariants in the order we are interested in. These are Aa4 Aa4 ,\nEia Eia , Bia Bia and (Eia Aa4 )2 , (Bia Aa4 )2 . [For higher gauge groups there will be more invariants.] The\neffective action (tree plus 1-loop) has the form\nSeff =\n\u03bd =\n\nZ\n\n\"\n\n#\n\n(Ei A4 )2\n(Bi A4 )2\nd3 x\n4\n2\n2\n\u2212T V (\u03bd)+Ei F1 (\u03bd)+\nF2 (\u03bd) + Bi H1 (\u03bd)+\nH2 (\u03bd)+. . . ,\nT\nA24\nA24\n\n(3)\n\n\u221a\n\nAa4 Aa4\n.\n2\u03c0T\n\nThe static potential V (\u03bd) has been known for 20 years [7, 9]; the functions F1,2 , H1,2 are the\nnew findings of this paper: they turn out to be quite nontrivial and can be expressed through the\ndigamma \u03c8 functions. The Ei2 A24 and Bi2 A24 terms of the effective action (corresponding to the first\nterms of the Taylor expansion of our functions) have been known before [13] and one combination\n(actually F1 + F2 in our notations) was actually found previously by considering a particular case\nof Ai = 0 [14]. We agree with this previous work, however our results are, of course, more general.\nIn addition to the structures in eq. (3) we have found a full-derivative term in the effective action.\nThis term is not necessarily zero: if the background field does not fall off fast enough at spatial\ninfinity it gives a finite contribution. This is, e.g., the case when the background field is that of\nthe BPS dyon [15].\nActually, quantum determinants are UV divergent, giving rise to the renormalization of the\nbare coupling constant of the tree action. We perform an accurate regularization of the determinants by means of the Pauli\u2013Villars scheme. As a result, the above functions are finite and the\n3\n\n\f\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nT\n11\nconst. where \u039b is the QCD scale\nF1 , H1 functions contain the running-coupling terms 24\u03c0\n2 ln\n\u039b\nin a particular regularization scheme. We have determined the value of the 'const.' in the argument of the logarithm and hence have learned the precise scale of the running coupling constant\nat which it needs to be evaluated.\n\u0010\n\u0011Changing the regularization scheme means the substitution\n1\n3\u03c0 2\n\u039bPV = e 22 \u039bMS = 40.66 * exp \u2212 11N\n\u039bLat = . . . [16].\n2\nThere are two different approaches to the effective action and correspondingly two different\nvariants of the resulting functions F1,2 ... One can either exclude or include the contribution of the\nstatic (zero Matsubara frequency) fluctuations to the effective action. One follows the former logic\nif one wishes to get the effective action for static modes only. In this case the potential energy\nV (A4 ) is not periodic and moreover it is formally UV divergent. One follows the latter logic if\none is interested, e.g., in finding full quantum corrections to semiclassical field configurations at\nnonzero temperatures, the examples of such being dyons [17] and calorons [18]. We compute the\nfunctions F1,2 and H1,2 in both variants.\nCorrespondingly, we think of two kinds of applications of our results. One is for studying\nthe fluctuations and correlation functions of the Polyakov line in the region of temperatures\nwhere its average deviates considerably from the perturbative center-of-group values and where\nthe dimensional reduction (i.e. perturbative) approximation fails. Another application is for\nevaluating the weights of semiclassical objects appearing at nonzero temperature [19].\n\n2\n\nBasics of Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature\n\nThe general definition of the partition function for statistical systems is\nZ =\n=\n\nX\nn\n\n\u2212\u03b2H\n\nhn e\n\nXZ\nn\n\n1\n\u03b2=\nT\n\n\u0015\n\n\u03c8n (q) =\n\nZ\n\n\u0014\n\nni\n\ndq \u03c8n\u2217 (q)\n\n\u2212\u03b2En\n\ne\n\n(4)\ndq0\n\nZ\n\nq(\u03b2)=q0\n\nq(0)=q0\n\nDq(t) exp \u2212\n\nZ\n\no\n\n\u03b2\n\n!\n\ndtH[q, q\u0307] ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere H is the Hamiltonian of the system, and En are its eigenvalues.

In the absence of external sources it means that only those states need to\nbe taken into account that are invariant under gauge transformations:\nAi (x) \u2192 [Ai (x)]\u03a9(x) = \u03a9(x)\u2020 Ai (x) \u03a9(x) + i\u03a9(x)\u2020 \u2202i \u03a9(x),\n\u03a9(x) = exp{i \u03c9a (x)ta } .\n4\n\n(8)\n\n\fTo restrict the summation to physical states, one has to modify eq. (7). One projects to the\nphysical i.e. gauge invariant states by averaging the initial and final configurations over gauge\nrotations.

(10). If one does, it means that only states with total color charge\nzero are admitted in the partition function. A more cautious approach is to allow for states with\nnonzero color charge: if these are for some reasons dynamically suppressed it must be seen from\nthe theory but not imposed by hand. Therefore we shall admit x-independent \u03a9's but not integrate\nover them explicitly.\nIn order to put the partition function into a more customary four dimensional form one introduces an interpolating gauge transformation \u03a9(x4 , x) such that\n\u03a9(x4 , x) =\n\n(\n\n1,\nx4 = 0,\n.\n\u03a9(x), x4 = \u03b2\n\n(11)\n\nSimultaneously one changes the integration variables from Ai (x4 , x) to\nA\u2032i (x4 , x) = \u03a9(x4 , x) Ai (x4 , x)\u03a9\u2020 (x4 , x) + i\u03a9(x4 , x) \u2202i \u03a9\u2020 (x4 , x)\n\n(12)\n\nand introduces, instead of \u03a9(x4 , x), the new variable\nA4 (x4 , x) = i\u03a9(x4 , x) \u22024 \u03a9\u2020 (x4 , x).\n\n(13)\n\nFor example, if the interpolating gauge transformation is taken to be \u03a9(x4 , x) = exp{i x4 T \u03c9 a (x) ta },\nthen A4 is time-independent and equal to A4 (x) = T \u03c9 a (x) ta . We note that both A4 (x4 , x) and\nA\u2032i (x4 , x) are periodic in temporal direction.\nThe magnetic energy is gauge invariant, i.e.\nTr B 2 (Ai ) = Tr B 2 (A\u2032i ) ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhile the electric energy becomes\n2\n\nTr E 2 = Tr \u02262i = Tr E \u2032 ,\n\n(15)\n\nEi\u2032 = \u0226\u2032i \u2212 \u2202i A4 \u2212 i [A4 , A\u2032i ] = \u0226\u2032i \u2212 [\u2207i (A\u2032 )A4 ].\n\n(16)\n\nwhere\n\n5\n\n\f2\nTherefore the full action density can be rewritten as a standard Tr F\u03bc\u03bd\n, where\n\nF\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc \u2212 i [A\u03bc , A\u03bd ]\n\n(17)\n\nwith A\u03bc (x4 , x) denoting A\u2032i (x4 , x) and A4 (x4 , x). Thus, eq.

In\nthe limit T \u2192 \u221e all nonzero Matsubara modes become infinitely heavy. If one leaves only the\nstatic gluon modes it is called dimensional reduction [20], as the resulting theory is purely static.\nThere is no dynamics in the time direction anymore. At high, but not infinite temperatures, this\napproximation is too crude. The nonzero modes show up in loops and produce infinitely many\neffective vertices. The aim of this paper is to find all these infinite number of vertices restricted,\nhowever, to low momenta p < T , induced in the 1-loop order.\n\n3\n\nOne loop quantum action\n\nAs stressed in the Introduction, one can always choose the background field A4 to be static. As\nto the Ai field, we shall temporarily take it to be static: the generalization of the effective action\nto the case of timedependent Ai will be simple.\nTo study the effects of the nonzero Matsubara modes we use a background field method and\nsplit the gluon fields into a time independent background field \u0100\u03bc (x) and a presumably small\nquantum fluctuation field a\u03bc (x4 , x):\nA\u03bc (x4 , x) = \u0100\u03bc (x) + a\u03bc (x4 , x) .\n\n(20)\n\nIn this paper we consider the quantum effects at the 1-loop level. Then it is sufficient to expand\nthe action around the background field up to quadratic order in a\u03bc . The linear term in a\u03bc is absent\nowing to the orthogonality of nonstatic modes to static ones. We shall, however, also investigate\nthe contribution of the static fluctuation mode. In this case the linear term is absent if, e.g., the\nbackground field satisfies the equation of motion or if the static mode is varying in space faster\nthan the background field. The quadratic form is, generally speaking, degenerate so that one\nhas to fix the gauge for fluctuations. This gauge fixing is unrelated to the gauge fixing of the\nbackground field. We choose the background Lorenz gauge D\u03bc (\u0100)a\u03bc = 0 1 , where\nD\u03bcab (\u0100) = \u2202\u03bc \u03b4 ab + f acb \u0100c\u03bc .\n1\n\n(21)\n\nJackson and Okun [21] recommend to name the \u2202\u03bc A\u03bc = 0 gauge after the Dane Ludvig Lorenz and not after\nthe Dutchman Hendrik Lorentz who certainly used this gauge too but several decades later.\n\n6\n\n\fis the covariant derivative in the adjoint representation. This gauge brings in the Faddeev-Popov\nghost determinant which can be expressed as a Grassmann integral over ghost fields.

One can\nuse this freedom to make the A4 component static, which we shall always assume. The spatial\ncomponents Ai are then, generally speaking, time dependent. For the most of the paper we shall\nassume that Ai is time-independent too. At the end we shall be able to reconstruct terms with\n\u0226i from gauge invariance but at the time being we shall take static Ai . Then the quantum action\n(26) is invariant under time-independent gauge transformations,\n\u01004 (x) \u2192 U(x) \u01004 (x) U \u2020 (x),\n\u0100i (x) \u2192 U(x) \u0100i (x) U \u2020 (x) + i U(x) \u2202i U \u2020 (x) .\n\n(27)\n(28)\n\nIn this paper we restrict ourselves to the SU(2) color group, which means that the action depends\non the gauge and 3D Euclidean invariants Aa4 Aa4 , Eia Eia , Bia Bia , Eia Aa4 , Bia Aa4 , etc. For higher\ngroups there will be more invariants. We write the background fields without a bar from now on,\nas they are the only field variables left.\nIn fact the action can be presented as a series in the spatial covariant derivative Di . Since the\nelectric field is given by Eia = Diab Ab4 , an expansion in powers of the electric field corresponds to a\ncovariant gradient expansion of the A4 fields. To get the magnetic field, we already need one more\npower of Di , as Bka = 21 \u01ebijk Fija = 14 \u01ebijk \u01ebcad [Di , Dj ]cd . For the SU(2) gauge group, in the electric\n(magnetic) sector only two independent color vectors exist, Eia (Bia ) and Aa4 . Therefore, we expect\nthe following structure for the gauge-invariant gradient expansion:\nS1\u2212loop=\n\nZ\n\n\"\n\n#\n\nd3 x\n(Ei A4 )2\n(Bi A4 )2\n2\n\u2212T 4 V (\u03bd)+Ei2 f1 (\u03bd)+\nf\n(\u03bd)+B\nh\n(\u03bd)+\nh2 (\u03bd)+. . . .\n2\ni 1\nT\nA24\nA24\n\n(29)\n\nIn the explicit evaluation of the functional determinants we find exactly the structure eq. (29) and\ndetermine\u221a\nthe functions f1 , f2 , h1 , h2 at all values of their argument which is in fact a dimensionless\nratio \u03bd = Aa4 Aa4 /(2\u03c0T ).\n7\n\n\f4\n\nThe functional determinants\n\nWe start with the evaluation of the ghost functional determinant. As usual we subtract the zero\ngluon field contribution. Using the fact that det K = exp Tr log K we can write\ndet(\u2212D\u03bc2 )\n= exp Sp [log (\u2212D\u03bc2 ) \u2212 log (\u2212\u2202\u03bc2 )]\nexp log\n2\ndet(\u2212\u2202\u03bc )\n\n(30)\n\nwhere Sp is a functional trace. We present the ratio of determinants with the help of the Schwinger\nproper time representation [22]:\nlog det(\u2212D 2 )n \u2261 log\n\nZ \u221e\n\u0011\n\u0010\ndet(\u2212D\u03bc2 )\nds\n2\n2\nsD\u03bc\ns\u2202\u03bc\n.\n=\n\u2212\nSp\ne\n\u2212\ne\ndet(\u2212\u2202\u03bc2 )\ns\n0\n\n(31)\n\nIn fact this ratio is logarithmically UV divergent, reflecting the coupling constant renormalization.\nWe use the Pauli-Villars method to regularize the divergence. This corresponds to replacing the\ndeterminant by a 'quadrupole formula':\ndet(\u2212D 2 ) \u2212\u2192 det(\u2212D 2 )r,n\n(32)\n)\n( Z\n2\n2\n2\n\u0011i\n\u0011\u0010\nh\u0010\n\u221e ds\ndet(\u2212D\u03bc ) det(\u2212\u2202\u03bc + M )\n2\n2\nsD\u03bc\ns\u2202\u03bc\n\u2212sM 2\n.

(33) can be taken by inserting any full basis, so we are free to choose\ne.g. the plane-wave basis, exp(ix\u03b1 p\u03b1 ). Then, by the definition of the functional trace, one can\nwrite\nZ\nZ\nd4 p\nSp e\u2212sK = Tr\nd4 x lim\nexp(\u2212ip * y)exp(\u2212sK) exp(ip * x),\n(34)\ny\u2192x\n(2\u03c0)4\nwhere Tr is the remaining matrix trace over color and, as the case may be, Lorentz indices. One\ncan now drag the latter plane-wave exponent though the differential operator K until it cancels\nwith the former. This results in the shift of the derivatives inside the differential operator and in\nthe following representation of the functional trace [23]:\nSp e\u2212sK = Tr\n\nZ\n\nd4 x\n\nZ\n\nd4 p\nexp [\u2212sK(\u2202\u03b1 \u2192 \u2202\u03b1 + ip\u03b1 )] 1 .\n(2\u03c0)4\n\n(35)\n\nThe 1 at the end is meant to emphasize that the shifted operator acts on unity, so that for\nexample any term that has a \u2202\u03b1 in the exponent and is brought all the way to the right, will\nvanish.

For\nexample, to quadratic order in Di it corresponds to summing up all 1-loop Feynman diagrams\nwith two A4 vertices carrying momenta, and any number of A4 insertions at zero momentum. So\nfar, both eq. (40) and eq. (43) are independent of the gauge group.\n\n5\n\nZeroth order of covariant derivative expansion\n\nZeroth order in the expansion corresponds to setting Di = 0. For the gluon part (43) the field\nstrength does not contribute at this order since it is quadratic in the covariant derivatives. Hence\nthe gluonic contribution is \u2212(1/2) \u00d7 4 = \u22122 times the ghost contribution, where the factor (\u22121/2)\ncomes from the fact that the gluon determinant is taken to this power (see (25)), and the Lorentz\nstructure of the gluons, Tr \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd , yields 4. At zeroth order of the covariant derivative expansion one\nthus has:\n\u0011i(0)\nh\n\u0010\n(0)\nS1\u2212loop = \u2212 log det \u2212D 2\n.\n(44)\nThe determinant is UV finite in this order, so one does not need to regularize it.

In the invariant I2 we will\nhere only take the first term and leave away the anticommutator. Its effect will be shown later. In\nthe sum over the Matsubara frequencies we treat the zero mode separately [see Appendix B.2 for\ndetails]. For I1 and the first term in I2 the zero Matsubara frequency yields each an IR divergent\nterm i.e. proportional to lim\u03c9k \u21920 (1/\u03c9k ) and one finite term which is proportional to 1/\u03c6. The\n'naked' IR divergencies cancel between the two invariants I1,2 in such a way that both the ghost\nand the gluon contribution are separately IR finite. The zero mode of the invariant I3 contributes\nonly with a finite 1/\u03c6 term.\nWith our gauge choice Aa4 = \u03b4 a3 \u03c6 we actually get two structures, (Ei1 Ei1 + Ei2 Ei2 )f1 (\u03c6) and\n3 3\nEi Ei f3 (\u03c6), which can be written in invariant terms as\nEi2 f1 (\u03bd)\n\nand\n\n(Ei * A4 )2\n(f3 (\u03bd) \u2212 f1 (\u03bd)) ,\n|A4 |2\n\n(64)\n\nrespectively.

(29), i.e. terms quadratic in\nthe magnetic field. In analogy to the derivation of the action for the electric sector, we make an\nexpansion in the spatial covariant derivative Di of the functional determinants and collect powers\nof the magnetic field. Note that while the electric field only needed one power of a covariant\nderivative the magnetic field needs two. For magnetic field squared we hence need an expansion\nto fourth order in the covariant derivatives. In principle, in the fourth order in the covariant\nderivatives there is a mixed term of the type \u01ebijk \u01ebabc Eia Ejb Bkc f (A4 ), terms quartic in Ei and terms\ncontaining covariant derivatives of Ei but we do not consider them here. For that reason, we\nneglect all commutators [Di , A4 ], as they introduce additional powers of Ei . This simply means\nthat we can drag all powers of the covariant derivative Di as well as of the field strengths Fij\nthrough the exponentials of A4 , as if they commute 2 .\n2\n\nOne obtains from the Jacobi identity [Fij , A4 ] = i ([Di , Ej ] \u2212 [Dj , Ei ]). Since we are not interested now in such\nterms in the effective action, we shall assume that the magnetic field commutes with A4 .\n\n14\n\n\fFor the ghost determinant (55) we obtain [see Appendix C.1] only one gauge invariant structure,\nwhich after integration over p becomes\nh\n\n2\n\nlog det(\u2212D )r,n\n\ni(2)\nM\n\n1\n=\n48 \u03c0 3/2\n\nZ\n\n\u221e Z\nX\n\n3\n\ndx\n\nk=\u2212\u221e 0\n\n\u221e\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\nds\n2\n2\n\u221a Tr 1 \u2212 e\u2212sM\nesA Bk Bk .\ns\n\n(84)\n\nFor the gluon determinant (57) we get the same result times a factor of \u22122 plus one additional\nterm:\nZ 1\nZ 1\u2212\u03b1\n2\n2\n2\nT4 \u2261 Tr\nd\u03b1\nd\u03b2 e\u03b1sA (2s\u01ebacb Fijc ) e\u03b2sA (2s\u01ebdf e Fijf ) e(1\u2212\u03b1\u2212\u03b2)sA ,\n(85)\n\nwhich with\nstructure:\n\nFija Fijb\n\n0\n2Bka Bkb\n\n=\n\n0\n\nand after integration over \u03b1 and \u03b2 yields the same gauge invariant\n\u0010\n\n2\n\nT4 = 4 s2Tr esA Bk Bk\n\n\u0011\n\n.\n\n(86)\n\nWe find [see Appendix C.1] that this term yields the same contribution to the action as the ghost\ndeterminant, but multiplied by a factor of 12.

In the first one [25] gluon by gluon scattering at low momenta in the nonzero temperature Yang-Mills theory is calculated in terms of Feynman diagrams. In the second one [13] an\neffective theory for the static modes of SU(N) Yang\u2013Mills theory in terms of a covariant derivative expansion is derived. The author makes a series expansion of the functional determinants,\nand goes up to six orders in the covariant derivative. This corresponds to a 1-loop calculation\n16\n\n\fwith up to six external static gluons and their effective vertices. The zero Matsubara frequency\ncontribution is not included.\nTo compare our results to those of Refs.[25] and [13] we need to expand our functions f1,2 , h1,2\nin powers of A4 . We would like to stress that within our calculation we can go to arbitrary power\nof A4 , while Refs. [25] and [13] only go to the quadratic order. For a comparison we look at the\nquadratic terms in A4 and obtain the following contribution:\nZ\n\nd3 x\n\n\u0011\n\u03b6(3) 11 \u0010 2 2\n2\n.\nE\nA\n+\n3(EA\n)\n4\n4\n\u03c0 4 T 3 384\n\n(100)\n\nThis agrees precisely with Ref. [13] after collecting terms of the orders above. Ref.[25] differs both\nin sign and magnitude. For the magnetic part we can only compare to Ref. [13], as only there the\nterms under consideration have been computed. To quadratic order in A4 we obtain\nZ\n\nd3 x\n\n\u0011\n\u03b6(3) 11 \u0010 2 2\n2\n,\nB\nA\n+\n(BA\n)\n4\n4\n\u03c0 4 T 3 192\n\n(101)\n\nwhich again coincides exactly with the result derived in Ref. [13]. In addition, in Ref. [14] the\n1-loop action for the Polyakov line has been computed up to two derivatives in the specific case\nof zero Ai . Although it may look as being a gauge-noninvariant condition, in fact one of the\ngauge-invariant structures can be extracted from that calculation. Indeed, the gauge-invariant\ncombination (Ei A4 )2 /A24 projects out the Ai field. Therefore, what we call the f3 function has\nbeen actually computed in that paper, and our result coincides with theirs.\n\n10\n\nTime dependence and periodicity in A4\n\nSo far we have considered only time-independent background fields A4 and Ai . As stressed in the\nIntroduction, taking A4 static is no restriction on the background but merely a convenient gauge\nchoice. However, taking Ai static is a restriction, and we would like to relax it, that is to include\nterms in the effective action containing time derivatives \u0226i . To the second order in \u0226i , this can\nbe done in a very simple way. Namely, we notice that in deriving the quantum action we have\nmade use of the commutators (52,53) which remain exactly the same if we replace A4 in A by\nthe more general operator D4 . The only difference is that the resulting electric field should be\nnow understood as the full Eia = Diab Ab4 \u2212 \u0226ai . With this replacement, one gets the same effective\naction (3) as in the case of a purely static Ai . As in the static case, it is limited to the second\npower of Ei and hence of \u0226i . Therefore, its applicability is restricted by the condition that both\nspatial and time derivatives of the fields are much less than the temperature.\nAfter fixing the gauge such that A4 is static one can perform further a time-independent gauge\nrotation to make A4 (x) diagonal i.e. belonging to the Cartan subalgebra at all spatial points.\nWe shall use this gauge condition in this section to simplify the discussion. For the SU(2) gauge\n3\ngroup it means that we take A4 = \u03c6 \u03c42 .\nHaving fixed the gauge such that A4 is static and diagonal there is only an Abelian residual\ngauge symmetry left. It consists of arbitrary time-independent gauge rotations about the Cartan\ngenerators, and of a timedependent gauge rotation (also about the Cartan axes) of a special\ndiscrete type compatible with periodicity of Ai (x, t). For the SU(2) gauge group this residual\n\n17\n\n\fgauge symmetry is with respect to the Abelian gauge transformation\n\u2020\n\n(\n\n)\n\n\u03c43\nS(x, t) = exp \u2212i [\u03b1(x) + 2\u03c0tT n] ,\n2\n\n\u2020\n\nA\u03bc \u2192 S A\u03bc S + iS \u2202\u03bc S,\n\n(102)\n\nwhere n is an integer, which follows from the requirement that Ai (x, t) remains periodic in time.\nOne cannot take rotations about axes other than the 3d one because it will make A4 nondiagonal, and one cannot take the time dependence other than linear because that would make A4\ntimedependent. In components, the transformation (102) reads:\nA\u203243 (x)\nA\u2032i 1 (x, t)\nA\u2032i 2 (x, t)\nA\u2032i 3 (x, t)\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nA34 (x) + 2\u03c0T n,\nmeaning \u03bd \u2032 = \u03bd + n,\ncos\u03b2A1i + sin\u03b2A2i ,\n\u03b2(x, t) = \u03b1(x) + 2\u03c0T nt,\n1\n2\n\u2212sin\u03b2Ai + cos\u03b2Ai ,\nA3i + \u2202i \u03b1(x).\n\n(103)\n(104)\n(105)\n(106)\n\nThe effective action must be invariant under this transformation, but is it?\nIt is easy to check that the combinations of the field strengths Bi3 Bi3 , Bi\u22a5 Bi\u22a5 , Ei3 Ei3 and\nEi\u22a5 Ei\u22a5 (where F \u22a5 F \u22a5 is the short-hand notation for F 1 F 1 + F 2 F 2 ) are invariant under the gauge\ntransformation (103-106). As follows from eq. (3) these structures are multiplied by the functions\nH3 (\u03bd), H1 (\u03bd), F3 (\u03bd) and F1 (\u03bd), respectively. Therefore to support the invariance of the effective\naction under the gauge transformation (102), all the four functions need to be periodic in \u03bd =\nA34 /2\u03c0T with unit period.\nSo far we have computed those functions in the domain 0 < \u03bd < 1, so to check the periodicity\none has to know them outside this domain. Actually only the last step, namely the summation\nover Matsubara frequencies, has to be revisited. The result is as follows: The static potential\nV (\u03bd) and the functions H1 (\u03bd), H3 (\u03bd) and F3 (\u03bd) are, indeed, periodic (and even) in \u03bd, whereas the\nlast function F1 (\u03bd) is even but not periodic.\nIndeed, for 0 < |\u03bd| < 1 we find:\n\"\n\n\u0012 \u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n11\n\u03bd\n20\n\u03bd\nF1 (\u03bd) = \u2212\n+\n\u03c8\n\u2212\n\u2212\nL\n+\n\u03c8\n48\u03c0 2\n2\n2\n11|\u03bd|\n\n#\n\n.\n\n(107)\n\nFor 1 < |\u03bd| < 2 we find:\n\"\n\n\u0012 \u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n11\n\u03bd\n38\n8\n\u03bd\nF1 (\u03bd) = \u2212\n+\n\u03c8\n\u2212\n\u2212\n2\n\u2212\nL\n+\n\u03c8\n\u2212\n48\u03c0 2\n2\n2\n11\u03bd 11\n\n1\n1\n\u2212\n\u03bd 2 |\u03bd 3 |\n\n!#\n\n.\n\n(108)\n\nFor 2 < |\u03bd| < 3 we find:\n\"\n\n\u0012 \u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n#\n\n\u0013\n\n11\n\u03bd\n56\n24\n40\n2\n2\n\u03bd\nF1 (\u03bd) = \u2212\n+\n\u03c8\n\u2212\n\u2212\n3\n\u2212\n,\nL\n+\n\u03c8\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n+\n48\u03c0 2\n2\n2\n11|\u03bd| 11\u03bd 2 11|\u03bd 3 | 2 \u2212 |\u03bd| 4 \u2212 |\u03bd|\n(109)\netc. By L we have denoted the constant part: L = \u22122log(\u039b/4\u03c0T ).This function is plotted in Fig.\n2 and is clearly not periodic.\nThe reason of this periodicity paradox is clear.

Therei\nfore, the corresponding functions H1 (\u03bd), H3 (\u03bd) and F3 (\u03bd) should be periodic to support gauge\ninvariance, which indeed they are. One cannot and should not observe gauge invariance in the\nstructure Ei\u22a5 Ei\u22a5 F1 (\u03bd) as it is only a quadratic functional in \u0226i1,2 , which is insufficient. There is\nno periodicity requirement on F1 (\u03bd). All powers of \u02261,2\ni /T (and of A4 /T ) need to be collected in\nthe effective action to check the invariance under fast timedependent gauge transformations (102).\nThis, however, lies beyond the scope of the present study.\n\n11\n\nConclusions\n\nGiven that the Polyakov line in the A4 static gauge is\n!\n\nA4 (x)\n,\n(110)\nP (x) = exp i\nT\n\u221a\nits gauge-invariant eigenvalues are e\u00b1i\u03c0\u03bd where \u03bd = Aa4 Aa4 /2\u03c0T . We have in fact computed\nthe 1-loop effective action for the eigenvalues of the Polyakov line, interacting with the spatial\ncomponents of the Yang\u2013Mills field Ai . For the SU(2) gauge group the effective action is given\nby eq. (3) with the four functions F1,2 (\u03bd) and H1,2 (\u03bd) defined in eqs.(74, 75) and eqs.(93, 94),\nrespectively. All functions are singular and behave as 1/A4 at small A4 , which is due to the\ncontribution of the zero Matsubara frequency. It should be stressed that the functions H1,2 (\u03bd)\nbeing coefficients in front of the invariants quadratic in the magnetic field, contain 'naked' IR\ndivergences which are regularized by higher orders of the magnetic field and/or field momentum.\nIf the static fluctuation mode is excluded from the effective action, all functions become finite and\nnonsingular; they are then given by eqs.(77, 78) and eqs.(97, 98), respectively. If the background\nfield does not satisfy the Yang\u2013Mills equations of motion, there is an additional term (82).\nAs it should be expected, the functions H1,2 (\u03bd), F3 (\u03bd) = F1 (\u03bd) + F2 (\u03bd) and the static potential\nV (\u03bd) are periodic functions of \u03bd but F1 (\u03bd) is not. The periodicity is related to the gauge invariance\nof the effective action with respect to fast timedependent gauge transformations inducing large\nelectric field \u0226i . For the particular structure related to F1 (\u03bd), this gauge invariance can only be\nrevealed when all powers of the electric field in the effective action are collected.\nFor higher gauge groups there will be more invariant structures already in the quadratic order\nin the electric and magnetic fields, and the coefficient functions will depend on all the eigenvalues\n19\n\n\fof the Polyakov line, whose number is N \u2212 1 for the SU(N) gauge group. It is worthwhile to\ngeneralize this work to higher groups, as well as to find the 1-loop affective action arising from\nintegrating out fermions.\nOne can think of two kinds of applications of our results. One is for studying correlation functions, say, of the Polyakov lines at high temperatures but going beyond the approximations used\npreviously. One might be also interested in evaluating the 1-loop weights of extended semiclassical\nobjects, such as calorons with nontrivial holonomy and dyons. The technique developed in this\npaper is applicable for such studies.\nAcknowledgments:\nWe are grateful to Rob Pisarski for valuable discussions and to Eric Braaten for reading the\nmanuscript and helpful comments.
