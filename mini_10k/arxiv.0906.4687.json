There\nare many fields where spheroidal functions play important roles just as the spherical functions\ndo. So far, in comparison to simpler spherical special functions (the associated Lengdre's\nfunctions ) their properties still are difficult for study than their counterpart[1]-[3].\nTheir differential equations are\n\"\n\n#\n\nd\nd\nm2\n\u0398 = 0x \u2208 (\u22121, +1).\n(1 \u2212 x2 )\n+ E + \u03b1x2 \u2212\ndx\ndx\n1 \u2212 x2\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(1)\n\nThey only have one more term \u03b1X 2 than the spherical ones (the associated Lendgre's equations).\nThis is a kind of the Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem with the natural conditions\nthat \u0398 is finite at the boundaries x = \u00b11. The parameter E can only takes the values\nE0 , E1 , . . . , En , . . ., which are called the eigenvalues of the problem, and the corresponding\nsolutions (the eigenfunctions) \u03980 , \u03981 , . . . , \u0398n , . . . are called the spheroidal wave functions\n[1]-[3].\n\u2217\n\nE-mail: tgh-2000@263.net, tgh20080827@gmail.com, shuqzhong@gmail.com\n\n1\n\n\fUnder the condition \u03b1 = 0, they reduce to the Spherical equation and the solutions\nto the Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem are the associated Legendre-functions Pnm (x)(the\nspherical functions) with the eigenvalues En = n(n + 1), n = m + 1, m + 2, . . .. Though the\nspheroidal wave equations are extension of the ordinary spherical wave functions equations,\nthe difference between this two kinds of wave funtions are far greater than their similarity[1].\n1. The spherical wave functions Pnm (x) have many good property such as\n(a) the Legendre-functions Pn (x) = Pn0 (x) are polynomials;\n(b) Back to the variable \u03b8 with x = cos \u03b8, the recursion relation among the Legendrefunctions could be written as:\nd\nPn (cos \u03b8) \u221d \u2212n cos \u03b8 \u2212 sin \u03b8\nPn\u22121 (cos \u03b8), n = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,\nd\u03b8\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(2)\n\nso, all Pn (cos \u03b8) could be deduced from the first or ground function P0 from the\nrecursion relation\nm by\n(c) all the associated Legendre-functions Pnm (cos \u03b8) could be derived from Pm\n\n\u0014\n\nPnm (cos \u03b8) = \u2212n cos \u03b8 \u2212 sin \u03b8\n\nd\nP m (cos \u03b8), n = m + 1, m + 2, m + 3, . . . , .

On the contrary, very little are known about the properties of the spheroidal wave\nfunctions:\n(a) All spheroidal wave functions can not be polynomials at all.\n(b) Whether or not there are the similar recurrence relations between them is not\nclear, at least they have not been found upon to now.\nThe recursion relations of the spherical wave functions, the associated Legendre functions reflect the the factorization properties of the Legendre equations[16]. This shows that\nthe Legendre equations are solvable. The Super-symmetry quantum mechanics tells that the\nroots of the solvable properties of differential equations are the super-invariance of their superpotential. In this paper, we testily investigate whether the spheroidal differential equations\nhave the similar shape-invariance property. On accounting of the fact that their differential\nequations are difficult to treat, we only can rely on the approximate method of small parameter \u03b1. The results may make one happy: they have shape-invariance property upon to the\nfirst term approximation.\n\n2\n\nBrief review of the theory of SUSY in solving eigenvalueproblem\n\nIn recent years, supersymmetric quantum mechanics have attracted tremendous attention\nfor solvable potential problems. They not only provide clear insight into the factorization\nmethod of Infeld and Hull [16], but also make great improvement in solving the differential\nequations. See reference [14] for review on its development.\n\n2\n\n\fIn supersymmetric quantum mechanics [14]-[15], the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is\nH \u2212 \u03c8\u2212 = \u2212\n\nd2 \u03c8 \u2212\n+ V \u2212 (x)\u03c8 \u2212 (x) = E\u2212 \u03c8 \u2212\ndx2\n\n(4)\n\nwith h\u0304 = 2m = 1. Here one considers the case of unbroken supersymmetry which demands\nthat the ground state is nodeless with zero energy, and supposes that the superpotential\nW (x) is continuous and differentiable. The super-potential W (x) satisfies the equation\nV \u2212 (x) = W 2 (x) \u2212 W \u2032 (x).\n\n(5)\n\nWith the introducing the two operators\nA=\n\nd\nd\n+ W (x) , A\u2020 = \u2212\n+ W (x),\ndx\ndx\n\n(6)\n\nthe corresponding Hamiltonian H \u2212 have a factorized form\nH \u2212 = A\u2020 A .\n\n(7)\n\nThe partner potential V + (x) of V \u2212 is determined by the superpotential W (x) as\nV + (x) = W 2 (x) + W \u2032 (x),\n\n(8)\n\nand the corresponding Hamiltonian H +\nH + \u03c8+ = \u2212\n\nd2 \u03c8 +\n+ V \u2212 (x)\u03c8 + (x) = E+ \u03c8 +\ndx2\n\n(9)\n\nhas a factorized form\nH + = AA\u2020 .\n\n(10)\n\nThe Hamiltonians H + and H \u2212 have exactly the same eigenvalues (or the same spectrum)\nexcept that H \u2212 has an additional zero energy and the related eigenstate, that is,\n(\u2212)\n\nE0\n\n=0,\n\n(+)\n\nEn\u22121 = En(\u2212) ,\n\n(+)\n\n\u03c8n\u22121 \u221d A \u03c8n(\u2212) ,\n\n(\u2212)\n\nA\u2020 \u03c8n(+) \u221d \u03c8n+1 ,\n\nn = 1, 2, . . . .\n\n(11)\n\nThe pair of SUSY partner potentials V \u00b1 (x) are called shape invariant if they are similar in\nshape and differ only in the parameters, that is\nV + (x; a1 ) = V \u2212 (x; a2 ) + R(a1 ),\n\n(12)\n\nwhere a1 is a set of parameters, a2 is a function of a1 (say a2 = f (a1 )) and the remainder\nR(a1 ) is independent of x. One can use the property of shape invariance to obtain the analytic determination of energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions [14]-[15]. Thus for an unbroken\nsupersymmetry, the eigenstates of the potential V \u2212 (x) are:\nE0\u2212\n\n= 0,\n\nEn\u2212\n\n=\n\nn\nX\n\nR(ak )\n\n(13)\n\nk=1\n\n\u0014\n\n\u03a80 \u221d exp \u2212\n\nZ\n\nx\n\nx0\n\nW (y, a1 )dy\n\n\u0015\n\n\u2212\n\u2020\n\u03a8\u2212\nn = A (x, a1 )\u03a8n\u22121 (x, a2 ), n = 1, 2, 3, . . .\n\nTherefore, the shape invariance condition actually is an integrability condition.\n3\n\n(14)\n(15)\n\n\f3\n\nthe eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the excited states in\nfirst order\n\nIn the following, we rewrite the equations (1) in the Schr\u00f6dinger form. Though the form (1)\nis more familiar for research, the problem is easier to solve in the original differential equation\nthan in the equation (1).

Subtracting\nE0 to make it possible to factorize eqns.(19). Actually, it is difficult to find the solutions of\nthe equation (22). So the perturbation methods come naturally, which have been detailed in\nthe reference [18] where the perturbation method in supersymmetry quantum has been used\nto resolve the ground state function of the spheroidal equations in approximation of little\nparameter \u03b1. Here is brief accounting of the results. One just expands the super-potential\nW , the central concept of supersymmetry quantum, in the series form of the parameter \u03b1.\nBecause the potential is already in the series of \u03b1, one could solve the series forms of the\nsuper-potential W by solving term by term. Also note the fact the ground energy E0 must\nbe in the series form of the parameter \u03b1 and could be obtained by the boundary conditions.\nSo, the super-potential W and E0 could be expanded as series of the parameter \u03b1, that is,\nW = W0 + \u03b1W1 + \u03b12 W2 + \u03b13 W3 + . . . .\n4\n\n(23)\n\n\fE0 =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nE0n \u03b1n\n\n(24)\n\nn=0\n\nThe perturbation equation becomes\nW 2 \u2212 W \u2032 = V (\u03b8, \u03b1, m) \u2212\n\n\u221e\nX\n1 m2 \u2212 14\n2\n\u2212\n\u03b1\ncos\n\u03b8\n\u2212\nE0n \u03b1n\nE0n \u03b1n = \u2212 +\n2\n4\nsin\n\u03b8\nn=0\nn=0\n\u221e\nX\n\n(25)\n\nThere are two lower indices in the parameter E0n with the index 0 refereing to the ground\nP\nn\nstate and the other index n meaning the nth term in parameter \u03b1.

The results are much more like case of the associated-Lengdre functions.\nThey are new and interesting. The method can also be used to solve higher order terms of\nthe super-potential and the related super-invariance problem of the spin-weighted spheroidal\nfunctions. The methods apply to the spin-weighted spheroidal functions for the case s 6= 0.\nThese cases have been studied too and will be reported.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe greatly appreciate the hospitality of the Gravitation Theory group and the MCFP in\nUMD .
