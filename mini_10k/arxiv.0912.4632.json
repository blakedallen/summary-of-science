One of particularly interesting questions is related to the thermoelectric properties of Quantum Dots (QD) in a Coulomb Blockade\n(CB) regime. While the experimental behavior of thermoelectric transport through weakly coupled QD-devices\nis well described theoretically [5, 6], the regime of strong\ncoupling of the QD to the reservoirs is far from being\nunderstood.\nThe strong enhancement of thermopower is important\nfor nano-technology applications [4]. It provides a challenge for both experimental fabrication of devices with\nhigh thermo-conductance and theoretical suggestions for\nefficient mechanisms of a heat transfer. On one hand,\nthe nano-technologies offer fascinating tunability of single electron transport, while most parameters can be\nchanged continuously by applying gate voltage, external electric and magnetic fields etc. On the other hand,\nthe nano-devices efficiently operate in strong coupling\nregime where effects of strong electron correlations can\nbe viewed as a prominent mechanism for the thermoelectric coefficients enhancement. In particular, the Kondo\neffect is known as a tool for strong intensification of electric transport through single electron transistor (SET).\nMoreover, by increasing the number of channels one can\nfine tune SET to a Non-Fermi liquid (NFL) regime. The\nNFL behavior is however illusive being very sensitive to\nvariation of external parameters since channel symmetry is generally unprotected by conservation laws. Thus,\nby perturbing the SET with external fields one creates\na mechanism of restoration of Fermi-liquid (FL) transport. These effects are known in the theory of electric\ntransport [9]. In this Letter we present a theory of an\ninterplay between NFL and FL strong coupling regimes\nin thermoelectric transport through the nano-structures.\nTypical experimental setup [3] for measuring the thermopower S=\u2212\u2206Vth /\u2206T is shown on Fig.1. The measurement of thermo-voltage \u2206Vth provides independent\n\ninformation on the thermo-conductance GT . The temperature difference across the dot \u2206T is controlled by using a current heating technique. The differential conductance G is measured at variable gate voltages Vg . Similar\nto differential conductance, the thermopower S=GT /G\nshows the oscillations as a function of Vg . However,\nthese oscillations are not sinusoidal at the strong coupling\nregime. Moreover, no relation analogous to Cutler-Mott\nformula [10] S\u223c\u2202ln G/\u2202Vg exists in that limit underlining\nimportance of strong electron correlations.\nTheory of thermopower (TP) of a CB - quantum dot\nhas been studied in [5] using a linear response theory\nin both classical and quantum regimes and verified by\nexperiment [1, 2]. For a week coupling of the dot to\nreservoirs, there is no deviation from the theory ignoring\neffects of interaction. By increasing the coupling of the\nSET to one (or both) reservoirs one reaches the strong\ncoupling regime where Kondo physics becomes important for odd electron occupation number in the dot. The\nthermoelectric transport through the SET in the Kondo\nregime has been studied numerically in [8].\nAnother approach to describe SET in the strong coupling regime has been proposed in [12, 13, 14]. The theory of the TP of the SET designed as the quantum dot\nstrongly coupled to one of the leads through almost transparent Quantum Point Contact (QPC) [15] and weakly\ncoupled to second reservoir has been constructed by Andreev and Matveev (AM) in [6]. In the model [6] the dot\nwas assumed large enough to disregard the effects of finite\nmean-level spacing \u03b4 [16]. There is no odd-even effects\nrelated to the occupation of the dot since the QD+QPC\nmimics a \u03c3=1/2 quantum impurity. The transport of\nelectrons is dominated by the inelastic cotunneling at\ntemperatures T \u226aEC . The two limits were considered\nin [6]: i) the electron spins are fully polarized by strong\nexternal magnetic field B [17] and ii) the electrons spins\nare unpolarized, B=0. In the first limit, corresponding\nto single channel Kondo (1CK) physics, the TP shows\nsinusoidal oscillations as a function of the gate voltage\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Experimental setup of SET in the\nstrong coupling regime (see text for the details). The arrow\nalong left lead stands for the electric current controlling the\nJoule heat.

In particular, effects of Zeeman\nsmearing of Coulomb staircase steps due to magnetic field\ndriven asymmetry of reflection amplitudes was studied\nin [24] for the almost open QD capacitively coupled to\nthe gate. Thus, as it was shown in [24], magnetic field\nproduces relevant perturbation for AM model. Unstable nature of 2CK strong coupling fixed point makes it\nvery tricky to observe the fingerprints of NFL in electron\ntransport through nanostructures [9]. We show in this\nLetter that the proximity to NFL regime can be seen in\nthe thermoelectric transport tuned by external magnetic\nfield and address the question how the thermoelectric coefficients evolve in the presence of finite magnetic field.\nThe Hamiltonian describing the quantum dot coupled\nweakly to the left contact and strongly to the right contact (Fig.1) has the form H=H0 +HL +HR +HC , where\nX\nX\nH0 =\n\u01ebk,\u03b1 c\u2020k,\u03b1 ck,\u03b1 +\n\u01ebp,\u03b1 d\u2020p,\u03b1 dp,\u03b1\nk,\u03b1\n\n(1)\n\nHere N (Vg ) is a dimensionless parameter which is proportional to Vg . The TP is a linear function of both reflection amplitude |r| and temperature. We refer to the\nlinear-T dependence of TP as the FL regime. However,\nin contrast to TP in bulk metals S \u223c T /\u01ebF , the energy in\ndenominator (1) is much smaller [18] compared to Fermi\nenergy \u01ebF (cf. [19]) thus enhancing the TP.\nThere are two important regimes for thermoelectric coefficients in the limit of unpolarized electrons. First, at\ntemperatures EC |r|2 \u226a T \u226a EC the TP oscillations are\nsinusoidal and quadratic in the reflection amplitude |r|:\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\nEC\nS \u223c |r|2 ln\nsin(2\u03c0N (Vg )).\n(2)\ne\nT\nSecond, at smaller temperatures T \u226a EC |r|2 , the TP\noscillations are non-sinusoidal\n\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0014\n1 2\n\u0393(Vg )\nEC\nS \u223c |r| ln\nsin(2\u03c0N (Vg ))f\n, (3)\ne\nT + \u0393(Vg )\nT\nwhere \u0393(Vg ) \u223c EC |r|2 cos2 (\u03c0N (Vg )) and f (x) is defined p\nin [20]. The amplitude of S scales as Smax \u223c\ne\u22121 |r| T /EC ln(EC /T ). Thus, the TP is strongly enhanced by the electron's\ncorrelations in the strong cou\u221a\npling regime. The T ln T scaling of S - maximums is\nrelated to the nodes of \u0393 at the Coulomb peaks. The\n\"effective width\" \u0393 cuts the\u221alog in (2) everywhere away\nfrom the peaks. We refer to T ln T behavior of Smax as\nthe NFL regime. Such scaling of the TP at T \u226aEC is attributed to the two-channel Kondo effect (2CK) [21, 22]\nwhere the channels \u2191 and \u2193 scatter on \u03c3=1/2 isospin\nassociated with left- and right- movers passing through\nthe QD+QPC [23]. However, as it is known [21], the\n2CK strong coupling fixed point is unstable.

The detailed calculations will be\npublished elsewhere [26]. New effects reported in present\nLetter and missing in AM theory appear due to asymmetry of the point contact reflection amplitudes (Fig.2,\nInsert 2) in a presence of Zeeman splitting (cf. [24]).\nThis asymmetry, in turn, leads to the asymmetry of the\nchannels in 2CK. Besides, the magnetic field lifts out the\nspin-charge separation characteristic for the unpolarized\nmodels [27]. Since the system possesses the particle-hole\nsymmetry at a perfect transmission, the leading effects\ndetermining behavior of the thermoelectric coefficients\nappear only at non-zero backward scattering. This is why\nthe major effect is related to asymmetry of |r|'s. Thus, we\nare allowed to disregard the effects of the Fermi-velocities\ndifference in a full agreement with standard bosonization\n\nFIG. 3: Left and central panels: TP as a function of the gate\nvoltage at different magnetic fields. The curves are obtained\nnumerically for T /EC =0.1 (left panel) and T /EC =0.001 (central panel). For both cases |r0 |2 = 0.1. The insert on the left\npanel shows the magnetic field dependence for the down (solid\nline) and up (dashed line) reflection amplitudes. The insert\non the central panel shows the gate voltage dependence of\n\u0393. Right panel: maximum of TP in a Coulomb window at\nvarious fixed temperatures as the function of magnetic field.\n\nscheme [27]. The effects of spectrum curvature responsible for particle-hole asymmetry are crucial for understanding of Coulomb drag effect in the Luttinger Liquids\n[28]. The finite curvature effects, however result in subleading corrections to TP for the AM model while leading effect comes from the scattering potential asymmetry.\nMoreover, the saturation of |r\u2193 |\u21921 occurs at magnetic\nfields B \u2217 \u226aBC (see left insert on Fig.3), BC is defined\nas a field corresponding to full polarization of the QPC.\nThe channel \u2193 becomes completely reflecting and therefore does not contribute to the transport. It explains the\ncrossover from \u223c|r|2 for small B (2) to \u223c|r| for B>B \u2217\n(1) in TP.\nIn a spirit of AM theory [6] we first calculate the leading non-trivial correction to the thermo-conductance GT\nand the thermopower S for the case of slightly asymmetric reflection amplitudes. The equation (2) is modified by\na replacement |r|2 \u2192 |r\u2191 r\u2193 |. Thus, all perturbative corrections depend on a symmetric s = |r\u2191 |+|r\u2193 | \u2248 2|r0 | and\nanti-symmetric a = ||r\u2193 |\u2212|r\u2191 || \u223c |r0 B/BC | combinations\nof the reflection amplitudes. Here |r0 | stands for the reflection amplitude at B=0. Proceeding with the higherorder perturbative corrections to thermo-conductance\nand TP we notice existence of a new energy scale (similar\nto \u0393 in (3)) depending on external magnetic field [26].\nMore efficient way to prove emergence of new energy\nscale is to map the model (4-7) onto effective Anderson model [12]. This mapping, being non-perturbative in\ns and a accounts for nontrivial low-frequency dynamics\nof the spin modes. The channel asymmetry a leads to\nnontrivial contribution to the Kondo resonance \u0393 in the\n\n\f4\nvicinity of Coulomb peaks\n\u0393=\n\n\u0003\n2\u03b3EC \u0002 2\ns cos2 (\u03c0N ) + a2 sin2 (\u03c0N ) .\n2\n\u03c0\n\n(11)\n\nAs it is shown in the central insert of Fig. 3, \u0393 is gapped\nat the Coulomb peaks with the gap Tmin =\u0393min \u223ca2 EC\ndepending on the magnetic field through a. As a result,\nthe thermal and electric conductances acquire a form\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0001 T\n\u0393\nEC\n1 GL 2\nln\ns \u2212 a2\nsin(2\u03c0N )F1\nGT = \u2212\n12\u03c0 e\nEC\nT +\u0393\nT\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0393\nGL T\n.\n(12)\nF2\nG=\n4\u03b3EC\nT\nThe functions F1 (x) and F2 (x) are defined in [20],\n\u03b3\u22481.78. The equations (12) allow regular expansion at\nT \u226aTmin . In the Coulomb valleys the AM results are\nreproduced. The effects of magnetic field in the valley regime manifest themselves in reducing the TP and\nrestoration of the sinusoidal shape of the TP curve. In\nthe vicinity of Coulomb peaks and at sufficiently low temperatures T \u226aTmin the equations (12) cast the form\n\u0001 T3\n2\u03c0 3 GL 2\nEC\nGT = \u2212\ns \u2212 a2\nln\nsin(2\u03c0N ) ,\n15 e\nEC \u03932a\n\u0393a\n\u03c0 2 GL T 2\nG=\n,\n(13)\n6\u03b3 EC \u0393a\n\u0015\n\u0014\n4\u03c0\u03b3 T 2\nEC\nS=\u2212\nsin (2\u03c0N ) ,\n(s \u2212 a2 ) ln\n5e \u0393a\n\u0393a\n2\nC 2\nwhere \u0393a = 2\u03b3E\n\u03c0 2 a sin (\u03c0N ). Thus, the re-scaled FL\nregime is restored at low temperatures T \u226a\u0393a (N \u21921/2).\nThe equations (11-13) represent the central result of\nthis Letter. The new energy scale Tmin strongly depends\non magnetic field and manifests itself by opening a gap at\nthe Coulomb peaks. Appearance of this scale [24] leads\nto the restoration of the FL thermo- and electric- transport properties. However, proximity to NFL regime at\nB\u226aBC results in strong enhancement of the TP. When\nthe channel \u2193 becomes fully reflecting, the equation (13)\nreduces to 1CK result (1). The curves on right panel\nof Fig.3 are obtained as numerical solution of (12) and\nshow the evolution of TP amplitude in the interval of\ngate voltages N , N +1 at fixed temperatures as a function of magnetic field. The behavior of TP at temperatures T >Tmax \u223cs2 EC is trivial and described by Eq.2.\nThe crossover from NFL to FL is seen at the intermediate\nrange of temperatures Tmin <T <Tmax. Thus, the magnetic field stabilizes the FL thermoelectric properties.\nWe conclude that the external magnetic field applied\nto the SET in the strong coupling regime is responsible for the NFL-to-FL change of transport properties\nand provides efficient mechanism for the restoration of\nthe FL behavior in the thermoelectric transport. The\napplied to SET parallel magnetic field B results in the\nchannel up/down asymmetry and thus changes the universality class from two-channel Kondo to single-channel\n\nKondo regimes. Another possibility of the 2CK suppression is associated with a finite source-drain voltage or\nnoise, which is equivalent to the Zeeman effect for the\nconventional Kondo systems. We also expect restoration\nof the FL transport for the out-of-equilibrium SETs.\nWe are grateful to K.A.
