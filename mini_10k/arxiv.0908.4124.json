The extremely complicated\nhadron collider environment does not only require sufficiently precise predictions for newphysics signals, but also for many complicated background reactions that cannot entirely be\nmeasured from data. Among such background processes, several involve three, four, or even\nmore particles in the final state, rendering the necessary next-to-leading-order (NLO) calculations in QCD very complicated. This problem lead to the creation of an \"experimenters' wishlist\nfor NLO calculations\" [1\u20133] that were still missing at that time, but are required for successful\nLHC analyses. The process pp \u2192 W+ W\u2212 +jet + X made it to the top of this list. Meanwhile\nthe 2 \u2192 3 particle processes on the list have been evaluated at NLO QCD, and we further contribute to and extend that part in this paper; most notably also some of the 2 \u2192 4 processes\nhave been calculated to NLO recently, viz. for the production of tt\u0304bb\u0304 [4] and W + 3jets final\nstates [5]. Moreover, benchmark results for the virtual corrections have been presented for a\nspecific phase-space point for all 2 \u2192 4 processes on the list in Ref. [6].\nThe process of WW+jet production is an important source for background to the production\nof a Higgs boson that subsequently decays into a W-boson pair, where additional jet activity\nmight arise from the production. In particular, it has been shown recently that the sensitivity\nof the Tevatron experiments CDF and D0 concerning the discovery of a Standard Model Higgs\nboson in the mass range 135\u2212190 GeV could improve significantly by studying H \u2192 W+ W\u2212 \u2192\nl+ l\u2212p/T together with an additional jet [7].\nWW+jet production delivers also potential background to new-physics searches, such as supersymmetric particles, because of leptons and missing transverse momentum from the W decays. Besides the process is interesting in its own right, since W-pair production processes\nenable a direct analysis of the non-abelian gauge-boson self-interactions, and a large fraction\nof W pairs will show up with additional jet activity at the LHC. Last but not least WW+jet at\nNLO also delivers the real\u2013virtual contributions to the next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO)\ncalculation of W-pair production, for which further building blocks are presented in Ref. [8].\nHere we report on the calculation of the process pp/pp\u0304 \u2192 W+ W\u2212 +jet + X in NLO QCD\nincluding leptonic W-boson decays. Results of this calculation on integrated cross sections,\nwhich are not sensitive to the W decays, have already been published in Ref. [9]. Parallel\nto our work, another NLO study [10] of pp \u2192 W+ W\u2212 +jet + X at the LHC appeared, where\nalso the W decays have been taken into account. Moreover, a third calculation focusing on\nWW+jet production is still in progress [11]. In Ref. [3] the three different approaches are briefly\ndescribed, and a detailed comparison of the virtual corrections at a single phase-space point is\npresented, revealing mutual agreement.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the general setup of the calculation, paying particular attention to the treatment of the various quark flavours. Section 3\nprovides details of the NLO calculation, and Section 4 describes the methods to include the\nW decays. Our detailed discussion of numerical results is presented in Section 5, which covers\nboth integrated and differential cross sections. In Section 6 we give our conclusions, and the\nAppendix contains a derivation of the improved narrow-width approximation.\n\n1\n\n\fW+\nu\n\ng\n\nW+\nu\n\nd, s\n\nu\nu\n\nd, s\ng\n\nW\u2212\nu\n\nW+\nd, s\n\nd, s\n\n\u016b\n\n\u016b\n\n\u016b\n\ng\n\nW\u2212\n\nW\u2212\n\ng\n\nW+\nu\n\nu\n\nZ, \u03b3\n\nu\n\nu\n\nW\u2212\n\n\u016b\n\n\u016b\n\nW+\nZ, \u03b3\n\ng\n\nW\u2212\n\nFigure 1: Diagrams contributing to one specific LO subprocess: The two W bosons couple\ndirectly to the fermion chain (upper diagrams) or by means of an intermediate neutral gauge\nboson (lower diagrams).\n2 Leading-order calculation and calculational framework\nAt leading order (LO), hadronic WW+jet production receives contributions from the partonic processes qq\u0304 \u2192 W+ W\u2212 g, qg \u2192 W+ W\u2212 q, and gq\u0304 \u2192 W+ W\u2212 q\u0304, where q stands for up- or\ndown-type quarks. Note that the amplitudes for q = u, d are not the same, even for vanishing\nlight-quark masses. All three channels are related by crossing symmetry. The LO diagrams for\nthe sample process u\u016b \u2192 W+ W\u2212 g are shown in Figure 1.\n2.1 Quark-mixing effects\nTo very good approximation the Cabibbo\u2013Kobayashi\u2013Maskawa (CKM) matrix can be assumed to be of block-diagonal form allowing mixing only between the two light generations,\nnamely\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nVud Vus 0\ncos \u03b8C sin \u03b8C 0\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nVCKM = \uf8ed Vcd Vcs 0 \uf8f8 = \uf8ed \u2212 sin \u03b8C cos \u03b8C 0 \uf8f8 ,\n(2.1)\n0 0 1\n0\n0 1\n\nwhere \u03b8C denotes the Cabibbo angle. The approximation is justified by the fact that the neglected off-diagonal matrix elements are very small. Moreover, ignoring the masses of the light\nquarks, the dependence on the CKM matrix drops out for a remarkable set of subprocesses. For\npp/pp\u0304 \u2192 WW + jet + X, this happens if both W bosons couple to the same fermion chain, as\nillustrated in Figure 2. Independent of gluonic couplings to this fermion chain, which do not\naffect the electroweak structure, the unitarity of the CKM matrix leads to\nX\nX\nX\nX \u2020\n\u2020\n\u2217\n\u2217\n= \u03b4UU\u2032 ,\n=\nVU\u2032 D VDU\nVU\u2032 D VUD\nVUD\nVD\u2032 U VUD = \u03b4DD\u2032 ,\n(2.2)\n\u2032 VUD =\nD=d,s\n\nD=d,s\n\nU=u,c\n\n2\n\nU=u,c\n\n\fW+\nW+\n\nU\nD = d, s\n\nW\u2212\n\nW\u2212\n\nU\u2032\n\nW+\nZ, \u03b3\nD\u2032\n\nD\nU = u, c\n\nQ\n\nW\u2212\nQ\u2032\n\nFigure 2: Electroweak part of diagrams with two W bosons coupling directly to the same\nfermion chain (left and central diagram): With light-quark masses neglected, all contributions\nwith U , U\u2032 or D , D\u2032 vanish in the block-diagonal approximation of the CKM matrix due\nto cancellations between diagrams with different intermediate states. The contributions with\nU = U\u2032 or D = D\u2032 behave as in the case of a trivial (unit) CKM matrix. Diagrams with an intermediate neutral electroweak vector boson (right diagram) do not depend on the CKM matrix,\nand thus Q = Q\u2032 holds.\nW+\nU\nU\u2032\nD\nD\u2032\n\nW\u2212\n\nD\u0304\nD\u0304\u2032\n\nFigure 3: A sample diagram with two W bosons coupling to different fermion chains: Contributions of this kind yield a non-trivial dependence on the CKM matrix elements.\nwith the nomenclature of Figure 2, when the intermediate quark state is summed over. Diagrams\nwith the W-boson pair coupling to the fermion chain by means of an intermediate vector boson\nare independent of the CKM matrix anyway. Therefore, a remarkable set of subprocesses of\npp/pp\u0304 \u2192 WW + jet + X is not influenced by the explicit entries of the CKM matrix due to its\nunitarity.\nThe only subprocesses contributing to pp/pp\u0304 \u2192 WW + jet + X that depend on the explicit\nentries of the CKM matrix are those containing two fermion chains with the two W bosons\ncoupling to different fermion chains at least in some diagrams. These are the real-emission\nsubprocesses including both two external up-type and two down-type (anti-)quarks. A sample\ndiagram is shown in Figure 3.\n2.2 Treatment of bottom (anti-)quarks\nThe situation of a hard jet resulting from an outgoing bottom (anti-)quark has to be considered with care: The long bottom lifetime results in a resolvable second vertex that is displaced\nfrom the primary interaction point, allowing in principle to tag the bottom flavour. This, however, does not imply that all events involving outgoing bottom quarks can be separated. For\ninstance, in real-emission subprocesses only one of the two outgoing jets must be detected:\nThis can be the light jet as well, while the b-jet leaves the detector unseen in direction of the\nbeam axis. Moreover, the b-tagging efficiency is below 100%, so that not all \"b-jet events\"\n3\n\n\fcan be isolated. The influence of incoming bottom (anti-)quarks on the hadronic cross section\nis suppressed with respect to other incoming (anti-)quarks by the small bottom PDFs in the\ncolliding hadrons.\nIn the process class pp/pp\u0304 \u2192 WW + jet + X, however, the suppression of subprocesses with\nexternal bottom (anti-)quarks may be overcompensated by top resonances, always showing up\nalong with final-state bottom (anti-)quarks. Moreover, outgoing bb\u0304 pairs appearing in realemission subprocesses even contain two potentially resonant top-quark propagators in some\ndiagrams without PDF suppression. These subprocesses should, however, in general not be\nassigned to WW+jet production, since they are actually off-shell continuations of tt\u0304 production.\nFrom this point of view, the subprocesses with only one outgoing bottom (anti-)quark can be\nseen as contributions to W\u2212 t production or W+ t\u0304 production, with the off-shell decay of the\ntop (anti-)quark included. In our approach, precisely described in the following, we exclude\nthese resonance reactions upon omitting contributions from channels involving external bottom\n(anti-)quarks. Thus, if desired, contributions from these channels could be easily added, but\ntheir calculation requires a consistent treatment of top (anti-)quarks as unstable particles, as for\ninstance provided by the complex-mass scheme [19, 20].\nFor the calculation of cross sections, we follow two different strategies regarding the treatment of bottom (anti-)quarks:\n(i)\n\nFive-flavour scheme\n\nIn the first approach, bottom (anti-)quarks are treated as massless particles, so five-flavour\nPDFs and a five-flavour running of \u03b1s are used. In this framework, the strategy is to neglect\nall contributions containing external bottom (anti-)quarks. For the initial state, this approach\nis justified by the smallness of their PDFs. Final-state bottom (anti-)quarks are excluded by\nthe assumption that their signal can be distinguished from that of a light-quark jet by means of\nb-tagging.\nAn advantage of this procedure can be seen in the fact that the influence of the off-shell\ncontinuations of tt\u0304, W\u2212 t, and W+ t\u0304 production, which is explained in the foregoing passage, is\nsimply left away. The respective contributions should be added to dedicated calculations for\nthese processes. Note, however, that the naive application of this procedure would lead to an\nill-defined cross section containing mass singularities. The problem is due to the g \u2192 bb\u0304 splitting which by anti-b-tagging would be removed from the real corrections. This contribution is\nrequired to cancel the mass singularities from the bottom-quark loop in the gluon self-energy\ncontributing to the virtual corrections. We treat this case similar to what has been done in\nRef. [21] and is also discussed in Ref. [22]. If the two bottom quarks are combined according\nto the applied jet algorithm the resulting jet carries no (net) b-charge and is thus counted as a\n\"light\" jet. On the other hand if the two bottom quarks form two individual jets we assume\nthem as tagged and ignore this configuration. Applying this procedure restricts the phase-space\nintegration to the collinear configurations which are needed to cancel the mass singularities in\nthe virtual corrections. Within the dipole subtraction formalism we combine the corresponding\nintegrated dipoles with the virtual corrections to obtain a finite result. In addition one obtains\na contribution from the real matrix element with the unintegrated dipoles subtracted. However\nthis contribution is only integrated over the collinear phase space region. Since in this region\nthe unintegrated dipoles approximate the real matrix elements we can ignore this contribution\nto very good approximation. The case in which the bottom-quark pair is not produced via gluon\n4\n\n\fsplitting is highly suppressed by anti-b-tagging. The neglected contribution only delivers sizeable contributions from diagrams including resonant top quarks. Exactly these contributions,\nhowever, are meant to be left out, because they should actually be assigned to different process\nclasses.\n(ii) \"Four-flavour scheme\"\nIn the second approach, the bottom (anti-)quarks are understood as massive particles. We\nuse four-flavour PDF's to describe the parton contents of the proton. Here, no top resonances\nshow up, since no bottom-(anti-)quark densities are taken into account and no mixing between\nthe two light and the third generation takes place in the chosen approximation of the CKM\nmatrix. As a consequence no single outgoing bottom (anti-)quarks appear. No bb\u0304 pairs are\ntaken into account in final states which is justified by assuming anti-b-tagging. The running\nof \u03b1s is driven only by the four remaining light quarks with both bottom- and top-quark loops\nin the gluon self-energies subtracted at zero momentum. As explained in Section 3, no large\ncorrections arise from terms proportional to \u03b1s ln mb , because counterterms always contribute\nin the combination 12 \u03b4ZA + \u03b4Zgs . Thus, the \u03b1s ln mb term from the renormalization of the strong\ncoupling cancels against the corresponding term from the wave-function renormalization of the\ngluon. In this scheme, such a cancellation always takes place if the number of external gluons\nis equal to the number of strong couplings in the considered LO process.\n3 Details of the NLO calculation\nIn order to prove the correctness of our results we have evaluated each ingredient twice using\nindependent calculations based-as far as possible-on different methods, yielding results in\nmutual agreement.\n3.1 Virtual corrections\nThe virtual corrections modify the partonic processes that are already present at LO. At\nNLO these corrections are induced by self-energy, vertex, box (4-point), and pentagon (5-point)\ncorrections. For illustration the pentagon graphs, which are the most complicated diagrams, are\nshown in Figure 4 for one partonic channel. At one-loop level WW+jet production also serves\nas an off-shell continuation of the loop-induced process of Higgs+jet production with the Higgs\nboson decaying into a W-boson pair. In these diagrams the off-shell Higgs boson is coupled\nvia a heavy-quark loop to two gluons; the graphs for this mechanism are shown in Figure 5\ntogether with vertex-correction diagrams with an intermediate electroweak vector boson. The\nHiggs resonance is included in our calculation upon employing a fixed decay width \u0393H , i.e. by\n2 ) by (p2 \u2212 M 2 + iM \u0393 ), where p and M\nreplacing the propagator denominator (p2H \u2212 MH\nH H\nH\nH\nH\nH\ndenote the momentum and the mass of the Higgs boson. The box contributions to the fermionic\ncorrections are depicted in Figure 6.\nAn on-shell renormalization is performed for the wave functions of the external QCD partons and an MS renormalization for the strong coupling with the massive-quark loops in the\n\n5\n\n\fg\n\nW+\nu\n\nu\n\nu\n\nu\n\nu\n\nu\n\nd, s\n\nd, s\n\nu\nW\u2212\n\ng\n\nW+\n\nu\n\u016b\n\nW+\n\nd, s\n\nu\n\nd, s\n\nu\n\n\u016b\n\nu\n\n\u016b\n\ng\n\nW\u2212\n\nW\u2212\n\nW+\nu\n\nu\n\nd, s\ng\n\nu\n\n\u016b\n\nW\u2212\n\nFigure 4: Pentagon diagrams for u\u016b \u2192 W+ W\u2212 g.\n\nW+\n\nW+\n\nq\n\nq\nH\n\nH\n\nq\u2032\n\nq\u2032\nq\u2032\n\nq\u0304\n\nW\u2212\n\nq\u2032\n\nq\u2032\n\nq\n\nq\u0304\n\nq\u2032\n\ng\n\ng\n\nW+\n\nW+\nq\n\nZ, \u03b3\nq\u2032\n\nZ, \u03b3\nq\u2032\n\nq\u2032\nq\u0304\n\nW\u2212\n\nW\u2212\n\nq\u2032\n\nq\u2032\n\nq\u0304\ng\n\nW\u2212\n\nq\u2032\ng\n\nFigure 5: Fermionic vertex-correction diagrams with intermediate electroweak bosons for\nqq\u0304 \u2192 W+ W\u2212 g.\n\n6\n\n\fg\n\nW+\nq\n\nq\n\nui\ndj\nui\n\nui\nui\n\nq\u0304\n\nq\n\nui\n\ng\n\ndj\nq\u0304\n\ndj\n\ndj\n\ndj\n\nW+\ndj\n\nq\ndj\n\ng\n\nq\u0304\n\ng\n\ng\n\nui\n\nW\u2212\n\nui\n\nq\u0304\n\nq\nui\n\nui\n\nW\u2212\n\nW+\ndj\n\nui\ndj\n\nW+\n\ndj\n\nW\u2212\n\nq\n\nW+\n\nui\n\nW+\ndj\n\nui\n\nq\u0304\n\nW\u2212\n\ndj\n\nq\u0304\n\nW\u2212\n\nW\u2212\n\ng\n\nFigure 6: Fermionic box diagrams for qq\u0304 \u2192 W+ W\u2212 g.\ngluon self-energy subtracted at zero momentum.

Both UV and IR (soft and collinear) divergences\nare regularized in D = 4 \u2212 2\u01eb dimensions, and the divergences arising as poles in \u01eb are quantified\nby\n\u0013\u01eb\n\u0012\n4\u03c0\u03bc2 \u0393(1 + \u01eb)\n,\nk = 1, 2,\n(3.5)\n\u2206k (\u03bc) =\n2\n\u01ebk\nMW\nwhere \u03bc is the arbitrary reference scale of dimensional regularization. Superscripts \"UV\" or\n\"IR\" on \u2206k (\u03bc) indicate the origin of the divergences.\nAs is well known, the use of the Dirac matrix \u03b35 deserves some care within dimensional\nregularization, because the Dirac algebra with \u03b35 does not admit a straightforward analytical\n7\n\n\fcontinuation to D , 4 dimensions. In both calculations of the virtual corrections we use a simple\nrecipe with a \u03b35 that anticommutes with all other Dirac matrices but nevertheless obeys the usual\ntrace relations from four dimensions.1 Although this approach is, of course, not fully consistent\nfrom the mathematical point of view, it is well known that it delivers the correct results at NLO\nas long as closed fermions loops are calculated \"generically\", i.e. they are calculated for general\nfermion flavours followed by a subsequent summation over all fermions by only changing the\nquantum numbers. The arguments supporting this scheme in the presence of UV divergences\ncan be found in Ref. [41] (see also references therein). In view of dimensionally regularized IR\ndivergences, the situation is much simpler because of their factorization off tree-level structures.\nAs long as it is guaranteed that these residual tree structures are treated in the same way in the\nvirtual and real corrections, between which the cancellations of IR divergences take place, the\nIR-finite sum is well defined. In fact for the compensation of IR divergences no (anti-)commutation rules involving \u03b35 are needed at all. Since the naive scheme described above does not\ninduce any spurios terms from the regularization, it automatically delivers the correct IR-finite\nsum of virtual and real corrections.\nVersion 1 of the virtual corrections is essentially obtained as for the related processes of\ntt\u0304H [23] and tt\u0304+jet [24] production. Feynman diagrams and amplitudes are generated with\nFeynArts 1.0 [25] and further processed with in-house Mathematica routines, which automatically create an output in Fortran. The IR divergences (soft and collinear) are analytically separated from the finite remainder in terms of triangle subdiagrams, as described in Refs. [23, 26].\nThis separation, in particular, allows for a transparent evaluation of so-called rational terms\nthat originate from D-dependent terms multiplying IR divergences, which appear as single or\ndouble poles in \u01eb. As generally shown in Ref. [4], after properly separating IR from UV divergences such rational terms originating from IR divergences completely cancel; this general\nresult is confirmed in our explicit calculation. For the results presented in Ref. [9], the pentagon tensor integrals were directly reduced to box integrals following Ref. [27], while box and\nlower-point integrals were reduced \u00e0 la Passarino\u2013Veltman [28] to scalar integrals. This procedure completely avoids inverse Gram determinants of external momenta in the reduction step\nfrom 5-point to 4-point integrals, but the reduction of box and lower-point tensor integrals involves such inverse determinants via the Passarino\u2013Veltman algorithm. Although these inverse\ndeterminants jeopardize the numerical stability in regions where such determinants are small,\nsufficient numerical stability was already achieved. Meanwhile the tensor reduction has been\nfurther improved using the methods of Ref. [32]. In detail the reduction of pentagons is performed by the more recent procedure of Ref. [32] (similar to a method proposed in Ref. [33]),\nand the Passarino\u2013Veltman reduction for 4-point integrals, etc., is supplemented by the dedicated expansions for small Gram and kinematical determinants in the regions where these determinants become small.2 The scalar one-loop integrals are either calculated analytically or\nusing the results of Refs. [29\u201331].\nVersion 2 of the evaluation of loop diagrams starts with the generation of diagrams and\namplitudes via FeynArts 3.4 [35] which are then further manipulated with FormCalc 6.0 [36]\nand eventually automatically translated into Fortran code. The whole reduction of tensor to\n1\n\nThe authors of Ref. [11] adopted the more rigorous, but cumbersome approach of 't Hooft and Veltman [40],\nwhere \u03b35 is split into an anticommuting four-dimensional part and a commuting remainder, and find full agreement\nwith our result (see also Ref. [3] for some details).\n2 Similar procedures based on expansions in small determinants have also been proposed in Ref. [34].\n\n8\n\n\fscalar integrals is done with the help of the LoopTools library [36], which employs the method\nof Ref. [27] for the 5-point tensor integrals, Passarino\u2013Veltman [28] reduction for the lowerpoint tensors, and the FF package [37, 38] for the evaluation of regular scalar integrals. The\ndimensionally regularized soft or collinear singular 3- and 4-point integrals had to be added\nto this library. To this end, the explicit results of Ref. [26] for the vertex and of Ref. [39] for\nthe box integrals (with appropriate analytical continuations) are taken. Actually the FormCalc\npackage assumes a four-dimensional regularization scheme for IR divergences (such as the\nconcept of an infinitesimal photon mass in QED), i.e. rational terms of IR origin are neglected\nby FormCalc. However, as mentioned above, in Ref. [4] it was generally shown that such\nrational terms consistently cancel if UV and IR divergences are properly separated. Owing to\nthis property the algebraic result of FormCalc for the unrenormalized amplitudes could be used\nwithout any modification, apart from supplementing the needed IR-singular scalar integrals.\n3.2 Real corrections\nThe matrix elements for the real corrections are given by the processes 0 \u2192 W+ W\u2212 qq\u0304gg and\n0 \u2192 W+ W\u2212 qq\u0304q\u2032 q\u0304\u2032 with a large variety of flavour insertions for the light quarks q and q\u2032 . The\npartonic processes are obtained from these matrix elements by all possible crossings of quarks\nand gluons into the initial state. The evaluation of the real-emission amplitudes is performed in\ntwo independent ways. Both evaluations employ (independent implementations of) the dipole\nsubtraction formalism [42] for the extraction of IR singularities and for their combination with\nthe virtual corrections.\nVersion 1 employs the Weyl\u2013van-der-Waerden formalism (as described in Ref. [43]) for the\ncalculation of the helicity amplitudes. The phase-space integration is performed by a multichannel Monte Carlo integrator [44] with weight optimization [45] written in C++, which is\nconstructed similar to RacoonWW [19,46]. The results for cross sections with two resolved hard\njets have been checked against results obtained with Whizard 1.50 [47] and Sherpa 1.0.8 [48].\nDetails on this part of the calculation can be found in Ref. [49]. In order to improve the integration, additional channels are included for the integration of the difference of the real-emission\nmatrix elements and the subtraction terms.\nVersion 2 is based on scattering amplitudes calculated with Madgraph [50] generated code.\nThe code has been modified to allow for a non-diagonal quark mixing matrix and the extraction\nof the required colour and spin structures. The latter enter the evaluation of the dipoles in the\nCatani\u2013Seymour subtraction method. The evaluation of the individual dipoles was performed\nusing a C++ library developed during the calculation of the NLO corrections for tt\u0304+jet [24]. For\nthe phase-space integration a simple mapping has been used where the phase space is generated\nfrom a sequential splitting.\nIn the Catani\u2013Seymour dipole subtraction formalism all the IR divergent pieces with LO\nkinematics are collected in the so-called I-operator-for details we refer to Ref. [42]. Since\nthe IR finiteness of the virtual corrections combined with the IR singularities obtained from the\nreal corrections provides an important check of the calculation, we reproduce here the explicit\nform of the I-operator,\nZ\n\u03b1s\nI(pa , pb ; . . . , pi ) = d\u03c3A\n|ALO,ab (pa , pb ; . . . , pi )|2\nab (pa , pb ; . . . pi ) = \u2212\n2\u03c0\n1\n9\n\n\f\u001a\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n10\n2pb pi\n2pa pi\n\u00d7\n\u2212 ln 2 \u2212 ln 2\n3\nMW\nMW\n\u0012\n\u0015\n\u0013\n2pa pi\n10\n2pb pi\n190 8\u03c02\n2 2pb pi\n2 2pa pi\nln 2 + ln 2\n+ ln\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n+ ln\n2\n2\n3\n9\n3\nMW\nMW\nMW\nMW\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0015\n\u0013\n2pa pb\n2pa pb\n4\u03c02\nIR\nIR\n2 2pa pb\n+4T R (CA \u2212 2CF ) 2\u22062 (\u03bc) + \u22061 (\u03bc) 3 \u2212 2 ln\n+ ln\n\u2212 3 ln\n+ 10 \u2212\n2\n2\n2\n3\nMW\nMW\nMW\n\u0012\n\u0015\u001b\n\u0013\n\u0014\n2pa pi\n2\n2pb pi\n32\n4\nln 2 + ln 2\n+ O(\u01eb),\n(3.6)\n\u2212\n\u22124T R2 N f \u2212 \u2206IR\n1 (\u03bc) +\n3\n3\n9\nMW\nMW\nIR\n\u22124T R CA 4\u2206IR\n2 (\u03bc) + 2\u22061 (\u03bc)\n\nwhere ALO,ab denotes the colour-stripped LO amplitude for the incoming quark\u2013antiquark pair\nab and the outgoing gluon i. Due to the simple colour structure the I-operator does not involve\nnon-trivial colour correlations. The I-operators for the remaining subprocesses are obtained by\nexchanging the respective momenta and using the crossed matrix elements.\n4 Inclusion of gauge-boson decays\nSince the produced W bosons are unstable particles, their decays should be included into\nthe analysis. In this context, especially the case of both gauge bosons decaying leptonically\nis of interest due to its clean signature in the detector. Therefore, only leptonic gauge-boson\ndecays are considered here. The inclusion of the decays is performed following three different\nstrategies for the LO processes, which are presented in the following paragraphs. The improved\nnarrow-width approximation-the on-shell approximation together with the exact treatment of\nthe W-polarization-delivers an appropriate compromise between the complexity of the calculations and the accuracy of the results, which is demonstrated in a comparison of LO results\npresented in Section 5.3.1. Therefore, the NLO calculation is performed by means of the improved narrow-width approximation.\n4.1 Full calculation with off-shell W bosons\nThe diagrams contributing to pp/pp\u0304 \u2192 ll\u0304\u2032 \u03bdl\u2032 \u03bd\u0304l + jet + X can be subdivided into two classes,\nnamely diagrams showing two gauge-boson propagators that can become resonant and other\ndiagrams containing only one W resonance. The doubly-resonant diagrams comprise all the\nWW+jet-production diagrams of Figure 7 with the two massive gauge bosons decaying into\nleptons.\nAside from this doubly-resonant group, a number of diagrams that in general contain only\none possibly resonant gauge-boson propagator contributes. Their topologies are characterized\nby the situation that one neutral gauge boson decays to a lepton\u2013antilepton pair with the second\npair attached to this leptonic fermion chain via a W boson. All diagrams for this configuration\nare given in Figure 8 for one specific partonic channel. The configuration with both the Z and\nthe W propagator being resonant is kinematically allowed, but does not significantly contribute,\nsince the corresponding phase-space region is too small.\nThe singularities appearing at the poles of the LO gauge-boson propagators are treated by\nintroducing decay widths in the propagators.

Further improvements would go\nbeyond NLO QCD accuracy.\n\n4.2 Narrow-width approximation\nIn the naive narrow-width approximation (NWA), the produced W bosons are treated as\non-shell particles in the production process. The leptonic decays are assumed to be isotropic\nin the rest frames of the respective W bosons, because their spin information from the production process is dropped.

The analogous NWA diagrams are collected in Figure 9 for one LO subprocess.\n4.3 Improved narrow-width approximation\nIn the comparison that is presented in Section 5.3.1 for LO calculations, the naive NWA\nturns out to be not satisfactory. While the integrated cross sections show modest deviations\nbetween the full amplitude calculation and the naive NWA, large discrepancies arise in some\nphase-space regions if differential cross sections are considered.\nAn appropriate compromise between the full calculation and the naive NWA is obtained\nby an improved NWA (iNWA). Here, the gauge bosons are still treated as on-shell particles,\nbut their spin information is kept. It is used to improve the description of the leptonic Wboson decays, which are not isotropic in the respective W-boson rest frames owing to the V \u2212 A\n13\n\n\fstructure of the decay. Details on how to keep the spin information of the decaying gauge\nbosons are provided in App. A.\nThe diagrams that are relevant for the iNWA are the same as for the NWA, which are shown\nin Figure 9 for one specific channel in LO. The modification of amplitudes is essentially the\nsame for LO subprocesses and all contributions to the NLO QCD cross section: the polarization\nvector of each of the outgoing gauge bosons is replaced by the leptonic currents of its decay\nproducts. For the rest of the production amplitude, the momenta of the gauge bosons are set\non shell. The Breit\u2013Wigner propagators arising in the absolute square of the amplitudes are\nseparated. They are replaced by delta functions with an appropriate normalization obtained by\nintegrating over the Breit\u2013Wigner propagator in the limit \u0393V \u2192 0.\nSince the iNWA turns out to reproduce the full calculation to sufficient accuracy in the LO\ncomparison of Section 5.3.1, this strategy for describing the leptonic decays is applied for the\nNLO QCD calculations.\n5 Numerical results\n5.1 Setup and input parameters\nFor the numerical evaluations, the following SM parameters [51] are used,\nMW = 80.425 GeV , MZ = 91.1876 GeV , G\u03bc = 1.16637 \u00d7 10\u22125 GeV\u22122 ,\nMH = 150 GeV , \u0393H = 0.017 GeV , mt = 174.3 GeV .\n\n(5.1)\n\nThe total Higgs-boson width \u0393H has been calculated with Hdecay [52]. The only contribution\nfrom a Higgs boson at NLO QCD is given by the loop diagams in Figure 5. Since these diagrams\nturn out to contribute less than 0.3% to the cross sections for the chosen Higgs mass, their impact\nis not investigated further.3 The electromagnetic coupling \u03b1 is evaluated from (5.1) via\n\u0010\n2 \u0011\n\u221a\nMW\n2\n2G\u03bc MW 1 \u2212 M2\nZ\n\u03b1 = \u03b1G\u03bc =\n.\n(5.2)\n\u03c0\nThis choice of \u03b1 absorbs some universal corrections to the electroweak coupling (running of\n\u03b1 to the electroweak scale, leading corrections to the \u03c1-parameter), as is explained, e.g., in\nRef. [53]. The widths of the weak gauge bosons are calculated according to Eqs. (4.3) and\n(4.4)-in case of the production of stable weak gauge bosons they are, of course, set to zero-\nfrom all decay channels at NLO QCD with the fermion masses neglected. With the value of the\nstrong coupling at the scale MZ taken from Ref. [54],\n\u03b1s (MZ ) = 0.1176 ,\n\n(5.3)\n\nthe calculated widths are\n\u0393W = 2.0996 GeV ,\n\n\u0393Z = 2.5097 GeV .\n\n3\n\n(5.4)\n\nFor MH > 2MW the included Higgs-boson effects account for the interference between a H(\u2192 WW) +jet signal\nand the coherent irreducible WW + jet background. A proper description of the signal requires, of course, also the\nsquared resonance diagrams and contributions from gg fusion with the corresponding radiative corrections.\n\n14\n\n\fThe SM parameters already used in the publications on WW+jet production [3, 9, 55, 56]\nare not replaced by the more recent values [54] in order to facilitate comparisons; the numerical\nimpact of the slightly changed measured value of MW is negligible anyway at the required\naccuracy.\nThe values for the strong coupling in the amplitude calculation are evaluated according to a\n1-loop-running at LO and a 2-loop-running at NLO as described in Ref.

The values of \u039bQCD are chosen as prescribed by the applied PDF sets:\nIn the five-flavour scheme, the PDFs of CTEQ6 [58,59] are used with Nf = 5, namely CTEQ6L1\nwith \u039bQCD = 165 MeV at LO and CTEQ6M with \u039bQCD = 226 MeV at NLO. In the four-flavour\nscheme, the PDFs of MRST2004 [60] with Nf = 4 are taken, namely MRST2004F4LO with\n\u039bQCD = 220 MeV at LO and MRST2004F4NLO with \u039bQCD = 347 MeV at NLO. The renormalization of \u03b1s is performed as described in Section 3.1, i.e. with the heavy-quark loops in the\ngluon self-energy decoupled: In the five-flavour scheme only the top-quark loop is decoupled,\nin the four-flavour scheme both the top- and the bottom-quark loops are decoupled.\nThe Cabbibo angle in the approximation (2.1) for the CKM matrix is set to\n\u03b8C = 0.227 ,\n\n(5.7)\n\nthe explicit entries are calculated from this.\nTo give an IR-safe definition of the cross section we apply the successive-combination jet\nalgorithm of Ref. [61] with R = 1 to decide whether two final-state partons can be resolved as\ntwo separated jets or whether they have to be combined to only one jet. A dependence on the\nspecific jet algorithm only arises through the real-emission subprocesses, because the LO and\nall other NLO contributions contain only one parton in the final state which is identified with the\njet. To resolve the additional hadronic jet, a cut on the transverse momentum is applied. This\nrenders the cross section also IR safe which would otherwise diverge already at LO. Different\nvalues are used for pT,jet,cut which are explicitly given for the respective results.\nIf the weak-gauge-boson decays are included, a set of additional cuts is applied which is in\ngeneral not necessary for the finiteness of cross sections, but provides results that are closer to\nthe experimental situation. These additional cuts are\n|\u03b7jet | < 4.5 ,\n\npT,lepton > 25 GeV ,\n\n|\u03b7lepton | < 2.5 ,\n\n(5.8)\n\nwhere \u03b7 is the pseudo-rapidity and pT the transverse momentum of the respective particle. All\nleptonic cuts are applied only to charged leptons, of course. As an additional condition the\nmissing transverse momentum, which is deduced from the sum of the neutrino momenta, is\nrequired to obey\npT,miss > 25 GeV .\n15\n\n(5.9)\n\n\fThe missing transverse momentum is particularly of interest if WW+jet is considered as a background process for SUSY searches. Here, the missing transverse momentum mimics the lightest\nsupersymmetric particle that also leaves the detector undetected.\nFurthermore, isolation cuts are applied in order to separate all visible leptons from each\nother and from hadronic jets,\nRlepton,jet > 0.4 ,\n\nRlepton,lepton > 0.2 ,\n\n(5.10)\n\np\nwhere Rab = (\u2206\u03c6ab )2 + (\u2206\u03b7ab )2 . The angular distance between the two particles a, b in the\ntransverse plane is denoted by \u2206\u03c6ab , and \u2206\u03b7ab is the difference of their pseudo-rapidities.\n5.2 Results on integrated cross sections\nWe start our discussion of numerical results with integrated cross sections. In order to render\nthese cross sections insensitive to the decay of the W bosons, we do not apply the cuts on the\ndecay leptons specified in Eqs. (5.8)\u2013(5.10) in this section.\n5.2.1 LO cross sections\nThe LO cross sections get contributions from qq\u0304, qg, and gq\u0304 initial states. In this section,\nthe relevance \u221a\nof the respective partonic channels is discussed both for results on \u221a\nproton\u2013proton\ncollisions at s = 14 TeV (LHC setup) and on proton\u2013antiproton collisions at s = 1.96 TeV\n(Tevatron setup). Scale variations of a factor 10 around the central scale, which is chosen to be\nMW , are considered. Here and in the following sections, the common scale \u03bc = \u03bcren = \u03bcfact is\nused, i.e. renormalization and factorization scales are set equal and are varied simultaneously.\nFigure 10 shows the results for the various partonic contributions to WW+jet production,\nevaluated in the five-flavour scheme. At the LHC, each partonic process involves at most one\nvalence quark. Therefore, the gluon flux, which is essentially larger at the LHC compared to\nTevatron, in general leads to larger contributions from qg channels compared to qq\u0304 annihilation,\nwhereas the gq\u0304 initial states contribute significantly less since no valence partons are involved\nhere. The situation at Tevatron is different, because the proton\u2013antiproton collisions provide qq\u0304\ncontributions with two valence partons that dominate the cross sections. The scale dependence\nof the cross sections at Tevatron turns out to be stronger than at LHC, which is due to the\nfactorization-scale variation. While the renormalization-scale variation only reflects the running\nof the strong coupling \u03b1s , which is the same in both cases, the factorization scale dependence\nis quite flat for nearly all channels at LHC in the considered range. At Tevatron, however, an\nincrease of roughly the same order as the one arising from the renormalization-scale dependence\nis found in the direction of lower scales. A detailed analysis of the scale dependence of LO cross\nsections to WW+jet production is provided in Ref. [49].\nIn case of the LHC, the partonic contributions with up-type quarks dominate over those\nwith down-type quarks, which can be understood by comparing the valence-quark PDFs in the\nprotons. The antiquark PDFs of the lightest generation result in an inverted order of the gq\u0304 channels at the LHC where the gd\u0304 channel prevails the g\u016b contribution. For Tevatron, the described\nvalence-PDF effect occurs twice in the qq\u0304 channel, leading roughly to a factor 4 between u\u016b\nand dd\u0304. The channels qg and gq\u0304 deliver exactly the same contribution to the integrated cross\nsections due to the charge-conjugation-invariant hadronic initial state. Naturally, the channels\n16\n\n\f\u001bLO [pb\u2104\n\n\u001bLO [pb\u2104\n\n10\n\n1\n0.1\n\n1\n\ntotal (no bs)\nug; g\u0016\nu\n\u0016\ndg; gd\n\u0016\nu\u0016\nu; d d\n\u0016\nbg; gb\n\u0016\nbb\n\n0.1\n0.01\n\npp !

If more than one curve with identical colours is given, the first one mentioned in the key\ncorresponds to the upper curve. The contribution named \"total\" does not contain contributions\nfrom external bottom quarks.\ninvolving valence-(anti-)quarks dominate, and therefore the described PDF effect leads again to\nlarger contributions from ug/g\u016b compared to dg/gd\u0304.\nIn addition, for both colliders the channels involving bottom flavours are shown in Figure 10.\nAs expected, bb\u0304 annihilation is numerically negligible in both cases, whereas the bg channel\nand the gb\u0304 channel-whose contributions to the integrated cross section are the same-each\naccount roughly for the same amount as all the subprocesses involving (anti-)quarks of the\ntwo light generations at the LHC. As already explained in Section 2.2, this is due to the fact\nthat these subprocesses actually describe resonant and non-resonant W\u2212 t and W+ t\u0304 production,\nrespectively, with the top decays included. In addition the bottom PDF is due to the gluon\nsplitting g \u2192 bb\u0304. The bg-flux is thus rather large at the LHC due to the large gluon lumionsity.\nAs mentioned earlier the corresponding contributions should be attributed to different processes,\ntherefore these channels and the respective NLO corrections are not taken into account. For\nTevatron, their numerical impact is not that large, since the centre-of-mass (CM) energy to\nproduce top resonances in addition to a W boson is rarely available and the gluon flux is small.\nThe respective channels are, however, treated in the same way as for the LHC. The different\nshapes of the scale-variation curves with bottom flavours result from a strong decrease of the\nbottom PDFs for smaller values of the factorization scale.\n5.2.2 NLO QCD cross sections\nAfter analyzing the individual contributions to the LO cross sections in the previous section,\nthe effects of NLO QCD corrections on the WW+jet cross sections are discussed here. For\nthe numerical results of this and the following sections, two different definitions of the NLO\nobservables are used. The one observable is defined more inclusively by only requiring at least\n\n17\n\n\f50\n\u001b[pb\u2104\n40\n\npp !

Contributions from external bottom (anti-)quarks are omitted,\nas described in Section 2.2.\none hard jet with a minimum transverse momentum after application of the jet algorithm. The\nmore exclusively defined observable applies a veto on a second separable hard jet and describes\ntherefore genuine WW+jet production. To this end, real-correction events with two jets that\nfulfill the pT,jet,cut condition and are not combined by the jet algorithm are not counted in the\nmore exclusive observable. The phase-space regions in the real-correction subprocesses that are\nrelevant for curing infrared singularities from the virtual corrections are not influenced, since the\napplied restriction only refers to genuine WW+2jets events. Therefore, the difference between\nthe results for the two NLO observables is precisely given by the respective LO observable of\nWW+2jets production-evaluated, however, in the NLO setup (NLO PDFs, 2-loop running of\n\u03b1s ).\n(i)\n\nFour-flavour versus five-flavour scheme and scale dependence of NLO QCD cross sections\n\nWe start the discussion of the scale dependence of the NLO cross sections with a comparison between the results obtained in the four-flavour and the five-flavour schemes, respectively,\nas described in Section 2.2. The NLO QCD cross sections for WW+jet production are presented in Figure 11 for the LHC setup with pT,jet,cut = 50 GeV and for the Tevatron setup with\npT,jet,cut = 20 GeV, both for the four-flavour calculations with MRST2004F4 PDFs and the fiveflavour calculations with CTEQ6 PDFs. In the four-flavour calculation, loop diagrams involving (massive) 3rd-generation quarks are included. However, their contributions account for less\nthan 0.2% to the integrated cross sections.\n\n18\n\n\fIn case of the LHC, the relative deviations between the NLO cross sections in the two\nschemes behave as follows: while the deviation significantly increases in direction of lower\nscales at LO, which leads, however, to relative deviations of less than 3% in the whole range,\nit is nearly flat for both NLO observables where the results deviate by less than 2%. For the\nTevatron, the comparison between the two approaches reveals deviations of less than 2% at LO\nover the full range of scale variations. The NLO cross sections turn out to be slightly larger\nin the CTEQ6 approach, but on a level of less than 4% for the whole range of interest. The\nsmallest scales depicted may be ignored, because they obviously describe a region where the\nNLO calculation is not a good approximation anymore, as one can see from the steep decline\nof the absolute values for the NLO cross sections in that range of scales.\nSince the results evaluated with different PDF sets can in general not be expected to agree\nexactly-not only in the present case where different descriptions of the bottom (anti-)quark are\napplied-this analysis can be seen as a confirmation that the approximation that is applied in\nthe five-flavour calculation delivers fully acceptable results. Moreover, the deviations between\nthe two approaches are far below the expected experimental errors. The good agreement has\nbeen further confirmed by performing the same comparison for pT,jet,cut = 100 GeV at LHC\nand for pT,jet,cut = 50 GeV at Tevatron, yielding the same level of agreement. In addition, also\ndifferential cross sections have been compared with no significant deviations showing up in any\nphase-space regions. Numerical results of these further comparisons are omitted here, because\nthey are not supposed to provide new insight. In the following, only the five-flavour scheme\nwith CTEQ6 PDFs is used.\nConsidering the scale dependence in the transition from LO to NLO at the LHC (see\nFigure 11), only a modest reduction is observed if W-boson pairs in association with two hard\njets are taken into account. This large residual scale dependence is mainly due to the qg channels, followed by those contributions with two valence quarks in the initial state that are present\nin the real corrections, but not at LO. The scale dependence can be significantly suppressed\nupon applying the veto of having \"no 2nd separable jet\". The relevance of a jet veto in order\nto suppress the scale dependence at NLO was also realized for genuine W-pair production at\nhadron colliders [62]. A reduction of the difference between the two curves, which represents-\nas mentioned in the beginning of this section-the contribution of genuine WW+2jets events,\nis also achieved by increasing the value of the cut on pT,jet , which is illustrated in Figure 12 for\nWW+jet production with pT,jet,cut > 100 GeV in the LHC setup and pT,jet,cut > 50 GeV for the\nTevatron. Explicit numbers for the cross sections-both with and without leptonic W decays-\nare collected in Tables 1 \u2013 4.\nIn general, the influence of the restriction on genuine WW+jet production via the described\njet veto is not that large in the Tevatron setup (see Figure 11). This can be understood from\nthe lower CM energy at the Tevatron: The energy for producing a second hard jet is available\nless frequently here, so that a stronger suppression of WW+2jets events is obtained. The fact\nthat the difference between the two NLO observables strongly decreases when going to higher\npT,jet,cut values-as shown on the right-hand side of Figure 12-confirms this interpretation.\nIn Figure 13, the respective plots are shown with the W decays included via the iNWA and\nwith further cuts applied according to Eqs. (5.8) \u2013 (5.10).

In Figure 14, the pT,jet,cut dependence is shown for the LHC and\nthe Tevatron setup, respectively. In order to introduce a measure for the scale uncertainties\nof the cross sections, bands are depicted that correspond to a variation of \u03bc = \u03bcren = \u03bcfact by a\nfactor 2 around the central scale. A crossing of the curves for differing scale values leads to\nvanishing band widths at some points, which is an artifact of how the results are depicted and\nshould not be misinterpreted as a vanishing scale uncertainty. In the plots of Figure 14, the band\ncorresponding to the more inclusive cross section is partially covered by the more exclusive one.\nBoth curves are, however, shown here in order to confirm the statement that the effect of genuine\nWW+2jets events decreases with an increasing value of pT,jet,cut . This becomes manifest in the\noverlap of the two bands especially for large cut values at the Tevatron, but is also evident in\n21\n\n\f25\n\u001b[pb\u2104\n20\n\n1.8\n\npp !

Eventually, the pT,jet,cut variation reflects the behaviour discussed in the\nprevious paragraph: For Tevatron, a considerable reduction of the scale uncertainty is achieved\nwhen going from LO to NLO, whereas this reduction is only mild for LHC unless WW+2jets\nevents are vetoed.\n5.3 Results on differential cross sections\nNow we mainly focus on differential distributions in observables defined from the W decay\nproducts, i.e. the cuts on the decay leptons specified in Eqs. (5.8)\u2013(5.10) are applied.\n5.3.1 LO analysis of the different decay descriptions\nThe integrated WW+jet cross section as defined above is not sensitive to the decays of the\nW bosons. An inclusion of leptonic decays into the calculation of WW+jet production can be\nperformed in different ways. In this section, a comparison of LO results for the three strategies\ndiscussed in Section 4 is performed, which are a full amplitude calculation within the complexmass scheme, the naive NWA, and its improved version iNWA that treats the W bosons as\non-shell particles, but keeps spin correlations. The aim of this discussion is to find an adequate\napproximation in order to avoid performing the full amplitude calculation but still to obtain an\nappropriate description of the decays.\nConsidering only integrated cross sections, both approximations reproduce the full results\nin the LHC setup at the expected accuracy of O(\u0393V /MV ). More precisely, we find a deviation\nof about 3% for the naive NWA and of less than 1% for the improved version with pT,jet,cut =\n50, 100 GeV. In the Tevatron setup, the naive NWA predicts cross sections deviating by roughly\n15% (9%) for pT,jet,cut = 20 GeV (50 GeV), while the iNWA is good within 1%. The differences\nbetween the two approximations are due to the ignored spin correlations in the naive NWA,\nwhich lead to different distributions of the decay leptons over the phase space.

The LO cross sections are evaluated at \u03bc = \u03bcfact = \u03bcren = MW for the full\namplitude calculation, the naive NWA, and the improved NWA.\nbecome manifest in the integrated cross sections if cuts on the decay products are applied. In\ngeneral, both the naive and the improved version of the NWA give the same integrated cross\nsections if no leptonic cuts are applied. This is due to the fact that taking the spin correlations\ninto account only causes a (W-polarization-dependent) redistribution of the momenta of the\ndecay leptons, which does not influence the result as long as the full decay phase spaces are\nintegrated over.\nDistributions in specific variables are, however, strongly affected, which can be seen from\nthe differential cross sections for the LHC given in Figures 15, 16, and 17. Only the distributions for decay leptons are shown there, because these are, naturally, mainly affected by\nthe different decay descriptions. Considering the distributions of transverse momentum pT and\npseudo-rapidity \u03b7 of each of the two decay leptons, the improved NWA delivers a very accurate\nreproduction of the full calculation, whereas the naive version deviates by up to 15% in some\nphase-space regions. The distributions of the angles between the two leptons-\u03c6 denotes the angle in the transverse plane and cos \u03b8 the cosine of the angle between the two leptons-resulting\nfrom the full amplitude calculation are also in general reproduced more precisely by the improved NWA.

The bands in the K-factors are precisely defined in\nthe text.\n\n28\n\n\f5.3.2 Differential NLO cross sections at the LHC\nA survey of distributions for differential WW+jet cross sections with leptonic W decays is\ngiven in Figures 20 \u2013 22 for the LHC setup with pT,jet,cut = 50 GeV and \u03bc = \u03bcren = \u03bcfact = MW .\nThe relative size of the NLO corrections is represented in terms of a K-factor. The depicted\nbands correspond to a variation of the scale \u03bc by a factor of 2 in the NLO quantities only, i.e.\nwe show \u03c3NLO (\u03bc)/\u03c3LO (MW ) with 0.5MW < \u03bc < 2MW .\nThe jet distributions are understood as distributions of the hardest jet. Figure 20 provides\ntransverse-momentum distributions of the hadronic jet, of the missing transverse momentum\ndue to (anti-)neutrinos leaving the detector undetected (upper plots), and of the two charged\ndecay leptons (lower plots). For all pT distributions, a tendency of the more exclusive NLO\ncross section to decrease faster than the LO cross section when going to higher values is evident.\nTo a large extent this is due to the fact that a fixed value is used for the renormalization scale.\nInstead, the transverse momentum of the jet seems a more appropriate scale in the high-pT tail,\nsince the only arising strong coupling concerns this jet. Using \u03b1s (MW ) in the LO calculation\noverestimates the contributions for large pT,jet values due to the ignored decrease of the QCD\ncoupling. In other words, the large pT,jet introduces an additional scale which is responsible\nfor a large logarithmic enhancement. These corrections may be absorbed into the running of\nthe strong coupling constant (and thus resummed to all orders) by using a more appropriate\nrenormalization scale, i.e. a scale that is set through pT,jet . Similar arguments can explain part\nof the behaviour at small pT observed in the respective plots of Figure 20, but of course the\ntheoretical description in regions of small transverse momenta should eventually be improved\nby dedicated resummations of higher-order QCD corrections.\nSince the leptonic transverse momenta are connected to pT,jet by momentum conservation, the same argumentation also holds for these distributions. The effects are, however,\nmuch stronger for the jet compared to the leptons due to the tendency of coloured particles to\ncollinearly radiate further QCD partons. For the more inclusive NLO observable, this effect is\novercompensated by genuine WW+2jets events which are-being actually LO contributions-\nalso influenced by this effect. In the pT distributions for the two decay leptons, a slight tendency to higher pT can be found for the lepton. That a difference between lepton and antilepton\narises at all can be understood from the defined order of the W bosons coupling to the fermion\nchain, because t-channel-like emissions of the W bosons cause large contributions. Whereas\na t-channel-like emission of a W+ can only arise in case of an incoming up quark or down\nantiquark, an analogous emission of a W\u2212 always stems from an incoming down quark or up\nantiquark. The antilepton always results from the W+ decay and the lepton from the W\u2212 decay.\nDue to the difference of the involved PDFs, the antilepton prefers lower transverse momenta\ncompared to the lepton.\nAn important impact of this effect can also be seen in the upper plots of Figure 21 where\ndistributions of the pseudo-rapidities of the leptons are depicted. Here, the antilepton shows a\nslightly larger tendency to small angles against the beam axes than the lepton. Naturally, due to\nthe symmetric hadronic initial state in proton\u2013proton collisions the pseudo-rapidity distributions\nare symmetric. The size of the relative NLO corrections turns out to be nearly independent of\nthese quantities-well described by a constant K-factor. The symmetry property still holds for\nthe pseudo-rapidity of the hadronic jet, which is shown in the lower plot of Figure 21. The NLO\ncorrections to this quantity, however, increase for larger pseudo-rapidities. These large positive\ncorrections in the region of large pseudo-rapidities can be understood by a simple statistical\n29\n\n\feffect: NLO corrections in general redistribute events via radiation. Since most events show\njets in the region of lower pseudo-rapidities, it is just more likely to redistribute events from the\nlow-pseudo-rapidity region to the high-pseudo-rapidity region than vice versa. Apart from this\nsmall phase-space region, which is negligible anyway if the total amount of events is considered,\nthe NLO corrections turn out to be nearly independent of the jet pseudo-rapidity as well.\nThe invariant-mass distribution of the charged leptons, which is shown in the lower right\nplot of Figure 21, depicts the typical behaviour of two particles that are not resonantly produced:\nwhile the steep increase at low invarint masses is mainly due to the lepton-separation cut and\nthe transverse-momentum cuts on the individual particles, the decrease to higher values reflects\nthe behaviour of all variables involving a new energy scale, according to the dependence of\nhadronic cross sections on the partonic centre-of-mass energy.\nThe two distributions in Figure 22 depict the angular correlations between the two decay\nleptons. The angle between the two leptons in the transverse plane is represented by \u03c6, which\nis a quantity invariant under boosts along the beam direction. By \u03b8 the opening angle between\nthese two leptons in the laboratory frame is denoted. Considering the \u03c6 distribution, i.e. ignoring the boost effect along the beam axes, the two charged leptons turn out to fly preferentially\ninto opposite directions. This is not surprising, since momentum conservation forces the two\nW bosons at least to show a tendency to opposite directions which is mediated to their decay\nproducts by boost effects. The angle between the leptons is, however, important for the distinction of the background process WW+jet from the signal process H(\u2192 WW\u2217 )+jet in Higgs\nsearches. This is due to the fact that the decay leptons of a W-boson pair arising from the decay\nof a scalar Higgs particle show the-on the first view non-intuitive-tendency to fly into the\nsame direction. This property results from the spin correlation of the W+ W\u2212 system, which is\ndiscussed in detail in Ref. [63]: Since, in the rest frame of the Higgs boson, the helicities of\nthe W bosons are correlated, and only a left-handed charged lepton and a right-handed charged\nantilepton can arise from the W decays, their emission in the same direction is favoured. This\ncorrelation effect is, of course, smeared in H(\u2192 WW\u2217 )+jet, since the Higgs boson is in general\nboosted, but a remainder of the effect should still be measurable.\nFor WW+jet production, however, the helicities of the two W bosons are not correlated in\nthis way, as depicted in Figure 22, but tend to opposite directions. In the cos \u03b8 distribution, this\npreference is overcompensated by the boost effect along the beam axes, leading to a tendency\nin direction of small opening angles. The dependence of the size of NLO corrections on both\nangles turns out to be of the order of 10\u201320%.\n5.3.3 Differential NLO cross sections at the Tevatron\nConsidering the same quantities for WW+jet production in the Tevatron setup, most of the\neffects can be explained by the fact that proton\u2013antiproton collisions take place here instead\nof proton\u2013proton collisions. Besides, the lower CM energy compared to the LHC plays an\nimportant role. We start again with the discussion of transverse-momentum distributions of\nthe hard jet and the decay leptons, and of the missing transverse momentum, which are shown\nin Figure 23. Here, the behaviour of the more exclusive NLO observables can in principle be\nexplained in the same way as for LHC: the LO results overestimate the cross section at high\nscales and underestimate it at low scales due to the fixed renormalization scale used in the\ncalculation. As already observed when considering integrated cross sections, the difference\nbetween the two NLO observables is quite small at the Tevatron, which can be understood\n30\n\n\fd\u001b\nd\u0011\u0016 [fb\u2104\n\nd\u001b\nd\u0011e+ [fb\u2104\n\n20\n\n10\n\n20\n\nLO\n\npp\n\n!\n\nNLO(in l)\n\nNLO(ex l)\n\nNLO(ex l)\n\np\n\npT;jet > 50 GeV\ns = 14 TeV\nW+ ( \u0017e e+ )W ( \u0016 \u0017\u0016\u0016 )+jet+X\n\n!\n\n2\n\n1\n\nLO\n\nNLO(in l)\n\n!\n\n0\n\n1\n\n10\n\npp\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\nNLO\nLO\n\nNLO\nLO\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.75\n\n!\n\np\n\npT;jet > 50 GeV\ns = 14 TeV\nW+ ( \u0017e e+ )W ( \u0016 \u0017\u0016\u0016 )+jet+X\n\n!\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n!\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0.75\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\u0011e+\n\n\u0011\u0016\n\nd\u001b\nd\u0011jet [fb\u2104\n\nd\u001b\ndme+ \u0016\n\nh\n\nfb\nGeV\n\ni\n\n1\n\n10\n\nLO\n\nLO\n\nNLO(in l)\n\nNLO(in l)\n\npp\n0:1\n\nNLO(ex l)\n\nNLO(ex l)\n\n1\n\n4\n\n!\n\np\n\n3\n\n!\n\n2\n\n1\n\np\n\npT;jet > 50 GeV\ns = 14 TeV\npp W+ ( \u0017e e+ )W ( \u0016 \u0017\u0016\u0016 )+jet+X\n\n0:1\n\npT;jet > 50 GeV\ns = 14 TeV\nW+ ( \u0017e e+ )W ( \u0016 \u0017\u0016\u0016 )+jet+X\n\n!\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1.75\n\n!\n\n0\n\n50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n!\n\n!\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n1.5\n\nNLO\nLO\n\nNLO\nLO\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.75\n\n0.75\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n\u0011jet\n\nme+ \u0016 [GeV\u2104\n\nFigure 21: As in Figure 20, but for the pseudo-rapidity \u03b7 of the charged decay leptons (upper\nplots), the pseudo-rapidity of the jet (lower left plot), and the invariant mass of the charged\nleptons (lower right plot).\n\n31\n\n\fd\u001b\nd'e+ \u0016 [fb\u2104\n\nd\u001b\nd os \u0012e+ \u0016 [fb\u2104\n\np !

Therefore, the LO contributions of pp\u0304 \u2192 WW + 2jets + X contained in\nthe more inclusive NLO observable only weaken the effect of negative corrections at large pT ,\nbut do not overcompensate it as for the LHC setup. The pT distributions of the two decay\nleptons are identical up to numerical fluctuations. This results from the fact that the hadronic\nprocess pp\u0304 \u2192 WW + jet + X and the underlying model (SM without CP-violating phases) are\ninvariant under CP transformation. Having not introduced any such CP violating contributions,\nwe thus expect that the final state is also even under CP transformation. Thus, in contrast to\nproton\u2013proton collisions, PDF effects do not cause differences between the pT distributions of\nthe leptons, since the quark PDFs of the proton equal the antiquark PDFs of the antiproton.\nThe distributions of the pseudo-rapidities \u03b7 of the leptons, which are depicted in Figure 24,\nare not symmetric with respect to \u03b7 = 0 due to the asymmetric hadronic initial state. Instead, the\ndistributions of the lepton and the antilepton are identical if one of the distributions is mirrored\naround the \u03b7 = 0 axes. In the Tevatron setup, the positive beam axes corresponds to the direction\nof the proton beam, and the negative axes to the antiproton beam. Correspondingly, positive \u03b7\nvalues describe momenta tending in the direction of the proton beam and vice versa.\nConsidering the non-symmetric pseudo-rapidity distributions, a tendency of the antilepton\nto the positive beam direction and, correspondingly, of the lepton to the negative beam direction\nis evident. To explain this, the argument of t-channel-like emission of W bosons can again be\napplied. As discussed in the LHC case, the W+ boson, and consequently the antilepton, can only\nbe emitted in this way from an up quark or a down antiquark.

In addition, the two dominating partonic contributions\nu\u016b and dd\u0304 to the hadronic cross section are shown.\n\u016bp (p1 )up\u0304 (p2 ) and d\u0304p (p1 )dp\u0304 (p2 ). Due to the effect of t-channel-like W+ emission, the first tends\nto antilepton emission in the positive beam direction, the latter to the negative direction, as\ndepicted in Figure 25. Since the u\u016b channel exceeds the dd\u0304 channel roughly by a factor 4 in\ntotal, a tendency to the positive beam direction results. The same argumentation holds, mutatis\nmutandis, for the lepton and the W\u2212 boson.\nThe pseudo-rapidity of the jet, which is depicted in the lower left plot of Figure 24, is symmetric with respect to \u03b7 = 0. This is due to the fact that no distinction can be made between\nhadronic jets arising from gluons, quarks, or antiquarks. Therefore, the sum over all contributions, which are CP symmetric in pairs, yields a symmetric distribution. As in the case of\nLHC, the dependence of the NLO corrections on the pseudo-rapidities of the jet and the leptons is moderate. Considering the absolute pseudo-rapidity dependence of the cross sections, a\ntendency to events that are not strongly boosted in the direction of the beam axes is observed.\nThis can be understood from the fact that the dominating partonic channels with initial states of\nvalence quark and valence antiquark are not strongly boosted in general.\nThe behaviour of the invariant-mass distribution of the two charged leptons, which is depicted in the lower right plot of Figure 24, can be explained analogously to the LHC case.\nFinally, the angle correlations between the two decay leptons are considered. The angle\nin the transverse plane is again labelled by \u03c6, and \u03b8 is the opening angle between the two\nleptons. The corresponding distributions are depicted in Figure 26. These angle correlations are\nvery important also at Tevatron to distinguish the background process WW+jet from the signal\nprocess H(\u2192 WW\u2217 )+jet. Details on this topic are given in the discussion of the respective LHC\ndistributions. Also in the Tevatron setup, the two leptons tend to fly into opposite directions in\nthe transverse plane. In contrast to the situation at the LHC, this tendency is still observed in the\ncos \u03b8 distribution of the opening angle \u03b8, i.e. the effect is not overcompensated by boost effects.\nThis is again understood from the fact that no tendency to strongly boosted events arises in the\ndominant partonic channels at the Tevatron.\n\n35\n\n\fd\u001b\nd os \u0012e+ \u0016 [fb\u2104\n\nd\u001b\nd'e+ \u0016 [pb\u2104\n10\n\nps!=W1:+96(!TeV\u0017ee+)W (! \u0016\n\np\u0016\np\n\n\u0017\u0016\u0016 )+jet+X\n\np\u0016\np\n10\n\npT;jet > 20 GeV\n\n!

[9], two further groups have performed\nNLO QCD calculations on WW+jet production. The results of one of these groups are given\nin Ref. [10], while those of the second group are not published yet [11]. In Ref. [3], a tuned\ncomparison of the three calculations is provided for the integrated LO cross section, which agree\nagain within statistical errors, and of the virtual corrections at one specific phase-space point.\nThere, the renormalized matrix elements are subdivided into bosonic and fermionic corrections\nwith only the two light generations included in closed quark loops. The results are given in terms\nof the coefficients to the poles \u01eb12 and 1\u01eb , and the finite part, i.e. in a way that is independent of\nthe specific method for cancelling the infrared singularities.4 A comparison of results for the\nthird-generation loops has not been performed so far. Agreement is achieved between the results\nof the three groups at an accuracy level comparable to our internal checks.\n6 Conclusions\nThe production of W-boson pairs in association with a hard jet is an important source for\nbackground to Higgs and new-physics searches both at the Tevatron and at the LHC. A proper\n4 Unfortunately an important detail was not explicitly stated in Ref. [10]: In the dipole subtraction method the\nIR divergences are usually factorized from D-dimenional LO structures (\"conventional dimensional regularization\"). In the comparison shown in Ref. [10], however, absolute numbers on the corrections to the squared matrix\nelements are given where the D-dimenional LO structures are evaluated in four dimensions (without expanding\naround D = 4). This procedure is legitimate, because the same replacement of D-dimensional by four-dimensional\nLO structures is done in the IR-divergent part of the real corrections. The numbers given in Ref. [10] are, thus,\nequivalent to results in the \"'t Hooft\u2013Veltman scheme\" for dimensional regularization where only particles in loops\nor in singular splittings are extended to D dimensions.\n\n36\n\n\ftheoretical prediction for this process requires at least the inclusion of perturbative QCD corrections at the next-to-leading order.\nContinuing previous work, we have described in detail the calculation of these corrections,\nwhich takes into account leptonic decays of the W bosons. To this end, we employ an improved\nnarrow-width approximation that treats the W bosons as on-shell particles, but keeps the Wspin information. While the naive narrow-width approximation, which neglects the information\non the W spins, is only good within 5\u201310% in differential distributions, the improved version\nroughly reaches percent accuracy. This is the result of a comparison of leading-order predictions\nin these two approximations with results of a calculation fully based on off-shell W bosons.\nThe treatment of bottom quarks in the initial or final states deserves particular attention.\nNumerically such contributions only play a significant role if the top-quark propagator present\nin this case becomes resonant. The contributions are thus essentially the off-shell continuations of W+ t\u0304, W\u2212 t, or tt\u0304 production including the subsequent decay of the top-quarks. These\nsubprocesses, however, should not be counted as part of WW+jet production. Therefore, we\nhave excluded contributions from external bottom quarks. The reliability of our procedure has\nbeen verified in a comparison of next-to-leading-order results obtained in two different schemes,\nwhere one is based on four, another on five active quark flavours in the proton.\nOur detailed discussion of numerical results shows that the QCD corrections stabilize the\nleading-order prediction for the WW+jet cross section considerably with respect to a variation\nof the factorization and renormalization scales which we identify with each other. At the LHC,\nthis stabilization of the prediction, however, requires a veto on a second hard jet. Otherwise\nthe production of final states with WW+2jets, which yields a leading-order component of the\nnext-to-leading-order correction, introduces again a large scale dependence. As far as the differential distributions are concerned the corrections are typically of the order of about 25%. For\na remarkable number of distributions the K-factor is only mildly dependent on the kinematical\nregion. At the LHC the \u03b7 distributions in the dominant region and also the distributions in the\nangles between the two charged leptons have an almost constant K-factor of about 1.3 (inclusive cross-section definition); for the exclusive cross-section definition the corrections are even\nsmaller and rather close to 1. The pT spectra, on the other hand, show a much more phasespace-dependent K-factor with the exclusive cross-section definition showing an even larger\ndependence than the inclusive one. This is not surprising since the pT introduces an additional\nscale which could introduce potentially large logarithms which are badly treated by a constant\nrenormalization scale. At the Tevatron our findings are similar. Again the \u03b7 and angular distributions receive corrections in form of an almost constant K-factor of about 1.3 (exclusive\ndefinition). The corrections for the exclusive cross-section definition are again smaller than for\nthe inclusive definition. In case of the pT spectra we observe again a phase-space-dependent\nK-factor. We note that the almost constant K-factor which holds for a remarkable number of\ndistributions has also been observed by Campbell, Ellis and Zanderighi [10].\nThe QCD corrections to the related processes of ZZ+jet and WZ+jet production can be\nobtained in an analogous way as presented here for WW+jet. The corresponding calculations\nare in progress.\n\n37\n\n\fb\n\nk1\n\nf\n\nk2\n\nf \u0304\u2032\n\nk\nV\n\n..\n.\n\na\n\n)\n\nX\n\nFigure 27: Schematic diagram for the process ab \u2192 VX \u2192 f f \u0304\u2032 X.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is supported in part by the European Community's Marie-Curie Research Training Network under contract MRTN-CT-2006-035505 \"Tools and Precision Calculations for\nPhysics Discoveries at Colliders\" and by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through\nSFB-TR 9 \"Computational Theoretical Particle Physics\".

Of course, not only diagrams with a V resonance, as shown in Figure 27, contribute to\nthe full amplitude Mab\u2192VX\u2192 f f \u0304\u2032 X .
