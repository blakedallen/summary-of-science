Discussion\n\n16\n\n1. Introduction\nBlack hole entropy can often be derived in string theory by counting excited states of\nequivalent D-brane configurations. The ensemble of D-brane states with fixed charges\nturns into a classical black hole when the Newton constant is increased. The main point\nof Mathur's 'fuzzball' idea [1] is to ask what happens with the individual (pure) D-brane\nstates in the same process. AdS/CFT suggests that these may become smooth horizonless\ngeometries. This opens up an exciting possibility: if these 'black hole microstate geometries'\ncan be identified and counted, then the black hole entropy can be reproduced directly from\nsupergravity. The goal of this paper is to do exactly this in the 2-charge black hole case,\nfor which the microstate geometries are relatively well understood.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we collect the necessary information\nabout the D1-D5 black hole and its microstates, and formulate our main result. In Section\n3 we review the quantization method based on evaluating the symplectic form. In addition\nto our previous techniques [2, 3], we derive a 'consistency condition' which is a strong\nconstraint on the form of the restricted symplectic form. In the present case, it can be\nused to predict the symplectic form up to a prefactor. To complete the calculation, it is\nsufficient to evaluate the prefactor for perturbations around a conveniently chosen specific\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fspacetime, which we do in Section 4. We conclude in Section 5 with a general discussion\nof the future of Mathur's program.\nNote added. When this paper was being prepared for publication, we received an\ninteresting paper [15] where, among other results, the 'planar curve' part of moduli space\nwas quantized directly (using the method of [2]). Our result agrees with [15], while our\nnew method based on the consistency condition makes the computation somewhat simpler.\n\n2. D1-D5 geometries\n2.1 Fields and charges\nThe D1-D5 black hole microstate geometries are regular solutions of Type IIB SUGRA.\nThe nontrivial fields (the metric, the dilaton, and the RR two-form) are given by [4, 5]\nds2 = e\u2212\u03a6/2 ds2string ,\np\n\u0003 p\n1 \u0002\n\u2212(dt + A)2 + (dy + B)2 + f1 f5 dx2 + f1 /f5 dz2 ,\nds2string = \u221a\nf1 f5\ne2\u03a6 = f1 /f5 ,\n1\n(dt + A) \u2227 (dy + B) + C ,\nC=\nf1\ndB = \u22174 dA ,\nf5 = 1 +\n\nQ5\nL\n\nZ\n\n0\n\ndC = \u2212 \u22174 df5 ,\n\nL\n\n(2.1)\n\nds\n,\n|x \u2212 F(s)|2\n\nZ\nQ5 L |F\u2032 (s)|2 ds\n,\nf1 = 1 +\nL 0 |x \u2212 F(s)|2\nZ\nQ5 L Fi (s) ds\nA=\ndxi .\nL 0 |x \u2212 F(s)|2\nThe solutions are asymptotically M 5 \u00d7 S 1 \u00d7 T 4 ; y and z denote the S 1 and T 4 directions.\nThe moduli space is parametrized by a closed curve\nxi = Fi (s) (0 < s < L, i = 1 . . . 4),\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhich is assumed to be smooth and non-selfintersecting. Its parameter length has to satisfy\nL=\n\n2\u03c0Q5\n,\nR\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere R is the coordinate radius of S 1 . Under these conditions the above geometries are\ncompletely regular. It should be noted that this description is somewhat redundant, since\na constant shift of parameter s \u2192 s+h would produce the same geometry; this redundancy\nwill play a role below.\nIn Mathur's approach to black hole microstates [1], solutions (2.1) are supposed to\nrepresent microstates of the spherically symmetric 2-charge geometry, which is given by\nEqs. (2.1) if we replace\nQ1,5\n, Ai , Bi \u2192 0 .\n(2.4)\nf1,5 \u2192 1 +\n|x|2\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fThis system is equivalent to M 5 \u00d7 S 1 \u00d7 T 4 with N1 D1-branes wrapping S 1 and N5 D5\nbranes wrapping the full S 1 \u00d7 T 4 . The brane numbers are related to the charges by\nQ5 = gs N5 ,\n\nQ1 =\n\ngs\nN1\nV4\n\n(2.5)\n\n(in the units \u03b1\u2032 = 1), where gs is the string coupling and (2\u03c0)4 V4 is the coordinate volume\nof T 4 . The D1-D5 system is known to have the macroscopic entropy1\np\nS = 2\u03c0 2N1 N5 .\n(2.6)\nThis entropy was not yet reproduced as a thermodynamic Bekenstein-Hawking entropy,\nbecause the spherically symmetric geometry has a classical horizon of zero area. A nonzero\nhorizon is expected to appear once higher-curvature corrections to the two-derivative Type\nIIB SUGRA are included, similar to how it happens in the heterotic compactifications [7].\n2.2 Counting D1-D5 microstates\nIn this paper we will reproduce (a finite fraction of) the entropy (2.6) by counting microstate\ngeometries (2.1). To do this, we will have to quantize the curve F(s) (see footnote 3 in\n[5]). As we will show, in quantum theory F(s) acquires commutation relations:\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\nFi (s), Fj\u2032 (s\u0303) = i\u03c0\u03bc2 \u03b4ij \u03b4(s \u2212 s\u0303) .\n\n(2.7)\n\nThis commutation relation has been previously conjectured by using the fact that the D1D5 system can be U-dualized into the FP system (the multiply wound fundamental string\ncarrying momentum along a compactified direction). The curve F(s) in the D1-D5 picture\nwas identified with the profile of a chiral excitation of the dual string according to a simple\nproportionality relation\ngs\n(2.8)\nF(s) = \u03bcFFP (s),\n\u03bc= \u221a .\nR V4\nThe fundamental string is quantized using the quadratic action\nZ\n1\n(\u1e8ai2 \u2212 Xi\u20322 )d\u03c4 d\u03c3 ,\n4\u03c0\n\n(2.9)\n\nand thus satisfies the commutation relation\n[Xi (\u03c3), \u1e8ai (\u03c3\u0303)] = i2\u03c0\u03b4(\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3\u0303)\u03b4ij .\n\n(2.10)\n\nThe commutator of its chiral component is 1/2 of that:\n\u2032\n[FFPi (s), FFPj\n(s\u0303)] = i\u03c0\u03b4ij \u03b4(s \u2212 s\u0303) ,\n\n(2.11)\n\nand (2.7) follows.\nLater in this paper we will show how, instead of such duality-based reasoning, one can\nderive (2.7) directly from the SUGRA action. At this point let us demonstrate how this\n1\n\nSee [6] for a derivation of this entropy by using the Dirac-Born-Infeld effective action to quantize\nsupertubes.\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fresult can be used to compute the degeneracy of the D1-D5 system. From the SUGRA\npoint of view, we must count the number of microstate geometries with fixed charges Q1,5 ,\nwhich translates into counting the number of curves F(s) satisfying the relation\nQ5\nQ1 =\nL\n\nZ\n\nL\n0\n\n|F\u2032 (s)|2 ds .\n\n(2.12)\n\nClassically, this question cannot be answered - there are infinitely many such curves.\nHowever, once we take the commutator (2.7) into account, we should expand F(s) into\nquantum oscillators:\nF(s) = \u03bc\n\n\u221e\n\u0011\nX\n2\u03c0k\n1 \u0010 i 2\u03c0k s\n\u221a\nck e L + c\u2020k e\u2212i L s ,\n2k\nk=1\n\nij\n\u2032\n[cik , cj\u2020\nk \u2032 ] = \u03b4 \u03b4kk ,\n\u001d\n\u001cZ L\n(2\u03c0)2 2\n\u2032\n2\n\u03bc Nosc ,\n: |F (s)| : ds =\nL\n0\n\u221e\nX\nNosc =\nkhc\u2020k ck i ,\n\n(2.13)\n\nk=1\n\nIn such a quantum theory relation (2.12) takes the form\nN1 N5 = Nosc .\n\n(2.14)\n\nThus the degeneracy of states is equal to the degeneracy of the N1 N5 energy level in the\nsystem of 4 chiral bosons:\n\u0012 r\n\u0013\nc\nN1 N5 , c = 4 .\n\u0393 \u223c exp 2\u03c0\n(2.15)\n6\nIt follows that the microstate geometries (2.1) account for a finite fraction of the full D1-D5\nentropy. It is well known that they are insufficient to recover the full entropy: one would\nhave to consider solutions corresponding to the string vibrating in the T 4 directions [5] and\nto the fermionic excitations of the string (see [8]).\n\n3. Quantization from SUGRA\n3.1 Symplectic form quantization\nWe would now like to derive the commutation relation (2.7) directly from SUGRA. There\nare several reasons why such a result would be welcome. First, it is important to know as\na matter of principle that the commutators can be extracted from the classical geometries\nwithout any further input. Second, the U-duality-based derivation of (2.7) described above\nis not fully satisfactory: 1) it may not be easily generalizable to 3-charge microstate geometries which seem to have a very complicated moduli space parametrized by 4-dimensional\nhyper-Kaehler metrics [9]; 2) strictly speaking, the shape of the curve is not guaranteed to\nbe a duality-invariant notion (only the degeneracies of states are).\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fNotice that we expect nontrivial commutation relations (2.7) to appear already among\nthe functions parametrizing the moduli space. This situation should be contrasted with the\ncase of Manton's soliton scattering, where positions of solitons by themselves commute, and\nto get nontrivial quantization one has to augment the phase space by adding momenta,\ncorresponding to slow soliton motion. This difference can be traced to the stationary, as\nopposed to static, nature of our solutions.\nThe standard approach to quantization would be to work with the quadratic action for\nsmall fluctuations around every point in the moduli space. However, this is not technically\nfeasible, since for a general geometry (2.1) there does not seem to be a convenient basis at\nhand into which to expand these small fluctuations. Another problem is that, typically, the\nquadratic action would couple fluctuations along moduli space to fluctuations orthogonal\nto it. This indicates that quantizing the quadratic action is a more difficult problem than\nthe one we have to solve.\nAll these difficulties were explained in [2, 3], where it was proposed that instead of the\nquadratic action, it is more efficient to think directly in terms of the classical equivalent\nof the commutation relations - the Poisson brackets. In a general formulation of the\nproblem we are given a classical dynamical system with phase space coordinates having\nthe standard Poisson brackets\n{q I , pJ } = \u03b4IJ .\n(3.1)\nWe are also given a subspace M of the full phase space parametrized by some coordinates\nxA :\nq = q(x), p = p(x) .\n(3.2)\nThe problem is to find the induced Poisson brackets: {xA , xB } =? To solve the problem\nlet us consider the symplectic form of the theory:\n\u03a9 = dpI \u2227 dq I .\n\n(3.3)\n\nThe symplectic structure on M is given by the pull-back (i.e. restriction) of \u03a9:\n\u03a9|M = \u03c9AB (x)dxA \u2227 dxB ,\n\u03c9AB =\n\n\u2202pI \u2202q I\n.\n\u2202x[A \u2202xB]\n\n(3.4)\n\nThe induced Poisson brackets are simply given by the inverse of \u03c9AB :\n1\n{xA , xB } = \u03c9 AB .\n2\n\n(3.5)\n\nThis argument shows why it is convenient to think in terms of the symplectic form: it\nencodes the Poisson brackets in a covariant way.\nIn our particular situation the phase space will be that of Type IIB SUGRA, the\nsubspace M being the moduli space of D1-D5 geometries parametrized by closed curves.\nThe Einstein-frame action of Type IIB SUGRA in the relevant sector is given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n\u221a\n1\n1 \u03a6\n1\n2\n2\n\u2212g R \u2212 (\u2202\u03a6) \u2212 e |F3 | , F3 = dC .\n(3.6)\nSIIB =\n(2\u03c0)7 gs2\n2\n2\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fTo define the phase space variables, we put the theory in the Hamiltonian form. Dynamical\ndegrees of freedom on a surface of constant time will be given by the spatial components\nof the metric and of the two-form, as well as by the value of the dilaton:\nq = {gab , Cab , \u03a6} .\n\n(3.7)\n\nThe remaining components of the metric and of the two-form (gtt , gta , Cta ) will appear in\nthe action only as Lagrange multipliers, i.e. without time derivatives. The symplectic form\nof the theory is given by\nZ\nX\n\u2202L\nd9 x\n\u03b4\u03a0q (x, t) \u2227 \u03b4q(x, t), \u03a0q =\n\u03a9=\n.\n(3.8)\n\u2202 q\u0307\nt=const\nq\nHere \u03b4 denotes the differential in the space of fields, not to be confused with the spacetime\ndifferential dx\u03bc . This equation can be rewritten in the Crnkovi\u0107-Witten-Zuckerman [10, 11]\ncovariant formalism as an integral over a Cauchy surface \u03a3 of the symplectic current:\nZ\n\u03a9 = d\u03a3\u03bc J \u03bc ,\n(3.9)\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202L\nJ\u03bc = \u03b4\n\u2227 \u03b4\u03c8A .\n(3.10)\n\u2202\u2202\u03bc \u03c8A\nHere \u03c8A runs over all the fields of the theory. If we choose \u03a3 = {t = const}, the contributions of Lagrange multipliers drop out, and we recover (3.8). The symplectic current J \u03bc\nhas several useful properties: 1) it is conserved as a consequence of the classical equations\nof motion (and thus \u03a9 is independent of the choice of the Cauchy surface), it changes by a\ntotal derivative under a gauge transformation (and thus \u03a9 is gauge invariant). Moreover,\nboth J \u03bc and \u03a9 are invariant under point transformations of the elementary fields.\nThe symplectic form of the relevant sector of Type IIB SUGRA can be written as\nZ\n1\nd\u03a3\u03bc J \u03bc ,\n\u03a9=\n(2\u03c0)7 gs2\nJ \u03bc = Jg\u03bc + JF\u03bc + J\u03a6\u03bc .\n\n(3.11)\n\nThe three terms here are the gravity, two-form, and dilaton symplectic currents, which can\nbe computed using Eq. (3.10) from the corresponding parts of the action (3.6). We have\n\u221a\n\u221a\nJg\u03bc = \u2212\u03b4\u0393\u03bc\u03b1\u03b2 \u2227 \u03b4( \u2212gg\u03b1\u03b2 ) + \u03b4\u0393\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2 \u2227 \u03b4( \u2212gg \u03bc\u03b1 ) ,\n\u0011\n\u0010\u221a\nJF\u03bc = \u2212\u03b4\n\u2212ge\u2212\u03a6 F \u03bc|\u03b1\u03b2| \u2227 \u03b4C|\u03b1\u03b2| ,\n\u0001\n\u221a\nJ\u03a6\u03bc = \u2212\u03b4 \u2212g\u2202 \u03bc \u03a6 \u2227 \u03b4\u03a6 .\n\n(3.12)\n(3.13)\n(3.14)\n\nThe Jg\u03bc is known as the Crnkovi\u0107-Witten current [10]. When deriving it from the gravitational action, one should use the so-called \u0393\u0393 \u2212 \u0393\u0393 Lagrangian, which contains only the\nfirst derivatives of the metric and differs from the standard Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian by\na total derivative term.\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\f3.2 Consistency condition\nThe above logic has been laid out in [2, 3], where it was used to quantize the moduli space\nof the 'bubbling AdS' geometries [12]. It can be used to compute the symplectic form\non any subspace of the full phase space of gravity. Now we will add a new ingredient to\nthe discussion. Namely, we observe that the subspace we are dealing with is not just any\nsubspace: it is rather special in that it consists of time-independent solutions. It turns\nout that in this case there is an additional piece of information which can simplify the\nderivation of the restricted symplectic form. In particular, this information will allow us\nto predict the resulting symplectic form up to a coefficient, without doing any difficult\ncomputations.\nIn fact, the idea we are about to explain applies to any subspace M which is invariant\nunder the Hamiltonian evolution. Thus we consider a general Hamiltonian system (H, \u03a9)\nwith a Hamiltonian H and a symplectic form \u03a9. Let us restrict \u03a9 and H to M:\n\u03c9 = \u03a9|M ,\n\nh = H|M .\n\n(3.15)\n\nNow we have two hamiltonian flows on M: the original flow (H, \u03a9), which leaves M\ninvariant by assumption, as well as the flow (h, \u03c9) generated by the restricted objects.\nTheorem (Consistency condition): These flows are equivalent on M: (H,\u03a9)\u2261\n(h, \u03c9).\nThe proof is very simple. The solutions of the Hamilton equations can be obtained in\nthe first-order formalism as stationary curves of the functional\nZ\nh\ni\ndt Ki (X)\u1e8a i \u2212 H(X) ,\n(3.16)\nwhere K is a one-form such that \u03a9 = dK. Restricting \u03a9 to M is equivalent to restricting\nK. A stationarity curve will of course remain stationary under a smaller class of variations\nwhich do not take the curve outside M. It follows that any curve of the flow (H, \u03a9) must\nsatisfy equations of motion of (h, \u03c9). Q.E.D.\nTo apply this theorem in practice, we must evaluate the on-shell Hamiltonian (i.e. the\nsolution energy) H|M as a functional on the moduli space. From the form of this functional\nwe get a consistency condition which should be satisfied by \u03c9: the Hamiltonian equations\nderived from H|M and \u03c9 should coincide with the evolution on the moduli space implied\nby the form of the solutions.\nThe energy of the D1-D5 microstate geometries is given by\nH|M\n\nRV4\n= 2\ngs\n\n\u0012\n\nQ5\nL\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nL\n\n\u2032\n\n2\n\n|F (s)| ds + Q5\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(3.17)\n\nIt can be evaluated using the standard general relativity formula for the asymptotically\nflat spacetimes\n\u0013\nZ \u0012\n1\n\u2202gab\n\u2202gbb\nH=\n\u2212\nna\n(3.18)\n(2\u03c0)7 gs2 \u2202\u03a3 \u2202xb\n\u2202xa\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fwhere \u2202\u03a3 is the asymptotic boundary, which in our case is S 1 \u00d7 T 4 times the 3-sphere at\nlarge |x|, gab is the spatial metric (i.e. a, b run over the coordinates x, y, z), and na is the\noutside unit normal to \u03a3. Notice that (3.17) agrees with the total mass of the D-branes:\nEtot = gs\u22121 (N1 R + N5 RV4 ) .\nThe consistency condition implies that the Poisson brackets on the moduli space should\nbe such that the Hamilton equation\ndFi\n= {Fi , H|M }\ndt\n\n(3.19)\n\nbe compatible with the time-independence of the microstate geometries. A moment's\nthought shows that the only nontrivial allowed equation is\ndFi\ndFi\n= const.\n,\ndt\nds\n\n(3.20)\n\nFi (s, t) = Fi (s + const.t) .\n\n(3.21)\n\nso that\nSuch, and only such, dynamics leads to time-independent geometries, since the metric and\nother fields are given in terms of contour integrals which remain unchanged under the\nconstant shift of parameter (3.21).\nThe Hamiltonian (3.17) leads to Eq. (3.20) if and only if the Poisson brackets have the\nform:\n{Fi (s), Fj\u2032 (s\u0303)} = \u03b1 \u03b4ij \u03b4(s \u2212 s\u0303) ,\n(3.22)\nwhere \u03b1 is a constant. The corresponding symplectic form is thus fixed up to a proportionality coefficient2 :\nZ\n1\n(3.23)\n\u03b4Fi\u2032 (s) \u2227 \u03b4Fi (s) ds .\n\u03a9=\n2\u03b1\nNotice that the precise value of \u03b1 cannot be established by this argument - it will\nhave to be found by an explicit calculation. Notice also that \u03b1, although a constant for\neach F(s), could in principle depend on F(s) by being a function of integrals of motion\n(e.g. of the Hamiltonian or higher-derivative contour integrals):\n\u0013\n\u0012Z\nZ\nZ\n\u20322\n\u2032\u20322\n2\n\u03b1=\u03b1\nF ds, F ds, K(s \u2212 s\u0303)|F(s) \u2212 F(s\u0303)| dsds\u0303, . . . .\n(3.24)\nThe only requirement is that it should be invariant under the shifts of parameter F(s) \u2192\nF(s+h). Thus the calculation also has to establish that \u03b1 is a numerical constant, and more\nprecisely that \u03b1 = \u03c0\u03bc2 . In this case the Poisson bracket (3.22) promotes upon quantization\nto precisely the conjectured commutator (2.7).\n2\n\nNotice that this symplectic form is invariant under the infinitesimal transformation \u03b4F(s) \u2192 \u03b4F(s) +\n\u01ebF (s). Thus it restricts nicely to the 'true' moduli space which is the space of curves modulo constant\nparameter shifts. In fact the whole above discussion could be phrased, completely equivalently, in terms of\nthis 'true' moduli space.\n\u2032\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fTo conclude this section, we would like to note that in the 'bubbling AdS' case mentioned above, where the symplectic form was computed using the direct CWZ method in\n[2, 3], the consistency condition turns out to be much more powerful and in fact fixes the\nsymplectic form completely, i.e. together with the prefactor. The reason is that in the 'bubbling AdS' case there is non-trivial dynamics on the moduli space of geometries, namely\nthe planar droplets parametrizing it rotate with a particular angular velocity, which can be\nfixed unambiguously by requiring that the metric take the asymptotically AdS form with\nall perturbations going to zero at the prescribed rate3 .\n\n4. Fixing the prefactor\n4.1 Simplifying assumptions\nIn the previous section we used the consistency condition to show that the time-independence\nof the D1-D5 solutions together with the form that the Hamiltonian takes on the moduli\nspace leave very little freedom for the restricted symplectic form: it must be given by\nEq. (3.23), and the only thing that remains is to evaluate the coefficient \u03b1. This is quite\na strong restriction, since the most general expression for the symplectic form respecting\nthe translation invariance in the parameter space is\nZ\n\u03a9general = ds ds\u0303 Kij (s \u2212 s\u0303|F) \u03b4Fi (s) \u2227 \u03b4Fj (s\u0303) ,\n(4.1)\nwhere the symplectic kernel K has to be antisymmetric:\nKij (s|F) = \u2212Kji (\u2212s|F) .\n\n(4.2)\n\nSome extra restrictions could be generally derived using the invariance of \u03a9 under the\nPoincar\u00e9 group acting on the curve, but these restrictions would fall far short of what we\nhave established: that the kernel is diagonal in the perturbations and, most importantly,\nthat it is local:\n1\nKij =\n\u03b4ij \u03b4\u2032 (s) .\n(4.3)\n2\u03b1(F)\nAlthough an explicit calculation will be necessary to determine \u03b1, it turns out that what\nwe already know will allow us to organize this calculation in a rather economical way.\nRather than evaluating the symplectic form in full generality, as it was done in [2] for\nthe 'bubbling AdS' case, the idea is to find a case which is simple yet restrictive enough\nso that it fixes the remaining freedom. We will consider the following set of simplifying\nassumptions : 1) the curve contains a straight-line interval I of the form (see Fig. 1):\nF1 (s) = s,\n\nF2,3,4 (s) = 0 (0 < s < 1) ;\n\n(4.4)\n\n2) the only nonzero component is\n\u03b4F2 (s) \u2261 a(s) (0 < s < 1) .\n3\n\n(4.5)\n\nThe question whether it is possible to make such an argument was first posed to me by Boris Pioline.\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fFigure 1: The class of closed curves containing a unit interval I along x1 , and otherwise having\nan arbitrary profile. We evaluate the symplectic form around any curve from this class, and for the\nperturbations supported on I and directed along x2 . This symplectic form is then extended to the\nfull moduli space by uniqueness.\n\nUnder these assumptions, we will show that the symplectic form is given by\nZ\n1\n\u03a9=\na\u2032 (s) \u2227 a(s) ds .\n2\u03c0\u03bc2\n\n(4.6)\n\nindependently of the shape that the curve takes outside I. A moment's thought shows that\nthis is enough to rule out any nontrivial dependence of the kind (3.24). In other words, the\nonly possible expression of the form (3.23),(3.24) which reduces to (4.6) under the above\nsimplifying assumptions is the one where \u03b1 = \u03c0\u03bc2 is a numerical constant independent of\nF(s).\n4.2 Field perturbations\nHaving assumed (4.4),(4.5), let us begin the evaluation of the symplectic form. First of all\nwe have to compute perturbations of the fields f1,5 , A, B, C in (2.1). It will be convenient\nto introduce the polar coordinates in the space transverse to I:\ndx2i = dx21 + dr 2 + r 2 (d\u03b8 2 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 ),\nq\nr \u2261 x22 + x23 + x24 , x2 = r cos \u03b8 .\nStarting with f5 , we can write its perturbed value as follows:\nZ\nds\nQ5 \u221e\n \u0304\nf5 (F + \u03b4F) = f5 +\n2\nL \u2212\u221e (x1 \u2212 s) + (x2 \u2212 a(s))2 + x23 + x24\nZ\n\u03c0Q5 Q5 \u221e\n2x2 a(s) ds\n,\n\u2248 f \u03045 +\n+\nLr\nL \u2212\u221e [(x1 \u2212 s)2 + r 2 ]2\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\nQ\n1\n1\n5\nf \u03045 \u2261 1 +\nds\n\u2212\n,\nL s\u2208I\n|x \u2212 F(s)|2 (x1 \u2212 s)2 + r 2\n/\n\n(4.7)\n\n(4.8)\n(4.9)\n\nwhere \u2248 means that we expanded to the first order in a(s). The f \u03045 is the regular part\nof f5 (i.e. it has no singularities on I); it does not vary with a(s). Using the momentum\nrepresentation for the convolution integral, we have\nf5 \u2248 f \u03045 + \u03b3f sing ,\ni\u2228\n1 cos \u03b8 h\n(1 + r|p|) e\u2212r|p| \u00e3(p) ,\nf sing \u2261 + 2\nr\nr\nR\n\u03c0Q5\n= .\n\u03b3\u2261\nL\n2\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n(4.10)\n(4.11)\n\n\fHere we introduced the notation for the Fourier transform in x1 and its inverse:\nZ\nh\ni\u2228 Z dp\n\u00e3(p) \u2261 ds eips a(s),\nb(x) = b\u0303(p) \u2261\ne\u2212ipx1 b\u0303(p) .\n2\u03c0\nAnalogously we get\nf1 \u2248 f \u03041 + \u03b3f\n\nsing\n\n,\n\n(4.12)\n\ni\u2228\nsing\ncos \u03b8 h \u2212r|p|\nA \u2248 \u0100 + \u03b3f dx1 \u2212 \u03b3\nipe\n\u00e3(p) dx2 ,\nr\n\n(4.13)\n\nwhere the barred fields, whose precise form will not be needed below, are again regular on\nI. The B and C are then found by solving the flat-space Hodge dual equations in (2.1):\n\u001a\ni\u2228 \u001b\nsin2 \u03b8 h\nB \u2248 B\u0304 + \u03b3 1 \u2212 cos \u03b8 +\n(1 + r|p|) e\u2212r|p| \u00e3(p)\nd\u03c6 ,\n(4.14)\nr\n\u001a\ni\u2228 \u001b\n2 h\nsin\n\u03b8\n\u2212r|p|\ne\n\u00e3(p)\ndx1 \u2227 d\u03c6\nC \u2248 C \u0304 + \u03b3 \u22121 + cos \u03b8 \u2212\nr\nh\ni\u2228\n+ \u03b3 cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8 (i sign p) e\u2212r|p| (2 + r|p|) \u00e3(p) d\u03b8 \u2227 d\u03c6 .\n(4.15)\n4.3 A coordinate transformation\nIf we substitute (4.10)-(4.15) into (2.1) and expand in a(s), we will find what we call 'naive'\nperturbations of g\u03bc\u03bd , C\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a6. Schematically we have:\nnaive\n\u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd\n= g\u03bc\u03bd (F + \u03b4F) \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd (F)\n\n(4.16)\n\nexpanded to the first order in \u03b4F, with analogous expressions for \u03a6 and C. These perturbations will not yet be suitable for computing the symplectic form using Eq. (3.11). The\nreason is that \u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd so defined will be singular on the curve in the coordinate system in\nwhich g\u03bc\u03bd is regular. A manifestation of this singularity is that the O(a(s)) terms in (4.10)(4.15) are all more singular as r \u2192 0 than the zero-order terms. The correct definition for\nthe field perturbations is ([2])\n(\u03b5)\n\u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd = g\u03bc\u03bd\n(F + \u03b4F) \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd (F) ,\n\n(4.17)\n\nwhere an appropriate change of coordinates x\u03bc \u2192 x\u03bc \u2212 \u03b5\u03bc has to be applied to g\u03bc\u03bd (F + \u03b4F)\nbefore the subtraction is made. The effect of this can be expressed as\nnaive\n\u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd\n+ \u03b5\u03bb g\u03bc\u03bd,\u03bb + 2\u03b5\u03bb,(\u03bc g\u03bd)\u03bb ,\n\n(4.18)\n\nwhere the additional terms (which can also be written as \u2207(\u03bc \u03b5\u03bd) ) are the effect of an O(a)\ncoordinate transformation. They have to be chosen so that the resulting \u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd be regular.\nAnalogously we will have\n\u03b4\u03a6 = \u03b4\u03a6naive + \u03b5\u03bb \u03a6 ,\u03bb ,\n\u03b4C\u03bc\u03bd =\n\nnaive\n\u03b4C\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u03bb\n\n+ \u03b5 C\u03bc\u03bd,\u03bb +\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n(4.19)\n2\u03b5\u03bb,(\u03bc C\u03bd)\u03bb\n\n+ \u039b[\u03bc,\u03bd] ,\n\n(4.20)\n\n\fFigure 2: The 'cutoff' C \u221e function \u03c7(r) interpolates smoothly between 1 at r = 0 and 0 at r = \u221e.\n\nwhere in the case of the two-form field we also have to include the effect of an abelian\ngauge transformation.\nIt is not difficult to guess the form of a coordinate transformation x \u2192 x\u0303 needed to\nmake the field perturbations regular. The effect of this transformation should be such that\n1) the perturbed curve x2 = a(x1 ) has equation x\u03032 = 0 in the new coordinates; 2) the\ntransformation has unit Jacobian on the curve; 3) the transformation tends to the identity\ntransformation at infinity. The following transformation satisfies all these requirements\nand will do the job:\nx\u03031 = x1 + a\u2032 (x1 )x2 \u03c7(r) ,\nx\u03032 = x2 \u2212 a(x1 )\u03c7(r) .\n\n(4.21)\n\nHere \u03c7(r) is any function which interpolates smoothly between 1 at r = 0 and 0 at r = \u221e\n(see Fig. 2). Thus the only nonzero components of \u03b5\u03bc are\n\u03b51 = \u2212a\u2032 (x1 )x2 \u03c7(r),\n\n\u03b52 = a(x1 )\u03c7(r) .\n\n(4.22)\n\n4.4 Reduction to the plane wave\nImplementing this coordinate transformation, we will get regular field variations, which\ncould in principle be used to compute the symplectic form using Eq (3.11). Note that\nthe barred terms in (4.10)-(4.15) will 'contaminate' the field variations as a consequence\nof expansions that will have to be done once (4.10)-(4.15) is substituted into (2.1), and\nlater via the second terms in (4.18)-(4.20). However, we claim that all these contaminating\ncontributions can be ignored. More precisely, we would like to argue that the symplectic\nform can be computed by putting all the barred terms to zero both in the unperturbed\nspacetime and in the perturbations.\nThe argument why this is so consists of three steps. First of all, we notice that to\ndetermine the local contribution to the symplectic current, it is enough to perform the\nintegration in (3.9) in a small neighborhood of I, which should include the regions where\n\u03c7 6= 0. The reason is that outside of this neighborhood the field perturbations depend on\na(s) in a regular nonlocal way. Thus the same will be true of the symplectic current, and\nupon integration this region can only give a nonlocal contribution to the symplectic form.\nSuch a contribution cannot affect the coefficient in front of the local symplectic kernel (4.3),\nwhich we have to determine.\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fSecond, once we have limited ourselves to a small neighborhood of I, in this region we\ncan expand the barred fields in the transverse space. Schematically we can write:\nf \u0304 = f \u0304|r=0 + xi\u22a5 \u2202i f \u0304|r=0 + . . . ,\n\nxi\u22a5 = (x2 , x3 , x4 ) ,\n\n(4.23)\n\nwhere f \u0304 stands for any of the barred fields that we encountered. The coefficients in this\nseries are fields of x1 = s only. Now, it is easy to check that the metric and the perturbations\nwill depend on these coefficients analytically near I. In particular, the limit when all the\nbarred fields tend to zero is completely well behaved. Away from this limit, the coefficients\nof (4.23), say f \u0304(s), will enter the field perturbations as functions multiplying a(s), a\u2032 (s),\nor general convolution integrals of the form\n\u0012 \u0013\nZ\ns\u0303\na(s \u2212 s\u0303)\u03a8\nds\u0303 ,\n(4.24)\nr\nevaluated at the same point s. It means that after integration, these coefficients may make\ntheir way into the symplectic form only via terms involving products f \u0304(s)a(s) and such.\nAs a third, final, step, we notice that there is a lot of freedom to deform the curve\noutside I to make the barred fields into functions varying nontrivially along and near I.\nThis can be seen by examining the explicit expression (4.9) for f \u03045 and analogous expressions\nfor the other fields. However, for varying f \u0304, the terms involving products like f \u0304(s)a(s)\nwould not be consistent with the translationally invariant nature of the symplectic kernel\n(4.3). This means that such terms simply cannot appear, which finishes the argument.\nPutting the barred fields to zero means that we pass from the closed curve to an infinite\nstraight line and also drop the 1's from f1,5 . The resulting nonperturbed geometry is a\nplane wave. In other words we proved that to find the general symplectic form it is enough\nto find the symplectic form around the plane wave.\n4.5 Plane wave symplectic form\nIn this subsection we evaluate the symplectic form for perturbations around the plane\nwave, which corresponds to putting all the barred fields in (4.10)-(4.15) to zero. At this\npoint bulky computations are unavoidable, however they lend themselves easily to automatization. The reader may want to skip to the main results: the gravitational and the\ntwo-form symplectic current integrals (4.33),(4.38), and the symplectic form (4.39),(4.40)\nwhich agrees with (4.6). According to the arguments of the preceding subsections, this completes the proof that the symplectic form on the full moduli space is given by Eq. (3.23)\nwith the right prefactor.\nNotice that once we dropped the barred fields we have f1 = f5 to the first order in a.\nThis means that the dilaton stays constant: \u03a6 = 1, \u03b4\u03a6 = 0. The difference between the\nEinstein and string frame disappears. Also the T 4 part of the metric becomes trivial and\njust contributes a volume factor to the symplectic form upon integration. The unperturbed\n6d metric is:\n\u0014\n\u0015\nr 2\n\u03b3 2\ndy 2\n2\n2\n2\nds = \u2212 dt \u2212 dt dx1 + dr + r \u03b3d\u03b8 + 2(1 \u2212 cos \u03b8)(\u03b3d\u03c6 \u2212 d\u03c6 dy) +\n. (4.25)\n\u03b3\nr\n\u03b3\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\f\u221a\nThe radial part of the metric becomes regular in the variable \u03c1 = r. To see that the\nangular part is regular, one should notice that near \u03b8 = \u03c0 the (\u03c6, y) part rewrites neatly\nas \u03b3(2d\u03c6 + \u03b3 \u22121 dy)2 . In fact the metric of the transverse space can be brought to the flat\nR4 form, but we will find it convenient to keep working in the current coordinate system.\nThe pertubartions of the 6d metric after the coordinate transformation (4.21) become\ne is equal \u00e3(p) times the coefficient given in the table):\n(the Fourier transform \u03b4g\n\u03bc\u03bd\ntt :\n\ni\ncos \u03b8 h\n(1 + r|p|)e\u2212r|p| \u2212 \u03c7\n\u03b3\n\ntx1 : \u2212 cos \u03b8 r\u03c7 p2\n\u0011\n\u0010\ntr : cos \u03b8 e\u2212r|p| \u2212 \u03c7 \u2212 r\u03c7\u2032 ip\n\u0010\n\u0011\nt\u03b8 : \u2212 sin \u03b8 r e\u2212r|p| \u2212 \u03c7 ip\n\u0011\n\u03b3 cos \u03b8 \u0010 \u2212r|p|\nx1 r :\ne\n\u2212 \u03c7 ip\nr\n\u0010\n\u0011\nx1 \u03b8 : \u2212\u03b3 sin \u03b8 e\u2212r|p| \u2212 \u03c7 ip\ni\n\u03b3 cos \u03b8 h\n\u2212r|p|\n\u2032\n(1\n+\nr|p|)e\n\u2212\n\u03c7\n+\n2r\u03c7\nrr :\nr2\nr\u03b8 : \u2212\u03b3 sin \u03b8 \u03c7\u2032\nh\ni\n\u2212r|p|\n\u03b8\u03b8 : \u03b3 cos \u03b8 (1 + r|p|)e\n\u2212\u03c7\nh\ni\n\u03c6\u03c6 : 2\u03b3(1 \u2212 cos \u03b8) (1 + r|p|)e\u2212r|p| \u2212 \u03c7\nh\ni\n\u03c6y : (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8) (1 + r|p|)e\u2212r|p| \u2212 \u03c7\ni\ncos \u03b8 h\n(1 + r|p|)e\u2212r|p| \u2212 \u03c7\nyy : \u2212\n\u03b3\n\n(4.26)\n\nWe see the effect that the presence of \u03c7 has on the regularity on the field perturbations: it\nsmoothens the behavior at r = 0 by subtracting the leading singularity. A quick check of\nthe regularity at \u03b8 = \u03c0 for all r can be performed by noticing that the perturbation near\nthe south pole can be written as\nh\ni\n\u03b3(2d\u03c6 + \u03b3 \u22121 dy)2 (1 + r|p|)e\u2212r|p| \u2212 \u03c7 .\n\n(4.27)\n\nTo compute the symplectic form, we choose the Cauchy surface \u03a3 = {t = const}, so that the\nonly necessary symplectic current component is J t .

However, in the problem at hand such a change\nis unnecessary. We simply compute the two-form perturbations using (4.10)-(4.15) in (2.1)\n(with all the barred fields put to zero) and applying the coordinate change (4.21). They\nstill come out singular near the south pole.

After that the two-form perturbations become (the Fourier transforms\nof the corresponding components are equal \u00e3(p) times the coefficient in the table):\nh\ni\ndt \u2227 d\u03c6 : (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8) (1 + r|p|) e\u2212r|p| \u2212 \u03c7\ndx1 \u2227 d\u03c6 : \u03b3 sin2 \u03b8 e\u2212r|p| |p|\n\ndr \u2227 d\u03c6 : \u03b3(cos2 \u03b8 \u2212 cos \u03b8)e\u2212r|p|ip\n\nd\u03b8 \u2227 d\u03c6 : \u03b3 sin \u03b8(r|p| + 2 cos \u03b8)e\u2212r|p|i sign p\ni\ncos \u03b8 h\n(1 + r|p|) e\u2212r|p| \u2212 \u03c7\ndt \u2227 dy : \u2212\n\u03b3\ndr \u2227 dy : \u2212 cos \u03b8 e\u2212r|p| ip\n\nd\u03b8 \u2227 dy : sin \u03b8 r e\u2212r|p| ip\n\n(4.36)\n\nThis two-form is regular, and a quick way to check this is to see that near \u03b8 = 0 and \u03b8 = \u03c0\nit looks like dy \u2227 (. . .) and (2d\u03c6 + \u03b3 \u22121 dy) \u2227 (. . .), respectively.\nNow we can compute the two-form symplectic current using Eq.

Discussion\nIn this paper we have quantized the moduli space of the regular D1-D5 geometries, and used\nthis result to count the D1-D5 black hole microstates, directly from SUGRA. The method\nis based on our previous work [2, 3], and incorporates a new ingredient-the consistency\ncondition-which allowed us to reduce the computational work needed to obtain the general\nresult. Most certainly, this new ingredient will play a role in the future applications of the\nsymplectic form quantization to the other SUGRA moduli spaces, such as the 3-charge\nmoduli space parametrized by hyper-Kaehler manifolds [9].\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\fOur result fits nicely with the general idea of Mathur's program [1], which can be loosely\ndescribed as aiming to understand the inner structure of quantum black holes purely from\nSUGRA, i.e. without D-branes. Recently, several interesting results breathed new life into\nthe program and opened up new avenues of research. In [13], it was demonstrated how\nthe emergence of an effective black hole geometry may be seen from AdS/CFT correlators\nin a typical D1-D5 ground state. In [14], it was shown how an effective geometry may\nbe recovered by studying boundary 1-point functions. It would be very interesting to\ncombine these two approaches and derive a truly emergent horizon of the D1-D5 black\nhole. Another problem which needs to eventually be addressed is the derivation of the\nnonzero area horizon from the curvature-corrected SUGRA Lagrangian. In the best of the\nworlds, these two derivations would produced horizons of the same size. The future will\nshow if this is indeed the case.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank V.
