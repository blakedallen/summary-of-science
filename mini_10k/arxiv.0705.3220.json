INTRODUCTION\n\nThere is an intimate relationship between microscopic structure and mechanical properties of\ncomposite materials [1-5]. Knowledge of both is therefore a prerequisite if one wishes to\nmodel this link [6-8]. A precise characterization of the three-dimensional composite structure,\nhowever, is usually difficult, as it has often to be reconstructed from two-dimensional images\nmade on surfaces, cuts or thin slices, using electron microscopy techniques or Atomic Force\nMicroscopy [9-11]. Scattering is a powerful tool to access the bulk structure in a nondestructive way [12,13]. X-ray scattering is well suited for many polymer-inorganic\ncomposites [14-16], but neutron scattering is preferred here due to the extended q-range (with\nrespect to standard x-ray lab-sources), giving access to length scales between some and\nseveral thousand Angstroms. Also, cold neutrons penetrate more easily macroscopically thick\nsamples, and they offer the possibility to extract the conformation of polymer chains inside\nthe composite in future work [17]. Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) is therefore a\nmethod of choice to unveil the structure of nanocomposites.\n\nThis article deals with the structural analysis by SANS of silica aggregates in a polymeric\nmatrix. Such structures have been investigated by many authors, often with the scope of\nmechanical reinforcement [18-21], but sometimes also in solution [22-24]. One major\ndrawback of scattering methods is that the structure is obtained in reciprocal space. It is\nsometimes possible to read off certain key features like fractal dimensions directly from the\nintensity curves, and extensive modeling can be done, e.g. in the presence of a hierarchy of\nfractal dimensions, using the famous Beaucage expressions [25]. Also, major progress has\nbeen made with inversion to real space data [26]. Nonetheless, complex structures like\ninteracting aggregates of filler particles embedded in an elastomer for reinforcement purposes\n\n\f4\nare still an important challenge. The scope of this article is to report on recent progress in this\nfield.\n\nII. MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nII.1 Sample preparation.\n\nWe briefly recall the sample preparation, which is presented in [27]. The starting components\nare aqueous colloidal suspensions of silica from Akzo Nobel (Bindzil 30/220 and Bindzil\n40/130), and nanolatex polymer beads. The latter was kindly provided by Rhodia. It is a coreshell latex of randomly copolymerized Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and\nPoly(butylacrylate) (PBuA), with some hydrophilic polyelectrolyte (methacrylic acid) on the\nsurface. From the analysis of the form factors of silica and nanolatex measured separately by\nSANS in dilute aqueous solutions we have deduced the radii and polydispersities of a lognormal size distribution of spheres [27]. The silica B30 has an approximate average radius of\n78 \u00c5 (resp. 96 \u00c5 for B40), with about 20% (resp. 28%) polydispersity, and the nanolatex 143\n\u00c5 (24% polydispersity).\n\nColloidal stock solutions of silica and nanolatex are brought to desired concentration and pH,\nmixed, and degassed under primary vacuum in order to avoid bubble formation. Slow\nevaporation of the solvent at T = 65\u00b0C under atmospheric pressure takes about four days,\nconditions which have been found suitable for the synthesis of smooth and bubble-free films\nwithout any further thermal treatment. The typical thickness is between 0.5 and 1 mm, i.e.\nfilms are macroscopically thick.\n\n\f5\nII.2 Small Angle Neutron Scattering.\n\nThe data discussed here have been obtained in experiments performed at ILL on beamline\nD11 [27]. The wavelength was fixed to 10.0 \u00c5 and the sample-to-detector distances were 1.25\nm, 3.50 m, 10.00 m, 36.70 m, with corresponding collimation distances of 5.50 m, 5.50 m,\n10.50 m and 40.00 m, respectively. Primary data treatment has been done following standard\nprocedures, with the usual subtraction of empty cell scattering and H2O as secondary\ncalibration standard [12]. Intensities have been converted to cm-1 using a measurement of the\ndirect beam intensity. Background runs of pure dry nanolatex films show only incoherent\nscattering due to the high concentration of protons, as expected for unstructured random\ncopolymers. The resulting background is flat and very low as compared to the coherent\nscattering in the presence of silica, and has been subtracted after the primary data treatment.\n\nIII. STRUCTURAL MODELLING\n\nIII.1 Silica-latex model nanocomposites.\n\nWe have studied silica-latex nanocomposites made by drying a mixture of latex and silica\ncolloidal solutions. The nanometric silica beads can be kept from aggregating during the\ndrying process by increasing the precursor solution pH, and thus their electric charge.\nConversely, aggregation can be induced by reducing the solution pH. The resulting\nnanocomposite has been shown to have very interesting mechanical properties even at low\nfiller volume fraction. The reinforcement factor, e.g., which is expressed as the ratio of\nYoungs modulus of the composite and the one of its matrix, E/Elatex, can be varied by a factor\nof several tens at constant volume fraction of silica (typically from 3 to 15%) [28,29]. In this\ncontext it is important to recognize that the silica-polymer interface is practically unchanged\n\n\f6\nfrom one sample to the other, in the sense that there are no ligands or grafted chains\nconnecting the silica to the matrix. There might be changes to the presence of ions, but their\nimpact on the reinforcement factor appears to be of 2nd order [30]. Possible changes in the\nmatrix properties are cancelled in the reinforcement factor representation, the influence of the\nsilica structure is thus clearly highlighted in our experiments. Using a simplified analysis of\nthe structural data measured by SANS, we could show that (i) the silica bead aggregation was\nindeed governed by the solution pH, and (ii) the change in aggregation number Nagg was\naccompanied by a considerable change in reinforcement factor at constant silica volume\nfraction. Although we had convincing evidence for aggregation, it seemed difficult to close\nthe gap and verify that the estimated Nagg was indeed compatible with the measured intensity\ncurves. This illustrates one of the key problems in the physical understanding of the\nreinforcement effect: interesting systems for reinforcement are usually highly crowded,\nmaking structural analysis complicated and thereby impeding the emergence of a clear\nstructure-mechanical properties relationship. It is the scope of this article to propose a method\nfor structural analysis in such systems.\n\nIII.2 Modelling the scattered intensity for interacting aggregates.\n\nFor monodisperse silica spheres of volume Vsi, the scattered intensity due to some arbitrary\nspatial organization can be decomposed in the product of contrast \u2206\u03c1, volume fraction of\nspheres \u03a6, structure factor, and the normalized form factor of individual spheres, P(q) [12,\n13]. If in addition spheres are organized in monodisperse aggregates, the structure factor can\nbe separated in the intra-aggregate structure factor Sintra(q), and a structure factor describing\nthe center-of-mass correlations of aggregates, Sinter(q):\n\nI(q) = \u2206\u03c12 \u03a6 Vsi Sinter(q) Sintra(q) P(q)\n\n(1)\n\n\f7\nHere the product Sintra(q) P(q) can also be interpreted as the average form factor of aggregates,\nas it would be measured at infinite dilution of aggregates. In order to be able to compare it to\nthe intensity in cm-1, we keep the prefactors and define the aggregate form factor Pagg =\u2206\u03c12 \u03a6\nVsi Sintra(q) P(q).\n\nThe above mentioned conditions like monodispersity are not completely met in our\nexperimental system. However, it can be considered sufficiently close to such an ideal\nsituation for this simple scattering law to be applicable. The small polydispersity in silica\nbeads, e.g., is not expected to induce specific aggregate structures. At larger scale, the\nmonodispersity of the aggregates is a working hypothesis. It is plausible because of the strong\nscattering peak in I(q), which will be discussed with the data. Strong peaks are usually\nassociated with ordered and thus not too polydisperse domain sizes [31].\n\nTo understand the difficulty of the structural characterization of the nanocomposites discussed\nhere, one has to see that aggregates of unknown size interact with each other through an\nunknown potential, which determined their final (frozen) structure. Or from a more technical\npoint of view, we know neither the intra- nor the inter-aggregate structure factor, respectively\ndenoted Sintra(q) (or equivalently, Pagg(q)), and Sinter(q).\n\nIn the following, we propose a method allowing the separation of the scattered intensity in\nPagg(q) and Sinter(q), on the assumption of (a) a (relative) monodispersity in aggregate size, and\n(b) that Pagg is smooth in the q-range around the maximum of Sinter. The inter-aggregate\nstructure factor will be described with a well-known model structure factor developed for\nsimple liquids and applied routinely to repulsively interacting colloids [32-34]. The second\nfactor of the intensity, the aggregate form factor, will be analyzed in two different ways. First,\n\n\f8\nPagg will be compared to fractal models [25]. Then, in a second part, its modeling in direct\nspace by Reverse Monte Carlo will be implemented and discussed [35-39].\n\nDetermination of the average aggregation number and Sinter.\n\nAggregation number and aggregate interaction need to be determined first. The silica-latex\nnanocomposites discussed here have a relatively well-ordered structure of the filler phase, as\ncan be judged from the prominent correlation peak in I(q), see Fig. 1 as an example for data.\nThe peak is also shown in the upper inset in linear scale. The position of this correlation peak\nqo corresponds to a typical length scale of the sample, 2\u03c0/qo, the most probable distance\nbetween aggregates. As the volume fraction (e.g., \u03a6 = 5% in Fig.1) and the volume of the\nelementary silica filler particles Vsi are known, one can estimate the average aggregation\nnumber:\n\nNagg = (2\u03c0/qo)3 \u03a6/Vsi\n\n(2)\n\nTwo ingredients are necessary for the determination of the inter aggregate structure factor.\nThe first one is the intensity in absolute units, or alternatively the independent measurement\nof scattering from isolated silica particles, i.e. at high dilution and under known contrast\nconditions and identical resolution. The second is a model for the structure factor of objects in\nrepulsive interaction. We have chosen a well-known quasi-analytical structure factor based on\nthe Rescaled Mean Spherical Approximation (RMSA) [33,34]. Originally, it was proposed for\ncolloidal particles of volume V, at volume fraction \u03a6, carrying an electrostatic charge Q, and\ninteracting through a medium characterized by a Debye length \u03bbD. In the present study, we\nuse this structure factor as a parametrical expression, with Q and \u03bbD as parameters tuning the\n\n\f9\nrepulsive potential. The Debye length, with represents the screening in solutions, corresponds\nhere to the range of the repulsive potential, whereas Q allows to vary the intensity of the\ninteraction. Although the spatial organization of the silica beads in the polymer matrix is due\nto electrostatic interactions in solution before film formation, we emphasize that this original\nmeaning is lost in the present, parametrical description.\n\nFor the calculation of Sinter, \u03a6 is given by the silica volume fraction, and the aggregate volume\nV = 4\u03c0/3 Re3 by Nagg Vsi, with Nagg determined by eq.(2). Re denotes the effective radius of a\nsphere representing an aggregate. In principle, we are thus left with two parameters, Q and \u03bbD.\nThe range \u03bbD must be typically of the order of the distance between the surfaces of\nneighboring aggregates represented by effective charged spheres of radius Re, otherwise the\nstructure factor would not be peaked as experimentally observed. As a starting value, we have\nchosen to set \u03bbD equal to the average distance between neighboring aggregate surfaces. We\nwill come back to the determination of \u03bbD below, and regard it as fixed for the moment. Then\nonly the effective charge Q remains to be determined.\n\nHere the absolute units of the intensity come into play. Nagg is known from the peak position,\nand thus also the low-q limit of Sintra(q\u21920), because forward scattering of isolated objects\ngives directly the mass of an aggregate [12]. The numerical value of the (hypothetical)\nforward scattering in the absence of interaction can be directly calculated using eq.(1), setting\nSintra = Nagg and Sinter = 1. Of course the aggregates in our nanocomposites are not isolated, as\ntheir repulsion leads to the intensity peak and a depression of the intensity at small angles.\nThe limit of I(q\u21920) contains thus also an additional factor, Sinter(q\u21920). In colloid science,\nthis factor is known as the isothermal osmotic compressibility [12], and here its equivalent\ncan be deduced from the ratio of the isolated aggregate limit of the intensity (Sintra = Nagg, Sinter\n\n\f10\n= 1), and the experimentally measured one I(q\u21920). It characterizes the strength of the\naggregate-aggregate interaction.\n\nBased on the RMSA-structure factor [33,34], we have implemented a search routine which\nfinds the effective charge Q reproducing Sinter(q\u21920). With \u03bbD fixed, we are left with one free\nparameter, Q, which entirely determines the q-dependence of the inter-aggregate structure\nfactor. An immediate cross-check is that the resulting Sinter(q) is peaked in the same q-region\nas the experimental intensity. In Fig. 1, the decomposition of the intensity in Sinter(q) and\nSintra(q) is shown. It has been achieved with an aggregation number of 93, approximately forty\ncharges per aggregate, and a Debye length of 741 \u00c5, i.e. 85% of the average surface-tosurface distance between aggregates, and we come now back to the determination of \u03bbD.\n\nIn Fig. 2, a series of inter-aggregate structure factors is shown with different Debye lengths:\n50%, 85% and 125% of the distance between neighboring aggregate surfaces (872 \u00c5). The\ncharges needed to obtain the measured compressibility are 27, 40 and 64.5, respectively. In\nFig. 2, the inter-aggregate structure factors are seen to be peaked in the vicinity of the\nexperimentally observed peak, with higher peak heights for the lower Debye lengths.\nDividing the measured intensity I(q) by \u2206\u03c12 \u03a6 Vsi P(q) Sinter yields Sintra, also presented in the\nplot. At low-q, these structure factors decrease strongly, then pass through a minimum and a\nmaximum at intermediate q , and tend towards one at large q (not shown). The high-q\nmaximum is of course due to the interaction between primary particles.\n\nIn the low-q decrease, it can be observed that a too strong peak in Sinter leads to a depression\nof Sintra at the same q-value. Conversely, a peak that is too weak leads to a shoulder in Sintra.\nOnly at intermediate values of the Debye length (85%), Sintra is relatively smooth. In the\nfollowing, it is supposed that there is no reason for Sintra to present artefacts in the decrease\n\n\f11\nfrom the Guinier regime to the global minimum (bumps or shoulders), and set the Debye\nlength to the intermediate value (85%) for this sample. We have also checked that small\nvariations around this intermediate Debye length (80 to 90%) yield essentially identical\nstructure factors, with peak height differences of a view percent. This procedure of adjusting\n\u03bbD to the value with a smooth Sintra has been applied to all data discussed in this paper.\n\nFitting Sintra using geometrical and fractal models.\n\nUp to now, we have determined the inter-aggregate structure factor, and then deduced the\nexperimental intra-aggregate structure factor Sintra as shown in Fig.2 by dividing the intensity\nby Sinter according to eq.(1). To extract direct-space information from Sintra for aggregates of\nunknown shape, two types of solutions can be sought. First, one can make use of the\nknowledge of the average aggregation number, and construct average aggregates in real\nspace. This supposes some idea of possible structures, which can then be Fourier-transformed\nand compared to the experimental result Sintra(q). For example, one may try small crystallites\n[40], or, in another context, amorphous aggregates [41]. Another prominent case is the one of\nfractal structures, which are often encountered in colloidal aggregation [42 - 44].\n\nLet us quickly discuss the scattering function of finite-sized fractals using the unified law with\nboth Guinier regime and power law dependence [25, 45]. An isolated finite-sized object with\nfractal geometry described by a fractal dimension d has three distinct scattering domains. At\nlow q (roughly q < 1/Rg), the Guinier law reflects the finite size and allows the measurement\nof the aggregate mass from the intensity plateau, and of the radius of gyration Rg from the\nlow-q decay. At intermediate q (q > 1/Rg), the intensity follows a power law q-d up to the\nhigh-q regime (q > 1/R), which contains the shape information of the primary particles (of\n\n\f12\nradius R) making up the aggregate. Generalizations to higher level structures have also been\nused [46-49]. Here we use a two-level description following Beaucage [25]:\n\nd\n\n\uf8f1 [erf (qR g / 61/ 2 )] 3 \uf8fc\n\uf8eb q 2R g2 \uf8f6\n\uf8eb q 2R 2 \uf8f6\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nI(q )=G1 \u22c5exp\uf8ec\uf8ec \u2212\n\u22c5\nexp\n\uf8f7\uf8f7+B1 \u22c5\uf8f2\n\uf8ec\uf8ec \u2212\n\uf8f7\n\uf8fd\nq\n3 \uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8ed 3 \uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f4\uf8f3\n\uf8f4\uf8fe\np\n\n\uf8f1\uf8f4 [erf (qR / 61/ 2 )] 3 \uf8fc\uf8f4\n\uf8eb q 2R 2 \uf8f6\n+ G 2 \u22c5exp\uf8ec\uf8ec \u2212\n\uf8f7+ B \u22c5\n\uf8fd\n3 \uf8f7\uf8f8 2 \uf8f2\uf8f4\nq\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f4\uf8fe\n\uf8f3\n\n(3)\n\nNote that there is no interaction term like Sinter in eq.(1), and that eq.(3) accounts only for\nintra-aggregate structure in this case. The first term on the right-hand-side of eq.(3) is the\nGuinier expression of the total aggregate. The second term, i.e. the first power law,\ncorresponds to the fractal structure of the aggregate, the error function allowing for a smooth\ncross-over. This fractal law is weighted by the Guinier expression of the second level, which\nis the scattering of the primary silica particle in our case; this effectively suppresses the fractal\nlaw of the first level at high q. This is followed by an equivalent expression of the higher\nlevel, i.e. a Guinier law of primary particles followed by the power-law, which is the Porod\nlaw of the primary particles in this case.\n\nFitting Sintra using Reverse Monte Carlo.\n\nThe second solution to extract real-space information from Sintra is to fit the intra-aggregate\nstructure factor by a Monte-Carlo approach which we describe here. It has been called\nReverse Monte Carlo (RMC) [35-39] because it is based on a feed-back between the structure\nin direct and reciprocal space, which makes it basically an automatic fitting procedure once\nthe model is defined. The application of RMC to the determination of the aggregate structure\nfrom the scattered intensity is illustrated (in 2D) in Fig. 3. RMC was performed with a\n\n\f13\nspecially developed Fortran program as outlined in the Appendix. The method consists in\ngenerating representative aggregate shapes by moving elements of the aggregate in a random\nway - these are the Monte Carlo steps -, and calculate the corresponding structure factor at\neach step. The intensity is then compared to the experimentally measured one, which gives a\ncriterion whether the Monte Carlo step is to be accepted or not. Monte-Carlo steps are\nrepeated until no further improvement is obtained. If the algorithm converges, the outcome is\na structure compatible with the scattered intensity. As an immediate result, it allows us to\nverify that an aggregate containing Nagg filler particles - Nagg being determined from the peak\nposition qo - produces indeed the observed scattered intensity.\n\nIV. APPLICATION TO EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\n\nIV.1 Moderate volume fraction of silica (\u03a6\n\u03a6 = 5%, B30).\n\nAggregate interaction.\n\nWe now apply our analysis to the measured silica-latex nanocomposite structures [27]. We\nstart with the example already discussed before (Figs. 1 and 2), i.e. a sample with a moderate\nsilica volume fraction of 5%, and neutral solution pH before solvent evaporation. From the\npeak position (q = 3.9 10-3 \u00c5-1), an average aggregation number of Nagg = 93 can be deduced\nusing eq.(2). The aggregate mass gives us the hypothetical low-q limit of the intensity for\nnon-interaction aggregates using eq. (1), with Sinter =1, of 9550 cm-1. The measured value\nbeing much lower, approximately 450 cm-1, with some error induced by the extrapolation, the\nisothermal compressibility due to the interaction between aggregates amounts to about 0.05.\nThis rather low number expresses the strong repulsive interaction. The charged spheres\nrepresenting the aggregates in the inter-aggregate structure factor calculation have the same\n\n\f14\nvolume as the aggregates, and thus an equivalent radius of Re = 367 \u00c5. The surface-to-surface\ndistance between spheres is therefore 872 \u00c5. Following the discussion of Fig. 2, we have set\nthe screening length \u03bbD to 85% of this value, 741 \u00c5. Using this input in the RMSAcalculation, together with the constraint on the compressibility, an electric charge of 40\nelementary charges per aggregate is found. The corresponding s Sinter are plotted in Fig. 2.\n\nFractal modeling.\n\nA fit with a two level fractal, eq.(3), has been performed with the aggregate form factor Pagg\nobtained by dividing the experimental intensity by Sinter. The result is shown in Fig. 4. There\nare several parameters to the fit, some of which can be found independently. The slope of the\nhigh-q power law, e.g., has been fixed to p= \u20134, in agreement with the Porod law. The radius\nof gyration of the primary particles is 76 \u00c5, and the corresponding prefactor G2 can be\ndeduced from the particle properties [27] and concentration (103 cm-1). For comparison, the\nform factor of the individual particle is shown in Fig. 4 as a one level Beaucage function, i.e.\nusing only the last two terms of eq. (3). Furthermore, we have introduced the G1 value of\n9550 cm-1 calculated from Nagg, i.e. from the peak position. Fitting yields the radius of\ngyration of aggregates (1650 \u00c5), and a fractal dimension of 1.96. At intermediate q, however,\nthe quality of the fit is less satisfying. The discrepancy is due to the minimum of Sintra (cf. Fig.\n2) around 0.02 \u00c5-1, a feature which is not captured by the model used here (eq. (3)).\n\nReverse Monte Carlo.\n\nWe now report on the results of the implementation of an RMC-routine applied to the\nstructure of the sample discussed above (\u03a6 = 5%, pH 7). In Fig. 5, we plot the evolution of \u03c72\n(cf. appendix) as a function of the number of Monte-Carlo tries for each bead (on average),\nstarting from the a random initial condition as defined in the appendix. For illustration\n\n\f15\npurposes, this is compared to the \u03c72 from different initial conditions, i.e. aggregates\nconstructed according to the same rule but with a different random seed. Such initial\naggregate structures are also shown on the left-hand side of Fig. 6. In all cases, the \u03c72 value is\nseen to decrease in Fig. 5 by about two orders of magnitude within five Monte-Carlo steps per\nbead. It then levels off to a plateau, around which it fluctuates due to the Boltzmann criterion.\nWe have checked that much longer runs do not further increase the quality of the fit, cf. the\ninset of Fig. 5. The corresponding aggregates at the beginning and at the end of the simulation\nrun are also shown in Fig.6. They are of course different depending on the initial condition\nand angle of view, but their statistical properties are identical, otherwise their Fourier\ntransform would not fit the experimental data. It is interesting to see how much the final\naggregate structures, rather elongated, look similar.\n\nHaving established that the algorithm robustly produces aggregates with similar statistical\nproperties, we now compare the result to the experimental intensity in Fig. 7. Although some\nminor deviations between the intensities are still present, the agreement over five decades in\nintensity is quite remarkable. It shows that the aggregation number determined from the peak\nposition qo is indeed a reasonable value, as it allows the construction of a representative\naggregate with almost identical scattering behavior. In the lower inset of Fig.7, the RMC\nresult for the aggregate form factor Pagg is compared to the experimental one (obtained by\ndividing the I(q) of Fig.7 by Sinter). The fit is good, especially as the behavior around 0.02 \u00c5-1\nis better described than in the case of the fractal model, Fig. 4.\n\nThe radius of gyration can be calculated from the position of the primary particles in one\ngiven realization. We find Rg around 1150 \u00c5, a bit smaller than with the fractal model (1650\n\u00c5), a difference probably due to the fact that we are only approaching the low-q plateau. For\nthe comparison of the fractal model to RMC, let us recall that both apply only to Pagg, i.e. after\n\n\f16\nthe separation of the intensity in aggregate form factor Pagg and structure factor Sinter. Both\nmethods give the same fractal dimension d of aggregates because this corresponds to the same\nslope of Pagg. The aggregate form factor Pagg and thus the intensity are better (although not\nperfectly) fitted with RMC. This is true namely for the minimum around 0.02\n\n\u00c5-1,\n\npresumably because the nearest neighbor correlations inside each aggregate are captured by a\nphysical model of touching beads. Last but not least, RMC gives snapshots of 3D real-space\nstructures compatible with the scattered intensity, which validates the determination of Nagg\nusing eq. (2).\n\nFor the sake of completeness, we have tested RMC with aggregation numbers different from\nthe one deduced from the peak position. Taking a very low aggregation number (i.e., smaller\nthan the value obtained with eq.(2))) leads to bad fits, whereas higher aggregation numbers\ngive at first sight acceptable fits. The problem with too high aggregation numbers is that the\npeak position of Sinter is different from the position of the intensity peak due to conservation of\nsilica volume. RMC compensates for this by introducing an oscillation in Sintra (or\nequivalently, Pagg) which effectively shifts the peak to its experimentally measured position.\nIn the upper inset of Fig.7 Pagg presenting such an artefact (Nagg = 120 and 150) is compared\nto the one with the nominal aggregation number, Nagg = 93 (filled symbols). The oscillation\naround 0.004 \u00c5-1 is not present with Nagg = 93, and becomes stronger as the aggregation\nnumber deviates more from the value determined from the intensity peak position, eq.(2).\n\nIV.2 Evolution with silica volume fraction.\n\nIn the preceding section we have analyzed a sample at moderate silica volume fraction, 5%. It\nis now interesting to check if the same type of modeling can be applied to higher silica\n\n\f17\nvolume fractions and bigger aggregates (i.e., lower solution pH), where the structure factor\ncan be seen to be more prominent directly from I(q).\n\n\u03a6 = 5 and 10%, B30).\nEvolution of structure with silica volume fraction (\u03a6\n\nIn Fig. 8, two data sets corresponding to a lower pH of 5, for \u03a6 = 5% and 10% (symbols) are\ncompared to their RMC fits, in linear representation in order to emphasize the peaks. The\nparameters used for these calculations are given in Table 1, together with the aggregation\nnumbers deduced from the peak position (using eq. (2)). As expected, these are considerably\nhigher than at pH 7 [27]. Concerning the Debye length, it is interesting to note that its value\nrelative to the inter-aggregate distance increases with volume fraction. As we have seen in\nsection III.2, a higher Debye length leads to a weaker peak. This tendency is opposite to the\ninfluence of the volume fraction, and we have checked that the peak in Sinter is comparable in\nheight in both cases, i.e. the two tendencies compensate.\n\nAt first sight of Fig. 8, it is surprising that the intensity at 10% is lower than the one at 5%.\nThis is only true at small-q \u2013 the 10% intensity being higher in the Porod domain, as it should,\ncf. Pagg shown in the inset in log-scale. At both concentrations, the aggregate shape seems to\nbe unchanged, (similar fractal dimension d, 2.25 and 2.3 for 5% and 10%, respectively), and\ntogether with the shift in peak position by a factor 21\u20443 (as \u03a6 is doubled) to a region where Pagg\nis much lower, it explains the observed decrease in intensity. We will see in the discussion of\na series with the silica B40 that this behavior is not general, and that aggregation depends (as\nobserved before [27]) on the type of bead.\n\nFor illustration, the scattered intensity corresponding to the random initial condition of RMC\n(cf. appendix) is also shown in Fig. 8. The major initial deviation from the experimental\n\n\f18\nvalues underlines the capacity of the RMC algorithm to converge quickly (cf. Fig. 5) towards\na very satisfying fit of the experimental intensity. Note that there is a small angle upturn for\nthe sample at 10%. This may be due to aggregation on a very large scale, which is outside the\nscope and the possibilities of our method.\n\nEvolution of structure with silica volume fraction (\u03a6\n\u03a6 = 3% - 15%, B40)\n\nWe now turn to a series of samples with a different, slightly bigger silica beads (denoted\nB40), in a highly aggregated state (low pH), with a larger range of volume fractions. In Fig. 9\nthe intensities are plotted with the RMC fits, for the series \u03a6 = 3 \u2013 15%, at pH 5, silica B40.\nThe parameters used for the calculations are given in the Table 2.\n\nThe fits shown in Fig. 9 are very good, which demonstrates that the model works well over a\nlarge range of volume fractions, i.e. varying aggregate-aggregate interaction. Concerning the\nparameters Debye length and charge, we have checked that the peaks in Sinter are comparable\nin height (within 10%). Only their position shifts, as it was observed with the smaller silica\n(B30). Unlike the case of B30, however, the intensities follow a 'normal' increase with\nincrease in volume fraction, which suggests a different evolution in aggregate shape and size\nfor the bigger beads.\n\nThe case of the lowest volume fraction, \u03a6 = 3%, deserves some discussion. The aggregation\nnumber is estimated to 188 using eq. (2). The peak is rather weak due to the low\nconcentration, and it is also close to the minimum q-value. We thus had to base our analysis\non an estimation of I(q\u21920), 700 cm-1. The resulting inter-aggregate structure factor Sinter is as\nexpected only slightly peaked (peak height 1.1). We found that some variation of Nagg does\nnot deteriorate the quality of the fit, i.e. small variations do not introduce artificial oscillations\n\n\f19\nin the aggregate form factor. We have, e.g., checked that the aggregate form factors Pagg for\nNagg = 120 and 200 are equally smooth. At higher/lower aggregation number, like 100 or 230,\noscillations appear in Pagg. It is concluded that in this rather dilute case the weak ordering does\nnot allow for a precise determination of Nagg. For higher volume fractions, \u03a6>3%, the\naggregation numbers given in Table 2 are trustworthy.\n\nV. DISCUSSION\nV.1 Uniqueness of the solution.\n\nThe question of the uniqueness of the solution found by RMC arises naturally. Here two\ndifferent levels need to be discussed. The first one concerns the separation in aggregate form\nand structure factor. We have shown that the aggregate parameters (Nagg, aggregate\ninteraction) are fixed by the boundary conditions. Only in the case of weak interaction (\u03a6 =\n3%), acceptable solutions with quite different aggregation numbers (between about 120 and\n200) can be found. In the other cases, variations by some 15% in Nagg lead to bad intensity fits\nor artefacts in the aggregate form factor Pagg. We can thus confirm that one of the main\nobjectives is reached, namely that it is possible to find an aggregate of well-defined mass\n(given by eq.(2)), the scattering of which is compatible with the intensity.\n\nThe second level is to know to what extend the RMC-realizations of aggregates are unique\nsolutions. It is clear from the procedure that many similar realizations are created as the\nnumber of Monte Carlo steps increases (e.g., the plateau in Fig. 5), all with a comparable\nquality of fit. In Fig. 5, this is also seen to be independent from the initial condition, and Figs.\n6 and 8 illustrated how far this initial condition is from the final structure. All the final\n\n\f20\nrealizations have equivalent statistical properties, and they can be looked at as representatives\nof a class of aggregates with identical scattering. However, no unique solution exists.\n\nV.2 From aggregate structure to elastomer reinforcement.\n\nWe have shown in previous work that the mechanical properties of our nanocomposites\ndepend strongly on aggregation number and silica volume fraction [28-30]. The aggregation\nnumber was estimated from the peak position, and we have now confirmed that such\naggregates are indeed compatible with the complete scattering curves. It is therefore\ninteresting to see how the real-space structures found by our method compare to the\nmechanical properties of the nanocomposites.\n\nThe low deformation reinforcement factors of the series in silica volume fraction (B40, pH5,\n\u03a6 = 3 \u2013 15%) are recalled in Table 3 [30]. E/Elatex is found to increase considerably with \u03a6,\nmuch more than Nagg. Aggregate structures as resulting from the RMC-procedure applied to\nthe data in Fig. 9 are shown in Fig. 10. At low \u03a6, aggregates are rather elongated, and with\nincreasing \u03a6, they are seen to become slightly bulkier. We have determined their radii of\ngyration and fractal dimension with a one-level Beaucage fit, using only the first two terms of\nthe right-hand-side of eq. (3), and applying the same method as in section IV.1. The results\nare summarized in Table 3. The fractal dimension is found to increase with \u03a6, as expected\nfrom Fig. 10. The aggregate radius Rg first decreases, then increases again. If we compare Rg\nto the average distance between aggregates D (from the peak position of Sinter), we find a\ncrowded environment. The aggregates appear to be tenuous structures, with an overall radius\nof gyration bigger than the average distance between aggregates, which suggests aggregate\ninterpenetration.\n\n\f21\nIn a recent article [30], we have determined the effective aggregate radius and fractal\ndimension from a mechanical model relating E/Elatex to the compacity of aggregates. The\nnumerical values are different (aggregate radii between 1200 and 980 \u00c5, fractal dimensions\nbetween 2.1 and 2.45) due to the mechanical model which represents aggregates as spheres,\nbut the tendency is the same: Radii decrease as \u03a6 increases, implying bulkier aggregates with\nhigher fractal dimensions. Only the increase in radius found at 15% is not captured by the\nmechanical model.\n\nOur picture of reinforcement in this system is the based on the idea of percolation of hard\nsilica structures in the matrix. Due to the (quasi-)incompressibility of the elastomer matrix,\nstrain in any direction is accompanied by lateral compression, thus pushing aggregates\ntogether and creating mechanical percolation. Aggregates are tenuous, interpenetrating\nstructures. The higher the silica volume fraction, the more compact the aggregates (higher d),\nand the stronger the percolating links. At low \u03a6, Nagg is more or less constant, which implies\nthat the aggregates decrease in size, cf. Table 3 for both fractal and RMC-analysis. Above 6%,\nNagg increases, and the aggregates become both denser and grow again in size. At the same\ntime, aggregates come closer (D goes down). This moves the system closer to percolation, and\nleads to the important increase in the reinforcement factor. In other systems, this is also what\nthe reinforcement curves as a function of filler volume fraction suggest [28], where extremely\nstrong structures made of the percolating hard filler phase are found above a critical volume\nfraction [50].\n\nVI. CONCLUSION\n\nWe have presented a complete analysis of the scattering function of complex spectra arising\nfrom strongly aggregated and interacting colloidal silica aggregates in nanocomposites. The\n\n\f22\nmain result is the validation of the determination of the average aggregation number by a\ncomplete fit of the data. This is achieved by a separation of the scattered intensity in a product\nof aggregate form and structure factor. The aggregate form factor can then be described either\nby a fractal model, or by Reverse Monte Carlo modeling. The use of the decomposition of\nI(q) in a product is based on the assumption that aggregates are similar in size. This is\njustified by the strong peak in intensity, which indicates strong ordering, incompatible with\ntoo high polydispersity in size.\n\nFractal and RMC-modelling appear to be complementary, with the advantage of generality\nand simplicity for the fractal model, whereas RMC needs numerical simulations adapted to\neach case. However, RMC does not rely on approximations (Guinier), and by its geometrical\nconstruction it connects local configurations (bead-bead) to the global structure. RMC thus\ngives a real space picture of aggregates compatible with I(q), and thereby confirms calculation\nof aggregation numbers from the peak positions.\n\nTo finish, possible improvements of our method can be discussed. Technically, the\nintroduction of the spectrometer resolution function is straightforward but would not\nfundamentally change results, and considerably slow down the algorithm. A more ambitious\nproject is be to get rid of the separation in aggregate form and structure factor by performing a\nRMC-simulation of a large system containing many aggregates [51]. It will be interesting to\nsee if the Monte-Carlo algorithm converges spontaneously towards more or less monodisperse\naggregates, or if very different solutions, not considered in the present work, exist.\n\n\f23\nAcknowledgements : Work conducted within the scientific program of the European\nNetwork of Excellence Softcomp: 'Soft Matter Composites: an approach to nanoscale\nfunctional materials', supported by the European Commission.

From the\nintensity peak position and eq.(2), the aggregation number Nagg is known. The primary\nparticles are the silica beads with a radius drawn from a size distribution function [27]. The\ninitial aggregate is constructed by adding particles to a seed particle placed at the origin. Each\nnew particle is positioned by randomly choosing one of the particles which are already part of\nthe aggregate, and sticking it to it in a random direction. Then, collisions with all particles in\nthe aggregate at this stage are checked, and the particle is accepted if there are no collisions.\nThis is repeated until Nagg is reached. Two realizations of initial aggregate structures are\nshown in Fig. 6.\n\nA.2 Monte-Carlo steps\n\nThe Monte-Carlo steps are designed to change the shape of the aggregate, in order to reach\ncloser agreement with the scattering data. To do this, the local aggregate topology has to be\ndetermined. The aim is to identify particles which can be removed from the aggregate without\nbreaking it up, i.e. particles which sit on the (topological) surface of the aggregate. Moving\nsuch particles to another position in the aggregate leads to a new structure with updated\ntopology. A Monte-Carlo step thus consists in randomly choosing one of the particles which\ncan be removed, and repositioning it in contact with some other, randomly chosen particle,\nagain in a random direction. As before, it is checked that there are no collisions with the other\nparticles of the aggregate.\n\n\f25\nA.3 Fit to experimental intensity\n\nEach Monte-Carlo step is evaluated by the calculation of the orientationally averaged\naggregate form factor Pagg(q) , which is multiplied by Sinter(q), cf. eq. (1), and compared to the\nexperimental intensity I(q). The comparison is done in terms of \u03c72:\n\n\uf8eb I(q )\u2212I (q ) \uf8f6\n\u03c7 = 1 \u2211\uf8ec i RMC i \uf8f7\nN i \uf8ed\n\u03c3\n\uf8f8\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(A.1)\n\nwhere the difference between RMC-prediction and experimental intensity is summed over the\nN q-values. The statistical error \u03c3 was kept fixed in all calculations. In the our algorithm, the\nmove is accepted if it improves the agreement between the theoretical and experimental\ncurves, or if the increase in \u03c72 is moderate in order to allow for some fluctuations. This is\nimplemented by a Boltzmann criterion on \u03c72:\n\nexp (-\u2206\u03c72/ B) > random number in the interval [0,1]\n\n(A.2)\n\nIn the present implementation, B has been fixed to at most 1% of the plateau value of \u03c72. This\nplateau-value was found to be essentially independent of the choice of B. Given the quality of\nthe fits, a simulated annealing approach was therefore not necessary.\n\n\f26\nReferences:\n\n[1] Science and Technology of Rubber, J.E .Mark, B. Erman, F.R.

In the lower inset, the two structure factors Sinter and Sintra, are\nshown. Such a decomposition is the result of our data analysis as described in\nthe text.\n\nFigure 2 :\n\nStructure factors (for \u03a6 = 5%, pH 7, B30) obtained with different Debye\nlengths and charges, but identical compressibility. \u03bbD = 436 \u00c5 (50%), Q = 64.5\n(\u0001), \u03bbD = 741 \u00c5 (85%), Q = 40 (\u0002). \u03bbD = 1090 \u00c5 (125%), Q = 27 (\u0002). In\nparentheses the Debye lengths as a fraction of the inter-aggregate surface\ndistance (872 \u00c5). In the inset, a zoom on the artefact in Sintra observed at 50%,\nbut not at 85%, is shown.\n\nFigure 3 :\n\nSchematic drawing illustrating the Reverse Monte Carlo algorithm applied to\nthe generation of aggregates. An internal filler particle like the black bead can\nnot be removed without destroying the aggregate.\n\nFigure 4:\n\nFit of the aggregate form factor with the two-level fractal model (G1 = 9550\ncm-1, Rg = 1650 \u00c5, d = 1.96). The one-level model is not a fit. Its parameters\n(G2 = 103 cm-1, radius of gyration R = 76 \u00c5, Porod decay p = -4) have been\ntaken from the form factor of individual silica beads.\n\nFigure 5:\n\nEvolution of \u03c72 with the number of Monte Carlo tries per bead for three\ndifferent initial conditions. In the inset, a long run with 300 tries per bead.\n\n\f30\n\nFigure 6:\n\nGraphical representations of aggregate structures. Two initial configurations\nare shown on the left. The structures on the right are snapshots after 300 (top)\nand 30 (bottom) tries per bead, each starting from the initial configurations on\nthe left.\n\nFigure 7:\n\nStructure of silica-latex nanocomposite (\u0001, \u03a6 = 5%, pH 7, B30) compared to\nthe RMC model prediction (Nagg = 93, solid line). In the lower inset the\naggregate form factor is compared to the RMC result. In the upper inset, the\nRMC-results (Pagg) for higher aggregation numbers (Nagg = 120 and 150, solid\nlines) are compared to the nominal one (Nagg = 93, symbols).\n\nFigure 8:\n\nSANS-intensities of samples (B30 pH5) with silica volume fraction of 5% and\n10% (symbols). The solid lines are the RMC-results. For illustration, the\nintensity of the RMC-algorithm calculated from the initial aggregate\nconfiguration is also shown (10%). In the inset, aggregate form factors Pagg are\ncompared.\n\nFigure 9:\n\nStructure of silica-latex nanocomposites (symbols, \u03a6 = 3%-15, pH 5, B40)\ncompared to the RMC model predictions (see text for details).\n\nFigure 10:\n\nSnapshots of aggregate structures at different silica volume fractions as\ncalculated by RMC (pH5, B40-series).\n\n\f31\nTables\n\n\u03a6\n\nDebye length factor\n\nCharge\n\nNagg\n\n5%\n\n60%\n\n61\n\n430\n\n10%\n\n175%\n\n52\n\n309\n\nTable 1: Parameters used for a successful decomposition in Sinter and an artefact-free Pagg, for\nseries B30, pH5.
