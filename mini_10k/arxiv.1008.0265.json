INTRODUCTION\n\nA large volume of the universe (including interstellar and intergalactic space) is filled with hot, tenuous plasmas.\nCoulomb collisions between charged particles rarely occur in these plasmas and the plasma dynamics are dominated\nby collective phenomena involving particles and electromagnetic fields (e.g., plasma oscillations). Hence, such plasmas\nare known as collisionless plasmas. Even in collisionless plasmas, some kinds of \"shocks\" occur. These shocks generally\nhave very complex formation mechanisms that involve various kinetic processes, including electrostatic instabilities,\nelectromagnetic instabilities, and compression of background magnetic fields. The shocks driven in supernova remnants\n(SNRs) are considered to be collisionless ones.\nSNR shocks propagate in the interstellar medium, which has weak magnetic fields of typically \u223c 3\u03bcG. In the context\nof shocks in magnetized plasmas, the strength of the magnetic field, B0 , is frequently expressed in terms of the\nmagnetization parameter or the sigma parameter, which is defined as the ratio of the magnetic energy density to the\nbulk kinetic energy density of the upstream plasma (both are measured in the shock rest frame). For nonrelativistic\ncases, it is given by\nB02 /8\u03c0\n\u22122\n\u03c3\u2261\n(1)\n2 /2 = MA ,\nne0 (me + mi )Vsh\nwhere ne0 is the electron number density in the upstream plasma, me is the electron mass, mi is the ion mass, Vsh is\nthe shock speed, and MA is the Alfv\u00e9n Mach number. For example, for the shock in SN1006 (except the North-West\nregion), ne0 \u223c 0.05 cm\u22123 and Vsh \u223c 4900 km s\u22121 were inferred (Acero et al. 2007) so that \u03c3 \u223c 4 \u00d7 10\u22125. The recently\ndiscovered 'youngest' SNR G1.9+0.3 is considered to have a shock velocity of Vsh \u223c 14, 000 km s\u22121 (Reynolds et al.\n2008); assuming that ne0 \u223c 0.1 cm\u22123 gives \u03c3 \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 . The sigma generally lies in the range 10\u22126 < \u03c3 < 10\u22123\nfor shocks in young SNRs; these shocks are thus very low-\u03c3 shocks (or, equivalently, very high Alfv\u00e9n Mach number\nshocks).\nMagnetized shocks have been extensively investigated, especially perpendicular shocks in which the background\nmagnetic field is perpendicular to the shock normal. The structure of perpendicular shocks in the supercritical regime\n(MA > MA\u2217 , where MA\u2217 \u223c 3) is known to some extent: a fraction of the incoming ions are reflected at the shock front\n(called the 'ramp') and the reflected ions form a slightly dense region, referred to as the 'foot', in front of the ramp.\nThe ions also accumulate immediately behind the ramp and generate a strong magnetic field there, which is called the\n(magnetic) 'overshoot'. Over the last decade, one-dimensional (1D) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations that can model\nthe kinetic dynamics of both electrons and ions have been performed to investigate high-Mach-number perpendicular\nshocks (e.g., Shimada & Hoshino 2000; Schmitz et al. 2002; Scholer et al. 2003). Recently, several two-dimensional\n(2D) simulations have also been performed (e.g., Umeda et al. 2008; Amano & Hoshino 2009; Lemb\u00e8ge et al. 2009).\nHowever, most simulations have been conducted for relatively strong background magnetic fields (\u03c3 > 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 or\nMA < 15). It is thus desirable to perform simulations for weaker background fields.\nOn the other hand, it was recently demonstrated that certain kinds of collisionless shocks can occur even in unmagnetized plasmas at relativistic shock speeds by performing two- or three-dimensional (3D) PIC simulations (Kato\n2007; Spitkovsky 2008; Chang et al. 2008). In these shocks, the beam\u2013Weibel instability (or filamentation instability)\nis driven in the transition region of the shocks between the counterstreaming electron\u2013positron beams in pair plasmas\nor between the counterstreaming ion beams in electron\u2013ion plasmas and generates strong magnetic fields there. These\ngenerated fields provide an effective dissipation mechanism for collisionless shock formation and are hence often referred\nto as \"Weibel-mediated shocks.\" [Note that the beam\u2013Weibel instability is driven by the counterstreaming beams (c.f.\nFried 1959) and it differs from the ordinary Weibel instability, which is driven by a temperature anisotropy (Weibel\n1959) (see also Davidson et al. (1972)).] These shocks can be driven by relativistic phenomena, such as gamma-ray\nbursts and their afterglows (Medvedev & Loeb 1999; Brainerd 2000), jets from active galactic nuclei, and pulsar\nwinds (Kazimura et al. 1998). It was also shown in our previous paper (Kato & Takabe 2008) that this kind of shock\ncan form in unmagnetized electron\u2013ion plasmas even at nonrelativistic speeds. The beam\u2013Weibel instability can also\nbe important in weakly magnetized shocks. As was shown in our previous paper, the magnetic field generated by the\nion beam\u2013Weibel instability reaches a few percent of the upstream bulk kinetic energy and this value is much higher\nthan the background magnetic field around typical SNR shocks. Therefore, the ion beam\u2013Weibel instability may play\nan important role in the formation of weakly magnetized shocks. Magnetized shocks have been extensively investigated\nby 1D simulations. However, 1D simulations cannot consider the beam\u2013Weibel instability because its wave vector is\nperpendicular to the flow direction. Therefore, it is essential to perform multidimensional simulations to investigate\nthe formation process of weakly magnetized nonrelativistic shocks.\nCollisionless shocks are also considered sites of particle acceleration. In particular, cosmic-rays with energies below\n1015 eV are considered to be accelerated in SNR shocks. Indeed, recent X-ray observations revealed that electrons\nare accelerated to energies of \u223c 1014 eV in several young SNRs (Koyama et al. 1995; Long et al. 2003; Bamba et al.\n2003). It is widely accepted that first-order Fermi acceleration or diffusive shock acceleration is the acceleration mechanism (e.g., Drury 1983; Blandford & Eichler 1987). However, it is currently not possible to determine the fraction of\nthermal plasma particles that are injected into the diffusive shock acceleration process (this is known as the injection\nproblem). For electron injection in quasi-perpendicular shocks, the shock surfing acceleration has been investigated\nas an injection mechanism or even as an efficient acceleration mechanism (Hoshino 2001; McClements et al. 2001;\nHoshino & Shimada 2002). However, several researchers have recently shown that the shock surfing acceleration process is in fact inefficient in 2D (e.g., Dieckmann & Shukla 2006; Ohira & Takahara 2007; Umeda et al. 2008) and that\n\n\fWEAKLY MAGNETIZED COLLISIONLESS SHOCKS\n\n3\n\nit is efficient in 1D because of the symmetry of the system. Instead, Amano & Hoshino (2009) showed that another\nacceleration process can operate in 2D in which a fraction of electrons are reflected in the foot region by small-scale\nelectrostatic waves generated by the Buneman instability. They are then accelerated by the motional electric field as\nwell as being directly accelerated by the electric field when they resonate with the electrostatic waves. Electrons can\nbe accelerated up to about the upstream ion bulk energy by this mechanism. Thus, multidimensional effects can play\nan essential role in the acceleration/injection mechanism.\nIn addition, collisionless shocks can be sites of magnetic field amplification/generation. Recent X-ray observations\nsuggest that magnetic fields of the order of hundreds of microgauss or even milligauss may be generated in the vicinity\nof SNR shocks (Vink & Laming 2003; V\u00f6lk et al. 2005; Uchiyama 2007). Several mechanisms have been proposed\nfor this magnetic field amplification, including a nonresonant instability driven by high-energy particles accelerated\nin shocks (Bell 2004) and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence behind shocks (Giacalone & Jokipii 2007; Inoue et al.\n2009). The mechanism may be related with the microscopic kinetic processes associated with shock formation itself;\nit should in principle be possible to investigate this by performing large-scale PIC simulations.\nIn this study, we investigate the formation and structure of perpendicular shocks for very low \u03c3 and the processes responsible for particle acceleration and magnetic field generation by performing 2D PIC simulation, which\ncan appropriately model the beam\u2013Weibel instability. Because of the capability of the computer, we used a reduced\nion-to-electron mass ratio and a shock speed (Vsh \u223c 0.3c, where c is the speed of light) that is much higher than\nrealistic ones for SNRs (Vsh \u223c 0.01c) in the simulation.\n2. METHOD\n\nWe investigated collisionless shocks in electron\u2013ion plasmas with weak background magnetic fields by performing a\n2D PIC simulation. The simulation code is a relativistic, electromagnetic, PIC code with two spatial and three velocity\ndimensions developed based on a standard method described by Birdsall & Langdon (1991). The basic equations of\nthe simulation are Maxwell's equations and the (relativistic) equation of motion for particles. In the following, we\n\u22121\nregard the simulation plane as the x\u2212y plane and we take the z-axis to be perpendicular to the plane. We take \u03c4 = \u03c9pe\n\u22121\n2\n1/2\nto be the unit of time and the electron skin depth \u03bbe = c\u03c9pe to be the unit of length, where \u03c9pe \u2261 (4\u03c0ne0 e /me )\nis\nthe electron plasma frequency defined for the electron number density in the far upstream region, ne0 . The units for\nelectric and magnetic fields are E\u2217 = B\u2217 = c(4\u03c0ne0 me )1/2 .\nIn the simulation, a collisionless shock is driven according to the \"injection method.\" There are two walls, one on the\nleft-hand side (smaller x) and the other on the right-hand side (larger x) of the simulation box and these walls reflect\nparticles specularly. Initially, both electrons and ions are loaded uniformly in the region between the two walls with a\nbulk velocity of V in the +x-direction. The electrons and ions have equal temperatures in the upstream region. In the\nearly stages of the simulation, particles near the right wall are reflected by the wall and then interact with incoming\nparticles (i.e., the upstream plasma). This interaction generates some instability and eventually a collisionless shock\nforms. The frame of the simulation is the rest frame of the shock downstream; the shock propagates from right to left\nin the downstream rest frame.\nWe consider a perpendicular shock in this paper; the initial magnetic field, B0 , is in the y-direction (i.e., in the\nplane) and its strength is determined by the sigma. However, since the shock speed is unknown before performing the\nsimulation, in the following, the sigma is defined in the simulation frame with an upstream bulk velocity V instead of\nthe shock speed Vsh as\nB02 /8\u03c0\n;\n(2)\n\u03c3\u0303 \u2261\nne0 (me + mi )V 2 /2\nhowever, the difference between these two sigmas is not large. With this definition of the sigma, the magnetic\n1/2\nfield strength in the simulation frame is given by B0 = [(1 + mi /me )\u03c3\u0303] (V /c)B\u2217 . The initial electric field, E0 , is\ndetermined so that it vanishes in the plasma rest frame (i.e., the upstream frame); this requirement causes the motional\nelectric field in the simulation frame, E0 = \u2212V B0 /c, in the z-direction. The boundary conditions for both the particles\nand the electromagnetic field are periodic in the y-direction.\n3. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS\n\nWe performed a simulation for a sigma of \u03c3\u0303 = 10\u22124 . As mentioned above, we use a reduced ion mass of mi = 30me\nand a bulk velocity of V = 0.25c. The grid size is Nx \u00d7 Ny = 16384 \u00d7 1024 and there are \u223c 40 particles per cell per\nspecies. The physical dimensions of the simulation box are Lx \u00d7 Ly = 3200\u03bbe \u00d7 200\u03bbe and thus the size of a cell is\n\u2206x = \u2206y \u223c 0.2\u03bbe . The electron and ion temperatures are equal and are given by kB T /me c2 = 1.25 \u00d7 10\u22123 , where\nkB is the Boltzmann constant. The thermal velocities are thus given by ae = (2kB T /me )1/2 = 0.05c for the electrons\nand ai = 9.13 \u00d7 10\u22123 c for the ions. For these parameters, we have \u03c9ce /\u03c9pe = B0 /B\u2217 \u223c 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22122 , the Alfv\u00e9n speed\nvA \u223c 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 c (thus, M \u0303A \u2261 V /vA = 100), and the plasma beta \u03b2 \u223c 26 (i.e., it is a high-beta plasma). The Larmor\nradii of the electrons and ions calculated for the background field and the upstream bulk velocity are rg,e = 18\u03bbe and\nrg,i = 535\u03bbe , respectively.\n3.1. Overall structure\n\nFigure 1 shows the time evolution of the ion number density averaged over the y-direction. The shock transition\nregion, or the \"shock front\", appears as a steep increase in the number density. The shock structure and its propagation\n\n\f4\n\nKATO AND TAKABE\n\nspeed abruptly change around \u03c9pe t \u223c 3000. This is because the shock structure undergoes a transition from an\nunmagnetized shock to a magnetized shock. Indeed, the structure for \u03c9pe t < 2000 is essentially the same as those of\nWeibel-mediated shocks in unmagnetized plasmas (Kato & Takabe 2008), as discussed below. The transition time is\nof the order of the gyration time of the ions in the background field, Tg \u2261 2\u03c0/\u03c9ci, where \u03c9ci \u2261 eB0 /mi c is the ion\ncyclotron frequency. For the unmagnetized shock (1500 < \u03c9pe t < 2000), the shock speed measured in the downstream\nframe is Vsh,d \u223c \u22120.16c. For the magnetized shock (\u03c9pe t > 4000), it becomes Vsh,d \u223c \u22120.08c and that in the upstream\nframe and the Alfv\u00e9n Mach number are given by Vsh \u223c \u22120.33c and MA \u223c 130, respectively. Thus, the sigma defined\nfor the shock velocity is given by \u03c3 = 5.9 \u00d7 10\u22125 in this case. The shock speeds obtained here may have small\nuncertainties because they were obtained by eye-fitting the figure and also they may not be in the steady state yet.\nSince the formation of an unmagnetized shock is a consequence of the initial conditions and we are interested in the\nmagnetized shock in this study, we mainly focus on the magnetized shock below. We discuss the unmagnetized shock\nat the end of this section.\n\nFig. 1.- Time development of the ion number density averaged over the y-direction for the simulation with an upstream bulk velocity\nof V = 0.25c and a sigma parameter of \u03c3\u0303 = 10\u22124 . The color indicates the number density normalized by that in the far upstream ne0 . The\n\u22121\nhorizontal and vertical axes respectively represent x (in units of electron skin depth \u03bbe ) and time (in units of the electron plasma time \u03c9pe\n).\nThe shock structure and its propagation speed change abruptly around \u03c9pe t \u223c 3000 due to the transition from an unmagnetized shock to a\nmagnetized shock. The arrows indicate the obtained shock speeds for the unmagnetized shock (Vsh,d \u223c \u22120.16c) and the magnetized shock\n(Vsh,d \u223c \u22120.08c).\n\nFigure 1 shows that the shock wave almost reaches steady state near the end of the simulation (\u03c9pe t \u223c 8000). Figure\n2 shows the ion number density at \u03c9pe t = 8000. (Hereafter, we discuss the results at this time unless otherwise stated.)\nThe upstream plasma flows from left to right and moves through the transition region (2350 < x/\u03bbe < 2550) and then\nreaches the downstream state. (The structure in Fig. 1 in x > 2700\u03bbe is an artifact due to the boundary and so in\nthe following we discuss the structure in x < 2700\u03bbe .) Note that there are filamentary structures, which cannot be\nobserved in 1D simulations, in the upstream leading edge of the shock transition region (x \u223c 2400\u03bbe ). The filament\nradius is typically approximately equal to the ion inertial length, which is the same as those in the \"Weibel-mediated\"\nshocks in unmagnetized electron\u2013ion plasmas (Kato & Takabe 2008). Then, behind them, there is a highly fluctuating\nhigh-density region. In the downstream region (x > 2550\u03bbe ), the number density becomes almost homogeneous.\nFigures 3(a) and (b) show profiles of the ion number density and the magnetic field strength averaged over the\ny-direction, respectively. It shows that the number density increases rapidly in the transition region and after the\ntransition region it approaches \u223c 4 times the upstream value. Figure 3(b) shows the root mean square of each\n\n\fWEAKLY MAGNETIZED COLLISIONLESS SHOCKS\n\n5\n\nFig. 2.- Ion number density at \u03c9pe t = 8000. The horizontal and vertical axes represent x and y, respectively. The left- and right-hand\nsides are upstream and downstream of the shock, respectively. Many filamentary structures can be seen in the shock transition region\n(2350 < x/\u03bbe < 2550).\n\nmagnetic field component together with the total magnetic field strength. This structure is similar to the well-known\nstructure of supercritical perpendicular shocks in 1D; the 'ramp' is at x \u223c 2400\u03bbe and there is an extended 'foot'\nregion in x < 2400\u03bbe as well as an 'overshoot' region in 2400 < x/\u03bbe < 2470. It is evident that strong magnetic fields\nare generated in both the shock transition region (or the overshoot) and the downstream region. The energy density\nof the magnetic field reaches \u223c 15% of the upstream bulk kinetic energy density (measured in the downstream rest\nframe) in the shock transition region and \u223c 2% in the downstream region. It is notable that Bx and Bz , which are\ngenerated by the current filaments of the ion-beam\u2013Weibel instability (see below), are comparable with By , which is\nmostly generated by the upstream background field. These Bx and Bz fields as well as the By field contribute to the\ndissipation of the shock. Since these filaments and the magnetic field are never generated in 1D simulations, the shock\nstructure may differ significantly from those in 1D cases.\n\nFig. 3.- Profiles of (a) the ion number density normalized by the upstream density ne0 and (b) the root mean square of each magnetic\nfield component (Bx , blue curve; By , red curve; Bz , green curve) and that of the total strength (|B|, dashed black curve), where all the\ncomponents are normalized by the upstream background field B0 .\n\nFigure 4 shows phase-space plots of the electrons and the ions. Here, each component of the four velocities (uj =\n\u03b3vj /c, where j = x, y, z and \u03b3 \u2261 (1 \u2212 v 2 /c2 )\u22121/2 is the Lorentz factor of the particle) are plotted as a function of\n\n\f6\n\nKATO AND TAKABE\n\nthe x-coordinate. Both electrons and ions from upstream are mostly dissipated and isotropically thermalized through\nthe transition region (2300\u03bbe < x < 2450\u03bbe ). It is observed that a fraction of ions are reflected at x \u223c 2400\u03bbe (i.e.,\nthe ramp) and then gyrate back downstream with slight acceleration forming the foot structure. This is a well-known\ncharacteristic of supercritical shocks and has been observed in many numerical simulations (e.g., Leroy 1981; Burgess\n1989). In contrast, the electrons have no prominent substructures in phase space.\n\nFig. 4.- Phase-space plots of electrons (left panel) and ions (right panel). The (from top to bottom) x, y, and z components of the\nfour velocities are shown in each panel. Both species are mostly thermalized within the shock transition region. A fraction of the incoming\nions are reflected at x \u223c 2400\u03bbe .\n\n3.2. Foot dynamics\n\nFigure 5 shows the distribution of the ion kinetic energy measured in the upstream frame, Ekin,u = (\u03b3u \u22121)mc2 , where\n\u03b3u is the particle Lorentz factor measured in the upstream frame, as a function of the x-coordinate (in the downstream\nframe) at \u03c9pe t = 8000. In this figure, the incoming and reflected ions in the foot region (2200 < x/\u03bbe < 2400) can\nbe clearly distinguished from each other using a threshold energy of, for example, Ekin,u /me c2 = 1: the reflected ions\nwith Ekin,u /me c2 > 1 and the incoming ions with Ekim,u /me c2 < 1. The reflected ions are further divided into two\npopulations: those streaming upstream measured in the shock rest frame and those streaming downstream. Thus, we\ncan investigate the foot dynamics on the basis of a simple fluid model that consists of a single electron fluid and three\nion fluids (incoming ions, reflected ions streaming upstream, and those streaming downstream), which is similar to the\nmodel used in Leroy (1983). For convenience, we denote the electrons, the incoming ions, the reflected ions streaming\nupstream, and those streaming downstream by the symbols e, I, R\u2212 , and R+ , respectively.\n\nFig. 5.- Kinetic energy of the ions measured in the upstream frame.\n\nFigures 6(a) and (b) show the mean velocity of each fluid component in the x- and z-directions and Fig. 6(c) shows\nthe number densities normalized by the upstream number density. In the downstream region (x > 2400\u03bbe ), only the\nvalues for all the ions are shown because classifying the ions by the above method is meaningless in that region. It\nshows that the mean velocities and the number density of all electrons (thick curves) and for all ions (dashed white\ncurves) agree well with each other in both the upstream and downstream regions, indicating that the massless electron\nfluid model (Leroy 1983) holds well, at least on average, even in this high Mach number and low ion-to-electron mass\nratio case.\n\n\fWEAKLY MAGNETIZED COLLISIONLESS SHOCKS\n0.3\n\n(a)\n\n7\n\nIncoming ions\n\n0.2\nc /\n\n0.1\n\nV\n\nx\n\nReflected ions (+)\n\nTotal electrons and ions\n\n0.0\n-0.1\n\nReflected ions (-)\n\n-0.2\n\n0.1\n\n(b)\n\n0.0\n\nz\n\n-0.2\n\nV\n\nc /\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.3\n-0.4\n-0.5\n\n8\n\n(c)\n\n0e\n\n6\n\nn / n\n\n4\n2\n0\n2300\n\n2400\n\nx /\n\n2500\n\n\u03bbe\n\n2600\n\n2700\n\nFig. 6.- Profiles of the mean velocities in the (a) x- and (b) z-directions, and (c) the mean number densities normalized by the upstream\nnumber density.\n\n3.2.1. Electrostatic instabilities and heating\n\nThe local temperatures of the respective components were calculated using the mean velocities obtained above and\nthey are plotted in Fig. 7. It shows that in the foot region, the electrons are heated in two steps: the first step in\nx \u2264 2350\u03bbe (region 1) and the second step in 2350 \u2264 x/\u03bbe \u2264 2400 (region 2). The incoming ions are also heated in region\n2. This sequential electron heating process together with the ion heating suggests that the model for very high Mach\nnumber shocks proposed by Papadopoulos (1988) is valid in the foot region, in which the incoming electrons are first\n\n\f8\n\nKATO AND TAKABE\n\nheated by the Buneman instability (Buneman 1958) for reflected ions (Auer et al. 1971) and subsequently, after the\nelectrons have been heated to a certain temperature, they are further heated by the ion-acoustic instability for incoming\nions. The latter instability can also heat the ions. This process has been studied by Cargill & Papadopoulos (1988)\nfor MA \u223c 50 and 500 with hybrid simulations with a phenomenological resistivity and also by Shimada & Hoshino\n(2000) for MA \u223c 10.5 with 1D PIC simulations.\n1\nIons (total)\n\nReflected ions (+)\n\nElectrons (total)\n\n0.1\n\ncem / T\n\n2\n\nReflected ions (-)\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\nIncoming ions\n\n2300\n\n2400\nx /\n\n\u03bbe\n\n2500\n\n2600\n\n2700\n\nFig. 7.- Temperature profile of each component. Both incoming electrons (thick solid curve) and incoming ions (thin solid curve) are\nheated in the foot region (x < 2400\u03bbe ).\n\nThis heating process is expected to operate in very high Mach number shocks and so it should also operate in the\npresent case (MA \u223c 130). Figure 8 shows several quantities of each ion component obtained from Figs. 6 and 7;\nspecifically, it shows profiles of the mean velocity relative to the electron velocity in the x-direction, the electron-toion temperature ratio, and the number density normalized by the local electron number density ne (x). In region 1\n(x < 2350\u03bbe ), the reflected ions streaming upstream have a significantly higher velocity relative to the electrons than\nthe electron thermal velocity. On the other hand, in region 2 (x > 2350\u03bbe ), the electron-to-ion temperature ratio for\nthe incoming ions increases to a large value and also the incoming ion velocity relative to the electron velocity becomes\nlarge due to the large deceleration of the electrons [see Fig. 6(a)] so that it becomes higher than the ion-acoustic speed,\ncs \u2261 (kB Te /mi )1/2 . These conditions are indeed preferable to the Buneman instability in region 1 and the ion-acoustic\ninstability in region 2.\nHere, we show the instabilities that operate in the foot region by performing local linear analysis with the fluid quantities (namely, the mean velocities, the number densities, and the temperatures shown in Figs. 6 and 7).

(4) instead of that for magnetized plasmas because the magnetic field is sufficiently\nweak in the\n\u221a\n2\npresent case; the condition for the unmagnetized approximation is given by k 2 \u226b kcs\nwhere kcs \u2261 2|\u03c9cs |/as ; in other\nwords, for all species, the wavelength is much smaller than the Larmor radius defined for the thermal velocity. As\nshown below, the wavenumbers of the instabilities are typically kc/\u03c9pe > 3 and kcs c/\u03c9pe is \u223c 0.5 for electrons, \u223c 0.15\nfor incoming ions, and \u223c 0.01 for reflected ions in the foot region. Therefore, the unmagnetized approximation can be\nused in this case.\nWhen performing the linear analysis with the local quantities at x = 2300\u03bbe , we found an unstable electrostatic\nmode whose wavenumber (kx \u223c 3.5\u03c9pe /c) and frequency (\u03c9 \u2032 \u223c 0.048\u03c9pe in the rest frame of the reflected ions R\u2212 ) are\nsimilar to those of the Buneman instability between electrons and reflected ions streaming upstream (kx \u223c 2.9\u03c9pe/c\nand \u03c9 \u2032 \u223c 0.05\u03c9pe in the rest frame of R\u2212 ). However, the obtained growth rate (\u03b3 \u223c 0.0057\u03c9pe) is one order of\nmagnitude smaller than the typical growth rate of the Buneman instability (\u03b3 \u223c 0.087\u03c9pe). This is because of the\nrelatively high temperature of the reflected ions streaming upstream, TR\u2212 , as is shown in Fig. 7, while the ordinary\nBuneman instability assumes that both species are cold. Figure 9 shows the maximum linear growth rates of this\nmode together with their wavenumbers calculated for the quantities at x = 2300\u03bbe while varying TR\u2212 . When TR\u2212\napproaches zero, the growth rate becomes large and approaches to a typical value for the Buneman instability. Thus,\nwe regard this mode as a Buneman instability between the electrons and the reflected ions streaming upstream with\na reduction in the growth rate due to the relatively high temperature of the reflected ions.\nOn the other hand, we found another unstable electrostatic mode at x \u223c 2350\u03bbe . This mode has a maximum growth\nrate \u03b3max \u223c 0.02\u03c9pe and a frequency \u03c9 \u223c 0.52\u03c9pe at kx \u223c 4.85\u03c9pe/c. This leads to a phase velocity of \u223c \u22120.017c in\nthe incoming ion rest frame. For the same parameters, the dispersion relation of the ion-acoustic instability (Ichimaru\n1973) between electrons and incoming ions gives \u03b3max \u223c 0.015\u03c9pe at kx \u223c 4.0\u03c9pe /c and a phase speed of cs \u223c \u22120.016c\nin the incoming ions rest frame. Both agree well with each other and thus we regard this mode as an ion-acoustic\ninstability between electrons and incoming ions.\nFigure 10 summarizes the results for this local linear analysis over the foot region. The Buneman instability develops\nupstream of the foot region (x \u2264 2325\u03bbe ), whereas the ion-acoustic instability dominates downstream of the foot region\n(x \u2265 2325\u03bbe ). This feature is consistent with the evolution of the electron and incoming ion temperatures shown in\nFig. 7; the electrons are first heated by the Buneman instability and then both electrons and incoming ions are heated\nby the ion-acoustic instability. Note that there is a region where both instabilities can coexist (2312 \u2264 x/\u03bbe \u2264 2325).\nSince both the Buneman and the ion-acoustic instabilities are electrostatic modes, they are always associated with\nthe charge density \u03c1 and can be investigated through it. Figures 11(a) and (b) show the charge density and its power\nspectrum in two rectangular areas in the foot region, namely x \u223c 2300\u03bbe (where the Buneman instability dominates)\nand x \u223c 2350\u03bbe (where the ion-acoustic instability dominates), respectively. The peak positions of these power spectra\nagree well with the wavenumbers for the maximum growth rates obtained by the linear theory shown in Fig. 10.\nNote that both spectra are not concentrated on the kx -axis but extend in the ky -direction. This results in the wavy\nappearance of both modes in real space (left panels) and is a well-known characteristic of both instabilities in multiple\ndimensions.\n3.2.2. Filamentary structures\n\nAs mentioned above, the ion number density in the foot region (Fig. 2) contains many filamentary structures.\nFigure 12 shows that these filaments are associated with current filaments and filamentary magnetic fields. These\nfilaments are similar to those observed in unmagnetized shocks, which are generated by the beam-Weibel instability.\nIn our previous papers, we showed that the ion beam\u2013Weibel instability develops and generates currents filaments\neven for nonrelativistic flow speeds (Kato & Takabe 2008, 2010). Therefore, it is plausible that these filaments are\ngenerated by the ion beam-Weibel instability.

The mode is unstable in the foot region and it grows at a\ncomparable growth rate to those of electrostatic modes (see Fig. 10). The wavenumber obtained in the linear analysis\nnear x = 2360\u03bbe is typically ky \u223c 0.8; this value agrees well with the simulation result shown in Fig.12(d). Note that\nthe real frequency of the mode (dotted curve) is zero; that is, it is a purely growing mode.\nThis mode can be regarded as an ion beam-Weibel instability. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 13, the maximum growth\nrate and the wave number essentially agree with those obtained from the dispersion relation for the beam-Weibel\ninstability using the unmagnetized approximation:\nh\ni\nX\n2\n\u03c9 2 \u2212 (kc)2 +\n\u03c9ps\n\u03b1s + 2\u1e7cs2 (1 + \u03b1s ) = 0,\n(18)\ns\n\nwhere \u1e7cs is taken to be either \u1e7csx (shown by the dashed curves) or \u1e7csz (the dot-dashed curves) and s = e, I, R\u2212 , R+ .\n\n\fWEAKLY MAGNETIZED COLLISIONLESS SHOCKS\n\n13\n\nFig. 11.- Charge density (left panels) and its power spectrum (right panels): around (a) x \u223c 2300\u03bbe and (b) x \u223c 2350\u03bbe . The\nportions where the power is strong are consistent with the linear theory of (a) the Buneman instability and (b) the ion-acoustic instability,\nrespectively.\n\nThus, it can be concluded that the filamentary structure in the foot region is generated by the ion beam-Weibel\ninstability. The strong magnetic field generated by the instability would contribute to the thermalization of the\nincoming ions immediately upstream of the ramp (see Fig. 7).\n3.3. Downstream temperature and jump condition\n\nIn the downstream region, we obtain a temperature ratio of Te /Ti \u223c 0.38 from Fig. 7. Thus, the ratio is significantly\nsmaller than unity, although it is still much larger than those observed in several SNRs [e.g., Te /Tp < 0.07 in SN1006;\n\n\f14\n\nKATO AND TAKABE\n\nFig. 12.- (a) Ion number density, (b) magnetic field Bz , and (c) current density in the x-direction, Jx , around x \u223c 2375\u03bbe . (d) Power\nspectrum of Jx calculated in the region 2362.5 < x/\u03bbe < 2385.5.\n\nGhavamian et al. (2002).]\nFigure 14 shows the kinetic energy distributions of the electrons and the ions in a rectangular downstream region\n(2624\u03bbe < x < 2656\u03bbe ). Both distributions are fitted very well with the (3D and relativistic) Maxwellian distributions\n(e.g., Landau & Lifshitz 1980)\nf (\u03b3)d\u03b3 \u221d \u03b3(\u03b3 2 \u2212 1)1/2 exp(\u2212\u03b3mc2 /kB T )d\u03b3\n(19)\n\nwith temperatures kB Te /me c2 = 0.14 (for the electrons) and kB Ti /me c2 = 0.42 (for the ions) for Ekin /me c2 < 2.\nThese temperatures again give a low temperature ratio of Te /Ti \u223c 0.33. When the upstream bulk kinetic energy\nis completely dissipated into thermal energy and the electron and the ions are in equipartition, the temperature is\ngiven by kB T /me c2 \u223c 0.32 for both species. On the other hand, when the electrons and the ions are thermalized\nseparately, their temperatures are kB Te /me c2 = 0.021 and kB Ti /me c2 = 0.63, respectively. The ion distribution has\na suprathermal tail for Ekin /me c2 > 2. As shown in the next subsection, these suprathermal ions originate from\nthe reflected ions in the foot region. In contrast, neither a suprathermal tail nor an accelerated population is clearly\nobserved in the electron distribution.\nUsing the above results, the shock jump conditions are calculated as follows. In the shock rest frame, the upstream\nflow velocity V1 and the downstream flow velocity V2 are given by V1 = 0.33c and V2 = 0.084c, respectively. Thus, we\nhave V1 /V2 \u223c 3.9, N2 /N1 \u223c 4.1, and (kB (Te + Ti )/mi )1/2 \u223c 0.14c, where N1 (= ne0 ) and N2 are the number densities\nin the upstream and downstream regions, respectively. On the other hand, the MHD Rankine\u2013Hugoniot relations\n(e.g., Tidman & Krall 1971) give V1 /V2 = N2 /N1 \u223c 4 and (kB (Te + Ti )/mi )1/2 \u223c 0.15c in the high Mach number\nlimit. Hence, the simulation results agree very well with the MHD Rankin\u2013Hugoniot relations. Even although, in the\ndownstream region, the magnetic field reaches \u223c 15 times the upstream fields [see Fig. 3(b)], the plasma beta is still\nhigh (\u03b2 \u223c 25) and the magnetic pressure is negligible for the jump condition.\n3.4. Acceleration of reflected ions\n\nAs Fig. 14 shows, a fraction of the ions are slightly accelerated to Ekin /me c2 \u223c 3 \u2212 6 (measured in the downstream\nframe) and form suprathermal populations. Figure 15(a) shows the trajectories of two typical accelerated ions (red and\n\n\fWEAKLY MAGNETIZED COLLISIONLESS SHOCKS\n\n15\n\n-2\n\n2.5x10\n\n(a)\n\n\u03c9\n\nep\n\n2.0\n\n/\n\n1.5\n\nxam\n\n\u03b3\n\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n1.2\n1.0\nep\n\n\u03c9\n\n(b)\n\n0.8\n\ny\n\n/ c k\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n2250\n\n2300\nx /\n\n\u03bbe\n\n2350\n\n2400\n\nFig. 13.- (a) The linear growth rate and (b) wavenumber of the most unstable mode of the electromagnetic instability with the wave\nvectors parallel to the background magnetic field (i.e., in the y-direction) (solid curves). The real frequency is shown by the dotted curve\nin the panel (a), which shows that the mode is a purely growing mode. Those for the ion beam-Weibel instability are shown by the dashed\ncurves (for \u1e7csx ) and dot-dashed curves (for \u1e7csz ), respectively.\n\nblue curves) together with that of a non-accelerated ion (green curve). It is clear that accelerated ions are reflected\nat the shock front (i.e., the ramp) and go around the upstream region, whereas non-accelerated ions are directly\ntransmitted downstream. Figure 15(b) shows the kinetic energy history of the three ions measured in the downstream\nframe. It reveals that the kinetic energies of the ions increase while they are in the upstream region. This is simply\nacceleration by the motional electric field Ez = \u2212Vx By /c in the downstream frame while they are gyrating in the\nfoot region (Auer et al. 1971; Phillips & Robson 1972) after specular reflection at the shock front (Paschmann et al.\n1982; Gosling et al. 1982; Schwartz et al. 1983). As Fig. 15(c) shows, the ions are accelerated when propagating in\nthe \u2212z-direction. This process can be understand more clearly in the upstream frame where there is (essentially) only\na background magnetic field and no motional electric field. Figure 15(d) shows the same kinetic energy histories as\nFig. 15(b) but measured in the upstream frame. It shows that the ions gain energy at the reflection and subsequently\ntheir kinetic energy remains almost constant. Thus, the ion acceleration is simply due to reflection at the ramp.\n3.5. Currents and magnetic field\nFigure 16 shows each component of the current density and the magnetic field. The upstream background field,\nwhich is in the y direction, is compressed in the shock transition region as in the 1D simulations, although it fluctuates\nconsiderably in the present case. As discussed above, many current filaments exist in the foot region of the shock in Jx\nand Jz ; the filamentary structures observed in the ion number density in Fig. 2 indicate the presence of these current\nfilaments. The filaments generate a magnetic field in the same way as a Weibel-mediated shock in unmagnetized\nplasmas except that in the present cases Bx and By components are generated by the current filaments in addition to\nthe Bz component because the background field deflects the particles in the z-direction and the current filaments can\nhave a Jz component as well as a Jx component.\nFigure 17 shows the magnetic field strength normalized by the upstream background magnetic field, |B|/B0 . There\nare some strong, highly tangled magnetic fields in the transition region (|B|/B0 \u223c 40) and the downstream region\n(|B|/B0 \u223c 15, which is much larger than the magnetic field strength when merely compressed \u223c 4). Figure 18 shows\nenlargements of the current density in the z direction, Jz , and the magnetic field strength |B| in a rectangular area\nin the downstream region (2550\u03bbe < x < 2700\u03bbe and 50\u03bbe < y < 200\u03bbe ). It is evident that the downstream tangled\nmagnetic field is mainly generated by the current filaments in Jz . The filaments have typical sizes of \u223c 2 \u2212 4\u03bbi , where\n\n\f16\n\nKATO AND TAKABE\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n)nikE(N\n\nIons\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\nElectrons\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n2\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nEkin / mec\n\nFig. 14.- Kinetic energy distributions of the electrons and the ions measured in the downstream frame (solid histograms) normalized\nby the electron rest mass energy in the downstream region within 2624\u03bbe < x < 2656\u03bbe . The dashed and dotted curves are the Maxwellian\ndistributions with temperatures of kB Te /me c2 = 0.14 for electrons and kB Ti /me c2 = 0.42 for ions, respectively.\n\n\u03bbi \u2261 (mi /me )1/2 \u03bbe is the ion inertial length, which is slightly larger than the filament size in the foot region. This\ncan be explained by current filaments coalescing downstream of the foot region. Some of the current filaments have a\ncomplex coaxial structure in that they are surrounded by return and anti-return currents.\nCoalescence of current filaments that carry a current in the x-direction in the foot region is inhibited due to the\ndimensionality of the simulation, while current filaments in the z-direction can merge with each other (c.f. Morse 1971;\nLee & Lampe 1973; Kato 2005). Furthermore, the current filaments in the z-direction are not affected by instabilities\nin the current direction, such as the kink instability. Therefore, the current structures in the foot and downstream\nregions may still differ in three dimensions.\n3.6. Early evolution\n\nIt is interesting to note the evolution of the system before the effect of the background magnetic field becomes\n\u22121\nsignificant (i.e., t \u2264 \u03a9\u22121\n\u223c 2000\u03c9pe\n). In this period, the plasma is effectively unmagnetized and another kind of\ni\nshock, namely an unmagnetized shock, appears. Figures 19 and 20 respectively show the evolution of the ions in the\nx\u2013ux phase space and that of the ion number density. At a very early time (\u03c9pe t = 500), the incoming ions and\nthe ions reflected by the wall at x = 3000\u03bbe form a counterstreaming beam system and the number density in the\noverlapping region simply becomes twice the upstream number density. The two populations then start to interact\n(1000 \u2264 \u03c9pe t \u2264 2000) and the density on the right side of the overlapping region increases. As shown below, this\ninteraction is due to the magnetic field generated by the ion beam\u2013Weibel instability in the overlapping region that\ndeflects the ions; this provides a kind of dissipation mechanism. At a later time (3000 \u2264 \u03c9pe t \u2264 4000), the effect of\nthe background magnetic field becomes important and incoming ions start to accumulate around x \u223c 2775\u03bbe . Most\nof the ions that are initially reflected by the wall gyrate back downstream due to the background magnetic field by\n\u03c9pe t = 3000. Instead, at \u03c9pe t = 4000, another reflected ion population appears around x = 2700\u03bbe ; the ions in this\npopulation have been newly reflected at the 'ramp' (x \u223c 2750\u03bbe ). Thus, the structure changes from an unmagnetized\nshock to a magnetized one around that time.\nFigure 21 shows the ion number density, the x-component of the current density Jx , and the z-component of the\nmagnetic field Bz at \u03c9pe t = 2000. It is evident that many current filaments are generated in the interacting region and\ngenerate a strong magnetic field around themselves. A filamentary structure is also observed in the number density\ncorresponding to the current filaments. These current filaments are generated by the ion beam-Weibel instability\nbetween the counterstreaming ion populations. The generated magnetic field provides the dissipation mechanism for the\nions to form the unmagnetized shock.

Some of the current filaments have a coaxial structure.\n\n\fWEAKLY MAGNETIZED COLLISIONLESS SHOCKS\n\n19\n\nFig. 19.- x\u2013ux phase space plots of the ions in the early evolution.

The ions are almost completely isotropized and form a ring-like\ndistribution in the ux -uy plane far downstream (2900 < x/\u03bbe < 3000). Since the beam-Weibel instability generates\nonly the z-component of the magnetic field in this 2D configuration, the magnetic field deflects the ions only in the\nux -uy plane. However, in three dimensions, the generated magnetic field can have the y-component and the ions can\nbe deflected in all directions, resulting in three-dimensional dissipation.\nThe dissipated ions form the downstream region of the shock and the shock structure propagates upstream at an\nalmost constant speed, as shown in Fig. 1 for 1500 \u2264 \u03c9pe t \u2264 2000. In the present simulation, this Weibel-mediated\nshock disappears when the effect of the background magnetic field becomes significant at later times. However, this\nshock can propagate steadily upstream when there is no background field (Kato & Takabe 2008).\n4. DISCUSSION\n\n\f20\n\nKATO AND TAKABE\n\nFig. 20.- Time evolution of the ion number density for \u03c9pe t = 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, and 4000.\n\nIn the previous section it was found that the filamentary structures in our simulation are generated by the ion beam\u2013\nWeibel instability in the foot region. Similar structures have been found in the foot or overshoot region in 2D PIC\nor hybrid simulations with lower Mach numbers. There are two different causes for these structures: the emission of\nwhistler waves at the ramp (Krauss-Varban et al. 1995; Hellinger et al. 2007; Lemb\u00e8ge et al. 2009) and the emission\nof Alfv\u00e9n waves due to the Alfv\u00e9n ion cyclotron instability, resulting in a structure called rippling (Winske & Quest\n1988; Lowe & Burgess 2003). Since these are associated with waves generated at the ramp or the overshoot and which\nthen propagate upstream, these processes could also be related to the filamentary structures in our simulation. The\nwavenumber range of the whistler wave is given by (Ichimaru 1973):\n\u0012\n\u00132\nne0 kc\n4me\n\u226a\n\u226a 1,\n(20)\nmi\nne \u03c9pe\nwhere ne is the local electron number density at which the whistler wave exists and ne0 and \u03c9pe are defined for the\nfar upstream. The left-hand side is \u223c 0.133 in our simulation and if we take ne /ne0 \u223c 2 [Fig. 6(c)] and kc/\u03c9pe \u223c 1\n[Fig. 12(d)] as typical values, the above condition is (marginally) satisfied. However, if the structure is related with\n(standing) whistler waves, its group velocity must be greater than the shock speed (in the upstream frame):\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\nB\nne\n|\u03c9ce | kc2\n\u2202\u03c9\n> Vsh ,\n(21)\n=2\nvg =\n\u2202k\nB0 ne0\n\u03c9pe \u03c9pe\nwhere B0 and \u03c9ce are defined for the far upstream, whereas B is the local value. [Here, we neglect the dependence\nof the propagation angle and hence it is just a necessary condition; c.f., Krauss-Varban et al. (1995).] This condition\ncan be rewritten as\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121 \u0012\n\u00131/2\nB\nne\nmi\nkc\nMA < 2\n.\n(22)\nB0 ne0\nme\n\u03c9pe\nIn our simulation, the right-hand side is \u223c 10 \u2212 30, whereas the left-hand side is \u223c 130. Thus, the filamentary\nstructure observed in our simulation does not originate from whistler wave emission. On the other hand, the result of\nthe simulation by Lemb\u00e8ge et al. (2009) with mi /me = 400 satisfies this condition if B/B0 \u223c ne /ne0 ; the right-hand\nside is \u223c 2kc/\u03c9pi \u223c 14.6, whereas the left-hand side is \u223c 4.93. Assuming kc/\u03c9pe \u223c 1 and B \u221d ne , a rough condition\nfor the Alfv\u00e9n Mach number is given by\nMA < 2(mi /me )1/2 .\n(23)\nThis gives MA \u2264 11 for the mass ratio in our simulation (mi /me = 30) and MA \u2264 86 for the real mass ratio of\nmi /me = 1836. The rippling (Winske & Quest 1988; Lowe & Burgess 2003) cannot be the cause of the filamentary\nstructure in our simulation because (1) the rippling develops in the overshoot region, whereas the filamentary structure\nin our simulation develops in the foot region; (2) the wavelength observed in our simulation (\u03bb \u223c 8\u03bbe ) is smaller than\nthat of Alfv\u00e9n waves (\u03bbA > 3\u03bbi \u223c 16\u03bbe for mi /me = 30); and (3) the Alfv\u00e9n speed in the foot is smaller than the shock\nspeed. Nevertheless, comparison of Fig. 16 with the figures in Winske & Quest (1988) reveals that the structures\nof the magnetic field and the number density at and behind the overshoot are similar to each other. Therefore, the\n\n\fWEAKLY MAGNETIZED COLLISIONLESS SHOCKS\n\n21\n\nFig. 21.- (a) The ion number density, (b) the x-component of the current density, and (c) the z-component of the magnetic field at\n\u03c9pe t = 2000. It is evident that many current filaments exist and generate a strong magnetic field, which eventually isotropizes the incoming\nions.\n\nrippling mechanism may also operate there in our simulation. Lemb\u00e8ge et al. (2009) showed that these structures\ncan also be affected by the dimensionality of the simulations in 2D simulations; the structures when the background\nmagnetic field lies in the simulation plane may differ from those when it is perpendicular to the plane.\nElectron acceleration was not observed in our simulation, whereas Amano & Hoshino (2009) observed a kind of\nelectron acceleration in a perpendicular shock in their 2D PIC simulation, which used similar parameters to ours. The\nmain reason for this is considered to be the different directions of the upstream background field: in our simulation\nit lay in the simulation plane, whereas in the simulation by Amano & Hoshino (2009) it was out of the plane. This\nagain demonstrates that dimensionality can affect the results, even for 2D simulations.\nThe ion\u2013ion streaming instability (Stringer 1964; Ohnuma & Hatta 1965; Forslund & Shonk 1970), which has a\nwavevector that is highly oblique to the streaming direction, can be driven by the interaction between the incoming\nions and the reflected ions streaming upstream in the foot region and it can contribute to ion heating (Auer et al.\n1971; Papadopoulos et al. 1971; Wu et al. 1984; Ohira & Takahara 2008). [This instability can also be driven in\n\n\f22\n\nKATO AND TAKABE\n\nFig. 22.- ux \u2013 uy plots of the ions at \u03c9pe t = 2000 in three regions: (a) 2700 < x/\u03bbe < 2800, (b) 2800 < x/\u03bbe < 2900, and (c)\n2900 < x/\u03bbe < 3000. In (c), the ions are almost isotropized in the ux \u2013 uy plane, forming a ring-like distribution.\n\nfront of electrostatic shocks in two dimensions (Kato & Takabe 2010).] However, this instability was not observed in\nour simulation (see the right panels in Fig. 11). This is due to the high temperature of the reflected ions streaming\nupstream, TR\u2212 , in our simulation. According to Ohira & Takahara (2008), the ion\u2013ion streaming instability is efficient\nfor wavenumbers k > kDe , whereas it is damped for k > kDi due to the thermal motion of the ions. Therefore, kDe < kDi\nis a necessary condition for efficient growth of the instability. In the present case, the two ion populations have different\ntemperatures (Fig. 7) and the Debye wavenumber of the reflected ions, kD,R\u2212 , should be used to evaluate the thermal\ndamping effect. Thus, the condition for effective growth of the ion\u2013ion streaming instability is kDe < kD,R\u2212 or\nTR\u2212\nnR\u2212\n<\n.\nTe\nne\n\n(24)\n\nThe right-hand side of this equation is always smaller than unity, whereas the left-hand side is larger than unity in\nour simulation, as shown in Fig. 8. For example, at x = 2375\u03bbe , the ratios are TR\u2212 /Te = 4.2 and nR\u2212 /ne = 0.32,\nrespectively (see Table 1). Hence, the above condition is not satisfied and this would explain why the instability does\nnot grow in our simulation. To examine the effect of TR\u2212 more quantitatively, we performed linear analysis with the\nparameters obtained from the simulation at \u03c9pe t = 8000 and x = 2375\u03bbe , but changing TR\u2212 in the same way as in\nFig. 9. Figure 23 shows the linear growth rates, the wavenumbers, and the angles between the wave vector and the\nstreaming direction of the most unstable mode of the ion\u2013ion streaming instability as functions of TR\u2212 . It shows\nthat the instability depends strongly on TR\u2212 . In particular, for TR\u2212 /Te \u2265 0.35, it does not grow at all. Thus, the\ntemperature of the reflected ions (TR\u2212 ) is important for growth of the instability in the foot region as well as the\nBuneman instability.\nFinally, we mention the possibility of generating magnetized shocks in experiments. Present large-scale laser facilities\ncan generate collisionless plasma flows at speeds of \u223c 1000 km s\u22121 (Takabe et al. 2008). Thus, if magnetized collisionless plasmas flowing at this velocity can be generated in laboratories, it should be possible to perform experiments\non magnetized shocks. Table 2 shows the required background magnetic field strengths B0 for several sigma values\nand for a number density of ne0 = 1020 cm\u22123 together with the corresponding ion gyration time, Tg , and ion gyro\nradius, rg . In this table, the gyration time and the gyro radius are calculated for an ion mass of 1836me and a flow\nvelocity of 1000 km s\u22121 . Sigmas of \u03c3\u0303 = 10\u22123 or \u03c3\u0303 = 10\u22124 give achievable values for present large-scale laser facilities.\nTABLE 2\nMagnetic field strength required for experiments\n\u03c3\u0303\n10\u22122\n10\u22123\n10\u22124\n10\u22125\n\nM \u0303A\n10\n32\n100\n320\n\nB0 (G)\n4.6 \u00d7 105\n1.4 \u00d7 105\n4.6 \u00d7 104\n1.4 \u00d7 104\n\nTg (s)\n1.4 \u00d7 10\u22129\n4.7 \u00d7 10\u22129\n1.4 \u00d7 10\u22128\n4.7 \u00d7 10\u22128\n\nrg (m)\n2.3 \u00d7 10\u22124\n7.3 \u00d7 10\u22124\n2.3 \u00d7 10\u22123\n7.3 \u00d7 10\u22123\n\n5. CONCLUSION\n\nWe performed a 2D PIC simulation to investigate collisionless shocks propagating in weakly magnetized electron\u2013ion\nplasmas at nonrelativistic speeds with a sigma of \u03c3\u0303 = 10\u22124 . We showed that current filaments are generated within\nthe foot region by the ion beam\u2013Weibel instability and that they generate magnetic fields in the same manner as for\n\n\fWEAKLY MAGNETIZED COLLISIONLESS SHOCKS\n\n23\n\n-2\n\n2.5x10\n\n(a)\n\n2.0\n\n\u03c9\n\nep\n\n1.5\n\n/\nxam\n\n\u03b3\n\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n6\n\n\u03c9\n\nep\n\n(b)\n\n/c\n\n4\n\nk\n\nxam\n\n2\n0\n\n85\n\n(c)\n\n84\n]ged[\n\n83\n\n\u03b8\n\n82\n81\n80\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\nTR- / Te\n\n1\n\n10\n\nFig. 23.- (a) The linear growth rate, (b) wavenumber, and (c) angle of the most unstable mode of the ion\u2013ion streaming instability\nas functions of the temperature of the reflected ions streaming upstream, TR\u2212 , with the other parameters obtained from the simulation at\n\u03c9pe t = 8000 and x = 2375\u03bbe , as in Fig. 9. The arrow indicates the initial value of TR\u2212 in the simulation. It is clear that the instability\nsignificantly depends on TR\u2212 .\n\nWeibel-mediated shocks in unmagnetized plasmas. The magnetic field strength generated by the current filaments is\ncomparable with or even stronger than those of the compressed background magnetic field. Therefore, these filaments\nand their associated magnetic fields, which cannot be analyzed by 1D simulations, are important in the formation\nof collisionless shocks in weakly magnetized plasmas. There are current filaments in the downstream region and\nthey generate a tangled magnetic field that is typically 15 times stronger than the upstream background field. The\nthermal energies of electrons and ions in the downstream region are not in equipartition and their temperature ratio\nis given by Te /Ti \u223c 0.33. We found a fraction of the ions were slightly accelerated on reflection at the shock, whereas\nsignificant electron acceleration was not observed in our simulation. The simulation results agree very well with the\nRankine\u2013Hugoniot relations. It was also shown that electrons and ions are heated in the foot region by the Buneman\ninstability (for electrons) and the ion-acoustic instability (for both electrons and ions). However, the growth rate of\nthe Buneman instability was significantly reduced from typical growth rates of this instability because of the relatively\nhigh temperature of the reflected ions. For the same reason, ion\u2013ion streaming instability did not grow in the foot\nregion.\nOne of the authors (T.N.K.) is grateful to A. Spitkovsky for helpful discussions. We also thank Y.
