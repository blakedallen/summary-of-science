Gordon\nDepartment of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria\u2217\n\narXiv:0811.1299v1 [physics.optics] 8 Nov 2008\n\nAbstract\nRecently, radiationless electromagnetic interference (REI) has been considered to achieve focusing below the diffraction limit, with proposals for implementation in the microwave regime. In\nthis paper, subwavelength focusing using REI is extended to the visible regime. It is shown that\nthe highest-order mode of a carefully designed metal-dielectric waveguide-array can provide the\nrapidly oscillating source field for REI. Using finite-difference time-domain electromagnetic simulations, an example structure is demonstrated. This structure provides focusing to 0.21 of the\noptical wavelength at a distance of half the optical wavelength from the waveguide-array.\nPACS numbers: 78.66.Bz, 73.20.Mf, 42.25.Fx\n\n\u2217\n\nElectronic address: rgordon@uvic.ca\n\n1\n\n\fThe ability to produce a sharp optical focus away from the focusing element is limited\nby the decay of evanescent waves. The absence of these evanescent contributions leads\nto the fundamental diffraction limit. Subwavelength focusing requires the amplification of\nevanescent waves that otherwise decay away rapidly. One approach to achieving this in the\noptical regime is the \"poor-man's\" perfect-lens [1]. In this scenario, the plasmon modes of\na metal film effectively amplify the evanescent waves to produce an image at the other side\nof the metal film. For each metal, the poor-man's perfect-lens approach works around the\nspecific wavelength where the surface plasmon dispersion curve flattens out [1]. There have\nbeen several experimental demonstrations of this effect (for example, Refs. [2, 3, 4]).\nRecently, radiationless electromagnetic interference (REI) was proposed as another\nmethod to create a subwavelength focus away from the focusing element [5]. This proposal is geometric in nature and therefore not limited, at least in principle, to a specific\nwavelength. The basic idea of REI is to reconstruct the source field required at the focusing element by propagating back from the desired focus spot distribution. This backward\npropagation amplifies the evanescent (i.e., radiationless) modes associated with fine optical\nfeatures; therefore, the evanescent waves dominate focusing in the subwavelength regime.\nThe required source pattern oscillates rapidly in space [5].\nSince the initial proposal of radiationless electromagnetic interference, there have been\nseveral additional proposals for implementation and even experimental demonstrations\nwithin the microwave regime [6, 7, 8, 9]. It was recognized that metal-dielectric structures\nwould probably be required to extend these results into the optical regime [5]; however, so\nfar there have been no proposals to achieve this goal.\nIn this work, I propose using a metal-insulator waveguide array to achieve the required\nnear-field source distribution for super-focusing in the optical regime. In particular, the\nhighest-order mode of a metal-dielectric waveguide array is considered because it can provide\nthe required rapid field oscillation. The waveguide is designed to support a magnetic field\npattern that best matches the desired source field of an ideal Gaussian focus. To test\nthis proposal, comprehensive finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations are used\nto capture all the effects of diffraction, including the excitation of spurious modes. These\nsimulations show a 0.21 FWHM focus spot (only 80% larger than the design specification)\nat half a wavelength from the termination of the waveguide array structure.\nFigure 1 shows, with a blue curve, the transverse magnetic field distribution at the focus\n2\n\n\ffor a Gaussian beam. The FWHM of the magnetic field intensity is 75 nm at the wavelength\nof \u03bb = 632.8 nm. For this Gaussian focus, the plane-wave decomposition in the spatialFourier domain is also a Gaussian. Backward propagation to the source along x is achieved\nby applying the operator exp(\u2212ikx x) to each plane-wave with transverse wave-vector ky ,\nq\nwhere kx = 4\u03c0 2 /\u03bb2 \u2212 ky2 is the wavevector along the x-direction. For ky > 2\u03c0/\u03bb, this is an\nexponential increase in the plane-wave component; i.e., the evanescent waves are amplified.\nThe red curve in Fig. 1 shows the near-field distribution after propagating backward by \u03bb/2.\nThis is the rapidly oscillating near-field that is required to produce the subwavelength focus.\nThe magnetic field alternates sign between adjacent peaks.\n\n1\n\nz\n\n|H |2\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\u2212150 \u2212100\n\n\u221250\n0\n50\ny position (nm)\n\n100\n\n150\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) Magnetic field intensity at the focus has a 74.5 nm FWHM Gaussian (blue\ncurve). Magnetic field intensity at the source, \u03bb/2 from the focus (red curve). \u03bb = 632.8 nm.\n\nMetal-dielectric-metal waveguides have a unique ability to confine light to transverse\ndimensions much smaller than the optical wavelength [10]. This is achieved because of\nthe exponential decay of the electromagnetic field into the metal with negative relative\npermittivity. Here I consider an array of such metal-dielectric waveguides. The coupling in\nthe array produces supermodes (e.g., Ref. [11]).\nThe highest-order supermode provides a very rapid (subwavelength) transverse oscillation. It is this type of rapid transverse oscillation that is required to produce an extreme\nsubwavelength focus. It is not sufficient, however, to consider a uniform array, since this does\nnot produce the desired subwavelength focus. Rather, the refractive index of each dielectric\nregion should be altered slightly. (In an alternative proposal, the width of the guides can be\n3\n\n\fvaried as well to produce a higher effective index locally when the guide is made narrower \u2013\nthis case is a straightforward extension of the results presented here.)\nFigure 2 shows the highest order mode of a metal-dielectric waveguide array, designed\nto have a magnetic field distribution that is most similar to the red curve in Fig. 1. There\nare 9 dielectric layers. Each dielectric region is 10 nm wide and the refractive index values\nare 1.75, 1.73, 1.66, 1.56, 1.40, from the middle dielectric layer going outward along the\ny direction. These refractive index values may be obtained with hybrid oxide layers. The\ncenter positions of the layers are 0 nm, \u00b136 nm, \u00b172 nm, \u00b1109 nm, and \u00b1147 nm, again\ngoing outward from the middle.

The source was the mode shown in Fig. 2.\nThe metal-dielectric region is bounded by free-space for x > 0. Convergence of the FDTD\nsimulations was ensured by varying the simulation grid-size, and a 0.5 nm grid-size was used\nfor the metal region. From the FDTD simulation, it is clear that there is the scattering at\nthe interface to free-space. The scattering to very high spatial frequency components, as\nrepresented by the sharp-peak features of Fig. 2 (from, for example, the hyperbolic cosine4\n\n\fshaped points in the middle dielectric layer), decays away rapidly since they have a large\ntransverse spatial frequency. The rapid decay ensures that these spurious evanescent modes\ndo not effect the subwavelength focus at a half-wavelength distance from the interface. Due\nto the large mode-shape mismatch to the free-space propagating modes, the incident mode\nhas near-perfect reflection. This ensures the strong excitation of radiationless evanescent\nwaves without spurious propagating waves that would obstruct the subwavelength focus.\n\n1000\n\nx position (nm)\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\u2212600\n\n\u2212400\n\n\u2212200\n0\n200\ny position (nm)\n\n400\n\n600\n\nFIG. 3: (color online) Magnitude of Poynting vector, x-component, calculated by electromagnetic\nFDTD simulations.

A sharp subwavelength focus is observed,\nwith a width that is only 80% larger than the ideal case of Fig. 1. An important feature of\nthis figure is that the side peaks are suppressed significantly below the main focus.\nIn 2006, a 3 nm wide metal-dielectric-metal structure was made, and it was thinned\nto only 55 nm long [12]. The dimensions of that previous structure are smaller than the\ndimensions proposed here. Nevertheless, actual implementation will be a challenge since\nthe proposed structure has several layers with varying dielectric constant. As mentioned\npreviously, a single refractive-index dielectric can be used by varying the width of each of\n5\n\n\f1\n0.8\n\nz\n\n|H |\n\n2\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n\u2212500\n\n0\ny position (nm)\n\n500\n\nFIG. 4: (color online) Transverse magnetic field intensity at a half-wavelength away from freespace interface to the metal-dielectric waveguide array. The FWHM is 136 nm at the free-space\nwavelength of 632.8 nm.\n\nthe dielectric layer. In that alternate approach, narrowing the layer modifies the effective\nindex of the waveguide mode in that layer.\nPhysical demonstration will require the excitation of the highest-order waveguide mode.\nIn one approach to excite that mode, several transverse conduits along the y-direction may\nbe milled down, one to terminate at each channel. Such transverse conduits have been used\nto efficiently excite individual channel waveguides with propagation over several microns [13,\n14]. The spacing between the conduits can be chosen to impose the required phase-shift and\nthe conduits can be separated by large distances in the x-direction to be easily addressed\nwith conventional optics. Another approach would be to use a near-field probe at the focus\nof an array that is thinned down in the x-direction. Structures as thin as 55 nm have been\ndemonstrated [12]. This probe would rely on reciprocity to excite the highest order mode.\nFurther work is required in this area to determine the most feasible method of exciting the\nhighest-order mode.\nFinally, it is noted that the magnetic field decays substantially because of the evanescent\nnature of this technique. In particular, the magnetic field decays by two orders of magnitude\nin traveling from the interface at x = 0 to the focus at x = 632.8 nm. With high laser powers\nand high-dynamic range detectors that are commonplace today, this does not represent an\ninsurmountable challenge. This rapid decay is also an exciting prospect to remote nearfield mapping: it could provide an optical equivalent of electronic tunneling, since the field\n6\n\n\fstrength is exponentially distance dependent.\nIn conclusion, a proposal for extreme subwavelength focussing by REI was presented for\noptical wavelengths. In this proposal, the highest-order mode of a carefully designed metaldielectric waveguide structure is used to produce the subwavelength focus with a considerable\nfocal length. An example design showed a 136 nm FWHM magnetic field intensity focus over\na half-wavelength focal length, for the wavelength of 632.8 nm. This proposal presents an\nexciting prospect to future applications in extreme subwavelength lithography, data storage\nand access, and imaging.\n\n[1] J. B.
