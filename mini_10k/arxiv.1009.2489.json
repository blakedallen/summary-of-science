Two competing theories posit that Ultra Compact Dwarfs (UCDs) form either as the stripped nuclei\nof dwarf galaxies or as giant globular clusters (GGCs) associated with the largest globular cluster (GC) systems.\nBy focussing on the field and group environments where young UCDs may be most common, we have discovered\nthe first UCD that is clearly the result of recent (<4 Gyr ago) stripping of a companion galaxy. However, we have\nalso found a definitive case of a multiple-UCD system created via GC formation processes, which are likely\nassociated with major galaxy mergers. We demonstrate that it is possible to reliably distinguish the two types of\nUCD, thereby probing both the major and minor merger histories of individual galaxies.\n\n1 Introduction\nUltra Compact Dwarfs are stellar systems with radii and\nmasses intermediate between those of globular clusters and\ndwarf galaxies. UCDs have mainly been studied in galaxy\nclusters but have recently been noted in non-cluster environments as well (e.g. [1]). Intrigued by the possibility that\nUCDs are common in all environments, we undertook a\nsearch for UCDs associated with field/group galaxies. We\nvisually examined archival HST WFPC2 or ACS imaging of 76 galaxies visible from the southern hemisphere\nduring spring, discovering 11 candidate UCDs associated\nwith 9 individual galaxies. In these proceedings we focus\non three systems with spectroscopically confirmed UCDs:\nNGC3923 (2 newly confirmed + 1 probable), NGC4546\n(1 newly confirmed), and the Sombrero (1 UCD discovered\nby [1]). Using new SOAR spectroscopy, archival SAURON\nspectroscopy, and HST imaging we find evidence for two\ndistinct UCD formation channels. One is associated with\nGC formation, producing GGCs that follow a mass-size\nrelation unlike \"normal\" GCs (see Fig. 1). The second is\nassociated with the stripping of galaxy nuclei by larger\ngalaxies, yielding objects which display a similar masssize relation. This study will be described in detail in a\nforthcoming paper [2].\n\n2 Results\nWe find that using multiple lines of evidence it is possible to robustly classify UCDs as either GGCs or strippednucleus UCDs. One powerful diagnostic of UCD origin,\nfirst presented by [3], is a plot of the magnitude of the\nbrightest GC/UCD of a galaxy versus either (i) galaxy total luminosity or (ii) the total number of GCs associated\nwith the host galaxy (see Fig. 1). This plot allows one to\na\n\ne-mail: manorris@physics.unc.edu\n\nprobe whether a particular UCD is statistically consistent\nwith being a highly luminous member of the host galaxy's\nGC system. Interestingly, the UCD of NGC4546, which\nwe suspect for other reasons given below to be a stripped\nnucleus, is an extreme outlier in this plot, as are the most\nluminous UCDs of Virgo and Fornax. Other clues to the\ntrue nature of a UCD are provided by its age and [\u03b1/Fe]\n(especially when compared to those of the GCs of its host\ngalaxy), its expected dynamical friction decay timescale\nbased on projected distance from the host, and any indications of past merger events likely to have involved the\nstripping of nuclei (such as tidal tails, counterrotating gas\nin the host galaxy, etc).\nUsing these clues we find that the UCDs of NGC3923 are\nalmost certainly GGCs:\n\u2013 NGC3923 has multiple UCDs (at least 2, with 1 more\nhighly likely).\n\u2013 As in Cen A (see Fig. 1 and [4]) several NGC3923 objects previously classified as GCs smoothly transition\nbetween GC-like and UCD-like mass-size behaviour.\n\u2013 The UCDs smoothly extend the colour-magnitude relation of the blue GCs.\n\u2013 All three possible UCDs have long apparent dynamical\nfriction decay timescales (> 7 Gyr).\n\u2013 The UCDs are all consistent with the bright end of the\nGC luminosity function (GCLF, see Fig. 1).\nThe UCD of NGC4546 is almost certainly a stripped nucleus:\n\u2013 This UCD is young (\u223c3 Gyr old), whereas NGC4546\nhas a uniformly old (\u223c10 Gyr) stellar population.\n\u2013 It does not seem to be associated with an equivalently\nyoung GC population.\n\u2013 Its apparent dynamical friction decay timescale is short\n(\u223c0.5 Gyr).\n\u2013 It is not explainable as the bright extension of the GCLF\nof NGC4546 (see Fig. 1).

The UCD of\nNGC4546 provides the first clear example of a young UCD\nformed in a minor merger event by the stripping of a companion galaxy (complementing the possible young GGC\ndescribed by [6]). The multiple UCDs of NGC3923 and the\nsingle UCD of the Sombrero are likely to be GGCs, with\nproperties matching their respective GC systems. As GCs\nare generally thought to form during the major mergers responsible for spheroid formation, we therefore suggest that\nUCDs can provide a useful probe of both the major and minor merger histories of galaxies.\n\n\u22128 \u221210 \u221212 \u221214\nMV [mag]\n\nM31\nCentaurus A\n\n\u221214\n\n\u22126\n\nN1399\nM87\n\n\u22124\n\nMV,GC [mag]\n\naged to 13 Gyr it will be significantly overluminous\nrelative to the expectations of a model where it is the\nmost luminous member of NGC4546's GC system.\n\u2013 Both the UCD and the gas of NGC4546 counterrotate\nrelative to the stellar disk, suggesting a common external origin for them both.\nThe Sombrero UCD is also a probable but uncertain GGC:\n\u2013 Its stellar population properties (Age\u223c12.6 Gyr, [Fe/H]\n= -0.08, and [\u03b1/Fe] = 0.06) are consistent with those of\nthe GC system of the Sombrero [5] but may also be\nconsistent with an ancient stripping event.\n\u2013 It has a long apparent dynamical friction decay timescale\n(greater than a Hubble time).\n\u2013 It is statistically consistent with an extension of the\nGCLF (see Fig. 1), but no intermediate objects are known\nas in NGC3923.\nDespite the compelling evidence for two different UCD\nformation channels presented by NGC3923 and NGC4546,\nwe find that both UCD types have very similar colourmagnitude and mass-size diagrams. In fact, we find that\nthe loci of blue/red GCs, blue/red UCDs and dwarf/giant\ngalaxy nuclei, respectively, are indistinguishable in a colourmagnitude diagram, with dwarf nuclei and blue UCDs obeying the same mass-metallicity (\"blue tilt\") trend as massive\nblue GCs. This observation indicates that at fainter magnitudes objects traditionally classified as GCs may comprise\na composite population of \"normal\" GCs and stripped nuclei too small to qualify as UCDs.\n\n\u221214 \u221216 \u221218 \u221220 \u221222\nMV,Gal [mag]\nFig. 1.
