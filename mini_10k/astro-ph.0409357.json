(2002a, hereafter Paper IV). In this paper we\npresent the analysis of the 3-year DASI polarization data\nset, which comprises the initial data (271 days of observations) and the additional data collected during the end of\nthe 2002 season and over the entire 2003 season (191 days\nin all). The end of the 2003 season marked the conclusion\nof interferometric observations with DASI.\n\n1. introduction\n\nThe use of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) as\na precision probe of the composition and dynamics of the\nuniverse presumes the correctness of the theoretical framework by which we understand its origin and evolution.\nWith the detections of CMB polarization anisotropy by\nDASI (Kovac et al. 2002, hereafter Paper V) and WMAP\n(Kogut et al. 2003) that framework itself has passed a\ncritical test, as the presence of polarization is a generic requirement of the physics of recombination (for a recent review see Hu & Dodelson 2002). The intrinsic polarization\nof the CMB reflects the local radiation field anisotropy,\nspecifically the quadrupole moment, at the surface of last\nscattering, 14 billion years ago. Within the context of the\nstandard cosmological model, in which peaks in the CMB\nangular power spectrum are interpreted as the signature\nof acoustic oscillations seeded by primordial density fluctuations, current temperature measurements lead to specific predictions for the shape and amplitude of the polarization power spectrum and the temperature-polarization\ncross power spectrum. Furthermore, it is a firm prediction\nthat density fluctuations should create only E-mode, i.e.,\ncurl-free, polarization patterns on the sky.\nIn Paper V, we reported the high signal to noise (s/n)\ndetection of E-mode polarization in the CMB with DASI.\nKogut et al. (2003) reported the detection of the TE correlation on larger angular scales by WMAP. The DASI and\nWMAP measurements underscore the power of combining sub-orbital experiments, with their ability to achieve\nexquisite sensitivity over small areas of sky, with space experiments, whose sky coverage allows them to approach\nfundamental sample variance limits. These measurements\n\n2. observations\n\n2.1. Instrument Review\nThe use of interferometers, and of DASI in particular, to\nmeasure the angular power spectrum of CMB anisotropy\nis described extensively in Leitch et al. (2002b, hereafter\nPaper I) and in Paper IV. In short, an interferometer detects correlations between pairs of antennas, i.e., baselines,\nyielding measurements which are largely insensitive to uncorrelated noise, and which map simply into Fourier components of the sky brightness distribution, longer baselines\nmeasuring higher spatial frequencies. As they operate\nnatively in the Fourier plane, interferometers are ideally\nsuited to measurement of the power spectrum.\n1\n\n\f2\nDASI is a 13-element, co-planar interferometric array\noperating in ten 1-GHz bands spanning 26 \u2212 36 GHz. The\ntelescope sits atop an eleven meter tower located at the\nAmundsen-Scott South Pole research station. DASI was\ninitially configured for measurements of the CMB temperature anisotropy on angular scales corresponding to multipoles 140 < l < 900 (Paper I). These observations were\ncompleted during the 2000 Austral winter and the results\nreported in Halverson et al. (2002, hereafter Paper II) and\nPryke et al. (2002, hereafter Paper III). As described in\nPaper IV, several changes were made for the polarization\nobservations, including the installation of a large reflective\nradiation shield surrounding the telescope. The shield geometry ensures that all lines of sight from the telescope\nin the direction of the station buildings, the horizon and\nground, are reflected to the sky. To provide polarization\nsensitivity, the thirteen DASI receivers were each equipped\nwith cooled, broadband achromatic polarizers which can\nbe mechanically set to accept either left or right-circularly\npolarized light. Within each 1-hour interval of observation, the polarizers were stepped between right (R) and\nleft (L) positions to acquire data in all four Stokes states,\nwhich we refer to as co-polar (RR, LL) and cross-polar\n(RL, LR) data.\nA sun shield, designed to extend the polar observing season to include periods just before sunset and after sunrise,\nwas installed for the 2002 season. The shield was found to\ncontaminate the shortest baselines by secondary reflection\nat times when the moon was above the horizon, and was\nremoved for the final season. (Note however that the large\nground shield remained in place during all three seasons.)\nApart from the installation and removal of the sun shield,\nand replacement of miscellaneous hardware during routine\nmaintenance of the telescope, the instrument was identical\nthroughout the three seasons discussed here.\n2.2. Observing Strategy\nThe polarization experiment consisted of deep observations of two 3.\u25e6 4 FWHM fields, at Right Ascension 23h 30m\nand 00h 30m , and Declination \u221255\u25e6 (J2000) (see Figure 1).\nDetails of the field selection are given in Paper IV. The\nfields were observed continuously at constant elevation\n(one of the unique advantages of observing from the South\nPole), interspersed with daily observations of a calibrator source. A variety of cross-checks were built into the\nexperiment design. Observations of the two fields were\ninterleaved on 1-hour timescales to ensure that each was\nobserved over the same azimuth range, allowing effective\nremoval of any residual ground signals by differencing the\ndata. The configuration of the array elements is threefold symmetric and the entire array is fixed to a faceplate\nwhich can be rotated along the line of sight. On 24-hour\ntimescales, the observations alternated between two different orientations of the faceplate, offset by 60\u25e6 , in which the\nsame Fourier components are measured, but by different\npairs of antennas.\nThroughout the three seasons of observations, the observing strategy, as described in Paper IV, remained identical.\n\n2.3. Data Cuts\nA variety of cuts, discussed extensively in Paper IV, are\napplied to the data before input to the likelihood analyses; cut criteria and thresholds for the combined threeseason data were the same as for the data presented in\nPaper IV and Paper V. During the 2002 season, when it\nwas discovered that the short-baseline data were affected\nby reflections of the moon off the sun shield, a more stringent cut on the elevation of the moon was applied than\nduring the 2001 season. During the 2003 season, for which\nthe sun shield had been removed, cuts on the moon were\nrelaxed to the 2001 levels. Early in the 2003 season, the\npolarizer assembly for one of the DASI receivers began to\nslip, and data associated with this receiver were therefore\nexcised for the entire season, removing \u223c 15% of the 2003\ndata.\nOf the three-season data taken with the sun below the\nhorizon, approximately 53% of the co-polar data, and\n61% of the cross-polar data passed the data cuts. Cut\nfractions were dominated by cuts on the elevation of the\nmoon, and by cuts on the complex gains of multipliers in\nthe correlator (see Paper IV).\n2.4. Calibration\nThe instrumental response of each baseline of an interferometer is the complex multiplication of the individual\nantenna responses. As a result, the polarization calibration, up to an absolute phase offset, can be derived from\nobservations of an unpolarized source (see Paper IV). The\nremaining phase offset was determined by observing an\nunpolarized source through linearly polarizing wire grids\nattached to the front of each receiver. These offsets had\npreviously been measured in 2001 August and 2002 February. The wire-grid calibrations were performed again in\n2003 March and 2003 October, and results from all four\nepochs agree to within the measurement uncertainties.\nLeakage from one polarization state to the other will\nmix CMB power from T into E-modes and B-modes, and\nmust be included in the analysis. Ideally these should be\nkept as small as possible, but even significant leakages can\nbe accounted for if they are stable. The leakages can be\nseparated into a component due to the polarizers (referred\nto as on-axis leakages in Paper IV), and a beam-dependent\ncomponent which derives from the inherent properties of\nthe optics (referred to as off-axis leakages in Paper IV).\nThe latter were characterized in Paper IV, and are not expected to change. The on-axis leakages for DASI were determined from observations of a bright unpolarized source\nin 2001 August, 2002 April, 2002 July and 2003 August.\nOn-axis leakages of total intensity into the cross-polarized\ndata were found to be less than 1% at all but the highest\nfrequency bands (see Paper IV) and were consistent from\nyear to year.\n3. results\n\n3.1. Noise Model and Consistency Tests\nFor both the \u03c72 consistency tests and likelihood analyses that follow, the calibrated, field-differenced, and coadded visibility data are arranged in a data vector that is\nconsidered to be the sum of signal and noise components,\n\n\f3\n\nFig. 1.- Polarization field locations. DASI fields are marked by white circles, plotted over the Ka-band synchrotron map derived from\nthe WMAP first-year data (Bennett et al. 2003). The color scale is linear and has been clipped at one thirtieth of the maximum to allow the\nstructure at high Galactic latitudes to be seen.\n\n\u2206 = s + n. An accurate characterization of the instrument noise in the data vector is critical for estimating the\nfaint polarization signal. We calculate various statistics\nfrom the raw data to test our assumptions about the noise\nmodel: namely, that the noise is Gaussian, that the noise\nvariance is well approximated by the variance in the 8.4s samples (the fundamental data rate) over 1-hr intervals\nbefore field differencing, and that the noise is uncorrelated\nbetween data vector elements.\nDetails of the noise model tests and results for the initial\ndata set are given in Paper V. We find similar results for\nthe 3-year data. Three different types of short-timescale\n(1-hr) variance estimators are in excellent agreement with\none another, and also with the variance derived from the\nscatter of 1-hr binned visibilities over the 3-year span of\nthe data set. In Paper V, we scaled the noise by a factor\nof 1% (twice the maximum discrepancy among the various\nnoise estimators described above) to test the robustness of\nour noise estimate and found no significant change in the\nlikelihood results.\nWe construct a data covariance matrix for each day of\nobservation to test the assumption that the noise covariance matrix is diagonal, and to form a cut statistic based\non correlated atmospheric noise. Data covariance matrices for all good-weather days are averaged, to test for noise\ncorrelations persistent throughout the data set. We find\nsignificant correlations in 0.017% of the off-diagonal terms.\nThese are similar in number and magnitude to those previously described in Paper V, where we found that adding\nthe measured correlations to the noise model had a negligible effect on the final results.\nWe construct a \u03c72 statistic on sum and difference data\nvectors for various splits and subsets of the data in which\nthe same signal is expected, as a simple but powerful test\nof the noise model, data consistency, and presence of signal in the data. The statistic is given by \u03c72 = \u2206t C\u22121\nN \u2206,\nwhere \u2206 = (\u22061 \u00b1 \u22062 ) /2 is the sum or difference data\nvector, and CN = (CN 1 + CN 2 ) /4 is the corresponding\nnoise covariance matrix. We assess the significance of a \u03c72\nvalue by calculating the probability to exceed (PTE) that\nvalue in the cumulative distribution function.\nFollowing the procedure in Paper V, we split the data by\n\nepoch, azimuth range, faceplate position, and Stokes state\n(for co-polar observations) for each of the three years of\ndata individually, for each year versus the other two, and\nfor the full 3-year dataset. For each split, we also examine\nvarious subsets of the data vector, including co-polar and\ncross-polar data, data in distinct multipole ranges and the\nhigh expected s/n eigenmodes. In all, over 400 \u03c72 tests\nwere performed on various splits/subsets of the data.\nThe distribution of \u03c72 values for the differenced polarization data shows no evidence for residual signal in excess\nof the noise, giving a uniform distribution of PTE values\nwith no apparent trends or outliers. In the 2003 temperature data, several subsets which isolate high expected\ns/n eigenmodes formed from the shortest baselines compared at different faceplate rotations yield high \u03c72 values,\nthe most significant of which gives a PTE = 0.0004. Because this discrepancy appears in an isolated subset of data\nwhich contains an extremely high signal, it is suggestive\nof a small shift in instrumental response. Such a shift at\nthe level suggested by these tests would not significantly\naffect the data.\nFor the sum data vectors, a signal is detected with high\nsignificance in all of the co-polar splits and subsets, as\nwell as in many of the high s/n subsets of the cross-polar\ndata. In addition to the split data tests, we construct \u03c72\nstatistics from the highest s/n eigenmodes of the unsplit\ndata vectors, as a sensitive check for the presence of signal, as discussed in Paper V. In the cross-polar data, the\nnumber of expected s/n > 1 polarization eigenmodes has\nincreased from 34 in the initial data set to 60 for the 3year data set (taking into account off-axis leakage terms in\nthe noise covariance matrix CN , see Paper V). For these\neigenmodes, we find \u03c72 = 141.3, which corresponds to a\nPTE of 1.66 \u00d7 10\u22128 - a high-significance detection of a\npolarized signal.\nThe results of both the \u03c72 consistency tests and the\nnoise model tests demonstrate that the noise is well characterized and Gaussian, and that the data calibration is\nconsistent over the three years of observations. The sum\ndata vector \u03c72 tests on both the co-polar and cross-polar\ndata indicate the detection of signal with high-significance,\nusing a simple test that is independent of the more sophis-\n\n\f4\nticated likelihood analysis results that follow.\n3.2. Systematic uncertainties\nIn Paper V, we investigated the impact of possible\nsources of systematic uncertainties on the results of the\nlikelihood analysis. In addition to the uncertainties in the\nnoise model discussed above, we considered systematic uncertainties in the absolute cross-polar phase offsets, in the\non-axis and off-axis leakages (see \u00a72.4 for definitions), and\nin the pointing of the telescope. In each case, re-analyzing\nthe data with the systematic errors set to the limits of their\nallowed ranges led to insignificant shifts in the results.\nThe overall uncertainty of the DASI absolute calibration, derived from measurements of external thermal loads,\ntransferred to an astronomical calibrator, was estimated in\nPaper II to be 8% (1\u03c3), expressed as a fractional uncertainty on the Cl bandpower (4% in \u2206T /T ), and applies\nequally to the temperature and polarization data.\n3.3. Likelihood Results\nThe same likelihood analysis formalism described in Paper V was used to analyze the DASI 3-year polarization\ndata set. We place constraints on a given set of parameters by characterizing the shape of the likelihood function,\ni.e., the probability of our data vector \u2206, given a set of\nparameters \u03ba which describe the signal,\nL (\u03ba) = P (\u2206|\u03ba)\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u22121\nexp \u2212 \u2206t C (\u03ba) \u2206 , (1)\n2\nwhere C (\u03ba) is a model for the covariance matrix of the\ndata vector. This matrix contains the expected contributions of the instrument noise and the cosmological signal,\nas seen through the particular filter of the experiment. Details of the construction of C (\u03ba) for the DASI polarization\ndata set are given in Paper V and in Kovac (2003).\nWe report the maximum likelihood (ML) values of the\nparameters \u03ba, found using an iterated quadratic estimator technique (Bond et al. 1998). The shape of the likelihood function in the vicinity of the ML peak is characterized using direct grid evaluation for those analyses\nwith four or fewer parameters, and using a Markov chain\nalgorithm for higher dimensional analyses (Christensen\net al. 2001). Confidence intervals for individual parameters are obtained by marginalizing (integrating) the likelihood function over the remaining parameters, and reporting the equal-likelihood bounds which enclose 68% of the\nmarginal likelihood distribution (the so-called highest posterior density (HPD) interval). These are given in the text\nin the format: ML (HPD-low to HPD-high). For parameters which are intrinsically positive, we consider placing\n(physical) upper limits by marginalizing the likelihood distribution as before, but excluding the unphysical negative\nvalues. We then test if the 95% integral point has a likelihood smaller than that at zero; if it does, we report an\nupper limit rather than a confidence interval. We also include in tabulated results the uncertainty estimates and\nparameter correlation coefficients obtained by evaluating\n\u22121/2\n\n\u221d det (C (\u03ba))\n\n1\n\nthe Fisher curvature matrix F at the peak of the likelihood\nfunction.\nOur goodness-of-fit statistic, as described in Paper V,\nis the logarithmic ratio of the maximum of the likelihood\nto its value for some hypothetical model H0 described by\nparameters \u03ba0 ,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nL (\u03baML )\n\u039b(H0 ) \u2261 \u2212 log\n.\nL (\u03ba0 )\nIn the limit where the \u03baML parameter uncertainties are\nnormally distributed, the statistic reduces to \u039b = \u2206\u03c72 /2.\nWhere possible, we have tested the distribution of \u039b using\nMonte Carlo simulations and found \u2206\u03c72 /2 to be an excellent approximation. We therefore use the well-known \u03c72\ncumulative distribution function to compute the probability that, assuming a given hypothetical model H0 to be\ntrue, we would obtain a value for \u039b(H0 ) that exceeds the\nobserved value. This is quoted in the text and tabulated\nresults as a PTE and, where appropriate, as a significance\nof detection, in units of \u03c3.\nFor the 3-year data set, we perform all of the analyses reported in Paper V for the initial data set. In addition, we perform two new analyses to constrain the level\nof contamination from synchrotron or radio point source\nemission. The separate likelihood analyses constrain different aspects of the signal in the polarization data, in the\ntemperature data, or in both analyzed together. The numerical results are given in Tables 1, 2 and 3, respectively.\nClosely following the format from Paper V, we now briefly\ndiscuss each analysis in turn.\n3.3.1. E/B Analysis\nIn this analysis, two single-bandpower parameters are\nused to characterize the amplitudes of the E and B polarization spectra. DASI has an instrumental response to\nE and B that is symmetric and nearly independent. Although the B spectrum is not expected to have the same\nshape as the E spectrum, we choose the same shape for\nboth spectra to preserve this symmetry in the analysis.\nFollowing Paper V, we consider three a priori shapes to\ndetermine which is most favored by the data: the concordance1 E spectrum shape, and two alternatives: a\nflat l(l + 1)Cl \u221d constant spectrum, and a power law\nl(l + 1)Cl \u221d l2 spectrum. For each of these three cases,\nthe point at E = 0, B = 0 corresponds to the same\nzero-polarization nopol model, so that the likelihood ratios\n\u039b(nopol ) may be compared directly to assess the relative\nlikelihoods of the best-fit models. For the flat case, the\nML flat bandpower values are E = 6.2\u03bcK 2 , B = 0.0\u03bcK 2 ,\nwith \u039b(nopol ) = 10.58. For the l2 power law case, the\nML values are E = 4.2\u03bcK 2 , B = 0.0\u03bcK 2 (l(l + 1)Cl /2\u03c0\nat l = 300), with \u039b(nopol ) = 15.41. For the concordance shape, the ML values are E = 0.73, B = 0.03\nin units of the concordance E spectrum amplitude, with\n\u039b(nopol ) = 20.10. Although each of these analyses shows\nstrong evidence for an E polarization signal, the likelihood\nof the best fit model in the concordance case is a factor\nof 110 and 14,000 higher than those of the l2 power law\nand flat cases, respectively. The data clearly prefer the\n\nA \u039bCDM model with flat spatial curvature, 5% baryonic matter, 35% dark matter, 60% dark energy, and a Hubble constant of\n65 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , (\u03a9b = 0.05, \u03a9cdm = 0.35, \u03a9\u039b = 0.60, h = 0.65) and the normalization C10 = 700\u03bcK 2 . Using the WMAPext parameters changes the results of our T , E and T E amplitudes by less than 3%.\n\n\f5\nconcordance shape, which we therefore use for the E/B\nand other single bandpower analyses.\nFigure 2 illustrates the result of the E/B concordanceshape polarization analysis. The maximum likelihood\nvalue of E is 0.73 (0.53 to 0.95 at 68% confidence). For\nB, the result should clearly be regarded as an upper limit;\n95% of the B > 0 likelihood (marginalized over E) lies\nbelow 0.25.\nThe data are highly incompatible with the no polarization hypothesis. The likelihood ratio \u039b(nopol ) = 20.10\nimplies a probability that the data are consistent with the\nzero polarization hypothesis of PTE = 1.86 \u00d7 10\u22129 , assuming that the uncertainties in E and B are normally\ndistributed, as discussed above. Marginalizing over B, we\nfind \u039b(E = 0) = 19.65, corresponding to detection of Emode polarization at a PTE of 3.64 \u00d7 10\u221210 , or a significance of 6.27\u03c3.\nThe likelihood ratio for the concordance model gives\n\u039b(E = 1, B = 0) = 0.68, for which the PTE is 0.51. We\nconclude that the data are consistent with the concordance\nmodel.\n3.3.2. E5 /B5\nThis analysis parameterizes the E and B-mode spectra\nusing five, piecewise-continuous, flat bandpowers for each.\nResults of this ten-parameter analysis are shown in Figure 3. The l-ranges of the five bands, provided in Table 1,\nare unchanged from the equivalent analysis presented in\nPaper V, with corresponding window functions similar to\nthose previously reported.\nTo test for consistency with the concordance model,\nwe calculate the expectation value for that model for\neach of the five bands, yielding E=(0.8,14,13,37,16) and\nB=(0,0,0,0,0) \u03bcK2 . The ratio of the likelihood at this\npoint in the ten dimensional parameter space to the maximum likelihood gives \u039b = 3.21, which for ten degrees\nof freedom results in a PTE of 0.78, indicating that our\ndata are consistent with the expected polarization parameterized in this way. The E5 /B5 results are also\nhighly inconsistent with the zero polarization nopol hypothesis, with \u039b = 19.47, which for 10 parameters yields\nPTE = 2.6 \u00d7 10\u22125 . This likelihood ratio is close to the\nvalue \u039b(nopol ) = 20.10 obtained for the best-fit E/B\nconcordance-shaped model in the previous section, indicating that the two best-fit models, though obtained with\ndifferent numbers of parameters, offer similarly likely descriptions of the polarization signal.\n3.3.3. E/\u03b2E\nThis analysis parameterizes the E-mode polarization\nsignal as above, as well as the frequency spectral index\n\u03b2E of this signal relative to the CMB (such that \u03b2 = 0\ncorresponds to a 2.73 K Planck spectrum). As expected,\nthe results for the E-mode amplitude are very similar to\nthose for the E/B analysis described above. The result\nfor the spectral index is \u03b2E = 1.39 (\u22120.21 to 2.92). The\nindex is consistent with CMB, as \u039b(\u03b2E = 0) = 0.372 for\na PTE = 0.39. It is inconsistent with synchrotron emission, which is rejected at 2.65\u03c3 (\u039b(\u03b2 = \u22122.9) = 3.52 for a\nPTE = 0.008). Although the constraint is not strong, it\nis nevertheless interesting in the context of assessing the\nlevel of possible contamination by non-thermal emission,\nas discussed in \u00a74.\n\n3.3.4. E/sync\nHere and in the next section, we describe two new analyses using two-component models to constrain the level of\nforeground emission in the data set. In both of these analyses, the first component is the same CMB E power spectrum as in the E/B concordance-shape polarization analysis, with frequency spectral index \u03b2 = 0. For the E/sync\nanalysis, the second component is defined to be a model\nof polarized synchrotron emission with E = B, flat power\nspectra (i.e., l(l + 1)Cl \u221d constant) and a temperature\nspectral index \u03b2 = \u22122.9. The results of this analysis, given\nin Table 1 and shown in Figure 4, show that the amplitude\nof the CMB E component remains consistent with the concordance model, while the amplitude of the synchrotron\ncomponent is consistent with zero. The 95% upper limit\non the synchrotron component, E = B = 0.91\u03bcK 2, is\nwell below the level of the observed E signal, implying, as\ndiscussed in \u00a74, that there is no significant contamination\nfrom foreground synchrotron emission in the data set.\n3.3.5. E/point\nA two-component model was also used to test the extent to which the signal in our data could be due to point\nsources. For this E/point analysis, the second component\nis a model for polarized point sources, with E = B and\nl(l + 1)Cl \u221d l2 power spectra, for which we have conservatively assumed \u03b2 = \u22122. The results are given in\nTable 1 and shown in Figure 4. The amplitude of the\nCMB E component is again consistent with the concordance model, while the point source model component is\nconsistent with zero. The 95% upper limit on the point\nsource component, E = B = 0.98\u03bcK 2 at l = 300, is well\nbelow the observed signal level. We conclude that the presence of point sources consistent with the data has at most\na small effect on the polarization results (see also \u00a74).\n3.3.6. Scalar/Tensor\nTo constrain T/S directly from the polarization data, we\nperform a two-component likelihood analysis, using for one\ncomponent the concordance E shape with B = 0 for the\nscalars, and for the other component the predicted shapes\nof ET and BT for the tensors. In principle, because the\nscalar B-mode spectrum is zero, this approach avoids the\nfundamental sample variance limitations arising from using the temperature spectrum alone. However, the results\nof the E5/B5 analysis above indicate that we can place\nonly upper limits on the E and B\u2212mode polarization at\nthe angular scales most relevant (l . 200) for the tensor\nspectra. It is therefore not surprising that our limits on\nT/S derived from the polarization spectra, as reported in\nTable 1, remain quite weak.\n3.4. Temperature Data Analyses and Results for the T\nSpectrum\n3.4.1. T /\u03b2T\nIn this analysis, we use the bandpower shape of the concordance T spectrum, with the amplitude parameter expressed in units relative to that spectrum. The spectral\nindex is relative to the CMB, so that \u03b2 = 0 corresponds\n\n\f6\n\nTable 1\nResults of Likelihood Analyses from Polarization Data\nanalysis\nE/B\nE5/B5\n\nE/\u03b2E\nE/sync\nE/point\nScalar/Tensor\n\nparameter\n\nllow \u2212 lhigh\n\nML est.\n\nE\nB\nE1\nE2\nE3\nE4\nE5\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n28 \u2212 245\n246 \u2212 420\n421 \u2212 596\n597 \u2212 772\n773 \u2212 1050\n\n0.73\n0.03\n0.06\n10.5\n3.6\n22.1\n42.2\n\nB1\nB2\nB3\nB4\nB5\nE\n\u03b2E\nE\nsync\nE\npoint\nS\nT\n\n28 \u2212 245\n246 \u2212 420\n421 \u2212 596\n597 \u2212 772\n773 \u2212 1050\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n-0.37\n1.0\n1.7\n-1.6\n-26.7\n0.73\n1.39\n0.76\n-0.24\n0.76\n-0.14\n0.75\n-5.70\n\nF \u22121\n\n\u0001 1/2\nii\n\nerror\n\n68% interval\nlower\nupper\n\nU.L.(95%)\n\n\u00b10.21\n\u00b10.10\n\u00b10.8\n\u00b14.1\n\u00b14.7\n\u00b113.0\n\u00b140.0\n\n0.53\n-0.05\n-0.58\n6.3\n-2.1\n9.8\n4.5\n\n0.95\n0.12\n1.28\n16.6\n8.8\n38.8\n96.9\n\n\u2212\n0.25\n3.6\n\u2212\n15.2\n\u2212\n183.4\n\n\u00b10.55\n\u00b11.7\n\u00b13.8\n\u00b16.5\n\u00b117.9\n\u00b10.21\n\u00b11.56\n\u00b10.21\n\u00b10.28\n\u00b10.23\n\u00b10.50\n\u00b10.22\n\u00b17.5\n\n-0.81\n-0.57\n-1.6\n-6.8\n-42.9\n0.52\n-0.21\n0.56\n-0.49\n0.55\n-0.51\n0.55\n-12.0\n\n0.55\n3.1\n5.6\n5.7\n-7.0\n0.93\n2.92\n0.99\n0.21\n0.99\n0.30\n1.00\n4.5\n\n2.12\n6.45\n11.4\n16.4\n49.3\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n0.91\n\u2212\n0.98\n\u2212\n24.9\n\nparameter correlation matrices\nE1\n1\n\nE\n1\n\nE2\n\u22120.137\n1\n\nB\n\u22120.048\n1\n\nE3\n0.015\n\u22120.110\n1\n\nE\n1\n\nE4\n\u22120.002\n0.011\n\u22120.104\n1\n\n\u03b2E\n\u22120.26\n1\n\nE5\n0.000\n\u22120.001\n0.011\n\u22120.108\n1\n\nB1\n\u22120.241\n0.026\n\u22120.003\n0.000\n0.000\n1\n\nB2\n0.044\n\u22120.076\n0.008\n\u22120.001\n0.000\n\u22120.228\n1\n\nB3\n\u22120.004\n0.005\n\u22120.026\n0.002\n0.000\n0.024\n\u22120.103\n1\n\nB4\n0.001\n\u22120.001\n0.003\n\u22120.017\n0.002\n\u22120.003\n0.014\n\u22120.132\n1\n\nE\n\nsync\n\nE\n\npoint\n\nS\n\n1\n\n\u22120.26\n1\n\n1\n\n\u22120.43\n1\n\n1\n\nB5\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.002\n\u22120.016\n0.000\n\u22120.002\n0.019\n\u22120.142\n1\nT\n\u22120.27\n1\n\nunits\nfraction of concordance E\nfraction of concordance E\n\u03bcK2\n\u03bcK2\n\u03bcK2\n\u03bcK2\n\u03bcK2\n\u03bcK2\n\u03bcK2\n\u03bcK2\n\u03bcK2\n\u03bcK2\nfraction of concordance E\ntemperature spectral index\nfraction of concordance E\n\u03bcK2\nfraction of concordance E\n\u03bcK2 at l = 300\nfraction of concordance S\nT/(S=1)\n\n\f7\n\nlikelihood\n\n2\n1\n1.5\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n1\nB\n\nE\n\nlikelihood\n\n0.5\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nB\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nE\n\nFig. 2.- Results from the two-parameter shaped bandpower E/B polarization analysis. We assume the E-mode power spectrum shape\npredicted for the concordance model, and the units of amplitude are relative to that model. The same shape is assumed for the B-mode\nspectrum. (right panel) The point shows the maximum likelihood value with the cross indicating Fisher matrix errors. Likelihood contours\nare placed at levels exp(\u2212n2 /2), n = 1, 2..., relative to the maximum, i.e., for a normal distribution, the extrema of these contours along either\ndimension would give the marginalized n-sigma interval. (left panels) The corresponding single-parameter likelihood distributions marginalized over the other parameter. Note the steep fall in likelihood toward low-power values; this likelihood shape (similar to a \u03c72 distribution)\nis typical for positive-definite parameters for which a limited number of high signal/noise modes are relevant. The grey lines enclose 68% of\nthe total likelihood. The red line indicates the 95% confidence upper limit on B-mode power.\n\nto a 2.73 K Planck spectrum. The amplitude of T has a\nmaximum likelihood value of 1.23 (1.13 to 1.35), and the\nspectral index \u03b2T = 0.11 (\u22120.02 to 0.24). While the uncertainty in the temperature amplitude is dominated by\nsample variance, the uncertainty in the spectral index is\nlimited only by the sensitivity and fractional bandwidth\nof DASI. Note that these results and those for T 5 below\nhave not been corrected for contributions from residual\npoint sources (see Paper II).\n3.4.2. T 5\nIn the third panel of Figure 3, we present the results of\nan analysis using five, piecewise-continuous, flat bandpowers to characterize the temperature spectrum. Although\nthese results are entirely dominated by the sample variance in the differenced field, they are consistent with the\nfar more sensitive temperature power spectrum described\nin Paper II. We include them here and in Paper V, primarily to emphasize that DASI makes measurements simultaneously in all four Stokes parameters.\n3.5. Joint Analyses and Cross Spectra Results: TE , TB\nand EB\n3.5.1. T /E /TE\n\nIn Figure 5, we present results of a three-parameter\nsingle-bandpower analysis of the T and E spectra, and the\nTE cross correlation spectrum, using bandpower shapes\nfrom the concordance model. The T and E constraints\nare quite similar to those from the E/B, E/\u03b2E and T /\u03b2T\nanalyses described above, as expected. The additional result here is the TE correlation, which has a maximum\nlikelihood value of 1.08 (0.73 to 1.43). The data are in excellent agreement with concordance model expectations.\nFor the no TE -correlation hypothesis, we find a likelihood ratio \u039b(TE = 0) = 4.20 with a PTE of 0.0038; the no\ncorrelation hypothesis is rejected at 2.90\u03c3, a considerable\nimprovement over the TE results presented in Paper V.\nNote that under the TE = 0 hypothesis, negative and\npositive TE are equally likely, so the probability of falsely\ndetecting a positive TE correlation at this level is PTE =\n0.0019, or 3.11\u03c3.\n3.5.2. T /E /TE5\nThis is a seven-parameter analysis using single shaped\nband powers for T and E, and five piecewise-continuous,\nflat bandpowers for the TE cross correlation.

These two analyses, performed to constrain the level of\nforeground emission in the data set, both use for their first component the same CMB E power spectrum as in the E/B concordance-shape\npolarization analysis (Figure 2). For the E/sync analysis shown in the upper three panels, the second component is a model for polarized\nsynchrotron emission with E = B, flat power spectra and temperature spectral index \u03b2 = \u22122.9 (see \u00a73.3.4). For the E/point analysis shown\nin the lower panels, the second component models polarized point sources, assuming E = B spectra rising as l(l + 1)Cl \u221d l2 and \u03b2 = \u22122 (see\n\u00a73.3.5). The CMB E component is given in units of amplitude relative to the concordance model, as before. For comparison, the amplitudes\nof the second components are plotted in units relative to E = B = 8.5\u03bcK 2 at l = 300, which is the amplitude of the concordance model E\nspectrum at that angular scale. (The E/sync plot shows zero likelihood in the region where unphysical negative amplitudes for the second\ncomponent cause the covariance to be non positive-definite). It is evident that the level of foreground contamination in either of these models\nis constrained to be well below the level of the observed E signal.\n\n3.5.3.

Although there is no evidence for any B-mode signal,\nwe include the B cross-spectra for completeness. Since\n\nthe TB and EB spectra are expected from theory to be\nzero, we preserve the symmetry of the analysis between E\nand B by parameterizing them in terms of the TE and E\nshapes, respectively. The results for T , E, B and TE are\nagain similar to those obtained in the other analyses.

The increased sensitivity of the combined data set\npermits a more precise characterization of the detected\npolarization signal, and increasingly sensitive tests for the\npresence of foreground contamination.\nAs discussed in \u00a73.1, simple consistency tests with no\nassumptions about the underlying model show a high confidence detection of polarized signal. When the polarized anisotropy is modeled by a shaped spectrum over\nthe l-range spanned by DASI, the data strongly prefer\nthe concordance model shape for the E-mode spectrum\n(see \u00a73.3.1). Assuming the concordance model shape, we\n\ndetect E-mode polarization (at 6.3\u03c3 confidence), as well\nas the TE cross-correlation (2.9\u03c3), both with significantly\nincreased statistical power over the results in Paper V,\nand at levels consistent with theoretical expectations. As\nexpected for CMB anisotropies, the level of the B-mode\npolarization is consistent with zero, with an upper limit\nsignificantly below the E-mode detection.\nThe five piecewise-continuous bandpower analysis presented in \u00a73.3.2 further demonstrates that the detailed\nshape of the E-mode anisotropy is consistent with the\nconcordance predictions. The E-mode bandpowers place\na stringent upper limit in the lowest l-range band, with\nmaximum likelihood values in the remaining four bands\nthat are consistent with the damped concordance model,\nbut inconsistent with a simple l(l + 1)Cl \u221d l2 power law.\nAs shown in Figure 3 (\u00a73.5.2), the TE angular power spectrum provides a highly specific test of the spectral shape,\nas the predicted TE correlation crosses zero five times over\nthe angular range covered by the DASI measurements.\n\n\f12\nOf the known foregrounds at 30 GHz, diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission and radio point sources are of\nthe greatest concern. (As discussed in Paper V, neither\nfree-free nor dust emission, of either the thermal or spinning variety, is expected to contribute any significant polarized signal to the DASI data.) It was for this reason\nthat the two DASI fields were carefully selected from regions of exceptionally low emission in the Haslam maps\n(Haslam et al. 1981), confirmed at higher frequency by\nthe WMAP synchrotron maps to be clean regions of sky\n(Bennett et al. 2003) (see Figure 1). The two fields were\nalso selected from those with no detectable point sources\nfrom the original 32 DASI temperature anisotropy fields.\nWhile no published maps exist of the polarized synchrotron emission toward our fields, the DASI data themselves set stringent constraints on the allowed level of diffuse synchrotron. As discussed in \u00a73.3.4, a two-component\nmodel, designed specifically to probe for synchrotron emission, finds that the amplitude of a synchrotron component with \u03b2 = \u22122.9 is consistent with zero, with an upper limit well below the level of the CMB E-mode signal.\nThe E-mode spectral index constraint, improved from Paper V, indicates that the polarized signal is consistent with\nCMB; a signal with the expected synchrotron spectral index \u03b2 = \u22122.9 is rejected at the 2.7\u03c3 level. The detection\nof the TE correlation is strong evidence that the polarized signal shares a common origin with the total intensity\nsignal, a signal which has been robustly demonstrated in\nPaper II, Paper V and here to be consistent with CMB in\nboth its frequency spectral index (\u03b2 = 0.11 (\u22120.02 to 0.24)\nfrom \u00a73.4.1 above) and angular power spectrum. Moreover, the pronounced asymmetry of the E-mode and Bmode levels allowed by DASI is in sharp contrast to the\nsymmetric predictions for sources of foreground emission\n(Zaldarriaga 2001).\nSince no catalog of faint polarized sources exists over our\nobserving region, and it is not possible to identify from total intensity which point sources will have the strongest\npolarized flux, it is impracticable to project sources out\nof the polarization analyses. Nevertheless we can estimate\nthe level of residual contamination in the data. A new,\ntwo-component analysis performed on the 3-year data set\nfinds that the amplitude of a point-source component, with\na conservative spectral index \u03b2 = \u22122, is consistent with\nzero, with an upper limit well below the level of the CMB\nE-mode signal (see \u00a73.3.5).\nWe analyzed maps of the differenced fields directly for\nevidence of individual sources appearing above the noise\nfloor. The pixel value distributions are consistent with instrument noise plus a Gaussian signal, and show no sign of\nexcess tails due to discrete sources. The sensitivity of our\nmaps is such that point sources with beam-attenuated polarized flux greater than 15 mJy would have been clearly\ndetected.\nIn Paper V, we also presented a Monte Carlo analysis of\nthe expected point-source contribution, based on available\nknowledge of the source populations. The number-flux\ncounts used in the simulation (determined from the 2000\nDASI temperature data (see Paper V)) are consistent with\nthe WMAP results on dN/dS (Bennett et al. 2003), and\n\nwhile there is a dearth of data concerning the distribution of source polarization fractions at 30 GHz, a recent\n18.5 GHz study (Ricci et al. 2004) reports a distribution\nsimilar to the one assumed in our calculations. These simulations suggest a mean bias of the E parameter of 0.04\nwith a standard deviation of 0.05. We therefore conclude\nthat there is neither the expectation of, nor evidence in\nthe data for, any significant contamination by polarized\npoint sources.\n5. conclusion\n\nDASI has detected E-mode CMB polarization with high\nconfidence (6.3\u03c3 with the addition of the new data), and\nhas detected the TE correlation at the 2.9\u03c3 level. The\nshape and amplitude of the detected E-mode angular\npower spectrum are in agreement with theoretical predictions based on the CMB temperature measurements.\nThese results lend strong support to the underlying theoretical framework for the generation of CMB anisotropy\nand point toward a promising future for the field - a future which includes the detailed characterization of the Emode spectrum, the detection on small scales of B-modes\nfrom gravitational lensing, and the tantalizing prospect of\nconstraining inflationary models via the detection of largescale B-modes from primordial gravitational waves.\nThe DASI polarization results demonstrate the beauty\nof using interferometric techniques to provide wellmatched filters for E- and B-mode measurements, and\nthe inherent power of interferometers to reject uncorrelated noise and control systematics. The DASI results\nwould continue to improve with increased integration time,\nhowever the sensitivity required for the detection of the Bmode signatures demands large arrays, beyond the current\nscaling limitations of existing correlators. While there are\ncurrently no plans to upgrade DASI as an interferometer,\nadvances in technology may once again make interferometry an attractive choice for pursuing the extraordinary\ncontrol of systematics required by the next generation of\nCMB polarization experiments.\nWe thank Ben Reddall, Eric Sandberg and Allan Day\nfor their dedicated and professional support to the DASI\npolarization experiment while they wintered at the NSF\nAmundsen-Scott South Pole research station.
