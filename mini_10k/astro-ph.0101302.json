They are inferred from Faraday-rotation measurements (Vallee et al. 1986,\n1987) in polarised background radio sources, and from diffuse\nradio haloes around galaxy clusters (Kronberg 1994). Depending on several assumptions, most notably on the characteristic\nlength scale of field coherence, magnetic field strengths inferred\nfrom observations in typical galaxy cluster centres range from\n\u2248 0.1\u03bcG up to some tens of \u03bcG.\nProvided the magnetic field is tangled on sufficiently small\nscales for it to be considered randomised, it contributes a nonthermal pressure pB , which is related to the thermal pressure pth\nthrough\npB\n= 2.5%\npth\n\n|~B|\n3\u03bcG\n\n!2\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\u22121\nn\n10\u22123 cm\u22123\n\n\u0012\n\nT\n108 K\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\n.\n\n(1)\n\nConversely, magnetic fields ordered on scales comparable to the\ncluster scale can add anisotropic non-thermal pressure.\nThe structure of intracluster magnetic fields is largely unclear at present, and consequently the magnetic field strengths\nin clusters are equally uncertain. We investigate in this paper the\namount of non-thermal pressure support due to realistic magnetic fields in simulated galaxy clusters.\nOur approach is as follows (see Dolag et al. 1999). We set up\ngas-dynamical cosmological cluster simulations at high redshift\nand impose magnetic fields of variable strength and structure\nas summarised in Table 2 below. Since the origin of magnetic\nfields on cluster scales is unknown, we use two extreme types of\nseed fields, namely either completely homogeneous or chaotic\ninitial magnetic field structures. The evolution of the intracluster\nfields is then computed during cluster collapse. The initial mean\nmagnetic field strength (or energy density) is a free parameter\nin our simulations. We choose its range such that the simulated\nclusters at low redshift well reproduce the statistics of observed\nFaraday-rotation measurements taken from Kim et al. (1991). It\nturned out in earlier work (Dolag et al. 1999; hereafter DBL99)\nthat (i) the initial field structure is irrelevant because the final\nfield structure is completely determined by the dynamics of the\ncluster collapse, and (ii) initial field strengths of order 10\u22129 G at\nthe initial redshift of the simulations (see Table 1) are adequate\nto reproduce the measured Faraday-rotation statistics.\n\nM ODELS\n\nWe use a set of 90 numerically simulated galaxy clusters for investigating the effect of magnetic fields on the temperature and\npressure stratification in these clusters. Here, we summarise the\nnumerical technique only briefly because details on the methods applied, their implementation, and their performance in test\nproblems have been published elsewhere (DBL99).\n2.1. Numerical method: GrapeMSPH\nWe use the cosmological MHD code described in DBL99 to simulate the formation of magnetised galaxy clusters from an initial\ndensity perturbation field. The code combines the merely gravitational interaction of a dark-matter component with the hydrodynamics of a gaseous component. The gravitational interaction of the particles is evaluated on GRAPE boards (cf. Sugimoto et al. 1990), while the gas dynamics is computed in the\nSPH approximation (Lucy 1977; Monaghan 1992). The original\n\"GrapeSPH\" code (Steinmetz 1996) was extended by adding the\nmagneto-hydrodynamic equations to trace the evolution of the\nmagnetic fields. Because of the assumed ideal electric conductivity, the fields are frozen into the gas flow. The back-reaction\nof the magnetic field on the gas via the Lorentz force is included.\nThe numerical viscosity required to capture shocks in SPH is\nchosen such that angular-momentum transport in presence of\nshear flows is carefully controlled. The SPH kernel width is\nautomatically adapted to the local number density of SPH particles, which results in an adaptive spatial resolution of the code.\nExtensive tests of the code were performed and described in\nDBL99. The code succeeds in solving the co-planar MHD Riemann problem posed by Brio & Wu (1988). Although the simulated magnetic field is not strictly divergence-free, \u2207* ~B is always\nnegligible compared to the magnetic field divided by a typical\nlength scale of ~B (see DBL99 for details). The code also assumes\nthe intracluster medium to be an ideal gas with an adiabatic index of \u03b3 = 5/3, and neglects cooling. The surroundings of the\nclusters are important because their tidal fields affect the overall\ncluster structure and the merger history of the clusters. Therefore, the cluster simulation volumes are surrounded by a layer\nof boundary particles whose purpose it is to accurately represent\nthe tidal fields of the cluster neighbourhood. Here we specially\nfocus on the dynamical influence of the magnetic field in galaxy\nclusters, e.g. on the pressure support and the temperature in the\nclusters.\n\n\f2.2. Initial conditions\nWe set up cosmological initial conditions for two CDMdominated universes (EdS and FlatLow) as specified in Table 1.\nFor each cosmology, we calculate ten different realisations of\nthe initial density-fluctuation field at redshift zini , which result\nin clusters of different final masses and dynamical states at redshift z = 0. We simulate each of these clusters with up to five\ndifferent initial magnetic field configurations, listed in Table 2,\nyielding a total of 90 cluster models.\nTABLE 1.-Parameters of the EdS and the FlatLow models.\nmodel\nEdS\nFlatLow\n\nH0\n0.5\n0.7\n\n\u03a90\n1.0\n0.3\n\n\u039b\n0.0\n0.7\n\n\u03c38\n1.2\n1.05\n\nfbaryon\n5%\n10%\n\nzini\n15\n20\n\nIn lack of any detailed knowledge on the origin of primordial\nseed fields, we explore two extreme cases of initial field configurations. In one case (\"homogeneous\"), we assume that the\nfield is initially constant throughout the cluster volume. In the\nother case (\"chaotic\"), we let the initial field orientation vary\nrandomly from place to place, subject only to the condition that\n\u2207*~\nB = 0. The initial field strengths in both cases are determined\nby setting the mean field energy densities. Table 2 summarises\nthe initial field set-ups and the mean field strengths in the cluster\ncores. The initial field strengths are of order 10\u22129 G, the final\nfield strengths of order \u03bcG.\nTABLE 2.-Initial magnetic fields (column 2) and the resulting\nfinal magnetic field strengths in the simulated clusters (column 3\nand 4 for EdS and FlatLow models, respectively). The final values are an average of the magnetic field over the central region\n(within a radius of 350 kpc) and over all ten clusters for each\ncosmology.\ninitial field\nno\nlow (chaotic)\nlow\nmedium\nhigh\n\nBini\n0.0 G\n0.2 \u00d7 10\u22129 G\n0.2 \u00d7 10\u22129 G\n1.0 \u00d7 10\u22129 G\n5.0 \u00d7 10\u22129 G\n\nhBfinal iEdS\ncore\n-\n0.4 \u03bcG\n0.4 \u03bcG\n1.1 \u03bcG\n2.5 \u03bcG\n\nhBfinal iFlatLow\ncore\n-\n-\n0.3 \u03bcG\n0.8 \u03bcG\n2.0 \u03bcG\n\n2.3. Evolution of intra-cluster fields\nAt low redshifts, our simulated clusters reach temperatures of\nkT <\n\u223c 10 keV, in agreement with observed clusters of similar\nmass. The gas densities in their cores range within 10\u22124 \u2212\n10\u22123 cm\u22123 , as inferred from X-ray luminosities and temperatures of observed clusters.\nIn agreement with our earlier paper (DBL99), we find that\nthe structure of the intra-cluster magnetic fields at low redshifts\nis entirely independent on the structure of the initial magnetic\nfield. For homogeneous and chaotic initial field set-ups, the\nmean strength and the coherence length are the same. Initial\nfields of 10\u22129 G at zini turn into final fields of \u03bcG strength at redshift zero, and the typical coherence length of the fields is of order 50 kpc/h. In comparison to expectations based on magnetic\n\nflux conservation in spherically collapsing spheres, the amplification of the field is one order of magnitude higher because of\nshear flows in the intracluster plasma.\nDuring cluster collapse, the magnetic field is highly compressed, twisted, tangled and sheared. Any information on its\ninitial structure is lost in that process. This is confirmed by\nFig. 1, where it is shown that the magnetic pressure support does\nnot depend on the initial field structure. We can therefore restrict\nour study to the homogeneous initial field set-up, which is numerically easier to handle.\nDue to the violent motion of the intracluster plasma during\ncluster collapse, the final magnetic field strength depends on the\ndynamics of the cluster formation. Starting with identical initial\nmagnetic field set-ups, final field strengths differ by a factor of\n4 \u2212 5, depending essentially on cluster mass. The mean magnetic field strength drops by about two orders of magnitude between the cluster centre and the virial radius. A detailed study of\nthe evolution and the structure of intracluster magnetic fields in\ndifferent cosmologies will be described in a forthcoming paper.\nA direct way to compare simulated magnetic fields in galaxy\nclusters with observations is provided by Faraday-rotation measurements. We created samples of synthetic rotation measures\nby integrating the Faraday rotation along 104 light rays randomly shot through each of a sub-set of our cluster simulations.\nAs in DBL99, the cumulative rotation-measure distributions obtained in simulations with either homogeneous or chaotic initial\nfield set-up were statistically identical, confirming once again\nthat the structure of the initial field has no observable consequences for the structure of the final field processed by cluster\ncollapse.\nWe further performed two types of comparison between synthetic and observed Faraday-rotation data. In the first, we compared the radial distribution of rotation measures seen in the\nComa cluster (Kim et al. 1990) with that obtained from one of\nour simulated clusters with mass similar to Coma. In the second,\nthe sample of rotation measures compiled by Kim et al. (1991)\nfrom observations of many Abell clusters was compared to synthetic rotation measures obtained from our set of simulated clusters. In both cases, synthetic rotation-measure distributions were\nobtained along 104 light rays randomly shot through the simulations.\nBoth comparisons showed that the medium initial magnetic field strength could reproduce the observed statistics very\nwell. In both cases, the simulated and the observed rotationmeasure distributions could not significantly be distinguished in\na Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. However, the scatter in both measurements and simulations is large. This is due to the relatively\nlow number of simulated clusters per set, and to the selection\ncriteria of galaxy clusters involved in the simulations and the\nobservations. We therefore decided to allow for a range of initial magnetic field strengths which results in a range of synthetic\nFaraday-rotation distributions which are still well in agreement\nwith the observed data. Further detail can be found in DBL99\nand Dolag (2000). Comparing with more recent data by Clarke\net al. (1999), we find identical or even improved agreement. A\nstudy of clusters in different cosmologies, using newer observational data, is under way.\nChoosing a realistic model to distribute relativistic electrons\nin the simulated clusters, the simulations are also able to match\nthe properties of observed radio-haloes very well, including the\nobserved very steep relation between cluster temperature and radio luminosity (see Dolag & Ensslin 2000).\n\n\fF IG . 1.-Shown here is the ratio between the magnetic and the thermal pressure in shells around the cluster centre as a function of radius in units\nof the virial radius r200 (heavy lines). Different line types distinguish the different initial magnetic field strengths as indicated in the plot. The\ntwo dotted lines represent the low field with homogeneous and with chaotic initial field configurations. Both lead to the same amount of pressure\nsupport in the final clusters. The curves show the average across the entire simulated cluster sample. The thin lines indicate the rms scatter within\nthe sample. Near cluster centres, the ratio between magnetic and thermal pressure is consistent with the isotropic estimate of eq. (1). The left panel\nrepresents the realisations for the EdS cosmology, the right panel for the FlatLow cosmology.\n\n2.4. Quantities calculated\nThe correlation length of final magnetic field configurations near\ncluster centres is of order 50 kpc (see DBL99). Field orientations in regions large compared to the correlation length can\ntherefore be considered as randomised. For instance, there is no\npreferred direction in the final magnetic pressure distribution.\nThus, we can safely average thermodynamic quantities like the\ngas pressure and gas temperature in spherical shells, provided\nthese shells are sufficiently thick compared to the field correlation length.\nThe radial distances to the cluster centres are scaled by the\nvirial radius r200 . For simulated clusters, r200 is defined as the\nradius enclosing a mean density \u03c1\u0304(r200 ) of 200 times the critical\ndensity \u03c1cr ,\n\u03c1\u0304(r200 ) =\n\n3M(r200 )\n= 200 \u03c1cr .\n3\n4\u03c0 r200\n\n(2)\n\nThe temperature profiles give mass-weighted temperatures averaged in shells, divided by the mass-weighted temperatures in\nthe shell at the radius r200 of the corresponding non-magnetised\ncluster.\n3.\n\nR ESULTS\n\nDuring cluster formation and evolution, the simulated intracluster magnetic field strengths are amplified by compression, tangling and bending of field lines, and shear flows in the gas. The\nmagnetic field structure is also affected by merging, accretion\nof sub-clumps, and consequent relaxation processes. In combination, these processes amplify the initial magnetic fields in\nthe simulation by factors of order \u2248 1000. Final fields reach\n\nstrengths of a few \u03bcG in and near cluster centres, in good agreement with field strengths inferred from observations. The growing magnetic fields affect the balance between the gravitational\nforce and the total (magnetic plus thermal) pressure during cluster formation.\n3.1. Radial structure\nOn the whole, the fairly isotropic magnetic pressure has the tendency to counteract the gas collapse, and therefore acts in a similar manner as the thermal pressure. This implies that the gas\nstratification can achieve hydrostatic equilibrium at lower temperature, because lower thermal pressure is required in presence\nof the additional pressure support due to the magnetic field. Figure 1 shows, averaged in shells, the ratio\nD\nE\n|~B|2 /8\u03c0\np (R)\nR1 \u2264R\u2264R2\n(3)\n=\nFp (R) = B\npth (R)\nhpth iR1 \u2264R\u2264R2\nbetween the magnetic pressure pB and the thermal pressure pth\nas a function of the radius R. Due to compression and turbulence in the gas flow, the magnetic field is highest in and near\nthe centres of the simulated clusters, where the thermal pressure is also highest. As Fig. 1 shows, the relative contribution\nof magnetic fields to the pressure support appears to peak somewhere between the cluster core radii and the virial radii r200 .\nThis feature, however, is not very pronounced, so that the ratio\nbetween magnetic and thermal pressure support is almost constant across a large range of cluster-centric radii. Due to the\nsmaller final masses of the clusters in the FlatLow cosmology,\nthe magnetic pressure support is also smaller in these clusters.\nNevertheless, these less magnetized clusters are able to match\nthe observed Faraday-rotation. This is because the value of H0\n\n\fF IG . 2.-This figure shows the radial temperature profile, averaged across the simulated cluster sample. The temperature is scaled by the massweighted temperature of the non-magnetised cluster at a radius of r200 , and the radius is scaled by r200 . Different line types distinguish different\ninitial magnetic field strengths, as indicated in the plot. The temperature change with increasing magnetic field strength is clearly visible. The\ntemperature decrease near cluster centres is compatible with the isotropic estimate of eq. (1). As in Fig. 1, the left panel represents the EdS\ncosmology, the right panel the FlatLow cosmology.\n\nis chosen higher in the low-density universe, so that the projected, physical distances of the measurement locations with respect to the cluster centre shrink. Closer to the cluster centre,\nthe magnetic field is generally higher, and therefore these less\nmagnetised clusters well reproduce the measurements.\nThe overall structure of the magnetic field in the outer regions\nof the clusters differs from that near the cluster centre. Accretion and merger events arrange the magnetic fields in the outer\ncluster regions in coherent patterns on fairly large scales. Near\nthe cluster centre, the gas flow pattern is almost randomised,\nand the magnetic field is consequently tangled and bent on fairly\nsmall scales. Although the magnetic pressure can be considered\nisotropic at or near the cluster centre, it may well be anisotropic\nfurther out. Even though the fraction of the magnetic relative\nto the thermal pressure, averaged within spherical shells, is approximately constant across the cluster, the detailed effects of\nmagnetic pressure on the gas flow depend on the direction of\nthe magnetic field relative to other locally preferred directions,\nlike the orientation of filaments surrounding a cluster, the local\npath of matter infall, the orbit of a merging sub-clump and such.\nTherefore, the same overall magnetic pressure can have different effects on the local dynamics of gas flows, depending on\nwhether the magnetic field is ordered on scales comparable to\nthe cluster scale, and on the orientation of the magnetic field. In\naddition, the magnetic field alters the dynamical time scale of a\n(simulated) cluster. Therefore, when comparing simulated clusters with and without magnetic fields at equal redshifts, we must\nbe aware that we may be comparing them at slightly different\nevolutionary stages according to their intrinsic timescale.\nFigure 2 shows the temperature profile averaged across the\nset of ten simulated clusters. On the whole, the temperature increases towards the cluster centre by a factor of \u2248 2. For different cosmologies, the final clusters have a different amount\nof substructure. This leads to different shapes of the temper-\n\nature profiles for the clusters in the two different cosmologies\nused. Although the detailed temperature profile of an individual\ncluster depends on its dynamical state and formation history, the\ntendency is clearly visible that the cluster temperature decreases\nwith increasing initial magnetic field strength towards the cluster\ncentre. Deviations from this general trend are possible in individual clusters because of the reasons mentioned before. The\nmean across the entire cluster sample, however, reveals a monotonic trend increasing towards the cluster centre. This behaviour\nis expected in view of the previous discussion about the impact\nof the magnetic field in different parts of the cluster.\n3.2. Temperature-mass relation\n\nTABLE 3.-This table shows the temperature difference between the magnetised and non-magnetised clusters (columns 2\nand 4), and the rms (columns 3 and 5) of this distribution, for the\nthree different initial magnetic field strengths.

Different initial magnetic\nfield strengths are marked with different symbols. As shown before, the effect of the magnetic pressure on the temperature is on\n\n\fF IG . 3.-The large panels show the temperature-mass relation for the simulated cluster sample. Here, the temperature is the emission-weighted\ntemperature within the radius r200 . All clusters are simulated with different initial magnetic field strengths marked by different symbols, as\nindicated in the plot. The right-hand overlays show the temperature change relative to non-magnetised clusters for the different initial magnetic\nfield strengths in percent for each simulated cluster. The large scatter is obvious, but there is a general tendency towards lower temperatures in\nmagnetised clusters. To follow this relation towards lower temperatures, smaller objects (marked as gray symbols) found in the simulations are\nalso used, which lead to a total of 20 different clusters for the EdS cosmology (left panel) and 18 different clusters for the FlatLow cosmology\n(right panel). As low mass objects are represented by less particles, the resolution in these objects drops towards lower masses and the scatter in\nthese objects is expected to be larger.\n\naverage strongest near cluster centres. Therefore, the strength of\nthe effect on the temperature-mass relation depends on the chosen radius within which the mean temperature is calculated. It\nchanges also if we choose the emission-weighted instead of the\nmass-weighted temperature. For Fig. 3, we have chosen to calculate the emission-weighted temperature within the virial radius r200 in order to be comparable to the measurements. We\nalso translated the masses of the simulated galaxy clusters to\nvelocity dispersions. Figure 3 also shows the measured relationship between cluster temperatures and velocity dispersion as\ndashed-dotted line. The fairly large scatter in individual clusters\nis clearly seen. In the mean, the temperature difference between\nthe magnetised and non-magnetised clusters is \u2248 5%, and it can\ngo up to 10 \u2212 15% in individual clusters.\nAlthough the systematic effect of magnetic fields on the\nemission-weighted temperature profiles is small, the magnetic\nfields also increase the scatter in the mass-temperature relation.\nValues for the rms scatter are given in Table 3. This effect is\nmore pronounced in the EdS cosmology because of the smaller\ngas fraction in a high-density universe.\n4.\n\nD ISCUSSION\n\nWe tested the influence of the non-thermal pressure support due\nto magnetic fields in galaxy clusters. To do so, we performed\ncosmological MHD simulations of ten clusters in two different\ncosmologies, each with four different initial magnetic field configurations, thus yielding a total of 90 cluster models.\nWe chose initial magnetic field strengths such that the final intracluster fields were able to statistically reproduce the\namplitude and spatial distribution of observed Faraday-rotation\n\nmeasurements. For such fields, we found a relatively small\nnon-thermal pressure support of about 5%. The temperature\nchange in the cluster cores is therefore on average \u2248 5%, with\nthe general tendency towards decreasing temperature with increasing magnetic field strength. This tendency is most pronounced in cosmologies with a low gas fraction, i.e. a high darkmatter density. The effect of the magnetic fields can be substantially stronger in individual clusters, introducing a cosmologydependent scatter of up to (10 \u2212 15) % into the mass-temperature\nrelation.\nOur overall conclusion is that the statistical rotation-measure\ndata, taken in the most straightforward interpretation, suggests\nthat magnetic fields are generally dynamically unimportant in\ngalaxy clusters. We are aware that simulations like those presented here do not include the full range of physical processes\nrequired for a definitive calculation of intracluster fields, like\nsmall-scale turbulence and non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamics.\nA detailed study of such processes is currently out of reach for\nrealistic numerical simulations, rendering our simulations illustrative rather than definitive. We point out, however, that the\ninclusion of magnetic fields in cluster simulations does constitute an improvement over previous studies, even if it confirms\nearlier conjectures.\n5.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe wish to thank Harald Lesch for useful discussions, and the\nreferee, Jean Eilek, for her very detailed and thoughtful report.\nREFERENCES\n\n\fBrio, M., Wo, C.C., 1988, J.
