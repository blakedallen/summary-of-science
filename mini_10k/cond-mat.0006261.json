It has\nbeen suggested that this system is a Mott insulator [6] due to the large value of ratio U/W , where U is the Coulomb\ninteraction parameter, of the order of several eV, and W is the surface bandwidth, calculated to be about 0.35 eV\n[2,3]. Very recent STM data further confirm this picture [7].\nA recent LSDA+U calculation [8] predicts an antiferromagnetic insulating state with 3 \u00d7 3 magnetic periodicity and\na indirect gap of about 1.5eV, in reasonable agreement with the experimental value [4,5]. An exchange coupling J\nbetween neighboring Si adatoms of about 30K is also calculated. The LSDA+U magnetic state, with spin-collinearity\nenforced in the calculation, turns out to have a uniform magnetization mz = 1/3: one spin-down and two spinup adatom surface bands are completely filled in the 3 \u00d7 3 Brillouin zone. Crudely speaking, this corresponds to\ntwo adatom dangling-bond orbitals having spin-up electrons and one having spin-down electron in each triangular\nplaquette. When spin non-collinearity is allowed one finds, e.g., from Hartree-Fock Hubbard model calculations, [8]\nthat the state with spins lying on a plane \u2013 in a 120o three-sublattice N\u00e9el structure, typical of the triangular lattice\nHeisenberg antiferromagnet [9] \u2013 has slightly better energy than the collinear one, but the resulting energy gain is so\nsmall, about 0.5 meV/adatom, that unrealistically precise ab-initio calculations would be necessary to decide which\nof the two is the actual ground state. Moreover, the bands for the two solutions are rather similar, apart from some\nextra splittings introduced by the collinear magnetic solution [8].\nIn reality, both the LSDA+U and the Hartree-Fock Hubbard calculations, being mean-field approaches are at best\nonly cartoons for the actual Mott-Hubbard state, which is insulating not because it is magnetic, but rather due to\nstrong correlations inhibiting electron hopping. Once this is appreciated, one realizes that \u2013 even in the absence of\nany true magnetic long-range order \u2013 finite magnetic moments on the Si adatoms should be experimentally detectable\nup to high temperatures, so long as there is an insulating gap. The low-temperature low-energy collective physics\nof these unpaired adatom spins is instead governed by a much smaller energy scale, the exchange coupling J. Is it\nconceivable that a genuine low-temperature spin long-range order (LRO) would be detectable in this quasi-2D system?\nIt would seem unlikely, since: 1) The estimates for J already suggest that LRO, if present, must be there only at very\nlow temperature. Moreover, thermal fluctuations might destroy LRO altogether, if the continuous spin symmetry is\nnot broken by anisotropy effects due to spin-orbit coupling; 2) It is at present unclear which spin ordering will be\nstabilized by the spin-orbit coupling; 3) If spins lie on a plane, with zero net magnetization, they are presumably\nhard to detect with LRO sensitive techniques.\n\u221a Therefore, without ruling out totally the possibility of low-temperature\n\u221a\nLRO, we believe that the SiC(0001) 3 \u00d7 3 surface will most likely be in an overall paramagnetic Mott insulating\nstate, in spite of the existence of an on-site moment, at least down to liquid nitrogen temperature.\nIt is the aim of the present paper to discuss in some detail what kind of experimental signatures one should look\nfor in a surface Mott-Hubbard insulator, apart from a gap in the photoemission spectrum. As mentioned previously,\nmethods which require magnetic LRO are likely not viable. The situation could be much more promising at the\nintra-atomic level. We will argue below that the very fact that the system is in a Mott-Hubbard insulating state,\nindependently of the magnetic LRO issue, brings about unpaired spins in the adatom dangling bonds, which in turn\ndetermine exchange splittings in the adatom core levels which should be large and detectable. These splittings may\n\n1\n\n\fin fact have been already observed for SiC(0001) in the surface component of the Si-2p core level photoemission\nspectrum, [10] although attributed so far to some unspecified charge inequivalence of two types of Si adatoms.\nTo make things more concrete, let \u221a\nus assume\nthat, due to the Mott-Hubbard phenomenon, the 3pz -like dangling\n\u221a\nbond orbital of the Si adatom in the 3 \u00d7 3 SiC(0001) is singly occupied by an unpaired electron, say of spin up.\nIn reality, the Wannier function for the surface state is not a pure 3pz , since it extends itself down into the first SiC\nbilayer [2,8]: the weight \u03b1 of the Si 3pz orbital in the Wannier function is about 0.5, the remaining lobe having a\nnegligeable overlap with the Si-adatom core [2,8]. The 3s and 3px,y orbitals of the Si-adatom are involved in the\nbonding with first-layer C atoms, and contain spin-paired electrons. Therefore, a Si-adatom has two distinct sources\nof anisotropy: i) the first comes about because the occupation \u03b1 of the 3pz orbital is not equal to the occupation, call\nit \u03b2, of the 3px or 3py orbitals; ii) the second, and most important, source of anisotropy is due to the fact that the\nelectron in the 3pz dangling bond is spin unpaired , as opposed to the standard singlet bonding configuration in 3px,y .\nThese anisotropies break the core level symmetry between 2pz and 2px,y by an amount which we will argue to be not\nnegligeable compared to spin-orbit. We will now estimate the expected 2p core level splittings, with and without a\nspin-orbit coupling, and show that while spatial anisotropy of type i) by itself would result in a very small effect, the\nspin induced anisotropy ii) has a large influence on the spectrum.\nThe calculation we perform is very simple, and is based on the Si 2p \u2212 3p Slater exchange and Coulomb integrals,\nobtained from pure atomic Hartree-Fock calculations. Assume the Si adatom valence electrons to be distributed with\nweights \u03b1 in 3pz \u2191, and \u03b2/2 in each 3px,y \u2191 and \u2193. Let us consider first the situation in absence of spin-orbit coupling,\n\u03bbSO = 0. The Hartree-Fock energy of the 2pz \u2191 states can be written as\n\u03b2\n\u01eb2pz \u2191 = \u03b1[K2pz ,3pz \u2212 J2pz ,3pz ] + 2 [2K2pz ,3px \u2212 J2pz ,3px ] + . . . ,\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the dots stand for one-body terms and two-body contributions due to other spin-paired occupied orbitals which will exactly cancel \u0001out in all the energy differences which we will calculate.\nHere K2pz ,3pz (x) =\n\u0001\n2\n2\n2pz , 3pz(x) |e /|r1 \u2212 r2 ||2pz , 3pz(x) , and J2pz ,3pz (x) = 2pz , 3pz(x) |e /|r1 \u2212 r2 ||3pz(x) , 2pz , are the relevant 2p \u2212 3p\nCoulomb and exchange Slater integrals. The factor 2 in front of the \u03b2/2 term is due to equal contributions coming\nfrom 3py and 3px . The factor 2 in front of K2pz ,3px keeps into account the direct contribution due to both \u2191 and \u2193\n3px,y electrons. (The corresponding exchange term has no factor 2 because only 3px,y \u2191 electron contribute to the\nexchange gain of the 2pz \u2191 level.) A similar calculation for \u01eb2px \u2191 = \u01eb2py \u2191 gives\n\u01eb2px \u2191 = \u03b1[K2px ,3pz \u2212 J2px ,3pz ] +\n\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n[2K2px ,3px \u2212 J2px ,3px ] + [2K2px ,3py \u2212 J2px ,3py ] + . . . ,\n2\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhich can be reexpressed, due to rotational symmetry, in terms of the previously introduced K2pz ,3pz (x) and J2pz ,3pz (x) .\nWe now estimate the Slater integrals assuming pure atomic hydrogen-like 2p \u2212 3p orbitals (the effect of intra-atomic\nhybridization in a full atomic HF calculation would change a bit the numbers: these effects will be estimated later on).\nNumerically, the two different Coulomb integrals appearing in Eqs. 1-2 are large and comparable (K2pz ,3pz \u2248 30.5\neV, K2pz ,3px \u2248 28.2 eV), whereas the 2pz \u2212 3pz exchange integral is smaller (J2pz ,3pz \u2248 4.3 eV), but one order of\nmagnitude larger than the 2pz \u2212 3px exchange integral (J2pz ,3px \u2248 0.5 eV). The large difference between J2pz ,3pz and\nJ2pz ,3px immediately implies that the exchange splitting between 2pz \u2191 and 2pz \u2193 is rather large\n\u01eb2pz \u2193 \u2212 \u01eb2pz \u2191 \u2248 \u03b1J2pz ,3pz \u2248 2eV\nwhereas the correponding exchange splitting between 2px/y \u2191 and 2px/y \u2193 is one order of magnitude smaller:\n\u01eb2px/y \u2193 \u2212 \u01eb2px/y \u2191 \u2248 \u03b1J2pz ,3px \u2248 0.2eV\nWe can also calculate, using Eqs. 1-2, the splitting \u2206 = \u01eb2px/y \u2191 \u2212 \u01eb2pz \u2191 between the 2pz \u2191 and the 2px/y \u2191 levels,\n\u2206 = \u03b1[(J2pz ,3pz \u2212 J2pz ,3px ) \u2212 (K2pz ,3pz \u2212 K2pz ,3px )] +\n\n\u03b2\n[2(K2pz ,3pz \u2212 K2pz ,3px ) \u2212 (J2pz ,3pz \u2212 J2pz ,3px )] .\n2\n\n(3)\n\nNotice that the structure of the \u03b1 contribution in Eq. 3 differs from that of the \u03b2 term because the 3pz is assumed\nto be spin unpaired (anisotropy ii), above): If we were to assume that the occupancy \u03b1 was due \u03b1/2 3pz \u2191 and \u03b1/2\n3pz \u2193, the \u03b1 term would be given by (\u03b1/2)[(J2pz ,3pz \u2212 J2pz ,3px ) \u2212 2(K2pz ,3pz \u2212 K2pz ,3px )] and would exactly cancel\noff the \u03b2 term when \u03b1 = \u03b2 (bulk case). Plugging in the numbers for the Coulomb and exchange integrals we get\n[2(K2pz ,3pz \u2212 K2pz ,3px ) \u2212 (J2pz ,3pz \u2212 J2pz ,3px )] \u2248 [2(2.3eV ) \u2212 3.8eV ] = 0.6eV , and [(J2pz ,3pz \u2212 J2pz ,3px ) \u2212 (K2pz ,3pz \u2212\nK2pz ,3px )] \u2248 [3.8eV \u2212 2.3eV ] = 1.5eV , which provide the desidered estimate for \u2206 \u2248 \u03b1[1.5eV ] + (\u03b2/2)[0.6eV ], i.e.,\n2\n\n\f\u2206 \u2248 1eV for \u03b1 \u2248 0.5 and \u03b2 \u2248 1. The effect of intra-atomic orbital hybridization which modifies the atomic HartreeFock orbitals with respect to pure hydrogen-like 2p \u2212 3p atomic orbitals, is estimated, from a full Hartree-Fock Si+\natomic calculation, to further reduce \u2206 and the 2pz/x exchange splittings by a factor of about 2, so that we arrive at\nthe crude estimate \u2206 \u2248 0.5eV , \u01eb2pz \u2193 \u2212 \u01eb2pz \u2191 \u2248 1eV , and \u01eb2px \u2193 \u2212 \u01eb2px \u2191 \u2248 0.1eV . The overall picture for the Si-adatom\n2p spectrum in absence of spin-orbit, but with all the previously described anisotropy effects included, is summarized\nin Fig. 1(b). When we include the spin-orbit interaction \u03bbSO L * S, the final core hole levels are obtained as in Fig.\n2. For \u03bbSO = 0.4 eV (the value extracted from the bulk 2pJ=1/2 \u2212 2pJ=3/2 experimental core level splitting) we\nfind a roughly three-peaked structure, the broad central peak four times as strong as each side peak. This offers an\nalternative explanation of the experimental lineshape [10] (see Fig. 2) in terms of a single exchange-split multiplet,\nrather than two chemically inequivalent sites S1 and S2 [10] whose existence is otherwise not supported. Incidentally, a\nsimilar three-peaked structure for the Si-2p core level spectrum has been experimentally observed for a sub-monolayer\nSi segregated at the surface of iron [11].\nAdditional direct experimental evidence for the Mott-Hubbard state could be obtained by a careful study of adatom\n(3pz , 3pz ) Auger spectral intensities, which should be easily singled out owing to the large gaps. The probability of\ndouble occupancy of the adatom dangling bond orbital should be almost completely suppressed, dropping from the\nband value of 1/4, to a value of order t/U \u2013 where t is the hopping matrix element and U is the effective on-site\nCoulomb repulsion \u2013 which is one order of magnitude smaller. Even considering that only half of the orbital is adatom\n3pz , this surface should show a (3pz , 3pz ) Auger intensity which, by comparison with the remaining (3p, 3p) values,\nis anomalously small, as a proof of its Mott-Hubbard state.\nSummarizing, we have argued that the Mott-Hubbard insulating surface state in SiC(0001) should leave clear\nand detectable intra-atomic fingerprints. The Si 2p core hole will exhibit a 6-fold multiplet resulting from the joint\neffect of intra-atomic exchange, asymmetry, and spin-orbit, with a characteristic three-peaked structure. Auger\nintensities should also be affected. More experimental and theoretical effort is clearly called for to check these strong\ncorrelations and related magnetic effects, possibly the first of this magnitude to be suggested for an sp-bonded, valence\nsemiconductor surface.\nWe thank S.
