They exhibit various routes to chaos\nand their related metric universality classes [1]. In particular, one-dimensional maps are paradigmatic models\nto study the emergence of complexity in dynamical systems. In this field, much work has been done to find\nproperties of chaos that could enable a classification of\ndeterministic systems. In particular, dynamical indicators like sensitivity to initial conditions, Lyapunov exponents, Kolmogorov-Sinai (KS) entropy [2,3], topological\nentropy and others have been developed. Nevertheless,\nit is known today that there are ubiquitous natural and\nartificial dynamical systems for which these standard indicators give but a poor description of the complexity\nof their time evolution. This is typically the case in the\nfrontier between standard chaos and regular orbits. Such\ncomplex deterministic behaviour has been termed weak\nchaos, to distinguish it from strong or full chaos. The\nlatter correspond to positive metric entropy or, equivalently, positive Lyapunov exponent. The former occurs\nfor zero values of these indicators. This phenomenon has\nled to the generalization of the involved concepts [4].\n\ntial maps, here introduced in order to have one more\nparadigmatic universality class on which basic properties can be tested. In all the calculations we present\nhere, we make ensemble averages by sampling randomly\nthe entire phase space. This procedure will be shown to\nsubstantially modify the behavior at the edge of chaos,\nwhereas nothing very drastic is changed for strong chaos.\nThese results lead us to the numerical confirmation, for\nboth families of maps, of an appropriate generalization\nof the well known Pesin identity (i.e., the coincidence of\nthe positive Lyapunov exponent and KS entropy rate).\nThis generalization was conjectured in 1997 [4], recently\nproved for special trajectories (more precisely as upper\nbounds of all trajectories; see [10] for the logistic maps),\nand is here verified, for the first time, for ensemble averages.\nLet us first recall the z-logistic family of maps\nxt+1 = 1 \u2212 a|xt |z (z > 1; a \u2208 [0, 2]; |xt | \u2264 1).\n\n(1)\n\nThe critical value ac (z) (chaos threshold or edge of chaos)\nmonotonically increases from 1 to 2 when z increases from\n1 to infinity. The z = 2 map is, as well known, isomorphic to yt+1 \u221d yt (1 \u2212 yt ). The z-logistic maps constitute\nimportant universality classes of unimodal maps. The\nlarger z is, the flatter is the x = 0 maximum. To characterize a degree of flatness that z \u2192 \u221e cannot attain,\nwe introduce the following new family of maps, inspired\nin Cauchy's exponential function (infinitely differentiable\nat x = 0 and nevertheless nonanalytic):\n\nA new and fruitful approach that characterizes these\nweakly chaotic dynamical systems is related to the nonextensive generalization [5,6] of the Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG)\nstatistical mechanics. This generalization has since more\nthan one decade raised much interest in physical situations that do not satisfy the customary BG thermal equilibrium conditions, e.g., quick mixing in phase space and\nergodicity. In such cases, anomalous dynamical properties are the rule: see [7\u20139], among many others.\n\nz\n\nxt+1 = 1 \u2212 ae\u22121/|xt | (z > 0; a \u2208 [0, a\u2217 (z)]; |xt | \u2264 1) , (2)\nwhere a\u2217 (z) depends slowly from z (e.g., a\u2217 (0.5) \u2243 5.43).\nWe only address here z \u2265 zc \u2243 0.4, zc being the value\nabove which the attractors are topologically isomorphic\n(see Fig. 1) to those of the logistic map. In fact, one\nobserves a whole cascade of period doublings 2k\u22121 \u2192 2k\nat parameter values ak that accumulate at ac (z) (e.g.,\nac (0.5) = 3.32169594...) above which chaos exists.\n\nIn the present paper, we study numerically the sensitivity to initial conditions and the entropy production\nper unit time (a concept completely analogous to the\nKolmogorov-Sinai entropy rate) of the standard z-logistic\nmaps as well as of a new family of one-dimensional dissipative maps, from now on referred as to the exponen1\n\n\fand \u03bbq > 0 (q > 1 and \u03bbq < 0), the system is said to be\nweakly sensitive (insensitive) to the initial conditions.\nConsistently with these results, whenever strong chaos\nis present, the appropriate\nentropy is known to be the BG\nPW\none, SBG = \u2212 i=1 pi ln pi .

Consequently, if \u03bb1 < 0 (\u03bb1 > 0), the system is said to be\nstrongly insensitive (sensitive) to the initial conditions\n(and intermediate rounding). If, however, \u03bb1 = 0 (as it\nhappens at the edge of chaos), then \u03be(t) is expected to\nsatisfy a more general equation, namely d\u03be/dt = \u03bbq \u03be q (\u03bbq\nbeing a q-generalized Lyapunov coefficient), hence [4]\n1\n\nPW\n\ni=1\n\nq\u22121\n\npqi\n\n(S1 = SBG ).\n\n(4)\n\nThis nonextensive entropy enables in fact the generalization [5] of BG statistical mechanics itself. For each universality class of edge of chaos, one special value of the entropic index q is to be used, which we note qsen , where sen\nstands for sensitivity. Up to now, four different methods\nhave been developed which provide the special value qsen .\nThe first method is based on the sensitivity to initial conditions [4,11], the second one is related to the entropy\nproduction per unit time [14,15], the third one is based on\nthe geometrical description of the multifractal attractor\n[12], and the last one concerns relaxation properties [16].\nWe address here the first two methods. For the z-logistic\nmap, qsen (z) is known for typical values of z [11,12]: See\nfilled circles in Fig. 3 (e.g., qsen (z) = 0.2445...; also [10]\n\u03bb0.2445 = ln \u03b1/ ln 2 = 1.3236..., where \u03b1 is the Feigenbaum constant). But, for the present exponential family,\nthis is still unpublished and out of the scope of the present\nwork. Our main goal here is to study what happens when\nwe do averages (noted h...i) over the entire phase space\n(i.e., \u22121 \u2264 x \u2264 1), instead of using the special region\naround x = 0 (location of the maximum of the map).\nFor the sensitivity we proceed as follows. We consider,\nat an initial location of X, two points very close (say at a\ndistance \u2206x(0) = 10\u221212 ) and then numerically calculate\n\u03be(t) from its definition. We do this operation many times,\nstarting from values of x randomly chosen in the allowed\ninterval. Finally, we average all the values of lnq \u03be, where\nthe inverse function of the q-exponential function is defined as follows:\n\nFIG. 1. a-dependence of the dynamical attractor of the\nz = 0.5 exponential map.\n\n\u03be = [1 + (1 \u2212 q)\u03bbq t] 1\u2212q \u2261 e\u03bbq q t .\n\n1\u2212\n\nlnq x \u2261\n\nx1\u2212q \u2212 1\n(ln1 x = ln x) .\n1\u2212q\n\n(5)\n\nVarious values of q are tested until we obtain a linear\ntime dependence of hlnq \u03bei(t). That is the special value\nav\nof q we are looking for, and we denote it qsen\n, where\nav\nav stands for average; we denote \u03bbqsen\nthe linear coeffiav\ncient. See Fig. 2. For example, for the edge of chaos\nav\nof the z = 2 logistic map, we obtain qsen\n\u2243 0.36, in remarkable contrast with qsen \u2243 0.2445. We shall come\nback onto this point later. No such discrepancy is obtained for strong chaos, where we verify in all cases that\nav\nqsen\n= qsen = 1. The same method is applied to the exponential family of maps: See Fig. 2 (e.g., at the edge of\nav\nchaos ac (0.5) = 3.32169594, we obtain qsen\n(0.5) \u2243 0.35).\n\n(3)\n\nThis function, q-exponential, recovers the exponential\nfunction (a power law) for q = 1 (q =\n6 1.)

Time dependence of hlnq \u03bei and hSq i: z = 2 logistic map for strong [(a) a = 2] and weak [(c) a = 1.401155189] chaos,\nand z = 0.5 exponential map for strong [(b) a = 4] and weak [(d) a = 3.32169594] chaos. Sensitivity function hlnq \u03bei(t):\naverages over 105 (107 ) runs for (a) and (b) ((c) and (d)); we use \u2206x(0) = 10\u221212 as the initial discrepancy unless otherwise\nav\nindicated; in the insets, we show the linear tendency of the sensitivity function for qsen\nwith various values of \u2206x(0); at the edge\nof chaos ((c) and (d)) we exhibit the q = 1 curve nonlinearity.

(2), which corresponds to a\nproper characterization of extremely flat maps (z \u2192 \u221e\nof Eq. (1)); (ii) For this family of maps as well as\nfor the z-logistic ones, we performed Gibbs-ensemblelike averages on both the sensitivity and of the entropy\nproduction, and determined (exclusively from dynamav\nics) the entropic index qsen\n(z), one and the same from\nboth procedures (as it is known to occur for qsen (z)); (iii)\nav\nFor strong chaos, we verify qsen\n(z) = qsen (z) = 1 and\nav\nav\nKqsen (z) = \u03bbqsen (z) = Kqsen (z) = \u03bbqsen (z); (iv) At the\nav\nedge of chaos, we verify that qsen\n(z) decreases for increasing flatness (i.e., increasing z, in contrast with qsen (z)),\n(z) = \u03bbav\nand Kqav\nqsen (z) < Kqsen (z) = \u03bbqsen (z); the fact\nsen\nav\nthat generically qsen\n(z) 6= qsen (z) is a direct consequence\nof the fact that different initial conditions yield strongly\nfluctuating trajectories which follow along the path of\nvirtually any other trajectory but at shifted times [10]\n(no such phenomenon exists for strong chaos). All these\nresults are expected to contribute to the correct interpretation of experimental results in dynamical complex\nsystems, in particular the ubiquitous dissipative ones.\n\n0\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1/Z\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nav\nFIG. 3. z-dependence of qsen\n(empty circles and squares:\npresent work) and qsen (filled circles: from [11,12]; filled\nsquares: from [18]). Dotted lines are guides to the eye.\n\nFor the entropy production we proceed as introduced\nin [17] for conservative systems and then used in [14] for\nthe logistic map. We divide the phase space in W equal\nintervals, and put initially (randomly or not) N points\nin one of them. We then accompany the spread of points\nwithin phase space, and calculate Sq (t). This enables the\ncalculation of the entropy production per unit time\nKq \u2261 lim lim\n\nlim\n\nt\u2192\u221e W \u2192\u221e N \u2192\u221e\n\nSq (t)\nt\n\n(6)\n\nWe then repeat many times starting from randomly chosen intervals and finally average the entropy Sq itself. We\ntest various q's until we obtain a linear time dependence\nof hSq i(t); we note Kqav\nthe linear coefficient. It turns\nav\nsen\nav\nout that in all cases we obtained the same value qsen\nprovided by the method of the sensitivity (see Fig. 3). And\nav\nin all cases we obtained Kqav\nav = \u03bbq av , which remarkably\nsen\nsen\nextends the standard Pesin theorem [19].\nThis kind of averaging, on one hand mimics Gibbs' approach of thermostatistical ensembles, on the other hand\nis a natural way to minimize the considerable fluctuations which appear at the edge of chaos a = ac (z). At\nthis threshold, and in contrast with the case where strong\nchaos exists, considerably large fluctuations appear in say\nSq (t). In order to get rid of these fluctuations, we average\nhSq i(t) over a large enough number of initial windows instead of only using the \"best windows\" as done in [14,15].\nHere, we typically used W/2 windows chosen randomly.\nThe fluctuations that so remain are considerably smaller.\nIn the chaotic regime for the z = 2 logistic map we\nobtained, for a = 2, the well known result \u03bb1 = K1 =\nln 2 \u2243 0.69. In the chaotic regime (a = 4) for the z = 0.5\nexponential map, we obtained \u03bb1 \u2243 K1 \u2243 0.38.\nIn order to make the entropy result more precise (see\nthe inset (c) of Fig. 2 (bottom) for the standard logistic\nmap as illustration) we fitted the curves hSq i(t) in the\n\nWe acknowledge interesting remarks from F.
