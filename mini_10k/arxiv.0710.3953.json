The supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (SM)\nmakes improvements to phenomenological problems in\nthe physics of elementary particles: it provides a natural solution for the gauge hierarchy problem, if sparticles exist at the TeV scale. Moreover, the extrapolation of LEP data within the framework of supersymmetric extension yields a precise unification of gauge\ncouplings at a scale of \u223c 1016 GeV [6,7]. Due to these\nproperties, SUSY is one of the most attractive alternatives beyond the SM and has been the subject of many\nstudies in particle physics. However, up to now, no direct evidence for SUSY has been found. It is essential\nto examine the properties of any new states of matter\nat energy scales close to the threshold for the new phenomena, or in high energy collisions at the TeV energy\nscale.\nThe CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a p-p\ncollider, is scheduled to operate at the center-of-mass\nenergy of 14 TeV in 2008. The ATLAS experiment is\none of two general purpose experiments being nearly\nconstructed for the CERN LHC. The ATLAS detector is designed to have a good sensitivity to the full\nrange of high-pT physics in p \u2212 p collisions. Details regarding the detector and its performance are described\nin Ref. [8]. Currently we focus on preparation for the\nearly data in 2008, aiming for early SUSY discoveries.\nWe describe the strategy for early SUSY searches at\nthe ATLAS experiment using the data from the first\nyear of data taking corresponding an integrated luminosity of 1 fb\u22121 . The results in this paper are obtained\nusing the full detector simulation to understand recona\n\nEmail: shimpei.yamamoto@cern.ch\n\nstruction performances, trigger efficiencies and systematic effects of the detector.\n\n2 Inclusive searches\n\nSparticle production of gluinos (g\u0303) and squarks (q\u0303) occurs dominantly via strong interactions and its rate\nmay be expected to be considerably large at the LHC.\nGluino production leads to a large rate for events with\nmultijets via series of cascade decay and the neutral\nlightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) in the final state\nwhich remains stable and undetectable, if R-parity is\nconserved. LSP's carry off apparently large missing\ntransverse energy (ETmiss ). We note that there are no\nthird generation partons in the initial state, gluino and\nsquark production rates are fixed by QCD in terms\nof the gluino and squark masses (mg\u0303 and mq\u0303 ). Thus,\ninclusive SUSY searches with the early data rely on\nexcesses of events in the channel of \"multijets + large\nETmiss \" [9] which is a model-independent feature.\nIn our searches, the events are classified based on\nthe topology, the number of identified isolated leptons, and we try to cover a broad range of experimental signatures. The experimental signatures, corresponding SUSY scenarios and their background processes are summarized in Table 1. They cover realistic supersymmetric models of minimal supergravity\n(mSUGRA) [10,11,12,13], anomaly-mediated SUSY breaking (AMSB) [14,15] and gauge-mediated SUSY breaking (GMSB) [16,17].\n\n\fColliders - SUSY Phenomenology\n\nContributed Talk\n\nTable 1.

The effective mass is formulated as Meff =\nPi\u22644 i\nmiss\n, where piT is the transverse momeni=0 pT + ET\ntum of i-th leading jet. In addition, for the singlelepton signature, the events are selected by requiring\none isolated lepton with pT larger than 20 GeV and the\ntransverse mass (MT ) should be larger than 100 GeV.\nThe selection cuts described here are based on the definition given in Ref. [8], but will be optimized.\nFinally, we look for SUSY events with large Meff\nat which the signal exceeds the SM backgrounds. The\nvalue of Meff also provides a first estimate of the sparticle masses. Fig. 1 shows the Meff distributions for\nno and single-lepton signatures. For the SUSY signal,\nwe set a bench mark point in the bulk region, where\nm0 = 100 GeV, m1/2 = 300 GeV, A0 = 300 GeV,\ntan \u03b2 = 6 and \u03bc > 0, referred to SU3. If SUSY exists\nwe expect there is an excess over the SM background\nexpectation in the distribution for each event topology\nwith an integrated luminosity up to 1fb1 .\n\n2.2 Discovery reach\nFigure 2 shows 5 \u2212 \u03c3 discovery reach in the mg\u0303 -mq\u0303\nspace for each event topology in the mSUGRA model.\nWe see that even for sparticle mass as heavy as \u223c\n1 TeV, discoveries are expected for an integrated luminosity of 1fb\u22121 .

The mismeasurements or inefficiencies for jets and muons also\ncontribute to the ETmiss ; these make up the fake ETmiss .\nA precise understanding of these contributions and\ntheir reduction are crucial, especially in the tails of\nthe distribution.\n\n\fShimpei Yamamoto\n\nStrategy for early SUSY searches at ATLAS\n\nm( g~ ) (GeV)\n2000\n1800\n\nATLAS Preliminary\n0 lepton mode\n1 lepton mode\n2 lepton mode\n\n1600\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n\neffects of the detector because they affect the normalization and shapes of predicted backgrounds.

Generator-level uncertainties of 100% are\nshown by the hatched regions. The results are obtained on\nthe assumption of tan\u03b2 = 10, A0 = 0 and \u03bc > 0.\n\nFor the calibration and commissioning of ETmiss , we\nuse the transverse mass distributions of W \u2192 l\u03bd and\nthe invariant mass of Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4\u0304 where \u03c4 's decay into a\nlepton and hadrons. For the Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4\u0304 , as an example,\nthe invariant mass is reconstructed using the collinear\napproximation; it is sensitive to the ETmiss scale and\nresolution. Fig. 3 shows the Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4\u0304 invariant mass\npeak as a function of the ETmiss scale. A variation of\n10% in the ETmiss scale results in a 3% shift on the Z\nmass scale. The Z mass can be reconstructed with an\nerror of 1% using an accumulated data of 100 pb\u22121 .\nConsidering the uncertainty of 1% on the absolute energy scale of the calorimeters, we can evaluate the\nETmiss scale with an accuracy of \u223c 4% accordingly.\nThe fake ETmiss originating from the instrumental\neffects of the detector have also been studied. All the\nresults for the commissioning are given in Ref. [18].\n\nZ Mass (GeV)\n\nATLAS Preliminary\n\n105\n100\n95\n90\n85\n80\n75\n70\n0.6\n\n4.2 QCD multijet background\nThe QCD multijet production could be one of the most\ndominant SM background sources due to its large cross\nsection. In QCD events, neutrinos via leptonic decays\nand the mismeasurements of jets contribute to the tails\nof ETmiss distribution. For the QCD background contamination, the estimation is derived from the multijet\ndata with a function representing the fluctuations of\nmeasured jet energies. The fluctuation of jet energy is\nevaluated using events of\n\u2013 ETmiss > 60 GeV,\n\u2013 \u2206\u03c6(ETmiss , jet) < 0.1,\n\nZ Mass vs ETmiss scale\n\n110\n\nThe process of Z \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304 in association with multijets\nwill give rise to final states with large ETmiss and could\nbe a dominant background for the no-lepton signature.\nFor this background contamination, the expectation is\nderived from the MC distribution of Z \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304 with the\nnormalization determined by the Z \u2192 ll\u0304 data, where\nl is e or \u03bc. We can better measure the Z \u2192 ll\u0304 yield\nthanks to small backgrounds in the final state. This\nnormalization factor can be also applied to the W \u2192 l\u03bd\nbackground. Differences due to different masses and\nproduction mechanisms can be taken from theory.\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\nETmiss scale\n\nFig. 3.

We\nsuppose that ETmiss is originated from the fluctuating\njet close to the ETmiss direction, and the pT of initial jet\nmiss\nis estimated to be the vectorial sum of pjet\n.\nT and ET\nThen we can obtain the fluctuating function of jet enjet\nmiss\nmiss 2\nergies (R \u2261 1 \u2212 pjet\n)/|pjet\n| ).\nT * (pT + ET\nT + ET\nmiss\nThe jets in QCD multijet events with small ET are\nsmeared according to the jet fluctuating function, which\nresult in fluctuations of ETmiss . Fig. 4 shows the jet fluctuating function and the ETmiss distribution with the\nsuperimposed QCD background estimation. We can\nobtain a fair description of the QCD background with\nthis method, especially in the tails of the distribution.\n4.3 MT discrimination method\nAnother advanced method to estimate the SM backgrounds, especially for single-lepton signature, is to\nuse MT which shows a discriminating power between\nSUSY and SM backgrounds but are less dependent on\nETmiss . At first, we select events of MT < 100 GeV to\n\n\fColliders - SUSY Phenomenology\n\nContributed Talk\n\nclosestJet_measRes\n\nEntries\nMean\nRMS\n\n60\n\nATLAS Preliminary\n\n812\n0.7287\n0.1465\n\nATLAS Preliminary\n\n104\n\nSignal (SU3)\nAll BG's + Signal\nQCD\nZ\nEstimated QCD\n\n50\n3\n\n40\n\n10\n\n30\n\n102\n\n20\n\n10\n\n10\n\nprogress in the in-situ calibration of ETmiss and the\ndata-driven technique for the SM background estimations.

Then, the overall normalization of SM backgrounds is determined by\ncomparing the number of events with MT < 100 GeV\nand that with MT \u2265 100 GeV in the low ETmiss region\nbelow 200 GeV.\nThe MT distribution and the resultant Meff are\nshown in Fig. 5. The estimated number of SM backgrounds with large Meff (> 800 GeV) and the MC\nprediction are 22.0 \u00b1 0.9 and 24.8 \u00b1 1.6, respectively.\nThey show a good agreement, however, there could\nbe a contamination of signal events in the background\ncontrol sample, which results in the overestimation of\nbackgrounds by a factor of \u223c 2. We will make further\ninvestigations to improve this method and to reduce\nthe signal contamination in the normalization region.\nResults will be reported in Ref. [18].\n\nReferences\n\nATLAS Preliminary\n\nSUSY (SU3)\nAll backgrounds\nttbar (\u2212>lnln)\nttbar (\u2212>lnqq)\nW\n\n102\n\n102\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n\n9.\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.\n\nATLAS Preliminary\nMC prediction\ndata\u2212driven estimation\n\n10\n\n14.\n\n10\n\n15.\n\n1\n\n1\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n10\u221210\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\nM T(GeV)\n\n100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900\nETmiss (GeV)\n\nFig. 5.

Using the inclusive signature of multijets plus large ETmiss , we can make an\nearly discovery of SUSY. Our searches are less modeldependent but sensitive to models with squark and\ngluino masses up to 1 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 1fb\u22121 . However, the precise understanding\nof the SM backgrounds is crucial for the early discovery. To settle this issue, we have been making much\n\n16.\n17.\n18.\n\nJ. Wess and B. Zumino, Nucl Phys.
