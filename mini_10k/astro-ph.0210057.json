Improved observations of globular clusters are uncovering a\nlarge number of radio pulsars and of X-ray sources. The latter include\nbinaries in which a neutron star or a white dwarf accretes matter from\na companion, recycled pulsars, and magnetically active binaries. Most of\nthese sources originate from close encounters between stars in the cluster\ncore; magnetically active binaries and some cataclysmic variables have\nevolved from primordial binaries. The formation rate through close encounters scales differently with the central density and core radius of the\ncluster than the probability for a single binary to be perturbed by an\nencounter. This is exploited in some preliminary observational tests of\nthe close encounter hypothesis.\nAccreting black holes have been found in globular clusters with other\ngalaxies; the absence of such holes in the Milky Way clusters is compatible with the small number expected.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nInterest in binaries in globular clusters revived when the first X-ray maps of\n>\nthe whole sky showed an overabundance in globular clusters of bright (Lx \u223c\n36\n10 erg/s) sources: whereas globular clusters contain \u223c0.1% of the stars of\nour galaxy, they contain about 10% of the bright X-ray sources. It was soon\nsuggested that close stellar encounters in globular cluster cores were responsible\n< 1035 erg/s) sources\n(Clark 1975). With more sensitive instruments faint (Lx \u223c\nwere detected in globular clusters: 8 in 8 clusters with the Einstein satellite in\nthe 1980s (Hertz & Grindlay 1983), and 57 in 23 clusters with ROSAT in the\n1990s (Verbunt 2001). Of the latter 57, 17 are more than two core radii from\nthe cluster core. In the new millenium, Chandra detected about 100 faint Xray sources in 47 Tuc alone, and 25-40 sources in each of NGC6752, NGC6397,\nand NGC6440 (Grindlay et al. 2001a,b, Pooley et al. 2002a,b; Fig. 1). First\nXMM results are now being published (Webb et al. 2002; Webb, Gendre in\nthese proceedings).\nRadio pulsars have also been detected in large numbers: 20 in 47 Tuc\nalone, 8 in M15, 5 in NGC6752, and some 20 in a dozen other clusters (Freire\net al. 2001, D'Amico et al. 2002, and lists in e.g. Phinney 1992, Lyne 1994, and\non the Web: Freire 2002). Almost all of these are recycled radio pulsars, i.e.\nhave obtained their rapid rotation (and probably also their low magnetic field)\nthrough accretion of matter and angular momentum from a companion star.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nVerbunt\n\n10 arcsec\n\n23\n\n17\n12\n10\n18\n21\n\n6\n11\n\n2\n\n9\n22\n\n1\n13\n\n19\n\n4\n\n3\n\n5\n\n16\n\n14 15\n24\n\n7\n8\n\n20\nN\n\nE\n\nFigure 1.\nX-ray sources\nin NGC6440. Sources 1\ncertainly and 2, 3 and 5\nprobably are neutron stars\naccreting from a companion star at a low rate; most\nof the other sources are\nprobably white dwarfs accreting from a companion,\ni.e. cataclysmic variables.\nNote that the source distribution extends beyond the\ncore radius (indicated with\na dashed circle), but remains well within the halfmass radius (solid-line circle). From Pooley et al.\n(2002b).\n\nAt the moment 13 bright X-ray sources are known in a total of 12 globular\nclusters. The only binaries producing such luminosities are low-mass X-ray\nbinaries, in which a neutron star or black hole accretes mass from a companion.\nBecause of the occurrence of X-ray bursts, 12 of the 13 bright sources in clusters\nare known to be neutron stars; the 13th one is \u2013 on the basis of its X-ray spectrum\n\u2013 probably a neutron star as well (in 't Zand et al. 1999, White & Angelini 2001).\nThus there is no evidence for accreting black holes in any globular cluster with\n< Lx (erg/s) \u223c\n< 1035 are most likely\nour galaxy. The dim sources with 1032.5 \u223c\n< 1032.5 ) are\nneutron stars accreting at a low rate; most of the dimmer sources (\u223c\nprobably cataclysmic variables, but some of them are recycled radio pulsars, or\nmagnetically active close binaries ('RS CVns') \u2013 see e.g. Fig.8 in Verbunt et al.\n(1997); and the articles by Cool and Edmonds in these proceedings.\nIn this review I discuss the formation and evolution of these X-ray sources\nand recycled radio pulsars. Formation through evolution from a primordial binary is compared with formation via close stellar encounters in Section 2. The\nevolution of binaries with a compact star (neutron star or white dwarf) is described in Section 3. Various tests of our theoretical ideas are made by comparison with observation in Section 4. A brief discussion in Section 5 of X-ray\nsources in globular clusters of other galaxies, precedes the Summary.\n2.\n\nFormation: evolution versus encounters\n\nAll binaries that we observe in the disk of the galaxy have evolved from primordial binaries. Binaries which are very common in the disk, apparently are\ncommonly formed via ordinary binary evolution. If we find such binaries in a\nglobular cluster, it is likely that they have evolved from primordial binaries as\nwell. Examples of such binaries are RS CVn's and contact binaries. On the\nother hand, binaries with neutron stars (or black holes) are extremely rare in\n\n\fNeutron stars in globular clusters\n\n3\n\nthe disk; such a binary in a globular cluster is formed almost certainly from a\nclose encounter of a neutron star with a single star or with a binary. Cataclysmic\nvariables are in between these extremes: in globular clusters with dense cores,\nsuch as 47 Tuc, most may have formed via stellar encounters; but in more open\nclusters, as \u03c9 Cen, they may have evolved from primordial binaries (Verbunt &\nMeylan 1988).\nWe consider tidal capture first. The encounter rate is proportional to the\nencounter cross section A, to the relative velocity v, and to the numbers nc and n\nper unit volume, of compact stars and ordinary stars respectively. To obtain the\nencounter rate \u0393 for the cluster as a whole, one integrates over the cluster volume;\nbecause of the high densities in the core this roughly corresponds to multiplying\nthe central rate with the core volume. Due to gravitational focussing, the cross\nsection A of close encounters is proportional to the radius of the star R and\ninversely proportional to the square of the velocities v (see also Davies, these\nproceedings). Thus (Hut & Verbunt 1983):\n\u0393\u221d\n\nZ\n\nnc nAvdV \u221d\n\nnc nR\n\u03c12 r 3\ndV \u221d o c R\nv\nv\n\nZ\n\n(1)\n\nWhere \u03c1o is the central mass density and rc the core radius. An analogous\nreasoning gives the exchange encounter rate\n\u0393e \u221d\n\nZ\n\nnc nb Ab vdV \u221d\n\nZ\n\n\u03c12 r 3\nnc nb a\ndV \u221d o c a\nv\nv\n\n(2)\n\nwhere nb is the number of binaries per unit volume, and a the semi-major axis\nof the binary. The ratio of tidal capture to exchange encounters is roughly\nR n\n\u0393\n\u223c\n\u0393e\na nb\n\n(3)\n\nThe susceptibility of large binaries to close encounters with other cluster\nstars implies that many such binaries are dissolved by passing stars. As a result,\nthe formation of cataclysmic variables from evolution of primordial binaries,\nwhich passes through a stage in which the binary is very wide, is suppressed in\nglobular clusters (Davies 1997).\nThe importance of tidal capture is under debate, because it leads to an\ninitially highly eccentric orbit: the circularization of this orbit is accompanied\nby dissipation of an amount of energy \u2206E which is comparable to the binding\nenergy Eb of the ordinary star:\n\u2206E\n\u2243\nEb\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212GM m\n/\n2ac\n\u0013\n\n3GM 2\n5R\n\n!\n\n\u2243\n\n5mR\n6 M ac\n\n(4)\n\nwhere M and R are the mass and radius of the tidally distorted star, m the\nmass of the other star and ac the radius of the circularized orbit. If the energy is\ndissipated more rapidly than it can be radiated or convected away, the ordinary\nstar is destroyed, and no binary remains (Ray et al. 1987).\nTidal capture, if successful, tends to lead to orbits with a \u2243 3R, i.e. to orbits\nwith short periods, less than 1 day, say. In contrast, exchange encounters favour\n\n\f4\n\nVerbunt\n\nwide orbits, and in addition will cause a recoil velocity of the binary which may\ntake it out of the cluster core \u2013 perhaps even out of the cluster! Tidal capture\ncan also occur during an encounter of a single star with a binary, when the\nthree-body intraction brings two stars close to one another.\nA much debated point of uncertainty is the number of neutron stars that\nremain in a cluster after their formation: young pulsars obtain a kick velocity\nat birth, as witnessed by the observed velocities of radio pulsars. It has been\nargued that these velocities are higher than the escape velocities of globular\nclusters, implying that no neutron stars would be retained. In my opinion, the\nvelocities of pulsars have been rather overestimated, due to underestimates of\nthe errors in proper motions and distances (see Hartman 1997). A recent list of\n16 accurate velocities obtained with VLBI (Brisken et al. 2002) indicates that\nas much as a third of neutron stars is born with velocities less than \u223c 50 km/s.\nThus as many as 30% of the neutron stars born in globular clusters are retained.\nLoss of neutron stars from globular clusters is counteracted by mass segregation,\nwhich concentrates the (relatively heavy) neutron stars in the cores, where the\nencounter rates are highest (Verbunt & Meylan 1988).\nThe presence of pulsars in globular clusters is interesting, as they constrain\nthe amount of non-luminous matter (to which they themselves do not contribute\nsignificantly, as the mass in white dwarfs is always much higher). A pulsar which\nhas a radial velocity vr with respect to us, will be observed at a period shifted by\n\u2206P = (vr /c)P . If the pulsar is accelerated, a period derivative \u2206\u1e56 = (ar /c)P\nis measured on top of the intrinsic period derivative. Since the latter is always\npositive, measurement of a negative period derivative indicates that acceleration\ndominates, and thus provides an estimate of the mass density. Phinney (1992)\nhas shown that the pulsars in M15 put a tight constraint on the mass of any\nblack hole in the cluster core \u2013 the most likely mass of the cluster core can\nin fact be explained by the sum of visible stars and white dwarfs, if the mass\ndistribution initially followed the Salpeter function, i.e. no black hole is required.\n3.\n\nBinary evolution\n\nThe evolution of a binary with a neutron star (or black hole, or white dwarf) is\na complex topic, which is described only briefly here. For more detail, see e.g.\nVerbunt (1993). The mass transfer in a close binary in which a companion to\na neutron star fills its Roche lobe, can be driven by loss of angular momentum\nfrom the orbit. If a compact star of mass m receives matter from a Rochefilling star with mass M , the mass transfer rate is roughly given by \u2212\u1e40/M \u2243\n \u0307 b , where Jb is the binary angular momentum. For a main sequence\n\u1e41/m \u223c J/J\nstar donor, the orbital period Pb is roughly given by Pb (hr) \u2243 8M (M\u2299 ), and\ngravitational radiation leads to a mass transfer rate of order 10\u221210 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\nWhen accreted onto a neutron star this leads to an X-ray luminosity \u223c 1036\nerg s\u22121 . The observation of higher X-ray luminosities in such binaries have lead\nto the suggestion of additional mechanisms of loss of angular momentum, such\nas 'magnetic braking', in which a stellar wind carries away angular momentum\nefficiently because it is tied to the stellar surface out to large radii by magnetic\nfield lines. The efficiency of magnetic braking is unknown; recent studies of\nstellar rotation in young star clusters suggests that its importance may have\n\n\fNeutron stars in globular clusters\n\n5\n\nbeen over-estimated (e.g. Tinker et al. 2002). The mass transfer rate may also\nbe affected if the donor is irradiated by X-rays from the accreting star. If\nthis irradiation causes the star to expand, it may enhance the mass transfer\nrate; if it causes an enhanced stellar wind and mass loss from the binary, it may\nreduce the mass transfer rate. Whether irradition is important is not known; the\nabsence of strong heating effects in most well-observed low-mass X-ray binaries\nsuggests that the accretion disk shield the secondary from X-rays emitted near\nthe accreting star.\nIf the mass transfer stops, the neutron star may spin rapidly enough to\nswitch on as a radio pulsar. The standard description of evolution through loss\nof angular momentum does not foresee such an end however, but rather predicts\nan everlasting, albeit ever lower, mass transfer. The observation of close binaries\nwith a pulsar shows that the mass transfer does, in fact, stop. Perhaps if the\nmass transfer is variable, it may reach a state sufficiently low that the pulsar\nswitches on, after which the pulsar wind itself can prevent further mass transfer.\nOnce more, the details of such a process are not understood.\nThe star that donates matter to a neutron star can also be a white dwarf;\nin that case the orbital period is roughly Pb (s) \u2243 50/M (M\u2299 ). In such a binary,\nstable mass tranfer can only occur if the white dwarf has a mass less than\n\u223c 0.66M\u2299 ; a more massive white dwarf will expand so rapidly with mass loss\nthat it is disrupted within one binary revolution (Verbunt & Rappaport 1988).\nIf the initial binary is too wide, loss of angular momentum is not important,\nand mass transfer will only start when the donor expands as it ascends the\n(sub)giant branch. In that case \u2212\u1e40 /M \u2243 \u1e41/m \u223c \u1e58/R, where R is the stellar\nradius. According to stellar evolution, \u1e58 increases with R, and thus the mass\ntransfer rate is expected to be higher in wide binaries. Conservation of angular\nmomentum widens the orbit as mass is transferred from the (sub)giant to the\nneutron star; typically, the orbital period has increased by a factor \u223c 7 by the\ntime that the whole envelope has been transferred. From that point on, the\nbinary will consist of a neutron star and a white dwarf. The mass transfer\nputs an early end to the growth of the giant core, and the emerging white\ndwarf is undermassive; typically Mwd \u223c 0.25M\u2299 . Tidal interaction during the\nmass transfer leads to an orbit which is almost but not quite circular. The\nobserved white dwarf masses and the relation between orbital period and (small)\neccentricity provide strong support for this evolution scenario for recycled pulsars\nwith white dwarf companions (Phinney 1992).\nIt is observed that rather more millisecond pulsars are found in globular\nclusters than can be formed from the currently observed X-ray binaries. A\nsolution could be that most recycled pulsars were spun up in binaries with\ndonors of intermediate mass, 1-3 M\u2299 (Davies & Hansen 1998).\n\n4.\n\nFormation through close encounters: testing the theory\n\nWith a growing number of binaries with neutron stars observed in globular\nclusters, we can start comparing their observed properties with the theory of\nformation. To do so, we refer to Eqs. 1 and 2, and note that the virial theorem relates the velocity dispersion to the central density and core radius of the\n\n\f6\n\nVerbunt\n\nFigure 2.\nCentral density as a function of core radius for globular\nclusters in our Galaxy. Data from Harris (1996, revision of June 22\n1999). Dotted lines indicate loci of constant formation rate \u0393 in the\ncluster, according to Eq. 6; approximate numerical factors are indicated\non the right for R = R\u2299 (applicable to tidal capture) and for a =\n100R\u2299 , nb \u2243 n (exchange encounters) where x indicates one encounter\nper 10x yr.

The numbers\nindicated use the King model for the numerical factor in Eq. 5. The formation\nrate of binaries with neutron stars can be high because the central density is\nhigh, or because the cluster has a large core.\nThe situation is different for the probability that a binary, once formed, will\nundergo a subsequent encounter which may change or destroy it. The rate at\nwhich a binary undergoes close encounters is given by\n\u03b3 = nAv \u221d\n\n\u03c1o\n\u03c1o 0.5\na\u221d\na\nv\nrc\n\n(7)\n\n\fNeutron stars in globular clusters\n\n7\n\nFigure 3.\nVarious \u2013 preliminary \u2013 tests on neutron stars in binaries\nin globular clusters. a) Number of binaries with neutron stars, b) Slope\nof the luminosity function of the X-ray sources, c) Orbital periods of\npulsar binaries, d) Pulsar pulse periods. For details see text.\n\nLines of constant \u03b3 are also shown in Figure 2. We see that in the clusters with\nthe highest central density, both close binaries (formed from tidal capture) and\nwider binaries (formed from an exchange encounter) are affected by subsequent\nencounters.\nThe exact encounter rates in a cluster depend on the mass function in the\ncore, hence on the mass segregation, on the fraction of stars in binaries, and\non the period distribution of the binaries. For encounters involving neutron\nstars, the rates depend on the retention fraction of neutron stars. Also, it is not\nclear how one should treat a collapsed cluster. All these factors are different in\ndifferent clusters. In the absence of detailed information on most clusters, we\ncan only perform preliminary tests, in which we ignore these factors.\nOne such test is that the probability that a cluster contains a bright X-ray\nsource scales with \u0393, i.e. with the collision number \u03a3 \u2261 \u03c12c rc3 /v. The bright X-ray\nsources pass this test (Verbunt & Hut 1987). Johnston et al. (1992) claim to find\nthat the probability that a cluster contains a recycled pulsar is less dependent\non \u03c1c , viz. \u221d \u03c11.5\nc ; however, this lower dependence may be an artefact of their\nassumption that v is the same in all clusters (compare eqs.1 and 6).\n\n\f8\n\nVerbunt\n\nSome further tests are illustrated in Figure 3. Numbers used in these tests\nfor the X-ray sources / radio pulsars were taken from: \u03c9 Cen Rutledge et al. 2002\n/ \u2013; 47 Tuc Grindlay et al. 2001a / Freire et al. 2001; NGC6440 Pooley et al.\n2002b / Lyne et al. 1996; M15 White & Angelini 2001 / Phinney 1992; NGC6752\nPooley et al. 2001a / D'Amico et al. 2002; NGC6397 Grindlay et al. 2002b / \u2013.\nNumbers for other pulsars from: M53 Kulkarni et al. 1991; M5 Anderson et al.\n1997; M4 Thorsett et al. 1999; NGC6342 Lyne et al. 1993; NGC6624 Biggs et\nal. 1994.\na) \u03c9 Cen contains one neutron star X-ray binary and no (known) pulsar,\nwhereas 47 Tuc, NGC6440 and M 15 contain respectively 2, 4 and 2 neutron star\nX-ray binaries and 20, 1 and 8 (known) pulsars. \u03c9 Cen indeed has a lower value\nof \u0393 than the other three clusters.\nb) The slope p of the X-ray luminosity function dN (Lx ) \u221d Lx \u2212p d ln Lx\n(including neutron star binaries, cataclysmic variables, pulsars, and magnetically\nactive binaries) is steep in 47 Tuc (p = 0.8), intermediate in NGC6752 and\nNGC6440 (p = 0.5), and shallow in NGC6397 (p = 0.3). This may be related to\nthe high value of \u03b3 in NGC6397, which prevents a binary from evolving without\nbeing interfered with; thus ordinary binaries in this cluster have largely been\ndestroyed (Pooley et al. 2002b).\nc) The clusters M4 and M53 contain pulsars in binaries with long orbital\nperiods of 191 and 256 days; these clusters indeed have a low value of \u03b3, i.e.\nwide binaries are not affected by encounters. 47 Tuc, with a higher value for \u03b3,\ndoes not contain pulsars in binaries with periods longer than 2.3 d. (The binary\nin M4 in fact has a companion third star at about 6000 R\u2299 ; the outer binary\nhas only an expected life time of 108 yr.)\nd) It has been an outstanding puzzle that all pulsars in 47 Tuc and NGC6752\nhave very short pulse periods (< 7.6 ms and < 9.0 ms), whereas those in M15\nhave pulse periods ranging up to 111 ms. Long periods also are found in NGC6342,\nNGC6440 and NGC6624 (1.0 s, 289 ms and 379 ms). There is no obvious correlation of the pulse period range with \u0393 or \u03b3.\nThe encounter hypothesis for the formation of binaries with a neutron star\nsurvives the preliminary tests.\n5.\n\nGlobular clusters in other galaxies\n\nWith the Einstein and Rosat satellites, X-ray sources in globular clusters of\nM31 have been discovered. On the whole it appears that the properties of these\nsources are not significantly different from those in our galaxy (Supper et al.\n1997). Thanks to Chandra it has become possible to observe X-ray sources in\nother galaxies, with fairly accurate positions. As a result, it has been found\nthat globular clusters in other galaxies contain X-ray sources with luminosities\nabove 1039 erg/s (Angelini et al. 2001, Sarazin et al. 2001, Kundu et al. 2002)\nAt such luminosities, the X-ray sources are probably black holes accreting from\na binary companion; this is confirmed by the soft X-ray spectrum when it can\nbe measured. Apparently the clusters in those galaxies do contain black holes in\nbinaries. This is not necessarily a significant difference with the clusters in our\ngalaxy: if 20 % of the bright X-ray sources in globular clusters would contain\nblack holes, the expectation value for such binaries in our globular cluster system\n\n\fNeutron stars in globular clusters\n\n9\n\nwould be 2 or 3. For this expectation value the probability of finding zero is\nappreciable.\nA first contribution by XMM is the detection of a faint X-ray source in\nMayall II, the largest cluster of M31 (Verbunt, Meylan & Mendez, in preparation).\n6.\n\nSummary\n\nThe overabundance in globular clusters of binaries with neutron stars is due to\nformation of such binaries in close encounters. When the neutron star accretes\nmatter from its companion, it is an X-ray source. Chandra observations show\nthat there are 5 to 10 times as many neutron stars accreting at low rates than\nat high rates. Whether this is related to their formation mechanism is not clear,\nsince a similar overabundance is found in the galactic disk where binaries with\nneutron stars evolve from primordial binaries (Cornelisse et al. 2002). When the\nneutron star stops accreting, it can become a radio pulsar. Most cataclysmic\nvariables in globular clusters are also formed in close encounters.\nTidal capture leads to a short orbital period, and has no associated recoil\nvelocity; exchange encounters favour wide binaries and do involve recoil. Most\nneutron star binaries are found in or close to the cores of globular clusters. Most\nbinaries with a pulsar have relatively short orbital periods, and mass functions\nthat indicate a mass of \u2243 0.25M\u2299 for their white dwarf companion. In my\nview, this indicates that these binaries were formed via tidal capture. Some\nbinaries have rather longer orbital periods, and some are far from the cluster\ncore. These binaries were probably formed via exchange encounters. From the\nX-ray luminosity function it appears that magnetically active binaries \u2013 that\nmake up the low\u2013luminosity end of the distribution \u2013 are destroyed in dense\nclusters.\nObservations of globular clusters in other galaxies show that black holes\nare present in them. It would be interesting to investigate whether any of the\nlow\u2013luminosity X-ray binaries in the globular clusters of our galaxy contains a\nblack hole. The small number of X-ray sources in clusters of our Galaxy hampers\ncomparison of their properties with those in globular clusters systems of other\ngalaxies.\nReferences\nAnderson, S., Wolszczan, A., Kulkarni, S., & Prince, T. 1997, ApJ, 482, 870\nAngelini, L., Loewenstein, M., & Mushotzky, R. 2001, ApJ, 557, L35\nBiggs, J., Bailes, M., Lyne, A., et al. 1994, MNRAS, 267, 125\nBrisken, W., Benson, J., Goss, W., & Thorsett, S. 2002, ApJ, 571, 906\nClark, G. 1975, ApJ, 199, L143\nCornelisse, R., Verbunt, F., in 't Zand, J., et al. 2002, A&A, 392, 931\nD'Amico, N., Possenti, A., Fici, L., et al. 2002, ApJ, 570, L89\nDavies, M. 1997, MNRAS, 288, 117\nDavies, M. & Hansen, B. 1998, MNRAS, 301, 15\n\n\f10\n\nVerbunt\n\nFreire, P. 2002 http://www.naic.edu/\u223cpfreire/GCpsr.html\nFreire, P., Camilo, F., Lorimer, D., et al. 2001, MNRAS, 326, 901\nGrindlay, J., Heinke, C., Edmonds, P., , & Murray, S. 2001a, Science, 292, 2290\nGrindlay, J., Heinke, C., Edmonds, P., et al. 2001b, ApJ, 563, L53\nHarris, W. 1996, AJ, 112, 1487\nHartman, J. 1997, A&A, 322, 127\nHertz, P. & Grindlay, J. 1983, ApJ, 275, 105\nHut, P. & Verbunt, F. 1983, Nat, 301, 587\nin 't Zand, J., Verbunt, F., Strohmayer, T., & et al. 1999, A&A, 345, 100\nJohnston, H., Kulkarni, S., & Phinney, E. 1992, in X-ray binaries and the formation of binary and millisecond pulsars, ed.
