In fact this model is usually considered\nthe prototypical example of discontinuous mean-field spin glasses. The latter, in turn, have\nbeen argued to be crucial for understanding the structural glass transition [5]. In this paper we\nshow that the p-spin spherical model is indeed quite an exceptional case among discontinuous\nmean-field models. While our results do not invalidate the insight gained so far, they add some\nnew important feature to the general picture.\nThe out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the p-spin spherical models is closely related to the\nstructure of metastable states [6]. Below the dynamical temperature Td , the Gibbs measure\ndecomposes among an exponential number of metastable states, whose free-energy densities\nlie between two values fs and fd . The relevant quantity in this regime is the complexity (or\nconfigurational entropy) \u03a3T (f ). This is defined in terms of the number NT (f ) of metastable\nstates having free energy density f ,\nNT (f ) \u223c exp{N \u03a3T (f )} ,\n\n(1.1)\n\nN being the number of degrees of freedom of the system. \u03a3T (f ) is strictly positive between\nfs and fd , with an absolute maximum at fd . The free-energy density f\u2217 (T ) of the pure states\nwhich dominate the Gibbs measure, results from the balance between energetic and entropic\nconsiderations. While the former would privilege the states at fs , the latter favor the states\nat fd .\nOn the other hand, in a typical out-of-equilibrium set up, the system is rapidly cooled\nbelow Td from its high-temperature phase [3]. In the thermodynamic limit, the system never\nequilibrates and its behavior is dominated by the most numerous metastable states, i.e. the\nones at fd . This means that, for any single-time observable O(t), the following identity holds\nlim lim hO(t)i = lim hOifd ,\n\nt\u2192\u221e N \u2192\u221e\n\nN \u2192\u221e\n\n2\n\n(1.2)\n\n\fwhere the average on the left-hand side is taken with respect to thermal histories, while\non the right-hand side it is taken with respect to a constrained Gibbs measure. Outside\nthe thermodynamic limit, the system eventually equilibrates on an exponential time scale\nterg (N ) = exp{O(N )}.\nThe complexity \u03a3T (f ) can be calculated within a 1RSB scheme [7]. This calculation is\nknown to be correct for the p-spin spherical model [1]. This does not rule out the possibility\nof further replica-symmetry breakings for more general cases: one would then expect a FRSB\ncalculation to be necessary. The consequences of FRSB on the above picture have not been\ninvestigated so far. However, it is usually thought that FRSB would play a minor role. The\nintuition, as far as we can understand it, goes as follows. As shown in 1984 by Elisabeth\nGardner [8] in the case of the p-spin Ising model, discontinuous spin glasses may have a\nFRSB phase which overcomes the 1RSB phase at very low temperature. The common wisdom\nassociates low temperature to low energy: if any FRSB effect is present, it affects, at most,\nthe lowest part of the complexity spectrum. As a consequence, out-of-equilibrium dynamics\nis unaffected by FRSB. Here we show that this intuition is incorrect and that FRSB plays an\nimportant role also for discontinuous mean-field glasses.\nThe correct scenario is sketched in Fig. 1. The 1RSB solution is stable with respect to\nFRSB up to some value fG of the free-energy density. At higher free energies, the 1RSB\nsolution becomes unstable and a FRSB calculation is required. Quite generally fG < fd\nstrictly. We know just two exceptions to this rule (both are somehow degenerate cases): the\nspherical model and the REM [9]. On the contrary both the situations fG < fs and fG > fs\nare possible. A thermodynamic FRSB phase transition occurs when fG crosses f\u2217 (T ). Above\nfG , the FRSB calculation will give a new complexity curve, and, in particular a new threshold\nfree energy fd\u2032 . Of course, out-of-equilibrium dynamics will be dominated (in the sense of Eq.\n(1.2)) by the states at fd\u2032 . Finally, also the nature of aging dynamics will change. We expect\nrelaxation to be characterized by an infinite number of time sectors [10, 11] (instead of just\ntwo), although two of them will be most relevant (namely the first and the last one).\nIn the next Sections we shall illustrate the general scenario with two examples which are,\nat the same time, simple and representative. In Sec. 2 we reconsider the fully-connected\nIsing p-spin model. The simplicity of this example allows us to study the problem at finite\ntemperatures. In Sec. 3 we turn to finite connectivity models at zero temperature. In this case\nwe can compare our results with numerical simulations.\n\n2\n\nInfinite connectivity\n\nThe fully-connected p-spin model is defined by the Hamiltonian\nX\nH(\u03c3) = \u2212\nJi1 i2 ...ip \u03c3i1 \u03c3i2 . . . \u03c3ip ,\n\n(2.1)\n\n(i1 ...ip )\n\nwhere the N variables \u03c3i = \u00b11 are Ising spins and the Ji1 i2 ...ip are quenched random interactions extracted from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance p!/(2N p\u22121 ). For\nillustration we shall often consider the p = 3 case, although our results are qualitatively valid\nfor any finite p > 2.\nUsing the standard replica formalism with a 1RSB Ansatz, one obtains the action [8]\nZ\n\u0003 1\n1\n\u03b2\u0002\np\np\u22121\nlog Dz coshm (\u03b2\u03bb z) , (2.2)\n\u2212 log 2 \u2212\n\u03c6(\u03b2, m) = \u2212 1 + (p \u2212 1)(1 \u2212 m)q \u2212 p q\n4\n\u03b2\n\u03b2m\n\n3\n\n\fTs Td\n\n1\n\nms(T)\n\n1RSB\nstable\nregion\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\nq>0\n\nm\n0.4\n\nmd(T)\nm G(T)\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\nunstable\nregion\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nTG\n\n0.3\n\nT\n\n0.4\n\nq=0\n\nq>0\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nFigure 2: 3-spin fully-connected Ising model: the Parisi parameter m for thermodynamic states\n(dotted-dashed curve) and for threshold states (dashed curve) as a function of the temperature. In\nthe shaded region, 1RSB solutions are unstable with respect to further replica symmetry breakings.\n\nwhere Dz \u2261 e\u2212z\n\n2 /2\n\nq\n\u221a\ndz/ 2\u03c0, \u03bb \u2261 p2 q p\u22121 and q is determined by the saddle point equation\nq=\n\nR\n\nDz coshm (\u03b2\u03bbz) tanh2 (\u03b2\u03bbz)\nR\nDz coshm (\u03b2\u03bbz)\n\n.\n\n(2.3)\n\nFrom the action (2.2) we have the usual parametric representation [7] of the complexity \u03a3T (f )\nat temperature T = 1/\u03b2:\n\u03a3 = \u03b2m2 \u2202m \u03c6(\u03b2, m) ,\n\nf = \u2202m [m \u03c6(\u03b2, m)] .\n\n(2.4)\n\nThe outcome of this formulae agrees with the general picture sketched in Fig. 1, that is \u03a3T (f )\nis positive for f \u2208 [fs , fd ], which corresponds to m \u2208 [ms , md ]. Both the extrema of this range\ndepend on the temperature. The internal energy of metastable states can be calculated using\nthe identity\ni\n1 X\n\u03b2h\n(2.5)\ne(\u03b2, m) = \u2212\nJi1 i2 ...ip h\u03c3i1 \u03c3i2 . . . \u03c3ip i = \u2212 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 m) q p ,\nN\n2\n(i1 ,...,ip )\n\nwhere q satisfies Eq. (2.3).\nThe thermodynamics of the model at temperature T (within the 1RSB approximation)\nis obtained maximizing \u03c6(T, m) with respect to m \u2208 [0, 1]. The resulting ms (T ) is shown in\nFig. 2 (dotted-dashed curve): it becomes smaller than 1 at the critical temperature Ts and it\nvanishes for T \u2192 0 as ms \u223c \u03bcs T . Threshold states, those maximizing the complexity \u03a3, are\nobtained fixing m = md (T ), which is shown in Fig. 2 with a dashed curve: md (T ) becomes\nsmaller than 1 at the dynamical critical point Td and vanishes as md \u223c \u03bcd T .\nThe stability of the 1RSB solution with respect to a second step (and eventually infinite\nsteps) of replica symmetry breaking can be evaluated following Ref. [8]. For any given T and\n\n4\n\n\fm the 1RSB solution is stable provided\nR\nDz coshm\u22124 (\u03b2\u03bbz)\n2\nR\n>\np(p \u2212 1)\u03b2 2 q p\u22122\nDz coshm (\u03b2\u03bbz)\n\n.\n\n(2.6)\n\nIn Fig. 2 the region where replica symmetry should be broken more than once has been shaded.\nWe call mG (T ) its boundary. In Ref. [8] Elizabeth Gardner calculated the critical point TG\nwhere thermodynamic states are no longer 1RSB (this point was called T2 in Ref. [8]). Still\nmore interesting is the fact that threshold states are always in the unstable region.\nThe physical scenario already described in Sec. 1 (see Fig. 1) is confirmed for any temperature below Td . In general we find that fG is strictly less than fd , while both the inequalities\nfG < fs and fG > fs are possible, depending on the temperature. For f < fG the 1RSB\nsolution is correct and the Parisi order parameter q(x) has a single step at x = m (see lower\ninset in Fig. 1 and please remind that in the absence of an external field q0 = 0). For f > fG ,\nthe FRSB calculation will give an order parameter q(x) with a continuous non-trivial part\nabove the step (see upper inset in Fig. 1), a new complexity curve and, in particular, a new\nthreshold free energy fd\u2032 . The geometrical structure of metastable states above fG is therefore\nthe following. There is an exponential number of families of states, each one having a FRSB\nstructure inside. The typical overlap between two families is 0, while the minimum overlap\nbetween states of the same family is given by the step size in the function q(x).\nLet us suggest a natural generalization of the above method, for computing \u03a3(f ) above\nfG . Given the free-energy functional [12] \u03a6FRSB [T, q(x)], one can parameterize q(x) by the\njump location m and by the continuous function r(x) for x \u2208 [m, 1]. Then one can define\n\u03c6(T, m) = maxr(x) \u03a6FRSB [T, q(x)], by maximizing the free-energy functional for fixed T and\nm1 . Finally the complexity is obtained by taking the Legendre transform of \u03c6(T, m) as in Eq.\n(2.4). The complete calculation can be done using e.g. the numerical method of Ref. [13]. Here\nwe show the result of a 2RSB approximated calculation at zero temperature.\nIn the T \u2192 0 limit, the 1RSB free energy is simply given by\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u221a \u0013\u0015\np\n\u03bc 1\n1RSB\n\u03bc\n,\n(2.7)\n\u03c6T =0 (\u03bc) = \u2212 \u2212 ln 1 + erf\n4 \u03bc\n2\nRx\n2 \u221a\nwhere \u03bc = lim\u03b2\u2192\u221e \u03b2m and erf(x) \u2261 2 0 dt e\u2212t / \u03c0. The resulting complexity \u03a3(e) is shown\nin Fig. 3 (dashed curve).\nThe 2RSB free energy \u03c62RSB\nT =0 (\u03bc1 , \u03bc2 ) depends on two numbers which parameterize, as in the\n1RSB case, the zero temperature limit of the Parisi breaking parameters. The three overlaps\nbehaves as follows: q0 = 0, q1 = q (with 0 < q < 1 strictly) and q2 \u2243 1 \u2212 \u03c9 T . The saddle\npoint equation for q reads\nR\n\u03bd\u22122\n2 (z, q, \u03bc )\n(z, q, \u03bc2 ) I\u2212\nDz I+\n2\nR\n,\n(2.8)\nq =\n\u03bd\nDz I+ (z, q, \u03bc2 )\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u03b7\u03bc2 \u03bbz\n\u03b7\u03bc2 \u03bbz\ne\u03bc2 \u03bbz\ne\u2212\u03bc2 \u03bbz\n+\n\u2212\nI\u00b1 (z, q, \u03bc2 ) =\n1 + erf\n\u00b1\n1 + erf\n, (2.9)\n2\n2\n\u03b7\n2\n2\n\u03b7\n\n1\n\nThis means that one has to maximize \u03a6FRSB [T, q(x)] among all the order parameters q(x) such that q(x) = 0 for\nx < m. Let us call mFRSB\nthe position of the discontinuity in the statical FRSB solution qs (x). If m < mFRSB\n, there\ns\ns\nis one trivial solution to this maximization problem: q(x) = qs (x). We expect a non-trivial secondary maximum to\nexist. On such a maximum the discontinuity in q(x) is located at m. This expectation is indeed confirmed by our\n2RSB calculation.\n\n5\n\n\f0.07\n0.06\n0.05\n\n1RSB\n\n\u03a3\n\n0.04\n0.03\n0.02\n\n2RSB\n\n0.01\n0\n-0.82\n\n-0.81\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.79 -0.78\nf=e\n\n-0.77\n\n-0.76\n\n-0.75\n\nFigure 3: T = 0 complexity as a function of the (free) energy density for the 3-spin fully-connected\nIsing model, obtained with 1RSB and 2RSB approximations.\n\nq\np\nwhere \u03bd \u2261 \u03bc1 /\u03bc2 , \u03bb \u2261 p2 q p\u22121 and \u03b7 \u2261 p(1 \u2212 q p\u22121 ).

In the interesting region of parameters the shape of \u03c6(\u03bc1 , \u03bc2 ) is that of 2 com-penetrating paraboloids (see Fig. 4): On the\nleft paraboloid we have that q = 0 and we recover the 1RSB solution with \u03bc = \u03bc2 , while on\nthe right paraboloid q takes non-trivial values and we find there the absolute maximum of\n\u03c6(\u03bc1 , \u03bc2 ), corresponding to the ground state energy.

The incorrectness of the 1RSB Ansatz for threshold states is clear from the\nunphysical behavior of ed (T ), which is not a monotonously increasing function of T : an annealing experiment with a very slow cooling, following 1RSB threshold states, would produce\nan increase of energy when temperature is decreased!\nThe energy obtained with an extremely slow cooling, i.e. that of threshold states, must\nlie below ed (T ) and above both es (T ) and eG (T ), and it must be a monotonously increasing\nfunction of T . We can estimate ed (T = 0), from the zero-temperature 2RSB calculation above.\nThe result is marked by an arrow in Fig. 5. As already noticed, this value is much lower than\nwhat predicted by an 1RSB calculations. Such a conclusion has positive consequences on the\nuse of simulated annealing and related techniques for the search of low energy solutions in\nhard combinatorial problems.\nHowever, the situation is not always like the one just described. In some cases, eG (T ) >\nes (T ) for all temperatures below Td (see the sketch in the inset of Fig. 5). This is what actually\nhappens for p-spin models with small connectivities, as will be shown in the next Section.\n\n3\n\nFinite connectivity and numerical simulations\n\nFinite connectivity mean-field models have been the object of intense investigation in the last\nyears. On one hand, they are thought to share some properties of finite-dimensional models\n(namely each spin interact with a finite number of neighbors). On the other hand, they are\nclosely related to extremely hard combinatorial optimization problems [14]. Nevertheless, up to\nnow, the theoretical investigations have been limited to the 1RSB level [15, 16]. Here we want\nto show how the 1RSB phase becomes unstable with respect to 2RSB fluctuations, and how\nto compute the stability threshold. We expect that, as usual, once the 1RSB phase becomes\nunstable, FRSB has to be used for properly describing the system.\nFor sake of simplicity, we present our calculation in a particularly simple case, which allows\na fully explicit derivation. We shall comment later on the generalizations of our results. To\nbe definite, let us consider a fixed-connectivity Ising model with p-spin interactions (hereafter\np > 2) with Hamiltonian\nX\nH(\u03c3) = \u2212\nJi1 ...ip \u03c3i1 . . . \u03c3ip .\n(3.1)\n(i1 ...ip )\u2208G\n\n\u0001\nIn the above formula G is the hypergraph of interactions, i.e. a set of M among the Np\npossible p-uples of the N spins. Here we shall take G to have fixed connectivity: each spin is\nsupposed to participate to (l + 1) interaction terms. Finally we shall consider the couplings\nJi1 ...ip to take the values \u00b11 with equal probability.\nUnder these hypothesis the 2RSB order parameter is a normalized measure on a space of\nprobability distributions and does not depend upon the site of the sample [17]. The mean-field\nb \u03c1]. At\nequations are most conveniently written in terms of two such measures: Q[\u03c1] and Q[b\nzero temperature they have the form\nZ Y\nl\ni\nh\n1\nb \u03c1(\u03b1) ] z[{b\nQ[\u03c1] =\ndQ[b\n\u03c1(\u03b1) }] ,\n\u03c1(\u03b1) }]\u03bc1 /\u03bc2 \u03b4 \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1(0) [{b\nZ \u03b1=1\nZ p\u22121\nh\ni\nY\nb\nQ[b\n\u03c1] =\ndQ[\u03c1(i) ] \u03b4 \u03c1b \u2212 \u03c1b(0) [{\u03c1(i) }] ,\ni=1\n\n8\n\n(3.2)\n\n(3.3)\n\n\fwhere Z is a normalization constant and 0 < \u03bc1 \u2264 \u03bc2 < \u221e are the 2RSB parameters in the \u03b2 \u2192\n\u221e limit. The probability distribution \u03c1b is supported over the integers q such that \u22121 \u2264 q \u2264 +1.\n\u03c1+ , \u03c1b0 , \u03c1b\u2212 } (with \u03c1b+ +b\n\u03c10 +b\n\u03c1\u2212 = 1).\nIt is therefore given in terms of three positive numbers: \u03c1b = {b\nThe distribution \u03c1 is instead supported over the integers \u2212l \u2264 q \u2264 l.

The physical stability of the 1RSB phase coincides with the stability of this\nsolution under the iteration (3.2)-(3.3). We must therefore consider how the 2RSB order\nb \u03c1] can reduce to the 1RSB solution (3.6):\nparameters Q[\u03c1], Q[b\nb \u03c1] concentrate around \u03c1\u2217 , \u03c1b\u2217 :\n\u2022 The first possibility is that Q[\u03c1] and Q[b\nb \u03c1] \u2248 fb(b\n\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1b\u2217 ) ,\nQ[b\n\nQ[\u03c1] \u2248 f (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u2217 ) ,\n\n(3.7)\n\nwhere f (*) and fb(*) are supported in a neighborhood of 0.

This type of instability is\ntherefore irrelevant for the problem under study.\nb \u03c1] concentrate around delta\u2022 The second possibility is that the functionals Q[\u03c1] and Q[b\nfunction distributions:\nQ[\u03c1] \u2248 \u03c1\u2217+ f+ [\u03c1 \u2212 \u03b4+ ] + \u03c1\u22170 f0 [\u03c1 \u2212 \u03b4 0 ] + \u03c1\u2217\u2212 f\u2212 [\u03c1 \u2212 \u03b4 \u2212 ] ,\n\n(3.10)\n\nb \u03c1]. In the above expression the distributions fq [*] are supported\nand analogously for Q[b\naround 0, and \u03b4 + (respectively \u03b4 0 , \u03b4\u2212 ) is the distribution {1, 0, 0} (respectively {0, 1, 0},\nb \u03c1] concentrate over the corners of the\n{0, 0, 1}). In other words the measures Q[\u03c1] and Q[b\nsimplex, with weights given by the 1RSB solution.\nIn order to derive the stability condition it is convenient to use variables which are small\nnear the corners of the simplex. One possible choice is to rewrite the distributions fq [*]\nas functions of the variables\n\u01eb\u00b1 = \u03c1\u00b1 \u2212 \u03b4q,\u00b1 ,\n\n(3.11)\n\nand analogously for the distributions fbq [*]. Notice that two variables are sufficient because\nof the normalization constraint. Moreover the signs of \u01eb+ , \u01eb\u2212 are fixed by the value of q.\nIt is now easy to linearize the equations for fq [*], fbq [*] in the limit \u01eb\u00b1 \u226a 1. If we define\nh\u01eb\u00b1 iq (respectively hb\n\u01eb\u00b1 iqb), the average of \u01eb\u00b1 (b\n\u01eb\u00b1 ) with respect to fq [*] (fbqb[*]), we get the\nequations\nX\nX\nTbqb\u03c3b ,q\u03c3 h\u01eb\u03c3 iq ,\n(3.12)\nh\u01eb\u03c3 iq \u2248 l\nTq\u03c3,bq\u03c3b hb\n\u01eb\u03c3b iqb ,\nhb\n\u01eb\u03c3b iqb \u2248 (p \u2212 1)\nq,\u03c3\n\nqb,b\n\u03c3\n\nwhere the sums over q and qb run over {+, 0, \u2212}, while the ones over \u03c3 and \u03c3\nb run over\nb\n{+, \u2212}. Explicit formulae for the 6 \u00d7 6 matrices T and T are reported in App. A. As\nbefore, we look for the eigenvalue of the product T * Tb which has the largest absolute\nvalue. If we call \u03c9MAX this eigenvalue, the stability criterion is\nl(p \u2212 1) * |\u03c9MAX | < 1 .\n\n(3.13)\n\nIt turns out that \u03c9MAX depends uniquely on the parameter \u03bc2 , which can be identified\nas the 1RSB parameter. This criterion, unlike (3.9), has a non-trivial content which we\nshall consider in the following.\nThe criterion (3.13) select a range of the 1RSB parameter for which the 1RSB solution is\nstable. This range has the form \u03bc > \u03bcG . Using the relation between \u03bc and the energy e of\nmetastable states [7], see also the previous Section, one can convert this condition as an energy\ncondition of the form e < eG . This confirms our general picture summarized in Fig. 1.\nIn Table 1 we exemplify the general situation by considering the case p = 3. In the low\nconnectivity regime (l + 1) \u2264 10 we have es < eG < ed strictly: the ground state is correctly\ndescribed by 1RSB while high-lying metastable states are unstable to FRSB. The expected\ntemperature dependence of ed in this regime of connectivities, is sketched in the inset of Fig.\n5. At higher connectivities the ground state becomes unstable too: eG < es < ed .

Sec. 2. Moreover, for\neven connectivities, the instability point corresponds to the vanishing of the 0-component of\nthe 1RSB parameter \u03c1b0\u2217 , and thus the ground state become unstable when \u03c1b0\u2217 (\u03bcs ) becomes\npositive.\nFor (l + 1) \u2264 10, we are in the case depicted in the inset of Fig. 5, since the instability\nenergy eG lies above the ground state energy es . In this situation there is a lower bound on\nthe energy reachable by simulated annealing (and presumably by any local search algorithm\nrunning in a time polynomial in N ) which is strictly above the ground state energy, and the\nproblem of finding the ground state is hard and not approximable [18].\nWe have verified this prediction by running long simulated annealings on a large instance\nof the 3-spin model with fixed connectivities 5 and 6. The results are shown in Fig. 6, different\ncurves corresponding to different cooling rates. For both connectivities, the energies reachable\nby simulated annealing are clearly below the threshold energy ed predicted with the 1RSB\nAnsatz. Moreover the extrapolations to infinitely slow cooling rates are perfectly compatible\nwith the energy eG , thus suggesting that the complexity coming from the FRSB solution at\nx > m should be tiny.\nAny fixed-connectivity p-spin Ising model is therefore FRSB for what concerns dynamic\nstates. Another interesting class of diluted mean-field models consists of models defined on\nrandom hypergraphs with Poissonian connectivity.

The zero-temperature phase\ndiagram for these models in 1RSB approximation is sketched in Fig. 7 (we recall that, for both\nthese models, energies are always positive defined). Glassy metastable states develop above\nthe average connectivity \u03b1d and have energy densities between es (\u03b1) and ed (\u03b1). The ground\nstate energy es (\u03b1) becomes positive at \u03b1s (> \u03b1d ). A quite natural conjecture for the energy\nabove which FRSB sets in, eG (\u03b1), is reported with a dashed line. We have es < eG < ed for\n\u03b1d < \u03b1 < \u03b1G , and eG < es < ed for \u03b1 > \u03b1G . The calculation of the eG (\u03b1) curve will be\npresented in a forthcoming publication [25].\n\nAcknowledgments\nIt is a pleasure to thank Marc M\u00e9zard for his interest in our work.
