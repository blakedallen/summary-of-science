Introduction\nPlasmonic waveguides have recently attracted much attention due to their ability to confine\nlight beyond the diffraction limit [1], therefore potentially enabling device integration on a\nscale which is not accessible with conventional dielectric waveguides or photonic crystal\nwaveguides. To date, various plasmonic waveguide structures have been proposed and\ninvestigated for planar photonic integration [2-5]. In general most plasmonic waveguides can\nbe classified into three basic types: insulator-metal-insulator (IMI), insulator-metal (IM) and\nmetal-insulator-metal (MIM). In the optical regime, especially in the infrared, light in IMI\nand IM types of plasmonic waveguides penetrates into the insulator over several wavelengths,\nso the mode profile in these two types is still quite large. In contrast, the MIM type can\nprovide true sub diffraction confinement when the width of the insulator is very small, and in\nprinciple, is not limited by a cut off. Thus the MIM type of plasmonic waveguides is the ideal\ncandidate for true subwavelength photonic integration, albeit the loss is larger than the other\ntwo types.\nTo realize subwavelength photonic integration based on the plasmonic platform,\nguidance of light with nanoscale confinement is required, but more importantly some\nfunctionalities, e.g. filtering, routing and multiplexing, have to be realized on the same\nplatform. One of the devices that can provide such functionalities is a resonator, which can\nfilter specific wavelengths from an input signal. Filters based on Bragg gratings in MIM\nwaveguides have been investigated in the literature [6]; however, these devices require a\nrelatively large length because a large number of Bragg periods is needed. The recently\n\n2\n\n\fproposed tooth-shaped plasmonic waveguide filter is shorter [7], but the bandwidth is too\nlarge for filtering applications.\nConsidering that light can propagate through sharp bends in MIM waveguides with high\ntransmission [3] [8], MIM waveguides are ideal candidates for constructing ring resonators,\nin which the bending loss is negligible and ring resonators with subwavelength radii can be\nachieved. Using MIM waveguides, resonators with very short round trip length Lrt can be\nrealized. A shorter Lrt is preferable for plasmonic ring resonators due to a lower propagation\nloss inside the resonator. In addition, a short Lrt results in a large free spectral range (FSR),\nwhich is desirable for filters in wavelength-division-multiplexing applications [9]. In ref [10]\nplasmonic ring resonators based on the regular circular geometry were theoretically\ninvestigated and ring resonators based on channel plasmonic waveguides were reported in ref\n[5]. However, all these resonators suffer from a relatively low extinction ratio. To show one\nof these results, Fig.1 gives the calculated transmission spectrum for a MIM ring resonator\nwith a radius of 500nm evanescently coupled to a MIM bus waveguide. The spectrum was\nobtained using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method [11] with convolutional\nperfectly matched layer (CPML) boundary conditions. The index of the insulator is assumed\nto be 1.45, which is the typical index of SiO2 or some polymers in the infrared region. The\nmetal is silver, with the permittivity described by Drude model\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\uf065 r \uf03d \uf065 \uf0a5 \uf02d \uf077 p /( \uf077 \uf02b j\uf067\uf077 ) ,\n\nwith\n\n\uf065\uf0a5 = 3.7, \uf077p = 9.1eV and \uf067 = 0.018eV, which were obtained by fitting the experimental data\n[12] for silver permittivity in the infrared frequencies. Both the bus waveguide and the ring\nresonator have an insulator width of 100nm and the gap between them is 25nm, which should\n\n3\n\n\fbe realizable and controllable with state-of-the-art electron beam lithography or focused ion\nbeam lithography.\nFrom Fig.1 we can see that for resonant wavelengths in the range between 1\uf06dm and\n2.25\uf020\uf06dm, the extinction ratio for this circular MIM ring resonator is very small, less than 5dB.\nSuch a low extinction ratio limits the application of this ring resonator; however, the reasons\nfor the low extinction ratios have not been analyzed in the literature. In section 2 of this paper,\nwe will give a comprehensive analysis to show why the extinction ratio is so small and how it\ncan be improved. We note that although the transmission of an all pass ring resonator has\nbeen given in ref [13], it was assumed therein that there is no loss in the coupling region,\nwhich is not true in the plasmonic device. In section 2 we present an analysis for a universal\nall pass ring resonator where loss exists in the coupling region. Based on the analysis, we\npropose in section 3 a MIM racetrack resonator with significantly improved extinction\nperformance. We note that although the analysis and design presented in section 3 is for MIM\nwaveguides, it can also be extended to other plasmonic waveguide systems. Moreover, the\nanalysis in section 2 is not restricted to MIM resonators, but is applicable to any resonators\nand can be used as a guideline for designing of all types of plasmonic resonators with high\nextinction ratios. The paper concludes in section 4.\n2. Analysis of a universal all-pass ring resonator\nThe schematic of a universal all-pass ring resonator is shown in Fig.2. When the\ncoupling region has loss and non-zero physical length, the coupling coefficient \uf06b\uf020and\n2\n\ntransmission coefficient \uf074 \uf03d \uf074 e i\uf066\uf074 are both complex numbers, and we assume \uf074 \uf02b \uf06b\n\n2\n\n\uf03d\uf062,\n\nwhere \uf062 may not be equal to 1. The coupling relation can be described by the matrix:\n\n4\n\n\fb1\nb2\n\n\uf03d\n\n\uf074\n\n\uf06b a1\n\uf02d \uf06b * \uf074 * a2\n\n(1)\n\nand the transmission around the resonator is given by\n\na 2 \uf03d \uf061e i\uf071 b 2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the real number \uf061 is the inner circulation factor describing the internal loss, with \uf061\n= 1 when there is no internal loss, and \uf071 is the round trip phase.\nFrom (1) and (2), we can get:\n\nb1 \uf03d\n\n\uf02d \uf061\uf062 \uf02b \uf074e \uf02d i\uf071\na1\n\uf02d \uf061\uf074 * \uf02b e \uf02di\uf071\n\na2 \uf03d\n\n\uf02d \uf061\uf06b *\na1\n\uf02d \uf061\uf074 * \uf02b e \uf02di\uf071\n\nSo the transmission is:\n\nT\uf03d\n\nb1\na1\n\n2\n2\n\n2\n\n\uf03d\n\n\uf062 2\uf061 2 \uf02b \uf074 \uf02d 2\uf061\uf062 \uf074 cos(\uf071 \uf02b \uf066\uf074 )\n2\n\n1 \uf02b \uf061 2 \uf074 \uf02d 2\uf061 \uf074 cos(\uf071 \uf02b \uf066\uf074 )\n\n(3)\n\nFrom equation (3) one obtains the transmission at resonance ( \uf071 \uf02b \uf066\uf074 \uf03d 2m\uf070 , m is an\ninteger) as:\nT\uf03d\n\n(\uf061\uf062 \uf02d \uf074 ) 2\n(1 \uf02d \uf061 \uf074 ) 2\n\n(4)\n\nSo the condition for critical coupling in ref [13] is now changed to \uf061\uf062 \uf03d \uf074 , which\ndetermines the extinction ratio for a universal all-pass resonator. Compared to dielectric ring\nresonators, plasmonic waveguides suffer from more loss in the ring and there is also some\nloss in the coupling region, so that \uf061\uf020and \uf062\uf020are relatively smaller than in the dielectric\nstructures (\uf062\uf03d\uf031\uf02e\uf030\uf020for dielectric waveguide). Furthermore, \uf074\n\nis larger in the plasmonic\n\ndevice because more power goes through the straight bus waveguide due to the weak\ncoupling. These two conditions make the deviation between\uf020\uf061\uf062 and \uf074 for a plasmonic\nresonator larger than that for dielectric resonators. This is the origin of the low extinction\n\n5\n\n\fratio in MIM plasmonic resonators. In the following part, we will give specific values of \uf020\uf061\uf062\nand \uf074 to show the deviation between them. One can also conclude that for plasmonic\nresonators, a stronger coupling is required to achieve a high extinction ratio due to the loss.\nThe key to increasing the extinction ratio of MIM ring resonators is to reduce the deviation\nbetween \uf061\uf062 and \uf074 at resonant wavelengths. Some approaches, e.g. aperture-coupling [14],\nhave been proposed to meet this requirement. Since light coupling between two waveguides\nis proportional to the coupling length, we propose in this paper MIM ring resonators with\nincreased coupling length, i.e. plasmonic racetrack resonators based on MIM waveguides.\nWe first show how the deviation between \uf061\uf062 and \uf074 can be reduced in the racetrack\nresonator at 1550nm. For simplicity, we assume the effective index of the bent MIM\n\uf02d\n\nwaveguide is the same as that of the straight MIM waveguide, so \uf061 equals to e\n\n2\uf070\n\n\uf06c0\n\nn\" Lrt\n\n, where\n\n\uf06c0 = 1550nm is the free space wavelength, n \" is the imaginary part of the effective index in\nthe MIM waveguides, Lrt \uf03d 2(\uf070R \uf02b L) is the round trip length of the racetrack resonator\nwhere R is the radius of the ring and L is the length of the coupling region. By solving the\ndispersion equation of a MIM waveguide at 1550nm with the insulator width set at 100nm\nand its index equal to 1.45, we obtain neff \uf03d n ' \uf02b n\" j \uf03d 1.747 \uf02b 0.00327 j , which corresponds to\nthe propagation length in both the resonator and bus waveguide to be 37.72\uf06dm (the loss is\n0.115dB/\uf020\uf06dm). The relation between \uf061 in the racetrack resonator and coupling region\nlength L can be obtained. To calculate \uf074\uf02c\uf020\uf06b\uf020and \uf062\uf02c\uf020we simulate the coupling region\nseparately as shown in the inset in Fig. 3(a) using FDTD. The material parameters are the\nsame as given above. A continuous wave at 1550nm is launched from the left port of the\nstraight waveguide and the simulation is run until the fields become stable. The magnetic\n\n6\n\n\ffields at planes A and B are used to calculate \uf074\uf020, \uf06b\uf020\uf020with the magnetic field at plane A without\nthe upper waveguide used as the reference. Fig. 3(a) gives the result for \uf074\uf020and \uf06b\uf020as well as \uf061\uf062\nfor different coupling lengths.\nFrom the result we can see that as the length increases, the coupling between the two\nwaveguide becomes stronger and the deviation between \uf074\uf020and \uf061\uf062\uf020decreases. When the length\nL reaches approximately 670nm, \uf074\uf020equals to \uf061\uf062\uf020and when L exceeds 670nm, the deviation\nbetween \uf074\uf020and \uf061\uf062\uf020starts to increase again, resulting in a state of \"over coupling\". Fig. 3(a)\nalso shows that when L equals 0, which corresponds to the case for the coupling in a circular\nplasmonic resonator as shown in the inset of Fig. 1, \uf074\uf020is 0.9922 while \uf061\uf062\uf020is 0.9551. Thus\naccording to equation (4), T equals to 59.1% or -2.3 dB at resonance. This result is consistent\nwith the result shown in Fig. 1 obtained with the FDTD method.\n3. Proposal and numerical results.\nThe result in Fig.3 (a) shows that when the length of the coupling region approaches\n670nm, a state close to critical coupling can be realized and this can be used to design a\nresonator with a much higher extinction ratio. The schematic of such a plasmonic resonator\nwith increased coupling length, or racetrack plasmonic resonator, is shown as inset in Fig\n3(b). The FDTD method is again used to simulate the structure and the calculated result is\nshown in Fig. 3(b). One sees that the extinction ratio around 1.55\uf06dm has been significantly\nincreased from less than 3dB to around 35dB. It is also seen in Fig. 3(b) that the extinction\nratio at the other resonant wavelengths within the range between 1\uf06dm and 2.25\uf06dm is also\nincreased, although not as significant as it is for the resonant wavelength around 1.55\uf020\uf06dm,\nindicating the condition for critical coupling is less fulfilled for those wavelengths.\n\n7\n\n\fConsidering that the coupling is weaker for longer wavelengths, we believe that it is\nunder-coupling (\uf061\uf062\uf03c\uf074) for wavelengths longer than 1.6\uf020\uf06dm and over-coupling (\uf061\uf062\uf03e\uf074) for\nwavelengths shorter than 1.4\uf020\uf06dm.\nCompared to the value \u2206\uf06cFWHM (full width at half maximum) of 8.1nm obtained for the\ndevice in Fig. 1 at the resonant wavelength 1.386\uf06dm, the value \u2206\uf06cFWHM obtained for the\nracetrack resonator is about 13.6nm around the resonant wavelength 1.565\uf06dm. Considering\nthat \u2206\uf06cFWHM\u2248\n\n\uf06c2\n\uf070neff L rt\n\n1 \uf02d \uf061\uf074\n\n\uf061\uf074\n\n[15], the slight increase in \u2206\uf06cFWHM of the racetrack resonator\n\nindicates that the decrease in \uf074 plays a more important role than the increase in Lrt. We also\nfind that the FSR at around 1.55\uf06dm in the racetrack resonator (387.1nm) is smaller than that\nin the circular resonator (453.6nm), which we believe is mainly due to an increase in Lrt. The\nloaded quality factor for the racetrack resonator at 1.565\uf06dm is found to be around 115. The\nunloaded or intrinsic quality factor for the MIM racetrack resonator at 1.55\uf06dm is calculated to\nbe 267 from the following equation [16]:\n\nQint \uf03d\n\nn'\n2n\"\n\n(5)\n\nThe relative low quality factor is mainly due to the intrinsic loss in the plasmonic waveguide,\nwhich is a common problem for all plasmonic resonator systems and we hope this problem\ncan be solved by introducing e.g. gain medium into the plasmonic waveguides. Compared to\ndielectric ring resonators, e.g. the smallest silicon-on-insulator ring resonator reported to date\nin the literature with a radius of 1.5\uf06dm [17] which has a FSR of 52nm, the proposed MIM\nracetrack resonator has a smaller quality factor, but has a much smaller bending radius and\nlarger FSR while retaining a comparable extinction ratio. We note that the bending radius can\n\n8\n\n\fbe even further reduced due to the high transmission of light through sharp bends in MIM\nwaveguides.\nOne may also notice that the extinction ratio for the resonant wavelength around 1.55\uf020\uf06dm\nis only 34dB while from equation (4) this number should be infinity. Besides the numerical\nerrors, the main reason for this is because the results for coupling shown in Fig. 3(a) is\ncalculated for the 1.55\uf06dm wavelength while the resonant wavelength in Fig. 3(b) is precisely\n1.565\uf06dm. For 1.565\uf06dm \uf061\uf062\uf020and \uf074\uf020are not exactly equal. The small difference slightly degrades\nthe extinction ratio for 1.565\uf06dm; however this can be improved by carefully designing the\nplasmonic racetrack resonator geometry to fulfill both the phase condition and critical\ncoupling condition at the same time. For the result shown in Fig. 3(b), we note that the length\n670nm is still relatively short compared to the resonant wavelength and the footprint of the\nplasmonic racetrack resonator is still very small.\nFig.4 (a) gives a snapshot of the magnetic field profile in the plasmonic racetrack\nresonator at the resonant wavelength 1.565\uf06dm. As can be seen in the figure, the field in the\noutput port of the bus waveguide is very weak, showing that complete destructive\ninterference is obtained at the output port. To assess the sensitivity of the extinction ratio to\nvariations in the length of the coupling region, we performed a set of simulations in which the\nlength of the coupling region has some deviations from 670nm. Fig. 4(b) shows the extinction\nratios for different coupling length deviations at around 1.55\uf06dm wavelength. Note that the\nresonant wavelengths have changed a bit from 1.565\uf06dm because Lrt has changed. As is seen,\nthe extinction ratio is slightly degraded, which can be easily understood because the coupling\n\n9\n\n\fis deviated from the critical coupling discussed in section 2. However, the extinction ratio is\nstill much higher (>20dB) than the result obtained for the circular MIM resonators.\n4. Conclusion\nIn summary, we presented in this paper a comprehensive analysis to elucidate the cause\nfor the poor performance of circular plasmonic ring resonators, gave the transmission relation\nin a universal all-pass resonator where coupling loss exists and then proposed and\ninvestigated the racetrack MIM resonators. The simulation results show that the proposed\nracetrack resonators have significant improvement in extinction ratio over the circular MIM\nring resonator. Although we focus on plasmonic resonators based on MIM waveguides as an\nexample, our analysis can be used as a guideline for the design of other kinds of high\nperformance plasmonic resonators. Besides the all-pass resonator, the idea of racetrack MIM\nresonators can be extended to other resonator systems, e.g. add-drop plasmonic resonator and\nfind extensive applications in the field of plasmonic devices. These devices will help realize\nmore functionality on the plasmonic platform.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of\nCanada. Z.
