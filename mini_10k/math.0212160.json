The second point\nof view then enables to build Q1 knowing H1 . The finite dimensional AmbroseSinger theorem [1] states that the Lie algebra of the holonomy group is spanned\nDate: 12/12/2002.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJEAN-PIERRE MAGNOT\n\nby the curvature elements. Basic facts about the holonomy in finite dimensions are\nrecalled in section 3.\nIn a paper of 1988, Freed [3] claimed that there was no adequate Ambrose-Singer\ntheorem to deal with the Chern form he was defining on loop groups. Ten years\nbefore, answering to a question raised by Penot [12], Vassiliou [14] showed how far\nthe original proof of Ambrose and Singer could be generalized to Banach bundles.\nA crucial ingredient of this proof is that the holonomy group defined from the point\nof view 2) is already a Lie subgroup of G in the sense of Bourbaki, and this paper\nis also based on a careful application to the Frobenius theorem on Banach vector\nbundles. But this generalization does not fit with Freed's framework. Our purpose\nhere is to give an infinite-dimensional generalization of the concept of holonomy\ngroup, holonomy bundle and of the Ambrose-Singer theorem that fits with Freed's\nframework.\nSince we want to consider the framework which is as general as possible, we need\nto take under consideration not only Banach Lie groups, but also some Lie groups\nG modelled on complete locally convex topological spaces. The principal bundle P\nand the basis manifold M are assumed to be modelled on locally convex topological\nspaces.\nWe remark that there is no adequate Frobenius theorem in this framework.\nMoreover, to our knowledge, there was no proved theorem of reduction for a fixed\nconnection \u03b8. Thus, our approach of the problem of defining the Holonomy group\nand the Holonomy bundle, which is based on a definition of the holonomy group\nwith respect to the point of view 1), is the following :\n- first, we give a theorem to decide whether a connection can reduce while reducing the structure group of the principal bundle in section 4.\n- Then, we define if it exists the holonomy group H red (resp. the restricted\nholonomy group H0red ) as the structure group (resp. the connected component of\nthe structure group) of the smaller principal bundle where the connection reduces.\n- Finally, using results from Robart [13] that we recall in section 1, and remarking that we can restrict the existence of the holonomy group to the problem of\nenlargeability of a Lie algebra which is minimal for inclusion, we show that we can\ndefine the closed restricted holonomy group (section 5) and the closed holonomy\ngroup (section 6) when the structure group G belongs to the classes defined in [13].\nThe Lie groups H red and H0red contain the restricted holonomy group and the\nholonomy group defined by the approach 2), but the approaches 1) and 2) do not\nseem to be equivalent in infinite dimensions. However, we do not have any example\nwhere the approaches 1) and 2) define different holonomy groups. This question\nremains open, and we make final remarks in chapter 7 that could lead to understand\nbetter the relationship between these two approaches.\nIn another paper [9], we will show how these constructions fit to the question\nabout the holonomy in infinite dimensions raised by Freed [3].\n1. Enlargeable Lie algebras\nOne great problem in the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras in infinite dimensions is to decide whether a Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of a Lie group. In this\narticle, all the Lie groups are assumed to be modelled on complete locally convex\nvector spaces. We recall in this section some results, that can be found in [13].\n\n\fSTRUCTURE GROUPS AND HOLONOMY IN INFINITE DIMENSIONS\n\n3\n\nRecall that, in the sense of Bourbaki [2], H is a Lie subgoup of a Lie group G if\nand only if it is a closed subgroup of G and the Lie algebra h of H splits the Lie\nalgebra g topologicaly. It is rarely the case. That is why we prefer the following\ndefinition of Lie subgroups that is used e.g. in [13]:\nDefinition 1.1. Let G be a Lie group and H be a subgroup of G. Then, H is a\nLie subgroup of G if and only if\n- H is a Lie group\n- the inclusion H \u2282 G is a morphism of Lie groups.\nWe have the analogous definition for Lie subalgebras:\nDefinition 1.2. Let g be a Lie algebra and h be an (algebraic) vector subspace of\ng which is stable under the Lie bracket [., .] of g. Then, h is a Lie subalgebra of g\nif and only if\n- the topology of h is stronger that the topology of g, i.e. the inclusion h \u2282 g is\na morphism of topological vector spaces.\n- the Lie bracket [., .] is continuous as a map h \u00d7 h \u2192 h with respect to the\ntopology of h.\nLet us first restrict ourselves to the following class of Lie groups.\nDefinition 1.3. ([11], [10], see e.g. [13])\nA Lie group G of Lie algebra g is Omori-Milnor regular (or regular for short) if\nand only if\n1) for any v \u2208 C \u221e ([0, 1], g), the differential equation\ng \u22121\n\ndg(t)\n= v(t)\ndt\n\nhas an unique smooth solution \u03b3v .\n2) the map v 7\u2192 \u03b3v (1) is smooth for the topology of uniform comvergence in\nC \u221e ([0, 1], g).\n3) \u03b3v is obtained by product integral in G (see [11] for the definition of the product\nintegral).\nActually, we do not know if there exists a Lie group which is not regular. On\na regular Lie group, the exponenial map is defined but there are examples where\nit is not locally injective nor locally surjective [11], see e.g. [10]. In this article,\nwe consider only such groups. In this context, the tangent space T G is trivial, i.e.\nT G \u223c G \u00d7 g,\nLet us now give some results about the following problem: let G be a regular\nLie group with Lie algebra g. Let h be a Lie subalgebra of g. When is there a Lie\ngroup H of Lie algebra h which is a Lie subgroup of G ? For this, let us give the\nfollowing definitions:\nDefinition 1.4. [13]\n1) A Lie algebra is called CBH if and only if its Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff serie\n\u0011\n1\n1\u0010\n(v, w) \u2208 U \u00d7 U 7\u2192 hv (w) = v + w + [v, w] +\n[v, [v, w]] \u2212 [w, [v, w]] + ...\n2\n12\nis analytic on U \u00d7 U , where U is a neighborhood of 0 in g, that is if and only if the\nCampbell-Baker-Hausdorff serie converges for any (v, w) \u2208 U \u00d7 U .\nA Lie group is called CBH if and only if its Lie algebra is CBH.\n\n\f4\n\nJEAN-PIERRE MAGNOT\n\n2 ) A Lie group G is of the first type if and only if the exponential map furnishes a\nchart at the neighborhood of the identity.\n3 ) A Lie group G of Lie algebra g is of the second type if and only if g decomposes\nas a sum of Lie algebras\ng = \u2295m\ni=1 gm\nand the exponential map furnishes a chart at the neighborhood of the identity by\nthe map\nm\nY\nexp(vi ) \u2208 G.\n(v1 , ...vm ) \u2208 g1 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 gm 7\u2192\ni=1\n\nA CBH Lie group is of the first type, and a group of the first type is of the second\ntype. For examples of CBH Lie groups, see [13] and also [7].\nLet us now give the results of [13] we shall use in this article. Recall that, if h\nis a Lie subalgebra of g, we do not assume a priori that h is closed in g, nor the\nexistence of a topological splitting.\nTheorem 1.5. Let h be a Lie subalgebra of g, and assume that g is the Lie algebra\nof a Lie group G. In the following cases:\n1) If G is CBH and h is closed in g,\n2) If G is CBH and h is CBH,\n3) If G is of the first type and h is closed in g,\n4) If G is of the second type and h is closed in g,\nthere is an unique connected Lie subgroup H of G, of the same type as G, that has\nh as Lie algebra.\nLet us now give the following (easy but useful) lemma:\nLemma 1.6. Let g be a Lie algebra. Let X \u2282 g be a topological space, with\ncontinuous inclusion. Let A be a set of the closed subalgebras h \u2282 g such that\nX \u2282 h \u2282 g.\nThen, A has an unique minimal element for the inclusion.\nThe proof of this lemma is straightforward, taking as minimal element\nh0 = \u2229h\u2208A h,\nwhich is a closed subalgebra of g.\n2. Structure groups\nIn all the article, P is a principal bundle, with basis M and with structure Lie\ngroup G, of Lie algebra g = Te G. Let \u03c0 be the fiberwise projection from P on\nM . We do not specify first the model spaces of these manifolds. They can be\nHilbert, Banach, Frechet, locally convex topological spaces, or even take place in\nthe \"convenient setting\" [6]. All the differentiable structures are assumed to be\nsmooth. We recall that a connection \u03b8 on the principal bundle P is a vector bundle\nprojection on the vertical bundle T P \u2192 V T P , and can also be seen as a 1-form on\nT P with values in G which is Ad-invariant. Its curvature, \u03a9, can be also viewed\nfrom these two points of view. Recall that if we have an Ad-invariant map f : P \u2192 g\n( i.e. such that for any p \u2208 P and for any g \u2208 G, f (p.g) = Adg\u22121 f (p)), then the\n\n\fSTRUCTURE GROUPS AND HOLONOMY IN INFINITE DIMENSIONS\n\n5\n\ninduced vertical vector field p 7\u2192 f (p)\u2217 of T P is invariant under the action of G on\nT P . For basic facts on principal bundles, we refer to [6].\n1) On a principal bundle P , using a Lie group morphism \u03c1 : G \u2192 G\u2032 , we build\nthe principal bundle P \u00d7\u03c1 G\u2032 . Then, the connection \u03b8 defines a connection \u03b8\u2032 on\nP \u00d7\u03c1 G\u2032 , see e.g. [5], p. 107-108, or [6] p. 383.\n2) The reduction: Let G1 be a Lie group with Lie algebra g1 , and \u03c1 : G1 \u2192 G\nbe an injective morphism of Lie groups. When we write \u03c1(G1 ) instead of G1 ,\nwe consider the group endowed with the topology and the differentiable structure\ninduced by G, which can be weaker than the initial topology and differentiable\nstructure G1 .\nIf there exists a family of local trivializations of P whose transition functions\ntake their values in \u03c1(G1 ), and that are smooth with respect to the topology of G1\nthen we can build a G1 -bundle P1 with respect to these trivializations. P1 is called\na reduction of P and there is an inclusion i : P1 \u2192 P, which is a morphism of\nprincipal bundles. The connection \u03b8 reduces to P1 if and only if there is a connection\n\u03b81 om P1 that is the pull-back of the connection \u03b8 on P . This is the case when,\non each local trivialization of P defined before, the connection \u03b8 reads as a smooth\nlocal 1-form on M with values in g1 .\nAs one can easily see, the first way of changing the structure group of P is\npossible in any case. The second one, the reduction, requires more attention, and\none of the aims of this article is to provide a tool to decide whether reduction is\npossible in an infinite dimensional setting, and then to extend the finite dimensional\nAmbrose-Singer theorem [1].\nIn order to prove the Ambrose-Singer theorem, we shall also need to change the\nbasis manifold, which is possible by pull back, see e.g. [6], p. 377.: Let N be a\nmanifold and let f : N \u2192 M be a smooth map. Then, one defines f \u2217 P , the pull\nback of the principal bundle P by f , which is a principal bundle with structure\ngroup G and of basis N . Then, a connection \u03b8 always defines a connection f \u2217 \u03b8 on\nf \u2217 P . We use this construction when f is the projection from the universal covering\nN = \u03a3M of M to M . In that case, we write \u03b8\u0303 instead of f \u2217 \u03b8, and the curvature of\n\u03b8\u0303 is the same as the curvature of \u03b8.\n3. Holonomy groups\nLet us fix now a connection \u03b8 on the principal bundle P , with regular structure\ngroup G modelled on a complete locally convex topological vector space and of\nbasis M . We assume that there exists in M a dense countable subset Q, that M is\nmodelled on a locally convex vector space, and that the fundamental group \u03c01 (M )\nis countable.\n3.1. Holonomy induced by horizontal paths. Let p \u2208 P be a fixed point, and\nlet x = \u03c0(p) be the basepoint of p. Let \u03b3 be a piecewise smooth path on M starting\nat x, i.e. \u03b3 : [0, 1] \u2192 M . Then, [6], the differential equation on p\nc(0) = p\n\u03c0(c(t)) = \u03b3(t) for t \u2208 [0, 1]\n\u03b8(dc(t)/dt)\n\n= 0\n\n\f6\n\nJEAN-PIERRE MAGNOT\n\nhas an unique solution called the horizontal lift of \u03b3 in P , that we note by H\u03b3. We\ndefine the Holonomy group from the point of view 2) of the introduction:\nH curv (p) = {g \u2208 G | H\u03b3(1) = p.g, \u03b3(1) = x}.\nGiven two points p, p\u2032 \u2208 P , the holonomy groups H curv (p) and H curv (p\u2032 ) are conjugate in G. If p and p\u2032 can be joint by a horizontal path, H curv (p) = H curv (p\u2032 ), and\nif P is finite dimensional, H curv (p) is a Lie group, which appears to be the smaller\nsubgroup with which one can reduce the structure group of P and also reduce the\nconnection \u03b8. Note that they are often not closed Lie subgroups of G, as shows this\nexample:\nExample: Let P = S 1 \u00d7 S 1 = R2 /Z2 be the trivial principal bundle over S 1\nwith structure group S 1 . We identify each tangent space of P with R2 in the\ncanonical way, the second coordinate being the vertical coordinate. Let us now\nconsider the connection \u03b8 defined by \u03b8 : (x, y) \u2208 R2 7\u2192 \u03b8(x, y) = y + x.\u03c0. Then,\nthe corresponding holonomy group is given by Z[\u03c0]/Z, which is a countable dense\nsubgroup of S 1 = R/Z. The holonomy group is itself a Lie group (of dimension 0),\nbut not a closed Lie subgroup of S 1 .\nIn order to avoid these problems, one can also consider the restricted holonomy\ngroup, the connected component of the neutral element of the holonomy group,\nwhich is obtained considering only the loops in x that are homotopy trivial. From\nanother point of view, the restricted holonomy group is also the holonomy group of\nthe connection \u03b8\u0303 induced by \u03b8 on the pull back of P on the universal covering \u03a3M\nof M . This pull-back can also be done in infinite dimensions.\n3.2. Holonomy, curvature and Ambrose-Singer theorems: known results.\nWe define the horizontal bundle as HT P = Ker(\u03b8). This bundle gives a decomposition T P = HT P \u2295 V T P . The curvature \u03a9 of \u03b8 measures the vertical component\nof the bracket of two sections X, Y of the horizontal bundle, that is, given p \u2208 P ,\n\u03a9p (X, Y ) = \u03b8p ([X, Y ]). One has to be careful because the Lie algebra spanned by\nthe curvature elements needs not to have the same dimension at each point p \u2208 P\n(see e,g. [8], p. 141).\nNevertheless, we have the finite dimensional Ambrose-Singer theorem:\nTheorem 3.1. [1] The Lie algebra of the restricted holonomy group at p \u2208 P is\nspanned by the curvature elements.\nLet us precise the following: by \"curvature elements\", we understand the curvature elements \u03a9p\u2032 (X, Y ), where p\u2032 \u2208 P can be joint to p by a horizontal path, and\nX, Y \u2208 T\u03c0(p\u2032 ) M . The proof of this theorem uses two tools : the first one is that the\nrestricted holonomy group is finite dimensional. The second one is the Frobenius\ntheorem for vector bundles. Such a theorem was not yet proved in infinite dimension, except on a particular case of holonomy group embedded in a Banach Lie\ngroup in [14]. In this article, the very strong assumptions on the holonomy group\nreplaces the finite dimensional setting, which leads the author to apply very easily\nthe Frobenius theorem for Banach vector bundles.\nIn our setting, there is no Frobenius theorem, and we want to consider all the\nconnections that exist on P . This is the reason why our approach is quite different.\n\n\fSTRUCTURE GROUPS AND HOLONOMY IN INFINITE DIMENSIONS\n\n7\n\n4. Reduction of the structure group\nLet us first consider the following question: given a Lie subgroup G1 , with Lie\nalgebra g1 , of G, when is it possible to reduce the bundle P to a principal bundle\nP1 with structure group G1 ? The most famous condition, in finite dimension and\nif the basis manifold is simply connected, is the existence of a connection with g1 valued curvature. This result is of course linked with the finite-dimensional proof of\nthe Ambrose-Singer theorem. We prove here an infinite dimensional version of the\ntheorem of reduction. This allows us, in the next chapter, to deal with an infinite\ndimensional construction of the holonomy groups from the point of view 1) of the\nintroduction. In the following, p is a fixed point in P with basepoint x in M .\nTheorem 4.1. We assume that G1 and G are regular Lie groups and that G1 is\nmodelled on a complete locally convex topological vector space. Let \u03c1 : G1 7\u2192 G\nbe an injective morphism of Lie groups, if there exists \u03b8 a connection on P , with\ncurvature \u03a9, such that, for any smooth 1-parameter family Hct of horizontal paths\nstarting at p, for any smooth vector fields X, Y in T M ,\n(4.1)\n\ns, t \u2208 [0, 1]2\n\n\u2192 \u03a9ct (s) (X, Y )\n\nis a smooth g1 -valued map, and if M is simply connected, then it is possible to\nreduce the structure group G of P to G1 .\nWe shall of course try to apply this theorem to find an infinite dimensional version\nof the Ambrose-Singer theorem. Let us first give a remark that makes easier the\napplication of this theorem in concrete situations:\nRemark 4.2. If g1 is stable under the adjoint action of G, the map 4.1 is a smooth\ng1 -valued map for any 1-parameter family Hct of horizontal paths if and only if on\nany local trivialization of P , the curvature \u03a9 reads as a smooth g1 -valued 2-form.\nOtherwise, it is sufficient to find a family of local trivializations of P induced by an\nopen covering of M for which the curvature \u03a9 reads as a smooth g1 -valued 2-form.\nBefore giving the proof of this theorem, we need three lemmas, which are wellknown results in finite dimensions (see e.g. [8]). Following [6], if Cx\u221e ([0, 1], M ) is\nthe set of smooth paths on M starting at x, we note\nP t : Cx\u221e ([0, 1], M ) \u00d7 [0, 1] \u00d7 \u03c0 \u22121 (x) \u2192 P\nthe parallel transport with respect to \u03b8, which is a smooth map.\nLemma 4.3. Let p \u2208 P . Let x be the basepoint of p. Let U be a star-shaped\nneighborhood of x, that we idendify in sake of simplicity for this lemma with a starshaped neighborhood of 0 in the model space of M . We assume that U is contained\nin the domain V of a smooth trivialization \u03c6 : P|V \u2192 V \u00d7 G of P Let u \u2208 U and\nt \u2208 [0, 1]. We define f (u, t) = tu \u2208 U .\nLet\n\u03c8:U\n\n\u2192 P|U\n\nu 7\u2192 P t(f (u, .), 1, p)\nLet\n\u03a8 : U \u00d7 G \u2192 P|U\n(u, g) 7\u2192 \u03c8(u).g\n\n\f8\n\nJEAN-PIERRE MAGNOT\n\nand\n\u03a8\u0303 = \u03a8 \u25e6 (IdU \u00d7 \u03c1).\nThen, \u03a8 is a local trivialization of P over U . Moreover, \u03b8 \u25e6 D\u03c8 is a smooth\ng1 -valued form on U .\nWe need now to know how the horizontal lifts of paths behave in this trivialization.\nLemma 4.4. We use here the notations of the two last lemmas. We assume also\nthat U is convex.\n(i) Given a path \u03b1 : [0, 1] \u2192 U starting at x, if H\u03b1 is its horizintal lift starting at\np, we have H\u03b1(1) \u2208 \u03a8(U \u00d7 \u03c1(G1 )), and there exists a path H\u03b11 : [0, 1] \u2192 U \u00d7 G1\nsuch that H\u03b1 = \u03a8\u0303 \u25e6 H\u03b11 .\n(ii) Let h : [0, 1]2 \u2192 U be an homotopy equivalence between two paths h(0, .) and\nh(1, .) starting at x and finishing in U . Let Hh(0, .) and Hh(1, .) be their horizontal lifts starting at p. Then, there is g1 \u2208 G1 such that \u03a8\u0303\u22121 (Hh(0, 1)) =\n\u03a8\u0303\u22121 (Hh(1, 1)).\u03c1(g1 ).\nThen, the following lemma will be useful when dealing with homotopy:\nLemma 4.5. Let \u03b1 and \u03b2 be two paths on U . Let q\u03b1 \u2208 \u03c0 \u22121 (\u03b1(0)) and q\u03b2 \u2208\n\u03c0 \u22121 (\u03b2(0)). Let H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 be the horizotal lifts of \u03b1 and \u03b2 starting at q\u03b1 and q\u03b2 .\nWe set \u03a8\u0303\u22121 \u25e6 H\u03b1 = (\u03b1, \u03b3\u03b1 ) and \u03a8\u22121 \u25e6 H\u03b2 = (\u03b2, \u03b3\u03b2 ).\nLet g = \u03b3\u03b2\u22121 (0).\u03b3\u03b1 (0), with \u22121 as the inverse map in G. Then, for any t \u2208 [0, 1],\nthere exists g1 (t), g1\u2032 \u2208 G1 such that \u03b3\u03b2 (t) = \u03b3\u03b1 (t).g1\u22121 (t).g.g1\u2032 (t). Moreover, the\nmaps t 7\u2192 g1 (t) and t 7\u2192 g1\u2032 (t) are smooth in G1 .\nLet us now give the proofs of the three lemmas, and then the proof of Theorem 4.1:\nProof of Lemma 4.3:\nWe already know that \u03a8 is a smooth map, since P t is smooth. We also know\nthat \u03c8 is a smooth injective map, and that \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c8 = IdU . Hence, \u03a8 is a smooth\nlocal trivialization of P over U .\nLet us calculate D\u03a8\u22121 \u25e6 \u03b8 \u25e6 D\u03c8.

Since\n[0, 1]2 is compact, there exists M, N \u2208 N such that, for each i \u2208 {0, ..., M \u2212 1} and\nj \u2208 {0, ..., N \u2212 1}, there is a multiindex c(i, j) (of any order) such that h([i/M, (i +\n1)/M ] \u00d7 [j/N, (j + 1)/N ]) \u2282 Uc(i,j) .\nThen, we apply the lemma 4.5 the paths t \u2208 [0, 1] 7\u2192 Hh(i/M, (j/N ) + (t/N ))\nand t \u2208 [0, 1] 7\u2192 Hh((i + 1)/M, (j/N ) + (t/N )) in Uc(i,j) for each i \u2208 {0, ..., M \u2212 1}\nand j \u2208 {0, ..., N \u2212 1}the following way:\n- We first apply it to t 7\u2192 Hh(0/M, (0/N ) + (t/N )) and t 7\u2192 Hh(1/M, (0/N ) +\n(t/N )), and then successively to each couple of path t 7\u2192 Hh(0/M, (j/N ) + (t/N ))\nand t 7\u2192 Hh(1/M, (j/N ) + (t/N )) for j = 1, ..., N \u2212 1 to have that there ex(0)\n(0)\nists g1 \u2208 G1 such that Hh(1/M, 1) = pa .g1 . We have also proved that, for\n(0,j)\nany j \u2208 {1, ..., N \u2212 1}, there exists g1\n\u2208 G1 such that Hh(1/M, (j/N )) =\n(0,j)\nHh(0/M, (j/N )).g1\n(i\u22121)\n\n\u2208 G1 such that Hh(i/M, 1) =\n- We assume that, for fixed i, there exists g1\n(i\u22121)\n(i\u22121,j)\npa .\u03c1(g1\n) and that for any j \u2208 {1, ..., N \u2212 1}, there exists g1\n\u2208 G1 such that\n(i\u22121,j)\nHh(i/M, (j/N )) = Hh(0/M, (j/N )).g1\n.\nThen, applying the same procedure as before, we consider each couple of path\nt 7\u2192 Hh(i/M, (j/N ) + (t/N )) and t 7\u2192 Hh((i + 1)/M, (j/N ) + (t/N )) for j =\n(0,j)\n0, ..., N \u2212 1, on which we apply Lemma 4.5. Then, there exists g1\n\u2208 G1 such that\n(i,j)\n(i)\nHh((i + 1)/M, (j/N )) = Hh(0/M, (j/N )).g1\nand g1 \u2208 G1 such that Hh((i +\n(i)\n1)/M, 1) = pa .g1 .\nWe have proved by induction that\n(M\u22121,N \u22121)\n\npb = Hh(1, 1) = H(0, 1).g1\n\n(M\u22121,N \u22121)\n\n= pa .g1\n\n.\n\n\u22121\n\nFrom Lemma 4.4, (i), we have also that the map z 7\u2192 \u03c1 \u25e6\u03c4a,b is smooth, remarking\nthat, for s < (N \u2212 1)/N , Hh(0, s) and Hh(1, s) do not depend on the choice of\nz.\n\u0003\nLet us now deal with the case where M is not simply connected.\nTheorem 4.6. Let G1 a Lie group with Lie algebra g1 , and a free representation\n\u03c11 : G1 \u2192 G. We assume that\n- for any smooth 1-parameter family Hct of horizontal paths starting at p, for any\nsmooth vector fields X, Y in T M ,\ns, t \u2208 [0, 1]2 \u2192 \u03a9ct (s) (X, Y )\nis a smooth g1 -valued map,\n- for any horizontal path H\u03b1 induced by a loop \u03b1 in P , there is g1 \u2208 G1 such that\nH\u03b1(1) = H\u03b1(0).\u03c11 (g1 ).\nThen, we can reduce the structure group of P to G1 .\nProof of the Theorem 4.6: The proof begins like the one of theorem 4.1,\nuntil we build the family of local trivializations \u03a8a , where a is a finite sequence of\n\n\f12\n\nJEAN-PIERRE MAGNOT\n\nelements of N such that a1 = 0. But here, the additional condition that we have,\nnamely, the holonomy of each horizontal path lies in \u03c11 (G1 ), gives us directely the\nresult.\n\u0003\nNote that, in these two theorems, the connection \u03b8 reduces to the reduced bundle\nwe have obtained. Let us now give the following lemma, which will be useful in\nwhat follows, if M is not simply connected.\nLemma 4.7. Let G1 be a connected regular Lie subgroup of G with Lie algebra\ng1 such that there is a connection \u03b8 with g1 -valued curvature. Assume that its Lie\nalgebra g1 is stable under the adjoint action of H curv . Then, there exists a regular\nLie group G\u20321 with connected component G1 for which the theorem of reduction 4.6\ncan be applied.\nProof of Lemma 4.7: As we already mentioned, if \u03a3M is the universal covering of\nM and P\u0303 (resp. \u03b8\u0303) is the pull back of P (resp. \u03b8) over \u03a3M , H0curv (\u03b8) = H curv (\u03b8\u0303).\nSince \u03a3M is simply connected, Theorem 4.1 applies to \u03b8\u0303, and as a consequence\nH0curv (\u03b8) = H curv (\u03b8\u0303) \u2282 G1 with continuous inclusion. Thus, in order to show\nthe Lemma, we show that it is possible to make a semi-direct product of G1 with\nH curv (\u03b8)/H0curv (\u03b8) with is a Lie subgroup of G. Recall that, since H curv /H0curv is\na group and we have a continuous surjection \u03c01 (M ) \u2192 H curv /H0curv , and hence\nH curv /H0curv is discrete. Let {ci } be a family of loops generating \u03c01 (M ), and\nlet gi be their holonomies. Let g \u2208 G1 , then, there exists a smooth path t \u2208\n[0, 1] 7\u2192 g(t) \u2208 G1 starting at the neutral element such that g = g(1). Let v(t) =\ng \u22121 (t)\u2202t g(t) \u2208 C \u221e ([0, 1], g1 ) its logarithmic derivative. gi .g.gi\u22121 is the endpoint of\nthe path t 7\u2192 gi .g(t).gi\u22121 , with logarithmic derivative t 7\u2192 Adgi .v(t).\n\u001b\n\u2200t \u2208 [0, 1], Adgi .v(t) \u2208 g1\n\u21d2 gi .g.gi\u22121 \u2208 G1\n\u0003\nG1\nis regular\n5. The restricted holonomy group\nThe holonomy group H0curv induced by horizontal paths is not actually an infinite\ndimensional Lie group, principaly because its structure is induced by the structure\nof the non associative monoid of the loops based at x. Howver, using the theorem\nof reduction of the previous chapter, the definition of the resricted holonomy group\nas a Lie group turns out to be very easy to give. For this, we pull back P over\nthe universal covering \u03a3M of M , which is simply connected. This gives a principal\nbundle P\u0303 , with structure group G and with basis \u03a3M , the universal covering of M ,\nwhere the connection \u03b8 can be pulled back into an unique connection \u03b8\u0303.\nDefinition 5.1. Given a category A of Lie groups. Let B be the set of objects in A\nsuch that, for each group H \u2208 B with Lie algebra h, there is an injective morphism\nof Lie groups \u03c1 : H \u2192 G such that the connection \u03b8 with curvature \u03a9 is such that:\nfor any smooth 1-parameter family Hct of horizontal paths starting at p, for any\nsmooth vector fields X, Y in T M ,\ns, t \u2208 [0, 1]2 \u2192 \u03a9ct (s) (X, Y )\nis a smooth h-valued map,\nif the set B has a minimal element for the inclusion H0red , we call it the restricted\nholonomy group of class A of \u03b8.\n\n\fSTRUCTURE GROUPS AND HOLONOMY IN INFINITE DIMENSIONS\n\n13\n\nTheorem 5.2. In these three contexts:\n1) G is CBH and A is the set of CBH Lie groups that are closed subgroups in G,\n2) G is of the first type and A is the set of Lie groups of the first type that are\nclosed subgroups in G,\n3) G is of the second type and A is the set of Lie groups of the second type that are\nclosed subgroups in G,\nwe can define the restricted holonomy group H0red of class A.Moreover, the Lie\nalgebra of H0red is the closed Lie algebra contained in g generated by the curvature\nelements.\nProof of the theorem 5.2: Since we work on the bundle P\u0303 that has a simply\nconnected basis, we can restrict ourselves to the Lie groups of the set B deduced\nfrom A that are connected. Then, using Theorem 1.5 and the lemma following, we\nhave that B has a minimal element, which is the connected Lie group with algebra\nspanned by the curvature elements.\nThe condition of closedness implies the enlargeability in these three cases. Then,\nsince the Lie algebra of H0red needs to contain all the curvature elements, the Lie\nalgebra which is given is clearly the smaller one.\n\u0003\n6. The holonomy group\nThe holonomy group H curv induced by horizontal paths is not actually an infinite\ndimensional Lie group, principaly because its structure is induced by the structure\nof the non associative monoid of the loops based at x. This is why we need to define\na Lie group H such that there is morphism of topological group H curv \u2192 H. H\nneeds to be the smaller as possible.\nDefinition 6.1. Let A be a category of Lie groups. We define the Holonomy group\nof class A as the minimal element of the set B\u2032 of objects H with Lie algebra h of\nA such that the connection \u03b8 with curvature \u03a9 is such that\n- for any smooth 1-parameter family Hct of horizontal paths starting at p, for any\nsmooth vector fields X, Y in T M ,\ns, t \u2208 [0, 1]2 \u2192 \u03a9ct (s) (X, Y )\nis a smooth h-valued map,\n- h is stable under the action of H curv .\nThen, if B\u2032 has a minimal element H red , we call it Holonomy group of class A of\nthe connection \u03b8.\nWith the conditions imposed to the groups of B\u2032 , one can recognize the conditions of Theorem 4.6 and of Lemma 4.7, and hence see that these conditions ensure\nthat \u03b8 reduces to the holonomy group if it is defined.\nTheorem 6.2. In these three contexts:\n1) G is CBH and A is the set of CBH Lie groups that are closed subgroups in G,\n2) G is of the first type and A is the set of Lie groups of the first type that are\nclosed subgroups in G,\n3) G is of the second type and A is the set of Lie groups of the second type that are\nclosed subgroups in G,\nwe can define the holonomy group H red of class A. Moreover, the Lie algebra of H\nis spanned by the curvature elements.\n\n\f14\n\nJEAN-PIERRE MAGNOT\n\nProof of the Theorem 6.2: According to Theorem 5.2 and Lemma 4.7, we have\nonly to show that the Lie algebra spanned by the curvature elements is stable by\nH curv . We already know that it is stable by H0curv . Let {ci } be a family of loops\ngenerating \u03c01 (M ), with holonomies {gi }. Let \u03a9(X, Y ) be a curvature element.\nThen, there exists a one parameter family of smooth loops ct based at x such that\nHc0 (1) = Hc0 (0) and if Hct (1) = Hct (0).gt , \u2202t=0 gt = \u03a9(X, Y ). Hence, if \u2217 is the\nmono\u00efd law of the loops based at x, we have that (ci \u2217 ct ) \u2217 c\u22121\nis a 0-homotopic\ni\nloop. Hence, its holonomy is in H0curv \u2282 H0red . Hence, taking the derivative with\n\u0003\nrespect to t, we have that Adgi (\u03a9(X, Y )) is in the Lie algebra of H0red .\n7. Final remarks: the holonomy group as an invariant of the\nconnection\nThe holonomy groups H red considered here are closed subgroups of the structure\ngroup G. That is, they depend on G as well as on \u03b8 and on the basis manifold M .\nIf we change the structure group G for another Lie group with weaker structure,\nwe also change the holonomy group.\nConceptually, the holonomy group should depend only on the choice of the connection \u03b8 and on the basis manifold M . It is the case for H curv , whose topology\nis the push-forward of the topology of the loops on M . One could expect to find\na wider class of Lie subgroups of G than the class of closed Lie subgroups that\nenables one to define H red with a stronger topology than the one of G. This leads\nto the following question:\nWhat is the weaker property (P ) on Lie subalgebras of g such that\n- if a totally ordered family B of subalgebras of g satisfy (P ), their intesection\n(equipped with the projective topology of the family B) also satisfies (P ),\n- if h1 and h2 satisties (P ), then h1 \u2229 h2 satisfies (P ),\n- if h satisfies (P ), there is a Lie subgroup H of G with Lie algebra h ?\nUnder these assumptions, one could apply Zorn's lemma to find the holonomy\ngroup H red of the considered connection with respect to the class of Lie groups\ndefined by (P ). The topology of this holonomy group should depend less on the\nchoice on the structure group G.\nMore generally, a natural question arises on H curv : when is it a Lie subgroup\nof G ? This question is the same as: when is H0curv a Lie subgroup of G ? This\nquestion is related to the actual loss of easy criteria to decide whether a topological\ngroup is a (regular ?) infinite dimensional Lie group. If H curv is a regular infinite\ndimensional Lie group modelled on a complete locally convex topological space, then\nthe theorem of reduction can be applied, and one can expect to find a category A\nof Lie groups for which H curv = H red . Otherwise, and especially if H curv is only\nan infinite dimensional Lie group (non regular) or only a topological group, the\ntheorem of reduction cannot be applied and one can expect to have H curv 6= H red .\nReferences\n[1] Ambrose, W.; Singer, I.M.; A theorem on holonomy Trans.
