On one hand, L\u00e9vy statisti s an emerge from the\nfra tal temporal nature of the underlying pro ess, i.e. a high variability in the rate\nof mi ros opi events. On the other hand, they may be a dire t onsequen e of the\ns ale-free spatial stru ture on whi h the pro ess evolves. Although both forms onsidered lead to Boltzmann equilibrium, the relaxation patterns are quite di\u001berent.\nAs an example, generalized di\u001busion in a double-well potential is onsidered.\n\n1 Introdu tion\nRandom walk pro esses leading to anomalous di\u001busion are adequate for des ribing various physi al situations. The\n\nontinuous time random walk (CTRW)\n\nmodel of S her and Montroll [1\u2104 for instan e, leading to strongly sub-di\u001busive\nbehavior, was a milestone in understanding photo ondu tivity in strongly disordered and glassy semi ondu tors. Due to its simpli ity, this model was reently employed to investigate aging phenomena typi al for glasses and related\n\nomplex systems [2,3,4,5\u2104. On the other hand, L\u00e9vy-\u001dight models [6\u2104,\n\nleading to superdi\u001busion, are adequate for the des ription of phenomena ranging from transport in heterogeneous\n\natalysis [7\u2104, self-di\u001busion in mi elle sys-\n\ntems [8\u2104, rea tions and transport in polymer systems under\n\nonformational\n\nmotion [9\u2104, transport pro esses in heterogeneous ro ks [10\u2104 and the behavior\nof dynami al systems [11\u2104 to \u001dight paths of albatrosses [12\u2104 and even human\n\n\u2217 Corresponding author\nEmail address: igor.sokolov\bphysik.hu-berlin.de (I.

L\u00e9vy-related statisti s were observed in hydrodynami\n\ntransport [15\u2104, and in the motion of gold nano lusters on graphite [16\u2104. In addition, mixed models were proposed in whi h slow temporal evolution (des ribed\nby S her-Montroll CTRW) is\n\nombined with the possibility of L\u00e9vy-jumps, so\n\nthat in general both sub- or superdi\u001busive behavior\n\nan arise [17,18\u2104. Similar-\n\nily, pro esses often referred to as L\u00e9vy-walks are based on long-tailed jumps in\nombinations with a time\n\nost to perform them, see for example [6,19\u2104. L\u00e9vy-\n\nwalks were introdu ed in [20\u2104 to explain a\njun tions and related\nTypi ally, the\n\nhaoti\n\nelerated di\u001busion in Josephson\n\nsystems [21\u2104.\n\norresponding pro esses are des ribed on a sto hasti\n\nthat the in orporation of boundary\nfor es leads to\n\nlevel, su h\n\nonditions, time- or position-dependent\n\nonsiderable mathemati al di\u001e ulties.\n\nCon erning ordinary di\u001busion and transport in a sto hasti system, the FokkerPlan k equation (FPE) is an adequate instrument for solving boundary value\nor time-dependent problems [22\u2104. The FPE is an equation for the probability\ndensity fun tion (pdf )\n\np(x, t)\n\nof the parti le's position at time\n\nt and\n\nreads\n\n\u2202p(x, t)\n= LF P p = \u2212\u2207 (\u03bcf (x, t)p(x, t)) + \u03ba\u2206p(x, t).\n\u2202t\nHere\n\nLF P\n\ndenotes the Fokker-Plan k operator,\n\nthe di\u001busion\n\noe\u001e ient (assumed to be\n\n\u03bc\n\nand\n\n(1)\n\n\u03ba are the mobility and\nf (x, t) is the external\n\nonstant) and\n\nfor e a ting on the parti le. Note that sin e the mobility and the di\u001busion\noe\u001e ient are\ntion e\u001be tively\n\nonne ted via the Einstein relation,\n\n\u03ba = kT \u03bc \u2261 \u03bc/\u03b2 ,\n\nthe equa-\n\nontains only one free parameter. Alternatively, eq. (1) may be\n\nre ast into a di\u001berent form in the\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\u2202\n\u2202p(x, t)\n= \u03ba \uf8f0e\u2212\u03b2\u03a6/2\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n\nase of a potential for e\n\n!2\n\ne\u03b2\u03a6/2 p \u2212 p e\u03b2\u03a6/2\n\nthe equivalen e of whi h to eq. (1) is easily\n\nf (x, t) = \u2212\u2207\u03a6(x, t):\n\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n\n!2\n\n\uf8f9\n\ne\u2212\u03b2\u03a6/2 \uf8fb ,\n\n(2)\n\nhe ked by expanding the di\u001ber-\n\nentiations. Obviously, the stationary solution of the FPE (if it exists) is the\nBoltzmann distribution,\n\np(x) \u221d exp(\u2212\u03b2\u03a6). Inserting this form into eq. (2) one\n\nreadily infers that the two terms entering with opposite signs are equal and\nan el.\nIn order to investigate analogous systems in orporating anomalous di\u001busion,\nvarious generalizations of the FPE were proposed. Con erning subdi\u001busion\nthe appropriate generalizations\n\nan be obtained from CTRW models, for a\n\ngeneral survey see [27\u2104, as well as from an approa h based on fra tional master\nequations [28\u2104. Con erning superdi\u001busion (L\u00e9vy-\u001dights), su h generalizations\ntypi ally involve\n\nhanging from a gradient and Lapla ian to the\n\nfra tional derivative. For example, a pure L\u00e9vy-\u001dight\n\n2\n\norresponding\n\nan be des ribed by\n\n\fmeans of the fra tional di\u001busion equation [23,24,25\u2104\n\n\u2202p(x, t)\n= \u03ba\u03b1 \u2206\u03b1/2 p(x, t),\n\u2202t\n\u2206\u03b1/2 is a\nfun tion f (x) in\n\u2212 |k|\u03b1 f (k). The\n\nwhere\n\n(3)\n\nfra tional Lapla ian, a linear operator, whose a tion on a\n\u03b1/2\n2 \u03b1/2\n\nFourier spa e is des ribed by\n\n\u2206\n\nf (x) = \u2212 (k )\n\nf (k) =\n\noordinate representation of this operator is dis ussed in Ap-\n\npendix 1. The solution of eq.

[26\u2104). On the other hand, there\n\nway to generalize the Fokker-Plan k operator\n\nontaining an ex-\n\nternal for e term: For example, the drift term may stay un hanged, may\nrespond to a symmetri\n\nor asymmetri\n\nor-\n\nfra tional derivative, or the whole\n\nFokker-Plan k-operator may be raised to the power of\n\n\u03b1/2.\n\nAll\n\norrespond-\n\ning equations have their physi al meaning and appli ations. The properties\nof their solutions di\u001ber\n\nonsiderably. Moreover, as we pro eed to show, other\n\ngeneralizations are also possible. The situation here is to some extent similar to one in fra tal geometry: What is the generalization of the Eu lidean\ndimension to the fra tal\nerty of interest it\n\nase? Depending on the system and on the prop-\n\nould be the fra tal dimension, the spe tral dimension, or\n\neven a spe trum of di\u001berent dimensions. In what follows we dis uss the properties of some generalization of the FPE to the superdi\u001busive\nto L\u00e9vy-\u001dights in the for e-free limit. We will fo us on two\n\nase leading\n\nomplementary\n\nsituations, namely one in whi h superdi\u001busion stems from fra tal temporal\nproperties of the underlying mi ros opi\n\ndynami s and another in whi h the\n\nspatial stru ture is responsible for enhan ed di\u001busion. We mostly\n\non entrate\n\non the generalizations of the forms, eq. (1) and eq. (2) whi h lead to a Boltzmann distribution in equilibrium. We dis uss the physi al impli ations of the\norresponding equations and some properties of their solutions. As a physi ally\nmost interesting appli ation, a fra tional generalization of a Kramers problem\nin a double-well potential is\nwhi h\n\nan be\n\nonsidered. Let us \u001crst turn to the situations\n\nonsidered as stemming from the fra tal temporal behavior.\n\n2 L\u00e9vy pro esses as stemming from subordination\nAn important property of symmetri\n\nL\u00e9vy pro esses is the fa t that they\n\nare subordinated to ordinary Brownian motion: the\n\n3\n\norresponding pdf\n\nan be\n\n\frepresented in the form:\n\np(x, t) =\n\n1\nt1/\u03b1\n\nL\n\n\u0012\n\nx\nt1/\u03b1\n\n\u0013\n\n; \u03b1, 0 =\n\nZ\u221e\n0\n\n1\nx2\n\u221a\nexp \u2212\n2\u03c4\n2\u03c0\u03c4\n\n!\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03b1\nL 2/\u03b1 ; , 1 d\u03c4\n2/\u03b1\nt\nt\n2\n\u03c4\n\n(6)\nwhere\n\nL (x; \u03b1/2, 1) is an extreme (one-sided) L\u00e9vy distribution of index \u03b1/2 [26\u2104.\n\nThe variable\n\n\u03c4\n\nis\n\nalled the operational time of the pro ess. The interpretation\n\nof eq. (6) is that Levy-\u001dights\n\nan be\n\nonsidered as stemming from a highly\n\nirregular sampling traje tories generated by simple di\u001busion (random walk).\nThis type of temporal behavior plays a very important role in many situations\nen ountered in physi s, su h as anequilibrium phase transitions [29\u2104. For a\nreview see [30\u2104 and referen es therein.\nHere, the traje tory of di\u001busion (a random walk in a dis rete\n\nase or a Wiener\n\npath in a ontinuous situation) is parameterized by the operational time\n\n\u03c4\n\n(say,\n\nthe number of steps of the random walk), whi h itself is a random fun tion\nof the (physi al) time.
