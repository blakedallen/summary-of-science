INTRODUCTION\n\nThe QHD effective field model represents a very succesfull attempt to describe, in a fully consistent\nrelativistic picture, equilibrium and dynamical properties of nuclear systems at the hadronic level [1\u20133]. Very\nnice results have been obtained for the nuclear structure of finite nuclei [4\u20136], for the N M Equation of State\nand liquid-gas phase transitions [7] and for the dynamics of nuclear collisions [8,9]. Relativistic RandomPhase-Approximation (RRP A) theories have been developed to study the nuclear collective response [10\u201315].\nIn this paper we present a relativistic linear response theory with the aim of a trasparent connection\nbetween the collective dynamics and the coupling to various channels of the nucleon-nucleon interaction. In\nparticular we will focus our attention on the dynamical response of asymmetric nuclear matter since one of\nthe main points of our discussion is the relevance of the coupling to a scalar isovector channel, the virtual\n\u03b4[a0 (980)] meson, not considered in the usual dynamical studies. Another point of interest is the dynamical\ntreatment of the Fock terms, neglected in the usual Relativistic Mean Field (RM F ) scheme of the papers\ncited before.\nA relativistic extension of the Landau linear response theory of Fermi Liquids has been considered before\njust starting from the relativistic form of the Landau parameters [16\u201318]. We will show that the full dispersion\nrelations obtained from the relativistic kinetic equations present some interesting corrections that cannot be\nneglected.\nThe main physics results are:\n\u2022 The important effect of a \u03b4-meson coupling on the isovector collective mode at saturation baryon\ndensity. This is of interest for the relativistic study of the Giant Dipole Resonance in heavy finite\nnuclei. It is important to note that the inclusion of Fock terms is acting in the same direction.\n\u2022 The presence of noticeable \"chemical effects\" in the propagating collective oscillations, i.e. the charge\nsymmetry of the \"waves\" is quite different from the asymmetry of the initial equilibrium matter. The\neffect is opposite for the unstable modes present at low densities, more proton rich and leading to the\nisospin distillation effect, and for the stable propagating sounds at high baryon density which appear\nmostly like \"pure neutron waves\".\n\n1\n\n\f\u2022 A stimulating \"mirror\" structure of the isoscalar and isovector linear response, with the restoring forces\ngiven by the potential part respectively of the compressibility and the symmetry energy. The interplay\nbetween the scalar and vector meson effective fields in the dynamics is very similar for the two degrees\nof freedom, as already observed for static properties [19]. The conclusion is that a consistent relativistic\neffective field model has to include on the same footing isoscalar and isovector meson fields, both scalar\nand vector.\nOur results around normal density can be used as general guidelines in predicting the behaviour of volume\ncollective modes in finite \u03b2\u2013unstable nuclei. Similar study for asymmetric N M have been performed in\nRef. [20] using Skyrme\u2013like interactions. Apart the difference in the used interactions, in particular for the\nsymmetry terms, we will see similar results and interesting new relativistic effects.\nIn Sect.II we derive the kinetic equations in the general case of non-linear self-interacting terms, including\nthe Fock corrections. We discuss the inclusion of the \u03b4-meson channel, also on the model parameters. In\nSect.III we present the relativistic linear response equations. In Sect.IV we have a general discussion on the\nformal structure of the dispersion relations, the role played by the scalar/vector mesons and the comparison\nto non-relativistic cases. Results for isovector(-like) collective modes are presented in Sect.V, in particular for\nthe asymmetry and baryon density effects. The isoscalar(-like) response is analysed in Sect. VI. Conclusions\nand outlooks can be found in Sect.VII.\nII. KINETIC EQUATIONS FROM A QHD EFFECTIVE THEORY\n\nWe start from the QHD effective field picture of the hadronic phase of nuclear matter [1\u20133]. In order to\ninclude the main dynamical degrees of freedom of the system we will consider the nucleons coupled to the\nisoscalar scalar \u03c3 and vector \u03c9 mesons and to the isovector scalar \u03b4 and vector \u03c1 mesons.\nThe Lagrangian density for this model, including non\u2013linear isoscalar/scalar \u03c3-terms [21], is given by:\nL = \u03c8\u0304[\u03b3\u03bc (i\u2202 \u03bc \u2212 g\u03c9 V \u03bc \u2212 g\u03c1 B \u03bc * \u03c4 ) \u2212 (M \u2212 g\u03c3 \u03c6 \u2212 g\u03b4 \u03c4 * \u03b4 )]\u03c8 +\n1\na\nb\n1\n1\n(\u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202 \u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 m2s \u03c62 ) \u2212 \u03c63 \u2212 \u03c64 \u2212 W\u03bc\u03bd W \u03bc\u03bd + m2v V\u03bd V \u03bd +\n2\n3\n4\n4\n2\n1\n1\n1\n\u03bc\n2 2\n\u03bc\u03bd\n(\u2202\u03bc \u03b4 * \u2202 \u03b4 \u2212 m\u03b4 \u03b4 ) \u2212 G\u03bc\u03bd * G + m2\u03c1 B\u03bd * B \u03bd\n2\n4\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere W \u03bc\u03bd (x) = \u2202 \u03bc V \u03bd (x) \u2212 \u2202 \u03bd V \u03bc (x) and G\u03bc\u03bd (x) = \u2202 \u03bc B \u03bd (x) \u2212 \u2202 \u03bd B \u03bc (x) .\nHere \u03c8(x) is the nucleon fermionic field, \u03c6(x) and V \u03bd (x) represent neutral scalar and vector boson fields,\nrespectively. \u03b4 (x) and B \u03bd (x) are the charged scalar and vector fields and \u03c4 denotes the isospin matrices .\nFrom the Lagrangian Eq.(1) with the Euler procedure a set of coupled equations of motion for the meson\nand nucleon fields can be derived. The basic approximation in nuclear matter applications consists in\nneglecting all the terms containing derivatives of the meson fields, with respect to the mass contributions.\nThen the meson fields are simply connected to the operators of the nucleon scalar and current densities by\nthe following equations:\nb \u03c3 + A\u03a6\nb 2 + B\u03a6\nb 3 = \u03c8\u0304(x)\u03c8(x) \u2261 \u03c1c\n\u03a6/f\nS\nb \u03bc (x) = f\u03c9 \u03c8\u0304(x)\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8(x) \u2261 f\u03c9b\nj\u03bc ,\nV\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nb\nB (x)\n= f\u03c1 \u03c8\u0304(x)\u03b3 \u03c4 \u03c8(x) ,\nb\n\u03b4 (x)\n\n= f\u03b4 \u03c8\u0304(x)\u03c4\u03c4 \u03c8(x)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nb = g\u03c3 \u03c6, f\u03c3 = (g\u03c3 /m\u03c3 )2 , A = a/g\u03c33 , B = b/g\u03c34 , f\u03c9 = (g\u03c9 /m\u03c9 )2 , f\u03c1 = (g\u03c1 /2m\u03c1 )2 , f\u03b4 = (g\u03b4 /m\u03b4 )2 .\nwhere \u03a6\nFor the nucleon fields we get a Dirac-like equation. Indeed after substituting Eqs.(2,3) for the meson\nfield operators, we obtain an equation which contains only nucleon field operators. All the equations can be\nconsistently solved in a Mean Field Approximation (RM F ), where most applications have been performed,\nin particular in the Hartree scheme [3,5].\nThe inclusion of Fock terms is conceptually important [22,23] since it automatically leads to contributions\nto various channels, also in absence of explicit coupling terms. We will discuss this point later. A thorough\nstudy of the Fock contributions in a QHD approach with non-linear self-interacting terms has been recently\nperformed [24], in particular for asymmetric matter [25].\nThe present approximation implies that retardation and finite range effects in the exchange of mesons\nbetween nucleons are neglected. Nevertheless, thanks to the small Compton wave\u2013lengths of the mesons \u03c3,\n2\n\n\f\u03c9,\u03c1 and \u03b4, the assumptions expressed by Eqs. (2,3) are quite reasonable. For light mesons such as pions this\napproximation is not justified. However in this case a perturbative expansion in the pion-nucleon coupling\nconstant seems to be reasonable [22]. Moreover it has been shown that the inclusion of pions does not change\nqualitatively the description of nuclear matter around normal conditions [22].\nWe remark that the kinetic approach discussed here is fully consistent with the previous approximation. We\nare concerned with a semiclassical description of nuclear dynamics, so that the nuclear medium is supposed\nto be in states for which the nucleon scalar and current densities are smooth functions of the space-time\ncoordinates.\nWithin a mean field picture of the QHD model we focus our analysis on a description of the many-body\nnuclear system in terms of one\u2013body dynamics. This is enough for the scope of the paper. Correlation effects\ncan be effectively included at the level of coupling constants, as noted in the discussion of the results.\nWe will perform the many-body calculations in the quantum phase-space introducing the Wigner transform\nof the one-body density matrix for the fermion field [26,27].\nThe one\u2013particle Wigner function is defined as:\nZ\n1\nR\nR\n[Fb(x, p)]\u03b1\u03b2 =\nd4 Re\u2212ip*R h: \u03c8\u0304\u03b2 (x + )\u03c8\u03b1 (x \u2212 ) :i ,\n(2\u03c0)4\n2\n2\n\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are double indices for spin and isospin. The brackets denote statistical averaging and the\ncolons denote normal ordering. The Wigner function is a matrix in spin and isospin spaces; in the case of\nasymmetric NM it is useful to decompose it into neutron and proton components. Following the treatment\nof the Fock terms in non-linear QHD introduced in Ref. [24,25], we obtain for the Wigner function the\nfollowing kinetic equation:\ni\n\u2202\u03bc \u03b3 \u03bc F\u0302 (i) (x, p) + \u03b3 \u03bc p\u2217\u03bci F\u0302 (i) (x, p) \u2212 Mi\u2217 F\u0302 (i) (x, p) +\n2\ni\ni h \u0303\n\u2206 f\u03c9 j\u03bc (x)\u03b3 \u03bc \u00b1 f \u0303\u03c1 j3\u03bc (x)\u03b3 \u03bc \u2212 f \u0303\u03c3 \u03c1S (x) \u2213 f \u0303\u03b4 \u03c1S3 (x) F\u0302 (i) (x, p) = 0,\ni = n, p\n(4)\n2\nwhere \u2206 = \u2202x * \u2202p , with \u2202x acting only on the first term of the products.

We remind that we are dealing with a transport equation so\nthe currents and densities, in general, are varying functions of the space\u2013time, at variance with the case of\nnuclear matter at equilibrium.\nThe expression of Eq.(5) for the effective mass, embodies an isospin contribution from Fock terms also\nwithout a direct inclusion of the \u03b4 meson in the Lagrangian. The usual RM F approximation (Hartree level)\nis covered by the Hartree-Fock results, one has has only to change the coupling functions f \u0303i (i = \u03c3, \u03c9, \u03c1, \u03b4),\nEqs.(6), with the coupling constants fi .\nEquilibrium properties: the nuclear Equation of State\n\nIn the following we will study the collective modes. In order to analyze the results it is essential to relate\nthem to the equation of state (EOS), that we will briefly discuss in the following. In particular for the\ncollective modes in asymmetric nuclear matter it is important the behaviour of the symmetry energy Esym .\n3\n\n\fThe energy density and pressure for symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter and the n, p effective\ng2\nmasses can be self-consistently calculated just in terms of the four boson coupling constants, fi \u2261 ( mi2 ),\ni\n\ni = \u03c3, \u03c9, \u03c1, \u03b4, and the two parameters of the \u03c3 self-interacting terms, A \u2261 ga3 and B \u2261 gb4 , see ref.

[19]).\n4\n\n\fThen in the density range of interest here we can use, at the leading order, a much simpler form of the\nsymmetry energy, with transparent \u03b4-meson effects:\n\"\n\u0012 \u2217 \u00132 #\nM\n1 kF2\n1\n\u03c1B\n(11)\nEsym (\u03c1B ) =\nf\u03c1 \u2212 f\u03b4\n+\n6 EF\u2217\n2\nEF\u2217\nWe see that, when the \u03b4 is included, the observed a4 value actually assigns the combination [f\u03c1 \u2212 f\u03b4 ( EMF )2 ]\nof the (\u03c1, \u03b4) coupling constants. If f\u03b4 6= 0 we have to increase the \u03c1-coupling (see Fig.1 of ref. [29]). In our\ncalculations we use the value a4 = 32M eV .\nIn Table I the Set I corresponds to f\u03b4 = 0. In the Set II f\u03b4 is chosen as 2.0f m2. Although this value is\nrelatively well justified, [19], we stress that aim of this work is just to show the main qualitative new dynamical\neffects of the \u03b4-meson coupling. In order to have the same a4 we must increase the \u03c1-coupling constant of a\nfactor three, up to f\u03c1 = 2.8f m2 . Now the symmetry energy at saturation density is actually built from the\nbalance of scalar (attractive) and vector (repulsive) contributions, with the scalar channel becoming weaker\nwith increasing baryon density [19]. This is indeed the isovector counterpart of the saturation mechanism\noccurring in the isoscalar channel for the symmetric nuclear matter. From such a scheme we get a further\nstrong fundamental support for the introduction of the \u03b4-coupling in the symmetry energy evaluation.\n\nFIG. 1. Total (kinetic+potential) symmetry energy as a function of the baryon density. Long dashed: Hartree\n(N LH + \u03c1). Dotted: Hartree (N LH + \u03c1 + \u03b4). Solid: Hartree-Fock (N LHF ).\n\nFIG. 2. Baryon density variation of the isovector effective coupling when the Fock terms are included.\n\nDetails of the calculation can be found in Refs. [25,19], here we show only the result corresponding to the\nparametrizations (Sets I, II and N LHF ) that we will use to investigate the dynamical response. In Fig.1\nwe report the symmetry energy as a function of the baryon density in the Hartree case (\u03c1 and \u03c1 + \u03b4) and with\nthe Fock terms [(\u03c1 + \u03b4) case]. When the \u03b4 \"channel\" is included the behaviour is stiffer for the relativistic\nmechanism discussed before, see also ref. [19].\nWhen the Fock terms are evaluated the new \"effective\" couplings Eqs.(6) naturally acquire a density\ndependence. This is shown in Fig.2 for the isovector terms. The decrease of the \"effective\" \u03c1 coupling at\n5\n\n\fhigh density accounts for the slight softening of the symmetry energy seen in Fig.1 (from the dotted to the\nsolid line).\nIII. LINEAR RESPONSE EQUATIONS\n\nIn this section we study collective oscillations that propagate in cold nuclear matter due to the mean field\ndynamics. In some sense we follow a relativistic extension of the method introduced by Landau to study\nliquid-3 He [30\u201332] and recently applied to investigate stable and unstable modes in nuclear matter [20,33,34].\nThe starting point is the kinetic transport equation Eq.(4). We look for solutions corresponding to small\noscillations of F\u0302 (x, p) around the equilibrium value. Therefore we put\nF\u0302 (x, p) = \u0124(p) + \u011c(x, p)\n\n(12)\n\nb\nb p) represent its fluctuations.\nwhere H(p)\nis the Wigner function at equilibrium (see Appendix) and G(x,\nFor the equilibrium state the Wigner function contains only the isoscalar term and the third component\nof the isovector term. We limit ourselves to study excited states in these channels. Therefore we consider\nisovector density fluctuations with mT = 0 only, i.e. we do not study processes where a neutron converts into\na proton or viceversa.

In particular in our case the coupling functions to the scalar-isoscalar channel depend on all\nthe isoscalar and isovector densities and currents (for details, see [24]), then it is even more general.\nThe set of equations developed in the Hartree-Fock approximation recover the ones correponding to the\nusual Hartree approximation (RM F ).

We expect to have some extra\ncontributions in the various interaction channels without qualitative modifications of the physical response.\nThe normal collective modes are plane waves, characterized by the wave vector (k \u03bc = (k 0 , 0, 0, | k |)), they\nare determined by solving the set of homogeneous Eqs.(19,20). The solutions correspond only to longitudinal\nwaves and do not depend on k 0 and |k| separetly, but only on the ratio\n\nvs =\n\nk0\n.\n|k|\n\nThe sound velocities are given by values of vs for which the relevant determinant of the set (Eqs.(17, 18))\nvanishes, i.e. the dispersion relations. In correspondence the neutron/proton structure of the eingenvectors\n(normal modes) can be derived. It should be remarked that in asymmetric nuclear matter isoscalar and\nisovector components are mixed in the normal modes. Here this can be argued by the fact that in each of\nthe Eqs. (19, 20) both proton/neutron densities and currents are appearing.\nHowever we remind that one can still identify isovector-like excitations as the modes where neutrons and\nprotons move out of phase, while isoscalar-like modes are characterized by neutrons and protons moving in\nphase [20,37].\n7\n\n\fIV. THE ROLE OF SCALAR/VECTOR FIELDS IN THE DYNAMICAL RESPONSE\n\nBefore showing numerical results for the dynamical response of asymmetric nuclear matter, in various\nbaryon density regions and using the different effective interactions, we would like to analyse in detail the\nstructure of the relativistic linear response theory in order to clearly pin down the role of each meson coupling.\nIsovector Response\n\nOne may expect that once a4 is fixed, the velocity of sound is also fixed [16]. On the other hand our results\nclearly indicate a different dynamical response with or without the \u03b4-meson channel, for interactions which\ngive exactly the same a4 parameter, see Figs.(3, 4) in the following. In order to get a clear understanding of\nthis effect we will consider the case of symmetric nuclear matter in the Hartree scheme, where the dispersion\nrelations are assuming a transparent analytical form.\n(i)\n(i)\nFor symmetric N M the densities, the effective masses and the coefficients C (i) (k), C\u03bb (k) and C\u03bb\u03bc (k) are\nequal for protons and neutrons. Now it is also possible to decouple the collective modes into pure isoscalar\nand isovector oscillations, [20]. After a straightforward rearragement of Eqs. (19), (20), we have for the\nisovector modes:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03c1S\nC00 (k)\n2\n\u03b4\u03c13 +\n\u2212\n8\n(1\n\u2212\nv\n)\nf\u03c1 \u03b4\u03c13 \u2212 8 f\u03b4 C0 (k) \u03b4\u03c1S3 = 0\ns\nM\u2217\nM\u2217\nh\u03c1\ni\nS\n\u03b4\u03c1S3 +\n\u2212\n8\nC(k)\nf\u03b4 \u03b4\u03c1S3 + 8 f\u03c1 C0 (k) (1 \u2212 vs2 ) \u03b4\u03c13 = 0 .\n(21)\nM\u2217\n\nWe stress that the structure is the same for the isoscalar excitations, of course one has to change the isovector\nfluctuations with the isoscalar ones (\u03b4\u03c1B , \u03b4\u03c1S ), and the coupling constants of isovector mesons with those\nof the isoscalar mesons [36].\nNote that in this case to find the zero\u2013sound velocity one has to evaluate determinant of a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\n(and not a 4 \u00d7 4), hence the condition for having a solution can be written as\n\u0014\n\u0011\u0015\n\u03c1S\nM \u22172 \u0010\n(22)\n1 + NF f\u03c1 (1 \u2212 vs2 ) \u2212 f\u03b4 \u22172 1 \u2212 f\u03b4 A(kF , M \u2217 ) \u2212 f\u03c1 \u2217 vs2 \u03c6(s) = 0\nEF\nM\n2K E \u2217\n\nhere NF = \u03c0F2 F is the density of states at the Fermi surface and s \u2261 vs /vF . To get Eq.(22) we have\nused the expression for C(k), C0 (k) and C00 (k) in terms of the Lindhard function \u03c6(s) (see Appendix). The\nquantity A(KF , M \u2217 ) is the same integral discussed in Eqs.(9,10,11).\nAt this point we can make the following approximation\nvs2 \u2243 vF2 =\n\nkF2\n,\nEF\u22172\n\nto evaluate the expression inside the square brackets. Looking at Fig.s (3,4,7) this is a good approximation\nwithin a 3%. The Eq.(22) asssumes a quite clear form:\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0015\nM\u2217\nf\u03c1 kF2\n6 E\u2217\npot\n(23)\n\u2212\n1\n\u2212\nf\n\u03c1\n1 + 2F Esym\n\u03b4\nS \u03c1B \u03c6(s) = 0 .\nkF\n2 EF\u22172\nEF\u22172\nwhere the potential part of the symmetry energy explicitly appears in the dispersion relations, but joined to\npot\nan important correction term which shows a different f\u03c1 , f\u03b4 structure with respect to that of Esym\n, Eqs.(9,\n11). We can easily have interactions with the same a4 value at normal density but with very different isovector\nresponse. E.g. when we include the \u03b4 channel we know that we have to increase the f\u03c1 coupling in order\nto have the same a4 , see the discussion of the Eqs.(9, 11), but now the \"restoring force\" (coefficient of the\nLindhard function in the Eq.(23)) will be strongly reduced.\nEquation (23) suggests to define an effective symmetry energy like\n\u0012\n\u0013\nM\u2217\nf\u03c1 kF2\n\u2217\npot\n1 \u2212 f\u03b4 \u03c1S \u22172 \u03c1B .\n(24)\nEsym = Esym \u2212\n2 EF\u22172\nEF\nwhich acts as a restoring force for the isovector mode. We can see that once the symmetry energy is fixed its\neffect on the dynamical response depend on the strength of each isovector field. In particular we can easily\n8\n\n\fverify that the f\u03b4 factor inside bracket in Eq.(24) is a second order correction and the \"leading contribution\"\n\u2217\npot\n\u2217\nto the reduction \u2206Esym\n= Esym\n\u2212 Esym\nis essentially given by the coupling of the \u03c1-meson field. On the\nother hand we know [25] that once the symmetry energy at saturation density a4 is fixed, the change of\nf\u03c1 only due to the strenght of f\u03b4 . We have seen from Table I that f\u03c1 can go from 1 f m2 , if we switch off\nthe \u03b4-channel, to f\u03c1 = 2.8 f m2 . In terms of the effective symmetry energy this means (if we consider the\n\u2217\ndynamical response at \u03c10 ), \u2206Esym\n\u223c 4 M eV if f\u03b4 \u223c 2.0 f m2 . This \"softening\" of the restoring force easly\naccounts for the decrease of the sound velocity (vs /vF n seen in Fig.3) for symmetric nuclear matter, \u03b1 = 0,\nwhen we pass from N LH \u2212 \u03c1 and N LH \u2212 (\u03c1 + \u03b4).\nIsoscalar Response\n\nAs already remarked, we like to note that for symmetric N M there is a tight analogy between the isoscalar\nand the isovector response in the RM F approach. In the isoscalar degree of freedom the compressibility will\nplay the same role of the symmetry energy in the dispersion relation equations. Also in this case we will\nhave an important correction term coming from the interplay of the scalar and vector channel.\nThe Eq.(22) now becomes [36]:\n\u0014\n\u0015\nM \u22172 \u0010\n\u03c1S 2 \u0011\n2\n\u2217\n1 + NF f\u03c9 (1 \u2212 vs ) \u2212 f\u03c3 \u22172 1 \u2212 f\u03c3 A(kF , M ) \u2212 f\u03c9 \u2217 vs \u03c6(s) = 0\n(25)\nEF\nM\nthat can be reduced to the isoscalar equivalent of the Eq.(23):\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0015\nkF2\nM\u2217\nEF\u2217\npot\nKN M \u2212 9 f\u03c9 \u22172 1 \u2212 f\u03c3 \u22172 \u03c1S \u03c1B \u03c6(s) = 0 .\n1+\n3 kF2\nEF\nEF\n\n(26)\n\npot\nwhere the KN\nM is the potential part of the nuclear matter compressibility that in the Hartree scheme has\nthe simple structure [36](see also Eq.(16) of ref. [16])\n\"\n\u0012 \u2217 \u00132 #\n3 kF2\nM\npot\nkin\nKN M (\u03c1B ) = \u2217 + 9 f\u03c9 \u2212 f\u03c3\n\u03c1B \u2261 K N\n(27)\nM + KN M ,\nEF\nEF\u2217\n\nBy means of such an analogy, the previous discussion can be extended to isoscalar oscillations with the role\nof Esym now \"played\" by the compressibility. In this case however one always takes into account both the\nscalar and vector channel in any RM F models. However the coupling costant f\u03c9 can assume very different\nvalues depending on the required value for effective masses M0\u2217 . This is easy to understand since in the\nRM F limit the saturation binding energy has the simple form\nE/A(0) = EF\u2217 + f\u03c9 \u03c1B (0) \u2212 MN\nwhere MN is the bare nucleon mass. So we see that the same saturation values of \u03c1B , E/A when decrease\nM0\u2217 we have to increase f\u03c9 . Just to get an idea, we mention that among the most common used RM F\nparametrizations, f\u03c9 can go from 3.6 f m2 of N L2 [8] to 10.2 f m2 of N L3 [12], just decreasing the effective\nmass at saturation from 0.82MN to 0.6MN . In some sense this is obvious because if two EOS have different\neffective masses even if the compressibility is equal the dynamical behaviour is expected to be different. This\nis a very general feature present also in non-relativistic approaches.\nFrom studies on monopole resonances in finite nuclei with RM F it seems that a higher value of compressibility is required respect to non-relativistic calculations. Many authors state that this certainly demands\nfor a clarification [13,14]. Even if the monopole resonance is not directly connected to the isoscalar collective\nmode in nuclear matter, our discussion nicely suggests to look at the interplay between effective mass and\ncompressibility. For example we can estimate by means of Eq.(26)that we can have a shift between the compressibility and the \"effective compressibility\" of the order of \u223c 100 M eV among different parametrization\nwith the same KN M . Therefore model with K \u223c 300 AM eV can reproduce the same frequencies of other\nmodels with K \u223c 200 AM eV (and a slightly larger M0\u2217 ).\nLandau Parameters\n\nWe would like to briefly discuss the relativistic equations for collective modes in terms of the Landau\nparameters. Interesting features will appear from the comparison to the non-relativistic analogous case. We\n9\n\n\fwill focus first on the isovector response, but, as already clearly shown before, the structure of the results\nwill be absolutely similar in the isocalar channel.\nThe general non\u2013relativistic expression for the isovector modes can be found in Ref. [31]:\n\u0014\n\u0015\nF1a\n2\n1 + F0a +\n\u03c6(s) = 0\n(28)\ns\n1 + 1/3 F1a\nwhere F0a is the \"isovector\" combination of the Landau F0 parameters for neutrons and protons F0a =\nFann \u2212 F0np , that can be expressed in terms of density variations of the chemical potentials:\nF0qq\u2032 \u2261\n\nkF q EF\u2217 q\n\u2202\u03bcq\nNq \u2212 \u03b4qq\u2032 , Nq \u2261\n, q = n, p\n\u2202\u03c1q\u2032\n\u03c02\n\n(29)\n\nF1a are the equivalent for the momentum dependent part of the mean field. In the relativistic approach, for\nsymmetric nuclear matter, we get:\nF0a = F\u03c1 \u2212 F\u03b4\nF1a = \u2212F\u03c1\n\nM \u22172\n1\nEF\u22172 1 + f\u03b4 A(kF , M \u2217 )\n\nvF2\n,\n1 + 13 F\u03c1 vF2\n\n(30)\n\nwhere Fi = NF fi (i = \u03c1, \u03b4) with NF = 2Nn,p . Note that the F1a contribution comes only from the vector\npot\ncoupling. By using the expression Esym\nEq.(9), we can write Eq.(28) in the same form of Eqs.(22, 23). The\nresult is a similar expression but with the lack of the term in f\u03b4 inside the brackets in Eq.(23). As said, this\nis not the leading term, however around saturation density it amounts to about a 10% of the total correction.\nMoreover turning to the analogy with isoscalar channel the coupling of the \u03c3 field is now much larger and\nthis purely relativistic contribution could be up to a 20%. We underline this point because generally the\nlinear response in RM F is discussed calculating the Landau parameters and then using these estimations\ndirectly into the non\u2013relativistic expression for collective modes [16,18].\nIn conclusion from the analysis in terms of the Landau parameters, we can describe the effect of the\nscalar-vector coupling competition previuosly discussed in the following way. The symmetry energy fixes the\nF0a , in fact:\nEsym =\n\nkF2\n(1 + F0a )\n6 EF\u2217\n\n(31)\n\nbut in the dynamical response enters also the F1a , linked to the momentum dependence of the mean field,\nmostly given by the vector meson coupling. The results are completly analogous in the isoscalar channel,\nwith the compressibility given by\nKN M =\n\n3 kF2\n(1 + F0s )\nEF\u2217\n\n(32)\n\nwith \"isoscalar\" combination F0s = F0nn + F0np . The relativistic forms of the isoscalar Landau parameters\nare exactly the same as in Eq.(30), just substituting the \u03b4, \u03c1 coupling constants with the \u03c3, \u03c9 ones [36].\nV. ISOVECTOR COLLECTIVE MODES IN ASYMMETRIC NUCLEAR MATTER\n\nIn this section we discuss results for the isovector collective oscillations which are driven by the symmetry\nenergy terms of the nuclear EOS. The aim is mainly to investigate the effect of the scalar-isovector channel.\nThis is normally not included in studying the isovector modes and in general the properties of symmetric\nmatter in a relativistic approach, while it should be naturally present on the basis of the analysis shown in\nthe previous section (and in ref. [19] for equilibrium properties). Moreover we stress again that Hartree-Fock\nscheme embodies in any case the presence of a scalar-isovector channel, even without the inclusion of the\n\u03b4-meson field [25].\nWe will first show results obtained in the Hartree scheme (N LH) including either both the isovector \u03c1\nand \u03b4 mesons or only the \u03c1 meson. Even if the Hartree approximation has a simpler structure, it contains\nall the physical effects we want to point out. Finally from the complete Hartree-Fock (N LHF ) calculations\nwe will confirm the dynamical contribution of the scalar isovector channel.\n10\n\n\fFor N LH calculations we use the parametrizations of Table I, Set I (\u03c1) and Set II (\u03c1 + \u03b4). In the HartreeFock case the coupling constant f\u03b4 is adjusted to the value f \u0303\u03b4 (\u03c10 ) = 2.0f m2 of the N LHF model Eq.(6).\nWe note that this value is smaller that the prediction of recent Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock calculations\n[38], therefore the effects due to the \u03b4-channel presented in the following could be even underestimated in\nthe N LHF case.\nHartree Results\n\nLet us start by considering isovector-like excitations. In Fig.3a we show the sound velocities in the Hartree\napproximation, as a function of the asymmetry parameter \u03b1 for different baryon densities. We actually plot\nthe sound velocities in units of the neutron Fermi velocities. This is physically convenient: when the ratio is\napproaching 1.00 we can expect that this \"zero\" sound will not propagate due to the strong coupling to the\n\"chaotic\" single particle motions (\"Landau damping\"). This quantity then will also directly give a measure\nof the \"robustness\" of the collective mode we are considering.\nDotted lines refer to calculations including (\u03c1 + \u03b4) mesons, long-dashed lines correspond to the case with\nonly the \u03c1 meson. Calculations are performed at \u03c1B = \u03c10 and \u03c1B = 2 \u03c10 . We stress that the results of\nthe two calculations differ already at zero asymmetry, \u03b1 = 0. At normal density (\u03c10 curves), in spite of the\nfact that the symmetry energy coefficient, a4 = Esym (\u03c10 ), is exactly the same in the two cases, significant\ndifferences are observed in the response of the system. From Fig.3(a) we can expect a reduction of the\nfrequency for the bulk isovector dipole mode in stable nuclei when the scalar isovector channel (\u03b4 \u2212 like)\nis present. Moreover we note that, in the N LH \u2212 \u03c1 case, the exicitation of isovector modes persists up to\nhigher asymmetries at saturation density.\n\nFIG. 3. Isovector-like modes: (a) Ratio of zero sound velocities to the neutron Fermi velocity VF n as a function of\nthe asymmetry parameter \u03b1 for two values of baryon density. Long dashed line:N LH \u2212 \u03c1; Dotted line:N LH \u2212 (\u03b4 + \u03c1).\n(b) Corresponding ratios of proton and neutron amplitudes. All lines are labelled with the baryon density,\n\u03c10 = 0.16f m\u22123 . The full circles in panel (b) represent the trivial behaviour of \u2212(\u03c1p /\u03c1n ) vs. \u03b1.\n\nThese are non-trivial features, related to the different way scalar and vector fields are entering in the\ndynamical response of the nuclear system. Such behaviours are therefore present in both collective responses,\nisoscalar and isovector. We have devoted the whole previous section (Sec.IV) to a complete discussion of\nthis effect.\nDifferences are observed even at \u03c1B = 2\u03c10 , where however also the symmetry energy is different. A larger\nEsym is obtained in the case including the \u03b4 meson (see Fig.1) and this leads to a compensentation of the\neffect observed at normal nuclear density. In particular, at higher asymmetries \u03b1 the collective exicitation\nbecomes more robust for N LH \u2212 (\u03c1 + \u03b4). Differences are observed also in the \"chemical\" structure of the\nmode, represented by the ratio \u03b4\u03c1p /\u03b4\u03c1n , plotted in Fig.3(b). The ratio of the out of phase n, p oscillations\nis not following the ratio of the n, p densities for a fixed asymmetry, given by the full circles in the figure.\nWe systematically see a larger amplitude of the neutron oscillations. The effect is more pronouced when the\n\u03b4 (scalar-isovector) channel is present (dotted lines).\n\n11\n\n\fHartree-Fock Results\n\nWe have also performed the calculation in the more general case of the Hartree-Fock approximation,\nN LHF , whose formalism has been presented before, Eqs.(17, 18). We have fitted the same properties of\nsymmetric N M at the saturation density as for Hartree case, N LH. In particular at \u03c10 the value of the\nisovector coupling is fixed in order get the same symmetry energy (the a4 parameter) of the N LH \u2212 (\u03c1 + \u03b4)\ncase.\n\nFIG. 4. The same as Fig.3 but for N LHF (solid lines) and N LH \u2212 (\u03b4 + \u03c1) (dotted lines).\n\nIn Fig.4 we can see that quite similar results are obtained in Hartree-Fock calculations, with respect to\nthe Hartree results including \u03c1 and \u03b4 mesons, especially at the normal density. This can be understood by\nconsidering that in Hartree-Fock calculation the effective density dependent couplings associated with the\nisovector channels are tuned in such a way to roughly reproduce, at normal density, the values of the coupling\nconstants f\u03c1 and f\u03b4 of the Hartree scheme: then not only a4 is the same but also its internal structure. Since\nsuch a tuning can be done only at a given density value, some differences are observed at \u03c1B = 2 \u03c10 , due\nto the density dependence of the effective coupling constants of the N LHF scheme. Therefore the greater\nvalue of sound velocity in the Hartree case can be linked to the greater value of Esym , see Fig.1.\nDisappearance of the Isovector Modes\n\nFor asymmetric matter we have found that, in all the calculation schemes, with increasing baryon density\nthe isovector modes disappear: we call such densities \u03c1cross\n. E.g. from Figs.3(b),4(b) we see that the ratio\nB\n\u03b4\u03c1p /\u03b4\u03c1n tends very quickly to zero with increasing baryon density, almost for all asymmetries. Around this\ntransition density we expect to have an almost pure neutron wave propagation of the sound. Here we show\nthe results of the N LH + \u03c1 case, see Figs.5 and 6, but the effect is clearly present in all the models.\nFor symmetric matter we have a real crossing of the two phase velocities, isoscalar and isovector, as shown\nthe isoscalar mode is the most robust.\nin Fig.5(a). Above \u03c1cross\nB\n\n12\n\n\fFIG. 5. Sound phase velocities of the propagating collective mode vs. the baryon density (N LH + \u03c1 case). Crosses:\nisovector-like. Open circles: isoscalar-like.

Ratio of protons and neutron amplitudes in the propagating mode, for different asymmetries, as a function\nof the baryon density around the \u03c1cross\n. Crosses: \u03b1 = 0.1, Fig.5b. Open circles: \u03b1 = 0.5, Fig.5c.\nB\n\nFor asymmetric matter we observe a transition in the structure of the propagating normal mode, from\nisovector-like to isoscalar-like, Fig.5(b,c). Similar effects have been seen in a non-relativistic picture [20].\nFor a given asymmetry \u03b1 the value of \u03c1cross\nis different for the three models considered, as can be argued\nB\nby the behaviour of \u03b4\u03c1p /\u03b4\u03c1n at 2\u03c10 in Figs.3(b), 4(b). E.g. for \u03b1 = 0.1 N LHF has the lower value\n(\u03c1cross\n\u2243 2.4\u03c10 ), while N LH \u2212 \u03c1 has the higher one (\u03c1cross\n\u2243 3.0\u03c10 ). This is again related to the reduction\nB\nB\nof the isovector restoring force when the scalar-isovector channel (\u03b4-like) is present, see Sec.IV.\nFrom Fig.6 we see that the proton component of the propagating sound is quite small in a relatively wide\nregion around the \"transition\" baryon density, a feature becoming more relevant with increasing asymmetry,\nsee the open circle line. This is quite interesting since it could open the possibility of an experimental\nobservation of the neutron wave effect.\nVI. ISOSCALAR COLLECTIVE MODES IN ASYMMETRIC NUCLEAR MATTER\n\nSo far we have focussed our discussion on the isovector-like response of the asymmetric nuclear matter.\nHowever it is well known that in asymmetric nuclear matter can exist also isoscalar-like modes, see [20,37]\nand ref.s therein.\nExotic High Baryon density modes\n\nFrom the previous analysis we have seen the isoscalar-like excitations to become dominant at high baryon\ndensity, above the \u03c1cross\nintroduced before.\nB\n13\n\n\fSome results are shown in Fig.7. It should be noticed that the frequency of the isoscalar-like modes is\nessentially related to the compressibility of the system at the considered density. In Fig.7(a) we display\nthe sound velocity obtained in Hartree and Hartree-Fock calculations at \u03c1B = 3.5 \u03c10 , as a function of the\nasymmetry \u03b1. The differences observed among calculations performed within the Hartree or Hartree-Fock\nscheme are due to a different behaviour of the associated equation of state at high density.\n\nFIG. 7. The same of Fig.3 for isoscalar-like modes, at \u03c1B = 3.5\u03c10 . Solid line: N LHF . Long Dashed line: N LH \u2212\u03c1.\nDotted line: N LH \u2212 (\u03c1 + \u03b4). The full circles in panel (b) represent the behaviour of \u03c1p /\u03c1n vs. \u03b1.\n\nAt \u03b1 = 0 the two Hartree models have exactly the same isoscalar mean fields, but for asymmetric nuclear matter the different behaviour of the symmetry energy leads to a different compressibility. The case\nN LH \u2212 (\u03c1 + \u03b4) which has the stiffer Esym (resulting in a greater incompressibility for \u03b1 > 0) with respect\nto N LH \u2212 (\u03c1) shows also a greater increase of vs /vF n with density. Instead, N LHF even if it has the\nsame compressibility KN M at saturation density, shows a different vs . This should be due to the density\ndependence of the coupling function arising from exchange terms which leads to different values of KN M out\nof \u03c10 (even for \u03b1 = 0).\nSome differences are observed also in the chemical composition of the mode (Fig.7(b)). The black spots\nshow the behaviour of \u03c1p /\u03c1n vs. \u03b1. Note the pure neutron wave structure of the propagating sound, since\nthe oscillations of protons appear strongly damped (\u03b4\u03c1p /\u03b4\u03c1n \u226a \u03c1p /\u03c1n ); unfortunately this is an effect not\nexperimentally accessible (at present), see also the discussion at the end of the previous Section.\nBefore closing this discussion we have to remark that the isoscalar-like modes at high baryon density are\nvanishing if the nuclear EOS becomes softer. This is indeed the results of two recent models, ref.s [18,39],\nwhere the nuclear compressibility is decreasing at high baryon density for a reduction of the isoscalar vector\nchannel contribution. In [18] this is due to self-interacting high order terms for the \u03c9 meson, while in ref.\n[39] to a reduced f\u03c9 coupling with increasing baryon density.\nFinally we note that all causality violation problems (superluminal sound velocities) observed in the non\nrelativistic results at high baryon density, see [16] and Fig.3c in ref. [20], are completely absent in the\nrelativistic approach, see the high density trends in Fig.5.\nIsospin Distillation in Dilute Matter\n\nWe have also investigated the response of the system in the region of spinodal instability associated with\nthe liquid\u2013gas phase transition, which occurs at low densities. It is known that in this region an isoscalar\nunstable mode can be found, with immaginary sound velocity, that gives rise to an exponential growth of the\nfluctuations. The latter can represent a dynamical mechanism for the multi\u2013fragmentation process observed\nin heavy\u2013ion collisions. We have found this kind of solution in the present approach. In Fig.8 we show the\nratio \u03b4\u03c1p /\u03b4\u03c1n as function of the initial asymmetry for such a collective mode. For all the interactions this\nratio is different from the corresponding \u03c1p /\u03c1n of the initial asymmetry \u03b1. This is exactly the chemical effect\nassociated with the new instabilities in dilute asymmetric matter [7,37].\n\n14\n\n\fFIG. 8. Isocalar\u2013like unstable modes at \u03c1B = 0.4 \u03c10 : Imaginary sound velocity (a) and ratio of proton and neutron\namplitudes (b) as a function of the asymmetry \u03b1. Solid line: N LHF ; Dotted line: N LH \u2212 (\u03c1 + \u03b4); Long Dashed\nline: N LH \u2212 \u03c1.The full circles in panel (b) represent the behaviour of \u03b4\u03c1p /\u03b4\u03c1n vs. \u03b1.\n\nIn particular it is found that, when isoscalar-like modes become unstable, the ratio \u03b4\u03c1p /\u03b4\u03c1n becomes\nlarger that the ratio \u03c1p /\u03c1n (at variance with the stable modes at high densities, see Fig.7). Hence proton\noscillations are relatively larger than neutron oscillations leading to a more symmetric liquid phase and to a\nmore neutron rich gas phase, during the disassembly of the system. This is the so\u2013called isospin distillation\neffect in fragmentation, and signatures of this effect could be searched by looking at the ratio N/Z of\nfragments produced in dissipative heavy ion collisions [40,41].\nWe note here that in dilute asymmetric N M we can distinguish two regions of instability, mechanical\n(cluster formation) and chemical (component separation). There is however no discontinuity in the structure\nof the unstable modes which are developing. For all realistic effective nuclear interactions (relativistic and\nnon) the nature of the unstable normal modes at low densities is always isoscalar-like, i.e. with neutrons\nand protons oscillating in phase, although with a distillation effect discussed before, see ref. [37] for a fully\ndetailed study of this important property of asymmetric nuclear matter.\nIn Fig.8 we observe that Hartree results (with and the without \u03b4 meson) are very similar and, indeed, at low\ndensity the symmetry energy behaviour is nearly the same in the two cases. On the other hand, differences\nare observed with respect to the Hartree-Fock case. In fact, the N LHF symmetry energy presents a softer\nbehaviour (around \u03c1B = 0.4\u03c10 ), that leads to a smaller distillation effect. We remark that the equality\nbetween N LH with and without \u03b4 is in agreement with the analysis in terms of the generalized Landau\nparameters associated to normal modes developed in Ref. [19]. We can conclude that there are essentially\nno effects of the scalar isovector channel on isospin distillation in the spinodal decomposition.\nVII. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK\n\nWe have developed a linear response theory starting from a relativistic kinetic equations deduced within a\nQuantum-Hadro-Dynamics effective field picture of the hadronic phase of nuclear matter. In the asymmetric\ncase we consider as the main dynamical degrees of freedom the nucleon fields coupled to the isoscalar, scalar\n\u03c3 and \u03c9, and to the isovector, scalar \u03b4 and vector \u03c1, mesons.\nUsing the Landau procedure we derive the dispersion relations which give the sound phase velocity and the\ninternal structure of the normal collective modes, stable and unstable. We have focussed our attention on\nthe effect of the isovector mesons on the collective response of asymmetric (neutron-rich) matter. In order\nto better understand the dynamical role of the different mesons, the results are obtained in the Hartree\napproximation, which has a simpler and more trasparent form. The contribution of Fock terms is also\ndiscussed.\nWe have singled out some qualitative new effects of the \u03b4-meson-like channel on the dynamical response\nof AN M . Essentially, our investigation indicates that even if the symmetry energy is fixed, the dynamical\nresponse is affected by its internal structure, i.e. the presence or not of an isovector-scalar field. This is\nimplemented by the explicit introduction of an effective \u03b4-meson and/or by the Fock term contributions.\n\n15\n\n\fThe interest comes from the fact that both mechanisms are absent in the usual relativistic RP A calculations\nfor finite nuclei.\nIt is important to stress that the same interplay between scalar (\u03c3-meson) and vector (\u03c9-meson) contributions can be seen in the dynamical isoscalar response. In general we clearly show a close analogy in the\nstructure of the linear response equations:\n\u2022 Same form of the dispersion relations, cfr. Eq.(22) and Eq.(25).\npot\npot\nand KN\n\u2022 Parallel role of Esym\nM in the determination of the restoring force, Eqs.(23) and (27).\n\n\u2022 Parallel structure of the corrections due to the scalar-vector meson competition, Eqs.(23) and (27).\nThis appears to be a beautiful \"mirror\" structure of the relativistic approach that strongly support the\nintroduction of a \u03b4-meson-like coupling in the isovector channel. We like to remind that the same \"mirror\"\nstructure of the relativistic picture has been recently stressed in ref. [19] for equilibrium properties, saturation\nbinding and symmetry energy, the a1 and a4 parameters of the Weiszaecker mass formula.\nThe relativistic dispersion relations have been compared with the non-relativistic ones of the Landau\nFermi Liquid theory expressed in terms of Landau parameters evaluated in a relativistic scheme [18]. The\ncorrections appear to be not negligible, particularly for the isoscalar response.\nFrom the numerical results on the collective response of AN M some general features are qualitatively\npresent in all the effective interactions in the isovector channel:\n\u2022 In asymmetric matter we have a mixing of pure isoscalar and pure isovector oscillations which leads to\nchemical effect on the structure of the propagating collective mode: the ratio of the neutron/proton\ndensity oscillations \u03b4\u03c1n /\u03b4\u03c1p is different from the initial \u03c1n /\u03c1p of the matter at equilibrium. However\nwe can still classify the nature of the excited collective motions as isoscalar \u2212 like (when neutron and\nprotons are oscillating in phase) and isovector \u2212 like (out of phase). To note that similar effects can\nbe obtained also using non-relativistic effective forces [20,37].\n\u2022 For a given asymmetry the isovector-like mode is the most robust at low baryon density, always showing\na larger neutron component in the oscillations. With increasing baryon density we observe a smooth\ntransition, at a \u03c1cross\n\u2243 2 \u2212 3\u03c10, to an isoscalar-like branch, still with a dominant \u03b4\u03c1n . In the region of\nB\nthe transition we predict a propagation of almost pure neutron waves. For relatively large asymmetries\nN \u2212Z\ncross\n(\u03b1 \u2261 N\n. All\n+Z = 0.5, N = 3Z) this behaviour is present in a wide interval of densities around \u03c1B\nthat seems to suggest the possibility of an experimental observation of related effects in intermediate\nenergy heavy ion collisions with exotic beams. If the compressibility of nuclear matter is decreasing at\nhigh baryon density also these exotic isoscalar-like mode will disappear. This could be a nice signature\nof the softening of nuclear EOS at high densities.\n\u2022 The isoscalar-like motions become unstable at sub-saturation densities still with a strong chemical\neffect, now in the opposite direction with respect to the one discussed before, present in the stable high\ndensity modes. Now the unstable oscillation is more proton-rich, eventually leading to the formation\nof more symmetric clusters vs. a very neutron-rich gas phase. This is the neutron distillation effect\n[7,20,34,37,40,41], a new important feature of the liquid-gas phase transition in asymmetric nuclear\nsystems.\nA.
