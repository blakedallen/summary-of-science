The main question here is: How many different\nplacements are possible? A similar problem concerning placements of the\nResearch financed by EC's IHRP Programme, within the Research Training Network\n\"Algebraic Combinatorics in Europe\", grant HPRN-CT-2001-00272\n\u2217\n\n1\n\n\fmaximum number of nonattacking kings on a 2m \u00d7 2n chessboard is treated\nin [W]. The main result of that paper is the following theorem.\nTheorem 1. Let fm (n) denote the number of ways that mn nonattacking\nkings can be placed on a 2m \u00d7 2n chessboard. For each m = 1, 2, 3, . . . there\nare constants cm > 0, dm , and 0 \u2264 \u03b8m < m + 1 such that\nn\nfm (n) = (cm n + dm )(m + 1)n + O(\u03b8m\n)\n\n(n \u2192 \u221e).\n\nGiven an m \u00d7 n chessboard. We mark a square containing a pawn by 1,\nand a square that does not contain a pawn by 0. The placement of pawns is\nthen completely specified by an m \u00d7 n binary matrix. Moreover, to be a legal\nplacement, the binary matrix cannot contain the following two letter words:\n1\n1\n(here we use the fact that all pawns are of the same colour and\n1\n1 and\nthus they are allowed to attack at the same directions: either at North-West\nand North-East or at South-West and South-East). For example, the matrix\n1 0 1 1 0 1\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 1 1\ncorresponds to a legal placement of pawns on a 3 \u00d7 6 board. So, our main\nquestion can be reformulated as follows: How many binary m \u00d7 n matrices\n1\n1\nsimultaneously avoid the words 1 and 1 ? We denote the number of such\nmatrices by Mm,n .\nStudying matrices avoiding certain words, and thus studying our original problem, is interesting, for instance, from a graph theoretic point of\nview [CW]. In that paper, the authors considered the (vertex) independence\nnumber of the m \u00d7 n grid graph using the matrices with the property that\nno two consecutive 1's occur in a row or a column.\nIn this paper, we use the transfer-matrix approach to implement an algorithm that allows us to find a formula for Mm,n for any given m (see Sections 3\nand 4). Moreover, in Section 2 we find an upper bound for Mm,n and, in Section 3, we discuss how the tiling problem is related to finding a lower bound\nfor Mm,n . Also, we prove that the double\nlimit limm,n\u2192\u221e (Mm,n )1/mn exists\n\u221a\nand is bounded from above by (1 + 5)/2 (see Sections 4 and 2). Finally,\nin Section 5, we suggest an approach to study Mm,n , which, in particular,\nallows to prove that M2m,n is a perfect square (see Theorem 7). Using this\napproach we obtain formulas for Mm,n , where 2 \u2264 m \u2264 6.\n2\n\n\f2\n\nThe upper bound for Mm,n\n\nTo obtain an upper bound for Mm,n , we determine the number Um,n of binary\n1\nm \u00d7 n matrices that avoid the word 1 . Of course, Um,n counts also the\n1\n\nnumber of binary m\u00d7n matrices that avoid the word 1 , which follows from\narranging the columns of all matrices under consideration in reverse order\n1\n1\n(in particular, 1 is the reverse of 1 ).\nThe following theorem gives a formula for the number of binary matrices\n1\nthat avoid the word 1 in terms of the Fibonacci numbers.\nTheorem 2. For any n, m \u2265 0,\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nn\u2212m+1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 Fm+1\n\uf8f2\nUm,n =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nm\u2212n+1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 Fn+1\n\nm\nY\n\nFi\n\ni=0\n\nn\nY\ni=0\n\nFi\n\n!2\n\n!2\n\n,\n\nif n \u2265 m,\n\n,\n\nif n < m,\n\nwhere Fi is the i-th Fibonacci number defined by F0 = F1 = 1, and Fn+2 =\nFn+1 + Fn for n \u2265 0.\n1\n\nProof. Let A be an m \u00d7 n (0,1)-matrix that avoids the word 1 . We change\nthe shape of A using the following procedure. We shift the first column of A\none position down with respect to the second column. In the obtained shape,\nwe shift the first and second columns one position down with respect to the\nthird column, and so on. After shifting with respect to the n-th column, one\nobtains the shape \u0100, that has the form similar to that on Figure 1.\n\nm=4\nn\n\nFigure 1: The shape \u0100 for m = 4.\n\n3\n\n\fIt is easy to see that A avoids the word\n\n1\n1\n\nif and only if \u0100 avoids the\n\nword 1 1 . But \u0100 avoids 1 1 if and only if each row of \u0100 avoids 1 1 (there\nare no additional restrictions). This is well known and is not difficult to see\nthat the number of different binary strings of length l that avoid 1 1 is given\nby Fl+2 .\nTo find Um,n , it remains to find out the lengths of the rows in \u0100, and\nsince these rows are independent from each other, to multiply together the\ncorresponding Fibonacci numbers. If n \u2265 m, \u0100 has two rows of each of the\nfollowing lengths: 1, 2, . . . , m \u2212 1, and n \u2212 m + 1 rows of length m. So, in\nthis case\n!2\nm\nY\nn\u2212m+1\nUm,n = Fm+1\nFi .\ni=0\n\nThe case n < m is given by changing m by n, and n by m in the considerations\nabove.\n\nLet A be any binary matrix, we say that A avoids the k-diagonal word\n(see Figure 2) if there are no k consecutive 1's in any diagonal of A. Theorem 2 can be generalized to the case of avoiding the k-diagonal word. This\ngeneralization involves the k-generalized Fibonacci numbers. We do not use\nthe generalization to proceed with the problem of the pawns, but we state it\nas Theorem 3 because it is interesting by its own.\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\nFigure 2: The k-diagonal word.\n\nLet Fk,n be the n-th k-generalized Fibonacci number defined by Fk,n = 0\nfor n < 0, Fk,0 = 1, and Fk,n = Fk,n\u22121 + Fk,n\u22122 + * * * + Fk,n\u2212k for n \u2265 1 (for\nexample, see [F, SP]).\nLet Um,n (k) denote the number of m \u00d7 n binary matrices that avoid\nthe k-diagonal word. The following theorem can be proved using the same\narguments as those in Theorem 2 and the observation that the number of\n4\n\n\fdifferent binary strings of length l that avoid the word |11 {z\n. . . 1} is given by\nk\n\nFk,l+1 (we leave this observation as an exercise).\n\nTheorem 3.

Indeed,\n1\nMm,n \u2264 Um,n since Um,n deals with avoidance of 1 , whereas Mm,n deals\nadditionaly with one more restriction, namely\nthe following theorem.\n\n1\n\n1\n\n.

Clearly, Lm,n \u2264 Mm,n , since when\nwe deal with Lm,n we have more restrictions than when we consider Mm,n .\n6\n\n\fThus, we are interested in finding the numbers Lm,n , that give us a lower\nbound for Mm,n . In this section we show that Lm,n , in fact, gives the number\nof tilings of an (m + 1) \u00d7 (n + 1) area with square tiles of size 1 \u00d7 1 and 2 \u00d7 2\nwhich was studied in [H] and [CH]. So, the number of the tilings is equal to\n1\n1\n1\nthe number of m \u00d7 n binary matrices that avoid the words 1 , 1 , 1 and\n\n. A bijection \u03b8 between these two combinatorial objects is given by the\nfollowing.\n1\n1\n1\nLet A be an m \u00d7 n matrix that avoids the words 1 , 1 , 1 and 1 1 .\nWe make from A an (m + 1) \u00d7 (n + 1) matrix \u0100 by adjoin an additional m \u00d7 1\ncolumn consisting of 0's from the right side, and an additional 1 \u00d7 (n + 1)\nrow, also having only 0's, from below. Now, once we meet an occurrence of\n1 in \u0100, we place a 2 \u00d7 2 tile in such way, that the 1 appears in the top-left\ncorner of the tile. After considering all 1's and placing corresponding 2 \u00d7 2\ntiles, we fill in the uncovered squares of \u0100 by 1 \u00d7 1 tiles. The fact that A\n1\n1\n1\navoids 1 , 1 , 1 and 1 1 guarantees that covering in the way proposed\nby us is non-overlapping, and thus we get a tiling of an (m + 1) \u00d7 (n + 1)\nboard.\nConversely, for any given tiling with square tiles of size 1 \u00d7 1 and 2 \u00d7 2,\nwe can place 1 in the top-left corner of any 2 \u00d7 2 tile, 0's in the other squares,\nand remove the rightmost column and the bottom row. Obviously, we get\n1\n1\n1\nan m \u00d7 n binary matrix that avoids the words 1 , 1 , 1 and 1 1 .\nFigure 3 shows how the bijection \u03b8 works in the case of a 4 \u00d7 5 matrix.\n1 1\n\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\u03b8\n\n1\n\n1\n\nFigure 3: The bijection \u03b8.\n\n7\n\n1\n\n\fUnfortunately, we cannot get much use of the papers [H] and [CH], since\nthere, for our purpose, one has explicit formulas only for m = 2, 3, and for\nm = 4, 5 one has recursive formulas only. That means that from that source,\nwe have an information about Lm,n , where 1 \u2264 m \u2264 4.\nRemark 1. If we use the transfer-matrix approach (see [M, pawns-kings])\nfor finding the formula for Lm,n , where m is given, then we get the following:\nL1,n = Fn+1 , L2,n = 31 (2n+2 \u2212 (\u22121)n ), and\n\u0011n\n\u0011n\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nL3,n = a 32 + 2 313 cos \u03b2 + b 23 \u2212 2 339 sin \u03b2 \u2212 2 313 cos \u03b2\n\u0010\n\u0011n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n+c 23 + 2 339 sin \u03b2 \u2212 2 313 cos \u03b2 ,\n\n\u221a \u0001\nwhere \u03b2 = 13 arctan 83 237 , a \u2248 1.51212496094, b \u2248 \u22120.542960193686, and\nc \u2248 0.0308352327442.\n\n4\n\nThe transfer-matrix method\n\nWe use the transfer-matrix method, in a manner that is similar to way it was\nused in [W].\nFor m, n fixed, we can think of constructing the m \u00d7 n binary matrices\n1\n1\navoiding the words 1 and 1 by gluing together columns that are chosen\nfrom the collection of possible columns, making sure that when we glue an\nadditional column onto the right-hand edge of the structure, the new column does not come into conflict with the previous right-hand column. The\ncollection of possible columns Cm is the set of all m-vectors v of 0's and 1's.\nClearly, |Cm | = 2m .\nThe condition that vectors v, w in Cm are possible consecutive pair of\n1\n1\ncolumns in a matrix avoiding 1 and 1 is simply that vi wi+1 = 0 and\nvi+1 wi = 0 for all i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m \u2212 1. We say that such v and w are crossorthogonal.\nThus, all possible matrices under consideration are obtained by beginning\nwith some vector of Cm , and in general, having arrived at some sequence of\nvectors of Cm , adjoin any vector of Cm that is cross-orthogonal to the last\none previously chosen until n vectors have been selected.\nWe define a matrix T = Tm , the transfer matrix of the problem, as follows.\nT is an 2m \u00d7 2m symmetric matrix of 0's and 1's whose rows and columns\n8\n\n\fare indexed by vectors of Cm . The entry of T in position (v, w) is 1 if the\nvectors v, w are cross-orthogonal, and 0 otherwise. T depends only on m,\nnot on n.\nLet Mm,n (u) denote the number of m \u00d7 n binary matrices avoiding the\n1\n1\nwords 1 and 1 whose rightmost column vector is u. Then, clearly, we have\nMm,n+1 (v) =\n\nX\n\nMm,n (u)Tu,v\n\nu\u2208Cm\n\n(n \u2265 0; v \u2208 Cm ),\n\nor, in matrix-vector notation, Mn+1 = T Mn , with M0 = 1 the vector of\nlength 2m whose entries are all 1's. It follows that Mn = T n * 1, for all n \u2265 0.\nThe number of matrices Mm,n is the sum of the entries of the vector Mn .\nThus, if 1\u2032 denote the row of length 2m whose entries are all 1's, we have\nMm,n = 1\u2032 * T n * 1,\ni.e., Mm,n is the sum of all of the entries of the matrix T n .\nExample 1.

It follows that\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nlim inf (\u03b1m ) m = lim inf (Mm,n ) mn \u2264 lim sup(Mm,n ) mn = lim sup(\u03b1m ) m . (3)\nm\n\nm,n\n\nm,n\n\n1\n\nTheorem 6.

We implemented an algorithm for finding\nthe transfer-matrix Tm in Maple (see [M, pawns]). This algorithm yields an\nexplicit formula for Mm,n , where 1 \u2264 m \u2264 3 (see Table 1).

In particular,\nwe obtain formulas for Mm,n , where 2 \u2264 m \u2264 6 (the cases m = 2, 3 already\nappear in Table 1). We show how to use the following simple observation in\norder to investigate Mm,n .\nObservation 1. A pawn placed on a square of a chessboard cannot attack a\nsquare of the different colour.\nAccording to Observation 1, Mm,n = Bm,n *Wm,n , where Bm,n (resp. Wm,n )\nis the number of ways to place nonattacking pawns on the black (resp. white)\nsquares of an m \u00d7 n chessboard. Thus, the original problem of finding Mm,n\ncan be reduced to considering independently two shapes: that consisting of\nall the black squares, and the shape consisting of all the white squares. We\nuse this idea in the proofs of the following theorem and propositions.\nTheorem 7. We have that M2m,n = a2 for some natural number a, that is\nM2m,n is a perfect square.\nProof. Using the discussion right above this theorem, it is enough to prove\nthat B2m,n = W2m,n . Indeed, on a 2m \u00d7 n chessboard, the number of black\nsquares is the same as that of white squares. Moreover, if we consider the\n11\n\n\fshape that, say, the white squares form, reverse it horizontally (that is, draw\nthe rows in reverse order), then we get exactly the same shape that the black\nsquares form. Also, it is easy to see that a placement of pawns before the\nreversion is legal if and only if it is legal after the reversion. Thus, we have\nB2m,n = W2m,n .\nProposition 1. We have\nM2,n = (Fn+2 )2 ,\nwhere Fn is the n-th Fibonacci number defined by F0 = F1 = 1, and Fn+2 =\nFn+1 + Fn for n \u2265 0.\nProof. Let us draw the black squares of a 2 \u00d7 n chessboard in one 1 \u00d7 n\nrow, in the order we meet these squares in the chessboard by going from left\nto right. Obviously, we have a legal placement of pawns on the chessboard\nif and only if we have no two consecutive pawns in the row, or in terms of\nmatrices and word avoidance, the row avoids the word 1 1 . The number\nof different legal rows is given by the (n + 2)-nd Fibonacci number, that is\nB2,n = Fn+2 .\n\nFigure 4: Finding M2,5 .\n\nIndependently, we can make the same considerations with the white\nsquares on the chessboard to get W2,n = Fn+2 . Thus, M2,n = (Fn+2 )2 . For\ninstance, Figure 4 shows that for finding M2,5 one can consider two rows of\nlength 5.\nProposition 2. For all n \u2265 0, M3,2n+1 = (4tn \u2212 3tn\u22121 )(2tn \u2212 3tn\u22121 ) and\nM3,2n = t2n , where\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u221a !n+1\n\u221a !n+1\n5 \u2212 13\n5 + 13\n1\n\uf8f8.\n\u2212\ntn = \u221a \uf8ed\n2\n2\n13\n12\n\n\fProof. Let an (resp. bn ) denote the number of legal placements of pawns in\nthe first (resp. second) shape on Figure 5 defined by black squares (there are\nn columns in each shape). According to Observation 1, one has M3,n = an bn .\nLet us find an and bn .\n\n...\n\n...\n\nbn\n\nan\n\nFigure 5: The shapes under consideration.\n\nWe consider the first shape. There are two black squares in the first\ncolumn. Depending on whether or not these squares have pawns, we have\nfour possibilities. As before, we use 1 for a square having a pawn, and 0\notherwise. Thus, the first column of the shape is either 00, or 01, or 10, or 11\nwhen reading from top to bottom. In the first case, the first column of the\nshape does not affect the rest of the shape, and therefore can be removed. So,\nin the first case the number of placements of pawns is bn\u22121 . In the second,\nthird and fouth cases, the black square in the second column must contain\nno pawn, that is 0, in order to have a legal placement. This 0 does not affect\nwhat follows to the right of it, and thus two first columns of the shape can\nbe removed. So, the second, third and fouth cases give 3an\u22122 placements\nof pawns. Thus, an = 3an\u22122 + bn\u22121 . Similarly, one can consider the second\nshape to get bn = an\u22121 + bn\u22122 . Solving the equations for an and bn , we have\na2n = tn , a2n+1 = 4tn \u2212 3tn\u22121 , b2n = tn , and b2n+1 = 2tn \u2212 3tn\u22121 .\nThis gives the desired result.\nRemark 3. If a(x) and b(x) denote the generating functions for the numbers\nan and bn respectively in the proof of Proposition 2, then\na(x) =\n\n1 + 4x \u2212 3x3\n1 + 2x \u2212 3x3\nand\nb(x)\n=\n.\n1 \u2212 5x2 + 3x4\n1 \u2212 5x2 + 3x4\n13\n\n\fProposition 3. We have that M4,n = \u03b1n2 , where the generating function for\nthe numbers \u03b1n is given by\n1 + 2x \u2212 2x2\n.\n1 \u2212 2x \u2212 2x2 + 2x3\nProof. Let \u03b1n (resp. \u03b2n , \u03b3n , \u03b4n ) denote the number of legal placements of\npawns in the first (resp. second, third, fouth) shape on Figure 6 defined\nby black squares (there are n columns in each shape). As in the proof of\nTheorem 7, using horisontal reverse of rows, it is easy to see that \u03b1n = \u03b2n\nand \u03b3n = \u03b4n . Now, according to Observation 1, one has M4,n = \u03b1n \u03b2n = (\u03b1n )2 .\nLet us find \u03b1n .\n\n...\n\n\u03b1n\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n\u03b2n\n\n\u03b3n\n\n\u03b4n\n\nFigure 6: The shapes under consideration.\n\nWe proceed in the same way as we do in Proposition 2. If the first column\nof the first shape is 00 when reading the content of the black squares from\ntop to bottom, we can remove this column since it does not affect the rest\nof the shape. So, in this case the number of legal placements of pawns is\n\u03b2n\u22121 = \u03b1n\u22121 . If instead of 00 we have 01 or 11, the content of the black\nsquares in the second column must be 00, in which case we can remove the\nfirst two columns since they do not affect the rest of the shape. So, in this\ncase we have 2\u03b1n\u22122 placements. The case left is when the first column is 10.\nIn this case the top element of the second column must be 0, and we have\nno information concerning the second element in this column. Thus, in this\ncase we have \u03b3n\u22121 replacements. Therefore,\n\u03b1n = \u03b1n\u22121 + 2\u03b1n\u22122 + \u03b3n\u22121 .\n\n(4)\n\nNow, to proceed further with finding \u03b1n , we need to find \u03b3n . If the element\nin the first column of the third shape is 0, then we can remove this element,\n14\n\n\fwhich gives \u03b2n\u22121 = \u03b1n\u22121 replacements of pawns. If this element is 1, then\nthe bottom element in the second column must be 0, which obviously gives\n\u03b4n\u22121 = \u03b3n\u22121 replacements. Thus,\n\u03b3n = \u03b3n\u22121 + \u03b1n\u22121 .\n\n(5)\n\nNow, from Equations (4) and (5) we have\n\u03b1n = 2\u03b1n\u22121 + 2\u03b1n\u22122 \u2212 2\u03b1n\u22123 ,\nwhich gives the desired result.\nIn the way similar to that Propositions 2 and 3 are proved, on can prove\nthe following two propositions, which we state without proof.\nProposition 4. For all n \u2265 0, M5,n = \u03b1n \u03b2n , where the generating functions\nfor the numbers \u03b1n and \u03b2n are given by\n1 + 7x \u2212 4x2 \u2212 7x3 + 5x4\n(1 + x)(1 \u2212 2x \u2212 6x2 + 10x3 \u2212 4x4 )\nand\n\nrespectively.\n\n1 + 3x + x2 \u2212 5x3 + 4x4\n,\n(1 + x)(1 \u2212 2x \u2212 6x2 + 10x3 \u2212 4x4 )\n\nProposition 5.
