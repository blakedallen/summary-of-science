We end with a few words about\nthe exciting future of these studies heralded by Constellation-X and LISA.\nKey Words: Keywords go here\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\nMore than 40 years ago, it was suggested that\nthe centres of galaxies host supermassive black holes\nand, further, that accretion onto those black holes\npowers active galactic nuclei (AGN; Salpeter 1964;\nZeldovich 1964; Lynden-Bell 1969). Nowadays, the\nobservational evidence in support of this picture is\nsubstantial. Proper motion studies of the stars in the\ncentralmost regions of the Milky Way provide compelling evidence for the presence of a supermassive\nblack hole with a mass of about 3 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 (Eckart\n& Genzel 1997; Ghez et al. 1998, 2000, 2003; Eckart\net al. 2002; Sch\u00f6del et al. 2002). The kinematics\nof rotating central gas disks in several nearby lowluminosity AGN has also provided some of the most\nconvincing evidence for supermassive black holes (for\nexample, M87: Ford et al. 1994, Harms et al. 1994;\nNGC 4258: Miyoshi et al. 1995; Greenhill et al.,\n1995). Finally, spectroscopic studies of stellar kinematics reveal that almost all galaxies studied to date\ndo indeed possess a central supermassive black hole.\nThe very strong correlation between the stellar velocity dispersion of a galaxy's bulge and the mass of\n1 Dept. of Astronomy, Univ. of Maryland, College Park,\nMD 20742, USA\n\nthe black hole it hosts (Gebhardt et al. 2000; Ferrarese & Merritt 2000) argues for an intimate link\nbetween supermassive black hole and galaxy formation, a result of fundamental importance.\nWith the existence of supermassive black holes\nestablished, it is clearly of interest to study them in\ndetail. While of crucial importance for establishing\nthe presence of supermassive black holes, all of the\nkinematic studies mentioned above probe conditions\nand physics at large distances from the black hole,\nr > 103 rg , where rg = GM/c2 and where M is the\nmass of the black hole. However, the energetically\ndominant region of an AGN accretion flow is very\nclose to the central black hole, r < 20rg , where general relativistic effects become strong. This is the region we must consider if we are to truly understand\nthese systems.\nStudies of the innermost regions of black hole\naccretion flows are experiencing an unprecedented\nconfluence of theoretical and observational progress.\nOn the observational side, X-ray spectroscopy of relativistically broadened and distorted emission lines\n(especially the K-shell transitions of iron) are giving us a relatively clean probe of the region within\na few gravitational radii of several AGN black holes\n1\n\n\f2\n\nREYNOLDS\n\n(Tanaka at al. 1995; Fabian et al. 2000; Reynolds\n& Nowak 2003). These studies will be discussed in\nmore detail in the subsequent sections. Theoretical progress has been equally dramatic. With the\nrealization that magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability\nis the basic driving mechanism for accretion disks\naround compact objects (Balbus & Hawley 1991),\nthe community is now constructing increasingly realistic, first-principles simulations of black hole accretion disks. For example, current state-of-the-art\nsimulations include the full relativistic effects of a\nKerr black hole (De Villiers, Hawley & Krolik 2003),\nthe relativistic mapping of disk emission to a distant\nobserver (Armitage & Reynolds 2004), and accurate\ntreatments of radiation pressure (Turner 2004). In\na small number of years, these simulations will be\nable to give first-principles predictions for directly\nobservable quantities, such as the energy spectrum,\ntemporal power spectrum and coherence function of\nthe emitted radiation.\nIn this contribution, we discuss the constraints\non the nature of the black hole and inner accretion flow that have been derived through X-ray iron\nline spectroscopy of the intensely studied Seyfert\n1.2 galaxy MCG\u20136-30-15. In particular, we discuss\nthree main results. Firstly, we show that the highresolution spectrum of MCG\u20136-30-15 resulting from\na half-megasecond observation by the Chandra High\nEnergy Transmission Gratings (HETG) gives strong\nsupport of the basic broad iron line interpretation\nof the X-ray spectrum; this spectrum allows us to\nrule out a model in which the 3-6 keV spectrum curvature (normally interpreted as the redshifted wing\nof the iron line) is due to ionized absorption mimics a broad iron line. Secondly, we show that black\nhole spin is required to explain the breadth of the\nline; a model based on a Schwarzschild black hole requires unphysical distribution of emission across the\ndisk surface. Thirdly, we discuss evidence for the effects of either strong light bending and interaction\nbetween the disk and spinning black hole.\n2. THE ROBUSTNESS OF BROAD IRON LINES:\nNEW EVIDENCE FROM\nHIGH-RESOLUTION SPECTROSCOPY\nAs we have already mentioned, the principal\nspectroscopic tool used to date to study strong gravity is the characterization of the broad iron-K\u03b1 fluorescent emission line (see reviews by Fabian et al.\n2000 and Reynolds & Nowak 2003). The essential\nphysics underlying this phenomenon is straightforward. Moderate-to-high luminosity black hole systems accrete via a radiatively-efficient disk. Even\n\nin the region close to the black hole, such a disk\nwill (apart from a hot and tenuous X-ray emitting\ncorona) remain optically-thick, geometrically-thin,\nalmost Keplerian, and rather cold (T < 105 K for\nAGN). X-ray irradiation of the surface layers of the\ndisk by the corona will excite observable fluorescence\nlines, with iron-K\u03b1 being most prominent due to the\ncombination of its astrophysical abundance and fluorescent yield. This emission line is then subject\nto extreme broadening and skewing due to the both\nthe normal and transverse Doppler effect (associated\nwith the orbital velocity of the disk) as well as the\ngravitational redshift of the black hole (see Fig. 1).\nUnfortunately, nature appears to conspire to ensure that we never have an entirely \"clean\" view of\na broad iron line. In the AGN realm, broad iron\nline signatures are usually observed in spectra that\nalso show clear signatures of absorption by circumnuclear photoionized plasma (the so-called \"warm absorbers\"). This has led some authors to suggest that\nthe \"broad iron line feature\" is actually X-ray continuum radiation that has been etched away by ionized absorption. Within the context of these pure\nabsorption models, strong curvature is introduced\nbelow 7 keV principally by L-shell absorption of intermediate charge-states of iron. Together with the\nsharp K-shell edge at > 7 keV, these models can produce a broad and asymmetric feature that superficially resembles a broad iron line. Such a model was\ncomputed in detail for the case of MCG\u20136-30-15 by\nKinkhabwala (2003) and shown to provide an adequate fit to the time-averaged 350 ks XMM-Newton\ndata of Fabian et al. (2002) without any need for\nrelativistic effects.\nThe Kinkhabwala ionized absorption model for\nMCG\u20136-30-15 makes a generic prediction. The intermediately ionized states of iron (FeXVII\u2013FeXXIII)\nproducing the L-shell absorption noted above will\nimprint a set of K-shell resonant absorption lines at\n6.4\u20136.6 keV (see Fig. 2). With the loss of the XRS\non Suzaku, only the Chandra/HETG has the spectral resolution required to search for and characterize\nthese lines. With this goal, we2 obtained a 522 ksec\nHETG observation of MCG\u20136-30-15; the iron-band\nanalysis of these data was led by Andrew Young and\nhas been reported by us in Young et al. (2005).\nThis spectrum clearly shows a weak rest-frame narrow iron-K\u03b1 fluorescence line at 6.40 keV, as well\nas the K-shell resonant absorption lines of heliumand hydrogen-like iron (see Fig. 3, left panel). The\nhighly ionized iron absorption lines are blueshifted\n2 The Chandra observation was made possible through the\nGuaranteed Time of C. R. Canizares and A. C.

In all cases shown, the range of emitting radii extends from\nthe radius of marginal stability to 50GM/c2 .

All computations have been performed\nwith the new kerrdisk code (Brenneman & Reynolds 2006).\n\nby 2000 km s\u22121 and hence can be attributed to a\nphotoionized wind, probably originating from the accretion disk itself. Most notable, however, are the\nlack of absorption lines from intermediate ionization\nstates of iron in this spectrum as predicted by the\nKinkhabwala model.\nWe have performed a direct test of the \"broad\niron line mimicking warm absorber\" model for\nMCG\u20136-30-15 as follows.\nFirstly, we modeled\nthe 3\u201310 keV spectrum from the 350 ks XMMNewton/EPIC observation with power-law subject\nto a warm absorber (modeled with the XSTAR photoionization code) parameterized by an ionization\nparameter (\u03be = Lion /nr2 ; where Lion is the ionizing luminosity of the source, n is the electron number density of the absorber and r is the distance of\nthe absorbing plasma from the source) and a column\ndensity (NH ); we also excluded the 6\u20138 keV range\nfrom the fit as this is clearly affected by spectral\ncomplexity including a narrow iron line. Best fitting warm absorber parameters are log \u03be = 2.2 \u00b1 0.1\nand log NH = 22.6 \u00b1 0.1 (cgs units). We then fold\nthe best fitting warm absorber through the Chandra/HETG response matrix and compare it to our\ndata (Fig. 3, right panel). The model displays a deep\nabsorption feature at 6.5 keV (rest-frame) which is\nclearly discrepant with our data. Since these absorption feature originate from the same ions that\n\nproduces the broad iron line like spectral curvature,\nthey are a generic and unavoidable prediction of this\nmodel. Thus, we conclude that we can rule out a\nKinkhabwala-like ionized absorption model, further\nbolstering the claim that we are indeed seeing relativistically broad iron line emission.\nSo, why do broad iron lines often appear in conjunction with ionized absorption? Many of the AGN\ndisplaying extremely broadened X-ray reflection features are believed to be accreting at a significant\nfraction of their Eddington limit. These are precisely the same systems that would be expected to\npossess a significant radiatively-driven, photoionized\nwind; such a wind can be launched from the accretion disk itself or be ablated by the radiation field\nfrom the sides of the putative cold, dusty torus of\nAGN unification schemes. Indeed, analysis of warm\nabsorber features in a sample of AGN observed by\nthe Chandra/HETG suggests that the ionized mass\noutflow rates increase as with increasing Eddington\nratio (McKernan, Yaqoob & Reynolds 2006). Thus\nboth broad iron lines and ionized absorbers appear to\nbe part of the phenomenology of moderately rapidly\naccreting sources.\n3. PROPERTIES OF THE BLACK HOLE AND\nTHE INNERMOST ACCRETION FLOW\nHaving established that the relativistic spectral\nbroadening hypothesis remains robust for the case\n\n\f4\n\nREYNOLDS\n\nFig. 2. Example of an ionized absorber model which will mimic a broad iron line when observed at the moderate spectral\nresolution of the it XMM-Newton/EPIC. Parameters characterizing this absorber are log \u03be = 2.2 and log NH = 22.6 (cgs\nunits). The underlying powerlaw has a photon index of \u0393 = 2 and arbitrary normalization. Note the deep absorption\ncomplex at approximately 6.5 keV corresponding to the resonant K\u03b1 absorption lines of intermediate ionization states\nof iron. Models have been computed using the XSTAR photoionization code.\n\nof MCG\u20136-30-15, we will proceed to discuss resulting constraints on the properties of the inner accretion flow and the black hole itself. We begin by discussing constraints on the spin of the black hole. We\nthen proceed to discuss the physics of the innermost\nregions of the accretion disk and the X-ray source.\nFor the remainder of this section, we shall discuss\nconstraints derived from XMM-Newton/EPIC spectroscopy of the broadened X-ray reflection features.\n3.1. Black hole spin\nThere is a common misconception that rapidly\nspinning black holes invariably produce broader and\nmore highly redshifted emission lines than slowly\nspinning black holes. This stems from the fact that\nthe radius of marginal stability (6GM/c2 for a nonrotating black hole) for a prograde accretion disk\npulls-in towards the horizon as the spin-parameter of\nthe black hole is increased. Hence, the line broadening will increase with black hole spin if the line emission is always truncated at the radius of marginal\nstability (see Fig. 4). But it is important to realize that we can produce arbitrarily redshifted and\nbroadened emission lines from around even a nonrotating black hole if nature had the freedom to produce line emission from any radius beyond the horizon (Reynolds & Begelman 1997). This discouraging\nfact has led some authors to conclude that current\niron line profiles contain essentially no information\non the black hole spin (Dovciak, Karas & Yaqoob\n\n2004).\nThis would be an overly bleak assessment of our\nability to constrain black hole spin. Even the application of some rather weak (i.e., general) astrophysical constraints can impose an inner limit on the radii\nat which spectral features can be produced. In order\nto produce any significant iron emission line from the\nregion within the radius of marginal stability (which\nwe shall refer to as the plunging region), the disk in\nthis region must be optically-thick, not too highly\nionized (i.e., a significant fraction of the iron cannot\nbe fully ionized), and illuminated by the hard X-ray\ncontinuum. While much work remains to be done on\nthe physical state of matter in the plunging region, it\nis challenging to construct a model for a disk around\na non-rotating black hole in which there are appreciable spectral features produced by matter inside of\n4.5 \u2212 5GM/c2 (Reynolds & Begelman 1997). If we\nrequire an emitting radius less than this when fitting a non-rotating black hole model to a particular\ndataset, we can claim to have found good evidence\nfor a spinning black hole.\nThis is exactly the situation we find when attempting to fit the XMM-Newton data for the\nSeyfert-1 galaxy MCG\u20136-30-15.\nBrenneman &\nReynolds (2006) perform a detailed re-analysis of the\n350 ks EPIC data (originally presented by Fabian et\nal. 2002) with a spectral model including a multizone dusty warm absorber and a relativisticallyblurred reflection spectrum from an ionized accretion\n\n\fACCRETION PROCESSES IN AGN\n\n5\n\nFig. 3.

All computations have been\nperformed with the new kerrdisk code (Brenneman &\nReynolds 2006).\n\n1.2\n\ndisk. They find that, if one imposes a Schwarzschild\ngeometry, any adequate fit requires most of the iron\nline emission to occur at a disk radius of 3GM/c2 .\nThis is extremely deep within the plunging radius\n(i.e., the region within the radius of marginal stability at 6GM/c2 ), with radial velocities of the order of half the speed of light expected at that location. Continuity of baryon number demands that the\nplasma at this location be extremely tenuous. Thus,\nthe irradiating X-rays required to produce the observed X-ray reflection signatures would photoionize\nthis material to an extremely high degree, rendering\nit incapable of imprinting any atomic features on the\nspectrum. Thus, we conclude that a Schwarschild\nblack hole does not allow a physically viable model\nto be constructed for this spectrum.\nIn principle, the contribution of the plunging region to the broad iron line profile can be quantified using a detailed model of X-ray reflection from\nthe plunging region which would need to include the\neffects of finite optical depth and photoionization\n(Reynolds & Begelman 1997). Significantly more\ntheoretical work is required for these models to stand\na chance of describing reality. However, one can illustrate the potential power of broad iron lines to\ndetermine black hole spin by the returning to the\nassumption that there are no X-ray reflection features from the flow within the radius of marginal\n\n\f6\n\nREYNOLDS\n\nstability. As shown by Laura Brenneman elsewhere\nin this volume, applying spectrum models employing\nthis assumption to MCG\u20136-30-15 suggests that the\nblack hole is rapidly rotating, a > 0.93.\n3.2. Confrontation between simple accretion theory\nand X-ray spectral data\nEven before the observational evidence for black\nhole accretion disks became compelling, the basic\ntheory of such disks had been extensively developed.\nBuilding upon the non-relativistic theory of Shakura\n& Sunyaev (1973), Novikov & Thorne (1974) and\nPage & Thorne (1974) developed the \"standard\"\nmodel of a geometrically-thin, radiatively-efficient,\nsteady-state, viscous accretion disk around an isolated Kerr black hole. In addition to the assumptions\nalready listed, it is assumed that the viscous torque\noperating within the disk becomes zero at the radius\nof marginal stability, r = rms . Physically, this was\njustified by assuming that the accretion flow would\npass through a sonic point close to r = rms and hence\nflow ballistically (i.e., \"plunge\") into the black hole.\nThe zero-torque condition at the radius of marginal\nstability leads to a predicted dissipation profile which\npeaks at r \u2248 1.5rms and then rolls over to zero at\nthe radius of marginal stability.\nThe Novikov-Thorne disk model gives us a well\ndefined starting point for comparing theory with\ndata. One more step is required, however; we need\nto relate the underlying dissipation in the accretion\ndisk (given by the Novikov-Thorne model) to the\nX-ray irradiation of the disk surface (which determines the observed broadening profile of the X-ray\nreflection spectrum). For the moment, we make the\nsimplest assumption that the primary continuum Xray source is located a small distance above the disk\nsurface (the \"local corona assumption\") and radiates\na fixed fraction of the energy dissipated in the underlying disk. This model has been explicitly compared with the first XMM-Newton observation of\nMCG\u20136-30-15 which caught the source in its enigmatic \"Deep Minimum State\" (Wilms et al. 2001;\nReynolds et al. 2004; see Iwasawa et al. 1996 for the\noriginal identification and study of the Deep Minimum State). Reynolds et al. (2004) showed that\nthe \"vanilla\" Novikov-Thorne model supplemented\nby the local corona approximation fails to produce\nenough relativistic broadening, even in the case of a\nnear-extremal (a = 0.998) rotating black hole (see\nFig. 5a). Essentially, there is more X-ray irradiation\nat the smallest radii compared with the predictions\nof this model.\nOne can attempt to rescue the Novikov-Thorne\ndisk model by supposing that a larger portion of the\n\ntotal dissipation in the disk is channeled into the Xray emitting corona as one moves to smaller radii.\nHowever, since 30\u201350% of the bolometric power of\nMCG\u20136-30-15 seems to emerge through the X-ray\nemitting corona, one cannot decouple it entirely from\nthe dissipation distribution. In the most extreme\nmodel (which provides an adequate but not the best\nfit to the data), all of the dissipated energy is channeled into the X-ray emitting corona within the central 5GM/c2 , while the X-ray production efficiency\nis zero beyond that radius.\n3.3. Torqued accretion disks\nIn attempting to reconcile the conflict between\ndata and disk theory noted above, one may consider either modifications to the basic accretion disk\ndynamics and/or deviations from the local corona\nassumption. To begin with, we preserve the local\ncorona assumption and examine whether the model\ncan be brought into line with the data via a change\nof inner boundary condition.\nEven when originally setting up the zero-torque\nboundary condition at the radius of marginal stability, Page & Thorne (1974) noted that magnetic\nfields may allow this zero-torque boundary condition to be violated. Given the modern viewpoint\nof accretion disks, that the very \"viscosity\" driving\naccretion is due to magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nturbulence, the idea that the zero-torque boundary\ncondition can be violated has been revived by recent\ntheoretical work, starting with Gammie (1999) and\nKrolik (1999a). In independent treatments, these\nauthors show that significant energy and angular momentum can be extracted from matter within the radius of marginal stability via magnetic connections\nwith the main body of the accretion disk. Agol &\nKrolik (2000) have performed the formal extension\nof the standard Novikov-Thorne model to include a\ntorque at r = rms and show that the extra dissipation associated with this torque produces a very\ncentrally concentrated dissipation profile. As shown\nby Gammie (1999), Agol & Krolik (2000), and Li\n(2002), this process can lead to an extraction (and\nsubsequent dissipation) of spin energy and angular\nmomentum from the rotating black hole by the accretion disk. In these cases, the magnetic forces might\nbe capable of placing the innermost part of the flow\non negative energy orbits, allowing a Penrose process to be realized (we note that Williams [2003] has\nalso argued for the importance of a non-magnetic,\nparticle-particle and particle-photon scattering mediated Penrose process). The basic notion that the\nplunging region exerts significant torques on the disk\n\n\fACCRETION PROCESSES IN AGN\n\n7\n\nFig. 5. Broad iron line fit assuming that the line emission tracks the underlying disk dissipation of (a) a standard\n(Novikov & Thorne 1974) accretion disk and, (b) an Agol & Krolik (2000) torqued accretion disk. Modified from\nReynolds et al. (2004).\n\nhas been verified through both pseudo-Newtonian\n(Hawley 2000; Reynolds & Armitage 2001) and fully\nrelativistic MHD simulations of accretion disks (e.g.,\nMcKinney & Gammie 2004; Hirose et al. 2004).\nA second mechanism by which the central accretion\ndisk can be torqued is via a direct magnetic connection between the inner accretion disk and the (rotating) event horizon of the black hole. In this case, as\nlong as the angular velocity of the event horizon exceeds that of the inner disk, energy and angular momentum of the spinning black hole can be extracted\nvia the Blandford-Znajek mechanism (Blandford &\nZnajek 1977). We note that field lines that directly\nconnect the rotating event horizon with the body of\nthe accretion disk through the plunging region are\nseen in recent General Relativistic MHD simulations\nof black hole accretion (e.g., Hirose et al. 2004).\nReynolds et al. (2004) has shown that a torqued\ndisk can readily explain the Deep Minimum spectrum provided the source is assumed to be in a\ntorque-dominated state (or, in the terminology of\nAgol & Krolik [2000], an \"infinite-efficiency\" state)\nwhereby the power associated with the innermost\ntorque is instantaneously dominating the accretion\npower (see Fig. 5b). In other words, the X-ray\ndata suggest that during this Deep Minimum state\nof MCG\u20136-30-15 the power derived from the black\nhole spin greatly exceeds that derived from accre-\n\ntion. Of course, this state of affairs cannot last forever or else the central black hole in MCG\u20136-30-15\nwould spin down to a point where it could no longer\nprovide this power. At some point in its history, the\nsystem must be in an accretion-dominated phase in\nwhich the black hole is spun up. However, even in\nits spin-dominated state, the spin-down timescale of\nthe central black hole is of the order of 100 million\nyears or more. Thus we could envisage a situation\nin which the system shines via a quasi-steady-state,\nspin-dominated accretion disk. There are hints,\nthough, that accretion disks may switch between\nspin-dominated and accretion-dominated on much\nshorter timescales. In its normal spectral state, the\nX-ray reflection features in MCG\u20136-30-15 are much\nless centrally concentrated than in the Deep Minimum State, suggesting that the normal state might\nbe accretion-dominated. It is also important to note\nthat this system can switch between its normal state\nand the Deep Minimum State in as little as 5\u201310 ksec\n(Iwasawa et al. 1996), which corresponds to only a\nfew dynamical timescales of the inner accretion disk.\nThus it is of interest to consider the physics of an accretion disk that undergoes a rapid torquing event.\nWith this motivation, and guided by the timevariable inner disk torques seen in MHD disk simulations (e.g., Reynolds & Armitage 2001), Garofalo & Reynolds (2005) generalized the torqued-disk\n\n\f8\n\nREYNOLDS\n\nFig. 6. Evolution of disk in Schwarzschild spacetime for torque at R/M=10. Panel (a) shows the surface density profile\njust after the torquing event begins as well as the steady-state torqued profile is approached (dashed-line:t = 10000).\nPanel (b) shows the early stages in the evolution of the surface density profile with the solid line being the untorqued\nsteady-state profile (dashed-line:t = 0.8, dot-dashed-line:t = 2.53, dotted-line:t = 8.0). Panel (c) shows the untorqued\nsteady-state profile (solid-line) as well as the late-time evolution of the torqued profile (dashed-line:t = 25, dot-dashedline:t = 80, dotted-line:t = 253). Panel (d) shows the early evolution of the dissipation function with lines and times\ncorresponding to those of panel (b). The qualitative feature is again a drop inward of the torque location and an increase\noutward. Panel (e) shows the late-time evolution of dissipation function with lines and times analogous to those of panel\n(c) while panel (f) shows the observed luminosity starting at untorqued steady-state with t=0. The observed luminosity\nis determined for angles of 10 (solid-line), 30 (dashed-line), 60 (dot-dashed line) degrees, and 80 degrees (dotted line).\nAlthough the magnitude of the observed luminosity is not the same in the untorqued steady-state for all angles, we\nhave normalized them in order to see the change with respect to the untorqued state. Note the presence of a drop in\nthe luminosity as the angle of inclination decreases. Figures from Garofalo & Reynolds (2005).\n\nmodels of Agol & Krolik (2000) to include explicit\ntime dependence. They showed that the response\nof an initially untorqued accretion disk to a sudden\n(prograde) torquing event has two phases; an initial damming of the accretion flow together with a\npartial draining of the disk interior to the torque location, followed by a replenishment of the inner disk\nas the system achieves a new (torqued) steady-state.\nThis is illustrated in Fig. 6 which shows the evolution of the surface density and dissipation profiles for\nthe example of a sporadically torqued disk around\na Schwarzschild black hole. Garofalo & Reynolds\n(2005) propose that some of the spectral changes in\nMCG\u20136-30-15 may be due to time-variable magnetic\ntorques between the disk and the plunge region or\nblack hole itself. In particular, they suggest that the\nextremely centrally concentrated dissipation inferred\nduring the deep minimum state is caused by the on-\n\nset of a strong inner disk torque. To explain why the\noverall X-ray luminosity of the disk drops during this\nevent (despite the fact that the inner torque is doing\nwork on the disk), Garofalo & Reynolds (2005) suggest that the strong returning radiation associated\nwith this inner torque leads to a Compton-cooling\ninduced collapse of the X-ray emitting corona in all\nbut the innermost regions of the accretion disk.\n3.4. Beyond the local corona assumption: the effects\nof light bending\nAnother possible explanation for a highly centrally concentrated X-ray irradiation profile is a\nbreakdown of the local-corona assumption. If the Xray emitting source is a significant height above the\noptically-thick part of the accretion disk, the hard\nX-ray continuum photons will be gravitationally focused into the central regions of the accretion disk\n\n\fACCRETION PROCESSES IN AGN\n(see Andy Fabian's contribution in these proceedings). Aspects of this scenario have been explored by\nseveral authors including Martocchia & Matt (1996),\nReynolds & Begelman (1997) and Miniutti & Fabian\n(2004).\nThis suggests an alternative picture for MCG\u2013630-15 in which the Deep Minimum State is produced\nwhen the X-ray source is located at mid/high latitudes very close to the black hole. Reynolds & Begelman (1997) showed that both the changes in the iron\nline profiles (as then seen by ASCA) and the change\nin the level of the primary continuum can be reproduced by a model in which a fairly constant compact\nX-ray source on the symmetry/spin axis of the accretion disk is shifting its vertical location. When the\nsource is close to the black hole, the primary X-rays\nare strongly focused onto the central disk leading to\nboth a very broad line and a diminished observed\nprimary X-ray continuum flux. Miniutti & Fabian\n(2004) have extended this model and shown that it\nprovides an excellent description of spectral variability seen in all phases of the XMM-Newton data for\nMCG\u20136-30-15.\nWe note that the light bending scenario does not\ndiminish the need for exotic spin-related astrophysics\n- the base of a spin-driven magnetic jet is an obvious candidate for this elevated continuum X-ray\nsource.\n3.5. The mysterious variability of the iron line and\nthe Compton reflection hump\nWhile both complex accretion disk dynamics\n(e.g., magnetic torques between the plunging region\nand the disk-proper) and light bending of the primary X-ray emission almost certainly are both relevant, it is useful to ask how we might distinguish\nbetween these two straw-man models. Spectral variability is likely the key.\nNaively, if the geometry of the system and the\nionization state of the disk remain unchanged, one\nexpects the fluorescent iron line flux to track the\nstrength of the primary X-ray continuum (i.e., one\nexpected a constant iron line equivalent width).\nWhile this is seen in XMM-Newton data of MCG\u2013630-15 for the low flux states (Reynolds et al. 2004;\nalso see Fig. 7), the iron line flux appears to \"saturate\" at higher fluxes implying that the equivalent width decreases with increasing continuum flux\n(Fabian et al. 2002). As shown by Miniutti &\nFabian (2004), this behaviour has a natural explanation within the light-bending scenario, with the\nstrong light bending changing the effective geometry\nof the system in just the correct manner. Within\n\n9\n\nthe local-corona, torqued-disk scenario, one needs to\nposit changes in the ionization state of the surface\nlayers of the disk which conspire to cause an effective\nsaturation of the total line flux.\nAn equally important but little discussed mystery comes from examining the dependence between\nthe iron line flux and the strength of the Compton reflection hump (seen at 20\u201330 keV). Naively, assuming\na fixed ionization state of the reflector, the iron line\nequivalent width should be proportional to the relative flux associated with the Compton hump (compared with the direct continuum flux) since both of\nthese spectral features are produced by the X-ray reflection process. The spectral variability in the Miniutti & Fabian (2004) light bending model is primarily due to a change in the fraction of primary X-ray\ncontinuum photons are directed into the disk plane\nand, hence, would predict that this proportionality\nbe preserved. This is not what is observed. Observations by the Proportional Counter Array (PCA)\non the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) allows\nus to measure both the iron line equivalent width\nand the reflection hump. In a phenomenon first\nfound by Chiang et al. (2000) in NGC 5548, Lee\net al. (2001) showed that the iron line equivalent\nwidth and the relative normalization of the Compton reflection hump are anti-correlated. This result\nremains valid (and is more generally true for Seyfert\n1 nuclei as a class) when the RXTE/PCA data\nare re-analyzed using the latest refinements of the\nbackground model and spectral calibration (Mattson, Weaver & Reynolds, in preparation).\nIf this behaviour is further confirmed (e.g., by\nSuzaku), it will strongly suggest that changes in the\nionization state of the accretion disk are playing an\nimportant part in determining the spectral variability and must be explicitly modeled.\n4. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE HOPES\nCurrent data from XMM-Newton and Chandra\nare already allowing us to probe black hole physics\nwithin a few gravitational radii of the event horizon, and may well be giving us the first observational glimpses of physics within the ergosphere. But\nthis is just the beginning of X-ray astronomy's exploration of strong gravity and black hole accretion,\nnot the end of the road. The enormous throughput of\nConstellation-X will allow us to probe detailed time\nvariability of the iron line. Dynamical timescale line\nvariability, an easy goal for Constellation-X, will allow us to follow non-axisymmetric structures in the\ndisk as they orbit (Armitage & Reynolds 2004; also\nsee Iwasawa, Miniutti & Fabian [2004] for the first\n\n\f10\n\nREYNOLDS\n\nFig. 7.

Furthermore, line variability on the light crossing time will allow us to probe\nrelativistic reverberation signatures (Reynolds et al.\n1999; Young & Reynolds 2000), essentially giving us\na direct probe of the null geodesics in the space-time.\nTogether, these variability signatures will take their\nplace along side gravitational wave experiments in\nallowing true tests of strong-field GR.\nThere is no compelling reason to believe that\nGR fails on the macroscopic scales probed by either\nX-ray or gravitational wave studies of astrophysical\nblack holes. In the event that GR is verified, both\nX-ray and gravitational wave observations will allow unambiguous measurements of black hole spins.\nGravitational wave observations with LISA of a stellar mass black hole spiraling into a 106 M\u2299 black hole\n(a so-called Extreme Mass Ratio Inspiral; EMRI)\nwill allow precision measurement of the supermassive\nblack hole's spin as well as tests of the no-hair theorem and the Kerr metric. X-ray spectroscopy with\nConstellation-X provides a crucial parallel track of\nstudy in which we can obtain measurements of black\nhole spin across the whole mass range of astrophysical black holes (i.e., stellar, intermediate, and su-\n\npermassive) using spectral features that are already\nknown to exist. Only then can the demographics\nand astrophysical relevance of black hole spin truly\nbe gauged.\nWe thank the conference organizers for a stimulating meeting.
