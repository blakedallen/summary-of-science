The use of hydrogenbased energy in practical applications such as fuel cell vehicles, however, requires the development of safe and efficient hydrogen storage technology. Complex hydrides including the light metal lithium (Li) have sufficient gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity, and many researches\nand development about the lithium complex hydride such\nas LiBH4 1,2,3 and LiNH2 4,5,6 have been done recently.\nParticularly, LiBH4 can desorb about 14 mass% of hydrogen by the following thermal decomposition :\n3\nLiBH4 \u2192 LiH + B + H2 .\n2\n\n(1)\n\nHowever, the experimental value of enthalpy of this reaction is 69 kJ/mol H2 1 and LiBH4 is too stable to release\nhydrogen at ambient condition. High temperature and\nhigh pressure are needed for rehydriding reaction, so its\nreversibility becomes a problem for practical use.\nZ\u00fcttel et al.1 investigated the hydrogen desorption\nfrom LiBH4 in details, and reported that the thermal desorption spectra of LiBH4 mixed with SiO2 -powder exhibited three hydrogen desorption peaks. These peaks were\nobserved around 500 K, 550 K and 600 K, and the products corresponded to \"LiBH3.6 \" , \"LiBH3 \" and \"LiBH2 \"\n, respectively. The compounds in quotes were nominal\ncompositions estimated from amount of desorbed hydrogen. This is a strong evidence for the existence of the\nintermediate compounds , and the hydrogen desorption\nreaction takes place in at least two steps not a single step\nlike in Eq.(1). Although low temperature release of hydrogen and improvement of reversibility can be expected\n\nby use of the intermediate compound, little attention has\nbeen paid yet.\nIn this study, the stability of the intermediate compounds of LiBH4 has been investigated theoretically and\nwe clarify a hydriding/dehydriding process of LiBH4 .\nThe thermal desorption experiment observed a structural\ntransition around 380 K and the melting of the compound\nat 550 K. The stability of the solid phases at absolute\nzero temperature is mainly discussed here. In Sec. II, we\ndescribe the details of the computational method and\nthe possible intermediate compounds of LiBH4 . Section III reports the calculated results on the stability\nof some candidate compounds. And then, we discuss\nthe hydriding/dehydriding reaction via the intermediate\ncompounds. Furthermore, the electronic structures and\n\u0393-phonon frequencies on the most stable compound are\nstudied. We also investigate the stability of the borane\ncomplex anions, and then compare with the solid compounds.\n\nII.\n\nCOMPUTATIONAL DETAILS\n\nFirst-principles calculations have been performed by\nthe ultrasoft pseudopotential method7 based on the density functional theory.8 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) formula9 is applied to the exchangecorrelation energy.\nThe interaction between the ion cores and electrons\nis described by the ultrasoft pseudopotential7 , and the\nnorm-conservation constraint10 is imposed on Li for\nthe calculation efficiency improvement. The scalarrelativistic all-electron calculations are first carried out\non the free atoms(ions). We chose 2s and 2p states for\n\n\f2\nboth Li and B pseudopotential as the reference states\nwith the cutoff radii of 2 a.u. (Li) and 1.5 a.u. (B), respectively. A single projector function is used for each\nangular momentum component. The 3d state is treated\nas the local part of pseudopotential. The hydrogen pseudopotential is constructed from 1s, 2s and 2p states with\nthe cutoff radii of 1.1 a.u.(s) and 1.2 a.u. (p). We\nuse double projector functions for the s component and\na single projector function for the p component. For\nall pseudopotentials, the pseudo-wave functions and the\npseudo-charge-augmentation functions are optimized by\na method similar to that proposed by Rappe et al.11 Also,\nthe partial core correction12 is taken into account for Li\nand B pseudopotentials.\nIn the solid-state calculations, the pseudo-wave functions are expanded by plane waves with a cutoff energy\nequal to 15 hartrees. The cutoff energy for the charge\ndensity and potential is set to be 120 hartrees. The integral over the Brillouin zone is approximated by the summation on the k-grid elements of which the edge lengths\ncloser to the target value of 0.15\u00c5\u22121 as possible. We\nconfirmed that these calculation conditions gave a good\nconvergence of energy within 0.002 eV/atom. The preconditioned conjugate-gradient technique is employed to\nminimize the Kohn-Sham energy functional. A procedure based on the iterative diagonalization scheme13 and\nthe Broyden charge mixing method14 is adopted in this\nstudy. Optimization of crystal structures is performed till\nthe atomic forces and the macroscopic stresses become\nless than 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 hartree/bohr and 0.1 GPa, respectively. During the structural optimization process, the\npartial occupation numbers near the Fermi level are determined by the Fermi-Dirac distribution function with\nkB T = 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 hartrees. The Helmholtz free-energy\nfunctional,15 including the entropy term, is minimized\ninstead of the Kohn-Sham energy functional. Then, the\nimproved tetrahedron method16 is used in order to minimize the Kohn-Sham energy functional in the optimized\nstructure. The dynamical matrix is calculated by the\nforce-constant method17 to obtain the \u0393 phonon frequencies. The atomic displacement is set to be 0.02 \u00c5. The\nfurther details of calculation are described in Refs. 2, 13\nand references therein.\nAs the candidates of the intermediate compounds, the\nexisting alkali metal-B-H materials are used. For example, it is well known that boron (B) and hydrogen (H)\nform inorganic compounds called 'borane' and the compounds of CsB3 H8 ,18 K2 B6 H6 ,19 and K2 B12 H12 20 are\nreported. The space group of crystal structure for the\ncompound CsB3 H8 is Ama2 (No.40) and cation Cs+ and\nanion [B3 H8 ]\u2212 are arranged same as the NaCl-type structure with an orthorhombic distortion. The crystal structures of K2 B6 H6 and K2 B12 H12 are best described as an\nanti-CaF2 -type arrangement with K+ cation in the center of a tetrahedron formed by [Bn Hn ]2\u2212 dianions. We\nfirst assumed that LiB3 H8 , Li2 B6 H6 and Li2 B12 H12 compounds, which had the same crystal structures as existing CsB3 H8 , K2 B6 H6 and K2 B12 H12 , respectively. The\n\nstability of these candidates was evaluated using the firstprinciples calculations. Since the existence of a series of\ncloso-type dianions [Bn Hn ]2\u2212 (n = 5 \u2212 12) is also well\nknown, our calculation have been expanded to Li2 Bn Hn\n(n = 5 \u2212 12) compounds. Although Li atom and [Bn Hn ]\ncluster are arranged in the anti-CaF2 -type structure and\nthe unit cell parameters are supposed to be a facecentered-cubic symmetry (a = b = c, \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b4 = 90\u25e6\n) as starting points for the structural optimization, the\noutput relaxed compounds have different symmetry depending on the structure of [Bn Hn ] clusters. The alkali metal salt of monoclinic K2 B12 (OH)12 21 with closo[B12 (OH)12 ]2\u2212 dianions has been reported, and monoclinic Li2 B12 H12 with similar crystal structure is also examined.\nIII.\nA.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nStability of candidate compounds : LiBx Hy\n\nTable I shows the calculated results on the structural parameters and the cohesive energies of LiB3 H8\nand Li2 Bn Hn (n = 5 \u2212 12). We denote the cubic\nLi2 B12 H12 based on K2 B12 H12 with type-1 and monoclinic Li2 B12 H12 based on K2 B12 (OH)12 with type2, respectively. Compared with the cohesive energy\nof two type of Li2 B12 H12 , the value of monoclinic\nLi2 B12 H12 (type-2) is larger than that of type-1. Therefore, the type-2 Li2 B12 H12 is easy to form. After the\nnext paragraph, the only result concerning monoclinic\nLi2 B12 H12 (type-2) is shown.\nThe enthalpy of formation for hydriding reactions including LiBH4 from LiH (NaCl-type), \u03b1-B (rhombohedral), and H2 molecule are given in Table II, where the\nzero-point energy corrections are not taken into consideration. They are provided using calculated cohesive energies of 2.3609 eV/atom for LiH, 6.2013 eV/atom for \u03b1-B,\n2.2689 eV/atom for H2 molecule, and 3.1501 eV/atom\nfor LiBH4 (orthorhombic P nma symmetry), respectively.\nThe enthalpies of formation for Li2 Bn Hn (n = 10, 11, 12)\nare more negative than that for LiBH4 . Therefore these\ncompounds have a great potential for generating in hydriding reactions from LiH and \u03b1-B as the intermediate\nphase of LiBH4 .\nIn order to understand the stability of each compound\nintuitively, we represent the enthalpy of formation corresponding to the following reaction with hydrogen of \u03b4\nmole in Fig. 1 :\n1\u2212\u03b4\n(1 \u2212 \u03b4)(x \u2212 1)\nLiBx Hy +\nLiH,\nx\nx\n(2)\nwhere \u03b4 = (y \u2212 1)/(2x + y \u2212 1) shows the mole fraction\nof H2 and x \u2265 1. From Fig. 1, monoclinic Li2 B12 H12\nis formed as the intermediate compound of the hydriding/dehydriding reaction of LiBH4 , because the actual\nreaction goes along the lowest state of enthalpy.

The reaction enthalpy for Eq.(5) is 1.30eV per LiBH4 formula unit\n(84kJ/molH2), which is in good agreement with reported\nvalue of 1.28eV per LiBH4 formula unit in Ref.24. On the\nother hand, the reaction enthalpy of Eq.(3) is 0.63eV per\nLiBH4 formula unit. Therefore, the dehydriding reaction\nvia the intermediate compound Li2 B12 H12 is energetically more preferable one.\n\n10\n0\n\nWe also calculated other possible crystal structures such as Cu2 B10 H10 -type22 and [Li(thp)3 ]2 [B11 H11 ]type.23 Moreover, we performed the calculation for the\n\u0393-phonon frequencies of the candidate materials. If there\nwas a soft-mode, we lowered crystal structure symmetry with moving the atoms along the direction of the\nsoft-mode eigenvectors. The maximum gain of cohesive\nenergy was 0.03 eV/atom for Li2 B6 H6 , however, no compound or crystal structure more stable than monoclinic\nLi2 B12 H12 was found. The present calculation result on\nthe energy of monoclinic Li2 B12 H12 provides the upper\nlimit value for the thermodynamic stability. In conclusion, the existence of the intermediate compound of\nLiBH4 was predicted theoretically.\nRecently Kang et al.24 have reported that LiBH and\nLiB are the intermediate phases of LiBH4 , and propose\nthe dehydriding reaction of LiBH4 through LiBH as follows :\n\nLi2B12H12\nLiBH4\n\n-50\n\nB.\nFIG. 1: Enthalpy of formation relative to (1 \u2212 \u03b4)[LiH + B]\nand molecular H2 of \u03b4 mole (reaction Eq.(2) in text), as a\nfunction of the mole fraction of H2 , \u03b4.\n\n:\n1\n5\n13\nLi2 B12 H12 + LiH + H2 ,\n12\n6\n12\n3\n\u2194 LiH + B + H2 .\n2\n\nLiBH4 \u2194\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nThe enthalpy without zero-point energy effects and\nhydrogen content of the first reaction (Eq.(3)) are\n56 kJ/mol H2 and 10 mass% and those of the second reaction (Eq.(4)) are 125 kJ/mol H2 and 4 mass%, respectively. These results agree with the experimental ones,\nwhich reported that 9 mass% of hydrogen are liberated\nin the hydrogen desorption peak in thermal desorption\nspectra of LiBH4 mixed with SiO2 -powder in Ref. 1. The\nenthalpy value of 56 kJ/mol H2 for the first reaction is\nlower than computational one of 75 kJ/mol H2 for direct\ndehydriding reaction of LiBH4 (Eq.(1)).2 So the hydrogen\ndesorption and absorption can occur at low temperature\nand pressure comparatively by using this intermediate\ncompound.\n\nIntermediate compound : Li2 B12 H12\n\nHere we describe the fundamental properties, such as\nthe crystal structure, the electronic structure, and the \u0393\nphonon frequencies, on Li2 B12 H12 which is expected as\nintermediate compound of LiBH4 .\nOptimized crystal structure model of monoclinic\nLi2 B12 H12 is shown in Fig. 2. The bond lengths between B and H atom of Li2 B12 H12 are 1.20 \u2212 1.21 \u00c5,\nand they are very close to those for LiBH4 (1.23 \u2212 1.24\n\u00c5) reported in Ref. 2. As for the B-B bond lengths\nof intra-icosahedron, the values of 1.779 \u2212 1.811 \u00c5 for\nLi2 B12 H12 are comparable to the experimental ones for\nthe \u03b1-rhombohedral boron (\u03b1-B) of 1.751 \u2212 1.806 \u00c5,25\ntoo. Since boron crystal has the icosahedral B12 cluster\nas a common structural component, the decomposition of\n[B12 H12 ]2\u2212 anion into B12 cluster and hydrogen molecule\nis easy to understand.\nFigure 3 shows the total and partial density of states\n(DOS) for Li2 B12 H12 , which denotes that it has the energy gap of 5.60 eV. Since there is little contribution of\nLi orbital for occupied states, Li2 B12 H12 consists of Li+\nand [B12 H12 ]2\u2212 ions. The orbitals of B and H hybridize\neach other and the feature of occupied states in DOS is\nanalogous with the distribution of the computed energies\nof the bonding molecular orbitals in [B12 H12 ]2\u2212 .26\n\n\f5\n100\nTOTAL\n50\n\nDOS(states/eV unit-cell)\n\n0\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Crystal structure model of monoclinic\nLi2 B12 H12 (type-2).

The phonon density of states is shown in Fig. 4.\nIt is divided into three regions in the same case as LiBH4 .\nThe first region is less than 300 cm\u22121 where the displacements of Li atoms are dominant. The second region is\nbetween 450 cm\u22121 and 1100 cm\u22121 where the B-H bond\nof [B12 H12 ]2\u2212 dianions vibrates with changing in angle\nbetween them (bending modes), and the third region\nis between 2400 cm\u22121 and 2600 cm\u22121 where the interatomic distance of B-H bond is changing along bond axis\n(stretching modes). The frequencies of bending modes\nare lower than LiBH4 described in Ref. 2, while stretching modes are higher.\nThe investigation using in situ Raman spectroscopy is\neffective for the confirmation of the short-range order or\nbonding of LiBH4 .27 We examine the atomistic vibrations\nof LiBH4 during heating by in situ Raman spectroscopy,\nand the identification of spectra modes originating from\nLi2 B12 H12 is now in progress.28\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n1500 -1 2000\nFrequency (cm )\n\n2500\n\nFIG. 4: Phonon density of states for monoclinic Li2 B12 H12 .\nThe contribution of the TO \u0393-phonon modes indicated by vertical bars is only taken into account and the Gaussian broadening with a width of 30 cm\u22121 is used.\n\nreactions:\n2LiH + nB +\n\nn\u22122\nH2 \u2194 Li2 Bn Hn ,\n2\n\n(6)\n\nand\nnB +\n\nn\nH2 + 2e\u2212 \u2194 [Bn Hn ]2\u2212 ,\n2\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the energies are normalized by the number of B-H\npairs for comparison purposes.

This is probably due\nto the fact that the electrostatic interaction between Li+\nand [Bn Hn ]2\u2212 is not sensitive to n and a large part of this\nenergy cancels out with that of LiH in Eq. (6). Among\nthe closo-type dianions considered here, [B12 H12 ]2\u2212 is the\nmost stable one.\nLiBH4 desorbs hydrogen at temperatures above the\nmelting point. The latent heat of fusion has been reported30 to be 0.078 eV/formula-unit for LiBH4 and\nsimilar values are expected for Li2 Bn Hn , which is considerably smaller than the energy difference between\n[B12 H12 ]2\u2212 and other close-type dianions. The stability\nof the [B12 H12 ]2\u2212 anion supports our main conclusion in\nthis study, that is, the intermediate phase suggested by\nthe experiment is Li2 B12 H12 .\nIV.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe have examined the stability of LiB3 H8 and\nLi2 Bn Hn (n = 5 \u2212 12) , which are the possible intermediate compounds of LiBH4 , by the first-principles calculation. Our computational results for enthalpy of the\nhydriding reactions provide that monoclinic Li2 B12 H12 is\nthe most stable one among the candidates. The follow-\n\n1\n\ning hydriding/dehydriding process of LiBH4 is proposed\n: LiBH4 \u2194 1/12Li2B12 H12 + 5/6LiH +13/12H2 \u2194 LiH\n+ B + 3/2H2 . The hydrogen content of the first and\nthe second reaction are 10 mass% and 4 mass%, respectively, which agree well with the thermal desorption spectra (TDS) experiment on LiBH4 .1 The heat of formation\nwithout zero point energy corrections for the first reaction, which is estimated from the solid state LiBH4 with\nP nma symmetry (not liquid LiBH4 ), is 56 kJ/molH2 .\nThis value is lower than that for the direct reaction\n(LiBH4 \u2194 LiH + B + 23 H2 ). Therefore, low temperature release of hydrogen can be expected by use of this\nintermediate compound.\nWe have calculated the electronic structure and the \u0393phonon frequencies of monoclinic Li2 B12 H12 . This compound has the energy gap of 5.60 eV and consists of Li+\nand [B12 H12 ]2\u2212 ions. From the phonon density of states,\nit is predicted that its bending modes have lower frequencies than that of LiBH4 ,2 while stretching modes\nare higher. The identification of the experimental Raman spectra modes originating from Li2 B12 H12 is now in\nprogress.\nThe stability of closo borane complex anions [Bn Hn ]2\u2212\nwas also examined. We found a fairly good correlation\nbetween the formation energies of the solid phases and\nthe isolated dianions. This result supports the validity\nof the intermediate compound indicated in the TDS experiment being Li2 B12 H12 .\nThere are various kinds of borane, such as nido-type\n[Bn Hn+4 ] and arachno-type [Bn Hn+6 ], in addition to\ncloso-type borane [Bn Hn+2 ].31 The nido and arachno borane are derived from closo borane by removing one and\ntwo vertices, respectively. These generate the salts in the\nionized state as well as closo-type dianions. These alkali\nmetal salts are also the candidates of the intermediate\ncompound of LiBH4 . We will study the details of the\nhydriding/dehydriding process for LiBH4 including the\nstability of these materials in future.\n\nA. Z\u00fcttel, P. Wenger, S. Rentsch, P. Sudan, Ph.
