BINDER AND L. DEMARCO\nAbstract. Let F be a polynomial endomorphism of Cn which extends holomorphically to CPn . We prove that the dimension of \u03bcF , the pluriharmonic measure\non the boundary of the filled Julia set of F , is bounded above by 2n \u2212 1.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe dimension of a probability measure on a metric space is defined as the minimal Hausdorff dimension of a set of full measure. In this paper, we show that the\ndimension of pluriharmonic measure in Cn is bounded above by 2n\u22121 when it arises\nas the measure of maximal entropy for a regular polynomial endomorphism.\nFor a compact set K in Cn , pluriharmonic measure is defined as\n\u03bcK := ddc GK \u2227 * * * \u2227 ddc GK ,\nwhere GK is the pluricomplex Green's function of K with pole at infinity, d = \u2202 + \u2202 \u0304\ni  \u0304\nand dc = 2\u03c0\n(\u2202 \u2212 \u2202). The support of \u03bcK is contained in the Shilov boundary of K.\nSee \u00a72.\nLet F : Cn \u2192 Cn be a regular polynomial endomorphism; i.e., one which extends\nholomorphically to CPn . The filled Julia set of F is the compact set\nKF = {z \u2208 Cn : F m (z) 6\u2192 \u221e as m \u2192 \u221e}.\nPluriharmonic measure \u03bcF on KF is F -invariant and of maximal entropy [FS95]. It\nis not difficult to construct examples where the Hausdorff dimension of the support\nof \u03bcF is any value up to and including 2n. In answer to a question posed in [FS01],\nwe prove:\nTheorem 1. The dimension of pluriharmonic measure on the filled Julia set of a\nregular polynomial endomorphism of Cn is at most 2n \u2212 1.\nIn [Oks81], Oksendal conjectured that the dimension of harmonic measure in\nC would never exceed 1, though the Hausdorff dimension of its support can take\nvalues up to and including 2. Makarov addressed this question for simply connected\ndomains, showing that the dimension of harmonic measure is always equal to one\n[Mak85]. The theorem was extended by Jones and Wolff, establishing that the\ndimension is no greater than 1 for general planar domains [JW88]. Moreover, Wolff\nDate: June 8, 2002.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 32H50; Secondary 32U99.\nThe first author is supported by N.S.F. Grant DMS-9970283.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nI. BINDER AND L. DEMARCO\n\nproved that there is always a set of full harmonic measure with \u03c3-finite Hausdorff\n1-measure [Wol93].\nThe complex structure on the plane plays a crucial role in the proof of these\ntheorems. Namely, one relies heavily on the subharmonicity of the function log |\u2207u|\nfor harmonic u.\nIt is also possible to take a dynamical approach to the dimension estimates. It\nfollows from results of Carleson, Jones, and Makarov ([CJ92] and [Mak89]) that\nany planar domain can be approximated in some sense by domains invariant under\nhyperbolic dynamical systems (the fractal approximation). In the special case of\nconformal Cantor sets, Carleson obtained dimension estimates using the dynamics\n[Car85]. Recently, it was shown that it suffices to consider polynomial Julia sets in\nthe fractal approximation [BJ02].\nHarmonic measure (evaluated at infinity) on the Julia set of a polynomial is the\nunique measure of maximal entropy [Bro65], [Lju83]. The estimate on dimension in\nthis case follows from a relation to the Lyapunov exponent and the entropy. Indeed,\nfor any polynomial map F on C, we have\n(1)\n\ndim \u03bcF =\n\nlog(deg F )\n,\nL(F )\n\nR\nwhere \u03bcF denotes harmonic measure on the Julia set of F and L(F ) = log |F \u2032 | d\u03bcF\nis the Lyapunov exponent [Mn88], [Man84]. The Lyapunov exponent of a polynomial\nis bounded below by log(deg F ) with equality if and only if the Julia set is connected\n[Prz85].\nOn the other hand, for harmonic measure in Rn , the methods applied to the study\nof dimension in C fail dramatically. The logarithm of the gradient of a harmonic\nfunction in Rn , n > 2, is not subharmonic, and there is no dynamical interpretation\nof harmonic measure. Furthermore, in [Wol95], Wolff showed that for each n > 2\nthere exists a domain in Rn with the dimension of harmonic measure strictly greater\nthan n \u2212 1. A result of Bourgain, however, gives an upper bound on the dimension\nof harmonic measure in the form n \u2212 \u03b5(n) [Bou87].\nn\u22122\nBecause of the harmonicity of |\u2207u| n\u22121 for a harmonic function u in Rn (see\n[Ste70]), it is conjectured that the dimension of harmonic measure in Rn does not\nexceed n \u2212 1 + n\u22122\nn\u22121 .\nFor pluriharmonic measure in Cn , both of the observations which led to proofs\nof the Oksendal conjecture in C are valid: the measure depends on the complex\nstructure of Cn and is the measure of maximal entropy for polynomial dynamics.\nTheorem 1 should be the first step in the proof of the following conjecture:\nConjecture 1. The dimension of pluriharmonic measure of domains in Cn is at\nmost 2n \u2212 1.\nThe example of area measure on the unit sphere in Cn shows that this estimate is\nsharp.\nWe believe also that one can give a precise formula for the dimension of pluriharmonic measure in the dynamical case, just as in dimension one (see formula\n\n\fDIMENSION OF PLURIHARMONIC MEASURE\n\n3\n\n(1) above). For a diffeomorphism of a real compact manifold, such a formula was\nobtained by Ledrappier and Young in [LY85]:\nX hi (\u03bc)\ndim \u03bc =\n(2)\n,\n\u03bbi (\u03bc)\n\nwhere \u03bc is an ergodic invariant measure without zero Lyapunov exponents, \u03bbi (\u03bc)\nare its positive Lyapunov exponents, and hi (\u03bc) are the corresponding directional entropies (defined in [LY85]). A similar formula was established by Bedford, Lyubich,\nand Smillie for polynomial diffeomorphisms of C2 [BLS93]. We make the following\nconjecture, which would imply Theorem 1.\nConjecture 2. For any holomorphic F : CPn \u2192 CPn of (algebraic) degree d > 1,\ndim \u03bcF = log d\n\nn\nX\n1\n,\n\u03bbi\ni=1\n\nwhere \u03bbi , i = 1 . . . n are the Lyapunov exponents of F with respect to \u03bcF repeated\nwith multiplicities.\nSketch proof of Theorem 1. We rely on estimates on the Lyapunov exponents\nof F with respect to \u03bcF . In particular, Briend and Duval showed that the minimal\nLyapunov exponent \u03bbmin is bounded below by 12 log d (where d is the degree of F )\n[BD99]. Bedford and Jonsson proved that the sum \u039b of the Lyapunov exponents\nn\u22121\nsatisfies \u039b \u2265 n+1\n2 log d [BJ00]. Combining these, we have \u039b \u2265 \u03bb0 + 2 log d, where\n\u03bb0 = max{\u03bbmax , log d}.\nWe define an invariant set Y of full measure so that preimages of small balls\ncentered at points in Y scale in a way governed by the Lyapunov exponents. Namely,\nfor each point y \u2208 Y there exists an infinite set My \u2282 Z such that if m \u2208 My then\nthe m-th preimage of a ball of radius r centered at F m (y) should contain a ball of\nradius \u2248 re\u2212m\u03bbmax around y. In addition, the component of the preimage containing\ny will have volume \u2248 r 2n e\u22122m\u039b . The details of the construction are very similar to\nthe methods of [BD99].\nLet Am = {y \u2208 Y : m \u2208 My }. Note that Y = \u2229k \u222am\u2265k Am . If we cover Y by\nN balls of radius r, then the \"good\" (as described above) m-th preimages define\na cover of Am by at most N dmn regions of controlled shape. Their union contains\nan re\u2212m\u03bbmax -neighborhood of Am , and has volume \u2264 N r 2n dm e2m(n\u22121)\u03bb0 , by the\nestimates above.\nFinally, a standard connection between the rate of decay of volume of a neighborhood of Y and its dimension allows us to conclude that dim Y \u2264 2n \u2212 1.\n\n2. Pluriharmonic measure in Cn and dynamics\nIn this section, we give some of the necessary background on pluripotential theory\nin Cn and its relation to polynomial dynamics. More details can be found in [Kli91],\n[BT87] and [Bed93].\n\n\f4\n\nI. BINDER AND L. DEMARCO\n\nLet PSH(Cn ) denote the class of plurisubharmonic functions in Cn . For a compact\nset K in Cn , the pluricomplex Green's function with pole at infinity is defined as\nGK (z) = sup {v(z) : v \u2208 PSH(Cn ), v \u2264 0 on K, v(z) \u2264 log kzk + O(1) near \u221e} .\nSee, for example, [Kli91] or [Bed93]. If GK is continuous, the set K is said to be\nregular.\nIn contrast to the one dimensional setting, GK is not necessarily pluriharmonic (or\neven harmonic) outside of K. It is, however, maximal plurisubharmonic, meaning\nthat if v is any plurisubharmonic function on a domain \u03a9 compactly contained in\nCn \u2212 K with v \u2264 GK on \u2202\u03a9, then v \u2264 GK on \u03a9. Equivalently, the Monge-Ampere\nmass of GK ,\n\u03bcK = (ddc GK )n ,\nvanishes in Cn \u2212 K. We call the measure \u03bcK the pluriharmonic measure on K, and\nnote that it is supported in the Shilov boundary of K. In fact, if K is regular, then\nits support is equal to the Shilov boundary [BT87].\nPluriharmonic measure arises in the study of dynamics just as in the one dimensional setting. A polynomial endomorphism F : Cn \u2192 Cn is called regular if it can\nbe extended holomorphically to CPn . The degree of F is the degree of its polynomial coordinate functions. We consider only those F of degree > 1. The escape rate\nfunction of F is defined by\n1\nlog+ kF m (z)k,\nm\u2192\u221e dm\n\nGF (z) = lim\n\nwhere d is the degree of F and log+ = max{log, 0}. The function GF is continuous\nand agrees with the pluricomplex Green's function for the filled Julia set KF = {z \u2208\nCn : F m (z) 6\u2192 \u221e}. Fornaess and Sibony showed that the pluriharmonic measure\n\u03bcF on KF is ergodic for F and a measure of maximal entropy [FS95].\nBy the Oseledec Ergodic Theorem, F has n Lyapunov exponents \u03bbmin \u2264 * * * \u2264\n\u03bbmax almost everywhere with respect to \u03bcF [Ose68]. We will only need the existence\nof the minimal, maximal, and the sum \u039b of the Lyapunov exponents, which we can\ndefine as follows:\nZ\n1\nlog k(DF m )\u22121 k d\u03bcF ,\n\u03bbmin = \u2212 lim\nm\u2192\u221e m\nZ\n1\n\u03bbmax = lim\nlog kDF m k d\u03bcF , and\nm\u2192\u221e m\nZ\n\u039b =\nlog | det DF | d\u03bcF .\nBriend and Duval proved that the Lyapunov exponents are all positive [BD99]; they\nshow\n(3)\n\n\u03bbmin \u2265\n\n1\nlog d,\n2\n\n\fDIMENSION OF PLURIHARMONIC MEASURE\n\n5\n\nwhere d is the degree of F . Bedford and Jonsson studied the sum of the Lyapunov\nexponents, and demonstrate that ([BJ00])\nn+1\n\u039b\u2265\n(4)\nlog d.\n2\nFor the proof of Theorem 1, it is convenient to work in the natural\nextension\nS\n(X\u0302, F ) where F is invertible (see [CFS82] and [BD99]). Let P (F ) = m\u22650 F m (C(F ))\nS\nbe the postcritical set of F and set X = Cn \u2212 m\u22650 F \u2212m (P (F )). The space (X\u0302, F )\nis the set of all bi-infinite sequences\n\u221e\nY\nX : F (xi ) = xi+1 }.\n{x\u0302 = (* * * x\u22121 x0 x1 * * * ) \u2208\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThe map F acts on (X\u0302, F ) by the left shift. We define projections \u03c0i : (X\u0302, F ) \u2192 X\nfor all i by \u03c0i (x\u0302) = xi . Since \u03bcF does not charge the critical locus of F , we have\n\u03bcF (X) = 1. The measure \u03bcF lifts to a unique F -invariant probability measure \u03bc\u0302 on\n(X\u0302, F ) so that \u03c00\u2217 \u03bc\u0302 = \u03bcF .\n3. Proof of the main theorem.\nIn this section we give a proof of the following theorem which clearly implies\nTheorem 1.\nTheorem 2. Pluriharmonic measure \u03bcF on the filled Julia set of a degree d regular\npolynomial endomorphism F : Cn \u2192 Cn satisfies\nlog d\n,\ndim \u03bcF \u2264 2n \u2212 2 +\nmax{log d, \u03bbmax }\nwhere \u03bbmax is the largest Lyapunov exponent of F with respect to \u03bcF .\nWe begin with a classical lemma. Statements (a) and (c) are exactly as in [BD99,\nLemma 2]. We first observe that there exists a constant C(n) so that for any n \u00d7 n\nmatrix A with kA \u2212 Ik < 1, we have\n(5)\n\n|det A \u2212 1| \u2264\n\nC(n)\nkA \u2212 Ik .\n2\n\nLemma 1.
