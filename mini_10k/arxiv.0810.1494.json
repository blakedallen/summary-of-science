INTRODUCTION\n\nSince the experimental discovery of an unusual halfinteger quantum Hall effect (QHE) [1, 2] in monolayer graphene, the electronic transport properties of\ngraphene related materials have been extensively studied [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Recently, bilayer\ngraphene is found to show an anomalous behavior in its\nspectral and transport properties, which has attracted\nmuch experimental and theoretical interest. Theoretical\nstudies [4, 5] show that interlayer coupling modifies the\nintralayer relativistic spectrum to yield a quasiparticle\nspectrum with a parabolic energy dispersion, which implies that the quasiparticles in bilayer graphene cannot\nbe treated as massless but have a finite mass. Experiments have shown that bilayer graphene exhibits an unconventional integer QHE [6]. The Landau level (LL)\nquantization results in plateaus of Hall conductivity at\ninteger positions proportional to the valley degeneracy,\nbut the plateau at zero energy is markedly absent. The\nunconventional QHE behavior derives from the coupling\nbetween the two graphene layers. The quasiparticles in\nbilayer graphene are chiral and carry a Berry phase 2\u03c0,\nwhich strongly affects their quantum dynamics. However, a detailed theoretical understanding of the unconventional properties of the QHE in bilayer graphene taking into account of the full band structure and disorder effect is still lacking. As established for a single\nlayer graphene [13] and conventional quantum Hall systems [14], the QHE phase diagram in such a system is\ncrucially depending on the topological properties of the\nfull energy band, and thus can be naturally determined\nin the band model calculations.\n\nIn this work, we carry out a numerical study of the\nQHE in bilayer graphene in the presence of disorder\nbased upon a tight-binding model. We reveal that the\nexperimentally observed unconventional QHE plateaus\nemerge near the band center, while the conventional QHE\nplateaus appear near the band edges. The unconventional ones are found to be much more stable to disorder scattering than the conventional ones near the band\nedges. We further investigate the quantum phase transition and obtain the phase boundaries Wc for different\nQHE states to insulator transition by calculating the\nThouless number [15]. Our results show that the unconventional QHE plateaus can be destroyed at strong\ndisorder (or weak magnetic field) through the float-up\nof extended levels toward the band center and higher\nplateaus always disappear first. While the \u03bd = \u00b12 QHE\nstates are most stable, the Dirac point at the band center\nseparating these two QHE states remains critical with a\nnearly constant longitudinal conductance.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the model Hamiltonian. In Sec. III, numerical\nresults based on exact diagonalization and transport calculations are presented. The final section contains a summary.\n\nII. THE TIGHT-BINDING MODEL OF BILAYER\nGRAPHENE\n\nWe consider the bilayer graphene composed of two coupled hexagonal lattice including inequivalent sublattices\ne B\ne on the top layer.\nA, B on the bottom layer and A,\nThe two layers are arranged in the AB (Bernal) stacking [16, 17], as shown in Fig. 1, where B atoms are lo-\n\n\f2\nP\n\u03c6 = 7 aij = 2\u03c0\nM , with M an integer. The total flux\n\u03c6\n, where N = Lx Ly /M is taken\nthrough the sample is N 2\u03c0\nto be an integer. When M is commensurate with Lx or\nLy , the magnetic periodic boundary conditions are reduced to the ordinary periodic boundary conditions.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Schematic of bilayer graphene lattice\nwith AB (Bernal) stacking. Bonds in the bottom layer (A,\ne B)\ne by\nB) are indicated by solid lines and in the top layer (A,\ndash lines. A unit cell contains four atoms: A (white circles),\ne (gray), AB\ne dimer (solid).\nB\n\ne atoms, and A atoms are the cencated directly below A\nters of the hexagons in the other layer. The unit cell\ne and B,\ne and the Brillouin\ncontains four atoms A, B, A,\nzone is identical with that of monolayer graphene. Here,\nthe in-plane nearest-neighbor hopping integral between\ne and B\ne atoms is denoted\nA and B atoms or between A\nby \u03b3AB = \u03b3AeBe = \u03b30 . For the interlayer coupling, we\ntake into account the largest hopping integral between B\ne atoms \u03b3\nand A\ne = \u03b31 , and the smaller hopping integral\nAB\ne atoms \u03b3\nbetween A and B\ne = \u03b33 . The values of these\nAB\nhopping integrals are estimated to be \u03b30 = 3.16 eV [18],\n\u03b31 = 0.39 eV [19], and \u03b33 = 0.315 eV [20].\nWe assume that each monolayer graphene has totally\nLy zigzag chains with Lx atomic sites on each chain [13].\nThe size of the sample will be denoted as N = Lx \u00d7 Ly \u00d7\nLz , where Lz = 2 is the number of monolayer graphene\nplanes along the z direction. In the presence of an applied\nmagnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the bilayer\ngraphene, the lattice model in real space can be written\nin the tight-binding form:\nX\nX\nciAe\neiaij c\u2020jB e\nc\u2020i e\ncj ) + (\u2212\u03b31\neiaij (c\u2020i cj + e\nH = \u2212\u03b30\nhiji\n\n\u2212 \u03b33\n\nX\n\nhiji3\n\ncj Be\neiaij c\u2020iA e\n\n+ h.c.) +\n\nX\ni\n\nhiji1\n\nwi (c\u2020i ci + e\nc\u2020i e\nci ),(1)\n\nwhere c\u2020i (c\u2020iA ), c\u2020j (c\u2020jB ) are creating operators on A and\nB sublattices in the bottom layer, and e\nc\u2020i (e\nc\u2020 ), e\nc\u2020j (e\nc\u2020 )\ne\ne\niA\njB\ne and B\ne sublattices in the top\nare creating operators\non\nA\nP\nintralayer nearestlayer.

The magnetic flux per hexagon\n\nThe eigenstates |\u03b1i and eigenenergies \u01eb\u03b1 of the system are obtained through exact diagonalization of the\nHamiltonian Eq. (1), and the Hall conductivity \u03c3xy is\ncalculated by using the Kubo formula\n\u03c3xy =\n\nie2 h\u0304 X h\u03b1 | Vx | \u03b2ih\u03b2 | Vy | \u03b1i \u2212 h.c.\n,\nS\n(\u01eb\u03b1 \u2212 \u01eb\u03b2 )2\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\nwhere S is the area of the sample, Vx and Vy are the\nvelocity operators. In Fig. 2a, the Hall conductivity \u03c3xy\nand electron density of states are plotted as functions of\nelectron Fermi energy Ef for a clean sample (W = 0) at\nsystem size N = 96 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 2 with magnetic flux \u03c6 = 2\u03c0\n48 ,\nwhich illustrates the overall picture of the QHE in the\nfull energy band. From the electron density of states,\nwe can see the discrete LLs. We will call central LL at\nEf = 0 the n = 0 LL, the one just above (below) it\nthe n = 1 (n = \u22121) LL, and so on. According to the\nbehavior of \u03c3xy , the energy band is naturally divided\ninto three different regimes. Around the band center,\n2\nthe Hall conductivity is quantized as \u03c3xy = \u03bd eh , where\n\u03bd = kgs with k an integer and gs = 2 for each LL due to\ndouble-valley degeneracy [4, 13] (the spin degeneracy will\ncontribute an additional factor 2, which is omitted here).\nWith each additional LL being occupied, the total Hall\n2\nconductivity is increased by gs eh . This is an invariant\nas long as the states between the n-th and (n \u2212 1)-th\nLL are localized. \u03c3xy = 0 at the particle-hole symmetric\npoint Ef = 0, which corresponds to the half-filling of\nthe central LL. However, there is no \u03c3xy = 0 quantized\nHall plateau. These anomalously quantized Hall plateaus\nagree with the results observed experimentally in bilayer\ngraphene [6].\nThe Hall conductivity near the band edges, however, is\n2\nquantized as \u03c3xy = k eh with k an integer, as in the conventional QHE systems. Remarkably, around Ef = \u00b1\u03b30\n(within a narrow energy region \u2206E \u223c 0.4\u03b30 ), there are\ntwo critical regions which separate the unconventional\nand conventional QHE states, where the Hall conductance quantization is lost. These crossover regions also\ncorrespond to a novel transport regime, where the Hall\nresistance changes sign and the longitudinal conductivity exhibits metallic behavior. The singular behavior of\nthe Hall conductivity in the crossover regions is likely to\noriginate from the Van Hove singularity in the electron\ndensity of states at B = 0 limit.

In Fig. 3, the\nHall conductivity around the band center is shown as\na function of Ef for four different disorder strengths at\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Calculated Hall conductivity with\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n, 192\nand 288\nfor four different\nweaker magnetic flux \u03c6 = 2\u03c0\n96\ndisorder strengths each averaged over 400 disorder configurations. Here, the sample size is N = 96 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 2.\n\nsystem size N = 96 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 2 with magnetic flux \u03c6 = 2\u03c0\n48 .\nWe can see that the plateaus with \u03bd = \u00b110, \u00b16 and \u00b12\nremain well quantized at W = 0.5. We mention that the\n\u03bd = \u00b14, \u00b18 plateaus are unclear at this relatively weak\ndisorder strength because of very small plateau widths\nand relatively large localization lengths (the critical Wc\nfor each plateau will be obtained based on our larger size\ncalculations of the Thouless number as presented later).\nWith increasing W , higher Hall plateaus (with larger |\u03bd|)\nare destroyed first. At W = 2.0, only the \u03bd = \u00b12 QHE\nremain robust. The last two plateaus \u03bd = \u00b12 eventually\ndisappear around W \u223c 3.2. For comparison, the QHE\nnear the lower band edge is shown in the inset, where all\nplateaus disappear at a much weaker disorder strength\nW \u2265 1.0. This clearly indicates that under the same conditions, the unconventional QHE around the band center\nis much more stable than the conventional QHE near the\nband edges. Clearly, after the destruction of the conventional QHE states near the band edge, these states\nbecome localized. Then the topological Chern numbers\ninitially carried by these states will move towards band\ncenter in a similar manner to the single-layer graphene\ncase [13]. Thus we observe that the destruction of the\nunconventional QHE states near the band center is due\nto the float-up of extended levels.\nTo study the fate of the IQHE at weak magnetic\nfield limit, we reduce the strength of magnetic field. In\nFig. 4, the Hall conductivities around the band center\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\nwith weaker magnetic flux \u03c6 = 2\u03c0\n96 , 192 and 288 are\nshown for different disorder strengths and system size\nN = 96 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 2. In Fig. 4a, a lot more well quantized\nHall plateaus emerge for a clean sample(W = 0), if we\ncompare them with the results in Fig. 2b. In Fig. 4b, 4c\nand 4d, we can see that with the increasing of the dis-\n\n\f4\n\ng=\n\n\u2206E\n.\ndE/dN\n\nHere, \u2206E is the geometric mean of the shift in the energy levels of the system caused by replacing periodic\nby antiperiodic boundary conditions, and dE/dN is the\nmean spacing of the energy levels. The Thouless number\ng is proportional to the longitudinal conductance G. In\nFig. 5, we show some examples of calculated Thouless\nnumber for a relatively weak flux \u03c6 = 2\u03c0\n48 and some different disorder strengths to explain how quantum phase\ntransitions and the related phase boundaries Wc are determined. In Fig. 5a, the calculated Thouless number g\nand Hall conductivity \u03c3xy as a function of Ef at a weak\ndisorder strength W = 0.2 are plotted. Clearly, each\nvalley in Thouless number corresponds to a Hall plateau\nand each peak corresponds to a critical point between\ntwo neighboring Hall plateaus. We can also call the first\nvalley just above (below) Ef = 0 the \u03bd = \u22122 (\u03bd = 2)\nQHE state, the second one the \u03bd = \u22124 (\u03bd = 4) state,\nand so on, as same as the Hall plateaus. In Fig. 5b-5d,\nwe see that with increasing W , higher QHE states (valleys) are destroyed first. At W = Wc = 1.0 (see Fig. 5b),\nthe valleys with \u03bd = \u00b112 disappear, which correspond\nto the destruction of the \u03bd = \u00b112 Hall plateau states.\nTherefore, Wc = 1.0 is the critical disorder strength, at\nwhich the \u03bd = \u00b112 plateau states change to an insulating phase. At W = Wc = 1.3 (see Fig. 5c), the valleys\nwith \u03bd = \u00b18 disappear, which indicates the destruction\nof the \u03bd = \u00b18 QHE states and their transition into the\ninsulating phase. When W = Wc = 3.2 (see Fig. 5d), the\nmost stable QHE states with \u03bd = \u00b12 eventually disappear, which indicates all QHE phases are destroyed by\ndisorder. All the phase boundaries Wc between the different QHE states are determined in the same manner\nand tabulated in Table 1.\n\n0.15\n\n0.15\n\n12\n\n(a)\n\nThouless number\n\n10\n8\n\n(b)\n\nw=0.2\n\nw=1.0\n-8\n\n8\n\n6\n\n0.10\n\nxy\n\n0.10\n\n4\n\nxy\n\n10\n\n4\n\n-4\n\n-10\n\n-4\n-6\n\n0.05\n\n0.05\n\n-8\n-10\n-12\n0.00\n-0.8\n\n6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n-6\n\n-2\n\n2\n\n0.00\n-0.6\n\n0.15\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0.15\n\n(c)\nThouless number\n\norder strength W , Hall plateaus are destroyed faster for\nthe system with weaker magnetic flux \u03c6.

However, the topology of the QHE and how they\ndisappear with the increase of the disorder strength W\nremain to be the same as the stronger B cases as demonstrated in Fig. 4a-4d. Thus, we establish that the obtained behavior of QHE for bilayer graphene will survive\nat weak B limit.\nWe further investigate the quantum phase transition\nof the bilayer graphene electron system.

We can see that the Thouless number shows\na central peak at Ef = 0. With increasing the disorder\nstrength, the width of the peak increases and its height\nremains nearly unchanged. This behavior may suggest\nan interesting effect that the extended states originally\nsited at the critical point Ef = 0 splits in the presence\nof disorder. However, the splitting is too small to induce two separated peaks in the Thouless number for the\npresent sample sizes we can approach. Instead, it leads\nto a widened peak of unreduced height. This behavior\nalso indicates that the critical longitudinal conductance\nin a small finite region near Ef = 0 is almost constant\nabout 2e2 /h according to the proportionality of Thouless number to longitudinal conductance. We have also\nconfirmed this conclusion by direct Kubo formula calculation, in which the system size that can be approached\nis however much smaller.\nHall plateaus index critical point Wc\n\u03bd = \u00b112\n1.0\n\u03bd = \u00b110\n1.2\u00b10.1\n\u03bd = \u00b18\n1.3\u00b10.1\n\u03bd = \u00b16\n1.6\u00b10.1\n\u03bd = \u00b14\n1.7\u00b10.1\n\u03bd = \u00b12\n3.2\nTABLE I: The phase boundaries Wc for the different Hall\nplateaus.\n\n\f5\nthus one will not be able to see the important physics of\nopposite Chern numbers annihilating each other to destroy the IQHE[13].\n\n0.10\n\nw=0.4\nw=0.8\nw=1.5\n\n0.08\n\nthouless number\n\nw=2.0\n\n0.06\n\n0.04\n\n0.02\n\n0.00\n-0.4\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nNormalized Fermi Energy E /\nF\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0\n\nFIG. 6: (Color online) (a) Thouless number for five different\ndisorder strength, each point being averaged over 400 disorder\nand the sample size is N =\nconfigurations.

SUMMARY\n\nIn summary, we have numerically investigated the\nQHE in bilayer graphene based on tight-binding model\nin the presence of disorder. The experimentally observed unconventional QHE is reproduced near the band\ncenter. The unconventional QHE plateaus around the\nband center are found to be much more stable than the\nconventional ones near the band edges. Our results of\nquantum phase transition indicate that with increasing\ndisorder strength, the Hall plateaus can be destroyed\nthrough the float-up of extended levels toward the band\ncenter and higher plateaus always disappear first. At\nW = Wc = 3.2, the most stable QHE states with \u03bd = \u00b12\neventually disappear, which indicates transition of all\nQHE phases into the insulating phase. A small critical region is observed between the \u03bd = \u00b12 plateaus,\nwhere the longitudinal conductance remains almost constant about 2e2 /h in the presence of moderate disorder,\npossibly due to the splitting of the critical point originally sited at Ef = 0. We mention that in our numerical\ncalculations, the magnetic field is much stronger than\nthe ones one can realize in the experimental situation, as\nlimited by current computational ability. However, the\nphase diagram we obtained is robust and applicable to\nweak field limit since it is determined by the topological property of the energy band as clearly established for\nsingle layer graphene [13] and conventional quantum Hall\nsystems [14]. We further point out that the continuum\nmodel can not be used to address the fate of the quantum Hall effect in strong disorder or weak magnetic field\nlimit. Because in such a model, both the band bottom\nand band edge are pushed to infinite energy limit, and\n\nAcknowledgment: This work is supported by the\nUS DOE grant DE-FG02-06ER46305 (RS, DNS) and\nthe NSF grant DMR-0605696 (RM, DNS).
