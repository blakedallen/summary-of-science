The\nmain theoretical efforts are presently focused on calculation of templates of the gravitational waves emitted by coalescing binary\nsystems comprised of neutron stars and/or black holes [12\u201317] as well as creation of improved filtering technique for gravitational\nwave detectors [18, 19] which will enable the extraction of the gravitational wave signal from all kind of interferences present\nin the noisy data collected by the gravitational wave observatories . Direct experimental efforts have led to the construction of\nseveral ground-based optical interferometers with the length of arms reaching a few miles [20\u201324]. Certain work is under way\nto build super-sensitive cryogenic-bar gravitational-wave detectors of Weber's type [25\u201328]. Spaceborne laser interferometric\ndetectors like LISA [29], NGO [30] or ASTROD [31, 32] may significantly increase the sensitivity of the gravitational-wave\ndetectors and revolutionize the field of gravitational physics.\nThere is no doubt, the detection of gravitational waves by the specialized gravitational wave antennas would provide the\nmost direct evidence of the existence of these elusive ripples in the fabric of spacetime. On the other hand, there exist a\nnumber of astronomical phenomena which might be used for an indirect detection of gravitational waves and understanding\ngravitational physics of astrophysical systems emitting gravitational waves. It is worth emphasizing that the present-day groundbased gravitational wave detectors are sensitive to a rather narrow band of the gravitational wave spectrum ranging between\n1000\u00f71 Hz [33, 34]. Spaceborne gravitational wave detectors may bring the sensitivity band down to 1 mHz [30, 32]. In order\nto explore the ultra-long gravitational wave phenomena much below 1 mHz we have to rely upon other astronomical techniques\nfor example, pulsar timing [35, 36] or radiometry of polarization of cosmic microwave background radiation [37, 38]. The short\ngravitational waves can be generated by coalescing binary systems of compact astrophysical objects like neutron stars and/or\nblack holes [39\u201342]. The ultra-long gravitational waves can be generated by localized gravitational sources and/or topological\ndefects in the early universe [43\u201347].\nAstronomical observations are conducted with electromagnetic waves (photons) of different frequencies over the spectrum\nspreading from very long radio waves to gamma rays. Therefore, in order to detect the effects of the gravitational waves\nby astronomical technique one has to solve the problem of propagation of electromagnetic waves through the field generated\nby a localized gravitationally-bounded distribution of masses which motion is determined by general relativity. Notice that\ngravitational wave detectors are optical interferometers making use of light propagation. Therefore, correct understanding\nof the process of physical interaction of the laser beam of the interferometer with incoming gravitational waves is important\nfor their unambiguous recognition and detection. Equations of propagation of electromagnetic signals must be derived in the\nframework of the same theory of gravity in order to keep description of gravitational and electromagnetic phenomena on the\nsame theoretical ground. We draw attention of the reader that the parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism [48] does not\ncomply with this requirement. The PPN formalism is constructed on the ground of plausible physical hypothesis and assumptions\nabout alternatives to general relativity but it does not demand their overall conformity. Therefore, straightforward application\nof PPN formalism to discuss gravitational physics may eventually lead to incorrect results. As an example, we point out that\nPPN formalism does not produce the consistent post-Newtonian equations of motion of extended bodies even in a simplified\ncase of two PPN parameters, \u03b2 and \u03b3 , when more subtle effects of body's gravitational multipoles are taken into account [49].\nPPN formalism applied to interpret gravitational light-ray deflection experiments by major planets of the solar system [50\u201352]\ncreated a notable \"speed-of-light versus speed-of-gravity\" controversy [53] which originates in the inability of PPN formalism\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: kopeikins@missouri.edu; Corresponding author\n\n\f2\nto distinguish between physical effects of gravity and electromagnetism due to the non-covariant nature of PPN parametrization\nlimited merely by the metric manifolds [54, 55].\nIn the present chapter we rely upon the Einstein theory of general relativity and assume that light propagates in vacuum that\nis the interstellar medium has no impact on the speed of light propagation. General relativity is a geometrized theory of gravity\nand it assumes that both gravity and electromagnetic field propagate locally in vacuum with the same speed which is equal\nto the fundamental speed c in special theory of relativity [1]. Gravitational field is found as a solution of the Einstein field\nequations. The electromagnetic field is obtained by solving the Maxwell equations on the curved spacetime manifold derived at\nprevious step from Einstein's equations. In the approximation of geometric optics the electromagnetic signals propagate along\nnull geodesics of the metric tensor [1\u20133].\nThe problem of finding solutions of the null ray equations in curved spacetime attracted many researchers since the time\nof discovery of general relativity. Exact solutions of this problem were found in some, particularly simple cases of symmetric spacetimes like Schwarzschild's or Kerr's black hole, homogeneous and isotropic Friedman-Leme\u0131\u0302tre-Robertson-Walker\n(FLRW) cosmology, plane gravitational wave , etc. [1\u20133, 56]. For quite a long time these exact description of null geodesics was\nsufficient for the purposes of experimental gravitational physics. However, real physical spacetime has no symmetries and the\nsolution of such current problems as direct detection of gravitational waves, interpretation of an anisotropy and polarization of\ncosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR), exploration of inflationary models of the early universe, finding new experimental evidences in support of general relativity and quantum gravity, development of higher-precision relativistic algorithms\nfor space missions, and many others, can not fully rely upon the mathematical techniques developed mainly in the symmetric\nspacetimes. Especially important is to find out a method of integration of equations of light geodesics in spacetimes having\ntime-dependent gravitational perturbations of arbitrary multipole order.\nIn the present chapter we consider a case of an isolated astronomical system embedded to an asymptotically-flat spacetime.\nThis excludes Friedmann-Leme\u0131\u0302tre-Robertson-Walker spacetime which is not asymptotically-flat (see chapter ??). We assume\nthat gravitational field of this system is characterized by an infinite set of gravitational multipoles emitting gravitational waves.\nPrecise and coordinate-free mathematical definition of the asymptotic flatness is based on the concept of conformal infinity that\nwas worked out in a series of papers [57\u201362] and we recommend the textbook of R. Wald [3] for a concise but comprehensive\nmathematical introduction to this subject. The asymptotic flatness implies the existence of a comformal compactification of\nthe manifold but it may not exist for a particular case of an astrophysical system. There is also coordinate-free definition of\ngravitational multipoles of an isolated system given by Hansen [63]. However, they make sense only in stationary spacetimes\nbut are not applicable for time-dependent gravitational fields which make them useless for practical analysis of real astronomical\nobservations and for interpretation of relativistic effects in propagation of electromagnetic signals. We use neither Hansen's\nmultipoles in the present chapter nor the comformal compactification technique. Moreover, because observable effects of gravitational waves are weak we shall consider only linear effects of gravitational multipoles so that relativistic effects produced by\nnon-linearity of the gravitational field will be ignored. The linearized approximation of general theory of relativity represents a\nstraightforward and practically useful approach to description of the multipole structure of the gravitational field of a localized\nastronomical system. The multipolar gravitational formalism was developed by several scientists, most notably by Kip Thorne\n[5] and Blanchet & Damour [64\u201368], and we use their results in the present chapter.\nExact formulation of the problem under discussion in this chapter is as follows (see Fig 1). We assume (in a less restrictive\nsense than the comformal compactification technique does) that spacetime under consideration is asymptotically flat and covered\nglobally by a single coordinate chart, x\u03b1 = (ct, x), where t is coordinate time and x are spatial coordinates. An electromagnetic\nwave (photon) is emitted by a source of light at time t0 at point x0 towards an observer which receives the photon at the instant\nof time t and at the point x. Photon propagates through the time-dependent gravitational field of the isolated astronomical\nsystem emitting gravitational waves. The structure of the gravitational field is described by a set of Blanchet-Damour multipole\nmoments of the system which are functions of the retarded time t \u2212 r/c, where r is the distance from the isolated system to the\nfield point and c is the fundamental speed. The retardation is physically due to the finite speed of gravity which coincides in\ngeneral relativity with the speed of light in vacuum. Some confusion may arise in the interpretation of the observational effects\nbecause both gravity and light propagates in general relativity with the same speed. The discrimination between various effects\nis still possible because gravity and light propagate to observer from different sources and along different spatial directions\n(characteristics of the null cone in spacetime) [54].\nOur task is to find out the relations connecting various physical parameters (direction of propagation, frequency, polarization,\nintensity, etc.) of the electromagnetic signal at the point of emission with those measured by the observer. Gravitational field\naffects propagation of the electromagnetic signal and changes its parameters along the light ray. Observing these changes\nallow us to study various properties of the gravitational field of the astronomical system and to detect gravitational waves with\nastronomical technique. The rest of the chapter is devoted to the mathematical solution of this problem.\n\n\f3\n\nI\n\n+\n\nJ+\n\n(t,x)\n\nJ+\n\nR\n\nI\n\n0\n\nI\n\n0\n\n(t0 ,x0 )\n\nQ\n\nk\n\nJ\n\n\u2212\n\nJ\nk\n\n\u2212\n\nP\n\nI\n\n\u2212\n\nFIG. 1: The Penrose diagram shows a worldline of the isolated system (binary star) originating at past timelike infinity I \u2212 and ending at the\nfuture timelike infinity I + . Both light and gravity propagate along null geodesics going from the past null infinity J \u2212 to the future null infinity\nJ + . A particular light geodesic is emanating from the event (t0 , x0 ) and ending at the event (t, x). Extrapolation of this light geodesic to the\npast null infinity defines the null wave vector k\u03b1 = (k0 , k) of the electromagnetic wave under consideration.\n\nB. Historical background\n\nPropagation of electromagnetic signals through stationary gravitational field is a rather well-known subject having been originally discussed in classic textbooks by [69, 70]. Presently, almost any standard textbook on relativity describes solution of\nthe null geodesic equations in the field of a spherically-symmetric and rotating body or black hole. This solution is practical\nsince it is used, for example, for interpretation of gravitational measurements and light-propagation experiments in the solar\nsystem [54]. Another application is gravitational lensing in our galaxy and in cosmology [71\u201373]. Continually growing accuracy of astronomical observations demands much better treatment of secondary effects in the propagation of light produced\nby the perturbations of the gravitational field associated with the higher-order gravitational multipoles of planets and Sun[74].\n\n\f4\nTime-dependent multipoles emit gravitational waves which perturb propagation of light with the characteristic period of the\ngravitational wave. Influence of these periodic perturbations on light propagation parameters is important for developing correct\nstrategy for understanding the principles of operation of gravitational wave detectors as well as for searching gravitational waves\nby astronomical techniques.\nAmong the most interesting sources of periodic gravitational waves with a well-predicted behaviour are binary systems comprised of two stars orbiting each other around a common barycenter (center of mass). Indirect evidence in support of existence of\ngravitational waves emitted by binary pulsars was given by Joe Taylor with collaborators [75, 76]. However, direct observation\nof gravitational waves remains a challenging problem for experimental gravitational physics. The expected spectrum of gravitational waves extends from \u223c 104 Hz to 10\u221218 Hz [33, 34]. Within that range, the spectrum of periodic waves from known binary\nsystems extends from about 10\u22123 Hz \u2013 the frequency of gravitational radiation from a contact white-dwarf binary [40], through\nthe 10\u22124 to 10\u22126 Hz \u2013 the range of radiation from the main-sequence binaries [41], to the 10\u22127 to 10\u22129 Hz \u2013 the frequencies\nemitted by binary supermassive black holes presumably lurking in active galactic nuclei (AGN) [42]. The dimensionless strain\nof these waves at the Earth, h, may be as great as 10\u221221 at the highest frequencies, and as great as 3 \u00d7 10\u221215 at the lowest\nfrequencies in the spectrum of gravitational waves [33, 34].\nSazhin [77] was the first who suggested the method of detection of gravitational waves emitted from a binary system by using\ntiming observations of a background pulsar, more distant than the binary lying on the line of sight which passes sufficiently\nclose in the sky to the binary. He had shown that the integrated time delay for the propagation of an electromagnetic pulse\nnear the binary is proportional to 1/d 2 where d is the impact parameter of the unperturbed trajectory of the signal. Similar idea\nwas independently proposed by Detweiler [78] who has focused on discussing an application of pulsar timing for detection of a\nstochastic cosmological background of gravitational waves. More recently, Sazhin & Saphonova [79] have made estimates of the\nprobability of observation of such an effect for pulsars in globular clusters and showed that the probability can be high, reaching\n97%. Sazhin-Detweiler idea is currently used in pulsar timing arrays to detect gravitational waves in nano-Hertz frequency band\n[80\u201382].\nWahlquist [83] proposed another approach to the detection of periodic gravitational waves based on Doppler tracking of\nspacecraft travelling in deep space. His approach is restricted by the plane gravitational wave approximation developed earlier\nby Estabrook & Wahlquist [84]. Tinto ([85], and references therein) made the most recent theoretical contribution in this\nresearch area. The Doppler tracking technique is used in deep space missions for detection of gravitational waves by seeking for\nthe characteristic triple signature in the continuously recorded phase of radio waves in the radio link between the ground station\nand spacecraft. The presence of this specific signature would indicate to the influence of the Doppler signal by a gravitational\nwave crossing the line of sight from the spacecraft to observer [86, 87].\nBraginsky et al. [88, 89] raised a question about a possibility of using Very-Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) as a detector\nof stochastic gravitational waves produced in the early universe. This idea had been also investigated by Kaiser & Jaffe [90] and,\nthe most prominently, by Pyne et al. [91] and Gwinn et al. [92] who showed that the overall effect in the time delay of VLBI\nsignal is proportional to the strain of the metric perturbation, h, caused by the plane gravitational wave. They also calculated\nthe pattern of proper motions of quasars over all the sky as an indicator of the presence of quadrupole and high-order harmonics\nof ultra-long gravitational wave and set an observational limit on the energy density of such gravitational waves present in the\nearly universe. Montanari [93] studied the perturbations of polarization of electromagnetic radiation propagating in the field of\na plane gravitational wave and found that the effects are exceedingly small, unlikely to be observable.\nFakir ([94, 95], and references therein) has suggested to use astrometry to detect the periodic variations in apparent angular\nseparations of appropriate light sources, caused by gravitational waves emitted by isolated sources of gravitational radiation.\nHe was not able to develop a self-consistent approach to tackle the problem with a necessary completeness and rigour. For this\nreason, his estimate of the effect of the deflection of light caused by gravitational wave perturbation, is too optimistic. Another\nattempt to work out a more consistent approach to the calculation of the light deflection angle by the radiation field of an arbitrary\nsource of gravitational waves has been undertaken by Durrer [96]. However, the calculations have been done only for the plane\nwave approximation. Nonetheless, the result obtained was extrapolated to the case of the localized source of gravitational waves\nwithout convincing justification. For this reason the magnitude of the periodic changes of the light deflection angle was largely\noverestimated. The same misinterpretation of the effect of gravitational waves from localized sources can be found in the paper\nby Labeyrie [97] who studied a photometric modulation of background sources of light (stars) by gravitational waves emitted\nby fast-orbiting binary stars. Because of the erroneous predictions, the expected detection of gravitational waves from VLBI\nobservations of a radio source GPS QSO 2022+171 undertaken by Pogrebenko et al. [98] was not based on firm theoretical\nground and did not lead to success.\nDamour & Esposito-Far\u00e8se [99] have studied the deflection of light and integrated time delay caused by the time-dependent\ngravitational field generated by a localized astrophysical source lying in the sky close to the line of sight to a background source\nof light. They worked in a quadrupole approximation and explicitly calculated the effects of the retarded gravitational field\nof the astrophysical source in its near, intermediate, and wave zones by making use of the Fourier-decomposition technique.\nContrary to the claims of Fakir [94, 95] and Durrer [96] and in agreement with Sazhin's [77] calculations, they found that the\ncontribution of the wave-zone and intermediate-zone fields to the deflection angle vanish exactly due to some remarkable mutual\ncancellations of different components of the gravitational field. The leading, total time-dependent deflection of light is created\n\n\f5\nonly by the quasi-static, near-zone quadrupolar part of the gravitational field.\nDamour and Esposito-Farese [99] analyzed propagation of light under a simplifying condition that the impact parameter\nof the light ray is small with respect to the distances from observer and the source of light to the isolated system. We have\nfound [6, 100] another way around to solve the problem of propagation of electromagnetic waves in the quadrupolar field of\nthe gravitational waves emitted by the system without making any assumptions on mutual disposition of observer, source of\nlight, and the system, thus, significantly improving and extending the result of paper [99]. At the same time the paper [100]\ndid not answer the question about the impact of the other, higher-order gravitational multipoles of the isolated system on the\nprocess of propagation of electromagnetic signals. This might be important if the effective gravitational wave emission of an\noctupole and/or higher-order multipoles is equal or even exceeds that of the quadrupole as it may be in case of, for example,\nhighly-asymmetric stellar collapse [101], nearly head-on collision of two stars, or break-up of a binary system caused by a recoil\nof two black holes [102].\nIn the present chapter we work out a systematic approach to the problem of propagation of light rays in the field of arbitrary\ngravitational multipole. While the most papers on light propagation consider both a light source and an observer as being located\nat infinity we do not need these assumptions. For this reason, our approach is generic and applicable for any mutual configuration\nof the source of light and observer with respect to the source of gravitational radiation. The integration technique which we use\nfor finding solution of the equations of propagation of light rays was worked out in series of our papers [6, 100, 103, 104].\nThe metric tensor and coordinate systems involved in our calculations are described in section II along with gauge conditions\nimposed on the metric tensor. The equations of propagation of electromagnetic waves in the geometric optics approximation\nare discussed in section III and the method of their integration is given in section IV. Exact solution of the equations of light\npropagation and the exact form of relativistic perturbations of the light trajectory and the coordinate speed of light are obtained\nin section V. Section VI is devoted to the derivation of the primary observable relativistic effects - the integrated time delay,\nthe deflection angle, the frequency shift, and the rotation of the plane of polarization of an electromagnetic wave. We discuss in\nsections VII and VIII two limiting cases of the most interesting relative configurations of the source of light, the observer, and\nthe source of gravitational waves \u2013 the gravitational-lens configuration (section VII) and the case of a plane gravitational wave\n(section VIII).\n\nC.\n\nNotations and Conventions\n\nWe consider a spacetime manifold which is asymptotically flat at infinity [115]. Metric tensor of the spacetime manifold is\ndenoted by g\u03b1\u03b2 and its perturbation\nh\u03b1\u03b2 = g\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 .\n\n(1)\n\nThe determinant of the metric tensor is negative, and is denoted as g = det[g\u03b1\u03b2 ]. A four-dimensional, fully antisymmetric\nLevi-Civita symbol \u03b5\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b3\u03b4 is defined in accordance with the convention \u03b50123 = +1.\nIn the present chapter we use a geometrodynamic system of units [2] such that the fundamental speed, c, and the universal\ngravitational constant, G, are equal to unity, that is c = G = 1. spacetime is assumed to be globally covered by a Cartesianlike coordinate system (x\u03b1 ) \u2261 (x0 , x1 , x2 , x3 ) \u2261 (t, x, y, z) , where t and (x, y, z) are time and space coordinates respectively. This\ncoordinate system is reduced at infinity to the inertial Lorentz coordinates defined up to a global Lorentz-Poincare transformation\n[4]. Sometimes we shall use spherical coordinates (r, \u03b8 , \u03c6 ) related to (x, y, z) by a standard transformation\nx = r sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6 ,\n\ny = r sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 ,\n\nz = r cos \u03b8 .\n\n(2)\n\nSpatial coordinates (xi ) \u2261 (x, y, z) in some equations will be denoted with a boldface font, x \u2261 (xi ).\nWe shall operate with various geometric objects which have tensor indices. We agree that Greek (spacetime) indices \u03b1 , \u03b2 , \u03b3 , . . .\nrange from 0 to 3, and Latin (space) indices a, b, c, . . . run from 1 to 3. If not specifically stated the opposite, the Greek indices are\nraised and lowered by means of the Minkowski metric \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 diag(\u22121, 1, 1, 1), for example, A\u03b1 = \u03b5 \u03b1\u03b2 A\u03b2 , B\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03b5\u03b1 \u03bc \u03b5\u03b2 \u03bd B\u03bc\u03bd ,\nand so on. The spatial indices are raised and lowered with the help of the Kronecker symbol (a unit matrix), \u03b4i j \u2261 diag(1, 1, 1).\nRegarding this rule the following conventions for the Cartesian coordinates hold: xi = xi and x0 = \u2212x0 .\nRepeated indices are summed over in accordance with Einstein's rule [2], for example,\nA\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b3 B\u03b1 \u03bc \u2261 A0\u03b2 \u03b3 B0\u03bc + A1\u03b2 \u03b3 B1\u03bc + A2\u03b2 \u03b3 B2\u03bc + A3\u03b2 \u03b3 B3\u03bc .\n\n(3)\n\nIn the linearized (with respect to G) approximation of general relativity used in the present chapter, there is no difference\nbetween spatial vectors and co-vectors nor between upper and lower space indices. Therefore, we do not distinguish between\nthe superscript and subscript spatial indeses. For example, for a dot (scalar) product of two space vectors we have\nAi Bi = Ai Bi \u2261 A1 B1 + A2 B2 + A3 B3 .\n\n(4)\n\n\f6\nIn what follows, we shall commonly use the spatial multi-index notations for three-dimensional, Cartesian tensors [5] like this\nIAl \u2261 Ia1 ...al .\n\n(5)\n\nA tensor product of l identical spatial vectors ki will be denoted as a three-dimensional tensor having l indices\nka1 ka2 . . . kal \u2261 ka1 ...al .\n\n(6)\n\nFull symmetrization with respect to a group of spatial indices of a Cartesian tensor will be denoted with round brackets embracing\nthe indices\nQ(a1 ...al ) \u2261\n\n1\nQ\u03c3 (1)...\u03c3 (l) ,\nl! \u2211\n\u03c3\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03c3 is the set of all permutations of (1, 2, ..., l) which makes Qa1 ...al fully symmetric in a1 . . . al .\nIt is convenient to introduce a special notation for symmetric trace-free (STF) Cartesian tensors by making use of angular\nbrackets around STF indices.

For this reason, to avoid\nthe appearance of overcomplicated index notations we shall omit the angular brackets around the spatial indices of these (and\nonly these) Cartesian tensors, that is we adopt: IAl \u2261 I<Al > and SAl \u2261 S<Al > .\nWe shall also use transverse (T) and transverse-traceless (TT) Cartesian tensors in our calculations [2, 5, 64]. These objects\nare defined by making use of the operator of projection\nPjk \u2261 \u03b4 jk \u2212 k jk ,\n\n(15)\n\nonto the plane orthogonal to a unit vector k j . This operator plays a role of a Kroneker symbol in the two dimensional space in\nthe sense that Pi j Pjk = Pik , and Pii = 2.

We introduce a Heaviside step function , H(p \u2212 q), such that on the set\nof whole numbers\n(\n0, if p \u2264 q ,\nH(p \u2212 q) =\n(21)\n1, if p > q .\nPartial derivatives of any differentiable function, f = f (t, x), are denoted as follows: f,0 = \u2202 f /\u2202 t and f,i = \u2202 f /\u2202 xi . In general,\ncomma standing after a function denotes a partial derivative with respect to a corresponding coordinate: f ,\u03b1 \u2261 \u2202 f (x)/\u2202 x\u03b1 . A\ndot above function denotes a total derivative of the function with respect to time\nf \u0307 \u2261 d f /dt = \u2202 f /\u2202 t + \u1e8bi \u2202 f /\u2202 xi ,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere \u1e8bi denotes velocity along the integral curve xi = xi (t) parametrized with coordinate time t. In this chapter the integral\ncurves are light rays, and the derivatives \u1e8bi are taken along the light ray trajectory (xi ) = x(t). Sometimes the partial derivatives\nwith respect to space coordinate xi will be also denoted as \u2202i \u2261 \u2202 /\u2202 xi , and the partial time derivative will be denoted as \u2202t \u2261 \u2202 /\u2202 t.\nA covariant derivative with respect to the coordinate x\u03b1 will be denoted as \u2207\u03b1 .\nWe shall introduce and distinguish notations for integrals taken with respect to time at a fixed spatial point, from those taken\nalong a light-ray trajectory. Specifically, the time integrals from a function F(t, x), where x is a fixed point in space, are denoted\nas\nF (\u22121) (t, x) \u2261\n\nZt\n\nF(\u03c4 , x)d \u03c4 ,\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nF (\u22122) (t, x) \u2261\n\nZt\n\nF (\u22121) (\u03c4 , x)d \u03c4 .\n\n(23)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThe time integrals from a function F(t, x) taken on a light ray suggest that the spatial coordinate x is a function of time x \u2261 x(t),\ntaken along the light ray. These integrals are denoted as\nF [\u22121] (t, x) \u2261\n\nZt\n\nF(\u03c4 , x(\u03c4 ))d \u03c4 ,\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nF [\u22122] (t, x) \u2261\n\nZt\n\nF [\u22121] (\u03c4 , x(\u03c4 ))d \u03c4 ,\n\n(24)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere x \u2261 x(t) in the right side of these definitions. The integrals in (23) represent functions of time, t, and spatial, x,\ncoordinates. The integrals in (24) are functions of time, t, only.\nPartial time derivative of the order p from a function F(t, x) is denoted by\nF (p) (t, x) =\n\n\u2202 p F(t, x)\n,\n\u2202t p\n\n(25)\n\nso that its action on the time integrals eliminates integration in the sense that\nF (p) (t, x) =\n\n\u2202 p+1 F (\u22121) (t, x) \u2202 p+2 F (\u22122) (t, x)\n=\n.\n\u2202 t p+1\n\u2202 t p+2\n\n(26)\n\nTotal time derivative of the order p from a function F(t, x) is denoted by\nF [p] (t, x) =\n\nd p F(t, x)\n.\ndt p\n\n(27)\n\n\f8\nThe reader can easily confirm that\nd p+1 F [\u22121] (t, x) d p+2 F [\u22122] (t, x)\n=\n.\n(28)\ndt p+1\ndt p+2\nIn what follows, we shall denote spatial vectors by the bold italic letters, for instance, Ai \u2261 A, ki \u2261 k, etc. The Euclidean\ndot product between two spatial vectors, for example a and b, is denoted with a dot between them: ai bi = a * b. The Euclidean\nwedge (cross) product between two spatial vectors is denoted with a symbol \u00d7, that is \u03b5i jk a j bk = (a \u00d7 b)i . Other particular\nnotations will be introduced as soon as they appear in text.\nF [p] (t, x) =\n\nII.\n\nTHE METRIC TENSOR, GAUGES AND COORDINATES\nA. The canonical form of the metric tensor perturbation\n\nWe consider an isolated astronomical system emitting gravitational waves and assume that gravitational field is weak everywhere so that the metric tensor can be expanded in a Taylor series with respect to the powers of gravitational constant G which\nlabels the order of products of the metric tensor perturbations that are kept in the solution of the Einstein equations. We shall\nconsider only a linearised post-Minkowskian approximation of general relativity and discard all terms of the order of G2 and\nhigher. The metric tensor is a linear combination of the Minkowski metric, \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 , and a small perturbation h\u03b1\u03b2\ng\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 + Gh\u03b1\u03b2 + O(G2 ) ,\ng\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\n= \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 Gh\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\n(1)\n\n2\n\n+ O(G ) ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere h\u03b1\u03b2 \u226a 1 and we use \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 to rise and lower indices so that, for example, h\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03b7 \u03b1 \u03bc \u03b7 \u03b2 \u03bd h\u03bc\u03bd . In many cases the origin of the\ncoordinates is placed to the center of mass of the astrophysical system. It eliminates the dipole component of the gravitational\nfield which is associated with a coordinate degree of freedom. In some cases, however, it is necessary to keep the dipole\ncomponent unrestricted in order to determine position of the center of mass of the system under consideration with respect to\nanother coordinate chart which is introduced independently for solving some other astronomical problems. This is important\nfor unambiguous interpretation of gravitational experiments done with astrometric instruments [54, 104]. Fact of the matter is\nthat the displacement of the center of mass of an astrophysical system from the origin of the coordinates induces translational\ndeformations of the higher-order multipole moments of the gravitational field which introduce a bias to the physical values of\nthe multipoles. Therefore, physical interpretation of the observed values of the multipoles requires identification of the dipole\nmoment and subtraction of the coordinate deformations caused by it. We shall discard the dipole component of the gravitational\nfield in our solution.\nThe most general expression for the linearised perturbation of the metric tensor outside of the astronomical system emitting\ngravitational radiation was derived by Blanchet and Damour [64] by solving Einstein's equations. The perturbation is given in\nterms of the symmetric and trace-free (STF) mass and spin multipole moments (similar formulas were derived by Thorne [5])\nand is described by the following expression\nh\u03b1\u03b2 = hcan.\n\u03b1\u03b2 + w\u03b1 ,\u03b2 + w\u03b2 ,\u03b1 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere w\u03b1 are, the so-called, gauge functions describing the freedom in the choice of coordinates covering the manifold. The\ncanonical perturbation, hcan.\n\u03b1\u03b2 , obeys the homogeneous wave equation in vacuum\n\u0003hcan.\n\u03b1\u03b2 = 0 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhich solution is chosen as\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u221e\n(\u22121)l IAl (t \u2212 r)\n2M\n+2\u2211\n,\nr\nr\n,Al\nl=2 l!\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u221e\n2\u03b5ipq S p (t \u2212 r)Nq\n(\u22121)l l \u03b5ipq S pAl\u22121 (t \u2212 r)\ncan.\nh0i (t, x) = \u2212\n\u22124\u2211\n+\nr2\nr\n,qAl\u22121\nl=2 (l + 1)!\n\"\n#\n\u221e\n(\u22121)l I \u0307iAl\u22121 (t \u2212 r)\n,\n4\u2211\nr\nl=2 l!\n\nhcan.\n00 (t, x) =\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\n,Al\u22121\n\ncan.\ncan.\nhcan.\ni j (t, x) =\u03b4i j h00 (t, x) + qi j (t, x)\n\u221e\n\n\"\n\n(\u22121)l I \u0308i jAl\u22122 (t \u2212 r)\nr\nl=2 l!\n\nqcan.\ni j (t, x) =4 \u2211\n\n,\n#\n\n(7)\n(\u22121)l l \u03b5 pq(i S \u0307j)pAl\u22122 (t \u2212 r)\nr\nl=2 (l + 1)!\n\u221e\n\n\u22128 \u2211\n\n,Al\u22122\n\n\"\n\n#\n\n,qAl\u22122\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\n\f9\nHere M and Si are the total mass and spin (angular momentum) of the system, and IAl and SAl are two independent sets\nof mass-type and spin-type multipole moments, N i = xi /r is a unit vector directed from the origin of the coordinate system to\nthe field point. Because the origin of the coordinate system has been chosen at the center of mass, the expansions (5) \u2013 (8)\ndo not depend on the mass-type dipole moment, Ii , which is equal to zero by definition. We emphasize that in the linearised\napproximation the total mass M and spin Si of the astronomical system are constant while all other multipoles are functions of\ntime which temporal behaviour obeys the equations of motion derived from the law of conservation of the stress-energy tensor\nof the system [1, 2]. Gravitational waves emitted by the system reduce its energy, linear and angular momenta. This effect does\nnot appear in the linearised general relativity but in higher order approximations we would obtain where the mass, spin, and\nlinear momentum of the system must be considered as functions of time like any other multipole. Higher-order gravitational\nperturbations in the metric going beyond (5)\u2013(8) are shown in a review paper by Blanchet [105]. They are not of concern in the\npresent chapter.\nThe canonical metric tensor (5)\u2013(8) depends on the multipole moments IAl (t \u2212 r) and SAl (t \u2212 r) taken at the retarded instant\nof time. The retardation is explained by the finite speed of propagation of gravity (light propagation will be considered below).\nIn the near zone of the isolated system the retardation due to the propagation of gravity is small and all functions of time in the\nmetric tensor can be expanded in Taylor series around the present time t [5, 64]. This near-zone expansion of the metric tensor\nis called the post-Newtonian expansion leading to the post-Newtonian successive approximations [54]. The post-Newtonian\nexpansion can be smoothly matched to the solution of the linearized Einstein equations in the domain of space being occupied\nby matter of the isolated system. The matching allows us to express the multipole moments in terms of matter variables [65]\n\n\u03c3 \u2261 T 00 + T kk ,\n\n\u03c3 i \u2261 T 0i ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere T \u03b1\u03b2 is the stress-energy tensor of matter bounded in space. In the first post-Newtonian approximation the multipole\nmoments have a matter-compact support [65]\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ\n|x|2 x<Al > 2\n4(2l + 1)x<iAl >\n1PN\n3\nIAl\n=\nd x x<Al > \u03c3 +\n\u2202 \u03c3\u2212\n\u2202t \u03c3i + O(c\u22124 ) ,\n(10)\n2(2l + 3) t\n(l + 1)(2l + 3)\nV\nSA1PN\n=\nl\n\nZ\n\nV\n\nd 3 x\u03b5 pq<al xAl\u22121 p> \u03c3q + O(c\u22122 ) ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere notations have been explained in section I C. In the higher post-Newtonian approximations the multipole moments have\ncontributions coming directly from the stress-energy tensor of gravitational field (Landau-Lifshitz pseudotensor) which have\nnon-compact support. Therefore, the multipole moments are expressed by more complicated functionals [105]. Radiative\napproximation of the canonical metric tensor reveals that contribution of the tails of gravitational waves must be added to the\ndefinitions of the multipole moments (10), (11) so that the multipole moments in the radiative zone of the isolated system read\n[66, 67, 106]\nIAl =\n\nIA1PN\n+ 2M\nl\n\nZ+\u221e\n0\n\nSAl =\n\nSA1PN\n+ 2M\nl\n\nd \u03b6 I \u0308A1PN\n(t \u2212 r \u2212 \u03b6 )\nl\n\n\" \u0012 \u0013\n#\nl\u22122\n\u03b6\n2l 2 + 5l + 4\n1\nln\n+\n,\n+\u2211\n2b\nl(l + 1)(l + 2) k=1\nk\n\nZ+\u221e\n0\n\n\" \u0012 \u0013\n#\nl\u22121\n\u03b6\n1\nl\u22121\n1PN\n \u0308\nd \u03b6 SAl (t \u2212 r \u2212 \u03b6 ) ln\n+\n,\n+\u2211\n2b\nl(l + 1) k=1\nk\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\nwhere b is a normalization constant which value is supposed to be absorbed to the definition of the origin of time scale in the\nradiative zone but this statement has not been checked so far.\nB. The harmonic coordinates\n\nEquation (3) holds in an arbitrary gauge imposed on the metric tensor. The harmonic gauge is defined by the condition [54]\n2h\n\u03bc\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\n,\u03b2\n\n\u2212 h,\u03b1 = 0 ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere h \u2261 h \u03bc . The gauge condition (14) reduces the Einstein vacuum field equations to the wave equation (4) for the gravitational potentials h\u03b1\u03b2 . Harmonic coordinates x\u03b1 are defined as solutions of the homogeneous wave equation \u0003x\u03b1 = 0 up to\nthe gauge functions w\u03b1 . In particular, the harmonic canonical coordinates are defined by the condition that all gauge functions\nw\u03b1 = 0. The canonical metric tensor (5) \u2013 (8) depends on two sets of multipole moments [5, 64] which reflects the existence of\n\n\f10\nonly two degrees of freedom of a free (detached from matter) gravitational field in general relativity [1\u20133]. At the same time one\ncan obtain a generic expression for the harmonic metric tensor by making use of infinitesimal coordinate transformation\nx\u2032\u03b1 = x\u03b1 \u2212 w\u03b1\n\n(15)\n\nfrom the canonical harmonic coordinates x\u03b1 to arbitrary harmonic coordinates x\u2032\u03b1 with the harmonic gauge functions w\u03b1 which\nsatisfy to a homogeneous wave equation\n\u0003w\u03b1 = 0 .\n\n(16)\n\nThe most general solution of this vector equation contains four sets of STF multipoles [5, 64]\n\u221e \u0014 W (t \u2212 r) \u0015\nAl\n,\nw0 = \u2211\nr\n,Al\nl=0\ni\n\n\u221e\n\nw =\n\n\u2211\n\n\u0014\n\nl=0\n\u221e \u0014\n\n\u2211\n\nXAl (t \u2212 r)\nr\n\n\u03b5ipq\n\nl=1\n\n\u0015\n\n\u221e\n\n,iAl\n\n+\u2211\n\nl=1\n\nZqAl\u22121 (t \u2212 r)\nr\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\nYiAl\u22121 (t \u2212 r)\nr\n\n\u0015\n\n+\n\n(17)\n\n(18)\n\n,Al\u22121\n\n,\n\n,pAl\u22121\n\nwhere WAl , XAl , YiAl\u22121 , and ZqAl\u22121 are Cartesian tensors depending on the retarded time. Their specific form is a matter of\ncomputational convenience (or the boundary conditions) for derivation and interpretation of observable effects but it does not\naffect the invariant quantities like the phase of electromagnetic wave propagating through the field of the multipoles.\nThe most convenient choice simplifying the structure of the metric tensor perturbations, is given by the following gauge\nfunctions\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nl I (\u22121) (t \u2212 r)\n\u221e\n(\u22121)\n\uf8f0 Al\n\uf8fb ,\n(19)\nw0 = \u2211\nl!\nr\nl=2\n,Al\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n\n(\u22122)\n\u221e\n(\u22121)l \uf8f0 IAl (t \u2212 r) \uf8fb\n\nwi = \u2211\n\nl=2\n\n\u221e\n\nl!\n\nr\n\n\u2212\n\n(20)\n\n,iAl\n\nl\n\nIiAl\u22121 (t \u2212 r)\n+\nr\n,Al\u22121\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n(\u22121)\n\u221e\n(\u22121)l l \uf8f0 \u03b5iba SbAl\u22121 (t \u2212 r) \uf8fb\n4\u2211\nr\nl=2 (l + 1)!\n(\u22121)\nl=2 l!\n\n4\u2211\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n.\n\n,aAl\u22121\n\nThese functions, after they are substituted to equation (3), transform the canonical metric tensor perturbation to a remarkably\nsimple form\nh00 =\n\n2M\n,\nr\n\nh0i = \u2212\n\n2\u03b5ipq S p Nq\n,\nr2\n\nhi j = \u03b4i j h00 + hTT\nij ,\nhTi jT = Pi jkl qcan.\nkl ,\n\n(21)\n(22)\n(23)\n(24)\n\nwhere the TT-projection differential operator Pi jkl , applied to the symmetric tensors depending on both time and spatial coordinates, is given by\n1\nPi jkl = (\u03b4ik \u2212 \u2206\u22121\u2202i \u2202k )(\u03b4 jl \u2212 \u2206\u22121\u2202 j \u2202l ) \u2212 (\u03b4i j \u2212 \u2206\u22121\u2202i \u2202 j )(\u03b4kl \u2212 \u2206\u22121\u2202k \u2202l ) ,\n2\n\n(25)\n\n\f11\nand \u2206 and \u2206\u22121 denote the Laplacian and the inverse Laplacian respectively.\nWhen comparing the canonical metric tensor with that given by equations (21)\u2013(24) it is instructive to keep in mind that\n(\u22122) I \u0308 (t \u2212 r) = I (t \u2212 r) and \u2206(I (t \u2212 r)/r) = I \u0308 (t \u2212 r)/r for r 6= 0. This is a consequence of the fact that function\nAl\nAl\nAl\nAl\nh\ni\n(\u22122) I \u0308 (t \u2212 r) is a solution of the homogeneous d'Lambert's equation, that is, \u0003 (\u22122) I (t \u2212 r)/r = 0 for r 6= 0. We also notice\nAl\nAl\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\nthat IAl (t \u2212 r)/r = \u2206\u22121 I \u0308Al (t \u2212 r)/r and (\u22122) I Al (t \u2212 r)/r = \u2206\u22121 IAl (t \u2212 r)/r . The metric tensor harmonic perturbation\n(21)\u2013(24) is similar to the Coulomb gauge in electrodynamics [107, 108].\nC. The ADM coordinates\n\nThe Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) gauge condition in the linear approximation is given by two equations [61]\n2h0i,i \u2212 hii,0 = 0 ,\n\n3hi j, j \u2212 h j j,i = 0 ,\n\n(26)\n\nwhere the second equation holds exactly, and for any function f = f (t, x) we use notations: f,0 = \u2202 f /\u2202 t and f,i = \u2202 f /\u2202 xi . For\ncomparison, the harmonic gauge condition (14) in the linear approximation reads:\n2h0i,i \u2212 hii,0 = h00,0 ,\n\n2hi j, j \u2212 h j j,i = \u2212h00,i .\n\n(27)\n\nThe ADM gauge condition (26) brings the space-space component of the metric to the following form\n1\ngi j = \u03b4i j (1 + hkk ) + hTT\nij ,\n3\n\n(28)\n\nwhere hTi jT denotes the transverse-traceless part of hi j and hkk = 3h00. The ADM and harmonic gauge conditions are not\ncompatible inside the regions occupied by matter. However, outside of matter they can co-exist simultaneously. Indeed, it\nis straightforward to check out that the metric tensor (21)\u2013(24) satisfies both the harmonic and the ADM gauge conditions in the\nlinear approximation along with the assumption that M \u0307 = 0. This was first noticed in [100]. We call the coordinates in which\nthe metric tensor is given by equations (21)\u2013(24) as the ADM-harmonic coordinates.\nThe experimental problem of detection of gravitational waves is reduced to the observation of motion of test particles in\nthe field of the incident or incoming gravitational wave. These test particles are photons in the electromagnetic wave used in\nobservations and mirrors in ground-based gravitational-wave detectors or pulsars and Earth in case of using a pulsar timing\narray. The gravitational wave affects propagation of photons and perturbs motion of the mirrors or pulsars and Earth. These\nperturbations must be explicitly calculated and clearly separated from noise to avoid possible misinterpretation of observable\neffects due to the gravitational wave. It turns out that the canonical form of the metric tensor (5) \u2013 (8) is well-adapted for\nperforming an analytic integration of equations of light rays. At the same time, freely-falling mirrors (or pulsars and Earth)\nexperience influence of gravitational waves emitted by the isolated astronomical system and move with respect to the coordinate\ngrid of the canonical harmonic coordinates in a complicated way. For this reason, the perturbations produced by the gravitational\nwaves on the light propagation get mixed up with the motion of massive test particles in these coordinates.\nArnowitt, Deser and Misner [61] showed that there exist canonical ADM coordinates which have a special property such that\nfreely-falling massive particles are not moving with respect to this coordinates despite that they are perturbed by the gravitational\nwaves. This means that the ADM coordinates themselves are not inertial and, although have an advantage in treating motion\nof massive test particles, should be used with care in the interpretation of gravitational wave experiments. Making use of the\ncanonical ADM coordinates simplifies analysis of the gravitational wave effects observed at gravitational wave observatories\n(LIGO, LISA, NGO, etc.) or by astronomical technique because the motion of observer (proof mass) is excluded from the\nequations. However, the mathematical structure of the metric tensor in the canonical ADM coordinates does not allow us to\ndirectly integrate equations for light rays analytically because it contains terms that are instantaneous functions of time. Integrals\nfrom these instantaneous functions of time cannot be performed explicitly [100].\nThe ADM-harmonic coordinates have the advantages of both harmonic and ADM coordinates. Thus, the ADM-harmonic\ncoordinates allow us to get a full analytic solution of the light-ray equations and to eliminate the effects produced by the\nmotion of observers with respect to the coordinate grid caused by the influence of gravitational waves. In other words, all\nphysical effects produced by gravitational waves are contained merely in the solution of the equations of light propagation. This\nconclusion is, of course, valid in the linear approximation of general relativity and is not extended to the second approximation\nwhere gravitational-wave effects on light and motion of observers can not be disentangled and have to be analysed together.\nSimilar ideology based on the introduction of TT coordinates , has been earlier applied for analysis of the output signal of the\ngravitational-wave detectors with freely-suspended masses [1, 2, 25] placed to the field of a plane gravitational wave, that is at the\ndistance far away from the localized astronomical system emitting gravitational waves where the curvature of the gravitationalwave front is negligible. Our ADM-harmonic coordinates are an essential generalization of the standard TT coordinates because\nthey can be constructed at an arbitrary distance from the astronomical system, thus, covering the near, intermediate and radiative\nzones.\n\n\f12\nIII.\n\nEQUATIONS OF PROPAGATION OF ELECTROMAGNETIC SIGNALS\nA.\n\nMaxwell equations in curved spacetime\n\nIn this section we treat gravitational field exactly without approximation. Therefore, all indices are raised and lowered by\nmeans of the metric tensor g\u03b1\u03b2 with g\u03b1\u03b2 defined in accordance with the standard rule g\u03b1\u03b2 g\u03b2 \u03b3 = \u03b4\u03b2\u03b1 . The general formalism\ndescribing the behavior of electromagnetic radiation in an arbitrary gravitational field is well known and can be found, for example, in textbooks [1, 2, 109] or in reviews [110, 111]. Electromagnetic field is defined in terms of the (complex) electromagnetic\ntensor F\u03b1\u03b2 as a solution of the Maxwell equations. In the high-frequency limit one can approximate the electromagnetic tensor\nF\u03b1\u03b2 as [1, 2]\nF\u03b1\u03b2 = {A\u03b1\u03b2 exp(i\u03c6 )} ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere A\u03b1\u03b2 is a slowly varying (complex) amplitude and \u03c6 is a rapidly varying phase of the electromagnetic wave which is called\neikonal [1, 112], and i is the imaginary unit, i2 = \u22121. In the most general case of propagation of light in a transparent medium\nthe eikonal is a complex function which real and imaginary parts are connected by the Kramers-Kr \u0301'onig dispersion relations\n[107]. We shall consider propagation of light in vacuum and neglect the imaginary part of the eikonal that is associated with\nabsorption. Of course, the amplitude, A\u03b1\u03b2 , and phase, \u03c6 , are functions of both time and spatial coordinates.\nThe source-free (vacuum) Maxwell equations are given by [1, 2]\n\u2207\u03b1 F\u03b2 \u03b3 + \u2207\u03b2 F\u03b3\u03b1 + \u2207\u03b3 F\u03b1\u03b2 = 0 ,\n\n(2)\n\n\u2207\u03b2 F \u03b1\u03b2 = 0 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u2207\u03b1 denotes covariant differentiation. Taking a covariant divergence from equation (2), using equation (3) and applying\nthe rule of commutation of covariant derivatives of a tensor field of a second rank, we obtain the covariant wave equation for the\nelectromagnetic field tensor\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u0003g F\u03b1\u03b2 + R\u03b1\u03b2 \u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd + R\u03bc\u03b1 F\u03b2 \u2212 R\u03bc\u03b2 F\u03b1 = 0 ,\n\n(4)\n\n\u03b3\n\nwhere \u0003g \u2261 g\u03b1\u03b2 \u2207\u03b1 \u2207\u03b2 , R\u03b1\u03b2 \u03bc\u03bd is the Riemann curvature tensor, and R\u03b1\u03b2 = R \u03b1\u03b3\u03b2 is the Ricci tensor (definitions of the Riemann\nand Ricci tensors in this chapter are the same as in the textbook [3]). We consider the case of propagation of light in vacuum\nwhere the stress-energy tensor of matter, T \u03b1\u03b2 , is absent. Due to the Einstein equations it yields R\u03b1\u03b2 = 0. Hence, in our case (4)\nis reduced to a more simple form\n\u0003g F\u03b1\u03b2 + R\u03b1\u03b2 \u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd = 0 .\n\n(5)\n\nDifferential operator \u0003g in (4) taken along with the Riemann and Ricci tensors is called de Rham's operator for the electromagnetic field [2? ].\nB. Maxwell equations in the geometric optics approximation\n\nLet us now assume that the electromagnetic tensor F\u03b1\u03b2 shown in (1) can be expanded with respect to a small dimensionless\nparameter \u03b5 = \u03bbem /L where \u03bbem is a characteristic wavelength of the electromagnetic wave and L is a characteristic radius\nof spacetime curvature. The parameter \u03b5 is a bookkeeping parameter of the high-frequency approximation in expansion of\nthe electromagnetic field beyond the limit of the geometric optics. More specifically, we assume that the expansion of the\nelectromagnetic field given by equation (1) has the following form [2]\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0001\ni\u03c6\n,\n(6)\nF\u03b1\u03b2 = a\u03b1\u03b2 + \u03b5 b\u03b1\u03b2 + \u03b5 2 c\u03b1\u03b2 + ... exp\n\u03b5\nwhere a\u03b1\u03b2 , b\u03b1\u03b2 , c\u03b1\u03b2 , etc. are functions of time and spatial coordinates.\nSubstituting expansion (6) into equation (2), taking into account a definition of the electromagnetic wave vector, l\u03b1 \u2261 \u2202 \u03c6 /\u2202 x\u03b1 ,\nand arranging the terms with similar powers of \u03b5 , lead to the chain of equations\nl\u03b1 a\u03b2 \u03b3 + l\u03b2 a\u03b3\u03b1 + l\u03b3 a\u03b1\u03b2 = 0 ,\n\n(7)\n\n\u2207\u03b1 a\u03b2 \u03b3 + \u2207\u03b2 a\u03b3\u03b1 + \u2207\u03b3 a\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212i l\u03b1 b\u03b2 \u03b3 + l\u03b2 b\u03b3\u03b1 + l\u03b3 b\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n\u0001\n\n(8)\n\n\f13\nwhere we have neglected the effects of spacetime curvature which are of the order of O(\u03b5 2 ) that are too small to measure.\nSimilarly, equation (3) gives a chain of equations\nl\u03b2 a\u03b1\u03b2 = 0 ,\n\n(9)\n\n\u2207\u03b2 a\u03b1\u03b2 + il\u03b2 b\u03b1\u03b2 = 0 ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere we again neglected the effects of spacetime curvature.\nEquation (9) implies that the amplitude, a\u03b1\u03b2 , of the electromagnetic field tensor is orthogonal in the four-dimensional sense\nto a wave vector l\u03b1 , at least, in the first approximation. Contracting equation (7) with l\u03b1 and accounting for (9), we find that the\nwave vector l\u03b1 is null, that is\nl\u03b1 l \u03b1 = 0 .\n\n(11)\n\nTaking a covariant derivative from this equation and using the fact that\n\u2207[\u03b2 l\u03b1 ] = 0 ,\n\n(12)\n\nbecause l\u03b1 = \u2207\u03b1 \u03c6 , one can show that the vector l\u03b1 obeys the null geodesic equation\nl \u03b2 \u2207\u03b2 l \u03b1 = 0 .\n\n(13)\n\nIt means that the null vector l \u03b1 is parallel transported along itself in the curved spacetime. Equation (13) can be expressed more\nexplicitly as\ndl \u03b1\n+ \u0393\u03b2\u03b1 \u03b3 l \u03b2 l \u03b3 = 0 ,\nd\u03c3\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u03c3 is an affine parameter along the light-ray trajectory, and\n\u0001\n1\n\u0393\u03b2\u03b1 \u03b3 = g\u03b1 \u03bc \u2202\u03b3 g\u03bc\u03b2 + \u2202\u03b2 g\u03bc\u03b3 \u2212 \u2202\u03bc g\u03b2 \u03b3 ,\n2\n\n(15)\n\nare the Christoffel symbols.\nFinally, contracting equation (8) with l \u03b3 , and using (7), (9), (10) along with (12) we can show that in the first approximation\nl \u03b3 \u2207\u03b3 a\u03b1\u03b2 + \u03b8 a\u03b1\u03b2 = 0 ,\n\n(16)\n\n\u03b8 \u2261 (1/2)\u2207\u03b1 l \u03b1 ,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere\n\nis the expansion of the light-ray congruence defined at each point of spacetime by the derivative of the wave vector l \u03b1 .\nEquation (16) represents the law of propagation of the tensor amplitude of electromagnetic wave along the light ray. In\nthe most general general case, when the expansion \u03b8 6= 0, the tensor amplitude of the electromagnetic wave is not paralleltransported along the light rays. It can be shown that the expansion \u03b8 of the light-ray congruence is defined only by the\nstationary components of the gravitational field of the isolated astronomical system determined by its mass M , and spin S i , but\nit does not depend on the higher-order multipole moments. It means that gravitational waves do not contribute to the expansion\nof the light-ray congruence in the linearised approximation of general relativity and their impact on \u03b8 is postponed to the terms\nof the second order of magnitude with respect to the universal gravitational constant G.\nC. Electromagnetic eikonal and light-ray geodesics\nThe unperturbed congruence of light rays\n\nWe have assumed that geometric optics approximation is valid and electromagnetic waves propagate in vacuum. We also assume that each electromagnetic wave has a wavelength \u03bbem much smaller than the characteristic wavelength \u03bbgw of gravitational\nwaves emitted by the isolated astronomical system. Physical speed of light in vacuum, measured locally, is equal to the speed of\npropagation of gravitational waves, and is equal to the fundamantal speed c in tangent Minkowski spacetime. We have neglected\nall relativistic effects associated with the curvature tensor of spacetime in equations of light propagation. In accordance with the\nconsideration given in previous section III B, a kinematic description of propagation of each electromagnetic wave can be given\n\n\f14\n\nNorth\n\nJ\n\u03c4\n\nI0\n\n\u03bei\n\nK\n\nTo observer\n\nVector field of light rays\n\n\u03b8\n\n\u03a9\n\nx i = k i\u03c4 + \u03bei\n\n\u03be\n\ni\n\nK0\n\nI\n\nEast\n\n\u03c4\n\nTo observer\n\nPlane of the sky\nFIG. 2: Astronomical coordinates used in calculation of light propagation. The origin of the coordinates is at the center-of-mass of the source\nof gravitational waves. The bundle of light rays is defined by a vector field ki . Vector K i = \u2212ki + O(c\u22122 ) is directed from observer towards\nthe source of light. Vector K0i is directed from the observer towards the source of gravitational waves. We define K0i = \u2212N i = \u2212xi /r, where\nxi are the coordinates of observer with respect to the source of gravitational waves, and r = |x|. The picture shows the plane of the sky being\northogonal to vector K i .\n\nby tracking position of its phase \u03c6 , which is a null hypersurface in spacetime, as a function of time or by following the congruence of light rays that are orthogonal to the phase. Quantum electrodynamics tells us that the light rays are tracks of massless\nparticles of the quantized electromagnetic field (photons) which are moving along light-ray geodesics defined by equation (14).\nParticular solution of these equations can be found after imposing the initial-boundary conditions\ndx(\u2212\u221e)\n=k.\ndt\n\nx(t0 ) = x0 ,\n\n(18)\n\nThese conditions determine the spatial position, x0 , of an electromagnetic signal (a photon) at the time of its emission, t0 , and\nthe initial direction of its propagation given by the unit vector, k, at the past null infinity , that is at the infinite spatial distance\nand at the infinite past [2, 3] where the spacetime is assumed to be flat (see Fig. 1). We imply that vector k is directed towards\nobserver. Notice that the initial-boundary conditions (18) have been chosen as a matter of convenience only. Instead of them,\nwe could chose two boundary conditions when both the point of emission and that of observation of the electromagnetic signal\nare fixed in time and space. It is always possible to convert solution of equations of the null geodesics given in terms of the\ninitial-boundary conditions to that given in terms of the boundary conditions. We discuss it in section V C.\nIn the next sections we will derive an explicit form of equations of null geodesics and solve them by iterations with the initial\nboundary conditions (18). At the first iteration we can neglect relativistic perturbation of photon's motion and approximate it by\na straight line\nxi = xiN (t) \u2261 xi0 + ki (t \u2212 t0 ) ,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere t0 is the time of emission of electromagnetic signal, xi0 are spatial coordinates of the source of the electromagnetic signal\ntaken at the time t0 , and ki = k is the unit vector along the trajectory of photon's motion defined in (18).\nThe bundle of light rays makes 2+1 split of space by projecting any point in space onto the plane being orthogonal to the\nbundle (see Figure 2). This allows to make a transformation to new independent variables, \u03c4 and \u03be i , defined as follows\n\n\u03c4 = ki xiN\n\n,\n\n\u03be i = Pij xNj ,\n\n(20)\n\n\f15\nwhere\nPij = \u03b4 ji \u2212 ki k j ,\n\n(21)\n\n\u03c4 \u2261 k * x = t \u2212 t\u2217 ,\n\n(22)\n\nt \u2217 \u2261 k * x0 \u2212 t0 ,\n\n(23)\n\nis the operator of projection on the plane being orthogonal to k. It is easy to see that the parameter \u03c4 is equivalent to time\n\nwhere\n\nis the time of the closest approach of the electromagnetic signal to the origin of the spatial coordinates which is taken, in our\ncase, coinciding with the center of mass of the isolated astronomical system. Because for each light ray the time t \u2217 is fixed, we\nconclude that the time differential d \u03c4 = dt on the light ray. The reader may expect that the results of our calculation of observable\nquantities are to depend on the parameters \u03be i and t \u2217 . This is, however, not true since \u03be i and t \u2217 depend on the choice of the origin\nof the coordinates and direction of its spatial axes that is they are coordinate-dependent. The observable quantities have nothing\nto do with the choice of coordinates and, thus, \u03be i and t \u2217 cannot enter the expressions for observable quantities. Inspection of the\nresulting equations in the sections which follow, shows that parameters \u03be i and t \u2217 do vanish from the observed quantities.\nThe unperturbed light-ray trajectory (19) written in terms of the new variables (20) reads\nxiN (\u03c4 ) = ki \u03c4 + \u03be i ,\n\n(24)\n\nso that the new variable \u03be i \u2261 \u03be = k \u00d7 (x \u00d7 k) should be understood as a vector drawn from the origin of the coordinate system\ni\ni\ntowards\np the point of the closest approach of the ray to the origin. For vectors k and \u03be are orthogonal, the unperturbed distance\nrN = xi xi between the photon and the origin of the coordinate system\np\n(25)\nrN = \u03c4 2 + d 2 ,\nwhere d = |\u03be| is the impact parameter of the unperturbed light-ray trajectory with respect to the coordinate origin.\nWe introduce two other operators of partial derivatives with respect to \u03c4 and \u03be i determined for any smooth function taken on\nthe congruence of light rays. These operators will be denoted with a hat above them and are defined as\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\u02c6\u03c4 \u2261\n\u2202\u03c4\n\n,\n\n\u2202\n,\n\u2202\u02c6i \u2261 Pi j\n\u2202\u03be j\n\n,\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\u02c6t \u2217 \u2261 \u2217\n\u2202t\n\n(26)\n\nso that, for example,\nki \u2202\u02c6i = 0 .\n\n(27)\n\nAn important consequence of the projective structure of the bundle of the light rays is that for any smooth function F(t, x)\ndefined on the light-ray trajectories, one has\n\u0013\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0012\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\nF(t \u2217 + \u03c4 , \u03be + k\u03c4 ) ,\n+\nk\n(28)\nF(t\n,\nx)\n+\nk\n=\ni\ni\ni\n\u2202 xi\n\u2202t\n\u2202\n\u03be\n\u2202\n\u03c4\nx=x0 +k(t\u2212t0 )\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014\u0012\nd\n\u2202\ni \u2202\n+ k i F(t , x)\n= F(t \u2217 + \u03c4 , \u03be + k\u03c4 ) ,\n(29)\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\nd\n\u03c4\nx=x0 +k(t\u2212t0 )\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u2202\n\u2202\nF(t , x)\n= \u2217 F(t \u2217 + \u03c4 , \u03be + k\u03c4 ).\n(30)\n\u2202t\n\u2202\nt\nx=x0 +k(t\u2212t0 )\nHere, in the left sides of Eqs. (28)\u2013(30) one must, first, calculate the partial derivatives and only after that substitute the unperturbed trajectory of the light ray, x = x0 + k(t \u2212t0 ), while in the right side of these equations one, first, substitute the unperturbed\ntrajectory parameterized by the variables \u03c4 and \u03be i and, then, differentiate. Equations (28)\u2013(30) define the commutation rule of\ninterchanging the operations of substitution of the light ray trajectory to a function defined on spacetime manifold and the calculation of the partial derivatives from the function. It turns out to be very effective for analytic integration of the light-ray geodesic\nequations.\nIt is worth noticing that (30) allows us to re-write (28) as follows\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202 F(t, x)\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2217\n\u2212\nk\n(31)\n=\n+\nk\ni \u2217 F(t + \u03c4 , \u03be + k \u03c4 ) .\ni\ni\n\u2202 xi\n\u2202\n\u03be\n\u2202\n\u03c4\n\u2202\nt\nx=x0 +k(t\u2212t0 )\nThis equation will be used later for decomposing STF spatial derivatives from the potentials of gravitational field depending on\nretarded time.\n\n\f16\nThe eikonal equation\n\nThe eikonal \u03c6 is related to the wave vector l \u03b1 of the electromagnetic wave as l\u03b1 = \u2202\u03b1 \u03c6 .

It is reduced to a more explicit form after making use of the linearized\npost-Minkowskian expressions for the Christoffel symbols\n1\n\u0393000 = \u2212 \u2202t h00 (t, x) ,\n2\n1\n0\n\u03930i = \u2212 \u2202i h00 (t, x) ,\n2\n\u0003\n1\u0002\n0\n\u0393i j = \u2212 \u2202i h0 j (t, x) + \u2202 j h0i (t, x) \u2212 \u2202t hi j (t, x) ,\n2\n1\ni\n\u039300 = \u2202t h0i (t, x) \u2212 \u2202i h00 (t, x) ,\n2\n\u0003\n1\u0002\ni\n\u2202 j h0i (t, x) \u2212 \u2202ih0 j (t, x) + \u2202t hi j (t, x) ,\n\u03930 j =\n2\n1\ni\n\u0393 j p = [\u2202 j hip (t, x) + \u2202 phi j (t, x) \u2212 \u2202i h j p (t, x)] .\n2\n\n(49)\n(50)\n(51)\n(52)\n(53)\n(54)\n\n\f18\nThe affine parameter \u03c3 in this equation is an implicit function of the coordinate time t.

Effectively, there is no\nneed to solve (55) explicitly as we are not interested in the parameter \u03c3 because the coordinate time t is more practical parameter\nwhich can be measured with clocks. Therefore, we express the spatial components of the geodesic equation (14) in terms of\nthe Christoffel symbols (49)\u2013(54), and replace differentiation with respect to the canonical parameter \u03c3 by differentiation with\nrespect to the coordinate time t. With the help of equation (55) the spatial components of the geodesic equation for light ray\npropagation becomes\n1\n1\n\u1e8di (t) = h00,i \u2212 h0i,0 \u2212 h00,0\u1e8bi \u2212 hik,0 \u1e8bk \u2212 (h0i,k \u2212 h0k,i )\u1e8bk \u2212\n2\n2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\nk j\nk i\nh00,k \u1e8b \u1e8b \u2212 hik, j \u2212 hk j,i \u1e8b \u1e8b +\nhk j,0 \u2212 h0k, j \u1e8bk \u1e8b j \u1e8bi ,\n2\n2\n\n(56)\n\nwhere h00 , h0i , hi j are components of the metric tensor taken on the unperturbed light-ray trajectory as shown in equations\n(39)\u2013(47), that is h\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 h\u03b1\u03b2 (t, xN (t)).\nEquation (56) can be further simplified after substituting the unperturbed light-ray trajectory (24) to the right side of Eq. (56)\nand making use of equation (28).

We discuss the choice of the gauge functions later on in next subsection.\nThe main advantage of the form (57) to which we have reduced the light ray propagation equation (14) is the convenience of\nits analytic integration. Indeed, when we integrate along the light-ray path the following rules, applied to any smooth function\nF(\u03c4 , \u03be), can be used\nZ\nZ\n\n\u2202\nF(\u03c4 , \u03be) d \u03c4 =F(\u03c4 , \u03be) + C(\u03be) ,\n\u2202\u03c4\n\u2202\n\u2202\nF(\u03c4 , \u03be) d \u03c4 = i\n\u2202\u03bei\n\u2202\u03be\n\nZ\n\nF(\u03c4 , \u03be) d \u03c4 .\n\n(58)\n\n(59)\n\nThis means that terms which are represented as partial derivatives with respect to the time parameter \u03c4 can be immediately\nintegrated out by making use of (58). At the same time (59) shows that one can change the order of integration and differentiation\nwith respect to the parameter \u03be i . It allows us to calculate the integral along the light ray from a more simple scalar expression\ninstead of integrating a vector function. This technique will be demonstrated explicitly in next sections.\nEquation (57) is linear with respect to the perturbation of the metric tensor, h\u03b1\u03b2 . Hence, it can be linearly decomposed in the\nequation for perturbations of the light-ray trajectory caused separately by mass and spin multipole moments.

It is worth emphasizing\nthat we do not intend to separate ki \u03c6 0 \u2212 \u03c6 i in two functions, \u03c6 i and \u03c6 0 because such a separation is not unique while the linear\ncombination ki \u03c6 0 \u2212 \u03c6 i is unambiguous. We have not combined functions \u03c6 \u03b1 with the gauge functions w\u03b1 for two reasons:\n1. to indicate that the solution of equations of light-ray geodesic, performed in one specific coordinate system, leads to\ngeneration of terms which can be eliminated by gauge transformation,\n2. to simplify the final form of the result of the integration as all terms with second and higher order time derivatives are\nimmediately integrated in accordance with (58).\nGauge functions w\u03b1 are still arbitrary which makes our equations gauge-invariant. However, for the sake of physical interpretation of the result of integration of equations of light-ray geodesic, we shall choose a specific form of functions w\u03b1 to make our\ncoordinate system both harmonic and ADM which makes the coordinate description of motion of free-falling particles in these\ncoordinates simple. Specific form of the gauge functions w\u03b1 at arbitrary field point is shown in equations (17), (18) and their\nform at any point on the light-ray trajectory is given in equations (66),(67).\nIt is important to notice that all terms depending on mass-type multipoles of the order l in the right sides of (62) have\na numerical factor 1 \u2212 p/l where p is the summation index. Such terms vanish when p = l. It means that (62) does not\ncontain terms with the time derivatives of the order l from the multipoles of the l-th order which, actually, describe gravitational\nwave emission from the astrophysical system because they decay slowly as 1/r. The same is true with regard to the spin-type\nmultipoles of the order l \u2212 1 in (63) \u2013 the time derivatives of the order of l \u2212 1 from the spin-type multipoles (which decay as 1/r)\nvanish in the right side of (63). Explicit analytic integration of such terms would be impossible but they simply do not present in\n\n\f20\nthe solution of general relativistic equations of light propagation for the reason mentioned above. It is this property of the null\ngeodesic in general relativity which prevents the amplification of the gravitational wave perturbation for a light ray propagating\nclosely to an astrophysical system emitting multipolar gravitational radiation (binary star, etc.). This fact was established in\n[100] in a quadrupole approximation and extended to any multipole in [103]. Present chapter confirms this result. The reader\nshould notice that the cancellation of these terms occurs only in general relativity.\nGauge freedom of equations of propagation of light\n\nGauge functions w\u03b1 , generating the coordinate transformation from the canonical harmonic coordinates to the ADM-harmonic\nones, are given by equations (19), (20). They transform the metric tensor as follows\nhcan.\n\u03b1\u03b2 = h\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 \u2202\u03b1 w\u03b2 \u2212 \u2202\u03b2 w\u03b1 ,\n\n(65)\n\ncan. is the canonical form of the metric tensor in harmonic coordinates given by equations (5)\u2013(8) and h\nwhere h\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b1\u03b2 is the metric\ntensor given in the ADM-harmonic coordinates by equations (21)\u2013(24).\nThe gauge functions taken on the light-ray trajectory and expressed in terms of the variables \u03be and \u03c4 can be written down in\nthe next form\n\nw0 =\n\n\u221e\n\nl\n\np\n\n\u2211\u2211\u2211\n\nZ \u03c4 +t \u2217\n\nl=2 p=0 q=0 \u2212\u221e\n\ndu h l00pq (u, \u03c4 , \u03be),\n\u221e\n\np\n\nl\n\n\u2211\u2211\n\nwi = (\u2202\u02c6i + ki \u2202\u02c6\u03c4 \u2212 ki \u2202\u02c6t \u2217 ) \u2211\n\nZ \u03c4 +t \u2217\n\nl=2 p=0 q=0 \u2212\u221e\n\n\u221e l\u22121 p\n\n\u22124 \u2211\n\n\u2211\u2211\n\n(66)\n\n(M)\n\nZ \u03c4 +t \u2217\n\ndu\n\nl=2 p=0 q=0 \u2212\u221e\n\ndv\n\nZ v\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndu h l00pq (u, \u03c4 , \u03be)\n(M)\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\nl pq\nl pq\nh 0i (u, \u03c4 , \u03be) + h0i (u, \u03c4 , \u03be)\n(S)\n(M)\n\n(67)\n\n,\n\nwhere h l00pq (u, \u03c4 , \u03be), h l0ipq (u, \u03c4 , \u03be) and hl0ipq (u, \u03c4 , \u03be) are defined by the Eqs.

Polarization of light and the Stokes parameters\nReference tetrad\n\nPropagation of electromagnetic fields in vacuum and evolution of their physical parameters in curved spacetime can be studied\nwith various mathematical techniques. One of the most convenient techniques was worked by Newman and Penrose [114, 115]\nand is called the Newman-Penrose formalism [110]. This formalism introduces at each point of spacetime a null tetrad of four\nvectors associated with the bundle of light rays defined by the electromagnetic wave vector field l \u03b1 . The Newman-Penrose\ntetrad consists of two real and two complex null vectors \u2013 (l \u03b1 , n\u03b1 , m\u03b1 , m\u0304\u03b1 ) \u2013 where the bar above function indicates complex\nconjugation. The null tetrad vectors are normalized in such a way that n\u03b1 l \u03b1 = \u22121 and m\u03b1 m\u0304\u03b1 = +1 are the only non-vanishing\nproducts among the four vectors of the tetrad.\n\n\f22\nThe vectors of the null tetrad are not uniquely determined by specifying l \u03b1 . Indeed, for a fixed direction l \u03b1 the normalization\nconditions for the tetrad vectors are preserved under the linear transformations (null rotation) [110, 114]\nl \u2032\u03b1 = Al \u03b1 ,\nn\u2032\u03b1 = A\u22121 (n\u03b1 + B\u0304m\u03b1 + Bm\u0304\u03b1 + BB\u0304l \u03b1 ) ,\n\n(74)\n(75)\n\nm\u2032\u03b1 = e\u2212i\u0398 (m\u03b1 + B\u0304l \u03b1 ) ,\n\n(76)\n\nm\u0304\n\n\u2032\u03b1\n\ni\u0398\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\n= e (m\u0304 + Bl ) ,\n\n(77)\n\nwhere A, \u0398 are real scalars and B = B1 + iB2 is a complex scalar. These transformations form a four-parameter (A, B1 , B2 , \u0398)\nsubgroup of the homogeneous Lorentz group which is equivalent to the point-like Lorentz transformations [109].\nFor doing mathematical analysis of the intensity and polarization of electromagnetic waves it is useful to introduce a local\northonormal reference frame of observer moving with a four velocity u\u03b1 who is seeing the electromagnetic wave travelling in\nthe positive\nn direction of z axis\no of the reference frame. It means that at each point of spacetime the observer uses a tetrad frame\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\ne (\u03b2 ) = e (0) , e (1) , e (2) , e (3) defined in such a way that\ne\u03b1(0) = u\u03b1\n\nh\ni\ne\u03b1(3) = (\u2212l\u03b1 u\u03b1 )\u22121 l \u03b1 + (l\u03b2 u\u03b2 )u\u03b1 ,\n\n,\n\n(78)\n\nand two other vectors of the observer's tetrad, e\u03b1(1) and e\u03b1(2) , are the unit space-like vectors being orthogonal to each other as\nwell as to e\u03b1(0) and e\u03b1(3) . In other words, vectors of the observer tetrad are subject to the following normalization conditions\n\u03b2\n\ng\u03b1\u03b2 e\u03b1(\u03bc ) e (\u03bd ) = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd e\u03b1(\u03bc ) e (\u03bd ) = g\u03b1\u03b2 .\n\n,\n\n(79)\n\nIt is worth noticing that the observer's tetrad e\u03b2\u03b1 has two group of indices. The indices without round brackets run from 0 to 3 and\nare associated with time and space coordinates. The indices enclosed in the round brackets numerate vectors of the tetrad and\nalso run from 0 to 3. The coordinate-type indices of the tetrad have no relation to the tetrad indices. If one changes spacetime\ncoordinates (passive coordinate transformation) it does not affect the tetrad indices while the coordinate indices of the tetrad\nchange in accordance with the transformation law for vectors. On the other hand, one can change the tetrad vectors at each\npoint in spacetime by doing the Lorentz transformation (active coordinate transformation) without changing the coordinate chart\n[115].\nLet us define at each point of spacetime a coordinate basis of static observers\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u03b1\nE (0) = 1 + h00 , 0 , 0 , 0 ,\n(80)\n2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n(81)\nE \u03b1(1) = h0 j a j , ai \u2212 hi j a j ,\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nE \u03b1(2) = h0 j b j , bi \u2212 hi j b j ,\n(82)\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nE \u03b1(3) = h0 j k j , ki \u2212 hi j k j ,\n(83)\n2\nwhich is written down for the case of weak gravitational field, g\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 + h\u03b1\u03b2 . Here the unit spatial vectors a = (a1 , a2 , a3 ),\nb = (b1 , b2 , b3 ), and k = (k1 , k2 , k3 ) are orthonormal in the Euclidean sense (\u03b4i j ai b j = \u03b4i j ai k j = \u03b4i j bi k j = 0 and \u03b4i j ai a j =\n\u03b4i j bi b j = \u03b4i j ki k j = 1) with vector k pointing to the direction of propagation of the light ray at infinity as given in (18). These\nbasis vectors are convenient to track the changes in the parameters of the electromagnetic wave as it travels from the point of\nemission of light to the point of its observation.\nThe local tetrad e\u03b1(\u03b2 ) of observers moving with four-velocity u\u03b1 with respect to the static observers relates to the tetrad E \u03b1(\u03b2 )\nby means of the Lorentz transformation\n\u03b3\n\n\u03b3\n\ne\u03b1(\u03b2 ) = \u039b \u03b2 E \u03b1(\u03b3 ) ,\n\nE \u03b1(\u03b2 ) = \u03bb \u03b2 e\u03b1(\u03b3 ) ,\n\n(84)\n\nwhere the matrix of the Lorentz transformation is [2]\n\u039b00 = u0 \u2261 \u03b3\n\n\u039bi0\n\n=\n\n\u039b0i\n\n(85)\n0\n\n=u ,\n\n\u039bi j = \u03b4 i j +\n\nui u j\n1+\u03b3\n\n(86)\n,\n\n(87)\n\n\f23\nand the inverse matrix of the Lorentz transformation \u03bb \u03b1\u03b2 is obtained from \u039b\u03b1\u03b2 by replacing ui \u2192 \u2212ui that complies with the\n\u03b2\n\ndefinition of the inverse matrix \u039b\u03b1\u03b2 \u03bb \u03b3 = \u03b4\u03b3\u03b1 .\nThe connection between the null tetrad and the observer's tetrad frame, e\u03b1(\u03b2 ) , is given by equations\nh\ni\nl \u03b1 = \u2212(l\u03b3 u\u03b3 ) e\u03b1(0) + e\u03b1(3) ,\nh\ni\n1\nn\u03b1 = \u2212 (l\u03b3 u\u03b3 ) e\u03b1(0) \u2212 e\u03b1(3) ,\n2\ni\n1 h \u03b1\n\u03b1\nm = \u221a e (1) + ie\u03b1(2) ,\n2\ni\nh\n1\nm\u0304\u03b1 = \u221a e\u03b1(1) \u2212 ie\u03b1(2) .\n2\n\n(88)\n(89)\n(90)\n(91)\n\nVector pairs e\u03b1(0) , e\u03b1(3) and e\u03b1(1) , e\u03b1(2) split spacetime at the point in two sub-spaces. In particular, vectors e\u03b1(1) , e\u03b1(2) defines the\nplane of polarization in spacetime. If vectors e\u03b1(0) and e\u03b1(3) are fixed, then, vectors e\u03b1(1) and e\u03b1(2) are defined up to an arbitrary\nrotation in the plane of polarization. Transformations (76), (77) with B = 0 yield\n\u2032\u03b1\n= cos \u0398 e\u03b1(1) + sin \u0398 e\u03b1(2) ,\ne(1)\n\n\u03b1\ne\u2032(2)\n\n=\n\n\u2212 sin \u0398 e\u03b1(1) + cos\u0398 e\u03b1(2)\n\n(92)\n,\n\n(93)\n\nwhere \u0398 is the rotation angle of the vectors in the plane of polarization. We notice that, since vectors e\u03b1(1) , e\u03b1(2) are orthogonal\nto e\u03b1(0) = u\u03b1 , the two null vectors, m\u03b1 and m\u0304\u03b1 , are also orthogonal to the four-velocity,\nm\u03b1 u \u03b1 = 0\n\nm\u0304\u03b1 u\u03b1 = 0 .\n\n,\n\n(94)\n\nThe null vector n\u03b1 is also orthogonal to u\u03b1 , n\u03b1 u\u03b1 = 0. On the other hand, the scalar product of l \u03b1 with four-velocity yields the\nangular frequency of electromagnetic wave, \u03c9 \u2261 \u2212l\u03b1 u\u03b1 .\nPropagation laws for the reference tetrad\n\nDiscussion of the rotation of the polarization plane and the change of the Stokes parameters of electromagnetic radiation is\ninconceivable without understanding of how the local reference frame propagates along the light-ray geodesic from the point of\nemission of light to the point of its observation. To this end we construct the reference tetrad frame of observer at the point of\nobservation of light and render a parallel transport of it backward in time along the light-ray geodesic. By definition, vectors of\nthe tetrad frame of the observer, e\u03b1(\u03b2 ) , and those of the null tetrad (l \u03b1 , n\u03b1 , m\u03b1 , m\u0304\u03b1 ) do not change in a covariant sense as they\nare parallel transported along the light ray. The propagation equation for the tetrad vectors are, thus, obtained by applying the\noperator D \u2261 l \u03b1 \u2207\u03b1 of the parallel transport along the null vector l \u03b1 . Explicit form of the parallel transport of the reference tetrad\nis\nde\u03b1(\u03bc )\nd\u03c3\n\n\u03b3\n\n+ \u0393\u03b2\u03b1 \u03b3 l \u03b2 e (\u03bc ) = 0 ,\n\n(95)\n\nwhere \u03c3 is an affine parameter along the light ray. Using definition of the Christoffel symbols (15) and changing parameter \u03c3 to\nthe proper time \u03c4 of the observer we recast (95) to\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0001\n1\n1\nd\n\u03b2\n\u03b3\ne\u03b1(\u03bc ) + h\u03b1\u03b2 e (\u03bc ) = \u03b7 \u03b1\u03bd \u2202\u03bd h\u03b3\u03b2 \u2212 \u2202\u03b3 h\u03bd\u03b2 k\u03b2 e (\u03bc ) .\n(96)\nd\u03c4\n2\n2\nThe propagation of the null vectors m\u03b1 and m\u0304\u03b1 along the direction of the null vector l \u03b1 is given by\ndm\u03b1\n+ \u0393\u03b2\u03b1 \u03b3 l \u03b2 m\u03b3 = 0 ,\nd\u03bb\nd m\u0304\u03b1\n+ \u0393\u03b2\u03b1 \u03b3 l \u03b2 m\u0304\u03b3 = 0 ,\nd\u03bb\n\n(97)\n(98)\n\nand the same laws are valid for n\u03b1 and l \u03b1 (see, for example, (14)). Equations (96)\u2013(98) are the main equations for the discussion\nof the rotation of the plane of polarization and variation of the Stokes parameters.\n\n\f24\nRelativistic description of polarized electromagnetic radiation\n\nWe consider propagation of a bundle of plane electromagnetic waves from the point of emission to the point of observation.\nEach of these waves have an electromagnetic tensor F\u03b1\u03b2 = F\u03b1\u03b2 + O(\u03b5 ) defined in the first approximation by equation [110, 111]\n\u0012 \u0013\ni\u03c6\n,\n(99)\nF\u03b1\u03b2 = a\u03b1\u03b2 exp\n\u03b5\n(100)\na\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03a6 m[\u03b1 l\u03b2 ] + \u03a6\u0304 m\u0304[\u03b1 l\u03b2 ]\nwhere \u03a6 is a complex scalar amplitude of the wave with a real and imaginary components which are independent of each other\n\u03b1\nin the most general case of incoherent radiation. In the proper frame of the observer with 4-velocity\n\u221a u the components of\nthe electric and magnetic field vectors are defined respectively as E \u03b1 = \u2212F \u03b1\u03b2 u\u03b2 and H \u03b1 = (\u22121/2 \u2212g)\u03b5 \u03b1\u03b2 \u03b3\u03b4 F\u03b3\u03b4 u\u03b2 [3]. The\nelectric field is a product of slowly-changing amplitude E\u03b1 = \u2212a\u03b1\u03b2 u\u03b2 and fast-oscillating phase exponent\n\u0012 \u0013\ni\u03c6\n.\n(101)\nE\u03b1 = E\u03b1 exp\n\u03b5\nThe polarization properties of electromagnetic radiation consisting of an ensemble of the waves with equal frequencies but\ndifferent phases are defined by the components of the electric field measured by observer. In the rest frame of the observer with\n4-velocity u\u03b1 , the intensity and polarization properties of the electromagnetic radiation are described in terms of the polarization\ntensor [1, 107]\nJ\u03b1\u03b2 =< E\u03b1 \u0112\u03b2 >=< E\u03b1 E \u0304\u03b2 > ,\n\n(102)\n\nwhere the angular brackets represent an average with respect to an ensemble of the electromagnetic waves with randomly\ndistributed phases. This averaging eliminates all fast-oscillating terms from J\u03b1\u03b2 . One has to notice [1] that the polarization\ntensor J\u03b1\u03b2 is symmetric only for a linearly polarized radiation. In all other cases, the polarization tensor is not symmetric. The\npolarization tensor J\u03b1\u03b2 is purely spatial at the point of observation which means it is orthogonal to the four-velocity of observer,\nJ\u03b1\u03b2 u\u03b2 . Furthermore, because the polarization tensor is defined in the sub-space of the polarization plane, it is orthogonal to the\nwave vector J\u03b1\u03b2 l \u03b2 = 0. This equality follows directly from its definition (102) and (9).\nThe vector amplitude E\u03b1 of the electric field can be decomposed in two independent components in the plane of polarization.\nTwo vectors of the null tetrad, m\u03b1 , m\u0304\u03b1 , form the circular-polarization basis, and vectors e\u03b1(1) , e\u03b1(2) form a linear polarization basis.\nThe decomposition reads\nE \u03b1 = EL m\u03b1 + ERm\u0304\u03b1 ,\nE \u03b1 = E(1) e\u03b1(1) + E(2)e\u03b1(2) ,\n\n(103)\n(104)\n\nwhere\n1\nEL = \u03c9 \u03a6\n2\n\n,\n\n1\nER = \u03c9 \u03a6\u0304 ,\n2\n\n(105)\n\nare left and right circularly-polarized components of the electric field,\n1\nE(1) = \u221a (EL + ER )\n2\n\n,\n\ni\nE(2) = \u221a (EL \u2212 ER) ,\n2\n\n(106)\n\nare linearly polarized components, \u03c9 = \u2212l\u03b1 u\u03b1 is the angular frequency of the electromagnetic wave, and we have taken into\naccount the condition of orthogonality (94).\nThere are for electromagnetic Stokes parameters S\u03b1 = (S0 , S1 , S2 , S3 ). They are defined by projecting the polarization tensor\nJ\u03b1\u03b2 on four independent combination of the tensor products of the two vectors, e\u03b1(1) , e\u03b1(2) making up the polarization plane.\nMore specifically, [107, 116]\ni\nh\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n(107)\nS0 = J\u03b1\u03b2 e\u03b1(1) e (1) + e\u03b1(2) e (2) ,\nh\ni\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\nS1 = J\u03b1\u03b2 e\u03b1(1) e (1) \u2212 e\u03b1(2) e (2) ,\n(108)\ni\nh\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n(109)\nS2 = J\u03b1\u03b2 e\u03b1(1) e (2) + e\u03b1(2) e (1) ,\nh\ni\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\nS3 = iJ\u03b1\u03b2 e\u03b1(1) e (2) \u2212 e\u03b1(2) e (1) ,\n(110)\n\n\f25\nwhere S0 \u2261 I is the intensity, S1 \u2261 Q and S2 \u2261 U characterize the degree of a linear polarization, and S3 \u2261 V is the degree of a\ncircular polarization of the electromagnetic wave.\nMaking use of equation (102) in (107)\u2013(110) allows us to represent the Stokes parameters in the linear polarization basis as\nfollows [107]\n< |E(1) |2 + |E(2)|2 > ,\n\n(111)\n\n< |E(1) | \u2212 |E(2)| > ,\n< E(1) E \u0304(2) + E \u0304(1) E(2) > ,\n\n(112)\n\nS3 = i < E(1) E \u0304(2) \u2212 E \u0304(1) E(2) > ,\n\n(114)\n\nS0 =\nS1 =\nS2 =\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(113)\n\nwhere E(n) = E\u03b1 e\u03b1(n) for n = 1, 2.\nIt is important to emphasize that though the Stokes parameters have four components, they do not form a 4-dimensional\nspacetime vector because they do not behave like a vector under transformations of the Lorentz group [1, 107]. Indeed, if we\nperform a pure Lorentz boost all four Stokes parameters remain invariant [1]. However, for a constant rotation of angle \u0398 in the\npolarization plane, the Stokes parameters transform as [1]\nS0\u2032\nS1\u2032\nS2\u2032\nS3\u2032\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nS0 ,\nS1 cos 2\u0398 + S2 sin 2\u0398 ,\nS1 cos 2\u0398 \u2212 S2 sin 2\u0398 ,\nS3 .\n\n(115)\n(116)\n(117)\n(118)\n\nThis is what would be expected for a spin-1/2 field. That is, under a duality rotation of \u0398 = \u03c0 /4, one linear polarization state\nturns into the other, while the circular polarization state remains the same. The transformation properties (115)\u2013(118) of the\nStokes parameters point out that the Stokes parameters S1 , S2 represent a linearly polarized components, and S3 represents a\ncircularly polarized component.\nThe polarization vector P = (P1 , P2 , P3 ) and the degree of polarization P = |P | of the electromagnetic radiation can be\ndefined in terms of the normalized Stokes parameters by P = (S1 /I, S2 /I, S3 /I). Any partially polarized wave may be thought\nof as an incoherent superposition of a completely polarized wave with the degree of polarization P and the polarization vector\nP , and a completely unpolarized wave with the degree of polarization 1 \u2212 P and nil polarization vector, P = 0, so that for\nan arbitrary polarized radiation one has: (S0 , S1 , S2 , S3 ) = I(P, P1 , P2 , P3 ) + I(1 \u2212 P, 0, 0, 0). For completely polarized waves,\nvector P describes the surface of the unit sphere introduced by Poincar\u00e9 [1]. The center of the Poincar\u00e9 sphere corresponds\nto an unpolarized radiation and the interior to a partially polarized radiation. Orthogonally polarized waves represent any two\nconjugate points on the Poincar\u00e9 sphere. In particular, (P1 = \u00b11, P2 = 0, P3 = 0), and (P1 = 0, P2 = 0, P3 = \u00b11) represent\northogonally polarized waves corresponding to the linear and circular polarization bases, respectively.\nPropagation law of the Stokes parameters\n\nTaking definition (100) of the electromagnetic tensor and accounting for the parallel transport of the null vectors l \u03b1 , m\u03b1 , m\u0304\u03b1\nalong the light ray and the laws of propagation of the electromagnetic tensor given by equations (16), yield the law of propagation\nof the complex scalar functions \u03a6 and \u03a6\u0304\nd\u03a6\n+\u03b8\u03a6 = 0 ,\nd\u03c3\nd \u03a6\u0304\n+ \u03b8 \u03a6\u0304 = 0 ,\nd\u03c3\n\n(119)\n(120)\n\nwhere \u03c3 is an affine parameter along the ray and \u03b8 is the expansion of the light-ray congruence defined in (17).\nLet us consider a sufficiently small, two-dimensional area A in the cross-section of the congruence of light rays lying on a\nnull hypersurface of constant phase \u03c6 that is in the polarization plane. The law of transportation of the cross-sectional area is\n[2, 71, 110]\ndA\n\u2212 2\u03b8 A = 0 .\nd\u03c3\nThus, the product, A |\u03a6|2 = A \u03a6\u03a6\u0304, remains constant along the congruence of light rays:\n\u0001\nl \u03b1 \u2207\u03b1 A |\u03a6|2 = 0 .\n\n(121)\n\n(122)\n\n\f26\nThis law of propagation for the product A |\u03a6|2 corresponds to the conservation of photon's flux [2, 71].\nThe law of conservation of the number of photons propagating along the light ray, corresponds to the propagation law of\nvector |\u03a6|2 l \u03b1 . Indeed, taking covariant divergence of this quantity and making use of the equations (119), (120) along with\ndefinition (17) for the expansion \u03b8 of the bundle of light rays, yields [2, 71]\n\u0001\n\u2207\u03b1 |\u03a6|2 l \u03b1 = 0 .\n(123)\n\nThis equation assumes that the scalar amplitude \u03a6 of the electromagnetic wave can be interpreted in terms of the number density,\nN , of photons in phase space and the energy of one photon, E\u03c9 = h\u0304\u03c9 , as follows\n|\u03a6| =\n\n\u0012 \u00131/2\n\u221a\nN\n8\u03c0 h\u0304\n,\nE\u03c9\n\n(124)\n\nwhere the reduced Planck constant h\u0304 = h/2\u03c0 and the normalizing factor were introduced for consistency between classical and\nquantum definitions of the energy of an electromagnetic wave [2].\nEach of the Stokes parameter is proportional to the square of frequency of light, \u03c9 = \u2212u\u03b1 l\u03b1 , as directly follows from equations\n(111)\u2013(114) and (106). Therefore, the variation of the Stokes parameters along the light ray can be obtained directly from their\ndefinitions (107)\u2013(110) along the light ray and making use of the laws of propagation (119), (120). However, the set of the Stokes\nparameters S\u03b1 (\u03b1 = 0, 1, 2, 3) is not directly observed in astronomy and we do not discuss their laws of propagation. Instead\nthe set of four other polarization parameters (F\u03c9 , P1 , P2 , P3 ) is practically measured [71, 117] and we focus on the discussion\nof the laws of propagation for these parameters. Here P = (P1 , P2 , P3 ) is the polarization vector as defined at the end of the\npreceding section, and F\u03c9 is the specific flux of radiation (also known as the monochromatic flux of a light source [117]) entering\na telescope from a given source. The specific flux is defined as an integral of the specific intensity (also known as the surface\nbrightness [117]) indexsurface brightness of the radiation, I\u03c9 \u2261 I\u03c9 (\u03c9 , l), over the total solid angle (assumed \u226a 4\u03c0 ) subtended\nby the source on the observer's sky:\nF\u03c9 =\n\nZ\n\nI\u03c9 (\u03c9 , l)d\u03a9(l\u0302) ,\n\n(125)\n\nwhere l\u0302 = (sin \u03b8\u0302 cos \u03c6\u0302 , sin \u03b8\u0302 sin \u03c6\u0302 , cos \u03b8\u0302 ) is the unit vector in the direction of the radiation flow and d \u03a9\u0302(l) = sin \u03b8\u0302 d \u03b8\u0302 d \u03c6\u0302 is the\nelement of the solid angle formed by light rays from the source and measured in the observer's local Lorentz frame.\nThe specific intensity I\u03c9 of radiation at a given frequency \u03c9 = 2\u03c0\u03bd , flowing in a given direction, l\u0302, as measured in a specific\nlocal Lorentz frame, is defined by\nI\u03c9 =\n\nd(energy)\n.\nd(time)d(area)d(frequency)d(solid angle)\n\n(126)\n\nA simple calculation (see, for instance, the problem 5.10 in [118]), reveals that\nN =\n\n8\u03c0 3 I\u03c9\n,\nh4 \u03c9 3\n\n(127)\n\nwhere h is the Planck's constant. The number density N is invariant along the light ray and does not change under the Lorentz\ntransformation. Invariance of N is a consequence of the kinetic equation for photons (radiative transfer equation) which in the\ncase of gravitational field and without any other scattering processes, assumes the following form [2]\ndN\n=0.\nd\u03bb\n\n(128)\n\nEquations (127), (128) tell us that the ratio I\u03c9 /\u03c9 3 is invariant along the light-ray trajectory, that is\nI\u03c9\n=\nI\u03c90\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c9\n\u03c90\n\n\u00133\n\n,\n\n(129)\n\nwhere \u03c90 , \u03c9 are frequency of light at the point of emission and observation respectively, I\u03c90 is the surface brightness of the\nsource of light at the point of emission, and I\u03c9 is the surface brightness of the source of light at the point of observation.\nEquations (119)\u2013(129) make it evident that in the geometric optics approximation the gravitational field does not mix up the\nlinear and circular polarizations of the electromagnetic radiation but can change its surface brightness I\u03c9 due to gravitational\n(and Doppler) shift of the light frequency caused by the time-dependent part of the gravitational field of the isolated system\nemitting gravitational waves. Furthermore, the monochromatic flux from the source of radiation changes due to the distortion\nof the domain of integration in equation (125) caused by the gravitational light-bending effect. Taking into account that the\n\n\f27\ngravitationally-unperturbed solid angle d\u03a9(k) = sin \u03b8 d \u03b8 d \u03c6 , and introducing the Jacobian, J(\u03b8 , \u03c6 ), of transformation between\nthe spherical coordinates (\u03b8\u0302 ,\u03c6\u0302 ) and (\u03b8 ,\u03c6 ) at the point of observation, one obtains that the measured monochromatic flux is\nF\u03c9 =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c6\n\nZ\n\nI\u03c90 (\u03b8 , \u03c6 )J(\u03b8 , \u03c6 )(\u03c9 /\u03c90 )3 sin \u03b8 d \u03b8 .\n\n(130)\n\nEquation (130) tells us that the monochromatic flux of the source of light can vary due to:\n1. the gravitational Doppler shift of the electromagnetic frequency of light when it travels from the point of emission to the\npoint of observation;\n2. the change in the solid angle at the point of observation caused by the gravitational light deflection. The \"magnification\"\nmatrix is the Jacobian of the transformation of the null directions on the celestial sphere generated by the bending of the\nlight-ray trajectories by the gravitational field of the isolated system.\nSpatial orientation of two components, P1 and P2 , of the polarization vector P at the point of observation differs from that taken\nat the point of emission of the electromagnetic wave due to the parallel transport of the polarization vector. The reference tetrad\nwith resepct to which the orientation of the polarization vector is measured is subject to the same law of the parallel transport.\nTherefore, in order to understand the change in the orientation of the polarization vector it is sufficient to consider the change in\nthe orientation of the reference tetrad as it propagates from the point of emission of light to the point of observation. The change\nin the polarization can be easily extracted then from the law of transformation of the Stokes parameters under the change of the\nreference tetrad. As we will see later in section VI D, only two vectors of the tetrad, e\u03b1(1) and e\u03b1(2) , will undergo the change in\ntheir orientation as they propagate along the light ray. Consequently, only two components of the polarization vector, P1 and\nP2 will change. This can be seen after taking into account equations (92), (93) where the rotational angle \u0398 is determined as a\nsolution of the parallel transport equation (96) for the reference tetrad (see section VI D). Thus, the gravitational field changes\nthe tilt angle of the polarization ellipse as light propagates along the light-ray trajectory. This gravitationally-induced rotation of\nthe polarization ellipse is called the Skrotskii effect [119, 120]. It was also predicted and discussed independently in [121, 122].\nIts observation would play a significant role for detection of gravitational waves of cosmological origin by CMBR-radiometry\nspace missions [38, 123]. The third component of the polarization vector, P3 , remains the same along the light-ray trajectory\nbecause it represents the circularly polarized component of the radiation and is not affected by the rotation of the reference tetrad\nas it propagates along the light-ray path.\nIV.\n\nMATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUE FOR ANALYTIC INTEGRATION OF LIGHT-RAY EQUATIONS\n\nThis section provides mathematical technique for performing integration of equations of propagation of various characteristics\nof electromagnetic wave from the point of emission of light x0 to the point of its observation x. It has been worked out in\n[6, 100, 103, 104]. The basic function, which is to be integrated, is the metric tensor perturbation, h\u03b1\u03b2 (t, x), generated by\nthe localized astronomical system and taken at the points lying on the light-ray trajectory. The metric tensor depends on the\nmultipole moments and/or their derivatives taken at the retarded instant of time s = t \u2212 r divided by the radial distance from\nthe system, r, taken to some power. The most difficult integrals are those taken from the functions like this, F(s)/r, with\nF(s) being a multipole moment of the gravitating system depending on the retarded time s. Calculation of the integrals goes\nslightly differently for stationary and non-stationary components of the metric tensor and these issues are treated in the next two\nsubsections.\nA.\n\nMonopole and dipole light-ray integrals\n\nThe monopole and dipole parts of the metric tensor perturbation (5)\u2013(8) are formed by terms being proportional to the mass\nM and spin S i of the isolated system. These terms are given in the solution of the light-ray equations by integrals [M (s)/r][\u22121] ,\n[M (s)/r][\u22122] and [S i (s)/r][\u22121] , [S i (s)/r][\u22122] . In this section we shall assume for simplicity that mass M and spin S i of the\nisolated system are constant during the time of propagation of light from the source of light to observer. The assumption of\nconstancy of the mass M and spin S i of the isolated system is valid as long as one neglects the energy emitted in the form\nof the gravitational waves by the isolated system under consideration. For light ray propagating from the sources at the edge\nof our visible universe (quasars) the characteristic interval of time of emission of gravitational waves by an isolated system is\ncomparable with the interval of time the light takes to travel from the point of emission to observer. In this case the time evolution\nof the mass-monopole and spin-dipole is to be taken into account for correct calculation of the perturbations of the trajectory of\nlight ray (see section V A for more detail). Mass and spin of the isolated system can also change due to a catastrophic disruption\nof the isolated system resulting in supernova explosion. Specific details of how this process affects the light-ray propagation are\nnot considered in the present chapter but, perhaps, are worthwhile to study.\n\n\f28\nIn the case when mass and spin are constant, the integrals that we need to carry out are reduced to [1/r][\u22121] and [1/r][\u22122] which\nare formally divergent at the lower limit of integration at the past null infinity when time t \u2192 \u2212\u221e. However, one must bear in\nmind that these integrals do not enter equations of light-ray geodesics (57) alone but appear in these equations after taking at\nleast one partial derivative with respect to either \u03be i or \u03c4 parameters. This differentiation effectively eliminates divergent parts of\nthe integrals from the final result. Hence, in what follows, we drop out the formally divergent terms so that the integrals under\ndiscussion assume the following form\n\u0014 \u0015[\u22121]\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ t\nZ\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c4\n1\nr(\u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03c4\n\u2261\n,\n= \u221a\n= \u2212 ln\nr\nrE\n\u2212\u221e r\nd2 + \u03c4 2\n\u0014 \u0015[\u22122]\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ t \u0014 \u0015[\u22121]\n1\nr(\u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03c4\n1\n\u2261\nd \u03c4 = \u2212\u03c4 ln\n\u2212 r(\u03c4 ) ,\nr\nrE\n\u2212\u221e r\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c4 = t \u2212 t \u2217 and we used equation (25) explicitly while expressing the distance r = rN (\u03c4 ) as a function of time \u03c4 . The\nconstant distance rE was introduced to make the argument of the logarithmic function dimensionless. This constant is not\nimportant for calculations as it always cancel out in final formulas. However, in the case of gravitational lensing it is convenient\nto identify the scale constant rE with the radius of the Einstein ring [71\u201373, 124]\nrE =\n\n\u0012\n\n4GM rr0\nc2 R\n\n\u00131/2\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere r, r0 are distances from the isolated system (the deflector of light) to observer and to the source of light respectively, and\nR = \u03c4 + \u03c40 . The radius of the Einstein ring is a characteristic distance separating naturally the case of weak gravitational lensing\n(d > rE ) from the strong lensing (d < rE ). The Einstein ring at the observer's point has the angular size given by\n\n\u03b8E =\n\nrE\n=\nr\n\n\u0012\n\n4GM r0\nc2 Rr\n\n\u00131/2\n\n.\n\n(4)\n\nThe angular radius \u03b8E defines the angular scale for a lensing situation. For example, in cosmology typical mass of an isolated\nsystem is M \u2243 1012M\u2299 and distances r, r0 , R are of the order of 1 Gpc (Gigaparsec). Consequently, the angular Einstein radius\n\u03b8E is of the order of one arcsecond, and the linear radius rE is of the order of 1 Kpc (Kiloparsec). A typical star within our galaxy\nhas mass M \u2243 M\u2299 and distances r, r0 , R are of the order 10 Kpc. It yields an angular Einstein radius \u03b8E of the order of one 1\u03bc as\n(one milli-arcsecond) and the linear radius rE is of the order of 10 au (10 astronomical units).\nB.\n\nLight-ray integrals from quadrupole and higher-order multipoles\n\nTime-dependent terms in the metric tensor (5) \u2013 (8) result from the multipole moments which can be either periodic (a binary\nsystem) or aperiodic (a supernova explosion) functions of time. The most straightforward way to calculate the impact of the gravitational field of such a source on the propagation of light would be to decompose its multipole moments F(s) := {IL (s), SL (s)}\nin the Fourier series [100]\n1\nF(t \u2212 r) = \u221a\n2\u03c0\n\nZ +\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\nF\u0303(\u03c9\u0303 )ei\u03c9\u0303 (t\u2212r) d \u03c9\u0303 ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c9\u0303 is a Fourier frequency, then to substitute this decomposition to the light-ray propagation equations and to integrate them\nterm by term. This method makes an impression that in order to obtain the final result of the integration the (complex-valued)\nFourier image F\u0303(\u03c9\u0303 ) of the multipole moments of the isolated system must be specified explicitly, otherwise neither explicit\nintegration nor the convolution of the integrated Fourier series will be possible. However, this impression is misleading, at least\nin general relativity. We shall show below that the explicit structure of F\u0303(\u03c9\u0303 ) is irrelevant for general-relativistic calculation of\nthe light-ray integrals. This may be understood better, if one recollects that in general relativity gravitational field propagates\nwith the same speed as light in vacuum. In alternative theories of gravity the speed of gravity and light may be different [125], so\nit can lead to the appearance of terms being proportional to the difference between the speed of gravity and the speed of light that\nwill drastically complicates calculations which will do require to know the explicit form of the Fourier images of gravitationalwave sources as functions of \u03c9\u0303 . All such terms, which might depend on the difference between the speed of gravity and the\nspeed of light are cancelled out in general relativity, thus, making integration of the light ray propagation equations manageable\nand applicable for any source of gravitational waves without particular specification of its temporal behaviour. It may be worth\nmentioning that the experimental limit on the difference between the speed of gravity and the speed of light in general relativity\ncan be measured in the solar system experiments with major planets as predicted in [126]. It was experimentally tested with the\n\n\f29\nprecision 20% in the jovian light-ray deflection experiment with VLBI network [127]. No deviation from general relativity was\ndetected.\nWe notice that the integration of the light-ray equations is effectively reduced to the calculation of only two types of integrals\nalong the light ray: [F(s)/r][\u22121] and [F(s)/r][\u22122] , where F(s) = F(t \u2212 r) denotes any type of the time-dependent multipole\nmoments of the gravitational field of the localized astronomical system. These integrals can be performed after introducing a\nnew variable [100]\np\n(6)\ny \u2261 s \u2212 t \u2217 = \u03c4 \u2212 r(\u03c4 ) = \u03c4 \u2212 d 2 + \u03c4 2 ,\n\nwhich is the interval of time between two spacetime events: position of photon x\u03b1 = (\u03c4 , x) on the light ray and that of the center\nof mass of the isolated system z\u03b1 = (y, 0) taken at the retarded time y [148]. Equation (6) is a retarded solution of the null cone\nequation in flat spacetime\n\n\u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 (x\u03b1 \u2212 z\u03b1 )(x\u03b2 \u2212 z\u03b2 ) = 0 ,\n\n(7)\n\ngiving the time of propagation of gravity from the isolated system to the photon along the null cone characteristic of Einstein's\nequations. This retardation of gravity effect presents in the time argument of the solution (5)\u2013(8) of the linearized Einstein\nequations. The replacement of the time argument \u03c4 with the retarded time y = \u03c4 \u2212 r(\u03c4 ) allows us to perform integration of\nequations of light-ray geodesics completely without making specific assumptions about the time dependence of the multipole\nmoments. It is worth noting that while the parameter \u03c4 runs from \u2212\u221e to +\u221e, the retarded time y runs from \u2212\u221e to 0, that is, y is\nalways negative, y \u2264 0.\nEquation (6) leads to other useful transformations\n\n\u03c4=\n\ny2 \u2212 d 2\n,\n2y\n\np\n1 d 2 + y2\nd2 + \u03c4 2 = \u2212\n,\n2 y\n\n(8)\n\n1 d 2 + y2\ndy .\n2 y2\n\n(9)\n\nand\nd\u03c4 =\n\nMaking use of the new variable y and relationships (8), (9) the integrals under discussion can be explicitly displayed as follows:\n\u0014\n\nF(t \u2212 r)\nr\n\n\u0015[\u22121]\n\n= \u2212\n\nZy\n\n\u0014\n\nF(t \u2212 r)\nr\n\n\u0015[\u22122]\n\n= \u2212\n\n1\n2\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nF(t \u2217 + \u03b6 )\nd\u03b6 ,\n\u03b6\n\nZy Z\u03b7\n\n\u2212\u221e \u2212\u221e\n\nd2\nF(t \u2217 + \u03b6 )\nd\u03b6 d\u03b7 \u2212\n\u03b6\n2\n\n(10)\nZy\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n1\n\u03b72\n\nZ\u03b7\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nF(t \u2217 + \u03b6 )\nd\u03b6 d\u03b7 ,\n\u03b6\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03b6 , \u03b7 are the dummy variables of the integration replacing the integration along the light-ray trajectory by that along a\nnull characteristic of the gravitational field, and t \u2217 is the time of the closest approach of photon to the origin of the coordinate\nchart coinciding with the center of mass of the isolated gravitational system. The time t \u2217 has no physical meaning in the most\ngeneral case and appears in calculations as an auxiliary (constant) parameter which vanishes in the final result. The reason is\nsimple, by choosing the origin of the coordinate chart at a different point we change the numerical value of t \u2217 but it cannot\nchange physical observables \u2013 the angle of light-ray deflection, frequency shift, etc. The time of the closest approach t \u2217 can\nbe used as an approximation of the retarded time s = t \u2212 r in the case of a small impact parameter d of the light ray with\nrespect to the isolated astronomical system, that is s \u2243 t \u2217 + O(d 2 /cr) (see equation (6)). This approximation makes an erroneous\nimpression that the physical effect of propagation of gravity is unimportant for calculation of observable effects caused by\nvariable gravitational field of the isolated system. This misinterpretation of the role of gravity's propagation in the interpretation\nof the observable astronomical effects did happen in some papers [53, 128] which used the simplifying approximation s = t \u2217\nfrom the very beginning of calculations but it precludes to spatially disentangle the null cone characteristics of gravity and light.\nThe only case when the time t \u2217 makes physical sense is when observer is located in infinity. Indeed, in this case the radial\ndistance r = \u221e, and the retarded time s = t \u2217 exactly, because the residual terms O(d 2 /r) = 0 irrespectively of the choice of the\ncoordinate origin [99].\nA remarkable property of the integrals in the right side of equations (10), (11) is that\u221a\nthey depend on the parameters \u03be i and\n\u03c4 only through either the upper limit of the integration, which is the variable y = \u03c4 \u2212 d 2 + \u03c4 2 , or the square of the impact\nparameter, d 2 = (\u03be * \u03be) standing in front of the second integral in the right side of equation (11). For this reason, differentiation\n\n\f30\nof the integrals in the left part of equations (10), (11) with respect to either \u03be i or \u03c4 will effectively eliminate the integration along\nthe light ray trajectory. For example,\n(\u0014\n\u0015[\u22121] )\nF(t \u2217 + y) \u02c6\nF(t\n\u2212\nr)\n\u03bei\n=\u2212\n(12)\n\u2202\u02c6i\n\u2202i y = F(t \u2212 r) .\nr\ny\nyr\nSimilar calculation can be easily performed in case of differentiation of integral [F(t \u2212 r)/r][\u22121] with respect to \u03c4 . It results in\n(\u0014\n\u0015[\u22121] )\nF(t \u2217 + y) \u02c6\nF(t\n\u2212\nr)\n\u03c4 \u0011 F(t \u2212 r)\nF(t \u2217 + y) \u0010\n=\u2212\n,\n(13)\n1\u2212\n=\n\u2202\u02c6\u03c4\n\u2202\u03c4 y = \u2212\nr\ny\ny\nr\nr\nas it could be expected because the partial differentiation with respect to \u03c4 keeps \u03be i and t \u2217 fixed and, hence, is equivalent to\ntaking a total time derivative with respect to t along the light ray. Since all terms in the solution of the light geodesic equation are\nrepresented as partial derivatives from the integrals [F(t \u2212 r)/r][\u22121] and [F(t \u2212 r)/r][\u22122] with respect to the parameters \u03be i and/or\n\u03c4 , it is clear from equations (12), (13) that the solution will not contain any single integral like [F(t \u2212 r)/r][\u22121] at all \u2013 only the\nderivatives of this integral will appear which are ordinary functions.\nDealing with the double integrals of type [F(t \u2212 r)/r][\u22122] is more sophisticated. We notice that taking the first and second\nderivatives from the double integral [F(t \u2212 r)/r][\u22122] do not eliminate the integration along the light ray trajectory\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\n(\u0014\n\u0015[\u22122] )\n\u0014\n\u0015[\u22121] Zy\nZ\u03b7\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f2\n\u2217\nF(t \u2212 r)\n1\nF(t + \u03b6 )\n1 F(t \u2212 r)\n\u2202\u02c6k\nd\n\u03b6\nd\n\u03b7\n,\n(14)\n= \u03bek\n\u2212\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f3y\nr\nr\n\u03b72\n\u03b6\n\u2212\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n(\u0014\n\u0015 )\n\u03be k \u03be j F(t \u2212 r)\nF(t \u2212 r) [\u22122]\n\u02c6\u2202 jk\n=\n(15)\nr\ny2\nr\n\uf8f1\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f2 1 \u0014 F(t \u2212 r) \u0015[\u22121] Zy 1 Z\u03b7 F(t \u2217 + \u03b6 )\n\uf8fd\n+ P jk\n,\nd\n\u03b6\nd\n\u03b7\n\u2212\n\uf8f3y\n\uf8fe\nr\n\u03b72\n\u03b6\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nHowever, taking one more (a third) derivative eliminates all integrals from equation (15) completely.

The same kind of reasoning works for the third derivatives with respect to the parameter \u03c4 and to\nthe mixed derivatives taken with respect to both \u03be i and \u03c4 .\nWe shall obtain solution of the light geodesic in terms of (STF) partial derivatives taken with respect to the impact parameter\nvector, \u03be i , of the light ray acting on the single and double integrals having a symbolic form \u2202\u02c6<a1 ...ak > [F(t \u2212 r)/r][\u22121] and\n\u2202\u02c6<a1 ...ak > [F(t \u2212 r)/r][\u22122] where the angular brackets around the spatial indices indicate the STF symmetry. Explicit expression\nfor this STF derivative can be obtained directly by applying the differentiation rules shown in equations (14) \u2013 (16). In what\nfollows, we shall see that the solution of the equations of propagation of light rays will always contain three or more derivatives\nacting on the integrals from the higher-order multipole moments (with the multipole index l \u2265 2) which have the same structure\nas that shown in equations (10), (11). It means that the final result of the integration of the light-ray propagation equations\ndepending on the higher-order multipoles of the localized astronomical system can be expressed completely solely in terms of\nthese multipoles taken at the retarded instant of time s = t \u2212 r. In other words, the observed effects of light deflection, etc. does\nnot depend in general relativity directly on the past history of photon's propagation that is the effects of temporal variations of\nthe gravitational field (gravitational waves) do not accumulate. On the other hand, the past history of the isolated system can\n\n\f31\naffect the propagation of light ray, at least in principle, through the tails of the gravitational waves which contribute to the present\nvalue of multipole moments of the system as shown in equations (12), (13).\nWe would like to point out that if an electromagentic wave propagated through a dispersive medium, the physical speed\nof light would be different from the speed of gravity. In such case the effects of the temporal variations of the gravitational\nfield can do accumulate and the motion of the electromagnetic signal depends on its past history. This effect was studied by\nBertotti and Catenacci [129] in order to set an upper limit on the light scintillations caused by the stochastic gravitational wave\nbackground. They concluded that such a limit is not very interesting but it might be a good time now to reconsider this conclusion\nin application to the more advanced level of observational technologies..\nV.\n\nGRAVITATIONAL PERTURBATIONS OF THE LIGHT RAY\nA. Relativistic perturbation of the electromagnetic eikonal\n\nPerturbation of eikonal (phase) of electromagnetic signal propagating from the point x0 to the point x are obtained by solving\nequation (38). This solution is found by integrating the metric tensor perturbation along the light-ray trajectory and can be\nwritten down in the linearized approximation as an algebraic sum of three separate terms\n\n\u03c8 = \u03c8(G) + \u03c8(M) + \u03c8(S) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c8(G) represents the gauge-dependent part of the eikonal, and \u03c8(M) , \u03c8(S) are eikonal's perturbations caused by the mass and\nspin multipole moments correspondingly. Their explicit expressions are as follows\n\n\u03c8(G) = (ki \u03c6 i \u2212 \u03c6 0 ) + (ki wi \u2212 w0 ) ,\n\u03c8(M)\n\n(2)\n\n\u0015\n\u0010\n\u221e l\u22121\n(\u22121)l+p\np\u0011\nM (t \u2212 r) [\u22121]\n+2\u2211 \u2211\n= 2\nCl (l \u2212 p, p) 1 \u2212\nr\nl!\nl\nl=2 p=0\n\uf8f1\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9[\u22121]\n\uf8f4\n\u0013\n(p)\n\uf8f2\u0012\nIAl (t \u2212 r)\np\n\uf8fb\n\u00d7\n1+\nk<a1 ...a p \u2202\u02c6a p+1 ...al > \uf8f0\n\uf8f4\nl\u22121\nr\n\uf8f3\n\u0014\n\n\u2212\n\n\uf8ee\n\n2p\nk<a1 ...a p\u22121 \u2202\u02c6a p ...al\u22121 > \uf8f0\nl\u22121\n\n(p)\nki IiAl\u22121 (t \u2212 r)\n\nr\n\n\u221e l\u22121\n\n\uf8f9[\u22121] \uf8fc\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n\n(\u22121)l+p l\nCl\u22121 (l \u2212 p \u2212 1, p)\n\u2211\nl=2 p=0 (l + 1)!\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9[\u22121]\n(p)\n\u0013\n\u0012\nki \u03b5iba SbAl\u22121 (t \u2212 r)\np\n\uf8fb\nk<a1 ...a p \u2202\u02c6a p+1 ...al\u22121> \uf8f0\n,\n\u00d7 1\u2212\nl\u22121\nr\n\n\u03c8(S) = 2\u03b5abi ka S b \u2202\u02c6i ln (r \u2212 \u03c4 ) + 4\u2202\u02c6a \u2211\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere H(p \u2212 q) is the Heaviside function defined by the expression (21), Cl (p, q) are the polynomial coefficient given by\nequation (20) and F (p) (t \u2212 r) denotes \u2202 p F(t \u2212 r)/\u2202 t p where r is considered as constant.\nWe note that the gauge-dependent part of the eikonal, \u03c8(G) , contains combination of terms ki \u03c6 i \u2212 \u03c6 0 defined by equations\n(71)\u2013(73) which can be, in principle, eliminated with an appropriate choice of the gravitational field gauge functions w0 and wi .\nHowever, such a procedure will introduce a reference frame in the sky with a coordinate grid being dependent on the direction\nto the source of light rays that is, to the direcion of the unit vector ki . The coordinate frame obtained in this way will have\nthe direction-dependent distortions which can change as time goes on because of the proper motion of stars. For this reason\nthe elimination of functions \u03c6 0 and \u03c6 i from equation (2) may be not practically justified. The ADM-harmonic coordinate chart\nadmits a more straightforward treatment of observable relativistic effects. Thus, we leave the gauge functions \u03c6 0 and \u03c6 i in\nequation (2) along with the gauge functions w0 and wi that are defined by formulas (66), (67).\nExpressions (3), (4) for the eikonal contain derivatives from the retarded integrals of the mass- and spin-multipoles. After\ntaking the derivatives one can prove that the integrals from all high-order multipoles (l \u2265 2) are eliminated. Indeed, scrutiny\ninspection of equations (3), (4) elucidates that all the integrals from the multipole moments enter the equation in combination\nwith at least one derivative with respect to the impact parameter vector \u03be i . Hence, the differentiation rule (12) is applied which\neliminates the integration.\n\n\f32\nThe only integral which must be performed, is that from the mass monopole in equation (3). It can be taken by parts as follows\n\u0014\n\nM (t \u2212 r)\nr\n\n\u0015[\u22121]\n\n= \u2212M (t \u2212 r) ln(r \u2212 \u03c4 ) +\n\nZ y\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nM \u0307(t \u2217 + \u03b6 ) ln \u03b6 d \u03b6 ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere M \u0307 \u2261 \u2202 M /\u2202 t \u2217 . If one assumes that the mass M is constant, then the second term in the right side of equation (5)\nvanishes and the eikonal does not contain any integral dependence on the past history of the light propagation. This assumption\nis usually implied, for example, in the theory of gravitational lensing [71\u201373] and other applications of the relativistic theory of\nlight propagation. Here, we extend our approach to take into account the case of time-dependent mass of the isolated system,\nM \u0307 6= 0. The mass may change because stars are losing mass in the form of the stellar wind. We shall not consider this case but\nfocus on another process of the lost of mass by the isolated system due to the emission of gravitational radiation. The rate of the\nmass loss is, then, given by [1, 2]\n\u0001\n1 (3)\n(3)\nM \u0307(t) = \u2212 7 Ii j (t)Ii j (t) + O c\u22129 ,\nc\n\n(6)\n\n\u0001\n(3)\nwhere Ii j represents a third time derivative from the mass quadrupole moment and terms of order O c\u22129 describe contribution\nof higher-order mass and spin multipoles which we neglect here. Making use of equation (6) in (5) yields\n\u0014\n\nM (t \u2212 r)\nr\n\n\u0015[\u22121]\n\n= \u2212M (t \u2212 r) ln(r \u2212 \u03c4 )\n\u2212\n\n1\nc7\n\nZ y\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(7)\n\n\u0001\n(3)\n(3)\nIi j (t \u2217 + \u03b6 )Ii j (t \u2217 + \u03b6 ) ln \u03b6 d \u03b6 + O c\u22129 .\n\nIt is instructive to evaluate contribution of the second term in the right side of equation (5) in the case of light propagating\nin gravitational field of a binary system consisting of two stars with masses m1 and m2 orbiting each other on a circular orbit.\nThe total mass M of the system is defined in accordance with equation (10) (for l = 0) which takes into account the first\npost-Newtonian correction\nM (t) = m1 + m2 \u2212\n\n\u0001\n1 \u03bcM\n+ O c\u22124 ,\n2\n2c a(t)\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03bc = m1 m2 /M is the reduced mass of the system and a = a(t) is the orbital radius of the system. Assuming that the lost\nof the orbital energy is due to the emission of gravitational waves from the system in accordance with the quadrupole formula\napproximation (6), the time evolution of the orbital radius is defined by equation [1, 2]\n\u0227 = \u2212\n\n64 \u03bc M 2\n.\n5c5 a3\n\n(9)\n\nIt has a simple solution [2]\n\u0010\n\u03c4 \u00111/4\n,\na(t) = a0 1 \u2212\nT\nT =\n\n5c5 a40\n,\n256 \u03bc M 2\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03c4 = t \u2212 t \u2217, t \u2217 is the time of the closest approach of light ray to the binary system, a0 = a(t \u2217 ) is the orbital radius of the\nbinary system at the time of the closest approach, and T is the spiral time of the binary. The lost of the total mass due to the\nemission of the gravitational waves is\n1 \u03bcM \u0010\n\u03c4 \u0011\u22125/4\nM \u0307 = \u2212 2\n1\u2212\n.\n8c a0 T\nT\n\n(12)\n\nSubstituting equation (12) to the right side of equation (5) and performing integration yields\n1 \u03bcM\nM \u0307(t \u2217 + \u03b6 ) ln \u03b6 d \u03b6 = \u2212 2\nln(r \u2212 \u03c4 )\n2 c a(s)\n\u2212\u221e\n( \u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015)\n1 m1 m2\na(s) \u2212 a0\na(s)\n+ 2 arctan\nln\n,\n+\n2 c2 a 0\na(s) + a0\na0\n\nZ y\n\n(13)\n\n\f33\nwhere a(s) \u2261 a(t \u2212 r) denotes the orbital radius of the binary system taken at the retarded time s = t \u2212 r. Putting all terms in\nequations (5), (8), (13) together yields\n( \u0014\n\u0015\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015)\n\u0014\na(s) \u2212 a0\na(s)\nM (t \u2212 r) [\u22121]\n1 m1 m2\n= \u2212(m1 + m2 ) ln(r \u2212 \u03c4 ) +\nln\n+ 2 arctan\n,\n(14)\nr\n2 c2 a 0\na(s) + a0\na0\nwhere the first term in the right side of this equation is the standard Shapiro time delay in the gravitational field of the binary system with constant total mass m1 + m2 , and the second term represents relativistic correction due to the emission of gravitational\nwaves by the system causing the overall loss of its orbital energy.\nEikonal describes propagation of a wave front of the electromagnetic wave. Light rays are orthogonal to the wave front and\ntheir trajectories can be easily calculated as soon as the eikonal is known. In the present chapter we do not use this technique\nand obtain solution for the light rays directly from the light-ray geodesic equations that gives identical results.\nB.

In section IV we have shown that taking a derivative from an integral\n[F(s)/r][\u22121] reduces the integral to an ordinary function of the retarded time s with no integral dependence on the past history\nof the propagation of light ray. In order to eliminate the integration in integrals [F(s)/r][\u22122] one needs to take three or more\nderivatives. One can notice that in (27), (28) there are terms with the summation index p = l \u2212 1 or p = l in which the number\nof the derivatives is less than three that is not sufficient to eliminate the integrals. However, all such integrals are multiplied with\na numerical coefficients like 1 \u2212 p/l, etc. which gets nil for those values of the summation index p. It effectively eliminates all\nthe integrals in (27), (28) in which the integration cannot be eliminated by the partial derivatives. As an example let us examine\nh\ni[\u22122]\n(p\u2212q)\nequation (27) for \u039ei (\u03c4 , \u03be). In this expression the term with the double integral I\n(s)/r\nhas l \u2212 p + 1 derivatives \u2202\u02c6a and\n(M)\n\nAl\n\nh\ni[\u22122]\n(p\u2212q)\n(s)/r\ncan contain the explicit\nq derivatives \u2202\u02c6\u03c4 . After performing the differentiation, the expression \u2202\u02c6<a1 ...al\u2212p+1> \u2202\u02c6\u03c4q IAl\n\n\f36\nintegrals in the following cases: q = 0 and p = l \u2212 1; q = 0 and p = l; q = 1 and p = l. However, these integrals are multiplied\nwith [1 \u2212 (p \u2212 q)/l][1 \u2212 (p \u2212 q)/(l \u2212 1)] and in any case of p and q values mentioned above either the factor 1 \u2212 (p \u2212 q)/l or\n1 \u2212 (p \u2212 q)/(l \u2212 1) will vanish. Similar reasoning is applied to the spin-dependent perturbation \u039ei (\u03c4 , \u03be) which shows that there\n(S)\n\nis no need to explicitly integrate the spin multipole moments in order to calculate the perturbation of light ray trajectory.\nThe only integral dependence of the light-ray trajectory perturbation depending on the past history of the propagating photon\nremains in equation (26) which contains the gauge functions \u03c6 \u03b1 and w\u03b1 used later in this chapter for interpretation of observable\neffects caused by the gravitational waves from the isolated system. The past-history dependence of the light-ray trajectory may\ncome into play also through the integrals from mass monopole and spin-dipole terms: [M /r][\u22122] and [S /r][\u22122] , if mass and/or\nspin of the isolated system are not conserved and change as time passes on. The non-conservation can be caused, for example,\nby emission of gravitational waves carrying away the orbital energy and angular momentum of the system. The past-history\ncontribution of these integrals can be calculated similarly to the eikonal perturbation considered in equations (6)\u2013(14).\nSolution of the light-ray equation with the initial-boundary conditions (18) depends on the unit vector k defining direction\nof the light-ray propagation extrapolated backward in time to the past null infinity. In real practice the light ray is emitted at\nthe point x0 where the source of light is located at time t0 , and it arrives to observer at time t to the point x separated from the\nsource of light by a finite coordinate distance R = |x \u2212 x0 |. Therefore, solution of the light-ray equations must be expressed in\nthis case in terms of the integrals of the boundary-value problem. It is formulated in terms of the coordinates of the initial, x0 ,\nand the final, x, positions of the photon\nx(t) = x ,\n\nx(t0 ) = x0 ,\n\n(29)\n\nand a unit vector\nKi = \u2212\n\nxi \u2212 xi0\n,\n|x \u2212 x0|\n\n(30)\n\nthat defines a coordinate direction from the observer towards the source of light and can be interpreted as a unit vector in the\nEuclidean space in the sense that \u03b4i j K i K j = 1.\nIn what follows it is convenient to make use of the astronomical coordinates x \u2261 xi = (x1 , x2 , x3 ) based on a triad of the\nEuclidean unit vectors (I0 , J0 , K0 ) as shown in Fig. 2. Vector K0 points from observer towards the isolated system emitting\ngravitational waves and deflecting light rays. Vectors I0 and J0 lie in the plane being orthogonal to vector K0 . The unit vector\nI0 is directed to the east, and that J0 points towards the north celestial pole . The origin of the coordinate system is chosen to lie\nat the center of mass of the isolated system.\nWe will need in our discussion an another reference frame based on a triad of the Euclidean unit vectors (I, J, K) that are\nturned at some angle with respect to vectors (I0 , J0 , K0 ). Vector K points from the observer towards the source of light, and\nvectors I and J lie in the plane of the sky defined to be orthogonal to vector K. Mutual orientation of the triads is defined by\nthe orthogonal transformation (rigid rotation)\nI0 = I cos \u03a9 + J sin \u03a9 ,\nJ0 = \u2212I cos \u03b8 sin \u03a9 + J cos \u03b8 cos\u03a9 + K sin \u03b8 ,\nK0 = I sin \u03b8 sin \u03a9 \u2212 J sin \u03b8 cos \u03a9 + K cos \u03b8 ,\n\n(31)\n(32)\n(33)\n\nwhere the rotational angles, \u03a9 and \u03b8 , are constant.\nIt is rather straightforward to obtain solution of the boundary value problem (29) for light propagation in terms of the unit\nvector K instead of the unit vector k of the initial-boundary value problem. All what we need, is to convert the unit vector k to\nK written in terms of spatial coordinates of the points of emission, x0 , and observation, x, of the light ray. From formula (24)\none has\nki = \u2212K i \u2212 \u03b2 i (\u03c4 , \u03be) ,\n\n(34)\n\nwhere the relativistic correction \u03b2 i (\u03c4 , \u03be) to the vector K i is derived from the solution of the initial-boundary value problem, It is\nexplicitly defined as follows\n\u0015\n\u0014\nj\nj\nj\ni\nP j \u2206 \u039e +\u2206 \u039e +\u2206 \u039e\n(G)\n(M)\n(S)\n\u03b2 i (\u03c4 , \u03be) =\n,\n(35)\n|x \u2212 x0|\nwith Pij = \u03b4 ij \u2212 ki k j being the operator of projection on the plane being orthogonal to vector ki . Denominator of equation (35)\ncontains the distance R = |x \u2212 x0 | between observer and source of light which can be very large, thus, making an impression\nthat the relativistic correction \u03b2 i (\u03c4 , \u03be) is probably negligibly small. However, the difference \u2206\u039e j (\u03c4 , \u03be) in the numerator of (35)\n\n\f37\nis proportional either to the distance r = |x| between the observer and the isolated system or to the distance r0 = |x0 | between\nthe source of light and the isolated system. Either one of them or both distances can be comparable with R so that the relativistic\ncorrection \u03b2 i (\u03c4 , \u03be) cannot be neglected in general case, and must be taken into account for calculation of relativistic perturbations\nof light-ray trajectory. Only in a case where observer and source of light reside at extremely large distances on opposite sides of\nthe source of gravitational waves can the relativistic correction \u03b2 i be neglected.\nVI.\n\nOBSERVABLE RELATIVISTIC EFFECTS\n\nIn this section we derive general expressions for four observable relativistic effects \u2013 the time delay, the light bending, the\nfrequency shift, and the rotation of the polarization plane.\nA. Gravitational time delay of light\n\nRelativistic time delay for light propagating through time-dependent gravitational field can be obtained either directly from\nexpression (24) or from the electromagnetic eikonal (35), (1) by observing that the eikonal is constant not only on the null\nhypersurface of the wave front of electromagnetic wave but also along the light rays citepfrolov. Both derivations lead, of\ncourse, to the same result\nt \u2212 t0 = |x \u2212 x0| + \u2206(\u03c4 , \u03c40 ) ,\n\u2206(\u03c4 , \u03c40 ) = \u2206 (\u03c4 , \u03c40 ) + \u2206 (\u03c4 , \u03c40 ) + \u2206 (\u03c4 , \u03c40 ) ,\n(G)\n\n(M)\n\n(S)\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nwhere x\u03b10 = (t0 , x0 ) are four-coordinates of the point of emission of light, x\u03b1 = (t, x) are four-coordinates of the point of\nobservation, \u2206 (\u03c4 , \u03c40 ), \u2206 (\u03c4 , \u03c40 ) and \u2206 (\u03c4 , \u03c40 ) are functions describing correspondingly the delay of the electromagnetic signal\n(G)\n\n(M)\n\n(S)\n\ndue to the gauge-freedom, mass and spin multipoles of the gravitational field of the isolated system. These functions are\nexpressed as follows\n\u0014\n\u0015\ni\ni\n(3)\n\u2206 (\u03c4 , \u03c40 ) = \u2212ki \u039e (\u03c4 , \u03be) \u2212 \u039e (\u03c40 , \u03be) ,\n(G)\n(G)\n(G)\n\u0015\n\u0014\n(4)\n\u2206 (\u03c4 , \u03c40 ) = \u2212ki \u039ei (\u03c4 , \u03be) \u2212 \u039ei (\u03c40 , \u03be) ,\n(M)\n(M)\n(M)\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2206 (\u03c4 , \u03c40 ) = \u2212ki \u039ei (\u03c4 , \u03be) \u2212 \u039ei (\u03c40 , \u03be) .\n(5)\n(S)\n\n(S)\n\n(S)\n\nThere exists a relation between the relativistic perturbations of the eikonal and the light-ray trajectory\n\n\u03c8 (\u03c4 , \u03be) = \u2212ki \u039ei (\u03c4 , \u03be) ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the eikonal perturbation, \u03c8 , reads off the equations (1)\u2013(4). From equations (3)\u2013(5) one can infer that in the linear\napproximation the functions describing the time delay are just the projections of vector functions describing the coordinate\nperturbation of the light-ray trajectory onto the unperturbed direction ki from the source of light to the observer.\nEquation (1) defines the light time delay effect in the global time t of the ADM-harmonic reference frame. In order to convert\nit to observable proper time T of the observer, we assume for simplicity that the observer is in a state of free fall and moves with\nvelocity V i with respect to the reference frame of the isolated system. Transformation from the ADM-harmonic coordinate time\nt to the proper time T is made with the help of the standard formula [1, 2]\ndT 2 = \u2212g\u03b1\u03b2 dx\u03b1 dx\u03b2 .\n\n(7)\n\nSubstituting the metric tensor expansion g\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 + h\u03b1\u03b2 , where h\u03b1\u03b2 is given by equations (21)\u2013(24), to equation (7) yields\nq\ndT\ni j\n=\n1 \u2212 V 2 \u2212 h00 (1 + V 2 ) \u2212 2h0iV i \u2212 hTT\nij V V .\ndt\n\n(8)\n\nIn the most simple case, when observer is at rest (V = 0) with respect to the ADM-harmonic reference frame equation (8) is\ndrastically simplified and depends only on h00 component of the metric tensor. Implementation of formula (21) for h00 and\nsubsequent integration of (8) with respect to time yields then\n\n\f38\nT =\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nM\n(t \u2212 ti ) ,\n1\u2212\nr\n\n(9)\n\nwhere ti is the initial epoch of observation. Another simple case of equation (8) is obtained for observer located at the distance\nr so large that one can neglect h00 and h0i quasi-static perturbations of the metric tensor. Then, the difference between the\nobserver's proper time T and coordinate time t is\n\nleading in the case of a small velocity to\n\nq\ndT\n1 \u2212 V 2 \u2212 hTi jT V iV j ,\n=\ndt\nZ t\np\nV iV j\n2\n\u221a\nhTi jT dt .\nT =\n1 \u2212 V (t \u2212 ti ) \u2212\n1 \u2212 V 2 ti\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\nThe last term in the right side of this equation describes the effect of the gravitational waves on the rate of the proper time of\nobserver which may be important under some specific circumstances but is enormously small in real practice and, as a rule, can\nbe neglected. Nonetheless, it would be interesting to study this effect in more detail as a possible tool to detect gravitational\nwaves emitted, for example, in galactic supernova explosions or by powerful gamma-ray bursts (GRB) in distant galaxies.\n\nB. Gravitational deflection of light\n\nThe coordinate direction to a source of light measured at the point of observation x is defined by the spatial components of\nfour-vector of photon l \u03b1 incoming to an observer from the source of light. This vector depends on the energy (frequency) of\nphoton which is irrelevant for the present section. Normalization of l \u03b1 to its frequency eliminates the frequency-dependence and\nbrings about a four-vector p\u03b1 = (1, pi ) where pi = \u2212\u1e8bi and the dot denotes derivative with respect to coordinate time t. Vector\n\u03c6 a is null, p\u03b1 p\u03b1 = 0, and is only direction-dependent. The spatial part of this vector can be presented as a small deviation from\nthe direction ki of the unperturbed photon's trajectory\npi = \u2212ki \u2212 \u039e\u0307i ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere the minus sign indicates that the tangent vector pi is directed from the observer to the source of light.\nThe coordinate direction pi is not a directly observable quantity as it is defined with respect to the chosen coordinate grid on\nthe curved spacetime manifold. A real observable vector towards the source of light, s\u03b1 = (1, si ), is defined with respect to the\nlocal inertial frame co-moving with the observer [130]. In this frame si = \u2212dX i /dT , where T is the observer's proper time, and\nX i are the spatial coordinates of the local inertial frame with the observer at its origin. We shall assume for simplicity that the\nobserver is at rest with respect to the global ADM-harmonic coordinates (t, xi ). The case of an observer moving with respect to\nthe ADM-harmonic system with velocity V i can be treated with the help of the Lorentz transformation which is a straightforward\nprocedure so that we do not discuss it. In case of a static observer, transformation from the global ADM-harmonic coordinates\n(t, xi ) to the local coordinates (T, X i ) is given by the formulas\ndT = \u039b00 dt + \u039b0j dx j\n\n,\n\ndX i = \u039bi0 dt + \u039bi j dx j ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere the matrix of transformation \u039b\u03b2\u03b1 is defined by the requirements of orthonormality\n\u03bc\n\ng\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd \u039b \u03b1 \u039b\u03bd\u03b2 .\n\n(14)\n\nIn particular, the orthonormality condition (14) assumes that the spatial angles and lengths at the point of observations are\nmeasured with the Euclidean metric \u03b4i j . Because the vector s\u03b1 is null (s\u03b1 s\u03b1 = 0) with respect to the Minkowski metric \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 , we\nconclude that the Euclidean length, |s|, of vector si is equal to 1. Indeed, one has\n\n\u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 s\u03b1 s\u03b2 = \u22121 + s2 = 0 .\n\n(15)\n\nHence, |s| = 1.\nIn the linear approximation with respect to the universal gravitational constant G, the matrix of the transformation is as follows\n[69, 70]\n\n\f39\n1\n\u039b00 = 1 \u2212 h00 (t, x) ,\n2\n\u039b0i = \u2212h0i (t, x) ,\n\u039bi0 = 0 ,\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n1\ni\n\u039b j = 1 + h00 (t, x) \u03b4i j + hTi jT (t, x) .\n2\n2\n\n(16)\n\nUsing transformation (13) we obtain relationship between the observable vector si and the coordinate direction pi\nsi = \u2212\n\n\u039bi0 \u2212 \u039bi j p j\n\n\u039b00 \u2212 \u039b0j p j\n\n.\n\n(17)\n\nIn the linear approximation this takes the form\nsi =\n\n\u0001\n1\n1 + h00 \u2212 h0 j p j pi + hTi jT p j .\n2\n\n(18)\n\nRemembering that vector |s| = 1, we find the Euclidean norm of the vector pi from the relationship\n1\n|p| = 1 \u2212 h00 + h0 j p j \u2212 hTi jT pi p j ,\n2\n\n(19)\n\n1\nsi = mi + Pi j mq hTjqT (t, x) ,\n2\n\n(20)\n\nwhich brings equation (18) to the form\n\nwhere Pi j = \u03b4 i j \u2212 ki k j is the operator of projection onto the plane being orthogonal to ki , and the Euclidean unit vector mi =\npi /|p|.\nLet us now denote by \u03b1 i the dimensionless vector describing the total angle of deflection of the light ray measured at the point\nof observation, and calculated with respect to vector ki given at past null infinity. It is defined according to [74]\n\n\u03b1 i (\u03c4 , \u03be) = ki k * \u039e\u0307(\u03c4 , \u03be) \u2212 \u039e\u0307i (\u03c4 , \u03be) ,\n\n(21)\n\n\u03b1 i (\u03c4 , \u03be) = \u2212 Pij \u039e\u0307 j (\u03c4 , \u03be) .\n\n(22)\n\nor\n\nAs a consequence of definitions (12) and (22), we conclude that\nmi = \u2212ki + \u03b1 i (\u03c4 , \u03be) .\n\n(23)\n\nAccounting for expressions (20), (23), and (34) we obtain the observed direction to the source of light\nsi (\u03c4 , \u03be) = K i + \u03b1 i (\u03c4 , \u03be) + \u03b2 i (\u03c4 , \u03be) + \u03b3 i (\u03c4 , \u03be) ,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere the unit vector K i is given by equation (30), relativistic correction \u03b2 i is defined by equation (35), and the perturbation\n1\n\u03b3 i (\u03c4 , \u03be) = \u2212 Pi j kq hTjqT (t, x)\n2\n\n(25)\n\ndescribes a deformation of the local coordinates of observer with respect to the global ADM-harmonic frame caused by the\ntransverse-traceless part of the gravitational field of the isolated system at the point of observation.\nLet two sources of light (quasars, stars, etc.) be observed along the directions s1 and s2 corresponding to two different light\nrays passing near the isolated gravitating system at the minimal distances corresponding to the (vector) impact parameters, \u03be1\nand \u03be2 . The angle \u03a8 between them, measured in the local inertial frame is\ncos \u03a8 = s1 * s2 ,\n\n(26)\n\nwhere the dot between the two vectors denotes the usual Euclidean scalar product. It is worth emphasizing that the observed\ndirection si to each source of light includes relativistic deflection of the light ray in the form of three perturbations. Two of them,\n\u03b1 i and \u03b3 i , depend only on the quantities taken at the point of observation, but \u03b2 i , according to equation (35), is also sensitive to\n\n\f40\nthe strength of the gravitational field taken at the point of emission of light. This remark reveals that according to relation (24)\na single gravitational wave signal may cause different angular displacements and/or time delays for different sources of light\nlocated at different distances from the source of gravitational waves even if the directions to the light sources are the same.\nWithout going into further details of the observational procedure we give an explicit expression for the total angle of the light\ndeflection \u03b1 i . We have\n\n\u03b1 i (\u03c4 , \u03be) = \u03b1 i (\u03c4 , \u03be) + \u03b1 i (\u03c4 , \u03be) + \u03b1 i (\u03c4 , \u03be) ,\n(G)\n\n(M)\n\n(S)\n\n(27)\n\nwhere\n\u0001\n\u03b1 i (\u03c4 , \u03be) = \u2212Pi j \u2202\u02c6\u03c4 \u03c6 j + w j ,\n(G)\n\n\u03b1 i (\u03c4 , \u03be) = \u2212\n\n(M)\n\n2M \u03be i\nr y\n\u221e\n\n(28)\n(29)\n\np\n\nl\n\n(\u22121)l+p\u2212q\nCl (l \u2212 p, p \u2212 q, q)H(2 \u2212 q) \u00d7\nl!\nl=2 p=0 q=0\n\uf8f9[\u22121]\n\uf8ee\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n(p\u2212q)\nI\n(t\n\u2212\nr)\np\u2212q\np\u2212q\nA\n\uf8fb\n1\u2212\n1\u2212\nk<a1 ...a p \u2202\u02c6a p+1 ...al > \u2202\u02c6\u03c4q \uf8f0 l\nl\nl\u22121\nr\n\u22122\u2202\u02c6i \u2211\n\n\u2211\u2211\n\n\u221e l\u22121\n\n(\u22121)l+p\nCl\u22122 (l \u2212 p \u2212 1, p \u2212 1) \u00d7\nl!\nl=2 p=0\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n(p)\nI jAl\u22121 (t \u2212 r)\n\uf8fb,\nk<a1 ...a p\u22121 \u2202\u02c6a p ...al\u22121 > \uf8f0\nr\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b5 jba Sb\nSb \u03be i\n\u03b1 i (\u03c4 , \u03be) = \u22122k j \u03b5 jba \u2202\u02c6a\n+ 2Pi j \u2202\u02c6a\n(S)\nyr\nr\n\u22124Pi j \u2211\n\n\u2211\n\n(30)\n\n\u221e l\u22121 p\n\n(\u22121)l+p\u2212ql\nCl\u22121 (l \u2212 p \u2212 1, p \u2212 q, q)H(2 \u2212 q) \u00d7\nl=2 p=0 q=0 (l + 1)!\n\uf8f9[\u22121]\n\uf8ee\n(p\u2212q)\n\u0013\n\u0012\nj\u03b5\nS\n(t\n\u2212\nr)\nk\njba\np\u2212q\nbA\nl\u22121\n\uf8fb\nk<a1 ...a p \u2202\u02c6a p+1 ...al\u22121 > \u2202\u02c6\u03c4q \uf8f0\n1\u2212\nl\u22121\nr\n+4\u2202\u02c6ia \u2211\n\n\u2211\u2211\n\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u221e l\u22121 (\u22121)l+p l\n\u22124 \u2202\u02c6a \u2212 ka \u2202\u02c6t \u2217 \u2211 \u2211\nCl\u22122 (l \u2212 p \u2212 2, p) \u00d7\nl=2 p=0 (l + 1)!\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n(p)\nSbAl\u22121 (t \u2212 r)\n\u03b5\njba\n\uf8fb\nk<a1 ...a p \u2202\u02c6a p+1 ...al\u22121 > \uf8f0Pi j\nr\n\u221e l\u22121\n\n(\u22121)l+p l\nCl\u22121 (l \u2212 p \u2212 1, p)\u00d7\nl=2 p=0 (l + 1)!\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n(p+1)\nPiq k j \u03b5 jbal\u22121 SqbAl\u22122 (t \u2212 r)\n\uf8fb.\nk<a1 ...a p \u2202\u02c6a p+1 ...al\u22121 > \uf8f0\nr\n\u22124 \u2211\n\n\u2211\n\nThese expressions do not contain any explicit integration along the light ray trajectory because all explicit integrals are either\neliminated after taking partial derivatives with respect to the upper limit of the integrals or they are vanish because the numerical\ncoefficient in front of them become nil.\nC. Gravitational shift of frequency\n\nExact calculation of the gravitational shift of frequency of electromagnetic wave travelling from the point of emission to observer plays a crucial role for the adequate interpretation of spectral astronomical investigations of high resolution including the\n\n\f41\nastronomical measurements of radial velocities of stars [131], anisotropy of cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR),\nand others. In the last decade the technique for measuring the radial velocity of stars had reached an unprecedented precision of\n1 m/sec [132, 133]. At this level the post-Newtonian effects in the orbital motion of spectroscopic binary stars can be measured\n[134, 135]. Gravitational shift of frequency of light affect the apparent brightness of the observed sources according to equation (125). Therefore, it can be important in highly accurate photometric measurements of faint radio sources with large radio\ntelescope like SKA [136]\nLet a source of light move with respect to the ADM-harmonic coordinate frame (t, xi ) with velocity V0 = \u1e8b0 (t0 ) and emit\ncontinuous electromagnetic radiation at frequency \u03bd0 = 1/(\u03b4 T0 ), where t0 and T0 are the coordinate and proper time of the\nsource of light, respectively. We denote by \u03bd = 1/(\u03b4 T ) the observed frequency of the electromagnetic radiation measured at\nthe point of observation by an observer moving with velocity V = \u1e8b(t) with respect to the ADM-harmonic coordinate frame.\nIn the geometric optics approximation we can consider the increments of the proper time, \u03b4 T0 and \u03b4 T , as infinitesimally small\nwhich allows us to operate with them as with differentials [69, 70]. Time delay equation (1) can be considered as an implicit\nfunction of the emission time t0 = t0 (t) having the time of observation t as its argument. Because the coordinate and proper\ntime at the points of emission of light and its observation are connected through the metric tensor we conclude that the observed\ngravitational shift of frequency 1 + z = \u03bd /\u03bd0 can be defined through the consecutive differentiation of the proper time of the\nsource of light, T0 , with respect to the proper time of the observer, T , [69, 70]\n1+z =\n\ndT0 dt0 dt\ndT0\n=\n.\ndT\ndt0 dt dT\n\n(31)\n\nSynge calls relation (31) the Doppler effect in terms of frequency [137, p. 122]. It is fully consistent with the definition of the\nDoppler shift in terms of energy [137, p. 231] when one compares the energy of photon at the points of emission and observation\nof light. The Doppler shift in terms of energy is given by\n1+z =\n\n\u03bd\nl\u03b1 u\u03b1\n,\n=\n\u03bd0 l0\u03b1 u\u03b10\n\n(32)\n\nwhere u\u03b10 , u\u03b1 and l0\u03b1 , l\u03b1 are 4-velocities of the source of light and observer and 4-momenta of photon at the points of emission\nand observation respectively. It is quite easy to see that both mentioned formulations of the Doppler shift effect are equivalent.\nIndeed, taking into account that u\u03b1 = dx\u03b1 /dT and l\u03b1 = \u2202 \u03c6 /\u2202 x\u03b1 , where \u03c6 is the phase of the electromagnetic wave (eikonal),\nwe obtain l\u03b1 u\u03b1 = d \u03c6 /dT , and l0\u03b1 u\u03b10 = d \u03c60 /dT0 respectively. Thus, equation (32) yields\n1+z =\n\nd \u03c6 dT0\n.\nd \u03c60 dT\n\n(33)\n\nThe phase of electromagnetic wave remains constant along the light ray trajectory. For this reason, d \u03c6 /d \u03c60 = 1 and, hence,\nequation (33) is reduced to equation (31) as expected on the ground of physical intuition. Detailed comparison of the two\ndefinitions of the Doppler shift and the proof of their identity in general theory of relativity is thoroughly discussed in [54, 138].\nWe emphasize that in equation (31) the time derivative\nh\ni1/2\ndT0\n= 1 \u2212 V02 \u2212 (1 + V02 )h00 (t0 , x0 ) \u2212 2V0i h0i (t0 , x0 ) \u2212 V0iV0j hTi jT (t0 , x0 )\n,\n(34)\ndt0\n\nis taken at the time t0 at the point of emission of light x0 along the world line of the emitter of light while the time derivative\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\u22121/2\ndt\n,\n(35)\n= 1 \u2212 V 2 \u2212 (1 + V 2 )h00 (t, x) \u2212 2V i h0i (t, x) \u2212 V iV j hTi jT (t, x)\ndT\nis calculated at the time of observation t at the position of observer x along the world line of the observer.\nThe time derivative dt0 /dt is taken along the light-ray trajectory and calculated from the time delay equation (1) where we\nhave to take into account that function \u2206(\u03c4 , \u03c40 ) depends on times t0 and t indirectly through the retarded times s0 = t0 \u2212 r0 and\ns = t \u2212 r that are arguments of the multipole moments of the isolated system and wherein r0 \u2261 |x0 | = |x(t0 )|, r = |x| = |x(t)| are\nfunctions of time t0 and t respectively. Function \u2206(\u03c4 , \u03c40 ) also depends on the time of the closest approach of light ray, t \u2217 , through\nvariables \u03c4 = t \u2212 t \u2217 , \u03c40 = t0 \u2212 t \u2217 , and on the unit vector k. Both t \u2217 and k should be considered as parameters depending on t0 and\nt because of the relative motion of the observer with respect to the source of light which causes variation in the relative position\nof the source of light and observer and, consequently, to the corresponding change in the parameters characterizing trajectory of\nthe light ray, that is in t \u2217 and k. Therefore, the function \u2206(\u03c4 , \u03c40 ) must be viewed as parametrically-dependent on four variables\n\u2206 = \u2206(s, s0 ,t \u2217 , k). Accounting for these remarks the derivative along the light ray reads as follows\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u2202s \u2202\n\u2202 s0 \u2202\n\u2202 t\u2217 \u2202\n\u2202 ki \u2202\n\u2206(s, s0 ,t \u2217 , k)\n+\n1+K*V \u2212\n+\n+\ndt0\n\u2202t \u2202s\n\u2202 t \u2202 s0\n\u2202 t \u2202 t\u2217\n\u2202 t \u2202 ki\n=\n\u001a\n\u001b\n,\n(36)\ndt\n\u2202s \u2202\n\u2202 s0 \u2202\n\u2202 t\u2217 \u2202\n\u2202 ki \u2202\n\u2217\n1 + K * V0 +\n\u2206(s, s0 ,t , k)\n+\n+\n+\n\u2202 t0 \u2202 s \u2202 t0 \u2202 s0 \u2202 t0 \u2202 t \u2217 \u2202 t0 \u2202 ki\n\n\f42\nwhere the unit vector K is defined in (30) and where we explicitly show the dependence of function \u2206(\u03c4 , \u03c40 ) on all parameters\nwhich implicitly depend on time.\nThe time derivative of vector k is calculated using the approximation k = \u2212K and formula (30) where the coordinates of the\nsource of light, x0 (t0 ), and of the observer, x(t), are considered as functions of time. These derivatives are\n\n\u2202 ki (k \u00d7 (V \u00d7 k))i\n=\n,\n\u2202t\nR\n\n(k \u00d7 (V0 \u00d7 k))i\n\u2202 ki\n=\u2212\n,\n\u2202 t0\nR\n\n(37)\n\nwhere R = |x \u2212 x0| is the coordinate distance between the observer and the source of light.\nTime derivatives of the retarded times s and s0 with respect to t and t0 are calculated from their definitions, s = t \u2212 r and\ns0 = t0 \u2212 r0 , where we have to take into account that the spatial position of the point of observation is connected to the point\nof emission of light by the unperturbed trajectory of light, x = x0 + k (t \u2212 t0 ). More explicitly, we use for the calculations the\nfollowing relations\ns = t \u2212 |x0 (t0 ) + k (t \u2212 t0 )| ,\ns0 = t0 \u2212 |x0(t0 )| ,\n\n(38)\n(39)\n\nwhere the unit vector k = k(t,t0 ) must be also considered as a function of two arguments t, t0 with its derivatives given by\nequation (37). It is instructive to notice that relation (38) combines two characteristics of the null cone \u2013 the first one is related\nto the propagation of gravitational field from the isolated system to an observer, and the second one is related to the propagation\nof light from the source of light to the same observer. Equation (39) describes a null cone characteristic corresponding to the\npropagation of gravitational field from the isolated system to the point of emission of light. Calculation of the infinitesimal\nvariations of equations (38), (39) immediately gives a set of partial derivatives\n\n\u2202s\n= 1 \u2212 k * N \u2212 (k \u00d7 V ) * (k \u00d7 N ) ,\n\u2202t\n\n(40)\n\n\u2202s\n= (1 \u2212 k * V0)(k * N ) ,\n\u2202 t0\n\n(41)\n\n\u2202 s0\n= 1 \u2212 V0 * N0 ,\n\u2202 t0\n\n(42)\n\n\u2202 s0\n= 0,\n\u2202t\n\n(43)\n\nwhere N i = xi /r and N0i = xi0 /r0 are the unit vectors directed from the isolated system to the observer and to the source of light\nrespectively..\nTime derivatives of the parameter t \u2217 = t0 \u2212 k * x0(t0 ), where again k = k(t,t0 ), read\nV0 * \u03be\n\u2202 t\u2217\n= 1 \u2212 k * V0 +\n,\n\u2202 t0\nR\n\nV *\u03be\n\u2202 t\u2217\n=\u2212\n.\n\u2202t\nR\n\n(44)\n\nTerms of the order |\u03be|/R in both formulas are produced by the time derivatives of vector k.\nIn what follows we shall restrict ourselves with a static case of an observer and a source of light, that is we shall assume\nvelocities V = V0 = 0.

In opposite case, the right side of equations (50) and (51) would contain also time derivatives\nfrom the mass and the angular momentum. Partial derivative from function \u03c8 (y0 ,t \u2217 ) is obtained from equations (48)\u2013(51) after\nreplacements y \u2192 y0 , t \u2192 t0 , and r \u2192 r0 . Equations (49)\u2013(51) do not contain explicit integrals along the light ray trajectory\nbecause all of the explicit integrals vanish after taking the partial derivatives in these equations.\nFrequency shift, z, is given by equation (31). In case when both observer and source of light are at rest with respect to\nthe ADM-harmonic reference frame, the frequency (energy) of a photon propagating through the gravitational potential of the\nisolated astronomical system changes in accordance with\ns\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03bd\n1 \u2212 h00(t0 , x0 )\n\u2202 \u03c8 (y,t \u2217 ) \u2202 \u03c8 (y0 ,t \u2217 )\n=\n1\u2212\n,\n(52)\n+\n\u03bd0\n1 \u2212 h00(t, x)\n\u2202 t\u2217\n\u2202 t\u2217\nIn the linear with respect to G approximation, equation (52) is simplified\n\n\u03b4\u03bd\n\u2202 \u03c8 (y,t \u2217 ) \u2202 \u03c8 (y0 ,t \u2217 )\n1\n1\n= h00 (t, x) \u2212 h00 (t0 , x0 ) \u2212\n+\n,\n\u03bd0\n2\n2\n\u2202 t\u2217\n\u2202 t\u2217\n\n(53)\n\nwhere \u03b4 \u03bd \u2261 \u03bd \u2212 \u03bd0 . The time of the closest approach t \u2217 enters equation (53) explicitly. At the first glance, the reader may think\nthat it must be known in order to calculate the gravitational shift of frequency. However, the partial derivative with respect to t \u2217\nhave to be understood in the sense of equation (30) which makes it evident that the time derivative with respect to t \u2217 taken on the\nlight-ray path is, in fact, the time derivative with respect to time t taken before the using of the light-ray trajectory substitution.\nThus, the gravitational shift of frequency is actually not sensitive to the time of the closest approach t \u2217 , and can be recast to the\nform which is more suitable for practical applications,\n\n\u03b4\u03bd\n\u2202 \u03c8 (t, x) \u2202 \u03c8 (t0 , x0 )\n1\n1\n= h00 (t, x) \u2212 h00 (t0 , x0 ) \u2212\n+\n,\n\u03bd0\n2\n2\n\u2202t\n\u2202 t0\n\n(54)\n\nwhere \u03c8 (t, x) and \u03c8 (t0 , x0 ) are relativistic perturbations of the electromagnetic eikonal taken at the points of observation and\nemission of light respectively. These time derivatives are given by the same equations (48)\u2013(51) after making use of (30).\nEquation (54) has been derived by making use of the definition (31). It is straightforward to prove that the definition (32) brings\nabout the same result. Indeed, in the case of the static observer and the source of light their 4-velocities are, u\u03b1 = (dt/dT, 0, 0, 0)\n\n\f44\nand u\u03b10 = (dt0 /dT0 , 0, 0, 0), and the wave vector l\u03b1 = \u03c9 (k\u03b1 + \u2202\u03b1 \u03c8 ) (see equation (36)) where \u03c9 is a constant frequency of light\nwave which is conserved along the light ray because of the equation of the parallel transport (14). Substituting these relations to\n(32) leads immediately to equation (54) as expected.\nPhysical interpretation of the relativistic frequency shift given by equation (54) is straightforward although the calculation of\ndifferent components of the time derivatives from the eikonal are tedious. The first two terms in the left side of (54) reads\n1\nGM GM\n1\nh00 (t, x) \u2212 h00 (t0 , x0 ) =\n\u2212\n,\n2\n2\nr\nr0\n\n(55)\n\nand represents the difference between the values of the spherically-symmetric part of the Newtonian gravitational potential of\nthe isolated system taken at the point of observation and emission of light. The time derivatives of the eikonal depending on the\nmass and spin multipole moments of the isolated system are given in (50), (51). Scrutiny examination of these equations reveal\nthat these components of the frequency shift depend on the first and higher order time derivatives of the multipole moments\nwhich vanish in the stationary case. The gravitational frequency shift contains the gauge-dependent contribution as well. This\ncontribution is given by equation (49) and can be calculated by making use of equations (66)\u2013(69).

Gravity-induced rotation of the plane of polarization of light\n\nAny kind of axisymmetric gravitational field induces a relativistic effect of the rotation of the polarization plane of an electromagnetic wave propagating through this field. To some extent this effect is similar to Faraday's effect in electrodynamics [108].\nThe Faraday effect is caused by the presence of magnetic field along the trajectory of propagation of electromagnetic wave while\nthe gravity-induced rotation of the plane of polarization of light is caused by the presence of the, so-called, gravitomagnetic field\nassociated with the angular momentum and spin-type multipoles of the isolated system [139, 140]. This gravitomagnetic effect\nwas first discussed by Skrotskii ([119, 120] and a number of other researches [121, 122, 141\u2013145]. Recently, we have studied\nthe Skrotskii effect caused by a spinning body moving arbitrarily fast and derived the Lorentz-invariant expression for this effect\n[146]. In the present chapter we further generalize the Skrotskii effect to the case of an isolated system emitting gravitational\nwaves of arbitrary multipolarity.\n\n\f45\nWe consider the parallel transport of the reference polarization tetrad e\u03b1(\u03b2 ) defined by equations (84) along the light ray. We\nassume for simplicity that at the past null infinity the spatial vectors of the tetrad, e0(i) , coincide with the spatial unit vectors of\nthe coordinate tetrad defined by equation (80). The parallel transport of the tetrad along the light ray is defined by equation (96).\nWe are interested only in solving equation (96) for vectors e\u03b1(n) (n = 1, 2) that are used in description of polarization of light.\nThe propagation equation for the spatial components ei(n) can be written in the following form\n\u0015\n\u0014\nd\n1\nei(n) + hi j e p(n) + \u03b5i j p e j(n) \u03a9 p = 0 ,\nd\u03c4\n2\n\n(n = 1, 2.)\n\n(59)\n\nwhere the angular velocity vector\n1\n\u03a9i = \u2212 \u03b5i j p \u2202 j (h p\u03b1 k\u03b1 ) ,\n2\n\n(60)\n\ndescribes the rate of the rotation of the plane of polarization of electromagnetic wave caused by the presence of the gravitomagnetic field. As soon as equation (59) is solved, the time component e0(n) of the tetrad is obtained from the orthogonality\ncondition, l\u03b1 e\u03b1(n) = 0, which implies that\ne0(n) = ki ei(n) + h0iei(n) + hi j ki e j(n) + \u03b4i j \u039e\u0307i e j(n) ,\n\n(61)\n\nwhere the relativistic perturbation \u039e\u0307i of the light-ray trajectory is given in equation (15).\nLet us decompose vector \u03a9i into three components that are parallel and perpendicular to the unit vector ki . We can use in the\nfirst approximation the well-known decomposition of the Kroneker symbol in the orthonormal basis\n\n\u03b4 i j = ai a j + bi b j + k i k j ,\n\n(62)\n\nwhere (a, b, k) are three orthogonal unit vectors of the reference tetrad at infinity. Decomposition of \u03a9i is, then, given by\n\u03a9i = (a * \u03a9)ai + (b * \u03a9)bi + (k * \u03a9)ki .\n\n(63)\n\nTaking into account that at any point on the light-ray trajectory, vectors ei(1) = ai + O(h\u03b1\u03b2 ), ei(2) = bi + O(h\u03b1\u03b2 ), one obtains\nequations of the parallel transport of these vectors (59) in the following form\n\u0015\n\u0014\nd\n1\n(64)\nei(1) + hi j e j(1) \u2212 (k * \u03a9)ei(2) = 0 ,\nd\u03c4\n2\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\nd\nei(2) + hi j e j(2) + (k * \u03a9)ei(1) = 0 ,\n(65)\nd\u03c4\n2\nwhere equalities \u03b5i jl ei(1) kl = \u2212ei(2) + O(h\u03b1\u03b2 ), and \u03b5i jl ei(2) kl = ei(1) + O(h\u03b1\u03b2 ) have been used.\nSolutions of equations (64), (65) in the linear approximation with respect to the (post-Newtonian) angular velocity \u03a9i read\n\u0012Z \u03c4\n\u0013\n1\nj\ni\ni\nk * \u03a9(\u03c3 ) d \u03c3 bi ,\n(66)\ne (1) = a \u2212 hi j a +\n2\n\u2212\u221e\n\u0012Z \u03c4\n\u0013\n1\nk * \u03a9(\u03c3 ) d \u03c3 ai ,\n(67)\nei(2) = bi \u2212 hi j b j \u2212\n2\n\u2212\u221e\nwhere the second term in the right side of (66), (67) preserve orthogonality of vectors ei(1) and ei(2) in the presence of gravitational\nfield while the last term describes the Skrotskii effect which is a small rotation of each of the vectors at the angle\n\u03a6(\u03c4 ) =\n\nZ \u03c4\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nk * \u03a9 d\u03c3\n\n(68)\n\nabout the direction of light propagation, k, in the local plane of vectors e(1) and e(2) . It is worth noting that the Euclidean dot\nproduct k * \u03a9 can be expressed in terms of partial differentiation with respect to the vector \u03be i of the impact parameter. This can\nbe done by making use of equation (31) and noting that \u03b5i j p k j k p \u2261 0, so that\n1\nk * \u03a9 = k\u03b1 k j \u03b5 j pq \u2202\u02c6q h\u03b1 p .\n2\n\n(69)\n\n\f46\nHence, the transport equation for the angle \u03a6 assumes the following form\nd\u03a6 1 \u03b1 j\n= k k \u03b5 j pq \u2202\u02c6q h\u03b1 p .\nd\u03c4\n2\n\n(70)\n\nThis equation can be split in three, linearly-independent parts corresponding to the contributions of the gauge, \u03a6(G) , the mass,\n\u03a6(M) , and the spin, \u03a6(S) , multipoles of the gravitational field to the Skrotskii effect.

Static part\nof gravitational field of the localized system and gravitational waves deflect light rays which are emitted at the moment t0 at the point S and\nreceived at the moment t at the point O. The point E on the line OS corresponds to the moment t \u2217 of the closest approach of a light ray to the\ndeflector D. We denoted the distances as follows: OS = R, DO = r, DS = r0 , the impact parameter DE = d, OE = \u03c4 > 0, ES = \u03c40 = \u03c4 \u2212 R < 0.\nThe impact parameter d is much smaller as compared with all other distances.\n\nA.\n\nSmall parameters and asymptotic expansions\n\nIn the case of a small impact parameter of the light ray with respect to the isolated system the near-zone gravitational field of\nthe system strongly affects propagation of the light ray only when the light particle (photon) moves in the close proximity to the\nsystem where the effects on the light ray propagation caused by gravitational waves are suppressed [99, 100]. In what follows,\nwe assume that the impact parameter d of the light ray is small as compared with both distances r and r0 , that is, d \u226a min[r, r0 ]\n(see Fig. 3). This assumption allows us to introduce two small parameters: \u03b5 \u2261 d/r and \u03b50 \u2261 d/r0 . If the light ray is propagated\nthrough the near-zone of the isolated system one more small parameter can be introduced, \u03b5\u03bb \u2261 d/\u03bb , where \u03bb is the characteristic\nwavelength of the gravitational radiation emitted by the system proportional to the product of the speed of gravity (= c in general\nrelativity) and the characteristic period of matter oscillations in the isolated system. Parameters \u03b5 , \u03b50 and \u03b5\u03bb are not physically\ncorrelated. Parameter \u03b5\u03bb is used for the post-Newtonian expansion of the equations describing the observed effects \u2013 deflection\nof light, time delay, etc. This expansion can be also viewed as a Taylor expansion with respect to the parameter v/c, where v is\nthe characteristic speed of motion of matter composing the isolated system and c is the speed of propagation of gravity. If the\nlight ray does not enter the near zone of the system the parameter \u03b5\u03bb is not small and the post-Newtonian expansion can not be\nperformed.\nThe small-impact-parameter expansions for the retarded time variables y and y0 yield:\n!\n\u221e\np\n\u03b5\ny =\n\u2212 \u2211 Ck \u03b5 2k\u22121 ,\nr2 \u2212 d 2 \u2212 r = \u2212d\n(1)\n2 k=2\n!\nq\n\u221e\n\u03b50\n2k\u22121\n2\n2\n,\n(2)\n\u2212 \u2211 Ck \u03b50\ny0 = \u2212 r0 \u2212 d \u2212 r0 = \u22122r0 + d\n2 k=2\nand\n1\n1\n= \u2212 2\nyr\nd\n\n\u221e\n\n2 + \u2211 Ck \u03b5\nk=1\n\n2k\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\n1\n1 \u221e\n= 2 \u2211 Ck \u03b502k ,\ny0 r0\nd k=1\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the numerical coefficients entering the expansions are\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(\u22121)k 1 1\n(2k \u2212 1)!\n1\nCk =\n\u2212 1 * ... *\n\u2212k+1 =\n.\nk! 2 2\n2\n(2k)!!\nRetarded time variables, s = t \u2212 r and s0 = t0 \u2212 r0 , are expanded as follows\n!\n\u221e\n\u03b5\n2k\u22121\n\u2217\n,\ns = t \u2212d\n\u2212 \u2211 Ck \u03b5\n2 k=2\n\u2217\n\ns0 = t \u2212 2r0 + d\n\n\u221e\n\u03b50\n\u2212 \u2211 Ck \u03b502k\u22121\n2 k=2\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n!\n\n,\n\n(7)\n\n\f49\nwhere Ck is given by equation (5) and t \u2217 is the time of the closest approach of the light ray to the barycenter of the isolated\nsystem.\nUsing (6) and (7) we can write down the post-Newtonian expansions for functions of the retarded time t \u2212 r as follows\n!k\n\u221e\n\u03b5\n2k\u22121\n\u2212 \u2211 Ck \u03b5\nF (k) (t \u2217 )\n2 k=2\n\u0001\nd\n= F(t \u2217 ) \u2212 \u03b5 \u1e1e(t \u2217 ) + O \u03b5 2 \u03b5\u03bb2 ,\n2\n!k\n\u221e\n\u221e\nk\nd\n\u03b50\n2k\u22121\nF(t0 \u2212 r0 ) = \u2211\nF (k) (t \u2217 \u2212 2r0)\n\u2212 \u2211 Ck \u03b50\nk!\n2\nk=0\nk=2\n\u0001\nd\n= F(t \u2217 \u2212 2r0 ) + \u03b50 \u1e1e(t \u2217 \u2212 2r0 ) + O \u03b502 \u03b5\u03bb2 ,\n2\n\u221e\n\n(\u22121)k d k\nF(t \u2212 r) = \u2211\nk!\nk=0\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the dot above functions denote the total time derivative. We notice that convergence of the post-Newtonian time series\nfor light propagation depends, in fact, not just on a single parameter, \u03b5\u03bb \u223c v/c, that is typical in the post-Newtonian celestial\nmechanics of extended bodies [54, 69, 70], but on the product of two parameters. Therefore, the convergence requires satisfaction\nof two conditions\n\n\u03b5\u03b5\u03bb \u226a 1 ,\n\u03b50 \u03b5\u03bb \u226a 1 ,\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\nwhere the numerical value of the parameter \u03b5\u03bb must be taken for the smallest wavelength, \u03bbmin , in the spectrum of the gravitational radiation emitted by the isolated system. Conditions (10), (11) ensure convergence of the post-Newtonian series in (8)\nand (9) respectively. If the source of light rays and observer are at infinite distances from the isolated system then \u03b5 \u2243 0 and\n\u03b50 \u2243 0, and the requirements (10), (11) are satisfied automatically, irrespective of the structure of the Fourier spectrum (5) of\nthe gravitational radiation emitted by the isolated system. In a real astronomical practice such an assumption may not be always\nsatisfied. In such cases it is more natural to avoid the post-Newtonian expansions of the metric tensor and/or observable effects\nand operate with the functions of the retarded time. It is important to notice that the retarded time s = t \u2212 r which enters the result\nof the calculation of the is a characteristic of the Einstein equations of gravitational field, not the Maxwell equations. Therefore,\nmeasuring the effect of the gravitational deflection of light caused by time-dependent gravitational field allows us to measure\nthe speed of gravity with respect to the speed of light. This type of experiments have been proposed in our paper [126] and\nsuccessfully performed in 2003 [127]. There were several publications (see review [147]) arguing that the speed of gravity is\nirrelevant in the light-ray deflection experiments by moving bodies. Unfortunately, all the authors of those publications operated\nwith the post-Newtonian expansion of the gravitational field which replaces the retarded time s = t \u2212 r of the gravitational field\nwith the time t \u2217 of the closest approach of light to the light-ray deflecting body like in equation (6). This explains why the effect\nof the retardation of gravity was confused with the retardation of light in [147].\nIf we assume that the mass and angular momentum of the isolated system are conserved the asymptotic expansions of integrals\n(1), (2) of the stationary part of the metric tensor have the following form\n\u0014 \u0015[\u22121]\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221e\n1\n(2k \u2212 1)! 2k\nr\n\u03b5\n= \u2212 ln\n\u2212 2 ln \u03b5 \u2212 \u2211 2k\n2\nr\n2rE\nk=1 2 (k!)\n\u0015\n1 [\u22121]\nr0\n\u0014 \u0015[\u22122]\n1\nr\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0014\n\n1\nr0\n\n\u0015[\u22122]\n\n= \u22122 ln d + lnr + ln(2rE ) + O(\u03b5 2 ),\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u221e\n\u0013\n\u0012\n(2k \u2212 1)! 2k\n2r0\n2r0\n\u03b5\n=\n\u2212\nln\n\u2212 \u2211 2k\n+ O(\u03b502 ),\n= \u2212 ln\n2 0\nrE\n2\n(k!)\nr\nE\nk=1\n!\" \u0012\n#)\n(\n\u0013 \u221e\n\u221e\n(2k \u2212 1)! 2k\n\u03b5 2r\n2k\nln\n\u03b5\n= \u2212r 1 + 1 + \u2211 Ck \u03b5\n+ \u2211 2k\n2\n2rE\nk=1\nk=1 2 (k!)\n\u0012 2 \u0013\u0015\n\u0014\nd\nd 1\n= \u2212r \u2212 2r ln d + r ln (2rrE ) \u2212 \u03b5\n\u2212 ln\n+ O(\u03b5 2 ),\n2 2\n2rrE\n!\" \u0012\n#)\n(\n\u0013 \u221e\n\u221e\n(2k \u2212 1)! 2k\n2r0\n2k\nln\n\u03b5\n+ \u2211 2k\n= \u2212r0 1 \u2212 1 + \u2211 Ck \u03b50\n2 0\nrE\nk=1\nk=1 2 (k!)\n\u0014\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0012\nd 1\n2r0\n2r0\n\u2212 \u03b50\n+ O(\u03b502 ).\n+ ln\n= \u2212r0 + r0 ln\nrE\n2 2\nrE\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\n\f50\nNext several equations yield the estimates for the partial derivatives with respect to the parameters \u03be i and \u03c4 from functions of\nthe retarded time (of gravity).

The distance between the source of light and observer is R = |r \u2212 r0 |. In the plane\ngravitational-wave approximation we assume that\n(a) the characteristic wavelength of gravitational waves, \u03bb \u226a min[r, r0 ] ,\n(b) the distance between the source of light and observer, R \u226a min[r, r0 ] .\nCondition (a) tells us that both the source of light and observer are lying in the wave zone of the isolated system. Condition (b)\nallows us to consider the gravitational waves emitted by the isolated system as plane waves when they propagate from the source\nof light to observer. This approximation is vizualized in Fig. 4.\nWe introduce small parameters \u03b4\u03bb = max[\u03bb /r, \u03bb /r0 ], \u03b4 = R/r and \u03b40 = R/r0 The coordinate relation between r, r0 and\nR = |r \u2212 r0 | can be written as follows\nr02 = r2 \u2212 2rR cos \u03b8 + R2 = r2 (1 \u2212 2\u03b4 cos \u03b8 + \u03b4 2 ) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b8 \u2013 is the angle between the directions \"observer \u2013 the source of light\" and \"observer \u2013 the gravitating system\" (see Fig.\n4).
