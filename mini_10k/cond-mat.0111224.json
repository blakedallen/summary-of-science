Proposals\nbased on quantum optics naturally emphasize the\naspect of optimal isolation [1\u20133], while those following the solid state route exploit the variability and scalability of modern nanoscale fabrication techniques [4\u20138]. Recently, various designs\nusing superconducting structures have been successfully tested for quantum coherent operation\n[9\u201311], however, the ultimate goal of reaching coherent evolution over thousands of elementary\noperations remains a formidable task. Protecting qubits from decoherence by exploiting topological stability, a qualitatively new proposal due\nto Kitaev [12], holds the promise for long decoherence times, but its practical physical implementation has remained unclear so far. Here, we\nshow how strongly correlated systems developing\nan isolated two-fold degenerate quantum dimer\nliquid groundstate can be used in the construction\nof topologically stable qubits and discuss their implementation using Josephson junction arrays.\nAny quantum computer has to incorporate some fault\ntolerance as we cannot hope to eliminate all the various\nsources of decoherence. Amazing progress has been made\nin the development of quantum error correction schemes\n[13] which are based on redundant multi-qubit encoding\nof the quantum data combined with error detection- and\nrecovery steps through appropriate manipulation of the\ndata. Error correction schemes are generic (and hence are\napplicable to any hardware implementation), but require\nrepeated active interference with the computer during\nrun-time; the delocalization of the data, often in a hierarchical structure, boosts the system size by a factor\n102 to 103 . Delocalization of the quantum information\nis also at the heart of topological quantum computing\n[12], however, the stabilization against decoherence is entirely deferred to the hardware level (hence it is tied to\nthe specific implementation) and is achieved passively.\nIn searching for a physical implementation of topological\nqubits one strives for an extended (many body) quantum system where the Hilbert space of quantum states\ndecomposes into mutually orthogonal sectors, each sector remaining isolated under the action of local pertur-\n\nbations. Choosing the two qubit states from groundstates in different sectors protects these states from unwanted mixing through noise; protection from leakage\nwithin the sector has to be secured through a gapped\nexcitation spectrum. As no local operator can interfere\nwith these states, global operators must be found (and\nimplemented) allowing for the manipulation of the qubit\nstate.\nA promising candidate fulfilling the above requirements is the quantum dimer system [14\u201316]: recent quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the dimer model on a\ntriangular lattice provide evidence for a gapped liquid\ngroundstate [17] (see [18,19] for a discussion of similar exotic groundstates in spin models) and we will discuss its\ntopological robustness below. The physical implementation of such a dimer system can be realized with the help\nof quantum Josephson junction arrays. Such arrays allow\nfor a proper 'material design' as the energy scales governing the charge and phase degrees of freedom can be tuned\nthrough junctions with appropriate tunnel barriers and\ncapacitances. Shaped into the form of a ring, the Josephson junction array emulating a dimer system allows for\nthe construction of topologically protected qubits.\nThe simplest dimer model is defined on a square lattice;\nallowed configurations are coverings with dimers connecting neighboring vertices satisfying the constraint that every vertex belongs to only one dimer, see Fig. 1. Attributing equal energies to these states, the classical model is\ncharacterized by an extensive entropy. The quantum dynamics is introduced by the hopping Hamiltonian\nX\n\u0001\n(1)\n| ih | + | ih |\nHt = \u2212t\n\u2737\n\nrotating parallel dimers on appropriate plaquettes \u2737. As\na result, the degeneracy of the classical model is lifted,\nwith 'columnar' and 'staggered' (e.g., brickwall) phases\n(see Fig. 1) assuming minimal and maximal energies, respectively. In order to avoid such crystalline ordering we\nfrustrate parallel dimers with the interaction term\nX\n\u0001\n(2)\nHv = v\n| ih | + | ih | .\n\u2737\n\nAt t = v (the Rokhsar-Kivelson point) a zero energy\ndimer liquid groundstate is formed involving all allowed\nconfigurations with equal amplitudes [15]. For the square\nlattice this liquid phase is restricted to the point t = v\nand tuning v away from t the liquid loses the competition with various crystalline phases [20]. Here, we are\n1\n\n\finterested in systems developing a stable liquid\nextended parameter range. Such a stabilization\nachieved by the term\nX\u0002\n\u0001\nHd =\n\u2212t | ih | + | ih | + h.c. + \u03bc| ih\n\nover an\nmay be\n\n\u2737\n\n|\n\n\u0003\n\nx-axis, leaving the boundaries along the y-direction free\n(an additional periodic boundary condition along the ydirection defines a torus, see later). In the absence of\ndiagonal dimers (the limit \u03bc \u2192 \u221e in (3)) the sum \u03c6\ncounting directed dimers cut by the reference line \u03b3 parallel to the y-axis defines a topological order parameter (dimers pointing into opposite directions are counted\nwith opposite sign): the action of the Hamiltonian H =\nHt + Hv leaves \u03c6 invariant and the Hilbert space splits\ninto topological sectors H\u03c6 characterized by the integers\n\u03c6. Within our electrodynamic analogue\nthis topological\nR\ninvariant is given by the flux \u03c6 = dy \u03b5ex of the electric induction across \u03b3 and each sector H\u03c6 is characterized by an average polarization ex = \u03c6/\u03b5Ly producing a\ngroundstate energy E = \u03b5e2 Lx Ly /2 = \u03c62 Lx /2\u03b5Ly \u2261 E\u03c6 .\nAt finite values of the chemical potential \u03bc the Hamiltonian (3) introduces mobile defects with charge \u00b12 [21,24].\nThese charges mix states with electric flux \u03c6 \u00b1 2: creating two defects of charge \u00b12, carrying one defect around\nthe cylinder, and subsequent annihilation with its partner changes the flux \u03c6 by 2; as a result, the infinite set\nof sectors H\u03c6 collapses to the even and odd sectors He,o .\n\n(3)\n\ntransforming horizontally (| i) and vertically (| i)\nshifted dimers into diagonal ones | i at the energy cost\n2\u03bc (only one family of diagonals is chosen). Tuning the\nchemical potential \u03bc from \u221e to 0, diagonal dimer flips\nproliferate and we can study the evolution of the dimer\nmodel as we go from a square to a triangular lattice [21].\nliquid\n\ny\n\n\u03b3\n\nbrickwall\n\nstaggered\n\ncolumnar\n\ncolumnar\n\nx\n\nThe Hamiltonian projected onto the space of ground\nstates within\ntopological sectors H\u03c6 takes\n\u0001 the form\nP\nHsec = \u03c6 E\u03c6 |\u03c6ih\u03c6| + J(|\u03c6ih\u03c6 + 2| + h.c.) . For large\nvalues of the chemical potential \u03bc \u226b t the defect pairs\nare only virtual and the amplitude J mixing states with\ndifferent \u03c6 is exponentially small in the circumference Lx ,\nJ \u221d (t/\u03bc)Lx .\n\nFIG. 1. Dimers on a square lattice forming liquid (main\npanel), brickwall, and columnar configurations. Periodic\nboundary conditions are applied along the x-direction. The\nsublattice A is marked by solid bullets; dimers are attributed\na direction pointing away from bullets. The topological invariant \u03c6 counts the number of dimers crossing the reference\nline \u03b3, with dimers pointing to the right (left) counting with\npositive (negative) signs (here, \u03c6 = 1). Right: staggered and\ncolumnar configurations in the triangular lattice.\n\nAs \u03bc drops below an energy of order t, defects proliferate and undergo Bose condensation; the concomitant long range order in the condensate phase \u03c6 implies large charge fluctuations and thus the electric field\nflux across \u03b3 fluctuates strongly. In this phase the mixing between sectors is large with h\u03c62 i \u221d Ly : assuming a superfluid density \u03c1s , the hydrodynamic description of the charged superfluid [23] is given by the Euclidean action (in\nspace; \u03c1 denotes the conju\u0002\nP Fourier\ngate to \u03c6) SE = \u03c9,K \u03c9 \u03c1\u2212\u03c9,\u2212K \u03c6\u03c9,K +\u03c1s K 2 |\u03c6\u03c9,K |2 /2+\n\u0003\n|\u03c1\u03c9,K |2 /2\u03b5K 2 , from which we derive a density correlator\nh\u03c1\u03c1i = \u03c1s K 2 /(\u03c1s /\u03b5 + \u03c9 2 ). The relation \u03b5\u2207 * e = \u03c1 allows\nus to find the equal time correlator of the electric induc\u221a\ntion h\u03b5e\u03bc (R, t)\u03b5e\u03bd (R\u2032 , t)i = \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u03b4 2 (R\u2212R\u2032 ) \u03c1s \u03b5/2, result\u221a\ning in the mean electric flux h\u03c62 i = \u03c1s \u03b5Ly /2 crossing\nthe line \u03b3; the local correlations in the electric field are\na consequence of the dispersion-free plasmon spectrum.\nP\nThe new groundstates |e, oi \u221d \u03c6e,o a\u03c6e,o |\u03c6e,o i involve\ncontributions from all sectors He,o , with \u03c6e = 2k and\n\u03c6o = 2k + 1 running over even and odd integers; their\nphysical properties are conveniently characterized by the\ndistribution function P (\u03c6) = |a\u03c6 |2 \u221d exp(\u2212\u03c62 /2\u03c3), with\nthe Gaussian form appropriate for a process involving a\nsum of statistically independent elements. The width \u03c3\nis obtained through a comparison with the second mo\u221a\nment h\u03c62 i, \u03c3 = \u03c1s \u03b5Ly /2. Expectation values in even\n\nThe above type of quantum dimer models has been actively discussed in the context of short-range resonatingvalence-bond (RVB) models [22] for high temperature\nsuperconductivity [14]. In order to gain more insight\ninto its physical properties we exploit a mapping to an\n'electrodynamic' analogue [20,21,23]: We decorate the bipartite square lattice (sublattices A and B) with static\ncharges \u03c1\u2737 = \u00b11, placing all positive charges on the\nsublattice A, see Fig. 1. A dimer covering {dhi,ji } of\nbonds hi, ji of this 'ionic crystal' is mapped to a distribution of electric dipoles {\u2212phi,ji }; the electric field\ne = \u2212hphi,ji i\u03b4A resulting from averaging over small areas \u03b4A then satisfies Gauss' law \u2207e = h\u03c1i\u03b4A = 0. The\nsimplest dynamics preserving this constraint is given by\nFaradays law or, more precisely, (compact) quantum electrodynamics. Here, we are interested in the large-scale\n(global) aspects of the model and hence we will keep\nthe discussion on a phenomenological level; the physical\nproperties of the dimer liquid phase will be described in\nterms of the electric field e and the dielectric constant \u03b5.\nWhile the order characterizing the crystal phases is obvious, the topological order present in the dimer liquid\nphase is more subtle [14\u201316]: we consider a cylindrical\ngeometry with periodic boundary conditions along the\n2\n\n\fand odd sectors He,o are given by the sums over even and\nodd \u03c6 with weight P (\u03c6). As a result, differences between\nexpectation values in He,o are exponentially small in Ly ,\ne.g., the average squares of electric fluxes differ by\n(4)\n\nHence, the presence of diagonal dimers provides us with\nonly two topological sectors for a system defined on a\ncylinder (and 4 sectors on a torus). The corresponding groundstates are degenerate in the limit Lx,y \u2192 \u221e.\nFinite-size effects as well as local disorder lead to an exponentially weak energy splitting (cf. (4)). Furthermore,\nthe topological property of the system inhibits any mixing of the two groundstates. In the thermodynamic limit\nthe collapse of infinitely many to two topological sectors\ninvolves a quantum phase transition in the parameter \u03bc.\nFor \u03bc = 0 the above model corresponds to a symmetric triangular lattice (upon including the v-term) and we\nexpect favorable conditions for the construction of protected qubits.\nIndeed, this expectation is supported by results obtained from numerical studies: recent Monte Carlo simulations by Moessner and Sondhi [17] on large systems\nwith Lx,y = 36 exhibit short-range dimer-dimer correlations within a parameter region 2/3 < v/t < 1, indicative\nof a liquid state. Furthermore, the weak temperature dependence of this data within the temperature interval\n0.25t > T > 0.03t provides evidence for a gapped spectrum (increasing v beyond t, a first-order transition takes\nthe liquid into the staggered phase, while decreasing v\nbelow 2t/3 establishes some crystalline order).\nWe have numerically diagonalized the t-v dimer Hamiltonian H = Ht + Hv on a triangular lattice in order to\nestimate the gap protecting the liquid and verify the absence of low lying edge states; in addition we have investigated the robustness of the degenerate groundstates\nunder local perturbations (requiring exact diagonalization limited to smaller systems). We have chosen both\ncylindrical and toroidal geometries, with system sizes going up to Lx,y = 6; although subject to finite size effects\nwe expect that our approach describes well the liquid\nphase where the short-ranged dimer correlations (of order of one lattice constant [17]) reduce the influence of\nthe boundaries. Our exact diagonalization study confirms the presence of a gap of order \u2206 \u2248 0.1t, taking up\nlarge values on approaching the Rokhsar-Kivelson point\nt = v. Comparing the spectra for tori (no open boundaries) with those of cylinders (where the two open boundaries could accommodate edge states, would they exist)\nwe note that the gap persists, from which we infer the\nabsence of low lying edge-states in the dimer liquid (this\nshould be contrasted with the situation in the quantum\nHall system).\nIn order to test the susceptibility of the degenerate groundstates to local perturbations we assign all\n\n\u2206d /d\n\n1.5\n\n0.04\n\nd=0.01t\nd=0.02t\nd=0.04t\n\ncylinder\n6*5\n\n\u2206d /d\n\n\u221a\nh\u03c62 ie \u2212 h\u03c62 io \u223c exp(\u2212\u03c0 2 \u03c1s \u03b5Ly /4).\n\nlinks random chemical potentials \u03bcd homogeneously distributed over the interval [\u2212d/2, d/2], d < t. In finite\ncylinders and tori, particular symmetries specific to some\ngeometries Lx,y produce an exact degeneracy of eigenstates from different topological classes; for the 6\u22175 cylinder and torus used in our study the symmetry analysis\npredicts double-degeneracy. As shown in Fig. 2 the disorder induced groundstate splitting \u2206d collapses dramatically as we go from the crystal (v > t) to the liquid phase\n(v < t) and slowly recovers as v is decreased further. We\nattribute the sharp drop at v \u2248 t to the first-order solidliquid transition; the small disorder splitting at v < t\ntestifies for the efficient protection of the dimer liquid\ngroundstates from local perturbations. Decreasing v further below t we observe level crossings which we attribute\nto the appearance of intermediate crystalline phases [17]\nbefore reaching the fluctuating columnar phase at large\nnegative values of v.\n\n0.02\n\ntorus\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n\nv/t\n\n6*5\n1\n0.01\n\n0.5\n0\n0.8\n\n0\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0.9\n\n0\n\n1\n\nv/t\n\n2\n\nFIG. 2. Splitting \u2206d of the groundstate energies under the\naction of a disorder potential of strength d for a 6 \u2217 5 torus\nand a 6\u22175 cylinder (inset; periodicity is along x with Lx = 6).\nThe disorder only weakly perturbs the dimer liquid groundstates at v < t (note the expanded view near v \u223c t for the\n6 \u2217 5 torus). The crossovers between various phases become\nclearly visible in the susceptibility to a disorder potential.\n\nSummarizing, the combination of Monte Carlo simulations [17] and diagonalization indicate that on approaching the point v = t from below, the triangular\ndimer model develops an isolated degenerate dimer liquid groundstate free of edge states. Within the parameter region \u223c 0.8 < v/t < 1 we find a gap of order\n0.1t and groundstates which are robust under disorder\nto within 1% of the disorder potential; we expect a further increase of this robustness with system size, cf. (4).\nTranslating these findings to potential implementations\nof this two-state system, we find the latter to be quite\ntolerant with respect to (static) local variations in parameters appearing in the fabrication process. Regarding\ndecoherence, the amplitude mixing of the two groundstates is strongly suppressed, since it involves creation of\ntopological defects (real or virtual) violating the dimer\nconstraint. The decoherence in the relative phase of the\ntwo groundstates originates either from their adiabatic\n3\n\n\fsplitting by an external low-frequency noise, or the creation of non-topological excitations within each sector.\nThe former is suppressed for the same reason that leads\nto the robustness with respect to local disorder, while the\nlatter is inhibited by the gap \u2206, which sets the requirement T \u226a \u2206 on the operation temperature.\nIn the following we propose two types of Josephson\njunction arrays for the implementation of the above topologically protected quantum dimer liquid groundstates\nand their use for quantum computing. In the first array (JJT), the vertices of the triangular lattice are structured into six Y-shaped superconducting islands with two\nends joining into the hexagonal vertex and the third end\nlinking to the neighboring hexagon, see Fig. 3. The 5 parameters, the capacitance CY of the island to the groundplate, the capacitance Ch and Josephson current Ih of the\nhexagonal vertex junction, and the capacitance Cl and\nJosephson current Il of the link junction, are chosen to\nemulate the triangular quantum dimer model. All capacitances and currents define corresponding energies E C =\ne2 /2C and E J = \u03a60 I/2\u03c0c, where \u03a60 = hc/2e denotes the\nflux quantum (e.g., EhC = (2e)2 /2Ch , EhJ = \u03a60 Ih /2\u03c0c).\nWe first find CY , Ch , and Il defining the classical dimer\nstates: We choose a large capacitance Ch in order to\njoin the islands electrically into one hexagonal vertex. A\nsmall capacitance CY defines the large charging energy\nEhex \u2248 EYC /6 of the hexagonal vertex, the basic energy\nscale of the array. We introduce 'charge frustration' of\nthe vertices by biasing the array with a global electric\ngate such as to equalize the energies (to an accuracy better than ElJ ) of two states differing by one Cooper pair\n(this defines a 'half-filled' array); the large charging energy Ehex lifts other charge states to high energies. The\nCooper pairs lower their energy via tunneling (involving\nthe coupling Il ) through the link junction joining two vertices - the 'bonding' state of such a Cooper pair defines\nthe dimer state. With only half a Cooper-pair available\nper hexagonal vertex, each vertex is involved in the formation of one and only one of these 'valence bonds'. This\ndefines the 'classical' configurations of the dimer model;\nthe corresponding Hilbert space of dimer states is protected by the energy scale ElJ .\nThe dimer dynamics involves the vertex junction and\nproceeds via localization of one dimer to the vertex (with\nan energy cost ElJ ) and subsequent hops (of two parallel\ndimers/Cooper pairs over junctions with energy EhJ , see\nFig. 3) to the new vertex islands. The hopping amplitude\nis of order t \u223c EhJ 2 /ElJ ; explicit calculation gives the result t = (9/16)EhJ 2 /ElJ . The electrostatic interaction between dimers depends on the choice of the capacitance\nmatrix and its dependence on the dimer configuration is\nnon-trivial. First, we compare the energies of the staggered and columnar configurations and find the interaction energy v between parallel dimers; in the limit Cl \u226a\nCY , Ch , v = EhC (Cl /Ch )[(1 + CY /Ch )(1 + 3CY /Ch )]\u22122 .\nSecond, we have checked that the electrostatic energies\n\nof the liquid phase dimer configurations indeed scale (to\nwithin \u223c 5% accuracy) with the number of parallel dimer\npairs. The condition Cl \u226a CY guarantees a short range\ninteraction between dimers.\nI h , Ch\n\nIh , C h\nflip\n\nC\n\ni\n\nCY\n\nIl ,C l\nflip\n\nC\n\nJJT\n\n*\n\nCX\n\nJJK\n\nFIG. 3. Josephson junctions arrays forming triangular\n(JJT) and Kagome (JJK) lattices and emulating dimer systems. JJT: The large capacitance Ch joins hexagonal islands into electric units which are frustrated by a global\ngate to accept 1/2 Cooper pair. Cooper pairs resonating between hexagonal islands form dimers (shaded ellipses);\ndimer flips due to Ht are indicated by arrows. JJK: Cooper\npairs on X-shaped islands are capacitively coupled through\nstar-shaped islands. The gate is tuned to allow for 1/2 Cooper\npair per hexagon. Dimers are pairs residing on X-shaped islands and polarizing adjacent star-shaped islands.\n\nThe backbone of the second array (JJK) is made from\nX-shaped islands arranged into a Kagome lattice with\ncapacitive and Josephson couplings EhC and EhJ , see Fig.\n3. A second triangular lattice of star-shaped islands introduced into the hexagons of the Kagome lattice is only\ncapacitively coupled (with energy EiC ) to the islands of\nthe Kagome lattice; CX and C\u2217 denote the capacitances\nof the islands to the ground. The Kagome sites are biased with a global external gate to accept one additional\nCooper pair per hexagon at equal energy, resulting in a\nfilling with 1/2 Cooper pair per hexagon. The similarity between the Kagome lattice and the triangular array\nbecomes obvious when joining pairs of Y-shaped islands\n(corresponding to the limit Cl \u2192 \u221e and Il \u2192 \u221e) and\ncontracting the link to obtain the X-shaped island - the\nprevious vertex junctions now play the role of the junctions on the Kagome lattice, hence the same index 'h'\nhas been chosen for the junctions on the hexagons; note\nthat the present array involves only one type of Josephson\njunctions. By analogy, dimers now correspond to Cooper\npairs localized onto the X-islands of the Kagome lattice.\nAs dimers should not touch one another, no two bosons\nare allowed on the same hexagon: We choose small capacitances Ch in order to isolate hexagons from one another (note the difference to the JJT array) and large\ncapacitances Ci to join the six X-shaped islands forming\nthe hexagon into one electrostatic unit via their strong\ncoupling to the central star-shaped island. The capacitances CX , C\u2217 , and Ci then define the charging energy\nrequired to put two Cooper pairs on the same hexagon,\nEhex \u2248 (Ci /CX )2 E\u2217C , which is our basic energy scale (we\n4\n\n\fassume Ci < C\u2217 , CX in order to guarantee good screening\non large distances).\nThe motion of the Cooper pairs (the dimer dynamics) involves the hopping amplitude EhJ and the charging\nenergy Ehex of the virtual state with two Cooper pairs\non the same hexagon, t \u223c EhJ 2 /Ehex ; note that we require EhJ \u226a Ehex not to perturb the proper frustration of\nthe array. The interaction energy v again derives from a\ncomparison between the staggered and columnar states\nand has to meet the conflicting requirements of increasing the energy of parallel dimers (next-nearest neighbor\ninteraction) while leaving non-parallel dimer pairs (nextnext-nearest neighbor interaction) approximately unperturbed. In order to produce a positive v we need a finite\ncoupling Ch , which in turn reduces the basic energy Ehex .\nWe find that the set 5Ci = C\u2217 = CX = 20Ch produces\nr\na (renormalized) protective energy Ehex\n\u2248 0.008E\u2217C \u2248\nr\n0.2Ehex and a repulsive energy v \u2248 0.1Ehex . Choosing\nr\nEhJ \u2248 0.3Ehex\nwe can properly satisfy the condition t \u2248 v.\nWe construct a topologically protected qubit from the\ntwo-level system defined by the two ground states of a\nquantum dimer system with cylindrical boundary conditions. We make use of the above Josephson junction\narrays and a ring geometry; the two qubit states |ei and\n|oi then are distinct through the parity of the dimer count\nalong the line \u03b3 joining the inner and outer boundaries\nof the array, see Fig. 4. In order to manipulate the qubit\nwe have to implement the qubit Hamiltonian\nHqubit = hx \u03c3x + hz \u03c3z ,\n\na\n\nb\n\nqubit\n\n\u03b3\n\nGSS\n\n\u03a6\namplitude shifter\n\nphase\nshifter\n\nGSS\n\nFIG. 4. a The topologically protected qubit involves the\ntwo degenerate groundstates of the quantum dimer liquid\nstate realized within a triangular Josephson junction array.\nThe qubit's phase is manipulated through the gated superconducting strip (GSS) attracting dimers along \u03b3. The amplitude shifter mixing the groundstates is realized with the\nhelp of a tunable Josephson junction placed at the inner qubit\nboundary. Dimer-flips, like a row of falling dominos, take the\nhole around the inner boundary. b Array of topologically protected qubits embedded in a Josephson junction array emulating a dimer system. The entanglement of two qubits proceeds\nthrough coupling over a gated superconducting strip.\n\nThe 'phase shifter' can be implemented through a\ngated superconducting strip, capacitively coupled to the\narray and attracting dimers onto the reference line \u03b3.\nUpon biasing the strip, the energies of the two groundstates are shifted with respect to one another and the\nqubit's phase \u03c7 is modified accordingly. The implementation requires careful adiabatic switching, with the amplitude u (the energy acting on one dimer) and the duration \u03c4 of the manipulation limited by the constraints\nu \u223c t \u226a ElJ and \u03c4 > h\u0304/\u2206 in order to avoid excitations\nwithin the dimer liquid. Furthermore, we have to break\nup the strip during idle time, as the fully connected strip\nrepresents a global operator (otherwise, electric fluctuations fed to the strip would decohere the system). Thus\nthe strip has to be constructed from isolated superconducting islands which are to be connected only during the\ntime where the phase shifter becomes operational. Fast\nswitches accomplishing such a connection can be built\nfrom superconducting Cooper pair transistors [25].\nThe qubit's manipulation involve strong modifications\nof the system: the amplitude shifter requires leaving the\nprotected Hilbert space through virtual breaking of a\ndimer, while the phase shifter requires introduction of\na global operator. In turn, these processes are strongly\ninhibited during idle time and give the qubit its robustness: amplitude mixing is exponentially small in Lx while\nphase drifting is exponentially small in Ly , cf. (4).\nConstructing a register of qubits is surprisingly simple:\nthe same basic Josephson junction array can accommodate K qubits in a geometry with K holes, see Fig. 4.\nIndividual qubit operations are carried out as described\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c3x and \u03c3z are Pauli matrizes and hx , hz are\nthe (manipulable) parameters producing the amplitude\n(\u03b1) and phase (\u03c7) mixing\nin the qubit state |\u03b1, \u03c7i =\n\u221a\n[ |ei + \u03b1 exp(i\u03c7)|oi ]/ 1 + \u03b12 . The implementation of hx\nrequires a controlled mixing of the protected dimer states,\nimplying a reduction of the ground state's topological\nprotection. In the JJT array this is achieved by breaking one dimer bond and creation of a virtual particlehole excitation where one Cooper pair retreats to one\nhexagon (particle), leaving the partner hexagon empty\n(hole). This virtual excitation costs the energy \u1ebclJ of\nthat particular bond and takes the system (virtually) out\nof the protected dimer space. While the particle remains\npinned to the weak junction, the hole is taken around the\ninner boundary through appropriate dimer flips and is\nsubsequently recombined with the particle. This process\nresults in a mixing amplitude hx \u223c EhJ (EhJ /\u1ebclJ )M , where\nM denotes the number of links on the inner boundary\n(this estimate applies to the 'optimal' dimer configuration shown in Fig. 4). Hence introducing one switchable\nlink junction near the inner boundary allows us to tune\nthe parameter \u1ebclJ and change the mixing amplitude hx\nby many orders of magnitude. The variant for the JJK\narray involves a virtual excitation with two Cooper pairs\non one hexagon.\n5\n\n\fabove. The implementation of a non-trivial two-qubit\noperation again involves a superconducting strip: biasing the strip connecting two qubits lifts the energy of the\nstates |e oi and |o ei with respect to the states |e ei and\n|o oi and combining this two-qubit 'phase shifter' with\na suitable set of single qubit operations allows for the\nconstruction of the controlled-NOT operation [8].\nIn a first step towards the implementation of topologically protected qubits one may wish to test the proper\nfunctionality of the quantum Josephson junction array.\nSuch a test is provided by a measurement of the magnetic susceptibility \u03c7 of the ring-shaped structure: applying a magnetic field, the mixing energy hx picks up a\nfactor cos(2\u03c0\u03a6/\u03a60 ), where \u03a60 = hc/e is the normal state\nflux quantum. This factor originates from the AharonovBohm phase picked up by the virtual charged excitations\nencircling the hole. In the absence of disorder the ring's\nenergy changes with flux, Ering (\u03a6) = hx | cos(2\u03c0\u03a6/\u03a60 )|,\n2\nresulting in a suceptibility \u03c7 \u221d \u2202\u03a6\nEring with period\n\u03a60 /2 and a sharp feature at \u03a6 = \u03a60 /4. The splitting \u2206d in the groundstate energies (due to disorder or\nfinite-size effects) smears this sharp feature over a region\n\u03b4\u03a6/\u03a60 \u223c \u2206d /hx ; hence a measurement of \u03c7(\u03a6) allows\nto check on the mixing amplitude hx and on the level\nsplitting.\nA particular challenge faced by qubit implementations\nbased on Josephson junctions operating in the charge\nlimit is the presence of stray charges [5,9]; the robustness in our device efficiently suppresses fluctuations in\nthe gate potential once they drop below t. The problem\nof stray charges is avoided in designs using the dual phase\nvariable [7,8,11] and work in this direction is in progress.\nWe thank V.
