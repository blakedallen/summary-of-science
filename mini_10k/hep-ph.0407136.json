Vijande, F. Fern\u00e1ndez, A. Valcarce\nNuclear Physics Group,\nUniversity of Salamanca,\nPlaza de la Merced s/n, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain\n\nReceived (Day Month Year)\nRevised (Day Month Year)\nDespite the apparent simplicity of meson spectroscopy there are some states which cannot\nbe accommodated in the usual q q\u0304 structure. Among them there are either exotic states\n\u2217 and X(3872) and some of\nas the X(1600) or the recently measured charm states DsJ\nthe light scalar mesons. In this work we present a possible description of these states in\nterms of tetraquarks.\nKeywords: nonrelativistic quark models; meson spectrum; scalar mesons\n\nThe existence of low-energy multiquark states cannot be discarded from the\nquark model point of view. Gauging a free quark theory through the SU (3)c group\nall (q q\u0304)n (qqq)m states, being n and m integers, are allowed. Although suggested\nlong time ago1, only recently experimental evidence of the existence of these states\nhas been obtained. Apart from the widely discussed pentaquark (n = m = 1) during\nthe last years several tetraquark candidates (n = 2, m = 0) have been suggested.\nAmong them, there are states compatible with meson quantum numbers, as it is the\n\u2217\ncase of the DsJ\n's and the X(3872)2. However other structures have to be clearly\nascribed to a multiquark state as for example the X(1600), being an isospin two\nsystem3 .\nThe study of four quark systems has been done in two different directions. There\nhave been some theoretical works specifically devoted to a particular set of states4 ,\nwhile others did a more general study but in any case making a detailed comparison\nwith q q\u0304 predictions within the same model5 . The exciting scenario created by the\nnew data obtained at BaBar, CLEO, FOCUS and Belle claims for a comprehensive\nstudy where two- and four-quark states are simultaneously addressed.\nThe q\u2212q interaction used in this work has been derived from a complete study of\nthe meson spectra from the light pseudoscalars to bottomonium6 , compatible with\nthe description of N N data and the baryon spectra. To solve the four body problem\nwe perform a variational calculation considering non-quadratic terms in the radial\nwave function that were neglected in previous works7. These terms, which play\na minor role in the description of the light-heavy tetraquarks7, have an important\n1\n\n\fOctober 7, 2018 5:41 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nDescribing\n\n2\n\ninfluence in the (qq)(q\u0304 q\u0304) and (qs)(q\u0304s\u0304) tetraquarks, where q stands for u and d quarks,\nand must be included to obtain a reliable description of these states.\n1. X(1600)\nThis state has been reported with a mass of 1600 \u00b1 100 MeV8 . It has been observed\nin the reaction \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 near threshold with quantum numbers I G J P C = 2+ (2++ )9 .\nThis implies that it cannot be described as a q q\u0304 state, being therefore an exotic meson. Its quantum numbers can be easily obtained as a tetraquark made of four light\nquarks coupled to I = 2, S = 2 and L = 0. Our model predicts for this configuration\nan energy of 1544 MeV, in excellent agreement with the experimental data. Let us\nemphasize that in the tetraquark calculation there are no free parameters, all of\nthem being fixed in the N N interaction and hadron spectroscopy6.\n\u2217\n2. The charm sector: DsJ\n(2317) and X(3872)\n\u2217\nBaBar has reported a narrow state near 2317 MeV known as DsJ\n(2317)10 with\nP\n+\nquantum numbers J = 0 . Its identification with a conventional cs\u0304 quark state\nappears not possible due to its low mass2. Our results for the scalar cs\u0304 member of\n\u2217\nthe P \u2212wave triplet is 2470 MeV, too heavy to be identified with the DsJ\n(2317).\nThis state has been observed in a strong or electromagnetic decay to Ds+ \u03c0 0 so it\nmust at least contains c and s\u0304 quarks. The most obvious possibility of a tetraquark\nwill be (qc)(q\u0304s\u0304) coupled to I = 0 or 1. We have obtained for this configuration 2449\nMeV for the isovector case and 2503 MeV for the isoscalar state. Although they\n\u2217\nare still too heavy to be identified with the DsJ\n(2317), different alternatives could\nimprove the situation. The first one is a possible s\u0304c \u2194 qcq\u0304s\u0304 coupling. In this case\n\u2217\nif the mixing is fitted to reproduce the mass of the DsJ\n(2317) we obtain a 55%\ncs\u0304 component and another isoscalar state with a mass of 2655 MeV, compatible\n\u2217\nwith the recently discovered DsJ\n(2623) state at SELEX11 . A different approach\n2\nwas proposed by Barnes et al considering a possible isospin mixing. In our case\nwe can fit this mixing to obtain the experimental energy, predicting an isospin\nsymmetry breaking (58.5% for the I=1 component) and an orthogonal state with a\nmass of 2635 MeV. Although its mass is also close to the one found by SELEX this\nstrong isospin mixing is difficult to be justified within a q \u2212 q interaction. Another\npossibility would be the influence of three-body color forces12 , once included one\n\u2217\ncan obtain the mass of the DsJ\n(2317) fitting its strength.\nThe most recent of the states discovered in the charm sector is the X(3872),\nwhich was reported by Belle13 with a mass of 3872.0 \u00b1 0.6 \u00b1 0.5 MeV. One of its\nmost interesting features is that its energy is within the error bars of the D0 D0\u2217\nthreshold, 3871.5 \u00b1 0.5 MeV. Considered as a cc\u0304 state the most probable assignment\nwould be a D\u2212wave, however most of the quark models predict a somewhat lower\nmass14. Our model does not predict any q q\u0304 state compatible with this energy. Due\nto our tetraquark formalism we can only describe positive parity states7 , so we have\nstudied the (qc)(q\u0304c\u0304) with J P =1+ . We have obtained 3455 MeV for the I = 1 and\n\n\fOctober 7, 2018 5:41 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nDescribing\n\n3\n\n3786 MeV for the I = 0, both too light to be identified with the X(3872). We have\ntried the same approaches than in the previous case, but all of them would predict\nan state with an energy below 3.4 GeV which has not been observed. This seems to\nindicate that the X(3872) cannot be described as a tetraquark with J P = 1+ . Let\nus note that negative parity tetraquarks are always heavier than those with positive\nparity, so they seem to be more suitable candidates to describe this state.\n3. Light scalar sector\nThe light scalar sector cannot be described assuming only a q q\u0304 structure. Our model\npredicts a pure light content for the a0 (980), what contradicts some of the observed\ndecays, and an f0 (600) too light. Furthermore the f0 (980) and the \u03ba(800) cannot\nbe found for any combination of the parameters of the model. We have focussed our\nstudy in the a0 (980) and the f0 (980) as a tetraquark with a structure (qs)(q\u0304s\u0304). We\nobtain 1167 MeV for the isovector case and 1169 MeV for the isoscalar state with a\nquark content consistent with their experimental decays15 . This implies that these\nstates are automatically degenerated if we consider a tetraquark structure. The\ncoupling with q q\u0304 states or the inclusion of three-body color forces should help to\nimprove these results.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work has been partially funded by Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u0131\u0301a under\nContract No. BFM2001-3563, by Junta de Castilla y Le\u00f3n under Contract No. SA104/04.\nReferences\n1.
