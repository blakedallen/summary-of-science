This theorem is probably the first instance in history where an ideal is replaced by a\nbigger ideal which reflects better certain properties of the ideal in the given context. The\nintegral closure I of an ideal in a commutative ring is the biggest ideal with the property\nthat it has the same Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity as the given ideal. It was first studied by\nZariski in the context of equisingularity problems. Northcott and Rees [51] enriched this\nnotion introducing the theory of reductions and analytic spread.\nIn the last 20 years, the tight closure I \u2217 , as defined by Hochster and Huneke in positive\ncharacteristic ([35], [38]), has proved useful in homological algebra, commutative algebra,\ninvariant theory, singularity theory and algebraic geometry. Tight closure comes along\nwith plus closure (conjecturally the same), Frobenius closure, regular closure, diamond\nclosure and solid closure. It can be extended to rings containing a field of characteristic\n0 by reduction to positive characteristic and there have been several attempts to obtain\nclosure operations with similar features also in mixed characteristic ([33], [6], [30], [31],\n[32]). These constructions are related to the search for big Cohen-Macaulay modules\nand algebras. Other closure operations include the weak subintegral closure, the blow-up\n1\n\n\f2\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nclosure, Ratliff's \u25b3-closure, the 2, 3-closure and the continuous closure ([67], [13], [55],\n[52], [7])\nThese closure operations have more or less natural extensions to submodules. Also, a\ncoherent subsheaf of a locally free sheaf is often replaced by its reflexive hull or by its\nsaturation in the sense that the quotient is torsion-free. Moreover, some constructions in\ncommutative algebra can be thought of as a closure of 0 inside an R-module M , like its\ntorsion or the submodule of sections with support inside a given closed subset of Spec R, as\nit is used in the definition of local cohomology. The idea of torsion has been systematically\nstudied under the name of hereditary torsion theories in the categorial context, but in\nparticular for modules over a ring ([3], [16]).\nOn the other hand, Grothendieck topologies, in particular the \u00e9tale topology for schemes,\nwere introduced to give for varieties over a finite field a suitable replacement for the complex topology, in order to define algebraically a cohomology theory with similar properties\nas the singular cohomology in algebraic topology ([1], [24], [49]). This development culminated in Deligne's proof of the Weil conjectures.\nThe concept of a Grothendieck topology axiomatizes the idea of an open set and of\ncoverings. However, the open sets need neither be subsets nor is a covering something\nwhich can be tested by containment of points. Instead, coverings are given as a collection\nof morphisms Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U , i \u2208 I, fulfilling certain structural conditions, and points need not\nto exist at all. With this notion of coverings at hand, one can talk about local and global\nproperties and one can define presheaves, sheaves, sheafification, exactness and cohomology.\nThe basic idea of this (and subsequent) paper is to describe closure operations for ideals\nand submodules over a commutative ring R as a sheafification procedure in a suitable\nGrothendieck topology over X = Spec R. More generally, for a morphism between ringed\nsites (i.e. categories with a Grothendieck topology and a sheaf of rings) we can talk about\nextension and contraction of modules and hence of a closure operation. For R-modules\nN \u2286 M , a Grothendieck topology on X -denoted by Xtop - yields sheafified Otop -modules\nNtop \u2212\n\u2192 Mtop on Xtop and an image sheaf N top \u2286 Mtop . Then we declare for s \u2208 M\nthat s \u2208 N c if and only if \u03b8(s) \u2208 \u0393(Xtop , N top ), where \u03b8 : M \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(Xtop , Mtop ) is the\nsheafification homomorphism. This means, in a certain sense, that s \u2208 N c holds if \"s \u2208 N \"\nholds locally in the Grothendieck topology, and this means that it holds for a covering. In\nparticular, s \u2208 0c , if s = 0 holds locally in the topology.\nThe classical Grothendieck topologies, like the Zariski, the flat and the \u00e9tale topology\n(this is also true for the Nisnevich topology [50], which is between the Zariski and the\n\u00e9tale topology, and for the primitive topology of M. Walker [69]) do not yield in this way\nanything new, i.e. N c = N . This is due to the fact that the assignment V 7\u2192 \u0393(V, j \u2217 N )\nfor j : V \u2212\n\u2192 X = Spec R flat (denoted by W (M ) in [24, Example VII.2c)] and in [49]),\nis already a sheaf in the flat topology [49, Proposition I.2.18 and Corollary II.1.6], and\nsince a faithfully flat homomorphism R \u2212\n\u2192 S is pure, which means that M \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2297R S is\ninjective for every R-module M . If \u03c6 : R \u2212\n\u2192 S is however not pure, then the inclusion\nI \u2282 \u03c6\u22121 (IS) might be strict, and if we declare \u03c6 to be a covering, then \u03c6(f ) \u2208 IS says\nthat f belongs locally to the ideal I, hence to I c .\nLets explain more concretely how a Grothendieck topology induces a closure operation\nand what properties it has. Lets restrict for simplicity in this introduction to the affine\nsingle-handed case. This means that we have a category of R-algebras, closed under\ncomposition and tensor product, and certain R-algebra homomorphisms are declared to\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n3\n\nbe covers (so all coverings consist of just one morphism). In this situation the closure\noperation given by sheafification in the topology boils down to saying that for f \u2208 R\nand an ideal I \u2286 R the containment f \u2208 I c holds if and only if there exists a cover\n\u03c6:R\u2212\n\u2192 S such that \u03c6(f ) \u2208 IS. More generally, for R-submodules N \u2286 M and s \u2208 M ,\nthe containment s \u2208 N c holds if and only there exists such a cover such that s \u2297 1 is in the\nimage of N \u2297R S \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2297R S. It follows immediately that N \u2286 N c = (N c )c holds and that\nthe closure operation is order preserving, that is for N \u2286 N \u2032 in M one has N c \u2286 (N \u2032 )c .\nA great deal of this project is in finding the right concept of covers for a given closure\noperation and to study properties of these morphisms instead (or rather as a way) of\nstudying the closure operation. For some closure operations it is immediately clear which\nring homomorphisms should be considered to be a cover, but not for all. We go through\nthe closure operations which we will deal with in this and in subsequent papers ([4], [5],\n[7], [8]) and we describe the natural covers for them.\nLet's look first at the Frobenius closure in positive characteristic p, which is defined by\ne\nf \u2208 I F if and only if there exists a power of the Frobenius \u03a6e : R \u2212\n\u2192 R, f 7\u2192 f p , such\ne\ne\nthat f p \u2208 \u03a6e (I) =: I [p ] . In this case one wants to allow exactly the \u03a6e to be covers\nto define the Frobenius topology. However, in order to get a theory with good properties\nregarding base change and also to have only covers of finite type, it is better to define a\nhomomorphism R \u2212\n\u2192 S of finite type to be a cover in the Frobenius topology if there exists\na factorization \u03a6e : R \u2212\n\u2192S\u2212\n\u2192 R for some e such that Spec R \u2212\n\u2192 Spec S is surjective.\nThe plus closure of an ideal I in a domain R consists of all elements f \u2208 R such that\nthere exists a finite extension of domains R \u2286 S with f \u2208 IS. Here the appropriate\nconcept of a cover, which works also for rings with zero divisors, is to impose that R \u2212\n\u2192S\nis finite and with surjective morphism Spec S \u2212\n\u2192 Spec R. This gives the finite topology.\nWhat is the appropriate concept of a cover for the radical of an ideal (and what is the\nradical of a submodule)? If we take Hilbert's Nullstellensatz as our guide, then f belongs\nto rad(I) if and only if V (f ) \u2287 V (I) in Spec R. This means for all prime ideals I \u2286 p\nthat also f \u2208 p holds, or that all homomorphisms R \u2212\n\u2192 \u03ba(p) which map I to 0 also map\nf to 0. This property is then true for all homomorphisms from R to a field. Which ring\nhomomorphisms R \u2212\n\u2192 S behave nicely with respect to homomorphism to fields? There\nare several possibilities, but we will use the fact that Spec S \u2212\n\u2192 Spec R is surjective if and\nonly if for all R \u2212\n\u2192 K we have S\u2297R K 6= 0 (or Spec(S\u2297R K) 6= \u2205).\nDeclaring spec-surjective morphisms to be covers is in fact a way to obtain the radical\nvia a Grothendieck topology, the surjective topology. For, if R \u2212\n\u2192 S is spec-surjective\nand f \u2208 IS, then for all homomorphisms to a field \u03c8 : R \u2212\n\u2192 K it follows by the faithful\nflatness of K \u2212\n\u2192 S\u2297R K (6= 0) that \u03c8(f ) \u2208 IK. Hence if IK = 0, then also \u03c8(f ) = 0.\nFor the other direction we have to construct for f \u2208 rad(I) a spec-surjective homomorphism \u03c6 : R \u2212\n\u2192 S with \u03c6(f ) \u2208 IS. For this we use forcing algebras, as introduced\nby Hochster [33] in connection with solid closure in an (at the end not successful) attempt to construct a closure operation in all characteristics with tight closure properties [33]. Fix ideal generators I = (f1 , . . . , fn ). The forcing algebra for these data is\nB = R[T1 , . . . , Tn ]/(f1 T1 + . . . + fn Tn + f ). In B, f \u2208 IB holds, and every R-algebra S\nwith f \u2208 IS factors (non uniquely) through B. It is clear by this property that forcing\nalgebras should play an important role in the study of closure operations. In the context\nof the radical, f \u2208 rad(I) holds if and only if the corresponding forcing algebra induces a\nspec-surjective morphism.\n\n\f4\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nThere are several equivalent characterizations of the integral closure of an ideal. If R\nis noetherian, then f \u2208 I if and only if f \u2208 IV for all ring homomorphisms R \u2212\n\u2192 V to\ndiscrete valuation domains. Hence a forcing algebra Spec B \u2212\n\u2192 Spec R should declared to\nbe a cover if and only if for all Spec V \u2212\n\u2192 Spec R there exists a lifting Spec V \u2212\n\u2192 Spec B.\nFor forcing algebras, but not in general, this path-lifting property is equivalent to say that\nfor every R \u2212\n\u2192 V the homomorphism V \u2212\n\u2192 B\u2297R V has a V -module section or that it\nis pure. There exists even a topological characterization for an V -algebra T to be pure,\nnamely that over the prime ideals in Spec V , i.e. 0 \u2282 mV , there exists a pair of prime\nideals q \u2282 p in Spec T mapping to 0 and mV respectively.\nThis topological observation ties in purity after base change to discrete valuation domains with submersions. A submersion \u03c6 : Spec S \u2212\n\u2192 Spec R is a surjective mapping\nsuch that the Zariski topology of Spec R is the image (or quotient) topology under the\nmorphism, that is, a subset W \u2286 Spec R is open if and only if its preimage \u03c6\u22121 (W ) is\nopen. This definition can be found in SGA 1 (see [23, D\u00e9finition IX.2.1] and [21, D\u00e9finition\n3.10.1]) and also in [68, Definition 3.1.1] under the name of topological epimorphism. A\nmorphism \u03c6 : Spec S \u2212\n\u2192 Spec R (R noetherian) is universally submersive if and only if for\nall R \u2212\n\u2192 V to discrete valuation domains V \u2212\n\u2192 S\u2297R V is pure ([23, Remarque IX.2.6], [53,\nTh\u00e9or\u00e8me 37]). Hence the submersive topology, in which the universal submersions are\ncovers, gives a Grothendieck topology which induces the integral closure. Surprisingly, this\ntopology is very closely related to Voevodsky's h-topology, which arose as a new approach\nto understand the algebraic topology of varieties and which was the first systematic study\nof a non-flat Grothendieck topology ([68], [64]). We will study submersions and integral\nclosure in a separate paper [4].\nRecall that for a ring of positive characteristic p the tight closure of an ideal I is by\ndefinition I \u2217 = {f \u2208 R : there exists z \u2208 Ro , zf q \u2208 I [q] for all q = pe }, where Ro denotes\nthe complement of all minimal primes. Tight closure agrees in positive characteristic (if\nR has a completely stable test element) with solid closure [33, Theorem 8.6]. This means\nthat the containment f \u2208 I \u2217 for an m-primary ideal I, where m is a maximal ideal of\nheight d, is characterized by the property that the local cohomology module Hmd (B) is not\nzero, where B is the forcing algebra [33, Corollary 2.4]. This property makes sense in every\n(even mixed) characteristic, leading to solid closure in general and to the solid topology. It\nis however known that for rings containing a field of characteristic 0 solid closure does not\nexhibit all features one expects from a tight closure type theory, in particular, ideals in a\nregular ring are not always solidly closed [60]. A variant of solid closure, called parasolid\nclosure, introduced in [6], is defined characteristic free by the property that all cohomology\nclasses 1/g1 * * * gd \u2208 Hmd (R), where g1 , . . . , gd is a system of parameters in R, do not vanish\nin Hmd (B). We will continue the search for the tight topology along these lines in [5].\nAnother source for closure operations is given by torsion theories. Torsion theories\nhave been studied in various categorial contexts; for the category of R-modules over a\ncommutative ring it means that we have two classes T and F of modules ('torsion modules'\nand 'torsion-free modules' in an abstract sense) such that T is closed under quotients and\nF is closed under submodules and such that for every R-module M there exists a short\nexact sequence 0 \u2212\n\u2192 T \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2212\n\u2192 F \u2212\n\u2192 0 (T \u2208 T , F \u2208 F). In particular then, every\nmodule has a biggest torsion submodule, and this can be considered as the closure of 0. A\ntorsion theory is called hereditary if the torsion class is also closed under submodules.\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n5\n\nA hereditary torsion theory is basically given by its so-called Gabriel filter, which consists of all ideals J \u2286 R such that R/J is torsion. In the noetherian case, this Gabriel\nfilter is stable under radical, so it is essentially a (Zariski-)topological filter. Such a Zariski\nfilter gives rise to a (non-affine) Grothendieck topology, where the Zaiski open subset\nV \u2286 Spec R is said to be a cover if V belongs to this filter. So here the covers are flat, but\nthey are not surjective. This is quite a natural construction, since the relevant information\nlies often already in certain open subsets, like e.g. the divisor class group depends only on\npoints of codimension one. The induced closure of a submodule N consists of all s \u2208 M\nsuch that the restriction s|V \u2208 N for some open subset in the filter. For N = 0 and one\nfixed U = D(a) this also equals \u0393V (a) (M ) = \u0393a (M ), the module of sections with support\nin V (a), as used in the definition of local cohomology. In general, a typical feature for\nhereditary torsion theories is that the closure operation 0 7\u2192 0c is left exact.\nSo for a lot of closure operations we can describe a Grothendieck topology which induces\nit, but one can also give an exact characterization of the closures for which one can\nconstruct a Grothendieck topology. This construction uses again forcing algebras. Assume\nthat f \u2208 (f1 , . . . , fn )c in a given closure operation c. Then it is natural to declare the\ncorresponding forcing algebra B to be a cover. It may then happen that g \u2208 JB, where\nJ is another ideal, so g will belong to the induced closure of J in every topology where\nR\u2212\n\u2192 B is a cover. So in order that this construction does not produce to many elements in\nthe closure we need that g \u2208 J c . We express this requirement by saying that c-admissible\nforcing algebras must be c-pure. This property characterizes exactly the closure operations\nwhich come from a Grothendieck topology. It implies that the closure is module persistent,\ni.e. for a module homomorphism \u03c6 : M \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2032 one has \u03c6(N c ) \u2286 \u03c6(N )c and that it is\nindependent of the presentation, i.e. if \u03c6 : M \u2212\n\u2192 M/N , then N c = \u03c6\u22121 (0c ).\nAn important feature of closure operations are persistence properties with respect to ring\nchanges, which should be reflected by the Grothendieck topologies. A closure operation\nis said to be persistent with respect to a class of ring homomorphisms if for \u03c6 : R \u2212\n\u2192S\nand I \u2286 R one has \u03c6(I c ) \u2286 \u03c6(I)c . Most closure operations mentioned above (with the\nexception of torsion theories) are persistent with respect to all ring homomorphisms; for\ntight closure this is a non-trivial fact. If we have a Grothendieck topology on a category\nof rings, then a ring homomorphism R \u2212\n\u2192 S might or might not respect the Grothendieck\ntopology, i.e. induces a site morphism (Spec S)top \u2212\n\u2192 (Spec R)top or not. If it does, then\nthe closure operation is persistent with respect to this homomorphism.\nAfter having explained how a Grothendieck topology induces a closure operation we\nshall look now at some other features which a Grothendieck topology provides. Some\nof these features have occurred in the study of closure operations in some disguise, and\nGrothendieck topologies give a conceptual view on these.\nThe containment in the Frobenius closure can also be expressed by saying that f \u2208 IR\u221e ,\nwhere R\u221e is the perfect closure of R. The containment in the plus closure is equivalent with\nf \u2208 IR+ , where R+ is the integral closure of R in an algebraic closure of its quotient field\nQ(R) (R a domain), called the absolute integral closure. The study of tight closure is closely\nrelated to the search for big Cohen-Macaulay modules or algebras. The common feature\nhere is that there exists one \"big\" algebra which encompasses in a certain sense all relevant\ncovers, like in topology the universal covering space encompasses all unramified covers.\nWe systemize this observation with the concept of an absolute filter in a Grothendieck\ntopology, at which we can evaluate a (pre-)sheaf to get an absolute stalk. This is similar\n\n\f6\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nto the \u00e9tale topology of a local ring, where a suitable colimit over all \u00e9tale covers yields\nthe strict Henselization of the ring. An absolute stalk should carry essentially the whole\ninformation of the Grothendieck topology and of the closure operation, but its construction\nand its explicit description might be difficult, and its functorial properties are weak in\ngeneral.\nA Grothendieck topology provides a concept of exactness for a complex of R-modules\nN \u2212\n\u2192M \u2212\n\u2192 L, namely the exactness of the complex of sheaves Ntop \u2212\n\u2192 Mtop \u2212\n\u2192 Ltop\non the underlying category of the Grothendieck topology. This notion depends not only\non the concept of a covering, but also on the seize of the category. Quite often we will\nwork with a small site, where (roughly speaken) only objects occur which are relevant\nfor some covering of the final object Spec R. This exactness on the small site is still a\nstrong condition and we will also consider weaker notions which are closely related to\nthe property that the kernel in the complex of modules is contained in the closure of the\nimage. This property has been studied in tight closure theory under the name of phantom\nhomology [38, Chapter 10] and for the integral closure (for the Koszul complex) by D.\nKatz [41]. In the surjective topology, the sheaf exactness is equivalent to the property\nthat N \u2297R K \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2297R K \u2212\n\u2192 L\u2297R K is exact for every ring homomorphism R \u2212\n\u2192 K to a\nfield.\nA Grothendieck topology on X = Spec R gives also for an R-module M via sheafification\na global module of sections, namely \u0393(Xtop , Mtop ) (with a homomorphism from M to\nit), and in particular a global ring of sections \u0393(Xtop , Otop ). An element in this ring is\nrepresented by a compatible element f \u2208 S, where R \u2212\n\u2192 S is a cover and where compatible\nmeans that f \u2297 1 \u2212 1 \u2297 f \u2208 S\u2297R S is 0 in the topology, i.e. in some cover S\u2297R S \u2212\n\u2192 T.\nThe assignment R 7\u2192 \u0393(Xtop , Otop ) is functorial for ring homomorphisms S \u2212\n\u2192 S which\nrespect the Grothendieck topology.\nFor the Frobenius topology this construction yields the perfect closure, since for f \u2208 eR\nthe element f \u2297 1 \u2212 1 \u2297 f is nilpotent. In this case the ring of global sections equals\nthe absolute stalk. In the surjective topology (in characteristic 0), a global function is\nessentially given by an affine constructible partition X = V1 \u228e . . . \u228e Vk , where Vi is an\nintersection of a closed and an open subset, and functions fi \u2208 \u0393(Vi , OVi ) (an absolute\nstalk is given as the product of the algebraic closures of all residue class fields).\nFor other topologies the ring of global sections is closer to the ring itself, e.g. for\nthe plus closure and in the submersive topology (in characteristic 0), it is the so-called\nseminormalization. In particular, f \u2208 I c does not mean that f \u2208 I\u0393(Xtop , Otop ), which is\na global and much stronger condition.\nAs the module of global sections is the 0th cohomology, we arrive at sheaf cohomology in general. Cohomology can be defined quite generally via injective resolutions,\nand at least the first cohomology might be computed by \u010cech cohomology. The cohomology of a coherent OX -module over an affine scheme might be non-trivial, contrary to the flat, \u00e9tale or Zariski topology. A typical short exact sequence arises from\nf1 ,...,fn\n\nn\n\u2212\n\u2192 I top \u2212\n\u2192 0, where\nideal generators I = (f1 , . . . , fn ) and gives 0 \u2212\n\u2192 Syz \u2212\n\u2192 Otop\ntop\nI\n\u2286 Otop is the image sheaf of Itop inside Otop and where Syz is defined as the\nkernel of the surjection (not as Syztop ). The corresponding long cohomology sequence\n\nis 0 \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(Xtop , Syz) \u2212\n\u2192 \u2295n \u0393(Xtop , Otop )\n\nf1 ,...,fn\n\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\n\u0393(Xtop , I top ) \u2212\n\u2192 H 1 (Xtop , Syz) \u2212\n\u2192\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n7\n\n\u2295n H 1 (Xtop , Otop ). In the case of the Frobenius topology and of the surjective topology we can prove that H 1 (Xtop , Otop ) = 0 and also that H 1 (Xtop , Syz) = 0, and so all\nf \u2208 I c come from a 'global solution' f \u2208 I\u0393(Xtop , Otop ).\nIn cases where \u0393(Xtop , Otop ) = R we have \u0393(Xtop , I top ) = I c \u2286 R and the image from\nthe left is I\u0393(Xtop , Otop ) = I, so I c /I \u2286 H 1 (Xtop , Syz), which is a bijection provided\nthat H 1 (Xtop , Otop ) = 0. We expect this to hold in the submersive topology for a normal\ndomain in characteristic 0. The relation between the first cohomology of the sheaf of\nsyzygies and the closure quotient I c /I extends to a relation between the naive sequence\n0\u2212\n\u2192 I c /I \u2212\n\u2192 R/I \u2212\n\u2192 R/I c \u2212\n\u2192 0 and the long exact sequence . . . \u2212\n\u2192 H 1 (Xtop , Syz) \u2212\n\u2192\n1\n2\n\u2192 . . . relating local and global cohomology, where\nH (Utop , Syz) \u2212\n\u2192 HXtop \u2212Utop (Syz) \u2212\nU = D(I).\nIf a closure operation or a Grothendieck topology is defined for a class of rings (usually\nthe class of all noetherian rings), then it is natural to ask for which rings the Grothendieck\ntopology is pure and the closure is trivial. Purity means here that the sheafification does\nnot annihilate anything, and for a single-handed Grothendieck topology it just means that\nevery cover is pure. A stronger condition is that every cover allows a module section or\neven that every cover allows a ring section, like in the \u00e9tale topology the algebraically\nsimply connected varieties are characterized by the property that every \u00e9tale cover has\na section. The class of rings (or singularities) which are pure with respect to a certain\nGrothendieck topology might be quite significant, which is in particular true for tight\nclosure, where the so-called F -regular rings are closely related to rational singularities.\nWe believe that Grothendieck topologies provide a natural framework to study closure\noperations. It gives a conceptual view on certain features which have been loosely accompanying closure operations ever since (like exactness or absolute covers). Once the 'right'\nGrothendieck topology for a given closure operation for ideals is found we can immediately\nextend the closure to submodules.\nThe focus on morphisms coming along with studying the appropriate coverings brings in\na geometric flavor to questions on closure of ideals. For example, the complex-topological\ncharacterization of submersions yields at once the complex-analytic characterization of\nthe integral closure of submodules. Also, statements on closures have often natural generalizations to morphisms, in such a way that the original statement is regained by looking\nat the morphisms given by forcing algebras.\nGrothendick topologies provide also a new way to construct closure operations. Here\nthe most challenging problem is to give in mixed characteristic an operation with similar\nproperties as tight closure. This would solve most remaining homological conjectures.\nLess ambitious is the task to give a tight closure like operation in equal characteristic\nzero without reduction to positive characteristic. This was essentially accomplished in [6],\nbut a complex-analytic characterization extending the relation between tight closure test\nideals and multiplier ideals remains to be done.\nWe give a brief summary of the content and the structure of this paper.\nWe start in part 1 with the concepts of Grothendieck topologies, sheaves (1.1), sheafification (1.2) and of morphisms of (ringed) sites (1.3). A morphism of (ringed) sites is\nthe natural setting in which it makes sense to talk about extensions and contractions of\n(sub-)modules, which gives a closure operation (1.4). This approach has the advantage\nof being a relative setting, so that we can sheafifiy and get the closures in several steps.\nLater on our site morphisms will be between a scheme with its Zariski topology (or even\n\n\f8\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nits trivial topology, where only isomorphisms are coverings) and another larger (or finer)\ntopology. In (1.5) we discuss such Grothendieck topologies on a scheme and how a module defines a (pre-)sheaf. In (1.6) we discuss modules of global sections and provide some\nlemmata which will later be of use in computations for several Grothendieck topologies.\nStarting with (1.7) we look at filters in a Grothendieck topology and the stalks they\nlead to. Basically, a filter is a cofiltered system (or diagram) in the topology. An easy way\nto produce filters is by a fixation (Construction 1.7.2). In some sense, a filter, and in particular the irreducible ones, are a replacement for points (1.8). A filter which consists only\nof covers and has the property that for every cover it has a factorization is called absolute\n(1.9). They carry in some sense the whole information of the Grothendieck topology. In\n(1.10) we discuss several notions of exactness and in (1.11) we discuss cohomology, \u010cech\ncohomology and local cohomology in a site. It might be a good idea to read initially only\n(1.4) of the first part and go back if needed.\nThe second part relates Grothendieck topologies on a scheme, in particular on an affine\nscheme, with closure operations. In (2.1) we start with the basics about forcing algebras.\nIn (2.2) we introduce admissible closure operations which will turn out to be the ones\nfor which one can construct a Grothendieck topology. We also introduce certain finiteness conditions for a closure operation. In (2.3) we give examples of admissible closure\noperations and also of non-admissible closures like the Ratliff-Rush closure. In (2.4) we\ndescribe, on the basis of (1.4), how a Grothendieck topology on a scheme induces an admissible closure operation. In (2.5) we characterize the pure topologies and in (2.6) we\nconstruct for a given admissible closure a Grothendieck topology which induces it. In (2.7)\nwe relate the notion of exactness with properties of the closure, and in (2.8) we deal with\nthe sheaf of syzygies and how the closure operation is reflected in the cohomology of this\nsheaf.\nThe following parts are dedicated in detail to specific closure operations and their\n\"natural\" Grothendieck topologies and can be read independently from each other.\nPart 3 deals with the radical and the surjective topology. In (3.1) we recall the radical\nof an ideal and introduce the radical of a submodule. The surjective topology is introduced\nin (3.2) and it is shown that it induces the radical (Proposition 3.2.3). In (3.3) we discuss\nthe Jacobson radical and the Jacobson topology, where a cover need only be surjective on\nthe closed points. It follows from a version of the Nakayama Lemma that for a finitely\ngenerated module the Jacobson radical and the radical is not the whole module (Corollary\n3.3.8). In (3.4) we deal with the surjective topology over a field and show that the ring\nof global sections is the perfect closure of the field. Note that though over a field a ring\nis faithfully flat if and only if it is spec-surjective, the surjective topology over a field is\nnot the same as the faithfully flat topology, since also the covers of A \u2297K A are crucial for\nthe topology. In (3.5) we show that the direct product over the algebraic closures of all\nresidue class fields of Spec R provides an absolute stalk (Proposition 3.5.1).\nIn (3.6) we discuss constructible partitions of a scheme, which are the easiest non-trivial\nsurjective mappings, and which are rich enough to induce also the radical. Constructible\npartitions are easier to handle than arbitrary surjections, yet they contain often the full\ninformation of the surjective topology and many questions can be reduced to the constructible topology. Section (3.7) provides some lemmata for this. In (3.8) we show that\nthe ring of global sections in the surjective topology for a ring of finite (Krull) dimension\nover a field of characteristic 0 is the same as in the constructible topology (Theorem 3.8.2).\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n9\n\nSo a global function is given by a collection of algebraic functions on a constructible partition of the scheme. The exactness in the surjective topology is characterized in (3.9) and is\nequivalent to the exactness after tensoration with an arbitrary field. It is also equivalent\nto global exactness, which is rather untypical for a Grothendieck topology. Finally, in\n(3.10) we prove that the first cohomology of coherent sheaves vanishes in the surjective\ntopology (Theorem 3.10.2 and Corollary 3.10.3).\nPart 4 deals with the Frobenius topology and the Frobenius closure in positive characteristic. In (4.1) we recall the definition of Frobenius closure of modules and in (4.2) we\nintroduce the Frobenius topology which induces the Frobenius closure (Proposition 4.2.3)\nand we characterize the purity of the Frobenius topology (Proposition 4.2.4). In (4.3) we\ncompute the ring of global sections in the Frobenius topology to be the perfect closure\n(Theorem 4.3.3). In (4.4) we characterize exactness in the Frobenius topology and in (4.5)\nwe show that the first cohomology of coherent modules vanishes (Proposition 4.5.1 and\nCorollary 4.5.2).\nPart 5 deals with the plus closure and the finite topology. In (5.1) we recall the plus\nclosure and introduce the finite topology which induces the plus closure. In (5.2) we show\nthat the ring of global sections for a domain of characteristic zero in the finite topology\nis the seminormalization, i.e. the maximal subring of the normalization which does not\nseparate points (Proposition 5.2.3). The absolute stalks in the finite topology, which are\njust products of the absolute integral closures, are described in (5.3). Our results on the\ncomputation of cohomology in the finite topology are rather modest (5.4).\nPart 6 is concerned with torsion theories and topologies given by Zariski filters. These\ntopologies are flat but not surjective (and not affine). A topological filter in the Zariski\ntopology defines a Grothendieck topology by declaring the open sets inside the filter to\nbe covers (6.1). For a filter given by just one open set the closure of 0 is nothing but the\nmodule of sections with support in the closed complement, as used in the definition of local\ncohomology (6.2). Section (6.3) provides the link between Grothendieck topologies given\nby a Zariski filter and hereditary torsion theories (Theorem 6.3.1). In (6.4) we look at the\ndivisorial topology, where the Zariski filter consists of all open subsets which contain all\npoints of codimension one. The module of global sections is under certain condition the\nreflexive hull of the module, i.e. its bidual (Lemma 6.4.2), and the closure of a submodule\ninside a reflexive module over a normal ring is also the reflexive hull (Proposition 6.4.3).\nWe also describe the relation to symbolic powers and we show that the divisor class group\nis the Picard group in the divisorial topology (Proposition 6.4.4).\nIn the final part 7 we treat some further Grothendieck topologies. In (7.1) we show\nhow to define, starting from an ideal a in a ring R, a Grothendieck topology such that\nthe ring of global sections is the a-adic completion of R. Here a covering needs infinitely\nmany objects. In (7.2) we treat the proper topology (first introduced by S.-I. Kimura in\n[42]), where a cover is given by a proper morphism. We show in Proposition 7.2.5 that\nthe induced closure is the integral closure. We will come back to this in the study of\nsubmersive topologies [4]. Section (7.3) finally studies the so-called \u25b3-closure of Ratliff,\nwhich is given by a multiplicatively closed set of ideals. This closure is induced by taking\nthe blow-ups of these ideals as covers (Proposition 7.3.1).\nWe do not touch in this paper the following topics: the topos of modules defined\nby a Grothendieck topology, e.g. structure theory for the Otop -modules, the question\nwhen scheme morphisms induce isomorphisms of sites, free resolutions in the topology,\n\n\f10\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nminimal number of generators, reductions, core, projective dimension, Picard group in\nthe Grothendieck topology (the multiplicative theory), other non-quasicoherent sheaves\nlike constant sheaves, the algebro-topological or homotopical content of the Grothendieck\ntopologies, extension problems for covers.\nI thank R.

Grothendieck topologies\n1.1. Presheaves, Grothendieck topologies and sheaves.\nAn (abelian) presheaf on a category T is a contravariant functor F : T \u2212\n\u2192 A, where A is\nthe category of abelian groups (or another abelian category). For a morphism j : U \u2212\n\u2192V\nV\nV\nwe will often denote F(j) : F(V ) \u2212\n\u2192 F(U ) by \u03c1U (j) or simply by \u03c1U and call this the\nrestriction from V to U . For a topological space, a sheaf is a presheaf which satisfies\ncertain properties with respect to coverings. To talk about sheaves in a given category\none has to define a notion of coverings with certain structural properties (see [1], [24], [49],\n[66]). This is the basic idea of a Grothendieck topology.\nRecall that a product in a category for U \u2212\n\u2192 W, V \u2212\n\u2192 W is an object U \u00d7W V with\nprojections to U and V compatible over W such that for every T \u2212\n\u2192 U, T \u2212\n\u2192 V compatible\nover W there exists a unique morphism T \u2212\n\u2192 U \u00d7W V .\nDefinition 1.1.1. Let T be a category with products. A Grothendieck topology (sometimes called a pretopology, see [24, D\u00e9finition II.1.1] or [66, Definition 2.23 and Remark\n2.24]) on T consists of a collection of coverings, that is, families \u03c6i : Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U , i \u2208 I, where\nin each family the target U \u2208 T is fixed. These coverings should satisfy.\n(i) Isomorphisms are coverings.\n(ii) If \u03c6i : Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U , i \u2208 I, and \u03c6ij : Uij \u2212\n\u2192 Ui , j \u2208 JU\ni , are coverings for every i, then\nso is the composition \u03c6i \u25e6 \u03c6ij : Uij \u2212\n\u2192 U , (i, j) \u2208 i\u2208I Ji .\n(iii) If Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U is a covering and V \u2212\n\u2192 U is any morphism in T , then V \u00d7U Ui \u2212\n\u2192V\nis a covering.\nEach covering Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U in a Grothendieck topology induces the diagram (which is the\nfirst part of the \u010cech diagram)\n]\ni,j\n\nUi \u00d7U Uj \u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\n\n]\ni\n\nUi \u2212\u2192 U\nU\n\nU\n\n\u2192 i Ui are\n(the disjoint unions do not have to exist in T ), where the arrows ij Ui \u00d7U Uj \u2212\non each open component either the first or the second projection.\nFor\na\npresheaf\nF we get\nQ\nQ\nthe \u010cech diagram of the covering with values in F, F(U ) \u2212\n\u2192 i F(Ui ) \u21d2 i,j F(Ui \u00d7U Uj ).\nDefinition 1.1.2. Let T be a Grothendieck topology. Then a presheaf F is called a sheaf,\nif for all coverings Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U in the topology the sequence\nF(U ) \u2212\u2192\n\nY\ni\u2208I\n\nF(Ui ) \u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\n\nY\n\n(i,j)\u2208I\u00d7I\n\nF(Ui \u00d7U Uj )\n\nis exact (which also means that the first map is injective).\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n11\n\nRemark 1.1.3. Explicitly, a sheaf must satisfy the following two properties.\n(i) If s \u2208 F(U ) is such that \u03c1U\nUi (s) = 0 for all i \u2208 I, then s = 0.\nU\n\nj\ni\n(ii) If si \u2208 F(Ui ) is such that (\u03c1U\nUi \u00d7U Uj (p1 ))(si ) = (\u03c1Ui \u00d7U Uj (p2 ))(sj ) for all i, j, then\nthere exists an s \u2208 F(U ) such that \u03c1U\nUi (s) = si .\nA presheaf which satisfies only the first condition is called a separated presheaf. Note that\nthe sheaf condition is in this general setting, contrary to the case of a topological space,\nalso non-trivial for a single cover V \u2212\n\u2192 U (we will usually prefer the term cover for a\ncovering consisting of only one object), because the two projections p1 , p2 : V \u00d7U V \u2212\n\u2192V\nare different.\n\n1.2. Sheafification.\nOne needs to construct a sheafification of a presheaf F, that is, a sheaf F # together\nwith a presheaf homomorphism \u03b8 : F \u2212\n\u2192 F # which is universal for homomorphisms from\nF to sheaves. That is, whenever the solid arrow to the sheaf G is given,\nG\n|> O\n|\n||\n||\n|\n| \u03b8\n/ F#\nF\n\nthe dotted arrow exists uniquely. As we will use sheafification explicitly we recall its\nconstruction. The sheafification is a two step process, see [49, Theorem II 2.11], [24,\nExpos\u00e9 II.3] or [66, Section 2.3.7]. In the first step one defines a subpresheaf F0 \u2286 F by\nF0 (U ) := {s \u2208 F(U ) : \u2203 a covering Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U, i \u2208 I, such that \u03c1U\nUi (s) = 0 \u2200i} .\n\nThen one sets F1 (U ) := F(U )/F0 (U ). This presheaf F1 is separated.\nTo describe the second step we pause to recall some categorial notions, in particular\ncolimits over a (quasi)filtered system. Beside the sheafification procedure we need this\nto define the inverse presheaf under a site morphism (Section 1.3) and to talk about\n(absolute) filters and stalks in a Grothendieck topology (Section 1.7). We are explicit\nabout this point also since not everything written down in the literature is correct (see\nExample 1.7.4).\nDefinition 1.2.1. Let \u039b ba a category. We call \u039b quasicofiltered, if the following property\nholds.\n(i) For every pair \u03bb \u2212\n\u2192 \u03bc and \u03bb\u2032 \u2212\n\u2192 \u03bc in \u039b there exists \u03ba \u2208 \u039b and morphisms \u03ba \u2212\n\u2192\u03bb\n\u2032\nand \u03ba \u2212\n\u2192 \u03bb such that the compositions are the same; and for every \u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 \u2208 \u039b there exists\n\u03ba with arrows \u03ba \u2212\n\u2192 \u03bb, \u03ba \u2212\n\u2192 \u03bb\u2032 (this follows from the first condition if \u039b has a final object).\nWe call it cofiltered if it has also the property that\n(ii) For every pair \u03c81 , \u03c82 : \u03bb \u21d2 \u03bc in \u039b there exists \u03c6 : \u03ba \u2212\n\u2192 \u03bb such that \u03c81 \u25e6 \u03c6 = \u03c82 \u25e6 \u03c6\n(so \u03c6 'unifies' the two morphisms).\nRemark 1.2.2. If the arrows are reversed the corresponding notions are called quasifiltered and filtered. A \u039b-diagram is a functor defined on a category \u039b. We will deal with\ncovariant topological diagrams which lead by evaluating a (pre)sheaf to contravariant diagrams in an abelian category. The colimit of such a contravariant diagram \u039b \u2212\n\u2192 A is the\nobject A in A characterized by the property that there exist homomorphisms \u03c1\u03bb : A\u03bb \u2212\n\u2192 A,\nwhich are compatible with respect to the homomorphisms A\u03bc \u2212\n\u2192 A\u03bb indexed by \u03bb \u2212\n\u2192 \u03bc,\n\n\f12\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nand that for every object \u00c3 in A with such compatible homomorphisms there exists a\nunique factorization A \u2212\n\u2192 \u00c3.\nThe existence of colimits and their description depend on properties of the indexing\ncategory and of the category A. Colimits exist for R-modules over a small category [12,\nProposition A 6.2]. Over a small quasifiltered category the colimit of sets is the disjoint\nunion of all sets A\u03bb modulo the equivalence relation which identifies two elements a \u2208 A\u03bb\n\u2192 A\u03ba .\nand a\u2032 \u2208 A\u03bb\u2032 if they map to the same element in some A\u03ba under \u03c8, \u03c8 \u2032 : A\u03bb , A\u03bb\u2032 \u2212\nFor a quasifiltered diagram of abelian groups (or R-modules) the colimit in the category\nof groups is different from the colimit in the category of sets ([12, Proposition A 6.3] is\nwrong, see Example 1.7.4). For a filtered diagram however the two notions coincide, and\nthe colimit in the category of groups has the easy set theoretical description.\nWe return now to the construction of the sheafification. In the second step one sets\nP + (U ) = lim \u021e(U , P) (applied then to the separated presheaf P = F1 ), where \u021e(U , P)\n\u2212\u2192\ni\nconsists of the elements si \u2208 \u0393(Ui , P) which are compatible in the sense that \u03c1U\nUi \u00d7U Uj (si ) =\nU\n\n\u03c1Uji \u00d7U Uj (sj ) and where the colimit is taken over all coverings of U ordered by refinements.\nSo the objects in the indexing category are coverings U = (Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U, i \u2208 I), and the\nmorphisms are refinements of coverings. A covering Vj \u2212\n\u2192 U , j \u2208 J, is a refinement of\nUi \u2212\n\u2192 U , i \u2208 I, if there exists a mapping \u03c8 : J \u2212\n\u2192 I and morphisms (in TX ) \u03b8j : Vj \u2212\n\u2192\nU\u03c8(j) ([49, III \u00a72] or [66, Definition 2.43]).\nA refinement V \u2212\n\u2192 U induces a homomorphism \u021e(U , P) \u2212\n\u2192 \u021e(V, P) by sending (si ),\ni \u2208 I, to (\u03b8j (s\u03c8(j) )), j \u2208 J, \u03b8j = \u03c1(\u03b8j ) : \u0393(U\u03c8(j) , P) \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(Vj , P). Because of the compatibility property this homomorphism is independent of \u03c8 and of \u03b8j [24, Corollaire V.2.3.5].\nTherefore this is a filtered diagram in the category of abelian groups (though on the topological level it is not even quasicofiltered) and its colimit equals the colimit in the category\nof sets. In particular, the homomorphisms P(U ) \u2212\n\u2192 P + (U ) are injective for a separated\npresheaf.\nCombining the two steps gives us the sheafification F # = (F1 )+ of a given presheaf F.\nIt is also true that F # = (F + )+ , but we will use the first description.\nThe kernel presheaf of a sheaf morphism G \u2212\n\u2192 F is a sheaf, but the presheaf image is not.\nThe image sheaf of a sheaf morphism is by definition the sheafification of the presheaf\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n\nimage. A complex of sheaves G \u2212\n\u2192 F \u2212\n\u2192 E is called exact if the identity of sheaves\nkern(\u03b2) = im(\u03b1) holds; this means that for every U \u2208 TX and every element s \u2208 \u0393(U, F)\nmapping to 0 in \u0393(U, E) there exists a covering Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U , i \u2208 I, and sections ti \u2208 \u0393(Ui , G),\ni \u2208 I, (without compatibility condition) mapping to the restrictions \u03c1U\nUi (s) \u2208 \u0393(Ui , F).\nWith these definitions the category of sheaves on T is an abelian category.\nA complex of presheaves is called exact if for every U in T the evaluated complex of\nabelian groups is exact. This notion is often too strong, and it is independent of the\nGrothendieck topology. We will use also the following definition.\nDefinition 1.2.3. Let T be a Grothendieck topology and let U \u2208 T be an object. Let\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n\nG\u2212\n\u2192F \u2212\n\u2192 E be a complex of presheaves of abelian groups. Then we say that the complex\nis T -exact on U or U -exact if for every s \u2208 \u0393(U, F) mapping to 0 in \u0393(U, E) there exists\na covering Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U , i \u2208 I, and sections ti \u2208 \u0393(Ui , G) mapping to the restrictions \u03c1U\nUi (s) in\n\u0393(Ui , F). We say that the complex is T -exact if it is U -exact for every U \u2208 T .\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\u03b1\n\n13\n\n\u03b2\n\nProposition 1.2.4. Let G \u2212\u2192 F \u2212\u2192 E be a complex of presheaves on a Grothendieck\ntopology T . Then the following holds.\n(i) If the complex is exact as a complex of presheaves, then it is T -exact.\n(ii) If the sheafified complex is U -exact, then the complex of presheaves is U -exact.\n(iii) The complex is T -exact if and only if the associated complex of sheaves is T -exact.\n(iv) A complex of sheaves is exact if and only if it is T -exact.\nProof. (i) is clear. (ii). Suppose that the sheafified complex is U -exact, and let s \u2208 \u0393(U, F)\nmapping to 0. Then there exists a covering Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U , i \u2208 I, and elements ti \u2208 \u0393(Ui , G # )\n#\nmapping to si = \u03c1U\nUi (\u03b8(s)) \u2208 \u0393(Ui , F ). The elements ti are represented by sections of G\nin a finer covering and also the identities hold already in F in a finer covering.\n(iii). One direction follows from (ii). For the other direction let s \u2208 \u0393(U, F # ) mapping to\n0 in \u0393(U, E # ). Then there exists a covering Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U , i \u2208 I, and si \u2208 \u0393(Ui , F) representing\ns and coverings Vj \u2212\n\u2192 Ui , j \u2208 J i , such that the restrictions of \u03b2(si ) in \u0393(Vj , E) are 0. Since\nthe statement is local we may assume that Ui = Vj = U . But then again the assumptions\non the presheaves yield immediately a covering Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U and sections ti \u2208 \u0393(Ui , G) \u2212\n\u2192\n\u0393(Ui , G # ) which map to the restrictions of s. (iv) follows from the definitions.\n\u0003\n1.3. Site morphisms.\nWe will call a category T with a final object X, with arbitrary products and endowed\nwith a Grothendieck topology a site, and we will denote it by (X, TX ) or sometimes just\nby X. Later on X will be a scheme, the products will be products of schemes and TX will\nbe a subcategory of schemes over X.\nIf TX and TY are two sites with final objects X and Y , then a site morphism \u03c6\u2217 : TX \u2212\n\u2192\nTY , for which we will briefly write \u03c6 : Y \u2212\n\u2192 X, is a functor TX \u2212\n\u2192 TY with \u03c6\u2217 (X) = Y\nand which respects products and coverings, so that if Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U , i \u2208 I, is a covering in TX ,\nthen \u03c6\u2217 (Ui ) \u2212\n\u2192 \u03c6\u2217 (U ), i \u2208 I, is a covering in TY .\nConstruction 1.3.1. A site morphism \u03c6 : Y \u2212\n\u2192 X associates to a presheaf P of abelian\ngroups on X a presheaf \u03c6\u22121 (P) on Y (called its inverse image) in the following way (cf. the\nconstruction of u! in [24, Proposition I.5.1] in connection with [24, Proposition III.1.6]). For\nV \u2208 TY , let IV\u03c6 be the category of all pairs (U, \u03c1) with U \u2208 TX and \u03c1 \u2208 MorTY (V, \u03c6\u2217 (U )).\nThe morphisms MorI \u03c6 ((U1 , \u03c11 ), (U2 , \u03c12 )) in this category are the maps \u03c3 \u2208 MorTX (U1 , U2 )\nV\nsuch that \u03c6\u2217 (\u03c3) \u25e6 \u03c11 = \u03c12 . This category is quasicofiltered, since for \u03c11 : V \u2212\n\u2192 \u03c6\u2217 (U1 )\n\u2217\n\u2217\nand \u03c12 : V \u2212\n\u2192 \u03c6 (U2 ) mapping to \u03c10 : V \u2212\n\u2192 \u03c6 (U0 ) via \u03c31 : U1 \u2212\n\u2192 U0 and \u03c32 : U2 \u2212\n\u2192 U0\nthere exists \u03c1 : V \u2212\n\u2192 \u03c6\u2217 (U1 ) \u00d7\u03c6\u2217 (U0 ) \u03c6\u2217 (U2 ) = \u03c6\u2217 (U1 \u00d7U0 U2 ) over \u03c11 and \u03c12 . We take the\ncolimit\n\u03c6\u22121 (P)(V ) := lim \u0393(U, P) .\n\u2212\u2192 \u03c6\n(U,\u03c1)\u2208IV\n\nin the category of abelian groups. This indeed defines a presheaf on TY , since a map\n\u03c6\n\u03c4 \u2208 MorTY (V, W ) induces a functor IW\n\u2212\n\u2192 IV\u03c6 by sending (U, \u03c1) to (U, \u03c1 \u25e6 \u03c4 ) and thus\ninduces a map of the colimits above.\nThe categories IV\u03c6 are in general not cofiltered, but they are under the following cofiltered\ncondition. For every pair \u03c81 , \u03c82 : U \u21d2 U \u2032 in TX and \u03c1 : V \u2212\n\u2192 \u03c6\u2217 (U ) in TY there exists\n\u03b3 : \u0168 \u2212\n\u2192 U which unifies \u03c81 and \u03c82 and \u03c1\u0303 : V \u2212\n\u2192 \u03c6\u2217 (\u0168 ) such that \u03c6\u2217 (\u03b3) \u25e6 \u03c1\u0303 = \u03c1. Under\n\u22121\nthis condition \u03c6 (P) has the easy set-theoretical description.\n\n\f14\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nThe presheaf \u03c6\u22121 (P) constructed in 1.3.1 can be sheafified, but for us it will be more\nimportant to sheafify with respect to a structure sheaf of rings on the sites (we need the\n'image r\u00e9ciproque au sens modules' instead of the 'image r\u00e9ciproque ensembliste', cf. [24,\nExpos\u00e9s IV.11-13]).\nDefinition 1.3.2. A site T is called a (pre-)ringed site if there exists a fixed (pre)sheaf\nU 7\u2192 \u0393(U, O), U \u2208 T , of commutative rings, called its structure (pre)sheaf.\nA presheaf P of abelian groups on such a (pre-)ringed site is called an O-premodule, if\nit has additionally an O-multiplication such that \u0393(U, P) is an \u0393(U, O)-module for every\nU \u2208 T . If moreover P is a sheaf, then we call it an O-module.\nThe sheafification of the structure presheaf O on a preringed site makes it into a ringed\nsite. The sheafification of an O-premodule F is an O-module and an O# -module, since\nthe multiplication O \u00d7 F \u2212\n\u2192 F sheafifies to O# \u00d7 F # \u2212\n\u2192 F #.\nDefinition 1.3.3. If (TX , OX ) and (TY , OY ) are two (pre)-ringed sites, then a site morphism \u03c6\u2217 : TX \u2212\n\u2192 TY , for which we will write again \u03c6 : Y \u2212\n\u2192 X, is called a morphism of (pre)ringed sites, if there is given a family of ring homomorphisms \u0393(U, OX ) \u2212\n\u2192\n\u0393(\u03c6\u2217 (U ), OY ) compatible with the restrictions in the topologies.\nRemark 1.3.4.

On the\nother hand, if such a presheaf morphism is given, then the composition \u0393(U, OX ) \u2212\n\u2192\n\u0393(\u03c6\u2217 (U ), \u03c6\u22121 (OX )) \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(\u03c6\u2217 (U ), OY ) yields the ring homomorphisms between the sites.\nIn the case of a morphism between (pre-)ringed sites \u03c6 : Y \u2212\n\u2192 X the inverse image\n\u03c6\u22121 (F) of an OX -(pre)module F is in general not an OY -(pre)module.\nDefinition 1.3.5.

Extension and contraction under a site morphism.\nA ring homomorphism \u03c6 : R \u2212\n\u2192 S defines for an ideal I \u2286 R the extended ideal IS in\nS and then the contraction \u03c6\u22121 (IS), which contains I. Basically the same construction\napplies to an arbitrary site morphism. Later on we will specialize to the situation where\nthe site morphism (Spec R)top \u2212\n\u2192 Spec R is given by a Grothendieck topology on an affine\nscheme Spec R. This gives then a closure operation for ideals in R.\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n15\n\nDefinition 1.4.1.

In particular, for an\nideal sheaf I \u2286 OX we call the image sheaf of \u03c6\u2217 (I) inside OY = \u03c6\u2217 (OX ) the extended\nideal sheaf, denoted by I ext .\nRecall that a site morphism \u03c6 : Y \u2212\n\u2192 X defines a functor H 7\u2192 \u03c6\u2217 (H) for presheaves by\nsetting \u0393(U, \u03c6\u2217 (H)) := \u0393(\u03c6\u2217 (U ), H) for U \u2208 TX . This push forward functor sends sheaves\nto sheaves and is left exact. It also sends OY -modules to OX -modules. In particular, for\nan OY -submodule H \u2286 H\u2032 also \u03c6\u2217 (H) \u2286 \u03c6\u2217 (H\u2032 ) is an OX -submodule. For an OX -module\nF we have a natural sheaf homomorphism \u03b8 : F \u2212\n\u2192 \u03c6\u2217 (\u03c6\u2217 (F)) given by\n\u03b8 : \u0393(U, F) \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(U, \u03c6\u2217 (\u03c6\u2217 (F))) = \u0393(\u03c6\u2217 (U ), \u03c6\u2217 (F)) .\n\nDefinition 1.4.2. Let \u03c6 : Y \u2212\n\u2192 X be a site morphism between two ringed sites, let\nF be an OX -module. An OY -submodule H \u2286 \u03c6\u2217 (F) yields an OX -submodule \u03c6\u2217 (H) \u2286\n\u03c6\u2217 (\u03c6\u2217 (F)). We call the OX -submodule of F given as the preimage sheaf of \u03c6\u2217 (H) under the natural sheaf homomorphism \u03b8 : F \u2212\n\u2192 \u03c6\u2217 (\u03c6\u2217 (F)) the contracted module, decont\ncont\nnoted by H . Explicitly, we have \u0393(U, H\n) = {s \u2208 \u0393(U, F) : \u03b8(s) \u2208 \u0393(U, \u03c6\u2217 (H)) =\n\u0393(\u03c6\u2217 (U ), H)}.\nDefinition 1.4.3. Let \u03c6 : Y \u2212\n\u2192 X be a site morphism between two ringed sites, let\nG \u2286 F be OX -modules. We call the contraction of the extension the closure submodule of\nG inside F via \u03c6, and denote it by G \u03c6\u2212c = G c = (G ext )cont .\nProposition 1.4.4. Let \u03c6 : Y \u2212\u2192 X be a site morphism between two ringed sites, let\nG \u2286 F be OX -modules. Then the following holds.\n(i) The closure submodule G c is an OX -module and in particular a sheaf.\n(ii) We have G \u2286 G c = (G c )c .\n(iii) Let G \u2032 \u2286 F \u2032 be another pair of OX -modules and let \u03bc : F \u2212\u2192 F \u2032 be an OX -module\nhomomorphism with \u03bc(G) \u2286 G \u2032 . Then \u03bc(G c ) \u2286 (G \u2032 )c .\n(iv) If G \u2286 H \u2286 F is another OX -submodule, then G c \u2286 Hc .\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n\n(v) Consider the short exact sequence 0 \u2212\u2192 G \u2212\u2192 F \u2212\u2192 E \u2212\u2192 0 of OX -modules, where\nE = F/G. Then G c = \u03b2 \u22121 (0c ).\nProof. (i) is clear from the corresponding properties of extension and contraction.\n(ii). The inclusion G \u2286 G c and so also G c \u2286 (G c )c is clear. For the other direction note\nthat in general (Hcont )ext \u2286 H for a submodule H \u2286 \u03c6\u2217 (F). This is because \u03c6\u2217 (Hcont ) \u2212\n\u2192\n\u03c6\u2217 (F) factors through H, since we have Hcont \u2212\n\u2192 \u03c6\u2217 (H) by definition and so \u03c6\u2217 (Hcont ) \u2212\n\u2192\n\u03c6\u2217 \u03c6\u2217 (H), and by adjunction we get \u03c6\u2217 \u03c6\u2217 (H) \u2212\n\u2192H\u2212\n\u2192 \u03c6\u2217 (F).\n\u2217\n(iii) follows from applying \u03c6 to the commutative diagram\nG\n\n/F\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n\n\u03bc\n\nG\u2032\n(iv) is a special case of (iii).\n\n/ F\u2032 .\n\n\f16\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\n(v). The inclusion \u2286 follows from (iii). For the other inclusion note that we have by\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n\nLemma 1.3.6 an exact sequence of sheaves \u03c6\u2217 (G) \u2212\n\u2192 \u03c6\u2217 (F) \u2212\n\u2192 \u03c6\u2217 (E) \u2212\n\u2192 0 in TY , where\next\nc\nG\n= im(\u03b1) = kern(\u03b2) holds. If s \u2208 \u0393(U, F) is such that \u03b2(s) \u2208 0 (inside E = F/G),\nthen \u03b8(\u03b2(s)) = 0 in \u0393(\u03c6\u2217 (U ), \u03c6\u2217 (E)), since 0ext = 0. But then \u03b8(s) \u2208 \u0393(\u03c6\u2217 (U ), \u03c6\u2217 (F))\nmaps to 0 in \u0393(\u03c6\u2217 (U ), \u03c6\u2217 (E)) and belongs to \u0393(\u03c6\u2217 (U ), G ext ).\n\u0003\nWe describe the containment in the closure submodule more explicitly.\nLemma 1.4.5. Let \u03c6 : Y \u2212\u2192 X be a morphism between two (pre-)ringed sites and suppose\nthat it fulfills the cofiltered condition of 1.3.1. Let G \u2286 F be OX -(pre-) modules. Let\ns \u2208 \u0393(U, F), U \u2208 TX . Set V = \u03c6\u2217 (U ). Then s \u2208 \u0393(U, G c ) if and only if there exists\n\u03c4i\n\na covering Vi \u2212\u2192 V , i \u2208 I, and morphisms \u03c1i : Vi \u2212\u2192 \u03c6\u2217 (Ui ) in TY and \u03c3i : Ui \u2212\u2192 U\nin TX such that \u03c4i = \u03c6\u2217 (\u03c3i ) \u25e6 \u03c1i and sections ti \u2208 \u0393(Ui , G) \u2297\u0393(Ui ,OX ) \u0393(Vi , OY ) such\nthat \u03c1U\nUi (s) \u2297 1 = \u03b1(ti ) in \u0393(Ui , F) \u2297\u0393(Ui ,OX ) \u0393(Vi , OY ), where \u03b1 denotes the inclusion\n\u03b1 : G \u2212\u2192 F.\nProof. The element s \u2208 \u0393(U, F) defines the element \u03b8(s) \u2208 \u0393(V, \u03c6\u2217 (F)) as the image of\ns \u2297 1 under\n\u0393(U, F) \u2297\u0393(U,OX ) \u0393(V, OY ) \u2212\u2192 \u0393(V, \u03c6\u22121 (F)) \u2297\u0393(V,\u03c6\u22121 (OX )) \u0393(V, OY ) \u2212\u2192 \u0393(V, \u03c6\u2217 (F)) .\n\nThis element is in the image sheaf of \u03c6\u2217 (G) \u2212\n\u2192 \u03c6\u2217 (F) if and only if there exists a covering Vi \u2212\n\u2192 V , i \u2208 I, and sections ri \u2208 \u0393(Vi , \u03c6\u2217 (G)) mapping to \u03c1VVi (\u03b8(s)). Each ri\nis represented by a covering Wj \u2212\n\u2192 Vi , j \u2208 Ji , and elements r\u0303j \u2208 \u0393(Wj , \u03c6pre (G)) =\n\u22121\n\u0393(Wj , \u03c6 (G)) \u2297\u0393(Wj ,\u03c6\u22121 (OX )) \u0393(Wj , OY ) (fulfilling some compatible condition, which we\ndo not need). We denote the composed covering of V again by Vi . By the definition of\ninverse presheaf, the sections ri \u2208 \u0393(Vi , \u03c6\u22121 (G)) \u2297\u0393(Vi ,\u03c6\u22121 (OX )) \u0393(Vi , OY ) are represented\nby ti \u2208 \u0393(Ui , G) \u2297\u0393(Ui ,OX ) \u0393(Vi , OY ), where \u03c1i : Vi \u2212\n\u2192 \u03c6\u2217 (Ui ) are morphisms in TY and\nUi \u2208 TX . These elements define sections \u03b1(ti ) \u2208 \u0393(Ui , F) \u2297\u0393(Ui ,OX ) \u0393(Vi , OY ), which map\nby assumption to \u03c1VVi (\u03b8(s)) \u2208 \u0393(Vi , \u03c6\u2217 (F)).\nWe may replace Ui by Ui \u00d7X U (denoted again by Ui ) so that we have the projections to\nU , the morphisms commute in the described way and si = \u03c1U\nUi (s) \u2208 \u0393(Ui , F) makes sense.\nSo we have elements \u03b1(ti ) and si \u2297 1 in \u0393(Ui , F) \u2297\u0393(Ui ,OX ) \u0393(Vi , OY ) and we know that\nthey define the same element in the sheafification \u0393(Vi , \u03c6\u2217 (F)). This means that there\nexist coverings Wj \u2212\n\u2192 Vi , j \u2208 Ji , such that their difference is 0 in \u0393(Wj , \u03c6pre (F)). This\nmeans by the cofiltered condition that there exist morphisms Wj \u2212\n\u2192 \u03c6\u2217 (Xj ), Xj \u2208 TX ,\nsuch that the restriction of si \u2297 1 in \u0393(Ui \u00d7X Xj , F) \u2297\u0393(Ui \u00d7X Xj ,OX ) \u0393(Wj , OY ) equals the\nS\nrestriction of \u03b1(ti ). So the covering Wj \u2212\n\u2192 V , j \u2208 i Ji , has all the desired properties. \u0003\nExample 1.4.6. Let X denote an algebraic variety over the complex numbers C and let\nX(C) denote the corresponding complex space with the sheaf of holomorphic functions.\nThen we have a morphism of ringed spaces X(C) \u2212\n\u2192 X, which is in particular a site\nmorphism. Extension and contraction yields the same ideal back, since the algebraic stalks\nand the analytic stalks at a closed point have the same completion, which is faithfully flat.\nSo if f \u2208 I an , then this holds in every analytic stalk, in their completions and therefore\nalready in the algebraic setting.\nIf we consider however X(C) with the sheaf of continuous functions, denoted by Xcont ,\nthen extension and contraction may give back a larger ideal I cont , which we call the continuous closure. For example, in C[z, w] we have z 2 w2 6\u2208 (z 3 , w3 ), but z 2 w2 \u2208 (z 3 , w3 )cont .\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n17\n\nWe deal with this continuous closure in [7], where we give a precise description of it for\nmonomial ideals.\n1.5. Grothendieck topologies on a scheme.\nLet X denote a scheme, and let SchX denote the category of schemes over X, where the\nmorphisms are supposed to be compatible with the structure morphisms. A Grothendieck\ntopology on a subcategory TX \u2286 SchX containing X and closed under products is called\na Grothendieck topology on X. We will denote the scheme X endowed with such a\ntopology by Xtop , where top is a name for the corresponding topology. Note that the\nproducts appearing in Definition 1.1.1 are now products of schemes. The site (Xtop , TX )\nis immediately a preringed site (Xtop , TX , Opre ) by setting \u0393(U, Opre ) := \u0393(U, OU ) for\nU \u2208 TX , and sheafification in the topology gives a ringed site (Xtop , TX , Otop ).\nA site morphism between schemes Ytop and Xtop is a scheme morphism \u03c6 : Y \u2212\n\u2192 X such\nthat U \u2208 TX implies that \u03c6\u2217 (U ) = Y \u00d7X U \u2208 TY and such that a covering Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U , i \u2208 I,\nyields a covering Y \u00d7X Ui \u2212\n\u2192 Y \u00d7X U , i \u2208 I. It is then also a morphism of (pre)ringed\nsites by taking \u0393(U, Opre ) = \u0393(U, OU ) \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(\u03c6\u2217 (U ), O\u03c6\u2217 (U ) ) = \u0393(\u03c6\u2217 (U ), Opre ) and its\nsheafification. A scheme morphism may or may not induce a site morphism. For our\ntreatment we will also adopt the following convention.\nConvention 1.5.1. In saying that a scheme X has a Grothendieck topology TX we mean\nthat there exists a basic (or standard) topology BX on X which is always inside the Zariski\ntopology (it will be usually either the trivial topology (Example 1.5.2) or the Zariski\ntopology) and which we will not mention in general, of which the given Grothendieck\ntopology is a refinement. In particular we have a site morphism \u03c6 : Xtop \u2212\n\u2192 X. We\nassume also that if j : V \u2212\n\u2192 X belongs to TX and factors through an open subscheme\nV \u2212\n\u2192 U \u2286 X, then also V \u2212\n\u2192 U \u2208 TX . We denote the Otop -sheafification of an OX -module\nM by Mtop = \u03c6\u2217 (M ).\nExample 1.5.2. Let R be a commutative ring and consider the category consisting of one\nobject X ('Spec R') and one identical morphism. We define a sheaf of rings by \u0393(X, OX ) =\nR and call this the trivial site for R. An R-module M yields immediately an OX -module,\nwhich we also denote by M .\nLet TR be a subcategory of R-algebras (or rather its opposite category, so we will\nwrite Spec S instead of S) containing R, closed under tensor products and endowed\nwith a certain Grothendieck topology. Then TR is immediately a preringed site by setting \u0393(Spec S, Opre ) = S, and we get a morphism of preringed sites by the inclusion\n\u03c6\u2217 : {X} \u2212\n\u2192 TR (with \u03c6\u2217 (X) = X). The ring homomorphism is given by the identity\n\u0393(X, OX ) = R \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(\u03c6\u2217 (X), Opre ) = R. The inverse image presheaf of an OX -module M\nis given by the constant presheaf since\n\u0393(Spec S, \u03c6\u22121 (M )) =\n\nlim\n\u2212\u2192\n\n(U,\u03c1)\u2208IS\u03c6\n\n\u0393(U, M ) =\n\nlim \u0393(X, M ) = M .\n\u2212\u2192\n\n\u03c1:R\u2212\n\u2192S\n\nHere the (only) indexing morphism R \u2212\n\u2192 S is the structure homomorphism of the Ralgebra S. The OX -module M yields the corresponding Opre -premodule \u03c6pre (M ) by\nsending Spec S 7\u2192 M \u2297R S. The sheafification Mtop (and also Otop ) might be difficult to\ncompute, depending on the topology.\nExample 1.5.3. Let X = Spec R be an affine scheme with the trivial topology and let\nXZar be the affine scheme with the Zariski topology and with the structure sheaf OZar ,\n\n\f18\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nso that \u03c6 : XZar \u2212\n\u2192 Xtriv is a morphism of ringed sites. If M is an R-module, then the\ninverse image presheaf \u03c6\u22121 (M ) is the constant presheaf V 7\u2192 M . The associated OZar premodule is given by V 7\u2192 M \u2297R \u0393(V, OZar ). The pull-back of M is the sheaf associated\nto this presheaf and gives the quasicoherent module M\u0303 [27, Proposition II.5.1].\nDefinition 1.5.4. Let TX denote a Grothendieck topology on a scheme X.\nWe call TX or Xtop affine, if all structural morphisms U \u2212\n\u2192 X in TX are affine (then\nall morphisms are affine).\nWe call it of finite type if all morphisms U \u2212\n\u2192 V in TX are of finite type.\nWe call it quasicompact if for every covering Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U , i \u2208 I, there exists a finite subset\nJ \u2286 I such that Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U , i \u2208 J, is also a covering.\nWe call it single-handed if it is of finite type and if every covering is given by a single\nmorphism U \u2212\n\u2192V.\nWe call it covering if every morphism in TX is a cover.\nProposition 1.5.5. Let X be a scheme and let TX be a Grothendieck topology on X\n(recall Convention 1.5.1). Let \u03c6 : Xtop \u2212\u2192 X be the corresponding site morphism. Let\nj : V \u2212\u2192 X be in TX , considered as a Zariski morphism, and let M be an OX -module.\nThen the following hold.\n(i) We have \u0393(V, \u03c6\u22121 (M )) = \u0393(V, j \u22121 (M )).\n(ii) We have \u0393(V, \u03c6pre (M )) = \u0393(V, j pre (M )).\n(iii) The sheafification \u03c6\u2217 (M ) = Mtop equals the TX -sheafification of the Opre -premodule\nV 7\u2192 \u0393(V, j pre (M )).\n(iv) If TX is a refinement of the Zariski topology or an affine topology on an affine\nscheme, then Mtop equals also the sheafification of V 7\u2192 \u0393(V, j \u2217 (M )), where j \u2217 is\nthe pull-back of modules in the Zariski topology.\nProof. (i). We have\n\u0393(V, \u03c6\u22121 (M )) =\n\nlim\n\u2212\u2192\n\n(U,\u03c1)\u2208IV\u03c6\n\n\u0393(U, M ) = lim \u0393(U, M ) = \u0393(V, j \u22121 (M )) ,\n\u2212\u2192\nj(V )\u2286U\n\nbecause there exists by our convention a morphism V \u2212\n\u2192 U = \u03c6\u2217 (U ) in TX if and only if\nj(V ) \u2286 U .\n(ii). We have by Definition 1.3.5 and part (i)\n\u0393(V, \u03c6pre (M )) = \u0393(V, \u03c6\u22121 (M )) \u2297\u0393(V,\u03c6\u22121 (OZar )) \u0393(V, Opre )\n= \u0393(V, j \u22121 (M )) \u2297\u0393(V,j \u22121 (OZar )) \u0393(V, OV ) = \u0393(V, j pre (M )) .\n\n(iii) follows from (ii). (iv) follows also from (ii), since in the first case V 7\u2192 \u0393(V, j \u2217 (M ))\nis the Zariski sheafification of the presheaf V 7\u2192 \u0393(V, \u03c6\u22121 (M )) = \u0393(V, j \u22121 (M )), and\nthe topology is a refinement of the Zariski topology. In the second case \u0393(V, j \u2217 (M )) =\n\u0393(V, j pre (M )) anyway.\n\u0003\nCorollary 1.5.6. Let X denote a scheme endowed with a Grothendieck topology TX ,\nand suppose that it is either a refinement of the Zariski topology or affine over an affine\nscheme. Let j : Y \u2212\u2192 X be in TX and let M be an OX -module on X. Let Mtop be its\nsheafification in Xtop and let j \u2217 (M ) be the Zariski pull-back to Y . Let TY be the category\nconsisting of all morphisms Z \u2212\u2192 Y in TX as objects and the morphisms in TX over Y\nas morphisms (and the induced coverings). Then the restriction sheaf (Mtop )|TY given by\n(Z \u2212\u2192 Y ) 7\u2192 \u0393(Z, Mtop ) equals the sheafification (j \u2217 (M ))top in TY .\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n19\n\nProof. We have to show for \u03c1 : Z \u2212\n\u2192 Y (in TY ) that \u0393(Z, (j \u2217 (M ))top ) = \u0393(Z, Mtop ). By\nProposition 1.5.5(iv) both sheaves come from the presheaf (\u03c1 : Z \u2212\n\u2192 Y ) 7\u2192 \u03c1\u2217 (j \u2217 (M )), one\ntime sheafified in TX and one time sheafified in TY . The objects Z \u2212\n\u2192 Y have the same\ncoverings in TX and in TY , because a covering Zi \u2212\n\u2192 Z over X can also be considered as\na covering with basis Y via Z \u2212\n\u2192 Y . Hence the associated separated presheaves are the\nsame and then also their sheafifications.\n\u0003\nExample 1.5.7. Proposition 1.5.5 and Corollary 1.5.6 are not true without Convention\n1.5.1 on Zariski factorizations. To give an example, let R be a normal domain of dimension\n\u2265 2. Let X = Spec R have the trivial topology and let TX be given by the Zariski\nopen subsets which contain all points of codimension one (and Zariski coverings). Then\n\u0393(V, OX ) = R for all V \u2208 TX , and Xtop is a ringed site with constant structure sheaf.\nFor an R-module M the inverse image presheaf under \u03c6 : Xtop \u2212\n\u2192 X is constant, and\nso also \u03c6pre (M ) is constant = M . Let now Y \u2208 TX and M be an R-module such that\n\u0393(Y, M\u0303 ) 6= M , e.g. take j : Y = X \u2212 {P } \u2212\n\u2192 X and M = \u03ba(P ), where P \u2208 X is a closed\n\u2217\n\u2217\npoint. Then j (M ) = 0 and so (j (M ))top = 0, but \u0393(Y, Mtop ) = M .\nTo a large extent we will restrict to affine, single-handed Grothendieck topologies on an\naffine scheme X = Spec R, so that TR = TX is given by a category of R-algebras and the\ncoverings are given by a certain class of R-algebra homomorphisms.\nRemark 1.5.8. We will often consider the Zariski topology on a scheme X as an (affine)\nsingle-handed Grothendieck topology, called the (affine) single-handed Zariski topology,\nwhere TX consists of all finite disjoint Uunions of (affine) open immersions U \u2212\n\u2192 X and\nwhereU the only coverings are given by Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U \u2032 , where the Ui do cover U \u2032 as a set. If\n\u2192 X is a Zariski covering and F is a quasicoherent sheaf on X, then\nY = i\u2208I Ui \u2212\n\u0393(Y \u00d7X Y, F) = \u0393((\n= \u0393(\n=\n\n]\n\nUi ) \u00d7 X (\n\ni\u2208I\n\ni\u2208I]\n\n(i,j)\u2208I\u00d7I\nM\n(i,j)\u2208I\u00d7I\n\n]\n\nUi ), F)\n\nUi \u00d7X Uj , F)\n\n\u0393(Ui \u00d7X Uj , F) =\n\nM\n(i,j)\u2208I\u00d7I\n\n\u0393(Ui \u2229 Uj , F) .\n\nThis holds more generally for every sheaf which respects disjoint Zariski unions (as in\nLemma 1.5.10) and it holds also for products with more than two factors. From this it\nfollows that the \u010cech cohomology for such sheaves is the same in the Zariski site and in\nthe single-handed Zariski site.\nAlthough we will mainly deal with single-handed Grothendieck topologies it is good to\nknow when they respect Zariski covers.\nDefinition 1.5.9. Let X be a scheme with a Grothendieck topology TX . We say that\nthe Grothendieck topology respects (disjoint) Zariski coverings if a family of morphisms\nUi \u2212\n\u2192 U , iS\u2208 I, (inside TU\nX ) is a covering if and only if for an arbitrary (disjoint) Zariski\n\u2192 Vj , i \u2208 I, is a covering of Vj for\ncover U = j\u2208J Vj (U = j\u2208J Vj ) the family Ui \u00d7V Vj \u2212\nevery j.\nU\n\nLemma 1.5.10. Let X = i\u2208I Ui be a finite disjoint union of open subschemes of a scheme\nX. Let an affine single-handed Grothendieck topology Xtop be given which is a refinement\nof the single-handed Zariski topology and which respects disjoint Zariski coverings. Let M\n\n\f20\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nbe an OX -module on X. Then \u0393(Xtop , Mtop ) =\n(\u03c6i : Ui \u2212\u2192 X).\n\nL\n\ni\u2208I\n\n\u0393(Ui , Mtop ) =\n\nL\n\ni\u2208I\n\n\u0393(Ui , (\u03c6\u2217i M )top )\n\nProof. The second equation follows from Corollary 1.5.6. The morphisms \u03c6i : Ui \u2212\n\u2192X\ninduce the restrictions \u0393(Xtop , Mtop ) \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(Ui , Mtop ). An element s \u2208 \u0393(Xtop , Mtop ) is\nrepresented by t \u2208 \u0393(Y, \u03c8 \u2217 (M )) (Proposition 1.5.5(iv)), where \u03c8 : Y \u2212\n\u2192 X is a cover in\nthe topology. Suppose that s restricts to 0 in \u0393(Ui , Mtop ) for all open subsets Ui . This\nmeans that \u03b8(t) \u2208 \u0393(Y, Mtop ) restricts to 0 in \u0393(Ui \u00d7X Y, Mtop ) and so there exist covers\nZ \u2212\n\u2192 Ui \u00d7X Y such that the pull-backs of t are 0. These covers glue together to the cover\nUi\n\u2192 Y (since being a cover can be tested on the disjoint subsets of the union),\ni\u2208I Zi \u2212\nhence also \u03b8(t) = 0 in \u0393(Y, Mtop ) and so s = 0 in \u0393(X, Mtop ). On the other hand, let\nsi \u2208 \u0393(Ui , Mtop ) be given. Say si is represented by compatible elements ti \u2208 \u0393(Zi , \u03c8i\u2217 (M )),\nwhere \u03c8i : Zi \u2212\n\u2192 Ui is a cover for each i \u2208 I. Then again these covers glue together to a\ncover of X, and the tuple (ti ) is also compatible over X, so it defines a global section. \u0003\n1.6. Rings and modules of global sections.\nIn the flat (or the \u00e9tale) Grothendieck topology on an affine scheme Spec R we have\n\u0393(Spec R, Otop ) = R. This does not hold for non-pure topologies in general. We have to\ncompute in a given Grothendieck topology TX the sheafification U 7\u2192 \u0393(U, Otop ), U \u2208 TX ,\nassociated to the presheaf U 7\u2192 \u0393(U, OU ), and this computation is a non-trivial matter.\nProposition 1.6.1. Suppose that we have a Grothendieck topology on a certain subcategory G of schemes, meaning that for every X \u2208 G we have a Grothendieck topology\nTX and every scheme morphism Y \u2212\u2192 X in G induces a site morphism Ytop \u2212\u2192 Xtop .\nThen we get a functor X 7\u2192 \u0393(X, Otop ), X \u2208 G, together with a natural transformation\n\u03b8 : \u0393(X, OX ) \u2212\u2192 \u0393(X, Otop ).\nProof. This is clear.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 1.6.2. In this way we will encounter the perfect closure (Theorem 4.3.3), the\nsemi-normalization (Proposition 5.2.3), the ring of constructible sections (Theorem 3.8.2),\nthe completion of a local ring (Proposition 7.1.1) and more. In particular, we have\n\u0393((Spec R)top , Otop ) 6= R. From this it follows that the additive group scheme A1 does\nnot define a sheaf in the topology, because Mor(X, A1 ) \u223c\n= \u0393(X, OX ) 6= \u0393(Xtop , Otop ) [27,\nExercise 2.4]. Hence such topologies are not subcanonical, i.e. not every representable\nfunctor is a sheaf (see [66, Definition 2.54] or [24, D\u00e9finition II.2.5]).\nA global section f \u2208 \u0393(X, Otop ) is represented by a compatible family fi \u2208 \u0393(Ui , OUi ),\ni \u2208 I, where Ui \u2212\n\u2192 X, i \u2208 I, is a covering in the Grothendieck topology, and where the\ncompatibility condition means that p\u22171 (fi ) \u2212 p\u22172 (fj ) \u2208 \u0393(Ui \u00d7X Uj ) has the property that\nit vanishes on a covering of Ui \u00d7X Uj . A similar characterization holds for an OX -module\nM . Quite often we will deal with a single cover Y \u2212\n\u2192 X, and a global section is then given\nby f \u2208 \u0393(Y, OY ) such that p\u22171 (f ) \u2212 p\u22172 (f ) \u2208 \u0393(Y \u00d7X Y, O) is zero in a covering of Y \u00d7X Y .\nLemma 1.6.3. Suppose that a Grothendieck topology on a scheme X has the property\nthat every covering \u03c6i : Ui \u2212\u2192 X, i \u2208 I, has a section \u03c8i : X \u2212\u2192 Ui for some i (M. Walker\ncalls such X acyclic; cf. [69, Lemma 3.7]). Then for an OX -module M the natural\nhomomorphism \u03b8 : \u0393(X, M ) \u2212\u2192 \u0393(X, Mtop ) is an isomorphism.\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n21\n\nProof. Let s \u2208 \u0393(X, M ). If s = 0 in \u0393(X, Mtop ), then there exists a covering \u03c6i : Ui \u2212\n\u2192 X,\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2192 Ui \u2212\n\u2192X\ni \u2208 I, such that \u03c6i (s) = 0 in \u0393(Ui , \u03c6i (M )) for all i \u2208 I. The factorization X \u2212\nshows that s = 0.\nOn the other hand, let s \u2208 \u0393(X, M ) be represented by si \u2208 \u0393(Ui , \u03c6\u2217i (M )) for a covering\nUi \u2212\n\u2192 X, i \u2208 I. Then via X \u2212\n\u2192 Ui \u2212\n\u2192 X the element si gives an element \u03c8i\u2217 (si ) \u2208\n\u0003\n\u0393(X, M ), and since id : X \u2212\n\u2192 X is a covering, we may represent s also by \u03c8i\u2217 (si ).\nLemma 1.6.4. Let Y \u2212\u2192 X be a cover in a Grothendieck topology on X, and let f \u2208\n\u0393(Y, OY ) be a compatible element, defining a global element in \u0393(X, Otop ). If \u03b1 : Y \u2212\u2192 Y is\nan X-automorphism, then \u03b1\u2217 (f ) is also compatible and it defines the same global element.\nProof. It is clear that \u03b1\u2217 (f ) is also compatible, since an automorphism preserves the\ncompatibility conditions. Suppose that the pull-backs of p\u22171 (f ) and p\u22172 (f ) are the same\nunder the covering Zi \u2212\n\u2192 Y \u00d7X Y , i \u2208 I. The automorphism id \u00d7\u03b1 : Y \u00d7X Y \u2212\n\u2192 Y \u00d7X Y\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nshows that also (id \u00d7\u03b1) (p1 (f )) = p1 (f ) and (id \u00d7\u03b1) (p2 (f )) = p2 (\u03b1 (f )) are the same\nin some covering. Therefore also p\u22172 (f ) and p\u22172 (\u03b1\u2217 (f )) are the same in some covering.\nHence f and \u03b1\u2217 (f ) are the same in some covering and so they define the same element in\n\u0393(X, Otop ).\n\u0003\nIf a Grothendieck topology TX on X = Spec R has the property that the reduction\ndefines a cover, then it is important to know for an element f \u2208 S, R \u2212\n\u2192 S a cover,\nwhether f \u2297 1 \u2212 1 \u2297 f \u2208 S\u2297R S is nilpotent. In this case f is compatible and defines a\nglobal element in \u0393(Rtop , Otop ).\nLemma 1.6.5. Let S denote an R-algebra, f \u2208 S. Then f \u22971\u22121\u2297f \u2208 S\u2297R S is nilpotent\nif and only if the following hold: For all homomorphisms \u03c6 : R \u2212\u2192 K, K a field, and any\ntwo extensions \u03c81 , \u03c82 : S \u2212\u2192 K of \u03c6, we have \u03c81 (f ) = \u03c82 (f ).\nProof. The element \u03b4(f ) = f \u2297 1 \u2212 1 \u2297 f \u2208 S\u2297R S is nilpotent if and only if for all ring\nhomomorphisms S\u2297R S \u2212\n\u2192 K, K a field, the image of \u03b4(f ) is 0. These homomorphisms\nare in one to one correspondence with the data described in the lemma, so the result\nfollows.\n\u0003\nLemma 1.6.6. Let a Grothendieck topology be given on a subcategory G of schemes such\nthat every morphism in G induces a site morphism. Suppose that for X \u2208 G all U \u2212\u2192 X\n(in TX ) and all morphisms Spec \u03ba(x) = x \u2212\u2192 X, x \u2208 X a point, belong to G. Suppose\nalso that \u0393(x, Otop ) = \u03ba(x) (or \u03ba(x)\u221e ) for every point x in G. Then a compatible element\nf \u2208 \u0393(Y, OY ), Y \u2212\u2192 X a cover, has the property that for two points y1 , y2 \u2208 Y over x \u2208 X\nthe values of f in \u03ba(y1 ), \u03ba(y2 ) \u2287 \u03ba(x) lie in \u03ba(x) (or in their perfect closures) and are\nidentical.\nProof. We have the commutative diagram\n\u0393(X, Otop )\n\n/ \u0393(Y, Otop )\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n/ \u0393(y1 , Otop ) = \u03ba(y1 ), \u0393(y2 , Otop ) = \u03ba(y2 ) .\n\n\u0393(x, Otop ) = \u03ba(x)\n\nIn this diagram the element f \u2208 \u0393(Y, OY ) \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(Y, Otop ) comes from an element f \u0303 \u2208\n\u0393(X, Otop ), since f \u2208 \u0393(Y, OY ) is compatible over X (both rings of global sections are\ncolimits of compatible elements over coverings). Hence the image of f in \u03ba(y1 ) and \u03ba(y2 )\n\n\f22\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\ncomes from f \u0303 via \u03ba(x). The same argument works if the fields are replaced by their perfect\nclosures.\n\u0003\nThe next lemma describes a situation where a lot of \"new\" global elements arise in\nthe Grothendieck topology. We will use this argument in Corollary 3.6.6, Theorem 4.3.3,\nProposition 6.1.6 and Proposition 7.3.8.\nLemma 1.6.7. Suppose that Y \u2212\u2192 X is a cover in a Grothendieck topology on X such\nthat the diagonal \u25b3 : Y \u2212\u2192 Y \u00d7X Y is a cover. Let F denote a sheaf of abelian groups on\nXtop . Then the restriction homomorphism \u0393(X, F) \u2212\u2192 \u0393(Y, F) is an isomorphism. This\nholds in particular if one (then both) projection Y \u00d7X Y \u2212\u2192 Y is an isomorphism.\nProof. We look at the exact complex\n\u03c11 \u2212\u03c12\n\n\u0393(X, F) \u2212\u2192 \u0393(Y, F) \u2212\u2192 \u0393(Y \u00d7X Y, F)\nand have to show that every element s \u2208 \u0393(Y, F) maps to 0 (the first mapping is injective\nanyway). The restriction homomorphism \u03c1(\u25b3) : \u0393(Y \u00d7X Y, F) \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(Y, F) comes from a\ncover and \u03c1(\u25b3)(\u03c11 (s) \u2212 \u03c12 (s)) = 0, so \u03c11 (s) \u2212 \u03c12 (s) = 0 as well.\nIf one projection is an isomorphism, then also the diagonal \u25b3 : Y \u2212\n\u2192 Y \u00d7X Y is an\n\u22121\nisomorphism, hence a cover. Then both projections equal \u25b3 .\n\u0003\n1.7. Filters and stalks.\nIn the \u00e9tale topology, the Henselization of the local ring Ox of a point x \u2208 X with\nseparably closed residue class field can be recovered by taken a suitable colimit over all\n\u00e9tale neighborhoods of that point ([24, D\u00e9finition VIII.4.3], [20, D\u00e9finition 18.6.5], [49,\nRemark I.4.11]). We will describe here how to get suitable colimits over reasonably filtered\nsystems in TX and in which sense it is possible to bring all coverings together into a single\nabsolute cover. Motivating examples for this are that all finite extensions of a domain\nare inside its absolute integral closure [36], or all Frobenius powers are inside the perfect\nclosure.\nDefinition 1.7.1. Let \u039b denote a small quasicofiltered category (Definition 1.2.1) with\na final object and let TX be a Grothendieck topology on a scheme X. Then we call\na covariant functor F : \u039b \u2212\n\u2192 C which respects the final object a quasifilter in TX . If\nmoreover \u039b is cofiltered, then we call F a filter. We write often U\u03bb or U\u03bb \u2212\n\u2192 X instead of\nF (\u03bb).\nSuppose that P is a presheaf on a Grothendieck topology TX with values in a category\nA and that F : \u039b \u2212\n\u2192 TX is a quasifilter. Then we get also a contravariant (quasifiltered)\ndiagram in A by looking at\nP \u25e6 F : \u039b \u2212\u2192 A, \u03bb 7\u2212\u2192 \u0393(U\u03bb , P) .\nIf \u03c1 : \u03bb \u2212\n\u2192 \u03bc belongs to \u039b, then we will denote the induced restriction morphism\n\u0393(U\u03bc , P) \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(U\u03bb , P) also by \u03c1 or \u03c1\u03bc\u03bb . If A is such that colimits over (certain) diagrams\nexist, then we denote the colimit by\nPF := lim \u0393(U\u03bb , P)\n\u2212\u2192\n\u03bb\u2208\u039b\n\nand call it the stalk of P in F .\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n23\n\nConstruction 1.7.2. Let TX be a Grothendieck topology on X and fix a scheme morphism Z \u2212\n\u2192 X (we call this a fixation). This defines a quasifilter in the following way:\nLet the indexing category \u039b = \u039bZ = \u039bZ \u2212\n\u2192X be given by (isomorphism types of) all\ncommutative diagrams\n>U\n~~\n~~\n~\n\u000f\n~~\n/X\nZ\n\nas objects, where U \u2212\n\u2192 X is in TX (so the objects are the Z-pointed open sets in TX ),\nand by all the morphisms U \u2212\n\u2192 U \u2032 in TX which commute with the fixations Z \u2212\n\u2192 U and\nid\n\nZ\u2212\n\u2192 U \u2032 . The final object is given by Z \u2212\n\u2192X\u2212\n\u2192 X. If two diagrams Z \u2212\n\u2192U \u2212\n\u2192 X and\n\u2032\n\u2032\nZ \u2212\n\u2192U \u2212\n\u2192 X are given over Z \u2212\n\u2192 U0 \u2212\n\u2192 X (that is, U, U \u2212\n\u2192 U0 fixing Z), then they\ncome together in Z \u2212\n\u2192 U \u00d7U0 U \u2032 \u2212\n\u2192 X (arbitrary products exist in TX ). Hence \u039b is a\nquasicofiltered category. The corresponding quasifilter is given by sending\n\u039b \u2212\u2192 TX , (Z \u2212\n\u2192U \u2212\n\u2192 X) 7\u2212\u2192 (U \u2212\n\u2192 X) ,\ni.e. by forgetting Z \u2212\n\u2192 U.\nIf TX is the full category of finite type over X (a big site) and the topology is affine,\nthen an affine fixation Z = Spec H yields even a filter. If \u03c81 , \u03c82 : U \u21d2 U \u2032 are given\ncorresponding to \u03c81 , \u03c82 : B \u2032 \u21d2 B, then B \u2297B \u2032 B/(\u03c81 (c) \u2297 1 \u2212 1 \u2297 \u03c82 (c), c \u2208 B \u2032 ) gives the\nequalizer which belongs then to the category.\nExample 1.7.3. An important case is when Z = Spec K is the affine spectrum of an\nalgebraically closed field K, in which case Z \u2212\n\u2192 X is called a geometric point. Goodwillie\nand Lichtenbaum call in [17, Section 2] a scheme P a point in a Grothendieck topology\nif for every covering Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U , i \u2208 I, and every morphism P \u2212\n\u2192 U there exists a lifting\nP \u2212\n\u2192 Ui for some i. If the topology is such that all coverings are surjective and of finite\ntype, then every geometric point is also a point in this sense.\nExample 1.7.4. In a Grothendieck topology the quasifilter given by a fixation is in\ngeneral not a filter. Consider the category of finite non-empty sets where only surjective\nmorphisms are allowed and are covers. This is the same as the affine single-handed covering\nZariski topology on X = Spec K, K a field. The identity X \u2212\n\u2192 X gives a fixation and an\n(absolute) quasifilter, the objects in this quasifilter are the pointed sets. Let W consist\nof the two points P0 (fixed) and P1 and let V consist of three points Q0 (fixed), Q1 and\nQ2 . Let \u03c81 and \u03c82 be given by \u03c81 (Q0 ) = \u03c82 (Q0 ) = P0 , \u03c81 (Q1 ) = \u03c82 (Q1 ) = P1 , and\n\u03c81 (Q2 ) = P0 , \u03c82 (Q2 ) = P1 . Then there does not exist a surjective map U \u2212\n\u2192 V which\nunifies the two morphisms.\nConsider the sheaf V \u2212\n\u2192 K V = \u0393(V, Otop ) and the diagram induced by the given\nU\nquasifilter. The colimit of this system as a diagram of sets is ( V K V )/ \u223c, where \u223c is\nthe equivalence relation in which f \u2208 K V and g \u2208 K W are equivalent if and only if there\nexists a set U and surjective mappings \u03c6 : U \u2212\n\u2192 V, \u03c8 : U \u2212\n\u2192 W with \u03c6\u2217 (f ) = \u03c8 \u2217 (g).\nThis is true if and only if f and g have the same values. Therefore the equivalence classes\nare given by finite unordered tupels of different elements in K.\nThis is however not a group, since it is not possible to define a group operation. Two\nelements f \u2208 K V and g \u2208 K W come together in some K U , but there are several choices,\nso their sum is not well defined. For each summand it is possible to bring the different\n\n\f24\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nchoices together, but not for both summands simultaneously. This example shows that\nProposition [12, Proposition A6.3] is wrong. The colimit in the category of groups is just\nK given by the evaluation at the fixed point.\n1.8. Irreducible filter.\nDefinition 1.8.1. We call a (quasi)filter F : \u039b \u2212\n\u2192 TX in a Grothendieck topology TX on\na scheme X irreducible if for every \u03bb \u2208 \u039b and every covering Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U\u03bb , i \u2208 I, there exists\ni \u2208 I and (\u03ba \u2212\n\u2192 \u03bb) \u2208 \u039b such that F (\u03ba \u2212\n\u2192 \u03bb) = U\u03ba \u2212\n\u2192 U\u03bb factors through Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U\u03bb via\nsome (U\u03ba \u2212\n\u2192 Ui ) \u2208 T X .\n\nExample 1.8.2. In an usual Stopological space, the filter of open neighborhoods of a\npoint is irreducible, because if i\u2208I Ui is a neighborhood of a point x, then Ui must be a\nneighborhood of x for at least one i.\nExample 1.8.3. If a Grothendieck topology over a scheme X has the property that\nevery covering is also set-theoretically a covering, then the quasifilter corresponding to a\ngeometric point Z = Spec K \u2212\n\u2192 X is irreducible. For if Spec K \u2212\n\u2192U \u2212\n\u2192 X is a given\nneighborhood of x and Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U , i \u2208 I, is a covering, then there exists i and Spec K \u2212\n\u2192 Ui\ncompatible with the given neighborhood.\nThe following lemma is a variant of the fact that for a point in a topological space the\nstalk of a presheaf and of its sheafification are the same.\nLemma 1.8.4. Let TX denote a Grothendieck topology on X, let F : \u039b \u2212\u2192 TX denote an\nirreducible filter. Let P denote a presheaf of abelian groups with sheafification P # . Then\nPF = (P # )F .\nProof. We have a natural homomorphism\n\nPF = lim \u0393(U\u03bb , P) \u2212\u2192 lim \u0393(U\u03bb , P # ) = (P # )F .\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\n\u03bb\u2208\u039b\n\n\u03bb\u2208\u039b\n\nSuppose that s \u2208 PF , represented by s \u2208 \u0393(U\u03bb , P), maps to 0 on the right. We may then\nassume that s = 0 in \u0393(U\u03bb , P # ) (because the colimit over a filter is the set theoretical\ncolimit). This means that there exists a covering Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U\u03bb , i \u2208 I, such that the restrictions\nU\u03bb\n\u2192 Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U\u03bb ) \u2208 F for some i \u2208 I, it follows that\n\u03c1Ui (s) \u2208 \u0393(Ui , P) are zero. Since (U\u03ba \u2212\ns = 0 in \u0393(U\u03ba , P) and hence in PF .\nNow suppose that s \u2208 (P # )F is represented by s \u2208 \u0393(U\u03bb , P # ), \u03bb \u2208 \u039b. This means that\nthere exists a covering Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U\u03bb , i \u2208 I, and elements si \u2208 \u0393(Ui , P) which are compatible\nin the sense that si = sj in \u0393(Ui \u00d7U\u03bb Uj , P1 ). Let (U\u03ba \u2212\n\u2192 Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U\u03bb ) \u2208 F . Then s = si on\nUi and also on U\u03ba , hence s comes from the left.\n\u0003\nCorollary 1.8.5. Let X = Spec R be endowed with an affine Grothendieck topology, let\nF : \u039b \u2212\u2192 TX denote an irreducible filter with structure stalk OF . Then for an R-module\nM we have (Mtop )F = M \u2297R OF .\n\nProof. We have by Lemma 1.8.4 and since tensor products commute with colimits the\nidentities (setting U\u03bb = Spec R\u03bb )\n(Mtop )F = lim \u0393(U\u03bb , Mtop ) = lim M \u2297R R\u03bb = M \u2297R (lim R\u03bb )\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\n\u03bb\u2208\u039b\n\n\u03bb\u2208\u039b\n\n\u03bb\u2208\u039b\n\n= M \u2297R (lim \u0393(U\u03bb , Otop )) = M \u2297R OF .\n\u2212\u2192\n\u03bb\u2208\u039b\n\n\u0003\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n25\n\nProposition 1.8.6. Let TR denote a Grothendieck topology on Spec R, let R \u2212\u2192 H be a\nring homomorphism defining a quasifilter F by the small indexing category\n\u039bR\u2212\u2192H = {[R \u2212\u2192 B \u2212\u2192 H], (R \u2212\u2192 B) \u2208 TR }\n\n(here [ ] denotes the isomorphy class). Suppose that F is irreducible and let OF denote\nthe stalk of the structure sheaf in F . Suppose in the first two statements that F is a filter.\nThen the following holds.\n(i) There exists a natural ring homomorphism OF \u2212\u2192 H.\n(ii) Suppose that R \u2212\u2192 R[T ] is a cover in the topology. Then OF \u2212\u2192 H is a surjection.\n(iii) Suppose now that for each R \u2212\u2192 B \u2212\u2192 H in \u039bR\u2212\u2192H the image B of B in H has\nthe property that the induced homomorphism B \u2212\u2192 B belongs also to TR . Then F\nis a filter and the stalk OF is a subring of H.\nProof. (i). We always have a ring homomorphism lim\u03bb\u2208\u039b B\u03bb \u2212\n\u2192 H, and OF = lim\u03bb\u2208\u039b B\u03bb\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\nby Lemma 1.8.4 if F is an irreducible filter. (ii). For a \u2208 H consider the index \u03bb given by\nR \u2212\u2192 R[T ] \u2212\u2192 H, T 7\u2212\u2192 a .\nThen the image of T \u2208 B\u03bb in the colimit lim\u03bb\u2208\u039b B\u03bb (which is OF ) maps to a.\n\u2212\u2192\nWe have to verify property (ii) in Definition 1.2.1 for the indexing category \u039bH . So\nassume that the first two rows of the following diagram commute.\nR\n=\n\n\u2744\n\nR\n=\n\n\u2744\n\nR\n\n\u2732 B\u2032\n\u03c81\n\n\u03c82\n\n\u2732H\n=\n\n\u2744\n\u2744\n\u2732 B\n\n\u2744\n\u2732H\n\n\u03c6\n\n=\n\n\u2744\n\u2732 B\n\n\u2744\n\u2732H\n\n\u03bc\n\u273b\n\u273b\n\n\u03bb\n\u273b\n\n\u03ba\n\nThis can be commutatively extended to the third row, and the homomorphisms \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c81 , \u03c6 \u25e6\n\u03c82 : B \u2032 \u2212\n\u2192 B are identical, since they are identical as homomorphisms to H.\nSuppose that f \u2208 OF maps to 0 in H, represented by f \u2208 B\u03bb . Then the image of f in\nB\u03bb \u2212\n\u2192 B\u03bb \u2212\n\u2192 H is 0 and so f = 0 in OF .\n\u0003\n1.9. Absolute filters and absolute stalks.\nWith absolute filters and absolute stalks we want to introduce a concept which is supposed to control all covers in a single-handed Grothendieck topology and contains in some\nsense all the information of the topology. The absolute stalk contains in particular the\ninformation about the induced closure operation (Corollary 2.4.10). A leading and motivating example is the role of the absolute integral closure R+ of a domain which controls\nthe plus closure, see Part 5.\nDefinition 1.9.1. We call a (quasi)filter F : \u039b \u2212\n\u2192 TX in a Grothendieck topology TX\nover X absolute if U\u03bb \u2212\n\u2192 X is a cover for every \u03bb \u2208 \u039b and if for every cover Y \u2212\n\u2192 U\u03bb in TX\n(\u03bb \u2208 \u039b) there exists \u03ba \u2208 \u039b and a factorization U\u03ba \u2212\n\u2192Y \u2212\n\u2192 U\u03bb (so that the composition\ncomes from \u03ba \u2212\n\u2192 \u03bb). We call the stalk of a presheaf S in an absolute filter an absolute\nstalk.\n\n\f26\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nRemark 1.9.2. An absolute quasifilter has in particular the property that for every cover\nY \u2212\n\u2192 X there exists U\u03bb \u2212\n\u2192Y \u2212\n\u2192 X, as X = U\u03bb0 for the final element \u03bb0 \u2208 \u039b. We will\nalso encounter the condition that every morphism U\u03ba \u2212\n\u2192 U\u03bb indicated by F is a cover,\nand the stronger property that every morphism Y \u2212\n\u2192 U\u03bb in TX is a cover for every \u03bb \u2208 \u039b.\nSee Proposition 1.10.4 and Examples 5.3.2 and 5.3.3 in the finite topology, where these\nconditions occur naturally. If F is given in an affine single-handed Grothendieck topology\nby a fixation R \u2212\n\u2192 H, then this quasifilter is absolute if R \u2212\n\u2192 S \u2212\n\u2192 H implies that\nR\u2212\n\u2192 S is a cover and that for given S \u2212\n\u2192 H and a cover S \u2212\n\u2192 T there exists an S-algebra\nhomomorphism T \u2212\n\u2192 H.\nDefinition 1.9.3. A scheme morphism Z \u2212\n\u2192 X (not necessarily in TX ) is called an\nabsolute cover if a morphism U \u2212\n\u2192 X in TX is a cover if and only if there exists a\nfactorization Z \u2212\n\u2192U \u2212\n\u2192 X.\nLemma 1.9.4. Let TX be a single-handed Grothendieck topology on a scheme X. Then\nthe following hold.\n(i) An absolute quasifilter F : \u039b \u2212\u2192 TX is irreducible.\n(ii) An irreducible quasifilter F : \u039b \u2212\u2192 TX with the property that every U\u03bb , \u03bb \u2208 \u039b, is a\ncover of X, is absolute.\nProof. (i). If U \u2212\n\u2192 U\u03bb is a cover (there are only single covers), \u03bb \u2208 \u039b, then there exists\n\u03ba \u2208 \u039b and morphisms U\u03ba \u2212\n\u2192U \u2212\n\u2192 U\u03bb , where (U\u03ba \u2212\n\u2192 U\u03bb ) = F (\u03ba \u2212\n\u2192 \u03bb).\n(ii). We have to check the second condition of an absolute filter, so let Y \u2212\n\u2192 U\u03bb be a\ncover. Then by irreducibility there exists a \u03ba \u2208 \u039b and a factorization U\u03ba \u2212\n\u2192Y \u2212\n\u2192 U\u03bb . \u0003\nLemma 1.9.4(i) is not true for non single-handed Grothendieck topologies, see Proposition 7.1.1(iv) for an example.\nLemma 1.9.5. Let X denote a scheme with a Grothendieck topology TX and an absolute\nfilter F : \u039b \u2212\u2192 TX . Let S denote a sheaf of abelian groups on Xtop . Then the natural\nhomomorphism \u0393(Xtop , S) \u2212\u2192 SF is injective.\nProof. If s \u2208 \u0393(Xtop , S) becomes 0 in the absolute stalk, then it must be 0 in \u0393(U\u03bb , S) for\nsome U\u03bb \u2212\n\u2192 X, \u03bb \u2208 \u039b. Because U\u03bb \u2212\n\u2192 X is a cover, s must itself be 0 by the local nature\nof a sheaf.\n\u0003\nCorollary 1.9.6. Let TX denote a single-handed Grothendieck topology on a scheme X.\nLet M denote an OX -module and let Mtop denote the corresponding sheaf (of abelian\ngroups) in the topology. Let \u039b \u2212\u2192 TX denote an absolute filter. Then the absolute\nstalk is lim\u03bb\u2208\u039b \u0393(U\u03bb , j\u03bb\u2217 (M )) = lim\u03bb\u2208\u039b \u0393(U\u03bb , Mtop ). In the affine case this means that\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\nlim\u03bb\u2208\u039b M \u2297R R\u03bb = lim\u03bb\u2208\u039b \u0393(R\u03bb , Mtop ).\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\nProof. This follows from Lemma 1.8.4, Lemma 1.9.4(i) and Proposition 1.5.5(iv).\n\u0003\nExample 1.9.7. Let X = Spec R be an affine scheme with the single-handed Zariski\ntopology (Example 1.5.8). Then every global function g = (gi ), gi \u2208 \u0393(Ui , O), over a cover\nU\n\u2192 X will yield an element in an absolute\nstalk, so this cannot be an easy object.\ni\u2208I Ui \u2212\nQ\nWe look at the fixation given by Z = Spec( p\u2208X Rp ). An object in the corresponding\nU\n\u2192 X, Ui = Spec Rfi , together\nquasifilter is given (after refinement) by a covering i Ui \u2212\nwith a morphism Q\nfrom Z to the covering. Such a morphism is given by a family of ring\n\u2192 Rp for every p, and they are given by an ith projection\nhomomorphisms i\u2208I Rfi \u2212\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n27\n\n(where i = i(p) is such that p \u2208 D(fQ\n\u2192R\n. This quasifilter\nis\ni )) and followed by Rfi \u2212\nQ\nQp\n\u2192 j\u2208J Rgj\n\u2192 Rp and a cover i\u2208I Rfi \u2212\nabsolute, since\nfor a homomorphism i\u2208I Rfi \u2212\nQ\n\u2192 Rp .\nthere exists j\u2208J Rgj \u2212\nQ\nQ\nQ\nAssume now that R is Ua domain. The image of i\u2208I Rfi inside Rp is i\u2208J Rfi for\na subset J \u2286 I so that i\u2208J Ui \u2212\n\u2192 X is also cover. So by Proposition 1.8.6(iii) this\nquasifilter is a filter. Hence the absolute stalk is given by\n{(hp ), hp \u2208 Rp , \u2203(f1 , . . . , fn ) = (1) and ai , ki such that hp = ai /fiki for some i} .\nIn this construction one can also restrict to the product over all local rings at maximal\nideals, but the resulting absolute stalk is different. For a local ring R the fixation by R\nis an absolute filter with absolute stalk R. If we fix by R \u2212\n\u2192 R/mR then this defines\nthe same filter with again R as stalk (but the condition in Proposition 1.8.6(iii) is not\nfulfilled). If say R is a discrete valuation domain and we fix by R \u00d7 Q(R) (as described in\nthe first paragraph), then the resulting absolute stalk is R \u00d7 Q(R).\n1.10. Exactness.\nAn exact sequence of OX -modules yields an exact sequence of sheaves in the flat (or the\n\u00e9tale) topology (in the small site), but not in an arbitrary Grothendieck topology. The\nexactness of a complex of sheaves in a non-flat topology is a phenomenon in its own right,\nwhich we study here and in later sections for several topologies.\nThe exactness in the topology is in general quite a strong condition, in particular if TX\nis big (this is already true for the big Zariski site). For example, if f \u2208 R is a non-zero\nf\n\ndivisor, then 0 \u2212\n\u2192R\u2212\n\u2192 R is exact, but as soon as there is one object S \u2208 TR where f is\na zero divisor, the corresponding complex of sheaves is not exact anymore. Therefore we\nwill also deal with weaker exactness properties.\nCorollary 1.10.1. Let X = Spec R denote an affine scheme endowed with an affine\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n\nsingle-handed Grothendieck topology TX . Let N \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 L denote a complex of R\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n\nmodules, and let N top \u2212\u2192 M top \u2212\u2192 Ltop denote the corresponding complex of sheaves in\nthe topology. Then the following are equivalent.\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n\n(i) The sheaf complex N top \u2212\u2192 M top \u2212\u2192 Ltop is exact.\n(ii) For every ring homomorphism R \u2212\u2192 S in TR and every s \u2208 \u0393(S, Mtop ) such that\n\u03b2(s) = 0 in \u0393(S, Ltop ) there exists a cover S \u2212\u2192 S \u2032 and t \u2208 \u0393(S \u2032 , Ntop ) such that\n\u03b1(t) equals the restriction of s to \u0393(S \u2032 , Mtop ).\n(iii) For every ring homomorphism R \u2212\u2192 S in TR and every s \u2208 M \u2297R S such that\n\u03b2(s) = 0 in L\u2297R S there exists a cover S \u2212\u2192 S \u2032 and s \u2208 N \u2297R S \u2032 such that s = \u03b1(t)\nin M \u2297R S \u2032 .\nProof. (ii) is just the formulation of the exactness of a complex of sheaves (Section 1.2)\nin the given affine single-handed Grothendieck topology. (iii) is the formulation for TR exactness (Definition 1.2.3) for the complex of presheaves given by tensoration with R \u2212\n\u2192\nS. Hence the equivalence (ii)\u21d4 (iii) follows from Proposition 1.2.4(iii) and Proposition\n1.5.5(iii).\n\u0003\nA complex G \u2212\n\u2192F \u2212\n\u2192 E of sheaves on a Grothendieck topology TX on X yields also a\ncomplex in a (quasi-)filter F : \u039b \u2212\n\u2192 TX . Its exactness can be characterized as follows.\n\n\f28\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nLemma 1.10.2. Let X denote a scheme together with a Grothendieck topology TX , let\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b1\n\nF : \u039b \u2212\u2192 TX denote a filter and let G \u2212\u2192 F \u2212\u2192 E denote a complex of abelian sheaves.\nThen the following are equivalent.\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b1\n\n(i) The complex is exact in F , that is, the stalk complex G F \u2212\u2192 F F \u2212\u2192 E F is exact.\n(ii) For all s \u2208 \u0393(U\u03bb , F) such that \u03b2(s) = 0 in \u0393(U\u03bb , E) (\u03bb \u2208 \u039b) there exists U\u03ba \u2212\u2192 U\u03bb\n(indexed by \u03ba \u2212\u2192 \u03bb in \u039b) and t \u2208 \u0393(U\u03ba , G) such that \u03b1(t) = \u03c1\u03bb\u03ba (s) in \u0393(U\u03ba , F).\nProof. (i) \u21d2 (ii). Since \u03b2(s) = 0 in \u0393(U\u03bb , E), this holds also in EF . Hence there exists\nt \u2208 GF such that \u03b1(t) = s in FF . So there exists U\u03ba , \u03ba \u2208 \u039b, such that t is represented by\nt \u2208 \u0393(U\u03ba , G) and such that \u03b1(t) = \u03c1\u03bb\u03ba (s) holds in \u0393(U\u03ba , F).\n(ii) \u21d2 (i).

So by (ii) there exists U\u03ba \u2212\n\u2192 U\u03bb and t \u2208 \u0393(U\u03ba , G) mapping to \u03c1\u03bb\u03ba (s),\nand this is then also true in the stalk.\n\u0003\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n\nLemma 1.10.3. Let TX denote a Grothendieck topology on X and let G \u2212\u2192 F \u2212\u2192 E denote\nan exact complex of sheaves of abelian groups on Xtop . Then the complex is exact in every\nirreducible filter. In particular it is exact in an absolute filter, if TX is single-handed.\nProof. Let F : \u039b \u2212\n\u2192 TX denote an irreducible filter. Let s \u2208 FF be represented by s \u2208\n\u0393(U\u03bb , F), \u03bb \u2208 \u039b, and suppose that \u03b2(s) = 0 in EF . We may assume that \u03b2(s) = 0\nin \u0393(U\u03bb , E). Due to exactness there exists a covering Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U\u03bb , i \u2208 I, and sections\n\u03bb\n(s)\nin\n\u0393(U\n,\nF).\nSince\nF is irreducible there\nti \u2208 \u0393(Ui , G), i \u2208 I, such that \u03b1(ti ) = \u03c1U\ni\nUi\ni\nexists i \u2208 I and \u03ba \u2208 \u039b such that (U\u03ba \u2212\n\u2192 Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U\u03bb ) \u2208 F . Then \u03c1U\nU\u03ba (ti ) maps to s in\nFF .\n\u0003\nWe characterize the exactness in an absolute filter.

(i) and (ii) are equivalent by Corollary 1.8.5. (iii) is the explicit version of (i)\n(Lemma 1.10.2) and (iv) is the explicit version of (ii). The implications (viii) \u21d2 (v), (v)\n\u21d2 (i)-(iv), (i)-(iv) \u21d2 (vi) and (vi) \u21d4 (vii) hold without further conditions, so we prove\nthem first. (viii) \u21d2 (v) is a restriction (Proposition 1.2.4).\n(v) \u21d2 (iii). In the given situation of (iii) there exists by (v) a cover Y \u2212\n\u2192 U\u03bb such that\nthe restriction of s comes from the left. By definition of an absolute filter there exists a\nmorphism U\u03ba \u2212\n\u2192 Y , and so the restriction of s to \u0393(U\u03ba , Mtop ) comes from an element in\n\u0393(U\u03ba , Ntop ).\n(iii) \u21d2 (vi). In the given situation there exists \u03bb \u2208 \u039b and a morphism U\u03bb \u2212\n\u2192 Y , since F\n\u2192 U\u03bb\nis an absolute filter. The condition holds also for \u03c1YU\u03bb (s) and by (iii) there exists U\u03ba \u2212\nsuch that s comes from an element in \u0393(U\u03ba , Ntop ). (vi) \u21d2 (vii) is trivial (Y \u2032 = U\u03ba ). For\n(vii) \u21d2 (vi) just take U\u03ba \u2212\n\u2192Y\u2032 \u2212\n\u2192Y.\nNow assume that the indicated morphisms in the filter are covers. Then (iii) \u21d2 (v) is\ntrivial.\n(vii) \u21d2 (iii) under the given assumption. Suppose the situation of (iii). There exists by\n(vii) a morphism Y \u2032 \u2212\n\u2192 U\u03bb , Y \u2032 \u2212\n\u2192 X a cover, such that the restriction of s to Y \u2032 comes\nfrom the left. By assumption on the filter, Y \u2032 \u2212\n\u2192 U\u03bb is a cover. Hence by the definition of\nan absolute filter there exists \u03ba \u2212\n\u2192 \u03bb and a factorization U\u03ba \u2212\n\u2192Y\u2032 \u2212\n\u2192 U\u03bb . If the topology\nis covering, then (vii) \u21d2 (viii) is trivial.\n\u0003\nFor an example where Proposition 1.10.4(vi) and (vii) hold, but not (i)-(v), see Example\n5.3.3.\n1.11. Cohomology.\nThe category of sheaves of abelian groups in a Grothendieck topology is an abelian\ncategory [49, Theorem II.2.15] and every abelian sheaf can be embedded into an injective\nsheaf [49, Proposition III.1.1]. In particular, a sheaf has an injective resolution and so it\nis possible to define cohomology of a sheaf as the derived functor for the functor of global\nsections F 7\u2192 \u0393(X, F) [27, Section III.1].\nWe will be interested in cohomology applied to a short exact sequence 0 \u2212\n\u2192 Syz \u2212\n\u2192\nf1 ,...,fn\n\nn\n\u2212\n\u2192 I top \u2212\n\u2192 0 given by ideal generators I = (f1 , . . . , fn ) \u2286 R, as this gives under\nOtop\ncertain conditions a bijection I top\u2212cl /I = H 1 ((Spec R)top , Syz) (Proposition 2.8.1). So\nthe first cohomology of the syzygy sheaf measures the difference between an ideal and its\nclosure induced by the Grothendieck topology. We will also compute that in the surjective\ntopology (in characteristic zero) and in the Frobenius topology the first cohomology of a\nquasicoherent module is zero (Theorem 3.10.2, Proposition 4.5.1) using \u010cech cohomology.\n\n\f30\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nTo review \u010cech cohomology let X be a site and let U = (Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U , i \u2208 I) be a covering\nof U \u2208 TX . We write Ui0 ...ik = Ui0 \u00d7U * * * \u00d7U Uik .

Explicitly,\nQ\n\u2192 C k+1 (U , P) by\nC k (U , P) = i0 ,...,ik \u0393(Ui0 ...ik , P) and the derivation is dk : C k (U , P) \u2212\nP\n\ni ***i\u02c7 ***i\n\nt\n0\nk+1\nt\nstands for the\nsending (dk s)i0 ,...,ik+1 = k+1\nt=0 (\u22121) \u03c1t (si0 ***i\u02c7t ***ik+1 ), where \u03c1t = \u03c1i0 ,...,ik+1\nrestriction to the projection qt . The homology groups of this complex are called the \u010cech\ncohomology groups and are denoted by \u021e k (Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U, P).\nIf Vj \u2212\n\u2192 U , j \u2208 J , is a second covering which refines U , then there exists a refinement\nhomomorphism \u021e k (U , P) \u2212\n\u2192 \u021e k (Vj \u2212\n\u2192 U, P). The \u010cech cohomology groups are defined\nk\nk\nas the colimit \u021e (U, P) = limU \u021e (U , P) over all coverings U of U [24, V.2.4.5]. For a\n\u2212\u2192\nsheaf P, \u021e 1 (U, P) equals the derived functor cohomology H 1 (U, P) [49, Corollary III.2.10].\nThe assumption in the next lemma holds in the constructible topology (Lemma 3.6.5,\nProposition 3.10.1) and in the Frobenius topology (Proposition 4.5.1) and generalizes\nLemma 1.6.7.\n\nLemma 1.11.1. Suppose that a cover Y \u2212\u2192 X in a Grothendieck topology on a scheme X\nhas the property that also the diagonal \u25b3 : Y \u2212\u2192 Y \u00d7X Y is a cover (this is in particular\nthe case if a projection Y \u00d7X Y \u2192 Y is an isomorphism). Then for a sheaf F of abelian\ngroups on Xtop we get in the \u010cech complex either the 0-map or the identity,\n0\n\nid\n\n0\n\n\u0393(X, F) \u2212\u2192 \u0393(Y, F) \u2212\u2192 \u0393(Y \u00d7X Y, F) \u2212\u2192 \u0393(Y \u00d7X Y \u00d7X Y, F) \u2212\u2192 .\n\nIt follows that the \u010cech cohomology is trivial, i.e. \u021e 0 (Y \u2212\u2192 X, F) = \u0393(Y, F) and\n\u021e k (Y \u2212\u2192 X, F) = 0 for k \u2265 1.\nProof. We show that \u03c1t = \u03c1(qt ) is the same mapping for every t. Since qt \u25e6 \u25b3t,t+1 =\nqt+1 \u25e6 \u25b3t,t+1 we get \u03c1(\u25b3t,t+1 ) \u25e6 \u03c1t = \u03c1(\u25b3t,t+1 ) \u25e6 \u03c1t+1 . As \u25b3 is a cover, also \u25b3t,t+1 is\na cover, hence it follows that \u03c1t = \u03c1t+1 . All these mappings are identities, since for a\ncover U \u2212\n\u2192 V with a covering section V \u2212\n\u2192 U the induced maps on a sheaf are always\nisomorphisms. In the \u010cech complex we have either an even or an odd alternating sum of\nidentities, so the sum is either 0 or the identity. The statements about the cohomology\nfollow.\n\u0003\nIt is also possible to define local cohomology for an open subset U \u2212\n\u2192 X in a Grothendieck\ntopology on X (see [24, V.6.3]). For an abelian sheaf F define\n\u0393X\u2212U (F) = {s \u2208 \u0393(X, F) : s|U = 0} = kern(\u03c1X\n\u2192 \u0393(U, F))\nU : \u0393(X, F) \u2212\n\n(X \u2212 U is just a symbol for us). This is again a left exact functor and gives rise to a derived\nk\nfunctor, denoted by HX\u2212U\n(\u2212). There exists a long exact sequence (as in [22, Corollaire\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n31\n\n1\nI.2.9]) 0 \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393X\u2212U (F) \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(X, F) \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(U, F) \u2212\n\u2192 HX\u2212U\n(F) \u2212\n\u2192 H 1 (X, F) \u2212\n\u2192 H 1 (U, F)\n[24, Proposition V.6.5]. We will use this in Section 2.8.\n\n2. Closure operations and Grothendieck topologies\nWe describe now how a Grothendieck topology on an affine scheme X = Spec R defines\na closure operation for R-submodules N \u2286 M and we characterize which closure operations can be obtained in this way. In general there will be several more or less natural\nGrothendieck topologies which realize the same closure operation. These Grothendieck\ntopologies come along with a variety of gadgets such as cohomology, ring and modules of\nglobal sections, notions of stalks and exactness, which we try to understand in the context\nof the closure operation.\n2.1. Forcing algebras.\nWe recall the definition of (universal) forcing algebras following Hochster [33]. Let R be\na commutative ring and let N \u2286 M denote R-modules such that M/N is finitely presented,\ns \u2208 M . This means that we have a resolution\nD\n\nR\u03bd \u2212\u2192 R\u03bc \u2212\u2192 M/N \u2212\u2192 0 ,\n\nwhere D = (rij )ij is a \u03bc \u00d7 \u03bd-matrix with entries in R. Let s\u0303 = (s1 , . . . , s\u03bc ) \u2208 R\u03bc denote a\nlifting of s. In this situation we make the following definition.\nDefinition 2.1.1. The finitely generated R-algebra\n\nX\n\nB = R[T1 , . . . , T\u03bd ]/(DT \u2212 s\u0303) = R[T1 , . . . , T\u03bd ]/(\n\nr1j Tj \u2212 s1 , . . . ,\n\nX\n\nr\u03bcj Tj \u2212 s\u03bc )\n\nis called a forcing algebra for (M, N, s). Accordingly, Spec B is called the forcing scheme.\nRemark 2.1.2. Note that the three sets of data (M, N, s), (R\u03bc , \u00d1 , s\u0303), where \u00d1 is the\nkernel of R\u03bc \u2212\n\u2192 M/N , and (M , 0, s), where M = M/N and s denotes the image of s,\nhave the same forcing algebras. This means that we may simplify the situation by either\npassing to a torsion-free submodule inside a free module or to the 0-submodule inside a\nmodule. Or the other way round: forcing algebras can only be helpful to understand such\nclosure operations which are independent of the presentation, see Proposition 2.2.6(iii).\nRemark 2.1.3. The construction of the forcing algebra is functorial with respect to ring\nhomomorphisms R \u2212\n\u2192 R\u2032 . By right exactness we get immediately the resolution\n\u03bd D\u2032\n\n\u03bc\n\nR\u2032 \u2212\u2192 R\u2032 \u2212\u2192 (M/N )\u2297R R\u2032 = M \u2032 /N \u2032 \u2212\u2192 0 ,\n\nwhere N \u2032 is the image of N \u2297R R\u2032 inside M \u2032 = M \u2297R R\u2032 , and the forcing algebra over R\u2032\nbuilt with D \u2032 is just B\u2297R R\u2032 .\nThe forcing algebra has the following universal property.\nProposition 2.1.4. Let R denote a commutative ring and let B denote a forcing algebra\nfor R-modules N \u2286 M such that M/N is finitely presented, s \u2208 M . Then the following\nholds.\n(i) The element s \u2297 1 lies in the image of N \u2297R B \u2212\u2192 M \u2297R B.\n(ii) If A is an R-algebra such that s \u2297 1 \u2208 im(N \u2297R A \u2212\u2192 M \u2297R A), then there exists\nan R-algebra homomorphism B \u2212\u2192 A.\n\n\f32\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nProof. We use the notation of Remark 2.1.2. The condition that s \u2297 1 \u2208 im(N \u2297R A \u2212\n\u2192\nM \u2297R A) is equivalent to the property that s \u2297 1 becomes 0 in (M/N )\u2297R A, and this is\nequivalent to the property that s\u0303 \u2297 1 in A\u03bc is in the\nimage of A\u03bd \u2212\n\u2192\nA\u03bc . This means\nP\nP\nthat the inhomogeneous linear system of equations\nr1j Tj \u2212 s1 , . . . , r\u03bcj Tj \u2212 s\u03bc has a\nsolution in A. For the forcing algebra B this is true by the very definition, which gives\n(i). (ii). If a solution over A exists, then we just have to send the variables Tj to the\ncorresponding coefficients in A, so there exists an R-algebra homomorphism B \u2212\n\u2192 A. \u0003\nRecall that a ring homomorphism R \u2212\n\u2192 A is called pure if for every R-module M the\ninduced map M \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2297R A is injective. For a pure homomorphism the contraction of\nan extended ideal is the ideal itself. Pure ring homomorphisms induce a spec-surjective\nmorphism. We note the following basic observation.\n\nLemma 2.1.5. Let R be a commutative ring. Let N \u2286 M be R-modules such that M/N\nis finitely presented, let s \u2208 M be an element. Let\nB = R[T1 , . . . , T\u03bd ]/(DT \u2212 s\u0303)\n\nbe the forcing algebra for (M, N, s). Then the following are equivalent.\n(i) s \u2208 N .\n(ii) There is a ring section B \u2212\u2192 R for R \u2212\u2192 B.\n(iii) R \u2212\u2192 B splits as a homomorphism of R-modules (that is, R is a direct summand\nin B).\n(iv) R \u2212\u2192 B is pure.\n\nProof. (i) \u21d2 (ii) follows from the universal property of a forcing algebra (Proposition\n2.1.4(ii)). The implications (ii) \u21d2 (iii) and (iii) \u21d2 (iv) hold for arbitrary ring homomorphisms. So suppose that (iv) holds. Apply the purity property to the R-module M/N . Let\ns denote the image of s in M/N . Then by Proposition 2.1.4(i) s becomes 0 in (M/N )\u2297R B,\nso it must be 0 by purety.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.1.6. Let R denote a commutative ring, and let I = (f1 , . . . , fn ) denote a finitely\nfi\n\ngenerated ideal, let f \u2208 R. In this case the resolution is just Rn \u2212\n\u2192R\u2212\n\u2192 R/I \u2212\n\u2192 0 and\nthe forcing algebra\nB = R[T1 , . . . , Tn ]/(f1 T1 + . . . + fn Tn + f )\nis given by one affine-linear equation. In this case we can add to the equivalent conditions\nin Lemma 2.1.5 the property that R \u2212\n\u2192 B is cyclic pure, which means by definition that\nIB \u2229 R = I for every ideal I \u2286 R.\n\n2.2. Admissible closure operations.\n\nThe closure operations we will consider will be defined for submodules in a certain class\nof modules and will be persistent with respect to certain ring homomorphisms. We fix the\nfollowing situation.\nSituation 2.2.1. Let G denote a subcategory of commutative rings and suppose that a\nsubcategory M = MR of R-modules is given for each R \u2208 G, such that for every ring\nhomomorphism \u03c6 : R \u2212\n\u2192 S in G the module M \u2297R S belongs to MS . A closure operation\nfor M is an assignment N 7\u2192 N c from MR to MR with N \u2286 N c = (N c )c . The closure\noperation is G-persistent if for \u03c6 : R \u2212\n\u2192 S in G one has im(N c ) \u2286 (N \u2032 )c in M \u2297R S, where\n\u2032\nN = im(N \u2297R S).\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n33\n\nRemark 2.2.2. The category G will be the full category of all rings, or all noetherian\nrings, all domains, all rings of characteristic p etc. We may also restrict the morphisms to\nhomomorphisms of finite type, inclusion of domains, etc.\nThe category of modules M will be either the category of all ideals (then we do not\ninsist that I\u2297R S belongs to MS ), or the category of all finitely generated R-module, or\nall torsion-free modules, or the category of all modules.\nDefinition 2.2.3. Let an assignment c on M as described in 2.2.1 be given. We call a\nforcing algebra B for (M, N, s) for R-modules N \u2286 M such that M/N is finitely presented\nadmissible (with respect to the closure operation) or c-admissible if s \u2208 N c .\nWe call a ring homomorphism \u03c6 : R \u2212\n\u2192 S c-pure if for every U \u2286 V in MR we have\nthat z \u2297 1 \u2208 im(U \u2297R S \u2212\n\u2192 V \u2297R S) implies that z \u2208 U c .\nProposition 2.2.4. Suppose the situation described in 2.2.1. Then the following holds.\n(i) R \u2212\u2192 S is c-pure if and only if for every forcing algebra R \u2212\u2192 B such that\nS \u2212\u2192 B\u2297R S = BS is c-admissible, then also R \u2212\u2192 B is c-admissible.\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c8\n\n(ii) The composition of two c-pure homomorphisms R \u2212\u2192 S \u2212\u2192 T is also c-pure.\n\nProof. (i). Let B be the forcing algebra for (M, N, s). Then s \u2297 1 is in the image of\nN \u2297R S \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2297R S if and only if s \u2297 1 is in the closure of the extended module N \u2032 . This\nis by definition equivalent to S \u2212\n\u2192 BS being c-admissible. That R \u2212\n\u2192 B is c-admissible is\nequivalent to s \u2208 N c .\n(ii) follows direct or from (i), since if R \u2212\n\u2192 B is a forcing algebra such that T \u2212\n\u2192 BT is\nadmissible, then first S \u2212\n\u2192 BS is admissible and then R \u2212\n\u2192 B is admissible.\n\u0003\nDefinition 2.2.5. Suppose the situation described in 2.2.1. We call c G-admissible, if the\nfollowing conditions hold.\n(i) c is a closure operation, that is, N \u2286 N c = (N c )c .\n(ii) The admissible forcing algebras are c-pure.\n(iii) The closure operation is G-persistent.\nProposition 2.2.6. Suppose that we have an admissible closure operation on a subcategory\nof noetherian rings and for finitely generated modules. Then the following hold.\n(i) (Module-persistence) Let N \u2286 M , s \u2208 M and let \u03c6 : M \u2212\u2192 M \u2032 be an R-module\nhomomorphism. Set N \u2032 := \u03c6(N ) and suppose that s \u2208 N c . Then also \u03c6(s) \u2208\n(N \u2032 )c .\n(ii) (Independence of presentation) Let N \u2286 M , s \u2208 M . Let p : M\u0303 \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 0 and\n\u00d1 := p\u22121 (N ) and let s\u0303 \u2208 M\u0303 be such that p(s\u0303) = s. Then s \u2208 N c if and only if\ns\u0303 \u2208 \u00d1 c . In particular, s \u2208 N c if and only if s \u2208 0c in M/N .\n(iii) The closure operation is order preserving, that is, for submodules N \u2286 L \u2286 M of\na finitely generated R-module M we have N c \u2286 Lc .\n(iv) Suppose also that the closure is persistent with respect to homomorpisms of finite\ntype. Let Ni \u2286 Mi , i = 1, . . . , k, be submodules and set N = N1 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 Nk \u2286\nM1 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 Mk = M . Then N c = N1c \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 Nkc , where Nic is the closure inside\nMi .\nProof. (i). Let R \u2212\n\u2192 B denote the (admissible) forcing algebra for (M, N, s). Then s \u2297 1\nis in the image of N \u2297R B \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2297R B. But then \u03c6(s) \u2297 1 is in the image of N \u2032 \u2297R B \u2212\n\u2192\n\u2032\nM \u2297R B.\n\n\f34\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\n(ii). One direction follows from (i). For the other direction suppose that s \u2208 N c , let B\ndenote a forcing algebra for these data. Then B is also the forcing algebra for (M\u0303 , \u00d1 , s\u0303).\n(iii) follows from (i) and (ii).\n(iv). By (ii) we may assume that N = 0. Let s = (s1 , . . . , sk ). If si \u2208 0c in Mi for every\ni, then the corresponding forcing algebras Bi are c-admissible, hence c-pure. Because\nof the persistence property this holds in the universal sense. Therefore also their tensor\nproduct B (which is the forcing algebra of s) is c-pure and since s = 0 in M \u2297R B we get\ns \u2208 0c . On the other hand, if s \u2208 0c , then also si \u2208 0c by applying (i) to the projections\nM\u2212\n\u2192 Mi .\n\u0003\nRemark 2.2.7. The module persistence of an admissible closure operation implies that\nthe assignment M 7\u2192 0c is a functor from R-Mod to itself (which is not a projection). An\ninclusion N \u2286 M yields to an inclusion 0cN \u2286 0cM , but this functor is neither exact in the\nmiddle nor does it respect surjections. The left exactness is related to hereditary torsion\ntheories; see Lemma 2.4.9 and Section 6.3.\nLemma 2.2.8. An order preserving closure operation for ideals in a local noetherian ring\n(R, m) is trivial if it is trivial for all m-primary ideals.\nProof. Let I \u2286 R and suppose that f \u2208 I c , f 6\u2208 I. If f is a unit, then also f \u2208 mc . So\nwe may assume that f is not a unit. Then there exists k \u2208 N such that f 6\u2208 I + mk (by\nKrull's intersection theorem [12, Corollary 5.4] applied to R/I). Then f \u2208 I c \u2286 (I + mk )c ,\nand the m-primary ideal I + mk is not c-closed.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.2.9. If an order preserving closure operation is given on an R-module M ,\nthen an arbitrary intersection of a family of closed submodules Nj = Njc , j \u2208 J, is again\nclosed. Therefore one can define a topology on M (in the usual sense) by declaring finite\nunions of closed submodules to be the closed subsets. As the union of two submodules is\na submodule only if one of them is contained in the other, the closed submodules in this\ntopology are exactly the closed submodules for the operation.\nExample 2.2.10. There are several examples of closure operations for ideals which are\ntrivial for m-primary ideals, but not in general, so these are not order preserving and\nhence not admissible (and not induced by a Grothendieck topology). E.g. the so-called\ntop-dimensional closure (or equidimensional hull [39, Definition 5.7]) of an ideal I \u2286 R =\nK[X1 , . . . , Xm ] (or more general) is given in the following way: let I = q1 \u2229 . . . \u2229 qr be a\nprimary decomposition such that qi is pi -primary and such that the p1 , . . . , ps (s \u2264 r) have\nminimal height (or R/pi has maximal dimension) among the pi . Then I top = q1 \u2229 . . . \u2229 qr .\nIf I is (X1 , . . . , Xm )-primary, then of course I top = I.\nT\n\nExample 2.2.11. The \"symbolic closure operation\" I 7\u2192 I\u2286p minimal prime R \u2229 IRp is\nnot admissible, since it is trivial on the primary ideals, but not in general. For a prime\nideal p this assignment maps the ordinary power pn to the symbolic power p(n) , [12, Section\n3.9]. See also Section 6.4, where the divisorial topology induces the symbolic powers for\nprime ideals of height one.\nS\nExample 2.2.12. The Ratliff-Rush closure of an ideal I \u2286 R is defined as I \u0303 = n\u22651 (I n+1 :\nI n ), see [56]. This closure is not an admissible closure operation, since it is not order\npreserving\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n35\n\nExample 2.2.13. The socle soc(M ) = {s \u2208 M : sm = 0} for an R-module over a local\nring (R, m) is not a closure operation. E.g. for R = K[x]/(x3 ) we get soc(R) = (x2 ), but\nits \"socle-closure\" would be (x).\nDefinition 2.2.14. Let c denote a closure operation on M. Consider for a pair N \u2286 M ,\ns \u2208 M , s \u2208 N c the properties\n(i) There exists an R-submodule N \u2286 M \u2032 \u2286 M such that s \u2208 M \u2032 , s \u2208 N c inside M \u2032\nand M \u2032 /N is finitely presented.\n(ii) There exists a finitely generated R-submodule N \u2032 \u2286 N such that s \u2208 (N \u2032 )c .\nWe say that the closure operation has the first finiteness property, if (i) holds (for every\nN \u2286 M ) and the second finiteness property, if (ii) holds.\n2.3. Examples of admissible closure operations.\nWe give some examples of admissible closure operations.\nExample 2.3.1. We consider the identical closure operation, where of course the conditions (i) and (iii) (for the category of all rings) in Definition 2.2.5 are fulfilled. The ring\nhomomorphisms R \u2212\n\u2192 A which are pure with respect to the identical closure operation\nare exactly the pure ring homomorphisms. An admissible forcing algebra for the trivial\nclosure operation is pure by Lemma 2.1.5, hence the identical closure is admissible.\nDefinition 2.3.2. Let D be a subcategory of rings. Such a category defines a closure\noperation for R-submodules N \u2286 M by declaring for s \u2208 M that s \u2208 N c if and only if\ns \u2297 1 \u2208 im(N \u2297R T \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2297R T ) for all ring homomorphisms R \u2212\n\u2192 T, T \u2208 D .\n\nWe call this the closure operation associated to D (the rings in D are the testrings).\nLemma 2.3.3. Let R be a commutative ring, let D be a category of rings with the induced\nclosure operation c. Let N \u2286 M be R-modules such that M/N is finitely presented, s \u2208 M ,\nlet B be the forcing algebra. Then the following are equivalent.\n(i) s \u2208 N c .\n(ii) For every R \u2212\u2192 T , T \u2208 D, the induced forcing algebra T \u2212\u2192 BT = B\u2297R T has a\nring section.\n(iii) For every R \u2212\u2192 T , T \u2208 D, the induced forcing algebra T \u2212\u2192 BT has an T -module\nsection.\n(iv) For every R \u2212\u2192 T , T \u2208 D, the induced forcing algebra T \u2212\u2192 BT is pure.\nProof. This follows from the functoriality of forcing algebras (Remark 2.1.3) and Lemma\n2.1.5.\n\u0003\nProposition 2.3.4. Let N 7\u2192 N c denote a closure operation given by a subcategory D of\nrings. Then this closure operation is admissible with respect to all ring homomorphisms.\nProof. It is clear that N \u2286 N c = (N c )c and that the closure is persistent for all ring\nhomomorphisms R \u2212\n\u2192 R\u2032 . By Lemma 2.3.3 a forcing algebra R \u2212\n\u2192 B is c-admissible\nif and only if for every R \u2212\n\u2192 T , T \u2208 D, the induced mapping T \u2212\n\u2192 BT = B\u2297R T has\na ring-section. But an R-algebra B with this last property is in general c-pure. For if\ns \u2297 1 \u2208 im(U \u2297R B \u2212\n\u2192 V \u2297R B) and if R \u2212\n\u2192 T , T \u2208 D is given, then we have a factorization\nR\u2212\n\u2192B\u2212\n\u2192 T showing that s \u2297 1 \u2208 im(U \u2297R T \u2212\n\u2192 V \u2297R T ).\n\u0003\nWe describe some closure operations coming from such a subcategory of rings.\n\n\f36\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nExample 2.3.5. Take D to be the category of fields. The corresponding ideal closure\noperation is the radical rad(I) of the ideal I, see Section 3.1. This closure operation\nis related to the surjective topology, where the coverings are given by spec-surjective\nmorphisms.\nExample 2.3.6. Suppose that R is a (noetherian) ring and let D be the category of\n(discrete) valuation domains. Then the induced closure operation is the integral closure,\nwhich we will study in its relation to the submersive topology in [4].\nExample 2.3.7. The weak subintegral closure was introduced by Leahy and Vitulli ([67],\n[59]). In [8] we show that crosses, i.e. one dimensional schemes consisting of two normal\ncomponents meeting in one point transversally give a category of test rings for this closure\noperation. The scheme of axes, i.e. one dimensional schemes consisting of normal components meeting transversally in one point and having maximal embedding dimension, yield\nalso an interesting category of test rings, which induce the so-called axes closure, which\nwe study in its relation to the continuous closure in [7].\nExample 2.3.8. Let D be the category of regular rings. Then the induced closure operation is the so-called regular closure [35]. The regular closure is clearly contained in the\nintegral closure and in the radical. It does contain the tight closure of an ideal, since tight\nclosure is persistent and every ideal in a regular ring is tightly closed [38, Theorem 2.3\nand Theorem 1.3(e)]. Therefore I \u2217 \u2286 I reg \u2286 I \u2286 rad(I).\n2.4. The closure operation induced by a Grothendieck topology.\nLet X denote a scheme endowed with a Grothendieck topology which is a refinement\nof the trivial topology (Example 1.5.2) (or of the single-handed Zariski topology (Remark\n1.5.8); which one should be clear from the context). This defines a site morphism \u03c6 :\nXtop \u2212\n\u2192 X, and we will specialize now the construction of extension and contraction\ndescribed in Section 1.4 to this situation. We could essentially develop all our topologies\nas refinements of the Zariski topology, however, this is sometimes unnecessary ballast, in\nparticular in the affine case.\nNotation 2.4.1. Let X be a scheme endowed with a Grothendieck topology such that\n\u03c6 : Xtop \u2212\n\u2192 X is a site morphism. For an OX -module M we denote the module pull-back\n(the sheafification) by Mtop = \u03c6\u2217 Let N \u2286 M denote OX -modules. Then the image sheaf\nof the induced OXtop -module morphisms \u03c6\u2217 (N ) = Ntop \u2212\n\u2192 \u03c6\u2217 (M ) = Mtop on Xtop is\ncalled the extended submodule of N \u2286 M in Mtop , denoted by N top = N ext . In particular,\nfor an ideal sheaf I \u2286 OX we call the image sheaf of Itop inside Otop the extended ideal\nsheaf, denoted by I top .\nFor an Otop -submodule H \u2286 Mtop we call the push forward sheaf on X given by U 7\u2192\n\u03b8 \u22121 (\u0393(\u03c6\u2217 (U ), H)), where \u03b8 : \u0393(U, M ) \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(\u03c6\u2217 (U ), Mtop ) is the natural mapping, the\ncont\ncontracted sheaf, denoted by H .\nFor N \u2286 M we call the contraction of the extension the closure sheaf or closure submodule (induced by the topology) of N inside M and denote it by N top\u2212cl = (N top )cont .\nProposition 2.4.2. Let X be a scheme endowed with a Grothendieck topology Xtop \u2212\u2192 X,\nlet N \u2286 M be OX -modules. Then the following holds.\n(i) The closure submodule N top\u2212cl is an OX -module (but in general not quasicoherent).\n(ii) We have N \u2286 N top\u2212cl = (N top\u2212cl )top\u2212cl .\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n37\n\n(iii) If \u03c6 : M \u2212\u2192 M \u2032 is an OX -module homomorphism to another OX -module M \u2032 and\nif N \u2032 \u2286 M \u2032 is a submodule, then \u03c6(N top\u2212cl ) \u2286 (\u03c6(N \u2032 ))top\u2212cl .\n(iv) Let N \u2286 N \u2032 \u2286 M be another submodule. Then N top\u2212cl \u2286 (N \u2032 )top\u2212cl .\n(v) Let \u03c0 : M \u2212\u2192 M/N . Then N top\u2212cl = \u03c0 \u22121 (0top\u2212cl ).\n\nProof. This is a special case of Proposition 1.4.4.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 2.4.3. We will apply Proposition 2.4.2 mainly in the case of a commutative\nring (an affine scheme X = Spec R endowed with the trivial topology) and an affine\nGrothendieck topology for R given by a certain class of R-algebras. For R-submodules\nN \u2286 M we get\nN 7\u2212\u2192 N pre 7\u2212\u2192 Ntop 7\u2212\u2192 N top 7\u2212\u2192 \u0393(Xtop , N top ) 7\u2212\u2192 \u03b8 \u22121 (\u0393(Xtop , N top )) .\n\nWe denote this R-submodule of M by N top\u2212cl . For an ideal I \u2286 R we get the assignment\nI 7\u2212\u2192 I pre 7\u2212\u2192 Itop 7\u2212\u2192 I top 7\u2212\u2192 \u0393(Xtop , I top ) 7\u2212\u2192 \u03b8 \u22121 (\u0393(Xtop , I top ))\n\nwhich is an ideal I top\u2212cl \u2286 R. In the case that N = 0 \u2286 M , we have N pre = Ntop =\nN top = 0 and the procedure simplifies to 0top\u2212cl = kern(\u03b8), i.e. an element s \u2208 M\nis in 0top\u2212cl if and only if it is annihilated by the global sheafification homomorphism\n\u03b8:M \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(Xtop , Mtop ).\n\nThe following Lemma describes explicitly the closure operation given by an affine\nGrothendieck topology.\nLemma 2.4.4. Let TX denote an affine Grothendieck topology on an affine scheme X =\nSpec R. Let N \u2286 M denote R-modules. Let s \u2208 M . Then s \u2208 N top\u2212cl if and only if there\nexists a covering R \u2212\u2192 Ri , i \u2208 I, and elements ti \u2208 N \u2297R Ri which map to s \u2297 1 under the\nnatural homomorphisms N \u2297R Ri \u2212\u2192 M \u2297R Ri for all i \u2208 I. If TX is quasicompact, then\nwe may restrict to finite index sets.\n\nProof. This follows from Lemma 1.4.5 applied to (Xtop , TX , Opre ) \u2212\n\u2192 X. Note that in\nthe notation of that Lemma we have U = X = V = Ui for all i \u2208 I, Vi = Spec Ri and\n\u0393(Vi , Opre ) = Ri .\n\u0003\nRemark 2.4.5. The condition that s \u2208 \u0393(Xtop , N top ) does only mean that s is locally\nin the image of Ntop \u2212\n\u2192 Mtop . The property that there exists a (global) element t \u2208\n\u0393(Xtop , Ntop ) mapping to s is a stronger condition, because such an element t is represented\nby compatible elements ti \u2208 N \u2297R Ri for some covering R \u2212\n\u2192 Ri , i \u2208 I. Also this deserves\ninterest, and there are topologies like the Frobenius topology and the surjective topology\nwhere both properties coincide (see Example 3.6.9, Theorem 3.9.1 and Proposition 4.4.1).\n\nWe are going to establish finiteness properties of the closure operation induced by a\nGrothendieck topology.\nLemma 2.4.6. Let R denote a commutative ring, M an R-module, A an R-algebra. Let\ns \u2208 M and suppose that s \u2297 1 = 0 in M \u2297R A. Then there exists a finitely generated Rsubmodule M \u2032 \u2286 M , s \u2208 M \u2032 , and an R-subalgebra A\u2032 \u2286 A of finite type such that s \u2297 1 = 0\nin M \u2032 \u2297R A\u2032 .\nProof. For this we have to go back to the definition of the tensor product, which is constructed by finite sums of formal tensor expressions v \u2297 a modulo certain relations. That\nan element in the tensor product is zero means that it is in the submodule generated by\nthe relations, and for that only finitely many data are needed.\n\u0003\n\n\f38\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nCorollary 2.4.7. Suppose that TX is a quasicompact Grothendieck topology on a scheme\nX. Then the closure operation induced by the topology fulfills both finiteness properties\nfrom Definition 2.2.14.\nProof. Suppose that s \u2208 N top\u2212cl , where N \u2286 M are R-modules. By Lemma 2.4.4 there\nexists a covering R \u2212\n\u2192 Ri , i \u2208 I finite, such that s \u2297 1 \u2208 M \u2297R Ri is the image of ti \u2208\nN \u2297 R Ri .\nFor the first finiteness property we may assume that N = 0. Since s \u2208 0top\u2212cl we have\nthat s \u2297 1 = 0 in M \u2297R Ri for every i \u2208 I. By Lemma 2.4.6 there exist finitely generated\nR-submodules Mi \u2286 M such that s \u2208 Mi and such that si = 0 in Mi \u2297R Ri . Then we can\ntake the finitely generated R-submodule RhMi , i \u2208 Ii \u2286 M .\nFor the second finiteness\nproperty there exist finitely many elements yj \u2208 N and rj \u2208 Ri ,\nP\nj \u2208 Ji , such that ti = j\u2208Ji yj \u2297 rj . This means then that s is already in the closure of\nthe finitely generated submodule L = Rhyj , j \u2208 Ji , i \u2208 Ii \u2286 N .\n\u0003\n\nTheorem 2.4.8. Let G denote a subcategory of rings, let TR denote an affine Grothendieck topology of finite type on Spec R, R \u2208 G, and suppose that every ring homomorphism\nR \u2212\u2192 S in G induces a site morphism (Spec S)top \u2212\u2192 (Spec R)top . Then the closure\noperation top \u2212 cl induced by the Grothendieck topology is a G-admissible closure operation\nfor all submodules.\n\nProof. That top \u2212 cl is a closure operation was mentioned in Proposition 2.4.2(ii).\nAdmissibility. Let s \u2208 N top\u2212cl and let B denote a forcing algebra (of finite type) for\n(M, N, s), where N \u2286 M is a finitely presented R-module and where s \u2208 N top\u2212cl . By\nLemma 2.4.4 there exists a covering R \u2212\n\u2192 Ri , i \u2208 I, such that s \u2297 1 \u2208 M \u2297R Ri lies in\nthe image of N \u2297R Ri . Then by the universal property (Proposition 2.1.4) of the forcing\nalgebra we have factorizations R \u2212\n\u2192B \u2212\n\u2192 Ri for all i \u2208 I. We have to show that B is\ntop \u2212 cl-pure. So let U \u2286 V and z \u2208 V be given and suppose that z \u2297 1 is in the image of\nU \u2297R B \u2212\n\u2192 V \u2297R B. Then it is also in the image of (U \u2297R B) \u2297B Ri \u223c\n= U \u2297R Ri in V \u2297R Ri\nfor every i \u2208 I, and so z \u2208 U top\u2212cl by Lemma 2.4.4.\nG-persistence. Again, let N \u2286 M and s \u2208 M . Let R \u2212\n\u2192 S denote a ring homomorphism\nin G with corresponding site morphism (Spec S)top \u2212\n\u2192 (Spec R)top . The condition s \u2208\nN top\u2212cl means by Lemma 2.4.4 that there exists a covering R \u2212\n\u2192 Ri , i \u2208 I, such that there\nexist ti \u2208 N \u2297R Ri mapping to s \u2297 1 in M \u2297R Ri . The pull-back S \u2212\n\u2192 Si := Ri \u2297R S, i \u2208 I,\ndefines a covering of (Spec S)top . For every i \u2208 I we have the commutative diagram\nN \u2297 R Ri\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nM \u2297 R Ri\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\n\u2297R S y\n\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\u2297 S\ny R\n\nN \u2297R Ri \u2297R S \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 M \u2297R Ri \u2297R S .\n\u223c\nNote that N \u2297R Ri \u2297R S = N \u2297R Si \u223c\n= (N \u2297R S) \u2297S Si (and also for M ), so the diagram\nshows that also s \u2297 1 \u2208 M \u2297R S has the property that (s \u2297 1) \u2297 1 \u2208 (M \u2297R S) \u2297S Si is in\nthe image of (N \u2297R S) \u2297S Si . This means by Lemma 2.4.4 that s \u2297 1 \u2208 (NS )top\u2212cl , where\nNS denotes the image module under N \u2297R S \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2297R S.\n\u0003\nAs mentioned in Lemma 1.3.6 the sheafification with respect to a Grothendieck topology\nis right exact. In general it is not left exact (Example 6.2.4). It is however exact for flat\ntopologies and for hereditary torsion theories, see Section 6.3.\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n39\n\nLemma 2.4.9. If the sheafification in a Grothendieck topology Xtop is left-exact, then also\nthe closure operation for the 0-submodule is left exact.\nProof. Let 0 \u2212\n\u2192 N \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2212\n\u2192 L \u2212\n\u2192 0 be an exact sequence of OX -modules. Suppose\nthat s \u2208 0top\u2212cl \u2286 \u0393(U, M ) maps to 0 in \u0393(U, L). Then s is the image of an element\nt \u2208 \u0393(U, N ). Since by assumption \u0393(U, Ntop ) \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(U, Mtop ) is injective and \u03b8(s) = 0, it\nfollows that \u03b8(t) = 0 in \u0393(U, Mtop ), hence t \u2208 0top\u2212cl in N .\n\u0003\nAn absolute stalk in the affine single-handed case contains the full information about the\nclosure operation. It is however in general not so easy to find an absolute stalk explicitly.\nCorollary 2.4.10. Let X = Spec R and let an affine single-handed Grothendieck topology TX be given on X with induced closure operation top \u2212 cl on submodules. Suppose that there exists an absolute filter F : \u039b \u2212\u2192 TX with absolute stalk R \u2212\u2192 H =\nlim\u03bb\u2208\u039b \u0393(R\u03bb , Otop ). Let N \u2286 M denote R-modules, s \u2208 M . Then s \u2208 N top\u2212cl if and\n\u2212\u2192\nonly if s \u2297 1 \u2208 im(N \u2297R H \u2212\u2192 M \u2297R H).\nProof. Suppose that s \u2208 N top\u2212cl . This means by Lemma 2.4.4 that there exists a cover\nR\u2212\n\u2192 R\u2032 such that s \u2297 1 \u2208 im(N \u2297R R\u2032 \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2297R R\u2032 ). By the definition of an absolute filter,\n\u2032\nthere exists \u03bb \u2208 \u039b and R \u2212\n\u2192 R\u03bb \u2212\n\u2192 lim\u03bb\u2208\u039b R\u03bb = lim\u03bb\u2208\u039b \u0393(R\u03bb , Otop ) = H (Corollary\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\n1.9.6). Hence s \u2297 1 \u2208 im(N \u2297R H \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2297R H). Suppose now on the other hand that this\nholds. This\nmeans that there exist elements tj \u2208 N and hj \u2208 H, j \u2208 J finite, such that\nP\ns \u2297 1 = j\u2208J hj tj in M \u2297R H. The hj are represented in some\nR\u03bbj and hence also in one\nP\nR\u03bb , \u03bb \u2208 \u039b. Since we have a filter, the equality s \u2297 1 = j\u2208J hj tj in the colimit holds\nalready in some covering R\u03bb \u2212\n\u2192 R\u03ba , hence s \u2208 N top\u2212cl by Lemma 2.4.4.\n\u0003\n2.5. Pure Grothendieck topologies.\nIf a Grothendieck topology is given on a subcategory G of rings, then there will be\ncertain rings R \u2208 G such that the induced closure operation is trivial, like F -pure rings in\nthe context of Frobenius closure/Frobenius topology or F -regular rings in the context of\ntight closure. Here we characterize the Grothendieck topologies where the induced closure\noperation is trivial.\nDefinition 2.5.1. We call a family of scheme-morphisms \u03c6i : Ui \u2212\n\u2192 X, i \u2208 I, pure if\nfor\nevery\nquasicoherent\nO\n-module\nM\nthe\nnatural\nmodule\nhomomorphism\n\u0393(X, M ) \u2212\n\u2192\nX\nL\n\u2217 (M )) is injective.\n\u0393(U\n,\n\u03c6\ni\ni\u2208I\ni\nWe call a Grothendieck topology on a scheme X pure if every covering of X in the\ntopology is pure.\nRemark 2.5.2. An affine single-handed Grothendieck topology is pure if and only if every\ncover R \u2212\n\u2192 R\u2032 is a pure homomorphism.\nProposition 2.5.3. Let Xtop be an affine scheme endowed with a Grothendieck topology.\nThen the following are equivalent.\n(i) The induced closure operation on submodules is trivial.\n(ii) The sheafification homomorphism \u03b8 : M \u2212\u2192 \u0393(Xtop , Mtop ) is injective for every\nR-module M .\n(iii) The Grothendieck topology is pure.\nIf the Grothendieck topology is quasicompact, then this is also equivalent to\n\n\f40\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\n(iv) The induced closure operation on submodules of finitely generated modules is trivial.\nMoreover, if X is noetherian, then this is also equivalent to\n(v) The induced closure operation on submodules in artinian modules is trivial.\nProof. (i) \u21d4 (ii) is clear from Proposition 2.4.2(v). (ii) \u21d2 (iii). Suppose that s \u2208 M\nbecomes 0 in every \u0393(Ui , \u03c6\u2217i M ), where \u03c6i : Ui \u2212\n\u2192 X, i \u2208 I, is a covering. Then this is also\ntrue for the element s considered in \u0393(Xtop , Mtop ). Hence s = 0 by (ii).\n(iii) \u21d2 (ii). If s = 0 in \u0393(Xtop , Mtop ), then it must be 0 on the presheaf level on some\ncovering (by the definition of sheafification).\nThe equivalence (i) \u21d4 (iv) follows from Corollary 2.4.7. Suppose now that X is also\nnoetherian, and that (v) holds. Let s \u2208 M , a finitely generated module, s 6= 0. Then\ns 6\u2208 mr M for some power of some maximal ideal m. Therefore s 6= 0 in the artinian module\nM/mr M and therefore s 6\u2208 0top\u2212cl by (v). Hence s 6\u2208 (mr M )top\u2212cl in M by Proposition\n2.2.6(iii) and in particular s 6\u2208 0top\u2212cl in M by Proposition 2.2.6(i) (or Proposition 2.4.2).\n\u0003\nRemark 2.5.4. In a pure topology the identity \u0393(Xtop , Mtop ) = M does not hold in\ngeneral. This is only true if for every object in TX the induced topology is pure. For\nexample, for the F -pure rings, i.e. the rings of positive characteristic which are pure in the\nFrobenius topology (see Proposition 4.2.4 and Theorem 4.3.3) we have \u0393(Rfrob , Ofrob ) =\nR\u221e .\nExample 2.5.5. In the pure affine single-handed Grothendieck topology only the pure\nring homomorphisms R \u2212\n\u2192 S are covers. Then M \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2297R S is by definition injective\nfor all R-modules M . Hence (M pre )0 = 0 and the associated presheaf M pre = (M pre )1\nis already separated. Therefore the closure operation induced by the pure topology is\ntrivial. As soon as an affine single-handed Grothendieck topology encompasses one nonpure covering R \u2212\n\u2192 S the closure operation is not trivial anymore.\n2.6. Grothendieck topologies which induce given closure operations.\nIn this section we show that every admissible closure operation for ideals (or submodules) comes from the closure operation induced by a suitable (not uniquely determined)\naffine single-handed Grothendieck topology.\nTheorem 2.6.1. Let G denote a subcategory of commutative rings which is closed under\nthe formation of forcing algebras. Suppose that we have an admissible G-persistent closure\noperation N 7\u2192 N c defined for submodules in a certain category M of finitely presented\nmodules. Then there exists an affine single-handed Grothendieck topology on every X =\nSpec R, R \u2208 G, such that the induced closure operation is N top\u2212cl = N c and such that the\nhomomorphisms R \u2212\u2192 S in G yield site morphisms (Spec S)top \u2212\u2192 (Spec R)top .\nProof. We look at the following topology on X = Spec R, R \u2208 G. Let the objects in TX\nbe given by (morphisms which are isomorphic to) compositions\nXk \u2212\u2192 . . . \u2212\u2192 X1 \u2212\u2192 X ,\nwhere each Xi+1 \u2212\n\u2192 Xi is an admissible forcing algebra for the closure operation. We\ndeclare such compositions to be the covers in TX and the only morphisms.\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n41\n\nWe have to check that this gives indeed a Grothendieck topology. The identity X \u2212\n\u2192X\nis the forcing algebra of the zero-data. The coverings are of course closed under composition. If Y \u2212\n\u2192 X is a G-morphism (in particular if Y \u2208 TX ), then we set Yi = Y \u00d7X Xi\nand because of Yi\u22121 \u00d7Xi\u22121 Xi = (Y \u00d7X Xi\u22121 ) \u00d7Xi\u22121 Xi = Y \u00d7X Xi = Yi the chain\nYk \u2212\u2192 . . . \u2212\u2192 Y1 \u2212\u2192 Y\n\nis again a composition of forcing algebras over Y . Note that these forcing algebras are\nagain c-admissible due to the G-persistence of the closure operation. Therefore TX is\nclosed under products, the covers respect base changes and every G-morphism yields a\nsite morphism.\nWe have to show that the closure operation top \u2212 cl given by this topology is the same\nas the given closure operation c. Let N \u2286 M , s \u2208 M , M/N finitely presented. Suppose\nfirst that s \u2208 N c . Then the forcing algebra R \u2212\n\u2192 B for these data is admissible and yields\ncover (by definition of the topology) such that s \u2297 1 is in the image of N \u2297R B. Therefore\ns \u2208 N top\u2212cl by Lemma 2.4.4.\nOn the other hand, if s \u2208 N top\u2212cl , then by Lemma 2.4.4 there exists a covering, that\nis, a composition\nR \u2212\u2192 B1 \u2212\u2192 . . . \u2212\u2192 Bk\nof admissible forcing algebras, such that s \u2297 1 is in the image of N \u2297R Bk \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2297 R Bk .\nSince by assumption the admissible forcing algebras are c-pure and since this is true for a\ncomposition (Proposition 2.2.4(ii)), it follows that s \u2208 N c .\n\u0003\nRemark 2.6.2. Different topologies may yield the same closure operation. The (somewhat artificial) topology constructed in the proof of Theorem 2.6.1 is the coarsest topology\nsuch that the admissible forcing algebras are covers. In general we will deal with other\nmore natural topologies which yield the same closure operation.\nProposition 2.6.3. Let D be a subcategory of test rings in the sense of Definition 2.3.2\nand let R be a commutative ring. For X = Spec R let TX be the full subcategory of finitely\ngenerated R-algebras. Let (X, TX ) be endowed with an affine single-handed Grothendieck\ntopology, where the covers \u03c6 : S \u2212\u2192 S \u2032 are given by one of the following conditions.\n(i) For every ring homomorphism \u03c8 : S \u2212\u2192 T , T \u2208 D, the induced ring homomorphism \u03c6T : T \u2212\u2192 S \u2032 \u2297S T has a ring section.\n(ii) For every ring homomorphism \u03c8 : S \u2212\u2192 T , T \u2208 D, the induced ring homomorphism \u03c6T : T \u2212\u2192 S \u2032 \u2297S T is an direct summand.\n(iii) For every ring homomorphism \u03c8 : S \u2212\u2192 T , T \u2208 D, the induced ring homomorphism \u03c6T : T \u2212\u2192 S \u2032 \u2297S T is pure (so \u03c6 is a D-pure homomorphisms).\nThen for finitely presented R-modules N \u2286 M we have N top\u2212cl = N D\u2212cl . If the closure\ninduced by D fulfills the first finiteness condition then this holds for arbitrary R-modules.\nProof. Note that the allowed covers are different, but the allowed forcing algebras in the\ntopology are the same under (i), (ii) and (iii) because of Lemma 2.1.5. Hence the three\nGrothendieck topologies induce the same closure operation, and we restrict to the pure\ncase (iii).\nSuppose that s \u2208 N top\u2212cl . This means by Lemma 2.4.4 that there is a cover R \u2212\n\u2192A\nsuch that s \u2297 1 \u2208 im(N \u2297R A \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2297R A). This means for \u03c8 : R \u2212\n\u2192 T , T \u2208 D, that\n\u03c8(s) \u2208 im(N \u2297R A\u2297R T \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2297R A\u2297R T ). Since T \u2212\n\u2192 A\u2297R T is pure it follows that\nalready \u03c8(s) \u2208 im(N \u2297R T \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2297R T ). Hence s \u2208 N D\u2212cl .\n\n\f42\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nIf, on the other hand, s \u2208 N D\u2212cl , then we consider the (finitely generated) forcing\nalgebra B. It follows that R \u2212\n\u2192 B is an allowed covering, since after base change to\n\u03c8:R\u2212\n\u2192 T it has even a ring section. Therefore s \u2208 N top\u2212cl again by Lemma 2.4.4.\nThe last statement is clear since the topological closure fulfills the finiteness conditions\nby Corollary 2.4.7 and so the identity reduces to the finite case.\n\u0003\n2.7. Exactness and closure operations.\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b1\n\nWe relate now for a complex N \u2212\n\u2192M \u2212\n\u2192 L of R-modules several notions of exactness\nin a given Grothendieck topology with the property that the kernel is contained in the\nclosure of the image.\nProposition 2.7.1. Let TX denote an affine single-handed Grothendieck topology on X =\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n\nSpec R. Let N \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 L denote a complex of R-modules. Consider the following\nproperties.\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n\n(i) The complex of sheaves N top \u2212\u2192 M top \u2212\u2192 Ltop on Xtop is exact.\n(ii) The complex of sheaves N top \u2212\u2192 M top \u2212\u2192 Ltop on Xtop is X-exact.\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b1\n\n(iii) The complex of presheaves N pre \u2212\u2192 M pre \u2212\u2192 Lpre on Xtop is X-exact.\n(iv) kern \u03b2 \u2286 (im \u03b1)top\u2212cl , where top \u2212 cl denotes the closure operation of the topology\n(inside M ).\nThen (i) \u21d2 (ii), (ii) \u21d2 (iii), (iii) and (iv) are equivalent. Moreover, if M \u2212\u2192 \u0393(Xtop , Mtop )\nis surjective and L \u2212\u2192 \u0393(Xtop , Ltop ) is injective, then also (ii) is equivalent to (iii) and\n(iv).\nProof. (i) \u21d2 (ii) and (ii) \u21d2 (iii) were given in Proposition 1.2.4.\n(iii) \u21d2 (iv). Let s \u2208 M , \u03b2(s) = 0. ByP\n(iii) there exists a cover R \u2212\n\u2192 S and t \u2208 N \u2297R S\nmapping to s \u2297 1. We may write t = j\u2208J tj \u2297 hj , tj \u2208 N , hj \u2208 S. Then of course\n\u03b1(tj ) \u2208 im(\u03b1) and so s \u2297 1 \u2208 im((im \u03b1)\u2297R S \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2297R S), hence s \u2208 (im \u03b1)top\u2212cl .\n(iv) \u21d2 (iii). Again let s \u2208 M , \u03b2(s) = 0, so that s \u2208 (im \u03b1)top\u2212cl by (iv). This means by\nLemma 2.4.4 that there exists a cover\nR\u2212\n\u2192 S such that s\u22971 \u2208 im((im \u03b1)\u2297R S \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2297R S).\nP\nSo in particular there exists s\u0303 = j\u2208J sj \u2297 hj mapping to s \u2297 1, where sj = \u03b1(tj ), tj \u2208 N\nP\nand hj \u2208 S. But then also s \u2297 1 = \u03b1( j\u2208J tj \u2297 hj ), so locally s is in the image of the\npresheaf given by N .\nNow suppose that (iii) holds and that M \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(Xtop , Mtop ) is surjective and L \u2212\n\u2192\n\u0393(Xtop , Ltop ) is injective. Then s \u2208 \u0393(Xtop , Mtop ) mapping to 0 comes from s \u2208 M , which\nalso maps to 0 in L. So there exists a cover R \u2212\n\u2192 S and t\u2032\u2208 N \u2297R S mapping to s \u2297 1 in\n\u2032\nM \u2297R S. Then also t \u2208 \u0393(S, Ntop ) maps to the restriction of s in \u0393(S, Mtop ).\n\u0003\nCorollary 2.7.2.

Everything follows from Proposition 2.7.1 except (iii) \u21d2 (i). We have to show\nthat the complex of sheaves is exact for every U \u2212\n\u2192 X in TX , and we may assume that\nU = X.

Then by (iii) we\ntop\u2212cl\nhave s \u2208 (im \u03b1)\n.

The equivalence of (i) and (ii) was given in Corollary 2.7.2. Suppose that (iii) holds.\nWe may assume that R = R\u2032 . Suppose that s \u2208 M maps to 0 in L and consider im(\u03b1) \u2286 M .\nLet \u03c8 : R \u2212\n\u2192 T be given, T \u2208 D. Then by assumption s \u2297 1 \u2208 im(N \u2297R T \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2297R T )\nand hence also s \u2297 1 \u2208 im(im(\u03b1)\u2297R T \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2297R T ). But this implies by Lemma 2.6.3 that\ns \u2208 (im(\u03b1))top\u2212cl .\nSuppose now that (ii) holds and let \u03c8 : R \u2212\n\u2192 T be given, T \u2208 D. Suppose that\nu \u2208 M \u2297R T is mapped to 0 in L\u2297R T . There exists by Lemma 2.4.6 a finitely generated\nR-algebra R\u2032 with a factorization R \u2212\n\u2192 R\u2032 \u2212\n\u2192 T and an element v \u2208 M \u2297R R\u2032 mapping\n\u2032\nto u and also mapping to 0 in L\u2297R R . Hence by (ii) v \u2208 (im(\u03b1))top\u2212cl . Therefore by\n\u2192 (M \u2297R R\u2032 ) \u2297R\u2032 T ). Since\nLemma 2.6.3 we know that u = v \u2297 1 \u2208 im(im(\u03b1) \u2297R\u2032 T \u2212\n\u2032\n\u2192\nN \u2297R R \u2212\n\u2192 im(\u03b1) is surjective, it follows also that u \u2208 im((N \u2297R R\u2032 ) \u2297R\u2032 T = N \u2297R T \u2212\n\u2032\n\u0003\n(M \u2297R R ) \u2297R\u2032 T ) = M \u2297R T ).\nExample 2.7.4. Let X = Spec R be an affine scheme endowed with a Grothendieck\ntopology TX . Let I = (f1 , . . . , fn ) \u2286 R denote an ideal with ideal closure I top\u2212cl 6= I.\nf1 ,...,fn\n\nThen the complex Rn \u2212\u2192 R \u2212\u2192 R/I top\u2212cl is not exact as a complex of R-modules,\nbut the corresponding complex of presheaves is X-exact, because every element in I top\u2212cl\ncomes from the left under some covering.\n\nRemark 2.7.5. Complexes of R-modules with the property that the kernel is inside the\nclosure of the image (as in Proposition 2.7.1(iv)) were studied by several people with\n\n\f44\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nrespect to different closure operations. Katz studies complexes acyclic up to integral\nclosure [41] and Hochster and Huneke study phantom homology within the setting of\ntight closure [38, \u00a710].\nAn exact sequence of R-modules leads in general not to an exact sequence of sheaves.\nThere are however some cases when they do.\nProposition 2.7.6. Let R denote a commutative ring, 0 \u2212\u2192 N \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 L \u2212\u2192 0 an\nexact sequence of R-modules and let an affine single-handed Grothendieck topology be given\non X = Spec R. Then the complex of sheaves 0 \u2212\u2192 N top \u2212\u2192 M top \u2212\u2192 Ltop \u2212\u2192 0 is exact\nin the following cases.\n(i) The sequence splits.\n(ii) L is flat.\n(iii) N is pure in M .\nProof. We only have to show that the corresponding complex of presheaves is exact. (i) is\nclear, since the presheafifcation respects direct sums. (ii),(iii). For R \u2212\n\u2192 R\u2032 we have the\nexact sequence of presheaves\n\u2032\n\u2212\n\u2192 TorR\n\u2192 N \u2297R R \u2032 \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2297R R \u2032 \u2212\n\u2192 L\u2297R R\u2032 \u2212\n\u2192 0.\n1 (L, R ) \u2212\n\u2032\nIf L is flat, then TorR\n\u2192 M is pure,\n1 (L, R ) = 0, and the presheaf complex is exact.

Sheaf of syzygies and cohomological interpretation.\nWe want to relate the quotient N top\u2212cl /N with the first cohomology of the syzygy sheaf\nin the topology. We consider finitely generated R-modules N \u2286 M and a homomorphism\n\u03c3 : Rn \u2212\n\u2192 M such that the image of \u03c3 is N . Let a Grothendieck topology TX on\nX = Spec R be given. This yields a surjective homomorphism of sheaves\nn\n\u03c3 : Otop\n\u2212\u2192 N top \u2286 Mtop .\n\nThe kernel of this sheaf homomorphism is a sheaf on Xtop which we denote by Syz.\nNote that this kernel sheaf is not the sheafification of the kernel of the given R-module\nhomomorphisms.\nProposition 2.8.1. Let R denote a commutative ring with a Grothendieck topology TX\non X = Spec R. Let N \u2286 M denote finitely generated R-modules and let Rn \u2212\u2192 M denote\nan R-module homomorphism with image N . Let Syz denote the kernel sheaf of the sheaf\nn \u2212\n\u2192 N top \u2286 Mtop . Then the following holds.\nmorphism Otop\n(i) We have a homomorphism N top\u2212cl/N \u2212\u2192 H 1 (Xtop ,Syz). If \u0393(Xtop ,Otop ) = R,\n\u0393(Xtop , Mtop ) = M and H 1 (Xtop , Otop ) = 0, then this is an isomorphism.\n(ii) Suppose that U \u2286 X is Zariski open, that TX is a refinement of the Zariski topology\nand that the support of M/N is outside of U . Set Y = X \u2212 U . Then we have a\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n45\n\ncommutative diagram\nN top\u2212cl /N\n\n/ M/N\n\n/ M/N top\u2212cl\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n/ \u0393(Utop , N top )/N\u0393(Utop , Otop )\n\n\u000f\n/ H 1 (N top )/im(H 1 (O n ))\nY\nY top\n\n\u0393(Xtop,N top )/N\u0393(Xtop , Otop )\n\u2286\n\n\u2286\n\n\u000f\n\n\u2286\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n\nH 1 (Xtop , Syz)\n\n/ HY2 (Syz) .\ntop\n\n/ H 1 (Utop , Syz)\n\nProof. We apply to the short exact sequence of sheaves on Xtop ,\nn\n0 \u2212\u2192 Syz \u2212\u2192 Otop\n\u2212\u2192 Ntop \u2212\u2192 0\n\nseveral cohomological functors, to wit, \u0393(Xtop , \u2212), \u0393(Utop , \u2212) and \u0393Ytop (\u2212), and get the\ncommutative diagram\n\u0393(Xtop , Otop )n\n\n/ \u0393(Utop , Otop )n\n\n/ H 1 (Otop )n\nY\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n/ \u0393(Utop , N top )\n\n\u000f\n/ H 1 (N top )\nY\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n/ H 1 (Utop , Syz)\n\n\u000f\n/ H 2 (Syz)\nY\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n/ H 1 (Utop , Otop )n\n\n\u000f\n/ H 2 (Otop )n .\nY\n\n\u0393(Xtop , N top )\n\nH 1 (Xtop , Syz)\n\nH 1 (Xtop , Otop )n\n\nNote that the image of \u0393(Xtop , Otop )n in \u0393(Xtop , N top ) is just N \u0393(Xtop , Otop ) (same for\nthe second column). From this everything in the lower half of the diagram in (ii) follows.\nThe first down arrow in the diagram in (ii) on the left comes from the sheafifying homomorphism \u03b8 : M \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(Xtop , Mtop ), where by definition N top\u2212cl is the submodule mapping\ntop\nto \u0393(X, N ) \u2286 \u0393(Xtop , Mtop ). This gives the first statement in (i). The other statement\nin (i) follows from the long exact sequence (in the first column), since \u0393(Xtop , Mtop ) = M\nimplies that \u0393(Xtop , N top ) = N top\u2212cl .\nSuppose now that the support of M/N is outside U , or equivalently that Rn \u2212\n\u2192 M is sur\u03c1\n\njective on U . Then we have N top = Mtop on Utop . The mapping M \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(Xtop , Mtop ) \u2212\n\u2192\n\u0393(Utop , Mtop ) = \u0393(Utop , N top ) induces the first mapping in the second column and the\nupper left square commutes.\nThe induced mapping M/N \u2212\n\u2192 HY1 (N top )/ im(HY1 (Otop )n ) sends N top\u2212cl 7\u2192 0, so it\ntop\u2212cl\nfactors through M/N\n.\n\u0003\n\nExample 2.8.2. We describe explicitly how a class [s] \u2208 N top\u2212cl /N gives a cohomology\nclass c = \u03b4([s]) \u2208 H 1 (Xtop , Syz) in the easiest case, that of a principal ideal I = (g) in\nan affine single-handed Grothendieck topology on X = Spec R. For U \u2208 TX we have the\ng\n\nsequence 0 \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(U, Syz) \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(U, Otop ) \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(U, I top ), so \u0393(U, Syz) = {h \u2208 \u0393(U, Otop ) :\nhg = 0} = Ann(g), which is zero if g is a non-zero divisor in \u0393(U, Otop ). If f \u2208 R and\n\n\f46\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nf \u2208 I top\u2212cl , then there exists a cover Y \u2212\n\u2192 X and an element q \u2208 \u0393(Y, Otop ) such that\nf = qg. Therefore over Y \u00d7X Y the element p\u22172 (q) \u2212 p\u22171 (q) maps to 0 in \u0393(Y \u00d7X Y, I top )\nand comes from an element in \u0393(Y \u00d7X Y, Syz). This element is a \u010cech representative of\n\u03b4(f ) \u2208 H 1 (X, Syz).\nThe \u010cech cohomology of the syzygy sheaf (which is in our case an annihilator sheaf of\none element) with respect to a cover \u021e 1 (Y \u2212\n\u2192 X, Syz) is computed as the homology of\nthe \u010cech complex \u0393(X, Syz) \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(Y, Syz) \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(Y \u00d7X Y, Syz) \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(Y \u00d7X Y \u00d7 Y, Syz). We\ncompute an example in the finite topology in Example 5.4.3.\nRemark 2.8.3. It is possible that two syzygy modules are isomorphic as R-modules\nand even isomorphic to the Zariski structure sheaf, but that they define different sheaves\nof syzygies in a Grothendieck topology. This is for example the case in the submersive\ntopology [4] for Syz(x, y) and Syz(x2 , y 2 ) on X = Spec K[x, y], which are both Zariskiisomorphic to OX . This is related to the fact that the containment f \u2208 (f1 , . . . , fn ) in the\nintegral closure is not a property of the Zariski cohomology class \u03b4(f ) \u2208 H 1 (D(f1 , . . . , fn ),\nSyz(f1 , . . . , fn )). For example, both data sets (x, y); 1 and (x2 , y 2 ); xy yield the same\nZariski cohomology class 1/xy \u2208 H 1 (D(x, y), OX ), but 1 6\u2208 (x, y) and xy \u2208 (x2 , y 2 ). This\nis also related to the fact that there exists no theory of test ideals for the integral closure.\n3. The surjective topology and the radical\nIn this part we describe our first main example, the radical of an ideal and its relationship to the surjective Grothendieck topology, where the coverings are given by affine\nspec-surjective morphisms.\n3.1. The radical of an ideal and of a submodule.\nThe radical of an ideal I \u2286 R is by definition\n\u221a\nI = rad(I) = {f \u2208 R : \u2203n \u2208 N such that f n \u2208 I} .\nThe radical is also the intersection of all prime ideals which contain I [12, Corollary 2.12].\nThe containment f \u2208 rad(I) is thus equivalent with \u03c8(f ) \u2208 IK for all ring homomorphisms\n\u03c8:R\u2212\n\u2192 K to fields.\nProposition 3.1.1. Let N \u2286 M denote R-modules such that M/N is finitely presented,\nlet s \u2208 M . Then the following are equivalent.\n(i) There exists a spec-surjective ring homomorphism R \u2212\u2192 A (of finite type) such\nthat s \u2297 1 \u2208 im(N \u2297R A \u2212\u2192 M \u2297R A).\n(ii) The forcing algebra B for (M, N, s) induces a surjective morphism Spec B \u2212\u2192\nSpec R.\n(iii) For all homomorphisms R \u2212\u2192 K to a field K we have s \u2297 1 \u2208 im(N \u2297R K \u2212\u2192\nM \u2297R K).\nProof. (i) \u21d2 (ii). By the universal property of the forcing algebra (Proposition 2.1.4) we\nhave a factorization Spec A \u2212\n\u2192 Spec B \u2212\n\u2192 Spec R, so also Spec B \u2212\n\u2192 Spec R is surjective\n(and B is of finite type). (ii) \u21d2 (i) is clear.\n(ii) \u21d4 (iii). By the functoriality of forcing algebras (Remark 2.1.3) B\u2297R K is the forcing\nalgebra for (M \u2297R K, N \u2032 , s \u2297 1), N \u2032 being the image of N \u2297R K in M \u2297R K. (ii) says that\nevery fiber is non-empty, and this is equivalent to the property that B\u2297R K 6= 0 for every\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n47\n\nR\u2212\n\u2192 K. This is equivalent to K \u2212\n\u2192 B\u2297R K being a direct summand, hence this is by\nLemma 2.1.5 equivalent to (iii).\n\u0003\nDefinition 3.1.2. For R-modules N \u2286 M we define the radical of N in M to be the\nsubmodule\nrad(N ) = {s \u2208 M : s \u2297 1 \u2208 im(N \u2297R K \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2297R K) for all fields R \u2212\n\u2192 K}.\nRemark 3.1.3. This definition gives clearly a submodule. If N and M are such that M/N\nis finitely presented, then the containment s \u2208 rad(N ) can be expressed by the equivalent\nproperties of Proposition 3.1.1. The radical is by Proposition 2.3.4 an admissible closure\noperation with respect to every ring homomorphism. This follows also from the topological\ninterpretation in Proposition 3.2.3 below.\nRemark 3.1.4. Let M denote an R-module and consider the 0-submodule. Then the\nradical of 0 consists of all elements s \u2208 M such that s \u2297 1 = 0 in M \u2297R K for all fields\nR\u2212\n\u2192 K.\nProposition 3.1.5. Suppose that R is a noetherian ring of finite dimension. Then the\nradical fulfills both finiteness properties from Definition 2.2.14.\nProof. Let N \u2286 M be R-modules, s \u2208 M and s \u2208 rad(N ). For the first finiteness property\nwe may assume that N = 0. Let pi , i \u2208 I, denote the finitely many minimal prime ideals of\nR. For all i we have s \u2297 1 = 0 in M \u2297R Q(R/pi ). Then there exist by Lemma 2.4.6 finitely\ngenerated R-submodules Mi \u2286 M such that s \u2208 Mi and s \u2297 1 = 0 in Mi \u2297R Q(R/pi ). The\nsame holds for the finitely generated submodule M\u0303 generated by the Mi . This means\nthat there exist fi 6\u2208 pi such that s \u2297 1 = 0 in M\u0303 \u2297R (R/pi )fi . Now if R \u2212\n\u2192 K is a\nhomomorphism to a field K, then either fi maps to a unit for some i or all fi map to 0.\nIn the first case the factorization R \u2212\n\u2192 Rf i \u2212\n\u2192 K shows that s \u2297 1 = 0 in M\u0303 \u2297R K. In the\nsecond case we look at the minimal primes of R/(fi , i \u2208 I) as before, which has smaller\ndimension, so we can (increasing the submodule M\u0303 ) argue inductively.\nThe proof of the second finiteness condition is similar.\n\u0003\nDefinition 3.1.6. For an R-module M we denote the factor module by M1 = M/ rad(0)\nand call it the R-reduction of M .\nThe R-reduction of an R-module M yields indeed the separated presheaf in the surjective topology, as we will see in a minute.\nExample 3.1.7. Let R denote a principal ideal domain. Then every finitely generated\nR-module M is isomorphic to M \u223c\n= Rk \u00d7 M (p1 ) \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 M (pm ), where p1 , . . . , pm are non\nassociated prime elements in R and where M (pi ) = (R/pi )ui1 \u00d7(R/p2i )ui2 \u00d7. . .\u00d7(R/pni i )uini\nis the pi -primary component of M , see [62, Satz 61.8 and Satz 61.10]. The radical of 0\nis then given by the direct product (Proposition 2.2.6(iv)) of the radicals of 0 in Rk\n(which is 0) and in M (pi ). The radical of 0 in (R/p)u1 \u00d7 (R/p2 )u2 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 (R/pn )un is\n0 \u00d7 (pR/p2 )u2 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 (pR/pn )un and the R-reduction is (R/p)u1 +u2 +...+un .\nExample 3.1.8. Let R = K[x, y] (K a field) and lets consider the R-module M =\nR2 /((x, y), (x2 y, x)). We claim that the residue class s of (x(1 \u2212 y 2 ), 0) is not 0 in M ,\nbut it is in the radical of 0. The determinant of the generators is x2 (1 \u2212 y 2 ). If R \u2212\n\u2192L\nis a homomorphism to a field, and if the determinant (in L) is 6= 0, then ML = 0. If\nthe determinant is 0, then also s = 0, so s \u2208 rad(0). Assume now that (x(1 \u2212 y 2 ), 0) =\n\n\f48\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nf (x, y) + g(x2 y, x) with f, g \u2208 R. Then f = hx and g = \u2212hy by the second column and\nthe first gives x(1 \u2212 y 2 ) = hx2 \u2212 hx2 y 2 , which has no solution.\n3.2. Surjective topology.\nDefinition 3.2.1. Let X be a scheme and let TX be the full subcategory of schemes (or\nschemes of finite type) which are affine over X. The coverings in the (affine-) surjective\ntopology on TX are the affine surjections V \u2212\n\u2192 U of finite type (over X). We denote X\nendowed with this topology by Xsurj .\nProposition 3.2.2. The surjective topology is an affine single-handed Grothendieck topology, and it is a refinement of the single-handed Zariski-topology. Every scheme-morphism\nY \u2212\u2192 X induces a site morphism Ysurj \u2212\u2192 Xsurj .\nProof. This follows immediately from the definitions. The last statement follows since\nsurjections are universally surjective.\n\u0003\nProposition 3.2.3. Let R denote a ring and let N \u2286 M denote R-modules such that\nM/N is finitely presented. Then the radical of N is the closure operation induced by the\nsurjective topology. If R is noetherian of finite dimension, then this is true for arbitrary\nsubmodules N \u2286 M .\nProof. The first statement follows from Proposition 3.1.1 and Lemma 2.4.4. The second\nstatement follows from this, from Corollary 2.4.7 and from Proposition 3.1.5.\n\u0003\nWe are going to describe the sheafification in the surjective topology, in particular for\nthe structure sheaf. We start with the separated presheaf.\nLemma 3.2.4. Let R denote a commutative ring, M a finitely generated R-module yielding the presheaf R\u2032 7\u2192 M \u2297R R\u2032 for R \u2212\u2192 R\u2032 of finite type. Then (M \u2297R R\u2032 )0 = rad(0) and\nthe R\u2032 -reduction (M \u2297R R\u2032 )1 = M \u2297R R\u2032 /(M \u2297R R\u2032 )0 is the associated separated presheaf.\nProof. This follows from Proposition 3.1.1 and Section 1.5.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 3.2.5. Let R denote a commutative ring endowed with the surjective topology.\nThen the separated presheaf O1 associated to the Zariski structure sheaf is the reduction,\ni.e. \u0393(R\u2032 , O1 ) = R\u2032 red .\nProof. This follows from Lemma 3.2.4.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 3.2.6. It follows that an element f \u2208 S, R \u2212\n\u2192 S spec-surjective, yields a global\nsection in \u0393(R, Osurj ) if and only if \u03b4(f ) = f \u2297 1 \u2212 1 \u2297 f \u2208 S\u2297R S is nilpotent. We will\ncompute the ring of global sections in Section 3.8.\n3.3. The Jacobson radical and the Jacobson topology.\nIn this section we describe briefly a variant of the radical and of the surjective topology,\nthe Jacobson radical and the Jacobson topology. The Jacobson radical of a commutative\nring R is by definition the intersection of all maximal ideals [12, Chapter 4]. Accordingly,\nwe make the following definition.\nDefinition 3.3.1. The Jacobson radical of a submodule N \u2286 M is\n\nJac(N ) = {s \u2208 M : s \u2297 1 \u2208 im(N \u2297R \u03ba(m) \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2297R \u03ba(m)) for all m maximal}.\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n49\n\nRemark 3.3.2. Note that this closure operation is not persistent with respect to all\nring homomorphisms. It is however persistent with respect to homomorphisms between\nK-algebras of finite type over a field K, in which case\nit is the same as the radical, see\nT\nthat for the\nProposition 3.3.5. For 0 \u2286 M weThave Jac(0) = m maximal mM (note\nT\nradical it is not true that rad(0) = pM ) and for N we have Jac(N ) = m maximal (N +\nmM ).\nDefinition 3.3.3. Let X be a scheme and let TX be the subcategory of schemes of finite\ntype which are affine over X. The Jacobson topology on X is the Grothendieck topology\non TX , where \u03c6 : V \u2212\n\u2192 U is a covering if \u03c6 maps onto the closed points of U . We denote\nX endowed with this topology by XJac .\nRemark 3.3.4. The Jacobson topology is a refinement of the surjective topology. For\nX = Spec R, a morphism Spec S \u2212\n\u2192 Spec R is a covering if and only if every maximal\nideal of R lies in the image. For a local ring R, the morphism Spec \u03ba(m) \u2212\n\u2192 Spec R is a\ncovering, and more generally, if I \u2286 Jac, then Spec R/I \u2212\n\u2192 Spec R is a covering in the\nJacobson topology.\nA scheme morphisms \u03c8 : Y \u2212\n\u2192 X which sends closed points to closed points induces a\nsite morphism between the Jacobson sites. This holds in particular for morphisms between\nschemes of finite type over a field [20, Corollaire 10.4.7]. The closure operation induced\nby the Jacobson topology is the Jacobson radical. Also, rad(N ) \u2286 Jac(N ).\nRecall that a commutative ring is called a Jacobson ring if every prime ideal is the\nintersection of maximal ideals [20, D\u00e9finition 10.4.1].\n\nProposition 3.3.5. For a noetherian Jacobson ring R and for finitely generated Rmodules N \u2286 M the identity Jac(N ) = rad(N ) holds.\nProof. Let R \u2212\n\u2192 S be of finite type and suppose that all maximal ideals of R are in the\nimage of Spec S \u2212\n\u2192 Spec R. We want to show that the morphism is surjective. For this\nwe may assume that R is a domain and that p = 0. The closure of the image is Spec R\ndue to the Jacobson property. Hence by the Theorem of Chevalley ([20, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me 1.8.4]\nor [12, Corollary 14.7] the image contains a non-empty set and in particular it contains 0.\nThis shows that a Jacobson cover is spec-surjective. The stated result follows then from\nRemark 3.3.4 and Proposition 3.2.3.\n\u0003\nDefinition 3.3.6. We say that a Grothendieck topology \u03c6 : Xtop \u2212\n\u2192 X on a scheme X is\nfaithful (or has the Nakayama property) if for every coherent OX -module F the following\nholds: if \u03c6\u2217 (F) = Ftop = 0, then F = 0.\nThe following Lemma is a version of the Lemma of Nakayama [12, Corollary 4.8].\n\nLemma 3.3.7. The Jacobson topology (and hence the surjective topology) on a noetherian\nscheme X is faithful.\nProof. We may assume that X = Spec R is affine. Let M be a finitely generated Rmodule and suppose that MJac = 0. This means that for every s \u2208 M there exists a\nJacobson cover Spec S \u2212\n\u2192 Spec R such that s \u2297 1 = 0 in M \u2297R S. Since M is finitely\ngenerated, there exists also such an S with M \u2297R S = 0. Since R \u2212\n\u2192 S is a Jacobson\ncover, for every maximal ideal m \u2282 R the homomorphism R/m \u2212\n\u2192 S/mS is faithful, and\nso M \u2297R R/m = M/mM = 0 for every maximal ideal. But then Mm = 0 by the Lemma of\nNakayama and so M = 0.\n\u0003\n\n\f50\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nCorollary 3.3.8. Let R denote a noetherian commutative ring and N \u2282 M a submodule\nsuch that M/N 6= 0 is finitely generated. Then Jac(N ) 6= M and rad(N ) 6= M .\nProof. This follows from Lemma 3.3.7.\n\n\u0003\n\nExample 3.3.9. Corollary 3.3.8 is not true for modules which are not finitely generated.\nIf V is a discrete valuation domain, then the quotient module Q(V )/V has the property\nthat its tensoration both with the residue class field V /mV and with Q(V ) is zero, and\nhence the tensoration with every field. Hence the radical of 0 in this module is the whole\nmodule.\nRemark 3.3.10. Let R be a principal ideal domain with infinitely many maximal ideals\n(like Z). Then by Proposition 3.3.5 for a finitely generated R-module the radical is the\nsame as the Jacobson radical. This is not true for not finitely generated modules, and\nthe Jacobson radical does not fulfill the finiteness property 2.2.14(i). For example, for the\nquotient field Q = Q(R) the radical of 0 is 0, since Q itself is a test ring, but the Jacobson\nradical of 0 is Q, since Q\u2297R R/m = 0 for every maximal ideal m. Every finitely generated\nsubmodule M \u2032 \u2286 Q is isomorphic to Rk , and there the Jacobson radical is 0.\nLemma 3.3.11. If X is a scheme of finite type over an algebraically closed field K, and\nN \u2286 M are coherent OX -modules, then s \u2208 rad(N ) if and only if this is true for all\nK-points of X.\nProof. The surjectivity of the map from the forcing scheme to X can be tested on K-points\nalone.\n\u0003\nExample 3.3.12. Let X be a scheme of finite type over C and consider the ringed\nsite Xarb given by the point set X(C) (with the complex topology) and the sheaf of all\n(not necessarily continuous) complex-valued functions on X(C). The natural mapping\nXarb \u2212\n\u2192 XZar is a morphism of ringed sites (in fact, of ringed spaces). We claim that\nthe closure operation induced by this morphism (it is not a Grothendieck topology on X)\nequals the radical. This follows from the simple fact that Y \u2212\n\u2192 X is surjective if and\nonly if Y (C) \u2212\n\u2192 X(C) is surjective, and the later is equivalent to the existence of a (not\nnecessarily continuous) section X(C) \u2212\n\u2192 Y (C). Applying this fact to the forcing schemes\n\u03c8:Y \u2212\n\u2192 X gives the claim.\nWe relate briefly our notion of the radical of a submodule with another one found in\nthe literature, see [47], [46], [54], [44] (there are also more abstract categorial definitions of\na radical). A submodule P \u2286 M of an R-module is called a prime submodule if whenever\nf s \u2208 P (where f \u2208 R, s \u2208 M ), then s \u2208 P or f M \u2286 P . Maximal submodules P \u2286 M ,\nwhich are characterized by M/P \u223c\n= R/m for some maximal ideal m, are prime. For an\ng )=T\narbitrary submodule N \u2286 M one defines the (prime)-radical by rad(N\nN \u2286P prime P .\nProposition 3.3.13. Let R denote a noetherian Jacobson ring and let M denote a finitely\ngenerated R-module, let N \u2286 M be a submodule. Then\n\\\n\nrad(N ) = Jac(N ) =\nm\n\nmaximal ideal\n\ng ) \u2286 rad(N ).\nIn particular, rad(N\n\n\\\n\n(N + mM ) =\nN \u2286P\n\nmaximal\n\ng ).\nP \u2287 rad(N\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n51\n\nProof. The first equation is Proposition 3.3.5, the second is the definition (Remark 3.3.2)\nand the forth inclusion is trivial, so we only have to look at the third equation. We\nmay assume that N = 0. Assume first that s \u2208 Jac(N ) and let P \u2286 M be a maximal\nsubmodule. Then M/P \u223c\n= R/m as R-modules for some maximal ideal m \u2282 R and so M/P\nis annihilated by m. Then mM \u2286 P and so s \u2208 P .\nSuppose now that s \u2208 P for all maximal submodules P \u2286 M , and let m be a maximal\nideal of R. Then M/mM is a finitely generated R/m = K-module, hence isomorphic\nto K n (we may assume n \u2265 1). The maximal submodules of K n are the subspaces of\ndimension n \u2212 1, and their intersection is 0. Pulling this back to M we see that mM is\nthe intersection of maximal submodules, hence s \u2208 mM .\n\u0003\n3.4. The surjective topology over a field.\nWe consider the case of a field K. Although an algebra K \u2212\n\u2192 A is spec-surjective if and\nonly if it is faithfully flat (if and only if it is 6= 0), the surjective topology is not the same\nas the faithfully flat topology. This is because the compatibility condition in the surjective\ntopology takes into account the reduction of A \u2297K A. Recall that the perfect closure of a\nfield K in characteristic zero is K itself and K \u221e = lime eK in positive characteristic, see\n\u2212\u2192\nalso Part 4.\nProposition 3.4.1. Let K denote a field endowed with the surjective topology. Then\n\u0393(Ksurj , Osurj ) = K \u221e , the perfect closure of K. If K is a perfect field, then \u0393(Ksurj , Osurj ) =\nK.\nProof. Theorem 4.3.3 below shows that an element in the perfect closure K \u221e gives an\nelement in \u0393(Ksurj , Osurj ). Therefore we may assume that K is perfect and we have to\nprove the second statement.\nLet K \u2212\n\u2192 A denote an K-algebra A 6= 0 of finite type. We may assume that A is a\ndomain, since any integral component yields a refined covering. Suppose that an element\nf \u2208 A is compatible, that is, \u03b4(f ) = f \u22971\u22121\u2297f is nilpotent in A\u2297K A. By[20, Proposition\n4.6.1] this algebra is reduced, hence \u03b4(f ) = 0 in A \u2297K A. Therefore f is also compatible\nin the faithfully flat topology, hence f \u2208 K by [49, Proposition I.2.18].\n\u0003\n3.5. Absolute stalks in the surjective topology.\nQ\n\nLet R be a ring and set rad(R) = x\u2208Spec R \u03ba(x) (we call it the radicalization of R).\n\u2192 rad(R).\nThe homomorphisms R \u2212\n\u2192 Rpx \u2212\n\u2192 \u03ba(x) \u2212\n\u2192 \u03ba(x) induce a homomorphism R \u2212\n\nProposition 3.5.1. Let R denote a commutative ring, considered in the surjective topology. Then the fixation given by R \u2212\u2192 rad(R) defines an absolute filter and the radicalization is an absolute stalk.\n\nProof. Let R \u2212\n\u2192 S in TX be given with a fixation S \u2212\n\u2192 rad(R). Then Spec S \u2212\n\u2192 Spec R\nis surjective, hence a cover. Let S \u2212\n\u2192 T be a cover in the surjective topology. We have\nto show that there exists an S-algebra homomorphism T \u2212\n\u2192 rad(R), and this can be\nchecked for every component \u03ba(x) separately. For x \u2208 Spec R the geometric fiber ring\nTx := T \u2297S \u03ba(x) 6= 0 is of finite type over \u03ba(x), hence there exists a homomorphism\nTx \u2212\n\u2192 \u03ba(x). So this quasifilter is absolute. For S \u2212\n\u2192 rad(R) the image S = im(S) \u2286\nrad(R) is also (spec-surjective and) of finite type over R, so S \u2212\n\u2192 S belongs to TX . Hence\nby Proposition 1.8.6 this is a filter. Since R \u2212\n\u2192 R[U ] is a spec-surjective covering, the\ncorresponding homomorphism OF = lim\u03bb\u2208\u039b S\u03bb \u2212\n\u2192 rad(R) is an isomorphism.\n\u0003\n\u2212\u2192\n\n\f52\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nExample 3.5.2. Let V denote a discrete valuation domain. Then by Proposition 3.4.1\nand Corollary 3.6.6 we have \u0393(V, Osurj ) = Q(V )\u221e \u2295 (V /m)\u221e =: K \u2295 k. An ideal I = (\u03c0 n )\nextends in \u0393(V, Osurj ) to the ideal K \u2295 k for n = 0 and to K \u2295 0 for n \u2265 1. The zero-ideal\nin V defines the zero ideal. The ideal 0 \u2295 k \u2286 \u0393(V, Osurj ) defines an ideal sheaf in the\nradical topology, but it is not the sheafification of an ideal in V .\nExample 3.5.3. Let V denote a discrete valuation domain with maximal ideal m = (\u03c0),\nconsider I = V \u03c0 2 \u2282 J = V \u03c0 \u2282 V . Then the radical of V \u03c0 2 inside V is V \u03c0. The inclusion\nV \u03c0 2 \u2282 V \u03c0 is as V -modules isomorphic to V \u03c0 \u2282 V . Hence the radical of V \u03c0 2 inside V \u03c0\nis just V \u03c0 2 . So the radical of a submodule depends on the surrounding module.\nThis also shows that ideals I \u2286 J with the same radical do not induce isomorphisms\nIsurj \u2212\n\u2192 Jsurj . This mapping is in our example just Osurj \u2212\n\u2192 Osurj , 1 7\u2192 \u03c0. However the\nimage ideal sheaves of Isurj and Jsurj in Osurj , that is, I surj and J surj , are the same. Also, the\nsurjective homomorphism R/I \u2212\n\u2192 R/J induces an isomorphism (O/I)surj \u2212\n\u2192 (O/J)surj .\n3.6. Constructible partitions.\nFor a discrete valuation domain V with quotient field K and residue class field k the\nring homomorphism V \u2212\n\u2192 K \u2295 k defines a surjection\nSpec K \u228e Spec k \u2212\n\u2192 Spec V ,\nwhich is neither flat nor submersive. Since (K \u2295 k) \u2297V (K \u2295 k) = K \u2295 k, every element\nin K \u2295 k is compatible and defines a global section on Spec V in the surjective topology.\nWe treat here similar constructible partitions of a scheme and the global sections in the\nsurjective topology which arise from them.\nRecall that a subset in a scheme X is called constructible if it is the finite union of\nintersections of a closed and of an open subset (see [19, \u00a70.9], [27, Exercise II. 3.18] or [12,\nSection 14.3]).\nU\n\nDefinition 3.6.1. We call a finite disjoint union X = i\u2208I Xi , where each Xi factors as\nXi \u2212\n\u2192 Wi \u2212\n\u2192 X with an open embedding Xi \u2212\n\u2192 Wi and a closed embedding Wi \u2212\n\u2192X a\nconstructible partition of X. If all Xi are affine, then we call this an affine constructible\npartition of X.\nRemark 3.6.2. We can refine every constructible partition to an affine constructible\npartition. We can further refine so that each patch Xi is integral, i.e. irreducible and\nreduced. If X is a scheme of finite type over a field, then we can get also a regular\nconstructible\npartition [20, Corollaire 6.12.5]. Note that every constructible partition\nU\n\u2192 X is a bijection, and that for every x \u2208 X the induced homomorphism of\ni\u2208I Xi \u2212\nresidue class fields is an isomorphism.\nWe introduce the constructible topology, where essentially the constructible partitions\nare the coverings.\nDefinition 3.6.3. The constructible topology on a scheme X is given by the full subcategory TX of schemes of finite type which are affine U\nover X. A morphism U \u2212\n\u2192 V in\nV\n\u2212\n\u2192\nV\nand\na\nfactorization\nT\nis\na\ncover\nif\nthere\nexists\na\nconstructible\npartition\ni\u2208I i\nUX\n\u2192U \u2212\n\u2192 V . We denote a scheme X endowed with the constructible topology by\ni\u2208I Vi \u2212\nXcons .\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n53\n\nRemark 3.6.4. The constructible topology is an affine single-handed Grothendieck topology. It is a refinement of the affine single-handed Zariski topology. Every scheme morphism\nY \u2212\n\u2192 X induces a site-morphism Ycons \u2212\n\u2192 Xcons . The surjective topology is a refinement\nof the constructible topology, so there exists a site morphism Xsurj \u2212\n\u2192 Xcons . We will see\nbelow (Theorem 3.8.2, Corollary 3.8.5) that in characteristic 0 these two topologies yield\nthe same modules of global sections.\nLemma 3.6.5. Let X denote a scheme\nand letU Xi = SpecURi , i \u2208 I, denote an affine\nU\nconstructible partition of X. Then ( i\u2208I Xi )\u00d7X ( i\u2208I Xi ) \u223c\n= ( i\u2208I Xi ), and the projections\nare isomorphisms.\nProof. Note that Z \u00d7X Z \u223c\n\u2192 X and U \u00d7X U \u223c\n= Z for a closed immersion Z \u2212\n= U for\nan open subscheme U \u2286 X. Hence this is also true for a composition U \u2212\n\u2192 Z \u2212\n\u2192 X.\nMoreover, for disjoint immersions Xi , Xj \u2212\n\u2192 X we have Xi \u00d7X Xj = \u2205. So\n(\n\n]\n\ni\u2208I\n\nXi ) \u00d7X (\n\n]\n\ni\u2208I\n\nXi ) \u223c\n=\n\n]\n\n(i,j)\u2208I\u00d7I\n\nXi \u00d7X Xj \u223c\n=\n\n]\n\ni\u2208I\n\nXi \u00d7X Xi \u223c\n=\n\n]\n\nXi .\n\ni\u2208I\n\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.6.6. Let X denote a scheme endowed with the constructible or the surjective\ntopology. Let Xi , i \u2208 I, denote a constructible partition of X, and let F denote a sheaf of\nabelian groups on Xtop , where top = surj or = cons. Then the restriction homomorphism\n\u0393(Xtop , F) \u2212\u2192 \u0393(\n\n]\n\ni\u2208I\n\nXi top , F)\n\nis an isomorphism.\nProof. This isomorphism follows from Lemma 3.6.5 and Lemma 1.6.7.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 3.6.7. Let X denote a scheme and let M be an OX -module on X. Let ji :\nXi \u2212\u2192 X, i \u2208 I, denote a constructible partition of X. Then in the constructible or in the\nsurjective topology we have an isomorphism\n\u0393(Xtop , Mtop ) \u2212\u2192\nIn particular, any (si )i\u2208I \u2208\n\nL\n\ni\u2208I\n\nM\n\n\u0393(Xi top , (ji\u2217 (M ))top ) .\n\ni\u2208I\n\n\u0393(Xi top , ji\u2217 (M )) yields a global section in \u0393(Xtop , Mtop ).\n\nProof. Due to Corollary 3.6.6 we may assume that X =\nsubschemes. Then this follows from Lemma 1.5.10\n\nU\n\ni\u2208I\n\nXi is a disjoint union of open\n\u0003\n\nProposition 3.6.8. Let X = Spec R be noetherian of finite dimension. Then the closure\noperation for finitely generated modules induced by the constructible topology is the radical.\nProof. Since the surjective topology is a refinement of the constructible topology and\nbecause of Proposition 3.2.3 we only have to show for s \u2208 rad(N ), N \u2286 M finitely\ngenerated modules, that s belongs locally to N in a constructible partition. We may\nassume that N = 0 and we may pass to a constructible partition where the patches are\naffine and integral. So we may assume that R is a noetherian domain of finite dimension.\nLet s \u2208 rad(0), so that s \u2297 1 = 0 in M \u2297R K for every field R \u2212\n\u2192 K. Then in particular\ns \u2297 1 = 0 in M \u2297R Q(R) and so s \u2297 1 = 0 in M \u2297R Rg for some 0 6= g \u2208 R. Considering the\nconstructible partition D(g) \u228e V (g) we can go on inductively.\n\u0003\n\n\f54\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nExample 3.6.9. In the case of an ideal we can give a constructible partition as predicted by Proposition 3.6.8 immediately. Let f \u2208 rad(I), I = (f1 , . . . , fn ) an ideal in a\ncommutative ring R. An affine constructible partition is given by the reductions of\nD(f1 ) \u228e (D(f2 ) \u2229 V (f1 )) \u228e . . . \u228e (D(fn ) \u2229 V (f1 , . . . , fn\u22121 )) \u228e V (f1 , . . . , fn ) .\nThe corresponding rings are Rk = (R/(f1 , . . . , fk )fk+1 )red , k = 0, . . . , n (setting fn+1 = 1).\nIn each of the Rk we clearly have f \u2208 IRk , since this extended ideal is the unit ideal for k \u2264\nn \u2212 1 and for k = n it is the zero-ideal, but also f becomes 0 in Rn = (R/(f1 , . . . , fn ))red .\nThis constructible partition is perhaps even more canonical that the forcing algebra B\nof these data. By the universal property\nof the forcing algebra (Proposition 2.1.4) there\nL\nexists a ring homomorphism B \u2212\n\u2192 nk=0 Rk . Since the global sections of this constructible\npartition are global sections in the surjective structure sheaf by Corollary 3.6.7, this also\nshows that f \u2208 I\u0393(R, Osurj ), and not only that f belongs locally to this ideal sheaf.\n3.7. Surjections and constructible partitions.\nIn this section we gather together several statements which relate surjections to constructible partitions and their finite extensions which will later on help us to compute\nmodules of global sections and cohomology in the surjective topology.\nLemma 3.7.1. Let X denote a noetherian scheme of finite dimension and let \u03c6 : Y \u2212\u2192 X\nbe a spec-surjective\nmorphism of finite type. Then there exists an affine\nconstructible\npartiU\nU\nU\ntion i\u2208I Xi \u2212\u2192 X such that there is an (X -covering) refinement i\u2208I Vi \u2212\u2192 i\u2208I Xi \u2032 \u2212\u2192\nY , where Xi \u2032 = Xi \u00d7X Y , Xi = Spec Ri and Vi = Spec Si , such that Ri \u2212\u2192 Si is a\nfinitely generated faithfully flat extension of domains. If X is a scheme over a field of\ncharacteristic 0, then one can also achieve that Si \u2297Ri Si is reduced.\nProof. We do induction on the dimension of X and we construct step by step an affine\nintegral constructible partition of X with the required properties. We pass first to an\naffine constructible partition of X such that the patches are affine and integral. We may\nalso assume that Y is affine, by replacing Y by a disjoint union of an open affine cover.\nSo we may assume that R is a domain, and that \u03c6 : Y = Spec S \u2212\n\u2192 X = Spec R is\nsurjective. By the Theorem of Chevalley [12, Corollary 14.7] the images of the irreducible\ncomponents of Spec S are constructible. In particular there exists at least one component\nsuch that its image contains an open affine subset U of Spec R. We pass to the constructible\naffine partition U \u228e Z (Z the closed component). Then, on the one hand, the morphism\n\u03c6\u22121 (U ) \u2212\n\u2192 U has a refinement by an affine integral scheme, and, on the other hand, the\nimage of the surjection \u03c6\u22121 (Z) \u2212\n\u2192 Z has lower dimension and can be treated as before.\nSo we may assume that R \u2212\n\u2192 S are both domains. By generic flatness ([20, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me\n6.9.1] or [12, Theorem 14.4]) there exists 0 6= g \u2208 R such that Rg \u2212\n\u2192 Sg is faithfully flat.\nWe pass to the corresponding constructible partition, the complement being again of lower\ndimension. So we get a partition and a refinement such that the mappings Ui \u2212\n\u2192 Vi are\nfaithfully flat morphisms between domains.\nSuppose now that R is a domain which contains a field of characteristic zero and let R \u2286\nS be a faithfully flat extension of finite type, S a domain. We consider the commutative\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n55\n\ndiagram\nR\n\n/S\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n/ SR\u2217\n\nQ(R)\n\ni1\n\ni1\n\n/ S\u2297R S\n\u000f\n/ (S\u2297R S)R\u2217\n\n= SR\u2217 \u2297Q(R) SR\u2217 .\n\nSince the characteristic is zero, Q(R) is a perfect field and so SR\u2217 \u2297Q(R) SR\u2217 is reduced\nby[20, Proposition 4.6.1]. If a \u2286 S\u2297R S is the nilradical, then it maps to 0 in (S\u2297R S)R\u2217 ,\nand so there exists g \u2208 R\u2217 with ga = 0. Then (S\u2297R S)g = Sg \u2297Rg Sg is reduced and we\nlook at the partition X = D(g) \u228e V (g) and use the induction hypothesis on V (g).\n\u0003\nLemma 3.7.2. Let Y \u2212\u2192 X be a surjection of finite type between noetherian schemes of\nfinite dimension. Then there exists an affine integral constructible partition Xi \u2212\u2192 X and\nfinite surjective morphisms Xi\u2032 \u2212\u2192 Xi , where Xi\u2032 are also affine and integral, and sections\nXi\u2032 \u2212\u2192 Y .\n\nProof. The statement is stable under refining by constructible partitions, so we may assume that X = Spec R, where R is a noetherian domain with quotient field Q(R). For\na closed point x \u2208 YQ(R) the extension Q(R) \u2286 k(x) is of finite type and hence finite.\nLet R \u2286 R\u2032 \u2282 k(x) be finite such that Q(R\u2032 ) = k(x). Then there exists an open subset\nD(h) \u2286 Spec R\u2032 such that i : x = Spec(k(x)) \u2212\n\u2192 Y extends to D(h) \u2212\n\u2192 Y . For this reduce\nto Y = Spec A affine and find a common denominator h for the images i\u2217 (Tj ) = qj \u2208 k(x),\nwhere the Tj are R\u2032 -algebra generators of A. There exists also \u2205 =\n6 D(g) \u2286 X such that\nthe preimage of D(g) lies inside D(h) \u2286 Spec R\u2032 . Therefore for D(g) \u2286 X we have a\nfinite extension X \u2032 = Spec R\u2032 |D(g) and a section X \u2032 \u2212\n\u2192 Y . We go on on V (g) \u2282 X\ninductively.\n\u0003\nLemma 3.7.3. Let \u03c6 : Y \u2212\u2192 X be a finite surjective morphism between noetherian\nschemes, where X is integral of finite dimension. Then there exists an affine integral\nconstructible partition Xi \u2212\u2192 X such that Yi = Xi \u00d7X Y is a disjoint union of irreducible\nschemes.\nProof. Let Zj , j \u2208 J, be the irreducible components of Y . The union of the intersections\nZj \u2229 Zj \u2032 (j 6= j \u2032 ) has smaller dimension than dim(X), so its image in X is a proper closed\nsubset V \u2282 X. For an open non-empty affine subset U \u2286 X \u2212 V in its complement the\ncomponents Uj = \u03c6\u22121 (U ) \u2229 Zj are disjoint. So we get inductively a constructible partition\nof X with the required properties.\n\u0003\n3.8. Global sections in the surjective topology.\nWe characterize now the ring of global sections in the constructible topology and in the\nsurjective topology. We first describe \u0393(Xcons , Ocons ) as a subring of the radicalization of\nR.\nProposition 3.8.1. Let R denote a noetherian ring, and let X = Spec R be endowed with\nthe constructive topology. Then\n\u0393(Xcons , Ocons ) ={f \u2208\n\nY\n\n\u03ba(x) : there exists an affine constructible partition\n\nx\u2208X\n\nR \u2212\u2192\n\nM\ni\u2208I\n\nRi and fi \u2208 Ri such that fi (x) = f (x) in \u03ba(x)} .\n\n\f56\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nProof. We have natural homomorphisms\n\u0393(Xcons , Ocons ) \u2212\u2192 \u0393(Xsurj , Osurj ) \u2212\u2192\n\nY\n\n\u03ba(x)\n\nx\u2208X\n\nby Proposition 3.5.1. Since the radicalization is the absolute stalk, the second homomorphism is injective by Lemma 1.9.5. The first homomorphism is induced by the site\nmorphism Xsurj \u2212\n\u2192 Xcons . This homomorphism\nis also injective: if f \u2208 \u0393(Xcons , Ocons ) is\nU\nrepresented by fi \u2208 \u0393(Xi , Oi ), X = i\u2208I Xi an affine integral constructible partition and\nmaps to 0 in \u0393(Xsurj , Osurj ), then there exists a surjection Y \u2212\n\u2192 X such that f becomes\n0. But then also the pull-backs of fi to Xi \u00d7X Y are 0 for all i \u2208 I. This implies, since\nthe Xi are integral, that fi = 0 and so f = 0 in \u0393(Xcons , Ocons ).\nThe image of \u0393(Xcons , Ocons ) inside the absolute stalk is the described subring: an\nelement f \u2208 \u0393(Xcons , Ocons ) is represented by fi \u2208 Ri , where Xi = Spec Ri is an affine\nconstructible partition of X, and every such tuple yields a global element.\n\u0003\nTheorem 3.8.2. Let R denote a noetherian ring of finite dimension endowed with the\nsurjective topology, X = Spec R. Suppose that R contains a field of characteristic zero.\nThen\n\u0393(Xsurj , Osurj ) = \u0393(Xcons , Ocons ) .\n\nProof. We have proven already in Proposition 3.8.1 that the natural homomorphism\n\u0393(Xcons , Ocons ) \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(Xsurj , Osurj ) is injective. For the surjectivity suppose that f \u2208\n\u0393(X, Osurj ) is represented by a compatible element f \u2208 S, R \u2212\n\u2192 S being spec-surjective.\nWe have to construct a constructible partition of X such thatUf comes from there. By\nLemma 3.7.1 there exists an\naffine constructible partition X = i\u2208I Xi and affine schemes\nU\nVi \u2212\n\u2192 Xi \u00d7X Y such that Vi \u2212\n\u2192Y \u2212\n\u2192 X is a surjection, that Vi \u2212\n\u2192 Xi are faithfully flat\nmorphisms of finite type between\nintegral\naffine\nschemes\nand\nthat\nV\ni \u00d7Xi Vi is reduced. We\nU\ncan pass to the refinement Vi and may assume that f is given as fi \u2208 Si , Vi = Spec Si ,\nwhich are compatible over Xi . We can treat the fi separately.\nThe compatibility of fi \u2208 Si means that fi \u2297 1 \u2212 1 \u2297 fi is nilpotent by Corollary 3.2.5.\nHence this difference is 0, since Si \u2297Ri Si is reduced. But this means that fi is also\ncompatible in the faithfully flat topology; hence fi \u2208 Ri [49, Proposition I.2.18], where\nXi = Spec Ri .\n\u0003\nRemark 3.8.3. Theorem 3.8.2 and Proposition 3.8.1 show that every element f \u2208\n\u0393(Xsurj , Osurj ) has at every point x \u2208 X a well-defined value f (x) \u2208 \u03ba(x), not only in\n\u03ba(x). This is also clear considering Spec \u03ba(x) \u2212\n\u2192 X. This scheme morphism defines a site\nmorphism (Spec \u03ba(x))surj \u2212\n\u2192 Xsurj and therefore a homomorphism of the rings of global\nsections, \u0393(X, Osurj ) \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(Spec \u03ba(x), Osurj ) = \u03ba(x) (in characteristic zero). This reasoning shows also that in positive characteristic every global function over Xsurj has for every\npoint x a well-defined value in \u03ba(x)\u221e .\nWe extend some of the results in this section to coherent modules.\nLemma 3.8.4. Let X be a noetherian scheme of finite dimensionUand let M be a coherent\nsheaf on X. Then there exists an affine constructible partition i\u2208I Xi \u2212\u2192 X such that\nji \u2217 (M ) is free, where ji : Xi \u2212\u2192 X is the natural embedding.\n\nProof. We may assume that X = Spec R is affine and integral. Then we have an isomorphism M \u2297R Q(R) \u223c\n= Q(R)n . Therefore Mg \u223c\n= Rgn for some 0 6= g \u2208 R and the statement\nis true on U = D(g). Then we may go on on V (g) inductively.\n\u0003\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n57\n\nCorollary 3.8.5. Let X be a noetherian scheme of finite dimension over a field of characteristic 0 and let M be a coherent sheaf on X. Then the global sections in \u0393(Xsurj , Msurj )\nare constructible\nsections, i.e. they are of the form s = (si )i\u2208I , si \u2208 \u0393(Xi , ji\u2217 (M )), where\nU\nX = i\u2208I Xi is an affine constructible partition.\nU\n\nProof. We may assumeL\nby Lemma 3.8.4 that XL= Xi is such that all ji\u2217 (M ) are free.\nni\nThen \u0393(Xsurj , Msurj ) = i\u2208I \u0393(Xi surj , Mi surj ) = i\u2208I \u0393(Xi surj , Osurj\n) (by Corollary 3.6.7)\nand the result follows from Theorem 3.8.2.\n\u0003\n3.9. Exactness in the surjective topology.\nWe characterize when a complex of modules is exact in the surjective topology. First\nexamples were already given in Proposition 2.7.6.\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n\nTheorem 3.9.1. Let R denote a commutative ring and let N \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 L denote a\ncomplex of finitely generated R-modules. Then the following are equivalent (suppose in the\nlast statement that R is noetherian of finite dimension and contains a field of characteristic\n0).\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n\n(i) The complex of sheaves N surj \u2212\u2192 M surj \u2212\u2192 Lsurj on (Spec R)surj is exact (where\nTR contains all R-algebras or all R-algebras of finite type).\n\u03b1\n\n(ii) For every ring homomorphism R \u2212\u2192 R\u2032 (of finite type), the complex N \u2297R R\u2032 \u2212\u2192\n\u03b2\n\nM \u2297R R\u2032 \u2212\u2192 L \u2297R R\u2032 is such that the kernel lies inside the radical of the image.\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b1\n\n(iii) The complex N \u2297R rad(R) \u2212\u2192 M \u2297R rad(R) \u2212\u2192 L \u2297R rad(R) of rad(R)-modules\nis exact.\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b1\n\n(iv) For every homomorphism R \u2212\u2192 K to a field the complex N \u2297R K \u2212\u2192 M \u2297R K \u2212\u2192\nL \u2297R K of K-vector spaces is exact.\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n\n(v) The complex \u0393(R\u2032 , N top ) \u2212\u2192 \u0393(R\u2032 , M top ) \u2212\u2192 \u0393(R\u2032 , Ltop ) of global sections is exact\nfor all ring homomorphism R \u2212\u2192 R\u2032 of finite type.\n\nProof. The conditions (i), (ii) and (iv) are equivalent by Corollary 2.7.3. (i) \u21d2 (iii) follows\nfrom Corollary 1.8.5, Lemma 1.10.3 and Proposition 3.5.1. (iii) \u21d2 (iv). A homomorphism\nR\u2212\n\u2192 K factors as R \u2212\n\u2192 \u03ba(x) \u2212\n\u2192 K, where x \u2208 Spec R. By restricting the exactness of\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u2192 M \u2297R \u03ba(x) \u2212\n\u2192 L \u2297R \u03ba(x)\n(iii) to the component given by x, it follows that N \u2297R \u03ba(x) \u2212\nis exact. This is then also true if we replace \u03ba(x) by \u03ba(x) and then by K.\n(iv) \u21d2 (v). The condition in (iv) holds also for R\u2032 , and (M \u2297R R\u2032 )top = (Mtop )|X \u2032\n\u2032\non Xsurj\n(X \u2032 = Spec R\u2032 ) by Corollary 1.5.6, hence we may assume that R = R\u2032 . Let\ns \u2208 \u0393(Xsurj , Mtop ) mapping to 0 in \u0393(Xsurj , Ltop ).\nBy Corollary 3.8.5 we may assume that s is represented by si \u2208 M \u2297R Ri , where ji : Xi =\nSpec Ri \u2212\n\u2192 X is an affine integral constructible partition. We have\nto find a global section\nL\n\u2217\nt \u2208 \u0393(Xsurj , Nsurj ) which maps to s. Since\n\u0393(X\n,\nN\n)\n=\nsurj\nsurj\ni\u2208I \u0393(Xi surj , ji (N )surj )\nU\n(Corollary 3.6.7) we may assume that X = i\u2208I Xi is the disjoint union of open subschemes\nand we can treat the components separately; hence we skip the index i. Since s maps to\n0, there exist spec-surjective homomorphisms R \u2212\n\u2192 S such that \u03b2(s) \u2297 1 = 0 in L\u2297R S.\nThen by Proposition 3.1.1 for every field R \u2212\n\u2192 K we have \u03b2(s) \u2297 1 = 0 in L\u2297R K, so in\nparticular for the quotient field Q(R).\n\n\f58\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nBy condition (iv) there exists an element t \u2208 N \u2297R Q(R) mapping to s, and this is then\nalso true for t \u2208 N \u2297R Rg , 0 6= g \u2208 R. Therefore s comes from the left on the open set\nD(g) \u2286 X and we pass to the constructible partition D(g) \u228e V (g). The R/(g)-complex\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b1\n\nN \u2297R (R/(g)) \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2297R (R/(g)) \u2212\n\u2192 L \u2297R (R/(g)) fulfills also property (iv), so we can\nconstruct inductively a constructible partition Xj \u2212\n\u2192 X such that s comes from an element\ntj \u2208 N \u2297R Rj . Such a tuple is compatible and defines a global section in \u0393(Xsurj , Nsurj ) by\nCorollary 3.6.7.\n(v) \u21d2 (i) is trivial, since a global solution is also a local solution.\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.9.2. Let R denote a commutative ring of finite dimension containing a field\nof characteristic 0, X = Spec R. Let M \u2212\u2192 L \u2212\u2192 0 be an exact sequence of finitely\ngenerated R-modules. Then also \u0393(Xsurj , Msurj ) \u2212\u2192 \u0393(Xsurj , Lsurj ) is surjective.\nProof. The complex of sheaves Msurj \u2212\n\u2192 Lsurj \u2212\n\u2192 0 is exact, hence by Theorem 3.9.1(v)\nalso \u0393(Xsurj , Msurj ) \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(Xsurj , Lsurj ) \u2212\n\u2192 0 is exact.\n\u0003\nExample 3.9.3. Let R be a commutative ring with reduction Rred . Then the complex of\nR-modules 0 \u2212\n\u2192R\u2212\n\u2192 Rred is exact only when R is reduced. But tensoring with \u03ba(p) (and\nso with every field) yields always an exact complex, since Rred \u2297R R/p = R/nR \u2297R R/q =\nR/q, where nR is the nilradical. So this complex is exact in the surjective topology.\nRemark 3.9.4. Using the characterization in Theorem 3.9.1(ii) one can show that for a\nring of finite type over a field K the exactness in the surjective topology is equivalent to\nthe exactness after every ring homomorphism R \u2212\n\u2192 K.\nProposition 3.9.5. Let R be a noetherian ring of finite dimension over a field of characteristic zero and let N \u2286 M be finitely generated R-modules. Let Nsurj \u2212\u2192 N surj \u2286\nMsurj be the surjection of sheaves in the surjective topology on X = Spec R. Then also\n\u0393(Xsurj , Nsurj ) \u2212\u2192 \u0393(Xsurj , N surj ) is surjective.\n\nProof. Let s \u2208 \u0393(Xsurj , N surj ) \u2286 \u0393(Xsurj , Msurj ). Recall that N surj is the image sheaf of\nNsurj \u2212\n\u2192 Msurj , so s comes locally from Nsurj . Due to Corollary 3.8.5 we can represent s\n\u2192 X is an affine\nby si \u2208 \u0393(Xi , ji\u2217 (M )) = M \u2297R Ri , (ji\u2217 is the Zariski pull-back), where Xi \u2212\npartition of X. As the global sections of Nsurj also respect this partition we may assume\nthat s \u2208 M . Since s \u2208 \u0393(Xsurj , N surj ), we know by Proposition 3.6.8 that there exists a\nconstructible partition Xi \u2212\n\u2192 X and sections ti \u2208 \u0393(Xi , Nsurj ) mapping to the restrictions\nof s. Again by Corollary 3.8.5 this represents a global element t \u2208 \u0393(X, Nsurj ) mapping to\ns.\n\u0003\nFor free modules the exactness in the surjective topology is quite a strong condition.\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n\nLemma 3.9.6. Let Ra \u2212\u2192 Rb \u2212\u2192 Rc be complex of free R-modules, so that \u03b1 and \u03b2 are\ngiven by matrices. Let Ji (\u03b1) denote the ith minor ideal, i.e. the ideal generated by all\ndeterminants of the i \u00d7 i-submatrices of \u03b1. Then the following are equivalent.\nP\n(i) We have i+j=b Ji (\u03b1)Jj (\u03b2) = (1).\n(ii) For every ring homomorphism R \u2212\u2192 R\u2032 the tensored complex is exact.\n(iii) The complex is exact in the surjective topology.\nProof. (i) \u21d2 (ii). Since the minor condition is stable under arbitrary base change, we may\nassume that R\u2032 = R and that R is local. For a local ring the condition means that there\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n59\n\nexists an invertible submatrix of \u03b1 of seize i and an invertible submatrix of \u03b2 of seize j\nwith i + j = b. After a base change in the first two modules we may assume that the first\nj columns in the matrix \u03b1 are the first j unit vectors. It follows that the first j columns\nof \u03b2 must be zero. Therefore the remaining b \u2212 j = i columns of \u03b2 contain an invertible\ni \u00d7 i-submatrix. It follows that the first j unit vectors generate exactly the kernel of \u03b2,\nand this is also the image of \u03b1.\nThe\nimplication (ii) \u21d2 (iii) is trivial. (iii) \u21d2 (i). If the minor condition is not fulfilled,\nP\n\u2192K\nthen i+j=b Ji (\u03b1)Jj (\u03b2) is contained in a maximal ideal and so there exists a field R \u2212\nP\nsuch that i+j=b Ji (\u03b1)Jj (\u03b2) = 0. Let i = rk(\u03b1) over K. Then rk(\u03b2) < b \u2212 i and\ndim(kern \u03b2) = b \u2212 dim(im \u03b2) > b \u2212 (b \u2212 i) = i, so the tensorized complex is not exact. \u0003\nExample 3.9.7. Let f \u2208 R be a non-zero divisor and a non unit. Then the sequence\n0\n\nf\n\nR\u2212\n\u2192R\u2212\n\u2192 R is exact, but not exact in the surjective topology. For a maximal ideal m\n0\n\ncontaining f the tensoration with K = R/m yields 0 \u2212\n\u2192K\u2212\n\u2192 K.\n\nRemark 3.9.8. Lemma 3.9.6 says in particular that for given \u03b1 : Ra \u2212\n\u2192 Rb it can be\nchecked in the surjective topology (i.e. after tensoration with fields alone) whether it is\nan isomorphism or not. This statement can be found for a homomorphism between flat\nmodules over a noetherian ring in [28].\nFor a homomorphism \u03b1 between free modules (or for a matrix) we call the maximum i\nsuch that Ji (\u03b1) contains a non zero divisor its rank (cf.

(i) \u21d4 (iii). Note that rk + rk\u22121 = bk and that Ji (\u03b1k ) 6= (1) for i > rk . Then the\nminor condition of Lemma 3.9.6 for the kth place reduces to Jrk (\u03b1k )Jrk\u22121 (\u03b1k\u22121 ) = (1).\nHence this equivalence follows by induction on k.\n(ii) \u21d2 (iii) is contained in Theorem 3.9.1, so assume that (i) holds. Since the minor\ncondition respects base changes, we may assume that R = R\u2032 and that R is local. Since\nJr0 (\u03b10 ) = (1) and r0 = b0 the homomorphism \u03b11 is surjective. Then the kernel kern(\u03b10 )\nis free of rank b1 \u2212 b0 and the homomorphism Rb2 \u2212\n\u2192 Rb1 \u2212b0 \u223c\n= kern(\u03b10 ) \u2286 Rb1 fulfills also\nthe minor condition. So we can go on inductively.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.9.10. The Buchsbaum-Eisenbud criterion asserts that if in the situation of\nCorollary 3.9.9 (with also a 0 on the left) the so-called standard condition on depth\nis fulfilled, namely that depth(Jrk (\u03b1k )) \u2265 k + 1 , then the complex itself is exact. A\nvariant of Hochster and Huneke [38, Theorem 10.3] says that if the height condition\nht(Jrk (\u03b1k )) \u2265 k + 1 is true, then the complex has phantom homology.\n3.10. Cohomology in the surjective topology.\nIn this section we show that the first cohomology of coherent modules in the constructible and in the surjective topology is zero.\n\n\f60\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nProposition 3.10.1. Let X\ndenote a scheme endowed with the constructible or the surU\n\u2032\njective topology. Let X = i\u2208I Xi \u2212\u2192 X denote a constructible partition. Let P denote\na presheaf of abelian groups. Then the \u010cech cohomology groups for this covering are\n\u021e 0 (X \u2032 \u2212\u2192 X, P) = \u0393(X \u2032 , P) and \u021e k (X \u2032 \u2212\u2192 X, P) = 0 for k \u2265 1.\nProof. This follows from Lemma 3.6.5 and Lemma 1.11.1.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe first cohomology for coherent sheaves vanishes also in the surjective topology, but\nthe proof is more involved. We restrict to characteristic zero.\nTheorem 3.10.2. Let X be a noetherian scheme of finite dimension over a field of characteristic 0. Then \u021e 1 (Xsurj , Osurj ) = 0.\nProof. Let Y \u2212\n\u2192 X be a surjection of finite type. We have to show that a \u010cech cocycle\nrepresented by this covering is 0. To show this we may use refinements Z \u2212\n\u2192 Y , where\nZ \u2212\n\u2192 X is also a covering. Let Xi \u2212\n\u2192 X be a constructible partition and set Yi =\nXi \u00d7X Y \u2212\n\u2192 Xi . The first \u010cech cohomology (with respect to the given cover) is given as\nthe homology of the first row in the following commutative diagram\n\u0393(Y, Osurj )\n\n/ \u0393(Y \u00d7X Y, Osurj )\n\n/ \u0393(Y \u00d7X Y \u00d7X Y, Osurj )\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\nU\n/ \u0393( (Yi \u00d7X Yi ), Osurj )\ni\n\n\u000f\nU\n/ \u0393( (Yi \u00d7X Yi \u00d7X Yi ), Osurj )\ni\ni\n\nU\n\n\u0393( Yi , Osurj )\nL\n\n\u000f\n\ni \u0393(Yi , Osurj )\n\n/\n\nL\n\ni \u0393(Yi\n\n\u000f\n\n\u00d7Xi Yi , Osurj )\n/\n\nL\n\ni \u0393(Yi\n\n\u000f\n\n\u00d7Xi Yi \u00d7Xi Yi , Osurj ),\n\nwhere the down-arrows are isomorphisms by Corollaries 3.6.6 and 3.6.7. An element\ns \u2208 \u0393((Y \u00d7X Y )surj , Osurj ) is a cocycle if and only if for every i its component si \u2208\n\u0393((Yi \u00d7Xi Yi )surj , Osurj ) is a cocycle. We have to show that s comes after a refinement\nZ\u2212\n\u2192 Y from the left, and for this we can look at the components separately. Therefore\nwe will repeatedly simplify the situation by using a constructible partition of X.\nBy Lemma 3.7.2 and by the preceding consideration we may assume that Y \u2212\n\u2192 X is\na finite surjective morphism between noetherian affine integral schemes. We may also\nassume by Lemma 3.7.1 that this morphism is flat. Suppose that s \u2208 \u0393(Y \u00d7X Y, Osurj )\nmaps to\n0 on the right. This s is by Theorem 3.8.2 represented by sj \u2208 \u0393(Zj , O), j \u2208 J,\nU\nwhere j\u2208J Zj \u2212\n\u2192 Y \u00d7X Y is a constructible partition into affine integral schemes.\nBy Lemma 3.7.3 we find a constructible partition of X such that we may assume that all\nirreducible components Vi , i \u2208 I, of Y \u00d7X Y are disjoint. We may furthermore assume by\nrefining that the partition Zj of Y \u00d7X Y (where the cocycle s = sj lives) is a subpartition\nof the disjoint irreducible components. So we write the cocycle as sij \u2208 \u0393(Zij , O), where\nZij \u2212\n\u2192 Vi , j \u2208 Ji , are constructible partitions. Let Wi = Ziji be the open subsets of the\ncomponents Vi where the generic elements siji \u2208 \u0393(Wi , O) live. Then the images of Vi \u2212Wi\nare closed and their union over i \u2208 I is a closed subset A of X of smaller dimension. We\nconsider the constructible partition X = U \u228eA. The generic tuple siji , i \u2208 I, is represented\nby the element\n(siji )i\u2208I \u2208 \u0393(\n\n]\n\ni\u2208I\n\nVi \u2229 (p\u22121 (U ) \u00d7U p\u22121 (U )), O) = \u0393(p\u22121 (U ) \u00d7U p\u22121 (U ), O) .\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n61\n\nNote that Vi \u2229 (p\u22121 (U ) \u00d7U p\u22121 (U )) \u2286 Wi , so we can consider the restriction of siji . If\nwe set U = Spec R (possibly after replacing U by a smaller affine non-empty subset) and\np\u22121 (U ) = Spec B, then we have \u0393(p\u22121 (U ) \u00d7U p\u22121 (U ), O) = B\u2297R B and we may consider\nthe generic part of the cocycle in this tensor product.\nSo we may assume now that R is a noetherian domain, R \u2286 B is finite and flat and that\nwe have an element s \u2208 B\u2297R B which maps to 0 in \u0393((Y \u00d7X Y \u00d7X Y )surj , Osurj ). With a\nsimilar\nargument as in the proof of Lemma 3.7.1 we find an affine constructible partition\nU\nof Xi \u2212\n\u2192 X such that the Yi \u00d7Xi Yi \u00d7Xi Yi are reduced. But then the image of s is not\nonly 0 in the surjective topology, but already in Bi \u2297Ri Bi \u2297Ri Bi . Then s comes from the\nleft by the exactness of the \u010cech complex in the flat topology.\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.10.3. Let X be a noetherian scheme of finite dimension over a field of\ncharacteristic 0 endowed with the surjective topology. Let M be a coherent module on X\nwith corresponding module Msurj in the surjective topology. Then \u021e 1 (X, Msurj ) = 0 and\nH 1 (X, Msurj ) = 0.\nProof. The vanishing of the first cohomology follows from the vanishing of the \u010cech cohomology. By Lemma 3.8.4 we may pass to a constructible partition ji : Xi \u2212\n\u2192 X such\n\u0003\nthat ji\u2217 (M ) is finitely generated and free. Then this follows from Theorem 3.10.2.\nCorollary 3.10.4. Let X = Spec R be an affine noetherian scheme of finite dimension\nover a field of characteristic 0. Let 0 \u2212\u2192 N \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 L \u2212\u2192 0 be a short exact sequence\nof finitely generated R-modules with corresponding short exact sequence of sheaves 0 \u2212\u2192\nkern = N surj \u2212\u2192 Msurj \u2212\u2192 Lsurj \u2212\u2192 0 on Xsurj . Then H 1 (Xsurj , kern) = 0. In the situation\nof Proposition 2.8.1 we get H 1 (Xsurj , Syz) = 0.\nProof. The exactness of Msurj \u2212\n\u2192 Lsurj \u2212\n\u2192 0 induces by Corollary 3.9.2 a global surjection\n\u0393(Xsurj , Msurj ) \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(Xsurj , Lsurj ). Since H 1 (Xsurj , Msurj ) = 0 by Corollary 3.10.3, it follows\nH 1 (Xsurj , kern) = 0 by the long exact sequence of cohomology.\nFor the second statement let Rn \u2212\n\u2192N \u2212\n\u2192 0 be given. By Corollary 3.9.2 and Proposin )\u2212\ntion 3.9.5 we get a surjection \u0393(Xsurj , Osurj\n\u2192\u0393(Xsurj , Nsurj )\u2212\u2192\u0393(Xsurj , N surj ). Hence the\n1\nn\nresult follows from H (Xsurj , Osurj ) = 0.\n\u0003\n4. Frobenius topology and Frobenius closure\n4.1. Frobenius morphism and Frobenius closure.\nLet R denote a ring containing a field of positive characteristic p. Then the Frobenius\nhomomorphism is given by F : R \u2212\n\u2192 R, f 7\u2192 f p . This is a ring homomorphism due to\n(f + g)p = f p + gp and so are its iterations F e : R \u2212\n\u2192 R, f 7\u2192 f q , where q = pe . The e-th\nFrobenius power of an ideal I \u2286 R is the extended ideal\nwhere I = (f1 , . . . , fn ).\n\nI [q] = F e (I) = {f q : f \u2208 I} = (f1q , . . . , fnq ) ,\n\nDefinition 4.1.1. The Frobenius closure of an ideal I \u2286 R in a commutative ring containing a field of positive characteristic p is given as\nI F = {f \u2208 R : \u2203e \u2208 N such that f q \u2208 I [q] , q = pe } .\n\nFor a ring R of positive characteristic and an R-module M we denote eM = M \u2297R eR,\nwhere eR is the ring R, but considered as an R-algebra via the e-th iteration of the\n\n\f62\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nFrobenius homomorphism. For submodules N \u2286 M we get eR-homomorphisms eN \u2212\n\u2192 eM ,\nand the Frobenius closure of a submodule N \u2286 M is defined by\nN F = {s \u2208 M : \u2203e such that s \u2297 1 \u2208 im(eN \u2212\n\u2192 eM )} .\n\nWe consider the category of schemes of positive characteristic p, that is, the category of\nschemes X with a (unique) structure morphism X \u2212\n\u2192 Spec Z/(p). The absolute Frobenius\nmorphism is the identity on the underlying set X and on every open affine subset Spec R =\nU \u2286 X it is the scheme morphism given by the Frobenius homomorphism. We denote the\nFrobenius by 1 X \u2212\n\u2192 X and the e-th iteration by eX \u2212\n\u2192 X.\nDefinition 4.1.2. A (finite) morphism V \u2212\n\u2192 U of finite type of schemes of positive\ncharacteristic p is called a (finite) Frobenius cover if there exists e \u2208 N and a factorization\neU \u2212\n\u2192V \u2212\n\u2192 U such that e U \u2212\n\u2192 V is surjective and the composition is an iteration of an\nabsolute Frobenius morphism.\nLemma 4.1.3. The composition of two (finite) Frobenius covers and an arbitrary base\nchange of a (finite) Frobenius cover is again a (finite) Frobenius cover.\nProof. Let eU \u2212\n\u2192V \u2212\n\u2192 U and \u1ebdV \u2212\n\u2192W \u2212\n\u2192 V be given. Then we also have e+\u1ebdU \u2212\n\u2192 \u1ebdV\ne+\u1ebd\n\u1ebd\nand so\nU \u2212\n\u2192 V \u2212\n\u2192W \u2212\n\u2192V \u2212\n\u2192 U . If Y \u2212\n\u2192 X is a base change, then the pull-back of\neU \u2212\n\u2192V \u2212\n\u2192 U and the universal property of the product give eY \u00d7eX eU \u2212\n\u2192 Y \u00d7X eU \u2212\n\u2192\nY \u00d7X V \u2212\n\u2192 Y \u00d7X U .\n\u0003\nLemma 4.1.4. Let X denote a scheme in positive characteristic, e \u2208 N. Then the projections eX \u00d7X eX \u2212\u2192 eX induce (identical) isomorphisms in the reductions, (eX \u00d7X eX)red \u223c\n=\n(eX)red . The same is true for a finite Frobenius cover Y \u2212\u2192 X, and the diagonal Y \u2212\u2192\nY \u00d7X Y is also a finite Frobenius cover.\n\u25b3\n\nProof. We may assume that X = Spec R is affine. We have the diagonal mapping eX \u2212\n\u2192\neX\n\np1\n\ni1\n\n\u25b3\u2217\n\n\u00d7X eX \u2212\n\u2192 eX resp. eR \u2212\n\u2192 eR\u2297R eR \u2212\n\u2192 eR, f 7\u2192 f \u2297 1, a \u2297 b 7\u2192 ab. The composition is\nof course the identity. The other composition sends a \u2297 b 7\u2192 ab \u2297 1. We have (a \u2297 b)q =\naq \u2297 bq = aq bq \u2297 1, because bq \u2208 R. Hence a \u2297 b \u2212 ab \u2297 1 is nilpotent in eR\u2297R eR, and so\nafter reduction we have an isomorphism. The two projections yield the same isomorphism,\nbecause the inverse is \u25b3red in both cases.\nIf S is finite over R with a spec-surjective homomorphism S \u2212\n\u2192 eR, then again we look\n\u25b3\u2217\n\ni1\n\nat S\u2297R S \u2212\n\u2192S\u2212\n\u2192 S\u2297R S. The difference between a \u2297 b and ab \u2297 1 maps to a nilpotent\nelement under the finite spec-surjective homomorphism S\u2297R S \u2212\n\u2192 eR\u2297R eR. Since this\nhomomorphism is spec-surjective, the difference itself must be nilpotent.\n\u25b3\u2217\n\ni1\n\nFor the last statement we look at S\u2297R S \u2212\n\u2192S\u2212\n\u2192 S\u2297R S \u2212\n\u2192 e(S\u2297R S). The composition\nq\nq\nq\nmaps a\u2297b 7\u2192 a b \u22971, and for e big enough this equals (a\u2297b) , as the difference a\u2297b\u2212ab\u22971\nis nilpotent.\n\u0003\n4.2. Frobenius topology.\nDefinition 4.2.1. The Frobenius topology on a scheme X of characteristic p is given\nby schemes over X where the morphisms V \u2212\n\u2192 U (including the structural morphisms\nV \u2212\n\u2192 X) are finite Frobenius covers. We denote X endowed with the Frobenius topology\nby Xfrob .\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n63\n\nProposition 4.2.2. The Frobenius topology is an affine single-handed covering Grothendieck topology. Every scheme morphism Y \u2212\u2192 X of schemes over Spec Z/(p) yields a site\nmorphism Yfrob \u2212\u2192 Xfrob .\nProof. This follows from Lemma 4.1.3.\n\n\u0003\n\nProposition 4.2.3. The Frobenius closure is the closure operation induced by the Frobenius topology.\nProof. This follows from the Definitions 4.1.1 and 4.2.1 and from Lemma 2.4.4. Just\nnote that if s \u2297 1 \u2208 im(N \u2297R eR \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2297R eR), then there exists also a finite subalgebra\ne\nR\u2212\n\u2192S\u2212\n\u2192 R such that s \u2297 1 \u2208 im(N \u2297R S \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2297R S).\n\u0003\nProposition 4.2.4. Let R denote a ring containing a field of positive characteristic p.\nThen the following are equivalent.\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv)\n\nR is F -pure, that is, the Frobenius homomorphism is a pure ring homomorphism.\nThe Frobenius topology on Spec R is pure.\nThe Frobenius closure is trivial on arbitrary submodules.\nIf R is a local Gorenstein ring, then this is also equivalent with the property that\nthe Frobenius closure is trivial on ideals.\n\nProof. The equivalence (i) \u21d4 (ii) follows immediately from Definition 4.2.1 of the Frobenius topology and from Definition 2.5.1. The equivalence of (ii) and (iii) follows from\nProposition 2.5.3. (iii) implies (iv). Under the Gorenstein hypothesis (iv) implies (iii) by\n[14, Corollary 1.5].\n\u0003\nF -pure rings have found a great deal of interest, including their classification in low\ndimension, see e.g. [37], [15], [14], [48], [25], [26].\n4.3. Rings of global sections in the Frobenius topology.\nThe prefect closure of a ring R over a field of positive characteristic p is given as the\ncolimit R\u221e = lime\u2208N eR, see [63]. For an R-module M we have lim eM = lim M \u2297R eR =\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\nM \u2297R R\u221e . We will see that this is also the module of global sections of Mfrob in the\nFrobenius topology.\nProposition 4.3.1. Let R\u221e be the perfect closure of R. The fixation given by R\u221e defines\nan absolute filter with absolute stalk R\u221e .\nProof. If R \u2212\n\u2192 S is a Frobenius cover and S \u2212\n\u2192 R\u221e an R-algebra homomorphism, then\nthis factors through some eR. For a Frobenius cover S \u2212\n\u2192 T over R and a given fixation\nS \u2212\n\u2192 eR \u2212\n\u2192 R\u221e there exists by definition T \u2212\n\u2192 \u1ebdS \u2212\n\u2192 e+\u1ebdR. Hence there exists also an\nS-algebra homomorphism T \u2212\n\u2192 R\u221e . Hence this quasifilter is absolute (Definition 1.9.1).\nThe image of S under \u03c6 : S \u2212\n\u2192 eR \u2212\n\u2192 R\u221e gives also a Frobenius cover (over Spec R and\nSpec S), since the kernel of \u03c6 is nilpotent as \u03c6 is spec-surjective. Hence by Proposition\n1.8.6 it is a filter and R\u221e is the absolute stalk.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.3.2. For a scheme X of positive characteristic such that the Frobenius morphism is finite (F -finite schemes), the Frobenius powers eX \u2212\n\u2192 X, e \u2208 (N, \u2265) belong to\nthe category and they also form an absolute filter with absolute stalk R\u221e .\n\n\f64\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nTheorem 4.3.3. Let R denote a ring of positive characteristic p endowed with the Frobenius topology, Xfrob = (Spec R)frob . Let M denote an R-module with corresponding sheaf\nMfrob in the Frobenius topology. Then for every finite Frobenius cover (i.e. for every object\nin TX ) Y \u2212\u2192 X we have \u0393(Yfrob , Mfrob ) = M \u2297R R\u221e . In particular, \u0393(Xfrob , Ofrob ) = R\u221e .\nProof. Let Y = Spec S. By Proposition 4.3.1 and Corollary 1.9.6 we have a natural\nhomomorphism \u0393(Y, Mfrob ) \u2212\n\u2192 lim\u03bb\u2208\u039b \u0393(U\u03bb , Mfrob ) = M \u2297R R\u221e , where \u039b is the indexing\n\u2212\u2192\ncategory corresponding to the fixation given by the perfect closure of R. Let f \u2208 eR be\nrepresented (e sufficiently large) by f \u2208 S \u2032 finite over S, R \u2212\n\u2192S\u2212\n\u2192 S\u2032 \u2212\n\u2192 eR finite. By\n\u2032\n\u2032\nLemma 4.1.4 the element f \u2297 1 \u2212 1 \u2297 f is nilpotent in S \u2297S S . But nilpotent elements\nvanish in some Frobenius power, so f defines a global element in \u0393(Y, Ofrob ). It follows\nthat \u0393(Yfrob , Ofrob ) \u2212\n\u2192 R\u221e is surjective and then also that \u0393(Yfrob , Mfrob ) \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2297R R\u221e is\nsurjective. On the other hand, if s \u2208 \u0393(Yfrob , Mfrob ) maps to 0 in the stalk, then it is 0 in\nsome M \u2297R eR and also in a finite Frobenius cover S \u2212\n\u2192 S \u2032 , so s itself must be 0.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.3.4. Note that already for a (non-perfect) field K the ring of global sections\nin the Frobenius topology is not the field itself, as it is in the flat topology, though the\nFrobenius homomorphism on a field is flat. This rests on the fact that the Frobenius\nhomomorphism on eK \u2297K eK, which enters the computation of the global section ring in\nthe Frobenius topology, is not flat.\n4.4. Exactness in the Frobenius topology.\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n\nProposition 4.4.1.

The equivalence (i) \u21d4 (ii) was given in Proposition 1.10.4. The equivalence (ii) \u21d4\n(iii) (for which (iv) is an explicit version) follows directly and follows also in the F -finite\ncase from Corollary 2.7.2.\n\u0003\nExample 4.4.2. The sequence 0 \u2212\n\u2192R\u2212\n\u2192 Rred is exact in the Frobenius topology.\n\nExample 4.4.3. Let R = K[x, y, v]/(x3 + y 3 + v 3 ), where K is a field of positive characteristic p 6= 2, 3. It is known that v 2 \u2208 (x, y)F if and only if p = 2 mod 3, and in this case\nalready (v 2 )p \u2208 (xp , y p ) [39, Example 2.2]. Look at the complex of R-modules\nx,y\n\nR2 \u2212\u2192 R \u2212\u2192 R/(x, y, v 2 ) .\n\nThis complex is of course not exact as R-modules. For p = 2 mod 3 it is however Frobeniusexact, since (v 2 )p is in the image of xp and y p . Therefore (x, y)R\u221e = (x, y, v 2 )R\u221e and so\nit is exact. It is not Frobenius exact for p = 1 mod 3.\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n65\n\nExample 4.4.4. Consider the domain R = K[x, y, u]/(y p \u2212 uxp ) with normalization\nK[y/x, x] and the ideal I = (x, y). The first Frobenius power of I is I [p] = (xp , y p ) = (xp ),\nso it is the principal ideal generated by xp . The ideal I is as an R-module isomorphic to\nR2 /((y, \u2212x), (uxp\u22121 , \u2212y p\u22121 )) \u223c\n= I, where e1 7\u2192 x, e2 7\u2192 y. Therefore we get isomorphisms\ne\n(say p is odd, q = p )\n\u223c I\u2297R eR .\nR2 /((y q , \u2212xq ), (uq xq(p\u22121) , \u2212y q(p\u22121) )) =\n\nFor e = 1 (q = p), the element (u, \u22121) on the left corresponds to x \u2297 u \u2212 y \u2297 1 in\nI\u2297R1R, and the natural mapping I\u2297R1R \u2212\n\u2192 I [p] sends this to uxp \u2212 y p = 0. The element\n1\nx \u2297 u \u2212 y \u2297 1 is however not 0 in I\u2297R R nor does it become 0 in I\u2297R eR for some e.\nThis is because (u, \u22121) \u2208 I\u2297R1R is mapped to (uq/p , \u22121q/p ) in I\u2297R eR, but this does not\nbelong to ((y q , \u2212xq ), (uq xq(p\u22121) , \u2212y q(p\u22121) )). Therefore 0 \u2212\n\u2192 I \u2212\n\u2192 R is exact, but not\nFrobenius-exact in the sense of Proposition 4.4.1.\n4.5. Cohomology in the Frobenius topology.\nProposition 4.5.1. Let R be a ring of positive characteristic, Xfrob = Spec R endowed\nwith the Frobenius topology, and let M denote an R-module with corresponding Frobenius sheaf Mfrob on Xfrob . Then \u021e k (Xfrob , Mfrob ) = 0 for k \u2265 1 and in particular\nH 1 (Xfrob , Mfrob ) = 0.\nProof. For every finite Frobenius cover Y \u2212\n\u2192 X we have \u0393(Y, Mfrob ) = M \u2297R R\u221e by\nTheorem 4.3.3. In particular we have \u0393(Y \u00d7X * * * \u00d7X Y, Mfrob ) = M \u2297R R\u221e , and all\nrestriction morphisms are isomorphisms. Hence the \u010cech complex is\nid\n\n0\n\nid\n\n\u0393(Xfrob , Mfrob ) = R\u221e \u2297R M \u2212\u2192 R\u221e \u2297R M \u2212\u2192 R\u221e \u2297R M \u2212\u2192 R\u221e \u2297R M \u2212\n\u2192 *** .\n\nTherefore \u021e k (Rfrob , Mfrob ) = 0 for k \u2265 1 and H 1 (Rfrob , Mfrob ) = 0 by Lemma 1.11.1.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 4.5.2. Let R be a ring of positive characteristic. Let 0 \u2212\u2192 N \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 L \u2212\u2192 0\nbe a short exact sequence of R-modules with corresponding short exact sequence of sheaves\n0 \u2212\u2192 kern = N frob \u2212\u2192 Mfrob \u2212\u2192 Lfrob \u2212\u2192 0 on Xfrob . Then H 1 (Xfrob , N frob ) = 0. In the\nsituation of Proposition 2.8.1 we get H 1 (Xfrob , Syz) = 0.\nProof. The exactness of Mfrob \u2212\n\u2192 Lfrob \u2212\n\u2192 0 induces by Proposition 4.4.1 the global exactness \u0393(Xfrob , Mfrob ) = M \u2297R R\u221e \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(Xfrob , Lfrob ) = L\u2297R R\u221e \u2212\n\u2192 0. Since H 1 (Xfrob , Mfrob )\n1\nfrob\nis 0 by Proposition 4.5.1, it follows H (Xfrob , N\n) = 0 by the long exact cohomology\nsequence.\nFor the second statement let N \u2286 M be finitely generated R-modules and let Rn \u2212\n\u2192N\nn ) = (R\u221e )n \u2212\nbe a surjection. Then \u0393(Xfrob , Ofrob\n\u2192 \u0393(Xfrob , Nfrob ) = N \u2297R R\u221e is a surjection but also N \u2297R R\u221e \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(Xfrob , N frob ) \u2286 \u0393(Xfrob , Mfrob ) = M \u2297R R\u221e is a surjection, as \u0393(Xfrob , N frob ) consists of the elements in \u0393(Xfrob , Mfrob ) which are in the Froben ) \u2212\nnius closure of N . Hence \u0393(Xfrob , Ofrob\n\u2192 \u0393(Xfrob , N frob ) is surjective and so again\n1\nH (Xfrob , Syz) = 0.\n\u0003\n5. Finite topology and plus closure\n5.1. Plus closure for ideals and for submodules.\nThe plus (or finite) closure of an ideal I \u2286 R in a domain R is given by\nI + = {f \u2208 R : \u2203R \u2286 S finite domain such that f \u2208 IS}.\n\n\f66\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nThe properties of this closure operation depend heavily on the characteristic. If R contains\na field of characteristic zero and is normal, then I + = I (this is due to the trace map,\nsee [10, Remark 9.2.4]). If however R contains a field of positive characteristic, then we\nhave I F \u2286 I + \u2286 I \u2217 , where I F is the Frobenius closure (Section 4.1) and where I \u2217 is the\ntight closure [38], [35]. Moreover, it is conjectured that I + = I \u2217 [34]. The plus closure\nmay also be characterized with the help of the so-called absolute integral closure R+ of\nR. This is the integral closure of R inside the algebraic closure Q(R) of its fraction field\n(first considered by M. Artin in [2]). The plus closure is then just I + = R \u2229 IR+ [38,\nTheorem 1.7]. R+ is a big Cohen-Macaulay algebra for excellent local domains of positive\ncharacteristic [38, Theorem 7.0], [40] or [36].\nWe first generalize this notion for rings which are not domains and for arbitrary submodules. For this we introduce finite covers.\nDefinition 5.1.1. A scheme morphism Y \u2212\n\u2192 X is called a finite cover if it is finite and\nsurjective.\nDefinition 5.1.2. For R-submodules N \u2286 M we define the finite closure of N in M by\nN +={s \u2208 M : \u2203 R \u2212\n\u2192 S a finite cover such that s \u2297 1 \u2208 im(N \u2297R S \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2297R S)} .\n\nThis definition coincides for an ideal in a domain with the standard definition due to\nProposition 5.1.3(v).\nProposition 5.1.3. Finite covers have the following properties.\n(i) The composition of finite covers is a finite cover.\n(ii) The base change of a finite cover is a finite cover.\n(iii) The reduction Xred \u2212\u2192 X is a finite cover. U\n(iv) If Xi are the integral components of X, then i\u2208I Xi \u2212\u2192 X is a finite cover.\n(v) If X is integral and Y \u2212\u2192 X is a finite cover, then there exists an integral component Y0 of Y such that Y0 \u2212\u2192 X is a finite cover. This means that every finite\ncover of an integral scheme can be refined by an integral finite cover.\nProof. These are clear. For (v) let y \u2208 Y map to the generic point of X and let y \u2208 Y0 \u2286 Y\nbe an integral component. Then Y0 \u2212\n\u2192 X is finite but also surjective by going-up [12,\nProposition 4.15].\n\u0003\nDefinition 5.1.4. Let X denote a scheme. The finite topology TX on X is given by the\nschemes over X, where all morphisms are finite and where the finite covers are covers. The\nstructural morphisms are declared to be covers. We denote X endowed with this topology\nby Xfin .\nProposition 5.1.5. The finite topology is an affine single-handed Grothendieck topology.\nEvery scheme morphism Y \u2212\u2192 X yields a corresponding site morphism Yfin \u2212\u2192 Xfin . The\nclosure induced by the finite topology is the plus closure.\nProof. This is clear from Proposition 5.1.3 and Lemma 2.4.4.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 5.1.6. In the qf h-topology introduced by Voevodsky\n([68], [64]) a cover is\nU\ngiven by a topological epimorphism (or universal submersion) Xi \u2212\n\u2192 X such that each\nXi \u2212\n\u2192 X is a quasi-finite morphism [18, D\u00e9finition 6.2.3]. So this quasifinite topology is\na refinement of the finite topology. On the other hand, over a complete local domain it\nfollows from [18, Corollaire 6.2.6] that a quasifinite cover contains a connected component\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n67\n\nwhich is a finite cover of the X (this is not true for a quasifinite surjection without the\nsubmersive property).\n5.2. The ring of global sections in the finite topology.\nDefinition 5.2.1. Let R denote a ring and let R \u2212\n\u2192 L be an R-algebra. Then we set\nRcomp/L = {f \u2208 L : there exists a finite R-algebra T \u2286 L such that\nf \u2208 T and f \u2297 1 \u2212 1 \u2297 f \u2208 T \u2297R T is nilpotent}\n\nand call it the compatible integral closure of R in L.\n\nCompare [45, Section I] for this definition. By the compatible normalization of a domain\nR we mean the compatible integral closure of R in L = Q(R)\u221e , and denote it by Rcomp .\nRecall that the seminormalization of a ring is the biggest ring inside the normalization\nwhich does not separate points and does not change the residue class fields, see [43, Definition 7.2.1]. The following characterization of the seminormalization is due to Manaresi,\nsee [45, Theorem I.6]. We include a proof.\nLemma 5.2.2. Let R denote a noetherian domain in characteristic zero. Then the seminormalization is the compatible normalization.\nProof. The seminormalization Spec Rsemi \u2212\n\u2192 Spec R is a homeomorphism and induces\nisomorphisms \u03ba(x) \u2212\n\u2192 \u03ba(x\u2032 ) for x \u2208 Spec R. The same is true for R \u2286 S \u2286 Rsemi . Let f \u2208\nS \u2286 Rsemi be given, R \u2286 S finite, and consider f \u2297 1 \u2212 1 \u2297 f \u2208 S\u2297R S \u2212\n\u2192 Rsemi \u2297R Rsemi .\nFor every ring homomorphism R \u2212\n\u2192 \u03ba(x) there exists exactly one ring homomorphism\nsemi\nR\n\u2212\n\u2192 \u03ba(x). Therefore by Lemma 1.6.5 we know that f \u2297 1 \u2212 1 \u2297 f is nilpotent (in\nS\u2297R S and in Rsemi \u2297R Rsemi ). Hence f \u2208 Rcomp .\nNow suppose that an element f in the normalization is compatible. We know by Lemma\n1.6.6 that it has a uniquely determined value in \u03ba(x) at each point x \u2208 Spec R. Therefore\nf belongs to the seminormalization.\n\u0003\nProposition 5.2.3. Let R denote a noetherian domain, X = Spec R. Then the ring\nof global sections in the finite topology is the compatible normalization inside the perfect\nclosure Q(R)\u221e , i.e. \u0393(Xfin , Ofin ) = Rcomp .\nProof. The natural morphism (Spec Q(R))fin \u2212\n\u2192 Xfin induces the ring homomorphism\n\u0393(Xfin , Ofin ) \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(Q(R)fin , Ofin ). First note that \u0393(Q(R)fin , Ofin ) = Q(R)\u221e , by Theorem\n4.3.3 and Proposition 3.4.1.\nAn element f \u2208 \u0393(X, Ofin ) is represented by f \u2208 S, where R \u2212\n\u2192 S is a finite cover. The\ncompatibility condition for the sheafification means exactly that f \u2297 1 \u2212 1 \u2297 f \u2208 S\u2297R S is\nnilpotent. Hence the natural ring homomorphism maps into the compatible normalization.\nSuppose that f \u2208 Rcomp \u2286 Q(R)\u221e and that it is represented by f \u2208 S, R \u2212\n\u2192 S a\nfinite cover. Then f \u2297 1 \u2212 1 \u2297 f \u2208 S\u2297R S is nilpotent. Since reductions are finite covers\n(Proposition 5.1.3(iii)), this means that f \u2208 S is compatible in the sense of sheafification\nand gives a global element in \u0393(Y, Ofin ). Hence the homomorphism is surjective.\nSuppose that f \u2208 \u0393(Xfin , Ofin ) maps to 0. We may assume that f is represented by\nf \u2208 S, where S is a domain (Proposition 5.1.3(v)). Hence the image of f in \u0393(Q(R), Ofin )\nis represented by f considered in Q(S). So f = 0.\n\u0003\n\n\f68\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nRemark 5.2.4. The seminormalization is also the ring of global sections in the submersive\ntopology resp. h-topology (see [68, Proposition 3.2.10] and [4]) The normalization cannot\nbe the ring of global sections for a Grothendieck topology which is functorial for all scheme\nmorphisms, since the normalization is not functorial for quotient rings, see the following\nexample.\nExample 5.2.5. Let R \u2282 C[[x]] denote the subring consisting of formal power series with\n2\nconstant term in R. Then xi\nx = i and i = \u22121 \u2208 R, hence i is both rational and integral\nover R and so C[[x]] is the normalization of R. The residue class field of R with respect\nto the maximal ideal mR = (x, ix) is the (normal) field R, but there does not exist an\nR-algebra homomorphism between the normalizations C[[x]] \u2212\n\u2192 R. In particular i is not\ncompatible, and \u0393(Rfin , Ofin ) = R.\n5.3. Absolute stalks in the finite topology.\nThere are several relevant absolute filters in the finite topology to study. Already for\nan integral scheme it is not clear which one is the best choice.\nProposition 5.3.1. Let R denote a noetherian ring with integral components Ri , i \u2208 I.\nQ\nQ\nSet R+ := i\u2208I (Ri )+ . Then i\u2208I Q(Ri ) and also R+ define an absolute filter in Xfin =\n(Spec R)fin with absolute stalk R+ .\nProof. By Proposition 5.1.3(v) we may assume that R is a domain, because we can treat\nthe components separately. Every ring homomorphism S \u2212\n\u2192 Q(R), S a finite cover,\nfactors uniquely through R+ , so we restrict to the fixation given by R+ .\nNote first that for every finite cover R \u2212\n\u2192 S there exists an R-algebra homomorphism\n+\nS\u2212\n\u2192 R . According to Proposition 5.1.3(v) there exists a homomorphism S \u2212\n\u2192 S0 to a\ndomain which is a finite extension of R. Hence we may assume that S is a domain. Then\nQ(R) \u2212\n\u2192 Q(S) is a finite field extension and hence there exists an inclusion Q(S) \u2286 Q(R).\nThis gives an inclusion S \u2286 R+ . So in the quasifilter given by the fixation with R+ every\nfinite cover occurs. It is a filter by Proposition 1.8.6, since the image of a finite cover S in\nR+ is itself a finite (integral) cover over R.\nTo show that it is absolute let S \u2212\n\u2192 R+ be an R-algebra homomorphism and let S \u2212\n\u2192T\nbe in TR . Then let S be the image of S in R+ and let T be a T -algebra which is a finite\n\u2192 R+\ndomain over S. Then there exists an S-embedding of T into R+ . This gives T \u2212\n+\nover S. The stalk in this absolute filter is of course R .\n\u0003\nExample 5.3.2. It is also useful to consider the filter where the objects are only the\ndomains S with a fixation R \u2212\n\u2192 S \u2212\n\u2192 R+ . This is a quasifilter since for two finite\n\u2032\ndomains R \u2286 S, S there exists a common finite domain in R+ containing both. It is again\nan absolute filter by similar arguments as in the proof of Proposition 5.3.1. The only\nmorphisms in this filter are inclusion of domains. Moreover, it is a covering filter (Remark\n1.9.2), since every finite R-homomorphism S \u2212\n\u2192 T is a cover when S is a domain (because\nT \u2208 TR is a finite cover over R).\n\nExample 5.3.3. Consider the affine line A1K = Spec R, R = K[x] in the finite topology\nand consider the fixation given by R+ \u2295K + (where in the second component x is sent to 0).\nx\n\nThis is again an absolute filter with absolute stalk R+ \u2295 K + . The sequence 0 \u2212\n\u2192R\u2212\n\u2192R\nis not exact in this absolute filter, since it is not exact in K + . Proposition 1.10.4(i)-(v) do\nnot hold, but (vi) and (vii) hold, since for given Y the sequence is not T -exact in general,\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n69\n\nbut its restriction to an integral component of dimension one is. Note that these inclusions\nbelong to the category, but are not always indicated by the filter (e.g. A1 \u2282 A1 \u228e {x} is\nnot indicated).\nProposition 5.3.4. Let R denote a noetherian ring with integral components Ri , i \u2208 I.\nLet N \u2286 M be R-modules, s \u2208 M . Then the following are equivalent.\n(i) s \u2208 N + .\n(ii) s \u2208 Ni+ , where Ni is the image of N \u2297R Ri inside Mi = M \u2297R Ri .\n(iii) There exists a finite and spec-surjective ring homomorphism R \u2212\u2192 S such that\ns \u2297 1 \u2208 im(N \u2297R S \u2212\u2192 M \u2297R S).\n(iv) s \u2208 N top\u2212cl , where top \u2212 cl denotes the closure operation induced by the finite\ntopology on Spec R.\n(v) s \u2297 1 \u2208 im(N \u2297R R+ \u2212\u2192 M \u2297R R+ ), where R+ is the absolute stalk.\nProof. (i) and (iii) are equivalent by Definition 5.1.2. The defining property (iii) might be\nchecked on the components by Proposition 5.1.3, hence (i) and (ii) are equivalent. The\nequivalence of (iii) and (iv) was mentioned in Proposition 5.1.5. The equivalence of (iv)\nand (v) follows from Corollary 2.4.10 and Proposition 5.3.1.\n\u0003\nRemark 5.3.5. The exactness of a complex in the finite topology is a strong condition,\nsince X \u222a {x} \u2212\n\u2192 X is a finite cover, where x is a closed point of X. If a sheafified\ncomplex is exact on Xfin , then this implies that it is exact on every closed point! Hence\nthe exactness in the finite topology for a scheme of finite type over a field implies the\nexactness in the surjective topology (Theorem 3.9.1 and Remark 3.9.4). The converse is\nnot true, as Rn\n\nf1 ,...,fn\n\n\u2212\n\u2192 R\u2212\n\u2192 R/ rad(I) \u2212\n\u2192 0 shows, where I = (f1 , . . . , fn ) \u2286 I + \u2282 rad(I).\n\nWe characterize now the exactness in the absolute filter given by R+ .\n\nProposition 5.3.6.

This follows from Proposition 1.10.4 applied to the (integral) absolute filter given\nby R+ . The equivalence of (v) and (vii) was proven in Proposition 2.7.1.\n\u0003\n5.4. Cohomology in the finite topology.\nThe computation of cohomology in the finite topology , e.g. of the structure sheaf, provides us with several difficulties. So we give here only a result concerning the normalization\nof a curve and some examples.\nProposition 5.4.1. Let C = Spec R be an affine integral curve over an algebraically\nclosed field K and let C nor \u2212\u2192 C its normalization. Then \u021e 1 (C nor \u2212\u2192 C, Ofin ) = 0.\nProof. Let S \u2282 C be the set of singular points. For P \u2208 S let P1 , . . . , PnP be the points\nin C nor mapping to P . Then\nC nor \u00d7C C nor = C nor \u228e {Pij , 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 nP , i 6= j : P \u2208 S}\n\n(the points Pii are the points Pi \u2208 C nor ), and similarly C nor \u00d7C C nor \u00d7C C nor = C nor \u228e{Pijk }.\nThe indices of the points show where to one has to project, e.g. q1 (Pijk ) = p2,3 (Pijk ) = Pjk .\nLet now a cocycle h \u2208 Rnor \u2297R Rnor (this is seminormal) be given (Section 1.11). On the\ndiagonal \u25b3 = C nor the cocycle condition gives immediately h|C nor = 0. On the isolated\npoints the cocycle condition gives\n(q1\u2217 \u2212 q2\u2217 + q3\u2217 )(h)(Pijk ) = h(Pjk ) \u2212 h(Pik ) + h(Pij ) = 0 .\n\n2\n\n\u2192\nFor every P \u2208 S this is exactly the cocycle condition for the complex K I \u2212\n\u2192 KI \u2212\n3\nI\n\u2192 {P }). Hence there\nK , where I = {P1 , . . . , PnP } (the \u010cech complex of the cover I \u2212\nexist values h(P1 ), . . . , h(PnP ) such that the differences of the pull-backs under the two\nprojections are h(Pij ). Since C nor is affine there exists a global function g \u2208 \u0393(C nor , OC nor )\nsuch that g(Pi ) = h(Pi ) for all Pi , P \u2208 S, i = 1, . . . , nP . Then the derivation maps g to\nh, and so h is a coboundary.\n\u0003\nExample 5.4.2. One of the difficulties in computing cohomology in the finite topology is\nthat the ring of global sections is the seminormalization. This might bring in new cocycles\nwhich are not seen on the presheaf level. Let K be an algebraically closed field and consider\nthe (flat)Qextension R = K[x] \u2212\n\u2192 K[y] = S, x 7\u2192 y n . Then S\u2297R S = K[y, z]/(y n \u2212 z n ) =\nK[y, z]/( \u03b6n (y \u2212 \u03b6n z)). This ring consists of n lines in the plane meeting in the origin (say\nthe characteristic does not divide n). So Spec S\u2297R S has embedding dimension 2 and is\nfor n \u2265 3 not seminormal, its seminormalization is the scheme of n axes with embedding\ndimension n [7, Section 3]. Hence \u0393(S\u2297R S, Ofin ) 6= S\u2297R S.\nExample 5.4.3. Let R = K[u, v]/(uv) with normalization Rnor = K[s] \u2295 K[t], u = (s, 0)\nand v = (0, t). Consider the principal ideal I = (g) = (u + v) (cf. Example 2.8.2). Then\nin Rnor we have f = u = (s, 0) = (1, 0)(s, t) = (1, 0)(u + v). So f \u2208 I + (but f 6\u2208 I).\nSet X = Spec R and Y = Spec Rnor . We want to compute \u021e 1 (Y \u2212\n\u2192 X, Syz), where\nSyz is given as the kernel of g : Ofin \u2212\n\u2192 I fin \u2286 Ofin (so Syz is the annihilator of g), and\n\u03b4(f ) \u2208 \u021e 1 (Y \u2212\n\u2192 X, Syz) (the cohomology of the structure sheaf is 0 as in Proposition\n5.4.1).\nY \u00d7X Y consists of two lines L1 , L2 and two points P1,2 and P2,1 . Y \u00d7X Y \u00d7X Y consists\nagain of two lines L1 , L2 and 8 points Pi,j,k , where P1,1,1 \u2208 L1 and P2,2,2 \u2208 L2 and where\nthe other six points are isolated components.\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n71\n\nThe pull-back of the function g = u + v to Y \u00d7X Y and to Y \u00d7X Y \u00d7X Y is the function\nwhich is s on L1 and t on L2 and has value 0 on the isolated points. So the annihilator of\ng consists of the functions which are zero on the two lines and have arbitrary values on the\nisolated points. Let h \u2208 \u0393(Y \u00d7X Y, Syz) have values h(P1,2 ) = h and h(P2,1 ) = b (and = 0\non the lines). The cocycle condition is (p\u22172,3 \u2212 p\u22171,3 + p\u22171,2 )(h) = 0. This means evaluated\nat P1,2,1 that 0 = h(P2,1 ) \u2212 h(P1,1 ) + h(P1,2 ) = h \u2212 0 + b (P2,1,2 yields the same, the other\npoints yield no condition). So the cocycle condition reduces to b = \u2212h, and since there\nare no coboundaries at all, we infer that \u021e 1 (Y \u2212\n\u2192 X, Syz) has dimension one.\nnor\nWe come to the computation of \u03b4(f ). In R\nwe have f = qg, q = (1, 0), so we have\nto compute the difference between the pull-backs of q under the two projections. The\npull back of q under both projections gives on L1 the function 1 and on L2 the function\n0. The values of the pull backs under the projections at the points are p\u22171 (q)(P1,2 ) = 1,\np\u22171 (q)(P2,1 ) = 0, p\u22172 (q)(P1,2 ) = 0, p\u22172 (q)(P2,1 ) = 1. Hence the difference is 0 on L1 and L2\nand has value 1 at P1,2 and \u22121 at P2,1 . So this difference gives an element in \u0393(Y \u00d7X Y, Syz)\nwhich represents the cohomology class \u03b4(f ) \u2208 H 1 (X, Syz).\n6. Topologies defined by Zariski filters and torsion theories\nSome properties of a variety, or objects associated to it, depend only on the points of\ncodimension one, i.e. they are unchanged if we remove a subset of codimension at least two,\nlike e.g. the divisor class group. Other objects get simpler after removing small subsets,\ne.g. torsion-free sheaves are locally free in codimension one. A (hereditary) torsion theory\nfor R-modules studies which part of a module can be neglected in a certain sense. The\nnotions of a pure resp. parafactorial pair are defined by requiring that the restriction\nof an \u00e9tale covering resp. an invertible sheaf to an open subset gives an equivalence of\ncategories ([22, Expos\u00e9s X.3 and XI.3], [20, D\u00e9finition 21.13.1]). In birational geometry\none may restrict to any non-empty open subset. So smaller open subsets may have the\nfull or the essential information, hence they are covers in a certain sense. We formalize\nthese observations in this part.\n6.1. Zariski filters.\nDefinition 6.1.1. A Zariski filter on a scheme X is a topological filter F in the Zariski\ntopology, i.e. a non-empty collection of open subsets V \u2286 X such that V \u2208 F and V \u2286 U\nimplies U \u2208 F and such that V, U \u2208 F implies V \u2229 U \u2208 F .\nA Zariski filter on X defines for every morphism \u03c8 : Y \u2212\n\u2192 X a Zariski filter \u03c8 \u2217 (F ) on\n\u2217\n\u22121\nY by setting \u03c8 (F ) = {W \u2286 Y : W \u2287 \u03c8 (V ) for some V \u2208 F }. In particular, for an\nopen subset U \u2286 X this is FU = F |U = {U \u2229 V : V \u2208 F } (we will also write W \u2208 FU if\nwe mean U \u2229 W \u2208 FU ).\nDefinition 6.1.2. Let X denote a scheme and let F denote a Zariski filter on X. The\nGrothendieck topology Xzftop induced by F is Sgiven by all (Zariski-)open subsets\nof X,\nS\nand Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U , i \u2208 I, is a covering if and only if i\u2208I Ui \u2208 FU , that is, U \u2229 V \u2286 i\u2208I Ui for\nsome V \u2208 F .\nRemark 6.1.3. Here we design the Grothendieck topology given by a Zariski filter to be\na non-affine topology which is a refinement of the Zariski topology. The open sets V \u2208 F\ndefine the single covers of X. This topology is flat, but not faithfully flat. If X and Y\n\n\f72\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nare schemes with Zariski filters FX and FY , then a morphism \u03c8 : Y \u2212\n\u2192 X induces a site\n\u2217\nmorphism Yzftop \u2212\n\u2192 Xzftop if and only if \u03c8 (FX ) \u2286 FY .\nExample 6.1.4. Consider a pair (X0 , X) consisting of a scheme X and a subset X0 \u2286 X.\nAll open neighborhoods V \u2287 X0 form a filter denoted by F (X0 ). A morphism\n\u03c8:Y \u2212\n\u2192X\nU\nSpec\nOx\nwhich maps\nY\n\u2286\nY\ninto\nX\ninduces\na\nsite\nmorphism.\nThe\ndisjoint\nunion\n0\n0\nx\u2208X0\nU\n(but also x\u2208X0 Spec \u03ba(x)) gives an absolute cover (Definition 1.9.3) for this topology.\nExample 6.1.5. For a natural number k \u2208 N and a scheme X denote by X (k) the points\nof height at most k, that is,\nX (k) := {x \u2208 X : dim OX,x \u2264 k} .\n\nLet FXk denote the filter consisting of all open subsets which contain X (k) . A morphism\n\u03c8 : Y \u2212\n\u2192 X with the property that \u03c8(Y (k) ) \u2286 X (k) (so that there are no contractions\nof points of height k to points of bigger height) induces a site morphism. For k = 0 see\nExample 6.1.10, for k = 1 see Section 6.4.\nProposition 6.1.6. Let a Zariski filter F be given on a topologically noetherian scheme\nX given rise to the Grothendieck topology Xzftop . Let M be a quasicoherent OX -module\nand let N \u2286 M be a submodule. Then the following holds.\n(i) The module of global sections is \u0393(Xzftop , Mzftop ) = limV \u2208F \u0393(V, M ).\n\u2212\u2192\n(ii) The assignment U 7\u2192 \u0393(Uzftop , Mzftop ) for U \u2286 X open is a quasicoherent OX module.\n(iii) The sheafification M 7\u2192 Mzftop is exact.\n(iv) The Zariski filter F is an absolute filter in the Grothendieck topology, and the\nabsolute stalk of a module is the same as its module of global sections.\n(v) The closure operation induced by Xzftop is (on an open affine subset)\nN zftop\u2212c = {s \u2208 M : \u03c1X\nV (s) \u2208 \u0393(V, N ) for some V \u2208 F } .\n\nIf F = F (X0 ) for a subset X0 \u2286 X, then\n\nN zftop\u2212c = {s \u2208 M : sx \u2208 Nx for all x \u2208 X0 } .\n\n(vi) If M is coherent, then Mzftop = 0 if and only if M |V = 0 for some V \u2208 F , and\nthis is true if and only if the support of M does not meet V .\n(vii) We have H k (Xzftop , Mzftop ) = limV \u2208F H k (V, M ).\n\u2212\u2192\nProof. (i). The (Zariski-)module U 7\u2192 \u0393(U, M ) is the associated Ozftop -premodule in the\nsense of Proposition 1.5.5(iv), which we have to sheafify. We have\n\u0393(U, M0 ) = {s \u2208 \u0393(U, M ) : \u03c1U\nU \u2229V (s) = 0 for some V \u2208 F }\n\nand the associated separated presheaf is \u0393(U, M1 ) = \u0393(U, M )/\u0393(U, M0 ) (see Section 1.2).\nWe claim that there are natural homomorphisms\nlim \u0393(V, M ) \u2212\u2192 lim \u0393(V, M1 ) \u2212\u2192 \u0393(Xzftop , Mzftop ) .\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\n\nV \u2208F\n\nV \u2208F\n\nIt is clear that the first mapping exists and that it is a bijection. For the existence of\nthe second map, let s \u2208 \u0393(V, M1 ), V \u2208 F . Since V \u00d7X V = V \u2229 V = V , the section s is\ncompatible by Lemma 1.6.7, so we get a mapping \u0393(V, M1 ) \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(Xzftop , Mzftop ) and also\nfrom the colimit.\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n73\n\nEvery global section s \u2208 \u0393(Xzftop , Mzftop ) is given by a compatible family si \u2208 \u0393(Ui , M ),\ni \u2208 I, in a covering Ui \u2212\n\u2192 U , so that the differences are 0 in \u0393(Ui \u2229 Uj , M1 ). We may\nassume that I is finite, since U is quasicompact, and S\nsuppose that\ns \u2212 sj \u2208 \u0393(Ui \u2229 Uj , M )\nT i\nrestricts to 0 in Ui \u2229 Uj \u2229 Vij , Vij \u2208 F . Then W := ( i\u2208I Ui ) \u2229 (i,j)\u2208I\u00d7I Vij \u2208 FU and si\nis represented by an element s \u2208 \u0393(W, M ). Hence the second mapping is surjective. It is\ninjective as it is the sheafification homomorphism of a separated presheaf.\n(ii). By (i) we have \u0393(Uzftop , Mzftop ) = limV \u2208F \u0393(U \u2229V, M ). For fixed V , the assignment\n\u2212\u2192\nU 7\u2192 \u0393(U \u2229V, M ) is a sheaf, as it is the push forward of M |V under V \u2286 X. Therefore also\nthe colimit U 7\u2192 limV \u2208F \u0393(U \u2229 V, M ) is a sheaf [27, Exercise II.1.11]. For quasicoherence\n\u2212\u2192\nwe may assume hat X is affine and that f \u2208 \u0393(X, OX ). Then we have limV \u2208F \u0393(D(f ) \u2229\n\u2212\u2192\nV, M ) = limV \u2208F \u0393(V, M )f = (limV \u2208F \u0393(V, M ))f (see [27, Lemma II.5.14] for the first\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\nequality).\n(iii). The sheafification is G 7\u2192 limV \u2208F (i\u2217 (G|V ), (i : V \u2212\n\u2192 X) so the left exactness of\n\u2212\u2192\nthe sheafification follows from the left exactness of push forward and from the exactness\nof taking the colimit. The right exactness follows from Lemma 1.3.6.\n(iv). The filter F is a small cofiltered category (Definition 1.2.1) with an arrow U \u2212\n\u2192V\ncorresponding to an inclusion U \u2286 V . The inclusions U \u2212\n\u2192 V and U \u2032 \u2212\n\u2192 V come together\nin the intersection U \u2229 U \u2032 \u2212\n\u2192 U, U \u2032 . The identical mapping gives then a filter in the sense\nof Definition 1.7.1. It is clearly an absolute filter in the sense of Definition 1.9.1 (but not\nirreducible, as the topology is not single-handed). Then we have limV \u2208F \u0393(Vzftop , Mzftop ) =\n\u2212\u2192\nlimV \u2208F (limW \u2208F \u0393(V \u2229 W, M )) = limV \u2208F \u0393(V, M ) = \u0393(Xzftop , Mzftop ).\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\n(v) follows from Lemma 1.4.5 or directly. For the second part suppose first that \u03c1X\nV (s) \u2208\n\u0393(V, N ) for some V \u2208 F . Then X0 \u2286 V and so sx = \u03c1x (\u03c1X\n(s))\n\u2208\nN\nfor\nall\nx\n\u2208 X0 .\nx\nV\nOn the other hand, if sx \u2208 Nx , then\nthere\nexists\nan\nopen\nneighborhood\nof\nx\n\u2208\nV\nx such\nS\nX\nX\nthat \u03c1Vx (s) \u2208 \u0393(Vx , N ). Then V = x\u2208X0 Vx is an open neighborhood of X0 and \u03c1V (s) \u2208\n\u0393(V, N ), since it is locally true.\n(vi). We may reduce to X affine by (ii). Let s1 , . . . , sn be generators of M . Since\nMzftop = 0, there exists by (v) for every i an Vi \u2208 F such that \u03c1X\nVi (si ) = 0 in \u0393(Vi , M ), so\nall generators become 0 in \u0393(V1 \u2229 . . . \u2229 Vn , M ). On the other hand, if M |V = 0, V \u2208 F ,\nthen the module is 0 in a covering, hence it is 0.\n(vii). The right hand side has all the properties of a universal \u03b4-functor for Xzftop [27,\nCorollary III.1.4].\n\u0003\nRemark 6.1.7. The statements (i), (iii) and (vii) in Proposition 6.1.6 hold for arbitrary\nsheaves of abelian groups on X in the sense that \u0393(Xzftop , \u03c6\u22121 (G)# ) = limV \u2208F \u0393(V, G).\n\u2212\u2192\nExample 6.1.8. Let X = Spec R denote an affine scheme and let T denote a multiplicatively closed subset in R defining the topological filter FT consisting of open subsets\nV \u2287 D(f ) for some f \u2208 T . Then for an R-module M the module of global sections is\n\u0393(Xzftop , Mzftop ) = lim \u0393(V, M ) = lim Mf = MT .\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\nV \u2208FT\n\nNc\n\nf \u2208T\n\nThe closure of N \u2286 M is\n= {s \u2208 M : s \u2208 NT in MT } = {s \u2208 M : \u2203f \u2208\nT such that f s \u2208 N }. In the case of such an algebraically defined filter one can also define\nan affine Grothendieck topology with the same closure operation by declaring R \u2212\n\u2192 Rf\nto be a cover if f belongs to the saturated multiplicative system given by T (that is, f\ndivides some element in T ).\n\n\f74\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nThe affine scheme Spec RT gives an absolute cover for this topology. If X0 = {p \u2208\nSpec RT } = {p \u2208 Spec R, p \u2229 T = \u2205}, then also F (X0 ) = FT . On the other hand, if X0 is\na finite collection of prime ideals pS1 , . . . , pn , then the filter of open neighborhoods F (X0 )\nis given algebraically by T = R \u2212 ni=1 pi .\nExample 6.1.9. Let X = Spec R be affine and let T \u2286 R be the multiplicative system\nof all non-zero divisors. The open subsets {V \u2286 X : V \u2287 D(f ) for some f \u2208 T } form\na Zariski filter, and we denote the corresponding Grothendieck topology by Xnzd . The\ninduced closure operation on submodules is the (non-zero divisor-) torsion,\nN nzd\u2212c = tors(N ) = {s \u2208 M : s = 0 in(M/N )T } .\n\nThe quotient module M/tors(0) is torsion-free. The module of global sections is then\n\u0393(Rnzd , Mnzd ) = MT , and M/tors(0) \u2286 MT is a torsion-free submodule.\nMnzd is trivial if\nS\nand only if M is a torsion module. If R is noetherian, then T = R \u2212 ni=1 pi , where pi runs\nthrough the associated primes of R [12, Theorem 3.1]. Therefore N nzd\u2212c = {s \u2208 M : s \u2208\nNp for all associated primes p} (Proposition 6.1.6(v)). Here one can also restrict to the\nmaximal members among Ass(R). For an ideal I 6= 0 in a domain R always I nzd\u2212c = R.\nFor a scheme X the same definitions apply. For an OX -submodule G \u2286 F the closure G nzd\u2212c defined by the property that F/G nzd\u2212c is torsion-free is sometimes called the\nsaturation of G.\nExample 6.1.10. For a scheme X let Fdense be the topological filter of all open dense\nsubsets V in X. This means for X irreducible that V is non-empty, and in general that V\nmeets every irreducible component. This is the special case k = 0 of Example 6.1.5, and\nwe call this topology the dense topology and denote it by Xdense .\nLet X = Spec R be affine, and let N \u2286 M be R-modules. The closure operation induced\nby the dense topology is the \"dense\" torsion of a submodule, in the sense that\nN dense\u2212c = {s \u2208 M : s = 0 in (M/N )p for all minimal prime ideals p} .\n\nFor R noetherian, the module of global sections is \u0393(Rdense , Mdense ) =\n\nL\n\nht p=0 Mp .\n\n6.2. Submodules with support condition.\nThe easiest topological filters are the ones given by just one open subset U \u2286 X, so\nthat F (U ) = {V : V \u2287 U }. The closure operations coming from these filters are directly\nrelated to support conditions and to local cohomology. Recall the following definition.\nDefinition 6.2.1. Let R be a ring, J an ideal and M an R-module. Then\n\u0393J (M ) = {s \u2208 M : J k s = 0 for some k \u2208 N}\n\nis called the module of sections in M with support in J.\nIf X is a scheme with an open subset U \u2286 X and closed complement Z = X \u2212 U , and\nif F is a sheaf on X, then\n\u0393Z (X, F) = {s \u2208 \u0393(X, F) : supp(s) \u2286 Z}\n\nis called the module of sections with support in Z [22, Expos\u00e9 I].\n\nLemma 6.2.2. Let X be a scheme and let U \u2286 X be an open subset. Let F be an OX module. Then \u0393X\u2212U (X, F) is the closure of 0 in \u0393(X, F) in the Grothendieck topology\ninduced by U (that is, induced by the filter F (U )). In particular, if R is a noetherian ring\nwith an ideal J, then \u0393J (M ) is the closure of 0 in the topology induced by D(J).\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n75\n\nProof. In general, supp(s) = {x \u2208 X : sx 6= 0} \u2286 Z if and only if s = 0 in \u0393(U, F). So the\nstatement follows from Proposition 6.1.6(v). In the case of a noetherian ring, if s \u2208 M\nrestricts to 0 on U = D(J), then, letting J = (g1 , . . . , gm ), we also have giki s = 0 and so\nJ k s = 0 for k = k1 + . . . + km . On the other hand, if J k s = 0, then s|U = 0.\n\u0003\nRecall that \u0393J (\u2212) is left exact (this follows also from Proposition 6.1.6(iii) and Lemma\n2.4.9) and induces a right derived functor, called local cohomology (see [22], [9]). This is\ntrue more generally for a Zariski filter F (but not for an arbitrary closure operation, see\nExample 6.2.4). In this case we also write\n\u0393F (M ) = {s \u2208 \u0393(X, M ) : s|V = 0 for someV \u2208 F } = lim \u0393X\u2212V (M ) .\n\u2212\u2192\nV \u2208F\n\nThe long exact cohomology sequences [22, Corollaire I.2.9] for V \u2208 F induce a long exact\ncohomology sequence in the colimit, namely\n0 \u2212\u2192 \u0393F (M ) \u2212\u2192 \u0393(X, M ) \u2212\u2192 lim H 0 (V, M ) = H 0 (Xzftop , Mzftop ) \u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\nV \u2208F\n\nHF1 (M ) \u2212\u2192 H 1 (X, M ) \u2212\u2192 lim H 1 (V, M ) = H 1 (Xzftop , Mzftop ) \u2212\u2192 .\n\u2212\u2192\nV \u2208F\n\nExample 6.2.3. For a commutative ring R with an ideal J the closure of an R-submodule\nN \u2286 M is given as N c = {s \u2208 M : J k s \u2286 N for some k}. If R = K[x1 , . . . , xd ] is a\npolynomial ring, and J = m = (x1 , . . . , xd ), then for an ideal I \u2286 R this closure yields\nI c = {f \u2208 R : mk f \u2286 I for some n}, which is also called the saturation of the ideal. A\nhomogeneous ideal I and its saturation I sat define the same projective variety Proj R/I =\nProj R/I sat .\nExample 6.2.4. The closure of 0 is not left exact in general. Let K be a field and let\nR = K[\u03b5]/(\u03b52 ), and suppose we are in the surjective Grothendieck topology (Part 3).\nThen the short exact sequence of R-modules 0 \u2212\n\u2192K \u223c\n\u2192R\u2212\n\u2192 R/(\u03b5) = K \u2212\n\u21920\n= (\u03b5) \u2212\nyields the non-exact sequence of closures of 0 (radicals), 0 \u2212\n\u21920\u2212\n\u2192 (\u03b5) \u2212\n\u21920\u2212\n\u2192 0. So the\nleft-exactness of \u0393J (\u2212) is a particularity of the functor \"sections with support in\".\n6.3. Torsion theories, Zariski filters and Grothendieck topologies.\nIn this section we relate Grothendieck topologies induced by a Zariski filter to hereditary\ntorsion theories and show that they are essentially the same. Torsion theories for abelian\ncategories have gained a lot of attention, in particular for the category of left-modules for\nnon-commutative rings. We recall briefly the basics of torsion theory until we are able to\ntranslate them into our setting. Introductions to torsion theories can be found in [3], [11],\n[16] or [65, Chapter 3].\nA torsion theory on an abelian category C (think of the category of R-modules) consists\nin two classes T and F of objects (the \"torsion class\" and the \"torsion-free class\") of C\nsuch that T \u2229 F = {0}, T is closed under quotients, F is closed under subobjects, and\nfor every object M \u2208 C there exists a short exact sequence 0 \u2212\n\u2192T \u2212\n\u2192M \u2212\n\u2192F \u2212\n\u2192 0 with\nT \u2208 T and F \u2208 F, see [11]. There exists then also such a short exact sequence where T\nis maximal ([11, Proposition 2.4] or [65, Proposition 3.1]), called the torsion submodule of\nM.\nWe restrict to the case of R-modules and we denote the torsion submodule of M by TM .\nThe class T is characterized by the property TM = M [65, Proposition 3.2]. A torsion\n\n\f76\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\ntheory is immediately a closure operation for the 0-submodule and it becomes a closure\noperation for submodules N \u2286 M by pulling back the torsion submodule from M/N [65,\nChapter 3.4]. A torsion theory is called hereditary if T is also closed under subobjects.\nTheorem 6.3.1. Let R be a noetherian commutative ring. Then the following structures\nare equivalent.\n(i) A closure operation on R-Mod coming from a Grothendieck topology on Spec R\n(i.e. an admissible closure operation) such that the functor M 7\u2192 0cM is left exact.\n(ii) A hereditary torsion theory on R-Mod.\n(iii) A Gabriel filter GF of ideals. This is a set of ideals fulling (a) if J \u2208 GF and\ng \u2208 R, then (J : g) \u2208 GF and (b) if J \u2208 GF and if (I : g) \u2208 GF for all g \u2208 J,\nthen also I \u2208 GF [65, Definition 3.4].\n(iv) A Zariski filter of open subsets in Spec R.\nProof. We describe the constructions leading from one structure to another. From (i)\nto (ii). One declares T to be the class of R-modules M with 0c = M and F to be the\nR-modules with 0c = 0. We go through the axioms of a torsion theory. T \u2229 F = 0 is\nclear. Let \u03c6 : T \u2212\n\u2192 S \u2212\n\u2192 0 be a surjection and suppose that T is T -torsion. Then\n0cS \u2287 \u03c6(0cT ) = \u03c6(T ) = S. If 0 \u2212\n\u2192G\u2212\n\u2192 F is an injection and 0cF = 0, then by the module\npersistence (Proposition 2.2.6(i)) of the closure operation also 0cG = 0, so G \u2208 F.\nSo far we have not used the left-exactness. For M we consider the short exact sequence\n\u03c6\n\n0 \u2212\n\u2192 0c \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2212\n\u2192 M/0c = F \u2212\n\u2192 0. By left exactness we have also the intersection\nc\nproperty N \u2229 0M = 0cN for N \u2286 M . For if t \u2208 N maps to 0cM , then it maps to 0 in 0cM/N\nand by left exactness it must belong to 0cN . From this intersection property it follows that\n0c0c = 0cM , so this module belongs to T . By the independence of presentation (Proposition\nM\n2.2.6(ii)) we have \u03c6\u22121 (0cF ) = (\u03c6\u22121 (0))c = (0c )c = 0c , hence 0cF = 0 and F \u2208 F. By the\nintersection property it also follows for 0 \u2212\n\u2192S\u2212\n\u2192 T and T \u2208 T that S \u2208 T , so (T , F) is\na hereditary torsion theory.\nThe equivalence of (ii) and (iii) is a well known fact from torsion theory (see [65,\nProposition 3.6]). In a hereditary torsion theory for R-modules one has TM = {s \u2208 M :\nR/ Ann(s) \u2208 T }, hence a hereditary torsion theory is characterized by the set of ideals\nJ \u2286 R such that R/J belongs to T . These ideals form the Gabriel filter GF = GF (T , F)\nof the torsion theory. A Gabriel filter GF defines a hereditary torsion theory by setting\nTM = {s \u2208 M : Ann(s) \u2208 GF }.\nFrom (iii) to (iv). A Gabriel filter is closed under bigger ideals and contains with J\nand I also JI. In particular, it contains arbitrary powers of I. Therefore, in the case of\na commutative noetherian ring, a Gabriel filter contains with an ideal also all ideals with\nthe same radical. Hence it corresponds to a Zariski filter.\nFrom (iv) to (i) follows from Proposition 6.1.6(iii) and Lemma 2.4.9.\nWe have to show that the constructions are inverse to each other. A left exact closure\noperation c yields the Zariski filter D(J), J c = R and the corresponding Grothendieck\ntopology, and we have to show that c = zftop \u2212 c. We can restrict to the closure of 0.\nIf s \u2208 0c , then s \u2208 TM , so Ann(s) \u2208 GF and so D(Ann(s)) \u2208 F . Since s|D(Ann(s)) = 0,\nwe have s \u2208 0zftop\u2212c . If s \u2208 0zftop\u2212c , then s|D(J) for some ideal J with J c = R. Then\nsupp(s) \u2229 D(J) = \u2205 and so D(J) \u2286 D(Ann(s)), hence Ann(s) \u2208 GF . Therefore Ann(s)c =\nR and R/ Ann(s) is a torsion module. We have R/ Ann(s) \u2212\n\u2192 M , 1 7\u2192 s, and 1 \u2208 0c\nc\nimplies by persistence that s \u2208 0 . The other directions are similar.\n\u0003\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n77\n\nExample 6.3.2. We give an example of a non-hereditary torsion theory [65, Example\n3.1(8)]. Consider the torsion theory for R -modules which is cogenerated by R. This means\nthat an R-module M is torsion if and only if HomR (M, R) = 0. If R is a domain, but not\na field, then HomR (Q(R), R) = 0, so the quotient field is torsion, but the submodule R \u2282\nQ(R) is not-torsion, so the hereditary property does not hold. This torsion theory does\nnot fulfill the first finiteness condition 2.2.14, so it can not be induced by a quasicompact\nGrothendieck topology by Corollary 2.4.7.\n6.4. The divisorial topology, reflexive hull and symbolic powers.\nIn this section we deal with the following special case of Example 6.1.5.\nDefinition 6.4.1. Let X be a scheme and let X (1) be its points of height at most one.\nThe Grothendieck topology on X, where\nthe open sets are the Zariski open sets and where\nS\nUi \u2212\n\u2192 U , i \u2208 I, is a covering if U (1) \u2286 i\u2208I Ui , is called the divisorial topology, denoted by\nXdiv .\nWe will relate the divisorial topology with symbolic powers of ideals and with the\nreflexive hull of a module. Recall that the dual of an R-module is M \u2228 = HomR (M, R) and\nthat the bidual of a module M is M \u2228\u2228 . We denote the natural homomorphism M \u2212\n\u2192 M \u2228\u2228\ngiven by s 7\u2192 (\u03c6 7\u2192 \u03c6(s)) by \u03b8. M is called torsionless if \u03b8 is injective and reflexive if \u03b8\nis bijective; see [10, 1.4] for these definitions. For a domain R a finite torsion-free (with\nrespect to non-zero divisors, see Example 6.1.9) module M is also torsionless.\nLemma 6.4.2. Let R be a noetherian normal domain and let M be a finite torsion-free\nR-module. Then \u0393(Rdiv , Mdiv ) = M \u2228\u2228 , the reflexive hull of M .\nProof. We have a natural R-module homomorphism\nM \u2212\u2192\n\nlim \u0393(V, M ) = \u0393(Rdiv , Mdiv ) .\n\u2212\u2192\n\nX (1) \u2286V\n\nWe first claim that the colimit on the right is reflexive, using [10, Proposition 1.4.1(b)].\nFor prime ideals p with depth Rp \u2264 1 also the height is \u2264 1 (as R is normal) and so Rp is\na field or a discrete valuation domain. Hence Mp is free, since it is torsion-free, and so it\nis reflexive.\nLet now p be a prime ideal with depth Rp \u2265 2 and let t1 , t2 \u2208 R be a regular sequence\nin Rp . We have to show that they are a regular sequence for M as well. Let s1 , s2 be two\nsections of the colimit and suppose that t1 s1 + t2 s2 = 0. We may assume that s1 , s2 \u2208\n\u0393(V, M ), that V \u2286 D(t1 , t2 ) and that the equation holds over V . Then st21 = \u2212 st12 =: s is\na global element of \u0393(V, M ) and hence s1 = t2 s.\nThe reflexivity implies that we get a homomorphism M \u2228\u2228 \u2212\n\u2192 \u0393(Rdiv , Mdiv ). There\nexists an open subset W \u2287 X (1) where M |W is locally free, since Mp is free for every\nprime ideal of height one. Hence the colimit equals \u0393(W, M ) and it is a finite R-module.\nA homomorphism between two finite reflexive R-modules is by [61, Lemma 24.2] a bijection\nif this is true after localization at every prime ideal of height one. For such a prime ideal\nwe have (limX (1) \u2286V \u0393(V, M ))p = limp\u2208V \u0393(V, M ) = Mp = (M \u2228\u2228 )p .\n\u0003\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\nWe come to the closure operation induced by the divisorial topology.\n\n\f78\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nProposition 6.4.3. Let R be a normal noetherian domain. The closure operation for\nfinite module N \u2286 M induced by the divisorial topology is the ('internal') reflexive hull,\nnamely\nN div\u2212c = {s \u2208 M : \u03b8(s) \u2208 N \u2228\u2228 ( inside M \u2228\u2228 )} .\nFor submodules of a finite reflexive module, the closure is the reflexive hull N \u2228\u2228 . For\nideals I \u2286 R we have\nI div\u2212c = R \u2229\n\n\\\n\nIRp\nprime of height one\n= {f \u2208 R : \u03bdp (f ) \u2265 min{\u03bdp (g) : g \u2208 I} for all p of height one} ,\nI\u2286p\n\nwhere \u03bdp denotes the corresponding discrete valuation. In particular, for a prime ideal p\nof height one we have (pn )div\u2212c = p(n) , the nth symbolic power of p. For ideals I \u2286 R of\nheight \u2265 2 we have I div\u2212c = R.\nProof. The inclusion N \u2286 M yields by left exactness (Proposition 6.1.6(iii)) an inclusion\nNdiv \u2286 Mdiv of sheaves in the divisorial topology. The modules of global sections are by\nLemma 6.4.2 \u0393(Rdiv , Ndiv ) = N \u2228\u2228 \u2286 \u0393(Rdiv , Mdiv ) = M \u2228\u2228 . For M reflexive we have the\ninclusions N \u2286 N \u2228\u2228 \u2286 M \u2228\u2228 = M .\nT\nBy Proposition 6.1.6(v) we have I div\u2212c = R \u2229 p prime of height one IRp , and we can\nskip the prime ideals which do not contain I. The extended ideal IRp for a prime ideal p\nof height one equals (pRp )\u03bd for \u03bd = min{\u03bdp (g) : g \u2208 I}, which gives the second equality.\nAlso, pn \u2286 p is the only minimal prime ideal, and p(n) = R \u2229 pn Rp is by definition the n-th\nsymbolic power of p [12, Section 3.9]. Finally, if I has height \u2265 2, meaning that every\nminimal prime ideal of I has height \u2265 2, then the index set is empty.\n\u0003\nProposition 6.4.4. Let X be a normal noetherian integral scheme endowed with the\ndivisorial topology, let Q = Q(X) be its function field. Then the following holds.\n(i) The coherent submodules of Q in the divisorial topology are all invertible and are\nin one to one correspondence with Weil divisors. The coherent ideal sheaves correspond to effective Weil divisors.\n\u00d7\n) = Cl X, the divisor class group of X (compare [22, Propo(ii) We have H 1 (Xdiv , Odiv\nsition XI.3.7.1]).\nProof. (i). By coherent we mean here just coherent as a module in the Zariski topology.\nLet L \u2286 Q be a coherent submodule. For p \u2208 X of height one the localization Lp \u2286 Q is\nfree of rank one, and by coherence there exists an open affine neighborhood p \u2208 U such that\nL|U is free (in the Zariski topology and in the divisorial topology). These neighborhoods\ndo cover X in the divisorial topology (not necessarily in the Zariski topology), hence L is\ninvertible. In general, a Weil divisor corresponds to an invertible submodule of Q on some\nopen subset V \u2287 X (1) . So the result follows.\n(ii).

It defines clearly a submodule which is invertible in codimension one. On\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n79\n\nthe other hand, a Weil divisor corresponds to such a submodule L \u2286 Q, and L is for every\nx \u2208 X (1) generated by qx \u2208 Q, and this is true in a neighborhood of x. The union of\nthese neighborhoods together is then an open set V \u2287 X (1) . This gives an identification\nDivX = limX (1) \u2286V \u0393(V, Q\u00d7 /O\u00d7 ). So the written down cohomology sequences is just the\n\u2212\u2192\ndefining sequence of the divisor class group [27, Section II.6].\n\u0003\n7. Further examples\n7.1. Completion.\nAlso the completion of a ring with respect to an ideal may be considered as given a\nGrothendieck topology, but quite in a different flavor. In particular the coverings there\nare not coverings in the set-theoretical sense, and it is not a single-handed Grothendieck\ntopology nor a quasicompact one.\nLet R denote a commutative ring and a \u2286 R an ideal. We consider the category over\nX = Spec R consisting of X and of all Xk := Spec R/ak , k \u2265 0, and all X-morphisms.\nThe coverings in this topology are given by families which contain the identity (Xk \u2212\n\u2192 Xk\nor X \u2212\n\u2192 X) and by families which contain Xk \u2212\n\u2192 X, k \u2208 I \u2286 N, where I is infinite.\nWe denote this Grothendieck topology by Xa\u2212top (similar definitions are possible for ideal\nfamilies ak , k \u2208 N, with a0 = R and ak *al \u2286 ak+l ; one can also formulate scheme versions).\nAn R-module M defines the presheaf M pre by\n\u0393(Xk , M pre ) := M \u2297R R/ak = M/ak M .\n\nProposition 7.1.1.

This is exactly the compatibility condition in the\ntopology. (ii) is clear.\n(iii) For k \u2264 l we have ak \u2287 al , hence R/al \u2212\n\u2192 R/ak and so Xk \u2212\n\u2192 Xl . As Xk \u2212\n\u2192X\nare not covers, this filter is not absolute. Since \u2205 = Spec R/a0 is the initial object of the\nfilter, all stalks are 0.\n\n\f80\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\n(iv) The only single cover of X is the identity, so the filter is clearly absolute. The\ncovering Xk \u2212\n\u2192 X, k \u2208 N, is such that the identity X \u2212\n\u2192 X factors through no Xk , hence\nthis filter is not irreducible (Definition 1.8.1). (v) and (vi) are clear.\n\u0003\n7.2. Proper topology.\nProper topologies seem to have first been considered by S.-I. Kimura [42, Definition 3.1]\nin order to give a cohomological characterization of Alexander schemes. Here we treat the\nproper topology in its relation to the integral closure of ideals.\nDefinition 7.2.1. Let X be a scheme. Let TX denote the category of all schemes over\nX and define a covering to be a proper surjective morphism V \u2212\n\u2192 U (we do not insist\nthat the structure morphisms are proper). We denote X endowed with this Grothendieck\ntopology by Xprop .\nRemark 7.2.2. Recall that a proper morphism is separated, of finite type and universally\nclosed [27, Section II.4]. Proper morphisms are stable under base change and under composition, hence we get indeed a Grothendieck topology. Note that the proper topology is\nnot an affine topology and that it is not a refinement of the (single-handed) Zariski topology. Every scheme morphism induces a site morphism in the proper topology. The proper\ntopology is a refinement of the finite topology. A proper and surjective homomorphism is\nuniversally submersive.\nImportant examples of proper morphisms are given by blow-ups of ideals, see [18,\nD\u00e9fintion 8.1.3] or [27, Propositions II.7.10, II.7.13]. Recall that the blow-up of an ideal\nH \u2286 R is given by XH = Proj BH , BH = \u2295k\u2208N H k . We characterize first which blow-ups\nyield surjective morphisms.\nLemma 7.2.3. A blow-up XH \u2212\u2192 X = Spec R of an ideal H \u2286 R in a noetherian ring is\nsurjective if and only if H is not contained in any minimal prime ideal of R.\nProof. Let Xi = Spec Ri denote the integral components of Spec R. If H is not contained\nin the minimal prime q, then the extended ideal in R/q is not the 0-ideal. For a domain\nthe blow-up of a non-zero ideal defines a surjective morphism, since the image is closed\nand the morphism is an isomorphism on a non-empty open set [27, Proposition II.7.13].\nSince the blow-up of the component factors through XH \u00d7X Xi [27, Corollary II.7.15], it\nfollows that the morphism is surjective on every component, hence surjective.\nS\nOn the other hand, if HRi = 0, then over the open set Ui = Xi \u2212 j6=i Xj we have\nXH \u00d7X Ui = (Ui )H|Ui = \u2205.\n\u0003\n\nThe extended ideal of I \u2286 R under a scheme morphism Y \u2212\n\u2192 Spec R is on every affine\nsubset V = Spec S \u2286 Y given by IS. This gives an ideal sheaf on Y . The following lemma\nis motivated by Ratliff's \u25b3-closure, see Section 7.3.\n\nLemma 7.2.4. Let R denote a noetherian ring and suppose that f H \u2286 IH, where f \u2208 R\nand where I and H are ideals. Then f belongs to the extended ideal of I under the blow-up\nXH \u2212\u2192 X.\n\nProof. Set I = (f1 , . . . , fn ) and H = (h1 , . . . , hP\nm ). The condition f H \u2286 IH means\nexplicitly that for every hi we may write f hi = 1\u2264r\u2264n,1\u2264s\u2264m arsi fr hs , arsi \u2208 R. This\ntranslates to\nn X\nm\nX\narsi hs\n)fr in (BH )hi ,\nf=\n(\nhi\nr=1 s=1\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n81\n\nso f \u2208 I((BH )hi )0 for i = 1, . . . , m. This means that f belongs to the extended ideal of\nI on D+ (hi ) \u2286 XH . These open sets cover XH , therefore f belongs also globally to the\nextended ideal on XH .\n\u0003\nProposition 7.2.5. Let X = Spec R denote an affine scheme endowed with the proper\ntopology. Then the closure induced by this topology is the integral closure.\nProof. Assume first that f belongs to the extended ideal IOY for a proper surjective\nmorphism Y \u2212\n\u2192 X. Such a morphism is universally submersive [4]. Under the base\nchange \u03b3 : Spec V \u2212\n\u2192 X, where V is a discrete valuation domain, the image \u03b3 \u2217 (f ) is\nalso in the extended ideal of IOV in YV . Thus we may assume that R = V is a discrete\nvaluation domain with local parameter \u03c0, that f = \u03c0 n and I = (\u03c0 m ). Then by [4] it\nfollows that there exists a discrete valuation domain W such that Spec W \u2212\n\u2192Y \u2212\n\u2192 V is\nsurjective, which shows that f \u2208 I = I.\nSuppose now that\nf \u2208 I. Let Xj = Spec Rj , j \u2208 J, denote the integral components of\nU\nX. The morphism Xj \u2212\n\u2192 X is proper and surjective. We will construct Y \u2212\n\u2192 X proper\nand surjective on each component Xj separately according to whether the extended ideal\nIOXj is 0 or not. In the first case we also have fj = 0, and we do not need to modify Xj .\nSo suppose that I extends to a non-zero ideal in Rj , or that R is a domain and I 6= 0.\nWe use the theory of reductions, see [38, Chapter 5]. If f \u2208 I, then I is a reduction of\nL = (I, f ), that is, Lr+1 = ILr for some r. So in particular f Lr \u2286 ILr . Hence f belongs\nto the extended ideal of the blow-up along the ideal Lr by Lemma 7.2.4. Since L 6= 0, this\nblow-up is a surjection.\n\u0003\nRemark 7.2.6. This result is related to the known fact that f belongs to the integral\nclosure of an ideal I in a domain if and only if it belongs to the extended ideal in the\nnormalization of the blow-up of I, see [13, Proposition 1.4].\n7.3. The \u25b3-closure of Ratliff.\n\nIn [55], Ratliff introduced the concept of the \u25b3-closure of an ideal (see also [57] and\n[58]). Here \u25b3 is a fixed multiplicatively closed set of ideals in a commutative ring R and\nthe closure operation for an ideal I \u2286 R is given by\nI\u25b3 =\n\n[\n\n(IH : H) .\n\nH\u2208\u25b3\n\nThus an element f \u2208 R belongs to I\u25b3 if and only if there exists an ideal H \u2208 \u25b3 such that\nf H \u2286 IH. Under mild conditions the \u25b3-closure lies inside the integral closure (see [55,\nTheorem 3.2] or Proposition 7.3.6 below).\nWe will translate this closure operation into our language and we will show how some\nof Ratliff's basic results follow immediately. It will turn out that the most natural\nGrothendieck topology to induce the \u25b3-closure is given by certain non-affine proper mappings. The basic relationship is given by the following proposition (compare with [29, Fact\n2.1] for the case of the Ratliff-Rush closure).\nProposition 7.3.1. Let R denote a commutative noetherian ring,\nlet \u25b3 be a multiplicaL\ntively closed collection of ideals in R. Let XH = Proj BH ,BH = k\u2208N H k , H \u2208 \u25b3, denote\nthe corresponding blow-ups. Then an element f \u2208 R belongs to Ratliff 's \u25b3-closure of an\nideal I \u2286 R, i.e. f \u2208 I\u25b3 , if and only if f belongs for some XH \u2212\u2192 X = Spec R, H \u2208 \u25b3,\nto the extended ideal of I.\n\n\f82\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nProof. Set I = (f1 , . . . , fn ). Suppose first that f \u2208 I\u25b3 , so that there exists an ideal H \u2208 \u25b3\nwith f H \u2286 IH. Then f belongs to the extended ideal under the blow-up XH \u2212\n\u2192 X by\nLemma 7.2.4.\nFor the other direction suppose that f belongs to the extended ideal of I under the blowup XH \u2212\n\u2192 X, H = (h1 , . . . , hm ). This means that we have locally f \u2208 I on the affine\nP\nb\ncovering sets D+ (hi ), that is, f \u2208 I((BH )hi )0 . This means explicitly that f = nj=1 tijij fj ,\nhi\n\nwhere bij \u2208 H tij . Hence there exists also a t such that f hti \u2208 IH t for all i. It follows that\nf H mt \u2286 IH mt , since for a monomial h\u03bd11 * * * h\u03bdmm \u2208 H mt we have \u03bdi \u2265 t for some i and\nhence\nf h\u03bd11 * * * h\u03bdmm = f hti h\u03bd11 * * * h\u03bdi i \u2212t * * * h\u03bdmm \u2208 IH t * H mt\u2212t \u2286 IH mt .\nSince \u25b3 is multiplicatively closed we have H mt \u2208 \u25b3 and we get f \u2208 I\u25b3 .\n\u0003\nDefinition 7.3.2. Let X denote a scheme and let \u25b3 denote a multiplicatively closed set\nof ideal sheaves. For \u03c8 : Y \u2212\n\u2192 X denote the set of extended ideal sheaves HOY , H \u2208 \u25b3,\nby \u25b3Y . Then the \u25b3-topology on X is given by the full category of schemes of finite type\nover X, and we declare Z \u2212\n\u2192 Y to be a cover if there exists a factorization YH \u2212\n\u2192Z\u2212\n\u2192Y,\nwhere H \u2208 \u25b3Y and where YH \u2212\n\u2192 Y is the blow-up of HOY .\nRemark 7.3.3. If YH \u2212\n\u2192Z\u2212\n\u2192 Y is a covering and U \u2212\n\u2192 Y an X-morphism, then we get\na factorization UH \u2212\n\u2192 YH \u00d7 Y U \u2212\n\u2192 Z \u00d7Y U \u2212\n\u2192 U by the universal property of blow-up\n[27, Proposition 7.14]. Hence the pull-back of a covering is a covering. If Z \u2212\n\u2192 Y and\nW \u2212\n\u2192 Z are coverings with factorizations YH \u2212\n\u2192Z \u2212\n\u2192 Y and ZG \u2212\n\u2192W \u2212\n\u2192 Z, then we\nget YHG \u223c\n\u2192 ZG , which shows that the composition of coverings is a covering. So\n= (YH )G \u2212\nwe have indeed a Grothendieck topology.\nCorollary 7.3.4. Let R denote a noetherian commutative ring and let \u25b3 denote a multiplicatively closed set of ideals. Then the \u25b3-closure equals the closure induced by the\n\u25b3-topology on X = Spec R.\nProof. This follows immediately from Lemma 2.4.4, Proposition 7.3.1 and Definition 7.3.2.\n\u0003\nProposition 7.3.5. Let \u03c6 : Y\u25b3\u2032 \u2212\u2192 X\u25b3 be a scheme morphism such that HOY \u2208 \u25b3\u2032\nfor all ideal sheaves H \u2208 \u25b3. Then \u03c6 induces a site morphism in the \u25b3-topology. In\nparticular, the persistence property holds for the \u25b3-closure for these morphisms (as stated\nin [55, Theorem 5.1]).\nProof. If V \u2212\n\u2192 X is a covering with factorization XH \u2212\n\u2192V \u2212\n\u2192 X, then the factorization\nYH \u2212\n\u2192 XH \u00d7X Y \u2212\n\u2192 U \u00d7X Y \u2212\n\u2192 Y shows that the pull-back is also a covering. The\nsecond statement follows from Theorem 2.4.8.\n\u0003\nProposition 7.3.6. Let R denote a noetherian ring and let \u25b3 denote the set of all ideals\nwhich are not contained in any minimal prime ideal. Then for every ideal I \u2208 \u25b3 we have\nI\u25b3 = I, the integral closure of I.\n\nProof. Let f \u2208 I\u25b3 , and suppose that f belongs to the extended ideal of I under XH \u2212\n\u2192 X,\nH \u2208 \u25b3. This blow-up is surjective by Lemma 7.2.3, hence f belongs to the proper closure\nof I and hence to the integral closure by Proposition 7.2.5.\nOn the other hand, if f \u2208 I, then f belongs to the extended ideal of I under the blow-up\nof a power of (I, f ) as in the proof of Proposition 7.2.5.\n\u0003\n\n\fGROTHENDIECK TOPOLOGIES AND IDEAL CLOSURE OPERATIONS\n\n83\n\nRatliff also associates to a commutative ring endowed with \u25b3 another ring R\u25b3 , the \u25b3closure of the ring [55, Definition 6.2]. In the case where \u25b3 does not contain the zero-ideal\nand R is noetherian this is (see [55, Theorem 6.2])\nR\u25b3 = {c/b : b non-zero divisor and c \u2208 (b)\u25b3 } \u2286 Q(R) ,\nwhere Q(R) denotes the total quotient ring. We relate this construction to absolute stalks\nand rings of global sections in the \u25b3-topology.\nWe endow a given multiplicatively closed set \u25b3 of ideals with the structure of a cofiltered\nset by declaring that an arrow H \u2212\n\u2192 G exists if G extends to an invertible ideal in XH .\nIn this case there is a unique morphism XH \u2212\n\u2192 XG by [27, Proposition II.7.14].\nLemma 7.3.7. Let R denote a commutative ring, and let \u25b3 denote a multiplicatively\nclosed set of ideals. Then \u25b3 is a cofiltered set and \u25b3 \u2212\u2192 TX , H 7\u2192 XH , is an absolute\nfilter. If R \u2212\u2192 S is a ring homomorphism such that for every H \u2208 \u25b3 the extended ideal\nHS is invertible, then there exists a ring homomorphism limH\u2208\u25b3 \u0393(XH , O) \u2212\u2192 S.\n\u2212\u2192\n\nProof. Two arrows H \u2212\n\u2192 E, G \u2212\n\u2192 E have the common refinement HG, because in XHG\nboth H and G become invertible. Since there is at most one arrow, \u25b3 is cofiltered in the\nsense of Definition 1.2.1.\nBy the definition of a cover in the \u25b3-topology every morphism XH \u2212\n\u2192 X indexed by\nthis filter is a cover. If Y \u2212\n\u2192 XH is a cover, then there exists an ideal G \u2208 \u25b3 and a\nfactorization (XH )G \u2212\n\u2192Y \u2212\n\u2192 XH , and so this filter is absolute (Definition 1.9.1). The\ncorresponding absolute stalk of the structure sheaf is hence limH\u2208\u25b3 \u0393(XH , O).\n\u2212\u2192\nIf R \u2212\n\u2192 S is given and the extended ideal HS is invertible, then there exists a unique\nmorphism Spec S \u2212\n\u2192 XH and hence \u0393(XH , O) \u2212\n\u2192 S, which extends to a ring homomorphism limH\u2208\u25b3 \u0393(XH , O) \u2212\n\u2192 S.\n\u0003\n\u2212\u2192\n\nProposition 7.3.8. Let X = Spec R denote an affine scheme and let \u25b3 denote a multiplicatively closed set of ideals in R such that every H \u2208 \u25b3 contains a non-zero divisor.\nThen we have identities \u0393(X\u25b3 , O\u25b3 ) = limH\u2208\u25b3 \u0393(XH , O) = R\u25b3 .\n\u2212\u2192\n\nProof. We have natural homomorphisms \u0393(X\u25b3 , O\u25b3 ) \u2212\n\u2192 limH\u2208\u25b3 \u0393(XH , O) \u2212\n\u2192 Q(R),\n\u2212\u2192\nwhere the second homomorphism exists due to Lemma 7.3.7 applied to S = Q(R). The\nfirst homomorphism exists by Lemma 1.8.4 and is injective by Lemma 1.9.5. So let\nf \u2208 \u0393(XH , O), H \u2208 \u25b3, be given. The diagonal XH \u2212\n\u2192 XH \u00d7X XH is a cover in the\n\u25b3-topology, since we have a factorization (XH \u00d7X XH )H \u2212\n\u2192 XH \u2212\n\u2192 XH \u00d7X XH . Hence\nf is compatible (Lemma 1.6.7) and f \u2208 \u0393(X\u25b3 , O\u25b3 ).\nLet now c/b \u2208 Q(R) be such that c \u2208 (b)\u25b3 , say cH \u2286 bH, H = (h1 , . . . , hm ). This\nmeans that for every hi there exists gi \u2208 H such that chi = bgi . For i, j it follows\nthat bgi hj = chi hj = bgj hi and so gi hj = gj hi , since b is a non zero divisor. Therefore\ngi /hi = gj /hj in \u0393(D+ (hi hj ), O) and so we get a global element in \u0393(XH , O). This element\nmaps to c/b under the natural homomorphism.\nOn the other hand, suppose that c/b \u2208 Q(R) is the image of q \u2208 \u0393(XH , O), H \u2208 \u25b3,\nH = (h1 , . . . , hm ). Let h \u2208 H be a non zero divisor, and let q = g/hr \u2208 \u0393(D+ (h), O).\nThis maps to g/hr \u2208 Q(R) and so c/b = g/hr . So we may assume that b \u2208 H. We have\nc/b = gi /hi in \u0393(D+ (bhi ), O), and so chti \u2208 bH t for some t and all i. Then the ideal H tm\nshows that c \u2208 (b)\u25b3 (as in the proof of Proposition 7.3.1).\n\u0003\n\n\f84\n\nHOLGER BRENNER\n\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n[29]\n[30]\n[31]\n[32]\n[33]\n[34]\n[35]\n[36]\n\nM.
