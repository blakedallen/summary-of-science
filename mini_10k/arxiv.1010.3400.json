In this article we present some integrability conditions for partial difference\nequations obtained using the formal symmetries approach. We apply them to find integrable partial difference equations contained in a class of equations obtained by the\nmultiple scale analysis of the general multilinear dispersive difference equation defined\non the square.\n\n1. Introduction\nDL met Marcos Moshinsky for the first time on his arrival in Mexico in February 1973.\nHe went there with a two years fellowship of the CONACYT (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia\ny Tecnolog\u0131\u0301a), the Mexican Research Council. DL visit was part of his duties as military\nservice in Italy and was following a visit to Mexico in the summer of 1972 by Francesco\nCalogero, with whom he graduated at the University of Rome La Sapienza in the spring of\n1972 with a thesis on \"Computation of bound state energy for nuclei and nuclear matter\nwith One-Boson-Exchange Potentials\" [5].\nThe bureaucratic process, preliminary to this visit, was long and tiring and it was successful only for the strong concern of DL uncle, Enzo Levi, professor of Hydrulics at UNAM\n[9] and for the help of Marcos Moshinsky who signed a contract for him which, as DL uncle\nwrote, was ready to substain with his own personal funds if no other source could be found.\nDuring DL stay in Mexico he was able, with the help of Marcos, to appreciate the pleasures of research and to start his career in Mathematical Physics. With Marcos Moshinsky\nhe published, during the two years stay at the Instituto de Fisica of UNAM, 4 articles\n[6, 14, 7, 8] but he also collaborated with some of the other physicists of the Institute\n[4, 11, 12]. This visit was fundamental to shape DL future life, both from the personal\npoint of view and from the point of view of his career.\nAfter 1975 DL met Marcos Moshinsky frequently both abroad and in Mexico. When\nDL was in Mexico, Marcos Moshinsky always invited him to his home to partecipate to his\nfamily dinners. As a memento of Marcos, let us add a picture of his with Pavel Winternitz,\nPetra Seligman and Decio Levi, taken in September 1999 in front of the Guest House of\nthe CIC-AC where he stayed overnight after a seminar given at the Instituto de Fisica of\nUNAM, Cuernavaca branch.\nSymmetries have played always an important role in physics and in the research of\nMarcos Moshinsky. This presentation shows how crucial can be the notion of symmetry in\nuncovering integrable structures in nonlinear partial difference equations.\nThe discovery of new integrable Partial Difference Equations (P \u2206E) is always a very\nchallenging problem as, by proper continuous limits, we can obtain integrable Differential\nDifference Equations (D\u2206E) and Partial Differential Equations (P DE).\nA very successful way to uncover integrable P DE has been the formal symmetry approach\ndue to Shabat and his school in Ufa [22]. These results have been later extended to the case\nof D\u2206E by Yamilov [31], a former student of Shabat.\nHere we present some results on the application of the formal symmetry technique to\nP \u2206E.\nThe basic theory for obtaining symmetries of differential equations has been introduced\nby Sophus Lie at the end of the nineteen century and can be found together with its\nextension to generalized symmetries introduced by Emma Noether, for example in the book\n1\n\n\f2\n\nD. LEVI AND R.I. YAMILOV\n\nFigure 1. Pavel Winternitz, Marcos Moshinsky, Petra Seligman and Decio Levi\nin front of the Guest House of CIC-AC in Cuernavaca in September 1999.\n\nby Olver [26]. The extension of the classical theory to P \u2206E can be found in the work of\nLevi and Winternitz [19, 21, 29].\nHere in the following we outline the results of the geometric classification of P \u2206E given\nby Adler, Bobenko and Suris [2] with some critical comments at the end. Then in Section 2\nwe derive the lowest integrability conditions starting from the request that the P \u2206E admit\ngeneralized symmetries of sufficiently high order. In Section 3 we show how the test can be\napplied. Then we apply it to a simple class of P \u2206E obtained by the multiple scale analysis\nof a generic multilinear dispersive equation defined on the square.\n1.1. Classification of linear affine discrete equations. Adler, Bobenko and Suris [2]\nconsidered the following class of autonomous P \u2206E:\nui+1,j+1 = F (ui+1,j , ui,j , ui,j+1 ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere i, j are arbitrary integers. Eq. (1) is a discrete analogue of the hyperbolic equations\nuxy = F (ux , u, uy ).\n\n(2)\n\nwhich are very important in many fields of physics. Up to now the general equation (2) has\nnot been classified. Only the two particular cases:\nuxy = F (u);\n\nux = F (u, v) , vy = G(u, v),\n\nwhich are essentially easier, have been classified by the formal symmetry approach [32, 33].\nThe ABS integrable lattice equations are defined as those autonomous affine linear (i.e.\npolynomial of degree one in each argument, i.e. multilinear) partial difference equations of\nthe form\nE(u0,0 , u1,0 , u0,1 , u1,1 ; \u03b1, \u03b2) = 0,\n(3)\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are two constant parameters , whose integrability is based on the consistency around a cube (or 3D-consistency). Here and in the following, as the equations are\nautonomous, and thus translational invariant, we skip the indices i and j and write the\nequations around the origin.\nThe main idea of the consistency method is the following:\n\n\fINTEGRABILITY TEST FOR DISCRETE EQUATIONS VIA GENERALIZED SYMMETRIES.3\n\nu0,1\n\nu1,1\n\n\u03b2\n\nu0,0\n\nu1,0\n\n\u03b1\n\nFigure 2.

Three-dimensional consistency\n\n(1) One starts from a square lattice and defines the three variables ui,j on the vertices\n(see Figure 2). By solving E = 0 one obtains a rational expression for the fourth\none.\n(2) One adjoins a third direction, say k, and imagines the map giving u1,1,1 as being\nthe composition of maps on the various planes. There exist three different ways\nto obtain u1,1,1 and the consistency constraint is that they all lead to the same\nresult.\n(3) Two further constraints have been introduced by Adler, Bobenko and Suris:\n\u2022 D4 -symmetry:\nE(u0,0 , u1,0 , u0,1 , u1,1 ; \u03b1, \u03b2)\n\n\u2022\n(4) The\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n=\n\n\u00b1E(u0,0 , u0,1 , u1,0 , u1,1 ; \u03b2, \u03b1)\n\n=\n\n\u00b1E(u1,0 , u0,0 , u1,1 , u0,1 ; \u03b1, \u03b2).\n\nTetrahedron property: u1,1,1 is independent of u0,0,0 .\nequations are classified according to the following equivalence group:\nA M\u00f6bius transformation.\nSimultaneous point change of all variables.\n\nAs a result of this procedure all equations possess a symmetric (in the exchange of the\nfirst to the second index) Lax pair, B\u00e4cklund transformations etc. . Thus the compatible\nequations are, for all purposes, completely integrable equations.\n\n\f4\n\nD. LEVI AND R.I.

(Q4) [24].\nThe symmetries for the discrete equations of the ABS list have been constructed [28, 27] and\nare given by D\u2206E, subcases of Yamilov's discretization of the Krichever\u2013Novikov equation\n(YdKN) [17, 31]:\nR(u1 , u0 , u\u22121 )\ndu0\n=\n,\nd\u000f\nu1 \u2212 u\u22121\n\nR(u1 , u0 , u\u22121 ) = A0 u1 u\u22121 + B0 (u1 + u\u22121 ) + C0 ,\n\nwhere\nA0 = c1 u20 + 2c2 u0 + c3 ,\nB0 = c2 u20 + c4 u0 + c5 ,\nC0 = c3 u20 + 2c5 u0 + c6 .\nIt is immediate to see that by defining vi = ui,j and \u1e7di = ui,j+1 , the equations of the ABS\nlist are nothing else but B\u00e4cklund transformations for particular subcases of the YdKN\n[13, 17]. The ABS equations do not exhaust all the possible B\u00e4cklund transformations for\nthe YdKN equation as the whole parameter space is not covered [17, 30]. Moreover, in the\nlist of integrable D\u2206E of Volterra type [31], there are equations different from the YdKN\nwhich may also have B\u00e4cklund transformations of the form (1). So we have space for new\nintegrable P \u2206E which we will search by using the formal symmetry approach. An extension\nof the 3D consistency approach has been proposed by the same authors [3] allowing different\nequations in the different faces of the cube. However in this way ABS were able to provide\nonly examples of new integrable P \u2206E but not to present a complete classification scheme.\n2. Construction of Integrability Conditions\nWe consider the class of autonomous P \u2206E\nu1,1 = f0,0 = F (u1,0 , u0,0 , u0,1 )\n\n(\u2202u1,0 F, \u2202u0,0 F, \u2202u0,1 F ) 6= 0.\n\n(6)\n\nIntroducing the two shifts operators, T1 and T2 such that T1 ui,j = ui+1,j , T2 ui,j = ui,j+1 ,\nit follows that the functions ui,j are related among themselves by eq. (6) and its shifted\nvalues\nui+1,j+1 = T1i T2j f0,0 = fi,j = F (ui+1,j , ui,j , ui,j+1 ).\n\n\fINTEGRABILITY TEST FOR DISCRETE EQUATIONS VIA GENERALIZED SYMMETRIES.5\n\nSo, the functions ui,j are not all independent. However we can introduce a set of independent\nfunctions ui,j in term of which all the others are expressed. A possible choice is given by\n(ui,0 , u0,j ), for any arbitrary i, j integers.\nA generalized symmetry, written in evolutionary form, is given by\nd\nu0,0 = g0,0 = G(un,0 , un\u22121,0 , . . . , un0 ,0 , u0,k , u0,k\u22121 , . . . , u0,k0 ), n \u2265 n0 , k \u2265 k 0 .\n(7)\ndt\nwhere t is the group parameter. By shifting, we can write it in any point of the plane\nd\nui,j = T1i T2j g0,0 = gi,j = G(ui+n,j , . . . , ui+n0 ,j , ui,j+k , . . . , ui,j+k0 ).\ndt\nIn term of the functions gi,j we can write down the symmetry invariant condition\n\u0015\n\u0014\ndf0,0\n= 0.\ng1,1 \u2212\ndt\nu1,1 =f0,0\n\n(8)\n\ni.e. g1,1 = (g1,0 \u2202u1,0 + g0,0 \u2202u0,0 + g0,1 \u2202u0,1 )f0,0 . This equation involves the independent\nvariables (ui,0 , u0,j ) appearing in g0,0 shifted to points laying on lines neighboring the axis,\ni.e. (ui,1 , u1,j ). For those function we can state the following Proposition [20], necessary to\nprove the subsequent Theorems:\nProposition 1.

The same can be said about the variables u0,j and the corresponding numbers k, k 0 if\n(gu0,k , gu0,k0 ) 6= 0.\nNow we can state the following Theorem, whose proof can be found in [20]:\nTheorem 1.

Thus, the assumption that a generalized symmetry exist implies the\nexistence of some conservation laws.\nIf we assume that a second generalized symmetry exists, i.e. we can find a nontrival\nfunction G\u0303 such that\nu0,0,t\u0303 = g\u03030,0 = G\u0303(u\u00f1,0 , u\u00f1\u22121,0 , . . . , u\u00f10 ,0 , u0,k\u0303 , u0,k\u0303\u22121 , . . . , u0,k\u03030 ),\nwhere \u00f1, \u00f10 , k\u0303, k\u0303 0 are its orders, then we can state the following Theorem:\n\n(14)\n\n\f6\n\nD. LEVI AND R.I. YAMILOV\n\nTheorem 2. Let the P \u2206E u1,1 = F possess two generalized symmetries of orders (n, n0 , k, k 0 )\nand (\u00f1, \u00f10 , k\u0303, k\u0303 0 ), u00,t = g00 and u00,t\u0303 = g\u030300 , and let their orders satisfy one of the following\nconditions:\nCase 1 : n > 0, \u00f1 = n + 1\nCase 2 : n0 < 0, \u00f10 = n0 \u2212 1\nCase 3 : k > 0, k\u0303 = k + 1\nCase 4 : k 0 < 0, k\u0303 0 = k 0 \u2212 1\nThen in correspondence with each of the previous cases the P \u2206E u1,1 = F admits a conservation law\n(m)\n(m)\n(T1 \u2212 1)p0,0 = (T2 \u2212 1)q0,0 ,\nm = 1, 2, 3, 4,\n(15)\nwhere\n(1)\n\np0,0 = log fu1,0 ,\n\n(2)\n\np0,0 = log\n\nfu0,0\n,\nfu0,1\n\n(3)\n\nq0,0 = log fu0,1 ,\n\n(4)\n\nq0,0 = log\n\nfu0,0\n.\nfu1,0\n\n(16)\n\nSo the assumption that the P \u2206E u1,1 = F have two generalized symmetries implies that\nwe must have four necessary conditions of integrability, i.e. there must exist some functions\n(1) (2) (3) (4)\n(1) (2) (3) (4)\nof finite range q0,0 , q0,0 , p0,0 , p0,0 satisfying the conservation laws (15) with p0,0 , p0,0 , q0,0 , q0,0\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\ndefined by eq. (16). q0,0 and q0,0 may depend only on the variables ui,0 , and p0,0 and p0,0\non u0,j .\nSummarizing the results up to now obtained we can say that a nonlinear partial difference\nequation will be considered to be integrable if it has a generalized symmetry of finite order,\ni.e. depending on a finite number of fields. This provide some conditions which imply the\n(m)\n(m)\nexistence of functions p0,0 or q0,0 of finite range whose existence is proved by solving a\ntotal difference.\nFor a D\u2206E, when all shifted variables are independent the proof that a total difference\nhas a solution depending on a finite number of fields, i.e. is a finite range function, is carried\nout by applying the discrete analogue of the variational derivative, i.e. a function qn is (up\nto a constant) a total difference of a function of finite range iff\nX\n\u03b4qn\n\u2202qn\n=\nT \u2212j\n= 0,\n(17)\n\u03b4un\n\u2202un+j\nj\nsee, e.g. [31]. For P \u2206E this is no more valid as the shifted variables are not independent\nas they are related by the nonlinear P \u2206E, in our case u1,1 = F (u1,0 , u0,0 , u0,1 ). This turns\nout to be the main problem for the application of the formal symmetry approach to P \u2206E.\nTo get a definite result we limit our considerations to five points generalized symmetries,\ni.e. when :\nu\u03070,0 = g0,0 = G(u1,0 , u\u22121,0 , u0,0 , u0,1 , u0,\u22121 ),\n\ngu1,0 gu\u22121,0 gu0,1 gu0,\u22121 6= 0.\n\n(18)\n\nThe existence of a 5 points generalized symmetry will be taken by us as an integrability\ncriterion. This may be a severe restriction as there might be integrable equations with\nsymmetries depending on more lattice points. However just in this case we are able to\nget sufficiently easily a definite result and, as will be shown in the next Section, we can\neven solve a classification problem. In this case we can state the following Theorem, which\nspecifies the results obtained so far to the case of five point symmetries:\nTheorem 3. If the P \u2206E u1,1 = F possesses a 5 points generalized symmetry, then the\nfunctions\n(m)\nq0,0 = Q(m) (u2,0 , u1,0 , u0,0 ),\nm = 1, 2,\n(19)\n(m)\np0,0 = P (m) (u0,2 , u0,1 , u0,0 ),\nm = 3, 4,\nmust satisfy the conditions (15, 16).\nThen, using the relations (10\u201313) with n = k = 1 and n0 = k 0 = \u22121, we get the following relations between the solutions of the total difference conditions and the generalized\nsymmetry G:\n(1)\n(2)\nq0,0 = \u2212T1 log G,u1,0 ,\nq0,0 = T1 log G,u\u22121,0 ,\n(20)\n(3)\n(4)\np0,0 = \u2212T2 log G,u0,1 ,\np0,0 = T2 log G,u0,\u22121 .\n\n\fINTEGRABILITY TEST FOR DISCRETE EQUATIONS VIA GENERALIZED SYMMETRIES.7\n\nSo, to prove the integrability, which for us means find a generalized 5 point symmetry, for\na nonlinear P \u2206E u11 = F , we have to check the integrability conditions (15, 16). If they\n(m)\n(m)\nare satisfied, i.e. there exist some finite range functions q0,0 and p0,0 , we can construct\nthe partial derivatives of G. The compatibility of these partial derivatives of G, given by\neqs. (20), provides the additional integrability condition\nG,u1,0 ,u\u22121,0 = G,u\u22121,0 ,u1,0 ,\n\nG,u0,1 ,u0,\u22121 = G,u0,\u22121 ,u0,1 .\n\n(21)\n\nIf these additional integrability conditions are satisfied, we find g0,0 up to an arbitrary\nunknown function of the form \u03bd(u0,0 ), which may correspond to a Lie point symmetry.\nThis function can be specified, using the determining equations (8).\nThe 5 point generalized symmetry g0,0 , so obtained, will be of the form:\ng0,0 = \u03a6(u1,0 , u0,0 , u\u22121,0 ) + \u03a8(u0,1 , u0,0 , u0,\u22121 ) + \u03bd(u0,0 ).\n\n(22)\n\n3. Application of the test: an example\nTo check the integrability conditions (15, 16) we need to find the finite range functions\n(m)\n(m = 1, 2) and p0,0 (m = 3, 4). This is not an easy task even if they are linear first\norder difference equations. A solution always exists but nothing ensure us a priory that\nthe solution is a finite range function. So let us present a scheme for solving explicitly\nthe integrability conditions we found for the equations on the square i.e. for finding the\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\nfunctions q0,0 , q0,0 , p0,0 and p0,0 .\nAs an example of this procedure let us consider the solution of eq. (15) for m = 1, where\n\n(m)\nq0,0\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\np0,0 = log(fu1,0 ), q0,0 = Q(1) (u2,0 , u1,0 , u0,0 ), T2 q0,0 = Q(1) (u2,1 , u1,1 , u0,1 ).\n\n(23)\n\nIn eq. (23) we have the dependent variables u2,1 and u1,1 where u2,1 = F (u2,0 , u1,0 , u1,1 )\nwhile u1,1 = F (u1,0 , u0,0 , u0,1 ). So eq. (15) for m = 1 will contain the unknow function\nF which characterize the class of equations we are considering twice, one time to calculate\nu1,1 in terms of independent variables and then to calculate u2,1 in term of u1,1 and of the\nindependent variables. This double dependence makes the calculations extremely difficult.\nTo overcome this difficulty we take into account that we are considering autonomous equations which are shift invariant. So we can substitute eq. (15) for m = 1 with the following\nequivalent independent equations\n(m)\n\n(m)\n\np0,0 \u2212 p\u22121,0\n(m)\np0,\u22121\n\n\u2212\n\n(m)\np\u22121,\u22121\n\n= Q(m) (u1,1 , u0,1 , u\u22121,1 ) \u2212 Q(m) (u1,0 , u0,0 , u\u22121,0 )\n(m)\n\n=Q\n\n(m)\n\n(u1,0 , u0,0 , u\u22121,0 ) \u2212 Q\n\n(24)\n\n(u1,\u22121 , u0,\u22121 , u\u22121,\u22121 )\n\n(25)\n\nwhere, to simplify the notation, we introduce in the following the functions\nu\u22121,1 = f (\u22121,1) (u\u22121,0 , u0,0 , u0,1 ),\n\nu1,1 = f (1,1) (u1,0 , u0,0 , u0,1 ),\n\nu\u22121,\u22121 = f (\u22121,\u22121) (u\u22121,0 , u0,0 , u0,\u22121 ),\n\nu1,\u22121 = f (1,\u22121) (u1,0 , u0,0 , u0,\u22121 ),\n\nto indicate f0,0 and its analogues. Moreover, we introduce the following two differential\noperators\n(\u22121,1)\n\n(1,1)\n\nA\n\n= \u2202u0,0 \u2212\n\nfu0,0\n\n(1,1)\n\nfu1,0\n\n\u2202u1,0 \u2212\n\nfu0,0\n\n(1,\u22121)\n\nB\n\n=\n\n\u2202u0,0 \u2212\n\n(\u22121,1)\n\nfu\u22121,0\n\n\u2202u\u22121,0 ,\n\n(26)\n\n(\u22121,\u22121)\n\nfu0,0\n\nfu0,0\n\nfu1,0\n\nfu\u22121,0\n\n\u2202\n\u2212\n(1,\u22121) u1,0\n\n(\u22121,\u22121)\n\n\u2202u\u22121,0 .\n\nin such a way that the functional equations (24, 25) reduce to differential monomials [1]:\nBQ(m) (u1,\u22121 , u0,\u22121 , u\u22121,\u22121 ) = 0,\n\nAQ(m) (u1,1 , u0,1 , u\u22121,1 ) = 0,\n(m)\n\nAQ\n\n(u1,0 , u0,0 , u\u22121,0 ) = r\n\n(m,1)\n\n,\n\n(m)\n\nBQ\n\n(u1,0 , u0,0 , u\u22121,0 ) = r\n\n(m,2)\n\n.\n\n(27)\n(28)\n\nEqs. (27) are, by construction, identically satisfied while eqs. (28) provide a set of equations for the derivatives of Q(m) (u1,0 , u0,0 , u\u22121,0 ) with respect to its three arguments. By\n\n\f8\n\nD. LEVI AND R.I. YAMILOV\n\ncommuting the two operators (26) we can obtain a third equation for the derivatives of\nQ(m) (u1,0 , u0,0 , u\u22121,0 ) with respect to its three arguments:\n[A, B] Q(m) (u1,0 , u0,0 , u\u22121,0 ) = r(m,3) .\n\n(29)\n\nEqs. (28, 29), if independent, define uniquely the derivatives of the function Q(m) (u1,0 , u0,0 , u\u22121,0 )\nand, if their consistency is satisfied, from them we get the functions themselves.\n(m)\n(m)\nIn a similar manner from (T1 \u2212 1)p0,0 = (T2 \u2212 1)q0,0 with m = 3, 4 we get the function\n(m)\n\np0,0 = P (m) (u0,2 , u0,1 , u0,0 ) and consequently the symmetry (22).\nThis procedure works if the function F is known, i.e. if we check a given equation for\nits integrability. It also works if F is known up to some unknown arbitrary constants to be\nspecified. In such case we solve a classification problem with unknown constants. However,\nthe problem is much more difficult if F depends on unknown arbitrary functions of one,\ntwo or three variables. In such a case the coefficients of the operators (26) and functions\nr(m,k) will depend on unknown functions, and r(m,k) may even depend on the composition\nof unknown functions. In this case a more complicated procedure might be necessary.\n3.1. A concrete example. Let us consider the following P \u2206E [10]\n2(u0,0 + u1,1 )\n\n+\n\nu1,0 + u0,1 + \u03b3[4u0,0 u1,1 + 2u1,0 u0,1 + 3(u0,0 + u1,1 )(u1,0 + u0,1 )] +\n(30)\n\n+\n\n(\u03be2 + \u03be4 )u0,0 u1,1 (u1,0 + u0,1 ) + (\u03be2 \u2212 \u03be4 )u1,0 u0,1 (u0,0 + u1,1 ) +\n\n+\n\n\u03b6u0,0 u1,1 u1,0 u0,1 = 0.\n\nEq. (30) is a dispersive multi\u2013linear partial difference equation which passes the A3 multiple\nscales integrability test [18]. Applying the M\u00f6bious transformation ui,j = 1/(\u00fbi,j \u2212 \u03b3) we\ncan rewrite it in a simplified form as\n(u0,0 u1,1 + \u03b1)(u1,0 + u0,1 ) + (2u1,0 u0,1 + \u03b2)(u0,0 + u1,1 ) + \u03b4 = 0,\n\n(31)\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b4 are well defined functions of \u03b3, \u03be2 , \u03be4 and \u03b6. We now apply to eq.\n(31) the procedure outlined at the beginning of this section. Eq. (31) depends on three\nfree parameters and we look for conditions on the three parameters, if any, such that the\nequation admits generalized symmetries. We get that the conditions are satisfied only in\ntwo cases:\n(1) \u03b1 = 2\u03b2 6= 0, \u03b4 = 0 and, as \u03b2 6= 0 we can always set \u03b2 = 1. This choice of the\nparameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 corresponds to \u03be2 = 3\u03be4 + 3\u03b3 2 and \u03b6 = 12\u03b3\u03be4 in eq. (30). The\ncorresponding integrable P \u2206E reads:\n(u0,0 u1,1 + 2)(u1,0 + u0,1 ) + (2u1,0 u0,1 + 1)(u0,0 + u1,1 ) = 0.\nIn correspondence with the eq.

This choice of the\nparameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 corresponds to \u03be2 = 6\u03b3 2 \u2212 3\u03be4 and \u03b6 = 12\u03b3(\u03b3 2 \u2212 \u03be4 ) in eq. (30).\nThe corresponding integrable P \u2206E reads:\n(1 + u0,0 u1,1 )(u1,0 + u0,1 ) + 2(1 + u0,1 u1,0 )(u0,0 + u1,1 ) = 0.\nIn correspondence with the eq. (34) we get the generalized symmetry\nu0,1 \u2212 u0,\u22121\nu1,0 \u2212 u\u22121,0\nu0,0;t = A(u20,0 \u2212 1)\n+ B(u20,0 \u2212 1)\nu\u22121,0 u1,0 \u2212 1\nu0,\u22121 u0,1 \u2212 1\n\n(34)\n\n(35)\n\nHere A, B are constant coefficients, and in both cases, (A = 0, B 6= 0) and (A 6= 0, B = 0),\nthe nonlinear D\u2206E (33, 35) are, up to a point transformation, equations belonging to the\nclassification of Volterra type equations done by Yamilov [31]. This shows that the eqs.\n(32, 34) do not belong to the ABS classification.
