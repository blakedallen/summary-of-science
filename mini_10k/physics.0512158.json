Highly successful students, as measured by grades and by scores on the Force Concept\nInventory, still struggle with fundamental concepts in mathematics and physics. These difficulties, which turn physics into parrot learning and include confusing velocity and acceleration or\nbeing unable to reason with graphs, are revealed by problems requiring estimation and conceptual\nreasoning. I discuss these problems, the difficulties that they reveal, and suggest possible remedies.\nI gave tutorials to ten students taking the first-year (IA) physics course at Cambridge University.\nThe students \u2013 diligent, curious, and a joy to teach \u2013 had studied physics in high school for years and,\nas measured by grades and by scores on the Force Concept Inventory, with great success. However,\nusing problems requiring estimation and conceptual reasoning (collected in the Appendix), I found\nthat they struggle with fundamental concepts in mathematics and physics. These difficulties \u2013 such\nas confusing velocity and acceleration or being unable to reason with graphs \u2013 prevent them from\nunderstanding or appreciating the beauty of physics, and force them into rote or parrot learning.\nPhysics becomes a game of memory and formula juggling. We can avoid this disastrous result by\nteaching students how physicists think: how we approximate and reason in unfamiliar situations.\nSection 4 contains suggestions in this direction.\n1 Physics difficulties\nStudents live in the pre-Newtonian world and do not understand acceleration; they confuse Newton's second law and third laws; they find circular motion confusing; and they cannot make or\nreason with freebody diagrams (diagrams of one object \u2013 the free body \u2013 in which every other\nobject is replaced by a force on the free body).\nSuch difficulties go unnoticed because students can solve many standard problems in spite\nof the difficulties; they are talented and have memorized rules that are often true. For example,\nstudents know that in circular motion some force will be F = mv 2 /r, if only because that formula\nis highlighted in the textbook section on circular motion. They are not sure of the force's direction\nor cause, but problems often specify F , m, and r, and ask for v. Simple algebra yields v, whether\nor not the student understands the cause or direction of the force.\nCopyright c 1998\u20132005 by Sanjoy Mahajan.

See the file COPYING in the source code.\n\n1\n\n\f1.1 Aristotelian thinking: The Force Concept Inventory\nPerhaps the most fundamental physics misconception is confusion acceleration with velocity: Students believe that zero velocity implies zero acceleration and therefore zero net force. This belief\nis an example of Aristotelian, or more precisely, of pre-Newtonian thinking.\nSuch beliefs are tested for by the Hestenes\u2013Halloun Force Concept Inventory (FCI) [3], which\ncontains 30 multiple-choice questions requiring no calculation but rather a solid understanding of\nNewtonian principles. For example, one question asks about a truck (lorry) colliding with a small\ncar: How does the force on the truck from the car compare with the force on the car from the\ntruck? The typical answer, which reveals that students do not understand the third law, is that\nthe truck exerts more force than the car exerts. Many American physics departments use the FCI\nbefore and after a semester of first-year mechanics (which is roughly at the level of British A-level\nphysics). Typical pre-instruction scores for American students range around 50% but that number\nvaries greatly among universities. Hestenes and Halloun state that scores of 60% indicate entry\ninto Newtonian thinking, and that scores above 85% indicate 'confirmed Newtonian think[ing]' [2].\nI gave the FCI to my ten students as their first assignment before lectures began. The lowest score\nwas 25/30 (83%) and the average was 27.5/30 (92%); one student had a perfect score of 30/30.\nThe students did extremely well on this measure.\n1.2 Beyond the Force Concept Inventory\nYet I doubted this conclusion for a number of reasons. First, on the difficult questions (such as\nthe truck question), students who answered it correctly often circled and then scribbled out one\nor two wrong answers before choosing the correct answer. Second, I realized how late in my study\nof physics I had sorted out the difference between Newton's second and third laws: only when I\nhelped to teach first-year physics as a graduate student.\nThe FCI is too easy for Cambridge students; they study physics and mathematics for many\nyears in high-school, far more than American students: In high school the Cambridge students\ntake A-level Mathematics, Physics, and Further Mathematics (and often Chemistry). Each A-level\ncourse, which takes up one-third or one-fourth of a student's time for the last two years of high\nschool, is equivalent to perhaps 1.5 Advanced Placement exams.\nSo, as part of the weekly tutorial work, I assigned free-response problems that required Newtonian thinking. Problem 15, for example, asks about skiing downhill holding a pendulum (the\nproblems are collected in the Appendix). A few students correctly guessed that, without friction,\nthe bob in case 1 points perpendicular to the hill. I say 'guessed', because none produced a freebody diagram or other convincing argument. All except one student said that the pendulum points\ndirectly downwards in case 3, when the skier is motionless at the top of her path. One student\nrealized that in each case the pendulum points perpendicular to the hill; he was the only student\nto realize that velocity was independent of acceleration. He also had the only perfect score on the\nFCI.\nProblem 12, about a bouncing steel ball, brought out the same difficulty. The freebody diagrams were correct for cases 1 and 2, but were wildly incorrect for case 3 (when the ball is motionless\nas it rebounds). A typical diagram had a downwards gravitational force of mg balanced by an upwards 'reaction' force of R = mg. The most common justification for R = mg was that the velocity\nis zero, so the body must be in equilibrium; another justification was that most reaction forces\nmet in A-level problems were equal to mg (see Section 3). This 'zero velocity implies zero force'\nreasoning illustrates the pre-Newtonian belief F \u221d v, rather than the Newtonian law F = ma.\n2\n\n\fOne student realized that the upwards force had to be larger than mg, otherwise the ball would\nnever leave the ground, but even he said that R was only 2mg. In the tutorial we estimated the\nupwards force by modelling the steel ball as a springy cube; all the students were surprised to find\nthat R \u223c 10000mg. To get a feel for these magnitudes, students could study such systems in their\nlaboratory courses.\n1.3 Newton's second and third laws\nStudents also have difficulty distinguishing Newton's second from Newton's third law. Most of\nthe difficulty results because students do not understand the third law. Problem 4 asks students\nto prove that a composite object has weight equal to the sum of the individual objects' weights\n(for a two-object system). None of the students provided a proof, and their explanations confused\nthe second and third laws. I therefore assigned the problem again, giving more instructions, as\nProblem 8. (The difficulty with proof is a mathematical trouble, and the topic of Section 2.1.)\nStudents stated that the force of their hand on the book equals the weight of the book, 'because\nof action\u2013reaction'. They did not realize that they had implicitly invoked equilibrium and must\ntherefore use Newton's second law to conclude that the two forces on the same object are equal\nand opposite. Students were surprised to find that the gravitational force of the book on the earth\nis the third-law counterpart to the weight of the book. They do not understand the third law as a\nstatement about interactions, so they see any pair of equal and opposite forces as a third-law pair.\nI often asked students to discuss a law for a candidate force:\ns1 s3\nF = k 42 ,\nr\nwhere s1 and s2 are charges, analogous to mass or electric charge, and k is the constant that makes\nthe dimensions correct. Could such a force exist? Students are pleasantly surprised that the third\nlaw forbids such forces because its force pairs are not equal and opposite.\n1.4 Heavier objects fall faster\nThe classic Aristotelian belief is that heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects. Surely three\nhundred years after Galileo showed otherwise, students no longer share this belief? Unfortunately,\nmany do, but the belief shows up only in novel situations. Students know that if a stone and a\ncannonball fall, they should say that both objects hit the ground 'at the same time'; if they have\nbeen carefully taught, they might even say 'roughly at the same time'. They also know what to\nsay about two objects sliding down an incline, that mass is irrelevant. However, when the problem\nincludes the novel effect of rolling (yet more trouble with circular motion!), many students have no\npracticed Newtonian answer to quote, and reveal their gut-level Aristotelian belief. For example,\nin Problem 23, about objects rolling down a plane, some students reasoned that an object with a\nlarge moment of inertia, such as a disc, rolls faster than an object with a small moment of inertia,\nsuch as a solid sphere. Two students argued that 'moment of inertia is analogous to mass, and\nheavier objects fall faster than lighter objects' ! I could not agree with the analogy, but I admired\nits boldness.\nThe way that rehearsal hides this misconception reminds me of the theory of the English\naccent: that if you step on an Englishman's toes in the middle of the night, he'll shout at you in\nan American accent. On this view, the one true accent is American. An English accent is just an\nact, a mask dropped upon surprise. Similarly, the students' response that 'all objects fall at the\nsame speed' is carefully rehearsed. It falls away when we step on their toes by asking about it in a\nnovel context, whereupon they reveal their true belief, that heavier objects fall faster.\n3\n\n\f1.5 Centrifugal force\nStudents think that circular motion implies a centrifugal force. I asked students to draw a freebody\ndiagram for an amusement park ride. In this ride, you stand against the edge of a cylindrical cage\nthat spins rapidly; eventually the floor drops away. But, voil\u00e0, you remain against the wall. This\nride is the subject of a typical high-school physics problem: Find the angular velocity such that\na person does not slide down the wall. Students solve it correctly, because they need only know\nthat some radial force is F = mv 2 /r (never mind in what direction it points) and that the friction\nforce is \u03bcF . However, when they draw a freebody diagram, their confusion is evident. A typical\ndiagram is Figure 1. Students insert the centrifugal force, because some force is 'throwing the\nperson outwards (which is why you feel pressed against the wall).'\nrotation\naxis\nfriction\nFcentrifugal\n\nFreaction\nmg\n\nFigure 1. Freebody diagram for amusement park ride.\n\n1.6 Freebody diagrams\nThe trouble with acceleration and confusion about third-law pairs means that students cannot\nmake freebody diagrams. In answers to Problem 4 (standing on a scale with a book in hand), most\nstudents drew book, person, and scale with no separations, and drew ambiguous contact forces\non the border between objects. These difficulties are typical when students first learn freebody\ndiagrams [1]. I had to explain that freebody diagrams are diagrams of one object (or of one\ncomposite object) \u2013 the free body \u2013 with other objects replaced by a force on the free body.\nIf students understood this replacement principle \u2013 and the idea of system \u2013 they would not\ndouble count by inserting centrifugal forces. Only when I asked them what object causes the\ncentrifugal force did they realize that this force merely labels an actual force and has no separate\nexistence. Unlike experienced physicists, students do not naturally make freebody diagrams to\nanalyze confusing situations. None of the students made a freebody diagram for Problem 15 (skier\nholding a pendulum), even the students who drew the correct pendulum positions. In university\nphysics we need to teach this valuable skill, which is not part of most British school physics curricula\n(although it is in most American physics textbooks).\n2 Mathematical troubles\nStudents have many mathematical difficulties. They have not been taught how to construct proofs\nor how to make educated guesses. They cannot make numerical estimates or reason using graphs.\n\n4\n\n\f2.1 Proof and guessing\nIn Section 1.3, I alluded to students' difficulty with proof (Problems 4 and 8 on weighing a composite\nobject). The solutions had numerous holes, besides the errors in using Newton's laws. When\nconfusion between Newton's second and third laws barred legitimate progress, students assumed the\nconclusion. Perhaps school mathematics should reintroduce Euclidean geometry, not to indoctrinate\nstudents with 10,000 theorems about triangles, circles, and diagonals of rhombuses, but to teach\nproof. We want students to learn how to distinguish sound from unsound arguments, whether or\nnot they become mathematicians.\nA complementary difficulty is fear of guessing. Students have not been taught techniques\nfor making educated guesses [7]; they are therefore reluctant to guess a solution before solving a\nproblem exactly. Having have no feel for how a result should turn out, they instead push symbols\naround until a reasonable formula appears and declare it to be the answer.\n2.2 Heuristic arguments\nStudents do not know how to tell whether an answer is reasonable. For example, they do not\nnaturally use heuristics such as checking limiting cases, or use more rigorous methods such as\ndimensional analysis. This difficulty is related to their reluctance to guess: If students had a clear\nidea of what answers might be reasonable, they would find it easier to guess an answer.\nAs practice with heuristic methods, I assigned Problem 2, analyzing the formula for the projectile range. A few students realized that, for example, v 2 results from one v in the flight time and\none v in the horizontal speed. Many, however, refused to make a heuristic analysis, and instead\nderived the range formula in the standard way.\nAlmost everyone is reluctant to make guesses, especially in a supposedly exact subject such\nas physics. To overcome this natural reluctance, we must teach students heuristic methods; with\npractice, students will develop the courage to use them.\nWhen I explicitly forbade messy calculations and forced students to use intuitive arguments,\nmany were stumped. Problem 14 asked them to determine, without evaluating any integrals,\nwhether a spherical shell or a flat disc (same radius and mass) has the larger moment of inertia.\nOnly one student found a correct argument: squashing the sphere perpendicular to the axis of\nrotation, and comparing the squashed mass distribution to the mass distribution of the flat disc.\nSome\nin spite of the instructions. But many evaluated the wrong integral,\nR 2 evaluated the integrals,\nR\n2\n\u03c1r dV , rather than \u03c1(x + y 2 ) dV (for rotation about the z-axis). More practice with heuristic\narguments, leading to conceptual understanding, would help them set up the correct integral.\n2.3 Graphical reasoning\nStudents cannot reason using graphs. The troubles are mathematical and physical. A mathematical\ntrouble is shown in the answers to Problem 27a (deriving Stirling's formula). Students correctly\ndrew a diagram like Figure 2. They then had to decide, 'Does the integral over- or underestimate\nthe sum?' Even with the clear graph that they had drawn, they did not see that the area under the\nsmooth curve is less than the area under the total rectangles. Instead, this realization came only\nby using a calculator to evaluate\n7\nX\nln k = 8.52 . . .\n1\n\n5\n\n\fand finding it larger than\nZ\n\n1\n\n7\n\nln k dk = 7 \u00d7 (ln 7 \u2212 1) + 1 = 7.62 . . .\n\nI cannot quarrel with the answer but the method reveals serious difficulty reasoning with graphs.\nIn a famous example, Wertheimer [9] would ask school students questions like\n273 + 273 + 273 + 273 + 273\n=?\n5\nSome students got the joke and laughed. Some protested that the calculations were too hard. Most\nworryingly, some added the 273's and then used long division to find. . . 273. With the answer one\nhas no quarrel, but like with the logarithm graph, the method reveals a fundamental difficulty.\n2\n\nln k\n\n1\n0\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nk\nFigure 2. Deriving Stirling's formula.\n\nStudents also do not realize the physical implications of a graph. For example, in Problem 26\n\u2013 about a snooker ball slipping and rolling \u2013 they realized that the ball slips for a while, then\neventually rolls, although not all correctly solved for the time t0 until pure rolling. However, their\ngraphs of center-of-mass velocity v and of scaled angular velocity r\u03c9 looked like Figure 3. Students\ndid not realize that the rolling condition, v = r\u03c9, requires that the two curves coincide after t0 .\nThis difficulty is also related to confusion about rolling motion. Students have memorized v = r\u03c9,\nbut are not sure of its character. They wonder if it is the definition of \u03c9. It took much discussion\nto convince them that v = r\u03c9 follows from the definition of rolling: Motion where the point of\ncontact is motionless. This difficulty with the character of v = r\u03c9 is related to the difficulties with\nproof. Students rarely know what assumptions a formula requires, or what consequences follow\nfrom a formula.\nv0\nv\nr\u03c9\n0\n0\n\nt0\nTime\n\nFigure 3. Snooker ball rolling and sliding.\n\n6\n\n\f2.4 Number sense and approximations\nPerhaps the most serious mathematical difficulty is an atrophied\nnumber sense and an inability\n\u221a\n1.2, and most\nto approximate. For example, I asked students to estimate\n\u221a\n\u221a had no idea. After I\nprodded them to guess anyway, one said 1.05; one said 1. 2 meaning 1 + 2/10 (at least a creative\nanswer). Only one student said 1.1, and he was unsure of himself. All the students except the one\nwho answered correctly had been using calculators since age 11. This other student, who went to\nschool in Singapore, had not been permitted to use a calculator\nuntil the last two years of high\n\u221a\n\u221a\nschool. Ironically, some students who could not evaluate 1.2 could instantly tell me that 1 + x\nis roughly 1 + x/2 by the binomial theorem.\nI am not surprised by this lack of number sense. I co-taught a short, intensive physics course\nto twenty A-level students; the course is run by Villiers Park, a charity in Foxton. The students,\nfrom all over the United Kingdom, were in their final year of high school, taking A-levels in Physics,\nMathematics, and Further Mathematics. Each participating school nominated its best physics student, and these students were all talented and curious about physics. Over one-half had interviews\nat Cambridge for admission to the Natural Sciences degree (which includes the physics major), and\na\u221a significant fraction of them will attend Cambridge to study physics. Yet none could estimate\n1.2; one student had trouble working out 120/10.\nFollowing up on approximations, I asked my Cambridge students to estimate ln 1.25. Some said\nthat there was a series for ln, which they could not remember. Some remembered that ln(1+x) \u2248 x,\nbut could not say why the approximation was plausible. A graphical approximation using the\ndefinition\nZ 1+x\ndx\nln(1 + x) \u2261\n,\nx\n1\nwas a new and pleasant surprise for them.\n2.5 Mathematics obscuring physics\nMathematics in a derivation often prevents students from understanding physics in the derivation.\nFor example, in the kinetic-theory derivation of the diffusion coefficient, a series of flux integrals\nsimplify to\n1\nD = lc,\n3\nwhere l is the mean free path and c is the root-mean-square particle velocity. Students do not\nrealize that all the fiddling with integrals of sines and cosines gives only the factor of 1/3, and\nthat the factor of lc is independent of the angular integrals. Partly, they have not been taught\ndimensional analysis, which requires that\nD = (dimensionless constant) \u00d7 lc.\nPartly, they do not understand diffusion even in one dimension, where angular factors no longer\ntorment them. We should spend most of the time on the qualitative reasoning in one dimension,\nand assert the result for three dimensions by fiat, giving the derivation in Eric Rogers' classic text,\nPhysics for the Inquiring Mind (Princeton University Press, 1960). That derivation, also used in\nthe old Nuffield O-level physics course (for ages 11-15!), uses six swarms of molecules, each marching\nalong one coordinate direction.\n\n7\n\n\f3 Parrot learning\nOne theme has shown up in many of these examples: A-level learning is parrot learning. Students\nmemorize rules without understanding their origin or range of validity. As Mark Twain said, 'It's\nnot what I do not know that worries me, it's what I know that ain't so.' Here are a few 'not-so'\nstories, culled from what students believe:\nEvery normal or reaction force is mg (or, on an incline, mg cos \u03b8). This rule is often true,\nbut students do not know when, and invoke it as a law of physics. Problem 9 asks what\na scale reads when the scale\u2013person system accelerates down a plane. A few students\ncorrectly reasoned that it reads 3mg/4, but most concluded that the scale reads mg.\nIn circular motion, there is a centrifugal force mv 2 /r. Such a force exists in the reference\nframe of the moving object, but students use it even in the laboratory frame, and do not\nrealize that its validity depends on the frame.\nTension is a force. This rule is always wrong; students induce it after seeing many freebody\ndiagrams in which arrows representing forces are labelled T. I once believed the rule for\nthe same reason. Now I always label forces produced by tension as FT . The rule causes\ntrouble when, for example, students analyze a tug-of-war. Two people hold one end each of\na rope and pull with force 100 N; what is the tension in the rope? Some students say zero:\nThey add the two end forces (to get an alleged force, the tension). Some say 200 N: They\nadd the force vectors as if they were unsigned scalars. A few say 100 N, without conviction.\nWe need not explain tension in its full glory as a component of the stress tensor, but we\nneed to eradicate this rule.\nIn oscillating motion, acceleration = 0 at the equilibrium position. This rule is correct for\nsimple harmonic motion, but students apply it too widely. For example, in Problem 5,\nasking about pendulum motion, most students stated that the bob was not accelerating\nat point C, probably because they had memorized pendulum motion as an example of\nsimple harmonic motion, and did not pause long enough to think that the bob must have\nan inwards acceleration to move in a circle. This difficulty is not confined to first-year\nphysics students. At the University of Washington, 0 out of 120 first-year physics students\nanswered it correctly, a result that no longer surprises me; however, only 15% of students\ntaking their PhD qualifying exams answered it correctly [8]!\n\nH2 O\n\nHg\n\nFigure 4. Perpetual motion.\n\nBuoyancy can be replaced by an upthrust, a vertical force with magnitude equal to the\nweight of fluid displaced. This rule is often true, but not in this perpetual-motion machine\nof Figure 4. The figure shows a cross-section of the machine: The circle is a long cylinder,\nand the dot at its center is a spindle that allows it only to rotate, not translate. The thick\nvertical line is a barrier that prevents the mercury and water from mixing. I explain to\nthe students why the fluid exerts a torque: The upthrust from the mercury side (longer\n8\n\n\farrow) is 13 times larger than the upthrust from the water side (shorter arrow), because\nmercury is 13 times denser than water. So the spindle rotates: perpetual motion! None of\nthe students exorcised the perpetual-motion demon without extensive help, because they\ndo not understand how upthrust or buoyancy is a consequence of pressure forces (which\nin this case all act through the spindle and hence provide no torque); instead, upthrust or\nbuoyancy is a memorized word.\nEven when the upthrust rule is true, students do not realize its origin. For example,\nin Problem 31, analyzing the isothermal atmosphere, students counted the buoyant force\ntwice in their freebody diagram for a slab of air (Figure 5). In the figure, A is the bottom\nor top surface area of the slab, and P1 A and P2 A are the pressure forces. Students realized\nthat P1 > P2 , and solved correctly for the pressure versus height, but did not realize that\nthe pressure forces already included the upthrust.\nP2 A\nupthrust\n\nmg\n\nP1 A\nFigure 5. Incorrect freebody diagram for a slab of air. The upthrust\nduplicates the result of the two pressure forces.\nMany school physics courses do not include Archimedes' principle; those that do often\nsimplify the treatment to 'upthrust', with no discussion of its origin in pressure forces. The\npreceding examples show the danger of such a simplification, which provides little scope\nfor thoughtful physical reasoning.\nParrot learning makes physics into a memory game, and students see physics the way many see\nhistory: as a collection of facts to memorize. Professional historians are repelled by this view of\nhistory, as we are by the same view of physics. Doing and enjoying physics requires understanding\nfundamental principles and seeing how they connect with one another.\n4 Suggestions\nAfter years of school physics, students should not have the mathematical and physical misconceptions that I have discussed. When they come to university, we should be able to discuss problems\nand ideas with them as budding physicists, even if they later specialize in other subjects. We\nobviously do not live in such a world; high-school physics does not give students a high level of\nmathematical and physical understanding.\nWe cannot expect any improvement soon. On the contrary, most changes in the school curriculum increase students' reliance on calculators and reduce the physics and mathematics that they\nmust know. Furthermore, many teachers, products of the school and university physics-teaching\nsystem (we share a lot of responsibility for the problem), have some of the above misconceptions;\n9\n\n\fevery time I teach, I find misconceptions in my own thinking. How can students learn what their\nteachers do not understand and what their textbooks do not mention?\nInstead of compounding the misconceptions, as we traditionally do in university physics teaching, we could remedy the defects. One solution is to teach qualitative physics. By qualitative I\ndo not mean physics for poets [4]; it is an excellent idea for a course, but it might poorly serve\nfuture scientists. Rather, I mean that we teach dimensional analysis, heuristic methods, graphical\nreasoning, and the arts of approximation and guessing: We should teach students how physicists\nthink.\nWe can illustrate these methods with applications to everyday physics; for example, to stirring\ntea (Problem 36). Students are fascinated by such problems. When I assigned the tea problem, they\ngathered in each others' rooms and spent hours stirring tea and timing the spindown. Such problems\ngive students a graspable example of a physical concept (in this case, diffusion of momentum).\nUsing everyday examples, students get feedback from the world on the correctness of their physical\npicture. When students study waves and oscillations, they can apply their knowledge to the physics\nof music, a subject that interests most physics students. Such an approach will inspire students\nand encourage them to think like physicists.\nI present here a few methods to teach qualitative physics, in order of increasing headache to\nimplement. A few methods apply more to the British university system, but I have tried to make\nmost methods of wide applicability.\n4.1 Peer instruction\nEric Mazur at Harvard developed a simple method for getting students to think qualitatively:\npeer instruction [5, 6]. After explaining a concept, such as buoyancy, he stops and puts on the\noverhead projector a multiple-choice question \u2013 called a Concept Question \u2013 for students to answer\nindividually. The question is easy for the student who understands the principle; otherwise it takes\na while, longer than Mazur gives them. One buoyancy question is:\nTwo cups are filled to the same level with water. One of the two cups has ice cubes floating\nin it. Which cup weighs more?\n1. The cup without ice cubes.\n2. The cup with ice cubes.\n3. The two weigh the same.\nTo allow no time for useless calculation, Mazur gives students only two minutes. Then he asks\nstudents which choice they picked. After this public commitment, each student spends one or\ntwo minutes convincing her neighbor of her answer \u2013 the key to Mazur's method. In explaining\ntheir choice, students realize what concepts confuse them and begin to sort out their confusions.\nAnd they get interested in the material as they defend their views. The discussion improves their\nattention and their intuition.\nMazur breaks lecture into 15-minute blocks; each block has a short explanation and then\ntime for a Concept Question. But even one question per one-hour lecture (the format used in\nCaltech first-year physics course) improves students' attention and understanding. Peer instruction\nhas several merits. First, it requires no fancy hardware in the lecture theatre (although Mazur's\nclassroom has networked palmtop computers for the students to enter answers); I get students to\nclose their eyes (to prevent the herd effect) and vote by raising hands. Second, anyone can try it,\nusing either their own questions or the database of ConcepTests in Mazur's book.\n10\n\n\f4.2 Two-week intensive preparation in the summer\nAnother possibility is to offer a two-week intensive 'order-of-magnitude physics' course for students\nbefore they start their year of physics. Two weeks of intensive teaching is enough time to teach\nthe main ideas, especially if the rest of the year occasionally uses the ideas taught in the intensive\ncourse. At Villiers Park, I taught qualitative physics for half a week to students in their last year\nof high school. The students enjoyed it, and by the end of the session, after they had seen the\nprinciples illustrated with many examples, they grasped the main ideas.\n4.3 Vacation study\nOr, the regular teaching could remain mostly as it is and instead students could learn qualitative\nphysics during the breaks between terms. This approach applies especially to British universities\nwith their short terms and long breaks (especially to Oxford and Cambridge, where terms are\nonly eight weeks!). With this approach, the examination at the end of the first year should contain\nquestions that require such reasoning, otherwise students might spend the entire vacation recovering\nfrom sleep deprivation rather than also learning physics. Students would need to written material\nto learn from, ideally a textbook on approximation and based on the first-year physics topics. The\nvacation-study approach has pros and cons. On the bad side, it reduces their sleep. Perhaps more\nfair is to winnow the standard topics, and use the time saved to teach approximation during the\nyear. On the good side, it encourages students to learn from textbooks, a skill valuable especially\nafter they finish their degree.\n4.4 Alter tutorials\nIn the Oxford and Cambridge system, with tutorial as well as lecture teaching, the lectures could\nremain traditional while tutors could teach qualitative physics. In the American system, the sections\ncould teach qualitative physics, leaving lectures alone. As with the vacation-study approach, the\nexam would need to be changed to emphasize the value of qualitative reasoning. Many graduate\nstudents, who are a large fraction of the tutors or section leaders, do not feel confident teaching\nmaterial that they did not learn at university. They would need training.\nWith proper training, this approach can work well, even if it is used only for one term. I used\nit with my students, assigning them the problems in the Appendix and using tutorials to discuss\nthe difficulties. The students and I enjoyed these problems. They prepare students to think like\nphysicists, although alone they do not prepare students for the first-year exam. So I asked students\nto use the Christmas vacation to practice old exam problems on the first term's material. The\nstudents were sufficiently happy with the method to do as I asked, but it requires extra time from\nthem and their tutors.\n4.5 Modify lectures and tutorials\nThe first term, or the first year, could teach qualitative physics \u2013 in lectures and tutorials. On the\ndown side, this approach combines the problems of the alter-tutorials approach (training tutors)\nwith the pain of redoing the lectures. A specially written textbook would be useful here. This\napproach, although painful, has the best chance of teaching the physics and mathematics that we\nwant students to know.\nEven with a radical approach of devoting the entire first year to qualitative physics, students\nwould not be harmed by the deemphasis on exact calculations. Those continuing as physics majors\nwill practice exact analyses in their second and third years; by then their mathematical maturity\n11\n\n\fwill be greater and the analyses will not hinder their understanding of physics (what it does in\nthe first year). Students majoring in chemistry, geology, or material science, who will study only\nthe qualitative physics, will also benefit. A geologist, for example, needs to estimate the relative\ncontributions of convection and conduction in transporting heat in the mantle more than she needs\nto solve exactly a model that includes only conduction. In general, non-majors need intuitive\nunderstanding of physics more than they need exact calculations.\nThe difficulties that students have with physics and mathematics are soluble. Using the methods\nabove, I hope that we can introduce students to many years of understanding and enjoying physics.\n\nReferences\n[1] Arnold B. Arons. Teaching Introductory Physics.

Estimate the annual\nbudget of the Royal Mail; check your estimate by looking up a recent Royal Mail budget.\n2 Interpreting equations\nHere you will study the well-known formula for the horizontal range of a rock. You throw a rock\nwith velocity v at an angle \u03b8 with respect to the ground. Its range is\nR=\n\n2v 2\nsin \u03b8 cos \u03b8.\ng\n\n(1)\n\nYou can increase your confidence in this result in a number of ways (parts a\u2013e). (It may help for\nmany of the parts to draw a diagram.)\na) Dimensional analysis: Check whether the dimensions are correct.\nb) Consider limiting cases (for example, \u03b8 = 0). Does the range formula work in these cases?\nc) Give a physical argument for why the range contains a factor of v 2 (instead of, say, simply v or\n1/v or no v at all). (Dimensional analysis, which you did in part a, is a mathematical argument;\nin this part, you are asked to reinforce the mathematics with a physical argument.)\nd) Give a physical argument for the factor of 2.\ne) Give a physical argument for the 1/g factor.\nf) To derive (1), you have to neglect many effects (for example air resistance). List as many of\nthese effects as you can. Let your imagination run; no effect is too small to mention here.\n3 Number sense\nWithout a calculator, estimate\n\u221a\na) 1.3\n\u221a\nb) 3 1.6\nc) sin 7\nd) 1.01100 (Hint: What is ln 1.01?)\n4 Scales\nYou stand on a scale holding a book. You then place the book next to you on the scale. The two\nscale readings are of course identical. Of course!? Prove it by using Newton's laws and drawing\nfree-body diagrams. Clearly label the third-law pairs (pairs that must be equal and opposite as a\nconsequence of Newton's third law),1 and describe each force in words.\n1\n\nI avoid using the perhaps more familiar term 'action\u2013reaction pairs' because it needlessly\nconfuses; it implies, wrongly, that one force causes the other.\n\n13\n\n\f5 Pendulum\nThe figure shows a pendulum at five points in its swing; positions A and E are the extremes of the\nmotion. On each bob, draw (approximately) the acceleration vector at that point in the swing. If\nthe acceleration is zero (in which case there is no arrow to draw), simply circle the bob.\n\nA\n\nE\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\n6 Tetrahedron\nIn methane, the four hydrogen atoms lie at the corners of a regular tetrahedron, and the carbon\natoms lies at the centre. Where is the centre of a tetrahedron with unit edge length? What is the\nbond angle (the angle between two C\u2013H bonds)? (Hint: Make an analogy.)\n7 Estimation\na) Estimate how thick a layer of rubber is deposited on the road by a car tyre. Comment on your\nresult.\nb) Estimate the world-record speed for cycling and for swimming. (Hint: First estimate how much\nmechanical power an athlete can put out.)\n8 Scales (again)\nYou stand on a scale holding a book (for simplicity of diagramming, you balance it on your head).\nYou then place the book next to you on the scale. The two scale readings are of course identical. Of\ncourse!? Prove the equality by using Newton's laws and drawing free-body diagrams. The givens\nhere are your weight and the book's weight. You are in effect asked to prove that the weight of the\ncombined you\u2013book object is the sum of the individual weights.\nDraw well-separated free-body diagrams. Clearly label the third-law pairs (pairs that must be\nequal and opposite as a consequence of Newton's third law); carefully distinguish uses of Newton's\nsecond law from Newton's third law; and describe each force in words. Ensure that your argument\nconvinces a skeptical reader (perhaps try it on your supervision partner), one who says at every\nopportunity 'Why are those forces equal in magnitude?', 'Are you sure it isn't Newton's third law\nthat justifies this step?', 'Or maybe it should be Newton's second law here?', and so on.\n\n14\n\n\f9 Skiing\nYou (tall rectangle, with mass m) stand on a wedge sliding down a frictionless plane, as shown in\nthe figure. What weight does the scale (shaded rectangle) read? Use clearly labeled, well-separated\nfree-body diagrams.\n\nm\n\n30\u25e6\n10 Analogy\nInto how many regions can n planes divide space? Find the maximum number (what conditions\non the planes ensure that the number is a maximum?). For example, one plane divides space into\ntwo regions; two planes divide space into at most four regions (but only three if you are unlucky,\nand only two if you are really unlucky). Hint: Play with the one- and two-dimensional versions of\nthis problem, and then try to generalize the patterns that you find.\n11 Virtual work\nThe mass m1 slides down the plane with constant velocity, and m2 rises with constant velocity (see\nthe figure). Use the principle of virtual work to find the mass ratio m1 /m2 . We live as usual in\nthe make-believe world of physics: The plane is frictionless, the string is massless, and the pulley\nis massless and frictionless.\n\nm\n\n1\n\nm2\n\u03b8\n\n12 Bouncing ball\nYou drop a steel ball from a height of one or two metres. It lands on a scale and bounces up to\nnearly the original height. (Neglect air resistance.) Draw free-body diagrams for the ball at four\ntimes: (1) whilst you are holding it, (2) whilst it is falling, (3) when it is motionless on the scale\n(namely, just as it starts its upwards journey), and (4) whilst it is rising. Indicate qualitatively\nthe relative magnitudes of the forces. Sketch qualitatively the scale reading as a function of time,\nwhilst the ball is on the scale.\n15\n\n\f13 Improved petrol\nDrivers want a petrol that yields more joules per kilogram than current petrol does. Discuss the\nfollowing proposal.\nWhen you accelerate your car from 0 to, say, 15 m s\u22121 , the increased kinetic energy, \u2206E1 , is\nsupplied by burning a quantity of petrol. Jack is driving in the opposite direction, at 5 m s\u22121 . From\nhis point of view, your car was going 5 m s\u22121 and, after accelerating, is going 20 m s\u22121 . He measures\na change in kinetic energy, \u2206E2 ; and \u2206E2 > \u2206E1 (check this assertion). The mass of petrol burned\nis the same in every reference frame, so Jack measures your petrol to have more energy per unit\nmass than you measure it to have. So, the proposal is: To increase the energy content of petrol,\nuse a moving reference frame.\n14 Moments of inertia\nWithout evaluating any integrals, rank the following objects in order of decreasing moment of\ninertia: (1) a solid sphere, (2) a thin ring, (3) a spherical shell, and (4) a thin disc. All objects have\nthe same mass and radius and are uniform. For each object, the axis of rotation passes through\nthe centre of mass. For the disc and the ring, the axis is perpendicular to the plane that contains\nthe disc or ring. Explain your rankings.\n15 More skiing\nYou ski down hill A and up hill B, then ski backwards down hill B and backwards up hill A (see\nfigure). There is no friction or air resistance, so the cycle repeats forever and ever. Being a skilled\nskier, you don't need to clutter your hands with poles; instead, from your hand, you dangle a string\nwith a mass at its end. Draw the direction of the string: (1) as you ski down hill A (square with\n1 in it), (2) as you ski up hill B (square with 2 in it), (3) when you are momentarily stopped on\nhill B (square with 3 in it), and (4) as you ski backwards down hill B (square with 4 in it). There\nis plenty of friction in the oscillations. How does each string's direction change if there is slight\nfriction on the slopes?\n\nv=0\n3\n4\nhill B\n\n1\n2\n\nhill A\n\n16 Falling moon\nThe moon is a rock; perhaps large, but it is still a rock. Why doesn't it fall to the earth, as other\nrocks do? Explain quantitatively, perhaps with one or two diagrams.\n\n16\n\n\f17 Messy collision\ni) A ball comes in from the left and causes a series of collisions; the initial motion is\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\nThe number in the circle is the object's mass (in arbitrary units) and the arrow shows the object's\nvelocity (in arbitrary units). All motion is one dimensional, and all collisions are elastic.\nWhich choice describes the motion after the all the collisions?\na)\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n2\n\nb)\n\n1\n3\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n3\n\nc)\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n4\n\nd)\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n2\n\nii) By transforming to the zero-momentum frame, work out the result of this collision (also onedimensional and elastic):\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\nComment on similarities or differences with part i.\n18 Mathematical conservation\nYou write a 0 on each vertex of a cube, except for a 1 on one of the vertices. Now you play a game.\nAt each move, you may add 1 to each of two adjacent numbers (adjacent means connected by an\nedge). Your goal is, using a suitable series of moves, to make all vertex labels be multiples of 3. Is\nthis goal possible? If it is, give the sequence of moves. If it is not, prove the impossibility.\n19 Pendulum\nAs a pendulum slowly loses energy, the amplitude of its swing decreases. How does the period\nchange as the amplitude decreases? Is it constant, decreasing, or increasing? Justify your answer.\n20 Centre of mass\nA uniform sphere, of radius r, has a sphere of radius r/2 cut out of it. The figure shows a cross\nsection through the sphere. Where is its centre of mass?\n\nr\n\n17\n\n\f21 Estimation: Oblateness of the earth\nCompared to a sphere, the earth is squashed.\na) Why? Should the polar radius or the equatorial radius be the larger?\nb) Which physical quantities determine d, the difference in radii? How can you combine these\nquantities into a length (in other words, into an estimate for d)?\nc) Use your formula to make a rough numerical estimate of d, and compare it with actual data.\n22 Moments of inertia\na) What are the dimensions of moment of inertia?\nb) An object has mass M and characteristic length l. The characteristic length is a typical length\nin the object, such as a radius or diamater. What is its moment of inertia, up to a dimensionless constant? Consider a geometrically similar object that is twice as big as this object, in all\nits dimensions, and made out of the same material. What is the ratio of moments of inertia:\nIbigger /Ismaller ?\nc) The moment of inertia of a uniform thin disc is MR2 /2, about an axis perpendicular to the plane\nof the disc and through its centre. Perhaps using your results from last week, guess a moment\nof inertia for a uniform spherical shell with mass M and radius R (axis of rotation through the\ncentre). Now calculate it and compare with your guess.\n23 Rolling\nFour objects, made of identical steel, roll down an inclined plane. The objects are (1) a large\nspherical shell, (2) a large disc, (3) a small solid sphere, and (4) a small ring. The large objects\nhave triple the radius of the small objects. Rank the objects in order of decreasing acceleration\ndown the plane.\n24 Buoyancy\nA solid iron sphere is floating in a bath of mercury. You pour water over the sphere and cover it\nwith water. Does the sphere rise, sink, or stay at the same height?\n25 Quadratics by approximation\na) Use the quadratic formula and your calculator to find the solutions of 1 + 200000x + x2 = 0.\nWhat goes wrong? Why?\nb) Instead, let's approximate. If x is near zero, which term can you neglect? Solve the simplified\nequation to get a first approximation to the smaller root. Call this first approximation x1 .\nc) How can you improve your approximation?\nd) If you know one root, how can you easily find the other root?\n26 Slipping and sliding\nYou give a snooker ball (mass m and radius r) a horizontal impulse through its centre of mass and\nit starts to move with velocity v0 . Let \u03bc be the coefficient of sliding friction.\na) At first, the ball skids; eventually, at some time t0 , it starts to roll. Why? On the same graph,\nsketch qualitatively the centre-of-mass velocity v(t) and the scaled angular velocity r\u03c9(t) (rather\nthan \u03c9, because \u03c9 and v do not have the same dimensions), label any interesting features, and\nexplain your reasoning. Be sure to specify your sign convention for \u03c9.\nb) Qualitatively, how does t0 depend on m, r, \u03bc, v0 , and g? How should the mass distribution\nwithin the ball affect t0 ? (For example, how should t0 for a spherical-shell ball compare with t0 for\n18\n\n\fa solid-sphere ball?) Based on your qualitative reasoning, guess an expression for t0 . Make sure\nthat your guess has dimensions of time!\nc) Now analyse the motion quantitatively. Solve for v(t) and r\u03c9(t), and sketch them on the same\ngraph. What is t0 ? Compare with your guess in part b, and discuss any differences.\nd) What is the final velocity of the ball, v(t0 )? What is the ball's kinetic energy? What fraction of\nits initial kinetic energy has it lost?\ne) How much work is done by the force of sliding friction? Is your result consistent with the energy\nloss from part d?\nf) Try it out: Strike a snooker ball as described, and collect whatever data you need to make a\nrough estimate of \u03bc.\n27 Stirling's formula\nStirling's formula says that, for large n,\nn! \u2248\n\n\u221a\n\n2\u03c0n\n\n\u0010 n \u0011n\ne\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nHere are two ways to derive a rough version of this formula.\nPn\na) The first version derives an expression for log n!, which is also k=1 log k. Sketch a graph of\nP\nlog k and mark the area represented by the sum nk=1 log k. As an approximation, replace the sum\nby an integral of log k and evaluate it to get an approximation to log n!. Does the integral over- or\nunderestimate the sum?\nb) i) For the\nsecond method, begin with a useful trick: differentiating under the integral sign. You\nR\u221e\nknow that 0 e\u2212t dt = 1 and, by changing variables, that\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ne\u2212at dt =\n0\n\n1\n.\na\n\nNow differentiate both sides of this expression n times with respect to a, and show that\nZ \u221e\ntn e\u2212t dt = n!.\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n0\n\nii) By approximating the integral (4), you can approximate n!. The integrand is also ef (t)\nwhere f (t) = n log t \u2212 t. Sketch f (t) as a function of t. Where is its maximum (call it t0 )? For large\nn, the exponential of f (t) is even more sharply peaked than f (t) itself; most of the contribution to\nthe integral comes from around t0 . Therefore, n! \u223c ef (t0 ) . What is the resulting approximation?\nHow does it compare with Stirling's formula (2)?\niii) This last approximation, n! \u223c ef (t0 ) , is dodgy: It neglects the width of the sharply peaked\nfunction ef (t) . A more accurate approximation is:\nn! \u223c ef (t0 ) \u00d7 width of peak.\nWhy? Draw a picture to explain the argument. Estimate the width (there are many reasonable\nways to make this estimate) and refine your estimate from ii. How does it compare with Stirling's\nformula?\nHow could you improve the approximation yet further? If you feel adventurous, derive\n\u221a\nthe 2\u03c0 factor.\n19\n\n\f28 Random walks\nA confusing feature of a random walk is the presence of square roots: Why in a random walk does\nit take on the order of N 2 steps to move a distance N ? Here is one way to understand this bizarre\nbehaviour. Imagine a particle making a one-dimensional random walk: with equal probabilities, it\nmoves one step either to the left or to the right. Let dn be its position after n steps, with d0 = 0.\nWe shall study hd2n i, the expected value of d2n .\n\na) After 0 steps, the distribution of possible d0 is simple: There is only one possibility, that the\nparticle is at the origin. So hd20 i = 0. After 1 step, the particle is at either \u22121 or +1, with equal\nprobabilities. So\n1\b\nhd21 i =\n(+1)2 + (\u22121)2 = 1.\n2\nWork out the probability distribution for the particle position after 2 steps, and from the distribution, work out hd22 i. Repeat for hd23 i and hd24 i. Generalise the pattern: After N steps, what is the\nexpected squared distance hd2N i? Harder: Prove your result.\np\nb) What is hd2N i? Therefore explain the behaviour mentioned in the introduction.\n\n29 Air molecules\n\na) Estimate the mean free path, l, of air molecules at room temperature. This length is the step\nsize in a random walk.\nb) Roughly how fast does an air molecule move? Call the speed c.\nc) What dimensions does a diffusion coefficient have? How can you combine c and l into a diffusion\ncoefficient? Estimate the diffusion coefficient, D, for air molecules in air (this coefficient is called\nthe self-diffusion coefficient of air). Estimate how long it would take an air molecule to diffuse\nacross a room.\nd) Fast pieces of fluid donate momentum to neighbouring slow pieces of fluid; so the fast pieces\nslow down, and the slow pieces speed up. The viscosity measures the ease with which the momentum diffuses. In air, momentum is diffused by particle motion directly: The particles carry their\nmomentum with them, so viscosity arises from the same physics as does molecular diffusion. The\nviscosity of air should therefore be related to the diffusion coefficient D, which you estimated in\npart c. What are the dimensions of viscosity? How can you turn D into a viscosity? Therefore\nestimate the viscosity of air, and compare with reality. Why can't you use the same method to\nestimate the viscosity of water?\n30 Atmosphere thickness\nHere is a crude method to estimate the height, H, of the earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere does\nnot end abruptly at H; rather, the density falls gradually to zero. You can think of H as the height\nat which the density has fallen by a significant fraction. To determine H, mentally launch an air\nmolecule vertically upwards; how high does it reach (if there is no atmosphere in its way)? The\nheight of course depends on the launch velocity. How can you choose a reasonable launch velocity?\nGet a numerical estimate for the height.\n\n20\n\n\f31 Atmosphere, take 2\nYou can also use a more honest method to work out the density versus height in the atmosphere.\nAssume that the atmosphere has a uniform temperature. Now work out how the density varies\nwith height. (Hint: Consider also how the pressure must vary, and use the ideal gas law to\nrelate pressure and density.) Your density should have the form of the Boltzmann distribution.\nCoincidence? Discuss.\n32 Return probability in random walks\nFrom last week: In a one-dimensional random walk, the particle's rms distance from the origin after\n\u221a\nn steps is n. You can use this result to determine the probability that the particle returns to the\norigin (the other possibility is that the particle escapes to infinity and never returns). The particle's\nposition is distributed with approximately a Gaussian distribution; the standard deviation is the\n\u221a\nrms distance n.\n\u221a\nApproximate the distribution instead as a rectangle of width n. In other words, replace the\nGaussian distribution by a uniform distribution. So pn , the probability that the particle is at the\n\u221a\norigin after n steps, is 1/ n (give or take a constant). What is the expected number of visits to\nthe origin over all time? What therefore is the probability that the particle returns to the origin?\nExtend the argument to two- and three-dimensional random walks. What if anything changes\nas you go from one to two to three dimensions?\n33 Tricky die (from vac problems)\nYou roll a 1000-sided die once per second.\na) How long, on average, between rolls of a 1? Answer: 1000 s\nb) Your friend Jane walks up and sees you rolling the die. How long does she have to wait, on\naverage, before a 1 turns up? Answer: 1000 s (careful of the gambler's fallacy)\nc) How long, on average, between the time that she walked up to you and the time that you last\nrolled a 1? Answer: 1000 s\nCombining the answers to parts b and c, we conclude that a 1 turns up every 2000 s, in\ncontradiction to part a. How can you resolve the paradox?\nIn the kinetic theory, you find the same paradox. A molecule travels on average a distance\nl (the mean free path) before colliding with another molecule. Observe one of the molecules and\nbe puzzled. How far away, on average, is its next collision? Answer: l, because molecules have no\nmemory. How far away, on average, was its last collision? Answer: l, because molecules have no\nmemory. So the mean free path should be 2l.\n34 Singing logarithms\nRead p. 25 approximating logarithms, and use the method to compute 38 and log10 5. How accurate\nare the values? Make up four more computations in which logarithms would aid the computation;\nuse the method to do the computations.\n35 Adiabatic or isothermal sound waves?\np\nNewton was the first to work out the speed of sound. He found that cs = P/\u03c1. Today we\nwould deduce the speed by deriving and solving the wave equation, which is a partial differential\nequation for the pressure p(x, t). When Newton derived the speed, regular derivatives were barely\nunderstood and partial derivative were unimagined.\nNewton's formula implicitly assumes the compressions and rarefactions that constitute a sound\nwave are isothermal. (An adiabatic compression happens too quickly for heat to flow and thereby to\n21\n\n\fequalise the temperature with the neighbouring rarefaction.) Are the compressions or rarefactions\nisothermal or adiabatic?\na) To decide, consider a sound wave with angular frequency \u03c9, which is f /2\u03c0. (Angular frequency\nusually makes for more accurate estimates than regular frequency does.) Roughly how long does\na compression last? Call this time tc . The size of the compression region is roughly cs /\u03c9, which\nis usually called \u03bb\u0304. Roughly how long does it take the heat in this region to diffuse outside this\nregion? Call this time td . Hint: In a gas, the molecular-diffusion constant D is roughly equal to\nthe heat-diffusion constant \u03ba. Sketch tc and td as functions of \u03c9 (on the same graph). What is\nspecial about the intersection frequency (call it \u03c90 )? What is \u03c90 as a function of \u03ba and cs ?\nb) From Set 6, Question 4d, you know that \u03ba \u223c lcs , where l is the mean free path. Actually, you\nfound that D \u223c lc, where c is a typical molecular speed, but c \u223c cs , and D \u223c \u03ba. If \u03c4 is the mean\nfree time, then l \u223c cs \u03c4 . Use this relation to simplify your expression for \u03c90 .\n\nc) Is a sound wave of frequency f = 256 Hz adiabatic (this tone is roughly middle C)? Therefore\ndecide whether Newton's implicit assumption is correct.\nd) Now decide experimentally. Compute cs for air at sea level using Newton's formula. The\nadiabatic speed is given by\n\u221a\n= \u03b3 cisothermal\ncadiabatic\n,\ns\ns\nwhere \u03b3 is the ratio of specific heats cp /cv , which is roughly 1.4 for dry air. How closely do the two\nspeeds match the actual speed of sound?\n36 Teacup spindown\nYou stir your afternoon tea to mix the milk (and sugar if you have a sweet tooth). Once you remove\nthe stirring spoon, the rotation starts to slow. What is the spindown time \u03c4 ? In other words, how\nlong before the angular velocity of the tea has fallen by a significant fraction?\nTo estimate \u03c4 , consider a physicist's idea of a teacup: a cylinder with height L and diameter\nL, filled with liquid. Why does the rotation slow? Tea near the edge of the teacup \u2013 and near the\nbase, but for simplicity neglect the effect of the base \u2013 is slowed by the presence of the edge (the\nnoslip boundary condition); the edge produces a velocity gradient. Because of the tea's viscosity,\nthe velocity gradient produces a force on any piece of the edge; this force tries to spin the piece in\nthe direction of the tea's motion. The piece exerts a force on the tea, which is equal in magnitude\nand opposite in sense: The edge slows the rotation.\na) In terms of the total viscous force F and of the initial angular velocity \u03c9, estimate the spindown\ntime. Hint: Consider torque and angular momentum. (Feel free to drop any constants, such as \u03c0\nand 2, by invoking the Estimation Theorem: 1 = 2.)\nb) You can estimate F with the idea that\nviscous force \u223c \u03c1\u03bd \u00d7 velocity gradient \u00d7 surface area.\n\n(5)\n\nHere \u03c1\u03bd is \u03b7. The more familiar viscosity is \u03b7, known as the dynamic viscosity. The more convenient\nviscosity is \u03bd, the kinematic viscosity. (To see why \u03bd might be more convenient than \u03b7, work out\nthe dimensions of \u03bd.) The velocity gradient is determined by the size of the region in which the\nthe edge has a significant effect on the flow; this region is called the boundary layer. Let \u03b4 be its\nthickness. Estimate the velocity gradient near the edge, and use (5) to estimate F .\n\n22\n\n\fc) Put your expression for F into your earlier estimate for \u03c4 , which should now contain only one\nquantity that you have not yet estimated (the boundary-layer thickness).\nd) You can estimate \u03b4 using your knowledge of random walks. The boundary layer is a result of\nmomentum diffusion; just as D is the molecular-diffusion coefficient, \u03bd is the momentum-diffusion\ncoefficient. In a time t, how far can momentum diffuse? This distance is \u03b4. What is a natural\nestimate for t? (Hint: After rotating 1 radian, the fluid is moving in a significantly different\ndirection than before, so the momentum fluxes no longer add.) Therefore estimate \u03b4.\ne) Now put it all together: What is \u03c4 ?\nf) Stir some tea and estimate \u03c4exp . Compare this value with the value predicted by your theory.\nIn water (and tea is roughly water), \u03bd \u223c 10\u22126 m2 sec\u22121 .\n37 Stokes' law\nYou can use ideas from the previous problem to derive Stokes' formula for drag at low speeds (more\nprecisely, at low Reynolds' number). Many weeks ago, we derived the result from dimensional\nanalysis; here you will find a physical argument.\nConsider a sphere of radius R moving with velocity v. Equivalently, in the reference frame of\nthe sphere, the sphere is fixed and the fluid moves past it with velocity v. Next to the sphere, the\nfluid is stationary. Over a region of thickness \u03b4 (the boundary layer), the fluid velocity rises from\nzero to the full flow speed v. Assume that \u03b4 \u223c R (the most natural assumption) and estimate the\nviscous drag force. Compare the force with Stokes' formula (remember that \u03c1\u03bd = \u03b7).\n\n23\n\n\fApproximate Logarithms Using Half-Decibels\u2217\nSemitones\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n17.4\n19\n24\n28\n31\n34\n36\n38\n40\n\nInterval\nM2\nm3\nM3\nP4\nd5\nP5\nm6 = P8 \u2212 M3\nM6 = P8 \u2212 m3\nP5 + m3\n2 * P4\nP8\nP8 + P5\n2 * P8\n2 * P8 + M3\n2 * P8 + P5\n3 * P8 \u2212 M2\n3 * P8\n2 * (P8 + P5)\n3 * P8 + M3\n\nRatio\n9/8\n6/5\n5/4\n4/3\n\u221a\n2\n3/2\n8/5\n5/3\n9/5\n16/9\n17/9\n2\ne\n3\n4\n5\n6\n64\n\u2248\n7\n9\n8\n9\n10.\n\nExact Value\n1.122\n1.1885\n1.259\n1.3335\n1.4125\n1.496\n1.585\n1.679\n1.7783\n1.7783\n1.8836\n1.9953\n2.718\n2.9854\n3.981\n5.012\n5.9566\n7.080\n7.943\n8.913\n10.\n\nSymbol\nM2\nm3\nM3\nP4\nd5\nP5\nm6\nM6\nP8\n\nKEY\nInterval\nMajor 2nd\nMinor 3rd\nMajor 3rd\nPerfect 4th\nDiminished 5th\nPerfect 5th\nMinor 6th\nMajor 6th\nOctave\n\nNotes\nC\u2013D\nC\u2013E\u266d\nC\u2013E\nC\u2013F\nC\u2013G\u266d\nC\u2013G\nC\u2013A\u266d\nC\u2013A\nC\u2013C\n\nThe starting point is 210 \u2248 103 , or 21/12 \u2248 101/40 . By chance 21/12 is the semitone frequency ratio on the\nequal-tempered scale. Since we know what Pythagorean ratios the equal-tempered intervals are supposed\nto approximate, we can approximate logarithms to the base 21/12 , and thereby approximate logarithms to\nthe base 101/40 . The ratio column indicates the ratios for perfect Pythagorean intervals, and the exact\nvalue column shows 10semitones/40 , to show the accuracy of the method. Note that 10 semitones has two\npossible breakdowns into intervals, as P5 + m3 or 2 * P4. The second is much more accurate, because in\nthe equal-tempered scale, the perfect intervals come out almost exactly right, at the cost of some error in\nthe major and minor intervals.\nTo use the table to compute log10 x, find x as a product of ratios, add the number of semitones for\nthe ratios, and divide by 40 (divide by 2 to get dB). To calculate 10x , multiply x by 40, find that value\nin the semitones column, and read off the corresponding ratio. From a few basic Pythagorean ratios and\nnumber of semitones, most of the table is easy to figure out. The most important to remember one is the\nfifth: 7 semitones corresponds to 3/2. For example, from the fifth we can compute the frequency ratio for\na fourth (5 semitones). The two intervals together make an octave, so the product of their frequency ratios\nis 2. This means 5 semitones corresponds to 4/3. Many other entries can be worked out similarly.\nSome examples (arrows point from the real to the log world):\n\n\u0010 \u001110\n4\n3\n\n2 \u2192 1 octave = 12 semitones = 6 dB = 0.3 decades.\n\u2192 10 * P4 = 50 semitones = 40 + 2 * P4 \u2190 10 *\n\n5=\n\u2217\n\n16\n= 17.78 (exact 17.76).\n9\n\n5\n28\n* 2 * 2 \u2192 M3 + 2 * P8 = 28 semitones =\nor 0.7 decades (14 dB).\n4\n40\n\nMethod due to the statistician I.
