[1, 2] in 1959 for pp\u0304 annihilations. Bose-Einstein correlations originate from the symmetrization of the two-particle wave function of identical\nbosons and lead to an enhancement of boson pairs emitted with small relative momenta.\nThe effect is sensitive to the size of the emitting source. The studies of BEC for pairs\nof identical particles have been carried out in a large variety of particle interactions. In\nparticular, H1 and ZEUS have reported results on inclusive charged particle pairs in e\u00b1 p\ncollisions at HERA [3, 4]. Recent reviews [5\u20139] summarise the underlying theoretical concepts and experimental results. The measurements of the radius of the emission source\nhave been mostly performed for neutral and charged pions. For other bosons, e.g. kaons,\nthe information is scanty.\nThis paper reports first results on BEC for pairs of charged (K \u00b1 K \u00b1 ) and neutral (KS0 KS0 )\nkaons in deep inelastic scattering (DIS) at HERA. The measurements are compared with\nresults from e+ e\u2212 interactions whose fragmentation properties are expected to be similar\nto the current region of DIS [10]. However, proton fragmentation may lead to a significant\ndifference in the properties of the hadronic final state.\nThe correlation function for two identical kaons is defined as\n\nR(Q12 ) =\n\nP (Q12 )\n,\nP0 (Q12 )\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Q12 is the four-momenta difference of the kaons with four momenta p1 and p2 given\nas\nQ12 =\n\nq\np\n2\n\u2212(p1 \u2212 p2 )2 = MKK\n\u2212 4m2K ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere MKK is the invariant mass of the pair of kaons and mK is the kaon rest mass. The\nfunction P (Q12 ) in Eq. (1) is the two-particle density: P (Q12 ) = (1/N)(dnKK /dQ12 ),\nwhere nKK is the number of kaon pairs and N is the number of events. The denominator\nof Eq. (1), P0 (Q12 ), is the two-particle density in the absence of BEC.\nFor a static source with a Gaussian density distribution, the correlation function can be\nparametrised as follows [2]:\nR(Q12 ) = 1 + \u03bb exp(\u2212r 2 Q212 ).\n1\n\n(3)\n\n\fThe \u03bb parameter gives information about the strength of the BEC. For a completely\ncoherent source, \u03bb is zero, while for a completely incoherent source, \u03bb is one [11]. Contributions from decays of short-lived resonances can further modify this parameter. The\nparameter r is related to the size of the source and is called the radius in the following\nsections.\n\n2\n\nExperimental set-up\n\nThe analysis was performed with data taken by the ZEUS detector between 1996 and 2000\nat HERA. The data from e\u00b1 p collisions collected in this period with electron1 energy Ee =\n27.5 GeV and proton energy Ep = 820 GeV (1996 \u2212 1997) or Ep = 920 GeV (1998 \u2212 2000)\ncorrespond to an integrated luminosity of 121 pb\u22121 .\nA detailed description of the ZEUS detector can be found elsewhere [12]. A brief outline\nof the components that are most relevant for this analysis is given below.\nCharged particles are tracked in the central tracking detector (CTD) [13], which operates\nin a magnetic field of 1.43 T provided by a thin superconducting coil. The CTD consists of 72 cylindrical drift chamber layers, organized in 9 superlayers covering the polarangle2 region 15\u25e6 < \u03b8 < 164\u25e6 . The transverse-momentum resolution for full-length tracks\nis \u03c3(pT )/pT = 0.0058pT \u2295 0.0065 \u2295 0.0014/pT , with pT in GeV. To estimate the energy\nloss, dE/dx, of tracks, the truncated mean of the sense-wire pulse-heights was recorded\nfor each track, discarding the 10% lowest and up to the 30% highest pulses [14\u201316]. The\nmeasured dE/dx values were normalised to the dE/dx peak position for tracks with momenta 0.3 < p < 0.4 GeV, the region of minimum ionisation for pions. Henceforth,\ndE/dx is quoted in units of minimum ionising particles (mips). The resolution of the\ndE/dx measurement for full-length tracks is about 9%. The tracking system was used to\nestablish the primary and secondary vertices.\nThe high-resolution uranium\u2013scintillator calorimeter (CAL) [17] consists of three parts:\nthe forward, the barrel and the rear (RCAL) calorimeters. Each part is subdivided transversely into towers and longitudinally into one electromagnetic section and either one or\ntwo hadronic sections. The smallest subdivision of the calorimeter is called a cell. The\n\u221a\nCAL energy resolutions, as measured under test-beam conditions, are \u03c3(E)/E = 0.18/ E\n\u221a\nfor electrons and \u03c3(E)/E = 0.35/ E for hadrons, with E in GeV.\n1\n2\n\nHere and in the following, the term ,,electron\" denotes generically both the electron and the positron.\nThe ZEUS coordinate system is a right-handed Cartesian system, with the Z axis pointing in the\nproton beam direction, referred to as the \"forward direction\", and the X axis pointing left towards\nthe center of HERA. The coordinate origin is at the nominal interaction point.\n\n2\n\n\fThe energy of the scattered electron was corrected for energy loss in the material between\nthe interaction point and the calorimeter using the small-angle rear tracking detector\n[18, 19] and the presampler [18, 20].\n\n3\n\nEvent and track selection\n\nThe inclusive neutral current DIS process e(k) + p(P ) \u2192 e(k \u2032 ) + X can be described in\nterms of the following kinematic variables: Q2 , the virtuality of the exchanged photon,\nx, the Bjorken scaling variable and y, the fraction of the lepton energy transferred to the\nproton in the proton rest frame. They are defined as follows: Q2 = \u2212q 2 = \u2212(k \u2212 k \u2032 )2 ;\nx = Q2 /(2P * q); y = (q * P )/(k * P ), where k, k \u2032 and P are the four-momenta of initial\nand final scattered electrons and incoming proton, respectively. These variables were\nreconstructed using the electron method (denoted by the subscript e), which requires\nmeasurements of the energy and angle of the scattered electron.\nA three-level trigger system [12] was used to select events online. At the third level,\nelectrons with energy greater than 4 GeV and position outside a rectangle defined by\n|X| < 12 cm, |Y| < 6 cm on the face of the RCAL were accepted. Data below Q2 \u223c\n20 GeV2 were prescaled to reduce the trigger rate.\nThe offline selection of DIS events was based on the following requirements:\n\u2022 |Zvtx | < 50 cm, where Zvtx is the Z component of the primary-vertex position determined from the tracks. This cut reduces the background from non-ep interactions;\n\u2022 an identified scattered electron in the CAL with energy Ee \u2265 8.5 GeV;\n\u2022 2 \u2264 Q2e \u2264 15000 GeV2 ;\nP\n\u2022 35 < \u03b4 < 60 GeV, where \u03b4 =\nEi (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8i ), Ei is the energy of the ith calorimeter\ncell and \u03b8i is its polar angle as viewed from the primary vertex. The sum runs over all\nCAL cells. This cut reduces the background from photoproduction and events with\nlarge initial-state radiation;\n\u2022 ye \u2264 0.95, to remove events with misidentified scattered electrons;\n\u2022 yJB \u2265 0.04, to remove events with low hadronic activity, where yJB is the value of y\nreconstructed using the Jacquet-Blondel method [21].\nGood quality tracks measured in the CTD with high acceptance and resolution were\nselected using the following requirements: transverse momentum pT > 0.15 GeV and\npseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 1.75. In addition, the tracks were required to pass through more\nthan three CTD superlayers.\n\n3\n\n\fAfter the above cuts, the data sample contained 25 million events with at least two good\ntracks and the average Q2 of the sample was hQ2 i = 35 GeV2 .\n\n3.1\n\nSelection of charged kaons\n\nCharged kaons were selected using the energy-loss measurement, dE/dx. The analysis\nused all tracks fitted to the primary vertex with the exception of the scattered-electron\ntrack. Tracks were selected as described above. The dE/dx as a function of momentum\nfor positively charged tracks is shown in Fig. 1a. The curves indicate the region used for\nidentification of positively charged kaons. Kaons were selected by requiring f < dE/dx <\nF , where f and F are functions of the track momentum, p, motivated by the Bethe-Bloch\nequation. For positive kaons f = 0.08/p2 + 1.0, F = 0.17/p2 + 1.03 mips and for negative\nkaons f = 0.08/p2 + 1.0 and F = 0.18/p2 + 1.03 mips (with p in GeV). The slight\ndifference arises from the different response of the CTD to positive and negative tracks.\nThe kaons were identified for p < 0.9 GeV and dE/dx > 1.25 mips.\nThe kaon identification efficiency for pt > 0.15 GeV, |\u03b7| < 1.5 and p < 0.9 GeV was 61%,\nwith a purity of 90%. The resulting data sample contained 55522 K + K + or K \u2212 K \u2212 pairs.\n\n3.2\n\nNeutral kaon selection\n\nThe KS0 mesons were identified using the charged-decay channel KS0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 with a\nsimilar selection as in a previous publication [22]. The pion tracks were required to\noriginate from secondary vertices. Assigning the pion mass to both tracks, the invariant\nmass M(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) was calculated and the candidate was accepted if the mass was within\n\u00b1 20 MeV of the nominal PDG [23] KS0 mass. To eliminate tracks from photon conversions\nand \u039b/\u039b\u0304 contamination, the electron, pion and proton masses were assigned to tracks and\nthe following cuts were used: M(e+ e\u2212 ) > 80 MeV and M(\u03c0p) > 1121 MeV.\nThe following additional requirements were applied to the selected KS0 candidates:\n\u2022 2 < Ld < 30 cm, where Ld is the decay length of the KS0 candidate;\n\n\u2022 \u2206Z < 0.8 cm, where \u2206Z is the projection on the Z axis of the vector defined by the\nprimary interaction point and the point of closest approach of the KS0 candidate;\n\u2022 \u03b1XY < 8\u25e6 , where \u03b1XY is the (collinearity) angle between the candidate KS0 momentum\nvector and the vector defined by the interaction point and the KS0 decay vertex in the\nXY plane;\n\u2022 pPA\n> 0.11 GeV, where the Podolanski-Armenteros variable pPA\nis the projection of\nt\nt\nthe candidate pion momentum onto a plane perpendicular to the KS0 momentum direction [24].\n\n4\n\n\fThe total number of KS0 candidates was 725505. After all cuts, the selected data sample\ncontained 19494 KS0 KS0 pairs and 400 triples. Each combination of two particles was\nincluded in the analysis. Figure 1b shows the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass distribution after the\nKS0 -pair selection and a fit to the signal plus linear background, which resulted in an\nestimated background of 1.4%.\n\n4\n\nMonte Carlo simulation\n\nInclusive DIS events with Q2 > 2 GeV2 were generated without BEC using the Ariadne\n4.10 Monte Carlo (MC) model [25] interfaced with Heracles 4.6.1 [26] via the Djangoh\n1.1 program [27, 28] in order to incorporate first-order electroweak corrections. The Lund\nstring model [29] was used for the description of hadronisation, as implemented in the\nJetset 7.4 [30] program.\nThe generated events were passed through a full simulation of the detector using the\nGeant 3.13 program [31] and reconstructed and analyzed in the same way as the data.\nThe Ariadne MC sample corresponds to a similar integrated luminosity as that of the\ndata.\n\n5\n\nExtraction of BEC parameters\n\nThe main difficulty in measuring BEC is in the construction of a reference sample which\nshould be as close as possible to the analyzed data in all aspects but free from the BoseEinstein effect. The obvious reference sample provided by unlike-sign charged kaon pairs\ncannot be used due to the strong signal of the \u03c60 (1020) \u2192 K + K \u2212 decay at low values of\nQ12 .\nA reference sample can be derived from a Monte Carlo simulation without BEC. In this\nso-called single-ratio method, the correlation function R(Q12 ) is defined as: RS (Q12 ) =\nP (Q12 )data /P (Q12 )MC,noBEC , where P (Q12 )data is the normalized two-particle density distribution for the data and P (Q12 )MC,noBEC is the corresponding distribution obtained for\nMC without BEC. However, this approach requires a correct simulation of the physics\nprocesses in the absence of BEC, as well as a good description of the detector effects.\nIn another approach, a reference sample can be obtained using an event-mixing procedure\nwhere two kaons from different events are combined. This method, which is used in\nthis analysis, is less sensitive to imperfections in the MC simulation. To correct for\nother correlations lost in the event-mixing procedure, the two-particle correlation function\nR(Q12 ) was calculated using the double-ratio method:\n\n5\n\n\fP (Q12 )data\nR(Q12 ) =\nPmix(Q12 )data\n\n,\n\nP (Q12 )MC,noBEC\n,\nPmix(Q12 )MC,noBEC\n\n(4)\n\nwhere Pmix (Q12 )data is the two-particle density constructed from pairs of kaons coming\nfrom different events and Pmix (Q12 )MC,noBEC is obtained in a similar way for MC events.\nThe double-ratio method was used for the main analysis and the single-ratio method only\nto estimate systematic uncertainties.\nTo fit the correlation function R(Q12 ) defined by Eq. (4), the modified Goldhaber parametrisation (Eq. (3)) multiplied by an empirical term 1 + \u03b2Q12, which accounts for the presence\nof possible long-range two-particle correlations for high Q12 , is often used:\n2\n\n2\n\nR(Q12 ) = \u03b1(1 + \u03bbe\u2212Q12 r )(1 + \u03b2Q12 ).\n\n(5)\n\nSuch correlations are imposed for example by energy and charge conservation, phase-space\nconstraints or strangeness compensation. In this analysis, the \u03b2 parameter was found to\nbe zero within errors and its possible deviation from zero was included in the systematic\nuncertainties.\n\n6\n\nSystematic uncertainties\n\nSystematic uncertainties on the fitted \u03bb and r parameters arise from event and track\nselection, the modeling of dE/dx, the fitting procedure and the construction of the reference sample. They were calculated from the deviation of the fit parameters from their\nnominal values after changing the analysis cuts or procedures. For charged kaons, a bias\noriginating from the contamination of the experimental kaon sample by pion, proton and\nantiproton is expected. For neutral kaons, a bias can be introduced by the contamination\nof the sample by KS0 KS0 pairs from the decay of f0 (980) resonance. These effects are\ndiscussed in the next sections.\nThe following systematic studies were carried out for the charged kaon sample. The\nresulting changes for \u03bb and r are given in parentheses as [\u2206\u03bb, \u2206r]:\n\u2022 the correlation function was calculated using the single-ratio method [\u22120.01, \u22120.03];\n\u2022 the fit was repeated for different lower and upper limits of Q12 . In addition the binning\n+0.09\nin Q12 was modified [+0.04\n\u22120.04 ,\u22120.04 ];\n\u2022 the momentum range was reduced to p < 0.7 GeV for both the double [+0.06, +0.06]\nand single [+0.01, \u22120.01] ratio methods;\n6\n\n\f\u2022 the definition of the kaon band was varied for the double-ratio method [\u22120.02, +0.05]\nand the single-ratio method [\u22120.04, \u22120.02];\n\u2022 the track quality cuts were changed within their resolutions [\u22120.02, +0.04];\n\n+0.02\n\u2022 the DIS selection cuts on Ee , ye , yJB , \u03b4 were varied within the resolutions [+0.02\n\u22120.02 ,\u22120.02 ];\n\n\u2022 the influence of pion, proton and antiproton contamination was checked by tightening\nand relaxing the kaon selection criteria. The purity was raised to 99% [+0.05, +0.07]\nand was brought down to 80% [\u22120.04, \u22120.05].\nThe following systematic uncertainties for neutral kaons were considered:\n\u2022 the correlation function was calculated using the single-ratio method [+0.10, +0.02];\n\u2022 the fit was repeated for different lower and upper limits of Q12 . In addition, the binning\n+0.09\nin Q12 was modified [+0.04\n\u22120.04 ,\u22120.04 ];\n\u2022 the cuts on the KS0 momentum, \u03b1XY , \u2206Z, M(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) were varied [\u22120.08, \u22120.08];\n\u2022 the cut on pPA\nwas changed to 0.12 GeV [+0.04, +0.02];\nt\n\u2022 the full Eq. (5) was used to check the sensitivity of the fit to possible long-range\ncorrelations [+0.11, +0.03];\n\u2022 the track quality cuts were changed within the resolution [+0.15, +0.02];\n\u2022 the cut to remove the e+ e\u2212 background was changed to M(e+ e\u2212 ) > 50 MeV [+0.08, +0.03];\n+0.02\n\u2022 the DIS selection cuts on Ee , ye , yJB , \u03b4 were varied within resolutions [+0.02\n\u22120.02 ,\u22120.02 ].\n\nThe contributions from the different groups of systematic uncertainties in the parameters\n\u03bb and r were added in quadrature separately for positive and negative variations. The\noverall systematic uncertainties in \u03bb and r for K \u00b1 K \u00b1 and KS0 KS0 are presented in Table 1.\n\n7\n7.1\n\nResults\nCorrelations in K \u00b1K \u00b1 pairs\n\nFigure 2 shows the measured two-particle correlation function for K \u00b1 K \u00b1 pairs. The\nresults obtained by the fit function given by Eq. (5) with \u03b2 = 0 are r = 0.57 \u00b1 0.09\nfm and \u03bb = 0.31 \u00b1 0.06. The 90% purity of the kaon selection introduces in the kaon\npair sample an 18% admixture of unlike particles pairs which are not correlated. The\nmeasured \u03bb is therefore expected to be underestimated by 18%. The systematic checks\ninvolving purity confirm this expectation. After the correction for purity, the result is\n\u03bb = 0.37 \u00b1 0.07+0.09\n\u22120.08 . The value of the radius is not affected by this correction and\n7\n\n\fthe result is r = 0.57 \u00b1 0.09+0.15\n\u22120.08 fm. The corrected parameters of BEC correlations\n\u00b1 \u00b1\nfor K K pairs are presented in Table 1. The radius value is consistent with that for\n+0.022\ncharged particles: r = 0.54 \u00b1 0.03+0.03\n\u22120.02 fm for H1 [3] and r = 0.666 \u00b1 0.009\u22120.036 fm\nfor ZEUS [4]. The obtained value of \u03bb for kaons is in agreement with the H1 result for\ncharged particles \u03bb = 0.32 \u00b10.02 \u00b10.06, although somewhat smaller than the ZEUS result\n\u03bb = 0.475 \u00b1 0.007+0.011\n\u22120.003 .\n\n7.2\n\nCorrelations in KS0 KS0 pairs\n\nThe KS0 KS0 pairs may originate not only from K 0 K 0 , K\u0304 0 K\u0304 0 (strangeness S = \u00b12) states\nbut also from the K 0 K\u0304 0 (strangeness S = 0) system, which may come from the decay\nof resonances. It has been shown [32, 33] that a Bose-Einstein-like enhancement is nevertheless expected in the Q12 distribution of the KS0 KS0 pairs, even when their origin is\nfrom the K 0 K\u0304 0 system. According to the MC simulation of DIS events, about 75% of\nlow-Q12 KS0 KS0 pairs come from K 0 K\u0304 0 . Similar to the case of charged kaons, Eq. (5) with\n\u03b2 = 0 was used to fit the correlation function calculated for KS0 KS0 pairs. The so-called\n+0.07\nraw results are \u03bb = 1.16 \u00b1 0.29+0.28\n\u22120.08 and r = 0.61 \u00b1 0.08\u22120.08 fm. The results are presented\nin Table 1 and Fig. 3. The measured radii for K \u00b1 K \u00b1 and KS0 KS0 are close to each other.\nFor KS0 KS0 the fit does not take into account a possible contamination from the scalar\nf0 (980) resonance decaying below the K K\u0304 threshold. The decay channel f0 (980) \u2192 K 0 K\u0304 0\nis not included in the standard MC, therefore the f0 (980) contribution may distort the\nstrength of the Bose-Einstein effect. In order to investivate this, a MC sample with BEC\nat maximum strength was generated. A comparison of this MC with the data showed an\nexcess for Q12 < 0.6 GeV, which may indicate a possible f0 contribution. The same excess\nis also visible in the MKK distribution, as illustrated in Fig. 4a.\nThe expected contribution from f0 can be approximated by a modified Breit-Wigner\nfunction as proposed by Flatt\u00e9 [34\u201336]:\nd\u03c3\nm20 * \u0393KK\n= NF *\n,\n2\ndMKK\n(m20 \u2212 MKK\n)2 + (m0 * (\u0393\u03c0\u03c0 + \u0393KK ))2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere m0 = 0.954 GeV is the mass of f0 (980) and the widths \u0393\u03c0\u03c0 and \u0393KK are related\np\n2\nMKK\n/4 \u2212 m2\u03c0 and\nto the coupling\nconstants\ng\n\u03c0 = 0.11 and gK = 0.423 by \u0393\u03c0\u03c0 = g\u03c0\np\n2\n\u0393KK = gK MKK\n/4 \u2212 m2K . The normalization factor, NF , was adjusted to give the total\nnumber of f0 (980) \u2192 KS0 KS0 decays for MKK < 1.8 GeV. Fig. 4a shows the distribution\nof d\u03c3/dMKK according to Eq. (6). Figure 4b shows the MKK distribution in the data\nafter subtraction of the standard MC without BEC together with different contributions\nof the f0 resonance. An f0 contribution of about 7% is sufficient to account for the data,\n\n8\n\n\ftherefore, the present analysis cannot distinguish the Bose-Einstein effect from the effect\nof an f0 contribution. Assuming that both BEC and f0 are present, the amount of f0 was\nestimated from the shape of the R(Q12 ) distribution (Eq. (4)). For this purpose, fits of\nthe correlation function were carried out with different percentages, cf0 , of f0 subtracted\nfrom the data. A shallow minimum of the \u03c72 (cf0 ) value for cf0 = 4% was found, with\none-sigma limits of cf0 = 1% and cf0 = 7%. The values of \u03bb and r at cf0 = 4% were taken\nas the most probable result and their uncertainties were calculated from the one sigma\nlimits of cf0 .\nThe results corrected for the f0 contamination are included in Table 1. After adding\nthe uncertainties coming from the f0 subtraction to systematics, the corrected results\n+0.11\nare \u03bb = 0.70 \u00b1 0.19+0.47\n\u22120.53 and r = 0.63 \u00b1 0.09\u22120.08 fm. The uncertainty on a possible f0\nadmixture leads to a large systematic uncertainty on \u03bb. The radius r is less sensitive to\nthe f0 admixture. The radii for KS0 KS0 and K \u00b1 K \u00b1 are very similar.\n\n7.3\n\nComparison with e+ e\u2212 interactions\n\nFigure 5 shows the comparison for r between DIS and e+ e\u2212 annihilation results at\nLEP [36\u201339] for both charged and neutral kaons. The radius value obtained in DIS agrees\nwith the measurements from LEP. The same figure also presents DIS results for unidentified charged particles. The kaon results agree with those for charged particles within\nsystematic uncertainties. The \u03bb value for charged kaons in DIS is somewhat smaller than\nthat in e+ e\u2212 collisions, which may be related to the fact that the DIS data mostly populate\nthe proton fragmentation region in the Breit frame.\n\n8\n\nConclusions\n\nBose-Einstein correlations have been measured for pairs of charged and neutral kaons in\ndeep inelastic scattering at HERA using the ZEUS detector. The values of the radius\nfor charged and neutral kaons agree within systematic uncertainties. They are also consistent with the measurements for charged particles in DIS and kaons in e+ e\u2212 collisions\nat LEP. The f0 (980) \u2192 KS0 KS0 decay can significantly affect the \u03bb parameter for KS0 KS0\ncorrelations.\n\n9\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe wish to thank the DESY Directorate for their strong support and encouragement.
