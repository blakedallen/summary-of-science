The \u03a9\u2212 baryon, consisting of three valence strange quarks is, significantly more stable than other members\nof the baryon decuplet, such as the \u2206, with a life-time of the order of 10\u221210 s. This fact makes the calculation\nof its electromagnetic form factors particularly interesting since they are accessible to experimental measurements\nwith smaller theoretical uncertainties. Its magnetic dipole moment is measured to very good accuracy, unlike those\nof the other decuplet baryons. A value of \u03bc\u03a9\u2212 = \u22122.02(5) is given in the PDG [1] in units of nuclear magnetons\n(\u03bcN ). Within lattice QCD one can directly compute hadron form factors starting from the fundamental theory of the\nstrong interactions. Furthermore, higher order multipole moments, not detectable by current experimental setups,\nare accessible to lattice methods and can reveal important information on the structure of the hadron. An example\nis the electric quadrupole moment, which detects deformation of a hadron state.\nIn this work we calculate, for the first time, the electromagnetic form factors of the \u03a9\u2212 baryon using dynamical\ndomain-wall fermion configurations. For the calculation we use the fixed-sink approach, which enables the calculation\nof the form factors for all values and directions of the momentum transfer ~q concurrently. The main advantage of this\napproach is that it allows an increased statistical precision, while at the same time it provides the full Q2 dependence,\nwhere Q2 = \u2212q 2 . In order to obtain accurate results on the form factors we construct optimized sources for the\nsequential inversion. This is particularly important for the subdominant electric quadrupole form factor, for which we\nconstruct an appropriate source that isolates it from the two dominant form factors [2]. This requires extra sequential\ninversions but it is essential in order to determine the electric quadrupole form factor to good accuracy.\nThe form factors are calculated using Nf = 2 + 1 dynamical domain-wall fermion configurations at the three\nlowest pion masses currently available, namely m\u03c0 = 350 MeV, m\u03c0 = 330 MeV and m\u03c0 = 297 MeV. The results\nare compared to those obtained with a hybrid action that uses domain wall valence quarks on staggered sea quarks\nsimulated by the MILC collaboration [3].\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Section II we provide the definitions of the corresponding multipole form\nfactors and describe the lattice setup to extract them. In Section III we discuss the results and in Section IV we give\nthe conclusions.\n\n\f2\nII.\nA.\n\nLATTICE TECHNIQUES\n\nElectromagnetic matrix element\n\nThe \u03a9\u2212 has spin and isospin 3/2 and therefore the decomposition of the electromagnetic matrix element is the\nsame as that of the \u2206. The on-shell \u03a9\u2212 matrix element of the electromagnetic current V \u03bc , is decomposed in terms\nof four independent Lorentz covariant vertex functions, a1 (q 2 ), a2 (q 2 ), c1 (q 2 ) and c2 (q 2 ), which depend only on the\nsquared momentum transfer q 2 = \u2212Q2 = (pi \u2212 pf )2 . The initial and final four-momentum are given by pi and pf ,\nrespectively. In Minkowski spacetime these covariant vertex functions are given by [4]\ns\nm2\u03a9\n\u016b\u03c3 (pf , sf )O\u03c3\u03bc\u03c4 u\u03c4 (pi , si ),\nh\u03a9(pf , sf )|V \u03bc |\u03a9(pi , si )i =\n(1)\nE\u03a9 (p~f )E\u03a9 (~\npi )\n\u0014\n\u0011\u0015 q \u03c3 q \u03c4 \u0014\n\u0011\u0015\na2 (q 2 ) \u0010 \u03bc\nc2 (q 2 ) \u0010 \u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03c3\u03bc\u03c4\n\u03c3\u03c4\n2 \u03bc\n2 \u03bc\n\u2212\n(2)\npf + pi\npf + pi .\nO\nc1 (q )\u03b3 +\n= \u2212g\na1 (q )\u03b3 +\n2m\u03a9\n4m2\u03a9\n2m\u03a9\nThe rest mass and the energy of the particle are denoted by m\u03a9 and E\u03a9 , respectively. The initial and final spinprojections are given by si and sf , respectively. Recall also that\u0001 every vector component of the spin- 32 RaritaSchwinger vector-spinor u\u03c3 satisfies the Dirac equation, p\u03bc \u03b3 \u03bc \u2212 m\u03a9 u\u03c3 (p, s) = 0, along with the auxiliary conditions:\n\u03b3\u03c3 u\u03c3 (p, s) = 0 and p\u03c3 u\u03c3 (p, s) = 0. Additionally, the covariant vertex functions are linearly related to the (dimensionless) electric GE0 (q 2 ), GE2 (q 2 ) and magnetic GM 1 (q 2 ), GM 3 (q 2 ) multipole form factors [2, 4]. Namely, the expressions\nrelating the multipole form factors and the covariant vertex functions are given in Ref. [4] and are quoted below for\nreference:\n1\n2\nGE0 = (1 + \u03c4 )[a1 + (1 + \u03c4 )a2 ] \u2212 \u03c4 (1 + \u03c4 )[c1 + (1 + \u03c4 )c2 ],\n3\n3\n1\nGE2 = a1 + (1 + \u03c4 )a2 \u2212 (1 + \u03c4 )[c1 + (1 + \u03c4 )c2 ],\n2\n4\n2\nGM 1 = (1 + \u03c4 )a1 \u2212 \u03c4 (1 + \u03c4 )c1 ,\n5\n5\n1\nGM 3 = a1 \u2212 (1 + \u03c4 )c1 ,\n2\n\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n\n2\n\nq\nwhere the positive quantity \u03c4 = \u2212 4m\n2 .\n\u03a9\n\nB.\n\nLattice setup\n\nWe use gauge configurations generated by the RBC-UKQCD collaborations using Nf = 2 + 1 domain-wall\nfermions [5] and the Iwasaki gauge-action. The simulations are carried out on two lattices of size 243 \u00d7 64 at a\npion mass of 330 MeV and 323 \u00d7 64 at pion masses of 355 MeV and 297 MeV, respectively. The latter has a smaller\nlattice spacing and therefore we will refer to it as the fine lattice. For the 243 \u00d7 64 lattice, or coarse lattice, the lattice\nspacing a, the light u- and d-quark mass as well as the strange quark mass were fixed by an iterative procedure using the\n\u03a9\u2212 , the pion and the kaon masses [5] as inputs. The value obtained for the lattice spacing is a\u22121 = 1.729(28) GeV [5].\nFor the fine lattice the scale was fixed from the ratio of the pion decay constant, f\u03c0 calculated on the fine lattice to the\none computed on the 243 \u00d7 64 at the same values of the ratio m\u03c0 /f\u03c0 . The value found is a\u22121 = 2.34(3) GeV [6]. In\naddition, to these two lattices, we perform the calculation using a mixed-action with domain-wall valence quarks and\nstaggered sea quarks. The gauge configurations were produced by the MILC collaboration [7, 8] using two degenerate\nflavors of light staggered sea quarks and a strange staggered sea quark fixed to its physical mass. The lattice size is\n283 \u00d7 64 and the mass of the light quarks corresponds to a pion mass of 353 MeV. The lattice spacing is 0.124 fm as\ndetermined from the \u03a50 \u2212 \u03a5 mass difference [7]. For the valence quarks we use domain wall fermions (DWF). The\nvalence strange-quark mass was set using the NF = 3 ensemble by requiring the valence pseudoscalar mass to be\nequal to the mass of the Goldstone boson constructed using staggered quarks [9]. Similarly the light quark valence\nmass is tuned by adjusting the DWF pion mass to the taste-5 staggered Golstone boson pion. The domain wall quark\nmasses take the values given in Table I. Technical details of this tuning procedure are given in Refs. [9\u201311].\nIn all cases we used N5 = 16, which is what was used in the simulation of the dynamical domain wall fermions. We\nnote that for the coarse lattice at the pion mass used here the residual mass is large compared to the bare quark mass\n\n\f3\nand chiral symmetry breaking is expected. The value of N5 = 16 is also used in the mixed action calculation where\nit was shown that the residual mass is 10% of the bare quark mass, ensuring small chiral symmetry breaking [10]. In\nTable I we provide details of the simulations, along with the value of the mass of the \u03a9\u2212 obtained in this work as well\nas the value computed by other groups when available.\nsubd.\ndom.\nL3s \u00d7 LT Nconfs\nNconfs\na\u22121 [GeV] mu,d /ms m\u03c0 [GeV] mN [GeV]\nm\u03a9 [GeV]\nNF = 2 + 1 domain wall fermions [5]\n243 \u00d7 64 200\n200 1.729(28) 0.005/0.04 0.329(1) 1.154(7) [12] 1.77(3) (1.758(9)) [5]\nNF = 2 + 1 domain wall fermions [6]\n323 \u00d7 64\n\u2013\n105\n2.34(3) 0.006/0.03 0.355(6)\n1.172(21)\n1.79(4)\n323 \u00d7 64 200\n120\n2.34(3) 0.004/0.03 0.297(5)\n1.109(21)\n1.76(2)\nMixed action [18]\nDWF valence: amu,d = 0.0138, ams = 0.081\n283 \u00d7 64 210\n120\n1.58(3) 0.01/0.05 0.353(2)\n1.191(19) 1.78(3) (1.775(5)) [9]\n\nsubd.\nTABLE I: Parameters used in the calculation of the form factors.

To ensure\nground state dominance at the shortest possible Euclidean time separation we perform a gauge invariant Gaussian\nsmearing on the strange quark fields that enter in the interpolating field, as described in Refs.

These values agree with the value found in Ref. [5]. The\nsame agreement is obtained in the case of the hybrid action. In Ref. [5] it was found that, at the chiral limit, the \u03a9\u2212\nmass decreases by about 2% its value at amu,d = 0.005. Compared to the experimental value of 1.672 GeV [1] the\nvalue obtained at the physical point is about 50 MeV higher indicating that the strange quark mass is a few percent\nlarger than the physical one in these simulations.\n\n\f4\n\u03bc=1, n=(0,1,0)\n-0.15\n-0.2\n\nm\u03c0 = 355 MeV\nm\u03c0 = 353 MeV\nDWF, m\u03c0 = 330 MeV\nDWF, m\u03c0 = 297 MeV\n\n1.6\n\nDWF,\n\nHYBRID,\n\n-0.25\n\n\u03bc=2, n=(1,0,0)\n\n0.25\n\n1.4\n\nR\n\n0.2\n1.2\n\n0.15\n\nam\u03a9\neff\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n\u03bc=3, n=(1,0,0)\n\n-0.15\n-0.2\n\n0.8\n\n-0.25\n-1\n\n0.6\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n20\n\nt/a\n\nFIG. 2: The ratio R \u2261 R\u03c3\u03c4 \u03bc (\u0393, q~, t) extracted for temporal source-sink separations tf /a = 8 and tf /a = 10,\nusing 50 gauge configurations.

(19). As expected, current conservation q\u03bc \u03a0\u03bc = 0 is manifest in\nthe right hand side of the equations. From these expressions all the multipole form factors can be extracted. For\ninstance Eq. (21) is proportional to GM 1 , while Eq. (23) isolates GE2 for \u03bc = 4. Furthermore, these combinations\nare optimal in the sense that all momentum directions, each of which is statistically different, contributes to a given\nQ2 -value. This symmetric construction yields a better estimator for the \u03a9\u2212 -matrix elements than methods where\nonly one momentum-vector is accessible.\nIn this paper, we consider only connected contributions to the three-point function. These are calculated by\nperforming sequential inversions through the sink, which necessitates fixing the quantum numbers of the initial and\nfinal states as well as the time separation between the source and the sink. The optimal combinations given in\nEq. (21) - Eq. (23), from which GE0 , GM 1 and GE2 are determined, can be implemented by an appropriate sink\nconstruction which requires only one sequential inversion for each of the three types of combinations. No optimal sink\nis considered for the octupole magnetic form factor in this work. Although it can and has been extracted, the results\nexhibit large errors and are consistent with zero. We therefore refrain from presenting this specific form factor. The\nmatrix element for all the different directions of ~q and for all four directions \u03bc of the current can then be computed\nyielding an over-constrained system of linear equations which can be solved for the form factors in the least squares\nsense. A singular value decomposition of the coefficient matrix is utilized to find the least squares solution. The\nstatistical errors are found by a jack-knife procedure, which takes care of any possible autocorrelations between gauge\nconfigurations.\nAs already mentioned, the three-point function of the connected part is calculated by performing sequential inversions through the sink. This requires fixing the temporal source-sink separation. In order, to determine the smallest\ntime separation that is still sufficiently large to damp excited state contributions, we perform the calculation at two\nvalues of the sink-source separation. We use tf /a = 8 and tf /a = 10 for the DWF configurations corresponding to the\ncoarse lattice spacing a = 0.114 fm. We compare in Fig. 2 the results for the plateaus \u03a0\u03c3\u03c4 \u03bc (\u0393, ~q), for a few selected\ndirections of the current and for low momentum ~q values for these two sink-source time separations. As can be seen,\nthe plateau values at tf /a = 10 are consistent with the smaller time separation the latter exhibiting about half the\nstatistical error. We therefore use tf /a = 8 or tf = 0.91 fm as source sink separation. For the fine DWF lattice the\ninversions were performed for tf /a = 12, which corresponds to about tf = 1.008 fm. Similarly for the hybrid scheme\nthe time separation was taken to be at tf /a = 8 or tf = 0.992 fm.\nIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nWe use the local electromagnetic current, V \u03bc = \u2212 31 s\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc s, which requires a renormalization factor ZV to be included.\nThe vector current renormalization constant is determined from the lattice calculation by the requirement that\nZV GE0 (0) = \u22121,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere -1 is the charge of \u03a9\u2212 . The values of ZV extracted using Eq. (24) are given in Table III, where the errors shown\nare statistical. For the coarse lattice with DWF, the value of ZV = 0.7161(1) is calculated [17] from the pion decay\nconstant. For the fine lattice ZV was fixed using the nucleon electric form factor [6] with values ZV = 0.7468(39) at\nm\u03c0 = 297 MeV and ZV = 0.7479(22) at m\u03c0 = 355 MeV. For the mixed-action [18] with m\u03c0 = 353 MeV the value\nof the current renormalization constant ZV = 1.1169 is obtained by dividing the unrenormalized isovector current\n\n\f7\nwith the forward matrix element. These values differ by about 1%-2% with the ones found using Eq. (24). This\ndiscrepancy indicates systematic errors on the 2% level.\nA.\n\nElectric charge form factor\n\nOur results for the electric charge form factor, GE0 (Q2 ), are depicted in Fig. 3 for the fine and coarse lattice\nusing DWF and for the mixed action. Results using the mixed action have consistently smaller values. This can be\nattributed either to cut-off effects or to a small dependence on the mass of the light sea quack mass. In order to check,\nwe perform a calculation using DWF at m\u03c0 = 355 MeV on the fine lattice for the magnetic dipole form factor. This\nwill be discussed in next section. In Fig. 3 we show fits to a dipole. As can be seen, the momentum dependence of\nthis form factor is adequately described in all cases by a one-parameter dipole form\nGE0 (Q2 ) = \u2212\n\n1\n1+\n\n\u0001 .\nQ2 2\n\u039b2E0\n\n(25)\n\nIn the non-relativistic limit the slope of the above dipole form evaluated at momentum transfer Q2 = 0, is related to\nthe electric charge mean square radius by\n2\nrE0\n=\u2212\n\n6\nd\nGE0 (Q2 )\nGE0 (0) dQ2\n\n.\n\n(26)\n\nQ2 =0\n\n0\n\n-0.2\n\nGE0\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.8\nHYBRID,\nDWF,\n\n-1\n\nDWF,\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nm\u03c0 = 353\nm\u03c0 = 330\nm\u03c0 = 297\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n1\nQ2 (GeV2)\n\nMeV\nMeV\nMeV\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\nFIG. 3: The electric charge form factor GE0 (Q2 ) computed at m\u03c0 = 330 MeV and at m\u03c0 = 297 MeV.

These values are\nslightly greater in magnitude than the one reported in Ref. [19], which was obtained in a quenched lattice QCD\ncalculation. The discrepancy may originate from unquenching effects or pronounced light quark mass dependence\n2\nsince the pion mass used in the quenched study of Ref. [19] is larger than what used here. The results for the rE0\nare given in Table III.\n\n1\n\nNote the different sign as compared to Ref. [19] since we here divide by GE (0) = \u22121.\n\n\f8\nB.\n\nMagnetic dipole form factor\n\nIn order to check for cut-off effects we perform a comparison between the hybrid results and results obtained at\nthe same pion mass using DWF on our fine lattice. This comparison is shown in Fig. 4, The results using a hybrid\naction show a small deviation having a smaller slope as compared to the DWF results. This is the same behavior as\nwas observed in the case of the electric form factor. Given the fact that the lattice spacing for the mixed action is the\nlargest this points to cut-off effects. In Fig. 5 we show results obtained using DWF on the coarse and fine lattices,\nwhich are in agreement.

In this work we extract\nfor the first time in unquenched QCD the subdominant GE2 form factor for the \u03a9\u2212 baryon, to sufficient accuracy to\nexclude zero values. This has been achieved by utilizing two different lattices: namely, the fine DWF lattice and the\nMILC lattice at lattice spacings of a = 0.084 fm and a = 0.124 fm respectively. We note that for the coarse DWF\nlattice the results for GE2 are too noisy to exclude a zero value and we therefore do not present them here.

For the evaluation of the densities we used the dipole\nparametrization of the form factors.\n\nWe note that for a spin- 23 particle without internal structure, for which GM 1 (0) = 3e\u03a9 and GE2 (0) = \u22123e\u03a9 [21, 22],\nthe quadrupole moment of the transverse charge densities vanishes. We calculate this quantity by using a fit to the\nelectric quadrupole to obtain the value at Q2 = 0. The results obtained are shown in Table III and plotted in Fig. 10\nfor the dipole fitting Ansatz. Both of the two values are negative and consistent within statistical errors. Therefore,\nthey suggest that the quark charge distribution in the \u03a9\u2212 must be deformed. In order to investigate the deformation\nin more detail we construct the transverse charge density in the infinite momentum frame, following Refs. [21, 22].\nConsidering the spin of the \u03a9 along the x-axis and states of transverse spin s\u22a5 = 3/2 and s\u22a5 = 1/2 we obtain the\n\u03a9\n~\n~\n~\ntransverse charge densities \u03c1\u03a9\nT 3/2 (b) and \u03c1T 1/2 (b) in term of the two-dimensional impact parameter b.

In Fig. 9\nwe show the individual multipole fields for the state with transverse spin s\u22a5 = 3/2.\nD.\n\nExtrapolation to the physical point\n\nIn this section we examine the sea quark dependence of the magnetic moment, radii and the quadrupole moment.\nThey are extracted by fitting the Q2 -dependence of the form factors to a dipole form. As can be seen from Fig. 10\nthe sea quark mass dependence is consistent with a constant for all quantities confirming that sea quark effects are\nsmall. In particular, the value of the magnetic form factor at Q2 = 0 is consistent with experiment. On the other\nhand extrapolating the magnetic moment we obtain the value given in Table III. This is 5% smaller than experiment\nwhich is to be expected given the larger value of the strange quark mass. The reason is that the mass of the \u03a9\u2212 is 5%\nlarger than experiment and this will affect the value of the magnetic moment when we convert to nuclear magnetons.\nIn the fits for the magnetic moment and radii we did not include the results obtained in the hybrid action because of\nthe small finite a effects observed. Given the large statistical errors on quadrupole moment such small finite-a effects\nare negligible and therefore, in this case, we include the result using the hybrid action to obtain the extract the value\nat the physical point. In Table III we give the values that we find at the physical point for the radii and the dipole\nand quadrupole moments of the transverse charge density obtained from Eq. (31).\n\n2\n2\nFIG. 10: From top to bottom we show GM 1 (0), the magnetic radius hrM\n1 i, the electric radius hrE0 i and the quadrupole\nmoment extracted from Eq. (31) as a function of m2\u03c0 extracted from dipole fits. The point shown by the filled square is the\nvalue extracted from the fit at the physical pion mass. In all cases except for the quadrupole moment the results using the\nhybrid action are excluded form the fit.\n\n\f13\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nBy utilizing properly constructed sequential sources the dominant \u03a9\u2212 electromagnetic form factors GE0 and GM 1\nare calculated with good accuracy using dynamical domain-wall fermion configurations as well as a hybrid action.\nIn addition, we extract the magnetic moment of the \u03a9\u2212 by fitting the magnetic dipole form factor GM 1 to a twoparameter dipole form. We find a value that is within errors to the experimentally measured value [1]. The electric\n2\n2\ncharge and magnetic radii (hrE0\ni and hrM\n1 i) are computed and like the magnetic dipole moment they do not show\nsea quark dependence in the range of masses studied in this work.\nFinally, the subdominant electric quadrupole form factor GE2 is computed for the first time in an unquenched lattice\ncalculation to sufficient accuracy to exclude a zero value. This has been accomplished by constructing an appropriate\nsink that isolates it from the two dominant form factors. We find consistent results with DWF and using a hybrid\naction. The positive non-zero values of GE2 at Q2 = 0 suggest that the structure of the \u03a9\u2212 baryon is non-spherical.\nIn the light-front frame we find that the quark charge density in a \u03a9\u2212 for a state of transverse spin projection +3/2\nis shows an elongation along the axis of the spin (prolate deformation). As compared to the \u2206+ in the same state\nthe amount of deformation seen in the \u03a9\u2212 is smaller.\nAcknowledgments\nThis research was partly supported by the Cyprus Research Promotion Foundation (R.P.F) under contracts\n\u03a0ENEK/ENI\u03a3X/0505-39 and EPYAN/0506/08 and by the U.S. Department of Energy under Grant DE-FG02-94ER40818.
