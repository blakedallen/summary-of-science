Observations have shown that the \"tilt\" of the FP involves more than a simple non-homology or stellar population\neffect: lower-mass ellipticals have a higher ratio of stellar to dark matter within their stellar effective radii.\nTheoretical models have attempted to explain this via dissipation: if ellipticals are formed in major mergers\nof disks, then mergers between disks having a larger gas content (typically observed to be lower-mass disks)\nwill yield remnants with a larger mass fraction formed in a central, compact starburst, giving a smaller stellar\nRe and lower Mtot /M\u2217 within that Re . Such starbursts leave a characteristic imprint in the surface brightness\nprofiles of ellipticals, in the form of a central excess above the outer profile established by the dissipationless,\nviolent relaxation of disk stars. In previous work, we implemented a purely empirical method to use such\nfeatures in the observed profiles of ellipticals to robustly estimate the amount of dissipation involved in the\noriginal spheroid-forming merger. Applying this to a large sample of ellipticals with detailed kinematic and\nphotometric observations, we demonstrate that the location of ellipticals on the FP and its tilt are in fact driven\nby dissipation. We show that at fixed mass, ellipticals formed in more dissipational events, as indicated by their\nobserved profiles, are smaller and have a lower ratio Mtot /M\u2217 . At the same (fixed) degree of dissipation, there\nis no tilt in the FP \u2013 i.e. ellipticals formed with a similar level of dissipation have the same ratio of enclosed\nstellar to total mass within Re .\nWe further demonstrate that observations and these models obey the \"homology assumption,\" i.e. that the\ntrue enclosed mass Mtrue (Re ) \u221d \u03c3 2 Re . Measured at the radii of disks of the same mass, we show that ellipticals\nhave the same total enclosed masses as those disks \u2013 i.e. that the FP tilt can be effectively removed. Therefore,\nthe fundamental plane tilt cannot primarily owe to non-homology or to changes in the dark matter distribution:\nit must arise as a result of a contraction of the baryonic component relative to the dark matter in the process that\ntransforms disks to ellipticals, as predicted by dissipational mergers. If we allow for the observed cosmological\ndependence of disk gas fraction on mass, the observed FP, size-mass, and velocity dispersion-mass correlations\nare reproduced by our models, as are the observed homology constraints and profile shapes. Dissipation is both\nnecessary and sufficient to explain the observed FP correlations of ellipticals. These observations all favor\ntheories in which ellipticals are formed in major mergers of disks with gas fractions, sizes, and dark matter\ncontent similar to that observed as a function of mass in low-redshift disks: unusually compact disks are not\nrequired to make \u223c 0.01 \u2212 10 L\u2217 ellipticals. We present a number of associated predictions that can be used to\nfurther test these assertions.\nSubject headings: galaxies: elliptical and lenticular, cD - galaxies: evolution - galaxies: formation -\ngalaxies: nuclei - galaxies: structure - cosmology: theory\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nUnderstanding the scaling relations between the photometric and kinematic properties of galaxy spheroids \u2013 their\nmasses, sizes, velocity dispersions, and luminosities \u2013 is\nfundamental to explaining the origin of early-type galaxies.\nFaber & Jackson (1976) demonstrated that ellipticals obey a\nrelatively tight correlation between optical luminosity and\ncentral velocity dispersion, and Kormendy (1977) found an\nanalogous relationship between their effective surface brightness and radii. With improved observations and the advent\nof stellar population modeling, these observed trends can be\ntranslated into robust correlations between physical parameters: a velocity dispersion-stellar mass (\u03c3 \u2212 M\u2217 ) and a sizestellar mass (Re \u2212 M\u2217 ) relation.\nDjorgovski & Davis (1987) and Dressler et al. (1987)\ndemonstrated that the scatter in either the Faber & Jackson\n1 Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, MA 02138\n2 W. M. Keck Postdoctoral Fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for\nAstrophysics\n\n(1976) or Kormendy (1977) relation could be reduced by\nadopting a three parameter correlation of the form log (Re ) =\na log (\u03c3) \u2212 0.4 b \u03bce + c (equivalently Re \u221d \u03c3 a Ieb ), with best fit\nscalings a \u223c 1.3 \u2212 1.4, b \u223c \u22120.8 to \u22120.9. This defines the \"fundamental plane\" (FP) of elliptical galaxies: a correlation relating stellar mass or luminosity (implicit in the surface brightness), effective radius, and velocity dispersion (effectively the\ndynamical mass of the system). With a small observed scatter\n\u223c 0.1 dex, the FP has presented as a long-standing, and still\nunresolved challenge to observations and theoretical models\nof spheroid formation.\nIn developing a physical understanding of the FP and\nassociated elliptical scaling laws, Djorgovski et al. (1988);\nJorgensen et al. (1993) and others demonstrated that the FP\ncould be represented as a \"tilted\" virial plane. If ellipticals were perfectly homologous systems with constant stellar mass-to-light ratios M\u2217 /L, then a virial correlation L \u221d\nM\u2217 = k \u03c3 2 Re /G \u2261 Mdyn , with constant integral factor k, would\nbe expected. Since Ie \u221d L/R2e , this translates to an expected\n\"virial FP\" Re \u221d \u03c3 2 Ie\u22121 . The observed FP is similar to this, but\n\n\f2\n\nHopkins et al.\n\nnot exactly so; it is equivalent to and can be represented as a\n\"tilted\" version of this correlation, namely\nMdyn \u221d M\u22171+\u03b1\n\n(1)\n\nwith some small, but non-zero \u03b1. Equivalently, the difference\nbetween the best-fit observed FP (in any projection) and the\nvirial FP can be expressed as a mass dependent mass-to-light\n(or, for our purposes, total mass-to-stellar mass) ratio\nMdyn\n\u221d M\u2217\u03b1\nM\u2217\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the quantity \u03b1 quantifies the tilt, or deviation of the\nFP from the virial relation. Various independent measurements find similar values of \u03b1 \u2248 0.2 (e.g. Pahre et al. 1998;\nGerhard et al. 2001; Borriello et al. 2003; Padmanabhan et al.\n2004; Gallazzi et al. 2006). Although this is not strictly identical to the best-fit relation Re \u221d \u03c3 a Ieb if both a and b are fit\nas free parameters, multiple observations have shown that it\nis statistically an equivalent representation (i.e. has the same\nscatter in physical quantities), and that there is no additional\ninformation in the best-fit FP beyond this tilt (i.e. once this\ntilt is accounted for, there is no additional systematic scaling\nin Re or \u03c3 that can reduce the scatter in predicting the other\nquantities).\nIt is now well-established that part of the observed tilt in\noptical bands is a consequence of stellar population effects:\nlower-mass ellipticals tend to be younger, yielding lower stellar mass-to-light ratios (see e.g. Trager et al. 2000). However,\nvarious constraints imply that only a small fraction of the\noptical tilt owes to these effects (see e.g. Pahre et al. 1998;\nGerhard et al. 2001; Bertin et al. 2002; Borriello et al. 2003;\nPadmanabhan et al. 2004; Trujillo et al. 2004; Gallazzi et al.\n2006; von der Linden et al. 2007). For example, in the Kband, the tilt is still substantial: observations indicate Mdyn \u221d\nL1.25\u00b10.05\n(Pahre et al. 1998), whereas the systematic deK\npendence of M\u2217 /LK is quite weak (most estimates suggest\nM\u2217 /LK \u221d L0.03\nK ; Bell et al. 2003). It is now possible to combine high-resolution spectra and stellar population synthesis\nmodels, allowing reliable stellar mass estimates, and almost\nall such studies yield a similar relation:\nMdyn \u221d M\u22171.2 ,\n\n(3)\n\ni.e. \u03b1 \u2248 0.2 as described above. It has been demonstrated\nthat this result is robust to the details of the stellar population model, spectral coverage, or even simplifying assumptions such as the use of a single color to derive a mean M\u2217 /L.\nThere are only two reasonable explanations for this finding (some combination of the two is also possible). First,\nthe true mass enclosed within the stellar effective radius\n(Mtrue ) could in fact be proportional to the stellar mass M\u2217 ,\nbut owing to e.g. changes in the profile shape or kinematics of galaxies with mass (traditional non-homology), the\nrelation between actual mass and the dynamical mass estimator Mdyn \u221d \u03c3 2 Re /G is a changing function of mass. In\n1.2\nother words, Mdyn \u221d Mtrue\n. However, observations appear\nto rule out this possibility, at least as the origin of most of\nthe tilt. Integral modeling of the mass distribution from twodimensional kinematic maps (which should recover any systematic difference between Mdyn and Mtrue without reference\nto any homology assumptions, e.g. Cappellari et al. 2006), as\nwell as mass distributions estimated from gravitational lensing (Bolton et al. 2007, 2008; Nipoti et al. 2008), indepen-\n\n1.00\u00b10.03\ndently give Mdyn \u221d Mtrue\n. That is, the allowed contribution of non-homology to the FP tilt is small.\nThe only remaining explanation is that the FP tilt reflects a\nmeaningful physical change, namely that the ratio of total enclosed mass within Re (Mtrue , represented reasonably well to\nwithin a normalization constant by Mdyn ) to the stellar mass is\nan increasing function of mass (Mtrue \u221d M\u22171.2 ). In other words,\nlow-mass ellipticals are more baryon-dominated within their\nstellar Re , and high-mass ellipticals have higher dark matter\nfractions. We emphasize that these constraints apply within\nthe stellar effective radii. The change in dark matter fraction\nis not required to be global: if one were to contract the stellar mass distribution but keep the dark matter halo relatively\nfixed, for example, it would significantly decrease the dark\nmatter fraction (and correspondingly Mdyn /M\u2217 ) within Re .\nThis trend is contrary to that followed by disks. For\ndisk galaxies, an opposite (negative) tilt Mdyn \u221d M\u22170.7\u22120.8\n(\u03b1 \u2248 \u22120.2 to \u22120.3) is observed (see e.g. Persic et al. 1996b;\nBell & de Jong 2001; Shen et al. 2003; Courteau et al. 2007)\n\u2013 low mass disks (and dwarf spheroidals) are the most darkmatter dominated systems (Persic & Salucci 1988, 1990;\nPersic et al. 1996a,b; Borriello & Salucci 2001). Such a scaling is expected if the properties of disks track those of\ntheir dark matter halos: lower-mass halos are more compact\n(Neto et al. 2007, and references therein), and it is also wellestablished that lower-mass disks experience less efficient star\nformation (Bell & de Jong 2000; Gallazzi et al. 2005). Consequently, disks and ellipticals have similar ratios Mdyn /M\u2217 at\nhigh masses (\u223ca few L\u2217 ), but disks are more dark-matter dominated (have much higher Mdyn (Re )) at low (stellar) masses.\nThis difference in scaling laws also relates to their stellar sizemass relations: disks obey a shallow relation Re \u221d M\u22170.25\u22120.35 ,\nroughly consistent with the scaling of halo effective radii as\na function of mass, whereas spheroids obey a much steeper\nrelation Re \u221d M\u22170.6 (Shen et al. 2003). Again, at \u223ca few L\u2217 ,\ndisks and ellipticals have similar sizes and densities, but at low\nmasses (\u226a L\u2217 ), ellipticals are smaller (in their stellar/baryonic\nmass distributions) and more dense.\nThis difference has, for \u223c 30 years, represented a major\nchallenge for theory \u2013 especially models which posit that\nellipticals are formed through the merger of disk galaxies\n(the \"merger hypothesis\"; Toomre & Toomre 1972; Toomre\n1977). In particular, it has been noted that purely dissipationless mergers of stellar disks cannot raise the mass and phasespace densities of ellipticals, and so cannot change the scaling\nlaws of ellipticals to something different from disks (Ostriker\n1980; Carlberg 1986; Gunn 1987).\nHowever, these arguments do not pertain if ellipticals are\nformed from mergers of gas-rich disks. Particularly at low\nmasses, where ellipticals are more compact than spirals, disks\nhave a large fraction of their mass in gas, so mergers must\naccount for dissipation. In a merger of two disks containing\nboth gas and stars, the stars are dissipationless and they cannot increase their phase space density and so violently relax to\na distribution with an Re similar to the progenitor disks. Gas,\non the other hand, can radiate, and tidal torques excited during\na merger can remove its angular momentum (Hernquist 1989;\nBarnes & Hernquist 1991, 1996). The resulting inflows produce a dissipational, merger-induced starburst which is compact (typical size scales \u223c 0.5 \u2212 1 kpc). If a significant fraction of the final stellar mass is formed in this manner, the scale\nlength of the stellar component will be much smaller than that\nof its progenitor.\n\n\fDissipation and the FP\nO\u00f1orbe et al. (2005); Robertson et al. (2006b) and\nDekel & Cox (2006) argued that, because low mass disks are\nmore gas rich (on average) than high mass disks, dissipation\nwill be more important in low-mass systems. That is,\nlower-mass ellipticals (the merger products of low-mass\nspirals) should have smaller effective radii relative to their\nprogenitor disks, and, since the halo mass distribution is not\nstrongly affected by this process, a correspondingly smaller\ndark matter fraction (lower Mdyn /M\u2217 ) within the stellar\nRe . On the other hand, high-mass disks are observed to be\ngas-poor: at \u226b L\u2217 gas fractions become negligible (\u226a 10%)\n\u2013 this is precisely where ellipticals are not more compact than\ndisks. Together, Robertson et al. (2006b) and Dekel & Cox\n(2006) argued that the dependence of dissipational fraction\non mass is sufficient, in principle, to explain the tilt of the FP,\nthe size-mass and velocity-dispersion mass correlations of\nellipticals.\nThe importance of gas dynamics and triggered star formation in mergers is reinforced by observations of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) (e.g. Soifer et al.\n1984a,b), which are invariably associated with mergers in the\nlocal Universe (Joseph & Wright 1985; Sanders & Mirabel\n1996). The infrared emission from ULIRGs is thought\nto be powered by intense starbursts in their nuclei, originating in central concentrations of gas (e.g. Scoville et al.\n1986; Sargent et al. 1987, 1989), which will leave dense\nstellar remnants (Kormendy & Sanders 1992; Hibbard & Yun\n1999; Rothberg & Joseph 2004), as predicted theoretically (Mihos & Hernquist 1994a). Moreover, observations\nof merging systems and gas-rich merger remnants (e.g.,\nLake & Dressler 1986; Doyon et al. 1994; Shier & Fischer\n1998; James et al. 1999), as well as post-starburst (E+A/K+A)\ngalaxies (Goto 2005), have shown that their kinematic and\nphotometric properties are consistent with them eventually\nevolving into typical \u223c L\u2217 elliptical galaxies. The correlations\nobeyed by these mergers and remnants (e.g., Genzel et al.\n2001; Rothberg & Joseph 2006a,b, and references above) are\nsimilar to e.g. the observed fundamental plane and Kormendy\n(1977) relations for relaxed ellipticals, and consistent with\nevolution onto these relations as their stellar populations\nage, as well as the clustering and mass density of ellipticals\n(Hopkins et al. 2007b).\nUnfortunately, the consequences of the models are less\nclear; as such, there has been some ambiguity regarding\nwhether or not recent observations of the FP support or\ndisagree with theory. In particular, while merger remnants may fall on the FP, it is not obvious that a differential role of dissipation is in fact responsible for the FP\ntilt in the manner predicted by Robertson et al. (2006b), or\nthat this applies to all ellipticals. However, there is hope:\nMihos & Hernquist (1994a) predicted that these dissipational\nstarbursts should leave an observable signature in the surface\nbrightness profiles of remnants, in the form of a steep departure from the outer de Vaucouleurs (1948) r1/4 -law distribution in the inner regions: i.e. a central \"extra light\" component above the inwards extrapolation of the outer profile.\nObservations have now uncovered distinctive evidence for\nthis two-component structure in local ellipticals (Kormendy\n1999; Kormendy et al. 2008; Ferrarese et al. 2006), classical bulges (Balcells et al. 2007), and recent merger remnants\n(Hibbard & Yun 1999; Rothberg & Joseph 2004). With the\ncombination of HST and ground-based photometry, it now appears that such components are ubiquitous (Kormendy et al.\n\n3\n\n2008), with mass ranges and spatial extents comparable to\nthose expected from observations of ongoing merger-induced\nstarbursts and numerical simulations.\nIn a series of papers, Hopkins et al. (2008d,a,g) (hereafter\nPaper I, Paper II and Paper III, respectively), we used these\nsimulations and data to develop and test a method to empirically determine the degree of dissipation involved in the formation of a particular elliptical galaxy \u2013 i.e. the mass fraction\nin the stellar remnant of a central, compact nuclear (dissipational) starburst. In Paper I, we demonstrated that observed\nmerger remnants can be robustly decomposed into two components: an outer, dissipationless (violently relaxed) component with a Sersic law-like profile, comprising the pre-merger\nstars, and an inner, compact starburst remnant, produced in a\nstarburst. Combining large ensembles of observations with a\nlibrary of simulations that enabled us to calibrate various empirical methods, we developed a purely empirical technique\nto separate the inner \"excess\" owing to the true physical starburst component in the observed surface brightness profile\nfrom the outer profile.\nIn Paper II, we showed that this method \u2013 given photometry of sufficient quality and covering a large dynamic range\n(from . 100 pc to & 20 \u2212 50 kpc) \u2013 could be extended to observed \"cusp\" ellipticals (i.e. ellipticals with steep nuclear\nprofiles), commonly believed to be the direct remnants of gasrich mergers (Faber et al. 1997). Separating the observed surface brightness profile in this manner, we demonstrated that\nsimulations and independent observations (e.g. distinctions in\nstellar populations evident in kinematics, colors, stellar ages,\nmetallicities, or abundances) confirm that the component of\nthe elliptical formed via dissipation (in a nuclear starburst)\ncould be reliably (statistically) determined.\nIn Paper III, we showed that the same methods can robustly\nrecover the dissipational starburst remnants in \"core\" ellipticals (ellipticals with shallow nuclear profiles). In general,\neven if other processes such as e.g. scattering of stars by a\nbinary black hole create the core, their impact on the overall\nstarburst component is negligible (by both mass and radius,\nthe scales of the core, typically . 30 \u2212 50 pc, are much smaller\nthan the mass and size of the starburst). We also showed that\neven if core or other ellipticals have subsequently been modified by spheroid-spheroid \"dry\" re-mergers, profile shape is\npreserved to a sufficient degree that the original nuclear excess\n(i.e. the indicator of the degree of dissipation in the original,\nspheroid-forming merger) remains.\nBy applying our methodology to observations of ellipticals\nover a wide range in mass and size, we can, for the first time,\nempirically compare the degree of dissipation (starburst or\ndissipational mass fraction) in ellipticals to their global properties and locations on the FP. If a differential effect of dissipation as a function of mass is the explanation for the FP\nand elliptical scaling relations, as the models suggest, then\nwe should be able to see and quantify the signatures of this\ndirectly in their observed profiles. Therefore, in this paper\nwe present a critical examination of the relationship between\nspheroid properties and FP correlations and \"extra light\" components, in both simulations and observed galaxies. The combination of a large number of observations, together with an\nensemble of hydrodynamic gas-rich merger simulations sampling the entire observed range in e.g. mass, gas content, and\nother properties, enables us to develop and apply new, detailed, empirical tests of these models for the origin of the FP\ncorrelations.\nIn \u00a7 2 we summarize our library of merger simulations, and\n\n\f4\n\nHopkins et al.\n\nin \u00a7 3 we describe the compilation of observations used to test\nthe models. In \u00a7 4 we review different approaches to fit the\nsurface density profile and recover the physically distinct (dissipational versus dissipationless) components in merger remnants. We use a set of simulations to infer how galaxy properties are predicted to scale with dissipation in \u00a7 5. We then\ncompare with observed systems: examining how observed\nsizes and masses scale with gas content in \u00a7 6, and the scaling\nrelations obeyed at fixed dissipational content in \u00a7 7. We combine the observed dependences on dissipation and gas content\nin \u00a7 8 to determine whether this is sufficient to explain the\ntilt and scatter of the FP and its projected correlations. In \u00a7 9\nwe compare dynamical and total masses and consider possible non-homology effects. In \u00a7 10 we examine the impact of\nsubsequent re-mergers on the FP correlations. Finally, in \u00a7 11\nwe discuss our results and outline future explorations of these\ncorrelations.\nThroughout, we adopt a \u03a9M = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, H0 =\n70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 cosmology, and normalize all observations\nand models accordingly. We note that this has little affect on\nour conclusions, however. We also adopt a Chabrier (2003)\nstellar initial mass function (IMF), and convert all stellar\nmasses and mass-to-light ratios to this choice. The exact form\nof the IMF systematically shifts the normalization of stellar\nmasses herein, but does not substantially influence our comparisons. All magnitudes are in the Vega system, unless otherwise specified.\n2. THE SIMULATIONS\n\nThe merger simulations we analyze in this paper were\nperformed with the parallel TreeSPH code GADGET-2\n(Springel 2005), based on a fully conservative formulation\n(Springel & Hernquist 2002) of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), which conserves energy and entropy simultaneously even when smoothing lengths evolve adaptively\n(see e.g., Hernquist 1993; O'Shea et al. 2005). The simulations account for radiative cooling and optional heating by\na UV background (as in Katz et al. 1996; Dav\u00e9 et al. 1999,\nalthough it is not important for the masses of interest here),\nand incorporate a sub-resolution model of a multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) to describe star formation and supernova feedback (Springel & Hernquist 2003). Feedback\nfrom supernovae is captured in this sub-resolution model\nthrough an effective equation of state for star-forming gas, enabling us to stably evolve disks with arbitrary gas fractions\n(see, e.g. Springel et al. 2005; Springel & Hernquist 2005;\nRobertson et al. 2006a,c). This is described by the parameter qeos , which ranges from qeos = 0 for an isothermal gas with\neffective temperature of 104 K, to qeos = 1 for our full multiphase model with an effective temperature \u223c 105 K. We also\ncompare with a subset of simulations which adopt the star formation and feedback prescriptions from Mihos & Hernquist\n(1994a,c, 1996), in which the ISM is treated as a singlephase isothermal medium and feedback energy is deposited\nin a purely kinetic radial impulse (for details, see, e.g.\nMihos & Hernquist (1994b)).\nAlthough we find that they make little difference to the extra light component, most of the simulations include supermassive black holes at the centers of both progenitor galaxies.\nThe black holes are represented by \"sink\" particles that accrete gas at a rate \u1e40 estimated from the local gas density and\nsound speed using an Eddington-limited prescription based on\nBondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion theory. The bolometric lu-\n\nminosity of the black hole is taken to be Lbol = \u01ebr \u1e40 c2 , where\n\u01ebr = 0.1 is the radiative efficiency. We assume that a small\nfraction (typically \u2248 5%) of Lbol couples dynamically to the\nsurrounding gas, and that this feedback is injected into the\ngas as thermal energy, weighted by the SPH smoothing kernel. This fraction is a free parameter, which we determine as\nin Di Matteo et al. (2005) by matching the observed MBH \u2212 \u03c3\nrelation. For now, we do not resolve the small-scale dynamics of the gas in the immediate vicinity of the black hole, but\nassume that the time-averaged accretion rate can be estimated\nfrom the gas properties on the scale of our spatial resolution\n(roughly \u2248 20 pc, in the best cases). In any case, repeating\nour analysis for simulations with no black holes yields identical conclusions.\nThe progenitor galaxy models are described in\nSpringel et al. (2005), and we review their properties\nhere. For each simulation, we generate two stable, isolated\ndisk galaxies, each with an extended dark matter halo with a\nHernquist (1990) profile, motivated by cosmological simulations (Navarro et al. 1996; Busha et al. 2005), an exponential\ndisk of gas and stars, and (optionally) a bulge. The galaxies\n3\nhave total masses Mvir = Vvir\n/(10GH[z]) for an initial redshift\nz, with the baryonic disk having a mass fraction md = 0.041,\nthe bulge (when present) having mb = 0.0136, and the rest of\nthe mass in dark matter. The dark matter halos are assigned a\nconcentration parameter scaled as in Robertson et al. (2006c)\nappropriately for the galaxy mass and redshift following\nBullock et al. (2001). We have also varied the concentration\nin a subset of simulations, and find it has little effect on\nour conclusions because the central regions of the galaxy\nare baryon-dominated. The disk scale-length is computed\nbased on an assumed spin parameter \u03bb = 0.033, chosen to be\nnear the mode in the \u03bb distribution measured in simulations\n(Vitvitska et al. 2002), and the scale-length of the bulge is set\nto 0.2 times this. Modulo explicit variation in these parameters, these choices ensure that the initial disks are consistent\nwith e.g. the observed baryonic Tully-Fisher relation and\nestimated halo-galaxy mass scaling laws (Bell & de Jong\n2001; Kormendy & Freeman 2004; Mandelbaum et al. 2006,\nand references therein).\nTypically, each galaxy initially consists of 168000 dark\nmatter halo particles, 8000 bulge particles (when present),\n40000 gas and 40000 stellar disk particles, and one black hole\n(BH) particle. We vary the numerical resolution, with many\nsimulations using twice, and a subset up to 128 times, as many\nparticles. We choose the initial seed mass of the black hole\neither in accord with the observed MBH -\u03c3 relation or to be\nsufficiently small that its presence will not have an immediate\ndynamical effect, but we have varied the seed mass to identify any systematic dependencies. Given the particle numbers employed, the dark matter, gas, and star particles are all\nof roughly equal mass, and central cusps in the dark matter\nand bulge are reasonably well resolved. The typical gravitational softening in the simulations is \u223c 20 \u2212 50 pc in the . L\u2217\nsystems of particular interest here, with a somewhat higher\n\u223c 50 \u2212 100 pc in the most massive systems (yielding an effectively constant resolution \u223c 0.01 Re in terms of the effective\nradius). In Paper I and Paper II we demonstrate that this is sufficient to properly resolve not only the mass fractions but also\nthe spatial extent of the extra light components of interest here\n(resolution may become an issue when attempting to model\nthe very smallest galaxies, with Re . 100 pc and L < 0.01 L\u2217 ,\nbut this is well below the range of the observations of interest\n\n\fDissipation and the FP\nhere). The hydrodynamic gas smoothing length in the peak\nstarburst phases of interest is always smaller than this gravitational softening.\nWe consider a series of several hundred simulations of colliding galaxies, described in Robertson et al. (2006b,c) and\nCox et al. (2006a,b). We vary the numerical resolution, the orbit of the encounter (disk inclinations, pericenter separation),\nthe masses and structural properties of the merging galaxies, initial gas fractions, halo concentrations, the parameters\ndescribing star formation and feedback from supernovae and\nblack hole growth, and initial black hole masses.\nThe progenitor galaxies have virial velocities Vvir =\n55, 80, 113, 160, 226, 320, and 500 km s\u22121, and redshifts z =\n0, 2, 3, and 6, and the simulations span a range in final\nspheroid stellar mass M\u2217 \u223c 108 \u2212 1013 M\u2299 , covering essentially the entire range of the observations we consider at all\nredshifts, and allowing us to identify any systematic dependencies in the models. We consider initial disk gas fractions\nby mass of fgas = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 (defined as the fraction of disk baryonic mass which is gas) for\nseveral choices of virial velocities, redshifts, and ISM equations of state. The results described in this paper are based\nprimarily on simulations of equal-mass mergers; however, by\nexamining a small set of simulations of unequal mass mergers, we find that the behavior does not change dramatically for\nmass ratios to about 3:1 or 4:1. The mass ratios we study are\nappropriate for the observations of ellipticals used in this paper, which are only formed in our simulations in major merger\nevents. At higher mass ratios, the result is a small bulge in\na still disk-dominated galaxy (see e.g. Younger et al. 2008;\nHopkins et al. 2008c,f), which we do not study here (although\nin general our conclusions should still apply, so long as the\nbulges of interest are \"classical\" bulges formed in mergers).\nWe also briefly consider in \u00a7 10 a subset of spheroidspheroid \"re-mergers,\" representative of gas-poor or \"dry\"\nspheroid-spheroid mergers of elliptical galaxies. In these\nmergers, we collide two remnants of previous disk-disk mergers, in order to explore how their properties are modified\nthrough re-merging. We typically merge two identical remnants (i.e. two identical copies of the remnant of a given diskdisk merger), but have also explored re-mergers of various\nmass ratios (from 1:1 to \u2248 4:1), and mixed morphology remergers (i.e. merging an elliptical remnant with an un-merged\ngas-rich disk). In the former case, we generally find a similar\ndivision in mass ratio at which a major merger is significant.\nIn the latter, we find that the properties are more akin to those\nof other gas-rich (disk-disk) mergers, and the remnant should\nfor most purposes should still be considered the direct product of a gas-rich merger. In the re-merger series, we vary the\norbital parameters, both of the initial gas-rich merger and remerger, and consider systems with a similar range of initial\ngas fractions in the progenitor disks (of the original gas-rich\nmerger), fgas = 0.05, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8. The re-mergers span a\nsimilar range in virial velocities and final stellar masses to the\ngas-rich mergers.\nEach simulation is evolved until the merger is complete and\nthe remnants are fully relaxed, typically \u223c 1 \u2212 2 Gyr after the\nfinal merger and coalescence of the BHs. We then analyze\nthe remnants following Cox et al. (2006b), in a manner designed to mirror the methods typically used by observers. For\neach remnant, we project the stars onto a plane as if observed\nfrom a particular direction, and consider 100 viewing angles\nto each remnant, which uniformly sample the unit sphere.\n\n5\n\nGiven the projected stellar mass distribution, we calculate the\niso-density contours and fit ellipses to each (fitting major and\nminor axis radii and hence ellipticity at each iso-density contour), moving concentrically from r = 0 until the entire stellar\nmass has been enclosed. This is designed to mimic observational isophotal fitting algorithms (e.g. Bender et al. 1987;\nBender 1988). The radial deviations of the iso-density contours from the fitted ellipses are expanded in a Fourier series\nin the standard fashion to determine the boxyness or diskyness\nof each contour (the a4 parameter). Throughout, we show profiles and quote our results in terms of the major axis radius.\nFor further details, we refer to Cox et al. (2006b).\nWe directly extract the effective radius Re as the projected\nhalf-mass stellar effective radius, and the velocity dispersion\n\u03c3 as the average one-dimensional velocity dispersion within\na circular aperture of radius Re . This differs from what is\nsometimes adopted in the literature, where Re is determined\nfrom the best-fitting Sersic profile, but because we are fitting\nSersic profiles to the observed systems we usually quote both\nthe true effective radius of the galaxy and effective radii of\nthe fitted Sersic components. Throughout, the stellar mass M\u2217\nrefers to the total stellar mass of the galaxy, and the dynamical\nmass Mdyn refers to the traditional dynamical mass estimator\nMdyn \u2261 k\n\n\u03c3 2 Re\n,\nG\n\n(4)\n\nwhere we adopt k = 3.8 (roughly what is expected for a\nHernquist (1990) profile, and the choice that most accurately\nmatches the true enclosed stellar plus dark matter mass within\nRe in the simulations; although this choice is irrelevant as\nlong as we apply it uniformly to both observations and simulations). When we plot quantities such as Re , \u03c3, and Mdyn ,\nwe typically show just the median value for each simulation across all \u223c 100 sightlines. The sightline-to-sightline\nvariation in these quantities is typically smaller than the\nsimulation-to-simulation scatter, but we explicitly note where\nit is large.\n3. THE DATA\n\nWe compare the simulations to and test our predictions\non an ensemble of observed surface brightness profiles of\nellipticals, described in Paper II and Paper III. Specifically, we consider three samples of ellipticals and a compilation of remnants of recent gas-rich mergers. The first\nis the V -band Virgo elliptical survey of Kormendy et al.\n(2008), based on the complete sample of Virgo galaxies\ndown to extremely faint systems in Binggeli et al. (1985)\n(the same sample studied in C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al. 2006; Ferrarese et al.\n2006). Kormendy et al. (2008) combine observations from a\nlarge number of sources (including Bender et al. 1988, 2007;\nCaon et al. 1990, 1994; Davis et al. 1985; Kormendy et al.\n2005; Lauer 1985; Lauer et al. 1995, 2005; Liu et al. 2005;\nPeletier et al. 1990) and new photometry from McDonald Observatory, the HST archive, and the SDSS for each of their objects which (after careful conversion to a single photometric\nstandard) enables accurate surface brightness measurements\nover a wide dynamic range (with an estimated zero-point accuracy of \u00b10.04V mag arcsec\u22122 ). Typically, the galaxies in\nthis sample have profiles spanning \u223c 12 \u2212 15 magnitudes in\nsurface brightness, corresponding to a range of nearly four orders of magnitude in physical radii from \u223c 10 pc to \u223c 100 kpc,\npermitting the best simultaneous constraints on the shapes of\nboth the outer and inner profiles of any of the objects we study.\n\n\f6\n\nHopkins et al.\n\nThe profiles include e.g. ellipticity, a4 /a, and g \u2212 z colors as\na function of radius. Unfortunately, since this is restricted to\nVirgo ellipticals, the number of galaxies is limited, especially\nat the intermediate and high end of the mass function.\nWe therefore add surface brightness profiles from\nLauer et al. (2007a), further supplemented by Bender et al.\n(1988). Lauer et al. (2007a) compile V -band measurements\nof a large number of nearby systems for which HST imaging of the galactic nuclei is available. These include the\nLauer et al. (2005) WFPC2 data-set, the Laine et al. (2003)\nWFPC2 BCG sample (in which the objects are specifically\nselected as brightest cluster galaxies from Postman & Lauer\n(1995)), and the Lauer et al. (1995) and Faber et al. (1997)\nWFPC1 compilations. Details of the treatment of the profiles\nand conversion to a single standard are given in Lauer et al.\n(2007a). The sample includes ellipticals over a wide range of\nluminosities, down to MB \u223c \u221215, but is dominated by intermediate and giant ellipticals, with typical magnitudes MB . \u221218.\nThis therefore greatly extends our sampling of the intermediate and high-mass end of the mass function, but at the cost\nof some dynamic range in the data. The HST images alone,\nwhile providing information on the central regions, typically\nextend to only \u223c 1 kpc outer radii, which is insufficient to\nfit the outer profile. Lauer et al. (2007a) therefore combine\nthese data with ground-based measurements from a number\nof sources (see the references for the Kormendy et al. (2008)\nsample) to construct profiles that typically span physical radii\nfrom \u223c 10 pc to \u223c 10 \u2212 20 kpc. Although the composite profiles were used in Lauer et al. (2007a) to estimate effective\nradii, they were not actually shown in that paper. It should\nalso be noted that there is no single criterion that characterizes\ngalaxies included in this sample, but they generally comprise\nluminous nearby ellipticals and S0 galaxies for which detailed\nimaging is available. We emphasize that issues of completeness and e.g. environment are not important for any of our\nconclusions.\nWe occasionally supplement the profiles from Lauer et al.\n(2007a) with additional profiles used in Bender et al. (1988,\n1992, 1993, 1994), and in some cases subsequently updated.\nThese are more limited: typically the profiles cover \u223c 7 magnitudes in surface brightness, extending from \u223c 30 \u2212 50 pc out\nto \u223c a few kpc (typically \u223c 3 kpc in low-luminosity systems,\nand \u223c 15 kpc in the brightest systems, sufficient for acceptable, but not strong constraints on the outer profile shapes).\nHowever, the measurements are usually in each of the V , R,\nand I bands, and hence allow us to construct multicolor surface brightness, ellipticity, and a4 /a profiles. We use this to\nestimate e.g. the sensitivity of the fitted parameters and galaxy\nprofiles on the observed waveband and on the quality and dynamic range of the photometry.\nWe also consider the sample of local remnants of recent\ngas-rich mergers from Rothberg & Joseph (2004) with which\nwe compare our simulations in Paper I. For these objects,\nRothberg & Joseph (2004) compile K-band imaging, surface\nbrightness, ellipticity, and a4 /a profiles, where the profiles\ntypically range from \u223c 100 pc to \u223c 10 \u2212 20 kpc. These span a\nmoderate range in luminosity (including objects from MK \u223c\n\u221220 to MK \u223c \u221227, but with most from MK \u223c \u221224 to MK \u223c \u221226)\nand a wide range in merger stage, from ULIRGs and (a few)\nunrelaxed systems to shell ellipticals. As demonstrated in\nRothberg & Joseph (2004) and argued in Paper I, these systems will almost all become (or already are, depending on\nthe classification scheme used) typical \u223c L\u2217 ellipticals, with\nappropriate phase space densities, surface brightness profiles,\n\nfundamental plane relations, kinematics, and other properties.\nFor a detailed discussion of the modeling of these systems\nand the profiles themselves, we refer to Paper I (all of the results shown for these systems are derived therein). We show\nthe results from Paper I here in order to test whether observed\nmerger remnants (not just our simulations) obey the same correlations we study in ellipticals. In particular, this allows us to\nprovide an additional empirical check of the simulations and\nthe argued continuity of merger and elliptical populations.\nBecause the generally accepted belief is that core ellipticals were not directly formed in gas-rich major mergers but\nwere subsequently modified by dry re-mergers, we have repeated our analysis considering just those ellipticals which are\nconfirmed via HST observations as being either cusp or core\nellipticals, and designate the two populations as two separate\nsub-samples throughout. However, as we discuss below, treating them as a single population (or including all ellipticals,\neven those without HST observations, in our sample) makes\nno difference to our conclusions. We include all the confirmed\ngas-rich merger remnants, but note there are a small number\nof extreme unrelaxed cases for which sharp features in the\nsurface brightness profiles prevented derivation of meaningful quantities (note, however, as shown in Paper I, that almost\nall of the objects in this sample are sufficiently well-relaxed at\nthe radii of interest for our fitting). We exclude spheroidals, as\nthey are not believed to form in major mergers as are ellipticals (e.g. Kormendy 1985, 1987; Kormendy et al. 2008), and\nin any case they dominate at extremely low masses where our\nsimulations do not sample the population (they also predominate as satellite galaxies, whose effects we do not model).\nWe also exclude S0 galaxies. This is not because of a physical distinction: observations suggest that these likely form\na continuous family with the low-luminosity cusp ellipticals,\nand in fact a number of our simulated gas-rich merger remnants would, from certain viewing angles, be classified as\nS0s (although we exclude disk-dominated simulation remnants from our comparisons here). However, in order to derive\ne.g. the parameters of the outer, violently relaxed profile and\ncentral extra light, it would be necessary to remove the contribution of the large-scale disk from the surface brightness\nprofiles of these objects. Our two-component (outer dissipationless and inner dissipational) Sersic models (described in\n\u00a7 4) then become three-component fits, and the degeneracies\ninvolved with three independent components, even with our\nbest data and simulations, are so large as to render the results\nmeaningless. We have, however, re-visited all of the S0s in\nthese samples in light of our results, and find that they are, in\nall cases, consistent with our predicted and observed trends.\nHowever, it is too difficult to infer these trends directly from\nthe S0s themselves without ideal disk subtraction.\nThis yields a final sample of \u2248 180 unique elliptical galaxies, and \u2248 50 confirmed remnants of gas-rich mergers. Most\nof the sample spans a range of three orders of magnitude in\nstellar mass, from . 0.1 M\u2217 to \u223c 10 M\u2217 , and a wide range in\nextra light properties. There is, of course, some overlap in the\nsamples that define our compilation; we have \u223c 600 surface\nbrightness profiles for our collection of unique ellipticals, including (for many objects) repeated measurements in multiple\nbands and with various instruments. This turns out to be quite\nuseful, as it provides a means to quantify error estimates in\nfits to these profiles. The variations between fit parameters\nderived from observations in different bands or made using\ndifferent instruments are usually much larger than the formal\nstatistical errors in the fits to a single profile. There are no ob-\n\n\fDissipation and the FP\nvious systematic effects (i.e. systematic changes in profile fits\nfrom V to I band), but as demonstrated in Paper I the effects\nof using different bands or changing dynamic range (from different instruments) can be complex, depending on the structure and degree of relaxation of the outer regions of a system.\nOn the other hand, there are well-relaxed objects for which\nalmost no significant change in the fits occurs from band to\nband. It is therefore useful to have multiple observations of\nthe same system, as it allows us to get some idea of how sensitive our fits are to differences in e.g. the choice of observed\nwavelength or dynamic range from instrument to instrument.\nIn Paper II and Paper III, we present the results of our fits to\neach elliptical in our sample; we use these values throughout\nthis paper. For sources with multiple independent observations, we define error bars for each fit parameter representing\nthe \u223c 1 \u03c3 range in parameters derived from various observations, typically from three different surface brightness profiles\nbut in some cases from as many as \u2248 5 \u2212 6 sources (where\nthere are just 2 sources, the \"error\" is simply the range between the two fits). In many cases the different observations\nare comparable; in some there are clearly measurements with\nlarger dynamic range and better resolution: the errors derived\nin this manner should in such cases be thought of as the typical uncertainties introduced by lower dynamic range or less\naccurate photometry.\nIn terms of direct comparison with our simulations, the data\noften cover a dynamic range and have resolution comparable to our simulations, provided we do not heavily weight the\nvery central (. 30 pc) regions of HST nuclear profiles. Experimenting with different smoothings and imposed dynamic\nrange limits, we find it is unlikely that resolution or seeing\ndifferences will substantially bias our comparisons. They can\nintroduce larger scatter, however: the robustness of our results\nincreases considerably as the dynamic range of the observed\nprofiles is increased.\nWe have converted all the observations to physical units\ngiven our adopted cosmology, and compile global parameters (where not available in the original papers) including\ne.g. kinematic properties, luminosities, and black hole masses\nfrom the literature. We determine stellar masses ourselves in a\nuniform manner for all the objects, based on their total K-band\nluminosities and (B \u2212 V ) color-dependent mass-to-light ratios\nfrom Bell et al. (2003), corrected for our adopted IMF. We\nhave also repeated our analysis using stellar masses derived\nfrom a mean M/L as a function of luminosity or from fitting\nthe integrated UBV RIJHK photometry of each object to a single stellar population with the models of Bruzual & Charlot\n(2003), and find this makes no difference to our conclusions.\nThroughout, we will usually refer interchangeably to the\nobserved surface brightness profiles in the given bands and the\nsurface stellar mass density profile. Of course, stellar light is\nnot exactly the same as stellar mass, but in Paper I and Paper\nII, we consider the differences between the stellar light and the\nstellar mass density profiles as a function of time, wavelength,\nand properties of the merger remnant, and show that the optical (V ) and K-band results introduce little bias (i.e. are good\ntracers of the stellar mass). It is important to note that while\nwe are not concerned about the absolute normalization of the\nprofile (i.e. mean M/L), since we derive total stellar masses\nseparately from the integrated photometry, we must account\nfor systematics that might be induced by change in M/L as\na function of radius. The profiles in optical bands such as V\nrequire more care when the system is very young (. 1 \u2212 2 Gyr\nafter the major merger-induced peak of star formation), and\n\n7\n\nthere can be considerable bias or uncertainty owing to stellar\npopulation gradients and dust. However, once the system is\nrelaxed, the optical bands become good proxies for the stellar\nmass distribution, with . 20% variation in our M/L over the\nentire fitted range of radii in our simulations, in good agreement with the simple expectation based on the observed weak\ncolor gradients in most of the observed systems.\nIn fact, in Paper I and Paper II we demonstrate that once the\nsystem reaches intermediate age, the bias in e.g. B or V band\nis often less than that in K band, because systems tend to be\nboth younger and more metal rich in their centers. In K-band,\nthese both increase L/M, leading to a (small) systematic bias.\nOur simulation results indicate that our merger remnant sample (observed in K-band) are, on average, robust in this sense,\nbut they should be treated with care, especially in the most extreme cases (namely the few LIRGs and ULIRGs in the sample). In optical bands, however, age and metallicity gradients\nhave opposite effects (younger age increases L/M, but higher\nmetallicity decreases L/M), and they tend to mostly cancel.\nSince essentially all of our ellipticals observed in the optical\nbands are older than this stellar population age (even in their\ncenters), and they have been carefully vetted and either corrected or (where correction was too difficult) excluded for the\neffects of e.g. dust lanes in the sources (Kormendy et al. 2008;\nLauer et al. 2007a), we are not concerned that significant bias\nmight persist. Furthermore, comparison of systems observed\nin different bands demonstrates that our conclusions are unchanged (modulo small systematic offsets) regardless of the\nobserved bands in which we analyze these systems.\n\n4. INFERRING THE DEGREE OF DISSIPATION FROM OBSERVED\nPROFILES\n\nIn order to test the theoretical models from Robertson et al.\n(2006b) and others using observed systems, we require some\nempirical means to estimate the amount of dissipation involved in forming elliptical galaxies. The simulations imply\nthat the light profile should be considered to be the sum of two\nphysically distinct components. The outer, violently relaxed,\ndissipationless component is made from stars that formed in\nthe disks prior to the final stages of a merger, and therefore\nevolve in a collisionless manner. The inner, \"dissipational\"\ncomponent is comprised of stars produced in a central starburst, from gas which loses its angular momentum in the\nmerger. This gas is channeled into the center of the remnant\nand is converted into stars on a short timescale (effectively in\nan almost fixed background potential set by the already nearly\nrelaxed outer, dissipationless component). The \"degree of dissipation\" is, therefore, effectively measured by the mass fraction of the central, dissipational starburst component, which\ncauses Re to contract and gives rise to the effects described\nabove. In Paper I, Paper II, and Paper III, we develop and test\na methodology for decomposing observed surface brightness\nprofiles into these two components. We refer to those papers\nfor details and verification that this approach is reliable when\napplied to either simulations or observations, but we briefly\nreview the methodology here. We consider two different observable proxies for the amount of dissipation.\nFirst, we directly fit the surface brightness profile to determine the mass fraction in a central \"extra light\" or starburst\ncomponent, which we denote as fextra . We demonstrate in Paper I that this quantity can be measured by fitting the total\nobserved surface brightness profile of merger remnants to the\n\n\f8\n\nHopkins et al.\n\nlog \u03a3 [ MO\u2022 kpc-2 ]\n\n11\n10\n9\n\nPre-Starburst Stars\n(ns = 4.05)\nStarburst Stars\n(fraction = 32.5%)\n\nSersic + Cusp\n\u2206\u03bc = 0.09\nns = 3.76\nExtra Light = +30.9%\n\nPre-Starburst Stars\n(ns = 3.85)\nStarburst Stars\n(fraction = 8.5%)\n\nSersic + Cusp\n\u2206\u03bc = 0.10\nns = 3.94\nExtra Light = + 7.7%\n\n8\n7\n6\n\nlog \u03a3 [ MO\u2022 kpc-2 ]\n\n11\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n2.0\nr1/4 [kpc1/4]\n\n2.5\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n2.0\nr1/4 [kpc1/4]\n\n2.5\n\nF IG . 1.- Left: Surface mass density of a typical merger remnant from our\nsimulation library (black), decomposed into stars formed prior to the final\nmerger (which are then violently relaxed; red) and stars formed in the dissipational starburst (blue). The Sersic index fitted to the pre-starburst component alone is shown, with the mass fraction of the starburst component. We\nshow two examples, one very gas-rich (top) and one less gas-rich (bottom).\nRight: Two-component (Sersic plus cusp or extra light) fit (inner exponential and outer Sersic) to the total light profile, with the Sersic index of the\nouter component and mass fraction of the inner component, and rms scatter\n(\u2206\u03bc) about the fit. Our two-component, cusp plus Sersic function fit (right)\naccurately recovers the profile of the violently relaxed component and mass\nfraction of the starburst component.\n\nfollowing two component model:\n\u0010 r \u00111/n o\nn\n\u0010 r \u0011o\nn\n+ Io exp \u2212 bn\n, (5)\nItot = Iextra exp \u2212 b1\nrextra\nro\nwith the inner part (Iextra , rextra ) serving as a proxy for the\ncentral dissipational component and the outer component (Io ,\nro ) representing the dissipationless outer profile. The \"extra\nlight,\" in other words, is the mass fraction in a high surface\nbrightness central component that rises above the extrapolation of the outer, intermediate ns Sersic law-like profile (which\nin any reasonable model will be dominated by the violently\nrelaxed stars). In Paper I and Paper II, we show that this\nform provides, on average, a reliable physical decomposition\nof the mass distribution in remnants of simulated mergers between gas-rich galaxies, including mass fractions, effective\nradii, and profile shapes of the two components. Analogous\ndecompositions have been applied to e.g. observed bulges in\ndisk galaxies (Balcells et al. 2007) and to Virgo ellipticals,\nmotivated by purely empirical considerations including surface brightness profile shapes, isophotal shape and kinematic\nprofiles, and central stellar populations (see Kormendy 1999;\nKormendy et al. 2008, and references therein), as well as recent merger remnants (Rothberg & Joseph 2004); we refer to\nPaper II for a detailed discussion and comparison with similar\nmethodologies from the literature.\nFigure 1 illustrates this procedure for two typical merger\nremnants from in our simulation library. We show the total surface brightness profile, as well as the known physical\ndecomposition of that profile into a pre-starburst, violently\nrelaxed component and a dissipational starburst component\n(here, we use a cut in time about the peak starburst to identify\nthe \"starburst\" stars, but as shown in Paper I, our results are\nnot sensitive to the exact choice). We compare this with the\nresults obtained by fitting the total profile (temporarily ignoring the known physical decomposition) to a two-component\nmodel of the form given by Equation (5). In both cases, the inner component of our fit is a good proxy for the physical star-\n\nburst light distribution, accurately capturing its mass fraction,\neffective radius, and shape where it is important; i.e. where\nit contributes significantly to the light profile. Likewise, the\nshape (Sersic index), radius, and mass fraction of the dissipationless component are accurately recovered by this purely\nempirical method.\nWe apply this to observed merger remnants in Paper I and\ncusp ellipticals in Paper II, and show that it yields good fits\nwith reliable results. In particular, we find that where there\nis independent evidence for a distinct stellar population (i.e.\na starburst superimposed on a more extended, older stellar\npopulation), this method recovers the empirically estimated\nstarburst population. We demonstrate that other indicators,\nincluding e.g. stellar population gradients, kinematics, and\nisophotal shapes all support the physical nature of these decompositions.\nIn Paper III, we apply this methodology to remnants of gaspoor, spheroid-spheroid re-mergers, and show that, while the\nprofiles are somewhat smoothed out, the general profile shape\nis preserved, and applying this procedure will still reliably recover the original breakdown between dissipational and dissipationless components (i.e. the starburst component formed\nin the original, spheroid-forming merger). We extend our\nanalysis to a large sample of \"core\" ellipticals, and similarly\ndemonstrate the accuracy of this decomposition and agreement with stellar population models (where available); even\nif \"scouring\" by a binary black hole has flattened the profiles\non . 30 \u2212 50 pc scales, the bulk of the \"extra light\" has not\nbeen strongly affected and can still be recovered.\nThis emphasizes an important caveat: the merger history\nand series of induced dissipational events in a given galaxy\nmay be more complex than a single or couple of idealized\nmajor mergers (see e.g. Kobayashi 2004; Naab et al. 2007).\nMoreover, merger-induced starbursts may not be the only\nsource of dissipation; for example, stellar mass loss may replenish the gas supply and lead to new dissipational bursts\n(see e.g. Ciotti & Ostriker 2007). For our purposes, however,\nall dissipational star formation will appear similar when observed and have the same effects \u2013 it is convenient to simulate\nidealized cases, but our results should most appropriately be\nconsidered a measurement of the integrated amount of dissipation (regardless of other details of the merger and dissipational history). Experiments with e.g. more complex merger\nhistories, simulations of multiple simultaneous mergers, and\nseries of dissipational events after \"rejuvenation\" suggest that\nin this sense, our results are robust and independent of the detailed history. Furthermore, the agreement between these estimators and independent observational constraints from stellar\npopulations, kinematics, and isophotal shapes suggest that the\nrecovery is robust.\nSecond, we consider the physical starburst mass fraction fsb\nimplied by directly fitting simulated surface brightness profiles to the observations. In detail, we demonstrate in Paper I,\nPaper II, and Paper III that in our large library of simulations\n(with varying masses, gas fractions, orbital parameters, stellar\nand black hole feedback prescriptions, and other properties)\nthere are remnant surface brightness profiles which (modulo\nsmall offsets in the exact normalization) agree well with the\nobserved profiles over the entire dynamic range of the data.\nConsidering the best fit simulation in each case, we find that\nthere are almost invariably simulations with similar profiles\n\u2013 variance less than \u2206\u03bc = 0.1 mag arcsec\u22122 of the simulated\nprofile with respect to the observed profile (comparable to the\n\n\fDissipation and the FP\n\n5. THE IMPACT OF DISSIPATION: A CASE STUDY\n\nIn previous papers (Robertson et al. 2006b; Dekel & Cox\n2006) argued and Hopkins et al. (2008d,a) demonstrated that\nincreasing the quantity of gas available during the final stages\nof a merger (i.e. increasing the dissipative component of the\nmerger which can collapse to small scales and form stars in\na central starburst) leads to more compact remnants. Because\nof its importance for our analysis here, we use a subset of\nour simulations to highlight the physical significance of this\nresult.\nFigure 2 shows two illustrative surface density profiles of\nmajor merger remnants \u2013 the same cases shown in Figure 1.\nThe initial galaxies were otherwise identical \u223c L\u2217 (Milky\nWay-like) spirals placed on a random orbit, except that in\nthe first example, the progenitor disks had initial gas fractions\n(\u223c 1.5 Gyr before the final merger) of 20%, and in the other\ncase, of 80%. In the two panels, we show the stellar mass\ndensity profile of the final (relaxed) merger remnant, and separately decompose this into two physical components following Mihos & Hernquist (1994a): namely an outer component\ncomprised of those stars that formed prior to the final coalescence of the two disks, and were therefore violently relaxed in the merger, and those stars which formed in the (by\nthen roughly static) center of the galaxy in the final, mergerinduced starburst. They correspond to \u223c 8% and \u223c 30% of the\nfinal total stellar mass in the two simulations, respectively.\nIn both cases, the violently relaxed stars produce an extended profile that is well-described by a Sersic law with index ns \u223c 4. Unsurprisingly, in the example with an initial\ngas fraction \u223c 80%, the central light excess reflecting the final starburst component is much more massive \u2013 however, the\nprofile shape is similar, and this has relatively little effect on\nthe outer light profile (it is slightly more compact, because the\ndense central mass concentration means stars scattered to an\norbit of a given energy will remain at slightly smaller radii in\nthis potential, but this effect is small enough that it is not important). It is clear from Figure 1 that the differences in the\ntwo profiles primarily reflect the mass fraction of the central,\ndissipational component, rather than any change in the dissipationless component. We also show the surface mass density\nof the final dark matter halo. As expected, baryons dominate\nthe density within the central \u223c 1 \u2212 2 kpc of the system, but\nthen trail off. Clearly, the halo mass profile is not very differ-\n\n11\n\nRe(Stars)\n\nRe(Halo)\n\nlog \u03a3 [ MO\u2022 kpc-2 ]\n\n10\n9\n8\n\nHalo\n\n7\n\nStars\n\n6\n1\n\n2\n\nr1/4 [kpc1/4]\n\n3\n\n4\n\n11\n10\nlog \u03a3 [ MO\u2022 kpc-2 ]\n\ninherent point-to-point scatter obtained with arbitrary spline\nfits to the simulated or observed profiles).\nThese matches are insensitive to e.g. orbital parameters,\ndisk initial conditions, or prescriptions for feedback and star\nformation (as expected given the relative independence of the\ninferred dissipational fractions on details of a given merger\nhistory), but good fits to a given observed profile are obtained\nfor only a narrow range in the physical starburst mass fraction fsb (what dependence there is on other parameters tends\nto indirectly reflect this \u2013 varying orbital parameters, for example, can alter the time required for a merger and therefore\nthe mass of gas still available at the time of the final merger to\nparticipate in the central starburst). We demonstrate that we\ncan define a robust and tightly constrained best-fit starburst\nmass fraction, in a \u03c72 sense, from fitting each observed profile to the entire set of simulations. These estimates agree well\nwith the \"extra light\" mass fractions fextra directly determined\nby profile fitting, and with the other indicators we consider,\nlending further confidence to the view that fextra does indeed\nrepresent a physically meaningful indicator of dissipation.\n\n9\n\n9\n8\n\n:\nLess Dissipation\n(fstarburst = 0.08)\n\n7\n\n:\nMore Dissipation\n(fstarburst = 0.31)\n\n6\n\n0.1\n\n1.0\n\n10.0\n\n100.0\n\nr [kpc]\n\nF IG . 2.- Surface density profiles of two simulated gas-rich merger remnants (the same from Figure 1), as a function of radius r (bottom) or r 1/4\n(top). We show both the stellar profile and the dark matter (halo) profile, and\nlabel the effective radii of each (vertical lines). Solid line shows a case with\na moderate degree of dissipation \u2013 a mass fraction in the final, centrally concentrated and dissipational merger-induced starburst fsb = 0.08. Dotted line\nshows a very gas-rich merger remnant, with fsb = 0.31. The profile shapes are\nsimilar (the non-homology effects are weak), and the halos are nearly identical, but the effective radii of the stellar distributions are quite different, owing\nto the dense central concentration of mass from the starburst in the latter case.\n\nent in the two cases.\nDespite the fact that the central mass concentration does\nnot strongly influence the shape and size of the dissipationless remnants of the merger (both the pre-merger, violently\nrelaxed stars which constitute the dissipationless stellar component of the merger, and the dark matter halo), it nevertheless\nrepresents a non-negligible component of the stellar mass, and\ntherefore the effective radius is smaller in the case with 80%\ngas (\u223c 30% of its mass in the final, merger-induced compact\nstarburst component). The resulting difference in Re (for such\na large difference in gas fraction) is dramatic: the effective radius in the case with fsb = 0.08 is \u2248 6.8 kpc, and for the case\nwith fsb = 0.31 it is \u2248 1.4 kpc. In the latter example, nearly\nhalf the mass is actually in the dissipational component, so\nthe effective radius becomes small.\nHow does this effect relate to the ratio of dark matter to\nstellar mass?

There is almost no difference in the scaling of\nthe two simulations \u2013 i.e. the systems appear (in this sense) homologous, but\nthe change in Re is such that evaluating these quantities at Re will give rather\ndifferent answers for the two systems.\n\nof total enclosed mass to total enclosed stellar mass,\nMtot MDM (< r) + M\u2217 (< r)\n=\n.\nM\u2217\nM\u2217 (< r)\n\n(7)\n\nIt is clear that the difference as a function of radius, at least\nfrom \u223c 100 pc to & 50 kpc, is not large between the two simulations (which should not be surprising: the difference in their\nstellar mass density profiles is primarily evident at small r,\nwhere a relatively small fraction of the total mass is enclosed).\nHowever, if we take the value of these ratios within the effective radii Re of the stellar light, we obtain two quite different\nresults. In the gas-rich case, the large central light concentration yields a small effective radius for the stellar light, within\nwhich, for both remnants, the baryons dominate the mass. In\nthe case with less dissipation, and therefore a weaker central component and larger effective radius, the ratio is measured further out (at the larger Re ), where in both simulations\nthere are about equal masses enclosed of both dark matter and\nbaryons.\nTo make a better analogy with observations, we can construct a dynamical mass estimator\nMdyn (< r) \u2261 k \u03c3(r)2 r/G ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere we adopt the factor of k = 3.8 for convenience, as noted\nin \u00a7 2 (making the estimator not so far from the true mass),\n\nand \u03c3(r) is the mean (light-weighted) projected velocity dispersion within a narrow annulus at r. We could also use the\nmean (light-weighted) dispersion within r, h\u03c3(< r)i, which\ngives a similar result (but traces the enclosed mass less faithfully). Figure 3 compares the ratio Mdyn /M\u2217 as a function of\nradius, which yields a similar (albeit noisier) result as considering Mtot /M\u2217 . Again, it is primarily the difference in the\neffective radii at which this quantity is evaluated, rather than\nthe absolute value at fixed r, that drives the difference between\nthe gas rich and gas poor mergers.\nWe obtain the same result using either the true total enclosed mass or a dynamical mass estimator. This implies that\nthere is not substantial kinematic or \"traditional\" structural\nnon-homology between our two merger remnants. We can,\nhowever, check this directly.\nWe compare the ratio Mdyn (r)/Mtot (r) as a function of\nradius in Figure 4. The quantity Mdyn provides a good\ntracer of Mtot , their ratio changing by less than a factor of\n\u223c 2 over three orders of magnitude in radius, and the ratio varies only slightly between the two simulations. The\noverall structure of the system has not been significantly\nmodified \u2013 and in particular over the range of the effective\nradii of the two mergers, there is almost no dependence of\nMdyn (r)/Mtot (r) on either the simulation gas content or radius, consistent with \"isothermality\" implied by observational\nconstraints from gravitational lensing (e.g. Rusin et al. 2003;\nRusin & Kochanek 2005; Jiang & Kochanek 2007). In other\nwords, the increase in the central density of the system owing to the different degrees of dissipation in the two mergers,\nwhile apparent in the nuclear profile in Figure 2, does not represent a sufficiently dramatic change in the total mass profile\nshape to significantly alter the virial constant (i.e. to significantly change the ratio Mtrue (r)/Mdyn (r)). That the estimator\nMdyn is similar across these extreme cases demonstrates that,\ndespite the subtle difference in the strength of the central (dissipational or starburst) component in the stellar light profile,\nthe homology assumption is valid in a purely empirical sense.\nThe role of dissipation in driving tilt in the FP is not, then,\nto introduce substantial structural non-homology (in the sense\nof changing the profile sufficiently to alter the coefficient of\n\n\fDissipation and the FP\n11.0\nlog( Mdyn / MO\u2022 )\n\nlog( M\u2217 / MO\u2022 )\n\n11.1\n10.9\n10.8\n10.7\n10.6\n\n11.0\n10.9\n10.8\n10.7\n\n10.5\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\n\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\n\n7\n6\nlog( \u03c3 / km s-1 )\n\n2.4\n\nRe [kpc]\n\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n\n2.3\n2.2\n2.1\n\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\nfstarburst\n\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\nfstarburst\n\nF IG . 5.- Final stellar mass, dynamical mass Mdyn = k Re \u03c32 /G, effective\nradius, and central velocity dispersion as a function of the dissipational or\nstarburst mass fraction, for three sets of otherwise identical \u223c L\u2217 disk-disk\nmajor mergers with varying initial gas content. Different line styles denote\nvarying orbital parameters. The stellar mass is only weakly affected, but\nthere is a strong scaling of size and dynamical mass (towards smaller sizes\nand correspondingly lower dynamical masses) with increasing dissipation (in\nthe sense seen in Figure 3).\n\nthe virial scalings) or to produce kinematic non-homology,\nbut primarily to decrease the effective radius of the stellar\nlight or mass distribution. At a smaller radius, the more\nstellar-dominated component of the system is sampled, and so\nwhen the traditional dynamical mass estimator is constructed,\n(Mdyn = k \u03c3 2 Re /G) and compared to the stellar mass, the ratio Mdyn /M\u2217 is lower for systems with more dissipation, as\nargued in Robertson et al. (2006b) and Dekel & Cox (2006).\nNote that here \u03c3 is either the central velocity dispersion or the\naverage dispersion within Re (it makes little difference which\nwe consider as long as we do so uniformly, since the dispersion changes weakly with radius).\nOf course, fsb = 0.31 is a rather extreme case, but Figure 5\nshows how the effective radius scales with gas content in another otherwise identical set of simulations of Milky Waylike spiral mergers that span a range in dissipational fraction. The effective radii decrease systematically with dissipational/starburst fraction in a continuous manner. The velocity dispersions do become slightly larger as larger central\nmass concentrations are assembled, but the effect is much\nweaker (\u2206log \u03c3 \u223c 0.15 dex, compared to \u2206log Re \u223c 0.8 dex,\nfor fsb = 0 \u2212 0.5). The result is that the dynamical mass estimated at Re decreases substantially with gas fraction \u2013 again\nowing to the effective radius of the stellar light being drawn\nfurther in \u2013 by \u2206log Mdyn \u223c 0.4 dex from low to high gas\nfraction. Meanwhile, the stellar mass is almost completely\nunchanged, since in any case most of the gas is eventually\nturned into stars, whether in the pre-merger disks or in the\nfinal starburst. So, driven by the increasing dissipation yielding smaller effective radii, the ratio Mdyn /M\u2217 decreases by a\nfactor & 2 \u2212 3 as the gas fraction increases.\n6. ASSESSING THE ROLE OF DISSIPATION IN OBSERVED\nSYSTEMS\n\nHaving illustrated how dissipation can alter the sizes of stellar spheroids and the ratio of dynamical to stellar mass in simulations, we now proceed to apply our analysis to observed\nellipticals.\n\n11\n\n6.1. How Do Observed Sizes Scale with Dissipation?\nFigure 6 shows how effective radius scales with extra light\nmass fextra at fixed mass. We consider three mass bins, below,\nat, and above \u223c M\u2217 . For each, we plot the residual Re relative\nto that expected for the given stellar mass, as a function of the\nfitted extra light fraction. Specifically, we determine hRe (M\u2217 )i\nfrom the sample of Shen et al. (2003), and take the ratio of the\nhalf mass radius of each system (determined directly from the\nlight profile, or from the fits, it does not change the comparison) to that value. Our mass bins are small enough, however,\nthat this makes little difference compared to just e.g. considering Re in a given bin. We show results separately for central\ncusp and core ellipticals, as well as our simulations, although\nthe three distributions are similar.\nThere is a significant trend: at a given stellar mass, systems\nwith fractionally more extra light have systematically smaller\nRe (\u03c3 also rises slightly, but the effect is weaker and there is\nmore scatter at a given fextra , as expected owing to the role of\nthe extended stellar and dark matter distribution in setting the\ncentral potential and \u03c3). In each case, the simulations and observed systems occupy a similar locus. We can also construct\nthis plot with the starburst mass fraction fsb of the best-fitting\nsimulation as the independent variable (instead of the fitted\nextra light mass fractions fextra ), and find a correlation of the\nsame nature. Given two progenitors of known size and mass,\nit is straightforward to predict the size of the remnant of a\ndissipationless merger, simply assuming energy conservation\n(see e.g. Barnes 1988); in the case of a dissipative merger,\nCovington et al. (2008) use the impulse approximation to estimate the energy loss in the gaseous component, followed\nby collapse in a self-gravitating starburst. This yields a detailed approximation as a function of e.g. initial structural and\norbital parameters, but if we assume typical initial disk structural scalings and parabolic orbits, it reduces to the remarkably simple approximation\n\nRe \u2248\n\nRe (dissipationless)\n,\n1 + ( fsb/ f0 )\n\n(9)\n\nwhere f0 \u2248 0.25 \u2212 0.30 and Re (dissipationless) is the radius\nexpected for a gas-free ( fsb = 0) remnant. (A similar estimate\nis obtained by Ciotti et al. (2007) assuming, instead of the impact approximation, a constant fractional dissipational energy\nloss). We plot this in Figure 6, with the scatter seen in the simulations. At all masses, in both simulated and observed cusp\nand core ellipticals, more dissipational ellipticals are smaller\nin the manner predicted.\nThis result directly implies that a structural difference \u2013\nalbeit not traditional structural non-homology \u2013 plays a key\nrole in establishing the fundamental plane tilt. At fixed mass,\nsmaller systems are so because a larger fraction of their mass\nis formed in a central dissipational starburst (to the extent that\nour extra light fractions recover this dissipational component).\nThis dissipational starburst is compact, so even though the\npre-existing stars are distributed to large radii, the effective radius is smaller. In Paper II, we considered the light profiles of\nobserved systems along the Re \u2212 fextra correlation, at fixed stellar mass: it is clear that observed systems at fixed mass with\nthe largest Re show profiles close to a pure Sersic law, with\nlittle evidence for any extra light component at > 0.01 Re (indeed, they have fsb . 0.02). Observed systems in this regime\ncan still be classified as \"cusp\" ellipticals, but the cusps tend\nto be prominent at small radii and (in several cases) somewhat\nshallow, and contribute negligibly to the stellar mass.

We show simulated gas-rich merger remnants (top), observed cusp ellipticals and gas-rich merger\nremnants (middle), and observed core ellipticals (bottom); we use this point notation (key) throughout. We show this in three bins of stellar mass (relative to\nM\u2217 \u2248 1011 M\u2299 , or MV\u2217 = \u221221). Solid (dashed) lines show the mean (\u00b11 \u03c3) correlation, following the analytic solution for dissipational mergers and fits to our\nsimulation in Covington et al. (2008). We show the Spearman rank correlation coefficient and probability of the null hypothesis Pnull (no correlation) in each\npanel. Simulations and observations exhibit the same behavior: systems with smaller Re at fixed mass have systematically larger extra light fractions (in the\nsense predicted by Figure 5 for the starburst/dissipational mass fractions). This implies that, at fixed mass, systems are driven along the fundamental plane by the\nrelative amount of dissipation involved in their formation. This behavior is true regardless of cusp/core status.\n\never, moving to smaller Re and higher fextra at fixed stellar\nmass, deviations from a Sersic law at r \u226a Re become more\nnoticeable. This is not to say that these deviations are universal (that the extra light always takes the same shape/form), but\nthere are increasingly prominent central light concentrations.\nIf the systems were perfectly homologous (in the strict sense\nof the definition), there should be no differences, and there\nshould be no trend whatsoever in Figure 6.\nFigure 6 also shows that there is little difference, in this\nsense, between the size scalings with dissipation of cusp and\ncore ellipticals. We demonstrate this in Paper III, in both simulations and observations. In short, this is expected: even if\nthe systems with cores have expanded via re-mergers, they\nshould (so long as there is not a wide range in number of remergers or strong systematic dependence of the number of remergers on starburst fraction at fixed mass) grow uniformly,\nand preserve these trends. We might expect some normalization offset: if the mean size-mass relation after a gas-rich\nmerger is a power law Re \u221d M\u2217\u03b1 , and two such systems with\nmass ratio f (where f is the mass ratio of the secondary to the\n\nprimary) are involved in a dry merger from a parabolic orbit\n(and preserve profile shape), then the remnant will increase in\nradius by a factor (1 + f )2/(1 + f 2\u2212\u03b1 ) relative to the primary.\nHowever, it has also grown in mass, so compared to ellipticals\nof the same (final) mass, its relative increase in size is only\n(1 + f )2\u2212\u03b1 /(1 + f 2\u2212\u03b1 ). For observationally suggested values\n\u03b1 = 0.56 (Shen et al. 2003), this predicts a \u223c 30% (\u223c 0.1 dex)\nrelative size increase for major re-mergers with mass ratios of\n1:3 through 1:1. This is easily dwarfed by the effects of dissipation seen in Figure 6, which can alter the sizes of systems\nby nearly an order of magnitude at fixed mass. That there\nis not a substantial normalization offset between the trends\nfor cusp and core ellipticals in Figure 6 therefore implies that\ntypical core ellipticals have been involved in only a modest\nnumber of re-mergers (see also Ciotti et al. 2007), but it is not\na strong constraint. The important point is that observations\ndemonstrate the dominant factor controlling the sizes of a ellipticals is the amount of dissipation, even for systems which\nhave undergone re-mergers.\n\n\fDissipation and the FP\n10\n\n1\n\n\u03c1 = -0.41\nPnull = 4.43e-9\nMdyn(Re) / M\u2217(Re)\n\n10\n\n1\n\n\u03c1 = -0.59\nPnull = 3.47e-4\n\n10.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.1\n\n\u03c1 = -0.37\nPnull = 1.83e-4\n0.01\n\n0.10\nfextra light\n\n1.00\n\nF IG . 7.- Ratio of dynamical to stellar mass within Re , as a function of extra\nlight fraction derived from surface brightness profiles. Results are shown\nfor simulated gas-rich merger remnants (top), cusp ellipticals and gas-rich\nmerger remnants (middle), and core ellipticals (bottom). Dotted line shows\nan approximation to the mean simulation trend. We show the Spearman rank\ncorrelation coefficient (\u03c1) for each sub-sample and the probability Pnull of\nthe null hypothesis that there is no correlation between Mdyn /M\u2217 and fextra .\nSystems with larger degrees of dissipation (larger fextra ) have larger ratios\nMdyn /M\u2217 , with high significance, in the sense expected from Figure 5.\n\n13\n\ntheir lower Mdyn /M\u2217 . In Figure 8 we therefore consider this\nsame comparison in narrow bins of stellar mass. We note that,\nwhile there is still some width to our bins, they are sufficiently\nnarrow that we obtain the same answer if we assume that all\nsystems in the bin have the same stellar mass. We also check\na series of Monte Carlo experiments where we assume that\nMdyn /M\u2217 and fextra are both pure functions of Mdyn or M\u2217 ,\nbut have no dependence on each other, and we find that the\nmass bins plotted in Figure 8 are sufficiently narrow that if\nthis null hypothesis were true, then the maximal indirect correlation would have a significance of only \u03c1 \u223c \u22120.1 to \u22120.3\n(with Pnull \u2248 0.2 \u2212 0.8); so a significance Pnull \u226a 0.1 is indeed\nmeaningful. We caution that at a narrow range in stellar mass,\nthere is naturally less observed dynamic range in dissipation\nfraction (as expected, since e.g. disks of a given mass have\na reasonably narrow range of observed gas fractions), and the\nnumber of objects in each bin is smaller, so the significance of\nthe inverse correlation in any one bin will be correspondingly\nreduced. However, we still see an inverse correlation in all\nbins, with significance stronger than expected from the null\nhypothesis. Near \u223c M\u2217 where the sample size is large, the inverse correlation is still highly significant. Further, while the\nsignificance in any one of the plotted bins may be lower owing to the binning, the cumulative significance (i.e. likelihood\nof obtaining such consistent inverse correlations, considering\neach mass bin as an independent subsample) is actually quite\nhigh (Pnull \u226a 10\u22126 ).\nFigures 9 & 10 repeat this test, using the starburst mass fraction fsb estimated from fitting simulations to observed light\nprofiles as the proxy for the dissipational fraction. We obtain\nsimilar answers to our previous comparison using the fitted\nfextra , suggesting that our comparison is not peculiar to the exact estimator used, so long as it robustly recovers the physical\ndissipational component of the galaxy. Again, the cumulative\nsignificance of the inverse correlation \u2013 namely that Mdyn /M\u2217\nis smaller with increasing fsb at fixed mass \u2013 is very high,\nPnull \u223c 10\u22128 .\n\n6.2. How Does This Change Spheroid Dynamical Masses?\n\n7. IS DISSIPATION NECESSARY TO EXPLAIN THE FP?\n\nFigure 7 plots the quantity Mdyn /M\u2217 as a function of the\namount of dissipation, quantified by fextra . The expected trend\nbased on our fiducial cases in \u00a7 5 and the dissipational models (O\u00f1orbe et al. 2005; Robertson et al. 2006b; Dekel & Cox\n2006) is borne out in our library of simulations over a wide dynamic range with fairly small scatter, despite a wide range of\ntotal masses, orbital parameters, initial gas fractions, assumptions regarding the gas pressurization, and other progenitor\nproperties. The same trend obtains for the observed systems,\nwhether cusp or core ellipticals. The scatter is significantly\nlarger among the observed systems, but this is not surprising,\ngiven both the measurement errors involved and the possibility for more complex growth histories that our simulations\ndo not completely model. In a formal sense, the inverse correlation (i.e. smaller Mdyn /M\u2217 at larger dissipational fraction\nfextra ) is highly significant: we plot the Spearman rank correlation coefficient \u03c1 of each sub-sample, together with the\nsignificance of its deviation from zero. This Pnull represents\nthe probability of the null hypothesis of no correlation between Mdyn /M\u2217 and fextra , which is what would be expected\nif systems were perfectly homologous or if extra light did not\ncontract systems and yield smaller Re .\nIt is possible, in principle, that the observed correlation\ncould be indirect. For example, if lower mass systems happened to have higher fextra , but it had no causal connection to\n\nThese comparisons, while demonstrating that the dissipational mass fraction does indeed correlate with the sizes and\nratio Mdyn /M\u2217 in observed ellipticals (and therefore that it\ncould be the source of the tilt in the FP) do not necessarily indicate how much of the FP tilt derives from dissipation. To test\nthis, we construct the fundamental plane in Figure 11 \u2013 specifically the correlation between Mdyn and M\u2217 \u2013 in bins of similar\nfitted \"extra light\" mass fractions fextra (i.e. we consider the\nFP for systems only with similar amounts of dissipation). Because we are binning by extra light mass and still attempting\nto fit a correlation, we include both cusp and core ellipticals\nin the observed sample. Separating the two gives identical\nresults, but the significance is reduced owing to the limited\ndynamic range from further splitting the sample at fixed fextra .\nWe fit a power-law to the data (and separately, to our simulations) in each bin, of the form Mdyn \u221d M\u22171+\u03b1 (Equation 1),\nwhere \u03b1 is the FP \"tilt.\" Because neither Mdyn nor M\u2217 should\nproperly be considered an independent variable, we quote the\nresults from fitting the least-squares bisector to the correlation. However, this makes little difference (the least-squares\nbest-fit Mdyn (M\u2217 ) and M\u2217 (Mdyn ) relations are both consistent\nand agree). We show this using the typical estimator Mdyn\nhere, but have also considered the true total enclosed mass\nMtrue within Re and find identical results (as expected, since\nwe show in \u00a7 5 and \u00a7 9 that Mdyn is a good proxy for Mtrue ).\n\n\f14\n\nHopkins et al.\n\nMdyn(Re) / M\u2217(Re)\n\n10\n\n11.2 - 11.6\n\n11.6 - 12.2\n\n1\n\u03c1 = -0.51\nPnull = 6.12e-2\n\n0.01\n\n10\nMdyn(Re) / M\u2217(Re)\n\n10.8 - 11.2\n\n\u03c1 = -0.50\nPnull = 9.50e-3\n\n0.10\n\n10.3 - 10.8\n\n1.00\n\n0.01\n\n\u03c1 = -0.57\nPnull = 2.05e-3\n\n0.10\n\n10.8 - 11.2\n\n1.00\n\n0.01\n\n0.10\n\n1.00\n\n11.2 - 11.6\n\n1\n\u03c1 = -0.42\nPnull = 2.13e-3\n\n0.01\n\n0.10\nfextra light\n\n\u03c1 = -0.58\nPnull = 1.39e-6\n\n1.00\n\n0.01\n\n0.10\nfextra light\n\n\u03c1 = -0.37\nPnull = 2.18e-3\n\n1.00\n\n0.01\n\n0.10\nfextra light\n\n1.00\n\nF IG . 8.- As Figure 5, but in narrow bins of stellar mass (range in M\u2217 for each bin shown in the upper right of each panel).

The results\nare similar.\n\nThe results are unambiguous in both our simulations and\nthe observed systems. The tilt in any given bin is negligible \u2013\nwithin 1 \u03c3 of \u03b1 = 0 in every case. In other words, at fixed fextra ,\nwe recover the virial correlation with constant Mdyn /M\u2217 . Note\nthat in several of these bins the dynamic range in mass is still\n\nlarge (\u223c 2 \u2212 3 orders of magnitude in M\u2217 ), and the number of\nobserved systems is sufficiently large that if a substantial tilt\nlike that observed for the entire population (\u03b1 \u223c 0.2) were\npresent in the bin, we should see it. This is reflected in the\nquoted errors, which show that the tilt in most bins is inconsistent with that observed for the global population at \u223c 3 \u03c3\nsignificance (in the sense that it is much smaller, consistent\nwith a pure virial correlation). If we combine the data (i.e.\nnormalize out the mean Mdyn /M\u2217 at each bin in fextra and fit,\nor take the cumulative significance of the bins shown) we obtain \u03b1 = 0.028 \u00b1 0.040, consistent with zero and \u223c 4 \u2212 5 \u03c3 below the observed tilt for the entire population.\nFigure 12 repeats this exercise, using the starburst mass\nfraction fsb (estimated from the physical starburst mass fractions in the best-fitting simulations) as the proxy for dissipational mass fraction, instead of the fitted extra light fraction\nfextra . In either case we reach identical conclusions for both\nthe simulations and observations. The inferred tilt at fixed\ndissipational fraction is always consistent with zero, in some\ncases scattering to \u03b1 < 0 (i.e. the opposite sense of what is\nobserved; but again these are all consistent with \u03b1 = 0). In\nshort, we have demonstrated empirically that without invoking some systematic dependence of dissipational fraction on\nmass, there is no FP tilt. Dissipation is observationally necessary to explain the FP tilt.\nFigure 13 also shows this for the effective radius projection of the fundamental plane. We obtain identical answers in\nthis case (for both simulations and observations) but note that\nthe sense of the correlation is such that, if the baseline in Re\nis comparable to the scatter in observed points, severe biases\ncan be introduced. We see this reflected in the fact that, in this\ncase, fitting Re (Rpred ) versus Rpred (Re ) (where Rpred \u221d \u03c3 2 Ie\u22121 is\nthe virial expectation) yield rather different slopes. Therefore,\nwhile we show our simulations (which have small dispersion\nin Re across sightlines), we refrain from fitting the observations in such narrow bins in this particular projection of the\nFP.\n8.

This already implies that dissipation must be responsible for the majority of the tilt. But\nif we knew how much dissipation was expected as a function\nof galaxy mass (i.e. the mean expected mass fraction in a dissipational starburst, for mergers of systems of a given mass),\nwe could entirely predict the FP and its tilt.\nFigure 14 shows the mean dissipational mass fractions of\nboth cusp and core ellipticals, as a function of mass, derived\nin Paper II and Paper III.

Initial gas fraction (top) and\nphysical final starburst mass fraction (bottom) corresponding to the best-fit simulations to each observed system in the samples of Lauer et al. (2007a) (circles)\nand Kormendy et al. (2008) (stars) are shown, with the typical 25 \u2212 75% allowed range (error bar). We show results separately for cusp ellipticals (left), core\nellipticals (center), and both together (right). Dashed (solid) line shows the fit to the data (Equation 10) in cusp (core) ellipticals. Colored points with error\nbars indicate the mean (and \u00b11 \u03c3 range in) disk gas fractions at the same stellar mass, at z = 0 (Bell & de Jong 2001; Kannappan 2004; McGaugh 2005, blue\ndiamonds, squares, and circles, respectively), z = 1 (Shapley et al. 2005, green squares), and z = 2 (Erb et al. 2006, orange circles). There is a clear trend of\nincreasing dissipation required to explain elliptical profiles at lower masses (significant at > 8 \u03c3 in either core or cusp subsamples separately), in good agreement\nwith the observed trend in progenitor disk gas fractions over the redshift range where cusp ellipticals are formed, and with what is invoked to explain the observed\ndensities and fundamental plane correlations of ellipticals (e.g. Kormendy 1989; Hernquist et al. 1993). The best-fit trends in cusp and core populations are\nstatistically identical: i.e. the dissipational/extra light component is preserved regardless of possible re-mergers.\n\ntematically higher dissipational mass fractions. To the extent\nthat Mdyn /M\u2217 depends on dissipational fraction ( fextra or fsb ),\nthen, the existence of a systematic dependence of fextra and\nfsb on mass will yield a systematic dependence of Mdyn /M\u2217\non mass. We can use the observed dependence of the dissipational mass fraction on mass to predict and empirically\nestimate the amount of tilt in the FP contributed by systematic trends in dissipation as a function of mass. For convenience, we noted in Paper II that the dependence of dissipational fraction fsb on mass in cusp ellipticals (or observed gasrich merger remnants) can be well-fitted by\nh \u0010 M \u0011\u03b1 i\u22121\n\u2217\n,\n(10)\nh fstarburst i \u2248 1 +\nM0\nwith (M0 , \u03b1) = (109.2\u00b10.2 M\u2299 , 0.43 \u00b1 0.04) (shown in Figure 14), and a roughly constant factor \u223c 1.5 \u2212 2 scatter\nat each M\u2217 . In Paper III we demonstrated that an essentially identical scaling (a statistically equivalent (M0 , \u03b1) =\n(108.8\u00b10.3 M\u2299 , 0.35 \u00b1 0.05)) applies to core ellipticals, as expected if cusp ellipticals are indeed their progenitors (since\nidentical re-mergers will conserve dissipational or \"extra\nlight\" mass fractions).\nWe also demonstrated in Paper II and Paper III that this\nempirically measured systematic dependence of dissipational\nmass fraction on stellar mass agrees well with the observed\ndependence of disk galaxy gas fractions on mass. This is\n\nexactly what is expected if ellipticals are (at least originally) formed in gas-rich, disk-disk mergers (regardless of\nwhether or not they subsequently experience re-mergers). We\nshow this in Figure 14 with the observed disk gas fractions\nas a function of stellar mass from Bell & de Jong (2001);\nKannappan (2004); McGaugh (2005) at z = 0, as well as at\nz = 1 (Shapley et al. 2005) and z = 2 (Erb et al. 2006). At all\nthese redshifts, the trend of gas fraction is similar, and the observed gas fractions evolve relatively weakly with redshift (by\na factor \u223c 1 \u2212 2), bracketing the range of dissipational mass\nfractions observed in ellipticals at each mass.\nIn other words, regardless of the exact times of formation,\na systematic trend similar to that observed in the dissipational\nfractions of ellipticals is inevitable if disks are the progenitors\nof ellipticals. Note that even if there is a systematic dependence of the time of first gas-rich merger on stellar mass in\nthis range, the mixing of formation redshifts would be less\nimportant than the mean dependence of disk gas fraction on\nmass (if we assume the stellar population ages date the merger\ntimes \u2013 which is an upper limit to the magnitude of this effect,\nsince the stellar ages at least in part reflect the similar trend in\nstellar ages of disks as a function of mass \u2013 then the systematic effects added by this age scaling are not important). The\ndependence of disk gas fractions on mass is therefore the primary driver of the observed dependence of dissipational mass\nfraction on elliptical mass.\n\n\fDissipation and the FP\nAmong other things, this implies that we could predict the\ndissipational mass fractions of ellipticals as a function of their\nmass, based on the observed disk gas fractions at each mass.\nWe therefore pursue the following exercise: we consider the\nconsequences of adopting the observed scaling of disk gas\nfractions with mass as our expectation for the dissipational\nfractions in ellipticals as a function of mass. Since we have\njust shown they are equivalent, we obtain identical results if\nwe select the empirically fitted dissipational fractions of ellipticals as a function of mass; in either case, the important\nthing is that there is a well-defined, physically motivated and\nobservationally confirmed systematic scaling of dissipational\nfraction with mass.\n8.2. The Consequence for the FP\n\nGiven the known scaling of disk gas fractions as a function\nof mass, we can then focus on the subsample of simulations\nthat obey this scaling. That is, at a particular mass scale, we\nknow the range of disk gas fractions seen empirically. We\ntherefore consider only simulations within that range of gas\nfractions, as opposed to others in our library that are more gas\nrich or gas poor than typical observed disks of the same stellar mass. We have considered the effects of redshift evolution\n(using the mean age of ellipticals as a function of their stellar\nmass as a proxy for their merger time, we adopt the gas fraction of disks of the appropriate mass at that redshift), and find\nit makes relatively little difference (although some secondary\ncorrelations along the FP relating to stellar populations and\nthe age of systems will be discussed in \u00a7 11.2). This restriction imposes a mean dependence of extra light or starburst\nmass fraction on stellar mass similar to that observed in ellipticals and anticipated from disk gas fractions. Given this constraint, we can consider the FP and other correlations obeyed\nby just these objects: i.e. we can ask the question: What are\nthe scalings obeyed by systems that have the same systematic\ndependence of dissipational fraction on mass as expected and\nobserved in the real Universe?\nFigure 15 shows the results of this exercise. Now that we\naccount for the cosmologically expected and observed dependence of dissipational content on mass, the FP is \"tilted.\"\nFitting a power law, we obtain a value for this tilt of \u03b1 =\n0.19 \u00b1 0.02. We compare this to the observed systems, plotting the data on the same footing, since we have constructed a\ncosmologically representative comparison sample in our simulations. We obtain an observed tilt of \u03b1 = 0.21 \u00b1 0.05, the\ncanonical value in the literature. More important (since any\nformal fitted tilt will vary if fit over different dynamic range),\nwe compare the predicted scaling directly to actual ellipticals,\nand find that the simulations and observed systems occupy a\nstatistically identical locus in Mdyn \u2212 M\u2217 space. As a check, we\nfit the Kormendy et al. (2008) and Lauer et al. (2007a) subsamples independently, and obtain consistent values for the\ntilt.\nWe show the tilt again in terms of Re , and obtain a similar result (for this projection, the formal tilt value is expected\nto be similar to that for Mdyn \u2212 M\u2217 ). Fitting the observed samples, we find that they trace an identical locus \u2013 but the powerlaw fits in this case are more sensitive to dynamic range (apparent by the fact that the formal tilt from Kormendy et al.\n(2008) and Lauer et al. (2007a) are slightly discrepant, despite the points tracing each other where they overlap). As\ndiscussed above, caution should be used fitting in this FP projection (here, the dynamic range is much larger than the fit\nerrors in Re , so there are not large biases introduced in such\n\n17\n\nobservational fits, but in a more limited subsample, results fitted in this fashion are less robust than those fitted in the more\nphysical Mdyn \u2212 M\u2217 space, where the axes are independent).\nGiven the larger uncertainties in this case, the agreement is\nreasonable. Note that the absolute values of M\u2217 and Mdyn and\nzero-points here are sensitive to our adopted virial coefficients\nand IMF assumptions, but the tilt and our meaningful comparisons are not.\nFigure 16 compares this result with the samples divided\ninto cusp and core ellipticals. For both classes of objects, the\nagreement with the simulations is good, and the two appear\nto trace a continuous FP correlation. This is not surprising:\nit has been shown that massive, boxy ellipticals with cores\ntrace a continuous FP with less massive, disky, cuspy ellipticals (at least at the massive end, where most of the core population resides; see Gerhard et al. 2001; von der Linden et al.\n2007), and we have shown that the scaling of Mdyn /M\u2217\nwith dissipational fraction (and systematic dependence of dissipational fraction on mass) are similar in both cusp and\ncore ellipticals (and, in simulations in Paper III, we explicitly demonstrate that this should be true for both the original gas-rich merger remnants and dry re-merger remnants).\nFurthermore, a number of studies (Capelato et al. 1995;\nDantas et al. 2003; Nipoti et al. 2003; Boylan-Kolchin et al.\n2005; Robertson et al. 2006b) have shown that dissipationless spheroid-spheroid re-mergers (popular as a mechanism\nfor producing cores in ellipticals) tend to preserve the FP, provided that the number of re-mergers is modest; we discuss\nthese issues further in \u00a7 10.\nGiven that the FP tilt in Figure 15 arises owing to dissipation \u2013 where we have shown in Figure 11 that at the same degree of dissipation, the virial correlation (no tilt) is recovered\n\u2013 it should be possible to explicitly factor out at least some\nof this tilt. Figure 17 attempts this exercise: we determine\nthe best-fit bivariate function Mdyn (M\u2217 , fextra ). For simplicity\nand to minimize the free parameters involved, we (for now)\nb\n,\nadopt a simple power-law parameterization Mdyn \u221d M\u2217a fextra\nand determine the best-fit parameters a and b such that the\nperpendicular scatter (i.e. scatter about the least-squares bisector) is minimized; we then repeat this using the estimated\nstarburst mass fraction fsb instead of the fitted extra light fraction fextra . In both cases, and regardless of whether we fit to\nthe observations or to the simulations, the best-fit correlation\nis essentially the virial correlation (i.e. a \u2248 1) coupled with a\ndependence on fextra or fsb . In other words, the best-fit bivariate FP assigns the FP \"tilt\" entirely to the role of dissipation\n\u2013 at fixed degree of dissipation, there is no tilt. Explicitly including the degree of dissipation in this manner demonstrates\nthat it is indeed \"as fundamental\" as any bivariate correlation (it is preferred with respect to a purely mass-dependent\nMdyn /M\u2217 ). These fitted FP projections are nearly identical to\nthe simplest predicted FP in dissipation-driven models (also\nshown in Figure 17): namely, that Mdyn \u221d M\u2217 F( fextra ), where\nthe function F( fextra ) \u221d Mdyn /M\u2217 has the form seen in Figure 7\n(note that this is more complex than a simple power-law).\nIn principle, this explicit inclusion of an fextra or fsb dependence should be able to account for some of the scatter in the\nFP, and therefore might provide a plane with smaller scatter.\nIn practice, the scatter in e.g. Mdyn (M\u2217 , fextra ) is only slightly\nreduced relative to that in just Mdyn (M\u2217 ). The reasons for this\nare twofold. First, as discussed in \u00a7 8.4, the majority of the\nscatter in the FP owes not to different degrees of dissipation\nbut to the combination of sightline-to-sightline variations, dis-\n\n\f18\n\nHopkins et al.\n1.5\n\n11\nMdyn \u221d M\u2217\nMdyn \u221d M1.19\n\u2217\n\n10\n\nlog(Re) [kpc]\n\nlog(Mdyn/MO\u2022)\n\n12\n\n11\nlog(M\u2217/MO\u2022)\n\n0.5\nRe\u221d\u03c32I-1\ne\n0.80\nRe\u221d(\u03c32I-1\ne)\n\n0.0\n\nTilt = 0.19 \u00b1 0.02\n\n10\n\n1.0\n\nTilt = 0.20 \u00b1 0.03\n\n-0.5\n\n12\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n2log(\u03c3) - log(Ie) + C\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\nlog(Re) [kpc]\n\nlog(Mdyn/MO\u2022)\n\n12\n\n11\n\nTilt = 0.21 \u00b1 0.05\nTilt = 0.23 \u00b1 0.07\nTilt = 0.20 \u00b1 0.06\n\n10\n\n10\n\n11\nlog(M\u2217/MO\u2022)\n\n12\n\n1.0\n0.5\nTilt = 0.23 \u00b1 0.07\nTilt = 0.35 \u00b1 0.09\nTilt = 0.17 \u00b1 0.09\n\n0.0\n-0.5\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n2log(\u03c3) - log(Ie) + C\n\n1.5\n\nF IG . 15.- The FP for all observed ellipticals (bottom), in the style of Figure 11 (left) and Figure 13 (right), with the measured tilt (black for all observed points;\nred and violet show the tilt fitted for the Kormendy et al.

Accounting for the systematic dependence of dissipation on mass (owing to the dependence of gas content on mass in the\nprogenitor disks), we obtain a FP tilt in good agreement with that observed, with comparable small scatter.\n1.5\n\nlog(Mdyn/MO\u2022)\n\nlog(Re) [kpc]\n\n12\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n\n11\n\n10\n\n-0.5\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n2log(\u03c3) - log(Ie) + C\n\n1.5\n\n10\n\n11\nlog(M\u2217/MO\u2022)\n\n12\n\n10\n\n11\nlog(M\u2217/MO\u2022)\n\n12\n\n1.5\n\nlog(Mdyn/MO\u2022)\n\nlog(Re) [kpc]\n\n12\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n\n11\n\n10\n\n-0.5\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n2log(\u03c3) - log(Ie) + C\n\n1.5\n\nF IG . 16.- The observed FP, compared with our simulation predictions as\nin Figure 15, but divided into core (top) and cusp (bottom) ellipticals. The\nsimulation predictions agree well with the data in both cases, consistent with\ntheoretical modeling that even a modest number of re-mergers do not move\nsystems significantly off the FP correlation established by the original, gasrich mergers.\n\npersion in progenitor disk properties, and measurement errors.\nSecond, as discussed in \u00a7 4 and Paper II, an estimator such as\nfsb or fextra is of course not a perfect tracer of the true starburst\nmass fraction; with typical factor \u223c 2 uncertainties. In practice, then, most of the reduction in scatter from factoring out\nfextra is negated by scatter introduced in the variation between\nfextra and the \"true\" starburst mass fraction. The result is that\nthe scatter in the FP in terms of M\u2217 and fextra is comparable to\nor slightly less than that in terms of M\u2217 alone. Owing to the\nuncertainties in estimating fextra , then, this FP representation\n\nis not necessarily a substantially improved observational predictor of Mdyn or e.g. Re at fixed \u03c3 and M\u2217 . However, the FP\nin these terms is certainly comparable to the \"traditional\" FP\nin how tightly it relates Mdyn and M\u2217 , and it is \"more fundamental\" in terms of a physical explanation for the FP tilt.\nBecause our primary focus in this paper is the understanding of the observed z = 0 FP correlations, we reserve a more\ndetailed modeling of the evolution of the physical FP (in terms\nof e.g. stellar and dynamical mass) with redshift (as e.g. typical merger histories and progenitor gas content evolve) for\nfuture work (Hopkins et al. 2008e). For now, we simply note\nthat the evolution in physical parameters considered here is\npredicted to be weak, in agreement with direct observational\nconstraints from high redshift weak lensing (Heymans et al.\n2006) and optical studies (note that there is expected evolution in optical bands owing to stellar population effects; these\nrepresent complimentary constraints on elliptical formation\nhistories; see e.g. di Serego Alighieri et al. 2005; Treu et al.\n2005; van der Wel et al. 2005; van Dokkum & van der Marel\n2007). To the extent that these constraints agree with our expectations based on empirical estimates for the evolution of\ndisk gas fractions, they represent independent support for the\nscenario outlined here.\n8.3.

If the observed\nFP was more complex than a tilt (e.g. if M\u2217 depended substantially on Re or\n\u03c3 separately at fixed Mdyn ), our results would disagree here. The agreement\nis good, as expected based on observations that the FP is, essentially, a tilted\nvirial plane.\n\nFP were much more complex than a simple tilt (i.e. if M/L\ndepended substantially on Re or \u03c3 at fixed Mdyn ), then the\nsimulations might match the observations in Figures 15-21\nbut not in this representation. In fact, we find good agreement with the observations. This is not surprising, since it has\nbeen established that the FP can be represented as a tilt under some homology assumptions (e.g. Jorgensen et al. 1996;\nPadmanabhan et al. 2004).\nFigure 19 plots projections of the FP; specifically, the\nsize-mass relation and the velocity dispersion-mass (FaberJackson) relation.

We show the size-mass (top) and velocity\ndispersion-mass (Faber-Jackson; bottom) correlations, for the same subset of\nsimulations used in our FP predictions in Figure 15 (left) and observations\n(right). The observed mean relations for SDSS ellipticals (solid lines; with\n\u223c 95% range as dashed lines) are shown over the range of data used in the observed fits (Shen et al. 2003; Gallazzi et al. 2006, for size-mass and velocity\ndispersion-mass, respectively). Note the curvature in both relations, owing to\nthe dependence of dissipation on mass and its role in setting both Re and \u03c3.\nThe simulations and observations agree with each other and with the mean\ncorrelations observed in much larger samples; i.e. once systems with the appropriate range of dissipational fraction for their mass are selected, they follow the observed size-mass and other correlations. The relations would not\nagree if we used systems with significantly different dissipational fractions as\na function of mass.\n\nsimulations used to construct the FP in Figures 15-18; since\nwe showed in \u00a7 6.1 that e.g. effective radii scale systematically with dissipational fraction, a robust prediction of the\nsize-mass relation requires that the simulations considered\nhave appropriate dissipational fractions for systems of their\nstellar mass. We show sizes and velocity dispersions as a\n\n\f20\n\nHopkins et al.\n\nfunction of stellar mass because this is how these correlations\nare generally presented in the literature, but differences are\nsmall and the comparison with observations is similar if we\nconsider them as a function of dynamical mass.\nWe compare with the same correlations in the observed\nsamples for which we consider the FP, and with the mean\ncorrelations measured for ellipticals in the SDSS. The simulations agree well with the observations \u2013 both those that\nwe consider in our FP analysis, and the trends in the general\npopulation (it is also reassuring that our observed FP samples\nobey the same projected scalings, with similar scatter). The\nscatter in these correlations is larger than that between Mdyn\nand M\u2217 , since at fixed Mdyn there is a tradeoff between Re and\n\u03c3. It is also interesting to note that the trends show significant curvature \u2013 their combination (Mdyn \u2212 M\u2217 ) is reasonably\napproximated by a power-law scaling, but either the Re \u2212 M\u2217\nor \u03c3 \u2212 M\u2217 slope will vary with the fitted mass interval (for this\nreason, we refrain from quantifying a power-law fit to either\nthe simulations or observations, but we note that if we do so\nover the same mass interval for both, we obtain the same result).\nThis has been discussed in the literature, for both the\nRe \u2212 M\u2217 and \u03c3 \u2212 M\u2217 relations (see e.g. Lauer et al. 2007b;\nvon der Linden et al. 2007; Desroches et al. 2007) (note that\neven Shen et al. (2003) see tentative evidence for this effect\nin their lowest-mass bins, but their dynamic range at the low\nmass end is limited). We note here that such curvature can\narise even from pure gas-rich merger remnants, owing to the\ndependence of the amount of dissipation on mass and corresponding scalings of size and velocity dispersion. This is\nsupported by the fact that both our cusp and core sub-samples\nindependently exhibit similar curvature. It has also been observed that non-BCG and BCG galaxy samples show similar\ncurvature (despite the latter being much more likely to have\nexperienced dry mergers; see e.g. de Lucia & Blaizot 2007).\nThis is not to say that re-mergers will not introduce curvature\nin these relations or move systems considerably with respect\nto them (see e.g. Boylan-Kolchin et al. 2006), but rather to\nemphasize that dry re-mergers are not the only source of curvature in the relations, and curvature should not necessarily\nbe interpreted as evidence for dry mergers (further note that\nsystems cannot move too far off their initial correlations, as\nthey are constrained by the observed scatter).\nIt is well-established that these correlations are different\nfrom those obeyed by spiral galaxies. If we do crudely\napproximate the correlations as power-laws (for illustrative\npurposes) over the dynamic range shown in Figure 19, we\nobtain correlations Re \u221d M\u22170.56 (as in Shen et al. 2003) and\n\u03c3 \u221d M\u22170.25 (see e.g. Bernardi et al. 2003), also yielding Re \u221d\n\u03c3 2.0\u22122.2 . Compare these to the observed relations in disks:\n1.0\u22121.2\nRe \u221d M\u22170.30\u22120.35 , Vmax \u221d M\u22170.27\u22120.30 , and Re \u221d Vmax\n(see e.g.\nPersic et al. 1996b; Courteau et al. 2007; Avila-Reese et al.\n2008). These differences relate to the tilt of the FP and the\nfundamental distinctions at issue here: at high masses, ellipticals and disks have similar sizes, but at low masses, ellipticals\nare much smaller. The difference, in our simulations, arises\nbecause of changes in the degree of dissipation, reflected in\nthe extra light content. In principle then, it should be possible to consider the resulting correlations between Re and M\u2217\nor \u03c3 in terms of the combination of their dependence on that\nvariable and the additional dependence on fextra or fsb .\nFigure 20 shows the results of this exercise: we consider Re\nas a bivariate function of combinations of M\u2217 , \u03c3, and fextra .\n\nThe correlation Re (M\u2217 , \u03c3) represents the \"traditional\" FP correlation \u2013 that the correlation is not simply Re \u221d M\u2217 /\u03c3 2 reflects the \"tilt\" of the FP. If instead we fit Re to a combination of M\u2217 and fextra , we obtain a fit of similar quality (i.e.\nthis combination is an equivalent predictor of Re ), but with\n\u22120.57\nthe dependence Re \u221d M\u22170.3 fextra\n. This is an equivalent FP\nin terms of its usefulness as a predictor of Re , with a scatter\n\u223c 0.15 \u2212 0.20 dex. More interesting, the explicit dependence\nof Re on M\u2217 fitted in this manner is identical to that observed\nin disks (Re \u221d M\u22170.3 ), with the remaining dependence owing to\nthe dependence of Re on fextra . Given the cosmological scaling of fextra with M\u2217 , we obtain the steeper Re \u221d M\u22170.6 relation\nfor ellipticals when fextra is ignored, but at fixed fextra or fsb\n\u2013 i.e. fixed degree of dissipation \u2013 a relation Re \u221d M\u22170.3 , similar to that observed in disk galaxies, is observed (in line with\nthe predictions from Robertson et al. 2006b). We obtain the\nsame results for the size-velocity dispersion relation: a best\u22120.39\n\u22120.89\nfit Re \u221d \u03c3 1.33 fextra\n(or Re \u221d \u03c3 0.94 fextra\n); the dependence of\nRe on \u03c3 at fixed fextra or fsb is very similar to the dependence\nof Re on rotational velocity Vmax in disks (to lowest order, our\nsimulations and other numerical experiments demonstrate that\n\u03c3 traces the pre-merger Vmax , modulo a roughly constant normalization offset owing to e.g. the profile shape and kinematics). In other words, the difference between the observed sizemass-velocity dispersion relations in disks and ellipticals can\nbe entirely accounted for by dissipation.\n8.4. The Small Scatter in the FP\n\nA final requirement for any model of the FP is that it account for the small observed scatter. Analyzing the relations\npredicted by the simulations, which broadly sample orbital\nparameters and stellar masses, and fully cover the observed\nrange of dissipational fractions at each mass, we can see directly in Figures 15-21 that there is small scatter. Formally,\nwe find a nearly symmetric 1\u03c3 scatter of \u223c 0.07 \u2212 0.08 dex in\nMdyn (M\u2217 ) or \u223c 0.065 \u2212 0.075 dex in M\u2217 (Mdyn ) (0.055 dex scatter perpendicular to the best-fit correlation \u2013 or equivalently\nin the Re projection of the FP \u2013 depending weakly on how\nwe define our expected fextra (M\u2217 ) and whether we use Mtrue\nor Mdyn ). This is the scatter obtained in these correlations using the median values of M\u2217 and Mdyn for each galaxy (across\n\u223c 100 sightlines): if we include the sightline-to-sightline variance in the simulations, we obtain \u223c 0.14 dex total scatter in\nMdyn (M\u2217 ) (0.09 dex scatter perpendicular to the correlation).\nThis is still less than that observed in each case: for the observed samples herein, we find \u223c 0.18 dex scatter in Mdyn (M\u2217 )\nand \u223c 0.15 dex scatter in M\u2217 (Mdyn ); i.e. a perpendicular scatter of 0.12 dex, with additional observational errors in Re and\nM\u2217 (estimated from our experiments in Paper II) likely contributing most of the difference (for typical \u223c 0.1 dex stellar\npopulation model errors in M\u2217 , this yields roughly the observed scatter).\nThe origin of the small intrinsic scatter in the FP is straightforward to understand in this scenario. Some intrinsic variation will come from the scatter in the total baryon-to-darkmatter content of the progenitor galaxies. However, observations of the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation suggest that the\nscatter in M\u2217 at fixed maximum circular velocity (a proxy\nfor halo mass) is small, \u2248 0.1 dex (at least over the mass\nrange of interest here; Bell & de Jong 2001). Even considering the total baryon-to-halo mass ratios, which extend well beyond Re and are therefore of less interest, observations imply\nquite small scatter \u223c 0.15 dex (Wang et al. 2006; Conroy et al.\n\n\flog(Re) [kpc]\n\nDissipation and the FP\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n-0.5\n\n-0.5\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.25log(M\u2217) - 2.73log(\u03c3) + C\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\nlog(Re) [kpc]\n\n21\n\n-0.5\n-0.5\n\n1.5\n\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n0.30log(M\u2217) - 0.57log(fextra) + C\n\nNo fsb Dependence: Re\u221dM0.6\n\u2217\nDisks: Re\u221dM\n\n-0.5\n\n1.5\n\n0.3\n\u2217\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n-0.5\n\n-0.5\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.20log(M\u2217) - 2.52log(\u03c3) + C\n\n1.5\n\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.33log(\u03c3) - 0.39log(fextra) + C\n\n1.5\n\nNo fsb Dependence: Re\u221d\u03c32.0\nDisks: Re\u221dV1.1\nmax\n\n-0.5\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n0.30log(M\u2217) - 0.73log(fsb) + C\n\n1.5\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n0.94log(\u03c3) - 0.89log(fsb) + C\n\n1.5\n\nF IG . 20.- FP predictors of Re . Left: Re as a function of the \"traditional\" global parameters M\u2217 (stellar mass) and \u03c3 (velocity dispersion). Simulations (the\nsame as used for the predicted FP in Figure 15) and observations are shown (as in Figure 7). The scatter in Re in this projection is \u223c 0.2 dex. Center: Re as a\nbivariate function of M\u2217 and fitted extra light fraction ( fextra , top) or inferred starburst fraction ( fsb , bottom). This is an equivalent or better observational predictor\nof Re (scatter \u223c 0.15 dex). Right: Re as a function of \u03c3 and fextra (top) or fsb (bottom). Again, this is an equivalent predictor (scatter \u223c 0.2 dex). Ignoring the\neffects of dissipation, we recover the Re \u2212 M\u2217 and \u03c3 \u2212 M\u2217 relations in Figure 19, with very different slopes from the relations for disks (comparison shown here).\nHowever, with the effects of dissipation explicitly included here, the relation between Re and M\u2217 or Re and \u03c3 is equivalent to that obeyed by spirals \u2013 i.e. the\ndifference between the \"projected\" elliptical and spiral scaling relations is entirely attributable to the degree of dissipation ( fextra or fsb ).\n\n2006; Weinmann et al. 2006). This effectively subsumes a\nnumber of quantities, including e.g. scatter in the initial radii\nof the disks at fixed mass, in halo concentrations, and in other\nparameters (note that the scatter in any one of these quantities is not important, given that the final Tully-Fisher relation\nscatter is small). The contribution of this initial scatter will\nactually be reduced after a gas-rich merger, because the quantity of interest is the ratio [M\u2217 /2 + Mdm (< Re )]/(M\u2217 /2). Since\nthe merger channels gas into the center and raises the central density, the final effective radius is smaller (explaining\nthe smaller sizes of ellipticals relative to spirals at low mass).\nThus, while M\u2217 is just the baryonic mass of the progenitor,\nthe contraction of the remnant makes the relative value of\nMdm (< Re ) smaller, reducing the importance of initial scatter\nin Mdm /Mbaryon to the final FP scatter. Analysis of the simulations suggests that a realistic initial \u223c 0.1 dex scatter in the\nbaryonic Tully-Fisher relation contributes . 0.04 \u2212 0.05 dex\nscatter directly to the final FP prediction.\nHowever, there will be additional intrinsic scatter contributed by different degrees of dissipation in systems of the\nsame mass. Figures 6 & 8 shows that at fixed stellar mass, systems with different degrees of dissipation have correspondingly different effective radii and ratios Mdyn /M\u2217 . However,\nthe scatter in the expected (and observationally inferred) dissipational fraction at each mass is small, a factor . 2, and\nthe dependence of Mdyn /M\u2217 (see Figure 7) on dissipational\nfraction over this relatively narrow range is not strong. Combining this scatter with the dependence of Mdyn /M\u2217 , we expect it to contribute about \u223c 0.06 \u2212 0.08 dex of intrinsic scat-\n\nter. Together, this yields the relatively small \u223c 0.08 dex intrinsic scatter in Mdyn (M\u2217 ) (before sightline-to-sightline and\nmeasurement errors).\n9. TOTAL VERSUS DYNAMICAL MASS: INVARIANCE OF THE FP\n\nIn Figure 21 we repeat our experiment from Figure 15;\ni.e. we construct the FP from the simulations, given the observed and expected dependence of dissipational fraction on\nmass. However, instead of plotting the traditional dynamical mass estimator Mdyn \u221d \u03c3 2 Re , we plot the true total projected mass (stellar plus dark matter plus gas, although gas\nis generally negligible) within Re , which we extract directly\nfrom the simulations and refer to as Mtrue . The predicted FP\nis nearly identical to that predicted using the Mdyn estimator\n\u2013 i.e. the FP predicted does, in fact, arise from a change of\nthe dark-to-luminous-matter ratio within Re , owing to dissipation contracting the stellar effective radius (i.e. a change\nin Mtrue /M\u2217 with mass), rather than to traditional structural or\nkinematic non-homology (which would imply a constant ratio\nof Mtrue /M\u2217 , with a changing apparent mass from the dynamical mass estimator; i.e. a varying Mtrue /Mdyn with mass).\nThis is despite the systematic variation of extra light fraction with mass (reflecting the systematic dependence of dissipational or initial disk gas fraction). In other words, while\nthere is technically a subtle non-homology implicit in the fact\nthat the dissipational fraction depends on mass (and, as a result, the fitted fextra and fsb change with mass, whereas they\nwould be constant for true perfectly self-similar systems), it\ndoes not contribute any significant or observationally meaningful structural or kinematic non-homology.

(2006), who\nuse integral Jeans/Schwarzchild modeling to determine a \"true\" mass independent of a homology or constant M/L assumption. A nearly identical tilt\nis predicted and observed \u2013 i.e. the predicted and observed FP is really a\nreflection of the tilt in Mtrue /M\u2217 within Re , not a tilt in Mtrue /Mdyn .\n\nassumption,\" namely that the ratio of the dynamical mass estimator to the true enclosed mass within the effective radius\n(Mtrue /Mdyn ) is constant, is predicted to hold, while the FP is\nsatisfied.\nFigure 22 demonstrates this explicitly: we plot the ratio of\ntrue enclosed mass to the dynamical mass estimator, specifically for the same simulations we used to predict the FP\nand its tilt. The ratio Mtrue /Mdyn is constant despite chang1+\u03b4\ning dissipational fractions; fitting a power law Mtrue \u221d Mdyn\n,\nwe obtain \u03b4 = \u22120.01 \u00b1 0.01 (both insignificant and completely\nnegligible compared to the observed value of the FP tilt,\n\u03b1 \u2248 0.2); i.e. the \"homology assumption\" is valid in the observational sense as applied to these simulations, and there is\nno significant implied systematic structural or kinematic nonhomology (in the traditional sense of the term) as a function\nof mass.\nWe compare these predictions with observed \"true\" enclosed masses within the effective radii of observed systems, using two different approaches for estimating the true\nenclosed mass (without explicitly invoking the homology\nassumption). First, Cappellari et al. (2006) estimated total masses from three-dimensional Schwarzchild modeling\nor two-dimensional Jeans modeling of local ellipticals with\ntwo-dimensional velocity field information from SAURON\nmaps (see also Emsellem et al. 2007; McDermid et al. 2006;\nCappellari et al. 2007), and used stellar population models\nto estimate stellar masses (we correct these for the choice\nof IMF, but otherwise do not modify them). We also have\n\n10\n\n11\nlog[ Mdyn / MO\u2022 ]\n\n12\n\nF IG . 22.- Top: The correlation between the dynamical mass estimator\nMdyn = 3.8 \u03c32 Re /G and the true total mass Mtrue (stellar plus dark matter)\nenclosed within Re (as in Figure 21), for the same simulations shown in our\n1+\u03b4 , with\npredicted FP (Figure 15). Dashed line is a fit of the form Mtrue \u221d Mdyn\nthe best-fit value of \u03b4 shown: the best fit is indistinguishable from the Mtrue =\nMdyn line (i.e. has no \"tilt\"). Bottom: Same, for the observed systems from\nFigure 21, using integral modeling (Cappellari et al. 2006, magenta squares)\nor lensing mass maps (Bolton et al. 2007, 2008, orange triangles) to estimate\n1+\u03b4 are shown for each\nthe true mass Mtrue . The best-fit coefficients Mtrue \u221d Mdyn\nobserved sample. The simulations we use to predict the FP, and the observed\nsystems on the FP, trace a nearly identical Mtrue \u221d \u03c32 Re relation consistent\nwith the traditional observational definition of the \"homology assumption.\"\n\nconsidered integral modeling masses from other, independent\nsources (e.g. van der Marel 1991; Kronawitter et al. 2000;\nH\u00e4ring & Rix 2004) and obtain identical results in each case.\nFigure 21 plots the FP of these objects; i.e. the true enclosed\nmass determined in this manner as a function of stellar mass.\nThe tilt, in agreement with the simulations, is nearly identical to that given by the dynamical mass estimator Mdyn . This\nis clear in Figure 22, where we compare the predicted correlation between Mdyn and Mtrue with these observations (we\napply the same definition of Mdyn to the observed objects as\nto the simulations, namely Mdyn = 3.8 Re \u03c3 2 /G). As noted by\nCappellari et al. (2006), there is a tight correlation between\nMdyn and Mtrue without any significant deviation in this space\nfrom the homology assumption (\u03b4 = +0.012 \u00b1 0.019). Not\nonly does this tight proportionality (\u03b4 \u2248 0) agree with our simulations, but the normalization fitted to the observed sample,\ni.e. mean ratio Mtrue \u2248 3.8 Re \u03c3 2 /G, agrees with that predicted\nby the simulations over the observed mass range to better than\n0.03 dex, further suggesting that the structural properties and\nprofile shapes of the simulations are in good agreement with\nthose observed.\nSecond, Bolton et al. (2007, 2008) have performed a similar exercise, but using instead the enclosed masses determined from gravitational lensing. We compare their FP (i.e.\nMtrue (M\u2217 )) in Figure 21, and again find similar tilt to that\npredicted by the simulations (using the true enclosed mass\n\n\fDissipation and the FP\n\n12.0\nlog[ Mdyn / MO\u2022 ]\n\nwithin Re as Mtrue ) and to that obtained using Mdyn instead\nof Mtrue . Figure 22 shows that, for these objects as well,\nMtrue \u221d Mdyn (\u03b4 = \u22120.004 \u00b1 0.034 \u2248 0), with again a normalization (mean Mtrue /Mdyn ) in agreement with the simulations\nto within 0.02 dex. Note that the authors restricted themselves\nto true masses and dynamical masses within Re /2; if we use\ntheir lens models to correct the true masses to Re and take\nthe corresponding dynamical masses at that radius, we obtain\nidentical results.\nThe simulations reproduce the observed, nearly exact proportionality between Mtrue and Mdyn , and therefore show the\nsame FP behavior as has been seen in the observations:\nnamely that the FP tilt remains similar regardless of whether\nMdyn or Mtrue is considered. This demonstrates the point from\n\u00a7 5, that non-homology (in the general, observationally motivated sense of different Mtrue /Mdyn as a function of galaxy\nproperties) is not a significant contributor to the FP tilt.\n\n23\n\n11.5\n\n11.0\n\n10.5\n10.0\n\n10.5\n\n11.0\nlog[ M\u2217 / MO\u2022 ]\n\n11.5\n\n12.0\n\n1.0\n\n10. RE-MERGERS AND FP EVOLUTION\n\n0.8\nFraction\n\nThe predictions we seek to test, and the observed dependence of FP tilt on the degree of dissipation which we have\ndemonstrated, hold in the same manner for both cusp and core\nellipticals. However, a number of observed properties (see\ne.g. Faber et al. 1997) suggest that core ellipticals may be the\nproducts of subsequent \"dry\" or spheroid-spheroid, relatively\ngas-free re-mergers of (generally lower-mass) cusp ellipticals\n(formed directly in gas-rich mergers). If true, do we expect\nthe level of agreement we see?\nThe answer is generally yes, provided that the number\nof re-mergers is not large. Numerical experiments (e.g.\nCapelato et al. 1995; Dantas et al. 2003; Nipoti et al. 2003;\nBoylan-Kolchin et al. 2005; Robertson et al. 2006b) indicate\nthat remnants of dissipationless mergers of systems which begin on the FP tend to remain on the FP. Even if the re-merger\nintroduces no new tilt, its effects would be small. To lowest\norder, since the gas is mostly exhausted, the re-merger will be\ndissipationless, and merging two identical systems M1 and M2\non a parabolic orbit, one expects their profiles to be roughly\npreserved. This leads to the energy conservation equation\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n-0.10 -0.05 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20\nLog[ (Mdyn/M\u2217)final / (Mdyn/M\u2217)initial ]\n\n(11)\n\nF IG . 23.- Top: Impact of subsequent spheroid-spheroid re-mergers on the\nFP. We show the observed FP from Figure 15 (black line), with the initial and\nfinal positions of simulated systems before and after a major re-merger (point\nstyle as Figure 15; lines connect each re-merger to its progenitor). Bottom:\nThe cumulative distribution in relative dynamical to stellar mass ratio before\nand after a major re-merger, in our entire ensemble of re-merger simulations.\nVertical dashed (dotted) line shows the median (\u00b11 \u03c3) change in Mdyn /M\u2217 .\nRe-mergers tend to slightly increase Mdyn /M\u2217 , by almost exactly the amount\nneeded to move parallel to the FP (0.06 dex), but with non-negligible scatter\n(\u223c 0.065 dex).\n\nwhere \u03c3 f is the velocity dispersion of the final remnant, and\nk is a constant that depends on the shape of the profile. From\nthis, one obtains the general rule that a major 1:1 merger will\napproximately double Re while preserving \u03c3, doubling both\nMdyn and M\u2217 (e.g. Hausman & Ostriker 1978; Hernquist et al.\n1993).\nRelative to the FP scaling, Mdyn \u221d M\u22171.2 , the remnant is now\n\u223c 0.06 dex below the FP expectation \u2013 only \u223c 0.3 \u2212 0.5 \u03c3 (\u03c3\nbeing the observed FP scatter). So even if the system increases\nits mass by a total factor of \u223c 4 \u2212 5 via dry re-mergers (i.e. has\n\u223c two equal-mass re-mergers or \u223c 5 \u2212 6 more typical 1:3 mass\nratio re-mergers), it will move by only \u223c 1 \u03c3 with respect to\nthe FP.\nCompare this to the impact of dissipation, which as we\ndemonstrate in \u00a7 6 can change the effective radius and ratio\nMdyn /M\u2217 (at fixed stellar mass) by nearly an order of magnitude. We therefore expect that, unless a system has experienced an extreme number of major dry re-mergers (expected\nonly for the rarest, most massive central cluster galaxies), the\ndegree of dissipation (i.e. properties we study herein) should\nbe the dominant factor determining the effective radii, ratio of\ndynamical to stellar mass, and location with respect to the FP.\n\nFurthermore, it has been noted (Boylan-Kolchin et al. 2005,\n2006; Ciotti et al. 2007) that re-mergers can slightly increase\nMdyn /M\u2217 , essentially causing systems to move nearly parallel to the FP. We consider a sample of re-merger simulations,\ndescribed in \u00a7 2, in order to demonstrate this in Figure 23.\nSpecifically, these are identical (mass ratio 1:1) re-mergers\nof remnants of previous gas-rich, disk-disk mergers, merged\nin various orbital configurations. The details are discussed\nin \u00a7 2, but we note that although we plot only identical remergers here (for illustrative purposes), the results scale appropriately for different mass ratios and various mixed encounters (i.e. merging different spheroid remnants of similar\nmass). Plotting both the pre and post-remerger systems on\nthe FP in Figure 23, we see that they move nearly parallel\nto the fitted relation (\u03b1 \u2248 0.2). Quantitatively, the median\nincrease in dynamical to stellar mass ratio is \u223c 0.06 dex, precisely as needed to move the system along the FP (to offset the\n\u223c 0.06 dex offset from the FP estimated above, if Mdyn /M\u2217\nwere exactly conserved in a re-merger).\nThis effect is subtly related to e.g. changes in the orbital\nisotropy and kinematics of the remnant in a re-merger, but\nprimarily owes to a real (albeit small) physical increase in the\n\nE f = k (M1 + M2 ) \u03c3 2f = Ei = k M1 \u03c312 + k M2 \u03c322\n\n\f24\n\nHopkins et al.\n\nratio of enclosed dark matter mass within the stellar effective radius (the progenitors and remnants obey the \"homology assumption\" as in Figure 22, and we see an almost identical effect plotting the true enclosed mass instead of Mdyn ).\nConsidering the initial and final distributions of stellar and\ndark matter particles as a function of their initial radius, it is\nstraightforward to understand this effect.\nDespite the nearly uniform inflation of the light profile in\na re-merger, there is substantial scattering of stars (and dark\nmatter): i.e. although stars at some initial ri will be, at the end\nof the merger, at a median r f \u2248 2 ri , the distribution of final\nradii will be approximately lognormal with scatter \u2248 0.4 dex\n(see Paper III). The integrated stellar mass will be constant,\nbut such a scattering will tend to broaden the dark matter\ndistribution in a way that slightly increases the dark matter\nmass within the stellar Re \u2013 i.e. scatter some dark matter from\nnear the effective radius of the halo to both smaller and larger\nradii (total dark matter mass is conserved, but the densities are\nslightly lower near the halo effective radius \u2013 which is much\nlarger than the galaxy effective radius which concerns us here\n\u2013 and slightly higher at much smaller and larger radii). This\nwill slightly raise the central dark matter density, in a way\nconsistent with the observed (weak) change in Mdyn /M\u2217 in remergers (effectively mixing slightly more dark matter into the\nstellar distribution). The net effect of this is that re-mergers\nmove systems even less with respect to the FP, and dissipation\nis still the dominant factor setting Mdyn /M\u2217 .\nFigure 23 also demonstrates that although re-mergers tend,\nin the mean, to increase Mdyn /M\u2217 such that they move parallel\nto the FP, there is significant scatter in the change in Mdyn /M\u2217\nin re-mergers (in detail, the median increase is 0.06 dex, but\nthere is a 1 \u03c3 scatter of \u223c 0.065 dex about this median). We\ntherefore expect that growing a population of ellipticals by a\nfactor \u223c 2 in re-mergers (equivalent to a single 1:1 or three 1:3\nre-merger for most of the objects in the population) will contribute \u223c 0.06 dex intrinsic scatter in Mdyn (M\u2217 ). Compared\nto the intrinsic scatter (in terms of sightline-averaged quantities) of \u223c 0.08 dex, this is significant, yielding a final intrinsic\nscatter of \u223c 0.10 dex. However, after accounting for the additional \u223c 0.1 dex sightline-to-sightline scatter, and observational effects, the contributed scatter is negligible compared\nto the final observed \u223c 0.18 dex scatter in Mdyn (M\u2217 ). That\nthe observed scatter is not much larger does suggest there has\nnot been dramatic re-merging, but the constraint is weak \u2013\nit would take \u223c 4 \u2212 5 major (mass ratio 1:1) dry mergers (or\n\u223c 10 more likely 1:3 dry mergers) to noticeably increase the\nobserved FP scatter at the massive end.\n11. DISCUSSION\n\nWe have developed and implemented a set of observational tests of the theoretical proposal that different degrees\nof dissipation are responsible for the tilt in the fundamental\nplane, (suggested in e.g. Djorgovski et al. (1988); Kormendy\n(1989); Bender et al. (1992); Ciotti et al. (1996) and developed in numerical simulations in Bekki (1998); O\u00f1orbe et al.\n(2005); Robertson et al. (2006b) and Dekel & Cox (2006)).\nWith measurements of the surface brightness profiles of ellipticals of sufficient accuracy and high dynamic range, we\ndemonstrated in Paper I-Paper III that it is possible to design\nan empirical decomposition which reliably separates the dissipational (original merger-driven starburst) and dissipationless (scattered stars from the original stellar disks) components of galaxy light profiles. Applying this to a large sample\nof observed ellipticals, we study here how their FP correla-\n\ntions relate to the mass fractions in the dissipational (or \"extra\nlight\"/starburst) component.\nWe show that systems with larger dissipational fractions\nhave smaller effective radii for their stellar masses and lower\nratios of total (stellar plus dark matter) mass to stellar mass\nwithin their effective radii (equivalently, lower Mdyn /M\u2217 ) \u2013\ni.e. that dissipation can and does move objects onto the FP, in\nthe manner predicted by Robertson et al. (2006b). More important, we show that without the effects of a systematic dependence of the degree of dissipation on mass, there is no significant FP \"tilt\". In other words, systems with the same dissipational/starburst fractions, even over a wide range in mass\n(\u223c 2 \u2212 3 dex), exhibit a constant ratio Mtrue \u221d M\u2217 . Dissipation\nnot only can tilt systems on the FP, it is required to explain\nthe FP tilt.\nThe tilt originates because of an expected systematic dependence of dissipational content on mass, arising because\nlower-mass disks (the progenitors of lower-mass ellipticals in\nthis scenario) tend to be more gas rich. Therefore, lower-mass\nsystems will, on average, undergo more dissipational mergers. This appears to be true even out to redshifts z \u223c 2 \u2212 3,\nso that the exact formation times of the systems are not especially important. Quantitatively, if we convolve the expected\ndependence of dissipational fraction on mass (from e.g. the\ndependence of gas fraction on disk mass, or from the clear\nmean systematic trend we see in the fits to the observed ellipticals) with the dependence of Mdyn /M\u2217 on dissipational\nfraction, we obtain a prediction for the FP which is \"tilted\" in\na manner similar to that observed, Mdyn \u221d M\u22171.2 .\nOf course, merger-induced starbursts may not be the only\nsource of dissipation; for example, stellar mass loss may replenish the gas supply and lead to new dissipational bursts\n(see e.g. Ciotti & Ostriker 2007). Moreover, the merger history and series of induced dissipational events may be more\ncomplex than a single or couple of idealized major mergers\n(see e.g. Kobayashi 2004; Naab et al. 2007). For our purposes, however, all dissipational star formation will appear\nsimilar when observed and have the same effects \u2013 we are\nessentially measuring the integrated amount of dissipation,\nand testing the idea that the presence of this dissipation can\nexplain the difference between spheroid and disk scaling relations. In any case, the result is the same, and the agreement with disk gas fractions over the redshift range of interest\nsuggests star-forming galaxies are viable candidates for the\nultimate progenitor systems of ellipticals (however complex\nthe details of the morphological transformation may be). In\nshort, the systematic dependence of the degree of dissipation\non mass in elliptical formation is both necessary and sufficient\nto explain the FP tilt.\n11.1. Possible Sources of Tilt: Why Dissipation is the Only\n\nViable Possibility\nThis conclusion is, to our knowledge, consistent with all\nexisting observational constraints on the FP. We note that\nrepeating our experiments with alternative IMFs affects\nonly the normalizations of the quoted relations; considering alternative stellar evolution models such as those of\nLeitherer et al. (1999) or Maraston (2005), compared to\nthe default calibration from Bruzual & Charlot (2003) in\nBell et al. (2003) makes no difference, since ellipticals are\nalmost all relatively old and the model differences focus on\nyoung stellar populations. Assuming, therefore, that there\nis not some dramatic error in the stellar population models\nor the observed effective radii, then there are only a limited\n\n\fDissipation and the FP\nnumber of possible explanations for the FP \"tilt.\"\nNon-Homology: Technically, this refers to systems being\nnot perfectly self-similar. This must be broken in any model\nin which there is a dependence or \"tilt\" in the physical mass\nwithin some radius and the stellar mass M\u2217 . In practice,\nthe more practical meaning of \"homology\" is that systems\nhave the same ratio of dynamical mass to true enclosed total mass within their effective radii; i.e. dynamical mass is a\ngood proxy for true mass without a systematic dependence\non other galaxy properties. In other words, Mtrue = k Re \u03c3 2 /G\nwhere k \u2248 constant (Mtrue \u221d Re \u03c3 2 /G is expected on dimensional grounds; k is the integral argument which depends on\ne.g. the details of profile shape and kinematics). There are two\ngeneral possibilities:\n(a) Kinematic Non-Homology: In this case, the meaning\nof \u03c3 changes with mass, either because of different contributions of rotationally supported components, or because of\nvarying isotropy. Essentially all studies have found that this\neffect does not contribute to the FP tilt (see e.g. Gerhard et al.\n2001; Riciputi et al. 2005; Cappellari et al. 2007; Nipoti et al.\n2008, and references therein); specifically that there is no correlation between FP residuals and orbital anisotropy or rotation (within the elliptical population). Moreover, Ciotti et al.\n(1996) demonstrated that reproducing the observed tilt with\nsuch trends would require models with internally inconsistent\nor unphysical orbit structure.\n(b) Structural Non-Homology: Alternatively, the shape of\nthe light profile could change sufficiently, such that e.g. even\nif two systems were both spherical with isotropic velocity\ndispersion tensors, the integral term relating Mtrue and Mdyn\nis significantly different. (Note that this is not really independent of (a); the dominant effect of a change in the mass\nprofile shape is generally to change the central velocity dispersion, and correspondingly Mdyn , rather than dramatically\nchanging e.g. the physical meaning of Re , and differences in\nmass profile shape will generically require some kinematic\nnon-homology.) There has been debate regarding this possibility, as some observational studies (e.g. Prugniel & Simien\n1997; Trujillo et al. 2004) have argued that the observed dependence of galaxy Sersic index on mass is sufficient to drive\nthe tilt in the FP via structural non-homology. Others have\nnoted, however, that integral models which allow for multiple components or do not explicitly assume a constant M/L\nwith radius do not find such non-homology (e.g. Carollo et al.\n1995; Rix et al. 1997; Gerhard et al. 2001; Gerhard 2003;\nPadmanabhan et al. 2004; Cappellari et al. 2006). Moreover,\ninvoking structural non-homology can generally explain only\ndifferences in central velocity dispersion (the predicted FP\ntilt from such dynamical models disappears rapidly as \u03c3 is\nmeasured at somewhat larger fractions of Re ); the fact that\nthe FP tilt is not dramatically reduced using velocity dispersions measured in larger apertures (even out to Re ) rules out\nmost classes of such models (Bender et al. 1994; Ciotti et al.\n1996; Simien & Prugniel 1997, 2002; Emsellem et al. 2004;\nCappellari et al. 2006; Nipoti et al. 2008).\nOur analysis is able to explain both sides of this debate.\nFitting galaxy light profiles in a simplified manner, to a single\nSersic index, does appear to yield a significant dependence of\nSersic index on stellar mass, luminosity, or size. In Paper I,\nwe demonstrate that this is true of our simulations \u2013 i.e. when\nanalyzed in the same manner as the observations, they appear to yield an identical dependence of Sersic index on mass\n\n25\n\nto that found in Prugniel & Simien (1997) and Trujillo et al.\n(2004) (less massive systems, chosen in the same manner as\nthose here to have higher typical dissipational fractions, have\nlower fitted Sersic indices over the same observational dynamic range; see also Paper III) \u2013 even though (at fixed degree\nof dissipation), the systems are effectively homologous. Why,\nthen, does this occur?\nThe answer owes to the fact that a single Sersic index is not\na physically robust description of the light profile of an elliptical over its entire extent, and it also fails to include the dark\nmatter distribution. Such a fit mixes the outer dissipationless\ncomponent of the remnant with the inner, compact starburst\nremnant. All the observed samples which appear to find a dependence of Sersic index on mass, when re-analyzed based\non our physically motivated two-component decomposition,\nin fact reveal that the outer, dissipationless Sersic-like component is self-similar (see Paper II and Paper III); what changes\nwith mass or radius is the mass fraction in the central dissipational component. Furthermore, because of the true multicomponent nature of galaxy light profiles, fitting a single Sersic index yields different answers as a function of the dynamic\nrange employed: for fixed observing conditions, this yields\nan apparent correlation of Sersic index with galaxy mass or\nsize (see e.g. Padmanabhan et al. 2004; Boylan-Kolchin et al.\n2005). Because of the role of e.g. the mass fraction at large\nradii and subtle differences in the second derivatives of profile shape near Re in driving a fitted Sersic index, the observed dependence of Sersic index on mass reflects a complex\nmix of real differences in galaxy merger history (the fact that\nlow-mass systems have undergone more dissipational mergers, and that high-mass systems are increasingly likely to have\nundergone subsequent re-mergers, which will conserve the FP\nbut scatter some small stellar mass to larger radii, leading to\nlarger fitted Sersic indices) and observational differences in\ndynamic range, but little significant non-homology.\nWe have demonstrated here (\u00a7 5) and in Paper II that differences in the degree of dissipation (i.e. in the strength of\nthe central \"extra light\" component) \u2013 while capable of driving substantial differences in the fitted Sersic index when the\ngalaxy is fit to a single Sersic law \u2013 do not in fact drive traditional non-homology. They are not a large enough fraction\nof the total mass to dramatically alter the structural integrals.\nThis should not be surprising: the dependence of Mtrue /Mdyn\non Sersic index (in models where the mass distribution follows a pure Sersic law) is primarily driven by the behavior\nat large radii \u2013 large Sersic indices asymptotically approach\nthe power-law behavior I(r) \u221d r\u22122 , which implies a divergent\nmass at large r, and an implied effective radius Re \u2192 \u221e and\nrapidly increasing central velocity dispersion. This is precisely where observed profiles are in fact self-similar (in a\nmean sense; there is considerable variation object-to-object),\nwith at most a weak dependence on formation history (i.e.\nmedian difference \u2206ns \u223c 1 for those which have undergone\nmajor \"dry\" mergers; much less than is needed to explain the\nFP tilt), as we demonstrate in both observations and simulations in Paper II and Paper III.\nFurther, at these radii, the mass density is increasingly dark\nmatter-dominated: the structure integrals only depend significantly on the Sersic index ns if the dark matter profile is also\ndescribed by the same Sersic index \u2013 i.e. if the total M/L is a\nconstant function of radius, whereas essentially all kinematic\ndata at large radii indicates this is not the case (dark matter is\nrequired to explain the kinematics at large radii). As we have\n\n\f26\n\nHopkins et al.\n\nshown, and as demonstrated in observational kinematic modeling (e.g. Padmanabhan et al. 2004; Cappellari et al. 2006)\nand lensing studies (Bolton et al. 2007, 2008), the dark matter distribution is relatively insensitive to the details of the\nstellar mass distribution shape, and therefore the actual nonhomology driven by even large changes in the stellar ns is\nmuch less than would be calculated assuming the dark matter\nfollowed the same profile (if it were not so, the observed large\ndispersion in ns values would necessarily yield much larger\nscatter about the FP than is observed; see e.g. Bertin et al.\n2002).\nThe implication that a change in ns should lead to significant structural non-homology is therefore misleading: the observed dependence of ns on mass owes mainly to issues of\nfinite dynamic range and varying dissipational fractions, none\nof which give rise to significant structural non-homology.\nHowever, extrapolating to large radii based on these estimated\nns values and the incorrect assumptions (1) that a single Sersic\nlaw is a physically meaningful parameterization of the galaxy\nlight profile, and (2) that dark matter traces the stellar matter in a strict one-to-one fashion, implies (incorrectly) some\nstructural non-homology.\nMoreover, many studies indicate that dynamical mass is\nproportional to true enclosed mass (without requiring any\nhomology assumption); i.e. that there cannot be a large contribution to tilt from any form of traditional non-homology,\nwhether kinematic or structural. There are now independent lines of support for this conclusion: Cappellari et al.\n(2006) (see also van der Marel 1991; Kronawitter et al.\n2000; H\u00e4ring & Rix 2004) estimate true enclosed masses\nwithin Re based on two and three-integral modeling, from\ntwo-dimensional velocity maps of observed ellipticals.\nAlternatively, Bolton et al. (2007, 2008) measure strong\nlensing gravitational masses. In both cases, the authors find\nMtrue \u221d Mdyn , without any significant dependence on mass \u2013\nin other words, the FP is unchanged regardless of whether\nthe true total mass enclosed in Re is used, or whether the\ndynamical mass proxy Mdyn is used. It appears that at most,\nat the \u223c 3 \u03c3 limits on the observed Mtrue \u2212 Mdyn relation (and\nbased on the fitted Mtrue \u2212 M\u2217 relations in Figure 21), these\ntraditional forms of non-homology may contribute \u223c 1/4 the\nobserved tilt.\nGenuine Change in M/L: The observations therefore imply that the FP must reflect a genuine physical difference as\na function of mass: namely, that low-mass ellipticals have a\nhigher ratio of stellar or baryonic mass to total (baryonic plus\ndark matter) mass within the stellar Re , relative to high-mass\nellipticals. All means of achieving this end can be classified\ninto one of three categories:\n(a) Varying Global Baryon Fractions: One could imagine\nthat the stellar and halo mass distributions of different ellipticals are separately self-similar, but that the total ratio of stellar\nto halo mass changes as a function of galaxy mass. In other\nwords, there are no structural changes implied: one decreases\nthe halo mass relative to galaxy mass in lower-mass systems.\nWhile this may seem plausible at the highest galaxy masses\n(it is well established that in bright clusters, the total stellar\nto dark matter mass ratio decreases with mass), this is relevant over much larger scales than the stellar Re of the central\ngalaxy. Moreover, over most of the mass range of interest,\nthe known trends in global stellar to dark matter fractions are\nopposite to that needed to explain the FP tilt.\nAt masses below \u223c M\u2217 , where the FP is observed to be con-\n\ntinuous (recall, the observed FP and its tilt extend to systems\nwith masses < 10\u22122 M\u2217 ), all \u039bCDM models (e.g. Conroy et al.\n2006; Zentner et al. 2005; Zheng et al. 2005; Vale & Ostriker\n2006; Shankar et al. 2006; van den Bosch et al. 2007) and\nobservational constraints (Eke et al. 2004; Yang et al. 2005;\nMandelbaum et al. 2006; Weinmann et al. 2006; Wang et al.\n2006) require that the ratio of total dark matter halo mass to\nstellar mass is higher in lower-mass systems \u2013 i.e. that star\nformation is less efficient in low-mass systems. This is contrary to the effect desired here, and demonstrates that the FP\ntilt cannot owe to a simple global change in baryon fraction.\nIndirectly, however, the cosmological trend of stellar to dark\nmatter mass is in fact important \u2013 this lower star formation efficiency in low-mass systems means that they have larger gas\nfractions when they undergo mergers, which we show does\ngive rise to the FP tilt.\nIf the global baryonic mass ratio is unchanging at small\nradii (or changes in the opposite sense needed to tilt the FP),\nthen the only other possibility is that the size/shape of the halo\nand stellar distributions vary relative to one another: i.e. one\nof the two components is made more or less compact, relative\nto the other, altering the ratio of stellar to total mass within the\nstellar Re . Recall, the radii of interest are small relative to the\nhalo virial radii, and contain only a small fraction of the total\nhalo dark matter mass, so regardless of the total halo to stellar\nmass ratio, changing the compactness of one component relative to the other can make a significant difference. There two\npossibilities for this relative contraction/expansion:\n(b) Baryons are Fixed, Halos Contract: In this scenario,\nthe galaxy stellar mass distributions are \"scale free\" (i.e. do\nnot change owing to external factors), but the dark matter halos are less compact in low-mass ellipticals, so that within\nthe stellar Re (i.e. the central regions of the halo) the total\ndark matter mass fraction enclosed is lower. This is quickly\nruled out: all cosmological models (e.g. Navarro et al. 1996;\nBullock et al. 2001; Wechsler et al. 2002; Dolag et al. 2004;\nKuhlen et al. 2005; Neto et al. 2007) and observations from\ne.g. weak lensing and X-ray mass measurements (Buote et al.\n2007; Schmidt & Allen 2007; Comerford & Natarajan 2007)\nfind that halo concentration is a weak, decreasing function of\ngalaxy mass, the opposite of the effect desired.\nFurthermore, if this were the case, one would expect to\nsee it in progenitor disks, as well (the halos are insensitive\nto the morphological transformation of their central galaxies)\n\u2013 however, the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation and constraints\non the dark matter halos of disks (e.g. Persic & Salucci 1990;\nPersic et al. 1996b; Bell & de Jong 2001; McGaugh 2005,\nand references therein) reflect the expected cosmological\ntrends (namely, baryon fractions and halo sizes scaling as predicted in \u039bCDM, in a weaker and opposite sense from that\nnecessary if the FP tilt were to be explained in this manner). In\nshort, effects (a) and (b) would predict that disks should follow the same FP scalings as ellipticals (modulo possible normalization offsets) \u2013 while in fact, they obey different scalings\nwith, in many cases, an opposite qualitative sense (e.g. their\nsize-mass, velocity-mass, surface brightness-mass, and FP\nscalings; Faber & Jackson 1976; Kormendy 1989; Shen et al.\n2003).\nFigure 24 demonstrates this explicitly. We show the stellar\nsize-mass relation of ellipticals (from Figure 19), compared\nto that of disks (from Shen et al. (2003), but for our purposes\nhere different sources agree well).

Bottom: Same, but measuring Mdyn for the same observed ellipticals (from middle) at the mean expected\nradius of an equivalent (similar stellar mass) disk (from top). The best-fit relation to these data is shown; it is indistinguishable from the relation for disks.\nAt the radii of their equivalent disks, ellipticals and disks have the same enclosed total (dark matter plus stellar) masses. The distribution of dark matter\nis not significantly different \u2013 the smaller sizes and Mdyn of ellipticals must\nreflect a contraction of the baryonic material relative to the dark matter, as\npredicted to occur in dissipative mergers.\n\nnecessarily obey the same correlation if they were formed in\npurely dissipationless mergers (see also Ciotti & van Albada\n2001). Obviously, ellipticals at low mass (where we empirically estimate and theoretically expect dissipation to be important) are much more compact in their stellar distributions\nthan disks. We also compare the FP of both types of objects; i.e. dynamical mass Mdyn (measured within Re of the\nstellar light) versus stellar mass. We estimate the relation for\ndisks based on the data and best-fit relations in Bell & de Jong\n(2001) (see also Persic & Salucci 1990; Persic et al. 1996b,\nwho construct a similar correlation). Note that, for our purposes here, it makes little difference whether we plot the baryonic or stellar mass (there is almost no difference for ellipti-\n\n27\n\ncals, owing to their small gas content, and for disks, the relations fall within the quoted uncertainties in either case). It\nalso makes no significant difference whether we use the same\nvirial constant k to estimate Mdyn for both disks and ellipticals,\nor attempt to make some correction for either profile shapes or\nthe use of a velocity dispersion as opposed to a circular velocity (the difference is small, a factor . 2, and we are ultimately\ninterested in the qualitative scalings).\nIt is clear (in agreement with previous work) that the scaling\nof Mdyn /M\u2217 in disks is opposite that of ellipticals: there is\neither no tilt or inverse tilt in the FP (i.e. Mdyn /M\u2217 is the same\nor higher in low-mass disks). For ellipticals where we have\nkinematic data as a function of radius, we can test whether the\ndifference in the disk and elliptical scalings owes to effects\n(a) or (b); we do so by evaluating their enclosed mass Mdyn\nnot at the observed stellar effective radius of the spheroid, but\nat the radius of an equivalent disk (i.e. at the mean Re of a\ndisk of the same stellar mass). The resulting trend of Mdyn\nversus M\u2217 is indistinguishable from that of observed disks \u2013\ni.e. by considering elliptical properties at their equivalent disk\nradii (radii they would have in the absence of dissipation), we\neffectively remove the tilt of the FP, and recover the observed\ncorrelations of disks.\nAt the radius of a disk of similar mass (equivalently, at the\nradius the elliptical would have, if it were the product of a\npurely dissipationless merger of stellar disks), ellipticals have\nthe same enclosed total mass as equivalent disks. In other\nwords, at the same (equivalent dissipationless) radius, disks\nand ellipticals of the same mass have the same dark matter\nmass content and distribution. In general, it is observationally\nwell-established that the FP correlations of ellipticals become\nless distinct from those of disks as their properties are measured at larger radii. These correlations clearly rule out scenarios (a) and (b) above: if case (b) were true, disks and ellipticals should obey a similar stellar size-mass relation, and at\nthe Re of an equivalent disk, ellipticals should still have much\nlower Mdyn than spirals. If case (a) were true (i.e. both stellar and dark matter were more compact in ellipticals, but with\nlower total dark matter to stellar mass ratios), then we would\nagain expect much lower Mdyn at the equivalent disk radius in\nellipticals.\n(c) Halos are Fixed, Baryons Contract: The only remaining possibility is our conclusion in this paper: namely, that the\nFP tilt arises because lower-mass spheroids have more compact stellar mass distributions, relative to their halos (equivalently, relative to what their stellar mass distribution would\nbe in the absence of dissipation). We have demonstrated that\nthis outcome is a natural consequence of dissipation in mergers \u2013 regardless of the initial scalings obeyed by progenitor\ndisks, the fact that low mass disks are more gas-rich implies\nthat, on average, there will be more dissipation in their mergers, yielding more compact baryonic remnants (while having\nlittle effect on the halo), and therefore increasing the ratio\nof stellar to dark matter mass inside the stellar Re in lowermass systems. We further demonstrate that this reproduces\nprecisely the observed tilt and scalings of elliptical properties\nwith mass, while being consistent with all other observational\nconstraints on the FP, including the \"homology constraint,\"\nthat Mtrue \u221d Mdyn .\nWe have also shown that dissipation is necessary in achieving this. It has been known for some time that dissipationless mergers cannot alter the phase-space density of ellipticals relative to their disk progenitors; consequently, ellipticals produced through dissipationless mergers obey the same\n\n\f28\n\nHopkins et al.\n\nscaling relations as their spiral progenitors (modulo normalization offsets), in stark contrast to the observed FP scalings.\nWe demonstrate this explicitly: systems with the same dissipational fraction have the same ratio of total to stellar mass\nwithin Re ; i.e. do not internally exhibit any FP \"tilt.\" Furthermore, we show that dissipation is the dominant factor determining the effective radii of ellipticals at fixed mass, even\nallowing for differences in formation and merger history \u2013\ntherefore if the explanation for the FP invokes any systematic\nchange in elliptical sizes, it must involve dissipation. Only\nwhen the observed dependence of dissipation on mass is included is the observed tilt recovered.\n11.2. Additional Predictions\nWe have extensively considered the role of dissipation in\nsetting the FP tilt, effectively changing the ratio of Mdyn /M\u2217 .\nTo the extent that other properties also trace the degree of dissipation, we predict that these should similarly correlate with\nMdyn /M\u2217 . In Paper I and Paper II we develop an extensive set\nof predictions for elliptical properties that relate to the degree\nof dissipation in the spheroid-forming merger, and show how\nthese relate to, e.g., the observed extra light (i.e. the tracer\nof the degree of dissipation in the spheroid forming mergerinduced starburst). We refer to those papers for details and a\nlarge number of observational proxies of the degree of dissipation which can be used to further test the ideas herein.\nTo the extent that the degree of dissipation in the original\nspheroid-forming merger reflects the gas fractions of the progenitor disks, it must also reflect the progenitor star formation history. Broadly speaking, disks with more extended star\nformation histories would be expected to have larger gas fractions at the time of their merger, with younger stellar population ages and lower \u03b1-enhancement. If we ignore the effect of\nthe merger on these stellar populations (a reasonable assumption if the system is observed at times significantly later than\nthe merger, and if the mass fraction formed in the mergerinduced starburst is not large, which are true for most of the\nobserved systems of interest here), then these should be reflected in the stellar populations of the elliptical remnant. Preliminary observational comparisons from Graves et al. (2008)\nappear to support these predictions, and can provide powerful\nindependent tests and constraints for models of dissipation in\nspheroid formation: we therefore outline some relevant quantitative predictions.\nConsider the following highly simplified toy model: identical progenitor disks with initial gas fraction fgas = 1 follow an exponential, closed-box star formation history with\ntime scale \u03c4 , i.e. \u1e40\u2217 \u221d exp (\u2212t/\u03c4 ), and merge at time tm ,\nwhen the remaining gas is rapidly consumed in a central starburst. The gas fraction at the time of the merger (and correspondingly, the dissipational fraction in the starburst) will\nbe fsb = exp (\u2212tm /\u03c4 ) (giving \u03c4 = tm / ln (1/ fsb )), and the massweighted mean formation time of the stars will be tform =\n\u03c4 [1 \u2212 exp(\u2212tm /\u03c4 )] = tm (1 \u2212 fsb )/ ln (1/ fsb ). For systems with\na similar redshift range of their last major merger (similar tm ,\nexpected for systems of similar mass), their stellar formation\ntimes should therefore correlate with the starburst fraction fsb\n(both depending implicitly on the pre-merger star formation\ntimescale \u03c4 ).\nWe have shown in \u00a7 6 how Mdyn /M\u2217 is predicted to scale\nwith the dissipational fraction fsb (this can be roughly approximated as Mdyn /M\u2217 \u223c ( fsb /0.2)\u22121/2 over the range of interest); combining the two, this yields an expected correla-\n\ntion between formation time and x \u2261 Mdyn /M\u2217 of the form\ntform = 0.5tm (1 \u2212 0.2 x\u22122 )/ ln (2.24 x). Observed at z = 0 (i.e.\nwith age tH \u2212tform ), ellipticals with larger x = Mdyn /M\u2217 at fixed\nmass (similar tm ) should be older \u2013 for a typical tm \u223c 10 Gyr,\nsystems with Mdyn /M\u2217 \u2248 2 are predicted to be \u223c 2 Gyr older\nthan systems with Mdyn /M\u2217 \u2248 1.\nA shorter star formation history also implies higher \u03b1enrichment in the progenitors. If we adopt the correlation\nfor simple star formation models in Thomas et al. (2005),\n[\u03b1/Fe] \u2248 1/5 \u2212 1/6 log \u2206t (where \u2206t is the star formation\ntimescale for a Gaussian burst, but for our purposes here can\nbe replaced by \u03c4 modulo a conversion constant), and the scalings above, then we obtain the result (independent of the\nmerger time tm ) that ellipticals with higher Mdyn /M\u2217 should\nbe more \u03b1-enriched. Specifically, objects with Mdyn /M\u2217 \u2248 2\nare predicted to have [\u03b1/Fe] values \u2248 0.04 \u2212 0.05 higher than\nsystems with Mdyn /M\u2217 \u2248 1.\nPredictions for the absolute metallicities are more ambiguous (but see Paper II). In general, the trend of total/mean\nmetallicity with mass will be dominated by the metallicity of pre-merger disks, which observations show (excluding\nthe most gas-rich disks, where self-enrichment in the merger\nwill dominate the final total metallicity) trace a similar massmetallicity correlation to ellipticals (Gallazzi et al. 2005). In\nthe absence of outflows or recycling, the metallicity would be\nthe same for any systems with the same total accreted gas content and stellar mass (with no dependence on the \"starburst\"\ncontent at fixed mass). However, to the extent that outflows\nin low-mass systems are responsible for the mass-metallicity\nrelation (as is generally believed), then the detailed interplay\nbetween these outflows and merger-induced starbursts will be\nimportant. In broad terms, if outflow strengths and velocities\nare similar, then we expect dissipational star formation at the\ncenter of the galaxy to retain a higher metal content in comparison to the same star formation in a more extended disk\n(since escape velocities from the galactic center and densities leading to radiative losses in the outflows are higher). In\nthis case, at fixed mass, more dissipational (lower Mdyn /M\u2217 ,\nhigher surface brightness) systems should have slightly higher\nmetallicities than their less dissipational counterparts (and, as\ndemonstrated in Paper I, this should be correlated with the effects above \u2013 at fixed mass, the dependence of both quantities\non dissipation should give rise to an inverse correlation between metallicity and stellar population age or \u03b1-enrichment).\nExperimenting with e.g. different degrees of dissipation, outflow strengths, and initial disk metalliticies in our simulations, we estimate this to be a relatively small (\u223c 0.1 dex)\neffect \u2013 not sufficient to dramatically effect the global massmetallicity relation, but potentially visible in detailed studies.\nThere is one important caveat here: systems of the same\nmass might also have had more gas-rich progenitors because\nthey formed from mergers at very early times (i.e. had a different merger time tm , in the toy model illustrated above), making\nthem older and more \u03b1-enriched. However, cosmological estimates (e.g. Hopkins et al. 2008b) suggest this process is not\ndominant at a given stellar mass \u2013 i.e. systems of comparable\nstellar mass (and correspondingly similar total halo masses)\ntend to have similar merger histories. Specifically, the relatively large scatter in star formation history and disk gas fractions at fixed mass and redshift (a factor \u223c 2 in fgas ) is larger\nthan the scatter introduced by the combination of a scatter in\nformation times and the systematic cosmological evolution of\ndisk gas fractions with time. Furthermore, systems with such\n\n\fDissipation and the FP\nearly mergers will usually have multiple subsequent mergers\nat later times, so they will grow significantly in mass and have\ntheir effective radii substantially modified by these additional\nprocesses (such that they should and will be compared to different systems at z = 0).\nConsidering higher order effects, we demonstrate in Paper\nII that the strength of stellar population gradients is correlated\nwith the degree of dissipation in the original spheroid-forming\ngas-rich merger, and show in Paper III that this holds even\nfor remnants of subsequent gas-poor \"dry\" re-mergers. The\nmost useful gradients in this sense are metallicity gradients\n\u2013 stellar age gradients and (especially) color gradients evolve\nstrongly with time even in a fixed, passively evolving elliptical (owing to the change in relative M/L for young and old\nstellar populations) and as such are more ambiguous, and gradients in \u03b1-enhancement are more sensitive to the gradients\nand overall star formation histories in the pre-merger disks.\nMetallicity gradients are, on the other hand, generally dominated by the degree of dissipation and imprinted in the gasrich merger, and are not sensitive to the star formation history\nof the pre-merger disks, making them a more robust diagnostic for our purposes. At fixed mass, stronger gradients indicate\nmore dissipation, and so we predict that, at fixed mass, ellipticals with higher Mdyn /M\u2217 should have weaker metallicity\ngradients (see Paper II).\n11.3. Summary\n\nWe have demonstrated from observations that the tilt of the\nFP owes to differential degrees of dissipation as a function of\nmass. Lower mass disks are more gas-rich, so their mergers\nare more dissipational: a larger fraction of the remnant mass\nis formed in a dissipational, merger-induced compact central\nstarburst in the final stages of a major merger. This yields\na remnant with a more compact stellar mass distribution, i.e.\nsmaller Re relative to their progenitor disks, in lower-mass ellipticals. The dark matter distribution is only weakly affected\n\u2013 implying that the stellar distribution in low-mass ellipticals\nis more compact, relative to the dark matter, than in equivalent disks or higher-mass ellipticals. Consequently, relatively\nless dark matter mass is enclosed within the stellar effective\nradius in low-mass ellipticals, so the ratio of enclosed mass\nMdyn /M\u2217 is an increasing function of mass (Mdyn /M\u2217 \u221d M\u2217\u03b1 ).\nThis is the \"tilt\" in the FP. Given the observed, quantitative\ndependence of gas fractions on mass, the tilt is predicted to be\nexactly that observed, \u03b1 \u2248 0.2.\nUsing a new empirical method, we robustly estimate the\namount of dissipation involved in the formation a given elliptical. Specifically, with data of sufficient quality, we separate\nthe observed surface brightness profile into an outer, violently\nrelaxed component, which was established in a dissipationless manner, and an inner \"starburst remnant\" or \"extra light\"\ncomponent. We demonstrate in Paper I, Paper II and Paper III\nthat observations of both evolved ellipticals and recent merger\nremnants support the proposal that this compact nuclear mass\ncomponent a good proxy for the true mass formed in a dissipational starburst. Using this proxy, we show that the observed sizes of ellipticals, at fixed mass, depend strongly on\nthe degree of dissipation involved in their formation (more\nso than even e.g. the number of mergers in their formation\nhistory). Correspondingly, we show that the ratio of total\nto stellar mass within the stellar effective radius, Mdyn /M\u2217 ,\nis a function of dissipation, both globally and at fixed mass\n(in the sense that elliptical sizes and Mdyn /M\u2217 are decreasing\nfunctions of the amount of dissipation). These observed de-\n\n29\n\npendences are highly significant (Pnull . 10\u22127 ). Motivated by\nthis, we show that by removing the mean systematic dependence of dissipation on mass, we can empirically remove the\ntilt of the FP. Considering ellipticals with the same dissipational extra light fractions, we show that they obey a relation\nMdyn \u221d M\u2217 (i.e. ellipticals with the same extra light content\nhave the same ratio of dynamical to stellar mass within Re ,\nindependent of mass).\nIn the proposed dissipational models of the FP (Bekki 1998;\nO\u00f1orbe et al. 2005; Robertson et al. 2006b; Dekel & Cox\n2006), the tilt of the FP, and its projected correlations (e.g. the\nsteepness of the stellar size-mass correlation of ellipticals relative to that of disks), arise because low-mass disks are more\ngas-rich, and therefore low-mass mergers and ellipticals will\nhave (on average) systematically higher degrees of dissipation, and therefore smaller (relative) Re and Mdyn /M\u2217 . If we\nconsider e.g. simulations that obey the observed correlation\nbetween disk gas content and mass (as opposed to being dissipationless, or having all the same gas fractions independent\nof mass \u2013 neither of which is consistent with observations),\nthen the FP predicted has exactly the observed tilt. Equivalently, the observed mean dissipational fractions of ellipticals,\nas a function of mass, agree well with the observed gas fractions of progenitor disks of the same masses, over the redshift\nrange z \u223c 0 \u2212 2. In other words, dissipation is both necessary\nand sufficient to explain the FP tilt and differences between\ndisk and elliptical scaling relations.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first explicit observational\ntest of these theoretical models. We further demonstrate that\nother mechanisms cannot be responsible for the majority of\nthe FP tilt. For example, observations have demonstrated\nthat the \"homology assumption,\" namely that Mtrue \u221d \u03c3 2 Re ,\nis valid, and we show that simulations predict this \u2013 the homology breaking introduced by dissipation is negligible. In\nother words, the FP tilt reflects the ratio of stellar to true mass\nenclosed within Re : Mtrue /M\u2217 \u221d M\u2217\u03b1 (this ratio is not constant), rather than an \"apparent\" effect. We also show that,\nif we measure elliptical properties at the radius of an equivalent disk, the tilt of the FP is removed: within the radii of\ndisks of the same mass, ellipticals have the same total and dynamical masses. That is, the dependence of Mdyn /M\u2217 cannot\nbe driven primarily by changes in the dark matter distribution\nat fixed baryonic properties, nor by changes in the total dark\nmatter to stellar mass ratio (integrated over the entire halo).\nThe variation in Mdyn /M\u2217 within Re must predominantly reflect the change in size of the baryonic component: low-mass\nellipticals have much more compact stellar distributions than\nsimilar-mass disks, and therefore have less enclosed dark matter within that stellar Re , as predicted in dissipational theories.\nTogether, these observational tests represent an important\nvindication of the \"merger hypothesis,\" that ellipticals are\nformed by the gas-rich mergers of disk galaxies, and models for the origin of the FP in dissipational major mergers (Robertson et al. 2006b; Dekel & Cox 2006). We explicitly demonstrate that, regardless of subsequent gas-poor\n(spheroid-spheroid or \"dry\") re-mergers, the location of systems with respect to the FP and e.g. elliptical size-mass and\nvelocity dispersion-mass relations is primarily determined by\nthe amount of dissipation involved in their formation: i.e. the\ngas content involved in the original, spheroid-forming merger.\nGas rich mergers cannot be ignored in the formation of ellipticals. Not only have we demonstrated that the FP is consistent\nwith the merger hypothesis, but that (given the systematic de-\n\n\f30\n\nHopkins et al.\n\npendence of disk gas fractions on mass), a FP tilted in the\nmanner observed is a necessary prediction of the theory.\nWe have also shown that elliptical sizes, inferred dissipational fractions, and the FP are completely consistent with\nthe formation of ellipticals in mergers of disks with similar\nproperties (sizes, gas fractions, dark matter halo masses and\nsizes) to those observed in low-redshift (z \u223c 0 \u2212 1) disks. In\nother words, the sizes of ellipticals and their FP correlations\ndo not require elliptical progenitors to be more compact than\nobserved, low-redshift disks. Dissipation is sufficient to explain the differences in their densities and sizes. The fact\nthat, within the radius of an equivalent disk, ellipticals obey\nthe same correlation between total and stellar mass actually\nimplies that their dark matter halos (and presumably those\nof their progenitors) are not significantly more compact than\nthose of low-redshift disks.\nThis is important for the viability of the merger hypothesis,\ngiven the observations indicating that disk and halo sizes do\nnot evolve strongly with redshift (Ravindranath et al. 2004;\nBarden et al. 2005; Trujillo et al. 2006; Zirm et al. 2007).\nThis is not to say that elliptical sizes might not evolve with\nredshift (which is easily possible if e.g. disk gas fractions sys-\n\ntematically evolve; see Khochfar & Silk 2006; Hopkins et al.\n2007a), nor that ellipticals all formed at low redshift (indeed,\nif the disk size evolution is weak, then ellipticals form could\nrapidly at relatively early times and still resemble the products\nof low-redshift disks). However, it does imply that exotic progenitors \u2013 progenitors not found in the local universe \u2013 are not\nrequired to explain the observed correlations, surface brightness profiles (see Paper II and Paper III), or kinematics (see\nCox et al. 2006b) of typical local ellipticals.\n\nWe thank John Kormendy, Tod Lauer, and Barry Rothberg\nfor providing observations and suggestions for the content\nherein, and thank Brant Robertson, Marijn Franx and Sandy\nFaber for helpful discussions throughout the development of\nthis paper.
