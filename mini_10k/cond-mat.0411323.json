It was originally formulated for explanation of the resistivity minimum in metallic alloys [1] due to the scattering of conduction electrons by a magnetic impurity, and later generalized to various cases. The Kondo effect turns out\nto be a key phenomenon of the heavy fermion behavior\n[2], anomalous electronic properties of metallic glasses at\nlow temperatures [3], quantum dots [4], and many other\ncorrelated electron problems. One of the main results of\nthis theory is the formation of a resonance with small\nenergy scale (so-called, the Kondo temperature TK ) near\nthe Fermi energy due to the scattering of conduction electrons by local quantum systems with internal degrees of\nfreedom. Originally this resonance (usually called the\nKondo, or Abrikosov-Suhl resonance; for a review, see\nRef. 2) could be experimentally investigated only indirectly, through the temperature dependence of thermodynamic and transport properties of metals. However,\nnovel tunneling spectroscopy, in particular scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), is now able to directly visualize\nthe Kondo resonance [5, 6, 7]. At the same time, theoretical investigation of the spectral density for Kondo\nsystems is a much more complicated problem than the\ncalculation of thermodynamic properties. Indeed, in the\nlatter case exact analytical results can be derived by the\nBethe Ansatz [8], whereas the electron density of states\nis considered mainly by some approximate methods or\nnumerically, see, e.g., Refs. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.\nThe splitting of the Kondo resonance by external magnetic field was investigated by Bethe Ansatz for the s-d\nexchange model [17]. These results can be used to verify\ndifferent approximate schemes demonstrating some difficulties, for example, with the well-known non-crossing\napproximation (NCA) [10].\nGenerally speaking, we have now a complete and satisfactory theory of the Kondo resonance for the prototype\ncase of purely spin scattering. On the other hand, the\ninformation about the systems with orbital degrees of\n\nfreedom is still insufficient. A so-called \"orbital Kondo\nresonance\" has been considered theoretically, for atomic\ntwo-level systems in metallic glasses, for quadrupolar degrees of freedom in some uranium-based compounds [3],\nfor high-temperature superconductors [18], and for double quantum dot systems [19]. Recently the phase diagram of the Anderson model with orbital degrees of\nfreedom has been investigated by the numerical renormalization group (NRG) method [20]. Spin (pseudospin)\nsusceptibility for the double quantum dot model has been\ninvestigated by this technique in Ref. 19. However, electron spectral density has not been calculated. It is worthwhile to note that investigation of dynamical properties\nfor effective impurity models is of the crucial importance\nfor the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) approach,\nin particular, to describe the metal-insulator transition\nand related phenomena [21]. For one-band case the NRG\nmethod was applied to DMFT problem in Ref. 22.\nDirect observation of the orbital Kondo resonance on\nCr(001) surface by the STM measurements [7], as well as\na relevance for multiple quantum dot systems [19], makes\nthe issue about the shape of the Kondo resonance and\nabout effects of \"pseudomagnetic\" field which breaks the\norbital degeneracy especially actual. Here we investigate\nthe problem of orbital Kondo resonance by the NRG approach [23]. We shall demonstrate that in the \"orbital\"\nKondo case the resonance has an essential asymmetry\nwith respect to the Fermi energy, in qualitative agreement with the experimental observations [7].\nWe start from the two-band Anderson impurity model\nwith the spin and orbital rotationally invariant Hamiltonian [24]\n\nH=\n\n\u0011i\n\u0010\nXh \u2020\n\u2020\n\u03b5k cka\u03c3 cka\u03c3 + V fa\u03c3\ncka\u03c3 + c\u2020ka\u03c3 fa\u03c3 + Himp\nka\u03c3\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\n\n\u03b5f \u2212\n\nh\u03c3 \u0011\n\n\u2020\nfa\u03c3\nfa\u03c3 +\n\n2\na\u03c3\nX \u0012U\nU \u2212J\nna\u03c3 nb\u2212\u03c3 +\nna\u03c3 nb\u03c3\n2\n2\n\na6=b,\u03c3\n\nU +J X\nna\u03c3 na\u2212\u03c3 +\n2\na\u03c3\n\u0013\nJ \u2020\n\u2020\n\u2212 fa\u03c3 fa\u2212\u03c3 fb\u2212\u03c3 fb\u03c3\n2\n\nHere a, b = 1,2 and \u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193 are orbital and spin indices,\ncorrespondingly, c\u2020ka\u03c3 (cka\u03c3 ) denote the creation (annihilation) operators for a-orbital states with spin \u03c3 and\nenergy \u03b5k (we take the rectangle band with half width\n\u2020\nD = 2), fa\u03c3\n(fa\u03c3 ) those for impurity states of a-orbital\n\u2020\nwith spin \u03c3 and energy \u03b5f , na\u03c3 = fa\u03c3\nfa\u03c3 , h is magnetic\nfield. Since the spin and orbital degrees of freedom are\nsymmetric in the Hamiltonian, h may be a pseudomagnetic field (e.g., for the orbital Kondo effect on Cr(001)\nsurface where the potential of the atomic step edge breaks\nthe exact degeneracy between dxz and dyz states [7]).\nThe Coulomb interaction and exchange parameter at the\nimpurity site are U and J, and two electron subsystems\nare coupled via a hybridization parameter V . Note that\nin solids the orbital moment conservation is not an exact property and therefore some additional terms in the\nHamiltonian may appear [25]. However, we omit them\nsince the problem turns out to be numerically very cumbersome even for the rotationally invariant Hamiltonian.\nTo calculate the spectral properties of impurity we use\nthe NRG technique which is described in details in Refs.\n2, 11, 23, 26. Here we emphasize the new aspects for\nmulti-orbital Anderson model.\nAs usually, we start from the solution of the isolated\nimpurity problem. As an initial step of the RG procedure, we add the first conduction electron site, diagonalize the Hamiltonian matrix for this Hilbert space,\nand thus obtain new eigenstates. Then such a procedure\nshould be repeated until reaching a fixed point. Dimension of the Hilbert space within one NRG-iteration increases by factor 16 instead of 4 for the one-band case. By\nusing an appropriate symmetry of the problem we were\nable to find the whole spectrum for the Hilbert space\nwith the dimensionality of 48000 states, which gives a\npossibility to keep at each step about 3000 states [27].\nDue to the NRG discretization scheme, the electron\nspectral function\n1\n\u03c1f (\u03c9) = \u2212 ImG(\u03c9 + i0) ,\n\u03c0\n\n\u2020\nG(z) = hhfa\u03c3 |fa\u03c3\niiz\n\nis given by a set of \u03b4-functional peaks at the frequencies \u03c9n . Standard NRG practice consists of the Gaussian\nbroadening of the spectral function on a logarithmic scale\n[11]. Since the point \u03c9 = 0 plays special role in such a\nscheme, we used more conventional Gaussian broadening\n\n\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9n ) \u2192\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\n(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9n )2\n1\n\u221a exp \u2212\n,\nbL \u03c0\nb2L\n\n(2)\n\nsmearing being changed depending on the iteration number L, namely, bL+2 = bL /\u039b (where the NRG cutoff parameter \u039b = 2 have been used).\n10.2\n\n1.0\n\nn\n\nf\n\n10.0\n\nf\n\nHimp =\n\nX\u0010\n\nr (w)\n\nwhere\n\nas\n\n0.5\n\n0.8\n\n9.8\n\n0.6\n\n9.6\n\n0.4\n\n9.4\n\n0.2\n\n9.2\n\n0.0\n0.000\n\nr (w)\n\nE\n\nf\n\nF\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.003\n\n0.2\n-0.10\n\n0.006\n\n-0.05\n\nh\n\n9.0\n\n0.00\n\n0.05\n\nw\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\nw\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFIG. 1: The density of states for the half-filled case, \u03b5f =\n\u22123, V = 0.2, U = 2, J = 0, h = 0 (solid) and symmetric splitting (only the spin-up DOS) in the magnetic field h = 0.006\n(dot), h = 0.01 (dash) and h = 0.02 (dash-dot). Occupation\nnumber per orbital and spin are shown in the left insert (total\nnf = 2). Density of states at the Fermi level according to the\nFriedel sum rule (3) is \u03c1f (0) = 10.13. Right insert shows the\nDOS in the vicinity of the Fermi level.\n\nThe Kondo regime corresponds to the case where\n|\u03b5f | & 2\u0393 [12], \u0393 = \u03c0V 2 \u03c1 being the one-particle resonance width for the localized electrons, \u03c1 is the bare DOS\nof conduction electrons at EF . The density of states for\nthe half-filled case (nf = 2) and for almost quarter-filled\ncase (nf \u2248 1) are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively.\nAlthough the Hund interaction J was estimated to have\nconsiderable value [7], this quantity is irrelevant for the\nquarter-filled case; our RG calculations confirmed that\nJ does not influence essentially the results (see insert in\nFig. 2). The main difference of the NRG results obtained\nhere with those for the nondegenerate Anderson model is\nthat the Kondo peak is not centered at the Fermi energy\nEF = 0. An explanation of this deviation is given by the\nFriedel sum rule for the phase shifts \u03b7l : 2(2l+1)\u03b7l /\u03c0 = nf\n[28], 2l + 1 being the number of orbital channels and nf\nthe total number of localized electrons. It is important\nthat due to locality of the self-energy the value of \u03c1f (0)\ndoes not change in comparison with the non-interacting\nmodel (U = 0) and is equal to\n\u0010 \u03c0n \u0011\n1\nf\n\u03c1f (0) =\n,\n(3)\nsin2\n\u03c0\u0393\nN\n\nwhere N is the degeneracy factor [29]. For the standard\nSU (2) Kondo model for S = 1/2, as well as for a degenerate half-filled model, the phase shift at EF is close to\n\u03c0/2 which means the strongest possible scattering at the\n\n\f3\ntop of the resonance peak. In this case the asymmetry\nof the Kondo resonance with respect to EF should be\nvery weak even for the nonsymmetric Anderson model,\nin agreement with recent computational results [16], and\nwith our Fig. 1. Thus the large value of electronic effective mass and linear specific heat is owing to renormalization of the residue of the electron Green's function,\n\nZ=\n\n\u2202Re\u03a3(E)\n1\u2212\n\u2202E\n\nE=EF\n\n!\u22121\n\n(4)\n\nOn the other hand, for N > 2 and nf \u2248 1 the top of the\nf-electron peak shifts above EF [2]. In particular, in the\nSU (N ) Anderson model (or in the equivalent CoqublinSchrieffer model) with infinitely large N [9, 10] the high\npeak lies completely above the Fermi level, being shifted\nby the value of the order of TK (note that in the limit\nN \u2192 \u221e this is just a delta-like peak). NRG calculations for SU (N ) Anderson model [11] give qualitatively\nsimilar results. However, the values of \u03c1f (0) calculated\nin Ref. [11] turn out to be by about 30% smaller than\ngiven by Eq.(3), probably, due to insufficient accuracy.\nOur results for double-degenerate model give \u03c1f (0) in the\nperfect agreement with the Friedel sum rule (see captions\nto Fig. 1).\n3\n\nare several qualitatively different regimes of magnetic\nsplitting in the double-degenerate Anderson model:\n(i) a half-filled case where nf = 2 due to electronhole symmetry even in the presence of external magnetic\nfield. The usual symmetrical splitting takes place, the\nKondo peaks becomes low and broad (Fig. 1), similar to\nthe behavior in the non-degenerate symmetric Anderson\nmodel [16].\n(ii) a nearly quarter-filled case: nf \u2248 1. The splitting of the Kondo peak is asymmetric. One can see from\nFig. 3 that the upper \"spin down\" peak becomes low\nand broad, as well as in the symmetric case. At the same\ntime, the lower \"spin up\" peak is not suppressed (as in\nthe standard Kondo model), but tends to the Fermi level\nand becomes more high (however, the situation changes\nwith decreasing V : the height and area of spin-up peak\ndecreases considerably in strong magnetic field). The\ndensity of states at EF remains high up to very strong\nfields, so that the partial f-occupation numbers depend\nstrongly on h. For very strong fields the peak corresponding to spin down states is completely suppressed\n(nf a\u2193 \u2192 0), and only orbital Kondo resonance between\nspin up states survives since nf a\u2191 \u2192 1/2, in contrast with\nthe case (i) where nf a\u2191 \u2192 1.\n(iii) the intermediate valence regime (nf is essentially\nnon-integer). Instead of the three-peak structure characteristic for the Kondo regime, we have one peak which is\nsplit in magnetic field (Fig. 4).\n\nE\n\n2.5\n\nF\n3.5\n\nE\n\nF\n\n2.0\n\nh\n\nspin-\n\n3.0\n\n2\n\nr (w)\n\n1.5\n\n0.5\n\nn\n\nr (w)\n\na\n\nf s\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n1.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.8\n\n0.1\n\n2.5\n\n0.4\n\nw\n\n1\n\n0.00\n\nh\n\n0.01\n\n0.0\n\n0.00\n\n2.0\n\nw\n\n0.05\n\nf\n\nr (w)\n\nf\n\n0.0\n\n0.000 0.004 0.008\n\nf\n\n1.6\n\ni\n\nspin-\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0.000\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\nw\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFIG. 2: The density of states for the almost quarter-filled\ncase for \u03b5f = \u22121, U = 2, J = 0, V = 0.35.
