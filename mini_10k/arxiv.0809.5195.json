The active amplification of the living cochlea was\nconjectured by Gold in 1948 [5] and is now qualitatively studied widely through the Hopf equation in mathematical\nmodels [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. In order to give a better understanding to the experimental observations, a more accurate\nmodel is required. Furthermore the physical origin of the active oscillation remains still unclear. In mammals, the\nouter hair cells (OHCs) are known to be force generators for auditory sensitivity and frequency selectivity. Proposed\nmechanisms of the force generation are contraction of the OHC itself [11, 12, 13] and an active motion of the hair\nbundle [14, 15].\nEnergy depot model can describe the active phenomena [16, 17], because the energy supplied by the depot can\ninduce a negative dissipation. A similar mechanism for a negative stiffness in the bullfrog's hair bundle has been\nreported [18]. It is reasonable to consider the OHC as an energy depot since the OHCs play an important role in\nthe active amplification of the cochlea even though we do not know the exact mechanism of the energy supply. In\nnature all living things have some mechanisms of protection for survival. We expect that there might be a similar\nmechanism to protect cochlea from damage by any external factors such as loud stimulation. Hence, we propose a\nbraking mechanism in the cochlea to prevent the basilar membrane (BM) from an excessive oscillation which could\ndamage the cochlea. For this purpose, a critical velocity of the OHC oscillation will be introduced in our model.\nIn the following sections, we describe our model and reproduce the essential phenomena of the active cochlea\nobserved in recent experiments such as the compressive nonlinearity, the dynamics of the BM response, nonlinear\ndistortion and the spontaneous BM oscillation (SBMO). It will also be pointed ut that our model naturally includes\nthe Hopf bifurcation model [6, 9] in the case of weak stimulation. However, in the regime of strong stimulation, the\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress:\naddress:\n\u2021 Electronic address:\n\u00a7 Electronic address:\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nxyzhang@phya.yonsei.ac.kr\nckkim@yonsei.ac.kr\nkjblee@ewha.ac.kr\nyoungah@mju.ac.kr\n\n\f2\npresent model is essentially different from the Hopf bifurcation model.\n\nCF = 10 kHz\n4\n\n10\n\nStimulation frequency = 10 kHz\nStimulation frequency = 12 kHz\nStimulation frequency = 15 kHz\nStimulation frequency = 19 kHz\n3\n\nVelocity of the BM (\u03bc m/s)\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n\u22122 \u22121\n\n\u03bc = 600 kg m s\n\n1\n\n10\n\nd2/c = 6 \u00d7 105\nqd2/c = \u03bc\n0\n\n10\n\nv = 0.001 ms\u22121\nc\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\n120\n\nSound Pressure Level (dB)\nFIG. 1: The compressive response of the BM. The CF is 10kHz. It shows that the response of the BM is non-linear and\ncompressive at the CF. (Note that the slope of the solid line is less than one.) Otherwise, the response of the BM is a linear\nfunction of the stimulation yielding that the slopes are 1. These results agree with the experimental observations [24].\n\nII.\n\nENERGY DEPOT MODEL WITH BRAKING MECHANISM\n\nIt is well known that a change of transmembrane potential in the OHC induces a somatic vibration. This implies\nthat a part of the electric energy is converted into the mechanical energy. In this sense, we believe that the OHC\nfunctions as an energy depot for the BM. The OHC as the energy depot stores energy supplied and converts it into\nkinetic energy overcoming dissipation. This energetics can be described by the following energy balance equation [16].\ndE(t)\n= q \u2212 cE(t) \u2212 d(v)E(t),\ndt\n\n(1)\n\nwhere E(t) is the energy density of the energy depot, q the rate of the energy pumping into the energy depot per\nunit area, c the rate of the internal energy dissipation, d(v) the rate of the energy converting into the kinetic energy\n\n\f3\nof the BM, and v the velocity of the BM. Considering that constant contribution of d(v) can be incooperated into\nc and that conversion rate of the energy into the kinetic energy of the BM will not be sensitive to the sign of v, we\nassume that d(v) is an even function of v without a constant term. The energy depot model in which d(v) = d2 v 2\nhas been extensively discussed [16]. In this paper, we include the next higher contribution to d(v) and introduce a\ncritical velocity of the BM to describe a braking mechanism [17]. Hence the conversion rate d(v) can be written as\n\u0012\n\u0013\nv2\n2\nd(v) = d2 v 1 \u2212 2 ,\n(2)\nvc\nwhere vc is the critical velocity. For a finite vc the oscillation of the BM can be braked by the negative conversion\nrate into the kinetic motion of the BM. Note that vc \u2192 \u221e corresponds to a system without the braking mechanism.\nThe critical velocity will be roughly estimated from the contraction of the OHC later for our numerical calculation.\n\n1500\nv = 0.001 m/s\nc\n\n1000\n500\n\nVelocity of the BM (\u03bc m/s)\n\n0\n\u2212500\n\u22121000\n\u22121500\n\n0\n\n0.002\n\n0.004\n\n0.006\n\n0.008\n\n0.01\n\n0.012\n\n4000\n\nvc = \u221e\n2000\n\n0\n\n\u22122000\n\n\u22124000\n\n0\n\n0.002\n\n0.004\n\n0.006\n\n0.008\n\n0.01\n\n0.012\n\nTime (s)\nFIG. 2: The dynamic response of the BM when the CF is 10kHz and the stimulation is 100dB.

The stimulation is unloaded at t = 9ms. The\nlower panel shows the response represents the case without the braking mechanism, showing a continuous increase as long as\nthe stimulation is on.\n\nNow it is worthwhile to compare our newly proposed model with the one previously introduced in Ref.

The velocity of the BM is (not) saturated when the stimulation is sufficiently large with (without) the\nbraking mechanism.\n\npropagating hydrodynamic wave is considered. The model in Ref. [10] describes the coupling of the active elements\nto the propagating wave, while the present model describes the coupling between the energy depot(OHC) and the\nBM oscillation. The emphasis in this paper is on showing that the active and compressive response arises naturally\nfrom the generalized energy depot concept.\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nAn adiabatic approximation in which the adaptation of the energy depot is very fast [16] yields that\nE(t) =\n\nq\n.\nc + d2 (1 \u2212 v 2 /vc2 ) v 2\n\n(3)\n\n\f5\nIt should bear in mind that E(t) is not constant. The oscillation of the BM is then governed by\n\u03c1v\u0307 + \u03bcv + \u03baR = Fpassive + Factive ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the density, \u03bc the physical damping coefficient, \u03ba the stiffness, and R the displacement of the BM. Fpassive\nincludes the contributions of a sound wave (external stimulation) and a noise. The noise is assumed to be a Gaussian\nwhite noise. Factive is the active force density acting on the BM by the OHC,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nv2\nd2\n1\u2212 2 v\nq\nd(v)E(t)\nc\nvc\n\u0012\n\u0013 .\n(5)\n=\nFactive =\nv\nv2\nd2\n1 \u2212 2 v2\n1+\nc\nvc\nNote that the Langevin equation, Eq. (4), describes the passive and the active response in a unified and natural way.\nIt should be noted that the active force, Eq. (5), can be either positive or negative depending on the value of v.\nWhen v 2 is smaller than vc2 (weak stimulation), a positive active force is provided on the BM (active mechanism). On\nthe other hand, when v 2 is larger than vc2 (strong stimulation), a negative active force, hence an extra drag force, is\nexerted on the BM (braking mechanism).\nThe mass density of the BM is known to be about 0.77kg/m2 [19] and the reported damping coefficient, \u03bc, of the\nBM has a large variation from 600 to 63, 000kg m\u22122 s\u22121 [19, 20] depending on the models. For a numerical calculation,\nwe set the damping in the range of 600 \u223c 6, 000kg m\u22122 s\u22121 . It has been reported that the Guinea pig OHCs are able\nto change its length up to 5% when the transmembrane potential is varied. This corresponds to a displacement of\n1\u03bcm for the OHCs of 20\u03bcm at the high-frequency end [21]. Hence, in the regime of high frequency of 10kHz, the\nadjustable parameter vc is roughly estimated about 0.01m/s. By considering the OHC as a capacitor and using the\nobserved membrane potential, membrane capacitance [22], and the scale of the OHC [23], we estimate the value of\nq to be about 0.01kg s\u22123 . The response of the BM to the sound wave can be then obtained straightforwardly\np using\nEqs. (4) and (5). In the following calculations, we set qd2 /c = \u03bc and the characteristic frequency (CF), \u03c9c = \u03ba/\u03c1. It\nwill be shown later that these relations arise from the conditions of the Hopf bifurcation. In the present calculations,\nthe noise width of the distribution is chosen to be zero dB.\nThe compressive and dynamical responses of the BM are obtained as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, respectively. Fig. 1\ndemonstrates that the response of the BM is non-linear and compressive at the CF, while the response is linear at other\nfrequencies. This compressive response of the BM agrees well with the observations [2, 24] as expected. Fig. 2 shows\nthe time course of the BM response, reproducing the experimental observation that the onset time of the response\nis shorter than the offset time, although the onset time is somewhat larger than the experimental values [24]. It is\nimportant to notice that the velocity of the BM increases continuously as long as the stimulation is being turned on if\nthe braking mechanism is not included (vc = \u221e). Hence, the braking mechanism introduced in our model is essential\nto explain the experimental observation at a sufficiently strong stimulation. A dependence of the BM velocity on\nvc is plotted in Fig. 3. The results clearly show that lower critical velocity produces smaller response at the same\nstimulation, thus producing a supercompressive behavior as observed in experiment [24]. This is the effect of the\nbraking mechanism, which is significantly different from the Hopf bifurcation model. Note that the saturation of the\nBM response disappears if the braking mechanism is not considered.\nThe gain of the oscillator is defined as the ratio of the displacement of the BM to the stimulation,\nG=\n\nR\nFpassive\n\n.\n\n(6)\n\nUsing Eq. (4), we obtain the gain, which is a scaling function of the stimulation when the stimulation is not too\n\u22120.65\nlarge, G \u223c Fpassvie\n. This result agrees well with the experiment [2] and the result of the Hopf bifurcation model [6],\n\u22122/3\n\nG \u223c Fpassvie . Indeed our model includes the Hopf model naturally. To show this, we expand the active force, Eq. (5),\nup to the lowest nonlinear term when d2 (1 \u2212 v 2 /vc2 )v 2 /c is small. Eq. (4) is then approximately written as\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd2\nFpassive = \u03c1v\u0307 + \u03bc \u2212 q\nv + \u03baR\nc\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd2\nd2 1\nv3 .\n(7)\n+\n+ q\n2\nc vc\nc\n\n\f6\nCF = 10 kHz\n\n4\n\n10\n\n(a)\n2\n\nVelocity of the BM (\u03bc m/s)\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n5500\n\n6000\n\n6500\n\n7000\n\n7500\n\n8000\n\n8500\n\n9000\n\n9500\n\n10000\n\n800\n\n850\n\n900\n\n950\n\n1000\n\nqd2/c\n\n4\n\n10\n\n(b)\n2\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n550\n\n600\n\n650\n\n700\n\n750\n\nqd2/c\nFIG. 4: The amplification of the thermal noise in the absence of external stimulation. When qd2 /c \u2264 \u03bc, the Brownian fluctuation\nis suppressed, while in the region of qd2 /c > \u03bc, the Brownian fluctuation is amplified. For the plots, the intensity of the\nthermal noise is 0Pa, and the strength of the fluctuation is 0dB. (a) \u03bc = 6, 000kgm\u22122 s\u22121 , vc = 0.01m/s. (b) \u03bc = 600kgm\u22122 s\u22121 ,\nvc = 0.01m/s.\n\nIn the Fourier spectra space, this directly corresponds to the Hopf equation [6] with the following bifurcation conditions,\nr\n\u03ba\n\u03c9c =\n,\n(8)\n\u03c1\nd2\n(9)\n\u03bc = q .\nc\nHence our energy depot model with a braking mechanism reduces to the Hopf bifurcation model in the limit of weak\nstimulation.\nOne of the most important results of our model is an amplification of the thermal noise itself in the absence of an\nexternal stimulation. At the bifurcation point or when qd2 /c < \u03bc, the thermal noise is well suppressed. However,\nwhen qd2 /c > \u03bc, so that too much of the internal energy is converted into the kinetic energy, the thermal noise can\nbe largely amplified as shown in Fig. 4. Here, we set the mean average of the noise at 0Pa and the width at 0dB.\nSince it can be generally assumed that the oscillators are distributed in the vicinity of the bifurcation point, the\nnoise may be amplified incoherently in the absence of the input signal. However, when a weak input signal with the\nsame CF is introduced, it may phase-lock to the already existing amplified noise, thus enhancing the selectivity as\n\n\f7\n\n0.02\n\nf\n\n1\n\nResponse of the BM (a. u.)\n\n0.015\n\nf\n\n2\n\n2f \u2212 f\n\n0.01\n\n1\n\n2f \u2212 f\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0.005\n0\n7.4\n\n7.6\n\n7.8\n\n8.0\n\n8.4\n\n8.2\n\n8.6\n\n8.8\n\n\u22124\n\n5\n\nx 10\n\n2f \u2212 f\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2f2 \u2212 f1\n\n3\n2\n\nf\n\n2\n\nf\n\n1\n\n1\n0\n7.4\n\n7.6\n\n7.8\n\n8.0\n\n8.2\n\n8.4\n\n8.6\n\n8.8\n\nFrequency (kHz)\nFIG. 5: Nonlinear distortion of the response of the BM. f1 = 7.89kHz, f2 = 8.28kHz, both strengths of the stimulation are\n100dB, the response is measured at the place where the CF = 7.89kHz, vc2 = 10\u22125 m2 /s2 and \u03bc = 600kgm\u22122 s\u22121 .\n\ndiscussed in Ref. [25]. Because it is believed that the SBMO is crucial for understanding the spontaneous otoacoustic\nemission [26], our model may provide a clue to explore this interesting and important phenomenon. Fig. 5 shows the\nnonlinear distortion of the response of the BM at the position where the CF is 7.89kHz. The stimulation contains\ntwo tunes, f1 = 7.89kHz and f2 = 8.28kHz. The strengths both are 100dB. Our model shows clearly the distortions\nat 2f1 \u2212 f2 , 2f2 \u2212 f1 in the response of the BM.\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn this paper, we propose a theoretical scheme for the active and passive response of the BM based on a concept of\nthe energy depot model with a braking mechanism. According to the experimental observations, the OHC is assumed\nto play a role of the energy depot by supplying an active force to the BM and also by reabsorbing an excessive kinetic\nenergy like the regenerative-brake system in automobiles and electric vehicles [27] . It is shown that a single equation\nof motion, Eq (4), can produce all the essential passive and active behaviors. Moreover, our model shows that the\nBrownian noise can be sufficiently amplified under a certain condition, thus leading to the SBMO. Although we applied\nour model only to the mammalian cochlea, it is equally possible to be applied to the nonmammalian vertebrates [28]\nbecause the only required physical characteristics are a supply of the active force and a self-adaptation. In this sense,\nwe believe that the concept of the energy depot model with a braking mechanism is quite universal and can be applied\nto any underdamped biological systems.\n\n\f8\nV.\n\nACKNOLEDGEMENT\n\nThis work is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF) (R01-2006-000-10083-0).\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n\nP.
