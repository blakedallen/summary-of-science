INTRODUCTION\n\nAs the most massive fermion in the Standard Model (SM), the top quark is believed to be sensitive to new physics\n[1]. Since the measurements of top quark properties in Run 1 at the Fermilab Tevatron have only small statistics,\nthere remains plenty of room for new physics to be discovered in future precision measurements. Such possibilities\nexist on our horizon: while the upgraded Tevatron collider will significantly improve the precision of the top quark\nmeasurements, the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the planned Next-generation Linear Collider (NLC) will\nserve as top quark factories and allow precision measurements of the top quark properties [2].\nAlthough various exotic production processes [3] and rare decay modes [4] of the top quark will serve as robust\nevidence for new physics (since these exotic processes are forbidden or severely suppressed in the SM), the role of\nthe dominant decay mode t \u2192 W b in probing new physics should not be underestimated [5]. One advantage of this\ndecay mode is that it is free of non-perturbative theoretical uncertainties [6] and future precision experimental data\ncan therefore be compared with accurate theoretical predictions. The other advantage of this channel is that the\nW -boson as decay product is strongly polarized and the helicity contents (transverse-plus W+ , transverse-minus W\u2212\nand longitudinal WL ) of the W -boson can be probed through a measurement of the shape of the lepton spectrum in\nthe W -boson decay [7]. Therefore, the study of top decay into a polarized W -boson will provide additional information\nabout the tW b coupling 1 and has so far attracted a lot of attention from both theorists and experimentalists. On\nthe experimental side, the CDF collaboration has already performed the measurement of the helicity component of\nthe W -boson in top quark decay from Run 1 data and obtained the results\n\u0393L /\u0393 = 0.91 \u00b1 0.37(stat.) \u00b1 0.13(syst.),\n\u0393+ /\u0393 = 0.11 \u00b1 0.15 ,\nwhere \u0393 is the total decay rate of t \u2192 W b, and \u0393L and \u0393+ denote respectively the rates into a longitudinal and\ntransverse-plus W -boson. Although the error of these measurements is quite large at the present time, it is expected\nto be reduced significantly during Run 2 of the Tevatron and may reach 1% \u223c 2% at the LHC [8]. On the theoretical\nside, predictions of these quantities in the SM up to one-loop level are now available [9,10]. For the mass values of\nRefs. [9,10], the tree-level results are 0.703 for \u0393L /\u0393, 0.297 for \u0393\u2212 /\u0393 and O(10\u22124 ) for \u0393+ /\u0393, and the QCD corrections\n\n1\n\nAmong the three polarizations of the W -boson in top decay, the longitudinal mode is of particular interest since it is relevant\nfor the understanding of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism.\n\n1\n\n\fto these predictions are respectively \u22121.07%, 2.19% and 0.10%, while the electroweak corrections are at the level of\na few per mill.\nIn order to probe new physics from the future precise measurement of \u0393L /\u0393, \u0393\u2212 /\u0393 or \u0393+ /\u0393, we must know\nthe new physics contributions to these quantities in various models. In this article we focus on the supersymmetric\ncontributions in the framework of the Minimal Supersymmetric Model (MSSM). In this model the one-loop corrections\nto the total width of t \u2192 bW have been studied by several groups [11\u201315]. However, the corrections to \u0393L /\u0393, \u0393\u2212 /\u0393\nor \u0393+ /\u0393 are still lacking and calculating these corrections is the major goal of this article.\nIn the MSSM the genuine supersymmetric corrections (i.e., the corrections from various sparticle loops) are SUSY\nelectroweak (SUSY-EW) corrections, arising from interactions of charginos or neutralinos, and SUSY-QCD corrections,\narising from interactions of gluinos 2 . The SUSY-EW and SUSY-QCD corrections to the total width were first\ninvestigated in [11,12] without considering squark mixings, and later were re-studied extensively in [13\u201315] by taking\ninto account the squark mixings. Although our aim in this paper is to study the corrections to \u0393L /\u0393, \u0393\u2212 /\u0393 and\n\u0393+ /\u0393, we will also repeat the calculations of the corrections to the total width for two reasons: One of the reasons\nis that the previous SUSY-EW calculations were performed many years ago and some SUSY parameter space viable\nat that time has been ruled out by recent experiments. The other reason is that the SUSY-EW corrections to the\ntotal width were found to be exceptionally large ( exceeds 10% in a large part of parameter space) [13] and should,\ntherefore, be checked carefully. In fact we find they are much smaller for reasons we will discuss.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section II, we present relevant formula for our calculations. In section III,\nSUSY-EW corrections are calculated and compared with previous studies. In section IV, we examine SUSY-QCD\ncorrections. For the numerical calculations of both SUSY-EW and SUSY-QCD corrections, we first perform a scan\nin the typical allowed parameter space to find out the typical size of the corrections, and then consider some special\nscenarios (such as a very light sbottom or gluino) to figure out if the corrections are exceptionally large in some regions\nof parameter space. The conclusions are given in section V.\n\nII. FORMALISM\n\nIn this section we present the formulas for calculating new physics contributions to t \u2192 bW in the so-called \"GF scheme\" [17] where the Fermi constant GF and the pole masses mW , mt , mb , * * * are chosen as input parameters. This\non-shell scheme is the most convenient one for studying such new physics contributions. These formulas are valid for\nstudying one-loop corrections to the decay t \u2192 W b in any renormalizable new physics model.\nThe tW b vertex at one-loop level takes the form [17]\n\u001a\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\u0393\u03bc = \u2212i23/4 GF2 mW Vtb \u03b3\u03bc PL (1 + \u03b4ZbL + \u03b4ZtL + \u03b4Z1W \u2212 \u03b4Z2W \u2212 \u03a0W \u2212 \u2206rnew + FL )\n2\n2\n2\n2\n+\u03b3\u03bc PR FR + pt\u03bc PL HL + pt\u03bc PR HR } .\n(1)\nHere PR,L \u2261 21 (1 \u00b1 \u03b35 ) are the chirality projectors. The form factors FL,R and HL,R represent the contributions from\nthe irreducible vertex loops. (For the comparison of our results with Ref. [13], we adopted the same notations for the\nform factors as in Ref. [13].) \u03b4ZbL and \u03b4ZtL denote respectively the field renormalization constant for bottom quark\nW\nand top quark. \u03b4Z1,2\nare the renormalization constants for the SU (2) gauge fields W\u03bca and the coupling constant g2 ,\na\nW 1/2\nW\nW\ndefined as W\u03bc \u2192 (Z2 ) W\u03bca and g2 \u2192 Z1W (Z2W )\u22123/2 g2 with Z1,2\n\u2261 1 + \u03b4Z1,2\n.

In our following calculations, we retain the\nbottom quark mass only when it appears in couplings or in the sbottom mass matrix [19] since in those cases the\nbottom quark mass is multiplied by tan \u03b2 and can not be neglected for large tan \u03b2.\nWe define the ratios\n\u0393\u0302L,\u2212 = \u0393L,\u2212 /\u0393,\n\n(10)\n\nwhich can be measured in experiments.

SUSY ELECTROWEAK CORRECTIONS\n\nIn this section we investigate the SUSY electroweak corrections. First we consider vertex corrections and quark\nself-energy corrections as depicted in Fig. 1. This part of the corrections are expected to be sizable for large tan \u03b2. In\nAppendix A, we list in detail the relevant Feynman rules and present our analytical results. We checked that our results\n\n3\n\nFor the construction of covariant polarization vector of W -boson, see Eq.(5.16) in [18].\n\n3\n\n\fdo reduce to those in [11] when switching off squark mixings and neglecting the b-quark mass in quark-squark-chargino\n(or neutralino) interactions.\nW\nThe SUSY-EW contributions to the self-energies of gauge bosons, which are necessary to calculate for \u03b4Z1,2\nand\n\u03a0W , have been calculated by several groups [11,20]. We recalculated them and find that our results agree with those\nin [11] when switching off squark mixings. In our numerical calculations we will take into account the mixings between\ntop-squarks and between sbottoms.\nAs to the SUSY-EW contributions to \u2206r, both the universal and non-universal parts are nicely presented in [21].\nWe checked the analytic expressions and incorporated them in our FORTRAN code. Our numerical results show that\nW\nthe total contribution to the width \u0393(t \u2192 W b) from \u03b4Z1,2\n, \u03a0W and \u2206rSUSY\u2212EW is generally less than 1%.\n\nb\nt\n\nt~\n\ni\n\n\u001f~0j\n\nb\n\nt~\n\nt~ (~b\n\nb t\n\n\u001f~+i (\u001f~0j )\n\nt\n\nb\n\n( )\n\n\u001f~0j\nW+\n\n)\n\n\u001f~+i (\u001f~0j )\n\nd\n\nb\n\n~\n\n\u001f~+i\n\nW+\n\nb\n\n( )\n\n~ (~ )\n\nt\n\nt\n\n~\n\nW+\n\na\n\n( )\n\nb\n\nj\n\nt\n\n\u001f~+\n\nb\n\n\u001f~0\n\nb\n\ne\n\n( )\n\n( )\n\nFIG. 1.

SUSY electroweak corrections to the width \u0393(t \u2192 W b) versus sbottom mass. The solid curve is our result and the\ndashed curve is taken from Fig. 7 of Ref.[13]. The input parameters are those of case C in Fig. 7 in Ref.[13].\n\nAs pointed out in Appendix A, our vertex corrections are quite different from those in [13]. To see the numerical\n4\n\n\fdifference between our results and those in [13], we present a comparison in Fig. 2, which corresponds to the case C\nof Fig. 7 in [13]. We see from Fig. 2 that the difference is significant. The results of [13] are much larger in magnitude\nthan ours: in a large part of parameter space the results of [13] exceed 10% in size while our results are below 5%.\nFig. 2 also shows a common feature for both results, namely, there exists a peak in the correction at mb\u0303 \u2243 109\nGeV. This peak comes from the \"threshold effect\" [22], which is explained in Appendix B.\nNote that some of the input parameters in Fig. 2, which were allowed at the time when the calculations in [13] were\nperformed, may no longer be allowed nowadays. In our following numerical calculations, we will consider the current\nconstraints on the parameters.\nThe relevant SUSY parameters in our calculations are: (1) tan \u03b2, M\u0303Q , M\u0303U , M\u0303D , \u03bc and At,b which enter the mass\nmatrices of top-squark and sbottom [19] (see Appendix A); (2) soft-breaking gaugino masses M\u03031 and M\u03032 appearing\nin the chargino and neutralino mass matrices (see Appendix A); (3) the masses of sleptons and the squarks of the first\nW\ntwo generations involved in the calculation of \u03b4Z1,2\n, \u03a0W and \u2206rSUSY\u2212EW . To lessen the number of the parameters in\n(3), we assume an universal soft breaking parameter M\u0303L and neglect left-right mixings for sleptons and the squarks of\nthe first two generations. Such assumptions do not affect our numerical results significantly since, as we said before,\nW\nthe contributions from \u03b4Z1,2\n, \u03a0W and \u2206rnew are small for the allowed parameter space. As for the soft breaking\ngaugino mass parameters M\u03031 and M\u03032 , we assume the relation M\u03031 \u2243 0.5M\u03032 [23]. With these assumptions the relevant\nSUSY parameters are reduced to\nm\u0303Q , m\u0303U , m\u0303D , At , Ab , \u03bc, tan \u03b2, M\u0303L , M\u03032 .\n\n(11)\n\nTo estimate the size of the SUSY-EW effects, we first performed a scan over the nine parameters in Eq. (11).\nIn our scan we restricted the parameters with mass dimensions to be less than 1 TeV and considered the following\nexperimental constraints:\n(1) \u03bc > 0 and a large tan \u03b2 in the range 5 \u2264 tan \u03b2 \u2264 70, which seems to be favored by the muon g \u2212 2 measurement [24].\n(2) \u03b4\u03c1 < 0.002 [25], which will constrain the mass splitting between stops and sbottoms. (We use the program\nFeynHiggs [26] to generate the values of \u03b4\u03c1 and the Higgs masses.)\n(3) The LEP and CDF lower mass bounds on sparticles and the lightest CP-even Higgs boson [25,27]\nmt\u0303 \u2265 86.4 GeV, mb\u0303 \u2265 75.0 GeV, m\u03c7\u0303+ \u2265 67.7 GeV, m\u03c7\u03030 \u2265 40 GeV,\nml\u0303 \u2265 95 GeV, m\u03bd\u0303 \u2265 41 GeV, mq\u0303 \u2265 138 GeV, mh0 \u2265 91 GeV,\nwhere mq\u0303 denotes the mass of squarks of the first two generations.\n1\n\n\u25cf SUSY-EW CORRECTION\n\u25b2 SUSY-QCD CORRECTION\n\n\u03b4\u0393 / \u0393 0 (%)\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n-1\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0\n\n\u02c6 L / \u02c6\u0393L (%)\n\u03b4\u0393\nFIG. 3.

In our calculations throughout this paper,\nwe have fixed GF = 1.16637 \u00d7 10\u22125 GeV\u22122 , mW = 80.451 GeV, mt = 174.3 GeV and mb = 4.8 GeV. Fig. 3 shows\nthat the SUSY-EW correction is generally below one percent in size and tends to be positive for \u0393 and negative for\n\u0393\u0302L .\nAlthough the SUSY-EW correction turns out to be quite small (below one percent in size) in the dominant part\nof the allowed parameter space, we found from our scan that the correction can reach a few percent in some narrow\ncorners of the parameter space. These corners have two feathers: (1) \u03bc \u226a M\u03032 so that the lighter chargino and\nthe lightest neutralino are Higgsino-like, and tan \u03b2 is large so that the b-quark Yukawa couplings in quark-squarkHiggsino interactions can be greatly enhanced [19]; (2) The two sparticles in a self-energy loop of top quark lie below\nthe threshold, or in other words, the sum of the masses of the two sparticles is lighter than top quark mass. Generally\nspeaking, for mb \u03031 + m\u03c7\u0303+ < mt the sbottom(b\u03031 )-chargino(\u03c7\u0303+\n1 ) loop can give a relatively large contribution. With the\n1\nincrease of mb \u03031 and m\u03c7\u0303+ , the contributions from this loop decrease as required by a decoupling theorem. A peak in\n1\ncorrection size occurs at mb\u03031 + m\u03c7\u0303+ = mt , as shown in Fig. 2 and explained in Appendix B. To show the size of the\n1\ncorrections in such corners of the parameter space, we present some numerical results in two special scenarios:\n\u2022 Scenario I: We assume \u03bc \u226a M2 and assume an universal soft-breaking mass MSUSY for squarks.\n\u2022 Scenario II: We assume a very light sbottom b\u03031 of about 5 GeV. So far such a light sbottom has not been ruled\nout by current experiments if the sbottom mixing angle \u03b8b is tuned to satisfy cos \u03b8b \u2243 0.38 [28]. For such a light\nsbottom, tan \u03b2 must be large enough to cause a sufficiently large mass splitting between the two sbottom mass\neigenstates. In addition, the lighter top-squark t\u03031 cannot be heavier than 300 GeV in order to satisfy the \u03b4\u03c1\nbound.\nThe results in Scenario I are plotted in Figs. 4 and 5. We present our result only in the region where the constraints\ngiven in the paragraph following Eq.(11) are satisfied. The peaks in these figures happen at mb\u03031 + m\u03c7\u0303+ = mt where\n1\nmb\u03031 and m\u03c7\u0303+ are the lighter sbottom and top-squark masses, respectively. Fig. 4 shows that below the threshold\n1\nthe SUSY-EW corrections to the width can be as large as 3% for tan \u03b2 \u2265 50 and after crossing the threshold, the\ncorrections change sharply to \u22128% and then quickly decrease in size. Concerning the behavior at threshold, we want\nto point out that the results within the region 0 \u2264 mb\u0303 + m\u03c7\u0303 \u2212 mt < \u0393/2 are not reliable since perturbative expansion\nof the S-matrix element breaks down for these points [13] (also see discussions in Appendix B). Fig. 5 shows that\n\u03b4 \u0393\u0302\u2212 /\u0393\u03020\u2212 can reach 1% near the threshold and its size is generally larger than that of \u03b4 \u0393\u0302L /\u0393\u03020L .\nScenario I\nSUSY-EW EFFECT\n\u03bc = 80 GeV\n~\nM2 = 400 GeV\n\n2\n\ntan \u03b2=70\n\ntan \u03b2 =30\ntan \u03b2=50\n\n\u03b4\u0393 / \u03930 (%)\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n-6\n\n-8\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\n220\n\nMSUSY (GeV)\nFIG. 4.

For numerical calculations in Scenario II, it is inconvenient to take the parameters in\nEq.(11) as input. Instead, we may choose\nmb\u03031 , mt\u03031 , mt\u03032 , \u03bc, Ab , \u03b8b , tan \u03b2, M\u0303L , M\u03032\n\n(13)\n\nas input parameters. Using the formula listed in Appendix A, one may relate these two sets of parameters. In our\nnumerical calculations, we keep \u03bc and tan \u03b2 as variables and study the dependence on them. Other parameters are\nfixed to be4\nmt\u03031 = 150 GeV, mt\u03032 = 500 GeV, M\u0303L = Ab = 300 GeV,\nmb\u03031 = 5 GeV, cos \u03b8b = 0.38, M\u03032 = 400 GeV.\n\n(14)\n\nNote that we fixed such values for mb\u03031 and cos \u03b8b since this scenario is characterized by assuming a very light sbottom\nb\u03031 of about 5 GeV with the sbottom mixing angle sytisfying cos \u03b8b \u2243 0.38 (see the definition of this scenario).\nThe results in Scenario II are plotted in Figs. 6 and 7. In Fig. 6 we plot \u03b4\u0393/\u03930 versus \u03bc and in Fig. 7 we plot\n\u03b4 \u0393\u0302\u2212,L /\u0393\u03020\u2212,L and \u03b4 \u0393\u0302\u2212/L /\u0393\u03020\u2212/L versus \u03bc. Again we see that a large tan \u03b2 can cause large SUSY-EW corrections. Fig. 6\nshows a broad region of \u03bc in which corrections to the width can be a few percent. Like in Fig. 4 the peaks occur at\nmb\u03031 + m+\n\u03c7\u0303 = mt . Fig.7 shows that, like in Scenario I, the SUSY-EW corrections to \u0393\u0302\u2212 and \u0393\u0302L are of opposite sign\nand the size of the former is larger than that of the latter.\n\n4\n\nWe found from numerical calculations that the results are not sensitive to the parameters mt\u03031 , mt\u03032 , M\u0303L and Ab .\n\n7\n\n\fScenario II\n\n3\n\nn\u03b2\n=7\n0\n\nSUSY-EW EFFECT\n\nta\n\n2\n\n\u03b4\u0393 / \u03930 (%)\n\n1\n\ntan\n\n0\n\n\u03b2=3\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n80\n\n120\n\n160\n\n200\n\n240\n\n\u03bc (GeV)\nFIG. 6.

[15]\nfor the same choice of parameters.\nThe parameters involved in numerical evaluations are the gluino mass mg\u0303 , and the parameters m\u0303Q , m\u0303U , m\u0303D , At , Ab ,\n\u03bc and tan \u03b2 which enter the mass matrices of top-squark and sbottom [19]. In order to compare the size of SUSY-QCD\ncorrections with that of SUSY-EW corrections, we have shown our scan results of SUSY-QCD corrections already\nin Fig. 3 in the preceding section. In our scan we have considered the relevant constraints given in the paragraph\nfollowing Eq.(11) and we also required mg\u0303 \u2265 200 GeV, which is the current experimental bound for the gluino in\nthe framework of the minimal supergravity model [25]. From Fig. 3 one sees that the SUSY-QCD corrections and\nSUSY-EW corrections tend to have opposite signs and thus may cancel in large parts of parameter space. This differs\ndrastically from the conclusion of Ref. [13,14] which claims that the two type corrections have the same sign and thus\nthe combined contribution can reduce the width \u0393(t \u2192 W b) by as much as 25%.\nWe see from Fig. 3 that in the allowed parameter space with mg\u0303 > 200 GeV the SUSY-QCD corrections are smaller\nthan 1% in magnitude. However, we found that the corrections can reach a few percent in some corners of the\nparameter space if we relax the bound mg\u0303 \u2265 200 GeV (this bound is model-dependent). In the following we present\nsome numerical results by relaxing this bound mg\u0303 \u2265 200 GeV, and in order to compare with SUSY-EW corrections\nwe consider the same two scenarios as in the preceding section.\nThe results in Scenario I are plotted in Figs. 9 and 10 for different mg\u0303 values in the allowed region of MSUSY . We\nfixed \u03bc = 80 GeV and tan \u03b2 = 70, and included the possibility of a very light gluino of 16 GeV, which has not been\nexcluded by current experiments 5 (for comparison we also plot a curve with a 100 GeV gluino although it may be\nseverely disfavored by existing experiments). Fig. 9 shows that the magnitude of SUSY-QCD corrections decrease as\nMSUSY or mg\u0303 becomes large. Comparing with the SUSY-EW corrections in Fig. 4, one sees that the maximum size\nof the SUSY-QCD corrections is smaller than that of the SUSY-EW corrections, which can be greatly enhanced by\nthe b-quark Yukawa coupling for large tan \u03b2.\n\n5\n\nSuch a very light gluino has not been excluded by experiments and was recently used to solve the long-standing b-quark\nproduction puzzle [29]. To achieve that, a light sbottom of about 5 GeV is also required, which leads to a stronger constraint\nfrom Rb on the SUSY parameters [30].\n\n9\n\n\f0\n\n=200 GeV\nm~\ng\n\n-0.5\n\neV\n\n\u03b4\u0393 / \u0393 0 (%)\n\n=100 G\nm~\ng\n\nV\n\n6\n=1\nm~g\n\n-1\n\nScenario I\nSUSY-QCD EFFECT\n\u03bc = 80 GeV\ntan \u03b2 = 70\n\n-1.5\n\n-2\n\nGe\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\n220\n\n240\n\nMSUSY (GeV)\nFIG. 9.

Similar to the SUSY-EW case, in Scenario II it is convenient to choose\nmb\u03031 , mt\u03031 , mt\u03032 , \u03bc, Ab , \u03b8b , tan \u03b2, mg\u0303\n10\n\n(15)\n\n\fas input parameters.

Since in this scenario we assume a very light sbottom\n(mb\u03031 = 5 GeV), we do not consider the possibility of a very light gluino (mg\u0303 = 16 GeV) due to the Rb constraints [30].\nFrom the figures we see that for a mt\u03031 = 100 GeV and mg\u0303 = 100 GeV, SUSY-QCD corrections can reach \u22123%,\ncomparable in magnitude with SUSY-EW corrections.\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n00\nm~g=2\n\nGeV\n\n\u03b4\u0393 / \u03930 (%)\n\n-1\n\nV\n\n0\n10\n\nGe\n\n=\nm~g\n\n-1.5\n\nScenario II\nSUSY-QCD EFFECT\n\n-2\n\n-2.5\n\n-3\n\n100\n\n125\n\n150\n\n175\n\n200\n\nMt~1(GeV)\n\n(%)\n\nFIG. 11.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\n\nWe investigated the one-loop SUSY-QCD and SUSY-EW corrections to the top quark decay into a b-quark\nand a longitudinal or transverse W -boson. The corrections are presented in terms of the longitudinal ratio\n\u0393(t \u2192 WL b)/\u0393(t \u2192 W b) and the transverse ratio \u0393(t \u2192 W\u2212 b)/\u0393(t \u2192 W b). In order to compare with the existing results in the literature, we also present the corrections to the total width \u0393(t \u2192 W b). To find out the typical size\nof these corrections, we performed a scan in the typical allowed parameter space. In order to decide if the corrections\nare exceptionally large in certain corners of the parameter space, we then considered some special scenarios (such as\na very light sbottom or gluino). Our observations are:\n(1) In most of the parameter space, both SUSY-QCD and SUSY-EW corrections to the ratios are less than 1% in\nmagnitude and they tend to have opposite signs. Only in some corners of the parameter space the corrections\ncan reach a few percent.\n(2) The corrections to the total width \u0393(t \u2192 W b) agree well with previous calculations for the SUSY-QCD part,\nbut differ significantly from previous calculations for the SUSY-EW part. Unlike the previous studies, which\nshowed a large SUSY-EW correction of more than 10% in magnitude for a large part of the parameter space,\nour SUSY-EW results are only a few percent at most.\nWe conclude by remarking that these SUSY corrections, despite their smallness in size, should be taken into account\nin the future precision tests of the top quark decay t \u2192 W b to determine whether SUSY is indeed the new physics\nchosen by Nature. (As far as we know, the corrections to the tW b coupling in other kinds of new physics models\nare also very small [31].) However, from the viewpoint of probing SUSY through revealing its effects in the coupling\ntW b, the decay t \u2192 W b may not be the best channel. Some single top quark production channels proceeding through\nthe tW b coupling may be complementary or even do better in this aspect. For example, SUSY effects in the tW b\ncoupling may cause observable effects in single top quark production in hadron collisions [32], and the single top\nquark production via electron-photon collision at a future linear collider is also quite sensitive to anomalous tW b\ncoupling [33].\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nThis work is supported in part by the Chinese Natural Science Foundation and by the US Department of Energy,\nDivision of High Energy Physics under grant No. DE-FG02-91-ER4086.\nAPPENDIX A: SUSY-EW LOOP RESULTS\n\nIn this appendix we first list the mass matrices of sfermions, charginos and neutralinos involved in our calculations,\nthen write down the relevant interaction Lagrangian and finally present the explicit expressions of the SUSY-EW\ncontributions from the loop diagrams shown in Fig.1.\n\n1. Mass matrices of sfermions, charginos and neutralinos\n\nAssuming no generation mixing for squarks in the soft-breaking terms, the mass-square matrices for up-type and\ndown-type squarks in each generation are given respectively by [19]\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\nM\u0303Q + m2Z cos 2\u03b2( 12 \u2212 eu sin2 \u03b8W ) + m2u\nmu (Au \u2212 \u03bc cot \u03b2)\n2\nM\u0169 =\n,\n(A1)\nmu (Au \u2212 \u03bc cot \u03b2)\nM\u0303U2 + m2Z cos 2\u03b2eu sin2 \u03b8W + m2u\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\nmd (Ad \u2212 \u03bc tan \u03b2)\nM\u0303Q \u2212 m2Z cos 2\u03b2( 12 + ed sin2 \u03b8W ) + m2d\n,\n(A2)\nMd\u03032 =\n2\nmd (Ad \u2212 \u03bc tan \u03b2)\nM\u0303D + m2Z cos 2\u03b2ed sin2 \u03b8W + m2d\nwhere M\u0303Q , M\u0303U and M\u0303D are soft-breaking mass terms for left-handed squark doublet, right-handed up and down\nsquarks, respectively. Au (Ad ) is the coefficient of the trilinear term H2 Q\u0303\u0168 (H1 Q\u0303D\u0303) in soft-breaking terms, and\ntan \u03b2 = v2 /v1 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets.\n\n12\n\n\fFor the first two generation squarks, the left-right mixings can be neglected due to the smallness of relevant quark\nmasses and thus the weak-eigenstates are mass-eigenstates. From Eqs.(A1,A2), we then get the relation between the\nleft-handed up-type squark mass M\u0169L and the left-handed down-type squark mass Md\u0303L\nM\u01692L = Md\u03032L + m2Z cos 2\u03b2(1 \u2212 sin2 \u03b8W ) + m2u \u2212 m2d .\n\n(A3)\n\nFor the third generation squarks, the left-right mixings cannot be neglected and the mass-eigenstates q\u03031,2 (q = t, b)\nare related to the weak-eigenstates q\u0303L,R by an unitary rotation R\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\nq\u03031\nq\u0303L\ncos \u03b8q sin \u03b8q\nq\u0303L\n=R\n\u2261\n,\n(A4)\nq\u03032\nq\u0303R\n\u2212 sin \u03b8q cos \u03b8q\nq\u0303R\nwhere \u03b8q is the so-called mixing angle between q\u0303L and q\u0303R .\nThe mass-square matrices in Eqs.(A1, A2) can be alternatively expressed by the squark masses and mixing angle\nas\n\u0013\n\u0012\ncos2 \u03b8q m2q\u03031 + sin2 \u03b8q m2q\u03032 sin \u03b8q cos \u03b8q (m2q\u03031 \u2212 m2q\u03032 )\n.\n(A5)\nMq\u03032 =\nsin \u03b8q cos \u03b8q (m2q\u03031 \u2212 m2q\u03032 ) sin2 \u03b8q m2q\u03031 + cos2 \u03b8q m2q\u03032\nBy comparing Eq.(A5) with Eqs.(A1, A2), one can obtain the relationship between the two set of input parameters\nin the squark sector, (mq\u03031 , mq\u03032 , \u03b8q ) and (M\u0303Q , M\u0303U , M\u0303D , At,b , \u03bc). The mass matrices for sleptons take the similar\nforms as for squarks. But due to the smallness of lepton masses, the left-right mixings can be neglected for the three\ngenerations.\nThe mass matrices of charginos and neutralinos are also involved in our calculations.

One point we want to mention is that U , V and N\ndefined in Eq.(A6, A8) are not unique and one should choose U , V and N in a way that all the masses of charginos\nand neutralinos are positive.\n2.

The analytic results of [13] seem to have some explicit\nerrors, e.g., it seems to be impossible to cancel the UV divergence in FL , terms like mt C0 should not appear in HL,R\nand G2 and G3 should be interchanged.\nAPPENDIX B: EXPLANATION OF THRESHOLD BEHAVIORS\n\u2032\nThe two-point loop functions B0,1\n(p, m1 , m2 )|p2 =m2t enter our results via \u03b4ZtL . In order to explain the threshold\n\u2032\nbehavior in Figs.(2, 4, 6), we study the behavior of B0,1\n(m0 , m1 , m2 ) near the threshold point m0 = m1 + m2 . We\ntake B0\u2032 as an example, the behavior of B1\u2032 is similar.\nFor fixed m0 and m2 , B0\u2032 (m0 , m1 , m2 ) as a function of m1 can be expressed as\n\nB0\u2032\n\n=\n\n=\n\nwhere\n\nZ\n\n1\n\nx \u2212 x2\ndx\n\u2212 m22 )x + m21\n\nm20 x2 \u2212 (m20 + m21\n\uf8f10\nR 1 x\u2212x2\n1\n\uf8f4\n2\n\uf8f4\nm\n\uf8f2 0 R0 (x\u2212a)22 \u2212b2 dx\n1 x\u2212x\n1\ndx\nm20 0 (x\u2212a)2\n\uf8f4\nR\n2\n\uf8f4\n1\nx\u2212x\n\uf8f3 12\ndx\nm0 0 (x\u2212a)2 +b2\n\nfor\n\nfor\nfor\n\nm1 < m0 \u2212 m2 ,\n\nm1 = m0 \u2212 m2 ,\n\nm1 > m0 \u2212 m2 ,\n\nm20 + m21 \u2212 m22\n,\n2m20\n1 p\nb=\n|(m0 + m1 + m2 )(m0 + m1 \u2212 m2 )(m0 \u2212 m1 + m2 )(m0 \u2212 m1 \u2212 m2 )| .\n2m20\n\na=\n\n(B1)\n\n(B2)\n(B3)\n\nFrom Eq.(B1), one may infer that, in regions below threshold (m1 < m0 \u2212 m2 ) or above threshold (m1 > m0 \u2212 m2 ),\nB0\u2032 is an continuous function of m1 . At the threshold point (m1 = m0 \u2212 m2 ), B0\u2032 is divergent due to the fact 0 < a < 1.\n(In some calculation programs, such as LoopTools [35] used in our calculations, an imaginary part is added to the\npropagators in the loops to avoid the divergence at the threshold point.)\nIn the limit m1 \u2192 m0 \u2212 m2 from the lower (i.e. m1 < m0 \u2212 m2 ), one has B0\u2032 \u2192 \u22122 + (1 \u2212 2a) ln [(1 \u2212 a)/a] which\nis a finite value and corresponds to the top points in Figs.(2, 4, 6). But in the limit m1 \u2192 m0 \u2212 m2 from the upper\n(i.e. m1 > m0 \u2212 m2 ), one has B0\u2032 \u2192 \u221e which corresponds to the bottom point in Figs.(2, 4, 6). Since these bottom\npoints tend to take very large negative values, the perturbative calculation is not reliable at these points and a special\ntreatment is needed [36].\n\n[1] For example, top-pair production at hadron collisions are quite sensitive to new physics.
