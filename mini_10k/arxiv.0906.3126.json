Introduction\nIn the simplest curvaton mechanism [1], primordial perturbations originate from\nquantum fluctuations of a light scalar field which gives a negligible contribution to\nthe total energy density during inflation. This field is called the curvaton \u03c3. Inflation is driven by another scalar, the inflaton \u03c6, whose potential energy dominates the\nuniverse. After the end of inflation, the inflaton decays into radiation. If the infla\u221a\ntionary scale is low enough, H\u2217 \u226a 10\u22125 \u01eb\u2217 , the density fluctuations of the radiation\ncomponent are much below the observed amplitude \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1 \u223c 10\u22125 and the fluid is for\npractical purposes homogeneous. While the dominant radiation energy scales away\nas \u03c1r \u223c a\u22124 , the curvaton energy gets diluted at a slower rate, at least for quadratic\ncurvaton potentials. The curvaton contribution to the total energy density therefore\nincreases and the initially negligible curvaton perturbations get imprinted into metric\nfluctuations. The standard adiabatic hot big bang era is recovered when the curvaton eventually decays and thermalizes with the existing radiation. The mechanism\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fcan be seen as a conversion of initial isocurvature perturbations into adiabatic ones\nand, depending on the parameters of the model, is capable of generating all of the\nobserved primordial perturbation.\nThe scenario sketched above represents the simplest possible realization of the\ncurvaton mechanism and a wide range of different variations of the idea have been\nstudied in the literature. For example, the inflaton perturbations need not be negligible [2], there could be several curvatons [3], the curvaton decay can result into\nresidual isocurvature perturbations [4, 5] and inflation could be driven by some other\nmechanism than slowly rolling scalars [6]. Recently it has been pointed out that the\ncurvaton can decay via a parametric resonance [7] (see also [8]) with potentially interesting observational consequences. It is also well known that the predictions of\nthe curvaton model are quite sensitive to the form of the curvaton potential. In\nparticular, even small deviations from the extensively studied quadratic potential\ncan have a significant effect, at least when considering non-Gaussian effects [9, 10].\nHowever, thus far the predictions of a curvaton scenario with self-interactions have\nnot been properly studied. This is the aim of the present paper.\nWe explore in detail the curvaton scenario with the potential given by\n\u03c3 n+4\n1 2 2\nm\n\u03c3\n+\n\u03bb\n,\nV =\n2\nMn\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere n is an even integer to keep the potential bounded from below and the interaction term is suppressed by a cut-off scale M. For non-renormalizable operators\nn > 0 we set the cut-off scale to be the Planck scale, i.e. set M = MP , and the\ncoupling to unity, \u03bb = 1. For the renormalizable quartic case n = 0, we treat the\ncoupling \u03bb as a free parameter. For the rest of the paper we set Planck mass to unity\nMP \u2261 (8\u03c0G)\u22121/2 = 1.\nOur approach is purely phenomenological and we do not explicitly connect our\ndiscussion to any particle physics model in this work. Even without a concrete model\nin mind, the study of the potential (1.1) is however well motivated by generic theoretical arguments. Indeed, the curvaton should have interactions of some kind as it\neventually must decay and produce Standard Model fields. The curvaton needs to be\nweakly interacting to keep the field light during inflation. This however only implies\nthat the effective curvaton potential should be sufficiently flat in the vicinity of the\nfield expectation value during inflation but does not a priori require the interaction\nterms in (1.1) to be negligible. Moreover, as the inflationary energy scale is relatively\nhigh, the field can be displaced far from the origin and therefore feel the presence\nof higher order terms in the potential. The interactions could arise either as pure\ncurvaton self-interactions involving the field \u03c3 alone or more generically as effective\nterms due to curvaton couplings to other (heavy) degrees of freedom that have been\nintegrated out. An example of a possible physical setup which could lead to (1.1) is\ngiven by flat directions of supersymmetric models that have been suggested as cur-\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fvaton candidates [11]. This would lead to a potential of the form (1.1) with typically\na relatively large power for the non-renormalizable operator.\nWe consider for simplicity a perturbative curvaton decay characterized by some\ndecay width \u0393 and do not address the possibility of a non-perturbative decay [7].\nOur analysis is numerical and covers both the regions of small and large interactions\nin (1.1) as compared to the quadratic part. For small interactions, the deviations\nfrom quadratic results appear mostly when considering beyond leading order properties like non-gaussianties [9, 10]. The opposite case with large interactions is much\nless studied, although some work has been done [12, 13], and is therefore of primary interest for the current work. When the interaction term dominates in (1.1),\nthe curvaton oscillations start in a non-quadratic potential and the curvaton energy\ndensity always decreases faster than for a quadratic case. For non-renormalizable\ninteractions, the decrease is even faster than the red-shifting of the background radiation and the curvaton contribution to the total energy density is decreasing at the\nbeginning of oscillations. Consequently, the amplification of the curvaton component\nis less efficient than for a quadratic model. For the same values for m and \u0393, the\ncurvaton typically ends up being more subdominant at the time of its decay than in\nthe quadratic case. This we call the subdominant curvaton scenario.\nDespite the subdominance, the curvaton scenario can yield the correct amplitude\nof primordial perturbations as the relative curvaton perturbations \u03b4\u03c3\u2217 /\u03c3\u2217 produced\nduring inflation can be much larger than 10\u22125 . For a quadratic model, it is well\nknown that the curvaton should make up at least few per cents of the total energy\ndensity at the time of its decay, r = \u03c1\u03c3 /\u03c1r & O(10\u22122), in order not to generate\ntoo large non-Gaussianities [4, 14]. This bound does not directly apply to the nonquadratic model (1.1) since the dynamics is much more complicated. Although the\nsubdominant curvaton scenario implies relatively large perturbations \u03b4\u03c3\u2217 /\u03c3\u2217 , the\nhigher order terms in the perturbative expansion of curvature perturbation can be\naccidentally suppressed [9, 10]. Although the study of non-Gaussianities is of great\nimportance, stringent constraints on model building already come from the amplitude\nof CMB fluctuations. Therefore, in the present paper we focus on exploring the\nparameter space that produces the observed amplitude for the model (1.1) and leave\nthe study of non-Gaussianities for a separate publication. As it will turn out, already\nthis first step does place quite non-trivial constraints on the viable parameter space.\nWe find that the observed 10\u22125 amplitude of primordial perturbations can be\nproduced for all the interaction terms, n = 0, 2, 4, 6, in (1.1) which we consider. To\nillustrate the resulting constraints for the model parameters, we represent the corresponding value of r = \u03c1\u03c3 /\u03c1r at the decay time as a function of the inflationary scale\nH\u2217 and the curvaton energy during inflation r\u2217 . This describes how subdominant\nthe curvaton ends up being at the time of its decay. For the special case of quartic\nself-interactions, n = 0, we also present a new analytical approach which can be\nused to estimate the curvature perturbation and compare this with our numerical\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fanalysis. Our results imply that, as far as the amplitude of perturbations is concerned, the interacting model (1.1) is compatible with observations even for large\ninteractions. This completes the first step in determining the observational status of\nthe model (1.1) and makes the study of the non-Gaussianities both well motivated\nand a necessary task to complete the work.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we describe the subdominant\ncurvaton model, the associated constraints, and discuss the qualitative features of\nthe evolution of the curvaton energy density and the primordial perturbation. Sect.\n3 contains our numerical results. In Sect. 4 we present an analytical, approximate\nsolution for the curvature perturbation in the case of a curvaton models which is a\ncombination of a quartic and quadratic parts. Finally, in Sect. 5 we give a discussion\nof the results.\n\n2. The subdominant curvaton model\n2.1 Model constraints\nWe consider a phenomenological curvaton potential (1.1) where m is the curvaton\nmass and the last term represents the leading interaction term. For n = 0 we obtain\nmarginally renormalizable four-point interaction. Larger exponents correspond to\nnon-renormalizable operators and for these we set \u03bb = 1 and assume the associated\ncut-off scale is given by the Planck mass M = MP = 1. We choose to consider even\ninteger values for n to keep the potential bounded from below. The exponent values\nconsidered in detail in this paper are n = 0, 2, 4, 6. For n > 6 there are no field\noscillations in the non-quadratic part of the potential; as a consequence, are of no\ngreat interest.\nFor the purposes of the present paper we assume for definiteness that the inflaton\ndecays instantly to radiation so that \u03c1(\u03c6end ) = 3H\u22172 = \u03c1r . After inflation ends, the\ncurvaton field must also eventually decay. We consider a perturbative curvaton decay\ncharacterized by a constant decay rate \u0393, although the curvaton could also decay nonperturbatively by way of a parametric resonance [7]. The potential (1.1) then gives\nrise to a coupled set of equations of motion in a radiation dominated background:\n\u03c3\u0308 + (3H + \u0393) \u03c3\u0307 + m2 \u03c3 + \u03bb (n + 4) \u03c3 n+3 = 0\n\u03c1 \u0307r = \u22124H\u03c1r + \u0393\u03c3\u0307 2\n3H 2 = \u03c1r + \u03c1\u03c3 ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere \u03c1r is the radiation density and \u03c1\u03c3 the curvaton density. We denote the relative\ncurvaton energy density by\n\u03c1\u03c3\nr\u2261\n.\n(2.2)\n\u03c1r\nThe time evolution of r and therefore the rate of the amplification of the curvaton\ncomponent depends on the order n of the interaction term in (1.1). In addition\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fto n, the curvaton mass m, and the decay width \u0393, the solutions to the equations\nof motion depend on two initial conditions: the value of the inflationary scale H\u2217 ,\nand the initial curvaton value \u03c3\u2217 which can be equivalently expressed in terms of\nthe initial curvaton energy density r\u2217 \u223c \u03c1\u03c3\u2217 /H\u22172 . In principle, these are all free\nparameters albeit subject to the constraint coming from requirement of curvaton\nsubdominance during inflation r\u2217 \u226a 1 and masslessness V \u2032\u2032 \u226a H\u22172 . Moreover, we\nassume that the curvature perturbations generated during inflation are negligible\nand that the evolution of H\u2217 is such that it gives rise to the correct spectral index\nfor the curvaton perturbations. For example, a single field slow roll inflation with\n\u221a\nH\u2217 \u226a 10\u22125 \u01eb\u2217 and \u01eb\u2217 \u223c 10\u22122 satisfies these conditions.\nAn additional constraint comes from the time of the curvaton decay which should\ntake place early enough so as not to spoil the success of the adiabatic hot big bang\nmodel. In particular, we require that the curvaton must produce only curvature\nand not (large) isocurvature perturbations. This corresponds to the situation where\nradiation and dark matter have both the same perturbation. Hence, we need to\nrequire that the curvaton decays before dark matter decouples from the primordial\nplasma. In other words, if dark matter decouples at the temperature TDM , then\n\u0393 & HDM . For illustrative purposes, let us write \u0393 = g 2 m with g \u226a 1, where g is\nsome coupling constant, and assume TDM \u223c O(10) GeV, as would be appropriate for\nLSP dark matter. Then we should require\n2\n\u0393 & O(10)TDM\n\u223c 10\u221233 \u223c 10\u221215 GeV,\n\n(2.3)\n\nor g & 10\u22129 (TeV/m)1/2 . In what follows, we will consider curvaton masses within\nthe range m = 104 . . . 1012 GeV, so that for us the limit on the coupling constant g\nvaries between g & 10\u221214 . . . 10\u221210 , which from a particle physics point of view does\nnot seem to be excessively restrictive.\nAlthough the initial value for the curvaton, and hence r\u2217 , is a free parameter\nconstrained in our case by\nr\u2217 \u226a 1\none can obtain an estimate of its likely value based on a stochastic argument [15].\nConsider the curvaton rolling down its potential during inflation. The comoving\nhorizon shrinks and all the curvaton modes for which k & aH appear as stochastic\nnoise in the dynamics, thus creating stochastic perturbations on scales k < aH as\ntime passes. Note that, unlike for the inflaton in eternal inflation, for the curvaton\nthere are no quantum \"kicks\" that would keep it indefinitely in the quantum regime;\nthis is so because during inflation the background is fixed by the inflaton to be\napproximately deSitter and is almost independent of the subdominant curvaton. The\none-point probability distribution P [\u03c3(~x), t] for the curvaton obeys a Fokker-Planck\nequation\n\u2202P\n1 \u2202\nH 3 \u22022P\n=\n(V\u03c3 P ) + 2 2\n(2.4)\n\u2202t\n3H \u2202\u03c3\n8\u03c0 \u2202\u03c3\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fThe first term on the rhs arises from the classical dynamics while the second represents the quantum noise. Here, by \u03c3(~x) we mean the curvaton smoothed on scales\nlarger than the horizon and ~x denotes the position of one such superhorizon patch.\nAt some point the comoving horizon will equal our observable universe and after\nthat all the quantum noise of the curvaton will correspond to the perturbations we\nobserve within our horizon. Therefore, the classical background value for the curvaton in our universe will be drawn by the solution to (2.4) at the time of horizon\ncrossing for our observable universe. Of course this will depend on the initial condition for the curvaton at the beginning of inflation, but, assuming that inflation lasts\nlong enough, it is natural to consider the equilibrium solution of (2.4). Thus, we\nhave for the initial curvaton value \u03c3\u2217\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n8\u03c0 2\nPequil =\n(2.5)\nexp \u2212 4 V (\u03c3\u2217 )\nN\n3H\u2217\nwhere H\u2217 is the value of the expansion rate when our universe crosses the horizon.\nAs a consequence, the characteristic initial value for the curvaton is given by the\ncondition\nV (\u03c3) \u223c H 4/8\u03c0 2\n(2.6)\n\nwhich is different from simply equating the classical force with the quantum fluctuations V \u2032 \u223c H 3 [12]. Thus during inflation the subdominant curvaton has a probability\ndistribution that is fairly flat. In Sect. 3, where we present our numerical results, this\nwill not be considered as an additional constraint although we display the limiting\nvalue (2.6) in the Figures.\nGiven these constraints, for each point in the parameter space and for each\nset of initial field values, we may then follow the evolution of the field and the\nexpansion rate to compute the amplitude of the perturbation at the time when the\ncurvaton finally decays. We use of the \u2206N-formalism [16, 17, 18], where instead\nof following the evolution of background fields and perturbations around them, the\nevolution of superhorizon fluctuations is described by considering an ensemble of\nhomogenous patches of universe with slightly different initial conditions. We compare\nthe evolution of two such copies: one has the initial field value \u03c3\u2217 , while the other\nhas\n\u03c3+ = \u03c3\u2217 + \u03b4\u03c3\u2217 ,\n(2.7)\nwhere \u03b4\u03c3\u2217 = H\u2217 /2\u03c0. Since we are interested in the curvature perturbation on constant energy density hypersurfaces, these two patches should then be evolved to a\nfixed value of H, chosen so that for that value the curvaton has to a high accuracy decayed completely in both patches. At this point the amount of e-foldings in\nboth patches is compared, and the difference, \u2206N, gives the amplitude of curvature\nperturbation \u03b6,\n1\n\u03b6 \u2261 \u2206N = N(\u03c3+ ) \u2212 N(\u03c3\u2217 ) = \u2206ln a = (ln a)\u2032 \u03b4\u03c3\u2217 + (ln a)\u2032\u2032 \u03b4\u03c3\u22172 + . . . . (2.8)\n2\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fAfter the curvaton decay, the universe evolves adiabatically and the curvature perturbation therefore remains constant \u03b6\u0307 = 0 on superhorizon scales. The amplitude of\nlarge scale primordial perturbations is fixed by CMB observations to be \u03b6 \u2243 4.8\u00d710\u22125\n[19, 20].\n2.2 Qualitative features of evolution\nSolving the full equations of motion analytically for arbitrary n is not possible, although for the special case n = 0 some useful analytical approximations can be\nderived, as will be discussed in Sect. 4.1. Therefore, we will analyze the dynamics\nnumerically. We tackle the full numerics in Sect. 3, but let us first give a qualitative\ndescription of the dynamics using na\u0131\u0308ve analytical estimates. The starting point here\nis the observation [21] that for a scalar field \u03c3 oscillating in a monomial potential\nV \u223c \u03c3 n+4 with n < 6, the average energy density obeys the scaling law\nn+4\n\n\u03c1\u03c3 \u221d a\u22126 n+6 .\n\n(2.9)\n\nLet us therefore consider the limit where either the quadratic term or the interaction\nterm \u03c3 n+4 dominates the potential (1.1). We find that there are three distinctive\nphases in the evolution of the curvaton.\nFirst, right after reheating, the curvaton is still effectively massless with V \u2032\u2032 \u226a\nH 2 and the field value decreases very slowly. Once V \u2032\u2032 \u223c H 2 , the curvaton becomes\nmassive and starts to oscillate around the minimum of its potential. If the interaction\nterm dominates at this stage, the oscillations begin in the \u03c3 n+4 part of the potential\nand the curvaton energy density scales as given by Eq. (2.9). These oscillations\ncontinue, until 12 m2 \u03c3 2 \u223c \u03bb\u03c3 n+4 , where \u03c3 is the envelope of the oscillation. This\nmarks the transition into curvaton oscillations in the quadratic part of the potential,\nwhence the energy density scales as\n\u03c1\u03c3 \u221d a\u22123 .\n\n(2.10)\n\nThese three phases are clearly seen Fig. 1, which for a single choice of parameters\ndisplays the full numerical solution of evolution of r = \u03c1\u03c3 /\u03c1r , and then the piecewise\nscaling-law approximation, where we assume that when a single term dominates the\npotential, it scales according to Eq. (2.9) until H \u223c \u0393, and the curvaton decays\ninstantaneously.\nThe more subdominant the curvaton is during its decay, the less efficiently the\ninitial perturbation in the curvaton field is transmitted to metric fluctuations. However, since the curvaton is very subdominant during inflation, i.e. its field value is\nsmall, the quantum fluctuations produce relatively large perturbations when compared to the field value. Since the perturbation itself can be large, the curvaton does\nnot need to be dominant at the decay. Instead, it is sufficient that its relative density\ngrows enough from the given initial value. How much is \"enough\" will be discussed\nin detail in Sect. 3.\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\f-9\n\n-9\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-11\n\n10\n\nquadratic\nregime\n\n-12\n\n10\n\n-11\n\n10\n\n-12\n\n10\n\nr\n\nr\n\nnon-quadratic\nregime\n\n-10\n\n-10\n\n10\n\n-13\n\n10\n\n-14\n\n10\n\n-15\n\n10\n\n-13\n\n10\n\n-14\n\n10\n\n-15\n\n10\n\n-16\n\n10\n\n\u03c3 = const\n\n-16\n\n8\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n12\n\n10\n\n14\n\n10\n\n16\n\n10\n\n18\n\n10\n\n20\n\n10\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\nt\n\n10\n\n10\n\n12\n\n10\n\n14\n\n10\n\n16\n\n10\n\n18\n\n10\n\n20\n\n10\n\nt\n\n(a) Exact evolution.\n\n(b) Piecewise scaling-law approximation.\n\nFigure 1: Comparison between the exact evolution and scaling-law approximation of the\nrelative curvaton energy density. Here the parameters have been chosen to be n = 2,\nm = 10\u221213 and \u0393 = 10\u221220 , and the inital conditions r\u2217 = 10\u221216 and H\u2217 = 10\u22127 . The three\ndifferent phases of curvaton evolution can be clearly seen: First the energy density stays\nconstant and hence r \u221d a4 , then it starts to oscillate in the non-quadratic part and hence\nr \u221d a\u22121/2 until it enters the regime of quadratic oscillations where r \u221d a. Decay occurs\nwhen \u0393 = H.\n\n2.3 Breakdown of the scaling law and oscillation of the curvature perturbation\nFrom the qualitative discussion above, one would infer that the curvature perturbation varies smoothly and monotonously as the parameter values are changed. However, this is not quite true as the na\u0131\u0308ve use of the scaling law (2.9) does not capture\nall the relevant dynamical details.\nWhen using the scaling law (2.9), one assumes the validity of two approximations:\nfirst, that a single term in the potential dominates completely; and second, that the\noscillations are rapid when compared to the Hubble time H \u22121 . Neither of these\nassumptions is necessarily valid. The presence of two different terms in the potential\n(1.1) could be taken into account by generalizing the scaling law (2.9) following the\nmethods outlined in [21]. This would not affect significantly the qualitative features\nof the results. The breakdown of the latter assumption of rapid oscillations can\nhowever have more significant effects. These can be seen in the numerical solutions\nof the equations of motion which exhibit complicated behaviour not qualitatively\npresent in the simplified analytical approximation. To demonstrate this, in Fig. 2\nwe plot \u2206N as a function of H for fixed values of H\u2217 , r\u2217 and \u0393 for two different\ncurvaton mass values. For different masses the moment of transition from the nonrenormalizable part of the potential to the quadratic part of the potential is different,\nand this affects strongly the final value of \u2206N which is dictated by the duration of\noscillations in the non-quadratic regime.\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\f10-9\n10-10\n\n\u2206N\n\n10-11\n10-12\n10-13\n\nm=5e-11\nm=1e-11\n\n10-14\n10-15\n\n10-18\n\n10-16\n\n10-14\n\nH\n\n10-12\n\n10-10\n\n10-8\n\nFigure 2: \u2206N as a function of H, (time evolves from right to left). Both curves have\nH\u2217 = 10\u22126 , n = 4, \u0393 = 10\u221218 and r\u2217 = 10\u221210 , but masses are for the lower one m = 10\u221211\nand for the upper one 5*10\u221211 . Here we demonstrate the non-trivial evolution of \u2206N . Deep\nin the quadratic regime its oscillations become faster and faster so that \u2206N 's evolution\nis given by a scaling law. However, before the quadratic term in the potential starts to\ndominate, \u2206N shows very complicated oscillatory behaviour.\n\nFrom Fig. 2 it is clear that as the field value oscillates in time, so does \u2206N. In the\nnon-quadratic regime \u2206N oscillates with a large amplitude. If the transition to the\nquadratic regime is slow compared to the oscillations in the non-quadratic regime, the\ntransition averages over several oscillations. As a consequence, the final value of \u2206N\nwill be a non-oscillatory function of the model parameters. However, if the oscillation\nfrequency in the non-quadratic potential is slow, and the transition to the quadratic\noscillations is rapid, then the phase of the non-quadratic oscillation affects the final\nvalue of \u2206N. If the parameters happen to be such that the transition to the quadratic\nregime occurs at a maximum of the oscillation, a relatively high value of \u2206N freezes\nout. Similarly, if the transition occurs at a minimum of the oscillation cycle, the\nfinal value of \u2206N will be much smaller. If the parameters governing the moment of\ntransition, such as the curvaton mass m, are changed continuously, then the phase of\nthe non-quadratic oscillation during the transition also changes continuously. In the\nspace of the parameters this results in an oscillatory pattern in \u2206N. This behaviour\ncan be understood by observing that the curvaton energy density at the beginning of\noscillations can not be expressed in terms of an amplitude of the envelope alone but\nalso depends on the phase of the oscillation, or equivalently on both the field \u03c3 and\nits time derivative \u03c3\u0307, in a non-trivial way. In effect, these act as two independent\ndynamical degrees of freedom. If the transition from the interaction dominated part\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fto the quadratic region takes place at this stage, the initial variation of the curvaton\nvalue \u03c3\u2217 can therefore translate in a non-trivial fashion into the final value of the\ncurvature perturbation.\nIn [12] it was shown that for a potential V \u223c \u03c3 n+4 no oscillatory solutions exist if\nn \u2265 6. This means that in the non-quadratic regime the curvaton merely decays and\nhence no oscillations in \u2206N occur. This is consistent with the qualitative explanation\nof the oscillations discussed above.\n\n3. Numerical solutions\n3.1 Solving the equations of motion\nWe have explored the parameter space numerically for subdominant curvaton models\nthat produce the curvature perturbation \u03b6 \u2243 10\u22125 using the \u2206N formalism with the\npatches defined as in Eq. (2.7).\nThe solution of the full equations of motion (2.1) oscillates more and more rapidly\nas it enters the regime dominated by the quadratic term in the potential. As each\noscillation cycle requires several steps, solving the full equations of motion becomes\nincreasingly slow as the rate of oscillations increase. To resolve this problem, we use\nthe fact that deep in the quadratic regime the oscillations are very fast and hence the\nscaling law approximation Eq. (2.9) becomes very good. Formally this corresponds\nto taking h\u03c3\u0307 2 i = \u03c1\u03c3 . Then we may switch from numerically evolving the equations\nof motion (2.1) to solving the energy density evolution equations\n\u03c1 \u0307\u03c3 = \u2212 (3H + \u0393) \u03c1\u03c3\n\u03c1 \u0307r = \u22124H\u03c1r + \u0393\u03c1\u03c3\n3H 2 = \u03c1r + \u03c1\u03c3\n\n.\n\n(3.1)\n\nSince the solution of these equations does not have oscillatory behaviour, the step\nsize can be increased significantly without sacrificing accuracy. Thus we choose to\nevolve the full system until the quadratic term dominates the non-quadratic term\nby a very large factor, e.g. 105 for n > 2. This value is chosen for convenience only\nand ideally should be as large as possible. This is the point where the numerical\nintegration of the equations of motion becomes intolerably slow, and the smaller n\nin Eq. (1.1) is, the slower the numerics becomes. With n = 0, the system should\nbe followed through a very large number of oscillation cycles. Thus for n = 0 we\nhave to stop intregration already when the quadratic-to-non-quadratic ratio is 102\nto prevent the time of integration to grow to several minutes.\nAt this point, we switch to the evolution equations for the energy densities (3.1)\nand follow the system until the curvaton has decayed, i.e. radiation dominates the\nenergy density of the curvaton by a very large factor, which we fix to be 1080 . At\nthis point we may compute the final value of \u2206N.\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\f\u221214\n\n0\n\u22120.5\n\n\u221210\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\u22120.5\n\n\u221216\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\u221218\n\n\u22121.5\n\u22122\n\n\u221215\n\n10\n\n10\n\n\u22121.5\n\n\u221220\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n\u22122.5\n\n\u22122.5\n\u221222\n\n10\n\n\u22123\n\u221210\n\n10\n\n\u22128\n\n10\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22123.5\n\n10\n\n\u22123\n\u221210\n\n10\n\n(a) n = 0, m = 10\u22128\n\n\u22128\n\n10\n\n\u22126\n\n10\n\n(b) n = 0, m = 10\u221210\n\nFigure 3: log10 rdecay as a function of H\u2217 (horizontal axis) and r\u2217 (vertical axis) for n = 0.\nThe results are shown for a choice of coupling constant \u03bb = 10\u22127 . The white regions correspond to parameter values for which the amplitude of the curvature perturbation exceeds\nthe observed value of \u03b6 \u223c 10\u22125 , and are therefore immediately excluded.

Below the\ndotted line non-quadratic terms in the potential are dynamically insignificant.\n\nWe are interested in how subdominant the curvaton is when it decays. This\nsubdominance is described by the ratio of curvaton-to-radiation densities at the onset\nof decay, defined as\nrdecay = r(\u0393 \u2243 H) .\n(3.2)\nSince the value of rdecay is not an explicit parameter in the model, we calculate it\nby first solving the value for \u0393 which gives the final amplitude of the perturbations\nto be the observed magnitude, 10\u22125 . rdecay is then calculated with these parameters.\nHence the result of the numerical simulations is a value for rdecay and \u0393 for each\nparameter set {n, m, \u03bb, H\u2217, r\u2217 }.\n3.2 Perturbation amplitude in parameter space\nIn Figs. 3 - 6 we have plotted log10 rdecay with different choices of n and m as a function\nof H\u2217 and r\u2217 .

The white color indicates that no matter how dominant the curvaton is,\nit cannot produce the observed amplitude of perturbations. The dominant curvaton\nscenario corresponds to the border between dark red and white, i.e. rdecay = 1. The\nnumerical results demonstrate several features predicted by the simplified qualitative\ndescription discussed in sections 2.2 and 2.3.\nThe decay time is constrained from below by the requirement of no isocurvature\nperturbations, as discussed in Sect. 2.1.

Likewise, as there are no field oscillations in the n = 6 potential, there are no ensuing\noscillations of rdecay in the parameter space, as can be seen in Fig. 6. Furthermore,\nbelow the dotted line the value of rdecay depends only on r\u2217 and not on H\u2217 .

However, one should note that a very\nsubdominant curvaton usually implies a large inflationary scale, as is also evident\nin the figures. This might not be a problem but as the inflationary scale grows\nthe curvature perturbations generated during inflation also grow and can become\nsignificant [2] which needs to be taken into account in the analysis.

To some extent,\nthe analysis serves as a useful consistency check of our numerical results, but can\nalso be of certain interest of its own as it allows in principle to treat arbitrary values\nof the coupling \u03bb analytically.\nIn a radiation dominated background the equation of motion for a homogeneous\ncurvaton with the potential (4.1) can be written as\nd2 f (a)\n+ c1 f (a)3 + c2 a2 f (a) = 0\nda2\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere a = (t/t\u2217 )1/2 is the scale factor, we have defined f = a\u03c3/\u03c3\u2217 and the star denotes\nthe end of inflation. The constants are defined as c1 = 4\u03bb\u03c3\u22172 /H\u22172 and c2 = m2 /H\u22172 .\nTo identify \u03c3\u2217 with the curvaton value at t\u2217 , we should set the initial condition\n\u03c3(t\u2217 ) = \u03c3\u2217 . However, as the field is light at early times and evolves slowly, we choose\ninstead to formally set the initial conditions \u03c3(t \u2192 0) = \u03c3\u2217 and \u03c3\u0307(t \u2192 0) = 0 in the\nasymptotic past. This corresponds to\nf (a)|a=0 = 0 , f \u2032 (a)|a=0 = 1 ,\nand yields \u03c3(t\u2217 ) = \u03c3\u2217 (1 \u2212 O(c1 )) \u2243 \u03c3\u2217 , assuming c1 > c2 .\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n(4.3)\n\n\fExact solutions for Eq.

Neglecting the non-gravitational\ninteractions between the curvaton and the dominant radiation component, the total\nenergy density reads\n\u03c1 = \u03c1r\u2217 a\u22124 + \u03c1\u03c3 ,\n(4.12)\nwhere \u03c1r\u2217 \u2243 3H\u22172 is the radiation energy density at the initial time t\u2217 .\nThe curvature perturbation (2.8) at some time t can be straightforwardly computed by varying (4.12) with respect to the initial curvaton value \u03c3\u2217 and keeping the\nfinal energy density \u03c1 at t fixed.

In the sudden decay approximation,\nthe curvaton is assumed to decay instantaneously at the time H = \u0393 where, up to\nfactors of unity, \u0393 is given by the model dependent perturbative curvaton decay rate.\nThe final value of the curvature perturbation under this assumption is obtained by\nsetting H = \u0393 in (4.13). Here we assume that the universe evolves adiabatically after\nthe curvaton decay and hence \u03b6\u0307 = 0.\nIt is also straightforward to derive a formally non-perturbative expression for\nthe curvature perturbation (see also [3]) which can be directly compared with our\nnumerical results. By performing a finite shift \u03c3\u2217 \u2192 \u03c3\u2217 + \u2206\u03c3\u2217 in (4.12) but keeping\nthe energy density \u03c1 fixed, we arrive at a fourth order equation for the curvature\nperturbation \u03b6 = ln (a + \u2206a) \u2212 ln a\n(1 + r(\u03c3\u2217 )) e4\u03b6 \u2212\n\n2\nr(\u03c3\u2217 )\u03c3osc\n(\u03c3\u2217 + \u2206\u03c3\u2217 ) \u03b6\ne \u22121 =0 .\n2\n\u03c3osc (\u03c3\u2217 )\n\n(4.16)\n\n4.4 Comparing with numerical estimates\nEquation (4.16 ) can be readily solved using standard methods. Qualitative features\nof the solutions are illustrated in Fig. 11 below, which shows \u03b6(\u03c3\u2217 ) for three different\nchoices of the coupling \u03bb together with the corresponding numerical results. First,\nwe can observe that the agreement between analytical and numerical results is very\ngood, even surprisingly so. The mismatch seen for small field values occurs where\nthe dynamics is dominated by the quadratic potential c \u226a 1 and the choice of initial\nconditions for our analytical computation is no longer valid, as discussed above. In\nthis regime, we expect an error proportional to b \u223c 1.2 which seems to be well in\nline with the behaviour seen in Fig. 11. The bump around \u03c3\u2217 \u223c 10\u22126 marks the\nregime where the quadratic and quartic terms are roughly equal initially, c \u223c 1, and\nthe transition from quartic to quadratic potential takes place soon after the onset of\noscillations. For larger field values, oscillations in the quartic potential last for some\nwhile and the result can be understood using the simple scaling law (2.9). These\nfeatures are generic although discussed here using the specific choice of parameters\nin Fig. 11 as an example.\nUnlike for the non-renormalizable potentials, we do not detect any oscillatory\nbehaviour of \u03b6 in the regime c \u223c 1 but instead only the bump. Indeed, using (4.16)\nwe have checked that the first derivative of \u03b6 with respect to \u03c3\u2217 is a positive definite\nfunction in the limit r \u226a 1 and non-monotonous features will show up only in third\nand higher order derivatives. This differs qualitatively from the non-renormalizable\ncase where \u03b6 oscillates as a function of \u03c3\u2217 and consequently even \u03b6 \u2032 must change\nsign. Although we do not have an analytical estimate valid for non-renormalizable\n\n\u2013 19 \u2013\n\n\f\u2206N\n\n10-5\n\n10-6\n\n10-7\n\n\u03c3*\n\n10-6\n\n10-5\n\nFigure 11: The curvature perturbation \u03b6 for a choice of parameters n = 0, m = 10\u22129 ,\nH\u2217 = 10\u22127 and \u0393 = 10\u221228 . The coupling values are \u03bb = 10\u22127 , \u03bb = 2\u00d710\u22127 and \u03bb = 4\u00d710\u22127\nfor red, green and blue curves respectively. The solid lines show numerical results and\ndashed lines analytical estimates.\n\npotentials, this agrees with general qualitative expectations as the transition into\nthe quadratic regime takes place earlier due to the more rapid decrease of the field\namplitude and is therefore more prone to leave an imprint on the perturbation.\nFinally, using (4.13) we can express the amplitude of Gaussian perturbations\nand the non-linearity parameter fNL = 5/6(ln a)\u2032\u2032 /(ln a)\u20322 to leading order in r and\nup to numerical factors in the form\n\u03b6 \u223c \u03c3\u2217\n\n\u0010 m \u00111/2\n\u0393\n\n\u03b4\u03c3\u2217 \u00d7 f1 (c) , fNL\n\n1\n\u223c 2\n\u03c3\u2217\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0393\nm\n\n\u00131/2\n\n\u00d7 f2 (c) ,\n\n(4.17)\n\nwhich coincide with the well known quadratic results [4] apart from the functions\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032 2\nf1 = \u03c3osc \u03c3osc\n/\u03c3\u2217 and f2 = (\u03c3\u2217 /\u03c3osc )2 (1 + \u03c3osc \u03c3osc\n/\u03c3osc\n). These depend only on the\ndimensionless parameter c and their behaviour is depicted in Fig. 4.4. It can be seen\nthat the inclusion of a quartic term in the potential tends to decrease the perturbation\namplitude and enhance the non-Gaussian effects, except for the slight decrease1 of\nfNL observed around c \u223c 1. However, deviations from quadratic results are rather\nsmall as long as the quartic term is not vastly dominant over the quadratic part\n1\n\nNote that this differs from the result of [9] based on a perturbative analysis. For n > 0, however,\nthe sign change of fNL found in [9] is consistent with the oscillations of \u2206N found in this paper.\n\n\u2013 20 \u2013\n\n\ff1\n\nf2\n\n1\n10\n0.5\n\n7\n5\n3\n2\n1.5\n\n0.1\n0.05\n\n1\nc\n0.1\n\n0.5 1\n\n5\n\n10\n\nc\n\n50 100\n\n0.1\n\n0.5 1\n\n5\n\n10\n\n50 100\n\n\u221a\nFigure 12: f1 and f2 plotted for different values of c \u223c 2 \u03bb\u03c3\u2217 /m. f1 and f2 , defined in\nEq.

For example, it can be seen from Fig. 4.4 that the quadratic results\nget modified by at most an order of magnitude for c . 10, where c = 10 already\ncorresponds to a clear dominance of the quartic term. In this regime the model\nis therefore compatible with observations under much of the same conditions as a\nquadratic model with the same parameters (\u03c3\u2217 , H\u2217 , m, \u0393), although one also needs to\ntake into account the different consistency constraints coming from the masslessness\nand subdominance of curvaton during inflation. If the interaction becomes more\ndominant, c & 10 or so, Fig. 4.4 implies that the main constraints come from the\nobservational upper bound |fNL | . 100 for the bispectrum [20]. This translates into a\nlower bound for the curvaton subdominance r, which will be more stringent than the\nquadratic result r & 0.01 [4]. These limits from non-gaussianity need to be checked\nmore carefully, and calculated also for the cases n > 0 [23].\n\n5. Conclusions\nWe have studied the evolution of the amplitude of primordial perturbation in a class\nof curvaton models where the potential contains, in addition to the usual quadratic\nterm, either a quartic or some non-renormalizable term. For the calculation of the\nperturbation amplitude, these turn out to be dynamically important for a large\npart of the parameter space. We also focused on the possibility that the curvaton\nenergy density is subdominant at the time of its decay. To some extent, this a\nnatural consequence of non-renormalizable curvaton potential since then the relative\ncurvaton energy density r gets damped after inflation when the field is oscillating in\nthe non-quadratic part of its potential. Depending on the decay time, this stage is\nfollowed by oscillations in a quadratic potential whence r starts to increase again,\nbut typically remains subdominant for realistic decay widths.\nAlthough the amplification of curvaton energy is less efficient than for a quadratic\nmodel, the interacting model may still generate the observed amplitude of primordial\nperturbation since the initial curvaton perturbation \u03b4\u03c3\u2217 /\u03c3\u2217 can be much larger than\n\n\u2013 21 \u2013\n\n\f10\u22125 . This translates into constraints for the model parameters: the decay width \u0393,\nthe inflationary scale H\u2217 , the bare curvaton mass m and its initial energy density\nr\u2217 . In the present paper we have performed a systematic study of the available\nparameter space for different types of non-quadratic potentials. We have shown that\nthe correct amplitude of perturbations can indeed be achieved for large regions of\nthe parameter space even if the interaction term dominates over the quadratic part\nand the curvaton would be subdominant by a factor of r \u223c 10\u22123 or so at the time of\nits decay.\nMoreover, we found that the final relative curvaton energy density rdecay required\nto give rise to the observed amplitude depends on the model parameters in a highly\ncomplicated way and, for non-renormalizable potentials, shows oscillatory behaviour\nwhen the non-quadratic part dominates initially. The same oscillatory features show\nup when considering the curvature perturbation \u03b6 as a function of the curvaton value\n\u03c3\u2217 during inflation. Again, this happens for a large portion of the parameter space.\nWe have traced this non-monotonous parametric dependence to the field dynamics\ntaking place during the transition from the non-quadratic to the quadratic part of\nthe potential. If the transition takes place soon after the beginning of oscillations,\nboth \u03c3 and \u03c3\u0307 act as independent dynamical variables and, consequently, variation\nof the initial conditions can leave a non-trivial imprint on the expansion history. If\nthe non-quadratic term always remains subdominant such features are absent. Also\nfor the renormalizable case n = 0, the transition does not give rise to oscillatory\nbehaviour but nevertheless leaves a clearly distinguishable mark in the results. This\nagrees with the analytical estimates we have derived for this special case.\nSome parts of the parameter space that give rise to an acceptable perturbation\namplitude are likely to be ruled out because they produce large non-Gaussianities.\nThis is expected as we consider the subdominant limit r \u226a 1 where the non-Gaussian\neffect are known to be large already for a quadratic model. However, because of the\nnon-monotonic dependence \u03b6(\u03c3\u2217 ) observed for non-renormalizable potentials, it is\nnot evident what the final non-Gaussianity turns out be in this case. Indeed, when\nconsidering the expansion (2.8) for the curvature perturbation, the non-monotonic\nbehaviour implies that the sign of (ln a)\u2032\u2032 is varying, barring any accidental cancellations. In certain regions of the parameter space we should therefore find a significant\nsuppression for the non-linearity parameter fNL \u223c (ln a)\u2032\u2032 /(ln a)\u20322 measuring the bispectrum amplitude. It is clear though that this qualitative argumentation cannot\nbe pushed much further and a detailed survey of the parameter space is required\nto address the question of non-Gaussianity. This will be the topic of a forthcoming\npaper [23].\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the EU 6th Framework Marie Curie Research and Train-\n\n\u2013 22 \u2013\n\n\fing network \"UniverseNet\" (MRTN-CT-2006-035863) and partly by the Academy of\nFinland grants 114419 (K.E.) and 130265 (S.N.).
