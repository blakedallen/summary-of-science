It turns out that some family of\nfinitely-additive probabilities is the statistical regularity of any such\nphenomenon. If the mass phenomenon is stochastic, then this family\ndegenerates into a single probability measure. The paper provides definitions, the formulation and the proof of the theorem of existence of\nstatistical regularities, as well as the examples of their application.\nKey words Sequence, Net, Nonstochastic randomness, Statistical regularity, Families of probability distributions\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe interest in studying the properties of mass random phenomena (MRP)\nis not new. So in [3, 4] the authors pointed out the difficulties arising in the\nprocess of modeling of the social MRP. In particular, in [4] one reads:\"Some\ncontemporary theoreticians ... think that probability could be defined as\nfrequency for a very large number of trials. If for a very big number of trials\nthis frequency does not tend to a limit, but fluctuates more or less between\ndifferent limits, one needs to affirm that probability p does not remain constant and changes in the process of trials. This concerns, for example, human\nmortality rate in the course of centuries, since the progress of medicine and\nhygiene leads to the increase of life duration.\" The problem of revealing of\n\u2217\n\nvictor.ivanenko.1@gmail.com\nDepartment of mathematical modeling of economical systems, Kyiv Polytechnical\nInstitute, 57, Prospekt Peremogy, Kyiv 03056, Ukraine,\n\u2020\n\n1\n\n\fthe regularities of MRP becomes more and more important, especially in\nrelation to the instability of financial markets and other economic objects\n[24, 25, 29], that makes forecasting in this area very unreliable.\nIn [5] the question was risen whether the MRP posses the properties that\nare necessary in order to apply the probability theory to their description?\nIn [1] we find the following remark by A.N. Kolmogorov: \"Speaking of\nrandomness in the ordinary sense of this word, we mean those phenomena\nin which we do not find regularities allowing us to predict their behavior.\nGenerally speaking, there are no reasons to assume that random in this\nsense phenomena are subject to some probabilistic laws. Hence, it is necessary to distinguish between randomness in this broad sense and stochastic\nrandomness (which is the subject of probability theory)\".\nHowever, what do the words \"do not find regularities allowing us to\npredict their behavior\" mean? Hardly these words should be understood in\nthe sense that such regularities do not exist at all. More likely, these words\npoint out to the problem of finding statistical regularities of mass random\nin a broad sens phenomena (MRBSP), that is the regularities of asymptotic\nbehavior of different average values that characterize these phenomena. It\ncan be frequencies of hitting in given subsets, arithmetic averages of some\nfunctionals, and so on. Recall that MRP are called statistically stable or\nstochastic, if with the increase of the number of \"trials\" all these averages\ntend to limits (and if some other conditions are verified as well, see details\nin [1]). Unlike this, it is natural to consider as MRBSP those MRP, whose\nbehavior interests us only to within their statistical regularities. In other\nwords, this definition combines in MRBSP stochastic as well as nonstochastic\nrandom phenomena.\n\n1\n\nThe theorem of existence of statistical regularities of these phenomena\nin the form of families of probability distributions, and their significance to\ndecision theory, constitute the content of this paper.\n1\nThe term \"nonstochastic\" appeared in [11] in the context of Kolmogorov's complexity,\nmeaning \"more complex than stochastic\". In this paper the meaning of this term is \"more\nrandom than stochastic\".\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nTheorem of existence of statistical\nregularities\n\nAn ordinary sequence is the simplest mathematical model of a mass phenomenon. In order to construct, on the basis of a sequence, a model of a\nrandom phenomenon, it is necessary to identify sequences that have identical\nstatistical properties.\nDefinition 1. Let X be an arbitrary set. Two sequences x(1) and x(2) of\nelements of the set X are called statistically equivalent (S-equivalent) if and\nonly if for any natural number m and any bounded mapping \u03b3 \u2208 (X \u2192 Rm )\nthe set of limit points of the sequence\nn\n\ny (k)\nn ;n\n\n\u2208N\n\no\n\nn\n\n, y (k)\nn\n\n1X\n(k)\n\u03b3(xi )\n=\nn\ni=1\n\ndoes not depend on k \u2208 {1, 2}.\nThe class of S-equivalence of the sequence x \u2208 X N will be denoted\nas S(x). Our nearest goal is to find the invariant of the relation of Sequivalence. Introduce several notions.\nLet M be a Banach space of bounded real functions, defined on the set\nX, M \u2217 be the dual space of the space M , and \u03c4 - is a weak-\u2217 topology in\nM \u2217 . Let, further, P F (X) be the subspace of the topological space (M \u2217 , \u03c4 )\ndefined by the formula\nP F (X) = {p \u2208 M \u2217 : p(f ) \u2265 0 if f \u2265 0, p(1X ) = 1} ,\nwhere 1A (*) is the characteristic function of the set A.2\nAssociate to an arbitrary sequence x = {xn ; n \u2208 N} \u2208 X N the sequence\n2\n\nIn what follows, instead of p(1A ) we shall often write p(A), identifying, by the same\ntoken, the elements of the set P F (X) with the finitely additive and\nR normed measures\non 2X . Obviously, p(f ) in this case is simply the integral p(f ) = f (x)p(dx), defined\nnaturally due to boundedness of function f .\n\n3\n\n\fof elements from P F (X) defined as\nn\n\nn\no\n1X\n(n)\n(n)\n1A (xi ), \u2200A \u2286 X.\npx (*); n \u2208 N , px (A) =\nn\ni=1\n\n(n)\n\nNote that the elements px (A) from P F (X) has the meaning of\nfrequencies of hitting of the elements of x in the set A.3 Due to\n\u2217\ncompactness\nn of the spaceoP F (X) (as of a bounded closed set in (M , \u03c4 )), the\n(n)\nsequence px (*); n \u2208 N will have a non-empty closed set of limit points,\n\nwhich we denote as Px and call the regularity of this sequence. Therefore\n\nintroduce the following definition.\nDefinition 2. Any non-empty closed subset of the space P F (X) is called\na regularity on X. Denote the set of all regularities on X as P(X) and\nassociate to any sequence x \u2208 X N its regularity Px . Finally, for m \u2208 N,\n\u03b3 = (\u03b31 , \u03b32 , . . . , \u03b3m ) \u2208 (X \u2192 Rm ) and P \u2208 P(X), the symbol P (\u03b3) denotes\nthe set\n\b\n\n(r1 , r2 , . . . , rm ) \u2208 Rm : \u2203p \u2208 P, ri = p(\u03b3i ), \u2200i \u2208 1, m ,\n\nand, in particular, p(\u03b3) = (p(\u03b31 ), p(\u03b32 ), . . . , p(\u03b3m )) for p \u2208 P F (X).\nConsider the following proposition.\nProposition 1. The mapping x 7\u2192 Px is the invariant of the relation of\nS-equivalence on X N .\nThis statement will be proved below in a more general form. So far,\nhowever, let us agree to call the classes of S-equivalence of sequences the\nsimplest random phenomena, and their regularities - statistical regularities\nof the corresponding phenomena. Any sequence x \u2208 X N is considered as a\nrealization of a simplest random phenomenon S(x).\nConnection of the notions introduced above with the probabilistic notions follows directly from the enforced law of large numbers.\n3\n\nSee also [6, 2]\n\n4\n\n\fProposition 2. Let X be a finite set, \u03bc - a probability distribution on X,\n\b\nand \u03be = \u03be n ; n \u2208 N - a sequence of independent (in the usual sense) random\n\nelements, taking values in X with distribution \u03bc. Then with probability 1\nthe sequence x of the values of the sequence \u03be will be a realization of the\n\nsimplest random phenomenon S(x) with statistical regularity Px = {\u03bc}, i.e.\nconsisting of the single distribution \u03bc.\nHowever, when the set X is infinite everything becomes considerably\nmore difficult. In this case, the capabilities of sequences, generally speaking,\nare insufficient in order to guarantee that the frequencies of hitting in all\nmeasurable sets would tend to their limits simultaneously. Moreover, it is\neasy to see that the regularities of sequences, since they are concentrated\nonly on a countable subset of the set X, constitute only a small part of the\nset of all regularities on X. This seems to reflect the fact that sequences\nconstitute only a small part of all mass phenomena. A more general notion\nof sampling net is, as we shall see further, already sufficient for our goals.\nDefinition 3. A sampling net (s.n.) in X is any net \u03c6 = {\u03c6\u03bb , \u03bb \u2208 \u039b, \u2265}\ntaking values in the sampling space\nX\n\n\u221e\n\n=\n\n\u221e\n[\n\nn=1\n\nXn, Xn = X\n* * \u00d7 X} .\n| \u00d7 *{z\nn\n\nMoreover, if \u03bb \u2208 \u039b,\u03c6\u03bb \u2208 X n then we denote n = n\u03bb , \u03c6\u03bb = (\u03c6\u03bb1 , \u03c6\u03bb2 , . . . , \u03c6\u03bbn\u03bb )\n(\u03bb)\n\nand associate to this \u03bb the measure p\u03c6 \u2208 P F (X) defined as\n(\u03bb)\np\u03c6\n(A) =\n\nn\u03bb\n1 X\n1A (\u03c6\u03bbi ),\nn\u03bb\n\nA \u2286 X.\n\ni=1\n\n\b\nThe set P\u03c6 of limit points of the net p\u03c6 = p\u03bb\u03c6 , \u03bb \u2208 \u039b, \u2265 will be called the\nregularity of the s.n. \u03c6. The class of all s.n. in X will be denoted as \u03a6(X).\nExtend now the relation of S-equivalence on the whole \u03a6(X).\nDefinition 4. Sampling nets \u03c6(k) \u2208 \u03a6(X),k = 1, 2 are considered as Sequivalent if and only if for any m \u2208 N and any bounded mapping \u03b3 \u2208 (X \u2192\n5\n\n\fRm ) the set of limit points of the net of averages\nn\n\n(k)\ny\u03bb , \u03bb\n\no\n\n\u2208 \u039b, \u2265 ,\n\n(k)\ny\u03bb\n\nn\u03bb\n1 X\n(k)\n=\n\u03b3(\u03c6\u03bbi )\nn\u03bb\n\n(1)\n\ni=1\n\ndoes not depend on k \u2208 {1, 2}.\nWe can now formulate the main theorem in the following way.\nTheorem 1.\n\n(i) For any s.n. \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6(X), any m \u2208 N and any bounded\n\nmapping \u03b3 \u2208 (X \u2192 Rm ), the set of limit points of the net (1) can be\nwritten as P\u03c6 (\u03b3).\n(ii) The mapping \u03c6 7\u2192 P\u03c6 , defined on \u03a6(X), is the invariant of the relation\nof S-equivalence.\n(iii) This mapping is a mapping on the whole set P(X), i.e. the set \u03a6(X)/S\nof classes of S-equivalence and the set P(X) of regularities are put by\nthis mapping into one-to-one correspondence.\nThis theorem justifies the following definition.\nDefinition 5. Any class of S-equivalence of sampling nets in X is called\nrandom in a broad sense mass phenomenon in X. The regularity P\u03c6 is\ncalled the statistical regularity of the random phenomenon S(\u03c6). Any s.n.\n\u2032\n\n\u03c6 \u2208 S(\u03c6) is called a realization of the random phenomenon S(\u03c6). The\nrandom phenomenon, having statistical regularity P , is called \u03bc-stochastic\nif and only if there exists a non-trivial \u03c3-algebra A \u2286 2X , on which \u03bc is a\n\u03c3-additive probability, and p(A) = \u03bc(A) for all p \u2208 P, A \u2208 A.\n\n3\n\nThe proof\n\nDenote the set of limit points of an arbitrary net g = {g\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208 A, <} with\nvalues in X as LIM (g) or LIM {g\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208 A, <}. Denote the set of bounded\nmappings from X into Rm as M m . We need to establish the three following\nfacts:\n6\n\n\f(i)\n\nThe relation\nLIM {y\u03bb , \u03bb \u2208 \u039b, <} = P\u03c6 (\u03b3),\nwhere\n\nn\u03bb\n1 X\ny\u03bb =\n\u03b3(\u03c6\u03bbi ),\nn\u03bb\ni=1\n\nis true for all m \u2208 N, \u03b3 \u2208 M m , \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6(X).\n(ii)\n\nIf P1 , P2 \u2208 P(X), P1 6= P2 , then there exist such m \u2208 N and such\n\u03b3 \u2208 M m , that P1 (\u03b3) 6= P2 (\u03b3).\n\n(iii)\n\nFor any regularity P \u2208 P(X) there exist such s.d. \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6(X), that\nP = P\u03c6 .\n\nBegin with the proof of the proposition (i). Let r \u2208 LIM (y), where y =\n{y\u03bb , \u03bb \u2208 \u039b, <}. Then there exists a subnet of the net y converging to r, i.e.\nthere exists (see [8]) a directed set (A, <) and a function f : A \u2192 \u039b such\nthat the net y = y \u25e6 f converges to r, and, in addition, for any \u03bb \u2208 \u039b there\nexists such \u03b11 \u2208 A that f (\u03b1) < \u03bb for all \u03b1 < \u03b11 .\n\nn\no\n(\u03bb)\nConsider now the net of measures p\u03c6 = p\u03c6 \u25e6f , where p\u03c6 = p\u03c6 , \u03bb \u2208 \u039b, < .\n\nBy virtue of compactness of the space (P F (X), \u03c4 ) this net has at least one\nlimit point. Denote it as p0 and consider a subnet p\u03c6 of the net p\u03c6 , con-\n\nverging to p0 . Let it be p\u03c6 = p\u03c6 \u25e6 g = p\u03c6 \u25e6 f \u25e6 g, g : B \u2192 A. Then the\nnet y = y \u25e6 f \u25e6 g, on the one hand, converges to r, and, on the other hand,\n(\u03b2)\n\ny \u03b2 = p\u03c6 (\u03b3), \u03b2 \u2208 B, so that\n(\u03b2)\n\nr = lim p\u03c6 (\u03b3) = p0 (\u03b3) \u2208 P\u03c6 (\u03b3).\n\u03b2\n\nBy the same token, it is proved that LIM (y) \u2286 P\u03c6 (\u03b3).\nConversely, if p0 \u2208 P\u03c6 , r = p0 (\u03b3), then there exists a subnet pe\u03c6 =\n\b \u03b1\n(\u03b1)\npe\u03c6 , \u03b1 \u2208 A, < of the net p\u03c6 , converging to p0 . But in this case lim\u03b1 pe\u03c6 (\u03b3i ) =\n(\u03b1)\n\np0 (\u03b3i ) for all i \u2208 1, m. It means that lim\u03b1 pe\u03c6 (\u03b3) = p0 (\u03b3). And, since\n(\u03b1)\n\npe\u03c6 (\u03b3) = y\u03bb for \u03bb = f (\u03b1), this proves (i).\n\nIn order to prove (ii) assume that there exists p1 \u2208 P1 \\ P2 . Since the\n\nset P2 is closed, there exists a vicinity of the point p1 that does not cross\n7\n\n\fwith P2 and it means that there exist such \u01eb > 0, \u03b31 , \u03b32 , . . . , \u03b3m \u2208 M that\n\u2200p2 \u2208 P2 , \u2203i \u2208 1, m, |p1 (\u03b3i ) \u2212 p2 (\u03b3i )| > \u01eb.\nSo that if \u03b3 = (\u03b31 , \u03b32 , . . . , \u03b3m ), then p1 (\u03b3) \u2208\n/ P2 (\u03b3).\nThe complete proof of (iii) can be found in [18, 23, 27]. Here we shall\noutline the main ideas of the proof. Let Q be the set of all such measures\nq \u2208 P F (X) that each one of them is concentrated on a finite set Xq \u2286 X,\nand in addition all numbers q(x), x \u2208 Xq are rational. One can show that\nthe set Q is everywhere dense in (P F (X), \u03c4 ).\nNow, to an arbitrary regularity P \u2208 P(X) we put into correspondence\nthe directed set (\u039b, <) such that\n\u039b = R+ \u00d7 M \u221e \u00d7 P, R+ =]0, \u221e[, M \u221e =\n\n\u221e\n[\n\nm=1\n\nM m, M m = M\n* * \u00d7 M}\n| \u00d7 *{z\nm\n\nand the relation (<) is given by the formula\n(\u01eb1 , \u03b311 , \u03b312 , . . . , \u03b31n1 , p1 ) < (\u01eb2 , \u03b321 , \u03b322 , . . . , \u03b32n2 , p2 ) \u21d4\n(\u01eb1 \u2264 \u01eb2 , {\u03b311 , \u03b312 , . . . , \u03b31n1 } \u2287 {\u03b321 , \u03b322 , . . . , \u03b32n2 }),\nwhere no condition is imposed on p1 and p2 .\nFinally, to any \u03bb = (\u01eb, \u03b31 , \u03b32 , . . . , \u03b3m , p) \u2208 \u039b we put into correspondence\nsome\nq\u03bb \u2208 Q\n\n\\n\n\no\n\u2032\n\u2032\np \u2208 P F (X) : \u2200i \u2208 1, m, p(\u03b3i ) \u2212 p (\u03b3i ) < \u01eb .\n\nIt is proven further that with any \u03bb \u2208 \u039b one can associate simultaneously\n(\u03bb)\n\n(\u03bb)\n\n(\u03bb)\n\na sequence of points x1 , x2 , . . . , xn\u03bb \u2208 Xq satisfying the condition\nn\u03bb\n1 X\n(\u03bb)\n1A (xi ),\nq\u03bb (A) =\nn\u03bb\n\n\u2200A \u2286 X.\n\ni=1\n\n(\u03bb)\n\n(\u03bb)\n\n(\u03bb)\n\nIt remains to chose \u03c6\u03bb = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn\u03bb ) and we obtain a s.n. \u03c6 : \u03bb 7\u2192\n\u03c6\u03bb that has the regularity P\u03c6 = P .\n8\n\n\f4\n\nApplications in decision theory\n\nStatistical regularities of the general form find their application in decision\ntheory [14, 15, 16, 18, 23, 27, 28] and its applications [30].\nConsidering decision problems, assume that we need to make a decision\nu from the set U of possible decisions, knowing that the result of making\na decision depends on some uncontrolled parameter \u03b8 from the set \u0398 of\npossible values of this parameter and is described by the bounded real loss\nfunction L : \u0398 \u00d7 U \u2192 R. If nothing is known about the behavior of the\nparameter, then we cannot, strictly speaking, exclude that scenario, where\nthe value of \u03b8 is chosen in the worst possible for us way. In this case, the\nquality of decision u is evaluated by means of the loss function\nL\u22171 (u) = sup L(\u03b8, u), u \u2208 U,\n\u03b8\u2208\u0398\n\na so called \"minmax\" criterion.\nIf it is known, that parameter \u03b8 is stochastic with the given distribution\n\u03bc, then, trying to minimize the average losses, one makes use of the Bayes\ncriterion\nL\u22172 (u)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nL(\u03b8, u)\u03bc(d\u03b8), u \u2208 U.\n\nSuppose now that parameter \u03b8 is random in a broad sense with the\nstatistical regularity P \u2208 P(\u0398). Let us show that in this case it is natural\nto chose the criterion in the form of\nZ\nL\u22173 (u) = sup L(\u03b8, u)p(d\u03b8), u \u2208 U,\n\n(2)\n\np\u2208P\n\nIndeed, let r1 < L\u22173 (u) < r2 . The following statement is straightforward\nProposition 3. Let {\u03c6\u03bb , \u03bb \u2208 \u039b, <} - be a sampling net in \u0398 with the regularity P . Then for any \u03bb1 \u2208 \u039b there is such \u03bb < \u03bb1 that\nn\u03bb\n1 X\nL(\u03c6\u03bbi , u) > r1\nn\u03bb\ni=1\n\n9\n\n\fand, at the same time, there is such \u03bb2 , that for all \u03bb < \u03bb2 there will be\nn\u03bb\n1 X\nL(\u03c6\u03bbi , u) < r2 .\nn\u03bb\ni=1\n\nIn other words, L\u22173 (u) - is that natural border, that separates the average\nlosses, that can happen for a given u for an arbitrary \"large\" \u03bb, from those\naverage losses that are not \"dangerous\" to us, when \u03bb is sufficiently \"large\".\nIt is easy to see that L\u22173 (u) becomes L\u22171 (u), when P = P F (\u0398) (strictly\nnothing is known about \u03b8, save the set \u0398 where it takes values), and that it\nbecomes L\u22172 (u), when P = \u03bc is stochastic regularity and function L(*, u) is\nmeasurable relatively to the corresponding \u03c3- algebra.\nThe inverse result appears as somewhat surprising. It turns out that if\none subordinates a criterion choice rule to some natural conditions of consistency with the triplet (\u0398, U, L), then any rule, satisfying these conditions,\nleads to the criterion of the form (2), where P - is some (not known beforehand) regularity on \u0398. In particular, this result justifies the heuristic\ndefinition of random in a road sense phenomena introduced above. Therefore, one can conclude that regularity on \u0398 is, in a certain sense, the most\ngeneral form of information about the behavior of \u03b8. One can find details\nin [14, 15, 18, 23, 27].\n\n5\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nToday there are several approaches to modeling of the MRP. So, there is\nthe algorithmic approach to randomness [9, 11] as well as the game-theoretic\napproach to randomness in finance [19]. An alternative approach was studied\nin [10], where sequences were constructed only with the requirement of the\nso called \u0393l - independence. In mathematical finance diverse extensions of\nstochastic models have been popular [20, 21, 22].\nFamilies of probability distributions appear in literature more and more\noften. So, they were considered in game theory [7] in order to study nonadditive set functions. In the so called subjective decision theory these\n\n10\n\n\ffamilies appear as consequence of the axioms of rational choice [14, 15, 16],\nwhere, similarily to robust statistics [12], they were interpreted as families\nof a priori distributions. Families of probability distributions attract all the\nmore attention in statistical data analysis [26]4 .\nIt turns out that specifically families of probability distributions are necessary for the description of statistical (frequentist) regularities of a rather\nwide class of MRBSP. The theorem of existence of such statistical regularities was published earlier in somewhat different form [17, 18].\n\n4\n\nI am thankful to professor Vladimir Vovk who made me familiar with the works of\nprofessor Terrence Fine and, in particular, with this paper.\n\n11\n\n\fReferences\n[1] Kolmogorov A.N.
