The star was first observed by\nP\u00e8re Dom Anthelme and was discovered independently by\n1\n\nOf the eruptive variables, it is predated only by the well-known\nGalactic supernovae and by the LBV eruptions of P Cyg in 1600\nand 1655\n\nHevelius in June/July 1670. The observed eruption lasted\nfor two years, during 1670-1672. It was discovered at 3rd\nmagnitude, and faded over 100 days to below visual limits\n(magnitude 6). The following year it was recovered during\nrebrightening, reaching magnitude 2.6, 300 days after the\nfirst maximum. It again faded on the same time scale of 100\ndays to below observational limits. It showed a faint tertiary\nmaximum 600 days after the first peak, at magnitude 5.5\n(Shara et al. 1985). The star has not been recovered since.\nIts light curve is unlike any catalogued novae, raising doubts\n\n\fHajduk et al.\n\non its status. Interpretations include a hibernating nova, or\na helium flash on a new white dwarf.\nThe historic observations provided coordinates for CK\nVul accurate to within a few arcminutes. Based on the old\ncharts, Shara & Moffat (1982) were successful in searching\nfor the remnant. They discovered several nebulosities on\ntheir H\u03b1+[N ii] image, the spectra of which present reddened\nemissions of [N ii], H ii, [O ii] and [S ii]. On their spectra, the\nflux of [N ii] \u03bb 6584\u00c5 is three times more intense than the\nH\u03b1 line, indicating an evolved, and perhaps hydrogen deficient chemical composition. No obvious exciting star was\nfound in the field of CK Vul. A central star candidate was\nsuggested by Shara et al. (1985), but shown to be misidentified as such by Naylor et al. (1992); the latter authors were\nunable to identify, among the stars visible on their R image, an alternative central star candidate which could be\nresponsible for the ionization of the observed nebulosity.\nThe lack of bright candidates for the central star would\nconstrain the possible companion of the white dwarf in cataclysmic systems, assuming that CK Vul is an ordinary nova.\nHowever, the list of features uncommon for classical novae is\nextensive. The light curve during the outburst of Nova Vul\n1670 is unprecedented, showing variations which resemble\na set of declines and subsequent recoveries. The rebrightenings may indicate constant intrinsic brightness with intermittent dust formation, or a light echo. In the first instance, the object remained at high luminosity for over a\nyear, with the fading(s) caused by intermittent extinction.\nIn the second case, a dense medium needs to be present\nwithin a parsec of the source. The properties of the shell are\nquite unusual: a low outflow velocity of the ejected material,\nlow density and high ionized mass (although the distance\nis very uncertain). Shara et al. (1985) discuss (and reject)\nsome alternative hypotheses concerning the nature of CK\nVul. Harrison (1996) suggests that CK Vul may be a Very\nLate Thermal Pulse event (VLTP) rather than a nova: this\nis based on similarities of the light curve to those seen in\nV605 Aql and V4334 Sgr (Sakurai's Object) (Hajduk et al.\n2005). Evans et al. (2002) have added more arguments for\nthis reborn scenario for CK Vul. If the VLTP scenario for\nCK Vul is correct, it would be only the third object observed during a VLTP. Kato (2003) suggested CK Vul to be\na stellar merger. However, none of the presented scenarios is\nfully convincing: the observational data are limited, but the\nobject seems to be unique.\nIn order to test the VLTP hypothesis we searched for\nevidence of ionized material, since these stars reach high\ntemperatures soon after the eruption and ionize a compact\nshell. In contrast, radio emission from classical novae fades\nwithin a few years after the eruption. To this end we conducted radio observations and also obtained deep images, to\nsearch for the ejecta, and for evidence of a fossil planetary\nnebula.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nOBSERVATIONS\nRadio emission\n\nThe first radio observations of CK Vul were carried out with\nthe VLA array on the 4th of April 2005. The VLA was in the\nso-called 'B' configuration, with a largest baseline of about\n\n0.0014\n\nfitted to data\nbeam\n\n0.0012\n0.001\nmJy/beam\n\n2\n\n0.0008\n0.0006\n0.0004\n0.0002\n0\n-0.0002\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\narc sec\n\nFigure 1. The profile of the radio source, based on the higher\nresolution 8 GHz 2006 observations.\n\n10 km. The observations were done at a frequency of 5 GHz.\nCK Vul was observed for approximately 2 hours, divided\ninto \u223c14-min scans, interspersed with observations of the\nphase calibrator (1922+155). A second set of observations\nwas obtained on April 9, 2006, with the VLA in the 'A'\nconfiguration. After each \u223c10 min scan of CK Vul, at 5 GHz\nand 8 GHz, alternately, the phase calibrator 1922+155 was\nobserved.\n1331+305 was used as the primary flux calibrator for\nboth the 2005 and 2006 observations. Observational parameters are summarized in Table 1.\nThe data were reduced using standard procedures implemented in the AIPS package, by Fourier transforming the\nvisibility data followed by the removal of the dirty beam pattern. The data were convolved with a synthesized gaussian\npoint spread function (beam) of the same FWHM as the\ndirty beam: the beam sizes are listed in Table 1. Low spatial\nresolution images were also created, in order to search for\nconfusing sources: only a few such confusing sources were\nfound at 5 GHz and 8 GHz. Both uniformly and naturally\nweighted images were made, using the CLEAN algorithm.\nThe RMS noise on the maps of CK Vul followed closely the\ntheoretical thermal noise.\nOur 2005 observation reveals radio emission of 1.46 \u00b1\n0.05 mJy (where the uncertainty is taken as the 3-\u03c3 noise on\nthe map). The emission is consistent with a point source: the\nupper limit of the diameter, deconvolved from the beam, is\n0.5 arcsec. But the higher resolution 2006 observations find\nthe object to be resolved. The profile of the source, and that\nof the beam are shown in Fig 1. The FWHM of the beam is\n0.26 \u00d7 0.23 arcsec, the convolved source 0.29 \u00d7 0.26 arcsec,\nand the deconvolved FWHM (gaussian fit) is 0.12 \u00b1 0.01 \u00d7\n0.11 \u00b1 0.01 arcsec. The fitting rules out a point source.\nThe fluxes are listed in Table 1: they were measured\nboth from gaussian fitting and from summing. The slight\ndifference between the two epochs may be due to calibration uncertainties or intrinsic variability. The peak intensity of the 8 GHz emission (natural weighting) is 1.25 \u00b1\n0.02 mJy/beam, lower than the integrated flux. This also\nconfirms that the source is resolved. The source is not circularly polarized, but due to the faintness of the source the\ndetection limit for polarization is only about 20 per cent.\n\n\fStar and nebula of CK Vul\n\n3\n\nTable 1.

IPHAS is a CCD H\u03b1\nimaging survey of the Northern Galactic plane (Drew et al.\n2005). This survey uses 120-sec exposures through the H\u03b1\nfilter, 30 sec through the Sloan r \u2032 and 10 sec through Sloan i\u2032\n(every sky position is covered twice). The deeper service observations used three 600-sec H\u03b1 exposures, supplemented\nby three 90-sec exposures with the Sloan r \u2032 filter. All observations used the wide field camera, which has a 30 arcmin\nfield of view, mapped onto a mosaic of 4 CCDs. The pixel\nsize is 0.3 arcsec.\nThe observations were taken using the IPHAS observing procedures and were reduced using the IPHAS pipeline:\nthe procedure includes bias subtraction, flat-fielding, nonlinearity correction and astrometric fit. The emission associated with CK Vul was centred on one of the four CCDs.\nThe pipeline also obtains photometry of all point sources in\nthe field, stored in a catalogue. The 2004 observations were\ntaken under non-photometric conditions, with intermittent\nhigh cloud.\n\u2032\n\nThe r filter is used for the continuum subtraction, but\nit should be noted that its broad coverage (5500\u20137000\u00c5) also\ncovers H\u03b1. The H\u03b1 filter has a width of 95\u00c5, and includes\nthe [N ii] lines. An emission line image was obtained from\nthe difference of the H\u03b1 and r \u2032 images.\nThe H\u03b1 and r \u2032 observations have different values for the\nimage quality. A direct subtraction of the r \u2032 image therefore\nleaves significant stellar residuals\u2013we note that the field is\nvery crowded. Both positive and negative residuals are also\ncaused by the fact that stars show variable r \u2032 \u2212H\u03b1 colours\ndue to the stellar H\u03b1 absorption, and by TiO bands for M\nstars. This can affect the r \u2032 \u2212H\u03b1 colour by as much as a magnitude. To circumvent these problems, continuum subtraction was done in a different way. We used the DAOPHOT\nprogram to obtain a list of stellar positions for the r \u2032 image.\nThis list was subsequently used to find the counterparts of\nthese sources in the H\u03b1 image. A point-spread function fitting was done to obtain the magnitude (in H\u03b1), and to subtract these stellar sources. The same fitting and subtraction\nprocedure was also carried out in the r \u2032 image. Finally, the\nresidual r \u2032 -band image was subtracted from the residual H\u03b1\nimage. This procedure greatly reduces the stellar residuals\nbut may subtract true H\u03b1 emission stars. We checked for\n\nthe presence of such stars in the area surrounding CK Vul\nbut did not find any.\nThe astrometry of the image was re-calibrated using the\npositions of the stars in the Second US Naval Observatory\nCCD Astrograph Catalog (UCAC2 Zacharias et al. 2004).\nThe accuracy of the astromery, based on the RMS of the fit,\nis 0.1 arcsec.\nBelow we refer to the final image as 'the H\u03b1 image'\n(adopting the name of the filter). However, the reader should\nbe aware that the [N ii] lines may contribute or even dominate the line emission within the filter pass band.\n2.2.2\n\nWHT\n\nH\u03b1 images have previously been presented by Naylor et al.\n(1992). The original data were kindly provided to us and\nre-reduced using IRAF. The observations were carried out\nat the William Herschel Telescope, on La Palma, on August\n10, 1991. They made use of a small CCD at the auxiliary\nCassegrain port; the scale is 0.1 arcsec/pixel. The observations in H\u03b1 were de-biased and flat-field corrected. The\nimage was calibrated with respect to the positions of the\nstars on the INT image: the RMS of the relative fit is 0.05\narcsec.\n2.3\n\nLong-slit spectrometry\n\nThe long-slit observations were obtained with the Manchester echelle spectrometer (MES: Meaburn et al. 2003) combined with the f/7.9 focus of the 2.1 m San Pedro M\u00e1rtir,\nUNAM telescope, on 2006 July 12. This echelle spectrometer has no cross-disperser. For the present observations a\nfilter of 90\u00c5 bandwidth was used to isolate the 87th order\ncontaining the H\u03b1 and [N ii] emission lines. A 1024 \u00d7 1024\nSITE CCD with 24\u03bcm pixels was used. Seeing conditions\nwere variable, with a mean of 2 arcsec during the observations.\nFour slit positions across CK Vul were obtained. The\nfirst two positions employed an on-chip binning factor 2 \u00d7\n2 and a slit width of 150\u03bcm, equivalent to 11 km s\u22121 and\n0.6 arcsec increments along the slit. However due to the\nfaintness of the emission and the relatively poor seeing, the\nthird and fourth positions were obtained with a 4\u00d74 binning\nand a 300\u03bcm wide slit corresponding to 20 km s\u22121 resolution\nand 1.2 arcsec increments along the slit for better sensitivity.\nThe slit orientations of the latter are shown in Fig. 7 and\nthe spectra in Fig. 8. The slits were oriented in all cases N\u2013\nS and the integration times were 1800 seconds. The spectra\nwere reduced and calibrated in wavelength against a Th\u2013Ar\nlamp using standard procedures.\n\n\f4\n\nHajduk et al.\n\nFigure 2. The INT H\u03b1 image of CK Vul, before continuum subtraction. A logarithmic intensity scale is used to bring out the\nfaint emission. The vertical bar is 30 arsec in length; North is at\nthe top and East is left.\n\n2.4\n\nOther data\n\nAn earlier radio continuum observation of CK Vul at 20 cm\nwas performed by Bode et al. (1987), on January 28, 1984.\nThey found an upper limit of 1.52 mJy, with a spatial resolution of 14 arcsec. Due to the low resolution, this limit\nincludes both the compact source and the extended nebulosity.\nProposed R-band and JHK counterparts are summarised in Evans et al. (2002). We consider these to be uncertain, referring to unrelated (field) stars. 2MASS finds all\nthese to have the colours of normal stars. Observations in\nother wavelength regimes include flux measurements at 850\nand 450\u03bcm and flux densities derived from re-analysis of the\nIRAS data (Evans et al. 2002). Upper limits were found for\nMSX (8.3 \u03bcm) and IRAS 100 \u03bcm.\nGLIMPSE/Spitzer images of the field confirm that all\n2MASS sources show stellar Rayleigh-Jeans colours. This\nincludes the star inside the cavity south of the radio source,\nwhich was studied by Harrison (1996).\n\n3\n3.1\n\nRESULTS OF THE OBSERVATIONS\nOptical lobes\n\nThe H\u03b1 image, derived from the Aug. 2004 (long) integrations, is shown in Fig. 2. It shows the dense star field, and\nthe compact structure first found by Shara et al. (1985). The\nnebulosity appears as a partial ring, extending 15-arcsec\nacross E-W. The star at the centre of the ring, originally\n\nsuspected to be CK Vul, is now thought to be a field star.\nFaint nebular emission is lost in the dense star field.\nThe corresponding continuum-subtracted optical image\nis presented in Fig. 3. The image shows that the previously\nknown nebulosity is located at the waist of a much larger,\nbipolar structure. The bipolar lobes are edge-brightened: the\nfilled emission is just visible in the northern lobe but is below the detection limit in the southern lobe. A number of\nsmall condensations are visible, two of which delineate the\ntips of the lobes. A bright condensation is seen on the SE\nlobe. The angular distance between the tips of the lobes\nis 70 arcsec. The filter transmission includes both H\u03b1 and\n[N ii], and either line may contribute in different areas of the\nstructures.\nThe central region is shown in more detail in Fig. 3B.\nA funnel-like structure is seen, with one side much brighter\nthan the other. (But whether the structure is in fact a cavity\nis not known.) Four other knots are visible: each of these\ncomponents are numbered on the image as in Shara et al.\n(1985). An arc connects knots 2 and 4, but it is not part of\na closed ring. The three-dimensional structure cannot easily\nbe deduced from the image. In addition to the numbering of\nShara et al. (1985), we number (6) the central diffuse source\nand (7) the more diffuse emission between knots 4 and 5.\nWe note that a stellar source on the western ring was\nsubtracted in the continuum removal process. This left the\nblank residual below knot 3. Some compact H\u03b1 emission was\nlikely subtracted in this process, as suggested by the residuals. This problem occurs when a star is much brighter than\ncoincident H\u03b1 emission, but dos not affect other locations\nwithin the nebulosity. Fig. 4A shows the inner region of r \u2032 band INT image, where this star is visible to the West of\nthe radio source.\n3.2\n\nRadio source\n\nThe radio emission is shown in Fig. 4A superposed on the\nINT r \u2032 -band image. The brightest emission-line regions are\nfaintly visible in the r \u2032 -band, because the wavelengths of\nthe emission lines fall within the filter transmission curve.\nThe radio source is located between knots 1 and 6 (Fig.\n3). Three stars located in the region below the funnel could\nbe candidates for the central star, but they do not coincide\nwith the compact radio source. The radio source also does\nnot coincide with any of the H\u03b1+[N ii] bright knots.\nAn accidental superposition of a background radio\nsource is improbable, due to the excellent coincidence of the\nposition of the radio emission with the nebula. Moreover,\nonly one other source with comparable flux to the one referred to CK Vul was found in the full primary beam field\n(FWHM) of 9.0 arcmin.\nThe radio source is close to the brightest part of the\nelongated knot '1'. Fig. 4B shows the WHT image, which\nhas better spatial resolution. A faint elongation or separate\nsource is indicated just below knot '1'; on the INT image this\nmerges with the knot because of the worse seeing. The faint\nelongation is within 0.5 arcsec of the radio source (right-most\nplus sign in Fig. 4B). It has a very faint r \u2032 -band counterpart,\nconfirming it is an emission line region. To classify this extension as a separate source would require either higher angular resolution, or kinematic data. Given the extent of the\nemission line regions around the radio source, the likelihood\n\n\fStar and nebula of CK Vul\n\n5\n\nFigure 4. The radio source superposed on the optical images.\nNorth is top, east is left. The position of the radio source is\n19h 47m 38.074s +27o 18\u2032 45.16\u2032\u2032 . The knots are indicated by their\nnumbers. A (top): superposed on the r \u2032 -band INT image. The image is 21.5 arcsec across horizontally. Radio contours are at 0.075,\n0.15,0.3,0.6,0.9,1.2 mJy/beam, from the 2005 VLA observations\n(natural weighting). The oval indicates the size of the beam; the\nblack bar is 5 arcsec long. B (bottom): superposed on the WHT\nH\u03b1 image. The right-most plus sign indicates the position of the\nradio source. the left-most plus sign gives the geometric centre of\nthe bipolar lobes.\nFigure 3.

The vertical bar is 30 arsec in length. B (Bottom):\nThe central region, corresponding to the emission detected by\nShara et al. (1985). The linear contours and the grey scale refer\nto the same image. The peaks on either side of the apparent 'funnel' are 5 arcsec apart. The numbers 1 to 5 correspond to the\nknots detected by Shara et al. (1985). Numbers 6 & 7 have been\nadded in this paper; see text for discussion.\n\nof a chance superposition is rather high. However, it is our\nonly \u2013but speculative\u2013 candidate for an optical counterpart.\nThe radio source is situated in a cavity close to the\nbrightest part of the nebulosity. Nebulosity located further\nfrom the radio source shows a tendency of decreasing brightness with distance from the radio source. This indicates that\nthe radio source is associated with the current energy source\n\nof the nebula, and reveals the position, if not the identification, of the central object.\nThe radio source is to a very good (1-arcsec) accuracy\nlocated at the centre of symmetry of the tips of the bipolar\nnebula. This point is indicated by the left-most plus sign in\nFig. 4B. This also supports the identification of the radio\nsource as the central object.\nThe INT data show that at the position of the radio\nsource, there is no optical counterpart down to a conservative limit of r \u2032 > 23. The i-band IPHAS image is less deep,\nand gives a limit of i\u2032 > 20.\n3.3\n\nExpansion\n\nThe WHT image compared to the INT image allows us to\nsearch for temporal variations in the nebula.

The images are aligned\non the stellar positions. The relative (rms) accuracy is 0.05\narcsec.\nSeveral emission-line nebulosities have changed position, in particular knots 4 and 5. (The object to the West of\nknot 3 has moved north: this is interpreted as a high proper\nmotion star.) The change in position is away from the central\nradio source, as indicated by the arrows in Fig. 5. The positions of knots 4 and 5 are given in Table 2. The indicated relative motion from 1991 to 2004 is (\u03bc\u03b1 , \u03bc\u03b4 ) = (\u22120.16, \u22120.46)\narcsec, and (\u03bc\u03b1 , \u03bc\u03b4 ) = (0.36, \u22120.67) arcsec, for knot 4 and\n5, respectively.\nThe original positions of the two components are obtained by extrapolation back to 1670. The extrapolated position of knot 4 is coincident with the position of the radio\nsource, assumed to represent the central star. The agreement\nis worse for knot 5, possibly due to its extended, irregular\nstructure, which is better resolved in the WHT image than\nin the INT image (Table 2). Residual image distortions may\nalso be present in the WHT images.\nThe observed motion of these two components, located\noutside the inner region of the nebula, implies that the observed lobes are indeed the remnants of the 1670 event. It\n\nalso confirms our interpretation of the radio source as the\neruptive object.\nTo improve the sensitivity to expansion, we subtracted\nthe IPHAS image from the WHT observations. The subtracted image showed residuals at the position of the two\nouter, moving knots, the central brightest nebulosities, the\nfaint arc and other nebular structures, present on the H\u03b1\nimage. Applying a constant scaling factor prior to the subtraction, to reduce the image scale of the IPHAS image,\ngreatly reduced these residuals.\nFigure 6 shows the residuals of the two knots, and the\nbrightest part of the inner nebula, for different positions of\nthe centre of the expansion. The best fit was obtained for\nthe assumed expansion centre lying within 2 arcsec of the\nradio emission. The constant scaling factor assumes that the\nmaterial seen in the field of CK Vul is coming from the 1670\neruption event and is flowing ballistically.\nUnfortunately, the tips of the lobes of the outer nebula\nare outside of the WHT frame. However, the tip of the southern lobe is just visible on the plate published in Shara et al.\n(1985) (their Fig. 8). Comparison shows that this tip has\nmoved by roughly 2.5 arcsec in the intervening 20 years.\nWithin the uncertainties, this proper motion is consistent\nwith a 1670 ejection event.\n\n\fStar and nebula of CK Vul\n\n7\n\nTable 3. Line fluxes for the different knots, as measured from the\nINT image. For knot 3, the flux includes a non-subtracted star.\nThe values for knots 6 and 7 are also uncertain. The uncertainty\nin the flux conversion factor is estimated at 10 per cent.

The magnitudes were converted to Bessell filters\non Landolt standard stars using the colour transformations\n\u2032\n\nr \u2212 RLan = +0.275(R \u2212 I)Lan + 0.008\n(r \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 ) = 1.052(R \u2212 I)Lan + 0.004\nThe magnitudes were converted into flux units per \u00c5 using\nthe Bessell et al. (1987) coefficients for R. The integrated\nin-band flux was obtained by multiplying by the equivalent\nwidth of the filter (80\u00c5); this was divided by the data count\n(ADU) for each star to get a flux per data count. We find\na conversion value of (94 \u00b1 6) \u00d7 10\u221220 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 per data\ncount. This factor was applied to the data counts for each\nof the knots in the continuum-subtracted image.\nThe results are listed in Table 3. The line fluxes contain\ncontributions from H\u03b1, and from the two [N ii] lines: the\nfilter transmission is within 5% of the peak transmission\nfor each of the lines. Based on the spectroscopic data, H\u03b1\naccounts for typically half to a quarter of the measured line\nflux, but for knot 4 we do not detect H\u03b1.\nThe changes between the two INT images, measured in\nthe same way, indicate a 0.08 mag (approx. 10%) change in\nthe brightness of the knots, but this varies between knots by\nmore than 10%. The standard deviation for the background\nstars alone is 0.05 mag, so that we do not see conclusive\nevidence for brightness evolution.\nThe brightest knots are those closest to the radio source.\nThis suggest that their excitation arises from a central\nsource.\n3.4\n\nSpectroscopy\n\nOur echelle spectra show [N ii] 6584/H\u03b1 ratios between 1\nand 5. Individual values are listed in Table 3. Because of\nthe low S/N, these need confirmation. Knot 4 has no H\u03b1\ndetected and could have a very high ratio.\nThese ratios can be compared to other values reported\nin the literature. Shara et al. (1985) analyze spectra of the\nthree brightest nebulosities, numbered 1\u20133. They find consistent line intensities, with remarkably strong [S ii] emission\n\nFigure 7. Positions of the two long slit echelle spectra discussed\nin the text. The scale bar is 20 arcsec long.\n\ncomparable to H\u03b1, and a ratio [Nii]6584/H\u03b1 \u2248 3. The [S ii]\n6716/6730 line ratio is approximately two. [O iii] is also seen,\nseveral times brighter than H\u03b2, but weakened by the extinction.\nA spectrum of a faint knot is reported by Naylor et al.\n(1992). The knot has [N ii] 6584/H\u03b1 \u2248 1, and a [S ii]\n6716/6730 ratio of unity. It is not clear which knot this represents: their slit orientation at position angle 45 degrees\ncovered knot 4 and 6. Our much higher line ratio for knot 4\nsuggests Naylor et al. observed knot 6.\nA spectrum taken with a 4-arcsec slit oriented perpendicular to this direction is reported by Cohen (1985). Their\nspectrum shows intermediate values for both the N and S\nline ratios compared to the previous two papers.\n\n3.5\n\nKinematics\n\nThe two long-slit spectra with better signal to noise are\nshown in Fig. 8; only signal from the relatively bright knots\nin the core was recorded. The top and middle panels in Fig.\n8 show both the H\u03b1 and [N ii] 6584\u00c5 emission lines for each\nslit position. The locations of the slits are shown in Fig. 7.\nThe first slit (top panel) intersects knot 2 and a section of\nthe southern arc, whereas the second slit (middle panel) located to the West of the previous one, intersects knot 3 and\nthe edge of knot 4. The lower panel shows the corresponding P\u2013V arrays for the [N ii] 6584\u00c5 line with heliocentric\nvelocity scales.\nThe spectra show that the [N ii] 6584\u00c5 line is consistently stronger than H\u03b1. Although H\u03b1 is barely detected,\nthe S/N is enough to show that its line profile follows the\nsame wide structure of [N ii] 6584\u00c5. The line profiles are\npeculiar in the sense that the emission seems to arise only\nfrom localised regions and with a wide velocity range, of\nthe order of 350 km s\u22121 , somehow akin to those observed in\nsupernovae blasts (e.g. Riesgo & L\u00f3pez 2005).\nThe brightest region of each line profile yields the following heliocentric velocities: for knot 2 we find an approximate velocity of \u221280 km s\u22121 ; for knot 3, 0 km s\u22121 ; for\n\n\f8\n\nHajduk et al.\n\nFigure 8.

Lower left frame: knot 2 (upper) and the\nsouthern arc (lower emission). Lower right frame: knot 3 (upper)\nand knot 4 (lower emission).\n\nknot 4, +60 km s\u22121 and for the southern arc, +70 km s\u22121 .\nFrom these line profiles the systemic velocity cannot be determined with confidence. However, since the observed heliocentric velocities are heavily blue-shifted for knots 2 &\n3, it is reasonable to assume that there we are detecting\nmaterial that is mainly coming towards us whereas the opposite is observed in knot 4 and the southern arc. From this\nkinematic behaviour and the morphology of the region (see\nFig. 3) a possible interpretation is that of a rapidly expanding (and disrupted) torus or equatorial structure, centred at\nroughly \u221250 km s\u22121 and where knots 2 & 3 are part of the\nforeground (approaching) equatorial structure and knot 4\nand the southern arc are part of the background (receding)\npart of the torus.\nThe tip of the southern lobe was covered by two of the\nslit settings. There is a faint trace in both spectra of a velocity feature at the location of the tip with a velocity of\nabout \u2212175 km s\u22121 . The sign and magnitude of this velocity\nis consistent with the bipolar lobes being oriented perpendicular to the equatorial structure discussed above and with\nthe northern lobe moving away and the southern one coming\ntowards us.\nThe kinematics and structure of the line profiles discussed here indicate that shocks are a main, if not the only,\ncontributor to the excitation of these emission lines, in agreements with the arguments of the preceding section.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nPHYSICAL PARAMETERS\nExtinction distance\n\nThe spectra of Shara et al. (1985) show a strong Balmer\ndecrement, corresponding to E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.82 \u00b1 0.23, or\nA(V ) = 2.5). Based on the weighted mean of this and the\nextinction towards a distant field star ( E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.7 \u00b1\n0.1), they adopt A(V ) = 2.2 \u00b1 0.3.\n\nShara et al. (1985) locate the nebula beyond an extinction layer, located at 550 \u00b1 150 pc distance. Weight et al.\n(1993) deduce an upper limit of 2 kpc: they detect two CO\nclumps, with kinematic distances of 500 pc and 2 kpc. The\ntwo clumps together would result in E(B \u2212 V) = 1.25, suggesting that CK Vul must lie in front of the more distant\nclump.\nWe have assessed the IPHAS photometry of point\nsources in the vicinity of CK Vul to constrain the distanceextinction relation in this field. Within a field of 4.5'\u00d74.5',\nwe find a few essentially unreddened main sequence stars,\nand then a dearth of stars to AV \u223c 1.2 (E(B \u2212 V ) \u2243 0.4).\nThis jump in extinction may represent the dust layer at\n550 pc described by Shara et al. (1985). We have crossidentified a group of 10 early A stars (presumed to be\ndwarfs) for which there are 2MASS JHK measurements as\nwell as IPHAS r \u2032 , i\u2032 and H\u03b1 data, and used them to obtain\na sample of reddenings and distances consistent with their\nlikely spectral types. These early A stars range in brightness between r \u2032 \u223c 14 and r \u2032 \u223c 18, and are consistent with\nextinctions in the range 0.9 \u00b1 0.2 < AV < 5.4 \u00b1 0.5. The\ndeduced distances fall in the range 2\u20134 kpc. The reddening\ndoes not increase in any organised manner with distance,\nand the extinction layer(s) appear to be patchy.\nWe will here use a distance of 600 pc. The extinctions\nindicate an upper limit for the distance of CK Vul of 4 kpc.\n\n4.2\n\nVelocities\n\nThe radial velocity range is about 350 km s\u22121 . The highest\nblue-shifted velocities are seen just to the north of knot 2 and\nmay represent the inner edge of the bipolar lobe, oriented\nclose to the line of sight along the edge of the torus. We do\nnot see a similar extended velocity structure at red-shifted\nvelocities. This may be due to the placement of the slits,\nor may indicate some internal extinction at that location.\nThe southern tip is blue-shifted at \u2212175 km s\u22121 : similar to\nthe extreme velocity near the torus, but likely less inclined\ntowards us.\nThe proper motion of the knots 4 and 5 are around\n37 mas/year and 59 mas/year respectively. For the outer\ntips of the bipolar lobes, the radial distance to the central\nradio source of 35 arcsec indicates a proper motion of 105\nmas/year. Our measured proper motion of the southern tip\ncorresponds to 120 \u00b1 25 mas yr\u22121 . For a distance of 600 pc,\nthe respective tangential velocities are 106 and 169 km/s\nfor the knots, and 340 km s\u22121 for the tips of the bipolar\nlobes. Assuming a systemic velocity vhel = \u221250 km s\u22121 , the\nspace velocity of the tip of the bipolar lobe becomes vej \u2248\n360 km s\u22121 .\nThe bipolar flow is inclined by 20 degrees with respect\nto the plane of the sky, from these numbers.\n\n4.3\n\nExtended nebula\n\nThe nebula is detected only in ionized lines and in dust. It\nis possible that emission lines reveal only part of the nebula,\nwith the remainder not ionized or too faint. Parameters of\nthe extended nebula must therefore depend on estimations.\nShara et al. (1985) derive ne < 102 cm\u22123 , based on the\n[S ii] line ratio in knot 1. Naylor et al. (1992) find a higher\n\n\fStar and nebula of CK Vul\ndensity ne \u2248 103 cm\u22123 , based on the [S ii] line ratio of a\nfaint knot (possibly knot 4 or knot 6). If we assume that\nthe system of knots 1,2,3,4,6 represents a partially ionized\ntorus with density n = 102 cm\u22123 , diameter of 10 arcsec,\nthickness and height of 5 arcsec, the total mass becomes\nM \u223c 2\u00d710\u22125 M\u2299 . If, on the other hand, we assume that the\ntotal extent is given by the bipolar nebula (35 arcsec radius),\nand assume a typical density of n = 102 cm\u22123 , the total\nmass becomes M \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u22122 M\u2299 . The dust mass derived\nby Evans et al. (2002) gives M \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u22122 M\u2299 for a typical\ndust-to-gas ratio of 100 (assuming hydrogen-rich gas). Thus,\na model of a cloud of radius 30 arcsec and average density\nn = 102 cm\u22123 is consistent with observational constraints.\nShara et al. (1985) suggests that the extended nebula\nwas ionized during the 1670 eruption and is now recombining. This assumption of a slowly recombining nebula\npresents some problems. N+ recombines much faster than\nhydrogen, so the high [N ii]/H\u03b1 ratio would require that no\nsignificant recombination has yet occurred even in the denser\nknots. For [N ii], at a density of 100 cm\u22123 the recombination\ntime scale is 75 yr (Lechner & Kimeswenger 2004). Densities\nof ne >\n\u223c 102 cm\u22123 require continuous ionization.\nThe line ratios listed by Shara et al. (1985) are in\ngood qualitative agreement with the radiative shock models\nof McKee & Hollenbach (1980), although H\u03b1 is somewhat\nfainter than seen in those models. In particular, the [S ii]\n6716+6730/H\u03b1 \u223c 1, [N i] 5200/H\u03b2 \u223c 1 and the strength\nof the [N ii] 6584\u00c5 line are indicative of shock velocities\nv \u223c 100 km s\u22121 . (Shara et al. (1985) do not list or identify\nthe [N i] 5200\u00c5 line, but it is apparent in their spectrum.)\nThe presence of [O iii], if shock-ionized, indicates shock velocities above 100 km s\u22121 .\n\n5\n5.1\n\nTHE COMPACT RADIO SOURCE\nEmission mechanism\n\nThe fact that we have a compact but resolved source suggests thermal free\u2013free emission for the origin of the radio emission. This is supported by the observed brightness\ntemperature. At 5 GHz, the observed diameter (0.11 arcsec\nFWHM of a deconvolved gaussian) gives a brightness temperature of Tb = 6000 K. At 8 GHz we find Tb = 2000 K.\nAssuming the electron temperature is Te = 104 K, the optical depth at 5 GHz is \u03c4 \u2248 0.9. This predicts at 8 GHz that\nTb \u2248 2700 K, in reasonable agreement with observations.\nThe emission is optically thick at 1.4 GHz, explaining the\nnon-detection at this frequency (Bode et al. 1987).\nThe lack of an infrared counterpart presents a problem,\nhowever. Optically thin free\u2013free emission predicts approximately 0.6 mJy at 8\u03bcm, assuming a \u03bd \u22120.1 index. The upper\nlimit for a counterpart to the radio source at 8\u03bcm is around\n0.2 mJy. The only possible non-stellar source is a possible\nfaint source 2 arcsec south-east of the radio source, which is\nabsent from the Spitzer images at shorter wavelengths. The\nlack of an 8\u03bcm detection can be explained by very high extinction. However, it also suggests to explore different emission mechanism.\nSmall grains can emit appreciable radio emission\nthrough their rotation. The electric dipole emission is\ndescribed in Draine & Lazarian (1998) and references\n\n9\n\ntherein. Using emissivities per hydrogen atom tabulated in\nDraine & Lazarian (1998), we find that our radio flux would\nrequire \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u2299 of gas (assuming normal composition\nof the gas). This is a plausible value for the radio source,\nand would give densities around n \u223c 107 cm\u22123 . However,\nthis emission produces a positive spectral index between 5\nand 8 GHz, while we find a flat flux distribution. There is\nalso no evidence for the required very small grains in the\ninfrared spectral energy distribution.\nSynchrotron and cyclotron emission (Linksy 1996), from\nrelativistic electrons moving in a magnetic field, give brightness temperatures much higher than we observe. However,\nif our radio source is found not to be resolved, this becomes\na possibility.\n5.2\n\nDensity and mass of the radio core\n\nIf the radio emission is due to free\u2013free emission, we can\nderive some parameters of the originating nebula. Using the\nobserved flux and assuming \u03c4 = 0.9 and Te = 104 K at\n5 GHz, the emission measure becomes EM = n2e l = 8.1 \u00d7\n107 pc cm\u22126 where ne is the electron density and l the depth\nof the emitting region. The latter is taken as the same as the\nFWHM of the radio source (assuming symmetry), or 66 AU\nat 600 pc.\nWe arrive at a density of Ne = 5\u00d7105 cm\u22123 . The mass of\nthe ionized region becomes Mi \u2248 4\u00d710\u22127 M\u2299 . This assumes\na H-rich chemical composition: H-poor gas requires more\nmass per electron.\nFor a filling factor equal to unity, a relation between\nthe hydrogen line flux and the optically thin free\u2013free S5GHz\nflux density is given by Pottasch (1984) assuming hydrogenrich material. This gives an expected F0 (H\u03b1) \u2248 1.5 \u00d7\n10\u221212 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 . The IPHAS H\u03b1 filter has an equivalent width of approximately 80\u00c5 and a peak transmission\nof 90 per cent (Drew et al. 2005): the unreddened magnitude of the central object in the H\u03b1 filter should have been\nm \u223c 12.3. The (undetected) object is much weaker. The\nemission located 0.5 arcsec away from the radio source is\n1.6 \u00d7 10\u221215 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 , three orders fainter. This requires\nAR > 7.5, corresponding to AV > 10 for a standard extinction law and pure H\u03b1 emission.\nThe [N ii] 6584/6548\u00c5 lines are within the IPHAS H\u03b1\nfilter transmission. However, these lines have a critical density of ncr = 9 \u00d7 104 cm\u22123 . We derive an electron density\nof ne = 5 \u00d7 105 cm\u22123 , suggesting that these lines do not\ncontribute in the central region.\nThe lack of a clear H\u03b1 counterpart to the radio source\ncan also be interpreted as evidence that the core is H-poor.\nHydrogen-poor gas tends to have lower electron temperatures, as the cooling per nucleus is more efficient. We ran\nsome Cloudy models to obtain indicative values. The models are similar to those described in Hajduk et al. (2005), but\nuse a PG1159 stellar model (Rauch 2003), with luminosity\nL = 0.5 L\u2299 , a density ne = 5\u20137 \u00d7 105 cm\u22123 (depending on\nstellar temperature Teff ) and an inner radius of 13 AU. For\nTeff = 60, 80, 100, 120 kK, we find Te = 8100, 8400, 8700,\n9200K, respectively. These are lower than corresponding values of H-rich gas, but not dramatically so. The physical\ncause of the relatively high temperatures is the suppression\nof the forbidden lines at these high densities, which reduces\nthe cooling rate. The model temperatures are within the\n\n\f10\n\nHajduk et al.\n\nrange derived from the radio free-free spectrum. But in the\nabsence of measured line ratios, the models are exploratory\nonly.\n\n5.3\n\nLuminosity\n\nThe recombination timescale of the radio core is less than a\nyear. The central region is therefore continuously ionized: although no central star is visible, its continuing existence can\nbe inferred. Recombining gas can also be ruled out because\nit would show a very low electron temperature Te \u223c 103 K,\nmuch lower than the observed brightness temperature.\nThe luminosity of the ionizing star can be estimated assuming that all photons above the Lyman limit ionize hydrogen, and that the object emits as a black body. The number\nof ionizing photons reaches a maximum at a temperature of\nabout T\u2217 = 7 \u00d7 104 K. For this temperature, the required\nblack body luminosity is L\u2217 = 0.5 L\u2299 . For other temperatures within the range 40\u2013100 kK, the luminosity is within\na factor of 1.5 of this value. Stellar atmosphere models require a little higher luminosity as a black body emits more\nionizing photons than a realistic atmosphere of the same\ntemperature (e.g., at T = 50 kK, a Kurucz model gives 10\n% fewer H-ionizing photons than does a black body). Geometrical considerations also indicate that this luminosity is\na lower limit, and the real luminosity could be a few times\nhigher.\nSuch a luminosity, combined with a high stellar temperature, gives an unreddened magnitude of order V0 >\n\u223c 17. No\nstar is detected near this magnitude. The ROSAT all sky\nsurvey did not detect any source at the position of CK Vul.\nSevelli (2004) reports extreme faintness of CK Vul in the\nSWP IUE spectra; the aperture of the instrument included\nthe position of the radio source. The lack of detection may\nbe due to a higher stellar temperature together with high\nobscuration.\nFor comparison, at the adopted distance, the peak\nabsolute magnitude of the AD1670 eruption was around\nM (V)0 \u2248 \u22129 to \u22128. The current luminosity implied by the\nradio source is a factor of 105 fainter.\n\n5.4\n\nDust\n\nThe infrared spectrum of CK Vul (Evans et al. 2002) shows\ntwo components, with dust temperatures around 550 K and\n25 K. Their two-component dust model yields approximate\ndust masses of 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22129 and 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 M\u2299 . The mass of the\nfirst component agrees well with the derived ionized mass,\nassuming normal dust-to-gas ratios. The model was based on\nIRAS flux densities: the large IRAS apertures include both\nthe core and the extended nebula, and the second component\nmay be identified with the extended nebula.\nThe new high-resolution Glimpse limit is a factor of\n100 below the IRAS 12\u03bcm flux. We ran dust models with\nparameters ri = 2 \u00d7 1014 cm, ro = 1015 cm, density at inner\nedge 5 \u00d7 105 cm\u22123 , density distribution n \u221d r \u22121 , and a star\nwith T = 6 \u00d7 104 K and L = 0.5 L\u2299 . The (assumed H-rich)\nshell has a mass consistent with the ionized mass. For silicate\ndust, this yields predicted flux densities of F8 = 0.1 mJy and\nF12 = 0.6 mJy, well within observational limits. Carbon-rich\ndust (as assumed by Evans et al. (2002) for their hotter dust\n\ncomponent) would be several times brighter at 8\u03bcm. These\nexploratory models differ from Evans et al. (2002) mainly in\nthat they give lower dust temperatures (200\u2013300 K).\nThe peculiar light curve with several dips may be due\nto epochs of dust formation. In support of this, Hevelius\ncomments that during the second peak (April 1671), the\nsource appeared reddish (Shara et al. 1985). The brightness\nof the initial eruption suggest that it did not suffer the lineof-sight extinction of the current radio source, and that the\ndust formed afterwards.\n\n6\n6.1\n\nTHE NATURE OF CK VUL\nObservational constraints\n\nThe current luminosity and high temperature places the central object high on the white dwarf cooling track, e.g., a 1 L\u2299\nwhite dwarf has Teff \u2248 65 kK and a cooling age of tc \u223c 106 yr\n(Bloecker 1995).\nThe compactness of the radio source implies it is not\nexpanding, as the expansion velocity would be less than\n1 km s\u22121 , or below the escape velocity. We can therefore assume that the radio nebula is part of a stable structure, such\nas a rotating disk, and could predate the eruption. The bipolar lobes are similar to those found in some young planetary\nnebulae and post-AGB stars. Such lobes can form where a\nspherical fast wind meets an existing equatorial obstruction\n(Icke 1987).\nAn area of low dust emission surrounding CK Vul is\nseen in IRAS images (Evans et al. 2002). This resembles\ncases where the ISM has been swept up by a stellar wind\n(Zijlstra & Weinberger 2002) and suggests CK Vul has gone\nthrough phases of high mass loss over the past \u223c 105 \u2013106 yr.\nTogether, these constraints favour an evolved object,\nand the morphology favours a binary object. Two possible\ninterpretations are a nova, and a thermal pulse.\nOne should consider whether a supernova classification\ncan truly be ruled out. The [S ii]/H\u03b1 \u223c 1 ratio is diagnostic\nof supernova remnants. Also, the current luminosity is a\ntypical value for a pulsar, and the radio spectrum is similar\nto pulsar wind nebulae (e.g. Temim et al. 2006). The object\nH 2-12, a knot inside the Kepler supernova remant, shows\nsimilar line ratios and velocities to CK Vul (Riesgo & L\u00f3pez\n2005). However, there is no X-ray source at this position, nor\nis there significant radio emission from the extended nebula.\nThe bipolar symmetry of CK Vul differs from the structures\nseen in supernova remnants. We conclude that a supernova\nclassification is unlikely.\nA 'gentle' supernova (Tout 2006) can be considered. An\naccreting helium white dwarf may ignite its helium at masses\nfar below the Chandrasekhar mass (Woosley & Weaver\n1994). The lack of observational evidence for sub-luminous\nsupernovae suggests that the ignition under such conditions\nmay be non-explosive. However, such objects may also have\nbeen classified wrongly. The models of Woosley & Weaver\n(1994) predict short-lived maxima, however.\nThe observations do not clearly support the possibility\nof a stellar merger (Kato 2003): a merger would be able to\nexplain the large drop in luminosity since the eruption, but\nwould lead to a bloated, cool star. The radio source requires\nan ionizing star.\n\n\fStar and nebula of CK Vul\n6.2\n\nA light nova\n\nClassical novae are dominated by massive white dwarfs:\nthese show frequent eruptions, but consequently eject relatively little mass. A lower-mass white dwarf with a low\naccretion rate can eject the most massive shell. However,\nsuch eruptions are rare as a consequence of the much longer\naccretion time scales. The current luminosity of CK Vul corresponds to an accretion rate of \u1e40acc \u223c 10\u221210 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . The\npeak temperature, for a thermal-nuclear runaway on a lowmass white dwarf, may not even reach 108 K limiting the\nnucleosynthesis wich occurs (Starrfield 2007).\nA large set of models covering a range of parameter space is presented by Prialnik & Kovetz (1995). Some\nof these approach the constraints set by CK Vul. For instance, their model with MWD = 0.65 M\u2299 , TWD = 3 \u00d7 107 K\nand \u1e40 = 10\u221210 M\u2299 yr\u22121 yields an ejection velocity of\n200 km s\u22121 , eruption amplitude of 16 mag, mass-loss time\nscale of 480 days (during which time the nova remains\nbright), and a very high peak luminosity of L = 8 \u00d7 104 L\u2299\n(Mbol = \u22127.5). The recurrence time scale of this model is\n106 yr.\nThis particular model gives an ejecta mass of 10\u22124 M\u2299 .\nThe highest prediced ejecta mass for a light nova is only\n7 \u00d7 10\u22124 M\u2299 (Yaron et al. 2005). On the one hand, this\nis three orders of magnitude higher than found in nearChandrasekhar-mass novae. On the other hand, it is one to\ntwo orders of magnitude below the derived nebular mass of\nCK Vul (and below the mass in the dust alone). It is however possible that part of this is swept-up material which\npredates the eruption.\n\n6.3\n\nA thermal pulse\n\nHelium ignition on the white dwarf cooling track has been\nobserved in V605 Aql (Clayton et al. 2006) and V4334 Sgr\n(Sakurai's Object: Asplund et al. 1999; Hajduk et al. 2005;\nEvans et al. 2006). Their light curves show similarities to\nCK Vul: a long lived maximum at M \u223c \u22125, with a brief\nphase of very high, dusty mass loss. Three further objects\nare known to have experienced a VLTP event in their evolution, as shown by the presence of hydrogen-poor central regions within a planetary nebula (Zijlstra 2002). Outflow Velocities are also similar, with observed values are\n\u223c 250 km s\u22121 for V605 Aql (Pollacco et al. 1992) and V4334\nSgr (Kerber et al. 2002).\nIf CK Vul is a VLTP, it would fall on an evolutionary sequence V4334 Sgr (Sakurai's Object: 10 yr), V605\nAql (90 yr), IRAS 15154\u22125258 (\u223c 103 yr) and the two more\nevolved objects A30/A78 (Zijlstra 2002). The first two are\nstill hidden inside a dense cocoon of dusty ejecta, but like\nCK Vul the central object is seen in radio emission. There\nare some morphological resemblances with CK Vul, with the\nejecta in these objects showing equatorial torii and polar\nknots. The origin of the morphologies are not known.\nThere are however also notable differences. The radio\nsource in CK Vul is much more compact than expected:\nin V605 Aql, which is at a larger distance, the 0.3-arcsec\ndense shell is expanding and there is no evidence for a nonexpanding component. The ejecta in both VLTP objects are\nalmost completely H-poor. In contrast, most knots in CK\nVul show significant H\u03b1 components, even if fainter than\n\n11\n\nexpected. (We do not detect H\u03b1 emission in knot 4, which is\nlikely H-poor. It is possible that the other knots have swept\nup ambient hydrogen.) CK Vul has a much lower current luminosity than the other five objects. Finally, fossil planetary\nnebulae are seen in all five objects, but CK Vul only shows a\nsurrounding hole in the ISM as evidence for past mass loss:\nthis suggests a much longer post-AGB time scale before its\neruption.\nVLTP events may show a characteristic double loop in\nthe HR diagram, over a time scale of a few hundred years\n(Hajduk et al. 2005). Direct observational evidence for a second loop is still lacking and the VLTP scenario is not well understood (Miller Bertolami et al. 2006). Observations during the 18th and 19th century (Shara et al. 1985) provide no\nindications for a second, decadal phase of high luminosity\nand low temperatures for CK Vul, as predicted by doubleloop models, but the extinction may have hidden such an\nevent. However, the low luminosity we derive is a severe\nconstraint for such models.\n\n6.3.1\n\nAccretion-induced pulse\n\nThe morphology shows similarities to evolved binary systems, such as symbiotics. This together with the compact\nradio source suggests variation on the standard VLTP scenario can be considered, involving accretion.\nA group of binary post-AGB stars, including RV Tau\nstars, show compact circumstellar disks, with typical sizes of\n10-100 AU (van Winckel 2003; de Ruyter et al. 2006). The\ndisks form when a close binary (P \u223c 1 yr) captures matter lost by the central star into a circumbinary disk. The\nradio source in CK Vul has the correct size to be the remnant of such a disk. CK Vul shows similarities in particular\nwith OH231.8+4.2, which shows bipolar lobes, an inner disk\nwith diameter of 50 AU as well as a 1000 AU dense torus\n(Matsuura 2006).\nIn such a system, the post-AGB evolution may be affected by accretion from the disk on the post-AGB star\n(Zijlstra et al. 2001). Such accretion could trigger a thermal\npulse later during the post-AGB evolution than wold otherwise occur. The circumstellar environment can explain the\nbipolar outflows. This possibility should be explored further\nfor CK Vul.\n\n7\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nA compact radio source allows us for the first time to identify the central object of the old nova CK Vul. The radio\nemission is modelled as thermal free-free emission, from a\ncompact nebula of diameter \u223c 60 AU. The density of the\nnebula is ne = 5 \u00d7 105 cm\u22123 . A high extinction through the\ncircumstellar shell is indicated by the lack of H\u03b1 detection\nat the position of the radio source. The ionization requires\na luminosity of the ionizing object of order 1 L\u2299 .\nDeep H\u03b1 images reveal a large bipolar outflow, with a\ndiameter of 70 arcsec. The nebulosity is brightest near the\nposition of the radio source, and shows various components.\nComparison with previous images shows significant expansion of the nebula. Extrapolating back shows that the H\u03b1\nstructures were ejected in the AD 1670 eruption. The centre\n\n\f12\n\nHajduk et al.\n\nof expansion is, within the uncertainties, identical to the radio source. Echelle spectra and proper motions give original\nejecta velocities of \u223c 360 km s\u22121 .\nThe observed characteristics differ from classical novae.\nNew models of nova eruption on cool, low-mass white dwarfs\ncan explain some of the observational constraints. A classification as a Very Late Thermal Pulse appears possible, possibly accretion-induced. The radio source is proposed to be the\nremnant of a circumbinary disk, as seen in some binary postAGB stars. The ejecta morphology are suggestive of binary\ninteraction. The radio source provides important information on the environment of CK Vul. However, at present CK\nVul still remains an enigma (Evans et al. 2002; Naylor et al.\n1992; Shara et al. 1985).\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Antonio Garcia, Kerttu Viironen and Ramarao\nTata for carrying out the INT observations.
