High-z data are more sensitive to the transverse momentum distribution\nof quarks in the initial nucleon whereas low-z data are preferentially influenced by the quark\nfragmentation process. The flavour dependence of the primordial momentum distribution of\ninitial quarks can be investigated by studying < P\u22a5 > for different hadrons produced in SIDIS.\nThe flavour dependence of the internal quark momentum distribution can manifest itself as a\ntarget isospin dependence of < P\u22a5 > and can be studied in SIDIS on targets with different\nisospin.\n2\n\nResults\n\nThe cross section of hadron production in SIDIS is determined by five independent variables\nQ2 , x, z, P\u22a5 , \u03c6\u03b3 .

Comparison of h\u00b1 and \u03c0 \u00b1\ndata in the high-z range (right).\n\nand P\u22a5 = |P~\u22a5 | is the transverse momentum of the hadron h with respect to the direction of\nthe photon. The azimuthal angle \u03c6\u03b3 is the angle between the positron scattering plane and the\nhadron production plane, both having the direction of the virtual photon in common.\nThe analysis of the experimental data was based on a multi-dimensional unfolding procedure.\nThe radiative corrections to P\u22a5 and to the number of events observed in every bin have been\ncalculated with the programs GMC and POLRAD2 1 . The main systematic uncertainties are\nthose related to the unfolding procedure and they were estimated to be less than 1.5% for\nh\u00b1 \u2212 production. The systematic uncertainty due to the \u03c6\u03b3 -dependence of the cross section\nand the detector efficiency is less than 1%. Other uncertainties (particle misidentification, cut\ndependence of the results etc.) are smaller compared to these numbers. For Ks0 production the\ntotal systematic uncertainty is less than 3%.\nAll systematic uncertainties have been added in quadrature to the statistical errors, the\ncombined values are shown in the figures.\n2.1\n\nDependence of < P\u22a5 > on z\n\nFrom the left panel of Fig. 1 the z-dependences of < P\u22a5 > for h+ , h\u2212 and Ks0 can be seen to be\nsimilar for 0.2 < z < 0.6. In this region < P\u22a5 > increases approximately linearly with z. The\nmain part of the statistics is located in this region of z so that the slopes of the cross sections\nversus P\u22a52 are approximately equal to each other for all particles considered above.\nFor z > 0.6 HERMES data show a significant difference in the dependence of < P\u22a5 > on\nz for h+ , h\u2212 and Ks0 : the average transverse momenta of h+ and Ks0 are higher than that for\nh\u2212 . It appears worth noting that some indication of this effect exists in the SLAC 2 and EMC 3\ndata already, albeit the large statistical uncertainties precluded a clear statement.\nThe pion fraction in the hadronic events is about 80-90% for z > 0.6. From Fig. 1 (right) can\nbe seen that within statistical uncertainties < P\u22a5 > for pion and hadron agrees with one another,\nfor both charges. In principle, the difference between \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 can be, at least partially, caused\nby exclusive processes. However, Fig. 2 (left) shows that the application of different cuts in the\nmissing mass up to 2 GeV does not change the observed difference of < P\u22a5 > between \u03c0 + and\n\u03c0\u2212 .\nThe difference of < P\u22a5 > between \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 could possibly be related to the fragmentation\nprocess. Indeed, usually the contribution of u-quarks dominates in deep inelastic lepton-nucleon\n \u0304\nscattering and u-quarks can create \u03c0 + -mesons in a one-step process picking up d-quarks\nfrom\n\n\fHERMES preliminary\n\nHERMES preliminary\n\nH\nD\n< P \u22a5 >/< P \u22a5>\n\n+\n\n<P\u22a5h >/<P\u22a5h >\n\nthe vacuum. In contrast, a u-quark producing a \u03c0 \u2212 needs at least a three-step process: the\n \u0304\nu-quark radiates first a gluon that subsequently converts into a dd-pair\nfrom which the d-quark\nthen picks up a \u016b-quark from the vacuum. The transverse momentum acquired in such a threestage process is on average greater than that in the one-step process, while Q2 , y and z remain\nunaffected. Hence the transverse momenta of \u03c0 \u2212 should be higher than that of \u03c0 + at large z,\nwhere few-step processes are more important than at low z where multi-step processes dominate.\nWhile Monte Carlo simulations confirm these qualitative considerations, the experimental data\nare in the strong contradiction with this picture; < P\u22a5 > for \u03c0 + is measured to be greater than\nthat for \u03c0 \u2212 . This presumably means that the difference of < P\u22a5 > between h+ and h\u2212 is not a\nresult of some difference in their fragmentation.\n\n-\n\n1\n\n1.05\n\nh\nh\n\n+\n-\n\n1.025\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\nMX>0 GeV\nMX>1.5 GeV\nMX>2 GeV\n\n0.975\n\n0.95\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nz\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nz\n\nFigure 2: Ratios of < P\u22a5 > for h\u2212 and h+ vs. z for different cuts on MX (left) and ratios of < P\u22a5 > for hydrogen\nand deuterium targets vs. z for h+ and h\u2212 (right).\n\nThe assumption that the transverse momentum distribution of quarks in the nucleon is\nstrongly flavour-dependent would manifest itself in a difference of < P\u22a5 > for differently charged\nleading mesons in SIDIS at high z. If then the difference in < P\u22a5 > between \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 is\nrelated to the difference of the internal transverse momenta of u- and d-quarks, a dependence of\n< P\u22a5 > on the target isospin may be anticipated. Indeed, the HERMES data indicate that such\na tendency might exist, as can be seen from Fig. 2 (right). The following MC parameters were\ntuned to arrive at a decent description of the data: the average intrinsic momenta for u- and\nd-quarks, average fragmentation transverse momentum and minimal mass of the string system.\nNeither z- nor x\u2212dependences of < P\u22a5 > could be described satisfactorily in the full kinematic\nu >= 0.54 GeV and < q d >= 0.16\nregion and the obtained parameters for u- and d-quarks (< q\u22a5\n\u22a5\nGeV) are so much different from one another that they appear unrealistic.\n2.2\n\nDependence of < P\u22a5 > on x\n\nFigure 3 shows the x-dependence of < P\u22a5 > for h+ , h\u2212 and KS0 produced on hydrogen for\ndifferent z-cuts. As can be seen from Fig. 3 (left), the x-dependences of < P\u22a5 > for h+ and\nh\u2212 coincide within the statistical uncertainty. Applying instead the cut z > 0.6, the relative\ncontribution of the primordial transverse momentum of the initial quarks to < P\u22a5 > is increased.\nA clear difference of < P\u22a5 > between h\u2212 , h+ and Ks0 appears at large z, see Fig. 3 (right). No\nsignificant x-dependence of < P\u22a5 > can be observed in the region z > 0.6, this agrees well with\nthe factorization property of the transverse and longitudinal momentum distributions of quarks\nin the nucleon.\n\n\fHERMES preliminary\n\n<P\u22a5>, GeV\n\n<P\u22a5>, GeV\n\nHERMES preliminary\n\nz>0.15\nh\n0.5\n\n+\n\nK0s\nh\n\nz>0.6\n0.6\n\n-\n\nK0s\nh\n\n-\n\nh\n\n+\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3 -2\n10\n\n10\n\n0.3 -2\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-1\n\nx\nFigure 3: < P\u22a5 > for\n\n3\n\nKs0\n\n\u00b1\n\nand h\n\nx\n\nvs. x for a hydrogen target, shown for z > 0.15 (left) and z > 0.6 (right).\n\nConclusions\n\nThe main features of the behaviour of average transverse momenta as seen in the HERMES data\nare the following:\n\u2022 Similar behaviour of average transverse momenta of Ks0 , h+ , and h\u2212 at z < 0.5.\n\u2022 A clear difference of < P\u22a5 > between positive and negative hadrons for z > 0.6.\n\u2022 The LUND model of fragmentation predicts a higher transverse momentum for h\u2212 than\nfor h+ at z > 0.6, while HERMES data show the opposite.\n\u2022 The difference in < P\u22a5 > for h+ , h\u2212 and Ks0 can be explained by the hypothesis that the\ninternal transverse momentum distributions of quarks in the nucleon are flavour dependent.\nThe difference of < P\u22a5 > between h+ and h\u2212 observed in DIS on hydrogen and deuterium\ntargets does not contradict this hypothesis.\nAcknowledgement\nI would like to thank all my colleagues at my home institute (Drs.
