In the 17th century, at the end of his book,\nTreatise on Maxima and Minima, the French mathematician Fermat (1601\u20131665) posed an\noptimization problem which asks for a point that minimizes the sum of the distances to\nthree given points in the plane. This problem was solved by the Italian mathematician and\nphysicist Torricelli (1608\u20131647) and is called the Fermat-Torricelli problem. These problems remain active as they are mathematically beautiful and have meaningful real-world\napplications; see, e.g., [1, 2, 4, 9, 16, 18, 19] and the references therein.\nLet X be a normed space, and let F \u2282 X be a closed, bounded, convex set which\ncontains the origin as an interior point. For a point x \u2208 X and r \u2265 0, the extended ball\nwith center at x and radius r is defined by\nDF (x; r) := x + rF.\nIt is obvious that when F is the closed unit ball of X, the extended ball DF (x; r) reduces\nto the closed ball of radius r centered at x.\nIn the light of modern mathematics, we are going to study the following problem called\n1\n\nFariborz Maseeh Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Portland State University, Portland, OR\n97202, United States (email: mau.nam.nguyen@pdx.edu).

The research of Nguyen Hoang was partially supported by the NAFOSTED, Vietnam, under grant # 101.01-2011.26.\n\n1\n\n\fthe generalized Sylvester problem: given two finite collections of sets and a constraint set\nin a normed space, find an extended ball whose center lies in a given constraint set with\nthe smallest radius that encloses all the sets in the first collection and intersects all the sets\nin the second one. We also introduce and study the following generalized version of the\nclassical Fermat-Torricelli problem called the generalized Fermat-Torricelli problem: given\ntwo finite collections of sets in a normed space, find a point in a given constraint set that\nminimizes the sum of farthest distances the to the sets in the first collection and shortest\ndistances (distances) to the sets in the second collection.\nGiven a finite collection of nonempty, closed, bounded target sets {\u03a9i : i \u2208 I} and\nanother finite collection of nonempty, closed target sets (not necessarily bounded) {\u0398j : j \u2208\nJ}, and given a nonempty, closed constraint set S, the generalized Sylvester problem asks\nfor a point x \u2208 S and the smallest r \u2265 0 such that\n\u03a9i \u2282 DF (x; r) for all i \u2208 I, and DF (x; r) \u2229 \u0398j 6= \u2205 for all j \u2208 J.\nIn the case I = \u2205, this problem reduces to the smallest intersecting ball problem, and in the\ncase J = \u2205, it reduces to the smallest enclosing ball problem; see [11, 14]. It is also clear that\nwhen X is the Euclidean plane R2 , all of the target sets under consideration are singletons,\nand the constraint set S = R2 , the generalized Sylvester problem becomes the classical\nSylvester enclosing circle problem. Reducing to one of the simplest cases where three target\nsets are three Euclidean balls in R2 , and the constraint set S = R2 , we have shown in [14]\nthat the solution of the smallest intersecting ball problem has a close connection to the\nsolution of a particular case of the problem of Apollonius on tangent circles; see, e.g., [7].\nIt is interesting and not hard to see that the generalized Sylvester considered in this paper\nhas a closed connection to the other cases of this celebrated problem.\nFollowing [11], for a nonempty, closed, bounded set Q \u2282 X, we define the maximal time\nfunction to the target set Q with the constant dynamic F as follows:\nCF (x; Q) := inf{t \u2265 0 : Q \u2282 x + tF }.\n\n(1.1)\n\nThe minimal time function counterpart is defined below as:\nTF (x; Q) := inf{t \u2265 0 : (x + tF ) \u2229 Q 6= \u2205},\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere Q needs not necessarily be bounded.\nRecall that the Minkowski function associated with F is defined by\n\u03c1F (x) := inf{t \u2265 0 : x \u2208 tF }.\nThe maximal time function (1.1) and the minimal time function (1.2) are Lipschitz\ncontinuous and can be represented as\nCF (x; Q) = sup{\u03c1F (q \u2212 x) : q \u2208 Q} and TF (x; Q) = inf{\u03c1F (q \u2212 x) : q \u2208 Q}.\nSince \u03c1F (x) = kxk when F is the closed unit ball of X, in this case, the maximal time\nfunction (1.1) reduces to the farthest distance function\nM (x; Q) := sup{kx \u2212 qk : q \u2208 Q},\n2\n\n\fand the minimal time function (1.2) reduces to the distance function\nd(x; Q) := inf{kx \u2212 qk : q \u2208 Q}.\nIn order to model the generalized Sylvester problem, we introduce the following function:\nG(x) := max{CF (x; \u03a9i ), TF (x; \u0398j ) : i \u2208 I, j \u2208 J},\nand consider the following optimization problem\nminimize G(x) subject to x \u2208 S.\n\n(1.3)\n\nThe generalized Fermat-Torricelli problem can also be modeled as the following optimization\nproblem:\nX\nX\nminimize H(x) :=\nCF (x; \u03a9i ) +\nTF (x; \u0398j ) subject to x \u2208 S.\n(1.4)\ni\u2208I\n\nj\u2208J\n\nIn this paper, we will mainly study the existence and uniqueness of optimal solutions to the\noptimization problems (1.3) and (1.4) in general normed spaces. The existence results will\nbe studied in Section 2 and the uniqueness results will be studied in Section 3. Our results\ngeneralize those obtained in [11, 12, 13, 14] and related references therein.\nWe are going to use the following standing assumptions throughout the paper:\nX is a normed space; F is a closed, bounded, convex set that contains 0 as an interior point;\n\u03a9i is nonempty, closed, bounded for every i \u2208 I; \u0398j is nonempty, closed for every j \u2208 J; S\nis a nonempty, closed set; and I \u222a J 6= \u2205.\n\n2\n\nThe Generalized Sylvester Problem and the Generalized\nFermat-Torricelli Problem: the Existence of\nOptimal Solutions\n\nIn this section, we will study sufficient conditions that guarantee the existence of optimal\nsolutions to the optimization problems (1.3) and (1.4).\nLemma 2.1 For \u03b1 > 0, the level sets\nV\u03b1 := {x \u2208 S : G(x) < \u03b1}, W\u03b1 := {x \u2208 S : H(x) < \u03b1}\nand\nL\u03b1 := {x \u2208 S : G(x) \u2264 \u03b1}, K\u03b1 := {x \u2208 S : H(x) \u2264 \u03b1}\nhave the following estimates\n\u0002\n\u0003 \u0002\n\u0003\nV\u03b1 \u2282 S \u2229 \u2229i\u2208I \u2229\u03c9\u2208\u03a9i (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b1F ) \u2229 \u2229j\u2208J (\u0398j \u2212 \u03b1F ) \u2282 L\u03b1 ,\nand\n\u0002\n\u0003 \u0002\n\u0003\nW\u03b1 \u2282 S \u2229 \u2229i\u2208I \u2229\u03c9\u2208\u03a9i (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b1F ) \u2229 \u2229j\u2208J (\u0398j \u2212 \u03b1F ) \u2282 Km\u03b1 ,\nwhere m = |I| + |J|.\n3\n\n\fProof: Fix any x \u2208 V\u03b1 . It is obvious that x \u2208 S and the following hold for all i \u2208 I and\nfor all j \u2208 J:\nCF (x; \u03a9i ) < \u03b1 and TF (x; \u0398j ) < \u03b1.\nFrom the condition CF (x; \u03a9i ) < \u03b1, one sees easily that\n\u03a9i \u2282 x + \u03b1F.\nThus,\nx \u2208 \u2229\u03c9\u2208\u03a9i (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b1F ).\nSimilarly, from the condition TF (x; \u0398j ) < \u03b1, one finds 0 \u2264 t < \u03b1\n\u0398j \u2229 (x + tF ) 6= \u2205.\nSince F is convex and 0 \u2208 F , this implies\nx \u2208 \u0398j \u2212 tF \u2282 \u0398j \u2212 \u03b1F.\nNow fix any x \u2208 S such that\n\u0003 \u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\nx \u2208 \u2229i\u2208I \u2229\u03c9\u2208\u03a9i (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b1F ) \u2229 \u2229j\u2208J (\u0398j \u2212 \u03b1F ) .\nThen\n\u03a9i \u2282 x + \u03b1F for all i \u2208 I, and (x + \u03b1F ) \u2229 \u0398j 6= \u2205 for all j \u2208 J.\nIt follows that CF (x; \u03a9i ) \u2264 \u03b1 for all i \u2208 I, and TF (x; \u0398j ) \u2264 \u03b1 for all j \u2208 J. Thus, G(x) \u2264 \u03b1,\nand hence x \u2208 L\u03b1 . The first estimates have been proved. The second estimates can be\nproved in the same way. The proof is now complete.\n\u0003\nLemma 2.2 Let X be a reflexive Banach space. Suppose \u0398j is weakly closed for every\nj \u2208 J. Then G and H are weakly sequentially lower semicontinuous.\nProof: We will only show that G is weakly sequentially lower semicontinuous since the\nproof for H is similar. Fix any sequence (xk ) that converges weakly to x\u0304. We will show that\nlim inf G(xk ) \u2265 G(x\u0304).\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nWithout loss of generality, suppose\nlim inf G(xk ) = \u03b3 \u2208 R.\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nThen there exists a subsequence of (xk ) (without relabeling) such that\nlim G(xk ) = \u03b3.\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nFor any \u03b5 > 0, there exists k0 \u2208 N such that for any k \u2265 k0 and for any i \u2208 I, j \u2208 J, one\nhas\nCF (xk ; \u03a9i ) < \u03b3 + \u03b5 and TF (xk ; \u0398j ) < \u03b3 + \u03b5.\n4\n\n\fIt follows that for any k \u2265 k0 and for any i \u2208 I, j \u2208 J, the following hold:\n\u03a9i \u2282 xk + (\u03b3 + \u03b5)F and (xk + (\u03b3 + \u03b5)F ) \u2229 \u0398j 6= \u2205.\nThe first inclusion implies\n\u03a9i \u2282 x\u0304 + (\u03b3 + \u03b5)F.\nSince X is reflexive, the set F is a weakly sequentially compact. Thus, the second condition\nimplies (x\u0304 + (\u03b3 + \u03b5)F ) \u2229 \u0398j 6= \u2205 under the assumption that \u0398j is weakly closed for every\nj \u2208 J. It follows that\nG(x\u0304) = max{CF (x\u0304; \u03a9i ), TF (x\u0304; \u0398j ) : i \u2208 I, j \u2208 J} \u2264 \u03b3 + \u03b5.\nSince \u03b5 > 0 is arbitrary, G(x\u0304) \u2264 \u03b3, and the proof is now complete.\n\n\u0003\n\nLet us define\n\u0002\n\u0003 \u0002\n\u0003\nN (I, J, \u03b1) := S \u2229 \u2229i\u2208I \u2229\u03c9\u2208\u03a9i (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b1F ) \u2229 \u2229j\u2208J (\u0398j \u2212 \u03b1F ) .\n\nProposition 2.3 The optimization problem (1.3) has a nonempty optimal solution set under one of the following assumptions:\n(i) There exists \u03b1 > 0 such that N (I, J, \u03b1) is nonempty and precompact.\n(ii) X is a reflexive Banach space; S and \u0398j for j \u2208 J are weakly closed; and there exists\n\u03b1 > 0 such that N (I, J, \u03b1) is nonempty and bounded.\nProof: We only need to prove the existence of an optimal solution for (1.3). The proof\nof the existence of an optimal solution under (i) is straightforward since G is Lipschitz\ncontinuous; see, e.g., [11]. Let us give the detail of the proof for the existence of an optimal\nsolution under (ii). Let (xk ) \u2282 S be a minimizing sequence for the optimization problem\n(1.3). Since N (I, J, \u03b1) 6= \u2205, and N (I, J, \u03b1) \u2282 L\u03b1 , by Lemma 2.1,\ninf{G(x) : x \u2208 S} \u2264 \u03b1.\nIn the case inf{G(x) : x \u2208 S} = \u03b1, we see that any x \u2208 N (I, J, \u03b1) is an optimal solution of\nthe problem. In the other case,\nG(xk ) < \u03b1.\nfor all sufficiently large k. Thus, xk \u2208 N (I, J, \u03b1) for such k, so (xk ) is bounded. Since X is\nreflexive and S is weakly closed, (xk ) has a subsequence (without relabeling) that converges\nweakly to x\u0304 \u2208 S. Since the target sets \u0398j for j \u2208 J are also weakly closed, by Lemma 2.2,\nG(x\u0304) \u2264 lim inf G(xk ) = inf{G(x) : x \u2208 S}.\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nTherefore, x\u0304 is an optimal solution of the problem. The proof is now complete.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe proof of the following proposition, with a slight difference in formulation compared\nwith Proposition 2.3, is also straightforward.\n5\n\n\fProposition 2.4 The optimization problem (1.4) has a nonempty optimal solution set under one of the following assumptions:\n(i) There exists \u03b1 > inf{H(x) : x \u2208 S} such that N (I, J, \u03b1) is precompact.\n(ii) X is a reflexive Banach space; S and \u0398j for j \u2208 J are weakly closed; and there exists\n\u03b1 > inf{H(x) : x \u2208 S} such that N (I, J, \u03b1) is bounded.\nTheorem 2.5 The optimization problem (1.3) and (1.4) have nonempty optimal solution\nsets under one of the following assumptions:\n(i) The constraint set S is compact.\n(ii) I 6= \u2205 and X is finite dimensional.\n(iii) J 6= \u2205, at least one of the sets among {\u0398j : j \u2208 J} is compact, and X is finite\ndimensional.\n(iv) X is a reflexive Banach space; S and \u0398j for j \u2208 J are weakly closed; and at least one\nof them is bounded.\nProof: We will only prove the existence of an optimal solution for (1.3). Fix any\n\u03b1 > inf{G(x) : x \u2208 S}. Then N (I, J, \u03b1) 6= \u2205. We will show that assumption (i) of\nProposition 2.3 is satisfied under one of the assumptions: (i), (ii), and (iii) in this theorem.\nSuppose (i) is satisfied. Then the set N (I, J, \u03b1) is precompact since it is a subset of S. In\nthe case where (ii) is satisfied. Fix i0 \u2208 I and \u03c90 \u2208 \u03a9i0 . Then\nN (I, J, \u03b1) \u2282 \u03c90 \u2212 \u03b1F.\nThis also implies that N (I, J, \u03b1) is precompact since \u03c90 \u2212 \u03b1F is compact in this case. Now\nsuppose that (iii) is satisfied. Choose j0 \u2208 J such that \u0398j0 is compact. Then, again,\nN (I, J, \u03b1) is precompact since N (I, J, \u03b1) \u2282 \u0398j0 \u2212 \u03b1F and the latter is compact in this case.\nTo finish the proof, we will show that condition (ii) of Proposition 2.3 is satisfied under\ncondition (iv) of this theorem. If J = \u2205, then S is bounded, so N (I, J, \u03b1) \u2282 S is bounded.\nIn the case J 6= \u2205, it is also easy to see that N (I, J, \u03b1) is bounded. The proof is now\ncomplete.\n\u0003\nFinally, we will study the relationship between the optimization problem (1.3) and the\ngeneralized Sylvester problem in the proposition below.\nProposition 2.6 Let X be a reflexive Banach space. Suppose that \u0398j is weakly closed for\nevery j \u2208 J. Then x\u0304 is an optimal solution of the generalized Sylvester problem with radius\nr if and only if x\u0304 is an optimal solution of the optimization problem (1.3) with r = G(x\u0304).\nProof: Let x\u0304 \u2208 S be an optimal solution of the generalized Sylvester problem with the\nsmallest radius r \u2265 0. Then\n\u03a9i \u2282 x\u0304 + rF for all i \u2208 I, and \u0398j \u2229 (x\u0304 + rF ) 6= \u2205 for all j \u2208 J.\nMoreover, for any x \u2208 S and t \u2265 0 such that\n\u03a9i \u2282 x + tF for all i \u2208 I, and \u0398j \u2229 (x + tF ) 6= \u2205 for all j \u2208 J,\n6\n\n\fone has r \u2264 t. We will show that G(x\u0304) = r and G(x\u0304) \u2264 G(x) for all x \u2208 S.\nSince\n\u03a9i \u2282 x\u0304 + rF for all i \u2208 I, and \u0398j \u2229 (x\u0304 + rF ) 6= \u2205 for all j \u2208 J,\none has G(x\u0304) \u2264 r.\nSince 0 \u2208 F and F is convex, t1 F \u2282 t2 F whenever 0 \u2264 t1 \u2264 t2 . If G(x\u0304) < r, take r \u2032 > 0\nsuch that G(x\u0304) < r \u2032 < r. Then\n\u03a9i \u2282 x\u0304 + r \u2032 F for all i \u2208 I, and (x\u0304 + r \u2032 F ) \u2229 \u0398j 6= \u2205 for all j \u2208 J.\nThis contradicts to the definition of an optimal solution of the generalized Sylvester problem.\nNow fix any x \u2208 S and define r \u2032 := G(x). It is not hard to see that\n\u03a9i \u2282 x\u0304 + r \u2032 F for all i \u2208 I, and (x\u0304 + r \u2032 F ) \u2229 \u0398j 6= \u2205 for all j \u2208 J.\nThus, G(x\u0304) = r \u2264 r \u2032 = G(x).\nConversely, suppose that x\u0304 \u2208 S is a solution of the optimal problem (1.3). Then\nG(x\u0304) = min G(x) = r.\nx\u2208S\n\nThus,\nCF (x\u0304, \u03a9i ) \u2264 r for all i \u2208 I, and TF (x\u0304, \u0398j ) \u2264 r for all j \u2208 J.\nConsequently,\n\u03a9i \u2282 x\u0304 + rF for all i \u2208 I, and \u0398j \u2229 (x\u0304 + rF ) 6= \u2205 for all j \u2208 J.\nNow, take x \u2208 S and t \u2265 0 such that\n\u03a9i \u2282 x + tF for all i \u2208 I and \u0398j \u2229 (x + tF ) 6= \u2205 for all j \u2208 J.\nLet r \u2032 = G(x). Then r \u2264 r \u2032 \u2264 t. This means x\u0304 is an optimal solution of the generalized\nSylvester problem.\n\u0003\n\n3\n\nThe Generalized Sylvester Problem and the Generalized\nFermat-Torricelli Problem: the Uniqueness of\nOptimal Solutions\n\nWe are first going to study the uniqueness of an optimal solution to the optimization problem\n(1.3). Recall that a set C is called convex if for every x, y \u2208 C, one has\n[x, y] := {tx + (1 \u2212 t)y : t \u2208 [0, 1]} \u2282 C.\nThe set C is called strictly convex if for every x, y \u2208 C, x 6= y, and for every t \u2208 (0, 1), one\nhas\ntx + (1 \u2212 t)y \u2208 int C.\n\n7\n\n\fA function f is called convex on a convex set S if for every x, y \u2208 S and for every t \u2208 (0, 1),\none has\nf (tx + (1 \u2212 t)y) \u2264 tf (x) + (1 \u2212 t)f (y).\nIf this inequality becomes strict for all x, y \u2208 S, x 6= y, and for every t \u2208 (0, 1), the function\nis called strictly convex.\nThe following lemma is useful in the sequel. It is also of independent interest.\nLemma 3.1 Let S be convex. Suppose g is a nonnegative, convex function on S. Then the\nfunction defined by\nh(x) := (g(x))2\nis strictly convex if and only if g is not constant on any line segment [a, b] \u2282 S, where a 6= b.\nProof: Suppose h is strictly convex on S. On the contrary, suppose that g is constant on\na line segment [a, b], where a 6= b. Then h is also constant on this line segment, which is a\ncontradiction.\nConversely, suppose g is not constant on any line segment [a, b] \u2282 S , where a 6= b. For\nany t \u2208 (0, 1) and for any x, y \u2208 S, one has\nh(tx + (1 \u2212 t)y) = (g(tx + (1 \u2212 t)y))2 \u2264 (tg(x) + (1 \u2212 t)g(y))2\n= t2 (g(x))2 + (1 \u2212 t)2 (g(y))2 + 2t(1 \u2212 t)g(x)g(y)\n\u2264 t2 (g(x))2 + (1 \u2212 t)2 (g(y))2 + t(1 \u2212 t)((g(x))2 + (g(y))2 )\n= t(g(x))2 + (1 \u2212 t)(g(y))2 = th(x) + (1 \u2212 t)h(y).\nThus, h is a convex function on S. We will show that it is strictly convex on S. Suppose\nby contradiction that there exist t \u2208 (0, 1) and x, y \u2208 S such that\nh(z) = th(x) + (1 \u2212 t)h(y),\nwhere z := tx + (1 \u2212 t)y. Then\n(g(z))2 = t(g(x))2 + (1 \u2212 t)(g(y))2 .\nSince g(z) \u2264 tg(x) + (1 \u2212 t)g(y), one has\n(g(z))2 \u2264 t2 (g(x))2 + (1 \u2212 t)2 (g(y))2 + 2t(1 \u2212 t)g(x)g(y).\nThis implies\nt(g(x))2 + (1 \u2212 t)(g(y))2 \u2264 t2 (g(x))2 + (1 \u2212 t)2 (g(y))2 + 2t(1 \u2212 t)g(x)g(y).\nThus, (g(x) \u2212 g(y))2 \u2264 0, and hence g(x) = g(y). We have proved that h(x) = h(z) = h(y),\nwhere z \u2208 (x, y). We will get a contradiction by showing that h is constant on the line\nsegment [z, y]. Indeed, fix any u \u2208 (z, y). Then\nh(u) \u2264 \u03bdh(z) + (1 \u2212 \u03bd)h(y) = h(z) for some \u03bd \u2208 (0, 1).\n8\n\n\fOn the other hand, since z lies in between x and u, one has\nh(z) \u2264 \u03bch(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bc)h(u) \u2264 \u03bch(z) + (1 \u2212 \u03bc)h(z) = h(z) for some \u03bc \u2208 (0, 1).\nThus, h(z) = \u03bch(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bc)h(u) = \u03bch(z) + (1 \u2212 \u03bc)h(u), and hence h(u) = h(z). This\np\ncontradicts to the assumption that g(u) = h(u) is not constant on any line segment [a, b],\nwhere a 6= b. The proof is now complete.\n\u0003\nGiven a nonempty, closed, bounded subset \u03a9 of X and a point x \u2208 X, the farthest\nprojection from x to \u03a9 is defined by\nPF (x; \u03a9) := {\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 : \u03c1F (\u03c9 \u2212 x) = CF (x; \u03a9)}.\nProposition 3.2 Suppose F is strictly convex. Let \u03a9 be a nonempty, closed, bounded\nsubset of X such that PF (x; \u03a9) 6= \u2205 for all x \u2208 S, where S is convex. Then the function\nh(x) := CF (x; \u03a9) is convex and not constant on any straight line segment [a, b] \u2282 S, where\na 6= b.\nProof: The function h is obviously convex on S since it is the supremum of a family of\nconvex functions by the representation\nCF (x; \u03a9) = sup{\u03c1F (\u03c9 \u2212 x) : \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9}.\nSuppose by contradiction that h(x) = r for all x \u2208 [a, b] \u2282 S for some line segment [a, b],\na+b\n; \u03a9). Then\nwhere a 6= b. Let \u03c9 \u2208 PF (\n2\nr = h(\n\na+b\na+b\n) = \u03c1F (\u03c9 \u2212\n).\n2\n2\n\nIt follows that\nr = \u03c1F (\n\n1\n1\n1\n\u03c9\u2212a \u03c9\u2212b\n+\n) \u2264 \u03c1F (\u03c9 \u2212 a) + \u03c1F (\u03c9 \u2212 b) \u2264 (CF (a; \u03a9) + CF (b; \u03a9)) = r.\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\nSince r = CF (a; \u03a9) \u2265 \u03c1F (\u03c9 \u2212 a) and r = CF (b; \u03a9) \u2265 \u03c1F (\u03c9 \u2212 b),\n\u03c1F (\u03c9 \u2212 a) = \u03c1F (\u03c9 \u2212 b) = r.\nSince r > 0, this implies\n\u03c1F (\nThus,\n\n\u03c9\u2212a\n\u03c9\u2212b\n) = \u03c1F (\n) = 1.\nr\nr\n\n\u03c9\u2212b\n\u03c9\u2212a\n\u2208 F and\n\u2208 F .

The proof is now complete.\n\n\u0003\n\nFor a nonempty, closed subset \u0398 of X and x \u2208 X, the projection from x to \u0398 is defined\nby\n\u03a0F (x; \u0398) := {u \u2208 \u0398 : \u03c1F (u \u2212 x) = TF (x; \u0398)}.\nIt is not hard to see that \u03a0F (x; \u0398) 6= \u2205 for all x \u2208 X under one of the following conditions:\n(i) \u0398 is compact.\n(ii) X is finite dimensional and \u0398 is closed.\n(iii) X is reflexive and \u0398 is weakly closed.\nProposition 3.3 Suppose F is strictly convex. Let \u0398 be a nonempty, closed, strictly convex\nset of X. Suppose further that the set \u03a0F (x, \u0398) is nonempty for all x \u2208 S, where S is a\nconvex set. Then the function g(x) = TF (x, \u0398) is convex and not constant on any line\nsegment [a, b] \u2282 S such that a 6= b and [a, b] \u2229 \u0398 = \u2205.\nProof: It is easy to see that g(x) is convex on S. Observe that if u \u2208 \u03a0F (x; \u0398), where\nx\u2208\n/ \u0398, then u \u2208 bd \u0398.

Choose u \u2208 \u03a0F (a; \u0398) and v \u2208 \u03a0F (b; \u0398). Then\n\u03c1F (u \u2212 a) = \u03c1F (v \u2212 b) = r.\nWe will first show that u 6= v. Indeed, if u = v, then\n\u03c1F (u \u2212 a) = \u03c1F (u \u2212 b) = r.\nFollowing the proof of Lemma 3.2, one has\n\u03c1F (u \u2212\nand hence\nTF (\n\na+b\n) < r,\n2\n\na+b\na+b\n; \u0398) \u2264 \u03c1F (u \u2212\n) < r,\n2\n2\n\nwhich is not the case.\nFor a fixed t \u2208 (0, 1), one has\nr = TF (ta + (1 \u2212 t)b; \u0398) \u2264 \u03c1F (tu + (1 \u2212 t)v \u2212 (ta + (1 \u2212 t)b))\n\u2264 t\u03c1F (u \u2212 a) + (1 \u2212 t)\u03c1F (v \u2212 b) = r.\nThis implies tu+(1\u2212t)v \u2208 \u03a0F (ta+(1\u2212t)b; \u0398). Thus, tu+(1\u2212t)v \u2208 bd \u0398. This contradicts\nthe strict convexity of \u0398. The proof is now complete.\n\u0003\n10\n\n\fLemma 3.4 Suppose that hi for i = 1, . . . , m, m \u2265 1, are nonnegative, continuous, convex\nfunctions on S, where S is convex.

Suppose that\n\u03c6(x) = max{h1 (x), h2 (x)}.\nThe conclusion is obviously true if h1 (x) = r for all x \u2208 [a, b]. Otherwise, there exists\nx0 \u2208 [a, b] such that h1 (x0 ) < r. Then there exists a subinterval [\u03b1, \u03b2] \u2282 [a, b], \u03b1 6= \u03b2, such\nthat\nh1 (x) < r for all x \u2208 [\u03b1, \u03b2].\nTherefore, h2 (x) = r on this subinterval. Suppose that the conclusion holds for a positive\ninteger m. Let \u03c6(x) = max{h1 (x), . . . , hm (x), hm+1 (x)}. Then \u03c6(x) = max{h1 (x), k1 (x)}\nwhere k1 (x) := max{h2 (x), . . . , hm+1 (x)}. The conclusion follows from the case m = 2 and\nthe induction assumption.

Then the optimization problem (1.3) has at most one optimal solution if and only if\none of the following conditions is satisfied:\n(1) The index set I is empty and \u2229j\u2208J [\u0398j \u2229 S] contains at most one point.\n(2) The index set I is nonempty.\nProof: Define\nC1 (x) := max{CF (x; \u03a9i ) : i \u2208 I}\nand\nT1 (x) := max{TF (x; \u0398j ) : j \u2208 J}.\nThen\nG(x) = max{C1 (x), T1 (x)}.\nWe also defined\nK(x) := (G(x))2 = max{(C1 (x))2 , (T1 (x))2 }.\n\n11\n\n\fConsider the optimization problem\nminimize K(x) subject to x \u2208 S.\n\n(3.1)\n\nIt is obvious that x\u0304 \u2208 S is an optimal solution of problem (1.3) if and only if it is an optimal\nsolution to problem (3.1). We are going to prove that K is strictly convex on S under (1)\nor (2).\nSuppose first that (1) is satisfied. In this case, it suffices to show that \u03c6(x) := (T1 (x))2\nis strictly convex on the set S. By contradiction, suppose \u03c6 is not strictly convex on S. By\nLemma 3.1, there exists a line segment [a, b] \u2282 S, a 6= b, and r \u2265 0 such that\nT1 (x) = max{TF (x; \u0398j ) : j \u2208 J} = r for all x \u2208 [a, b].\nIt is clear that r > 0, since otherwise, [a, b] \u2282 \u2229j\u2208J \u0398j , which is a contradiction since\n\u2229j\u2208J [\u0398j \u2229 S] contains at most one point. By Lemma 3.4, there exists a line segment\n[\u03b1, \u03b2] \u2282 [a, b], \u03b1 6= \u03b2, and j0 \u2208 J such that\nTF (x; \u0398j0 ) = r for all x \u2208 [\u03b1, \u03b2].\nSince r > 0, x \u2208\n/ \u0398j0 for all x \u2208 [\u03b1, \u03b2]. Thus, [\u03b1, \u03b2] \u2229 \u0398j0 = \u2205. This is a contradiction to\nProposition 3.3.\nNow, let us assume that (2) is satisfied. We will show that K is also strictly convex on\nS in this case. Again, by contradiction, suppose K is not strictly convex on S. By Lemma\n3.1, there exists a line segment [a, b] \u2282 S, a 6= b, and r \u2265 0 such that\nG(x) = max{C1 (x), T1 (x)} = r for all x \u2208 [a, b].\nIn the case where r = 0, one has C1 (x) = 0 for all x \u2208 [a, b]. Thus, for any i \u2208 I, one has\nCF (x; \u00d8i ) = 0 for all x \u2208 [a, b]. In this case \u00d8i must be a singleton and that contains x\nfor all x \u2208 [a, b], which is not the case. In the case where r > 0, by Lemma 3.4, one of the\nfollowing holds:\n(a) There exist a line segment [\u03b1, \u03b2] \u2282 [a, b], \u03b1 6= \u03b2, and j0 \u2208 J such that\nTF (x; \u0398j0 ) = r for all x \u2208 [\u03b1, \u03b2].\n(b) There exist a line segment [\u03b1, \u03b2] \u2282 [a, b], \u03b1 6= \u03b2, and i0 \u2208 I such that\nCF (x; \u03a9i0 ) = r for all x \u2208 [\u03b1, \u03b2].\nIf (a) holds, then we arrive at a contradiction to Proposition 3.3 in the same way as the\nprevious proof. In the case (b) holds, we also arrive at a contradiction to Proposition 3.2.\nWe have shown that the function K is strictly convex on S, and hence problem (1.3) has at\nmost one optimal solution.\nLet us now show that if problem (1.3) has at most one solution, then either (1) or (2)\nis satisfied. Suppose by contradiction that both conditions are not satisfied (notice that\n(1) and (2) cannot occur simultaneously). Then index set I = \u2205 and \u2229j\u2208J [\u0398j \u2229 S] contains\nmore than one points. It clear that \u2229j\u2208J [\u0398j \u2229 S] is the solution set of the problem in this\n12\n\n\fcase with the optimal value zero. Thus, the problem has more than one solution, which is\na contradiction. The proof is now complete.\n\u0003\nTheorem 3.5 generalizes the sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of optimal solutions\nfor the smallest enclosing ball problem and the smallest intersecting ball problem given in\n[11].\nThe next two corollaries follow directly from Theorem 3.5.\nCorollary 3.6 Let F be a strictly convex set, let S be convex, and let I 6= \u2205, J 6= \u2205.\n(i) Suppose that for every x \u2208 S, the projection set PF (x; \u03a9i ) is nonempty for all i \u2208 I.\nThen the optimization problem\nminimize C1 (x) = max{CF (x; \u03a9i ) : i \u2208 I} subject to x \u2208 S\nhas at most one optimal solution.\n(ii) Suppose that \u0398j is strictly convex for every j \u2208 J, and for every x \u2208 S, the projection\nset \u03a0F (x, \u0398j ) is nonempty for all j \u2208 J. Then the optimization problem\nminimize T1 (x) = max{TF (x; \u0398j ) : j \u2208 J} subject to x \u2208 S\nhas at most one optimal solution if and only if \u2229j\u2208J [\u0398j \u2229 S] contains at most one point.\nIt seems that our results are new even when reducing to the simple case below.\nCorollary 3.7 Suppose F is strictly convex and S is convex. For any finite collection of\npoints {ai : i = 1, . . . , m}, m \u2265 1, the optimization\nminimize max{\u03c1F (ai \u2212 x) : i = 1, . . . , m} subject to x \u2208 S\nhas at most one optimal solution. This problem has a unique optimal solution if we assume\nadditionally that X is reflexive or S is compact.\nRecall that X is called strictly convex if the closed unit ball of X is a strictly convex\nset. It is well-known that X is strictly convex if and only if the following implication holds:\n[x 6= y and kxk = kyk = 1] \u21d2 kx + yk < 2.\nThere are several examples of strictly convex normed spaces such as Hilbert spaces and Lp\nspaces for p > 1.\nThe following corollary follows directly from Theorem 3.5.\nCorollary 3.8 Let \u0398j be strictly convex for every j \u2208 J and let S be convex. Suppose\nthat X is strictly convex and F is the closed unit ball of X. Suppose further that for every\nx \u2208 S, the projection sets PF (x; \u03a9i ) and \u03a0(x, \u0398j ) are nonempty for all i \u2208 I and j \u2208 J.\nThen the optimization problem (1.3) has at most one optimal solution if and only if I 6= \u2205\nor \u2229j\u2208J [\u0398j \u2229 S] contains at most one point.\n\n13\n\n\fWe are now going to study the uniqueness of an optimal solution to the optimization\nproblem (1.4). The following lemma will be important for the study. It generalizes a familiar\nproperty of the norm on a strictly convex normed space.\nLemma 3.9 Suppose F is strictly convex. If x 6= 0 and y 6= 0, then\n\u03c1F (x + y) = \u03c1F (x) + \u03c1F (y)\n\n(3.2)\n\nif and only if x = \u03bby for some \u03bb > 0.\nProof: Let \u03b1 := \u03c1F (x) and \u03b2 := \u03c1F (y). Since F is bounded, \u03b1 > 0 and \u03b2 > 0. From (3.2),\none has\nx+y\n\u03c1F (\n) = 1.\n\u03b1+\u03b2\nThis implies\ny \u03b2\nx \u03b1\n+\n) = 1.\n\u03c1F (\n\u03b1\u03b1+\u03b2\n\u03b2\u03b1+\u03b2\nThus,\nx \u03b1\ny \u03b2\n+\n\u2208 bd F.\n\u03b1\u03b1+\u03b2 \u03b2\u03b1+\u03b2\ny\n\u03b1\nx\n\u2208 (0, 1), the strict convexity of F implies\nSince \u2208 F , \u2208 F , and\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1+\u03b2\nx\ny\n= .\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\nIt follows that x = \u03bby for \u03bb :=\nnow complete.\n\n\u03c1F (x)\n. The opposite implication is obvious. The proof is\n\u03c1F (y)\n\u0003\n\nLemma 3.10 Suppose F is strictly convex and \u0398 is convex. Then for any x \u2208 X, the set\n\u03a0F (x; \u0398) cannot contain more than one points.\nProof: We only need to consider the case where x \u2208\n/ \u0398. Suppose by contradiction that\nthere exist u1 , u2 \u2208 \u03a0F (x; \u0398) and u1 6= u2 . Then\nTF (x; \u0398) = \u03c1F (u1 \u2212 x) = \u03c1F (u2 \u2212 x) = r > 0.\nThis implies\n\nu1 \u2212 x\nu2 \u2212 x\n\u2208 F and\n\u2208 F . Since F is strictly convex,\nr\nr\n\n1 u1 + u2\n1 u1 \u2212 x 1 u2 \u2212 x\n+\n= (\n\u2212 x) \u2208 int F.\n2 r\n2 r\nr\n2\nu1 + u2\nIt follows that \u03c1F (u \u2212 x) < r = TF (x; \u0398), where u =\n\u2208 \u0398. This is a contradiction.\n2\n\u0003\nIn what follows, we identify the projection \u03a0F (x; \u0398) with its unique element when F\nand \u0398 are strictly convex.\nFor two different points x and y in X, define\nL(x, y) := {tx + (1 \u2212 t)y : t \u2208 R}.\n14\n\n\fProposition 3.11 Let F be strictly convex, let I 6= \u2205, and let S be convex. Suppose that\nfor any x, y \u2208 S, x 6= y, there exists i \u2208 I such that\nL(x, y) \u2229 \u03a9i = \u2205.\nUnder the assumption that for every x \u2208 X, the projection set PF (x; \u03a9i ) 6= \u2205 for all i \u2208 I,\nthe function\nX\nC2 (x) :=\nCF (x; \u03a9i )\ni\u2208I\n\nis strictly convex on S.\nProof: Suppose by contradiction that C2 is not strictly convex on S. Then there exist\nx, y \u2208 S, x 6= y, and t \u2208 (0, 1) such that\nC2 (tx + (1 \u2212 t)y) = tC2 (x) + (1 \u2212 t)C2 (y).\nThis implies\nCF (tx + (1 \u2212 t)y; \u03a9i ) = tCF (x; \u03a9i ) + (1 \u2212 t)CF (y; \u03a9i ) for all i \u2208 I.\n\n(3.3)\n\nChoose i0 \u2208 I such that\nL(x, y) \u2229 \u03a9i0 = \u2205.\nFor any \u03c9 \u2208 PF (tx + (1 \u2212 t)y; \u03a9i0 ), one has\nCF (tx + (1 \u2212 t)y; \u03a9i0 ) = \u03c1F (\u03c9 \u2212 (tx + (1 \u2212 t)y)\n= \u03c1F (t(\u03c9 \u2212 x) + (1 \u2212 t)(\u03c9 \u2212 y))\n\u2264 t\u03c1F (\u03c9 \u2212 x) + (1 \u2212 t)\u03c1F (\u03c9 \u2212 y)\n\u2264 tCF (x; \u03a9i0 ) + (1 \u2212 t)CF (y; \u03a9i0 ).\nThe equality (3.3) implies\n\u03c1F (t(\u03c9\u2212x)+(1\u2212t)(\u03c9\u2212y)) = t\u03c1F (\u03c9\u2212x)+(1\u2212t)\u03c1F (\u03c9\u2212y) = \u03c1F (t(\u03c9\u2212x))+\u03c1F ((1\u2212t)(\u03c9\u2212y)).\nSince x, y \u2208\n/ \u03a9i0 , one has \u03c9 \u2212 x, \u03c9 \u2212 y 6= 0, and hence, by Lemma 3.9, there exists \u03bb > 0\nsuch that\nt(\u03c9 \u2212 x) = \u03bb(1 \u2212 t)(\u03c9 \u2212 y).\nThis implies\n\u03c9 \u2212 x = \u03b3(\u03c9 \u2212 y), where \u03b3 :=\nThus,\n\u03c9=\n\n\u03bb(1 \u2212 t)\n6= 1.\nt\n\n\u03b3\n1\nx\u2212\ny \u2208 L(x, y),\n1\u2212\u03b3\n1\u2212\u03b3\n\nwhich is a contradiction. The proof is now complete.\n\n15\n\n\u0003\n\n\fProposition 3.12 Let F and \u0398j be strictly convex for every j \u2208 J, where J 6= \u2205, and let\nS be convex. Suppose that for any x, y \u2208 S, x 6= y, there exists j \u2208 J such that\nL(x, y) \u2229 \u0398j = \u2205.\nUnder the assumption that for every x \u2208 S, the projection set \u03a0F (x; \u0398i ) 6= \u2205 for all j \u2208 J,\nthe function\nX\nT2 (x) :=\nTF (x; \u0398j )\nj\u2208J\n\nis strictly convex on S.\nProof: Suppose by contradiction that there exist x 6= y, x, y \u2208 S, and t \u2208 (0, 1) such that\nT2 (tx + (1 \u2212 t)y) = tT2 (x) + (1 \u2212 t)T2 (y).\nUsing the convexity of each TF (x; \u0398j ) for j \u2208 J, one has\nTF (tx + (1 \u2212 t)y; \u0398j ) = tTF (x; \u0398j ) + (1 \u2212 t)TF (y; \u0398j ) for all j \u2208 J.\n\n(3.4)\n\nSuppose that L(x, y) \u2229 \u0398j0 = \u2205, where j0 \u2208 J. Define\nu := \u03a0F (x; \u0398j0 ) and v := \u03a0F (y; \u0398j0 ).\nThen equation (3.4) implies\nt\u03c1F (u \u2212 x) + (1 \u2212 t)\u03c1F (v \u2212 y) = tTF (x; \u0398j0 ) + (1 \u2212 t)TF (y; \u0398j0 )\n= TF (tx + (1 \u2212 t)y; \u0398j0 )\n\u2264 \u03c1F (tu + (1 \u2212 t)v \u2212 (tx + (1 \u2212 t)y))\n\u2264 t\u03c1F (u \u2212 x) + (1 \u2212 t)\u03c1F (v \u2212 y).\nIt follows that tu + (1 \u2212 t)v = \u03a0F (tx + (1 \u2212 t)y; \u0398j0 ). This implies u = v, since otherwise,\ntu + (1 \u2212 t)v \u2208 int \u0398j0 , which is a contradiction. Thus, u = v = \u03a0F (tx + (1 \u2212 t)y; \u0398j0 ).\nEquation (3.4), again, implies\n\u03c1F (u \u2212 (tx + (1 \u2212 t)y) = \u03c1F (t(u \u2212 x) + (1 \u2212 t)(u \u2212 y)) = \u03c1F (t(u \u2212 x)) + \u03c1F ((1 \u2212 t)(u \u2212 y)).\nSince x, y \u2208\n/ \u0398j0 , one has u \u2212 x, u \u2212 y 6= 0. Following the proof of the previous proposition,\none has\nu \u2208 L(x, y),\nwhich is a contradiction. The proof is now complete.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe are now ready to establish sufficient conditions for the optimization problem (1.4)\nto have at most one optimal solution.\nTheorem 3.13 Let F and \u0398j be strictly convex for every j \u2208 J, and let S be convex.\nSuppose that for any x, y \u2208 S, x 6= y, there exists i \u2208 I such that\nL(x, y) \u2229 \u03a9i = \u2205\n16\n\n\for there exists j \u2208 J such that\nL(x, y) \u2229 \u0398j = \u2205.\nUnder the assumption that for every x \u2208 S, the projection sets PF (x; \u03a9i ) 6= \u2205 and\n\u03a0F (x; \u0398i ) 6= \u2205 for all i \u2208 I and j \u2208 J, the function H(x) defined in (1.4) is strictly convex,\nand the optimization problem (1.4) cannot have more than one solution.\nProof: We have\nH(x) := C2 (x) + T2 (x).\nWe only need to prove that H is strictly convex on S. However, this follows from the\nprevious two propositions. The proof is now complete.\n\u0003\nFinally, we state the related results for the Fermat-Torricelli problem generated by\nsingletons.\nCorollary 3.14 Suppose F is strictly convex and S is convex. For any finite collection of\npoints {ai : i = 1, . . . , m}, m \u2265 1, the optimization\nminimize\n\nm\nX\n\n\u03c1F (ai \u2212 x) subject to x \u2208 S\n\ni=1\n\nhas at most one optimal solution, provided that ai for i = 1, . . . , m are not collinear. This\nproblem has a unique optimal solution if we assume additionally that X is reflexive or S is\ncompact.\n\n4\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nIn this paper, we study generalized versions of the Sylvester problem and the FermatTorricelli problem in Banach spaces. In the case where the space is Rn with the Euclidean\nnorm, using generalized differentiation from convex analysis, it is possible to construct explicitly solutions for generalized Sylvester problems and generalized Fermat-Torricelli problem for three arbitrary balls. Solutions for the generalized Sylvester problems for three balls\nhave a close connection to the Apollonius' problem. These issues are addressed in our paper\n[15].\n\nReferences\n[1] Alonso, J., Martini, H., Spirova, M.: Minimal enclosing discs, circumcircles, and circumcenters in normed planes (Part I). Comput.
