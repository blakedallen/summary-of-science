A perturbative analysis can be used when the temperature is sufficiently high\nand the theory is weakly coupled. However, the computation of transport coefficients in\nhot gauge theories within the framework of thermal field theory remains a difficult task\ndue to the necessity of summing an infinite number of Feynman diagrams, so-called ladder\ndiagrams [1]. This has favoured the use of effective descriptions such as transport theory\n[2, 3, 4]. Another alternative is the use of lattice field theory [5], which allows one in principle\nto obtain transport coefficients at temperatures where a perturbative analysis (either with\nfield or transport theory) is not valid. This approach has not been completely developed\nand presents its own difficulties [6].\nIt is within the kinetic approach that it was first realized that screening processes in\nthe plasma at the scale of the Debye mass are enough to render results finite [2]. The first\ncomplete calculation of transport coefficients in hot gauge theories at leading logarithmic\norder appeared only recently [4], also using kinetic theory. For a scalar theory the ladder\ndiagrams have been summed explicitly by Jeon [7] using a Bethe-Salpeter equation for an\neffective vertex and the leading-order results for the shear and bulk viscosities have been\nobtained. The conclusions of his diagrammatic analysis have been confirmed in Refs. [8].\nFurthermore, Jeon and Yaffe [9] showed the equivalence between the diagrammatic and the\nkinetic approach: to leading order the linearized Boltzmann equation for the distribution\nfunction and the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the effective vertex yield equivalent results. For\nQCD, a simplified ladder summation [10] reproduces the result for the color conductivity at\nleading logarithmic order [11].\nOnly very recently a simple and economical way of summing the ladder series via a BetheSalpeter equation in the imaginary-time formalism has been presented by Valle Basagoiti [12],\nfor both scalar and (non)abelian gauge theories. To leading logarithmic order, the integral\nequations obtained in Ref. [12] are identical to those found previously in the kinetic approach [4]. However, for gauge theories the integral equations for the effective vertices used\nin Ref. [12] are not consistent with the Ward identities. In the case of the electrical conductivity in QED, which we will consider in this paper, this can be understood as follows.\nAs usual, the photon-electron vertex and the fermion propagator are related via the Ward\nidentity. A typical ladder diagram contributing to the electrical conductivity at leading logarithmic order is shown in Fig. 1. Propagators for the nearly on-shell fermions on the side rails\nwith hard momentum (p \u2261 |p| \u223c T , with T the temperature) have to include the fermionic\n2\n\n\f\u0001\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nFigure 1: Typical ladder diagram contributing to the electrical conductivity. The side rails\nare hard, nearly on-shell fermions and the rungs are soft photons.\nthermal width, such that singularities due to so-called pinching poles are regulated. This\nthermal width receives contributions from processes involving both a soft (p \u223c eT ) photon\nand a soft fermion. Ladder diagrams as the one shown in Fig. 1 can be summed by introducing an effective photon-electron vertex involving a soft photon rung [12]. One expects that\nthe Ward identity relates the contribution to the thermal width from soft photons to the\nvertex with a soft photon rung. However, the contribution to the thermal width from soft\nfermions, appearing at order e4 T ln(1/e), has no counterpart in the equation for the vertex\nfunction presented in Ref. [12]. Therefore, the Ward identity is not fulfilled and the equation\nfor the effective vertex given in Ref. [12] cannot be complete. We show in this paper that in\norder to satisfy the Ward identity a new diagram involving soft fermions has to be included,\nso that the integral equation is the one depicted in Fig. 2. As far as we know, this diagram\nhas not been discussed before.\n\n=\n\n\u0393\u03bc\n\n+\n\n!q\n\n+\n\n-k\n\u0393\u03bcHTL\n\n\u03b3\u03bc\n\n#k\n\n!q\n\np\n\np\n\n\u0393\u03bcladder\n\nFigure 2: Integral equation for the effective photon-electron vertex function \u0393\u03bc . The second\ndiagram on the right-hand-side with a hard photon and HTL vertex and fermion propagators\nis new and is required to fulfill the Ward identity.\nConcerning the electrical conductivity, however, only the real part of the effective photonelectron vertex is required. It turns out that the real part of the new diagram is parametrically suppressed with respect to the tree-level vertex. Therefore we find that the presence of\nthe vertex correction involving soft fermions does not affect the final result for the electrical\n3\n\n\fconductivity at leading logarithmic order.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we review the derivation of the electrical\nconductivity in terms of a particular analytic continuation of the effective vertex of Ref. [12].\nThe complete thermal width of order e4 T ln(1/e) for an on-shell electron with hard momentum is computed in Sec. 3. In Sec. 4 we show the consistency of the modified vertex\nequation with the Ward identity. In Sec. 5 we show that the new integral equation leads\nto the same leading-log differential equation as in Refs. [4, 12] for that piece of the effective\nvertex relevant for the electrical conductivity. Conclusions are presented in Sec. 6. We have\nsummarized convenient sum rules in Appendix A. The calculation of the new diagram is\ndetailed in Appendix B.\n\n2\n\nElectrical conductivity\n\nThe Kubo formula for the electrical conductivity in QED is\n\u03c3=\n\n1 \u2202\n\u03c1(q 0 , 0)\n0\n6 \u2202q\n\nq 0 =0\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the spectral density associated with the spatial part of the retarded polarization\ntensor\n\u03c1(q 0 , q) = 2Im \u03a0iiR (q 0 , q),\n\u03a0iiR (x \u2212 y) = i\u03b8(x0 \u2212 y 0 )h[j i (x), j i (y)]i,\n(2)\nwith j i (x) = \u03c8\u0304(x)\u03b3 i \u03c8(x) the electromagnetic current. The retarded correlator can be obtained from the Euclidean one by analytical continuation,\n\u03a0iiR (q 0 , q) = \u03a0iiE (i\u03c9q \u2192 q 0 + i0+ , q),\n\n(3)\n\nwith \u03c9q = 2\u03c0nT (n \u2208 Z) the Matsubara frequency. The relevance of ladder diagrams for the\nconductivity can be understood as follows. We start with the simple one-loop expression:\nsince in the Kubo formula (1) the correlator appears with vanishing external momentum,\nthe fermionic propagators in the one-loop expression share almost the same momentum\nand so-called pinching poles are present. They cause the one-loop contribution to diverge\nunless the thermal width is present in the electron propagators [1]. Because the dominant\ncontribution arises when the electrons are on-shell and carry hard momentum, the width is\nincluded by replacing the Dirac delta functions of the free single-particle spectral densities\nwith Lorentzian spectral functions1\n\u03c1free\n\u00b1 (\u03c9, p) = 2\u03c0\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2213 p) \u2212\u2192 \u03c1\u00b1 (\u03c9, p) =\n1\n\n(\u03c9 \u2213\n\n\u0393p\n,\n+ (\u0393p /2)2\n\np)2\n\n(4)\n\nWe assume the temperature and hence the hard fermion momentum is sufficiently high such that both\nthe zero-temperature electron mass and the real part of the fermionic self-energy can be safely neglected.\n\n4\n\n\fwhere \u0393p is the thermal width of a fermion with hard on-shell momentum. These positiveand negative-energy spectral densities are related to the electron propagator as\nZ\nd\u03c9 \u03c1\u00b1 (\u03c9, p)\n0\n0\n0\n0\nS(p , p) = \u2206+ (p , p)h+ (p\u0302) + \u2206\u2212 (p , p)h\u2212 (p\u0302),\n\u2206\u00b1 (p , p) = \u2212\n,\n(5)\n2\u03c0 p0 \u2212 \u03c9\n\nwith2\n\n\u0001 X\n1 0\nv\u03bb (p\u0302)v\u0304\u03bb (p\u0302),\n\u03b3 + \u03b3 * p\u0302 =\n2\n\u03bb\n(6)\nwhere u\u03bb (v\u03bb ) are spinors for the electron (positron) in a simultaneous chirality-helicity base\n(\u03bb = \u00b1 indicates the helicity, p\u0302 = p/p). Similarly we write the self-energy as\nh+ (p\u0302) =\n\n\u0001 X\n1 0\nu\u03bb(p\u0302)\u016b\u03bb(p\u0302),\n\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3 * p\u0302 =\n2\n\u03bb\n\nh\u2212 (p\u0302) =\n\n\u03a3(p0 , p) = \u03a3\u2212 (p0 , p)h+ (p\u0302) + \u03a3+ (p0 , p)h\u2212 (p\u0302).\n\n(7)\n\nThe use of Lorentzian spectral densities leads to fermionic propagators\n\u2206\u00b1 (z, p) =\n\n\u22121\n,\nz \u2213 p \u2212 \u03a3\u00b1 (z, p)\n\n\u03a3\u00b1 (z, p) = \u2212isgn[Im(z)]\n\n\u0393p\n.\n2\n\n(8)\n\nThis propagator has a cut on the real axis due to the discontinuity of the sign function.\nIn particular, the retarded and advanced propagators and self-energies for hard on-shell\nfermions are\n\u0002\n\u0003\u2217\n\u22121\n0\n0\n= \u2206A\n(9)\n\u2206R\n\u00b1 (p , p) ,\n\u00b1 (p , p) = 0\np \u2213 p + i\u0393p /2\n\u0002 A 0 \u0003\u2217\n0\n\u03a3R\n(10)\n\u00b1 (p , p) = \u2212i\u0393p /2 = \u03a3\u00b1 (p , p) ,\nwhen p0 \u2243 \u00b1p. The presence of the width regulates the pinching-pole divergence in the\none-loop expression, which now behaves as 1/\u0393p . However, the immediate consequence is\nthe need to sum all ladders diagrams with soft photon rungs, like the one depicted in Fig. 1.\nSince each new rung introduces a pair of propagators with pinching poles and the width scales\n(naively) as e2 , the powers of the coupling constant introduced by the rung are compensated\nfor by the factor 1/\u0393p from the nearly-pinching poles. As a result it is necessary to sum all\ncontributions from uncrossed ladders.3\n2\n\nThe gamma-matrices obey {\u03b3 \u03bc , \u03b3 \u03bd } = 2g \u03bc\u03bd with g \u03bc\u03bd = diag(1, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121).\nActually, the thermal width or corresponding inverse time scale \u223c e2 T never appears in the calculation\nof the conductivity. Instead the relevant scale is \u0393p \u223c e4 T ln(1/e). Therefore we think that a better way\nto justify the importance of ladder diagrams is as follows. For each additional soft photon rung, include a\nfactor e2 from the explicit interaction vertices, a factor m2D ln(1/e) from the integration over the rung, and a\nfactor \u03b4(\u03c9 \u00b1 p)/\u0393p \u223c [e4 T 2 ln(1/e)]\u22121 from the additional pinching poles, see Eq. (17). Putting this together\ngives that the contribution of each additional rung is \u223c 1 and all ladder diagrams are equally important.\n3\n\n5\n\n\fThese diagrams can be summed with a Bethe-Salpeter equation for an effective vertex\n\u0393 . In Ref. [12] such an equation was written and it was shown that the spatial part of\nthe integral equation, relevant for the transport coefficient, reduces to leading logarithmic\naccuracy to a differential equation equivalent to the one obtained previously in Ref. [4] using\nkinetic theory. As discussed in the Introduction, the equation for the vertex presented in\nRef. [12] does not satisfy the Ward identity and can therefore not be complete. In order for\nthe Ward identity to be fulfilled a new diagram has to be included such that the integral\nequation is the one depicted in Fig. 2.\nThe Euclidean correlator summing all the ladder diagrams is then given by4\nZ\nP\nii\n2\ntr \u03b3 i S(P + Q)\u0393i (P + Q, P )S(P ),\n(11)\n\u03a0E (Q) = e\n\u03bc\n\nP\n\nwith Q = (i\u03c9q , 0). We now follow Ref. [12] to express the electrical conductivity in terms\nof a particular analytic continuation of the effective vertex. After doing the sum over Matsubara frequencies, only products of retarded and advanced fermion propagators S R (p0 +\nq 0 , p)S A (p0 , p) must be retained because only these can have pinching poles. Furthermore, since q 0 goes to zero, it cannot change the mass shell condition of the electrons on\nthe side rails with hard momentum. Thus pinching poles arise only from the products\n0\n0\nA 0\n\u2206R\n\u00b1 (p + q , p)\u2206\u00b1 (p , p) and we find\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003h R\n0\ni i\n0\n2\nii 0\nnF (\u03c9 + q ) \u2212 nF (\u03c9) \u2206+ (\u03c9 + q 0 , p)\u2206A\n\u03a0R (q , 0) = 2ie\n+ (\u03c9, p)p\u0302 D+ (\u03c9 + q , \u03c9; p)\np,\u03c9\ni\n0\nA\ni i\n0\n\u2212\u2206R\n(\u03c9\n+\nq\n,\np)\u2206\n(\u03c9,\np)p\u0302\nD\n(\u03c9\n+\nq\n,\n\u03c9;\np)\n, (12)\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\nwhere nF (\u03c9) = 1/[exp(\u03c9/T ) + 1] is the Fermi distribution, and\nZ\nZ\nZ\nd3 p\nd\u03c9\n=\n.\n3\n(2\u03c0)\n2\u03c0\np,\u03c9\n\n(13)\n\nHere we used\nh\u00b1 (p\u0302)\u03b3 i h\u00b1 (p\u0302) = \u00b1p\u0302i h\u00b1 (p\u0302),\n\n(14)\n\n\u03bc\nD+\n(\u03c9 + q 0 , \u03c9; p) \u2261 \u016b\u03bb (p\u0302)\u0393\u03bc (\u03c9 + q 0 + i0+ , \u03c9 \u2212 i0+ ; p)u\u03bb (p\u0302),\n\u03bc\nD\u2212\n(\u03c9 + q 0 , \u03c9; p) \u2261 v\u0304\u03bb (p\u0302)\u0393\u03bc (\u03c9 + q 0 + i0+ , \u03c9 \u2212 i0+ ; p)v\u03bb (p\u0302).\n\n(15)\n(16)\n\nand defined\n\n4\n\nAs we will see below it is sufficient to have one full (\u0393i ) and one bare (\u03b3 i ) vertex since the real part of\nis subleading.\n\n\u0393iHTL\n\n6\n\n\fBoth helicities give the same result such that the sum over helicities yields a trivial factor 2\nin Eq. (12). Note that out of the many vertex functions with real energy arguments [13] only\none particular analytical continuation appears. Now, in the limit q 0 \u2192 0 and in the limit of\nnarrow width (weak coupling), the pair of propagators goes to its pinching-pole limit,\n0\nA\nlim\n\u2206R\n\u00b1 (\u03c9 + q , p)\u2206\u00b1 (\u03c9, p) =\n0\n\nq \u21920\n\n(\u03c9 \u2213\n\np)2\n\n1\n2\u03c0\n\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2213 p),\n\u2212\u2192\n2\n+ (\u0393p /2)\n\u0393p\n\n(17)\n\nforcing the on-shell condition \u03c9 = \u00b1p. Since in the pinching-pole limit the product of\npropagators (17) is real and only the imaginary part of \u03a0iiR (q 0 , 0) is needed for the electrical\nconductivity, only the real part of the effective vertex contributes. Therefore we define\ni\ni\nD\u00b1\n(p) \u2261 Re D\u00b1\n(\u00b1p + q 0 , \u00b1p; p)\n\nq 0 =0\n\n.\n\n(18)\n\ni\n(p) = p\u0302i D\u00b1 (p) and due to CP invariance\nFinally, since due to rotational invariance D\u00b1\nD+ (p) = \u2212D\u2212 (p) \u2261 D(p), the electrical conductivity is given by\nZ\n4e2\nD(p)\n\u03c3=\u2212\nn\u2032F (p)\n.\n(19)\n3 p\n\u0393p\n\nThis expression can be easily compared with the result from kinetic theory [4]. The factor 4\nreflects that both electrons and positrons with either helicity contribute in the same way.\n\n3\n\nThermal Width\n\nThe electrical conductivity depends on the thermal width \u0393p of a hard on-shell fermion,\nwhich screens the pinching-pole singularity and naturally sets an inverse time scale in the\nsystem. Kinetic theory calculations [2, 4] show that the relevant inverse relaxation time\nfor the electrical conductivity is 1/\u03c4 \u223c e4 T ln(T /mD ) \u223c e4 T ln(1/e), coming from large\nangle scattering between the hard nearly on-shell fermions in the plasma as well as from\nscattering processes that change the type of excitation. The thermal width, on the other\nhand, is dominated by scattering processes in which the fermions exchange a soft quasistatic\ntransverse gauge boson (the leading term is in fact logarithmically divergent, reflecting that\nin QED the thermal width is ill-defined) [1, 14]. This dominant contribution should therefore\nnot be relevant for the calculation of the electrical conductivity to leading logarithmic order.\nThis is indeed what is found in Refs. [1, 12] and will be confirmed in Section 5.5 The thermal\n5\n\nNote that in the case of the shear viscosity in a scalar theory or color conductivity in QCD the scattering\nprocesses that give the relevant relaxation time are those that also dominate the thermal width. In these\ncases the simple relation 1/\u03c4p \u223c \u0393p holds.\n\n7\n\n\fwidth, however, receives subleading contributions from scattering regimes different than the\nprevious one. A contribution of order e4 T ln(1/e) arises from the one-loop diagram with a soft\nfermion (see the second diagram in Fig. 3 below) and has been computed in Ref. [12]. This\ncontribution corresponds to Compton scattering and pair annihilation/creation processes,\nas can be seen by cutting the diagram, which are mediated by a soft fermion screened at\nthe scale of the Debye mass. As is shown in this section, there is also a contribution to the\nthermal width of order e4 T ln(1/e) from the one-loop diagram with a soft photon (see the\nfirst diagram in Fig. 3). This part arises from scatterings where the electrons exchange a\nsoft photon screened at the scale of the Debye mass.\nIn order to verify the Ward identity up to a given order in the coupling constant, all\nprocesses that contribute up to that order have to be included (in particular, not just those\nprocesses that contribute to transport). Therefore, we compute in this section the complete\ncontribution to the thermal width to order e4 T ln(1/e). In Sec. 5 we show how the scale\ne4 T ln(1/e) actually arises in the field theory calculation of the conductivity, from both\nsoft photon and soft fermion mediated scattering processes. It turns out that only the soft\nfermion contribution to the thermal width appears explicitly. The processes in which a soft\nphoton, screened at the scale of the Debye mass, is exchanged contribute not through the\nthermal width but in an indirect way, through the rungs in the ladder diagrams.\nThe thermal width of an on-shell electron is given by6\n0\n\u0393p = \u22122Im \u03a3R\n+ (p = p, p).\n\nThe one-loop fermion self-energy reads\nZ\n2P\n\u03a3(P ) = \u2212e\n\u03b3 \u03bd S(P + K)\u03b3 \u03bc D\u03bc\u03bd (K).\n\n(20)\n\n(21)\n\nK\n\nThe Matsubara sum is easily performed using spectral representations.

It is convenient to split the range of integration between \u039bmin and the Debye mass\nmD \u223c eT , and between mD and \u039bmax , such that the residues and dispersion relations can be\n(0)\napproximated in both ranges. For the leading-order term VT /L , the dominant contribution\ncomes from the lower part of the integral and from transverse photons only.

The next contribution, from VT /L , vanishes because it\nis odd in \u03c9. Therefore the next-to-leading order contribution to the thermal width comes\n(2)\nfrom VT /L . This contribution is finite and \u039bmin can be taken to zero. In this case sum rules\nshow that the dominant contribution arises from momentum mD \u226a k \u226a \u039bmax . We may\ntake \u039bmax \u223c T , since we are only interested in the coefficient of the logarithmic term [15].\nPerforming the integral over \u03c9 with the sum rules collected in Appendix A we arrive at\n\u0393(sp,nlo)\n=\np\n\ni\n\u03b1 m2D ln(1/e) h\np\n\u22121 + 2nF (p) +\n+ 2p n\u2032F (p) ,\n2p\n6T\n\n(38)\n\nwith m2D = e2 T 2 /3.

We also note that this contribution is negative for momentum p . 6T .\nHigher-order terms in the expansion in k/p of Eq. (31) yield contributions parametrically\nsuppressed with respect to e4 T ln(1/e).\nNow we turn to the contribution when the fermion is soft. Since in this case the momentum of the photon is hard, only the free transverse photon contributes.

A convenient way to proceed is to realize that the full vertex \u0393\u03bc is\nlinear in the \u03b3-matrices.7 Since the vertex then conserves helicity (see e.g. Eq. (49)) we may\nuse\n\u03bc\nh\u00b1 (r\u0302)\u0393\u03bc (\u00b1p + \u03c9 + i0+ , \u00b1p + \u03c9 \u2212 i0+ ; r)h\u00b1 (r\u0302) = h\u00b1 (r\u0302)D\u00b1\n(\u00b1p + \u03c9, \u00b1p + \u03c9; r).\n\nUsing then again Eq.

It is\nthen easy to see that our integral equation is consistent with the Ward identity (52). If we\nuse the Ward identity itself explicitly we can write\nA\n\u2206R\n+ (p + \u03c9, r)\u2206+ (p + \u03c9, r) D(r) = 2\u03c0i\u03b4(p + \u03c9 \u2212 r).\n\n(63)\n\nEq. (62) then indeed yields precisely i times the contribution to the thermal width from the\n(sp)\nsoft photon \u0393p in Eq. (29). We conclude that with both \u03930HTL and \u03930ladder the Ward identity\nis satisfied. We point out that the Ward identity relates the diagrams in the vertex equation\nto those contributing to the electron self-energy exactly, without doing any approximation.\n\n5\n\nIntegral equation for the spatial part of the vertex\n\nIn the previous section we verified that the modified vertex equation summing the ladders is\nconsistent with the Ward identity. Now we turn to the spatial part of the vertex equation,\nwhich appears in the expression for the transport coefficient.\nFirst we consider the contribution of the new diagram. It has an imaginary part which\nbehaves as \u223c 1/q 0 in the limit that q 0 \u2192 0, due to the structure of the HTL vertex. However,\nthe conductivity only depends on the real part of the vertex, so we focus on the real part\nonly. Since it is a modification of the tree level vertex (defined to be \u03b3 \u03bc ), in order to be\nrelevant for the calculation of the electrical conductivity, it should be at least of order 1. The\ninteraction vertices in the diagram give a factor e2 . One could expect that pinching poles\nmight be present and compensate for the explicit powers of the coupling constant; however\nit turns out that the frequency of the fermion propagators is always below the light-cone\nand therefore the poles of the HTL electron propagator, which lie above the light-cone, can\nnever be reached. The conclusion is therefore that in the limit q 0 \u2192 0 the real part of the\nnew diagram is finite and smaller than the tree level vertex. This is shown explicitly in\nAppendix B. In fact, explicit power counting shows that it is suppressed by three powers of\nthe coupling.\nIt only remains to compute the contribution from the diagram with the soft rung. This\nwas, in leading-logarithmic order, done in Ref. [12]. Here we derive the leading-log equation\nfor the effective vertex keeping the identification with the explicit expression of the self-energy\ncompletely general, which allows us to correct a small error in the derivation of Ref. [12].\nAfter doing the Matsubara frequency sum, the diagram reads\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\n0\ni\n0\n+\n+\n2\nnB (\u03c9) + nF (p + \u03c9 + q 0 ) \u2206R\n\u0393ladder (p + q + i0 , p \u2212 i0 ; p) = e\n+ (p + \u03c9 + q , r)\n\u00d7\u2206A\n+ (p\n\n\u03bc\n\ni\n\nk,\u03c9\n0\n\n+ \u03c9, r)\u03b3 h+ (r\u0302)\u0393 (p + \u03c9 + q + i0+ , p + \u03c9 \u2212 i0+ ; r)h+ (r\u0302)\u03b3 \u03bd \u2217\u03c1\u03bc\u03bd (\u03c9, k),\n15\n\n(64)\n\n\fwhere we recall that r = p + k. We choose to take p0 = p and since q 0 will be taken to\nzero, only positive-energy propagators contribute.

We studied the Ward identity for the effective\nphoton-electron vertex summing these diagrams. In order to match soft fermionic contributions to the thermal width of order e4 T ln(1/e), we found that a new diagram has be included\nin the integral equation for the vertex. This diagram contains a hard photon rung and soft\nfermion lines as well as the associated HTL vertex.\nA consequence of the Ward identity is that in the kinematical region relevant for transport\ncoefficients (external frequency q 0 \u2192 0 and external momentum q = 0), the imaginary part\nof the temporal component of the photon-electron vertex \u03930 (P + Q, P ) is singular \u223c \u0393p /q 0 ,\nwith \u0393p the thermal width for hard fermions. The real part is finite when q 0 \u2192 0 and\ntherefore subdominant. Similarly the imaginary part of the spatial vertex \u0393i (P + Q, P ) is\nsingular. However, in the expression for the electrical conductivity only the real part of the\neffective photon-electron vertex appears. We found that the real part of the new diagram is,\nin the kinematical regime of interest, suppressed by three powers of the coupling constant\nwith respect to the tree-level vertex. Therefore it does not contribute to the electrical\nconductivity at leading logarithmic order. For the same reason we expect it will also not\ncontribute at full leading order.\nThe thermal width receives contributions of order e4 T ln(1/e) from diagrams involving\neither a soft photon or a soft fermion. Only the contribution from soft fermions appears\nexplicitly in the expression for the conductivity to leading-log order. We have verified that the\ninverse relaxation time from the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation-time approximation\nfrom those contributions to the collision term where a fermion is exchanged, i.e. diagrams\nD (fermion annihilation) and E (Compton scattering) in Ref. [4], agrees precisely with the\n18\n\n\fresult (44). On the other hand, processes contributing to the thermal width which involve\nsoft photon exchange (i.e. Coulomb scattering) appear in the expression for the electrical\nconductivity only indirectly, through the rungs in the ladder diagrams.\nFor other transport coefficients, such as the shear viscosity, the soft fermionic contribution\nto the thermal width contributes as well. Therefore it seems that an additional diagram\nsimilar to \u0393\u03bcHTL in our vertex equation will be necessary; the analog of the HTL vertex in\nQED but with two fermion lines and one insertion of the operator \u03c0ij , the traceless spatial\npart of the energy momentum tensor. However, as is the case for the electrical conductivity,\nthis will probably not affect the leading-log differential equation for the effective vertex.\nFinally, to go beyond the leading-log approximation requires the inclusion of all contributions to the thermal width that are of order e4 T . The Ward identity may be a useful tool\nthat can help in verifying what type of diagrams contribute to the conductivity in this case.\nAcknowledgements\nWe gratefully acknowledge useful discussions with E.

We are interested in computing the\nreal part after contracting with the spinors \u016b\u03bb (p\u0302) . . . u\u03bb (p\u0302). First we must show that if we\nexpand in the external frequency q 0 , the real part of the first term 1/q 0 vanishes. For the\nlast group of terms we notice that since \u03c9\u00b1 (k) \u2265 k both the vertex and the propagators are\nreal (apart from the Dirac matrix structure).

Now, using the\nspectral density of the transverse photon Eq. (40), we see that the integral over \u03c9 is restricted\nto be below the light-cone. Therefore the propagators do not have poles and so there are no\npinching poles. After doing the algebra the first term in Eq.

However, the three combinations of propagators in the previous formula are real\nwhen q 0 \u2192 0, and since we need the real part of the new diagram, we also only need the real\npart of the HTL vertex. This is finite when the external frequency goes to zero, hence the\nreal part of the previous formula has the same property. Thus for the real part of Eq. (90)\nwe can safely put q 0 to zero. Finally, since there are no pinching poles, which could cancel\nsome of the powers of the coupling constant, we conclude that the whole expression is smaller\nthan the tree level vertex contribution. After writing \u03c9 = kx, expanding in powers of k/p\nand making the scaling k/mf = y, it can easily be seen that the contribution of Eq. (90)\nbehaves as e3 times a finite integral independent of the coupling constant. Therefore the real\npart of the new diagram is, in the pinching-pole limit, suppressed by e3 and it can safely be\nneglected.\n\nReferences\n[1] V. V. Lebedev and A. V.
