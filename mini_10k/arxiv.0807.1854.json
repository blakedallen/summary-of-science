The\nmechanism is quite general and can be implemented using a variety of methods. The examples of \u03ba-essence [2, 3]\nand varying speed of light (VSL) [4, 5, 6] were given, and\nother possibilities, such as non-adiabatic hydrodynamical matter, were considered. But in [1] we emphasized\nthe generality of the proposal and deliberately chose not\nto marry it to any specific model. This attitude was reversed in [7], where we initiated model-building appealing\nto bimetric VSL theories. Here we propose yet another\nconcrete VSL realization of scale-invariant fluctuations,\nthis time based on theories that rub shoulders with the\nphenomenology of quantum gravity.\nIn spite of the strong reactions they elicit [8, 9, 10] VSL\ntheories may be nothing more offensive than non-trivial\nrealizations of the Lorentz group. Two such approaches\nstand out: bimetric VSL and deformed special relativity\n(DSR). In the former the Lorentz group is realized by\ndifferent metrics for matter and for gravity, leading to\ndifferent speeds for photons (and other massless matter\nparticles) and gravitons [11]. In the latter the dispersion\nrelations are deformed from their usual quadratic form,\nso that the speed of all massless particles becomes energy dependent [13]. To prevent the introduction of a\npreferred frame one then chooses a suitable non-linear\nrepresentation of the Lorentz group [14, 15]. Other interpretations are possible-and of importance-but they\nwon't be relevant in this paper [16, 17, 18, 19].\nIt is not evident that DSR may be used to implement\nthe varying speed mechanism of [1], where the propagation speed cs is envisaged to vary with time, not with\nenergy. In bimetric theories [7] the speed of light varies\nin time and this is passed on to all matter propagation\nspeeds, including the speed of acoustic oscillations, cs .\nBut in DSR the speed of light is energy or wavelength\ndependent: not time-dependent. Yet DSR can indeed\nbe used to implement a time-varying cs \"by proxy\", in\nan expanding Universe. If we focus on a fixed comoving\nmode (as done in the usual perturbations' calculation)\n\nwe see its physical size stretch in time. Its \"energy scale\"\ntherefore changes in time, and so, under DSR, the mode\nis effectively subject to a time varying speed of light and\nconsequently of sound.\nThe cosmological redshift acts to convert a frequency\ndependent speed of light into a time-dependent speed of\nlight. This idea was already recognized in [20], in a different guise. If the speed of massless particles increases\nwith energy then the fact that the \"average particle\" has\na higher energy in the early Universe means that the\n\"ambient\" speed of light is also higher.\nII.\n\nVERY BASIC DSR\n\nWe start with a quick review of DSR, cast in a formalism that can be used here. It's possible that alternative formulations [18, 19] may be plugged into the fluctuations' calculation that follows, but this has not been\nchecked.\nLet us consider a deformed dispersion relation (DDR)\nof the form:\nE 2 f12 \u2212 k 2 f22 = m2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere f1 and f2 may be general functions of E and k.\nThen the group speed of light (or any other massless particles) c = dE\ndp becomes energy dependent. Expression (1)\nis not invariant under the linear Lorentz transformations.\nHowever it is possible to find a non-linear representation\nof the Lorentz group which leaves it invariant and prevents the introduction of a preferred frame, so that relativity between inertial observers is preserved. This is\ndone by considering the map:\nU \u25e6 (E, p) = (Ef1 , pf2 ),\n\n(2)\n\nand then changing the representation according to:\nK i = U \u22121 L0i U\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Lab = pa \u2202p\u2202 b \u2212 pb \u2202p\u2202a are the standard Lorentz\ngenerators. Exponentiation then gives us a set of nonlinear transformations for which (1) is invariant.\n\n\f2\nDSR has provided an excellent bridge between phenomenology and quantum gravity. The existence of an\ninvariant length or energy scale is the central connection,\nand this can easily be represented by the singular points\nof the transformation U . For this reason such theories\nare also called \"doubly special\" relativity (fortunately\nleading to the same acronym). However one may look\nat it more generally. For a recent review the reader can\nconsult [28].\nA number of issues arise at once. The theory is defined\nin momentum space, and once linearity is lost duals no\nlonger decouple and mimic each other. The introduction\nof an energy dependent space-time metric may then be\nnecessary, the so-called rainbow metric [21]. But other\nconstructions are possible [22, 23, 24, 25]. Also the field\ntheory realization of DSR remains an open issue [18, 19].\nHigher order derivative (HOD) theories will be advocated\nhere as a realization of DSR [26], not so much because we\nlove them, but because they permit a direct realization of\nthe varying speed of sound mechanism, which we stress\nis the central topic in this paper.\nHOD theories have been much maligned, not always\nfairly. They are usually blamed for hiding ghosts, but the\nargument is seldom understood, often not even known\nto those who wield it. Many pathologies used to smear\nHOD theories only occur if a theory with infinitely many\nderivatives is truncated [31, 32]. Also the threat of\npathologies doesn't even arise if the HOD behaviour is\nreserved to spatial derivatives: then all that happens is\nthat more data is required at spatial infinity for the problem to be well posed. This is definitely the case for the\nHOD theories considered in this paper.\nNote that various DSRs and HOD theories may be\nmade to correspond to a given DDR, particularly in the\nmassless limit. The expressions for f1 and f2 in (1) could\nbe changed (and they could be seen as different functions\nof E and k) leading to an algebraically equivalent DDR\nbut a different U map, and so a different DSR and HOD\nfield theory.\n\nIII.\n\nAN ADAPTATION OF THE DECAYING\nSPEED OF SOUND MECHANISM\n\nIt is straightforward to adapt the calculation in [1] to\nthe present, slightly different context (this was already\ndone, with a different motivation, by [29, 30]). Here we\npredict \"from first principles\", by means of DSR, deformed dispersion relations for the fluctuations. Thus,\ntheir speed of sound is wavelength dependent. But since\nthe wavelength of each mode increases due to cosmic expansion, its speed of sound is time dependent. This time\ndependence comes about by proxy-due to the indirect\neffect of expansion-but it has equivalent effects in terms\nof structure formation.\nLet us consider DDRs in the form (1) with f1 = 1 and\nf2 = g(\u03bbk), where k is a wavevector and \u03bb a parameter\nwith units of M \u22121 . We can then take the massless limit\n\nm = 0 and adapt to an expanding universe by introducing comoving \u03c9 and k, with g \u2192 g(\u03bbk/a). Thus:\n\u03c9 = kg(\u03bbk/a)\n\n(4)\n\nand if we consider an asymptotic regime where g behaves\nas the power-law g(x) \u221d x\u03b3 we find:\n\u0012 \u0013\u03b3\n\u03c9\n\u03bbk\nd\u03c9\n.\n(5)\n= (\u03b3 + 1) \u221d\nc=\ndk\nk\na\n1\n\nSince a \u221d \u03b7 \u01eb\u22121 with \u01eb = 32 (1 + w), where w = p/\u03c1 is\nthe equation of state, we can make contact with the law\nc \u221d \u03b7 \u2212\u03b1 used in [1], with\n\u03b1=\n\n\u03b3\n.\n\u01eb\u22121\n\n(6)\n\nBut note that c is now k dependent too, an important\ndifference with respect to [1].\nWhether we employ a hydrodynamical fluid or a scalar\nfield the density fluctuations are described by a modified\nharmonic oscillator equation. In terms of the curvature\nperturbation \u03b6 = \u2212v/z its equation takes the form [3,\n33, 34]:\n\u0015\n\u0014\nz \u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n2\nv=0\n(7)\nv + \u03c9 \u2212\nz\nbut now z \u221d a, as explained in [29] (cf. [1]). Here we\ncan write \u03c9 = ck for convenience, because for the models\nconsidered \u03c9/k and d\u03c9/dk (the phase and group speeds)\nare the same up to a factor of order one.\nFor modes to start oscillating and then freeze out (i.e.\nfor the horizon problem to be solved), we need the term in\n\u03c9 in Eq.(7) to dominate first. For an expanding Universe\nwith w > \u22121/3 (for which \u03b7 is positive and increases from\nzero) this requires \u03b1 > 1, that is:\n\u03b3 > \u03b30 = \u01eb \u2212 1 =\n\n1 + 3w\n.\n2\n\n(8)\n\nThis should be seen as the condition zero for our calculation to make sense.\nAs in [1] Eqn. (7) can be transformed into a Bessel\nequation, with a boundary condition obtained in the\nWKB limit. Under (8) modes start inside the horizon\n(set by ck\u03b7 \u223c 1), so that we can ignore the term in z \u2032\u2032 /z\nand find the the appropriately normalized WKB solution\nR\neik cd\u03b7\ne\u2212i\u03b2ck\u03b7\nv\u223c \u221a\n\u223c \u221a\n(9)\nck\nck\nwhere \u03b2 = 1/(\u03b1 \u2212 1) > 0. The full solution to Eqn. 7\nthen becomes\np\nv = \u03b2\u03b7(AJ\u03bd (\u03b2ck\u03b7) + BJ\u2212\u03bd (\u03b2ck\u03b7)) .\n(10)\n\nwhere A and B are k-independent numbers of order 1.\nThe order \u03bd is given by [36]\n\u03bd=\n\n3\u2212\u01eb\n2(\u03b3 \u2212 \u01eb + 1)\n\n(11)\n\n\f3\nif \u22121/3 < w < 1 (minus this expression if w > 1).\nThe spectrum left outside the horizon can now be\nfound. Since c\u03b7 is a decreasing function of time, the negative order solution is the growing mode, so that asymptotically we have:\n\u221a\n\u03b2\u03b7\n.\n(12)\nv\u223c\n(ck\u03b7)\u03bd\nA further adaptation of [1] is required because c in this\nexpression is k dependent. Since \u03b6 = \u2212v/z, and the\nspectral index is defined from k 3 \u03b6 2 = A2 k nS \u22121 , we have:\nnS \u2212 1 =\n\n\u01eb(\u03b3 \u2212 2)\n.\n\u03b3\u2212\u01eb+1\n\n(13)\n\nScale-invariance therefore requires \u03b3 = 2 for all equations\nof state which satisfy \u22121/3 < w < 1 [37]. This also\ncomplies with (8) for all w in this range. We can make\nthe spectrum as red as we want (with \u03b30 < \u03b3 < 2), but\nthe bluest it gets is nS = 1 + \u01eb, for \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e.\nAs in [1] the amplitude of the fluctuations may be\nfound by refining the DDRs to g = 1 + (\u03bbk)2 , enforcing\nthe correct low energy limit. The scale \u03bb is then responsible for the amplitude A in k 3 \u03b6 2 = A2 k nS \u22121 . Straightforward algebra leads to A \u223c 1/(\u03bbMP l ), implying that\n\u03bb \u223c 105 LP l .\nIt is somewhat surprising that scale-invariance is associated with a universal law, with details such as the\nbackground equation of state w falling out of the result\n(see [1, 7] for similar miracles). However here this is only\ntrue if the sub-horizon normalization is chosen to match\na vacuum quantum state. Should it be a thermal state,\nas discussed in [1], we have for the spectral index:\nnS \u2212 1 =\n\n(\u01eb \u2212 1)(\u03b3 \u2212 1) \u2212 2\n\u03b3\u2212\u01eb+1\n\n(14)\n\nso that scale-invariance now requires\n5 + 3w\n\u01eb+1\n=\n\u03b3=\n\u01eb\u22121\n1 + 3w\n\nIts associated HOD field theory satisfies the KleinGordon equation:\n[\u220202 \u2212 \u2202i2 (1 + (\u03bb\u2202i )4 ) + m2 ]\u03c6 = 0\n\n(15)\n\n\u03c9 2 \u2212 k 2 (1 + (\u03bbk)2 )2 = m2\n\nU \u25e6 (E, p) = (E, p(1 + (\u03bbp)2 ))\n\n(16)\n\nwith \u03bb \u223c 105 LP l . This is not a truncation: quite the\nopposite. We're probing the \u03bbk \u226b 1 regime, so the term\n\n(19)\n\n(see [21, 35] for possible couplings of DSR and gravity).\nThe conditions of our calculation (that the deformation\nis purely spatial) are then satisfied. It is possible that\nother frameworks for DSR and its coupling to gravity\nsatisfy this condition.\nEven within this framework other U are possible. For\nexample with\n\nTHE ASSOCIATED DSR\n\nWhat can we learn about DSR from this calculation?\nForemost we have constrained the dispersion relations of\nthe fluctuations. Specifically, if vacuum quantum fluctuations are responsible for the structure of the Universe,\nthen for all w the DDRs should be of the form:\n\n(18)\n\nA coupling to gravity could be chosen such that this became:\n[\u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bc + \u03bb4 (D\u03bc D\u03bc )2 + m2 ]\u03c6 = 0\n\nand the condition for scale-invariance becomes w dependent. In the range under study (\u22121/3 < w < 1) it requires \u03b3 > 2, for example for a radiation background it\nrequires \u03b3 = 3.\nIV.\n\nin (\u03bbk)4 should be the highest power in the dispersion\nrelation. Different lower powers are admissible, for example the DDRs could equally be \u03c9 2 \u2212 k 2 (1 + \u03bbk)4 = m2 .\nThe speed of light profile could be c = 1 + (\u03bbk)2 or\nc = (1 + \u03bbk)2 with the same effects for structure formation; but terms in (\u03bbk)4 or (\u03bbk)6 in c(k) are excluded.\nHowever if thermal (as opposed to quantum vacuum)\nfluctuations are behind the structure of the Universe\nmore general DDRs become possible.\nThese DDRs may be be incorporated into a variety\nof DSRs or other similar such constructions and the assumptions of the calculation are not totally insensitive to\nthe specific realization. Since structure formation only\nprobes the massless limit, only the ratio of f1 and f2 is\nconstrained. f1 and f2 can then be seen as functions of k,\nE or both. These algebraic rearrangements do not affect\nthe DDRs themselves, but do affect the DSR that contains them [15]. They're also reflected in the associated\nfield theory [26, 32].\nCrucially in our calculation, the field theory should be\nsuch that the deformations only affect spatial gradients,\ni.e. derivatives D\u03bc = (g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 n\u03bc n\u03bd )\u2207\u03bd where to zeroth\norder n\u03bc points along the cosmological time. Then the\nbackground evolution in a perturbed expanding Universe\nisn't affected by the deformation; also z \u221d a in the perturbation calculations (see [29] for details).\nFor example we could take a DSR generated by\np\nU \u25e6 (E, p) = (E, p (1 + (\u03bbp)4 ) .\n(17)\n\n(20)\n\none gets the non-linear representation of Lorentz transformations:\np\u2032x (1\np\u2032y (1\np\u2032z (1\n\nE \u2032 = \u03b3[E \u2212 vpx (1 + (\u03bbp)2 )]\n+ (\u03bbp ) ) = \u03b3[px (1 + (\u03bbp)2 ) \u2212 vE]\n+ (\u03bbp\u2032 )2 ) = py (1 + (\u03bbp)2 )\n\u2032 2\n\n+ (\u03bbp\u2032 )2 ) = pz (1 + (\u03bbp)2 ) .\n\n(21)\n\nIf we restrict ourselves to transformations along the direction of motion, in the limit \u03bbp \u226b 1 these may be\n\n\f4\nwritten out explicitly as:\nE \u2032 = \u03b3(E \u2212 vp(\u03bbp)2 )\n\np\u2032 = [\u03b3(p3 \u2212 vE\u03bb\u22122 )]1/3\n\n(22)\n\nAlthough the DDRs are the correct ones the ensuing\nHOD field theory doesn't comply with the assumptions\nof the calculation. It is possible, however, that a modified calculation could be carried out and lead to scaleinvariance even for these theories.\n\nThe HOD field theory associated with it has KleinGordon equation:\nV.\n\n[\u220202 \u2212 \u2202i2 (1 + (\u03bb\u2202i )2 )2 + m2 ]\u03c6 = 0\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n(23)\n\n(30)\n\nIf the speed of light, seen as a function of the wavelength, has a pole of degree 2 at the origin, then the\nsimplest adaptation of the varying speed of sound mechanism for structure formation leads to scale-invariant fluctuations. Additional minimal technical assumptions on\nDSR and its coupling to gravity have to be made (realized for example using [21, 26]). Other interpretations\nof DSR may or may not comply with the assumptions\nof the calculation, and we encourage their proponents to\ncarry out this work. Here, for definiteness, we embedded the required DDRs into non-linear representations\nof the Lorentz group [15], HOD field theories [26] and\nthe rainbow metric [21], but it may well be that this is\nnot strictly necessary.\nWhat practical advantages could this mechanism have\nover inflation? Foremost there's no need for reheating.\nThe DSR behaviour studied in this paper concerns regular matter, with the high energies experienced by the\nearly Universe triggering VSL behavior. As the universe\nexpands and cools this unusual behavior disappears, leaving the Universed filled with standard radiation engaged\nin \"business as usual\", without the need for a \"decay\"\nor reheating. In other words there's no esoteric matter\nhere, merely regular matter behaving in an esoteric way.\nBeyond this obvious practical advantage, we believe\nthat the main novelty of the scenario proposed here is\nthat it connects better with theories of phenomenology\nof quantum gravity, such as the DSR arena.\nI'd like to thank C.
