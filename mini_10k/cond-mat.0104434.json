A GaAs/AlAs reference sample consisting of\ntwo layers of AlAs (1 ML and 36 ML) separated by 44 ML of a GaAs matrix was depth\nprofiled using almost identical sputtering conditions: Ar+ ions of 3 keV impact energy\nand 52 (SIMS: CAMECA 4f) and 58 deg. (AES: VG Microlab 310F) incidence angle.\nBoth the Al+ intensity of the SIMS profile and the Al (LVV) intensity of the AES profile\nwere quantified by fitting the measured profiles with those calculated with the MRI\nmodel, resulting in the same mixing length of 3.0 \u00b1 0.3 nm, similar roughness parameter\n(1.4-2 nm), and negligible information depth (0.4 nm). Whereas practically no matrix\neffect was observed for AES as well as for Al+ in the SIMS profile, quantification using\ndimer (Al2+) and trimer (Al3+) ions shows a marked nonlinearity between concentration\nand intensity, with the main effect caused by simple mass action law probability of\ncluster ion formation.\nKey words: Depth Profiling, delta layer, deconvolution, quantitative AES and SIMS .\nIntroduction\nDepth profiling with ultra high resolution is a fast developing field of practical surface\nanalysis1-3. Although the physical limits are almost attained, mainly by reducing the ion\nbeam induced atomic mixing, for example by using low energy primary ions4 or\nmolecular cluster ions2,5, the measured depth profile data still need some kind of\ndeconvolution procedure to reconstruct the original in depth distribution of composition.\nWhereas noise in the data restricts precision, nonlinear relationships between signal\nintensity and/or sputtering time and elemental concentration and/or sputtered depth,\nrespectively, impede usual deconvolution procedures and limit the accuracy of profile\nreconstruction1. The MRI (Mixing-Roughness-Information depth)-model6,7 has been\nshown to be applicable for the reconstruction of the in- depth compositional distribution\na)\n\nelectronic mail: hofmann@mf.mpi-stuttgart.mpg.de\n\n1\n\n\ffrom both AES and SIMS depth profiles. A stringent test of the validity of the MRI\nmodel requires the same result when using SIMS or AES on the same sample under\nidentical sputtering conditions, where sputtering induced atomic mixing and surface\nroughness are expected to be the same. However, there is a basic difference in the\nanalysis signal: (i) In contrast to SIMS, the elemental analysis signal in AES is\nindependent of the primary ion flux, and is only little influenced by matrix effects.\nTherefore it is practically proportional to the elemental surface concentration. In SIMS, a\nnon-linear dependence of the secondary ion current on surface composition is frequently\nobserved8, because the latter influences both sputter yield and ionisation probability; (ii)\nthe information depth in AES depends on the Auger electron escape depth, i.e. their\nkinetic energy and emission angle, whereas in SIMS the information depth is dertemined\nby the escape depth of the secondary ions emitted from the first 1-2 atomic monolayers8;\n(iii) the dynamic range of the signal intensity is limited to about 2 - 3 orders of magnitude\nin AES, whereas the high dynamic range of SIMS typically covers about 6 orders of\nmagnitude. Taking the above arguments into account, it is clear that SIMS is\nadvantageous for profiling low concentration distributions such as dopant and delta\nlayers, while AES is advantageous for interface and multilayer profiling.\nIn this paper, depth profile measurements by SIMS and AES are reported for a reference\nsample covering both regimes (delta layer and interface), where nonlinearities should be\nrevealed. Quantitative profile reconstruction using the MRI model show direct similarity\nof the SIMS (Al+) and AES (Al LVV) results and negligible nonlinearity. This is in\naccordance with earlier work9 using dimer secondary ions (Al2+, Ga2+), where nonlinear\nbehavior is expected10. There, a simple power law was shown to be sufficient for\nlinearization. In this work, in addition trimer secondary ions (Al3+) intensity is shown to\nfollow a similar power law, too.\n\nExperimental\nThe sample has the following GaAs/AlAs multilayer structure, (in ML, with 1 ML=0.28\nnm) which was confirmed by high resolution TEM images:\n40GaAs/1AlAs/44GaAs/36AlAs/GaAs(bulk)\nDepth profiles were obtained with SIMS (CAMECA 4f) and AES (Microlab 310F)\ninstruments under practically the same sputtering conditions. Ar+ primary ions with 3\nkeV impact energy and an incidence angle of 52 deg (SIMS) and of 58 deg (AES) from\nthe surface normal. The AES experiments were carried out with sample rotation.\nIn three different SIMS experiments, the following secondary ions were measured as a\nfunction of the sputtering time: Al+, Ga+, Al++, O+, AlO+, Al2+, Al3+, As+, GaO+, and\nGa2+. In this paper we will focus on Al+ data, and compare Al2+ and Al3+ profiles and\ntheir quantitative evaluation with the MRI model.\nIn AES profiling, the Al LVV (68 eV) and Ga LMM (1063 eV) signals were recorded as\na function of the sputtering time. The emission angle for Auger electrons was 40 deg\nfrom the surface normal, which gives the MRI - information depth parameter (taken here\nas mean electron escape depth) 1.58 nm for Ga LMM and 0.4 nm for Al LVV based on\n\n2\n\n\fthe attenuation length values from refs. [11,12]. Fortuitously, the latter value coincides\nwith the one generally assumed for SIMS data (between 1 and 2 ML). Only the Al LVV\nprofiles are considered here, the Ga LMM results were reported elsewhere9.\n\nResults and Discussion\nThe experimental results were fitted with the MRI model results, as previously described\n(see for example refs.[6,7,13]). The model uses 3 physically well defined parameters:\nmixing zone length (w), roughness parameter (\u03c3) and information depth (\u03bb), which may\nbe extracted from the measured depth profile or found independently14, and calculates\ntheir influence on the shape of the sputter profile of an assumed layer structure. By\ncomparison of the measured profile with the profile calculation, the optimum fit results in\na quantitative reconstruction of the elemental in depth distribution of composition.\nReference samples of the type used here serve to find the MRI parameters for the depth\nresolution functions that can be applied for quantification of unknown profiles15.\nSputtering Time (s)\n0\n\n200\n\n300\n1.0\n\n8\n\nMRI calc:\n\nSIMS exp.\n+\n\n+\n\nAl Intensity (c/s)\n\n2x10\n\n8\n\n1x10\n\n8\n\nw = 3.0 nm\n\u03c3 = 1.4 nm\n\u03bb = 0.4 nm\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.8\n\n(3 keV Ar )\n\nCalc.

The fit gives the length of the mixing zone, w = 3.0\nnm, and the roughness, \u03c3 = 1.4 nm, together with the information depth for SIMS taken\nas \u03bb = 0.4 nm (see above). The latter value is much lower than the other parameters, and\nits uncertainty has almost no influence on the experimental results. The value of the\nmixing length (w = 3.0 nm) compares reasonably well with the mean projected range of 3\n\n3\n\n\fkeV Ar+ ions obtained from TRIM calculations ( GaAs: 2.3 \u00b1 1.3 nm; AlAs: 2.5 \u00b1 1.4\nnm)16. Note that a reasonable fit was obtained by assuming a linear relationship for the\ndelta layer (1 ML AlAs) and for the \"thick\" layer (36 ML AlAs) with the same\nparameters, i.e. over more than 3 orders of magnitude of concentration, as seen in the\nlogarithmic plot in Fig.2a.\n\nSputtering Time (s)\n50\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n1.0\n\nMRI calc.:\n\n3 keV Ar\n\n40\n\n+\n\n0.8\n\nw = 3.0 nm\n\u03c3 = 2.0 nm\n\u03bb = 0.4 nm\n\n0.6\n\n30\n0.4\n\n20\n\n0.2\n\nNorm.

MRI- parameters are given in the\ninset.\n\nAES depth profiling was carried out under practically the same experimental conditions\nin order to test the validity of data evaluation with the MRI model. The result is shown in\nFig. 1(b). The mixing length, w = 3.0 nm, is indeed the same for SIMS and AES, within\nthe error limit ( \u00b1 0.2 nm ). This is expected because of the nearly identical sputtering\nconditions. The difference in the roughness parameter (\u03c3 = 2.0 nm for AES, 1.4 nm for\nSIMS) may be attributed to the slight difference in the ion incidence angle (AES:58 deg.,\nSIMS: 52 deg.) different ion gun adjustments and to the use of sample rotation with only\none analytical technique (AES).\nComparison of the logarithmic scale data of the AES profile in Fig. 2 (b) with Fig 2 (a)\nclearly demonstrates the disadvantage of AES at lower concentrations as compared to\nSIMS. The scatter of the AES data gets too large below 1% of the maximum signal of\nabout 92% of the bulk intensity (see below).\n\n4\n\n\fQuantification:\nAssuming a linear relationship between elemental signal intensity and concentration, the\nmaximum intensity for a sufficiently thick layer of the respective element corresponds to\n100 at% (or mole fraction = 1, with the corresponding intensity I0).\nSputtering Time (s)\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n1\n\n10\n\nSIMS exp.\n\n8\n\nMRI calc:\n\n+\n\nw = 3.0 nm\n\n10\n\n0.1\n\n\u03c3 = 1.4 nm\n\u03bb = 0.4 nm\n\n7\n\n0.01\n\n+\n\nAl Intensity (c/s)\n\n+\n\nAl\n\n10\n\nCalc.

On the right hand side in Figs. 1a,b, and 2a,b, the scale is\nin fractions of the Al concentration in AlAs, which means that the peak signal of 36 ML\nof AlAs corresponds to 0.92 parts of Al in AlAs or to 46 at % Al. The maximum of the\ndelta layer profile corresponds to about 0.05 parts or 2.5 at% of Al, respectively, if the\noriginal layer consists of exactly 1.0 ML of AlAs.\nIn the logarithmic SIMS data of Fig.2a, the solid line shows the MRI calculation with the\ngiven layer input as revealed from the TEM cross section image, i.e. 1 ML AlAs, 44 ML\nGaAs and 36 ML AlAs. The small deviation of less than 10% between the calculation\nand the measured points means that the upper limit of nonlinearity is 10%, a fairly good\nvalue for SIMS, which is confirmed by the completely independent AES measurements\nplotted on a logarithmic scale in Fig. 2b. Assuming constancy of the depth resolution\nfunction and that the only remaining nonlinearity is that of the relation between\nsputtering time and depth, i.e. a slightly different sputtering rate for GaAs and AlAs (<\n5% as shown in ref. [6]), this could be implemented in the modified MRI model15,18.\nBecause of the smallness of the effect, the sputtering rate differences can be neglected\nhere. The maximum of the delta layer profile is calculated somewhat too high. Therefore,\nit is concluded that the layer is slightly thinner than 1 ML. With an Al content\ncorresponding to 0.9 ML AlAs, the optimum fit is shown as solid line in Fig.3a. In\naddition, Fig. 3a shows the original (reconstructed) depth distribution (in ML:\n40GaAs/0.9AlAs/44GaAs/36AlAs/GaAs...) together with the MRI quantification. To get\nan idea of the achieved accuracy, the calculated profiles for 0.7 ML and 1.1 ML AlAs are\nshown in Fig. 3b. It may be concluded that the error is less than \u00b1 0.2 ML (\u00b10.06 nm).\nCluster ion emission:\nCluster ion formation depends on many parameters and its quantitative description is\ndifficult even for pure elements10,19. In a first order approximation, according to the mass\naction law, the reaction of cluster formation is expected to be proportional to the\nquadrature or to the 3rd power of the atomic concentration for dimers or trimers,\nrespectively and we may expect for the measured intensities I(Al n+) of those species:\nI(Al+) = k1* X(Al)\n\n(1)\n\nI(Al2+) = k2*(X(Al))2\n\n(2)\n\nI(Al3+) = k3*(X(Al))3,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere X(Al) is the mole fraction of Al and k1,k2,k3 are factors which include the relative\nsensitivity factor for the respective ion species, matrix effects and experimental\nconditions. Assuming that these factors are constant, and because the information depth\n(i.e. mean escape depth of secondary ions) is small against the mixing length under the\npresent conditions (3 keV Ar+ ions), the normalized intensity I/I0, calculated with the\nMRI model, should be proportional to the instantaneous concentration, X(Al).

Therefore the MRI model result can be directly\ncompared with I(Al+) after eqn. (1), and with I(Al2+)1/2 and I(Al3+)1/3 after eqns. (2) and\n(3), if the assumptions and simplifications made above are valid. Of course similar\nrelations are expected for Ga clusters, as discussed in ref.[9] for Ga2+ dimer ions.\nFigs. 1a,b and 2a,b demonstrate the linear behavior expected after eqn.(1). Eqn. (2)\npredicts a nonlinear relation between I(Al2+) and X(Al). Indeed, this is seen in the direct\ncomparison of the Al+ intensity (from Fig. 2a) with the Al2+ intensity normalized to the\nmaximum value of each profile, as shown in Fig. 4a. According to eqns. (1) and (2), the\nsquare root of I(Al2+), also shown in Fig.4a, should be equal to I(Al+). Indeed, the square\nroot is more close to I(Al+), but the deviation is still significant and shows that the correct\nexponent should lie between 0.5 and 1. It is found to be 0.62 for the dimers, as already\nshown in ref. [1] by comparison with AES results. For I(Al3+), the exponent after eqn.\n(3), 0.33, is likewise too small. Fig. 4b shows, that the dimer data, even from two\nindependent experiments, and the trimer data can be linearized and consistently\nreproduced by the MRI model for the intesity exponent 0.62 for the dimer and 0.4 for the\ntrimer. Note that there is more than an order of magnitude difference between the\nmaximum count rates of I(Al+), I(Al2+) and I(Al3+). For the latter, the delta layer signal\nvanishes in the noise.\nConclusions\nThe direct comparison of SIMS and AES profiles obtained on the same samples of a\nbilayer structure of AlAs in GaAs with practically the same sputtering conditions provide\na test for the applicability of the MRI model for profile quantification. Both the SIMS and\nAES data sets for Al can be fitted using the same parameter for the mixing length. While\nthe information depth for Al is accidentally the same, the roughness is slightly different.\nHowever, this parameter is difficult to control, because it depends sensitively on the setup\nof the experiments, (e.g. sample rotation was only used in the AES profiling experiment).\nEven for the large concentration differences in the mixing zone between the delta layer\nprofile and a thick layer profile, the intensity of Al + scales linearly with that calculated by\nthe MRI model. In addition, depth profiles of the intensities of the secondary cluster ions\nAl 2+ and Al3+ can also be fitted with the model by an empirical power law, I(Al2+)0.62 and\nI(Al3+)0.4, a small but significant modification of the exponents 0.5 and 0.33, respectively,\nexpected under simplified conditions.\nReferences:\n[1] P.
