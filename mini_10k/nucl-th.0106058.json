Our approach\nis based on a quantum hadrodynamics model with exchange of \u03c3, \u03c9, \u03c0, \u03c1 and \u03b4 mesons. In view\nof applications to neutrino transport in the final stages of supernova explosion and protoneutron\nstar cooling, we study the evolution of the neutrino mean free path as a function of density,\nproton-neutron asymmetry and temperature. Special attention was paid to the issues of renormalization of the Dirac sea, residual interactions in the tensor channel and meson mixing. It\nis found that RPA corrections, with respect to the mean field approximation, amount to only\n10% to 15% at high density.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nNeutrino transport is a key ingredient to understand the mechanism of supernova explosion and\nthe subsequent cooling of the proto neutron star formed in the collapse. In the delayed explosion\nmechanism suggested by Wilson, the problem of shock stall can be overcome if sufficient energy\nis deposited by the neutrinos to revive the shock. It is seen in recent numerical simulations [1, 2,\n3, 4, 5, 6] of core collapse that, besides other issues such as convection, the final outcome of the\nexplosion depends sensitively on the rate of neutrino energy deposition.\nThe following stage of protoneutron star cooling also depends on the rate of neutrino transport. It determines the shape of the neutrino signal emitted during the first few seconds of the\nprotoneutron star formation. It has also been suggested that the deleptonization could trigger an\ninstability as the star cools down, and lead to the delayed formation of a black hole, in order to\nexplain the time interval observed between the 8th and 9th neutrino detected in the explosion of the\nSN1987a supernova. It is thus important to refine the models, since we now begin to benefit of the\nobservation of young neutron star surface temperatures, and of the upgrading of neutrino detectors\nsuch as SuperKamiokande, MACRO, SNO or AMANDA (see e.g. [7]) to collect observational data\nfrom an eventual supernova explosion.\nAn enhanced neutrino emission can occur at high densities if the neutrino-nucleon cross section\nis modified through the nuclear correlations, as was recognized in the early works of Iwamoto and\nPethick [8] and Sawyer [9]. Interest in this topic has recently been revived by the feasability of full\nBoltzmann simulations of neutrino transport in collapsing supernovae [2, 3, 4, 5].\nWhile early calculations only were taking into account the nucleon mass reduction in the\nmedium, important progress has been realized since then in order to include Hartree-Fock [10],\n1\n\n\frandom phase approximation (RPA) [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] or ladder [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]\ncorrelations. It is generally found that the neutrino opacities are suppressed by medium effects,\nif however no collective mode is excited [16]. As a matter of fact, the latter authors find a sizeable enhancement due to the excitation of a spin zero sound mode, announcing a transition to a\nferromagnetic state in a nonrelativistic treatment. Due to the degree of uncertainty existing on\nthe equation of state of neutron star matter at high density, the existence of such a transition\nremains an open question, although it seems unfavoured in a relativistic treatment. Even if no\nsuch instability exists, it is important to check the order of magnitude of the suppression factor to\nbe applied to the scattering rate.\nIn order to asses the importance of some points raised in previous calculations, we present in\nthis paper a new calculation of the neutrino-nucleon rate in dense, hot, asymmetric matter. After\na short presentation of the relativistic meson exchange model and relevant formulae in section\ntwo, we first perform a few calculations in a simplified model where the background matter is\napproximated by pure neutron matter. In particular, we examine the effect of the Dirac sea and\nof various renormalization procedures commonly used in the litterature in order to subtract the\ndivergences in the vacuum fluctuation term. As a matter of fact, calculations reported in [25]\nadscribed a sizeable correction due to this effect. In contrast, we found here only a minor effect on\nthe size and position of the zero sound mode in the longitudinal component, which moreover gets\nwashed out by Landau damping and integration on the exchanged momentum and energy. These\nresults are presented in section three.\nWe also studied the way of introducing the short-ranged residual interaction in the tensor\nchannel, which has to be taken into account in order to avoid the appearance of unobserved pion\ncondensation at low density. In the non relativistic formalism, this is commonly done by adding a\nLandau-Migdal contact interaction. In the relativistic case, this has been done by various methods,\none beeing Horowitz's Ansatz in the pion propagator [12, 26]. Two previous works [13, 17] using\nthis Ansatz found their results to be very sensitive to the choice of the numerical value of the\nLandau-Migdal constant g\u2032 . We compare results obtained with this Ansatz to those obtained from\na more transparent and straightforward way of introducing this term through a contact Lagrangian.\nWe conclude that there is no dependence on the value of g \u2032 , once the contact term is properly taken\ninto account, and point out a possible explanation for the discrepancy with the authors previously\nquoted. These results are presented in section four.\nIn a second part of this paper, corresponding to section four, we study the full model where\nthe background matter is asymmetric. The proton fraction may be given as a fixed value, or be\ndetermined by \u03b2 equilibrium in the two extreme situations of neutrino free matter Y\u03bd = 0, or\ntrapped neutrinos with a lepton fraction typical of supernovae YL \u2243 0.4. Here we point out the\nfact that the phenomenon of meson mixing has not been taken fully into account in the previous\ntreatments. Indeed, in addition to the usual \u03c3-\u03c9 mixing, the neutron-proton asymmetry also opens\nthe possibility of \u03c3-\u03c1 and \u03c9-\u03c1 mixing in the case of neutral current relevant for neutrino-nucleon\nscattering. Finally, we consider here the contribution of the \u03b4 meson. This meson is usually left\nout, since the \u03c3, \u03c9 and \u03c1 mesons are sufficient to describe the properties of nuclear matter at the\nmean field level. In asymmetric matter however, it can have a non negligible contribution and it\nmixes with the \u03c3, \u03c9 and \u03c1 mesons.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n2.1\n\nNeutrino-nucleon scattering in the relativistic random phase\napproximation\nFree scattering rate\n\nTwo related processes are needed in order to calculate the mean free path and spectrum of neutrinos\nin matter.

It\nwill be taken into account in the final stage of the calculation when we compute the mean free path\nof the neutrino in matter. In this formula, the tensor L\u03bc\u03bd represents the lepton current, coupled\nwith the weak vertex \u0393\u03b1W e = \u03b3 \u03b1 (1 \u2212 \u03b35 ).

At the mean field level, the nucleon behaves as a quasiparticle\nwith effective mass M , momentum P and chemical potential \u03bc, and the propagator can written as\nthe sum of a vacuum and a density dependent term (see e.g. [27, 28])\n\u001a\n\n1\n+ 2i\u03c0\u03b4(P 2 \u2212 M 2 ) [\u03b8(p0 )n(p0 ) + \u03b8(\u2212p0 )n(p0 )]\nG (p) = (\u03b3.P + M )\n2\nP \u2212 M 2 + i\u01eb\n1\n1\nwith\nn(p0 ) = \u03b2(p \u2212\u03bc)\n, n(p0 ) = \u2212\u03b2(p \u2212\u03bc)\n0\n0\ne\n+1\ne\n+1\n11\n\n2.2\n\n\u001b\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\nRPA corrections\n\nIn the hot and dense medium through which the neutrino is moving in the protoneutron star, the\nnucleon is not free, but correlated with the other nucleons through the strong interaction. Several\neffects contribute, among which are:\n\u2013 The fact that the nucleons can be described in the medium as quasiparticles with effective masses\nand chemical potentials. This represents the mean field approximation. This correction has already\nbeen taken into account in the preceding section in the definition of the nucleon propagator.\n\u2013 One can go a step further and include the exchange term at the level of Hartree-Fock correlations.\nThis is the approach of e.g. Fabbri and Matera [10]. We will not consider this type of corrections\nhere.\n\u2013 Another consequence of the correlations is the broadening of the nucleon width, corresponding\nto the inclusion of ladder corrections [18, 19, 20, 22]. This is the equivalent for scattering to the\nLandau-Migdal-Pomeranchuk effect studied in the case of neutrino Bremsstrahlung by [23, 24, 29].\n\u2013 Finally, one has to take into account the RPA correlations. This is the subject of the present\nwork.\nThe strong interaction may be modelized by relativistic \u03c3, \u03c9, \u03c0 and \u03c1 meson exchange. We will\nalso include the \u03b4 meson in a later stage of this calculation (see section \u00a74.1) in order to investigate\nsome specific effects related to the fact that the matter of the proto neutron star has a sizeable\nproton-neutron asymmetry.

It will be seen anyway, at the end of the calculation,\nthat in fact the pion does not contribute directly to the neutral current process. The non-linear\n\u03c3 couplings \u03c3 3 , \u03c3 4 are introduced in order to obtain a better description of the equation of state\nwith a value of the incompressibility modulus and effective mass at saturation density in agreement\nwith the experimental data.\nRPA correlations can be introduced by substituting the mean field polarization in Eq.

The first term of the Dyson equation corresponds\nto the mean field approximation taken in the preceding section.\nThe Dyson equation can be rewritten as\ne \u03bc\u03bd = \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd +\n\u03a0\nWW\nWW\n\nX\n\n(a) \u03bc\u03b1\n\na,b=\u03c3,\u03c9,\u03c1,\u03c0...\n\n(ab)\n\n(b) \u03b2\u03bd\n\ne\n\u03a0W S D\nSS \u03b1\u03b2 \u03a0SW\n\n(13)\n\ne SS dressed in the RPA approximation.\nwhich provides a solution in terms of the meson propagator D\n\n2.3\n\nPolarizations\n\nPolarization insertions were calculated in the relativistic random phase approximation.

(9). The\n\u0393A are the vertices of the interaction, which can be either of the weak type \u0393W = CV \u03b3 \u03bc + CA \u03b35 \u03b3 \u03bc\nor of the strong type \u0393S with S = {\u03c3, \u03c9, \u03c1, \u03c0, \u03b4}. Formulae are given for the polarizations in e.g.\n[12, 30, 31, 32, 33].\nThe polarizations can also be obtained by performing a linear response analysis on a Hartree\nground state. This was the method used in the following references, to which the reader is referred\nfor a full account of the calculation techniques and meson dispersion relations. The method was\ndescribed in [34]\u2013[40], with results given for the \u03c0 meson in [34], for the \u03c3, and \u03c9 mesons in [35, 36]\nand for the \u03c1 in [37, 38]. The notation we are using here can be found in [39], which also presents\na discussion of some results concerning the introduction of the contact term. Results concerning\nasymmetric matter are presented in [40]. A new feature, which has been overlooked in previous\ndeterminations of the RPA corrections [13, 17, 15], is the mixing between mesons of different isospin\nwhen the distribution functions of the protons and neutrons differ. As a consequence, the Dyson\nequation (13) acquires a more complex structure. The formulae needed for the calculation of the\nmixed polarizations and meson propagators were given in [40].\nThe polarizations calculated in the linear response analysis coincide with those available in\nthe litterature from the Green function formalism at zero temperature and in symmetric nuclear\nmatter. At finite temperature, the real parts coincide, but some precisions are necessary concerning\nthe imaginary parts. In the real time formalism [28], one defines the Green function, and self\nenergies as 2x2 matrices with the indices labelling the two branches of the time contour. The\nvarious components are related to each other. In this paper, we chose to work with the retarded\npolarization.\nPolarizations are generally obtained under the form of a \"density dependent\" and a \"vacuum fluctuation\" term. This latter part entails divergences which have to be subtracted by some\nrenormalization procedure. Regularization of divergences ocurring in vacuum polarization may\nbe performed through the inclusion of a counterterm lagrangian with couplings adjusted so as to\ncancel the infinities. The subtraction is defined up to some residual finite constant, which is then\ndetermined by choosing a renormalization point where the polarization and its derivatives with\nrespect to the momentum and effective mass is required to vanish.\n5\n\n\fThe criteria guiding this choice will have to be reexamined in the light of the recent advances\nconcerning effective field theories. As a matter of fact, the various possible renormalization schemes\nunfortunately lead to discrepancies observed among the results available in the litterature. A\nparticularly distressing example was the case of the \u03c1 meson discussed in [38]. One cannot ignore\nthe problem, since simply eliminating the vacuum by a normal reordering produces pathologies in\nthe dispersion relation. The problem roots in the fact that we are working in an effective theory,\nwhich is non renormalizable in the usual QED sense. A renormalization can still be performed at\na given order. Nevertheless, the parameters of the theory, which are adjusted so as to reproduce\navailable experimental data, should enforce the symmetries and scalings of the integrated degrees\nof freedom of the underlying more fundamental theory. There is some hope that one could solve\nthe problem using \"naturalness\" arguments [41]. Fortunately, as we will see in section \u00a73, our final\nresult has only a negligibly weak dependence in the choice of the renormalization condition.\nThe polarization which enters the definition of the differential neutrino-nucleon scattering cross\nsection may be decomposed onto orthogonal projectors, formed with the vectors and tensor available\nin the problem, i.e. the metric g\u03bc\u03bd = diag (1, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121), the hydrodynamic velocity u\u03bc and the\ntransferred momentum q \u03bc .\ne \u03bc\u03bd = \u03a0\ne T T \u03bc\u03bd + \u03a0\ne L \u039b\u03bc\u03bd + \u03a0\ne Q Q\u03bc\u03bd + i \u03a0\ne E E \u03bc\u03bd\n\u03a0\nWW\n\n\u039b\u03bc\u03bd\n\nwith\n\n\u03b7\u03bc \u03b7\u03bd\n\u03b72\n\n=\n\n;\n\n\u03b7 \u03bc = u\u03bc \u2212\n\n(15)\n\nq.u \u03bc\nq\nq2\n\n\u03b7\u03bc \u03b7\u03bd\nq\u03bcq\u03bd\n\u2212\n\u03b72\nq2\nE \u03bc\u03bd = \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03bb \u03b7\u03c1 q\u03bb\nq\u03bcq\u03bd\n(16)\nQ\u03bc\u03bd =\nq2\nThe imaginary unit i appearing before the antisymmetric tensor E \u03bc\u03bd combines with the i present\nin the corresponding term of the lepton current, so that the product involves the imaginary part\nof the polarization \u03a0E .

Even though it is weaker than in the nonrelativistic\nformulation, it remains a spurious effect, since no such effect is observed experimentally. When\nanalyzing the structure of the pion potential, it is seen that this is related to the short range behavior. The introduction of the short range effects actually should come out of a full many-body\ncalculation. Nevertheless, it is a common practice to implement it by the definition of a residual\ninteraction. In the non relativistic formalism, one adds the Landau-Migdal contact interaction\nVC = g\u2032 (f\u03c0 /m\u03c0 )2 \u03b4(r)\u03c31 .\u03c32 .

The axial-vector structure function R5 appears only in a relativistic treatment.\nThe \"vector\" structure function R1 involves the sigma meson and the longitudinal part of the\nomega meson, as well as the longitudinal part of the rho. The contribution of the latter meson\nis negligible in this channel. As is known from previous studies, a zero sound mode appears in\nthe mixed \u03c3-\u03c9 dispersion relation. It manifests itself as a pole in the RPA meson propagator. At\nfinite temperature, it is quenched by Landau damping. As an example, the longitudinal response\nfunction was represented on Fig. 1 at twice the saturation density and at a temperature T = 30\nMeV for a fixed exchanged 3-momentum k = 100 MeV. The longitudinal response function is\nsuppressed in the RPA approximation (full line) as compared to the mean field approximation\n(dashed line). The zero-sound appears as a peak at the high frequency edge of the distribution\nstrength. Note, however, that this mode will lie mostly outside of the integration range when we\ncalculate the mean free path. Indeed, the fact that the exchanged momentum must be spacelike\nrestricts the frequency to \u03c9 2 < k2 ; moreover, the condition on the scattering angle \u22121 < cos \u03b8 < 1\nimposes that k2 < (2E\u03bd \u2212 \u03c9)2 . The integration range is therefore restricted to k \u2208 [0, \u221e[ and\n\u03c9 \u2208 [\u2212k, min(k, 2E\u03bd \u2212 k)] or, equivalently, \u03c9 \u2208 [\u2212\u221e, E\u03bd ] and k \u2208 [|\u03c9|, 2E\u03bd \u2212 \u03c9].\nThe RPA correction to the transverse polarization is mostly determined by the \u03c1 meson, whereas\nthe \u03c3 and \u03c9 mesons contribution to this quantity remains small.

The results of Fig. 2 were obtained for a density\ntwice that of saturation, a temperature 30 MeV and at a fixed value of the 3-momentum 100 MeV.\nWe find that the dependence in the Landau-Migdal parameter g\u2032 is very small, when it is\nintroduced through a contact Lagrangian (CL), in contrast with the results reported in [13, 17].\nThe dashed line representing our RPA result is unchanged at the level of precision of the figure\nwhether we take g\u2032 = 0.6 or g \u2032 = 0. A tentative explanation for this discrepancy could be the fact\nthat the later references [13, 17] are using Horowitz Ansatz (HA). Indeed, when the \u03c0-\u03c1 mixings\nand transversal projection of the \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03c0 tensor introduced through the inversion of Eq. (19) are kept\nin the equations, we would obtain the dotted line of Fig. 2 represented for g\u2032 = 0.6 These terms\nactually would dominate over the other contributions from the \u03c1 meson, and would be responsible\nfor a strong suppression of the transverse response function. They are proportional to g\u2032 . As was\nargued in the preceding section and in [39] however, these contributions are spurious and should\nbe subtracted. This could be the reason for the strong g\u2032 dependence observed by the authors of\n[13, 17], and of the large reduction factors obtained in the RPA approximation in these references.\nWe believe that this point needs to be investigated further.\nAs discussed in the previous section, the polarizations entering the definition of the dressed\n9\n\n\f3.5\n3\nR5 (\u03c9,k) [10 4 MeV 2 ]\n\nRPA\nMF\n\nT=30 MeV\nn B = 2 n sat\nk=100 MeV\n\n2.5\n2\n\nFig. 3 \u2013 Structure function\nR5, displaying a shift towards\nlower frequencies\n\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n-80\n\n-60\n\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n\u03c9 [MeV]\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nmeson propagators in the RPA approximation contain a contribution from the vacuum fluctuations which needs to be renormalized. At the present time, there exist some discrepancies in the\nlitterature concerning the choice of a renormalization procedure. As discussed e.g. in [38, 39],\nthis is a source of uncertainty in the determination of the dispersion relations of the mesons in the\nframework of hadronic models, and in particular in the prediction of the behavior of the effective\n\u03c1 meson mass in the medium. We refer the reader to [38, 39, 40, 42, 43] for details. Before we\nproceed, it is necessary to know in what measure does this issue affect the results presented in\nthis work. Accordingly, we calculated the response functions in three cases. A first case consists\nof simply dropping the vacuum term (which is equivalent to perform a normal ordering). In the\nsecond case, (\"scheme A\" in this work) we chose a renormalization scheme as used by Kurasawa\nand Suzuki [42] which minimizes the coupling to counterterms on the q 2 = 0 shell. In the third\ncase, we used a renormalization procedure which preserved the formal structure of the expressions\nof the vacuum polarizations as a function of the effective nucleon mass (\"scheme 3\" of [38], called\n\"scheme B\" in this work).\n2.5\n\nR 1(\u03c9,k) [10 4 MeV 2 ]\n\n2\n\nMean field\nno vacuum\nRPA scheme A\nscheme B\n\nT=30 MeV\nn B = 2 n sat\nk=100 MeV\n\n{\n\n1.5\n\nFig. 4 \u2013 Effect of renormalization scheme on longitudinal\nstructure function\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n-80\n\n-60\n\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n\u03c9 [MeV]\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nThe choice of the renormalization procedure has some small influence on the longitudinal R1\nresponse function. As seen on Fig. 4, its main effect is to modify the strength and position of the\n10\n\n\fzero-sound mode. It was however argued above that the contribution of the zero sound mode to the\nneutrino-nucleon scattering is only marginal, since its characteristic frequency lies mostly outside\nof the values kinematically allowed for neutrino-nucleon scattering. Moreover, as will be seen in the\nnext paragraph, the longitudinal reponse is not the dominant contribution to the neutrino-nucleon\nscattering. The structure functions R2 and R5 are not appreciably affected by the choice of the\nrenormalization scheme. The difference between one or the other schemes are of the order of the\nfraction of a percent and therefore not distinguishable on the scale of the figures. As a consequence,\nwe are able to conclude that the vacuum fluctuations will not affect the neutrino-nucleon scattering\nopacity in any appreciable way.\n\n3.2\n\nDifferential cross section\n\nThe differential cross section can now be calculated from Eq. (7) by inserting the previous results\nfor the longitudinal, transverse and axial vector polarizations. It is instructive to compare the\nrelative magnitude of their contributions, which are displayed\nin Fig. 5. The result is rescaled by\n\u0001\n2 E 2 /\u03c0 [44]. The transverse contribution is\ndividing it by the textbook estimate \u03c30 = G2F CV2 + 3CA\n\u03bd\ndominant and will provide for about 60 % of the total result. We find that it is very little modified\nby RPA correlations. The corrections arise from the subdominant longitudinal and axial-vector\npolarizations \u03a0L and \u03a0E . The longitudinal contribution is affected by a reduction factor of about\ntwo. We notice at the right and left ends of the figure two small peaks which arise from the zerosound mode excitation. The contribution of the axial-vector response function is only marginal at\nthe density (nB = 2 nsat ) chosen in this figure, although it is larger at higher density. It is slightly\nenhanced by RPA correlations and its strength is shifted towards lower values of the energy loss\nof the neutrino \u03c9 = E\u03bd \u2212 E\u03bd\u2032 , thus acting to counterbalance the reduction from the longitudinal\ncontribution.\n0.8\n\n(1/\u03c30 ) (d2 \u03c3\u03bdn / dE d\u03a9) [MeV-1 ]\n\n0.7\n\nMF-L\nRPA-L\nMF-T\nRPA-T\nMF-E\nRPA-E\n\nT=30 MeV\nn B = 2 n sat\nk=25 MeV\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\nFig. 5 \u2013 Relative contributions\nof longitudinal, transverse and\naxial vector polarizations to the\ndifferential scattering cross section\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n-0.8\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0\n\n\u03c9/k\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nAs a conclusion to this preliminary study, we gather here the main results of the section. We are\nable to report that the choice of renormalization scheme does not affect the results more than on\n11\n\n\fthe level of less than 1 %. Further good news is that our results are also insensitive to the choice of\nthe residual contact (Landau-Migdal) interaction. The transverse response function is left almost\nunchanged by RPA correlations, while the longidudinal and axial vector responses are reduced by\nabout a factor of two. Since the transverse structure function yields the dominant contribution to\nthe neutrino-nucleon scattering, we do not expect spectacular modifications from RPA correlations\nas compared to the mean field result.\n\n4\n\nFull model - Asymmetric nuclear matter\n\nUp to now, we have made the simplifying assumption of pure neutron matter. We now pass to\ndescribe a more realistic model, where the proton fraction is defined by the physical conditions in\nthe star. The proton fraction is defined by\nYp =\n\n\u03c1p\n\u03c1p + \u03c1n\n\n(38)\n\nwhere \u03c1p and \u03c1n are the proton and neutron densities. Numerical calculations show that the\nchemical equilibrium is reached very rapidly. The proton fraction will therefore be determined\nby \u03b2 equilibrium. As a rule of thumb, in cooled neutron stars, the neutrinos can leave the star\nunhindered, and we have Yp \u2243 0.1. On the other hand, in supernovae the neutrinos are still trapped\ndynamically inside the matter on the diffusion time scale and contribute to displace the equilibrium\nto higher ratios of the proton fraction Yp \u2243 0.3.\nThe asymmetry enters at several levels in the calculation of the neutrino nucleon scattering\ncross section. It first enters in the determination of the thermodynamics: we have kF p 6= kF n , and\nalso Mp 6= Mn in a model with \u03b4 meson exchange. It also enters in the polarizations, e.g we must\n(nn)\n(pp)\nsum the proton and neutron contributions in polarizations such \u03a0\u03c3 = \u03a0\u03c3 + \u03a0\u03c3 . Moreover, new\nmixing channels occur which are not present in symmetric matter. They arise from polarizations\ninvolving vertices with mesons of different isospin, which are given by the difference between the\n(pp)\n(nn)\nproton and neutron contributions, such as e.g. \u03a0\u03c3\u03c1 = \u03a0\u03c3\u03c1 \u2212 \u03a0\u03c3\u03c1 in longitudinal modes or\n(pp)\n(nn)\n\u03a0\u03c9\u03c1 = \u03a0\u03c9\u03c1 \u2212 \u03a0\u03c9\u03c1 in transverse modes.\n\n4.1\n\nThermodynamics\n\nThe basic properties of nuclear matter can be reproduced at the mean field level with \u03c3, \u03c9 and \u03c1\nmeson exchange, when non linear sigma meson couplings 1/3bm\u03c3 3 + 1/4c\u03c3 4 are taken into account\nin order to obtain a better value of the compressibility (see e.g. [45]).\nThe \u03b4 meson also appears in meson exchange models such as the Bonn potential [46, 47]. Since\nthe \u03b4 meson carries isospin, it can give important contributions in strongly asymmetric matter.\nMoreover, when density dependent mean field models are adjusted in order to reproduce the most\nrecent Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock calculations, it is seen that a \u03b4 meson is needed in order to\nreproduce the results at finite asymmetry [48, 49]. The behavior of the equation of state when a\n\u03b4 meson is present was studied by Kubis and Kutschera [50]. The \u03b4 meson is at the origin of a\ndifference between the neutron and the proton effective masses.\nMn = m \u2212 g\u03c3 \u03c3 + g\u03b4 \u03b4\n\n, Mp = m \u2212 g\u03c3 \u03c3 \u2212 g\u03b4 \u03b4\n\n(39)\n\nOn the other hand, it brings a negative contribution to the asymmetry energy, so that the coupling\nto the \u03c1 meson has to be readjusted to a higher value to compensate for that effect.\nIn this work, the strength of the \u03b4 coupling g\u03b4 will be fixed to the Bonn potential value [46]\n2\ng\u03b4 /4\u03c0 = 1.1075. The couplings g\u03c3 , g\u03c9 , g\u03c1 , b, c were adjusted [40] so as to reproduce the experimental\n12\n\n\fsaturation point with\n\u03c10 = 0.17 fm\u22123 ,\n\nB/A = \u221216 MeV,\n\nK = 250 MeV,\n\nm\u2217 /m = 0.8,\n\naA = 30 MeV\n\n(40)\n\nc = 7.847 10\u22123 ,\n\ng\u03c1 = 4.59\n\n(41)\n\nand take the values\ng\u03c3 = 8.00,\n\nb = 9.637 10\u22123 ,\n\ng\u03c9 = 7.667,\n\nThe ratio \u03ba\u03c1 = f\u03c1 /g\u03c1 was fixed to the Bonn value \u03ba\u03c1 = 6.1.\nThe proton fraction is determined by the \u03b2 equilibrium condition \u03bc\u0302 = \u03bcn \u2212 \u03bcp = \u03bce \u2212 \u03bc\u03bd .\nIf neutrinos are trapped inside matter, the chemical potential of the neutrino has a finite value\n\u03bc\u03bd = (6\u03c0 2 \u03c1Y\u03bd )1/3 . For a typical value of the lepton fraction YL = Y\u03bd + Ye = 0.4, \u03bc\u03bd is of the\norder of 200-250 MeV and the proton fraction Yp of the order of \u223c 0.3 - 0.36. YL is determined by\nneutrino transport (e.g., diffusion equation), to which the neutrino-nucleon cross section serves as\ninput. If the matter is transparent to neutrinos, \u03bc\u03bd = 0 and the proton fraction is of the order of\n\u223c 0.1.

The two cases of neutrino free\nmatter (Y\u03bd = 0) or matter with trapped neutrinos (YL = 0.4) are displayed. All figures were drawn\nassuming a vanishing temperature. The upper left panel shows the evolution of the proton fraction\nas a function of the baryon density. The upper right panel shows the behavior of the proton and\nneutron effective masses. The difference Mp \u2212Mn is larger in neutrino free matter since it allows for\na smaller proton fraction and therefore a larger mean \u03b4 field. On the lower panel are represented the\ndifference between the chemical potentials of the neutron and the proton \u03bc\u0302 in the cases (Y\u03bd = 0)\nand (YL = 0.4) as a full line. In matter with a trapped lepton fraction YL = 0.4, the neutrino\nchemical potential is non vanishing; it is compared to \u03bc\u0302 on Fig. 6-(c). The full line was obtained\nfor a coupling to the \u03b4 field g\u03b4 = 5. If this coupling is set to zero, the chemical potentials are given\nby the dashed lines on Fig. 6-(c).\n\n4.2\n\nMeson mixing\n\nThe dispersion relations of the \u03c3-\u03c9-\u03b40 -\u03c10 system of neutral mesons, which is relevant for the calculation of the neutrino-nucleon scattering through the neutral current process, were studied in [40].\nAs discussed in this reference, the difference existing between the neutron and proton distribution\nfunctions makes mixing possible in all chanels in asymmetric matter. The pion does not mix with\nthe other mesons, and, as pointed out in section \u00a73, its contributions to the \u03bd-N scattering process\nvanishes, so we will not consider it further.

The calculation\nproceeds as in section \u00a73. The longitudinal projection of the RPA correction to the polarization\nnow receives contributions from the \u03b4 meson and from all possible combinations of the mixings,\nthat is, not only from \u03c3-\u03c9 and \u03b4-\u03c1 already present in symmetric matter, but also from \u03b4-\u03c3, \u03c3-\u03c1, \u03c9-\u03c1\nand \u03c9-\u03b4 mixings. The transversal T and axial vector E components receive additional contributions\nfrom \u03c9-\u03c1 mixing. Finally, the projection parallel to q \u03bc q \u03bd vanishes through contraction with the\n(massless) lepton current, it would contain the contribution of the pion.\nThe expressions of Im (\u03a0R \u03bc\u03bd L\u03bc\u03bd ) so obtained are introduced in the formula for the differential\ncross section (7). We calculated separately the longitudinal, transverse and axial-vector contributions to the differential cross section and represent them in Fig. 7 as a function of the ratio of\nthe neutrino loss energy to the transferred three momentum k = 50 MeV. The thermodynamical\nconditions were chosen to be those of neutrino free matter (Y\u03bd = 0) with a density n = 4 nsat and\nfinite temperature T =20 MeV. The transferred 4-momentum is subject to kinematical constraints\nwhich restrict the range over which it will be integrated in order to obtain the total cross section\nand the mean free path (see next section). The limit of the integration range is also represented\non Fig. 7.\nIt is seen from these figures that the contribution of the longitudinal polarization is appreciably\naffected by meson mixing. The longitudinal modes involve the full \u03c3 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2212 \u03b4 \u2212 \u03c1 mixing. The\nmixing is stronger at high asymmetry, high density and high momentum transfer. There exists as\nbefore a zero sound mode, but it is undiscernible on the figures, because it is partially washed out\nby Landau damping and lies outside of the integration range.\nThe transverse and axial vector contributions involve only \u03c1\u2212\u03c9 mixing in the transverse modes.\nThe modification to the transverse contribution is small in the kinematically allowed region.

We obtain that the dominant contribution to the neutrino-nucleon scattering\ncross section, that is the transverse one, is hardly modified by the RPA corrections as compared\nto the mean field approximation. The RPA corrections affect the longitudinal and axial vector\ncomponents, the longitudinal part beeing suppressed and the axial part enhanced with respect to\nthe mean field approximation, and partially cancelling each other. The effect of meson mixing is of\nthe order of 20 % on both the longitudinal and axial vector parts, but further act counterbalance\neach other. The net result is that we do not expect dramatic corrections to the global result from\nRPA correlations.\n\n4.3\n\nMean free path\n\nFinally, we will calculate the contribution of neutrino-nucleon scattering to the mean free path,\nsince it gives an immediate feeling of the phenomenon of opacity when it is compared with the\nlength scales typical of the star, e.g. the star radius or a typical convection length scale. We\nmust naturally stress the fact that this is only an estimate. As a matter a fact, several other\nprocesses, like neutrino emision and absorption through charged current, scattering on electrons,\nBremsstrahlung ... contribute to the definition of the actual mean free path.\nThe mean free path is defined here as the inverse of the total cross section per unit volume\nobtained by integrating the differential cross section calculated in the preceding sections.\n1\n\u03bb(E\u03bd )\n\nG2 1\n= \u2212 F2 2\n32\u03c0 E\u03bd\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nqdq\n\nZ\n\n\u03c9max\n\nd\u03c9\n\n\u2212k\n\n15\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(1 \u2212 f (E\u03bd\u2032 ))\n\u03b1\u03b2 R\nIm\nL\n\u03a0\n\u03b1\u03b2\n1 \u2212 e\u2212z\n\n(43)\n\n\fwith \u03c9max = min(2E\u03bd \u2212 k, k)\n(1 \u2212 f (E\u03bd\u2032 ) = (1 + exp[(E\u03bd\u2032 \u2212 \u03bc\u03bd )/T ])) is a Pauli blocking factor for the outgoing lepton. The\nchemical potential \u03bc\u03bd is determined by \u03b2 equilibrium and by neutrino transport equations (e.g.,\ndiffusion equation), which determine the lepton fraction YL at a given instant of the protoneutron\nstar cooling.\nIn the following figure (Fig. 8), we represented the ratio of total cross sections as calculated in\nthe RPA and mean field approximations. The chosen thermodynamical conditions are representative of the earlier stage of the cooling, when the neutrinos are still trapped inside the matter (the\nlefpton fraction was chosen to be YL =0.4, for typical values of the temperature (T = 20 MeV) and\ndensity (n = 4 nsat ). The neutrino energy was fixed to E\u03bd = 30 MeV.\n1\n\n\u03c3\u03c9 and \u03b4\u03c1 mixing only\nfull \u03c3\u03c9\u03b4\u03c1 mixing\n\n\u03c3RPA /\u03c3 MF\n\n0.98\n0.96\n\nY L=0.4, E\u03bd =30 MeV, T=20 MeV\n\nFig. 8 \u2013 Reduction factor in matter with trapped neutrinos\n\n0.94\n0.92\n0.9\n0.88\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n3.5\nn B / n sat\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\nAt high density, the total neutrino-neutron scattering cross section is found to be reduced by\nRPA correlations by a factor (only) \u223c 10%. When full meson mixing is taken into account, the\nreduction is even smaller. This value should be compared to suppression factors of the order of\ntwo quoted in recent publications [13, 17]. A tentative explanation for this discrepancy was given\nin section \u00a73. Further investigation on this issue is needed.\nThe mean free path obtained from the integration of (43) is shown on Fig. 9 in matter with\ntrapped neutrinos as a function of density for various values of the temperature. At high density,\nthe mean free path is somewhat lenghtened by RPA correlations as compared to the mean field\nvalue. At low density and moderate temperature, on the other hand, RPA correlations would yield\nan enhancement of the cross section and a reduction of the mean free path. A similar behavior\nwas reported in [17]. It should be kept in mind, however, that the validity of the model becomes\nquestionable in this range.\n\n5\n\nSummary and perspectives\n\nLet us gather here the main results obtained in this work. Special attention was paid to the issues\nof renormalization of the Dirac sea, residual interactions in the tensor channel and meson mixing. It\nhas been shown that the vacuum fluctuations have only a negligible effect on the scattering rate. We\nexamined two different prescriptions to introduce the contact term in the tensor channel, and argue\nthat, when properly taken into account, the numerical value of the Landau-Migdal parameter does\nnot affect the structure functions. As a consequence, the transverse contribution to the scattering\n16\n\n\f200\nEnu=30 MeV\nYL=0.4\n\nMF\nRPA\n\nT=5 MeV\n\n100\n\n50\nmean free path [meters]\n\nT=10 MeV\n\nFig. 9 \u2013 Mean free path in matter with\ntrapped neutrinos\n\n20\nT=20 MeV\n10\n\n5\nT=50 MeV\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5 3 3.5\nnB/nsat\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\nrate is basically unchanged, while the contributions coming from the longitudinal and axial-vector\nparts combine to produce a 10% to 15 % reduction of the scattering rate with respect to the mean\nfield approximation.\nA natural extension of this work concerns the absorption and emission cross section by the\ncharged current reaction in the RPA approximation. This is presently under study.\nAs the density increases, a more complete description should include the hyperons \u039b, \u03a3\u2212 .\nTaking into account these baryons does not present any particular difficulty, since the structure of\nthe equations is the same, only with different values of the coupling constants. This has been done\nin [33, 51]. As these authors argue moreover, the high fraction of trapped neutrinos and relatively\nhot temperatures both conspire to strongly suppress the formation of exotic, strangeness carrying\nparticles, so that these are not expected to have a strong influence on the first few seconds of the\nlife of the protoneutron star. Nevertheless, the exoticas will be determinant on the later stage of\nthe protoneutron star cooling, at t \u2243 30\u221260 s, which are marginally or will soon become observable\nwith the next generation of neutrino detectors now on construction, such as UNO.\nA more important problem is to arrive to an accurate description of the short range correlations.\nThese have been studied separately from RPA corrections by several autors (see eg. [19, 20, 23, 24]).\nThe calculated correction factors to the neutrino opacities are large, especially in the low density\n17\n\n\fregime. This is in fact related to the well-known problem of nuclear matter descriptions, which\nshould simultaneously take into account short and long range corrections, \"ladders\" and \"loops\",\nin a consistent way. While methods do exist to do so [52], at least in an approximate way, they are\nquite unwieldy, especially in the relativistic formulation. Some results in this direction have been\nreported recently in [23].\nIn matter at subnuclear density, and also at high density, the homogeneous phase may not\nbe the most stable state of matter. It will therefore be important to study the role of ordered\nconfigurations, as coherent scattering is expected to dominate in this regime. At low density, and\nsufficiently low temperatures, the spinodal instasbility triggers condensation of droplets of a denser\nphase in a more dilute gas principally composed of neutrons. The droplets take a spatially ordered\nconfiguration due to Coulomb forces. This will eventually form the crust of the cooled neutron\nstar. At high density, there are various possibilities of forming ordered structures. For example, if\na transition to quark gluon plasma takes place, an important fraction of the matter of star can be\nin a mixed phase, and will acquire an ordered structure similar to that present in the crust [45].\nAnother possibility is the formation of a pion condensate in the alternating spin layer configuration\n[53]. In any case, such structures are generally unfavored by temperature and high lepton (and\nproton) fractions, so that the same remark as done before applies: this type of correction are\nexpected to set in at a later phase of the protoneutron star cooling. It could be very interesting\nonce we are able to detect the tail of the neutrino emission from a supernova event; if a sudden\nchange in the neutrino would occur, it could be interpreted as a signal that a phase transition has\ntaken place.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supprted in part by the Spanish Grants no MCT-00-BFM-0357, DGES PB971432 and AEN 99-0692.\n\nReferences\n[1] A.
