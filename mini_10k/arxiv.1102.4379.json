It is commonly\nbelieved that near this singularity the physical evolution is governed by quantum mechanics.\nIn the quantum cosmology framework the whole universe is represented through a wave\nfunction satisfying the Wheeler-DeWitt equation [1]. It is well known that it represents\nthe low energy approximation of string theory, however it contains some non-trivial leading\norder information. The development of quantum cosmology started at the beginning of the\n80's of last century and one of its main ideas is that the universe could be spontaneously\nnucleate out from nothing [2\u201310]. After nucleation the universe can enter into a phase of\ninflationary expansion and continues its evolution to the present time. However, there are\nseveral important questions that remain to be solved like the general definition of probability,\ntime and boundary conditions [11]. In order to find a unique solution of the WheelerDeWitt equation it is necessary to impose boundary conditions. In the case of quantum\nmechanics there is an external setup and the boundary conditions can be imposed safely,\nhowever in 4-dimensional quantum cosmology there is nothing external to the universe and\nthe question of which one is the correct prescription for the boundary condition of the\nuniverse is controversial [12]. There are several proposals for the correct boundary conditions\nin quantum cosmology, for example, the no-boundary proposal of Hartle and Hawking [7], the\ntunneling proposal of Vilenkin [10] and the proposal of Linde [8]. In a recent development\nin quantum cosmology a principle of selection in the landscape of string vacua has been\nproposed in [13], in the context of the minisuperspace. Moreover in [14] different cosmologies\nwere defined in terms of a wave function on a compact worldsheet of system of parafermions.\nMuch of the information is encoded in the wave function as function of the moduli space.\nAnother important issue is how to extract information of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation.\nIn general, the configuration space used in quantum cosmology is an infinite dimensional\nspace called superspace and it is not amenable to work with. In the study of homogeneous\nuniverses the infinite dimensional space is truncated to finite degrees of freedom, therefore\nobtaining a particular minisuperspace model. The reduction of superspace to minisuperspace is not a rigorous approximation scheme, however there is the hope that minisuperspace\nmaintains some of the essential features of quantum cosmology. In classical cosmology homogeneity and isotropy are fundamental to describe the universe at large scale and therefore\n\n2\n\n\fit is expected to have a minisuperspace description in quantum cosmology.\nAt very early times of the universe, even before the Planck time, the universe should be\ndescribed by means of quantum cosmology that could take into account effects from string\ntheory, supersymmetry and noncommutativity. String cosmology [15], quantum wormholes,\nbaby universes and supersymmetric quantum cosmology has become very intensive research\nareas in quantum cosmology. Quantum wormholes [16] are instanton solutions and are\nimportant in the Euclidean path integral formulation. In the third quantization approach,\nwhich is an adequate description of topology change in the path integral quantization, the\nwave function is transformed into a quantum field operator which includes operators that\ncreate and destroy the so called baby universes.\nSupersymmetric quantum cosmology is one of the main research areas [17\u201320]. At the\ntime of quantum creation of the universe it is possible that supersymmetry would not yet\nbe broken and therefore could have very important consequences in the evolution of the\nuniverse. Other very interesting effects that could arise in the very early universe are the\neffects of noncommutativity [21].\nAt the end of the late 1980s and early 1990s quantum decoherence, the transition from\nquantum physics to classical physics, was an active research area in quantum cosmology\n[22, 23] (for more recent reviews see, [24, 25]). In Refs. [26\u201330], quantum cosmology is\ndeveloped in the phase space and the use of Wigner function is showed to be a very useful\napproach to study decoherence. In fact, quantum mechanics in phase space is an appropriate\nformalism to describe quantum mechanical systems (for a review see [31]). The description\nusing the Wigner function has been of considerable interest and usefulness in quantum optics,\nnuclear and particle physics, condensed matter, statistical physics, etc. In particular, the\ndescription of semiclassical properties and the analysis of the classical limit is more clear in\nthe Wigner function formalism. The classical limit from quantum cosmology was studied\nalso in [30, 32], where the use of Wigner function and quantum mechanics in phase space\nis fundamental. It has been argued that quantum decoherence is achieved if the density\nmatrix is coarse grained, i.e. averaged over configuration or phase space variables, or in\nan alternative way, if the system interact with some environment which is not monitored.\nHowever the existence of classical correlations is another characteristic of the classical limit\nand requires the presence of sharp peaks of the Wigner function, but a coarse graining\nproduces a spreading of the distribution in phase space. The former arguments demand a\n3\n\n\fsubtle coarse graining in which there is a delicate balance between the existence of classical\ncorrelations and decoherence. A coarse graining could be modeled by a Liouville equation\nwith friction and diffusion terms [30]. Some other further results are described in Refs.\n[33, 34].\nThe quantum mechanics in phase space is only one part of a complete and consistent\ntype of quantization termed: deformation quantization. In this paper we formulate quantum\ncosmology in terms of deformation quantization and rewrite some results of [30, 32] in the\ncontext of this formalism. We will assume that the superspace (of 3-metrics) is flat and\na Fourier transform can be defined. This is fairly valid for the ample set of examples in\ntwo dimensions that we present in this paper. The case of curved minisuperspace will be\ndiscussed in a future communication.\nThe deformation quantization formalism is an alternative approach to the canonical and\npath integral quantizations and has its origins in the seminal works by Weyl [35], Wigner\n[36], Groenewold [37], Moyal [38], and Vey [39], and is based on the idea of treating with\nquantum mechanics on the phase space. In 1978 Bayen, Flato, Fronsdal, Lichnerowicz\nand Sternheimer [40] introduced its final form in which the quantization is understood as\na deformation of the classical algebra of observables instead of a change in the nature of\nthem. This quantization arises as a deformation of the usual product algebra of the smooth\nfunctions on the classical phase space and then as a deformation of the Poisson bracket\nalgebra. The deformed product is called the ?\u2212product which has been proved to exist\nfor any symplectic manifold [41], [42] and more recently shown by Kontsevich [43] that it\nalso exists for any Poisson manifold. These results in principle allow us to perform the\nquantization of arbitrary Poissonian or symplectic systems and to obtain in an easier way\nthe classical limit due to the nature of the ?\u2212product. Our aim is to introduce this formalism\nin quantum cosmology and apply the results to simple models.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In section II we survey the canonical Hamiltonian\nformalism of general relativity and its canonical quantization. In section III we construct the\nStratonovich-Weyl quantizer, the star-product and the Wigner functional. Section IV is devoted to apply the deformation quantization procedure to several minisuperspace models and\nto obtain their Wigner function. In subsection IV.A we treat de Sitter model and calculate\nnumerically the Wigner function for the Hartle-Hawking, Vilenkin and Linde wave functions.\nIn subsection IV.B we calculate analytically the Wigner function for the Kantowski-Sachs\n4\n\n\fmodel in (non)commutative quantum cosmology and we interpret the results. In subsection\nIV.C, we obtain the Wigner function for string cosmology with dilaton exponential potential\nin terms of the Meijer's function. Besides, in subsection IV.D the Wigner function for the\nbaby universes solutions is calculated by means of the Moyal product and the annihilation\nand creation operators. Finally, in section V we give our final remarks.\n\nII.\n\nCANONICAL FORMALISM OF GENERAL RELATIVITY\n\nIn this section we briefly overview the Hamiltonian formalism of general relativity. Our\npresentation will not be complete and detailed information can be found in Ref. [1, 44].\nOur intention is only to introduce the notation and conventions for future reference along\nthe paper.\n\nA.\n\nHamiltonian Formalism\n\nWe start from the ADM decomposition of general relativity and consider a pseudo Riemannian manifold (M, g) which is globally hyperbolic. Thus, spacetime M can be decomposed as M = \u03a3 \u00d7 R where \u03a3 is an spatial hypersurface and the metric of a foliation is:\nds2 = g\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd = \u2212(N 2 \u2212 N i Ni )dt2 + 2Ni dxi dt + hij dxi dxj , with signature (\u2212, +, +, +).\nHere hij is the intrinsic metric on the hypersurface \u03a3, N is the lapse function and N i is the\nshift vector.\nThe space of all Riemannian 3-metrics and scalar matter configurations \u03a6 on \u03a3 is the so\ncalled superspace Riem(\u03a3) = {hij (x), \u03a6(x)|x \u2208 \u03a3}. Let us denote the space of Riemannian\nmetrics on \u03a3 as Met(\u03a3) = {hij (x)|x \u2208 \u03a3} which is an infinite dimensional manifold. The\nmoduli space M, is then defined as the configuration space (superspace) modulo the group\nMet(\u03a3)\nor for pure gravity M = Diff(\u03a3)\n.\nThe corresponding phase space (Wheeler's phase superspace) \u0393\u2217 \u223c\n= T \u2217 Met(\u03a3) is given\n\nof diffeomorphisms Diff(\u03a3) i.e. M =\n\nRiem(\u03a3)\nDiff(\u03a3)\n\nby the pairs \u0393\u2217 = {(hij (x), \u03c0 ij (x))}, where \u03c0 ij =\n\n\u2202LEH\n\u2202 \u1e23ij\n\nand LEH is the Einstein-Hilbert\n\nLagrangian.

In this section we describe briefly the general\nprocedure to obtain the quantum equations. In the h-representation, the usual promotion of\ncanonical coordinates hij (x), \u03a6(x) and \u03c0 ij , \u03c0\u03a6 to the operators can be done in the following\nb ij , \u03a6i = \u03a6(x)|hij , \u03a6i and\nform: b\nhij |hij , \u03a6i = hij |hij , \u03a6i, \u03c0\nbij |hij , \u03a6i = \u2212i~ \u03b4hij\u03b4(x) |hij , \u03a6i, \u03a6|h\n\u03b4\n|hij , \u03a6i.

In the general case the Wheeler-DeWitt equation is not amenable\nto extract physical information of the system. In order to obtain useful information it is a\ncommon practice to reduce the number of degrees of freedom. In the following sections we\nwill consider models with one and two degrees of freedom.\n\nIII.\n\nDEFORMATION QUANTIZATION OF WHEELER'S PHASE-SUPERSPACE\n\nIn this section we work in a flat superspace with flat metric Gijkl . This case will allow\nus to introduce the Weyl-Wigner-Groenewold-Moyal (WWGM) formalism for gravitational\nsystems in a direct way since the existence of the Fourier transform is warranted. The more\ncomplicated cases of curved (mini)superspaces will be left for a future work. The deformation\nquantization of gravity in ADM formalism and constrained systems is described in more\n7\n\n\fdetail in Refs. [45]. We want to point out that in this section the calculations are formal\njust as is the case of path integrals in field theory and in order to obtain some physical\nresults additional considerations need to be implemented depending on the specific system.\n\nA.\n\nThe Stratonovich-Weyl Quantizer\n\nLet F [hij , \u03c0 ij ; \u03a6, \u03c0\u03a6 ] be a functional on the phase space \u0393\u2217 (Wheeler's phase superspace)\nand let Fe[\u03bcij , \u03bbij ; \u03bc, \u03bb] be its Fourier transform.

We term Eq. (29) the WheelerDeWitt-Moyal equation. It is important to mention that the dynamics is completely governed by these equations and that their explicit form depends of the particular system\nconsidered. These equations will be useful in the cosmological models which we will discuss in the following section. Also, we want to note that the real and imaginary parts of\nEq. (29), encoded in the ?\u2212product, are the generalized mass condition and the WheelerDeWitt-Vlasov transport equation presented in [29] for flat minisuperspace.\n\nIV.\n\nDEFORMATION QUANTIZATION IN THE MINISUPERSPACE\n\nNow we proceed to study the application of the deformation quantization construction\nto some models in quantum cosmology. The general construction exposed in the previous\nsection in terms of functional integrals is defined in the whole superspace of 3-metrics and\nis necessary in a general case , however as a first approach we will deal with some models\nin the minisuperspace due to their simplicity and because they have been widely studied\nin the literature by other methods. Our intention is to obtain the Wigner function for\nthese important cases and to motivate a further study using deformation quantization. We\nconsider that this first step is necessary in order to gain some experience to eventually\napply the deformation quantization formalism to curved phase-space. It is known that\nthis formalism has a natural extension to these situations (see [42, 43]) and allows another\nsuitable extensions or generalizations.\n\nA.\n\nde Sitter cosmological model\n\nAs a first example we will deal with a minisuperspace model where the phase space is\nbidimensional. We are going to calculate the Wigner function from the Wheeler-DeWittMoyal equation and also from its integral expression. Let start with a minisuperspace (where\n11\n\n\fthe degrees of freedom are reduced to just one represented by the scale factor of the universe)\ncorresponding to the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric\n\u0003\n\u0002\nds2 = lp2 \u2212N 2 dt2 + a2 (t)d\u03a923 ,\n\n(31)\n\nwhere a is the scale factor of the universe, N is the lapse function, d\u03a923 is the metric of the\nunit three-sphere, lp = 2/3Lp and Lp denotes the Planck length. Introducing new variables\nq = a2 and \u00d1 = qN [54] the Hamiltonian H\u22a5 cast out in an easy form\nH\u22a5 =\n\n\u0001\n1\n\u22124p2 + \u03bbq \u2212 1 ,\n2\n\n(32)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the cosmological constant in Planck units. In the coordinate representation the\nHamiltonian acquires a simple form and its dynamics corresponds to a particle in a linear\npotential. The Wheeler-DeWitt equation comes from the Hamiltonian constraint (10) and\nis written as\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nd2\n4} 2 + \u03bbq \u2212 1 \u03a8(q) = 0 .\ndq\n2\n\n(33)\n\nDepending of the boundary conditions it can be found [11] the Vilenkin wave function\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n1\ni\n1 \u2212 \u03bbq\n1 \u2212 \u03bbq\n\u03a8V (q) = Ai\n+ Bi\n,\n(34)\n2\n(2\u03bb})2/3\n2\n(2\u03bb})2/3\nthe Hartle-Hawking wave function\n\u0012\n\u03a8HH (q) = Ai\n\n1 \u2212 \u03bbq\n(2\u03bb})2/3\n\n\u0013\n,\n\n(35)\n\n,\n\n(36)\n\nand the Linde wave function\n\u0012\n\u03a8L (q) = \u2212iBi\n\n1 \u2212 \u03bbq\n(2\u03bb})2/3\n\n\u0013\n\nwhere Ai(x) and Bi(x) are the Airy functions of first and second class respectively.\nOne of the main differences between the Hartle-Hawking, Linde and Vilenkin wave functions is their behavior in the region q > 1/\u03bb. The Vilenkin tunneling wave function has the\nfollowing expression\n\u03a8V = \u03c8\u2212 (q),\n\n(37)\n\n\u03a8HH = \u03c8+ (q) + \u03c8\u2212 (q),\n\n(38)\n\nthe Hartle-Hawking wave function is\n\n12\n\n\fand the Linde wave function is written as\n\u03a8L = \u03c8+ (q) \u2212 \u03c8\u2212 (q),\n\n(39)\n\nwhere \u03c8\u2212 (q), \u03c8+ (q) describe an expanding and contracting universe, respectively. In the\nclassical allowed region q > 1/\u03bb the WKB solutions are\n\u0015\n\u0014 Z q\ni\u03c0\n0\n0\n\u22121/2\n,\np(q )dq \u2213\n\u03c8\u00b1 = [p(q)]\nexp \u00b1i\n4\n1/\u03bb\n\n(40)\n\nwhere p(a) = [\u2212U (a)]1/2 = 21 [\u03bbq \u2212 1]1/2 . From the WKB wave function (40) we have\np\u0302\u03c8\u00b1 (q) \u2248 \u00b1p\u03c8\u00b1 (q).\n\n(41)\n\nTaking into account that\nq\u0307\n,\n(42)\n4\u00d1\nthe Eq. (41) confirms the already given interpretation for \u03c8\u00b1 (q), i.e. negative values of\np=\u2212\n\np correspond to an expanding universe. Therefore, the Vilenkin wave function includes\nonly an expanding component while the Hartle-Hawking and Linde wave functions include\nexpanding and contracting universes with equal weight (for a different interpretation see\n[55]). In fact, for large values of q these wave functions have the following expressions\n\u03a8V (q) \u2248\n\n(2\u03bb~)1/6\ne\u2212iS ,\n2\n1/4\n2[\u03c0 (\u03bbq \u2212 1)]\n\n(43)\n\n\u03a8HH (q) \u2248\n\n\u0001\n(2\u03bb~)1/6\n(2\u03bb~)1/6\ncos\nS\n=\neiS + e\u2212iS ,\n2\n1/4\n2\n1/4\n[\u03c0 (\u03bbq \u2212 1)]\n2[\u03c0 (\u03bbq \u2212 1)]\n\n(44)\n\n\u03a8L (q) \u2248 i\n\n\u0001\n(2\u03bb~)1/6\n(2\u03bb~)1/6\neiS \u2212 e\u2212iS ,\nsin\nS\n=\n2\n1/4\n2\n1/4\n[\u03c0 (\u03bbq \u2212 1)]\n2[\u03c0 (\u03bbq \u2212 1)]\n\n(45)\n\nwhere\nS=\n\n1\n\u03c0\n(\u03bbq \u2212 1)3/2 \u2212 .\n3\u03bb~\n4\n\n(46)\n\nNow we proceed to calculate the Wigner function directly by solving the Wheeler-DeWittMoyal equation (29)\nH\u22a5 ? \u03c1W = 0.\nwhere the corresponding Moyal ?\u2212product is given by\n\uf8f1 \uf8eb\u2190 \u2192\n\uf8f6\uf8fc\n\u2190 \u2192\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\uf8f2\ni} \u2194\ni} \uf8ed \u2202 \u2202\n\u2202 \u2202 \uf8f8\uf8fd\nP = exp\n\u2212\n.\n? = exp\n\uf8f3 2 \u2202q \u2202p \u2202p \u2202q \uf8fe\n2\n13\n\n(47)\n\n(48)\n\n\fTaking in consideration the exponential power series expansion we have\n\"\u221e\n#\nX 1 \u0012 i} \u0013n \u2194 n\n1\n(\u22124p2 + \u03bbq \u2212 1)\nP \u03c1W = 0 ,\n2\nn!\n2\nn=0\n\n(49)\n\nwhich can be written as\n(\u22124p2 + \u03bbq \u2212 1)\u03c1W +\n\ni}\n\u03bb\u2202p \u03c1W + 4i}p\u2202q \u03c1W + }2 \u2202q2 \u03c1W = 0.\n2\n\n(50)\n\nIf we define a new variable z = 4p2 \u2212 \u03bbq + 1 the imaginary part of the former equation is\nidentically zero and for the real part we obtain a new form of the equation (50)\n}2 \u03bb2\n\nd2 \u03c1W\n\u2212 z\u03c1W = 0 ,\ndz 2\n\n(51)\n\nwhose solution is\n\u0013\n4p2 \u2212 \u03bbq + 1\n\u03c1W = c1 Ai\n.\n(52)\n(}\u03bb)2/3\nIn order to obtain the last result the formalism assumes the existence of the Wigner trans\u0012\n\nform, where the range of integration in this transform is from minus to plus infinity in\nthe variable q. However, the valid range interval for the variable q is positive but still the\nWigner function is very similar to (52) because of the exponential decay for positive values of the argument of Ai(x). Last equation indeed admits another solution corresponding\n\u0011\n\u0010 2\n4p \u2212\u03bbq+1\nto Bi (}\u03bb)2/3 , but in this case, the Airy function Bi(x) is divergent for positive x and\nthis part cannot be included as a suitable Wigner function. In fact, in order to obtain an\nappropriate solution from (47), the potential could be complemented by an infinite barrier\navoiding the existence of negatives values for q. However the implementation of this procedure is very cumbersome as it has been shown in [56] and [57] and it is not convenient to\ndevelop it here.\nInstead of this we can calculate the Wigner function using the following integral expression\n[36]\n\n\u221e\n\n\u001a\n\u001b \u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\nd\u03be\n\u03be\n\u03be\n\u03be\n\u2217\n\u03c1W (q, p) =\nexp \u2212 i p \u03a8 q \u2212\n\u03a8 q+\n.\n(53)\n}\n2\n2\n\u2212\u221e 2\u03c0}\nEmploying the convolution theorem and the Fourier transform of the Airy function we get\nZ\n\nthe Wigner function for the Hartle-Hawking wave function\n\u0014 2\n\u0015\n21/3\n4p \u2212 \u03bbq + 1\n\u03c1W (q, p) =\nAi\n.\n\u03c0(~\u03bb)1/3\n(~\u03bb)2/3\n\n(54)\n\nThe last result was obtained integrating out from minus to plus infinity in the variable q (in\nfact this result was already derived in [30]). However, the wave function is only valid defined\n14\n\n\fFIG. 1:\n\nThe Hartle-Hawking Wigner function (~ = \u03bb = 1).\n\nFIG. 2:\n\nHartle-Hawking Wigner function density projec-\n\nThe figure shows many oscillations due to the interference be-\n\ntion. It can be observed that the classical trajectory does not\n\ntween wave functions of expanding and contracting universes.\n\ncoincide with the highest peaks of the Wigner function.\n\nfor positive values of the scale factor and the q variable. Due to the fact that the Airy\nfunction Ai(x) presents an exponential decay for positive values of x, the Wigner function\nis very similar to the expression obtained in terms of the Airy function. If we restrict the\nrange of integration of q for positive values the computation for an analytical expression of\nthe Wigner function is very complicated. This problem is similar as the one we faced for\nthe Wheeler-DeWitt-Moyal equation. We cope with this complication by implementing a\nFortran code in order to calculate numerically the Wigner function. The result is given in\nFig. 1 and Fig. 2, where the continuous line corresponds to the classical trajectory (56) and\nthe dashed line to the trajectory (57).\nFor the Vilenkin wave function it is very difficult to get an analytical expression for\nthe Wigner function directly from (53) even using the WKB approximation for the wave\nfunction taking into account that the integration should be restricted for positive values of\nq. Again, we performed a numerical analysis to obtain the results that are depicted in Fig.\n3 and Fig. 4, where the meaning of the continuous and dashed lines are the same as in the\nHartle-Hawking case.\nAs before, the Linde Wigner function is very complicated to work with. We calculated\nthe Wigner function numerically and its behavior is presented in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6.\nThese plots can be described using the WKB approximation for the wave function and\n\n15\n\n\fFIG. 3:\n\nThe Vilenkin Wigner function.

By means of the stationary phase approximation, each\n\none of the former terms will contribute to the Wigner function in different regions bounded\nby the classical trajectory\n1\np2 = (\u03bbq \u2212 1),\n4\n\n(56)\n\n1\np2 = (\u03bbq \u2212 1),\n8\n\n(57)\n\nand by the trajectory\n\nwhich corresponds to points where the path integral has a saddle point at zero momentum\n[30], i.e. where the classical action changes sign. In the upper region of the phase space\nbetween the classical trajectory and the dashed curve the Wigner function has contributions\nmainly coming from the first term in the density matrix. The region inside the dashed curve\nreceives the principal contributions form the second and third terms of the density matrix.\nThe fourth term of the density matrix has a saddle point in the bottom part of phase space\nbetween the classical trajectory and the dashed curve and as a consequence it contributes\npredominantly in this region (see Fig. 2).\nThe Linde Wigner function has a similar structure like the Hartle-Hawking case but\nthere is one important difference: the interference terms between contracting and expanding\nuniverses have an opposite sign with respect to Hartle-Hawking. The consequence of this\ndifference is the reduction of the amplitudes of the oscillations inside the classical trajectory\n(see Fig. 5).\nThe Wigner function for the Vilenkin wave function only receives a contribution from\n\u2217\ndensity matrix corresponding to \u03c8\u2212 (q +\u03b1)\u03c8\u2212\n(q \u2212\u03b1) and it has a predominantly contribution\n\nonly in the lower region of phase space between the classical trajectory and the dashed line.\nThis behavior is reflected in Fig. 4. It is important to mention that decoherence of the\nVilenkin Wigner function appears to be easier taking into account that large amplitude\nterms due to interference between collapsing and expanding universes are not present near\np = 0.\nWe discuss now the interpretation of these numerical results. For the Hartle-Hawking\nWigner function we see an oscillatory behavior where the largest peaks are not on the\nclassical trajectory but away from it by a distance of O(~(2/3) ), we can appreciate this fact\nin the density plot. It should be remarked the existence of oscillations of the Wigner function\n\n17\n\n\fthat are not near of the classical trajectory, however the heights of these peaks decreases\nwith the distance to the classical trajectory.\nThe Wigner function for the Linde wave function present a similar pattern, in general\nterms, like the Hartle-Hawking wave function, however it is possible to see some differences.\nWe can appreciate more fluctuations of the Wigner function inside the region corresponding\nto the classical trajectory than the Hartle-Hawking Wigner function. Furthermore, the\namplitude of the oscillations are smaller for the Linde wave function than for Hartle-Hawking.\nThe largest peaks of the Wigner function correspond to the classical trajectory.\nIn the case of the Wigner function for the Vilenkin wave function the classical trajectory\nis at some parts of the curve at the middle of the largest peaks of the Wigner function, i.e.\nthe Vilenkin Wigner function has the largest peaks more closely to the classical trajectory\nthan the Hartle-Hawking Wigner function, but only in one part. This behavior is expected,\nas we explained above, due to the fact that the Vilenkin wave function represents the tunneling wave function and as a consequence there is only one part of the classical trajectory\ncorresponding to negative values of the momenta (expanding universe).\n\nB.\n\nKantowski-Sachs model\n\nAnother interesting case to deal with under the deformation quantization procedure is\nthe cosmological Kantowski-Sachs model (KS) [58].

For values of \u03bd bigger than one the Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 show an increment\nin the number of oscillations of Wigner function and the peaks of the oscillations are far\naway from the classical trajectory.

Of course further generalizations can be implemented in the general case with [\u03a0Z\u03b1 , \u03a0Z\u03b2 ] 6= 0.\nThe noncommutative Wheeler-DeWitt equation is written as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u22022\n\u22022\n\u2212 2+\n+ 48 exp(\u22122 3\u03a9 + 3 \u03b8P\u03b2 ) \u03a8(\u03a9, \u03b2) = 0,\n\u2202\u03a9\n\u2202\u03b2 2\n21\n\n(76)\n\n\fFIG. 9:\n\nThe Wigner function for the Kantowski-Sachs wave\n\nFIG. 10:\n\nDensity projection of the Kantowski-Sachs\n\nfunction for \u03bd = 1.

Here we will have a\nsystem with two coordinates of the flat minisuperspace (2 degrees of freedom).\nWe are going to consider a baby universe with conformal matter \u03c60 and a three-metric\nhij defined on a Cauchy hypersurface S of a closed wormhole universe. The matter is\n27\n\n\frepresented by a conformal invariant scalar field expanded in hyper-spherical harmonics Qn\nP\nof the surface S given by \u03c60 = a1 n fn Qn , where a is the scale factor and fn are orthonormal\nmodes. The metric on S is given by hij = a2 * (\u03a9ij + \u03b5ij ). Here \u03a9ij is the metric of a unit\n\u0001\nP\nthree-sphere S3 and \u03b5ij = n an \u03a9ij Qn + bn Pijn + cn Sijn + dn Gijn . The Qn 's are the scalar\nharmonics of the 3-sphere, Pijn is a suitable combination of Qn , Sijn is defined in terms of\nthe transverse vector harmonics and Gijn are the transverse traceless tensor harmonics on\nS.\nOn the gravitational part, in a suitable gauge (an = bn = cn = 0) of hij on S and\nconsidering the case without gravitons (dn = 0), one can express the three metric simply as:\nhij = a2 * \u03a9ij . Thus, the wave function \u03a8 is a function of the scale factor a and the harmonic\nmodes of the scalar field fn . This wave function fulfills the Wheeler-DeWitt equation (10)\nof the form\n\u0014X\u0012\nn\n\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u22022\n\u22022\n2 2\n2\n\u03a8(a, fn ) = 0,\n\u2212 2 + n fn \u2212 \u2212 2 + a\n\u2202fn\n\u2202a\n\n(100)\n\nwhere we have implemented the canonical relation on the momenta pbfn = \u2212i~ \u2202f\u2202n and\n\u2202\npba = \u2212i~ \u2202a\n.\n\nIn the context of quantum cosmology the solution factorizes in a purely gravitational\npart and an purely matter part. Both of them correspond to harmonic oscillators and the\nsolution is given by\n\u0012 2\u0013 Y\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221a\na\nnfn2\n\u03a8(a, fn ) = AHm (a) exp \u2212\n*\nHmn (fn n) exp \u2212\n,\n2\n2\nn\n\n(101)\n\nwhere Hm (x) are the Hermite polynomials and A is a normalization constant. This solution\nsatisfies the boundary conditions such that: \u03c8(a, fn ) \u2192 0 as a \u2192 \u221e and it is regular at\na = 0.\nHere it is assumed, as in [70], that the zero-point energy of the gravitational sector\nwill precisely compensates the zero-point energy of the matter oscillators as it happens in a\nsupersymmetric theory. This solution represents a closed universe carrying m scalar particles\nin the n-th mode. Thus the ground state |\u03a80 i will correspond to m = 0 and n = 0, i.e., the\nabsence of matter particles and consequently excited states of the scale factor part.\nQ\nThe wave function factorization \u03a8(a, fn ) = \u03c80 (a)* n \u03c8n (fn ) comes from the inner product\nbetween ha, fn | and |\u03c80 , \u03c8n i.

The WWGM correspondence is explicitly developed and the Stratonovich-Weyl\nquantizer, the star product and the Wigner functional are obtained. These results can be\nused in general situations but in a first approach we applied the formalism to some interesting\nminisuperspace models widely studied in the literature, in particular, we used the Moyal star\nproduct to describe some relevant cosmological models in phase space.\nWe studied de Sitter quantum cosmology using the Hartle-Hawking, Vilenkin and Linde\nboundary conditions, where we have found numerically the Wigner function for all of these\ncases.\n30\n\n\fFor the Hartle-Hawking wave function the behavior of the Wigner function presents\nmany oscillations due to interference terms between the wave functions of expanding and\ncontracting universes. Similarly as in Ref. [30] our result shows that the highest peaks of\nthe Wigner function do not coincide with the classical trajectory of the universe.\nThe Linde Wigner function has a similar behavior to the Hartle-Hawking case, where there\nare also expanding and contracting components of the wave function. The main difference\nin their corresponding Wigner functions is just a sign in the interference terms between the\nexpanding and contracting wave functions and as a consequence it produces a reduction in\nthe amplitude of the oscillations inside the classical region.\nIn the case of the Vilenkin tunneling wave function we notice that the Wigner function\nhas less oscillations compared to the Hartle-Hawking Wigner function. This is explained by\nthe fact that there are less oscillation effects because there is only an outgoing wave. In this\ncase the classical trajectory corresponds almost to the maxima of the peaks of the Wigner\nfunction.\nHowever the classical limit for these three models is difficult to obtain due to the existence\nof oscillations in the Wigner functions. It is important to note that decoherence of the\nVilenkin Wigner function is in principle simpler to obtain since the interference terms are\nabsent because there is only an expanding universe around p = 0.\nFor the Kantowski-Sachs cosmological model we found the Wheeler-DeWitt-Moyal equation which is equivalent to a differential-difference equation. We found its exact solution in\nterms of the Meijer's function. We observe that the classical trajectory corresponds to the\nhighest peaks of the Wigner function for values close to \u03bd = 1. The situation for \u03bd \u2264 1 in the\nWigner function corresponds to have less oscillations and the classical trajectory does not\ncorrespond to the highest peaks. For values of \u03bd \u2265 1 we have an increment in the number\nof oscillations of the Wigner function and we do not have the peaks of the oscillations near\nthe classical trajectory. Thus it seems that \u03bd could be regarded as a parameter encoding\nthe quantum interference effects.\nWe have also considered the noncommutative Kantowski-Sachs model. In a similar way\nwe obtain the analytic Wigner function and its differential-difference equation. This case\npresents a noncommutative parameter \u03b8 deforming the Wheeler-DeWitt-Moyal equation.\nThe Wigner function is determined in terms of the above Meijer's function with shifted argument by a factor proportional to \u03b8. We have constructed numerically the Wigner function\n31\n\n\fwith wave packet weighted by a Gaussian to see the effects of the noncommutativity. There\nwere found several peaks in the Wigner function around the Gaussian which can be interpreted as different universes connected by tunneling. Thus, at the semi-classical level, the\nstatement made in [21] about that the noncommutativity of the minisuperspace produces\nnew possible states of the universe at early stages is confirmed.\nString cosmology with dilaton exponential potential is also discussed. We found the corresponding Wheeler-DeWitt-Moyal equation and the equivalent differential-difference equation. These equations have an exact solution in terms of the hypergeometric and Meijer's\nfunctions.\nBaby universe solutions are also obtained in this context where the Wigner function is\ncalculated by finding the exact solution of its Wheeler-DeWitt-Moyal equation consisting in\ntwo decoupled deformed harmonic oscillators in terms of Laguerre polynomials.\nIt is important to remark that this work opens the possibility of treating several important questions that remain unsolved in quantum cosmology with a novel approach. For\ninstance, deformation quantization allows to deal with systems having phase spaces with\nnontrivial topology. In quantum cosmology, the existence of symmetries implies that the\nphase-superspace and in particular, the phase-minisuperspace will be reduced by the implementation of these symmetries leading to a non-trivial topological space with a non-flat\nmetric. Therefore, deformation quantization is able to treat these mentioned cases in a natural way. Moreover the extension to supersymmetric quantum cosmology [17, 19, 20] can\nbe also treated applying the results of [72].\nAnother point to remark is that the Wheeler-DeWitt-Moyal equation (29) proposed in\nthe present paper contains the generalized mass-shell equation and the Wheeler-DeWittVlasov transport equation in the flat minisuperspace [29] encoded in its real an imaginary\nparts respectively. The former result was obtained using the Moyal ?\u2212product and then all\nthe technics of deformation quantization developed for a long time can be apply to it. It\nis known that the mass-shell equation and the Wheeler-DeWitt-Vlasov transport equation\nadmits a suitable generalization to curved minisuperspace [29]. It would be interesting to\ndeal with curved symplectic cases where the Fedosov's approach could be applied in order\nto find the Wheeler-DeWitt-Moyal equation in non-trivial phase superspaces and obtain\nthe mass-shell and the Wheeler-DeWitt-Vlasov equations. We will study this problem in a\nfurther communication.\n32\n\n\fBesides, as was mentioned before, the problem of obtaining the classical limit by implementing a coarse graining is relevant. It is possible to model a coarse graining through the\nLiouville equation with friction and diffusion terms [30], this approach can be addressed in\nthe context of the deformation quantization formalism.\nTo conclude, we consider that deformation quantization possesses various advantages\nin order to deal with more complicated problems in quantum cosmology for example, to\ntreat systems with non trivial topology or with curved minisuperspaces. For these cases\nthe canonical quantization could lead to the existence of nonhermitian operators which is\navoided in deformation quantization as a result of the use of classical objects instead of\noperators. For these reasons more examples and further research is needed to develop this\napproximation.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe work of R. C., H. G.-C. and F. J.
