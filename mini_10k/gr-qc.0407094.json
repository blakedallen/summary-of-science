The ultimate reason for this is that\nglobally hyperbolic spacetimes belong to a category that is equivalent\nto a special category of domains called interval domains.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn [2], we proved that a globally hyperbolic spacetime with its causality\nrelation is a bicontinuous poset whose interval topology is the topology of\nspacetime. In this paper, we will see how this directly implies that a globally hyperbolic spacetime can be reconstructed in a purely order theoretic\nmanner, beginning from only a countable dense set of events and the causality relation. The ultimately reason for this is that the category of globally hyperbolic posets, which contains the globally hyperbolic spacetimes, is\nequivalent to a very special category of domains called interval domains.\n1\n\n\fDomains were discovered in computer science by Scott [8] for the purpose of providing a semantics for the lambda calculus. They are partially\nordered sets which carry intrinsic (order theoretic) notions of completeness\nand approximation. From a certain viewpoint, then, the fact that the category of globally hyperbolic posets is equivalent to the category of interval\ndomains is surprising, since globally hyperbolic spacetimes are usually not\norder theoretically complete. This equivalence also explains why spacetime\ncan be reconstructed order theoretically from a countable dense set: each \u03c9continuous domain is the ideal completion of a countable abstract basis, i.e.,\nthe interval domains associated to globally hyperbolic spacetimes are the\nsystematic 'limits' of discrete sets. This may be relevant to the development\nof a foundation for quantum gravity, an idea we discuss at the end.\n\n2\n\nDomains, continuous posets and topology\n\nA poset is a partially ordered set, i.e., a set together with a reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive relation.\nDefinition 2.1 Let (P, \u2291) be a partially ordered set. A nonempty subset\nS \u2286 P is directed if (\u2200x, y \u2208 S)(\u2203z \u2208 S) x, y \u2291 z. The supremum of SF\u2286 P\nis the least of all its upper bounds provided it exists. This is written S.\nThese ideas have duals that will be important to us: AVnonempty S \u2286 P is\nfiltered if (\u2200x, y \u2208 S)(\u2203z \u2208 S) z \u2291 x, y. The infimum S of S \u2286 P is the\ngreatest of all its lower bounds provided it exists.\nDefinition 2.2 For a subset X of a poset P , set\n\u2191X := {y \u2208 P : (\u2203x \u2208 X) x \u2291 y} & \u2193X := {y \u2208 P : (\u2203x \u2208 X) y \u2291 x}.\nWe write \u2191 x = \u2191 {x} and \u2193 x = \u2193 {x} for elements x \u2208 X.\nA partial order allows for the derivation of several intrinsically defined\ntopologies. Here is our first example.\nDefinition 2.3 A subset U of a poset P is Scott open if\n(i) U is an upper set: x \u2208 U & x \u2291 y \u21d2 y \u2208 U , and\n(ii) U is inaccessible by directed suprema: For every directed S \u2286 P with\na supremum,\nG\nS \u2208 U \u21d2 S \u2229 U 6= \u2205.\n2\n\n\fThe collection of all Scott open sets on P is called the Scott topology.\nDefinition 2.4 A dcpo is a poset in which every directed subset has a\nsupremum. The least element in a poset, when it exists, is the unique\nelement \u22a5 with \u22a5 \u2291 x for all x.\nThe set of maximal elements in a dcpo D is\nmax(D) := {x \u2208 D : \u2191x = {x}}.\nEach element in a dcpo has a maximal element above it.\nDefinition 2.5 For elements x, y of a poset, write x \u226a y iff for all directed\nsets S with a supremum,\nG\ny\u2291\nS \u21d2 (\u2203s \u2208 S) x \u2291 s.\nWe set \u2193x = {a \u2208 D : a \u226a x} and \u2191x = {a \u2208 D : x \u226a a}.\nFor the symbol \"\u226a,\" read \"approximates.\"\nDefinition 2.6 A basis for a poset D is a subset B such that B\u2229 \u2193x contains\na directed set with supremum x for all x \u2208 D. A poset is continuous if it\nhas a basis. A poset is \u03c9-continuous if it has a countable basis.\nContinuous posets have an important property, they are interpolative.\nProposition 2.7 If x \u226a y in a continuous poset P , then there is z \u2208 P\nwith x \u226a z \u226a y.\nThis enables a clear description of the Scott topology,\nTheorem 2.8 The collection {\u2191x : x \u2208 D} is a basis for the Scott topology\non a continuous poset.\nAnd also helps us give a clear definition of the Lawson topology.\nDefinition 2.9 The Lawson topology on a continuous poset P has as a basis\nall sets of the form \u2191x\\\u2191F , for F \u2286 P finite.\nThe next idea is fundamental to the present work:\n\n3\n\n\fDefinition 2.10 A continuous poset P is bicontinuous if\n\u2022 For all x, y \u2208 P , x \u226a y iff for all filtered S \u2286 P with an infimum,\n^\nS \u2291 x \u21d2 (\u2203s \u2208 S) s \u2291 y,\nand\n\n\u2022 For each x \u2208 P , the set \u2191x is filtered with infimum x.\nExample 2.11 R, Q are bicontinuous.\nDefinition 2.12 On a bicontinuous poset P , sets of the form\n(a, b) := {x \u2208 P : a \u226a x \u226a b}\nform a basis for a topology called the interval topology.\nThe proof uses interpolation and bicontinuity. A bicontinuous poset P has\n\u2191x 6= \u2205 for each x, so it is rarely a dcpo. Later we will see that on a bicontinuous poset, the Lawson topology is contained in the interval topology\n(causal simplicity), the interval topology is Hausdorff (strong causality), and\n\u2264 is a closed subset of P 2 .\nDefinition 2.13 A continuous dcpo is a continuous poset which is also a\ndcpo. A domain is a continuous dcpo.\nExample 2.14 Let X be a locally compact Hausdorff space. Its upper space\nUX = {\u2205 =\n6 K \u2286 X : K is compact}\nordered under reverse inclusion\nA\u2291B\u21d4B\u2286A\nis a continuous dcpo:\n\u2022 For directed S \u2286 UX ,\n\nF\n\nS=\n\nT\n\nS.\n\n\u2022 For all K, L \u2208 UX , K \u226a L \u21d4 L \u2286 int(K).\n\u2022 UX is \u03c9-continuous iff X has a countable basis.\n\n4\n\n\fIt is interesting here that the space X can be recovered from UX in a purely\norder theoretic manner:\nX \u2243 max(UX ) = {{x} : x \u2208 X}\nwhere max(UX ) carries the relative Scott topology it inherits as a subset\nof UX . Several constructions of this type are known.\nThe next example is due to Scott[8]; it will be good to keep in mind when\nstudying the analogous construction for globally hyperbolic spacetimes.\nExample 2.15 The collection of compact intervals of the real line\nIR = {[a, b] : a, b \u2208 R & a \u2264 b}\nordered under reverse inclusion\n[a, b] \u2291 [c, d] \u21d4 [c, d] \u2286 [a, b]\nis an \u03c9-continuous dcpo:\n\u2022 For directed S \u2286 IR,\n\nF\n\nS=\n\n\u2022 I \u226a J \u21d4 J \u2286 int(I), and\n\nT\n\nS,\n\n\u2022 {[p, q] : p, q \u2208 Q & p \u2264 q} is a countable basis for IR.\nThe domain IR is called the interval domain.\nWe also have max(IR) \u2243 R in the Scott topology. Approximation can help\nexplain why:\nExample 2.16 A basic Scott open set in IR is\n\u2191[a, b] = {x \u2208 IR : x \u2286 (a, b)}.\nWe have not considered algebraic domains here, though should point out to\nthe reader that algebraic models of globally hyperbolic spacetime are easy\nto construct.\n\n5\n\n\f3\n\nThe causal structure of spacetime\n\nA manifold M is a locally Euclidean Hausdorff space that is connected and\nhas a countable basis. A connected Hausdorff manifold is paracompact iff\nit has a countable basis. A Lorentz metric on a manifold is a symmetric,\nnondegenerate tensor field of type (0, 2) whose signature is (\u2212 + ++).\nDefinition 3.1 A spacetime is a real four-dimensional smooth manifold M\nwith a Lorentz metric gab .\nLet (M, gab ) be a time orientable spacetime. Let \u03a0+\n\u2264 denote the future\n+\ndirected causal curves, and \u03a0< denote the future directed time-like curves.\nDefinition 3.2 For p \u2208 M,\nI + (p) := {q \u2208 M : (\u2203\u03c0 \u2208 \u03a0+\n< ) \u03c0(0) = p, \u03c0(1) = q}\nand\nJ + (p) := {q \u2208 M : (\u2203\u03c0 \u2208 \u03a0+\n\u2264 ) \u03c0(0) = p, \u03c0(1) = q}\nSimilarly, we define I \u2212 (p) and J \u2212 (p).\nWe write the relation J + as\np \u2291 q \u2261 q \u2208 J + (p).\nWe always assume the chronology conditions that ensure (M, \u2291) is a partially ordered set. We also assume strong causality which can be characterized as follows [7]:\nTheorem 3.3 A spacetime M is strongly causal iff its Alexandroff topology\nis Hausdorff iff its Alexandroff topology is the manifold topology.\nThe Alexandroff topology on a spacetime has {I + (p) \u2229 I \u2212 (q) : p, q \u2208 M}\nas a basis [7]. Penrose has called globally hyperbolic spacetimes \"the physically reasonable spacetimes [9].\"\nDefinition 3.4 A spacetime M is globally hyperbolic if it is strongly causal\nand if \u2191a \u2229 \u2193b is compact in the manifold topology, for all a, b \u2208 M.\nThe following is the main result of [2]:\nTheorem 3.5 If M is globally hyperbolic, then (M, \u2291) is a bicontinuous\nposet with \u226a = I + whose interval topology is the manifold topology.\n6\n\n\f4\n\nGlobal hyperbolicity in the abstract\n\nThere are two elements which make the topology of a globally hyperbolic\nspacetime tick. They are:\n(i) A bicontinuous poset (X, \u2264).\n(ii) The intervals [a, b] = {x : a \u2264 x \u2264 b} are compact in the interval\ntopology on X.\nFrom these two we can deduce some aspects we already know as well as some\nnew ones. In particular, bicontinuity ensures that the topology of X, the\ninterval topology, is implicit in \u2264. We call such posets globally hyperbolic.\nTheorem 4.1 A globally hyperbolic poset is locally compact Hausdorff.\n(i) The Lawson topology is contained in the interval topology.\n(ii) Its partial order \u2264 is a closed subset of X 2 .\n(iii) Each directed set with an upper bound has a supremum.\n(iv) Each filtered set with a lower bound has a infimum.\nProof. First we show that the Lawson topology is contained in the interval\ntopology. Sets of the form \u2191x are open in the interval topology. To prove\nX\\\u2191 x is open, let y \u2208 X\\\u2191 x. Then x 6\u2291 y. By bicontinuity, there is b with\ny \u226a b such that x 6\u2291 b. For any a \u226a y,\ny \u2208 (a, b) \u2286 X\\\u2191 x\nwhich proves the Lawson topology is contained in the interval topology.\nBecause the Lawson topology is always Hausdorff on a continuous poset, X\nis Hausdorff in its interval topology.\nLet x \u2208 U where U is open. Then there is an open interval x \u2208 (a, b) \u2286 U .\nBy continuity of (X, \u2264), we can interpolate twice, obtaining a closed interval\n[c, d] followed by another open interval we call V . We get\nx \u2208 V \u2286 [c, d] \u2286 (a, b) \u2286 U.\nThe closure of V is contained in [c, d]: X is Hausdorff so compact sets like\n[c, d] are closed. Then Cl(V ) is a closed subset of a compact space [c, d], so\nit must be compact. This proves X is locally compact.\n7\n\n\fTo prove \u2264 is a closed subset of X 2 , let (a, b) \u2208 X 2 \\ \u2264. Since a 6\u2264 b, there\nis x \u226a a with x 6\u2264 b by continuity. Since x 6\u2264 b, there is y with b \u226a y and\nx 6\u2264 y by bicontinuity. Now choose elements 1 and 2 such that x \u226a a \u226a 1\nand 2 \u226a b \u226a y. Then\n(a, b) \u2208 (x, 1) \u00d7 (2, y) \u2286 X 2 \\ \u2264 .\nFor if (c, d) \u2208 (x, 1) \u00d7 (2, y) and c \u2264 d, then x \u2264 c \u2264 1 and 2 \u2264 d \u2264 y, and\nsince c \u2264 d, we get x \u2264 y, a contradiction. This proves X 2 \\ \u2264 is open.\nGiven a directed set S \u2286 X with an upper bound x, if we fix any element\n1 \u2208 S, then the set \u21911 \u2229 S is also directed and has a supremum iff S does.\nThen we can assume that S has a least element named 1 \u2208 S. The inclusion\nf : S \u2192 X :: s 7\u2192 s is a net and since S is contained in the compact set\n[1, x], f has a convergent subnet\ng : I \u2192 S. Then T := g(I) \u2286 S is directed\nF\nand cofinal in S. We claim T = lim T .\nFirst, lim T is an upper bound for T . If there were t \u2208 T with t 6\u2291 lim T ,\nthen lim T \u2208 X\\ \u2191 t. Since X\\ \u2191 t is open, there is \u03b1 \u2208 I such that\n(\u2200\u03b2 \u2208 I)\u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2 \u21d2 g(\u03b2) \u2208 X\\ \u2191 t.\nLet u = g(\u03b1) and t = g(\u03b3). Since I is directed, there is \u03b2 \u2208 I with \u03b1, \u03b3 \u2264 \u03b2.\nThen\ng(\u03b2) \u2208 X\\\u2191 t & t = g(\u03b3) \u2264 g(\u03b2)\nwhere the second inequality follows from the fact that subnets are monotone\nby definition.FThis is a contradiction, which proves t \u2291 lim T for all t.\nTo prove T = lim T , let u be an upper bound for T . Then t \u2291 u for\nall t. However, if lim T 6\u2264 u, then lim T \u2208 X\\ \u2193 u, and since X\\ \u2193 u is open,\nwe get that T \u2229 (X\\ \u2193 u) 6= \u2205, which contradicts that u is an upper bound\nfor T . (Equivalently,\nF we could have just used the fact that \u2264 is closed.)\nNow we prove S = lim T . Let s \u2208 S. Since T is cofinal in S, there is\nt \u2208 T with s \u2264 t. Hence s \u2264 t \u2264 lim T , so lim T is an upper bound for S. To\nfinish, any upper bound for S is one for T so it must be above lim T . Then\nF\nS = lim T .\nGiven a filtered set S with a lower bound x, we can assume it has a\ngreatest element 1. The map f : S \u2217 \u2192 S :: x 7\u2192 x is a net where the poset\nS \u2217 is obtained by reversing the order on S. Since S \u2286 [x, 1], f has a convergent subnet g, and now the proof is simply the dual of the suprema case. \u2737\nGlobally hyperbolic posets share a remarkable property with metric\nspaces, that separability and second countability are equivalent.\n8\n\n\fProposition 4.2 Let (X, \u2264) be a bicontinuous poset. If C \u2286 X is a countable dense subset in the interval topology, then\n(i) The collection\n{(ai , bi ) : ai , bi \u2208 C, ai \u226a bi }\nis a countable basis for the interval topology. Thus, separability implies\nsecond countability, and even complete metrizability if X is globally\nhyperbolic.\n(ii) For all x \u2208 X, \u2193x \u2229 C contains a directed set with supremum x, and\n\u2191x \u2229 C contains a filtered set with infimum x.\nProof. (i) Sets of the form (a, b) := {x \u2208 X : a \u226a x \u226a b} form a basis\nfor the interval topology. If x \u2208 (a, b), then since C is dense, there is\nai \u2208 (a, x) \u2229 C and bi \u2208 (x, b) \u2229 C and so x \u2208 (ai , bi ) \u2286 (a, b).\n(ii) Fix x \u2208 X. Given any a \u226a x, the set (a, x) is open and C is dense,\nso there is ca \u2208 C with a \u226a ca \u226a x. The set S = {ca \u2208 C : a \u226a x} \u2286 \u2193x \u2229 C\nis directed: If ca , cb \u2208 S, then since \u2193x is directed, Fthere is d \u226a x with\nca , cd \u2291 d \u226a x and thus ca , cb \u2291 cd \u2208 S. Finally, S = x: Any upper\nbound for S is also one for \u2193x and so above x by continuity. The dual argument shows \u2191x \u2229 C contains a filtered set with inf x. \u2737\nGlobally hyperbolic posets are very much like the real line. In fact, a\nwell-known domain theoretic construction pertaining to the real line extends\nin perfect form to the globally hyperbolic posets:\nTheorem 4.3 The closed intervals of a globally hyperbolic poset X\nIX := {[a, b] : a \u2264 b & a, b \u2208 X}\nordered by reverse inclusion\n[a, b] \u2291 [c, d] \u2261 [c, d] \u2286 [a, b]\nform a continuous domain with\n[a, b] \u226a [c, d] \u2261 a \u226a c & d \u226a b.\nThe poset X has a countable basis iff IX is \u03c9-continuous. Finally,\nmax(IX) \u2243 X\nwhere the set of maximal elements has the relative Scott topology from IX.\n9\n\n\fProof. If S \u2286 IX is a directed set, we can write it as\nS = {[ai , bi ] : i \u2208 I}.\nWithout loss of generality, we can assume S has a least element 1 = [a, b].\nThus, for all i \u2208 I, a \u2264 ai \u2264 bi \u2264 b. Then {ai } is a directed subset of X\nbounded above\nF by b, {bi }Vis a filtered subset of X bounded below by a. We\nknow that ai = lim ai , bi = lim bi and that \u2264 is closed. It follows that\nhG ^ i\nG\nai , bi .\nS=\n\nFor the continuity of IX, consider [a, b] \u2208 IX. If c \u226a a and b \u226a d, then\n[c, d] \u226a [a, b] in IX. Then\nG\n[a, b] = {[c, d] : c \u226a a & b \u226a d}\n(1)\n\na supremum that is directed since X is bicontinuous. Suppose now that\n[x, y] \u226a [a, b] in IX. Then using (1), there is [c, d] with [x, y] \u2291 [c, d] such\nthat c \u226a a and b \u226a d which means x \u2291 c \u226a a and b \u226a d \u2291 y and thus\nx \u226a a and b \u226a y. This completely characterizes the \u226a relation on IX,\nwhich now enables us to prove max(IX) \u2243 X, since we can write\n\u2191[a, b] \u2229 max(IX) = {{x} : x \u2208 X & a \u226a x \u226a b}\nand \u2191[a, b] is a basis for the Scott topology on IX.\nFinally, if X has a countable basis, then it has a countable dense subset\nC \u2286 X, which means {[an , bn ] : an \u226a bn , an , bn \u2208 C} is a countable basis for\nIX by Prop. 4.2(ii). \u2737\nThe endpoints of an interval [a, b] form a two element list x : {1, 2} \u2192 X\nwith a = x(1) \u2264 x(2) = b. We call these formal intervals. They determine\nthe information in an interval as follows:\nCorollary 4.4 The formal intervals ordered by\nx \u2291 y \u2261 x(1) \u2264 y(1) & y(2) \u2264 x(2)\nform a domain isomorphic to IX.\nThis observation \u2013 that spacetime has a canonical domain theoretic\nmodel \u2013 has at least two important applications, one of which we now consider. We prove that from only a countable set of events and the causality\nrelation, one can reconstruct spacetime in a purely order theoretic manner.\nExplaining this requires domain theory.\n10\n\n\f5\n\nSpacetime from discrete causality\n\nRecall from the appendix on domain theory that an abstract basis is a set\n(C, \u226a) with a transitive relation that is interpolative from the \u2212 direction:\nF \u226a x \u21d2 (\u2203y \u2208 C) F \u226a y \u226a x,\nfor all finite subsets F \u2286 C and all x \u2208 F . Suppose, though, that it is also\ninterpolative from the + direction:\nx \u226a F \u21d2 (\u2203y \u2208 C) x \u226a y \u226a F.\nThen we can define a new abstract basis of intervals\nint(C) = {(a, b) : a \u226a b} = \u226a \u2286 C 2\nwhose relation is\n(a, b) \u226a (c, d) \u2261 a \u226a c & d \u226a b.\n\nLemma 5.1 If (C, \u226a) is an abstract basis that is \u00b1 interpolative, then\n(int(C), \u226a) is an abstract basis.\nProof. Let F = {(ai , bi ) : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n} \u226a (a, b). Let A = {ai } and B = {bi }.\nThen A \u226a a and b \u226a B in C. Since C lets us interpolate in both directions,\nwe get (x, y) with F \u226a (x, y) \u226a (a, b). Transitivity is inherited from C. \u2737\nLet IC denote the ideal completion of the abstract basis int(C).\nTheorem 5.2 Let C be a countable dense subset of a globally hyperbolic\nspacetime M and \u226a = I + be timelike causality. Then\nmax(IC) \u2243 M\nwhere the set of maximal elements have the Scott topology.\nProof. Because M is bicontinuous, the sets \u2191x and \u2193x are filtered and directed respectively. Thus (C, \u226a) is an abstract basis for which (int(C), \u226a)\nis also an abstract basis. Because C is dense, (int(C), \u226a) is a basis for\nthe domain IM. But, the ideal completion of any basis for IM must be\nisomorphic to IM. Thus, IC \u2243 IM, and so M \u2243 max(IM) \u2243 max(IC). \u2737\n\n11\n\n\fIn \"ordering the order\" I + , taking its completion, and then the set of\nmaximal elements, we recover spacetime by reasoning only about the causal\nrelationships between a countable dense set of events. We should say a bit\nmore too.\nTheorem 5.2 is very different from results like \"Let M be a certain spacetime with relation \u2264. Then the interval topology is the manifold topology.\"\nHere we identify, in abstract terms, a beautiful process by which a countable\nset with a causality relation determines a space. The process is entirely order theoretic in nature, spacetime is not required to understand or execute it\n(i.e., if we put C = Q and \u226a=<, then max(IC) \u2243 R). In this sense, our understanding of the relation between causality and the topology of spacetime\nis now explainable independently of geometry.\nLast, notice that if we naively try to obtain M by taking the ideal\ncompletion of (S, \u2291) or (S, \u226a) that it will not work: M is not a dcpo. Some\nother process is necessary, and the exact structure of globally hyperbolic\nspacetime allows one to carry out this alternative process. Ideally, one would\nnow like to know what constraints on C in general imply that max(IC) is a\nmanifold.\n\n6\n\nSpacetime as a domain\n\nThe category of globally hyperbolic posets is naturally isomorphic to a special category of domains called interval domains.\nDefinition 6.1 An interval poset is a poset D that has two functions left : D \u2192 max(D)\nand right : D \u2192 max(D) such that\n(i) Each x \u2208 D is an \"interval\" with left(x) and right(x) as endpoints:\n(\u2200x \u2208 D) x = left(x) \u2293 right(x),\n(ii) The union of two intervals with a common endpoint is another interval:\nFor all x, y \u2208 D, if right(x) = left(y), then\nleft(x \u2293 y) = left(x) & right(x \u2293 y) = right(y),\n(iii) Each point p \u2208 \u2191x \u2229 max(D) of an interval x \u2208 D determines two\nsubintervals, left(x) \u2293 p and p \u2293 right(x), with endpoints:\nleft(left(x) \u2293 p) = left(x)\n\n&\n\nright(left(x) \u2293 p) = p\n\nleft(p \u2293 right(x)) = p\n\n&\n\nright(p \u2293 right(x)) = right(x)\n\n12\n\n\fNotice that a nonempty interval poset D has max(D) 6= \u2205 by definition.\nWith interval posets, we only assume that infima indicated in the definition\nexist; in particular, we do not assume the existence of all binary infima.\nDefinition 6.2 For an interval poset (D, left, right), the relation \u2264 on max(D)\nis\na \u2264 b \u2261 (\u2203 x \u2208 D) a = left(x) & b = right(x)\nfor a, b \u2208 max(D).\nLemma 6.3 (max(D), \u2264) is a poset.\nProof. Reflexivity: By property (i) of an interval poset, x \u2291 left(x), right(x),\nso if a \u2208 max(D), a = left(a) = right(a), which means a \u2264 a. Antisymmetry: If a \u2264 b and b \u2264 a, then there are x, y \u2208 D with a = left(x) = right(y)\nand b = right(x) = left(y), so this combined with property (i) gives\nx = left(x) \u2293 right(x) = right(y) \u2293 left(y) = y\nand thus a = b. Transitivity: If a \u2264 b and b \u2264 c, then there are x, y \u2208 D\nwith a = left(x), b = right(x) = left(y) and c = right(y), so property (ii) of\ninterval posets says that for z = x \u2293 y we have\nleft(z) = left(x) = a & right(z) = right(y) = c\nand thus a \u2264 c.\n\n\u2737\n\nAn interval poset D is the set of intervals of (max(D), \u2264) ordered by\nreverse inclusion:\nLemma 6.4 If D is an interval poset, then\nx \u2291 y \u2261 (left(x) \u2264 left(y) \u2264 right(y) \u2264 right(x))\nProof (\u21d2) Since x \u2291 y \u2291 left(y), property (iii) of interval posets implies\nz = left(x) \u2293 left(y) is an \"interval\" with\nleft(z) = left(x) & right(z) = left(y)\nand thus left(x) \u2264 left(y). The inequality right(y) \u2264 right(x) follows similarly. The inequality left(y) \u2264 right(y) follows from the definition of \u2264.\n(\u21d0) Applying the definition of \u2264 and properties (ii) and (i) of interval\nposets to left(x) \u2264 left(y) \u2264 right(x), we get x \u2291 left(y). Similarly, x \u2291\nright(y). Then x \u2291 left(y) \u2293 right(y) = y. \u2737\n13\n\n\fCorollary 6.5 If D is an interval poset,\n\u03c6 : D \u2192 I(max(D), \u2264) :: x 7\u2192 [left(x), right(x)]\nis an order isomorphism.\nIn particular,\np \u2208 \u2191x \u2229 max(D) \u2261 left(x) \u2264 p \u2264 right(x)\nin any interval poset.\nDefinition 6.6 If (D, left, right) is an interval poset,\n[p, *] := left\u22121 (p) and [*, q] := right\u22121 (q)\nfor any p, q \u2208 max(D).\nDefinition 6.7 An interval domain is an interval poset (D, left, right) where\nD is a continuous dcpo such that\n(i) If p \u2208 \u2191x \u2229 max(D), then\n\u2191(left(x) \u2293 p) 6= \u2205\n\n&\n\n\u2191(p \u2293 right(x)) 6= \u2205.\n\n(ii) For all x \u2208 D, the following are equivalent:\n(a) \u2191x =\n6 \u2205\n(b) (\u2200y \u2208 [ left(x), * ] )( y \u2291 x \u21d2 y \u226a right(y) in [ *, right(y) ] )\n(c) (\u2200y \u2208 [*, right(x)])( y \u2291 x \u21d2 y \u226a left(y) in [ left(y), * ] )\n(iii) Invariance of endpoints under suprema:\n(a) For all directed S \u2286 [p, *]\nG\nleft( S) = p &\n\nG\nG\nright( S) = right( T )\n\nfor any directed T \u2286 [q, *] with right(T ) = right(S).\n\n(b) For all directed S \u2286 [*, q]\nG\nG\nleft( S) = left( T ) &\n\nG\nright( S) = q\n\nfor any directed T \u2286 [*, p] with left(T ) = left(S).\n14\n\n\f(iv) Intervals are compact: For all x \u2208 D, \u2191 x \u2229 max(D) is Scott compact.\nInterval domains are interval posets whose axioms also take into account\nthe completeness and approximation present in a domain: (i) says if a point\np belongs to the interior of an interval x \u2208 D, the subintervals left(x)\u2293 p and\np \u2293 right(x) both have nonempty interior; (ii) says an interval has nonempty\ninterior iff all intervals that contain it have nonempty interior locally; (iii)\nexplains the behavior of endpoints when taking suprema.\nFor a globally hyperbolic (X, \u2264), we define left : IX \u2192 IX :: [a, b] 7\u2192 [a]\nand right : IX \u2192 IX :: [a, b] 7\u2192 [b].\nLemma 6.8 If (X, \u2264) is a globally hyperbolic poset, then (IX, left, right) is\nan interval domain.\nIn essence, we now prove that this is the only example.\nDefinition 6.9 The category IN of interval domains and commutative maps\nis given by\n\u2022 objects Interval domains (D, left, right).\n\u2022 arrows Scott continuous f : D \u2192 E that commute with left and right,\ni.e., such that both\nD\n\nleftD \u2732\n\nf\n\nD\nf\n\n\u2744\n\nE\n\nleftE\n\n\u2744\n\u2732E\n\nand\nD\n\nrightD\u2732\n\nf\n\nD\nf\n\n\u2744\n\nE\n\nrightE\n\ncommute.\n15\n\n\u2744\n\u2732E\n\n\f\u2022 identity 1 : D \u2192 D.\n\u2022 composition f \u25e6 g.\nDefinition 6.10 The category G is given by\n\u2022 objects Globally hyperbolic posets (X, \u2264).\n\u2022 arrows Continuous in the interval topology, monotone.\n\u2022 identity 1 : X \u2192 X.\n\u2022 composition f \u25e6 g.\nIt is routine to verify that IN and G are categories.\nProposition 6.11 The correspondence I : G \u2192 IN given by\n(X, \u2264) 7\u2192 (IX, left, right)\n(f : X \u2192 Y ) 7\u2192 (f \u0304 : IX \u2192 IY )\nis a functor between categories.\nProof.

This proves the claim.\n(ii) This proof is simply the dual of (i), using property (iii)(b) of interval\ndomains. \u2737\n17\n\n\fLemma 6.14 Let D be an interval domain. If \u2191x 6= \u2205 in D, then\n^\nS \u2264 left(x) \u21d2 (\u2203s \u2208 S) s \u2264 right(x)\n\nfor any \u2264-filtered S \u2286 max(D) with an infimum in (max(D), \u2264).\nV\nProof. Let S \u2286 max(D) be a \u2264-filtered set with\nS \u2264 left(x). There is\nV\nsome [a, b] with x = \u03c6\u22121 [a, b]. Setting y := \u03c6\u22121 [ S, b], we have y \u2291 x and\n\u2191x 6= \u2205, so property (ii)(c) of interval domains says y \u226a left(y) in [left(y), *].\nThen\nG\n^\ny \u226a left(y) =\n\u03c6\u22121 [ S, s]\ns\u2208S\n\nV\nwhere this set is \u2291-directed because S is \u2264-filtered. Thus, y \u2291 \u03c6\u22121 [ S, s]\nfor some s \u2208 S, which gives s \u2264 b. \u2737\nLemma 6.15 Let D be an interval domain. Then\nW\n(i) The set \u2193x is \u2264-directed with \u2193x = x.\n\n(ii) For all a, b \u2208 max(D), a \u226a bVin (max(D), \u2264) iff for all \u2264-filtered\nS \u2286 max(D) with an infimum, S \u2264 a \u21d2 (\u2203s \u2208 S) s \u2264 b.\nV\n(iii) The set \u2191x is \u2264-filtered with \u2191x = x.\n\nThus, the poset (max(D), \u2264) is bicontinuous.\n\nProof. (i) By Lemma 6.12, if x \u226a p in D, then left(x) \u226a p in max(D).\nThen the set\nT = {left(x) : x \u226a p in D} \u2286 \u2193p\nW\nis \u2264-directed. We will prove S = p. To see this,\nS = {\u03c6\u22121 [left(x), p] : x \u226a p in D}\n\nis a directed subset of [*, p], so by Lemma 6.13(ii),\nG\n_\nleft( S) =\nT.\n\nF\nF\nT\n\u22121 [a, b], where [a, b] =\nNow we calculate\nS.\nWe\nknow\nS\n=\n\u03c6\n[left(x), p].\nF\nF\nAssume S 6= p. ByFmaximality of p, p 6\u2291 S, so there must be an x \u2208 D\nwith x \u226a p and x 6\u2291 S. Then [a, b] 6\u2286 [left(x), right(x)], so either\nleft(x) 6\u2264 a or b 6\u2264 right(x)\n18\n\n\fBut, [a, b] \u2286 [left(x), p] for any x \u226a p in D, so we have left(x) \u2264 a and\nb \u2264 p \u2264 right(x), which is a contradiction. Thus,\nG\nG\n_\np=\nS = left( S) =\nT,\n\nand since\nW \u2193p contains a \u2264-directed set with sup p, \u2193p itself is \u2264-directed\nwith \u2193p = p. This proves (max(D), \u2264) is a continuous poset.\n(ii) (\u21d2) Let a \u226a b in max(D). Let x := \u03c6\u22121 [a, b]. We first prove \u2191x 6= \u2205\nusing property (ii)(b) of interval domains. Let y \u2291 x with y \u2208 [a, *]. We\nneed to show y \u226a right(y) F\nin the poset [*, right(y)]. Let\nF S \u2286 [*, right(y)]\nbe directed with right(y) \u2291 S and hence right(y) = S by maximality.\nUsing Lemma 6.13(ii),\nG\nG\n_\nright(y) =\nS = left( S) =\nleft(s)\ns\u2208S\n\nW\n\nBut y \u2291 x, so b \u2264 right(y) = s\u2208S left(s), and since a \u226a b, a \u2264 left(s) for\nsome s \u2208 S. Then since for this same s, we have\nleft(y) = a \u2264 left(s) \u2264 right(s) = right(y)\nwhich means y \u2291 s. Then y \u226a right(y) in the poset [*, right(y)]. By property\n(ii)(b), we have \u2191x 6= \u2205, so Lemma 6.14 now gives the desired result.\n(ii) (\u21d0) First, S = {a} is one such filtered set, so a \u2264 b. Let x = \u03c6\u22121 [a, b].\nWe prove \u2191x 6= \u2205 using axiom (ii)(c) of interval domains. Let y \u2291 x with\ny \u2208 [*, b]. To prove\ny \u226a left(y) in [left(y), *], F\nlet S \u2286 [left(y), *] be directed\nF\nwith left(y) \u2291 S. By maximality, left(y) = S. By Lemma 6.13(i),\nG\nG\n^\nleft(y) =\nS = right( S) =\nright(s)\ns\u2208S\n\nand {right(s) : s \u2208 S} is \u2264-filtered. Since y \u2291 x,\n^\nright(s) = left(y) \u2264 left(x) = a,\ns\u2208S\n\nso by assumption, right(s) \u2264 b, for some s \u2208 S. Then for this same s,\nleft(y) = left(s) \u2264 right(s) \u2264 b = right(y)\nwhich means y \u2291 s. Then y \u226a left(y) in [left(y), *]. By property (ii)(c)\nof interval domains, \u2191x 6= \u2205. By Lemma 6.12, taking any p \u2208 \u2191x, we get\na = left(x) \u226a p \u226a right(x) = b.\n(iii) Because of the characterization of \u226a in (ii), this proof is simply the\ndual of (i). \u2737\n\n19\n\n\fLemma 6.16 Let (D, left, right) be an interval domain. Then\n(i) If a \u226a p \u226a b in (max(D), \u2264), then \u03c6\u22121 [a, b] \u226a p in D.\n(ii) The interval topology on (max(D), \u2264) is the relative Scott topology\nmax(D) inherits from D.\nThus, the poset (max(D), \u2264) is globally hyperbolic.\nF\nF\nProof. (i) Let S \u2286 D be directed with p \u2291 S. Then p = S by maximality. The sets L = {\u03c6\u22121 [left(s), p] : s \u2208 S} and R = {\u03c6\u22121 [p, right(s)] : s \u2208 S}\nare both directed in D. For their suprema, Lemma 6.13 gives\nG\n_\nG\n^\nleft( L) =\nleft(s) & right( R) =\nright(s)\ns\u2208S\n\ns\u2208S\n\nW\nV\nSince s \u2291 \u03c6\u22121 [ s\u2208S left(s), s\u2208S right(s)] for all s \u2208 S,\n#\n\"\n_\n^\nG\nleft(s),\nright(s) ,\np=\nS \u2291 \u03c6\u22121\ns\u2208S\n\ns\u2208S\n\nand so\n_\n\nleft(s) = p =\n\ns\u2208S\n\n^\n\nright(s).\n\ns\u2208S\n\nSince a \u226a p, there is s1 \u2208 S with a \u2264 left(s1 ). Since p \u226a b, there is s2 \u2208 S\nwith right(s2 ) \u2264 b, using bicontinuity of max(D). By the directedness of S,\nthere is s \u2208 S with s1 , s2 \u2291 s, which gives\na \u2264 left(s1 ) \u2264 left(s) \u2264 right(s) \u2264 right(s2 ) \u2264 b\nwhich proves \u03c6\u22121 [a, b] \u2291 s.\n(ii) Combining (i) and Lemma 6.12,\na \u226a p \u226a b in (max(D), \u2264) \u21d4 \u03c6\u22121 [a, b] \u226a p in D.\nThus, the identity map 1 : (max(D), \u2264) \u2192 (max(D), \u03c3) sends basic open\nsets in the interval topology to basic open sets in the relative Scott topology,\nand conversely, so the two spaces are homeomorphic.\nFinally, since \u2191x \u2229 max(D) = {p \u2208 max(D) : left(x) \u2264 p \u2264 right(x)}, and\nthis set is Scott compact, it must also be compact in the interval topology\non (max(D), \u2264), since they are homeomorphic. \u2737\n\n20\n\n\fProposition 6.17 The correspondence max : IN \u2192 G given by\n(D, left, right) 7\u2192 (max(D), \u2264)\n(f : D \u2192 E) 7\u2192 (f |max(D) : max(D) \u2192 max(E))\nis a functor between categories.\nProof. First, commutative maps f : D \u2192 E preserve maximal elements:\nIf x \u2208 max(D), then f (x) = f (leftD (x)) = leftE \u25e6 f (x) \u2208 max(E). By\nLemma 6.16(ii), f |max(D) is continuous with respect to the interval topology.\nFor monotonicity, let a \u2264 b in max(D) and x := \u03c6\u22121 [a, b] \u2208 D. Then\nleftE \u25e6 f (x) = f (leftD (x)) = f (a)\nand\nrightE \u25e6 f (x) = f (rightD (x)) = f (b)\nwhich means f (a) \u2264 f (b), by the definition of \u2264 on max(E).\n\n\u2737\n\nBefore the statement of the main theorem in this section, we recall the\ndefinition of a natural isomorphism.\nDefinition 6.18 A natural transformation \u03b7 : F \u2192 G between functors\nF : C \u2192 D and G : C \u2192 D is a collection of arrows (\u03b7X : F (X) \u2192 G(X))X\u2208 C\nsuch that for any arrow f : A \u2192 B in C,\nF (A)\n\n\u03b7A \u2732\n\nF (f )\n\nG(A)\nG(f )\n\n\u2744\n\nF (B)\n\n\u03b7B\n\n\u2744\n\u2732 G(B)\n\ncommutes. If each \u03b7X is an isomorphism, \u03b7 is a natural isomorphism.\nCategories C and D are equivalent when there are functors F : C \u2192 D\nand G : D \u2192 C and natural isomorphisms \u03b7 : 1C \u2192 GF and \u03bc : 1D \u2192 F G.\nTheorem 6.19 The category of globally hyperbolic posets is equivalent to\nthe category of interval domains.\n\n21\n\n\fProof. We have natural isomorphisms\n\u03b7 : 1IN \u2192 I \u25e6 max\nand\n\u03bc : 1G \u2192 max \u25e6 I\n\u2737\nThis result suggests that questions about spacetime can be converted to\ndomain theoretic form, where we can use domain theory to answer them, and\nthen translate the answers back to the language of physics (and vice-versa).\nIt also shows that causality between events is equivalent to an order\non regions of spacetime. Most importanly, we have shown that globally\nhyperbolic spacetime with causality is equivalent to a structure IX whose\norigins are \"discrete.\" This is the formal explanation for why spacetime\ncan be reconstructed from a countable dense set of events in a purely order\ntheoretic manner.\n\n7\n\nConclusion and future work\n\nWe have shown that globally hyperbolic spacetimes live in a category that\nis equivalent to the category of interval domains. Because \u03c9-continuous\ndomains are the ideal completions of countable abstract bases, spacetime\ncan be order theoretically reconstructed from a dense 'discrete' set. (Ideally\nwe would like to remove the requirement that the set be dense by assuming\nsome additional structure and using it to derive a dense set.) Thus, with the\nbenefit of the domain theoretic viewpoint, we are able to see that a globally\nhyperbolic spacetime emanates from something discrete.\nIt is now natural to ask about the domain theoretic analogue of 'Lorentz\nmetric', and the authors suspect it is related to the study of measurement\n([5][6]). After that, we should ask about the domain theoretic analogue\nof Einstein's equation, etc. Given a reformulation of general relativity in\ndomain theoretic terms, a first step toward a theory of quantum gravity\nwould be to restrict to a countable abstract basis with a measurement. The\nadvantage though of the domain theoretic formulation is that we will know\nup front how to reconstruct 'classical' general relativity as an order theoretic\n'limit' \u2013 which is what one is not currently able to do with the standard\nformulation of general relativity.\n\n22\n\n\fReferences\n[1] S.

Abstract\nbases are covered in [1], which is where one finds the following.\nDefinition 7.2 An ideal in (B, <) is a nonempty subset I of B such that\n(i) I is a lower set: ( \u2200 x \u2208 B )( \u2200 y \u2208 I ) x < y \u21d2 x \u2208 I.\n(ii) I is directed: ( \u2200 x, y \u2208 I )( \u2203 z \u2208 I ) x, y < z.\nThe collection of ideals of an abstract basis (B, <) ordered under inclusion\nis a partially ordered set called the ideal completion of B. We denote this\nposet by B\u0304.\nThe set {y \u2208 B : y < x} for x \u2208 B is an ideal which leads to a natural\nmapping from B into B, given by i(x) = {y \u2208 B : y < x}.\nProposition 7.3 If (B, <) is an abstract basis, then\n(i) Its ideal completion B\u0304 is a dcpo.\n(ii) For I, J \u2208 B\u0304,\nI \u226a J \u21d4 ( \u2203 x, y \u2208 B ) x < y & I \u2286 i(x) \u2286 i(y) \u2286 J.\n(iii) B\u0304 is a continuous dcpo with basis i(B).\nIf one takes any basis B of a domain D and restricts the approximation\nrelation \u226a on D to B, they are left with an abstract basis (B, \u226a) whose\nideal completion is D. Thus, all domains arise as the ideal completion of an\nabstract basis.\n\n24\n\n\fAppendix: Topology\nNets are a generalization of sequences.
