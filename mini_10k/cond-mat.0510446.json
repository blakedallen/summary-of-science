Among the major conclusions of this paper, is\nthe fact that the entire band structure can be characterized by a single, though multi-valued, analytic function\nE(\u03bb)[\u03bb = eikb ], with branch points that occur at complex k. A similar conclusion holds also for the Bloch\nfunctions. The positions of the branch points determine\nthe exponential decay of the Wannier functions. For insulators, they also determine the exponential decay of the\ndensity matrix and other correlation functions. It was\nrecently shown that the order of the branch points determines the additional inverse power law decay of these\nfunctions.2 We can say that, although the branch points\noccur at complex k, their existence and location have very\nimportant implications on the properties and dynamics\nof the physical states. The complex k wavefunctions are\nalso important when describing surface and defect states,\nmetal-insulator junctions and electrical transport across\nfinite crystals and linear molecular chains.3,4,5,6\nThe methods developed in Ref. 1 could not be extended to higher dimensions, where the results are much\nmore limited. The first major step here was made by\nDes Cloizeaux, who studied the analytic structure near\nreal k \u2032 s, for crystals with a center of inversion.7,8 His\nconclusion was that the Bloch functions and energies of\nan isolated simple band are analytic (and periodic) in\na complex strip around the real k \u2032 s. The restriction to\ncrystals with center of symmetry was later removed.9 The\nanalytic structure has been reconsidered in a study by\nAvron and Simon,10 who gave answers to some important, tough qualitative questions. For example, one of\ntheir conclusion was that all isolated singularities of the\nband energy are algebraic branch points. The topology\nof the Riemann surface of the Bloch functions for finite\ngap potentials in two dimensions has been investigated\nin a series of studies by Novikov et al.11 The analytic\nstructure has been also investigated by purely numerical\n\nmethods. Since it is impossible to explore numerically the\nentire complex plane, numerical methods cannot provide\nthe global structure. Even so, they can provide valuable\ninformation. For example, in the complex band calculations for Si,12 or linear molecular chains,13,14 one can\nclearly see how the bands are connected, even though\nthese studies explored only the real axis of the complex\nenergy plane.\nIn this paper we consider linear molecular chains, described by a Hamiltonian of the form\nH = \u2212\u22072 + v(r),\n\n(1)\n\nwith v(r) periodic with respect to one of the cartesian\ncoordinates of R3 , let us say z:\nv(x, y, z + b) = v(x, y, z).\n\n(2)\n\nThe wavefunctions of H are Bloch waves, \u03c8n,\u03bb (r), with\nthe fundamental property\n\u03c8n,\u03bb (x, y, z + b) = \u03bb\u03c8n,\u03bb (x, y, z),\n\u2202z \u03c8n,\u03bb (x, y, z + b) = \u03bb\u2202z \u03c8n,\u03bb (x, y, z).\n\n(3)\n\nWe derive the generic analytic structure (the Riemann\nsurface) of \u03c8n,\u03bb (r) and of the corresponding energy En (\u03bb)\nas functions of complex \u03bb. We shall see that they are\ndifferent branches of two analytic functions, \u03c8\u03bb (r) and\nE(\u03bb), with an essential singularity at \u03bb = 0 and additional branch points which, generically, are of order 3,\nrespectively 1. We show where this branch points come\nfrom, how they move when the potential is changed and,\nin some cases, how to estimate their location.\nOur strategy is as follows. According to Bloch theorem, we can restrict z to z \u2208 [0, b] and study the following\nclass of Hamiltonians, which will be called Bloch Hamiltonians:\nH\u03bb = \u2212\u22072 + v(r), z \u2208 [0, b],\n\n(4)\n\nwith \u03bb referring to the following boundary conditions:\n\u001a\n\u03c8(x, y, b) = \u03bb\u03c8(x, y, 0),\n(5)\n\u2202z \u03c8(x, y, b) = \u03bb\u2202z \u03c8(x, y, 0),\n\n\f2\nwhich define the domain of H\u03bb . For z \u2208 [0, b], the eigenvectors of H\u03bb and their corresponding energies coincide\nwith \u03c8n,\u03bb (r) and En (\u03bb). Let \u03c1(H\u03bb ) denote the resolvent\nset of H\u03bb , which is composed of those points in the complex energy plane for which (z \u2212H\u03bb )\u22121 is bounded. Now,\nit was long known that the Green's function, (z \u2212 H\u03bb )\u22121 ,\nevaluated at some arbitrary point z \u2208 \u03c1(H\u03bb ), is analytic\nof \u03bb, for any \u03bb in the complex plane.17 In Section II,\nwe derive the local analytic structure of the eigenvectors\nand eigenvalues as functions of \u03bb, starting from this observation alone. To obtain the global analytic structure,\nwe start with a simple v(r), with known global analytic\nstructure, and then study how this structure changes\nwhen v(r) is modified.\nWhen this formalism is applied to 1D periodic systems, all the conclusions (and a few additional ones) of\nRef. 1 follow with no extra effort. This is done in Section III. Section IV presents the results for linear chains.\nWe have two applications: a compact expression for the\nGreen's function, which is developed in Section V, and\nthe computation of the asymptotic behavior of the density matrix for insulating linear molecular chains, which\nis done in Section VI. We conclude with remarks on how\nto calculate the analytic structure for real systems. We\nalso have two Appendices with mathematical details.\n\nII.\n\n*\nJ\nd\n\n(O\n(c\nJ'\nd\n\n(O'\n\nFIG. 1: The figure shows two isolated eigenvalues of H\u03bb , E\u03bb\nand E\u03bb\u2032 , that become equal for \u03bb = \u03bbc . The figure also shows\nthe contours of integration, \u0393, \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2032 used in the text.\n\nAs shown in Appendix A, Eqs. (6) and (7) automatically\nimply that E\u03bb is analytic at \u03bb0 . Since \u03bb0 was chosen arbitrarily, we can conclude that the non-degenerate eigenvalues are analytic functions of \u03bb, as long as they stay\nisolated from the rest of the spectrum.\nSuppose now that H\u03bb has two isolated, non-degenerate\neigenvalues, E\u03bb and E\u03bb\u2032 , which become equal at some \u03bbc\n(see Fig. 1):\n\nGENERAL FORMALISM\n\nE\u03bbc = E\u03bb\u2032 c = Ec .\nWe consider here, at a general and abstract level, an\nanalytic family, {H\u03bb }\u03bb\u2208C , of closed, possibly non selfadjoint operators. The analyticity is considered in the\nsense of Kato,15 which means that, for any z \u2208 \u03c1(H\u03bb ),\nthe Green's function can be expanded as\n(z \u2212 H\u03bb\u2032 )\u22121 =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(\u03bb\u2032 \u2212 \u03bb)n Rn (z),\n\n(6)\n\nn=0\n\nwith the power series converging in the topology induced\nby the operator norm, for any \u03bb\u2032 in a finite vicinity of \u03bb.\nWe have already mentioned that the Bloch Hamiltonians\nform an analytic family.\nIn this section, we discuss the analytic structure of\nthe eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors of H\u03bb ,\nas functions of \u03bb, based solely on the analyticity of the\nGreen's function. For this, we need to find ways of expressing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors using only the\nGreen's function. The major challenge will be posed by\nthe degeneracies.\nSuppose H\u03bb has an isolated, non-degenerate eigenvalue\nE\u03bb , for \u03bb near \u03bb0 . Then there exists a closed contour \u0393\nseparating E\u03bb0 from the rest of the spectrum. For \u03bb in\na sufficiently small vicinity of \u03bb0 , E\u03bb remains the only\neigenvalue inside \u0393 and we can express E\u03bb as\nE\u03bb = T r\n\nZ\n\n\u0393\n\nz(z \u2212 H\u03bb )\u22121\n\ndz\n.\n2\u03c0i\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nWe are interested in the analytic structure of these eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors, for \u03bb in a vicinity\nof \u03bbc .\nEq. (7) is no longer useful, since there is no such \u03bbindependent contour \u0393 that isolates one eigenvalue from\nthe rest of the spectrum, for all \u03bb in a vicinity of \u03bbc . The\nkey is to work with both eigenvalues, since we can still\nfind a \u03bb-independent contour \u0393, separating E\u03bb and E\u03bb\u2032\nfrom the rest of the spectrum (see Fig. 1), as long as \u03bb\nstays in a sufficiently small vicinity of \u03bbc . We define,\nFm (\u03bb) = (E\u03bb )m + (E\u03bb\u2032 )m , m = 1, 2, . . . .\n\n(9)\n\nThe main observation is that we can use the Green's function to express Fm (\u03bb):\nZ\ndz\nFm (\u03bb) = T r z m (z \u2212 H\u03bb )\u22121\n.\n(10)\n2\u03c0i\n\u0393\nThen, as shown in Appendix A, it follows from Eqs. (6)\nand (10) that Fm (\u03bb) are analytic functions near and at\n\u03bbc .\nThe functions introduced in Eq. (9) provide the following representation:\ni\np\n1h\nF1 (\u03bb) + 2F2 (\u03bb) \u2212 F1 (\u03bb)2\n2\ni\np\n1h\nF1 (\u03bb) \u2212 2F2 (\u03bb) \u2212 F1 (\u03bb)2 .\n=\n2\n\nE\u03bb =\nE\u03bb\u2032\n\n(11)\n\n\f3\nThus, we managed to express the eigenvalues in terms of\nthe Green's function alone. The analytic function,\nG(\u03bb) \u2261 2F2 (\u03bb) \u2212 F1 (\u03bb)2 ,\n\n(12)\n\nmust have a zero at \u03bbc , so its generic behavior near \u03bbc is\nG(\u03bb) = (\u03bb \u2212 \u03bbc )K g(\u03bb),\n\n(13)\n\nwith K an integer larger or equal to 1 and g(\u03bb) analytic\nand non-zero at \u03bbc . The cases when K > 2 are very special and will not be considered here. Only the following\ntwo possibilities are relevant to us:\n\u001a\n(\u03bb \u2212 \u03bbc )g(\u03bb) (type I)\nG(\u03bb) =\n(14)\n(\u03bb \u2212 \u03bbc )2 g(\u03bb) (type II),\nwhere g(\u03bb) is analytic and has no zeros in a vicinity of\n\u03bbc .\nFor a type I degeneracy, as \u03bb loops around \u03bbc , E\u03bb\nbecomes E\u03bb\u2032 and vice versa. The two eigenvalues are\ndifferent branches of a double-valued analytic function,\nwith a branch point of order 1 at \u03bbc :\nE\u03bb = Ec + \u03b1(\u03bb \u2212 \u03bbc )1/2 + . . . .\n\n(15)\n\nFor a type II degeneracy, both E\u03bb and E\u03bb\u2032 are analytic\nnear \u03bbc .\nWe consieder now the spectral projectors, P\u03bb and P\u03bb\u2032 ,\nassociated with E\u03bb and E\u03bb\u2032 , respectively. For \u03bb 6= \u03bbc ,\nthey have the following representation:\nZ\ndz\n,\n(16)\nP\u03bb = (z \u2212 H\u03bb )\u22121\n2\u03c0i\n\u03b3\nwhere \u03b3 is defined by |z \u2212 E\u03bb | = d, with d small enough\n(thus \u03bb dependent) so E\u03bb\u2032 lies outside \u03b3 (see Fig. 1). P\u03bb\u2032\nhas a completely equivalent representation. We list the\nfollowing properties:\nP\u03bb2 = P\u03bb , P\u03bb\u20322 = P\u03bb\u2032\nP\u03bb P\u03bb\u2032 = P\u03bb\u2032 P\u03bb = 0.\n\n(17)\n\nFor a type I degeneracy, as \u03bb loops around \u03bbc , P\u03bb becomes P\u03bb\u2032 and vice versa. Thus, P\u03bb and P\u03bb\u2032 are different branches of a double-valued analytic function, with\nbranch point of order 1 at \u03bbc . In other words, they\nare given by the same function (identified from now on\nwith P\u03bb ), which is evaluated on different Riemann sheets.\nThese sheets have \u03bbc as a common point. Thus, if P\u03bb does\nnot diverge at \u03bbc , then\nlim P\u03bb = lim P\u03bb\u2032 .\n\n\u03bb\u2192\u03bbc\n\n\u03bb\u2192\u03bbc\n\nP\u03bb P\u03bb\u2032\n\n(18)\n\nBut this will contradict, for example,\n= 0. We must\nconclude that P\u03bb diverges at \u03bbc . To find out the form of\nthe singularity, we observe that, if \u2206E\u03bb denotes the difference E\u03bb \u2212 E\u03bb\u2032 , then \u2206E\u03bb P\u03bb has a well defined limit at\n\u03bbc , which can be seen from the following representation:\nZ\ndz\n\u2206E\u03bb P\u03bb = (z \u2212 E\u03bb\u2032 )(z \u2212 H\u03bb )\u22121\n.\n(19)\n2\u03c0i\n\u0393\n\nSince \u2206E\u03bb \u221d (\u03bb \u2212 \u03bbc )1/2 , we can conclude that the singularity of P\u03bb is of the form (\u03bb \u2212 \u03bbc )\u22121/2 . In addition,\nwe mention that the total spectral projector,\nP (\u03bb) = P\u03bb + P\u03bb\u2032 ,\n\n(20)\n\nis analytic near and at \u03bbc , as it can be seen from the\nrepresentation\nZ\ndz\n,\n(21)\nP (\u03bb) = (z \u2212 H\u03bb )\u22121\n2\u03c0i\n\u0393\nand that the Green function for \u03bb = \u03bbc and z near Ec\nhas the following structure:\n(z \u2212 H\u03bbc )\u22121 = (z \u2212 Ec )\u22122 lim \u2206E\u03bb P\u03bb\n\u03bb\u2192\u03bbc\n\n\u22121\n\n+(z \u2212 Ec )\n\nP (\u03bbc ) + R(z),\n\n(22)\n\nwith R(z) analytic near Ec . This expression is interesting\nbecause the Green's function of self-adjoint operators,\nviewed as functions of z, always have simple poles. Thus,\nH\u03bbc cannot be a self-adjoint operator. In other words,\ntype I degeneracies cannot occur for those values of \u03bb for\nwhich H\u03bb is self-adjoint.\nWe now turn our attention to the eigenvectors. Since,\nfor \u03bb 6= \u03bbc , P\u03bb is rank one, it can be written as\nP\u03bb = |\u03c8\u03bb ih\u03c8\u0304\u03bb |,\n\n(23)\n\nwith \u03c8\u03bb (\u03c8\u0304\u03bb ) the eigenvector to the left (right), normalized as\nh\u03c8\u0304\u03bb , \u03c8\u03bb i = 1.\n\n(24)\n\nAs explained in Ref. 16, passing from the projector to\nthe eigenvectors is not a trivial matter, since these vectors are defined up to a phase factor. The question is,\ncan we choose or define these phases so that no additional\nsingularities are introduced? We can give a positive answer when there is an anti-unitary transformation, Q,\nsuch that:\nH\u03bb\u2020 = QH\u03bb Q\u22121 .\n\n(25)\n\nAs we shall later see, such Q exists, for example, when\nv(x, y, z) = v(x, y, \u2212z). Now fix an arbitrary \u03c8 and observe that\nP\u03bb =\n\nP\u03bb |\u03c8ihQ\u03c8|P\u03bb\n\nhP\u03bb\u2020 Q\u03c8, P\u03bb \u03c8i\n\n.\n\n(26)\n\nOne immediate problem with the above expression is that\nthe denominator can be zero. This can happen only for\nisolated values of \u03bb for, otherwise, the denominator will\nbe identically zero. Let \u03bb0 be such value, assumed different from the branch point (we can always choose a \u03c8\nsatisfying this condition). We know that the only singularity of P\u03bb is at \u03bbc , so what we have is two functions that\nare equal on a domain surrounding \u03bb0 but excluding \u03bb0 ,\nand one of them, P\u03bb , is analytic at \u03bb0 . Then it is a fact\n\n\f4\nthat both functions are analytic at \u03bb0 . This means the\nnumerator in the right hand side of Eq. (26) must also\ncancel at \u03bb0 , with the same power as the denominator\nand the problem disappears. Then, it is natural to think\nthat we can define the left and right eigenvectors of H\u03bb\nas:\n|\u03c8\u03bb i =\n\nP\u03bb |\u03c8i\n\u2020\nhP\u03bb Q\u03c8, P\u03bb \u03c8i1/2\n\n(27)\n\nand\n|\u03c8\u0304\u03bb i =\n\nP\u03bb\u2020 Q|\u03c8i\n\n(28)\n\nhP\u03bb\u2020 Q\u03c8, P\u03bb \u03c8i1/2\n\nUsing the properties of Q, we can equivalently write:\n|\u03c8\u03bb i =\n\nP\u03bb |\u03c8i\n, |\u03c8\u0304\u03bb i = Q|\u03c8\u03bb i.\nhQP\u03bb \u03c8, P\u03bb \u03c8i1/2\n\n(29)\n\nThe only problem is the following: the denominator in\nEq. (26) behaves like (\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 )\u03b1 near \u03bb0 , with \u03b1 some\nunknown power. As we already seen, the numerator of\nEq. (26) must have exactly the same behavior. Now let\nus look at Eq. (29): the denominator of \u03c8\u03bb behaves like\n(\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 )\u03b1/2 , but the numerator can behave like (\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 )r\nwith r arbitrary, as long as the numerator of \u03c8\u0304\u03bb behaves\nlike (\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 )\u03b1\u2212r . However, we show in the following the\nr is exactly \u03b1/2. If Q cannot be defined, then this is\nno longer true. You may think that, in such cases, we\nshould modify the denominator of \u03c8\u03bb to hQP\u03bb \u03c8, P\u03bb \u03c8ir .\nThe problem is that \u03bb0 is not unique so this may fix the\nproblem at \u03bb0 but not at other similar points.\nNow let\nP\u03bb =\n\n\u221e\nX\ni=0\n\ni\n\n(\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 ) Pi\n\n(30)\n\nbe the expansion of P\u03bb near \u03bb0 . If the numerator of\nEq. (26) cancel at \u03bb0 , an expansion in powers of \u03bb will\nshow that this cancelation is equivalent to:\nPi |\u03c8i = 0, for all i < K,\n\n(31)\n\nwith K an integer larger or equal to 1. This also means\nP\u03bb |\u03c8i =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\ni=K\n\n(\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 )i Pi |\u03c8i \u2261 (\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 )K |\u03c6\u03bb i.\n\n(32)\n\nLet us assume, for the beginning, that K = 1, in which\ncase P1 |\u03c8i =\n6 0. The numerator of Eq. (26) becomes\n2\n\n3\n\n|P\u03bb \u03c8ihP\u03bb \u03c8|Q = (\u03bb\u2212\u03bb0 ) |P1 \u03c8ihP1 \u03c8|Q+o(\u03bb\u2212\u03bb0 ) (33)\n\nthat numerator and denominator must cancel with the\nsame power, so this must be so. We can repeat the same\narguments for arbitrary K and the conclusion will be the\nsame:\nhQP\u03bb \u03c8, P\u03bb \u03c8i = (\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 )2K g(\u03bb)\n|P\u03bb \u03c8i = (\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 )K |\u03c6\u03bb i,\n\nwith g(\u03bb) and |\u03c6\u03bb i analytic and non-zero near \u03bb0 . Thus,\nwe can take the square root in Eq. (29) without introducing a branch point. We can also see that the denominator and numerator in Eq. (29) cancel at \u03bb0 with the\nsame power, so there is no pole at \u03bb0 . The conclusion is\nthat \u03c8\u03bb is analytic at \u03bb0 .\nThere will be, inherently, a branch point at \u03bbc , where\n\u03c8\u03bb and \u03c8\u0304\u03bb\u2217 behave as\nc(r)\n+ d(r) + . . . ,\n(\u03bb \u2212 \u03bbc )1/4\nc\u0304(r)\n \u0304 + ...\n+ d(r)\n\u03c8\u0304\u03bb\u2217 (r) =\n(\u03bb \u2212 \u03bbc )1/4\n\u03c8\u03bb (r) =\n\nAlthough P1 |\u03c8i =\n6 0, we are not automatically guaranteed that hQP1 \u03c8, P1 \u03c8i 6= 0. However, we already argued\n\n(36)\n(37)\n\ni.e. \u03c8\u03bb and \u03c8\u0304\u03bb\u2217 have a branch point of order 3 at \u03bbc . If the\noperator Q with the above mentioned properties exists,\nthis is their only singularity near \u03bbc .\nFor a type II degeneracy, P\u03bb and P\u03bb\u2032 are analytic near\n\u03bbc . The eigenvectors can be introduce in the same way\nas above and, if Q exists, they are analytic functions of\n\u03bb.\nAnalytic deformations. We analyze now what happens\nwhen an analytic potential w is added:\nH\u03bb,\u03b3 = H\u03bb + \u03b3w.\n\n(38)\n\nBy analytic potential we mean that {H\u03bb,\u03b3 }\u03bb,\u03b3\u2208C is an\nanalytic family in the sense of Kato, in both \u03bb and \u03b3 (see\nAppendix B).\nFor any fixed \u03b3, the isolated, non-degenerate eigenvalues of H\u03bb,\u03b3 remain analytic of \u03bb. The interesting question\nis what happens with the degeneracies. Suppose that,\nat some fixed \u03b30 , there are two isolated, non-degenerate\n\u2032\neigenvalues, E\u03bb,\u03b30 and E\u03bb,\u03b3\n, which become equal at \u03bbc .\n0\nFor \u03bb in a small vicinity of \u03bbc and \u03b3 in a small vicinity\nof \u03b30 , we can define the functions F1,2 (\u03bb, \u03b3) and G(\u03bb, \u03b3)\nas before, which are now analytic functions in both arguments, (\u03bb, \u03b3), near (\u03bbc , \u03b30 ).\nIf at \u03b30 , \u03bbc is a type I degeneracy, the only effect of a\nvariation in \u03b3 is a shift of \u03bbc . Indeed, since\nG(\u03bbc , \u03b30 ) = 0, \u2202\u03bb G(\u03bbc , \u03b30 ) 6= 0,\n\n(39)\n\nthe analytic implicit function theorem assures us that\nthere is a unique \u03bbc (\u03b3) such that\nG(\u03bbc (\u03b3), \u03b3) = 0.\n\nand the denominator\nhQP\u03bb \u03c8, P\u03bb \u03c8i = (\u03bb\u2212\u03bb0 )2 hQP1 \u03c8, P1 \u03c8i+o(\u03bb\u2212\u03bb0 )3 . (34)\n\n(35)\n\n(40)\n\nMoreover, the zero is simple, i.e. \u03bbc (\u03b3) remains a type I\ndegeneracy.

Indeed, since\nG(\u03bbc , \u03b30 ) = \u2202\u03bb G(\u03bbc , \u03b30 ) = \u2202\u03b3 G(\u03bbc , \u03b30 ) = 0,\n\nn 2\n\n(45)\n\nthe generic structure of G(\u03bb, \u03b3) near (\u03bbc , \u03b30 ) is:\nG(\u03bb, \u03b3) = a(\u03bb\u2212 \u03bbc )2 + b(\u03bb\u2212 \u03bbc )(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b30 )+ c(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b30 )2 + . . . .\n(46)\nThus, for \u03b3 6= \u03b30 , G(\u03bb, \u03b3) will have, generically, two simple zeros (type I degeneracies) at:\ni\np\n\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b30 h\n\u03bb\u00b1\n\u2212b \u00b1 b2 \u2212 4ac + . . . .

This is a consequence\nof the fact that, if two analytic functions are equal on an\ninterval, they are equal on their entire domain.\nWe now summarize the findings of this Section. The\nisolated, non-degenerate eigenvalues of H\u03bb are analytic of\n\u03bb. Double degeneracies can be of different kinds. Type I\ndegeneracies are equivalent to branch points. Near such\ndegeneracies, E\u03bb behaves as a square root. Type I degeneracies are robust to analytic perturbations: as long\nas they stay isolated, variations of the periodic potential cannot destroy or create but only shift them. At\ntype II degeneracies, the eigenvalues are analytic. Type\nII degeneracies are unstable to analytic perturbations:\ngenerically, they split into two type I degeneracies. The\nother types of degeneracies were considered rare and not\ndiscussed here. The analytic structure of the spectral\nprojectors can be automatically deduced from the analytic structure of E(\u03bb). If there exists an anti-unitary\ntransformation, Q, such that H\u03bb\u2020 = QH\u03bb Q\u22121 , then the\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 2: a) The Riemann surface of E 0 (\u03bb) is a spiral, which\nhave been cut along the dotted lines in individual sheets, indexed by n = 0, \u00b11, . . ..

The empty dots represent\nthe branch points and the arrows indicate how the Riemann\nsheets are connected. In both panels, the thick line shows the\ntrajectory on the Riemann surface, when \u03bb moves on the unit\ncircle.\n\nphase of the eigenvectors can be chosen in a canonical\nway and their analytic structure follows automatically\nfrom the analytic structure of E(\u03bb). If such Q does not\nexists, the eigenvectors will still have singularities of the\ntype (\u03bb \u2212 \u03bbc )\u22121/4 at the branch points of E\u03bb but the\npresent analysis does not rule the existence of additional\nsingularities.\nA similar analysis can be developed for higher degeneracies. For a triple degeneracy, for example, we will\nhave to consider the functions Fm (\u03bb), with m = 1, 2, 3.\nHowever, we regard higher degeneracies as non-generic,\ni.e. more rare than simple degeneracies and will not be\nconsidered in this paper.\nIII.\n\nSTRICTLY 1D SYSTEMS\n\nWe apply here the abstract formalism to an already\nwell studied problem: the analytic structure of Bloch\nfunctions in 1D, i.e the wave functions of the following\nHamiltonian:\nH = \u2212\u2202x2 + v(x), v(x + b) = v(x), x \u2208 R.\n\n(49)\n\nAccording to Bloch theorem, finding the wave functions\nand their corresponding energies is equivalent to studying\nthe following analytic family of Hamiltonians:17\n\u0001\nH\u03bb = \u2212 \u2202x2 \u03bb + v(x), x \u2208 [0, b],\n(50)\n\ndefined in the Hilbert space of square integrable functions\nover the interval [0, b].

H\u03bb is an\nanalytic family in the sense of Kato, for all \u03bb \u2208 C. H\u03bb\nis self-adjoint if and only if \u03bb is on the unit circle. In\ngeneral, H1/\u03bb\u2217 is the adjoint of H\u03bb . If C is the complex conjugation, CH\u03bb C = H\u03bb\u2217 . Thus, H\u03bb and H\u03bb\u2217\nhave complex conjugated eigenvalues and H\u03bb and H1/\u03bb\nhave identical eigenvalues. This tells us that the analytic\nstructure is invariant to \u03bb \u2192 1/\u03bb and \u03bb \u2192 \u03bb\u2217 . Because\nof these symmetries, it is sufficient to consider only the\ndomain |\u03bb| \u2264 1. For \u03bb not necessarily on the unit circle,\nthe spectral projector on En,\u03bb is given by\nPn,\u03bb (x, y) = \u03c8n,\u03bb (x)\u03c8n,1/\u03bb (y).\n\n(54)\n\nWe consider now the following class of Hamiltonians\n\u0001\n(55)\nH\u03bb,\u03b3 = \u2212 \u2202x2 \u03bb + \u03b3v(x), v(x + b) = v(x),\n\nand we adiabatically switch \u03b3 from zero to one. As it\nis shown in Appendix B, potentials v(x) with square integrable singularities18 are analytic. Thus, the theory\n\nn 1\n\nO1\n\nFIG. 4: An equivalent representation of the Riemann surface\nof Fig. 2b. Each sheet corresponds now to one energy band.\nThe thick line shows the trajectory on the Riemann surface\nwhen \u03bb encircles the origin at a small radius.\n\ndeveloped in the previous Section can be applied to a\nlarge class of potentials.\nThe eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors of\nH\u03bb,0 are given by:\n2\n\nEn0 (\u03bb) = b\u22122 (2n\u03c0i + ln \u03bb) ,\n0\n\u03c8n,\u03bb\n(x) = b\u22121/2 e(2n\u03c0i+ln \u03bb)x/b .\n\n(56)\n\nThey are the different branches of the following multivalued analytic functions:\n2\n\nE 0 (\u03bb) = b\u22122 (ln \u03bb) , \u03c8\u03bb0 (x) = b\u22121/2 \u03bbx/b .\n\n(57)\n\nThe Riemann surface of E 0 (\u03bb) is shown in Fig. 2a. There\nare only type II degeneracies and they occur at \u03bb = \u00b11:\n0\nEn0 (\u03bb = 1) = E\u2212n\n(\u03bb = 1),\n\n0\nEn0 (\u03bb = \u22121) = E\u2212n+1\n(\u03bb = \u22121).\n\n(58)\n\nA plot of these eigenvalues for \u03bb on the unit circle is\ngiven in Fig. 3a. Now we turn on the periodic potential.\nTypically, the energy spectrum of H consists of an infinite\nset of bands separated by gaps, denoted here by \u2206n (see\nFig. 3b). When v(x) is modified, some of the gaps may\nclose and other may open. If we assume that all the\ngaps open when the periodic potential is turned on, as\nin Ref. 1, then all type II degeneracies split into pairs of\ntype I degeneracies, \u03bbc (\u03b3) and 1/\u03bbc (\u03b3), located on the\nreal axis. \u03bbc (\u03b3) and 1/\u03bbc (\u03b3) are branch points for E(\u03bb),\nwhich connect different sheets of the original Riemann\nsurface (see Fig. 2b). Since they are constrained on the\nreal axis, the trajectory of different branch points cannot\nintersect (they stay on the same Riemann sheet), i.e. the\nbranch points remain isolated as \u03b3 is increased. Thus, as\nthe previous Section showed, they move analytically as\nwe increase the coupling constant and we can conclude\n\n\f7\n\nP ( E \u0010 E j ) P ( E \u0010 Ei )\n\n1\nC\nA\n-1\nB\n\nFIG. 5: \u03bc(E \u2212 Ej ) and \u03bc(E \u2212 Ei ) as functions of E, for a\ntypical Kramers function \u03bc. The solutions to Eq. (69) are\ngiven by the intersection points A, B, C, . . . .\n\nthat the analytic structure cannot change, qualitatively,\nas we increase \u03b3.\nFor \u03b3 = 0, we move from one sheet to another as \u03bb\nmoves continuously on the unit circle, as Fig. 2a shows.\nThe situation is different for \u03b3 6= 0 (see Fig. 2b): when \u03bb\ncompletes one loop on the unit circle, we end up on the\nsame point of the Riemann surface as where we started.\nWe can then re-cut the Riemann surface, so that we stay\non the same sheet when \u03bb moves on the unit circle (see\nFig. 4).\nThus, we rediscovered one of the main conclusions of\nRef. 1. The eigenvalues En (\u03bb) are different branches of\na multi-valued analytic function E(\u03bb) with a Riemann\nsurface shown in Fig. 4: there are branch points or order\n1 at \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , . . ., and an essential singularity at 0.

Thus, for systems with inversion symmetry, we can also conclude at once that the\nonly branch points of the Bloch functions are \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , . . . ,\nwhich are of order 3 (see Eqs. (36)). The present analysis actually adds something new to the results of Ref. 1,\nwhere the author studied two particular phase choices\nof the Bloch functions, namely, those imposed by \u03c8\u03bb (x)\n(|\u03bb| = 1) being real at the points of inversion symmetry, x = 0 and x = b/2. The author warns that other\nchoices can introduce additional singularities and thus\nreduce the exponential localization of the corresponding\nWannier functions. A frequently used method of generating Wannier functions localized near an arbitrary x0 is\nto impose Im\u03c8\u03bb (x0 ) = 0. Since such a phase choice corresponds to choosing \u03c8(x) = \u03b4(x\u2212x0 ) in Eq. (29), we can\n\nFIG. 6: a) Enj j (\u03bb) and Eni i (\u03bb) as functions of real kz (\u03bb =\neikz b ) for case A.

The thick line\nshows a trajectory on the Riemann surface when \u03bb completes\na loop around the origin.\n\nThe general facts about H\u03bb listed in the previous Section\nare still valid. Again, the analytic structure is invariant\nto \u03bb \u2192 \u03bb\u2217 and \u03bb \u2192 \u03bb\u22121 so we can and shall restrict the\ndomain of \u03bb to the unit disk, |\u03bb| \u2264 1.\nWe apply the analytic deformation strategy, as we did\nfor the 1D case. We start from a Hamiltonian with known\nglobal analytic structure. For this we consider a separable potential,\nH0 = \u2212\u22072 + v\u22a5 (x, y) + v(z), v(z + b) = v(z),\n\n(63)\n\nand then adiabatically introduce the non-separable part\nof the Hamiltonian,\nH\u03b3 = H0 + \u03b3w(r), w(x, y, z + b) = w(x, y, z).\n\n(64)\n\nWe assume, for simplicity, that\nH\u22a5 \u2261 \u2212\u2202x2 \u2212 \u2202y2 + v\u22a5 (x, y)\n\n(65)\n\nhas only discrete, non-degenerate spectrum. For this, we\nwill have to constrain x and y in a finite region, which\ncan be arbitrarily large. To be specific, we assume x, y \u2208\n[0, b\u2032 ] and impose periodic boundary conditions. This\nis actually the most widely used approach in numerical\ncalculations involving linear chains. We also assume that\nw(r) has square integrable singularities, which warranties\nthat it is an analytic potential (see Appendix B).\nLet \u03c6j (x, y), Ej and \u03c8n,\u03bb (z), En (\u03bb) denote the eigenvectors and the corresponding eigenvalues of H\u22a5 and of\nHk\u03bb \u2261\n\n\u2212(\u2202z )2\u03bb\n\n+ v(z),\n\n(66)\n\nrespectively. Then the eigenvectors and the corresponding eigenvalues of H0 are given by:\n\u03a8jn,\u03bb (x, y, z) = \u03c6j (x, y)\u03c8n,\u03bb (z),\nEnj (\u03bb) = Ej + En (\u03bb).\n\nFIG. 8: a) Enj j (\u03bb) and Eni i (\u03bb) as a function of real kz\n(\u03bb = eikz b ) for case A.

The empty circles represent the\nbranch points and the arrow indicate how they connect different points of the Riemann surface.\n\n(67)\n\nThe global analytic structure of Enj (\u03bb) is known: for j\nfixed, they are different branches of a multi-valued analytic function E j (\u03bb), with a Riemann surface as in Fig. 4.\nWe now look for type II degeneracies:\nE = Ej + Enj (\u03bb) = Ei + Eni (\u03bb),\n\n(68)\n\nwhich can occur only for \u03bb on the unit circle or on the\nreal axis but away from the branch cuts. Indeed, if \u03bc(E)\ndenotes the Kramers function for the strictly one dimensional Hamiltonian Hk\u03bb ,19 then Eq. (68) is equivalent to\n\u03bc(E \u2212 Ej ) = \u03bc(E \u2212 Ei ).\n\n(69)\n\nIn Ref. 1, it was shown that the equation d\u03bc/dE = 0 has\nsolutions only for E on the real axis. Using exactly the\nsame arguments, one can show that all the solutions of\nEq. (69) are on the real axis (see Fig. 5).

For example, the solutions A and C in\nFig. 5 have \u03bb on the unit circle, while the solution B\nhas \u03bb on the real axis, inside the unit circle. We will\nrefer to this three situations as cases A, B and C. Since\nthe analytic structure is symmetric to \u03bb \u2192 \u03bb\u2217 , the type\nII degeneracies on the unit circle always come in pair,\nsymmetric to the real axis.\nWe consider first the case A, which corresponds to the\ncase when two bands intersect as in Fig. 6a. Fig. 6b\nshows the Riemann sheets corresponding to these two\nbands. There are two type II degeneracies, marked with\nsolid circles, on the unit circle and symmetric to the real\naxis. We assume for the beginning that these are the only\ntype II degeneracies that split when the non-separable\npotential is turned on. When the type II degeneracies\nsplit, avoided crossings occur and the bands split (see\nthe dashed lines in Fig. 6a). We denote the upper/lower\nband by E\u00b1 (\u03bb). When the non-separable part of the potential is turned on, the already existing branch points\nshift along the real axis. For small \u03b3, the shifts can be\ncalculated from Eq. (42). In addition, two type I degeneracies appear (and another two outside the unit disk),\nintroducing branch points that connect the original Riemann sheets. The connected sheets are shown in Fig. 6c,\nwhere we can also see that, when \u03bb makes a complete\nloop on the unit circle, we end up at the same point as\nwhere we started. This means we can re-cut the two,\nnow connected, sheets so that we stay on the same sheet\nwhen \u03bb moves on the unit circle. These new sheets are\nshown in Fig. 7 and correspond now to the upper/lower\nbands E\u00b1 (\u03bb).\nWe consider now the case C, which corresponds to a\nsituation when two bands intersect as in Fig. 8a. When\nthe type II degeneracies split, the bands split in E\u00b1 (\u03bb)\nand a gap appears. This is the only qualitative difference between cases A and C. The Riemann surfaces, before and after the non-separable potential was turned on,\n\nFIG. 10: a) The band Enj j (\u03bb) intersects with Eni i (\u03bb) and\nEnkk (\u03bb).

Again, we can re-cut the\nRiemann surface so one sheet corresponds to one band.\nThese new Riemann sheets are shown in Fig. 9.\nThe case B goes completely analogous. The qualitative\ndifferences are that the branch points split from the real\naxis and we don't have to re-cut the Riemann surface.\nWe analyze now a more involved possibility, namely\nwhen we have more type II degeneracies on the same\nRiemann sheet:\nEnj j (\u03bb) = Eni i (\u03bb), Enj j (\u03bb\u2032 ) = Enkk (\u03bb\u2032 ).\n\n(71)\n\nSuch a situation appears when, for example, we have\nbands crossing as in Fig. 10a. The Riemann sheets for\nthese bands and the type II degeneracies are shown in\nFig. 10b. When the perturbation is turned on, the type\nII degeneracies split in pairs of type I degeneracies, introducing branch points connecting the original sheets as\nshown in Fig. 10c. Again, when \u03bb completes one loop on\nthe unit circle, we end up at the same point of the Riemann surface as where we started. We can then re-cut\nthe Riemann surface such that we stay on the same sheet\nwhen \u03bb moves on the unit circle (see Fig. 11). The only\nnew element is a Riemann sheet (corresponding to the\nmiddle band) with 6 branch points.\n\n\f10\n\nOn\n\nOn\n\nOn\n\nj\n\n\u00101\n\ni\n\nk\n\nOn\n\nj\n\nOn\n\nk\n\n\u00101\n\nO n \u00101\ni\n\nFIG. 11: The Riemann sheets corresponding to the three\nbands (dashed lines) of Fig. 10a, for \u03b3 > 0.\n\nThe last situation we consider is the emergence of a\ncomplex band. Suppose that H has a symmetry with an\nirreducible representation of dimension 2. Suppose that\nthis symmetry is also present for the Bloch Hamiltonian\nat \u03bb = 1. In this case, the separable Hamiltonian will\nhave bands that touch like in Fig. 12a. Such situations\nare no longer accidental. In this case, the function G(\u03bb)\nintroduced in Eq. (12) behaves as\nG(\u03bb) = (\u03bb \u2212 1)4 g(\u03bb),\n\n(72)\n\nwith g(\u03bb) non-zero at \u03bb = 1. Following our previous notation, this will be a type IV degeneracy (see Fig. 12b).\nWhen the non-separable potential is turned on, the degeneracy at \u03bb = 1 cannot be lifted because of the symmetry. This means G(\u03bb) must continue to have a zero at\n\u03bb = 1. Generically, the order of this zero is reduced to 2\nand two other zero's split, symmetric relative to the unit\ncircle. In other words, the type IV degeneracy splits into\na pair of type I degeneracies plus a type II degeneracy.\nE(\u03bb) remains analytic at \u03bb = 0, but now the two bands\nare entangled, in the sense that we need to loop twice on\nthe unit circle to return back to the same point of the\nRiemann surface (see Fig. 12c) and we can no longer cut\nthe Riemann surface so that we stay on the same sheet\nwhen \u03bb moves on the unit circle. A complex band can\ninvolve an arbitrary number of bands. For example, the\nnew bands shown with dashed lines in Fig. 12a can entangle with other bands at \u03bb = \u22121, through the same\nmechanism, and so on. Rather than cutting the Riemann surface in individual sheets, we think it is much\nmore convenient to think of a complex band as living on\na surface made of all the individual sheets that are entangled through the mechanism described in Fig. 12. We\nnote that the complex band can split in simple bands as\nsoon as the symmetry is broken.\nWe can continue with further examples but we can already draw our main conclusions. The eigenvalues of\nH\u03bb,\u03b3 are different branches of a multi-valued analytic\nfunction E(\u03bb). The Riemann surface of E(\u03bb) can be cut\n\nin sub-surfaces, such that each sub-surface describes one\nband. For a simple band, this subsurface consists of the\nentire unit disk, with cuts obtained by connecting a finite number of branch points to the essential singularity\nat \u03bb = 0. For a complex band, the sub-surface consists\nof a finite number of unit disks that are connected as in\nFig. 12c. On this sub-surface we can have an arbitrary\nnumber of branch points, that connect this sub-surface\nto the rest of the Riemann surface. For both simple and\ncomplex bands, the branch points are symmetric relative\nto the real axis and, generically, they are of order 1 (\"accidental\" higher degeneracies can lead to branch points\nof higher order).\nAs we analytically deform the Hamiltonian, the unsplit type II degeneracies stay on the unit circle or real\naxis and the positions of the branch points shift smoothly.\nIn contradistinction to the 1D case, the branch points can\nmove from one sheet to another and their trajectories\ncan intersect. When two of them intersect, they either\nbecome branch points of order 2 or recombine into a type\nII degeneracy. Higher order branch points are not stable,\nin the sense that small perturbations split them into two\nor more branch points of order 1.\nThe Riemann surface of the spectral projector P\u03bb is\nthe same as for E(\u03bb). When the inversion symmetry is\npresent, the analytic structure of the Bloch functions can\nalso be completely determined from the analytic structure of E(\u03bb): the Riemann sheets of \u03c8\u03bb (x) are the same\nas for E(\u03bb), but the branch points are generically of order\n3 (see Eq. (36)).\n\nV.\n\nTHE GREEN'S FUNCTION\n\nWith the analytic structure at hand, it is a simple exercise to find a compact expression for the Green's function\nGE \u2261 (E \u2212 H)\u22121 , which is a generalization of the well\nknown Sturm-Liouville formula in 1D. Indeed, using the\neigenfunction expansion,\nXZ\n\u03c8n,1/\u03bb (r)\u03c8n,\u03bb (r\u2032 ) d\u03bb\n\u2032\nGE (r, r ) =\n,\n(73)\nE \u2212 En (\u03bb)\n2\u03c0i\u03bb\n|\u03bb|=1\nn\nwhere the sum goes over all unit disks of the Riemann\nsurface. Changing the variable from \u03bb to 1/\u03bb if necessary,\nthe above expression can also be written as:\nXZ\n\u03c8n,1/\u03bb (r< )\u03c8n,\u03bb (r> ) d\u03bb\nGE (r, r\u2032 ) =\n, (74)\nE \u2212 En (\u03bb)\n2\u03c0i\u03bb\n|\u03bb|=1\nn\nwhere r> = r if z > z \u2032 , r> = r\u2032 if z \u2032 > z, and similarly for r< . This step is necessary because we will\ndeform the contour of integration inside the unit circle.\nWe could deform the contour outside the unit circle, but\nsince we chose to exclude this part of the domain we\ndon't have this liberty anymore, and we need to re-arange\nthe arguments before deforming the contour. The integrand (including the summation over n) is analytic at\n\n\f11\nand un-occupied states. We start from\nZ\n1\n\u2032\nn(r, r ) =\nGE (r, r\u2032 )dE,\n2\u03c0i C\n\n(76)\n\nwhere C is a contour in the complex energy plane surrounding the energies of the occupied states. Using\nEq. (75), we readily obtain\nZ\n1\nn(r, r\u2032 ) =\n\u03c81/\u03bb (r< )\u03c8\u03bb (r> )\u03bb\u22121 d\u03bb,\n(77)\n2\u03c0i \u03b3\nwhere \u03b3 is the pre-image of the contour C on the Riemann\nsurface of E(\u03bb). We now restrict r and r\u2032 to the first unit\ncell and calculate the asymptotic form of n(r, r\u2032 + mbez )\nfor large m. Using the fundamental property of the Bloch\nfunctions, we have\nZ\n1\nn(r, r\u2032 + mbez ) =\n\u03c81/\u03bb (r< )\u03c8\u03bb (r> )\u03bbm\u22121 d\u03bb.

Then, apart from poles, which occur whenever\nEn (\u03bb) = E, the integrand is analytic. Using the residue\ntheorem, we conclude\nGE (r, r\u2032 ) =\n\nX \u03c81/\u03bbj (r< )\u03c8\u03bbj (r> )\nj\n\n\u03bbj \u2202\u03bb E(\u03bbj )\n\n,\n\n(75)\n\nwhere the sum goes over all \u03bbj on the Riemann surface\nsuch that E(\u03bbj ) = E. This expression is valid for systems with and without inversion symmetry, since it is the\nprojector, not the individual Bloch functions, that enters\ninto the above equations. Eq. (75) is closely related to the\nsurface adapted expression of the bulk Green's function\nderived in Ref. 20.\n\nVI.\n\nTHE DENSITY MATRIX\n\nAs a simple application, we derive the asymptotic behavior of the density matrix n(r, r\u2032 ) for large |z \u2212 z \u2032 |,\nwhen there is an insulating gap between the occupied\n\nWe deform the contour \u03b3 on the Riemann surface such\nthat the distance from its points to the unit circle is maximum. In this way, we enforced the fastest decay, with\nrespect to m, of the integrand. This optimal contour,\nwill surround (infinitely tide) the branch cuts enclosed\nby the original contour. The asymptotic behavior comes\nfrom the vicinity of the branch points \u03bbc and \u03bb\u2217c (they\nalways come in pair) that are the closest to the unit circle. Using the behavior of the Bloch functions near the\nbranch points, we find\nZ\n(\u03bb/\u03bbc )m\u22121 d(\u03bb/\u03bbc )\nn \u2192 Re c\u0304(r)c(r\u2032 )\u03bbm\n,\n(79)\nc\n\u03c0(1 \u2212 \u03bb/\u03bbc )1/2\nwhere the integral is taken along the branch cut of \u03bbc .\nThis integral is equal to \u03c02 B(m, 1/2), with B the Beta\nfunction. We conclude:\nn(r, r\u2032 + mbez ) \u2192\n\n1\nB(m, 1/2)Re[c\u0304(r)c(r\u2032 )\u03bbm\nc ].\n\u03c0\n\n(80)\n\nAgain, this expression holds for systems with and without inversion symmetry, since it is the projector, not the\nindividual Bloch functions, that enters in the above equations.\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nFirst, we want to point out that the formalism presented here can be also applied to cubic crystals, to derive the analytic structure of the Bloch functions with\nrespect to kz , while keeping kx and ky fixed. Preliminary results and several applications have been already\nreported in Ref. 21.\nWe come now to the question of how to locate the\nbranch points for a real system. In a straightforward approach, one will have to locate those \u03bb inside the unit\ndisk where H\u03bb displays degeneracies. Although such a\n\n\f12\nprogram can be, at least in principle, carried out numerically, there are few chances of success without clues\nof where these points are located. This is because, in\nmore than one dimension, these degeneracies occur, in\ngeneral, at complex energies. One possible solution is to\nfollow the lines presented in this paper: locate the type II\ndegeneracies for a separable potential vs , chosen as close\nto the real potential v as possible, and follow the trajectory of the branch points as the potential is adiabatically\nchanged v\u03b3 = vs + \u03b3(v \u2212 vs ), from \u03b3 = 0 to 1. We plan\nto complete such a program in the near future.\nThe analytic structure of the band energies and Bloch\nfunctions of 3D crystals, viewed as functions of several\nvariables kx , ky and kz is a much more complex problem,\nwith qualitatively new aspects. It will be interesting to\nsee if this problem can be tackled by the same analytic\ndeformation technique.\nThe main part of this work was completed while\nthe author was visiting Department of Physics at UC\nSanta Barbara.

As we did in the main text, we constrain x and y in finite intervals. The Bloch functions are\ndetermined by the following Hamiltonian:\nH\u03bb,\u03b3 = \u2212\u2206\u03bb + \u03b3w, x, y \u2208 [0, b\u2032 ] and z \u2208 [0, b],\n\n(B1)\n\nwhere \u2206\u03bb is the Laplace operator with periodic boundaries in x and y and the usual Bloch conditions in z.

For this we\nneed the following technical result.\nProposition. Suppose w satisfies Eq. (B2). Then, for a\npositive and sufficiently large, there exists a positive \u01eba\nsuch that lim \u01eba = 0 and:\na\u2192\u221e\n\nkwf kL2 \u2264 \u01eba k(H\u03bb,0 + a)f kL2 ,\nfor any f in the domain of H\u03bb,0 .\n\n(B3)\n\n\f13\nNow, pick an arbitrary \u03b30 , let z \u2208 \u03c1(H\u03bb,\u03b30 ) and denote dz = k(H\u03bb,\u03b30 \u2212 z)\u22121 k < \u221e, where k k denotes the\noperator norm. Since\n(1 \u2212 \u01eba |\u03b30 |)kwf kL2 \u2264 \u01eba k(H\u03bb,\u03b30 + a)f kL2 ,\n\n(B4)\n\nfor any f in the domain of H\u03bb,0 , taking a sufficiently large\nso that 1 \u2212 \u01eba |\u03b30 | > 0, we obtain:\nkw(H\u03bb,\u03b30 \u2212 z)\u22121 k \u2264\n\n\u01eba [1 + |z + a|dz ]\n< \u221e.\n1 \u2212 \u01eba |\u03b30 |\n\n(B5)\n\nwith the aid of Eq. (B8), we obtain:\nkwf kL2 \u2264 \u03b1a kwkL2 k(H\u03bb,0 + a)f kL2 ,\n\ni.e. Eq. (B3), if we identify \u01eba \u2261 \u03b1a kwkL2 . We remark\nthat \u03b1a defined in Eq. (B9) is optimal, in the sense that\nthere are f \u2032 s when we do have equality in Eq. (B10). It\nremains to show that lima\u2192\u221e \u03b1a = 0.\nIf G0 = (\u2212\u2206 + a)\u22121 , with \u2206 the Laplace operator over\nthe entire R3 , then we have the following representation:\n\nIf M denotes the right hand side of the above equation,\nthen (H\u03bb,\u03b3 \u2212 z)\u22121 is bounded for |\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b30 | < M \u22121 and has\nthe following norm convergent expansion:\n(H\u03bb,\u03b3 \u2212 z)\u22121 = (H\u03bb,\u03b30 \u2212 z)\u22121\n\u221e\nX\n\u00d7\n(\u03b30 \u2212 \u03b3)n [w(H\u03bb,\u03b30 \u2212 z)\u22121 ]n .\n\n(B6)\n\nn=0\n\nThus, (H\u03bb,\u03b3 \u2212 z)\u22121 is analytic at the arbitrarily chosen\n\u03b30 .\nWe now give the proof of the proposition. For f in the\ndomain of H\u03bb,0 , let g = (H\u03bb,0 +a)f . If G\u03bb = (H\u03bb,0 +a)\u22121 ,\nwith a assumed sufficiently large so that (H\u03bb,0 + a)\u22121\nexists, we have\nZ\nf (r) = G\u03bb (r, r\u2032 ; a)g(r\u2032 )dr\u2032\n(B7)\nand Schwartz inequality gives (kf kL\u221e \u2261 sup |f (r)|)\nr\n\nkf kL\u221e \u2264 sup\nr\n\n\u0014Z\n\n|G\u03bb (r, r\u2032 ; a)|2 dr\u2032\n\n\u00151/2\n\nkgkL2 .\n\nG\u03bb (r, r\u2032 ; a) =\n\n\u03b1a = sup\nr\n\n\u2217\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n5\n6\n\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n\n12\n\n\u2032\n\n2\n\n\u2032\n\n|G\u03bb (r, r ; a)| dr\n\n\u00151/2\n\n,\n\nElectronic address: eprodan@princeton.edu\nW.
