Kontsevich's formula for a deformation quantization of Poisson\nstructures involves a Feynman series of graphs, with the weights given by some\ncomplicated integrals (using certain pullbacks of the standard angle form on\na circle). We explain the geometric meaning of this series as degrees of maps\nof some grand configuration spaces; the associativity proof is also interpreted\nin purely homological terms. An interpretation in terms of degrees of maps\nshows that any other 1-form on the circle also leads to a \u2217-product and allows\none to compare these products.\n\n1. Introduction\n1.1. Kontsevich's quantization. Recently, Kontsevich [4] provided a deformation quantization of the algebra of functions on an arbitrary Poisson manifold. The\nkey ingredient of his construction is the quantization formula for Rd , which is then\nextended to the case of general manifolds using formal geometry. The terms of\nthe star product are identified with certain Feynman graphs, and their coefficients\n(\"weights\") are given by some complicated integrals (involving certain pullbacks of\nthe standard volume form on a torus over the corresponding configuration spaces).\nThe first non-trivial case of Kontsevich's construction is for a linear Poisson\nbrackets, i.e. Poisson structures on a dual of a Lie algebra. In this paper we\nconsider only this case (see Section 1.3 for a discussion).\nRemoval of the two external vertices splits any graph appearing in the definition\nof the star product into several connected components. The weight of a graph\nis the product of weights of its connected components. In a linear case each of\nthem may have at most one cycle, which should consist of oriented edges. It turns\nout that one may restrict the class of graphs in Kontsevich's construction to trees,\nexcluding graphs with a non-trivial first homology. The weights of these tree graphs\ncoincide with the coefficients of the usual Gutt's star product [2] arising from the\nCampbell-Baker-Hausdorff formula [3]. Thus Kontsevich's quantization differs from\nthe CBH-formula essentially only by the contributions of graphs with one cycle, in\nparticular of the so-called \"wheels\" (see Section 4.6).\n1.2. Main results and the organization of the paper. An important problem\nrelated to Kontsevich's construction for Rd is to interpret geometrically, and show\na way to compute, the weights of graphs. In some partial cases such computations\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary: 53D55; Secondary: 55R80, 57R35.\nKey words and phrases. Deformation quantization, Poisson structures, Feynman graphs, configuration spaces, compactification.\nPartially supported by the Israeli Science Foundation grant 86/01 and the Technion grant for\npromotion of research.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nMICHAEL POLYAK\n\nwere done in [3]. However, these direct computations are complicated and not\nilluminating. One of the reasons for a lack of a geometrical interpretation of these\nintegrals seems to be that some special properties of the standard angle form on S 1\nare significantly involved in Kontsevich's proofs. Thus two natural questions are\nwhether other 1-forms on S 1 also lead to an associative star product, and if yes,\nhow do these products depend on the choice of a form. We answer both questions\nin the linear case.\nFirst we show than any 1-form on S 1 gives an associative star product. This\nis done by an interpretation of the associativity as a vanishing of some cocycle\nin the relative top cohomology of a grand configuration space Cn,3 . These spaces\nare obtained by gluing together the configuration spaces corresponding to graphs\nalong their boundary strata. These boundary strata are of two types: principal and\nhidden. The gluings along the principal strata are done according to the Jacobi\nrelation. Hidden strata are zipped-up, i.e. glued to itself by some involutions. By\nchoosing singular forms concentrated in one point on a torus, one gets star products\nwith rational coefficients (with a straightforward estimate on the denominators).\nThese coefficients can be computed by a simple combinatorial count.\nWe then turn to a problem of comparison of these star products. This is done in\na similar fashion, by identifying terms in these star products with some fixed top\ncohomology class of a similar grand configuration space Cn,2 . This identification\ninvolves, however, a capping of some additional- external- boundary strata by the\nconfiguration spaces of the wheels. Thus products for different differential forms on\nS 1 may differ only by the weights of the wheels. We show that the tree (i.e. 0-loop)\npart of all star products coincide and are equal to Gutt's star product. We also\nshow that any differential form supported on a semi-circle leads to Gutt's product.\n\n1.3. Related problems. The point of view of this paper was heavily motivated\nby a similar interpretation of the Feynman series appearing in the perturbative\nChern-Simons theory and used to produce a universal invariants of knots and 3manifolds, see e.g. [1, 6, 7]. The construction of the star product considered in this\nnote is quite similar (in particular, it is interesting that a similar antisymmetry and\nJacobi relations appear in the gluing construction), although there are of course\nfew differences (in the Chern-Simons theory the edges are not oriented, all vertices\nare trivalent- which implies a simple involution argument showing the vanishing of\nthe hidden strata- and the spaces after gluing are closed). There is a clear common\ndenominator in these constructions; in fact, this note was initiated as a check that\nthe same technique may be applied. I believe that this technique of producing grand\nconfiguration spaces by gluings is quite powerful; it would be quite interesting to\nfind some other applications.\nWhile I strongly believe that the approach used in this paper can be applied for\ngeneral Poisson structures, the zip-up argument of Section 3.5 for hidden faces then\nworks only up to degree six, so a new argument is needed to prove a conjecture about\nvanishing of the weights of the hidden strata. When this paper was already finished,\nthe author found a modification of this construction which works for quadratic\nPoisson structures (to be discussed in a forthcoming paper). The general case,\nhowever, still remains open.\n\n\fQUANTIZATION OF LINEAR POISSON STRUCTURES AND DEGREES OF MAPS\n\n3\n\n2. Graphs and differential operators\n2.1. Admissible graphs. Througout the paper we will deal with graphs G such\nthat\n\u2022 the edges of G are oriented;\n\u2022 the set of vertices of G is subdivided into two disjoint subsets: the internal\nvertices V i and the external vertices V e ;\n\u2022 the set of external vertices is ordered;\n\u2022 G does not contain double or looped edges.\nAn orientation of G is an ordering of outgoing edges in each vertex, up to a negation\nin any two vertices. Following Kontsevich [4], we will call an oriented graph G\nadmissible if\n\u2022 exactly two edges start in each internal vertex, and no edges start in any\nexternal vertex.\nSince we will deal primarily with the linear case, i.e. the Poisson brackets on a dual\nof a Lie algebra, we define a Lie-admissible graph as an (oriented) admissible graph\nsuch that\n\u2022 in each internal vertex there ends at most one edge.\nNote that this condition implies that each connected component of a graph\nobtained from G by a removal of all external vertices is either a tree, or contains\none cycle, which consists of oriented edges.\nDenote by Gn,m the set of all Lie-admissible graphs with n internal and m external vertices. For example, G0,2 is generated by the graph with two (external)\nvertices and no edges. The \"wedge\" graph with one internal vertex connected to\ntwo external vertices by a pair of edges (see the graph G\u2032 of Figure 1), gives two\ngenerators of G1,2 , which differ by the ordering of the edges. Denote Gm = \u2210n Gn,m .\nNote that the orientation of a graph with a set E of edges induces an orientation of R|E| = R2 \u00d7 ...R2 as in [4]: choose an arbitrary ordering of all internal\nvertices and then take ordered pairs of edges starting at 1-st, 2-nd, etc., vertex. For\ntechnical reasons (namely, the Jacobi relation (3) for labelled graphs) we will often\nneed to consider more general orderings of E. A labelled graph is an admissible\ngraph endowed with an arbitrary ordering of its edges, compatible with the above\norientation of R|E| .\nRemark 2.1. Note that our labellings are more general than in [4]: we consider\nall orderings of edges, so for a non-oriented graph with n internal vertices and no\nnontrivial automorphisms the number of labellings is (2n)!. Picking an orientation\nof G cuts this number in half. In general we should also take into account the\nnumber of automorphisms of G (preserving the order of external vertices), so the\nnumber of different labellings of an oriented graph is | Aut G|\u22121 (2n)!/2.\nDenote by Gen,m the set of all labelled Lie-admissible graphs with n internal and\nm external vertices, and set Gm = \u2210n Gn,m . There is an obvious forgetful map\nGen,m \u2192 Gn,m ; abusing notation, we will denote the image of G also by G.\n\n2.2. Product and composition of graphs. There are several important operations on graphs.\nFirstly, there is a product Gn,m \u00d7 Gn\u2032 ,m \u2192 Gn+n\u2032 ,m : we define G * G\u2032 to be the\ngraph obtained by juxtaposition of G and G\u2032 , followed by the identification of their\n\n\f4\n\nMICHAEL POLYAK\n\nexternal vertices. See Figure 1a. This makes Gm into a semigroup. In particular, G1\nis generated by n-spiked \"wheels\", i.e. by graphs with n interior vertices forming\nan oriented cycle of edges and connected to the exterior vertex by n spikes, see\nFigure 9a.\nSecondly, there is a composition \u25e6i : Gn,m \u00d7Gn\u2032 ,m\u2032 \u2192 Gn+n\u2032 ,m+m\u2032 \u22121 , i = 1, . . . , m\nof two admissible graphs G \u2208 Gn,m , G\u2032 \u2208 Gn\u2032 ,m\u2032 defined by inserting G\u2032 in i-th\nexternal vertex of G. This insertion is done in the following way. Cut out a small\ndisc surrounding the i-th external vertex vi of G and place there a small copy of\nG\u2032 . Now, sum over all possible ways of attaching the incoming edges of vi to the\nvertices of G\u2032 , which result in a Lie-admissible graph. See Figure 1b. The external\nvertices of G \u25e6i G\u2032 are ordered in a natural way: {1, . . . , i \u2212 1, 1\u2032 , . . . , m\u2032 , i + 1, m}.\n+\na\n\nG\n\nG\n\n+\n\nb\n\nFigure 1. A product G * G\u2032 and a composition G \u25e62 G\u2032 of graphs\nWe may combine all \u25e6i 's into one composition on the vector space QG over Q\nspanned by G:\nG \u25e6 G\u2032 =\n\n(1)\n\nm\nX\ni=1\n\n(\u22121)i G \u25e6i G\u2032 .\n\nWhile non-associative, this operation defines a pre-Lie structure on QG, i.e., for\nany x, y, z \u2208 G we have x \u25e6 (y \u25e6 z) \u2212 (x \u25e6 y) \u25e6 z = x \u25e6 (z \u25e6 y) \u2212 (x \u25e6 z) \u25e6 y. Hence the\nbracket [G, G\u2032 ] = G \u25e6 G\u2032 \u2212 G\u2032 \u25e6 G defines a Lie algebra structure on\nP QG.\nIn a similar way, one may define a co-product on QG by \u2206G = G\u2032 \u2282G (G/G\u2032 ) \u2297\nG\u2032 , where the summation is over all Lie-admissible subgraphs G\u2032 of G s.t. the\nquotient graph G/G\u2032 (obtained by shrinking G\u2032 into a point) is also Lie-admissible.\nAll above operations may be also defined on labelled graphs in an obvious way.\n2.3. Differential operators assigned to graphs. Let \u03b1 be a bi-vector field on\nan open\nU in Rd . In the coordinates xi , i = 1, 2, . . . , d on Rd it is given by\nP domain\n\u2202\nij\n\u03b1 = i,j \u03b1 (x)\u2202i \u2227 \u2202j , where \u2202i = \u2202x\ni . To each admissible graph G \u2208 Gn,m we\nassign a polydifferential operator BG : (C \u221e (U))\u00d7m \u2192 C \u221e (U) as in [4]. Namely,\nput \u03b1i(v)j(v) at each internal vertex v of G and put the corresponding derivatives\n\u2202i(v) and \u2202j(v) at two edges starting at v. Thus we have a derivative \u2202e assigned\nto each edge of G, and a tensor \u03b1ij at each internal vertex. We will call such\nan assignment a state of G. Finally, put a function fi at i-th external vertex,\ni = 1, . . . , m. The operator BG is defined by the following formula:\n\nBG,\u03b1 (f1 , . . . , fm ) =\n\nX\n\nstates\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\nY\n\n(\n\nY\n\nv\u2208V i e\u2208E(v)\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u2202e )\u03b1i(v)j(v) \uf8f8 \u00d7 \uf8ed\n\nY\n\n(\n\nY\n\nv\u2208V e e\u2208E(v)\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u2202e )fv \uf8f8 ,\n\n\fQUANTIZATION OF LINEAR POISSON STRUCTURES AND DEGREES OF MAPS\n\n5\n\nwhere E(v) denotes the set of incoming edges of a vertex v. For example, for the\ngraph G in the left hand side of Figure 1 we have\nX\nBG (f, g) =\n\u03b1ij \u2202j (\u03b1kl )\u2202i \u2202k (f )\u2202l (g).\ni,j,k,l\n\nIf \u03b1 is linear, its second derivatives vanish, so BG = 0 for any graph G which\ncontains a vertex with at least two incoming edges. Thus in the linear case it suffices\nto consider only Lie-admissible graphs.\n2.4. Antisymmetry and Jacobi relations on graphs. We put G = \u2212G\u2032 if two\nadmissible graphs G, G\u2032 differ only by the ordering of two edges starting in some\ninternal vertex. Here is a graphical version of this antisymmetry relation (AS):\n=\u2212\n\n(2)\n\nHere and further on, in figures at each internal vertex we use the ordering of two\noutgoing edges induced by the orientation of the plane, unless specified otherwise.\nWe impose the following Jacobi relation on admissible graphs:\n(3)\n\nX\n\n(\n\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n)=0\n\nIn the relations above all graphs are assumed to coincide outside the small disk\nshown in the figure. There may be some incoming edges entering the disk; the\nsummation in the Jacobi relation is over all possible ways to connect these incoming\nedges to two depicted vertices. E.g., if there are two incoming edges, four different\nways to connect these edges to two depicted vertices will give 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 terms in\nthe Jacobi relation. For Lie-admissible graphs the situation is simpler: there may\nbe at most one incoming edge and the unique way to connect it, so we have\n\n(4)\n\nX\n\n(\n\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n)=0\n\nThere are also obvious \"labelled\" versions of these relations for graphs in Gen,m .\nDenote by Jn,m the vector space over Q generated by graphs in Gn,m modulo the\nAS and Jacobi relations, and set Jm = \u2295n Jn,m . For G \u2208 Gn,m denote by [G] its\nimage in Jn,m (we will also use [G] for the image of G \u2208 Gen,m under the composition\nof the forgetful map and the above quotient map).\nLemma 2.2. Each composition \u25e6i of graphs factors through relations (2), (3), thus\ndefines a quotient map \u25e6i : Jn,m \u00d7 Jn\u2032 ,m\u2032 \u2192 Jn+n\u2032 ,m+m\u2032 \u22121\n\nProof. Define [G] \u25e6i [G\u2032 ] = [G \u25e6i G\u2032 ] for any graphs G \u2208 Gn,m and G\u2032 \u2208 Gn\u2032 ,m\u2032\nrepresenting the equivalence classes [G] and [G\u2032 ] and extend it by linearity. The\nfact that [\u0393 \u25e6i G\u2032 ] = 0 for any linear combination \u0393 such that [\u0393] = 0 is immediate.\nIt is also obvious that [G \u25e6 (G\u2032 \u2212 G\u2032\u2032 )] = 0 when G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032 differ by the ordering\nof two outgoing edges in one vertex. The only check which may cause a moment\nthought is that [G \u25e6i \u0393\u2032 ] = 0 where \u0393\u2032 is a linear combination of graphs appearing in\n\n\f6\n\nMICHAEL POLYAK\n\nthe left hand side of equation (3). This, however, readily follows from the fact that\nin the definition of \u25e6i we sum over all possible attachments of the incoming edges\nof i-th external vertex of G to vertices of \u0393\u2032 , in particular to the vertices appearing\nin equation (3)).\n\u0003\nThe reason to call (2) and (3) \"antisymmetry and Jacobi relations\" is quite\nsimple:\nLemma 2.3. Let \u03b1 be a Poisson bi-vector field. Then the map B : G 7\u2192 BG factors\nthrough relations (2), (3), thus defines a quotient map B of Jm to polydifferential\noperators.\nProof. Clearly, (2) is the graphical version of the antisymmetry relation for \u03b1.\nEquation (3) with no incoming edges is exactly a graphical version of the Jacobi\nidentity for \u03b1. Similarly, (3) with several incoming edges corresponds to taking\nhigher derivatives of the Jacobi identity.\n\u0003\n3. Configuration spaces and their maps\n3.1. Configuration spaces CG (H) and CG (R2 ). Consider the standard upper\nhalf-plane H = {z \u2208 C|I(z) > 0} as the hyperbolic plane with the Lobachevsky\nmetric, and the real line R = {z \u2208 C|I(z) = 0} (together with the point \u221e) as the\nabsolute. Denote by H the compactified space H \u222a R.\nFor a (either labelled or not) graph G with |V i | = n internal and |V e | = m\neG (H) be the space of embeddings f : V i \u222a V e \u2192 H of the\nexternal vertices, let C\nvertex set of G, such that f (V i ) \u2282 H, and f (V e ) \u2282 R preserving the order of\neG (H) \u223c\nV e . Thus we have C\n= Hn \u00d7 Rm r \u2206, where \u2206 is the union of all diagonals.\nTwo-dimensional group T h(H) = {z \u2192 az + b|a \u2208 R+ , b \u2208 R} of translations and\neG (H). Let CG (H) be the quotient space C\neG /T h(H).\nhomotheties of H acts on C\nn\nm\nSince both H \u00d7 R and T h(H) are orientable, so is CG (H). This orientation does\nnot depend on the ordering of internal vertices of G: if an ordering of two internal\nvertices is permuted, it leads to a permutation of two copies of H in Hn , so does\nnot change its orientation. Further we will use the notation CG for CG (H) when\nG has some external vertices, i.e. m > 0.\nFor a graph G with no external vertices one may consider also a simpler configueG (R2 ) \u223c\nration space: let C\n= (R2 )n r \u2206 be the space of all embeddings of the vertex\n2\neG (R2 )/T h(R2 ) modulo the action of\nset of G in R . Let CG (R2 ) be the quotient C\n2\na 3-dimensional group T h(R ) = {z \u2192 az + b|a \u2208 R+ , b \u2208 C} of translations and\nhomotheties of R2 . Since for m = 0 we will mostly deal with CG (R2 ) and not with\nCG (H), in this case we shall use the notation CG = CG (R2 ).\n3.2. Configurations of pairs of points. Let us describe in more details (see also\n[4]) the configuration space C = Ce (H) of a graph G = e with two internal vertices\nconnected\n\u221a by one edge. Acting by T h(H), we may always move\n\u221a the outgoing vertex\nv1 to \u22121 = (0, 1); the incoming vertex v2 then lies on H r \u22121. Let\n\u221a us describe\na compactification C of C. To compactify C when\nv\napproaches\n\u22121, we pick\n2\n\u221a\nsome 0 < r << 1 and cut out an open disc |z \u2212 \u22121| < r, its boundary circle s\nencoding the direction in which v2 approaches v1 . To compactify C at infinity, we\npick R >> 1 and cut out the set |z| > R, its boundary semicircle S encoding the\ndirection in which the second point approaches infinity. Finally, to compactify C\nwhen v2 approaches R, we add an interval I = {z \u2208 C| \u2212 R < R(z) \u2264 R, I(z) = 0}.\n\n\fQUANTIZATION OF LINEAR POISSON STRUCTURES AND DEGREES OF MAPS\n\n7\n\nSee Figure 2. Notice also, that the space Ce (R2 ) \u223c\n= S 1 , and may be identified with\n2\n\u221a\nthe circle s after an identification of R with T \u22121 H.\nS\ns\nI\n\nFigure 2. Compactified configuration space of pairs\nSuppose now that one of the vertices of a one-edge graph is external. The\ncorresponding configuration space is an interval; in the model above it may be\nidentified either with the semicircle S (if v1 is external) or with the interval I (if\nv2 is external). Finally, suppose that both vertices are external. In this case the\nspace Ce (H) is a point and may be identified in the model above with one of the\nendpoints of the interval I, depending on the direction of the edge (or, equivalently,\nwith the endpoints of the semicircle S).\nThus various boundary strata of C actually correspond to all possible configuration spaces of pairs of points.\n\n8\n\n3.3. Angle maps. The space C has the homotopy type of S 1 . We will call a map\na : C \u2192 S 1 an angle map, if it is identity on s, maps the whole of S to 0, and\nmaps I onto S 1 surgectively. An angle map used in [4] is defined as follows. Let\n2\n(p, q) \u2208 H be a pair of points. Compute the angle between the direction from p to\n\u221e and the direction from p to q in the hyperbolic geometry on H (see Figure 3a).\nA simple check shows that this map is T h(H)-invariant and indeed determines an\nangle map.\n\na\n\nq\n\nq\np\n\na\n\nb\n\na\n\np\n\np\n\nFigure 3. Angle maps\nHere is another simple example of an angle map: for (p, q) as above, take the\nangle between the direction from q to p\u0304 and from q to p in the Euclidean geometry\non C (see Figure 3b).\nWe will fix some angle map a for the remaining part of the paper.\n3.4. Gauss maps and compactifications of configuration spaces. For an\nedge e of a labelled graph G, an evaluation map eve : CG \u2192 C is obtained by\nforgetting all vertices of G except for the ends of e. A Gauss map \u03c6e : CG \u2192 S 1\nis a composition of eve with the angle map a. Taking the map \u03c6e for each edge\neQ1 , . . . , ek and using the ordering of edges, we get the product Gauss map \u03a6G =\nk\ne \u03c6e : CG \u2192 T . We shall construct compactification C G of CG so that \u03a6G\n\n\f8\n\nMICHAEL POLYAK\n\nwill extend to C G . The minimal construction is to take the closure of the graph\nof \u03c6G in (Hn \u00d7 Rm ) \u00d7 Tk ; unfortunately it is rather hard to describe explicitly.\nAnother extreme (\"overblown\") solution is to blow up all diagonals of Hn \u00d7 Rm ;\nthis compactification was used in [4]. The map \u03a6G obviously extends to any of the\nabove compactifications.\nFollowing [6], we will consider an intermediate solution: to blow up only the\ndiagonals of Hn \u00d7 Rm corresponding to subgraphs of G which are 2-connected\n(this is somewhat smaller than in [7], where blow ups were done for all connected\nsubgraphs). Here a graph is 2-connected (or rather vertex-2-connected), if it remains\nconnected after a removal of any one of its vertices. In particular an edge is 2connected. The resulting space C G is a manifold with corners. The boundary\nstrata look as follows. Each codimension one face of C G corresponds to a collision\nof all vertices of a vertex-one-connected subgraph \u0393 of G. Both the face and the\nrestriction of the Gauss map to it have a product structure \u03a6G/\u0393 \u00d7\u03a6\u0393 : CG/\u0393 \u00d7C\u0393 \u2192\nTl\u2212k \u00d7 Tk , where l and k is the number of edges of G and \u0393 respectively. Here the\nsecond factor encodes the way the vertices of \u0393 approach each other, seen through\na \"magnifying glass\" (called a screen by Fulton and MacPherson). More generally,\na stratum of codimension k corresponds to a collection of k vertex-one-connected\nsubgraphs \u0393i of G, each two of which are either nested (i.e. contained in one\nanother) or disjoint. Such a stratum is adjacent to all strata of codimension k \u2212 1\nobtained by removing one of \u0393i 's from the collection.\n3.5. Constructing the grand configuration space. Consider the disjoint union\nen,m \u2192\nen,m = \u2210 e C G of configuration spaces and the map \u03a6n,m = \u2210G \u03a6G : C\nC\nG\u2208Gn,m\n\nen,m has no top degree cohomology since each component C G has\nT2n . The space C\nen,m by all means: gluing them together,\nfaces. We want to get rid of the faces of C\ncapping-off, or relativizing, to obtain a space Cn,m with a much smaller boundary,\nbut still with a well-defined map \u03a6n,m : Cn,m \u2192 T2n .\nSome boundary strata are easy to take care of; namely, we shall not care for any\nstrata which are\nen,m , or\n\u2022 of codimension two or more in C\n2n\n\u2022 mapped to T with a loss of dimension (i.e. the difference between the\ndimensions of the source and the image) two or more, or\n\u2022 mapped to the union O of all coordinate hyperspaces {\u03a6i = 0} \u2282 T2n .\nWe will simply relativize these strata including them in a singular locus Dn,m\nand considering then \u03a6n,m : (Cn,m , Dn,m ) \u2192 (T2n , O). Let us describe the gluen,m .\ning/relativizing process for various types of boundary faces of C\nFirstly, there are the principal internal faces, where two internal vertices of a\ngraph G connected by one edge e collide together. Note that the same principal\nface CG/e \u00d7 S 1 appears in each of the three graphs related by the Jacobi relation,\nas shown in Figure 4, where the colliding vertices are indicated by a dashed circle\n(and a possible incoming edge is also dashed). Thus we can glue these faces of three\ngraphs of Figure 4 together.\nSecondly, there are the hidden internal faces CG/\u0393 \u00d7 C\u0393 , where several internal\nvertices of a connected subgraph \u0393 of G (with more than one edge) collide together.\nA simple dimension counting shows that unless the number of edges starting in \u0393\nand ending in G r \u0393 is two or three, the loss of dimension under the map is at\nleast two on one of the two factors, so the face is readily relativized. Also, unless\n\n\fQUANTIZATION OF LINEAR POISSON STRUCTURES AND DEGREES OF MAPS\n\nG e\n\n9\n\ne\n\nFigure 4. Gluing principal faces together\n\u0393 is 2-connected, C\u0393 loses at least one dimension under \u03a6G (since the dilatations\nof one of the parts into which a cut-vertex splits \u0393 preserve \u03a6G ), so such a face\ncan again be relativized. The remaining hidden faces1 have an orientation reversing\ninvolution which preserves \u03a6G , thus can be zipped-up (i.e. glued to itself by this\ninvolution) following an idea of [5]. Indeed, pick a vertex v in \u0393 with an edge ending\nin Gr \u0393. Any vertex of a Lie-admissible graph has valence at most three; moreover,\n\u0393 is 2-connected, thus any vertex v \u2208 \u0393 with an edge ending in G r \u0393 has precisely\ntwo edges e1 = (v1 , v) and e2 = (v, v2 ) with v1 , v2 \u2208 \u0393. The involution of v w.r.t.\nthe middle of the interval connecting v1 and v2 (i.e. v \u2192 v1 + v2 \u2212 v, if we think\nabout v, v1 and v2 as points in R2 ), followed by the reordering of e1 and e2 reverses\nthe orientation of this boundary face, but preserves \u03a6G .\nThirdly, there are the infinity faces, where some internal vertices of a connected\nsubgraph \u0393 of G approach the absolute line R, but remain distant from the external\nvertices. Then any edge starting in \u0393 and ending in G r \u0393 is mapped to 0, thus\nsuch faces can again be relativized.\nFinally, there are the external faces, where the vertices of a connected subgraph\n\u0393 of G which collide together contain k > 0 external vertices. Again, if there is an\nedge starting in \u0393 and ending in G r \u0393, it is mapped to 0, thus such faces can be\nrelativized. In the remaining cases the situation depends on k. If k > 2 or k = 1,\nthen the map \u03a6G/\u0393 or \u03a6\u0393 respectively has a loss of at least two dimensions, so\nagain can be relativized. We are left, however, with the case k = 2. We can still\nget rid of at least some of these faces. Namely, if the graph G/\u0393 has a double edge\ne1 = e2 , we zip up a pair of faces corresponding to (a collapse of a subgraph \u0393 of)\ntwo graphs G and G\u2217 which differ only by the ordering of e1 and e2 . Indeed, the\nmaps \u03a6G and \u03a6G\u2217 differ only by a transposition of two factors of S 1 in T2n , so\ncoincide up to a sign on the diagonal e1 = e2 .\nTo sum it up: the only boundary faces of Cn,m (which are not included in the\nsingular locus Dn,m ) are the external faces, corresponding to subgraphs \u0393 \u2208 Gk,2 of\na graph G \u2208 Gn,m which contain exactly two external and any number k of internal\nvertices, all edges starting in \u0393 also end there, and G/\u0393 does not have double edges.\nIn other words,\nProposition 3.1. [cf. Kontsevich [4]] The boundary faces of Cn,m restricted to\nC G correspond to pairs \u0393\u2032 \u2208 Gen\u2212k,m\u22121 and \u0393\u2032\u2032 \u2208 Gek,2 such that G = \u0393\u2032 \u25e6i \u0393\u2032\u2032 for\nsome i. The restriction of \u03a6n,m to such a face is\n(5)\n\n\u03a6n\u2212k,m\u22121 \u00d7 \u03a6k,2 : C\u0393\u2032 \u00d7 C\u0393\u2032\u2032 \u2192 T2(n\u2212k) \u00d7 T2k\n\nWe will use this crucial fact in Section 3.10 below, and then again in Section 4.3.\n1This is actually the only place where we have to use Lie-admissibility of the initial graph, and\nthus the linearity of the Poisson structure\n\n\f10\n\nMICHAEL POLYAK\n\n3.6. Example: wedge graphs. There are two \"wedge\" graphs G in G1,2 which\ndiffer only by the ordering of the edges; denote by G the one with the natural order\nof the edges, and by G\u2217 the other. To visualize the space CG , it is convenient to fix\ntwo external vertices in 0, 1 \u2208 R by the action of T h(H). The remaining internal\nvertex is free to run in the complement of these two points in H, or, equivalently,\nin the complement of 0, 1, \u221e on H, so CG \u223c\n= H r {0, 1, \u221e}. The compactification\nC G is shown on Figure 5.\nS\n\n\u03c61\n\u03c62\ns0\n\nD1\n\n\u03c62\nD2\np\n\n\u03a6\n\nD3\np\n\ns0\n\nS\n\nT2\n\ns1\nD2\n\ns1\n\nD3\n\nD1\n\n\u03c61\n\nFigure 5. Compactified space of the wedge graph and its map to T2\nThe small semi-circles s0 , s1 around 0, 1 correspond to the faces where the\ninternal vertex approaches one of the external vertices; \u03a6G (s0 ) = S 1 \u00d7 {0} and\n\u03a6(s1 ) = {0} \u00d7 S 1 . The singular locus D is the union of the pieces D1 , D2 , D3 of\nthe absolute line R together with s0 and s1 ; \u03a6G (D) \u2282 O (recall that O \u2282 T2 is the\nunion of the coordinate hyperspaces, i.e. O = {\u03a61 = 0} \u222a {\u03a62 = 0}).\nThe large semicircle S corresponds to the infinite face where two external vertices\ncollide together (or, equivalently, the internal vertex approaches the infinity on H);\n\u03a6G (S) is the diagonal \u2206 \u2282 T2 . This is the only non-relativized boundary face of\nC G.\nThe space C G is a hexagon with the boundary edges D1 , s0 , D2 , s1 , D3 and S;\nthe relativised space (C G , D) is a disc with the boundary S. See Figure 5.\nThe space C G\u2217 of the graph G\u2217 is the same; in order to keep track of the spaces\nwe will denote the corresponding locus by D\u2217 and the boundary face by S \u2217 .\nEach of the open cells CG and CG\u2217 has its unique 2-dimensional cohomology\nclass, and thus the top cohomology of CG \u222aCG\u2217 (or, equivalently, H 2 (C G \u222aC G\u2217 , D \u222a\nD\u2217 \u222a S \u222a S \u2217 )) is 2-dimensional with two generators, which we may identify with G\nand G\u2217 .\nThe map \u03a6G\u2217 differs from \u03a6G by the transposition of two copies of S 1 in T2 .\nIn particular, on the diagonal \u2206 of T2 both maps coincide up to a sign. Thus we\nmay glue C G to C G\u2217 along the remaining (non-relativised) boundary faces S and\nS \u2217 . The gluing however changes the cohomology: we have to add the correponding\nrelation G\u2217 = \u2212G, making H 2 (C1,2 , D) into 1-dimensional. Indeed, (C2,1 , D2,1 )\nis simply S 2 , obtained by gluing two discs (C G , D) and (C G\u2217 , D\u2217 ) along their\nboundaries S and S \u2217 . Note, that it is mapped by \u03a6 also to S 2 , since contracting\nO \u2282 T2 into a point we get (T2 , O) \u223c\n= S 2 . See Figure 6.\nThis simple example prepares us for a general calculation of the top cohomology\nof the grand configuration space below.\n3.7. Cohomology of the configuration space. Let us compute the top cohomology of C n,m . Each cell CG has a unique top cohomology class- the fundamental\nen,m , Xn,m ) = H 2n+m\u22122 (\u2210G CG ) = \u2295 e QG, where\nclass. Thus H 2n+m\u22122 (C\nG\u2208Gn,m\nen,m .

Gluing C G and C G\u2217 together and mapping them to S 2\nen,m along a face, it\nsome gluings. Each time we glue some top dimensional cells of C\nadds a relation on the generators of the cohomology. The gluings along the primary\ninternal faces were made according to the Jacobi relation. The zip-ups of the hidden\nstrata were made according to the antisymmetry relation. No other relations were\nintroduced during these zip-ups, since we glued together several graphs which are\nidentical under \u03a6n,m up to a sign; half of them are negated by the map \u03a6n,m , so the\ntotal sum is 0. We used the antisymmetry relation again to zip up the external faces\ncorresponding to graphs with double edges. Thus H 2n+m\u22122 (Cn,m , \u2202Cn,m \u222a Dn,m )\nis the space of labelled Lie-admissible graphs modulo the Jacobi and the antisymmetry relations. This is not quite Jn,m , since the graphs are labelled, but not too\ndifferent: forgetting a labelling gives a surjective map to Jn,m .\nThus a class in H 2n+m\u22122 (Cn,m , \u2202Cn,m \u222a Dn,m ) (or rather its image Zn,m \u2208 Jn,m\nunder the forgetful map) of a top-degree form w can be written as\nX\nWG [G]\n(6)\nZn,m =\nen,m\nG\u2208G\n\nwhere [G] Ris the equivalence class of G in Jn,m , and the weights WG can be calculated\nas WG = CG w. For what follows it will be important to note that if w is chosen\nso that w|RCG = d\u03b2, then by the Stokes theorem we can compute the weights also\nas WG = \u2202CG \u03b2.\nRemark 3.2. There is another version of this construction in which one works with\nunlabelled graphs, which are mapped not to T2n , but to its quotient under the action\nof S2n transposing the copies of S 1 . While it is somewhat cleaner and requires less\nauxiliary data, it is harder to visualize topologically. There is, however, a simple\ncombinatorial counterpart, which allows one to reduce the summation in (6) to\nunlabelled- and even further to connected- graphs, as will be explained in Section\n3.8 below.\nFurther on we will be mostly interested in m = 2 and m = 3. For these values\nen,2 ) = 2n, and dim(C\nen,3 ) = 2n + 1, so C\nen,2 is mapped by \u03a6n,2\nof m we have dim(C\nen,3 has one excessive dimension.\nto the torus of the same dimension, while C\n\n3.8. Two external\nvertices. For m = 2 we fix a non-trivial 1-form \u03c9 on S 1\nR\nnormalized by S 1 \u03c9 = 1, and take for w the pull-back \u03a6\u2217n,m (\u03c9 2n ) of the volume\nform \u03c9 2n \u2208 \u039b2n (T2n ). So we set\nZ\n\u03a6\u2217n,m (\u03c9 2n )\nWG =\nCG\n\n\f12\n\nMICHAEL POLYAK\n\nin (6). Since different labellings of a graph G \u2208 Gn,2 lead to even transpositions of\ncopies of S 1 in T2n and \u03c9 2n is invariant under such transpositions, the weight WG is\nthe same for all labellings of G. Thus, instead of summing the weights over graphs\nin Gen,2 , we may sum over G \u2208 Gn,2 /AS (picking any orientation and any labelling\ncompatible with it to define \u03a6G and WG ), counting each G with a multiplicity\nbeing the number of its different labellings, i.e. (2n)!| Aut G|, see Remark 2.1 (the\nadditional factor of 2 disappeared since instead of counting each graph in Gn,2 twice\nwith both orientations we take a quotent by the AS relation).\nSumming over all n with a formal parameter hn and an appropriate normalization\nfactor, we denote by Z the following generating function:\n(7)\n\nZ=\n\nX hn Zn,2\nn\n\n(2n)!\n\n=\n\nX h|G| WG\n[G] =\n(2n)!\n\ne2\nG\u2208G\n\nX\n\nG\u2208G2 /AS\n\nh|G| WG\n[G]\n| Aut G|\n\nwhere |G| is the number of the edges of G. Noticing that \u03a6G\u2032 *G\u2032\u2032 = \u03a6G\u2032 \u00d7 \u03a6G\u2032\u2032 for\nany G\u2032 , G\u2032\u2032 \u2208 G2 , we get\nLemma 3.3. The weights are multiplicative, i.e. WG\u2032 *G\u2032\u2032 = WG\u2032 WG\u2032\u2032 for any\nG\u2032 , G\u2032\u2032 \u2208 G2 .\nThere are still quite many terms in each degree in the definition of Z, since\nwe sum over all graphs in G2 . There is a standard trick of taking the logarithm,\nallowing one to count only connected graphs. Denote by G2c the subset of graphs in\nG2 which remain connected after a removal of both external vertices.\nProposition 3.4.\nln(Z) =\n\nX\n\nG\u2208G2c /AS\n\nh|G| WG\n[G]\n| Aut G|\n\nIndeed, for distinct graphs G1 , . . . , Gk we have\n| Aut(Gi11 * . . . Gikk )| = i1 ! . . . ik ! | Aut G1 |i1 . . . | Aut Gk |ik\nwhich together with the multiplicativity of the weights proves the lemma.\n3.9. Coefficients of Z in small degrees. Let us check the coefficients of Z for\nsmall values of n. The only graph in G0,2 has no internal vertices (and no edges);\nits weight is 1. For n = 1 we have two wedge graphs G, G\u2217 , as discussed in Section\n3.6. Since | Aut G| = | Aut G\u2217 | = 1, we get 1/2(WG \u2212 WG\u2217 )[G] for the coefficient\nof h in Z. How can we find WG \u2212 WG\u2217 without direct calculations? Note that\nthe map \u03a61,2 : (C1,2 , D1,2 ) \u2192 (T2 , O) has a well-defined relative degree. It can be\ncomputed by pulling\nback a volume form \u03c9 2 on T2 and integrating it over CG \u222aCG\u2217 ,\nR\nso deg(\u03a6G ) = C1,2 \u03a6\u2217G (\u03c9 2 ) = WG \u2212 WG\u2217 . Another way to compute deg(\u03a6G ) is to\n\ncount the algebraic number of preimages \u03a6\u22121\nG (r) of any regular value r. Choosing\nsome reasonable regular value, we see that there is only one preimage (e.g., for\nr = (\u03c0/2, \u03c0) \u2208 T2 we get \u03a6\u22121\nG (r) = 1 + i \u2208 CG ); thus the coefficient of h in Z does\nnot depend on the choice of \u03c9 and is 1/2.\nWe will use similar arguments in Section 4.2 below.\n\n\fQUANTIZATION OF LINEAR POISSON STRUCTURES AND DEGREES OF MAPS\n\n13\n\n3.10.

Let us\nnow compute the same zero differently- this will give a non-trivial equation on Z.\nBy Proposition 3.1 for m = 3, each boundary face of Cn,3 corresponds to \u0393\u2032 \u25e6 \u0393\u2032\u2032\nwith \u0393\u2032 \u2208 Gn\u2212k,2 , \u0393\u2032\u2032 \u2208 Gk,2 , and the restriction of \u03a6n,3 to it has a product structure\n\u03a6\u0393\u2032 \u00d7 \u03a6\u0393\u2032\u2032 : CG \u00d7 C\u0393 \u2192 T2(n\u2212k) \u00d7 T2k\n\nTherefore, as in Section 3.7 above, the image 0 = w = d\u03b2 in H 2n+1 (Cn,3 , \u2202Cn,3 \u222a\nDn,3 ) of \u03b2 \u2208 H 2n (\u2202Cn,3 , D) may be calculated as\nZ\nX X\nX\n1\n\u03a6\u2217n\u2212k,2 (\u03c9 2(n\u2212k) )\u00d7\u03a6\u2217k,2 (\u03c9 2k ) [\u0393\u2032 \u25e6\u0393\u2032\u2032 ]\n\u2032 \u25e6 \u0393\u2032\u2032 )|\n|\nAut(\u0393\nC\n\u00d7C\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u0393\n\u0393\nk \u0393\u2032 \u2208Gn\u2212k,2 \u0393\u2032\u2032 \u2208Gk,2\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nX\nX\nX\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nW\nW\n\u0393\n\u0393\n\uf8ed\n=\n[\u0393\u2032 ]\uf8f8 \u25e6 \uf8ed\n[\u0393\u2032\u2032 ]\uf8f8\n| Aut \u0393\u2032 |\n| Aut \u0393\u2032\u2032 |\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nk\n\n\u0393 \u2208Gn\u2212k,2\n\n\u0393 \u2208Gk,2\n\nand we conclude that\nProposition 3.5. Z \u25e6 Z = 0.\n4. Quantization of Poisson structures\n4.1. Constructing star products. Let A = \u0393(M, OM ) be the algebra of C \u221e functions on a manifold M . A star product is an associative R[[h]]-linear product\non A[[h]] which, for functions f, g \u2208 A \u2282 A[[h]] is a deformation of the standard\nproduct f g:\n(8)\n\nf \u2217 g = f g + B1 (f, g)h + B2 (f, g)h2 + . . . ,\n\nwhere Bi : A \u00d7 A \u2192 A are bidifferential operators. The product then extends to\nA[[h]] by linearity. A deformation quantization of a Poisson structure on M is a\nconstruction of a star product, first term B1 of which coincides with the (half of)\nPoisson bracket { , } : A \u00d7 A \u2192 A.\nKontsevich [4] have shown that such a quantization always exists. His approach\nis based on an explicit construction of a star product on (an open domain of) Rd ,\nwhich then extends to an arbitrary M .\nThe dual of a Lie algebra has a natural Poisson structure which is linear, i.e. the\ncomponents \u03b1ij of the Poisson tensor \u03b1 = \u03b1ij \u2202i \u2227 \u2202j depend linearly on the coordinates xi . Below we provide a modification of Kontsevich's original construction\nfor linear Poisson structures.\nLet \u03b1 be a linear Poisson bi-vector field on an open domain U \u2282 Rd , defining\na Poisson structure on the algebra A of smooth functions on U. Fix an arbitrary\n1-form \u03c9 on S 1 and define a star product (8) using the series Z of equation 7 and\nthe map B of Section 2.3 from graphs to bidifferential operators by\nf \u2217 g = BZ,\u03b1 (f, g)\n\nfor f, g \u2208 A.\nReturning to the computations of the coefficients of Z in Section 3.9 we see that\nf \u2217 g = f * g + h2 {f, g} + . . . Moreover, translating the statement Z \u25e6 Z = 0 of\nProposition 3.5 to the language of differential operators, we readily obtain\n\n\f14\n\nMICHAEL POLYAK\n\nTheorem 4.1. A star product f \u2217 g = BZ,\u03b1 (f, g) is associative.\nThe above star product a priori depends on the initial choice of the 1-form \u03c9\non S 1 . It is easy to see directly from the definition that Kontsevich's product [4]\ncorresponds to \u03c9 = d\u03c6 being the standard angle form on S 1 .\nWhat can be said about other 1-forms? This is the subject of the remaining part\nof this note.\n4.2. Digression on degrees of maps. If Cn,2 would have no boundary faces apart\nfrom the singular locus Dn,2 , then (similarly to the case n = 1 in Section 3.9) Zn,2\ncould be interpreted as the relative degree of a map \u03a6n,2 : (Cn,2 , Dn,2 ) \u2192 (T2n , O).\nLet me clarify this point: while usually one thinks about the degree deg f of a\nmap f : M \u2192 N between two manifolds being a number, one can equivalently think\nthat it is a vector deg f [M ] in a 1-dimensional vector space (the top cohomology\nof M , generated by the fundamental class [M ] of M ). Equivalently, deg f can\nbe defined as a pull-back f \u2217 ([N ]) of the fundamental class of N , since f \u2217 ([N ]) =\ndeg f [M ]. In our setting M is not a manifold, but a stratified space, so its top\ncohomology is not 1-dimensional, but is generated by graphs. While one can not any\nmore define the degree as a number, the definition of degree as f \u2217 ([N ]) generalizes\nto this situation, with all usual advantages of presenting a topological value as a\ndegree.\nIn particular, we would be able to make two conclusions:\n\u2022 All 1-forms \u03c9 give the same star product;\n\u2022 The coefficients of this star product are rational (with the denominators\narising from the normalization factors 1/(2n)!).\nUnfortunately, this is not the case: the above degree is not well-defined, since in\ngeneral Cn,2 has some boundary faces (so when we change \u03c9, the value of Z may\nchange due to a \"flow\" through these faces). However, at least some partial steps\non this way may be achieved.\n4.3. Comparison of star products: 0-loop part. To understand the boundary\nfaces, note that there is an additional grading on the configuration space by the\nloop number of graphs. Here the loop number l(G) of a graph G is a number of\nconnected components appearing after a removal from G of both external vertices.\nIndeed, the gluing relations (2) and (3) preserve the loop number. Thus Cn,2\nl\ncorresponding to graphs with l(G) = l.\nconsists of non-connected components Cn,2\nAccordingly, any star product splits into pieces enumerated by the loop number of\nthe corresponding graphs. Gutt's star product corresponds to the 0-loop piece:\nProposition 4.2. The 0-loop part of a star product do not depend on the choice\nof a 1-form \u03c9 on S 1 and coincides with the standard Gutt product.\n0\nProof. The first statement follows from the fact that the 0-loop part Cn,2\nof the\nconfiguration space has no non-relativized boundary faces, so the scheme discussed\n0\nin Section 4.2 above works and the 0-loop part Zn,2\nof Zn,2 is, up to a normalization\n0\n0\nby 1/(2n)!, a relative degree of the restriction of \u03a6n,2 to (Cn,2\n, Dn,2\n) \u2192 (T2n , O).\nThus the 0-loop part of all star products are equal. Now results of Kathotia [3],\nwho verified that for the standard angle 1-form on S 1 the coefficients of tree graphs\ncoincide with the Gutt product, imply the theorem.\nOne can also verify this directly, in a purely combinatorial manner, comput0\ning the coefficients by counting the algebraic number of preimages in Cn,2\nof any\n\n\fQUANTIZATION OF LINEAR POISSON STRUCTURES AND DEGREES OF MAPS\n\n15\n\nregular value r \u2208 T2n (so up to normalization factor 1/(2n)! we will get integral coefficients). Note, that this counting is to be performed with labelled graphs; indeed,\nto pass to unlabelled graphs in Section 3.8 we used symmetries, thus would have to\ndeal with (not regular) values on the diagonal of T2n . A lengthy, but rather routine calculation (using Proposition 3.4 for ln(Z)) shows that it indeed gives Gutt's\nproduct. This is illustrated in the Example 4.4 below.\n\u0003\n\n8\n\n4.4. Example. Let us compute the coefficients of 0-loop graphs for n = 2, see\nFigure 7a. The easiest way to perform calculations is to pick a regular value r \u2208 T4\nvery close to the diagonal. Say, let us take r = (\u03c0, \u03c0+\u03b5, \u03c0+2\u03b5, \u03c0+3\u03b5). When \u03b5 \u2192 0,\nthe value approaches the diagonal and internal vertices of graphs in the preimages\ntend to the infinity on H2 . For small \u03b5 the edges connecting these vertices to the\nexternal vertices are almost Euclidean straight lines, as illustrated in Figure 7b.\nThus calculations may be done for simplicity in the Euclidean geometry.\n\n0\n\u03b5\n\na\n\nb\n\nFigure 7. Graphs in G2,2 and preimages of points approaching the diagonal\nThe first graph of Figure 7a is the square of the wedge graph (it splits into\ntwo copies of the wedge graph after the removal of the external vertices), thus its\n1 1 2\ncoefficient should be 2!\n( 2 ) = 18 in view of Proposition 3.4. This is equally easy\nto verify diectly: out of the total of 12 different labellings of 4 edges by {1, 2, 3, 4}\nexactly 3 (namely (e1 , e2 , e\u20321 , e\u20322 ) = (1, 2, 3, 4), (1, 3, 2, 4), (1, 4, 2, 3) and (2, 3, 1, 4))\ngive a preimage. It is also easy to check that for all of them the local degree is +1,\n1\n3 = 81 .\nso the coefficient is indeed 4!\nAs for the second graph of Figure 7a, out of the total of 24 different labellings\nexactly 4 give a preimage, see Figure 8. This is due to elementary geometrical/combinatorial reasons. Consider the internal vertex v for which one of the\nstarting edges ends in the second internal vertex. Obviously, both edges starting in\nv should eminate at angles which are either both smaller or both greater than the\nangle of the edge e connecting their ends. In other words, this pair of edges should\nhave labels either both smaller or both greater than the label of e; see Figure 8. It\nis easy to check that there are only 4 such labellings, depicted in Figure 8. It is\nalso easy to check that the local degree of exactly one of them (the last labelling in\n1\n1\nFigure 8) is \u22121, thus the coefficient is 4!\n(3 \u2212 1) = 12\n.\nBy a similar inductive combinatorial arguments one can calculate the numbers\nof preimages of 0-loop graphs with higher n (getting modified Bernulli numbers).\nDirect visualization of preimages becomes hard for n > 2 since numbers of labellings\n(as well as denominators) grow too fast: for n = 4 it is already 8! = 40320.\n4.5. Graphs with loops. It remains to study the contribution of graphs with\nnon-zero loop numbers. For some choices of an angle form it is easy:\n\n\f16\n\nMICHAEL POLYAK\n\n4\n4\n3\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n3\n1\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n4\n\n2\n4\n3\n\nFigure 8. Labellings corresponding to preimages\nProposition 4.3. Let \u03c9 be any 1-form on S 1 supported on a semicircle {z =\nexp(i\u03c8), a < \u03c8 < a + \u03c0}. Then the corresponding star product is the Gutt product.\nProof. Without a loss of generality, suppose that the form is supported on the lower\nsemicircle {|z| = 1, I(z) < 0}. Now, the weight of any graph which contains an\noriented cycle is zero, since such a cycle should contain an edge directed upwards.\nBut in the linear case each graph with non-zero loop number contains such a cycle.\nThus only 0-loop graphs contribute to the star product.\n\u0003\nIn other cases, the situation is more complicated and at present I fall short of\ncomputing the weights of graphs with non-zero loop numbers for arbitrary 1-forms\non S 1 . The remaining part of this note thus has a preliminary character. Its purpose\nis to explain how a computation of weights of graphs with loops (and two external\nvertices) can be done instead using so-called wheels, which are graphs of the type\ndepicted in Figure 9c. This gives a possibility to compute Kontsevich's weights of\ngraphs with loops via a purely combinatorial count (see Section 4.7 below for an\nexample).\n4.6. Wheels. The above reasoning may be repeated for general n. Indeed, let us\nreturn to the study of the boundary faces of Cn,2 . By Proposition 3.1, these faces\ncorrespond to decompositions G = (G/\u0393) \u25e6 \u0393 where G/\u0393 \u2208 Gen\u2212k,1 , thus is a wheel\n(or a product of wheels) and \u0393 \u2208 Gek,2 . Let us cap-off the boundary faces by some\nnew auxiliary configuration spaces. Recall that passing to ln(Z) instead of Z, we\ncan reduce our consideration only to connected graphs; thus it would suffice to\nproduce a 2n-dimensional space \u0108G with \u2202 \u0108G = CG for each wheel G \u2208 Gen,1 .\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\nFigure 9. Wheels and related configuration spaces\nFor this purpose let us take a space of all embeddings of the vertex set of G in\nH, modulo the 2-dimensional group T h(H) of translations and homotheties of H,\nand construct its compactification \u0108G similarly to Section 3.4. This time there are\nno restrictions on the location of the external vertex v and it is free to run over H.\nThus dim(\u0108G ) = 2(n + 1) \u2212 2 = 2n, and CG can be realized as an infinity boundary\n\n\fQUANTIZATION OF LINEAR POISSON STRUCTURES AND DEGREES OF MAPS\n\n17\n\nface of \u0108G corresponding to all embeddings for which v \u2208 R and the other vertices\nremain in H. An example of a wheel G \u2208 Ge6,1 and points in the corresponding\nconfiguration spaces CG and \u0108G are shown in Figures 9a, 9b, and 9c, respectively.\nIf \u0108G would have no other boundary faces, we would be done. So, let us try\nto get rid of all other strata of \u2202 \u0108G . Other infinity faces are easy to get rid of:\nwhen some internal vertices approach R (probably together with v), some edges e\nmap under \u03c6e to 0, so the image of \u03a6\u0302G belongs to O and the corresponding face\nmay be relativised. Also, we can easily get rid of almost all internal (principal\nand hidden) faces: when vertices of a proper subgraph \u0393 of G collide together,\nG/\u0393 contains some multiple edges, so G/\u0393 and hence also G/\u0393 \u25e6 \u0393 vanish due to\nthe antisymmetry relation. But when all vertices of G collide together, we get\nthe problematic anomaly face \u0108G (R2 ), which is the space of all embeddings of the\nvertex set of G in R2 modulo the action of T h(R2 ).\nThere are various ways to deal with the anomaly face. One of them (not very\nelegant, but working) is as follows: let us consider a graph G\u2032 obtained from G by\nthe reversal of directions of all edges, see Figure 9d. The corresponding compactified\nconfiguration space \u0108G\u2032 of all embeddings of the vertex set of G\u2032 in H is of course\nthe same \u0108G . However, the map \u03a6\u0302G\u2032 differs from \u03a6\u0302G . This time we may relativise\nit on all faces (including the infinite face where only v approaches R), except for the\nanomaly face corresponding to collision of all vertices. But on this anomaly face\n\u03a6\u0302G\u2032 coincides with \u03a6\u0302G up to reflections of some copies of S 1 in T2n . So, folding\neach copy of S 1 in two by identifying z with \u2212z (or, equivalently, doubling the\nangle map a \u2192 2a), we get the maps 2\u03a6G\u2032 and 2\u03a6G to agree on the anomaly face.\nThus we may glue C G\u2032 and C G along the anomaly face, getting a space with the\nonly non-relativised boundary face being the required one. This finishes the cap-off\nconstruction.\nLet me illustrate an application of this idea on a simple example of graphs with\nn = 2 external vertices.\n4.7. Example: 2-spiked wheel. There is only one (up to a choice of an orienta1\ntion) graph \u0393 \u2208 G2,2 with l(\u0393) = 1, see Figure 10a. The only boundary face of C2,2\nwhich was not relativized or zipped-up corresponds to collision of the two external\nvertices of \u0393, see Figures 10b. This face may be identified with CG , where G \u2208 G2,1\nis a wheel with two spikes, shown in Figure 10c. We cap-off this boundary face\nas described above, using an auxiliary 4-dimensional configuration space \u0108G , see\nFigure 10d. The only boundary faces of \u0108G which are not mapped to the singular\nlocus O \u2208 T4 are CG (correspondng to the vertex v of G approaching R) and the\nanomaly face \u0108G (R2 ) (corresponding to all vertices of G colliding together). In this\nexample we can get rid of the anomaly face without using \u0108G\u2032 , simply by folding\neach copy of S 1 in T 4 in two (identifying \u03c6 with \u03c6 + \u03c0).\nAfter we get rid of the last boundary face CG of C\u0393 by gluing to it \u0108G , we\nmay apply the scheme of Section 4.2 to compute the relative degree of the map\n\u03a6\u0393 \u222a \u03a6\u0302G : (C\u0393 \u222a \u0108G , D) \u2192 (T4 , O).
