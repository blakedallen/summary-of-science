Forward elastic scattering process is an excellent\ntest for some fundamental principles (unitarity, analyticity, asymptotic theorems) of modern approaches. In the\ncase of pp and p\u0304p elastic scattering, although many experiments have been made over an extended range of initial energies and momentum transfer, these reactions are\nstill not well understood. One can suggests that by the\ntime the accelerator complexes like RHIC, LHC etc. are\noperating, the interest to the soft physics increases significantly. In the absence of a pure QCD description of\nthe elastic pp/p\u0304p and these large-distance scattering states\n(soft diffraction), an empirical analysis based on modelindependent fits to the physical quantities involved plays\na crucial role [1]. Therefore, empirical fits of energy dependencies of global scattering parameters have been used as\nan important source of the model-independent information. This approach for \u03c3tot and \u03c1 was recently used in\n[2]. The third important quantity for nucleon elastic scattering is the slope parameter. The nuclear slope B for elastic scattering is of interest in its own right. This quantity\ndefined according to the following equation:\n\u2202\nB (s, t) =\n\u2202t\na\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\u03c3 (s, t)\nln\n,\n\u2202t\n\ne-mail: VAOkorokov@mephi.ru; Okorokov@bnl.gov\n\n(1)\n\nis determined experimentally by fitting the \u221adifferential\ncross section d\u03c3/dt at some collision energy s. On the\nother hand the study of B parameter is important, in particular, for reconstruction procedure of full set of helicity\namplitudes for elastic nucleon scattering [2]. In the last 2030 years, high-energy p\u0304p colliders\n\u221ahave extended the\n\u221a maximum p\u0304p collision energy from s \u223c 20 GeV to s \u223c 2\nTeV, the RHIC facility allows to obtain pp data up to\n\u221a\ns = 500 GeV1 . As consequence, the available collection\nof pp and p\u0304p slope data from literature has extended. The\npresent status of slope for elastic pp and p\u0304p scattering\nis discussed over the full energy domain. Predictions for\nfurther facilities are obtained based on the available experimental data.\n\n2 Experimental slope energy dependence\nWe have attempted to describe the energy behavior of\nthe elastic nuclear slopes for pp and p\u0304p reactions. The\nclassical Pomeron theory gives in first approximation the\nfollowing expression for the differential cross section of\nelastic scattering at asymptotically high energies:\nd\u03c3/dt \u221d s2(\u03b1P (t)\u22121) ,\nwhere \u03b1P (t) is a Pomeron trajectory. If \u03b1P (t) is linear\nfunction of momentum transfer, i.e. \u03b1P (t) = \u03b1P (0) + \u03b1\u2032P t,\n1\nAccording\nto the RHIC Run plan the pp data at highest\n\u221a\nenergy s = 500 GeV have to be collected during the spring \u2013\nsummer Run 2009.\n\n\f2\n\nV.A. Okorokov: Slope analysis for elastic nucleon-nucleon scattering\n\nthen for the slope parameter B (s) at some t using the\ndefinition (1) one can obtain\nB (s) \u221d 2\u03b1\u2032P ln s.\nIndeed the ensemble of experimental data on slopes for\nelastic nucleon collisions can be approximated reasonably\n\u221a\nby many phenomenological approaches, at least for s >\n20 GeV. But models contradict the experimental data at\nlower energies and / or phenomenological approaches have\na significant number of free parameters as usual. On the\nother hand it is apparent from previous investigations that\nthe experimental data on slope parameters do not follow\nthe straight lines at any initial energies when plotted as\nfunction of ln s. The new \"expanded\" logarithmic parameterizations with small number of free parameters have\nbeen suggested in [2,3] for description of the elastic slope\nat all available energies. Thus taking into account standard Regge parametrization and quadratic function of logarithm from [4] the following analytic equations are under\nstudy here:\nB (s, t) = B0 + 2a1 ln (s/s0 ) ,\n(2a)\na3\nB (s, t) = B0 + 2a1 ln (s/s0 ) + a2 [ln (s/s0 )] , (2b)\na\nB (s, t) = B0 + 2a1 ln (s/s0 ) + a2 (s/s0 ) 3 ,\n(2c)\n2\n\nB (s, t) = B0 + 2a1 ln (s/s0 ) + a2 [ln (s/s0 )] ,\n\n(2d)\n\nwhere s0 = 1 GeV2 , in general case parameters B0 , ai , i =\n1 \u2212 3 depend on range of |t| which is used for approximation. The function (2d) is a special case of (2b) at fixed\nvalue a3 = 2. Additional terms in (2b) \u2013 (2d) take into account the non-logarithmic part of the energy dependence\nof the elastic nuclear slopes. Approximation function (2c)\nis analogy of parametrization of momentum slope dependence from [5]. One can see the parametrization (2c) is\ncompatible to first order with the Regge pole model where\nthe additional term represents the interference between\nthe Pomeron and secondary trajectories [5].\nMost of experimental investigations as well as theoretical models are focused on the diffraction region |t| \u2243 0\u22120.5\nGeV2 . In this paper we study all available experimental\ndata for nuclear slope parameter up to |t| \u2243 3.6 GeV2 . Experimental data are from [6,7,8,9,10,11]. The data sample consists of about 500 experimental points. The ensemble of experimental data has been slightly specified\nand improved in comparison with [3]. In particular, results obtained in [9] for form-factor parametrization of\nd\u03c3/dt were included in the data sample after detail additional investigation. The total number of experimental\npoints is equal 142/138 for pp/p\u0304p scattering at low |t|,\nrespectively. In the intermediate |t| domain experimental\ndata set is 136/69 for pp/p\u0304p reaction respectively. Thus the\nexperimental sample is significantly larger than that for\nsome early investigations [2,4,5,6,12]. The careful analysis of data sample allows to suggest that the influence of\ndouble counting in the experimental data is negligible. It\nshould be emphasized that the experimental data for intermediate |t| range were separated on two samples which\ncorresponded the various parametrization types for differential cross-section, namely, linear, ln (d\u03c3/dt) \u221d (\u2212B|t|),\n\n\u0001\nand quadratic, ln (d\u03c3/dt) \u221d \u2212B|t| \u00b1 Ct2 , function. Here\nB, C > 0 are suggested. As known the measurements of\nnuclear slope, especially at intermediate |t| do not form\na smooth set in energy, in contrast to the situation for\nglobal scattering parameters \u03c1 and \u03c3tot , where there is a\ngood agreement between various group data [4]. Detailed\ncomparisons of slope data from different experiments are\ndifficult because the various experiments cover different\n|t| ranges, use various fitting procedures, treat systematic\nerrors in different ways, and, moreover, some experimental details are lost, especially, for very early data. We have\ntried to use as much as possible data for fitting from available samples. But some of the B values were not further\nused, either due to internal inconsistencies in the fitting\nprocedure, or as redundant in view of a better determination at a nearby initial energy. Thus the data samples\nfor approximations are somewhat smaller because of exclusion of points which, in particular, differ significantly\nfrom the other experimental points at close energies. Critical for a consistent determination of slope parameters is\nthe choice of the range |t|min \u2264 |t| \u2264 |t|max over which\nthe fit of d\u03c3/dt is performed. It seems both the mean\nvalue of |t| (|t\u0304|) and |t|-boundaries of corresponding measurements are important for separation of experimental\n \u0304 are calculated\nresults on different |t| domains. Here the |t|\nwith taking into account approximations of experimental\nd\u03c3/dt distributions instead of identifying of |t\u0304| with mean\npoint of |t|-range as previously [3]. Errors of experimental\npoints include available clear indicated systematic errors\nadded in quadrature to statistical ones. One need to emphasize the systematic errors caused by the uncertainties\nof normalization (total or/and differential cross sections)\nare not taken into account if these uncertainties are not\nincluded in the systematic errors in the original papers.\nLet us describe the fitting algorithm in more detail. We\nuse the fitting procedure with standard likelihood function\nfor this investigation of nuclear slope parameter. In accordance with [12] let us define the quantity\n\u2206\u03c72i (si ; \u03b1) \u2261\n\n\u0012\n\ni\nBm\n\u2212 B (si ; \u03b1)\n\u03c3i\n\n\u00132\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\ni\nwhere Bm\nis the measured value of nuclear slope at si ,\nB (si ; a) is the expected value from the one of the fitting\nfunctions under consideration, \u03c3i is the experimental error\nof the i-th measurement. The parameters \u03b1j are given by\nthe N -dimensional vector \u03b1 = {\u03b11 , ..., \u03b1N }. Our fitting algorithm is some similar to the \"sieve\" algorithm from [12]\nwith following modification. We reject the points which a\npriori differ significantly from other experimental data at\nclose energies. The step allows us to get a first estimation\nof \u03c72 /n.d.f. with minimum number of rejected points. The\nfit quality is improved at the next steps consequently. As\nindicated above smoothness of experimental slope energy\ndependence differs significantly for data samples in various |t|-domains and for various parameterizations of d\u03c3/dt\n(see below). The \u2206\u03c72i (si ; \u03b1) absolute value can be large\nfor one data sample but it can be acceptable for another\nsample at the same time. Therefore we suggest to use the\n\n\fn\u03c7 =\n\n\u2206\u03c72i (si ; \u03b1)\n\u03c72 /n.d.f.\n\n(4)\n\nin order to reject the outliers (points far off from the fit\ncurve to the data sample) instead of constant cut value\n\u2206\u03c72i (si ; \u03b1)max from the \"sieve\" algorithm [12]. One needs\nto emphasize the fit function with best \u03c72 /n.d.f. among\n(2a) \u2013 (2d) is used for expected value calculation in (3)\nat the each algorithm step. The points with n\u03c7 \u2265 nmax\n\u03c7\nare excluded from future study in our algorithm, where\nthe nmax\nis some empirical cut value. The conventional\n\u03c7\nfit is made to the new \"sifted\" data sample. We consider\nthe estimates of fit parameters as the final results if there\nare no excluded points for present data sample. We use\nthe one value nmax\n= 2 for all data samples considered in\n\u03c7\nthis paper below. The fraction of excluded points is about\n2% for pp as well as for p\u0304p elastic scattering for low |t|\ndomain. The maximum relative amount of rejected points\nis about 3%/12% for linear ln d\u03c3/dt parametrization and\n6%/15% for quadratic one at intermediate |t| values for\npp/p\u0304p scattering respectively.\n2.1 Low |t| domain\nThe energy dependence for experimental slopes and corresponding fits by (2a) \u2013 (2d) are shown at Fig.1 and Fig.2\nfor pp and p\u0304p correspondingly. The fitting parameter values are indicated in Table 1. One can see that the fitting\nfunctions (2a), (2d) describe the pp (Fig.1) and p\u0304p \u221a\n(Fig.2)\nexperimental data statistically acceptable only for s \u2265 5\nGeV. Additional study demonstrate that the extension of\napproximation domain to the lower energies for parameterizations (2a) and (2d) results in significant increasing\nof \u03c72 /n.d.f. for p\u0304p data. Thus these fit functions allow\nto\n\u221a\nget a statistically acceptable fit qualities only at s \u2265 5\nGeV for p\u0304p scattering as well as for elastic pp reaction. The\nparameter a1 for Regge-inspired function (2a) is close to\nestimation for Pomeron parameter \u03b1\u2032P \u2248 0.25 GeV\u22122 for\np\u0304p data but this parameter is some larger than \u03b1\u2032P estimate for proton-proton data. The app\n1 value for (2a) from\nTable 1 is equal within the errors the early experimental\nestimations of \"true\" Pomeron shrinkage parameter [13].\nThe parameter a1 for function (2b) is equal within errors\nto the above estimation for Pomeron theory parameter \u03b1\u2032P\nfor pp data. The value of app\n1 parameter for fitting function\n(2c) agrees with early value for similar fit of slope momentum dependence [5] but the present result is more precise\nthan previous one. The RHIC point for proton-proton collisions has a large error and can't discriminate the approximations. Fitting functions (2b), (2c) allow us to describe\nexperimental data at all energies with reasonable fit quality \u221a\nfor pp. The functions (2a) \u2013 (2c) are close to each other\nat s \u2265 5 GeV, especially, the Regge model approximation and (2c) fit. It seems the ultra-high energy domain is\nsuitable for separation of various parameterizations. The\nqualities of (2b), (2c) approximations for p\u0304p elastic scattering data are much poorer because of very sharp behavior\n\npp\n\nrelative quantity\n\nB , GeV-2\n\nV.A.

Additional study of antiproton-proton\ndata shows that the increasing of low boundary of fit range\n(smin ) leads to the better fit quality for functions (2b),\n(2c) but at the same time, obviously, to the lost of some\nlow-energy p\u0304p data. The fit quality changes dramatically\nat small increasing of smin from low boundary value 4m2p\nto 3.72 GeV2 . It was obtained \u03c72 /n.d.f. \u2243 5.4/5.5 for function (2b) / (2c) respectively for fit range smin \u2265 3.72 GeV2 .\nOn the other hand the data sample is about 75% from\nmaximum one in this case. Thus it seems the smin = 3.72\nGeV2 one of the optimum values from point of view both\nfit quality and closing to the threshold smin = 4m2p . The\naverage value of (3) for excluded points is equal 15.6 for\npp and 649.8 for p\u0304p data sample for parametrization (2b).\nOne can get predictions for nuclear slope parameter\nvalues for some facilities based on the results shown above.\nThe B values at low |t| for different energies of FAIR,\nNICA, RHIC, and LHC are shown in the Table 2. As expected the functions (2b) and (2c) predicted very close\nslope parameter values for FAIR. The\n\u221a approximation function (2a) and (2d) can predict for s \u2265 5 GeV only. Functions (2a) \u2013 (2c) predict much smaller values for B in highenergy pp collisions than (2d) approximation. Perhaps, the\nfuture more precise RHIC results will agree better with\npredictions based on experimental data fits under study.\n\n\f4\n\nV.A.

It should be emphasized that the fits (2a) \u2013 (2c) of\navailable experimental data predict the slower increasing\nof B with energy than most of phenomenological\nmodels\n\u221a\n[15]. The B values predicted for LHC at s = 14 TeV\nby (2a) and (2c) are most close to the some model expectations [16,17]. Moreover\n\u221a one needs to emphasize that\nthe model estimates at s = 14 TeV were obtained for\nB (t = 0) and the t-dependence of slope shows the slight\ndecreasing of B at growth of momentum transfer up to\n|t| \u2248 0.1 \u2212 0.2 GeV2 in particular for the models [16,17].\nThus one can expect the some better agreement between\nmodel estimations and predicted values of B from Table\n2 for finite (non-zero) low |t| values. Possibly the saturation regime, Black Disk Limit, will be reached at the\nLHC. The one of the models in which such effects appear,\nnamely, DDM predicts the slope B (t = 0) \u2248 23 GeV\u22122 at\n\u221a\ns = 14 TeV [18].\n\nS, GeV\n\nFig. 2.

The correspondence of curves to the fit\nfunctions is the same as previously\n\nFigure 3 shows the experimental data and corresponding fits for slope parameter energy dependence at intermediate |t| for pp and p\u0304p elastic scattering. The Fig.3a and\nFig.3c correspond to the linear exponential approximation of differential cross-section for pp and p\u0304p respectively.\nExperimental data obtained at quadratic exponential fit\nof d\u03c3/dt and fitting functions (2a) \u2013 (2d) are presented\nat Fig.3b for pp and at Fig.3d for p\u0304p collisions. The fit-\n\nting parameter values are indicated in Table 3 for various interaction types and for different d\u03c3/dt parameterizations. Usually the fit qualities are poorer for intermediate |t| values than that for low |t| range in pp elastic\ncollisions for linear exponential parametrization of d\u03c3/dt.\nThe fitting functions (2a) and (2d) agree with experimental points qualitatively both for linear (Fig.3a) and\nquadratic (Fig.3b) exponential parameterizations of d\u03c3/dt\n\n\fV.A. Okorokov: Slope analysis for elastic nucleon-nucleon scattering\n\nb (s, t) = B \u00b1 C ln |t|,\n\nB, C > 0\n\n(5)\n\nThis characteristic can be useful for elastic scattering for\nstudy of d\u03c3/dt in wider |t| range. It is suggested b \u2265 0\naccording to the definition (5). The b-parameter is named\nslope too, it is evaluated at |t| = 0.2 GeV2 usually. One of\nthe advantages of this characteristic is the expectation of\nmore smooth energy (momentum) dependence than that\nfor B-parameter discussed above. Indeed we have included\nthe 100% of available experimental points in fitted sample\nfor pp elastic scattering. But the number of points is some\n\npp\n\n\u221a\nfor s \u2265 5 GeV only. The \"expanded\" functions (2b), (2c)\napproximate experimental data at all energies reasonably\nwith very close fit qualities. But the (2b) function shows a\nvery slow\n\u221a growth of slope parameter with energy increasing at s \u2265 100 GeV (Fig.3a). It should be stressed that\nthe fitting function (2d) predicts decreasing of the nuclear\nslope in high energy domain. Such behavior is opposite\nthe other fitting function (2a) \u2013 (2c). In the case of linear\nexponential approximation of d\u03c3/dt mean value of characteristic (4) is about 5.3 for excluded pp data points with\n(2b) function and n\u03c7 \u2243 2.6 for points excluded from p\u0304p\nfitted data sample for (2d) fitting function.\nOne can see that the p\u0304p experimental data admit the\napproximation\nby (2d) for all energy range but not only for\n\u221a\ns \u2265 5 GeV. Indeed the fit quality for the first case much\nbetter than for second one. Additional analysis demonstrated just the same behavior of fit quality for function\n(2a) too. Thus p\u0304p experimental points from linear exponential parametrization of differential cross-section\u221aare fitted by (2a) and (2d) at all energies not only for s \u2265 5\nGeV. The parameter values are shown in Table 3 for approximation by (2a), (2d) of all available experimental\ndata. The p\u0304p data disagreement with Regge-inspired fitting function very significantly (Fig.3c). Functions (2c)\nand (2d) show a very close behavior at all energies for p\u0304p\ndata from linear parametrization of ln d\u03c3/dt. These fitting functions have a better fit quality than (2b) but fits\n(2c), (2d) are still statistically unacceptable. As previously\nexperimental data at Fig.3d allow the approximation\n\u221a by\n(2a) and (2d) for all energy range but not only for s \u2265 5\nGeV. The fit qualities are better in the first case of energy\nrange and fitting parameters are indicated in the Table\n3 for this energy range namely. As above the functions\n(2c) and (2d) show a close fit quality which is some better than this parameter for (2b) fitting function. One can\nsee the fit qualities for (2a) \u2013 (2d) are better significantly\nfor data from quadratic exponential parametrization of\ndifferential cross-sections than for data from linear exponential approximation of d\u03c3/dt. Thus fitting functions\n(2c), (2d) agree with data points at quantitative level for\nquadratic (Fig.3d) parametrization of proton-antiproton\nln d\u03c3/dt and these fits are statistically acceptable. Excluded points are characterized by n\u03c7 \u2243 17.9 for pp data\nwith (2b) fitting function and by n\u03c7 \u2243 12.1 for p\u0304p data\nsample at (2d) function.\nFrom the quadratic exponential parametrization of differential cross-section one may compute the local slope at\na certain |t|-value via the following relation\n\nb , GeV-2\n\n6\n\n15\n12\n10\n10\n8\n6\n5\n4\n\n0.02 \u2264 |t| \u2264 3.6 GeV2\n0.09 \u2264 |t| \u2264 0.28 GeV2\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n10\n\n102\n\n103\n\nS, GeV\nFig. 4. Energy dependence of the slope parameter b at |t| =\n0.2 GeV2 for proton-proton scattering. The correspondence of\ncurves to the fit functions is the same as previously\n\nsmaller than that for B-parameter because of absent Cparameter values for some low energy\nmeasurements from\n\u221a\n[6]. We excluded one point at s = 1.8 TeV [19] from\nfitted sample for p\u0304p elastic reaction because there are unacceptably large errors (relative error is \u03b4b \u2243 2.72) for this\npoint.\nExperimental values of b depend on energy collisions\nand corresponding fits are shown at Fig.4 for pp elastic\nscattering and at Fig.5 for p\u0304p collisions. In the last case\nfit \u221a\nqualities for (2a), (2d) functions are better for fitting\nat s \u2265 5 GeV only than that for fitting of all available\nenergy domain. The fit parameter values are shown in Table 4. Fit qualities are better significantly than that for\ncorresponding fits of B parameter with the exception\u221a of\n(2a) for p\u0304p data. Functions (2a), (2d) approximate\nb ( s)\n\u221a\nfor pp data statistically acceptable for s \u2265 5 GeV only.\nFunctions (2b) and (2c) show acceptable close fit qualities and difference at high energies only. The shrinkage\nparameter app\n1 for best approximation function (2c) is in\na good agreement with a early results [5]. Function (2b)\nshows a best fit quality for p\u0304p data. Thus the \"expanded\"\nparameterizations (2b) and (2c) suppose statistically acceptable representation of all available experimental data\nfor b parameter both in pp and p\u0304p elastic reactions.\nWe have obtained predictions for nuclear slope parameters B and b for some facilities based on the fit results\nshown above. The predicted B values at intermediate |t|\nare calculated on the base of fitting parameters obtained\nfor linear exponential parametrization of d\u03c3/dt.

Energy dependence of the slope parameter b at |t| = 0.2\nGeV2 for antiproton-proton scattering. The correspondence of\ncurves to the fit functions is the same as previously\n\n\u221a\nenergies under study not in s \u2265 5 GeV domain only.\nAs expected the functions (2c) and (2d) predicted very\nclose slope parameter values for FAIR. All fitting functions, especially (2b) and (2c), predict the close values for\nnuclear slope in NICA energy domain. Functions (2a) \u2013\n(2c) predict larger values for B in high-energy pp collisions than (2d) approximation. Perhaps, the future more\nprecise RHIC results will be useful for discrimination of\nfitting functions under study for intermediate |t| values.\nThe function (2d) with obtained parameters predicts negative B values at future LHC energies. It should be emphasized that various phenomenological models predict a very\nsharp decreasing of nuclear\n\u221a slope in the range |t| \u223c 0.3\u22120.5\nGeV2 at LHC energy s = 14\u221aTeV [11]. Just the negative\nB value predicted for LHC at s = 14 TeV by (2d) is most\nclose to the some model expectations [17,20]. Taking into\naccount predictions in Table 2 based on the fitting functions (2a) \u2013 (2d) for low |t| one can suggest that the model\nwith hadronic amplitude corresponding to the exchange of\nthree pomerons [15,17] describes the nuclear slope some\ncloser to the experimentally inspired values at LHC energy\nboth at low and intermediate |t| than other models. One\ncan see the functions (2b) and (2c) predict very close values of b up to LHC energies. Function (2d) shows a much\nslower decreasing of b at LHC energy domain than that for\nB parameter. The values of b parameter differ significantly\nfrom each other for various fitting functions in ultra-high\nenergy domain for pp collisions and at low energies for\np\u0304p elastic scattering. It seems b parameter is more perspective for distinguishing of Regge-inspired function\n\u221a (2a)\nfrom \"expanded\" parameterizations (2b), (2c) at s \u2265 0.5\n\nPhenomenological models predicts the zero difference of\nslopes (\u2206B) for proton-antiproton and proton-proton elastic scattering at asymptotic energies. Here the difference\n\u2206B is calculated for each function (2a) \u2013 (2d) under study\nwith parameters corresponded p\u0304p and pp fits: \u2206Bi (s) =\nBip\u0304p (s) \u2212 Bipp (s) , i = 2a,...2d2 . It should be stressed that\nthe equal energy domain are used in p\u0304p and pp fits for\n\u2206B calculations, i.e. the parameter values obtained by\n(2d) fitting function\n\u221a for p\u0304p data from linear exponential\nfit of d\u03c3/dt for s \u2265 5 GeV are used for corresponding\n\u2206B definition. The energy dependence of \u2206B is shown\nat Fig.6a and Fig.6b for low and intermediate |t| respectively. One can see that the difference of slopes decreasing with increasing of energy for low |t| domain (Fig.6a).\nAt present the proton-proton experimental data at highest available energy 200 GeV don't contradict with fast\n(square of logarithm of energy) increasing of slope at high\nenergies in general case. Such behavior could be agreed\nwith the asymptotic growth of total cross section. But on\nthe other hand the quadratic logarithmic function (2d)\nleads to very significant difference \u2206B for p\u0304p and pp scattering in high energy domain for both low (Fig.6a) and intermediate (Fig.6b) values of |t|. The only Regge-inspired\nfunction (2a) predicts the decreasing of \u2206B with energy\ngrowth at intermediate |t| (Fig.6b). The parameterizations\n(2b) \u2013 (2d) predict the decreasing of difference of slopes at\nlow and intermediate energies and fast increasing of \u2206B\nat higher energies for intermediate |t| domain (Fig.6b). As\nexpected the most slow changing of \u2206B is predicted by\nRegge-inspired function (2a) at asymptotic energies. All\nfitting functions with experimentally inspired parameters\ndon't predict the constant zero values of \u2206B at high energies. But it should be emphasized that only separate\nfits were made for experimental data for pp and p\u0304p elastic reactions above. These results indicate on the importance of investigations at ultra-high energies both pp and\np\u0304p elastic scattering for many fundamental questions and\npredictions related to the general asymptotic properties of\nhadronic physics.\nAlso we have analyzed general data samples for pp\nand p\u0304p elastic scattering. Slope parameters\n(B and b)\n\u221a\nshows a different energy dependence at s < 5 GeV in\nproton-proton and antiproton-proton elastic reactions in\nany |t| domains under study. Thus slopes\nfor nucleon\u221a\nnucleon data are investigated only for s \u2265 5 GeV below.\nWe have included in fitted samples only pp and p\u0304p points\nwhich were included in corresponding final data samples\nat separate study pp and p\u0304p elastic reactions above. We\ndid not exclude any points from N N data sample, we\nchange only the low energy boundary for fitted domain.\n2\nObviously, one can suggest various combinations of fitting\nfunctions for \u2206B calculations, for example, the difference between fitting functions with best fit qualities etc.\n\n\f1\n\n\u2206 B=B -B , GeV-2\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n8\n\n0.8\n\npp\n\n2\n\n0.61\n\npp\n\npp\n\n3\n\n9\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\npp\n\n\u2206 B=B -B , GeV-2\n\nV.A.

Functions (2b) \u2013 (2d)\nshow close fit qualities. Best fit is (2d) but \"expanded\"\nparameterizations agree with data too. One needs to emphasize the\n\u221asignificant errors and absence of experimental\npoints at s \u2243 0.1 \u2212 2 TeV that trouble the more clear\nconclusion. The RHIC as well as LHC data for nucleonnucleon differential cross-section at intermediate |t| will\nbe helpful for distinguishing of various fit functions.\nOne can conclude the slope parameters for\n\u221a pp and p\u0304p\nelastic scattering show universal behavior at s \u2265 20 GeV\nand \"expanded\" functions represent the energy dependencies for both low and intermediate |t| ranges for this energy domain. Thus quantitative analysis of slopes at different |t| allows us\u221ato get the following estimation of low\nenergy boundary: s \u2243 20 GeV for universality of elastic nucleon-nucleon scattering. This estimates agrees with\nresults for differential cross-sections of pp and p\u0304p elastic\nreactions based on the crossing-symmetry and derivative\nrelations [2].\n\n3 Conclusions\nThe main results of this paper are the following. Slope\nenergy dependencies are analyzed quantitatively for elastic nucleon-nucleon scattering in various |t| domains. Most\nof all available experimental data for slope parameter in\nelastic nucleon collisions are approximated by different analytic functions.\nThe suggested new parameterizations allow us to describe experimental nuclear slope at all available energies\nin low |t| domain for pp quite reasonably. The new approximations agree with experimental p\u0304p data at qualitative level but these fits are still statistically unacceptable\nbecause of very sharp behavior of B near the low energy\nlimit. The best fit quality is obtained for \"expanded\" logarithmic function both for pp and p\u0304p data. The obtained\nvalues of asymptotic shrinkage parameter \u03b1\u2032P for pp elastic scattering are larger than \u03b1\u2032P values for elastic p\u0304p reactions for the same fitting functions. Various approximations differ from each other both in the low energy and\nvery high energy domains. Predictions for slope parameter are obtained for elastic proton-proton and protonantiproton scattering in energy domains of some facilities\nat low momentum transfer.

Experimental fitted points are indicated as N for\n\u221a\npp and as H for p\u0304p. Fits are shown for smin = 20 GeV. The\ncorrespondence of curves to the fit functions is the same as\npreviously\n\nall available experimental data don't contradict the phenomenological model estimations qualitatively. The situation is more unclear at intermediate |t| values than for low\n|t| domain. Only the qualitative agreement is observed between approximations and experimental points both for pp\nand p\u0304p collisions for linear exponential parametrization of\nd\u03c3/dt because of poorer quality of data. The \"expanded\"\nlogarithmic function describes of pp data for B parameter\nfor any differential cross-section parametrization reasonably. Best fit quality is obtained for quadratic function\nof logarithm for p\u0304p data. One needs to emphasize that\nthis function allows us to describe p\u0304p data at all available energies and shows a statistically acceptable fit quality for data sample obtained from quadratic exponential\nparametrization of d\u03c3/dt. Slope parameter b calculated at\n|t| = 0.2 GeV2 shows more smooth energy dependence. We\nhave obtained an acceptable fit qualities for \"expanded\"\nfunctions both for pp and p\u0304p data at all initial energies.\nThe obtained values of asymptotic shrinkage parameter\n\u03b1\u2032P for pp elastic scattering are close to the early results\nboth in low and intermediate |t| domain. As well as for low\n|t| domain predictions for slope parameters B and b are\nobtained for elastic proton-proton and proton-antiproton\nscattering in energy domains of some facilities.

The\n\u2206B parameter shows the opposite behaviors at high energies for low and intermediate |t| domains (decreasing /\nincreasing, respectively) for all fitting functions with the\nexception of Regge-inspired one. The last function predicts\nthe slow decreasing of \u2206B with energy growth. It should\nbe emphasized that all underlying empirical fitting functions with experimentally inspired parameter values don't\npredict the zero difference of slopes for proton-antiproton\nand proton-proton elastic scattering both at low and intermediate |t| for high energy domain. We have analyzed\n\u221a\ngeneral nucleon-nucleon data samples for slopes at s \u2265 5\nGeV. The \"expanded\" functions show\n\u221a the best and statistically acceptable fit qualities at s \u2265 20 GeV for low |t|\ndomain. Slop analysis allows us to find the following value\n0.24 \u00b1 0.01 for \u03b1\u2032P parameter. The estimation of asymptotic shrinkage parameter \u03b1\u2032P obtained with \"expanded\"\nfunctions for N N data agree very well with Pomeron theory expectation. The quadratic logarithmic function represents experimental N N data for B and b slope parameters with best quality. But the functions (2b) and (2c)\nshow a close qualities and agree with data reasonably.\nTherefore suggested \"expanded\" functions can be used as\na reliable fits for wide range of momentum transfer at all\n\nParameter\na2 , GeV\u22122\nB-parameter\n\u2013\n277 \u00b1 46\n177 \u00b1 28\n0.081 \u00b1 0.006\nb-parameter\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2212595 \u00b1 662\n144 \u00b1 40\n\u2212152 \u00b1 287\n13 \u00b1 31\n\u22120.010 \u00b1 0.005\n0.17 \u00b1 0.05\n\na3\n\n\u03c72 /n.d.f.\n\n\u2013\n\u22120.06 \u00b1 0.01\n\u22120.036 \u00b1 0.003\n\u2013\n\n271/34\n110/32\n103/32\n102/33\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u22126 \u00b1 3\n\u22121 \u00b1 2\n\u22121.7 \u00b1 0.6\n0.10 \u00b1 0.08\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n221/40\n15.3/7\n206/38\n2.43/5\n205/38\n2.40/5\n217/39\n2.40/6\n\nenergies.
