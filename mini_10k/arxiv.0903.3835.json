The direct product S = S1 \u00d7. . .\u00d7Ss\nis a partially ordered semigroup: v \u2032 = (v1\u2032 , . . . , vs\u2032 ) \u2265 v \u2032\u2032 = (v1\u2032\u2032 , . . . , vs\u2032\u2032 ) iff\nvi\u2032 \u2265 vi\u2032\u2032 for all i = 1, . . . , s (vi\u2032 , vi\u2032\u2032 \u2208 Si ). For a germ g \u2208 OX,0 , let v(g) :=\n(v1 (g), . . . , vs (g)).\nDefinition: The ring Z[[S]] of power series onP\nthe semigroup S = S1 \u00d7. . . \u00d7Ss\nis the set of formal expressions of the form\nav t v (v := (v1 , . . . , vs ) \u2208 S,\nv\u2208S\n\nt v := t1v1 * . . . * tsvs ) with the usual ring operations.\n\nRemarks. 1. The fact that Z[[S]] is a ring (i.e. that the multiplication is\ndefined) follows from the described properties of the semigroup of values of a\nvaluation.\n2. If Gi = Z for i = 1, . . . , s, the ring Z[[S]] is contained in the ring\nZ[[t1 , . . . , ts ]] of power series in the variables t1 , . . . , ts with integer coefficients\nand thus an element of the ring Z[[S]] is a usual power series in the variables\nt1 , . . . , ts .\nThe collection {vi } of valuations defines a multi-index filtration on the ring\nOX,0 by the ideals\nJ(v) = {g \u2208 OX,0 : v(g) \u2265 v}\n(indexed by the elements v of the group G = G1 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 Gs ). For I \u2282 I0 =\n{1, . . . , s}, v = (v1 , . . . , vs ) \u2208 G, let\nJ +I (v) := {g \u2208 J(v) : vi (g) > vi for i \u2208 I} ,\nJ + (v) := J +I0 (v).\nDefinition: The Poincar\u00e9 series P{vi } (t1 , . . . , ts ) of the collection of valuations\n{vi } is the element of the ring Z[[S]] defined by\n!\nX X\n\u0001\n(\u22121)#I dim J +I (v)/J + (v) * t v .\nP{vi } (t) =\nv\u2208S\n\nI\u2282I0\n\n2\n\n\fOne can see that, for collections of integer valued valuations, this definition\ncoincides with that used e.g. in [1]. One can easily extract a proof of this from\nthe proof of Theorem 3 in [1].\nRemark. This notion is defined if all the factor spaces J +I (v)/J + (v) have\nfinite dimensions. This takes place if each valuation vi , i = 1, . . . , s, is centred\nat the origin, i.e. {g \u2208 OX,0 : vi (g) > 0} coincides with the maximal ideal m\nof the ring OX,0 .\nDefinition: A valuation v with values in a group G is finitely determined if,\nfor each v0 \u2208 G, the condition v(g) = v0 is a constructible condition on a jet\nof the germ g of a certain (finite) order (see [2]).\nExamples. 1. For an irreducible plane curve germ C = {f = 0} \u2282 (C2 , 0),\nlet \u03c6 : (C, 0) \u2192 (C2 , 0) be a parametrization (uniformization) of the curve C.\nFor a germ g \u2208 OX,0 , let vC (g) be the order of zero of the function g \u25e6 \u03c6(\u03c4 ) at\nthe origin (if g \u25e6 \u03c6 \u2261 0, vC (g) := +\u221e). The map vC : OX,0 \u2192 Z \u222a {+\u221e} is\na finitely determined rank 1 valuation on the ring OX,0 . (This valuation has a\nnon-trivial kernel, i.e. vC (g) = +\u221e for some g 6= 0.)\n2. For the same curve C = {f = 0} and for g \u2208 OX,0 , g 6= 0, let g = f kC (g) g \u2032,\nwhere g \u2032 is not divisible by f . The map wC : OX,0 \u2192 Z2 \u222a {+\u221e}, wC (g) :=\n(kC (g), vC (g \u2032 )), is a rank 2 valuation on the ring OX,0 . (The group Z2 is ordered\nlexicographically, i.e. (k \u2032 , v \u2032) > (k \u2032\u2032 , v \u2032\u2032 ) iff k \u2032 > k \u2032\u2032 or k \u2032 = k \u2032\u2032 and v \u2032 > v \u2032\u2032 .) The\nvaluation wC is not finitely determined: for k > 0, the condition kC (g) = k is\nnot determined by a (finite) jet of the germ g. (The kernel of the valuation\nwC is trivial.)\nThe notion of integration with respect to the Euler characteristic \u03c7 over\nthe projectivization POX,0 of the ring OX,0 was defined in [2]. The argument\nfrom [2] give the following statement.\nProposition 1. If all the valuations vi , i = 1, . . . , s, are finitely determined,\none has\nZ\nP{vi } (t) =\n(1)\nt v(g) d\u03c7 .\nPOX,0\n\nRemark. One can formulate the notion of the Poincar\u00e9 series of a collection\nof valuations in terms of the extended semigroup of the collection in spirit of\n[1], [6].\n\n2\n\nValuations on OC2 ,0\n\nLet \u03c0 : (X, D) \u2192 (C2 , 0) be a modification of the plane by a (finite) sequence of\nblowing-ups. The exceptional divisor D is the union of irreducible components\nE\u03c3 (\u03c3 \u2208 \u0393); each of them is isomorphic to the complex projective line CP1 .\nThe dual graph of the modification \u03c0 consists of vertices corresponding to the\n3\n\n\firreducible components E\u03c3 , i.e. to elements of \u0393; two vertices are connected\nby an edge iff the corresponding components intersect. To \u03c3 \u2208 \u0393, i.e. to\nan irreducible component E\u03c3 of the exceptional divisor, there corresponds a\nnatural valuation v\u03c3 : the divisorial one. For a germ g \u2208 OX,0 the value v\u03c3 (g) is\ndefined as a multiple of (say, c\u03c3 times) the order w\u03c3 (g) of zero of the function\ng \u25e6 \u03c0 along the component E\u03c3 (i.e. of the coefficient at [E\u03c3 ] in the zero divisor\nof the function g \u25e6 \u03c0). It is convenient to choose the coefficient c\u03c3 in such a\nway that min v\u03c3 (g) = 1, i.e. c\u03c3 = 1/w\u03c3 (g) for a generic function g \u2208 m.\ng\u2208m\n\nIt is known ([8], see also [5]) that all valuations on the ring OX,0 centred\nat the origin (i.e. such that v(g) > 0 for g \u2208 m) are given by the following list.\nI. All rank 1 valuations centred at the origin correspond to some sequences\n(finite or infinite) of blowing-ups such that each next blowing-up is made at a\npoint of the divisor born on the previous step. To get a one-to-one correspondence, one should exclude sequences of blowing-ups made at each step after a\ncertain one at the intersection point of a fixed divisor E\u03c30 with the last one. (In\nsuch case the correspondence described below leads to the divisorial valuation\nv\u03c30 associated to the divisor E\u03c30 .) If the sequence is finite, the corresponding\nvaluation is the divisorial one associated to the last divisor. If the sequence is\ninfinite, the value v(g) of the corresponding valuation is defined as the limit\nlim v\u03c3i (g) where v\u03c3i is the divisorial valuation associated to the divisor born\ni\u2192\u221e\non i-th step. Depending on the sequence of blowing-ups, one can distinguish\nthe following types of valuations.\nI.1. The blowing-ups are made at the intersection points of the strict transforms of a fixed irreducible curve C = {f = 0} \u2282 (C2 , 0) with the exceptional\ndivisor. The corresponding valuation (a curve valuation of rank 1) is equivalent to the valuation defined by the order of a function g on the curve C in an\nuniformization parameter (Example 1 above). The corresponding dual graph\nof the modification has a growing infinite tail: Fig.1. This valuation has a\nnon-trivial kernel.\n1r r r r r r r r r \u2663\u2663\u2663 r r r \u2663\u2663\u2663\nr\nr\nr\n\nr\nr\nr\nr\n\nFigure 1: The dual graph of a valuation of type I.1.\nI.2. The sequence of blowing-ups produces an infinite tail like on Fig.1, but\nthere exists no curve corresponding to this sequence (one can say that there is\na formal curve defined by a formal power series), one gets a discrete valuation\nwith the trivial kernel: a formal curve valuation.\nI.3. The sequence of blowing-ups increases the number of rupture points\nproducing, as the limit, the graph shown on Fig.2. In this case the group\nof values is contained in the ring Q of rational numbers and is not finitely\n4\n\n\fgenerated. For any g \u2208 OC2 ,0 , one has v(g) = v\u03c3i (g) for i sufficiently large.\nValuations of this sort we call infinite valuations.\n1r r r r r r r r r \u2663\u2663\u2663 r r r r r \u2663\u2663\u2663\nr\nr\nr\n\nr\nr\nr\nr\n\nr\n\nr\nr\nr\nr\n\n\u2663 \u2663 \u2663\n\nFigure 2: The dual graph of a valuation of type I.3.\nI.4. In the cases I.2 and I.3 blowing-ups were made either permanently\nafter a certain step or from time to time at a smooth point of the last divisor.\nIf this is not the case (i.e. if all the blowing-ups starting from a moment are\nproduced at an intersection point of the last divisor with a previous one but\nnot with one and the same) one gets a valuation with a finitely generated group\nof values, which is not contained in Q (an irrational valuation).\nII. Besides that there are two kinds of rank 2 valuations on the ring OC2 ,0 .\nII.1. For an irreducible curve germ C = {f = 0} \u2282 (C2 , 0) one has the\nvaluation described in Example 2: curve valuations of rank 2. Valuations of\nthis type are the only ones on the list which are not finitely determined.\nII.2. For a divisor E\u03c3 of a modification \u03c0 : (X, D) \u2192 (C2 , 0) and for a point\nP on it, let E\u03c3 be locally given by an equation u = 0. Then we can define a\nrank 2 valuation v = v(g) with values in the group Z2 ordered lexicographically\napplying the construction of II.1 to the germ of function g \u25e6 \u03c0 at the point P\nof the curve u = 0. This means that one writes g \u25e6 \u03c0 as uv\u03c3 (g) g \u2032 where g \u2032 \u2208\n/ hui\n(v\u03c3 (g) is just the value of g with respect to the divisorial valuation v\u03c3 ) and\nputs v(g) := (v\u03c3 (g), wu(g \u2032 )), where wu (g \u2032) is the order of zero of the function\ng \u2032 on the smooth curve u = 0 at the point P . This valuation is called an\nexceptional curve valuation.\nIf one excludes valuations of type I.1. (i.e. those which have a non-trivial\nkernel), one can say that all valuations on the ring OC2 ,0 are in one to one\ncorrespondence with all (finite and infinite) sequences of blowing-ups of the\ndescribed type. In this case sequences of blowing-ups excluded in I correspond\nto valuations of type II.2. To a sequence of the type described in I.1 one\nassociates the valuation II.1 (of rank 2) corresponding to the curve germ.\nRemarks. 1. A valuation of type I.1 is essentially the second component of\nthe corresponding valuation of type II.1. If one considers the ring C[[x, y]] of\nformal power series in two variables instead of OC2 ,0 , valuations of type I.1 and\nI.2 constitute one and the same type. The results of the paper are valid in this\nsetting as well.\n2. Except valuations centred at the origin, there are so called f -adic valuations\nkC corresponding to irreducible plane curve singularities C = {f = 0} \u2282\n(C2 , 0). For a germ g \u2208 OC2 ,0 \\ {0}, kC (g) is defined by the relation g =\nf kC (g) g \u2032 where g \u2032 \u2208\n/ hf i. This is just the first component of the rank 2 curve\nvaluation corresponding to C. For an appropriate definition, the Poincar\u00e9\n5\n\n\fseries of a collection of valuations containing f -adic ones is a reduction of the\nPoincar\u00e9 series of the collection obtained by substituting f -adic ones by the\ncorresponding plane curve valuations of rank 2.\nFor further discussions it is convenient to use a notion of a resolution of\na (finite) collection of valuations. For a divisorial valuation this is a modification \u03c0 : (X, D) \u2192 (C2 , 0) of the plane by a finite sequence of blowing-ups\nover the origin which contains the corresponding divisor (this means that if\nis a modification of the minimal resolution by a finite sequence of blowingups). For a valuation of one of the types I, II.1, let \u03c0i : (Xi , Di ) \u2192 (C2 , 0)\nbe the modification obtained at the i-th step of the corresponding sequence of\nblowing-ups. Let (X, D) be the projective limit (in the category of analytical\nspaces) of the sequence {(Xi , Di )} and let \u03c0 : (X, D) \u2192 (C2 , 0) be the corresponding map. One can see that X is a smooth complex surface and D is the\nunion of infinitely many projective lines on it. The map \u03c0 : (X, D) \u2192 (C2 , 0)\nwill be called the minimal resolution of the valuation. This is not a resolution\nsince since, in particular, the map \u03c0 is not proper. For a valuation of type\nII.2, the minimal resolution will be defined as the minimal resolution of the\ncorresponding divisorial valuation (the first component of the considered one)\nfollowed by an additional blowing-up at the corresponding point. Thus in the\nminimal resolution the point under consideration is an intersection point of\ncomponents of the exceptional divisor.\nThe minimal resolution of a finite collection of valuations is the projective\nlimit of the corresponding (multi-index) system of modifications. It is simply\nthe fibre product of the minimal resolutions of all valuations.\nFinally a resolution of a finite collection of valuations is a modification of\nthe space (X, D) of the minimal resolution by a finite number of blowing-ups\n(at points of D).\n\n3\n\nPoincar\u00e9 series of a collection of plane valuations\n\nLet vi , i = 1, . . . , s, be a set of valuations on the ring OC2 ,0 centred at the\norigin. Let \u03c0 : (X, D) \u2192 (C2 , 0) be a resolution of the set of valuations {vi }.\nFor a component E\u03c3 of the exceptional divisor D, \u03c3 \u2208 \u0393, let L\u03c3 be a smooth\ngerm of curve transversal to D at a smooth point of it, let the curve germ\nl\u03c3 = \u03c0(L\u03c3 ) \u2282 (C2 , 0) be given by an equation {g\u03c3 = 0}, and let m\u03c3i = vi (g\u03c3 ),\nm\u03c3 := (m\u03c31 , . . . , m\u03c3s ) \u2208 G.\nWithout loss of generality one can suppose that v1 , . . . , vr are valuations\nof type II.1 (or rank 2) and the others are not. For a component E\u03c3 of the\n\u25e6\n\nexceptional divisor D, let E\u03c3 be its \"smooth part\", i.e. E\u03c3 itself minus the\nintersection points with all other components of D. For i = 1, . . . , r, let\nCi = {fi = 0} be the corresponding curve, fi \u2208 OC2 ,0 .\nTheorem 1. The Poincar\u00e9 series of the set of valuations {vi } is given by the\n6\n\n\fequation\nP{vi } (t) =\n\nY\n\n\u25e6\n\n(1 \u2212 t\n\nm\u03c3 \u2212\u03c7(E\u03c3 )\n\n)\n\nr\nY\nY v (f )\n(1,0)\ntj j i )\u22121 .\n\u00d7\n(1 \u2212 ti\n\n(2)\n\nj6=i\n\ni=1\n\n\u03c3\u2208\u0393\n\nProof. One cannot use the equation (1) directly since valuations of type II.1\nare not finitely determined. However the condition vi (g) = (0, v) is defined by\na jet of the germ g of a finite order. Therefore let us first compute the part\nP o (t) of the Poincar\u00e9 series P{vi } (t) which consists of monomials which are not\n(1,0)\ndivisible by any of ti , i = 1, . . . , r. One can see that\nZ\no\nP (t) =\nt v d\u03c7\nP(OC2 ,0 \\\n\nr\nS\n\nhfi i)\n\ni=1\n\nComputation of P o (t) essentially repeats the arguments from, e.g., [2] or\n[6]. To compute the series P o(t) up to terms of any fixed degree V \u2208 G one\ncan make finitely many additional blowing-ups at intersection points of the\nr\nS\ncomponents of the exceptional divisor D so that, for a germ g \u2208 OC2 ,0 \\ hfi i\ni=1\n\nwith v(g) \u2264 V , all the intersection points of the strict transform of the curve\n\u25e6\nS \u25e6\n{g = 0} with the exceptional divisor D belong to its smooth part D = E\u03c3 .\n\nLet\n\nOCV 2 ,0\n\n= {g \u2208\n/\n\nr\nS\n\n\u03c3\n\nhfi i : v(g) \u2264 V }, and let\n\ni=1\n\nOCD2 ,0\n\nbe the set of germs\n\ng \u2208 OC2 ,0 \\ {0} such that the intersection points of the strict transform of the\n\u25e6\n\ncurve {g = 0} with the exceptional divisor D belong to D . The integral\nZ\nt v d\u03c7\nPO D2\n\nC ,0\n\nover the projectivization POCD2 ,0 contains all terms of the series P o(t) up to\ndegree V . There is a map from POCD2 ,0 to the space of effective divisors on\n\u25e6\n\nD : to a function germ g \u2208 OCD2 ,0 one associates the intersection of the strict\ntransform of the curve {g = 0} with the exceptional divisor D. Proposition\n2 from [2] implies that the preimage of a point with respect to this map is\na complex affine space and thus has the Euler\ncharacteristic equal to 1. The\nR\nFubini formula implies that the integral POD t v d\u03c7 is equal to the integral\nC2 ,0\n\nwith respect to the Euler characteristic of the monomial t v over the space of\n\u25e6\neffective divisors on D , where v is the additive function on the space of effective\n\u25e6\n\ndivisors (with values in G) equal to m\u03c3 for a point from the component E\u03c3 of\n\u25e6\n\nD.\n\n\u25e6\n\nThe space of effective divisors on D is the direct product of the spaces of\n\u25e6\neffective divisors on the components E\u03c3 , \u03c3 \u2208 \u0393. Each of the latter ones is the\n7\n\n\f\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\ndisjoint union of the symmetric powers S k E\u03c3 of the component E\u03c3 .

It consists of vertices corresponding to the irreducible components of the exceptional divisor D; two vertices\n8\n\n\fare connected by an edge if the corresponding components intersect. The set\nof vertices of the dual graph inherits a partial order defined by approximation\nof the modification by sequences of blowing-ups: a component E\u03c3\u2032 is \"greater\"\nthan another component E\u03c3 (\u03c3 \u2032 > \u03c3) if the exceptional divisor of the minimal\nmodification which contains E\u03c3\u2032 also contains E\u03c3 . Two resolutions are called\ncombinatorially equivalent if their dual graphs together with the partial orders\nare isomorphic.\nFor collections of valuations of types I.1 and I.2 the Poincar\u00e9 series coincides with the Alexander polynomial (in several variables) of the corresponding\nalgebraic link (obtained by cutting the non-convergent series for a valuation of\ntype I.2) (see [1]). It is known that the Alexander polynomial of an algebraic\nlink determines the topology of the curve singularity ([7], see another proof in\n[3]). Therefore the Poincar\u00e9 series of a collection of such valuations determines\nits minimal resolution up to combinatorial equivalence.\nIn [3], it was shown that the Poincar\u00e9 series of a collection of divisorial\nvaluations \"determines the topology of the set of divisors\" in the sense that\nit determines the dual graph of the minimal resolution up to combinatorial\nequivalence. Moreover, it was shown that the Poincar\u00e9 series of a collection of\nvaluations which includes both divisorial ones and those of types I.1 (or I.2)\ndoes not determine, in general, the dual graph of the minimal resolution.\nTheorem 2. Suppose that a collection {vi } of valuations does not contain valuations if types I.1 and I.2. Then the Poincar\u00e9 series P{vi } (t) of the collection\ndetermines types of the valuations, the dual graph of the minimal resolution up\nto combinatorial equivalence and divisors or sequences of divisors corresponding to the valuations.\nIn what follows, for short, we shall simply say that the Poincar\u00e9 series\ndetermines the dual graph of the minimal resolution.\nProof. One property of collections of valuations of the type under consideration\nused in the proof is the fact that the projection formula holds for them. This\nmeans that, for a subset I \u2282 I0 = {1, . . . , s}, the Poincar\u00e9 series of the set of\nvaluations {vi }i\u2208I is obtained from the Poincar\u00e9 series of the whole set {vi }\nby omitting the variables ti with i \u2208\n/ I (in other words by substituting ti with\ni\u2208\n/ I by 1).\nRemark. Omitting a valuation of type I.3 (an infinite valuation), as a factor\none formally gets an infinite product of the form\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(1 \u2212 t m )(1 \u2212 t m )\u22121 (1 \u2212 t m )(1 \u2212 t m )\u22121 . . .\nThis product should be canceled.\nThe projection formula follows directly from the equation (2) (Theorem 1).\nRemark. For collections of valuations which do not contain valuations of type\nII.1 (curve valuations of rank 2) this can be also deduced from equation (1).\nThe fact that the projection formula holds for valuations of type II.1 as well\n9\n\n\fcan mean that this valuations can be considered finitely determined in some\nweak sense.\nThe projection formula implies that, from the Poincar\u00e9 series of a collection of valuations, one can restore, in particular, the Poincar\u00e9 series of each\nindividual valuation from the collection.\nFor each individual valuation one can define its type from the Poincar\u00e9\nseries. From equation (2) it follows that the set of exponents in the Poincar\u00e9\nseries with non-vanishing coefficients generates an abelian group of rank equal\nto the rank of the valuation. The Poincar\u00e9 series of a valuation of type II.1\n(a curve valuation of rank 2) has infinitely many non-vanishing terms with\nexponents from the isolated subgroup of rank 1. This does not take place for\nvaluations of type II.2 (exceptional curve valuations).\nEach series from the ringQ\nZ[[S]] with the free term equal to 1 has a unique\nrepresentation of the form\n(1 \u2212 ta )ka with ka \u2208 Z. (Generally speaking,\na\u2208S\n\nthis product is not finite: infinite number of the exponents ka may be different\nfrom zero.)\nThe Poincar\u00e9 series of rank 1 valuations have the following form.\n1) For a divisorial valuation\n\nP (t) =\n\nh\nQ\n\n\u03b1\n\n(1 \u2212 tm i )\n\ni=1\nh+1\nQ\n\n(1 \u2212\n\n(4)\n\u03b2\ntm i )\n\ni=0\n\nwhere the exponents m\u03b2i generate an infinite cyclic group (i.e. a group isomorphic to Z). Here \u03b1i are rupture points and \u03b2i are dead ends of the dual\ngraph of the minimal resolution.\n2) For a valuation of type II.4 (an irrational one) the Poincar\u00e9 series has\nthe same form 4, but the exponents m\u03b2i generate a free abelian group of rank\n2. (The ratios m\u03b2i /m\u03b20 are rational for i \u2264 h and the ratio m\u03b2h+1 /m\u03b20 is\nirrational.\n3) For a valuation of type II.3 (an infinite valuation) the Poincar\u00e9 series\nhas a representation of the form\n\u221e\nQ\n\n\u03b1\n\n(1 \u2212 tm i )\n\nP (t) = i=1\n\u221e\nQ\n\n\u03b2\n\n(1 \u2212 tm i )\n\ni=0\n\nwith infinitely many factors.\nThis shows that rank 1 valuations of different types cannot have equal\nPoincar\u00e9 series.\nRemark. This also can be deduced from the fact that, for one valuation,\nthe set of exponents with non-zero coefficients coincides with the semigroup of\nvalues of the valuation.\n10\n\n\fFor a collection of divisorial valuations the statement of the Theorem was\nproved in [3]. We shall reduce consideration of a collection of valuations of\ndifferent types to the case of a collection of divisorial valuations. For that we\nshall substitute each non-divisorial valuation from the collection by one or two\ndivisorial ones. In each case the Poincar\u00e9 series of the resulting collection of\nvaluations should be defined by the Poincar\u00e9 series of the initial collection and\nthe dual graph of the minimal resolution of the resulting collection (or rather\nos series of them) should permit to restore the dual graph of the minimal\nresolution of the initial one.\nSuppose that a valuation from the collection {vi } is of type II.1 (a curve\nvaluation of rank 2). Without loss of generality we may assume that this is\nthe first one. Let E\u03c30 be a vertex of the dual graph of the minimal resolution\nof the collection {vi } far enough on the infinite tail corresponding to the valuation v1 . Let us substitute the (rank 2) valuation v1 in the collection {vi }\nby the divisorial valuation v\u03c30 . If one knows the dual graph of the minimal\nresolution of the new collection, one can easily restore the dual graph for the\ninitial one. One can see that the Poincar\u00e9 series of the new collection of valuations is obtained from the Poincar\u00e9 series P{vi } (t1 , . . . , ts ) (see equation (2))\n(0,1)\n(1,0)\nby substituting t1 by t\u03c30 and t1 by tN\n\u03c30 with N large enough.\nSuppose that the valuation v1 is of type II.2 (an exceptional curve valuation), let E\u03c30 be the exceptional curve (a component of the exceptional divisor)\ncorresponding to the valuation, and let P be the corresponding point of the\ncomponent E\u03c30 . (The point P is the intersection point of the component E\u03c30\nwith another component of the exceptional divisor.) Let us make sufficiently\nmany additional blowing-ups at the point P of the component E\u03c30 . (If one\nknows the dual graph of a resolution obtained this way, one can easily restore\nthe dual graph for the minimal one.) In the new resolution, let P be the intersection point of the component E\u03c30 with a component E\u03c30\u2032 . Let us substitute,\nin the collection {vi }, the valuation v1 by two divisorial valuations v\u03c30 and\nv\u03c30\u2032 . One can see that the Poincar\u00e9 series of the new collection of valuations is\n(1,0)\nobtained from the Poincar\u00e9 series P{vi } (t1 , . . . , ts ) by substituting t1\nby t\u03c30\n(0,1)\nand t1 by t\u03c30\u2032 tN\n\u03c30 with N large enough.\nSuppose that v1 is a valuation of type I.3 (an infinite one). Moreover let us\nassume that v1 , v2 , . . . , vr are all valuations of type I.3 in the collection. The\nPoincar\u00e9 series has the form\nn0\nY\n\nl\n\nkn \u2212\u03c7n\n\n(1 \u2212 t )\n\nn=1\n\nHere the product\n\n\u221e\nQ\n\n1\u2212t m\n\n\u03b1j\nr Y\n\u221e\nY\n1 \u2212 tm\n\nl=1 j=1\n\n\u03b1l\nj\n\u03b2l\nj\n\n\u03b2l\nj\n\n.\n\n1 \u2212 tm\n\ncorresponds to the infinite part (tail) of the dual\n\nj=1 1\u2212t m\n\ngraph corresponding to the valuation vl . In these products one has\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nm\u03b11 < m\u03b21 < m\u03b12 < m\u03b22 < . . .\n11\n\n\fl\n\nl\n\nand m\u03b1j \u2192 \u221e, m\u03b2j \u2192 \u221e when j \u2192 \u221e. The distribution of the factors\nbetween these products (from a certain place) is determined by the following\n\u03b2l\n\n\u03b2l\n\nproperty: the ratio mj1j /mj2j strictly increases with j along the tail corresponding to the valuation vj1 (i.e. for l = j1 ), strictly decreases along the tail\ncorresponding to the valuation vj2 (l = j2 ) and is constant along all other tails.\nLet us substitute the infinite valuation v1 by the divisorial valuation v\u03b11N\nwith N large enough. The dual graph of the minimal resolution of the collections {v\u03b11N , v2 , . . . , vs } is obtained from the dual graph of the minimal resolution of the collections {vi } by truncation of the infinite tail corresponding\n1\nto the valuation v1 at the vertex \u03b1N\n. The dual graph of the resolution of the\ncollection {vi } can be restored if one knows the truncated ones for all N large\nenough. The Poincar\u00e9 series of the collection {v\u03b11N , v2 , . . . , vs } is equal to\nn0\nY\n\nl\n\n1\n\nn\n\n(1 \u2212 t k )\u2212\u03c7n\n\nn=1\n\n\u03b1j\n\u03b1j\nN\nr \u221e\nY\n1 \u2212 tm Y Y 1 \u2212 tm\n\nj=1\n\n\u03b21\nj\n\n1 \u2212 tm\n\nl=2 j=1\n\n\u03b2l\nj\n\n.\n\n1 \u2212 tm\n\nSuppose that the valuation v1 is of type II.4 (an irrational one). The semigroup of values of the valuation v1 is generated by 1 = m\u03b21 0 , m\u03b21 1 , m\u03b21 2 , . . . , m\u03b21 h\nwhere m\u03b21 0 < m\u03b21 1 < m\u03b21 2 < . . . < m\u03b21 h , the numbers m\u03b21 i are rational for i < h\nand m\u03b21 h is irrational. Let us substitute the valuation v1 in the collections {vi }\nby the divisorial valuation v\u03c3h far enough in the sequence {\u03c3h } corresponding to\nthe valuation v1 and moreover such that in the dual graph of the minimal resolution of the valuation v1 the component E\u03c3h does not intersect the component\nE\u03c3h+1 (the first among those born by blowing-ups at points of the component\nE\u03c3h ). The dual graph of the resolution of the collection {vi } can be restored\nif one knows the dual graphs of the minimal resolutions of the collections\n{v\u03c3h , v2 , . . . , vs } with all h large enough of the described type.
