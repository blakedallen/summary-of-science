Issues here include whether the index theorem relating gauge field topology and\nfermionic zero modes is well defined. Lattice fermion actions without doublers do illustrate\nthe index theorem nicely. For example, one old-fashioned way to study topology in QCD is\nto use Wilson fermion [1, 2], although it requires fine-tuning of a mass parameter because\nof explicit breaking of chiral symmetry. The overlap fermion [3, 4], which is built on the\nWilson fermion kernel, resolves this problem since it possesses both exact chiral symmetry\nand exact zero modes related to gauge field topology, agreeing with the index theorem\n[5, 6]. The domain wall formalism [7, 8], closely related to the overlap fermion, is also a\nuseful tool to study topological effects in QCD. On the other hand, the index is hidden\nin lattice fermions with species doublers since the index effect cancels between doubling\npairs. Although a theoretical approach to the index of the staggered fermions [9\u201311] were\ndeveloped in [2, 12], it does not give an integer value from the beginning and requires a\nrenormalization depending on the full ensemble of the gauge fields. Thus it is not easy to\ndefine the index theorem in naive, staggered and minimally-doubled fermions and thereby\nstudy topological effects.\nRef. [13] recently presented how to identify the would-be zero modes and their chiralities\nwith staggered fermions away from the continuum limit using the spectral flow of a certain\nHermitean version of the Dirac operator. The integer index obtained here correctly illustrates\nthe gauge topological charge up to a factor coming from tastes. In a sequent paper [14],\nthe author presents a new version of the overlap fermion, the \"staggered overlap fermion\"\nconstructed from the staggered kernel. It is a two-flavor overlap fermion in four dimensions\nand the associated index of exact zero modes illustrates the gauge field topology correctly\nagain. In Ref. [15] the possibility to construct a single-flavor version of the staggered overlap\nfermion is also discussed. The key for theoretical foundation of the index theorem and the\nsequent overlap formalism here is to introduce a taste sensitive mass which is essential\nto reveal the hidden index with the spectral flow of the Hermitean operator. The new\nmass term, which assigns positive and negative masses to tastes depending on their flavorchiralities, removes the cancellation of the index between tastes. When the staggered kernel\nwith this kind of mass is substituted into the overlap formalism, some tastes with positive\n\n\f3\nmass decouple while other tastes with negative mass yield massless modes, which correspond\nto the two-flavor staggered overlap fermion. It is a universal feature for fermions with species\ndoublers that you can obtain the associated overlap fermion with a proper flavored mass\nterm illustrating the correct index.\nOne natural extension of this approach is to apply it to the naive lattice fermion. As\nis well-known, the naive fermion includes 16 species while staggered has 4 species in four\ndimension thus it is expected we can take a parallel process to establish the integer index\ntheorem without renormalization and construct overlap fermion with the naive kernel. However one obstacle in this case is the individual species appear most easily only in momentum\nspace, which leads to difficulty of identifying them as flavors and introducing flavored mass\nterms. We have a similar problem with minimally doubled fermions [11, 16\u201319, 22, 23], where\nthere are two species in momentum space. So far there has been no theoretical foundation\nof the index theorem for naive and minimally doubled fermions [24].\nIn this paper, we successfully identify species in naive and minimally doubled fermions as\nflavors by using the point splitting method, which is proposed in Ref. [20] to define up and\ndown quark fields in minimally doubled fermions. By this identification, we define proper\nflavored mass terms to extract the index in the spectral flow of the associated Hermitean\nversion of the Dirac operator. Here we follow a parallel approach for identifying the wouldbe zero modes and their chiralities to that proposed in the staggered case [13]. Then we\nfind the spectral flow correctly illustrates the index determined by the gauge field topology\nin naive and minimally doubled fermions. In addition we present new versions of overlap\nfermions built from the naive fermion kernel with added flavored mass terms. Especially\nwe construct a single-flavor naive overlap fermion by choosing a certain flavored mass which\nassigns negative mass to one and positive mass to all other species. One good property of this\nfermion over the minimally doubled case is it maintains hypercubic symmetry. Furthermore\nit appears to have more stability of the index against disorder than the Wilson overlap\nfermion. Thus this overlap fermion might be more suitable for practical simulations.\n\nII.\n\nPOINT SPLITTING AND FLAVORED MASS TERMS\n\nWith the d-dimensional naive lattice fermion there are 2d species and the associated\nmassless Dirac operator is anti-Hermitean. These properties are common with the staggered\n\n\f4\nfermion except that there are only 2d/2 tastes in the latter case. Thus it seems easy to\napply the approach for the index of staggered fermion [13] to the naive fermion. In this\nspectral-flow approach the flavored mass term is essential, which gives + and \u2212 masses to\nflavors(species) depending on their chiral charges. However the species in the naive fermion\nappear naturally only in momentum space. Therefore in this case we cannot implement\nflavored mass terms straightforwardly since we need to identify species in momentum space\nas independent flavors. To resolve this problem we apply a method called \"point splitting,\"\noriginally proposed to define up and down quark fields in minimally doubled fermion [20].\nBy using this method we obtain flavored mass terms to give proper Hermitean operators\nfor the spectral flow both in minimally doubled and naive fermions. In this section we first\nintroduce the point splitting for minimally doubled fermions and implement flavored mass\nterms. Secondly we perform the parallel approach for naive fermions.\n\nA.\n\nMinimally doubled action\n\nHere we introduce the point splitting method to obtain flavored mass terms in minimally\ndoubled fermions. We focus only on the Karsten-Wilczek type [16, 17] all through this\npaper. Now we begin with the introduction of minimally doubled fermions. The d = 4\nKarsten-Wilczek action is obtained by introducing a Wilson-like term proportional to i\u03b34 .\nIts position-space expression is\n\" 3\nX 1X\n\u0001\n\u03c8\u0304x \u03b3\u03bc Ux,x+e\u03bc \u03c8x+e\u03bc \u2212 Ux,x\u2212e\u03bc \u03c8x\u2212e\u03bc\nSmd =\n2 \u03bc=1\nx\ni\n+\nsin \u03b1\n\n4\n\n\u0001\n1X\n(cos \u03b1 + 3)\u03c8\u0304x \u03b34 \u03c8x \u2212\n\u03c8\u0304x \u03b34 Ux,x+e\u03bc \u03c8x+e\u03bc + Ux,x\u2212e\u03bc \u03c8x\u2212e\u03bc\n2 \u03bc=1\n\n!#\n\n(1)\n\n\u2020\nwhere the link variables satisfy Uxy = Uyx\n. For the free theory, the associated Dirac operator\n\nin momentum space is given by\n3\nX\n\ni\u03b34\nDmd (p) = i\n\u03b3\u03bc sin p\u03bc +\nsin \u03b1\n\u03bc=1\n\ncos \u03b1 + 3 \u2212\n\n4\nX\n\u03bc=1\n\n!\n\ncos p\u03bc ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the parameter \u03b1 adjusts the relative positions of zeros. It has only two zeros located\nat p = (0, 0, 0, \u00b1\u03b1). These two species are not equivalent since the gamma matrices are\n\ndifferently defined between them as \u03b3\u03bc\u2032 = \u0393\u22121 \u03b3\u03bc \u0393. In the above case the transformation\n\n\f5\nmatrix is given by \u0393 = i\u03b34 \u03b35 . This means the chiral symmetry possessed by this action is\nidentified as a flavored one given by \u03b35 \u2297 \u03c43 .\nThe point splitting identifies these inequivalent species as independent flavors. In this\nmethod each flavor field is defined so that the associated propagator includes only a single\npole. Thus we point-split the original fermion field by multiplying factors removing another\nundesired pole in momentum space,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nsin p4\n1+\n\u03c8(p),\nsin \u03b1\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nsin p4\nd(p + \u03b1e4 ) = \u0393 1 \u2212\n\u03c8(p).\n2\nsin \u03b1\n1\nu(p \u2212 \u03b1e4 ) =\n2\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nHere u(p \u2212 \u03b1e4 ) and d(p + \u03b1e4 ) fields correspond to the poles at p = (0, 0, 0, \u03b1) and\n(0, 0, 0, \u2212\u03b1), respectively. We remark both of them yield single fermionic modes and the\nassociated point-split fields in position space are composed of the original field and the two\nkinds of nearest neighbors [20]. With these flavor fields we obtain a flavor-multiplet field as\nfollowing,\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03a8(p) = \uf8ed\n\nu(p \u2212 \u03b1e4 )\nd(p + \u03b1e4 )\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8.\n\nHere \u03b35 multiplication on the original Dirac field is identified as\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n+\u03b35\n\uf8f8 \u03a8(p) = (\u03b35 \u2297 \u03c43 ) \u03a8(p).\n\u03b35 \u03c8(p) \u2212\u2192 \uf8ed\n\u2212\u03b35\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nHere we introduce a multiplet representation as a direct product of the Pauli matrix to\nexpress the 2-flavor structure. It means the flavored chiral symmetry generated by \u03b35 \u2297 \u03c43\nis exactly preserved in terms of the flavor multiplet while the flavor singlet chiral symmetry\ngiven by \u03b35 \u2297 1 is broken in higher order terms. It is also the case of the staggered fermion\n\n[23].\nNow we can introduce a flavor breaking mass into minimally doubled fermions by a\nparallel approach to the case of staggered fermions in Refs. [13, 14]. We have to choose a\nflavored mass term so that it reveals the hidden index when looking into the spectral flow\nof a certain Hermitean version of the Dirac operator H(m) = \u03b35 (D \u2212 M), which we will\nexplain in detail in Sec. III. (This \u03b35 is regarded as \u03b35 \u2297 \u03c43 in terms of the flavor multiplet\nas shown in (6).) We need to impose that \u03b35 M should be flavor-singlet as \u03b35 M = \u03b35 \u2297 1.\nThus the corresponding flavored mass term here is M = m (1 \u2297 \u03c43 ) with a mass parameter\n\n\f6\nm. To implement this flavored mass term into the action, we rewrite the mass term with\nthe original Dirac field as\n \u0304 + \u03b1e4 ) =\n\u03a8\u0304(p) (1 \u2297 \u03c43 ) \u03a8(p) = \u016bu(p \u2212 \u03b1e4 ) \u2212 dd(p\n\nsin p4\n\u03c8\u0304(p)\u03c8(p).\nsin \u03b1\n\n(7)\n\nIt is straightforward to obtain the mass term in the position space with the link variables\npresent,\nMmd =\n\nm\n\u03c8\u0304x (Ux,x+e4 \u03c8x+e4 \u2212 Ux,x\u2212e4 \u03c8x\u2212e4 ) .\n2i sin \u03b1\n\n(8)\n\nHere we also write a flavor-singlet mass term\n \u0304 + \u03b1e4 ) = 1\n\u03a8\u0304(p) (1 \u2297 1) \u03a8(p) = \u016bu(p \u2212 \u03b1e4 ) + dd(p\n2\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nsin2 p4\n1+\n\u03c8\u0304(p)\u03c8(p),\nsin2 \u03b1\n\n(9)\n\nwhich is not required for the study of the index. The associated massive Dirac operator\nDmd \u2212 Mmd is non-Hermitean, and when gauge fields are present the mass term does not\ncommute with the kinetic term [Dmd , Mmd ] 6= 0. Thus the Dirac operator eigenvalues are\ncomplex. Indeed it is essential for the purpose to detect the index from the spectral flow of\nthe Hermitean operator since it relies on real eigenvalues of the Dirac operator.\nIn Fig. 1 we show a numerical result of complex eigenvalues of the Dirac operator for\nthe d = 2 free case with a parameter \u03b1 = \u03c0/2. Here the low-lying spectrum is split into\ntwo branches crossing the real axis at the magnitude of the mass parameter |m|. It means\nthat the flavored mass \u2212Mmd = diag(\u2212m, +m) assigns \u2212m(+m) to modes depending on\n+1(\u22121) chiral charges, or equivalently +1(\u22121) eigenvalues for 1 \u2297 \u03c43 . In other words the\nflavored mass term splits the minimally doubled fermion into two single Dirac fermions with\n\u2212m and +m as in the staggered case. In Sec. III we will see this flavored mass gives the\nspectral flow of the Hermitean operator illustrating the correct index related to the gauge\ntopology.\n\nB.\n\nNaive action\n\nWe can apply the same approach to the naive lattice fermion [1] to obtain a proper\nflavored mass term.

The Dirac operator has four\nzeros (0, 0), (\u03c0, 0), (0, \u03c0) and (\u03c0, \u03c0) in momentum space, thus we introduce four associated\npoint-split fields\n1\n(1 + cos p1 )(1 + cos p2 )\u0393(1) \u03c8(p),\n4\n1\n\u03c8(2) (p \u2212 p(2) ) = (1 \u2212 cos p1 )(1 + cos p2 )\u0393(2) \u03c8(p),\n4\n1\n\u03c8(3) (p \u2212 p(3) ) = (1 + cos p1 )(1 \u2212 cos p2 )\u0393(3) \u03c8(p),\n4\n1\n\u03c8(4) (p \u2212 p(4) ) = (1 \u2212 cos p1 )(1 \u2212 cos p2 )\u0393(4) \u03c8(p),\n4\n\u03c8(1) (p \u2212 p(1) ) =\n\n(11)\n\nwhose locations of zeros, chiral charges and transformation matrices \u0393 giving the corre(i)\n\nsponding set of gamma matrices, \u03b3\u03bc = \u0393\u2020(i) \u03b3\u03bc \u0393(i) , are listed in Table I.

Therefore the desirable flavored mass\nfor the naive fermion is given by\n\u03a8\u0304(p) (1 \u2297 (\u03c43 \u2297 \u03c43 )) \u03a8(p) = cos p1 cos p2 \u03c8\u0304(p)\u03c8(p).\n\n(14)\n\nPlease note there are also other kinds of flavored mass terms in this case:\n\u03a8\u0304(p) (1 \u2297 (\u03c43 \u2297 1)) \u03a8(p) =\n\n1\ncos p1 (1 + cos2 p2 )\u03c8\u0304(p)\u03c8(p),\n2\n\n1\n\u03a8\u0304(p) (1 \u2297 (1 \u2297 \u03c43 )) \u03a8(p) = (1 + cos2 p1 ) cos p2 \u03c8\u0304(p)\u03c8(p),\n2\n1\n\u03a8\u0304(p) (1 \u2297 (1 \u2297 1)) \u03a8(p) = (1 + cos2 p1 )(1 + cos2 p2 )\u03c8\u0304(p)\u03c8(p).\n4\n\n(15)\n(16)\n(17)\n\nThese varieties are not useful to detect the index via the spectral flow of the Hermitean\noperator. However we will show they are essential when we search for a single-flavor naive\noverlap fermion in Sec. IV. All of these mass terms are spread over several nearby sites, and\ntherefore their position-space expressions include hopping terms with associated gauge field\nmatrices. It is convenient to introduce the usual translation operators T\u00b1\u03bc \u03c8x = Ux,x\u00b1e\u03bc \u03c8x\u00b1e\u03bc\n\n\f9\nand C\u03bc = (T+\u03bc + T\u2212\u03bc )/2. Then the flavored mass for the index (14) is written in the position\nspace as\nM\u03c43 \u2297\u03c43 = m\n\nX\n\nsym.\n\nwhere\n\nP\n\nsym.\n\nC1 C2 \u2261 Mn ,\n\n(18)\n\nstands for symmetric summation over the order of the factors C1 and C2 , and\n\nm stands for a mass parameter. We can also write the extra mass terms in the position\nspace as\n\u0001\nm\u03c43 \u22971 X\n1 + C12 C2 ,\n2 sym.\n\u0001\nm1\u2297\u03c43 X\nC1 1 + C22 ,\nM1\u2297\u03c43 =\n2 sym.\n\u0001\n\u0001\nm1\u22971 X\n1 + C12 1 + C22 .\nM1\u22971 =\n4 sym.\nM\u03c43 \u22971 =\n\n(19)\n(20)\n(21)\n\nHere we comment on the possibility that the two-step hoppings in the same directions would\nbe reduced to zero-step terms with reduction in the effects of gauge field fluctuations.\nNow let us look into the eigenvalues of the d = 2 naive Dirac operator Dn \u2212 Mn with\nthe flavored mass Mn in Eq. (18). In Fig. 2 we show a numerical result of the complex\neigenvalues. Here the low-lying spectrum is again split into two branches crossing the real\naxis at the magnitude of the mass parameter |m|. However in this case both of the two\nbranches are doubled. (We will be convinced of this doubling in Fig. 6 where it is lifted by the\nother mass terms.) It means that the flavored mass term \u2212Mn = diag(\u2212m, +m, +m, \u2212m)\nassigns \u2212m(+m) to modes depending on +1(\u22121) chiral charges, or +1(\u22121) eigenvalues\nfor 1 \u2297 (\u03c43 \u2297 \u03c43 ). Thus the d = 2 naive fermion with 4 species is split into two pairs of\nDirac fermions with \u2212m and +m. In the next section we will show the spectral flow of the\nassociated Hermitean operator gives the correct index related to the gauge topology.\nIn the d = 4 case we can apply the same approach to obtain a proper flavored mass term.\nIn this case there are more possibilities for flavored mass. So we will not discuss details\nhere, and just show the desirable flavored mass term to reveal the index. It is given in the\nmomentum space by\n\u03a8\u0304 (1 \u2297 (\u03c43 \u2297 \u03c43 \u2297 \u03c43 \u2297 \u03c43 )) \u03a8 =\n\n4\nY\n\n\u03bc=1\n\n!\n\ncos p\u03bc \u03c8\u0304\u03c8,\n\n(22)\n\nand in the position space by\nMP = mP\n\n4\nXY\n\nsym. \u03bc=1\n\nC\u03bc .\n\n(23)\n\n\f10\n\nFIG. 2: Complex spectra of non-Hermitean Dirac operator Dn \u2212 M\u03c43 \u2297\u03c43 for the d = 2 free field case\non a 36 \u00d7 36 lattice with mass parameter m = 1.The spectrum is split into two doubled branches\ncrossing the real axis at |m|.\n\nAppendix A is devoted to details of the flavored mass terms in d = 4 naive fermions. In\nFig. 8(a) for the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator we can verify the modes are split into two\n8-degenerate branches, which means the flavored mass decomposes the 4d naive fermions\ninto two pairs with negative and positive masses.\n\nIII.\n\nSPECTRAL FLOW AND THE INDEX THEOREM\n\nIn this section we obtain the integer index related with gauge field topology for the naive\nand minimally doubled fermions. As in the cases of Wilson [5] and staggered fermions\n[13, 14] we utilize the spectral flow of the Hermitean operators with the flavored mass terms\nintroduced in Sec. II. Here the would-be zero modes of the Dirac operators are identified as\nlow-lying crossings of the eigenvalue flow of the Hermitean operators.\nLet us begin with explaining what the spectral flow is. In the continuum field theory\nthe index is defined as the difference between the numbers of zero modes of the massless\nDirac operator with positive and negative chirality, n+ and n\u2212 . The statement of the index\ntheorem is that the index is just equal to a topological charge Q of a background gauge\nconfiguration up to a sign factor depending on its dimensionality,\nn+ \u2212 n\u2212 = (\u22121)d/2 Q.\n\n(24)\n\nHere the question is how to obtain the index of the Dirac operator. We can of course\n\n\f11\ncalculate the zero-mode chiralities straightforwardly, but there is a useful way called spectral\nflow. To introduce it we first introduce a certain Hermitean version of the Dirac operator\nH(m) = \u03b35 (D \u2212 m).\n\n(25)\n\nwhere any zero modes of the Dirac operator with \u00b1 chirality correspond to some eigenmodes\nof this Hermitean operator with eigenvalues \u03bb(m) = \u2213m. If we now consider the flow of the\neigenvalues \u03bb(m) as the mass varies, those corresponding to zero modes will cross the origin\nwith slopes \u22131 depending on their \u00b1 chirality. The non-zero eigenmodes of D, in contrast,\noccur in pairs which are mixed by H and cannot cross zero. Therefore the index of the Dirac\noperator is given by minus the spectral flow of the Hermitean operator, which stands for the\nnet number of eigenvalues crossing the origin, counted with sign \u00b1 depending on the slope.\nThe index with lattice Wilson fermions [5] can similarly be obtained from the spectral\nflow, which in this case means the net number of eigenvalues crossing zero at low-lying values\nof m, counted with signs of the slopes. In the continuum limit, we are only interested in the\ncrossings at small mass; the massive doublers also eventually cross zero, but only for large\nvalues of m. However for lattice fermions with massless species doublers the index cancels\nbetween pairs, so that an eigenvalue flow with a simple mass term does not properly capture\ngauge field topology. This difficulty has been recently resolved by introducing a proper\nflavored (\"tasted\") mass term in staggered fermions [13, 14]. The associated Hermitean\noperator is given by\nHst (m) = \u039355 (Dst \u2212 m\u039355 \u03935 ) = \u039355 Dst \u2212 m\u03935 ,\n\n(26)\n\nwhere \u039355 and \u03935 stand for \u039355 = \u03b35 \u2297 \u03b35 and \u03b35 \u2297 1 with discretization error O(a) in\nterms of a taste multiplet. Indeed it was shown that the index of the staggered fermion is\ngiven by minus the spectral flow of this Hermitean operator. And it was also pointed out\nthat it illustrates correctly the gauge topology up to a integer factor from the number of\ntastes as Index(Dst ) = 2d/2 (\u22121)d/2 Q. Here the spectral flow again means the net number\nof eigenvalues crossing zero at low-lying values of m, counted with signs of the slopes.\nThus the theoretical foundation of the index theorem with staggered fermions is established\nwithout a renormalization depending on the gauge ensemble. Here the mass part in the\nHermitean operator Eq. (26) is approximately proportional to flavor-singlet gamma-5. Note\nwe constructed flavored mass terms for our cases in the previous section following this.\n\n\f12\nNow we can symbolically write a formula for the index as\nIndex(D) = \u2212Spectral flow(H).\n\n(27)\n\nIt is quite natural to consider whether this formula is also available to detect the index of\nminimally doubled and naive fermions with the flavored mass terms we proposed. We will\nfrom now show this spectral flow method can be also applied to these cases. The associated\nHermitean operators for minimally doubled and naive fermions are given by\nHmd (m) = \u03b35 (Dmd \u2212 Mmd ),\n\n(28)\n\nHn (m) = \u03b35 (Dn \u2212 Mn ),\n\n(29)\n\nwhere the matrix \u03b35 is regarded as a flavored one, \u03b35 \u2297\u03c43 for minimally doubled fermions and\n\u03b35 \u2297 (\u03c43 \u2297 \u03c43 ) for two dimensional naive fermions in terms of the flavor multiplet as shown in\nSec. II. The desirable flavored mass terms Mmd and Mn for d = 2 have been already given\nin Eq. (8) and (18). For now we focus on the two dimensional case.\nWe then numerically calculate the eigenvalue flows of two dimensional minimally doubled\nand naive fermions. We consider background configurations proposed in [2] for the staggered\ncase [13]: we start with a smooth U(1) gauge field with topological charge Q,\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 1\n(x2 = 1, 2, * * * , L \u2212 1)\ni\u03c9x2\nUx,x+e1 = e ,\nUx,x+e2 =\n,\n\uf8f3 ei\u03c9Lx1\n(x2 = L)\n\n(30)\n\nwhere L is the lattice size and \u03c9 is the curvature given by \u03c9 = 2\u03c0Q. Then, to emulate\na typical gauge configuration of a practical simulation, we introduce disorder effects to\nlink variables by random phase factors, Ux,y \u2192 eirx,y Ux,y , where rx,y is a random number\nuniformly distributed in [\u2212\u03b4\u03c0, \u03b4\u03c0]. The parameter \u03b4 determines the magnitude of disorder.\nFig. 3(a) shows the eigenvalue flow of the minimally doubled Hermitean operator (28).\nIt is calculated with a Q = 1 and \u03b4 = 0.25 background configuration on a 16 \u00d7 16 lattice.\nThere are two low-lying crossings around m = 0 with positive slopes, which correspond to\nwould-be zero modes. With the formula (27), it means the index of the Dirac operator of\nthe minimally doubled fermion in this case is \u22122. This result is consistent with the index\ntheorem for the minimally doubled fermions given by\nIndex(Dmd ) = 2(\u22121)d/2 Q,\n\n(31)\n\n\f13\n\nFIG. 3: Spectral flows of (a) Minimally doubled and (b) naive Hermitean operators with a Q = 1,\n\u03b4 = 0.25 background configuration on a 16 \u00d7 16 lattice. Two single crossings with positive slopes\nare seen in (a), which means the index is \u22122. Two doubled crossings with positive slopes are seen\nin (b), which means the index is \u22124.\n\nFIG. 4: Spectral flows of (a) Minimally doubled and (b) naive Hermitean operators with a Q = 2,\n\u03b4 = 0.2 background configuration on a 16 \u00d7 16 lattice. Six single crossings with positive slopes\nand two single crossings with negative slopes are seen in (a), which means the index is \u22124. Six\ndoubled crossings with positive slopes and two doubled crossings with negative slopes are seen in\n(b), which means the index is \u22128.\n\nwhich contains a factor 2 reflecting two species. This relation is also satisfied by cases with\nother topological charges, as shown in Fig. 4(a) for the case for Q = 2. Here the net number\nof crossings counted with \u00b1 depending on the slopes is 4. It means the corresponding index\nis \u22124, which is consistent with (31). We also emphasize that there is a clear separation\nbetween low- and high-lying crossings in Fig. 3(a) where low-lying ones are localized about\n\n\f14\nm = 0 and high-lying ones are located at large |m|. Although further numerical study with\nrealistic gauge configurations is required, it indicates the zero modes and the index tend\nto be robust against randomness of the gauge configuration. Now we have established the\nindex theorem with minimally doubled fermions.\nNext results for the naive fermion case are shown in Fig. 3(b). The calculation is done\nwith the same background configuration as the minimally doubled case. Fig. 3(b) shows\nthe eigenvalue flow of the naive Hermitean operator (29). There are two doubled crossings\naround the origin: Here we can verify they are doubled and there totally exist four crossings\nas shown in Fig. 7(a) by introducing other kinds of mass terms given in Sec. II. Again with\nthe formula (27) we obtain the index of the Dirac operator of the naive fermion in this case\nis \u22124. This result satisfies the index theorem for the naive fermion given by\nIndex(Dn ) = 2d (\u22121)d/2 Q,\n\n(32)\n\nwhere it contains a factor 2d reflecting 2d species. This theorem is also satisfied by the\ncases with other topological charges, as shown in Fig. 4(b) for Q = 2. Here the spectral\nflow is 8 since all the crossings are doubled in this case. It means the corresponding index\nis \u22128, which is consistent with (32). There is also large separation between low-lying and\nhigh-lying crossings. It indicates the zero modes and the index tend to be robust as in the\ncase of minimally doubled fermions. Now we have established the index theorem with the\nnaive fermion.\nWe remark both of the Hermitean operators, (28) and (29), satisfy a relation of\n\u03b35 H(m)\u03b35 = \u2212H(\u2212m), reflecting the fact that the original actions have an exact chiral\nsymmetry while the Wilson fermion does not. We can see low-lying and high-lying crossings\nget closer as the randomness effect becomes larger in the both cases, but this original chiral\nsymmetry actually improves the lower bound of H 2(m) satisfying H 2 (m) = D \u2020 D+m2 , which\nenhances the stability of the index against disorder. Thus overlap formalisms with originally chirally symmetric fermions would be more applicable to practical simulations as we\nwill discuss later. In the end of this section, let us comment on d = 4 cases. We can perform\nthe same argument for the 4-dimensional minimally doubled fermions and naive fermions.\nEspecially in the case of the 4d naive fermion, we can show the integer index is obtained\nfrom the spectral flow and it correctly illustrates the topological charge in accordance with\n\n\f15\nEq. (32) by introducing the flavored mass term\nMP = mP\n\n4\nXY\n\nC\u03bc ,\n\n(33)\n\nsym. \u03bc=1\n\nIn Appendix A we will explain this mass term in detail and show the eigenvalues of the\nassociated Dirac operator in Fig. 8(a).\n\nIV.\n\nOVERLAP FORMALISM\n\nIn this section we discuss new versions of overlap fermions constructed from the naive\nand minimally doubled Dirac kernels with the flavored mass terms. The main result here is\nwe obtain a single-flavor overlap fermion with hypercubic symmetry from the naive fermion\nkernel, which may be somewhat simpler than the Wilson overlap fermion.\nFirstly we show the index of exact zero modes of the naive and minimally doubled overlap fermions also illustrate the topological charge correctly. We now introduce minimally\ndoubled and naive versions of overlap Dirac operators,\nHmd\nDmo = 1 + \u03b35 p 2 ,\nHmd\n\nHn\nDno = 1 + \u03b35 p ,\nHn2\n\n(34)\n\nwhere these Hermitean operators have been introduced in (28) and (29). These depend on\nthe mass parameter, which should be chosen in an appropriate region. Then we can obtain\nthe corresponding Ginsparg-Wilson relations\n{\u03b35 , Dmo } = Dmo \u03b35 Dmo ,\n\n{\u03b35 , Dno } = Dno \u03b35 Dno ,\n\n(35)\n\nwhere, as we have discussed, the \u03b35 here can be identified as a flavored one in terms of\nthe flavor multiplet, for example \u03b35 \u2192 \u03b35 \u2297 \u03c43 for the minimally doubled fermion and\n\u03b35 \u2192 \u03b35 \u2297 (\u03c43 \u2297 \u03c43 ) for the d = 2 naive fermion. Note that only half of the original\nflavors(species) with negative mass are converted into physical massless modes in these\noverlap fermions while the others with positive mass become massive and decouple in the\ncontinuum limit. This is because the flavored mass terms we introduced assign negative\nmass to half of species and positive mass to the others. Thus there is only a single physical\nmode for the minimally doubled overlap fermion in any dimensions while there are 2d /2\nphysical modes in d-dimensional naive overlap fermions. Here the 2d /2 massless modes in\nthe naive overlap fermion have the same chiral charge, or equivalently the same eigenvalue\n\n\f16\nfor the \"flavor-chirality\" matrix given by 1 \u2297 (\u03c43 \u2297 \u03c43 ) in the d = 2 case. As a consequence,\nthe flavored Ginsparg-Wilson relations in (35) reduce to unflavored relations for massless\nmodes as in the staggered case [14].\nThis reduction of flavored degrees also affects the index of the Dirac operators. We can\nobtain the indices of the minimally doubled and naive overlap Dirac operators from the\nGinsparg-Wilson relations (35),\n1\nIndex(Dmo ) = \u2212 Tr\n2\n\nHmd\np\n2\nHmd\n\n!\n\n,\n\n1\nIndex(Dno ) = \u2212 Tr\n2\n\nHn\np\nHn2\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(36)\n\nNow we can easily calculate these quantities analytically: The main part of the above equa\u221a\ntions is a sign function as H/ H 2 = sgn(H). Thus the trace of this operator Tr (sgn(H))\ngives the difference between the number of positive and negative eigenvalues at some value\nof the mass parameter. It is essential to fix the mass parameter between low- and high-lying\ncrossings in the eigenvalue flows of Hmd and Hn . Then the index of the above overlap Dirac\noperator becomes just a half of that of the original Dirac operator,\n1\nIndex (Dmo ) = Index (Dmd ) ,\n2\n\n1\nIndex (Dno ) = Index (Dn ) .\n2\n\n(37)\n\nThis relation relies on the property of the Hermitean operator \u03b35 H(m)\u03b35 = \u2212H(\u2212m), as\ndiscussed in the end of Sec. III. This is also the case with the staggered overlap case.\nAs shown here, we can construct a single-flavor overlap fermion from minimally doubled\nfermions, which however lacks enough discrete symmetry for a simple continuum limit [18,\n19]. On the other hand, the naive overlap fermion includes lots of flavors (8 for d = 4)\nalthough it possess hypercubic symmetry. Now we will proceed to obtain a single-flavor\noverlap fermion from the naive fermion kernel by choosing a proper mass term. The key is\nto utilize the extra flavored mass terms given in Eqs. (19)(20).\nFor the purpose of constructing a single flavor naive overlap fermion with the hypercubic\nsymmetry, we make use of the fact that only species(flavors) with negative mass lead to\nmassless modes in the overlap formalism. It means if we introduce a flavored mass term to\nassign negative mass to one flavor and positive or zero mass to other flavors we can derive\na single-flavor naive overlap fermion. For example, in the case of the 2d naive fermion with\nthe original flavored mass (18), there are two degenerate species with negative mass. Now\nwe need to lift this degeneracy by adding other kinds of flavored mass terms. From now we\nfocus on the 2d case for a while. Now we have two possibilities of flavored mass terms to lift\n\n\f17\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Hopping terms included in naive flavored mass terms: (a) isotropic ones,\nM\u03c43 \u2297\u03c43 (blue) and M1\u22971 (red), and (b) anisotropic ones, M\u03c43 \u22971 (orange) and M1\u2297\u03c43 (green).\n\nthe degeneracy\n\u0001\nm\u03c43 \u22971 X\n1 + C12 C2 ,\n2 sym.\n\u0001\nm1\u2297\u03c43 X\n=\nC1 1 + C22 ,\n2 sym.\n\nM\u03c43 \u22971 =\n\n(38)\n\nM1\u2297\u03c43\n\n(39)\n\nwhich have been already shown in Eqs.

Here we do not consider the mass term of\nM1\u22971 because it just gives an overall shift of the spectrum.\nThere is a criterion about how to add these mass terms to the original one M\u03c43 \u2297\u03c43 (18)\nwith preserving the hypercubic symmetry. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the extra mass terms\nM1\u2297\u03c43 and M\u03c43 \u22971 stand for anisotropic hoppings in position space. And the only way to\nhold hypercubic symmetry is add them with the same coefficient to the original one M\u03c43 \u2297\u03c43 ,\nwhich has isotropic hoppings as shown in Fig. 5(a). Thus the possible form of the flavored\nmass to give single negative mass to the naive fermion is given by\n\u2212 Mn (c) = \u2212M\u03c43 \u2297\u03c43 \u2212 c (M\u03c43 \u22971 + M1\u2297\u03c43 ) .\n\n(40)\n\nwhere c is an overall coefficient of the two extra mass terms and we take account of the\nconvention D \u2212 M. Then we find the simplest case c = 1 leads to single negative mass as\nfollowing,\n\u2212 Mn (c = 1) = diag(\u22123, 1, 1, 1) \u2261 \u2212M\u0303n .\n\n(41)\n\n\f18\n\nFIG. 6: Complex spectra of the naive Dirac operators for the d = 2 free field case on a 36 \u00d7 36\nlattice: (a) c = 0.2, (b) c = 0.5 and (c) c = 1. In (a) the doubled negative branch is lifted and one\nof them goes to the positive direction. In (b) this branch enters a positive range. In (c) it coincides\nwith the positive branch.\n\nThis assigns only one negative mass to the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator Dn \u2212 M\u0303n . Figure\n6(c) shows there is a single negative branch and a tripled positive branch. This means there\nis only one flavor with negative mass. We also depict figures for c = 0.2 in Fig. 6(a) and\nc = 0.5 in Fig. 6(b) to convince you that one of the branch is singled out and the others are\ntripled. It describes the situation that the doubled negative branch is split and one branch\ngoes towards the the positive branch. Then for the case of c \u223c 0.5 this branch enters a\npositive range. Thus it is clear that the negative branch with c = 1 is singled out and the\npositive one should be triply degenerate.\nNow we find one example of the single-flavor naive overlap operator as following,\nD\u0303no = 1 + q\n\nDn \u2212 r M\u0303n\n\n.\n\n(42)\n\n(Dn \u2212 r M\u0303n )\u2020 (Dn \u2212 r M\u0303n )\n\nwhere we introduce an overall mass parameter r. Here we also study the spectral flow of the\nHermitean operator with this mass term. Indeed it gives us a consistency check between the\nnumber of flavors and the index: Now we have a single flavor overlap fermion (42), thus the\nassociated index should be exactly equal to minus the topological charge without a flavor\nfactor in this dimension. The eigenvalue flow of the naive Hermitean operator with c = 0.2,\nc = 0.5 and c = 1 for Q = 1 are depicted in Fig. 7. It is obvious that the doubled flows\nare separated in the case of c = 0.2, and we find two of the four flows no longer cross zeros\nfor c = 0.5. Thus only two crossings remain in the case of c = 1. As we have discussed in\nEq. (36), the index of the overlap version is given by minus half difference of positive and\n\n\f19\n\nFIG. 7: Spectral flows of the d = 2 naive Hermitean operators with a Q = 1, \u03b4 = 0.25 background\nconfiguration on a 16 \u00d7 16 lattice: (a) c = 0.2, (b) c = 0.5 and (c) c = 1. The doubled flows are\nlifted in (a). Two of the four flows no longer cross zeros in (b). The two single crossings are shown\nin (c).\n\nnegative eigenvalues of the Hermitean version of the original Dirac operator at some mass\nparameter. It means if you take an overall mass parameter r in Eq. (42) between low and\nhigh-lying crossings, the index of exact zero modes of the d = 2 naive overlap fermion (42)\nwith c = 1 is given by \u22121 for Q = 1. It generally means\n\u0010\n\u0011\nIndex D\u0303no = \u2212Q,\n\n(43)\n\nwhich is a quarter of the original index of the 4-species naive fermion and there is no flavor\nfactor. We can also check this formula for other topological charges. Thus we checked the\nconsistency with the index. In the extension to general dimensions the theorem is given by\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n(44)\nIndex D\u0303no = d Index (Dn ) = (\u22121)d/2 Q.\n2\nNow we can also follow same approach in 4 dimensions, which is slightly more complicated.\n\nHere we do not show details but just present the flavored mass to give only one negative\nmass with preserving hypercubic symmetry,\nMP + MT + MV + MA ,\n\n(45)\n\n\f20\nwhere the meaning of each mass term is shown in Appendix. A. In Fig. 8(c) the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator with this mass term are depicted. Here the negative branch is\nnon-degenerate and the positive one is 15-fold degenerate. The associated overlap fermion\nproduces only one massless mode. Thus the associated overlap form is a 4d single-flavored\nnaive overlap fermion with hypercubic symmetry. You can also verify that this 4d version\nalso satisfies the theorem in Eq. (44).\nIn the end of this section, let us comment on the symmetries and practical issues of\nthis fermion. As long as the hopping symmetry of the mass terms is concerned in Fig. 5,\nhypercubic symmetry is maintained. Thus, unlike the minimally doubled case, we do not\nneed to fine-tune additional parameters for the continuum limit. Regarding the numerical\nspeed, it should be computationally comparable to the Wilson overlap. Furthermore the\nnaive overlap fermion we proposed may have stability of the index against disorder due to\nthe original chiral symmetry, although we should also take account of large fluctuations\nand renormalization effects in the realistic gauge configurations due to non-nearest hopping\nterms [26]. Now we have three examples for overlap varieties: Wilson, Staggered and Naive.\nWhich is the best among them is an open question.\n\nV.\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn this paper we have shown how the index theorem is realized in naive and minimally\ndoubled fermions by considering the spectral flow of the Hermitean version of Dirac operators. The key is to make use of a point splitting for flavored mass terms. We also\npresented a new version of overlap fermions composed from the naive fermion kernel, which\nis single-flavored and maintains the hypercubic symmetry essential for a good continuum\nlimit.\nIn Sec. II we introduce the point-splitting method to identify species in momentum space\nas flavors. By using this method, we succeed to define the proper flavored mass terms in minimally doubled and naive fermions. In Sec. III we study the spectral flow of the Hermitean\noperators in these fermions. Then it is shown that the spectral flow correctly illustrates\nthe integer index determined by gauge field topology both in naive and minimally doubled\nfermions up to overall integer factors reflecting the number of species. In Sec. IV we study\nnew versions of overlap fermions composed from these fermion kernels with flavored mass\n\n\f21\nterms. These fermions satisfy Ginsparg-Wilson relations instead of usual chiral symmetry.\nWe show the topological charge can be also obtained as the index of exact zero modes of\nthe naive and minimally doubled overlap fermions. Then we show by choosing the flavored\nmass term so that only one of species has negative mass, the associated overlap fermion\nproduces one massless fermionic mode. This single-flavor naive overlap fermion should possess the hypercubic symmetry and other properties possessed by the original naive fermion.\nFurthermore it may possess more stability for the index against disorder than Wilson overlap fermion since the naive fermion originally has chiral symmetry. However we also need\nto consider potential large fluctuations and renormalization effects in the realistic gauge\nconfigurations. Thus further investigation is required to show whether this type of overlap\nfermions has advantages for practical simulations over the Wilson overlap fermion.\nIn the end of this paper, let us discuss realistic possibility to use this \"Naive Overlap\nfermion\". Compared to Wilson overlap fermion, this one begins with only a simple kinetic\nterm, or just a \"naive action\". Once you fix a flavored mass term such as the one we have\nshown, to simulate QCD with this fermion may be easier than with the Wilson overlap. On\nthe other hand, the staggered overlap fermion is based on one-component fermionic filed\nper site while our formulation uses four-component fields. This means staggered overlap\nfermion is likely to be somewhat better than the naive overlap in terms of numerical expense.\nHowever, to fully answer to this question we need more detailed numerical research.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nMC is grateful to the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation for support for visits to\nthe University of Mainz.

In this representation the chiral transformation matrix \u03b35\nis converted to \u03b35 \u2297 (\u03c43 \u2297 \u03c43 \u2297 \u03c43 \u2297 \u03c43 ), under which the naive action is invariant. Here the\nV-type includes 4 varieties while the T-type has 6 varieties and the A-type 4 varieties, giving\nthen the total number as 16. Each of these varieties breaks the hypercubic symmetry of the\nlattice since their hoppings are anisotropic. Thus we need to take a proper combination of\nthem in order to construct a flavored mass term with hypercubic symmetry. For example\nwe consider the sum of the 4 varieties with the same ratios for the V-type as in the case of\nd = 2. It is also the case with the T- and A-types. Thus the 5 types of flavored masses with\nthe symmetry in terms of the original fermion field are given by\nMS =\n\n4\n\u0001\nmS X Y\n2\n1\n+\nC\n,\n\u03bc\n24 sym. \u03bc=1\n\nY\n\u0001\nmV X X\n2\nC\n1\n+\nC\n,\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\n23 perm. sym.\n\u03bd(6=\u03bc)\nX\nX\n\u0001\n\u0001\nmT\nMT = 2\nC\u03bc C\u03bd 1 + C\u03c12 1 + C\u03c32 ,\n2 perm. sym.\n\u0001 Y\nmA X X\n1 + C\u03bc2\nC\u03bd ,\nMA =\n2 perm. sym.\nMV =\n\n(A3)\n(A4)\n(A5)\n(A6)\n\n\u03bd(6=\u03bc)\n\nMP = mP\n\n4\nXY\n\nsym. \u03bc=1\n\nC\u03bc ,\n\n(A7)\n\n\f25\n\nFIG. 8: Complex spectra of non-Hermitean Dirac operators for the d = 4 free field case in momentum space with 164 grids of the brillouin zone.

(c)\nDn \u2212 (MP + MV + MT + MA ).\n\nwhere\n\nP\n\nperm.\n\nmeans summation over permutations of the space-time indices.\n\nNow we derive the flavored mass terms required to detect the index from the spectral\nflow of the Hermitean operator. As in the d = 2 case, it should be constructed so that the\nassociated Hermitean operator has a flavor-singlet mass part as \u03b35 M \u223c \u03b35 \u2297 (1 \u2297 1 \u2297 1 \u2297 1).\nSuch a mass term is just the P-type mass (A7). Thus the flavored mass term for the\nHermitean operator is given by\nMP = mP\n\n4\nXY\n\nC\u03bc .\n\n(A8)\n\nsym. \u03bc=1\n\nWith the Hermitean operator Hn = \u03b35 (Dn \u2212 MP ), we reveal the index theorem with the\nnaive fermion as in the d = 2 case. Here we only show the figure for eigenvalues of the free\nDirac operator Dn \u2212 MP in Fig. 8(a). The mass term splits the modes into two branches,\nwhich are 8 fold degenerate. If we introduce other types of mass terms, the degeneracy is\nlifted as seen in Fig. 8(b).\nNext we show the flavored mass term to yield a single-flavor naive overlap fermion in 4d.\nAs in the case of 2d there are some possibilities to realize it. The simplest example of the\nmass term to yield a single-flavor naive overlap fermion with hypercubic symmetry is given\nby\nMP + MV + MT + MA .\n\n(A9)\n\nThe eigenvalues of the Dirac operator with this mass term is depicted in Fig. 8(c). Here\n\n\f26\nthe negative branch is single and the positive one is 15 fold degenerate. It means the\nassociated overlap fermion produces only one massless mode. Furthermore, as seen from\nthe construction, it should possess hypercubic symmetry. Thus it could be a useful fermion\naction for lattice QCD simulation.\nWe now comment on some connections with other works. The P-type mass term actually\nQ\ncorresponds to the modified gamma matrix \u03935 = ( 4\u03bc=1 cos p\u03bc )\u03b35 , which is introduced in\nRef. [25] to study the effects of topological charge with the 4d naive fermion. In some sense\n\nwe have given its theoretical foundation by the point-splitting method. It is also similar to\n\u03935 \u223c \u03b35 \u2297 1 of the staggered fermions [23]. Regarding the T-type masses, they are similar\nto the flavored mass terms for the single-flavor staggered overlap fermion proposed in [15].\nThese similarities are reasonable since the staggered fermions can be obtained from the naive\nfermions [11].\n\n[1] K.
