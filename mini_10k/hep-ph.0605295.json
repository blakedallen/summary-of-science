Reno\nDepartment of Physics and Astronomy, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa 52242 USA\nElectromagnetic structure functions for electron-proton scattering are used as a test of the QCD\nimproved parton model at low and moderate Q2 . Two parameterizations which work well in ep\nscattering at low Q2 are used to evaluate the inelastic muon neutrino-nucleon and muon antineutrinonucleon cross sections for energies between 1-10 GeV, of interest in long baseline neutrino oscillation\nexperiments. Cross sections are reduced when these low-Q2 extrapolations are used.\n\narXiv:hep-ph/0605295v1 26 May 2006\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nNeutrino physics has been a topic of considerable interest, especially since the discovery of neutrino oscillations\n[1] in the context of solar neutrinos [2] and atmospheric\nneutrinos [3]. Determinations of neutrino mass squared\ndifferences and mixing angles have led to long baseline\nneutrino experiments [4] where the energies of the neutrino beams range between a few hundred MeV to tens\nof GeV. In the few GeV region, it is a theoretical challenge to describe the neutrino-nucleon cross section with\nhigh precision [5]. Theoretical issues include the problem\nof making the transition between exclusive and inclusive\ncalculations, and the fact that one is generally in a Q2\nregime where the coupling constant \u03b1s (Q2 ) is large.\nCurrently, experimental data in this kinematic region\nfor neutrino scattering are sparse [6], although experiments are planned to remedy this situation [7, 8]. Theoretical work has started to address the issue of combining\nexclusive and inclusive processes in Ref. [9]. One element\nof the calculation is the deep inelastic scattering (DIS)\ncontribution, which is the focus of this paper. We assess the perturbative QCD description of the electroweak\nstructure functions in the kinematic regime relevant to\nthe neutrino cross section at a few GeV incident energy.\nWe do this by considering the electron-proton electromagnetic structure functions where there are extensive\ndata [10]. The breakdown of the perturbative description occurs at a Q2 scale of Q2 \u223c 1 GeV2 when one\ncompares electromagnetic scattering data with structure\nfunction calculations. In electromagnetic scattering, below \u223c 1 GeV2 , phenomenological parameterizations can\nbe used in place of the parton model based evaluations\nof the structure functions.\nThere are parameterizations of the structure functions\nover the full range of x and Q that successfully describe\nthe electromagnetic data [11, 12], however, it is not completely obvious how to generalize these parameterizations\nto the neutrino scattering case. Bodek, Yang and Park\n[13, 14] have taken a different approach, namely to extract flavor components of structure functions even in the\nnonperturbative regime [15]. This is explicitly applicable to neutrino scattering. Here, we examine a structure\nfunction parameterization by Capella et al. [16, 17] which\ndoes well in electron-proton scattering at low values of\nQ2 and at the same time has a straightforward transformation to neutrino charged current scattering. The\n\nparameterizations of Capella et al., and by Bodek, Yang\nand Park are described and compared below.\nIn the next section, we show the results of a perturbative evaluation of the DIS charged current cross section\nin the intermediate (few GeV to 10 GeV) energy range to\nestablish which kinematic regions contribute most to the\ncross section. In Section III, we use ep scattering results\nto show the range of validity of perturbative QCD and the\nefficacy of the two phenomenological parameterizations of\nthe structure functions into the non-perturbative regime.\nSection IV shows how the extrapolations translate to the\nstructure functions relevant to neutrino scattering. Comparisons of the different approaches to low Q2 structure\nfunctions in neutrino-nucleon charged current cross sections are shown in Sec. V.\nII.\n\nDIS IN \u03bdN SCATTERING\n\nOf particular interest is the neutrino cross section for\nenergies up to 10-20 GeV. One approach [5] to the cross\nsection in this energy regime is to add three separate contributions to the cross section: the (quasi)elastic weak\nscattering contribution which leaves the nucleon intact\n[18], the resonant contribution in which a finite number\nof resonances including the \u2206 are included [19], and the\ninelastic contribution to sum the remaining terms [20].\nTo avoid double counting, the evaluation of the inelastic\npiece is done over a restricted phase space. Generally,\nsomething like a limit on the hadronic final state invari2\nant mass W , such W 2 > Wmin\n\u223c 2 GeV2 , is applied. We\nuse Wmin to separate the exclusive and inclusive calculations, and we focus only on the inclusive portion of the\ncross section.\nAs Lipari, Lusignoli and Sartogo emphasized [5], the\ncharged current cross section components for \u03bd\u03bc N scattering from quasi-elastic, \u2206 resonance production, and\ndeep inelastic scattering (DIS) with W 2 > 2 GeV2 are\nabout equal for E\u03bd \u223c 2 GeV. The DIS term grows with\nincreasing energy.\n\"Deep\" inelastic scattering is a misnomer in this case\nbecause of the sensitivity to the cross section to low-Q2 .\nNeutrino-isoscalar nucleon scattering\n\u03bd\u03bc (k) N (p) \u2192 \u03bc(k \u2032 ) X\nis discussed in terms of q = k \u2212 k \u2032 , Q2 \u2261 \u2212q 2 \u2265 0,\nthe invariant momentum transfer to the hadronic system,\n\n\f2\n\n2\nFIG. 1: Minimum value of Q2 such that W 2 > Wmin\n= 1, 2\nand 4 GeV2 .\n\n2\n\nand x \u2261 Q /(2p*q).

Fig. 1 shows the minimum values\n2\nof Q2 such that W 2 > Wmin\n= 1, 2 and 4 GeV2 . The\n2\ncontribution of the low-Q kinematic region to the DIS\nneutrino cross section is the focus of this paper.\nThe neutrino differential cross section can be written\nin terms of structure functions Fi as\n\"\n\u03bd\nG2F M E\u03bd\nd2 \u03c3CC\n(\u03bdN )\n2 T MC\n=\n2 )2 xy F1\ndx dy\n\u03c0(1 + Q2 /MW\n!\nM xy\n+ 1\u2212y\u2212\nF2T MC\n2E\u03bd\n#\n!\nxy 2\nT MC\n+ xy \u2212\n(2)\nF3\n2\nwhen the outgoing lepton mass is neglected. The full expression including lepton masses is found in Ref. [21], for\nexample. Here, we assume \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u0304\u03bc scattering and include the muon mass in our evaluation. The label of TMC\nindicates that target mass corrections can be incorporated into the structure functions [22, 23], both through\nthe Nachtmann variable\n2x\n\u03be =\n(3)\n2\nQ (1 + \u03c1)\n2 2\n\u03c1 = (1 + 4MN\nx /Q2 )1/2 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwith nucleon mass dependent factors multiplying the\nasymptotic structure functions and with convolutions of\nthe asymptotic structure functions.\n\nFIG. 2: E\u03bd = 5 GeV including NLO QCD corrections and\ntarget mass corrections.\n\nAt leading order in QCD, neglecting target mass corrections and for values of Q large enough that the parton\nmodel makes sense, the structure functions are schematically\nF2 (x, Q2 ) = 2xF1 (x, Q2 )\nX\n\u0001\n=\n2x q(x, Q2 ) + q\u0304(x, Q2 )\nX\n\u0001\nF3 (x, Q2 ) =\n2 q(x, Q2 ) \u2212 q\u0304(x, Q2 ) .\n\n(5)\n\nOnly the relevant quarks and antiquarks are included\nabove, and Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing angles\nmust be included as well. The full expressions, including NLO corrections, target mass corrections and charm\nmass corrections appear, e.g., in Ref. [20].\nQCD corrections reduce the DIS cross section by about\n10% for E\u03bd = 5 \u2212 10 GeV [20, 21]. The evaluation of the\ncross section at these energies relies on an extrapolation\nof the parton distribution functions to low Q. The parton\ndistribution functions are typically not defined below a\nminimum factorization scale Q20 . We set the PDF scale at\nQ2 = Q20 for Q2 < Q20 and include the O(\u03b1s ) correction\naccounting for the mismatch of factorization scale with\nthe scale Q. Fig. 2 shows the ratio of the charged current\nneutrino-nucleon cross section as a function of minimum\nQ2 normalized to the total cross section for E\u03bd = 5 GeV\n2\nfor two similar choices of Wmin\n\u223c 2 GeV2 . Approximately half the cross section at this energy comes from\nQ2 < 1 GeV2 . At higher energies, the fraction reduces,\ne.g. to \u223c 30% at E\u03bd = 10 GeV.\nThe importance of Q2 < 1 GeV2 in Fig. 2 leads us\nto consider structure functions at fixed values of Q for\na range of x relevant to low energy neutrino scattering.\nWe focus on F2 at Q2 = 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 4 GeV2 . At Q2 =\n4 GeV2 , we are firmly in the perturbative QCD regime,\nand at the low end of Q2 we are definitely out of the\nperturbative regime. The range of x at fixed Q2 is limited\n2\non the upper end by Wmin\nas shown in Fig. 1. The\nlower limit on x is determined by the incident neutrino\n\n\f3\nenergy: x \u2265 Q2 /(2M E\u03bd ). Given the plethora of data in\nelectromagnetic scattering, we turn to ep scattering to\ntest the perturbative evaluation of the electromagnetic\nstructure function F2 and to consider alternatives.\n\nIII.\n\nep SCATTERING\n\nElectron-proton scattering in the perturbative regime\nis well described by the parton model. The structure\nfunction F2 at leading order, neglecting target mass corrections, is written in terms of quark (and antiquark) distribution functions q(x, Q2 ) with electric charge q = ei e:\nF2 (x, Q2 ) =\n\nX\ni\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\ne2i q(x, Q2 ) + q\u0304(x, Q2 ) .\n\n(6)\n\nAs discussed above, the parton distribution functions are\nextrapolated below the minimum factorization scale Q20\nin the perturbative parton model evaluation.\nStructure functions calculated in this manner can be\ncompared with ep electromagnetic scattering data. For\nease of comparison, we primarily use the parameterization of Abramowicz, Levin, Levy and Maor [11] which\nuses 23 parameters to describe a wide range of data. In\nFig. 3 we show the ALLM parameterization (solid line),\nalong with NLO QCD (dashed) evaluated using the Martin et al. parton distribution functions [24] MRST2004.\nThe data points come from SLAC ep scattering data [25]\nfor Q2 = 3.7 \u2212 4.3 GeV2 .\nAlso in shown in Fig. 3 are boxes indicating the relevant range of x for Q2 = 4 GeV2 . The vertical line\nfurthest left is xmin for E\u03bd = 10 GeV, while the next vertical line is xmin for E\u03bd = 5 GeV. The third vertical line\n2\nshows xmax for Wmin\n= 4 GeV2 . At larger x is the max2\nimum for Wmin = 2 GeV2 . The perturbative calculation\nmatches the ALLM parameterization and the data well.\nFor comparison, we show the same curves for Q2 =\n0.5 GeV2 along with data from E665 [26] in Fig. 4. The\ndata are for Q2 = 0.43, 0.59 GeV2 . The pertubative\nevaluation of F2 overestimates the ALLM parameterization. On the basis of the discrepancy between ep data\nand the perturbative curves, we conclude that the low\nenergy \u03bdN DIS cross section is overestimated by the perturbative expression.\nTwo other phenomenological parameterizations of electromagnetic structure functions are discussed here. The\nfirst is by Capella, Kaidalov, Merino and Thanh Van\n(CKMT) [16] and the second is the Bodek-Yang-Park\nparameterization [13, 14].\n\nFIG. 3: F2 (x, Q2 ) for ep electromagnetic scattering for Q2 = 4\nGeV, with the ALLM parameterization (solid), NLO QCD\n(dashed) evaluated using the MRST2004.

The\nquantities B and f are calculated by requiring two valence u quarks and one valence d quark. This assumes\nthat the first term (proportional to A) has no valence\ncontent. B is the coefficient of the up valence component, and f is the ratio of the down valence to up valence\ncoefficients.\nThe quantities n(Q2 ) and \u2206(Q2 ) are parameterized by\nCKMT according to the form\n!\n2\n3\nQ\nn(Q2 ) =\n1+ 2\n,\n(8)\n2\nQ +c\n!\n2Q2\n2\n\u2206(Q ) = \u22060 1 + 2\n.\n(9)\nQ +d\nValues of the parameters from Ref. [16] appear in Table\n1.\nThe quantity \u22060 \u2243 0.08 represents the power law of F2\ngoverned by pomeron exchange at low Q2 [27]. This is\nthe same power law that appears in the generalized vector meson dominance (GVDM) approach [28, 29]. The\nQ2 dependent prefactor, however, has the same form as\nthe continuum contribution rather than the vector meson\ncontribution. Alwall and Ingelman [30] have taken the\nGVDM approach together with valence parton density\nfunctions based on a model accounting involving quantum fluctuations to consider ep scattering at low-Q2 . We\ntake the more phenomenological CKMT approach to parameterizing F2 in part because it is relatively straightforward to convert to \u03bdN structure functions.\nA comparison of the ALLM parameterization and the\nCKMT parameterization of F2 for electromagnetic scattering at Q2 = 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 4 GeV2 is shown in Fig.\n5.\nB.\n\nBodek-Yang-Park Parameterization\n\nA second parameterization has been performed by\nBodek and Yang [13], joined by Park [14]. A generalized\nNachtman variable \u03bew is used, along with form factors\n\nFIG. 5: F2 (x, Q2 ) for electromagnetic scattering with the\nALLM parameterization (solid), and the CKMT parameterization (dashed).\n\nand the Gluck, Reya and Vogt parton distribution functions (GRV98) [31]so that the structure function F2 is\nwritten as\nX\nF2 (x, Q2 ) \u2261\ne2q \u03bew (q\u0303(\u03bew , Q2 ) \u0303q\u0304 (\u03bew , Q2 ) .\n(10)\n\nThe PDFs q\u0303 are related to the usual PDFs by form factor\nrescaling. Details are given in the appendix.\nThis approach is specifically designed to be used with\nneutrino scattering. One feature of the Bodek-Yang-Park\n(BYP) analysis is the separation of the quark and antiquark flavors. The flavor separated components of F2\nare then used to evaluate neutrino charged current interactions. To address the question of how universal the\nBYP parameterizations of effective quark distributions\nare, we will compare the BYP approach to evaluating the\n\u03bdN cross section with the CKMT parameterization. A\ncomparison of these two cross section results will give an\nestimate of the uncertainty in the \u03bdN DIS cross section\ncomponent. Ultimately, measurements in this kinematic\nregime are required.\nIV.\n\nSTRUCTURE FUNCTIONS IN NEUTRINO\nSCATTERING\n\nThe evaluation of the neutrino structure functions using the BYP parameterization are straightforward using\nX\n2\u03bew (q\u0303(\u03bew , Q2 ) \u0303q\u0304 (\u03bew , Q2 ) .\n(11)\nF2 (x, Q2 ) \u2261\nThe CKMT parameterization was fit specifically to ep\nscattering data, however, with the interpretation of the\nseparate sea and valence terms, it can be modified to\napply to neutrino scattering. Here we consider only\nisoscalar nucleons N , the average of proton plus neutron\ntargets.\n\n\f5\nThe modification of Eq. (7) will be done only for three\nparameters: A, B and f will be replaced by A\u03bd , B\u03bd and\nf\u03bd [17]. The rationale is that the small x and large x\nstructure functions in electromagnetic and charged current scattering should show the same qualitative behavior\nas a function of Q2 . At large x, the balance between valence up and down quarks is different in electromagnetic\nand charged current scattering, however, the coefficients\nB and f are calculable. Qualitatively, for small-x, the\nstructure functions are sea dominated. Again, the mix of\nsea components is changed, but the assumption is that\neach sea component has qualitatively the same behavior\nin x and Q2 , so only A changes.\nOne caveat to this approach is that at Q2 = 0, PCAC\nrequires a modification of the functional form of the parameterization [32]. Neither the BYP nor the CKMT\nparameterization currently accommodates this theoretical behavior. Nevertheless, the small x, small Q2 data\nfrom neutrino scattering are accommodated. For example, the CCFR data [33] for x = 0.008, 0.0125, 0.0175 for\nQ2 = 0.4 \u2212 0.9 GeV2 are within \u223c 10% of the CKMT\nparameterization with neutrino modifications discussed\nbelow.\nThe modifications to Eq. (7) are the following. We\ncalculate that for neutrino scattering B \u2192 B\u03bd = 2.695\nand f\u03bd = 0.595. By evaluating F2 at Q2 = 10 GeV2 ,\nwe choose A \u2192 A\u03bd = 0.60 so that it matches the NLOTMC corrected F2 reasonably well. This gives A\u03bd /A = 4,\nwhich is what one would estimate by counting sea quarks\nand antiquarks contributing to each process, weighting s\nquarks and antiquarks by a factor of 1/2.\nFig. 6 shows a comparison of F2 calculated using\nGRV98 PDFS at NLO in QCD with target mass corrections (solid line) and the Bodek-Yang-Park parameterization, both at Q2 = 4 GeV2 . The two evaluations\nof F2 agree well at this value of Q2 . At lower Q2 , the\nperturbative evaluation is larger than the BYP parameterization, for example, by about 30% at x = 0.1 and\nQ2 = 1 GeV2 .\nFig. 7 shows the charged current F2 using the modified\nCKMT (dashed lines) and the BYP (solid lines) parameterizations for several values of Q2 . The parameterizations give similar results except for the lowest value of\nQ2 in the large x region, and for the smallest x values.\nCross sections require F1 and F3 as well as F2 . For\nthe CKMT parameterization of F3 , we start with the\nvalence term and add a strange quark component equal\nto 1/15 of the total sea contribution in F2 . To achieve\na better large x agreement with perturbative QCD, the\nstructure function has an overall normalization factor of\n0.91. This factor makes the valence component integrate\nto 2.73 at Q2 = 2 GeV2 , consistent with measurements\n[10] of the Gross-Llewellyn-Smith sum rule[35] including\nQCD corrections. To summarize, we take for neutrino\nscattering\nF3 (x, Q2 ) =\n\n\"\n\n2\nA\u03bd \u2212\u2206(Q2 )\nQ2\nx\n(1 \u2212 x)n(Q )+4\n15\nQ2 + a\n\nFIG. 6: Neutrino-isoscalar nucleon F2 at Q2 = 4 GeV2 for\ncharged current scattering, solid line for NLO QCD with\nTMC, dashed line from Bodek-Yang-Park parameterization\nusing GRV98.\n\nFIG. 7: Neutrino-isoscalar nucleon F2 at Q2 = 0.1, 0.5, 1\nand 4 GeV2 for charged current scattering, solid line for\nthe Bodek-Yang-Park parameterization using GRV98 and the\ndashed line for the modified CKMT parameterization with\nA\u03bd = 0.60, B\u03bd = 2.695 and f = 0.595.\n\n1\u2212\u03b1R\n\n+ B\u03bd x\n\u00d7\n\n\u0010\n\nn(Q2 )\n\n(1 \u2212 x)\n\nQ2\n2\nQ +b\n\n!\u03b1R\n\n#\n\u0011\n1 + f\u03bd (1 \u2212 x) /(1.1x) .\n\n(12)\n\nF1 is obtained from F2 by including the correction for\nR 6= 0 where\n!\n4M 2 x2\nF2\n\u22121 .\n(13)\n1+\nR=\n!1+\u2206(Q2 )\n2xF1\nQ2\nWe use the parameterization of Whitlow et al.\n\nin\n\n\f6\nRef. [25], which is also consistent with neutrino scattering data [36]. The parameterization applies for Q2 >\nQ2m = 0.3 GeV2 . Below Q2 = Q2m , we take R(x, Q2 ) =\nR(x, Q2m ) * Q2 /Q2m .\nWe note that similar results for the structure functions\nare obtained by rescaling the NLO+TMC in a manner\nsimilar to Eq. (7), e.g., below the scale Q2c ,\n\u016b(\u03be, Q2 ) = \u016b(\u03be, Q2c ) * F2sea (x, Q2 )/F2sea (x, Q2c )\n\n(14)\n\nand similarly for the valence distributions. The gluon\ndistribution must be rescaled according to the \"sea\" factor.\nV.\n\nNEUTRINO-NUCLEON CROSS SECTION\n\nThe neutrino cross section with isoscalar nucleon targets is calculated using Eq. (2). For the results labeled by\nthe low-Q2 parameterization, we use the full NLO QCD\ncorrected structure functions including target mass corrections for Q2 > Q2c = 4 GeV2 . Below Q2c , we use either\nthe BYP or CKMT parameterizations of the nonperturbative region. For the energies considered here, below 10\nGeV, the results are not very sensitive to the cutoff Qc .\nAt the lowest energies, the nonperturbative parameterization is relatively more important, however, the cross\nsections are small.\nResults labeled with NLO+TMC, as in previous sections, used the next-to-leading order QCD corrected\nstructure functions, with parton distribution functions\nfrozen at the minimum value provided by the parameterization. For this section, all NLO+TMC results used the\nGRV98 PDFs with a minimum Q2 = 0.8 GeV2 .\nIn Fig. 8 we show the neutrino-nucleon charged current cross section normalized by incident neutrino energy, where the cross section have been evaluated using\nNLO+TMC (upper lines) and using the CKMT and BYP\nparameterizations below Q2c = 4 GeV2 (lower lines) for\n2\nWmin\n= 4 GeV2 (solid) and 2 GeV2 (dashed). The dotted lines show the cross sections calculated using leading\norder QCD including target mass correction. Numerical\nvalues corresponding to this figure are shown in Table II.\nThe corresponding results for antineutrino-nucleon scattering are shown in Fig. 9 and Table III.\nThe low Q2 corrections reduce the cross sections even\n2\n= 2 GeV2 for neutrinos, the\nat E\u03bd = 10 GeV. For Wmin\nreduction is by 7-8% at 10 GeV, and 11-13% at 5 GeV.\n2\n= 4 GeV2 the reducFor neutrino scattering with Wmin\ntion ranges from 6-7% to 10-15% for the same energies.\nAntineutrino scattering cross sections are more dramatically affected. The cross sections are reduced by of order\n20% for E\u03bd\u0304 = 10 GeV, and between 25-43% depending on\n2\nfor 5 GeV incident antineutrinos. The sensitivity\nWmin\nto the value of Q2c is greater, a few percent, at E\u03bd\u0304 = 10\nGeV.\nThe agreement between the cross sections calculated\nwith the CKMT and BYP parameterizations gives some\nconfidence in the predictions for the DIS component of\n\nFIG. 8: Neutrino-isoscalar nucleon cross sections normalized\n2\nto incident neutrino energy: solid lines for Wmin\n= 4 GeV 2\n2\n2\nand dashed lines for Wmin = 2 GeV . The upper solid and\ndashed lines use NLO QCD plus target mass corrections to\nevaluate the cross section, while the lower solid and dashed\nlines use the CKMT and BYP parameterizations below Q2 =\n4 GeV2 . The dotted lines show the evaluation using leading\norder QCD plus target mass corrections.\n\nthe neutrino-nucleon cross section at a few GeV in energy. This is one step in developing the comprehensive\ncalculation of the neutrino cross section required for interpreting the oscillation measurements at present and in\nthe future.\nAppendix\nThe form of the Bodek-Yang-Park parameterization\n[13, 14] used in this paper relies on parameterizations\nof the form\nF2 (x, Q2 ) \u2261\n\nX\n\ne2q \u03bew q\u0303(\u03bew , Q2 )\n\n(15)\n\nwhere q\u0303(\u03bew , Q2 ) depends on rescaled Gluck, Reya and\nVogt PDFs [31] in terms of a modified Nachtman variable\n\u03bew .
