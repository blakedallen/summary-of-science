The superconducting (SC) state can\nbe achieved either by electron or by hole doping of the\nparent compounds, leading to a suppression of the SDW\nformation.6,16\u201318 The suppression of the magnetic transition in connection with the simultaneous formation of\na SC state is reminiscent of cuprates and heavy fermion\nsystems, therefore suggesting that the SC state in these\nsystems is unconventional as well.\nEuFe2 As2 is a particularly interesting member of the\niron arsenide AFe2 As2 ('122') family, since the A site is\noccupied by a Eu2+ S -state (orbital moment L=0) rareearth ion with a 4f 7 electronic configuration with a total\nelectron spin S =7/2, corresponding to a theoretical effective magnetic moment of 7.94 \u03bcB . Figure 1 shows the\ncrystal structure of EuFe2 As2 . This compound is built\nup by [FeAs]2\u2212 layers, seperated by layers of magnetic\nEu2+ ions. EuFe2 As2 exhibits both a SDW ordering of\nthe Fe moments and an antiferromagnetic ordering of the\nlocalized Eu2+ moments below 190 K and 19 K, respectively. The presence of magnetic phase transitions at\n19 K and 190 K in EuFe2 As2 was seen by M\u00f6ssbauer\n\nspectroscopy19 and is confirmed by neutron diffraction.20\nIn contrast to the other '122' systems, where the substitution of Fe by Co leads to superconductivity,21,22 the compounds containing Eu2+ exhibit the onset of a superconducting transition but seem to be hindered to reach zero\nresistivity at ambient pressure.23 Reentrant superconducting behavior was also observed in a EuFe2 As2 crystal\nunder applied pressure up to 2.5 GPa.24,25 Only above 2.8\nGPa a sharp resistive transition to a zero-resistivity state\nis achieved.25 Bulk superconductivity is also observed in\nEuFe2 As2\u2212x Px ,26,27 where isovalent P-substitution of the\nAs-site acts as chemical pressure on EuFe2 As2 . No superconductivity was detected in EuFe2\u2212x Nix As2 ,28 while\nsuperconductivity with a maximum Tc ' 20 K was reported for BaFe2\u2212x Nix As2 .29 It was suggested from different experiments28,30\u201332 that there is a strong coupling\nbetween the localized Eu2+ spins and the conduction\nelectrons of the two-dimensional (2D) Fe2 As2 layers. The\nstudy of the interaction between the rare-earth Eu2+\nmagnetic moments and the conducting Fe2 As2 layers is\nimportant in order to understand why it is difficult to\ninduce superconductivity in Co-doped EuFe2\u2212x Cox As2 .\nIn order to investigate the coupling between the Eu\nand Fe1.9 Co0.1 As2 layers as well as to study the magnetic transitions in EuFe1.9 Co0.1 As2 , a combination of\nX-ray diffraction, magnetization, and 75 As nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments were performed on\nsingle crystals. Magnetic susceptibility as well as 75 AsNMR measurements reveal a decrease of the SDW transition temperature to TSDW =120 K for EuFe1.9 Co0.1 As2 .\nIt was found that the 75 As NMR spectra are characterized by a negative frequency shift with respect to the\n75\nAs-NMR Larmor frequency. This shift is significantly\nlarger than the one observed in AFe2 As2 (A=Ba, Ca,\nSr).33\u201336 The temperature dependence of the shift follows\na Curie-Weiss type behavior with a Curie-Weiss tempera-\n\n\f2\nof the delay time between the exciting and the refocusing\npulse.\n\nEu\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nFe\n\nA.\n\nSingle crystal X-ray diffraction\n\nAs\n\nFIG. 1:\n(Color online) Tetragonal crystal structure of\nEuFe2 As2 at room temperature, consisting of [Fe2 As2 ]2\u2212 layers separated by Eu2+ layers.\n\nture close to the one determined from the magnetization\ndata. The estimate of the hyperfine coupling constant\nbetween the 75 As nuclei and the Eu 4f states suggests\na strong coupling between the Eu2+ magnetic moments\nand the Fe1.9 Co0.1 As2 layers.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\n\nSingle crystals of EuFe1.9 Co0.1 As2 were grown out\nof Sn flux. The chemical composition of the single crystals was determined on freshly cleaved samples using wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy\n(WDS). The obtained composition corresponds to the\nformula EuFe1.9 Co0.1 As2 within the experimental error (\u00b1 5 %). X-ray diffraction was performed on a\nsingle crystal of a size of approximately 0.2 x 0.1 x\n0.008 mm3 using a Bruker diffractometer equipped with\nthe APEX II CCD detector (Bruker ASX). The data\nwere analyzed using the APEX237 and SAINT38 software. The susceptibility measurements of the crystals\nEuFe1.9 Co0.1 As2 were carried out with a SQUID magnetometer (QuantumDesign) in the temperature range\nfrom 5 to 300 K in a magnetic field of 0.3 T applied parallel (H k c) and perpendicular (H \u22a5 c) to the crystallographic c-axis. The 75 As-NMR experiments on a single\ncrystal (dimensions: 4 x 4 x 0.2 mm3 ) from the same\nbatch were performed in an external magnetic field of 9\nT using a standard pulse spectrometer. NMR-echo signals were recorded with a frequency selective echo pulse\nsequence applying a phase-alternating add-subtract accumulation technique. The 75 As-NMR spectra were obtained by scanning the frequency in discrete steps and\nintegrating the spin-echo signal, yielding the 'spin-echo\nintensity'. The spin-spin relaxation time T2 was determined by measuring the spin-echo intensity as a function\n\nX-ray diffraction experiments at room temperature\nrevealed a good quality of the EuFe1.9 Co0.1 As2 crystal.\nThe average mosaic spread was estimated to be ' 0.9\u25e6 .\nThe lattice constants for the tetragonal unit cell based\nupon the refinement of 689 reflections are a = b =\n3.9104(1) \u00c5, c = 11.9434(3) \u00c5, V = 182.629(8) \u00c53 . The\naverage residual for symmetry equivalent reflections is\nRint = 4.63 % and R\u03c3 = 4.01 %. The structure was\nsolved with XS39 and subsequent structure refinements\nwere performed with XL.40 Because of the almost equal\nnumber of electrons, Co and Fe atoms were considered as\none atom. The final anisotropic full-matrix least-squares\nrefinement on F0 2 with 8 variables converged at R1\n= 2.70 %. Further details of the structure refinement\nare shown in Table I. No additional phases (impurities, twins, or intergrowing crystals) were detected\nby examination of the reconstructed reciprocal space\n\nTABLE I: Crystallographic and structure refinement parameters of the single crystal EuFe1.9 Co0.1 As2 .

Therefore, one can expect that the\nintralayer arrangment of the Eu2+ spins is ferromagnetic\nas in the parent compound EuFe2 As2 . A clear drop in\nthe susceptibility at the SDW transition temperature\nwas observed in BaFe2 As2 .14 In the case of EuFe2 As2\nthe large signal from the Eu2+ spins makes it impossible\nto directly observe the SDW anomaly. However, after\nsubtracting the Curie-Weiss contribution \u03c7\u22a5CW (T )\nfrom \u03c7\u22a5 (T ), a small anomaly in \u03c7\u22a5res (T )=\u03c7\u22a5 (T ) \u03c7\u22a5CW (T ) is visible at around 120 K (Fig. 3b). This\nbehavior resembles that observed in EuFe2 As2 42 and\nBaFe2 As2 14 which was ascribed to the SDW transition\nof the Fe moments.\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) The reconstructed hk0 reciprocal space\nsection of the single crystal EuFe1.9 Co0.1 As2 .\n\n1 2 0\nN\n\n= 1 5 K\n\n(a )\n\n1 .5\n\n9 0\n\n1 .0\n\n6 0\n\n0 .0\n0\n\n\u03c7\u22a5CW (T ) =\n\nC\n.\nT +\u0398\n\n(1)\n\nHere C denotes the Curie-Weiss constant, and \u0398 the\nWeiss temperature.

The\ntemperature dependence of the inverse susceptibility for\nH \u22a5 c is also shown. Below 30 K, \u03c7 increases sharply,\nindicating ferromagnetic coupling between the Eu2+ moments. Below 15 K, a sudden decrease in the magnetic\nsusceptibility for H \u22a5 c (\u03c7\u22a5 ) can be seen, indicative for\na transition to the antiferromagnetic state of the Eu2+\nmoments. On the other hand, the magnetic susceptibility\nfor H k c (\u03c7k ) remains almost constant below 15 K. This\nsuggests that the Eu2+ moments align in the ab-plane,41\nsimilar as in the case of EuFe2 As2 .20 From 50 K to 120\nK, \u03c7\u22a5 is well described by the Curie-Weiss law:\n\nm o l/m\n\n0\n\nMagnetic Properties\n\nS D W\n\n\uf063\n\nB.\n\n-1\n\n3 0\n\n\u03c7\u22a5 ( 1 0\n\n0 .5\n\n4\n\nH \u22a5c\nH || c\n\u03bc0 H = 0 . 3 T\n\n-4\n\nm\n\n3\n\n3\n\n)\n\n/m o l)\n\nT\n\n\u03c7||, \u22a5 ( 1 0\n\nsections measured at room temperature (Fig. 2).

The nuclear spin Hamiltonian describing the interactions of the investigated nucleus with\nthe external magnetic field and the crystal electric field\ngradient at the nuclear site is given by the expression:\nH = \u03b3~(1 + K\u03b1 )I\u03b1 H0 +\n\n6[(3Iz2\n\nh\u03bdQ\n.

We use the standard convention Vxx \u2264 Vyy \u2264 Vzz . Since the principal axis of the\nEFG tensor as well as the magnetic shift tensor are defined by the symmetry of the nuclear site, the resonance\nfrequency of a particular nuclear transition depends on\nthe field direction relative to the crystalline axes.\nIn the absence of a static magnetic field, the remaining\nterm gives rise to double degenerate energy levels, between which nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) transitions can be induced. 75 As has a nuclear spin I = 23 and\nthus two double degenerate \u00b1 12 and \u00b1 32 energy levels.\nIn the presence of a large external magnetic field H0 a\nsplitting of the 75 As spectrum into a central line, arising\nfrom the central transition (+ 12 ,- 12 ) and two satellite lines\ndue to the (\u00b1 12 ,\u00b1 32 ) transitions occurs. A representative\n75\nAs NMR spectrum of the central transition at 295 K is\nshown in the inset of Fig. 4. In the paramagnetic state\n(T > TSDW ) lines with a full width at half maximum\n(FWHH) of about 250 kHz (central line) and 500 kHz\n(satellite lines) are observed. Figure 4 presents the dependence of the 75 As-NMR central line position on the\nangle \u03b8 between the magnetic field orientation and the\nc-axis at 261 K (tetragonal phase). For all orientations\nof the magnetic field with respect to the c-axis the line\npositions show a strong negative shift relative to the corresponding 75 As Larmor frequency of 65.9 MHz at 9 T.\n75\nAs has four nearest neighbor Fe atoms, and lies just\nabove or below the Fe plane (see Fig. 1). In the tetragonal phase its site symmetry requires uniaxial symmetry\nalong the c axis for the EFG tensor(\u03b7 = 0) and the K\ntensor.

The solid line is a guide to the eye. Solid\nsquares represent the calculated frequencies as described in\nthe text. The inset illustrates the 75 As NMR central line\nshape at 295 K. The solid line represents a Gaussian fit.\n\nthe Hamiltonian [Eq. (2)] yields Kab = -0.0372(2), Kc =\n-0.0456(3), and \u03bdQ = 7.39(24) MHz with \u03b7 set to be zero.\nFigure 5a shows the temperature dependence of the\nspin-spin relaxation rate 1/T2 of the central line of the\n75\nAs NMR spectrum for H k c. 1/T2 exhibits a CurieWeiss-like temperature dependence down to 120 K. This\nshows that the 75 As nuclei interact with the localized Eu4f moments. A reduction of 1/T2 is observed at 120 K,\nwhich reflects the slowing down of the Fe spin fluctuations\ndue to the SDW ordering of the Fe moments. A similar\nbehavior across the SDW transition was also reported for\nspin-lattice relaxation measurements in AFe2 As2 (A=Ba,\nCa, Sr).33\u201335 However, in contrast to these findings, in\nour case 1/T2 increases again upon further cooling. This\nincrease reflects the dominant Eu2+ contribution in the\nspin-spin relaxation process. The SDW transition below 120 K is also reflected in the temperature dependence of the NMR linewidth as shown in Fig. 5b. In\naddition, we observed a so-called wipeout phenomenon\nof the central line intensity with decreasing the temperature across the SDW transition. The temperature dependence of the wipeout fraction, defined as F = [A1 (295 K)\n- A1 (T)]/A1 (295 K) is displayed in the inset of Fig. 5b.\nThe wipeout fraction is a measure for an unobserved signal intensity,43,44 A1 =I * T, where I represents the NMR\necho intensity, corrected for the T2 echo decay and integrated over the full central line. A sudden increase in the\nwipeout fraction and a pronounced broadening (Fig. 5b)\nof the 75 As central line can be clearly seen below 120 K.\nThe decrease of 1/T2 , the pronounced broadening of the\n75\nAs central line, and the sudden jump of the wipeout\nfraction are caused by the appearance of inhomogeneous\n\n\f5\n\nH || c\n1 /T\n8\n\nis well described by a Curie-Weiss like behavior for both\ndirections of the magnetic field H :\n\n(a )\n2\n\nK(T ) = K0 +\n\nCK\n.\nT +\u0398\n\n(4)\n\n-1\n\n\u03bcs )\n\nC u rie -W e is s la w\n\n1 /T\n\n2\n\n(1 0\n\n-2\n\n6\n\n4\n\n1 0 0\n\n1 5 0\n\n2 0 0\n\n2 5 0\n\n3 0 0\n\n3\n\nH || c\n0 .4\n\n1 6\n\n0 .0\n1 0 0\n\n1 5 0\n\n2 0 0\n\n2 5 0\n\n1 5 0\n\n1 8 0\nT (K )\n\n- K ||, \u22a5 ( % )\n\n2 1 0\n\n0 .3\n\n\uf020 \uf020\n\n\uf071\n\n(a )\n\n\u22a5c\n\n= - 1 8 .9 K\n\n0 .2\n\n1 2\n\n2\n1 2 0\n\nH\n\nH \u22a5c\n\n3 0 0\n\nT (K )\n\n9 0\n\n0 .4\n\u22a5\n\nlin e w id th (1 0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n(b )\n\nH || c\n\n0 .8\n\n-1 /K\n\nk H z )\n\nH || c\n\nw ip e o u t fra c tio n (F )\n\nT (K )\n\n5\n\nThe inset of Fig. 6a presents the inverse of the temperature dependent part of the shift for H \u22a5 c as a function\nof temperature. Below the SDW transition TSDW = 120\nK the data deviates from the Curie-Weiss behavior. This\ndeviation can be understood when considering that above\nTSDW both the Eu and Fe sublattices are in the paramagnetic state, and both contribute to the shift, while below\nTSDW only the Eu2+ moments contribute. An analysis\nof the data for H \u22a5 c using Eq. (4) yields: \u0398 = -18.9(9)\nK, K0 = 0.17(25) %.

Since for this temperature\nrange \u03bdQ is almost constant, as it will be shown below\nand \u03b7 is very close to zero, the observed temperature dependence of the central line frequency is fully determined\nby the temperature behavior of K. In Fig. 6a we present\nthe temperature dependence of the shift K in the temperature range from 100 and 300 K for H k c (Kk =Kc ) and\nH \u22a5 c (K\u22a5 =Kab ). Compared to the magnetic shift data\nfor AFe2 As2 (A=Ba, Ca, Sr),33\u201336 our observed shifts\nare significantly larger, negative, and show a completely\ndifferent temperature dependence.

Fig. 6b shows K\u22a5 versus \u03c7\u22a5 with the temperature as an implicit parameter.\nFrom the linear fit of this data we can estimate a hyperfine coupling constant AEu = -1.9\u00d7107 A/m per \u03bcB .\nThis value of A is almost 60 times larger than the one\nreported for NdFeAsO0.85 F0.15 .45 It is known that the\n'1111' compounds are more anisotropic than the '122'\ncompounds.46 Therefore, the '1111' systems are treated\nas quasi two-dimensional, while the '122' systems are regarded as three dimensional systems. Moreover, the distance between the rare-earth ion Eu2+ and the conduction layers in EuFe1.9 Co0.1 As2 is d = c/2 = 5.9713(3)\n\u00c5, which is much smaller than in NdFeAsO0.85 F0.15 (d\n= 8.577 \u00c5).45 The smaller interlayer distance in the\n'122' compounds as compared to the '1111' system and\nthe more isotropic band structure may be the reason\nfor the much stronger hyperfine coupling in the '122'\ncompound. The large value of hyperfine coupling constant, quantitatively determined from the present NMR\nexperiment, provides direct experimental evidence for a\nstrong coupling between the Eu2+ localized moments and\nthe Fe1.9 Co0.1 As2 layers. This suggests that the magnetic exchange interaction between the localized Eu 4f\nmoments is mediated by the itinerant Fe 3d electrons,\ni.e., via a Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) type\nof mechanism19,28 leading to a high magnetic ordering\ntemperature of the Eu2+ moments in EuFe2 As2 . It\nwas shown that Co-substitution induces superconductivity in EuFe2\u2212x Cox As2 with a reentrant behavior of\nresistivity due to the antiferromagnetic ordering of the\nEu2+ spins.23 Reentrant superconducting behavior was\nalso observed in a EuFe2 As2 crystal under an applied\npressure up to 2.5 GPa.24,25 Moreover, while superconductivity with a maximum Tc = 20 K has been reported for BaFe2\u2212x Nix As2 ,29 no superconductivity was\nobserved in EuFe2\u2212x Nix As2 .28 The strong interaction between the localized Eu2+ moments and charge carriers\nin the Fe2\u2212x Cox As2 layers may cause pair breaking according to the Abrikosov-Gorkov theory,47 which may be\nthe reason why it is difficult to get superconductivity in\nEuFe2\u2212x Cox As2 .\nFinally, we would like to discuss the temperature de-\n\n6 6 .8\n6 6 .4\n\n(a )\nlo w e r s a te llite\nH \u22a5c\ns p in - e c h o in te n s ity ( a .u .)\n\nAEu\n\u03c7Eu\ngNA \u03bcB\n\nre s o n a n c e fre q u e n c y (M H z )\n\nKEu =\n\npendence of the resonance frequency and the skewness\nof a 75 As lower-satellite line for H \u22a5 c (see Fig. 7).\nA Change in the slope of the temperature dependence\nof the satellite line frequency can be seen at 225 K as\nshown in Fig. 7a. The inset of Fig. 7a illustrates a typical 75 As-NMR spectrum of the low-frequency satellite\nat 263 K. The spectra exhibit an asymmetric lineshape\nin the investigated temperature range. We analyzed the\nasymmetry of the satellite line shape at different temperatures by calculating its skewness (see Fig. 7b), defined as the third standartized moment. With decreasing temperature the skewness exhibits an increase down\nto 225 K, where it starts to reduce again. The slope\nchange in the temperature dependence of the frequency\nof the 75 As lower-satellite line as well as the maximum\nin the temperature evolution of the skewness may be related to the appearence of a electronic nematic phase\nbelow 225 K in EuFe1.9 Co0.1 As2 . Note that evidence for\nan electron nematic phase transition was recently established in undoped AFe2 As2 (A=Ba, Ca)48 and Co-doped\nBaFe2\u2212x Cox As2 49 single crystals by means of in-plane\nanisotropy measurements of the electrical resistivity.\nIn order to get more quantitative NMR results for a\npossible nematic phase, the angular dependence of the\nfull 75 As NMR spectrum (central line and both satellite\n\n6 6 .0\n6 5 .6\n6 5 .2\n1 .0\n\n1 .6\n\nH \u22a5c\n\nT = 2 6 3 K\n\n1 .2\n0 .8\n0 .4\n0 .0\n6 6 .0\n\n(b )\n\n6 6 .4\n6 6 .8\n6 7 .2\nF re q u e n c y (M H z )\n\n6 7 .6\n\n0 .8\n\nS k e w n e s s\n\nthe magnetic susceptibility measurements. This suggests\nthat the Curie-Weiss part of the shift arises from the hyperfine coupling between the 75 As nuclei and the Eu2+\n4f moments. The remaining constant part of the shift\nK0 could be related to the coupling of 75 As with the\nitinerant 3d electrons in the Fe2 As2 layer, including an\norbital shift. However, the value of K0 is a factor two\nsmaller than the total 75 As magnetic shift reported for\nBaFe1.8 Co0.2 As2 .36 The contribution of Eu to the magnetic shift KEu can be related to the susceptibility \u03c7Eu\nof the localized Eu 4f moments as follows:\n\n0 .6\n0 .4\n0 .2\n0 .0\n\n1 8 0\n\n2 1 0\n\n2 4 0\n\n2 7 0\n\n3 0 0\n\nT (K )\nFIG. 7: (Color online) Temperature dependence of the frequency (a) and the skewness (b) of the 75 As lower-satellite\nline for H \u22a5 c.

The dominant contribution\nto the magnetic shift stems from the Eu2+ 4f moments\n(see above), and it is acceptable to assume that this contribution does not have a strong ab-anisotropy. Therefore, we reduced the parameter set to Ka = Kb = Kab ,\nKc , \u03bdQ , and \u03b7. Analysis of the angular dependence of\nthe full spectrum using the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian [Eq. (2)] yields Kab = -0.059(1), Kc = 0.069(2),\n\u03bdQ = 7.51(17) MHz, and \u03b7 = 0.04(3). The change in\n\u03bdQ compared to the value \u03bdQ = 7.39(24) MHz obtained\nat 261 K in the tetragonal phase is small. The slight\nincrease of \u03b7 may reflect the lower symmetry of the As\nsite in a possible nematic phase. However, further experiments are needed to clarify the presence of a nematic\nphase in EuFe1.9 Co0.1 As2 . Resistivity measurements on\ndetwinned50 single crystals could provide more information by probing the in-plane electronic anisotropy.\n\nD.\n\nimplying that the 75 As nuclei interact with the localized\nEu 4f moments in the Eu layer. A large value of the\nhyperfine coupling constant between the 75 As nuclei and\nthe Eu 4f moments suggests a strong coupling between\nthe Eu and Fe1.9 Co0.1 As2 layers. Due to such a strong\ninterlayer coupling the antiferromagnetic interaction\nbetween the localized Eu2+ 4f moments is probably mediated by a Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)\ntype interaction. Evidence for a SDW transition at 120\nK was obtained from magnetic susceptibility as well\nas from 75 As-NMR measurements. A change of the\nslope in the temperature dependence of the frequency\nof the 75 As lower-satellite line is observed at 225 K. In\naddition, at the same temperature also a maximum in\nthe temperature behavior of the skewness is detected.\nThese findings may indicate a phase transition to an\nelectron nematic state below 225 K.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nIV.\n\nIn\nsummary,\nthe\nmagnetic\nproperties\nof\nEuFe1.9 Co0.1 As2 single crystal were investigated by\nX-ray diffraction, magnetization, and 75 As NMR experiments.
