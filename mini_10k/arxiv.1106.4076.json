The ACA Correlator processes four pairs of dual polarization signals, whose\nbandwidth is 2 GHz, from up to sixteen antennas, and calculates auto- and\ncross-correlation spectra including cross-polarization in all combinations of sixteen antennas. We report the detailed design of the correlator and the verification\nresults of the correlator hardware.\n\n1.\n\nALMA and ACA Correlator\n\nALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array) consists of fifty 12-m antennas and \"Atacama Compact Array (ACA)\" (Iguchi et al. 2009). The ACA antennas are\ncomposed of four 12-m antennas for total power observation and twelve 7-m antennas for\nshort-baseline interferometer. The ACA Correlator proforms the processing of astronomical\nsignals from all the ACA antennas.\n\n2.\n\nCorrelator Design and Requirements\n\nAstronomical correlator calculates correlation coefficients between the signals from antennas, and it has a function to arbitrarily change the integration time and frequency resolution to get the data to be handled easily. It also provides information on frequency\n1\n\nNational Astronomical Observatory of Japan, 2-21-1 Osawa, Mitaka, Tokyo 181-8588, Japan\n\n2\n\nNagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, 464-8601, Japan\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nspectral profiles. The newly developed ACA Correlator adopts \"FX\" architecture, in which\nthe Fourier transform is performed before a cross multiplication. ALMA is a general-purpose\nmillimeter and submillimeter telescope which can observe all kinds of astronomical objects in\nthe range of its angular resolution. There are many scientific goals, and sensitivity, frequency\nresolution, and frequency coverage are key factors to achieve the various scientific goals.\nIn ALMA, the quantization loss is required to be smaller than 12 %, which is the\nvalue of 2-bit quantization, by performing quantization with 3-bit 4Gsps. To achieve this\nrequirement, ACA Correlator processes the digital signals of 3-bit 4Gsps without reducing\nthe number of bits. In addition, the correlator is designed to achieve high spectral dynamic\nrange of 10000 : 1. The ACA Correlator also supports wide variety of flexible spectral\nconfigurations (combinations of frequency resolution and coverage) for observations which\nspan from wide continuum emission to high-resolution maser emissions. Major specifications\nof the ACA Correlator performance are listed in Table 1.\n\n3.\n\nCorrelator Hardware\n\nThe ACA Correlator was installed in the room of Array Operation Site Technical Building at an altitude of approximately 5000 meters (Figure 1). The correlator processes 8baseband signals from 16 antennas with 8 racks. Each two racks perform all the necessary\nprocesses for one pair of dual polarization signals, and they are composed of three kinds of\nbox-like modules. Also, module structure can be easily replaced by a few persons at the high\nsite from the viewpoints of operability and maintainability.\n\n4.\n\nVerification of the ACA Correlator\n\nWe have performed verification tests of design and implementation for the scientific\nfunction, stability, and performance of the ACA Correlator.\n\n4.1.\n\nFunction test using known signal data\n\nThe output of calculated results from the ACA Correlator were checked to be bitaccurately coincident with our developed simulator using known input data, for various sets\nof correlator configurations. Figure 2 demonstrates an example of verification tests of ACA\nCorrelator using known data.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n4.2.\n\nLong-term integration tests of analog noise\n\nWe conducted long-term integration test of analog noise in order to verify the performance of ACA Correlator. In this test, we verified the following two items by inputting 1-bit\ndigitized thermal noise to the correlator and integrating the cross-correlation products for 8\nhours:\n\u2022 There is no harmful sporadic event caused by digital processing\n\u221a\n\u2022 Noise level decrease in proportion to 1/ integration time\nFigure 3 shows this test results, which confirm the two verification items; The left plot clearly\nshows there is no artificial pattern caused by digital processing, and for the right plot it can\n\u221a\nbe clearly seen that the noise level decreases in proportion to 1/ integration time.\n\n4.3.\n\nSignal receiving and data processing from ALMA antennas\n\nWe also conducted the test of receiving signals from ALMA antennas and data processing\nat Array Operation Site (AOS), and verified that the ACA Correlator successfully received\nthe signals and processed the digitized data without any problems (Figure 4).\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] Iguchi, S. et al. 2009, PASJ, Vol. 61, pp. 1-12\n\nThis preprint was prepared with the AAS LATEX macros v5.2.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n\nTable 1: Major specifications of the ACA Correlator\nFunction\nSpecification\nNumber of antennas\n16\nNumber of inputs per antenna\n4 baseband \u00d7 2 polarizations = 8 baseband\nProcessing bandwidth per input\n2 GHz\nNumber of bits per sample\n3 bits\nMaximum delay compensation\n> 18.5 km\nMaximum number of processed\n120 cross-correlations + 16 auto-correlations\ncorrelations per input\nHighest frequency resolution\n3.8 kHz\nIntegration in the time domain\n1 or 16 msec (for auto-correlations), 16 msec (for\ncross-correlations)\nMaximum correlator output rate\n8192 frequency channels per baseband\n\nFig. 1.- Upper-Left: A photo of Array Operations Site (AOS) (September 2009).
