Recent self-consistent hybrid and full particle simulations have demonstrated ion kinetics are\nessential for the non-stationarity of perpendicular collisionless shocks, which means that physical processes due to ion\nkinetics modify the shock jump condition for fluid plasmas. This is a cross-scale coupling between fluid dynamics and\nion kinetics. On the other hand, it is not easy to study cross-scale coupling of electron kinetics with ion kinetics or\nfluid dynamics, because it is a heavy task to conduct large-scale full particle simulations of collisionless shocks. In the\npresent study, we have performed a two-dimensional (2D) electromagnetic full particle simulation with a \"shock-restframe model\". The simulation domain is taken to be larger than the ion inertial length in order to include full kinetics\nof both electrons and ions. The present simulation result has confirmed the transition of shock structures from the\ncyclic self-reformation to the quasi-stationary shock front. During the transition, electrons and ions are thermalized\nin the direction parallel to the shock magnetic field. Ions are thermalized by low-frequency electromagnetic waves (or\nrippled structures) excited by strong ion temperature anisotropy at the shock foot, while electrons are thermalized\nby high-frequency electromagnetic waves (or whistler mode waves) excited by electron temperature anisotropy at the\nshock overshoot. Ion acoustic waves are also excited at the shock overshoot where the electron parallel temperature\nbecomes higher than the ion parallel temperature. We expect that ion acoustic waves are responsible for parallel\ndiffusion of both electrons and ions, and that a cross-scale coupling between an ion-scale mesoscopic instability and an\nelectron-scale microscopic instability is important for structures and dynamics of a collisionless perpendicular shock.\nKey words: collisionless shock; particle-in-cell simulation; cross-scale coupling\n\n1. Introduction\nDynamics of shock waves in plasmas are often\ndiscussed by the shock jump conditions (RankineHugoniot conditions), which describe conservation\nlaws of mass, momentum, energy, normal magnetic\nfield and motional electric field for fluid plasmas.\nEmail address: umeda@stelab.nagoya-u.ac.jp (Takayuki\nUmeda).\nArticle to be published in Planetary and Space Science\n\nOn the other hand, previous kinetic simulations\nrevealed that collisionless shocks in plasmas can be\nstrongly non-stationary in both spatial and temporal scales of ions. In the direction normal to the\nshock surface of a quasi-perpendicular collisionless shock, a new shock front periodically appears\n(e.g., Biskamp and Welter, 1972; Quest, 1985; Lembege and Dawson, 1987; Lembege and Savoini,\n1992; Hellinger et al., 2002), which is called the\nself-reformation. Incoming ions are reflected up2 November 2018\n\n\fstream at the shock ramp of a supercritical quasiperpendicular collisionless shock, and they form a\nfoot in front of the ramp during their gyration. At\nthe upstream edge of the foot, ions are accumulated in time and are reflected upstream, which are\nresponsible for the self-reformation. The cyclic selfreformation is due to ion dynamics, although this\nprocess has been confirmed in both electromagnetic\nhybrid and full particle simulations. In addition,\nrecent full particle simulations have shown that\nelectron-scale micro instabilities, such as Buneman\ninstability (e.g., Shimada and Hoshino, 2000) and\nmodified two-stream instability (e.g., Scholer et\nal., 2003) are excited at the foot during the cyclic\nself-reformation. Scholer and Matsukiyo (2004) has\nalso demonstrated that the modified two-stream instability is also responsible for the self-reformation.\nAnother mechanism of the self-reformation is steepening of whistler mode waves in upstream regions\nof oblique shocks (Krasnoselskikh et al., 2002).\nIn the shock-tangential direction, on the other\nhand, there appear fluctuations in the spatial scale\nof ion inertial length in the direction parallel to\nthe shock magnetic field (Winske and Quest, 1988;\nLowe and Burgess, 2003) or ion gyro radius of reflected ions in the direction perpendicular to the\nshock magnetic field (Burgess and Scholer, 2007),\nwhich are called the \"ripples\". The compression of\nincoming ions at collisionless shocks results in their\nadiabatic heating in the shock-normal direction. In\nquasi-perpendicular shocks, however, the ion heating in the shock-normal direction is more dominated\nby the gyration of reflected ions. Thus an ion temperature anisotropy between shock-normal and shocktangential directions becomes a common feature in\nthe transition region of quasi-perpendicular shocks.\nThe dynamic rippled character of the shock surface is thought to be related to the ion temperature anisotropy. Although this process has been confirmed in two-dimensional (2D) electromagnetic hybrid particle simulations, it is difficult to take into\naccount the dynamic rippled character of the shock\nsurface in 2D electromagnetic full particle simulations. This is because current computer resources\nare not necessarily enough to take such a large simulation domain of several ion inertial length.\nVery recently, however, there are several attempts\nof 2D electromagnetic full particle simulations that\ntake into account ion dynamics in both shocknormal and shock-surface directions (Hellinger et\nal. 2007; Amano and Hoshino, 2009; Lembege et\nal., 2009). These results indicate that ion-scale fluc-\n\ntuations at perpendicular collisionless shocks can\ndynamically change electron-scale processes such as\nwave excitation and electron acceleration. The purpose of this paper is to examine a cross-scale coupling between the dynamic rippled character of the\nshock surface and electron-scale micro instabilities.\nIn order to take into account ion dynamics in both\nshock-normal and shock-surface directions, a largescale 2D electromagnetic full particle simulation is\ncarried out by using the \"shock-rest-frame model\".\n2. Full Particle Simulations\n2.1. Shock-Rest-Frame Model\nThere are several different methods for exciting\ncollisionless shocks in kinetic simulations of plasmas. These include the injection method (or the\nreflection/wall method) (e.g., Quest, 1985; Winske\nand Quest, 1988; Shimada and Hoshino, 2000;\nHellinger et al. 2002; Lowe and Burgess, 2003;\nScholer et al., 2003; Burgess and Scholer, 2007;\nAmano and Hoshino, 2009). the plasma release\nmethod (Ohsawa, 1985), and the magnetic piston\nmethod (e.g., Biskamp and Welter, 1972; Lembege\nand Dawson, 1987; Lembege and Savoini, 1992). In\nthese methods, collisionless shocks are excited by an\ninteraction between a supersonic plasma flow and\na resting plasma. The simulation domain is taken\nin the downstream rest frame with the injection\nmethod, while the simulation domain is taken in\nthe upstream rest frame withe the plasma release\nand magnetic piston methods. Thus an excited\nshock wave propagates upstream in these methods.\nThere is also another method called the flow-flow\nmethod for exciting collisionless shocks (e.g., Omidi\nand Winske, 1992). Since collisionless shocks are\nexcited by an interaction between two supersonic\nplasma flows in this method, there exist forward\nand reverse shock waves. A big problem in these\nmethods is that excited collisionless shock waves\npropagate at a fast velocity, and it is necessary to\ntake a very long simulation domain in the propagation direction of the shock waves in order to follow a\nlong-time evolution of the shock waves. This makes\nit difficult to perform multidimensional simulations\neven with current supercomputer systems.\nAn alternative is to excite collisionless shocks in\nthe shock rest frame with the \"relaxation method\",\nwhereby collisionless shocks are excited by an interaction between a supersonic plasma flow and a sub2\n\n\fsonic plasma flow moving in the same direction. This\nmethod was first used in hybrid particle simulations\nin 1980's (e.g., Leroy et al., 1981, 1982), and then\nin full particle simulations in 1990's (Pantellini et\nal., 1992; Krauss-Varban et al., 1995). This method\nwas not so popular because of several difficulties in\nnumerical techniques, and its application to longterm evolution of shock waves was not considered.\nIn 2000's, however, long-term 1D simulations with\nthe relaxation method have been performed by using Darwin particle code (Muschietti and Lembege,\n2006) and full electromagnetic particle code (Umeda\nand Yamazaki, 2006). Very recently, the relaxation\nmethod has also been applied to long-term 2D full\nelectromagnetic particle simulations (Umeda et al.,\n2008, 2009). In general, it is not easy to perform a\nlarge-scale (ion-scale) multidimensional full electromagnetic particle simulations of collisionless shocks\neven with present-day supercomputers. Hence the\nshock-rest-frame model is important to be able to\nfollow the evolution of shock waves for a long term\nwith a limited computer resource.\n\ntemperatures Te2 and Ti2 , and magnetic field By02 .\nWe take the simulation domain in the x-y plane\nand assume a perpendicular shock (i.e., Bx0 = 0).\nSince the ambient magnetic field is taken in the y\ndirection, free motion of particles along the ambient\nmagnetic field is taken into account. As a motional\nelectric field, a uniform external electric field Ez0 =\n\u2212ux1 By01 = \u2212ux2 By02 is applied in both upstream\nand downstream regions, so that both electrons and\nions drift in the x direction. At the left boundary\nof the simulation domain in the x direction, we inject plasmas with the same quantities as those in\nthe upstream region, while plasmas with the same\nquantities as those in the downstream region are\nalso injected from the right boundary in the x direction. We adopted absorbing boundaries to suppress\nnon-physical reflection of electromagnetic waves at\nboth ends of simulation domain in the x direction\n(Umeda et al., 2001), while the periodic boundaries\nare imposed in the y direction.\nIn the relaxation method, the initial condition\nis given by solving the shock jump conditions\n(Rankine-Hugoniot conditions) for a magnetized\ntwo-fluid isotropic plasma consisting of electrons\nand ions (Hudson, 1970). In order to determine a\nunique initial downstream state, we need given upstream quantities ux1 , \u03c9pe1 , \u03c9ce1 , vte1 , and vti1 and\nan additional parameter. We assume a low-beta\nand weakly-magnetized plasma such that \u03b2e1 =\n\u03b2i1 = 0.125 and \u03c9ce1 /\u03c9pe1 = \u22120.1 in the upstream\nregion. We also use a reduced ion-to-electron mass\nratio mi /me = 25 for computational efficiency. The\nlight speed c/vte1 = 40.0 and the bulk flow velocity\nof the upstream plasma ux1 /vte1 = 4.0 are also assumed. Then, the Alfv\u00e9n Machpnumber is calculated\nas MA = (ux1 /c)|\u03c9pe1 /\u03c9ce1 | mi /me = 5.0. The\nion-to-electron temperature ratio in the upstream\nregion is given as Ti1 /Te1 = 1.0. In this study, downstream ion-to-electron temperature ratio Ti2 /Te2 =\n8.0 is also assumed as another initial parameter\nto obtain the unique downstream quantities by\nsolving the shock jump conditions, \u03c9pe2 /\u03c9pe1 =\n1.8372, \u03c9ce2 /\u03c9pe1 = 0.3375, ux2 /vte1 = 1.1851, and\nvte2 /vte1 = 2.6393.\nIn this study, we perform two runs with different\nsizes of the simulation domain. We use Nx \u00d7 Ny =\n2048 \u00d7 1024 cells for the upstream region and Nx \u00d7\nNy = 2048 \u00d7 1024 cells for the downstream region,\nrespectively, in Run A. The grid spacing and time\nstep of the present simulation are \u2206x/\u03bbDe1 = 1.0\nand \u03c9pe1 \u2206t = 0.0125, respectively. Here \u03bbDe1 is the\nelectron Debye length upstream. Thus the total size\n\n2.2. Simulation Setup\nWe use a 2D full electromagnetic particle code\n(Umeda, 2004), in which the full set of Maxwell's\nequations and the relativistic equation of motion\nfor individual electrons and ions are solved in a\nself-consistent mannar. The continuity equation for\ncharge is also solved to compute the exact current\ndensity given by the motion of charged particles\n(Umeda et al., 2003).\nThe initial state consists of two uniform regions\nseparated by a discontinuity. In the upstream region that is taken in the left hand side of the simulation domain, electrons and ions are distributed\nuniformly in space and are given random velocities\n(vx , vy , vz ) to approximate shifted Maxwellian momentum distributions with the drift velocity ux1 ,\n2\nnumber density n1 \u2261 \u01eb0 me \u03c9pe1\n/e2 , isotropic tem2\n2\nperatures Te1 \u2261 me vte1 and Ti1 \u2261 mi vti1\n, where m,\ne, \u03c9p and vt are the mass, charge, plasma frequency\nand thermal velocity, respectively. Subscripts \"1\"\nand \"2\" denote \"upstream\" and \"downstream\",\nrespectively. The upstream magnetic field By01 \u2261\n\u2212me \u03c9ce1 /e is also assumed to be uniform, where\n\u03c9c is the cyclotron frequency (with sign included).\nThe downstream region taken in the right-hand\nside of the simulation domain is prepared similarly\nwith the drift velocity ux2 , density n2 , isotropic\n3\n\n\fof the simulation domain is 10.24li \u00d7 5.12li which is\nlong enough to include the ion-scale rippled structure, where li = c/\u03c9pi1 (= 200\u03bbDe1 ) is the ion inertial length. In Run B, we use Nx \u00d7 Ny = 2048 \u00d7 128\ncells for the upstream region and Nx \u00d7 Ny = 2048 \u00d7\n128 cells for the downstream region, respectively.\nThus the the total size of the simulation domain is\n10.24li \u00d7 0.64li , in which ion-scale processes along\nthe ambient magnetic field is neglected. We used 16\npairs of electrons and ions per cell in the upstream\nregion and 64 pairs of electrons and ions per cell in\nthe downstream region, respectively, at the initial\nstate.\n3. Results\nFigure 1 shows the tangential component of\nmagnetic field By as a function of position x and\ntime t for Runs A and B. The position and time\nare renormalized by the ion inertial length li and\nthe ion cyclotron angular period 1/\u03c9ci1 , respectively. The magnitude is normalized by the initial\nupstream magnetic field By01 . In Fig.1, the tangential magnetic fields By are averaged over the\ny direction, which means that fluctuations in the\nshock-tangential direction are neglected.\nIn the present shock-rest-frame model, a shock\nwave is excited by the relaxation of the two plasmas with different quantities. Since the initial state\nis given by the shock jump conditions for a \"twofluid\" plasma consisting of electrons and ions, the\nkinetic effect is excluded in the initial state and the\nexcited shock becomes \"almost\" at rest in the simulation domain. In both runs, the shock front appears\nand disappears on a timescale of the downstream\nion gyro period, which corresponds to the cyclic selfreformation of a perpendicular shock. The reformation takes place for more than \u03c9ci1 t = 12 in Run B,\nwhile the reformation seems to be less significant after \u03c9ci1 t \u223c 8 in Run A. The previous 2D full particle\nsimulations have demonstrated the transition from\nthe cyclic self-reformation to a \"quasi-stationary\"\nshock front (Hellinger et al., 2007; Lembege et al.,\n2009), which is in agreement with Run A. However,\nit should be noted that the self-reformation does\ntake place even after \u03c9ci1 t \u223c 8 in Run A, but on\na different timescale, when we focus on a local tangential magnetic field.\nWhen the length of the simulation domain in\nthe shock-tangential direction is shorter than the\nion inertial length, ion-scale fluctuations along\n\nFig. 1.

The present\nresult suggests that the ion-scale fluctuations in the\nshock-tangential direction play an important role\nin the sequential appearance of non-stationary and\nquasi-stationary shock fronts.\nFigure 2 shows the electron and ion temperatures\nas a function of position x and time t for Run A.\nThe panels (a), (b) and (c) corresponds to the temperature ratios Te|| /Ti|| , Ti|| /Ti\u22a5 and Te|| /Te\u22a5 , respectively. The panels (d) and (e) corresponds to the\nparallel temperatures of electrons and ions, Te|| and\nTi|| , respectively. Note that these temperatures are\naveraged over the y direction, and that the parallel temperatures are approximated by the temperatures in the y direction while the perpendicular temperatures are approximated by the average of temperatures in the x and z directions.\nFrom \u03c9ci1 t \u223c 7, the electron temperature in the\n4\n\n\fFig. 2.

The position and time are normalized by \u03bbi and 1/\u03c9ci1 , respectively. The temperatures are normalized\nby the initial upstream temperature (Te01 = Ti01 ). These temperatures are averaged over the y direction. Here, the parallel\ntemperatures are approximated by the temperatures in the y direction while the perpendicular temperatures are approximated\nby the average of temperatures in the x and z directions.\n\ndirection parallel to the ambient magnetic field, Te|| ,\nat the shock overshoot becomes twice as large as the\nion parallel temperature, Ti|| . At the shock foot, the\nelectron perpendicular temperature, Te\u22a5 , is higher\nthan the electron parallel temperature, Te|| . On the\nother hand, Te|| becomes higher than Te\u22a5 at the\nshock overshoot. In the downstream region, Te|| is\nslightly higher than Te\u22a5 . As seen in Fig.2d, electrons\nare strongly thermalized in the direction parallel to\nthe shock magnetic field at the overshoot, suggesting\nthat there exists a strong parallel diffusion process at\nthe overshoot from \u03c9ci1 t \u223c 7. On the other hand, ion\nparallel temperature becomes higher at the shock\nfoot and in the downstream region as seen in Fig.2e.\nFig.2 shows that electrons and ions are thermalized\nin different regions, suggesting that electrons and\nions heating takes place on different scales.\nFigure 3 shows snapshots of shock magnetic field\nBy , ion density ni , ion parallel temperature Ti|| , ion\nparallel temperature Ti\u22a5 , and ion temperature ratio Ti|| /Ti\u22a5 . at \u03c9ci t = 12 for Runs A and B. Although the Mach number of the present simulation\nrun is relatively low (MA = 5), the present perpendicular shock is supercritical, and therefore the cyclotron motion of reflected ions is dominant for ion\nheating in the shock-normal direction. At the shock\novershoot, the ion parallel and perpendicular temperatures are low because of the accumulation of\nupstream cold ions. The ion perpendicular temperature becomes higher at the shock foot because of\nthe non-gyrotropic velocity distribution of reflected\nions. At the shock foot, ions are also thermalized\n\nin the parallel direction because of an anisotropydriven ion cyclotron wave in Run A. However, the\nion parallel heating is not responsible for the electron parallel heating (see Fig.2). As seen in Fig.3,\nthe ion temperature anisotropy (Ti\u22a5 /Ti|| > 1) would\nbe a common feature at perpendicular collisionless\nshocks. In Run B, there is no ion parallel heating\nbecause the system length does not allow the existence of an ion cyclotron wave in the parallel direction. Thus the temperature anisotropy becomes\nmuch higher than in Run A.\nIn order to study mechanisms for parallel heating of electrons and ions, we take Fourier transformation of the shock-normal magnetic field component Bx and the shock-tangential electric field component Ey in the transition region. Figure 4 shows\nfrequency-wavenumber spectra of the shock-normal\nmagnetic field component Bx for different time intervals: (a)\u03c9ci1 t = 4 \u223c 6, (b)\u03c9ci1 t = 6 \u223c 8, (c)\u03c9ci1 t =\n8 \u223c 10, and (d)\u03c9ci1 t = 10 \u223c 12. The frequency and\nwavenumber are normalized by \u03c9pe1 and \u03c9pe1 /vte1 ,\nrespectively. These frequency-wavenumber spectra\nare obtained by projection of \u03c9 \u2212 kx \u2212 ky spectra\nonto the \u03c9 \u2212 ky plane. Note that the typical electron\nand ion cyclotron frequencies in the transition region are \u03c9ce \u223c 0.4\u03c9pe1 and \u03c9ci \u223c 0.016\u03c9pe1, respectively, and their maximum values are \u03c9ce \u223c 0.7\u03c9pe1\nand \u03c9ci \u223c 0.028\u03c9pe1 , respectively, at the overshoot.\nIn Fig.4, we found a strong enhancement of Bx\ncomponent below \u03c9ci , which might correspond to\nthe rippled structures due to the ion temperature\nanisotropy. We also found an enhancement of Bx\n5\n\n\fcomponent over \u03c9ci , suggesting that electromagnetic electron cyclotron waves are excited in the\ntransition region, which might correspond to the\n\"nonlinear whistler waves\" reported by Hellinger et\nal. (2007) and Lembege et al. (2009).\nFor \u03c9ci1 t = 6 \u223c 8 the high-frequency electromagnetic electron cyclotron waves are enhanced over\n\u03c9/\u03c9pe1 = 0.4, while other time intervals the Bx component is enhanced up to \u03c9/\u03c9pe1 = 0.4, implying\nthat the high-frequency waves are responsible for the\nparallel heating of electrons at \u03c9ci t \u223c 7 (Fig.2a and\n2d). Note that excitation of electromagnetic whistler\nmode waves due to electron temperature anisotropy\nare observed in the previous 2D simulations of perpendicular shocks (Umeda et al., 2008). Since the\nelectron parallel temperature becomes higher than\nthe electron perpendicular temperature for \u03c9ci t >\n7, whistler mode waves due to electron temperature\nanisotropy.\nIons are thermalized in the direction parallel to\nthe shock magnetic field by the low-frequency electromagnetic waves below \u03c9ci . However, these waves\nare not so much responsible for the parallel heating\nof electrons, because there is not significant parallel heating of electrons at the shock foot as seen in\nFig.2d.\nFigure 5 shows frequency-wavenumber spectra\nof the shock-normal magnetic field component Ey\nin the transition region for different time intervals:\n(a)\u03c9ci1 t = 4 \u223c 6, (b)\u03c9ci1 t = 6 \u223c 8, (c)\u03c9ci1 t =\n8 \u223c 10, and (d)\u03c9ci1 t = 10 \u223c 12. with the same\nformat as Fig.4. The typical ion plasma frequency\nin the transition region is \u03c9pi \u223c 0.35\u03c9pe1 , and its\nmaximum value is \u03c9ce \u223c 0.6\u03c9pe1 at the overshoot.\nFor \u03c9ci1 t = 6 \u223c 12, we found a strong enhancement of the Ey component up to \u03c9/\u03c9pe1 \u223c 0.7, while\nthere is not any enhancement in a high-frequency\nrange for \u03c9ci1 t = 4 \u223c 6. The phase velocity of these\nwave are estimated as vp /vte1 = 1.0 \u223c 1.5. From\nFig.2, the typical parallel temperatures of electrons\nand ions are estimated as Te|| \u223c 18Te01 and Te|| \u223c\n9Ti01 . Thus the ion acoustic velocity is obtained as\ns\nTe|| + \u03b3Ti||\n\u223c 1.3vte1\n(1)\nvs =\nmi\nwith \u03b3 = 3, suggesting that the ion acoustic waves\nare excited in the transition region. As shown in\nFig.2a, the electron parallel temperature becomes\nhigher than the ion parallel temperature due to electron cyclotron waves at the shock overshoot, which\nis a suitable condition for excitation of ion acoustic\n\nFig. 3.

The shock front becomes turbulent instead of quasi-stationary. We expect that the ion\nacoustic waves would play a role in the transition\nprocess from the self-reformation phase to the turbulent phase, because ion acoustic waves are responsible for diffusion of both electrons and ions along a\nmagnetic field.\n\n(v) Strong parallel heating of electrons at the\nshock overshoot results in the suitable condition for excitation of ion acoustic waves. The\nrippled structure might be an energy source\nof the ion acoustic waves. However, their detailed excitation mechanism is not yet clear.\nThe ion acoustic waves are responsible for\nparallel diffusion of both electrons and ions.\nWe expect that the ion acoustic waves have a\ndirect implication with the transition from the\nself-reformation phase to the turbulent phase.\n(vi) A cross-scale coupling between an ion-scale\nmesoscopic instability and an electron-scale\nmicroscopic instability is important for structures and dynamics of collisionless perpendicular shocks. Hence large-scale full kinetic simulations are quite important.\nIt is noted that Yuan et al. (2009) have demonstrated the cyclic self-reformation in their 2D hybrid simulation of a quasi-perpendicular shock with\n\u03b8 = 85\u25e6 , which is different from the results in purely\nperpendicular shocks. We are now trying to check\nwhether the reformation is suppressed or not at a\noblique shock by a large-scale 2D PIC simulation.\nHowever, this is beyond the scope of the present paper.\nFinally, the effect of mass ratio is discussed.\nIn the present simulation parameter (MA =\n5, \u03c9pe1 /\u03c9ce1 = 10, \u03b2 = 0.125), electron cyclotron\n(Bernstein) modes is weakly unstable due to current driven instability with a reduced mass ratio\n(e.g., Muschietti and Lembege, 2006). When we use\nthe real mass ratio of mi /me = 1836, the thermal\nvelocity of upstream electrons becomes about 8.6\ntimes as large as the case of mi /me = 25, and the\nelectron cyclotron modes are stabilized. In contrast\nwith current driven instability, obliquely propagating whistler mode waves becomes unstable due to\nmodified two-stream instability (Matsukiyo and Scholer, 2003, 2006). However, the evolution of modified two-stream instability at perpendicular shocks\nhas been studied only in a localized uniform model\n(Matsukiyo and Scholer, 2006). The influences of\nmodified two-stream instability on the reformation\nprocess of perpendicular shocks is an outstanding\nissue to be addressed by future 2D PIC simulations\nof perpendicular collisionless shocks.\n\n4. Summary\nWe performed a 2D electromagnetic full particle\nsimulation of a low-Mach-number perpendicular collisionless shock. The results are itemized below.\n(i) It has been confirmed that the cyclic selfreformation of the shock front becomes less\nsignificant as time elapses, which is consistent\nwith the previous 2D simulations (Hellinger\net al., 2007; Lembege et al., 2009). The shock\nfront appears to be \"quasi-stationary\" by\naveraging the spatial profiles of electromagnetic fields over the shock-tangential direction, although electron-scale microscopic and\nion-scale mesoscopic instabilities are quite dynamic and the shock front becomes turbulent.\n(ii) During the transition from the cyclic selfreformation to the turbulent shock front,\nelectrons and ions are thermalized in the direction parallel to the shock magnetic field in\ndifferent regions and by different mechanisms.\nThe electron parallel temperature is more enhanced than the parallel ion temperature at\nthe shock overshoot.\n(iii) Low-frequency electromagnetic (ion cyclotron\nor mirror mode) waves are excited at the shock\nfoot, which corresponds to the rippled structure in the shock-tangential direction. These\nwaves are excited by the strong temperature\nanisotropy of ions. Ions are thermalized in the\ndirection parallel to the shock magnetic field\nby these waves, but electrons are not.\n(iv) Electromagnetic electron cyclotron (whistler\nmode) waves are excited at the shock overshoot. These waves are excited by the temperature anisotropy of electrons. Electrons are\nthermalized in the direction parallel to the\nshock magnetic field by these waves, but ions\nare not.\n8\n\n\fAcknowledgements\n[12]\n\nThe authors are grateful to S.
