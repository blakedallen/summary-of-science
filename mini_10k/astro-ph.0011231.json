The current status of the UltraHigh Energy Cosmic Ray (UHE CR) enigma\nand several proposed solutions involving particle physics beyond the standard model\nare discussed. Emphasis is given to top\u2013down models, and as a main example, supermassive dark matter as galactic source for UHE CR and the status of its experimental\nsignatures (galactic anisotropy, chemical composition and clustering) is reviewed. Then\ndifferent approaches to calculate fragmentation spectra of supermassive particles are\ndiscussed. Finally, it is argued that UHE neutrinos cannot be \u2013 neither directly or\nindirectly \u2013 responsible for the observed vertical air showers.\n\nI\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nCosmic Rays [1] (CR) are observed in a wide energy range, starting from subGeV\nenergies up to 3 \u00d7 1020 eV. Apart from the highest energies, these particles are\naccelerated in our Galaxy, most probably by shocks produced by SNII explosions.\nSince the galactic magnetic field cannot confine and isotropize particles with energy\nhigher than \u223c Z \u00d7 1019 eV, it is natural to think that the UltraHigh Energy (UHE)\ncomponent has an extragalactic origin. Moreover, the acceleration of protons or\nnuclei up to 2\u20133\u00d71020 eV is difficult to explain within the known astrophysical\ngalactic sources.\nThe most prominent signature of extragalactic UHECR is the so called Greisen\u2013\nZatsepin\u2013Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff [2]: the energy losses of protons sharply increase\nat EGZK \u2248 6 \u00d7 1019 eV, owing to scattering on photons from the microwave background, p + \u03b33K \u2192 \u2206+ \u2192 N + \u03c0, reducing their mean free path length to less than\n50 Mpc or so. Nuclei exhibit a similar cutoff at the same energy, while photons have\nno sharp cutoff but an even shorter free mean path, because of pair-production on\nthe radio background. Thus, the UHECR spectrum should dramatically steepen\nabove EGZK for any homogeneous distribution of proton or nuclei sources. However, the observed spectrum extends up to 3 \u00d7 1020 eV and this maximum seems to\nbe caused by the limited exposure. Both spectra, the expected and the observed\none, are shown in Fig. 1, taken from Ref. [3].\n1)\n\nInvited talk at \"CAPP 2000\", Verbier, July 2000\n\nCERN-TH 2000-324\n\n\f26\n\n10\n\nJ(E) E 3 [m -2 sec-1 sr -1 eV 2 ]\n\nAGASA\n\n25\n\n10\n\n1\n3\n\n6\n\n4\n2\n\n24\n\n10\n\nUniform sources\n\n23\n\n10\n\n19\n\n20\n\n10\n\n10\n\nEnergy [eV]\n\nFIGURE 1. Energy spectrum as observed by AGASA. Error bars are 68% C.L., numbers are\nthe number of events per energy bin. The dashed line is the spectrum expected from uniformly\ndistributed astrophysical sources (from Ref. [3]).\n\nThere is another argument that disfavours the standard astrophysical sources: At\nenergies E \u223c 1020 eV, the arrival direction of the primaries which is known within\nseveral degrees should point towards their site of origin. But no source of UHECR\nsuch us active galactic nuclei (AGN) has been found within 50 Mpc in the direction\nof these events. In Fig. 2, the arrival directions of 92 events above 4 \u00d7 1019 eV are\nshown in galactic coordinates [4]. The events are scattered isotropically on larger\nscales, and no significant enhancement towards the galactic or supergalactic plane\nis found. Intriguingly, about 20% of the events are clustered in angular doublets or\neven triplets; both triplets are found near the supergalactic plane.\nAn elegant solution to some of the problems described above are top\u2013down models: in contrast to the standard sources, the primaries are not accelerated but\nare the fragmentation products of some decaying superheavy particle X. For X> 1012 GeV, the acceleration problem is solved trivially.\nparticles with mass mX \u223c\nMoreover, these sources also evade detection by normal astronomical methods.\nThis review is organised as follows: In Sec. II top-down models and in Sec. III\ntheir signatures are presented. We then discuss how the spectrum of hadrons\nproduced in the decay of supermassive particles can be calculated. Finally, we\nargue in Sec. 5 that UHE neutrinos cannot be \u2013 neither directly or indirectly via\nresonant annihilations on relic neutrinos \u2013 responsible for the observed UHECR\nevents.\nFor a review of astrophysical sources, we refer the interested reader to Ref. [5].\nThe suggestion that the violation of Lorentz invariance induced by quantum gravity\neffects avoids the GZK cutoff is covered in the recent review [6].\n\n\f60\n\nGal. Lati.\n30\n\nGal.

The\nsupergalactic plane is shown by the dotted line, the hatched region is unobservable.\n\nII\n\nTOP\u2013DOWN MODELS\n\nTop\u2013down model is a generic name for all proposals in which the observed\nUHECR primaries are produced as decay products of some superheavy particles X.\nThese X particles can be either metastable or be emitted by topological defects at\nthe present epoch.\n1. Topological defects (TD) [7] such as (superconducting) cosmic strings,\nmonopoles, and hybrid defects can be effectively produced in non-thermal phase\ntransitions during the preheating stage [8]. Therefore the presence of TDs is not\nin conflict with an inflationary period of the early Universe. They can naturally\nproduce particles with large enough energies but fail generally to produce the observed flux of UHE primaries: The observation of the low energy diffuse gamma\nradiation by EGRET limits the energy dumped by high-energy particles into electromagnetic cascades and thereby also severely the possible UHECR flux. Another\ngeneral reason for the low fluxes is the large distance between TDs, which is often comparable to the Hubble radius. Then the flux of UHE particles is either\nexponentially suppressed or strongly anisotropic if a TD is by chance nearby.\nOrdinary strings can produce UHE particles e.g. when string loops self-intersect\nor when two cusp segments overlap and annihilate. In the latter case, the maximal\nenergy of the produced fragmentation products is not mX /2 but can be much larger\ndue to the high Lorentz factors of the ejected X particles.\nSuperconducting strings: Cosmic strings can be superconducting in a broad class\nof particle models. Electric currents can be induced in the string either by a\nprimordial magnetic field that decreases during the expansion of the Universe or\nwhen the string moves through galactic fields at present. If the Fermi momentum\n\n\fof the the trapped particles exceeds their mass outside the string, they can leave\nthe string and decay.\nMonopolium M \u2013 boundstates of monopole\u2013antimonopole pairs \u2013 was the first\nTD proposed as UHECR source [9]. It clusters like Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and is\ntherefore an example of a SuperHeavy Dark Matter (SHDM) particle. The galactic\ndensity of monopoles is constrained by the Parker limit: the galactic magnetic\nfield should not be eliminated by the acceleration of monopoles. Reference [10]\nconcluded that the resulting limit on the UHECR flux produced by Monopolium\nannihilation is 10 orders of magitude too low.\nCosmic necklaces are hybrid defects consisting of monopoles connected by a\nstring. These defects are produced by the symmetry breaking G \u2192 H \u00d7 U(1) \u2192\nH \u00d7Z2 , where G is semi-simple. In the first phase transition at scale \u03b7m , monopoles\nare produced. At the second phase transition, at scale \u03b7s < \u03b7m , each monopole\ngets attached to two strings. Strings lose their energy and can contract through\ngravitational radiation. As a result, all monopoles annihilate in the end producing\nX-particles. Reference [11] argued that for a reasonable range of parameters the\nmodel predicts a UHECR flux close to the observed one. Recently, a numerical\nstudy [12] of the evolution of necklaces found that the lifetime of necklaces is\ngenerally much shorter than the age of the Universe t0 . A possible exception is\nthe case \u03b7m \u226b \u03b7s \u223c 100 GeV [10], not a very attractive possibility in view of the\n> 600 GeV.\nlimits on the Z \u2032 boson mass, mZ \u2032 \u223c\n2. Superheavy metastable relic particles (SHDM) were proposed in Refs. [13,14]\nas UHECR source. They constitute (part of) the CDM and, consequently, their\nabundance in the galactic halo is enhanced by a factor \u223c 5 \u00d7 104 above their\nextragalactic abundance. Therefore, the proton and photon flux is dominated by\nthe halo component and the GZK\u2013cutoff is avoided, as was pointed out in Ref. [13].\nThe quotient rX = \u03a9X (t0 /\u03c4X ) of relic abundance \u03a9X and lifetime \u03c4X of the Xparticle is fixed by the UHECR flux, rX \u223c O(10\u221211 ).\nThe relative abundance of particles that were in thermal equilibrium and then\n<\nfreeze-out is \u03a9h2 \u221d 1/(\u03c3ann v). Assuming for the annihilation cross-section \u03c3ann \u223c\n2\n<\n1/mX one obtains the bound mX \u223c 1 TeV. Therefore SHDM particles should never\nhave been in thermal equilibrium and the challenge is to create create only few of\nthem in a natural way.\nThere exist several plausible non-equilibrium production mechanisms. The most\npromising one is the gravitational production of the X particles by the nonadiabatic change of the scale factor at the end of inflation [15]. In this scenario, the\ngravitational coupling of the X-field to the background metric yields the present\nabundance \u03a90 \u223c 1 for MX \u223c 1013 GeV, independent of any specific particle physics\nmodel. Other mechanisms proposed are thermal production during reheating, production through inflaton decay at the preheating phase, or through the decay of\nhybrid defects.\n< \u03c4X \u223c\n< 1028 s,\nThe lifetime of the superheavy particle has to be in the range 1017 s \u223c\ni.e. longer or much longer than the age of the Universe. Therefore it is an obvious\n\n\fquestion to ask if such an extremely small decay rate can be obtained without\nfine-tuning. A well-known example of how metastability can be achieved is the\nproton: in the standard model B\u2013L is a conserved global symmetry, and the proton\ncan decay only via non-renormalizable operators. Similarly, the X-particle could\nbe protected by a new global symmetry which is only broken by higher-dimension\noperators suppressed by M d , where for instance M \u223c MPl and d \u2265 7 is possible.\nThe case of discrete gauged symmetries has been studied in detail in Refs. [16].\nAnother possibility is that the global symmetry is broken only non-perturbatively,\neither by wormhole [13] or instanton [14] effects. Then an exponential suppression\nof the decay process is expected and lifetimes \u03c4X \u226b t0 can be naturally achieved.\nAn example of a SHDM particle in a realistic particle physics model is the crypton [17]. Cryptons are boundstates from a strongly interacting hidden sector of\nstring/M theory. Their mass is determined by the non-perturbative dynamics of\nthis sector. For example, flipped SU(5) motivated by string theory contains boundstates with mass \u223c 1012 GeV and \u03c4 \u223c 1015 yr [18].\n\nIII\n\nTHE SIGNATURES OF TOP-DOWN MODELS\n\nSuperheavy dark matter has three clear signatures: 1. No GZK-cutoff, instead a\nflat spectrum (compared to astrophysical sources) up to mX /2. 2. High neutrino\nand photon fluxes compared to the proton flux. 3. Galactic anisotropy. Possibly,\nthe observed small-scale clustering gives additional constraints.\nChemical composition: Since at the end of the QCD cascade quarks combine more\neasily to mesons than to baryons, the main component of the UHE flux are neutrinos\nand photons from pion decay with only a small admixture (\u223c 5%) of nucleons (cf.\nalso Fig. 3). The differentiation between photon\u2013 and proton\u2013induced air showers\nis however rather difficult at the highest energies: the muon content of photoninduced showers becomes at UHE similar to that of proton-induced showers [19].\nThe Landau\u2013Pomeranchuk\u2013Migdal effect reduces the electromagnetic interactions\nat these energies, while the geomagnetic field makes the processes \u03b3 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 and\n\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 possible. Reference [20] finds that above 4 \u00d7 1019 eV less than 55% of\nthe UHE primaries can be photons. Since the AGASA data suggest that \"normal\"\nsources dominate the flux up to 1020 eV and the flux is steeply falling with energy,\nthis results seems to be still not problematic for SHDM models. Recently, Ref. [21]\nclaimed that the Flye's Eye event at 3 \u00d7 1020 eV is inconsistent with a proton or\nphoton as primary. They compared the event with the average depths from simulations instead of either only comparing the shape of the showers or taking into\naccount the fluctuations of the first interaction point. Thus their conclusions, that\ndo not agree with those of Ref. [22], seem to be artificially strong. Future fluorescence light detectors like HiRes [23] which are able to measure the complete shower\ndevelopment will reliably distinguish between photon and proton as primaries.\nGalactic anisotropy: Dubovsky and Tinyakov noted that the UHECR flux from\nSHDM should show a galactic anisotropy, because the Sun is not in the centre of\n\n\fthe Galaxy [25]. The degree of this anisotropy depends on how strong the CDM is\nconcentrated near the galactic centre \u2013 a question currently under debate. Since the\ngalactic center cannot be observed by present detectors, the predicted anisotropy\nis rather small. Reference [26] performed a harmonic analysis of the UHECR flux\npredicted by the SHDM model and found reasonable agreement with the AGASA\ndata above 4\u00d71019 eV, although the statistical significance of these results is small.\nSimilar results were obtained in Ref. [27]. We thus have to wait for the AUGER\ndetector [24] which is currently built in Argentina and can see the galactic centre\nfor a definite answer.\nClustering: Although the distribution of UHECR arrival directions is consistent\nwith isotropy on larger scales, it shows an enhanced rate of clustering: The set\nof 92 UHECR with E \u2265 4 \u00d7 1019 eV contains 2 triplets and 7 doublets; above\nE \u2265 1020 eV, there are 2 doublets within 14 UHECR [4]. The chance probability\nto observe the clustered events in the case of an isotropic distribution of arrival\ndirections was estimated to be < 1%.\nWaxman, Fisher and Piran pointed out [28] that the number density n of uniformly distributed UHECR sources can be strongly constrained by the fraction of\nclustered events. As n decreases, the sources have to become brighter for a fixed\nUHECR flux and therefore the probability for clustering increases. The analysis of\nRef. [29] showed that \u223c 400 sources should be inside the GZK volume, compared\nto \u223c 10 GRB sources or \u223c 250 AGNs of which only a small fraction is thought to\nbe UHECR sources. However, the statistical uncertainties are still very large.\nThe clustering probability was discussed for SHDM in Ref. [30]. The authors\nassumed a smooth NFW profile (n(r) \u221d r \u22121 for r \u2192 0) for the SHDM plus a\nclumped component and obtained a rather good agreement with the observed clustering statistics. Table 1 shows the experimentally observed number of doublets N2\nwithin 3\u25e6 , 4\u25e6 and 5\u25e6 compared with the average numbers hN2 i obtained in the simulation. Also shown is the probability p to observe N2 or more doublets.

The high photon/proton ratio at\ngeneration can be masked by the strong absorption of UHE photons, but it is still\nhigher than expected from astrophysical sources. A crucial test can be the (non-)\nobservation of the large flux of UHE neutrinos predicted in all top\u2013down models.\nFinally, the GZK\u2013cutoff is less pronounced for TDs than for astrophysical sources,\nbecause of the flatter generation spectrum of the UHE particles.\n\n\fIV\n\nFRAGMENTATION SPECTRUM OF HADRONS\n\nTo make detailed predictions about the energy spectrum of UHECR in top-down\nmodels, the spectrum of hadrons produced in QCD cascades has to be known.\nSince mX is much above the supposed mass scale of supersymmetric particles,\nSUSY partons (gluinos and squarks) should be included in the cascade development.\nThere are different strategies to do this:\n\u2022 Analytical solutions of the DGLAP equations, in particular the limiting spectrum, are known to describe quite accurately the observed hadron spectra\nproduced in e+ e\u2212 annihilations. Therefore the limiting spectrum for SUSYQCD was derived and proposed as a useful description of hadron spectra at\nlarge mX in Ref. [31].\nHowever, two assumptions are used in the derivation of the limiting spectrum\nwhich prevent it from being useful in the case of SUSY-QCD: First, the number of active flavours nf has to be kept constant. Second, the cutoff Q0 for\nthe perturbative evolutions of the QCD cascade is identified with \u039b, which\nfixes the strength of the strong coupling via \u03b1s (Q2 ) = 4\u03c0/b ln(Q2 /\u039b2 ). This\nidentification makes sense for nf = 3, when both parameters are \u223c 250 MeV,\nbut not for nf = 6 or even above the SUSY threshold.\n\u2022 Another possibility is to evolve the fragmentation functions Dia measured at\nlow energies to the higher scale mX with the DGLAP equations [32],\nX Z 1 dz \u03b1s (Q2 )\n\u2202\na\n2\nD (x, Q ) =\nPji (z)Dja (x/z, Q2 ) .\n\u2202 ln Q2 i\nz\n2\u03c0\nx\nj\n\n(1)\n\nIn this approach, the region of accessible x values is restricted by the lowenergy data.\n\u2022 Available Monte Carlo simulations such as HERWIG or JETSET have precision, time and memory problems for large mX and can be used, if at all,\nonly after modifications. Furthermore, supersymmetric partons are only included as resonances at present, but not in the QCD cascade. In Ref. [33],\nHERWIG was used to calculate the spectra of stable particles produced in X\n> 0.2 can comdecay within QCD. It was found that the proton flux at x \u223c\npete with the photon and neutrino flux. However, it was realized later that\nthe overproduction of baryons at large x is an artifact of the hadronization\nprocedure used in HERWIG [32].\nIn Ref. [34], the results of a new Monte Carlo simulation, especially written for\nUHE, were presented. The simulation includes SUSY partons and a resulting\nspectrum for UHECR is shown in Fig. 3. An advantage of this approach is\nthat also the spectrum of the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP) can be\ncalculated, which is stable if R-parity is conserved. The energy fraction taken\naway by the LSP can be considerable [35] owing to its hard spectrum and was\nfound to be \u223c 10%.\n\n\f26\n\nE 3 j(E)/ m\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 eV2\n\n25.5\n\n\u03bd\n25\n\n\u03b3\n\n24.5\n24\n23.5\n\nN\n\n23\n22.5\n22\n19\n\n19.5\n\n20\n\n20.5\n\n21\n\n21.5\n\nlog(E/eV)\nFIGURE 3. Flux of UHE particles from X-particle decay with mX = 3 \u00d7 1012 GeV. The\nfragmentation spectra are from the Monte Carlo simulation [34]; only the halo component is\nshown.\n\nV\n\nUHE NEUTRINOS\n\nNeutrinos are the only known stable particles that can traverse extragalactic\n> EGZK , thus avoiding the GZK\nspace without attenuation even at energies E \u223c\ncutoff. Therefore, it has been speculated that the UHE primaries initiating the\nobserved air showers are not protons, nuclei or photons but neutrinos [36\u201338].\nHowever, neutrinos are in the Standard Model (SM) deeply penetrating particles\nproducing only horizontal not vertical Extensive Air Showers (EAS). Therefore,\neither one has to postulate new interaction that enhance the UHE neutrino-nucleon\ncross-section or the neutrino has to be converted locally into a strongly interacting\nhadron.\n\nA\n\nAnnihilations on relic neutrinos\n\nIn the later scheme [39], UHE neutrinos from distant sources annihilate with relic\nneutrinos on the Z resonance. The fragmentation products from nearby Z decays\nare supposed to be the primaries responsible for the EAS above the GZK-cutoff.\nFor energies of the primary neutrino of E\u03bd \u223c 1023 eV, the mass of the relic neutrino\nshould be m\u03bd = m2Z /(2E\u03bd ) \u223c 0.1 eV which is compatible with atmospheric neutrino\ndata. There are, however, severe observational constraints on this model:\n1. Since the Pauli principle does not allow arbitrary densely packed neutrinos, an\nupper limit for their number density n in the galactic halo is n \u2264 (4\u03c0/3)p3max, where\n\n\fpmax \u223c m\u03bd vrot and vrot \u223c 220 km/s is the Galactic rotation speed. A somewhat\nbetter limit comes from the requirement that during the gravitational collapse the\nneutrino phase space density does not increase. Therefore the overdensity of relic\nneutrinos is small and one expects in this model a rather pronounced GZK-cutoff.\n2. Since the interaction probability for a UHE neutrino in the neutrino halo is\nsmall, a large neutrino flux is needed to produce the observed UHECR. The limit\non horizontal EAS set by the Fly's Eye experiment [40] limits therefore severely\nthis model: Ref. [41] found that the neutrino spectrum has to be extremely flat,\ndN/dE \u221d E \u2212\u03b3 with spectral index \u03b3 < 1.2. Even if one assumes a large neutrino\nenhancement factor due to a lepton asymmetric Universe, the spectrum has to be\nmuch flater, \u03b3 < 1.8, than expected from astrophysical sources.\n3. The observed UHECR flux implies an upper bound on the UHE neutrino\nflux produced in astrophysical sources which are not hidden. If UHE neutrinos\nannihilating on relic neutrinos contribute significantly to the observed UHECR at\n\u223c 1020 eV, a new class of UHE neutrino source has to be invoked which is optically\nthick for nucleons. The energy generation of these sources was estimated to be\ncomparable to the total photon luminosity of the Universe [42].\n\nB\n\nUHE neutrino and weak-scale string theories\n\nMost models introducing new physics at a scale M to produce large cross-sections\nfor UHE neutrinos fail because experiments generally constrain M to be larger\n> mZ , and unitarity limits cross-sections to be O(\u03c3tot ) \u223c\n<\nthan the weak scale, M \u223c\n2 <\n2\n1/M \u223c 1/mZ . String theories with large extra dimensions [43] are different in\nthis respect: if the SM particles are confined to the usual 3 + 1-dimensional space\nand only gravity propagates in the higher-dimensional space, the compactification\nradius R of the large extra dimensions can be large, corresponding to a small scale\n1/R of new physics. The weakness of gravitational interactions is a consequence of\nthe large compactification radius, since Newton's constant is then given by G\u22121\nN =\n\u03b4+2\n\u03b4\n8\u03c0R MD , where \u03b4 is the number of extra dimensions and MD \u223c TeV is the\nfundamental mass scale. Such a scenario is naturally realized in theories of open\nstrings, where SM particles correspond to open strings beginning and ending on\nD-branes, whereas gravitons correspond to closed strings which can propagate in\nthe higher-dimensional space. From a four-dimensional point of view the higher\ndimensional graviton in these theories appears as an infinite tower of Kaluza-Klein\n(KK) excitations with mass squared m~2n = ~n2 /R2 . Since the weakness of the\ngravitational interaction is partially compensated by the large number of KK states\nand cross-sections of reactions mediated by spin 2 particles are increasing rapidly\nwith energy, it has been argued in Refs. [37,38] that neutrinos could initiate the\nobserved vertical showers at the highest energies.\nIn the calculations of Refs. [38,44] it was assumed that the massless fourdimensional graviton and \u221a\nits massive KK excitations couple with the usual gravi\u22121\ntational strength M Pl = 8\u03c0/MPl .

However, it has been pointed\nout [45] that due to brane fluctuations the effective coupling g~n of the level ~n KK\nmode to four-dimensional fields is suppressed exponentially,\n1\nc m2\ng~n =\nexp \u2212 2~n\nMst\nM Pl\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere c is a constant of order 1 or larger, which parametrises the effects of a finite\nbrane tension [45], and Mst \u223c MD is the string scale2 . This exponential suppression\nthereby provides a dynamical cutoff in the sum over all KK modes.\nIn Fig. 4, the cross-sections obtained in Ref. [47] due to KK exchange are shown\nfor three different values of Mst together with the charged-current cross-section\nKK\nof the SM. It is clear that even for \u03c3N\n\u03bd = 10 mbarn a value of Mst not much\nabove 1 TeV is required. While present collider experiments do not exclude this\n> 50 TeV [48]. The latter limit was obtained for\npossibility, SN 1987A gives MD \u223c\n< 10 TeV\na rather conservative choice of supernova parameters, and therefore MD \u223c\n2)\n\nA similar suppression of the coupling to higher KK modes was found also in Ref.

Energy transfer y in the subreactions with W -exchange (CC), exchange of KK\ngravitons with quarks (q) and gluons (g) as function of log(E\u03bd /eV) for Mst = 6 TeV, \u03b4 = 2 and\nc = 1.\n\nseems to be incompatible with SN 1987A even allowing for rather large astrophysical\nuncertainties.\nThe second important quantity characterising the development of an air shower\nbesides \u03c3tot is the energy transfer y = (E\u03bd \u2212 E\u03bd\u2032 )/E\u03bd . In contrast to charged-current\nscattering where the electromagnetic shower initiated by the charged lepton is practically indistinguishable from a hadronic shower, only the hit nucleon can initiate\nan air shower in KK scattering. Therefore, even a neutrino with large \u03c3tot will behave like a penetrating particle if it does not transfer a large fraction of its energy\nper interaction to the shower. In Fig. 5, the energy transfer y is shown as function\nof E\u03bd . At energies of interest, E\u03bd \u2248 1020 eV, the transferred energy fraction is\nonly around y \u2248 0.1, i.e., much smaller than y \u2248 0.6 typical of nucleon-nucleon\ncollisions.\nLet us now discuss in a very general way how large the total cross-section of a\nUHE primary able to produce the observed vertical air showers should be. The\nsurvival probability N at atmospheric depth X of a primary with mean free path\n\u03bb = mair /\u03c3tot is N(X) = exp(\u2212X/\u03bb), where mair \u2248 2.4 * 10\u221224 g is the weight of an\n\"average\" air atom. Hence, the probability distribution p of the first interaction\npoint X1 has its maximum at p(X1 ) = \u03bb.\nFor a proton with energy E = 1020 eV, the mean free path is \u03bbp \u2248 40g/cm2 and\nthus a proton air shower is indeed initiated in the top of the atmosphere. After\nthe first interaction, the number of particles in the shower grows until it reaches its\nmaximum at Xmax \u2248 800 g/cm2 . Hence, a vertical proton air shower needs almost\n\n\fthe complete atmosphere for its development.\nHow would this picture change for a neutrino with \u03bb\u03bd = 10\u03bbp , i.e., \u03c3tot =\n15 mbarn? Taking into account only the delayed start of the shower shifts the\nshower maximum already \u2248 360 g/cm2 downwards in the atmosphere. The small\nenergy fraction transferred to the shower by each interaction delays the shower\ndevelopment even further. Additionally, the fluctuations of a neutrino shower are\nenhanced compared to a proton shower. Hence, the shower evolution is clearly\ndifferent from a proton shower. Therefore even neutrino-nucleon cross-sections as\nlarge as 15 mbarn due to KK exchange are not sufficient to explain vertical air\nshowers by neutrino primaries.\nFinally, we want to discuss the high-energy\n\u221a behaviour of the total cross-section\n\u03c3tot . A partial-wave analysis shows that at s = O(Mst ) the amplitude of \u03bd + q \u2192\n\u03bd + q starts to violate unitarity. At the same energy scale, one expects that the\nKK\nKK\neffective theory used to derive \u03c3N\n\u03bd breaks down and that the growth of \u03c3N \u03bd is\nslowed down. In this case, the results shown in Fig. 4 would be an upper bound\nKK\nKK\n2\nfor \u03c3N\n\u03bd . Since a calculation of \u03c3N \u03bd valid for s \u226b Mst within string theory seems\nat present not to be feasible, it is interesting to ask if general principles uch as\nunitarity can be used at all as guidelines.\nKhuri considered potential scattering on R3 \u2297 S 1 as a toy model for string theory\nwith one large extra dimension in Ref. [49]. He showed that analytical properties of the forward scattering amplitude Tnn (s, t = 0), which are true in R3 , do\nnot necessarily hold in R3 \u2297 S 1 for n > 0. At least in this specific example however, the forward scattering amplitude for n = 0 (\"SM particles\") has the usual\nanalytical properties known from R3 . If this would hold true generally, then the\nRegge approach together with the eikonal method to ensure unitarity should give\nan idea of the high-energy behaviour of \u03c3tot . A general Regge amplitude AR can\nbe represented by\nAR (s, t) = \u03b2(t)s\u03b1(t) ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the exponent \u03b1(t) is given by the relation between spin \u03c3i = int[\u03b1(t)] and\nmass m2i = t of the particles lying on the leading Regge trajectory contributing\nto the reaction. In our case, the intercept \u03b1(0) of this trajectory is equal to the\nspin of the massless graviton, \u03b1(0) = 2. String theory suggests that the Regge\ntrajectories are linear, \u03b1(t) = \u03b10 + \u03b1\u2032 t, and that their slope is given by the string\ntension, \u03b1\u2032 = 1/(4\u03c0Mst2 ). The residue\n\u03b2(t) = \u2212 exp(\u2212i\u03b1(t)\u03c0/2) eat\n\n(5)\n\ncontains the phase of the amplitude and the Reggeon coupling \u221d exp(at), for which\nEq. (3) gives a = c/Mst2 . In d = 4 dimensions, the energy dependence of the total\ncross-section follows as \u03c3tot (s) \u221d ln2 (s) [47]. The results of Ref. [50] suggest that\nfor s \u226b Mst2 and \u03b4 extra dimensions, ln2 (s/s0 ) should be replaced by ln2+\u03b4 (s/s0 ).\n\n\fVI\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nSuperheavy, metastable relic particles is the most promising source in the framework of top\u2013down models. Its cleanest signature is the galactic anisotropy which\nshould be easily detectable by a detector in the southern hemisphere as AUGER.\nExperimentally more difficult signatures are the high photon/proton ratio and the\ndetection of the predicted large UHE neutrino fluxes via horizontal EAS. All top\u2013\ndown models predict also an appreciable LSP flux if R-parity is conserved.\nAlso in theories with large extra dimensions, neutrinos behave as deeply penetrating particles and are therefore not responsible for the observed UHECR events.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nI am grateful to V.
