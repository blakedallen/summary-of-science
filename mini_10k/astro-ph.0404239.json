The main\nobjectives of this project are twofold: (1) Mapping out the large scale structures in and around\nthe clusters on 10\u201314 Mpc scale to study the hierarchical growth of clusters through assembly of\nsurrounding groups. (2) Investigating the environmental variation of galaxy properties along the\nstructures to study the origin of the morphology-density and star formation-density relations.\nSome initial results are presented.\nOn galactic scale, we first present the stellar mass growth of cluster galaxies out to z \u223c\n1.5 based on the near-infrared imaging of distant clusters and show that the mass assembly\nprocess of galaxies is largely completed by z \u223c 1.5 and is faster than the current semi-analytic\nmodels' predictions. We then focus on the faint end of the luminosity function at z \u223c 1 based\non the Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Survey imaging data. We show the deficit of red galaxies\nbelow M\u2217 +2 or 1010 M\u2299 , which suggest less massive galaxies are either genuinely young or still\nvigorously forming stars in sharp contrast to the massive galaxies where mass is assembled and\nstar formation is terminated long time ago.\n\n1. Panoramic Imaging and Spectroscopy of Cluster Evolution with\nSubaru (PISCES)\nPISCES is a panoramic imaging survey of distant clusters using the Subaru wide-field\noptical camera Suprime-Cam which provides 34\u2032 \u00d727\u2032 field of view corresponding to a\nphysical area of 16\u00d713 Mpc2 at z \u223c 1. This long term project has started since 2003,\nand we aim to target \u223c15 X-ray selected distant clusters in total at 0.4 <\n\u223c 1.3, in good\n\u223cz <\ncoordination with ACS/HST, XMM, and Chandra observations. This unique project is\ncurrently underway and some preliminary results on the large scale structures over the entire Suprime-Cam fields are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. These two rich clusters at z=0.55 and\n0.83 were imaged in multi optical bands, and photometric redshifts (Kodama et al. 1999)\nhave been applied to efficiently remove foreground/background contaminations and isolate the cluster member candidates (c.f. Kodama et al. 2001). Many substructures are\nthen clearly seen around the main body of the clusters which tend to be aligned in filamentary structures extending to >10 Mpc scale across. Although these structures should\nbe confirmed spectroscopically later on, these already provide good evidence for cluster\nscale assembly in the hierarchical Universe.\nThe large scale structures that we see around the clusters provide us the unique\nopportunities to look into the environmental effects on galaxies as they assemble to\ndenser regions. Kodama et al. (2001) have presented the environmental dependence of\n1\n\n\f2\n\nT. Kodama et al.\n\nFigure 1. The panoramic maps of CL0016+16 cluster (z=0.55; left panel) and RXJ0152.7\u22121357\n(z=0.83; right panel). 10 arcminutes correspond to physical scales of 3.8 and 4.6 Mpc, respectively. Using photometric redshift technique based on multi-colour data (BV Ri\u2032 z \u2032 and V Ri\u2032 z \u2032 ,\nrespectively), plotted are the photometric member candidates selected with redshift cuts of\n0.506z60.58 and 0.786z60.86, respectively. Contours show local 2-D number density of galaxies at 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5 \u03c3 above the mean density. Coordinates are shown relative to the centre of\nthe main cluster. Large scale filamentary structures (>10Mpc) are seen in both clusters.\n\nFigure 2. The same as Fig. 1, but only red galaxies on the colour-magnitude sequence are\nshown rather than phot-z selected galaxies. The red galaxies are selected on the basis of V Ri\u2032\ncolours for CL0016+16 and Ri\u2032 z \u2032 colours for RXJ0152.7\u22121357, respectively, and some red colour\nslice cuts are applied to isolate the passively evolving galaxies at cluster redshifts. This technique\ngives narrower redshift slice (\u2206z\u223c0.05) hence has less projection effect, but tends to be biased\nto the systems dominated by red populations. It is therefore complemental to the phot-z slice\ntechnique used in Fig. 1.\n\ngalaxy colours along the filamentary structures around the CL0939+47 cluster at z=0.41.\nThey have shown that the galaxy colours change rather sharply at relatively low density regions such as galaxy groups along the filaments well outside of the cluster core\nwhere the galaxies have not yet passed the central region of the clusters yet (see also\n\n\fOutskirts of Galaxy Clusters: intense life in the suburbs\n\n3\n\nFigure 3. The variation in colour versus local galaxy density, for phot-z selected cluster members brighter than I = 23.4 in CL0939+47 cluster at z = 0.41 (Kodama et al. 2001). The open\ncircles and filled triangles show the galaxies brighter or fainter than I = 21.4 (MV\u2217 +2), respectively. The three red lines represent the loci of the 25, 50, and 75th percentile colours. The local\nnumber density is calculated from the 10 nearest galaxies and we correct this for residual field\ncontamination in the photometric members using the blank field data.\n\nGray et al. 2004; Treu et al. 2003). Together with the similar findings in the local Universe (Lewis et al. 2002; Gomez et al. 2003). the environmental effects that truncate star\nformation are not driven by the cluster specific mechanism such as ram-pressure stripping (Abadi et al. 1999) and but are found to be much wider spread into low density\nregions. We should therefore pay greater attention to galaxy groups as the key hierarchy\nfor the environmental effects and try to identify what is happening on galaxies in this\nenvironment (see below). It is also important to extend this analysis to higher redshifts\nas the galaxy environment should change dramatically during the course of vigorous\nassembly, which is probably related to the appearance of morphology-density relation\n(Dressler 1980).\nObviously, taking as many spectra as possible from the photometrically identified large\nscale structures is crucial to prove their reality, since our photometric approach may\nwell suffer from the projection effect along the line of site as we go to lower density\nregions due to the broad phot-z slice cuts that we apply. Importantly, Oii line and/or the\n4000\u00c5 break feature are detectable for our PISCES targets in the optical spectroscopy\n(such as FOCAS) and H\u03b1 line comes to the FMOS window (0.9\u03bcm<\u03bb<1.8\u03bcm). Not\nonly definitively removing the foreground/background contamination and identifying the\nphysically associated real groups, spectroscopic redshifts of individual cluster members\nwill also provide us two critical information: (1) Dynamical mass of the systems which\ncan then be compared to lensing mass and the X-ray mass to address the dynamical\nstate of the systems. (2) 3-D velocity structures, providing the recent and/or near future\ncluster-cluster/cluster-group merger histories (e.g. Czoske et al. 2002).\nAlso, Oii and H\u03b1 lines will offer the measures of on-going star formation rate of\ngalaxies. (The latter is preferred since it is much less affected by dust extinction or\nmetallicity variation (Kennicutt et al. 1984)). Therefore we can directly identify when,\nwhere and on what timescale the star formation is truncated as the galaxies/groups fall\ninto clusters along the filaments (e.g. Kodama et al. 2004b). Moreover, we will combine\nthe information from other spectral indices such as Balmer lines and colours in order to\n\n\f4\n\nT. Kodama et al.\n\nFigure 4. Stellar mass functions of galaxies in clusters as a function of redshift. The Kennicutt's\ninitial mass function (Kennicutt 1983) is used to scale the stellar mass. The open diamonds and\nthe filled triangles show the stellar mass functions for z \u223c 1 and z \u223c 1.5 clusters, respectively,\nwhich are compared to the local counterpart from the 2MASS survey (dot-dashed curve). All\nthe curves and the data points are normalized at 5\u00d71010 M\u2299 so as to have the same amplitude.\nThe theoretical predictions from a semi-analytic model (Nagashima et al. 2002) are presented\nfor comparison, which are made for galaxies in the haloes whose circular velocities are greater\nthan 1000 km/s at each epoch. The mass assembly of massive galaxies in the real Universe is\nmuch faster than the hierarchical model prediction.\n\nresolve the recent star formation histories in galaxies in fine time scales. Different spectral\nfeatures are sensitive to different stellar ages (Kennicutt et al. 1984; Balogh et al. 1999;\nPoggianti et al. 1999): the emission lines (Oii H\u03b1) will measure the amplitude of ongoing star formation (107 yrs), while the Balmer absorption line give the luminosity\n(mass) contribution from the stars formed immediately before the truncation (108\u22129 yrs)\n(Dressler & Gunn 1992; Couch & Sharples 1987) and the 4000\u00c5 break and broad-band\ncolours specify the features of longer-lived populations (>109 yrs) (Kodama & Bower 2001).\nResolving the recent star formation histories in galaxies in the transition regions (groups)\nis the key to understanding the physical processes behind the truncation. In particular,\nthe existence of strong nebular emissions would support the galaxy-galaxy mergers which\ntrigger star-burst, and very strong Balmer absorption line (E+A or k+a) would follow in\nthe post star-burst phase (Poggianti et al. 1999). If the star formation is more gradually\ntruncated (>\n\u223c1Gyr) due to halo gas stripping (strangulation), we would not see any excess\nof E+A/k+a features (Balogh et al. 1999).\nIt is also important to investigate the morphologies of the galaxies in these groups. The\nkey question here is whether the transformation of morphologies is driven by the same\nmechanisms as those responsible for the truncation of star formation (Poggianti et al. 1999;\nTreu et al. 2003). Furthermore, stellar mass function of galaxies (see \u00a72) in groups compared to other environment will provide information on galaxy-galaxy merger in this\nhierarchy since the mergers increase the fraction of massive galaxies. On the contrary,\nstrangulation does not change mass, hence can be distinguished by this test.\n\n2. Stellar mass assembly of massive galaxies in high-z clusters\nWe now move on to the galactic scale, and firstly we present the stellar mass functions\nof galaxies in high-z clusters constructed from deep near-infrared imaging in J and Ks\n\n\fOutskirts of Galaxy Clusters: intense life in the suburbs\n\n5\n\n(Fig. 4) (Kodama & Bower 2003a; Kodama et al. 2003b). The stellar mass function of\ngalaxies derived from the K-band observations is a good tracer of mass assembly history\nof galaxies and therefore provides a critical test for the CDM-based bottom-up picture\n(e.g. Kauffmann & Charlot 1998; Baugh et al. 2002).\nWe have combined two z \u223c 1 clusters (3C336 and Q1335+28; Kodama & Bower 2003a)\nand five z \u223c 1.5 clusters (Q0835+580, Q1126+101, Q1258+404, Q0139\u2013273, and Q2025\u2013\n155; Hall et al. 1998; 2001; Best et al. 2003) to increase statistics. We have subtracted\nthe control field counts taken from the literature (Saracco et al. 1999; Saracco et al. 2001;\nBest et al. 2003). Applying the same technique described in Kodama & Bower et al.\n(2003), we construct the field-subtracted stellar mass functions of galaxies in high-z clusters, primarily using Ks -band flux and also using J \u2212 Ks colour as a measure of the M/L\nratio. As shown, little evolution is observed since z = 1.5 to the present-day (2MASS\nclusters; Balogh et al. 2001), indicating that the mass assembly on galaxy scale is largely\ncompleted by z \u223c 1.5 in the cluster environment. This epoch of mass assembly of massive\ngalaxies is earlier than the prediction of the hierarchical models as shown for comparison\n(Nagashima et al. 2002).\nIt is interesting to apply similar analyses for the general field, since the high density\nregions may be the special places where galaxy formation processes take place in an\naccelerated way. Recently, Pozzetti et al.(2003) and Glazebrook et al.(2004) investigated\nthe stellar mass growth of massive galaxies out to z \u223c 1.5 based on the large (mostly)\nspectroscopic sample in K20 (52 arcmin2 ) and GDDS (120 arcmin2 ), respectively, and\nfound no or little evolution is seen in the stellar mass of massive galaxies, suggesting the\nearly assembly of galaxies even in the general field environment.\nIt is also important to go even higher redshifts to firstly identify the epoch of assembly of massive galaxies when they start to break down into pieces. Recent deep\nNIR observations in fact start to enter such formation epoch (e.g. Dickonson et al. 2003;\nFranx et al. 2003; Rudnick et al. 2003; Daddi et al. 2003), and this aspect will be further extended by on-going and near future space missions such as SIRTF (Dickonson et al. 2002;\nPozzetti et al., 2003) and Astro-F (Japanese mission).\n\n3. Down-sizing in galaxy formation seen at z \u223c 1\nIt is known that the galaxy properties depend on mass or luminosity as well. Using the\nSDSS data, Kauffmann et al. (2003) and Baldry et al., (2004) have shown an interesting\nbreak mass at 3\u00d71010 M\u2299 above which the dominant population is red passively evolving\ngalaxies, while below that mass the contribution of blue active galaxies become dominant.\nMorphological mix of galaxies is also known to be strongly luminosity (or stellar mass)\ndependent (e.g. Treu et al. 2003). It is therefore indicative that the formation of massive\ngalaxies and less massive galaxies are quite different, in the sense that massive and/or\nearly-type galaxies form early in the Universe, while dwarf and/or late-type galaxies form\nlater on average or still forming stars at present. The mass dependent star formation\nhistory is referred to as \"down-sizing\" (Cowie et al. 1996).\nGiven the down-sizing effect in the local Universe, as we look back into higher redshift\nUniverse, we expect to go beyond the formation epoch of small galaxies or towards\nthe early stage of their formation, as well as to approach the formation epoch of more\nmassive galaxies. To test this hypothesis, we investigate the galaxy colours at z \u223c 1\nas a function of luminosity (or stellar mass) utilizing the unique Suprime-Cam imaging\ndata-set (BRi\u2032 z \u2032 ) on the Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Survey (SXDS). These data are\n\u2032\nboth sufficiently deep (zAB\n=25, 6-10\u03c3) and wide (1.2 deg2 ), which enable us for the\nfirst time to investigate the photometric properties of statistical sample of galaxies at\n\n\f6\n\nT. Kodama et al.\n\nFigure 5. Field-corrected colour-magnitude diagram for the z \u223c 1 galaxies in high\ndensity regions in SXDS (Kodama et al. 2004a). The solid line show the expected location of colour-magnitude sequence at z \u223c 1 assuming a passive evolution with zform =5\n(Kodama et al. 1998). The deficit of both blue galaxies at the bright/massive end and the deficit\nof red galaxies at the faint/less-massive end are both clearly identified. The stellar masses are\nscaled using the Kennicutt's IMF (Kennicutt 1983).\n\nz \u223c 1 down to \u223cM \u2217 +3 with respect to the passive evolution. We first identify five z \u223c 1\nhigh density regions by applying colour cuts at 1.7<R\u2212z \u2032<2.0 and 0.8<i\u2032 \u2212z \u2032 <1.1, which\ncorrespond to the colours of passively evolving galaxies at z \u223c 1 (Kodama et al. 1998).\nWe then combine these five regions (amounting to 141 arcmin2 in total) and subtract off\nthe low density regions at z \u223c 1 sampled from the same data-set and scaled to the same\narea. We do this subtraction on the colour-magnitude diagram (Kodama & Bower 2001)\nand isolate the z \u223c 1 galaxies in a statistical sense. This method should work since\nboth high and low density regions at z \u223c 1 are expected to have the same amount of\nforeground/background contaminations.\nThe field-corrected colour-magnitude diagram thus constructed for z \u223c 1 galaxies in\nhigh density regions is shown in Fig. 5. The most striking feature in the galaxy distribution on this diagram is that the galaxies are separated into two distinct populations,\n'bright+red' and 'faint+blue'. More precisely, we show a deficit of red and faint galaxies\nbelow M \u2217 +2 or 1010 M\u2299 in stellar mass and a lack of blue massive galaxies above M \u2217 \u22120.5\nor 8\u00d71010 M\u2299 in stellar mass. The down-sizing in star formation is therefore also seen at\nhigh redshift, where star formation in massive galaxies takes place early in the Universe\nand is already truncated by z \u223c 1, while almost all of small galaxies are still forming\nstars at z \u223c 1 (Kodama et al. 2004a; Poggianti et al. 2004; see also De Lucia et al. in\nthis volume). Together with the early-assembly of massive galaxies see in \u00a7 2, galaxy\nformation does in fact take place in \"down-sizing\" fashion as apparently opposed to the\n\"bottom-up\" scenario. Some critical physical mechanisms in galaxy formation may be\nstill missing in the current models.\nIt is important to note that there are two possible interpretations for the blue colours\nof faint galaxies. One is that they are just forming, and the other is that they have\nmuch extended star formation over the long period of time. To separate out these two\npossibilities, the key quantity to measure is the so-called birth-rate parameter (b) of these\nfaint blue galaxies (Kennicutt 1988). Here b\u2032 is re-defined as on-going star formation rate\n\n\fOutskirts of Galaxy Clusters: intense life in the suburbs\n\n7\n\ndivided by integrated stellar mass of the system (b\u2032 =SF R/Mstars ). SF R can be derived\nfrom Oii and H\u03b1 line intensities by spectroscopy or narrow-band imaging of the PISCES\nclusters and the SXDS field while Mstars can be obtained from the deep NIR imaging.\nThis parameter describes what phase of star formation each galaxy is in, and therefore\ncan discriminate between genuinely young galaxies formed recently (large b\u2032 ) and star\nforming galaxies formed long time ago (small b\u2032 ). It is also interesting to directly detect\nthe brightening of the break luminosity or mass with increasing redshift by going even\nhigher redshifts.\nReferences\nAbadi, M. G., Moore, B., Bower, R.
