INTRODUCTION\n\nAt very high energies corresponding to very small values of Bjorken x variable the density of partons in\nthe hadronic and nuclear wave functions is believed to become very large reaching the saturation limit [1\u20134].\nIn the saturation regime the growth of partonic structure functions with energy slows down sufficiently to\nunitarize the total hadronic cross sections. The gluonic fields in the saturated hadronic or nuclear wave\nfunction are very strong [5,6]. A transition to the saturation region can be characterized by the saturation\nscale Q2s (s), which is related to the typical two dimensional density of the partons' color charge in the\ninfinite momentum frame of the hadronic or nuclear wave function [4\u20136]. The saturation scale Q2s (s) is an\nincreasing function of energy s and of the atomic number of the nucleus A [7\u201317]. At high enough energies\nor for sufficiently large nuclei the saturation scale becomes much larger than \u039b2QCD allowing for perturbative\ndescription of the scattering process at hand [4,18]. The presence of intrinsic large momentum scale Qs\njustifies the use of perturbative QCD expansion even for such a traditionally non-perturbative observables\nas total hadronic cross sections.\nRecently there has been a lot of activity devoted to calculating hadronic and nuclear structure functions in\nthe saturation regime. The original calculation of quark and gluon distribution functions including multiple\nrescatterings without QCD evolution in a large nucleus was performed in [3]. The resulting Glauber-Mueller\nformula provided us with expressions for the partonic structure functions which reach saturation at small Q2 .\nMcLerran and Venugopalan has argued in [4] that the large density of gluons in the partonic wave functions\nat high energy allows one to approximate the gluon field of a large hadron or nucleus by a classical solution of\nthe Yang-Mills equations. The resulting gluonic structure functions has been shown to be equivalent to the\nGlauber-Mueller approach [5,6,19]. An important problem which still remained was the inclusion of quantum\nQCD evolution in this quasi-classical expression for the structure functions. The problem was equivalent\nto resummation of the multiple BFKL pomeron [20] exchanges. The evolution equation resumming leading\nlogarithms of energy (\u03b1s ln s) and the multiple pomeron exchanges was written in [7] using the dipole model\n\n1\n\n\fof [8] and independently in [10] using the effective high energy lagrangian approach. The equation was\nwritten for the cross section of a quark-antiquark dipole scattering on a target hadron or nucleus, which, in\nturn can yield us the F2 structure function of the target. The latter can be written as\nZ 2\nd rd\u03b1 \u03b3 \u2217 \u2192qq\u0304\nQ2\n2\n(1)\n\u03a6\n(r, \u03b1) d2 b N (r, b, Y ),\nF2 (x, Q ) =\n4\u03c0 2 \u03b1EM\n2\u03c0\n\u2217\n\nwith \u03a6\u03b3 \u2192qq\u0304 (r, \u03b1) the wave function of a virtual photon in deep inelastic scattering (DIS) splitting in a\nq q\u0304 with\ntransverse separation r and the fraction of photon's longitudinal momentum carried by the quark\n\u2217\n\u03b1. \u03a6\u03b3 \u2192qq\u0304 (r, \u03b1) is a very well known function and could be found for instance in [7,12,18]. The quantity\nN (r, b, Y ) has a meaning of a forward scattering amplitude of a dipole with transverse size r at impact\nparameter b with rapidity Y on a target proton or nucleus normalized in such a way that the total cross\nsection for the process is given by\nZ\nqq\u0304A\n(2)\n\u03c3tot\n= 2 d2 b N (r, b, Y ).\nThe evolution equation for N closes only in the large-Nc limit of QCD [10,11] and reads [7,8]\n\u0014\n\u0013 \u0015\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0014\nZ\n4\u03b1CF\n\u03b1CF Y\nx01\nx01\n4\u03b1CF\nY + 2\n(Y \u2212 y)\nln\nln\ndy exp \u2212\nN (x01 , b, Y ) = \u2212\u03b3(x01 , b) exp \u2212\n\u03c0\n\u03c1\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u03c1\n0\n\u00d7\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1\n\nd2 x2\n\n1\n1\n1\nx201\n[2 N (x02 , b + x12 , y) \u2212 N (x02 , b + x12 , y) N (x12 , b + x02 , y)],\n2\n2\nx02 x12\n2\n2\n2\n\n(3)\n\nwith the initial condition set by \u03b3(x01 , b), which is the propagator of a dipole of size x01 at the impact\nparameter b through the target nucleus or hadron. \u03b3 was taken to be of Mueller-Glauber form in [7]:\n2\n\nquark2\n\n\u03b3(x01 , b0 ) = e\u2212x01 Q0s\n\n/4\n\n\u2212 1,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere for a spherical nucleus [3,19,21]\nx201 Qquark2\n0s\n\n=\n\nx201\n\n\u221a\n4\u03c0 2 \u03b1s R2 \u2212 b2\n\u03c1 xG(x, 1/x201 ),\nNc\n\n(5)\n\nwith \u03c1 = A/[(4/3)\u03c0R3 ] the density of the atomic number A. The gluon distribution in Eq. (5) should be\ntaken at the two-gluon order\nxG(x, 1/x2 ) =\n\n\u03b1s CF\n1\nln 2 2 ,\n\u03c0\nx \u03bc\n\n(6)\n\nwith \u03bc some infrared cutoff. The scale Qquark2\nhas the meaning of the quasi-classical quark saturation scale\n0s\ngenerated by multiple rescatterings prior to the inclusion of evolution. Eqs. (1) and (3) provide us with the\nF2 structure function and the total cross section of DIS on a nucleus including all multiple BFKL pomeron\nexchanges (fan diagrams). In spite of several attempts to solve Eq. (3) analytically, which provided us with\na well-understood high and low energy asymptotics for N [7,12,11], the exact analytical solution is still\nto be found. There exist several numerical solutions to Eq. (3) demonstrating that at very high energies\nthe amplitude N goes to an independent of energy constant (N \u2192 1) thus unitarizing the total DIS cross\nsections [12,13,16,17]. The numerical analyses also show that Eq. (3) does generate a momentum scale Qs\nwhich rapidly increases with energy. This scale justified the small coupling \u03b1s expansion and helps avoid\nthe problem of infrared instability of BFKL equation. An effort to calculate the NLO correction to Eq. (3)\nis currently under way [22].\nSeveral other observables could be calculated in the framework of the saturation approach to hadronic and\nnuclear collisions. Of the exclusive observables diffractive (or, more precisely, elastic) cross section has been\ncalculated in the quasi-classical limit in [23]. The evolution equation including multiple pomeron exchanges\nhas been recently written for the cross section of single diffractive dissociation in [24].\n2\n\n\fIn this paper we are interested in inclusive particle production cross sections. In the saturation framework\nthese cross sections have been extensively studied at the classical level in DIS, proton\u2013nucleus (pA) and\nnucleus\u2013nucleus (AA) collisions. The inclusive gluon production cross section for pA and AA in the weak\nclassical field limit (lowest order in perturbation theory without multiple rescatterings) has been calculated\nin [25], reproducing the result of Gunion and Bertsch [26]. In the strong field limit including all multiple\nrescatterings but no QCD evolution the gluon production cross section was calculated for pA in [19]. This\nresult has been recently reproduced in [27\u201329]. The inclusive gluon production cross section for DIS was\ncalculated in [21], with the resulting expression being slightly different from a straightforward generalization\nof the pA result of [19]. Finally an important problem for heavy ion physics is the calculation of the inclusive\ngluon production cross section in AA, which would provide us with the initial conditions for the possible\nformation of quark-gluon plasma. Numerical estimates of the related gluon multiplicities were performed in\n[30], while an analytical ansatz has been proposed in [31].\nThe problem of inclusion of nonlinear evolution in the inclusive cross sections received much less attention\nin the literature. The case of heavy flavor production in DIS with nonlinear evolution has been solved in\n[32]. The inclusive gluon production in DIS has been studied in [33,34] using the AGK cutting rules [35] and\nkT -factorization approach.\nIn this paper we calculate the single inclusive gluon production cross section in DIS including the effects of\nmultiple rescatterings and nonlinear evolution of Eq. (3). We begin in Sect. II by reviewing the derivation of\nthe formula for the single inclusive gluon production cross section in the quasi-classical approximation given\nin [21]. In the quasi-classical approximation the quantum evolution is not included since one is interested in\nresummation of multiple rescatterings [5,19]. Each multiple rescattering of the produced gluon on a nucleon\nin the nucleus brings in a factor of \u03b12s A1/3 and the quasi-classical approximation can be defined as resumming\npowers of this parameter [5,18,19,31]. The result for gluon production cross section is shown in Eq. (12).\nWe continue in Sect. III by including the effects of nonlinear dipole evolution from Eq. (3) in the expression\nfor the cross section. The philosophy of our approach is similar to [7]. We first construct a classical GlauberMueller\u2013type expression for the inclusive cross section and then use it as our starting point for including\ndipole evolution. We are working in the rest frame of the target, which allows to consider the quantum\nevolution in energy as happening only in the wave function of the incoming q q\u0304 pair [7,10]. In Sect. IIIA we\nanalyze the evolution preceding the emission of the gluon that we measure in the final state. This evolution\ncorresponds to emission of gluons with larger (harder) light cone component of momentum than the one\ncarried by the gluon that we trigger. We show that this early evolution can only be linear (single pomeron\nexchange) leading to creation of the dipole in which our measured gluon is emitted. This conclusion is in\nagreement with the prediction of AGK cutting rules for inclusive cross section [33\u201336]. In Sect. IIIB we\nproceed by analyzing the emissions of the gluons which are softer than the measured one. We demonstrate\nthat the effect of these later emissions can be incorporated in the inclusive cross section by replacing the\nGlauber-Mueller exponents in Eq. (12) with the evolved forward amplitudes of a gluon (adjoint) dipole\nscattering on the target. The final expression for inclusive gluon production cross section in DIS is given by\nEq. (30) in Sect. IIIC which is the main result of this paper.\nWe begin analyzing the cross section of Eq. (30) in Sect. IV by observing that in the case of a very large\nnucleus corresponding to zero momentum transfer in each of the exchanged pomerons it can be rewritten\nin a factorized form as a convolution of two functions with Lipatov's effective vertex inserted in the middle\n(see Eq. (39)). In this form it almost agrees with the expression derived by Braun in [34] using the AGK\nrules and pomeron fan diagram approach (see Eq. (10) in [34]). To obtain the expression given in [34]\nfrom our Eq. (39) one has to replace in it the evolved forward amplitude of an adjoint dipole on the target\nnucleus NG by the similar amplitude for the fundamental dipole N . While the difference seems minor in the\nweak field limit given by the linear evolution equations, it becomes much more profound in the transition to\nthe saturation region where the quantities NG and N obey different evolution equations while approaching\nthe same high energy asymptotics. In Sect. V we study the transverse momentum spectrum and energy\ndependence of the obtained cross section. We observe that while at very large k\u22a5 the cross section exhibits\n4\n2\nthe usual 1/k\u22a5\nbehavior it softens to 1/k\u22a5\nin the small k\u22a5 \u223c Qs region similarly to the quasi-classical cross\nsections of [19,21]. The rapidity distribution of the produced gluons may have a maximum which position\nis determined by the values of the produced gluon's momentum k\u22a5 and photon's virtuality Q (see Fig. 7).\nWe conclude in Sect. VI by discussing the general principles of inclusion of nonlinear evolution in the cross\nsections for various inclusive processes. We present an ansatz for the multiplicity distribution of the produced\ngluons in nucleus\u2013nucleus collisions (AA) including the effects of nonlinear evolution in both colliding nuclei.\n\n3\n\n\fII. INCLUSIVE CROSS SECTION IN THE QUASI\u2013CLASSICAL APPROXIMATION\n\nIn this Section we will review the derivation of the single inclusive gluon production cross section in DIS\nfrom [21] in the quasi-classical approximation developed in [19]. The gluon production cross section in DIS\ncan be rewritten as\nZ\nqq\u0304A\n\u03b3 \u2217 A\u2192qq\u0304GX\nd\u03c3\u0302incl\nd\u03c3incl\n1\n2\n\u03b3 \u2217 \u2192qq\u0304\n,\n\u03b1)\n(7)\n=\n(x ),\nd\nx\nd\u03b1\n\u03a6\n(x\n01\n01\nd2 k dy\n2\u03c0 2\nd2 k dy 01\nqq\u0304A\nwhere d\u03c3\u0302incl\n/d2 k dy(x01 ) is the gluon production cross section for the scattering of a dipole of transverse size\nx01 = x0 \u2212 x1 on the target. We want to calculate this observable including all multiple rescatterings of the\nq q\u0304 pair and the produced gluon on the nucleons in the target nucleus. In the quasi-classical approximation\neach rescattering happens via one or two gluon exchanges with the nucleon [19]. We assume that the initial\nquark-antiquark pair is moving in the \"+\" light cone direction. The diagrams contributing to the gluon\nproduction cross section in the A+ = 0 light cone gauge are shown in Fig. 1.\n\nx_ 0\n_z 2\n\n_z 1\nk_\nx\n_1\nnucleus\nnucleons\n\nA\nx_ 0\n_z 2\n\n_z 1\nk_\nx\n_1\n\nB\nx_ 0\n_z 1\n\n_z 2\n\nk_\nx\n_1\n\nC\nFIG. 1. Gluon production in DIS in the quasi-classical approximation. The produced gluon may be emitted either\noff the quark or off the antiquark lines both in the amplitude and in the complex conjugate amplitude. Only one\nconnection is shown.\n\n4\n\n\fSimilar to [19,21,27\u201329,31] the gluon emission can happen via two possible scenarios: the incoming dipole\nmay have the gluon fluctuation in its wave function by the time it hits the target or the gluon may be emitted\nafter the dipole interacts with the target. Even with all the multiple rescatterings the interaction with the\ntarget is instantaneous compared to the typical emission time of the gluon [19]. We thus may denote the\ninteraction time \u03c4 \u2261 x+ = 0. If the gluon emission time in the amplitude is \u03c41 and in the complex conjugate\namplitude is \u03c42 than the following classification of diagrams in Fig. 1 is possible. The graph in Fig. 1A\ncorresponds to the case when \u03c41 < 0 and \u03c42 < 0, while the diagram in Fig. 1B reflects the \u03c41 < 0, \u03c42 > 0\ncase. A \"mirror image\" diagram should be added to Fig. 1B describing the \u03c41 > 0, \u03c42 < 0 case. The late\nemission \u03c41 > 0, \u03c42 > 0 scenario is represented in Fig. 1C. The produced gluon line can start off either quark\nor antiquark lines both in the amplitude and in the complex conjugate amplitude in Fig. 1. We are going to\nsum over all possible emissions while only one case is shown in Fig. 1.\nTo calculate the diagrams in Fig. 1 we will be working in transverse coordinate space with the intent\nto perform a Fourier transform into momentum space in the end. Thus the produced gluon has different\ntransverse coordinates in the amplitude and in the complex conjugate amplitude (z 1 and z 2 ). The dipole\nconsists of the quark at x0 and an antiquark at x1 . Due to real-virtual cancellations only the diagrams where\nthe nucleons interact with the produced gluon survive in Fig. 1A [19]. The square of the gluon's propagator\ncould be easily calculated to give [19]\ne\u2212(z1 \u2212z2 )\nwith\nx\n\n2\n\nQ20s\n\n2\n\nQ20s /4\n\n(8)\n\n\u221a\n8\u03c0 2 \u03b1s Nc R2 \u2212 b2\n= x\n\u03c1 xG(x, 1/|x|2 ).\nNc2 \u2212 1\n2\n\n(9)\n\nThe scale Q20s has the meaning of the gluon saturation scale in the quasi-classical (no evolution) approximation and is different from the quark saturation scale of Eq. (5) by the Casimir operator. In Fig. 1B only the\ninteractions with the gluon line and the antiquark are allowed. Performing the calculation along the lines of\nAppendix A in [19] and adding the \"mirror\" contribution one obtains\n\u2212 e\u2212(z1 \u2212x1 )\n\n2\n\nQ20s /4\n\n\u2212 e\u2212(z2 \u2212x0 )\n\n2\n\nQ20s /4\n\n.\n\n(10)\n\nThe minus sign in Eq. (10) is due to the fact that the gluon is emitted after the interaction on one side of the\ncut in Fig. 1B. Finally the interactions with the nucleons shown in Fig. 1C would have canceled if we were\nconsidering proton-nucleus (or, more precisely, quark-nucleus) collisions as it was done in [19]. However, in\nthe DIS case at hand the quark and antiquark originate from a virtual photon and thus have to be in the\ncolor singlet initial state on both sides of the cut. This condition was not imposed in pA [19,29] where the\ncolor of the interacting quark was assumed to be randomized by the non-perturbative \"intrinsic\" quarks and\ngluons in the proton's wave function [37]. Therefore, unlike the pA case moving an exchanged gluon line\nacross the cut in DIS would modify the color factor of the diagram and thus real-virtual cancellation would\nnot happen. A calculation of the interactions gives\ne\u2212(x0 \u2212x1 )\n\n2\n\nQ20s /4\n\n(11)\n\nfor the diagram in Fig. 1C.\nTo obtain the final answer we now have to combine the terms from Eqs. (8), (10) and (11), multiply by\nthe amplitude of gluon's emission in the original dipole while keeping in mind that the amplitudes in Fig. 1\nare slightly different for different connections of the gluon to the q q\u0304 pair. We then should Fourier transform\nthe expression into momentum space. The final result for the single inclusive gluon production cross section\nof dipole-nucleus scattering in the quasi\u2013classical approximation reads\nZ\n1\nqq\u0304A\nX\nz 2 \u2212 xj\nd\u03c3\u0302incl\nz \u2212 xi\n\u03b1s CF 1\n2\n2\n2\n\u2212ik*(z 1 \u2212z 2 )\n(\u22121)i+j 1\n(x ) =\nd b d z1 d z2 e\n*\n2 |z \u2212 x |2\nd2 k dy 01\n\u03c0 2 (2\u03c0)2\n|z\n\u2212\nx\n|\n1\ni\n2\nj\ni,j=0\n\u0011\n\u0010\n2 2\n2 2\n2 2\n2 2\n\u00d7 e\u2212(xi \u2212xj ) Q0s /4 \u2212 e\u2212(z1 \u2212xj ) Q0s /4 \u2212 e\u2212(z2 \u2212xi ) Q0s /4 + e\u2212(z1 \u2212z2 ) Q0s /4\n\n(12)\n\nwhere b = (x0 + x1 )/2 is the dipole's impact parameter. Together Eqs. (7) and (12) give us the inclusive\ngluon production cross section in DIS in the quasi\u2013classical approximation as derived in [21].\n5\n\n\fIII. INCLUSION OF EVOLUTION EFFECTS\n\nWe are now going to include quantum evolution into Eq. (12). We begin in Sect. IIIA by discussing\nthe evolution preceding the emission of the measured gluon, and continue in Sect. IIIB by analyzing the\nsubsequent evolution. The final expression is derived in Sect. IIIC.\nA. Emission of Harder Gluons\n\nLet us explore how the emission of gluons with the light cone \"plus\" component of the momentum much\nlarger than that of the measured gluon modify the inclusive cross section. For simplicity we first consider\nan emission of a single extra gluon. The diagrams relevant for real emission of this extra gluon are shown in\nFig. 2. Since we are interested in the large-Nc dipole evolution all gluons are represented by double quark\nlines. Notations are explained in Fig. 2A. The incoming original dipole of transverse size x01 = x0 \u2212 x1 emits\na (harder) gluon with transverse coordinate x2 . Then the measured gluon (#3) is emitted in one of the\ncolor dipoles formed by the emission of gluon #2. Since we are interested in keeping this gluon's transverse\nmomentum fixed in the final state its transverse coordinates are different on each side of the cut (x3 and x3\u2032 ).\nEmission in the lower dipole only is shown in Fig. 2. Emission in the upper dipole is completely analogous\nand could be obtained from Fig. 2 by switching gluons 2 and 3.\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nF\n\nG\n\nH\n\nI\n\n0\n2\n3\n\n3'\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n\nFIG. 2. Emission of a harder gluon in the dipole evolution. Gluons are denoted by double lines in the large Nc\nlimit. The produced gluon is marked by a cross.\n\nThe gluon lines in Fig. 2 can connect to either quark or antiquark lines in the dipoles off which they are\nemitted both in the amplitude and in the complex conjugate amplitude. This is shown in Fig. 2 by not\nconnecting the gluon lines to any of the quark line specifically. For instance the gluon #2 can be emitted off\n\n6\n\n\fthe quark line 0 and off the antiquark line 1, which is demonstrated by drawing gluon #2 directly between\nthose quark lines. This notation is the same as the one used in [9,24]. The interactions with the target are\nnot shown explicitly in Fig. 2. Instead we mark with a dashed vertical line in Fig. 2 the moment in light\ncone time \u03c4 = 0 when the multiple rescatterings of Fig. 1 occur (see Fig. 2A). Of course the interactions\nmay happen both in the amplitude and in the complex conjugate amplitude. The solid vertical line in Fig. 2\ndenotes the final state corresponding to \u03c4 = \u221e.\nThe measured gluon #3 is much softer than the gluon #2, k3+ \u226a k2+ , while their transverse momenta\nare not ordered. Thus the lifetime of the gluon #2 is much longer than that of gluon #3. Therefore it seems\nnatural that in all the diagrams considered in Fig. 2 the gluon #2 is emitted before gluon #3 on both sides\nof the cut. However the graphs in Fig. 2 do not cover all the diagrams which need to be considered. There\nis another set of diagrams, predominantly with the virtual emission of gluon #2, some of which are shown\nin Fig. 4, that could be important for gluon production at this order. We are going to first analyze the\ndiagrams in Fig. 2, which would allow us to understand which ones of the diagrams omitted in Fig. 2 should\nbe considered.\nThe transverse momentum k and rapidity y of the measured gluon #3 are kept fixed, while the transverse\nmomentum and rapidity of the other emitted gluon are integrated over. In the spirit of the leading logarithmic\nevolution integration over the rapidity of the gluon #2 is supposed to give us the factor of ln 1/x with x\nthe Bjorken x variable, or, equivalently, a factor of total rapidity interval Y . This factor would make up for\nthe suppression by the power of coupling constant \u03b1s that we have introduced by emitting that gluon. Now\nwe are going to demonstrate that this enhancement does not happen in Figs. 2E\u20132I. That implies that the\ndiagrams in Figs. 2E\u20132I do not give a leading logarithmic contribution and could be neglected as subleading.\n\nk 2 k2+l\np\n\nk3\n\nl\n\nl\np'\n\np''\n\nFIG. 3. One of the diagrams contributing to the class of graphs represented by Fig. 2E.\n\nLet us calculate the diagram in Fig. 3, which is one of the graphs represented by Fig. 2E. The diagrams\nin Fig. 2 are understood to be in the light cone perturbation theory (LCPT) [38], which has been used in\nthe original construction of the QCD dipole model [8]. Therefore we will use the diagrammatic rules of\nLCPT in evaluating the graph Fig. 3. We are working in the frame where the quarks in the original dipole\nhave large \"+\" components of their momenta while the nucleons in the nucleus have large \"\u2212\" momentum\ncomponents. Though only one rescattering is depicted in Fig. 3 our conclusions will be easy to generalize to\ninclude multiple Glauber rescatterings of Fig. 1. The intermediate states are denoted by vertical dotted lines\nin Fig. 3. In estimating the energy denominators of the intermediate states at \u03c4 > 0 one should remember\nthat the \"\u2212\" component of the nucleon's momentum also changes. According to the rules of LCPT the \"\u2212\"\ncomponent of the final state should be equal to the \"\u2212\" component of the initial (incoming) state [38]. Thus\none requires that for the diagram in Fig. 3 the following condition should be satisfied\np\u2032\u2032\u2212 +\n\n(k 2 + l)2\nk2\n+ 3 = p\u2032\u2212 ,\n2k2+\n2k3+\n\n(13)\n\nwhere we have used that for exchanged Coulomb gluons l\u2212 = 0 [5,19]. Using Eq. (13) in evaluating, for\ninstance, the energy denominator of the rightmost intermediate state in Fig. 3 yields [38]\n1\n1\n= (k +l)2\np\u2032\u2032\u2212 \u2212 p\u2032\u2212\n2\n\u2212 2k2+ \u2212\n7\n\nk23\n2k3+\n\n\u2248\n\n1\nk2\n\n3\n\u2212 2k3+\n\n.\n\n(14)\n\n\fWe have used the fact that k3+ \u226a k2+ in the last approximation in Eq. (14). The rule for calculating the\ndiagrams in Fig. 2 could be formulated as follows: the energy denominators for intermediate states with\n\u03c4 > 0 should consist of the sum of the \"\u2212\" momenta components of all the intermediate gluons in the state\nminus the \"\u2212\" momenta components of all the gluons in the final state. (Note that according to the rules\nof LCPT the \"\u2212\" momenta components are not conserved at the vertices and all intermediate lines are on\nmass shell [38].)\nUsing the outlined strategy one can show that the contribution of the diagram in Fig. 3 is proportional to\nZ\n\np+\n\nk3+\n\nZ p+\nX \u01eb\u03bb2 * k \u01eb\u03bb2 * (k + l) (\u01eb\u03bb3 * k )2\nk * (k + l)\nk * (k + l)\n1\n2 2\n2\n3\n2\n3\ndk2+ 22 2 22 2 \u2248 22 2 22\n=\n\u223c\ndk2+\n2 3 2 2\nk\n)\nk\nk\n)\nk\nk\n)\nk\nk\n(k\n(k\n(k\n3+\nk3+\n3\n2 2+\n3\n2 2+\n3\n2 3+\n\u03bb ,\u03bb\n2\n\n(15)\n\n3\n\nwith p+ a large momentum of one of the quarks in the original dipole (k3+ \u226a p+ ). As can be seen from\nEq. (15) the diagram in Fig. 3 does not contain any logarithms of energy. It should be compared to the\ncontribution of, for instance, diagram in Fig. 2A, which is proportional to\nZ p+\n1\np+\n1\n=\nln\n.\n(16)\ndk2+\nA \u223c\nk2+ k3+\nk3+\nk3+\nk3+\nThis diagram is enhanced by extra logarithm of energy (or, equivalently, an extra factor of rapidity) and\nshould be included in our leading logarithmic analysis. In the same approximation the diagram in Fig. 3 is\nsubleading since it does not have a logarithm of energy in it. Similar calculations can be carried out for all the\ndiagrams in Fig. 2E showing that they are subleading and should be neglected. Finally the same conclusion\nwill be reached if one analyzes all diagrams in Figs. 2E\u20132I : they do not bring in an extra logarithm of\nenergy and therefore must be neglected.\nHere we would like to remind the reader about the approximation we are using. It is the same approximation as outlined in [7] for the calculation of total DIS cross section. The (nonlinear) quantum evolution\nresums the powers of \u03b1s Nc Y and is a function of this parameter [8]. (Y is the rapidity variable.) At the same\ntime we are interested in resumming multiple rescatterings, which also bring in extra powers of \u03b1s [5,19,31].\nThe multiple rescatterings are limited to two gluon exchanges with each nucleon. Thus the actual parameter\nwhich is being resummed by multiple rescatterings is \u03b12s A1/3 [5,19,31]. Therefore the combination of leading\nlogarithmic large-Nc evolution and Glauber-Mueller multiple rescatterings resums all powers of both \u03b1s Nc Y\nand \u03b12s A1/3 in the cross sections. From this point of view the diagrams in Figs. 2E\u20132I are suppressed by an\nextra power of \u03b1s Nc not enhanced by an extra power of Y .\nWe have proven that of all graphs in Fig. 2 only diagrams in Figs. 2A\u20132D contribute. Based on this\ninformation one may conjecture that the evolution preceding the emission of the measured gluon consists\nof gluons emitted before interaction both in the amplitude and in the complex conjugate amplitude. To\ncomplete the proof of this statement we have to consider a whole class of diagrams where the line of gluon\n#2 is shorter or of the same length as the line of gluon #3. These diagrams include virtual diagrams where\ngluon #2 is not present in the final state. Many of these diagrams are also subleading, similar to Figs. 2E\u20132I.\nThis can be seen by performing the analysis outlined above and using the rule presented in the Appendix of\n[9] for calculation of virtual contributions. At the end we are left with the diagrams shown in Fig. 4, each of\nwhich gives a leading logarithmic contribution. Not all of the diagrams in Fig. 4 are symmetric with respect\nto horizontal (left-right) mirror reflections. Therefore one should add mirror images to diagrams A\u2013D, F\u2013P\nwhich will be denoted by primes (e.g. A', B', etc.). We note that due to momentum conservation the gluon\n#2 can be emitted only off the quark lines 0 and 1 in the original dipole. Therefore moving part or all of\ngluon #2 across the cut does not change the transverse coordinate (and, therefore, transverse momentum)\nstructure of the diagrams. Using the cancellation of final state interactions demonstrated in [9] we observe\nthat in Fig. 4\nB + C = B\u2032 + C \u2032 = 0\n\n(17a)\n\nD + E + D\u2032 = 0\n\n(17b)\n\nH + I = H\u2032 + I\u2032 = 0\n\n(17c)\n\n8\n\n\fJ + K = J\u2032 + K\u2032 = 0\n\n(17d)\n\nL + M + N = L\u2032 + M \u2032 + N \u2032 = 0\n\n(17e)\n\nP + Q + P \u2032 = 0.\n\n(17f)\n\nWe are left only with the diagrams A, F, G, O and their mirror images A', F', G', O' in Fig. 4.\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nF\n\nG\n\nH\n\nI\n\nJ\n\nK\n\nL\n\nM\n\nN\n\nO\n\nP\n\nQ\n\n0\n2\n3\n\n3'\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n\nFIG. 4. Another set of graphs contributing to emission of a harder gluon in the dipole evolution.\n\n9\n\n\fCombining the results of the analyses of the diagrams in Figs. 2 and 4 we conclude that only the diagrams\nwhere gluon #2 is either emitted or both emitted and absorbed before the interaction at \u03c4 < 0 survive. The\nnon-vanishing diagrams are graphs A\u2013D in Fig. 2 and A, F, G, O, A', F', G', O' in Fig. 4. One can easily\ncheck that these diagrams add up to give us one rung of the linear dipole (or, equivalently, BFKL) evolution.\nThe diagrams A\u2013D in Fig. 2 provide us with the real part of the dipole kernel, splitting the original dipole\n01 in two, in one of which we continue the evolution by emitting the measured gluon #3. Diagrams A, F,\nG, O, A', F', G', O' of Fig. 4 yield us with virtual corrections to the same process.\nNow we are in a position to generalize our conclusions to the case of many harder gluons in the virtual\nphoton's wave function. The evolution preceding the emission of the measured gluon is the usual early-time\ndipole evolution leading to creation at early times (before the interaction, \u03c4 < 0) of the dipole in which the\nmeasured gluon is emitted. The effect of this evolution is to modify the probability of finding this dipole in\nthe virtual photon's wave function.\nThis preceding evolution can only be linear. This can be understood by analyzing diagrams A\u2013D in Fig. 2.\nReal emissions in the dipole model may lead to branching of one dipole evolution into two simultaneous\nevolutions, being thus equivalent to triple pomeron vertices in the traditional language [7,8,13,39]. For\ninstance, in Figs. 2A\u20132D there could in principle be some subsequent evolution in the dipole 02 leading to\ncreation of many dipoles which would interact with the target. The evolution may also lead to creation of\ndipoles at late times (\u03c4 > 0). However all these emissions and interactions would not modify the momentum\nof the gluon that we measure, since they happen in a different dipole isolated from ours in the large-Nc\nlimit. Therefore one can show that all these interactions would cancel via real\u2013virtual cancellations: first\none can show the cancellation of Coulomb gluon exchanges similarly to some of the cancellations in Sect. II\nand then the cancellation of evolution in dipole 02 follows due to probability conservation (see [8,9]). This\ncan be done for any graph where the evolution branches into two with the emitted gluon being produced by\none of the subsequent evolutions. We therefore conclude that the early evolution is linear. This conclusion\nis similar to what one would obtain applying AGK cutting rules to the process [33\u201336]. We will return to\nthis similarity in the next Section.\nTo include the preceding evolution into the gluon production cross section of Eq.

The\nquantity n(r, x01 , b, y) was defined in [8] and was shown to satisfy the linear evolution equation equivalent\nto BFKL.

(19) runs along a straight line parallel to imaginary axis to the right of all the singularities\nof the integrand. In Eq. (18) Y is the total rapidity interval of the DIS process while the measured emitted\ngluon is located at rapidity y.\nB. Emission of Softer Gluons\n\nIn the previous Subsection we have understood how to include the evolution of the harder gluons in the\nvirtual photon's wave function. Here we will address the question of how to include the evolution of gluons\n10\n\n\fwith the light cone component of their momenta being softer than the measured one. For instance, in Fig. 2\nafter being emitted the measured gluon splits the dipole 02 into two off-forward dipoles. The dipoles are\noff-forward because the transverse coordinate of the measured gluon is not the same in the amplitude and in\nthe complex conjugate amplitude. Nevertheless there could still be dipole-like evolution in each of these two\ndipoles. More gluons with light cone components of their momenta much smaller than k3+ can be produced\nand these gluons can interact with the target as well.\nWe claim that in order to include the effects of this quantum evolution (in the leading logarithmic approximation) into Eq. (12) one has to substitute\n1 \u2212 e\u2212x\n\n2\n\nQ20s (b)/4\n\n\u2212\u2192 NG (x, b, y)\n\n(22)\n\nfor all the Glauber exponents in it. The quantity NG (x, b, y) is the forward amplitude of a gluon dipole\nscattering on the target. This quantity is similar to N (x, b, y) except the initial state for NG consists of\na pair of gluons in the color singlet state instead of a quark-antiquark pair. The normalization of NG is\nanalogous to Eq. (2). In the large-Nc limit an adjoint (gluon) dipole can be decomposed into two fundamental\n(quark) dipoles. Therefore the scattering amplitude of a single adjoint dipole on a target nucleus in the largeNc approximation is equivalent to the scattering of two fundamental dipoles on the same target. One can\nthus conclude that\nNG (x, b, y) = 2 N (x, b, y) \u2212 N 2 (x, b, y).\n\n(23)\n\nThe evolution equation for NG (x, b, y) can be obtained by inverting Eq. (23) to express N in terms of NG\nq\n2 (x, b, y)\n(24)\nN (x, b, y) = 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 NG\nand by substituting Eq. (24) into Eq. (3).\nOne can see right away that without evolution (y = 0) Eq. (22) turns into equality (see, for instance, [3])\n2\n\nNG (x, b, 0) = 1 \u2212 e\u2212x\n\nQ20s (b)/4\n\n.\n\n(25)\n\nOur goal now is to prove that the substitution of Eq. (22) does correctly incorporate the effects of subsequent\nevolution in the gluon production cross section. As we now know the preceding quantum evolution happens\nonly at \u03c4 < 0 and does not interfere with the subsequent one. Similarly to Sect. II one should consider four\ndifferent cases, corresponding to different emission times of the measured gluon in the amplitude (\u03c41 ) and\nin the complex conjugate amplitude (\u03c42 ). The four cases are: (1) \u03c41 < 0, \u03c42 < 0; (2) \u03c41 < 0, \u03c42 > 0; (3) \u03c41 >\n0, \u03c42 < 0; (4) \u03c41 > 0, \u03c42 > 0.\nLet us first consider case (1). In the quasi-classical case of Eq. (7) it gave us the exponent in\nEq. (8). According to Eq.\u0001 (22) we now have to prove that evolution replaces that exponent with\n1 \u2212 NG z 1 \u2212 z 2 , 21 (z 1 + z 2 ), y . That means that the gluons in the subsequent evolution connect only to the\nemitted gluon line mimicking the scattering amplitude of a gluon dipole of size z 1 \u2212 z 2 on a nucleus.\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nF\n\nG\n\nH\n\n0\n3\n\n3'\n\n2\n1\n0\n\n0\n\nE\n\nFIG. 5. Diagrams including one softer gluon produced after the emission of the measured gluon.\n\n11\n\n\fTo prove that the gluons in the subsequent evolution connect only to the gluon line of the measured gluon\nlet us again consider a simple case when we add one more gluon emission to the quasi-classical diagrams of\nFig. 1. Different from the previous Subsection the extra gluon's light cone momentum should be much softer\nthat the measured gluon's one. To prove the cancellation of all the diagrams where the extra soft gluon\ninteracts with the quark lines it is sufficient to consider graphs presented in Fig. 5. There after emitting the\nmeasured gluon #3 we include and extra emission of a softer gluon #2 (k2+ \u226a k3+ ). All the other relevant\ndiagrams could be obtained by vertical and horizontal reflections of the graphs in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5 we kept\nonly the diagrams where the emission of gluon #2 is enhanced by a logarithm of energy leaving out all the\nsubleading ones similar to how it was done in obtaining Fig. 4. The diagrams where the soft gluon (#2)\nis both emitted and absorbed by quark lines are easily canceled by real-virtual cancellations [8,9,24] and\nneed not be considered in much detail. In the diagrams A and F in Fig. 5 we imply summation over both\npossible time orderings of gluon #2. As in Fig. 2 the interaction with the target is not shown explicitly and\nis denoted by dashed vertical lines.\nLet us consider diagrams A and D in Fig. 5. Emissions of gluons #2 and #3 bring in the same transverse\ncoordinate dependence in all graphs in Fig. 5. The only possible difference between A and D could be in\nthe interactions with the target. In diagram A the Coulomb gluons could be exchanged only between gluon\n#3 and the target, while it appears that in diagram D the target could interact with gluon #2 as well.\n(Interactions of the target with the quark and antiquark lines cancel via real-virtual cancellations similar\nto Fig. 2A.) However, since the transverse momentum of gluon #2 is being integrated over the transverse\ncoordinates of that gluon are equal on both sides of the cut. That way the Coulomb exchanges between the\ntarget and this gluon also cancel through real-virtual cancellations. Therefore both graphs A and D include\nthe same interactions with the target giving identical absolute contributions to the cross section. The only\ndifference is that in graph D the gluon #2 is a real gluon while in graph A the gluon #2 is purely virtual\nand is emitted and absorbed at \u03c4 < 0. Thus the contribution of the diagram in Fig. 5A comes with the\nnegative sign with respect to the diagram in Fig. 5D. Therefore they cancel each other:\nA + D = 0.\n\n(26)\n\nIn considering diagrams B and C in Fig. 5 we note that the interactions with the target are manifestly the\nsame in both of them. The only difference between graphs B and C is that the gluon has been moved across\nthe cut in C. Using the cancellation of final state interaction rules outlined in [9] we argue that these two\ndiagrams cancel each other\nB + C = 0.\n\n(27)\n\nF + G = 0.\n\n(28)\n\nSimilarly one can show that\n\nFinally a simple analysis can show that in graphs E and H in Fig. 5 the interactions with the target involve\nonly gluons and are identical. In both cases the interactions are equivalent to scattering of a dipole 32 and a\ndipole 3\u2032 2 on the target. Thus the diagrams E and H give the same absolute contributions. However, their\nsigns are different since E is virtual while H is real. Therefore they also cancel\nE + H = 0.\n\n(29)\n\nWe have proved that only interactions with the gluon #3 survive in the symmetric case (1). The result could\nbe easily generalized to any number of softer gluons.\nLastly we have to show that the softer gluons that connect to 3 and 3\u2032 add up to give a scattering\namplitude of a gluon dipole 33\u2032 on the target nucleus NG (3 \u2212 3\u2032 ). To prove this one has to carefully analyze\nthe diagrams with one extra gluon, similar to Fig. 5 only with the gluon #2 connecting only to gluon #3\n(#3\u2032 ) and then generalize the result to any number of soft gluons. This is what has been checked by the\nauthors. Alternatively we can use the duality property of the amplitude which was used in [40]. We may just\nargue that the amplitude would remain the same if we mirror-reflect the gluon #3\u2032 in the complex conjugate\namplitude into the amplitude. Then the gluon production graph would become manifestly equivalent to the\nscattering of a 33\u2032 dipole on the nucleus justifying the substitution of Eq. (22) in case (1) as desired.\n\n12\n\n\fThe proofs of substitution of Eq. (22) for cases (2),(3) and (4) is analogous to the one outlined above. In\ncases (2) and (3) one first has to show that emission of a softer gluon is only possible off the gluon and the\nquark involved in the appropriate exponents in Eq. (10). That means all interactions with one of the quarks\nshould cancel. Which one of the quarks becomes the \"spectator\" depends on the way the gluon #3 was\nemitted in the amplitude and in the complex conjugate amplitude, similar to Sect. II. After that by moving\n(reflecting) the remaining (interacting) quark across the cut one can show that, since in the large-Nc limit\ntwo quarks with the same coordinates are identical to a gluon, the interaction is identical to a scattering of\nan adjoint dipole on the target. The adjoint dipole would be composed of the gluon #3 and the interacting\nquark, thus justifying the substitution of Eq. (22). In case (4) we explicitly have two fundamental dipoles\n01 on both sides of the cut developing the evolution and interacting with the target. Using Eq. (23) we can\nonce again prove the substitution of Eq. (22).\nC. Expression for the Inclusive Cross Section\n\nNow that we have understood above the effects of evolution on the quasi-classical expression for the\ninclusive gluon production cross section we can combine the results to write down the answer including all\nevolution effects. The evolution preceding the emission of measured gluon can be included by the substitution\nshown in Eq. (18). The evolution is linear, similar to what one would obtain from AGK cutting rules [33\u201336].\nThis is not the first time AGK cutting rules are shown to work for an observable in dipole evolution. They\nwere also satisfied by the equation for the diffractive structure function found in [24].\nThe evolution following the emission of the measured gluon is nonlinear and can be included by making the\nsubstitution of Eq. (22). It is quite surprising that such a complicated evolution effect can be incorporated\nby such a rather compact rule.\nCombining Eqs. (7) and (12) with the prescriptions of Eqs. (18) and (22) we obtain\nZ\n\u2217\n\u2217\nd2 x01 \u03b1s CF 1\nd\u03c3 \u03b3 A\u2192qq\u0304GX\n1\nd2 b\n=\nd2 r d\u03b1 \u03a6\u03b3 \u2192qq\u0304 (r, \u03b1) d2 B n(r, x01 , B \u2212 b, Y \u2212 y)\n2\n2\nd k dy\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0x201 \u03c0 2 (2\u03c0)2\n\u00d7 d2 z1 d2 z2 e\u2212ik*(z1 \u2212z2 )\n\n1\nX\n\ni,j=0\n\n(\u22121)i+j\n\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u0013\nz 2 \u2212 xj\nz 1 \u2212 xi\n1\nz\nN\n*\n(z\n\u2212\nx\n,\n+\nx\n),\ny\n+\nG\n1\nj\nj\n|z 1 \u2212 xi |2 |z 2 \u2212 xj |2\n2 1\n\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0015\n1\n1\n1\n+ NG z 2 \u2212 xi , (z 2 + xi ), y \u2212 NG z 1 \u2212 z 2 , (z 1 + z 2 ), y \u2212 NG xi \u2212 xj , (xi + xj ), y ,\n2\n2\n2\n\n(30)\n\nwhere the produced measured gluon has rapidity y, the total rapidity interval in Y and\nb =\n\n1\n(x + x1 ).\n2 0\n\n(31)\n\nEq. (30) gives us the single inclusive gluon production cross section in DIS on a hadron or nucleus including\nthe effects of nonlinear leading logarithmic evolution and multiple rescatterings. This is the main result of\nthe paper.\nIV. FACTORIZED FORM OF THE INCLUSIVE CROSS SECTION\n\nWe now continue by analyzing Eq. (30) in the limit of a very large target nucleus. In that case the\nmomentum transfer to the nucleus is cut off by inverse nuclear radius and is very small. We can therefore\ntake the scattering amplitudes NG in Eq. (30) at t = 0, which in coordinate space is equivalent to neglecting\nthe small compared to the nuclear radius shifts in impact parameter dependence. Similar to how it was done\nin [7,12] we assume that\nNG (x, b \u00b1 y/2, Y ) \u2248 NG (x, b, Y ),\n13\n\n(32)\n\n\fwhere y represents any of the impact parameter shifts in Eq. (30). Integrating over z 1 or z 2 depending on\nthe argument of NG in the term involved we reduce Eq.

(39) presents our cross section in some sort of kT \u2013factorized form, similar to the inclusive cross sections\nderived in [33]. It is almost identical with Eq. (14) in [34], which was obtained by applying AGK rules to\nBFKL pomeron fan diagrams in DIS case. The only difference between our Eq. (39) and Eq. (14) in [34] is\nthat the latter uses N (z, b, y) (the function \u03a6(y, r, b) in the notation of [34]) instead of our NG (z, b, y). That\nis in order to obtain Eq. (14) of [34] from our Eq. (39) one has to substitute NG with N in it. In the weak\nfield limit when the evolution is linear both N and NG obey the same BFKL evolution equation, though\nwith different initial conditions given by Eqs. (4) and (25) correspondingly. In the saturation region the\nevolutions equations for the two quantities in question become different. N (z, b, y) obeys Eq. (3), while the\nequation for NG (z, b, y) can be obtained by substituting Eq. (24) into Eq. (3). The resulting equation would\ninvolve square roots and would be quite different from Eq. (3). However the high energy asymptotics of\nthe two objects is still the same: both N (z, b, y) and NG (z, b, y) asymptotically approach 1 at high energies,\nwhen y \u2192 \u221e.\nThe form of the cross section in Eq. (39) suggests that in a certain gauge or in some gauge invariant way\nit could be written in a factorized form involving two unintegrated gluon distributions merged by effective\nLipatov vertex.

Expanding both Eq. (47) and Eq. (48) to the lowest\norder in Q20s corresponding to two gluon exchange we can see that Eq. (46) can be easily satisfied. However\nfull Eqs. (47) and (48) when inserted into Eq. (46) do not satisfy it. Therefore Eq. (46) seems to work for the\nleading twist two gluon exchange approximation but appears to fail once we include multiple rescatterings\nin it.\nThe failure of Eq. (46) in the quasi\u2013classical limit makes the physical meaning of factorization of Eq. (44)\nquite obscure. The factorized form of Eq. (44) implies convolution of two unintegrated gluon distributions\nwith Lipatov vertex as shown in Eq. (40). It appears, however, that we can not identify one of the convoluted\nfunctions (NG ) with the unintegrated gluon distribution in disagreement with the factorization hypothesis\nof Eq. (40). This observation by itself would be quite natural indicating that higher twists in the form of\nmultiple rescatterings modify the relationship between NG and the unintegrated gluon distribution. On the\nother hand the fact that kT \u2013factorization is still preserved seems somewhat unexpected. The reason why we\nare able to write down the inclusive cross section of Eq. (30) in the factorized form of Eq. (39) needs to be\nbetter clarified which will be done elsewhere.\nV. PROPERTIES OF THE INCLUSIVE CROSS SECTION\n\nIt was shown in [12] that asymptotic solutions to the nonlinear evolution equation bear most of quantitative\nfeatures of the general one and are very convenient for discussion of various high energy processes. To study\nasymptotic behavior of the inclusive gluon production it is convenient to integrate over directions of vector\nz in Eq. (34) and use Fourier transform of the gluon scattering amplitude \u00d1G (l, y) defined as\nZ \u221e\ndl l J0 (lz)\u00d1G (l, y)\n(49)\nNG (z, y) = z 2\n0\n\nwith l = |l|, obtaining\n\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\u2217\n1\nd\u03c3 \u03b3 A\u2192qq\u0304GX\nd\u03bb \u1fb1s \u03c7(\u03bb)(Y \u2212y) \u03b1s CF \u221e dz \u0010 r \u00112\u03bb\n2\n\u03b3 \u2217 \u2192qq\u0304\n=\ne\nd\nr\nd\u03b1\n\u03a6\n(r,\n\u03b1)\nd2 k dy\n2\u03c0 2\n2\u03c0i\n\u03c02\nz z\n0\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\nz2 \u221e\nk2 z 2\n2kz\n\u00d7 2\nJ0 (kz) + 2J0 (kz) .\nJ1 (kz) \u2212\ndl l J0 (lz) \u00d1G (l, y)\nk 0\n\u03bb\n2\u03bb2\n\n(50)\n\ny\n\n2\n\nQs ( y )\n\n4\n1\n\n3\n\u039b\n\nQ\n\nk\n\nFIG. 6. Various asymptotic kinematical regions discussed in the text. Solid line is the saturation scale Qs (y). Bold\nlines are the boundaries of different regions.\n\n16\n\n\fThere are four interesting asymptotic regions of Eq. (50). They are shown in Fig. 6. In the first and\nsecond regions the produced gluon momentum k is the largest external momentum scale of the process. The\nfirst region in Fig. 6 corresponds to the cases when k \u226b Qs (y) \u226b Q and k \u226b Q \u226b Qs (y), while in the\nsecond region Qs (y) \u226b k \u226b Q and Qs (y) \u226b Q \u226b k. We can find asymptotic behavior of the inclusive cross\nsection by expanding function \u03c7(\u03bb) near its simple pole at \u03bb = 0 and evaluating the Mellin transform in \u03bb in\nthe saddle point approximation. This corresponds to the double logarithmic approximation to the evolution\nequation which means summation of \u03b1n lnn k (Y \u2212 y)n \u223c 1 terms. The third and fourth regions in Fig. 6\ndepict the cases when Q \u226b k \u226b Qs (y) and Q \u226b Qs (y) \u226b k correspondingly. In the third and fourth regions\nasymptotic behavior of the inclusive cross section can be found by repeating this procedure near the simple\npole of \u03c7(\u03bb) at \u03bb = 1 which again corresponds to summation of \u03b1n lnn k (Y \u2212 y)n \u223c 1 terms. These are two\nasymptotic double logarithmic regions relevant to the linear evolution before the gluon has been emitted.\nGenerally, after its emission the evolution is nonlinear. So, there is a kinematical domain where the parton\ndensity is large (regions 2 and 4 in Fig. 6). In this domain a color dipole evolves into two dipoles, one of\nwhich is of the size 1/Qs (y). And there is a kinematical domain where the parton density is small (regions\n1 and 3) and the evolution is still linear.\nIntegration over z in Eq.

One factor of k \u22122 arises from the Lipatov's effective vertex, while another one is\ngiven by the perturbative behavior of the scattering amplitude \u22072 NG which scales as \u223c k \u22122 at large k\u22a5 .\nWhen the typical momentum l of the late evolution is less than the saturation scale Qs (y), the anomalous\ndimension of the gluon structure function is close to unity. Thus the scattering amplitude depends only\nlogarithmically on momentum. As a result, in the region 2 the gluon spectrum softens to k \u22122 behavior.\nIn the region 3 the late evolution is linear like in region 1. However an additional factor of k 2 stems from\ndifferent double logarithmic asymptotics at \u03bb = 1. It is remarkable that unlike the regions 1 and 2, the\nspectrum in region 4 drops in the same manner as in the region 3 despite the fact that the late evolution is\nnonlinear. This happens because the typical value of l in the rightmost integral in Eq. (52) is l \u223c Qs . Due\nto this fact Eq. (59) is enhanced by a factor of Q2s rather than k 2 . Of course, one could not expect that\nthe spectrum will depend on produced gluon's momentum only logarithmically in the presence of a hard\nprojectile (virtual photon) which wave function has not reached saturation yet.\nDerived asymptotic formulae Eq. (55), Eq. (57), Eq. (58) and Eq. (59) make it possible to understand\nsome important features of the spectrum energy dependence. Equating the y derivative of the expression\nin the exponent of Eq. (55) (or Eq. (58)) to zero one finds the position of the inclusive spectrum maximum\ny0 at some fixed k in the double logarithmic approximation in which the pre-exponential factor is a slowly\nvarying function. It reads\ny0 = Y\n\n1\n1\u00b1\n\nk\u226bQ,Q0s\n\nln2 (kr)\nln2 (k/Q0s )\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\n1\nY,\n2\n\n(60)\n\nwhere + and \u2212 correspond to the regions 1 and 3. By analogy we find that in the region 2 spectrum is\na monotonically decreasing function of y and exhibits no maximum. In the region 4 the spectrum has no\n18\n\n\fmaximum in y as well. The following equation defines a surface in the space of parameters where spectrum\nis constant:\n\u00132\n\u0012\n1\n1\n= 16\u1fb1s Y ln 2\n.\n(61)\n4\u1fb1s Y + ln2 2\nQs (0)r2\nQs (0)r2\nAlthough Eq. (61) is beyond the validity of the double logarithmic approximation employed in this section,\nit shows the general feature of the spectrum y-dependence in region 4. Namely, when Q \u223c Qs the spectrum\nis a step-like function. In Fig. 7 we show a qualitative picture of the energy behavior of the inclusive cross\nsection given by Eq.

By plotting the experimental data on the energy dependence of the spectrum one can\ndistinguish between different kinematical regions which may be useful for evaluation of the saturation scale.\nHowever, we realize that our calculations in the asymptotic regions presented in this Section are approximate\nand an exact numerical analysis of the cross section in Eq. (39) has to be performed to enable us to describe\nthe data with it.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have constructed an expression for single inclusive gluon production cross section in DIS (Eq. (30))\nincluding multiple pomeron exchanges in the form of nonlinear evolution (Eq. (3)). The cross section may be\nused to describe (mini)jet production in DIS. For the case of a large target nucleus the resulting production\ncross section can be written in kT \u2013factorized form of Eq. (39). The transverse momentum spectrum given\nby the cross section of Eq. (30) reproduces the usual perturbative behavior \u223c 1/k4 in the large k\u22a5 limit (see\n19\n\n\fEqs. (55) and (57)). In the small transverse momentum region the spectrum softens to \u223c 1/k2 (see Eqs.\n(58) and (59)). The cross section still exhibits some residual infrared divergence. This is due to the fact\nthat we are scattering a point-like probe (virtual photon) on the target. The target nucleus' wave function\nhas reached saturation and this is why the k\u22a5 dependence softens in the infrared. However, for the cross\nsection to be infrared safe (up to logarithms), similar to [31], we need the wave functions of both colliding\nparticles to reach saturation. In [31] that was reached for the case of nucleus-nucleus scattering where both\nnuclear wave functions were in the saturation region. In our case the wave function of the quark-antiquark\npair has not reached saturation yet. The onset of saturation in the \u03b3 \u2217 wave function would again be due to\nmultiple pomeron exchanges. Unlike the case of a nucleus with nucleons there is no extra non-perturbative\ncolor charges in the original incoming \u03b3 \u2217 wave function to facilitate saturation. All the color charges have\nto be generated perturbatively. Therefore the multiple pomeron exchanges in the \u03b3 \u2217 wave function would\ntake the form of pomeron loops [8,39]. Summation of pomeron loops is a separate problem and is beyond\nthe scope of this paper. The effects of pomeron loops can be safely neglected in the energy range considered\nhere.\nThe result of Eq. (30) could be generalized to the case of proton-nucleus scattering (pA). If one models\nproton as a dipole made out of diquark and a quark the inclusive gluon production cross section can be\nobtained by appropriately modifying the linear evolution term (Eq. (18)) and changing the \u03b3 \u2217 wave function\ninto the proton's wave function. In a more generic case of a proton consisting of Nc valence quarks the\ngeneralization is probably a bit more involved, though the preceding evolution still remains linear and the\ngluon production mechanism would not be modified.\nWe have shown that the evolution in the nuclear wave function (at least in the large-Nc limit) can be\nincluded via a simple substitution of the Glauber-Mueller amplitude by the dipole-evolved amplitude as\npresented in Eq. (22). We may therefore try to apply this principle to nucleus-nucleus collisions (AA). In\n[31] it was argued that the multiplicity of produced gluons in a central nuclear collision is likely to be given\nby the following formula:\n\u001a Z\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011\nAA\n2\n2\n2\n2\ndNcl\nd2 z ik*z 1 \u0010\n2 CF\n\u2212\ne\n=\n1 \u2212 e\u2212z Q0s1 (b)/4\n1 \u2212 e\u2212z Q0s2 (b)/4 +\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nd k d b dy\n\u03b1s \u03c0\n(2\u03c0)\nz\n+\n\nZ\n\nd2 x d2 y ik*(x\u2212y) x y\ne\n*\n(2\u03c0)3\nx2 y2\n\n\"\n\nx2\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011\n2\n2\n2\n2\n1\n1 \u2212 e\u2212x Q0s1 (b)/4\n1 \u2212 e\u2212x Q0s2 (b)/4 +\n1\nln |x|\u03bc\n\n\uf8f9\uf8fc\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011 \uf8fd\n2\n2\n2\n2\n1\n1 \u2212 e\u2212y Q0s1 (b)/4\n1 \u2212 e\u2212y Q0s2 (b)/4 \uf8fb .\n+ 2\n1\n\uf8fe\ny ln |y|\u03bc\n\n(62)\n\nQ20s1 (b) and Q20s2 (b) are the saturation scales in each of nuclei taken at the same impact parameter since\nthe collisions considered are central. Inspired by the success of the substitution (22) in incorporating the\nquantum evolution corrections in DIS we may conjecture the following ansatz for the multiplicity distribution\nof the produced gluons in AA including nonlinear evolution in the wave functions of both nuclei\n\u001a Z\nd2 z ik*z 1\n2 CF\ndN AA\n\u2212\ne\n=\nNG1 (z, b, y) NG2 (z, b, Y \u2212 y)+\n2\n2\n2\nd k d b dy\n\u03b1s \u03c0\n(2\u03c0)2\nz2\n+\n\nZ\n\nd2 x d2 y ik*(x\u2212y) x y\ne\n*\n(2\u03c0)3\nx2 y 2\n\n\"\n\nx2\n\n1\n1 NG1 (x, b, y) NG2 (x, b, Y \u2212 y)+\nln |x|\u03bc\n\n\uf8f9\uf8fc\n\uf8fd\n1\n\uf8fb ,\nb,\ny)\nN\n(y,\nb,\nY\n\u2212\ny)\n+ 2\nN\n(y,\nG2\nG1\n1\n\uf8fe\ny ln |y|\u03bc\n\n(63)\n\nwhere Y is the total rapidity interval and NG1 and NG2 are adjoint dipole forward scattering amplitudes\nin the first and second nucleus correspondingly. At the moment we can not prove Eq. (63) and leave it as\n20\n\n\fan ansatz inspired by the properties of the inclusive cross sections in the saturation region studied above.\nWe may argue that the final state gluon mergers which are not included in Eq. (62) are not likely to\ngive logarithms of energy and therefore should not contribute to the quantum evolution. They might be\nneglected compared to the evolution effects included in Eq. (63). Eq. (63), together with Eq. (3), may be\nused to describe the emerging RHIC data similar to how it was done in [41].\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors would like to thank Mikhail Braun, Genya Levin, and Al Mueller for stimulating and informative discussions.\nThe work of Yu.
