The story so far\n\nIn a previous paper [1], hereafter cited as I, we studied the tunneling of a spin governed\nby the Hamiltonian\nH = \u2212k2 Jz2 + (k1 \u2212 k2 )Jx2 \u2212 g\u03bcB J * H,\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere J is a dimensionless spin operator, and k1 > k2 > 0. This Hamiltonian is the simplest\ndescriptor of the magnetic properties of the molecule [(tacn)6 Fe8 O2 (OH)12 ]8+ (or just Fe8\nfor short), with J = 10, k1 \u2248 0.33 K, and k2 \u2248 0.22 K [2\u20134]. Interest in this molecule arises\nbecause of its rich low temperature magnetic behavior, which include hysteresis at the level\nof one molecule [2], and more recently, the discovery [5] of an entire lattice of diabolical\npoints [6,7] in its magnetic spectrum, a subset of which was predicted to exist earlier [8]. It\nis the latter property that we wish to continue investigating in this paper.\nIn paper I, attention was confined to the case where the external magnetic field H is along\nthe hard axis x. In this case, the classical energy, which may be viewed as the expectation\nvalue hHi of the Hamiltonian in a spin-coherent state, is symmetric about the xy plane,\nand the problem is analogous to that of a massive particle in one dimension in a reflection\nsymmetric double well potential. It is then natural to consider the tunneling between the\nsymmetrically related states localized in the left- and right-hand wells. In the magnetic case,\nthe analogous states are those with predominatly positive and negative values of Jz , at least\nas long as Hx is not so large as to bring the classical minima very close to the x axis. The\nsurprise is that the tunnel splitting between the ground states oscillates as a function of Hx ,\nvanishing exactly at a series of points. In fact, the splitting between higher pairs of levels\nalso vanishes at just these points, as noted in I and earlier studies [9,10].\nIn addition to observing the quenching of ground state tunneling when Hkx, however,\nWernsdorfer and Sessoli [5] also performed experiments with Hz 6= 0. The reflection symmetry of the classical energy is now lost, but if the value of Hz is chosen properly, it is\npossible to bring an excited state in the positive Jz well into approximate degeneracy with\nthe ground state of the negative Jz well. The new discovery by them is that if Hx is now\nvaried, the tunnel splitting between the degenerate or quasi-degenerate levels again oscillates. It is theoretically understood that if both Hz and Hx are properly tuned, the splitting\nvanishes exactly in this case too [9,11]. Experimentally, of course, one can never see a perfect\nzero in the splitting, and Wernsdorfer and Sessoli only see a minimum in the Landau-ZenerSt\u00fcckelberg transition rate between the levels in question. The minima are so deep, however,\nthat there is little doubt that the underlying tunneling matrix element is quenched.\nWhen Hkx, the Hamiltonian (1.1) is invariant under a 180\u25e6 rotation about x, and the\nquenchings can be understood from the viewpoint of the von Neumann-Wigner theorem\nas allowed crossings of energy levels with different parities under this rotation. A similar\nargument can be made when Hkz. When H has both x and z components, however, the\nHamiltonian has no obvious symmetry, and the above theorem states that an intersection\nof two energy levels is infinitely unlikely as a single parameter in the Hamiltonian is varied.\nFor a real symmetric Hamiltonian, it is known [12] that one must vary two parameters to\nobtain an intersection. Since we can choose the matrices of both Jz and Jx to be real in the\n2\n\n\fJz basis, these two parameters can be taken as Hx and Hz . The isolated points [13] in the\nHx -Hz plane where any two levels intersect are precisely what Herzberg and Longuet-Higgins\n[6] call conical intersections and what Berry and Wilkinson [7] call diabolical points. The\nlatter terminology originates in the resemblance of the energy surface-a double cone with\na common vertex [14]-to an Italian toy called the diavolo.\nB. Content and plan of this paper; the perfect lattice hypothesis\n\nIn this paper we shall allow H to lie in the x \u2212 z plane, with a view to studying the\ntunneling in the asymmetrical well, and locating the diabolical points. As in paper I, our\nanalysis is based on the discrete phase integral (DPI), or Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method\n[15]. This method is semiclassical in character, with 1/J playing the same role as h\u0304 in the\ncontinuum phase integral method. To introduce this method, let us write the Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation H|\u03c8i = E|\u03c8i in the Jz eigenbasis {|mi}. With Jz |mi = m|mi, hm|\u03c8i = Cm ,\nhm|H|mi = wm , and hm|H|m\u2032 i = tm,m\u2032 (m 6= m\u2032 ), we have\nm+2\nX\u2032\n\ntm,n Cn + wm Cm = ECm ,\n\n(1.2)\n\nn=m\u22122\n\nwhere the prime on the sum indicates omission of the n = m term. A vivid picture of the\napproximation can be obtained if we think of Eq. (1.2) as the tight-binding model for an\nelectron in a one-dimensional lattice with sites labelled by m, and on-site (wm ) and hopping\n(tm,m\u00b11 , tm,m\u00b12 ) energies. If J \u226b 1, these matrix elements vary slowly with m, on a length\nscale of order J in fact. We may then use the approximation of semiclassical dynamics\nby working entirely in terms of wavepackets whose spatial extent is much less than the\nlength scale over which the properties of the lattice vary, i.e., J, and whose spread in Bloch\nvectors is much less than the width of the Brillouin zone, i.e., 2\u03c0. These ideas have close\ncounterparts in the continuum quasiclassical method, and the DPI method is nothing but\nthe discrete analog.\nWhen Hkx, the problem can also be approached using instantons-indeed the oscillations\nin the splitting were discovered in this way. When H has other components besides Hx ,\nhowever, the DPI method is, to our knowledge, the only successful one to date. Villain and\nFort's approach [9] is also an approximate version of this method that makes artful use of\nsome special features of the Fe8 problem and works for small values of the field. Our analysis\nis more prosaic, and almost self-evident once one has understood how to deal with the new\nfeature in Eq. (1.2)-the presence of second neighbour hopping. This gives rise to novel\nturning points with no continuum analogues. Connection formulas for these turning points\nare given in Ref. [16]. We have quoted the results of our analysis before [11,10](b), but the\ndetails are only being presented here.\nOur main result for the specific Hamiltonian (1.1) is for the locations of the diabolical\npoints. We find that the l\u2032 th level in the negative Jz well (where l\u2032 = 0 denotes the lowest\nlevel) and the l\u2032\u2032 th level in the positive Jz well are degenerate when (see Fig. 1)\n\u221a \u2032\u2032\nHz (l\u2032 , l\u2032\u2032 )\n\u03bb(l \u2212 l\u2032 )\n=\n(1.3)\nHc\n2J\n3\n\n\fHx (l\u2032 , l\u2032\u2032 )\n=\nHc\n\n\u221a\n\ni\n1\u2212\u03bbh\nJ \u2212 n \u2212 12 (l\u2032 + l\u2032\u2032 + 1) ,\nJ\n\n(1.4)\n\nwith n = 0, 1, . . . , 2J \u2212 (l\u2032 + l\u2032\u2032 + 1). Here, \u03bb = k2 /k1 , and Hc = 2k1 J/g\u03bcB .\nIt should be stressed that Eqs. (1.3) and (1.4) only represent the first terms of a series in\n1/J, and that our DPI calculations give no reason to believe that the higher order terms are\nabsent. Yet a large amount of empirical evidence suggests just this, i.e., that the formulas\nare exact as written! That the diabolical points lie on a perfect centered rectangular lattice,\nand that many pairs of levels are simultaneously degenerate, we refer to as the perfect lattice\nhypothesis. It has previously been made for the ground state on the Hz = 0 line by Villain\nand Fort [9], and extended to include simultaneous degeneracy of the higher states by us\n[10](b). This was shown by perturbation theory in \u03bb to O(\u03bb3) for all J, and analytically for\nJ \u2264 2. We have\u221asince found\nanalytically that for J = 3/2, the additional diabolical point\n\u221a\nat (Hx , Hz ) = ( 1 \u2212 \u03bb, \u03bb)Hc /3 is exact. Of course, Kramers theorem guarantees double\ndegeneracy of all energy eigenvalues at the point Hx = Hz = 0 for all half-integral J. We\nhave also checked this hypothesis numerically for a variety of values of \u03bb, and J up to 10.\nWe present our results for J = 5 in Table I. The deviations in the locations of the diabolical\npoints from the perfect lattice hypothesis predictions are never more than 10\u221210 , certainly\nmuch less than order 1/J. In fact, the values listed are below the numerical tolerance that\nwe prescribed.\nFurther support for the perfect lattice hypothesis comes from the fact that it is consistent\nwith the following duality property of the Hamiltonian (1.1). If we set k1 = 1, H may be\nwritten as H(\u03bb, Hx , Hz ), showing its dependence\non the three parameters, \u03bb, Hx and Hz .\n\u221a\nBy a 90\u25e6 rotation about the axis (x\u0302 + \u1e91)/ 2, we obtain the transformation\nH(\u03bb, Hx , Hz ) \u2194 \u2212H(1 \u2212 \u03bb, Hz , Hx ).\n\n(1.5)\n\nIn particular, the spectra of the two Hamiltonians are so related, and ranking the levels is\norder of increasing energy, we see that if the levels with ordinal numbers k and k + 1 are\ndegenerate when Hx = fx (\u03bb) and Hy = fy (\u03bb), then level numbers 2J + 2 \u2212 k and 2J + 1 \u2212 k\nare degenerate when Hx = fy (1 \u2212 \u03bb) and Hy = fx (1 \u2212 \u03bb). These conditions do not constrain\nthe functions fx and fy in any real way, however, so the discovery of formulas (1.3) and (1.4)\nmust presently be put down to serendipity.\nThe plan of our paper is as follows. In Sec. II, we analyze the asymmetric double well\nproblem in completely general terms. We briefly review the DPI method and the asymmetric\ndouble-well problem in one dimensional quantum mechanics. In contrast to the situation\nthat prevails in that case, we must deal with four independent DPI wavefunctions at every\npoint. Consequently the matching problem is harder and more subtle. Its study forms the\nbulk (subsections C to G) of the analysis. The main result of this analysis is a formula for\nthe diabolo [Eq. (2.63)], and a two level system Hamiltonian [Eq. (2.64)]. The tunneling\namplitude appearing in these formulas is found in a general form [Eq. (2.60)] involving a\nsmall number of action integrals running between various turning points. Readers who are\nnot interested in the details of the analysis should skip to subsection H and read on from\nEq. (2.63). They may also find the last paragraph of Sec. II interesting.\nIn Sec. III, we apply the general analysis to the model (1.1) for Fe8 . To keep the analysis\ntractable, we will assume that Hz /Hc is small, although there is no reason why one could\n4\n\n\fnot apply the results of Sec. II numerically for arbitrary values of Hz . It may in fact\nbe interesting to do this to further investigate the perfect lattice hypothesis. Further, as\ndiscussed in Sec. III, the duality property of H immediately extends our work to large Hz\nand small Hx .\nII. GENERAL FORMULA FOR DIABOLO IN TERMS OF ACTION INTEGRALS\nA. Summary of DPI method, critical curves, etc.\n\nVery briefly, the DPI analysis proceeds as follows. (See Ref. [16] and paper I for details.)\nLet the energy of an electron wavepacket in the equivalent tight-binding model be given\nby Hsc (q, m) where q and m are the mean wavevector and position of the wavepacket,\nrespectively. Holding m fixed, we may think of Hsc (q, m) as a dispersion relation for the local\nenergy band. The mean velocity of the wavepacket is then given by v(q, m) = \u2202Hsc (q, m)/\u2202q.\nIf we regard m as a continuous variable, and approximate wm , tm,m\u00b11 , and tm,m\u00b12 by smooth\nfunctions w(m), t1 (m), and t2 (m), then\nHsc (q, m) = w(m) + 2t1 (m) cos q + 2t2 (m) cos(2q),\nv(q, m) = \u22122 sin q(m)(t1 (m) + 4t2 (m) cos q(m)).\n\n(2.1)\n(2.2)\n\nIn close analogy with the continuum method, one can show that the quasiclassical solution\nto the wavefunction for a given energy E is given by linear combinations of solutions of the\nform\n1\nCm \u223c q\nexp i\nv(m)\n\n\u0012 Z\n\nm\n\n\u0013\n\nq(m\u2032 )dm\u2032 ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere q(m) and v(m) are given by\n\nE = Hsc (q(m), m),\n\nv(m) = v(q(m), m).\n\n(2.4)\n\nIt follows from Eq. (2.3) that the quasiclassical solution breaks down when v(m) = 0-\nwhich we call a turning point, as in the continuum case. At these points, the solutions must\nbe augmented by connection formulas. In addition to the values q = 0 and q = \u03c0, v(m) also\nvanishes at q = q \u2217 (m) = cos\u22121 (\u2212t1 (m)/4t2 (m)). We will get turning points whenever E\nequals U0 (m), U\u03c0 (m), or U\u2217 (m), where these three functions are Hsc (0, m), Hsc (\u03c0, m), and\nHsc (q \u2217 , m) respectively. These three curves, which we call critical curves, collectively play\nthe same role as the potential energy in the continuum case.\n \u0304 energies in units of k1 J \u03042 ,\nFor Fe8 , in the same reduced variables as in I [\u03bc = m/J,\n1\nJ \u0304 = (J + 2 )], the on-site and hopping energies are given by\nw(m) = 21 (1 + \u03bb)(1 \u2212 \u03bc2 ) \u2212 2hz \u03bc,\n2 1/2\n\nt1 (m) = \u2212hx (1 \u2212 \u03bc ) ,\nt2 (m) = 41 (1 \u2212 \u03bb)(1 \u2212 \u03bc2 ).\n\n(2.5)\n(2.6)\n(2.7)\n\n \u0304 c , hz = JHz /JH\n \u0304 c , and Hc = 2k1 J/g\u03bcB . Thus the critical\nHere, \u03bb = k2 /k1 , hx = JHx /JH\ncurves are given by\n5\n\n\fU0 (\u03bc) = 1 \u2212 \u03bc2 \u2212 2hx (1 \u2212 \u03bc2 )1/2 \u2212 2hz \u03bc,\nU\u03c0 (\u03bc) = 1 \u2212 \u03bc2 + 2hx (1 \u2212 \u03bc2 )1/2 \u2212 2hz \u03bc,\nh2x\n\u2212 2hz \u03bc.\nU\u2217 (\u03bc) = \u03bb(1 \u2212 \u03bc2 ) \u2212\n1\u2212\u03bb\n\n(2.8)\n(2.9)\n(2.10)\n\nThese curves are shown in Fig. 2. The energy U\u03c0 (m) is the upper edge of the band Hsc (q, m)\nfor all m. The lower band edge is given by U0 (m) for values of m close to \u00b1J, and by U\u2217 (m)\nfor m in the central region. In the central region, the second neighbour hopping element\nt2 (m) is sufficiently large that the local energy band Hsc (q, m) has its global minimum not\nat q = 0, but at q \u2217 . Since the energy U0 lies in the band, U\u03c0 > U0 > U\u2217 . By contrast, in the\nouter m regions, Hsc (q, m) has only one minimum (at q = 0) and only one maximum (at\nq = \u03c0) for real q. The energy U\u2217 lies outside the band, so that once again U\u03c0 > U0 > U\u2217 .\nThe curves U0 (m) and U\u2217 (m) touch one another with a common tangent at m = \u00b1m\u2217 ,\nwhere\nh2x\nm\u2217 = J \u0304 1 \u2212\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb)2\n\"\n\n#1/2\n\n.\n\n(2.11)\n\nThe turning point where E = U\u2217 is special if it happens at a value of m where U\u2217 lies\nbelow the lower band edge. The wavevector q \u2217 at the turning point is then complex, and\nthe wavefunction Cm changes from a decaying (or growing) exponential on one side to a\ndecaying (or growing) exponential with an oscillatory envelope on the other side. These\nturning points are the new feature caused by second neightbor hopping that we referred to\nin Sec. I.\nB. Nature of asymmetric double well wavefunctions\n\nTo understand how the DPI solutions are to be used to find the eigenstates, it is useful\nto discuss the corresponding problem for an asymmetric double well in the continuum case.\nSuppose the potential is as drawn in Fig. 3. The potential minima are at x0\u00b1 , and for\nthe energy E drawn, the turning points are at x\u2032a and x\u2032b in the left well, and x\u2032\u2032b and x\u2032\u2032a\nin the right well. We use the quasiclassical approximation to find a wavefunction \u03c8 \u2032 (x) on\nthe left hand side as follows. First, we choose the solution which decays exponentially as\nx \u2212 x\u2032a \u2192 \u2212\u221e. This solution is matched via connection formulas at x\u2032a to an oscillatory\nsolution in the region x\u2032a < x < x\u2032b . We then use connection formulas at x\u2032b to find the\nquasiclassical solution in the region x > x\u2032b . We repeat this procedure on the right hand\nside to find a wavefunction \u03c8 \u2032\u2032 (x) that decays to zero as x \u2212 x\u2032\u2032a \u2192 \u221e. The last step is to\ndemand that the wavefunctions \u03c8 \u2032 (x) and \u03c8 \u2032\u2032 (x) be the same in the central region, i.e., in\nthe vicinity of x = 0. This demand will be unsatisfiable for an arbitrarily chosen energy E,\nand will provide one with the eignevalue condition.\nThere are two remarks that we wish make about the above procedure. The first remark\nconcerns the basic nature of the solution. In general, in the central region, the left solution\n\u03c8 \u2032 (x) will be a linear combination of two parts, \u03c8d\u2032 (x) and \u03c8g\u2032 (x), that are exponentially\ndecaying and growing as x \u2212 x\u2032b increases, respectively. Likewise the right solution, \u03c8 \u2032\u2032 , will\nbe a sum of parts that decay (\u03c8d\u2032\u2032 ) and grow (\u03c8g\u2032\u2032 ) as x\u2032\u2032b \u2212 x increases. The key point is that\n6\n\n\fthe growing parts \u03c8g\u2032 and \u03c8g\u2032\u2032 must be present in an eigenstate, for without them, there is no\nway that the values and slopes of \u03c8 \u2032 and \u03c8 \u2032\u2032 could be made to agree at x = 0, say.\nThe second remark is technical. If the potential well is reasonably parabolic near the\nminimum at x0\u2212 , the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be solved directly for any choice of E in\nterms of parabolic cylinder functions, and we can always find a linear combination that will\ndecay to zero as x\u2212x\u2032a \u2192 \u2212\u221e. This linear combination will have both growing and decaying\npieces as x \u2212 x\u2032b grows. In this way we can obtain the wavefucnction \u03c8 \u2032 (x) on the entire\nleft hand side without using connection formulas at x\u2032a or x\u2032b . Once one has found \u03c8 \u2032 (x)\nsufficiently far to the right of x\u2032b in this way, one can write the parabolic cylinder functions\nin quasiclassical form which can then be extended in this form all the way to x = 0. The\nright-hand wavefunction can be treated in the same way. This device leads to considerable\nsavings in labor.\nWe now apply these ideas to our problem. In what follows, we will denote quantities\npertaining to the left hand solution or the left hand side of the well by either a single prime\nor a suffix \u2212, while analogous right-hand quantities will carry a double prime or a + suffix.\nWe consider an energy E as drawn in Fig. 4, which leads to turning points at m\u2032a , m\u2032b , m\u2032c\n\u2032\non the left hand side, and m\u2032\u2032c , m\u2032\u2032b , and m\u2032\u2032a on the right. The wavefunction Cm\nwill decay\n\u2032\naway from the well bottom as m \u2212 ma decreases, oscillate in the classically allowed region\nm\u2032a < m < m\u2032b [17,18]. In the region just to the right of m\u2032b it will consist of a decaying\npart and a growing part. The new feature will be encountered at m\u2032c where E = U\u2217 . For\nm > m\u2032c , both the growing and decaying parts will acquire oscillatory envelopes. Similar\n\u2032\u2032\nremarks apply to the right side wavefunction Cm\n.\nC. DPI wavefunction in the leftmost forbidden region\n\u2032\nWe are now ready to find the wavefunction explicitly. Let us start constructing Cm\nfrom\nthe left. The Hamilton-Jacobi equation in Eq. (2.4) has the general solution\n\n\u2212t1 (m) \u00b1 [t21 (m) \u2212 4t2 (m)f (m)]1/2\n;\n4t2 (m)\nf (m) = w(m) \u2212 2t2 (m) \u2212 E.\n\ncos q(m) =\n\n(2.12)\n(2.13)\n\nThis leads to four values of q(m) for any E, since if q is a solution, so is \u2212q. In the region\nm \u2264 m\u2032a , since E < U0 , all four solutions are pure imaginary. We write the two which lead\nto decaying wavefunctions as \u03bc \u2212 \u03bc\u2032a becomes large and negative as\nq1,2 = \u2212i\u03ba1,2 (\u03bc),\n\n(2.14)\n\nwhere \u03ba2 > \u03ba1 > 0, and the corresponding DPI solutions as\n\u2032\nCm,1\n\u2032\nCm,2\n\n\u2032\n\n= A |v1 (m)|\n\u2032\n\n\u22121/2\n\n= B |v2 (m)|\n\n\u22121/2\n\nm\n\n\u0012 Z\n\nexp i\n\nexp i\n\nZ\n\nm\n\nm\u2032c\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(2.15)\n\nq2 (m\u2032 )dm\u2032 ,\n\n(2.16)\n\nq1 (m )dm\n\n!\n\nwith vi (m) = v(qi (m), m). We take A\u2032 and B \u2032 to be real without any loss of generality. Note\n\u2032\nthat we have left the lower limit of the phase integral for Cm,1\nunspecified and written it as\n\u2032\n\u2032\nmc for Cm,2 . The reasons for this will become clear shortly.\n7\n\n\fTo see how these two solutions behave as m approaches m\u2032a , and continues beyond this\npoint, let us note that\ncosh \u03ba1,2 =\n\n|t1 | \u2213 [t21 \u2212 4t2 f ]1/2\n.\n4t2\n\n(2.17)\n\nAs m \u2192 m\u2032a \u2212, cosh \u03ba1 \u2192 1, i.e., \u03ba1 \u2192 0, while cosh \u03ba2 \u2192 \u22121 + 2|t1 |/4t2 > 1. As we cross\nthe point m\u2032a , q1 will become real, while q2 will continue to be pure imaginary and large.\n\u2032\n\u2032\nThus the solution Cm,2\ncontinues to hold at m\u2032a , while Cm,1\nbreaks down at m\u2032a [18], and\nmust be related to a the solution for m > m\u2032a by a connection formula. It is clear that the\n\u2032\nwavevector(s) for Cm,2\nwill continue to be given by Eq. (2.17) as m \u2192 m\u2032b \u2212, while those\n\u2032\nfor Cm,1\nwill again approach zero, necessitating the use of connection formulas to go on\nto m > m\u2032b . It is here that the technical remark about sidestepping the use of connection\nformulas that was made in connection with the continuum antisymmetric double-well is\n\u2032\nrelevant. The solution Cm,1\ncan be approximated by a harmonic oscillator wavefunction\nprovided the energy E is not very far from the minima of U0 . The asymptotic forms of this\nwavefunction give us the quasiclassical wavefunction in the regions m < m\u2032a and m\u2032b more\nsimply. We therefore turn to this subproblem.\nD. Jumping across the potential well\n\nThe assumption that E \u2212 U0 (\u03bc0\u00b1 ) is not very large, means that q1 (m) is never very far\nfrom zero, and we may expand Hsc (q, m) in powers of q and m + m\u20320 . As in I, we write\nHsc (q, m) = E\u2212 +\n\n1 2 1\n2\nq + M\u2212 \u03c9\u2212\n(m \u2212 m0\u2212, )2 + * * * .\n2M\u2212\n2\n\n(2.18)\n\n\u2032\nSince q and m are conjugate variables, we can write Cm,1\nas the solution to the differential\nequation\n\u2032\n\u2032\nHsc (\u2212i\u2202m , m)Cm,1\n= ECm,1\n.\n\n(2.19)\n\nIntroducing two new variables z and \u03bd \u2032 by the equations\nm = m0\u2212 + (2M\u2212 \u03c90\u2212 )\u22121/2 z,\nE = E\u2212 + (\u03bd \u2032 + 21 )\u03c90\u2212 ,\n\n(2.20)\n(2.21)\n\nwithin the approximation (2.18), the differential equation becomes that for the parabolic\ncylinder functions:\n\"\n\n1 z2\nd2\n\u2032\n+\n\u03bd\n+\n\u2212\ndz 2\n2\n4\n\n!#\n\n\u2032\nCm,1\n= 0.\n\n(2.22)\n\nIf we take as the two linearly independent solutions the standard forms D\u03bd \u2032 (z) and D\u03bd \u2032 (\u2212z)\n[19], the former must be rejected as it diverges for z \u2192 \u2212\u221e. We accordingly write\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\nCm,1\n= A\u2032 (\u22121)l D\u03bd \u2032 (\u2212z),\n\n8\n\n(2.23)\n\n\f\u2032\n\nwhere A\u2032 is the constant in Eq. (2.15), and the additional factor (\u22121)l , where we shall define\nl\u2032 shortly, is another constant introduced for later convenience.\n\u2032\n2\nAs z \u2192 \u2212\u221e, D\u03bd \u2032 (\u2212z) \u223c (\u2212z)\u03bd e\u2212z /4 , and one can show with a little work that [modulo\n\u2032\n\u2032\nthe factor (\u22121)l ] this is indeed the DPI form for Cm,1\nwith the approximation (2.18) [20].\nFor z \u2192 +\u221e, on the other hand,\n\u03bd\u2032\n\n\u2212z 2 /4\n\n!\n\n\u03bd \u2032 (\u03bd \u2032 \u2212 1)\n+***\n1\u2212\n2z 2\n\nD\u03bd \u2032 (\u2212z) \u223c cos(\u03c0\u03bd \u2032 )z e\n\u221a\n!\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u03bd \u2032 \u22121 z 2 /4\n(\u03bd \u2032 + 1)(\u03bd \u2032 + 2)\n1+\nz\ne\n+*** .\n+\n\u0393(\u2212\u03bd \u2032 )\n2z 2\n\n(2.24)\n\nNote that this form has both decaying and growing components. In fact, the latter component vanishes only if \u03bd \u2032 is a positive a integer. As explained earlier, it is essential for our\n\u2032\nDPI solution Cm\nto contain a growing component. We therefore allow for its presence by\nwriting\n\u01eb\u2032\n,\n\u03c90\u2212\n\n\u03bd \u2032 = l\u2032 +\n\n(2.25)\n\nwhere l\u2032 is a positive integer, and \u01eb\u2032 is a shift defined to lie in the interval (\u22121/2, 1/2)\u03c90\u2212.\nIn fact, we expect \u01eb\u2032 to be very close to zero for any state in which there is large probaility\nof finding the particle in the left well. We can make the vanishing of the growing component\n\u2032\nin Cm,1\nmore manifest by writing\n1\nsin(\u03c0\u03bd \u2032 )\n\u01eb\u2032\n\u2032\nl\u2032 +1 \u2032\n=\n\u2212\n\u0393(1\n+\n\u03bd\n)\n\u2248\n(\u22121)\n(l\n!)\n.\n\u0393(\u2212\u03bd \u2032 )\n\u03c0\n\u03c90\u2212\n\n(2.26)\n\nCombining Eqs.

DPI form in ordinary forbidden region\n\u2032\nThe next step is to write the solution for Cm\nin such a way that it holds in the entire\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nregion mb < m < mc [18]. For Cm,2 , Eq. (2.16) already meets this demand, since just as at\n\u2032\nthe turning point m\u2032a , q2 stays imaginary and negative as m passes through m\u2032c . For Cm,1\n, on\nthe other hand, Eq. (2.27) only holds in a region where the parabolic approximation to U0\nis good, and may not hold near m\u2032c . It is clear, however, that the wavevector q1 associated\n\u2032\nwith Cm,1\nis again given by \u2212i\u03ba1 with \u03ba1 given by Eq. (2.17). Hence it must be possible to\n\u2032\nwrite Cm,1 in the DPI form\n\n\u2032\nCm,1\n\n= |v1 (m)|\n\n\u22121/2\n\n\"\n\n\u2032\n\nQ exp \u2212i\n\nZ\n\nm\nm\u2032b\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nq1 (m )dm\n\n9\n\n!\n\n\u2032\n\n+ R exp i\n\nZ\n\nm\n\nm\u2032b\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nq1 (m )dm\n\n!#\n\n,\n\n(2.28)\n\n\fwhere Q\u2032 and R\u2032 are coefficients which we expect to be proportional to A\u2032 .

Note that since we took A\u2032 to be real, Q\u2032 and R\u2032 are also real.\n\u2032\nTo summarize where we are, the complete DPI solution for Cm\nin the region m\u2032b < m < m\u2032c\n\u2032\nis given by the sum of Eqs. (2.16) and (2.28). The terms in B and R\u2032 are exponentially\ngrowing with increasing m, while the term in Q\u2032 is exponentially decreasing. The next step\nis to connect this solution to the DPI form in the region m\u2032c < m. As already stated, the\nturning point m\u2032c is the irregular one under the barrier, where exponentially growing and\ndecaying wavefunctions acquire oscillatory envelopes as it is crossed.\nBefore we use the connection formulas at m\u2032c , it is useful to see how the quasiclassical\nwavevector behaves near this point. Since cos q(m\u2032c ) = cos q \u2217 = \u2212t1 (m\u2032c )/4t2 (m\u2032c ), it follows\nthat the discriminant in Eq. (2.12) vanishes at m\u2032c , and both q1 and q2 tend to the same value\n\u2212i\u03ba\u2032c , where\n10\n\n\fcosh \u03ba\u2032c = (|t1 |/4t2 )m=m\u2032c .\n\n(2.35)\n\nAs we cross m\u2032c , the discriminant in Eq. (2.12) becomes negative and cos q(m) [and therefore\nq(m)] becomes complex. We separate q(m) into its real and imaginary parts, and write two\ndistinct solutions as\n(m > m\u2032c )\n\nqd,g (m) = \u00b1i\u03ba(m) + \u03c7(m),\n\n(2.36)\n\nwhere both \u03ba and \u03c7 are real and positive. The subscripts d and g stand for 'decaying' and\n'growing'.\nF. DPI form in oscillatory forbidden region\n\nThe connection formulas to be used at m\u2032c were derived in Sec. IV of Ref. [16].

By defining\n\u2032\u2032\na new variable n = \u2212m, so that the problem for Cm\nbecomes completely isomorphic to that\n\u2032\nfor Cm , and then transforming back to m, one can show that\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u0393 =\n\u03a6\u2032\u2032\u2212+ (m)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nm\u2032\u2032\nb\n\nm\u2032\u2032\nc\n\nZ\n\nm\u2032\u2032\nc\n\nm\n\n\u03ba(m\u2032 )dm\u2032 ,\n\n(2.46)\n\n[\u2212\u03ba(m\u2032 ) + i\u03c7(m\u2032 )]dm\u2032 ,\n\n(2.47)\n\netc. Note that since m < m\u2032\u2032c in the center, and m\u2032\u2032c < m\u2032\u2032b , these integrals are written so that\nthe lower limit is less than the upper limit. Thus the suffixes on \u03a6\u2032\u2032 give the true signs of\nits real and imaginary parts.\nG. Matching of left and right wavefunctions\n\nIt remains to see if Eqs.

(2.33) and (2.34)] Q\u2032 and R\u2032 are proportional to A\u2032 , and likewise\nfor Q\u2032\u2032 and R\u2032\u2032 , these equations are two complex equations in the four real quantities A\u2032 , B \u2032 ,\nA\u2032\u2032 and B \u2032\u2032 . To solve them we first note that the imaginary parts on the right hand sides\nmust vanish.

The eigenvalue condition, and the diabolo\n\nThe simplest way of solving Eqs. (2.55) and (2.56) is terms of the ratios \u03b1\u2032 and \u03b2 \u2032 defined\nin Eqs. (2.33) and (2.34), and the analogous ratios \u03b1\u2032\u2032 and \u03b2 \u2032\u2032 . Equating the products of the\nleft hand and right hand sides, and simplifying a little, we get\n\u01eb\u2032 \u01eb\u2032\u2032 = 4\n\n\u03b1\u2032 \u03b1\u2032\u2032\n\u03c90\u2212 \u03c90+ cos2 \u039bc e\u22122\u0393G .\n\u03b2 \u2032 \u03b2 \u2032\u2032\n\n(2.58)\n\nThis is our eigenvalue condition. To understand it better, we first note that the right hand\nside is exponentially small on account of the square of the Gamow factor e\u2212\u0393G . Thus,\nignoring for the moment the possibility that cos \u039bc may vanish, either both \u01eb\u2032 and \u01eb\u2032\u2032 must\nbe of order e\u2212\u0393G , or at the other extreme, one must be of order unity, and the other of\norder e\u22122\u0393G . Suppose that \u01eb\u2032 = O(e\u22122\u0393G ), and \u01eb\u2032\u2032 = O(1). Let us take A\u2032 = 1. Then from\nEqs. (2.33) and (2.34), we see that Q\u2032 = O(1), while R\u2032 = O(e\u22122\u0393G ). It then follows from\nEqs. (2.55) and (2.56) that Q\u2032\u2032 \u223c R\u2032\u2032 = O(e\u2212\u0393G ), and in turn from the double primed analogs\nof Eqs. (2.33) and (2.34) that A\u2032\u2032 = O(e\u2212\u0393G ). Lastly, since \u0393\u2032\u2032 < \u0393G , Eq. (2.54) implies that\nB \u2032\u2032 is also exponentially small [21]. Hence, it follows that the entire wavefunction on the\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\nright hand side of the well, Cm\nis exponentially small compared to the left hand part Cm\n.\n13\n\n\fIn other words, there is negligible mixing of the states in the left and right hand well. This\nis exactly what we expect when the energies of the two states in the absence of tunneling\ndiffer by much more than the tunneling matrix element itself.\nThe more interesting case, therefore, is that in which both \u01eb\u2032 and \u01eb\u2032\u2032 are of order e\u2212\u0393G .\nIn the defining equations for the \u03b1's and \u03b2's, Eqs. (2.33) and (2.34), we can then neglect\nthe \u01eb's to very good approximation. This yields\n\u03b1\u2032\n1 \u0010 \u2032 1 \u0011l\u2032 + 12 \u2212(l\u2032 +\n\u221a\n\u2248\n\u2212\nl +2\ne\n\u03b2\u2032\n2\u03c0l\u2032 !\ng l\u2032\n=\u2212 ,\n2\u03c0\n\n1\n)\n2 ,\n\n(2.59)\n\nwhere gn is the standard curvature correction [22,23] in the phase integral expression for the\ntunnel splitting (see e.g., Eq.

(2.58)\ncan thus be written as \u22062 (l\u2032 , l\u2032\u2032 )/4, where\n\u2206(l\u2032 , l\u2032\u2032 ) =\n\n2\n(gl\u2032 gl\u2032\u2032 )1/2 (\u03c90\u2212 \u03c90+ )1/2 e\u2212\u0393G cos \u039bc .\n\u03c0\n\n(2.60)\n\nWe further define\n\u01eb = 12 (\u01eb\u2032 + \u01eb\u2032\u2032 ) = E \u2212\n\u0010\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nE\u2212 + E+ + (l\u2032 + 12 )\u03c90\u2212 + (l\u2032\u2032 + 21 )\u03c90+ ,\n\u0011\n\n\u03b4 = \u01eb\u2032\u2032 \u2212 \u01eb\u2032 = E\u2212 \u2212 E+ + (l\u2032 + 12 )\u03c90\u2212 \u2212 (l\u2032\u2032 + 12 )\u03c90+ .\nWith these definitions, Eq.

Along with Eqs. (2.60)\u2013(2.62), it is the analog of the general phase\nintegral formula for the tunnel splitting in a symmetric double well that we found in I [see\nEq. (4.38) there]. Since there is no great need for having the final answer in simple closed\nform for the specfic problem (1.1), and since the general procedure is fully explained in\nSec. IV.E of I, we do not bother to extract the singular ln J parts of the \u0393G integral.\nIt is immediately obvious that the eigenvalues in Eq.

The quantity \u01eb is the energy measured from\na convenient reference point, while \u03b4, which depends on the fields hx , hz , and the quantum\nnumbers l\u2032 and l\u2032\u2032 of the states whose mixing is being examined, is the offset between these\nenergy levels in the absence of tunneling. Equation (2.60) gives the tunneling amplitude\nbetween these levels when the offset is small, i.e., when the two levels are in approximate\ndegeneracy. Note that although this amplitude is defined even for relatively large offsets-\noffsets comparable to the intrawell spacings \u03c90\u00b1 -and indeed is not very sensitive to the\n14\n\n\fvalue of the offset, the concept of tunneling is physically sensible and useful only when the\noffset is comparable to or less than the amplitude \u2206. If \u03b4 \u226b \u2206, we get \u01eb \u2248 \u00b1\u03b4/2, i.e.,\n\u01eb\u2032\u2032 \u2248 \u03b4, \u01eb\u2032 \u2248 \u22062 /\u03b4, or the other way around. Then by the argument given after Eq. (2.58),\nthe mixing between the wells is negligible.\nOne may wonder if the above conclusion does not invalidate the entire calculation. After\nall, we defined the shifts \u01eb\u2032 and \u01eb\u2032\u2032 assuming the wells were parabolic. Surely the corrections\nto the energies from cubic and higher order corrections to the potential are far larger than\n\u2206. Since the offset between the levels must be tuned with exponential sensitivity, should not\nwe know the energies of the levels before tunneling to the same sensitivity? The answer is\nno. The reason can be seen from Eq. (2.27). As we have seen, the amplitude of the growing\npart of the wavefunction plays a key role in the tunneling. From Eq. (2.27), we see that\nthis amplitude is only linearly dependent on \u01eb\u2032 . Hence, a small error in locating the absolute\nposition of the level has little effect on the computed value of \u2206. To say it another way, even\nthough we know that the bottoms of the wells must be tuned to exponential accuracy to\nget significant mixing between the two wells, we cannot and need not determine the center\nof gravity of the two levels, \u01eb, to the same accuracy to determine the tunneling amolitude\nitself. This feature is also present in the symmetric case studied in I, although there it is\nnot so apparent, since Herring's formula gives \u2206 directly without making reference to the\nabsolute energy level.\nSecondly, it should be noted that Eq. (2.63) is nothing but the equation for the diabolo.\nThe splitting vanishes only when \u03b4 and \u2206 both vanish, which furnish the two conditions\nrequired to determine the diabolical point. Since both \u03b4 and \u2206 will in general have linear\nterms in the deviation from the diabolical point, the energy surface is a double cone as\nasserted earlier.\nThirdly, let us ask if we recover the results of paper I in the symmetric case, i.e., when\nhz = 0. Then E+ = E\u2212 , M+ = M\u2212 , and \u03c90\u2212 = \u03c90+ . The only sensible case is l\u2032 = l\u2032\u2032 \u2261 n, so\nthat \u01eb\u2032 = \u01eb\u2032\u2032 , and \u03b4 = 0. The splitting is (up to an irrelevant sign) \u2206(n, n), which is precisely\nthe tunnel splitting \u2206n computed in paper I. In addition, however, we now have more\nexplicit information about the wavefunction. Proceeding as before, we see that Q\u2032 \u223c A\u2032 \u223c 1,\n\u2032\nR\u2032 \u223c e\u2212\u0393G , and B \u2032 \u223c e\u2212(\u0393G \u2212\u0393 ) . (The double primed quantities are equal to their single\nprimed counterparts.) The conclusion about B \u2032 is totally consistent with the approach\nin paper I, which\n\u221a was based on Herring's formula. There one takes the wavefunctions as\n(Cm,d \u00b1 C\u2212m,d )/ 2, where Cm,d is the wavefunction of a state localized in the left well, and\n\u2032\nwhich decays away from that well in both directions. If we equate Cm,d with Cm,1a\n(and,\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\ntherefore, C\u2212m,d with Cm,1a ) in the central region, then we see that B , which by Eq. (2.16)\n\u2032\ngives the magnitude of the growing part of Cm\nat m = m\u2032c , is also the order of magnitude of\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nCm,1a\n, the decaying part of Cm\nat m = m\u2032c .\nI. What is the origin of the diabolical points?\n\nLastly, it is extremely instructive to examine the problem when \u2206 = 0, i.e., cos \u039bc = 0,\nwithout necessarily imposing the condition \u03b4 = 0, for this gives insight into what causes the\nquenching of the tunnel splitting. Taking the imaginary parts of Eqs. (2.51) and (2.52) we\nsee directly that we must have R\u2032 = R\u2032\u2032 = 0, and that\n\n15\n\n\f\u2032\u2032\n\nQ\u2032\u2032 = \u00b1B \u2032 e\u0393c +\u0393 ,\n\n\u2032\n\nQ\u2032 = \u00b1B \u2032\u2032 e\u0393c +\u0393 .\n\n(2.65)\n\nGoing back to Eq. (2.34), we see that R\u2032 = 0 requires either \u01eb\u2032 = 0 or A\u2032 = 0, and likewise\nfor R\u2032\u2032 , \u01eb\u2032\u2032 , and A\u2032\u2032 . If \u03b4 6= 0, then both \u01eb\u2032 and \u01eb\u2032\u2032 can not vanish, and the only solution\nis \u01eb\u2032 6= 0, \u01eb\u2032\u2032 = 0, A\u2032\u2032 = Q\u2032\u2032 = B \u2032 = 0, (or the one obtained by interchanging single and\ndouble primes.) The only non-zero coefficients are A\u2032 , Q\u2032 , and B \u2032\u2032 . From Eqs. (2.33) and\n(2.65), we see that only one of these coefficients is independent, which can only be fixed by\n\u2032\u2032\nnormalization. Thus, we see that the part Cm,2\nproportional to B \u2032\u2032 should really be regarded\nas the extreme right-hand tail of a state localized in the left well. If we denote this state by\n|Li, and the wavefunction hm|Li by CL (m), then [18],\n\nCL (m) =\n\n\uf8f1\nR\n\uf8f4\nA\u2032 |v1 (m)|\u22121/2 exp (i m q1 (m\u2032 )dm\u2032 ) ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u2032\n\uf8f4 \u2032\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 A (\u22121)l Dl\u2032 (\u2212z),\n\u0011\n\u0010\nRm\n\u2032\n\u22121/2\n\u2032\n\u2032\n,\nQ\n|v\n(m)|\nexp\n\u2212i\nq\n(m\n)dm\n\u2032\n\uf8f4\n1\nmb 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\uf8f4\nR\n\uf8f4 \u2032\u2032\nm\n\u22121/2\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\uf8f3\n\nB |v1 (m)|\n\nexp \u2212i\n\nm\u2032\u2032\nb\n\nm < m\u2032a ,\nm \u2248 m\u2032a to m \u2248 m\u2032b ,\nm\u2032b < m < m\u2032\u2032b ,\n\n(2.66)\n\nq1 (m )dm , m\u2032\u2032b < m.\n\n[Note that in the second line, we wrote Dl\u2032 , not D\u03bd \u2032 , and that in the third line, we have\nnot bothered to write the oscillatory exponential continuation in the region m\u2032c < m < m\u2032\u2032c\ncorrectly-see Eq. (2.39)-since our aim now is merely to indicate the general structure.]\nWe can define a right-hand function CR (m) analogously. Indeed it is now clear that the two\nstate Hamiltonian (2.64) is a truncation of the full Hamiltonian (1.1) in the |Li, |Ri basis.\nThe above argument shows that for any Hz (\u03b4 6= 0), we can tune Hx so that \u2206 vanishes,\nat which point, the energy eigenfunction is like CL (m) [or CR (m)], which is localized in\none well and does not \"see\" the other well at all! In ordinary one dimensional quantum\nmechanics, this is of course impossible, since a wavefunction like CL (m) which continues\ndecaying with increasing m in the classically allowed region of the right hand well has the\nwrong sign of the curvature in that well. In fact, this argument does not depend on having\n\u03b4 6= 0. If \u03b4 = 0 in addition to \u2206 = 0, CL (m) and CR (m) are independent solutions of\nSchr\u00f6dingers equation, as is any linear combination, since they are degenerate.\nThe above point of view helps elucidate the origin of the quenching more clearly. Indeed, it is better to think about the non-symmetric situation (Hz 6= 0) than the symmetric\none (Hz = 0). In continuum problems with a symmetric double well, Herring's formula\ngives the splitting as proportional to [\u03c8d (x)(d\u03c8d\u2032 /dx)]x=0 , where \u03c8d (x) is a left-well localized\nwavefunction [24]. It is tempting to think that the splitting in the spin problem vanishes\nbecause the oscillatory envelope in Cm,d in the central region allows the discrete analog of\n\u03c8d (x) or \u03c8d\u2032 (x) to vanish at the midpoint. This reasoning is false, as one can see from a close\nexamination of the symmetric case wavefunction, or even more clearly, by looking at the\nsituation when \u2206 = 0 but \u03b4 6= 0. The condition \u2206 = 0 can not be reduced to a local property\nof the wavefunction such as its value or its slope at a particular point. Rather it is the global\nproperty that the phase integral \u039bc be an odd integer times \u03c0/2. From this perspective, the\nquenching is perhaps better visualized as a manifestation of interfering Feynman trajectories\nand the Berry phase, even though the value of this phase is more easily found using the DPI\nmethod.\n\n16\n\n\fIII. APPLICATION TO Fe8\n\nLet us now apply our general formalism to Fe8 . The problem of greatest interest is the\nlocation of the diabolical points, and for that we need only solve the conditions \u03b4 = \u2206 = 0.\nWe have already given formulas for the matrix elements and the critical curves in Eqs. (2.5)\u2013\n(2.10). The problem that remains is to use these formulas to find \u03b4 and \u2206(l\u2032 , l\u2032\u2032 ). To keep\nthe problem tractable and obtain answers in closed form, we will assume that hz is small.\nSpecifically, we will assume that the reduced field hz defined above Eq. (2.8) is formally of\n \u0304 This enables us to evaluate the turning points and action integrals as expansions\norder 1/J.\nin powers of hz . Also, it is convenient to carry out all calculations in terms of the reduced\nvariable \u03bc.\nThe first step is to obtain \u03b4. For this, we need to analyze the critical curve U0 (\u03bc). Its\nminima \u03bc0\u00b1 are found to be located at\n\u03bc0\u00b1\n\nhz h2x\n= \u00b1\u03bc0 +\n+ O(h2z ),\n2\n1 \u2212 hx\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere\n\u03bc0 = (1 \u2212 h2x )1/2 .\n\n(3.2)\n\nThe quantities E\u00b1 , \u03c90\u00b1 , and M\u00b1 defined through Eq. (2.18) are given by\nE\u00b1 \u2261 U0 (\u03bc0\u00b1 ) = \u2212\n\n\"\n\nh2x\n\nh2 h2\n\u00b1 2\u03bc0 hz + z x2 ,\n1 \u2212 hx\n#\n\n(3.3)\n\nhz 1 1 + 2h2x\n2\u03bb1/2 \u03bc0\n1\n\u00b1\n+ O(h2z ) ,\n+\n\u03c90\u00b1 =\nJ \u0304\n2\u03bc0 \u03bb\n1 \u2212 h2x\n\"\n#\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nhz 1\n2\nM\u00b1 =\n1\u2213\n\u2212 2 + O(hz ) .\n2\u03bbh2x\n\u03bc0 \u03bb\n\"\n\n!\n\n#\n\nSubstituting these results in Eq. (2.62), we obtain\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03bbhz\n2 \u03bb\u03bc0 \u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032 \u2032\u2032\n(l \u2212 l ) \u2212  \u0304 (l\u2032 + l\u2032\u2032 + 1)c1 (hx ) + O(J \u0304\u22123 ),\n\u03b4(hz , l , l ) = 4\u03bc0hz +\n \u0304\nJ\nJ\n\n(3.4)\n(3.5)\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere\n1 \u2212 h2x + \u03bb(1 + 2h2x )\nc1 (hx ) =\n.\n\u03bb(1 \u2212 h2x )\n\n(3.7)\n\nThe next step is to evaluate \u2206(l\u2032 , l\u2032\u2032 ), or more precisely \u039bc , the imaginary part of the\nphase integral defined in Eq. (2.50), since that by itself locates the diabolical points. This in\nturn requires expressions for \u03c7(m) and the points m\u2032c and m\u2032\u2032c . To obtain \u03c7(m), we return to\nthe Hamilton-Jacobi equation Eq. (2.4), write q = \u03ba + i\u03c7, and separate the equation into its\nreal and imaginary parts. Eliminating \u03ba(m) from the two equations that result, we obtain\na single equation for \u03c7(m), which can be written as\n\n17\n\n\ft21 (m)\n= 0;\n4t2 (m)\ng(m) = w(m) + 2t2 (m) \u2212 E,\n\n4t2 (m)X 2 \u2212 g(m)X +\n\n(3.8)\n(3.9)\n\nwhere X \u2261 cos \u03c7(m). [We can find the equation obeyed by \u03ba(m) similarly, and we discover\nthat it is again Eq. (3.8) with X = cosh \u03ba(m).]\nWhat value of E should we use in Eq. (3.8)? As stated earlier, the value of \u2206 is relatively\ninsensitive to small changes in the absolute position of E. Thus we certainly needn't incorporate the exponentially small shifts caused by the tunneling itself. Secondly, the tunneling\nis relevant only when \u03b4 \u223c \u2206. Thus it suffices to set both \u01eb\u2032 and \u01eb\u2032\u2032 to 0 in this part of the\ncalculation. Then, Eqs. (2.61), (3.3), and (3.4), we get\n\u0011\n1\u0010\nE\u2212 + E+ + (l\u2032 + 21 )\u03c90\u2212 + (l\u2032\u2032 + 21 )\u03c90+\n2\n\u221a\n\u03bb\u03bc0\n= \u2212h2x +  \u0304 (l\u2032 + l\u2032\u2032 + 1) + O(J \u0304\u22122 ).\nJ\n\nE=\n\n(3.10)\n\nSubstituting this along with the formulas for w(m), t1 (m), and t2 (m) in Eqs. (3.8) and (3.9),\nyields the following equation for X:\nh2x\n= 0;\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb)(1 \u2212 \u03bc2 )X 2 \u2212 [1 + h2x \u2212 \u03bc2 \u2212 \u03b6(\u03bc)]X +\n1\u2212\u03bb\n\u221a\n\u03bb\n\u03b6(\u03bc) =  \u0304 [\u03bc(l\u2032\u2032 \u2212 l\u2032 ) + \u03bc0 (l\u2032 + l\u2032\u2032 + 1)].\nJ\n\n(3.11)\n(3.12)\n\nWe have separated out the term \u03b6(\u03bc) in Eq. (3.11) as it is of order J \u0304\u22121 relative to the other\nterms. We can solve the quadratic equation and expand the result as a power series in \u03b6.\nRecalling that X = cos2 \u03c7, we obtain\n\"\n\n#\n\n\u03b6(\u03bc)\n1+\ncos \u03c7(\u03bc) = q\n+ O(\u03b6 2) .\n2\n2\n2(1 \u2212 hx \u2212 \u03bc )\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb)(1 \u2212 \u03bc2 )\nhx\n\n(3.13)\n\nBy setting cos \u03c7 = 1, we can determine the points \u03bc\u2032c and \u03bc\u2032\u2032c , for which it is now more\nconvenient to write \u03bcc\u00b1 instead. If the correction \u03b6 were absent, it is easy to see that these\npoints would be at \u00b1\u03bcc0 , where\n\u03bcc0 = [(1 \u2212 \u03bb \u2212 h2x )/(1 \u2212 \u03bb)]1/2 .\n\n(3.14)\n\nNow, with \u03b6 6= 0, we can find \u03bcc\u00b1 as a series in J \u0304\u22121 . Up to leading corrections, we get\n1\n\u03bcc\u00b1 = \u00b1\u03bcc0 \u2212 \u221a\n[\u03bcc0 (l\u2032\u2032 \u2212 l\u2032 ) \u00b1 \u03bc0 (l\u2032 + l\u2032\u2032 + 1)].\n \u0304\n2 \u03bb\u03bcc0 J\n\n(3.15)\n\nThe phase integral \u039bc is given by\n\u039bc = J \u0304\n\nZ\n\n\u03bcc+\n\n\u03bcc\u2212\n\n\u03c7(\u03bc)d\u03bc.\n\n18\n\n(3.16)\n\n\fWe will only evaluate this accurate to terms of order J \u03040 . Let us first consider the corrections\nentailed by replacing the limits by \u00b1\u03bcc0 . It is not difficult to show that without the \u03b6 term\nin Eq. (3.13),\n\u221a\n1\u2212\u03bb 2\n\u03c7(\u03bc) \u2248\n(\u03bcc0 \u2212 \u03bc2 )1/2 as \u03bc \u2192 \u03bcc0 .\n(3.17)\nhx\nInclusion of the \u03b6 correction does not change the square root approach to zero, and can not\nchange the coefficient to leading order in J \u0304\u22121 . From Eq. (3.15), \u03bcc\u00b1 differs from \u00b1\u03bcc0 by\nterms of order J \u0304\u22121 , so ignoring these shifts in the limits of the integral causes an error of\norder J \u0304\u22123/2 in the integral. Hence, we have\n\u039bc \u2248 J \u0304\n\nZ\n\n\u03bcc0\n\n\u03c7(\u03bc)d\u03bc + O(J \u0304\u22121/2 ).\n\n(3.18)\n\n\u2212\u03bcc0\n\nThe error is smaller than O(J \u03040), and so may be ignored. The remaining integral may be\ndone exactly as in paper I. We write the solution to Eq.

From the viewpoint of our DPI calculations, this exactness is somewhat\nmysterious. However, by the duality argument of Sec. I, if formulas (3.22) and (3.22) are\ncorrect for small Hz and large Hx , then they also yield diabolical points for large Hz and\nsmall Hx . Of course if the former set of points corresponds to low lying levels, i.e., small\nvalues of l\u2032 and l\u2032\u2032 , to which our analysis applies, the latter set of points corresponds to rather\nhighly excited levels, to which the analysis does not apply prima facie. It is nevertheless\nsurprising that the formulas should fit together so neatly. It is also somewhat surprising\nthat the experimentally determined Fe8 diabolical points [for the cases (l\u2032 , l\u2032\u2032 ) = (0, 0), (0, 1),\nand (0, 2)] should lie on a centered rectangular structure so closely, since, as is known, the\nvalue of the measured Hx period on the Hz = 0 line is almost 50% different from that\npredicted by Eq. (3.23). This feature is at present understood only on the basis of numerical\ndiagonalization of the spin Hamiltonian including fourth order terms in J. An analytic\napproach to this aspect of the problem remains for the future.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work is supported by the NSF via grant number DMR-9616749.

For complex, but\nstill Hermitean matrices, the argument of Ref. [12] is easily generalized to show that\none needs three tunable parameters. The third parameter is Hy , and it needs to be set\nexactly to zero for the diabolical points considered in this paper. Whether or not there\nare additional points in the full three dimensional magnetic field space with Hy 6= 0 has\nnot, to our knowledge, been studied.\nE. Teller, J. Phys. Chem. 41, 109 (1937).\nR. B.

[16], all DPI solutions break down in a narrow region\nof width O(J 1/3 ) surrounding a turning point. Throughout this paper, when we give\nthe region of validity of such a solution in the form of an inequality such as m\u2032a < m or\nm < m\u2032b , it is to be tacitly understood that the breakdown region is excluded. It would\nbe very tedious to say so explicitly every single time.\nWe use the conventions of C. M. Bender and S. A.

The numbers in parentheses\ngive the power of 10 multiplying the number preceding.
