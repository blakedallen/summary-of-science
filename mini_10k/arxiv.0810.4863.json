As this can, potentially, be explained with\na modification to General Relativity we look at current cosmological data with the\npurpose of testing aspects of gravity. Firstly we constrain a phenomenological model\n(mDGP) motivated by a possible extra dimension. This is characterised by a parameter\n\u03b1 which interpolates between \u03b1 = 0 (LCDM) and \u03b1 = 1 (the Dvali Gabadadze Porrati\n(DGP) model). In addition, we analyse general signatures of modified gravity given\nby the growth parameter \u03b3 and power spectrum parameter \u03a3. We utilise large angular\nscale (\u03b8 > 30 arcminutes) Weak Lensing data (CFHTLS-wide) in order to work in\nthe more linear regime and then add, in combination, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations\n(BAOs) and Supernovae. We subsequently show that current weak lensing data is not\nyet capable of constraining either model in isolation. However we demonstrate that\neven at present this probe is highly beneficial, for in combination with BAOs and\nSupernovae we obtain \u03b1 < 0.58 and \u03b1 < 0.91 at 1\u03c3 and 2\u03c3, respectively. Without\nthe lensing data no constraint is possible. Inclusion of all angular scales (1 6 \u03b8 6 230\narcminutes) allows a noticeable but not significant increase in the constraining power\nof the joint probes with \u03b1 < 0.56 and \u03b1 < 0.86 also at 1\u03c3 and 2\u03c3, respectively. Both\nanalyses correspond to a disfavouring of the flat DGP braneworld model (\u03b1 = 1) at\nover 2\u03c3. We highlight these are insensitive to potential systematics in the lensing data\nsuch as an underestimation of the shear at high redshift. For the growth signature \u03b3 we\nshow that, in combination, these probes do not yet have sufficient constraining power.\nFinally, we look beyond these present capabilities and demonstrate that Euclid, a\nfuture weak lensing survey, will deeply probe the nature of gravity. A 1\u03c3 error of 0.104\nis found for \u03b1 (lmax = 500) whereas for the general modified signatures we forecast 1\u03c3\nerrors of 0.045 for \u03b3 and 0.25 for \u03a30 (lmax = 500), which is further tightened to 0.038\nfor \u03b3 and 0.069 for \u03a30 (lmax = 10000).\nKey words: Weak lensing, Modified Gravity, CFHTLS and Euclid.\n\n1\n\u22c6\n\nBased on observations obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam,\na joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the CanadaFrance-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institut National\ndes Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche\nScientifique (CNRS) of France, and the University of Hawaii. This\nwork is based in part on data products produced at Terapix and\nthe Canadian Astronomy Data Centre as part of the CanadaFrance-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey, a collaborative project\nof NRC and CNRS.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGeneral relativity, a cornerstone of physics, is arguably one\nof our greatest intellectual achievements. It is not only elegant and physically motivated, but it makes a whole host\nof predictions including gravitational waves, the anomalous\nprecession of Mercury and the deflection of light\u2013all of which\nhave been verified.\nFurther still, due to its weak yet accumulative nature,\ngravitation is a force of the large scale. And so cosmology,\nbeing the study of the Universe, is a field performed within\nthe formalism of this theory. It is in this way that Cosmology\n\n\f2\n\nThomas et al.\n\nitself becomes yet a further test for gravity. Considering this,\ntoday's cosmologists have been posed the most tantalising\nproblem: given that recent precision data from Supernovae,\nthe Cosmic Microwave Background and large scale structure (E.g. Astier et al. (2006), Dunkley et al. (2008) and\nPercival et al. (2007)) all indicate that the Universe is undergoing a period of cosmic acceleration, do we treat this as\nevidence that Einstein's theory of gravitation, or the manner\nin which we implement it, is incomplete? Or, more conventionally, should we stand by this successful theory and invoke\nsome new matter component\u2013Dark Energy\u2013to explain it?\nHere we study the former and investigate the idea that\nGeneral Relativity is not general enough. We do not attempt to motivate a new theory of gravity itself but instead\naim towards testing existing theories and aspects of general theories with current and future data. In Section 2 we\nreview the concept of modified gravity, including a generalised braneworld model (Dvali & Turner 2003) we go on to\nconstrain, and touch upon some of its interesting features.\nOne example feature, and thus potential signature of modified gravity, concerns the growth of structure. In Section 3\nwe look deeper at this growth characteristic and attempts\nto generally parameterise it analogous to the equation of\nstate for dark energy. We highlight how this extra richness\nin modified gravity can break the observational degeneracy\nwith dark energy models and discuss the ensuing limitations. In addition, we note how modified gravity alters the\nrelationship, relative to GR, between the power spectrum\nof the potentials and the matter power spectrum which is\nimplicit within weak lensing. Section 4 introduces weak gravitational lensing and its particular importance to modified\ngravity given that it is sensitive to the expansion history, the\ngrowth of structure and the power spectrum. In this section\nwe also detail the survey and data that we use (CFHTLSwide: Fu et al. (2008) - From here on F08) and follow with a\ndiscussion of the working caveats, including non-linearities,\nand how this data in particular circumvents the issue. Section 5.1 subsequently contains the analysis and constraints\nof the general braneworld-like model and parameterisation\nof growth through lensing. It is promptly followed in Section 5.2 by the addition of BAO and Supernovae data to\nimprove upon these constraints and break parameter degeneracies. For all the analyses in Section 5.1 and Section 5.2\nwe implement a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) approach with CosmoMC1 (Lewis & Bridle 2002) where the\nresulting plots have been produced with CosmoloGUI2 . In\nSection 5.3 we briefly highlight potential systematics in the\ndata and quantify any effect on the constraints. We also look\nbeyond present day constraints on gravity in Section 6 and\nsee how the highly exciting future weak lensing probe Euclid (Refregier et al. (2008) and Cimatti et al. (2008)) will\nbe able to distinguish between General Relativity and other\nmodels of cosmic acceleration and growth. We finish in Section 7 with a summary of the paper including a discussion of\nthe caveats and limitations as well as suggestions for future\nwork.\n\n1\n2\n\nhttp://cosmologist.info/cosmomc/\nhttp://www.sarahbridle.net/cosmologui/\n\n2\n\nMODIFIED GRAVITY\n\nGeneral relativity itself is a modification of gravity. It superseded the previous established theory of gravity, Newton's Law of Gravitation, with a breathtaking physical principle and mechanism for gravitation phenomena. Although\nan enormous and elegant change in how we think about\ngravity it was quite simply necessary: The previous gravitational framework did not explain all gravitational processes.\nFor example, it did not account for the anomalous precession of Mercury. Given the success of Newton's theory many\nattempts were made to understand this within the existing\nframework. In fact, even a form of dark matter was invoked\nin the form of an unseen planet to cause the required procession.\nToday one may argue we face a similar choice with the\nevidence of accelerated expansion in the Universe. Again\nearly attempts have tried to incorporate some new matter component within the formalism of our current theory of gravity. The simplest procedure has been to introduce a cosmological constant\u2013perhaps arising from vacuum\nenergy\u2013to the usual Einstein field equations. However, a\ndisagreement of 120 orders of magnitude represents a severe fine tuning problem. Other similar avenues have included the introduction of a dynamical scalar field which\nis either trapped within a false vacuum or slowly rolling\ndown a potential (E.g. Wetterich (1988), Peebles & Ratra\n(1988), Frieman et al. (1995), Ferreira & Joyce (1998) and\nAlbrecht & Skordis (2000)). These Quintessence or dark energy models can potentially lead to the desired acceleration.\nAlternatively the more radical, but historically successful, route is with another modification to gravity. Starting\nfrom the assumption that any viable theory is described by a\nLangrangian one might at first consider adding terms to the\nRicci scalar (R) in the Einstein-Hilbert action for General\nRelativity given below,\n\nIG \u2261 \u2212\n\n1\n16\u03c0G\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n\n\u2212gR d4 x.\n\n(1)\n\nIn fact this procedure was performed some time ago in\nthe context of inflation (Starobinskii 1980) but has more\nrecently been analysed for the late-time low curvature universe, in e.g. Carroll et al. (2004), where the term 1/R was\nadded. It was found to have the desired effect of acceleration but is ultimately unfeasible as a realistic alternative\ndue to its failure to comply with solar system constraints\n(Chiba et al. 2006). A generalised modification could assume that the correct underlying theory must be some general function of the Ricci scalar. These models, called f(R)\nmodels, are being studied extensively in the literature. One\ncould potentially generalise this even further to functions of\nthe Ricci tensor R\u03bc\u03bd and curvature tensor R\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 , resulting\nin f(R,R\u03bc\u03bd R\u03bc\u03bd ,R\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 R\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 ) gravity. However, this general\ngravity suffers from higher order instabilities, through Ostrogradski's theorem (Woodard 2007), and so analysis has\ntended to focus on f(R). It is not exclusively this subset\nof theoretical space that suffers theoretical problems however. Healthly theories of gravity seem to be particularly\nrare with most suffering from a whole host of theoretical\nafflictions, from ghost negative energy states to tachyonic\nbehaviour (Durrer & Maartens 2007). It is also worth not-\n\n\fWeak Lensing and Modified Gravity\ning that if any of these remaining problem-free theories are\nsuccessful in explaining the observed acceleration we are also\nfaced with the challenge of explaining why vacuum energy,\nmentioned earlier, does not gravitate!\nBeyond generalising the function in the Lagrangian we\ncould also look to higher dimensional models. Within the\ncontext of cosmology this braneworld scenario can somewhat\nbe described as string theory inspired. For example, normal\nmatter might be confined to a 4-dimensional brane, where\nthe conservation equation \u03c1\u0307 + 3H(\u03c1 + p) = 0 holds firm,\nbut gravity is free to roam into a higher dimensional bulk.\nOne particular braneworld scenario, the Randall-Sundrum\nmodel (Randall & Sundrum 1999), approximates to standard gravity at low energies but becomes five dimensional\nfor high energy and small length scales. For late time acceleration however we desire something that will change over\nlarge distances and low energy scales. The DGP model3 of\nDvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (Dvali et al. 2000), described by\nthe Lagrangian in Equation (2), is exactly this.\nIG \u2261\n\n\u22121 h 1\n16\u03c0G rc\n\nZ\n\nd5 x\nbulk\n\np\n\n\u2212g (5) R(5) +\n\nZ\n\nbrane\n\ni\n\u221a\nd4 x \u2212gR\n\n(2)\nIt was originally created consisting of a 4-dimensional\nMinkowski brane within a 5-dimensional Minkowski bulk\nand with no motivation towards explaining dark energy.\nHowever the generalisation (Deffayet 2001) to a FriedmannRobertson-Walker brane gave rise to a self-accelerating solution. Gravity leaking from this 4D brane into the bulk over\nlarge scales gives rise to the acceleration through a weakening effect. The resulting Friedmann equation is a modification to the General Relativistic case and is given by Equation\n(3) with rc , the cross over scale, specified in Equation (4).\n8\u03c0G\u03c1\nH\n=\nrc\n3\n\n(3)\n\n1\nH0 (1 \u2212 \u03a9m )\n\n(4)\n\nH2 \u2212\nrc =\n\nWith this modification we have a full description of the\nexpansion history. This also allows us to work towards understanding the growth of large scale structure giving two\nobservational signatures that would enable us to carry out a\ncosmological study. The difference in the background acceleration itself is enough to produce a difference in the growth\nof structure. This can be seen in the second term, the Hubble drag, in the growth of density perturbations \u03b4, for GR\nbelow,\n\u03b4\u0308 + 2H \u03b4\u0307 = 4\u03c0G\u03c1m \u03b4.\n\n(5)\n\nHowever, assuming that the only alteration is via\nchanges in H is fortunately incorrect. It is fortunate because it is the extra modification that allows us to break the\ndegeneracy between some general dark energy within GR,\nwhich can replicate any desired expansion history, and this\nmodified gravity model (this will be addressed in more detail\nin Section 3). The correct approach regarding the evolution\n\nof perturbations in this gravitational framework is particularly difficult and was tackled by Lue et al. (2004) and then\nby Koyama & Maartens (2006). It was found that treating\ngravity as 4-dimensional, which leads to Equation (5), induces an inconsistency in the 4-dimensional Bianchi identities. Instead with the full and complete five-dimensional\nanalysis, and assumptions of a quasi-static regime and subhorizon scales, they found the metric perturbations on the\nbrane to be,\nk2 \u03c6 = \u22124\u03c0Ga2 (1 \u2212\n\n1\n)\u03c1m \u03b4\n3\u03b2\n\n(6)\n\nk2 \u03c8 = \u22124\u03c0Ga2 (1 +\n\n1\n)\u03c1m \u03b4\n3\u03b2\n\n(7)\n\nwhere\n\nSee Lue (2006) for an extensive review.\n\n\u03b2 = 1 \u2212 2rc H(1 +\n\n\u1e22\n).\n3H 2\n\n(8)\n\nIt is this \u03b2 factor within Equation (7) that breaks the\nexpansion degeneracy and modifies Equation (5) becoming\nrather,\n\"\n1 \"\n\u03c1m \u03b4.\n\u03b4\u0308 + 2H \u03b4\u0307 = 4\u03c0G 1 +\n3\u03b2\n\n(9)\n\nOne can see the effect of this analysis by looking at Figure 1. We have plotted the linear growth factor for LCDM,\nDGP and a dark energy model with the same expansion\nhistory as DGP. It is evident that the expansion history has\nconsiderable influence on the linear growth of structure with\na suppression in the dark energy model relative to a cosmological constant. The effect of the five-dimensional perturbation analysis adds to this suppression and acts to clarify\nthe deviation between the dark energy and DGP model.\nWith the modified Friedman equation, the correct linear\ngrowth equation and several caveats it is now possible for one\nto perform tests on the expansion history and/or large scale\nstructure for this particular modification to gravity. Some\nof these tests already exist and it has been found that DGP\nis under tension from the recent influx of cosmological data\n(E.g. Song et al. (2007) and references therein). It is also\nworth noting that this model is potentially not without some\nof the theoretical problems alluded to above with notions of\na ghost (Koyama (2005) and Gorbunov et al. (2006)) and a\nstrong coupling problem (Rubakov 2003).\nWe do, however, go beyond DGP as an isolated theory\nand examine a phenomenological model that is motivated by\nthe concept of an extra dimension with infinite extent. This\nmodel, first introduced by Dvali & Turner (2003), interpolates between LCDM and DGP and allows for the presence\nof the extra dimension through corrections to the Friedmann\nequation with the addition of the parameter \u03b1 shown in\nEquation (10) and rc in Equation (11).\nH2 \u2212\nwhere\n\n3\n\n3\n\nH\u03b1\n8\u03c0G\u03c1\n=\n3\nrc2\u2212\u03b1\n1\n\nrc = (1 \u2212 \u03a9m ) \u03b1\u22122 H0\u22121 .\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\nIt is clear that in this case LCDM is recovered when \u03b1 = 0\n\n\f4\n\nThomas et al.\n1\n\n1\n\n0.95\n\n0.95\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n0.85\n\ng(a) \u2261 \u03b4(a)/ a\n\ng(a) \u2261 \u03b4(a)/ a\n\nLCDM\n\n0.8\nDE\n\n0.75\n0.7\n\nLCDM (\u03b1=0)\n\n0.85\n0.8\n0.75\n\nDGP (\u03b1=1)\n\n0.7\nDGP\n\n0.65\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.65\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nScale Factor (a)\n\nand DGP when \u03b1 = 1. Furthermore, it is worth noting\nthat \u03b1 < 0 leads to effective equation of states less than\n\u22121, whereas \u03b1 & 1 acts to disrupt both the long matter\nera needed for structure formation and the limits set by\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), while \u03b1 > 2 corresponds\nto early universe braneworld modifications. Using Equation\n(10) it is possible to test the model with probes of the expansion history and indeed this has already been performed by\nYamamoto et al. (2006) with Baryon Acoustic Oscillations.\nIf one wants to go beyond this and include tests of large\nscale structure then one needs a formalism for the growth of\ndensity perturbations analogous to Equations (7), (8) and\ntherefore (9). The problem in this scenario is that in order\nto deduce the growth of perturbations one needs an underlying covariant theory and all that exists in this modified\nDGP model (mDGP) is a parameterisation. Koyama (2006)\ncircumvented this obstacle by taking DGP (a limit in the\nmodel) as the structure of the theory. It was subsequently\nfound that the metric perturbations take the same form as\nEquations (6) and (7) but instead with,\n\"\n2\n(2 \u2212 \u03b1)\u1e22 \"\n(Hrc )2\u2212\u03b1 1 +\n.\n\u03b1\n3H 2\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nScale Factor (a)\n\nFigure 1. g(a) \u2261 \u03b4(a)/a, the linear growth, is plotted for a range\nof late time acceleration models. The solid line demonstrates the\ngrowth for LCDM, the dashed for the five-dimensional braneworld\nmodel DGP and the dotted for a dark energy model with identical expansion history to DGP (w0 = \u22120.78 and wa = 0.32\nwhere w(a) = w0 + (1 \u2212 a)wa ). The difference in the expansion\nhistory seems to give a significant suppression in growth relative to a pure cosmological constant. The effect, however, of the\nfive-dimensional perturbation analysis not only adds to the suppression for DGP but breaks the degeneracy between itself and\nthe attempt at replication from the smooth dark energy model.\n\n\u03b2 =1\u2212\n\n0\n\n(12)\n\nFigure 2 demonstrates how the growth of density pertubations alter within the mDGP model - from LCDM (\u03b1 = 0)\nto DGP (\u03b1 = 1). As in the previous Figure it is clear that\n\nFigure 2. g(a) \u2261 \u03b4(a)/a, the linear growth, is plotted for various values of \u03b1 that characterise the phenomenological general\nbraneworld-like (mDGP) model. The solid line demonstrates the\ngrowth for \u03b1 = 0 (LCDM), the dashed for \u03b1 = 0.25, the dashdotted for \u03b1 = 0.5 and the dotted for \u03b1 = 1 (DGP). Once again\nit is evident that the more DGP-like end of the \u03b1 spectrum experiences more suppression in the growth of density perturbations.\n\nthere is a suppression of growth at the more DGP end of\nthe \u03b1 spectrum.\nAlthough a parameterisation of a general large extra dimensional model the mDGP model now has a definite Friedmann equation that governs the expansion history and, assuming the structure of any underlying theory, it has a set\nof metric perturbation equations and a corresponding density perturbation equation. We can therefore treat this as\na specific model which we choose to constrain later in the\npaper. It is worth noting that using this as a measure of\ndeviation from General Relativity or as a parameterisation\nof general modified gravity is not our aim. This would constitute a poor choice of parameter given the severe lack of\ngeneralness and incompleteness with regards to the concept\nof modified gravity as a whole. We do however touch upon\nthe idea of parameterising modified gravity in the next section. This model has, however, been extremely illustrative\nwith regards to the extra richness that can occur in modified gravity. Not only does it have varying expansion histories but potentially a whole range of perturbation equations\nwhich alters the growth of structure and the relationship\nto the power spectrum. This is particularly useful when attempting to distinguish between LCDM, general dark energy\nand modified gravity, and insightful to the probes that will\nbe most adept at detecting them. Again, we discuss these\nissues in the following sections.\n\n\f5\n\nWeak Lensing and Modified Gravity\nGROWTH\n\nThe alteration in the growth of structure within the mDGP\nmodel demonstrated an additional observational characteristic that allows us to further constrain the model and potentially break the degeneracy with an expansion replicating\ndark energy. It also highlights the possibility of searching for\nsignatures of modified gravity in current data by looking for\nchanges in the growth of structure. However, even if we do\nhave a plethora of new and viable physical principles that\nexplain dark energy naturally we might want a way to quantify how these models affect this growth signature. If we do\nnot have the models we might just want to test the influx of\ndata for hints of something unusual. Either way it is possible\nto parameterise this extra growth.\nThis notion of parameterising growth is analogous to\nthe familiar parameterisation of the background expansion\ninto w0 and wa . This is sufficient in describing and restricting the multitude of possible dark energy models and expansion histories. It is now common procedure to examine\ndata and convert it into constraints on various cosmological parameters including w0 and wa . We might therefore\nlike to extend this parameter space and allow for the additional signatures of gravity. One possible parameterisation for growth is given by \u03b3 in Equation (13) and was first\nintroduced by Peebles (1980) and Lahav et al. (1991) and\nlater discussed in Wang & Steinhardt (1998), Linder (2005),\nHuterer & Linder (2007) and Linder & Cahn (2007).\n\"Z a\n\"\n\u03b4\n\u2261 g(a) = exp\n(\u03a9m (a)\u03b3 \u2212 1) dlna\na\n0\n\n(13)\n\nBy once again looking at Figure 1 we can see that the\ngrowth factor g(a) is affected by the expansion history and\nby the gravitational framework. It is worth noting that the \u03b3\nparameterisation distinguishes the two contributions to the\ngrowth, encapsulating the latter in isolation. This is due to\nthe impact from the expansion being absorbed into \u03a9m (a)\nthus leaving \u03b3 to pick out any remaining remaining contribution. It is in this way that \u03b3 has become known as a\nmodified gravity or beyond-Einstein parameter. It is easy\nto see why given that it detects changes to the growth not\nassociated with expansion. This could be down to a change\nin the force law acting on matter represented, for example,\nby the extra factor in Equation (9). And as we alluded to\nearlier, evident in Figure 1, this allows us to distinguish between dark energy and modified gravity. However, as highlighted in Kunz & Sapone (2007) there exists an interesting caveat. They found that contrary to Figure 1 one could\nforce some arbitrary and generic dark energy to replicate\nthe growth of DGP. This was achieved by allowing for dark\nenergy models with lower sound speeds (c2s 6= 1) which in\nturn induce clustering in the fluid. The clustering instigates\na deepening of the gravitational potential wells thus leading\nto a magnification in the metric perturbations and subsequently an increase in the growth. In addition the existence\nof anisotropic stress was permitted which had the effect of\nsuppressing growth. With a careful balance between stress\nand sound speed they succeeded in replicating g(a) for DGP.\nNow although highly fine tuned it is worth keeping in mind\nthat observationally detecting some non-LCDM growth factor, or \u03b3, would therefore not necessarily constitute modi-\n\n1\n\n0.95\n\n0.9\n\n0.85\ng(a) \u2261 \u03b4(a)/a\n\n3\n\n0.8\n\n0.75\n\n0.7\n\n0.65\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nScale Factor (a)\nFigure 3. g(a) \u2261 \u03b4(a)/a, the linear growth, is plotted for various\nvalues of \u03b3 the parameterisation of growth resulting potentially\nfrom a change in force law. The solid line represents the growth\nfor the LCDM paradigm (w0 = \u22121, wa = 0) with the corresponding growth parameter of \u03b3 = 0.55. The dashed line shows\nthe growth for \u03b3 = 0.68 which is the same as resulting from flat\nDGP but with the same expansion as in LCDM. The dotted line\nalso has \u03b3 = 0.68 but now with w0 = \u22120.78 and wa = 0.32 thus\ncompletely specifying the growth of the example DGP model. Finally the dot-dashed line shows the growth for a LCDM expansion\nbut \u03b3 = 0.45. It is quite clear that a high value of the growth parameter corresponds to a suppression of growth. This potentially\narises from a weakening of gravity.\n\nfied gravity. In this way, unless one allows for only smooth\nnon-clustering dark energy the growth parameter is not just\na modified gravity parameter. Instead it has the ability to\npick up on clustered dark energy and modified gravity both\nof which would be interesting. Given the above it is therefore\nour intention to test the growth parameter and see whether\ncurrent data or a future probe can pick out this subtle but\npotentially important effect. Indeed there exists a few early\nattempts, including constraints from peculiar velocity measurements from low redshift Supernovae (Abate & Lahav\n2008) as well as future survey forecasts from Amendola et al.\n(2007), Huterer & Linder (2007) and Heavens et al. (2007).\nFigure 3 demonstrates the result of varying this parameter on the linear growth factor. The growth for standard\nLCDM corresponds to \u03b3 = 0.55 whereas for flat DGP it corresponds to \u03b3 = 0.68. In this way it is clear that a higher\ngrowth parameter results in a suppression of growth.\nIt is worthwhile noting that other attempts at parameterising modified gravity have been made which\naspire to encapsulate the properties of gravity similar to the Parameterised Post-Newtonian (PPN) parameters for local gravity constraints (Will 1993). For example, these include parameterising the relationship between the two metric potentials (\u03c6 and \u03c8) and/or quantifying any modification to the Poisson equation (E.g.\n\n\f6\n\nThomas et al.\n\nAmendola et al. (2007), Hu & Sawicki (2007), Ishak et al.\n(2006), Jain & Zhang (2007), Daniel et al. (2008) and\nBertschinger & Zukin (2008)). In fact these observations\nlead us on to the final modified gravity signature and characteristic we must consider before our analysis with weak lensing. For any deviation in the Poisson equation or between\nthe metric potentials causes a deviation in the relationship\nbetween the power spectrum of the potentials and the power\nspectrum of the density contrast. Failure to account for this\nby not modifying the corresponding lensing equations will\nrender any analysis incomplete. To understand this we use\nthe notation of Amendola et al. (2007) but in doing so note\nthe equivalence of their Q and \u03b7 (defined below) to G\u0303eff and\n\u03b7 given in the other thorough consideration by Jain & Zhang\n(2007).\nFirstly, as will be further detailed in the following section, let us notice that in weak lensing, our probe of choice,\nthe deflection of light is sensitive to the sum of the metric\npotentials \u03c6 + \u03c8. Therefore, we require the power spectrum\nwithin the lensing statistic (Equation (23)) to be the power\nspectrum of \u03c6 + \u03c8, written P(\u03c6+\u03c8) , which we then relate to\nthe matter power spectrum P\u03b4 . Defining the matter power\nspectrum in Equation (16) and the potential power spectrum\nsimilarly it is obvious that a general relationship between P\u03b4\nand P(\u03c6+\u03c8) relies on the relationship between \u03c6 + \u03c8 and \u03b4\nwhich in turn depends on the Poisson equation and the relationship between \u03c6 and \u03c8. This is where the parameters\nQ and \u03b7 (or equivalently G\u0303eff and \u03b7) are particularly useful. Here Q parameterises any modification in the Poisson\nequation relating the metric variable \u03c6 to the matter density \u03c1. \u03b7 on the other hand, also defined below, describes the\nrelationship between \u03c6 and \u03c8.\nk2 \u03c6 = \u22124\u03c0GQ\u03c1a2 \u03b4\n\n(14)\n\n\u03c8 \u2261 (1 + \u03b7)\u03c6\n\n(15)\n\nNow adding the two metric potentials together, substituting\n\u03c8 for \u03b7 and \u03c6 and transforming the combined Poisson equation, as given in the definition of the matter power spectrum\nbelow\n< \u03b4(k~1 , z)\u03b4(k~2 , z) >= (2\u03c0)3 \u03b4(k~1 + k~2 )P\u03b4 (k, z),\n\n(8\u03c0G)2 \u03c12 a4 [Q(1 + \u03b72 )]2 P\u03b4 (k, z)\n.\nk4\n\n(17)\n\nWe can, following the notation of Amendola et al.\n(2007), define \u03a3 \u2261 Q(1 + \u03b72 ), giving the modification to\nthe power spectrum more succinctly as,\n\nP(\u03c6+\u03c8) (k, z) =\n\n(8\u03c0G)2 \u03c12 a4 \u03a32 P\u03b4 (k, z)\n.\nk4\n\n\u03a3(a) = 1 + \u03a30 a.\n\n(18)\n\nIn a standard cosmological scenario, such as LCDM for\nexample, one will have \u03b7 = 0 and Q = 1 rendering \u03a3 = 1.\nThis results in the standard relation between the power spectra as often assumed in the literature. It is clear therefore\nthat neglecting \u03a3 is tantamount to constraining the subset\n\n(19)\n\nIt is our intention therefore to constrain and forecast\nfor the specific mDGP gravity model and then, separately,\nconstrain the general characteristics of modified gravity. For\nthe latter we choose to set \u03a3 = 1 (or \u03a30 = 0) due to limitations in data and constrain w0 and \u03b3 signatures only. We\nlater include \u03a30 6= 0 for the Euclid forecasts. It is worthwhile\nnoting that \u03b3 and \u03a3 are functions of the more fundamental\nQ and \u03b7 and that these parameters themselves are, most\ngenerally, Q(k, a) and \u03b7(k, a) (Amendola et al. 2007).\n\n4\n\nWEAK LENSING AS A COSMOLOGICAL\nPROBE\n\nThe deflection of light by mass is given by the transverse\ngradient of the metric potentials integrated along the path\nlength,\n\u03c6=\u2212\n\nZ\n\n\u2202(\u03c8 + \u03c6)ds.\n\n(20)\n\nThis acts to not only change the apparent position of some\npoint source but, in turn, distort the shape of distant source\ngalaxies. Indeed, one can relate the observed position of the\nimage \u03b8~I to the true position of the source \u03b8~S , in the plane\nof the sky, by\nD(\u03c7s \u2212 \u03c7)\n\u03b8~I = ~\n\u03b8S +\n\u03c6\n~,\nD(\u03c7)\n\n(16)\n\nand similarly for the potential, it is possible to see the general relationship between the power spectra,\n\nP(\u03c6+\u03c8) (k, z) =\n\nof modified gravity models that do not alter the power spectrum relation from the General Relativistic case. Surprisingly the mDGP model studied earlier is one such model.\nThis can be seen by simply adding Equations (6) and (7)\ntogether and observing the cancellation in \u03b2. Therefore, for\nthis model \u03a3 = 1 also and as a result just the expansion\nhistory and growth will be altered. Generally however if one\nstrives to include general models \u03a3 should be allowed to\nvary. Note that it acts to modify the amplitude of the power\nspectrum and so a constant value is degenerate with \u03c38 .\nAccordingly, as introduced in Amendola et al. (2007), we\nconsider the general parameterisation given by,\n\n(21)\n\nwhere D(\u03c7) is given by the comoving angular diameter distance. The subsequent image distortion is given by the differential of this lens equation resulting in the Jacobian\n\u201e\n\u00ab\n~\n1 \u2212 \u03ba \u2212 \u03b31\n\u03b32\n~ = d \u03b8S =\n,\nA\n\u03b32\n1 \u2212 \u03ba + \u03b31\nd~\n\u03b8I\nwhere the convergence \u03ba is reconstructed from the shear \u03b3\n(where \u03b3 = \u03b31 + i\u03b32 ) which in turn is measured from galactic ellipticities (Refregier 2003). From the point of view of\na cosmological model it is the convergence that we are interested in. This convergence, which represents a weighted\nprojected mass distribution on the plane of the sky, is given\n(Bartelmann & Schneider 2001) for a general mass distribution by\n3\u03a9m H02\n\u03ba=\n2c2\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03c7s\n\nd\u03c7\n\nD(\u03c7)D(\u03c7s \u2212 \u03c7)\n(1 + z)\u03b4(\u03c7).\n\u03c7s\n\n(22)\n\n\fWeak Lensing and Modified Gravity\nGiven that we wish to analyse this distribution in a statistical way we use the defintion of the power spectrum analogous to Equation (16) - to find the expression for the\nconvergence power spectrum\n9\u03a92m H04\nP\u03ba (l) =\n4c4\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03c7H\n\nd\u03c7\n\nh g(\u03c7) i2\na(\u03c7)\n\nP\u03b4\n\n\"l\n\n\u03c7\n\n\"\n,\u03c7 ,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere the geometric comoving angular diameter distance\nterms have been absorbed into g(\u03c7). It is therefore now clear,\ngiven our earlier discussion, how weak lensing as a cosmological probe is particularly useful in studies of modified gravity.\nFor this statistic is sensitive to the growth of structure via\nthe presence of the linear growth factor squared (g 2 (a)) in\nthe matter power spectrum P\u03b4 . It is sensitive to the expansion history through the terms in the square brackets and\nthrough the Hubble drag in the growth of structure and also,\nas discussed at the end of the last section, it is sensitive to\nthe relation between the power spectrum of the potentials\nand density. In the equation above the relation from P\u03c6+\u03c8 to\nP\u03b4 has already been performed assuming GR as given routinely in the literature. Again, it is worth reiterating that\nif there is a modification to the Poisson equation and/or\nto the anisotropic stress one must augment this powerspectrum with the approapriate prefactor given, for example, as\nin Equation (17). In addition to these sensitivities it is worth\nadding that because the deflection is given by the potentials,\nwhich are sourced by mass irrespective of being baryonic or\ndark, weak lensing does not suffer from any unknown bias.\nThat is, it probes the entirety of the mass distribution.\nWhile this probe, in principle, is excellent for our\nchosen study it is worthwhile noting that the shear signal is a small 1% distortion on the already existing intrinsic ellipticity. This provides a thorough technical challenge that is being combated with a combination of large\ngalaxy number analyses and refined shear measurement\ntechniques (Heymans et al. (2006), Massey et al. (2007)\nand Bridle et al. (2008)). Further still, the first detections of weak lensing are particularly recent (Bacon et al.\n(2000), Kaiser et al. (2000), Wittman et al. (2000) and\nvan Waerbeke et al. (2000)) and so in this way lensing is\nvery much a highly promising, yet developing, cosmological\nprobe. Despite this there are already a number of papers\nin the literature that have addressed the relationship between weak lensing and modified gravity or dark energy,\nsuch as Uzan & Bernardeau (2001), Schimd et al. (2005),\nDor\u00e9 et al. (2007), Schimd et al. (2007), Amendola et al.\n(2007), Jain & Zhang (2007) and Tsujikawa & Tatekawa\n(2008). With these studies and potential modified gravity\nattributes in lensing it is imperitive to realise that there\ndoes exist a severe caveat. This is due to the fact that lensing probes into the non-linear regime. We are fortunate to\nbe able to use a fitting function (E.g. Smith et al. 2003) for\nthe non-linearities in standard gravity. Unfortunately this is\npoorly understood in any deviation from the current framework and subsequent implementation of the fit would, technically, be invalid. Therefore until N-body simulations have\nbeen undertaken that could generalise the fitting function or\naccurately quantify deviations from it we must strive to work\nin the linear regime as much as possible. Although some attempts have been made at quantifying the validity of the\npresent fits (E.g. Laszlo & Bean (2008) and Oyaizu et al.\n\n7\n\n(2008)) we keep, for now, a strict and linear only analysis.\nThere are, in addition, other benefits in avoiding the inclusion of small scales such as the presence of intrinsic ellipticity correlations, shear-shape correlations and the presence of\nnon-Gaussianity in the error. We therefore utilise the data\nprovided by F08 based on the CFHTLS-wide survey which,\ndue to its range of large angular scales (up to 230 arcminutes) probing the more linear regime, is ideal for work on\nnon-LCDM cosmology such as this.\n\n4.1\n\nCFHTLS\n\nThe Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey 4\n(CFHTLS), based on the MEGAPRIME/MEGACAM instrument, is an ongoing survey with a target of 450 nights extending over 5 years. The recent analysis by Benjamin et al.\n(2007) has gone beyond the initial releases and investigations by Semboloni et al. (2006) and Hoekstra et al. (2006)\nwhich themselves were successful in deriving constraints\non the \u03a9m \u2212 \u03c38 degeneracy and demonstrating the evolution of the shear signal with redshift. This was achieved\nin Benjamin et al. (2007) through a better understanding of\nthe redshift distribution and having an increased area. This,\nwhile marking significant progress, is still not the most optimal lensing analysis for this work. This is because they\nare potentially sensitive to the growth of structures on nonlinear scales which, as we emphasised above, is undesirable\nfor a current study of beyond-Einstein cosmology and weak\nlensing. We therefore look to the 3rd year CFHTLS-wide\nrelease (T0003) given by Fu et al. (2008) (F08). Although\nhaving a smaller field of view than Benjamin et al. (2007) it\nutilises much larger angular scales (into the linear regime)\nalso avoiding many of the potential systematics mentioned\nat the end of the last section. It is because of this that\nboth works reveal approximately equivalent cosmological\nconstraints and little constraining power is lost.\nThe current sky coverage of 57deg2 , approximately 35%\nof the final CFHTLS target area, is reduced to 34.2deg2 after masking and the removal of various contaminants. Eventually including five bands this i\u2032 band study stretches to\na magnitude of i\u2032AB = 24.5 and encapsulating nearly 1.7\nmillion galaxies has an effective galaxy number density of\nn = 13.3gal/arcmin2 . The data (F08) comes in the form\nof several two point statistics which are relevant to this\nstudy. We choose to utilise the E correlation function which\nis shown in Equation (24) and displayed along with the cosmological best fit in Figure 4.\n\u03beE =\n\n1\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nlP\u03ba (l)J0 (l\u03b8) dl\n\n(24)\n\n0\n\n2\nAs for the aperture mass < Map\n> and shear top hat\nvariance < |\u03b3|2 > two point statistics this is a weighted\ntransform of the convergence power spectrum. In this case\nit is given by a zeroth order Bessel function of the first kind\nJ0 . It is in this way that the two point functions vary in their\nsensitivity to various aspects of the power spectrum and in\nturn any systematics. \u03beE suffers from a constant offset resulting from a mixing of E and B-modes. A finite survey\n\n4\n\nhttp:/www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Science/CFHTLS/\n\n\f8\n\nThomas et al.\n\nsize introduces a maximum angular scale which prevents a\ncomplete calculation of the shear correlation function over\nlarger ranges. This is needed for a separation of E and B\n(Kilbinger et al. 2006). To alleviate this we alter the statistic \u03beE to \u03beE + c\u2032 including the constant offset c\u2032 as an extra parameter. An expression is then obtained for the offset\nwhich represents the best fit offset (d\u03c72 /dc\u2032 = 0) for each\nparameter choice. This constitutes an analytic marginalisation over c\u2032 (Lewis & Bridle 2002). We subsequently find the\nexpression to be\n\n14\n\nx 10\n\n\u22125\n\nData\nBest Fit\n\n12\n10\n\nc\u2032 =\n\nX\ni,j\n\n\u03be\n\nE\n\n8\n\n(C \u22121 )ij (\u03bei \u2212 Di )\nX \u22121\n(C )ij\n\n,\n\n(25)\n\n6\n4\n\ni,j\n\nwhere the element \u03bei is the model correlation function, Di\nthe data and C the full covariance matrix between all the\nelements. Furthermore, the B correlation function \u03beB which\ndescribes the curl component of the shear field, as opposed to\n\u03beE which measures the curl-free component, is expected to\nbe non-zero only for non-lensing contributions to the shear\n(Crittenden et al. 2002). It is because of this that \u03beB is an\nexcellent check on any contamination of the lensing signal.\nF08 found no real B-mode contribution except for the presence of a very small signal at large angular scales. They find\nhowever that their cosmological conclusions are not affected\nby this potential mode. In addition, it was shown in F08\nthat there was no significant deviation in cosmological constraints across any of the aforementioned two point statistics. Dor\u00e9 et al. (2007), who also looked at modified gravity\nmodels in the context of this CFHTLS-wide data, came to a\nsimilar conclusion. It is worth noting that other cosmological\nstudies of this data set include a phenomenological modified\ngravity analysis (Daniel et al. 2008) and more recently an\nearly study of the neutrino mass (Tereno et al. 2008). We\ntherefore choose for simply to use only one statistic (\u03beE ).\nThe redshift distribution of the source galaxies, which\nweak lensing is critically sensitive to, has been calibrated\nfor the CFHTLS study using Ilbert et al. (2006). We decide\nto follow F08 and model this redshift distribution using the\nfunction\n\" Z zmax z a + z ab \"\u22121\nz a + z ab\nn(z) = A b\n,\nwhere A =\ndz\nz +c\nzb + c\n0\n(26)\nwhere A is the normalisation and a, b and c are three extra parameters to be varied and marginalised over in the\ncosmological fit. They found that Equation (26) enables a\ncloser fit to the distribution data that other common n(z)\nfitting formulae. The observed normalised redshift distribution, along with the fitting function evaluated at the best fit\npoints found in the mDGP combined probes cosmological\nrun (Section 5.2), is shown in Figure 5.\n\n5\n5.1\n\n2\n0\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n10\n\n\u03b8 (arcminutes)\n\n2\n\n10\n\nFigure 4. The open circles with associated errorbars represent\nthe \u03beE two-point statistic as a function of \u03b8 (arcminutes) for the\nCFHTLS-wide survey used in this paper. We however selectively\nuse scales greater than 30 arcminutes to remove the unknown\nnon-linear effects and in doing so strive towards a more linear\nanalysis. The red dashed line shows the best fit values as found\nwith the combined probes mDGP analysis (Section 5.2).\n\nout these particular behaviours with weak lensing, we are\nnow in a position to make cosmological constraints based on\nthe data which we decided, in Section 4.1, was the most suitable. That is, we start by making an analysis of the mDGP\ngravitational model and then separately the parameterisation of growth with the F08 CFHTLS-wide lensing data.\nWe perform a full likelihood analysis using a Monte\nCarlo Markov Chain (MCMC) approach on a set of 7 cosmological parameters for the mDGP analysis and 8 for the\ngrowth parameterisation analysis. We vary \u03a9m , h, \u03c38 , a,\nb, c which are common to both models, in addition to \u03b1\nfor mDGP and w0 and \u03b3 for the growth. The w0 is not\nincluded for the former model as any given \u03b1 uniquely specifies its own expansion history as it does for the evolution of\nperturbations\u2013from GR to DGP. We decide not to vary the\nspectral index ns because the data needed at large angular\nseparations will be insufficient for any constraint. Instead\nwe set it to ns = 0.963 consistent with the best fit five-year\nWMAP result (Dunkley et al. 2008). Likewise we neglect\nvarying wa and \u03a30 for the growth model due to limitations\nin the data. Instead we set them to wa = 0 and \u03a30 = 0.\nFinally, we assume a flat universe throughout.\nFor the lensing analysis the Gaussian log-likelihood is\ngiven by\n\nCONSTRAINTS\nLensing\n\nHaving earlier discussed the characteristics of certain latetime acceleration models in Section 2 and Section 3, and\nhaving chosen a probe that is potentially capable of picking\n\n\u03c72 =\n\n1X\n(Di \u2212 Ti )(C \u22121 )ij (Dj \u2212 Tj ),\n2 ij\n\n(27)\n\n~ is given by the measured \u03beE (\u03b8i ).\nwhere the data vector D\nThe theoretical prediction deduced at the corresponding an-\n\n\fWeak Lensing and Modified Gravity\n\n0.9\n\nn(z)\nBest fit\n\n1\n\n9\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n0.6\n\n\u03b1\n\nNormalised Redshift Distribution\n\n0.8\n\n0.5\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n0.2\n\n0.2\n0.1\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nRedshift (z)\nFigure 5. The black dashed line represents the source redshift\ndistribution with associated errors in the bins. The red solid line\nis given by the fitting function in Equation (26). The fit is drawn\nfor the function evaluated at the best-fit points as deduced by\nthe combined probes analysis for mDGP (Section 5.2). This corresponded to best fit values: a = 0.614 \u00b1 0.034, b = 8.11 \u00b1 0.681,\nc = 0.627 \u00b1 0.0610 and A = 0.6462 consistent with F08.\n\ngular scale \u03b8 is represented by entries in T~ and, finally, C \u22121\nis the inverse covariance matrix for the chosen observable.\nAt present variation in either a, b or c in the redshift distribution is detected implicitely through the alteration of\nthe model matter power spectrum. However, in implementing the MCMC approach regions of parameter space could\npotentially be sampled that would correspond to configurations of a, b and c incompatible with just the knowledge\nof the redshift distribution alone. We therefore follow the\nprocedure in F08 and multiply the likelihood above by the\nlikelihood of the redshift distribution given by\n\u03c72n(z) =\n\n1 X (ni \u2212 n(zi ))2\n,\n2 i\n\u03c3i2\n\n(28)\n\nwhere ni , the observed number of galaxies in a bin, are\nshown in Figure 5. n(zi ) represent the values of the fitting function in Equation (26) evaluated at the bin centred redshifts. While ignoring cross-correlations in the bins\nwe include \u03c3i which is the error in ni . This error includes\nPoisson noise, sample variance and the associated redshift\nuncertainty. In addition to the redshift distribution we also\ninclude an HST prior (Freedman et al. 2001) on h as given\nby,\n\u03c72HST =\n\n1 (h \u2212 0.72)2\n.\n2\n0.082\n\n(29)\n\nFor the lensing only analysis we cut the data such that\nwe use angular scales greater than 30 arcminutes, which we\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n\u03a9m\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\nFigure 6. The diagram above demonstrates the attempted constraint on a parameterised gravitational model that is motivated\nby the concept of a large extra dimension (mDGP). The contours\nare for \u03a9m , the matter density, and \u03b1 the modified gravity parameter where 5 other cosmological parameters (h, \u03c38 , a, b and c)\nhave been marginalised. Here only angular scales greater than 30\narcminutes have been used in order to avoid the non-linear regime.\nThe selection of data is from the CFHTLS-wide (F08) survey with\nanalysis using the E correlation two point statistic \u03beE + c\u2032 . Note\nthat for this mDGP model \u03b1 = 0 corresponds to LCDM whereas\n\u03b1 = 1 is equivalent to the DGP braneworld model.\n\nreiterate, is to avoid the unknown non-linear contribution\nto the lensing constraint. The analysis for the mDGP model\nis shown in Figure 6. It shows the marginalised \u03a9m and\n\u03b1 contours where, as shown in Section 2, \u03b1 parameterises\na gravitational model with a large extra dimension. The\nmDGP model interpolates between LCDM (\u03b1 = 0) and the\nDGP braneworld model (\u03b1 = 1). It is clear therefore that a\nlensing only analysis is presently not capable of constraining mDGP\u2013at least in the context of physically more viable\nmodels (\u03b1 . 1). Indeed we find a similar difficulty in \u03b3 with\nno constraint on any reasonable physical values in a lensing\nonly analysis. Firstly, we should perhaps not be too surprised as we have used a relatively new cosmological probe\nand have, in neglecting the non-linear scales, used only a\nthird of the data points. Tomographic information is not\nyet currently available for this data either which will vastly\nimprove information on the expansion history and hence \u03b1.\nWe have also allowed significant cosmological freedom with\nthe variation of 7 parameters. On the other hand, however,\nthis does not mean that lensing, even with a current analysis, is not useful with regards to our late-time acceleration\nmodels. In order to see the current effectiveness we now look\nat Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Supernovae and lensing in\ncombination in the next section. Then in Section 6 we see\nhow the future weak lensing survey Euclid will improve upon\ntoday's lensing only constraining power.\n\n\f10\n5.2\n\nThomas et al.\nSupernovae and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations\n\nIn the previous section we performed a preliminary analysis\nbased on linear to quasi-linear weak lensing data alone. This\nprobe, while having characteristics significant for the discrimation of late time acceleration, was unable to constrain\neither the mDGP model or the growth parameterisation.\nAs such it is desirable for us to combine it with other cosmological probes in order to improve potential constraints.\nMoreover, it is most beneficial to combine weak lensing, an\nindicator of growth and expansion, with distance indicators.\nThis is because of the particular degeneracies that exist between the parameters following an isolated study of lensing.\nFor example, there exists a degeneracy between w and \u03b3\nand so tighter constraints on the expansion history will act\nto aid any constraint on \u03b3. Furthermore, inclusion of additional expansion data will aid the constraints of the mDGP\nmodel given that different \u03b1 corresponds to different late\ntime accelerations. We therefore choose to include both Supernovae and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) which,\ndue to their vastly different \u03a9m \u2212 w degeneracies, are also\nextremely complementary to one another.\nBAOs, used as standard rulers and observed in the\ngalaxy distribution, aim to test cosmology through the\ndistance-redshift relation. Using the data and notation of\nPercival et al. (2007) we look to utilise the distance measure given by\n1\n\n2\nDV (z) = [(1 + z)2 DA\ncz/H(z)] 3 ,\n\n(30)\n\nwhere DA is the angular diameter distance and H(z) is the\nHubble parameter. Specifically, it is the ratio rs /DV (z) that\nwe examine where rs is the comoving sound horizon at recombination. Percival et al. (2007) detects the BAO in the\nclustering of 2dFGRS and SDSS galaxy samples and the\nclustering of SDSS LRGs to quantify this measure at z = 0.2\nand z = 0.35, respectively. For each likelihood evaluation we\ncompare this data to rs /DV (z) calculated with DV (z) from\nEquation (30) and the comoving sound horizon rs evaluated\nusing the formulae in Eisenstein & Hu (1998).\nFor the inclusion of Supernovae we use the data provided from the first year Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS)\n(Astier et al. 2006). This data set includes 71 type 1a Supernovae also detected at the Canda-France-Hawaii Telescope.\nHere we use the distance modulus \u03bc0 , a measure of the luminosity distance, as the observable.\n\u03bc0 = 5log10(dL (z)) + 25.\n\n(31)\n\nThis is given in the log-likelihood (Equation (32)) also as \u03bc0 ,\nwhere \u03bcB is the observed value. \u03c3int is given by the intrinsic\ndispersion of the absolute magnitudes and \u03c3(\u03bcB ) by peculiar\nvelocity and light curve parameter information.\n\n\u03c72 =\n\nX (\u03bcB \u2212 5log (dL (\u03b8, z)) \u2212 25)2\n10\n2 (\u03bc ) + \u03c3 2\n\u03c3\nB\nint\nobjects\n\n(32)\n\nWith this machinery in place we are now able to perform\nadditional tests on the mDGP model. We do not constrain\nthe growth parameterisation with these probes in isolation\nas in this format they have no growth information. We do,\n\nhowever, attempt to constrain the growth with a combined\nanalysis at the end of this section.\nBy looking at the top left hand panel of Figure 7\nwe can see that it is possible to place a constraint on \u03b1\nwith a BAO only analysis. It should be noted that the apparent disfavouring of DGP (\u03b1 = 1) is not as promising\nas it first appears for we have, replicating the analysis of\nYamamoto et al. (2006) with BAO only, varied just \u03a9m and\n\u03b1 with \u03a9b and h held fixed at 0.044 and 0.66, respectively.\nThe top right hand panel of the same Figure demonstrates\nthe need for caution as we go beyond the Yamamoto et al.\n(2006) analysis. By allowing more cosmological freedom (i.e.\nvarying \u03a9b and h) and including the Supernovae data the\ntwo probes are in fact incapable of disfavouring DGP. We\ncan now see how, even at present, the weak lensing data is\nuseful for the study of this modified gravity. The \u03a9m \u2212 \u03b1\ncontours for a joint analysis with all three combined probes\nis displayed in the bottom left hand panel. Once again we\nuse only angular scales greater than 30 arcminutes to avoid\nthe unknown non-linear regime. For the combined analysis\nit is worth noting that we vary a significant total of 8 cosmological parameters: \u03a9m , h, \u03c38 , \u03a9b , a, b, c and \u03b1. It is\nnow evident that the addition of the weak lensing analysis\nis beneficial with a mild disfavouring of the DGP end of the\n\u03b1 spectrum. Indeed, we include in the bottom right hand\npanel the 1D probability distribution for \u03b1, in the process\ndemonstrating that \u03b1 < 0.58 at the 68% confidence level and\n\u03b1 < 0.91 at the 95% confidence level. This corresponds to\na disfavouring of DGP at over 2\u03c3. Furthermore, we include\nin the left panel of Figure 8, for interest, the same analysis but with all angular scales (1-230 arcminutes). There\nis a noticeable but not significant improvement in the constraint on mDGP. The slight increase in disfavouring leads\nto \u03b1 < 0.56 and \u03b1 < 0.86 at the 68% and 95% confidence\nlevels, respectively. Again to reiterate it should be noted\nthat this analysis, in using all angular scales, ventures into\nthe non-linear regime.\nHaving had some success with a combination of the\nthree cosmological probes it is worth investigating whether\nthey can aid the determination of the far more subtle growth\nparameterisation \u03b3. While the BAO and Supernova will not\nadd growth information explicitely they may help reduce\nthe parameter degeneracies and cut the parameter space\nfavourably. We find however, by looking at the right panel\nof Figure 8, that at present and for meaningful values of\n\u03b3 we still have insufficient constraining power. This is understandable given that for the mDGP model \u03b1 contained\ngrowth and expansion information. In this way the Supernovae and the BAO actively contributed to the constraint\nwhile the lensing constrained it through the comoving diameter distances D(\u03c7) in the convergence power spectrum,\nthrough expansion terms within the growth via the Hubble drag and finally through the pure growth contribution\nas seen in the \u03b2 contribution. Constraining \u03b3 on the other\nhand is equivalent to just changes in \u03b2 and is therefore far\nsubtler. However, just because we do not have the current\ndata to pick out this effect it should not deter us from pursuing this potential signature of modified gravity. In fact,\nfuture cosmological probes, such as weak lensing, may well\nbe able to extract this contribution and tighten constraints\non beyond-Einstein cosmology. We look to the future in Section 6.\n\n\f0.9\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\nWeak Lensing and Modified Gravity\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n\u03a9\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\n0.45\n\n0.15\n\n\u03a9\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n11\n\n0.35\n\nm\n\nm\n\n1\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\nProbability\n\n0.7\n\n\u03b1\n\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n0.1\n0.16\n\n0.18\n\n0.2\n\n0.22\n\n0.24\n\n\u03a9\n\n0.26\n\n0.28\n\n0.3\n\n0.32\n\nm\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n\u03b1\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\nFigure 7. The plot in the top left panel shows the constraint on \u03a9m and \u03b1. Although appearing to disfavour DGP (\u03b1 = 1) as in the\nanalysis by Yamamoto et al. (2006) the remaining parameters \u03a9b and h0 have been fixed at 0.044 and 0.66 respectively. We go beyond\nthis in the top right panel which contains constraints given on the same parameters but when Supernovae data is added and \u03a9b and h0\nare allowed to vary. We see now that the 1\u03c3 contour is beyond the bounds of the plot and so no constraint can be inferred. The benefit\nof the weak lensing data is seen in the bottom left panel where once again we use angular scales greater than 30 arcminutes from the\nCFHTLS-wide (F08) lensing survey. We also vary \u03a9m , h, \u03c38 , \u03a9b , a, b, c and \u03b1 whilst keeping ns = 0.963. With this addition it is evident\nthat there is a visible improvement in constraint and that DGP is marginally disfavoured. This is exemplified in the bottom right panel\nwhere we include the 1D marginalised probability distribution (solid line). We find that the joint analysis gives constraints on mDGP of\n\u03b1 < 0.58 and \u03b1 < 0.91 at the 68% and 95% confidence levels, respectively. The dotted line represents the mean likelihood of the samples.\nFinally, the dashed contours in the bottom left hand panel show that our constraints are roughly insensitive to any systematics in the\ndata such as an over or underestimation of the shear at high redshift (Section 5.3).\n\n5.3\n\nAccounting for systematics\n\nDespite the absence of any significant B-modes in the\nCFHTLS data there exists a potential underestimation of\nthe shear at high redshift (Kilbinger et al. in prep.). In order to account for this potential effect we use the model\nintroduced in Kilbinger et al. and multiply the redshift distribution at high redshift (z > 1) by some constant c0 \u2013where\nc0 < 1 constitutes underestimation, c0 > 1 overestimation\nand c0 = 1 no alteration in the shear. Following the aforementioned paper we vary c0 and marginalise over the parameter in an additional cosmological run, thus accounting\nfor any such systematic. We subsequently find little change\n\nin the constraint on mDGP as shown by the dashed contour\nin the bottom left hand panel of Figure 7. Indeed the 68%\nconfidence interval is only shifted from \u03b1 < 0.58 to \u03b1 < 0.61\nwith systematic treatment. Moreover, with the cut in angular scales at \u03b8 = 30 arcminutes it has not been possible\nto meaningfully constrain c0 itself. Further treatment and\ncauses of potential systematics in the data are detailed in\nvan Waerbeke et al. in prep. and Kilbinger et al. in prep.\n\n\f12\n\nThomas et al.\n\n0.9\n\n2\n\n0.8\n\n1.8\n\n0.7\n\n1.6\n1.4\n\n\u03b3\n\n\u03b1\n\n0.6\n0.5\n\n1.2\n1\n\n0.4\n0.8\n0.3\n0.6\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n0.18\n\n0.2\n\n0.22\n\n0.24\n\n\u03a9\n\n0.26\n\n0.28\n\n0.3\n\n0.32\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\nm\n\n\u03a9\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\nm\n\nFigure 8. The left panel is an analysis of the mDGP model with weak lensing, BAO and Supernovae, as before, but in this case with the\nfull range of angular scales (1-230 arcminutes). There is a slight, but not significant, improvement than in the more linear analysis. Here\nwe find \u03b1 < 0.56 and \u03b1 < 0.86 at the 68% and 95% confidence levels, respectively. It should be noted that this analysis includes data\nfrom the unknown non-linear regime however. The right panel demonstrates the current challenge in constraining the gravitational\u2013as\nopposed to the expansion\u2013contribution to the growth of structure. We find that with current data we are unable to put any bounds on\nreasonable values of the \u03b3 parameter. This plot contains an analysis with weak lensing, Supernovae and BAOs. Implicit in this plot is\nthe variation of also h, \u03c38 , \u03a9b , a, b, c and w0 . Only angular scales greater than 30 arcminutes have been used.\n\n6\n\nFUTURE PROBES - EUCLID\n\nWithin the foreseeable future the age of precision cosmology looks likely to get ever more precise. The field of weak\nlensing is most definitely no exception and it is perhaps set\nto be one of the most promising areas of development. One\nstriking reason, among others, is the planned Euclid mission (Refregier et al. (2008) and Cimatti et al. (2008)). This\nspace based project aims to have an effective sky coverage of\n20000 square degrees, probing the galaxy distribution with\na median redshift zm = 0.9 and giving an effective galaxy\ndensity of 40 gal/arcmin2 . Hence it is of great interest to\nsee how this future survey will probe the nature of gravity,\nwhatever that may be. We therefore undertake a Fisher matrix analysis with the intention of forecasting, with lensing\nonly, how Euclid will be able to constrain the mDGP model\n(\u03b1) as well as the general parameterisation for gravity (\u03b3\nand \u03a3). The Fisher matrix formalism for weak lensing is\ngiven by\n\nFij =\n\nX \u2202C\n\u2202C\nCov \u22121\n,\n\u2202p\n\u2202p\ni\nj\nl\n\n(33)\n\nwhere C is the weak lensing observable shown by\n2\nCij (l) = Pijk + < \u03b3int\n> \u03b4ij /n \u0304i ,\n\nPijk\n\n(34)\n\nand\nis the power spectrum similar to Equation (23) but\nwith indices i and j denoting tomographic bins. Further still,\nn\u0304i is the average galaxy number per steradian in bin i and\n1\n2\n< \u03b3int\n> 2 is the rms intrinsic shear in each component, which\nis equal here to 0.22. \u2202pi denotes the derivative with respect\n\nto a parameter p that is varied and Cov is the covariance\nmatrix given by,\n\u03b4ll\u2032\nk\nk\nk\n[Cik\n(l)Cjl\n(l)+Cilk (l)Cjk\n(l)].\n(2l + 1)fsky \u2206l\n(35)\nFor our analysis we assume the redshift distribution\ngiven in Equation (36) where z0 = zm /1.412, \u03b1 = 2 and\n\u03b2 = 1.5. We allow for five redshift bins with divisions such\nas to give approximately equal galaxy number in each bin.\nThe photometric error is also accounted for by using the\nparameterisation \u03c3z = \u03c3p (1 + z), with \u03c3p taken to be 0.03.\n\nk\nk \u2032\nCov[Cij\n(l), Ckl\n(l )] =\n\nn(z) \u221d z \u03b1 exp(\u2212(z/z0 )\u03b2 )\n\n(36)\n\nFor the base cosmology we vary, about their fiducial values, the parameters \u03a9m = 0.3, h = 0.7, \u03c38 = 0.8, \u03a9b = 0.05\nand ns = 1.0, which are common to both analyses, with also\nw0 = \u22121.0, wa = 0.0, \u03b3 = 0.55 and \u03a30 = 0 (see Section 3)\nfor the general parameterisation, and \u03b1 = 0 for the mDGP\nmodel. We therefore vary a full 9 parameters for the general\nmodifed gravity parameterisation and 6 parameters for the\nspecific braneworld model\u2013remembering that \u03b1 specifies its\nown w0 , wa , \u03b3 and \u03a30 = 0.\nThe resulting forecasts for this future project can be\nseen clearly in Figure 9. The left panel shows that Euclid\nwill be able to put considerable strain on any braneworldlike gravity scenario that resembles the mDGP model. The\nsolid (1\u03c3) and dashed (2\u03c3) contours are significantly within\nthe \u03b1 = 1, or DGP, bound. In fact, this demonstrates that\nEuclid will potentially constrain \u03b1 to within an error of 0.104\n\n\fWeak Lensing and Modified Gravity\n\n7\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\n\nTo summarise, we have noted that the surprising, but well\nconfirmed, late-time acceleration of the universe could be\nthe result of a modification to gravity. We then, in Section 2, reviewed the concept of modified gravity detailing\nin the process a model that is motivated and acts to parameterise a large extra dimension (mDGP). Interpolating between LCDM (\u03b1 = 0) and DGP (\u03b1 = 1) it can be tested as a\nmodel in its own right and/or used as an example to demonstrate the rich set of observational signatures that are likely\nto arise for a modified gravity model in cosmology. These\nsignatures include the expansion history, and rather interestingly, the growth of structure and a modification to the\nrelationship between the potential power spectrum and the\nmatter power spectrum. With these characteristics in mind\nwe then discussed attempts in the literature to parameterise\nmodified gravity in this way. This included a growth parameter \u03b3 and a power spectrum parameter \u03a3.\nIn Section 4 we introduced weak lensing and related\nits attributes to modified gravity given that it is sensitive to\nthe expansion history, the growth of structure and the power\nspectrum. We noted a severe caveat in the use of non-linear\nscales and therefore, in Section 4.1, described the approapriate choice of survey (CFHTLS-wide) and data (\u03b8 > 30 ar-\n\nl (max) = 10000\nl (max) = 500\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n\u03a3\n\nat the 68% confidence level. This is in constrast to Figure 6\nwhere no constraint was possible with a lensing-only study.\nIndeed, note that for this analysis only contributions from\nl = 10 to lmax = 500 were considered such that the deeply\nnon-linear regime could be neglected.\nThe right panel in Figure 9 again illustrates the expected constraining power of Euclid but now with regards to\ngeneral modified gravity. For this general parameterisation\nwe performed two runs with one corresponding to l contributions from l = 10 to lmax = 500 (red contours) and the\nother with contributions from l = 10 to lmax = 10000 (black\ncontours). Here we see that Euclid will be able to extract\nthe growth characteristic thus allowing, potentially, a strong\ncosmological test of our gravitational framework. Indeed, it\nwill be able to constrain the fiducial \u03b3 = 0.55 (LCDM) to\nwithin an error of 0.0446 at 1\u03c3 with lmax = 500 which is\nfurther tightened to 0.038 with lmax = 10000. The other 7\ncosmological parameters (h, \u03c38 , \u03a9b , w0 , wa , ns and \u03a30 ) have\nbeen varied and marginalised over. Again this forecast is in\ncontrast to Figure 8 where even the combined probes of lensing, BAOs and Supernovae were incapable of constraining\nthe growth.\nFinally, we include in Figure 10 a marginalised contour for \u03b3 against \u03a30 which further highlights how modified\ngravity or very generic dark energy signatures can be constrained, consistently, with weak lensing. We find that with\nlmax = 500 (red contours) this survey could constrain alterations in the powerspectrum with an error in \u03a30 of 0.25 at\n1\u03c3. This parameter is more sensitive to the range of scales\nused than \u03b3, however, with lmax = 10000 (black contours)\nconfining \u03a30 to within 0.069 of the fiducial value \u03a30 = 0.\nWe should emphasise that the spectroscopic element of\nEuclid (Cimatti et al. 2008) will also be able to constrain\ngrowth via redshift space distortions (Peacock et al. (2002)\nand Guzzo et al. (2008)).\n\n13\n\n0\n\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\n\u22120.6\n\u22120.8\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\n0.45\n\n0.5\n\n0.55\n\n\u03b3\n\n0.6\n\n0.65\n\n0.7\n\n0.75\n\n0.8\n\nFigure 10. The above plot shows the marginalised \u03b3\u2212\u03a30 forecast\nfor a weak lensing only analysis with Euclid. These two parameters, which could represent modified gravity or generic dark energy signatures, demonstrate how this future weak lensing probe\nwill potentially place firm constrains on any model of late-time\nacceleration. The black contours correspond to lmax = 10000,\ndemonstrating an error of 0.069(1\u03c3) on \u03a30 , whereas the red contours correspond to lmax = 500 giving instead an error of 0.25. In\nboth cases the inner and outer contours are 1\u03c3 and 2\u03c3, respectively.\n\ncminutes) used in the cosmological analyses. The subsequent\nlensing only constraints were given in Section 5.1 where we\nshowed that one could not yet constrain meaningful values\nof \u03b1 or \u03b3 with the current data. We then, by adding it to\nBaryon Acoustic Oscillation and Supernovae data, demonstrated that weak lensing was highly beneficial in aiding the\nconstraint of mDGP in combination. For without the inclusion of the lensing data the expansion-only probes were\nincapable of constraining \u03b1 = 1. We found however that the\ncombined probes disfavoured the DGP model with over a\n95% confidence level where specifically \u03b1 < 0.58 at 1\u03c3 and\n\u03b1 < 0.91 at 2\u03c3. We then showed that a constraint on the\nsubtle, yet potentially important, growth signature is beyond the current weak lensing, BAO and Supernovae data.\nWe allowed almost total cosmological freedom in all these\nanalyses, varying parameters: \u03a9m , h, \u03c38 , \u03a9b , a, b and c for\nboth models, in addition to \u03b1 for mDGP and w0 and \u03b3 for\nthe growth model. Furthermore, we used the \u03beE two point\nstatistic while analytically marginalising over the residual\noffset c\u2032 . We also demonstrated in Section 5.3 that our results are insensitive to a potential over or underestimation\nof the shear at high redshift.\nFinally in Section 6 we looked towards the future space\nbased weak lensing survey, Euclid, and discovered that it\nwill have significant ability to distinguish between modified\ngravity and LCDM. We included a forecast for the mDGP\nmodel finding that even for a lensing only analysis Euclid\n\n\f14\n\nThomas et al.\n0.75\n\n1\n\nl (max) = 10000\nl (max) = 500\n\nl (max) = 500 (1\u03c3)\nl (max) = 500 (2\u03c3)\n\n0.9\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.65\n\n0.7\n0.6\n\n\u03b3\n\n0.6\n\n\u03b1\n\n0.5\n\n0.55\n\n0.4\n0.3\n\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\n0.45\n0.1\n0\n\n0.285\n\n0.29\n\n0.295\n\n0.3\n\n0.305\n\n\u03a9m\n\n0.31\n\n0.315\n\n0.32\n\n0.325\n\n0.4\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n\u03a9m\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\n0.45\n\n0.5\n\nFigure 9. The left panel displays the ability of Euclid's potential constraining power with regards to the mDGP model in a lensing only\nanalysis. Here the 1\u03c3 contour (all solid lines) is well within the \u03b1 = 1, or DGP, line and so it will be easily distinguishable from LCDM\n(\u03b1 = 0). Indeed this corresponds to an error of 0.104 on \u03b1 with lmax = 500 (all red contours) in stark contrast to today's constraint. The\nright panel shows the marginalised contours for the general growth parameterisation. Again, it seems that Euclid will provide excellent\ninsight into any potential modified gravity signatures. Specifically it is found that it will be possible to constrain \u03b3 with an error of 0.045\n(1\u03c3). This is tightened further to an error of 0.038 when lmax = 10000 (black contours). The parameters h, \u03c38 , \u03a9b and ns have been\nvaried and marginalised over for both models considered here while in addition w0 , wa and \u03a30 have been marginalised for the growth\nmodel.\n\ncould restrict \u03b1 to within 0.104 of the fiducial \u03b1 = 0 at\n1\u03c3, even when the deeply non-linear regime has been removed (lmax = 500). In addition, we included a complete and\nconsistent forecast for generalised modified gravity demonstrating that deviations from a fiducial \u03a30 = 0 of 0.25 at\nthe 68% confidence level will be possible with lmax = 500.\nWith lmax = 10000 this gets restricted to \u2206\u03a30 = 0.069. It\nwill also confine \u03b3 to within 0.045 (lmax = 500) and 0.038\n(lmax = 10000) of the fiducial \u03b3 = 0.55 at 1\u03c3, where a full 9\ncosmological parameters were varied.\nIn our analyses with data we have, except as an example\ncase, actively removed angular scales less than 30 arcminutes. This was to remove the contribution from the unknown\nnon-linear regime from the constraints. This constitutes removing vast quantities of attainable data. Not only is this\nclearly not maximising the available information but it could\nbe that non-linear physics acts to emphasise any difference in\ngravitational theory. Therefore it would naturally be highly\nbeneficial to understand the evolution of these density perturbations within this regime. In order to do this there needs\nto be continuing attempts in the community to study Nbody simulations with varying gravitational frameworks.\nEven though we have detailed the advantages of weak\nlensing in a modified gravity study, and even though Euclid\nin particular will be deeply insightful it seems, however,\na collected and coordinated assault on our gravitational\nframework would prove even more advantageous. This\nmight exist in the form of a combination of probes as,\nfor example, discussed in Jain & Zhang (2007), where\nideally the four perturbation variables \u03c6, \u03c8, \u03b4 and \u03b8 are\n\nindependently targeted. This in principle would allow us\nunprecidented experimental scrutiny on the structure of our\ngravitational theory over large scales. However, to conclude,\nit is clear that to actually solve the tantalising problem\nthat grips cosmology there needs to be a paradigm shift\nanalogous to those that have revealed the great problems of\nthe past.\n\nAcknowledgements: It is a pleasure to thank the\nCFHTLS team for their kind distribution of the lensing data.\nParticular thanks go to Martin Kilbinger and also Liping Fu\nfor answering and discussing some of the more technical aspects of the data and potential systematics.
