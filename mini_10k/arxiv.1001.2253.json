At the\nbeginning used vacuum tube, diode [1-3] and next time used\nbipolar transistor [4]. At the beginning of rectifier circuit by\ndiode and bipolar transistor, it has zero-crossing signal error\nand low precision. Because of diode and bipolar transistor\nhave to use voltage driver working power around 0.3 V for Ge\nand 0.7 V for Si. So, the lower signal circuit unable to\nworking. Next time, the limited of lower signal circuit has\ndevelopment such as rectifier circuit by Op-amp connected to\ndiode, rectifier circuit by Op-amp connected to diode and\nbipolar transistor, and rectifier circuit AB class mode [9]. The\nresult from circuit development is able to rectify the limited of\nlower signal circuit [1-5], responsiveness at narrowness\nfrequency [2-7] and high dissipation current source to\ntransistor. So, this paper is present a new choice of easy to\nunderstand and noncomplex of rectifier circuit, but it still have\nhigh quality in working function, it able working at high\nfrequency, responding at high input current, high precision\nsignal, low power dissipation, and uses a little transistor.\nII.\n\nFigure 1.
