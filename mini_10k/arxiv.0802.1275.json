The classical view\nis that this transition takes place through an homogeneous nucleation process and can be reasonably well described in the framework of classical nucleation theory\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Nucleation theory is based on the fact,\nthat a nucleation event is an activated process, taking\nplace on time scales much larger than the characteristic\ntime scale of the microscopic dynamics. The free energy\nof forming a crystalline embryos from the metastable surroundings is defined by a positive surface and a negative\nbulk contributions. The surface term corresponds to the\ncost in free energy for creation of an interface between\nparent and incipient (say, crystalline) phases, whereas\nthe bulk term is proportional to the volume of the nucleus. The crystal size, wherein the free energy reaches\na maximum and the system begins to crystallize, defines\nthe critical nucleus.\nWith the increase of the degree of supercooling \u2206T the\ndescription of the transition towards the ordered phase\nbecomes more complicated. On the one hand, the height\nof nucleation barrier decreases with supercooling \u2206T as\n1/\u2206T 2, so that at supercooling \u223c 40% and higher a very\nfast crystal nucleation could be expected [7]. On the\nother hand, observations at a very large supercooling indicate nascent droplets that exhibit a ramified structure\n[8] and a crystallization process with a more extended,\ncollective and spatially scattered character that may be\nattributed to a spinodal regime [9]. Such tendencies are,\nhowever, balanced by the kinetic slowing down, which\nmakes the ordering process more and more difficult to observe as the temperature is lowered. In the limit, where\nthe system is deeply supercooled and becomes glassy,\ncrystal formation is completely unobservable on experimental time scales.\nThe application of external field on a glassy material may change considerably this picture of nucle-\n\nation. What influence has an external forcing, such as\nshear flow and/or strain, on the nucleation process of a\nglass? Experimental studies of amorphous (co)polymers\nreveal the appearance of shear-induced crystallization\n[10, 11, 12, 13]. This is verified by molecular dynamics\nsimulations, which provide some evidence for an increase\nof ordering in a sheared polymeric and model binary\nglasses [14, 15]. Recently, results of molecular dynamics simulations showed that the oscillating shear strain\ncan promote crystallization in a model jammed systems\n[16]. However, the influence of shear rate and strain on\nthe ordering processes as well as the possibility of crystallization under stationary shear have remained unclear.\n\nAt a moderate supercooling, simulation results on the\nsheared colloidal melts of Refs. [17, 18] demonstrate the\nsuppression of nucleation by a homogeneous shear flow.\nMore precisely, they reveal that the probability of the\nnucleation decreases, while the size of critical nuclei increases with the shear rate. In a glassy systems at low\ntemperatures, on the other hand, it is reasonable to suggest that the external drive can activate dynamical processes [19, 20]. A moderate external shear field will increase the local diffusivity in the system, hence having\na positive influence on the kinetic factors for nucleation,\nand thereby it will trigger crystallization. However, a\ncontinued shear may destroy a crystalline nuclei as they\nform and a steady nonequilibrium state can be expected.\n\nIn the present work we focus on the influence of a\nstationary shear on the ordering processes in a glassy\nsystem. In Sec. II we describe our model system and\nthe analysis used to identify crystallinity and solid-like\nclusters. The simulation results and outcomes of cluster\nanalysis are shown in Sec. III, where we also study the\ninfluence of strain and shear rate on the ordering. We\nfinish in Sec. IV with a discussion of the main results.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nSYSTEM AND PROCEDURES\n\nOur system consists of 23328 particles interacting\nthrough a standard truncated and shifted Lennard-Jones\npotential\n\uf8f1 \u0014\u0010 \u0011\n\u03c3 12 \u0010 \u03c3 \u00116\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u2212\n4\u01eb\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nr\nr\n\uf8f2\n\u0012 \u001312 \u0012 \u00136 #\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n(1)\nU (r) =\n, r \u2264 rc\n\u2212\n+\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nrc\nrc\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0,\nr > rc ,\n\n\u01eb and \u03c3 are the characteristic energy and length scales,\nand rc = 2.5\u03c3 is the cutoff distance. The following reduced units\np are used in this work. The time is in units\nof \u03c4 = \u03c3 m/\u01eb, where the mass m is set to unity. All\ndistances are given in units of \u03c3. The temperature is in\nunits of \u01eb/kB , whereas the pressure and the stress are in\nunits of \u01eb/\u03c3 3 . The time step \u25b3\u03c4 used in our simulations\nis 0.005\u03c4 .\nWe start with a system equilibrated in the liquid state\nat the temperature T = 1.65\u01eb/kB in a cubic simulation\nbox (V = L3 and L = 30.2327\u03c3) with periodic boundary conditions in all directions. After this, the system\nis quenched to the temperature T = 0.15\u01eb/kB within\na time interval t = 2.5\u03c4 . In the case of argon atoms\nwith the Lennard-Jones parameters \u01eb/kB = 120 K and\n\u03c3 = 3.4\u00c5 this corresponds to a cooling rate \u223c 1013 K/s\n[21]. After such a rapid quench, the system at this temperature is in a glassy state [22, 23, 24, 25]. This is\nevidenced by the zero slope of mean square displacement\non the time scale of our simulations, which is a signature\nof \"structural arrest\". The disordered character of the\nstructure is also evident from the split second peak of\nthe pair distribution function, typical of an amorphous\nmaterial.\nBefore shearing, the system is allowed to \"age\" during\nt = 10 000 \u03c4 without any external forcing. In order\nto shear the system, we create two parallel solid walls\nby freezing all the particles in the x-z plane over the\nrange of three inter-particle distances from both ends of\nthe simulation box in the y-direction. Both walls are\namorphous. By using walls, we can impose an average\nstrain rate without any assumptions about the resulting\nflow inside of the sample. A snapshot of the simulation\ncell is presented in Fig. 1. Twelve independent samples\nwere prepared with the same procedure.\nA constant shear rate \u03b3\u0307 is then applied by moving in\nthe x-direction all the atoms of the top wall with the\ninstantaneous velocity\nUwall = \u03b3\u0307Ly ex ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhereas the particles of the bottom wall remain fixed;\nLy is the distance between the walls. Periodic boundary conditions are applied along the x and z directions\nonly. All the results are for a constant normal pressure\nPyy = 1.1867\u01eb/\u03c3 3 (corresponding to the pressure observed initially). Temperature is controlled by rescaling\n\nFigure 1: (Color online) A snapshot of the simulation cell.\nTwo parallel amorphous walls (dark particles) restrict the\nsheared system. The particles of the top wall are removed\nwith the velocity proportional to the distance between the\nwalls Ly , which is variable with the time due to the normal\npressure Pyy . The particles of the bottom wall are fixed.\n\nof velocity component of the particles along the neutral\nz-direction, which is perpendicular to the shear x and the\nvelocity gradient y directions.\nIn order to identify the local structure and, in particular, the appearance of solid-like clusters, we use the local\norder analysis introduced originally in the work of Steinhardt et al. [26] and developed by Frenkel and co-workers\n[7, 27, 28]. An important advantage of this method is\nthat (i) it allows one to recognize the crystallinity regardless of a specific structure, and (ii) the crucial parameters\nhere, such as local and global order parameters, are rotationally invariant, so that the orientation of clusters in\nspace is irrelevant.\nFirst of all, the local surroundings of each atom can be\ncharacterized by a (2\u00d76+1)-dimensional complex vector\nwith the following components:\nNb (i)\n1 X\nq6m (i) =\nY6m (\u03b8ij , \u03c6ij ),\nNb (i) j=1\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Y6m (\u03b8ij , \u03c6ij ) are the spherical harmonics, Nb (i)\ndenotes the number of the nearest neighbors of particle\ni; \u03b8ij and \u03c6ij are the polar and azimuthal angles formed\nby the radius-vector rij and some reference system. We\ndefine \"neighbors\" as all atoms located within a given\nradius rc = 1.5\u03c3 around an atom i, i.e. |rij | < rc , where\nrc corresponds practically to the first minimum in the\npair distribution function. The local orientational order\n\n\f3\nparameter can be defined for each atom i as\n6\n4\u03c0 X\n|q6m (i)|2\n13 m=\u22126\n\nq6 (i) =\n\n!1/2\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nwhich is a rotationally invariant. Thus, the global orientational order parameter can be defined as an average of\nq6m (i) over all N particles:\n\uf8eb\n\nPN PNb (i)\n\n6\n4\u03c0 X\n\uf8ed\nQ6 =\n13 m=\u22126\n\ni=1\n\nj=1\nPN\ni=1\n\nY6m (\u03b8ij , \u03c6ij )\nNb (i)\n\n2\n\n\uf8f61/2\n\uf8f8\n\n.\n\n(5)\nFor perfect fcc, bcc and hcp systems one has Q6 = 0.5745\nand Q6 = 0.5106 and Q6 = 0.4848, respectively, whereas\nin a fully disordered system in the limit of large sizes,\n(e.g. a liquid) Q6 is close to zero [29]. Hence, an increase\nof this quantity provides the evidence for the formation\nof local crystallites. To estimate the degree of ordering\n(crystallinity) in our system we use, along with Q6 , the\npotential energy as well as the number of \"solid-like\" particles.\nThe occurrence of ordered structures can also be observed in the behavior of the radial distribution function.\nHowever, this function corresponds to the averaged result\nfor the whole system, and, as a consequence of this, can\nbe insensitive to the appearance of a few local clusters.\nFor the study of local structures we apply the following\ncluster analysis [7]. For every pair of nearest neighbors,\nsay i and j, the following condition is considered:\n6\nX\n\nm=\u22126\n\n\u2217\nqe6m (i)e\nq6m\n(j) > 0.5,\n\n(6)\n\n\u2217\nqe6m (i)e\nq6m\n(i) = 1.\n\n(7)\n\nwhere qe6m (i) is the complex vector q6m (i) defined by Eq.\n(3) and normalized in accordance with\n6\nX\n\nm=\u22126\n\nCondition (6) allows one to verify that atom j belongs to\nan ordered structure around atom i. If atom i has seven\nor more neighbors satisfying the condition (6), then this\natom is considered as a solid-like, i.e. it is included in an\nordered crystalline structure.\nIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nWe now turn to the results, which quantify the effect\nof shear on an initially amorphous sample. The time evolution of the global orientational order parameter Q6 for\nvarious values of the shear rate \u03b3\u0307 is shown in Fig. 2.\nNote that the results presented here have been averaged\nover different runs. From these results, it appears clearly\nthat the degree of order in the system is enhanced by\nshear. Moreover, at the larger values of the shear rate \u03b3\u0307\n\nFigure 2: (Color online) The evolution of the global orientational order parameter Q6 at the various shear rates \u03b3\u0307 as\na function of time. The shear rate increases from bottom to\ntop. The full lines are linear fits to the data. The arrow\nindicates the value of Q6 for a perfect fcc structure.\n\nthe ordering takes place rather rapidly, Q6 levels off after this initial transient. For \u03b3\u0307 = 0.01 and 0.005\u03c4 \u22121 the\norder parameter reaches a plateau value with Q6 \u2248 0.42\nover the time scale of observation. At lower values of \u03b3\u0307\nthe rate of ordering (defined as the time derivative of the\norder parameter) is lower and decreases with the time,\nas it is clear seen from the change in slope in the curves\nshown in Fig. 2. As a result, the time window t = 2500\u03c4\npresented in Fig. 2 is not sufficient to achieve a maximal\nordering at slow shear rates. It is particularly noteworthy that the shear can initially prevent the formation of\nsmall clusters, which would appear even in the absence of\nshear. This week suppression effect is observed for very\nsmall shear rates \u03b3\u0307 = 0.0001 and 0.000 01 \u03c4 \u22121 , where the\nvalues of Q6 are lower in comparison with the case of a\nsample at rest. Nevertheless, the increase of the order\nparameter with time is clearly detected even for these\nsmall shear rates. Our first conclusion is therefore that\nshear enhances crystallinity with a rate, which depends\non the shear rate.\nAlthough the largest value of the order parameter Q6\nobtained by shearing the glass is low in comparison with\nQ6 of a perfect fcc structure, it indicates a high level of\ncrystallinity in the system. The formation of crystalline\nordered structures in a sample can be also observed from\nthe radial distribution function as shown in Fig. 3(a) for\na particular shear rate \u03b3\u0307 = 0.001 and different times after\nstarting up of the shear. In the first three curves the appearance of crystalline structures is evident from the rise\nof the extra-peak between the first and second maxima in\nthe distribution, which is a typical signature of fcc structures. The pair correlation function calculated at large\n\n\f4\ntimes shows that the order extends over large distances,\nwith oscillations extending up to r > 4\u03c3. Such a longrange ordering could also be associated with layering of\nthe system under shear. To check this, we evaluated the\ndensity profiles at different times as a function of the distance from the walls. As can be seen in Fig. 3(b), which\npresents the density profiles at t = 500 and 2500\u03c4 (the\ncurves for intermediate times are very similar to those\npresented in Fig. 3(b)), the transverse order is present,\nbut not particularly pronounced.\n\nA.\n\nStrain and strain rate dependance\n\nThe strain dependence of the global order parameter\nQ6 is shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that the order\nparameter increases with the strain \u03b3 for all values of the\nshear rate. Moreover, the evolution of the order parameter with strain is clear separated into two steps. The\nfirst stage, during which the the order parameter rises\nrapidly, is shear rate dependent. After this fast increase,\nQ6 reaches an \"universal\" (shear rate independent) behavior shown by a straight dashed line in Fig. 4. At\nthis stage, the order parameter demonstrates a very slow\nincrease and eventually levels off at large strains.\nIn order to quantify the influence of shear rate on the\nordering, we introduce the \"ordering strain\" \u03b3m . This\nquantity defines the strain scale, where the evolution of\nQ6 merges with the universal behavior shown by a dashed\nline in Fig. 4. The shear rate dependence of \u03b3m is plotted\nin the inset of Fig. 4. The data for \u03b3m (\u03b3\u0307) can be fitted\neither by a power-law or by a logarithmic dependency on\nthe strain rate:\n\u03b3m \u221d \u03b3\u0307 1+n , n = \u22122/3,\n\n\u03b3m = \u03b30 +\n\n1\nln(\u03b3\u0307), \u03b30 = const.\n2\n\n(8a)\n\n(8b)\n\nIt should be noted, that the power law behavior is supported by the idea that the typical relaxation time t\u03b1 of\na sheared glassy system decreases with the strain rate as\n\u03b3\u0307 \u22122/3 (see Ref. [30]). Assuming that a similar dependency holds in our crystallizing system and the initial\nrise of Q6 corresponds to a typical relaxation time, we\nobtain\ntm \u223c \u03b3\u0307 \u22122/3 .\n\nFigure 3: Structural characteristics of the sample under shear\n(at the shear rate \u03b3\u0307 = 0.001\u03c4 \u22121 ): (a) Radial distribution\nfunction at the different times after starting the shear flow:\nt = 0, 250, 500, 750, 1500 and 2500\u03c4 (from bottom to top).\nThe curves are shifted upwards for clarity. (b) Density profiles\nfor two different times as averaged over a time window of 10\u03c4 .\n\nMoreover, the layering is weaker for t = 2500\u03c4 , whereas\nthe pair correlation function displays the more pronounced structure. This observation leads to the conclusion that the long-range order observed in the pair\ncorrelations is caused mainly by the formation of a crystalline clusters.\n\n(9)\n\nwhere tm = \u03b3m /\u03b3\u0307. Such a power-law decay of the crystallization time with the shear rate could also be related\nto the one found experimentally in Refs. [11, 13].\nAlthough the possible relation between the characteristic time scale t\u03b1 and the time of ordering tm under shear\nis attractive [30], it is seen in the inset of Fig. 4 that\nthe power-law with (8a) does not provide a perfect fit of\n\u03b3m at shear rates \u03b3\u0307 \u2248 0.01\u03c4 \u22121 and higher, whereas the\nlogarithmic dependence (8b) gives a good fit to the data\nfor all values of the shear rate.\nWe finally discuss our results with regard to recent\nobservations reported by Duff and Lacks [16]. These authors studied the ordering of a similar system under an\noscillatory strain in the low temperature and low shear\nrate limit. A degree of ordering comparable to the one\nobserved in our study was obtained after two cycles with\nthe amplitude 0.25. As a result, it would correspond to a\ntotal strain \u03b3m = 0.5, which is comparable to the values\nobtained by us at the lowest shear rates.\n\n\f5\n\nFigure 4: (Color online) Main: Strain dependence of the\nglobal orientational order parameter Q6 at the different shear\nrates \u03b3\u0307 = 0.0001, 0.0005, 0.001, 0.005 and 0.01\u03c4 \u22121 (from left\nto right). The correspondence between curves and shear rates\nis the same as in Fig. 2. The dashed line is the linear interpolation, indicating the steady behavior (plateau) in the strain\ndependence of order parameter. Inset: Shear rate dependence\nof the strain \u03b3m , at which the order parameter reaches the\nplateau value. Errors are defined by the change of slope in\nQ6 (\u03b3). The solid and dotted curves are the logarithmic and\npower-law approximations, respectively (see text).\n\nB.\n\nNature of the semi-crystalline state\n\nAlthough the system clearly becomes more ordered under the influence of strain, the degree of order achieved\nby our system is low in comparison to that of a perfect\ncrystal. A very remarkable fact is that, at large strains,\nthe order parameter Q6 appears to be dependent only\non strain and not on strain rate. This observation indicates some \"universality\" of the semi-crystalline state\ncreated in the system. This observation is, however, easily explained by considering the velocity profiles in the\nsheared systems. The velocity profiles presented in Fig.\n5 exhibit a strong localization of the shear in two shear\nbands located near the solid walls. The semi-crystalline\npart of the sample, on the contrary, flows with an almost\nuniform velocity (although some plastic activity is also\ntaking place in this \"non-flowing\" part). The situation\ndescribed here is very similar to the shear localization\nobserved in a flowing glass by Varnik et al. [31]. The\nnanocrystalline solid is submitted to a stress, which is insufficient to cause flow, while two strongly fluidized bands\nsustain the shear entirely. What is remarkable here, this\nis a high value of the shear rate and the stress, at which\nthis coexistence is observed (see Fig. 6). While the yield\nof the solid in Ref. [31] was observed for a strain rate\nslightly above 0.001\u03c4 \u22121 and a stress of 0.6\u01eb/\u03c3 3 , our results indicate here a yield stress \u03c3Y > 0.8\u01eb/\u03c3 3 .\nWe expect that this nanocrystalline state consists in\nan assembly of crystallites with disordered orientations.\nThis set of crystallites can be quantitatively described by\n\nFigure 5: (Color online) Rescaled velocity profile as a function\nof distance from the bottom (unmoved) wall. Main: shear\nwith \u03b3\u0307 = Uwall /Ly = 0.01\u03c4 \u22121 at different points of the strain\n\u03b3 above \u03b3m = 3. The broken line corresponds to u/Uwall =\n0.36. Inset: shear rate \u03b3\u0307 = 0.001\u03c4 \u22121 at two different strains\nabove \u03b3m . Results are averaged over the time window t =\n\u2206\u03b3/\u03b3\u0307, where \u2206\u03b3 = 0.01 is the strain scale. All runs exhibit\na similar behavior.\n\nmeans of the cluster analysis presented in Sec. II. The\nresults of this analysis are shown in Fig. 7 as a function\nof the strain \u03b3 for a particular shear rate, since the results\nfor other values of the shear rate are very similar. The\n\nFigure 6: Connected empty circles: Shear stress versus strain\nrate in the sheared part of the velocity profiles shown in Fig.\n5. Connected full circles: stress as a function of the average\nshear rate in the sample. These curves are indicative of a\ncoexistence between a rapidly flowing shear band and a nonflowing solid below its yield stress.\n\nsample is imperfectly crystallized in such a way that only\n\u223c 80% of the particles are involved in crystalline clus-\n\n\f6\n\nFigure 7: Different characteristics vs. strain at the shear rate\n\u03b3\u0307 = 0.001\u03c4 \u22121 after a single run: (a) Number of solid-like particles in a whole system (connected full circles) and potential\nenergy per particle (solid line). (b) Number of crystallites\n(connected open circles). The dashed line corresponds to the\nvalue 415.\n\nters. Obviously, the rapid build up of crystalline order\nbetween \u03b3 = 0 and \u03b3m corresponds to a rapid decrease in\nthe potential energy [see Fig. 7(a)]. The next interesting feature is that the number of solid-like clusters [see\nFig. 7(b)], after a significant growth with the strain, remains essentially constant, whereas the evolution of the\npotential energy and of the order parameter indicates a\ncontinued ordering process in the system. This leads to\nthe conclusion that the system under shear decomposes\nrapidly into a set of crystalline \"grains\". The subsequent\nevolution consists in rearrangements involving the grinding of grain boundaries and the alignment of neighboring\ngrains without any significant coarsening.\nAnother interesting information about the final state\nof the system can be extracted from the size distribution\nof the crystalline grains, which is presented in Fig. 8\nat three different shear rates. As can be seen from these\nhistograms, the distribution is dominated by small grains\ninvolving less than 50 particles. At first sight, the distribution appears to be, within the accuracy of our data,\nshear rate independent. This is consistent with the universal behavior of the order parameter observed in Fig. 4.\nNevertheless, the distribution displays a relatively slow\ndecaying tail for cluster sizes larger than 100 particles.\nThis decay can be well approximated by a power law\n(see inset of Fig. 8). Closer examination reveals that\nthe weight of this tail depends weakly on shear rate and\nthat larger clusters can be observed at lower shear rates.\nUnfortunately, the small number of large clusters makes\n\nFigure 8: (Color online) Main: Cluster size distribution at the\ndifferent shear rates \u03b3\u0307 = 0.01, 0.001 and 0.0001\u03c4 \u22121 (dashed,\nthin and thick lines, respectively) and for a strain of 400%,\nwhere the system is characterized by the order parameter\nQ6 \u2248 0.37 for all shear rates (see Fig. 4). Each histogram\nis averaged over different runs. Inset: The same distribution\nin log-log representation. The solid line is the interpolation\nof the tail of the distribution at \u03b3\u0307 = 0.01\u03c4 \u22121 by a power-law\ndependence.\n\na systematic investigation of this effect difficult.\n\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION: SHEAR SUPPRESSION\nVERSUS SHEAR ENHANCEMENT\n\nOur results demonstrate clearly that the shear increases initially the tendency of a one-component amorphous system towards crystalline order. This behavior\nshould be discussed in the context of the recent studies\nby Blaak and L\u00f6wen, who demonstrated on the contrary\na shear suppression of the nucleation rate at moderate\nundercooling [17], and of the recent results of Ref. [9]\nconcerning the evolution of the nucleation barrier with\ntemperature. Clearly, the main influence of shear at low\ntemperature will be on the kinetic, rather than on the\nthermodynamic, aspects of the transition. In the absence\nof shear, the diffusivity is essentially zero, so that the\nsystem does not evolve with time. However, according\nto the classical nucleation picture, one would expect the\nappearance of crystallinity in the form of a few isolated\nnuclei after a significant time lag associated with the free\nenergy barrier. Our results, on the contrary, indicate an\ninstantaneous increase of crystalline order as soon as the\nshear is started, that is more consistent with a spinodal\ndescription. The system is rapidly driven towards a new\nenergy minimum as soon as a mobility is reinstalled by\n\n\f7\nthe shear flow. The order appears uniformly inside the\nsystem, which relaxes locally towards a crystalline structure on a time scale, which is characteristic of a sheared\nglass.\nAfter this initial relaxation, a much slower stage of\ndefect and grain boundary annealing takes place. During this second stage, the state of the system appears\nto be independent on the strain rate and is determined\nby the amount of strain only. The system consists of\ntwo rapidly flowing sheared bands, separated by a slab\nof a nanocrystalline solid, which undergoes a very progressive evolution through plastic rearrangements. This\nnanocrystalline solid appears to have a high yield stress\nin comparison with a similar Lennard-Jones glass.\nIt is remarkable that, although the flow rate at the\nboundary increases, the evolution of the solid slab seems\nto be insensitive to this flow rate. A possible explanation\nis in the fact that the energy in a yield stress system is\ndissipated by the flow, which will serve to activate annealing processes in the solid slab. As a result, the local\nstructural transformations are defined essentially by deformations and insensitive to strain rate.\nThe non-flowing part of the system can be mainly described as a collection of the crystalline grains of rela-\n\ntively small size. The stationarity in the number of crystallites indicates that the disruption of crystalline order\nby the shear at the boundaries compensates completely\nthe coarsening process, which would be expected in a\nsystem with a nonzero atomic diffusion.\nFinally, it appears that the shearing of an initially\namorphous one-component system constitutes a reproducible way to obtain a nanocrystalline state, which was\nsometimes taken in the past as a possible model of an\namorphous systems. It will be interesting to study such a\nstate for its structural, vibrational and rheological properties, that should be intermediate between those of a\nglass and of a perfect crystal.\n\n[1] P. G.
