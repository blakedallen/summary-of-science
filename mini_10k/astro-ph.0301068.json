Introduction\nThe central regions of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are far more\npowerful emitters than all the stars of the galaxy combined. AGN\nclassified as BL Lac objects are characterized by a predominantly nonthermal, highly polarized continuum that is variable in both total\nintensity and polarization at all observed wavelengths, with weak or\nno optical line emission. All but the last characteristic are shared by\nOptically Violently Variable (OVV) quasars. These extreme phenomena are understood as a consequence of relativistic beaming in their\nnuclei.\nThe near-consensus view of AGN is that they are powered by mass\nflows around a super-massive black hole. The details of the physical\nprocesses are still not well-understood, however, and we do not yet have\na comprehensive theory of AGN that can predict the whole range and\nvariety of observed AGN properties from a minimal set of well-defined\nparameters. Therefore, taxonomy as a substitute for quantification of\nparameters still plays a major role in the investigation of their physics.\nFor example, radio galaxies are classified into types FR I and II since\nthere are no known physical parameter(s) that can explain the whole\nrange in properties of radio galaxies as a class.\nc 2018 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

The adopted AGN taxonomy.\n\nIn the \"radio\u2013loud\" AGN (i.e., those AGNs with radio power exceeding the optical power by an order of magnitude or more) there is compelling evidence that bulk relativistic motion (Blandford and K\u00f6nigl, 1979)\nis ubiquitous, which leads to relativistic aberration effects, so that\nthe angle to the line of sight plays a dominant role in the appearance of these objects (Urry and Padovani, 1995). For every Dopplerboosted object, there are intrinsically similar objects whose jets are\nnot directed toward us \u2013 the \"parent\" population. By comparing properties that are known to be independent of orientation for objects\nthat are known to be boosted and not boosted, we can attempt to\nidentify a given class of Doppler-beamed objects with their plane-ofsky counterparts or \"parent objects\". For example, BL Lac objects\nare believed to be beamed FR I radio galaxies (Orr and Browne, 1982,\nWardle et al., 1984), i.e., radio galaxies with relatively low radio luminosities and jets that spread out into diffuse plumes (Fanaroff and Riley, 1974).\nSimilarly, quasars have been identified as beamed FR II radio galaxies\n(the OVVs being the most highly beamed ones). This process of identifying beamed and parent objects is known as Unification of AGNs.\nWhether or not there is a dichotomy in the intrinsic properties of FR I\nand FR II radio galaxies remains a matter of debate, as is the physical\norigin of the observed differences.\n\n2. \"Red\" and \"Blue\" BL Lacs\nAmong the BL Lacs, two subclasses have emerged. The first BL Lacs\nwere discovered from radio surveys, but X-ray surveys later yielded\nmany more BL Lacs which had somewhat differing properties. The\nradio-selected BL Lacs (RBLs) were typically more core-dominated\non arcsec-scales, showed higher average optical polarization and greater\nvariability and had more powerful radio lobes than the X-ray selected\nBL Lacs (XBLs) (Laurent-Muehleisen et al., 1993). In other words, it\nappeared that the RBLs were more \"extreme\" than XBLs.\n\nKharbShastri.tex; 24/12/2018; 8:01; p.2\n\n\fMagnetic Field Geometry in \"Red\" and \"Blue\" BL Lacs\n\n3\n\nIn the light of the fact that orientation is known to play a major role\nin the observed properties of AGN, it was suggested that RBLs were\noriented at closer angles to the line of sight than XBLs \u2013 the \"Different\nAngle Scenario\" (Stocke et al., 1985). This was explained in the framework of an accelerating jet model (Ghisellini and Maraschi, 1989), wherein\nthe X-rays were radiated in the slower part of the jet and were therefore\nless beamed than the radio photons coming from the faster portion\nof the jet. The different-angle scenario predicted that XBLs should\nbe more numerous than RBLs in a statistically complete sample. The\nprediction was consistent with the observations of the time.\nThe fly in the ointment was the systematic trend discovered in the\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs) (Figure 2, Urry and Padovani\n(1995)). The RBL SEDs typically peak in the near infrared (low\u2013energy\npeaked BL Lacs (LBLs) or \"red\" BL Lacs), whereas the XBL SEDs\ntypically peak in the soft X-ray regime (high\u2013energy peaked BL Lacs\n(HBLs) or \"blue\" BL Lacs). The different-angle scenario could not\nexplain this difference in the SED peaks. Most, though not all, RBLs\nare LBLs and most, though not all, XBLs are HBLs. We will adopt this\nlatter terminology, since it is more physical.\n\nFigure 2. Spectral Energy Distributions show that the synchrotron peaks for the\nLBLs lie in the NIR/optical regime and for HBLs in the EUV/soft-X-ray regime.\n\nThe discovery of the systematic differences in the SED peaks of\nthe \"blue\" HBLs and \"red\" LBLs gave rise to the alternative \"Different Energy Cutoff Scenario,\" wherein the X-ray emitting regions of\nHBLs have higher electron Lorentz factors or magnetic fields than LBLs\n(Sambruna et al., 1996). This scenario would then predict that LBLs\nshould be more numerous than HBLs.\n\nKharbShastri.tex; 24/12/2018; 8:01; p.3\n\n\f4\n\nKharb e.a.\n\n3. Motivation\nThe peaks of the SEDs of core-dominated quasars (CDQs), LBLs and\nHBLs form a sequence of increasing frequency. The CDQs are thought\nto be beamed FR II radio galaxies, while the BL Lac objects are\nthought to be beamed FR I radio galaxies. As if reflecting this dichotomy, there is a systematic difference between the magnetic-field\ngeometries observed for the VLBI jets of BL Lacs (mostly LBLs) and\nCDQs, viz., the ordered component of the jet magnetic field tends to\nbe parallel (perpendicular) to the local jet direction in CDQs (LBLs)\n(Cawthorne et al., 1993, Gabuzda et al., 2000).\nWe wished to explore the parsec-scale magnetic field geometries in\nthe HBLs, to see if this geometry reflected the sequence in the SED\npeaks. We accordingly undertook pc-scale polarimetric imaging of Xray selected BL Lacs from the HEAO-1 survey.\n\n4. Observations\nPolarization VLBI observations were made at 5 GHz in February 1993\n(using a global array of three European and six US antennas), July 1995\nand June 1998 (both using the NRAO 1 Very Large Baseline Array).\nThe sample consisted of 21 northern hemisphere BL Lacs detected in\nhard X-rays by the HEAO\u20131 survey (Wood et al., 1984) and six BL\nLacs from the ROSAT-Green Bank (RGB) sample (Laurent-Muehleisen et al., 1997).\nCalibration, fringe fitting and imaging were done using the Astronomical Image Processing System (AIPS) with the polarization calibration\nfollowing standard methods (Cotton, 1989). Results for 4 XBLs from\nthis sample have been previously published (Kollgaard et al., 1996).\n\n5. Results\nThe VLBI polarization observations of LBLs (primarily from the 1-Jy\nsample (Kuehr and Schmidt, 1990), e.g., Gabuzda et al. (2000) and references therein) and HBLs (our work) reveal that both LBLs and HBLs\nhave compact \"core-jet\" morphologies. We present the radio maps of\nsome of the objects from the HEAO-1 sample in Figures 3\u20134.\nSeveral of the HBLs that we have observed show evidence for a\n\"spine+sheath\" magnetic-field structure, with the inner region if the jet\nhaving transverse B field and the edges having longitudinal magnetic\n1\n\nThe National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National Science\nFoundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated Universities, Inc.\n\nKharbShastri.tex; 24/12/2018; 8:01; p.4\n\n\f5\n\nMagnetic Field Geometry in \"Red\" and \"Blue\" BL Lacs\n\nfield. This type of B-field structure could be a result of interaction\nof the jet with the surrounding medium. Particularly good examples\nare the HBLs 1230+253 (Figure 4c) and 1727+502 (Figure 4d). This\nmay point in the direction of a helical magnetic field threading the\njets of at least some of these objects, which could have implications for\nmechanisms for the production of circular polarization in them.\nThe orientation of the parsec-scale core polarizations of HBLs and\nLBLs relative to the inner VLBI jet direction do not show any obvious\nsystematic differences. In both cases, there is a clear tendency for the\ncore polarization electric vectors to lie either parallel or perpendicular\nto the jet direction (Gabuzda et al., 2000). The physical origin of this\nbimodal behaviour is not entirely clear, though it may be due at least\nin part to optical depth effects (Gabuzda, these proceedings).\nIn contrast, the jet polarizations of HBLs and LBLs do display\nsystematic differences, as can be seen in Table I. Among both types\nof BL Lac there are sources in which the observed jet polarization\nangles lie parallel or perpendicular to the local jet direction. However,\nthe polarization angles are perpendicular to the jet in the majority of\nHBLs, while they are aligned with the jet in the majority of LBLs.\nAssuming that the emission region is optically thin, which is certainly\nthe case for the jet, we infer that the magnetic (B) field is perpendicular\nto the observed polarization angle. Thus, the LBLs show predominantly\ntransverse jet magnetic fields, while the HBLs show predominantly\nlongitudinal jet fields.\nTable I.

Circular polarization\nIt has been argued that the sequence in the SED peaks of CDQs, LBLs\nand HBLs might reflect a sequence in magnetic field strength/Lorentz\n\nKharbShastri.tex; 24/12/2018; 8:01; p.5\n\n\f6\n\nKharb e.a.\n\nfactors (Sambruna, 1994). Since the detectability of circular polarization may also be linked to the magnetic field strength and/or geometry\nand the low-end of the Lorentz factor distrubution (if the circular polarization is produced by Faraday conversion of linear polarization), we\nlooked for evidence for a connection between the parsec-scale B field\ngeometry and previous detections of circular polarization.\nTo this end we compiled all previous circular polarization measurements we could find in the literature (see Table II). We found such\nmeasurements for a total of 73 quasars and 21 BL Lacs, in addition\nto 52 galaxies, made on various spatial scales. Of the 21 BL Lacs, 19\nare LBLs and only 2 are HBLs. We divided the measurements into\nthree groups on the basis of spatial scale: parsec-scale, kiloparsec-scale\nATCA, and kiloparsec-scale single-dish (Table II).\nTable II.

There is some\nevidence from the VLBI measurements (Homan et al., 2001) and singledish measurements (Weiler and de Pater, 1983; Komesaroff et al., 1984)\nthat the circular-polarization detection rate may be higher for quasars\nthan for BL Lacs. Could this be a consequence of the fact that most of\nthe quasars observed have brighter compact nuclei than the BL Lacs ?\nFigure 5 shows the distribution of the total flux density on the\nrelevant spatial scales for all the circular polarization observations. The\nobservations are again divided into groups as in Table II (see above).\nIn the case of the single-dish measurements of circular polarization\n(left-most panels in each row), the distributions are of the total flux\ndensity of the compact component, i.e., from a VLBI measurement,\nas given in Weiler and de Pater, 1983. In the case of the ATCA and\nVLBI measurements (middle and right-most panels), the distributions\nare of the total intensity measured by ATCA and VLBI, respectively.\nIt is especially clear in the VLBI circular polarization measurements\n\nKharbShastri.tex; 24/12/2018; 8:01; p.6\n\n\fMagnetic Field Geometry in \"Red\" and \"Blue\" BL Lacs\n\n7\n\n(last column of histograms) that nearly all of the relatively few BL Lac\nobjects for which circular polarization measurements are available fall\nat the low end of the flux density range for the observed quasars. However, the situation is not clear, since (i) there is no obvious difference in\nthe detection rates for CDQs and BL Lacs in the ATCA measurements\n(Rayner et al., 2000), and (ii) the quasars in which circular polarization\nis detected in the ATCA and single-dish observations have flux densities\nthat fall in the same range as those of BL Lac objects. Further, in\nthe single-dish observations of radio galaxies, circular polarization is\ndetected in compact components with much lower flux densities than\nthe weakest components in BL Lacs in which circular polarization is\ndetected.\nIf systematic differences in the circular-polarization detection rates\n(or other properties of the circular polarization) observed in CDQs,\nLBLs and HBLs could reliably be shown to be present or absent,\nthis could lead to interesting clues to the origin of the circular polarization. Circular polarization observations of well-selected samples,\nfor eg., comparable HBLs and LBLs, are needed to search for relationships between magnetic-field geometry and other properties of the\ncompact radio emission and the circular-polarization detection rate.\nWell-selected samples might necessitate observations of relatively faint\nsources, but this is not unrealistic as Figure 5 shows. If established,\nsuch relationships could potentially provide useful information about\nthe Lorentz factors and magnetic-field strengths in the jets of different\nsubclasses of BL Lacs and quasars.\nA circular polarization analysis of all sources in the 1-Jy sample of\nnorthern BL Lac objects (mostly LBLs) defined by Kuehr and Schmidt\n(1990) is underway (Gabuzda and Vitrischak, in preparation).\n\n7. Conclusions\n1. The ordered component of the B fields in the parsec-scale jets of\nthe \"blue\" HBLs tend to be parallel to the local jet direction. This\ncontrasts with the tendency for the B fields in the parsec-scale\njets of the \"red\" LBLs which are be perpendicular to the local jet\ndirection.\n2. The systematics of the magnetic field geometry thus do not reflect\nthe sequence in the SED peaks of CDQs, LBLs and HBLs.\n3. The VLBI core polarization angles do not show any systematic\ndifferences between HBLs and LBLs.\n\nKharbShastri.tex; 24/12/2018; 8:01; p.7\n\n\f8\n\nKharb e.a.\n\n4. Several of the observed HBLs show evidence for a \"spine+sheath\"\nmagnetic-field structure, with transverse B field in the inner region\nof the jet and longitudinal B field at the edges. This may point\nin the direction of a helical magnetic field threading the jets of\nthese objects, in turn having implications for mechanisms for the\nproduction of circular polarization in them.\n5. Currently available circular polarization measurements in the literature suggest that quasars may be more likely to show detectable\ncircular polarization than BL Lacs. However, the situation is not\nclear, since the largest difference in detection rates are found in\nthe VLBI measurements, and the low detection rate for the BL\nLac objects in this case may be due to the fact that the observed\nquasars have on average brighter VLBI cores than the BL Lacs.\n6. Given the recent advances in circular polarization measurement\ntechniques on both arcsecond (ATCA) and milliarcsecond (VLBI)\nscales, which have made detections possible in at least a minority\nof BL Lacs (and quasars) with relatively faint compact cores, it is\nbeginning to become feasible to obtain circular polarization measurements of well-defined samples on various scales. This would\nthen enable rigorous tests of the predictions of various scenarios\nfor the physical differences between different types of object.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to acknowledge the contribution made by Ron Kollgaard and Sally Laurent-Muehleisen in initiating the VLBP project\non HEAO-1 BL Lacs, without which this work would not have been\npossible.
