This detector has been calibrated and in operation since\nJanuary 2000. Figure 1 shows a schematic view of the new AMANDA-II array. The first\ndata analyses are currently underway. In this report we present an update on the results from\nthe AMANDA-B10 detector, which operated during the austral winter 1997. This detector,\nconsisted of 302 optical sensors on 10 strings located at depths of 1500 to 2000 m in the deep\nAntarctic ice.\nThe main science goal of the AMANDA project is to search for extra-terrestrial neutrinos,\nfrom sources such as active galaxies, or Gamma-ray bursts. As a precursor to such a search, we\nhave focussed on the detection of atmospheric neutrinos, which essentially act as a calibration\n\n\fDepth\nsurface\n50 m\n\nsnow layer\n\n60 m\n\nAMANDA-A\n\n810 m\n\n1000 m\n200 m\n\nAMANDA-B10\n120 m\n\n1150 m\n\nOptical\nModule\n1500 m\n\nmain cable\n\nHV divider\n\n11\n00\n\npressure\nhousing\n\nPMT\n\nsilicon gel\n\n2000 m\nlight diffuser ball\n\n2350 m\nAMANDA as of 2000\nEiffel Tower as comparison\n(true scaling)\n\nzoomed in on\nAMANDA-A (top)\nAMANDA-B10 (bottom)\n\nzoomed in on one\noptical module (OM)\n\nFigure 1: The AMANDA-II array at the South Pole\n\nsource, allowing us to check the correct performance and understanding of the detector. In this\npaper, we first discuss the atmospheric neutrino search in some detail, then report on the status\nof the search for extra-terrestrial neutrinos.\n2\n\nAtmospheric Neutrinos\n\nWe have searched for atmospheric neutrinos in the 130.1 live days of data collected throughout\n1997. Calibration and basic detector properties are similar to the prototype AMANDA-B4 1\ndetector. Figure 2 shows the expected trigger level fluxes of downgoing muons (\u223c 6 * 106 events\nper day) and atmospheric neutrinos (a few tens of events per day). The energy threshold for\nthese atmospheric neutrinos is about 30-50 GeV.\nThe atmospheric neutrino analysis 2,3 has been performed by two nearly-independent groups\nin the collaboration. This has contributed to the introduction of new ideas and has provided for\nsome important cross checks of the analysis. While we here report the results of one analysis 5 , the\nsecond 6,3 comes to very similar and statistically consistent conclusions. Neutrinos are identified\nby looking for upward going muons. We use a maximum likelihood method 7 , incorporating a\ndetailed description of the scattering and absorption of photons in the ice, to reconstruct muon\ntracks from the measured photon arrival times. The events in the analysis presented here were\n\n\f10 8\n\n40\n\n10 7\n\n35\n\nData\nAtmospheric \u03bd MC\n\n30\n\n10 6\n\n25\n10 5\n20\n10 4\n\n15\n\n10 3\n\n10\n\n10 2\n-1 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2\n\n5\n0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1 -0.9 -0.8 -0.7 -0.6 -0.5 -0.4 -0.3 -0.2 -0.1\n\ncos(\u03b8)\n\n0\n\ncos(\u03b8)\n\nFigure 2: Left: The zenith angle distribution of AMANDA triggers. The solid line represents triggers from\ndowngoing cosmic ray muons. The dashed line shows triggers produced by atmospheric neutrinos. Right: The\nzenith angle distribution of upward reconstructed events. The size of the hatched boxes indicates the statistical\nprecision of the atmospheric neutrino simulation.\n\nreconstructed with a Bayesian method 8 , in which the likelihood function is multiplied by a prior\nprobability function. This follows from Bayes' theorem, which says that the probability of an\nhypothesis given data (P (H | E)) is proportional to the product of the likelihood of the event\ngiven the hypothesis (L(E | H)), and the prior probability of the hypothesis P (H)\nP (H | E) \u221d L(E | H)P (H)\n\n(1)\n\nWe know a priori that downgoing muon hypotheses have a zenith dependence, and are overall\nmore likely than upgoing hypotheses by about 5 orders of magnitude. We therefore search for\nthe hypothesis H that maximises the joint probability distribution L(E | H)P (H). This greatly\nreduces the number of downgoing muons that are misreconstructed as upgoing. A small fraction\nof the downgoing muons (5 * 10\u22126 ) are reconstructed as upward and form a background to the\nneutrino-induced events. This background is removed by applying quality criteria to the time\nprofiles of the observed photons as well as to their spatial distribution in the array. A measure of\nthe event quality has been defined by combining six quality variables into a single parameter. A\nhigh event quality is reached when the values of all six parameters agree with the characteristics\nof a correctly reconstructed muon track. The reconstruction and increasingly stringent cuts on\nthe event quality reduces the background of a total of 1.2*109 events by a factor of approximately\n108 , while retaining about 5% of the neutrino signal (1.) The distribution of the single quality\nparameter for experimental data and for a Monte-Carlo simulation of atmospheric neutrinos is\nshown in Figure 3. It compares the number of events passing various levels of cuts; i.e., the\nintegral number of events above a given quality. At low qualities, the data set is dominated\nby misreconstructed downgoing muons, most of which are reproduced in the Monte Carlo. At\nhigher cut levels, the passing rates of data closely track the simulated neutrino events, and the\npredicted background contamination is very low.\nWe can investigate the agreement between data and Monte Carlo more systematically by\ncomparing the differential number of events, rather than the total number of events passing\nvarious levels of cuts. This is done in figure 3 (right), where the ratios of the number of events\nobserved to those predicted from the combined signal and background simulations are shown.\nOne can see that at low quality levels there is an excess in the number of misreconstructed\nevents observed. This is mainly due to instrumental effects such as cross talk which are not\nwell described in the detector Monte Carlo. There is also an excess, though statistically less\n\n\fData\nAtmospheric \u03bd MC\n\n10\n\nDowngoing \u03bc MC\n\n3\n\n10 2\n\nData / \u03a3 MC\n\nEvents Passing\n\n10 4\n\n11.33\nA0\n\n6\n\n/ 14\n0.5789\n\n0.4693E-01\n\n5\n4\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n1\n1\n10\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n2.5\n\n5\n\n7.5 10 12.5 15 17.5 20 22.5 25\n\n0\n\n0\n\nQuality Cut\n\n2.5\n\n5\n\n7.5 10 12.5 15 17.5 20 22.5 25\n\nEvent Quality\n\nFigure 3: Event quality.

Nevertheless, over the bulk of the range there is close\nagreement between the data and the simulations, apart from an overall normalization factor. In\nthe range where the line is shown the ratio of Data/MC is about 0.6. Counting all events above\nthe quality cut (7.0) this ratio is 0.70. It should be emphasized that the quality parameter is a\ncombination of all six quality parameters, and so the flat line in figure 3 demonstrates agreement\nnot only in individual cut parameters but also quantitative agreement in the correlations between\ncut parameters.\nThe zenith angle distribution for the 204 events is shown in Figure 2, and compared to that\nfor the signal simulation. In the figure the Monte Carlo events were normalized to the observed\nevents. The achieved agreement in the absolute flux of atmospheric neutrinos is consistent with\nthe systematic uncertainties of the absolute sensitivity and the flux of high energy atmospheric\nneutrinos. The shape of the zenith distribution of data is statistically consistent with the\nprediction from atmospheric neutrinos. The zenith distribution reflects the angular acceptance of\nthe narrow but tall detector. Two hundred and twenty three events were found in an independent\nanalysis 6 . The overlap of 102 events with the sample presented here is within expectations. The\nobservation of atmospheric neutrinos at a rate consistent with Monte-Carlo prediction establishes\nAMANDA-B10 as a neutrino telescope.\n3\n\nNeutrino science with AMANDA\n\nThe AMANDA-B10 data has been searched for evidence of several classes of neutrinos, and for\nmagnetic monopoles. The following sections briefly describe the status of these searches.\n\n\f3.1\n\nSearch for a diffuse high energy neutrino flux\n\nNo. of events\n\nFollowing on from the observation of atmospheric neutrinos, the first search we report is that\nfor a diffuse flux of extra-terrestrial neutrinos.\nThese neutrinos are expected to have a harder energy spectra (\u223c E \u22122 ) than that of the atmospheric neutrino background (\u223c E \u22123.7 ). Some method of energy determination must therefore\nbe used. A simple measure of the energy of the muon, and thus indirectly the energy of the\noriginal neutrino, is the number of optical modules that fire during the passage of the muon.\nHigher multiplicities correspond to higher muon and neutrino energies. Figure 4 shows the\nenergy distribution of events that pass the neutrino filter as predicted for a) atmospheric neutrinos and b) an assumed energy spectrum for astrophysical neutrinos following a power law of\ndN/dE\u03bd = 10\u22125 E\u03bd\u22122 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 GeV\u22121 . When using the number of fired optical modules as\na measure of energy we obtain the distributions given in figure 4. The assumed astronomical\nneutrino flux would generate a significant excess at high numbers of fired optical modules. A\npreliminary analysis does not show such an excess.

It is comparable to the AGN prediction by Salamon and Stecker 13\nand approaches the prediction of Protheroe 19 .\n\n3.2\n\nPoint sources\n\nA search for a point source of neutrinos is, in some ways, easier than the diffuse neutrino flux\nsearch. Not only can we dramatically reduce the background by searching in a small angular\nbin about the postulated source direction, we can directly measure this background to the\nsearch by counting the events in the off-source bins at the same declination. This is in contrast\nto the diffuse search where the background has to be estimated from Monte Carlo.

We have searched for both specific point sources, and also\nfor \"hidden\" point sources, the latter through an all-sky search. The median angular resolution\nof the AMANDA-B10 array is 3\u25e6 , giving 319 search bins in an all-sky search. In absence of a\nsignal we calculate upper limits to a neutrino flux from point sources. The preliminary average\nneutrino flux limits are at a level of dN/dE\u03bd \u223c 10\u22126 E\u03bd\u22122 cm\u22122 s\u22121 GeV\u22121 .\nOne point source search of particular interest is that for Markarian 501. The AMANDA\nneutrino flux limit for this source is only about a factor of ten above the level of the gammaray emission during Markarian 501's high gamma-ray emission state in 1997. This means that\nthe AMANDA detector has reached the level of sensitivity where models that predict neutrino\nemissions of the order of the gamma emissions can be tested.\nFigure 5 shows the expected neutrino fluxes from various sources, together with the current\npreliminary AMANDA upper limit (90% C.L.). The atmospheric neutrino background is given\nfor a 2 by 2 degree bin. Also indicated in the figure is the expected limit that might be achieved\nby the proposed Icecube detector, a kilometre scale array planned for construction at the south\npole. Several models of point source neutrino production are shown: curve 4 \u2013 3C273 pp\nneutrinos 10 , 5 \u2013 Crab Nebula 11 , 6 \u2013 Coma Cluster 12 , 7 \u2013 3C273 p\u03b3 neutrinos 13 , 8 \u2013 Supernova\nIC443 14 .\n3.3\n\nGamma-Ray Bursts\n\nA search for neutrinos in coincidence with gamma-ray bursts has been conducted. According to\nthe relativistic fireball model, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are expected to be astrophysical sources\nof high energy neutrinos 24,25,26 . The GRB direction and burst time are known from satellite\nobservations of these objects. In some models, neutrinos are expected within a short time (\u223c 10\nseconds) of the gamma-rays. This allows us to make nearly background free observations, by\nrestricting the search bin to a specified direction and time. With \u223c 1/3 sky coverage, the BATSE\nsatellite instrument detected 304 gamma-ray bursts in 1997. AMANDA data for 78 gamma-\n\n\fray northern hemisphere bursts detected on-board the BATSE satellite have been examined for\ncoincident neutrino emission. No excess of neutrinos has been found above a background of 17.2\nevents for all 78 bursts. Due to the low background, the detection of even a few events from a\nsingle burst would be a significant observation.\n3.4\n\nWIMPs\n\nAMANDA can be used to search for non-baryonic dark matter in the form of weakly interacting\nmassive particles (WIMPs). A promising WIMP candidate, the neutralino, is provided by\nthe Minimal Supersymmetric extension to the Standard Model of particle physics (MSSM).\nAssuming that the dark matter in the Galactic halo is (at least partially) composed of relic\nneutralinos, which were formed in the early universe, these massive particles do have a probability\nto get gravitationally trapped in the Earth and other massive objects in the Galaxy (sun, galactic\ncenter). In this theory, the WIMPs lose energy by elastic scattering on nuclei and concentrate\nclose to the core of the Earth. There they can annihilate and neutrinos can be produced in\nthe decay of the created particles. Thus, the search for nearly vertical up-going neutrinos can\nbe used to constrain the parameter space of supersymmetry. No excess of vertical up-going\nneutrinos has been found.\nThe non observation of an excess of vertically up-going muons has been used to set a limit on\nthe flux of neutrinos from WIMP annihilations in the center of the Earth 27 . With only 130 days\nof exposure in 1997, AMANDA has reached a sensitivity in the region of high WIMP masses (\u2265\n500 GeV) that begins to constrain the theoretically allowed parameter space. It is comparable\nin sensitivity to other detectors with much longer live-times.\n3.5\n\nSupernova\n\nBy monitoring bursts of low energy neutrinos AMANDA can be used to detect the gravitational\ncollapse of supernovae in the galaxy. This method takes advantage of the low noise characteristics\n(500 - 1500 Hz/PMT) of the optical sensors in the deep ice. A sensitivity for about 70% of the\ngalaxy is reached at a 90% detection efficiency 28 .\n3.6\n\nMagnetic Monopoles\n\nA magnetic monopole with unit magnetic Dirac charge and a velocity of \u03b2 close to 1 would emit\nCherenkov light along its path, exceeding that of of a bare relativistic muon by a factor of 8300.\nFrom the non-observation of events with this clear signature, a limit of 0.62 * 10\u221216 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121\nfor highly relativistic monopoles has been derived \u2013 a factor of 20 below the Parker bound and\na factor of four below best other limits.\n4\n\nConclusions and Outlook\n\nThe detection of atmospheric neutrinos in agreement with expectation establishes AMANDA as\na neutrino telescope. Since February 2000, the significantly larger and improved AMANDA-II\narray has been collecting data. Its effective area for high energy neutrinos is about three times\nthat of the B10 array. At the same time improved angular resolution and background rejection\npotential are available. The analysis of these data is under way and will improve the given\nresults significantly. A proposal exists to construct the Icecube detector which would consist of\n4800 photomultipliers to be deployed on 80 strings. It will allow us to reach \u223c 1 km2 effective\ntelescope area, above an energy of 1 TeV with an angular resolution of well below 1 degree.\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nThis research was supported by the U.S. NSF office of Polar Programs and Physics Division,\nthe U. of Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, the U.S. DoE, the Swedish Natural Science Research Council, the Swedish Polar Research Secretariat, the Knut and Alice Wallenberg\nFoundation, Sweden, the German Ministry for Education and Research, the US National Energy\nResearch Scientific Computing Center (supported by the U.S. DoE), U.C.-Irvine AENEAS Supercomputer Facility, and Deutsche For-schungsgemeinschaft (DFG).
