Given\nthat assumption, upward radiation flux could support the disk matter against gravity if the\ndensity were essentially constant as a function of height (falling sharply to zero at the top\nsurface) and the radiation pressure fell gradually from the disk midplane to the surface.\nSoon after this equilibrium was discovered, it was found to suffer from several sorts\nof instabilities. Lightman & Eardley (1974) pointed out that if the viscous stress is\nproportional to the total pressure (in this case, dominated by radiation), perturbations with\nradial wavelengths long compared to the vertical thickness h, but short compared to a radius\nr, grow on the (comparatively long) viscous inflow timescale. Shakura & Sunyaev (1976)\nthen observed that in these conditions perturbations in the same range of wavelengths\nwould also grow on the (shorter) thermal timescale. Bisnovatyi-Kogan & Blinnikov (1977)\nnoticed that if the radiation is locked to the gas even on short lengthscales (i.e., if, for the\npurpose of dynamics, the optical depth is treated as effectively infinite), such disks should\nbe convectively unstable, for the specific entropy decreases outward; the linear growth\nrate for convective \"bubbles\" was worked out by Lominadze & Chagelishvili (1984). More\nrecently, Gammie (1998) has demonstrated that a magnetic field in radiation-supported\ndisks can catalyze a short-wavelength (kh \u226b 1) overstable wave mode. In view of these\ninstabilities, it has long been a puzzle just what sort of equilibrium would actually be\nfound in Nature when the accretion rate is high enough that radiation pressure-domination\nmight be expected (see, e.g. Shapiro, Lightman & Eardley 1976; Liang 1977; Coroniti 1981;\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nSvensson & Zdziarski 1994; Szuszkiewicz & Miller 1997; Krolik 1998).\nIn this paper, we take a closer look at the nature of the short wavelength modes in\nradiation-supported disks without magnetic fields. Our goal (motivated by a companion\nwork on radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of such disks: Agol & Krolik 2000b) is to\nexamine more closely which modes can be expected to grow most quickly, what happens\nwhen finite optical depth permits some photon diffusion, and what role, if any, is played by\nassociated perturbations in the local dissipation rate.\n\n2.\n\nProblem Definition\n\nWe begin by writing down the equations of non-relativistic radiation hydrodynamics\nso that we may first describe the equilibrium in this language, and then discuss linear\nperturbations to this equilibrium. Because we are interested in accretion disks, it is\nconvenient to write them in a rotating frame. The first is the usual equation of mass\nconservation:\n\u2202\u03c1\n+ \u2207 * (\u03c1~v ) = 0.\n\u2202t\n\n(1)\n\nOur notation is the usual one, in which \u03c1 is the mass density and ~v is the fluid velocity.\nNext is the the fluid force equation:\n\u03c1\n\n\u2202~v\n~ + 2\u03c1~v \u00d7 \u03a9\n~ \u2212 \u03c1vr (\u2202\u03a9/\u2202 ln r)\u03c6\u0302\n+ \u03c1~v * \u2207~v = \u2212\u2207pg + \u03c1~g + (\u03ba\u03c1/c)F\n\u2202t\n\n(2)\n\n~ is the\nwhere pg is the gas pressure, ~g is the local gravity, \u03ba is the opacity per unit mass, F\nradiation flux, and \u03a9 is the rotation rate of the fluid. Although all the fluid quantities are\n~ ) are defined in the frame of\ndefined in the rotating frame, the radiation quantities (e.g., F\nthe local fluid motion, i.e. including any departures from corotation (Mihalas & Mihalas\n1984). Note that we have omitted magnetic forces.\nFor the two equations describing radiation energy density and momentum density,\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nwe follow Buchler (1979), but write the Lagrangian time derivatives explicitly, i.e.,\nD/Dt = (\u2202/\u2202t + ~v * \u2207). The evolution of radiation energy density E is described by:\n\u2202E\n~ + pr : \u2207~v + E \u2207 * ~v + 2\n+ ~v * \u2207E + \u2207 * F\n\u2202t\nc2\nc2\n\n!\n\n\u2202~v\n~ = Q.\n+ ~v * \u2207~v * F\n\u2202t\n\n(3)\n\nHere pr is the radiation pressure tensor and Q is the net local emissivity. Finally, there is\nthe equation describing the time-dependence of the radiation momentum density (1/c2 )F :\n\u0010\n\u0011\n~ ~v\n1 \u2202F\n~ * \u2207~v + F\n~ \u2207 * ~v + 1 (EI + pr ) * \u2202~v + ~v * \u2207~v = q~. (4)\n~ + c\u2207 * pr + 1 F\n+ * \u2207F\nc \u2202t\nc\nc\nc\n\u2202t\n!\n\nIn this equation, I is the identity matrix and ~q is the net rate per unit volume at which\nphoton momentum is created by radiation (usually negative in the fluid frame because\nphoton momentum is lost due to opacity, while newly-created photons are usually isotropic\nin the fluid frame).\nIn the equilibrium, \u2202/\u2202t = ~v = 0. To isolate the effect of radiation support, we also\ntake the extreme limit of pg \u226a pr . If we regard the rotation of the disk matter as cancelling\nthe radial component of gravity, the only non-trivial remark to make about the equilibrium\nis that Fz = cg/\u03ba, where g = gz (z, r) is the local vertical component of gravitational\nacceleration [in a thin disk, gz (z, r) \u2243 GMz/r 3 for central mass M].\nNow consider perturbed versions of equations (1) through (4). In order to write\nthese perturbations in Fourier-transform form (i.e., for any quantity X, the perturbation\nis \u03b4 X\u0303 = \u03b4X exp{i(kr r + kz z) \u2212 i\u03c9t}), we will suppose that the wavevectors obey three\nconditions: that k = (kz2 + kr2 )1/2 \u226a \u03ba\u03c1; that kz \u226b 1/h; and that kr \u226b 1/r. The first\nlimit means that the diffusion approximation applies, i.e. pr = pr I, so that E = 3pr . The\nsecond is the WKB approximation, as applied to variations in both the radial and vertical\ndirections. Note that we further restrict our attention to axisymmetric perturbations. The\ncondition kz h \u226b 1 also means that we can ignore any gradients in the gravity or equilibrium\nradiation flux. In addition, assuming kr \u226b 1/r allows us to neglect the terms in vector\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\ndivergences arising from cylindrical geometry. For example, after Fourier-transforming,\n\u2207 * \u03b4~v becomes ikr \u03b4vr + \u03b4vr /r + ikz \u03b4vz \u2243 ikr \u03b4vr + ikz \u03b4vz . We then find:\n\u2212 i\u03c9\u03b4\u03c1 + \u03c1i~k * \u03b4~v = 0\n\n(5)\n\n\u2212i\u03c9\u03c1\u03b4vr = (\u03ba\u03c1/c)\u03b4Fr + 2\u03c1\u03a9\u03b4v\u03c6\n\n(6)\n\n\u2212i\u03c9\u03c1\u03b4vz = (\u03ba\u03c1/c)\u03b4Fz\n\n(7)\n\n\u2212i\u03c9\u03c1\u03b4v\u03c6 = (\u03ba\u03c1/c)\u03b4F\u03c6 \u2212 (1/2)\u03c1\u03a9\u03b4vr\n\n(8)\n\n2\u03c9\n\u03b4vz Fz = \u03b4Q (9)\nc2\n+ ikr c\u03b4pr + ikz (g/\u03ba)\u03b4vr \u2212 4i(\u03c9/c)pr \u03b4vr = \u2212\u03ba\u03c1\u03b4Fr\n(10)\n\n\u22123i\u03c9\u03b4pr \u2212 3\u03c1g\u03b4vz + ikz \u03b4Fz + ikr \u03b4Fr + 4pr (ikz \u03b4vz + ikr \u03b4vr ) \u2212 i\n\n\u2212i\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212i(\u03c9/c)\u03b4Fr\n\ng\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\n\u03b4Fz + ikz c\u03b4pr +\n(2ikz \u03b4vz + ikr \u03b4vr ) \u2212 4i pr \u03b4vz = \u2212cg\u03b4\u03c1 \u2212 \u03ba\u03c1\u03b4Fz\nc\n\u03ba\nc\n\u2212i(\u03c9/c)\u03b4F\u03c6 + i(kz /c)Fz \u03b4v\u03c6 \u2212 4i(\u03c9/c)pr \u03b4v\u03c6 = \u2212\u03ba\u03c1\u03b4F\u03c6\n\u0013\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\nThe second and third equations in this set are the two components of the fluid force\nequation, with the vertical component reduced by the fact that the radiation flux exactly\nbalances gravity in the equilibrium. The last three equations are the three components of\nthe radiation flux equation. These equations may be further simplified by the assumption\n(verifiable post hoc) that \u03c9 \u226a \u03ba\u03c1c; that is, the wave frequency is very small compared to\nthe mean time between photon scattering events.\nWith the further approximation that pr \u226a \u03c1c2 , equations (5) \u2013 (12) may be\nmanipulated to yield a dispersion relation. This relation is most conveniently displayed in\nq\n\nterms of dimensionless quantities, so that \u03c9 = \u03c9\u2217 g/h and ~k = ~k\u2217 /h. To satisfy the WKB\napproximation, k\u2217z \u226b 1 and k\u2217r \u226b h/r. The dispersion relation is then seen to depend on\nsix dimensionless combinations of parameters:\npr\n\u03c1gh\n\u221a\ngh\nG =\nc\nP =\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n\u03a92\u2217 = h\u03a92 /g\n\n(15)\n\n\u03c4 = \u03ba\u03c1h\n\n(16)\n\nQp = (\u2202Q/\u2202pr )(h/g)1/2\n\n(17)\n\nQ\u03c1 = (\u2202Q/\u2202\u03c1)(hg 3 )\u22121/2\n\n(18)\n\nNote that here g is g = gz (z), the local value of the vertical gravity. In any thin disk,\nthe quantity G \u226a 1, for it is of order the free-fall speed from the top of the disk to\nthe midplane in units of c. The relative importance of rotational effects is given by \u03a92\u2217 ,\nwhich is simply h/z for Keplerian rotation. The parameter P is also a function of height\nabove the midplane. In an optically thick disk, P = 12 [1 + 1/\u03c4 \u2212 (z/h)2 ]/(z/h). Thus,\nthe two parameters P and \u03a92\u2217 could be replaced by the single parameter z/h. The last\ntwo dimensionless parameters describe the sensitivity of the dissipation to the radiation\npressure and the density, respectively. If one could extrapolate the \"\u03b1\" prescription to local\nfluctuations, one might expect that Qp \u2243 \u03b1.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nThe Dispersion Relation\nGeneral considerations\n\nIn terms of these dimensionless quantities, the dispersion relation is:\nh\n\ni\n\n3\u03c9\u22175 + ik\u22172 /(G\u03c4 ) \u2212 3k\u2217z G/\u03c4 \u2212 iQp \u03c9\u22174\n\u2212\n+\n+\n\n\u0010\nh\n\n\u0011\n\n3\n4k\u22172 P + 3\u03a92\u2217 + ik\u2217z\n/\u03c4 2 \u2212 ik\u2217z GQp /\u03c4 \u03c9\u22173\n\ni\n\n3\n4k\u2217z\nP G/\u03c4 \u2212 ik\u22172 \u03a92\u2217 /(G\u03c4 ) + iQp (\u2212ik\u2217z + \u03a92\u2217 ) \u2212 ik\u22172 Q\u03c1 \u03c9\u22172\n\nh\n\ni\n\n2\n2\n2\n4k\u2217z\nP \u03a92\u2217 \u2212 3k\u2217r\n+ k\u2217z\nG(ik\u2217z Q\u03c1 \u2212 Qp )/\u03c4 \u03c9\u2217\n\n2\n+ k\u2217z k\u2217r\n\u03a92\u2217 /(G\u03c4 ) + k\u2217z \u03a92\u2217 (ik\u2217z Q\u03c1 \u2212 Qp ) = 0.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nIn the limit of \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e and Qp = Q\u03c1 = 0, this dispersion relation simplifies to\ni\n\nh\n\nh\n\ni\n\n2\n2\n\u03c9\u2217 = 0.\nP \u03a92\u2217 \u2212 k\u2217r\n\u03c9\u22175 \u2212 (4/3)k\u22172 P + \u03a92\u2217 \u03c9\u22173 + (4/3)k\u2217z\n\n(19)\n\nOne root is clearly \u03c9\u2217 = 0.

The second pair\n2\n2\ndescribe buoyancy behavior (cf. Balbus 1999). If k\u2217z\n\u03a92\u2217 \u2265 (3/4)k\u2217r\n/P , there are two\n2\n2\nneutrally stable gravity (epicyclic) waves; on the other hand, if k\u2217z\n\u03a92\u2217 < (3/4)k\u2217r\n/P , one\n\nmode is damped, but the other grows exponentially with essentially no oscillation. It is this\nlast mode that corresponds to convection. Although rotation tends to have a stabilizing\neffect, when \u03a9\u2217 > 0 one can always find a mode with kr /kz large enough to satisfy this\ncriterion. As a consequence, when radiation pressure dominates gas pressure in a very\noptically thick disk, the standard equilibrium is always unstable to convection. However,\nrelatively strong rotational effects (i.e., \u03a92\u2217 P \u223c (h/z)2 relatively large, or location near the\nmidplane) do diminish the range of wavevector directions that is unstable.\n\n3.2.\n\nDependence on parameters\n\nAs already remarked, both P and \u03a9\u2217 are determined by z/h, and both should be,\nexcept very near the midplane, \u223c 1. Because the growth rate of the fastest growing mode in\nthe optically thick limit is \u2243 P \u22121/2 , and P decreases upward, convective instability should\ndevelop most rapidly near the top of the disk. This expectation is borne out when the full\nequations are solved: as predicted by equation 20, when kr \u226b kz , the growth rate is nearly\n\nindependent of |~k| and is \u2243 7\u00d7 greater at z/h = 0.9 than at z/h = 0.1.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nThe optical depth \u03c4 in a radiation pressure-dominated Shakura-Sunyaev disk is\n4/3 \u22121 3/2 \u03ba\n\u1e41 x\n\u03c4=\n\u03b1\n\u03baT\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\nRz RT\n,\n2\nRR\n\n(21)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the usual dimensionless stress parameter, \u1e41 is the accretion rate in Eddington\nunits for unit efficiency, x is the radius in units of GM/c2 , \u03ba/\u03baT is the opacity relative to\npure Thomson opacity, and RR,T,z are the relativistic corrections to the dissipation rate,\ntorque, and vertical gravity (Page & Thorne 1974; Abramowicz, Lanza & Percival 1997; see\nalso Agol & Krolik 2000a). Because we expect \u03b1, \u1e41 < 1, but x must be > 1, these disks\nshould be optically thick. However, in the inner part of the disk, \u03c4 might be as little as\n\u223c 102 .\nFig. 1 shows how the growth rate and phase velocity of the unstable convective modes\ndepend on wavenumber and kz /kr when there is no perturbation to the dissipation rate and\nthe optical depth is very large (\u03c4 = 106 ). To illustrate the dependence on optical depth,\nthe same curves are shown in Fig. 2 for a case with the smallest optical depth one might\nexpect, \u03c4 = 102 . In both cases, the range of meaningful wavenumbers (and hence the range\nof wavenumbers displayed in the figures) is limited by two criteria. On the one hand, the\nWKB approximation demands that kz h \u226b 1; on the other, the diffusion approximation is\nonly consistent with kh \u226a \u03c4 . We present results extending out to kh \u223c \u03c4 ; at the highest\nwavenumbers shown, the diffusion approximation has only marginal validity.\n> 1.2, the\nFor fixed optical depth, the growth rate depends on kz /kr ; when kz /kr \u223c\n\nunstable convective mode disappears. For smaller kz /kr (< 0.1), the growth rate is\nindependent of kz /kr . Decreasing the optical depth reduces the extent of the \"flat\" portion\nof the growth rate curve for a given kz /kr . However, the largest value of the dimensionless\ngrowth rate, (\u03c9\u2217i )max , in the wavenumber range of physical interest is almost independent\nof \u03c4 over this range.\nFigs. 1 and 2 also show the phase velocity of the unstable convective mode, normalized\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nto the free fall speed in the disk. For large optical depths, the real frequency of convective\nmodes is so close to zero that they can be considered as non-oscillatory; decreasing\nthe optical depth towards the smallest value (\u03c4 = 102 ) expected for radiation pressure\ndominated disks leads to an increase in the real frequency of the mode, endowing it with a\nnon-negligible phase velocity and, as a consequence, it becomes oscillatory.\nIn the absence of perturbations to the dissipation rate, finite (although large)\noptical depth primarily affects the radiation sound waves (cf. Agol & Krolik 1998). Not\nsurprisingly, as the opacity falls, short wavelength sound waves become damped. Less\nintuitively, convective modes remain unstable even when the diffusion rate (\u223c k\u22172 c/(h\u03c4 ))\nq\n\u221a\nis larger than the characteristic frequency g/h, i.e. when k\u2217 > G\u03c4 . In this regime,\n\nepicyclic motions cause convective modes to acquire an oscillatory character. Convection\nremains unstable even in the face of strong radiative diffusion because the equilibrium gas\ndensity is constant. A parcel that begins to fall because its specific entropy is too small is\nsqueezed as it encounters higher pressure. Its radiation pressure rises, but because diffusion\nis so effective, only up to the ambient level. Meanwhile, however, the increased gas density\nmeans that the parcel's density exceeds that of its neighbors, and it continues to fall.\nSuch impunity to the effects of radiation diffusion does not persist all the way to zero\nopacity, however. When k\u2217 > \u03c4 , the diffusion approximation is no longer a valid description\nof radiation transfer. For wavelengths that short (or opacity that small), the radiation\nstreams freely, entirely independent of gas motions. In that limit, if there is nothing to alter\nthe distribution of dissipation, there is no perturbation to the flux as a function of position,\nand therefore, no perturbation to the force. The result, of course, is that convection\ndisappears.\nAgain applying the Shakura-Sunyaev disk solution, we expect G to be small, for it is\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\ngiven by\n3\n\u03ba\nG = \u1e41\n2\n\u03baT\n\u0012\n\n\u0013 \u0012 \u00131/2\n\nz\nh\n\nx\u22123/2\n\nRR\n1/2\n\nRz\n\n.\n\n(22)\n\nG becomes irrelevant over most of the wavenumber interval of interest when \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e, as\nevery factor in which it appears in the dispersion relation is divided by \u03c4 ; the value of G\n> 0.01\u03c4 ,\ncan still have some influence even at large \u03c4 only for very large wavenumbers, k\u2217 \u223c\n\nsince some of those same terms of the dispersion relation actually are \u221d k\u22172 /\u03c4 or even\n\n\u221d k\u22173 /\u03c4 . However, even when \u03c4 is as large as 105 , some dependence on G begins to appear\nacross the range of interesting wavenumbers. When the optical depth is no larger than\nthis, diminishing G tends to enhance instability, particularly at short wavelengths. When\n\u03c4 \u223c 105 , the growth rate of the very short wavelength convective modes increases by\n< 104 , and G \u223c 10\u22124 , a second\nfactors of several when G falls from 10\u22122 to 10\u22124 . When \u03c4 \u223c\n\nmode, in addition to the convective mode, becomes unstable at short wavelengths. This\nmode is weakly oscillatory, and its very low phase velocity (\u223c 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u2013 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22123 the\nfree fall velocity) behaves similarly to that of damped radiation sound waves at the same\nwavelengths. Analysis of the corresponding amplitudes of the various physical quantitities'\nperturbations shows that this mode has magnitude and especially phase relationships\nbetween perturbations in pressure, density and velocity components that are intermediate\nbetween those of convective modes and those characteristic of radiation sound waves.\nIt is important to note, however, that if the canonical disk solution applies, the product\nG\u03c4 = 2\n\n\u0012 \u00131/2\n\nz\nh\n\n\u03b1\u22121\n\nRT Rz1/2\n.\nRR\n\n(23)\n\nIn other words, the product G\u03c4 should be very nearly independent of radius (if \u03b1 is). Even\nwhere the relativistic corrections are substantial, G\u03c4 hardly changes because RR and RT are\nvery nearly proportional, and Rz has a total range of at most a factor of two (Krolik 1999).\nThus, the criterion for which scaled wavelengths should be substantially affected by photon\n\u221a\ndiffusion (i.e., k\u2217 > G\u03c4 ) is almost independent of radius, but does depend somewhat on\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nz/h.\nGiven our estimate of G (equation 22), we can also verify our expectation that\n\u03c9/c\u03ba\u03c1 \u226a 1. Rewritten in terms of our dimensionless parameters, this ratio is \u03c9\u2217 G/\u03c4 .\nAs we have just estimated, G \u226a 1 and \u03c4 \u226b 1 in radiation pressure-supported \u03b1-disks.\nConsequently, unless \u03c9\u2217 is extremely large, \u03c9/c\u03ba\u03c1 \u226a 1 is a very safe assumption.\nAs already pointed out, Qp is much like a local version of the vertically-averaged\nquantity \u03b1, the ratio of the r\u2013\u03c6 stress to the total pressure. On this basis we expect Qp\nto be somewhat less than unity. The (dimensional) dissipation perturbation coefficient\nQ\u03c1 \u2261 (\u2202Q/\u2202\u03c1), on the other hand, is most closely related to the ratio of the flux to the\nsurface density. In a Shakura-Sunyaev disk, this quantity (reduced to a dimensionless\nnumber according to equation 18), is\nF\u0303\n\u03a3\u0303\n\n!\n\n\u2261\n\n\u0012 \u00133/2\n\nF\n1 3\n1\n=\n3\n1/2\n\u03a3 (hg )\n2 2\n\n\u03b1\u1e413/2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03ba\n\u03baT\n\n\u00133/2\n\n5/2\n\nx\u22123/2\n\nRR\n.\nRz2 RT\n\n(24)\n\nAlthough we don't know for certain that Q\u03c1 \u223c F\u0303 /\u03a3\u0303, it is a likely estimator. On this\nbasis, we expect Q\u03c1 \u226a 1, and should be particularly small at larger radius or in disks with\nrelatively low accretion rate.\nLike \u03c4 , varying Qp or Q\u03c1 affects the radiation sound waves much more than the\nconvective modes. The growth rate of the near-zero real frequency convective mode\nis almost independent of Qp and Q\u03c1 over a large range in these parameters, but the\nlonger-wavelength radiation sound waves become unstable when these parameters are\npositive. For example, when z/h = 0.5, and \u03c4 \u226b 1, the growth rates for positive Qp and\nnull Q\u03c1 are \u2243 (0.1 \u2212 0.16)Qp , and, similarly, those for positive Q\u03c1 and null Qp turn out to\nbe \u2243 (0.1 \u2212 0.16)Q\u03c1 .\nUnlike the convective mode, for radiation sound waves, growth persists to kr /kz < 1.\nAlthough the maximum growth rate does not depend on the value of this ratio, the range\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nof wavelengths for which growth occurs shrinks and moves towards larger wavelengths as\nthe ratio kr /kz decreases.\nSmaller optical depth can also counteract the instability created by positive Qp or Q\u03c1\n(see also Agol & Krolik 1998 for a discussion of radiation diffusion damping of MHD waves).\nIn the very large \u03c4 limit, the maximum growth rate for radiation sound waves is almost\n< 104 it decreases with decreasing\nindependent of the value of the optical depth, but for \u03c4 \u223c\n\n\u03c4 . The radiation sound waves are all damped for \u03c4 < 103 or so; at larger optical depth, the\nshorter wavelength modes remain damped (because, of course, diffusion is most effective\nacting on them), but growth appears for longer wavelengths, with the range of growing\nwavelengths stretching as \u03c4 increases. Fig. 3 shows the behaviour of the imaginary part of\nthe frequency and the normalised phase velocity for radiation sound waves with Qp = 1 and\nQ\u03c1 = 0 as functions of wavenumber for a variety of optical depths.\nSummarizing this discussion, we conclude that there are two sorts of instabilities of\nimportance in radiation pressure-supported disks: convective instabilities, which grow on\nroughly the dynamical timescale, should be very nearly ubiquitous unless the disk becomes\nalmost optically thin; and radiation sound waves, which can be driven unstable (at a slower\nrate) if Qp or Q\u03c1 is positive.\n\n3.3.\n\nComparison with the Classical Convection Problem\n\nIn standard treatments of convection in rotating fluids (e.g., Chandrasekhar 1961), it\nis shown that convection begins when the \"Rayleigh number\"\nR=\n\ng\u03b1V \u03b2h4\n\u03bath \u03bd\n\n(25)\n\nexceeds a critical value (generally \u226b 1) which depends on the \"Taylor number\"\nT =4\n\n\u03a92 h4\n.\n\u03bd2\n\n(26)\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nWriting T for the temperature, we define \u03b1V \u2261 |\u2202 ln \u03c1/\u2202T |, \u03b2 \u2261 |dT /dz|, \u03bath is the thermal\nconductivity, and \u03bd is the kinematic viscosity.\nThis analysis applies partially, but not entirely, to the circumstances of radiationdominated accretion disks. The fact that, rather than entering the fluid solely at the\nbottom, heat is actually generated throughout the fluid probably alters the quantitative\ncriteria for convective instability but should not change anything at a qualitative level. On\nthe other hand, certain contrasts are of greater importance.\nOne that requires mention is that the pressure in these circumstances, unlike in classical\nfluids, depends only on the radiation, and is therefore independent of density. Consequently,\nthermal diffusion can alter the pressure with no change in density. In the classical analog,\nthermal diffusion can quench convective instability by adding heat to falling low-entropy\nfluid elements, thereby forcing them to expand until their density no longer exceeds the\nsurrounding density. This occurs when \u03bath is large enough that R falls below the critical\nvalue. By contrast, in the radiation-dominated case, the density remains unchanged in the\n\u221a\nface of thermal diffusion. This is why convection persists even when k\u2217 > G\u03c4 ; i.e., the\nradiation analog of the Rayleigh number does not accurately predict the effect of thermal\ndiffusion on the instability.\nPerhaps the most important contrast with classical fluids is that there is no easy\ndefinition of the kinematic viscosity. Bulk orbital shear leads to angular momentum transfer\nvia magnetic forces (Balbus & Hawley 1998); these are, of course, entirely absent in our\ntreatment. However, stresses arising from other shears may be quite different, whether they\nare caused by magnetic forces or other mechanisms (for example, photon diffusion: Agol\n& Krolik 1998). For this reason, it is unclear whether the conventional equation of the\nr \u2212 \u03c6 shear stress with a nominal viscosity (as in the Shakura-Sunyaev \u03b1 formalism) is\nappropriate here. In any event, none of these possible viscosity mechanisms is present in\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nour equations; not even radiation viscosity is considered, for no radiation shear stress exists\nin the pure diffusion approximation. Thus, in a formal sense, neither R nor T exists in our\ntreatment of this problem.\nNonetheless, having expressed these caveats, it is still of some interest to estimate what\nT and R may be in radiation-dominated accretion disks in order to make some contact\nwith the classical theory. To do so we make the suspect identification discussed in the\npreceding paragraph: we suppose that the shear viscosity in all directions is given by the\nShakura-Sunayev \u03b1. If so, T \u2243 10\u03b1\u22122 , independent of radius (or anything else). Within the\nradiation-dominated regime, the Rayleigh number is similarly constant: R \u223c O(10)(\u03ba/\u03baT )2 .\nInterestingly, the critical R for 10 < T < 105 is \u223c 103 \u2013 104 (Chandrasekhar 1961). Thus, if\nthe most appropriate analog to ordinary fluid viscosity is correctly estimated by this means,\nthe strong convective instability we find might be quenched; however, as we have stressed,\nit is by no means clear that this analogy applies.\n\n4.\n\nImplications\n\nWe have shown that if an accretion disk is placed in the Shakura-Sunyaev radiationdominated equilibrium, the growth rate of the convective instability is hardly affected by\nlarge changes in parameters such as the opacity or the way in which the local dissipation\nmight be perturbed. This behavior is, perhaps, not surprising, when one considers that the\nconvective instability is essentially dynamical, whereas the opacity and dissipation rates\npertain to the (rather more slowly accomplished) thermal balance.\nGiven that the Shakura-Sunyaev equilibrium is unstable to convection for all\nreasonable parameters, we can hardly expect that it describes the actual state of radiation\npressure-dominated disks. One's first guess might be that what happens instead is that\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nentropy is redistributed so as to make the disks at most marginally unstable to convection\n(Bisnovatyi-Kogan & Blinnikov 1977). If the entropy distribution is at most weakly\nunstable to convection, then departures from hydrostatic equilbrium should be small, and\nthe equilibrium could be determined by applying these two conditions (i.e. isentropy and\nhydrostatic balance). However, marginal stability to convection also suggests that the\namount of heat carried by convection is small, so that radiative diffusion dominates energy\nexchange. Unfortunately, this condition is inconsistent with the first two. Any two of\nthese three conditions suffice to determine the equilibrium; the solution is over-determined\nif all three are applied. The result must be, then, that in real disks none of them is\nsatisfied exactly, but all three are approximately correct. The quantitative character of this\nbalancing act can be determined only by detailed calculations that carry convection into\nthe nonlinear regime (e.g. Agol & Krolik 2000b).\nDeviation from constant specific entropy can certainly be expected near the disk\nsurface. There, radiation diffusion should be able to consistently dominate convection as\na heat-loss mechanism because the diffusion time is much shorter than in the body of the\ndisk. Consequently, the specific entropy distribution near the surface must be clearly stable,\ni.e. rise with increasing altitude.\nThe sense of heat redistribution by convection is to raise the specific entropy near the\ntop and diminish it below. For the same reason that radiative diffusion must dominate near\nthe top, this redistribution can have the side effect of changing the overall rate at which\nheat is able to leave the disk. The mean specific entropy in equilibrium is therefore not\nnecessarily the same as the value predicted by the original Shakura-Sunyaev equilibrium.\nThese remarks do not bear on whether the thermal and viscous instabilities continue\nto plague radiation-dominated disks. It is possible that convection might be able to remove\nextra heat generated in the course of the thermal instability, and might consequently be\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nable to quench it. Whether that is so can only be determined by detailed calculation of\nheat transport by convection in the nonlinear regime (Agol & Krolik 2000b). Whether\nthe viscous instability acts under these conditions depends on the character of dynamical\ncoupling (see, e.g., Agol & Krolik 1998) between the radiation and the MHD turbulence\nthat most likely accounts for angular momentum transport in disks (Balbus & Hawley\n1998).\nWe have also shown that radiation sound waves may be driven unstable if the emission\nof radiation is proportional to either the gas density or the local radiation pressure\n(the latter possibility is suggested by a straight-forward extrapolation of the \"\u03b1-model).\nAlthough phenomenological guesses of this variety are plausible, we do not yet know enough\nabout the physical mechanisms of dissipation in accretion disks to say whether this is what\nshould actually happen. However, if it does occur, growth of radiation sound waves (and,\npresumably, magnetosonic waves) could provide an additional source of turbulence in disks,\nsupplementing magneto-rotational instability and convection. Indeed, if dissipation leads to\nrenewed stirring, there might be interesting twists to the character of the MHD turbulent\ncascade.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nREFERENCES\nAgol, E. & Krolik, J.H. 1998, Ap.

Non-dimensional growth rate, \u03c9\u2217i \u2261 \u03c9i / g/h, and logarithm of absolute value\n\u221a\nof non-dimensional phase velocity, uph \u2261 vph / gh = \u03c9\u2217r /k\u2217 , are shown as functions of\nthe non-dimensional wavenumber k\u2217 = kh. In both plots the curves are labelled with the\ncorresponding value of the ratio of vertical to radial wavenumber kz /kr ; curves for kz /kr < 0.1\nare not shown, since, in the physically meaningful wavenumber range, the growth rates are\nnearly identical to those found for kz /kr = 0.1.\nFig. 2.- Same as in Fig. 1, but for the smallest value of the optical depth expectable in the\ndisk regime under examination, that is \u03c4 = 102 . The range of non-dimensional wavenumbers\nshown is much smaller than for Fig. 1 because of the restriction imposed by using the diffusion\napproximation.\nFig. 3.- Dispersion curves for radiation sound waves in a case including perturbation of\ndissipation rate. The curves shown all refer to kz /kr = 0.7 as a reference value; see the\ntext for discussion of the dependence of the dispersion curves on the value of the ratio\nkz /kr . Different curves are labelled with the corresponding value of the optical depth \u03c4 .\nThe wavenumber interval over which the mode is unstable depends on \u03c4 , growing in extent\ntowards larger wavenumbers with increasing \u03c4 .\n\n\f\f\f\f"}
