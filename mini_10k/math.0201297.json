We compute the moduli space of the corresponding algebraic stack over Z[1/2], as well as the Picard groups\nover algebraically closed fields. We put special emphasis on the study of the fibre of the stack at a prime of wild ramification;\nin particular we show that the moduli space has good reduction at such a prime.\n\nWe are interested here in algebraic curves called N -state Potts curves, previously studied here and\nthere in the literature but not from a modular and arithmetic viewpoint. They provide an interesting\nexample (quite unique in fact) of a stack of Galois covers where the study can be pursued quite far\neven at the primes of wild ramification. We discover interesting phenomena, as well as explanations and\ncommentaries concerning the deformation theory of wild covers of curves (see [BM1]).\nIn the modular theory of covers of curves, much is known in the tame case where the characteristic\np > 0 of the base field does not divide the indices of ramification: these covers form a smooth algebraic\nstack, and it is known how to compactify it with stable covers. By contrast, for example for a Galois cover\nof group G whose order is divisible by p, the (uni)versal deformation ring is very nasty (in general not even\nreduced), meaning that the corresponding classifying stack is far from being smooth. Moreover, there\nexist smooth G-covers in characteristic 0 that do not have good (i.e. smooth) reduction to characteristic p,\nand vice versa there exist smooth G-covers in char. p that do not lift to char. 0. Giving a bridge between\nthese characteristics usually means studying objects over a valuation ring of mixed characteristics (0, p),\nand how they specialize or generize. In the example of Potts curves everything can even be done over\nZ[1/2], and we will be able to decribe quite precisely the behaviour at a prime of wild ramification.\nLet us now describe in more detail the results of the article. Given an odd integer N > 3, an N -state\nPotts curve (or N -Potts curve) is by definition a smooth hyperelliptic curve of genus N \u2212 1, which is a\ncyclic covering of P1 of degree N . We will simplify the treatment of hyperellipticity by avoiding the prime\np = 2, and we will rather focus on wild ramification at primes dividing N . Hence in all the article the\nschemes and stacks considered are over Z[1/2]. Thus the fibered category with objects N -Potts curves\nis an algebraic stack PN over Z[1/2]. Among the main results of the article is the following computation\n(theorems 3.2.1 and 4.1):\n\u2022 If N is not prime, the coarse moduli space of PN is the scheme A1\u2217 \u2297 Z[\n\u2022 If N = p is prime, the coarse moduli space of Pp is the scheme A1\u2217 \u2297 Z[\n\n\u03b6N +\u03b6 \u22121\n1\nN\n, 2N\n].\n2\n\n\u03b6p +\u03b6p\u22121\n2\n\n, 21 ].\n\nIn this statement, A1\u2217 = A1 \u2212 {0} is the punctured line and the arithmetic rings that appear are subextensions of degree 2 of the ring of cyclotomic integers (see 1.4). Note that when N is a composite integer,\nthere does not exist Potts curves in characteristics p|N . We see that, although the stacks (and moduli\nspaces) are connected for arithmetic reasons, at (geometric) primes of tame ramification they split as a\nsum of \u03c6(N )/2 connected irreducible components, where \u03c6 is the Euler function. On the contrary, when\nKey words: covers of algebraic curves, Hurwitz moduli space, algebraic stack, wild ramification, reduction mod p.\nAMS Classification: 14D22, 14H10, 14L30.\n\n1\n\n\fN = p is prime, we show that the moduli space \"has good reduction\" at p, that is to say its formation\ncommutes with the base change Z[1/2] \u2192 Fp :\n\u2022 The coarse moduli space of Pp \u2297 Fp is A1\u2217 \u2297\n\nFp [z]\n,\nz (p\u22121)/2\n\nthe fibre of the moduli space of Pp at p.\n\nThe result (theorem 5.1.2) is even more precise and shows that the map from Pp \u2297 Fp to its moduli\nspace is \u00e9tale, and so this stack is connected but non-reduced with multiplicty \u03c6(p)/2; its reduced part\nis smooth. Hence we can interpret the non-reducedness as coming from the collision of \u03c6(p)/2 smooth\ncomponents in characteristic 0 when we reduce to characteristic p.\nWe also compute the Picard groups of the geometric fibres of PN \u2297 k (k an algebraically closed field\nof characteristic p 6= 2). The first fact to be noted is that these groups are finite at primes of tame\nramification, but not anymore at primes of wild ramification. The second interesting point is that the\nnilpotents contribute a lot to the Picard group of Pp \u2297 Fp , which would certainly not be the case for its\nmoduli space P because it is an affine scheme, hence Pic(Pred ) = Pic(P ). The reason for this is of course\nthe presence of automorphisms. Here is the result (theorems 3.3.3 and 5.2.1) :\n\u2022 If (N, p) = 1 then the Picard group of any connected component of PN \u2297 k is isomorphic to\n(Z/2Z) \u00d7 (Z/2N Z).\nk[z]\n1\n]\n[X, X\n\u2022 If N = p then the Picard group of Pp \u2297k is isomorphic to Z/2Z\u00d7(1+zA), where A = z(p\u22121)/2\n\u00d7\nis the affine ring of the moduli space, and 1 + zA \u2282 A is a multiplicative subgroup.\n\nFinally we mention that in the tame case, it is likely that a little more work would give the expected\n\u22121\n1\nresults concerning the stack of stable N -Potts curves, namely, that its moduli space is P1 \u2297 Z[ \u03b6+\u03b62 , 2N\n].\nWe will say no more than a word about this in 3.4. Concerning the stack of stable p-Potts curves over\nZ[1/2], similar questions arise but here the problems are of course more complicated. It is clear that the\nwork done in the present article makes it tempting to ask what would stable p-Potts curves look like; if\nthere is a 1-dimensional stack of stable N -Potts curves even over characteristics p|N ; what are the stable\nreductions of N -Potts curves in characteristic p, when p divides a non-prime N ... All this is left aside for\nthe time being.\nHere is a short overview of the organization of the article. In the text, the order of apparition of\nthe results is actually rather different from the one above. The first section contains preliminaries on\nfinite subgroups of the projective linear group PGL2 . The second section contains the computation\nof the automorphism groups of Potts curves. Here we make the essential observation that the good\nunderstanding of the stack PN over Z[1/2N ] is via the classical Hurwitz description of branched covers\nby the shape of the ramification. This leads us to start from a different definition for Potts curves, and of\ncourse we eventually show that the two coincide. In the third section, we treat the case of a composite N :\nwe compute the moduli space of PN and the Picard group of its fibres. In the fourth section we extend\nthe construction of the moduli space to the case of the stack Pp with p prime. At last the fifth section is\ndevoted to the study of the fibre of Pp at p.\nConventions. We will consider that every positive integer is prime to 0, so as not to make repeated\nparticular cases when speaking of primality of an integer with the characteristic of a field. The Euler\nfunction is denoted \u03c6 as usual. Finally, in a module M over a commutative ring A, we will denote by\nm \u221d m\u2032 the equality up to multiplication by an invertible element of A.\nAcknolewdgements. It has been a long awaited moment the time to thank here my advisor Jos\u00e9 Bertin,\nwho followed from the beginning the story of Potts curves, with a lot of energy and disponibility. Also\nI express warm thanks to Laurent Moret-Bailly and Ariane M\u00e9zard, who read former versions of this\nwork. Their thorough reading and numerous comments were the source of many improvements. Finally\nI acknowledge a grant from the EAGER network, hospitality of Stockholm University and the Institut\nFourier in Grenoble where most of this work was done.\n\n1\n\nPreliminaries on Dickson's theorem\n\nThere is no pretence to originality in the contents of this section, but the results stated here could not be\nfound in the literature. Because of their simplicity, proofs are sometimes elliptical, if not omitted. The\n2\n\n\freader may without prejudice skip this section and go straight to \u00a7 2, refering to the results below when\nnecessary.\nIn section 2, in the course of the computation of the automorphism group of Potts curves over an\nalgebraically closed field k of characteristic p 6= 2 (see 2.1.9 and 2.2.3), we will have to handle certain\nfinite subgroups of PGL2 (k). Recall from [Su], chap. 3, th. 6.17 that Dickson's theorem for PGL2 takes\nthe following shape:\nTheorem 1.1 (Dickson) Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p 6= 2. Any finite subgroup G \u2282 PGL2 (k) is isomorphic to a subgroup among the following list:\n\u2022 If p is prime to |G|,\n(1) cyclic group, dihedral group, symmetric S4 , alternating A4 or A5 ,\n\u2022 If p divides |G|,\n(2) G = Q \u22ca C a semi-direct product of a normal, elementary abelian, p-Sylow Q by a cyclic group of\norder prime to p,\n(3) A5 if p = 3,\n(4) PSL2 (Fq ) or PGL2 (Fq ) for q = ps , s > 1 integer.\n\n\u0003\n\nIn this section we classify conjugation classes instead of merely isomorphism classes. We define an\nequivalence relation in k \u00d7 by x\u2032 \u223c x \u21d4 x\u2032 \u2208 {x, x\u22121 }. The corresponding class is denoted [x], and the\nmapping [x] 7\u2192 x + x\u22121 is a set-theoretic injection k \u00d7 / \u223c \u0592\u2192 k. Finally let \u03bc\u2217n \u2282 k \u00d7 be the set of primitive\nn-th roots of unity (e.g. \u03bc\u2217p = {1}).\nProposition 1.2 Let A \u2208 PGL2 (k) be an automorphism of finite order n > 1. Then,\n(i) Either n is prime to p, or equal to p.\n(ii) As an automorphism of P1k , A is conjugated to x 7\u2192 \u03b6x, for some \u03b6 \u2208 \u03bc\u2217n , when (n, p) = 1, and to\nx 7\u2192 x + 1, when n = p.\n(iii) The set \u03bc\u2217n / \u223c classifies conjugation classes of elements of order n, and more precisely,\n\nord(A) = n \u21d4 there exists [\u03b6] \u2208 \u03bc\u2217n / \u223c such that (\u03b6 + \u03b6 \u22121 + 2) det(A) \u2212 tr(A)2 = 0\nProof : We work with a representative in GL2 (k), whose eigenvalues are given by the characteristic\npolynomial as \u03bb\u00b1 = 12 (tr(A) \u00b1 \u03b4) with \u03b4 2 = tr(A)2 \u2212 4 det(A). In PGL2 (k), only the class (for the\nrelation \u223c) of the ratio \u03b6 := \u03bb+ /\u03bb\u2212 is well-determined.\nWe have [\u03b6] = 1 if and only if, up to homothety, A is conjugated to a unipotent matrix, i.e. n = p\nand, as a homography, A is conjugated to x 7\u2192 x + 1. We have [\u03b6] 6= 1 if and only if A is conjugated to\nthe diagonal matrix diag(\u03bb+ , \u03bb\u2212 ), and then A has order n if and only if (n, p) = 1 and [\u03b6] \u2208 \u03bc\u2217n / \u223c. As a\nhomography, A is conjugated to x 7\u2192 \u03b6x.\nFor the claim in (iii), one needs just checking that\n\u03b6 + \u03b6 \u22121 =\n\ntr(A) + \u03b4\ntr(A) \u2212 \u03b4\ntr(A)2\n+\n=\n\u22122\ntr(A) \u2212 \u03b4\ntr(A) + \u03b4\ndet(A)\n\u0003\n\nExamples 1.3 As particular cases of 1.2(iii), an element A \u2208 PGL2 (k) has order 2 (resp. order 3, 4, 6\nor p) if and only if tr(A)2 = i det(A) for i = 0 (resp. i = 1, 2, 3 or 4).\n3\n\n\fRemark 1.4 Let \u03b6 be a primitive n-th root of unity (say as a complex number) and \u03a6n the n-th\ncyclotomic polynomial (of degree \u03c6(n)). For future use, we observe that 12 (\u03b6 + \u03b6 \u22121 ) is integral over Z[ 21 ].\nIndeed its minimal polynomial over Q is 2\u2212\u03c6(n)/2 \u03c8n (2t) where \u03c8n \u2208 Z[t] is the monic polynomial such\nthat \u03a6n (t) = t\u03c6(n)/2 \u03c8n (t + t\u22121 ). According to (iii) of the proposition we define an automorphism of\n\u22121\n1\nthe projective line over the spectrum of Z[ \u03b6+\u03b62 , 2n\n], of exact order n on all the fibres, by the following\nmatrix:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b6 + \u03b6 \u22121 \u03b6 + \u03b6 \u22121 \u2212 2\nM\u03b6 =\n1\n2\nCorollary 1.5 Let q = ps for some s > 1. Then the order of an element A \u2208 PGL2 (Fq ) divides q \u2212 1,\nq + 1, or p.\nProof : Take A an element of order n prime to p. By proposition 1.2, there exists \u03b6 \u2208 \u03bc\u2217n algebraic\nover Fq , of degree at most 2, such that A is conjugated to x 7\u2192 \u03b6x. If \u03b6 \u2208 Fq , we have \u03b6 q\u22121 = 1.\ntr(A)2\n)X + 1. But P can also be written\nElse, the minimal polynomial of \u03b6 over Fq is P = X 2 + (2 \u2212 det(A)\nP = X 2 \u2212 (\u03b6 + \u03b6 q )X + \u03b6 q+1 with the Frobenius Fr(x) = xq , generating Gal(Fq2 /Fq ) = Z/2Z. Hence\n\u03b6 q+1 = 1 and we are done.\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 1.6 There are q 2 \u2212 1 elements of order p in PGL2 (Fq ), and they all belong to PSL2 (Fq ).\nMoreover the set of fixed points of all order p elements of PGL2 (Fq ), acting on P1 (k), is P1 (Fq ).\nProof : Simple calculations.\n\n\u0003\n\nIn the sequel we use the concise notation < \u03b1(x) > for the subgroup generated by a homography\n\u03b1 \u2208 PGL2 (k).\nCorollary 1.7 The cyclic and dihedral subgroups of PGL2 (k) are conjugated to:\n\u001a\nCn = < \u03b6 x >\nfor (n, p) = 1 (any \u03b6 \u2208 \u03bc\u2217n )\n(i)\nCp = < x + 1 > for n = p.\n\u001a\nfor (n, p) = 1 (any \u03b6 \u2208 \u03bc\u2217n )\nDn = < \u03b6 x, x1 >\n(ii)\nDp = < x + 1, \u2212x > for n = p.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 1.8 The subgroups of PGL2 (k) isomorphic to S4 (p 6= 2, 3) are conjugated to\nS4 = < ix,\n\nx+1\n> \u2243 < (1234), (12) > .\nx\u22121\n\n\u223c\n\nProof : Let \u03bd : S4 \u2212\u2192 G be an isomorphism with values in a subgroup of PGL2 (k); a = \u03bd(1234) and\nb = \u03bd(12) generate G. Up to conjugation, a(x) = ix. A priori the involution b can be written b(x) = rx+s\ntx\u2212r ;\nusing the fact that ab = \u03bd(134) has order 3, we get r2 = st (see 1.3). Conjugation by \u03c6(x) = rx/t leaves\nx+1\na invariant while b maps to the desired x 7\u2192 x\u22121\n. To complete the proposition, one checks that these two\nelements generate a subgroup isomorphic to S4 .\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 1.9 The subgroups isomorphic to PGL2 (Fq ) are all conjugated to the \"standard\" PGL2 (Fq )\ncorresponding to the field inclusion Fq \u0592\u2192 k; the same result holds for PSL2 (Fq ).\nProof : The standard PGL2 (Fq ) is generated by the following three elements:\ne(x) = x + 1,\n\nf (x) = ux,\n4\n\ng(x) = 1/x\n\n\fq\u22121\nthen v = um is a generator of\nwhere u is any generator of the multiplicative group F\u2217q . Setting m = p\u22121\n\u2217\nv m\nFp ; in particular v is an integer modulo p. Then we have a relation e f = f m e, it is just the homography\nx 7\u2192 vx + v. Also it is immediate that n := ord(eg) is prime to p.\nNow let G be a subgroup of PGL2 (k), and \u03bd : PGL2 (Fq ) \u2192 G be an isomorphism. Denote e =\n\u03bd(e), f = \u03bd(f ), g = \u03bd(g) so that G =< e, f, g >. As f, g generate a dihedral group, by the above result 1.7,\nwith a first conjugation we can suppose that f = f and g = g. The above relations in PGL2 (Fq ) yield:\n\n(\u2020) ep = 1\nLet us write e(x) =\n\nax+b\ncx+d ,\n\n(\u2020\u2020) ev fm = fm e\n\n(\u2020\u2020\u2020) (eg)n = 1\n\nthen (\u2020) reads (a + d)2 = 4(ad \u2212 bc) by 1.2. By induction,\nk\n\ne (x) =\n\nk+1\n2 a\n\nkcx \u2212\n\n\u0001\n\nk\u22121\n2 d x + kb\nk+1\nk\u22121\n2 a+ 2 d\n\n\u2212\n\nWe then write (\u2020\u2020) explicitly and obtain a = d, and c = 0. At this point, e(x) = x + b/a. Then by (\u2020\u2020\u2020)\nand 1.2 there exists \u03bb \u2208 \u03bc\u2217n \u2282 F\u2217q2 such that (1 + \u03bb)2 a2 = \u2212\u03bbb2 . As n divides q \u2212 1 or q + 1 by 1.5, we have\n\u00012\n\u03bb + \u03bb\u22121 \u2208 Fq and so \u03b2 := ab = \u2212(\u03bb + \u03bb\u22121 + 2) \u2208 Fq . Finally we apply a conjugation by \u03c6 : x 7\u2192 ab x,\n1\n>= PGL2 (Fq ) as announced. The case of\nthen G =< x + b/a, ux, 1/x > is mapped to < x + 1, ux, \u03b2x\nPSL2 (Fq ) is similar.\n\u0003\n\n2\n\nPotts curves and their automorphisms\n\nIn this section we describe Potts curves defined over an algebraically closed field, before looking at families\n(hence moduli) in the rest of the article. Let us make precise definitions before we start: in all what\nfollows, by a curve over a scheme S we will mean a proper, flat morphism f : C \u2192 S whose fibres are\nprojective, geometrically connected and one-dimensional; also, except in 3.4, they will be assumed to be\nsmooth. We recall that:\nDefinition 2.1 Let N > 3 be an odd integer. An N -Potts curve is a smooth hyperelliptic curve of genus\nN \u2212 1, which is a cyclic covering of P1 of degree N .\nIn subsection 2.1 where N is prime to p, we have three main goals: showing the equivalence between\ntwo different definitions of Potts curves (2.1.5), giving a modular invariant (2.1.7), and computing automorphism groups (2.1.9 and 2.1.10). In subsection 2.2 where p divides N , we also define an invariant\nand compute the automorphis groups (it turns out to be simpler).\n\n2.1\n\nTame case\n\nIn this case, the curves we are dealing with can be described like in the classical Hurwitz setting, i.e. as\nmaps to P1 with prescribed ramification. This is our starting point; it leads us to change definition 2.1.\nRecall that if a finite group G acts faithfully on a smooth curve C over a field of characteristic p, such\nthat |G| and p are coprime, then the stabilizer of a fixed point is cyclic and its natural representation in\nthe cotangent space of the point is faithful. This gives rise to the Hurwitz ramification datum, i.e. the\nlist of all the corresponding characters at the fixed points.\nLet N > 3 be an odd integer. Set G = Z/N Z, and assume that a generator for G, denoted g, has\nb \u2243 G, we define an equivalence relation by \u03c7\u2032 \u223c \u03c7 if\nbeen chosen once for all. In the character group G\n\u2032\n\u22121\nand only if \u03c7 \u2208 {\u03c7, \u03c7 }. Denote by [\u03c7] the corresponding class.\nDefinition 2.1.1 Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p prime to 2N .\n(i) An N -Potts curve of type [\u03c7] over k is a curve C together with a faithful action \u03c1 : G \u0592\u2192 Autk (C)\nsuch that C/G has genus 0, with four ramification points all with stabilizer equal to G, and Hurwitz\nramification datum {\u03c7, \u03c7, \u03c7\u22121 , \u03c7\u22121 }. An N -Potts curve is an N -Potts curve of type [\u03c7] for some [\u03c7].\n5\n\n\f(ii) An isomorphism between two Potts curves C, C \u2032 is a G-equivariant isomorphism of algebraic curves\n\u223c\n\u03c6 : C \u2212\u2192 C \u2032 .\nRemarks 2.1.2 (i) The action \u03c1 being determined by \u03c3 = \u03c1(g), a Potts curve will be denoted (C, \u03c3).\nIf (C, \u03c3) and (C \u2032 , \u03c3 \u2032 ) are isomorphic N -Potts curves then [\u03c7] = [\u03c7\u2032 ].\n(ii) Of course, from now up to 2.1.5 it is this definition that applies rather than definition 2.1.\n(iii) If \u03c3 acts via \u03c7 on the cotangent space ma /m2a , then \u03c7 is determined by the root of unity \u03b6 := \u03c7(\u03c3).\nHence, the quantity \u03b6 + \u03b6 \u22121 is attached to C, and equivalent to [\u03c7].\nHyperellipticity\nLet (C, \u03c3) be an N -Potts curve. By the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, we get the genus g(C) = N \u2212 1.\nNotice that a birational equation can easily be drawn from the definition: by Kummer theory, the function\nfield k(C) is generated, as an extension of the rational function field k(x), by a single t \u2208 k(C) such that\ntN \u2208 k(x), i.e.\n(x \u2212 a)(x \u2212 b)\ntN =\n(1)\n(x \u2212 c)(x \u2212 d)\naccording to the ramification. Substituting t/(x \u2212 c)(x \u2212 d) to t we get\n\ntN = (x \u2212 a)(x \u2212 b)(x \u2212 c)N \u22121 (x \u2212 d)N \u22121\nwhere \u03c3 acts by t 7\u2192 \u03b6t for some \u03b6. Now in Autk (P1 ) there is one and only one subgroup isomorphic to\nZ/2Z \u00d7 Z/2Z, generated by involutions that interchange the four points a, b, c, d (see [R], \u00a7 1, Lemma 2),\nnamely\n\u001a\n\u001a\n\u001a\na\u2194b\na\u2194c\na\u2194d\n\u03c40 :\n\u03bc0 :\n\u03c40 \u03bc0 = \u03bc0 \u03c40 :\nc\u2194d\nb\u2194d\nb\u2194c\n\nIn order to make the link between 2.1.1 and definition 2.1 we must build a hyperelliptic involution\nfrom \u03c40 and for that we need to recall the following classical construction:\n2.1.3 It is known how to describe a tame cyclic covering of curves (or even, families of curves) in terms of\ninvertible sheaves on the base. A perfect exposition is recalled in [ArV], so we just give a sketch here. For\nn > 2, let S be a scheme with n \u2208 O\u00d7\nS , and \u03b6 \u2208 OS a primitive n-th root of unity. Let X \u2192 S be a smooth\ncurve, and \u03c3 an S-automorphism of order n. By smoothness the quotient morphism f : X \u2192 Y = X/\u03c3\nn\u22121\nis finite flat. By the assumption of invertibility of n, there is a decomposition f\u2217 OX = \u2295j=0\nLj with Lj\nj\nequal to the \u03b6 -eigenspace for the action of \u03c3. The Lj are invertible sheaves, and the multiplication in\nf\u2217 OX gives injective maps Li \u2297 Lj \u2192 Li+j (i + j is read modulo n). In particular, as \u03c3 n = id, we get\nLn1 \u2243 OY (\u2212D) where D is the effective Cartier branch divisor of f .\nConversely, given L = L1 and a global section s whose divisor of zeroes is D (so s is determined up to\nn\u22121\na global invertible section), we can reconstruct the Lj and endow A = \u2295j=0\nLj with a product mapping\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(l, l ) \u2208 Lj \u00d7 Ln\u2212j to sll \u2208 OY , and we recover X = Spec(A).\nAs a conclusion, we can consider the datum of an S-curve X with an automorphism of order n as being\nequivalent, up to isomorphism, to that of a triple (Y, L, s) where L \u2208 Pic(Y ) and s is a global section of\nL\u2212n . Furthermore there is an obvious fonctoriality in (Y, L, s): for a map (Y \u2032 , L\u2032 , s\u2032 ) \u2192 (Y, L, s) given by\nan affine S-morphism \u03b1 : Y \u2032 \u2192 Y and a map \u03b2 : L \u2192 \u03b1\u2217 L\u2032 respecting the sections, there is an induced\nmorphism h : X \u2032 \u2192 X with \u03c3h = h\u03c3 \u2032 .\n\u0003\nBack to our situation, the action of \u03c3 on the Potts curve C is described by L = O(\u22122) and s =\n(X \u2212 a)(X \u2212 b)(X \u2212 c)N \u22121 (X \u2212 d)N \u22121 . Clearly \u03c40 gives an automorphism of the triple (P1 , L, s), hence\nlifts to an automorphism \u03c4 : C \u2192 C.\nMoreover, \u03c4 satisfies \u03c4 \u03c3\u03c4 \u22121 = \u03c3. Also we have that \u03c4 2 = \u03c3 j for some j \u2208 Z/N Z, because it induces\nthe identity on P1 . But 2 being invertible modulo N , we may write j = 2k, and then, changing \u03c4 into\n\u03c4 \u03c3 \u2212k if necessary, we can assume that \u03c4 2 = 1.\n6\n\n\fAs for \u03bc0 , things are slightly different because it exchanges a, c and b, d. Let s\u2032 be the section\n(X \u2212 c)(X \u2212 d)(X \u2212 a)N \u22121 (X \u2212 b)N \u22121 of L = O(\u22122), then \u03bc0 gives a map between (P1 , L, s) and\n(P1 , L, s\u2032 ). The last triple gives rise to the same curve C of course, but with the automorphism \u03c3 \u22121 . So\n\u03bc0 lifts to \u03bc : C \u2192 C such that \u03c3 \u22121 \u03bc = \u03bc\u03c3. As above, we may change \u03bc so as to have \u03bc2 = 1; then \u03bc\nand \u03c3 generate a group isomorphic to the dihedral group DN .\nProposition 2.1.4 C is hyperelliptic, and \u03c4 is the hyperelliptic involution.\nProof : Using the fact that N and 2 are coprime, it is immediate that a point in C is fixed by \u03c4 if and\nonly if its image in C/\u03c3 is fixed by \u03c40 . But the supports of the ramification loci for the quotients by \u03c4\nand \u03c3 (i.e. their fixed points) are disjoint, because their images in C/\u03c3 are already. Hence we get 2N\nfixed points for \u03c4 , namely all the preimages of the fixed points of \u03c40 . They form two \u03c3-orbits. Applying\nthe Riemann-Hurwitz formula to the quotient C \u2192 C/\u03c4 of degree 2:\n2(N \u2212 1) \u2212 2 = 2 (2gC/\u03c4 \u2212 2) + 2N\nwe have gC/\u03c4 = 0, as desired.\n\n\u0003\n\nProposition 2.1.5 Definitions 2.1 and 2.1.1 are equivalent.\nProof : It only remains to prove the implication \"2.1 \u21d2 2.1.1\". But once again, using oddness of N ,\na point in C is fixed by \u03c3 if and only if its image in C/\u03c4 is fixed by \u03c30 (the morphism induced from\n\u03c3), and then the stabilizers are equal. An automorphism of P1 of order N has two fixed points with full\nstabilizer, and ramification characters inverses to each other. As the ramification loci for \u03c3 and \u03c4 are\ndisjoint, the two points lifted in C give four fixed points with stabilizer G = Z/N Z as in 2.1.1, and with\nthe expected Hurwitz ramification datum.\n\u0003\n\nRemark 2.1.6 By the way, in [R], the definition chosen for Potts curves is a mix between ours: there,\nan N -Potts curve is a hyperelliptic curve of genus N \u2212 1, with an order N automorphism having exactly\n4 fixed points.\nAutomorphisms\nUsing the quotient by \u03c4 we can get another affine equation for a Potts curve C. As a matter of fact,\n\u03c3 induces on C/\u03c4 \u2243 P1 an automorphism conjugated to x 7\u2192 \u03b6x. The branch locus of \u03c4 is composed of\ntwo orbits of \u03c3, i.e. {\u03b6 j \u03b1} \u222a {\u03b6 j \u03b2} for 0 \u2264 j \u2264 N \u2212 1, for certain \u03b1, \u03b2 with \u03b1, \u03b2 and 0 all distinct. The\ncorresponding equation is\ny 2 = (xN \u2212 \u03b1N )(xN \u2212 \u03b2 N ) = x2N + AxN + B\n\n(2)\n\nWe can recover (1) \u221awith the choice of a rational parameter for the conic y 2 = u2 + Au + B (e.g. with the\nx\n\u2212A\n\u221a ). The automorphisms\n, the equation is tN = zz\u2212\u03bb\ncoordinates z = y+xN B and t = (2\u221aB)\n2 \u22121 with \u03bb =\n1/N\n2 B\n\u03c3, \u03c4, \u03bc have the following expressions on model (2) :\n\u03c3(x, y) = (\u03b6x, y)\n\n1/N\n\n; \u03c4 (x, y) = (x, \u2212y) ; \u03bc(x, y) = ( B x ,\n\nLet us define a modular invariant j =\n\nB\nA2 \u22124B\n\n\u221a\nBy\n)\nxN\n\n.\n\n6= 0 for a curve with equation (2). As is expected,\n\nProposition 2.1.7 Two Potts curves (C, \u03c3) and (C \u2032 , \u03c3 \u2032 ) of invariants j and j \u2032 are isomorphic if and\nonly if j = j \u2032 and [\u03c7] = [\u03c7\u2032 ].\nProof : Let \u03c6 : C \u2192 C \u2032 be an isomorphism with \u03c3 \u2032 \u03c6 = \u03c6\u03c3. It induces a map \u03c6\u0303 : C/\u03c4 \u2192 C \u2032 /\u03c4 \u2032 on the\nquotients. Moreover, proposition 1.2 says that for an automorphism of P1 of order prime to p, there is\na unique coordinate x on P1 (up to \u223c) such that the automorphism is a homothety. So if we consider\n7\n\n\fequations of type (2) for C and C \u2032 , then G-equivariance reads either \u03c6\u0303(\u03b6x) = \u03b6 \u03c6\u0303(x), or \u03c6\u0303(\u03b6x) = \u03b6 \u22121 \u03c6\u0303(x).\nIn the first case we find \u03c6\u0303(x) = \u03bbx for some \u03bb, whence A\u2032 = \u03bbN A, B \u2032 = \u03bb2N B and j = j \u2032 . In the second\ncase we find \u03c6\u0303(x) = \u03bb/x for some \u03bb, whence A\u2032 = \u03bbN A/B, B \u2032 = \u03bb2N /B and j = j \u2032 .\nConversely, assume that j = j \u2032 and [\u03c7] = [\u03c7\u2032 ] with C and C \u2032 given by an equation (2). Then \u03c7\u2032 =\neither \u03c7 or \u03c7\u22121 . If \u03c7\u2032 = \u03c7 choose \u03bb such that A\u2032 = \u03bbN A and B \u2032 = \u03bb2N B; then \u03c6 : (x, y) 7\u2192 (\u03bbx, \u03bbN y)\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u22121\n\u2032\nN\n\u2032\n2N\nis a G-isomorphism\n\u221a from CNto C . If \u03c7 = \u03c7 choose \u03bb such that A = \u03bb A/B and B = \u03bb /B; then\n\u0003\n\u03c6 : (x, y) 7\u2192 (\u03bb/x, B(\u03bb/x) y) answers the question.\nRemark 2.1.8 Via j, there is a 1-1 correspondance between isomorphism classes of N -Potts curves and\nthe sum of \u03c6(N )/2 copies of A1 \u2212 {0}. Indeed, for fixed [\u03c7] and j 6= 0, a curve with invariant j is given\nby the equation y 2 = x2N + (1 + 4j)xN + j(1 + 4j) if j 6= \u22121/4, or by y 2 = x2N \u2212 1 if j = \u22121/4.\nWe are now in position to compute the automorphism groups of Potts curves, using the results of\nsection 1. On the way, we provide a correction to [R], section 2, prop. 5 where the case of j = \u22121/4 was\nforgotten.\nTheorem 2.1.9 Let N > 3 be an odd integer, and k an algebraically closed field of characteristic p\nprime to 2N . Let (C, \u03c3) be an N -Potts curve. Then the automorphism group of the curve C (alone) is\nthe following:\nf4 , the representation group of S4 where the elements\n(i) If p 6= 3, 5, N = 3, j = \u22121/54, then Autk (C) = S\ncorresponding to transpositions have order 2, see [Su], ch. 3, \u00a72, (2.21).\n(ii) If p > 0, 2N \u2212 1 = q is a power of p, j = \u22121/4 (including the case N = 3, p = 5, j = \u22121/54), let\n\u00d7\nR \u2282 F\u00d7\nq2 be the subgroup of square roots of elements of Fq , then\nAutk (C) = PGL2 (Fq ) \u00d7F\u00d7 R\nq\n\n\u00d7\n\n(the product is fibered with respect to the determinant and the square map R \u2192 Fq ).\n\n(iii) In all other cases, if j 6= \u22121/4 then Autk (C) = (Z/2Z) \u00d7 DN , and if j = \u22121/4 then Autk (C) =\n(Z/2Z) \u00d7 D2N .\n\nProof : From now on we will denote by O\u0393 (x) the orbit of a point x under the action of a group \u0393,\nand \u0393x its stabilizer. We know that \u03c4 has order 2 and is normal in Aut(C) (because of the uniqueness\nof the hyperelliptic involution), hence it is central. Denote G = Aut(C)/ < \u03c4 > so that there is a central\nextension\n1 \u2192< \u03c4 >\u2192 Aut(C) \u2192 G \u2192 1\n(3)\nWhen f \u2208 Aut(C), f0 denotes its image in G. Denote by \u03a3 = O\u03c30 (\u03b1) \u222a O\u03c30 (\u03b2) the set of the 2N\nbranch points of \u03c4 , then by 2.1.3, G can be identified with the subgroup of Aut(P1 ) of the homographies\nstabilizing \u03a3. What we shall do is to determine G thanks to Dickson's list, and then find the class of the\ncorresponding extension.\nNotice that (Z/2Z) \u00d7 DN \u2243< \u03c4, \u03c3, \u03bc >\u2282 Aut(C) so that G contains a subgroup isomorphic to DN .\nAlso G acts transitively on \u03a3, because DN already does, and consequently\n\u2200s \u2208 \u03a3,\n\n2N = |OG (s)| = |G| / |Gs | .\n\nNow, in four steps we read through the list in Dickson's theorem to find all possible G's. Before, we\nobserve that we can allow conjugations of G in PGL2 (k) since it is just a change of variable on x in\nequation (2), so it does not change C up to isomorphism. That is why from step 2 on, we shall identify\nG with the representatives given in corollaries 1.7, 1.8, 1.9.\n1st step: the groups that can not appear.\nFirst of all, neither the cyclic groups nor A4 possess dihedral subgroups DN , so they are ruled out.\nNow, let us see that the occurence of G \u2243 A5 is also impossible. The only dihedral subgroups in G are D3\nand D5 , whence N = 3 or 5. Assume N = 3; then we must have Gs \u2243 D5 for some s \u2208 \u03a3, because it is a\n8\n\n\fsubgroup of A5 with 10 elements. Denote H :=< \u03c30 , \u03bc0 >\u2243 D3 ; then one can show that Gs \u2229 H \u2243 Z/2Z,\nand then there must be in H a non trivial automorphism with a fixed point in \u03a3. This is a contradiction.\nWhen N = 5, just interchange the roles of D3 and D5 (the former stands for Gs , the latter for H), and\nthe argument carries on. Also, note that this is true for any p (cases 1 and 3 of Dickson's theorem 1.1).\nFinally, a group of type Q \u22ca C (case 2) can not contain DN with (N, p) = 1.\n2nd step: the case of G = PSL2 (Fq ) or PGL2 (Fq ), q = ps .\nWe proceed in three substeps.\n(a) We show that \u03a3 coincides with the set of fixed points of order p elements of G. Let Q be a p-Sylow\nof the stabilizer G\u03b1 , it is also a p-Sylow of G. If g \u2208 G has order p, then it belongs to some p-Sylow\nQ\u2032 . All Sylow subgroups are conjugated in G, so Q\u2032 = tQt\u22121 and g fixes t(\u03b1) \u2208 \u03a3. Conversely, if s \u2208 \u03a3,\nthen Gs contains a p-Sylow of G, hence an element of order p. By cor. 1.6, \u03a3 = P1 (Fq ); in particular,\n2N = |\u03a3| = q + 1. In the sequel \u03c6 \u2208 Fq2 is a 2N -th root of unity such that \u03b6 = \u03c62 ; observe that \u03c6 + \u03c6\u22121\nand \u03b6 + \u03b6 \u22121 both belong to Fq .\n(b) We work out the curve and the group structure of Aut(C). By (a) we get the birational equation\n1\ny 2 = xq \u2212 x with genus q\u22121\n2 = N \u2212 1. Clearly PGL2 (Fq ) \u2286 G since it stabilizes P (Fq ). A priori G could\nbe bigger, however the only subgroups of PGL2 (k) containing PGL2 (Fq ) are isomorphic to PSL2 (Fq\u2032 ) or\nPGL2 (Fq\u2032 ), but then q \u2032 = 2N \u2212 1 = q and\nhence\nG = PGL2 (Fq ). In particular the group PSL2 (Fq ) is\n\u0013\n\u0012\nruled out. Moreover, for an element \u03b3 = ac db and \u03b4 such that \u03b4 2 = det(\u03b3), there is an automorphism\nf\u03b3,\u03b4 (x, y) =\n\nax + b\n\u03b4y\n,\ncx + d (cx + d) q+1\n2\n\n!\n\nThis is the fiber product structure stated in the theorem. We can now check that this is indeed a Potts\ncurve by giving an element of order N in PGL2 (Fq ). For this just consider the matrix M\u03b6 of 1.4.\n(c) At last we compute the invariant. In order to do this the quickest way is to notice that \u03a3 = P1 (Fq )\nis mapped to the 2N -th roots of unity via the following transformation\n\u03b3(x) =\n\n\u2212x + 1 + \u03b6 \u22121\nx\u22121\u2212\u03b6\n\nIndeed, u = \u221e maps to -1 and for u \u2208 Fq one has\n\u0012 q\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0012\n\u2212u + 1 + \u03b6 \u2212q\n\u2212u + 1 + \u03b6 \u22121\n2N\nq+1\n\u03b3(u) = \u03b3(u)\n=\n=1\nuq \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03b6 q\nu\u22121\u2212\u03b6\nusing that uq = u and \u03b6 q = \u03b6 \u22121 . With the new variable v = \u03b3(x) we get an equation\nw2 = v q+1 \u2212 1\nand the invariant is j = \u22121/4.\nx+1\n> (for N = 3, see corollary 1.8).\n3rd step: the case of G = S4 = < ix, x\u22121\n\u221a\nThis case can happen only if p 6= 3, cf theorem 1.1. Fix i a 8th root of unity and i its square. With\nthe notations of proposition 1.8, x 7\u2192 ix is \u03bd(1234) and x 7\u2192 x+1\nx\u22121 is \u03bd(12). Applying a permutation on\n{1, 2, 3, 4} if necessary, we identify \u03c30 and \u03bc0 with \u03bd(123) and \u03bd(12), respectively. For s \u2208 \u03a3, its stabilizer\nGs has cardinal 4, hence it is cyclic because two commuting involutions of P1 never have a common fixed\npoint. We can choose s so that Gs is generated by a0 (x) = ix.\nNow a0 can not have a single fixed point lying in \u03a3, because else it would act freely on \u03a3 \u2212 {s}, and\nhence its order would divide 2N \u2212 1 = 5. So the two fixed points {0, \u221e} are in \u03a3. The G-orbit of {0, \u221e}\nis {0, \u221e, \u00b11, \u00b1i} = \u03a3. We can now give an equation\n\ny 2 = x(x4 \u2212 1)\n9\n\n\fwith the automorphisms\n\u221a\na(x, y) = (ix, i y)\n\nx\u22121 2 2i y\n\u03c3(x, y) = (\u2212i x+1\n, (x+1)3 )\n\n2 2y\n\u03bc(x, y) = ( x+1\nx\u22121 , (x\u22121)3 )\n\n2 2y\n\u03bb(x, y) = (\u2212 x\u22121\nx+1 , (x+1)3 )\n\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\n\nAfter after \u221a\na conjugation changing \u03c30 into x 7\u2192 jx (j \u2208 \u03bc\u22173 ) we obtain the \"Potts\" equation y 2 =\n3\n(x \u2212 (2 + 3)3 )(x3 + 1). It allows to compute the invariant j = \u22121/54 but is less workable for the\ndetermination of the class of the extension (3). It can happen that G ) S4 only if G is PSL2 (Fq ) or\nPGL2 (Fq ), and we know that this implies q = 2N \u2212 1 = 5. When p = q = 5, we have \u22121/54 = \u22121/4,\nand according to what was done before, G = PGL2 (F5 ).\nNow let us check, refering to the definition in [Su], chap. 2, \u00a7 9, def. 9.10, that Aut(C) is a representation group of S4 . This is the last step to prove (i) in the theorem; as it is quite technical and not needed\nin the sequel we remain sketchy. We adopt the notations of [Su]. Denote H = Aut(C) and Z =< \u03c4 >.\nAssume L is a proper subgroup of H such that H = ZL, then [H : L] = 2, L \u2229 Z = 1, hence H = Z \u00d7 L\ndoes not contain any element of order 8, contradicting the existence of a. Furthermore, denote by M (G)\nthe Schur multiplier, then |Z| = |H \u2032 \u2229 Z| = 2 = |M (G)| by checking that \u03c4 = [\u03bc, \u03bb] is a commutator.\nThird, obviously, |H| = |G|.|M (G)|. Then the result follows by [Su], chap. 3, \u00a72, (2.21).\n1\nx\n\n>, \u03b5 \u2208 \u03bc\u2217M , for N |M , see corollary 1.7.\no\nn\nM \u22121\n. This has\nIt is the last possibility. For w \u2208 P1 its DM -orbit is w, \u03b5w, . . . , \u03b5M\u22121 w, w1 , . . . , \u03b5 w\n\u221a\ncardinal 2 if w = 0 or \u221e, 2M if w is in general position, and M if w is one of \u00b1 \u03b5j . We conclude that, in\ngeneral, M = N ; M = 2N occurs when the points of the orbit are vertices of a regular 2N -gon, yielding\n\u221a\nthe equation y 2 = x2N \u2212 1. The invariant is then j = \u22121/4, and \u03c30 has a \"root\" \u03c30 (x) = \u03b62N x.\n\u0003\n4th step: the dihedral case G = DM =< \u03b5x,\n\nCorollary 2.1.10 For all N, p, the group of automorphisms of (C, \u03c3) is:\nj 6= \u22121/4 :\nj = \u22121/4 :\n\nAutk (C, \u03c3) = (Z/2Z) \u00d7 (Z/N Z)\nAutk (C, \u03c3) = (Z/2Z) \u00d7 (Z/2N Z).\n\nProof : The only non-obvious case is (ii) of the theorem. We keep the notations of step 2 in the proof\nof the theorem. It suffices to check that the centralizer Z of \u03c30 in PGL2 (Fq ) is cyclic of order 2N . It is\ncyclic because, after a conjugation changing \u03c30 into x 7\u2192 \u03b6x, Z maps to a finite subgroup of Gm . It has\norder 6 2N = q + 1 by corollary 1.5, observing that \u03c30 is a power of a generator of Z. Finally it has\norder exactly 2N because there is in PGL2 (Fq ) an explicit square root for \u03c30 . Indeed, if \u03c30 is given as\nabove by the matrix M\u03b6 of 1.4, whose Cayley-Hamilton polynomial is X 2 \u2212 (\u03b6 + \u03b6 \u22121 )X + (\u03b6 + \u03b6 \u22121 ), one\nfinds that M\u03b6 + (\u03c6 + \u03c6\u22121 ) id has a square equal to M\u03b6 in PGL2 (Fq ).\n\u0003\n\n2.2\n\nWild case\n\nNow we study N -Potts curves when p|N . The ground field k is still assumed to be algebraically closed,\nof characteristic p > 0. Here it is definition 2.1 that applies: the ramification data of definition 2.1.1\ndo not make sense any more. As usual \u03c3 stands for the given automorphism of order N and \u03c4 is the\nhyperelliptic involution. Observe that if we have an isomorphism \u03c6 : C \u2192 C \u2032 between two Potts curves\nwith \u03c6\u03c3 = \u03c3 \u2032 \u03c6, then it follows from unicity of the hyperelliptic involution that we also have \u03c6\u03c4 = \u03c4 \u2032 \u03c6.\nAs a matter of fact it is not so clear that such curves exist. Let (C, \u03c3, \u03c4 ) be an N -Potts curve with\narbitrary N multiple of p. Then \u03c3 induces an automorphism of order N on the quotient C/\u03c4 \u2243 P1 . By\nproposition 1.2, the only possible case is\nN =p,\nand the induced automorphism \u03c30 is x 7\u2192 x + 1 up to conjugation. As in proposition 2.1.4, it is easy to\ncount 2p fixed points for the hyperelliptic involution \u03c4 , they form two orbits of \u03c3 (just lift the 2 fixed\npoints of the involution induced on C/\u03c3). The corresponding affine model is\ny 2 = (xp \u2212 x)2 + A(xp \u2212 x) + B\n10\n\n(A, B \u2208 k).\n\n(4)\n\n\fHence, there exist N -Potts curves with p|N exactly when N = p. In that case we define a modular\ninvariant by\n1\nj= 2\nA \u2212 4B\nProposition 2.2.1 Two p-Potts curves (C, \u03c3, \u03c4 ) and (C \u2032 , \u03c3 \u2032 , \u03c4 \u2032 ) of invariants j and j \u2032 are isomorphic if\nand only if j = j \u2032 .\nProof : Let \u03c6 : C \u2192 C \u2032 be an isomorphism with \u03c3 \u2032 \u03c6 = \u03c6\u03c3. It induces a map \u03c6\u0303 : C/\u03c4 \u2192 C \u2032 /\u03c4 \u2032 on the\nquotients. Moreover, again by 1.2 we can assume that both \u03c3 and \u03c3 \u2032 are x 7\u2192 x + 1. So if we consider\nequations of type (4) for C and C \u2032 , then G-equivariance reads \u03c6\u0303(x + 1) = \u03c6\u0303(x) + 1. From this we deduce\nthat A\u2032 = A + 2(tp \u2212 t) and B \u2032 = B + (tp \u2212 t)A + (tp \u2212 t)2 , and then j \u2032 = j.\nConversely if j \u2032 = j then the choice of a root t \u2208 k of tp \u2212 t = 21 (A\u2032 \u2212 A) satisfies also B \u2032 =\nB + (tp \u2212 t)A + (tp \u2212 t)2 . This ensures that \u03c6(x, y) = (x + t, y) defines an equivariant isomorphism\nbetween C and C \u2032 with equations (4).\n\u0003\n\nRemark 2.2.2 Here, contrary to the tame case (compare with 2.1.7) there is no numerical invariant\nsuch as [\u03c7] but only a continuous one. The computation of the moduli space in both cases will enlighten\nthis in the next sections.\nAt last we compute the automorphism group of p-Potts curves. Let (C, \u03c3, \u03c4 ) be given by equation (4).\nLet r, s be the roots of T 2 + AT + B, and \u03b1 (resp. \u03b2) a root of T p \u2212 T \u2212 r (resp. T p \u2212 T \u2212 s), so that (4)\nreads\np\u22121\np\u22121\nY\nY\n(x \u2212 \u03b2 + i) .\n(x \u2212 \u03b1 + i)\ny 2 = (xp \u2212 x \u2212 r)(xp \u2212 x \u2212 s) =\ni=0\n\ni=0\n\nWe have the following automorphisms:\n\n\u03c3(x, y) = (x + 1, y) ; \u03c4 (x, y) = (x, \u2212y)\n\n; \u03bc(x, y) = (\u03b1 + \u03b2 \u2212 x, y) .\n\nProposition 2.2.3 Let (C, \u03c3, \u03c4 ) be a p-Potts curve, then Autk (C) \u2243 (Z/2Z) \u00d7 Dp and Autk (C, \u03c3, \u03c4 ) \u2243\n(Z/2Z) \u00d7 (Z/pZ) .\nProof : It is still true (cf theorem 2.1.9) that\n(i) \u03c4 is of order 2, normal and central,\n(ii) G = Aut(C)/ < \u03c4 > is the subgroup of Aut(P1 ) of homographies stabilizing \u03a3 = O\u03c30 (\u03b1) \u222a O\u03c30 (\u03b2),\n\n(iii) Dp \u2282 G and 2p = [G : Gx ],\n\n\u2200x \u2208 \u03a3.\n\nLet Q be a p-Sylow of G containing \u03c30 ; by Dickson's theorem Q is elementary abelian. Assume that Q\nhas order more than p, then there exists \u03b8 \u2208 Q commuting with \u03c30 , hence \u03b8(x) = x + u, with u 6\u2208 Fp .\nMoreover \u03b8 stabilizes \u03a3, and exchanges the orbits O\u03c30 (\u03b1) and O\u03c30 (\u03b2) since u 6\u2208 Fp . Therefore\n\u001a\n\u03b1+u=\u03b2+i\n(\u2203i, j \u2208 Fp )\n\u03b2+u=\u03b1+j\nwhich implies u = i+j\n2 \u2208 Fp , a contradiction. Consequently Q =< \u03c30 >; we can now read through the\nlist in Dickson's theorem.\nIf G = PSL2 (Fp ) or PGL2 (Fp ), then G\u03b1 has order (p2 \u2212 1)/d with d = 2 or 4. This is prime to p,\nhence G\u03b1 est cyclic, but this contradicts corollary 1.5.\nThe only remaining possibility is G = Q \u22ca C =< \u03c30 > \u22ca < \u03c6 >, because A5 is ruled out by the same\narguments as in the case (N, p) = 1. The order of \u03c6, denoted 2m, is prime to p; changing the point \u03b1 in\nthe orbit if necessary, we can assume that its stabilizer is G\u03b1 =< \u03c62 >. As Q is normal, \u03c6\u22121 \u03c30 \u03c6 = \u03c30l\nfor some l \u2208 F\u2217p , from which we deduce that \u03c6(x) = l\u22121 x + b for some b \u2208 k. As \u03c62 fixes \u03b1, we derive\n(l2 \u2212 1)\u03b1 = l(l + 1)b. If l + 1 6= 0 it implies \u03c6(\u03b1) = l\u22121 \u03b1 + b = \u03b1; so l = \u22121, \u03c62 = 1 and m = 1.\n\u0003\n11\n\n\fWe see that the remarkable symmetry previously obtained when j = \u22121/4 does not occur here in\ncharacteristic p. In particular, this implies that the p-Potts curve in characteristic 0 with invariant\nj = \u22121/4 can not have good reduction in characteristic p, i.e. that any model of C over a discrete\nvaluation ring of residue characteristic p will have a singular special fibre.\n\n3\n\nThe stack PN when N is composite\n\nLet N > 3 be a non-prime integer. Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p 6= 2. We\nestablished in the previous section that whenever p is prime to N , there is a bijection between isomorphism\nclasses of N -Potts curves and a sum of \u03c6(N )/2 copies of the affine punctured line A1\u2217 := A1 \u2212 {0} over\nk (see 2.1.8). Furthermore when p divides N we saw in 2.2 that there are no Potts curves at all. We\n\u22121\n1\nnow show (th. 3.2.1) that the coarse moduli space of the stack PN is A1\u2217 \u2297 Z[ \u03b6+\u03b62 , 2N\n] (which indeed\nsplits as a disjoint sum over any field containing the N -th roots of unity). Here a couple of remarks are\nin order:\n(i) To be more precise, in all what follows, whenever we write Z[1/2, \u03b6] we mean the ring of cyclotomic\n\u22121\nintegers, and whenever we write Z[1/2, \u03b6+\u03b62 ], we mean its ring of invariants under \u03b6 7\u2192 \u03b6 \u22121 . In other\nwords, the former ring is Z[1/2][X]/\u03a6N and the latter is Z[1/2][X]/\u03c8N where \u03a6N and \u03c8N are the\ncyclotomic polynomials of 1.4.\n(ii) It will become clear while reading that everything in this section applies equally well to the tame\nstack Pp \u2297 Z[1/2p] when N = p is prime.\n\nAs an immediate consequence we have a result of good reduction (3.2.2). In 3.3, we compute the modular\nPicard group of the fibres of the stack PN . At last we determine topologically the stable curves that are\ninvolved as stable limits in the process of compactification of the moduli space of PN , in 3.4.\n\n3.1\n\nPreliminaries\n\nDefinition 3.1.1 Let S be a scheme over Z[1/2]. An N -Potts curve over S is a triple (C, \u03c3, \u03c4 ) composed\nof a smooth projective S-curve, and two automorphisms, \u03c3 : C \u2192 C of order p and \u03c4 : C \u2192 C of order\n2, such that the geometric fibers are Potts curves in the sense of definition 2.1.\nIt follows from standard arguments that the stack PN of N -Potts curves is a separated DeligneMumford stack over Z[1/2] (see [We] and [BR]). Also, as we saw in section 2, when N is invertible in the\nstructure sheaves of the base schemes, we might as well use :\nDefinition 3.1.2 Let Sbe a scheme over Z[1/2N ]. An N -Potts curve is a proper smooth morphism of\nschemes f : C \u2192 S, together with an S-automorphism \u03c3 : C \u2192 C of order N , such that the geometric\nfibers (Cs , \u03c3s ) are Potts curves in the sense of definition 2.1.1.\nThis gives a much better understanding of the stack, so we will work with this definition. Then let\nf : C \u2192 S be a Potts curve over S (remark: the type [\u03c7] is locally constant over S). We will need to\nrecover the following important fact that f : C \u2192 S is a hyperelliptic curve :\nLemma 3.1.3 There exists an involution \u03c4 : C \u2192 C such that f : C \u2192 S becomes a family of hyperelliptic curves (in the sense of [KL]).\nProof : Let G =< \u03c3 >. As C is projective over S, the quotient D = C/G exists; by smoothness the\nquotient map \u03c0 : C \u2192 D is finite flat of degree N . As N \u2208 O\u00d7\nS its formation commutes with base\nchange (see [KaMa], A7.1.3.4), as is also the case for the branch locus B = \u03c0\u2217 (C G ). In particular D is a\nP1 -bundle over S and B is \u00e9tale and finite of degree 4 over S. We may localize (in the \u00e9tale topology) as\nmuch as desired, because by unicity the hyperelliptic involution will exist globally.\nHence we may assume that S = Spec(R) is affine, that D = P1R , and B is a sum of four disjoint sections\n\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4. Write the sections as \u03b1 = (a1 : a2 ), . . . , \u03b4 = (d1 : d2 ). We define a linear transformation of D\nby the matrix\n\u0014\n\u0015\na1 b1 c2 d2 \u2212 c1 d1 a2 b2\na1 c1 d1 b2 + b1 c1 d1 a2 \u2212 a1 b1 c1 d2 \u2212 a1 b1 d1 c2\n\u03c40 =\n(a1 b2 + a2 b1 )c2 d2 \u2212 (c1 d2 + c2 d1 )a2 b2\n\u2212(a1 b1 c2 d2 \u2212 c1 d1 a2 b2 )\n12\n\n\f(we mimic the expression in the case where the base is a field). Its determinant det(\u03c40 ) = \u2212(a1 c2 \u2212\na2 c1 )(a1 d2 \u2212 a2 d1 )(b1 c2 \u2212 b2 c1 )(b1 d2 \u2212 b2 d1 ) is indeed invertible, as is clear fibrewise, and \u03c40 is involutive\nbecause of the vanishing of the trace (cf 1.3). We must now lift it to C. By 2.1.3 the cyclic covering\n\u03c0 : C \u2192 D = P1R is described by L \u2243 O(\u22122) and a global section s of LN , with LN \u2243 O(\u2212D) where\nD = \u03b1 + \u03b2 + (N \u2212 1)\u03b3 + (N \u2212 1)\u03b4. By construction \u03c40 respects the data (L, s), hence it lifts to an\nautomorphism \u03c4 of C with \u03c4 \u03c3 = \u03c3\u03c4 . As in the case of a single Potts curve, we can assume \u03c4 2 = id. This\ncompletes the proof.\n\u0003\n\n3.2\n\nThe moduli space\n\nWe now compute the moduli space of PN . The proof below will in fact give a concrete expression of\nPN as a quotient stack of an open subset in the affine 3-space of homogeneous polynomials of the form\nH(X, Z) = U X 2N + AX N Z N + BZ 2N by the action of the group (Gm )2 . The first Gm factor acts simply\n(and freely) by multiplication, and the second factor acts by \u03bb.H(X, Z) := H(\u03bbX, Z) (this is just the\nisomorphism relation between Potts curves, see proposition 2.1.7). This description is at least totally\ncorrect over an algebraically closed. Being rather interested in the arithmetic and reduction of the moduli\nspace, we will not insist on this aspect. Hence we will show :\nTheorem 3.2.1 The moduli space of PN is A1\u2217 \u2297 Z[ \u03b6+\u03b62\n\n\u22121\n\nTo avoid heavy notations we will write P for A1\u2217 \u2297 Z[ \u03b6+\u03b62\n\n1\n, 2N\n].\n\n\u22121\n\n1\n, 2N\n]. We split the proof into two steps :\n\n1st step: we build the morphism to the moduli space.\nHere again we will work \u00e9tale locally on S, and take care that the construction of the morphism is\ncanonical enough so that it descends. Notations are as above. By 3.1.3 there is an involution \u03c4 \u2208 AutS (C).\nThen E = C/\u03c4 is a P1 -bundle over S, we denote by r : C \u2192 E the natural projection and by q : E \u2192 S\nthe structure morphism. As \u03c3 commutes with \u03c4 it induces an automorphism of order N on E. The\ndivisor of fixed points T = E \u03c3 is an \u00e9tale cover of degree 2 of S, \u00e9tale locally it is a sum of two disjoint\nsections \u2206 + \u2206\u2032 . Choosing one of the two (say \u2206) defines an invertible sheaf O(\u2206) of degree 1. We may\ncall it O(1) and then E \u2243 P(V ) with V = q\u2217 O(1). By disjointness, if L and M are the restrictions of\nO(1) to \u2206 and \u2206\u2032 respectively (viewed as sheaves on S), then V splits as L \u2295 M . By construction the\naction of \u03c3 is now diagonal, given by multiplication by two invertible global sections s, t \u2208 \u0393(S, OS )\u00d7 .\nWe can normalize by changing V into V \u2297 L\u22121 , so that L = OS and s = 1. Then as \u03c3 has order N , t is\na primitive N -th root of unity.\nNow let us consider the double cover r : C \u2192 E. It is described by the decomposition r\u2217 OC = OE \u2295 L\nand by a \"Weierstrass\" section \u03b8 \u2208 \u0393(E, L\u22122 ), well determined up to an element of \u0393(E, O\u00d7\nE ) (see 2.1.3).\nSince L\u22121 has degree N on the fibres, we have L\u22121 \u2243 O(N ) \u2297 q \u2217 K for some K \u2208 Pic(S). Also as \u03b8|\u2206 is\neverywhere nonzero (the fixed loci for the actions of G and \u03c4 are disjoint fibrewise), by restriction to \u2206\nwe get K 2 \u2243 OS , hence L\u22122 \u2243 OE (2N ). Consequently we can identify \u03b8 with a \u03c3-invariant section of\n\u0393(E, OE (2N )) = \u0393(S, Sym2N (V )) =\n\n2N\nM\n\n\u0393(S, M j ) .\n\nj=0\n\nThe most convenient writing is to use global coordinates X, Z on P(V ), with say X corresponding to M .\nThen \u03b8 \u2208 \u0393(S, OS \u2295 M N \u2295 M 2N ), so \u03b8 \u221d H = U X 2N + AX N Z N + BZ 2N for some sections U, A, B of OS ,\nM N and M 2N respectively (recall that \u221d means equality up to an invertible element). Looking locally\non the fibers, one sees that U is invertible. Finally note that the smoothness of the fibres of C/S requires\nthat the section \u03b8 has no multiple zero (on all fibres). This means that neither B nor A2 \u2212 4U B vanish,\nUB\n\u2208 \u0393(S, OS )\u00d7 . The assignments F (\u03b6) = t and F (X) = j\nhence there is a well-defined section j = A2 \u22124UB\n1\ngive a map F : Z[\u03b6, 2N\n][X, X \u22121 ] \u2192 \u0393(S, OS )\u00d7 .\nNow we proceed to check the independance of this map with respect to the choices made. In fact\nthe only place where there is a different possibility is the choice of \u2206 rather than \u2206\u2032 . Choosing \u2206\u2032 is\n13\n\n\fequivalent to exchanging the coordinates X, Z on P(V ), so clearly j is unchanged. However t is changed\ninto t\u22121 ; so in any case if we set F (\u03b6 + \u03b6 \u22121 ) = t + t\u22121 then the map\nZ[\n\n\u0003\n\u03b6 + \u03b6 \u22121 1 \u0002\n,\n] X, X \u22121 \u2192 \u0393(S, OS )\u00d7\n2\n2N\n\nis independant of the choice. Eventually we have a map S \u2192 A1\u2217 \u2297 Z[ \u03b6+\u03b62\nconstruction is functorial, providing a morphism \u03a6 : PN \u2192 P .\n\n\u22121\n\n1\n, 2N\n] = P . It is clear that the\n\n2nd step: we check the properties of the moduli space.\nRecall that we must check two things: first, that for any geometric point Spec(k) \u2192 Spec(Z[1/2]), the\nmorphism \u03a6 induces a bijection between isomorphism classes in PN (k) and P (k). If the characteristic\nof k divides N then it is clear because both are empty, and else this is exactly 2.1.8 (observe that P \u2297 k\nsplits as \u03c6(N )/2 copies of A1\u2217 (k)). The second thing is to see that every map from PN to an algebraic\nspace factors through P . This can be done as in [MS], using a family whose classifying morphism S \u2192 P\nis finite surjective (such a family is sometimes called tautological ). For this we consider the one-parameter\n1\nfamily C0 with equation y 2 = x2N + \u03bbxN + 1, over the base S0 = Spec(Z[\u03b6, 2N\n][\u03bb, \u03bb21\u22124 ]). (This is of\ncourse only an affine smooth curve; to make the definition rigorous we actually glue C0 with another\ncopy of itself, compatibly with the maps to S0 , along the open set x 6= 0, via the isomorphism x\u2032 = 1/x,\ny \u2032 = y/xN ). The data of \u03b6 and of the invariant j0 = \u03bb21\u22124 determine a morphism S0 \u2192 P which we\ndenote by \u03a60 . Now let \u03a8 : PN \u2192 Q be a morphism of stacks to an algebraic space, and let \u03a80 : S0 \u2192 Q\nbe the morphism corresponding to \u03a8(C0 ); let \u0393 \u2282 P \u00d7 Q be the scheme-theoretic image of h = (\u03a60 , \u03a80 ).\nS0\n\u03a6\n\u271b\n\np2 \u2732\n\u2732 Q\n\u2732\n\nP\n\n\u2744\n\u0393\n\n\u03a80\n\n0\n\nh\n\n\u271b p1\n\nWe observe that, \u03a60 being finite and p1 separated, h is finite. In particular, h is closed, hence \u0393 = h(S0 )\nas sets. Second notice that \u0393 is integral because S0 is. Third p1 is closed and bijective: it is closed\nand surjective because \u03a60 is, and injective because for s, s\u2032 \u2208 S0 , \u03a60 (s) = \u03a60 (s\u2032 ) \u21d2 C0,s \u2243 C0,s\u2032 \u21d2\n\u03a80 (s) = \u03a80 (s\u2032 ) (Q being a space). Thus p1 is dominant, bijective and separable (since \u03a60 is), hence it\nis a birational map. At last, as P is normal, Zariski's Main Theorem states that p1 is an isomorphism.\nThen the composition p2 \u25e6 p1\u22121 : P \u2192 Q gives a morphism which factors \u03a8.\n\u0003\nOf course it must be said that P is not a fine moduli space. This is due to the presence of automorphisms; actually, in view of 2.1.10 we could get rid of the group (Z/2Z) \u00d7 (Z/N Z) by a process to be\nexplained in 5.1.1, but the extra automorphism when j = \u22121/4 still causes ramification of j above \u22121/4:\nj+\n\nA2\n1\n=\n4\n4(A2 \u2212 4B)\n\nA consequence of the explicit construction of the classifying morphism is that obviously reduction\nmodulo p can be done at any prime p > 2. The result is straightforward:\nTheorem 3.2.2 Assume that N > 3 is a composite integer and that p > 2 is a prime. Then the moduli\nspace of PN has good reduction at p, i.e. the moduli space of PN \u2297 Fp is the (possibly empty) fibre at Fp\nof the moduli space of PN .\n\u0003\n\n3.3\n\nThe Picard group\n\nLet k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p prime to 2N . We are now going to compute the\nPicard group of the geometric fibre PN \u2297 k. This will, in some sense, reveal that the geometry of the stack\n14\n\n\fcarries the dependance on N (whereas the subring of cyclotomic integers involved in the moduli space is\nof an arithmetic nature). Actually, as PN \u2297 k splits as a sum of isomorphic stacks (PN \u2297 k)[\u03c7] = PN,[\u03c7]\naccording to the classes of characters [\u03c7], we will compute the Picard group of one of them.\nWe first briefly recall the definitions. The \u00e9tale site of PN has as open sets the \u00e9tale morphisms\nu : U \u2192 PN from an algebraic space, denoted (U, u) or U . A map between two open sets U, V is a couple\n\u223c\n(f, \u03b1) with a morphism of algebraic spaces f : U \u2192 V and a 2-isomorphism \u03b1 : v \u25e6 f \u2212\u2192 u. Equivalently,\nit is a 2-commutative\n` triangle with vertices U, V, PN . Briefly said, the coverings of (U, u) are the \u00e9tale,\nsurjective families Ui \u2192 U , and the topology generated by all these is the \u00e9tale site (PN )\u00e9t . Finally\nan invertible sheaf L on (PN )\u00e9t is given by a collection of invertible sheaves L|U on U for every open set\n\u223c\nU \u2192 PN , and isomorphisms lf,\u03b1 : f \u2217 L|V \u2212\u2192 L|U for all maps as above between open sets, such that any\ncomposition\n(f,\u03b1)\n\n(g,\u03b2)\n\nU \u2212\u2192 V \u2212\u2192 W\ngives rise to an equality lg\u25e6f,\u03b1\u25e6f \u2217 \u03b2 = lf,\u03b1 \u25e6 f \u2217 lg,\u03b2 . The Picard group is the set of isomorphism classes of\ninvertible sheaves, endowed with the obvious tensor product.\nLemma 3.3.1 There is a morphism of groups \u03b2 : Pic(PN,[\u03c7] ) \u2192 Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/2N Z.\nProof : We define it as Mumford does in [Mu]. Let L be an invertible sheaf on PN,[\u03c7] and U \u2192 PN,[\u03c7]\nan open set, corresponding to an N -Potts curve (C, \u03c3, \u03c4 ) over U (we use definition 2.1). In terms of\nthe topology on PN,[\u03c7] , \u03c3 gives an automorphism of the open set U , so that there is an isomorphism\n\u223c\nlid,\u03c3 : L|U \u2212\u2192 L|U . It is given by an invertible global section of OU , and actually by the compatibility\nof L w.r.t composition this section is an N -th root of unity. Finally we get a morphism U \u2192 \u03bcN to the\nscheme \u03bcN of N -th roots of unity.\nIt is clear that for a connected U the image in \u03bcN is constant; it is even independant of the chosen\nopen set U , because the stack PN,[\u03c7] is irreducible, so two nonempty open sets (U, u) and (V, v) have\nimages that intersect in PN,[\u03c7] . In particular, if we choose U to be an atlas, one k-point x \u2208 U will give\nthe curve Cx with the extra automorphism \u03c30 whose square is \u03c3 (for the value \u22121/4 of the invariant).\nAs above, we then get a point in \u03bc2N , and obviously its square is the point in \u03bcN computed before.\nNow recall that a primitive N -th (resp. 2N -th) root of unity \u03b6 (resp. \u03c6 = \u2212\u03b6) is determined up to\ninversion by [\u03c7]. This yields an isomorphism \u03bc2N \u2243 Z/2N Z mapping \u03c6 to 1, hence for given L there is\na well-defined element \u03b22 (L) \u2208 Z/2N Z computed with any nonempty open set U . The same works with\nthe hyperelliptic involution \u03c4 ; in order to keep additive notation we define \u01eb = \u03b21 (L) \u2208 Z/2Z to be such\nthat lid,\u03c4 is the multiplication by (\u22121)\u01eb . This completes the definition of \u03b2 = (\u03b21 , \u03b22 ).\n\u0003\nAs noticed in the proof, \u03b2 is determined up to inversion of the generator in Z/2N Z. The following\nshould now be quite close to intuition:\nLemma 3.3.2 \u03b2 is surjective.\nProof : Let U \u2192 PN,[\u03c7] be an atlas, and (f : C \u2192 U, \u03c4, \u03c3) be the corresponding curve. It is tempting, as\nVN \u22121\nin [Mu], to evaluate \u03b2 on the Hodge bundle L =\nf\u2217 \u03a9C where \u03a9C is the sheaf of differential 1-forms.\nClearly we can compute \u03b2 on the fibre of L over a single point of U , and of course we choose a point\nx \u2208 U whose fibre is the curve Cx with an extra automorphism \u03c30 (for j = \u22121/4). Up to isomorphism Cx\nhas equation y 2 = x2N \u2212 1. The basis of \u0393(C, \u03a9C ) given by the forms \u03c9i = xi\u22121 dx\ny for 1 6 i 6 N \u2212 1, has\nthe virtue of diagonalizing the action of the group G \u2243 Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/2N Z generated by \u03c4 and \u03c30 . Indeed\n\u03c4 (\u03c9i ) =\n\u03c30 (\u03c9i ) =\n\n\u2212\u03c9i\n\u03c6i \u03c9i\n\nUnfortunately we see that \u03c30 maps \u03c91 \u2227 * * * \u2227 \u03c9N \u22121 to (\u22121)(N \u22121)/2 times itself (as does \u03c4 ) so we can not\nconclude. Thus taking maximal exterior power was too crude, but instead we can use the fact that f\u2217 \u03a9C\nis a G-sheaf, so\n\u22121\nf \u2217 \u03a9C = \u2295 N\ni=1 Li\n15\n\n\fwhere Li = ker(\u03c3 \u2217 \u2212 \u03c6i id) is an invertible sheaf. We obtain \u03b2(L1 ) = (1, 1) and \u03b2(L2 ) = (1, 2), that\ngenerate the image.\n\u0003\nThe end result is very similar to the one in the elliptic case (see [Mu]):\nTheorem 3.3.3 \u03b2 is injective, i.e. Pic((PN \u2297 k)[\u03c7] ) \u2243 (Z/2Z) \u00d7 (Z/2N Z).\nProof : Given an invertible sheaf L such that \u03b2(L) = 0, we show that L|U is trivial for any u : U \u2192 PN .\nLet f : C \u2192 U be the corresponding curve, and let us simplify the notations to P := PN,[\u03c7] and L := L|U .\nAs in [Mu] we will show that L \"descends\" to the moduli space P , but we will write down carefully the\nargument (only allusive in [Mu]) since it involves nonflat descent. Consider the diagram\np1\u2732\na\nb\nU \u00d7P U \u2732 U \u00d7P U \u2282\u2732 U \u00d7S U \u2732 U\np2\n\u223c\n\nLet qi := pi \u25e6 b \u25e6 a, then by definition of an invertible sheaf we have an isomorphism l : q1\u2217 L \u2212\u2192 q2\u2217 L\nbetween sheaves on U \u00d7P U . But the latter space is just I := Isom(p\u22171 C, p\u22172 C), finite and unramified over\nU \u00d7S U . By definition of the coarse moduli space, U \u00d7P U is the image of I in U \u00d7S U . So actually I is a\n\"torsor\" over U \u00d7P U , with structure group G = Aut((p1 \u25e6 b)\u2217 C). We must be careful that G is not flat,\nso the meaning of a torsor here is just that I \u00d7 I \u2243 G \u00d7 I. We have as usual an invariant pushforward\nG \u2217\naG\n\u2217 (pushing forward and then taking invariant sections) and it satisfies a\u2217 a F \u2243 F for any locally free\nsheaf F of finite rank on U \u00d7P U . Here flatness of G is indeed unnecessary, if F is locally free: using that\nboth I and G are affine over U \u00d7P U , we may locally reduce to the following situation of commutative\nalgebra. We have U \u00d7P U = Spec(A), I = Spec(B), G = Spec(A[G]) with a coaction B \u2192 A[G] \u2297 B such\nthat A = B G ; finally F is given by a free module M . It remains to check that (M \u2297A B)G = M which\nis clear since M is free.\n\u223c\nThe initial assumption that \u03b2(L) = 0 says exactly that l : q1\u2217 L \u2212\u2192 q2\u2217 L is a G-equivariant isomorphism,\n\u223c\n\u2217\n\u2217\nso applying aG\n\u2217 we obtain an isomorphism \u03c8 : (p1 \u25e6 b) L \u2212\u2192 (p2 \u25e6 b) L. Fortunately, the stack P as well\nas its moduli space P are smooth, therefore the map P \u2192 P is flat. Thus the map U \u2192 P is flat, and \u03c8\nis a descent datum for L. Finally Ldescends to P , so it is trivial since Pic(P ) = Pic(A1\u2217 \u2297 k) = 0.\n\u0003\n\n3.4\n\nCompactification by stable curves\n\nIt is known by the general theory of tame Hurwitz spaces that there exists a compactification PN for PN ,\nclassifying stable curves with action of G = Z/N Z. Let k an algebraically closed field of characteristic p\nprime to 2N like in the previous subsection; here we will just briefly find out the \"cusps\" of the geometric\nfibre PN,[\u03c7] = (PN \u2297 k)[\u03c7] , i.e. the points of the boundary.\nWe refer to [BR] for a precise definition of PN ; we will only need to know that there is a so-called\n\"discriminant\" morphism\n\u03b4 : PN,[\u03c7] \u2192 M0,(2,2)\nwith values in the stack of curves of genus 0 with four marked points gathered by pairs. This morphism\nmaps a Potts curve C to the quotient C/G marked by the branch points.\nRecall the data G = Z/N Z, g = N \u2212 1 and \u03be = {\u03c7, \u03c7, \u03c7\u22121 , \u03c7\u22121 } of definition 2.1.1. In order to\ndetermine combinatorially the stable curves lying on the boundary \u2202PN,[\u03c7] we use the combinatorial\ndescription of stable curves via their dual graph \u0393, as in [DM], [BR]. For a stable curve C, the graph \u0393C\nhas the irreducible components of Cas vertices, and the double points as edges.\nProposition 3.4.1 The coarse moduli space of PN,[\u03c7] is P = P1 \u2297 k, and the two cusps are topologically\nthe following two curves. The first has 2 branches isomorphic to P1 intersecting N times, and the second\nhas 2 branches of genus N2\u22121 intersecting in only one point.\n16\n\n\fProof : First, P is a normal proper curve of genus zero, hence it is P1 . In dual graphs, we shall indicate\nmarked points by wavy edges. Hence let (C,\nP G) be a stable Potts curve. We have \u0393\u03a3 = \u0393C /G, where\n\u03a3 = C/G has genus 0. We recall that g \u2032 = i g\u03a3i + h1 (\u0393\u03a3 ), so that the irreducible components \u03a3i of \u03a3\nare all rational, and that \u0393\u03a3 is a (connected) tree. Taking into account the four marked points and the\nstability conditions, \u0393\u03a3 must be one of the two graphs:\n\nBut, G being cyclic, a double point in C maps to a double point in \u03a3. Hence the first graph can not\noccur. So let Ci , i = 1, 2, be irreducible components of C above each of the components \u03a3i of \u03a3, and\nintersecting at a point x. The stabilizer of x is H = Gx , and h = [G : H] is its index. Take a \u2208 C1\na (smooth) ramification point; the stabilizer of C1 is G1 = G because by assumption G = Ga \u2282 G1 .\nSimilarly G2 = G, thus C has only two irreducible components.\nNow let us write the Riemann-Hurwitz formula for the quotient maps \u03c0|Ci : Ci \u2192 Ci /Gi \u2243 \u03a3i \u2243 P1 .\nThere is only one orbit of double points, therefore their number is [G : Gx ] = h:\n2gi \u2212 2 = N (\u22122) + 2(N \u2212 1) + h(N \u2212 h) = h(N \u2212 h) \u2212 2,\n| {z } | {z }\n(r)\n\n\u2200i = 1, 2.\n\n(d)\n\nwhere (r) is the contribution of the ramification points, and (d) the contribution of the double points.\nIn particular g1 = g2 , and we also know that g(C) = N \u2212 1 = g1 + g2 + h1 (\u0393C ) = g1 + g2 + h \u2212 1. So,\nh(N \u2212 h) = 2g1 = N \u2212 h, whence h = N or 1.\nLetting the family y 2 = x2N + 2xN + t degenerate when t \u2192 1, we get y 2 = (xN + 1)2 . In this way we\nsee that the first cusp described above is the Potts curve of invariant j = \u221e. Moreover, it is obvious that\nthere is only one (isomorphism class of) Potts curve with this combinatorial aspect. A similar description\nwith equations for the other cusp would be more tricky. However, since we know that the other cusp can\nnot have the same combinatorics, we necessarily get the second picture for j = 0.\n\u0003\n\n4\n\nModuli space of Pp\n\nTheorem 4.1 The moduli space of Pp is A1\u2217 \u2297 Z[ \u03b6+\u03b62\n\n\u22121\n\n, 12 ].\n\nThe rest of this section is devoted to the proof of the theorem. We keep the former scheme of\nproof in two steps, but the complication coming from wild ramification implies that we won't be able to\n\"normalize\" the construction as well as before. Because of this we will need two additional lemmas. In\nthe first, which we now state, it is only for later convenience that a primitive root of unity is denoted by\nt instead of \u03b6.\nLemma 4.2 Let t, \u03c8 be elements of a ring A, note t[0] = 0 and t[i] = 1 + t + * * * + ti\u22121 for i > 1.\nLet \u03c3 be the endomorphism of the graded polynomial A-algebra A[X, Z] given by \u03c3(X) = tX + \u03c8Z and\n\u03c3(Z) = Z. Then \u03c3 has exact order p after any base change A \u2192 A\u2032 if and only if 1 + t + * * * + tp\u22121 = 0\nand (t \u2212 1, \u03c8) = A. If this is so then the algebra of invariants A[X, Z]\u03c3 is generated by Z and the norm\nN (X, Z) =\n\np\u22121\nY\n\ni\n\n\u03c3 (X) =\n\np\u22121\nY\ni=0\n\ni=0\n\n17\n\n(X \u2212 t[i] \u03c8Z)\n\n\fProof : It is clear that Z plays no role, so we can dehomogenize and make Z = 1. Clearly, \u03c3 p = id \u21d4\ntp = 1 and (1 + t + * * * + tp\u22121 )\u03c8 = 0. Now let A\u2032 run through all residue fields \u03ba of A. Whenever\nt = 1 in \u03ba, the fact that \u03c3 has exact order p on the corresponding fibre implies \u03c8 6= 0. This means that\n(t \u2212 1, \u03c8) = A, hence 1 = u(t \u2212 1) + v\u03c8 for some u, v. From this we deduce that 1 + t + * * * + tp\u22121 = 0.\nConversely this is easily seen to imply that \u03c3 has exact order p \"universally\".\nAs for the invariants we always have A[N (X)] \u2282 A[X]\u03c3 . It is that we have equality when A is a field.\nIn the general case, let M be the cokernel of the inclusion, it is a finite A-module. The crucial point\nis that, as the action is faithful fibrewise, the formation of A[X]\u03c3 commutes with base change (this is a\nspecial case of results concerning actions on smooth curves, see [BM2], prop. 3.7). So for every residue\nfield we have M \u2297 \u03ba = 0. By Nakayama's lemma, it follows that M = 0.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.3 We recall that for a p-Potts curve (C, \u03c3, \u03c4 ) over an algebraically closed field, there are 2\nfixed points in C for the action of \u03c3, and each has conductor m = 1. This follows from the description\nmade in 2.2.\n1st step: we build the morphism to the moduli space.\nHere we keep the notations of the proof of 3.2.1. Let (f : C \u2192 S, \u03c3, \u03c4 ) be a p-Potts curve over S in\nq\nr\ncharacteristic p. Let C \u2192 E \u2192 S be the factorization of f through the quotient by \u03c4 . Then \u03c3 induces an\nautomorphism of order p of E, still denoted \u03c3. By the remarks above, the divisor of fixed points T = E \u03c3 ,\nfinite of degree 2, is no longer \u00e9tale but nevertheless fppf over S. In fact, locally for the fppf topology\nit is a sum of two disjoint sections \u2206 + \u2206\u2032 , and above S \u2297 Fp these sections have the same support but\ninfinitesimally they might be distinct (see below).\nFrom now on we work with the section \u2206. Choosing O(1) := O(\u2206), we set V := q\u2217 O(1) so E = P(V ).\nThe section corresponding to \u2206 gives a surjective map h : V \u2192 M = O(1)|\u2206 , and unfortunately here we\n\u2228\n\u2228\ncan not go further to split the bundle. But ker(h) is known to be N\u2206\n\u2297 M , with N\u2206\nthe conormal sheaf\nof \u2206 in E: to see this, remember the fundamental exact sequence\n0 \u2192 \u03a91P(V )/S (1) \u2192 q \u2217 V \u2192 O(1) \u2192 0\n\u2228\nand restrict to \u2206. Now N\u2206\n\u2243 O(\u2212\u2206)|\u2206 \u2243 O(\u22121)|\u2206 , so that ker(h) \u2243 OS . Hence we have an extension\n\n0 \u2192 OS \u2192 V \u2192 M \u2192 0\nLet us see now how \u03c3 acts on this. As an automorphism of E, it pulls back O(1) to an invertible sheaf\nof degree 1, i.e. there is an isomorphism u\u03c3 : \u03c3 \u2217 O(1) \u2243 q \u2217 K \u2297 O(1) for some K \u2208 Pic(S). Moreover \u03c3\nis the identity on \u2206, so that restricting u\u03c3 to \u2206 shows that K is trivial. Now \u03c3 is given by a surjective\nmorphism of sheaves\nu\u03c3\nq \u2217 V \u2192 \u03c3 \u2217 O(1) \u2243 O(1)\nTaking direct images by q, we obtain an automorphism \u03c6\u03c3 : V \u2192 V . This map induces an automorphism\nof M and of ker(h) \u2243 OS , and is well determined up to an invertible global section of OS , but requiring\n\u03c6\u03c3 |OS = id makes \u03c6\u03c3 canonical. Now the action on M is given by multiplication by a global section\nt \u2208 \u0393(S, O\u00d7\nS ), this means that if we choose locally a coordinate X for M as in the proof of 3.2.1, the\naction is\n\u03c6\u03c3 (X) = tX + \u03c8Z (for some \u03c8 \u2208 \u0393(M, OS ))\n\u03c6\u03c3 (Z) = Z\nAs \u03c3 has order p on the fibres, we have 1 + t + * * * + tp\u22121 = 0, and t \u2212 1 and \u03c8 generate OS , by lemma 4.2.\nIn particular, denoting by \u03c9 = t[1] . . . t[p\u22121] we have p = \u03c9(t \u2212 1)p\u22121 (notations of lemma 4.2).\nThe double cover r is described by the decomposition r\u2217 OC = OE \u2295 L and by a section \u03b8 \u2208 \u0393(E, L\u22122 ),\n\u22122\nwell determined up to an element of \u0393(E, O\u00d7\n\u2243 OE (2p), so we can identify \u03b8 with a \u03c3E ). Also, L\nj\n2N\ninvariant section of \u0393(E, OE (2p)) = \u2295j=0 \u0393(S, M ). By lemma 4.2 we get\n\u03b8 \u221d H = U N (X, Z)2 + AN (X, Z)Z p + BZ 2p\n18\n\n\ffor some sections U, A, B of OS , M p , M 2p . As in the proof of 3.2.1 we see that U is invertible. Now we\nmust express that the fibres of C/S are smooth, i.e. that \u03b8 has no multiple zero. To this aim we compute\nits discriminant, it turns out that\nRes(H, H \u2032 ) = \u2212U p \u03c9 2p \u03b4 p\u22121 (A2 \u2212 4BU )p\nwhere \u03b4 := H(\u2212\u03c8, t \u2212 1) = U \u03c8 2p \u2212 A\u03c8 p (t \u2212 1)p + B(t \u2212 1)2p and we recall that \u03c9 = t[1] . . . t[p\u22121] . In this\nexpression both U and \u03c9 are invertible. So the smoothness condition is that Res(H, H \u2032 ), or equivalentlty\n\u03b4(A2 \u2212 4U B), is invertible (remark : this contains the condition that t \u2212 1 and \u03c8 generate OS ). We are\nled to define\nU (U \u03c8 2p \u2212 A\u03c8 p (t \u2212 1)p + B(t \u2212 1)2p )\nj=\nA2 \u2212 4U B\n\n2p\nIt lies in \u0393(S, O\u00d7\nS ) because numerator and denominator are invertible sections of M . Also it is independant of the leading coefficient of H. If our invariant were merely the discriminant of H then, being\nintrisic, it would be obviously invariant under changes of variables. Here this is not the case, so we will\nproceed to check this in the form of a lemma.\n\nLemma 4.4 The definition of j is independant of the choice of coordinate X, Z and of the choice of\nsection \u2206.\nProof : From now on we always normalize the expressions by setting U = 1. First, in the choice of the\ncoordinate system the only loose variable is X so we can assume that Z \u2032 = Z and X \u2032 = \u03b1X + \u03b2Z. Then\n\u03c3(X \u2032 ) = tX \u2032 + \u03c8 \u2032 where \u03c8 \u2032 = \u03b1\u03c8 \u2212 (t \u2212 1)\u03b2. The norm N \u2032 (X \u2032 , Z \u2032 ) with t\u2032 = t and \u03c8 \u2032 is\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nN (X , Z ) =\n\np\u22121\nY\ni=0\n\n\u2032\n\n[i]\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n(X \u2212 t \u03c8 Z ) =\n\np\u22121\nY\ni=0\n\n(\u03b1X + \u03b2Z \u2212 t[i] \u03c8 \u2032 Z)\n\nBeing \u03c6\u03c3 -invariant, this is a polynomial in N and Z p , hence there exists \u03be such that N \u2032 (X \u2032 , Z \u2032 ) =\n\u03b1p N (X, Z) + \u03beZ p . The polynomial H \u2032 = N \u2032 (X \u2032 , Z \u2032 )2 + A\u2032 N \u2032 (X \u2032 , Z \u2032 )Z \u2032p + B \u2032 Z \u20322p associated to \u03b8 can be\nexpressed in terms of N (X, Z) and Z p (here H \u2032 is not the derivative of H !). As the change of variables\n(N, Z p ) \u2194 (N \u2032 , Z \u2032p ) has determinant \u03b1p , the discriminant of H \u2032 viewed as a polynomial of degree 2 in\n(N, Z p ) is \u03b12p (A\u20322 \u2212 4B \u2032 ). Of course since H \u221d H \u2032 we have H \u2032 = \u03b12p H. Computing discriminants gives\n\u03b12p (A\u20322 \u2212 4B \u2032 ) = \u03b14p (A2 \u2212 4B). Then substituting (X, Z) = (\u2212\u03c8, t \u2212 1), first in N \u2032 = \u03b1p N + \u03beZ p , second\nin H \u2032 = \u03b12p H, gives \u03b4 \u2032 = \u03b12p \u03b4. Finally j \u2032 = \u03b4 \u2032 /(A\u20322 \u2212 4B \u2032 ) = \u03b4/(A2 \u2212 4B) = j.\nNow, assume that we choose the section \u2206\u2032 instead of \u2206. It is not as obvious as in 3.2.1 that formally\nthis has the effect of changing t to t\u22121 , and not even that the invariant will not change; so we sketch the\ndetails. The equation of \u2206\u2032 is given by the new coordinate Z \u2032 = \u03c6\u03c3 (X) \u2212 X = (t \u2212 1)X + \u03c8Z. As we\nsaw just above, we can choose X \u2032 as we like; to simplify matters we recall that there exist sections u, v\nsuch that u(t \u2212 1) + v\u03c8 = 1 and we choose X \u2032 = vX \u2212 uZ so as to have a unimodular change of variables\n\u001a \u2032\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u001b\nX = vX \u2212 uZ\nX = \u03c8X \u2032 + uZ \u2032\n\u21d4\nZ \u2032 = (t \u2212 1)X + \u03c8Z\nZ = \u2212(t \u2212 1)X \u2032 + vZ \u2032\nThen we have \u03c6\u03c3 (X \u2032 ) = X \u2032 + vZ \u2032 and \u03c6\u03c3 (Z \u2032 ) = tZ \u2032 . The condition that \u03c6\u03c3 acts trivially on Z \u2032 leads to\nconsider \u03c6\u2032\u03c3 = t\u22121 \u03c6\u03c3 , and we obtain\n\u03c6\u2032\u03c3 (X \u2032 ) = t\u22121 (X \u2032 + vZ \u2032 )\n\u03c6\u2032\u03c3 (Z \u2032 ) = Z \u2032\nWith t\u2032 = t\u22121 and \u03c8 \u2032 = t\u22121 v, the norm is N \u2032 (X \u2032 , Z \u2032 ) =\n\u2212(t\u22121 )[i] t\u22121 = t[p\u2212i] we compute\nN \u2032 (X \u2032 , Z \u2032 ) =\n\np\u22121\nY\ni=0\n\nQp\u22121\n\ni=0 (X\n\n(vX \u2212 uZ \u2212 t[i] Z)\n\n19\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2212 (t\u22121 )[i] t\u22121 vZ \u2032 ). Using that\n\n\fwhich is \u03c6\u03c3 -invariant, so there exists \u03be such that N \u2032 (X \u2032 , Z \u2032 ) = v p N (X, Z) + \u03beZ p . Substituting (X, Z) =\n(\u2212\u03c8, t \u2212 1) yields immediately \u22121 = \u2212v p \u03c8 p + (t \u2212 1)p \u03be, so the change of variables between the invariants\nof degree p is unimodular :\n\u001a \u2032p\nZ = \u03c8 p Z p + (t \u2212 1)p N (X, Z)\nN \u2032 (X \u2032 , Z \u2032 ) = \u03beZ p + v p N (X, Z)\nThus for H \u2032 = N \u2032 (X \u2032 , Z \u2032 )2 + A\u2032 N \u2032 (X \u2032 , Z \u2032 )Z \u2032p + B \u2032 Z \u20322p , its discriminant as a polynomial of degree 2\nin (N, Z p ) is still A\u20322 \u2212 4B \u2032 . Now, when expressed in terms of (N, Z p ) the polynomial H \u2032 has leading\ncoefficient \u03b4 \u2032 = H \u2032 (\u2212t\u22121 v, t\u22121 \u22121), so H \u2032 = \u03b4 \u2032 H. Computing discriminants gives A\u20322 \u22124B \u2032 = \u03b4 \u20322 (A2 \u22124B),\nand substituting (X, Z) = (\u2212\u03c8, t \u2212 1) gives 1 = \u03b4 \u2032 \u03b4, so here again j \u2032 = j.\n\u0003\nTherefore the only change is that having chosen \u2206\u2032 instead of \u2206, we recover t\u22121 instead of t as a p-th\nroot of unity. So we have a well-defined map\nZ[\n\n\u0003\n\u03b6 + \u03b6 \u22121 1 \u0002\n, ] X, X \u22121 \u2192 \u0393(S, OS )\u00d7\n2\n2\n\n\u22121\n\nif we set F (\u03b6 + \u03b6 \u22121 ) = t + t\u22121 and F (X) = j. Eventually we have a map S \u2192 A1\u2217 \u2297 Z[ \u03b6+\u03b62 , 12 ] = P . In\nfact we completed the construction after base change to T = E \u03c3 , but the construction being canonical,\nby fppf descent we obtain a morphism defined on S. It is clear that the construction is functorial in S,\nproviding a morphism \u03a6 : Pp \u2192 P .\n2nd step: we check the properties of a moduli space.\nHere, provided we give a family of Potts curves with a finite, surjective associated morphism to\nthe moduli\narguments of the proof of 3.2.1 carry on. We consider the norm for \u03c8 = 1,\nQ space, the\n[i]\nN (x) = p\u22121\n(x\n\u2212\n\u03b6\n)\nand the curve with equation y 2 = N (x)2 + \u03bbN (x) + 1, with invariant j0 (\u03bb) =\ni=0\n1\u2212\u03bb(\u03b6\u22121)p +(\u03b6\u22121)2p\n,\n\u03bb2 \u22124\n\nover the base\n\n\u0012\n\u0015\u0013\n\u0014\n1\n1\nS0 = Spec Z[\u03b6, ] \u03bb, j0 (\u03bb),\n2\nj0 (\u03bb)\n\nAs in the proof of 3.2.1, to be rigorous we can easily give another smooth affine part for this curve, but\nwe omit this detail. Then the proof of 3.2.1 works similarly, ending the proof of th. 4.1.\n\u0003\n\n5\n\nThe fibre of Pp at the prime p\n\nAt last we study the stack of p-Potts curves in characteristic p, that is to say Pp \u2297 Fp . First we compute\nits moduli space, along the same lines as above; the main difficulty here is that this space is not normal\nanymore, so we need the help of deformation theory as well as the operation of \"2-quotient\" of an algebraic\nstack (see [Ro], [AbV]). The result shows that the moduli space of the Z[1/2]-stack Pp has good reduction\nat p. Then, we compute the Picard group of Pp \u2297 Fp .\n\n5.1\n\nModuli space in characteristic p\n\nWe still assume that p > 3. Before we state the theorem, let us consider the problem of constructing the\nmoduli space of the stack Pp \u2297 Fp along the same lines as above (section 4). In the first step of the proof\nof 4.1 nothing needs any change (except perhaps the fact that \u03c8 can be chosen to be equal to 1; this\nmakes the computations slightly simpler but is anecdotical). We obtain a classifying morphism \u03a6 from\n\u22121\n\u22121\nPp to P = A1\u2217 \u2297 Fp [ \u03b6+\u03b62 ]. Here, throughout the construction, \u03b6+\u03b62 is still a root of the polynomial \u03c8p\nof 1.4, which is none other than the polynomial \u03c8 of [BM1], 4.2.5 and 4.2.6. In characteristic p we simply\nFp [z]\n.\nhave \u03c8(X) = X (p\u22121)/2 , so P = A1\u2217 \u2297 z(p\u22121)/2\nThe difference comes with the 2nd step where we must check the properties of a moduli space. The\nproblem is that P is not a normal scheme anymore, so we will have to use a different strategy. One\n20\n\n\fingredient will be the \"2-quotient\" of an algebraic stack whose objects all possess a fixed finite group\ninside their automorphism group. Here is a brief summary of its properties ([Ro], chap. I, prop. 3.0.2 or\n[AbV], prop. 3.5.1):\nProposition 5.1.1 Let S be a scheme and M an algebraic stack over S. Let G be a finite group,\nassume that for every object x \u2208 M(T ) there is an injection ix : GT \u0592\u2192 AutT (x), whose formation is\ncompatible with cartesian diagrams (see [Ro]). Then there exists an algebraic stack M//G and a map\nf : M \u2192 M//G, such that f maps the elements of G to the identity, and is universal with respect to this\nproperty. The geometric points of M//G are the same as those of M, but for x such a point we have\nAutM//G (x) = AutM (x)/G. The formation of M//G commutes with base change on S. Moreover, f is an\n\u00e9tale gerbe. The stack M//G has a coarse moduli space if and only if M has one, and if this is the case\nthe moduli spaces are the same. Finally, if M is separated or proper, then M//G has the same properties.\n\u0003\n\nA basic example of this is given by the classifying stack BG of a finite abelian group G over a scheme\nS. Its objects are G-torsors, and G lies in all automorphism groups. In this case M = BG, and M//G = S.\nNow let us come back to the stack Pp \u2297 Fp . We are going to show :\nTheorem 5.1.2 If G = Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/pZ, then we have an isomorphism\n\u223c\n\n(Pp \u2297 Fp )//G \u2212\u2192 A1\u2217 \u2297\nIn particular, A1\u2217 \u2297\n\nFp [z]\nz (p\u22121)/2\n\nFp [z]\nz (p\u22121)/2\n\nis the coarse moduli space of Pp \u2297 Fp .\n\nFrom proposition 2.2.3 we know that p-Potts curves (over any base S/k) have the constant group\nscheme G = Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/pZ as their automorphism group (use non-ramification of AutS (C, \u03c3, \u03c4 )). Hence\nby definition of the 2-quotient the morphism \u03a6 factors through\n\u03a8 : (Pp \u2297 Fp )//G \u2192 A1\u2217 \u2297\n\nFp [z]\nz (p\u22121)/2\n\nwith the stack Q := Pp \u2297Fp //G representable by an algebraic space ([L-MB], 8.1.1). Thanks to deformation\ntheory, known from [BM1], we shall show that \u03a8 is \u00e9tale :\nProposition 5.1.3 Let (C, \u03c3, \u03c4 ) be a p-Potts curve over k. Then the ring that prorepresents the functor\nFp [z]\n[[t]].\nof deformations of C to local, artinian k-algebras is z(p\u22121)/2\nProof : This is an example of the computation of deformations of Z/pZ-actions on smooth curves by\nBertin and M\u00e9zard [BM1]. In their work everything is done over an algebraically closed field, as is usual\nin arithmetic geometry in mixed characteristic, but one can check that this assumption is not necessary\nin their article. Indeed the results they use are Schlessinger's criteria that need no assumption on the\nbase field, and Serre's Corps Locaux that uses perfect fields. So their results are valid over Fp .\nNow, as \u03c4 has order 2 which is assumed to be prime to p, the deformation ring of (C, \u03c3, \u03c4 ) is the\ndeformation ring of (D = C/\u03c4, \u03c3) (we still denote \u03c3 the automorphism induced on C/\u03c4 ). We first look\nat deformations of (D, \u03c3) to algebras over the ring of Witt vectors W (Fp ), like in [BM1]. In the article,\ncorollary 3.3.5 shows that the universal deformation ring of (D, \u03c3) is\nb . . . \u2297R\nb r )[[U1 , . . . , UN ]]\nRgl = (R1 \u2297\n\nwith N = dimk H 1 (D/\u03c3, \u03c0\u2217\u03c3 (TD )). Here there is only r = 1 orbit of fixed points, with conductor m = 1\n(see remark 4.3). Also R1 = W (Fp )[[X]]/\u03c8(X) by [BM1], theorem 4.2.8. Finally, the computation of\nN is done in the course of the proof of theorem 4.2.8, namely N = 1. Reducing modulo p, we have\nFp [z]\nFp [z]\n. We obtain the universal ring for deformations to k-algebras as z(p\u22121)/2\n[[u]].\n\u0003\nR1 /pR1 = z(p\u22121)/2\nEnd of proof of theorem 5.1.2 : As the 2-quotient Pp \u2297Fp \u2192 Q is \u00e9tale, it follows from the proposition\nthat the extensions of complete local rings corresponding to \u03a8 are trivial, meaning that both \u03a6 and \u03a8 are\n21\n\n\f\u00e9tale. A first consequence is that Q is not only an algebraic space, but in fact a scheme. Also, considering\nthe scheme Q\u2032 defined by the fibre square:\nQ\u2032\n\nu\u2032 \u2732 1\nA\u2217 \u2297 k\n\n\u2744\n\u2744 u\nFp [z]\nQ \u2732 A1\u2217 \u2297 (p\u22121)/2\nz\nwe have that u\u2032 is \u00e9tale, hence Q\u2032 reduced. Moreover u\u2032 is bijective, so by Zariski's Main Theorem for\nschemes u\u2032 is an isomorphism. So Qred = Q\u2032 is affine, which implies that Q itself is. Now using [SGA1],\nExp. I, th. 6.1 we get that u is an isomorphism.\n\u0003\n\n5.2\n\nThe Picard group of Pp \u2297 Fp\n\nLet k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p 6= 2 (actually the assumption of algebraic closure\nk[z]\n1\n] its ring of functions.\nwill not be necessary). Let P be the moduli space of Pp \u2297 k and A = z(p\u22121)/2\n[X, X\nThe adaptation of the arguments of 3.3 gives the following result :\nTheorem 5.2.1 There is an isomorphism Pic(Pp \u2297 k) \u2243 Z/2Z \u00d7 (1 + zA) where 1 + zA is a subgroup of\nthe multiplicative group of invertible elements in A.\nProof : Put P := Pp \u2297 k. Let U \u2192 P an open set of the \u00e9tale site of Pp , corresponding to a p-Potts curve\n(C, \u03c3, \u03c4 ) over U . We know that AutU (C, \u03c3, \u03c4 ) is the constant group scheme G = Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/pZ. Then, as\n\u223c\nin 3.3.1, for any invertible sheaf L and any g \u2208 G we have an automorphism lid,g : L|U \u2212\u2192 L|U given\n\u00d7\nby a global section of OU . This gives a map \u03b2 from Pic(P) to the abelian group of homomorphisms of\nabelian sheaves over P from G to O\u00d7\nP . Let q : P \u2192 P be the map to the moduli space, then we have an\nexact sequence:\nq\u2217\n\n\u03b2\n\n0 \u2192 Pic(P ) \u2212\u2192 Pic(P) \u2212\u2192 HomOP (G, O\u00d7\nP) \u2192 0\n\nIndeed, exactness in the middle is proved exactly by the proof of 3.3.3. The pullback q \u2217 is injective\nbecause Pic(P ) = 0. The fact that \u03b2 is surjective is also clear because, given a character f : G \u2192 O\u00d7\nP , we\n\u223c\ncan twist the structure sheaf OP so as to define a sheaf L by L|U = OU for all U , and lid,g : OU \u2212\u2192 OU\nequal to multiplication by f (U )(g). This sheaf satisfies \u03b2(L) = f .\nIt remains to compute Hom(G, O\u00d7\nP ), which is just the character group of G. Using adjunction and\nthe property of the moduli space that q\u2217 OP = OP , we have\n\u00d7\nHomP (G, O\u00d7\nP ) = HomP (G, OP ) = \u03bc2 (A) \u00d7 \u03bcp (A) = Z/2Z \u00d7 (1 + zA)\n\nand this is the result.\n\n\u0003\n\nReferences\n[AbV] D.
