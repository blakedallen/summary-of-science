A key ingredient in this is a\nknowledge of the polarized parton densities. Most of our knowledge of the polarized\nPDFs comes from inclusive deep inelastic scattering (DIS), where, however, one\nobtains information only on the combinations \u2206q(x) + \u2206q\u0304(x). Information on the\npolarized sea quark densities can, in principle, be obtained from semi-inclusive\ndeep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) reactions of the type l + N \u2192 l + h + X, and from\nsemi-inclusive hadron-hadron reactions like p + p \u2192 h + X. However both of the\nlatter require a knowledge of parton fragmentation functions (FFs) describing the\ntransition parton \u2192 h + X.\nThese are not very well known, being obtained principally from analyses of\ne+ + e\u2212 \u2192 h\u00b1 + X, where, however, only the combinations Dqh + Dq\u0304h = Dqh +\nDqh\u0304 \u2261 Dqh+h\u0304 occur. Several sets of FFs are available in the literature \u2013 Kretzer [1],\nKKP [2], AKK [3]), HKNS [4] etc. One study in [5] combined e+ e\u2212 data with\nunpolarized SIDIS data on \u03c0 \u00b1 production, in [6] a combined analysis of e+ e\u2212\nand pp(p\u0304) data was carried on, and quite recently, for the first time, fragmentation\nfunctions were extracted from a global fit to e+ e\u2212 , SIDIS and pp \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 X data [7].\nA comprehensive review on the current status of the fragmentation functions is\npresented in [8].\nTwo points should be noted: 1) in all of these analyses (except [5]) it was\nnecessary to impose some relations, based on theoretical prejudice, between different\n\n1\n\n\fFFs1 , and 2) there is significant disagreement between the various analyses for some\nFFs.\nFor these reasons it is important to try to find ways of extracting FFs without\nany theoretical assumptions about relations between them. In this paper we show\nhow information on certain combinations of FFs can be obtained in a model independent way from both unpolarized SIDIS and semi-inclusive pp reactions. The\nkey experimental ingredients are the differences between cross-sections for producing hadrons and producing their antiparticles i.e data on d\u03c3 h\u2212h\u0304 \u2261 d\u03c3 h \u2212 d\u03c3 h\u0304 . We\nare informed that precise data on such observables is feasible [9].\nOur expressions below correspond to an NLO treatment. LO expressions can be\nobtained by putting \u03b1s = 0, replacing convolutions by ordinary products and using\nonly LO formulae for the partonic cross-sections.\n\n2\n\nThe cross-sections differences\n\nIn this section we consider the cross-sections differences for the two semi-inclusive\nprocesses with charged hadrons h\u00b1 :\ne + N \u2192 e + h\u00b1 + X\n\nand p + p \u2192 h\u00b1 + X\n\n(1)\n\nand define\n+ \u2212h\u2212\n\nh\n\u03c3N\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\nh\nh\n\u2261 \u03c3N\n\u2212 \u03c3N\n,\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\nh \u2212h\nh\nh\nN = p, d and \u03c3pp\n\u2261 \u03c3pp\n\u2212 \u03c3pp\n.\n\n(2)\n\nUsing C-invariance of the strong interactions\nDgh\n\n+ \u2212h\u2212\n\n= 0,\n\nDqh\n\n+ \u2212h\u2212\n\n= \u2212Dqh\n\n+ \u2212h\u2212\n\n(3)\n\nwe obtain rather simple expressions for the cross-section differences and show that in\nany order of QCD they are expressed in terms of only non-singlet (NS) combinations\nof the FFs.\n\n2.1\n\nUnpolarized SIDIS\n\nFor unpolarized e + N \u2192 e + h\u00b1 + X we obtain 2 :\n\n+\n\u2212\n\u03b1s\n1\n[4uV \u2297 Du + dV \u2297 Dd + sV \u2297 Ds ]h \u2212h \u2297 (1 +\nCqq ) (4)\n9\n2\u03c0\n+\n\u2212\n\u03b1s\n1\n+\n\u2212\nCqq ).\nd\u03c3dh \u2212h (x, z, Q2 ) = [(uV + dV ) \u2297 (4Du + Dd ) + 2sV \u2297 Ds ]h \u2212h \u2297 (1 +\n9\n2\u03c0\n(5)\n\nd\u03c3ph\n\n+ \u2212h\u2212\n\n(x, z, Q2 ) =\n\n1\nThough in AKK almost no relations were imposed, we doubt that data is enough to determine\nall FFs independently.\n2\nIn our formula for the SIDIS cross sections, the common kinematic factors have been omitted,\nsee [10] for the complete expressions.\n\n2\n\n\fwhere uV and dV are the usual valence quarks\nuV = u \u2212 \u016b,\n\n \u0304\ndV = d \u2212 d,\n\nand we define sV = s \u2212 s\u0304*\n\n(6)\n\nHere x, z, Q2 are the usual deep inelastic kinematic variables: x = Q2 /2P.q =\nQ2 /2M\u03bd, z = P.P h /P.q = E h /\u03bd, E and E h are the Lab energies of the incoming\nlepton and the final hadron, and the Cqq are Wilson coefficients. Note that: 1)\nh+ \u2212h\u2212\n\u03c3N\ndepends only on NS PDFs and FFs and is independent of the less well\nknown gluon quantities g(x) and Dgh , and 2) the FFs enter multiplied by qV = q \u2212 q\u0304\nwhich implies that the contributions of Duh and Ddh are enhanced by the large valence\nquark densities, while Dsh is suppressed by the small factor (s\u2212s\u0304). Recently a strong\nbound on (s \u2212 s\u0304) was obtained from neutrino experiments, |s \u2212 s\u0304| \u2264 0.025 [11]. This\nimplies that the large uncertainties in Dsh should not affect strongly the results for\n+\n\u2212\nh+ \u2212h\u2212\n\u03c3N\n, and we expect the contribution of (s \u2212 s\u0304)Dsh \u2212h to be within the experimental error and to be neglegible. Then Eqs. (4) and (5) provide two independent\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\nmeasurements for the two unknown FFs Duh \u2212h and Ddh \u2212h . These equations\nhold for the sum over charged hadrons and for each identified hadron separately.\nFurther information can be obtained when the final hadrons are identified.\n1) If h = \u03c0 \u00b1 then Eqs. (4) and (5) present two independent measurements that\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\ndetermine Du\u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 and Dd\u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 in a model independent way. Comparison to the ex\u00b1\n\u00b1\nisting parametrizations for Du\u03c0 and Dd\u03c0 would be a check of these parametrizations.\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\nAlso, comparing Du\u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 and Dd\u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 would check the usually made assumption\nDu\u03c0\n\n+ \u2212\u03c0 \u2212\n\n= \u2212Dd\u03c0\n\n+ \u2212\u03c0 \u2212\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\nRecently in [7] it was shown, for the first time, that this relation might be violated\nup to 10 %.\nIf eq.

Comparing DuK \u2212K to the existing parametrizations would\ncheck the parametrizations for kaon FFs. In all parametrizations it is always assumed that\nDdK\n\n+ \u2212K \u2212\n\n= 0.\n\n(10)\n\nThe above measurement would be a direct test of this assumption.\n3\n\n\fIf (10) holds, Eqs.

The d\u03c3\u0302ab\nare calculated in perturbative\nQCD. In LO these are 2 \u2192 2 QCD scattering processes, i.e. X stands just for one\nparton, s + t + u = 0 and one of the integrations can be done immediately. In total\nthere are 8 different LO cross sections, expressions for which can be found in many\nplaces, for example [14]. In NLO, apart from the virtual one-loop corrections to the\n2 \u2192 2 processes, also real 2 \u2192 3 new processes of order O(\u03b1s3 ) are included. This\nleads to twenty different inclusive processes [15], [16]. In this case s, t and u are\nindependent variables. Eq. (15) implies that due to C-invariance only four inclusive\nh+ \u2212h\u2212\npartonic cross sections contribute to d\u03c3pp\nin LO and six in NLO. These are:\n\nLO : qq \u2032 \u2192 q(q \u2032 ), qq \u2192 q(q), q q\u0304 \u2192 q(q\u0304), qg \u2192 q(g)\nNLO : qq \u2032 \u2192 qX, qq \u2192 qX, q q\u0304 \u2192 qX, q\u0304X qg \u2192 qX, q\u0304X\n\n(21)\n\nwhere the final q or q\u0304 are the fragmenting quarks.\nThe cross section (15) involves only NS FFs and, thus, the most troublesome\nDgh does not contribute. Also, we would like to emphasize that the structure of the\n+\n\u2212\ncross section is just the same as in SIDIS - Dqh \u2212h enters always multiplied by\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n(q \u2212 q\u0304) = qV , i.e. in the combination qV Dqh \u2212h . This implies again that Duh \u2212h\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\nand Ddh \u2212h are enhanced by the large valence-quark densities, while Dsh \u2212h is\n3\n\nStrictly speaking,\nin NLO eq.(15) is an exact expression only if the masses of quarks are\n\u221a\nnegligible, mq / s \u226a 1. For heavy flavour production a charge asymmetry of order \u03b13s is generated [12, 13] and more partonic processes will contribute. However, these effects seem too small\nto affect our considerations.\n\n5\n\n\fsuppressed by the small quantity (s \u2212 s\u0304) and its contribution should be negligible.\nHowever, that should be checked by calculating Lq (s, t, u), which depends only on\nknown quantities.\nThus, ep, ed and pp semi-inclusive cross-section differences determine the same\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\ncombinations of FFs: Duh \u2212h , Ddh \u2212h and Dsh \u2212h . Using the experimentally\n+\n\u2212\nwell justified approximation s = s\u0304, Dsh \u2212h will not contribute and the three semiinclusive difference cross sections of ep, ed and pp scattering determine indepen+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\ndently the two quantities Duh \u2212h and Ddh \u2212h . If s \u2212 s\u0304 = 0, eq. (15) reads:\nh+ \u2212h\u2212\nh d\u03c3pp\nE\nd3 P h\n\n1\ndz\ndxa dxb\n=\n\u00d7\n\u03c0n\nz\n+\n\u2212\n\u00d7 [Lu (xb , t, u)uV (xa ) + (xa \u2194 xb , u \u2194 t)] Duh \u2212h (z)+\nZ\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n+ [Ld (xb , t, u)dV (xa ) + (xa \u2194 xb , u \u2194 t)] Ddh\n\n+\n\n+ \u2212h\u2212\n\no\n\n(z) .\n\n(22)\n\n\u2212\n\nAs Dqh \u2212h are non-singlets the gluon FF that introduces, in general, lot of uncertainties will not appear in the Q2 -evolution.\nNote that taking s \u2212 s\u0304 = 0 is not an assumption \u2013 it is an approximation linked\nto the precision of the experiment. If the accuracy for the cross-section differences\njustifies doing so, the strange quark contribution can be included and the cross+\n\u2212\nsection differences will provide information about (s \u2212 s\u0304) Dsh \u2212h as well. It has\nbeen suggested that a relatively big s \u2212 s\u0304 difference could be generated in NNLO\nperturbative QCD [17].\n+\n\u2212\n\u03c0 + \u2212\u03c0 \u2212\nIf h = \u03c0 \u00b1 , eq.(7) implies that \u03c3pp\nis expressed solely in terms of Du\u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 :\n\u03c0 + \u2212\u03c0 \u2212\nh d \u03c3pp\nE\nd3 P \u03c0\n\ndz\n1\ndxa dxb\n=\n[Lu (xb , t, u)uV (xa ) \u2212 Ld (xb , t, u)dV (xa ) +\n\u03c0\nz\n+\n\u2212\n+ Lu (xa , u, t)uV (xb ) \u2212 Ld (xa , u, t)dV (xb )] Du\u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 .\nZ\n\n\u03c0 + \u2212\u03c0 \u2212\n\n(23)\n\n\u03c0 + \u2212\u03c0 \u2212\n\nThus, not only the SIDIS cross sections \u03c3p\nand \u03c3d\n, but also the single in\u03c0 + \u2212\u03c0 \u2212\nclusive proton-proton collisions \u03c3pp\nare expressed in terms of the single quantity\n+ \u2212\u03c0 \u2212\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n\u03c0\nDu\u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 if Du\u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 = \u2212Dd\nholds.\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n\u00b1\nIf h = K the difference cross sections will determine only DuK \u2212K and DdK \u2212K ,\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\nK + \u2212K \u2212\nwhich would test the assumption DdK \u2212K = 0.

If\nand for pp \u2192 h + X are expressed in terms of the same non-singlet FFs Du,d,s\nin addition to charged kaons K \u00b1 , also the neutral Ks0 can be measured, then SU(2)\n+\n\u2212\n0\ninvariance implies that for all three types of process the combination \u03c3 K +K \u2212Ks is\n+\n\u2212\nexpressed solely in terms of one non-singlet combination (Du \u2212 Dd )K +K . These\nmeasurements do not provide full information about the FFs, but only part of it,\nwhich however is model independent and correct in any order in QCD. This allows to\ntest both the existing parametrizations and some of the usually made assumptions.\nThey also provide a test of Q2 -evolution and factorization.\n\nAcknowledgements\nOne of us (E.Ch.) is thankful to Marco Stratmann for the useful discussions.\n\nReferences\n[1] S.
