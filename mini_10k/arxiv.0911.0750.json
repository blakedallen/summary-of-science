Let {ti }i=0,1,2,... denote a time sequence where\nt0 is the present and ti+1 > ti for all i \u2208 N0 . We assume that {ti } is unbounded in the sense\n1\n\n\fthat for any T there exists a value of i such that ti > T . The economy is represented by a\nprobability space (\u03a9, F , P) with a filtration {Fi }i\u22650 which we call the \"market filtration\".\nEach asset is characterised by a pair {Sti }i\u22650 and {Dti }i\u22650 which we call the \"value process\"\nand the \"dividend process\". We interpret Dti as the random cash flow paid out by the asset\nat time ti . Then Sti denotes the \"ex-dividend\" value of the asset at ti . For simplicity, we\noften write Si = Sti and Di = Dti . To ensure the absence of arbitrage, we assume the\nexistence of a positive pricing kernel {\u03c0i }i\u22650 , and make the following assumptions:\nAxiom A. For any asset with value process {Si }i\u2265\u221e and dividend process {Di }i\u22650 , the\nprocess {Mi }i\u22650 defined by\ni\nX\nMi = \u03c0i Si +\n\u03c0n Dn\n(1.1)\nn=0\n\nis a martingale.\nAxiom B. There exists a positive non-dividend-paying asset with value process {B\u0304i }i\u22650\nsuch that B\u0304i+1 > B\u0304i for all i \u2208 N0 , and that for any b \u2208 R there exists a time ti such that\nB\u0304i > b.\nThe notation {B\u0304i } distinguishes the positive return asset from the previsible moneymarket account {Bi } introduced later. Since {B\u0304i } is non-dividend paying, Axiom A implies\nthat {\u03c0i B\u0304i } is a martingale. Writing \u03c1\u0304i = \u03c0i B\u0304i , we have \u03c0i = \u03c1\u0304i /B\u0304i . Since {B\u0304i } is increasing,\n{\u03c0i } is a supermartingale, and it follows from Axiom B that\nlim E[\u03c0i ] = 0.\n\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nWe obtain the following result concerning limited-liability assets.\nProposition 1. Let Si \u2265 0 and Di \u2265 0 for all i \u2208 N. We have\n\" \u221e\n#\nX\n1\nmi\n+ Ei\n\u03c0n Dn ,\nSi =\n\u03c0i\n\u03c0i\nn=i+1\n\n(1.2)\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhere {mi } is a non-negative martingale that vanishes if and only if:\nlim E[\u03c0j Sj ] = 0.\n\nj\u2192\u221e\n\n(1.4)\n\nThus {mi } represents that part of the value of the asset that is \"never paid out\". An\nidealised money-market account is of this nature, and so is a \"permanent bubble\" (cf. Tirole\n1982, Armerin 2004). In the case of an asset for which the \"transversality\" condition (1.4)\nis satisfied, the price is directly related to the future dividend flow:\n\" \u221e\n#\nX\n1\n\u03c0n Dn .\n(1.5)\nSi = Ei\n\u03c0i\nn=i+1\n2\n\n\fThis is the so-called \"fundamental equation\" often used as a basis for asset pricing (cf.\nCochrane 2005). Alternatively we can write\nSi =\n\n1\n(Ei [F\u221e ] \u2212 Fi ),\n\u03c0i\n\n(1.6)\n\nP\nwhere Fi = in=0 \u03c0n Dn ,and F\u221e = limi\u2192\u221e Fi . Hence the price of a pure dividend-paying\nasset can be expressed as a ratio of potentials, giving us a discrete-time analogue of a result\nof Rogers 1997.\n\n2\n\nPositive-return asset and pricing kernel\n\nLet us introduce the notation\n\nB\u0304i \u2212 B\u0304i\u22121\n(2.1)\nB\u0304i\u22121\nfor the rate of return of the positive-return asset realised at time ti on an investment made\nat ti\u22121 . The notation r\u0304i is used to distinguish the rate of return on {B\u0304i } from the rate of\nreturn ri on the money market account {Bi } introduced later.\nProposition 2. There exists an asset with constant value Si = 1 for all i \u2208 N0 , for\nwhich the associated cash flows are given by {r\u0304i }i\u22651 .\nProposition 3. Let {B\u0304i } be a positive-return asset satisfying Axioms A and B, and\nlet {r\u0304i } be its rate-of-return process. Then the pricing kernel can be expressed in the form\nP\n\u03c0i = Ei [G\u221e ] \u2212 Gi , where Gi = in=1 \u03c0n r\u0304n and G\u221e = limi\u2192\u221e Gi .\nThere is a converse to this result that allows one to construct a system satisfying Axioms\nA and B from a strictly-increasing non-negative adapted process that converges and satisfies\nan integrability condition:\nProposition 4. Let {Gi }i\u22650 be a strictly-increasing adapted process with G0 = 0, and\nE[G\u221e ] < \u221e, where G\u221e = limi\u2192\u221e Gi . Let {\u03c0i }, {r\u0304i }, and {B\u0304i } be defined by \u03c0i = Ei [G\u221e ]\u2212Gi\nQ\nfor i \u2265 0, r\u0304i = (Gi \u2212 Gi\u22121 )/\u03c0i for i \u2265 1, and B\u0304i = in=1 (1 + r\u0304n ) for i \u2265 1, with B\u03040 = 1.\nLet {\u03c1\u0304i } be defined by \u03c1\u0304i = \u03c0i B\u0304i for i \u2265 0. Then {\u03c1\u0304i } is a martingale, and limj\u2192\u221e B\u0304j = \u221e,\nfrom which it follows that {\u03c0i } and {B\u0304i } satisfy Axioms A and B.\nr\u0304i =\n\n3\n\nDiscrete-time discount bond systems\n\nThe price Pij at ti of a discount bond that matures at tj (i < j) is\nPij =\n\n1\nEi [\u03c0j ].\n\u03c0i\n\n(3.1)\n\nSince \u03c0i > 0 for i \u2208 N, and Ei [\u03c0j ] < \u03c0i for i < j, it follows that 0 < Pij < 1 for i < j.\nWe observe that the \"per-period\" interest rate Rij defined by Pij = 1/(1 + Rij ) is positive.\n3\n\n\fSince {\u03c0i } is given, there is no need to model the volatility structure of the bonds. Thus, our\nscheme differs from the discrete-time models discussed in Heath et al. 1990, and Filipovi\u0107\n& Zabczyk 2002. As an example of a class of discrete-time models set \u03c0i = \u03b1i + \u03b2i Ni , where\n{\u03b1i } and {\u03b2i } are positive, strictly-decreasing deterministic processes with limi\u2192\u221e \u03b1i = 0\nand limi\u2192\u221e \u03b2i = 0, and where {Ni } is a positive martingale. Then we have\nPij =\n\n\u03b1j + \u03b2j Ni\n,\n\u03b1i + \u03b2i Ni\n\n(3.2)\n\ngiving a family of \"rational\" interest rate models. In a discrete-time setting we can produce\nmodels that do not necessarily have analogues in continuous time-for example, we can let\n{Ni } be the martingale associated with a branching process.\nAny discount bond system consistent with our scheme admits a representation of the\nFlesaker-Hughston type (Rutkowski 1997, Jin & Glasserman 2001, Cairns 2004, Musiela &\nRutkowski 2005, Bj\u00f6rk 2009). More precisely, we have the following:\nProposition 5. Let {\u03c0i }, {B\u0304i }, {Pij } satisfy Axioms A and B. Then there exists a\nfamily of positive martingales {min }0\u2264i\u2264n , n \u2208 N, such that\nP\u221e\nn=j+1 min\n.\n(3.3)\nPij = P\u221e\nn=i+1 min\n\n4\n\nConstruction of the money-market asset\n\nLet us look now at the situation where the positive-return asset is previsible. Thus we\nassume that Bi is Fi\u22121 -measurable and we drop the \"bar\" over Bi . In that case we have\n\u0014 \u0015\n1\nBi\u22121\nBi\u22121\n\u03c1i\nPi\u22121,i =\n=\nEi\u22121 [\u03c0i ] =\nEi\u22121\n.\n(4.1)\n\u03c0i\u22121\n\u03c1i\u22121\nBi\nBi\nHence, writing Pi\u22121,i = 1/(1 + ri ) where ri = Ri\u22121,i we see that the rate of return on the\nmoney-market account is previsible, and is given by the one-period discount factor associated\nwith the bond that matures at ti .\nReverting to the general situation, it follows that if we are given a pricing kernel {\u03c0i } on\n(\u03a9, F , P, {Fi}), and a system of assets satisfying Axioms A and B, then we can construct a\ncandidate for a previsible money market account by setting B0 = 1 and\nBi = (1 + ri )(1 + ri\u22121 ) * * * (1 + r1 ),\nfor i \u2265 1, where ri is defined by\nri =\n\n\u03c0i\u22121\n\u2212 1.\nEi\u22121 [\u03c0i ]\n4\n\n(4.2)\n\n(4.3)\n\n\fWe refer to {Bi } as the \"natural\" money-market account associated with {\u03c0i }. To justify\nthis terminology, we verify that {Bi }, so constructed, satisfies Axioms A and B. To this end,\nwe note the following multiplicative decomposition. Let {\u03c0i } be a positive supermartingale\nsatisfying Ei [\u03c0j ] < \u03c0i for i < j and limj\u2192\u221e [\u03c0j ] = 0. Then we can write \u03c0i = \u03c1i /Bi , where\n\u03c01\n\u03c0i\u22121\n\u03c0i\n***\n\u03c00\n(4.4)\n\u03c1i =\nEi\u22121 [\u03c0i ] Ei\u22122 [\u03c0i\u22121]\nE0 [\u03c01 ]\nfor i \u2265 0, and\n\n\u03c0i\u22122\n\u03c01\n\u03c00\n\u03c0i\u22121\n***\n(4.5)\nEi\u22121 [\u03c0i ] Ei\u22122 [\u03c0i\u22121 ]\nE1 [\u03c02 ] E0 [\u03c01 ]\nfor i \u2265 1, with B0 = 1. In this scheme we have\n\u03c0i\n\u03c1i =\n\u03c1i\u22121 ,\n(4.6)\nEi\u22121 [\u03c0i ]\nwith \u03c10 = \u03c00 ; and\n\u03c0i\u22121\nBi =\nBi\u22121 ,\n(4.7)\nEi\u22121 [\u03c0i ]\nwith B0 = 1. It is evident that {\u03c1i } is {Fi }-adapted, and that {Bi } is previsible and\nincreasing. We establish the following:\nProposition 6. Let {\u03c0i } be a non-negative supermartingale such that Ei [\u03c0j ] < \u03c0i for all\nQ\ni < j \u2208 N0 , and limi\u2192\u221e E[\u03c0i ] = 0. Let {Bi } be defined by B0 = 1 and Bi = in=1 (1 + rn ) for\ni \u2265 1, where 1 + ri = \u03c0i\u22121 /Ei\u22121 [\u03c0i ], and set \u03c1i = \u03c0i Bi for i \u2265 0. Then {\u03c1i } is a martingale,\nand the interest rate system defined by {\u03c0i }, {Bi }, {Pij } satisfies Axioms A and B.\nA significant feature of Proposition 6 is that no integrability condition is required on\n{\u03c1i }: the natural money market account defined above \"automatically\" satisfies Axiom A.\nThus in place of Axiom B we can assume:\nAxiom B\u2217 . There exists a positive non-dividend paying asset, the money-market account\n{Bi }i\u22650 , having the properties that Bi+1 > Bi for i \u2208 N0 , that Bi is Fi\u22121 -measurable for\ni \u2208 N, and that for any b \u2208 R there exists a ti such that Bi > b.\nThe content of Proposition 6 is that Axioms A and B together are equivalent to Axioms\nA and B\u2217 together. Let us establish that the class of interest rate models satisfying Axioms\nA and B\u2217 is non-vacuous. In particular, consider the \"rational\" model defined for some\nchoice of {Ni }. It is an exercise to see that the previsible money market account is given for\ni = 0 by B0 = 1 and for i \u2265 1 by\nBi =\n\nBi =\n\ni\nY\n\u03b1n\u22121 + \u03b2n\u22121 Nn\u22121\n\nn=1\n\nand that for {\u03c1i } we have\n\n\u03c1i = \u03c10\n\n\u03b1n + \u03b2n Nn\u22121\n\ni\nY\n\u03b1n + \u03b2n Nn\n,\n\u03b1\n+\n\u03b2\nN\nn\nn\nn\u22121\nn=1\n\n,\n\n(4.8)\n\n(4.9)\n\nwhere \u03c10 = \u03b10 + \u03b20 N0 . One can check for each i \u2265 0 that \u03c1i is bounded; therefore {\u03c1i } is a\nmartingale, and {Bi } satisfies Axioms A and B\u2217 .\n5\n\n\f5\n\nDoob decomposition\n\nConsider now the Doob decomposition given by \u03c0i = Ei [A\u221e ] \u2212 Ai , with\nAi =\n\ni\u22121\nX\n\n(\u03c0n \u2212 En [\u03c0n+1 ])\n\n(5.1)\n\nn=0\n\nas discussed, e.g., in Meyer 1966. It follows that\ni\u22121\nX\n\n\u0012\n\u0013 X\ni\u22121\ni\u22121\nX\nEn [\u03c0n+1 ]\nAi =\n\u03c0n 1 \u2212\n=\n\u03c0n (1 \u2212 Pn,n+1) =\n\u03c0n rn+1 Pn,n+1,\n\u03c0n\nn=0\nn=0\nn=0\n\n(5.2)\n\nwhere {ri } is the previsible short rate process. The pricing kernel can therefore be put in\nthe form\n\"\u221e\n#\nX\n\u03c0i = Ei\n\u03c0n rn+1 Pn,n+1 .\n(5.3)\nn=i\n\nComparing (5.3) with the decomposition \u03c0i = Ei [G\u221e ] \u2212 Gi , Gi =\nProposition 3, we see that by setting\nr\u0304i =\n\nri \u03c0i\u22121 Pi\u22121,i\n\u03c0i\n\nPi\n\nn=1\n\n\u03c0n r\u0304n , given in\n\n(5.4)\n\nwe obtain a positive-return asset based on the Doob decomposition.\n\n6\n\nForeign exchange processes\n\nAn extension of the material presented here to models for foreign exchange and inflation is\npursued in Hughston & Macrina (2008). In particular, since the money-market account is a\npositive-return asset, by Proposition 3 we can write:\n\" \u221e\n#\nX\n\u03c0i = Ei\n\u03c0n rn .\n(6.1)\nn=i+1\n\nAs a consequence, we see that the price process of a pure dividend-paying asset can be\nwritten in the following symmetrical form:\n\u0003\n\u0002P\u221e\nEi\nn=i+1 \u03c0n Dn\n\u0002P\u221e\n\u0003.\nSi =\n(6.2)\nEi\nn=i+1 \u03c0n rn\n\nIn the case where {Si } represents a foreign currency, the dividend process is the foreign\ninterest rate, and both {Di } and {ri } are previsible.\n\n6\n\n\fReferences\n[1] F.
