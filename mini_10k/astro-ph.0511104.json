During this intense\ndeployment phase, the SD instantaneous aperture keeps increasing at an irregular pace, depending on the water\ntank deployment rate and the evolving geometry of the array. While the local trigger rate (i.e. at the level of\nindividual stations) is simply proportional to the number of stations in the SD array, the number of exploitable\nevents increases at a rate depending on the central trigger conditions and on specific cuts applied to guarantee a\nhigh-quality data set. The chain of triggers is described in [1]. Most relevant to the SD acceptance calculations\nare the so-called high-level triggers, namely the physics trigger T4 selecting real cosmic-ray (CR) events in a\ndata set partially contaminated by chance coincidences between neighbour tanks, and the quality trigger T5\nselecting events offering nominal reconstruction accuracy.\nThe standard SD data set is composed of events from CR-induced showers developing along a zenith angle\n\u03b8 \u2264 60\u25e6 . These events are selected very efficiently by the T4 condition requiring that at least 3 tanks pass\nthe time-over-threshold (ToT) trigger (see [1]). The T5 trigger applied to the data set used in this Conference\nconsists of two conditions: 1) the SD station recording the highest signal from the shower must be surrounded\nby at least 5 active tanks among the 6 closest neighbours, and 2) the reconstructed shower core must be inside\nan equilateral triangle of active stations at the time of the event. This guarantees that no crucial information is\nmissed for the shower reconstruction: it essentially rejects events located close to the array boundary or close\nto a temporarily missing tank inside the array.\n\n2.\n\nDetection efficiency in an elementary hexagon\n\n2.1 Lateral Trigger Probability function (LTP)\nAt high energy, CR-induced showers have a big enough print on the ground to trigger many SD stations\nindependently of where they exactly fall in the array. At lower energy, however, the granularity of the array\nbecomes important and the ability of a given shower to trigger (at least) three tanks depends on the position\nof the shower core (i.e. the intersection of the shower axis with the ground) with respect to the closest tanks.\nThe particle density in the shower is a steeply decreasing function of the distance to the shower axis, rsf (radial\ncoordinate away from the axis), and so is the probability for a given shower to trigger a tank.\n\n\f2\n\nAllard et al., for the Pierre Auger Collaboration\n1,2\n\n1,2\n\nlog E (eV) = 17.8\n\nprotons\n! = 25\u00b0\n\n0,8\n\n0,6\n\n0,4\n\n17.8\n\n18 18.2\n\n18.4\n\n18.6\n\n0,2\n\n0\n500\n\nprotons\n\n1\n\nTOT trigger probability\n\nTOT trigger probability\n\n1\n\n0,8\n\n25\u00b0\n36\u00b0\n\n0,6\n\n45\u00b0\n53\u00b0\n0,4\n\n60\u00b0\n0,2\n\n0\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\ndistance to shower axis (in meters)\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\ndistance to shower axis (in meters)\n\nFigure 1. Examples of LTP functions for proton-induced showers at a zenith angle \u03b8 = 25\u25e6 for different energies labeled\nby log10 (E), where E is in eV (left) and at energy E = 1017.8 eV for different zenith angles (right).\n\nAs recalled above, for the nominal PAO SD data set we use a \"3ToT condition\" and we are thus interested in the probability that a given CR-induced shower triggers at least 3 stations with the ToT condition. It is convenient to introduce the so-called Lateral Trigger Probability function (LTP), giving the local (individual tank) ToT trigger probability as function of rsf , for any shower induced by CRs of type\ni (protons, nuclei, photons...), energy E and arrival direction with zenith angle \u03b8 and azimuth \u03c6. At the\nenergies of interest, the influence of the geomagnetic field and thus the dependence on \u03c6 are negligible.\nFrom the practical point of view, the LTP functions can be obtained from a set of Monte-Carlo simulations of the primary CR interaction, shower development and tank response, as the fraction of tanks that\npass the trigger in different bins of distance, rsf , from a large number of showers with given parameters:\nPi,E,\u03b8 (rsf ) = (No. of stations passing the trigger at rsf )/(total No. of stations at distance rsf ).\nExamples of LTP functions are shown in Fig. 1 for proton showers simulated with the Corsika Monte-Carlo\nprogram[2] using the QGSJet hadronic model[3], for different primary energies and zenith angles. Obviously,\nthe trigger probability is 1 close to the shower core and 0 far away from it. The transition radius, r1/2 , such that\nPi,E,\u03b8 (r1/2 ) = 1/2 is an increasing function of energy (as the shower gets bigger) and a decreasing function\nof \u03b8 (as the shower gets older). The transition region also grows from \u223c 200 m at 25\u25e6 to \u223c 600 m at 60\u25e6 .\nIt is worth emphasizing that the LTP functions gather all the information relevant to aperture and exposure calculations, summarizing the properties of the shower development, tank response and trigger definition. To each\nchoice of simulation codes and local trigger definition corresponds a set of LTPs from which the PAO detection\nefficiency can be computed straightforwardly. When we have larger statistics, the LTPs will be derived directly\nfrom the data using hybrid events to measure the SD trigger probability, so that it will be possible to correct for\nthe partial efficiency at low energy in a model-independent way. The systematic comparison of measured and\npredicted LTPs will also provide valuable information about the physical ingredients of the models.\n2.2 Effective detection surface and elementary aperture\nFor any shower core position and arrival direction, one can compute the distance of each tank in the shower\nframe and deduce its trigger probability from the above LTP functions. The probability to pass the global\nT4 trigger then follows from a simple combination of these local LTP values. Let us consider an elementary\n\n\f3\n\nDetermination of the Aperture of the Pierre Auger Observatory surface detector\n1,2\n\n1,2\n\n0\u00b0 ! ! ! 60\u00b0\n1\n\n53\u00b0\n25\u00b0\n45\u00b0\n\n0,8\n\nrelative aperture\n\neffective detection surface\n\n1\n\n36\u00b0\n0\u00b0\n0,6\n\n60\u00b0\n\n0,4\n\nFe\n\n0,8\n\np\n\n3ToT\n\np\n\n4ToT\n\n0,4\n\n0,2\n\n0,2\n\nprotons\nT4 = 3ToT\n1018\n\nFe\n\n0,6\n\n1019\n\n1018\n\n1019\nE (eV)\n\nE (EeV)\n\nFigure 2.

For a\ngiven shower with core position (xc , yc ), let Pi and Qi \u2261 1 \u2212 Pi be the probability that station i triggers and\nQi=7\ndoes not trigger, respectively. The probability that none of the 7 tanks gets triggered\nP is simply P(0) = i=1 Qi .\nLikewise, the probability that one and only one tank gets triggered is P(1) = i P(0) \u00d7 (Pi /Qi ). Finally, the\nprobability that the shower passes the high-level T4 trigger and be part of the PAO data set, i.e. the probability\nthat at least 3 tanks pass the ToT trigger is given by: \uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nX Pi X Pi Pj\n\uf8fb.\nPT4 (xc , yc ) = 1 \u2212 P(0) \uf8f01 +\n+\n(1)\nQ\nQ\nQ\ni\ni\nj\ni\nj>i\nThis allows us to calculate the trigger probability for showers of any energy, mass, and angle as a function of the\ncore position. The global shower detection efficiency is then obtained by averaging over all the allowed shower\ncore positions, i.e. satisfying the T5 condition. They are shown as shaded area in Fig. 3. On the left, where\nall 7 tanks are present, the allowed core positions are such that the closest tank (which is bound to record the\nlargest signal) is the central one, since all the others do not satisfy the requirement of having 5 neighbours. On\nthe right, the rightmost tank is missing and shower core positions in the two concerned triangles are excluded.\nIn practice, we compute the effective detection surface of the elementary hexagonal cell as the integral of its\narea (in the allowed region) weighted by the trigger probability:\nZ\nPT4 (xc , yc ) \u00d7 HT5 (xc , yc ) \u00d7 dS,\n(2)\nSeff =\ncell\n\nwhere HT5 (x, y) implements the T5 condition and is equal to either 1 or 0, depending on whether the core\nposition is allowed or not. Results are shown in Fig. 2a for the same proton showers as above, as a function of\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\nenergy: Seff saturates at \u223c 3 EeV for moderately inclined showers, and \u223c\nR 4 EeV for showers at \u03b8 = 0 or 60 .\nFinally, the aperture is obtained by integrating over solid angle: a(E) = \u03b8\u226460\u25e6 Seff (E, \u03b8, \u03c6) cos \u03b8\u00d7sin \u03b8d\u03c6d\u03b8.\nResults are shown in Fig. 2b for two different choices of the T4 condition: at least 3 or at least 4 stations with a\nToT trigger. The latter thus requires one more tank and is then less efficient at low energy. Figure 2b also shows\nthat the SD array is more sensitive to Fe nuclei than to protons at low energy, which can be used to constrain the\nprimary composition of CRs in the astrophysically important region of the ankle. The SD detection efficiency\nis 1 above 3 EeV and 7 EeV for the 3ToT and 4ToT triggers, respectively.\n\n\f4\n\nAllard et al., for the Pierre Auger Collaboration\n\n3.\n\nInstantaneous aperture of the SD array and integrated exposure\n\nThe T5 trigger allows us to exploit the regularity of the hexagonal array in a very simple way. The instantaneous\naperture of any array configuration is obtained as a multiple of the above-mentioned elementary aperture: we\nsimply need to consider each tank, one after the other, and determine its contribution to the global aperture.\nAny tank with six active neighbours (Fig. 3a) contributes exactly the elementary hexagon aperture,\nwhile any tank with five neighbours contributes 4/6th\nof that, as illustrated in Fig. 3b. Tanks with less than\n5 neighbours do not contribute at all. The aperture of\na hexagonal cell is thus the building block of all aperture calculations, to be computed once and for all or\nmeasured thanks to hybrid data. At full efficiency,\ni.e. above \u223c 3 EeV, the detection\n\u221a area per internal\ntank (with 6 neighbours) is D2 \u00d7 3/2 \u2243 1.95 km2 ,\nwhere D = 1.5 km is the array spacing, and the corresponding aperture for showers with \u03b8 < 60\u25e6 is then\nacell \u2243 4.59 km2 sr.\n\nFigure 3. Schematic view of the area (shaded region)\nwhere the shower core must be located inside an elementary hexagonal cell in order to pass the T5 trigger (left: full\nhexagon; right: hexagon with a missing vertex).\n\nTo calculate the integrated exposure of the SD over a given period of time, one finally has to count the number\nof cell-seconds corresponding to that period. The array configuration changes occasionally when new tanks are\ndeployed or when stations experience failures (e.g. electronics, power supply, communications...) and thus get\ntemporarily \"out\" of the array (or back in). These changes in the array configuration are monitored through the\nlocal trigger rate with a time resolution of one second (much better than needed for exposure calculations!). For\neach new configuration, the number of elementary cells, Ncell , is computed and the exposure is incremented\nby Ncell \u00d7 acell \u00d7 \u2206t, where \u2206t is the duration of the configuration. For the period from Jan. 1st, 2004 to\nJune 5th, 2005, we obtained 1.21 \u00d7 1010 cell-seconds, which corresponds to 1750 km2 sr yr. At low energy,\nthis number must be scaled according to the relative aperture given in Fig. 2b.\nThe accuracy of this exposure calculation is expected to be excellent at energies above saturation, since it is\nbased on purely geometrical considerations. However, the monitoring of the instantaneous array configurations\nmay not be complete, and we have considered the possibility of hidden dead times that would not appear at the\ntank level or in the communication chain from the stations to the CDAS. This will be monitored appropriately\nin the near future. By comparing the daily averaged number of events in our data set with the mean number\nexpected from the exposure calculations (with Poissonian fluctuations), we estimated a possible error of \u223c 5%.\nThat would thus lead to an error of \u223c 5% on the differential CR flux, equivalent to an energy shift of less than\n2%, which is negligible compared to the PAO energy accuracy. The uncertainty on the integrated exposure can\nthus be considered as negligible.\n\nReferences\n[1] Allard et al, for the Pierre Auger Collaboration, this conference (usa-bauleo-PM-abs1-he14-poster).\n[2] D.
