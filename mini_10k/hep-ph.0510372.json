The Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation controls a bound-state amplitude\nencoding, in momentum space, the distribution of the relative momenta of the bound-state\nconstituents. Within elementary particle physics this formalism has been widely applied to\nquantum electrodynamics (QED) and quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Unfortunately it\nfaces problems of interpretation and of our ignorance of the full interaction kernel in QCD.\nThus, simplifications of the Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation in form of some three-dimensional\nreductions are highly desirable. The most famous among all proposals is known as Salpeter\nequation [2]. Its formulation, however, is based on assuming all bound-state constituents to\ninteract instantaneously and to propagate as free particles; the latter circumstance renders\nhard to implement effects such as spontaneous chiral-symmetry breaking, crucial for QCD.\nIn view of this, an instantaneous Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation which incorporates the exact\nform of the propagators of the bound-state constituents (to the utmost conceivable extent)\nhas been derived recently [3]; this improved bound-state equation reduces, of course, to the\nSalpeter equation, upon approximation of the exact propagators by their free counterparts.\nFor any description of hadrons as bound states, the exact quark propagators conforming to\nthe QCD Dyson\u2013Schwinger equations are relevant. This work is devoted to the study of the\nconsequences of introducing exact quark propagators in this instantaneous Bethe\u2013Salpeter\nequation. The most dramatic effect observed is a significant diminution of the level spacing.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sketches the derivation of our instantaneous\nBethe\u2013Salpeter equation with exact propagators of the bound-state constituents presented\nin Ref. [3]. Approximating all interactions entering in the Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation by their\nstatic forms but retaining, as far as possible, exact propagators yields [3] a generalization of\nSalpeter's equation [2], with momentum-dependent masses of the bound-state constituents\nand with normalization factors of their exact propagators multiplying all interaction terms.\nSection 3 introduces the exact light-quark propagators obtained within QCD as solution of\nthe Dyson\u2013Schwinger equations. This infinite tower of coupled integral equations calls for a\ntruncation [4\u201324] which must not be in conflict with the relevant Ward\u2013Takahashi identity.\nSection 4 summarizes the technique developed for finding the solutions of an instantaneous\nBethe\u2013Salpeter equation by first reducing it to a coupled set of radial equations [25\u201328] and\nthen converting it to a matrix eigenvalue problem [29\u201332]. Some implications of taking into\naccount exact instead of free propagators of bound-state constituents are analyzed in Sec. 5\nby application of the entire formalism to a linear confining interaction. Section 6 scrutinizes\nour findings. Appendix A recalls the Hilbert-space basis required for the matrix conversion.\n\n2\n\nInstantaneous Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation with exact\npropagators\n\nThe derivation of the exact-propagator instantaneous Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation [3] parallels\nthe (three-dimensional) reduction of the Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation [1] to the free-propagator\nSalpeter equation [2]. It may be achieved by several slightly different but equivalent routes.\nIn the framework of the Bethe\u2013Salpeter formalism, a bound state |B(P )i of momentum\n\n\f2\nP and mass MB , composed of a fermion and an antifermion described by the field operators\n\u03c81 (x1 ), \u03c8\u03042 (x2 ), resp., is represented, in momentum space, by the Bethe\u2013Salpeter amplitude\n\u03a8(p) \u2261 exp(i P X)\n\nZ\n\nd4 x exp(i p x) h0|T(\u03c81 (x1 ) \u03c8\u03042 (x2 ))|B(P )i .\n\nHere, X and x denote the center-of-momentum and relative coordinates of the two-particle\nsystem while P and p label the total and relative momenta of the bound-state constituents.\nThis Bethe\u2013Salpeter amplitude \u03a8 has to satisfy the homogeneous Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation\nZ\ni\n\u03a8(p) =\nS1 (p1 ) d4 q K(p, q) \u03a8(q) S2(\u2212p2 ) .\n(1)\n4\n(2\u03c0)\nThe dynamical ingredients of this equation of motion are the exact propagators Si (p) of the\ntwo bound fermions i = 1, 2 (with individual momenta p1 , p2 ) and the interaction kernel K,\na fully truncated 4-point Green function which encompasses all Bethe\u2013Salpeter irreducible\nFeynman diagrams for two-particle into two-particle scattering and depends on the relative\nmomenta of initial and final scattering states, p and q, as well as on the total momentum P .\nThe instantaneous approximation to this formalism assumes that the kernel K depends\njust on the spatial components p and q of the relative momenta p and q: K(p, q) = K\u0302(p, q).\nIts application reduces Eq. (1) to the instantaneous version of the Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation\ni Z\ndp0 S1 (p1 ) I(p) S2 (\u2212p2 )\n(2)\n2\u03c0\nfor the Salpeter amplitude (defined by integration of \u03a8(p) over the time component p0 of p)\n\u03a6(p) =\n\n1\ndp0 \u03a8(p) ;\n2\u03c0\nhere the term involving the by assumption now instantaneous interaction is abbreviated by\nZ\n1\nI(p) \u2261\nd3 q K\u0302(p, q) \u03a6(q) .\n(2\u03c0)3\n\u03a6(p) \u2261\n\nZ\n\nThe fermion propagator Si (p) is the solution of the fermion Dyson\u2013Schwinger equation.\nBy Lorentz covariance Si (p) is defined by merely two (Lorentz-scalar) functions Mi (p2 ) and\nZi (p2 ), in QCD referred to as the quark wave-function renormalization and mass functions:\nSi (p) =\n\ni Zi (p2 )\n,\n6 p \u2212 Mi (p2 ) + i \u03b5\n\n6 p \u2261 p\u03bc \u03b3 \u03bc .\n\nIn the course of the derivation [3] of a generalization of the Salpeter equation towards exact\npropagators of all bound-state constituents, two of the present authors (W. L. and F. F. S.)\nassumed these functions, Mi (p2 ) and Zi (p2 ), to depend only on the spatial components p of\nthe momentum p. This allows to substitute Mi (p2 ) by Mi (p2 ) and Zi (p2 ) by Zi (p2 ) in Si (p).\nThen the integral in Eq. (2) over the time component p0 can be easily given analytically.\nIntroducing the one-particle energy Ei (p), the (generalized) Dirac Hamiltonian Hi (p), and\nthe energy projection operators \u039b\u00b1\ni (p) for positive or negative energy of particle i = 1, 2 by\nEi (p) \u2261\n\nq\n\ni = 1, 2 ,\n\nEi (p) \u00b1 Hi (p)\n,\n2 Ei (p)\n\ni = 1, 2 ,\n\np2 + Mi2 (p2 ) ,\n\nHi (p) \u2261 \u03b30 [\u03b3 * p + Mi (p2 )] ,\n\u039b\u00b1\ni (p) \u2261\n\ni = 1, 2 ,\n\n\f3\nfew rather standard manipulations yield [3] our instantaneous Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation for\nfermion\u2013antifermion bound states, with exact propagators of the bound-state constituents:\n\u03a6(p) =\n\nZ1 (p21 ) Z2(p22 )\n\n\u2212\n\u039b+\n\u039b\u2212 (p ) \u03b30 I(p) \u03b30 \u039b+\n1 (p1 ) \u03b30 I(p) \u03b30 \u039b2 (p2 )\n2 (p2 )\n.\n\u2212 1 1\nP0 \u2212 E1 (p1 ) \u2212 E2 (p2 )\nP0 + E1 (p1 ) + E2 (p2 )\n\n!\n\n(3)\n\n\u00b1\nFrom this, each amplitude \u03a6(p) has to satisfy the two constraints \u039b\u00b1\n1 (p1 ) \u03a6(p) \u039b2 (p2 ) = 0.\nWith little effort our bound-state equation (3) may be rephrased as eigenvalue problem,\n\nH1 (p1 ) \u03a6(p) \u2212 \u03a6(p) H2 (p2 )\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n+ Z1 (p21 ) Z2 (p22 ) [\u039b+\n1 (p1 ) \u03b30 I(p) \u03b30 \u039b2 (p2 ) \u2212 \u039b1 (p1 ) \u03b30 I(p) \u03b30 \u039b2 (p2 )]\n\n= P0 \u03a6(p) ,\nwith the bound state's energy P0 or, in its rest frame p2 = \u2212p1 , the mass MB as eigenvalue.\nThe Salpeter equation [2] is obtained by one further step of simplification. Its derivation\nassumes, in addition to the instantaneous approximation for K, that each exact propagator\nin Eq. (1) can be replaced by the propagator S0 (p, mi ) of a free particle of effective mass mi :\nSi (p) \u223c\n= S0 (p, mi ) =\n\ni\n6 p + mi\n,\n\u2261i 2\n6 p \u2212 mi + i \u03b5\np \u2212 m2i + i \u03b5\n\ni = 1, 2 .\n\nThus the Salpeter equation is recovered from Eq. (3) in the limit Mi (p2 ) \u2192 mi , Zi (p2 ) \u2192 1.\nThe exact-propagator instantaneous Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation (3) generalizes [3] Salpeter's\nequation by replacing mi by Mi (p2 ) and introducing factors Zi (p2 ) in the interaction terms.\n\n3\n\nQuark propagator from Dyson\u2013Schwinger equation\n\nWithin QCD the Dyson\u2013Schwinger equation for the quark propagator involves, besides the\nexact quark propagator, also the exact gluon propagator and the exact quark\u2013gluon vertex.\nThe Dyson\u2013Schwinger equations governing the two latter Green functions couple the quark\nDyson\u2013Schwinger equation to the infinite hierarchy of Dyson\u2013Schwinger equations. Hence,\na tractable problem can only be defined by some truncation of this set of integral equations.\nFor the present investigation we employ the so-called \"renormalization-group-improved\nrainbow\u2013ladder truncation\" scheme [4\u201324] applied to the quark Dyson\u2013Schwinger equation\nand the meson Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation. In this specific scheme the exact gluon propagator\nand the exact quark\u2013gluon vertex are replaced by their (perturbative) tree-level forms. The\ntruncation is consistent with the preservation of the axial-vector Ward\u2013Takahashi identity;\nthis is important for all questions related to chiral symmetry and its dynamical breakdown.\nIn this model, all the dynamical information is encoded in some effective coupling strength.\nViewed as function of the involved momentum transfer squared this effective coupling is\ncharacterized by two main features. In the ultraviolet region it approaches the perturbative\nbehaviour of the strong fine-structure constant, incorporating thereby asymptotic freedom.\nIn the infrared region it exhibits the significant enhancement demanded strongly by studies\nof the Dyson\u2013Schwinger equation satisfied by the exact gluon propagator. In the particular\nAnsatz for this effective coupling strength proposed in Ref. [4] this infrared enhancement is\nrepresented partly by the integrable singularity of a momentum-space \u03b4 function, partly by\na finite-width approximation to this \u03b4 function. This constitutes the \"model of our choice.\"\n\n\f4\nIn the comprehensive study presented in Ref. [4], the exact quark propagators emerging\nfrom this truncation model are found as numerical solutions of the quark Dyson\u2013Schwinger\nequation by fitting main properties of the \u03c0- and K-meson system. Like many treatments of\nDyson\u2013Schwinger equations the analysis of Ref. [4] has been performed in Euclidean space,\nimplying that the quark propagators are obtained as Euclidean-space Schwinger functions.\nWithin both QED and QCD, the analytic structure of the exact fermion propagators is still\nthe subject of intense investigations which did not provide a definitive conclusion until now\n(cf., for instance, Refs. [23,33,34] and references therein). In order to proceed, we must thus\nassume that the necessary analytic continuation from Euclidean to Minkowski space makes\nsense, at least for the quark propagators. In this case, the numerically computed functions\nM(p2 ) and Z(p2 ) in the propagator of the light u- and d-quarks may be represented (rather\naccurately in a range of spacelike momenta) in analytical form by the parametrizations [35]\na\nc\nM(p2 ) =\nZ(p2 ) = 1 \u2212\n;\n4 + m0 ,\np\np2\n1+\n1\u2212\nb\nd\nthe values of the parameters a, b, c, d, m0 are fixed by interpolation of the numerical results:\na = 0.745 GeV ,\nc = 0.545 ,\n\nb = (0.744 GeV)4 ,\n\nd = (1.85508 GeV)2 .\n\nm0 = 0.0055 GeV ,\n(4)\n\nThese propagator functions read in their \"p20 = 0\" approximation required for an analytical\nformulation of the bound-state equation (3) proposed [3] as a generalized Salpeter equation\nc\na\nZ(p2 ) = 1 \u2212\n.\n(5)\nM(p2 ) =\n4 + m0 ,\np\np2\n1+\n1+\nb\nd\n2\nThe behaviour of the quark propagator functions M(p ) and Z(p2 ) as functions of p2 is\ndepicted in Fig. 1. For light quarks the mass function M(p2 ) is, of course, dominated by the\nnonperturbative mechanism responsible for dynamical chiral-symmetry breaking. Starting\nat M(0) = 0.7505 GeV, M(p2 ) drops in the vicinity of p2 = (0.57 GeV)2 by more than two\norders of magnitude, in order to approach in the limit p2 \u2192 \u221e the (comparatively tiny but\nstill nonvanishing and hence explicitly chiral-symmetry breaking) current light-quark mass\nm0 = 0.0055 GeV. In contrast to such drastic variation, the wave-function renormalization\nfunction Z(p2 ) exhibits an only rather moderate dependence on p2 . With increasing values\nof p2 , Z(p2 ) rises slowly from Z(0) = 0.455 to its asymptotic value Z(p2 ) \u2192 1 for p2 \u2192 \u221e.\nWithin the \"renormalization-group-improved rainbow\u2013ladder truncation\" scheme, it is\nby no means mandatory to implement, as done in the model studied in Refs. [4\u20137,10,11,24],\nthe infrared enhancement in the effective interaction by the sum of an integrable \u03b4 function\nsingularity and its finite-width approximation. The results of the investigations reported in\nRefs. [8,9,13\u201318,20,23] demonstrate that propagator functions of very similar shape will be\nobtained in a model in which the infrared enhancement of the effective-interaction coupling\nrequired by hadron phenomenology is provided only by the finite-width representation [12].\nMoreover, the predictions for the propagator functions M(p2 ) and Z(p2 ) of both models\n[4,8] for the effective coupling in the quark Dyson\u2013Schwinger equation exhibit a remarkable\nqualitative and quantitative agreement with the results produced by lattice gauge theories.\nA recent unquenched lattice calculation of the quark propagator in Landau gauge involving\ntwo degenerate light (u/d) and one heavier (s) dynamical quarks may be found in Ref.

For our 1 JJ states only two\nof the latter, \u03a61 (p) and \u03a62 (p), are relevant. With our notation for one-particle energy E(p)\nand (generalized) Dirac Hamiltonian H(p) introduced in Sec. 2 the corresponding Salpeter\namplitude \u03a6(p) reads in the center-of-momentum frame of the particle\u2013antiparticle system\n\"\n\n#\n\nH(p)\n\u03a6(p) = \u03a61 (p)\n+ \u03a62 (p) \u03b35 .\nE(p)\nWithout loss of generality but for definiteness, focus to exactly the same physical system as\nstudied in Refs.

As noted in Sec. 2, Salpeter's equation corresponds to the free-propagator\napproximation Z(p2 ) \u223c\n= m. Thus the studies reported in Refs. [29\u201332] could\n= 1 and M(p2 ) \u223c\nget the matrix, for a large class of interactions, in algebraic form. Due to the presence of the\ntrue quark propagator functions Z(p2 ) and M(p2 ), in general this is no longer possible here.\nUpon construction of one Salpeter component, \u03a62 (p), as solution of Eq. (7), its companion,\n\u03a61 (p), follows, for MB 6= 0, immediately from the first of the two coupled equations (6). For\nvanishing bound-state mass, MB = 0, Eqs. (6) decouple and are thus solved independently.\n\n5\n\nLinear confinement: results and discussion\n\nLet us eventually apply the formalism developed in Secs. 2 through 4 to a confining (static)\npotential of linear shape, V (r) = \u03bb r, with slope \u03bb = 0.2 GeV2 . For confining interactions a\ntime-component Lorentz-vector structure of the kernel appears to be free of all the stability\nproblems encountered by solutions found for a kernel of Lorentz-scalar structure [27,38,39].\nOur first goal is to analyze the effect of the dynamical generation of quark masses on the\nsolutions of the instantaneous Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation (3) with exact propagators. To this\nend, Fig. 2 compares, for the three lowest positive-norm J P C = 0\u2212+ bound states, the mass\neigenvalues MB of Eq. (3) for exact light-quark propagators with m0 = 0 (corresponding to\nthe chiral limit of QCD) with those of a Salpeter equation for massless constituents [29,30].\nThe chosen bases for the Hilbert space L2 (R+ ) of all with the weight function w(r) = r 2\nsquare-integrable (\"radial\") functions on the positive real line R+ introduce one additional\ndegree of freedom, by allowing the basis states to depend on a variational parameter \u03bc > 0.\nAs a basis, these vectors constitute a complete orthonormal system for any particular value\nof \u03bc. Therefore, as long as relying exclusively on expansions over the full set of basis vectors\nour results may be expected to be independent of \u03bc. Necessary truncations of expansions to\na finite number of basis vectors will induce a certain amount of \u03bc-dependence of the results.\nHowever, a reasonable technique involving expansions should exhibit stability with respect\nto the increase of the number of basis vectors. If taking into account a large enough number\nof basis vectors, by reducing the dependence on \u03bc some \"region of stability\" should emerge.\n\n\f8\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n3.5\n\n3.5\n\nMB @GeVD\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2.5\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\u039c @GeVD\n\nFigure 2: Bound-state masses MB (as functions of our variational parameter \u03bc) of the three\nlowest-lying (positive-norm) J P C = 0\u2212+ eigenstates of our exact-propagator instantaneous\nBethe\u2013Salpeter equation (3) for the propagator parametrization (5) but m0 = 0 (full lines)\nand of the Salpeter equation for massless constituents (dashed lines), for a time-component\nLorentz-vector kernel representing some linear potential V (r) = \u03bb r of slope \u03bb = 0.2 GeV2 .\nThese results arise from diagonalization, for given values of \u03bc, of 50\u00d750 matrices equivalent\nto our exact-propagator equation but, mimicking Ref. [29], only 15\u00d715 matrices equivalent\nto Salpeter's equation and in both cases 50 terms in all intermediate-step series expansions.\n\n\f9\nWith respect to the mass MB of a given bound state, such a region of stability manifests\nitself in form of a plateau where the numerical value predicted for MB is constant over some\nnonvanishing range of \u03bc. Beyond doubt, the formation of these plateaus is obvious in Fig. 2.\nSuch extrema of MB disclose the bound states. Compared with the free-propagator results,\nthe ground state of Eq. (3) is higher but its radial excitations are lower, to the effect that all\nlevel spacings are significantly smaller if using exact propagators. In general, it is, of course,\nnot possible to compensate for these shifts by some change of the parameter values entering\nin the interaction kernel. For instance, a reduction of the slope \u03bb of the linear potential by a\nfactor 2 to \u03bb \u223c\n= 0.1 GeV2 lowers the ground-state energy eigenvalue of Eq. (3) to the level of\nits Salpeter-equation counterpart but simultaneously diminishes the level spacings further.\nTable 1 lists the masses MB of the three lowest-lying (positive-norm) J P C = 0\u2212+ bound\nstates calculated from the exact-propagator instantaneous Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation (3) for\nthe full (m0 6= 0) parametrization (5) and (4) of the exact light-quark propagators. Because\nof the relative smallness of the (explicitly chiral-symmetry breaking) current mass m0 these\neigenvalues are, of course, less than some 0.5% larger than the corresponding \"chiral-limit\"\nvalues forming the stability plateaus discernible in Fig. 2. These mass values are confronted\nin Table 1 with the corresponding mass eigenvalues MB of the Salpeter equation, computed\nby assuming, for the constituent mass m of the light u- and d-quarks entering their effective\npropagators, the typical value of m = 0.336 GeV frequently adopted by nonrelativistic and\nrelativistic constituent quark models to describe hadrons as bound states of quarks [40,41].\nRaising in the Salpeter equation the constituent quark mass m from m = 0 to the canonical\nvalue m = 0.336 GeV shifts the masses MB of the three lowest states by more than 0.1 GeV\ntowards larger values. The net result of this is a further increase of the discrepancy between\nthe level spacings predicted by the exact-propagator equation (3) and the ones arising from\nthe free-propagator Salpeter equation with some kind of appropriate or reasonable effective\nmass of the constituent quarks. Therefore, we are forced to conclude that any neglect of the\nproper behaviour of the momentum-dependent quark mass, M(p2 ), by approximating it by\na constant constituent mass m is, at least for the light u- and d-quarks, rather questionable.\nTable 1: Bound-state masses MB (in units of GeV) for the three lowest-lying positive-norm\nJ P C = 0\u2212+ eigenstates (denoted by 11 S0 , 21 S0 , 31 S0 , in usual spectroscopic notation) of our\nexact-propagator instantaneous Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation (3) with light-quark propagators\nparametrized by Eqs.

They are hardly distinguishable from each other for r > 5 GeV\u22121 for both \u03a61 (r) and\n\u03a62 (r). Thus we feel entitled to expect similar predictions for quantities such as decay rates.\n\n6\n\nSummary, conclusions, and outlook\n\nThe reduction of the Bethe\u2013Salpeter formalism to the Salpeter equation requires to assume\nfor all bound-state constituents not only an instantaneous interaction but also free-particle\npropagation. Realizing this fact, a bound-state equation that retains the exact propagators\nof the bound-state constituents and generalizes Salpeter's equation has been formulated by\nconsequent application of the instantaneous approximation to all exact propagators too [3].\nOf course, this may be extended to Bethe\u2013Salpeter equations for bound states composed of\nparticles that are not, or not all, identical to spin- 21 fermions as well as to three-dimensional\nreductions [42\u201345] of the Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation [1] different from Salpeter's equation [2].\nThe present investigation addressed the question of how realistic descriptions of mesons\nas quark\u2013antiquark bound states within a general instantaneous Bethe\u2013Salpeter formalism\nwill be modified by such reinstallment of the exact quark propagators, extracted from QCD\nby analytic continuation from Euclidean to Minkowski space. Interestingly, for the example\nof a specific interaction used already in earlier studies [27\u201332], we find a drastic shrinking of\nthe level spacings of the bound states while their amplitudes remain practically unchanged.\n\nAcknowledgements\nOne of us (W.
