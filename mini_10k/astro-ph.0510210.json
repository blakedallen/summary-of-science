We study galaxy correlations from samples extracted from the 2dFGRS final release. Statistical properties are characterized by studying the nearest neighbor probability density, the conditional density and the\nreduced two-point correlation function. The result is that the conditional density has a power-law behavior in\nredshift space described by an exponent \u03b3 = 0.8 \u00b1 0.2 in the interval from about 1 Mpc/h, the average distance\nbetween nearest galaxies, up to about 40 Mpc/h, corresponding to radius of the largest sphere contained in the\nsamples. These results are consistent with other studies of the conditional density and are useful to clarify the\nsubtle role of finite-size effects on the determination of the two-point correlation function in redshift and real\nspace.\nKey words. Cosmology: observations; large-scale structure of Universe;\n\n1. Introduction\nThe problem of the quantitative characterization of the\nlarge scale galaxy clustering has been intensively discussed\nin the last years, especially in relation to two new galaxy\nsurveys: the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS - York\net al., 2000) and the Two degree Field Galaxy Redshift\nSurvey (2dFGRS - Colless et al., 2003). These data represent a great improvement for our knowledge of the local\nuniverse: for example the number of measured redshifts\nhas grown of a factor ten with respect to the surveys completed in the last two decades. Moreover accurate redshift\ndeterminations and the multi-bands photometry allow one\na precise characterization of many parameters and effects\n(e.g. K corrections) which were poorly constrained up to\nfew years ago. It should however be noted that for some\nanalyses, like the ones we discuss here, a large solid angle\nis also required. This is still not the case for the present\ndata, but, for instance, the final release of the SDSS will\nprovide a large contiguous angular sky region in the very\nnear future.\nIn this paper we discuss the analysis of two-point correlation properties in the 2dFGRS sample. Up to now these\ndata were mainly analyzed by studying the reduced correlation function \u03be(r), in redshift and real space, and its\nFourier conjugate, the power spectrum (e.g. N'orberg et\nal. 2001, 2002; Tegmark, Hamilton & Xu 2002; Hawkins et\nal. 2003; Madgwick et al. 2003, Basilakos & Plionis 2003,\n\nCole et al. 2005). Recently Gaztanaga et al. (2005) present\nnew result for the 3-point correlation function measured\nas a function of scale, luminosity and color using the 2dFGRS sample.\nIn general, these statistical tools can be affected by\nfinite-size effects or luminosity dependent selection effects\n(e.g. Gabrielli et al., 2004) and, by using appropriate\nstatistics, one may perform several tests in order to disentangle different biases. Finite size effects can be very\nimportant for the determination of correlation properties\nin the regime of large fluctuations, which should be then\nclearly identified in the studies of galaxy samples. It is in\nfact well known that at small scales, observed galaxy structures are highly irregular and present two-point power-law\ncorrelations, in the regime of strong clustering. However\nthe search for the \"maximum\" size of galaxy structures\nand voids, beyond which the distribution becomes essentially uniform and fluctuations can be considered small\nperturbations with respect to the average density, is still\nan open problem (Tikhonov & Makarov 2003, Hogg et\nal. 2005, Joyce et al. 2005 and see for a recent review\nBaryshev & Teerikorpi 2005). It is evident that from the\ntheoretical point of view the understanding of the statistical characteristics of these structures represents the key\nelement to be considered by a physical theory dealing with\ntheir formation.\nA number of statistical methods can be used to study\ngalaxy distribution, the main ones involve the determina-\n\n\f2\n\nVasilyev et al.: Large scale correlations from the 2dFGRS\n\ntion of two-point properties although the study of the distribution function, containing information on higher order\ncorrelations, has also been found to be a powerful method\n(e.g. Sivakoff & Saslaw 2005). The primary questions in\ncorrelation analysis of three dimensional galaxy distributions are: (i) what is the value of the correlation exponent\nand (ii) which is the scale where the distribution becomes\nuniform and a crossover to homogeneity can be clearly\nidentified ? Such a scale can be defined, for example, to\nbe the one beyond which conditional counts of galaxies\nin three dimensional volumes of radius R grow as R3 .\nRecently Hogg et al. (2005), by considering the properties\nof a deep and complete sample of luminous red galaxies\nextracted from the SDSS survey, found that the transition\nfrom the strongly correlated regime to the uniform one occurs at about 70 Mpc/h1 , which is larger than, for example, results in the CfA1 redshift survey where the transition was found at about 20 Mpc/h (Davis & Peebles, 1983;\nsee Peebles 2001 for a recent discussion). Particularly, they\nhave measured the behavior of the conditional density in\nredshift space, finding that the exponent characterizing\npower law correlation is about \u03b3 \u2248 1 (instead of \u03b3 = 1.8\nas measured by Davis & Peebles 1983) up to 20-30 Mpc/h\nand that this is followed by a slow crossover toward homogeneity which is reached at about 70 Mpc/h. These\nresults are in good agreement with the ones presented in,\ne.g. Sylos Labini et al. (1998) (see Baryshev & Teerikorpi,\n2005 for a recent review) where the same value \u03b3 \u2248 1 was\nfound up to 20-30 Mpc/h and where at larger scales, with\na weaker statistics, an evidence for a compatibility with\nthe extension of such a behavior was found. In addition\nTikhonov, Makarov & Kopylov (2000) found similar results up to scales of \u223c 30 Mpc/h, and weaker evidences\nfor homogeneity at scales larger than 100 Mpc/h.\nIn this paper we present results of a correlation analysis of the 2dFGRS data studying the behavior of the\nconditional density and other statistics suitable to characterize properties of distributions with large fluctuations\nand control finite size effects. In Sec.2 we describe the procedure to construct samples which are not biased by the\nluminosity selection in apparent magnitudes (the so-called\nvolume limited - VL - samples). In Sec.3 we consider\nthe nearest neighbor probability density for the VL samples which allows us a characterization of small scales statistical properties. We then turn to the study of large scale\nin Sec.4 where we discuss the estimation of the conditional\ndensity and the result obtained in the VL samples. We discuss the relation of this statistical tool with the reduced\ntwo-point correlation function in Sec.5, where we compare\nour results with previous estimations of the same statistics, focusing on finite size effects and their implication for\nthe interpretation of galaxy correlations. Finally in Sec.6\nwe summarize our results and discuss its relation to other\nstudies and we draw our main conclusions.\n1\n\nNote that we use as Hubble constant the value H0 =100 h\nkm/sec/Mpc where h is 0.4 \u2264 h \u2264 0.7\n\n2. Volume limited subsamples\nThe 2dFGRS is the largest galaxy catalog completed at\nthe moment. The Final Release (Colless et al., 2003) contains more than 220 thousands of precisely measured redshifts of the galaxies located in two strips: about 140 thousands in the southern galactic pole (SGP), in a strip of\n90\u25e6 \u00d7 15\u25e6 and about 70 thousands in the strip 75\u25e6 \u00d7 10\u25e6\nin northern galactic pole (NGP) In addition the survey\ncontains 10 thousands in the random fields which are not\nused in this paper.\nThe median redshift of galaxies is z \u2243 0.1 and most of\nthe galaxies have z < 0.3. The bJ magnitude corrected for\nthe galactic extinction is limited as 14.0 < bJ < 19.45.\n\n2.1. Selection of subsamples\nTo avoid the effect of the irregular edges in the angular\ncoordinates, due to the survey geometry, we set the following limits in right ascension and declination in order\nto get rectangular (in \u03b1, \u03b4 coordinates) shape on the sky:\n\u2013 SGP: 84\u25e6 \u00d7 9\u25e6 (\u221233\u25e6 < \u03b4 < \u221224\u25e6, \u221232\u25e6 < \u03b1 < 52\u25e6 )\n\u2013 NGP: 60\u25e6 \u00d7 6\u25e6 (\u22124\u25e6 < \u03b4 < 2\u25e6 , 150\u25e6 < \u03b1 < 210\u25e6 )\nWe select galaxies in the redshift interval 0.01 \u2264 z \u2264\n0.3 and with redshift quality parameter such that Q \u2265 3\nin order to have high quality redshifts (see discussion in\nHawkins et al. 2003).\nWe do not use a correction for the redshift completeness mask and for the fiber collision effects. In fact, completeness varies mostly nearby the survey edges which are\nexcluded in our sample. We assume that fiber collisions do\nnot make a sensible change in the small scales correlation\nproperties as we set our lower cut-off to 0.5 Mpc/h which\nis larger than 0.1 Mpc/h used by Hawkins et al. (2003).\nTo construct VL subsamples first we compute metric\ndistances as\nZ 1\nc\ndy\nr(z) =\n,\n(1)\n1/2\n1\nH0 1+z\ny * (\u03a9M /y + \u03a9\u039b * y 2 )\nwhere we use the standard model parameters \u03a9M = 0.3\nand \u03a9\u039b = 0.7. The absolute magnitude can be computed\nas\nM = bJ \u2212 5 * log10 [r(z) * (1 + z)] \u2212 Ki (z) \u2212 25.\n\n(2)\n\nTo calculate the K-correction Ki (z) (the index i defines\nthe galaxy type) we used formulas obtained by Madgwick\net al. (2002):\nK1 (z)\nK2 (z)\nK3 (z)\nK4 (z)\nKavg (z)\n\n= 2.6z + 4.3z 2\n= 1.9z + 2.2z 2\n= 1.3z + 2.0z 2\n= 0.9z + 2.3z 2\n= 1.9z + 2.7z 2\n\n(E/S0)\n(Sa/Sb)\n(Sc/Sd)\n(Irr)\n(average)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere 1, 2, 3, 4 indexes represent the spectral types of the\ngalaxies (in parenthesis in Eq.3), and the average value\nKavg (z) is used for the galaxies with the undefined spectral type.\n\n\fVasilyev et al.: Large scale correlations from the 2dFGRS\n\n3\n\n2\n\ndN/dr\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\nc4\nc5\nc6\nc7\nD=3.7\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1.3e+02\n\nFig. 1.

Definition of volume limited subsamples\nTo take into account the selection effect that arises due to\nthe 2dFGRS apparent magnitude limits 14 < bJ < 19.45,\none has to consider two limits for the metric distance\nrmin < r < rmax and compute the two corresponding limits for the absolute magnitude Mmin (rmin ) and\nMmax (rmax ) which represent the lower and the upper limit\nfor the galaxies contained in a VL sample.\nTo this aim, we select three distance intervals (50-250\nMpc/h, 100-400 Mpc/h and 150-550 Mpc/h) and compute the corresponding absolute magnitude limits for each\nof two strips. Thus we get three VL subsamples for the\nNorthern hemisphere and three for Southern hemisphere\nwhose main parameters are presented Table 1. (Note that\nhereafter we set h = 1 unless specified). An example of the\ndistance-magnitude limits for the SGP400 sample (which\nindeed is the largest one considered in this paper) is shown\nin Fig. 1. In Fig 2 we show the behavior of the differential\nnumber counts dN (r)/dr as a function of distance in different sky areas for the sample SGP400. Particularly we\nput limits respectively at \u03b4 \u2264 \u221227\u25e6 (c4), \u03b4 > \u221227\u25e6 (c5),\n\u03b1 \u2265 189\u25e6 (c6) and \u03b1 \u2265 189\u25e6 (c7). As an example we report\nthe best fit for the sample c4, which show an exponent corresponding to a metric dimension larger (D = 3.7) than\nthe space dimension. This is a purely finite-size effect corresponding to the large fluctuations still visible at scales\nof order 100 Mpc/h.\n\n3. Nearest neighbor probability density\nIn a stochastic point process the probability \u03c9(r)dr that\nthe nearest neighbor to a given particle lies at a distance in\nthe range [r, r+dr] can provide a useful characterization of\n\n1.7e+02\n\nr\n\n2.3e+02\n\n3e+02\n\nFig. 2.

Estimation of correlations: the conditional\ndensity\nIn general, in a distribution of points with large fluctuations at some scales, one may determinate two-point correlations through the estimation of the conditional density (see discussion in Gabrielli et al. (2004)). We first\nbriefly summarize the main properties of this statistical\ntool stressing the finite size effects and statistical errors\n\nhN (r)iP\n.\nkC(r)k\n\n(8)\n\nThis quantity measures the average number of points\nhN (r)iP contained in a sphere of volume kC(r)k = 43 \u03c0r3\nwith the condition that the center of the sphere lies on an\noccupied point of the distribution (and h...iP denotes the\nconditional ensemble average).\nSuch a quantity can be estimated in a finite sample\nby a volume average (supposing stationarity of the point\ndistribution)\n\n\u0393\u2217E (r) =\n\nNc (r)\nX Ni (r)\nN (r)P\n1\n=\n,\nkC(r)k\nNc (r) i=1 kC(r)k\n\n(9)\n\nwhere Nc (r) - the number of points (centers) with balls\nfully contained in the sample volume, (...)P means averaging by the sample points.\nGiven a sample of arbitrary geometry and a scale r\nat which correlations are measured, only a subsample of\nthe points contained in it will satisfy the following requirement: when chosen as center of a sphere of radius r,\nthe sphere is fully contained in the sample volume. When\nthe average in Eq.9 is made over such a subsample one is\nconsidering the full-shell estimator of the conditional density. Note that the number of center Nc (r) is a function\nof the scale r at which correlations are estimated. In fact\nfor scales much smaller than the radius rsm of the largest\nsphere fully contained in the sample volume, almost all\npoints will contribute to the average, while at scales comparable to the sample size only those points lying in the\ncenter of the sample volume will contribute. Thus finitesize effect can be important when one considers the largest\navailable scales: in this situation one cannot make a full\nvolume average and systematic effect, due to large fluctuations, can be important in the determination of such a\nstatistics.\nThe scale rsm will in general be very different from the\nscales rmin and rmax characterizing a VL sample, as it\ndepends crucially on the sample solid angle. On the other\nhand the minimal scale rsep up to which correlations can\nbe measured, is given by the average distance between\nneighbor galaxies: clearly for r < rsep discrete shot-noise\ndominates estimations of any statistical quantity. Thus we\nwill explicitly compute the scales rsep and rsm for the VL\nconsidered in what follows (see Tab.2).\n\n\fVasilyev et al.: Large scale correlations from the 2dFGRS\nVL sample\nNGP250\nNGP400\nNGP550\nSGP250\nSGP400\nSGP550\n\n4.2. Conditional density in shells \u0393(r)\nThe conditional density in spherical shells is defined as\n\u0393(r) =\n\nhN (r, \u2206r)iP\n,\nkC(r, \u2206r)k\n\n(10)\n\nwhere hN (r, \u2206r)iP represents the ensemble average number of points in a sphere of radius r and thickness \u2206r, of\nvolume kC(r, \u2206r)k = 34 \u03c0[(r + \u2206r)3 \u2212 r3 ], around a point\nof distribution (and thus this is a conditional ensemble\naverage h...iP as in the previous case). Note that one can\nalso write Eq.10 as\n\u0393(r) =\n\nhn(r)n(0)i\nhn(0)i\n\n(11)\n\nX\ni=1\n\nwhere we consider again only the full-shell estimator, i.e.\nfor which Nc (r+\u2206r) represents the number of points (centers) contained in spherical shells fully contained in the\nsample volume. Analogously to the case of \u0393\u2217 (r) particular care should be used to determine the scales rsep and\nrsm .\nIt is instructive to notice that for the case where the\ndistributions has power-law correlations and strong fluctuations (e.g. a fractal structure) then the conditional density in spheres behaves (in the ensemble average) as\n(13)\n\nwhile conditional density in shells has the form\n\u0393(r) =\n\n(3 \u2212 \u03b3)B \u2212\u03b3\nr .\n4\u03c0\n\nSGP250\nSGP400\nSGP550\nNGP250\nNGP400\nNGP550\n-0.8\nr\n\n-1\n\n10\n\nNi (r, \u2206r)\n, (12)\nkC(r, \u2206r)k\n\n3B \u2212\u03b3\n\u0393\u2217 (r) =\nr ,\n4\u03c0\n\nrsm\n12.4\n19.9\n27.4\n18.2\n29.1\n40.0\n\n\u2217\n\nNc (r+\u2206r)\n\nrsep , Poisson\n2.0\n2.6\n3.9\n2.4\n3.0\n4.2\n\n\u0393 (r)\n\nN (r, \u2206r)P\n1\n=\nkC(r, \u2206r)k\nNc (r + \u2206r)\n\nrsep , 2dFGRS\n1.3\n1.7\n2.7\n1.5\n1.9\n2.8\n\nTable 2.

Application to 2dFGRS data\nIn Tab.2 we show, for the different VL samples considered, the lower and upper cut-off, previously discussed,\nbetween which we have estimated \u0393(r) and \u0393\u2217 (r). Note\nthat we have generated a Poisson distribution, for each\nVL sample, with the same number of points and in the\nsame three dimensional volume in order to estimate the\nsame statistical quantities in a distribution without correlation at all. This provide us with a useful way to test our\nanalysis with the simplest distribution with known properties.

However a difference in the\namplitude is present for all but the largest sample. The\namplitude of \u0393\u2217 (r) is related to the luminosity function in\nthe following way.\nIn general one has that the joint conditional probability of finding a galaxy of luminosity L at distance r from\nanother galaxy, i.e. the (ensemble) conditional average\nnumber of galaxies with luminosity in the range [L, L+dL]\nand in the volume element d3 r at distance r from an observer located on a galaxy is given by h\u03bd(L, r)ip d3 rdL.\nOne can then assume that\nh\u03bd(L, r)ip = \u03c6(L) \u00d7 \u0393(r) ,\n\n(15)\n\n\f6\n\nVasilyev et al.: Large scale correlations from the 2dFGRS\n\nSGP250\nSGP400\nSGP550\nNGP250\nNGP400\nNGP550\n-0.8\nr\n\n1\n\nSGP250\nSGP400\nSGP550\nNGP250\nNGP400\nNGP550\n-0.7\nr\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n\u2217\n\n\u0393(r)\n\n\u0393 (r)\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n0\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u0393\u2217i (r) represents the determination from the ith\npoint.

However one should notice that at large scales\n(usually the last few points) estimators of \u0393\u2217 (r) have large\nscatterings because of the small number of points con-\n\nFig. 6.

By writing Eq.15 as a product of the\nconditional space density for the luminosity function, one\nhas implicitly assumed that galaxy positions are independent of galaxy luminosity. Thus from Eq.15 it follows that\nthe amplitude of \u0393\u2217 (r) in a VL sample is given by an integral of the luminosity function over the range of absolute\nluminosity covered by the sample multiplied by the conditional density for all galaxies. Amplitude variations in\nthe same VL samples in the NGP and SGP can be due to\nlarge local fluctuations which are not averaged out by the\nvolume average. Thus these differences can be probably\nascribed to finite size effects. The fact that in the deepest VL samples (i.e. the ones cut at 550 Mpc/h), where\nthe volume is the largest, the conditional density does not\nshow significant differences between the two hemispheres\nsupports the finite-size interpretation.\nIf one fits the behavior of the estimated \u0393\u2217 (r) with\na power-law function of the type Br\u2212\u03b3 one finds that\n\u03b3 = 0.8 \u00b1 0.2. In Fig.5 we have normalized the conditional\ndensity is spheres to the value at 10 Mpc/h. In this way it\nis apparent the fact that the slope variates in the different\nsamples: the variation is of about 0.1. The formal statistical error for the determination of \u0393\u2217 (r) at each scale can\nbe simply derived from the dispersion of the average\nN \u22121\n2\n1 X (\u0393\u2217i (r) \u2212 \u0393\u2217 (r))\nN i=1\nN \u22121\n\n1\n\n10\n\nr (Mpc/h)\n\nFig. 5.

The reference line has a power-law\nbehavior with slope \u03b3 = 0.7.\n\ntributing to the average. Moreover in this estimation one\ncannot take into account systematic variations due to the\nfact that the volume average cannot be performed at large\nscales (see discussion in Joyce, Montuori & Sylos Labini\n1999). For these reasons the behavior for scale larger than\n\u223c 20 Mpc/h is affected by large un-averaged fluctuations.\nWe show in Fig.6 the behavior of the conditional density in shells and in Fig.7 the conditional density in shells\nnormalized to the value at 10 Mpc/h. It is clear that these\nestimations are more affected by statistical noise. An important parameter in this respect is represented by the\nshell thickness which we take constant in logarithmic scale.\nIn this case the average slope is \u03b3 = 0.8 \u00b1 0.2 up to 30\nMpc/h.\n\n\fVasilyev et al.: Large scale correlations from the 2dFGRS\n\n5.

The last equality\nfollows from the very definition of the conditional density\n(see Eq.10).\nThere are several estimators of \u03be(r) and we refer to\nKerscher, Szapudi & Szalay (2000) and Gabrielli et al.\n(2004) for a detailed discussion of the different ones used\nin the literature. One may consider, for example, the\nLandy & Szalay (1993) (LS) estimator that is the most\nwidespread in modern studies of correlation function for\nlarge scale structures because it is the minimal variance\nestimator for a Poisson distribution. This can be written\nas (Kerscher, Szapudi & Szalay al. 2000):\n\u03beLS (r) =\n\nNR \u2212 1 DR(r)\nNR (NR \u2212 1) DD(r)\n\u22122\n+ 1, (18)\nND (ND \u2212 1) RR(r)\nND RR(r)\n\nwhere ND - the number of data (sample) points; NR -\nthe number of random points homogeneously distributed\nin the sample geometry; DD(r) is the number data-data\npairs, DR(r) - data-random pairs and RR(r) - randomrandom pairs respectively. Note that in the artificial random catalogs generated for the estimation of Eq.18, we\nhave used a number points in the range 4.5-9104. However\nthe LS estimator can be biased by finite-size effects in the\ncase of strongly correlated distributions as we discuss in\nwhat follows:we have tested that also for the estimator introduced by Davis & Peebles (1983) the situation is substantially the same.\nAnalogously to the full-shell estimator of the conditional density, one may define the following (full-shell) estimator of \u03be(r) which can be induced directly from Eq.17\n\u03beF S (r) =\n\n\u0393E (r)\n\u22121.\n\u0393\u2217E (rsm )\n\n(19)\n\nwhere \u0393E (r) is the estimator of the conditional density\nin shells and \u0393\u2217E (rsm ) is the estimator of the conditional\ndensity in spheres at the scale of the sample rsm . Although\nthe latter quantity is not, in general, computed through\nan average because only a single point may contribute at\nsuch large scales, this estimator, when the properties of the\ndistribution are unknown and likely to be characterized by\nstrong fluctuations, has several advantages with respect to\nthe LS (or also the one used by Davis & Peebles, 1983).\nWe notice that by using the full-shell estimator we are\nable to make a very conservative measurement of the twopoint correlation function. In fact, for example, one does\nnot need to make estimations of correlations on scales\nlarger than rsm which require use of weighing schemes and\nspecial treatment of boundary conditions. The main point\n\n\u03be(r)\n\nThe reduced two-point correlation function \u03be(r) for a\nstochastic point process is defined (see e.g. Peebles, 1980)\nas\n0\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\nr (Mpc/h)\nFig. 8. Estimation of the two-point reduced correlation\nfunction in the different VL samples considered by using\nthe full shell estimator. The reference line has a power-law\nbehavior with slope \u03b3 = 0.75.\nis however that the estimation of the sample density is performed on \"local\" scales, i.e. much smaller than the global\nscale of the sample. In addition Eq.19 satisfies the simple\nconstraint\nZ rsm\n\u03beF S (r)r2 dr = 0\n(20)\n0\n\nwhich is the so-called \"integral constraint\". Any estimator of \u03be(r) must satisfy a similar condition which comes\nfrom the fact that the average density has been estimated\nfrom the given sample. (Note that we do not use any additional correction to take into account for this particular\neffect: in the case of the full-shell estimator the integral\nconstraint has a clear effect given by Eq.20. For the case\nof the LS estimator we have not used any correction to\ntake into account for this constraint.) It is however clear\nthat Eq.20 gives us a simple way of controlling this offset,\nwhich is not the case for another estimator. It is important to stress that the estimation of the sample average\nis subjected to large fluctuations because its determination does not involve any average. Such fluctuations will\nsubstantially alter the amplitude of the reduced correlation function as we discuss below: this is a good reason\nto measure statistical quantities, like \u0393(r), which are not\naffected by such fluctuations.\nThe behavior of \u03beF S (r) is presented on Fig. 8. We note\ntwo main properties: the first one is that the amplitude of\n\u03be(r) changes in different samples and the second is that the\nexponent in the strongly clustered regime (i.e. \u03be(r) \u226b 1)\nis about \u03b3 = 0.75. Both results are in qualitative agreement with other analysis of the same samples. For example Hawkins et al. (2003) found that in the full magnitude\nlimited sample, the redshift space value of the correlation\nexponent is \u03b3 = 0.75 in the range [0.1,4] Mpc/h and then\n\u03b3 = 1.75 in the range [4,10] Mpc/h (see their Fig.6). This\nis for example what we find in the SGP250 sample as\n\n\f8\n\nVasilyev et al.: Large scale correlations from the 2dFGRS\n1\n\nAs these fluctuations can be large and dependent on the\nspecific sample considered, it is difficult to make a more\nquantitative comparison between our and other results.\nIt is also very interesting to note that the zero-crossing\nscale rzc of \u03be(r), shown by a sharp decay at the scale rzc of\n\u03beE (r) in a log-log plot, depends on the sample size. This result can be again explained as finite size effect introduced\nby Eq.20. This is an important feature especially in the\ncomparison between observations and numerical N-body\nsimulations (see Sylos Labini 2005 for more detail).\nConcerning the amplitude, we note that Norberg et al.\n(2001) found a similar variation of the redshift-space \u03be(r).\nThis is consistent with the results discussed here. The difference lies in the way these results are interpreted. In\nfact, while Norberg et al. (2001) ascribe the different amplitudes to different selections in luminosity (or spectral\ntype, or colors, etc.), we discuss below that, given the behavior of the conditional density, such variations can be\neasily explained as a finite size effect.\n\n10\n\n\u03be(r)\n\nSGP250\n-0.75\nr\n-1.57\nr\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\nr (Mpc/h)\nFig. 9.

It is worth noticing that the slopes measured in different VL sample may variate as it is shown,\nfor example, by the SGP400 in Fig.10. It is interesting to\nnote that in other surveys different values of \u03b3, in redshift\nspace, have been found: for example in the CfA1 catalog \u03b3 = 1.8 in the range [0.1,5] Mpc/h (Davis & Peebles\n1983). As discussed below we ascribe this change of slope,\nas the variation of the amplitude of \u03be(r), to a finite size effect. For this reason, while the qualitative behavior of the\nvariation of the amplitude and exponent of \u03be(r) is similar to many other estimations (e.g. Hawkins et al., 2003;\nNorberg et al. 2001), the quantitative comparison depends\non the sample size and, most importantly, on the fluctuations which affect the determination of the sample density.\n\nIn order to directly show the importance of finite size effects, and illustrate their role in a specific example, we\nhave considered the sample SGP400 and constructed some\ndifferent subsamples. In all cases the other boundaries in\n\u03b1, \u03b4, r remain the same as for the original sample while an\nadditional cut has been imposed. The sample C1 is cut at\nr \u2264 250 Mpc/h, C2 at r \u2264 300 Mpc/h, C3 at r \u2264 350\nMpc/h, C4 at \u03b4 \u2264 \u22120.5 radiant, C5 at \u03b4 \u2265 \u22120.5 radiant, C6 at \u03b1 \u2265 3.3 radiant, C7 at \u03b1 \u2264 3.3 radiant and\nC8 at r \u2264 315 Mpc/h. Note that in these subsamples the\nlower cut-off remains the same as for the full SGP400,\nwhile the upper cut-off changes: in what follows we focus\non how the finite size effect at large scales influence the\namplitude of the \u03be-function. The results obtained by the\nLandy-Szalay estimator (Eq.18) are shown in Fig.11 One\nmay note that the amplitude of \u03beE (r) varies in the different subsamples. Note that we refer to the amplitude\nvariation of \u03be(r) as shown by Fig.11 without making a\ndetailed analysis of the power-law exponent and the corresponding amplitude). The reason for this choice lies in\nthe insignificant values of formal statistical errors along\nwith large systematical errors (especially at large scales)\ndue to the finite volume and single realization. Instead\nof performing precise estimation of r0 and \u03b3 we simply\ndemonstrate the general behavior of \u03be-function. This variation is due to fluctuations in the large scale distribution\nof galaxies and thus they are volume dependent effects.\nTherefore the amplitude of \u03be(r) is affected by finite-size\neffects as long as the distribution has not been found to\nhave relaxed to an uniform system. From the one hand the\nLandy-Szalay estimator uses a sample density computed\non the global sample scale, thus introducing a mixture of\nlarge scales and small scales properties in the measure of\ncorrelations. From the other hand, although the sample\ndepth is of order of hundreds Mpc/h, finite size effects, re-\n\n\fVasilyev et al.: Large scale correlations from the 2dFGRS\n1.4\n\nlocal slope becomes 2\u03b3 (see Fig.9). In fact, Hawkins et al.\n(2003) fitted the slope around the scale r0 in the different\nsamples (see their Tab.1) with the consistent result that\nthe slope is 1.6.\nMoreover we would like to remark the crucial point\nthat \u0393\u2217E (rsm ) can differ from Eq.21 in a single sample determination: while the latter is the expectation value for\nthe ensemble average quantity, the former quantity is subjected to large finite size fluctuations. This implies that the\nscaling of the amplitude of \u03beF S (r) does not hold precisely\nin a single measurement, while this is the expectation in\nan ensemble of realizations (which is not possible to obtain\nin the analysis of a single sample).\n\nAll\nC1\nC2\nC3\nC4\nC5\nC6\nC7\nC8\n6.1\n7.7\n\n1.2\n\n\u03be(r)\n\n1\n\n0.83\n\n0.69\n\n0.58\n5.9\n\n6.3\n\n6.8\n\nr\n\n7.4\n\n8\n\n8.6\n\n5.2.

The use of the conditional density avoids both\nthese problems.\nIn order to explain the amplitude and slope variation\nobserved by the estimation of two-properties by \u03be(r) we\nintroduce a simple toy model which may capture the main\nelement of the problem. However one may repeat the following argument for any distribution, and thus for any\nfunctional behavior of the conditional density, one finds\nin the data. The point is that in the regime of strong clustering, evidenced by the range of scales where \u0393(r) has\nnot reached a clear flattening behavior, the determination\nof \u03be(r) and thus of the average density, is sample size dependent.\nIf the conditional density has a power-law behavior up\nto the size rsm of the type\n\u0393(r) = Br\u2212\u03b3\n\n(21)\n\nwith 0 < \u03b3 < 3 then the estimation of the sample average\nthrough the conditional density in spheres is\nZ rsm\n3B\n3\n\u0393(r)4\u03c0r2 dr =\n(rm )\u2212\u03b3 .(22)\n\u0393\u2217 (rsm ) =\n4\u03c0(rsm )3 0\n3\u2212\u03b3 s\nThus from Eq.19 we find that\n\u0012 \u0013\u2212\u03b3\n3\u2212\u03b3\nr\n\u03beF S (r) =\n\u22121.\n3\nrsm\n\n9\n\n(23)\n\nOne may note that Eq.23 easily takes into account both\nthe amplitude variation in samples of different size, and\nthe change of the slope as a function of scale (due to the\ndifferent regime of strong correlation where the fit with a\npower-law is possible). From Eq.23 one may note that the\nslope depends on scale in a continuous way: for example\nat r = r0 such that \u03beF S (r0 ) = 1 one easily derives that the\n\nConcerning the real space properties, we have not directly\nmeasured them here. However we may notice that the\nsame finite-size effects which perturb the redshift space\nreduced two-point correlation function may affect the projected one (usually called \u03c9(rp ) - see e.g. Davis & Peebles\n1983). In general, one may relate the real space \u03beRS (R) to\nthe projected \u03c9(rp ), where rp represents the projection of\nthe redshift space distance on a direction perpendicular to\nthe line of sight, through the following equation\nZ \u221e\n\u03beRS (y)y\nq\ndy .\n(24)\n\u03c9(rp ) = 2\nrp\ny 2 \u2212 rp2\nLet us now consider the following situation: if the real\nspace conditional density has the behavior \u0393RS (R) =\nAR\u2212\u03b3 then we can repeat the argument which yields to\nEq.23 with the result that\n\u0012 \u0013\u2212\u03b3\n3\u2212\u03b3 R\n\u03beRS (R) =\n\u22121\n(25)\n3\nrsm\nwhere rsm is the sample depth, as discussed. Thus the real\nspace \u03beRS (R) shows the same finite-size effects present\nin the redshift space correlation function previously discussed. If \u03beRS (R) has a pure power-law behavior with\n\u03b3 > 1 then from Eq.24 one gets\n\u03c9(rp ) \u223c rp1\u2212\u03b3 .\n\n(26)\n\nIn the present situation this is not the case, because the\nsecond term in Eq.25 gives an infinite contribution when\nintegrated over all space. In practice however one truncates the integral to scales of order of rsm and one expects\nto recover Eq.26 only at small enough scales.

For\nexample for \u03b3 = 0.8 we get from Eq.25 and Eq.27 the behavior shown in Fig.12, which is very similar to the one\nmeasured by Hawkins et al. (2003).

Note that a similar finite-size\neffect may be present in the measurement of the angular\ntwo-point correlation function (see e.g., Montuori & Sylos\nLabini 1997). While we are clearly not able to make a\ndefinitive statement about whether the behavior of \u03c9(rp )\nfound by, for instance, Hawkins et al. (2003), is perturbed\nby systematic biases, our analysis shows that one needs to\nconsider finite size effects explicitly also for the computation of the real space properties.\n\n6. Discussion\nWe have studied redshift space correlation properties of six\nvolume limited samples extracted from the 2dFGRS. We\nhave considered several statistical properties. Particularly\nthe characterization of small-scale properties through the\nnearest neighbor probability density allow us the determination of the smallest scale up to which correlations properties can be studied in a robust way. In fact, at scales\nsmaller than the average distance between nearest neighbors, typically in the range of few Mpc/h (see Tab.2),\ndiscrete shot noise dominates the measurements leading\nto deviations from a power-law behavior. Whether the result of Zehavi et al. (2004), who found departures from\na power law behavior in the galaxy correlation function\nof some samples of the SDSS catalog can be interpreted\nin this way, i.e. as dominated by nearest-neighbor correlations, is an open question, as they did not mention what\nis the average distance between nearest neighbors in their\nsample, and then they performed the analysis in real space\ninstead of redshift space as we do here.\nFor the conditional average density we find that it\nis characterized fairly well by a power-law behavior in\n\nthe range between 0.5 and 40 Mpc/h, where the exponent is \u03b3 = 0.8 \u00b1 0.2. This result is very robust at small\nscales (r <20 Mpc/h), as the volume average can be\nproperly performed, and it becomes progressively weaker\nwhen the limits of the sample (set by the radius rsm\nof the largest sphere fully contained in it) are reached.\nSystematic noise, due to un-averaged large fluctuations,\nincreases when r \u2192 rsm : one way to overcome this problem is to consider larger samples. In this respect it is useful\nto compare our results with the ones derived by Hogg et\nal. (2005) by analyzing the largest sample ever studied for\nthis correlation analysis. In fact they considered a sample of luminous red galaxies, covering a volume of about\n\u223c 0.6 (Gpc/h)3 . They found the same power-law as we\nfind here up to 20/30 Mpc/h. They then detected a slow\ncrossover toward homogeneity which is eventually reached\nat 70 Mpc/h. With the data we have considered here, due\nto the limited solid angle of the survey, we are not able to\nconfirm or disprove this result. In this respect it is worth\nnoticing that, for example, Sylos Labini et al. (1998) found\na similar value for the redshift space correlation exponent\nfor the conditional density at those scales: extending the\nanalysis to larger scales, with statistical tests of weaker\nrobustness, they however found evidences for a continuation of correlations with almost the same exponent up\nto scales of order of one hundred Mpc/h. Apparently the\nresults by Hogg et al. (2005) do not confirm such findings.\nLeaving the question of the extension of the power-law\nbehavior to further studies, we focus now on the interpretation of small-scale correlations. Up to the scale of few\ntens Mpc/h, the conditional density \u0393(r) show a powerlaw behavior, with exponent \u03b3 = 0.8\u00b10.2 and well defined\namplitude, although with some fluctuations in different\nsky regions. As discussed, the amplitude of the conditional\ndensity varies in different VL samples according to the luminosity of the galaxies selected. This has a very simple\nexplanation, that brighter galaxies are less frequent than\nfainter ones. One can develop an analytical formalism by\nconsidering the effect of the galaxy luminosity function to\nunderstand this change: in the hypothesis that space and\nluminosity are not correlated, usually adopted in studies\nof large scale galaxy distribution, one can quantitatively\ncompute the amplitude of the conditional density in different samples.\nWe have discussed that the results we get for the reduced two-point correlation function, although in agreement with the ones obtained by other groups, are affected\nby finite size effects. The reason is simply that as long as\nthe distribution presents strong fluctuations, the study of\n\u03be(r) is problematic. The regime of strong fluctuations is\ndescribed by a certain functional behavior of the conditional density \u0393(r), in the present case a power-law function. In this situation the estimation of the sample density\nis not only affected by large (statistical) noise, but it becomes sample size dependent, i.e. by a systematic effect.\nHowever because of the intrinsic large fluctuations systematic and statistical noise are entangled into the information provided by the amplitude of \u03be(r). Thus explicit tests\n\n\fVasilyev et al.: Large scale correlations from the 2dFGRS\n\nfor systematic finite size effects are needed, and these are\nprovided by the analysis of the conditional density.\nReferences\nBaryshev, Yu., Teerikorpi P., 2005, Bull.
