The 'gap survival\nprobability' due to overlap with particles produced in the underlying event has been estimated 3\nto be about 20% at the Tevatron.

For this study, the Jetset Parton Shower program\n_\nq\n\nq\n\nColour Octet\n\n_\nq\n\nq\n\nColour Singlet\n\nFigure 2: Colour flow in Coe (left) and Cse (right) shown by dotted lines.\n5\n\nhas been used to model Coe. Two simple models have been used to simulate the expected\ncolour flow in Cse: events of type qq\u0304\u03b3 with a photon effective mass as in the gluon jet mass\ndistribution are generated, and the photon is then replaced by a boosted quark dijet (model\nCS0), or by a gluon fragmenting independently (model CS2). The Rathsman 6 model, tuned 7\nto L3 hadronic Z decay data b , is also studied.\n2\n\nMethodology\n\nJet 2\nJet 2\n\nN 12\nN\n\n\u03c61\n\n\u03c62\n\nJet 1\n\n23\n\nJet 1\n\nN\nJet 3\n\n31\n\nJet 3\n\nFigure 3: Definitions of numbers of particles in inter-cone gaps (left) and angles relative to gap bisector (right).\n\nThree jet events are selected at jet resolution parameter, 0.05, using the Jade algorithm 8 ,\nwith inter-jet angles within \u00b130\u25e6 from the symmetric Mercedes topology. Particle momenta\nare projected on to the event plane defined by the two most energetic jets, and then all the\nangles (measured from most energetic jet) are rescaled so as to align jets at 0\u25e6 -120\u25e6 -240\u25e6 for\nuniformity in event-to-event comparison. To quantify the inter-jet gap angle, two definitions\nare used: the minimum opening angle of the particles measured from the bisector in each\nb\n\nA preliminary tuning has been performed for three different values of the colour recombination parameter:\nR0 = 0.037, 0.1, 0.2. The default value of 0.1 was obtained by fitting the model to H1 data on the diffractive\nproton structure function 6 .\n\n\fij\ngap, Bij = min(\u03c6ij\n1 , \u03c62 ), (B-angle, figure 3), and maximum separation angle between adjacent\nparticles in each gap, Sij , (S-angle). To minimise fragmentation bias, cones of half angle 15\u25e6\naround the jet-axis are removed in the definition of the gaps. Assigning jets 1, 2 to primary\nquarks, and introducing the generic variable for the gap between jets i, j as \u03b8ij (i, j = 1, 3),\nwhere \u03b8ij may be the number of particles in the gap, Nij , Bij (see figure 3) or Sij , the gap\nasymmetries are defined as: A12 = (\u2212\u03b812 + \u03b823 + \u03b831 )/(\u03b812 + \u03b823 + \u03b831 ), and cyclically for the\nother gaps. Reduced colour flow and thereby larger separation for Cse in gaps 23, 31 (together\nreferred to as qg) with respect to gap 12, should thus make A12 peak more strongly at positive\nvalues for Cse than for Coe. The angular asymmetries, in particular that using the bisector\nangle, are found to be more sensitive in separating Cse and Coe contributions than those using\nNij .\n\nL3 Data\nJetset\nCS0\nCS2\nRathsman\n\n1.2\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\nL3 Data\nJetset\nCS0\nCS2\nRathsman\n\n1.4\n\n1.2\n\n1\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.6\n\n0.4\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0\n-1\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\nA\n\n0\n\nB\n\n0.2\n\n12\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n-1\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\nA\n\n0\n\nB\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nqg\n\nFigure 4: Minimum bisector angle gap asymmetries for gaps 12 and qg.\n\n3\n\nResults\n\nThe analysis is performed with 2 million hadronic Z decay events recorded by the L3 detector\nduring 1994-95. In order to distinguish quark jets from gluon or colour singlet jets, quark jets\nare tagged by demanding that the b-tag discriminants c of jets 1 and 2 are above a certain cut-off\n(B1 = 1.25) and that of jet 3 is below a second cut-off (B2 = 1.5). This optimised selection\ntags 2668 events with a gluon purity of 78%. The asymmetries are calculated using calorimetric\nclusters with at least 100 MeV in the electromagnetic calorimeter and either at least two crystals\nhit or at least 900 MeV in the hadron calorimeter, or, no energy deposit in the electromagnetic\ncalorimeter, and more the 1800 MeV in the hadron calorimeter. As a cross-check, the analysis\nwas repeated using only charged tracks with pt > 100 MeV. The Bij asymmetry distributions,\ncorrected for detector effects as well as flavour composition, are compared to different models, all\nnormalized to unit area, in figure 4. The bin-by-bin correction factor typically lies in the range\nof \u00b120%. The fractional bin-by-bin systematic errors were estimated by using the Durham (k\u22a5 )\nc\n\nPn\ni\n\nPn\u22121\n\nj\nThe jet b-tag discriminant is defined as: Bjet = \u2212 log 10 P where P = Pn\n(\u2212 ln Pn\ni\ni ) /j! and\nj=0\nQn\n=\nP . Here, Pi is the probability that the ith particle in the jet originates at the primary vertex.\ni=0 i\n\n\falgorithm 9 with ycut = 0.01, 0.02 instead of the JADE one, giving \u223c 4-7%, and by changing the\nb-tag cuts so that the gluon purity varies by \u00b110% resulting in an error of \u223c 3-8 %. These errors\nare added in quadature. Changing the jet cone angle from 15\u25e6 to 20\u25e6 is found to have no effect\non the angular asymmetries. The data are consistent with Coe as modelled by Jetset. The\nprobability for having a \u03c72 greater than the observed value between data and the Rathsman\nmodel with the default colour reconnection parameter value R0 = 0.1 is O(10\u22126 ). Fits to data\nwith admixture of a fraction of Cse to Coe are consistent with zero admixture. Making a\ncombined fit to the asymmeties between gaps 12 and qg, the upper limit of the fraction of Cse\npresent in data, obtained with the CS0 or CS2 models, is estimated to be between 7% and\n9% at 95% confidence level. A similar fit for the parameter R0 of the Rathsman model, using\nthe Bij asymmetries, yields a 95% confidence level upper limit on the former of 0.0093. This\nimplies a very small mass shift for the W due to colour reconnection effects, in this model, of a\nfew MeV. For the default value, R0 = 0.1, the mass shift for decay of W-pairs into four jets is\nabout 65 MeV 6 . It is clearly then of interest to perform a similar analysis using other colour\nreconnection models (for example Ariadne 10 ) applicable both to Z and W-pair decays. Since\nthe fraction of colour singlet exchange expected, on the basis of the Tevatron measurements,\nis only 5-10%, after allowing for the effect of gap survival probability, the present analysis is\nnot sufficiently sensitive to confirm or exclude a similar effect in hadronic Z-decays. A LEP\ncombination, and/or an analysis with higher statistics using asymmetric 3-jet events is then\ndesirable.\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank Sunanda Banerjee, Swagato Banerjee and Dominique Duchesneau for\ntheir contributions to the work described here.
