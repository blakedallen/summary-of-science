Thus the mass generation in the Schwinger model can\nbe described in topological terms. Moreover, the same topological structures [2], when elevated\nto 4-dimensional space-time, provide a partial, 4-dimensional generalization of the Schwinger\nmodel, together with its mechanism for generating a mass. In Section II, we review the 2dimensional model and emphasize the central role in the mass generation scenario of the chiral\nanomaly, which is famously related to a topological term. This suggests employing topological\nentities when describing the model's dynamics. Such a topological formulation is given in\nSection III, which is then promoted to four dimensions in Section IV. A commentary on our\nresults comprises the last Section V.\n\n2\n\nSchwinger Model Resum\u00e9\n\nIn the Schwinger model, an Abelian vector potential A\u03bc interacts with a vector current J \u03bc\nconstructed from massless Dirac fields \u03c8. The Lagrange density reads\n1\nL = \u2212 F \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd + i\u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u03bc (\u2202\u03bc + ieA\u03bc )\u03c8,\n4\nLI = \u2212eJ \u03bc A\u03bc ,\n\nF\u03bc\u03bd \u2261 \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc ,\n\nJ \u03bc = \u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8.\n\n(2.1)\n\n(2.2)\n\nThe traditional solution of the model proceeds by functionally integrating the Dirac fields,\ngiving an effective action.\nZ\n1\nIef f (A) = \u2212\nF \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 i ln det[\u03b3 \u03bc (\u2202\u03bc + ieA\u03bc )]\n(2.3)\n4\nThe functional determinant can be computed because the only non vanishing Feynman diagram\nis the vacuum polarization graph.\n\nFigure 1: Vacuum polarization graph generates the polarization operator \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd (p) \u221d (g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 p\u03bc p\u03bd /p2 ).\n\nThis generates the polarization operator \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd (p) \u221d (g \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 p\u03bc p\u03bd /p2 ). The coefficient of g \u03bc\u03bd\n1\n\n\fis evaluation dependent (the diagram is superficially divergent), but it becomes fixed by the\ngauge invariance requirement that the vector current correlator (whose proper part is \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd ) be\ntransverse. The effective action\n\u0015\nZ \u0014\ne2\n\u2202\u03bc\u2202\u03bd\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\nA\u03bc (g \u2212\n)A\u03bd ,\n(2.4)\nIef f (A) =\n\u2212 F F\u03bc\u03bd +\n4\n2\u03c0\n\u22022\n2\n\nexhibits the generated mass, m2 = e\u03c0 . Although usually one says that the photon acquires a\nmass, in two dimensions the photon field A\u03bc can be decomposed as A\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u03b8 + \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u03bd \u03b7 \u2032 . The\ngauge part decouples; only the pseudoscalar \u03b7 \u2032 remains. So one could just as well say that a\npseudoscalar excitation acquires the mass.\nIt is important to appreciate that the axial vector current J\u03b15 , which is conserved with massless fermions within classical dynamics, acquires an anomalous divergence upon quantization.\nThis is immediately seen when the 2-dimensional duality relation between axial and vector\ncurrents is used.\nJ\u03b15 = \u01eb\u03b1\u03bc J \u03bc\n(2.5)\nFormula (2.5) is a consequence of 2-dimensional geometry: when J \u03bc is a vector, J\u03b15 defined by\n(2.5) is an axial vector. More explicitly, (2.5) is seen in a 2-dimensional gamma matrix identity.\n\u03b3\u03b1 \u03b3 5 = \u01eb\u03b1\u03bc \u03b3 \u03bc\n\n(2.6)\n\n\u03bd\n\nTherefore, the correlator 5 \u03a0\u03b1 of J\u03b15 with J \u03bd can be simply obtained from \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd as 5 \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd =\n\u01eb\u03b1\u03bc \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd . Moreover, once a transverse form for \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd is fixed by gauge invariance, 5 \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd fails to be\ntransverse in the \u03b1 index; the divergence of the axial vector current is anomalous.\n\u2202 \u03b1 J\u03b15 = \u2212\n\ne\ne \u03bc\u03bd\n\u01eb F\u03bc\u03bd = F\n2\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\n(2.7)\n\nIn the second equality we have introduced the (pseudo) scalar F , dual in two dimensions to the\nanti symmetric F\u03bc\u03bd \u2261 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd F\nThe anomaly provides an immediate derivation of the mass [3]. We begin with the gauge\nfield equation of motion that follows from (2.1).\n\u2202\u03bc F \u03bc\u03bd = eJ \u03bd\n\n(2.8)\n\nIn terms of the dual field strength this reads\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc F = eJ \u03bd .\n\n(2.9)\n\nThe \u01eb symbol may be transferred to the right side and J \u03bd becomes replaced by its dual J\u03b15 .\n\u2202\u03b1 F = \u2212 eJ\u03b15\n2\n\n(2.10)\n\n\fA further divergence gives the d'Alembertian on the left and the anomaly (2.7) on the right.\n\u22022F +\n\ne2\nF = 0\n\u03c0\n\n(2.11)\n\nThis demonstrates that the pseudoscalar F acquires a mass, m2 =\n\n3\n\ne2\n.\n\u03c0\n\nTopological Entities in the Schwinger Model\n\nThe 2-dimensional anomaly is proportional to \u2212F =\n2-dimensional Chern-Pontryagin density P2 .\nP2 =\n\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\n\u01eb F\u03bc\u03bd ,\n2\n\nwhich is recognized as the\n\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\n\u01eb F\u03bc\u03bd .\n2\n\n(3.1)\n\nFurthermore, the gauge potential A\u03bc is dual to the Chern-Simons current C2\u03b1 ,\nC2\u03b1 \u2261 \u01eb\u03b1\u03bc A\u03bc ,\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhose divergence forms the Chern-Pontryagin density [2].\n\u2202\u03b1 C2\u03b1 = \u01eb\u03b1\u03bc \u2202\u03b1 A\u03bc =\n\n1 \u03b1\u03bc\n\u01eb F\u03b1\u03bc = P2\n2\n\n(3.3)\n\nThe bosonic portion of the Lagrange density for the Schwinger model may be written in\nterms of these topological entities.\n\nL2\n\n1\n1\n= \u2212 F \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 e J \u03bc A\u03bc = F 2 \u2212 eA\u03bc \u01eb\u03bc\u03b1 J\u03b15\n4\n2\n1 2\nP + e C2\u03b1 J\u03b15\n=\n2 2\n\n(3.4)\n\nMoreover, since C2\u03b1 and A\u03bc are linearly related, it makes no difference which one is the fundamental variable. Thus varying C2\u03b1 in (3.4) gives (2.10) directly as the equation of motion.\n\u2212\u2202\u03b1 P2 + e J\u03b15 = 0\n\n(3.5)\n\nA further divergence and the anomaly equation (2.7) reproduce (2.11), since P2 = \u2212 F .\nIt is this last, topological reformulation of the Schwinger model that we shall take to four dimensions. However, we must still address an important point that will arise in the 4-dimensional\ntheory. Observe that the equation of motion (2.10) or (3.5) entails an integrability condition:\nSince the (axial) vector J\u03b15 is set equal to a gradient of (the pseudoscalar) P2 , it must be\nthat the curl of the axial vector vanishes. Equivalently, the dual of the axial vector must be\n3\n\n\fdivergence-free; viz. the vector current must be conserved. Of course the same integrability\ncondition is seen in the original vector formulation of the model, with equation of motion (2.8),\nwhich entails conservation of the vector current (dual to the axial vector current).\nBut let us suppose that we have dynamical information only about the topological variables,\nand do not know whether the current dual to the axial vector current is conserved. (This is\nthe situation that we shall meet in four dimensions.) Then we must reformulate our theory in\nsuch a way that the integrability condition is avoided.\nThis reformulation in two dimensions proceeds by introducing two St\u00fcckelberg fields p and\nq into L2 .\n1\n(3.6)\nL\u20322 = P22 + e(C2\u03b1 + \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 \u2202\u03b2 p)(J\u03b15 + \u01eb\u03b1\u03b3 \u2202 \u03b3 q)\n2\nUpon varying C2\u03b1 , (3.5) becomes replaced by\n\u2212\u2202\u03b1 P2 + e (J\u03b15 + \u01eb\u03b1\u03b3 \u2202 \u03b3 q) = 0.\n\n(3.7)\n\nAdditionally, variation of p and q give, respectively\n\u2202\u03b1 \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 J\u03b25 + \u2202 2 q = 0,\n\n(3.8)\n\n\u2202 \u03b1 \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 C2\u03b2 + \u2202 2 p = 0.\n\n(3.9)\n\nThe integrability condition on (3.7) demands that the curl of J\u03b15 + \u01eb\u03b1\u03b3 \u2202 \u03b3 q vanish but this\nis secured by (3.8). This equation determines a non-trivial value for q if the curl of J\u03b15 is nonvanishing, while (3.9) fixes an innocuous value for p. Finally we observe that the divergence of\n(3.7) annihilates the q - dependent term, leaving in the end the previous equation (2.11).\nWe may understand the role of the St\u00fcckelberg fields by reverting to the original vector\nvariables. Then the interaction part of L\u20322 in (3.6) reads\nL\u20322I = \u2212e(J \u03bc + \u2202 \u03bc q)(A\u03bc + \u2202\u03bc p),\n\n(3.10)\n\nand (3.8), (3.9) have respective counterparts in\n\u2202\u03bc J \u03bc + \u2202 2 q = 0,\n\n(3.11)\n\n\u2202 \u03bc A\u03bc + \u2202 2 p = 0.\n\n(3.12)\n\nEliminating p and q from (3.10) with the help of (3.11), (3.12) leaves\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\u03bc \u2202 \u03bd\n\u03bd\n\u2032\n\u03bc\nA\u03bd .\n\u03b4\u03bc \u2212\nL2I = \u2212eJ\n\u22022\n4\n\n(3.13)\n\n\fThis shows that the St\u00fcckelberg fields ensure that the interaction occurs only between\ntransverse components of J \u03bc and A\u03bc . For yet another perspective on the role of the St\u00fcckelberg\nR\nfields, note that \u2212e J \u03bc A\u03bc is not gauge invariant ( A\u03bc \u2192 A\u03bc + \u2202\u03bc \u03b8) when J \u03bc is not conserved.\nHowever, the combination A\u03bc + \u2202\u03bc p is always gauge invariant because p can transform as p - \u03b8.\nFinally observe that eliminating the St\u00fcckelberg fields in (3.5) with the help of (3.8) and the\nanomaly equation (2.7) leaves\n\u0013\n\u0012\ne2 /\u03c0\nP2 = 0\n(3.14)\n\u2202\u03bc P2 +\n\u22022\nThis is equivalent to (3.5), but carries no integrability condition. Thus we see that the\nSt\u00fcckelberg modification overcomes difficulties, which arise when the current dual to the axial\nvector is not conserved.\n\n4\n\n4-Dimensional Model with Topological Mass Generation\n\nFor a 4-dimensional generalization of the previous, we adopt the formulation of the 2-dimensional\nmodel, presented in Section III in terms of the Chern-Pontryagin density and Chern-Simons\ncurrent, now promoted to four dimensions, P4 and C4\u03b1 respectively, with the latter coupling to\nan axial vector current J\u03b15 whose divergence is anomalous. The topological entities are constructed from gauge potentials, which we take to be Abelian or non-Abelian; in either case P4\nand C4\u03b1 remain gauge singlets.\nP4 \u2261\na\nF\u03bc\u03bd\n\n1 \u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd a a\na\n\u01eb\nF\u03b1\u03b2 F\u03bc\u03bd = \u2217 F \u03bc\u03bd a F\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n\n\u2261 \u2202\u03bc Aa\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd Aa\u03bc + f abc Ab\u03bc Ac\u03bd ,\nC4\u03b1 \u2261 2\u01eb\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd\u03c9 (Aa\u03bc \u2202\u03bd Aa\u03c9 +\n\n(4.1)\n\u2217\n\n1\nF \u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n\n1 abc a b c\nf A\u03bc A\u03bd A\u03c9 )\n3\n\n\u2202\u03b1 C4\u03b1 = P4\n\n(4.2)\n(4.3)\n\nHere f abc are the structure constants of the appropriate Lie algebra.\nUnlike in the 2-dimansional case, the Chern-Simons current is not linear in the gauge vector\npotential; nevertheless we remain with the potential as the fundamental dynamical variable,\nand the variation of the Chern-Simons current reads\n\u03b4C4\u03b1 = 4\u2217 F \u03b1\u03bc a \u03b4Aa\u03bc \u2212 2\u01eb\u03b1\u03bd\u03c9\u03bc \u2202\u03bd (Aa\u03c9 \u03b4Aa\u03bc ).\n\n5\n\n(4.4)\n\n\fA further difference from the Schwinger model is that there is no reason to suppose that the\ndual to the 4-dimensional axial vector current is conserved. On the level of 4-dimensional\ngamma matrices, the duality relation is\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c9\u03b1 \u03b3\u03b1 \u03b3 5 = g \u03bc\u03bd \u03b3 \u03c9 \u2212 g \u03bc\u03c9 \u03b3 \u03bd + g \u03bd\u03c9 \u03b3 \u03bc \u2212 \u03b3 \u03bc \u03b3 \u03bd \u03b3 \u03c9 .\n\n(4.5)\n\nIt is improbable that fermion dynamics (here unspecified) would leave conserved the current\ndual to the axial vector current. But this is not an obstacle to our construction, because we\ncan employ the St\u00fcckelberg formalism, as explained in the previous Section, to overcome the\ndifficulty.\nThus the Lagrange density that we adopt is\nL\u20324 =\n\n1 2\nP + \u039b2 (C4\u03b1 + \u2202\u03b2 p\u03b1\u03b2 )(J\u03b15 + \u2202 \u03b3 q\u03b1\u03b3 ).\n2 4\n\n(4.6)\n\nThe St\u00fcckelberg fields p\u03b1\u03b2 and q\u03b1\u03b3 are anti symmetric in their indices; \u039b2 carries mass-squared\ndimension; the axial vector current possesses an anomalous divergence.\na\n\u2202 \u03b1 J\u03b15 = \u2212N \u2217 F \u03bc\u03bd a F\u03bc\u03bd\n= \u2212NP4\n\n(4.7)\n\nN is a numerical coupling constant, taken positive.\nVariation of the L\u20324 action with respect to Aa\u03bc gives , with the help of (4.4),\nZ\n\u0001\n\u2212\u2202\u03b1 P4 + \u039b2 (J\u03b15 + \u2202 \u03b3 q\u03b1\u03b3 ) \u03b4C4\u03b1 =\nZ\n\n\u0002\n\u0001\n4 \u2212\u2202\u03b1 P4 + \u039b2 (J\u03b15 + \u2202 \u03b3 q\u03b1\u03b3 ) \u2217 F \u03b1\u03bc\n\na\n\n\u2212 2\u01eb\u03b1\u03bd\u03c9\u03bc Aa\u03bd \u2202\u03c9 \u2212\u2202\u03b1 P4 + \u039b2 (J\u03b15 + \u2202 \u03b3 q\u03b1\u03b3 )\n\nso that the equation of motion demands\n2 \u2212\u2202\u03b1 P4 + \u039b2 (J\u03b15 + \u2202 \u03b3 q\u03b1\u03b3 )\n\n\u0001\n\n\u2217\n\nF \u03b1\u03bc\n\na\n\n\u2212 \u01eb\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd\u03c9 Aa\u03bd \u2202\u03c9 \u039b2 (J\u03b15 + \u2202 \u03b3 q\u03b1\u03b3 ) = 0.\n\n(4.8)\n\n\u0001\u0003\n\n\u03b4Aa\u03bc ,\n\n(4.9)\n\nVariation of the two St\u00fcckelberg fields yields the equations\n\u2202\u03b1 (J\u03b25 + \u2202 \u03b3 q\u03b2\u03b3 ) \u2212 \u03b1 \u2190\u2192 \u03b2 = 0,\n\n(4.10)\n\n\u2202 \u03b1 (C4\u03b2 + \u2202\u03b3 p\u03b2\u03b3 ) \u2212 \u03b1 \u2190\u2192 \u03b2 = 0.\n\n(4.11)\n\nThe first of these allows setting to zero the second member of (4.9), while in the first member\nof that equation we may strip away \u2217 F \u03b1\u03bc a with the help of the identity\n\u2217\n\n1\nF \u03b1\u03bc F\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212 \u03b4\u03bd\u03b1 P4 .\n4\n6\n\n(4.12)\n\n\fConsequently (provided P4 6= 0) we are left with\n\u2212\u2202\u03b1 P4 + \u039b2 (J\u03b15 + \u2202 \u03b3 q\u03b1\u03b3 ) = 0.\n\n(4.13)\n\nThe integrability condition on this equation is satisfied by virtue of (4.10). Taking another\ndivergence of (4.13) annihilates the St\u00fcckelberg field because of its anti symmetry, while (4.7)\nprovides the divergence for J\u03b15 .

To these we now call attention.\nThe principal defect is the absence of dynamics that should produce the anomaly for the axial\nvector current. In the Schwinger model, the same dynamics and the same degrees of freedom\nthat generate the mass are also responsible for the anomaly (2.7). In the 4-dimensional theory\nwe must posit the anomaly (4.7) separately from the mass generating dynamics. Moreover, our\nfinal result is that P4 propagates as a free massive field. Additional dynamics must be specified\nto describe interactions.\nA related question concerns the role in physical theory for our Lagrangian (4.6). Since it\ninvolves dimension eight ( P4 ) and dimension six ( C4\u03b1 J\u03b15 ) operators, it should be viewed as an\neffective Lagrangian. In this connection, observe that the Born-Infeld action and the radiatively\ninduced Euler-Heisenberg action both contain the Abelian (\u2217 F \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd )2 quantity in a weak-field\nexpansion [also accompanied by an (F \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd )2 term].\nThe kinetic portion of the Lagrangian in the Weyl (A0 = 0 ) gauge involves \u0226i \u0226j B i B j where\nB i is the magnetic field. Canonical analysis and quantization with such a kinetic term faces\n7\n\n\fdifficulties because the metric on Ai space, viz. B i B j , is singular. But this poses no problem\nif our Lagrangian is used for phenomenological purposes, with the semi-classical addition of\nquantum effects through the chiral anomaly.\nThe U(1) character of our anomalous current and the presence in our theory of the ChernPontryagin quantity suggest that here we are dealing with the problems of the unwanted axial\nU(1) symmetry and the mass of the \u03b7 \u2032 meson. Conventionally these issues are resolved by\ninstantons [4]. Here we offer a phenomenological description. We relate the axial vector current\nto the \u03b7 \u2032 field,\nJ\u03b15 = Z\u2202\u03b1 \u03b7 \u2032 /\u039b\n(5.1)\n(Z is a normalization) and add an \u03b7 \u2032 kinetic term to (4.6).\nL\u03b7 \u2032 =\n\n1\n1 2\nP4 + Z\u039bC4\u03b1 \u2202\u03b1 \u03b7 \u2032 + \u2202\u03b1 \u03b7 \u2032 \u2202 \u03b1 \u03b7 \u2032\n2\n2\n\n(5.2)\n\n[We dispense with the St\u00fcckelberg fields because the dual of the current in (5.1) is conserved.]\nObserve that the \u03b7 \u2032 field enjoys a constant shift symmetry, as befits the quadratic portion of a\nGoldstone field Lagrangian. The equations that follow from varying Aa\u03bc and \u03b7 \u2032 respectively, are\n\u2202\u03b1 (P4 \u2212 Z\u039b\u03b7 \u2032 ) \u2217 F \u03b1\u03bc\n\na\n\n= 0\n\n(5.3)\n\n\u2202 2 \u03b7 \u2032 + Z\u039bP4 = 0\n\n(5.4)\n\n\u2202 2 P4 + Z 2 \u039b2 P4 = 0.\n\n(5.5)\n\nTogether the two imply\nAs before, a mass is generated.\nThis may also be seen by rewriting the Lagrangian in (5.2), apart from a total derivative,\nas\nL\u03b7 \u2032\n\n1 2\nP \u2212 Z\u039bP4 \u03b7 \u2032 +\n2 4\n1\n=\n(P4 \u2212 Z\u039b\u03b7 \u2032)2 +\n2\n=\n\n1\n\u2202\u03b1 \u03b7 \u2032 \u2202 \u03b1 \u03b7 \u2032\n2\n1\n1\n\u2202\u03b1 \u03b7 \u2032 \u2202 \u03b1 \u03b7 \u2032 \u2212 Z 2 \u039b2 \u03b7 \u20322 .\n2\n2\n\n(5.6)\n\nWith Z\u039b\u03b7 \u2032 absorbed by P4 , we see that \u03b7 \u2032 decouples, but carries a mass.\nIn the case of 4-dimensional QCD with massless quark flavor(s), equation (5.5) can be\nobtained without any assumptions about the dependence of the effective Lagrangian on the \u03b7 \u2032\nmeson. We only need to assume that the effective Lagrangian contains the first P42 term in\n(5.6). The analog of the second term is automatically generated from the anomaly diagram\n(Fig. 2) that correlates C4\u03b1 and J\u03b15 .\n8\n\n\fFigure 2: Anomaly diagram that correlates C4\u03b1 and J\u03b25\n\nThe diagram generates the following operator\n\u039b2 C4\u03b1\n\n\u2202\u03b1 \u2202 \u03b2 5\nJ ,\n\u22022 \u03b2\n\n(5.7)\n\nwhere \u039b2 arises as a momentum cut off. This expression is also what one obtains from (4.6) after\neliminating the St\u00fcckelberg fields p\u03b1\u03b2 and q\u03b1\u03b3 through their equations of motion (4.10), (4.11).\nThus massless quark dynamics due to the anomaly substitute the effect of the St\u00fcckelberg\nfields. Variation with respect to Aa\u03bc yields the analog of equation (4.13).\n\u2202\u03b1 \u03b2 5\n\u2202 J\u03b2 = 0\n(5.8)\n\u22022\nUsing the anomalous divergence relation (4.7), we arrive to the equation (4.16), which is equivalent to (5.5). Because P4 acquires a mass, its expectation value in the QCD vacuum must\nvanish. This explains why QCD solves both U(1) and the strong CP problems in the zero quark\nmass limit [5].\nSimilar effects should be present in all even dimensions, but the singularity structure and\nthe required dimensional parameter (analog of the 2- and 4-dimensional e and \u039b) will change.\nIn conclusion we observe that although both the 2- and 4-dimensional models are formulated\nin terms of topological entities (P, C \u03b1 ), they are not topological theories. Examining (3.6), (4.6)\nwe see that the Chern-Simons/axial vector interaction term (C \u03b1 J\u03b15 ) is a geometric scalar density\nand can be integrated over a manifold in a diffeomrphism invariant way, without introducing a\nmetric tensor. However, for the kinetic term (P 2 ) to be a scalar density it must be divided by\n\u221a\ng. (In this discussion we ignore the St\u00fcckelberg terms.) Without this metric factor the theory\nis not invariant against all diffeomorphisms, but only against the volume preserving ones with\nunit Jacobian.\n\u2212\u2202\u03b1 P4 + \u039b2\n\n6\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank G.
