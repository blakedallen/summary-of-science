In this context, a cluster's\nintrinsic PMDF is broadened by the error distribution function (eDF) that, given the\naverage error amplitude, has a width usually comparable to the cluster PMDF.

Alternatively, it may\noriginate from cluster merger, large-scale mass segregation or, least probably, binaries.\nKey words: (Galaxy:) open clusters and associations: general\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nStar clusters continually undergo mass segregation and\nevaporation, tidal interactions with Galactic substructures,\nshocks with giant molecular clouds, as well as mass loss due\nto stellar evolution. By decreasing the total cluster mass\n- and the collective gravitational potential, these processes\naffect the internal dynamics and accelerate the cluster dynamical evolution. Thus, the escape velocity (vesc ) and, to a\nlesser degree, the space velocity dispersion (\u03c3v ), are expected\nto continually change with time. As a consequence, the majority of the open clusters (OCs) dissolve in the Galactic\nstellar field long before reaching an age of \u223c 1 Gyr (e.g.\nLamers et al. 2005; Goodwin & Bastian 2006). In this context, the dynamical evolution of a star cluster depends critically on the balance between \u03c3v and vesc .\nFor a cluster that is approximately in virial equilibrium, the space velocity dispersion can be computed as\n\u03c3v (km s\u22121 ) =\n\nq\n\nG MD\n\u03b7 Ref f\n\n\u2248 0.7\n\n\u0010\n\nMD\n103 M\u2299\n\n\u00111/2 \u0010\n\nRef f\n1 pc\n\n\u0011\u22121/2\n\n(Spitzer 1987), where G is the gravitational constant, MD\nis the dynamical mass (assumed to be stored only in single stars), \u03b7 \u2248 9.75 is a constant, and Ref f is the effective,\nor projected half-light radius. As a scaling factor, bound\nclusters with MD \u223c 103 M\u2299 and Ref f \u223c 1 pc are expected\n\nto have \u03c3v \u223c 1 km s\u22121 . Since the majority of the Galactic\nOCs have masses lower than 103 M\u2299 (e.g. Piskunov et al.\n2007), velocity dispersions lower than, or of the order of\n\u03c3v \u223c 1 km s\u22121 should be a rule.\nObviously, the above expectation does not apply to clusters that are on their way to dissolution, either at the earliest\nevolutionary stages (less than a few 107 yr) or much later, at\nthe remnant phase (several 108 yr, e.g. Pavani & Bica 2007).\nSuch a super-virial state in very young clusters is related\nto the impulsive expulsion of the residual parental molecular cloud gas, driven primarily by the strong winds of massive stars and supernovae (Goodwin & Bastian 2006), thus\nleading to the high dissolution rate of young clusters (e.g.\nLada & Lada 2003). Examples of dissolving young OCs with\nvelocity dispersions that by far exceed the expected dynamical value (de Grijs et al. 2008) are NGC 2244, with an age of\n\u223c 5 Myr and \u03c3v \u223c 35 km s\u22121 (Chen, de Grijs & Zhao 2004;\nBonatto & Bica 2009b), Cr 197 and vdB 92, both with an\nage of \u223c 5 Myr and \u03c3v \u223c 20 km s\u22121 (Bonatto & Bica 2010a)\nA first-order estimate of a star cluster's \u03c3v can be\nobtained by measuring the proper-motion (PM) distribution of the member stars. Having obtained the PM components in right ascension (\u03bc\u03b1 cos(\u03b4)) and declination (\u03bc\u03b4 )\nof each member, the \u03c3\u03b1 \u2261 \u03c3\u03bc cos(\u03b4) and \u03c3\u03b4 \u2261 \u03c3\u03bc\u03b4 dis\u03b1\n\n\fC. Bonatto and E. Bica\n\n2\n\nPROPER MOTION ANALYSIS:\nHISTOGRAMS OR DISTRIBUTION\nFUNCTIONS?\n\nWhen dealing with PMs, the first step is to isolate the (most\nprobable) cluster members, subtract the systemic components of \u03bc\u03b1 cos(\u03b4) and \u03bc\u03b4 from each star, and then compute\nthe tangential or on-sky PM \u03bcos . The systemic components\ncan be directly computed from the data or obtained in OC\ndatabases (e.g. WEBDA1 or DAML022 ).\nUsually, the next step involves building PM histograms\nwith a given bin width to estimate the dispersion either of\nthe components or the on-sky. However, except for a few particular cases with high-quality astrometry3 , ground-based\nPMs usually have significant errors, in general larger than\nthe adopted histogram bins. Thus, by ignoring the error amplitude, histograms should be taken only as first-order representatives of a cluster's intrinsic PM distribution.

Alternatively, if the systemic PM components are known, one canpcompute directly the tangential or on-sky\n\u03bc\u03b1 cos(\u03b4)2 + \u03bc\u03b4 2 and disper\u221a PM \u03bcos =\nsion \u03c3os = \u03c3\u03b1 2 + \u03c3\u03b4 2 . Then, assuming isotropy, we can\ntake \u03c3v 2 = 32 (\u03c3\u03b1 2 + \u03c3\u03b4 2 ) = 23 \u03c3os 2 . At this point, it should\nbe mentioned that, contrary to radial velocity measurements, proper motions are essentially unaffected by binarity\n(Kouwenhoven & de Grijs 2008). This occurs because radial velocities are instantaneous measurements, while proper\nmotions involve a (usually large) timespan. In this sense,\nKouwenhoven & de Grijs (2008) show that for clusters of\nmass \u223c 1000 M\u2299 , binaries produce an observed radial velocity dispersion several times higher than the dynamical one,\nthus leading to an artificially-overestimated cluster mass.\nComprehensive databases such as the Third U.S.\nNaval Observatory CCD Astrograph Catalog (UCAC3,\nZacharias et al. 2010) and the The Naval Observatory\nMerged Astrometric Dataset (NOMAD, Zacharias et al.\n2005) provide PM components for huge amounts of stars,\neither isolated or in clusters. However, a drawback of such\nall-sky, ground-based PM databases is the fact that the 1\u03c3\nuncertainties in \u03bc\u03b1 cos(\u03b4) and \u03bc\u03b4 are usually large. The effect\nthat such errors have on the determination of \u03c3v , which usually involves building PM histograms with bin sizes smaller\nthan the average 1\u03c3 errors, is a constantly neglected point.\nInstead of histograms, our approach in this paper is to work\nwith PM distribution functions (PMDFs), in which the errors are formally taken into account.\nThis paper is organised as follows. In Sect. 2 we build\nPMDFs and compare them with the classical histograms.\nIn Sect. 3 we select some relatively nearby and populous\nOCs as test cases. In Sect. 4 we discuss the deconvolution\nmethod that we apply on the PMDFs. In Sect. 5 we present\nthe results obtained so far and discuss some observational\nlimitations. Concluding remarks are given in Sect. 6.\n\nN/bin (stars/mas yr )\n\n2\n\nHistogram\nPMDF\nPSF\n\n125\n\nAvg\nMin\n\n100\n75\n50\n25\n0\n\u221240\n\n\u221230\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221210\n0\n10\n\u22121\n\u03bc\u03b1cos(\u03b4) [mas yr ]\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\nFigure 1.

The amplitude of the maximum, average, and minimum\n1\u03c3 errors are illustrated (horizontal lines). Also shown is the error\ndistribution function (dashed line).\n\nbins would obviously minimise this effect, but would also\ndegrade the PM resolution. The net result would be artificially high values of the dispersion. This is illustrated in\nFig. 1 for the \u03bc\u03b1 cos(\u03b4) component of the OCs NGC 2682\nand NGC 2477 (Sect. 3), where we show the classical histogram built with bins of size \u2206\u03bc\u03b1 cos(\u03b4) = 1 mas yr\u22121 . Also\nshown are the average, minimum, and maximum values of\nthe 1\u03c3 errors. Clearly, in both cases the average 1\u03c3 error\ncorresponds to approximately the core (\u2248 4 bins) of the histogram. It should be noted as well the introduction of a sort\nof high-frequency noise, which originates from the Poisson\nfluctuation associated with the bin size.\nThus, instead of histograms, the correct way of dealing\nwith the above issue is by explicitly incorporating the PM\ncomponent errors in PMDFs, which are defined as the fractional number of stars per interval of PM, P M DF \u2261 \u03c6(\u03bc) =\ndN/d\u03bc, where \u03bc is any component among \u03bc\u03b1 cos(\u03b4), \u03bc\u03b4 , and\n\u03bcos . The errors are incorporated in the PMDFs by assuming\nthat they are normally (i.e. Gaussian) distributed. Accordingly, if measurements of a given parameter \u03c7 are normally\ndistributed around the average \u03c7\u0304 with a standard deviation\n\u01eb, the probability of finding it at a specific value \u03c7 is given\n1 \u03c7\u2212\u03c7\u0304 2\nby P (\u03c7) = \u221a 1 e\u2212 2 ( \u01eb ) .\n2\u03c0\u01eb\n\nWe start by defining a set of PM bins spanning the\nwhole range of values observed in \u03bc\u03b1 cos(\u03b4), \u03bc\u03b4 , and \u03bcos .\nThe bins have smaller widths around the PMDF peak than\nfor higher or lower velocities (for preserving profile resolu-\n\n\fDeconvolved OC-velocity dispersion\ntion - App. A). Then, for a star with PM components and\n1\u03c3 uncertainties \u03bc\u03b1 cos(\u03b4) \u00b1 \u01eb\u03bc cos(\u03b4) , \u03bc\u03b4 \u00b1 \u01eb\u03bc\u03b4 , \u03bcos \u00b1 \u01eb\u03bcos ,\n\u03b1\nwe compute the probability of the PM of that star to be\nin a given bin, which is simply the difference of the error\nfunctions computed at the bin borders. By doing this for all\nstars, we end up with the number-density of stars in each PM\nbin, the integral of which over the whole range of PM values is simply the number of stars. The \u03bc\u03b1 cos(\u03b4) PMDFs of\nNGC 2682 and NGC 2477 are shown in Fig. 1. By construction, the PMDFs are much smoother than the histograms\n(the high-frequency noise has been naturally removed) and,\nbecause of the broadening effect due to the error spreading\nprocedure, they are also somewhat wider and have a lower\namplitude. Both the histograms and PMDFs are definitely\nnon-Gaussian, especially because of the broad wings.\nNow, the same procedure is applied to the uncertainties, thus resulting in the intrinsic error distribution function (eDF). As anticipated by the amplitude of the average 1\u03c3 error, the eDF has a width comparable to that of\nthe PMDF for both NGC 2682 and NGC 2477. In this context, the eDF plays a r\u00f4le of a PM point-spread function\n(PSF), which tends to broaden the intrinsic cluster PMDF\non a degree that depends essentially on the PMDF and eDF\nwidths. Thus, our approach here is to deconvolve the observed PMDF of selected OCs (Sect. 3) using the intrinsic\neDF as PSF (Sect. 4).\n\n5\n7\n\nTEST CASES\n\nAs test cases we searched for OCs that are located relatively nearby (for allowing detection of low-PM components\n- Sect. 5), away from central directions and the disk (to minimise field-star contamination), and with a wide range of\nages. Additionally, the candidates should have a significant\nnumber of stars with available PM components in UCAC34\n(for more representative PMDFs). The sample of OCs meeting our criteria are NGC 1039 (M 34), NGC 2477, NGC 2516,\nNGC 2682 (M 67), and NGC 7762; their fundamental parameters are listed in Table 1. In short, the selected OCs have\nages within 0.2 - 4 Gyr and distances from the Sun within\n\u223c 0.4 \u2212 1.3 kpc.\n2MASS5 (Skrutskie et al. 2006) colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) extracted from the central region (R < 5\u2032 )\nare shown in Fig. 2. The 5\u2032 boundary was selected for practical reasons. Our analysis depends on the number of member\nstars in two different cluster regions (Sect. 4), and the stellar density profiles (Fig. 3) show that R = 5\u2032 represents a\ncompromise between adequate statistics and a change from\nRDPs following a pure power-law (R & 5\u2032 ) to a powerlaw flattened by a core (R . 5\u2032 ). For NGC 2682 (M 67) we\nalso use the ground-based CCD astrometry of Yadav et al.\n(2008) as an independent data set for cross-checking our results. The PM components provided by Yadav et al. (2008)\nare already corrected for the cluster's systemic velocity.

Extracted within R < 5\u2032 , the CMDs have been built\nwith 2MASS photometry, except for panel (b) that was built with\nthe VI CCD photometry of Yadav et al. (2008). Only stars that\noccur within the colour-magnitude filter (shaded polygon) are\nconsidered in the analyses.\n\n2MASS photometry was extracted from VizieR6 in a wide\ncircular field of radius Rext = 90\u2032 , which is adequate for\ndetermining the cluster extension and background level (see\nbelow). We also build a colour-magnitude filter for each cluster, which is used to isolate probable member stars (see, e.g.\nBonatto & Bica 2010b for a discussion on the use of such\nfilters). Only stars with colour and magnitude compatible\nwith the filter are used in the subsequent analyses. Age,\ndistance from the Sun, and reddening are derived by fitting solar-metallicity Padova isochrones (Girardi et al. 2002;\nBonatto, Bica & Girardi 2004) to the CMDs. The derived\nfundamental parameters (Table 1) are similar to those in\nWEBDA.\nAfter isolating the probable member stars with the\ncolour-magnitude filters, we use them to build the stellar\nradial density profile (RDP), which is the projected stellar\nnumber density profile around the cluster centre (Fig. 3).\nNote that the cluster centres have been computed by an algorithm that searches for the highest stellar density in the\ninnermost bin and, at the same time, the smoothest RDP\n(Bonatto & Bica 2010a). Working with colour-magnitude\nfiltered photometry minimises field contamination and enhances the RDP contrast with the fore/background.

The near-infrared RDPs show that the selected\nOCs have an extension reaching \u2248 20 \u2212 30\u2032 (the optical data\nof Yadav et al. 2008 are restricted to \u2248 15\u2032 ).

Bottom: field-subtracted (shaded area) and deconvolved (solid line) PMDFs.\n\nprobable members are still present in the central region, in\nvarying amounts for the different OCs. The residual field\ncontamination will be taken into account in the PM analysis (Sect. 4).\nProper motion components were obtained in UCAC3\n(that also provides the 2MASS photometry for each star)\nbased on the same central coordinates and extraction radius\n\n\fDeconvolved OC-velocity dispersion\nNGC2682 (UCAC3)\n\nas those used for building the CMDs and RDPs. Afterwards,\nwe applied the respective colour-magnitude filters (Fig. 2)\nbefore computing the PM distributions (see below).\n\nBy construction, the observed PMDFs are broadened by a\nPSF that corresponds to the eDF (Sect. 2). Thus, to uncover\nthe intrinsic PMDFs, we apply the iterative RichardsonLucy (RL) deconvolution method proposed by Richardson\n(1972) and Lucy (1974). The RL deconvolution conserves\nthe PMDF integral (in the present context the number of\nstars), but has a relatively slow convergence rate.\nWe illustrate the RL deconvolution with the \u03bc\u03b1 cos(\u03b4),\n\u03bc\u03b4 , and \u03bcos components of the OC NGC 2682 (Fig. 4). As the\nfirst step we define the PM-bin size distribution (App. A),\nand compute and subtract the systemic PM components\n(Table 1) from \u03bc\u03b1 cos(\u03b4) and \u03bc\u03b4 . Actually, this is an iterative step, in which we first subtract the field contamination, deconvolve the resulting PMDF and obtain the systemic PM. We use the region R < 20\u2032 in the analysis as a\ncompromise between the number of member stars and contrast with the field level (Fig. 3). Then we build the cluster\nand field PMDFs, together with the eDF, which has a width\nsimilar to that of the cluster PMDF. Next, the contaminant\nPMDF of the residual field stars, which is especially seen in\n\u03bc\u03b1 cos(\u03b4) as a bump centred at \u2248 6 mas yr\u22121 , is subtracted\nfrom the observed PMDFs. Finally, the RL deconvolution is\napplied to the field-subtracted PMDF.\nBesides the slow convergence rate, the RL deconvolution is also known for not having a universal convergence\ncriterion. Thus, for determining the number of deconvolution iterations (Nit ), we simply sum the squared difference\nbetween successive iterations over all bins of the deconvolved\nPMDF, defined as\n\u03c72j =\n\nX\ni\n\n194 stars\n\n628 stars\n\n333 stars\n\n865 stars\n\n44 stars\n\n\u03c6(\u03bcos) [0'\u22125']\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\n0\n1\n\n160 stars\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n1\n\n204 stars\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n0\n\n3\n\n6\n\n\u22121\n\n9\n\n\u03bcos (mas yr )\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nFigure 5.

After a\nseries of tests to check changes in deconvolution parameters with the number of iterations, we arbitrarily decided to\nstop whenNit = 200 (or f\u03c7 = 0.003 \u2212 0.005; App. A). Under\nthis criterion, the deconvolved PMDFs end up with significantly lower dispersions than the observed ones (Figs. 4 to\n6 and Table 2), without significant added noise or artifacts\n(App. A). Besides, contrary to the observed PMDFs, the\nshape of the deconvolved ones is approximately Gaussian.\n\n5\n\n237 stars\n\n0.2\n\n\u03c6(\u03bcos) [5'\u221220']\n\nPMDF DECONVOLUTION\n\n138 stars\n\nNGC1039\n\n0.8\n\n\u03c6(\u03bcos) [0'\u221220']\n\n4\n\n1\n\nNGC2682 (optical)\n\n5\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nSimilarly to NGC 2682 (Sect. 4), the RL deconvolution was\napplied to the field-subtracted PMDFs of the remaining\nOCs. Here we present the results of this procedure but, to\navoid redundancy, we restrict the discussion to the on-sky\nPMDFs. However, besides the overall cluster, we also analyse separately the central and outer regions (according to\nthe RDPs in Fig. 3), to search for spatial variations in the\n\nstellar kinematics that may be related to dynamical evolution. The deconvolved PMDFs are subsequently fitted with a\n2\nGaussian profile (P M DF (\u03bc) \u221d e\u22120.5((\u03bc\u2212\u03bc\u0304)/\u03c3) ), which provides the velocity dispersion (\u03c3) and the average velocity\n(\u03bc\u0304) of the stars in the region. The field-subtracted and deconvolved PMDFs are shown in Figs. 5 and 6, and the relevant profile parameters are given in Table 2. The observed,\nfield, and error PMDFs for the full OC sample are shown in\nApp. B.\nIt is clear that the deconvolved PMDFs (with dispersion\n\u03c3dec ) are significantly narrower than the field-subtracted\nones (\u03c3obs ). Indeed, we find \u03c3dec \u2248 (0.1 \u2212 0.25) \u03c3obs , but\nthis ratio should be taken as an upper limit, since the observed PMDFs are not Gaussian and the fit is dominated by\nthe profile core.\nThe central and outer parts of NGC 1039, NGC 2516,\nand NGC 7762, have PMDFs essentially characterised by a\nsingle Gaussian.

Conversion from\nmas yr\u22121 to km s\u22121 was based on the respective cluster distances (Table 1).\n\nThe second component is characterised by a higher average\nvelocity than the main one, but both have similar values of\ndispersion.\nIn the central parts of NGC 2477, the second component corresponds to about 40% of the member stars in the\nregion. This fraction drops to \u223c 17% when the overall cluster is considered. For NGC 2682, this component contains\nonly \u223c 7% of the stars in the central region. This fraction is\nconsistently the same for the UCAC3 and optical data. However, in the outer parts of NGC 2682, the second component\nis only seen in the optical data. Possible reasons for the\ndifference are: the optical PMDF corresponds to a smaller\nand somewhat more interior region (5\u2032 - 15\u2032 as compared to\n5\u2032 - 20\u2032 ), and contains \u223c 3 times as much stars as that of\nUCAC3. The bump appears only when the observed PMDF\nis clearly non-asymmetric with respect to the average velocity, thus displaying a broad wing towards high velocities,\n\ne.g. NGC 2477 and NGC 2682. On the other hand, there is\nno bump emerging from the essentially gaussian (observed)\nPMDFs of NGC 1039, NGC 2516, and NGC 7762 (Figs. 5\nand 6). In addition, it is interesting to note that the bump\nin the central region of NGC 2682 appears almost identically\nin PMDFs built with independent data sets.\nAnother issue is to what degree incompleteness in\ncrowded regions - and the more difficult measurement of\nPM components for faint stars - affect the PMDFs. Additionally, could the bump be related to incompleteness? We\nuse NGC 2477, the most distant and populous OC of our\nsample (thus, the most prone to suffering from incompleteness) to examine this point (App. B1). Since our analysis\ndepends on the number of member stars (especially at the\ncentral region), we selected J = 12.5 as the boundary between bright and faint stars. At the distance of NGC 2477,\nthis boundary corresponds to a stellar mass of m \u2248 1.6 M\u2299 .\n\n\fDeconvolved OC-velocity dispersion\nNGC2477\n1\n\nNGC2516\n\n385 stars\n\nNGC7762\n\n56 stars\n\n113 stars\n\n\u03c6(\u03bcos) [0'\u22125']\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n1\n850 stars\n\n207 stars\n\n1235 stars\n\n263 stars\n\n181 stars\n\n\u03c6(\u03bcos) [5'\u221220']\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n1\n294 stars\n\n\u03c6(\u03bcos) [0'\u221220']\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0\n\n5 10 15 20 25\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n15\n\n\u03bcos (mas yr )\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nFigure 6. Same as Fig. 5 for the remaining clusters.\n\nThe bright and faint deconvolved PMDFs built for the central region are similar (Fig. B3), consistently presenting the\nhigh-velocity bump at \u03bc\u0304 \u2248 12 mas yr\u22121 . The only significant difference is that the faint (less massive) star PMDF is\nshifted \u223c 1.3mas yr\u22121 towards high values of \u03bc\u0304 with respect to that of the bright stars. A similar shift occurs\nfor the bright and faint star PMDFs in the outer region\n(without the bump). Although relatively small, the shift\n\u2206\u03bc\u0304 \u2248 1.3 mas yr\u22121 \u2248 8 km s\u22121 between the bright and faint\nPMDFs might suggest slightly different kinematics for stars\nin different mass ranges. This experiment also suggests that\nincompleteness and PM measurements of faint stars - at\nleast to the level available in UCAC3 - are not critical for\nthe PMDFs.\nAdditionally, one might ask whether the bump may\ncome from residual, i.e. unaccounted for field contamination.\nIt is true that, given the statistical way we decontaminate\nthe clusters (Sect. 3), some field-star contribution might persist in the subtracted PMDFs. However, both NGC 2477 and\nNGC 2782 are located in the third Galactic quadrant and at\nhigh Galactic latitudes, which by itself minimises contamination (as can also be seen in Figs. B1 and B2). Thus, any\nresidual contamination should be minimum, which would\ncontradict the fraction of stars composing the bump, \u2248 40%\nin the central region of NGC 2477 and \u2248 7% in NGC 2682.\nThe above arguments suggest that the bump is related to\na cluster kinematic property, but we cannot definitely rule\nout the possibility that it might be an artefact of the RL\n\n7\n\ndeconvolution, and/or some residual contamination by stars\nwith peculiar PM components.\nThere is no direct interpretation for the additional\nbump seen in the deconvolved PMDFs of NGC 2477 and\nNGC 2682. Assuming that it is physical, one possibility is\nthat the double peak may arise from a merger of two clusters (as suggested by the referee, Thijs Kouwenhoven). In\nthis sense, de Oliveira, Bica & Dottori (2000) carried out Nbody simulations of cluster encounters, studying long-term\nstructural changes up to \u223c 1 Gyr. They found that the clusters may coalesce at such ages, but until then, the presence\nof the two clusters can still be traced by means isophotal\ndistortions and ellipticity variations, as observed in model\nand actual clusters (e.g. de Oliveira et al. 2000). In this scenario, internal differences in kinematics might persist too,\nproducing different signatures in the deconvolved PMDFs.\nAlternatively, the high-average velocity component may\nbe related to mass segregation, in which a fraction of the\nstars collectively migrate along the radial direction (over a\ntime-scale of a relaxation time) within a star cluster. In the\ncases dealt with here, it occurs only in the two most populous OCs, NGC 2477 and NGC 2682. Maybe it cannot be\ndetected (by the present approach) in the other OCs because\nthey are less populated (i.e., possibly the same reason why it\nis seen in the outer parts of NGC 2682 with the optical data,\nbut not with UCAC3). Finally, working with histograms and\na different PM-data set, Bica & Bonatto (2005) raised the\npossibility that the high-velocity component in NGC 2682\nmight be related to the presence of binaries. However, given\nthe findings of Kouwenhoven & de Grijs (2008), this possibility seems the least probable. In any case, a definitive solution for the bump nature would require detailed simulations\nof the internal cluster dynamics (including cluster merger,\nmass segregation, and binarity), a task that is beyond the\nscope of the present paper.\nThe velocity dispersions derived from the deconvolved\nPMDFs (Table 2) of NGC 1039 and NGC 2516 (and, to a\nlesser degree, NGC 2682), are consistent with those of (approximately virialized) OCs of \u223c 103 M\u2299 . On the other\nhand, those of NGC 2516 and NGC 2477 appear to be excessively high for OCs of a similar mass scale. However, such\nlarge dispersion values can be partly explained by an observational limitation related to distance, since both OCs are\nthe most distant of the sample. For a limited observational\ntime-base, the PM determination for a distant OC will primarily detect the high-PM components, thus leading to a\nbroad PM profile and high values of velocity dispersion. Under similar conditions, a nearby OC, on the other hand, will\nalso have part of the low-PM components detected, thus implying a lower velocity dispersion. This effect is present in\nour analysis, as can be seen by the correlation between \u03c3os\nand distance from the Sun (Fig. 7 - left panels). An additional consequence of the distance-related effect would be a\nshift towards high values of the on-sky average velocity (\u03bc\u0304).\nAgain, this shift would increase with the distance from the\nSun, and this relation is also present in Fig. 7. Despite this\neffect, the average velocity of the bump stars in NGC 2477\n(\u03bc\u0304 \u2248 78 km s\u22121 ) is exceedingly high for a \u223c 103 M\u2299 cluster, to the point that these stars - if they really belong\nto NGC 2477 - are not gravitationally bound to the cluster. This suggests that the high-velocity bump may be an\nartefact produced by the RL deconvolution (when applied\n\n\f8\n\nC. Bonatto and E.

Besides\nthe main component, the deconvolution revealed structure\nin the profiles of NGC 2477 and NGC 2682 in the form of\na second - and less populous - distribution shifted towards\nhigher average velocities, which may originate from cluster\nmerger, large-scale mass segregation or, least probably, binaries. The secondary bump in NGC 2477 consistently appears in PMDFs built with stars brighter and fainter than\nJ = 12.5, which suggests that it is not related to incompleteness and/or faint star-PM measurement. However, we\ncannot exclude the possibility that the bump is an artefact produced by the RL deconvolution when applied to\nstrongly asymmetric profiles such as those of NGC 2477 and\nNGC 2682. NGC 1039 and NGC 2516, the nearest OCs analysed here, end up with deconvolved dispersions compatible\nwith those expected of bound OCs of \u223c 103 M\u2299 . We also\ndetect an increase of the velocity dispersion and average velocity with distance from the Sun, which is probably due to\na similarly limited time-base used for measuring the proper\nmotions among different star clusters.\nIn recent years our group has given particular attention\nto the investigation of OCs by means of analytical tools that\nproduce field-star decontaminated CMDs and RDPs. These\ntools have proved essential for a constrained analysis of OCs\ncharacterised by a range of parameters (age, distance from\nthe Sun, reddening, etc), and located on a wide variety of\nenvironments (e.g. Bonatto & Bica 2010b; Bonatto & Bica\n2007; Bonatto et al. 2006). The present paper links the classical CMD and RDP analyses with a novel approach for\ndealing with proper motions and the respective errors.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nA crucial point in understanding a cluster's dynamical stage\nis the derivation of kinematical parameters for its member\nstars, usually by means of proper motions obtained in public\ndatabases. However, uncertainties associated with groundbased proper motion measurements are usually large, and\ntheir effect should be properly taken into account when\nbuilding PM profiles for determining the velocity dispersion.\nIn this paper we investigate the above issue using the relatively nearby and populous open clusters\nNGC 1039 (M 34), NGC 2477, NGC 2516, NGC 2682 (M 67),\nand NGC 7762 as test cases. Their PM components have\nbeen obtained in UCAC3.\nRather than working with PM histograms, we build\nPMDFs for the cluster and field stars, taking the 1\u03c3-PM uncertainties into account. In short, (i) we use the CMD morphology for establishing the colour and magnitude ranges of\nthe probable member stars, (ii) these stars are used to build\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank the referee, Thijs Kouwenhoven, for interesting\ncomments and suggestions.

Top: variation with the number of deconvolution\niterations of the on-sky velocity dispersion \u03c3os (left) and average\nvelocity \u03bc\u0304 (right).

The curves correspond to the 0\u2032 \u2212 20\u2032 PMDFs, except\nfor the optical PMDF of NGC 2682 built for 0\u2032 \u2212 15\u2032 .\n\nfor |\u2206pm | = 10 \u2212 30 mas yr\u22121 , \u03b4pm = 5 mas yr\u22121 for\n|\u2206pm | = 30 \u2212 50 mas yr\u22121 , and \u03b4pm = 10 mas yr\u22121 for\n\u2206pm > 50 mas yr\u22121 and \u2206pm < \u221250 mas yr\u22121 . Additionally, this procedure also has the advantage of reducing computation time.\n\nA2\n\nDeconvolution convergence\n\nThe rather slow convergence rate of the RL deconvolution method has been extensively discussed in the literature\n(e.g. Bi & Boerner 1994; Vio, Bardsley & Wamsteker 2005).\nHowever, it is easy to implement, reliable, and the quality\nof the outputs can be followed at each iteration.\nWe follow in Fig. A1 the changes on \u03c3os and \u03bc\u0304 with the\nnumber of deconvolution iterations (Nit ). While the average\nvelocity (panel b) changes little over the 200 iterations applied here, \u03c3os , on the other hand, decreases systematically\nwith Nit (panel a) but with a rate that begins to flatten\nfor Nit & 100. Clearly, \u03c3os could decrease somewhat more\nfor Nit > 200. However, as implied by the rate of change\nf\u03c3os = \u2206\u03c3os /\u03c3os that, for Nit = 200 has decreased to\nf\u03c3os . 0.003 (panel c), it would take several hundred more\niterations to produce a significant change in \u03c3os . Finally,\nthe chi-square (Sect. 4) fractional variation f\u03c7 = \u2206\u03c7/\u03c7 also\npresents a steady decrease with Nit (panel d), dropping to\nf\u03c7 \u223c 0.003 (or a \u223c 0.3% variation) for Nit = 200.\n\n\fC.

The panels show the observed, field, and intrinsic\nerror (PSF) on-sky PMDFs built for different cluster regions: central (top), outer (middle) and overall (bottom). The number of\nmember stars in each region is indicated.\n\nAPPENDIX B: OBSERVED AND FIELD PMDFS\nWe show in Figs. B1 and B2 the observed on-sky PMDFs\nfor all clusters of our sample, built for the central, outer,\nand overall cluster regions. Also shown are the PMDFs corresponding to the intrinsic error distribution (PSF) and the\nfield. It is interesting to note the relative contribution of the\nfield stars PM among the different regions of the same cluster and among the full set of clusters. This shows that the\nfield contribution must be taken into account in the analysis. Also, and perhaps more importantly is the PSF width\nthat, in some cases, is almost as broad as the cluster PMDF.\nB1\n\n56 stars\n\n0.4\n\n160 stars\n\n0.6\n\n0\n\nNGC7762\n\n0.2\n\n0.8\n\n0\n1\n\n0.6\n\n385 stars\n\nNGC2516\n\nPMDFs in different magnitude ranges\n\nIn Fig. B3 we examine the incompleteness/faint stars issue in\nNGC 2477, which should be important especially for the central part of the cluster. Starting with the CMD of NGC 2477\n(Fig. 2), we build PMDFs separately for stars brighter and\nfainter than J = 12.5. This magnitude boundary is adequate\nfor characterising different types of stars and, at the same\ntime, keeping a reasonable number of stars in each magnitude range. The bright and faint PMDFs are compared to\nthe \"full-magnitude\" range PMDF, both for the central (left\npanel) and outer (right) cluster region.\n\n0\n\n0 15 30 45 60 75\n\n0 15 30 45 60 75\n\u22121\n\n\u03bcos (mas yr )\n\n0 15 30 45 60 75\n\nFigure B2.
