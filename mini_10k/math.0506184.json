In this note, we will discuss what kind of operators between C*-algebras preserves Jordan triple products {a, b, c} = (ab\u2217 c + cb\u2217 a)/2. These include especially isometries and disjointness\npreserving operators.\n\n1. Introduction\nRecall that a Banach algebra A is an algebra with a norm k * k such that kabk \u2264 kakkbk, and every\nCauchy sequence converges. A complex Banach algebra A is a C*-algebra if there is an involution\n\n\u2217\n\ndefined on A such that ka\u2217 ak = kak2 . A special example is B(H), the algebra of all bounded linear\noperators on a (complex) Hilbert space H. By the Gelfand-Naimark-Segel Theorem, C*-algebras are\nexactly those norm closed *-subalgebras of B(H). An abelian C*-algebra A can also be represented as\nthe algebra C0 (X) of continuous functions on a locally compact Hausdorff space X vanishing at infinity.\nX is compact if and only if A is unital.\nIt is well known that the algebraic structure determines the geometric (norm) structure of a C*algebra A. Indeed, the norm of a self-adjoint element a of A coincides with the spectral radius of\na, and the latter is a pure algebraic object. In general, the norm of an arbitrary element a of A is\nequal to ka\u2217 ak1/2 , and a\u2217 a is self-adjoint. For an abelian C*-algebra A = C0 (X), we note that the\nunderlying space X can be considered as the maximal ideal space of A consisting of nonzero complex\nhomomorphisms (= linear and multiplicative functionals) of A. The topology of X is the hull-kernel\ntopology, and thus be solely determined by the algebraic structure of A.\nIn this note, we will discuss how much the algebraic structure can be recovered if we know the norm,\nor other, structure of a C*-algebra. In particular, isometries and disjointness preserving operators of\nC*-algebras preserve triple products {a, b, c} = (ab\u2217 c + cb\u2217 a)/2.\nThe author is very grateful to our late friend, Kosita Beidar, from whom he learned how to look at\na seemingly pure analytic problem from the point of view of an algebraist.\nDate: August 30, 2004; to appear in Southeast Asian Bulletin of Mathematics.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 46L05, 46B04, 47B48, 17C65.\nKey words and phrases.

The geometric structure determines the algebraic structure\nSuppose T : A \u2212\u2192 B is an isometric linear embedding between C*-algebras. That is, kT xk = kxk\nfor all x in A. We are interested in knowing what kind of algebraic structure T inherits from A to its\nrange, which is in general just a Banach subspace of B. We begin with two famous results.\nTheorem 2.1. (Banach and Stone; see, e.g., [6]) Let X and Y be locally compact Hausdorff spaces.\nLet T : C0 (X) \u2212\u2192 C0 (Y ) be a surjective linear isometry. Then T is a weighted composition operator\nT f = h * f \u25e6 \u03c6,\n\n\u2200f \u2208 C0 (X),\n\nwhere h is a continuous scalar function on Y with |h(y)| \u2261 1, and \u03c6 is a homeomorphism from Y onto\nX. Consequently, two abelian C*-algebras are isomorphic as Banach spaces if, and only if, they are\nisomorphic as \u2217 -algebras.\nHere is a sketch of the proof. Let T \u2217 : M (Y ) \u2212\u2192 M (X) be the dual map of T , which is again a\nsurjective linear isometry from the Banach space M (Y ) = C0 (Y )\u2217 of all bounded Radon measures on Y\nonto that on X. Restricting T \u2217 to the dual unit balls, which are weak* compact and convex, we get an\naffine homeomorphism. Since the nonzero extreme points of the dual unit balls are exactly unimodular\nscalar multiples of point masses, T \u2217 sends a point mass \u03b4y to \u03bb\u03b4x . Here y \u2208 Y , x \u2208 X and |\u03bb| = 1. We\nwrite x = \u03c6(y) and \u03bb = h(y) to indicate that x and \u03bb depend on y. It follows that\nT f (y) = T \u2217 (\u03b4y )(f ) = h(y)\u03b4\u03c6(y) (f ) = h(y)f (\u03c6(y)).\nIt is then routine to see that h is unimodular and continuous on Y , and that \u03c6 is a homeomorphism\nfrom Y onto X.\nTheorem 2.2 (Kadison [7]). Let A and B be C*-algebras. Let T : A \u2212\u2192 B be a surjective linear\nisometry. Then there is a unitary element u in B\u0303 = B \u2295 C1, the unitalization of B, and a Jordan\n\u2217\n\n-isomorphism J : A \u2212\u2192 B such that\nT a = uJ(a),\n\n\u2200a \u2208 A.\n\nConsequently, two C*-algebras are isomorphic as Banach spaces if, and only if, they are isomorphic as\nJordan \u2217 -algebras.\nRecall that a Jordan \u2217 -homomorphism J preserves linear sums, involutions and Jordan products:\na \u25e6 b = (ab + ba)/2. It is easy to see that the abelian case can also be written in this form with u = h\nand Jf = f \u25e6 \u03c6. In general, the product of a pair of elements in A can be decomposed into two parts\nab = a \u25e6 b + [a, b], the sum of the Jordan product and the Lie product [a, b] = (ab \u2212 ba)/2. It is plain that\na \u25e6 b = b \u25e6 a is commutative and [a, b] = \u2212[b, a] is anti-commutative. However they are not associative.\nThe Kadison theorem states that the norm structure of a C*-algebra determines completely its Jordan\nstructure.\n\n\fTRIPLE HOMOMORPHISMS OF C*-ALGEBRAS\n\n3\n\nIt is interesting to note that Jordan products are determined by squares:\na\u25e6b=\n\n(a + b)2 \u2212 a2 \u2212 b2\n,\n2\n\n\u2200a, b \u2208 A.\n\nA similar algebraic structure exists in C*-algebras, namely, the Jordan triple products:\n{a, b, c} =\n\nab\u2217 c + cb\u2217 a\n.\n2\n\nThere is also a polar identity for triples:\n{a, b, c} =\n\n1 X X\n\u03b1\u03b2{a + \u03b1b + \u03b2c}(3) ,\n8 2\n4\n\u03b1 =1 \u03b2 =1\n\nHence, a linear map T between C*-algebras preserves triple products if and only if it preserves cubes\na(3) = {a, a, a} = aa\u2217 a.\nKaup [8] generalizes Kadison theorem: a linear surjection between C*-algebras T : A \u2212\u2192 B is an\nisometry if and only if it preserves triple products. A geometric proof of the Kadison Theorem is given\nby Dang, Friedman and Russo [3]. It goes first to note that a norm exposed face of the dual unit ball\nUB \u2217 is of the form Fu = {\u03c6 \u2208 B \u2217 : k\u03c6k = \u03c6(u) \u2264 1} for a unique partial isometry u in B \u2217\u2217 . For two \u03c6, \u03c8\nin B \u2217 , they are said to be orthogonal to each other if they have polar decompositions \u03c6 = u|\u03c6|, \u03c8 = v|\u03c8|\nsuch that u \u22a5 v, i.e., u\u2217 v = uv \u2217 = 0. This amounts to say that k\u03c6 \u00b1 \u03c8k = k\u03c6k + k\u03c8k. Two faces Fu , Fv\nare orthogonal if and only if u \u22a5 v. Then they verify that the dual map T \u2217 of the surjective linear\nisometry T maps faces to faces and preserves orthogonality. Consequently, T \u2217\u2217 : A\u2217\u2217 \u2212\u2192 B \u2217\u2217 sends\northogonal partial isometries to orthogonal partial isometries. By the spectral theory, every element a in\nP\nA \u2282 A\u2217\u2217 can be approximated in norm by a finite linear sum of orthogonal partial isometries j \u03bbj uj .\nP (3)\nThen its cube a(3) can also be approximated by j \u03bbj uj . It follows that T (a(3) ) and (T a)(3) can both\nP (3)\nbe approximated by j \u03bbj T \u2217\u2217 uj . Hence T (a(3) ) = (T a)(3) , and thus T preserves triple products by\nthe polar identity.\n\nWe note that the above (geometric) proof of the Kadison theorem depends very much on the fact\nthe range of the isometry is again a C*-algebra. Extending the Holsztynski theorem [4, 6], Chu and\nWong [2] studied non-surjective linear isometries between C*-algebras.\nTheorem 2.3 (Chu and Wong [2]). Let A and B be C*-algebras and let T be a linear isometry from\nA into B. There is a largest closed projection p in B \u2217\u2217 such that T (*)p : A \u2212\u2192 B \u2217\u2217 is a Jordan triple\nhomomorphism and\nT (ab\u2217 c + cb\u2217 a)p = T (a)T (b)\u2217T (c)p + T (c)T (b)\u2217 T (a)p,\n\n\u2200a, b, c \u2208 A.\n\nWhen A is abelian, we have kT (a)pk = kak for all a in A. In particular, T reduces locally to a Jordan\ntriple isomorphism on the JB*-triple generated by any a in A, also an abelian C*-algebra, by a closed\nprojection pa .\n\n\f4\n\nNGAI-CHING WONG\n\nBesides the triple technique, the proof of the above theorem makes use of the concept of representing\nelements of a C*-algebra as special sections of a continuous field of Hilbert spaces developed in [10]. It\nis still geometric.\n3. Disjointness preserving operators are triple homomorphisms\nIn this section, we do not assume the operator T is isometric. Although the following statement\nmight have been known to experts, we provide a new and short proof here as we do not find any in the\nliterature.\nTheorem 3.1. Let T : A \u2212\u2192 B be a bounded linear map between C*-algebras. Then T is a triple\nhomomorphism if and only if T \u2217\u2217 sends partial isometries of A\u2217\u2217 to partial isometries of B \u2217\u2217 .\nProof. One direction is trivial. Suppose T \u2217\u2217 sends partial isometries of A\u2217\u2217 to partial isometries of\nB \u2217\u2217 . Let u, v be two partial isometries in A. Observe that they are orthogonal to each other, namely,\nu\u2217 v = uv \u2217 = 0, if and only if they have orthogonal initial spaces and orthogonal range spaces. This\namounts to saying that u + \u03bbv is a partial isometry for all scalar \u03bb with |\u03bb| = 1. Consequently, T sends\northogonal partial isometries to orthogonal partial isometries. For every a in A \u2282 A\u2217\u2217 , approximate a in\nP\nnorm by a finite linear sum n \u03bbn un of orthogonal partial isometries in A\u2217\u2217 . Then its cube a(3) = aa\u2217 a\nP (3)\ncan also be approximated in norm by n \u03bbn un . It follows that T a and T (a(3) ) can be approximated\nP\nP\nin norm by n \u03bbn T \u2217\u2217 un and n \u03bbn (3) T \u2217\u2217 un , respectively. This gives T (a(3) ) = (T a)(3) , \u2200a \u2208 A. By\nthe polar identity, we see that T is a triple homomorphism.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe say that a linear map T : A \u2212\u2192 B between C*-algebras is disjointness preserving if\na\u2217 b = ab\u2217 = 0\n\nimplies\n\n(T a)\u2217 (T b) = (T a)(T b)\u2217 = 0,\n\n\u2200a, b \u2208 A.\n\nClearly, T is disjointness preserving if and only if it preserves disjointness of partial isometries. It is\nclear that every triple homomorphism preserves disjointness. Looking at the well-known result of Jarosz\n[5, 6] in the abelian case, we see that not every disjointness preserving map is a triple homomorphism.\nIndeed, let T : C0 (X) \u2212\u2192 C0 (Y ) be a bounded disjointness preserving linear map between abelian\nC*-algebras. Then there is a closed subset Y0 of Y on which every T f vanishes. On Y1 = Y \\ Y0 there is\na bounded continuous function h and a continuous map \u03c6 from Y1 into X such that T f|Y1 = h * f \u25e6 \u03c6 for\nall f in C0 (X). Hence, T is a triple homomorphism if and only if T \u2217\u2217 1 is a partial isometry in C0 (Y )\u2217\u2217 .\nWe end this note with a proof of this fact for the non-abelian case.\nTheorem 3.2. Let T : A \u2212\u2192 B be a bounded linear map between C*-algebras. Then T is a triple\nhomomorphism if and only if T is disjointness preserving and T \u2217\u2217 1 is a partial isometry in B \u2217\u2217 .\nProof. We verify the sufficiency only. For simplicity of notations, denote again by T the bidual map of\nT from A\u2217\u2217 into B \u2217\u2217 .\n\n\fTRIPLE HOMOMORPHISMS OF C*-ALGEBRAS\n\n5\n\nLet a be a self-adjoint element of A. Identify the commutative C*-subalgebra of A generated by 1 and\na with C(X), where X \u2286 [0, kak] is the spectrum of a.

For 1 < j < k, we can find two sequences {fm }m\nand {gm }m in C(X)\u2229A such that fm gm+p = 0 for m, p = 0, 1, . . ., fm \u2192 1Xj and gm \u2192 1Xk pointwisely\non X. By the weak\u2217 continuity of T , we see that\nT (1Xk )T (fm )\u2217 = lim T (gm+p )T (fm )\u2217 = 0\n\nfor all m = 1, 2, . . ..\n\np\u2192\u221e\n\nThus\nT (1Xk )T (1Xj )\u2217 = lim T (1Xk )T (fm )\u2217 = 0.\nm\u2192\u221e\n\nSimilarly, we have\nT (1Xk )\u2217 T (1Xj ) = 0.\nWhen j = 1, we note that 1X1 is an open projection in A\u2217\u2217 . Hence there is an increasing net {a\u03bb }\u03bb\nin A converges to 1X1 weakly (see [9, Proposition 3.11.9], and also [1]). Using an argument similar to\nabove, we still get\nT (1Xk )T (1X1 )\u2217 = T (1Xk )\u2217 T (1X1 ) = 0.\nConsequently, for each j = 1, 2, . . . , n, we have\nX\nT (1)T (1Xj )\u2217 T (1) =\nT (1Xn )T (1Xj )\u2217 T (1Xm ) = (T (1Xj ))(3) .\nm,n\n\nThis gives\n\nX\n\nT (1Xn ) = T 1 = (T 1)(3) =\n\nn\n\nX\n\n(T (1Xn ))(3) .\n\nn\n\nMultiplying the above identity on the left by T (1Xn ) and ((T (1Xn ))(3) )\u2217 respectively, we see that\n\u2217\n\n(T (1Xn ) \u2212 ((T (1Xn ))(3) )\u2217 (T (1Xn ) \u2212 ((T (1Xn ))(3) ) = 0.\nHence T (1Xn ) is a partial isometry for each n and orthogonal to the others. It follows that\n!(3)\nX\nX\n(3)\n(T (f )) = lim\nf (xn )T (1Xn )\n= lim\nf (xn )(3) (T (1Xn ))(3)\nn\n\n= lim\n\nX\n\nn\n\n(3)\n\nf (xn )\n\nT (1Xn ) = T (f\n\n(3)\n\n),\n\nn\n\nfor all f in C(X). By the polar identity, T preserves triple products in C(X). Let p = T 1\u2217T 1 and\nq = T 1T 1\u2217 be the initial and range projections of the partial isometry T 1, respectively. We have\n2T f = 2T {1, 1, f } = qT f + T f p,\nIt then follows that\nT f = qT f = T f p,\n\n\u2200f \u2208 C(X).\n\n\f6\n\nNGAI-CHING WONG\n\nfor all f in C(X). Thus for each self-adjoint element a of A,\nT (a(3) ) = (T a)(3)\n\n(1)\n\nand T a = qT a = T ap.\n\nAt this point, we assume further that T 1 = p = q is a projection. It then follows from (1) that for\nevery self-adjoint element a of A,\nT a = T (a\u2217 ) = T {1, a, 1} = {T 1, a, T 1} = T 1(T a)\u2217T 1 = (T a)\u2217 .\nTherefore, T also preserves self-adjointness. For any self-adjoint elements a, b of A, by observing the\nidentities T (a \u00b1 b)(3) = (T (a \u00b1 b))(3) , we also see that T (aba) = T aT bT a. Altogether, it follows that\nT (a + ib)(3) = (T (a + ib))(3) . In other words, T is a triple homomorphism from A into B.\nIn general, we consider the map J = T 1\u2217 T from A into T 1\u2217 T A \u2286 B \u2217\u2217 . It follows from (1) that J is\nalso disjointness preserving. Since J1 = T 1\u2217 T 1 = p is a projection, J is a triple homomorphism. Hence\nJ(a(3) ) = (Ja)(3) , and thus\nT 1\u2217T (a(3) ) = T 1\u2217 T a(T a)\u2217T 1T 1\u2217T a = T 1\u2217 T a(T a)\u2217qT a = T 1\u2217 (T a)(3) ,\nfor all a in A by (1). Therefore,\nqT (a(3) ) = T 1T 1\u2217T (a(3) ) = T 1T 1\u2217(T a)(3) = q(T a)(3) ,\nand then by (1) again,\nT (a(3) ) = (T a)(3) ,\n\n\u2200a \u2208 A.\n\nThis says T is a triple homomorphism from A into B.\n\n\u0003\n\nReferences\n[1] L.
