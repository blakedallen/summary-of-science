In the flavor basis where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal,\nthe (effective) neutrino mass matrix M\u03bd has nine free parameters: three masses (m1 , m2 and m3 ),\nthree mixing angles (\u03b8x , \u03b8y and \u03b8z ) and three phases (two Majorana-type \u03c1, \u03c3 and one Dirac-type \u03b4).\nExperimental data [2, 3, 4, 5] put constraints on the values of the masses and the mixing angles; whereas\nno definite experimental measurements of the phases exist up till now. The recent global analysis of\noscillation data[6] that includes the latest T2K[7] and MINOS[8] results reveals a relatively large value\nfor the mixing angle \u03b8z , in contrast with the old global analysis[9] that was consistent with vanishing\n\u03b8z . The Daya Bay experiment [10] confirm the non-vanishing \u03b8z and is in agreement with the findings\nof [6]. This in turn opens the door for studying the CP violation in neutrino oscillations with profound\nimplications for our understanding of matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. The non-vanishing\n\u03b8z provide a guaranteed, albeit small, contribution to the third neutrino mass m3 for both single and\ndouble beta decay searches that must be accounted for in detailed analysis. From a theoretical point of\nview, the relatively large mixing angle \u03b8z may call for new ideas in model building.\n\u2217 elashin@ictp.it\n\u2020 nchamoun@th.physik.uni-bonn.de\n\n1\n\n\fSeveral schemes have been proposed in the literature to reduce the number of free parameters, some\nof which consist in equalling some elements, or some combinations of elements, of M\u03bd to zero. It was\nfound that three independent zeros-texture can not accommodate the data, whereas nine patterns of\ntwo independent zeros-texture, out of fifteen possible, can do this [11, 12]). The recent analysis of two\nzero-texures[13], based on the latest T2K and Minos oscillation data, constrain further the number of\nviable patterns to be equal to seven. In [14], a specific model realizing any of the possible six patterns\nof one zero-texture was provided. However, it led always to one of the neutrino masses equaling to zero.\nBased on preceding works, such as [15], the analysis of the phenomenological implications of single-zero\ntextures was carried out in [16], and it showed the viability of the six possible one zero-textures combined\nwith several interesting conclusions. It is of great importance to reexamine the one-zero textures, in light\nof the new oscillation data, in order to decide whether the six possible cases are still viable or not, and\nthe purpose of this paper is to present such a study.\nThe seesaw mechanism of either type-I or -II, in addition to its role in understanding the scale of the\nneutrino masses, can help, when combined with discrete Abelian flavor symmetry, in realizing the zero\ntexture patterns in the neutrino mass matrix. More specifically, the light neutrino mass matrix M\u03bd in\nthe framework of the type-I seesaw mechanism is given by:\nM\u03bd\n\nT\n= MD MR\u22121 MD\n.\n\n(1)\n\nwhere MD is the Dirac neutrino mass matrix, and MR is the Majorana mass matrix of the right handed\nsinglet neutrinos. It has been noted [17, 18] that the zeros of MD and MR can find their way to enforce\nzeros in M\u03bd , in such a way that one can construct theoretical models enforcing specific patterns with\nzeros located at certain positions of MR and MD in order to get the desired texture for M\u03bd . However,\nthe zeros of MD and MR may not only show up as zeros in M\u03bd , and one interesting possibility is that\nthey appear as zero minors in M\u03bd .\nPhenomenological analysis of vanishing minors was first studied in [19] assuming the invertibility\nof M\u03bd , in which case they amount to zeros in the inverse neutrino mass matrix M\u03bd\u22121 . This condition\nwas relaxed in [20] and [21] where a phenomenological analysis of single or double vanishing minors was\ncarried out. Moreover, one can generalize the zero-textures in other ways. The simultaneous existence of\na vanishing one minor and a texture zero element was studied in [22], whereas two vanishing subtraces\ntexture was studied in [23].\nIn this work, carrying out an updated phenomenological analysis of the one-zero textures in view of\nthe recent oscillation data, we have paralleled the procedure done in [21], for both singular and invertible\nneutrino mass matrices, without assuming any specific model. Our present analysis is different in one\nrespect that we let \u03b4m2 , characterizing the solar neutrino mass-squared difference, vary randomly within\nits experimentally allowed range, instead of fixing it to its central value as was done in[21]. Thus we need,\nin addition to the 'two real' conditions corresponding to the one-zero element texture, six parameters in\norder to determine the neutrino mass matrix. We thus vary the six mixing and phase angles (\u03b8x , \u03b8y , \u03b8z , \u03b4, \u03c1\nand \u03c3) within their experimentally acceptable regions, and in this way we can determine in the parameter\nspace of (\u03b8x , \u03b8y , \u03b8z , \u03b4, \u03c1, \u03c3, \u03b4m2 ) the regions consistent with the other experimental results. We found that\nall the six patterns could accommodate the data. Moreover, five textures allow also for singular models,\nwhere one of the masses equals zero, making room for the data.\nWe use the type-I seesaw formula to present some theoretical realizations of all the one-zero textures,\nsingular or not, where, in both cases, we can call for non-diagonal form Dirac neutrino mass matrix,\nin order to reproduce just one zero element in M\u03bd . We find also a simple and direct way to realize\nthe one-zero textures using the type-II seesaw scheme. In addition, we note a correspondence-mapping\nbetween the one vanishing minor analysis and the one-zero texture analysis amounting to inverting the\nmasses and reflecting the phases. This serves qualitatively to relate the two phenomenological analyses.\nHowever, this map is not valid for the singular case, and whereas the singular vanishing minor model\npresented in [21] was not very predictive, the one-zero singular models are quite rich in phenomenology,\nand can not be related to the analysis of [21].\nThe plan of the paper is as follows: in section 2, we review the standard notation for the neutrino mass\nmatrix and its relation to the experimental constraints. In section 3, we present the one-zero texture in\nM\u03bd and compute the expressions of the two neutrino mass ratios. In section 4, we classify all the patterns\nand present the results and the phenomenological analysis of each case. Section 5 is devoted to the study\n2\n\n\fof singular one-zero textures. We present symmetry realizations of all patterns, based on type-I or -II\nseesaw schemes, in section 6 and end up with conclusions in section 7.\n\n2\n\nStandard notation\n\nIn the flavor basis, where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal, one can diagonalize the symmetric\nneutrino mass matrix M\u03bd by a unitary transformation,\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nm1 0\n0\n(2)\nV \u2020 M \u03bd V \u2217 = \uf8ed 0 m2 0 \uf8f8 ,\n0\n0 m3\n\nwith mi (for i = 1, 2, 3) real and positive.

(18). Here, it is assumed that cos \u03b4 = \u00b11 and that new reactor fluxes\nhave been used[6].\nAs to the non oscillation parameters hmie , \u03a3 and hmiee , we adopt the less conservative 2-\u03c3 range as\nreported in [26] for the first two, while for hmiee we use values found in [27]:\n\n3\n\nhmie\n\n<\n\n1.8 eV,\n\n\u03a3\n\n<\n\n1.19 eV,\n\nhmiee\n\n<\n\n0.34 \u2212 0.78 eV.\n\n(24)\n\nNeutrino mass matrices with one zero texture\n\nSince the neutrino matrix is symmetric then we have six independent possibilities for one vanishing entry,\neach of which is called one-zero texture.\nThe vanishing condition at the location (a, b) is written as:\nM\u03bd ab = 0\n\n(25)\n\nwhich amounts to\n3\nX\n\nUaj Ubj \u03bbj\n\nj=1\n\n5\n\n=\n\n0.\n\n(26)\n\n\fThis leads to:\nm1\nm3\nm2\nm3\n\n=\n=\n\nRe(A3 )Im(A2 e2i\u03c3 ) \u2212 Re(A2 e2i\u03c3 )Im(A3 )\nRe(A2 e2i\u03c3 )Im(A1 e2i\u03c1 ) \u2212 Re(A1 e2i\u03c1 )Im(A2 e2i\u03c3 )\nRe(A1 e2i\u03c1 )Im(A3 ) \u2212 Re(A3 )Im(A1 e2i\u03c1 )\nRe(A2 e2i\u03c3 )Im(A1 e2i\u03c1 ) \u2212 Re(A1 e2i\u03c1 )Im(A2 e2i\u03c3 )\n\n(27)\n\nwhere\nAj\n\n=\n\nUaj Ubj ,\n\n(no sum over j).\n\n(28)\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, one can completely reconstruct the neutrino mass matrix in terms\nof the six mixing and phase angles, assuming a given one-zero texture and fixing a value for \u03b4m2 within\nits acceptable range. We span (\u03b8x , \u03b8y , \u03b8z , \u03b4m2 ) over their experimentally allowed regions, whereas the\nphases (\u03b4, \u03c1, and \u03c3) are varied in their full ranges. We thus can determine in the parameter space the\nacceptable regions compatible with the other experimental constraints as given in Table (1) and Eq. (24).\nOne can then illustrate graphically all the possible correlations, in the three levels of \u03c3-error, between\nany two physical neutrino parameters. We chose to plot for each pattern and for each type of hierarchy\nthirty correlations at the 3-\u03c3 error level involving the parameters (m1 , m2 , m3 , \u03b8x , \u03b8y , \u03b8z , \u03c1, \u03c3, \u03b4, J, mee )\nand the lowest neutrino mass (LNM). Moreover, for each parameter, one can determine the extremum\nvalues it can take according to the considered precision level, and we listed in tables these predictions for\nall the patterns and for the three \u03c3-error levels.\nWe found that the resulting mass patterns could be classified into three categories:\n\u2022 Normal hierarchy: characterized by m1 < m2 < m3 and is denoted by N. It satisfies numerically\nthe bound:\nm1\nm2\n<\n< 0.7\n(29)\nm3\nm3\n\u2022 Inverted hierarchy: characterized by m3 < m1 < m2 and is denoted by I. It satisfies the bound:\nm1\nm2\n>\n> 1.3\n(30)\nm3\nm3\n\u2022 Degenerate hierarchy (meaning quasi- degeneracy): characterized by m1 \u2248 m2 \u2248 m3 and is denoted\nby D. The corresponding numeric bound is taken to be:\nm2\nm1\n<\n< 1.3\n(31)\n0.7 <\nm3\nm3\nMoreover, we studied for each pattern the possibility of having a singular (non-invertible) mass matrix.\nThe viable singular mass matrix is characterized by one of the masses (m1 , and m3 ) being equal to zero,\nas compatibility with the data prevents the simultaneous vanishing of two masses and thus m2 can not\neither vanish. The detailed investigation of singular one-zero textures is presented in Section 5.\nOne can relate the one zero-textures analysis to the analysis of the one vanishing minor texture. This\ncomes because Eq. (2) can be put, assuming M\u03bd is invertible, in an equivalent form:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n1\nT\n\u22121\nV M\u03bd V = Diag\n(32)\n,\n,\nm1 m2 m3\nBy comparing the two forms, we see that we can write the inverse mass matrix in the same form as the\nmass matrix after having inverted the masses and having conjugated the phases. Since a zero in M\u03bd\u22121\nis equivalent to a vanishing minor for M\u03bd , we get a mapping between the one-zero textures and the one\nvanishing minor patterns in the following sense. Suppose a one-zero texture at entry (a, b) led to an\nanalytical relation in terms of the free parameters of the form:\nf (m1 , m2 , m3 , \u03b8x , \u03b8y , \u03b8z , \u03c1, \u03c3, \u03b4)\n\n= 0\n\n(33)\n\nthen one can deduce that a vanishing minor at the same location (a, b) would lead to an analytical relation\nof the form\nf(\n\n1\n1\n1\n,\n,\n, \u03b8x , \u03b8y , \u03b8z , \u2212\u03c1, \u2212\u03c3, \u2212\u03b4) \u2261 g(m1 , m2 , m3 , \u03b8x , \u03b8y , \u03b8z , \u03c1, \u03c3, \u03b4)\nm1 m2 m3\n6\n\n=\n\n0\n\n(34)\n\n\fHowever, phenomenologically speaking, one can only qualitatively relate the correlations obtained in\n[21] with the correlations corresponding to the one-zero textures in this paper, even when using the same\nneutrino data. In fact, inverting the masses would change the hierarchy type from normal into inverted\nand vice versa, whereas the degenerate hierarchy will keep its type. Now, if the \u03a3 constraint (equation\n24), say, was satisfied for a one-zero texture, then upon inverting the masses it might stop being satisfied\nin the corresponding vanishing minor pattern. Thus, we conclude that the experimental bounds on the\nmasses are not symmetric with respect to the mapping, and hence one can not deduce quantitatively\nthe experimentally acceptable regions in the parameter space from those of [21]. Lastly, this equivalence\nmapping is no more valid for the singular models, where one of the masses is equal to zero. Actually,\nthe predictiveness of the singular model in [21] was weak, whereas it is quite powerful in the singular\none-zero texture models.\nAs to the symmetry T1 introduced in Eqs.(7-8), it induces equivalence between different textures as,\n(M\u03bd 12 = 0) \u2194 (M\u03bd 13 = 0) and (M\u03bd 22 = 0) \u2194 (M\u03bd 33 = 0). However, this equivalence for \u03b8y is a reflection\nabout the first bisectrix, i.e. it maps the \u03b8y from the first octant to the second octant and vice versa.\nSimilarly, the image points of the map differ in \u03b4 from their original points by a shift equal to \u03c0. This\nmeans that the accepted points for a pattern imply for the equivalent pattern the same accepted points\nbut after changing the \u03b8y and \u03b4 correspondingly. Unfortunately the recent oscillation data presented in\nTable (1), has a range for \u03b8y which is not perfectly symmetric about the first bisectrix especially for the\n1-\u03c3 and 2-\u03c3 level values, thus making the T1 symmetry of limited use in relating the equivalent patterns.\nHowever, at the 3-\u03c3 level, the range of \u03b8y is nearly symmetric about the first bisectrix, and so the T1 symmetry is in action and the phenomenology of any pattern can be deduced from its T1 -symmetric\nequivalent one. Hence, the equivalence between different patterns should be taken carefully especially for\ndata determined at the 1- and 2-\u03c3 level.\nThus, it is enough now to present four possible cases, instead of six ones, corresponding to one zero\ntexture. We stated, simple writing permitting, only the leading terms in powers of sz of the analytical\nexpressions in terms of (\u03b8x , \u03b8y , \u03b8z , \u03b4, \u03c1 and \u03c3). Moreover, since the mapping (Eq. 34) should be valid term\nby term to all orders of the expansion in powers of sz , as the parameter \u03b8z is not affected by the mapping,\nthen we could indeed check our leading order formulae by comparing them to those of [21]. Also, we have\nverified in the patterns where the obtained formulae are all exact (not expanded), i.e. (M11 ) here and\n(C11 ) in [21], the validity of the mapping, which provided an additional crosscheck for the formulae.\n\n4\n\nResults of one zero textures\n\nIn this section, we present the results of our numerical analysis for the four possible independent textures\nbased upon the approach described in the previous section. We give the coefficients A\u2032 s (Eq. 28) defining\neach texture, and we produce also, in order to get some interpretation of the numerical results, the\nanalytical expressions of the mass ratios up to leading order in sz , except in the last texture (M11 = 0)\nwhere we give the full analytical expressions of the mass ratios and other experimental parameters. We\nemphasize here that our numerical analysis is based on the exact formulae and not on the approximate\nones.\nThe large number of correlation figures is organized in plots, at the 3-\u03c3-error level, by dividing each\nfigure into left and right panels (halves) denoted accordingly by the letters L and R. Additional labels\n(D,N and I) are attached to the plots to indicate the type of hierarchy (Degenerate, Normal and Inverted,\nrespectively). Any missing label D, N or I on the figures of certain texture means the absence of the\ncorresponding hierarchy type in this texture.\nTables (2) and (3) list, for the three types of hierarchy and the three precision levels, the extremum\nvalues that the different parameters can take. The corresponding ranges should get larger with higher-\u03c3\nprecision levels. However, as in [21], these bounds are evaluated by spanning the parameter space with\nsome given number (of order (108 \u2212 109)) of points chosen randomly in the parameter space. This way of\nrandom spanning is more efficient than a regular meshing with nested loops where we need, with a fixed\nstep of 'modest' order of 1 degree, and one hundred points to cover the \u03b4m2 range, around 1012 points so\nthat to cover the experimentally allowed space, and so requires, in order to be efficient, a 'dynamic' step\nfor a finer meshing in the regions full of accepted points compensated by less spanning in the disallowed\n\n7\n\n\fregions. We do not have this problem with the random spanning. Moreover, the randomness of our\nspanning allowed us to check the stability of our results for different randomly chosen points when we\nran the programs several times. Thus, the values in the tables are meant to give only a strong qualitative\nindication.\n\n4.1\n\nPattern of vanishing M\u03bd 33\n\nIn this pattern, the relevant expressions for A1 , A2 and A3 are\nA1\n\n=\n\n(\u2212cx cy sz + sx sy e\u2212i \u03b4 )2 ,\n\nA2\n\n=\n\n(sx cy sz + cx sy e\u2212i \u03b4 )2 ,\n\nA3\n\n=\n\nc2y c2z ,\n\n(35)\n\nleading to\nm1\nm3\nm2\nm3\n\n\u2248\n\u2248\n\ns2\u03c3\u22122\u03b4\n+ O (sz )\ns2x t2y s2\u03c1\u22122\u03c3\ns2\u03b4\u22122\u03c1\n+ O (sz )\n2\ncx t2y s2\u03c1\u22122\u03c3\n\n(36)\n\nIn Figure 1, left and right panels, we present all the possible fifteen pair correlations related to the\nthree mixing angles and the three Majorana and Dirac phases (\u03b8x , \u03b8y , \u03b8z , \u03b4, \u03c1, \u03c3), while the last plot in\nm2\nthe right panel is reserved for the correlation of (m23 \u2261 m3\n) against \u03b8y .\nThe left panel of Figure 2 presents five correlations of J against (\u03b8z , \u03b4, \u03c3, \u03c1 and LNM) and the\ncorrelation of \u03c1 versus LNM. As to the right panel of this figure, it presents the correlations of hmiee\nagainst \u03b8x , \u03b8z , \u03c1, \u03c3, LNM, and J.\nm2\n2\nAs to Figure 3, and in a similar way, it presents the correlation of m3 against m\nm3 and m1 for the three\ntypes of hierarchy. In all we have thirty types of correlations for each hierarchy type.\nWe see in Figure 1 (plots: a-L \u2192 c-L, as examples) that all the experimentally allowed ranges of mixing\nangles, at 3\u03c3 error levels, can be covered in this pattern except for normal and degenerate hierarchy types\nwhere \u03b8y is restricted to be greater than 490 (400 ) for normal and (degenerate) ones. This restriction on\n\u03b8y is a characteristic of the normal hierarchy type in this pattern. As to the Dirac CP-phase \u03b4, it is not\nrestricted at all as evident from the same plots. Likewise, the plots (g-L, h-L), in Figure 1 show that the\nMajorana phases (\u03c1, \u03c3) are not constrained either.\nThe plots in Figure 1 show no obvious clear correlation except those concerning correlations among\nphases. The plots (d-L, e-L) show a strong linear correlation of \u03b4 versus (\u03c1, \u03c3) in the case of degenerate\nand normal hierarchy, whereas the inverted case does not reveal such a linearity. We see also also in\n(plot e-R), a linear correlation between the Majorona phases (\u03c1, \u03c3), which is rather obvious in the normal\nhierarchy type while quite blurred in the degenerate and inverted cases. As to the correlation of m23\nagainst \u03b8y , the plot (h-D,R) shows that m2 is greater than m3 provided that the angle \u03b8y is in the first\noctant for the degenerate hierarchy type.\nThe correlations (J, \u03b8z ) and (J, \u03b4) have each a specific geometrical shape regardless of the hierarchy\ntype as can be seen from Figure 2 (plots: a-L ,b-L). In fact, from Eq. (23) we can see the correlation\n(J, \u03b4) as a superposition of many sinusoidal graphs in \u03b4 whose 'positive' amplitudes are determined by the\nacceptable mixing angles, whereas the (J, \u03b8z ) correlation can be seen as being formed by the superposition\nof straight-lines in sz \u223c \u03b8z , for small \u03b8z , whose slopes can be positive or negative depending on the sign\nof s\u03b4 . The resulting shape for (J, \u03b8z ) correlation is trapezoidal instead of isosceles due to the exclusion of\nzero and its neighborhood for \u03b8z according to the latest oscillation data.\nThe left panel of Figure 2 (plots: c-L, d-L), reveals a correlation of J versus (\u03c1, \u03c3) which is a direct\nconsequence of the 'linear' correlations of \u03b4 against (\u03c1, \u03c3) and of the 'geometrical' correlation of (J, \u03b4).\nThe two correlations concerning the LNM (plots: e-L, f-L) disclose that as the LNM increases the\nparameter space becomes more restricted. This seems to be a general trend in all the patterns, where\nthe LNM can reach in the degenerate case values higher than the other hierarchies.\nThe correlations of hmiee against (\u03b8x , \u03b8z , \u03c1, \u03c3, LNM, J), as inferred from the right panel of Figure 2,\nshow that the increase of hmiee would generally constrain the allowed parameter space. We note also a\ngeneral tendency of increasing hmiee with increasing LNM in all cases of hierarchy (plots e-R). Another\n8\n\n\fFigure 1:\n\nPattern M\u03bd 33 = 0 : The left panel (the left three columns) presents correlations of \u03b4 against mixing angles\n\nand Majorana phases (\u03c1 and \u03c3) and those of \u03b8x against \u03b8y , \u03c1 and \u03c3. The right panel (the right three columns) shows the\ncorrelations of \u03b8z against \u03b8y , \u03c1 , \u03c3, and \u03b8x and those of \u03c1 against \u03c3 and \u03b8y , and also the correlation of \u03b8y versus \u03c3 and m23 .\n\n9\n\n\fFigure 2:\n\nPattern M\u03bd 33 = 0 : Left panel presents correlations of J against \u03b8z , \u03b4, \u03c3 , \u03c1, and lowest neutrino mass (LNM),\n\nwhile the last one depicts the correlation of LNM against \u03c1. The right panel shows correlations of mee against \u03b8x , \u03b8z , \u03c1, \u03c3,\nLNM and J.\n\nFigure 3:\n\nPattern M\u03bd 33 = 0 : correlations of mass ratios\n\n10\n\nm2\nm3\n\nand\n\nm2\nm1\n\nagainst m3 .\n\n\fpoint concerning hmiee is that it can not attain the zero-limit in all types of hierarchy, as is evident from\nthe graphs or explicitly from the corresponding covered range in Table 2.\nFor the mass spectrum, we see from Figure 3 that the normal hierarchy is of moderate type in that\nthe mass ratios do not reach extremely high, nor low, values. In contrast, the inverted hierarchy could\nbe a severe one passing to the limit of vanishing m3 . All hierarchy types are characterized by nearly\nequal values of m1 and m2 . We also see that if m3 is large enough then only the degenerate case with\nm1 \u223c m2 can be compatible with data. We shall find later in section 5 that there is a singular texture,\nwith vanishing m3 which can accommodate the data in the inverted hierarchy case. The possibility of\nvanishing m3 could be seen from the coverable ranges of masses m3 in Table 2.

Figures (4, 5 and 6) show the corresponding correlation plots, with the same conventions as in\nthe (M\u03bd 33 = 0) case. We see that the mixing angles and phase angles can cover their experimentally\nallowed regions. The pair correlations (\u03b4, \u03c1), (\u03b4, \u03c3) and (\u03c1, \u03c3) show linear behavior in both degenerate and\ninverted cases. The 'sinusoidal' and 'trapezoidal' shapes of the (J, \u03b4) and (J, \u03b8z ) correlations are invariably\ncovered. Again, a lower bound on mee restricts enormously the parameter space. The correlation-plots\nof mee , or alternatively Table 1, show that the limit mee = 0 can not be met in either one of the two\nacceptable hierarchy types. Again, no clear correlation between (m23 , \u03b8y ), nor between \u03b8y and (\u03c1, \u03c3). As\nclear from Figure 5((c-D,L) and (c-I,L)), there is an acute correlation of J versus \u03c3, originating from the\nsharp linear correlation of \u03b4 with \u03c3 in both degenerate and inverted cases to be contrasted with the non\nacute one linking J and \u03c1 presented in Figure 5((d-D,L) and (d-I,L)). As to the LNM correlations, they\n11\n\n\fshow that it tends to have a low value, in that increasing it would reduce hugely the parameter space\n(this is illustrated in plots e-L and f-L of Figure 5 in the degenerate case, where the range of the LNM\nis larger than that in the inverted case and so a concentration of the accepted dots near a low value of\nthe LNM is more obvious). The general tendency of increasing hmiee linearly with increasing LNM in all\npossible hierarchies (plots b-R of Figure 5) can be easily recognized.\nFor the mass spectrum, the inverted hierarchy is not sharp, in that the ratio m2 /m3 has an upper\nbound of order unity -\u2248 4.5- (Figure 6, plot a-I ). We note also that no mass can approach too closely\nto zero. We see this in the inverted hierarchy either by looking at (Figure 6, plot b-I) and noting that\nm2\nm1 is not reaching very large values corresponding to very minute m1 , or by checking the coverable mass\nregions in Table 2. There is no non-invertible such texture which can accommodate the current data.\n\nFigure 4:\n\nPattern M\u03bd 32 = 0 : Left panel presents correlations of \u03b4 against mixing angles and Majorana phases (\u03c1 and \u03c3)\n\nand those of \u03b8x against \u03b8y , \u03c1 and \u03c3. while right panel shows the correlations of \u03b8z against \u03b8y , \u03c1 , \u03c3, and \u03b8x and those of \u03c1\nagainst \u03c3 and \u03b8y , and also the correlation of \u03b8y versus \u03c3 and m23 .\n\n12\n\n\fFigure 5:\n\nPattern M\u03bd 32 = 0 : Left panel presents correlations of J against \u03b8z , \u03b4, \u03c3 , \u03c1, and lowest neutrino mass (LNM),\n\nwhile the last one depicts the correlation of LNM against \u03c1.

In\ncontrast to the (M\u03bd 33 = 0) case, we see here that the mixing angles (\u03b8x , \u03b8y , \u03b8z ) can cover all their allowable\nregions (Figure 7, as examples, plots: a-L \u2192 c-L) and in all hierarchy types. The linear correlations of \u03b4\nversus \u03c1 and \u03c3 disappear in the inverted case, whereas they are replaced by Lissajous-like patterns in the\ndegenerate case (Figure 7, plots: d-L, e-L). However, there is a quasi linear correlation between \u03c1 and\n\u03c3 (Figure 7, plot: e-R) in the degenerate and inverted cases. The special 'sinusoidal' and 'trapezoidal'\nshapes of J versus \u03b4 and \u03b8z remain (Figure 8, plots: a-L, b-L), but we note that in the inverted case\nthe sinusoidal shape is severed and does not extend over the whole range of \u03b4. This would single out\nthree disallowed regions for \u03b4, one is from 00 to 40.720 and another from 1400 to 221.90 while the third\nfrom 320.810 to 3600 approximately. Again no clear correlation involves hmiee (Figure 8, right panel).\nHowever, setting a lower bound on this parameter would contract enormously the parameter space, as\ncan be seen from the upper bound of mee : (< 0.05 eV) in the normal hierarchy type, followed by (< 0.08\n14\n\n\feV) in the inverted case, and then (< 0.4 eV) in the degenerate case. Apart from the usual correlations\nof J versus \u03c1 and \u03c3 (Figure 8 plots: c-L, d-L), initiated by the correlation of \u03b4 with \u03c1 and \u03c3, the other\nplots does not show clear correlations. We see from Table 2 that the limit mee = 0 is not attainable in\nthis pattern, although a tiny value for hmiee of O(10\u22125 eV) can be achieved in the normal case. Again,\nthe general tendency of increasing hmiee with increasing LNM in all possible hierarchies (Figure 8, plots\ne-R) can be easily recognized.\nFor the mass spectrum, the plot b-I in Figure 9 tells us that the experimental data can be accommodated in the inverted hierarchy type only when the two masses m1 and m2 are approximately equal.\nHowever, the mass ratio-parameter m2 /m3 (plot a-I) indicates a strong hierarchy. Similarly, the normal\n2\ntype hierarchy case (plots a-N and b-N) reveals a strong hierarchy as shown by the mass ratios m\nm1 in\nm2\n(plot b-N), while the mass ratios m3 are of order O(1) as shown in (plot a-N). We see also that in contrast\nto the pattern of vanishing M\u03bd 33 , the limit m1 = 0 can also be reached. In fact, there is a non-invertible\nsuch texture which can accommodate the current data, and this happens when m1 = 0 or m3 = 0.\n\nFigure 7:\n\nPattern M\u03bd 13 = 0 : Left panel presents correlations of \u03b4 against mixing angles and Majorana phases (\u03c1 and \u03c3)\n\nand those of \u03b8x against \u03b8y , \u03c1 and \u03c3. while right panel shows the correlations of \u03b8z against \u03b8y , \u03c1 , \u03c3, and \u03b8x and those of \u03c1\nagainst \u03c3 and \u03b8y , and also the correlation of \u03b8y versus \u03c3 and m23 .\n\n15\n\n\fFigure 8:\n\nPattern M\u03bd 13 = 0 : Left panel presents correlations of J against \u03b8z , \u03b4, \u03c3 , \u03c1, and lowest neutrino mass (LNM),\n\nwhile the last one depicts the correlation of LNM against \u03c1.

This pattern shows only normaltype hierarchy, and the corresponding plots are shown in Figures (10). We see in this Figure (plots:\na-L, b-L and g-L) that the mixing angles (\u03b8x , \u03b8y , \u03b8z ) and the Dirac phase angle \u03b4 cover all their allowable\nregions. Figure (10, l-N,R) and Table (3) show that this texture allows a vanishing value of m1 only at the\n3-\u03c3 error level, as we shall see later when studying the singular textures. The non vanishing of m1 , at the\n1-\u03c3 and 2-\u03c3 error levels, has far reaching consequences on Majorana phases in that it excludes the tight\nregion neighborhood around \u03c3 = \u03c02 which is clearly evident from the disallowed region [89.830 , 92.460]\nfor the phase \u03c3 at the 1-\u03c3 error level as deducted from Table (3). Similarly, the non vanishing of m2\nimplies the same consequence but for \u03c1, which can be easily understood through mass ratios given in\nEq. 49 (look at the two plots: d-L, h-L). In the same way, the region of \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c3 equal to a multiple of \u03c02\nwould be excluded due to the nonvanishing\n\u0010 of m3 (look\n\u0011 at the two strips in the plot: a-R).\ns2\u03c1\nm2\nFurthermore, setting the mass ratio, m1 = s2\u03c3 t2 to be larger than 1 and taking into account that\nx\ntx is less than one, for the phenomenologically accepted \u03b8x , would force small non-vanishing lower bounds\nfor \u03c1 as can be seen in Table 2.\nPlots (c-L, h-L) show no strong correlation between (\u03b4, \u03c1), nor between (\u03b4, \u03c3), whence no clear correlation between J versus \u03c1, or between J versus \u03c3 (plots: d-R, j-R). The absence of correlation concerning\ndelta is expected since \u03b4 drops out from all expression defining the pattern. There is a strong 'kite-shaped'\ncorrelation between \u03c3 against \u03c1 (plot: a-R) showing that \u03c1 being in the first quarter forces \u03c3 to be in\nthe second quarter, and vice versa. In this pattern hmiee , as given by Eq. (21), vanishes as a direct\nconsequence of the relation defining the pattern, namely M\u03bd 11 = 0. The vanishing of hmiee clearly leaves\nits imprint on all resulting correlation through its functional dependence on mixing and phase angles as\ngiven in Eq. (52). The LNM correlation with \u03c1 (plot k-R) again excludes the region around \u03c1 = \u03c02 .\nThe mass spectrum in (plot: f-R) shows a strong normal hierarchy with m2 quite larger than m1\n(plot: l-R) and we can approach the limit m1 = 0. The singular limit (m1 = 0) is absent at the 1-\u03c3 and\n2-\u03c3 error levels as evident from Table (3).\n\n20\n\n\fFigure 10:\n\nPattern M\u03bd 11 = 0 : Left panel (the left two columns) presents all pair correlations concerning mixing angles\n\nand CP-phases except those of (\u03c3, \u03c1), (\u03c3, \u03b8y )and (\u03c1, \u03b8y ). while right panel (right two columns) displays the previously\nexcluded ones besides (m23 =\n\nm2\n, \u03b8y )\nm3\n\ncorrelation and those of J against \u03b8z ,\u03b4, \u03c3, an \u03c1 besides those of lowest neutrino\n\nmass (LNM) against \u03c1 and J. finally those of m3 against\n\n5\n\nm2\nm3\n\nand\n\nm2\n.\nm1\n\nSingular patterns\n\nThe viable singular patterns can be respectively divided into two classes, the first class is characterized\nby vanishing m1 while the second class is defined by letting m3 equal to zero. Table 4 is the analog of\nTables ( 2, 3) for the experimentally acceptable singular patterns.\n\n5.1\n\nVanishing m1 singular patterns\n\nWe have the following normal-hierarchy mass spectrum\nr\n\u221a\n\u03b4m2 \u221a\n2\nm1 = 0, m2 = \u03b4m , m3 = \u2206m2 +\n\u2248 \u2206m2 ,\n2\nm2\nwhich constrains the mass ratio m\nto be\n3\ns\np\nR\u03bd\nm2\n=\n\u2248 R\u03bd ,\nR\n\u03bd\nm3\n1+ 2\n\n(54)\n\n(55)\n\nand the mass ratio value can be deduced from that of R\u03bd given in Table (1). The vanishing of m1 together\nwith imposing one zero texture implies,\nA2 m2 e2 i \u03c3 + A3 m3 = 0,\n\nleading to\nA3\nm2\n=\n,\nm3\nA2\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nA3 m3\n.\n\u03c3 = Arg \u2212\n2\nA2 m2\n21\n\n(56)\n\n(57)\n\n\fThe Majorana phase \u03c1 becomes unphysical in this class, since m1 vanishes, and can be dropped out.\nOne can use the mass constraint Eq. 55 to check the viability of the singular patterns. We find that\nwe have three unviable cases with vanishing m1 , whose inability to accommodate data can be revealed\nm2\neasily from the mass ratio formula m\n. In fact, this mass ratio for the textures M\u03bd 22 = 0 (M\u03bd 33 = 0,\n3\n\u221a\nt2\nand M\u03bd 23 = 0), up to leading order in sz , is respectively cy2 ( t21c2 and c12 ), which is larger than R\u03bd for\nx\ny x\nx\nall allowed range of \u03b8x , \u03b8y and \u03b8z . The relevant mass ratio formulae for both viable and unviable patterns\nare listed in Table 5.\n5.1.1\n\nPattern of vanishing m1 and M\u03bd 11\n\nIn this pattern the relevant mass ratio is\n\nm2\nt2\n= z2 .\nm3\nsx\n\n(58)\n\nIn this case there is no restriction on \u03b8y and \u03b4. As to the Majorana phase \u03c3, as given by Eq.57, it is\nrestricted to be \u03c02 since both of A3 and A2 are positive real (Eq. 48). Eq. 58 imposes the constraint on\nq\nt2\n\u03b8z and \u03b8x given by sz2 = 1+RR\u03bd \u03bd . This constraint can be satisfied only at the 3-\u03c3 level. The correlations\nx\n\n2\n\nin Figure 11 indicates that \u03b8z is restricted to be in a narrow range from 11.710 to 12.910, while \u03b8x is from\n30.980 to 34.690.\n\nFigure 11:\n\nPattern (M\u03bd 11 = 0, m1 = 0) : Relevant correlations concerning (\u03b8z , \u03b8x ), (J, \u03b8z ) and (J, \u03b4) at the 3-\u03c3 precision\n\nlevel.\n\n5.1.2\n\nPattern of vanishing m1 and M\u03bd 13\n\nIn this pattern the relevant mass ratio and the Majorana phase \u03c3 are given, expanded in terms of sz , as\n\u0012\n\u0013\nc \u03b4 tx s z\nm2\nsz\n1\u2212\n+ O(s3z ).\n\u2248\nm3\nty s x c x\nty\n\u03b4\n+ O(sz ).\n(59)\n\u03c3 \u2248\n2\n22\n\n\fIn this case, the mass ratio in Eq. 59 imposes a constraint on the mixing angles and phases that can\nnot be satisfied at the 1-\u03c3 error level, whereas it can be met at the other levels, and this manifests itself\nin the clear pair correlations of Figure 12 (plots: (b-N,L),(c-N,L),(e,N-L),(g,N-L), (h,N-L) and (i,N-L)).\nTable (4) reveals the restrictions on the mixing angles \u03b8z , \u03b8y and the phase \u03b4 at the various \u03c3 levels. The\nnotable constraints, at the 2-\u03c3 level, are the restriction on \u03b8z and \u03b8y to be respectively around \u03b8z \u2248 6.50\nand \u03b8y \u2248 49.50 . The valid range for \u03b4, at the 2-\u03c3 error level, is [0.0150, 86.240 ] \u222a [267.20, 3600 ] in order\nm2\nto keep m\nconsistent with Eq. (55). At the 3-\u03c3 error level, we find that only \u03b8z has the restricted\n3\nrange [4.05, 7.540], while \u03b8x , \u03b8y and \u03b4 almost cover their acceptable range. In Figure 12(c-N,L), it is clear\nthat as \u03b8z increases, the phase angle \u03b4 tends to be around 00 or 3600 and this helps in understanding\nthe resulting correlation between J and \u03b8z concentrating around a vanishing J for relatively large \u03b8z .\nThe corresponding range for \u03c3 is affected and can be determined from the \u03b4-range through the linear\ncorrelation in Eq. (59). The correlations (J, \u03b4) and (J, \u03b8z ) can be explained as before (see, for example,\nsubsection 4.1, Figure 2, plots a-L and b-L, and the interpretation therein), albeit with care regarding\nthe mentioned restricted ranges for \u03b8z and \u03b4 and their mutual correlation.\nThe linear correlation between \u03b4 and \u03c3 (Eq. 59) is clearly manifested in Figure 12(d-N,L). The correlation (J, \u03c3), in Figure 12 (plot d-N,R), can be understood to be induced by the (\u03b4, \u03c3) linear correlation and\nby the (\u03b4, J) 'sinusoidal' correlation. The correlation between hmiee and \u03c3 can be understood through\nthe relation defining hmiee in Eq. 21, which under approximation to leading order in sz reads as\n\u0012\n\u0013\np\ns2z\n2\nhmiee \u2248 m3 R\u03bd sx 1 + 2 \u221a\ncos 2 \u03c3 + O(s4z ).\n(60)\nsx R\u03bd\nThus the resulting curve can be viewed as a superposition of many sinusoidal graphs in 3-\u03c3 precision\nlevel, whose 'positive' amplitudes are determined by the acceptable mixing angles, and shifted by constant\namount. Again the correlation (hmiee , \u03b4) is implied through (\u03b4, \u03c3) correlation.\n\nFigure 12:\n\nPattern (M\u03bd 13 = 0, m1 = 0) : The left panel plots and the top plot of the right panel present all pair\n\ncorrelations concerning mixing angles and relevant CP-phases.

We have here two\n1\n2\nunviable cases M\u03bd 11 = 0, and M\u03bd 23 = 0. The corresponding mass ratios m\nm1 are respectively t2 and\nx\n\nt2x + O(sz ). Both ratio are ruled out because in the first case it is larger than 1 + R2\u03bd while for the second\nis smaller than 1 for the allowable data. We list also the relevant mass ratio formulae for both viable and\nunviable patterns in the right part of Table 5.\n5.2.1\n\nPattern of vanishing m3 and M\u03bd 13\n\nIn this pattern, we get\nm2\nm1\n\n\u2248\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u2248\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\ns2z c2\u03b4 c2x \u2212 3 s2x \u2212 c2x\nc\u03b4 sz\n1\u2212\n\u2212\n+ O(s3z ).\nty s x c x\n2c2x s2x t2y\ns\u03b4 sz\n+ O(s2z ).\n\u03c3+\n2 c x s x ty\n\n(65)\n\nIn this case, the compatibility of the mass ratio in Eq. 65 with the constraint given by Eq. (62) imposes\nrestrictions on the mixing angles and phases, which is made evident in the clear pair correlations in\nFigure 13 [plots: (a-I,L) \u2192 (e,I-L)]. The mixing angles cover all their allowed range at the 3-\u03c3 level.\nm2\ngreater than one as evident\nThe Dirac phase \u03b4 is restricted to be around \u03c02 or 32\u03c0 in order to keep m\n1\nfrom Figure 13 (plot: (c-I,L)). The restriction on \u03b4 results from an interplay between terms of various\norders namely O(sz ) and O(s2z ) which leads to the specified range [82.220, 97.390] \u222a [262.20 , 276.460]. The\ncorrelations (J, \u03b4) and (J, \u03b8z ) appearing in Figure 13 (plots:(d-I,R) and (e-I,R) respectively) can again be\nexplained as before (see subsubsection 5.1.2), but with care about the mentioned restricted range for \u03b4.\nThe linear correlation between \u03c1 and \u03c3 is clearly manifested in Figure 13(plot: (a-I,R)) and is in\nagreement with the corresponding relation in Eq. 65. The relation in Eq. 65 implies the existence of two\nlines whose intercepts with the \u03c1-axis are determined by the term of order sz with sign controlled by s\u03b4 .\nThe restricted range of \u03b4 leads to the blank strip between the two lines. The correlation between hmiee\nand \u03b8z , as depicted in Figure 13(plot: (l-I,R)), can be understood through the relation defining hmiee in\nEq. 21, which under approximation to leading order in sz reads as\n\u0001\n(66)\nhmiee \u2248 m1 1 \u2212 s2z + O(s4z ).\n\nThus the resulting curve can be viewed as a superposition of many parabolae graphs in the (hmiee , \u03b8z )\nplane. No correlation for hmiee versus \u03b8x , \u03b4, \u03c1 and \u03c3.\n24\n\n\fFigure 13:\n\nPattern (M\u03bd 13 = 0, m3 = 0) : The left panel plots and the top row plot of the right panel present all pair\n\ncorrelations concerning mixing angles and relevant CP-phases.

(67) with that given in Eq. (62) imposes a constraint on the\nmixing angles and phases, which is displayed in the clear pair correlations in Figure 14 (plots:(a-I,L) \u2192\n(e,I-L). The Dirac phase \u03b4 is restricted to be in the second and third quadrant (\u03b4 \u2208 [117.130, 241.190])\nm2\ngreater than one. This behavior can be easily demonstrated from the mass ratio formula\nto keep m\n1\nin Eq. (67) which indicates that c\u03b4 should be negative in order to enhance the leading order result,\n(t2x ), to be greater than one. As \u03b8z decreases, \u03b4 tends to be restricted around 1800 as evident from\nFigure 14(plot: (c-I,L)). The remaining mixing angles almost cover all their allowed range at the 3-\u03c3\nlevel, but as \u03b8z increases \u03b8x and \u03b8y tends to be unrestricted as evident from Figure 14 (plots: (i-I,L),\n(l-I,L)). The correlations (J, \u03b4) and (J, \u03b8z ) appearing in Figure 14 (plots:(d-I,R) and (e-I,R) respectively)\n\n25\n\n\fcan be explained as before (see subsubsection 5.1.2), paying attention to the mentioned restricted range\nfor both \u03b4 and \u03b8z and their mutual correlation.\nThe linear correlation between \u03c1 and \u03c3 is clearly manifested in Figure 14 (plot: (a-I,R)) and agrees\nwith the corresponding relation in Eq. 67 and the higher order terms O(sz ) can account for the strip\nappearance instead of a sharp line. The correlation between hmiee and \u03b8x , as depicted in Figure 14 (plot:\n(h-I,R)), can be understood through the relation defining hmiee in Eq. 21, which leads to\nhmiee \u2248 m1 cos (2 \u03b8x ) c2z ,\n\n(68)\n\nIn deriving the above equation, we took into account the relation between \u03c1 and \u03c3 as presented in Eq. 67.\nIn the allowed range for \u03b8z , the factor c2z does not vary much and thus mee can be seen depending mainly\non the variable \u03b8x . The resulting figure, Figure 14 (plot:(h-I,R), can be viewed then as a cosine curve,\nfor the allowed range of (\u03b8x , \u03b8z ), whose amplitude is modulated by the allowed value of m1 . The other\ncorrelations involving hmiee presented in Figure 14 (right panel) can be explained easily through the\nformula in Eq. (68) together with the correlations involving \u03b8x and \u03b8z with other mixing angles and\nphases.\n\nFigure 14:\n\nPattern (M\u03bd 33 = 0, m3 = 0) : The left panel and the top row plot of the right panel present all pair correlations\n\nconcerning mixing angles and relevant CP-phases.

Exact and approximate expressions for ratios are included. The status of each singular texture is indicated.\n\n\f6\n\nSymmetry realization\n\nAll neutrino mass matrices with one zero-texture can be realized in a simple way in models based on\nseesaw mechanism with a flavor Abelian symmetry. The realization method relies on the necessity of at\nleast two zeros in MR to be reflected as two zeros in M\u03bd through the seesaw relation in Eq. 1 and on\nassuming that the Dirac neutrino mass is diagonal. Relaxing this assumption, in that Dirac neutrino mass\nmatrix can take a non-diagonal form, then one sole zero in M\u03bd can be produced. The construction should\nbe augmented with three Higgs doublet with appropriate flavor symmetry transformation to generate\nnon diagonal Dirac neutrino mass matrix while keeping charged lepton mass matrix diagonal.\nWe need three right-handed neutrinos \u03bdRj , three right-handed charged leptons lRj and three lefthanded lepton doublets DLj = (\u03bdLj , lLj )T , where j is the family index. Also we need the three standard\nmodel (SM) Higgs doublets, plus other scalar singlets. We follow a similar procedure to that of [19] and\nassume a Z8 \u00d7 Z2 underlying symmetry. For the sake of illustration, let us take the case of M\u03bd 11 = 0.\nUnder the action of Z8 factor, the leptons (the right singlets and the components of left doublets) of the\nfirst, second, and third families are multiplied by (1, \u22121, \u03c9 = ei \u03c0/4 ) respectively. As to the three SM\nHiggs doublets \u03a61 , \u03a62 and \u03a63 , the first two do not change under Z8 , while the third is multiplied by \u03c9 5 .\nUnder the factor Z2 , all fields stay invariant except \u03bdRj , \u03a62 and \u03a63 which change sign.\nThe bilinears of DLi lRj and DLi \u03bdRj , relevant for Dirac mass matrix of neutrino and charged leptons\ntransform under the factor Z8 as\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 \u03c94 \u03c9\nDLi lRj \u223c\n(69)\n= DLi \u03bdRj \u223c\n= \uf8ed \u03c94 1 \u03c95 \uf8f8 .\n\u03c97 \u03c93 1\nThe assigned symmetry transformation for three Higgs doublets guarantee diagonal mass matrix for\ncharged leptons and Dirac neutrino mass matrix of the form,\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u00d7 0 0\nM\u03bd D = \uf8ed 0 \u00d7 \u00d7 \uf8f8 ,\n(70)\n0 0 \u00d7\n\nwhere the cross sign denotes a non vanishing entry.\nThe bilinears \u03bdRi \u03bdRj , relevant for the Majorana neutrino mass matrix MR , transform under the factor\nZ8 as\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 \u03c94 \u03c9\n\u03bdRi \u03bdRj \u223c\n(71)\n= \uf8ed \u03c94 1 \u03c95 \uf8f8 ,\n\u03c9 \u03c95 \u03c92\nThe (1, 1) and (2, 2) matrix elements of MR are Z8 \u00d7 Z2 invariant, hence their corresponding mass terms\nare directly present in the Lagrangian. We require a Yukawa coupling to a real scalar singlet (\u03c712 ) which\nchanges sign under the factor Z8 to generate the (1, 2) matrix element in MR , when acquiring a vacuum\nexpectation value (VEV) at the seesaw scale. The (1, 3) matrix element is equally generated by the\nYukawa coupling to a complex scalar singlet (\u03c713 ) with a multiplicative number \u03c9 7 under the factor Z8 .\nThe resulting right-handed Majorna mass matrix can be casted in the form,\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7\n(72)\nMR = \uf8ed \u00d7 \u00d7 0 \uf8f8 ,\n\u00d7 0 0\n\nThe resulting effective Majorana mass matrix of light neutrino\n\uf8eb\n0\nT\nM\u03bd = MD MR\u22121 MD\n= \uf8ed \u00d7\n\u00d7\n\ntakes the form,\n\uf8f6\n\u00d7 \u00d7\n\u00d7 \u00d7 \uf8f8.\n\u00d7 \u00d7\n\nwhich is of the required structure.\nFor the other patterns, they can be generated in a similar way summarized in the Table (6).\n29\n\n(73)\n\n\fSymmetry under Z8 factor\n\u03a63 1F 2F 3F \u03c711 \u03c712 \u03c713\n\u03c95\n1\n\u22121 \u03c9\n\u00d7\n\u22121 \u03c9 7\n\u03c9\n1\n\u22121 \u03c9\n\u00d7\n\u22121\n\u00d7\n\u03c95\n\u03c9 \u22121\n1\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u03c97\n\u03c9\n1\n\u22121 \u03c9\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u03c95\n\u03c9 \u22121\n1\n\u03c96\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u03c9\n1\n\u22121 \u03c9\n\u00d7\n\u22121\n\u00d7\nSymmetry under Z2 factor\n\u03a62 , \u03a63 , \u03bdR1 , \u03bdR2 , \u03bdR3 change sign, while the rest doesn't\n\nPattern\nM\u03bd 11 = 0\nM\u03bd 22 = 0\nM\u03bd 33 = 0\nM\u03bd 12 = 0\nM\u03bd 13 = 0\nM\u03bd 23 = 0\n\n\u03a61\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\u03a62\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\u03c722\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\n\u03c723\n\u00d7\n\u03c93\n\u22121\n\u03c93\n\u22121\n\u00d7\n\n\u03c733\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u03c96\n\u00d7\n\u03c96\n\nchange\n\nTable 6: The Z8 \u00d7 Z2 symmetry realization for six patterns of one zero texture.

As evident from the seesaw\nformula in Eq. (1), MR can not be singular; otherwise, the seesaw mechanism would not work and thus\nwe are obliged to introduce a singular neutrino Dirac mass matrix. The symmetry realization can be done\nsimilarly to the non-singular case, but we need more zeros in MD in order to make it singular. These\nfurther zeros can emerge as a result of enhancing the symmetry form Z8 \u00d7 Z2 to Z12 \u00d7 Z2 . This generic\nchoice of the group, Z12 \u00d7 Z2 was discussed in [18], and in the present work we use it to realize the case\nof singular one-zero texture models, although it might not be the most economic choice.

The other demanded scalars (singlets and doublets) and their transformation properties are\ndependent on the required singular one-zero texture. As an example, we consider the singular case of\nM\u03bd 11 = 0, and the remaining other cases can be done in a similar fashion.

The first one is that the models constructed above would display flavorchanging neutral Yukawa interactions, since various Higgs doublets provide different entries of each mass\nmatrix. However, the effects are calculable in the models and it should be possible to suppress processes,\nlike the decay \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3, by adjusting Yukawa couplings in such a way that the relevant elements of Y\u03bd\u2020 Y\u03bd\nare quite small [18, 28]. The second point concerns the stability of the zero-texture under radiative\ncorrections, where the contribution of off-diagonal elements of the neutrino Yukawa couplings to the\nrenormalization group (RG) running of the neutrino mass matrix can then replace the texture zero by a\nnon-vanishing entry. Here, again, one can avoid situations, where the RG running spoils at low energy\nthe acceptability of a zero-texture at high energy, by choosing smaller Yukawa couplings, or a smaller\nmass for the LNM, or different values for Majorana phases, all of which are not constrained strongly by\nthe data [28].\nAnother interesting possibility to realize the one-zero textures is achieved by using the type-II seesaw\nmechanism [29], where the standard model is extended by introducing several SU (2)L scalar triplets Ha ,\n(a = 1, 2, * * * N ),\n\u0003\n\u0002\n(78)\nHa \u2261 Ha++ , Ha+ , Ha0 .\n\nThe gauge invariant Yukawa interaction relevant for neutrino mass takes the form,\nLH,L =\n\n3 X\nN\nX\n\ni,j=1 a=1\n\n\u0003\n\u0001\n\u0002\nT\nT\nT\nT\nC lLj ,\nC lLj + lLj\nC \u03bdLi + Ha++ lLi\nC \u03bdLj + Ha+ \u03bdLi\nYija Ha0 \u03bdLi\n\n(79)\n\nwhere Yija are the corresponding Yaukawa coupling constants, the indices i, j are flavor ones, and C is the\ncharge conjugation matrix.\nThe field Ha0 could acquire a small expectation value, hHa0 i0 that gives rise to a Majorana neutrino\nmass matrix of the following form,\nN\nX\nM\u03bd ij =\nYija hHa0 i0 .\n(80)\na=1\n\n31\n\n\fThe smallness of the vacuum hHa0 i0 is attributed to the largeness of the triplet scalar mass scale[29].\nUsing type-II seesaw mechanism as described above, all possible one-zero textures can be generated\nby using four Higgs triplets augmented by Z5 flavor symmetry. For the purpose of illustration, the case\nof M\u03bd 11 = 0 is detailed as follows. We assume that the leptons (the right charged singlets and the\n2\u03c0\ncomponents of the left doublets) of the first, second and third families are multiplied by (1, \u03a9 = ei 5 , \u03a92 ).\nAs to the four Higgs triplets (H1 , H2 , H3 , H4 ) they are multiplied by (\u03a94 , \u03a93 , \u03a92 , \u03a9) respectively.

The transformation properties, under the specified\n2\u03c0\ngroup, is listed below each family and needed scalar triplet for each pattern. \u03a9 denotes ei 5 .\nOne can see from Tables (6, 7 and 8), that the type-II seesaw construction, compared to the corresponding\none in type-I scheme, is simpler in the sense of a minimal added particle content and a smaller Zn flavor\nsymmetry group. However there is no clear way for symmetry realization of singular Majorana mass\nmatrix in case of type-II seesaw in contrast to the type-I case presented earlier. Nonetheless, there\nare two advantages of this Type-II seesaw construction. First, the Majorana neutrino mass matrix is\nrenormalized multiplicativelly[30] and thus the zero textures are stable under renormalization effects.\nSecond, the flavor changing neutral current due to the triplet is highly suppressed due to the heaviness\nof the triplet mass scale, or equivalently the smallness of the neutrino masses.\n\n7\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\n\nTaking into account the recent oscillation data that confirms relatively large value of \u03b8z , we have presented\nan updated comprehensive phenomenological analysis for all the possible patterns of Majorana neutrino\nmass matrices with one-zero element. All the six possible cases allow to accommodate the current data\nwithout need to adjust the input parameters. For the chosen acceptable parameter points, all the matrices\nare complex displaying CP violation effects.\nNon-invertible mass matrices with one-zero texture occur only in the cases: M11 (N), M12 and M13\n(N and I), M22 and M33 (I), where the normal hierarchy (N) corresponds to m1 = 0 and the inverted\nhierarchy (I) implies m3 = 0.\n32\n\n\fAll the nonsingular textures can produce all the three types of hierarchy, except the texture M32 which\ncan not produce the normal type in contrast to the texture M11 which produces just this type. The mixing\nand phase angles cover their whole experimentally allowed regions. However, in the normal type of M33\n(M22 ), the angle \u03b8y is constrained to be larger than 49o (smaller than 41o ). Also, in the inverted type\nof M13 (M12 ), the phase \u03b4 is bound to lie inside the interval union [40.72o, 140o ] \u222a [221.9o, 320.81o] (\n[43.77o, 136o ] \u222a [223.7o, 316.82o]), and the other phase angle \u03c1 is forbidden to be around \u03c02 in the texture\nM11 .\nThere exists a linear correlation between \u03b4 and \u03c1 or \u03c3, for textures M22 and M33 in case of normal\nand degenerate hierarchies and for texture M23 in case of degenerate and inverted hierarchies. In case of\nM13 and M12 textures there is a clear correlation but is not a linear one. This induces a clear correlation\nof J against these two phases. As to the correlation (\u03c1, \u03c3), it is linear in the textures M23 ,M13 and M12\nin case of normal and degenerate hierarchies but it has a kite-like shape in case of M11 . We see also\nthat imposing a zero-texture would not in general force the parameter hmiee to take very tiny values,\nexcept for the texture M11 where it is identically zero. Another less obvious exception is the case of\nnormal hierarchy of the patterns M12 and M13 where hmiee can attain very tiny values of O(10\u22125 ) eV\nsubstantially smaller than the allowed lower bounds in the other cases.\nThese features might help in distinguishing between the four independent cases (M33 , M13 , M32 , M11 ,\nsay). If by measuring the masses we note a normal hierarchy, then M32 is excluded. We look then for\nthe hierarchy intensity (m3 /m2 ). If it is larger than 2 (in the 3-\u03c3 precision level) then the pattern M33 ,\nwhere the range of the ratio is [1.4, 1.9], is excluded. If, then, the measurement of mee gives a non-zero\nvalue then the pattern M13 (or its T-equivalent M12 ) is the only possible pattern. On the other hand,\nif m3 /m2 is less than 2 then the pattern M11 , where this mass ratio lies in [3.3, 6.2], is excluded and\nwe need to choose between the pattern M33 and the pattern M13 (where the corresponding interval is\n[1.43, 6]). If we have m3 /m2 > 2 or if \u03b8y < 49o , then M33 is excluded. Contrariwise, if m3 /m2 < 2 and\n\u03b8y > 49o , then measuring (\u03c3, \u03b4) can decide which of the two patterns fit by comparing to the 'narrow'\ndotted regions in the plots (e-N,L) of Figs.1, 7.\nHowever, if the mass spectrum corresponds to inverted hierarchy type, then the acceptable patterns\nare (M32 , M33 , M13 ). Here, if the mass ratio (m2 /m3 ) (in the 3-\u03c3 precision level) is strong (> 100)\nthen the pattern M32 is excluded since this ratio in it does not exceed the value 4.5. Moreover, the\nmeasurement of \u03b4 can exclude M13 if it lies outside [40.72o, 140o ] \u222a [221.9o , 320.81o], whereas, in the other\ncase, the narrow linear band of the correlation (\u03c1, \u03c3) in Figure 7 (plot e-I,R) can help in this exclusion.\nThis last correlation, nonetheless, does not help, when needed in the case m2 /m3 < 100, in differentiating\nbetween M32 and M33 (see the 'blurred' plots (e-I,R) in Figs. 1, 4).\nIn the degenerate case, the possible patterns are also (M32 , M33 , M13 ). Although the mere measurements of \u03b4 can not in its own exclude one of the textures, however, the knowledge of all the phase angles\njointly, and referring to the 'narrow' bands of the correlations (\u03c1, \u03c3) for the M32 , M13 cases and the linear\ncorrelations of (\u03b4, \u03c3) for M33 , M32 cases can help in deciding which texture does fit the data.\nWe note in what preceded a strong similarity with the vanishing minor analysis given in [21], in\nline with the mapping (Eq. 34) swapping inverted and normal hierarchies. However, as we indicated\nbefore, this correspondence is qualitative and can not be used to deduce the actual allowed values of the\nparameters defining the one-zero textures starting from those of the vanishing minor case, due largely to\nthe fact that the experimental bounds we have are not invariant under this mapping. Moreover, there\nare singular models for the one-zero textures which are rich in phenomenology, and which are not related\nto any model of the vanishing minor case, be it singular or not.\nAll the singular viable one-zero textures do not allow the angle \u03b8z to be vanishing, in contrast to\nthe singular vanishing one minor texture[21] which implies vanishing \u03b8z and thus becomes unviable\naccording to the recent oscillation data. There are three viable singular textures with normal-type\nhierarchy (m1 = 0): M11 , M13 , M12 . The singular texture M11 is viable only at the 3-\u03c3 level and is\ncharacterized by \u03c3 = \u03c02 and that \u03b8z \u2208 [11.71o, 12.92o], whereas \u03b8x < 34.69o. In the T1 -related normaltype singular one-zero textures M13 and M12 , the difference between 2 \u03c3 and \u03b4 is equal to zero and \u03c0\nrespectively, up to O(sz ), whereas \u03b8z < 7.8o , which helps in distinguishing them from the singular M11\npattern.\nThere are four viable singular textures with inverted-type hierarchy (m3 =0): M12 , M13 , M22 , M33 .\nIn the T1 -related inverted-type singular textures (M13 , M12 ), we have \u03c1 \u2248 \u03c3 and \u03b4 \u2208 [82.220, 97.39o] \u222a\n33\n\n\f[262.2o, 276.47o].\nThe T1 -related inverted-type singular textures (M33 , M22 ) are viable for all precision levels except at\nthe 1-\u03c3 level where M33 can be accommodated while M22 fails. The Majorana phases are constrained\nto satisfy |\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c3| \u2243 \u03c02 . As to \u03b4, it is bound to be in the 1st and 4th quadrants outside [62o , 300o ] for\nM22 , whereas in M33 it lies in the 2nd and 3rd quadrants inside the interval [117.13o, 241.19o]. Thus the\ndifference between \u03c1 and \u03c3 and the quadrants in which \u03b4 lies can help in distinguishing between the four\ninverted-type singular one-zero textures.\nIn singular textures where m1 = 0, it might be possible to attribute the smallness of \u03b8z to the smallness\nof R\u03bd through the relations in Eq. (55). This is clear in the case of (m1 = 0, M\u03bd 11 = 0) which implies\n\u221a\nt2z \u2248 R\u03bd s2x . However, this will not work in the other viable patterns of m1 = 0, because there will be a\ndependency on \u03b4 besides the mixing angles.\nAll the one-zero patterns can be realized in the framework of flavor Abelian discrete symmetry implemented in seesaw schemes. In the case of type-I scheme, the group is (Z8 \u00d7 Z2 ), and we need three\nscalar doublets, and two additional scalar singlets in the invertible patterns transforming appropriately.\nAs to the singular patterns for the neutrino mass matrix, and although they enjoy a larger symmetry\n(Z12 \u00d7 Z2 ), their realizations required more scalar fields. Actually, we needed three scalar singlets and\nat most seven scalar doublets. As to the type-II seesaw scheme, we presented alternative simple realizations based on introducing several Higgs triplets without introducing right handed neutrinos. The flavor\nsymmetry turns out to be Z5 which is simpler than those required for the case of type-I seesaw.\nFinally, and compared to preceding analyses of the one-zero textures ([16] and references therein), we\ncan summarize the new points carried out in our work as follows. First, we have updated the viability\ntesting for the textures considering the new oscillation data. Second, we have pointed out a relation\nbetween the one-zero textures and the one-vanishing-minor textures analyzed in [21] and used it to crosscheck the calculations. Third, we signaled the importance of the T1 -symmetry relating different patterns\nwith each other, and used it to check the consistency of the results in the related patterns. Fourth, and\ndue to the random sampling method we used, we could cover the whole parameter space rather than\nlimiting the study to representative points. Last, we have presented symmetry realizations theoretically\nmotivated by the seesaw mechanism.\n\nAcknowledgements\nPart of the work was done within the associate scheme and short visits program of ICTP.\nN.C. acknowledges funding provided by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.\n\nReferences\n[1] Y.
