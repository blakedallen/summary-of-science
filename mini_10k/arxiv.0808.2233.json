INTRODUCTION\n\nOne of the surprising discoveries of the Copernicus\nsatellite was the strong P-Cygnii profiles of superions,\nsuch as O VI and N V, in the FUV spectra of many O\nand B stars (Snow & Morton 1976). The only viable explanation for the presence of O VI is Auger ionization\nby X-rays from O IV (Cassinelli & Olson 1979) which\nis the dominant form of oxygen in many O-type stars.\nThe X-ray emission, necessary for Auger ionization, was\nlater detected by the first X-ray telescopes (e.g., Harnden\net al. 1979; Seward et al. 1979).\nThe origin of the stellar X-ray emission was another\nenigma until the \"wind-shock\" mechanism (Lucy &\nWhite 1980) became the accepted explanation. Massive\nstars posses strong line-driven winds in which the material is accelerated by numerous C, N, O, and Fe transitions (see e.g., Pauldrach & Puls 1990; Castor et al.\n1975). It was known from the conception of the linedriven wind theory that such flows are unstable and\nprone to the formation of dense clumps and shocks (see\ne.g., Owocki & Rybicki 1991; Lucy & White 1980). The\nlarge-scale flow energy is converted to heat in the shock\nfronts producing high temperature plasma. Numerical\nsimulations confirm (Feldmeier et al. 1997; Owocki et al.\n1988) that at least the soft X-ray emission of early-type\nstars can be explained by this mechanism.\nEvidence for density inhomogeneities (or clumped\nwinds) is provided by variability studies of both WR\nstars (L\u00e9pine & Moffat 1999, and references therein),\n1 E-mail: jaz8@pitt.edu\n2 Department of Physics\n\nand Astronomy, University of Pittsburgh, 3941 O'Hara St., Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA\n3 Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille, CNRS-Universit\u00e9 de\nProvence, 13388 Marseille cedex 13, FRANCE\n4 Department of Astronomy, University of Maryland, College\nPark, MD 20742, USA\n5 Goddard Space Flight Center, 8800 Greenbelt Road, Greenbelt, Maryland 20771, USA\n6 NASA Postdoctoral Fellow\n7 Department of Physics and Astronomy, Swarthmore College,\n500 College Ave, Swarthmore, PA 19081, USA\n\nand O stars (e.g., Eversberg et al. 1998; L\u00e9pine & Moffat 2008). Further, density inhomogeneities allow the\nelectron-scattering wings of emission lines to be reduced\nto the observed level while maintaining the strength of\nemission lines (Hillier 1991; Hamann & Koesterke 1998;\nHillier & Miller 1999). More recently, Crowther et al.\n(2002) and Hillier et al. (2003) found that they could\nnot simultaneously fit the H\u03b1 and P V \u03bb\u03bb1120 profiles\nin normal O supergiants without assuming an inhomogeneous density distribution in the wind. Using a more\nstatistical approach, Massa et al. (2003) showed that the\nphosphorus ionization structure was consistent with expectations only if lower than conventional mass-loss rates\nwere used in their analysis of P V \u03bb\u03bb1120. Additional observational evidence for wind clumping come from Chandra and XMM-Newton high-resolution X-ray spectra of\nO stars. These spectra revealed that X-ray lines suffer\nless absorption in the wind than predicted by \"smooth\"\nmodels (e.g., Kramer et al. 2003; Cohen et al. 2006; Waldron & Cassinelli 2007, and references therein).\nSuperionization has received only limited attention\nsince the work of MacFarlane et al. (1993; 1994). The effect was introduced into modern stellar atmosphere codes\n(e.g., WM-basic, Pauldrach et al. 2001), but we are unaware of any work that has revisited the question in light\nof the high-resolution X-ray observations, improved Xray emission calculations and the new results on clumping. With improvements to CMFGEN, we are developing\ntools and techniques to move towards this goal. As part\nof this effort we discovered that the interclump medium\nis crucial to explain the O VI doublet profile in \u03b6 Pup.\nIn this paper we demonstrate the effect and discuss its\nimplications. In \u00a72 we briefly describe our code, the observations we used, and our models. We present and\ndiscuss our results in \u00a73\u2013\u00a74.\n2. OBSERVATIONS, TOOLS, AND MODELS\n\nWe coadded Copernicus U1 scans for \u03b6 Pup to create\nthe observed profile in Figure 1. All but two of these\nscans were blocked U1 scans that minimize stray-light\n\n\f2\n\nZsarg\u00f3et al.\n\nas described in Rogerson et al. (1973a,b). Our data reduction (see, Zsarg\u00f3 & Hillier 2008) produced an O VI\nprofile that strongly resemble those in MacFarlane et al.\n(1993) and Morton (1976).\nWe have used XCMFGEN (Zsarg\u00f3 & Hillier 2008) to\nsolve for the ionization balance and the non-LTE level\npopulations in our stellar models. XCMFGEN is a new\nversion of CMFGEN (Hillier & Miller 1998) that can\nperform X-ray emission calculations in addition to the\noriginal CMFGEN tasks. We use APEC (Smith et al.\n2001) and its accompanying database of X-ray cross sections (APED) to calculate non-LTE level populations\nand emissivities in the X-ray emitting plasma.\nBouret et al. (2005, 2008) used CMFGEN to derive\nstellar parameters for seven O supergiants. We used their\nvalues for \u03b6 Pup to construct the models listed in Table 1.\nOur improved models specifically addressed formation of\nO VI and X-ray lines (Zsarg\u00f3 & Hillier 2008). The X-ray\nemitting plasma was distributed in the wind and its emissivity was characterized by three plasma temperatures.\nThe parametrization included a volume filling factor (fX )\nand an initial turn-on radius (R0 ), as in Owocki & Cohen\n(2001). The volume filling factor was constant beyond\nR0 and was adjusted until the prescribed LX /LBOL was\nmet (see Table 1). Note that LX is the X-ray luminosity\nattenuated by the wind and not the intrinsic luminosity.\nTo treat clumping we follow the \"volume filling factor\"\napproach where the material is compressed into a fraction\nof the available volume with void in between (see e.g.,\nHillier & Miller 1999; Hamann & Koesterke 1998). The\nratio of the volume filled with material (clumps) to the\ntotal is\nfcl (r) = f\u221e + (1 \u2212 f\u221e ) * exp(\u2212v(r)/vcl )\n\nTABLE 1\nModel Parameters (representative for \u03b6 Pup).\nPhotosphere/Wind\nR\u2217 a\nTef f\nlog g (cgs)\nL\u2217\nvturb\nv sin i\nv\u221e\n\u03b2b\n\u1e40\nf\u221e\nvcl\n\n19 R\u2299\n39,000 K\n3.6\n7.0\u00d7105 L\u2299\n12 km s\u22121\n240 km s\u22121\n2300 km s\u22121\n0.9\nSmooth Wind\nClumped Wind\n7.6\u00d710\u22126 M\u2299 yr\u22121 1.7\u00d710\u22126 M\u2299 yr\u22121\n...\n0.05\n...\n150 km s\u22121\n\nPlasma\nR0 c\nLX /LBOL\nTpl 1a\nTpl 2\nTpl 3a\n\n1.5 R\u2217\n1.5\u00d710\u22127\n4.6\u00d7106 K\n2.4\u00d7106 K\n1.7\u00d7106 K\n\nNote. - Stellar parameters are from Bouret et al.

Eq. 1 is an ad-hoc\nformula, motivated by hydrodynamical simulations, and\nprovides a smooth wind at low v(r) velocities (r \u223c R\u2217 ).\nIn our models, fX and fcl are two independent parameters despite the fact that both are referred to as\n\"filling factors\". The two should be related since both\nof them are the results of the wind instability. However,\nour understanding of the line-driven winds is too poor to\nformulate this relationship.\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nFigure 1 shows our model calculations together with\nthe Copernicus spectrum. Auger ionization produces\nstrong O VI features in the case of the smooth wind\nmodel, albeit a bit weaker than observed. A better fit can\nbe achieved by increasing the oxygen abundance and by\nassuming larger turbulent velocities near v\u221e . A detailed\nanalysis of \u03b6 Pup and the simultaneous fit to the X-ray\nand UV spectra, will be presented in Zsarg\u00f3 & Hillier\n(2008). The most important feature of Fig. 1 is the absence of an O VI profile in the clumped wind model. This\ncannot be rectified by fiddling with, for example, the oxygen abundance. Adjustments at the order of magnitude\nlevel would be necessary to produce a visible O VI profile; this indicates that something fundamental is wrong\nwith the simplified \"clumped\" model.\nThere is a simple theoretical explanation for the weak\nO VI P-Cygnii profiles in clumped models. Since the\nO VI \u03bb\u03bb1032, 1038 doublet forms only in the wind by\nredistribution of the stellar radiation, the optical depth\n\nFig. 1.- Comparison of the Copernicus observation of O VI\n\u03bb\u03bb1035 (rugged line) with those calculated by XCMFGEN for a\nsmooth wind (red), for a clumped wind model (blue), and for the\ninterclump medium (green).

Equations 6\nand 7 still give the O VI fraction and density, but these\nare the values for the dense clumps, and not means over\na Sobolev length. Thus we need to use Eqs. 2, 4, and 6,\ntogether with the assumptions of qO IV \u223c 1 and ne \u223c n\nto derive\n\u03c4O VI,cl \u223c fcl \u03c4O VI,sm\n(9)\nin a clumped wind.\nIt is clear now why clumped models fail to produce\nobservable O VI lines. The volume filling factor for \u03b6 Pup\n(fcl \u223c 0.05 at r >> R\u2217 ) decreases \u03c4O VI,cl well below\nunity. The results of our XCMFGEN simulations fully\nsupport the above calculation. Figure 2 shows the radial\noptical depth of the important UV resonance lines in our\nmodels (Table 1). The curves show what is predicted\nby Eq. 9 for small fcl ; the O VI optical depth is nearly\ntwo orders of magnitude lower than in the smooth wind\nmodel. The dense clumps, therefore, contribute little or\nnothing to the O VI profiles.\nThere are two other factors that further decrease the\nO VI optical depth, and hence adversely influence the\nmodel O VI profile. First, Bouret et al. (2008) found\nsub-solar oxygen abundances for all stars in their sample\n(a factor of five difference for \u03b6 Pup); this affects only\ncomparisons with earlier calculations. Second, the X-ray\nflux available for Auger ionization tends to decrease when\nfcl is lowered; the wind absorption is smaller, hence less\nX-ray emission is needed to meet the observed LX /LBOL .\nWhat are the implications of our failure to produce\nobservable O VI lines with clumped winds? Is the wind\nsmoother than suggested by Bouret et al. (2008)? Their\n\nfilling factor for \u03b6 Pup is not extremely low; it is very\nsimilar to those found for other O supergiants (Hillier\net al. 2003; Massa et al. 2003). Further, increasing fcl to\n0.1 or 0.2 would not solve the problem. It is more likely\nthat the use of the traditional \"filling factor\" approach\nin XCMFGEN causes the failure to produce observable\nO VI lines. Equations 8 and 9 suggest that the part of\nthe wind with the largest filling factor will be the most\nimportant at producing O VI optical depth. Thus we\nneed to consider the influence of the tenuous interclump\nmedium (ICM) on the O VI profile.\nThis is a non-trivial exercise; at least three components (dense clumps, ICM, and the hot plasma) need to\nbe treated simultaneously for a fully self-consistent solution. Fortunately, the radiation field at any radius is\nalmost independent of the ICM. Therefore, we can use\nJ\u03bd (R) from our clumped model and solve the statistical\nequilibrium equations in the ICM only. We created such\na model from the clumped model of Table 1. We scaled\n2\ndown the densities by a factor of fcl\nto simulate the ICM\nat r >> R\u2217 , and imported the radiation field from the\noriginal clumped model. We also assumed that the new\nmodel is smooth, reflecting the high volume filling fraction of the ICM. Effectively, we took the ICM component\nout of the real (clump+ICM+hot plasma) wind and built\na stand-alone model for it. Since we imported the radiation field from the clumped model, the coupling between\nthe ICM and the rest of the wind has been taken into\naccount at least in the first order.\nThe choice of density in the ICM is somewhat arbitrary, but in the absence of reliable hydrodynamical predictions it is still reasonable. There is a density contrast\nof four hundred between the dense clumps and the ICM\nat r >> R\u2217 . This means that the ICM contributes little\nto the overall mass-loss rates. If we combined the models for the ICM and clumps the total \u1e40 would be nearly\nidentical (within 5%) to that of the clumped model.\nThe result of this experiment is displayed in Figs. 1\nand 3. It is obvious from both figures that the ICM has\nsubstantial O VI optical depth and contributes a strong\nP-Cygnii profile. Our results also offer a glimpse on the\nbehavior of other lines. The C IV optical depth in the\n\n\f4\n\nZsarg\u00f3et al.\n\nFig. 3.- Same as figure 2 but the solid curves are now for the\ninterclump medium. See \u00a73 for details.\n\nICM is very low and thus most of the C IV \u03bb\u03bb1550 lines\nare produced by the clumps. The behavior of N V \u03bb\u03bb1240\nis very interesting. It appears from Fig. 3 that both the\nICM and the dense medium contribute.\nOur results warrant an investigation of the physical\nconditions in the ICM and also its role in the formation\nof UV resonance lines in different environments (e.g., low\nand high density winds). For example, what is the density contrast between the ICM and clumps? At very low\ndensities the average charge state of oxygen (and other\nspecies) may be drastically different from the one in the\ndense regions. Also, how closely does the ICM follow the\nvelocity of the clumps? Do O VI and C IV follow a different velocity structure? Further, how are the ICM and\nhot plasma related?\n\nthe interclump medium to produce observable features.\nClumped wind models that use the classical \"volume filling factor\" approach (clumps with voids in between) cannot reproduce the observed O VI profile in \u03b6 Pup. The\nrecombination of O VI is too efficient and the necessary\nfractional abundance cannot be sustained in the clumps.\nHowever, a tenuous interclump medium can contribute\nenough O VI to produce an observable O VI profile. Only\na small amount of mass is necessary in the interclump\nmedium, so its overall effect on the derived mass-loss\nrates is negligible.\nOur result highlights the need for improved treatment\nof clumping in the winds of massive stars. It is impossible to achieve a simultaneous fit to all UV P-Cygnii\nprofiles with a single component wind model for \u03b6 Pup.\nOur simulations suggest that in \u03b6 Pup, different UV resonance lines probe different density regimes. C IV is\nformed almost exclusively in the dense material, while\nO VI likely originates from the interclump medium. N V\nis an intermediate case with similar contributions from\nboth components. In cooler O stars, when N2+ become\nthe dominant ionization stage, we might expect that N V\nshows the same behavior as O VI in the hotter stars. Obviously other possible effects of the interclump medium,\nin both O and W-R stars, should be investigated.\nThis research was supported by STScI grant HST-AR10693.02 and by SAO grant TM6-7003X.
