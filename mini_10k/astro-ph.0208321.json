We have analysed high resolution adaptive optics (AO) science demonstration data of the young, massive\nstellar cluster Arches near the Galactic Center, obtained with the Gemini North telescope in combination with\nthe University of Hawai'i AO system Hokupa'a. The AO H and K' photometry is calibrated using HST/NICMOS\nobservations in the equivalent filters F160W and F205W obtained by Figer et al. (1999). The calibration procedure\nallows a detailed comparison of the ground-based adaptive optics observations against diffraction limited spacebased photometry. The spatial resolution as well as the overall signal-to-noise ratio of the Gemini/Hokupa'a data\nis comparable to the HST/NICMOS data. The low Strehl ratio of only a few percent is the dominant limiting\nfactor in the Gemini AO science demonstration data as opposed to space-based observations. After a thorough\ntechnical comparison, the Gemini and HST data are used in combination to study the spatial distribution of\nstellar masses in the Arches cluster. Arches is one of the densest young clusters known in the Milky Way, with\na central density of \u223c 3 * 105 M\u2299 pc\u22123 and a total mass of about 104 M\u2299 . A strong colour gradient is observed\nover the cluster field. The visual extinction increases by \u2206AV \u223c 10 mag over a distance of 15\u2032\u2032 from the cluster\ncore. Extinction maps reveal a low-extinction cavity in the densest parts of Arches (R \u2264 5\u2032\u2032 ), indicating the\ndepletion of dust due to stellar winds or photo-evaporation. We correct for the change in extinction over the field\nand show that the slope of the mass function is strongly influenced by the effects of differential extinction. We\nobtain present-day mass function slopes of \u0393 \u223c \u22120.8 \u00b1 0.2 in the mass range 6 < M < 65 M\u2299 from both data\nsets. The spatial analysis reveals a steepening of the mass function slope from close to zero in the cluster center\nto \u0393 \u223c \u22121.7 \u00b1 0.7 at R > 10\u2032\u2032 , in accordance with a Salpeter slope (\u0393 = \u22121.35). The bias in the mass function\ntowards high-mass stars in the Arches center is a strong indication for mass segregation. The dynamical and\nrelaxation timescales for Arches are estimated, and possible mass segregation effects are discussed with respect\nto cluster formation models.\nKey words.

Introduction\nThe Galactic Center (GC) is the most extreme star forming environment within the Milky Way. High stellar and\ngas densities, turbulent motion, tidal torques exerted by\nthe steep gravitational potential, magnetic fields and an\nintense radiation field determine the physical environment\nof star formation in the GC region. Although disruptive\nforces exerted by the gravitational and radiation fields\nSend\noffprint\nrequests\nto:\nA.\nStolte,\ne-mail:\nstolte@mpia-hd.mpg.de\n\u22c6\nBased on observations obtained with the Gemini North\nTelescope and the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope.\n\ncounteract the agglomeration of material, the high gas and\ndust densities cause star formation in the GC environment\nto be most efficient. In particular, the formation of high\nmass stars and massive clusters is more successful than in\nany other region of the Milky Way.\nA detailed study of star formation processes and the\nstellar content of the GC region has until recently been\nlimited to the brightest and most massive stars due to\nthe large amount of extinction (AV \u223c 30 mag) along\nthe line of sight. Additional constraints are imposed due\nto the spatial resolution at the GC distance of \u223c 8 kpc\n(DM = 14.47 \u00b1 0.08 mag, e.g., McNamara et al. 2000),\n\n\f2\n\nA. Stolte et al.: Mass Function of the Arches Cluster\n\nmuch farther than nearby star forming regions such as\nthe Orion or \u03c1 Ophiuchi star forming complexes, which\nhave been studied in greater detail to date. Only with the\nadvent of deep, high resolution near-infrared instruments,\nthe analysis of stellar populations in young star clusters\nnear the GC has become feasible.\nDuring the past few years, it has become evident that\nthree out of four young starburst clusters known in the\nMilky Way are located in the GC region - namely, the\nArches and Quintuplet clusters, as well as the Galactic\nCenter Cluster itself. With a cluster age of only a few\nMyr for Arches and Quintuplet, the question arises how\nmany clusters do actually form in the densest environment\nof the Milky Way. The 2MASS database yielded new insights into the estimated number of star clusters hidden in\nthe dense stellar background. Dutra & Bica (2000, 2001)\nreport the detection of new cluster candidates of various\nages located in the innermost 200 pc of the Galaxy found\nin 2MASS. Numerical simulations by Portegies Zwart et\nal. (2001) suggest that clusters with properties similar to\nthe massive Arches and Quintuplet may have formed in\nthe past in the innermost 200 pc, but were then dispersed\nand are now indistinguishable from the dense stellar background. As dynamical evolution timescales are short due\nto the strong tidal field in the GC region (Kim et al. 1999),\nyoung star clusters are disrupted quickly after formation,\ncontributing to the Galactic bulge population. Thus, only\nthe youngest clusters remain intact for the study of star\nformation in this extraordinary environment.\nThe Arches cluster, at a projected distance of only 25\npc from the GC (assuming a heliocentric distance of 8\nkpc to the GC), is one of the most massive young clusters\nknown in the Milky Way. With an estimated mass of about\n104 M\u2299 and a central density of 3 * 105 M\u2299 pc\u22123 , Arches\nis the densest young star cluster (YC) known (Figer et al.\n1999). From physical properties of Wolf-Rayet stars, the\nage of the cluster is estimated to be between 2 and 4.5\nMyr (Blum et al. 2001). The stellar content of Arches has\nbeen studied by Figer et al. (1999) using HST/NICMOS\ndata. They derived a shallow initial mass function in the\nrange 6 < M < 120 M\u2299 with a slope of \u0393 = \u22120.7 \u00b1 0.1, but\nwith significant flattening observed in the innermost part\nof the cluster (\u0393 = \u22120.1 \u00b1 0.2).\nMost young star clusters and associations in the Milky\nWay display a mass function close to a Salpeter (1955)\npower law with a slope of \u0393 = \u22121.35. Several such\nstar forming regions have been studied by Massey et al.\n(1995a), yielding slopes in the range \u22120.7 < \u0393 < \u22121.7\nwith an average of \u22121.1 \u00b1 0.1, which leads these authors\nto conclude that within the statistical limits no deviation\nfrom a Salpeter slope is observed.\nA flat mass function as observed in Arches implies an\noverpopulation of the high-mass end as compared to \"normal\" clusters. The special physical conditions in the GC\nregion have been suggested to enhance the formation of\nmassive stars, thereby resulting in a flattened mass function (Morris 1993). The formation of high-mass stars in\nitself poses serious problems for the standard core col-\n\nlapse and subsequent accretion model, as radiation pressure from the growing star is capable of reversing the gas\ninfall as soon as the mass is in excess of 10 M\u2299 (Yorke &\nKr\u00fcgel 1977). Assuming disk accretion instead of spherical infall, the limiting mass may be increased to 15 M\u2299\n(Behrend & Maeder 2001), still far below the mass observed in O-type stars. Various scenarios are suggested to\ncircumvent this problem. Simulations with enhanced accretion rates and collision probabilities in dense cluster\ncenters (Bonnell et al. 1998), as well as growing accretion\nrates depending on the mass of the accreting protostar\n(Behrend & Maeder 2001), allow stars of up to 100 M\u2299 to\nform in the densest regions of a rich star cluster. In case\nof the GC environment, a higher gas density may lead\nto a higher accretion rate and/or to a longer accretion\nprocess in the protostellar phase. As long as the gravitational potential is strongly influenced by the amount\nof gas associated with the cluster, gas infall causes a decrease in cluster radius and subsequent increase in the\ncollision rate, reinforcing the formation of high-mass stars.\nPhysical processes such as gravitational collapse or cloud\n\u221a\ncollisions scale with the square root of the local density, \u03c1\n(Elmegreen 1999, 2001), causing an enhanced star formation rate (SFR) in high density environments. Elmegreen\n(2001) shows that the total mass as well as the maximum\nstellar mass in a cluster strongly depends on the SFR and\nlocal density. This is confirmed by observations of highmass stars found predominantly in the largest star forming\nclouds (Larson 1982).\nBoth the growing accretion and the collision scenario\npredict the high-mass stars to form in the densest central\nregion of a cluster, leading to primordial mass segregation,\nwhich may be evidenced in a flat mass function in the\ndense cluster center. As an additional physical constraint,\nboth scenarios require the lower-mass stars to form first,\nand the highest-mass stars last in the cluster evolution\nprocess. As the strong UV-radiation field originating from\nhydrogen ignition in high-mass stars expells the remaining\ngas from the cluster center, the accretion process should\nbe halted immediately after high-mass star formation.\nThe short dynamical timescales of compact clusters\nare, however, influencing the spatial distribution of stellar masses as well. On the one hand, high-mass stars are\ndragged into the cluster center due to the gravitational potential of the young cluster. On the other hand, low-mass\nstars may easily be flung out of the cluster due to interaction processes, especially given star densities as high as\nin the Arches cluster. The result of these processes would\nalso be a flat mass function in the cluster center, steepening as one progresses outwards due to dynamical mass\nsegregation. Dynamical segregation is predicted to occur\nwithin one relaxation time (Bonnell & Davies 1998), which\nfor compact clusters is only one to a few Myr, and should\nthus be well observable in Arches in the form of a spatially\nvarying mass function.\nIn addition to the internal segregation process, the external GC tidal field exerts shear forces tearing apart the\ncluster entity. N-body simulations by Kim et al. (2000)\n\n\fA. Stolte et al.: Mass Function of the Arches Cluster\n\nyield tidal disruption timescales as short as 10 to 20 Myr\nin the GC tidal field. We expect to find a mixture of all\nthese effects in the Arches cluster.\nWe have analysed adaptive optics (AO) data obtained under excellent seeing conditions with the Gemini\nNorth 8m telescope in combination with the University\nof Hawai'i (UH) AO system Hokupa'a. We are investigating the presence of radial variations in the mass distribution within the Arches cluster. We compare our groundbased results in detail to the HST/NICMOS data presented in Figer et al. (1999, hereafter FKM), discussing\npossible achievements and limitations of ground-based,\nhigh-resolution adaptive optics versus space-based deep\nNIR photometry.\nIn Section 2, we will introduce the data and describe\nthe reduction and calibration processes. In this context,\na thorough investigation of the quality of ground-based\nadaptive optics photometry as compared to space-based\ndiffraction limited observations will be presented. The\nphotometric results derived from colour-magnitude diagrams and extinction maps will be discussed in Section\n3. A comparison of Gemini and HST luminosity functions\nwill be given in Section 4. The mass functions will be\nderived in Section 5, and their spatial variation will be\ndiscussed with respect to cluster formation scenarios. We\nwill estimate the relevant timescales for cluster evolution\nfor the Arches cluster in Section 6, and discuss the implication on the dynamical evolution of Arches. We will\nsummarise our results in Section 7.\n\n2. Observations and Data Reduction\n2.1. Gemini/Hokupa'a Data\nWe analysed H and K \u2032 images of the Arches cluster center\nobtained in the course of the Gemini science demonstration at the Gemini North 8m telescope located on Mauna\nKea, Hawai'i, at an altitude of 4200 m above sea level.\nGemini is an alt-azimuth-mounted telescope with a monolithic primary mirror and small secondary mirror optimised for IR observations. The telescope is always used\nin Cassegrain configuration with instruments occupying\neither the upward looking Cassegrain port or one of three\nsideward facing ports. The University of Hawai'i adaptive\noptics (AO) system Hokupa'a is a 35 element curvature\nsensing AO system (Graves et al. 2000), which typically\ndelivers Strehl ratios between 5 % and 25 % in the Kband.\nHokupa'a is operated with the near-infrared camera\nQUIRC (Hodapp et al. 1996), equipped with a 1024\u00d71024\npixel HgCdTe array. The plate scale is 19.98 milliarcseconds per pixel, yielding a field of view (FOV) of 20.2\u2032\u2032 . The\nimages are shown in Fig. 1, along with the HST/NICMOS\nimages used for calibration.\nThe observations were carried out between July 3 and\n30, 2000. 12 individual 60 s exposures, dithered in a 4\nposition pattern with an offset of 16 pixels (0.32\u2032\u2032 ) between subsequent frames, were coadded to an H-band im-\n\n3\n\nage with a total integration time of 720 s. In K \u2032 , the set\nof 34 dithered 30 s exposures obtained under the best observing conditions was coadded to yield a total exposure\ntime of 1020 s. The full width at half maximum (FWHM)\nof the point spread function (PSF) was 9.5 pixels (0.19\u2032\u2032 )\nin H and 6.8 pixels (0.135\u2032\u2032 ) in K \u2032 . The observations were\ncarried out at an airmass of 1.5, the lowest airmass at\nwhich the Galactic Center can be observed from Hawai'i.\nThe H-band data were oversampled, and 2 \u00d7 2 binning\nwas applied to improve the effective signal-to-noise ratio\nper resolution element, allowing a more precise PSF fit.\nA combination of long and short exposures has been used\nto increase the dynamic range. For the short exposures,\n3 frames with 1 s exposure time have been coadded\nin H, and 16 such frames in K \u2032 . See Table 1 for the\nobservational details. In the long exposures, the limiting\nmagnitudes were about 21 mag in H and 20 mag in\nK \u2032 . Note that the completeness limit in the crowded\nregions was significantly lower. The procedure used for\ncompleteness correction will be described in detail in\nsection 2.1.6.\n\n2.1.1. Data reduction\nThe data reduction was carried out by the Gemini data\nreduction team, F. Rigaut, T. Davidge, R. Blum, and A.\nCotera. The procedure as outlined in the science demonstration report1 was as follows: Sky images, obtained after\nthe short observation period when the Galactic Center was\nin culmination, were averaged using median clipping for\nstar rejection, and then subtracted from the individual images. The frames were then flatfielded and corrected for\nbad pixels and cosmic ray hits. After inspecting the individual frames with respect to signal-to-noise ratio and\nresolution, and background adjustment, the images with\nsufficient quality were combined using sigma clipped averaging. The final images were scaled to counts per second.\nFor the analysis presented in this paper, this set of images\nreduced by the Gemini reduction team has been used.\n\n2.1.2. Photometry\nThe photometry was performed using the IRAF2 (Tody\n1993) DAOPHOT implementation (Stetson 1987).

While\nin H the PSF radius increases significantly with distance\nfrom the guide star, with a radially varying FWHM in\nthe range of 0.18\u2032\u2032 to 0.23\u2032\u2032 (see the science demonstration\ndata description), the K \u2032 PSF was nearly constant over\nthe field (0.125\u2032\u2032 to 0.135\u2032\u2032). This behaviour is expected\nfrom an AO system, as the isoplanatic angle4 \u03b80 varies\nas \u03bb6/5 , yielding a 1.4 times larger \u03b80 in K \u2032 than in H,\nresulting in a more uniform PSF in K \u2032 across the field of\nview.\nAs obscuration due to extinction decreases with increasing wavelength, many more stars are detected in K \u2032\nthan in H. For comparison, the number of objects found\nwith K \u2032 < 20 mag and uncertainty \u03c3K \u2032 < 0.2 mag was\n1017 (1020 s effective exposure time), while for H < 20\nmag and \u03c3H < 0.2 mag we detected only 391 objects (720\ns effective exposure time), where in both cases visual inspection led to the conclusion that objects with photometric uncertainties below 0.2 mag were real detections.\nOn the other hand, the increased stellar number density\nin K \u2032 leads to increased crowding effects, such that we\ndecided to use a non-variable PSF for the K \u2032 -band data\nafter thorough investigation of the results of a quadratically, linearly or non-varying PSF. It turns out that, due\nto a lack of isolated stars for the determination of the\nPSF variation across the field, the mean uncertainty is\nlower and the number of outliers with unacceptably large\n3\n\nThe anisoplanatism describes the degradation of the AO\ncorrection due to differences between wave fronts coming from\ndifferent directions.\n4\nThe isoplanatic angle is defined as the angular distance for\nwhich the rms error of the wave front is less than 1 radian.\n\nuncertainties reduced when a non-variable PSF is used.\nThus, the 5 most isolated stars on the K \u2032 image, which\nwere well spread out over the field, were used to derive\nthe median averaged PSF of the long exposure. In the\ncase of the short exposure, where due to the very short\nintegration time faint stars are indistinguishable from the\nbackground, leaving more 'uncrowded' stars to derive the\nshape of the PSF, 7 isolated stars could be used. In K \u2032 ,\nthe best fitting function was an elliptical Moffat-function\nwith \u03b2 = 2.5.\nDue to the lower detection rate on the H-band image\ncrowding is less severe, while the PSF exhibits more pronounced spatial variations than in K \u2032 . We thus used the\nquadratically variable option of the DAOPHOT psf and\nallstar tasks for our H-band images, with 27 stars to determine a median averaged PSF function and residuals.\nThe best fitting function was a Lorentz function on the\nbinned H-band image. In both filters, the average FWHM\nof the data has been used as the PSF fitting radius, i.e.,\nthe kernel of the best-fitting PSF function, to derive PSF\nmagnitudes of the stars.\nThe short exposures have been used to obtain photometry of the brightest stars, which are saturated in\nthe long exposures. The photometry of the long and\nshort exposures agreed well after atmospheric extinction\ncorrection in the form of a constant offset had been\napplied. The saturation limit was 13.0 mag in H and 13.3\nmag in K \u2032 . At fainter magnitudes, the photometry of both\nimages was indiscernible within the uncertainties for the\nbright stars, and the better quality long exposure values\nwere used. Furthermore, a comparison of the bright\nstar photometries was used to estimate photometric\n\n\fA. Stolte et al.: Mass Function of the Arches Cluster\n\n5\n\nFig. 2.

Photometric Calibration\nTo transform instrumental into apparent magnitudes, we\nused the HST/NICMOS photometry of Figer et al. (1999)\nas local standards. The advantage of this procedure lies\nin the possibility to correct for remaining PSF deviations\nover the field, e.g., due to a change in the Strehl ratio\nwith distance from the guide star or due to the increased\nbackground from bright star halos in the cluster center.\nIndeed, as will be discussed below, the spatial distribution\nof photometric residuals shows a mixture of these effects.\nWe were able to use approximately 380 stars to derive colour equations. The residuals obtained for these\nstars after calibration allow a detailed analysis and correction of field variations. The colour equations to transform Gemini instrumental H and K \u2032 magnitudes to magnitudes in the HST/NICMOS filter system were determined using the IRAF PHOTCAL package, yielding:\nm160 = Hinst + 0.001(\u00b10.017) * (H \u2212 K \u2032 )inst\n\u22120.028(\u00b10.031) mag\n\u2032\nm205 = Kinst\n+ 0.023(\u00b10.008) * (H \u2212 K \u2032 )inst\n\n\u22121.481(\u00b10.016) mag,\n\u2032\nwhere Hinst and Kinst\nare the Gemini instrumental magnitudes, and m160 and m205 correspond to magnitudes\nobtained with the NICMOS broadband filters F160W and\nF205W, respectively. After the transformation had been\n\napplied, it turned out that the residual magnitudes in the\ntwo independent fitting parameters H \u2212 K \u2032 and K \u2032 still\nvaried systematically over the field. As can be seen in Fig.\n3, the variation is not a simple radial variation increasing\nwith distance from the guide star (GS), but a mixture of\ndisplacement from the GS position (shown in the contour\nmap in Fig. 3 as a cross), and the position with respect to\nthe cluster center or bright stars in the field. Fortunately,\nthe variation was well behaved in the Y -direction, and\ncould be fitted by a fourth order polynomial. Close inspection showed that two areas on the QUIRC array showed a\nremaining photometric offset compared to the HST photometry. In the region 400 < X < 700 pixels and Y < 250\npixels, the magnitude was underestimated by 0.1 mag. For\nX > 850 pixels and Y > 850 pixels, i.e., the upper right\ncorner, the K \u2032 magnitude was overestimated by 0.25 mag\n(however, note that there are only 7 stars in this region).\nFor a discussion of these effects, see Sect. 2.1.4. We corrected for these offsets before deriving the Y -correction,\nwhich then showed remarkable homogeneity over the entire field. This smooth correction function is probably due\nto discrepancies in the dome flat field illumination versus\nsky exposures. The correction was then applied to trans\u2032\nformed K \u2032 and H \u2212 K \u2032 magnitudes, denoted Ktrans\nand\n\u2032\n(H \u2212 K )trans from now on. The Htrans magnitude was\n\u2032\ncalculated from the corrected Ktrans\nand (H \u2212 K \u2032 )trans\nvalues.\nAn additional advantage of this procedure is the\nindependence on uncertainties in colour transformations\nat large reddening and non-main sequence colours, as\nopposed to colour transformations derived from typical\nmain sequence standard stars. Using the HST photometry\nas local standards, we are naturally in equal colour and\n\n\f6\n\nA. Stolte et al.: Mass Function of the Arches Cluster\n\nFig. 3.

For most parts\nof the paper, we remain in the HST/NICMOS system.\nWe use the colour equations obtained in Brandner et\nal. (2001, hereafter BGB) to transform typical main\nsequence colours and theoretical isochrone magnitudes\ninto the HST/NICMOS system where indicated. This\nallows us to transform mainly unreddened main-sequence\nstars, for which the BGB colour transformations have\nbeen established. The only exceptions are the two-colour\n\ndiagram (Sect. 3.4) and the derivation of the extinction\nvariation from colour gradients (Sect. 3.1), where the\nextinction law is needed to determine the reddening\npath. We will use the notation \"m160\" and \"m205\" as in\nFKM for magnitudes in the HST/NICMOS filters, and\n\u2032\n\"Htrans \" and \"Ktrans\n\" for the Gemini/Hokupa'a data\ncalibrated to the NICMOS photometric system.

Discussion of the residual maps\nThe behaviour of the residual of the HST/NICMOS vs.\nGemini magnitudes, mNICMOS \u2212mGemini,trans, can be analysed in more detail when studying the residual map and\nthe smoothed contour plot. In (Fig. 3), positive (negative)\nresiduals correspond to overestimated (underestimated)\nflux. From the map we denote a general tendency to overestimate the flux. The contour maps show that positive\nresiduals are correlated with the position of bright stars\non the K \u2032 image, both in the crowded cluster center as well\nas in the area to the lower left, where a band of bright stars\nis located (see Fig. 1). This is the area where the K \u2032 magnitudes were found to be underestimated in Sect. 2.1.3,\nand thus the flux overestimated. This suggests that the\nincreased background due to the uncompensated seeing\nhalos of bright stars (cf. Sect. 2.1.5), inherent to AO observations, causes an overestimation of the flux of bright\n<\n(K \u2032 \u223c 13 mag)) sources. On the other hand, points with\nnegative residuals are mainly correlated with fainter stars\n>\n(K \u223c 16 mag), suggesting that this enhanced background\nleads to an oversubtraction of the individually calculated\nbackground of nearby fainter stars. The result is an underestimate of the flux of companion stars in the vicinity of bright stars. The correlation of positive residuals\nwith the position of bright stars seems to be less pronounced in the H-band image (Fig. 3). In H, the distance\nfrom the guide star is supposed to be more important\ndue to the smaller size of the isoplanatic angle at shorter\nwavelengths and consequently more pronounced anisoplanatism. Indeed, the smoothed residual contour plot shows\na symmetry in the residuals around the guide star, with\nclose-to-zero residuals in the immediate vicinity of the\nguide star, where the best adaptive optics correction can\nbe achieved. With increasing distance from the guide star,\nthe residuals increase not only towards the bright cluster,\nbut also to the west (left in Fig. 1) of the field, indicating\nthat remaining distortion effects from the AO correction\nare mixed with the problem of the proximity to bright\nstars as seen in K \u2032 .\n\n2.1.5. Strehl ratio\nThe Strehl ratio (SR) is defined to be the ratio of the\nobserved peak-to-total flux ratio to the peak-to-total flux\nratio of a perfect diffraction limited optical system. This\ndefinition allows to compare the quality and photometric\nresolution of different optical systems using a single characteristic quantity.\n\n7\n\nthe Gemini H-band 720s exposure is found to be 2.5 %\ncompared to 95 % in the HST F160W image, and 7 %\nin K \u2032 (1020s) compared to \u223c 90 % in F205W. The low\nSRs measured in the Gemini science demonstration data\nindicate that more than 90 % of the light of a star is distributed into the resolution pattern of the AO PSF and\nthe halo around each star induced by the natural seeing.\nIt has turned out that these halos cause a significant limitation to the resolution and depth of the observations in\na crowded field, as faint stars can be lost to the enhanced\nbackground in the vicinity of bright objects. When comparing the HST and Gemini luminosity functions (Sect. 4),\nthis effect causes the main difference between both data\nsets.\nIn the case of very low Strehl ratios, the SR does not\ndirectly indicate the fraction of the flux concentrated in\nthe FWHM area of the PSF. A much larger fraction of\nthe source flux can be used for PSF fitting in this case,\nalthough the spatial resolution is limited by the large\nFWHM as compared to diffraction limited observations\n(cf. Tab. 1). The ratio of the flux in the FWHM kernel of\nthe compensated stellar image to the total flux,\nF Robs = FFWHM /Ftotal ,\nmay be determined by creating curves of growth for individual stars (Stetson 1990). The larger number of nearly\nisolated stars found on the H-band image (used for PSF\ncreation) allowed a reliable determination of F Robs only\nin H, although many stars on the H-band image were still\ntoo influenced by neighbours to study the aperture curve\nof growth in detail. We were able to create well-behaved\ncurves of growth for 7 stars. As in the PSF fitting routine,\nwe have used the FWHM of the PSF as kernel radius\nand as the reference flux for the flux ratio determination.\nThese ratios range from 0.47 to 0.58, with an average of\n0.53 \u00b1 0.05, i.e., \u223c 50 % of the integrated point source\nflux are used for PSF fitting. In addition, the variation of\nthe flux ratio F Robs over the field serves as an indicator of\nthe Strehl ratio variation. If the AO correction mechanism\nis the dominant factor determining the concentration of\nthe flux into the FWHM kernel, the Strehl ratio and thus\nF Robs should decrease with distance form the guide star,\nas the seeing correction worsens. No correlation of the flux\nratio with distance from the guide star is found. Though\nthese are small number statistics, this supports the suggestion that the sensitivity variations over the field are not\npredominantly due to increasing distance from the guide\nstar (Sect. 2.1.4).\n\nSR = (Fpeak /Ftotal )obs /(Fpeak /Ftotal )theo\nwhere Fpeak is the maximum flux value of the PSF, and\nFtotal is the total flux, including the uncompensated halos\ninduced by the natural seeing. The labels obs and theo refer to the observed and the theoretically expected flux, respectively. Diffraction limited theoretical PSFs have been\ncalculated using the imgen task of the ESO data analysis package eclipse (Devillard 1997). The Strehl ratio in\n\n2.1.6. Photometric uncertainties and incompleteness\ncalculation\nFor the incompleteness correction, artificial frames\nwere created with randomly positioned artificial stars.\nMagnitudes were also assigned automatically in a random\nway. Due to the very crowded field, only 40 stars were\nadded to each artificial frame in order to avoid significant\n\n\f8\n\nA. Stolte et al.: Mass Function of the Arches Cluster\n\nFig. 4. Incompleteness tests performed on the Gemini H\nand K \u2032 data. The plot demonstrates the necessity to include the matching between single filter observations to\nobtain a realistic estimate on the incompleteness, when\nmatching of objects is needed to create colour-magnitudeand two-colour-diagrams.\n\nchanges in the stellar density. A total of 100 frames was\ncreated for both the H and K \u2032 deep exposures, leading to\na total of 4000 artificial stars used in the statistics. In addition to the individual incompleteness in each band, the\nloss of sources due to scatter of the main sequence generated by the more uncertain photometry in the dense parts\nof the cluster was estimated. For this purpose the artificial K \u2032 stars were assigned a formal instrumental 'colour'\nof (H \u2212 K \u2032 ) = 0.33 mag (corresponding to 1.745 mag\nafter photometric transformation), derived from the average observed instrumental colour of the main sequence,\nand via this transformed into instrumental H magnitudes.\nArtificial stars were inserted at the same positions in the\nH and K \u2032 frames. In this way the procedure also accounts\nfor stars lost due to the matching of H and K \u2032 data. The\nartificial stars were calibrated using the colour equations\nshown in Sect. 2.1.3 , thus allowing us to estimate the loss\nof stars in the mass function derivation due to the applied\nmain sequence colour selection (see Sect. 5). This resulted\nin significantly larger corrections as compared to the individual filter recoverage without matching and colour selection. As an example, the results for the mass function\ncalculation performed on the artificial stars are displayed\nin Fig. 4.\nAs the recovery rate depends strongly on the stellar\ndensity and thus radial distance from the cluster center,\nthe incompleteness correction will be determined in dependence of the radial bin analysed when radial variations in\nthe MF are studied (Sect. 5.3).\nIn addition to luminosity and mass function corrections, the artificial star tests were used to estimate the real\nphotometric uncertainties by comparing inserted to recovered magnitudes of the artificial stars. The median difference between the original and the recovered magnitude\nof the artificial stars, \u2206marti = <madded \u2212 mDAOPHOT >,\n\nhas been used as an estimate of the real photometric uncertainty. To obtain the median uncertainty, the intervalls\n0 < \u2206marti < 1 and \u22121 < \u2206marti < 0 have been treated\nindividually, and the mean of the absolute value of both\nmedian values, weighted with the number of objects in\neach intervall, is quoted in Tab. 2. The overall flux deviation, including positive and negative deviations, is close\nto zero for stars brighter than 20 mag (< \u00b10.004), and for\nfainter stars becomes \u22120.17 and \u22120.13 in H and K \u2032 , respectively, showing a tendency to underestimate the flux\nof faint stars. This tendency is more serious in the cluster\ncenter, where comparably large uncertainties are already\nobserved for magnitudes fainter than 18 mag in both pathbands.\nIn a second test, photometry of the bright stars in the\nshort exposures was compared to the magnitudes of the\ndeep exposures, yielding \u2206msl = <mshort \u2212 mlong> using\nthe same procedure as for artificial stars. Note, however,\nthat the quality of the short exposures is much worse than\nthe one of the long exposures due to the high background\nnoise. Therefore, the artificial star experiments, for which\nonly the deep exposures have been used, yield a more realistic estimate of the photometric uncertainties. The results\nof both tests are summarised in Table 2.\nThe resulting uncertainty is roughly a factor of 2 to 3\nlarger than the theoretical magnitude uncertainty \u03c3DAO\ndetermined from detector characteristics by DAOPHOT.\nThe photometry in the cluster center shows a larger uncertainty than the photometry in the outskirts. As expected\nin a crowding-limited field, this also implies a reduced detection probability of faint sources in the center of the\ncluster.\n\n2.2. HST/NICMOS data\nHST/NICMOS observations have been obtained in the\nthree broad-band filters F110W, F160W and F205W,\nroughly equivalent to J, H and K. The basic parameters are included in Table 1. For a detailed description of\nthe HST data and their reduction see Figer et al. (1999).\n\n3. Photometric results\n3.1. Radial colour gradient\nDuring the process of calibration we realised that a strong\ncolour gradient is present in the Arches field. In Fig. 5,\nthe H \u2212 K \u2032 colour is plotted against radial distance from\nthe cluster center. As the extinction law has not yet been\nderived for HST filters, we have used the colour transformations in BGB to transform NICMOS into 2MASS magnitudes. Though the 2MASS filters deviate slightly from\nthe standard Johnson JHK filters used to determine the\nextinction law (Rieke & Lebofsky 1985), we will be able to\nestimate the approximate amount of change in visual extinction across the field. The extinction parameters from\nRieke & Lebofsky (1985) are given by\nAJ /AV = 0.282 AH /AV = 0.175 AK /AV = 0.112,\n\n\fA. Stolte et al.: Mass Function of the Arches Cluster\n\n9\n\nTable 2. Photometric uncertainties derived from artificial star experiments (\u2206marti ) and the comparison of short and\nlong exposures (\u2206msl ). The photometric uncertainties determined by DAOPHOT are given for comparison. Note that\nfor the brightest bin, 10 - 12 mag, only the photometry of the short exposures was available.

For a\nchange in extinction of \u2206AV this leads to\n\u2206AV = \u2206(AJ \u2212 AH )/0.107\n\u2206AV = \u2206(AH \u2212 AK )/0.063\n\u2206AV = \u2206(AJ \u2212 AK )/0.170\n\nWe are able to measure the right-hand side of each expression from the transformed HST/NICMOS JHKs photometry. The resulting \u2206AV is given in each plot in Fig. 6,\ntogether with the fitting uncertainty from the rms scatter\nin the colour.\nFrom the linear fits in Fig. 6 we see that AV increases\nby about one order of magnitude over the entire field\nwhen moving outwards from the cluster center. The effect is most pronounced in the HST J \u2212 Ks vs. radius\ndiagram (Fig. 6, bottom), where the longest colour baseline is used. We derive a change in visual extinction of\n\u2206AV = 10.71 \u00b1 2.47 mag over the Gemini field (1000 pixels =\n\u02c6 0.8 pc). Notably, if only the innermost 5\u2032\u2032 (250 pixels,\n0.2 pc) are fitted, no variation in AV is observed. When\nfitting the core separately, we get \u2206AV = 0.77 \u00b1 1.12 mag\nfor R < 5\u2032\u2032 (250 pixels) versus \u2206AV = 7.87 \u00b1 2.85 mag for\n5\u2032\u2032 < R < 20\u2032\u2032 (250 < R < 1000 pixels). The latter value\ncorresponds to \u2206AV = 10.5 mag/1000 pix\u22121 , consistent\nwith the trend over the entire field. The small radial trend\nand low extinction value in the cluster center indicates the\nlocal depletion of dust. This could be either due to winds\nfrom massive stars or due to photo-evaporation of dust\ngrains caused by the intense UV-radiation field.\nA change in AV of \u223c 10 mag/1000 pix\u22121 is also\nconsistent with the result found in J \u2212 H, 8.8 \u00b1\n2.1 mag/1000 pix\u22121 , while a larger value of \u2206AV =\n14.9 \u00b1 3.2 mag is derived from the H \u2212 Ks plot. Due to\nthe uncertainties we conclude that the extinction varies\nby \u2206AV \u223c 9 \u2212 15 mag across the Arches field of 20\u2032\u2032 or\n0.8 pc, most likely closer to the lower value. This is in\n\nany case a tremendous change in the dust column density\nalong the line of sight, with strong implications on limiting\nmagnitudes and the potential detection of faint objects.\nWe have used a linear fit to the colour variation with\nradius for R > 5\u2032\u2032 to correct for the strong change in reddening observed in the outer cluster field. The values for\ncluster center stars (R < 5\u2032\u2032 ) have been left unchanged,\ndue to the large scatter and the very small trend found.\nThus, these adjusted colours are scaled to the cluster center, where AV is lowest. From the Rieke & Lebofsky (1985)\nextinction law, the change in K-band magnitude with radius corresponding to the change in colour can be derived\nas \u2206AK = 0.112/0.063 * \u2206AH\u2212K . We have used this relation to adjust the K-band magnitudes accordingly. The\n'dereddened' colour-magnitude diagrams will be shown in\ndirect comparison with the observed CMDs in Sect. 3.3\n(cf. Fig. 9).\n\n3.2. Extinction maps\nWe can calculate the individual extinction for each object by shifting it along the reddening vector onto the\nisochrone. If we assume that intrinsic reddening plays only\na minor role for most of the stars within the cluster, we can\ncombine the individual reddenings to estimate the spatial\nextinction variation. In practice, we have applied a reddening of AV = 15 mag to a 2 Myr isochrone of the Geneva set\nof models (Lejeune & Schaerer 2001). This choice of reddening ensures that the isochrone serves as a blue envelope\nfor the bulk of the cluster stars, which are significantly\nmore reddened. The choice of the isochrone will be discussed in context with the mass function (Sect. 5), where\nthe physical effects of the population model used are more\nimportant. As discussed in Grebel et al. (1996), colours of\nmain-sequence stars also depend on binarity, stellar rotation, and intrinsic infrared excess. We ignore these effects\n\n\f10\n\nA. Stolte et al.: Mass Function of the Arches Cluster\n\nFig. 5. Colour variation across the Gemini field,\nas observed in instrumental Gemini magnitudes and\nHST/NICMOS data. As a trend of increasing colour excess with increasing distance from the Arches cluster center is observed in the two independent datasets, an instrumental effect as the cause for this variation is highly\nimprobable.\n\nhere since we have no means to distinguish them from\nreddening effects. In the worst case, we will overestimate\nthe reddening for some stars. We have then shifted the\nstars along the reddening path in colour-magnitude space,\nagain assuming that the relative slopes of the extinction\nlaw approximately follow a Rieke & Lebofsky (1985) law.\nThe resulting extinction map for the Gemini photometry\nis shown in Fig. 7.\nSince the original HST/NICMOS field has twice the\narea of the Gemini central Arches field, we have also calculated the extinction map for the entire NICMOS field\nfollowing the same procedure. The corresponding map is\nshown in Fig. 8.\nThe extinction measured with this procedure in the\nK-band lies in the range 1.9 < AK < 4.1 mag, with an\naverage value of 3.1 mag, corresponding to 16 < AV < 37\nmag, <AV >= 27.7 mag. Cotera et al. (2000) derive a nearinfrared extinction of 2.8 < AK < 4.2 mag, with an average value of <AK > = 3.3 mag for 15 lines of sight towards\nseveral Galactic Center regions, corresponding to an average visual extinction of <AV > = 29.5 mag (transformed\nusing Rieke & Lebofsky (1985)). They obtain the highest extinction towards a field close to the Arches cluster,\nAV = 37.5 mag. This is very close to our highest extinction value. The average value determined from individual\ndereddening here is the same as the average extinction obtained by Figer et al. (1999), <AV > = 27.7 mag. Note that\nthe typical random scatter \u03c3(AK ) from foreground dust\ndensity fluctuations found in GC fields is linearly related\nto the average extinction within a field. The relation determined by Frogel et al. (1999) from giant branch stars in\n22 pointings towards fields within 4\u25e6 from the GC is given\nby \u03c3(AK ) = 0.056(\u00b10.005) <AK > + 0.043(\u00b10.005). This\nyields an expected natural scatter from GC clouds of only\n\nFig. 6. Colour trends over the Arches field as observed in\nthe HST/NICMOS data set within the area covered by the\nGemini observations. The radial distance from the cluster\ncenter is given in pixels on the Gemini scale. For the calculation of \u2206AV , the Rieke & Lebofsky (1985) reddening\nlaw has been assumed.\n\n\u03c3(AK ) = 0.22 mag for <AK > = 3.1 mag, much below the\ndifference in reddening observed in the Arches field. Thus,\nthe change in extinction cannot be explained by the natural fluctuations of the dust distribution in the GC region.\nComparison of the cluster center main sequence population with the main sequence colour of a theoretical 2\nMyr isochrone from the Geneva set of models (Lejeune &\nSchaerer 2001), later-on used for the derivation of the mass\nfunction, yields an average extinction of AV = 24.1 \u00b1 0.8\nmag in the cluster center. This extinction value has been\nused to transform isochrone magnitudes and colours into\nthe cluster magnitude system. It has been suggested that\nthe brightest and most massive stars in Arches are WolfRayet stars of type WN7 (Cotera et al. 1996; Blum et al.\n2001). Fundamental parameters of Wolf-Rayet stars are\ncompiled in Crowther et al. (1995). For stars of subtype\nWN7 they find typical colours of (H \u2212 K) \u223c 0.2 mag,\nleading to an extinction of AV = 24.9 \u00b1 2.4 mag with\nan observed H \u2212 K colour of \u223c 1.77 mag for the WN7\nstars, which were identified by comparison with the Blum\n\n\fA. Stolte et al.: Mass Function of the Arches Cluster\n\n11\n\net al. (2001) narrow band photometry. This value is in\nvery good agreement with the AV determined from the\nmain sequence colour in the cluster center.\n\n3.3. Colour-magnitude diagrams\nThe resulting colour-magnitude diagrams for Gemini and\nHST are presented in Fig. 9 (upper panel). Two important differences are seen when inspecting the CMDs. First,\nthe scatter in the main sequence is significantly larger in\nthe ground-based photometry. While the HST/NICMOS\nCMD reveals a narrow main sequence in the cluster center (circles in Fig. 9), the same stars display a much\nlarger colour range in the Gemini CMD. The poor Strehl\nratio in the Gemini/Hokupa'a data as compared to the\nHST/NICMOS data (see Sect. 2.1.5) causes a high, nonuniform additional background due to uncompensated seeing halos around bright stars, which decreases photometric accuracy. In the dense regions of the cluster center,\nwhere crowding problems are most severe, the photometry is most affected. The number of faint, unresolved\ncompanion stars that merge into the high stellar background underneath the bright cluster population is very\nhigh. As discussed in Sect. 2.1.4, the halos of the bright\nstars hinder the detection of faint objects despite the principally high spatial resolution seen in individual PSF kernels. Operating at the diffraction limit, NICMOS is not\nrestricted by these effects, yielding a better effective resolution especially in the dense regions. A tighter main sequence and less scatter is the consequence. In Fig. 9, the\ninnermost 5\u2032\u2032 of the Arches cluster are marked by open\ncircles. It is clearly seen that most massive (bright) stars\nare located in the cluster center.\nA second effect observed is the much larger number\nof faint objects seen in the HST data (cf. Fig. 2). As the\nlimiting magnitude and the measured spatial resolution of\nthe images are similar in both datasets, this, too, has to\nbe a consequence of the low Strehl ratio in the AO data.\nThe lower panel of Fig. 9 shows the \"dereddened\"\nCMDs, corrected for the radial colour gradient found and\nthe corresponding change in extinction, \u2206AK (Sect. 3.1).\nThe colours of stars beyond R > 5\u2032\u2032 have been adjusted\nto the colour of the cluster center. Comparison with the\noriginal CMDs shows that most of the bright, seemingly\nreddened stars fall onto the same main sequence after correcting for the colour trend. These stars are located at\nlarger distances from the cluster center and thus suffer\nfrom more reddening by residual dust. As will be discussed\nin the context of the mass function (Sect. 5), these stars\nmight have formed close to the cluster at a similar time\nas the cluster population. At the faint end of the CMD,\nthere are, however, a large number of objects that remain unusually red after the correction has been applied.\nThese objects may either be pre-main sequence stars or\nfaint background sources. Unfortunately, we are not able\nto disentangle these two possible contributions, and will\n\nFig. 9. Colour-magnitude diagrams.\nLeft: Gemini/Hokupa'a, right: HST/NICMOS\nLower panel: CMDs corrected for radial reddening gradient (Sect. 3.1)\n\nthus exclude objects significantly reddened relative to the\nmain sequence when deriving the mass function.\n\n3.4. HST/NICMOS colour-colour diagram\nFor comparison with the reddening path and a main sequence in standard colours, the NICMOS filters have been\ntransformed into the 2MASS JHKs system. In Fig. 10,\nwe show the transformed HST/NICMOS colour-colour\ndiagram for the stars bright enough to be observed in\nall three filters. The AV values are from the Rieke &\nLebofsky (1985) extinction law for standard JHK photometry. Though we are aware of the uncertainties inherent to the transformation of severely reddened stars,\nthe proximity of the reddening path to the data points\nsupports the validity of the equations derived by BGB.\nChanging the transformation parameters slightly results\nin a large angle between the data points and the reddening path.\nA wide spread population of stars is clearly seen along\nthe reddening path, as expected from the colour trend discussed in Sect. 3.1 (no correction for the varying extinction\nhas been applied in this diagram). Again, the stars with\nthe lowest reddening within the cluster population are the\n\n\f12\n\nA.

The individual extinction has been calculated by shifting the\nstars in the K vs. H \u2212 K colour-magnitude diagram to a 2 Myr isochrone offset bluewards of the main sequence.\nTransformation to AK = 0 mag has been performed afterwards, to avoid large errors in the shifting procedure. This\nresults in a minimum AK of 1.86 mag, and a maximum of 4.08 mag, assuming a Rieke & Lebofsky (1985) extinction\nlaw.\n\nFig. 8b is available in jpeg format on astro-ph\n\nFig. 8.

Moving along the\nreddening line towards higher values of AV mainly means\nmoving radially outwards from the cluster center. As in\nthe CMD, a correction for the observed colour gradient\ncauses the bulk of the stars to fall onto the main sequence\nwith a reddening of AV = 24 mag, corresponding to the\ncluster center.\n\n4. Luminosity Functions and incompleteness\neffects\n4.1. Integrated luminosity function\nIn Fig. 11, we compare the Gemini with the HST lu\u2032\nminosity function for the Ktrans\nvs. m205 observations.\nFor direct comparison of the observational efficiency, no\ncolour cut has been applied, but the entire physically reasonable colour range from approximately 0 to 4 mag in\nH \u2212 K \u2032 , including reddened and foreground objects, has\n\n\fA.

The area between the dashed lines marks the\nregion of reddened main sequence stars.\n\nbeen included in the luminosity function (LF). Therefore,\nthese LFs are not the ones from which the mass functions have been derived. The only selection criterion that\nhas been applied is a restriction of the photometric uncertainty in both magnitude (\u03c3K \u2032 < 0.2 mag) and colour\n(\u03c3H\u2212K \u2032 < 0.28 mag, corresponding to \u03c3K \u2032 < 0.2 mag\nand \u03c3H < 0.2 mag). The uncertainty selection in colour\nallowed us to select only those objects that have been detected with high confidence in both H and K \u2032 images in\nthe Gemini data, and in the F160W and F205W filters in\nthe NICMOS data, respectively. The colour-uncertainty\nselection on the HST data simulates the matching of H\nand K \u2032 detections used on the Gemini data for the selection of real objects. Thus, only objects that are detected in\nboth H and K \u2032 have been included in the luminosity function. This gives us some confidence that we are not picking\nup hot pixels or cosmic ray events. The area covered with\nGemini has been selected from the HST photometry as\ndisplayed in Fig. 1.\nAs can be seen in Fig. 11, many objects are missed by\nGemini in the fainter regime, though the actual limiting\n(i.e., cut-off) magnitudes are the same in both datasets.\nThis is due to the fact that 50 % of the light is distributed\ninto a halo around each star. These halos prevent the detection of faint objects around bright sources, especially\nin the crowded regions. This effect is most obvious when\nexamining the star-subtracted frames resulting from the\nDAOPHOT allstar task. In these frames the cluster center is marked by a diffuse background, enhanced by \u223c 20\ncounts in K \u2032 and \u223c 40 counts in H above the observational\nbackground of 2 and 4 counts in the cluster vicinity, respectively. In addition to the simple crowding problem due\nto the stellar density affecting both datasets, the overlap\nof many stellar halos hinders the detection of faint stars in\nthe Gemini data. At larger radial distances from the cluster center, more and more faint stars are detected both in\nthe HST as well as in the Gemini data (Fig. 12).\n\n13\n\nFig. 11. Comparison of Gemini versus HST luminosity\nfunctions.\nThe fact that the incompleteness corrected Gemini LFs\nfollow closely the shape of the HST LFs supports the results of our incompleteness calculations, which will be used\nto determine the incompleteness in the mass function.\n\n4.2. Radial variation of the luminosity function\nRadial luminosity functions were calculated in \u2206R = 5 \u2032\u2032\nbins, using the same uncertainty selection as in Fig. 11\n(Sect. 4.1). The resulting radial LFs are shown in Fig. 12,\nalong with the incompleteness determined for each radial\nbin. In the cluster center (lowest panel), the very good\n\u2032\nmatch of the Gemini and HST LFs for Ktrans\n< 16 mag\nreveals the comparable spatial resolution obtained in both\ndata sets. Despite the strong crowding seen already in\nthese bright stars, the Gemini AO data resolve the sources\nin the cluster center nicely. When we move on to fainter\nmagnitudes, however, we are limited by the halos of these\nbright stars, as discussed above. The clear decrease be\u2032\nlow Ktrans\n= 16 mag marks the point where stars are lost\ndue to the enhanced background. When we move radially\noutwards, the limiting magnitude above which faint stars\nare lost shifts towards fainter magnitudes. The tendency\nto loose the faint tail of the magnitude distribution nevertheless remains clearly seen, though it becomes much less\npronounced for R > 10\u2032\u2032 , where the Gemini and HST LFs\nresemble each other. For R > 15\u2032\u2032 (upper panel) we are\nlimited by small number statistics due to the small area\nin this radial bin. As it is hard to observe a well-defined\nLF at these radii, we will add the two upper bins when we\ncreate the radially dependent mass functions in Sect. 5.3.\nThe magnitude-dependent distribution of stars within\nthe cluster is evident in these LFs. While bright stars are\npredominantly found in the cluster center, their number\ndensity strongly decreases with increasing radius. When\nwe analyse the Gemini LFs more quantitatively, we find\n\u2032\n< 13(14) mag within R < 5\u2032\u2032 ,\n25 (50) stars with Ktrans\nbut only 8 (23) such stars with 5 < R < 10\u2032\u2032 , and beyond\n10\u2032\u2032 , we observe only 7 (11) such stars. The numbers for\nHST are comparable in the bright magnitude bins. On\n\u2032\nthe other hand, the number of faint stars with Ktrans\n>\n\n\f14\n\nA. Stolte et al.: Mass Function of the Arches Cluster\n\nd(log N )/d(log M ) \u223c M \u0393\nwhere M is usually given in solar masses, and \u0393 is the slope\nof the mass function. The exact shape of the mass function\nand, in particular, its slope, has been subject of intense\ndiscussion (see, e.g., Massey 1995a, 1995b; Scalo 1986; and\nScalo 1998 for a review). Massey et al. (1995a, 1995b) report slopes between \u22120.7 and \u22121.7 with a weighted mean\nof \u22121.1 \u00b1 0.1 for M > 7 M\u2299 in several starforming regions\nin the Milky Way, and \u22121.1 < \u0393 < \u22121.6 with a mean\nof \u22121.3 \u00b1 0.1 for M > 25 M\u2299 in the LMC. From these\nstudies in young clusters and associations, the mass function has been suspected to be rather universal, following\na Salpeter (1955) power law with a slope of \u0393 = \u22121.35\nfor stars with masses M \u2265 1 M\u2299 (Kroupa 2001). For the\ntwo starburst clusters studied in the Milky Way, Arches\n(FKM) and NGC 3603 (Eisenhauer 1998), a flat slope of\n\u223c \u22120.7 is observed for masses M > 10M\u2299 in Arches, and\nM > 1M\u2299 in NGC 3603. These values have to be kept in\nmind as a comparison for the results presented in the following sections. The mass regime which will be discussed\nhere spans a mass range of 6 < M < 65 M\u2299 for Arches\ncluster stars.\n\n5.1. Integrated mass function\nFig. 12. Radial variation of the luminosity function. The\ncomparison of Gemini and HST LFs is shown together\nwith the Gemini incompleteness calculation. The dependence of the magnitude limits on the distance to the cluster center is striking.\n18(19) mag increases from 1 (0) to 14 (3) to 48 (16). As\nwe see significantly more faint stars in the HST data, the\ncorresponding numbers are higher, i.e. the number of stars\nwith m205 > 19 mag is 0 in the innermost bin, 24 in the\nintermediate bin, and 81 in the outermost bin. Despite the\nfact that the area on the Gemini frame increases by about\na factor of 3 between the inner and intermediate bin, the\nnumber of bright stars is strongly diminished beyond a few\narcseconds, while the number of the faint stars increases\nby much more than the change in area can account for.\nAlthough for the fainter stars the effects of crowding and a\nreal increase in the fainter population of the cluster cannot\nbe disentangled, the decrease in the number of bright stars\nis a clear indication of mass segregation within the Arches\ncluster.\n\n5. Mass Function\nThe mass function (MF) may be defined as the number of\nstars observed in a certain mass bin. The mass function\nin stellar populations is most frequently fitted by a power\nlaw, whose slope depends on the mass range analysed (e.g,\nKroupa 2001). In the logarithmic representation, the mass\nfunction is defined as\n\nThe present-day mass function (Fig. 13) of the Arches\ncluster has been derived from the colour-magnitude diagram by transforming stellar luminosities into masses via a\n2 Myr isochrone from the Geneva basic set of stellar evolution models (Lejeune & Schaerer 2001) using the method\ndescribed in Grebel & Chu (2000). Enhanced mass loss\nmodels were also used, but did not alter the resultant\nmass function. Stellar evolution (mass loss, giant evolution) is not important on timescales of the Arches age\nof \u223c 2 Myr for stars with initial masses of M < 50 M\u2299\n(log(M/M\u2299 ) < 1.7, i.e. stellar evolution affects the two\nupper mass bins of the MF at most). No attempt has been\nmade to reconstruct the initial mass function (IMF) from\nthe present-day MF for M > 50 M\u2299 . A distance modulus\nof 14.5 mag and an extinction of AV = 24.1 mag have\nbeen applied.\nThe slopes of all mass functions discussed have been\nderived by performing a weighted least-squares fit to the\nnumber of stars per mass bin. The size of the mass bins was\nchosen to be \u03b4 log(M/M\u2299 ) = 0.1 as the best compromise\nbetween mass function resolution and statistical relevance.\nThis bin size is significantly larger than the photometric\nuncertainty in the considered mass and thus magnitude\nranges. Only mass bins with a completeness factor of \u2265\n75% have been included in the fit.\nNote that we have not attempted to subtract the field\nstar contribution. As can be seen in Fig. 1, the Gemini field\nis mostly restricted to the densest cluster region. When\ncomparing to an arbitrary part of the GC field, we do not\nexpect to observe the same distribution of stars as in the\n\n\fA. Stolte et al.: Mass Function of the Arches Cluster\n\nArches field, as the faint, reddened background sources are\nnegligible due to the high density of bright sources in the\ncluster area.\nIn addition, the stellar density in the GC is strongly\nvariable, imposing additional uncertainties on the field\ncontribution. Neither the Gemini nor the HST field covers enough area to estimate the field star population in\nthe immediate vicinity of the cluster. A main sequence\ncolour cut (1.15 < H \u2212 K < 1.90 mag) has been applied\nto the colour-corrected CMDs to select Arches members,\nexcluding blue foreground and red background sources.\nTo allow for a direct comparison with the results obtained in FKM, we have used isochrones calculated for a\nmetallicity of Z = 0.04 for all MF derivations. The derived\nMFs are displayed in Fig. 13. The overall mass function\nderived from the Gemini data displays the same slope as\nderived from NICMOS within the uncertainties, namely\n\u0393Gemini = \u22120.77 \u00b1 0.16 and \u0393HST = \u22120.82 \u00b1 0.14 fitted\nfor 10 < M < 65 M\u2299 (Fig. 13), which may be extrapolated\ndown to 6 M\u2299 when taking into account the incompleteness correction. The present-day upper mass of 65 M\u2299\ncorresponds to an initial mass of about 100 M\u2299 according to the Geneva models. FKM derive an overall slope of\n\u0393 = \u22120.7\u00b10.1 in the inital mass range 6 < M < 120 M\u2299 , in\ngood agreement with our results. The remaining difference\nin the maximum mass is due to the different extinction\nand the extinction corrections applied, which represent\nthe largest uncertainties in the mass function derivation.\nAs in particular the correction of the K magnitude for the\nvarying extinction is uncertain due to the unknown extinction law of the NICMOS filters, we have also derived the\nmass function for uncorrected K magnitudes, with only\nthe colour correction applied, which is independent of the\nextinction law assumed. In this case, the MF appears flatter with a slope of \u0393 \u223c \u22120.5 \u00b1 0.2 (Fig. 13, lower panel).\nThe discrepancy in the derived slopes clearly shows that\nthe effects of differential extinction are not negligible, especially when deriving mass functions for very young regions, where the reddening varies significantly.\nFurthermore, we have checked the effect of the binning\non the MF by shifting the starting point of each bin by one\ntenth of the bin-width, \u03b4 log(M/M\u2299 ) = 0.01. The resultant slopes range from \u22120.69 \u00b1 0.13 < \u0393Gemini < \u22120.90 \u00b1\n0.15 and \u22120.79\u00b10.12 < \u0393HST < \u22120.98\u00b10.13. The average\nslopes for Gemini and HST, \u0393Gemini = \u22120.77 \u00b1 0.15 and\n\u0393HST = \u22120.86 \u00b1 0.13, respectively, agree well within the\nerrors. The slightly flatter slope observed in the Gemini\ndata may reflect the more severe incompleteness due to\ncrowding. Although all slopes are consistent within the\nerrors, the range in slopes derived by scanning the binstep shows that statistical effects due to the binning may\nnot be entirely neglected in the MF derivation.\nThe metallicity within the immediate Galactic Center\nregion has been a matter of discussion during the past\ndecade. Several authors report supersolar metallicities derived from CO index strength and TiO bands in bulge\nstars (Frogel & Whitford 1987; Rich 1988; Terndrup et\nal. 1990, 1991). Carr et al. (2000) measure [Fe/H] =\n\n15\n\n\u22120.02 \u00b1 0.13 dex for the 7 Myr old supergiant IRS 7,\nand Ramirez et al. (2000) derive an average of [Fe/H]\n= +0.12 \u00b1 0.22 dex for 10 young to intermediate age supergiants, both very close to the solar value.\nUsing a 2 Myr isochrone with solar metallicity Z=0.02,\nthe average slope of all bin steps is \u0393Gemini = \u22120.84 \u00b1 0.13\nand \u0393HST = \u22120.91 \u00b1 0.12. The mass function is thus not\nsignificantly altered when using solar instead of enhanced\nGC metallicity. We note, however, that a lower metallicity (i.e., in this case solar) steepens the MF slightly, thus\nworking into the same direction as the incompleteness correction.\nFKM report a flat portion of the MF in the range\n15 < M < 50 M\u2299 , which is not seen in the Gemini MF. This\nplateau can, however, be recovered, when we create a MF\nfrom K-band magnitudes uncorrected for differential extinction, and use a lowest mass of log(Mlow /M\u2299 ) = 0.25.\nFor log(Mlow /M\u2299 ) = 0.20 the plateau is seen neither with\nnor without extinction correction. This, again, shows the\ndependence of the shape of the MF on the extinction corrections applied, as well as on the chosen binning.\nFrom the considerations above, we conclude that the\noverall mass function of the Arches cluster has a slope of\n\u0393 = \u22120.8 to \u22120.9 in the range 6 < M < 65 M\u2299 . Although\nthe uncertainty of missing lower mass stars in the immediate cluster center remains, the incompleteness correction\nstrongly supports the derived shape of the MF. If the flat\nslope would be solely due to a low recovery rate of lowmass stars in the cluster center, this should be visible in\na much steeper rise of the incompleteness corrected MF\nin contrast to the observed MF. We thus conclude that\nthe slope of the MF observed in Arches is flatter than the\nSalpeter slope of \u0393 = \u22121.35, assumed to be a standard\nmass distribution in young star clusters. Such a flat mass\nfunction is a strong indication of the efficient production\nof high-mass stars in the Arches cluster and the GC environment.\n\n5.2. Effects of the chosen isochrone, bin size, and\nmetallicity\nBlum et al. (2001) estimate a cluster age of 2 \u2212 4.5 Myr\nfor Arches assuming that the observed high-mass stars\nare of type WN7. If we compare the Geneva basic grid\nof isochrones with fundamental parameters obtained for\nWN7 stars (Crowther et al. 1995), a reasonable upper age\nlimit for this set of isochrones is \u223c 3.5 Myr. Crowther compares the parameters derived for WN stars with evolutionary models at solar metallicity from Schaller et al. (1992)\nand with the mass-luminosity relation for O supergiants\nfrom Howarth & Prinja (1989), yielding a mass range of\n20 \u2212 55 M\u2299 , but with high uncertainties at the low-mass\nend. The more reliable mass estimates for the colour and\nmagnitude range observed for WN stars in Arches are restricted to 35 < M < 55 M\u2299 . From spectroscopic binaries, the masses of two WN7 stars are determined to be\n\u223c 30 M\u2299 and > 48 M\u2299 (Smith & Maeder 1989). The the-\n\n\f16\n\nA. Stolte et al.: Mass Function of the Arches Cluster\n\noretical lower limit to form Wolf-Rayet stars is 25 M\u2299 for\nthe Geneva models (Schaerer et al. 1993).\nIn the Geneva basic grid of models with Z = 0.04, the\n3.5 Myr isochrone is limited by a turnoff mass of 32 M\u2299 .\nWe have thus calculated mass functions for isochrones\nwith ages 2.5, 3.2, and 3.5 Myr in addition to the 2 Myr\ncase discussed above. Though the derived slopes scatter\nwidely, irrespective of the isochrone used, the slope of the\nMF tends to be even flatter for any of the older population\nmodels. We thus conclude that, regardless of the choice of\nmodel and parameters, the Arches mass function displays\na flat slope.\n\n5.3. Radial variation in the mass function\nThe radial variation (Fig. 14) of the mass function is particularly interesting with respect to YC evolution. We\nhave analysed the stellar population in Arches within\nthree different radial bins, 0\u2032\u2032 < R < 5\u2032\u2032 , 5\u2032\u2032 < R < 10\u2032\u2032\nand 10\u2032\u2032 < R < 20\u2032\u2032 . The resulting mass functions for the\nGemini and HST datasets, along with the radius dependent incompleteness correction for the Gemini MFs, are\ndisplayed in Fig. 14.\nWe confirm the flat mass function observed by FKM\nin the innermost regions of the cluster, which steepens\nrapidly beyond the innermost few arcseconds. Most of the\nbright, massive stars are found in the dense cluster center,\nwhere the mass function slope is very flat. FKM derive a\nslope of \u0393 = \u22120.1 \u00b1 0.2 from the HST data in this region,\nwhich is consistent with Fig. 14. It is obvious from the\nlowest panel in Fig. 14 that we are crowding limited in\nthe innermost region. We have thus not tried to fit a slope\nfor R < 5\u2032\u2032 .\nIn the next bin, 5\u2032\u2032 < R < 10\u2032\u2032 , the mass function\nobtained from the weighted least-squares fit has already\nsteepened to a slope of \u0393 = \u22121.0 \u00b1 0.3. Again, the MF in\nthis radial bin remains significantly flatter (\u0393 = \u22120.5\u00b10.4)\nwhen no AK -correction is applied. Beyond 10\u2032\u2032 (0.4 pc,\nupper panel), a power law can only be defined in the range\n10 < M < 30 M\u2299 (1.0 < log(M/M\u2299 ) < 1.5), where a slope\nof \u0393 = \u22121.69 \u00b1 0.66 is found, consistent with a Salpeter\n(\u0393 = \u22121.35) law. The large error obviously reflects the\nsmall number of mass bins used in the fit. Nevertheless,\nFig. 14 clearly reveals the steepening of the MF very soon\nbeyond the cluster center.\nFor a more quantitative confirmation of the mass segregation present in the Arches cluster, we created cumulative functions for the mass distributions in the three radial\nbins (Fig. 15). We have applied a Kolmogorov-Smirnov\ntest to quantify the observed differences of these functions.\nWhen the central, intermediate, and outer radial bin are\ncompared pairwise, we obtain in each case a confidence\nlevel of more than 99 % that the mass distributions do\nnot originate from the same distribution.\nThus, the inner regions of the cluster are indeed skewed\ntowards higher masses either by sinking of the high mass\nstars towards the cluster center due to dynamical pro-\n\ncesses or by primordial mass segregation, or both. The\nsame effect is observed in the similarly young cluster\nNGC 3603 (Grebel et al. 2002, in prep.).\n\n5.4. Formation locus of massive stars\nWe find several (5) high mass stars in the cluster vicinity. These stars fall onto the Arches main sequence after\napplying the reddening correction (Sect. 3.1). When the\nentire HST field is separated into two equalsize areas, the\nfirst area being a circle of radius 16\u2032\u2032 around the cluster\ncenter, and the second the surrounding field, no additional\ncomparably high-mass stars are found with Arches main\nsequence colours except for the two bright stars found at\nthe edges of the Gemini field. In the dynamical models of\nBonnell & Davies (1998) there is a low, but non-zero probability that a massive star originating outside the cluster's half-mass radius might remain in the cluster vicinity.\nHigh-mass stars formed near the center show, however,\na tendency to migrate closer to the cluster center. The\ndisruptive GC potential might enhance the ejection process of low-mass stars, but according to equipartition, it\nis unlikely that the most massive stars gain energy due to\ndynamical interaction with lower mass objects. We have\nto bear in mind, however, that interactions between massive stars in the dense cluster core could cause the ejection\nof high-mass stars.\nN-body simulations performed by Portegies Zwart et\nal. (1999) show that the inclusion of dynamical mass segregation in cluster evolution models enhances the collision\nrate by about a factor of 10 as compared to theoretical\ncross section considerations. For a cluster with 12000 stars\ninitially distributed according to a Scalo (1986) mass function, a relaxation time of 10 Myr, and a central density\nand half-mass radius comparable to the values found in\nArches, about 15 merging collisions occur within the first\n10 Myr (1 trelax ) of the simulated cluster. Shortly after\nthe start of the simulations, frequent binary and multiple\nsystems form from dynamical interactions leading to the\nejection of several contributing massive stars. The flat MF\nin the Arches center as compared to a Scalo MF, containing a larger fraction of massive stars to interact, may even\nincrease the collision rate.\nThough it is likely that the high-mass stars seen in\nthe immediate vicinity of the Arches cluster have formed\nfrom the same molecular cloud at the same time as the\ncluster, a final conclusion on the possible ejection of these\nstars from the cluster core due to dynamical processes can\nonly be drawn when velocities for these cluster member\ncandidates are available.\n\n6. Comparison with cluster formation models\nIn this section, we will first use the simple analytical approach to analyse internal cluster dynamics as summarised\nin Binney & Tremaine (1987), and will then compare the\nderived dynamical timescales to N-body simulations where\n\n\fA. Stolte et al.: Mass Function of the Arches Cluster\n\n17\n\nFig. 14. Radial change of the mass function as observed\nin the Gemini/Hokupa'a data. A very flat mass function\nis seen in the inner cluster regions, where predominantly\nmassive stars are found.

Arches mass function derived from the\nGemini/Hokupa'a colour-magnitude diagram shown\nin Fig. 9. A 2 Myr main sequence isochrone from the\nGeneva set of models (Lejeune & Schaerer 2001) was used\nto transform magnitudes into stellar masses. The mass\nfunction has been derived for bins of \u03b4 log(M/M\u2299 ) = 0.1\nwith a lowest mass bin log(M/M\u2299 ) = 0.20.\nUpper panel: with AK correction\nLower panel: without AK correction\n\nthe tidal force of the Galactic Center potential is considered.\nFrom the transformation of stellar magnitudes into\nmasses, a rough estimate of the timescales relevant for\ndynamical cluster evolution can be made. For larger area\ncoverage, we have used the HST/NICMOS data in the\ncalculation below. The timescales characterising cluster\nevolution are the cluster's crossing time, tcross , which is\nsimply given by some characteristic radius divided by the\naverage velocity, i.e., the mean velocity dispersion of the\ncluster, rc /h\u03c3i, and the relaxation time, trh . The median\nrelaxation time is the time after which gravitational encounters of stars have caused the system to equilibrate to\n\na state independent of the original stellar orbits (Binney\n& Tremaine 1987, hereafter BT87)\n\u0012\n\u00133/2\n\u00131/2 \u0012\n\u0013\u0012\nM\n1 M\u2299\nrc\n6.63 * 108 yr\n,\ntrh =\nln(0.4N )\n105 M\u2299\nm\u2217\n1 pc\nwhere M is the total mass within some characteristic radius rc , m\u2217 is a characteristic stellar mass, here defined as\nthe median of the observed mass distribution, and N is the\nnumber of stars in the cluster. trh may also be expressed\nin terms of the crossing time, trh \u223c 0.1 N/ ln N * tcross .\nTo evaluate the above formula, we need to know the\ntotal mass of the system, M , a characteristic radius, rc ,\nthe number of stars, N , and the characteristic stellar mass,\nm\u2217 . In principle, we are able to derive most of these quantities from isochrone fitting, by assigning each star a mass\ncorresponding to its K-band luminosity, and analysing the\nresulting spatial distribution of masses. Naturally, these\nindividual masses cannot be accurate for each star, as they\ndepend strongly on the choice of the isochrone and inherit\nthe uncertainties of the photometry. The integrated properties are, however, not very sensitive to the age of the\nmodel isochrone used, within the reasonable age range\nof Arches, \u223c 2 \u2212 3 Myr (results will be given below).\nWe have attempted to create a density profile from the\nHST/NICMOS data, but as the profile appears to be very\ndistorted, we have chosen to use the half-mass radius, rhm ,\nas a characteristic scale. rhm has been obtained from the\nobserved stellar population of the cluster under the assumption that the mass in the cluster center, relevant for\n\n\f18\n\nA. Stolte et al.: Mass Function of the Arches Cluster\n\nFig. 15. Cumulative functions of the stars in each radial\nbin obtained from HST/NICMOS data. Each radial bin\ncorresponds to one radial mass function in Fig. 14. The\ncumulative distributions have been normalised at 10 M\u2299 ,\nthe limit where all radii are more than 75 % complete.\nthe spatial scale on which gravitational interactions are\nimportant, is dominated by the detected high-mass stellar population in the cluster center. The relaxation time\nderived from rhm is usually referred to as the \"half-mass\nrelaxation time\" (cf. Portegies Zwart et al. 2002).\nThe mass distribution within the cluster as derived\nfrom the isochrone allows us to estimate rhm , M , and m\u2217 .\nTaking all stars within a certain radius with Arches main\nsequence colours as cluster members, we can also estimate\nN.\nWe obtain a half-mass radius of rhm = 10\u2032\u2032 =\n\u02c6 0.4 pc,\nirrespective of the age of the isochrone used (2 Myr or\n3.2 Myr) to transform K-band magnitudes into masses.\nThe total mass measured within this radius is M (rhm ) =\n6300 M\u2299 (5400 M\u2299 for the 3.2 Myr isochrone). By extrapolation of the mass function down to 0.1 M\u2299 , FKM derived a total mass of 12000 M\u2299 within 9\u2032\u2032 radius. To estimate the total mass in the cluster center, they used the\nrelative fraction of stars with M > 40 M\u2299 in two annuli\nseparated at R = 3\u2032\u2032 as a scaling factor. This procedure\nignores the segregation of high-mass stars. As the cluster shows strong evidence for mass segregation (see Sect.\n5.3), this may overestimate the total cluster mass (within\nR < 9\u2032\u2032 ). On the other hand, our mass estimate, ignoring incompleteness and the lower mass tail, is a lower\nlimit to the total mass within R < 10\u2032\u2032 . We thus conclude that for an order-of-magnitude estimation, a total\nmass of 104 M\u2299 within the half-mass radius is a good\napproximation. This yields an average mass density of\n\u03c1(R < rhm ) \u223c 4 * 104 M\u2299 pc\u22123 .\nThe calculation of the relaxation time requires an estimate of the characteristic stellar mass and the number\nof stars. The median mass within R < 10\u2032\u2032 is 7.3 M\u2299 in\nour observed mass range of 1.4 < M < 65 M\u2299 in the HST\n\nsample, and the number of stars actually observed is 486.\nWe choose to use the median mass here as a more realistic\nmass estimate than the mean for individual stars participating in interaction processes, as we are aware of the\nfact that the mean is highly biased by the high fraction\nof high-mass stars in the cluster center. Nevertheless, we\nhave to keep in mind that this median value is still unrealistically high as we miss the low-mass tail of the mass\ndistribution, which also has the highest number of stars.\nAs the low-mass tail of the distribution is highly incomplete, we estimate N to be at least 10000 M\u2299/7.3 M\u2299 \u223c\n1400. This results in trh = 1.2 Myr. Decreasing the characteristic mass and increasing the number of stars lengthens\nthe relaxation time. For instance, lowering m\u2217 to 1 M\u2299 ,\nwhere we take into account the fact that the cluster center is mass segregated as opposed to a standard Salpeter\nmass function and thus the characteristic mass of a star\nshould be higher, and raising N to 10000 stars, would result in trh = 6.2 Myr. If a significant fraction of low-mass\nstars would have been formed and survived in the cluster\ncenter, the half-mass relaxation time would increase even\nmore. The present-day relaxation time is thus at least on\nthe order of or longer than the age of the Arches cluster.\nA relaxation time longer than the lifetime of the cluster\nwould imply that not yet sufficient time has passed for dynamical mass segregation to take place and would thus indicate that primordial mass segregation was present at the\ntime of cluster formation. However, we have so far ignored\nthe Galactic Center tidal forces accelerating the dynamical evolution of the cluster. Kim et al. (2000) performed\nN-body simulations using the observed parameters of the\nArches cluster to trace the dynamical evolution of the cluster and constrain initial conditions. They use a total mass\nof 2 * 104 M\u2299 , tidal radius of \u223c 1 pc and a single power-law\nIMF with slopes of \u0393 = \u22120.5, \u22120.75, \u22121.0 and \u22121.35. The\nnumber of stars ranges between 2600 for a lower mass cutoff of mlow = 0.1 M\u2299 and 12700 for mlow = 1 M\u2299 . From\ncomparison with the HST/NICMOS data of FKM their\nmodels yield a power law with \u0393 = \u22120.75 as the most\nprobable initial mass distribution. Although this slope is\nvery close to the observed present-day MF, they also note\nthat mass segregation takes place on timescales as short as\n1 Myr, such that the cluster looses all memory of the initial\nconditions shortly after formation. Portegies Zwart et al.\n(2002) use a Scalo (1986) MF to model the Arches cluster,\nand derive a total cluster mass of 4 * 104M\u2299 , and an initial\nrelaxation time of 20-40 Myr. When comparing with the\nsame set of HST/NICMOS observations, they conclude\nthat a standard IMF can evolve into the current MF due\nto dynamical segregation, and that the IMF did not need\nto be overpopulated in high-mass stars. Their computations indicate that the relaxation time is strongly variable.\nDuring the dynamical evolution, trh increases strongly after core collapse, which occurs within \u223c 2 Myr, due to\ncluster re-expansion, and only starts to decrease after 10\nMyr or later. The observed relaxation time does thus probably not trace the cluster's initial conditions, but reflects\nthe current dynamical state in the evolution of Arches. In\n\n\fA. Stolte et al.: Mass Function of the Arches Cluster\n\nparticular, a present-day relaxation time larger than the\ncluster's age does not necessarily imply that the cluster is\nnot dynamically relaxed.\nUnfortunately, this means that we are not able to distinguish between primordial and dynamical mass segregation from the estimated relaxation time. For the Orion\nNuclear Cluster (ONC) and its core, the Trapezium,\nwhich has been studied in greater detail (e.g., Hillenbrand\n1997, Hillenbrand & Hartmann 1998), Bonnell & Davies\n(1998) derive dynamical timescales too long to explain\nthe segregation observed in high-mass stars within the\nTrapezium by dynamical evolution, concluding that a significant amount of primordial segregation must have been\npresent. In the case of the Arches cluster, the external\ngravitational field acts towards a fast disruption, thereby\nimpeding the equilibration process, such that dynamical\nsegregation may well be under way.\nAs the different model calculations do not agree\nwith respect to the IMF required to create the observed present-day mass distribution, a final conclusion\non whether or not the Arches initial mass function had to\nbe enriched in massive stars, thus supporting high-mass\nstar formation models, cannot be drawn.\nThe evaporation time, setting the scale for dynamical dissolution by internal processes, can be estimated as\ntevap \u2248 136 trelax \u223c 177 Myr (857 Myr for m\u2217 = 1 M\u2299 ,\nBT87). Kim et al. (1999) have shown that the time required to disrupt an Arches-like cluster within the GC\npotential is only 10 Myr, much shorter than evaporation\nby internal processes will ever be relevant. The models\nby Portegies Zwart et al. (2002) suggest somewhat longer\nevaporation times in the range 30 < tevap < 50 Myr for an\nArches-like cluster. The external potential is thus the dominating factor in the dynamical evolution of Arches. Note\nthat, however, even a cluster as dense as Arches would\nnot survive for more than 1 Gyr independent of its locus of formation. The relaxation and evaporation times\nfound for Arches are very similar to our results for the\nyoung, compact cluster in NGC 3603 (Grebel et al. 2002,\nin prep.). However, as NGC 3603 is not torn apart by additional external tidal forces, it may survive much longer\nthan Arches. For comparison, massive young clusters in\nthe Magellanic Clouds have relaxation times of \u223c 108 yr,\nand corresponding evaporation times of \u223c 1010 yr (e.g.,\nSubramaniam et al. 1993), and may thus survive for one\nHubble time.\n\n7. Conclusions\nWe have analysed high-resolution Gemini/Hokupa'a adaptive optics and HST/NICMOS data of the Arches cluster\nnear the Galactic Center with respect to spatial variations in the mass function and their implications for cluster formation. A detailed comparison of the Gemini data\nto HST/NICMOS observations allows us to investigate\nthe instrumental characteristics of PSF fitting photometry with the Hokupa'a AO system.\n\n19\n\n7.1. Technical comparison of Gemini/Hokupa'a with\nHST/NICMOS\nThe calibration of the Gemini/Hokupa'a data of the\nArches cluster using HST/NICMOS data from Figer et\nal. (1999) allows us to carry out a detailed technical\ncomparison of the two datasets. Maps of photometric\nresiduals show a strong dependence of the calibration error on the stellar density within the field. In particular,\nthe vicinity of fainter objects to bright stars causes the\nGemini magnitude to be underestimated in comparison\nwith HST/NICMOS. This is understandable as the uncompensated seeing halos of bright stars enhance the background in a non-homogeneous way, thereby causing an\noverestimation of the background and a subsequent underestimation of the faint objects' magnitude. Conversely, the\nflux of very bright sources seems to be overestimated. The\ncorrelation of the photometric residual with the position of\nbright stars is more pronounced in K \u2032 , where crowding is\nthe dominant source of photometric uncertainty, while the\neffect of angular anisoplanatism is less severe. In the Hband the anisoplanatism is more pronounced, and hence\nphotometric uncertainties are a blend of uncertainties due\nto the distance to the guide star and due to the proximity\nto bright sources.\nThe incompleteness of the luminosity function measured with Hokupa'a increases faster at fainter magnitudes\nthan the incompleteness observed in the NICMOS LF\ndespite the comparable detection limit in both datasets.\nAs expected, this effect is particularly pronounced in the\ndense cluster center, where crowding is most severe.\nAs the Strehl ratio determines the amount of light scattered into the seeing induced halo around each star, a good\nSR is crucial to achieve not only a diffraction limited spatial resolution, but to benefit from the adaptive optics\ncorrection in dense fields containing a wide range of magnitudes. In the Arches dataset, the SR of only 2.5 % in\nH and 7 % in K \u2032 as compared to 95 % in F160W and\n90 % in F205W (NICMOS) is clearly the limiting factor\nfor crowded field photometry. As Hokupa'a was initially\ndesigned and developed for the 3.6m CFH telescope, its\nperformance at the 8m Gemini telescope is naturally constrained by the limited number of only 36 actuators. In the\ncase of the Arches science demonstration data, additional\nconstraints were given by the seeing, the high airmass due\nto the low latitude of the Galactic Center, and the guide\nstar magnitude. Under better observing conditions and\nwith a brighter guide star Strehl ratios of up to 30 % can\nbe achieved with Hokupa'a at Gemini. Higher order AO\nsystems are currently capable to produce SRs of up to\n50%.\nThe Gemini ground-based AO data are comparable to\nthe HST/NICMOS data in the resolution of bright sources\n(K \u2032 < 18 mag), and in a non-crowded field. They do reach\ntheir limitations in the densest cluster area and in the\ncase where faint stars are located close to a bright object.\nHigher Strehl ratios would of course reduce this unequality.\n\n\f20\n\nA. Stolte et al.: Mass Function of the Arches Cluster\n\n7.2. Photometric results\n\n7.4. Cluster dynamics\n\nA strong colour gradient is detected over the field of the\nArches cluster, revealing an increase in visual extinction\nof approximately 9 < \u2206AV < 15 mag when progressing\noutwards from the cluster center. The visual extinction is\nestimated from the Rieke & Lebofsky (1985) extinction\nlaw to be AV \u223c 24 mag in the cluster center, increasing\nto a maximum of 33 < AV < 39 mag in the vicinity, in accordance with Cotera et al. (2000), who found a maximum\nof AV = 37 mag in the Arches field. Within the central\n5\u2032\u2032 radius, however, no colour gradient is observed. This\nindicates that the cluster center has been stripped of the\nremaining dust and gas either by strong stellar winds from\nmassive stars or by photo-evaporation, or both. Beyond\n5\u2032\u2032 , a linear increase in extinction is observed, suggesting\nan increasing amount of dust with distance from the cluster center. Photo-evaporation due to the strong UV radiation of the 8 WN7/8-stars and more than 100 O-stars\nfound in the cluster center is most probably responsible\nfor dust dissolution.\nThe m160 \u2212 m205, m205 (equivalent to H \u2212 K, K)\ncolour-magnitude diagrams derived from the HST and\nGemini data sets both show a bent main sequence following this colour trend. The main sequence straightens\nout when correcting for this colour variation. A spatial\nanalysis of the CMDs reveals the bulk of the bright stars\non the Arches field to be located in the cluster center.\n\nThe flat mass function in the Arches center is a strong\nindication for mass segregation. While the center seems\nto be dominated by high-mass stars, the cluster edges display the standard behaviour of a young stellar population.\nA similar radial dependence of the mass function is observed in the young, compact cluster NGC 3603 (Grebel\net al. 2002, in prep.), located in a normal star forming environment in the Carina spiral arm. The fact that two out\nof three compact young clusters found in the Milky Way,\nwhich have been analysed in such detail to date, display\na flat mass function slope in the core indicates that such\na behaviour might be typical for starburst clusters and is\nnot restricted to the extreme GC environment.\nMass segregation in a compact, massive cluster can\neither be caused by an enhanced production efficiency of\nmassive stars, or by dynamical segregation during the cluster's evolution. We roughly estimate the present-day relaxation time of Arches from mass function considerations\nto be about a few Myr (\u223c 20 tcross ), and thus of the same\norder of magnitude as the cluster age of \u223c 2 Myr. Again,\na similar timescale has been found for NGC 3603 as well\n(Grebel et al. 2002, in prep.). The comparison with Nbody simulations suggests, however, that the dynamical\nevolution of massive clusters close to the Galactic Center\nwhipes out the initial conditions within less than 1 Myr.\nWe are therefore not able to distinguish between primordial and dynamical mass segregation. Both effects are intertwined at the current state of cluster evolution, such\nthat a detailed dynamical analysis is crucial for a thorough\nunderstanding of the formation process. This analysis has\nto await deep, high resolution infrared spectroscopy to obtain radial velocities and proper motions for a significant\nfraction of stars belonging to the cluster population.\n\n7.3. Mass functions\nPresent-day mass functions have been derived from the\nCMDs after linear correction of the colour trend and corresponding change in extinction over the field, and selection\nof a reasonable main sequence colour cut. The integrated\nmass function derived from the Gemini photometry displays a slope of \u0393 = \u22120.8 \u00b1 0.15 for 6 < M < 65 M\u2299 , less\nsteep than the Salpeter slope of \u0393 = \u22121.35. This value\nagrees with the slopes derived from the HST data in the\nsame manner (Sect. 5), and with the values presented in\nFKM within the uncertainties. When the magnitudes are\nnot corrected for differential extinction, the slope of the\nMF is significantly flatter, \u0393 \u223c \u22120.5 \u00b1 0.2. Particularly\nin young star forming regions, the effects of differential\nextinction are thus clearly non-negligible.\nThe analysis of the radial dependence of the mass function reveals a very flat IMF in the immediate cluster center with a slope close to zero. The IMF slope seems to\nincrease outwards with \u0393 = \u22121.0 \u00b1 0.3 for 5 < R < 10\u2032\u2032\nand \u0393 = \u22121.7 \u00b1 0.7 beyond R > 10\u2032\u2032 . We have created\ncumulative functions for the stars in each radial bin, and\nperformed a KS test to derive the significance level of the\nvariance in the mass distributions. The probability for the\nobserved distributions to originate in the same mass function is below 1% when comparing each two of the three\nradial bins analysed.\n\nAcknowledgements.
