Using a pseudoHermitian family of N\u2212state chain models H = H (N ) (\u03bb) we discuss some generic\nproperties of conditionally observable spectra.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nAt the low energies and for the sufficiently weak interactions, quantum mechanics is\na reliable theory. A transition to the full-fledged apparatus of relativistic quantum\nfield theory is, moreover, generally believed to offer its natural extension to the higher\nenergies and/or to the stronger interaction forces. In between these two extremes,\nunfortunately, there exists a huge territory of open theoretical questions. The loss\nof the internal consistency of many approximative phenomenological models may be\nencountered. Their limits of validity at certain parameters are often marked by the\nloss of the reality of the measurable quantities. One of the best known illustrations\nof such a \"quantum catastrophe\" is the complexification of the ground-state energy\nin the solvable model of a Dirac fermion moving in a overcritical external Coulomb\nfield [1]. The same effect is encountered for the Klein-Gordon boson moving in an\nexternal scalar field [2], etc.\nA particularly popular simulation of the breakdown of quantum stability has recently been found via the study of complex, PT \u2212symmetric local potentials admit-\n\nting the completely real spectra [3]. Such an extension of the usual phenomenology\n\noffers multiple advantages in the context of physics (cf., e.g., its recent review [4]).\nAt the same time, its proper implementation requires a fairly complicated mathematical apparatus [5]. This is a serious technical obstacle for any easy explanation of\nthe parameter-controlled transitions between the real and complex energies. In fact,\nwithin the class of the PT \u2212symmetric local potentials the reality of the spectrum\nmay prove extremely fragile [6]. For this reason one feels inclined to turn attention\n\nto the constructive study of the control of the observability of the energies (i.e., of\nthe reality of all the eigenvalues of H) via some simplified models specified, say, by\nsome finite-dimensional matrix Hamiltonians.\nThe first results in this direction were already obtained in our two recent remarks\n[7, 8] where we discussed some phenomenological aspects of certain \"first nontrivial\",\nviz., two- and three-dimensional real-matrix models, respectively. In our present\ncontinuation of this effort we intend to extend our attention to the whole family of\nsimplified matrix models of an arbitrary (say, even) dimension N = 2J.\nThe key encouragement of such a project has been found in our computer-algebrabased paper [9] where we revealed that a transparent mathematical structure can\nemerge not only in the above-mentioned low-dimensional models H (2) and H (3) but\nalso in some of their specific tridiagonal generalizations H (N ) of any dimension N.\n\n2\n\n\fFor our present purposes we pick up a subset of the latter models with the even dimensions N = 2J. The reason is pragmatic \u2013 one finds just purely formal differences\nbetween the separate even- and odd-dimensional series of the models H (N ) of ref. [9].\nOur main message will be preceded by a brief summary of the state of the art in\nsection 2. A more detailed explanation of the problem will then follow in section 3.\nWe emphasize there that several relevant properties of our family of the Hamiltonians may already be observed in its first, one-parametric real-matrix two-by-two\nmember H (2) (\u03bb). We point out the intimate connection between the parity-pseudoHermiticity of the model and the mechanism which makes the \"observability\" (i.e.,\nthe reality) of the energies lost during a smooth change of the \u03bb\u2212dependent matrix\nelements.\nThe next steps of our detailed analysis of chain-models H (N ) (\u03bb) are performed in\nsections 4 and 5 giving a detailed description of the spectra at N = 4 and N = 6,\nrespectively. In section 6 some of the quantitative conclusions of this analysis are\nfound extensible to all the dimensions N = 2J. In particular, within the \"catastrophic\" loss-of-the-observability scenario we stress that the flexibility offered by the\nJ independent matrix elements in H (2J) suffices for the simulation and enumeration\nof the eligible level-confluences igniting the imminent quantum collapse.\nSection 7 is a summary where we re-emphasize an exceptional suitability of our\npresent models for deductions of some universal and generic qualitative conjectures.\n\n2\n\nThe loss of observability in PT \u2212symmetric examples\n\nA deep physical appeal of the PT \u2212symmetric quantum mechanics (PTSQM, [10])\n\nlies in the variability of its definition of the inner product in the \"physical\" Hilbert\nspace of states [11, 12, 13]. The idea itself is in fact not too surprising since it\nhas been discovered, forgotten and rediscovered in field theory [14], in perturbationtheory mathematics [15, 16] as well as in nuclear physics etc [11, 17]. After its recent\nextremely successful popularization by Bender and Boettcher [3] its use helped to\nclarify also the stability of a quantum particle in many complex quantum potentials\n\n[18] \u2013 [21].\nA mathematical core of the PTSQM formalism lies in its work with pseudoHermitian Hamiltonians H such that H \u2020 = P H P \u22121 6= H. The intertwiner P should\n3\n\n\fRe E\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nt\n\nFigure 1: Real parts of the energies in the two-state model as functions of the\nparameter t.\nbe an elementary operator which is, very often, identified with the parity [3, 16].\nThen, the manifestly non-Hermitian Hamiltonian H can only become selfadjoint (or,\nin the language of ref. [11], quasi-Hermitian) with respect to a nontrivial, ad hoc\nmetric operator \u0398 6= I which depends on H = H(\u03bb) and, hence, which can also vary\nwith the parameter \u03bb.\n\nThe selected \u0398 defines the inner product in the Hilbert space of states H(physical)\n\nso that it may become singular at some \"exceptional\" \u03bb [22]. This is precisely what\npaved the way to the practical physical applications of the conditional reality of the\neigenvalues in the single-particle relativistic context of Klein-Gordon equation [23]\nand of Proca equation [24] as well as in the papers on quantum anomalies [25], on\nsupersymmetric models [26] or, beyond quantum-theory context, in cosmology [27]\nand in magnetohydrodynamics [28].\nWe believe that in virtually all of these (and many other) applications the conditional character of the reality of the eigenvalues plays the key role. For this reason\nlet us now perform a certain systematic clarification of the related phenomenological\nas well as purely formal possibilities.\n\n4\n\n\fIm E\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nt\n\nFigure 2: Imaginary parts of the energies in the two-state model as functions of the\nparameter t.\n\n3\n\nThe loss/emergence of observability in a matrix\nexample\n\nThe feasibility of a controlled, conditional transition to the instability characterized\nby the complex eigenvalues may be understood as a direct consequence of the nonHermitian nature of the models H = H(\u03bb) for which the parameter \u03bb either stays\ninside its \"allowed\" physical domain D or some of the energy eigenvalues E become\n\ncomplex. Of course, the variations of \u03bb may be expected to depend on time. For\nthis reason, let us change our notation and replace \u03bb by the more explicit symbol t.\nWhenever our \"time\" t reaches its critical value, the related complexification\ntransition may be most easily visualized in the schematic two-by-two model of ref.

Figures 1 and 2). On the contrary, the matrix H (2) (t) be-\n\ncomes manifestly Hermitian (we could say, \"conventionally physical\") at t \u2208 (1, \u221e).\nIn the middle, \"unconventionally physical\" interval of parameters t \u2208 (0, 1), our nonHermitian Hamiltonian with real energies remains, in the terminology of the review\npaper [11], quasi-Hermitian.\nThe \"unconventional\" choice of t \u2208 (0, 1) leaves our matrix H (2) tractable as a\n\nvalid and acceptable selfadjoint representation of an observable quantity, provided\nonly that our Hilbert space of states H(2) is properly re-defined (cf. the extensive\n\naccounts of this attitude, say, in the reviews [4, 12] or in the proceedings [29]). In\nthis sense the message delivered by our illustrative example (1) may be read as\nemphasizing that even though its form may cease to be manifestly Hermitian, the\noperator H may represent a physical observable (comment [7] may be consulted for\nall the technical details).\nEven though the symbol t represents time, let us keep both the directions of the\nt\u2212development available. Thus, under the tacit assumption that we move to the left\nalong the real t\u2212axis in Figures (1) and (2) we speak about the confluence of the real\nenergy levels followed by their subsequent complexification. This convention will be\npreferred in what follows although, alternatively, we could also change it and call the\nright-ward t\u2212development a \"big-bang-like\" decomplexification of the system which\nstayed unobservable at the earlier times.\nOur specific t\u2212parametrization of the matrix elements is privileged because it\n\n6\n\n\fE\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nt\n\nFigure 4: The four real J = 2 energies at A/2 = B = 1\nmediates the smooth t\u2212dependence of the eigenvalues (or of their squares at least).\nThus, even when the formal Hermiticity and/or quasi-Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian\nH (2) breaks down, both the Figures 1 and 2 confirm that the t = 1 division line\nbetween the Hermitian and non-Hermitian regime is artificial and, in any conceivable\nphenomenological context, irrelevant.\nOur two latter comments are challenging: it is not obvious what can be expected\nto happen at some higher dimensions in a suitable matrix generalization of H (2) .

To the right of both of\nthem, our Hamiltonian H (4) becomes standard and Hermitian, to the left of both of\n\n8\n\n\fE\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nt\n\nFigure 6: The four real J = 2 energies at A = B/5 = 1\nthem, our matrix H (4) remains P\u2212pseudo-Hermitian with respect to the usual parity\n\uf8eb\n\nP=\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0 \u22121 0\n\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\uf8f7\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0 \u22121\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nBetween the vertical lines, an anomalous parity matrix must be chosen to define the\npseudo-Hermiticity,\n\uf8eb\n\nP\u2032 =\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\u22121 0 0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1 0\n\n0\n\n0 1\n\n0\n\n0 0 \u22121\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7\n\n.\n\nIn the complementary scenario we have to weaken the attraction between the peripheral energy levels using B > A. The choice of A = 1 accompanied by the\nweakly enhanced B = 3/2 leads to the result depicted in Figure 5. Due to the\ncomplexification of the most strongly attracted central pair of the levels, the quasiHermiticity is lost for t < t(QH) = 0.2761423749. This takes place safely below the\nupper boundary t(SP H) = 0.5485837704 of the pseudo-Hermitian regime specified by\nthe standard parity operator (8). The latter feature is fragile. At the larger B = 5\nwe get t(SP H) = 0.3582575695 which is perceivably smaller than the complexification\nbound t(QH) = 3/5 (cf. Figure 6).\n\n9\n\n\fRe E\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-0.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\nt\n\nFigure 7: Real parts of the energies in the six-state model (A = B = C = 1).\n\n5\n\nThe next, more complicated chain model with\nsix levels\n\nIn the six-by-six model of ref.

Let us add a\n\n10\n\n\fIm E\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n-1\n\n-1.5\n-0.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\nt\n\nFigure 8: Imaginary parts of the energies in the six-state model (A = B = C = 1).\ncomment that after a temporary reversal of our conventional arrow of time, Figure\n7 mimics an even more interesting scenario of a \"big-bang\" development. From this\npoint of view there exists no observable state of our schematic system at t < 0 and\njust a single, fully degenerate state with E = 0 emerges at t = 0. Subsequently, teh\nevolution becomes characterized by a steady repulsion of the levels.\nAfter we return to our leftwards-running time convention, the peripheral-weakening\nchoice of a dominant C will leave both the outermost levels far away, too weakly attracted and not sufficiently participating in the overall collapsing tendency. The\nfirst complexification will involve only the inner quadruplet of the energies. It may\nproceed either along the two-pair-complexification pattern indicated in Figure 4 (we\nchoose there A = B = C/2 = 1 so that the complementary pseudo-Hermiticity\n\u2032\n\nboundary moved to t(P H ) = 1/2) or along the central-complexification pattern represented by Figures 5 and 6 (necessitating an increase of B).\nThe next eligible choice of dominant A will weaken the central attraction so that\nthe overall loss of the quasi-Hermiticity will be caused by the simultaneous pairwise\nmergers inside the external energy triples. The explicit decision between the two\nexisting possibilities of these E 6= 0 mergers will be controlled by the detailed balance\n\nbetween the size of B and C \u2013 for the weaker C the pattern will resemble Figure 4.\n\nThe last possibility corresponds to the full dominance of the constant B. This\nweakens the attraction between the central and peripheral energy pairs. A characteristic illustration is offered by Figure 9 where the choice of A = B/2 = C = 1 is shown\n\n11\n\n\fRe E\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\n0.45\n\n0.5\n\n0.55\n\n0.6\n\nt\n\nFigure 9: Real parts of the energies in the six-state model at A = B/2 = C = 1.\nto lead to the spectrum characterized by a central-pair-attraction dominance and by\nthe related loss of quasi-Hermiticity at t(QH) = 0.5157267. Our last Figure 10 then\nshows how the other, peripheral-pair-attraction dominance modifies the previous\nresult. With the choice of A = 3, B = 5 and C = 1 we get the triplet of pseudoHermiticity boundaries t(QH) = 0.5436890127, t(QH) = 0.4693964246 and t(QH) =\n0.4273046236. The model loses its quasi-Hermiticity at t < t(QH) = 0.539764657.\n\n6\n\nThe general chain model with N = 2J levels\n\nOne could move on and construct various sample spectra, numerically, at a number\nof the higher even dimensions N = 2J. The same family of the matrix models\nas mentioned in the previous section would still suit our purpose. The three main\nuser-friendly features of all these models can be seen\n\u2022 in the fact that they represent a generalization of eq. (9),\n\u2022 in the nontrivial fact that the same parametrization can be used,\ngn =\n\nq\n\n(max)\n\ngn\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03ben ) ,\n\n\u03ben = t + t2 + . . . + tJ\u22121 + Gn tJ ,\n\nn = 1, 2, . . . , J\n\n\u2022 in the fairly nontrivial recommendation that gn(max) = n (N \u2212 n) (cf. [9]).\n\n12\n\n\fRe E\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n-5\n0.45\n\n0.5\n\n0.55\n\n0.6\n\nt\n\nFigure 10: Real parts of the energies in the six-state model at A/3 = B/5 = C = 1.\nThe numerical experiments of the two preceding sections indicate that the energy\nmergers in the spectra might admit a combinatorial classification. In such a perspective, Figure 1 is still trivial since for the mere two available energy levels at J = 1\nthere exists just their single possible merger. Still, this example enables us introduce a new convention that the two energies will be subscripted by their respective\nunperturbed integer values at g1 = 0 (giving E\u00b11 (t) at J = 1, etc).\nIn this notation, the pair of the Figures 4 and 5 with J = 2 documents that\namong the four available energies, there exist just the two topologically nonequivalent\nmergers. In the first case the evolution in \u2212t connects E3 with E1 and E\u22121 with\n\nE\u22123 , i.e., in an ordered shorthand notation, {[\u22123, \u22121], [1, 3]}. In the second case one\n\nconnects E3 with E\u22123 and E1 with E\u22121 and gets the second symbol, {[\u22123, 3], [\u22121, 1]}.\nIn such an approach we ignore the transitional multiple mergers as sampled in\n\nFigures 3 or 7. Still, the classification of the non-intersecting pairwise connections\nbetween the N = 2J energy levels requires the knowledge of the number P (2J) of\nnonequivalent connections among the levels at every even dimension 2J. For its\nevaluation let us first order the energies in a left-right symmetric string, or lattice,\nE\u2212(2J\u22121) , E\u2212(2J\u22123) , . . ., E2J\u22123 , E2J\u22121 . This indicates that our pattern of connections\nmust be left-right symmetric in this visualization.\nWe already know that P (2) = 1 and P (4) = 2. At J = 3 and N = 6 it is still easy\nto check that just the following three different possibilities exist,\n{[\u22125, \u22123], [\u22121, 1], [3, 5]} ,\n\n{[\u22125, 5], [\u22123, \u22121], [1, 3]} ,\n13\n\n{[\u22125, 5], [\u22123, 3], [\u22121, 1]} ,\n\n\fi.e., P (6) = 3. This enumeration results not only from the required left-right symmetry but also from the necessary absence of intersections between the individual\nenergy-connection curves.\nElements of the sequence of the counts of the possibilities P (2J) will be now\ngenerated in recurrent manner. Firstly, it is obvious that the number P (N ) of all the\npossible arrangements of the mergers at a given N always incorporates a contribution\nfrom the subset of P (N \u22122) merging patterns which all contain the longest possible\nmerger [\u2212(2J \u22121), 2J \u22121] of the two outermost energies. Let us, therefore, abbreviate\n\nP (N ) \u2212 P (N \u22122) = Q(N ) and, in the analysis of the remaining Q(2J) options, let us\n\ndistinguish between the even and odd J.\n\nIn the former case with J = 2K none of the connections [\u00b1(2J \u2212 1), m] involving\n\none of the outermost energies can ever cross the center of the lattice. We have to\nfix sign m = sign (\u00b1(2J \u2212 1)) \u2261 \u00b11. Thus, the absolute value of the index m,\nskipping always a pair of the levels, will run over the K\u2212plet of the odd integers\n\n2J \u2212 3 = 4K \u2212 3, 2J \u2212 7 = 4(K \u2212 1) \u2212 3, 2J \u2212 11 = 4K \u2212 2 \u2212 3, . . ., 4 \u2212 3 = 1. This\n\nmeans that we may introduce an auxiliary symbol P (0) = 1 and evaluate, recurrently,\nQ(4K) as a sum of K terms at any K. This rule forms our first recurrence relation,\nP (4K) \u2212 P (4K\u22122) =\n\n= P (2K\u22122) * P (0) + P (2K\u22124) * P (4) + P (2K\u22126) * P (8) + . . . + P (2) * P (4K\u22128) + P (0) * P (4K\u22124) .\nIn parallel, the choice of the odd J = 2L + 1 makes the second-longest connections\n[\u00b1(2J \u2212 1), \u00b13] a bit shorter, leaving a two-point gap in the middle of the lattice.\n\nThis means that the sequence of all the connections [\u00b1(2J \u22121), \u00b1n] which involve the\n\noutermost energies will again possess L terms. We arrive at the second recurrence\nrelation,\nP (4L+2) \u2212 P (4L) =\n\n= P (2L\u22122) * P (2) + P (2L\u22124) * P (6) + P (2L\u22126) * P (10) + . . . + P (2) * P (4L\u22126) + P (0) * P (4L\u22122) .\nThe latter two recurrences are mutually coupled. Their numerical solution is straightforward, with a sample given in Table 1. Some of its properties are really remarkable.\nFor example, empirically one finds out that the first eight (!) elements of the sequence\nP (2J) coincide with certain binomial coefficients. For the next eight elements of this\nsequence, moreover, one still finds another unexpected regularity in the differences\nR(K)\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\uf8f9\n\n2K\n1\n\uf8f8\uf8fb ,\n= \uf8f0P (4K) \u2212 \uf8ed\n2\nK\n\nS (K)\n\n14\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\uf8f9\n\n2K + 1\n1\n\uf8f8\uf8fb\n= \uf8f0P (4K+2) \u2212 \uf8ed\n4\nK\n\n\fTable 1: Multiplicities P (N ) of the merging patterns\n\nP\n\nK\n\n0 1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n(4 K)\n\n1 2\n\n6\n\n20\n\n68\n\n234\n\n808\n\n2798\n\n9700\n\nP (4 K+2)\nR(K)\nR\n\n(K)\n\n\u2212S\n\n(K)\n\n9\n\n...\n\n33656 . . .\n\n1 3 10\n\n35 122 426 1484 5167 17974 62498 . . .\n\n0 0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n9\n\n58\n\n317\n\n1585\n\n7482\n\n...\n\n0 0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n12\n\n...\n\n(cf.

Indeed, these operators only rarely enable\nus to suppress the well known robust mathematical stability of the spectra when\nthey are chosen as manifestly Hermitian.\nOf course, the removal of the Hermiticity (in the narrow sense of the invariance\nwith respect to the matrix transposition and complex conjugation) does not lead to\nany conflict with the postulates of Quantum Mechanics. On the contrary, it enables\nus to make the models more flexible and more amenable to a direct control of the\nmechanism of the complexification of the eigenvalues.\nIn a way related to the simplicity of our examples another key merit of them can\nbe seen in the nontriviality of the related metric \u0398 6= I which can (and does) vary\nwith the parameters. As long as the flexibility of the physics is directly encoded in \u0398,\none can conclude that the access to the onset and/or breakdown of the observability\nshould be mediated by the selection of the \"decisive\" parameters.\nWe did not mention many other merits of our models (like, e.g., the particular\nadvantages of their PT \u2212symmetry, etc) because the arguments in this direction may\n\nbe found elsewhere [4]. For compensation, let us finally note that the present outline\n\n15\n\n\fof some properties of the quasi-Hermiticity domains could be understood, in some\nsense, as the first steps towards the formulation of a certain quantum analogue of\nthe Thom's theory of catastrophes [31].\n\nAcknowledgement\nCorrespondence and discussion partnership of Hendrik B.
