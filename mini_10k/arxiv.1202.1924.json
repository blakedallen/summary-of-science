The\nmost compelling candidates for dark matter are Weakly\nInteracting Massive Particles (WIMPs) that arise naturally in several models of physics beyond the Standard\nModel [1, 2].\nWIMPs may be directly detected through the energy\ndeposited by a recoiling nucleus following a rare WIMP\nscatter with standard matter. Given the kinematics, the\nrecoil would generate an extremely small signal of <100\nkeVnr (keV nuclear recoil) requiring detectors to exhibit\ngood sensitivity (high detection efficiency) at low energies (down to a few keVnr ) with good energy resolution to\ndetermine the WIMP energy spectrum and estimate the\nWIMP mass. Simultaneously such an ideal detector must\nhave good rejection power for background events from \u03b3rays. Despite this, the experimental sensitivities of direct\nsearches are now entering into the theoretically favored\nparameter space and a positive detection may be imminent from current or next generation devices. Two-phase\nnoble liquid time projection chambers (TPCs) offer particularly attractive prospects for dark matter detection\nthrough excellent background rejection capability, 3D position sensitivity allowing definition of a fiducial volume,\nand cost-effective scalability [3\u201312]. Liquid xenon (LXe)\nin particular offers perhaps the most promising prospect\n\n\u2217 Corresponding\n\nauthor\nEmail address: pbeltrame@physics.ucla.edu (P. Beltrame)\n\nfor unambiguous detection: it is intrinsically radio-pure,\nhas the capability of powerful self-shielding [13\u201315], and\nis sensitive to low energy nuclear recoils. The background\nrejection power of two-phase TPCs comes from the ability\nto record both direct scintillation light (S1) and electroluminescence from ionization (S2) of the target following\nan energy deposition. The ratio of the signal strength\nin these channels differs for electron and nuclear recoil\ninteractions, allowing efficient discrimination between incident particle species.\nTraditionally the nuclear recoil energy scale for LXe\nTPCs with photomultiplier (PMT) read-out is set with\nthe prompt primary scintillation channel S1. However,\nthis channel is dominated by statistical fluctuations in\nsignal generation and detection that ultimately preclude\na direct mapping from observed S1 to recoil energy. Although sufficient for setting limits on WIMP-nucleon\ncross-sections where no signal is observed, the S1 energy\nscale severely limits the ability of a LXe TPC to test\nany possible observed signal excess against the WIMP\nhypothesis through analysis of the energy spectrum and\nevent distribution. Furthermore, the requirement of S1\nsignal across multiple PMTs imposes a relatively high\nenergy threshold. In attempts to circumvent such limitations, an alternative approach is based on the ionization\nS2 channel alone. Although allowing a considerably lower\nthreshold with sensitivity down to single electrons and\na superior energy resolution due to electroluminescence\ngain in the gas phase, the ability to discriminate background is lost and, in the absence of a prompt S1, the\n3D vertex identification is compromised. Furthermore,\nsignificant background (from, for e.g., VUV photoionization [16, 17]) may limit the sensitivity of such S2-only\nanalyses.\nIn an effort to retain the discrimination power and fiducialization capability of the LXe TPC whilst simultaneously exploiting the low energy threshold and superior\n\n\f2\nresolution afforded to the ionization channel, the adoption of a new data analysis method is proposed here. It\nis shown that the traditional representation of data in\nlog10 (S2/S1) vs. S1 phase space can be replaced with\nlog10 (S1/C2) vs. C2 (where C2 is the ionization yield)\nwith no increase in background but with significant improvement in energy resolution allowing reduction in the\nuncertainty in conversion to true recoil energy. This new\ntechnique, whilst retaining all the benefits of the LXe\nTPC technology such as self-shielding through fiducial\ndefinition and particle species discrimination, allows the\ndirect conversion to an energy on an event-by-event basis.\nProposed combined (scintillation and ionization) nuclear\nrecoil energy scales [18\u201320] are still affected by the poor\nresolution in the S1 channel for low energy recoils, whilst\nC2 represents a more appropriate energy scale.\nThis article is organized as follows. In Section II the\ntraditional energy estimator, S1, and the ionization channel, C2, are contrasted and modeled. Limitations of S1\nas the energy scale are highlighted, and C2 shown to provide superior energy resolution and lower detector energy\nthreshold for Xe. In Section III the log10 (S2/S1) vs. S1\nand log10 (S1/C2) vs. C2 phase spaces are examined with\nthe aid of a simple yet realistic model and monoenergetic\nneutrons. This illustrates the inefficiency in signal acceptance, especially at higher energies, and misrepresentation of energy in the traditional phase space. Appropriate signal acceptance regions, with clear energy thresholds that need not exploit smearing of sub-threshold energy depositions into signal regions, are defined in the\nlog10 (S1/C2) vs. C2 phase space. The log10 (E1/E2) vs.\nE2 phase-space is then introduced - these quantities are\nno longer detector specific and accessible as recoil energy\nfor direct comparisons with other technologies. Finally,\nthe response of the model detector to WIMPs is examined in light of the new phase-space.\n\nII.\nA.\n\ntracted from the liquid surface and travel through the\ngas phase, causing electroluminescence and giving a secondary scintillation signal (S2). The conversion from C2\nto S2 is detector dependent - related to the gas gap and\nelectric field configuration of the detector - it is simply\nthe number of photoelectrons per electron extracted into\nthe gas phase. For this reason C2, as the more meaningful parameter, is used as the primary observable rather\nthan S2 throughout this article.\n\nFIG. 1: Diagram of the production of excitation (S1) and ionization (C2, and subsequent S2) signals in 2-phase liquid/gas\ndetectors (adapted from [21]).\n\nUsing S1 as the primary nuclear recoil energy estimator\nappears to suffer from three fundamental difficulties:\n1. The S1 signal is extremely small: typically a fraction of single photoelectron (PE) per keV at energies below 10 keVnr .\n\nNUCLEAR RECOIL ENERGY SCALE\n\nS1 and C2 as nuclear recoil energy estimators\n\nFig. 1 illustrates the mechanism by which two-phase\nLXe TPCs record both the so-called S1 and S2 signals\nfollowing an interaction in the target volume. Energy deposition in LXe leaves atoms in both excited and ionized\nstates. Excited Xe atoms combine with un-excited Xe\natoms in a matter of a few picoseconds to form an excited\nXe\u22172 molecule. The de-excitation of this molecule releases\nultraviolet photons. Simultaneously, ionized Xe atoms\ncombine with non-ionized atoms to form Xe+2 molecules.\nIn the absence of an electric field, these recombine with\nelectrons to form an excited Xe\u2217\u2217 atom that emits ultraviolet photons through de-excitation (S1). In the presence of an electric field, not all the free electrons are\nable to recombine with the ionized Xe molecule and are\ndrifted up to the liquid/gas interface. Under a strong\nenough electric field, these free electrons (C2) are ex-\n\n2. Conversion from S1 to nuclear recoil energy, Enr\ndepends on several parameters, given in Eq. 1:\n\nEnr =\n\nS1 1 Snr\n,\nLy Leff See\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Snr and See describe the electric field suppression factors for nuclear and electron recoils, respectively, Ly is the detector light yield, and Leff\nis the scintillation yield for nuclear recoils.\nFirst the absolute Ly calibration point is given by\n122 keVee (keV electron equivalent) 57 Co \u03b3-rays.\nSecond, the difference between field dependent detector response to \u03b3-rays and nuclear recoils must\nbe accounted for (Snr and See ). Finally, the energy\ndependence of the scintillation yield for nuclear recoils is corrected by Leff (shown in Fig. 2).\n\n\fQY\n\n3. Leff is suppressed at lower energies, resulting in\npoorer energy measurements due to a lack of photoelectron statistics.\n\nekeVnr\n\n3\n\n1.0 kV/cm Manzur et al. 2010\n4.0 kV/cm Manzur et al. 2010\n0.10 kV/cm Aprile et al. 2006\n0.27 kV/cm Aprile et al. 2006\n2.0 kV/cm Aprile et al. 2006\n2.3 kV/cm Aprile et al. 2006\n\n10\n\nIt is well known that such extrapolation (from 122\nkeVee \u03b3-rays to a few keVnr neutrons) and conversions\ntend to propagate large systematic errors at each stage.\nIn other words, this is a so-called 'piece-by-piece' calibration, in opposition to ideal 'end-to-end' calibrations\nthat tend to cancel out systematic errors. The investigation presented here indicates that the ionization yield,\nC2, can act as a much improved energy estimator for the\nfollowing three reasons:\n1. The yield of C2 is an order of magnitude larger:\ntypically \u223c5 electrons per keVnr .\n2.

Theoretical models and dedicated measurements\nindicate that the value of Qy increases with decreasing energy, meaning that even at low energy,\nlarge C2 signals are expected.\n\nB.\n\nModeling S1 and C2 signals\n\nIn order to perform a further systematic comparison,\na model is constructed using Monte Carlo simulations.\nThe underlying, well-motivated assumptions [26, 27, 29\u2013\n32] are as follows:\n\u2022 The energy dependence of Leff and Qy is as shown\nin Figs. 2 & 3, respectively.\n\nLeff\n\n\u2022 Ly = 3 PE/keVee at 122 keVee .\n\u2022 Snr and See are chosen assuming an electric field of\n0.5 kV/cm.\n\n0.5\nArneodo 2000\n\n0.45\n\n\u2022 For conversion from S2 to C2, the secondary scintillation gain in a gas phase is assumed to be 20 (i.e.,\nS2 = C2 \u00d7 20), with negligible variation across the\nsurface of any fiducial volume.\n\nBernabei 2001\n\n0.4\n\nAkimov 2002\nAprile 2005\n\n0.35\n\nChepel 2006\nAprile 2009\n\n0.3\n\nManzur 2010\n\n0.25\n\nPlante 2011\n\n\u2022 Poisson distribution for S1 in terms of the number\nof photoelectrons.\n\nHorn 2011\n\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n1\n\n10\n\n102\nEnergy [keVnr]\n\nFIG. 2: Collection of all direct measurements of Leff to\ndate [22\u201326]. In this diagram, the solid grey regions represent a Maximum Likelihood fit to all direct measurements\nand the associated 1\u03c3 and 2\u03c3 confidence bands; this parameterization is adopted in this work and is taken from [10]. Leff\nis extrapolated to zero at 1 keVnr . In addition, a contemporaneous indirect (data vs. Monte Carlo) measurement [27] is\nshown to be in good agreement with direct measurements.\n\n\u2022 Poisson distribution for C2 in terms of the number\nof free electrons from initial ionization.\nAt this stage new terminology may be introduced: 'E1'\nas the energy estimated by S1, and 'E2' as the energy\nestimated by C2. The dominant source of the energy\nmis-measurement is the Poisson fluctuations in S1 in the\ncase of E1, and in C2 for the case of E2. It should be\nnoted that any other factors such as the secondary scintillation process from C2 to S2 have a negligible contribution. E2 by itself represents a better estimate of the\nenergy than the combination of E1 and E2 (as adopted\nfor electromagnetic interactions of \u226b10 keVee ) due to the\npoor photoelectron statistics of S1.\n\n\f4\nFig. 4 shows the simple relationship between S1, C2\nand nuclear recoil energy. Here three different cases,\nLy = 2, 3, & 5 PE/keVee , are shown for S1. For a given\nenergy, C2 is an order of magnitude larger than S1, and\nthe advantage of C2 over S1 grows for lower energies.\nFig. 5 shows the energy resolution (\u03c3/E) of E1 and E2.\nHere again the three cases of Ly = 2, 3, & 5 PE/keVee\nare presented. Even with Ly as large as 5 PE/keVee , E1\nbecomes severely limited below \u223c10 keVnr .

S2 vs. S1\nII. log10 (S2/S1) vs. S1\nIII. log10 (S1/C2) vs. C2\n\nCounts\n\nIV. log10 (E1/E2) vs. E2\nRecall that S1 is analytically connected to E1 by Leff ,\nwhile C2 is analytically connected to E2 by Qy . Thus\nthere exists a strict one-to-one mapping between all four\nphase spaces listed.\n\nC2 [e]\nS1 [PE] (2 PE/keV)\n\n102\n\nS1 [PE] (3 PE/keV)\nS1 [PE] (5 PE/keV)\n\nA.\n\n10\n\n1\n1\n\n102\nEr [keVnr]\n\n10\n\n\u03c3E/E\n\nFIG. 4: S1, for three different detector light yields, and C2\nobservables as a function of nuclear recoil energy. S1 is shown\nin units of PE, whereas C2 is in electrons (i.e., prior to amplification to S2).\n\nMonoenergetic nuclear recoil injection\n\nAs a simple illustration of these phase spaces, we first\ninject monoenergetic nuclear recoil energies of 4, 8, 16\nand 32 keVnr . Such energies are representative of the\nrange of interest for WIMP scatters in LXe. Typically detectors are calibrated with broad spectrum sources such\nas Am-Be or 252 Cf neutron emitters that produce recoils\nacross this energy range. Note that the results are of\ncourse unaffected for the case of continuous spectra.\nFirstly, Fig. 6 shows S2 vs. S1. Here, as well as\nthroughout the article, the following are indicated:\n\u2022 For each of the sets of monoenergetic energy recoils,\n1\u03c3 and 2\u03c3 regions are shown as contours.\n\u2022 A black solid curve indicates E2 = E1. Additional\n\u00b11\u03c3 and \u00b12\u03c3 curves show the band of continuous\nnuclear recoil energy distribution (as from, for e.g.,\nAm-Be neutron calibration data).\n\n1\n\n\u2022 E1 = 4, 8, 16, 32 keVnr are indicated with green\nlines, while E2 = 4, 8, 16, 32 keVnr are indicated\nwith blue lines.\n\n0.9\n0.8\nEr from S1 (2 PE/keV)\n\n0.7\n\nEr from S1 (3 PE/keV)\n\n0.6\n\nEr from S1 (5 PE/keV)\nEr from C2\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n1\n\n10\n\n102\nEr [keVnr]\n\nFIG. 5: Energy resolution as a function of recoil energy for\nan energy scale determined using S1 (for three different light\nyields) and C2. Above \u223c40 keVnr , the resolutions become\ncomparable but at lower recoil energies, of relevance to WIMP\nsearches, the advantage of a C2 derived energy scale is evident.\n\nIt is clearly seen that at lower energy the S1 distribution is much wider than the S2 distribution, highlighting the fact that S2 is the better energy estimator. At\n4 keVnr , S1 is only 2 PE, thus its Poisson fluctuation\nprohibits any useful energy estimate.\nNext, Fig. 7 shows the traditional phase space of\nlog10 (S2/S1) vs. S1 for the monoenergetic recoils. It\nis seen that the recoils are distributed in an elongated\nellipse for any given energy. The ellipses are aligned with\ncontours of constant E2 because E2 represents the nuclear recoil energy with less spread (and ambiguity) than\nS1. It is evident that this phase space is distorted, and\nthus introduces a corresponding distortion to the value\nenergy calculated by a measurement of S1.\nFig. 8 introduces the new phase space of log10 (S1/C2)\nvs. C2. Unlike in the log10 (S2/S1) vs. S1 phase space\n\n\f5\n\nE1 = 4 keV nr 8 keVnr\n\nLog(S2/S1)\n\n(Fig. 7), each energy band is now well aligned as a vertical ellipse. Note that they are still well separated,\nas in Fig. 6 showing S2 vs. S1. Note also the simple relation log10 (S1/C2) = log10 (S1/(S2/20)) = 1.30\n- log10 (S2/S1). Therefore the y-axis of this new phase\nspace, log10 (S1/C2), is merely a mathematical transformation of log10 (S2/S1). The critical advantage of this\nmethod comes from adopting the new x-axis of C2 instead S1, whilst retaining discrimination.\n\n16 keVnr\n\n32 keVnr\n\n3.2\n3\n2.8\n2.6\n2.4\n2.2\n2\n\n8 keVnr\n\n16 keVnr\n\n1.8\n\n32 keVnr\n\nS2 [PE]\n\nE1 = 4 keV nr\n\n32 keVnr\n\n1.6\nE2 = 4 keV nr\n\n32 keVnr\n\n8 keVnr\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n16 keVnr\n\n103\n8 keVnr\n\n4 keVnr\nE2\n\n10\n\nS1 [PE]\n\nFIG. 6: The relationship between S1 and S2 for monoenergetic nuclear recoils of 4, 8, 16, and 32 keVnr .

Green lines (vertical here) indicate\nenergy in E1 and blue lines (horizontal here) indicate energy\nin E2. Note that the same convention is used throughout this\narticle. It is clear that the Poisson fluctuations in S1 gives a\ngreater distortion for lower recoil energies making an energy\nscale determined by S1 significantly more ambiguous as true\nrecoil energy gets lower.\n\n40\nS1 [PE]\n\nFIG. 7: The distribution of monoenergetic nuclear recoils as\nshown in traditional log10 (S2/S1) vs. S1 parameter space.\nThe distortion of what has been previously used to represent\na recoil energy scale is seen.

Fig. 10 depicts the superior energy resolution\nof the E2 phase space.\n\u2022 log10 (E1/E2) = 0 (i.e., E2 = E1) sets the mean\nfor all the nuclear recoil events, in the absence of\nimposed thresholds.\n\u2022 Experimental specific calibrations are incorporated\ninto the only physically meaningful parameters, E2\n(energy) and E1/E2 (discrimination); this phase\nspace is not specific to any single detector.\n\nFIG. 8: The monoenergetic nuclear recoils represented in the\nlog10 (S1/C2) vs. C2 phase space. Transposed onto the C2\nscale, the ambiguity of the conversion between an observable\nand a recoil energy is significantly reduced, with no loss of\ndiscrimination.\n\nB.\n\nRepresenting the traditional signal box\n\nTo further evaluate the benefits and disadvantages of\nthe four different phase spaces, let us now consider a\n'signal box' for a WIMP search.

The maximum energy of 32 keVnr is indicated in\nE1 as a vertical line in the traditional log10 (S2/S1)\nvs. S1 phase space. However, only a very small\nfraction of 32 keVnr events are actually accepted\nby the signal box (see Fig. 13).\n2. At the minimum energy of 8 keVnr , the bound is\nrather loose towards low energy events. There are\nsome fraction of events between 4 and 8 keVnr that\npenetrate into the signal box. This is the origin of\nthe so-called 'Poisson smearing' that enhances the\nsensitivity of such detectors to low energy events,\nand thus to low mass (<10 GeV/c2 ) WIMPs whilst\nmaintaining a relatively high threshold (8 keVnr in\nthis model). Here some fraction of events that deposit energies below threshold may be detected in\nthe signal region following statistical fluctuations\nin the number of detected PE.\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nFIG. 10: Comparison of 8 keVnr and 16 keVnr nuclear recoil\nenergy spectra in E1 (top) and E2 (bottom), highlighting the\nsuperior energy resolution in E2 that improves relative to E1\nfor falling energies.\n\nIt is worth noting that the traditional signal region\nshows up as quite a distorted box in both log10 (S1/C2)\nvs. C2 and log10 (E1/E2) vs. E2, as shown in Fig. 11.\n\nC.\n\nIntroduction of a new signal box\n\nTo address the fact that E1 is not a good energy estimator, a new signal box, based on E2, is defined. In the\ncase of E2, the energy can be well determined even down\nto the 2 \u2013 3 keVnr range. Therefore, there is no reason to\ndefine a lower bound at 8 keVnr (which is necessary in the\ncase of the E1-based phase space to ensure good signal\nacceptance at threshold). Instead, a minimum energy of\n4 keVnr (close to the lowest directly measured relative\nscintillation and ionization yield values) is introduced in\nthis model. The signal box that is proposed is shown in\n\n\f7\n\n16 keVnr\n\n32 keVnr\n\nS2 [PE]\n\n8 keVnr\n\n32 keVnr\n\nLog(S2/S1)\n\nE1 = 4 keV nr 8 keVnr\n\nE1 = 4 keV nr\n\n16 keVnr\n\n32 keVnr\n\n3.2\n3\n2.8\n2.6\n\n16 keVnr\n\n2.4\n\n103\n8 keVnr\n\n2.2\n2\n\n4 keVnr\n\n1.8\n32 keVnr\n\nE2\n\n1.6\nE2 = 4 keV nr\n\n8 keVnr\n\n16 keVnr\n\n1.4\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n10\n\nE2 = 4 keV nr\n\n8 keVnr\n\n16 keVnr\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nS1 [PE]\n\nE2 = 4 keV nr 8 keVnr\n\n32 keVnr\n\nLog(E1/E2)\n\nLog(S1/C2)\n\n1\n\n0\n\n16 keVnr\n\n40\nS1 [PE]\n\n32 keVnr\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n\n-0.5\n\n0.2\n0\n32 keVnr\n\n-1\n\n16 keVnr\n\n32 keVnr\n\n-0.2\n16 keVnr\n\n-0.4\n8 keVnr\n\n-1.5\n\n-0.6\n\n-2\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n8 keVnr\n\n-0.8\n\nE1 = 4 keV nr\n\nE1 = 4 keV nr\n\n180\n\n200\nC2 [e]\n\n-1\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n50\nE2 [keVnr]\n\nFIG. 11: The traditional signal box (pink boundaries) as defined in log10 (S2/S1) vs. S1 and applied to the four phase spaces\ndescribed in the text. It can be seen that WIMP recoil acceptance at 4 and 32 keVnr is severely reduced in relation to that\nsuggested in the S1 space once the box is transposed into the C2 or E2 energy scales.\n\nFig. 12 as a red box in all four phase spaces and is defined\nby:\n\u2022 E2 range between 4 and 32 keVnr .\n\u2022 The region between the mean and 2\u03c3 of the neutron\nband in log10 (S1/C2) vs. C2 or log10 (E1/E2) vs.\nE2.\nTo further illustrate the effect of minimum and maximum energy bounds in the old and new methods, the\nsignal acceptance is shown as a function of true recoil\nenergy in Fig. 13. The new signal box shows a near flat\nacceptance in energy from 4 \u2013 32 keVnr , whilst an E1based signal region compromises efficiency both at low\nand high energies.\nAs a final extension to the issue of signal box definition, it should be noted that in the phase space of\nlog10 (E1/E2) vs. E2, a sharp lower energy bound at\n\n4 keVnr is unnecessary. Assuming extrapolation of models for relative scintillation and ionization yields to lower\nenergies, or in light of future direct measurements elucidating this region, a lower bound that follows the minimum contour of 2 PE in the S1 channel may be adopted.\nSimilarly, there is no reason to set a higher energy bound.\nIndeed, a profile likelihood analysis across the 2D phase\nspace of log10 (E1/E2) vs. E2 allows improved background rejection and signal excess energy distribution\nanalysis as a result of the improved resolution. Such a\nmaximally efficient signal region is presented in Fig. 14.\n\nD.\n\nWIMP spectra injection\n\nAs the final stage of this investigation, injection of\nWIMP energy spectra are simulated.\nFor illustration purposes a WIMP mass of 100 GeV/c2 is assumed with a spin-independent WIMP-nucleon interac-\n\n\f8\n\n16 keVnr\n\n32 keVnr\n\nS2 [PE]\n\n8 keVnr\n\n32 keVnr\n\nLog(S2/S1)\n\nE1 = 4 keV nr 8 keVnr\n\nE1 = 4 keV nr\n\n16 keVnr\n\n32 keVnr\n\n3.2\n3\n2.8\n2.6\n\n16 keVnr\n\n2.4\n\n103\n8 keVnr\n\n2.2\n2\n\n4 keVnr\n\n1.8\n32 keVnr\n\nE2\n\n1.6\nE2 = 4 keV nr\n\n8 keVnr\n\n16 keVnr\n\n1.4\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n10\n\nE2 = 4 keV nr\n\n8 keVnr\n\n16 keVnr\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nS1 [PE]\n\nE2 = 4 keV nr 8 keVnr\n\n32 keVnr\n\nLog(E1/E2)\n\nLog(S1/C2)\n\n1\n\n0\n\n16 keVnr\n\n40\nS1 [PE]\n\n32 keVnr\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n\n-0.5\n\n0.2\n0\n32 keVnr\n\n-1\n\n16 keVnr\n\n32 keVnr\n\n-0.2\n16 keVnr\n\n-0.4\n8 keVnr\n\n-1.5\n\n-0.6\n\n-2\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n8 keVnr\n\n-0.8\n\nE1 = 4 keV nr\n\nE1 = 4 keV nr\n\n180\n\n200\nC2 [e]\n\n-1\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n50\nE2 [keVnr]\n\nFIG. 12: A new signal box (red boundaries) is defined in log10 (E1/E2) v E2 phase space and applied to the four phase spaces\ndescribed in the text. Applying this box into traditional phase space of log10 (S2/S1) vs. S1 serves to highlight the huge\ndistortion present in the traditional method of signal box definition and analysis. The C2 and E2 energy scales also allow\nmeasurements of discrimination parameters and estimation of background leakage into the signal region from slices in C2\nspecific to a given energy.\n\ntion cross-section of 5\u00d710\u221245 cm2 . An exposure of 1 year\nfor a 1 ton fiducial mass is considered. Fig. 15 shows\nthe WIMP recoil event distributions in the traditional\nlog10 (S2/S1) vs. S1 phase space and signal box as previously defined in the S1 energy estimator scale (as in\nFig. 11). Fig. 16 shows the same WIMP event distribution in log10 (E1/E2) vs. E2 with the signal box as defined\nwith a lower threshold dictated only by the 2 PE requirement for S1 (as in Fig. 14). The lower energy threshold\nfrom the E2 scale and signal box bounded only by the S1\nthreshold naturally results in significantly greater signal\nacceptance for WIMPs, whilst maintaining discrimination: of order 500 events are observed as compared to\napproximately 300 for the traditional box.\nFurthermore, with the E2 energy scale, given appropriate statistics, the new representation may expose\nan exponential energy spectrum with a WIMP mass-\n\ndependent slope with greater confidence than the traditional S1 energy scale. This has an important consequence on the discovery of WIMPs. The new method\nof log10 (E1/E2) vs. E2 allows investigation of not only\nthe excess of events over expected background, but also\nthe energy spectrum of these events and determination\nof WIMP mass.\n\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nA.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe new concept of log10 (E1/E2) vs. E2 as a replacement of the current standard of log10 (S2/S1) vs. S1 has\nbeen introduced based on Monte Carlo simulations of\na theoretically motivated and detector realistic model.\n\n\f9\n\nLog(E1/E2)\n\nAccept.

Demanding\ncoherence across all four types of phase space, systematic\ncomparison between data and Monte Carlo simulations\nwill allow considerably more robust estimates of nuclear\nrecoil acceptance, as well as verification of assumptions\nin the energy dependence of Leff and Qy .\nOne should note, however, that the most reliable tests\nof such models could be performed by direct calibration\nof dark matter detectors in situ, using monoenergetic\nneutron generators, very much in the same manner as\ndedicated Leff measurements.\nWith well modeled neutron calibration data, reproduced by simulation across all phase spaces, the detection\nefficiency can be reliably measured down to very low energy. Provided background remains negligible, the lowest possible energy threshold in both S1 and C2 can be\nadopted. Although for C2 this could be as low as several\nelectrons (\u223ckeVnr ), assuming sufficient electron mobility\nin the liquid, the minimum requirement of S1 = 2 PE\nnonetheless dominates.\nThe proposed approach also has consequence for background expectation analysis.

Here no upper boundary is imposed, and the lower boundary is defined by the S1 = 2 PE\ncoincidence requirement. Acceptance to WIMP recoils is thus\nenhanced.

The lower\nthreshold afforded this signal box increases the efficiency at\nlower energies. Indeed, contingent upon the behavior of electromagnetic background, in principle the lower bound may be\ncompletely removed and the threshold defined simply as the\nminimum requirement of 2 PE (i.e., 1 PE in 2 PMTs). No\nupper bound need be enforced at all. This is represented by\nthe solid red curve.\n\n5\n\n16 keVnr\n\n32 keVnr\n\n3.2\n3\n2.8\n2.6\n277 Obs.

Partial scintillation (S1', E1')\nmay be detected from such 'inactive' volumes whereas\nno electrons are extracted into the gas phase meaning\nno ionization signal. Such events appear with artificially\nlarge S1 signals (from both interaction sites) relative to\nthe ionization signal (from a single site) and leak towards\nthe neutron band. In the traditional phase space this\ncauses a distortion in both the y-axis, log10 (S2/S1), and\nx-axis, S1, such that:\n[log10 (S2/S1), S1] \u2192 [log10 (S2/(S1 + S1\u2032 )), (S1 + S1\u2032 )]\nIn the new space only the y-axis is affected:\n[log10 (E1/E2), E2] \u2192 [log10 ((E1 + E1\u2032 )/E2), E2]\nThe result is that the MSSI events produce a flat distribution in the E2 phase space that is more readily characterised.\nThe consequences of the new approach on the electron recoil rejection is being explored by developing a\nsimilar model of (S1, C2) observable signals from \u03b3-rays.\nHowever it is clear that such an approach (translating to\ndifferent phase spaces) cannot introduce any additional\nbackground events to a signal box - every event in any of\nthe four phase spaces can be mapped to any other phase\nspace. The number of background events in one phase\nspace remains exactly the same in any other.\n\nB.\n\nConclusions\n\nTraditionally, nuclear recoil energy for WIMP searches\nby liquid Xe dual-phase TPCs has been estimated by\nmeans of the initial scintillation and not by the ionization charge. The secondary scintillation is exploited only\nas a discrimination parameter in log10 (S2/S1) vs. S1.\nAlternative approaches that use only the S2 channel seriously damage the discrimination power and 3D event\nvertex information.\nThis article has presented issues with the traditional\napproach, primarily due to the fluctuations in S1 signal\nthat do not allow reliable determination of the true recoil energy. Additionally, the acceptance when defined\nin S1 does not translate to the assumed nuclear recoil\nenergy, causing efficiency loss even towards the higher\nenergy boundary of the signal box.\nTo address these problems, the new phase space of\nlog10 (S1/C2) vs. C2 has been introduced using C2 as\nthe superior energy estimator. Crucially, the improved\nresolution can be exploited without loss of fiducialization (critical to liquid noble gas TPCs for self-shielding\nand event reconstruction) or discrimination (critical in\nrejecting single scatter electronic background).\nFinally, two energy estimators are defined (E1 from\nS1, and E2 from C2), and log10 (E1/E2) vs. E2 is introduced. Advantages of this approach may be summarized\nas follows:\n1. The energy resolution from E2 is considerably enhanced relative to the E1, especially at low energies\nwhere the WIMP spectrum peaks. This provides\nimprovement in evaluating the WIMP energy spectrum against the background.\n2. Lower energy thresholds and greater signal acceptance can be achieved without compromizing selfshielding or discrimination power.\n3. Monte Carlo simulation models of neutron calibrations can be assessed in multiple phase spaces to\naddress underlying assumptions and nuclear recoil\nefficiency can be uniquely extracted.\n4. For a given E2 bin, log10 (E1/E2) represents an electronic rejection parameter specific to that energy.\n5. With multiple WIMP events observed the WIMP\nmass can be estimated with greater confidence.\n\n\f11\nIn conclusion, the proposed method of log10 (E1/E2)\nvs. E2 is more accurate and reliable than the traditional\nmethod of log10 (S2/S1) vs. S1. E1 and E2 are presented\nas more accessible detector independent parameters that\ncan be adopted within the dark matter search community\nand directly compared with other technologies.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n\nG.
