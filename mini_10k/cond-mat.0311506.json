Growth morphology has been found to depend on the deposition rate and growth temperature. For\nAg deposition on Si(111)-(7\u00d77) at low temperature (LT),\nreflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) oscillations were observed up to many monolayers (MLs)\nindicating a quasi-layer-by-layer growth [1, 2]. Scanning\ntunneling microscopy (STM) studies on such samples also\nindicated quasi-layer-by-layer growth up to 3.6 ML, attributed to a lower average island size and higher island\ndensity compared to room temperature (RT) growth [3].\nAt RT deposition it is generally accepted that the growth\nfollows the Stranski\u2013Krastanov (SK) or layer-plus-island\ngrowth mode [4, 5, 6, 7]. However, for RT deposition\nquasi-layer-by-layer growth has also been observed but\nonly for high deposition rates (\u223c30 ML/min) [1]. An\nLT growth followed by RT annealing leads to yet another growth mode in which 3D plateaulike Ag islands\nwith a strongly preferred height are observed on a wetting layer [8]. The islands increase their number density\nand lateral extension with coverage with no change in\nheight, eventually forming a percolated network of the\nsame preferred height. This behavior was observed where\n1 ML to a maximum of 2.2 ML deposition was studied\n[8]. This growth mode is different from the conventional\nSK growth mode. The role of electronic driving force\nhas been suggested to be responsible for this mode of\ngrowth. Zhang and coworkers proposed the electronic\ngrowth mechanism, in which uniform layer can be grown\n\n\u2217 Present address: Paul Scherrer Institute, CH-5232 Villigen PSI,\nSwitzerland.\n\u2020 Electronic address: bhupen@iopb.res.in\n\nonly over a thickness window, below or above which the\nmetal film would be nonuniform [9, 10]. According to\ntheir work, very thin films are destabilized by charge\ntransfer at the interface, films of intermediate thickness\nare stabilized by quantum confinement and thick films\nare destabilized by stress. Huang et al studied Ag growth\non Si(111)-(7\u00d77) at 50 K followed by annealing at 300\nK [11]. By STM measurements they observed that flat\npin-hole free films can be grown where the amount of\nmaterial deposited exceeds 6 ML but multilayer pits are\nobserved for thinner films. Growth at 300 K was found\nto produce three dimensional structures. These authors\ndid not explore much higher film thicknesses to find out\nif there exists a thickness window above which the film\nagain becomes nonuniform. To explore this aspect films\nof higher thicknesses are to be studied. The authors of\nref. [11] studied only a maximum thickness of 6.4 ML.\nMoreover, at RT growth whether plateaulike islands with\na strongly preferred height are formed, as observed by\nGavoli et al. [8] for LT deposition and RT annealing, has\nnot been explored. In their study the thinnest Ag film on\nSi(111)-(7\u00d77) grown at 300 K was 5 ML. Thinner films\nare to be studied to reveal any plateaulike islands with a\nheight preference.\nHere we report on our studies of growth of Ag films\nover a wide range of thickness on Si(111)-(7 \u00d7 7) surfaces for RT growth as well as RT growth plus annealing\nat higher temperatures by STM, transmission electron\nmicroscopy (TEM) and high resolution x-ray diffraction\n(HRXRD) experiments. Encouraged by the fact that for\nother metal/Si systems LT [12] as well as RT [13] deposition shows growth of islands with preferred heights as\na consequence of quantum size effect (QSE), we explore\nwhether a height preference exists for the growth of Ag on\nSi over a range of thicknesses for RT growth. Indeed we\nobserve growth of plateaulike Ag islands with an N-layer\n(N even) height preference. These aspects alongwith the\ndetailed morphology and strain in annealed films are pre-\n\n\f2\nsented here.\n\nB\n\nA\n\n(a)\n10\n5\n0\n\n0\n\n200 400 600\n\nIntensity [arb. units]\n\n600\n\n(b)\n\n500\n\nA\n\n400\n\n\u2206N = 2\n\n300\n200\n\nB\n\n100\n0\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nRelative Height [\u00c5]\nFIG. 1: (a) STM image (700\u00d7700 \u00c52 ) of a 1 ML Ag film deposited on a Si(111)-(7\u00d77) surface at RT. Sample bias voltage\nVs = 2.1 V, tunneling current I = 0.2 nA. Height profile along\nthe line is shown (scales are in \u00c5) (b) Island height distribution obtained from the image in (a), showing the strongly\npreferred height (peak B) corresponding to two atomic layers\nof Ag(111). Peak A represents the Ag wetting layer.\n\ncooled slowly to RT. The (7\u00d77) reconstruction was observed on Si(111) surface by STM. Ag was evaporated\nfrom a Knudsen cell (PBN crucible) and deposited onto\nthe Si(111)-(7\u00d77) surfaces, kept at RT, at the rate of\n2 ML/min. (Some authors have defined a monolayer of\nAg to be equivalent to the normal surface atomic density\nof Ag(111), which is 1.5\u00d71015 atoms/cm2 . Others have\ndefined a monolayer to be the equivalent of the atomic\ndensity on an ideal Si(111) surface, which is 0.78 \u00d71015\natoms/cm2 . Here we use the former definition). For\nthe annealed samples, annealing was performed following deposition in the MBE chamber. During deposition\nthe chamber pressure rose to 8.5\u00d710\u221210 mbar. The sample was then transfered into the VTSTM chamber for\nmicroscopy measurements at RT. Following STM measurements samples were taken out of the UHV chamber\nfor HRXRD and TEM measurements. Film thickness\nwas measured during growth by a quartz microbalance\nas well as post-growth Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) experiments. HRXRD measurements\nwith a rotating anode source and TEM measurements\nwith a JEOL-2010 microscope using 200 keV electrons\nwere made in Institute of Physics. HRXRD measurements were also performed with synchrotron radiation at\nHASYLAB at DESY in Germany at the bending magnet\nbeamline ROEMO-I.\nFor HRXRD measurements with a rotating anode\nsource, we have used Mo K\u03b11 X-rays (\u03bb = 0.709\u00c5)\nmonochromatized by a symmetrically cut Si(111) crystal. For experiments with synchrotron radiation (SR)\na pair of symmetrically cut Ge(111) crystals were used\nin a double-crystal monochromatator. A beam entrance\nslit (S1: vertical opening 70\u03bcm, horizontal opening 0.5\nmm) 46 cm before the sample and another slit(S3: vertical opening 200 \u03bcm) before the detector at a distance\nof 43 cm from the sample were used. An antiscattering\nslit (S2: vertical opening 80 \u03bcm) was used between the\nsample and the entrance slit. During sample alignment\nsmaller vertical opening of the slits were used (S1: 30 \u03bcm,\nS3: 100 \u03bcm). X-rays of a longer wavelength (\u03bb = 1.033\u00c5)\nwere used for the SR experiments.\n\nIII.\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\n\nGrowth and STM measurements were performed in a\ncustom made molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) chamber\ncoupled with an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) variable temperature scanning tunneling microscope (VTSTM, Omicron). This system has been described elsewhere [14].\nBase pressure in the growth chamber was 1\u00d710\u221210 mbar.\nSi(111) samples were cut form n-type silicon wafers with\nresistivity in the range 10\u221220 \u03a9cm. After introducing into the MBE chamber, substrates were degassed\nat 600\u25e6C for about 12 hours. The sample was then\nflashed briefly at 1150\u25e6C to remove the native oxide and\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nA.\n\nGrowth and morphology\n\nFor a thin (1 ML) Ag layer grown on a Si(111)-(7 \u00d7 7)\nsurface at RT, a STM image is shown in Fig.1(a). A\nheight scan along the line marked in Fig.1(a) is shown\nbelow the image. Growth of flat-top islands with a preferential height is evident from the height scan. Indeed all\nthe islands seen in Fig.1(a) have the same height. Height\ndistribution of Ag islands obtained from the micrograph\nin Fig.1(a) is shown in Fig.1(b). The dark background\narea (marked 'A') in Fig.1(a) corresponding to peak A\nin Fig.1(b) is the first Ag wetting layer on Si(111).

A height distribution\nplot obtained from a STM image of a 2 ML film is shown\nin Fig.2. There is a strong tendency of height preference\nin units of bilayer height [N = 2 (A\u2013C), 4 (A\u2013E)]. From\nFig.2 we also notice the existence of monolayer B and\ntrilayer D heights; however, their intensities are smaller.\nThe monolayer height peak B arises from the height difference between C and D, i.e., growth of monolayer height\nislands on the already formed double-layer height islands.\nDirect growth of monolayer height islands on the wetting\nlayer A is very rarely observed. For the growth of 4 ML\nonwards, the Ag layer forms a percolating structure.

Peak A corresponds to the wetting layer\nand B, C, D and E correspond to islands of monolayer, bilayer, trilayer and quadrilayer heights, respectively.

Assuming\nthat the spacing between atomic layers in the Ag islands\nis close to the corresponding value in bulk Ag along the\n[111] direction, each island contains two atomic layers of\nAg. The wetting layer contains about 0.5 ML Ag [8], the\nremaining deposited Ag grows as islands on the wetting\nlayer. So the double-layer height preference of the Ag\nislands is obvious. This height preference of Ag islands\nfor RT growth of Ag on Si(111)-(7 \u00d7 7) surfaces is quite\nrobust. Among several STM images, in one image similar to Fig.1(a), among islands of double-layer height only\none island of a height corresponding to three atomic layers of Ag was found. We observed no Ag islands of one\natomic layer height. The root-mean-square roughness on\nany given island is \u223c0.2 \u00c5 while that obtained from the\nwhole image [Fig.1(a)] is 2.2 \u00c5. The double-layer height\n(5.4 \u00c5) preference of Ag islands for the Ag/Si(111)-(7\u00d77)\nsystem was earlier observed only for LT (150 K) deposition followed by RT (300 K) annealing for deposition\nbetween 1 and 2.2 ML Ag [8].\nThis novel growth mode was qualitatively explained in\nterms of the electronic growth mechanism [9, 10], wherein\nthe quantized electrons in a layer can influence the morphology. As we observe here, for the Ag/Si(111) system\nLT growth followed by RT annealing is not a necessary\ncondition for the formation of islands of preferred heights.\nThey are also formed in RT deposition. Moreover, height\npreferences with larger heights have been observed in\nother metal/silicon systems [12, 13]. We investigated\ngrowth of Ag layers of various thicknesses (1\u221260 ML).\n\nA\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nRelative Height [\u00c5]\nFIG. 3: Height distribution obtained from a STM image (350\n\u00d7850\u00c52 ) of a 5 ML Ag film. N-layer heights of islands (B: N\n= 2, C: N = 4, D: N = 6) for even values of N are strongly\npreferred.\n\nheight distribution from a 5 ML Ag film is shown in Fig.3.\nGrowth of islands of N-layer (N even: 2, 4, 6) height is\nprominent. The peaks A, B, C, D in Fig.3 correspond to\nthe wetting layer, N = 2, N = 4, N = 6 islands. These\nheights are seen in line scans through the STM image\n(not shown). STM images from 20 ML, 30 ML and 40\nML Ag films are shown in Fig.4. The roughness obtained\nfrom the STM image in Fig.4(c) is 6.2 \u00c5, while that only\non the flat features is \u223c 0.2 \u00c5. Small hexagonal islands\nappear to grow on the outer layers beginning around 30\nML thick films. These hexagonal islands become more\nprominent for 40 ML and 60 ML (shown later) films.\nHeight distribution in the 40 ML film is shown in Fig.5.\nHeight preference for even-N is observed. Peak A in Fig.5\nis not from the wetting layer. The wetting layer has been\ncovered by further growth on it. If we assume the height\ncorresponding to A to be N0 -layer then we observe strong\npreference for N0 +2, N0 +4 and N0 +6 layers in Fig.5.\nThese heights can be appreciated from the height scan\nand the grey scale in the marked area in Fig.4(c).

Here the peak A does not corespond to the wetting layer.\nRelative height for a given \u2206N may somewhat depend on the\nvalue of N ( see text for details).\n\nstrates are available. Recently for Pb islands grown on\nSi(111) substrates, Okamoto et al. observed a preference\nfor islands with height differences (\u2206N) equivalent to an\neven number of Pb atomic layers [13]. Surface energy has\nbeen found to be lower for a height containing an even\nnumber of atomic layers, compared to the neighboring\nheights containing an odd number of layers. For Ag films\non Fe(100) surfaces, in general an N-layer film, though\nstable at low temperature, was found to bifurcate into\na film with N\u00b11, i.e. \u2206N=2, around 400 K [15]. Some\ntheoretical attempts have been made to understand the\nN\u2013dependent stability of metal films using the quantization condition (the phase accumulation model):\n2kz (E)N d0 + \u03c61 (E) + \u03c62 (E) = 2n\u03c0\n\n20\n10\n0\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\nFIG. 4: STM images of (a) 20 ML (1000\u00d71000 \u00c52 ), (b) 30\nML (2000\u00d72000 \u00c52 ) and (c) 40 ML (2000\u00d72000 \u00c52 ) Ag films.\nHeight profiles along the marked lines are shown (scales are in\n\u00c5). Small hexagonal islands on the top layer begins to grow\nfor & 30 ML films. These islands are more abundant on 40\nML films.\n\n(1)\n\nwhere kz is the component of the wave vector prependicular to the film surface, kz (E) is determined by the\nband structure, d0 is the interlayer spacing and n is\nan integer. \u03c61 (E) and \u03c62 (E) are the energy-dependent\nphase shifts of the electronic wave function upon reflection at the two boundaries of the film [16]. For the\nAg(111)/Si(111) case this would depend on the Ag band\nstructure (energy dispersion along [111] direction) and\nthe phase shifts at Ag/vacuum and Ag/Si interfaces.\nAlthough for a direct comparison, calculation for the\nAg/Si(111) system would be necessary, it is evident that\nquantum size effect (QSE) is important in leading to the\nobserved height preference of Ag islands.\nIt is interesting to note that the bilayer height on the\nwetting layer for the thinnest Ag film (1 ML) is about\n5.4 \u00c5 (Fig.1). (The same value of the double-layer height\n\n\f5\n\n(a)\n\n34\n\n(b)\nRelative Height [\u00c5]\n\nwas observed by Gavioli et al.[8] for film thicknesses between 1 and 2.2 ML. These authors did not study thicker\nfilms). However, for the thicker films (see figures 2, 3 and\n5) we observe some variation in the bilayer separation.\n[It should be noted that the actual value depends somewhat on the magnitude of the sample bias voltage and\nits sign. However, the trend remains the same]. While\nfor Ag islands on Si no report is available on thickness\nrelaxation depending on the total number of atomic layers in an island, for Pb islands on Si(111) surfaces an\noscillatory thickness relaxation was observed depending\non the number of atomic Pb layers in the islands. This\noscillatory thickness relaxation has been shown to be correlated with quantized electronic states in the Pb islands\n[12]. The thickness relaxation has been characterized in\nterms of the deviation from ideal thickness, defined as\n\u2206t = tN \u2212 N d0 , where N is the number of atomic layers\non the wetting layer, d0 is the ideal interlayer spacing and\ntN is the thickness of the island. For small N the deviations were found to be large [for example, \u2206t = \u22120.5\u00c5,\n0.2\u00c5 and \u22120.4 \u00c5 for N = 5, N = 6 and N = 7 respectively]. The amount of deviations also apparently\ndepend on whether the islands are isolated individual islands or islands of several tiers. (For Ag islands we show\nthe characteristic differences for these cases later). With\nincreasing thickness the island height variation tends to\ndiminish.\nFor as-deposited 60 ML films, growth of hexagonal islands is prominent as seen in the STM image of Fig.6.\nA height scan along the line in Fig.6(a) across multi-tier\nislands is shown in Fig.6(b). Single-layer height at the island edges are prefered. It is seen from Fig.6(b) that step\nheights for the inner layers are \u223c 2.6 \u00c5, while those of the\nouter layers are \u223c 3 \u00c5 \u2013 both much larger than the ideal\nAg(111) layer spacing (2.36 \u00c5). [ It should be noted that\nheight measurement by STM is affected by both structural and electronic contribution]. As we will show later\nfor annealed samples, where both individual and multitier islands are observed, multi-tier island edges prefer\nsingle-layer height (like that in Fig.6) whereas individual islands prefer double-layer or in general even-layer\nheight. This trend has also been observed for Pb islands on Si(111), where N values, which are practically\nabsent in isolated islands, are observed for multi-tier islands showing monolayer steps [12].\nIn the standard SK growth in RT deposition for film\nthicknesses above the wetting layer, formation of 3D multilayer Ag islands have been observed [6]. Here in RT\ndeposition for thin Ag films (1 ML) we have observed formation of 3D Ag islands with flat top and a strong preference for a double-layer height. Growth of 3D Ag islands\nwith a flat top and a preferred double-layer height was\nearlier observed only for 1\u22122.2 ML Ag films deposited at\nLT (150 K) followed by annealing at RT (300 K). For RT\ndeposition this feature of Ag island growth on Si with\na height preference has not been reported earlier. However, for Pb islands on Si(111), island height preference\nindicating quantum size effect was observed for growth at\n\n32\n\u2206N = 1\n\n30\n28\n26\n24\n\n0\n\n25 50 75 100\nDistance [nm]\n\nFIG. 6: (a) STM image (3000 \u00d7 3000\u00c52 ) of an as-deposited\n60 ML Ag film. Multi-tier islands, present but not prominent\non the 40 ML film, are very prominent here. (b) a height scan\nalong the line in (a). Monolayer (\u2206N = 1) steps are found to\nbe dominant for these multi-tier islands.\n\n170\u2212250K [12], 273K [17] and even at RT [13]. For higher\nfilm thicknesses (4 ML onwards), we observe the growth\nof a percolated Ag layer with a flat top feature on the\nislands with a height preference in units of double-layer\nheight.\nThe RT-deposited 40 ML film, when annealed at\n700\u25e6C, nanostructural hexagonal disc-like Ag islands are\nformed as seen in the STM micrograph of Fig.7(a).\n[Very few hexagonal islands appear in the as-deposited\nfilm (compare Fig.4(c))]. According to kinetic Monte\nCarlo simulation results, islands can grow on a substrate\nof threefold symmetry in various shapes depending on\ngrowth temprature \u2212 hexagonal shape being one of them\n[18]. We have also observed triangular island growth in a\nAg film on Si(111) annealed at 600\u25e6 C [14]. A height scan\nalong the line in Fig.7(a) is shown in Fig.7(c). We notice\nthat the hexagonal disc-like Ag islands have a preference\nfor a height difference, where \u2206N is even. This appears to\nbe the case when the islands are individual islands.

Prominent hexagonal disc-like islands are seen to have\nbeen formed. There are significant differences in the islands\nin (a) and (b). In (a) islands are apparently independent\nislands while in (b) smaller islands on progressively larger\nislands in a multi-tier form are seen. (c) Height scan along\nthe line in (a) shows strong preference for height differences\ncorresponding to an even number of Ag atomic layers. (d)\nHeight scan along the line in (b) shows monatomic height on\nthe island edges similar to what is seen in Fig.6 for multi-tier\nislands. Note the large difference in lateral dimensions in (a)\nand (b). Individual hexagonal islands are much larger.\n\never, when the islands are multi-tier islands, i.e. small\nislands growing on larger islands, the edges prefer to have\nmonolayer steps, as seen in Fig.7(b) and its corresponding height scan in Fig.7(d). Differences between individual and multi-tier islands have also been observed for\nPb islands on Si(111)\u2212(7 \u00d7 7) surfaces [12], although for\nmuch thinner films. For the Ag films of Si(111), up on\nannealing, growth of individual islands with \u2206N = 2 or 4\nbecomes more prominent compared to multi-tier islands\nwith \u2206N = 1. This indicates that \u2206N = 2 or 4 is energetically more favorable. For Pb islands on Si(111) as\nwell, up on annealing \u2206N = 1 tends to disappear in favor of \u2206N = 2 islands [12]. For Pb/Si(111) this has been\nattributed to quantum size effect. For Ag/Si(111) theoretical results would be necessary for a direct comparison.\nWithin our limited search over selected thicknesses (1,\n2, 4, 5, 10, 30, 40 and 60 ML) we have not observed\nuniform film growth. An extended search would be necessary to explore if there at all exists a thickness window\nover which film of uniform thickness can grow at RT or\nany other growth temperature.\n\nB.\n\nStrain\n\nHigh resolution x-ray diffraction (HRXRD) measurements were made with a rotating anode X-ray source (Mo\n\nFIG. 8: X-ray diffraction data obtained from 40 ML Ag films\nwith x-rays of \u03bb = 0.709 \u00c5 from a rotating anode source (circle: as-deposited film, square: 7000 C-annealed film).

Typical HRXRD results (\u03b8\u20132\u03b8 scan) from a 40 ML Ag film are shown in\nFig.8. Epitaxial growth of Ag(111) layer is seen from the\nAg(111) diffraction peak. No other Ag peaks were observed. The diffraction peak from the as-deposited film\nis broad, which can be attributed mainly to a mosaic\nspread. Mosaic spread in Ag(111) layers deposited on\nSi(111) at RT has been observed earlier [20, 21]. Mosaic\nspread decreases upon annealing. HRXRD results from\na Ag layer annealed at 700\u25e6 C (30 min.) shows a much\nnarrower Ag(111) peak indicating a reduction of mosaic\nspread and improvement of epitaxy upon annealing. The\nAg film, annealed at 700\u25e6 C, as mentioned before, form\nhexagonal disc-like islands (see Fig.7). Much thicker Ag\nislands are formed in this annealed sample. TEM measurements reveal this feature. Typical cross-sectional\nTEM micrographs and a transmission electron diffraction pattern are shown in Fig.9. The island in Fig.9(a)\nis \u223c 500\u00c5 thick \u2212 more than five times the deposited\nnominal thickness. The selected area diffraction pattern\ntaken from the region shown in Fig.9(a) shows diffraction from both Si and Ag indicating Ag(111) k Si(111)\nand Ag[110] k Si[110]. An isolated Ag island on Si of \u223c\n2000\u00c5 thickness is seen in Fig.9(c). In addition to the reduction in mosaic spread in the annealed film, growth of\nthick islands also may be partly responsible for narrowing\nof the Ag(111) peak in Fig.8.\nHRXRD experiments were also performed on a 700\u25e6Cannealed 40 ML film with monochromatized (\u03bb =\n1.033\u00c5) synchrotron radiation. The result (Fig.10) shows\ntwo distinct Ag(111) peaks alongwith the Si(111) diffraction peak. The results in Fig.10 were obtained with \u03b8steps of 0.002\u25e6 . However, we have also verified the authenticity of the Ag double peak structure by repeat-\n\n\f~\n~\n\n7\n\n800\nSi(111)\n\nCounts\n\n600\n\n400\n\nAg(111)\n\n00\n\n~\n~\n\n200\n\n9.30 9.45 9.60\n\n\u03b8\n\n12.60\n\n12.64\n\n12.68\n\n(degree)\n\nFIG. 10: HRXRD data from a 40 ML Ag film annealed at\n7000 C, obtained with synchrotron radiation (\u03bb = 1.033 \u00c5).\nTwo distinct Ag(111) peaks are observed with a small angular\nseparation \u2206\u03b8 = 0.050 . The d-spacing coresponding to the\nstronger Ag(111) peak is less than that of bulk Ag (see text\nfor explanation). The narrowness of the peak is consistent\nwith the formation of thick islands seen in Fig.9.\n\nFIG. 9: Cross-sectional TEM micrograph (a) and a transmission electron diffraction pattern (b) from a 40 ML Ag film\nannealed at 7000 C. Epitaxy of Ag(111) with Si(111) is seen\nfrom the diffraction pattern. (c) An island about 20 times\nas thick as the nominal deposited thickness is seen to have\nformed.\n\ning experiments with 0.001\u25e6 steps. The sharp peak and\nthe wide peak correspond to Ag(111) planner spacings\nof 2.355 \u00c5 and 2.364 \u00c5 (\u2206d = 0.09\u00c5), respectively\n(\u2206\u03b8 = 0.05\u25e6 between the peaks). The angular positions\nof the Ag peaks have also been verified with reference\nto the Si(111) peak position. The sharpness of the peak\nat larger \u03b8, i.e. for d=2.355 \u00c5 indicates that this component comes from a much thicker layer. As we have\nseen from Fig.9, much thicker islands, compared to the\ndeposited nominal thickness, are formed in the annealed\nsample. The broader weak peak apparently comes for\nthinner islands. The Ag peaks have been fitted using the\nTakagi-Taupin formalism based on dynamical theory of\nx-ray diffraction [19]. The theoretical curve for the narrow Ag(111) peak has interference fringes near the base,\nwhich are barely visible in this scale.\nWe now explore the possible origin of the sharp\nAg(111) peak corresponding to a shorter plannar spac-\n\ning. Lattice constants of Ag and Si are aAg =4.085\u00c5, and\nSi\naSi =5.431\u00c5 (dAg\n111 =2.359\u00c5 and d111 =3.136\u00c5). The lattice mismatch is \u223c25%. However Ag is found to grow\nepitaxially on Si [20, 21, 22]. This happens via coincidence site lattice matching as 4aAg \u22483aSi and the misSi\nmatch is just 0.43% (4dAg\n111 >3d111 ) [22, 23]. In this case\nan in-plane compression of the Ag layer would lead to\nAg\na perpendicular strain leading to dAg\n111 (film)>d111 (bulk).\nAg\nAg\nHowever, what we observed is d111 (film)<d111 (bluk) as\nAg\none component, the other being dAg\n111 (film)>d111 (bluk). A\npossible explanation for the shorter d-spacing (2.355 \u00c5)\nin Ag can be given in terms of coefficients of linear thermal expansion of Ag (18.9 \u00d7106 /K) and Si (2.6 \u00d7106 /K)\n[24]. As the expansion coefficient of Ag is about seven\ntimes that of Si, the Ag lattice being pinned at the Ag/Si\ninterface would expand faster in the surface-normal direction enhancing strain in the Ag layer. For the Ag/Si(111)\nsystem at 700\u25e6 C the strain in the Ag layer would be much\nlarger compared to that at RT. If we assume that this\nlarger strain would be relaxed by introducing dislocations at the interface and a fully relaxed Ag layer would\nform at 700\u25e6 C, the fully relaxed Ag layer would have\ndAg\n111 = 2.359\u00c5. As the thermal expansion coefficient of\nAg is much higher than that of Si, in cooling the sample\ndown to room temperature, the Ag layer would shrink at\na higher rate than Si. As the in-plane Ag lattice would be\npinned at the interface to that of Si, which shrinks at a\nslower rate, the Ag layer would have a larger shrinking in\nthe surface-normal direction leading to a Ag(111) planar\nspacing in the surface-normal direction smaller than that\nof bulk Ag. This is schematically illustrated in Fig.11. A\nthick Ag layer is likely to undergo this process. This is\n\n\f8\nalso consistent with the narrowness of the Ag(111) peak\ncorresponding to the shorter d-spacing (dAg\n111 = 2.355\u00c5).\nThe lattice contraction is 0.17% with respect to the bulk\nd111 spacing. The weak broader Ag(111) peak is likely to\nbe due to much thinner islands, which would be able to\naccommodate the strain due to thermal expansion mismatch without introducing dislocations. The presence of\na thinner island is also seen in Fig.9(c). There are actually thin islands with a thickness variation. The broader\npeak corresponds to a lattice expansion of 0.21% compared to the bulk d111 spacing. For \u03bb = 1.033\u00c5, the\nangular separation (\u2206\u03b8) between the two Ag(111) peaks,\nas seen from Fig.10, is 0.05\u25e6. For \u03bb = 0.709\u00c5 this separation would be \u2206\u03b8 = 0.03\u25e6 and with our laboratory set\nup it would be more difficult to observe these peaks as\nseparated peaks.\n\nRT\n\no\n\nheating\n\nAt 700 C\n\nRT\ncooling\n\nFIG. 11: The shortening of the perpendicular d-spacing in\nthe annealed film compared to the corresponding bulk value\nis schematically illustrated. See text for details.\n\nThere are reports that desorption of Ag from a Ag/Si\nsystem starts around 550\u25e6 C under UHV conditions [25].\nEarlier we studied growth of Ag(111) layers (\u223c 1000\u00c5) on\nSi(111) and their annealing behavior under high vacuum\n(HV) condition by RBS/channeling experiments [21]. We\nhave studied Ag/Si annealing (30 min) under high vacuum upto 800\u25e6 C. At 600\u25e6 C, we observed very little loss of\nAg. At 700\u25e6 C there were about 25% loss of Ag \u2212 mainly\nfrom grain boundaries without any detectable change of\nactual film thickness. At 800\u25e6 C (30 min) Ag films were\ncompletly desorbed [26]. In the present case we expect\nthat some desorption of Ag has taken place in the annealed film.\n\n[1] Z. H. Zhang, S. Hasegawa and S.

Venables, Surf.\n\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have studied growth of Ag on Si(111)-(7 \u00d7 7) surfaces at room temperature. Initial deposition of \u223c 1 ML\nAg produces islands with a strongly preferred height of\ntwo atomic layers of Ag on the wetting layer. Thicker\nfilms show a tendency of growth of N-layer islands, where\nN is even. This appears to be a consequence of electron\nconfinement in the metallic film. As-deposited thicker\nfilms (>20 ML) show the formation of hexagonal islands\nat the top. These multi-tier islands have monatomic\nstep edges. Annealed films show the formation of hexagonal disc-like islands. Individual islands show doublelayer height at the edges, while multi-tier islands show\nmonatomic height edges as in the as-deposited films.\nWhile the as-deposited films are epitaxial with a mosaic spread, the epitaxy improves up on annealing. An\nannealed 40 ML film has been found to show two closelyspaced Ag(111) peaks. The strong peak corresponding\nto shorter d-spacing compared to the bulk value can be\nexplained by the perependicular contraction up on cooling of the Ag lattice, which is presumably relaxed at high\ntemperature during annealing, as a consequence of thermal expansion mismatch between Ag and Si.\nWithin our limited search we have not observed, for\nRT growth, any thickness window for the uniform layer\ngrowth \u2212 a prediction from the electronic growth mechanism. Obviously an extended search over film thickness\nand growth temperature would be necessary to explore\nthis aspect.\nThe fact that bilayer growth is prefered even at the\nouter layers of relatively thick films needs further theoretical attention. Ag growth on Si(111)-(7\u00d77) at RT\ncannot be simply classified within the three commonly\nknown growth modes. The elctronic confinement apparently plays a role in determining the film morphology.
