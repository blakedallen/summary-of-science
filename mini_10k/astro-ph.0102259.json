Best known are the Arches cluster (Object 17,\nNagata et al. 1995) and the Quintuplet cluster (AFGL 2004, Nagata et al. 1990; Okuda\net al. 1990). However, it is likely that others exist, as these clusters lie behind thick layers\nof obscuring material (Portegies Zwart et al. 2001a). Most are expected to be invisible at\noptical wavelengths, but should be readily detectable in the infrared (Vrba et al. 2000) or\nin the 2MASS survey Dutra & Bica 2000).\nThe Arches and the Quintuplet clusters are the Galactic counterparts of R 136, the\ncentral star cluster in NGC 2070: the 30 Doradus region in the Large Magellanic Cloud\n(Massey & Hunter 1998). The structural parameters of these clusters-masses, radii,\nand density profiles- are quite similar, as are their ages. R 136, however, is located far\nfrom the perturbing influence of the Galaxy and the tidal effect of the LMC is negligible\n(Portegies Zwart et al. 1999). The Arches and the Quintuplet clusters, on the other hand,\n< 40 pc of the Galactic center, and their evolution is strongly\nlie at projected distances of \u223c\naffected by the Galactic tidal field.\nWe study the evolution of clusters like Arches and Quintuplet using a fully selfconsistent star-cluster model in which the dynamics of stars are followed by direct N-body\nintegration and the evolution of individual stars and binaries are followed using a stellar\nand binary evolution program. The importance of the tidal field of the Galaxy is studied\nby repeating each model calculations at several distances from the Galactic center. We\ncompare the results of our calculations with detailed observations of the Arches cluster and\nwith model calculations performed by others.\nWe find that, while all our models start with a mass function comparable to that in the\nsolar neighborhood, to an observer the current mass function may well appear to be much\nflatter. The unusually flat mass functions observed in both the Arches and the Quintuplet\nclusters may therefore in part be attributed to a combination of observational selection\neffect, the age of the cluster and the location at which the measurements were taken.\nThe star clusters studied in this paper experience core collapse within a few million\nyears. During this phase and at later time many stars experience collisions with other stars.\nThe clusters finally dissolve in the tidal field of the Galaxy. The disruption of the cluster\nis driven mostly by tidal stripping and two-body relaxation. Stellar evolution plays only a\nminor role in the disruption of the clusters.\nThe clusters expand as they age, causing their surface densities to decline. Clusters\nolder than about 5 Myr often have surface densities below that of their surroundings,\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nmaking these clusters virtually undetectable. Since the modeled clusters disrupt at ages\ngreater than 5 Myr, we estimate that there may be many clusters like the Arches and\nQuintuplet, but only the youngest are observable. This suggests that the formation of\nArches and Quintuplet-like clusters may be a continuous process. We cannot exclude,\nhowever, that these clusters were formed in a recent burst of star formation and that older\ncounterparts do not exist.\nThe numerical methods and selection of the initial conditions are discussed in Sec. 2.\nThe results are presented in Sec. 3 and discussed in Sec. 4. We summarize and conclude in\nSec. 5.\n\n2.\n\nThe model\n\nThe N-body portion of the simulations is carried out using the kira integrator\noperating within the \"Starlab\" software environment. Time integration of stellar orbits is\naccomplished using a fourth-order Hermite scheme (Makino & Aarseth 1992). Kira also\nincorporates block time steps (McMillan 1986ab; Makino 1991) special treatment of close\ntwo-body and multiple encounters of arbitrary complexity, and a robust treatment of stellar\nand binary evolution and stellar collisions. The special-purpose GRAPE-4 (Makino et al.\n1997) system is used to accelerate the computation of gravitational forces between stars.\nThe treatment of stellar mass loss is described by Portegies Zwart et al. (1998). A concise\ndescription of the Starlab environment is given by Portegies Zwart et al. (2001b, paper IV);\nadditional information is available at http://manybody.org.\nEvolution of stars and binaries is handled using the prescription given by Portegies\nZwart & Verbunt (1996, Sec. 2.1). However, some changes are made to the treatment\nof main-sequence mass loss in massive stars (see Portegies Zwart et al. 1999, hereafter\npaper III), and we incorporate a more extended prescription for stellar collisions, as\ndescribed by Portegies Zwart, Hut & Verbunt (1997).\nThe system of units used internally in the N-body models is defined by\nM = G = \u22124E = 1, where E is the initial internal energy of the stellar system,\nM is the total mass in stars and G is the gravitational constant (Heggie & Mathieu 1986).\nThe time required for a star to cross the clusters' virial radius rvir is\ntvir =\n\n\u0012\n\nGM\nrvir 3\n\n\u0013\u22121/2\n\n.\n\n(1)\n\nFor the runs considered here, the N-body and physical length scales are connected by\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nthe requirement that initially the star cluster is in virial equilibrium and exactly fills its\nzero-velocity surface in the Galactic tidal field (see Sec. 2.2 below). Once the cluster mass\nand distance to the Galactic center are known, the clusters' size scale is determined. The\n\u221a\nhalf mass crossing time (thm = 2 2tvir ) can then be expressed in convenient physical units\nas\n!1/2\n!3/2\nrhm\n[M\u2299 ]\n[Myr].\n(2)\nthm \u2243 42.2\nM\n[pc]\n< 25%) smaller than r .\nFor most density profiles the half-mass radius rhm is slightly ( \u223c\nvir\n\nThe half-mass relaxation time is calculated as (Spitzer 1987):\nthrx =\n\nrhm 3\nGM\n\n!1/2\n\nN\n.\n8 log \u039b\n\n(3)\n\nHere \u039b \u2261 \u03b3N is the coulomb logarithm; \u03b3 \u223c 0.4 is a scaling factor introduced to model the\neffects of the cut-off in the long range Coulomb logarithm (see Giersz & Heggie 1996; 1994).\nWe will also use the relaxation time at the tidal radius ttrx , for which we use Eq. 3 but with\nthe tidal radius rtide substituted for rhm .\n\n2.1.\n\nSelection of initial conditions\n\nThe two clusters on which we concentrate here, the Arches and the Quintuplet, lie in\nprojection within \u223c 40 pc of the Galactic center. Table 1 lists some observed parameters of\nthese clusters, along with some other clusters (and cluster candidates) having comparable\n< 1 pc, and are only a\ncharacteristics. All have masses of \u223c 104 M\u2299 , are very compact, rhm \u223c\nfew million years old. However, of the systems listed, only the Arches and Quintuplet are\nsignificantly perturbed by external tidal fields.\n\n2.2.\n\nThe tidal field near the Galactic center\n\nA star cluster embedded in the Galactic tidal field is not spherically symmetric. Rather,\nit is flattened and the stellar velocity distribution is anisotropic, particularly in the outer\nregions. The initial models which best describe such a cluster are the anisotropic density\nprofiles described by Heggie & Ramamani (1995). As in the usual spherically symmetric\nKing (1966) models, the density profile is described by the dimensionless parameter W0 .\nHigher values of W0 indicate a more centrally concentrated cluster (see the illustration in\nFig. 1).\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n\nTable 1: Observed parameters for some young, dense clusters.

By varying the density profile and the distance to the Galactic center\nwe study how the cluster evolution depends on the initial conditions.\nOur calculations start with 12k (12288) stars at zero age. We assign stellar masses\nm in the range 0.1 M\u2299 < m < 100 M\u2299 from the mass function suggested for the Solar\nneighborhood by Scalo (1986). The median mass of this mass function is about 0.3 M\u2299 ; the\nmean mass is hmi \u2243 0.6 M\u2299 . For models with 12k stars this results in a total cluster mass\nof \u223c 7500 M\u2299 . We adopt a mass function which is applicable to the Solar neighborhood\nrather than the flatter mass spectrum suggested by observations (Figer et al., 1999a) in\norder to determine whether the flat mass spectrum can be attributed to cluster dynamical\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nevolution. Initially all stars are single, although binaries do form via three-body encounters,\nin which one star carries away the excess energy and angular momentum necessary for two\nother stars to become bound.\nWe adopt three standard distances from the Galactic center: 34 pc, 90 pc and 150 pc.\nThe shape of the zero-velocity surface in the tidal field of the Galaxy only depends on\n\u03b13 /\u03b11 , which is independent of rGC . However, this does not mean that the models can be\nscaled with respect to distance from the Galactic center using the relaxation time alone.\nThe time scale on which the stars in the cluster evolve depends on the size of the cluster\nvia Eq. 2; when the cluster is located further from the Galactic center the crossing time\nincreases and the stars evolve relatively more quickly compared to the dynamical evolution\nof the cluster. This results in a more active mass loss by stellar evolution for clusters which\nare farther from the Galactic center.\nInitial density profiles and velocity dispersions are taken from Heggie & Ramamani\n(1995) with W0 = 1, W0 = 4 and W0 = 7, for a total of 9 models. At birth the clusters\nare in virial equilibrium and exactly fill their critical zero-velocity surfaces (\"Roche lobes\")\nin the Galactic tidal field. Tab. 3 presents a summary of the adopted initial models.\nFigure 1 indicates the shape and structure of models with W0 =1, 4 and 7 at rGC = 150 pc;\nmodels closer to the Galactic center are identical in shape, but the scale is different. The\nzero-velocity surfaces of the various models are represented as ellipses.\nWe test the reproducibility of our calculations by performing several calculations per\nset of selected initial conditions. Each calculation was performed twice with a different\nrandom seed. In addition, we performed a set of calculations without stellar evolution\nfor models with W0 = 1, 4 and 7. These same initial realizations were rerun with stellar\nevolution switched on, for rGC = 34 pc, 90 pc and 150 pc. In total, 30 simulations were\nperformed.\nStars are removed from the N-body system when their distance from the center of\nthe cluster exceeds 3rL1 . In N-body calculations it is not always trivial to determine the\nmoment the cluster dissolves, as a few stars may remain bound for an extended period of\ntime (Portegies Zwart et al 1998). In our models we identify the cluster's disruption as the\nmoment when no stars lie within the zero velocity surface. Typically, a few hundred stars\nremain in the N-body system (within 3rL1 ) at this time.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n\nTable 3: Overview of initial conditions for the simulations performed. Each row lists the\nmodel name, the distance to the Galactic center, the initial King parameter W0 , the initial\ntidal relaxation time, the initial half-mass relaxation time (see Eq. 3 and see paper IV for\nthe version in more usual astronomical units), the half-mass crossing time (see Eq. 2), and\nthe initial core radius, virial radius, and the tidal radius. The final four columns give the\nnumber of stellar collisions observed in each calculation, the time of core collapse, the time\nat which the cluster mass dropped below 5% of the initial mass (about 375 M\u2299 ) and the\ncollision rate in number of collisions per million years.\nModel\n\nrGC W0\n[pc]\nR34W1\n34 1\nR34W4\n34 4\nR34W7\n34 7\nR90W1\n90 1\nR90W4\n90 4\nR90W7\n90 7\nR150W1 150 1\nR150W4 150 4\nR150W7 150 7\n\nW0 = 1\n\nttrx\nthrx thm\n- [Myr] - [Kyr]\n53\n5.5\n43\n53\n3.2\n27\n53\n0.36\n9\n134\n14.6 105\n134\n8.1\n68\n134\n1.0\n25\n218\n23.6 169\n218\n13 110\n218\n4.5\n40\n\nW0 = 4\n\nrcore\nrvir\nrtide ncoll\n--- [pc] ---\n0.12\n0.20 0.76\n5\n0.05\n0.14 0.76\n8\n0.018 0.077 0.80 24\n0.19\n0.36\n1.4\n7\n0.09\n0.26\n1.4 15\n0.032 0.14\n1.4 14\n0.30\n0.50\n1.9\n5\n0.14\n0.36\n1.9\n8\n0.044 0.19\n2.0 14\n\ntcc\ntend ncoll /tend\n- [Myr] - [Myr\u22121 ]\n1.9\n7.4\n0.68\n1.2\n12.7\n0.63\n0.4\n12.0\n2.00\n1.9\n25.6\n0.27\n1.2\n32.6\n4.02\n1.4\n32.4\n32.4\n2.0\n45.8\n1.94\n2.0\n53.4\n4.08\n0.4\n55.0\n12.2\n\nW0 = 7\n\n1 pc\n\nFig. 1.- Illustration of the structure of star clusters with W0 =1 (left), W0 =4 (middle) and\nW0 =7 (right).

Later (in Secs. 3.5 and 3.6) we will\nconcentrate on a few representative models and compare these with the observed clusters.\n\n3.1.\n\nThe evolution of the cluster\n\nFigure 2(a) shows the mass evolution of the models listed in Table 3. Not surprisingly,\nclusters located at larger distances from the Galactic center tend to live longer than those\ncloser to the Galactic center.\nFigure 2(b) gives the evolution of the number of stars in several of our models with\nW0 = 4 at various distances from the Galactic center and compares the results with a\nmodel in which stellar evolution was not taken into account and in which stars were not\nallowed to collide. All the calculations presented in this figure were started with identical\ninitial conditions. The only difference between the various runs is the distance from the\nGalactic center (varying from 34 to 150 pc) and whether stellar evolution is included in the\ncalculation. In this figure, time is scaled with respect to each model's initial relaxation\ntime, i.e.:\ntrlx \u221d N/8 log(0.4N).\n(13)\nThe various lines in Figure 2 do not overlap perfectly, mainly due to stochastic\ndifferences in the moments when binaries formed and interacted. The small deviations\nfrom the model in which stellar evolution was not taken into account indicate that stellar\nevolution in these models in unimportant. If stellar evolution were important, clusters at\ngreater distances from the Galactic center should dissolve more rapidly. However, we see\nthe opposite trend: clusters farther from the Galactic center tend to dissolve slightly more\nslowly; the model without stellar evolution dissolves fastest. We have no ready explanation\nfor this trend. Note that for the models with stellar evolution this trend may be attributed\nin part to collisions, as they tend to heat the cluster; so clusters with higher collision\nrates (closer to the Galactic center) would dissolve more quickly in terms of their initial\nrelaxation time. Collisional heating also causes the cluster to become less compact, again\nreducing the cluster lifetime.\nAlternatively the trend of longer lifetime at greater Galactocentric distance may also\nbe explainable in terms of the interplay between stellar evolution, binary formation and\nstellar collisions. These possibilities require more detailed study, which is beyond the scope\nof this paper; however, work is in progress to address this point. We emphasize that,\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nalthough the trend looks like a subtlety, it may play an important role in the dynamical\nevolution of compact star clusters.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 2.- (a) Evolution of total cluster mass for models with W0 =1 (solid lines), W0 =4\n(dashed lines) and W0 =7 (dots) at distances of 34 pc (left lines) and 150 pc (right) from\nthe Galactic center. (b) The evolution of the number of stars (renormalized to the initial\ntotal of 12k) for the models with W0 =4 as a function of time in units of the initial halfmass relaxation time (see Eq. 13) for rGC = 34 (solid), rGC = 90 (dashes) and rGC = 150\n(dots). The dash-dotted line gives the evolution of the number of stars for the model without\nstellar evolution. These models were all calculated using the same realization of the initial\nconditions.\nFigure 3 shows the time variation of the relaxation time for the models at 34 pc and\n90 pc from the Galactic center. Note that the relaxation time measured some time after\nzero age bears little information about the clusters' initial conditions. The behavior of the\nhalf-mass relaxation time is qualitatively similar to that found in less compact clusters at\ngreater distances (6\u201312 kpc) from the Galactic center (Portegies Zwart et al. 2001b)-it\nfirst rises by a factor of a few as the cluster expands, then slowly decreases as the cluster\nloses mass.\nFigure 4(a) shows the evolution of the mean densities within the half mass radius in\nmodels R150W1, R90W4 and R34W7. The initial half mass densities for these models were\nvery different, ranging about three orders of magnitude. At later times the differences in\nthe half mass densities become much smaller; after five million years the difference has\ndecreased by about a factor of 5.\nAs in Fig. 2, Figure 4(b) also shows the densities of the models as functions of time\nscaled to the initial relaxation time (see Portegies Zwart et al 2001a and Baumgardt 2001).\nThe trend visible in Fig. 2 is somewhat obscured due to random fluctuations in the density.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Evolution of the half-mass relaxation time for clusters lying 34 pc and 150 pc from\nthe Galactic center, and with W0 =1 (solids) and W0 =7 (dotted lines; the W0 =7 models live\nlinger than the W0 =1 models).

Core collapse occurs within \u223c 1.2 Myr followed by a\ngradual overall expansion of the cluster. Similar behavior is evident in the isolated clusters\nconsidered by Portegies Zwart et al. (1999). The post-collapse expansion stops after a few\nmillion years, by which time the relaxation time has reached its maximum value (see Fig. 3).\nSubsequently, the Lagrangian radii decrease as the Jacobi radius shrinks and the cluster\ndissolves.\n\nFig. 5.- Evolution of the core radius (lower solid) and the 25%, 50% and 75% Lagrangian\nradii (dots, dashes and upper dotted lines, respectively) for model R90W4. The top line\nshows the instantaneous Jacobi radius of the cluster.\n\n3.2.\n\nEvolution of the binding energy\n\nFigure 6 shows the evolution of the binding energy (\u2212Etot , in scaled N-body units)\nfor models R90W4 and R90W7, which are selected for their similar lifetimes. (Some\ndeviations between the solid and the dotted lines are a result of our definition of a binary.\nHere we consider a binary to be a pair of bound stars for which the internal forces are a\nhundred times higher than those due to the nearest neighbor.) Initially, each cluster has\nEtot = \u22120.25 (see Sec. 2), but due to escapers, binary activity, stellar mass loss, mergers,\nsupernovae, etc., the total energy changes. A cluster ceases to exist when its binding energy\nbecomes positive. The two clusters exhibit quite similar global evolution. Model R90W4\nshows an initial \"plateau\" of a few Myr during which mass segregation occurs, driving the\ncluster into the core collapse phase (see Fig. 5). For model R90W7 this phase is hardly\nnoticeable as the cluster experiences several strong encounters and a few collisions early in\nits evolution.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nDuring the first deep core collapse the binding energy fluctuates rapidly because\nbinaries frequently harden and single stars are ejected following three-body encounters. The\nfirst collisions happen during this phase (see \u2022 in Fig. 6) and in both models mass transfer\noccurs in a dynamically formed binary, giving rise to an excursion in the binding energy\n(see the dotted line in Fig. 6). Core collapse is followed by the ejection of a hard binary\n(arrows in Fig. 6).\nAfter the first collapse of the core the binding energies of both clusters decrease steadily\nwith some strong fluctuations caused by close two- and three-body encounters (triangles in\nFig. 6), high-velocity escapers (arrows), stellar collisions (\u2022), mass transfer in close binaries\nand supernovae (\u22c6).\nModel R90W7 experiences much more binary activity than model R90W4. This can\nbe seen from the many departures of the dotted line in Fig. 6 from the solid curve. Such\nexcursions are the result of binary activity, such as mass transfer. A stable phase of mass\ntransfer generally results in an increase in the binding energy of the binary. Such binaries\nfirst become very hard as the orbital period decreases, then soften when the mass of the\ndonor drops below that of the accreting star. One example of this is clearly visible in panel\n(b) of Fig. 6, around t = 11 Myr. The phase of mass transfer stops after about 3 Myr,\nindicating that it is a case A (Kippenhahn & Weigert 1967), i.e. stable on a nuclear time\nscale (see also Portegies Zwart et al. 2001b). This episode stops when the donor leaves the\nmain sequence, becomes an envelope-depleted helium burning star and finally explodes in\na supernova (filled star). The mass loss in the supernova, forming a black hole, causes the\nbinary to be ejected from the cluster (up pointed arrow).\nThe spikes to lower binding energy in both models R90W4 and R90W7 are the result\nof stars which receive a high velocity following a strong encounter. Such a high-energy\nencounter may decrease the binding energy of the entire cluster for as long as the star\nis considered a cluster member (within 3rL1 from the cluster center). Model R90W7\nproduces many more high-velocity escapers than model R90W4, consistent with the greater\ndynamical activity within the more compact cluster.\n\n3.3.\n\nEvolution of the total luminosity\n\nThe total luminosities of the model clusters decrease with time as the clusters dissolve\nin the Galactic tidal field and the most massive stars evolve off the main sequence and\nbecome dark remnants.\nFigure 7 presents the integrated visual luminosity for the models R90W4 (see also\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 6.- Evolution of the binding energy for models R90W4 (a) and R90W7 (b). Solid\nlines include the binding energies of all stars (only the center of mass energy of binaries\nand higher order systems are included) the dotted lines include the binding energies of the\nbinaries. Initially Etot = \u22120.25 (see Sec. 2). The two lines with symbols in the horizontal\nbar above the figure indicate important happenings in the cluster lifetime. Triangles indicate\nthe moment at which a binary or triple is formed by a three- (or more) body interaction, the\nfilled and open asterisks indicate the formation of a black hole and neutron star, respectively.\nThe filled circles indicate the moment a collision occurs and arrows pointing upward indicate\nthe moment then a hard binary is ejected from the cluster. All these events are reflected in\nthe evolution of the binding energy.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nFig. 6a) and R150W4 (both models had identical initial stellar masses [in M\u2299 ], positions\nand velocities [in scaled N-body units]). Initially the luminosity greatly exceeds 106 L\u2299 ,\nthen drops steadily by more than two orders of magnitude as the cluster ages. After about\n4 Myr the luminosity suddenly drops due to the explosion of the most massive stars (for\nmodel R150W4) or because a few massive stars escape from the cluster as the binary in\nwhich they reside is ejected (for model R90W4, see also Fig. 6).\nOccasionally the luminosity again exceeds 106 M\u2299 as a runaway collision product leaves\nthe main sequence and becomes a Luminous Blue Variable or a Wolf-Rayet star. (Paper III\ndiscusses the collision rate in models with comparable initial conditions. A summary is\ngiven in Sec. 4.1.) In model R90W4 (Fig. 7a) this happens around 9.5 Myr and 23\u201325 Myr\nand for model R150W4 (Fig. 7b) near \u223c 6 Myr and 16\u201322 Myr. In these episodes the total\nluminosity of the entire star cluster is dominated by a single star. This episode suddenly\nstops when the star explodes or escapes from the cluster. The regular rises and sudden\ndrops in luminosity (for example near t = 33 Myr and t = 47 Myr in Fig. 7b) are caused by\nsingle stars which ascend the giant branch and then explode in supernovae (open and filled\nstars) or form a white dwarf (circles). The essential point, however, is that the cluster is\nbrightest at early times. Later increases in brightness may be caused by the rejuvenation\nof stars in collisions, but in general the total luminosity decreases steadily until the cluster\ndissolves completely.\n\n3.4.\n\nFraction of massive stars in the cluster center\n\nFigure 8 shows the evolution of the fraction of stars having masses greater than 1 M\u2299 ,\nwithin the 5% Lagrangian radius and near the 50% and 75% Lagrangian radii of model\nR90W4. Mass segregation causes the central mass function to flatten rapidly, but it takes\nconsiderably longer before the outer region of the cluster is significantly affected. After \u223c 4\nmillion years, the mass function within the inner 5% Lagrangian radius contains about 4\ntimes as many stars with masses exceeding 1 M\u2299 (relative to the local number density)\nthan does the rest of the cluster. The mass function near the half-mass radius remains\ncomparable to that of the cluster as a whole (see also Vesperini & Heggie 1997). The\nouter 75% of the cluster becomes slightly depleted of high-mass stars. Within one initial\nhalf-mass relaxation time, the fraction of stars having m > 1 M\u2299 in this region falls by\nabout a factor of 3. At later times, the fraction of high-mass stars throughout the cluster\nincreases due to the preferential escape of low-mass stars; at disruption, the cluster is rich in\nhigh-mass stars, while low-mass stars are depleted. This is in agreement with the findings\nof Takahashi & Portegies Zwart (2000), who concluded that the observed flat mass function\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nFig. 7.- Evolution of the visual luminosity of all stars within 3rL1 for the model R90W4\n(a) and model R150W4 (b).

(1999b) studied the mass function of the Arches cluster in two projected\nannuli, the inner one spanning 2.5 to 4.5 arc seconds from the cluster center (0.098 to\n0.18 pc, assuming a distance of 8 kpc), and the outer one extending from from 4.5 to 7.5\narc seconds (0.18 to 0.29 pc). They found that the cluster mass function is much flatter\nthan the Salpeter distribution (a power law with exponent x = \u22122.35), and that the mass\nfunction in the inner annulus is even flatter (x = +1 to \u22121.5) than that in the outer parts\n(x = \u22121.5 to \u22122.0). They estimate completeness down to 20 M\u2299 in the inner annulus, and\ndown to 10 M\u2299 in the outer one. The total number of stars in the inner annulus is 50 down\nto 20 M\u2299 , for a total mass of 2173 M\u2299 . The total number of stars in the outer annulus is\n122 down to 10 M\u2299 resulting in a total mass of 3164 M\u2299 .\nFigure 9 shows the observed mass function in the inner and outer annuli and compares\nthem with the mass functions of our models with W0 = 4 at 34 pc (dots), 90 pc (dashes)\nand 150 pc (solid line) from the Galactic center. The projected distance was kept constant\nat 34 pc. The comparison in Fig. 9 is performed at an age of 3 Myr. Each calculation was\nrepeated three times to improve statistics. We further compensate for the uncertainty in\ncluster ages and distances from the Galactic center by using annuli which are somewhat\nnarrower (from 0.098 pc to 0.139 pc and from 0.18 pc to 0.235 pc for the inner and outer\nannuli, respectively) than the observed annuli (from 0.098 pc to 0.18 pc for the inner annulus\nand from 0.18 pc to 0.29 pc for the outer annulus). We normalize to match a star cluster\nwith 105 stars5 .\nThe mass function for the cluster farther from the Galactic center is in better agreement\nwith the observations; the models at rGC = 34 pc do not reproduce the observations well.\nIn addition, the inner annulus is much better represented by both sets of models than is\nthe outer annulus, probably because the latter is much more sensitive to the dynamical\nevolution of the cluster and the adopted distance from the Galactic center. The top end\n> 50 M ) is underrepresented in both annuli. This discrepancy is\nof the mass function ( \u223c\n\u2299\ncaused in part by the steep slope at the upper end of our selected initial mass function\n(which has an exponent -2.8, where Sapleter is -2.35). We simply have not enough massive\n> 50 M , the initial mass function\nstars in our simulations. For stars more massive than \u223c\n\u2299\n5\n\nWhen comparing two stellar systems with a different number of stars a choice must be made about\nthe time at which the comparison is carried out. The time can be expressed in units of the initial crossing\ntime (or in million years as in Fig. 9), or in terms of the initial relaxation time of the cluster. For a purely\ndynamical comparison the initial relaxation time may be more natural (for a discussion see Portegies Zwart\net al. 1998).\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nin young star clusters may well be flatter than than adopted by Scalo (1986).\nThis method of comparing mass functions is very sensitive to the total mass of the\ncluster, its age, and the actual distance between the cluster and the Galactic center. These\nthree parameters are coupled via the relaxation time, and small changes in any of them\nmay have a profound effect on the derived mass function for the real cluster.\n\nb)\n\na)\n\nFig. 9.- Mass function for models R150W4 (solid) and R90W4 (dashes) and R34W4\n(dots) at an age of 3 Myear. The initial mass function of the whole cluster at birth is\ngiven by the dotted line (Scalo 1986). a) the mass functions at the projected inner annulus\n(2.5\u2032\u2032 < r < 4.5\u2032\u2032 ). b) the mass function in the outer annulus (2.5\u2032\u2032 < r < 4.5\u2032\u2032 ) from the\ncluster center. These annuli correspond to those in which Figer et al. (1999a) observed the\nmass function for this cluster (bullets). Arrows indicate lower limits due to incompleteness.\nIn order to compare our model calculations more directly with the observations we\nintroduce the ratio of the mean mass in the outer annulus to that in the inner annulus,\nwhich for the observations is fo/i \u2261 hmiout /hmiin \u2243 25.9M\u2299 /43.5M\u2299 = 0.597. By presenting\nthis value as a function of time (measured in units of the initial relaxation time of the\ncluster), we remove much of the observational bias.\nThis mean mass ratio fo/i is a characteristic of the cluster. For a Scalo (1986) mass\nfunction at zero age and in a system with a homogeneous density the value of this fraction\nis fo/i = 0.5016. As more massive stars sink to the cluster center due to mass segregation\nthe value of fo/i changes. The value of fo/i also changes due to the variation of the\ndensity profile in the cluster, and therefore is also a function of the distances from the\n6\n\nThe initial value of fo/i < 1 because of the different lower cutoffs in the nominator and the denominator.\nThe selected cutoffs are identical to those in the observations, which are more affected by crowding in the\ninner annulus.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\ncluster center at which fo/i is measured. The shapes of these curves, however, are rather\ninsensitive to the initial density profile because the evolution of the cluster mass (Fig. 2b)\nand density (Fig. 4b) do not depend sensitively on the adopted density profile. Because of\nthe uncertainties in the masses and hence the length scales of our models, we compute fo/i\nat various distances from the centers of our model (W0 = 4) clusters as functions of time.\nWe selected a total of 6 sets of inner and outer annuli, starting close to the cluster center\nand moving progressively outward. For the innermost annulus we selected rin = 0.003125,\nrmid = 0.05625 and rout = 0.09375 (in units of the initial virial radius) and we increased the\nradii by factors of two for subsequent annuli out to rin = 1.0, rmid = 1.8 and rout = 3.0. For\neach of our N-body calculations we computed fo/i for all combinations of 6 inner and outer\nannuli. To improve statistics we then combined the values for the inner two (solid line in\nFig. 10), the middle two (dashes) and the outer two (dotted line) annuli.\nFigure 10 plots these values of fo/i as a functions of time for our model calculations\nwith W0 = 4 and compares them with the observed mass function. We combined all models\nwith W0 = 4 to improve the statistics at the top end of the mass function. We computed a\ntotal of 14 models with these parameters, of which 8 were run for only 0.91 initial relaxation\ntimes and 6 continued until they dissolved (more than 3 thrx ). The various models were\nscaled to the initial relaxation time before being superimposed, as explained in Sec. 3. At\n> t\nlater times (t \u223c\nhrx ) some effect from stellar evolution may be influencing this scaling, but\nsince we are mostly concerned here with earlier times this does not affect our conclusions.\nThe vertical bar representing the observations may be shifted along the dotted line. The\n< t\n<\nbest fit for all annuli is obtained in the interval 0.05 \u223c\nhrx \u223c 0.2.\nThe value of fo/i for the inner annulus in Fig. 10 is much lower than for the outer\nannuli, but fo/i steadily increases to match the outer annuli near t \u2243 0.05 thrx . In the\nsame time interval fo/i for the outer annuli decreases somewhat. This effect is caused by\nmass segregation, as the most massive stars sink to the cluster center more rapidly than\nsomewhat less massive stars. On their way to the cluster center the most massive stars pass\nthrough the various annuli. The loss of a few massive stars has little effect on the value of\nfo/i in the outer part of the cluster as these annuli contains many more stars than the inner\nannuli. The arrival of a few massive stars in the cluster center, however, carries a relatively\nlarger contribution to the total mass in high mass stars to the inner annulus. The inner fo/i\nrises therefore more quickly than the value in the outer annuli decreases.\n> 0.2 t\nAt later time t \u223c\nhrx the value of fo/i rises sharply for the inner annulus while for\nthe outer annuli fo/i continues to decrease. The reason for this is the continuing effect of\nmass segregation; the more massive stars pile up in the cluster center while the clusters'\nouter parts become depleted of massive stars. After t \u2243 0.4 thrx, fo/i for the inner annuli\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n(solid line in Fig. 10) starts to decrease rapidly. The sharp peak in this curve is the result of\nthe two competing effects: mass segregation causing fo/i to increase, and stellar evolution\nresulting in its decline. This strong decline in fo/i is caused by the onset of stellar evolution\nas the model with the longest relaxation time (thrx = 13 Myr at rGC = 150 pc, see Tab. 3)\nstarts to run out of massive stars. The first decline starts at t \u2243 0.4 thrx , corresponding\nto an age of 5.2 Myr for the thrx = 13 Myr model. This time corresponds to the nuclear\nlifetime of a 34 M\u2299 star. The lower mass limit used for the outer annuli is 20 M\u2299 . Such\n> 0.70 t\na star has a nuclear burning lifetime of about 9.1 Myr i.e.: by the time t \u223c\nhrx all\nstars more massive than 20 M\u2299 have experienced a supernova and fo/i has consequently\ndiminished. (The slightly later time at which the outer annuli run out of stars is caused by\nthe inhomogeneous mixture of models used to make Fig. 10.)\n\nFig. 10.- The values for fo/i (the mass ratio of the mean mass in the outer annulus divided\nby the mean mass in the inner annulus) as a function of the time in units of the initial halfmass relaxation time. Each of the various lines combines the results for two of the measured\nvalues for fo/i . The solid line gives the sum of inner two values (with rmid = 0.06 and 0.11),\ndashed line for the intermediate range (rmid = 0.2 and 0.5) and the dotted line gives the\nvalue of fo/i for the outer annuli (rmid = 0.9 and 1.8). The horizontal dotted line gives the\nmeasured value of fo/i as measured by Figer et al. (1999a) with the Poissonian error bar (at\nright).\nThe observed value of fo/i (vertical bar) may be moved along the horizontal dotted\nline until it matches any of the curves representing the model calculations. A matching\nresult indicates that the observed mass function at these annuli agrees with a cluster at\nthe appropriate age in units of the initial relaxation time. We illustrate this with a few\nexamples.\n> 0.1 t\nAt later times (t \u223c\nhrx ) the observations fit quite well with the solid line in Fig. 10,\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nrepresenting the innermost annuli. Initially, high-mass stars are under sampled in the inner\npart of the cluster, and only at later times does mass segregation cause them to sink to\ncenter of the potential well of the system, explaining the initial rise in fo/i for the innermost\nannuli. If indeed the observed value of fo/i coincides with the model calculations at the\n> 0.1t\ninnermost part of the cluster, the observed cluster must be older than about t \u223c\nhrx .\nAt an observed age of the Arches cluster of 1\u20132 Myr the initial relaxation time must then\n< 20 Myr. Using the intermediate annulus of r\nhave been thrx \u223c\nmid = 0.18 pc to set the size\n> 1.6-3.0 pc. A\nscale of the models, the half-mass radius of the Arches cluster is then rhm \u223c\n> 1.6 pc and a relaxation time t\n<\ncluster with a half-mass radius of rhm \u223c\nhrx \u223c 20 Myr contains\nless than a hundred stars. Since the number of stars observed easily exceeds this number\nwe can firmly reject this solution: the observed radius of rmid = 0.18 pc then corresponds to\n<\n\u223c 2 rvir .\nAlternatively, we may observe the cluster when it is younger in terms of its relaxation\n< 0.05t\ntime. In the very early evolution of the cluster t \u223c\nhrx the observations are quite\n<\n<\nconsistent with 0.2 \u223c rmid \u223c 1.8 (the dashed as well as with the dotted line in Fig. 10), but\n< 0.11. The intermediate radius in the observations corresponds to\nis inconsistent with rmid \u223c\nr = 4.5\u2032\u2032 (or about 0.18 pc at a distance of 8 kpc). With these values the cluster would be\n< 0.05 t\ndescribed accurately by rvir = 0.1\u20130.9 pc at an age \u223c\nhrx . With an age of the Arches\ncluster of 1\u20132 Myr (see Tab. 1) the initial relaxation time of the cluster must be larger\n< 0.9 (corresponding to r\nthan 20\u201340 Myr. With a half-mass radius rvir \u223c\nhm \u2243 0.75 pc), the\ncluster then has a mass of about 4 000 M\u2299 in order to produce a half-mass relaxation time\n6\n< 40 Myr. If r\nof thrx \u223c\nvir = 0.1 pc, the total mass is 2.4 \u00d7 10 M\u2299 and the relaxation time is\n20 Myr.\nTaking the observed half mass radius of rhm \u223c 0.2 pc and correcting it for the effects\nof mass segregation and expansion during its early dynamical evolution to rhm \u223c 0.35 pc,\na relaxation time of 30 Myr implies a cluster of about 64k stars and a total mass of about\n40 000 M\u2299 . These numbers would also agree with the observed number of massive stars (50\nstars with m > 10 M\u2299 in the inner annulus) if a normal Scalo (1986) mass function were\nadopted. We thus see no reason to invoke a flatter than usual mass function to explain\nthe observations. This is consistent with the suggestion of Serabyn, Shupe & Figer (1998)\nthat the Arches contains \u223c 105 stars, far more than the 12k adopted in our models or as\nsuggested by Figer et al. (1999a), as we discuss in Sec. 4.\nThe limits on the initial parameters for the Arches cluster are summarized in Fig. 11.\nThe shaded ellipse shows the likely initial parameters for this star clusters.\nAssuming that the density profile of the cluster is consistent with a King model with\nW0 = 4\u20136 and adopting rhm = 0.35, we derive a Jacobi radius of 1.6 pc\u20132.5 pc. Consequently\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\n\nFig. 11.- Graphical representation of the constraints for our model of the Arches\ncluster. The horizontal and vertical axis give the half mass radius and initial cluster mass,\nrespectively. The diagonal lines are of constant relaxation time at the half mass radius\n(Eq. 3). The two error crosses locate the observed parameters for the Arches and Quintuplet\nstar clusters. The ellipse identifies the parameter space in which our model calculations are\nconsistent with the observed mass function, number of high mass stars and density structure\nof the observations for the Arches cluster (see discussion in Sec. 3.5).\nthe distance from the Arches cluster to the Galactic center is between 43 pc and 91 pc, for\nmodels with W0 =4 and W0 =6, respectively. We conclude that the Arches cluster is likely\nto be at a distance from the Galactic center somewhat, but not much, greater than its\nprojected distance. Table 4 reviews our conclusions about the Arches system.\n\n3.6.\n\nThe density profile\n\nFigure 12 shows the projected density profile of our model clusters with W0 =4 for\n> 20 M\nstars having masses m \u223c\n\u2299 at various instants. The data are presented in virial units\n2\n(horizontal axis in units of rvir , and the vertical axis in units of stars per rvir\n). The various\ncurves (and symbols) represent the density distribution of the model clusters at zero age\n(solid line), at t = 0.05 initial relaxation times (dashes), and at t = 0.5thrx (dotted line).\nMass segregation causes the density profile of the older clusters to steepen with time, tidal\nstripping causes the global density to decrease.\nThe open squares in Fig. 12 present the observed density distribution for the Arches\ncluster (Figer et al. 1999a). These data are given in arc seconds (or parsec when scaled to\nthe appropriate distance). We plot them on the same figure assuming that the observed\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\n\nFig. 12.- Projected density profile of the Arches cluster for stars with m > 20 M\u2299 from\nthe observations of Figer et al.

The arrow starting from the upper left most\nsquare indicates the direction in which to shift these symbols when the size scaling (in arc\nseconds) is increased by 1\u03c3.

The various other lines and symbols give the results of our N-body\ncalculations with W0 = 4. The various lines represent the density profile at the moment\nindicated (top right corner). These moments are presented in units of the initial relaxation\ntime of our models, ranging from zero age (solid line) to 0.5 thrx . The densities for our model\ncalculations were increased with a factor 64/12 to account for the larger number of stars\nexpected in these clusters.

This may be an overestimate, as discussed in the previous\nsection. There is some freedom in shifting the observed points along the arrow, which then\nchanges the scaling for the cluster.\nThe observed points fit best with the dashed line and are not consistent with the solid\n(zero age) or the dotted (t = 0.5thrx ) lines. The projected density profile of the observed\nArches cluster thus suggests an age of about t \u2243 0.05 thrx, in agreement with our findings in\nSec. 3.5.\n\n3.7.\n\nDistances to the Galactic center\n\nThe Arches cluster is located at a projected distance of \u223c 30 pc from the Galactic\ncenter, the Quintuplet at \u223c 35 pc. These measurements provide lower limits to the true\ndistances of these clusters from the center.\nThe mean density within the Jacobi radius of a tidally limited cluster is proportional\nto the local stellar density. (This is not a matter of definition-it happens to be true for\npoint-mass fields if one averages the point mass over rGC , and for the power-law density\nprofiles we consider here, since the tidal field \u223c M/R3 \u223c MG /rGC 3 \u223c rGC \u22122 dMG /drGC \u2243 \u03c1g ,\nbut it is not in general the case.) Thus, a cluster closer to the Galactic center is more\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\ncompact, has a shorter relaxation time, and therefore evolves more rapidly than a similar\ncluster at a greater distance.\nMost of our 34 pc models have densities higher than any of the observed clusters listed\nin Tab. 1 (see Fig. 4). Only the model with an extremely shallow initial density profile\n(R34W1) has density comparable to the observed systems. Clusters at greater distances\nfrom the Galactic center (but with the same projected distance) have lower densities. Since\nthe densities of the 34 pc models are too high by at least a factor of two, this suggests\n> 50 pc; a factor of 2 in density\nthat the real clusters are somewhat farther out, at rGC \u223c\ncorresponds to a factor of 21/3 in radius, so the true Galactocentric distance should exceed\n43 pc.\n\nFig. 13.- Evolution of the projected density within the half-mass radius for models R34W7\n(dots), R90W4 (dashes), and R150W1 (solid). The dotted horizontal lines gives the surface\ndensity at a projected distance of 34 pc, 90 pc and 150 pc (as indicated) from the Galactic\ncenter. The selected cases are quite extreme; R34W7 being the most concentrated model\nand R150W1 the least concentrated. The two error bars (to the left) indicate the location\nof the Arches (left) and the Quintuplet (right) clusters.\nFigure 13 plots the evolution of the mean surface density within the projected half-mass\nradius for models R34W7 (dots), R90W4 (dashes) and R150W1 (solid), which brackets\nthe central densities of the models. We view the clusters along the x-axis, so we look\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\nthrough the second and first Lagrangian points toward the Galactic center, giving the\nhighest possible cluster density and hence an overestimate of the true density contrast (see\nFig. 1). The two error bars give the projected half-mass densities for the Arches (left), and\nthe Quintuplet (right) clusters. The horizontal dotted lines give the background surface\ndensities a projected distances of 34 pc, 90 pc and 150 pc from the Galactic center.\nThe surface density at projected distance d from the Galactic center can be calculated\nby integrating the local stellar density \u03c1G (Eq. 10) along the line of sight to the cluster:\n\u03a3(d) = 4.06 \u00d7 10\n\n5\n\nZ \u0010\n\nd2 + z 2\n\n\u0011\u22120.9\n\ndz M\u2299 pc\u22122 .\n\n(14)\n\nIntegrating Eq. 14 from -100 to 100 pc (the range of validity of the Mezgers' equation) gives\nthe projected surface densities towards the Arches (at d = 30 pc) and Quintuplet cluster\n(at d = 35 pc). We integrate Eq. 14 numerically. Figures 14 and 15 illustrate this. An extra\n< 10%)\ncorrection for stars between 100 pc from the Galactic center and Earth adds little ( \u223c\nto the total (Bahcall & Soneira 1980). The projected densities of the observed clusters\nare comparable to the background. Clusters with lower background densities may well\nremain unnoticed among the background stars. Note, however, that the background stellar\npopulation is probably older than the star clusters studied here, and may therefore have a\nsmaller mass-to-light ratio, making the clusters stand out somewhat better. This may be\nthe reason that the Quintuplet was found even though its projected density is smaller than\nthat of the background.\nFigure 14 shows Eq. 14 and Eq. 10 both normalized to their value at rGC = 5 pc, which\nare \u03a3(rGC = 5pc) = 1.6 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 pc\u22122 and \u03c1G (rGC = 5pc) = 1.6 \u00d7 104 M\u2299 pc\u22123 .\nThe projected density of model R150W1 remains well below the background, and such\na cluster could easily remain unseen throughout its entire lifetime. The two initially more\nconcentrated models, R90W4 and R34W7, have projected densities above the background,\nat least initially. The cluster farther from the Galactic center has a lower initial density\nbecause it is more extended; after the first few million years, it may become hard to see.\nThe observation of the Quintuplet provides an upper limit on the critical contrast below\nwhich the cluster cannot be detected. We arbitrarily adopt a minimum contrast equals\nto the surface density of the Quintuplet cluster (i.e. \u223c 104 M\u2299 pc\u22122 ) as a threshold for\ndistinguishing a star cluster from the background. In that case, the 150 pc cluster would be\ninvisible for its entire lifetime, while the 34 pc and the 90 pc clusters remain visible for about\n< 25% of their respective lifetimes). Thus, although the\n\u223c 8 million years (\u223c 65% and \u223c\nclusters farther from the Galactic center live much longer, their visible lifetime is actually\nless than that of a cluster at smaller Galactocentric radius.\nAlthough not shown in Fig. 13, the surface density evolution of model R34W1 is also\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\n\nFig. 14.- Projected (solid line, Eq. 14) and three dimensional (dashed line, Eq. 10) density\nas a function of the distance to the Galactic center. Both densities are normalized to a\ndistance of rGC = 5 pc,\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\nconsistent with the densities of the observed clusters. On these grounds we therefore\ncannot exclude the possibility that the Arches and Quintuplet systems lie at Galactocentric\ndistances of 34 pc, but in that case they must have been born with very shallow density\nprofiles (which, however, would contradict our earlier analysis from Sec. 3.5, see Tab. 4).\n\nProjected Arches\nand Quintuplet\n\nGalactic center\nd\n\nQuintuplet\n\nz\n\ns\n\niu\n\nad\n\ncr\n\n0p\n\n10\nArches cluster\n\n50 pc\n\nObserver\n\nFig. 15.- Cartoon of the location of the Arches (left) and the Quintuplet (far left) clusters\nwith respect to the Galactic center. Earth is below. The large partial circle has a radius of\n100 pc. The ellipses representing the clusters are exaggerated by a factor of 10.\nThe surface mass density as presented in Fig. 13 may not be the ideal way to express\nthe visibility of these clusters; a luminosity density contrasted with the background would\nbe more appropriate. This, however, requires a detailed study of the observational selection\neffects, which goes beyond the scope of this paper. Another way to illustrate the visibility\nof clusters like Arches is by looking at the integrated visual luminosity of these clusters (see\nFig. 7).\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe Arches and the Quintuplet are among the youngest star clusters known in the\nGalaxy. They are not as rich as small globular clusters, but are considerably more compact.\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\nTheir central densities are comparable to those of the densest-post collapse-globulars,\nbut their life expectancies are only a few tens of millions of years. These clusters are\ndestroyed by tidal forces, accelerated by impulsive mass loss from supernovae (after \u223c 3\nMyr) and strong binary activity. In the following we first focus on comparison with other\ncalculations; we then discuss the consequences of our results for the inferred distances of\nthe Arches and Quintuplet clusters from the Galactic center, and for the number of such\nclusters which may be hidden near the Galactic center.\n\n4.1.\n\nComparison with other work\n\nPortegies Zwart et al. (1999, paper III) studied the evolution of R 136 in the LMC\nusing N-body simulations. Their initial conditions were comparable to those adopted here,\nalthough small differences exist. They adopted King models with W0 = 6, whereas we\nselected W0 = 4 and W0 = 7.\nThe calculations in paper III included the effects of stellar evolution and physical\ncollisions between stars, but neglected the effect of the Galactic tidal field and the possible\npresence of primordial binaries. Both may have a profound effect on a cluster's dynamical\nevolution. For R 136 the neglect of a tidal field may be appropriate, but for the Arches\nand Quintuplet clusters the tidal field is crucial. Our clusters therefore dissolve much more\nrapidly than the calculations in paper III. The latter models lost only a few percent of\ntheir mass within the first relaxation time, where our models lose up to \u223c 50% on this time\nscale, confirming the strong influence of the Galactic tidal field.\nPortegies Zwart et al. (1999) found that physical collisions between stars in their\nmodels were frequent, and that the evolution of the most massive stars and the dynamical\nevolution of the cluster were closely coupled. In all cases, a single star grew steadily in mass\n> 100M ) star in less than\nthrough mergers with other stars, forming a very massive ( \u223c\n\u2299\n3\u20134 Myr. The growth rate of this runaway merger was much larger than estimates based\non simple cross-section arguments, mainly because the star was typically found in the core\nand tended to form binaries with other massive stars there. We observe the same general\nbehavior in our calculations, in the sense that collisions tend to occur between high-mass\n> 10 M ) stars and that most collisions occur repeatedly with the same star. Although\n(m \u223c\n\u2299\nnot discussed in detail in this paper, we find the same trend in our calculations and\nconfirm the findings of Portegies Zwart et al. (1999). Kim, Morris & Lee (1999; KML99)\nperformed 2-D Fokker-Planck calculations of dense star clusters near the Galactic center\nand studied the lifetimes of the Arches and the Quintuplet clusters. Their calculations are\nsomewhat different than those presented in this paper in the sense that they only solve the\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\ntwo dimensional Fokker-Planck equation instead of the equation of motions for all stars\nin the stellar system. KML99 include standard binary heating (Lee et al. 1991) in their\ncalculations and neglect stellar collisions.\nWe selected the most representative cases of KML99 and recalculated these with our\nmodel. The Fokker Planck models dissolve much more rapidly (often more than a factor two\nin lifetime) than the N-body models (see Fig. 16). Similar discrepancies are observed in the\ncomparison between the Fokker-Planck calculations of Chernoff & Weinberg (1990) and the\nN-body calculations of Fukushige & Heggie (1995) and Portegies Zwart et al. (1998). The\ndiscrepancies are the result of the rather simple treatment of escapers in the Fokker-Planck\nmodels, which can drive the evaporation of the cluster on a shorter time scale then when\na self-consistent tidal field is used (see Takahashi & Portegies Zwart 1998 for details). An\nextra complication is introduced in the calculations of KML99 by selecting a maximum\nmass of 150 M\u2299 in the initial mass function. Such stars dominate the early evolution of the\nstar cluster while their behavior cannot accurately be represented with a statistical average\nas is done in a Fokker-Planck solver. Part of the spread in the Fokker-Planck results in\nFig. 16 may be attributed to these effects.\n\nFig. 16.- Cluster lifetime as a function of the initial relaxation time at the tidal radius for\nthe model calculations presented in table. 3 (\u2022, 9 models), those presented in Kim, Morris\n& Lee (\u00d7) and in Kim et al (2000; open squares). The solid line (tend = 0.25ttrx ) presents\nthe scaling of the models as proposed by Portegies Zwart et al. (2001a). The triangles are\n< 3000, which represents\ncalculated as an extra check on the behavior of the models when N \u223c\nthe parameter space covered by Kim et al. (2000; their models 101 111 112 and 141).\nKim et al. (2000) also perform N-body calculations of several of the models explored by\nKML99 using Aarseths' (1999) NBODY6. They also find that the N-body models live longer\nthan the Fokker-Planck models, but arrive at the same conclusion as KML99: the Arches\n\n\f\u2013 32 \u2013\nand Quintuplet star clusters must have unusually flat initial mass function and dissolve\nwithin about 10 Myr. The results of KML99 are completely understandable from their\nchoice of initial conditions. Many of their calculations start with a Power-law initial mass\nfunction with and exponent as flat as -1.5 (Salpeter = \u22122.35) and omitting all stars with\na mass smaller than 1 M\u2299 . Together with a small number of stars of only a few thousand,\ntheir models have an initial relaxation time at the tidal radius of only ttrx = 5 to 60 Myr.\nThe lifetime of these clusters is therefore expected to be only a few million years.\nFigure 16 compares the results of our calculations (\u2022 and triangles) with the FokkerPlank calculations of KML99 (\u00d7), the N-body calculations of Kim et al. (2000, squares).\nFor comparison we added the results of the analytic model presented by Portegies Zwart\net al. (2001a) as a solid line. The lowest values of our models (lower \u2022 for each ttrx ) are\ncomputed with W0 = 1, which dissolve somewhat quicker than the more concentrated\nmodels. The lifetime of the N-body models start to depend on N via the Coulomb logarithm\n(see Eq. 3) when the number of stars in the models drops below a few thousand. In this\nsmall N limit the scaling proposed by Portegies Zwart et al (2001a) probably breaks down.\nThis effect may cause our models with the shortest initial relaxation times to live longer\nthan expected (leftmost triangles in Fig. 16). A similar effect may cause the models of Kim\net al. (2000, open squares) to have somewhat shorter lifetimes than expected, as most of\ntheir models contain less than 3000 stars. Part of the discrepancy at small N and therefore\nat small relaxation times may also be caused by statistical fluctuations, which become most\nnoticeable at small N.\n\n4.2.\n\nHow many clusters are still hidden near the Galactic center\n\nAlthough the Arches and Quintuplet clusters are very dense, it may still be difficult\nto distinguish them near the Galactic center. The three-dimensional density contrast is\nseveral orders of magnitude, as can be seen in Fig. 4. In projection on the sky, however, the\ndensity contrast is reduced, due mainly to the accumulation of stars along the line of sight\n(see Fig. 13). The cluster density within the projected half-mass radius also decreases with\ntime, so these clusters are more easily seen at early ages than at later times. As outlined in\nSec. 3.7, to estimate the time over which our model clusters would be observable, we simply\ncompare the integrated stellar density \u03a3(d) along the line of sight to the cluster (Eq. 14)\nwith the projected stellar densities of the models.\nIn section 3.7 we introduced a limiting density contrast above which a cluster can be\ndiscriminated from the background stars, and used this to estimate the time during which\nour models would be detectable. At a Galactocentric distance of 34 pc, our most compact\n\n\f\u2013 33 \u2013\nmodels (R34W7) remain visible for \u223c 9 Myr; at 90 pc they become invisible after about\n7 ,Myr and at a distance of 150 pc from the Galactic center they remain invisible for their\nentire lifetime. Models at greater distances from the Galactic center, or those born with\nshallower density profiles, remain undetectable for their entire life times. It is therefore\nnot surprising that the clusters we observe near the Galactic center are extremely compact\nand very young. Less compact or older clusters are unobservable due to their low surface\ndensity contrasts.\nPortegies Zwart et al. (2001a) studied the time scale over which clusters such as\nArches and the Quintuplet systems remain visible. The results of their detailed N-body\ncalculations are used to calibrate a simple analytical model which is applicable over a\nwider range of cluster initial conditions. They conclude that clusters within 200 pc of the\nGalactic center dissolve within \u223c 70 Myr. However, their projected densities drop below\nthe background density in the direction of the Galactic center within \u223c 20 Myr, effectively\nmaking these clusters undetectable after that time. Clusters farther from the Galactic\ncenter but at the same projected distance are more strongly affected by this selection effect,\nand may go undetected for their entire lifetimes. Based on these findings, they conclude\nthat the region within 200 pc of the Galactic center could easily harbor some 50 clusters\nwith properties similar to those of the Arches or the Quintuplet systems. The results of our\nmore extended parameter study is consistent with their findings. Given the higher mass\nwe derive for the Arches cluster (see Tab. 4) compared to what was adopted by Portegies\nZwart et al (2001a) we argue that their results may even be somewhat conservative.\nAnother effect which may contribute to the difficulty in detecting clusters like the\nArches is the enormous range in luminosity of the brightest stars. CCD cameras have a\ndynamic range of less than 216 = 64k, causing the brightest stars to saturate the detector\nand preventing faint stars from being detected. However, these brightest stars are also the\nleast common; only with very deep exposures is the rest of the cluster revealed. Thus,\nwherever two or more bright blue stars are seen together, there may be an entire star cluster\nlurking in the background. An example of such a cluster may be the small group of stars\nidentified as R 1407 .\nFigure 7 presented the integrated luminosity for two representative models (R90W4\nand R150W4). In these models the total luminosity dropped by more than two orders\nof magnitude over the lifespan of the cluster. The individual high peaks are the results\n7\n\nR 140 contains at least two WN stars and one WC star (Moffat 1987) located at a projected distance of\n11.5 pc from R 136. One of the WN stars (R 140a) is a bright log L0.2\u22123.5keV = 1035.2 erg s\u22121 X-ray source,\npossibly a colliding wind binary (Portegies Zwart et al. 2001c).\n\n\f\u2013 34 \u2013\nof single stars which become extremely bright as a result of their rejuvenation in several\ncollisions. Such stars can temporarily outshine the rest of the star cluster. Of course, the\nluminosity and the lifetime of such a multiple collision product is quite sensitive to details\nin modeling the collision process.\n\n5.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have studied the evolution of young, dense star clusters near the Galactic center,\ntaking the Arches and Quintuplet clusters as specific examples. These clusters are generally\nreferred to as \"young,\" because they are only a few million years old, and indeed, even in a\ndynamical sense both clusters are quite young, having lifetimes considerably smaller than\ntheir initial relaxation times. However, by observing only the most massive stars in these\nclusters the dynamical image sketched by the observers is biased toward greater age, as the\nmassive stars evolve dynamically on shorter time scales than average cluster members. By\n> 10 M , one selects a part of the cluster that is dynamically\nobserving only stars with m \u223c\n\u2299\nrather mature, being comparable in age to the local initial relaxation time. This makes the\nArches cluster (and probably also the Quintuplet) appear dynamically older than it really\nis. We cannot test this hypothesis for the Quintuplet system because the available data are\nof lower quality than for the Arches.\nThe modeled clusters lose mass at a more-or-less constant rate, inversely proportional\nto the initial relaxation time, i.e. \u221d rhm \u22123/2 \u221d rGC \u22120.9 (see also Portegies Zwart et\nal. 2001a). Star clusters which are born farther from the Galactic center live therefore\nconsiderably longer than those closer in. The relaxation time derived from observation,\nhowever, contains little information about the initial relaxation time.\nMass segregation in our model clusters quickly causes the most massive stars to sink to\nthe cluster center. As a result core collapse occurs within about two million years, even for\nmodels as shallow as W0 =1. During core collapse close binaries are formed and collisions\nbetween stars are frequent. The collision rate is much higher than would be expected from\nsimple cross section arguments, due to mass segregation and binary formation. We confirm\nthe finding of Portegies Zwart et al. (1999) that the most massive stars are generally\ninvolved in a collision runaway, in which few low mass stars participate. This process\ncontinues until the runaway product is ejected by a supernova or a strong encounter with a\nbinary or the cluster dissolves in the tidal field of the Galaxy.\nBy comparing mass functions from our models at various distances from the cluster\ncenter with observations of the Arches mass function, we conclude that the age of the Arches\n\n\f\u2013 35 \u2013\ncluster must be about 0.05 thrx . With an age of about 1.5 Myr the initial relaxation time of\nthe cluster is then about 30 Myr. To reconcile the observed mass function with the observed\ndensity distribution of the Arches, we conclude that the cluster must be about 4 \u00d7 104 M\u2299\nand lie some 50 \u2013 90 pc from the Galactic center. With these parameters we can reproduce\nthe observed density distribution and the observed mass function for stars between 10 M\u2299\nand 50 M\u2299 without requiring an unusually flat initial mass function. The top end of the\nmass function contains more stars than our adopted mass function and this may require a\n< \u2212 2.8 (Salpeter = \u22122.35) initial mass function for stars > 50 M . However,\nflatter \u223c\n\u2299\n\u223c\nwe still conclude that the Arches cluster can be explained with a \"normal\" mass function.\nMost of the observed flattening of the mass function can be attributed to selection effects\ncaused by the limited range in distance from the cluster center in which the observations\nwere made.\nThe young clusters we discussed expand as they become older, causing their surface\ndensities and total luminosity to drop. Clusters which are older than about 5 Myr often\nhave surface densities below that of their surrounding, making these clusters virtually\nundetectable. By comparing the projected density of the model clusters with that of the\nfield stars in the direction of the Galactic center we conclude that the region within 200 pc\nof the Galactic center could easily harbor some 50 clusters with properties similar to those\nof the Arches or the Quintuplet systems. To find more clusters like Arches and Quintuplet\nsystems, we urge observers to look for single extremely bright stars. Closer study of the\nregion near such a star may well reveal the underlying star cluster.\nFinally, with our estimate of about 50 clusters with a mass of \u223c 40 000 M\u2299 each and\ndissolving within 100 Myr, we derive a star formation rate near the Galactic center of \u223c 0.02\nM\u2299 yr\u22121 . Clusters like the Arches and Quintuplet may therefore contribute significantly\nto the total star formation rate in the Galaxy.\nWe thank Rob Olling and Mark Morris for discussions, and the excellent comments\nof the anonymous referee.
