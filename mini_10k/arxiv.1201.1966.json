INTRODUCTION\nWith exponential growth of portable electronic devices like laptops, multimedia and cellular\ndevice, research efforts in the field of low power VLSI (very large-scale integration) systems\nhave increased many folds. With the rise in chip density, power consumption of VLSI systems is\nalso increasing and this further, adds to reliability and packaging problems. Packaging and\ncooling cost of VLSI systems also goes up with high power dissipation. Now a day's low power\nconsumption along with minimum delay and area requirements is one of important design\nconsideration for IC designers. There are three major source of power consumption in CMOS\nVLSI circuits: 1) switching power due to charging and discharging of capacitances, 2) short\ncircuit power due to current flow from power supply to ground with simultaneous functioning of\np-network and n-networks, 3) static power due to leakage currents.\nBinary addition is basic and most frequently used arithmetic operation in microprocessors, digital\nsignal processors (DSP) and application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) etc. Therefore, binary\nadders are crucial building blocks in VLSI circuits and efficient implementation of these adders\naffects the performance of entire system. In recent years various types of adder using different\nlogic styles have been proposed [1-12].

In [2] a 16 transistors full adder cell with XOR/XNOR, pass transistor logic (PTL) and\ntransmission gate is reported. Complementary pass-transistor logic (CPL) with 32 transistors\nhaving high power dissipation and better driving capability is reported in [4].Transmission gate\nCMOS adder (TGA) based on transmission gates using 20 transistors is reported in [5]. Main\ndisadvantage of TGA is that it requires double transistors count that of pass transistor logic for\nimplementations of same logic function. A transmission function full adder (TFA) based on\ntransmission function theory used 16 transistors [6]. Multiplexer based adder (MBA) having 12\ntransistors and elimination of direct path to power supply is reported in [7]. Static energy\nrecovery full (SERF) adder using 10 transistors with reduced power consumption at the cost of\nhigher delay is presented in [8]. Another design of full adder with 10 transistors using\nXOR/XNOR gates is also reported in [9]. A hybrid CMOS logic style adder with 22 transistors is\nreported [10]. In [11] a full adder circuit using 22 transistors based on hybrid pass logic (HPSC)\nis presented. Full adder for embedded applications using three inputs XOR is also reported in\n[12]. The function of full adder is based on following equation, given three single bit inputs as A,\nB, Cin and it generates two outputs of single bit Sum and Cout, where:\nSum= (A \u2295 B) \u2295 Cin\n\n(1)\n\nCout= A.B + Cin (A \u2295 B)\n\n(2)\n\nStructured approach for implementation of single bit full adder using XOR/XNOR has been\nreported [3] as shown in Figure1.

The XOR/XNOR gates can be implemented using AND, OR, and NOT gates\nwith high redundancy [1]. Optimized design of these gates enhances the performance of VLSI\nsystems as these gates are utilized as sub blocks in larger circuits. XNOR/XOR design with less\nnumber of transistors, lesser power dissipation and delay are highly desirable for efficient\nimplementation of the large VLSI system. XOR gate based on eight transistors and six transistors\nhave been used in many earlier designs [1, 13]. Four transistors PTL based XOR gates with\nlimited driving capabilities have been reported in [14]. Different designs for XOR and XNOR\ngates using four transistors have been presented in [9, 15-17].

Different power efficient\nadder designed with body biasing techniques has been reported in [22]. Further, CMOS adder\ndesigns with 9 and 10 transistors have been presented in [23].\nAt circuit level, an optimized design is desirable having less numbers of transistors, small power\nconsumption and adequate output voltage swing. Here, in present work a new XNOR gate with\nthree transistors has been proposed. A single bit full adder having eight transistors based on\nproposed XNOR module and one multiplexer block having two transistors has been presented.\nThe rest of paper is organized as follows: In Section II, a new three transistors XNOR gate has\nbeen reported and single bit full adder circuit based on XNOR gates and multiplexer has been\ndesigned. In section III results of proposed XNOR cell and single bit full adder designed in\nprevious section have been presented and compared with previous reported circuits. Section IV\nconcludes the work.\n\nII. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION\nProposed design of XNOR with three transistors has been shown in Figure 2. In XNOR circuit,\nthe gate lengths of all three transistors have been taken as 0.35\u03bcm. Width (Wn) of NMOS\ntransistors N1 and N2 has been taken 5.0\u03bcm and 1.0\u03bcm respectively. Width (Wp) for transistor P1\nhas been taken as 2.0\u03bcm. In proposed XNOR, when A=B=0 output is high because transistor P1\nis on and N1, N2 transistors are off. With input combinations of A=0 and B=1 circuit shows low\noutput as transistor P1 is off and output node is discharged by transistor N2, which is in on\ncondition. In case when A=B=1, output node shows high logic as transistor N1 is on and high\nlogic is passed to output. Width (Wn) of N1 is made large to provide low resistance and due to\nwhich signal B is passed to output with less delay, whereas P1 gives higher resistance and higher\ndelay to pass the Vdd signal. For N1 transistor width has been increased which provides reduction\nin threshold voltage as shown in equation (5) [24]. Due to this decrease in Vt the degradation in\nthe output logic is reduced and signal shows sufficient voltage swing.\n\nVt = Vt 0 + \u03b3\n\n(V\n\nSB\n\n)\n\n+ \u03c60 \u2212 \u03b1 l\n\nt ox\n(VSB + \u03c60 ) \u2212 \u03b1 v t ox Vds + \u03b1 w t ox (VSB + \u03c60 )\nL\nL\nW\n\n(5)\n\nWhere Vt0 is the zero bias threshold voltage, \u03b3 is bulk threshold coefficient, \u03c60 is 2 \u03c6 F and \u03c6 F is\nFermi potential, tox is the thickness of oxide and \u03b1l , \u03b1v and \u03b1w are the process dependent\nparameters. From (5) it is obvious that by increasing the W it is possible to reduce the voltage\ndegradation.\nFurther, due to higher delay provided by PMOS transistor (P1), drain source voltage (Vds) of N1\nis increased gradually. Transistor N1 operates in non-saturation region and then goes to saturation\nregion. On resistance of MOS transistor consists of the series combination of Rd (drain resistance)\nand Rs (source resistance) and channel resistance. As for superior switching action higher Vgs is\ndesirable. Transistor N1 has larger width, less resistance and higher Vgs so switching is very fast\nin this case. When Vds is less than Vgs-Vt but greater than zero the channel resistance in non\nsaturation region is given as by [25]\n\nRon =\n\nL\nKW (Vgs \u2212 Vt \u2212 Vds )\n\n(6)\n\nHere, Ron is reduced and signal B is rapidly passed to output which further increase the Vds of\ntransistor N1. In saturation region output resistance Ron varies with Vds [26]. As Vds is increased\nthe pinch off moves toward source region and there is incremental change in output impedance\n[26]. Output resistance is given as\n49\n\n\fInternational Journal of VLSI design & Communication Systems (VLSICS) Vol.2, No.4, December 2011\n\nRon =\n\n2L 1\n\u2206L I d\n1\u2212\nL\n\nqN b\n(Vds \u2212 Vds , sat )\n2 \u2208si\n\n(7)\n\nWhere L is the channel length, \u2206L is the small change in length due to increased Vds, Id is the\ndrain current, and Nb is doping concentration. With higher Vds, the output resistance increase in\nsaturation region. This condition is applicable for both N1 and N2 because of high Vds for these\ntransistors. Due to higher resistance provided by N1 and N2 in saturation region the high output\nlogic is maintained at output node.\nIn another case when A=1 and B=0 both transistors (P1 & N1) are on and output node is\ndischarged rapidly by N1 and N2 transistors. In this case with A=1 transistor N1 turns on which\nfurther turn on the transistor N2 and a conducting path is provided by N1 and N2. This\nconnectivity of output node with ground discharges the output node. The switching speed of N1\nis higher than N2 because delay is inversely proportional to channel width [1]. Due to on\ncondition of transistor N1 the gate voltage of N2 increase above its threshold voltage and\ntransistor N2 also goes in on condition. In this position the circuit is just behaving like an inverter\nwith A=1 as input and gives output as low logic. Transistor P1 is just acting as load resistance\nwith grounded gate input (B= 0).\nVdd\nB\n\nP1\n\nA\n\nN1\n\nXNOR\n\nN2\n\nFigure 2: Design of proposed 3 transistors XNOR gate\nXOR operation can be obtained with addition of additional inverter.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nTable 1 shows power consumption, delay and output voltage levels with varying supply voltage\n[3.3 -1.8] V for proposed XNOR gate [Figure 2]. Power consumption varies from [500.727 89.931] \u03bcW with variations in supply voltage from [3.3 - 1.8] V as shown in Figure 5. Delay\nvaries from [14.466 - 23.050] ps with variations in supply voltage from [3.3 - 1.8] V and has been\nshown in Figure 6. Power consumption has been reduced due to reduced transistor count and\nreduced capacitance in the XNOR circuit.

CONCLUSIONS\nIn current work, a new low power XNOR gate with three transistors have been reported which\nshows power dissipation of 500.7272 \u03bcW. Compared with earlier reported XNOR gates,\nproposed circuit shows less power consumption and better output signal levels with reduce\ntransistor count. A single bit full adder with 8 transistors based on proposed XNOR gate has been\npresented which show power consumption of 581.542\u03bcW with maximum output delay of\n15.1311 ps. Proposed full adder has been compared with earlier reported circuits and reported\ncircuit shows reduced power consumption with less number of transistors.\n57\n\n\fInternational Journal of VLSI design & Communication Systems (VLSICS) Vol.2, No.4, December 2011\n\nREFERENCES\n[1]\n\nY.
