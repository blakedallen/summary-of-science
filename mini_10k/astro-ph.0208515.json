This paper advocates the use of these effects in wide field surveys to map largescale structure and the profiles of galaxy and cluster sized halos. The magnitude of the size variation\nas a function of angular scale is computed and the signal-to-noise is estimated for different survey\nparameters. Forthcoming surveys, especially well designed space-based imaging surveys, will have high\nsignal-to-noise on scales of about 0.1 arcminute to several degrees. Thus the clustering of matter could\nbe measured on spatial scales of about 50 Kpc to 100 Mpc. The signal-to-noise is dominated by sample\nvariance rather than shot-noise due to the finite number density of galaxies, hence the accuracy of the\nmeasurements will be limited primarily by survey area, sampling strategy and possible systematics.\nMethods based on magnification are compared with the use of shape distortions and the contrasts and\ncomplementarities are discussed. Future work needed to plan survey strategy and interpret measurements\nbased on magnification is outlined.\nSubject headings: cosmology: theory - gravitational lensing - large-scale structure of universe\n(ii) The signal-to-noise (henceforth S/N ) due to shot\nnoise is somewhat lower for magnification effects than the\nshear, and this has proven critical in cluster lensing, since\na factor of 2 in S/N is hard to make up. However field\nlensing surveys with areas larger than 10 square degrees\nare mostly in the regime where sample variance or systematics dominate the errors. It is therefore feasible that\nfrom forthcoming imaging surveys with good control of\nsystematics (photometric calibration for number density,\nresolution for sizes, and psf anisotropy for shear) all three\nlensing measurements can be made. Consistency checks on\nthe different systematics can then be made, the S/N on\nthe measured dark matter clustering improved, and new\ninformation on halo properties can be extracted.\n(iv) Space based imaging surveys will make possible the\nmeasurements of sizes with an accuracy hard to achieve\nfrom the ground. Such surveys will become feasible over\nsmall areas with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the\nHST, and over substantial fractions of the sky with a wide\nfield imaging satellite telescope.\nThe main goal of this paper is to propose that measurements of magnification effects, in particular the effect\non galaxy sizes, be an integral part of the lensing agenda\nfor forthcoming imaging surveys: wide area, multi-color\nground based surveys like the CFHT Legacy Survey (see\nwww.cfht.hawaii.edu/Science/CFHLS/), the proposed\nLSST (www.lss.org) and WFHRI (www.ifa.hawaii.edu/\n \u0303kaiser/wfhri) surveys, and especially a space based\nimaging survey as proposed for the SNAP satellite\n(http://snap.lbl.gov) which will have the key requirements\nof small psf and pixels \u223c 0.1 arcsecond, photometric redshifts, and survey area exceeding 100 square degrees (G.\nBernstein, private communication). The formalism for\ncomputing statistical measures of magnification is presented in Section 2. Section 3 provides estimates of the\nS/N expected for measurements of size fluctuations. We\nconclude in Section 4.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nGravitational lensing refers to the distortions in images\nof distant galaxies due to the deflection of light rays by\nmass concentrations. The distortion on a circular image\ncan be decomposed into an amplification of the size of the\nimage and an anisotropic stretching of its shape into an\nellipse. The size amplification is called magnification and\nthe anisotropic stretching is the shear. Gravitational lensing due to galaxy clusters and large-scale structure typically leads to distortions of order 1-10% (e.g. Gunn 1967;\nMiralda-Escude 1991; Blandford et al 1991; Kaiser 1992;\nBernardeau, van Waerbeke & Mellier 1997; Jain & Seljak\n1997; Kaiser 1998). In this regime of weak lensing the\nmagnification \u03bc is given by\n\u03bc = (1 \u2212 \u03ba)2 \u2212 |\u03b3|2\n\n\u0001\u22121\n\n\u2243 1 + 2\u03ba.\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03ba is the convergence and \u03b3 the complex shear. So\nfar observational studies of weak lensing have largely used\nthe measured ellipticities to estimate the shear and thus\nthe projected mass distribution.\nThis paper makes the case for using effects of magnification in addition to the shear in mapping dark matter.\nMagnification leads to fluctuations in the sizes and number densities (in a flux limited survey) of galaxies (e.g.\nBartelmann & Narayan 1995; Broadhurst, Taylor & Peacock 1995; Schneider, King & Erben 200). In the context of\ngalaxy clusters the change in number density has been used\nto constrain the mass distribution, but with less accuracy\nthan the shape measurements (Taylor et al 1998). We argue that for forthcoming blank field surveys the prospects\nare much better than for clusters to measure both effects\nof magnification, on sizes and number densities.\n(i) Magnification effects, unlike the shear, require control fields to estimate the mean, unlensed size distribution.\nThis had been a limitation for small, arcminute sized, cluster fields, but is automatically done in a blank field survey.\n1\n\n\f2\n2. STATISTICAL MEASURES OF MAGNIFICATION\n\n2.1. Fluctuations in the size distribution\nThe lensing effect of an overdensity in the mass distribution is to increase the area of a given patch on the sky.\nThe size of a given galaxy therefore increases. The area A\nand characteristic radius R \u221d A1/2 of a galaxy, for \u03ba \u226a 1,\nis then given by:\nA \u2192 A(1 + 2\u03ba); R \u2192 R(1 + \u03ba).\n\n(2)\n\nThus the logarithm of the sizes is shifted linearly as\nlog R \u2192 log R + \u03ba.\nFollowing the notation of Jain & Seljak (1997)\nwe introduce\nthe unperturbed metric\nds2\n=\n\u0002\n\u0003\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\na (\u03c4 ) \u2212d\u03c4 + d\u03c7 + r (d\u03b8 + sin \u03b8d\u03c6 ) , with \u03c4 being\nconformal time, a the expansion factor normalized to\nunity today, \u03c7 the radial comoving distance and r(\u03c7) the\ncomoving angular diameter distance. The convergence \u03ba\nis a weighted projection of the mass density along the line\nof sight. It can be expressed as\nZ \u03c7H\n3\n\u03b4(r\u03c6\u0302, \u03c7)\n\u03bai (\u03c6\u0302) = \u03a9m\nd\u03c7 gi (\u03c7)\n,\n(3)\n2\na\n0\nwhere \u03c7H denotes the distance to the horizon. With W (\u03c7)\ndenoting the radial distribution of galaxies in the sample,\nthe radial weight function g(\u03c7) is given by\nZ \u03c7H\nr(\u03c7\u2032 \u2212 \u03c7)\nW (\u03c7\u2032 )d\u03c7\u2032 .\n(4)\ng(\u03c7) = r(\u03c7)\nr(\u03c7\u2032 )\n\u03c7\nThe variance in the size fluctuations can be related to\nthe variance in the smoothed convergence by considering the mean size R\u0304\u03b8 in a circular aperture of angle \u03b8.\nIf the unlensed or intrinsic mean size in such an aperture is denoted R\u0304\u03b8i , then we can define the size shift\n\u03b4R \u2261 (R\u0304\u03b8 \u2212 R\u0304\u03b8i )/R\u0304\u03b8i . Using equations 2 and 3 the variance of the shift in sizes along different lines of sight can\nbe obtained in terms of the power spectrum of density\nfluctuations as\nZ \u221e\nZ \u03c70\n2\n2\n2\na\u22122 (\u03c7)\nh\u03b4R i(\u03b8) = 36\u03c0 \u03a9m\nkdk\n0\n\n0\n\n\u00d7 P\u03b4 (k, \u03c7) g 2 (\u03c7)U 2 [kr(\u03c7)\u03b8]d\u03c7,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere U (x) = 2J1 (x)/x, with J1 (x) being the Bessel function of first order.\n2.2. Cross-correlations induced by magnification\nMagnification causes the observed area of a given patch\nof sky to increase, tending to dilute the number density, but galaxies fainter than the limiting magnitude are\nbrightened and may be included in the sample, thus increasing the number density. The net effect, known as\nmagnification bias, can go either way depending on the\nslope s of the number counts of galaxies N0 (m) in a sample with limiting magnitude m, s = d log N0 /dm. Magnification by amount \u03bc changes the number counts to\n(e.g. Broadhurst, Taylor & Peacock 1995), N \u2032 (m) =\nN0 (m)\u03bc2.5s\u22121 . In the weak lensing regime, this reduces to\nN \u2032 (m) = N0 (m) [1 + 5(s \u2212 0.4)\u03ba] . Variations in the number density which are correlated over some angular separation are produced due to the spatial correlations of the\n\nlensing dark matter. These correlations are difficult to detect since the galaxies have a strong auto-correlation function due to their spatial clustering. However the crosscorrelation of two galaxy samples with non-overlapping\nredshift distributions isolates the effect of magnification\nbias.\nThe cross-correlation of a foreground-background\ngalaxy sample can be obtained in the Limber approximation (Moessner & Jain 1998):\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u03c7H\n\nd\u03c7W1 (\u03c7)\n\u03c9\u00d7 (\u03b8) = 3\u03a9m (2.5s2 \u2212 1)4\u03c0\n0\nZ \u221e\n\u00d7\ndk k P\u00d7 (\u03c7, k) J0 [kr(\u03c7)\u03b8] ,\n\ng2 (\u03c7)\na\n(6)\n\n0\n\nwhere the subscripts 1, 2 denote the foreground and background populations respectively and P\u00d7 (\u03c7, k) is the projected galaxy-mass cross-power spectrum. \u03c9\u00d7 (\u03b8) can also\nbe measured by the quasar-galaxy correlations that have\nbeen extensively discussed in the literature. The sizes of\nbackground galaxies discussed in the previous sub-section\ncan be used as well; this would alter the equation above\nonly in the numerical coefficient on the right-hand side.\nNote that \u03c9\u00d7 (\u03b8) is a measure of the galaxy-mass crosscorrelation. It is the counterpart of galaxy-galaxy lensing, with the difference that the convergence is measured\nrather than the tangential shear. Hence it provides a more\nlocal measure of the galaxy-mass cross-correlation, which\nin the small scale regime probes the structure of galactic\nhalos. For galaxy clusters one can measure size increases or\nnumber counts of background galaxies around individually\nclusters from high quality data, else they can be stacked\nlike the galaxies. Large catalogs of clusters will soon be\navailable for such measurements, and conversely, mass selected cluster catalogs may be obtainable from these measures of the convergence.\n2.3. Corrections of high redshift supernovae magnitudes\nRecently Dalal et al (2002) have estimated the capability of shear maps to correct the lensing induced dispersion\nin the measured magnitudes of high redshift supernovae.\nThe idea is the following. Magnification effects contribute\nto the measured scatter in the magnitudes of high redshift\nsupernovae. Since the lensing contribution can equal or\n> 1, it\nexceed the intrinsic dispersion for supernovae at z \u223c\nis valuable to be able to measure the lensing effect along\nthe lines of sight to individual supernovae from another\ntracer and thus correct the supernovae magnitudes. Dalal\net al (2002) needed to assume that the convergence can\nbe reconstructed on arcminute scales from ellipticity data,\nwhich may not prove to be feasible as they discuss. Measurements of size fluctuations however could directly map\nthe convergence on arcminute scales around the line of\nsight to supernovae, allowing for a reduction in the scatter\nof supernova magnitudes.\nThe main open questions are: How large is the shot\nnoise effect for a given survey? How strongly is the\nsmoothed convergence estimated from source galaxies correlated with the value along the line of sight to individual\nsupernovae? On arcminute scales ray tracing simulations\ncan be used to estimate how much stronger this correlation\nis than assumed in the Gaussian limit taken by Dalal et al\n\n\f3\n(2002). Hence a quantitative study is merited to check if\none can do better than the reduction of about 10% in the\nlensing dispersion reported by these authors.\n3. SIGNAL-TO-NOISE ESTIMATES\n\nWe use as the primary observable the log of the linear\nsize (such as half-light radius). To measure a lensing signal, it is best to select galaxies on surface brightness which\nis conserved by lensing (Bartelmann & Narayan 1995). In\nthe following we will assume that photometric redshifts\nare measured for the galaxies and that the surface brightness is not contaminated by atmospheric or instrumental\neffects. The number density of usable galaxies will depend\non how conservative the catalog selection for a specific instrument and survey will need to be. The S/N in the\nvariance on smoothing scale \u03b8 using galaxy sizes as an estimator of the magnification is then given in terms of the\nstandard deviation \u03c3i in the intrinsic solid angles and the\nnumber of galaxies N\u03b8 per circle of size \u03b8. For a single\nfield of size \u03b8 the S/N is:\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u03c3 2 (\u03b8)\nS\n= 2 \u03ba\n,\n(7)\nN 1\u2212field \u03c3i (I)/N\u03b8\nwhere \u03c3\u03ba2 (\u03b8) = h\u03ba2 i is the variance in the convergence with\na top-hat smoothing of angular size \u03b8, and \u03c3i (I) is the\nstandard deviation of the size distribution in a given bin\nin physical surface brightness. This differs from the corresponding expression for ellipticity measurements because\nthe denominator contains a different \u03c3\u01eb2 /N\u03b8\u01eb (the signal due\nto the variance of \u03ba or \u03b3 in the numerator is equal in the\nweak lensing regime). From ground based data, the S/N\nfor the ellipticity is larger than for the size since psf smearing directly affects the size estimate and affects the shape\nonly at second order. From space based data however it\nis hard to say a priori whether the S/N from shape measures is higher (at least by larger than a factor of two) for\na given survey area. In any case, as shown below, on large\nscales sample variance dominates the statistical errors.\nFor cosmological measurements, the data size of interest is a wide field survey from which the variance of \u03ba\ncan be measured over a range of angular scales. Thus\nthere are two angles, the first denoted \u03980 gives the size of\nthe survey, and the second is the angular scale on which\nthe variance is measured, which we will continue to denote \u03b8. Let Nf = \u039820 /\u03b82 be the number of patches of\nsize \u03b8 used in the measurement of \u03ba2 . Thus the total\nnumber of galaxies is Nt = Nf N\u03b8 . In the following we\nwill assume that the Nf patches are uncorrelated. The\ncontribution to the measured variance due to sample variance and\nintrinsic scatter\n\u0002\u221a the\n\u0003 p in the size distribution is:\nN =\n2 \u03c3\u03ba2 (\u03b8) + \u03c3i2 /N\u03b8 / Nf , where the first term is\nthe sample variance contribution assuming a Gaussian distribution, while the second is the contribution from the\nintrinsic scatter in the size distribution.\nThe S/N for the measured variance is then given by\np\nNf\nS\n2\n\u0003 .\n(8)\n= \u03c3\u03ba (\u03b8) \u0002\u221a\n2\nN\n2 \u03c3\u03ba (\u03b8) + \u03c3i2 /N\u03b8\n\nThe above estimate ignores the effect of the kurtosis on\nthe sample variance and thus underestimates the sample\n\nvariance on small scales. The effect can be estimated by\nusing the results of Takada & Jain (2002) who find that\nthe kurtosis parameter defined as S4 = h\u03ba4 i/\u03c3\u03ba6 = 3 \u00d7 104\nbetween 1\u2032 < \u03b8 < 10\u2032 and falls off on larger scales (see their\nFigure 9). In the sample variance contribution, the relevant ratio is the standard definition of kurtosis in statistics, h\u03ba4 i/\u03c3\u03ba4 , so we need to find the angular scales on\nwhich this ratio is of order unity. Over the scales of interest, \u03c3\u03ba2 \u2243 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u03b8\u22121 , where \u03b8 is in arcminutes (Jain\n& Seljak 1997). Hence we obtain h\u03ba4 i/\u03c3\u03ba4 \u2243 10/\u03b8(\u2032 ), a\nsimple expression that is sufficiently accurate for our pur< 10\u2032 , the kurtosis term is important and\npose. Thus for \u03b8 \u223c\ncould increase the sample variance by up to a factor of two.\nHowever, we will see below that the shot noise term dominates the sample variance term on scales smaller than a\nfew arcminutes. Hence it is only over a small range in\nangle, and at worst by a factor of two, that we have underestimated the sample variance. Note that analogous\nexpressions to equation 8 hold for the S/N from shape\nmeasurements (e.g. Jain & Seljak 1997; Schneider et al\n1998; Hu & Tegmark 1999).\nIt is interesting to consider the relative contributions of\nsample variance and intrinsic scatter to the noise term\nin equation 8. Again using the approximate relation\n\u03c3\u03ba2 \u221d 1/\u03b8, we see that the shot-noise term scales 1/\u03b83 ,\nwhile the sample variance scales as 1/\u03b82 . Thus on small\nscales the shot-noise term dominates, while on scales larger\nthan a few arcminutes (depending on the number density\nof galaxies) the sample variance term dominates.\nFigure 1 shows the predicted variance in size shifts and\nthe S/N expected for different survey parameters. We assume a flat \u039bCDM model with \u03c38 = 0.9 and assume that\nphotometric redshifts are available for\n\u0002 a source \u0003redshift\ndistribution of the form n(z) \u221d z 2 exp \u2212(z/z0)1.2 . Varying z0 changes the mean redshift of the distribution. The\nleft panel shows the variance in the size shift and the two\nsources of noise: the intrinsic dispersion of galaxy sizes and\nsample variance. On scales of order 1\u2032 and smaller, the intrinsic dispersion dominates, while on larger scales sample\nvariance is the main source is noise. In the right panel the\nS/N achievable with a filled survey is shown. The middle\nsolid curve assumes a number density of galaxies of 40 per\nsquare arcminute, a total area of 100 square degrees and\nan intrinsic dispersion \u03c3i = 0.5 (Narayan & Bartelmann\n1995). This curve shows that high S/N measurements can\nbe made on scales of order 0.1\u2032 \u2212 100\u2032, which corresponds\nto spatial scales of about 50 Kpc to 50 Mpc. If the level\nof systematics is not a show-stopper, then one can extend\nthe measurements to larger scales by sparse sampling. For\ngiven survey area, sparse sampling would increase the Nf\nterm on large scales. Kaiser (1998) uses a power spectrum\nanalysis to examine the best strategy for sparse sampling.\nThe lower and upper solid curves in the right panel of\nFigure 1 show the effect of changing the survey area by a\nfactor of ten - the curves shift up and down by the square\nroot of the area. The dashed and dot-dashed curves show\nthe effect on the S/N of lower galaxy number density and\nhigher mean redshift of source galaxies, respectively. If\nthe effective number density for which sizes can be measured is decreased to 20 per square arcminute, then the\nshot noise term on small scales (\u03b8 < 5\u2032 ) lowers the S/N .\nFor a higher redshift distribution of source galaxies, keeping other parameters constant, the signal is higher, so the\n\n\f4\nS/N improves on small scales as shown by the dot-dashed\ncurve. If neighboring fields are correlated, then the sample variance estimate must be revised because the effective number of independent fields of given angular size \u03b8 is\nsmaller. As discussed above, this would lower the S/N for\n\u03b8 < 10\u2032 . It is clear from the range of the effective parameters in the S/N explored here that even in a conservative\nscenario, a survey with area of order 100 square degrees\nwill provide high S/N measurements over several decades\nin length-scale.\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nWhat kind of survey would be suitable for measuring\nthe magnification effects discussed in this paper? For the\neffect of magnification on galaxy sizes, a wide area space\nbased multi-color imaging survey would be ideal. It is\nchallenging for a ground based telescope to overcome the\neffect of psf smearing on the size distribution, unless one\nhas the luxury of a large enough sample of galaxies with\nsizes larger than the psf. With appropriate multi-color\nimaging one can obtain photometric redshifts which can\nhelp reduce the scatter in measuring the size variance induced by lensing, allow one to check for intrinsic correlations in sizes and eliminate their contribution if needed.\nIt also allows for the possibility of measuring the evolution of matter clustering by binning the source galaxies in\nredshift (Jain & Seljak 1997; Hu 1999). With a psf of order 0.1 arcseconds and deep imaging, it is feasible to make\nsize measurements on of order a million galaxies over a\n10 square degree area (based on the size vs. magnitude\nmeasurements in the Hubble Deep Field by Gardner &\nSatyapal 2000). This would give adequate S/N to measure the variance of the size distribution over a few bins\nin angle ranging from 1 to 10 arcminutes.\nWith an area coverage of 100s of square degrees, which\nwould probably be feasible only with a dedicated imaging satellite such as SNAP, one can measure the projected\nmatter power spectrum to a precision of a few percent,\nmeasure higher order correlations, and ideally in combination with shear information, get useful constraints on\ncosmological parameters. On the smallest scales, crosscorrelation statistics would probe galaxy halos on scales\nof a few 10s of Kpc. By combining the magnification\nmeasurements with the shear, the density profile of halos can be measured far more accurately than with just\n\ngalaxy-galaxy lensing, which probes only the integrated\nmass within radii. Further work is needed to quantify\nthis, explore how small the scales that one can probe are,\nand check the validity of the approximation of equation 1\non these scales. Magnification effects make possible other\nuseful measures of the non-Gaussian lensing field that have\nproven difficult to obtain from shear data, such as the\nskewness of \u03ba which probes \u03a9m (Bernardeau et al 1997)\nand peak statistics which probe the mass function of halos\n(Jain & van Waerbeke 2000).\nThe cross-correlation effects of magnification on the\nnumber densities of galaxies, and of foreground galaxy position with background galaxy sizes, are in principle easier\nto measure. This is because these statistics are first order in the lensing convergence whereas the size variance\nis of second order. The interpretation is more complex in\nthat it involves the relation of a foreground galaxy population with the mass. The main requirements for accurate measurements are photometric redshifts for a large\nsample of galaxies (to separate the foreground and background galaxies), and high imaging quality as discussed\nabove. For deep imaging data that has a redshift distri> 1, an adequate dataset would enbution peaked at z \u223c\ncompass 10 square degrees, while an ideal dataset would\ncover more than a 100 square degrees. The southern strip\nof SDSS fulfills the requirements outlined above, as do\nother smaller imaging surveys that are in progress or being planned.\nIt is hoped that the discussion and results presented here\nmotivate the integration of magnification measurements as\npart of the scientific agenda of wide area imaging surveys.\nThe precise requirements for a given survey that will enable useful magnification measurements to be made need\ncareful consideration. At the same time work is needed on\nsurvey strategy, techniques for combining magnification\nand shear information, and appropriate statistical measures that can be extracted from the data.\nAcknowledgments: I would like to thank Matthias\nBartelmann, Andrew Connolly, Gary Bernstein, Jason\nRhodes, David Rusin, Alex Szalay, Masahiro Takada and\nAndy Taylor for helpful discussions.
