Introduction\nConsidering a sample of 170 optically polarized quasars\nwith accurate linear polarization measurements, Hutsem\u00e9kers\n(1998; hereafter Paper I) discovered that quasar polarization\nvectors are not randomly oriented over the sky as naturally\nexpected. Indeed, in some regions of the three-dimensional\nUniverse (i.e. in regions delimited in right ascension, declination and redshift), the quasar polarization position angles\nappear concentrated around preferential directions, suggesting the existence of very large-scale coherent orientations \u2013or\nalignments\u2013 of quasar polarization vectors.\nMainly because the polarization vectors of objects located\nalong the same line of sight but at different redshifts are not\naccordingly aligned, possible instrumental bias and contamiSend offprint requests to: hutsemekers@astro.ulg.ac.be\n\u22c6\nBased on observations collected at the European Southern\nObservatory (ESO, La Silla and Paranal)\n\u22c6\u22c6\nTable A.1 is only available electronic form at the CDS via\nanonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or\nhttp://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/\n\u22c6\u22c6\u22c6\nChercheur qualifi\u00e9 du F.N.R.S.

The very large scales at which these coherent orientations are seen suggest the presence of correlations\nin objects or fields on spatial scales up to \u223c 1 Gpc at redshift\nz \u2243 1\u20132, possibly unveiling a new effect of cosmological importance. The interpretation of such large-scale correlations is\ndifficult within the concordance cosmological model and might\npoint at missing ingredients. Ongoing theoretical works (e.g.\nDas et al. 2005) offer interesting avenues indicating that we\nmight detect a property of dark matter or dark energy.\nIn order to further study the reality of this alignment effect,\nwe have subsequently carried out a very simple test which consisted in obtaining new polarimetric measurements for quasars\nlocated in a region of the sky where the range of their polarization position angles was predicted in advance on the basis\nof the results of Paper I. These measurements, presented in\nHutsem\u00e9kers & Lamy (2001; hereafter Paper II), independently\nconfirmed the existence of coherent orientations of quasar polarization vectors in the considered region of the sky. Statistical\ntests applied to the whole sample of 213 objects indicate that\nthe quasar polarization angles are not uniformly distributed\nwith a significance level (i.e. the probability that the observed\n\n\f2\n\nHutsem\u00e9kers D. et al.: Mapping extreme-scale alignments of quasar polarization vectors\n\nstatistic is due to chance) between 10\u22122 and 10\u22123 . These results\nwere confirmed by Jain et al. (2004) using coordinate-invariant\nstatistics.\nIn order to have an accurate and complete description of\nthe phenomenon, a large number of new polarization measurements is needed. We have then carried out new polarimetric observations which, combined to recent data from the literature,\nlead to a new sample of 355 polarized quasars with accurate\nlinear polarization measurements. In the following, we present\na comprehensive analysis of this new sample. The characteristics of the sample are described in Sect. 2. The results of the\nstatistical analysis are given in Sect. 3 and maps of the strongest\nalignments are illustrated in Sect. 4. Possible contamination by\ninterstellar polarization in our Galaxy is discussed in details\nin Sect. 5. The properties of the alignments are investigated in\nSect. 6, and possible interpretations in Sect. 7. A preliminary\naccount of this work is reported in Cabanac et al. (2005).\n\n2. The new sample\nThe polarimetric observations were carried out at the European\nSouthern Observatory (Chile) during five runs in the period August 2000 \u2013 October 2003, using the 3.6m telescope equipped with EFOSC2 in La Silla and the Very Large\nTelescope equipped with FORS1 in Paranal. A detailed account\nof the observations, data reduction and final measurements is\ngiven in Sluse et al. (2005), including tests for possible biases in the data. In total, 184 new, mostly V-band, polarization measurements were obtained for quasars1 located at high\ngalactic latitudes (|bII| \u2265 30\u25e6 ) in both the North Galactic Pole\n(NGP) and the South Galactic Pole (SGP) regions. The median uncertainty of the polarization degree is \u2243 0.25%. The targets were mainly selected from the V\u00e9ron catalogue (V\u00e9ronCetty & V\u00e9ron 2001) and from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\nEarly and First Data Releases (Schneider et al. 2002, 2003,\nReichard et al. 2003). Bright objects were preferred, as well\nas Broad Absorption Line (BAL), radio-loud and red quasars\nwhich are usually more polarized (Hutsem\u00e9kers et al. 1998,\nImpey & Tapia 1990, Smith et al. 2002). Special emphasis has\nbeen given to the observation of quasars located in the direction of the previously identified regions of polarization vector\nalignments, i.e. region A1 located in the NGP region and delimited in (B1950) right ascensions and redshift by 11h 15m \u2264\n\u03b1 \u2264 14h 29m and 1.0 \u2264 z \u2264 2.3, and region A3 located in\nthe SGP region and delimited by 21h 20m \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 24h 00m and\n0.7 \u2264 z \u2264 1.5. These limits in right ascension and redshift\nwere fixed visually in Paper I; it must be emphasized that they\nonly roughly delineate the true regions of polarization vector\nalignments which, ultimately, should be identified more quantitatively.\nThe observations were performed with multiple goals in\nmind: (1) to reassess the significance of the alignments seen\ntowards the SGP region A3 as done in Paper II for the NGP region A1; (2) to increase the sampling over the high-redshift region A1 where the strongest alignments are measured and to re1\n\nIn this paper we use indifferently the terms \"quasar\" or \"QSO\" for\noptically or radio selected quasi-stellar objects.\n\nFig. 1. The redshift distribution of the sample of 355 quasars,\nillustrated for the NGP and the SGP regions separately.\n\nfine its size by investigating the alignment in a sub-region; and\n(3) to increase the sampling in the foreground regions known\nto behave differently as shown in Paper I and II.\nIn the meantime, Smith et al. (2002) have published new,\nmostly unfiltered, polarization measurements for a sample of\n\u223c 70 near-infrared selected QSOs. These objects are added to\nour sample. Most of them are at redshifts z \u2264 0.5. We also\nrealized that new redshift measurements were available for a\nfew quasars from the Impey & Tapia (1990) sample used in\nPaper I, adding 8 objects to the final sample.\nAs in Paper I and II, we only consider objects which fulfil\nthe criteria p \u2265 0.6%, \u03c3\u03b8 \u2264 14\u25e6 , and |bII | \u2265 30\u25e6 , where p is the\npolarization degree and \u03c3\u03b8 the uncertainty of the polarization\nposition angle \u03b8. These constraints ensure that most objects are\nsignificantly and intrinsically polarized with little contamination by the Galaxy, and that the polarization position angles are\nmeasured with a reasonable accuracy (cf. Paper I for additional\ndetails). If an object has been observed more than once, only\nthe best value is kept i.e. the measurement with the smallest\nuncertainty \u03c3 p on the polarization degree. Objects flagged as\ncontaminated in Sluse et al. (2005) are discarded.\nCombining the new data with the sample of 213 objects\nfrom Paper II, the final sample of polarized quasars then\namounts to 355 objects distributed all over the sky (195 in\nthe NGP region and 160 in the SGP region). The full data\nset is given in Appendix A. The redshift distribution is illustrated in Fig. 1; it shows a good sampling within the range\n0 \u2264 z \u2264 2.4. The distribution of the polarization degree is illustrated in Fig. 2.\n\n\fHutsem\u00e9kers D. et al.: Mapping extreme-scale alignments of quasar polarization vectors\n\n3\n\nTable 1.

Statistical analysis\n\n3.1. Local statistics\nIn this first series of tests we follow the approach of Paper II,\ni.e. we test the hypothesis that the polarization position angles2\nof quasars located in a given region of the sky preferentially\nlie in the interval [\u03b81 \u2212 \u03b82 ] instead of being uniformly distributed. This angular sector as well as the region of the sky\nare selected prior to the new observations, namely on the basis of the results of Paper I. The polarization position angles\nare measured for a sample of quasars different from that one\nat the origin of the detection of the effect. To test the null hypothesis of uniform distribution of circular data against the alternative of sectoral preference, we use a simple binomial test\n(e.g. Lehmacher & Lienert 1980, Siegel 1956). If PA is the\nprobability under the null hypothesis that a polarization angle\nfalls in the angular sector [\u03b81 \u2212 \u03b82 ], then PA = \u2206\u03b8/180\u25e6 where\n\u2206\u03b8 = (\u03b82 \u2212 \u03b81 ) mod 180. If N denotes the number of polarization angles falling in [\u03b81 \u2212\u03b82 ] out of N0 measurements in a given\nregion of the sky, N has a binomial distribution under the null\nhypothesis and the probability to have N\u22c6 or more polarization\nposition angles in [\u03b81 \u2212 \u03b82 ] is\n!\nN0\nX\nN0\nPAl (1 \u2212 PA )N0 \u2212l .\n(1)\nPbin =\nl\nl=N\u22c6\n\nThe results of the test are given in Table 1. For region A1\nwe essentially repeat the analysis of Paper II with additional\ndata: out of 40 quasars3 in region A1, 27 have their polarization angles in the predicted range [146\u25e6\u2013 46\u25e6 ] (\u2206\u03b8 = 80\u25e6 ; this\nrange has been defined in Paper I). The hypothesis of an uniform distribution of the polarization position angles is rejected\n2\nThe polarization position angle (or polarization angle) \u03b8 is expressed in degrees from 0\u25e6 to 180\u25e6 and counted from North to East.\nPolarization vectors (pseudo-vectors in fact) refer to segments of arbitrary length or normalized on the polarization degree, centered at the\nobject position and with a direction fixed by the polarization angle.\n3\nAlthough B1222+228 and B1246\u2212047 have recent, better, measurements reported in Table A.1, these objects were already considered in Paper I and are then discarded from the new sample.\n\nNew sample\nN\u22c6 / N0\nPbin\n\nFull sample\nN\u22c6 / N0\nPbin\n\nA1\n\np \u2265 0.6%\np \u2265 1.0%\np \u2265 2.0%\np \u2265 3.0%\n\n27/40\n15/22\n5/6\n5/5\n\n2.8 10\u22123\n2.1 10\u22122\n6.6 10\u22122\n1.7 10\u22122\n\n42/56\n27/34\n7/8\n6/6\n\n3.3 10\u22126\n3.4 10\u22125\n1.7 10\u22122\n7.7 10\u22123\n\nA1+\n\np \u2265 0.6%\np \u2265 1.0%\n\n13/14\n8/8\n\n2.2 10\u22124\n1.5 10\u22123\n\n17/18\n12/12\n\n1.1 10\u22125\n5.9 10\u22125\n\nA3\n\np \u2265 0.6%\np \u2265 1.0%\np \u2265 2.0%\np \u2265 3.0%\n\n14/18\n9/11\n6/7\n6/7\n\n4.3 10\u22123\n1.3 10\u22122\n3.3 10\u22122\n3.3 10\u22122\n\n24/29\n17/20\n12/13\n9/10\n\n2.6 10\u22125\n2.3 10\u22124\n4.6 10\u22124\n4.1 10\u22123\n\nat the 0.3% level of significance, which is one order of magnitude smaller than in Paper II. Samples with higher cutoff values\nof the polarization degree p are also considered. They show\nsimilar departures to uniformity, indicating that the observed\nalignments are not only due to the quasars with the smallest polarization levels. For completeness we also provide in Table 1\nthe numbers for the full sample, i.e. including the data from\nPaper I. In this case the probability must be seen with caution\nsince the full sample includes objects at the origin of the detection of the effect.\nAs pointed out in Paper I and II, the polarization vector\nalignment seems stronger in the inner part of region A1. We\nhave then defined a smaller region within A1, denoted A1+,\nand delimited a priori by 12h 00m \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 13h 20m and 1.3 \u2264\nz \u2264 2.0. Quasars were observed both inside and outside this\nregion. As seen in Table 1, nearly all objects located in region\nA1+ have their polarization angles in the range [146\u25e6\u2013 46\u25e6 ]. A\ncomparison with the results for the full A1 region indicates that\nmost of the significance is coming from the inner region A1+.\nThis supports the fact that this alignment occurs within a well\ndefined region of the sky. At the same time this illustrates the\ndifficulty of properly fixing its border.\nOne of the goal of the new observations was to confirm the\npolarization vector alignment in region A3 which is roughly\nopposite to A1 on the sky. In Paper I, we have noted that the\npolarization angles of the quasars in region A3 were between\n103\u25e6 and 144\u25e6 . If we consider a realistic \u2206\u03b8 = 80\u25e6 as for region\nA1, we then expect that the polarization angles of quasars located in region A3 will preferentially fall in the angular sector\n[84\u25e6 \u2013 164\u25e6 ]. Out of 18 new polarized quasars in this region, 14\nare aligned as expected and the hypothesis of an uniform distribution of the polarization position angles may be rejected at\nthe 0.4% level of significance in favour of coherent orientation.\nThis confirms the existence of large-scale polarization vector\nalignments also for those quasars located in the SGP region\nA3.\n\n3.2. Global statistics\nGlobal statistical tests may be applied to the whole sample to\ndetect coherent orientations of polarization vectors in some re-\n\n\f4\n\nHutsem\u00e9kers D. et al.: Mapping extreme-scale alignments of quasar polarization vectors\n\nFig. 3. The logarithmic significance level of the statistical tests\napplied to the sample of 355 quasars. nV is the number of nearest neighbours around each quasar and involved in the calculation of the statistics.\n\ngions of the sky. Such tests are described in details in Paper I.\nBasically, the statistics measure the dispersion of the polarization position angles for groups of nV nearest neighbours in\nthe 3-dimensional space, summed over all objects in the sample. The significance is evaluated through Monte-Carlo simulations, shuffling angles over positions. A weakness of the tests\nused in Paper I was their dependency upon the coordinate system. Jain et al. (2004) made them coordinate-invariant by incorporating the parallel transport of polarization vectors.\nIn the following we consider the SD and the Zcm tests presented in Paper I. Although it is more sensitive, we do not use\nhere the S test because it requires an additional parameter. The\ntests incorporating parallel transport are denoted pSD , and pZcm .\nThe significance levels (SL) of the statistical tests, i.e. the probabilities that the test statistics would have been exceeded by\nchance only, are computed on the basis of 104 permutations.\nWhen the significance level is smaller than 10\u22124 we used up\nto 105 simulations. Significance levels are given in Fig. 3 for\nthe new sample of 355 quasars against the number of nearest\nneighbours nV involved in the calculation of the statistics.\nCompared to our previous results (Paper I and II), all the\nstatistical tests indicate a net decrease of the significance level \u2013\nwell below 10\u22123 \u2013 for the new, larger, sample (see also Cabanac\net al. 2005 for a comparison). This definitely confirms that\nquasar polarization vectors are not randomly distributed over\nthe sky but coherently oriented in groups of & 40 objects, i.e.\non Gpc scales at redshift z \u223c 1. With the increase of the number\nof objects, we note a shift of the minimum significance level towards higher nV . Tests with and without parallel transport show\nrather similar results. This is due to the fact that the groups\nof quasars strongly contributing to the significance are located\nat low declinations (cf. Sect. 4), i.e. at positions on the celestial sphere where the corrections for parallel transport remain\nsmall.\n\nFig. 4. Hammer-Aitoff projection of the Zcm (top) and SD (bottom) statistics averaged over nV = 37 to 43, as a function of\nthe equatorial coordinates \u03b1 p and \u03b4 p of the northern pole of an\narbitrary coordinate system. The less significant the statistics\nfor a given coordinate system or pole position, the darker the\ncorresponding (\u03b1 p , \u03b4 p ) point in the map. Note that (\u03b1 p + 180\u25e6,\n\u03b4 p ) is equivalent to (\u03b1 p , \u2212\u03b4 p ). The full sample of 355 QSOs is\nused.\nAs shown in Paper I, the results of the SD and Zcm tests depend on the adopted coordinate system because the polarization\nposition angles are defined with respect to meridians. When\nprojected onto the equatorial part of the celestial sphere, alignments of polarization vectors are preserved and well detected\nby the tests. On the contrary, if one chooses a coordinate system with a pole located just in the middle of aligned objects,\nthe polarization angles will range from 0\u25e6 to 180\u25e6 and no coherent orientation can be detected by the tests. While the parallel transport of polarization vectors solves this problem, it is\nnevertheless interesting to see for which coordinate systems the\nsignificance is extreme. To investigate this, we have computed\nthe statistics for various coordinate systems, each one being\ncharacterized by a northern pole of equatorial coordinates \u03b1 p ,\n\u03b4 p (see Paper I for details and transformation formulae). The\nresults of these calculations are illustrated in Fig. 4. First, they\nconfirm that the significance is not extreme in the equatorial\ncoordinate system (\u03b4 p = 90\u25e6 ) and that many systems of coordinates do provide more significant statistics, a conclusion\nalready reached in Paper I. Interestingly, the statistics show the\nlowest significance when using a coordinate system of northern\npole \u03b1 p \u2243 0\u25e6 and \u03b4 p \u2243 \u221210\u25e6 (which is equivalent to \u03b1 p \u2243 12h ,\n\u03b4 p \u2243 +10\u25e6 ). The location of this pole corresponds to the centers of regions A1 and A3 which are roughly opposite on the\n\n\fHutsem\u00e9kers D. et al.: Mapping extreme-scale alignments of quasar polarization vectors\n\nFig. 5. Same as Fig. 3 but for two sub-samples with different\ncutoffs of the polarization degree. When SL is smaller than\n10\u22125 (i.e. unresolved with 105 simulations), we arbitrarily fix\nits value to SL = 8 10\u22126 .\nsky4 . Since putting a polar axis at this location scrambles the\nmost significant alignments, this clearly suggests that regions\nA1 and A3 are major contributors to the global significance.\nThis is independently verified by considering the sample with\nand without the 183 objects along the \"A1\u2013A3 axis\" (as defined\nin Sect. 4): while a strong departure to uniformity is observed\nwhen only those quasars belonging to the A1\u2013A3 region are\nconsidered, no significant effect is detected when these objects\nare removed from the sample.\nIn Fig. 5, we give the significance levels of the tests considering two sub-samples with cuts on the polarization degree. If\nonly low-polarization (p \u2264 2%) quasars are considered, the de4\nWhen projected onto the sky, the center of region A1 is close to\nthe center of the Local Supercluster (Paper II). The position (\u03b1 p \u2243 12h ,\n\u03b4 p \u2243 +10\u25e6 ) is within a few degrees from the Virgo cluster, known to\nbe at the center of the Local Supercluster (e.g. Vall\u00e9e 2002).\n\n5\n\nparture to uniformity from the Zcm and pZcm tests is stronger than\nin the full sample. For the p \u2265 1% sub-sample, the departure to\nuniformity becomes weakly significant. These results are consistent with those obtained by Jain et al. (2004), although the\ndifferences we note within our new sample are not as strong\nas theirs. These differences may indicate that the alignment effect is more efficient for the low polarization quasars than for\nthe high polarization ones. Another reason could be a blurring\nof the alignments by the high polarization quasars due to the\nfact that these objects are often variable in both polarization\ndegree and angle (e.g. Impey & Tapia 1990, a good example\nbeing PKS 1216\u2212010 discussed in Sluse et al. 2005). However\nthis behavior seems at odds with the results from local statistics (Table 1) which indicate that high polarization objects are\naligned as the low polarization ones, namely in regions A1 and\nA3. In fact it is important to realize that cutting at p \u2265 1%\nremoves proportionally more objects located in the regions of\nstrong alignment A1 and A3 than outside these regions, which\nresults in a decrease of the global significance. Inversely, cutting at p \u2264 2% removes proportionally less objects within these\nregions, then increasing the global significance. The fact that\nmore low-polarization objects lie in regions A1 and A3 is partly\ndue to the way we have selected the objects. For example, when\nwe got additional data to confirm the alignment in region A1,\nwe preferentially observed BAL QSOs whose polarization levels peak close to 1% (Hutsem\u00e9kers & Lamy 2002, Schmidt &\nHines 1999). Due to such intricate selection effects, the results\nof the tests applied to sub-samples must be seen with caution.\nThe same kind of bias occurs when we cut on redshift. Jain\net al. (2004) have divided the sample of 213 objects between\nz \u2265 1 and z \u2264 1.3. With pSD -type tests, they have noted a\nstronger alignment effect in the high redshift sub-sample, and\nno alignment at all in the low redshift one. In fact, when building the sample of 213 objects presented in Paper II, we have\nmainly added high-redshift objects in region A1, while in the\ncurrent paper we also add many objects at lower redshifts. As\na consequence, when cutting in redshift the new sample of 355\nobjects, the differences of significance between the low and\nhigh redshift sub-samples are not as strong as those reported\nby Jain et al. (2004). Namely, the tests applied to the new data\ndo not indicate a much higher significance in the high-redshift\nsample, and a clear signal is seen in the low-redshift one. Cuts\non redshift are further discussed in the next section.\n\n3.3. Semi-global statistics\nWithin the sample of 355 quasars, the polarization angles do\nnot appear uniformly distributed, namely when applying a cut\non redshift as shown in Fig. 6 (see also Figs. 7 & 8) . The\nisotropy of the histograms are analysed using the HawleyPeebles statistical test which also provides an estimate of the\npreferred orientations.\nThe Hawley-Peebles Fourier method (Hawley & Peebles\n1975; see also Paper I) is based on fitting the observed distribution by a model of the form N(\u03b8i ) = N (1 + \u22061 cos 2\u03b8i +\n\u22062 sin 2\u03b8i ) where N is the mean number of objects per bin\n(we adopt 18 bins); \u22061 and \u22062 denote the coefficients of\n\n\f6\n\nHutsem\u00e9kers D. et al.: Mapping extreme-scale alignments of quasar polarization vectors\n\nTable 2.

The labels refer to the samples defined in Table 2.\n\nthe wave model which describe the degree of deviation from\nisotropy. The probability that the total amplitude \u2206 = (\u220621 +\n\u220622 )1/2 exceeds some chosen value is computed to be PHP\n= exp (\u22120.25 n \u22062) where n is the number of objects in the\nsample. The preferred orientation is calculated from \u03b8 =\n0.5 arctan (\u22062 /\u22061 ). Results are given in Table 2 for the subsamples illustrated in Fig. 6. We also used the Rayleigh test\n(e.g. Fisher 1993) which is very similar and gives nearly identical results.\nThe most remarkable result from Fig. 6 and Table 2 is\nthat both the low and high redshift quasar samples show nonuniform distributions of their polarization angles and different\npreferred directions. The weak anisotropy in the all-z sample\nreflects the relative proportion of the various sub-samples. In\nthe NGP region (bII \u2265 +30\u25e6 ), the all-z sample is essentially randomly oriented while the low- and high-z samples have very\ndifferent distributions. The situation is less clear for the SGP\nregion (bII \u2264 \u221230\u25e6 ): while a definite anisotropy is seen in the\nlow-z sample, the evidence for a different preferred direction\nin the high-z sample is weak, possibly due to the smaller sample. It should be emphasized that this behavior does not mean\nthat all quasars at high or low redshifts have their polarization\nvectors coherently aligned. Indeed, the observed anisotropy is\nmainly due to the objects located in the regions of alignment\nwhich have been preferentially targetted, as verified by running\nthe test after removing these objects.\n\n3.4. Statistical tests: summary\nThe new sample of 355 quasars has been analysed using various, complementary, statistical methods. All of them concur to\nindicate that quasars polarization vectors are definitely not randomly oriented but coherently oriented over very large spatial\nscales. With respect to previous work, the probability that the\nalignments are due to chance is definitely lower, often smaller\nthan 10\u22123 .\n\nAll\nz \u2264 1.3\nz \u2265 1.3\nbII \u2265 +30\u25e6\nbII \u2265 +30\u25e6 , z \u2264 1.3\nbII \u2265 +30\u25e6 , z \u2265 1.3\nbII \u2264 \u221230\u25e6\nbII \u2264 \u221230\u25e6 , z \u2264 1.3\nbII \u2264 \u221230\u25e6 , z \u2265 1.3\n\nn\n355\n211\n144\n195\n118\n77\n160\n93\n67\n\n\u03b8 (\u25e6 )\n\nPHP\n\u22122\n\n2.6 10\n2.9 10\u22124\n8.9 10\u22124\n8.2 10\u22121\n4.7 10\u22123\n4.9 10\u22123\n1.9 10\u22123\n4.2 10\u22123\n4.6 10\u22122\n\n128\n104\n165\n107\n90\n175\n132\n119\n151\n\nTowards the NGP, we confirm the high significance of the\nalignment seen in the high-redshift region A1. A significant\nalignment \u2013with a different preferred direction\u2013 is also detected\nat lower redshift (see also Fig. 7). In the SGP region, we confirm the alignment previously suspected in region A3. These\nregions appear as major contributors to the global significance.\nDue to its restricted extension in redshift and heterogeneous\ndensity, the present sampling does not allow us to study the statistical properties of alignment structures over large volumes.\nYet we see clear trends for alignments with different preferred\ndirections to occur in well-defined, although loosely delimited,\nregions of the sky. Further characterization will require a denser\nand larger sampling.\n\n4. Maps of the alignments\nIn Fig. 7 and 8, we illustrate the regions where the quasar polarization vector alignments are the most significant. As already\ndiscussed, the borders of these regions are not clearcut. This is\nespecially true in the SGP region where several quasars with\nright ascensions between 0\u25e6 and 40\u25e6 seem to have their polarization vectors aligned too, at least in some redshift ranges.\nHowever, because the spatial sampling is still poor out of the\nline of sight to regions A1 and A3, we choose to essentially\nstick to the limits adopted in Paper I.\nTowards the NGP (Fig. 7), polarization vector alignments\nare seen for both the low and high redshift samples5 . The average directions are definitely different: \u03b8 \u2243 79\u25e6 at low-z and\n\u03b8 \u2243 8\u25e6 at high-z (with PHP = 3 10\u22123 and PHP = 2 10\u22123, respectively). The alignment in the SGP region A3 (0.7 \u2264 z \u2264 1.5) is\nalso clearly seen, including for the higher polarization objects\n(Fig. 8). The preferred direction is \u03b8 \u2243 128\u25e6 (PHP = 6 10\u22125 ). No\nsignificant departure to random orientations is seen in the lower\nor the higher redshift SGP regions. One might suspect in the\nhigh-z region an alignment with a preferred direction different\nfrom the mid-z one, but it is not significant. However, if we only\nconsider the 15 high-z objects with p \u2265 1.2%, we have a weak\n5\nThe low redshift region was not analysed in Sect. 3.1 because it\nwas not defined a priori (it overlaps but differs from the region A2\ndefined in Paper I). It is nevertheless interesting to note that out of 43\npolarized quasars in that region, 35 have their polarization angle in\nthe range [30\u25e6 \u2013 120\u25e6 ] (cf. Fig. 7). This corresponds to Pbin = 2.1 10\u22125 .\nWith p \u2265 1% (p \u2265 2%), 24 (13) quasars out of 30 (16) have their\npolarization angle in that range and Pbin = 7.2 10\u22124 (1.1 10\u22122 ).\n\n\fHutsem\u00e9kers D. et al.: Mapping extreme-scale alignments of quasar polarization vectors\n\n7\n\nFig. 7.

If we assume that the field\nstar polarization correctly represents the interstellar polarization affecting more distant objects, then interstellar polarization\nin our Galaxy was shown to have little effect on the polarization\nangle distribution of significantly polarized (p \u2265 0.6%) quasars\n(Sluse et al. 2005).\n\n\f8\n\nHutsem\u00e9kers D. et al.: Mapping extreme-scale alignments of quasar polarization vectors\n\nFig. 10.

Fig. 9 illustrates\npolarization maps and distributions for the stars best matching the positions of the quasars represented in Fig. 7 and 8.\nFor each quasar, we plot the angularly closest star on the sky\nlocated at a heliocentric distance d\u22c6 \u2265 100 pc and with an uncertainty on the polarization angle \u03c3\u03b8\u22c6 \u2264 14\u25e6 ; if this star is already used, we plot the second nearest, etc, making sure that all\nstars are different. Ideally one should use the most distant stars.\nHowever, if we increase the minimum stellar distance, the number density of stars in the catalogue strongly decreases and the\nmean angular distance to the quasars becomes larger. To keep\nstars within a few degrees from the quasars, we adopt d\u22c6 \u2265\n100 pc as a good compromise. In fact, choosing higher distance\ncutoffs has little effect on the polarization angle distributions;\nonly the polarization degrees are slightly shifted towards higher\nvalues when more distant stars are used. As seen in Fig. 9, the\npolarization angles are clearly concentrated around two preferred directions: \u03b8\u22c6 \u2243 64\u25e6 in the NGP region and \u03b8\u22c6 \u2243 128\u25e6\nin the SGP region. These mean directions are typical of high\n\ngalactic latitude regions of the sky (Berdyugin et al. 2004, Sluse\net al. 2005) and do not critically depend on the \u03b1, \u03b4 bounds.\nTo compare quasar and stellar polarization angles, we have\nfirst computed the difference \u2206\u03b8 between the polarization position angles of a quasar and its nearest star: \u2206\u03b8 = 90\u25e6 \u2212 |90\u25e6 \u2212\n|\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u22c6 ||, where \u03b8 refers to the quasar polarization angle and \u03b8\u22c6\nto the stellar one. Distributions of \u2206\u03b8 are illustrated in Fig. 10.\nIf quasar polarization vectors are aligned according to interstellar polarization, one may expect a strong clustering at small\n\u2206\u03b8. Such a clustering is not observed, indicating the absence\nof significant correlations between quasar and interstellar polarizations (only a weak 2 \u03c3 deviation is seen in the first bin of\none of the histograms).\nWe can also directly compare the trends seen in Fig. 9 to\nthe quasar polarization vector alignments observed in Figs. 7\nand 8. Towards the NGP, the orientation of the alignment in the\nhigh-redshift region A1 appears completely different from the\ndirection of the interstellar polarization. But, on the contrary,\nthe mean direction of the lower redshift alignment is rather similar to that one of the interstellar polarization, suggesting that it\nmight be due to polarization by dust grains in our Galaxy, although the distributions somewhat differ and more particularly\nthe peak seen at \u03b8 \u2243 110\u25e6 in the quasar polarization angle distribution. Simple simulations show that, apart from this peak, the\nclustering in the distribution of low-z quasar polarization angles\ncan be corrected by subtracting a strong (mean p\u22c6 \u2243 0.7%) interstellar polarization at \u03b8\u22c6 \u2243 64\u25e6 . The fact that higher than\nobserved interstellar polarization is needed to randomize the\nquasar polarization angles is not supported by the observations\nof distant stars (Berdyugin et al. 2004) nor by the polarization measurements of (a few) field galaxies (Sluse et al. 2005).\nHowever, it cannot be rejected since little is known on the interstellar polarization of very distant objects. The fact that interstellar polarization could be at the origin of the low-z alignment\n\n\fHutsem\u00e9kers D. et al.: Mapping extreme-scale alignments of quasar polarization vectors\n\nis nevertheless difficult to understand since low and high redshift quasars are located on similar lines of sight and then must\nsuffer the same interstellar polarization, at least on average.\nOne might argue that low redshift quasars are systematically\nless polarized than high redshift ones and then more affected\nby interstellar polarization. But this interpretation is ruled out\nby the fact that polarization degrees do not differ in the low and\nhigh redshift quasar samples6 (Fig. 7). Furthermore, highly polarized quasars follow the low-z alignment and low polarization ones follow the high-z alignment. It should be emphasized\nthat very highly polarized quasars do follow the low-z alignment: for example, out of the 7 low-z quasars with p \u2265 7%,\n6 have 30\u25e6 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 120\u25e6 . A similar behavior is observed towards the SGP (Fig. 8). The mean orientation of the polarization alignment seen for intermediate redshift quasars coincides\nwith the direction of the interstellar polarization in the SGP,\nwhile objects at lower or higher redshifts on the same line of\nsight show essentially random polarization angle distributions\n(even weakly oriented at a different \u03b8 at high-z). Any correction randomizing the mid-z polarization angle distribution induces a reverse concentration in the distributions of low and\nhigh-z quasar polarization angles. And, again, the polarization\ndegrees do not depend on redshift, and the quasars with higher\npolarization do follow the mid-z alignment (Table 1).\nFinally, we have considered pairs of quasars, i.e. quasars at\nsmall angular distances from each other, independently of their\nredshift. If interstellar polarization dominates, both quasars\nshould be similarly affected such that the acute angle \u2206\u03b8 between their polarization angles is expected to cluster at small\n\u2206\u03b8. Using angular distances less than 1\u25e6 and 2\u25e6 (smaller distances result in too few quasar pairs), we find no concentration\nat small \u2206\u03b8, either in the full sample or in the A1\u2013A3 region,\nor when only considering the low-polarization (p \u2264 2%) objects more likely to be affected by interstellar polarization (to\nfix the ideas, with p \u2264 2%, there are 17 quasar pairs with angular separations \u2264 1\u25e6 and 61 pairs with angular separations \u2264\n2 \u25e6 among the full sample of 355 quasars).\nIt is therefore very implausible that interstellar polarization is at the origin of the observed polarization vector alignments. Most probably, there is a small \u2013normal\u2013 contamination by interstellar polarization, compatible with field star measurements, and which possibly slightly enhances those intrinsic\nalignments having a similar orientation. Given that the alignments are characterized by a broad range of polarization angles\naround a preferred direction, the chance for a coincidence is\n\n9\n\nnot small, especially if the mean quasar polarization angle rotates as a function redshift as shown in the next section. The\nfact that, when cutting at p \u2265 1.2% in Figs. 7 and 8, quasars\nwith \u03b8 \u2243 64\u25e6 (\u03b8 \u2243 128\u25e6) are preferentially removed in the low-z\nNGP region (SGP region) possibly supports this view (cf. also\nthe first bin at \u2206\u03b8 \u2264 10\u25e6 in Fig. 10). Spectropolarimetric data\nare in agreement with this interpretation. Indeed, while a significant contamination by interstellar polarization would produce a definite rotation of the polarization angle as a function of\nwavelength, quasars usually show polarization angles constant\n(i.e. within a few degrees) with wavelength, including objects\nlocated in the regions of alignments (Impey et al. 1995, Ogle et\nal. 1999, Schmidt & Smith 2000, Smith et al. 2003, Kishimoto\net al. 2004). In the few quasars for which such a rotation is\nobserved, corrections to polarization angles do not exceed 10\u25e6\n(Kishimoto et al. 2004).\nIn conclusion, interstellar polarization can definitely not explain the polarization vector alignments seen towards the NGP\nand more particularly that one observed in the high redshift\nregion A1. Towards the SGP, it is also unlikely that interstellar polarization is at the origin of the observed alignment, but,\ngiven the unusual nature of the effect, more data are needed for\na definite proof, namely by observing quasars at redshifts \u2265 1.5\nwhere a different orientation is suspected.\nFor the sake of completeness, it should be noticed that interstellar dust grains are also linearly birefringent, such that the\ninterstellar medium can be seen as a weak wave-plate (Martin\n1974, Lucas 2003). Should quasars be circularly polarized, the\ninterstellar medium may, under some circumstances, align their\npolarization vectors along a mean direction offsetted with respect to that one of a purely dichroic interstellar medium due\nto the conversion of circular polarization into linear polarization. While quite appealing, this mechanism cannot explain the\nquasar polarization vector alignments. Indeed, the retardance is\nvery small, roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than that\nof a quarter-wave plate (Martin 1972). Also, quasars are not\nor very weakly circularly polarized (Landstreet & Angel 1972,\nImpey et al. 1995), including a few objects belonging to the regions of alignment A1 and A3. And, finally, should this effect\nproduce the alignments, it would imply either left-handed or\nright-handed circular polarization for most quasars in a given\nregion of alignment, i.e. still a high degree of organization on\nvery large spatial scales.\n\n6\n\nThere are several reasons which could have explained such a difference and worth to keep in mind. The first one is that different types\nof quasars dominate the low and high redshift sub-samples. Indeed,\nBAL QSOs are rarely detected at z \u2264 1.3 such that there are proportionally more BAL quasars at high-z than at low-z. The reverse is true\nfor radio-loud quasars and the fact that strongly polarized (p \u2265 5%)\nquasars are more often found among radio-loud objects is marginally\nseen in the low-z distribution of the polarization degree (Figs. 7 & 8).\nAnother reason is the fact that, when measuring the polarization either\nthrough a given filter or in white light, one samples a bluer region of\nthe quasar rest-frame spectrum for high redshift objects than for low\nredshift ones. A wavelength dependent quasar polarization would then\nalso appear redshift dependent.\n\n6. Characterizing the alignment effect\nIn this section, we explore some characteristics of the alignment effect with the goal to empirically derive constraints on\npossible interpretations. We first focus on the redshift dependence of the alignments. Then, we investigate whether quasars\nwith aligned polarization vectors are located along a preferential axis, or not. Finally, we discuss correlations with quasar\nintrinsic properties.\n\n\f10\n\nHutsem\u00e9kers D. et al.: Mapping extreme-scale alignments of quasar polarization vectors\n\nFig. 11. The local statistics si of the pSD and pZcm tests computed with nV = 40 are represented here as a function of the\nredshift. The full sample of 355 quasars is considered. The\nsi , which have been multiplied by a constant factor for convenience, are averaged over redshift bins \u2206z = 0.5; the error\nbars represent the uncertainty of the mean. The highest values\nof si indicate the strongest departures to uniform distributions\nof polarization angles. The line joins the mean si values from\nthe pSD and pZcm tests. Since the si are computed for nV = 40,\nthe data points are not independent. Redshifts are counted positively for objects located in the North Galactic Cap and negatively for those ones in the South Galactic Cap. The histograms\ngive the number of quasars in each redshift bin.\n\n6.1. The redshift dependence of the alignment effect\n6.1.1. Regularly spaced alignments?\nWhen computing the global statistics in Sect. 3.2, a local statistic S i is defined for each object i and its nV neighbours. It is\nevaluated for the original data, S i\u22c6 , as well as for every simulation. We may then calculate < S i >, the average over the whole\nset of simulations, and \u03c3i , the corresponding standard deviation, such that the quantity si \u221d | < S i > \u2212S i\u22c6 | /\u03c3i provides a\nmeasure of the local departure to an uniform distribution of polarization angles. For the S -type tests, only small values of S i\u22c6\nindicate coherent orientations and si is set to zero when S i\u22c6 is\nlarger than < S i >. For the Z-type tests, si is set to zero when\nS i\u22c6 is smaller than < S i > (cf. Paper I for details).\nIn Fig. 11, we plot the quantity si , averaged over redshift\nbins, as a function of the redshift. The full sample of 355\nquasars is considered. si is computed from the pSD and pZcm\ntests with nV = 40. The SD and Zcm tests, not represented here,\ngive similar results. For both statistical tests, the run of si with\nredshift shows a cyclic behavior suggesting a regular alternance\nof regions of aligned and randomly oriented polarization vectors. The minima at z \u2243 0.7 towards the SGP and z \u2243 1.2\ntowards the NGP correspond to transition redshifts discussed\nin previous sections. It must be emphasized that adjacent data\npoints are not independent due to the fact that the statistics si\nare evaluated using nV = 40 nearest neighbours.\n\nFig. 12. Same as Fig. 11, except that a comoving distance scale\nis used and that only those quasars along the A1\u2013A3 axis are\nconsidered. Redshifts are transformed into comoving distances\nusing r = 6 (1 \u2212 (1 + z)\u22121/2 ) h\u22121 Gpc, where h is the Hubble\nconstant in units of 100 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 . Bin size is \u2206r = 0.4 h\u22121\nGpc. Distances are counted positively for objects located in the\nNorth Galactic Cap and negatively for those ones in the South\nGalactic Cap.\n\nThe redshift dependence of the alignment effect is best seen\nin Fig. 12, when only the pZcm test and those quasars along the\nA1\u2013A3 axis (as defined in Sect. 4) are considered. A comoving distance scale is used to emphasize the regular variation\nof the alignment effect with cosmological distance. This variation appears quasi-periodic, the distance between two extrema\nbeing \u223c 1.5 h\u22121 Gpc. Such a behavior may clearly constitute\nan important clue to the interpretation of the alignment effect\n(Sect. 7). Additional data at high redshift are needed to confirm\nit. Interestingly enough, a quasi-periodicity in quasar polarization vector alignments, if correctly understood, may potentially\nconstitute a new distance indicator.\n\n6.1.2. Rotation of the mean direction with redshift?\nResults presented in Sect. 3 & 4 also indicate that the mean\npolarization angle of quasars changes with redshift. In Fig. 13\nwe plot the polarization angles of the 355 quasars, slightly averaged over redshift bins, as a function of the redshift. To emphasize possible relationships, each data point is plotted three\ntimes in the graph, adding n \u00d7 180\u25e6 to the polarization angles,\nwith n = 0, 1, 2. It appears quite clearly that the polarization\nangles are not randomly distributed over redshifts. Some patterns may be seen as, for example, a continuous decrease of the\npolarization angle with increasing redshift. The possible relation is more ambiguous around the redshifts z \u2243 0.7 towards\nthe SGP and z \u2243 1.2 towards the NGP, which correspond to\nthe redshift ranges where no alignment is detected (Fig. 11).\nAnother possible relation could be a decrease of the polarization angle with z in the SGP region (z < 0) followed by an\nincrease in the NGP region (z > 0).\n\n\fHutsem\u00e9kers D. et al.: Mapping extreme-scale alignments of quasar polarization vectors\n\n11\n\nTable 3. Results of correlation tests\nSample\n\nFig. 13. The quasar polarization angles as a function of the redshift. Redshifts are counted positively for objects located in the\nNorth Galactic Cap and negatively for those ones in the South\nGalactic Cap. Polarization angles are vectorially averaged over\nredshift bins \u2206z = 0.05. The full sample of 355 quasars is used.\nTo facilitate detection of patterns, each data point (z, \u03b8) is replicated at (z, \u03b8+180\u25e6 ) and (z, \u03b8+360\u25e6 ).\nTo investigate more quantitatively possible correlations, we\nmake use of statistical methods which take into account the circular nature of the data; they are described in Fisher (1993).\nFirst, we map the redshift onto the circle using \u03c6 = 2 tan\u22121 z,\nwhere z is taken to be negative for objects located in the South\nGalactic Cap and positive for those ones in the North Galactic\nCap. As usual, we take into account the axial nature of the polarization angles \u03b8 by multiplying them by a factor 2. Then\nwe analyse possible correlations between \u03c6 and \u03b8 using the\nbn and b\nbn is a corangular\u2013angular correlation coefficients \u03a0\n\u03c1T . \u03a0\nrelation coefficient based on the circular ranks of the \u03c6i and\n\u03b8i . It assesses monotone association between \u03c6 and \u03b8. b\n\u03c1T estimates the linear association between \u03c6 and \u03b8 based on the\nsimple models \u03c6 = \u03b8 + cst or \u03c6 = \u2212\u03b8 + cst. Because it is independent of the scaling of z (including its tranformation into\nbn correlation coefficient\na more physical distance scale), the \u03a0\nis more general. The hypothesis that \u03c6 and \u03b8 are independent is\nbn or b\nrejected if \u03a0\n\u03c1T differ too much from zero. The probability\nthat a value more different from zero than the observed values\nbn and b\nof \u03a0\n\u03c1T would occur by chance among uncorrelated \u03c6 and\n\u03b8 is evaluated on the basis of 105 permutations, shuffling the\npolarization angles over the redshifts.\nThe results of the statistical analysis are given in Table 3.\nThe full sample of 355 quasars is considered as well as the\nsample of 183 objects along the A1\u2013A3 axis. Out of these 183\nquasars, a sub-sample of 129 objects with p \u2264 2% is also considered. Looking at Fig. 13, we have noticed that polarization\nangles either continuously decrease with increasing redshift, or\ndecrease in the SGP region (z < 0) and increase in the NGP\none (z > 0). Both possibilities are tested by using the polarization angles \"as measured\" in both the SGP and NGP regions\n(case S1), or by taking 180\u25e6 \u2212 \u03b8 instead of \u03b8 for those objects\nlocated in the NGP region (case S2).

We then run the\ntests with the polarization angles expressed in both the equatorial (eq) and supergalactic (sg) coordinate systems. It essentially appears from Table 3 that the correlation between quasar\npolarization angles and redshifts is very significant, especially\nin the case S1 and when only those quasars of the A1\u2013A3 axis\nare considered. The correlation is significant in both coordinate systems. The tests were also carried out for the sample of\n172 quasars obtained when removing the objects which belong\nto the A1\u2013A3 regions. No correlation was found in that case,\nagain suggesting that the observed effect is mainly due to the\nobjects along the A1\u2013A3 axis.\nThe S1 correlation is illustrated in Fig. 14 for the 183\nquasars along the A1\u2013A3 axis. It shows a surprisingly clear\nquasi-linear relation (which is even better defined for the subsample of 129 quasars with p \u2264 2%, in agreement with the\nresults of Table 3). A simple linear regression over the 7 most\naccurate data points7 gives \u03b8\u0304 = (88\u25e6 \u00b1 6\u25e6 ) \u2212 (42\u25e6 \u00b1 4\u25e6 ) z. This\nrelation reproduces fairly well the preferred directions seen in\nFigs. 7 & 8. It corresponds to a rotation of roughly \u00b1 90\u25e6 over\nthe sampled redshift range. It is important to realize that, in\ngeneral, one may expect a step-like discontinuity at z = 0, and\nthen need a more complicated fitting of the S1 correlation. This\nis due to the way position angles are defined on the celestial\nsphere. Let us imagine a large-scale structure crossing the observer at z = 0 and for which we measure a position angle \u03b8\nlooking towards the NGP. For the same structure, we measure a\nposition angle \u2212\u03b8 looking towards the SGP, which makes a discontinuity in the position angles at z = 0 (unless \u03b8 \u2243 0\u25e6 or 90\u25e6\n7\n\nRegression may also be performed using the unbinned data set. In\nthis case the dispersion of the polarization angles is too large and a\ncircular analysis is mandatory. According to Fisher (1993), we may fit\nthe following model to the data: \u03b8\u0304 = \u03b8\u03040 + tan\u22121 \u03b2 z. The \u03b8i are assumed\nto be drawn from a von Mises distribution, with no dependence of\nthe dispersion upon redshift. The maximum likehood estimates of \u03b2\nand \u03b8\u03040 are \u22121.08 \u00b1 0.27 and 84\u25e6 \u00b1 6\u25e6 , respectively, for the [183-S1eq] sample. This confirms that the correlation between quasar mean\npolarization angles and redshifts is significant. The analysis with the\nwhole sample of 355 quasars gives similar results.\n\n\f12\n\nHutsem\u00e9kers D. et al.: Mapping extreme-scale alignments of quasar polarization vectors\n\nFig. 14. The quasar polarization angles, vectorially averaged\nover redshift bins \u2206z = 0.5, as a function of the redshift.\nRedshifts are counted positively for objects located in the\nNorth Galactic Cap and negatively for those ones in the South\nGalactic Cap. Only the 183 quasars belonging to the A1\u2013A3\naxis are considered here. Error bars represent 68% angular confidence intervals for the circular mean (Fisher 1993); they must\nbe seen with caution when the number of quasars per redshift\nbin is small, i.e. at large z. Errors are higher at z \u2243 \u22120.7 and\nz \u2243 1.2 in agreement with previous results. Data points are\nreplicated at (z, \u03b8), at (z, \u03b8+180\u25e6 ) and at (z, \u03b8+360\u25e6 ) as in\nFig. 13. The fitted line is given by \u03b8\u0304 = 268\u25e6 \u2212 42\u25e6 z (see text).\nin the adopted coordinate system). Furthermore, both the slope\nand the constant of the linear fit depend on the coordinate system. This problem can be partially overcome by parallel transporting the polarization vectors at a given location. More precisely, we may parallel transport the polarization vectors at the\nposition (\u03b1c , \u03b4c ) for those quasars located in the NGP region\nand (\u03b1c + 180\u25e6, \u2212\u03b4c ) for those ones in the SGP region. A reasonable choice is close to the A1\u2013A3 axis, say \u03b1c = 180\u25e6 and\nbn tests fully co\u03b4c = 10\u25e6 . In the S2 case, this makes the b\n\u03c1T and \u03a0\nordinate invariant, as well as the slope of the linear regression\nmodels. In the S1 case, the tests still depend on the coordinates\nthrough the discontinuity at z = 0. With parallel transport, there\nis a tendency for the S1 correlation to be slightly more significant than in Table 3, and for the S2 correlation to be slightly less\nsignificant. However, we find that the results of the statistical\ntests and regressions are essentially unchanged, provided that\none parallel transports the polarization vectors close to the A1\u2013\nA3 axis. Results are robust to small changes of (\u03b1c , \u03b4c ). Finally,\nthe rotation of the mean polarization angle is also clearly seen\nwhen using comoving distances instead of redshifts (Fig. 15).\nA linear regression gives \u03b8\u0304 = (88\u25e6 \u00b1 5\u25e6 ) \u2212 (31\u25e6 \u00b1 3\u25e6 ) r, where r\nis the comoving distance in h\u22121 Gpc.\nThe existence of a significant continuous rotation of the\nmean polarization angle as a function of the redshift 8 and the\nsymmetry of its dependence are clearly key properties of the\n8\nIn principle, the redshift dependence of the mean polarization angle may also be a colour effect rather than a distance effect because\nwe are sampling quasar rest-frame spectra at different wavelengths.\nHowever spectropolarimetry in the ultraviolet-visible range of (a few)\n\nFig. 15.

While the regions of alignments may look at\nfirst glance quite isolated, their properties appear connected on\nlarge cosmological distances. The fact that a rotation \u2243 45\u25e6\noccurs roughly over the distance between two strong alignments (\u223c 1.5 h\u22121 Gpc, Fig.12) suggests that both phenomena\nare probably due to a single mechanism. The simple mirrorlike (S1) symmetry of the \u03b8\u0304 \u2013 z relation is remarkable: rotation\nis clockwise with increasing redshift in NGP hemisphere and\ncounter-clockwise in the SGP one. This relation is the best defined and the most significant, but a counter-clockwise rotation\nin both the South and North Galactic Caps (S2 symmetry) cannot be totally excluded, especially if we consider the statistical tests applied to the full sample (Table 3). Also, due to the\n180\u25e6 uncertainty, several other complicated or asymmetric solutions to the \u03b8\u0304 \u2013 z relation could be imagined. Measurements\nof quasar polarization angles at redshifts z \u2265 2.5 are needed to\nextend and confirm the mirror-like symmetry of the \u03b8\u0304 \u2013 z relation. Moreover, it would allow us to know if the full rotation\ncan exceed 90\u25e6 or whether the mean polarization angle oscillates between 0\u25e6 and 90\u25e6 . Finally, it is interesting to note that\nextrapolating the redshift dependence of the mean polarization\nangle at z \u2243 0 gives \u03b8\u0304 \u2243 90\u25e6 . While this would be an unpleasant coincidence in the equatorial coordinate system, this\nvalue corresponds to \u03b8\u0304S G \u2243 0\u25e6 in the supergalactic reference\nframe, which means that the polarization vectors of hypothetical quasars at z \u2243 0 should be aligned perpendicular to the\nsupergalactic plane. It is also worth to note that \u03b8\u0304 at z = 0 is\ndifferent from the mean directions of the interstellar polarization (Fig. 9).\nquasars along the A1\u2013A3 axis does not show significant rotation of\nthe continuum polarization angle with wavelength (Impey et al. 1995,\nOgle et al. 1999). In general, very few quasars show a rotation of the\npolarization angle with wavelength. For example, among the 28 polarized quasars studied by Ogle et al. (1999), only 3 display a rotation\nof the polarization angle, typically \u2206\u03b8 \u223c 20\u25e6 over the full ultravioletvisible spectral range.\n\n\fHutsem\u00e9kers D. et al.: Mapping extreme-scale alignments of quasar polarization vectors\n\nFig. 16.

Positions\nand polarization angles are projected in a coordinate system of\nnorthern pole [\u03b1 p = 0\u25e6 , \u03b4 p = 30\u25e6 ] and denoted by \"P\". The distribution of polarization angles is weakly coherently oriented\nwith PHP = 2 10\u22122 and a preferred direction of 37\u25e6 in that coordinate system.\n\n6.2. Is there an alignment axis?\nThe fact that the most significant regions of polarization vector\nalignments are roughly opposite on the sky suggests that they\nmay define an axis in the Universe. The possible coincidence\nof such an axis with other preferred directions in the sky may\nprovide important clues to the origin of the alignment effect.\nFor example, region A1 is in the direction of Virgo, the center of the Local Supercluster (see also Sect. 3.2), and the A1\u2013\nA3 axis is not far from the direction of the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) dipole (\u03b1 = 168\u25e6 , \u03b4 = \u22127\u25e6 ). Recent analyses of WMAP data indicate that several large-scale anisotropies\nin the CMB are possibly related to this direction (e.g. Tegmark\net al. 2003). These possible coincidences are discussed in details by Ralston and Jain (2004).\n\n13\n\nThe evidence for an alignment axis, also suggested from\nthe maps shown in Fig. 4, is best illustrated in Fig. 16 where\na dipole-like anisotropy is clearly seen in the distribution of\nthe \"most aligned\" quasars, as measured from local statistics9 .\nHowever, this distribution is definitely affected by observational biases. Indeed, in Paper I, we discovered polarization\nvector alignments for quasars located not far from the celestial equator (the so-called regions A1 and A3), and we subsequently put emphasis on these regions when gathering additional data. Moreover, quasars are often surveyed in equatorial fields which provide the bulk of targets for a southern\nhemisphere observatory. So, it is not unexpected that the highest quasar densities and the highest significances do appear in\nthese regions. The effect of such intrincate biases on the significance of the axis is difficult to estimate (and is clearly beyond the scope of this paper). However, since preferred axes\nin the CMB are independently suggested, based on homogeneous data samples and in agreement with the anisotropy seen\nin Fig. 16, the fact that polarization data are compatible with a\npossible alignment axis is worth to keep in mind.\nA related question is the following: are there really no polarization vector alignments out of the A1\u2013A3 axis? Although\nmeasurements are not very numerous, we have tried to identify possible alignments in the upper right quadrant in Fig. 16.\nSince these objects are close to the celestial north pole, alignments are blurred when polarization angles are measured in\nequatorial coordinates. We then consider quasar positions and\npolarization angles in a coordinate system of northern pole\n[\u03b1 p = 0\u25e6 , \u03b4 p = 30\u25e6 ]. A possible alignment is tentatively identified in Fig. 17; it may constitute a high declination extension to\nthe low-redshift alignment seen in Fig. 7. But, given that very\nfew objects have been measured in these regions (only 46 out\nof 355 quasars belong to the third of the sky opposite to the\nregions of highest significance seen in Fig. 16), it is difficult to\nconclude and the fact that significant polarization vector alignments do or do not exist far from the A1\u2013A3 axis is still to be\ndemonstrated.\n\n6.3. Relation to quasar intrinsic properties\nOptical polarization is known to be related to other quasar intrinsic properties like spectral type or morphology. In order\nto understand the alignment effect, it is important to know\nwhether these relations are still valid for those objects in the regions of alignments. A full answer would require a much larger\nsample and more information on the objects than available in\nthe literature. Some questions have nevertheless been adressed\nin Paper I and II and are summarized here.\nIn the high-redshift region of alignment A1, several types\nof quasars have been observed, namely radio-loud, radio-quiet,\nand BAL quasars. These distinctions are based on the spectral\ncharacteristics of the objects. First, it is important to note that\npolarization vector alignments are not restricted to one cate9\nRalston & Jain (2004) computed (lII = 266\u25e6 , bII = 61\u25e6 ) for the\naxis. From Fig. 4 we found (\u03b1 = 180\u25e6 , \u03b4 = 10\u25e6 ) which corresponds to\n(lII = 267\u25e6 , bII = 69\u25e6 ). In Galactic coordinates, the CMB dipole points\ntowards (lII = 264\u25e6 , bII = 48\u25e6 ).\n\n\f14\n\nHutsem\u00e9kers D. et al.: Mapping extreme-scale alignments of quasar polarization vectors\n\ngory of objects. In region A1, BAL, non-BAL and radio-loud\nquasars follow the same alignment, with the same preferred polarization angle. However, possible differences with other types\nof objects like BL Lac cannot be excluded. Also, it is important\nto remark that known polarization differences between spectroscopically defined quasar types are not washed out by the\nalignment effect. For example, the known difference in polarization degree between BAL and non-BAL quasars is still valid\nin region A1 as demonstrated in Paper II.\nFinally, it is interesting to recall that quasar radio polarizations are usually not correlated to optical polarizations, and that\nradio polarization vectors do not seem to show alignments as\nthe optical polarization vectors do (Paper I, Vall\u00e9e 2002).\n\n7. Possible interpretations\nPossible interpretations of the alignment effect have been discussed in Paper I and II, and more recently by several authors\n(Jain et al. 2002, 2004, Bezerra et al. 2003, Greyber 2003,\nRalston & Jain 2004). They are further discussed here in the\nlight of the new results.\nSince the alignments occur on extremely large scales and\nappear connected on a sizeable fraction of the known Universe,\none must seek for global mechanisms acting at cosmological scales. Possible mechanisms must take into account the\nfact that the bulk of the measured polarization is intrinsic\nto the quasars. They may be divided into two broad categories. First, the polarization angles may be closely associated to the morphology of the objects, and the quasar structural axes themselves are aligned on cosmological scales.\nAlternatively, the polarization angles may be randomly oriented at the source, and modified when the light propagates\nthroughout the Universe. Since both large-scale alignments and\nregular rotation of the mean orientation must be explained,\nmore than one mechanism may contribute.\nIf we admit that quasar structural axes are coherently oriented at such large scales, a global rotation of the Universe may\nbe invoked. It would transfer angular momentum to galaxies\nand quasars during their formation, and, to some extent, correlate their structural axes with the direction of the global rotation (Li 1998). In this case, one would expect the rotation axis\nto be roughly perpendicular to the A1\u2013A3 direction. While it\nis not excluded that complex effects like precession could be\nat the origin of the redshift dependence of the mean orientation, a global rotation would also induce a rotation of the polarization angles as a function of the distance to the source (e.g.\nObukhov 2000). The mirror-like symmetry of the \u03b8\u0304 \u2212 z relation\nillustrated in Figs. 14 and 15 would be accounted for by a rotation axis close to the A1\u2013A3 axis, which is different from the\ndirection needed to produce the alignments. An intermediate\nposition would then be required to explain both effects. From\nFig. 15, we derive a universal angular velocity \u03c90 & (\u03c0/2) H0\nwhere H0 is the Hubble constant, in line with other estimates\n(K\u00fchne 1997, Obukhov 2000). As a consequence of an inclined\naxis, alignments should also be observed out of the A1\u2013A3 regions. Furthermore, the rotation of the polarization angle along\nthe line of sight would affect correlations between quasar polarization and structural position angles, at least in some red-\n\nshift ranges. Interestingly enough, rotating cosmologies have\nbeen recently proposed to explain possible anomalies in the\nCMB (Jaffe et al. 2005). Another possible mechanism for aligning morphological axes could be the effect of magnetic fields\ncoherent over very large scales (Reinhardt 1971, Wasserman\n1978, Battaner & Lesch 2000). Cosmological magnetic fields\ncould make the expansion of the Universe anisotropic (Berera\net al. 2004) and then be at the origin of a rotation of the polarization angles (Brans 1975). If polarization vector alignments\nactually reflect structural alignments, it is nevertheless difficult\nto explain the alternance of coherently and randomly oriented\npolarization vectors observed in Fig. 12.\nThe other possibility is that both the polarization vector\nalignments and the rotation of the mean polarization angles are\ndue to a mechanism which affects the light on its travel towards\nthe observer. As shown in Paper II, a small amount of polarization added to randomly oriented polarization vectors can be\nat the origin of coherent orientations of polarization angles10\nwithout scrambling too much the relation between polarization\nand other quasar intrinsic properties. Remarkably, a systematic\npolarization and a rotation of the polarization angle are predicted by photon\u2013pseudoscalar mixing within a magnetic field,\nincluding a quasi-periodic variation of the polarization along\nthe line of sight (e.g. Harari & Sikivie 1992, Gnedin 1994, Das\net al. 2005). Such an oscillation of the polarization added to the\nquasar intrinsic polarization vectors would appear as a quasiperiodicity in the alignment effect with redshift, in agreement\nwith the results of Sect. 6.1.1. Moreover, an associated rotation\nof the polarization angles may be expected, as demonstrated\nby recent simulations (Das et al. 2005). Apparently, photon\u2013\npseudoscalar mixing has the capability to explain most of the\ncharacteristics of the alignment effect, with a coupling constant\nand a magnetic field strength in agreement with current upper\nlimits. It must be emphasized that this mechanism requires the\nexistence of a \u2013hypothetical\u2013 magnetic field organized on cosmological scales. The symmetry of the \u03b8\u0304 \u2212 z relation (Figs. 14\nand 15) would then correspond to the symmetry of the magnetic field. Let us finally note that dust grains aligned in a\nmagnetic field can also produce some polarization, but would\nhardly explain quasi-periodic alignments and a rotation of the\nmean polarization angle.\nAlthough still hypothetical, photon\u2013pseudoscalar mixing\nwithin a magnetic field appears as a promising interpretation, especially because many of the observed characteristics\nof the alignment effect were predicted, at least qualitatively.\n10\n\nIn fact, if we had in mind to detect the effect of a small systematic\npolarization, the study of polarization vector alignments is probably\none of the most sensitive methods. Indeed, since extragalactic objects\nare usually intrinsically polarized at various levels (Fig. 2), the addition of a small systematic polarization would be largely undetected,\nsince it only slightly broadens the distribution of the polarization degrees. To some extent, this is also true for low polarization objects\n(e.g. radio-quiet quasars) because of the errors on the measurements\nand the subsequent confusion with the polarization degree bias (errors\nwere not taken into account in the simulations of Paper II). On the\nother hand, a systematic polarization of a few tens of a percent superimposed over randomly oriented polarization vectors do produce a\ndetectable effect in the distribution of the polarization angles.\n\n\fHutsem\u00e9kers D. et al.: Mapping extreme-scale alignments of quasar polarization vectors\n\nPseudoscalars may be related to dark matter or dark energy, or\nbe ejected by the quasars themselves along with photons (Jain\net al. 2002). However, other mechanisms like a global rotation of the Universe cannot be rejected, and should be worked\nout in more details to see whether or not they can reproduce\nthe observations and constitute viable explanations. In addition to a better spatial sampling namely at higher redshifts,\nthe determination of a possible wavelength dependence of the\npolarization, the behavior of circular polarization, the relation\nwith quasar morphological axes \u2013especially along the A1\u2013A3\naxis\u2013 would definitely shed light on the responsible mechanism(s) and more particularly on the photon\u2013pseudoscalar mixing for which rather clear predictions exist (Jain et al. 2002,\nDas et al. 2005). Observations can also be readily performed\nto demonstrate the existence of a possible preferred alignment axis, and its relation to other tentative anisotropies in the\nUniverse suggested either from the CMB data or from other\npossible large-scale effects like the \u2013still controversial\u2013 Birch\neffect (Birch 1982, Jain & Ralston 1999).\n\n8. Conclusions\nBased on new observations carried out during the period 2000 \u2013\n2003, we have constructed a new sample of quasar polarization\nmeasurements in order to further investigate the extreme-scale\nalignments of quasar polarization vectors discovered in Paper I.\nThe new sample contains 355 polarized quasars, i.e. more than\ntwo times the initial sample of 170 objects. Our goal was to\nfirmly reassess the significance of the alignment effect and to\nempirically derive constraints on possible interpretations.\nUsing various, complementary, statistical methods, we\ndemonstrate that quasar polarization angles are definitely not\nrandomly oriented over the sky. Polarization vectors appear coherently oriented over very large spatial scales, in regions located at both low and high redshifts and characterized by different preferred directions. These properties make the alignment\neffect difficult to explain in terms of local mechanisms, like a\ncontamination by interstellar polarization in our Galaxy.\nNext, we tried to empirically characterize the effect and\nmore particularly its dependence on redshift. We found a regular alternance of regions of coherently and randomly oriented polarization vectors along the line of sight. We also\nshowed that the mean polarization angle is significantly correlated to redshift, rotating clockwise with increasing redshift in\nNorth Galactic hemisphere and counter-clockwise in the South\nGalactic one. Interestingly enough, the alignment effect seems\nto be prominent along an axis not far from preferred directions\ntentatively identified in Cosmic Microwave Background maps.\nThe fact that polarization vector alignments do occur on\nextremely large scales and seem connected on a sizeable fraction of the known Universe points towards a global mechanism acting at the scale of the Universe. While several mechanisms like global rotation may, at least partially, explain the\nalignment effect, we note that the observed behavior remarkly\ncorresponds to the dichroism and birefringence predicted by\nphoton-pseudoscalar oscillation within a magnetic field, suggesting that we might have found a signature of either dark\nmatter or dark energy.\n\n15\n\nSuch interpretations would have profound implications on\nour understanding of the Universe and then certainly deserve\nfurther studies. Fortunately, simple observations, although time\nconsuming, would readily allow to distinguish between possible interpretations, the alignment effect then providing us with\na new tool to probe the Universe and its dark components.\nReferences\nBattaner, E., Lesch, H. 2000, Anales de F\u0131\u0301sica, 95, 213\nBerdyugin, A., Piirola, V., Teerikorpi, P. 2004, A&A, 424, 873\nBerera, A., Buniy, R.V., Kephart, T.W. 2004, JCAP, 10, 16\nBerriman, G., Schmidt, G.D., West, S.C., Stockman, H.S. 1990, ApJS,\n74, 869\nBezerra, V.B., Mosquera Cuesta, H.J., Ferreira, C.N. 2003, Phys.
