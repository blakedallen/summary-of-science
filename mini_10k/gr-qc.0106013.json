Spacetime splittings play an important role in\nmany aspects of gravitational theory, not only in helping interpret 4-dimensional\ngeometry in terms of our more familiar space-plus-time perspective, but also in\nmathematical analysis of various problems of the theory. Although there are many\nvariations on the idea of reintroducing space and time, all share a common foundation of introducing a family of test observers in spacetime who measure spacetime\n\u2217\n\nPresent Address: Physics Department, Amherst College, Amherst, MA 01002, USA.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nD. Bini, P. Carini and R.T. Jantzen\n\nquantities mathematically by the orthogonal decomposition of the tangent spaces\nto the spacetime manifold into their local rest spaces and local time directions.1, 2\nSuch a construction leads to a \"reference frame\" or \"reference system\" or other\nvariations of this terminology whose effect in general is to contribute inertial forces\nto the spatial force equation due to the motion of the family of test observers.\nAlthough one can agree on these concepts in simple nonrelativistic situations, the\nrichness of general relativity and of the geometry of spacetime allows many variations of their possible generalizations to the latter theory. There is not necessarily\na single \"correct\" generalization of any given concept, but simply different ways of\nmeasuring different quantities, some of which may be more useful than others.\nBecause of the equivalence principle, inertial forces have always entrigued people\nin connection with gravitational theory. Indeed the concept of centrifugal force is\nuseful in nonrelativistic mechanics, and in recent years Abramowicz et al3\u20139 have\nshown that a certain generalization of this concept can give a nice physical interpretation to certain properties of strong static gravitational fields in general relativity,\nalthough attempts to extend it first to stationary and then to arbitrary spacetimes\nhave been somewhat problematic.10\u201317 Here we place that work and related studies\nof de Felice and others18\u201324 in the more general context of gravitoelectromagnetism,\nthe framework which encompasses all the various splitting approaches to general relativity and provides a clean description of the possible choices of curved spacetime\ngeneralizations of centripetal acceleration and centrifugal and Coriolis forces. This\nis done not to exaggerate the importance of splitting spacetime but to help clarify\nthe link between our three-dimensional world view and nonrelativistic common experience on the one hand and the interpretation of concepts related to rotation and\nacceleration in general relativity on the other.\n2.\n\nThe nonrelativistic background\n\nBefore exploring the spacetime picture, it is worth recalling the classic example\nfrom nonrelativistic mechanics of a rigidly rotating Cartesian coordinate system and\nits relation to the ideas of centrifugal force and centripetal acceleration. It is here\nthat all our intuition for these concepts has its roots.\nLet xi = Ri j (t)x\u0304j be the coordinate transformation between \"space-fixed\" orthonormal coordinates {x\u0304i } and rotating \"body-fixed\" such coordinates {xi } with\na common origin in Euclidean space, borrowing from the usual terminology of the\nrigid body problem in classical mechanics. The body-fixed components of the angular velocity of the rotating system are defined by\n\u1e58i k R\u22121k j = \u03b4 ik \u01ebkjm \u03a9m .\n\n(2.1)\n\nBoth these and the space-fixed components \u03a9\u0304i = R\u22121i j \u03a9j are constant in the case\nof a rotation about a fixed axis with constant angular velocity about that axis.\nIf one evaluates the first and second time derivatives of the coordinates of a\ntrajectory, one easily finds\nx\u0304 \u0307 i\n\n= R\u22121i j [V j + \u1e8bj ] ,\n\n\fIntrinsic Derivatives and Centrifugal Forces in General Relativity . . .\n\n \u0308i\nx\u0304\n\n= R\u22121i j [Aj + 2(\u03a9 \u00d7 \u1e8b)j + \u1e8dj ] ,\n\n3\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere V i = (\u03a9 \u00d7 x)i = \u03b4 ij \u01ebjkm \u03a9k xm is the relative velocity field of the body-fixed\npoints relative to the space-fixed points, and Ai = (\u03a9 \u00d7 (\u03a9 \u00d7 x))i + (\u03a9\u0307 \u00d7 x)i is the\nrelative acceleration field, both evaluated along the trajectory.\n \u0308i = F\u0304 i is the space-fixed force per unit mass equation of motion for a point\nIf x\u0304\nparticle of mass m moving under the influence of a force mF\u0304 i , then the acceleration\nrelation above may be rewritten in the form\n\u1e8di = F i + g i + (\u1e8b \u00d7 H)i ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nby moving the additional terms due to the time dependence of the transformation\nto the other side of the equation where they appear as \"inertial forces\" due to the\nmotion of the body-fixed points to which the coordinate system is attached. One\nhas a \"gravitoelectric-like\" force g i = \u2212Ai due to the acceleration of those points,\nand the remaining \"gravitomagnetic-like\" force, the Coriolis force, which is due\nto the changing orientation of the body-fixed axes, which in turn is a manifestation of the relative motion of the body-fixed points. The latter force involves a\n\"gravitomagnetic-like field\" H i = 2\u03a9i . The \"gravitoelectric-like\" force consists of\nthe centrifugal force directed away from the axis of rotation and an additional force\ndue to the changing angular velocity.\nIn the more familiar case of a time-independent angular velocity, these two\nnoninertial force fields admit a scalar and a vector potential respectively. The\nscalar potential is just half the square of the magnitude of the relative velocity field\n\u03a6 =\ngi\n\n=\n\n1\n\u03b4ij V i V j ,\n2\n\u2212\u03b4 ij gradj \u03a6 ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhile this field itself serves as the vector potential\nH i = (curl V )i .\n\n(2.5)\n\nSince each body-fixed point is undergoing circular motion at constant velocity, the\nrelative acceleration field is exactly the familiar centripetal acceleration associated\nwith this simple motion, so the centrifugal force is just the sign-reversal of this\ncentripetal acceleration. The Coriolis force can be interpreted as due to the local\nvorticity of the flow of the body-fixed points in space (half the curl of the velocity\nfield), which is equal to the global constant angular velocity vector \u03a9i .\n3.\n\nThe Spacetime Setting\n\nThe great simplication of this discussion compared to a corresponding one in\nterms of a geometric splitting of spacetime is the common Newtonian time used\nby both systems of spatial coordinates. In a spacetime discussion, one must also\ntake into account the change in the local time direction, which complicates matters,\n\n\f4\n\nD. Bini, P. Carini and R.T. Jantzen\n\nespecially the relationship between a sign-reversed centripetal acceleration and a\ncorresponding centrifugal force. One also must re-interpret the time derivative in a\nway which makes geometric sense, and there are a number of distinct ways of doing\nthis, depending on how changes in fields are measured along general world lines.\nConsider only the case of time-independent angular velocity. By adding the\nadditional time coordinate transformation\nt = t\u0304\n\n(3.1)\n\nto the original spatial coordinate transformation, one obtains a transformation from\ninertial coordinates {t\u0304, x\u0304i } in Minkowski spacetime to noninertial coordinates {t, xi }\nwhich may be interpreted using the spacetime geometry. The time lines of each such\ncoordinate system sharing the same time coordinate hypersurfaces in Minkowski\nspacetime may be interpreted as the world lines of a family of test observers (when\ntimelike), representing the trajectories of the space-fixed and body-fixed points.\nThe first set are inertial (zero acceleration) observers with zero relative velocity,\nwhose world lines are the orthogonal trajectories to the family of time hypersurfaces,\nwhile the second are noninertial (accelerated) observers in relative motion and not\nadmitting any orthogonal family of hypersurfaces. Both families of world lines are\nthe flow lines of Killing vector fields of Minkowski spacetime (therefore having zero\nexpansion tensor), the first with zero vorticity and the second with nonzero vorticity.\nIn this description, it is only the families of time lines and time hypersurfaces which play a central role, not the specific choice of spatial coordinates which\nparametrize the families of time lines. It is in fact useful to introduce new spatial\ncoordinates adapted to the orbits of the body-fixed points, and their corresponding\nrotating system, namely nonrotating and rotating cylindrical coordinates adapted\nto the axis of the rotation. For example, if one chooses the axis of rotation so that\n\u03a9\u0304i = \u03a9i = \u03a9\u03b4 i 3 , one can choose the usual cylindrical coordinates {\u03c1\u0304, \u03c6\u0304, z\u0304} in place of\n{x\u0304i }, and rotating cylindrical coordinates {\u03c1, \u03c6, z} which differ only by \u03c6 = \u03c6\u0304 \u2212 \u03a9t\u0304.\nHowever, a description in terms of quantities measured by each family of test observers involves their local proper times, which in the second case are not associated\nwith any global time function. Global time functions not directly measuring observer proper time occur in the context of \"observer-adapted\" coordinate systems.\nA system of coordinates can be adapted to the observer congruence in one of two\nways.1 For a general congruence with nonzero vorticity, the appropriate coordinates\nare comoving, leading to an approach called the threading point of view, while for\na vorticity-free congruence, one can use more general coordinates adapted to the\nfamily of orthogonal hypersurfaces admitted by the congruence, leading to an approach called the slicing point of view. In each case, the adapted local coordinates\n{t, xi } lead to the introduction of explicit potentials for the various gravitational\nforces.\nA slicing together with a transversal threading (congruence) describes exactly\nthe structure on which each of these two points of view is built, here called a\n\"nonlinear reference frame.\" In the flat Minkowski space example with inertial or\n\n\fIntrinsic Derivatives and Centrifugal Forces in General Relativity . . .\n\n5\n\nrotating observers, one has the geodesically parallel slicing orthogonal to the paths\nof the original inertial observers, together with the rotating observers which provide\na new threading of this slicing (when those observers are defined). Rotating Cartesian or cylindrical coordinates on Minkowski spacetime are examples of coordinates\nadapted to the nonlinear reference frame associated with this slicing and threading.\nIn the threading point of view the threading congruence serves both as the observer\ncongruence as well as the curves along which evolution is measured, while in the\nslicing point of view these two roles are separated: the orthogonal trajectories to\nthe slicing form the observer congruence, while the measured quantities are evolved\nalong the distinct threading congruence.\nThis is a nonlinear reference frame adapted to the stationary axisymmetry of the\nflat Minkowski spacetime. A similar geometrically privileged nonlinear reference\nframe exists in any stationary axisymmetric spacetime, in particular in the Kerr\nblack hole spacetimes (with the Schwarzschild black hole as their static limit) and\nin the G\u00f6del spacetime. For such spacetimes with some of the same symmetries\nwhich characterize the uniformly rotating observers in Minkowski spacetime, one\nmight hope to define generalized centrifugal and Coriolis forces, but without these\nsymmetries one must rethink the point of departure.\nThis is not the whole story about centrifugal force in classical mechanics, since it\nmakes its appearance in at least two other familiar contexts. As discussed in detail\nby Abramowicz,5 one is the train, plane, car context in which one has an accelerated platform to which a local reference frame is attached, essentially the previous\nproblem with additional motion of the origin of coordinates. Any point fixed in\nthis local platform will then experience accelerations tangential and transverse to\nits direction of motion, and the transverse acceleration can be interpreted in terms\nof a centrifugal force in the local reference frame due to its instantaneous rotation\nabout the center of the osculating circle associated with the curvature of its path. If\nthe point is in motion with respect to the local platform, Coriolis effects are felt as\nwell, but the details are more complicated than the simpler rigid body discussion.\nA third context in which the centrifugal force is usually introduced is in the\ndiscussion of motion in a central potential.5 Here one introduces a polar coordinate\nsystem in the plane of the motion and then expresses the equation of motion in\nthat coordinate system. The radial component of this equation for general motion\nthen contains what is interpreted as a centrifugal force term due to the curvature\nof the circular angular coordinate lines. This term is just the sign-reversal of the\ncentripetal acceleration for motion confined to these coordinate lines and enters the\nequation of motion through a Christoffel symbol term associated with this curvature, quadratic in the angular speed. Although there is no rotating frame in this\ndiscussion, one may be introduced by letting the new system rotate about the center of force so that the particle in motion has a fixed new angular coordinate. In\nthis rotating frame, the same centrifugal force term is then realized as in the rigid\nbody discussion as a rotating frame effect, but rotating about the center of force,\nnot the instantaneous radial direction associated with the curvature of the particle\n\n\f6\n\nD. Bini, P. Carini and R.T. Jantzen\n\npath. For circular motion, this centrifugal force is just the sign-reversal of the centripetal acceleration of the particle path, but for general noncircular motion, the\ntwo quantities are not simply linked.\nIn other words, the \"fictitious\" centrifugal force is a convenience that only has\nmeaning with respect to some implied reference frame, and in the same problem can\nplay different roles depending on which frame is chosen. For circular trajectories,\nall of these various aspects of centrifugal force come together, presenting the most\nuseful application of the concept.\nIn general relativity the best hope of having a useful generalization of centrifugal\nforce lies in the static axisymmetric case with circular trajectories. Consideration\nof noncircular trajectories in that case or relaxing the symmetry even to stationarity already introduces difficulties which make the whole discussion rather unclear.\nHowever, the idea of a relative centripetal acceleration viewed by an observer, being\nwell defined in a single reference frame, sidesteps the questions involving two different reference frames that seem to be tied up with various aspects of centrifugal\nforce and it is therefore reasonable to generalize it to an arbitrary spacetime.\nThe key difference between the nonrelativistic description of inertial forces and\nthe framework of general relativity is that in the latter context, the effects of a\ngravitational field due to the presence of matter are intertwined with those of the\naccelerated motion of the field of observers used to establish a given reference frame\nin order to \"measure\" the gravitational forces. Only under special symmetry conditions does it seem to make sense to try to separate the two. Moreover, focusing\nattention on a single test particle world line without referring it to an independent\nfamily of test observers (which are not adapted to the particular worldline) reduces\nthe usefulness of a space-plus-time interpretation of the motion, except possibly in\nreference to the spacetime Frenet-Serret frame which is completely determined by\nthe world line alone.25\u201328\n4.\n\nA family of test observers\n\nA splitting of a general spacetime equipped with a Lorentzian metric g\u03b1\u03b2 (signature -+++) and the covariant derivative \u2207\u03b1 associated with its symmetric connection\nis accomplished locally by specifying a future-pointing unit timelike vector field u\u03b1\n(u\u03b1 u\u03b1 = \u22121). This field may be interpreted as the four-velocity of a family of\ntest observers whose proper time parametrized world lines (let \u03c4u denote such a\nparameter on each world line) are integral curves of u\u03b1 .\nThe orthogonal decomposition of each tangent space into the local rest space\nand local time direction of the observer extends to all the tensor spaces above\nit and to the algebra of spacetime tensor fields, and may be referred to as the\nmeasurement process associated with the family of test observers. Tensors or tensor\nfields which have no component along u\u03b1 are called spatial (with respect to u\u03b1 ). The\nfully covariant and contravariant forms of the spatial projection tensor P (u)\u03b1 \u03b2 =\n\n\fIntrinsic Derivatives and Centrifugal Forces in General Relativity . . .\n\n7\n\n\u03b4 \u03b1 \u03b2 + u\u03b1 u\u03b2 are referred to as the corresponding forms of the spatial metric\nP (u)\u03b1\u03b2 = g\u03b1\u03b2 + u\u03b1 u\u03b2 .\n\n(4.1)\n\nSimilarly let \u03b7(u)\u03b1\u03b2\u03b4 = u\u03b4 \u03b7\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2\u03b4 be the spatial unit antisymmetric tensor associated\nwith the spatial metric, where \u03b70123 = 1 = \u03b7(u)123 in a time-oriented, oriented\northonormal frame having u\u03b1 as its first element. This tensor may be used to define\na spatial duality operation for antisymmetric spatial tensor fields in an obvious way.\nAs described in Ref. 1, one may also spatially project various derivative operators so that the result of the derivative of any tensor field is always spatial; such\nderivatives naturally occur in expressing tensor equations in space-plus-time form.\nTwo useful spatial derivatives are the spatial Lie derivative \u00a3(u)X = P (u)\u00a3X ,\nfor any spatial vector field X \u03b1 , and the spatial covariant derivative \u2207(u)\u03b1 =\nP (u)P (u)\u03b2 \u03b1 \u2207\u03b2 , where the projection on all free indices is implied after the application of the derivative. Similarly three useful temporal derivatives are the\ntemporal Lie derivative \u2207(lie) (u) = P (u)\u00a3u , the Fermi-Walker temporal derivative \u2207(fw) (u) = P (u)u\u03b1 \u2207\u03b1 , and the corotating Fermi-Walker temporal derivative\n\u2207(cfw) (u) related to the first two by the kinematical fields (acceleration a(u)\u03b1 , vorticity \u03c9(u)\u03b1 \u03b2 , expansion \u03b8(u)\u03b1 \u03b2 ) of the observer congruence,\na(u)\u03b1\n\n=\n\n\u2207(fw) (u)u\u03b1 ,\n\n\u03c9(u)\u03b1\u03b2\n\n=\n\nP (u)\u03b3 \u03b1 P (u)\u03b4 \u03b2 \u2207(u)[\u03b3 u\u03b4] ,\n\n\u03b8(u)\u03b1\u03b2\n\n=\n\nP (u)\u03b3 \u03b1 P (u)\u03b4 \u03b2 \u2207(u)(\u03b3 u\u03b4)\n1\n1\n\u2207(lie) (u)g\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2207(lie) (u)P (u)\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n2\n2\n\n=\n\n(4.2)\n\nthrough the relations\n\u2207(cfw) (u)X \u03b1 = \u2207(fw) (u)X \u03b1 + \u03c9(u)\u03b1 \u03b2 X \u03b2 = \u2207(lie) (u)X \u03b1 + \u03b8(u)\u03b1 \u03b2 X \u03b2\n\n(4.3)\n\nvalid only for a spatial vector field X \u03b1 , but easily extended to any spatial tensor field\nin the usual way. It is also convenient to use extend the notation \u00a3(u)X = P (u)\u00a3X\nto any vector field X \u03b1 , spatial or not. All indices are spatially projected when these\nspatial differential operators are applied to a tensor field. The geometrical meaning\nof these derivatives is discussed in Ref. 1. For spatial fields, the Fermi-Walker\ntemporal derivative coincides with the spacetime Fermi-Walker derivative along the\nobserver congruence, explaining the terminology.\nNote that the spatial covariant derivative and the ordinary and corotating FermiWalker temporal derivatives of the spatial metric are all zero, so index-shifting of\nspatial fields commutes with these derivatives. The Lie temporal derivative of the\nspatial metric instead equals twice the expansion tensor of the observer congruence,\nso index shifting of a spatial tensor being differentiated by this operator leads to\nadditional terms involving this tensor.\nIt is useful to introduce a vorticity or rotation vector field using the spatial\nduality operation\n(4.4)\n\u03c9(u)\u03b1 = 21 \u03b7(u)\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u03c9(u)\u03b2\u03b3 .\n\n\f8\n\nD.

The usual\nsloppy notation of this equation which does not distinguish between the original\nand the extended tensor field nor indicate its validity only on the curve itself must\nalways be understood in this context.\nFor a vector defined only along the curve, this leads to the usual formula in\nterms of the ordinary parameter derivative of the components along the world line\nplus the connection coefficient correctional terms\nDX \u03b1 /d\u03bb = dX \u03b1 /d\u03bb + \u0393\u03b1 \u03b2\u03b3 V (\u03bb)\u03b2 X \u03b3 .\n\n(5.2)\n\nIn a previous article1 this derivative has been referred to as the total covariant\nderivative along V (\u03bb)\u03b1 or along the parametrized curve.\nIf one performs an orthogonal projection of the intrinsic derivative along such a\nparametrized curve in the measurement process associated with the family of test\nobservers, one is led to a new derivative operator along that curve which is natural to\ncall either the Fermi-Walker spatial intrinsic derivative or the Fermi-Walker total\nspatial covariant derivative. For example, if X \u03b1 is any vector defined along the\ncurve, this derivative is defined by\nD(fw) (V (\u03bb), u)X \u03b1 /d\u03bb = P (u)\u03b1 \u03b2 DX \u03b2 /d\u03bb .\n\n(5.3)\n\nIf one extends X \u03b1 to a smooth vector field off the curve, then for this extended\nvector field, expressing this derivative in terms of the measurement of the tangent\nvector itself\nV (\u03bb)\u03b1 = V (\u03bb)(||u ) u\u03b1 + [P (u)V (\u03bb)]\u03b1\n(5.4)\n\n\fIntrinsic Derivatives and Centrifugal Forces in General Relativity . . .\n\n9\n\nleads to the natural pairing of its temporal part V (\u03bb)(||u ) = \u2212u\u03b3 V (\u03bb)\u03b3 and spatial part [P (u)V (\u03bb)]\u03b1 = P (u)\u03b1 \u03b3 V (\u03bb)\u03b3 with the corresponding projections of the\ncovariant derivative acting on the smooth extension\nD(fw) (V (\u03bb), u)X \u03b1 /d\u03bb = {V (\u03bb)(||u ) \u2207(fw) (u) + [P (u)V (\u03bb)]\u03b2 \u2207(u)\u03b2 }X \u03b1 ,\n\n(5.5)\n\nwhere the individual terms on the right hand side depend on how the extension is\nmade. These individual terms have no meaning without such an extension, a fact\nwhich has caused some confusion in attempts to generalize centrifugal and other\nnoninertial forces to curved spacetimes.12\u201315\nBy replacing the Fermi-Walker temporal derivative in the expression for the\nFermi-Walker intrinsic derivative acting on the extended tensor field with the Lie\ntemporal derivative or the corotating Fermi-Walker temporal derivative respectively,\none defines the corresponding total spatial covariant derivatives of a spatial vector\nfield\nD(tem) (V (\u03bb), u)X \u03b1 /d\u03bb = {V (\u03bb)(||u ) \u2207(tem) (u) + [P (u)V (\u03bb)]\u03b2 \u2207(u)\u03b2 }X \u03b1\ntem=fw, cfw, lie\n\n,\n\n(5.6)\n\nwhere again the righthand side expression only makes sense for an extended vector\nfield, but leads to well-defined derivatives for a spatial vector defined only on the\nparametrized curve.\nThese three derivatives of spatial vectors along the world line differ among themselves only by a linear transformation of the local rest space\nD(cfw) (V (\u03bb), u)X \u03b1 /d\u03bb =\n=\n\nD(fw) (V (\u03bb), u)X \u03b1 /d\u03bb + V (\u03bb)(||u ) \u03c9(u)\u03b1 \u03b2 X \u03b1\nD(lie) (V (\u03bb), u)X \u03b1 /d\u03bb + V (\u03bb)(||u ) \u03b8(u)\u03b1 \u03b2 X \u03b1 ,(5.7)\n\nexpressions which may be used together with Eq. (5.3) to define the corotating and\nLie such derivatives in terms of the Fermi-Walker one when acting on spatial fields.\nThe ordinary and corotating Fermi-Walker total spatial covariant derivatives of the\nspatial metric vanish so they commute with index shifting on spatial fields, and one\nmay introduce spatial orthonormal triads along the curve for which one of these\nderivatives vanishes. These are natural to call \"relative Fermi-Walker\" or \"relative\ncorotating Fermi-Walker\" propagated spatial frames along the parametrized curve.\nThe Lie such derivative of the spatial metric vanishes only if the expansion tensor\nvanishes, in which case it coincides with the corotating Fermi-Walker total spatial\ncovariant derivative. Thus in general the \"relative Lie\" propagated spatial frames\nalong the parametrized curve will not remain orthonormal if initially so when the\nexpansion tensor is nonzero.\nThe three different choices of derivative correspond to the three possible ways\nof evolving spatial frames into the future, the first two of which preserve inner\nproducts. They each measure differences with respect to the associated relative\npropagated spatial frames along the given curve. The relationship between the\nrelative Lie transport and the relative Fermi-Walker transport along the observer\n\n\f10\n\nD. Bini, P. Carini and R.T.

The solutions lead to valid reparametrizations as long as\nthe right hand side of the differential equation does not vanish, so that an invertible\nrelationship exists between the old and new parametrizations. When one of the\ntwo right hand sides vanishes identically, the parameter becomes a proper interval\nparameter (proper distance orthogonal to the observer family or proper time along\nit respectively).\nThe derivatives of these new parameters are in turn related to the derivatives of\nthe spacetime interval by the usual relation\n[ds/d\u03bb]2 = \u2212[d\u03c4(V (\u03bb),u) /d\u03bb]2 + [dl(V (\u03bb),u) /d\u03bb]2 ,\n\n(6.2)\n\nwhile their quotient up to sign defines the relative speed of the curve as seen by the\nobserver family\n\u00b1 \u03bd(V (\u03bb), u) = dl(V (\u03bb),u) /d\u03c4(V (\u03bb),u) = ||P (u)V (\u03bb)||/V (\u03bb)(||u ) .\n\n(6.3)\n\nThe relative velocity itself and (when nonzero) the unit vector defining its direction\nare themselves defined by\n\u03bd(V (\u03bb), u)\u03b1 = [P (u)V (\u03bb)]\u03b1 /V (\u03bb)(||u ) ,\n\n(6.4)\n\n\u03bd\u0302(V (\u03bb), u)\u03b1 = [P (u)V (\u03bb)]\u03b1 /||P (u)V (\u03bb)|| .\n\n(6.5)\n\nand\nThe total spatial covariant derivatives along the parametrized curve may be reexpressed in terms of the new parametrizations by the chain rule\nD/d\u03bb\u2032 = [d\u03bb/d\u03bb\u2032 ] D/d\u03bb = [d\u03bb\u2032 /d\u03bb]\u22121 D/d\u03bb ,\n\n(6.6)\n\nwhere D here stands for any of the intrinsic derivative operators and \u03bb\u2032 for either\nnew parametrization.\nSince the Fermi-Walker and corotating Fermi-Walker such derivatives respect\nspatial orthogonality, one may use them to introduce a relative spatial Frenet-Serret\nframe of each type along the parametrized curve, using the relative spatial arclength\nparametrization to generalize the usual objects on a Riemannian 3-manifold. The\n\n\fIntrinsic Derivatives and Centrifugal Forces in General Relativity . . .\n\n11\n\nspatial unit vector \u03bd\u0302(V (\u03bb), u)\u03b1 plays the role of the \"relative unit tangent,\" and\nthe direction and length of its derivative with respect to the relative spatial arclength yields the \"relative unit normal\" and \"relative spatial curvature\" of each\ntype, while the spatial cross-product of the relative unit tangent and normal defines\nthe \"relative unit bi-normal,\" whose derivative in turn leads to the \"relative torsion.\" For a stationary spacetime with test observers following the trajectories of\ntimelike Killing vector field, the relative Frenet-Serret structure for the corotating\ncase corresponds to the usual such structure on the observer quotient space with the\nprojected Riemannian metric, suggesting that it is a generalization worth considering. Such a relative spatial Frenet-Serret structure should be clearly distinguished\nfrom the spacetime Frenet-Serret structure for the curve.25\u201328\n7.\n\nMeasuring the intrinsic derivative along a test particle world line\n\nSuppose one considers the world line of a nonzero rest mass test particle in\nspacetime parametrized by the particle's proper time \u03c4U , letting U \u03b1 denote its unit\ntimelike tangent vector, the four-velocity of the test particle.

Suppose one considers a world line segment which starts and ends on a single\nobserver world line, and one transports a spatial vector along both paths (general\nworld line and observer world line) from the initial to the final point using the\ntransport associated with one of the three kinds of total spatial covariant derivatives. In each case the two final vectors will have distinct directions, and in the\nLie case, different magnitudes in general, due to curvature effects associated with\nthe spatial metric, similar to the case of two such paths in the simpler case of a\nfixed Riemannian three-manifold. For a timelike Killing vector field test observer\ncongruence in a stationary spacetime, where the Lie and corotating total spatial\ncovariant derivatives coincide, the corotating Fermi-Walker space curvature effect\nis exactly that due to the curvature of the natural projected Riemannian metric\non the quotient space of observer world lines. For circular orbits in a stationary\naxisymmetric spacetime, this effect may be calculated explicitly using the tangent\ncone to the embedding of the plane of the orbit, as discussed in appendix 1.A of\nArnold.33\nSince index shifting does not commute with the Lie total spatial covariant derivative, letting this derivative act instead on p(U, u)\u03b1 leads to an additional expansion\nterm in the Lie spatial gravitational force.

For a special case of a vorticity-free congruence where the\ngravitomagnetic vector field vanishes, it is more natural to refer to the partial\nsplitting as the hypersurface point of view, and for the full splitting one can use more\ngeneral coordinates adapted to the family of orthogonal hypersurfaces admitted by\nthe congruence (the time coordinate hypersurfaces), allowing the time coordinate\nlines to be determined by a second independent congruence. One then has the choice\nof representing all the hypersurface-forming observer-measured quantities directly\n(the hypersurface point of view) or of working in a hybrid two-congruence approach\ncalled the slicing point of view, in which the evolution is described in terms of the\nsecond congruence. This latter approach is the one well known from the work of\nArnowit, Deser, and Misner.34, 35 The gravitomagnetic vector field reappears in\nthis latter approach as a relative velocity effect introduced through the use of a\nnew temporal derivative along the time lines rather than along the observer world\nlines.36 Thus for a given spacelike slicing and timelike threading (together forming\na \"nonlinear reference frame\"), one obtains two distinct families of observers and\nthree distinct points of view which agree only when the slicing and threading are\northogonal.\nLet {x\u03b1 } = {t, xa } with x0 = t be a set of local coordinates (said to be \"adapted\nto the nonlinear reference frame\") for which the time coordinate hypersurfaces (constant t) belong to the given slicing of spacetime and the time coordinate lines (constant xa ) belong to the given threading congruence.

In all cases the spatial metric projects to a\nRiemannian metric on the threading quotient space where the relative motion takes\nplace and all calculations become much more straightforward. The scalar and vector potentials then become potentials in the usual sense on this space since spatial\nprojection is unnecessary and the curl and gradient are just the ones on this Riemannian observer quotient space. Furthermore the threading observer expansion\ntensor vanishes although the slicing observer one does not, leading to the coincidence of the Lie and corotating Fermi-Walker derivatives in the threading point of\nview. The temporal derivative observer-adapted frame structure functions in the\nthreading point of view therefore satisfy C(cfw) (m)a b = C(lie) (m)a b = 0, and the\ntwo associated total spatial covariant derivatives coincide as well. In the case of the\nslicing observer-adapted frame, one instead has\nC(n)(cfw) a b \u2212 \u03b8(n)a b = C(n)(lie) a b = N \u22121 \u2202N a /\u2202xb ,\n\n(12.24)\n\nbut for relative motion along a spatial Killing direction \u03bd(U, n)b \u2202N a /\u2202xb = 0, so\nthe shift derivative term does not contribute to the relative curvature and the centripetal acceleration in that case, making the Lie relative curvature the simplest\nsuch curvature in the hypersurface point of view. However, the expansion term\ndoes lead to an additional term in the corotating Fermi-Walker centripetal acceleration which is linear in the relative velocity; a similar linear term arises also in\nthe the slicing point of view expression due to the relative velocity of the observers\nthemselves relative to the threading.\n13.\n\nSpatial coordinate line curvature in stationary spacetimes with additional symmetry\n\nSuppose e0 \u03b1 is a timelike Killing vector field in a stationary spacetime with\nan additional spacelike Killing vector field for which t and x3 respectively are comoving coordinates, so that the metric only depends on the remaining two coordinates. Assume also that the spatial coordinates are orthogonal, a situation which\ndescribes many interesting stationary spacetimes, including rotating black holes\n(Kerr spacetimes) in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates and the G\u00f6del spacetime in the\nusual Cartesian-like or cylindrical-like coordinates.\nConsider a test particle worldline following a Killing trajectory in the 2-surface\nof the coordinates t and x3 with the remaining two coordinates fixed, implying that\nin either the associated threading or slicing point of view, the unit velocity vector\nhas a single nonvanishing constant spatial coordinate component.

In each of\nthese four formulas, the relative curvature of these special trajectories corresponds\nexactly to the coordinate line curvature in the quotient space Riemannian geometry\nor its optical version for the relevant observer point of view (threading, slicing, or\nhypersurface).

Since null geodesics are invariant under\nspacetime conformal transformations, one may re-express the spatial equation of\nmotion for a massless test particle in terms of the new line element, thus absorbing\nthe scalar potential part of the gravitoelectric force term into the spatial geometry\nitself (since the rescaled metric has a unit lapse). In the case of a static spacetime\nwith a nonlinear reference frame adapted to the threading congruence of a timelike\nKilling vector field, so that the shift field is zero and the adapted coordinates are\nGaussian normal with respect to the new geometry, the spacetime geodesics of the\nrescaled spacetime metric project down to geodesics of the observer quotient space\nwith the optical metric. Thus the geodesics of the optical spatial metric on this\nspace are the paths of light rays, and the optical geometry measures deviations\nfrom these paths. Of course timelike geodesics are not invariant under conformal\ntransformations, so the equations of motion of a massive test particle still contain\nan explicit gravitoelectric term when re-expressed in this way.\nThis idea, closely related to the general relativistic Fermat principle37 and older\ndiscussions of M\u00f8ller,38 is the origin of a long series of papers by Abramowicz and\ncoworkers. The key difficulty in understanding their calculations associated with\nthis idea lies in the obscure representation both of the intrinsic derivative along the\ntest particle world line and of the kinematical quantities of the observer congruence (which are not clearly identified) in terms of nongeometrical derivatives of a\nvector field on spacetime possessing the given world line as an integral curve. The\nvery special circumstances of circular orbits in their applications also give false impressions of the general case; in particular the various centripetal accelerations and\ngravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic forces there are all transverse to the direction\nof relative motion, and so reside in the intersection of the local rest spaces of the\nobservers and the test world line. The most recent formulation of this work14 is\nsimply the hypersurface point of view description of the decomposition of the spatial\nprojection of the 4-acceleration of the test world line.\nThe details of the spacetime conformal transformation are straightforward and\nare discussed in the appendix. The new spatial equation of motion in the threading\n\n\f28\n\nD. Bini, P. Carini and R.T.

For purely\ntransverse relative accelerated motion in which the spatial acceleration lies in the\ncommon rest subspace LRSU \u2229 LRSu (as in circular motion), then gamma times\nthe spatial acceleration is the 4-acceleration itself, which can therefore be expressed\nas the sum of the logarithmic gradient of the lapse plus gamma squared times an\n\"optical centripetal acceleration\"\n(\u22a5)\n \u0303\nu)\u03b1 /dl\u0303(U,u)\n\u00e3(tem) (U, u)\u03b1 = \u03bd\u0303(U, u)2 D\u0303(tem) (U, u)\u03bd\u0302(U,\n\n(15.9)\n\nplus additional terms due to the gravitomagnetic vector force and possible temporal\nderivatives.

Bini, P. Carini and R.T. Jantzen\n\nThe square of the gamma factor enters from the change of proper time between the\nobserver and test particle in the second derivative defining the acceleration.\nOne can also introduce the optical relative curvatures \u03ba\u0303(tem) (U, u) and\n \u0303\n\u03ba\u0303(lie) (U, n, e0 ) as the magnitude of the optical derivatives D\u0303(tem) (U, u)\u03bd\u0302(U,\nu)\u03b1 /dl\u0303(U,u)\n\u03b1\n \u0303\nand D\u0303(lie) (U, n, e0 )\u03bd\u0302(U, n) /dl\u0303(U,n) respectively, but all of these will only be relevant\nin the static case. This leads to the \"optically straight\" world lines which play a\nkey role in the \"reversal of the centrifugal force\" discussion of Abramowicz et al.\nNote finally that presence of the inverse square of the gamma factor multiplying\nthe logarithmic gradient of the lapse in the conformally rescaled force equations\nabove shows clearly that the ultrarelativistic limit for geodesic motion approaches\nthe free photon behavior in stationary spacetimes for which the Lie derivative term is\nzero. As the relative speed approaches 1 and the gamma factor becomes increasingly\nlarge, this term drops out and the observer arclength parametrization approaches\nthe proper time parametrization. One is then left with a balance of the optical\ncentripetal acceleration and the gravitomagnetic force as occurs for photons, as\nnoted by Abramowicz et al14 for the case of circular orbits in stationary axially\nsymmetric spacetimes.\nIn a long review,12 both the threading and hypersurface points of view were\nmentioned in the context of stationary axisymmetric spacetimes, and both points\nof view were applied to the Kerr spacetime in separate articles,10, 11 although the\nambiguity of the individual force terms in this approach was not addressed until the\ngauge-fixing discussion of a later version of the force decomposition.13 Although\nit is not easy to decipher (complicated by sign inconsistencies and minor errors),\nthe subsequent presentation of the Abramowicz et al definition of noninertial forces\nfor general spacetimes14 is just the hypersurface point of view decomposition (15.7)\nof the sign-reversed spatial projection of the test particle 4-acceleration expressed\nin terms of the Lie total spatial covariant derivative and the contravariant relative\nvelocity, with the gravitoelectric force and longitudinal and transverse relative accelerations shuffled among themselves by the conformal transformation. They refer to\nthe latter two as the Euler and centrifugal forces when sign-reversed and conformally\nshuffled. The gravitomagnetic tensor force is entirely due to the expansion tensor,\nwhich they refer to as the Coriolis force with its extra gamma factor, while their\ngravitational force is just the gravitoelectric vector field itself without the gamma\nfactor which occurs in the gravitoelectric force. The \"ACL gauge\" they have chosen for the extension of U \u03b1 off its worldline in the hypersurface point of view in\norder to make their derivative expressions meaningful is just \u2207(lie) (n)\u03bd\u0302(U, n)\u03b1 = 0\n(inconsistent with their covariant derivative formula for this derivative). One could\nalso repeat their discussion with the equally valid but distinct corresponding contravariant gauge condition \u2207(lie) (n)\u03bd\u0302(U, n)\u03b1 = 0, as well as switch to the threading\npoint of view as alluded to in an earlier article.12\nNone of their forces coincide with the relative forces measured by the observers,\nand in the case of more general motion in which the various forces (apart from the\nlongitudinal relative acceleration) are no longer all transverse, they do not lie in the\n\n\fIntrinsic Derivatives and Centrifugal Forces in General Relativity . . .\n\n31\n\nlocal rest space of the test world line, so their interpretation in terms of forces that\nwould be seen with respect to axes which comove with the test world line (apart\nfrom proper time adjustments) are no longer valid. This inconsistency appears in\nthe claim that the various forces they introduce lie in the \"comoving frame of the\nparticle\"13 when in fact they lie in the local rest space of the observer (the exception\nbeing the intersection of the two subspaces orthogonal to the relative 2-plane of the\nmotion).\nPerhaps one can best characterize the limitations of the approach and its development by saying that it was born in a very special context and then attempts\nwere made to generalize it, rather than realizing it as a specialization of an already\ngeneral approach for arbitrary spacetimes, the tools of which have been around for\na long time, but simply lacked a unifying umbrella. In particular, the key acceleration potential equation u\u03b2 \u2207\u03b2 u\u03b1 = \u00b1\u2207\u03b2 \u03a6 underlying this approach is inappropriate\nfor nonstationary spacetimes where an additional spatial projection is needed for\nthe gradient term and an additional Lie derivative of a vector potential is needed\nfor a threading point of view. However, this said, the original application to static\nspacetimes where the optical centripetal acceleration does reverse when the relative\nsigned optical curvature expression \u03ba\u0303(\u03c6, u)\u03c1\u0302 associated with the \u03c6 coordinate circles\nchanges sign is a very beautiful geometrization of the relative motion of massive\nand massless test particles, for which credit is clearly due for its recognition and\ndescription.\n\n16.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nBy implementing relatively straightforward ideas about special relativistic spaceplus-time splitting in the context of general relativity, using a notation which allows\none to examine all the possibilities for generalizing concepts which do not have\nunambiguous extensions into the more general arena, a foundation has been built\nwhich enables one to analyse any particular problem that involves the description of\nidealized observations in a given spacetime. Not only are such questions fascinating,\nbut their answers are often sufficiently subtle that much confusion has arisen even\nin the case of relatively simple spacetimes. Indeed the case of \"rigid rotation\" in\nflat spacetime itself still leads people astray in their attempts to come to terms with\nsuch questions.\nArmed with the present tools, one can examine the traditional test cases for\ninvestigating these ideas,39 namely Minkowski spacetime in rotating coordinates,\nthe black hole spacetimes of Kerr and Schwarzschild, and the spacetime which was\nthe first to dramatically challenge our intuition about rotation in general relativity\nnearly half a century ago, the G\u00f6del spacetime. This will be done in a companion\narticle, leading to a much clearer understanding not only of these spacetimes but\nof the tools themselves for studying other spacetimes.\n\n\f32\n\nD. Bini, P.

However, the \"antioptical\" gauge \u03c3 = M or \u03c3 = N respectively is\nimportant in certain analyses of the gravitational field equations themselves in the\ncase of stationary spacetimes and in post-Newtonian approximations.\nFrom their definitions, the spatial arclength parameter, the relative speed, and\nthe relative velocity unit vector must transform in the following way\ndl\u0303(U,u) /dl(U,u) = \u03c3 ,\n\u03bd\u0303(U, u) = dl\u0303(U, u)/d\u03c4(U,u) = \u03c3dl(U, u)/d\u03c4(U,u) = \u03c3\u03bd(U, u) ,\n \u0303\n\u03bd\u0302(U,\nu)\u03b1 = \u03c3 \u22121 \u03bd\u0302(U, u)\u03b1 ,\n\n(A.7)\n\nimplying that the relative velocity vector\n\u03bd\u0303(U, u)\u03b1 = \u03bd(U, u)\u03b1 = P (u)\u03b1 \u03b2 dx\u03b2 /d\u03c4(U,u)\n\n(A.8)\n\nis invariant.\nOne may also introduce the conformally rescaled energy and momentum (per\nunit mass)\n\u1ebc(U, u) =\n\n\u03c3 \u22121 E(U, u) = \u03c3 \u22121 \u03b3(U, u) ,\n\np\u0303(U, u) =\n\n\u03c3 \u22121 p(U, u) = \u03c3 \u22122 \u03b3(U, u)\u03bd\u0303(U, u) ,\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u22122\n\np\u0303(U, u)\n\n=\n\n\u03c3\n\np\u0303(U, u)\u03b1\n\n=\n\np(U, u)\u03b1\n\n(A.9)\n\n\u03b1\n\np(U, u)\n\nsatisfying\n\u1ebc(U, u)2 \u2212 p\u0303(U, u)2 = \u03c3 \u22122 .\n\n(A.10)\n\nThis choice for the conformal scaling of these last two quantities is made so that in\nthe special case of a Killing observer where u\u03b1 = M \u22121 \u03be \u03b1 , with \u03c3 \u22121 taken to be the\nmagnitude M of the Killing vector \u03be \u03b1 , then the conformally rescaled spatial metric\nis the optical spatial metric and the conformally rescaled energy is the conserved\nquantity \u1ebc(U, u) = \u2212p(U )\u03b1 \u03be\u03b1 which is constant along the test particle world line,\nwhile a Killing component of the covariant spatial momentum remains a conserved\nquantity if it is not rescaled.\nFinally, for a null geodesic where the equations of motion are conformally invariant, the new affine parameter can be defined by d\u03bb\u0303P /d\u03bbP = \u03c3 2 as in Eq. (D.6) of\nWald, leading to this same choice of conformal transformation for the momentum\n4-vector P \u03b1 = dx\u03b1 /d\u03bbP and its corresponding 1-form as for the spatial momentum\nand its 1-form in the case of a massive particle. This is easily seen from the action\n\n\f34\n\nD. Bini, P. Carini and R.T.

For example, for a\nspatial covector one has\nD\u0303(tem) (U, u)X\u03b2 /d\u03c4(U,u) = D(tem)(U, u)X\u03b2 /d\u03c4(U,u) \u2212 X\u03b3 C \u03b3 \u03b1\u03b2 \u03bd(U, u)\u03b1 .\n\n(A.13)\n\nOne can easily re-express the three-acceleration or rate of change of spatial\nmomentum in terms of this new derivative, using an immediate consequence of Eq.\n(A.12)\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n \u0303\nX \u03b1 \u2207(u)\n(A.14)\n\u03b1 X\u03b2 = X \u2207(u)\u03b1 X\u03b2 \u2212 X X\u03b1 \u2207(u)\u03b2 (ln \u03c3) .\nFor example, for a congruence of test particle world lines one would have\nD(tem) (U, u)p(U, u)\u03b2 /d\u03c4U\n\n=\n\nE(U, u)\u2207(tem)(u)p(U, u)\u03b2 + p(U, u)\u03b1 \u2207(u)\u03b1 p(U, u)\u03b2\n\n=\n\nD\u0303(tem)(U, u)p\u0303(U, u)\u03b2 /d\u03c4U + p(U, u)2 \u2207(u)\u03b2 (ln \u03c3) ,\n(A.15)\n\nwhere\nD\u0303(tem) (U, u)p\u0303(U, u)\u03b2 /d\u03c4U\n\n=\n\n \u0303\nE(U, u)\u2207(tem)(u)p(U, u)\u03b2 + p(U, u)\u03b1 \u2207(u)\n\u03b1 p(U, u)\u03b2\n\n=\n\nD(tem)(U, u)p(U, u)\u03b2 /d\u03c4U \u2212 p(U, u)2 \u2207(u)\u03b2 (ln \u03c3)\n(A.16)\n\ndefines the rescaled total spatial covariant derivatives for either a congruence of test\nparticle world lines or a single such world line respectively. Raising the index on\nthese equations introduces an extra term from the temporal derivative of the conformal factor. These formulas yield the results for the threading and hypersurface\npoints of view in the optical gauge for u = m, n, while replacing n by n, e0 in the\nappropriate places in the hypersurface Lie form of these equations yields the slicing\nversion.\nOne can similarly transform the derivative of the unit velocity vector needed to\nevaluate the relative centripetal acceleration, leading to the conformally rescaled\n\n\fIntrinsic Derivatives and Centrifugal Forces in General Relativity . . .\n\n35\n\nquantities corresponding to the relative curvature and radius of curvature and the\nrelative centripetal acceleration. If \u03bd\u0302(U, u)\u03b1 were actually a vector field on spacetime\nrather than being defined only along a single world line, one could decompose its\nspatially projected intrinsic derivative in the following way\nD(tem) (U, u)\u03bd\u0302(U, u)\u03b2 /dl(U,u)\n= [1/\u03bd(U, u)]D(tem)(U, u)\u03bd\u0302(U, u)\u03b2 /d\u03c4(U,u)\n= [1/\u03bd(U, u)][\u2207(tem)(u) + \u03bd(U, u)\u03bd\u0302(U, u)\u03b1 \u2207(u)\u03b1 ]\u03bd\u0302(U, u)\u03b2 .\n\n(A.17)\n\nNow re-express this in terms of the conformally rescaled quantities using the results\nof the first section of the appendix for the unit velocity vector to re-express the\n \u0303\nspatial covariant derivative in it in terms of a conformally rescaled derivative \u2207(u)\n\u03b1.\nOne finds\nD(tem) (U, u)\u03bd\u0302(U, u)\u03b2 /dl(U,u)\n \u0303\n= D\u0303(tem) (U, u)\u03bd\u0302(U,\nu)\u03b2 /dl\u0303(U,u)\n+Pu (U, u)(\u22a5) \u03b2 \u03b1 \u2207(u)\u03b1 ln \u03c3 \u2212 \u03bd\u0302(U, u)\u03b2 /\u03bd(U, u) \u2207(fw) (u) ln \u03c3 , (A.18)\nwhere the first of the following equalities\n \u0303\nD\u0303(tem) (U, u)\u03bd\u0302(U,\nu)\u03b2 /dl\u0303(U,u)\n \u0303\n \u0303\n \u0303\n= [1/\u03bd\u0303(U, u)][\u2207(tem) (u) + \u03bd\u0303(U, u)\u03bd\u0302(U,\nu)\u03b1 \u2207(u)\n\u03b1 ]\u03bd\u0302(U, u)\u03b2\n= D(tem) (U, u)\u03bd\u0302(U, u)\u03b2 /dl(U,u)\n\u2212Pu (U, u)(\u22a5)\u03b1 \u03b2 \u2207(u)\u03b1 ln \u03c3 + \u03bd\u0302(U, u)\u03b2 /\u03bd(U, u) \u2207(fw) (u) ln \u03c3 (A.19)\ndefines the equivalent action of the new derivative on a congruence of test particle\nworld lines, while the second defines it for a single such world line.\nThe magnitude of this conformal derivative of the conformal unit velocity defines the conformally rescaled relative curvature and its reciprocal the conformally\nrescaled radius of curvature, for the ordinary and corotating Fermi-Walker cases.\nMultiplying the last relationship by the conformal square of the velocity gives the\nconformally rescaled relative centripetal acceleration and its relationship to the original one as long as the total spatial covariant derivative is orthogonal to the relative\ndirection of motion\n(\u22a5)\n\n\u00e3(tem)(U, u)\u03b2\n\n(\u22a5)\n\n= \u03c3 2 [a(tem) (U, u)\u03b2 \u2212 \u03bd(U, u)2 Pu (U, u)(\u22a5)\u03b1 \u03b2 \u2207(u)\u03b1 ln \u03c3\n+\u03bd(U, u)\u03b2 \u2207(fw) (u) ln \u03c3] ,\n\ntem=fw, cfw\n\n.\n\n(A.20)\n\nNote that unless the observer temporal derivative of the conformal factor is zero,\nthe \"conformal derivative\" of the unit velocity is not orthogonal to the unit velocity\nitself, even if it is before the conformal rescaling.

For static circular orbits, the optical relative centripetal acceleration then becomes outward pointing when the transverse test particle 4-acceleration becomes larger in magnitude than the transverse test observer\n4-acceleration. This is the famous effect of the \"reversal of the centrifugal force\"\nmotivating the work of Abramowicz et al. The additional squared gamma factor\nin the relative centripetal acceleration compared to the optical relative centripetal\nacceleration prevents the reversal in the former case.\nReferences\n1. R.T.
