INTRODUCTION\n\nGravitational waves and black holes are among the most popular and intensively investigated topics in physics at\nthe turn of the millenium. Both are predictions of Einstein's General Relativity [1] which involve essentially relativistic\ngravitational effects. Gravitational waves were originally introduced by Einstein himself [2] and the first black-hole\nsolution was also almost immediately discovered [3], though the term black hole was coined much later [4]. In the\nremainder of the twentieth century, astrophysical evidence eventually accumulated to the point where it is nowadays\nbelieved that black holes are not only common in the universe, but astrophysically dominant energy sources and\nappreciable mass concentrations, being the final remnant of any sufficiently massive star, with supermassive black\nholes powering active galactic nuclei and lurking at the heart of most other galaxies, e.g. [5]. Gravitational waves are\nexpected to make a similar transition from theory to observation with the operation of several new gravitational-wave\ndetectors, e.g. [6]. Observation of gravitational waves from black holes would provide the first direct evidence for the\nexistence of the latter, rather than the impressive but indirect evidence of their effect on other astrophysical bodies\nor surrounding matter. The combination of these two intertwined topics, gravitational waves and black holes, poses\nan exceptional challenge for theorists.\nFor instance, an expected source of detectable gravitational waves is the inspiral and coalescence of a binary blackhole system. Although the earliest and latest stages are understood in terms of post-Newtonian [7] and close-limit\napproximations [8] respectively, the coalescence is generally thought to be tractable only by full numerical simulations\n[9,10]. Textbook theory simply does not suffice to understand the process in physical terms. Stationary black holes are\nwell understood [11\u201313], but the black holes of interest are highly dynamical. Asymptotic or weak gravitational waves\nare well understood, respectively by Bondi-Penrose theory [14\u201320] and Wheeler-Isaacson high-frequency (or merely\nlinearized) theory [21\u201326], but strong gravitational waves produced by a distorted, rapidly evolving black hole are not\nunderstood at all. Indeed, it is sometimes argued that there is nothing to physically understand, merely complicated\nequations to numerically integrate, as gravitational waves cannot be localized [25]. The main purpose of this article is\nto address this lack of relevant theory by providing an astrophysically realistic approximation scheme in which both\ngravitational radiation and black holes are locally defined, along with their physical attributes, with each dynamically\ninfluencing the other. The approximation can be simply stated: it holds where the gravitational wavefronts and black\n1\n\n\fhole (or other astrophysical object) are roughly spherical. This does not contradict the classically quadrupolar nature\nof gravitational waves, as the wave amplitude at different angles may be arbitrarily aspherical. The wavefronts, not\nthe waves themselves, should be roughly spherical.\nWith such a general premise of rough sphericity, this quasi-spherical approximation scheme intuitively promises a\nwide range of validity, in particular including a just-coalesced black hole. It may also prove applicable to neutron\nstars or supernovas, or indeed any astrophysical situation which has rough spherical symmetry. Further, for any other\nprocess which can be enclosed by roughly spherical surfaces, it provides a mid-zone and, assuming isolation, far-zone\napproximation. Mathematically this was originally achieved [27] by linearizing certain fields which would vanish in\nexact spherical symmetry, having made a decomposition of space-time adapted to the roughly spherical surfaces,\nhenceforth called transverse surfaces. This will henceforth be called the first quasi-spherical approximation. Since\nthere is no assumption of closeness to stationarity, the approximation holds for arbitrarily fast dynamical processes.\nThe approximation has also been tested against the main expected source of asphericity, angular momentum, by\napplying it to Kerr black holes [28]: the error in the strain waveform is much lower than expected signals from binary\nblack-hole coalescence.\nThe approximation allows a local definition of gravitational radiation essentially because the decomposed fields\nnaturally divide into quasi-spherical variables and wave variables, the latter satisfying a wave equation and yielding\nthe Bondi news, or equivalently, the observable strain. Specifically, the gravitational radiation is encoded in the shear\ntensors of the outgoing and ingoing wavefronts. Then by retaining non-linear terms in these (previously linearized)\nfields, one would expect to obtain an approximation which is more accurate for the gravitational-radiation sector.\nThis second quasi-spherical approximation is also presented here. Both first and second approximations share the\nremarkable feature that, to compute the observable waveforms, no transverse derivatives need be considered. The\ntruncated equations form an effectively two-dimensional system, already written in characteristic form by virtue of the\nfirst-order dual-null formulation, to be integrated independently at each angle of the sphere. Numerically this is much\neasier to implement and computationally inexpensive when compared to the full Einstein system. Numerical codes\nexist for both first and second approximations [28]. Moreover, the wave equation can be written as an Ernst equation in\nterms of a gravitational-radiation potential. Thus the gravitational-wave dynamics is amenable to analytical methods.\nThe first approximation describes gravitational-wave propagation on a background, though the background is neither\nnecessarily spherical nor fixed in advance; this merely means that the quasi-spherical equations decouple from the\ngravitational-wave equation. There is no such decoupling in the second approximation, and therefore no background\nwhich is independent of the waves. Back-reaction of the waves on the geometry is thereby included. Specifically, one\nmay define a gravitational-radiation energy tensor [29] which acts just like a matter energy tensor in the truncated\nEinstein equations. Thus there is a fully relativistic inclusion of gravitational radiation reaction for dynamic black\nholes. For instance, if a black hole emits gravitational radiation, it backscatters to produce ingoing radiation which is\nabsorbed by the black hole, thereby increasing its mass and area. This last property follows from a local second law\n[30,31], part of a general theory of black-hole dynamics [32], where a black hole is defined by a type of trapping horizon.\nThis local theory of dynamic black holes, not to be confused with textbook black-hole statics and asymptotics, is\nextended here by deriving quasi-spherical generalizations of the spherically symmetric first [33] and zeroth [32] laws\nof black-hole dynamics, involving local definitions of mass and surface gravity.\nThe article is organized as follows. \u00a7II reviews the formalism of dual-null dynamics, which provides a geometrical\ndescription of the wavefronts and the corresponding decomposition of Einstein gravity. \u00a7III describes both first and\nsecond quasi-spherical approximations and the resulting truncated field equations. \u00a7IV locally defines the gravitational\nradiation and its energy tensor \u0398. A truncated Einstein tensor illustrates the role of \u0398 as an effective matter energy\ntensor in the second approximation. \u00a7V locally defines dynamic black holes, along with mass m and surface gravity \u03ba.\n\u00a7VI derives an energy conservation law for the combined energy-momentum of the matter and gravitational radiation.\nThis is also formulated as a first law relating the gradient of m to work and energy-supply terms, including the\nenergy flux of the gravitational radiation. \u00a7VII gives zeroth, first and second laws of black-hole dynamics and various\ninequalities. \u00a7VIII introduces the complex gravitational-radiation potential, in terms of which \u0398 takes a scalar-field\nform and the gravitational-wave equation takes an Ernst form. \u00a7IX defines conformally rescaled fields more suited to\nasymptotics, including a localized Bondi flux and a conformal strain tensor. \u00a7X concludes.\nII. DUAL-NULL DYNAMICS\n\nThe wavefronts of outgoing and ingoing gravitational radiation form two families of null hypersurfaces, intersecting\nin the two-parameter family of transverse spatial surfaces. This geometry is described by the formalism of dual-null\ndynamics [34,35], summarized in this section. Denoting the space-time metric by g and labelling the null hypersurfaces\nby x\u00b1 , the normal 1-forms n\u00b1 = \u2212dx\u00b1 therefore satisfy\n2\n\n\fg \u22121 (n\u00b1 , n\u00b1 ) = 0.\n\n(1)\n\nThe relative normalization of the null normals may be encoded in a function f defined by\nef = \u2212g \u22121 (n+ , n\u2212 ).\n\n(2)\n\nThen the induced metric on the transverse surfaces, the spatial surfaces of intersection, is found to be\nh = g + 2e\u2212f n+ \u2297 n\u2212\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u2297 denotes the symmetric tensor product. The dynamics is generated by two commuting evolution vectors u\u00b1 :\n[u+ , u\u2212 ] = 0\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the brackets denote the Lie bracket or commutator. Thus there is an integrable evolution space spanned by\n(u+ , u\u2212 ). The evolution derivatives, to be discretized in a numerical code, are the projected Lie derivatives\n(5)\n\n\u2206\u00b1 = \u22a5Lu\u00b1\nwhere \u22a5 indicates projection by h and L denotes the Lie derivative. There are two shift vectors\ns\u00b1 = \u22a5u\u00b1 .\n\n(6)\n\nIn a coordinate basis (u+ , u\u2212 , e1 , e2 ) such that u\u00b1 = \u2202/\u2202x\u00b1 , where ea = \u2202/\u2202xa is a basis for the transverse surfaces,\nthe metric takes the form\ng = hab (dxa + sa+ dx+ + sa\u2212 dx\u2212 ) \u2297 (dxb + sb+ dx+ + sb\u2212 dx\u2212 ) \u2212 2e\u2212f dx+ \u2297 dx\u2212 .\n\n(7)\n\nThen (h, f, s\u00b1 ) are configuration fields and the independent momentum fields are found to be linear combinations of\n\u03b8\u00b1\n\u03c3\u00b1\n\u03bd\u00b1\n\u03c9\n\n=  \u0304\u2217L\u00b1  \u0304\u22171\n= \u22a5L\u00b1 h \u2212 \u03b8\u00b1 h\n= L\u00b1 f\n= 12 ef h([l\u2212 , l+ ])\n\n(8)\n(9)\n(10)\n(11)\n\nwhere  \u0304\u2217 is the Hodge operator of h and L\u00b1 is shorthand for the Lie derivative along the null normal vectors\nl\u00b1 = u\u00b1 \u2212 s\u00b1 = e\u2212f g \u22121 (n\u2213 )\n\n(12)\n\nwhich will be assumed to be future-null. Then the functions \u03b8\u00b1 are the expansions, the traceless bilinear forms \u03c3\u00b1 are\nthe shears, the 1-form \u03c9 is the twist, measuring the lack of integrability of the normal space, and the functions \u03bd\u00b1 are\nthe inaffinities, measuring the failure of the null normals to be affine. The fields (\u03b8\u00b1 , \u03c3\u00b1 , \u03bd\u00b1 , \u03c9) encode the extrinsic\ncurvature of the dual-null foliation. These extrinsic fields are unique up to duality \u00b1 7\u2192 \u2213 and diffeomorphisms which\nrelabel the null hypersurfaces, i.e. dx\u00b1 7\u2192 e\u03bb\u00b1 dx\u00b1 for functions \u03bb\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ).\nThe dual-null Hamilton equations and integrability conditions for vacuum Einstein gravity have been given previously in a different notation [35]. They are linear combinations of the vacuum Einstein equation and a first integral\nof the contracted Bianchi identity. It is straightforward to add matter: denoting the projections of the energy tensor\nT by T\u00b1\u00b1 = T (l\u00b1 , l\u00b1 ), T+\u2212 = T (l+ , l\u2212 ) and T\u00b1 = \u22a5T (l\u00b1 ), the resulting field equations are\n2\nL\u00b1 \u03b8\u00b1 = \u2212\u03bd\u00b1 \u03b8\u00b1 \u2212 12 \u03b8\u00b1\n\u2212 14 |\u03c3\u00b1 |2 \u2212 8\u03c0T\u00b1\u00b1\n\n(13)\n\n1\n2R\n\n\u0001\nL\u00b1 \u03b8\u2213 = \u2212\u03b8+ \u03b8\u2212 \u2212 e\n\u2212 | 12 Df \u00b1 \u03c9|2 + D * ( 21 Df \u00b1 \u03c9)\u266f + 8\u03c0T+\u2212\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u266f\n\u2212 21 \u03b8+ \u03b8\u2212 \u2212 e\u2212f 21 R \u2212 3|\u03c9|2 + 41 |Df |2 \u00b1 \u03c9 \u266f * Df + 8\u03c0 T+\u2212 + 21 e\u2212f h\u266f : T\nL\u00b1 \u03bd\u2213 = 41 \u03c3+ : \u03c3\u2212\n\u2212f\n\n\u22a5L\u00b1 \u03c9 = \u2212\u03b8\u00b1 \u03c9 \u00b1\n\n1\n\u266f\n2 (D\n\n\u266f\n\n\u22a5L\u00b1 \u03c3\u2213 = \u03c3+ * h * \u03c3\u2212 \u00b1\n\u2212e\n\n\u2212f\n\n\u2212f \u266f\n\n| 21 Df\n\n* \u03c3\u00b1 \u2212 D\u03b8\u00b1 + D\u03bd\u00b1 \u2212 \u03b8\u00b1 Df ) \u2213 8\u03c0T\u00b1\n\n1\n2 (\u03b8+ \u03c3\u2212\n2\n\n\u2212 \u03b8\u2212 \u03c3+ ) + 2e\n\n\u00b1 \u03c9| \u2212 D *\n\n\u22a5 (L+ s\u2212 \u2212 L\u2212 s+ ) = 2e h * \u03c9 + [s\u2212 , s+ ]\n\u22a5L\u00b1 h = \u03b8\u00b1 h + \u03c3\u00b1\nL \u00b1 f = \u03bd\u00b1\n\n( 12 Df\n\n\u2212f\n\n\u266f\n\n\u0001\n\n( 12 Df\n\n\u00b1 \u03c9) h +\n\n3\n\n\u00b1 \u03c9) \u2297 ( 12 Df \u00b1 \u03c9) \u2212 D\n\u0001\n8\u03c0e\u2212f \u22a5T \u2212 12 (h\u266f : T )h\n\n\u2297\n\n( 21 Df\n\n\u0001\n\u00b1 \u03c9)\n\n(14)\n(15)\n(16)\n(17)\n(18)\n(19)\n(20)\n\n\fwhere D is the covariant derivative and R the Ricci scalar of h, a dot denotes symmetric contraction, a colon denotes\ndouble symmetric contraction, a sharp (\u266f) denotes the contravariant dual with respect to h\u22121 = h\u266f (index raising),\na flat (\u266d) will denote the covariant dual with respect to h (index lowering), |\u03c9|2 = \u03c9 * \u03c9 \u266f and |\u03c3|2 = \u03c3 : \u03c3 \u266f . Units\nare such that Newton's gravitational constant is unity. This is the Einstein system in first-order dual-null form; the\nequations will simply be called the field equations. The second-order version obtained by eliminating the momentum\nfields and symmetrizing in L(+ L\u2212) are the Einstein equations themselves.\nIII. QUASI-SPHERICAL APPROXIMATIONS\n\nThe dual-null fields and operators fall into two classes, those which vanish in spherical symmetry, (\u03c3\u00b1 , \u03c9, s\u00b1 , D),\nand those which generally do not, (\u03b8\u00b1 , \u03bd\u00b1 , h, f, \u2206\u00b1 ) [33,36]. The first quasi-spherical approximation [27] therefore\nconsisted of linearizing in (\u03c3\u00b1 , \u03c9, s\u00b1 , D). It was then noticed that the gravitational radiation is encoded in the shear\ntensors \u03c3\u00b1 [29], as will be explained in more detail in the following. This suggests that retaining non-linear terms in\n\u03c3\u00b1 would give a more accurate approximation for the gravitational-radiation sector of the theory. Thus the second\nquasi-spherical approximation consists of linearizing in (\u03c9, s\u00b1 , D) only. For a given matter model, one would also have\nto decide which decomposed matter fields to linearize. In this article, no specific matter model will be fixed, but the\nmatter energy tensor T will be retained for generality and assumed to be consistently truncated.\nMore formally, one may introduce two expansion parameters into the full field equations, \u01eb1 preceding \u03c3\u00b1 and \u01eb0\npreceding (\u03c9, s\u00b1 , D). Then both approximations ignore terms o(\u01eb0 ), whereas the first approximation ignores terms\no(\u01eb1 ). Then \u01eb1 measures the strength of the gravitational radiation, whereas \u01eb0 measures other asphericities, due to\nangular momentum or other transverse effects. The terminology \"first and second order\" has been carefully avoided\nbecause the true second-order quasi-spherical approximation would be full Einstein gravity, since the only non-linear\nterms in the full field equations are second-order in the dynamical fields and operators. However, one may say that\nthe second approximation is second-order in the gravitational radiation.\nIt is useful to decompose the transverse metric h into a conformal factor r and a transverse conformal metric k by\nh = r2 k\n\n(21)\n\n\u2206\u00b1 \u02c6\u22171 = 0\n\n(22)\n\nsuch that\n\nwhere \u02c6\u2217 is the Hodge operator of k, satisfying  \u0304\u22171 = \u02c6\u2217r2 . The Ricci scalar of h is found to be\nR = 2r\u22122 (1 \u2212 D2 ln r)\n\n(23)\n\nby using the coordinate freedom on a given surface to fix k as the metric of a unit sphere. One may take quasi-spherical\ncoordinates xa = (\u03b8, \u03c6) on the transverse surfaces to obtain the standard area form of a unit sphere:\n\u02c6\u22171 = sin \u03b8 d\u03b8 \u2227 d\u03c6\n\n(24)\n\nwhere \u2227 denotes the exterior product of forms. Then r is the quasi-spherical radius. Approximations for rough\ncylindrical or plane symmetry could similarly be produced. A useful truncation identity, holding in both first and\nsecond approximations, is\n\u2206\u00b1 = \u22a5L\u00b1 .\n\n(25)\n\nThis will be used throughout the article without further reference, with \u2206\u00b1 rather than L\u00b1 appearing explicitly.\nIn the first approximation, the truncated field equations decouple into a three-level hierarchy. The first-level\nequations\n\u2206\u00b1 r = 12 r\u03b8\u00b1\n\u2206\u00b1 f = \u03bd\u00b1\n2\n\u2206\u00b1 \u03b8\u00b1 = \u2212\u03bd\u00b1 \u03b8\u00b1 \u2212 12 \u03b8\u00b1\n\u2212 8\u03c0T\u00b1\u00b1\n\n\u2206\u00b1 \u03b8\u2213 = \u2212\u03b8+ \u03b8\u2212 \u2212 e\u2212f r\u22122 + 8\u03c0T+\u2212\n\u2206\u00b1 \u03bd\u2213 = \u2212 21 \u03b8+ \u03b8\u2212 \u2212 e\u2212f r\u22122 + 8\u03c0(T+\u2212 + 21 e\u2212f h\u266f : T )\n4\n\n(26)\n(27)\n(28)\n(29)\n(30)\n\n\fhave the same form as in spherical symmetry. These equations, the quasi-spherical equations, therefore determine a\nquasi-spherical background. The second-level equations\n\u2206\u00b1 k = r\u22122 \u03c3\u00b1\n\u2206\u00b1 \u03c3\u2213 = 12 (\u03b8\u00b1 \u03c3\u2213 \u2212 \u03b8\u2213 \u03c3\u00b1 ) + \u03c3+ * h\u266f * \u03c3\u2212 + 8\u03c0e\u2212f (\u22a5T \u2212 21 (h\u266f : T )h)\n\n(31)\n(32)\n\nconstitute a wave equation for k, describing the gravitational-wave propagation, as explained in detail in the following.\nThe quadratic shear term in the shear propagation equation (32) was omitted in the original reference [27]. The thirdlevel equations for (\u03c9, s\u00b1 ) need not be solved for the radiation problem. This is because, fixing u+ to be the outgoing\ndirection, the Bondi news at null infinity I\u00b1 is essentially \u03c3\u2213 /r [37]. This determines the strain to be measured by\na gravitational-wave detector, as explained in the penultimate section.\nIn the second approximation, the truncated field equations also decouple, this time into only two levels, with the\nlast level for (\u03c9, s\u00b1 ) again being irrelevant to the radiation problem. The remaining equations are\n\u2206\u00b1 r\n\u2206\u00b1 f\n\u2206\u00b1 k\n\u2206\u00b1 \u03b8\u00b1\n\n= 12 r\u03b8\u00b1\n= \u03bd\u00b1\n= r\u22122 \u03c3\u00b1\n2\n= \u2212\u03bd\u00b1 \u03b8\u00b1 \u2212 12 \u03b8\u00b1\n\u2212 14 |\u03c3\u00b1 |2 \u2212 8\u03c0T\u00b1\u00b1\n\n\u2206\u00b1 \u03b8\u2213 = \u2212\u03b8+ \u03b8\u2212 \u2212 e\u2212f r\u22122 + 8\u03c0T+\u2212\n\n\u2206\u00b1 \u03bd\u2213 =\n\u2206\u00b1 \u03c3\u2213 =\n\n\u266f\n\u2212 21 \u03b8+ \u03b8\u2212 \u2212 e\u2212f r\u22122 + 14 \u03c3+ : \u03c3\u2212\n+ 8\u03c0(T+\u2212 + 21 e\u2212f h\u266f : T )\n1\n\u266f\n\u2212f\n(\u22a5T \u2212 12 (h\u266f : T )h).\n2 (\u03b8\u00b1 \u03c3\u2213 \u2212 \u03b8\u2213 \u03c3\u00b1 ) + \u03c3+ * h * \u03c3\u2212 + 8\u03c0e\n\n(33)\n(34)\n(35)\n(36)\n(37)\n(38)\n(39)\n\nThe dual-null initial-data formulation is based on a spatial surface S and the null hypersurfaces \u03a3\u00b1 locally generated\nfrom S in the u\u00b1 directions. The structure of the truncated field equations shows that one may specify (\u03b8\u00b1 , r, f, k) on\nS, (\u03c3+ , \u03bd+ ) on \u03a3+ and (\u03c3\u2212 , \u03bd\u2212 ) on \u03a3\u2212 . In particular, the initial data is freely specifiable. In summary, the vacuum\nsystem consists of nine first-order differential equations and their duals.\nMathematically, the difference between first and second approximations is that in the first approximation, the\nequations for the quasi-spherical variables (\u03b8\u00b1 , \u03bd\u00b1 , r, f ) decouple from the equations for the wave variables (\u03c3\u00b1 , k).\nPhysically this describes gravitational-wave propagation on a quasi-spherical background. The background is not\nfixed in advance and need not be spherically symmetric, so even the first approximation is widely applicable. There is\nno such decoupling in the second approximation: the gravitational-wave terms (\u03c3\u00b1 , k) now enter the equations for the\nquasi-spherical part of the geometry, so there is no longer a background which is independent of the waves. Physically\nthis corresponds to including radiation reaction, as clarified in the next section.\nNevertheless, both first and second approximations share the remarkable feature that, to compute the observable waveforms, no transverse D derivatives need be considered. The truncated equations form an effectively twodimensional system, to be integrated independently at each angle of the sphere. Physically this means that the\nobserved gravitational-wave signal depends only on the line of sight to the source, surely a plausible result. Moreover,\nby virtue of the dual-null formulation, the equations are already written in characteristic form, the mathematically\nstandard form for analysis of hyperbolic equations. Numerical implementation is consequently straightforward and\ncomputationally inexpensive. Numerical codes exist for both first and second approximations [28].\nIV. GRAVITATIONAL RADIATION: LOCAL ENERGY TENSOR\n\nThe truncated equations in the second quasi-spherical approximation, (33)\u2013(39), differ from those of the first, (26)\u2013\n(32), by terms quadratic in the shear tensors \u03c3\u00b1 , which appear additively with terms involving the energy tensor of\nthe matter. Specifically, the second approximation may be obtained from the first by replacing the matter energy\ntensor T with T + \u0398, where\n\u266f\n\u0398\u00b1\u00b1 = \u03c3\u00b1 : \u03c3\u00b1\n/32\u03c0\n\u0398+\u2212 = 0\n\u266f\n\u22a5\u0398 = ef (\u03c3+ : \u03c3\u2212\n)h/32\u03c0.\n\n(40)\n(41)\n(42)\n\nThus \u0398 playes the role of an effective energy tensor for the gravitational radiation. Written covariantly in terms of\nthe transverse conformal metric k, this defines the energy tensor of the gravitational radiation:\n\n5\n\n\f\u0398\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\nh\u2206\u03b1 k, \u2206\u03b2 ki \u2212 21 g\u03b1\u03b2 g \u03b3\u03b4 h\u2206\u03b3 k, \u2206\u03b4 ki\n32\u03c0\n\n(43)\n\nwhere h\u03b1, \u03b2i = k ab k cd \u03b1ac \u03b2bd is the transverse conformal inner product and \u2206 = dx+ \u2206+ + dx\u2212 \u2206\u2212 is the 1-form\nevolution derivative.\nMore formally, in terms of the expansion parameters \u01eb0 and \u01eb1 , one may introduce a truncated Einstein tensor C\ndefined in terms of the full Einstein tensor G by\n2\nC\u00b1\u00b1 = lim lim G\u00b1\u00b1 = \u2212\u2206\u00b1 \u03b8\u00b1 \u2212 \u03bd\u00b1 \u03b8\u00b1 \u2212 21 \u03b8\u00b1\n\n(44)\n\nC+\u2212 = lim lim G+\u2212 = \u2206+ \u03b8\u2212 + \u03b8+ \u03b8\u2212 + e\u2212f r\u22122\n\n(45)\n\n\u01eb1 \u21920 \u01eb0 \u21920\n\n\u01eb1 \u21920 \u01eb0 \u21920\n\nh\u266f : C = lim lim h\u266f : G = ef (2\u2206+ \u03bd\u2212 \u2212 2\u2206+ \u03b8\u2212 \u2212 \u03b8+ \u03b8\u2212 )\n\u01eb1 \u21920 \u01eb0 \u21920\n\nC\u0303 = lim G\u0303 = ef (\u2206(+ \u03c3\u2212) \u2212 \u03c3+ * h\u266f * \u03c3\u2212 )\n\u01eb0 \u21920\n\n(46)\n(47)\n\nwhere C\u0303 = \u22a5C \u2212 21 (h\u266f * C)h and the C\u00b1 components are irrelevant to the radiation problem. Then\nC = 8\u03c0T\n\n(48)\n\nare the truncated Einstein equations of the first approximation, obtained from (26)\u2013(32), whereas\nC = 8\u03c0(T + \u0398)\n\n(49)\n\nare the truncated Einstein equations of the second approximation, obtained from (33)\u2013(39). This demonstrates that \u0398\nis an energy tensor for the gravitational radiation, in the sense that it is included as an effective matter energy tensor\nin the second approximation. Gravitational radiation reaction, the back-reaction of the radiation on the space-time,\nhas thereby been included.\nIt should be stressed that (i) mathematically, \u0398 is a genuine tensor, but depends on the dual-null foliation, not\njust on the space-time; (ii) the physical interpretation of \u0398 as energy requires the quasi-spherical approximation to\nbe valid, meaning that the transverse surfaces must indeed be roughly spherical. This will not be made precise here,\nas the range of validity of the approximation is not clear in advance and best explored in applications. The intuitive\nmeaning of roughly spherical should be clear by any standards.\nIn summary, the quasi-spherical approximation allows a local definition of the energy-momentum-stress of gravitational radiation, and therefore of the radiation itself: gravitational radiation is present at a given point if and only if\n\u0398 is non-zero there. With the orientation such that u+ is the outgoing null direction, there is outgoing radiation if\nand only if \u2206\u2212 k (equivalently \u03c3\u2212 ) is non-zero, and ingoing radiation if and only if \u2206+ k (equivalently \u03c3+ ) is non-zero.\nThe terminology gravitational radiation rather than wave is generally preferable, since \u2206\u00b1 k need not be oscillatory.\nInstead, frequency spectra for ingoing and outgoing radiation may be defined by Fourier transformations to frequency\nf+ and f\u2212 respectively:\nZ\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\ne\u22122\u03c0if\u00b1 x k(x\u00b1 )dx\u00b1\n(50)\nk (f\u00b1 ) =\n\u03b3\n\nwhere \u03b3 is a curve of constant (x\u2213 , \u03b8, \u03c6). If the Fourier transform is peaked in frequency space, one may say that\nthere is a gravitational wave. In contrast, gravitational radiation is defined even when there is no typical frequency.\nThis clearly indicates that the approximation has a different physical basis to that of the Isaacson high-frequency\napproximation [24,25], which is usually quoted to make sense of linearized gravitational waves.\nThe non-zero components of \u0398 may be written as\n\u0398\u00b1\u00b1 = ||\u2206\u00b1 k||2 /32\u03c0\n\u22a5\u0398 = ef h\u2206+ k, \u2206\u2212 kih/32\u03c0\n\n(51)\n(52)\n\nwhere ||\u03b1||2 = h\u03b1, \u03b1i is the transverse conformal norm. Then the \u0398\u00b1\u00b1 components have a similar form to those of the\ngravitational-wave energy tensor of the high-frequency approximation [24,25], with k replacing the transverse traceless\nmetric perturbation. However, the high-frequency approximation requires averaging over several wavelengths and has\nno term proportional to g. In this connection, it seems that the quasi-spherical situation allows a natural choice of\ntransverse traceless gauge and eliminates the need for averaging. Earlier attempts to construct pseudotensors for\ngravitational waves by Einstein and others might be converted to genuine tensors by similar gauge-fixing adapted to\nthe transverse surfaces, but currently such pseudotensors are generally not accepted.\n6\n\n\fApart from the fact that a gravitational wave generally has two polarizations, as encoded in the two independent\ncomponents of k, \u0398 is analogous to the energy tensor of Einstein-Rosen gravitational waves [38], which takes the\nmassless Klein-Gordon form in terms of a gravitational potential generalizing the Newtonian potential. In both\ncases, there is generally a transverse radiation pressure, given by \u22a5\u0398, produced by a combination of ingoing and\noutgoing gravitational radiation, as well as the expected radial radiation pressure. The fact that \u0398+\u2212 = 0 may be\ninterpreted as meaning that gravitational radiation is purely radiative and workless, as for the massless (but not\nmassive) Klein-Gordon field.\nAs an energy tensor, \u0398 satisfies the strong, dominant, weak and null energy conditions [39], as follows. The dominant\nenergy condition, requiring that an observer measures future-causal momentum, may be stated as T (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2265 0 for two\nfuture-causal vectors \u03b1, \u03b2. Writing the vectors as\n\u03b1 = a+ l+ + a\u2212 l\u2212 + (2e\u2212f a+ a\u2212 )1/2 a\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b2 = b l+ + b l\u2212 + (2e\n\n\u2212f + \u2212 1/2\n\nb b )\n\nb\n\n\u22a5a = a\n\n\u22a5b = b\n\n(53)\n(54)\n\nthe future-causal conditions imply a\u00b1 \u2265 0, b\u00b1 \u2265 0, |a| \u2264 1, |b| \u2264 1 and therefore 0 \u2264 a * b\u266d \u2264 1. Then\n32\u03c0\u0398(\u03b1, \u03b2) = a * b\u266d (a+ b+ )1/2 \u2206+ k + (a\u2212 b\u2212 )1/2 \u2206\u2212 k\n\n2\n\n\u0001\n+ (1 \u2212 a * b\u266d ) a+ b+ ||\u2206+ k||2 + a\u2212 b\u2212 ||\u2206\u2212 k||2 \u2265 0.\n\n(55)\n\nThus \u0398 satisfies the dominant energy condition and therefore also the weak and null energy conditions. The strong\nenergy condition states that T (\u03b1, \u03b1) \u2265 0 where T = T \u2212 12 (g \u22121 : T )g. Since\n\u0398\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\nh\u2206\u03b1 k, \u2206\u03b2 ki\n32\u03c0\n\n(56)\n\nthis follows more simply as\n32\u03c0\u0398(\u03b1, \u03b2) = a+ \u2206+ k + a\u2212 \u2206\u2212 k\n\n2\n\n\u2265 0.\n\n(57)\n\nThus by all standard measures, gravitational radiation carries positive energy, a physically expected property.\nV. BLACK HOLES: MASS, SURFACE GRAVITY\n\nA general definition of dynamic black holes was proposed previously [30,31]. A transverse surface is said to be\ntrapped if \u03b8+ \u03b8\u2212 > 0, marginal if \u03b8+ = 0 or \u03b8\u2212 = 0 and untrapped if \u03b8+ \u03b8\u2212 < 0, also previously called mean convex [37].\nSuch definitions may also be applied independently at each spherical angle. The surface is future trapped if \u03b8\u00b1 < 0\nand past trapped if \u03b8\u00b1 > 0, or future marginal if \u03b8\u2212 < 0 (for \u03b8+ = 0) and past marginal if \u03b8\u2212 > 0. An untrapped\nsurface has a preferred spatial orientation [37]: if \u03b8+ > 0 and \u03b8\u2212 < 0, then \u2206+ is outward and \u2206\u2212 inward. Similarly\nany spatial direction normal to the surface is outward or inward as its component along \u2206+ is positive or negative\nrespectively. Future or past marginal surfaces similarly have a preferred spatial orientation. A trapping horizon is a\nhypersurface foliated by marginal surfaces. It is an outer trapping horizon if L\u2212 \u03b8+ < 0 (for \u03b8+ = 0) and an inner\ntrapping horizon if L\u2212 \u03b8+ > 0, where the dual-null foliation is adapted to the marginal surfaces. A future (respectively\npast) outer trapping horizon is proposed as the local, dynamical definition of a non-degenerate black (respectively\nwhite) hole. A degenerate black hole is one for which \u03b8+ is decreasing in the L\u2212 direction, but L\u2212 \u03b8+ is not strictly\nnegative.\nThese ideas of gravitational trapping may also be expressed in terms of the quasi-spherical radius r, as in spherical\nsymmetry [33], as follows. A transverse surface is trapped, marginal or untrapped as \u2206\u266f r is temporal, null or spatial\nrespectively. If \u2206\u266f r is future (respectively past) temporal or null, then the surface is future (respectively past) trapped\nor marginal. On an untrapped or marginal surface, an achronal (spatial or null) normal direction is outward or inward\nas r is increasing or decreasing respectively. A trapping horizon is outer or inner as \u22062 r > 0 or \u22062 r < 0 respectively,\nwhere \u22062 = \u2206\u266f * \u2206.\nIn spherical symmetry, there is an active gravitational mass-energy with many desired properties [33,36]. A quasispherical mass-energy may be defined similarly as\nm = 12 r(1 \u2212 \u2206r * \u2206\u266f r).\n\n(58)\n\nThis is the simplest generalization which has the property that a transverse surface is trapped, marginal or untrapped\nif and only if r < 2m, r = 2m or r > 2m respectively. Physically, m includes the energy of the gravitational field, as\n7\n\n\fwill be seen below in the first law. Similarly, the spherically symmetric m yields, in a post-Newtonian expansion, the\nNewtonian mass, gravitational potential energy, kinetic energy and thermal energy of a thermodynamic material [33].\nA canonical flow of time is generated by the vector\n\u03be = (\u2217dr)\u266f = (\u2217\u2206r)\u266f\n\n(59)\n\nwhere \u2217 is the Hodge operator of the evolution space, \u22171 = e\u2212f dx+ \u2227 dx\u2212 . One may define \u03be equivalently, up to sign,\nby\n\u03be * \u2206r = 0\n\n(60)\n\n\u266d\n\n\u266f\n\n\u03be * \u03be = \u2212\u2206r * \u2206 r\n\u266d\n\n\u22a5\u03be = 0.\n\n(61)\n(62)\n\nThen a sphere is trapped, marginal or untrapped as \u03be is spatial, null or temporal respectively. In particular, trapping\nhorizons may equivalently be defined as hypersurfaces where \u03be is null. In these and other ways, \u03be is analogous to the\nKilling vector of a stationary space-time or the Kodama vector of a spherically symmetric space-time [33,36].\nDenoting the Hodge operator of g by \u22c6, there is the truncation identity\n\u22c6 1 = \u22171 \u2227  \u0304\u22171 = \u22171 \u2227 \u02c6\u2217r2\n\n(63)\n\nsince the terms in the shifts s\u00b1 are quadratic. Then\n\u2207 * \u03be = \u22c6d\u22c6\u03be \u266d = \u22c6d(dr \u2227 \u02c6\u2217r2 ) = r\u22122 \u2217d(r2 dr) = 0.\n\n(64)\n\nThus \u03be is covariantly conserved. This Noether current therefore admits a Noether charge 2-form Q\u03be such that\n\u03be \u266d = \u22c6dQ\u03be .\n\n(65)\n\nQ\u03be = \u02c6\u2217 31 r3 .\n\n(66)\n\nReversing the above calculation yields\n\nThus the integrated charge over a transverse surface is\nI\nV = Q\u03be =\n\n1\n3\n\nH\n\n\u02c6\u2217r3\n\n(67)\n\nwhich is the average radial volume.\nA dynamic surface gravity \u03ba may be defined, generalizing that of the spherically symmetric case [33], by\n\u22a4(\u03be * d\u03be \u266d ) = \u03ba\u2206r\n\n(68)\n\nwhere \u22a4 indicates projection onto the evolution space. That is, the 1-forms on each side of the equation are proportional in the quasi-spherical truncation, and \u03ba is defined as the proportionality constant. Since \u03be \u266d = \u00b1\u2206r on a\ntrapping horizon, this reduces on such a horizon to\n\u22a4(\u03be * d\u03be \u266d ) = \u00b1\u03ba\u03be \u266d\n\n(69)\n\nwhich is analogous to the usual definition of stationary surface gravity, with \u03be replacing the stationary Killing vector.\nA calculation shows that\n\u03ba = 12 \u22062 r.\n\n(70)\n\nTherefore a trapping horizon is outer or inner as \u03ba > 0 or \u03ba < 0 respectively. Also, \u03ba vanishes where a black hole\nbecomes degenerate, a desired property of surface gravity. Note that \u03ba is defined everywhere in the space-time, not\njust on horizons. Physically, \u03ba is a gravitational acceleration, a relativistic version of the Newtonian gravitational\nacceleration or force per unit mass.\n\n8\n\n\fVI. ENERGY CONSERVATION: FIRST LAW\n\nThe truncated field equations (33)\u2013(39) imply that the mass-energy m (58) is propagated as\n\u2206\u00b1 m = 4\u03c0r2 ef (T+\u2212 \u2206\u00b1 r \u2212 (T\u00b1\u00b1 + \u0398\u00b1\u00b1 )\u2206\u2213 r)\n\n(71)\n\nwhere the terms in \u0398 (43) appear in the second but not the first approximation. This may be written more covariantly\nas the unified first law\n\u2206m = 4\u03c0r2 (\u03c8 + w\u2206r)\n\n(72)\n\nin terms of the work density (an energy density)\nw = ef T+\u2212\n\n(73)\n\n\u03c8 = \u03c8[T ] + \u03c8[\u0398]\n\n(74)\n\nand the energy flux (a 1-form)\n\nwhich has been divided into contributions from the matter and the gravitational radiation:\n\u03c8[T ] = \u22a4(T * \u2206\u266f r) + w\u2206r\n\u03c8[\u0398] = \u22a4(\u0398 * \u2206\u266f r).\n\n(75)\n(76)\n\nThe terms in the first law (72) involving \u03c8 and w may be interpreted as energy-supply and work terms respectively,\nanalogous to the heat supply and work in the classical first law of thermodynamics [40]. The unified first law was\nso called because it was shown in spherical symmetry that projecting it along the flow of a thermodynamic fluid\nyields a first law of relativistic thermodynamics, while projecting it along a trapping horizon yields a first law of\nblack-hole dynamics [33]. It also includes the Bondi energy-loss equation at I+ , with m reducing to the Bondi mass,\nr2 \u03c8 reducing to the Bondi flux and w reducing to zero. The quasi-spherical first law (72) is unified in another sense:\nit includes the energy flux of the gravitational radiation, as also occurs for the first law in cylindrical symmetry [38].\nThe energy-momentum density of the matter, referred to the canonical flow of time, is the vector j[T ] given by\nj \u266d [T ] = \u2212\u22a4(T * \u03be).\n\n(77)\n\nIn spherical symmetry, the analogous j[T ] is also conserved [33,36]. This also holds in the first but not second quasispherical approximation, the physical reason being that gravitational radiation carries energy. The energy-momentum\ndensity of the gravitational radiation is the vector j[\u0398] given by\nj \u266d [\u0398] = \u2212\u22a4(\u0398 * \u03be).\n\n(78)\n\nThe energy fluxes are essentially duals of the energy-momentum densities:\n\u2217j \u266d [T ] = \u03c8[T ] + w\u2206r\n\u266d\n\n\u2217j [\u0398] = \u03c8[\u0398].\n\n(79)\n(80)\n\nIt follows from the first law that the combined energy-momentum density\nj = j[T ] + j[\u0398]\n\n(81)\n\n(\u2217\u2206m)\u266f\n(\u2217dm)\u266f\n=\n.\n4\u03c0r2\n4\u03c0r2\n\n(82)\n\nis given by\nj=\n\nThen, again using the truncation identity (63), j is covariantly conserved:\n\u2207 * j = \u22c6d\u22c6j \u266d =\n\n\u22c6d(dm \u2227 \u02c6\u22171)\n\u2217ddm\n= 0.\n=\n4\u03c0\n4\u03c0r2\n\n(83)\n\nPhysically this represents conservation of energy for the gravitational radiation and matter combined. The Noether\ncharge 2-form Qj associated with the Noether current j is given by\n9\n\n\fj \u266d = \u22c6dQj .\n\n(84)\n\nReversing the above calculation yields\nQj =\n\n\u02c6\u2217m\n4\u03c0\n\nor essentially the mass-energy m. The integrated charge over a transverse surface is\nI\nI\n1\n\u02c6\u2217m\nm = Qj =\n4\u03c0\n\n(85)\n\n(86)\n\nwhich is the average mass-energy. Thus the first law (72) is a first integral of the energy conservation equation (83). A\ngeneral method for defining mass-energy by Noether charges has been recently suggested [41]. In summary, there is an\nenergy conservation law for the combined energy-momentum of the matter and gravitational radiation. Physically this\nshows how energy may be locally transferred between matter and gravitational radiation, the balance being accounted\nby the active gravitational mass-energy m.\nVII. BLACK-HOLE DYNAMICS: LAWS, INEQUALITIES\n\nA general local theory of black-hole dynamics was initiated a few years ago [30] and recently reviewed [32]. The\nsecond law of black-hole dynamics [30] states that the area element of a future outer trapping horizon is non-decreasing,\nassuming the null energy condition. Thus\nr\u2032 \u2265 0\n\n(87)\n\nwhere the prime denotes the derivative along a vector generating the marginal surfaces, with orientation such that,\nwhen r\u2032 = 0, it is future-null. This is related to the signature law [30], that an outer trapping horizon is achronal\nH\n(spatial or null), being null if and only if r\u2032 = 0. The local second law implies an integral version: the area A = \u02c6\u2217r2\nof the marginal surfaces is also non-decreasing, A\u2032 \u2265 0. Since r = 2m on a trapping horizon, the second law also\nimplies\nm\u2032 \u2265 0\n\n(88)\n\nso that the black-hole mass is also non-decreasing. A similar monotonicity property of m holds in an untrapped\nregion, as follows. It is straightforward to show that \u03c8[\u0398] is past (respectively future) causal in future (respectively\npast) trapped regions, and outward achronal in untrapped regions. The same holds for \u03c8[T ] assuming the null energy\ncondition. Also, the dominant energy condition implies w \u2265 0. Therefore projecting the first law (72) along an\noutward achronal direction, m is non-decreasing in that direction. This generalizes the monotonicity property of m\nin spherical symmetry [36] and correspondingly yields two important inequalities. Firstly, positivity: in an untrapped\nregion achronally outward from a regular centre,\nm\u22650\n\n(89)\n\nsince m vanishes at a regular centre. Secondly, in an untrapped region achronally outward from a marginal surface\nwith r = r0 ,\nm \u2265 r0 /2\n\n(90)\n\nwhich is a local version of the Penrose inequality for black holes. These inequalities extend to the asymptotic mass\nat I\u00b1 or spatial infinity i0 in an asymptotically flat space-time, as in spherical symmetry [36].\nAn explicit expression for the surface gravity (70) follows from the truncated equations of either first or second\napproximations, (33)\u2013(39):\n\u03ba=\n\nm\n\u2212 4\u03c0rw.\nr2\n\n(91)\n\nIn vacuo, this has the same form as Newton's inverse-square law of gravitation, combined with local equivalence of\ninertial and passive gravitational mass. The dominant energy condition yields the inequality\n\n10\n\n\fm \u2265 r2 \u03ba.\n\n(92)\n\nAlso, in an untrapped region or on a trapping horizon, r \u2265 2m,\n\u03ba\u2264\n\n1\n.\n2r\n\n(93)\n\nThis means that, for a black hole of given size, the surface gravity cannot exceed a given amount. Both inequalities\ngeneralize those given in spherical symmetry [33]. They may also be combined with the Penrose inequality (90) and\ngeneralized to include charge [42].\nSince (m/r)\u2032 = 0 along a trapping horizon, (91) implies\nm\u2032 =\n\n\u03ba\n(4\u03c0r2 )\u2032 + w(4\u03c0r2 r\u2032 ).\n8\u03c0\n\n(94)\n\nThis is the first law of black-hole dynamics, the projection of the unified first law (72) along a trapping horizon. It\nhas the same form as that of spherical symmetry [33], involving the radial area 4\u03c0r2 rather than the actual area A of\na marginal surface. This suggests that dynamic black holes may in some sense admit a local Hawking temperature\n\u03ba/2\u03c0 and a gravitational entropy \u03c0r2 [43]. It is noteworthy that, away from spherical symmetry, this entropy is\ngenerally not A/4. However, this is consistent with the usual result for a Kerr black hole, which has horizon area\nA = 4\u03c0r2 = 4\u03c0(r\u03032 + a2 ), where r\u0303 is the usual Kerr radial function [28].\nA zeroth law of black-hole dynamics, generalizing that of spherical symmetry [32], also follows from (91): if r and w\nare constant on a trapping horizon, then so is the surface gravity \u03ba. Here constant r is a local equilibrium condition\nfor the horizon, with constant w being a similar condition for the matter. It should be stressed that these three laws\nof black-hole dynamics all differ from the textbook laws of black-hole mechanics [11,12], for which the zeroth and\nfirst laws refer to stationary black holes, specifically to a Killing horizon, while the second law refers to a physically\nunlocatable concept, event horizon.\nVIII. GRAVITATIONAL-WAVE DYNAMICS: COMPLEX POTENTIAL, WAVE EQUATION\n\nThe shear equations (35), (39), composed into a second-order equation for the transverse conformal metric k,\nbecome, taking the vacuum case,\n\u0001\n\u2206(+ r2 k \u22121 * \u2206\u2212) k = 0.\n(95)\n\nThis equation describes the propagation of the gravitational radiation, or the gravitational-wave dynamics. The\noriginal reference [27] omitted the k \u22121 factor as a consequential error from (32). To gain more insight into this wave\nequation, it is useful to decompose the gravitational radiation into two independent polarizations. A convenient choice\nof variables turns out to be two functions (\u03c6, \u03c7) defined by\nk = e\u22122\u03c6 sec 2\u03c7 d\u03b8 \u2297 d\u03b8 + 2 tan 2\u03c7 sin \u03b8 d\u03b8 \u2297 d\u03c6 + e2\u03c6 sec 2\u03c7 sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c6 \u2297 d\u03c6.\n\n(96)\n\nThen \u03c6 and \u03c7 respectively encode the so-called plus and cross polarizations [25] of the gravitational radiation, referred\nto the quasi-spherical polar coordinates (\u03b8, \u03c6). Straightforward calculations show that the gravitational-radiation\nenergy tensor (43) takes the form\n\u0398\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\n\u2206\u03b1 \u03c6\u2206\u03b2 \u03c6 + \u2206\u03b1 \u03c7\u2206\u03b2 \u03c7 \u2212 21 g\u03b1\u03b2 g \u03b3\u03b4 (\u2206\u03b3 \u03c6\u2206\u03b4 \u03c6 + \u2206\u03b3 \u03c7\u2206\u03b4 \u03c7)\n.\n4\u03c0 cos2 2\u03c7\n\n(97)\n\nThis is an energy tensor for two coupled scalar fields (\u03c6, \u03c7), in particular reducing to the Klein-Gordon form for\npurely plus polarization, \u03c7 = 0. These two potentials may be combined into a single complex gravitational-radiation\npotential\n\u03a6 = \u03c6 + i\u03c7.\n\n(98)\n\nThen the energy tensor takes the form\n\u0398\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\n\u2206\u03b1 \u03a6\u2206\u03b2 \u03a6\u0304 \u2212 12 g\u03b1\u03b2 g \u03b3\u03b4 \u2206\u03b3 \u03a6\u2206\u03b4 \u03a6\u0304\n4\u03c0 cosh2 (\u03a6 \u2212 \u03a6\u0304)\n11\n\n(99)\n\n\fwhere the bar denotes the complex conjugate. The overall factor involving the cross polarization \u03a6 \u2212 \u03a6\u0304 indicates\nthat this is not simply the the energy tensor of a complex Klein-Gordon field \u03a6; there is a non-trivial coupling.\nNevertheless, the gravitational radiation has been encoded in a complex potential, acting like a complex scalar field.\nThis is analogous to the gravitational potential in cylindrical symmetry, which also reduces to the Newtonian potential\nin the Newtonian limit [38]. The current case differs in that \u03a6 is a potential for the gravitational radiation only, not\nincluding the quasi-spherical part of the geometry, for which one might instead define a gravitational potential \u2212m/r.\nThe wave equation (95), written explicitly in terms of (\u03c6, \u03c7) by straightforward calculations, becomes\n\u2206+ \u2206\u2212 \u03c6 + r\u22121 (\u2206+ r\u2206\u2212 \u03c6 + \u2206+ \u03c6\u2206\u2212 r) + 2 tan 2\u03c7(\u2206+ \u03c7\u2206\u2212 \u03c6 + \u2206+ \u03c6\u2206\u2212 \u03c7) = 0\n\u2206+ \u2206\u2212 \u03c7 + r\u22121 (\u2206+ r\u2206\u2212 \u03c7 + \u2206+ \u03c7\u2206\u2212 r) + 2 tan 2\u03c7(\u2206+ \u03c7\u2206\u2212 \u03c7 \u2212 \u2206+ \u03c6\u2206\u2212 \u03c6) = 0.\n\n(100)\n(101)\n\nWritten covariantly in terms of \u03a6 and the quasi-spherical wave operator\n\u2737 = \u22062 + 2r\u22121 \u2206r * \u2206\u266f\n\n(102)\n\n\u2737\u03a6 = 2 tanh(\u03a6 \u2212 \u03a6\u0304)\u2206\u03a6 * \u2206\u266f \u03a6.\n\n(103)\n\nthis becomes\n\nThis complex wave equation encodes the gravitational-wave dynamics. For purely plus polarization, \u03a6 real, the\nright-hand side vanishes and the equation is a linear wave equation, with the same form as the wave equation\n\u22072 \u03c6 = 0 in spherical symmetry. Otherwise, the cross polarization enters the equation and consequently affects the\nwave propagation. This polarization-coupling effect is quadratic in \u2206\u03a6 and so will be small for weak waves, thereby\nagreeing with linearized gravitational-wave theory. It should perhaps be stressed that, while the gravitational-radiation\npotential \u03a6 depends on all four space-time coordinates, the wave equation (103) is an effectively two-dimensional\nequation, describing wave propagation independently at each angle of the sphere. Similarly, while the wavefronts are\nroughly spherical, the waves themselves need not be; their amplitude is independent at each angle of the sphere.\nRemarkably, the wave equation (103) is a type of Ernst equation, originally discovered in the quite different context\nof stationary axisymmetric space-times, with 2\u03a6 being what Ernst denoted by \u03bc [44]. Ernst introduced other potentials\nmore commonly denoted [13,45,46] by\nZ = e2\u03a6\n\n(104)\n\nE = tanh \u03a6\n\n(105)\n\nand\n\nin terms of which the wave equation (103) becomes\n(Z + Z\u0304)\u2737Z = 2\u2206Z * \u2206\u266f Z\n\n(106)\n\n(E \u0112 \u2212 1)\u2737E = 2\u0112\u2206E * \u2206\u266f E.\n\n(107)\n\nor\n\nThe Ernst equation has been extensively studied both in stationary axisymmetry [13] and in plane symmetry [46],\nso existing methods can be used to analyse the gravitational-wave dynamics. The current case is more complex in\nthat r is generally a function of all four space-time coordinates and is not known independently of \u03a6 in the second\napproximation. However, in the first approximation, say on a Schwarzschild black-hole background, the equation\ncan be treated by existing analytical methods. In particular, a direct comparison with linearized gravitational waves\nshould yield insight into the non-linear effects. This at least demonstrates that, even in the very simplest case, the\napproximation is not some disguised version of linearized theory. In summary, the master gravitational-wave equation\n(103) describes generally non-linear gravitational-wave propagation in physical circumstances where the wavefronts\nare roughly spherical.\nIX. CONFORMAL FIELDS: LOCALIZED BONDI FLUX, STRAIN\n\nIn order to compare with observation, one needs to examine the gravitational radiation at large distances in an\nalmost flat background, classically described by Bondi-Penrose asymptotic theory [14\u201320]. This is straightforward in\nterms of the quasi-spherical conformal factor\n12\n\n\f\u03a9 = r\u22121 .\n\n(108)\n\nThen \u03a9 = 0 defines conformal boundaries of the space-time, including future null infinity I+ and past null infinity\nI\u2212 for an asymptotically flat space-time. Then the conformally rescaled expansions and shears\n\u03b8\u00b1 = \u03a9\u22121 \u03b8\u00b1\n\u03c2\u00b1 = \u03a9\u03c3\u00b1\n\n(109)\n(110)\n\nare finite and generally non-zero at I\u2213 . Rewriting the truncated field equations (33)\u2013(39) of the second approximation\nyields, taking the vacuum case,\n\u2206\u00b1 \u03a9 = \u2212 21 \u03a92 \u03b8\u00b1\n\u2206\u00b1 f = \u03bd\u00b1\n\u2206\u00b1 k = \u03a9\u03c2\u00b1\n\u2206\u00b1 \u03b8\u00b1 = \u2212\u03bd\u00b1 \u03b8\u00b1 \u2212 41 \u03a9||\u03c2\u00b1 ||2\n\n\u2206\u00b1 \u03b8\u2213 = \u2212\u03a9( 21 \u03b8+ \u03b8\u2212 + e\u2212f )\n\u2206\u00b1 \u03bd\u2213 =\n\n\u2206\u00b1 \u03c2\u2213 =\n\n\u2212\u03a92 ( 12 \u03b8+ \u03b8\u2212 + e\u2212f \u2212 41 h\u03c2+ , \u03c2\u2212 i)\n\u03a9(\u03c2+ * k \u22121 * \u03c2\u2212 \u2212 21 \u03b8\u2213 \u03c2\u00b1 ).\n\n(111)\n(112)\n(113)\n(114)\n(115)\n(116)\n(117)\n\nThese conformal field equations are more practically suited to obtaining the gravitational waveforms at large distances,\nand are those which have been numerically implemented [28]. Similarly, the energy flux \u03c8 (74) may be rescaled to\nyield a quantity which is generally non-zero at I\u00b1 , the conformal flux\n\u03c6 = \u03a9\u22122 \u03c8.\n\n(118)\n\nFor the gravitational-radiation energy flux, the explicit expressions\n\u03c6\u00b1 [\u0398] = \u2212\n\nef \u03b8\u2213 ||\u03c2\u00b1 ||2\n64\u03c0\n\n(119)\n\nhave the same form as those for the Bondi flux at I\u2213 [37]. Thus the Bondi flux has been localized. The unified first\nlaw (72), projected along I+ , thereby reduces to a Bondi energy-loss equation. The entire preceding theory may be\nreformulated straightforwardly in terms of such conformal fields. The companion article [29] illustrates this by using\nthe conformal fields, whereas this article generally uses the more familiar physical fields, such as radius r.\nThe physically observable quantity to be measured by a gravitational-wave detector is the strain tensor \u01eb, which\ndetermines the displacements\n\u03b4l\n= \u01eb(e, e)\nl\n\n(120)\n\nwhere, in Newtonian theory, e is a Cartesian basis vector in the direction of displacement. In Einstein theory, the\ndisplacements for a transverse vector e are given by\nh(e, e) + \u03b4h(e, e)\n(l + \u03b4l)2\n.\n=\nh(e, e)\nl2\n\n(121)\n\nAs a transverse surface approaches a metric sphere at I\u00b1 , \u03b4\u03a9/\u03a9 \u2192 0 and k(e, e) \u2192 1, so the formula yields\nl\n\u03b4k(e, e) \u2192 2.\n\u03b4l\nThis leads to the identification of \u01eb with \u03b4k/2, or more precisely with\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\n\u22a5L\u03b1 k d\u03c4 =\n\u03a9(a+ \u03c2+ + a\u2212 \u03c2\u2212 )d\u03c4\n2 \u03b3\n2 \u03b3\n\n(122)\n\n(123)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is a worldline normal to the transverse surfaces and \u03b1 = \u2202/\u2202\u03c4 = a+ l+ + a\u2212 l\u2212 is a vector tangent to \u03b3. Since\nthe strain itself vanishes at I\u00b1 , it is more practical to introduce a quantity which is finite at future null infinity I+ ,\nthe conformal strain tensor\n13\n\n\f\u03b5=\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u03c2\u2212 dx\u2212\n\n(124)\n\n\u03b5\nr\n\n(125)\n\n\u03b3\n\nwhere \u03b3 is now a null curve of constant (x+ , \u03b8, \u03c6). Then\n\u01eb=\n\nis the strain tensor at a large distance r from the source. Thus the variables of the quasi-spherical approximation\nare directly related to the observable strain. There is no need to match with another far-zone approximation, such\nas a linearized approximation. For instance, graphs of the strain waveforms, \u03b5 against x\u2212 at a given angle (\u03b8, \u03c6), are\nproduced as output by the existing numerical codes [28].\nA familiar asymptotic relation between strain and energy density is recovered:\nthe energy density of outgoing\n\u221a\ngravitational radiation (\u03c2+ = 0) near I+ is, taking the normalization a\u00b1 = 1/ 2,\n\u0398(\u03b1, \u03b1) =\n\n||\u2206\u2212 \u01eb||2\n16\u03c0\n\n(126)\n\nwhere one should remember that the two independent components of \u01eb each contribute twice in the norm. Regarding\nconventions, an unfortunate relic of linearized theory is a definition of amplitude of a gravitational wave as that\nof the relevant component of the transverse traceless metric perturbation [25], which would correspond here to k.\nAs above, this differs by a factor of two from the strain amplitude, which is a much more natural definition of\ngravitational-radiation amplitude, being the observable quantity. This is also simply related to the amplitude of the\ngravitational-radiation potential \u03a6 by\n\u0398(\u03b1, \u03b1) =\n\n\u2206\u2212 \u03a6\u2206\u2212 \u03a6\u0304\n8\u03c0 cosh2 (\u03a6 \u2212 \u03a6\u0304)\n\n(127)\n\nand is equal for purely plus polarization, \u03a6 = \u03a6\u0304, as for Einstein-Rosen gravitational waves [38]. Another reason for\nthe latter convention is that the energy density has the same form and numerical factor, (amplitude \u00d7 frequency)2 /8\u03c0,\nas an electromagnetic wave in natural units.\nX. CONCLUSION\n\nThis article has described an astrophysically realistic approximation scheme in which both gravitational radiation\nand black holes are locally defined, along with their physical attributes, with each dynamically influencing the other.\nThe approximation holds where the gravitational wavefronts and black hole (or other astrophysical object) are roughly\nspherical. For black holes, this is an extension of the general theory of black-hole dynamics [30\u201332] and its previous\nformulations in spherical [33] and cylindrical symmetry [38]. In particular, local definitions of gravitational massenergy m (58) and surface gravity \u03ba (70) have been given, satisfying zeroth, first (94) and second (87) laws of\nblack-hole dynamics. For gravitational radiation, this is a new kind of approximation, quite different from the\ncommonly used asymptotic and high-frequency (or merely linearized) approximations. Most crucially, gravitational\nradiation is localized in this approximation, something which is usually argued to be impossible in general and in other\nexisting approximations, unless one counts symmetric space-times [38]. The general non-localizability of gravitational\nwaves has long been an obstacle to understanding the physics of their most interesting, dynamic, strong-gravity\nsources. Remarkably, in the quasi-spherical approximation, the gravitational-wave dynamics is described simply by\nan effectively two-dimensional wave equation (103). This analytically tractable Ernst equation can be used to study\nnon-linear wave-propagation effects, for instance close to a black hole.\nA local energy tensor \u0398 (43) for the gravitational radiation has been defined, taking a scalar-field form in terms of\na complex gravitational-radiation potential (98). Including \u0398 like a matter energy tensor in the truncated Einstein\nequations thereby describes gravitational radiation reaction, the back-reaction of the radiation on the space-time, e.g.\non the black hole producing it. A reliability test is provided by comparing this second approximation with the first\napproximation [27], in which radiation reaction is not included and the radiation propagates on a background. In the\nsecond approximation, the gravitational-radiation energy tensor \u0398 enters a covariant conservation law, conservation\nof energy (83). Specifically, with respect to a canonical flow of time, the combined energy-momentum of the matter\nand gravitational radiation is a Noether current, with the Noether charge being the mass-energy m. The energy\nconservation law can be expressed as a local first law (72) equating changes in m to work and energy-supply terms,\nincluding the energy flux (74) of the gravitational radiation. This unified first law includes both the first law of\nblack-hole dynamics and a Bondi energy-loss equation.\n14\n\n\fIt may be useful to summarize here how the Einstein equation has been simplified and physically understood. Of the\nten components of the full Einstein equation, four components of the truncated equations appear to involve angular\nmomentum but are irrelevant to the radiation problem. Two of the remaining components constitute the wave equation\n(103) describing the propagation of the gravitational radiation. The remaining four components are the quasi-spherical\nequations, of which one is an integrability condition for the others, at least in vacuo and for some matter fields, such\nas a Klein-Gordon field. Of these, one is a relativistic version of Newton's inverse-square law of gravitation, (91),\nand two are equivalent, up to an integration constant, to the first law (72). Thus a comprehensive physical picture\nhas emerged: the Einstein equation has been essentially reduced to a quasi-Newtonian law of gravitation, energy\nconservation and a propagation equation for gravitational radiation.\nAs an example of current interest to many researchers, the approximation can be used to describe gravitational\nradiation from a roughly spherical but dynamically evolving black hole formed by binary black-hole coalescence. The\ndistorted black hole emits gravitational radiation, absorbs backscattered radiation, thereby increases in area and\ntraps some outgoing radiation, changes shape accordingly and consequently emits more radiation, and so on. This\nongoing dynamical process may now be described in a local way by physically interpretable equations, involving\nphysical quantities such as black-hole mass and surface gravity and gravitational-radiation energy flux. Apart from\nsuch practical applications to gravitational-wave astronomy, this provides a rich arena in which to advance physical\nunderstanding of both gravitational radiation and black holes, and the dynamical interaction between them.\nAcknowledgements.
