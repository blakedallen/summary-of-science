Let Mat(n, K) be the algebra of n-dimensional matrices over\nthe field K of real (K = R) or complex (K = C) numbers. A matrix P \u2208\nMat(n, K) is said to be invertible if there exists the matrix P \u22121 \u2208 Mat(n, K)\nsuch that P P \u22121 = P \u22121 P = 1, where 1 is the identity n\u00d7n-matrix. A number\n(scalar) \u03bb \u2208 C is called an eigenvalue of a matrix P \u2208 Mat(n, K) if the matrix\nP \u2212\u03bb1 is not invertible. The full set of eigenvalues of a matrix P is called the\nspectrum of this matrix. The determinant of a matrix det : Mat(n, K) \u2192 K\nis a standard notion of the linear algebra. The determinant has the following\nproperties:\n\u2022 det(P Q) = det(P )det(Q), P, Q \u2208 Mat(n, K);\n\u2022 det(\u03b1P ) = \u03b1n det(P ), \u03b1 \u2208 K, P \u2208 Mat(n, K);\n1\n\n\f\u2022 det(1) = 1;\n\u2022 A matrix P \u2208 Mat(n, K) is invertible iff det(P ) 6= 0.\nIt follows from the last property that all eigenvalues \u03bb of a matrix P\nsatisfy the equation\ndet(P \u2212 \u03bb1) = 0.\nBy P \u2020 denote the Hermitian conjugated matrix (transposed matrix with\ncomplex conjugated components). If P \u2020 = P , then the matrix P is called\nHermitian. The operation of Hermitian conjugation of matrices has the following properties:\n\u2022 (P Q)\u2020 = Q\u2020 P \u2020 ;\n\u2022 P \u2020\u2020 = P ;\n\u2022 The spectrum of a Hermitian matrix is real.\nThe last property means that for any Hermitian matrix P the equation\ndet(P \u2212 \u03bb1) = 0 has only real roots \u03bb. In what follows we show how the\nmatrix algebra notions of determinant, spectrum, and Hermitian conjugation\ntransfer to the Clifford algebra ClK\np,q .\nA Clifford algebra.

By definition, put\nDet(U) = det(U ).\nThe proofs of the theorems A1,A2,A3 are by direct calculation.\nTheorem A1. The determinant of U \u2208 ClK\np,q satisfy the following formulas:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\n\u03a9U\nDet(U) = \u03a9\u223c\nU \u03a9U\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n2\nTr(\u03a9\u223c\nU \u03a9U ) \u2212 2det(\u03b7)(Tr(l\u03a9U ))\n\nfor n = 1, 2;\nfor n = 3;\nfor n = 4,\n\nwhere \u03a9U = U \u2227 U \u223c and l = e1234 . It is easy to check that \u03a9U is a scalar for\nn = 1, 2 and \u03a9\u223c\nU \u03a9U is a scalar for n = 3.\nTheorem A2. The determinant of Clifford algebra elements has the properties\n\u2022 Det(UV ) = Det(U)Det(V ) for U, V \u2208 ClK\np,q ;\n\u2022 Det(\u03b2U) = \u03b2 k(n) Det(U), where \u03b2 \u2208 K, U \u2208 ClK\np,q and k(n) = 2 for\nn = 1, 2 and k(n) = 4 for n = 3, 4;\n\u2022 Det(1) = 1;\n\u2022 An element U \u2208 ClK\np,q is invertible iff Det(U) 6= 0.\n\n5\n\n\fIf scalar \u03bb \u2208 C satisfy the equation Det(U \u2212 \u03bb) = 0, then we say that \u03bb is\nan eigenvalue of the element U \u2208 ClK\np,q . The full set of eigenvalues of a Clifford\nalgebra element U is called the spectrum of this element. The spectrum of\na Clifford algebra element consists of two scalars {\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 } in cases n = 1, 2\nand consists of four scalars {\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb4 } in cases n = 3, 4 (with regard to\nmultiplicity).\nA Hermitian conjugation of Clifford algebra elements.

Therefore using matrix representations we introduce notions\nof determinant, spectrum, and Hermitian conjugation of Clifford algebra elements. In theorems A1,A3 we establish formulas for determinant and for\nHermitian conjugation in terms of intrinsic Clifford algebra operations. Now\n\n6\n\n\fwe may define the determinant and the Hermitian conjugation of Clifford algebra elements using formulas of theorems A1,A3 without reference to matrix\nrepresentations.\nDefinition 1. The determinant of a Clifford algebra element U \u2208 ClK\np,q is the\nscalar Det(U) \u2208 K from the formula in Theorem A1.\nDefinition 2. The operation of Hermitian conjugation of a Clifford algebra\nK\nelement \u2020 : ClK\np,q \u2192 Clp,q is the operation defined by the formula in Theorem\nA3.\nIn [1] we discuss a four dimensional parallelisable manifold W with the\ntetrad 1-forms ea , a = 0, 1, 2, 3. These 1-forms can be considered as generators of the Clifford algebra Cl1,3 and differential forms on W can be considered\nas elements of the Clifford algebra Cl1,3 with respect to the Clifford product\nof differential forms [1]. This implies that the discussed Clifford algebra notions of determinant, spectrum, and Hermitian conjugation are applicable to\ndifferential forms on parallelisable manifolds.\n\nReferences\n[1] Marchuk N.G., A concept of Dirac-type tensor equations, Nuovo Cimento, 117B, 12, (2002), pp.1357-1388.\n\n7\n\n\f"}
