Incomplete-since we get these results only in the WKB approximation and\nonly for a special class of contours. The ways to go beyond these limitations and in particular\nthe OPE for operators defined on the loop are also discussed.\n\nFebruary 2000\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nGauge fields \u2013 strings duality is an old and fundamental subject. It underwent a rapid and\nfascinating development in the last three years. In this duality color-electric flux lines of gauge\ntheory are described as certain relativistic strings. It has been shown in [1] that the \"natural\nhabitat\" for these strings (and thus for the flux lines) is a five-dimensional curved space with\nthe metric\nds2 = d\u03c62 + a2 (\u03c6) d~x 2 .\n\n(1.1)\n\nThe function a2 (\u03c6) (which represents the running string tension) must be of a special type.\nIn order to properly describe the zigzag-invariant Wilson loop, it must have a horizon, where\na2 (\u03c6H ) = 0, and an infinity where a2 (\u03c6I ) = \u221e. The precise form of a2 (\u03c6) is determined from\nthe condition of conformal invariance on the world sheet. The gauge fields \u2013 strings duality was\nformulated in [1] as an isomorphism between the closed string vertex operators and the gauge\ninvariant operators of gauge theory.\nAnother development [2] was related to the N = 4 SYM theory and the 3-branes in the type\nIIB strings. It has been shown there that some of the SYM correlation functions (describing\nabsorption of the external particles by the 3-brane) can be calculated by the use of the classical\nsupergravity in which the 3-brane is replaced by the metric (1.1). It was further conjectured\n[3] that the correspondence extends beyond the SUGRA approximation and the function a2 (\u03c6)\nin this case must correspond to the AdS space (a2 (\u03c6) \u221d e\u03b1\u03c6 ).\nIn the subsequent papers [4], [5] it was shown how to implement the above-mentioned isomorphism in the N = 4 SYM theory. After that the correspondence in this case has been\nconfirmed in an almost infinite number of papers.\nBut all is not well. There is no real understanding (beyond the heuristic arguments of [1]-[5])\nwhy and, more importantly, when the correspondence works. Ideally, one would like to check\nthat the Schwinger-Dyson equations of the Yang-Mills theory can be obtained from the string\nrepresentation. This would clarify which string theories must be used for the various gauge\ntheories. It is important to stress in this respect that the help of the D-branes in answering the\nabove question is not always available. There are reasons to believe that in the most interesting\nnon-supersymmetric cases the D-brane interpretation of the general \u03c3-model metric (1.1) is not\n2\n\n\fpossible. In these cases the Schwinger-Dyson equations (formulated as loop equations) is our\nonly tool.\nIn the vast literature on the subject there have been occasional attempts to explore the loop\nequations, but no conclusive results have been reached so far.\nThe reason, we believe, lies in some common misconceptions concerning loop equations. It is\ngenerally thought that the loop operator is singular and can be applied only to the regularized\nand non-universal Wilson loop. This is not necessarily so. In [6] it has already been sketched\nhow to implement the loop equation for the renormalized loops.\nIn the present paper we shall apply the loop operator to the string functional integral.\nThe results are incomplete but quite stunning. We will be dealing only with the very special\ncontours-wavy lines (suggested in [1]) and only in the WKB approximation. This is obviously\nincomplete. We will find in this case that, first, the loop operator is well defined in any\ndimension (implying the zigzag symmetry of the string representation), and second, at the\ncritical dimension Dcr = 4 the loop equation is satisfied. This we find quite stunning.\n\n2\n\nThe loop equation and the zigzag symmetry\n\nThe loop equation has been introduced in [7] and further explored in [6] and [8] (see also some\nrelated developments in [9], [10]). We will give its derivation now, which can be used for the\nrenormalized Wilson loop. It will contain some additional elements to the old works. The\nWilson loop is given by\n1\nW [C] =\nN\n\n\u001d\n\u001c\nI\n\u03bc\n.\nTrP exp A\u03bc dx\n\n(2.1)\n\nC\n\nThe averaging in this formula is performed with the Yang-Mills action\nZ\n1\n2\nS= 2\nTrF\u03bc\u03bd\n(dx)\n4gY M\n(F\u03bc\u03bd is the Yang-Mills field strength). The idea of the loop equation is to find an operation in\nthe loop space which, being applied to the LHS of (2.1), will give the Yang-Mills equations of\n\n3\n\n\fmotion at the RHS. To implement this idea, consider the second variational derivative of W [C]\n\u0011E\nD\n\u0010\nH\n\u03b42W\nA\u03bc dx\u03bc\n\u1e8b\u03bd (s)\u03b4(s \u2212 s\u2032 )+\n=\nTr\nP\n\u2207\nF\n(x(s))e\n\u03bc \u03bc\u03bd\n\u2032\n\u03b4x\u03bc (s)\u03b4x\u03bc (s )\n\u0011E\nD\n\u0010\nH\n\u2032\nA\u03bc dx\u03bc\n\u1e8b\u03bb (s)\u1e8b\u03c3 (s\u2032 )\nTr P F\u03bc\u03bb (x(s))F\u03bc\u03c3 (x(s ))e\n\n(2.2)\n\n(where P is the ordering along the contour).\nThe main idea of the loop equation is to separate the first term, and to introduce the\n\"loop Laplacian\" which acting on W [C] gives the Yang-Mills equation of motion. This can be\nachieved in several different ways. The problem to overcome is the singularity of the second\nterm at s = s\u2032 , which makes it difficult to distinguish it from the first one.\nThe \"brute force\" method would be to regularize the gauge theory with some cut-off \u039b\nand the consider |s \u2212 s\u2032 | \u226a 1/\u039b. The second term is regular in this case, while the first one\ncontains the \u03b4-function which is easy to pick up. The price to pay is the non-universal arbitrary\nregularization. We cannot be sure that on the string side the regularization is the same and\nthus the comparison of gauge fields and strings becomes strictly speaking impossible. It has\nalready been noticed in [6] that the way out of this difficult is to use the operator product\nexpansion as s \u2192 s\u2032 .\nConsider a set of operators {On (x)} which are not color singlets. We can in general examine\na gauge invariant amplitude\nD\n\n\u0010\n\nH\n\nGn1 ...nN (s1 , . . . sN ) = TrP On1 (x(s1 ))On2 (x(s2 )) . . . e\n\nC\n\nA\u03bc dx\u03bc\n\n\u0011E\n\n.\n\nLet us assume that the contour C is smooth and non-selfintersecting. In this case we expect\nthe OPE to have the form1\nOn1 (x(s1 ))On2 (x(s2 )) =\n(where s =\n\ns1 +s2\n2\n\nX\n\nCnm1 n2 (x(s))\n|x(s1 ) \u2212 x(s2 )|\u2206n1 +\u2206n2 \u2212\u2206m\n\nOm (x(s))\n\n(2.3)\n\nand \u2206n are anomalous dimensions of the corresponding operators). Of course,\n\nin asymptotically free theories there are also powers of logarithms log |x(s1 ) \u2212 x(s2 )| in these\nformulas, which we do not display.\nIn this way the OPE in the physical 4d space is transplanted to the one-dimensional contour\nC. The \"open string\" amplitudes Gn1 ...nN (s1 , . . . sN ) have power singularities at the coinciding\n1\n\nSuch operator products were considered before in [16].\n\n4\n\n\fpoints. There is no room for the contact terms proportional to \u03b4(s \u2212 s\u2032 ) if we use renormalized\ncorrelators. Moreover, the possible contact terms in the x-space do not give contact terms in\nthe s-space. Consider as an example a singularity\n\u03b4(x(s) \u2212 x(s\u2032 )) = lim (4 \u2212 \u2206)\n\u2206\u21924\n\n1\n.\n|x(s) \u2212 x(s\u2032 )|\u2206\n\nAs it was explained in [6], when one uses test functions,\nZ\nZ\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03b4(x(s) \u2212 x(s )) f (s ) ds = lim (4 \u2212 \u2206)\n\u2206\u21924\n\nf (s\u2032) ds\u2032\n=0,\n|x(s) \u2212 x(s\u2032 )|\u2206\n\nprovided that the contour has no self-intersections, so that the only singularity in the integral\ncomes from s = s\u2032 . It is also assumed that the integral is defined by analytic continuation.\nAs a result of this discussion we conclude that the second variational derivative of the\nrenormalized (and analytically regularized) Wilson loop has the form\nX Cn (s, {x(s)})\n\u03b42W\n\u2032\nb\n,\n=\n(\nL(s)W\n)\u03b4(s\n\u2212\ns\n)\n+\n\u03b4x\u03bc (s)\u03b4x\u03bc (s\u2032 )\n|x(s) \u2212 x(s\u2032 )|4\u2212\u2206n\nn\nH\n\nwhere Cn (s, {x(s)}) \u221d TrP On (x(s))e\n\nA dx\n\n\u0001\n\n. Since |x(s) \u2212 x(s\u2032 )| \u2248\n\n(2.4)\n\np\n\u1e8b2 (s)|s \u2212 s\u2032 |, the\n\nnonlocal power-like behavior of the second term for s \u2192 s\u2032 can be separated from the local\nb\ns = s\u2032 singularity of the first one. The loop Laplacian is defined as the coefficient L(s)W\nin\nfront of the \u03b4-function, and the loop equation for non-selfintersecting contours has the form\nb\nL(s)W\n=0.\n\n(2.5)\n\nIn our applications it will be convenient to write (2.4) in the momentum space:\nlim\n\np\u2192\u221e\n\n\u03b4x\u03bc\n\nq\n2\n\n\u03b42W\n\u0001\n+ p \u03b4x\u03bc\n\nq\n2\n\n\u2212p\n\nbq W )p0 +\n\u0001 = (L\n\nX\n\nCn (q)|p|\u03bbn .\n\n(2.6)\n\nn\n\nThis is an important formula. It shows that the Wilson loop belongs to a very special class\nof functionals, for which the asymptotics in (2.6) does not contain integer even powers of p,\ncorresponding to the derivatives of the \u03b4-function. If it does, this means that the functional\nW [C] cannot be represented as an ordered exponential (2.1).\nSome danger for this analysis would be presented by odd integers \u2206n in (2.4), which would\ngive a pk (log p + const) contribution. However, the lowest operators which can appear in (2.3),\n\n5\n\n\feven when protected by non-renormalization theorem, have even dimensions. An exception\nfrom this is the operator \u2207\u03b1 F\u03b2\u03b3 which can appear in the OPE:\nF\u03bc\u03bb (x(s))F\u03bc\u03c3 (x(s\u2032 )) \u223c\n\n(x(s) \u2212 x(s\u2032 ))\u03bc \u2207\u03bc F\u03bb\u03c3\n.\n|x(s) \u2212 x(s\u2032 )|2\n\n(We assume here the scenario in which the F\u03bc\u03bd operator has the normal dimension as a result\nof some non-renormalization theorem.) However, the singular contribution from this term to\n(2.2) vanishes after contraction with \u1e8b\u03bb (s)\u1e8b\u03c3 (s\u2032 ).\nThe above analysis can be extended to the functionals represented by the iterated integrals\nXZ\nW [C] =\n\u0393(n)\n(2.7)\n\u03bc1 ...\u03bcn (x(s1 ), . . . x(sn )) \u1e8b\u03bc1 (s1 ) . . . \u1e8b\u03bcn (sn ) ds1 . . . dsn\nn\n\ns1 <s2 ...<sn\n\n(of which (2.1) is a special case). Such functionals behave well under the application of the\nloop Laplacian (see [8]). Hence, the second variational derivative for them has the structure\n(2.6).\nAnother feature of the functionals (2.7) is the zigzag symmetry [1]. When we change s \u21d2\n\n\u03b1(s), they are invariant even if \u03b1\u2032 (s) changes sign (and is not a diffeomorphism). It is likely\n\nthat any zigzag-invariant functional can be represented in the form (2.7), if it satisfies some\nextra analyticity requirements. Without them many other forms are possible, e.g.\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n\u1e8d\u03b1 \u1e8b\u03b2 \u2212 \u1e8d\u03b2 \u1e8b\u03b1\n.\nI\u03b1\u03b2 = ds\n\u1e8b2\nAt present the precise form of these requirements is not known, although a possibility is that\nthe functional must be nonsingular with respect to \u1e8b2 . In the following, we will use the term\n\"zigzag symmetry\" referring to the form (2.7). According to the above discussion, there is a\npractical way for testing the zigzag symmetry in this sense: take the asymptotics (2.6) and\ncheck for the terms \u221d pn with n-positive even integer. If they are present, there is no place\nfor the zigzag symmetry, and the functional does not represent any Yang-Mills theory. This\nconclusion, together with the formula (2.6), will be extensively used below.\n\n3\n\nThe string representation: D-branes and/or \u03c3-model.\n\nLet us summarize the facts about string representation of the Wilson loop. According to [1]\nwe must consider a 5d background with the metric (1.1). The origin of the fifth dimension is\n6\n\n\fthe Liouville degree of freedom which is unavoidable in the non-critical strings. The \u03c3-model\naction of this string is given by\nZ\n\u221a\n1\n\u221a\nd2 \u03be gg ab (\u03be)GM N (z(\u03be))\u2202a z M \u2202b z N + \u03a6(z(\u03be)) (2)R(g) g\nS =\n2\n+ \u01ebab BM N (z(\u03be))\u2202a z M \u2202b z N + other background fields + fermions.\n\n(3.1)\n\nWe introduced the 5d variable z M = (x\u03bc , y). We are also considering a fermionic non-critical\nstring. The metric GM N has the form obtained by the obvious change of variables in (1.1):\nds2 = \u03c1(y)(dy 2 + d~x 2 ) .\n\n(3.2)\n\nAs usual, the background fields are determined from the \u03b2-function equation [11], expressing\nthe g ab -independence of the theory.\nIt is important to have the NSR fermions for the gauge fields \u2013 strings duality. It is also\nnecessary to perform the non-chiral GSO-projection in the functional integral. The whole\nmatter has been treated in the paper [12]. Here we will just remind the reader the underlying\nlogic with a few additional comments.\nThere are two types of objects we would like to consider. First, there are the closed strings\namplitudes. We introduce the closed string vertex operators, e.g.\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\nV\u03bc\u03bd = d2 \u03be \u03c8p~ (y(\u03be))\u2202ax\u03bc \u2202a x\u03bd ei~p ~x(\u03be)\nand claim that for the proper choice of the metric \u03c1(y) the correlators of V 's on the string side\nare equal to the correlators of the gauge invariant operators on the Yang-Mills side. In other\nwords, we conjecture an isomorphism\nClosed string\nstates\n\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\nGauge invariant\noperators.\n\n(3.3)\n\n2\ncan be\nThe intuitive reason for this conjecture is that gauge invariant operators like TrF\u03bc\u03bd\n\nassociated with tiny closed flux lines, represented by small Wilson loops. Indeed, we create a\nflux line by acting on the vacuum with the operator\nI\nTrP exp A dx \u2248 I + C\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c3 Tr(F\u03bc\u03bd F\u03bb\u03c3 ) + . . .\nC\u21920\n\nC\n\n7\n\n\fThe propagation of these loops forms the closed world surfaces with punctures represented\nby the vertex operators. This means that if we find the right action (3.1), the closed string\nS-matrix will be equal to the correlation functions of the local gauge invariant operators.\nBut how to discover the right action? This question does not have a complete answer\nat present. There are two approaches the problem. One approach [2], [3], applicable to the\nsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theories, is to start with the 3-branes of the Type IIB superstring.\nThen, on the one hand, it is known that the low energy excitation of the stack of N three-branes\nare described by the supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with the SU(N) gauge group. On the\nother hand, 3-branes can be presumably replaced by the supergravity background the generate,\nand thus one expects and checks the isomorphism (3.3).\nThe main problem with this approach is that it is far from being clear that non-supersymmetric\ntheories can be described in the D-brane language. Also, even in the supersymmetric case, so far\nthere is no real derivation of the isomorphism (3.3) from the first principles, although numerous\nchecks have been performed.\nAnother approach [1] is to try to formulate the conditions under which the \u03c3-model satisfies\nthe Schwinger-Dyson equations of the Yang-Mills theory. The basic object in this approach is\nthe Wilson loop, defined by\nW [~x(s)] =\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\nZ\n\nDy(\u03be)D~x(\u03be)e\u2212S[~x(\u03be),y(\u03be)] .\n\n~x|\u2202D = ~x(s)\ny|\u2202D =?\n\nHere we take the world sheet with a disc topology (appropriate for large N). At the boundary\nof the disc we fixed ~x by the condition ~x|\u2202D = ~x(s). Now, we have to determine y|\u2202D and the\nbackground fields so that the loop equations are satisfied. The basic idea of [1] was to notice\nthat the metric \u03c1(y) must have horizon and/or infinity points, so that\n\u03c1(yH ) = 0 and \u03c1(yI ) = \u221e .\nThese are the only positions where we can place the contour. Indeed, if we choose some other\ny|\u2202D , we will encounter the lack of the zigzag symmetry coming from the fact that the first\n\u221a\nterm in (7) is (due to the presence of g) invariant only under diffeomorphisms, but not under\nthe zigzag transformations. Hence it must be either zero or infinite at the boundary. A more\n8\n\n\fprecise condition was given in [12]. It was stated there that in order to describe gauge theory\nwe must find the metric \u03c1(y), the other background fields, and the boundary conditions y|\u2202D\nsuch that the vector vertex operators, defined at the boundary, form a closed algebra. Physically\nthis means that open strings in this theory correspond to vector gluons. Also, the vector vertex\noperators are selected by the zigzag symmetry, since they are the only ones defined without the\nworld sheet metric.\nWhen the D-brane description is applicable, the above condition is satisfied. But it is\nimportant that the condition be formulated without any reference to D-branes.\nIn the case of the N = 4 SYM the D-branes and conformal symmetry considerations lead\nto the formula [3]\n\u03c1(y) =\n\nq\n\ngY2 M N *\n\n1\n.\ny2\n\n(3.4)\n\nIt has been shown in [4], [5] for the local operators and in [13], [14] for the loops that the natural\nlocation for the gauge theory quantities is the infinity in this AdS space, that is y \u2192 0.\nIn this paper we shall adopt this prescription, although there is no real proof for it. In a\nsense, our check of the loop equations in this paper can be considered as such (incomplete)\nproof.\nOne should keep in mind, however, that there is another zigzag-symmetric location, y = \u221e.\nThis point has no geometrical significance in the Euclidean signature (the Lobachevsky space)\nbut is meaningful in the Lorentz signature (that is in the AdS space). In the latter case this\npoint represents a horizon behind which the D-branes are hidden. This horizon is physically\nimportant because the absorption by the D-branes can be accounted for as the disappearance\nof the closed strings behind the horizon [2]. It is therefore natural that the Wilson loop C on\nthe D-brane can be represented as a Wilson loop at the horizon [1]. In this case, however, the\nloop generates the B\u03bc\u03bd -field with B\u03bc\u03bd = B\u03bc\u03bd (x, {C}) [1]. At present we do not know how to\ndetermine this field. We hope that the two types of boundary conditions yield the same result\nand will be studying the case y = 0.\nThe string representation involves various background fields. For example, since we need\nNSR fermions to exclude the boundary tachion (violating the zigzag symmetry), we have RR\nfields in our closed string spectrum, and they form a condensate in order to stabilize the AdS\n9\n\n\fspace. The concrete types and forms of background fields depend on the type of the gauge\ntheory we are working with. The problem of finding the precise background in each particular\ncase is not yet completely solved. Of course to check the complete loop equations we have to\nsolve the above problem first. However, in the conformal cases it is possible to retreat to the\nquasiclassical domain by taking gY2 M N \u226b 1. In this case the string action takes the form:\nZ\nq\n\u0001\nd2 \u03be\n1\n2\n2\n2\ngY M N\nS[~x(\u03be), y(\u03be)] =\n(\u2202\n~\nx\n)\n+\n(\u2202\ny)\n+ O(1) ,\n(3.5)\na\na\n2\ny 2 (\u03be)\n\nwhere the terms O(1) contain NSR fermions and RR fields. We arrive at the conclusion that\nin the WKB limit, the Wilson loop is given by [13], [14]\n\u221a2\nW [C] \u221d e\u2212 gY M N *Amin [C] .\n\n(3.6)\n\nHere\n1\nAmin [C] = min\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u0001\nd2 \u03be\n2\n2\n(\u2202\n~\nx\n)\n+\n(\u2202\ny)\na\na\ny2\n\n(3.7)\n\nis the minimal area of a surface bounded by the loop C. In the following sections we will\nanalyze the action of the loop operator on this functional.\n\n4\n\nMinimal area in the Lobachevsky space\n\nOur contour is located at infinity (the absolute) of the Lobachevsky space. There are some\ngeneral features of such minimal areas which we discuss in this section.

In this formula L[C] is the length of the\ncontour C and A[~c(\u03c3)] is a finite functional.\nOur main interest is to derive variational equations for A[C]. One might think that the\nusual Hamilton-Jacobi equations following from the conditions \u03b8\u22a5k = \u03b8\u22a5\u22a5 = 0 will give us a\nclosed equation for A. Unfortunately, life is not so simple. The above would be the case is we\nwere able to find the coefficients ~g and b in terms of ~c. Indeed, it is easy to see that\n~g (\u03c3)\n\u03b4A\n= 2\n\u03b4~c(\u03c3)\na (\u03c3)\n11\n\n\fand if b were known, the equation for A would follow from (4.5).\nThere is an unpleasant surprise, however. Further iterations of (4.1) reveal that the functions\n~g (\u03c3) and b(\u03c3) in (4.3) are not determined by the small \u03c4 -expansion and can be kept arbitrary.\nThey are fixed by the global condition for the absence of singularities at finite \u03c4 , and thus it\nis hard to find them explicitly. Because of this difficulty we will choose an alternative way of\nfinding A[C]. Namely, we will consider a special type of contours-wavy lines, and will develop\na method of successive approximations for A[C]. We will also see another derivation of (4.6).\n\n5\n\nThe theory of wavy lines\n\nIt was already suggested in [1] that it is instructive to consider wavy lines instead of general\ncontours, namely to look at a curve\nx1 (s) = s,\n\nxi (s) = \u03c6i (s),\n\ni = 2, . . . D ,\n\n~\nand to assume that \u03c6i (s) are small. Below we shall find the expansion of A[\u03c6(s)]\nup to the\nfourth order and then explore the action of the loop Laplacian. To perform this expansion it is\nconvenient to consider the standard Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the minimal surface which\nhas the well-known general form:\nGM N (z)\n\ndz M dz N\n\u03b4A\n\u03b4A\n=\nG\n.\nM\nN\n\u03b4z M (s) \u03b4z N (s)\nds ds\n\nFor the Poincar\u00e9 metric this equation becomes\n(\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u00132\n\u0012 \u00132 )\n2\n\u03b4A\ndy\n1\n\u03b4A\nd~x\n.\n+\n= 4\n+\n\u03b4y(s)\n\u03b4~x(s)\ny (s)\nds\nds\n\n(5.1)\n\nWe want to explore the limit y(s) = y \u2192 0.

The second term in (7.4) may be modified if the theory contains a scalar operator of\ndimension 2. That can change the constants C1 and C2 . At the same time, the structure of\nthe first term cannot be modified by anything and provides a strong check for the consistency\nof our approach. Notice that it also predicts that the dimension of F\u03bc\u03bd is not renormalized.\n\n8\n\nConclusions and outlook\n\nThe main efforts of this work were directed towards the development of new techniques for\nchecking the loop equations in string theory. We managed to apply the loop Laplacian to the\n18\n\n\fminimal area in the Lobachevsky space and to show for the first time that the equations of\nmotion of gauge theory are satisfied by string theory, at least in the WKB approximation.\nThis point perhaps requires some clarifications. Namely, we looked at the Wilson loop (2.1) in\nconformal versions of the Yang-Mills theory. These versions unavoidably contain other fields.\nHence we expect that\n\u2207\u03bc F\u03bc\u03bd = J\u03bd 6= 0\n(where J\u03bd is the current generated by those fields). So, what is the meaning of finding that\nb min = 0 at D = 4?\nLA\nThere are several possible interpretations of this fact. Let us begin with the unpleasant one\n\n(in which we do not believe). It may be that our result is just a fluke, while if we proceed to\nhigher orders in \"waviness\" of our contour, the loop equations will not be satisfied. Further\nprogress will be difficult in this case.\nLet us take another, optimistic view. Various gauge theories presumably have a string\nrepresentation with the background (1.1). If the theory is conformal, (1.1) must describe the\nAdS space. What distinguishes various theories is not the metric but other background fields\nand also the field content on the world sheet. However, in the WKB limit gY2 M N \u2192 \u221e the\nasymptotics of the Wilson loop is given by the formula (3.6) and is the same for all conformal\ntheories. If this is the case, it means that the current in the above formula is negligible in the\nWKB limit, and our result actually checks the universal law (3.6). Notice also that we are\nconsidering the standard Wilson loop and not its modified version suggested in [13], [14]. Once\nagain, with the above philosophy this modification is irrelevant in the WKB limit.\nTo verify the above assertions it is necessary to go beyond our wavy line approximation. We\nbelieve that this can be done by a more general treatment of the Hamilton-Jacobi equations.\nConformal invariance of the loop Laplacian (which we discuss in the Appendix) should play\nan important role in this analysis. Alternatively, one can study the second variation of the\nfunctional (3.5) by developing the short distance expansion of the Green functions for equations\n(4.1). It is conceivable that by this method it will be possible to relate OPE on the world sheet\nand OPE in gauge theory.\nThis brings us to a more difficult problem of going beyond WKB approximation. Again, the\nmethod of wavy lines may be useful here, but at the moment we do not know how to evaluate\n19\n\n\fbq on quantum corrections to our formula.\nthe action of L\n\nIn the case of non-conformal theories the metric has the form\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\ndy + d~x 2\n2\nds = f (log y)\ny2\n\nThe problem for our analysis is not so much the function f (it is easy to generalize our considerations to this case) as the absence of the WKB domain. It may be helpful to notice that instead\nof considering non-conformal case in 4d, one can, in the asymptotically free theories, shift to\nbq W \u221d \u01eb\nD = 4 + \u01eb, when these theories become conformal. Perhaps, the classical part of L\n\nwill be canceled by the quantum fluctuations and will provide us with the \"Holy Grail\" of this\nsubject - the space-time \u03b2-function.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to Volodya Kazakov for his participation in the early stages of this project\nas well as for useful discussions. The work of A.P. was partially supported by NSF grant\nPHY-98-02484.\n\nAppendix: Conformal invariance of the loop equation\nThe basic property of the functional A (and hence of W ) is its conformal invariance:\nA[C] = A[f (C)]\n\n(8.1)\n\n(where f is a conformal transformation, say f\u03bc (x) = x\u03bc /x2 ). This is true for any D. Although\nthis invariance is to be expected, it is not entirely obvious, since isometries of the Lobachevsky\nspace (corresponding to conformal transformations on the boundary) will change the cut-off \u01eb in\n(4.6). To check the invariance, we extend f to the (D + 1)-dimensional Lobachevsky isometry:\n\u0013\n\u0012\ny\nx\u03bc\nF\n,\n.\n(8.2)\n(x\u03bc , y) \u2192\nx2 + y 2 x2 + y 2\nConsider the minimal surface M bounded by C. Since F is an isometry, F (M) is the corresponding surface for f (C). Moreover,\nArea[M\u01eb ] = Area[F (M\u01eb )]\n20\n\n(8.3)\n\n\f(where M\u01eb is the surface M cut off at the hight \u01eb). For small \u01eb, the LHS is equal to L[C]/\u01eb+A[C].\nAccording to (8.2), the constant cut-off \u01eb is transformed by F to the variable cut-off \u01eb/x2 . To\ncalculate the RHS of (8.3), it is convenient to introduce an auxiliary constant cut-off \u01eb\u2032 on\nF (M), so that Area[F (M\u01eb )] becomes equal to Area[F (M)\u01eb\u2032 ] plus the area of a narrow strip\nbetween the variable and constant cut-offs. Now (8.3) implies:\nL[C]\nL[f (C)]\n+ A[C] =\n+ A[f (C)] +\n\u2032\n\u01eb,\u01eb \u21920\n\u01eb\n\u01eb\u2032\n\nI\n\ndf (x(s))\nds\nds\n\nC\n\nZ\n\n\u01eb\u2032\n\n\u01eb/x(s)2\n\ndy\n.\ny2\n\nCalculating the integral, we see that the singular terms cancel, and we get (8.1).\nIt is now natural to ask if the loop Laplacian transforms is conformally invariant, i.e. commutes with conformal transformations. This property can be written as the equality\n\u0010\n\u0011\nb\nb\nL(s)U\n[C]\n=\n\u03c1\nL(s)U\n[f (C)]\nf\n\n(8.4)\n\nvalid for any (reparametrization invariant) functional U[C] (where Uf [C] = U[f (C)] is the\nfunctional U transformed by a conformal transformation; \u03c1 is some factor). It turns out that\n(8.4) is true if and only if D = 4. To prove this, consider the relation:\n\u03b42U\n\u03b4U\n\u03b4 2 Uf [x(s)]\n\u2032\n=\n\u2202\nf\n(x(s))\u2202\nf\n(x(s\n))\n+ \u2202 2 f\u03bb (x(s))\n\u03b4(s \u2212 s\u2032 ) .\n\u03bc\n\u03bb\n\u03bc\n\u03c3\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03b4x\u03bc (s)\u03b4x\u03bc (s )\n\u03b4f\u03bb (s)\u03b4f\u03c3 (s )\n\u03b4f\u03bb (s)\nFor conformal transformations we have\n\u2202\u03bc f\u03bb \u2202\u03bc f\u03c3 = \u03c1(f )\u03b4\u03bb\u03c3 .\nNow, we must collect terms proportional to \u03b4(s \u2212 s\u2032 ). This gives\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2032\n\u2032\nb\nb\nL(s)U\nf [C]\u03b4(s \u2212 s ) = \u03c1(f ) L(s)U [f (C)]\u03b4(s \u2212 s )\n+ \u2202 2 f\u03bb\n\n\u03b4U\n\u03b4(s \u2212 s\u2032 ) + \u2202\u03bc f\u03bb (x(s))\u2202\u03bc f\u03c3 (x(s\u2032 ))N[\u03bb\u03c3] \u03b4 \u2032 (s \u2212 s\u2032 ) ,\n\u03b4f\u03bb\n\nwhere N[\u03bb\u03c3] is the coefficient in front of the \u03b4 \u2032 -function in the second variational derivative:\n\u0010 s + s\u2032 \u0011\n\u03b42U\n\u03b4 \u2032 (s \u2212 s\u2032 ) + . . .\n=\nN\n[\u03bb\u03c3]\n\u2032\n\u03b4f\u03bb (s)\u03b4f\u03c3 (s )\n2\nFrom the condition of the reparametrization invariance\n\ndx\u03bb \u03b4U\nds \u03b4x\u03bb (s)\n\n\u03b4U\n= N[\u03bb\u03c3] (s)\u1e8b\u03c3 (s) .\n\u03b4x\u03bb (s)\n21\n\n= 0 we have the identity [6]:\n\n\fThis gives the transformation law\n\u0010\n\u0011\nb\nb\nL(s)Uf [C] = \u03c1(f ) L(s)U [f (C)] + \u03a9[\u03bb\u03c3]\u03bc (f ) N[\u03bb\u03c3] \u1e8b\u03bc (s) ,\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03a9[\u03bb\u03c3]\u03bc = \u2202 2 f[\u03bb \u2202\u03bc f\u03c3] \u2212 \u2202\u03b1 \u2202\u03bc f[\u03bb \u2202\u03b1 f\u03c3] .\n\n(8.5)\n\nSubstituting f\u03bc = x\u03bc /x2 , we find that \u03a9(f ) \u221d (D \u2212 4), and thus (8.4) is true if and only if\nD = 4.\nAs a consequence of the above discussion, for D = 4 the loop equation for the Wilson loop\n(6.1) is conformally invariant:\nb\nb\nL(s)W\n[f (C)] = \u03c1L(s)W\n[C] .\n\n(8.6)\n\nIt follows that in order to check the equation at a point x(s) of a contour C, we are allowed to\nfirst apply a conformal transformation, say with the purpose of simplifying the behavior of the\ncontour at the point we are looking at. Although this observation does not play any significant\nrole when working with wavy lines, it might become important for general contours.\nFor D 6= 4 the presence of nonzero additional term in the RHS of the transformation law\n(8.5) implies that the loop equation for (6.1) cannot be satisfied in this case.\n\nReferences\n[1] A.
