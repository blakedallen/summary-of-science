Another reason is due to the fact that the\nexistence of Kondo effect in ferromagnetic host remains\ncontroversial. At a first glance, the traditional Kondo\nscreening seems possible only at temperature higher than\nthe Curie point where host magnetization vanishes. Otherwise, a local impurity could not change the total magnetization, opposite to what happened in dilute alloys.\nHowever, as far as the screening of a local moment is\nconcerned, the issue should be how the impurity behavior changes as the temperature lowers down. The above\npicture does not necessary hold true even for the host\ngoes away from the critical point where the long range\norder is destroyed by strong fluctuations. Yet there is no\nrigorous proof of the absence of overscreening in low temperature ferromagnet . In a earlier publication, Larkin\nand Mel'nikov first studied the Kondo effect in an almost\nferromagnetic metal7 . With traditional perturbation theory they shown that the impurity susceptibility is almost\nCurie type with logarithmic corrections at intermediately\nlow temperature and the usual Kondo screening is not\neffective. More recently, the authors studied a similar\nproblem in 1D, i.e., a boundary Kondo impurity of spin\nS \u2032 in S = 1/2 ferromagnet8 . The model provides us a\nfirst exact soluble example for the Kondo problem near a\nquantum critical point. Via Bethe ansatz solution it has\nbeen shown that at sufficient low temperature, the impurity spin is completely screened by 2S \u2032 host spins. Thus a\nlocal composite forms near the impurity site and shows a\nsimple power law dependence of specific heat on temperature. Therefore, these interest results strongly motivate\nus to know what will happen for a magnetic impurity in a\nmultichannel ferromagnetic host at low temperature and\nif there exhibits the conventional overscreened Kondo effect.\nIn order to study the multichannel Kondo problem in\nferromagnet via exact solution, we consider a magnetic\nimpurity S \u2032 = 1/2 coupled to an open spin-S chain which\nis integrable by Bethe ansatz. A well known integrable\nextension of isotropic S = 1/2 spin chain to arbitrary\nspin S is9\u201311\n\nWe study the low temperature behavior of a boundary magnetic impurity S \u2032 = 1/2 in an open ferromagnetic\nTakhatajian-Babujian spin-S chain. For antiferromagnetic\nKondo coupling, it is shown via Bethe ansatz solution that\nthe impurity spin is always locked into the critical behavior\nof the bulk. At low temperature, a local composite of spin(S \u2212 1/2) forms near the impurity site and its contribution to\n1\nspecific heat is of simple power law T 2 . The absence of overscreened Kondo effect is due to the large correlation length of\nhost spins which is divergent near the quantum critical point.\n71.10.Pm, 72.10.Fk, 72.15.Qm,75.20.Hr\n\nMultichannel Kondo problem was originally proposed\nto study the magnetic impurity behavior in real metals1 .\nAt low temperature for antiferromagnetic Kondo coupling, the impurity spin S \u2032 is completely compensated by\nthe surrounding n-channel electrons when 2S \u2032 = n; while\nit is undercompensated for 2S \u2032 > n or overcompensated\nfor 2S \u2032 < n. The later situation (so-called overscreened\nKondo effect) bears no resemblance to a non-interacting\ngas of electrons2 and provides us a possible interpretation\nof non-Fermi liquid behavior observed in certain uraniun\nalloys3 as well as in certain tunneling problems in twolevel systems4 . As this effect is immediately destroyed\nby weak anisotropy, it has been a challenge to deduce its\nsignature relevant to other anomalous behavior in a variety of exotic metals, especially when the systems show\nreduced effective dimensionality, or undergo the proximity to quantum critical phase transitions5 . In this paper\nwe will concentrate on multichannel Kondo problem in\na typical quantum critical ferromagnet, with the number\nof channels n being represented by the host spin, n = 2S.\nContrary to the problem in antiferromagnetic host chain,\nwhere overscreened Kondo effect appears when S > S \u2032 ,\nwe will find that due to the divergent correlation length\nnear the critical point, the overscreened Kondo effect\ndoes not exist in ferromagnetic host.\nWhile the Kondo problems in paramagnetic or antiferromagnetic hosts have been intensively investigated over\nthree decades, they attract little attentions in ferromagnetic host. The main reason is the difficulty in approaching this problem, i.e., usual perturbation techniques as\nwell as bosonization fail in the critical region because of\nthe absence of the \"large energy scale\", i.e., the Fermi energy. Recent investigations have been shown that as the\nsystem closes to a quantum critical point, the impurity\n\nHS = J0\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\n~j * S\n~j+1 ),\nQ2S (S\n\n(1)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere Q2S (x) is a polynomial of degree 2S of SU (2) in~j * S\n~j+1 . The general construction\nvariant quantities x = S\nfor QS (x) is given in Ref.[10,11], one recovers the standard Heisenberg model and Takhatajian-Babujian model\n1\n\n\ffor S = 1/2 and S = 1 respectively. Here we follow the\ndefinition of HS appeared in Ref.[11] so that the singlemagnon dispersion coincides with that of the standard\nHeisenberg ferromagnet. Thus for J0 < 0, the model\n(1) is qualitatively equivalent to the standard spin-S ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain11 . The boundary impurity\nspin is now coupled to the first host spin as\n~1 * S~\u2032 .\nHimp = J S\n\npure states are those with spin aligned along an arbitrary\naxis. With finite T and H the elementary excitations are\nn-magnons, bound states carrying n quanta of reduction\nof magnetization along the ordered axis. Each n-magnon\nhas energy \u01ebn = 2|J0 |an,2S (\u03bb) with crystal momentum\nPn,2S\n. In open boundary probK = 4 p=1\narctan n+2S+1\u22122p\n2|\u03bb|\nlem, K is positive. The energy spectrum \u01ebn (K) is a continuous function, increases monotonically as K varies in\n[0, \u03c0min(n, 2S)]. The long-wavelength limit, i.e., K \u223c 0,\n\u01ebn (K) \u223c |J0 |SK 2 /n, corresponds to |\u03bb| \u223c \u221e. The absence of gap for all n-magnons at boundaries of Brillouin zones \u03c0min(n, 2S) indicates the exact cancellation\nof Umklapp processes11 . Correspondingly in thermodynamics limit, the driving term in Eq.(4) dominates when\nT \u2192 0, all \u03b7n (\u03bb) functions are relevant. The situation is\nquite different to antiferromagnetic host (J0 > 0), where\nonly \u03b72S (\u03bb) is relevant as T \u2192 0. So the solutions of\nEq.(4) are more complicated for J0 < 0 . Here two\nlimiting cases are important: (a) Weak coupling limit:\nT \u2192 \u221e. The driving term disappears, there is only one\nparameter in equations, x0 = H/T , the solutions are\n\n(2)\n\nThe novelty of this construction is that the total Hamiltonian HS + Himp is again integrable for any J0 and J 12,13 .\nThe result is compared with the problem of a single impurity in periodic spin chains14 , where the integrability\nrequires a fixed Kondo coupling J and a fine turned impurity interaction instead of simple form (2). As long as\nspin dynamics is concerned, the integrable spin-S chain\nrepresents the multichannel host, because Kondo screening of the impurity is equivalent to usual multichannel\nKondo problem in antiferromagnetic case(J0 > 0)14 : the\nimpurity spin is completely screened for S \u2032 = S; partially\nscreened for S \u2032 > S, with Schottky anomaly when an external magnetic field H is applied; and overscreened for\nS \u2032 < S, giving rise to quantum critical behavior.\nThe model Hamiltonian is solved within the framework of Bethe ansatz approach to impurity problem13,15 .\nEigenstates of the model are parameterized by a set of\nrapidities {\u03bb\u03b1 }M\n\u03b1=1 (M being the number of down spins),\nwith total magnetization Sz = N S + 1/2 \u2212 M . Each rapidity represents a magnon of energy \u2212J0 S/(\u03bb2\u03b1 + S 2 ),\nthey are solutions of Bethe ansatz equations\neimp (\u03bb\u03b1 )e2N\n2S (\u03bb\u03b1 )\n\n=\n\nM\nYY\n\ne2 (\u03bb\u03b1 \u00b1 \u03bb\u03b2 )\n\n\u03b7n =\n\n\u03b7n (\u03bb) = exp[(nH + \u03c0an,2S (\u03bb)|J0 |)/T ].\n\n(6)\n\nAt zero temperature, \u03b7n = \u221e for all n, i.e., no magnons,\nthe ferromagnetic groundstate with Sz /N = S and\nE/N = H is reproduced. At low but finite temperature,\n\u03b7n (\u03bb) as function of \u03bb and n show crossovers between the\ntwo asymptotic solutions (5) and (6). In principle, they\ncan be solved numerically for fixed T and H. To study\nthe critical behavior of S = 1/2 ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, Schlottmann17 proposed an analytic method\nto solve these equations, based on an elegant but simple correlation-length approximation, and the result coincides with the numerical one very well17,18 . His idea is\nnow developed for arbitrary S as follows.\nLet us first notice that for sufficient large |\u03bb|, the driving term becomes negligible and one reproduces the weak\ncoupling solution Eq.(5) for all n, up to O(e\u2212\u03c0|\u03bb| |J0 |/T ).\nSimilarly, for sufficient large string index n, \u03b7n (\u03bb) is again\nclose to Eq.(5), because the effect of the driving term is\nalso negligible. On the other hand, for small |\u03bb| and n,\nthe driving term dominates, \u03b7n (\u03bb) approach the strong\ncoupling solution (6). For intermediate \u03bb and n we have\na crossover region. By equating two solutions (5),(6)\nfor small \u03bb and H, we define a crossover scale nc (T ) as\n2S|J0 |nc = T ln[nc (nc + 1)]/2, or solving it iteratively for\nT << |J0 |,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere er (x) = x+ir/2\nx\u2212ir/2 , eimp (x) = e1+2c (x)e1\u22122c (x) with\np\nc = (S + 1/2)2 \u2212 J0 /J. In the following, we only consider the case J0 < 0, J > 0, so c \u2265 S + 1/2. In the\nthermodynamics limit the solutions are classified by nstrings or n-magnons, they are associated with functions\n\u03b7n (\u03bb) ( with real rapidity \u03bb16 ), which in thermal equilibrium for finite temperature T and field H satisfy an\ninfinite set of non-linearly coupled integral equations:\n\u03c0 |J0 |\n\u03b4n,2S + G ln[(1 + \u03b7n\u22121 )(1 + \u03b7n+1 )],\ng T\n\n(5)\n\nfor all \u03bb and n, this is the free spin limit. (b) Strong\ncoupling limit: T \u2192 0. In this case the driving term\ndiverges, ln(1 + \u03b7n ) \u223c ln \u03b7n , we obtain\n\n\u00b1 \u03b26=\u03b1\n\nln \u03b7n =\n\nsinh2 [(n + 1)x0 ]\n\u22121\nsinh2 x0\n\n(4)\n\nwith the asymptotic condition limn\u2192\u221e ln \u03b7nn (\u03bb) = H/T \u2261\n2x0 . Here, G is an integral operator with kernel g(\u03bb) =\n1/2 cosh(\u03c0\u03bb). Notice that the free energy, expressed in\nterms of \u03b7n (\u03bb), consists of three parts F = Fbulk +\n1\nN (Fimp + Fedge ), bulk part is always the dominate one,\nimpurity and edge parts are both of order of 1/N , edge\npart is only due to the open boundary condition and is\nirrelevant to spin dynamics. We will discuss bulk and\nimpurity parts in the following.\nFerromagnetic host. The groundstate of ferromagnetic\nhost has M = 0 with finite magnetization S per site.

One notices that\n\u03bb = i(c \u2212 1/2) is the only possible boundary mode for\nS \u2032 = 1/2 and no boundary string8 is allowed because\n\u03bb = i(c + 1/2) is forbidden as shown in Eq.(3).\nTherefore, by taking into account the pure imaginary\nmode, the BAE for the bulk rapidities read\ne2N\n2S (\u03bb\u03b1 )\n\nnc\nX\n\n{ln[1 +\n\nm=1\n\nWhen 2c is an integer, the impurity free energy is the\ndifference of contribution from two effective \"ghost\" spins\nS+ = c \u2212 1/2 and S\u2212 = c \u2212 3/213\nZ\nT\nFimp = \u2212\nd\u03bbg(\u03bb)[\u03b62c\u22121 (\u03bb) \u2212 \u03b62c\u22123 (\u03bb)].\n(12)\n2\nOne finds that the leading contributions from the impurity is the same as that of 12 \u2212spin(rescaling of J0 is\nused), but is always negative, i.e., Cimp = \u2212C1/2 \u223c T 1/2 ,\n\u03c7imp = \u2212\u03c71/2 \u223c (T 2 ln T )\u22121 , indicating the freezing of\nsome degrees of freedom of the bulk. Notice that cdependence arises only in the next orders. When 2c is\nnot an integer, the situation is somewhat more complicated. In this case, there are additional contributions\ncoming from the non-zero residue {2c} = 2c \u2212 [2c] ([2c]\nis the integer part of 2c), which renormalize the effective\nKondo temperature Tk \u223c 1/ cos(\u03c0{2c}/2) as well as the\nphysical quantities. Explicit calculation shows that they\nonly change the subleading behavior.\nThe effect of the local composite can be analyzed in\nthe same way. This local composite is made of the impurity spin and the neighboring host spin. In contrast to\nthe single channel problem where the local composite is\nalways a spin singlet, the present one is not a spin singlet,\nbut with a residual spin S \u2212 1/2. Its feature is encoded\nin BAE as follows\n\n1\n2\n] \u2212 x20 }Bmn (\u03bbcm \u2212 \u03bb) (9)\nm(m + 2)\n3\n+2n ln\n\nsinh(1 + nc )x0\n,\nsinh nc x0\n\nR \u2212\u03bbc\nR\u221e\nwith Bmn (\u03bbcm \u2212 \u03bb) = ( \u2212\u221em + \u03bbc )Amn (\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb\u2032 )d\u03bb\u2032 .\nm\nTheR leading contribution to bulk free energy Fbulk =\n\u2212T d\u03bbg(\u03bb)\u03b62S (\u03bb) for small T and H/T is estimated as\nFbulk = \u22121.1(\n\n\u22120.42|J0|\n\n(11)\n\n\u03b26=\u03b1\n\nObviously \u03bbcn (T ) is the correlation length in momentum\nspace: for |\u03bb| > \u03bbcn (T ) (long wave-length or low energy), \u03b7n (\u03bb) is close to weak coupling solution, while\nfor |\u03bb| < \u03bbcn (T ) (and n < nc ) it is close to strong\ncoupling one. Thus we adopt the following strategy to\nsolve \u03b7n (\u03bb), or more conveniently, to calculate \u03b6n (\u03bb) =\nln[1 + \u03b7n (\u03bb)] \u2212 [\u03c0an,2S (\u03bb)|J0 | + nH]/T : (i) As a zero order approximation, we assume \u03b7n (\u03bb) = \u221e for n < nc\nand |\u03bb| < \u03bbcn , and elsewhere is given by Eq.(5).

The\nfinite-field contribution of the free energy, which comes\nfrom all kinds of n\u2212magnons, is a result of competition\nof both parts, and it is approximately proportional to\nthe correlation length nc , giving rise logarithmic corrections to the bulk susceptibility. Notice that by rescaling 2SJ0 \u2192 J0 , the bulk free energy is proportional\nto that of the standard spin\u22121/2 ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, so one obtains Cbulk = 2SC1/2 \u223c T 1/2 and\n\u03c7bulk = 2S\u03c71/2 \u223c T \u22122 ln\u22121 T .\nBoundary impurity.

In this paper, we studied\na spin-1/2 boundary impurity coupled to the ferromagnetic spin-S chain. The results were obtained with the\nassumption that the crossover from strong coupling to\nweak one is abrupt. A smooth crossover region should not\nmodify the low-T and small H/T dependences of the free\nenergies obtained. Moreover, if the correlation lengthens\nnc and \u03bbcn are scaled, the low-T dependence of our results\nremain unchanged, only the amplitudes are rescaled. The\nleading zero-field dependence of the bulk free energy is\na rigorous result, even the amplitude agrees well with\nthose obtained numerically for S = 1/219 , or analytically\nfor S > 1/2 via spin-wave theory20 . However, since all\nn\u2212strings contribute, the situation is more complicated\nfor the susceptibility, logarithmic corrections in susceptibility arise even without Kondo impurity, indicating the\nexistence of a marginal variable which does not exist in\nclassical spin wave solution.\nThe impurity effects are controlled by the bulk properties and the impurity coupling. In the case of antiferromagnetic host, see Ref.[12,13], a boundary impurity will\nshows the usual Kondo effect when the impurity spin S \u2032\nis less than or equal to the host spin S, i.e., S \u2032 > S,\notherwise, it shows a typical overscreened Kondo effect,\ni.e., S > S \u2032 . Depending on the Kondo coupling J, or c,\nthere exhibits some novel quantum critical phenomenon\nin both cases. In the case of ferromagnetic host, the\nsingle channel problem (S = 1/2, S \u2032 \u2265 1/2) shows a\nnovel Kondo diamagnetic effect, the impurity spin is completely screened by surrounding 2S \u2032 host spins for antiferromagnetic J > 0. Other magnons see a local composite formed around the impurity site and interact with it\nweakly.\nThe situation for multichannel ferromagnetic is dramatically changed. Due to the presence of antifrromagnetic coupled impurity, there is always a pure imaginary\nmode in addition to the bulk n-magnons. The magnetization is suppressed due to the local composite which is\na spin S \u2212 1/2 object. But the impurity spin is not overscreened, in contrast to that in antiferromagnetic host.\nRather, it is locked into the critical behavior of the bulk,\nwith impurity specific heat showing a simple power law\n1\nCimp \u223c T 2 . The local composite now effectively coupled\nferromagnetically to the other host spins via quantum\nfluctuation, showing the same power law specific heat\n1\nCloc \u223c T 2 . The absence of multichannel Kondo effect is\ndue to the large correlation length nc which is divergent\nwhen T \u2192 0. Though these results are limited to 1D ,\nsimilar phenomena may exist in higher dimensions. In\nmultichannel ferromagnet, the antiferromagnetic Kondo\ncoupling always leads to a local composite of a smaller\nspin, and leads to ferrimagnetic state when there is a\nfinite density distribution of the impurities.\n\n1\n\nP.
