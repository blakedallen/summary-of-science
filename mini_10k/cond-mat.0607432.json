Phys. Lett. 88, 162503 (2006)]\"\nMichael E. Flatt\u00e9\nOptical Science and Technology Center and Department of Physics and Astronomy,\nUniversity of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA\nKimberley C. Hall\nDepartment of Physics, Dalhousie University, Dalhousie, Canada\n\n1\n\n\fIn our previous Letter we analyzed the fundamental physical properties limiting the\nperformance of spin field effect transistors and compared them to ordinary (charge-based)\nfield effect transistors.1 The comment by Bandyopadhyay and Cahay2 makes two claims: (1)\nthat the threshold voltage of a metal-oxide-semiconductor-field-effect-transistor (MOSFET)\ncan be lower than the 400 mV described in the semiconductor roadmap3 , and (2) that the\ninjection of spin-polarized currents of sufficient polarization may not be possible. In this\nresponse we reiterate that the subthreshold voltage swing at room temperature precludes\nthe achievement of (1) without sacrificing the on-off current ratio, and that no fundamental\nlimits exist to the polarization of injected spin-polarized current.\nIn Ref. 1 our comparative analysis of the spin field effect transistor of Ref. 4 and the\nMOSFET was performed at room temperature, whereas in Ref. 2 the analysis was performed\nat zero temperature. The textbook minimum subthreshold voltage swing of the MOSFET\n(see, e.g. Ref. 5) at room temperature is 60 mV/decade. It is determined by thermal\nactivation over the MOSFET barrier (exp[eV /kB T ] = 10, where e is the electron charge, V\nthe voltage, kB Boltzmann's constant, and T the temperature). At room temperature the\nthreshold voltage of 15.7 mV for the MOSFET from Ref. 2 directly implies an on-off current\nratio of 1.9, which does not compare favorably with the on-off ratios of 105 for the spin-FET\ndescribed in our Letter. Thus the statement of Ref. 2 that \"The MOSFET could always win\nby lowering the carrier concentration in the channel\" is false at room temperature.\nAs described in detail in Ref. 1, a major advantage of the spin-FET is the ability to avoid\nthe fundamental MOSFET limit on threshold voltage due to the 60 mV/decade subthreshold\nvoltage swing. This is possible because the spin-FET switching is not performed by raising\nor lowering a barrier (as shown in Figs. 1 and 2 of Ref. 1).\nRef. 2 inquires how much voltage drop is across the 2018 CMOS MOSFET oxide, which\nis directly available from the roadmap3 (in 2018 it is about 70% of the total). The voltage\ndrop across the oxide in Ref. 1 was neglected because the spin-FET's capacitance is very\nsmall (\u223c 9 times smaller than the capacitance of the 2018 CMOS MOSFET oxide). Thus\nif the same oxide is used for the spin-FET as planned for 2018 CMOS, the presence of the\noxide changes the total spin-FET capacitance by only \u223c 10%, and the voltage drop across\nthe oxide is \u223c 10% of the total voltage drop, changing the threshold voltage by \u223c 10%.\nThe second criticism of Ref. 2 is that the injection of spin-polarized currents of sufficient\npolarization may not be possible. Ref. 2 declares that \"realistically, the on-off ratio will be\n2\n\n\flow, probably < 10 at room temperature\", relying on 2006 state of the art spin injection\nefficiencies. As stated in our Ref. 1, our focus was on fundamental power dissipation limits,\nand the comparison presented was to 2018 CMOS. Ref. 2 has failed to provide any argument\nwhy the 2006 state of the art should be considered a fundamental limit on spin injection\nefficiency and apply to 2018 comparisons (indeed, 7 years ago spin injection into semiconductors had not even been demonstrated, yet now the efficiency at room temperature exceeds\n70%)6 . Just as advances in contacting technology of metals to semiconductors permitted\nnearly 100% electron current injection (as opposed to a mixture of electron and hole current), nearly 100% spin-polarized currents are achievable through advances in ferromagnetic\ncontacting technology. As addressed in Ref. 1, the use of highly spin-selective barriers6 or\nhalf-metallic ferromagnetic contacts7 are two avenues predicted to provide nearly 100% spin\ninjection efficiencies. No fundamental roadblocks prevent this.\nThus the criticism of Ref. 2 regarding the threshold voltage of the spin-FET is specious,\nas it compares a zero temperature result for the MOSFET with a room temperature result\nfor the spin-FET. In our Letter the proper comparison was done. The criticism of Ref. 2\nregarding the efficiency of spin injection is a guess, not based on physical analysis, that the\nrapid progress over the last 7 years towards high-efficiency spin-polarized current injection\nwill suddenly stop. Fundamental analysis suggests otherwise.\nThis work was supported by DARPA/ONR and the Natural Sciences and Engineering\nResearch Council of Canada.\n\n3\n\n\f1\n\nK. C. Hall and M. E.
