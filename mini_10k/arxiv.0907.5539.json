Control is implemented by adding Poisson distributed vaccination of susceptibles. We\nshow that vaccine control is much more effective in adaptive networks than in static networks due to\nan interaction between the adaptive network rewiring and the vaccine application. Disease extinction\nrates using vaccination are computed, and orders of magnitude less vaccine application is needed to\ndrive the disease to extinction in an adaptive network than in a static one.\n\nModeling the spread of epidemics on static networks\nis a well developed field, but recent studies have begun\nto account for potentially time-varying network topologies. In particular, people may adjust their social behavior in response to the threat of an epidemic. Both\nan SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) model [1] and\nSIRS (susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible) model\n[2] have been studied on an adaptive network in which\nnon-infected nodes rewire their links adaptively away\nfrom infected neighbors and toward other non-infected\nnodes. Such adaptation typically increases the epidemic\nthreshold and reduces the number of infectious cases,\nand new disease dynamics and bifurcations are observed.\nSimilar results are seen when the nodes reconnect to randomly selected nodes elsewhere in the network [3, 4].\nBecause vaccines are available for many diseases, it is\ndesirable to examine the interplay between adaptively\nfluctuating social contacts and vaccination of susceptible\nindividuals.\nAlmost all diseases exhibit randomness resulting in observed fluctuations, as in [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. As diseases\nevolve in large populations, there is the possibility of finite time extinction [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Extinction\noccurs where the number of infectives become so small\nthat there is insufficient transmission to keep the disease\nin its endemic state [16, 17, 18]. Fluctuations cause the\ndisease free equilibrium (DFE) to be reached in a finite\ntime. Such an extinction process occurs even when the\nDFE is unstable. Populations based upon adaptive networks further complicate the problem, since social dynamical situations, such as disease avoidance strategies,\ncan cause the endemic and DFE to be bistable [2].\nA major characteristic of fluctuation-induced extinction in stochastic models for globally connected large\npopulations is the extinction rate. Viewing disease fadeout as coming from systems far from thermal equilibrium,\nfinite population extinction rate laws have been derived\nin SIS [15, 19] and SIR [20] models. In contrast to vaccine\nstrategies which stabilize the DFE [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26],\nperiodic pulsed vaccination was generalized to a random\nPoisson strategy, which exponentially enhances the rate\nof extinction [27].\n\nOther vaccine strategies have been examined in a variety of static network geometries. Targeting of high degree\nnodes is widely recognized as more effective than random vaccination, including in scale free networks [28, 29],\nsmall world networks [30], and more realistic social network geometries [31]. Because targeting the highest degree nodes requires full knowledge of the network geometry, other strategies based on local knowledge have been\ndeveloped. For example, vaccinating a random acquaintance of a randomly selected node tends to favor high\ndegree nodes and is again more effective than random\nvaccination [32]. When vaccine is very limited, outbreaks\ncan be minimized by fragmenting the network via a graph\npartitioning strategy which requires less vaccine than targeting high degree nodes [33]. Here we will use a random\nvaccination strategy and find that in conjunction with\nadaptive rewiring, it is extremely effective.\nWe create a new model by modifying an SIS model [1],\nadding a vaccine class (V). Individuals are connected in\na network, with non-infected nodes rewiring adaptively\nto reduce connections with infected nodes.\nThe transition probabilities are as follows. A susceptible node becomes infected with rate pNI,nbr , where NI,nbr\nis its number of infected neighbors. An infected node recovers (to susceptible) with rate r. Vaccination occurs\nin Poisson-distributed pulses with frequency \u03bd, and each\npulse vaccinates a fraction A of the susceptible nodes\n[34]. We assume that the vaccine is not permanent, so a\nvaccinated node becomes susceptible again with rate q,\nthe resusceptibility rate.\nWhile the epidemic spreads, the network is rewired\nadaptively. Because the vaccine wears off, we assume\nthat vaccinated nodes are uncertain of their infection status and thus rewire in the same way as susceptibles. If a\nlink connects a non-infected node to an infected node,\nthat link is rewired with rate w to connect the noninfected node to another randomly selected non-infected\nnode. Self links and multiple links between nodes are\nexcluded.\nWe simulate the full adaptive network via Monte Carlo\nsimulation in a similar fashion to [2].

Because we use\nproportional vaccination, as vaccination begins to lower\nthe number of infectives and the number of susceptibles\nincreases, subsequent vaccine pulses vaccinate a larger\nnumber of nodes.\nWe studied the longtime behavior for the case of longer\nlived endemic states. The deterministic mean field model\npredicts stable steady state dynamics for the static network, even when vaccine is applied. Small regions of\noscillatory behavior have been predicted for the adaptive network without vaccination [1], and these regions\nare predicted to be much larger when vaccination is applied. For the resusceptibility q used here, oscillations\nare generic [35].\nFigures 2(a)-2(d) compare the dependence of the mean\ninfective level on the vaccine frequency for static and\nadaptive networks [36]. For the full static (Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi)\nnetwork system (Fig. 2(b)), at each vaccine frequency the\nsteady state mean infectives were computed over ten network geometries. For the stochastic mean field (Fig.2(a)),\n100 runs were done to extinction (PI < 10\u221212 ) and the\n\n(a)\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n4\n\navg. degree\n\ntibles are selected randomly for vaccination, where NS is\nthe total number of susceptibles. Results are presented\nhere for N = 104 nodes and K = 105 links.\nWe have developed a mean field theory for the dynamics of nodes and links following [1, 2] . PA denotes the\nprobability of a node to be in state A, where A is either\nS, I, or V. PAB denotes the probability that a randomly\nselected link connects a node in state A to a node in\nstate B. \u03b7 = \u03b7(t) is the Poisson distributed vaccination\nwith mean frequency \u03bd and amplitude A. We obtain the\nfollowing set of stochastic differential equations for the\nnodes:\n\nfraction\n\n2\n\nx 10\n\n(b)\n50\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\ntime (MCS)\n\n1.5\n\n2\n4\n\nx 10\n\nFIG. 1: Sample time series. a) Node fractions.

The mean field\nand full model are in excellent agreement.\nFor the full system with rewiring (Fig. 2(d)), infectives\nwere averaged over 8\u00d7104 MCS for a single adaptive network for the smaller vaccine frequencies (\u03bd \u2264 0.00015),\nand error bars are the standard deviation. For larger\n\u03bd values the oscillations led to rapid die out, so the infectives were instead averaged over 100 runs computed\nto extinction, where the vaccine was turned on at time\n0. Error bars are the standard deviation of all the time\npoints. This averaging includes transients but serves to\nillustrate the decreasing infective levels and large fluctuations due to oscillations as \u03bd is increased. The stochastic\nmean field (Fig. 2(c)) was computed as in Fig. 2(a), and\nerror bars are the standard deviations of the means. The\nvaccination frequency required to significantly lower the\ninfected fraction in the adaptive network is much smaller\nthan for the static network due to the interaction of vaccination and rewiring. The mean field model accurately\npredicts the order of magnitude of vaccine required and\nthe presence of oscillations.\nFigure 3 shows the dependence of the endemic state\nlifetime on the vaccine frequency for static (Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi)\nand adaptive networks. About two orders of magnitude\nless vaccine is needed in the adaptive case to significantly\nreduce the lifetime of the endemic state. For the full system, each point was obtained by averaging 100 runs for\nwhich the initial condition was the vaccine-free steady\nstate and the vaccine was turned on at time zero. Mean\nfield results were obtained similarly, but the time to extinction was computed using a threshold for PI of 10\u221212 .\nTo explain the efficacy of vaccination in the adaptive\nnetwork, we examine the network structure in more detail, particularly the degree. Steady state degree distributions for an adaptive network with and without vaccination are shown in Figure 4. Results without vaccination were obtained similarly to those in [2].

As shown in Fig. 4(a), susceptibles in the adaptive network have a higher average degree than infectives\ndue to rewiring. This is also apparent at the beginning\nof the degree time series for susceptibles and infectives in\nFig. 1(b). Because the susceptibles typically have higher\ndegree, random vaccination of susceptible nodes favors\nthe higher degree nodes in the network and is therefore\nexpected to be effective, as in previous studies of targeted\nvaccination [28, 29, 30]. For a static network, in contrast,\n\nthe high degree nodes are most likely to be infected and\nthus will rarely be selected for vaccination.\nThe vaccination level used in Fig. 4(b) is small enough\nthat it only slightly lowers the number of infected nodes.\nHowever, when vaccination occurs the rewiring becomes\nmore effective because of the presence of \"safe\" nodes\nto wire to. The average infective degree is substantially\ndecreased, and the susceptible degree is substantially increased. The vaccinated nodes have a broad degree distribution with a very high average degree. For the parameter values in Figure 4(b), vaccinated nodes participate in links as frequently as susceptibles, even though\nthere are two orders of magnitude fewer vaccinated than\nsusceptibles.\nIn this model, we randomly vaccinated a fixed fraction A of the susceptible nodes during each vaccination\nevent. Information about the network structure was not\nrequired. This corresponds to the case where vaccine is\ninexpensive and anyone who is not infected can be vaccinated. If the vaccine were in limited supply, it would\nbe desirable to use some knowledge about the social network structure (such as the degrees) to target the vaccine\nmore carefully. In that case, the vaccine pulses might be\na fixed number of susceptibles rather than a fixed fraction. However, further study is needed to determine the\noptimal vaccination strategy. Another extension would\nbe to relax the assumption that nodes have full knowledge of others' disease status [3, 4].\nIn summary, we studied the effect of Poisson vaccination on epidemic spread in an adaptive network.

The\nadaptive rewiring then became more effective because of\nthe presence of \"safe\" vaccinated nodes to rewire to.\n\n0.04\n0.02\n0\n0\n\n50\n\nFIG. 4: Degree distributions from Monte Carlo simulation for\np = 0.002, r = 0.002, w = 0.04.

The qualitative advantage to including both vaccination and rewiring is the same whether or\nnot oscillations occur.\nThe bifurcation structure and infective levels depend primarily on the average vaccination rate \u03bdA rather than on\nthe frequency or amplitude individually.\n\n\f"}
