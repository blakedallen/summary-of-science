These and other observable\ndata are satisfactory described by the cosmological model based on the Einstein equations with\ncosmological constant: \u03a9\u039b = 0.74 \u00b1 0.02 (see [1, 6, 31] and references therein). But its physical\ninterpretation is rather problematic [14, 22, 23, 30]. Therefore alternative approaches \u2013 new\nphysical fields (classical scalar field \u2013 quintessence, tachyon field, k-essence, phantom field,\nquintom field, Chaplygin gas), gravity and general relativity modifications, multidimensional\ngravity, branes and others \u2013 are analyzed (see reviews [14, 15, 13, 21, 23, 30]).\nIn this paper the scalar field filling the Universe and causing its accelerated expansion is\nstudied. The Universe is considered to be homogeneously filled with the dust matter (density\nin units of critical \u03a9m ) and dark energy (density \u03a9de and equation of state \u22121 \u2264 wde \u2264 \u22121/3).\nAccording to modern data the dust matter consists of cold dark matter (\u03a9cdm \u2248 0.21) and usual\nbaryons (\u03a9b \u2248 0.05). The reconstruction of scalar field with classical and tachyonic Lagrangian\nis made for cosmological parameters derived from observations.\n\n1\n\nCosmological model and scalar field equations\n\nWe consider the homogeneous and isotropic Universe with metrics of 4-space\n\u0011\n\u0010\ndr 2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nds2 = gij dxi dxj = c2 dt2 \u2212 a2 (t)\n,\nd\u03b8\n+\nsin\n\u03b8d\u03c6\n+\nr\n1 \u2212 kr 2\n\"\n\n1\n\n#\n\n(1)\n\n\fwhere k = +1, 0, \u22121 for Riemannian, Euclidean and Lobachevskian 3-space respectively. The\nfactor a(t) is a radius of 3-sphere (k = +1), 3-pseudosphere (k = \u22121) or the scale factor,\nnormalized to 1 at current epoch (k = 0). Here and below the latin indices i, j, ... run from 0\nto 3, the greek ones \u2013 over the spatial part of the metrics: \u03bd, \u03bc, ...=1, 2, 3. Henceforth we also\nput c = 1, so the time variable t \u2261 x0 has the dimension of a length. If the Universe is filled\nwith dust matter and dark energy, the dynamics of its expansion is completely described by\nthe Einstein equations\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\n(m)\n(de)\nRij \u2212 gij R = 8\u03c0G Tij + Tij\n,\n(2)\n2\n(m)\n\n(de)\n\nwhere Rij is the Ricci tensor and Tij , Tij \u2013 energy-momentum tensors of matter (m) and\ndark energy (de).

For ideal fluid with density \u03c1(m,de) and pressure p(m,de) , related\nby the equation of state p(m,de) = w(m,de) \u03c1(m,de) , it gives\n\u0227\n\u03c1\u0307(m,de) = \u22123 \u03c1(m,de) (1 + w(m,de) )\na\n\n(4)\n\n(here and below a dot over the variable denotes the derivative with respect to time: \"  \u0307 \"\u2261 d/dt).\nFor constant w(m,de) these equations are easily integrated and dependences of dust matter and\ndark energy densities on the scale factor are simply obtained:\n(0)\n\n\u22123\n\u22123(1+wde )\n\u03c1m = \u03c1(0)\nm (a/a0 ) , \u03c1de = \u03c1de (a/a0 )\n\n(5)\n\n(here and below \"0\" denotes the present values). The matter is considered to be non-relativistic,\nso wm = 0.\nLet the dark energy be a scalar field \u03c6(x, t) with classical Lagrangian\n1\nL = \u03c6;i \u03c6;i \u2212 V (\u03c6),\n2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere V (\u03c6) \u2013 potential energy density or the field potential. We suppose also the scalar field\nto be homogeneous in expanding homogeneous isotropic Universe (\u03c6(x, t) = \u03c6(t)), so its energy\ndensity and pressure depends only on time:\n1\n1\n\u03c1de (t) = \u03c6\u03072 + V (\u03c6), pde (t) = \u03c6\u03072 \u2212 V (\u03c6).\n2\n2\n\n(7)\n\nThen the conservation law (3) gives the scalar field evolution equation\n\u03c6\u0308 + 3H \u03c6\u0307 = \u2212dV /d\u03c6,\nwhere H = \u0227/a is the Hubble constant for any moment of time t.\nIf the Lagrangian of scalar field has the form\nq\n\nL = \u2212V (\u03c6) 1 \u2212 \u03c6;i \u03c6;i ,\n\n(8)\n\nsuch field is called the tachyon one (see [20] and references therein). The energy density and\npressure of the homogeneous tachyon field are defined as follows:\n\u03c1de =\n\nV (\u03c6)\nq\n\n1\u2212\n\n\u03c6\u03072\n\n,\n\nq\n\npde = \u2212V (\u03c6) 1 \u2212 \u03c6\u03072 .\n2\n\n(9)\n\n\fThe conservation equation (3) describes the evolution of the tachyon field in a such way:\n!\n\n1 dV\n+ 3H \u03c6\u0307 = 0.\n\u03c6\u0308 + (1 \u2212 \u03c6\u0307 )\nV d\u03c6\n2\n\nLet's define the dimensionless densities \u03a9m , \u03a9de and \u03a9k :\n\u03a9m =\n\n(0)\n\n\u03c1(0)\nm\n\n\u03c1de\nka\u22122\n0\n,\n,\n\u03a9\n=\n,\n\u03a9\n=\n\u2212\nde\nk\n2\n(0)\n(0)\nH\n\u03c1cr\n\u03c1cr\n0\n\n\u22122\n2\nwhere \u03c1(0)\ncr = 3H0 /8\u03c0G is critical density of the Universe at the present epoch and ka0 \u2013 the\n3-space curvature. Using them, the Einstein equations for the model of the Universe with dust\nmatter, dark energy and curvature can be written in form:\n\nq\n\nH = H0 \u03a9m (a0 /a)3 + \u03a9k (a0 /a)2 + \u03a9de (a0 /a)3(1+wde ) ,\nq =\n\n1 \u03a9m (a0 /a)3 + (1 + 3wde )\u03a9de (a0 /a)3(1+wde )\n,\n2 \u03a9m (a0 /a)3 + \u03a9k (a0 /a)2 + \u03a9de (a0 /a)3(1+wde )\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\nwhere q = \u2212\u00e4/(aH 2 ) - the acceleration parameter for any time t.\nThe first equation rewritten for the present time t0 gives the equality: \u03a9de + \u03a9m + \u03a9k = 1.\nFrom the second one it follows that the accelerated expansion (q < 0) is possible only when\nwde < \u22121/3. At the early stages of the evolution of the Universe q > 0 always and q \u2192 0.5 when\na \u2192 0. The change of acceleration sign (moment when q = 0) or transition from deceleration\nto acceleration occurs at redshift zq which depends on the relation between the matter and\ndark energy densities: zq = [\u2212(1 + 3wde )\u03a9de /\u03a9m ]\u22121/(3wde ) \u2212 1. The scalar field density begins\nto dominate (\u03c1de \u2265 \u03c1m ), when zde = (\u03a9de /\u03a9m )\u22121/(3wde ) \u2212 1. To be a candidate for dark energy\nthe scalar field with Lagrangian (6) must satisfy the condition \u03c6\u03072 \u2264 V (\u03c6). If \u03c6\u03072 \u226a V (\u03c6) then\nwe will have the scalar field analogous to cosmological constant in the Einstein equations \u2013\nwde = \u22121. For field with Lagrangian (8) the expansion accelerates when 0 \u2264 \u03c6\u03072 < 2/3. The\nscalar field with Lagrangian (6) which satisfies the conditions \u03c6\u03072 > 0 and \u22121 \u2264 wde \u2264 \u22121/3\nis called quintessence and cosmological models with \u03a9de > \u03a9cdm > \u03a9b are noted by QCDM. In\nthis work we call QCDM both models (6) and (8).\nIf H0 , \u03a9m , \u03a9de and wde are derived from the observations of dynamics of the Universe\nacceleration and CMB temperature fluctuations, it is possible to find the form of V (\u03c6). The\nallowed ranges for cosmological parameters determine the uncertanties in the quantities V , \u03c6,\nq and others. We will reconstruct the scalar field for the cosmological model with parameters\nderived from WMAP and other projects data [31, 4] (the best-fit values and their 1\u03c3-confidence\nintervals):\n+0.051\n+0.017\n+0.016\n\u03a9de = 0.745+0.017\n\u22120.017 , wde = \u22120.915\u22120.051 , \u03a9m = 0.255\u22120.017 , h = 0.7\u22120.017 ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere h \u2261 H0 /100km/s/Mpc. The equation (10) for the present time gives \u03a9k = 0\u00b10.034. Fig.\n1 (left) shows the functions \u03a9m (a) = \u03c1m /\u03c1cr and \u03a9de (a) = \u03c1de /\u03c1cr for the best-fit parameters\nand their values on upper and lower limits of the confidence intervals (12). In this model, as\nit can be seen in Fig. 1, the matter density is equal to the dark energy one at zde \u2248 0.48\n(a \u2248 0.68). The epoch of the dark energy density domination begins at this redshift. For\ncomparison the corresponding curves for the \u039bCDM-model with parameters [1] and zde \u2248 0.38\n(a \u2248 0.72) are shown. Their practically identical asymptotic behavior at a \u2192 0 shows that the\ndark energy with the parameters (12) can't remove the problem of fine tuning of densities of\nthe components at the end of the phase transitions in the early Universe [5]. The right panel\n3\n\n\fFigure 1: Left: the dark energy (solid line) and matter (dashed) densities (in units of critical\ndensity) as functions of the scale factor.

Right: the acceleration parameter q as a\nfunction of a for the QCDM- and \u039bCDM-models.\nof Fig. 1 shows the acceleration parameter as a function of a for the best-fit parameters and\ntheir values at the upper and lower limits of the confidence intervals (12). The acceleration sign\nchange in QCDM-model takes place at zq \u2248 0.81 (a = 0.55), in \u039bCDM-model \u2013 at zq \u2248 0.74\n(a = 0.57). In QCDM-model (12) the main contribution to variation of q at z \u2248 0 gives the\nuncertainty of wde and at z \u2248 zq \u2013 uncertainty of \u03a9m .\n\n2\n\nThe evolution of quintessence\n\nIt is possible to find the scalar field \u03c6 and its potential V as the functions of time or the scale\nfactor a using (7) and (10):\ns\n\na/a0 dy\n3\n(1 + wde )\n\u00d7\n8\u03c0G\ny\n1\ns\n\u03a9de y \u22123wde\n,\n1 \u2212 \u03a9k \u2212 \u03a9de + \u03a9k y + \u03a9de y \u22123wde\n1 \u2212 wde\n3H02\n\u03a9de\n(a0 /a)3(1+wde )\nV (a) =\n8\u03c0G\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u03c6(a) \u2212 \u03c60 = \u00b1\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\n(here and below \u03c60 = \u03c6(a0 )).

Fig. 2 shows the evolution of \u03c6(a) and V (a) for the best-fit parameters\nand their values at the upper and lower limits of the confidence intervals (12). It has been\nfound that for small a the most of variation is due to the uncertainty in wde and for a \u223c a0 the\nuncertainty in H0 becomes important. The uncertainty in \u03c6 is mainly caused by error of wde .\nWhen a \u2192 0 then the potential V and kinetic term \u03c6\u03072 go to \u221e in a such way that wde =\n( 12 \u03c6\u03072 \u2212 V )/( 12 \u03c6\u03072 + V ) = const. For known dependences \u03c6(a) and V (a) the potential V (\u03c6) can\nbe presented in a parametric form (\u03c6(a), V (a)). For the flat model (\u03a9k = 0) it is easy to find\nthe explicit function V (\u03c6).

It is obvious that now we can't invert \u03c6(a) and get the explicit expression V (\u03c6), but\nthe inverse function \u03c6(V ) can be easily written.\nComparison of the results of numerical evaluation of (13) with the linear approximation\n(17) shows, that the error of this approximation is not larger than 0.08% (at the 1\u03c3-confidence\nlimits of parameters).\nThe potentials V (\u03c6) for the best-fit parameters wde , \u03a9m , \u03a9de , H0 and their values at the\nupper and lower limits of the confidence intervals are shown in Fig. 3 (time intervals are\nmarked along the curves by points). It can be seen that 2 independent symmetric with respect\nto \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 = 0 potentials exist.

It has been found that for \u03c6(a \u2248 0) the difference is maximal for the curves with\nthe different values of wde , when for \u03c6(a \u223c a0 ) the variation of V (\u03c6) is caused mainly by the\nuncertainty in H0 .\n\n3\n\nEvolution of the tachyon field\n\nFor the scalar field with Lagrangian (8) and wde = \u03c6\u03072 \u2212 1 = const it can be seen that \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 =\n\u221a\n1 + wde (t \u2212 t0 ): the tachyon field is proportional to the time. However, it is convenient to\nrepresent the field \u03c6 and its potential V as functions of the scale factor a or redshift z.

Linear in \u03a9k correction is\n\u2206tk\n\n(a/a0 )5/2 \u03a9k\n5\n5\n\u03a9de\n3\n=\u2212\n,\u2212\n;1\u2212\n;\u2212\n(a0 /a)3wde .\n2 F1\n3/2\n5H0 (1 \u2212 \u03a9de )\n2 6wde\n6wde 1 \u2212 \u03a9de\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nComparing the linear approximation with the results of the numerical integration of (26), it is\neasy to see that in this case the error is not greater than 0.07% (at the 1\u03c3-confidence limits of\nparameters).\nThe right panel of Fig. 6 shows the scale factor as a function of time for the best-fit cosmological parameters and their values at the upper and lower limits of 1\u03c3-confidence intervals.\nThe main variation in a(t) for t \u2265 2 * 1017 s is caused by the uncertainty in H0 . It can be easily\nseen that for small t the scale factor grows as a \u223c t2/3 (decelerated expansion) and later (at\nt \u2248 2 * 1017 s) the (quasi)exponential accelerated expansion begins \u2013 a \u223c exp Ht.\nAs it can be seen from Fig. 6, in the early Universe (a \u2264 0.35, z \u2265 1.86) the event horizon\nradius is larger than the particle horizon one both in the \u039bCDM- and QCDM-models. But in\nthe later epoch (a \u2265 0.35, z \u2264 1.86) Rp (a) \u2265 Re (a). At the present epoch (t0 \u2248 14 billion\nyears) Rp(0) \u2248 15 Gpc, Re \u2248 5.5 Gpc. For comparison, in the QCDM-model with parameters\n(12) the distance to quasars with z = 2 is \u2248 5.3 Gpc and to the CMB last scattering surface is\n\u224814.5 Gpc. It means that the events which take place on the constant-time t = t0 hypersurface\nat distance r > Re will never be seen by a terrestrial observer. So, the quasars with z \u2265 2\n10\n\n\fhave emitted the detected today light when the age of the Universe was t \u2264 3.5 billion years.\nWhen in future the terrestrial astronomers will study the objects on the constant-time t = t0\nhypersurface, the observable today quasars with z > 2 will be already outside the particle\nhorizon and will never \"reenter\" it.\n\n5\n\nCMB temperature and matter density fluctuations power\nspectra\n\nWe have analyzed the features of quintessence and tachyon field for the cosmological parameters\nderived from the observations of the CMB temperature fluctuations and inhomogeneities of the\ngalaxies spatial distribution power spectra and the dynamics of expansion of the Universe.\nFig. 7 shows the observed (circles) and computed power spectra for model with dark energy\nin the form of scalar field (6), (8) and cold dark matter (QCDM) and, for comparison, with\ncosmological term and cold dark matter (\u039bCDM). The parameters of the QCDM-model are\ntaken from [31, 4] (\u03a9de = 0.745 \u00b1 0.017, wde = \u2212(0.915 \u00b1 0.051), \u03a9m = 0.255 \u00b1 0.017, \u03a9b h2 =\n0.02198 \u00b1 0.017, h = 0.7 \u00b1 0.017, \u03c38 = 0.711 \u00b1 0.04, ns = 0.942 \u00b1 0.016) and of the \u039bCDMmodel \u2013 from [1] (\u03a9\u039b = 0.736 \u00b1 0.065, \u03a9m = 0.278 \u00b1 0.080, \u03a9b = 0.05 \u00b1 0.011, h = 0.68 \u00b1 0.09,\n\u03c38 = 0.73\u00b10.08, ns = 0.96\u00b10.015). As we can see, the curves of CMB temperature fluctuations\npower spectra for the QCDM- and \u039bCDM-models almost overlap and well approximate the\nobservable data from the WMAP experiment [18]. The difference is maximal near the third\nacoustic peak (l \u223c 700 \u2212 800). The goodness of the approximation of the observable spectrum\nby a model is characterised by the quantity \u03c72 : for the QCDM-model \u03c72 = 35.0, for the\n\u039bCDM-model \u03c72 = 37.2. Such difference isn't significant for 39 observable points, but suggests\nthat the QCDM-model with the given parameters is a bit closer to a model of the observable\nUniverse. The higher precision of data in the region near the third acoustic peak which is\nexpected in the planned experiment PLANCK would allow us to make a choice between the\n\u039bCDM- and QCDM-model. In the case of matter density perturbations power spectra the\nsituation is similar to that of CMB one. The unfilled circles in the right panel of the figure\nshow the galaxies concentration perturbations power spectrum from the digital sky survey SDSS\n[33]. The matter density perturbations power spectra for the \u039bCDM- and QCDM-models are\nsimply related to it as PSDSS (k) = b2 P (k), where b is the bising parameter determined by\nminimization of \u03c72 . For the \u039bCDM-model b = 1.2 with \u03c72min = 25.1, for the QCDM-model\nb = 1.3 with \u03c72min = 24.0. The difference of \u03c72min in these two models is not significant for 22\nobservable points.\nThus, the coincidence of the QCDM-model with observations is a little better than of the\n\u039bCDM-model, but the difference of \u03c72min -criterion isn't sufficient.\n\nConclusion\nIn Fig. 1, 6 it is shown that the dynamics of expansion of the Universe and its horizons are\nalmost the same for the \u039bCDM- and QCDM-models with the parameters derived from the\nsame observable data. The differences of the corresponding quantities in the \u039bCDM- and\nQCDM-models are comparable to the uncertainties caused by the experimental data errors.\nAt redshifts z > 5 the dynamics of expansion of the Universe becomes the same as for the\nstandard CDM-model: \u03a9m = 1, q = 1/2. It means that for identification of the source causing\nthe accelerated expansion of the Universe (cosmological constant or dark energy) the errors of\ndata of observable cosmology must be reduced approximately by an order. It is shown also\n11\n\n\fFigure 7: The CMB temperature (left) and matter density (right) fluctuations power spectra\nfor the models of Universe with dark energy: quintessence (solid line), cosmological constant\n(dashed).\nthat the cosmological effects of the quintessence and tachyon field can be indistinguishable.\nThe accelerated expansion of the Universe for these dark energy models is caused by slow\nrolling down of the fields \u03c6 to their minima V \u2192 0 at \u03c6 \u2192 \u00b1\u221e (Fig. 3, 5). For both fields\n\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 is finit when a \u2192 0, but V (a \u2192 0) \u2192 \u221e. For the QCDM-model of the Universe with\nparameters (12) the evolution of both fields is calculated (fig. 2, 4). The quintessence has in\nthis model such features: V (a) = 3695(a0 /a)0.255 eV/cm3 , \u03c6\u03072 /V = 0.0888, the tachyon field \u2013\nV (a) = 3691(a0 /a)0.255 eV/cm3 , \u03c6\u03072 = 0.085. The age of the Universe in the QCDM-model is\nt0 \u2248 14 billion years, the present particle horizon \u2013 Rp \u2248 15 Gpc, the event horizon \u2013 Re \u2248 5.5\nGpc.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the project of Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine \"The\nlinear and non-linear stages of evolution of the cosmological perturbations in models of the\nmulticomponent Universe with dark energy\" (state registration number 0107U002062) and the\nresearch program of National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine \"The exploration of the structure\nand components of the Universe, hidden mass and dark energy (Cosmomicrophysics)\" (state\nregistration number 0107U007279).
