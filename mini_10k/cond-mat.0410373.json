Introduction\nIt is common knowledge that the actual strength of glass is\nalways lower than its intrinsic strength owing to the presence of\nsurface microcracks, the so-called Griffith flaws [1,2]. Such\ndefects occur at the glass surface when contact is made with other\nobjects during fabrication or service.\nThe final rupture depends upon the strength and the geometry of\nthe flaw. Stress concentration appears at the crack tip and is\ncharacterized by the stress intensity factor K. For a sharp crack of\nlength c under an applied tensile stress \u03c3, \u039a is given by :\n\nK = Y\u03c3\n\nc\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Y is a geometric factor which depends on the shape of the\nsample. Failure occurs when the applied stress and flaw size give\nrise to a stress intensity factor which exceeds the critical stress\nintensity factor Kc. Kc is an intrinsic parameter of the material :\nKc = 0.72-0.86 MPa.m1/2 for soda-lime-silica plate glass.\nVarious techniques have been developed to strengthen glass :\netching which blunts the crack tip and reduces the stress\nsingularity, thermal tempering [3-5] and ion exchange [6] which\ninduce surface compression and so reduce the stress \"felt\" by the\ncrack. A third type of strengthening which is cheaper and easier to\n\n2\n\n\fapply is obtained with coatings : sol-gel derived coatings [7-9]\nand polymeric coatings [10-14] have received attention.\nHypotheses generally presented in these works to explain the\nreinforcement in addition to tip blunting and surface compression\nare energy dissipation at the crack tip for polymers, protection\nagainst water assisted corrosion and crack healing.\nIn this paper an hybrid \"organic/inorganic\" coating based on\norganosilanes deposited from an aqueous solution with more than\n98% weight of water is studied. A polymeric network is created\nvia epoxy/amine reaction and silanol cross-condensation while\nfilm adhesion is ensured by silane grafting on glass. Mechanical\nstrengthening observed by a flexion test of preindented samples is\ncorrelated to the physico-chemical characteristics of the solution\nand of the film. The results suggests that direct bridging of the\ncrack surfaces accounts for most of the reinforcement in this\nsystem.\n2. Experimental\n2.1 Materials\nWe\n\nuse\n\na\n\nmixture\n\nof\n\nan\n\nepoxysilane\n\n(\u03b3-\n\nglycidoxypropylmethyldiethoxysilane) and an aminosilane (3aminopropyltriethoxysilane) (Table 1).\n\n3\n\n\fThe substrates are 2.9 mm thick soda-lime-silicate float glass\nand cut in (100*30) mm plates.\n\n2.2 Film formation\nThe typical film is deposited by dipping the substrates in an\naqueous silane solution (1.0% wt epoxysilane + 0.3% wt\naminosilane) at a withdrawal rate of 50 cm.min-1. The samples\nare dried from 10 to 30 min in air. This variation in drying time\nresults from the preparation of large series of samples. The\nsamples are then cured at 200\u00b0C for 20 min. Scanning electron\nmicroscopy on cross sections indicate that the film is about 100\nnm thick.\nOther drying times and thermal treatments were also used in\nspecific cases and are mentioned were appropriate.\n2.3 IR studies\nHydrolysis and condensation rates are followed by Fourier\nTransform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy using a middle IR\nsource, a KBr beamsplitter and a MCT detector. Spectra are taken\nat a resolution of 4 cm-1 for 128 scans in the range 4000 to 800\ncm-1.\nThe extent of reaction between amino groups and epoxy rings\nand silanol condensation during film drying and after thermal\n\n4\n\n\ftreatment are monitored by Reflection Absorption Infrared\n(RAIR). The RAIR spectra were obtained by using the same\nspectrometer at an incidence angle of 80\u00b0 and a parallel\npolarization. Spectra are taken at a resolution of 4 cm-1 for 128\nscans in the range 4000 to 800 cm-1. For RAIR, a metallic\nsubstrate is necessary [15-17], so microscope slides coated by a\ngold film about 1 micron thick are used.\n2.4 Film properties\n2.4.1 Adhesion and identification of the interface\nThe double cantilever beam (DCB) test is used to determine the\nadhesion or the cohesion of the film. A joint made of a\nsymmetrical sandwich \"glass/film/glue/film/glass\" is opened by a\nwedge and the opening \u03b4 and the crack length L are measured.\nThe model of Kanninen [18] gives the toughness of the joint :\n\n3Eh 3\n\u03b42\nG=\n16 (L + 0.64h) 4\n\n(2)\n\nwhere h and E are respectively the substrate thickness and the\nsubstrate Young's modulus.\nThe interface of fracture is identified using X-ray Photoelectron\nSpectroscopy (XPS).\n2.4.2 Elastic modulus\n\n5\n\n\fThe Young's modulus of the coating is determined by\nnanoindentation. We used a nanoindenter XP from MTS in\nContinuous Stiffness Measurement (CSM) mode with a\nBerkovich tip. The data are analysed with the Oliver and Pharr\nmethod [19].\n2.5 Tensile strength\nA microindenter is used to create controlled defects. A load of\n10N is held constant for 5 seconds to create Vickers indents. Such\na procedure produces a well characterised and reproducible\nsystem of cracks known as the median/radial and lateral cracks\n[20-23]. The indenter is oriented such that the diagonals of the\nindent are parallel to the edges of the specimen. Following\nindentation, complete removal of residual stresses is obtained by\nannealing the samples at 560\u00b0C for 1 hour and by cooling them\nvery slowly (<1\u00b0.min-1). Semi-elliptical cracks produced by this\nmethod have a surface length of 165 \u00b1 10 \u03bcm and a depth of 55 \u00b1\n5 \u03bcm (Figure 1).\nFailure strengths of coated and uncoated samples are measured\nusing four point bending on a Zwick testing machine. The\nindented side is in tension and an adhesive tape is placed on the\nother side of the samples for retention of broken fragments after\nfailure. The loading rate is 10 mm.min-1.\n\n6\n\n\fFor our semi-elliptical crack, Y=1.47 in equation (1) and c is the\ncrack depth [24].\n3. Results\n3.1 Solution study\nThe hydrolysis of the silanes follows the reaction path :\n\u2261Si-OEt + H2O \u2194 \u2261Si-OH + EtOH\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Et stands for an ethyl group.\nWe studied the hydrolysis of each reagent separately by\nmonitoring the growth of the 1045 cm-1 band which is\ncharacteristic of the ethanol released in equation (1).\nThe hydrolysis of the aminosilane alone at 0.3% wt is very\nquick : 90% of the silane is hydrolysed in 5 min. Indeed, the\npolarized bond N-H permits good solubility in water which\nfavours the hydrolysis of the ethyl groups. Fitting this hydrolysis\nby a kinetics of the first order, f(t)=1-exp(-t/\u03c4), gives a time\nconstant \u03c4 \u22481.6 min (Figure 2).\nIt should be noted that the aminosilane sets the pH of the mixture\nat 10.3. Therefore, the hydrolysis of the epoxysilane at 1.0% wt\nwas studied at two different pH. Although a first order kinetics\ndoes not match the data perfectly at pH=10.3, the 8.0 min time\nconstant at pH=10.3 is significantly larger than at the natural\npH=4.4 (2.8 min). Such a pH dependence is well known [25].\n\n7\n\n\fFrom this observation, we prepare the mixture in the following\nway: the epoxysilane is first prehydrolysed at its natural pH\nduring 5 min, when 80% of the hydrolysis is completed, then the\naminosilane is added.\nThe typical films are dip-coated 25 min after the addition of the\naminosilane, when the hydrolysis of the mixture is complete\naccording to our measurements.\n3.2 Film formation\nIn our system, two kinds of reactions are expected to create a\n\"polymeric\" network : the silanol cross-condensation and the\norganic epoxy/amine reaction. These two reactions may occur\neither during drying or during the thermal treatment. They were\nmonitored by RAIR.\n3.2.1 Spectroscopic features\nThe silanol cross-condensation follows the reaction path :\n\u2261Si-OH + HO-Si\u2261 \u2194 \u2261Si-O-Si\u2261 + H2O\n\n(4)\n\nIt is monitored by the SiOH vibration around 910 cm-1 (Figure\n3). The decrease of the peak indicates the loss of silanol groups.\nThe fraction of unreacted silanol SiOH/SiOHtot upon drying was\nestimated according to:\nSiOH/SiOHtot = A/(Aep+Aam)\n\n8\n\n\fwhere A is the absorbance at 910 cm-1 in the film containing the\nmixture of silanes and Aep and Aam stand for the absorbance at\n910 cm-1 for the film containing only the epoxysilane\n(respectively the aminosilane) at very short drying time. We\nmade the assumption that condensation was negligible at short\ndrying time for the films containing each silane alone. This\nassumption is valid for the epoxysilane, which does not condense\nin solution at its natural pH and condenses only very slowly upon\ndrying (results not shown). It is approximate for the aminosilane,\nwhich is already slightly condensed in solution and for which\ncondensation upon drying has begun even at the early stage of\ndrying.\n\nThe epoxy/amine cross-linking follows the reaction path :\n\n(5)\n\nIn solution, no epoxy/amine reaction was observed. Within the\nfilm, the reaction is monitored by following the epoxy bands\n\n9\n\n\f(3000 and 3057 cm-1) and the amino bands (3300 and 3358 cm-1)\n( Figure 4).\n3.2.2 Condensation and cross-linking\nUpon drying in ambient air, the total amount of silanols in the\nfilm drops to about 15% of its original value within 10 hours.\nHowever, only the final thermal treatment ensures that\ncondensation is complete.\nAfter five hours of drying in air, the amino groups have totally\ndisappeared. Because the solution is formulated with an excess of\nepoxysilane, epoxy groups remain even after thermal treatment\nThis complete reaction of the amino groups suggests a thorough\nmixing and an homogeneous distribution of the silanes, which\ncan react together (Figure 5). In summary, these spectroscopic\nevidences show that a dense network of silanes is obtained.\nAlthough the thermal treatment is necessary to complete the\ncondensation,\n\nroom temperature\n\ndrying\n\nis\n\nsufficient\n\nto\n\npolymerize most of the material.\n\n3.3 Film properties\nTo characterize the film properties, samples dipped in a 30 min\naged solution, dried for 10 to 20 min and cured at 200\u00b0C for 20\nmin were prepared.\n\n10\n\n\f3.3.1 Adhesion and identification of the failure interface\nDCB adhesion tests on these films evidence a high joint\ntoughness. However, the XPS shows that the fracture occurs at\nthe glue/film interface. Calculations based on the Kanninen\nmodel give an interfacial toughness G \u2248 8 J.m-2 (Figure 6). The\ninterfacial toughness reflects the work of adhesion but is not\ndirectly equal to it because of additional plastic dissipation in the\nglue. In the present experimental configuration, we estimate the\nenhancement factor as about four [26]. Thus, we may say that the\nlayer toughness and the layer adhesion is higher than about 2\nJ.m-2. Indeed, silanes were specially chosen for their good\nreactivity with the glass surface silanols, consistent with the good\nadhesion on glass. In the same way, we have seen above that\ncovalent bonds are created within the film in agreement with the\nhigh cohesion energy of the coating.\n3.3.2 Elastic modulus\nNanoindentation was performed on a 100 nm thick film. The\neffective modulus as a function of penetration exhibits the typical\n\"S\" curve for coated substrates (Figure 7). At large penetration,\nthe substrate stiffness is obtained (Eglass \u2248 75 GPa) which signals\nthe absence of delamination, another evidence for good adhesion.\nExtrapolation at low penetration returns the intrinsic film\n\n11\n\n\fmodulus around 6 GPa. Thus, the film modulus is about 10 times\nsmaller than the substrate and somewhat larger than a typical\nepoxy resin (E \u2248 2 GPa).\n3.3.3 water stability\nTo check the water stability of the film, a coating has been\ntested during 2 months by contact angle. The specimen was\nstored in room conditions (20\u00b0C and 40% humidity rate) and was\ntested periodically by contact angle. A constant 65\u00b0 angle was\nobserved which means that the film is rather hydrophobic as\nexpected from the loss of the hydrophilic silanol and amino\ngroups. Water durability and permeability have also been studied\nby transmission FTIR: the coated sample is immersed in\ndeionised water and infrared spectra are recorded daily after\ntaking out the sample of the water bath and blowing it dry with\nnitrogen gas. The OH peak (3400 cm-1) and the CH peaks (2868\nand 2931 cm-1) are monitored (Figure 8). The CH and OH peak\nareas are almost constant, which indicates a good water durability\nand low water permeability of the film.\n3.4 Glass strengthening\nThe rupture stresses measured by flexion tests are displayed on\nFigure 9 for various coatings. In comparison with uncoated (but\nindented and annealed) samples, we observed an improvement of\n\n12\n\n\f75% of the rupture stress for a thermal treatment of 200\u00b0C during\n20 min : for uncoated samples, \u03c3r = 76\u00b12 MPa while \u03c3r = 133\u00b19\nMpa for coated samples. The distributions are narrow which\nproves that the process is highly reproducible.\nMoreover, we observed that no reinforcement is obtained when\neither of the two reagents is applied separately. Finally, for the\nsilane mixture, we observed a reinforcement of 35% for samples\ndried 24 hours in air and a strengthening of 64% for a 20 min\nthermal treatment at 110\u00b0C.\n4. Discussion\nThe different possible mechanisms for glass strengthening will\nbe considered now. We note that the formation of a network is\nclearly necessary for reinforcement. The reagents applied\nseparately cannot form a network. Indeed, a difunctional silane like\nthe epoxysilane polymerises linearly. In the same way, a\ntrifunctional silane like the aminosilane tends to form small\nclusters at basic pH. It is only the mixture of the two silanes which\nforms a cross-linked network.\n4.1 Energy dissipation by plasticity\nJ.B. Denis [27] proves in his thesis work that the reinforcement is\nrelated to the yield stress of the coating. In his case, he deals with\nepoxy resins which present long chains able to deform plastically.\n\n13\n\n\fOur system is characterized by short chains and is highly cross\nlinked : it is rather a brittle material. It seems improbable that such\nstrengthening by plasticity may occur here.\n4.2 Thermal stresses\nThis mechanism suggests that thermal compressive stresses\ngenerated by the coating in the glass surface induce the\nstrengthening. Following Hand et al. [11], to obtain the balancing\ncompressive stress in the glass, we assume that the stresses in both\nthe coating (which coats both sides of the glass) and the substrate\nare uniformly distributed, in which case the stress in the substrate\nis given by :\n\u03c3=\u2212\n\nE coating\n\n2t coating\n\n1 \u2212 \u03bd coating\n\nt glass\n\n(\u03b1 coating \u2212 \u03b1 glass )\u2206T\n\n(6)\n\nwhere E, \u03bd, \u03b1 and t are the Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio,\nthermal expansion coefficient and thickness of the glass substrate\nor coating, \u2206T is the difference in temperature between the curing\ntemperature and room temperature.\nThe thermal expansion coefficient of the coating is unknown.\nAssuming 10-4 \u00b0C-1 as an upper bound, for a thermal expansion\ncoefficient of the glass around 10-5 \u00b0C-1, a Young's modulus of the\ncoating of 6 GPa, a Poisson's ratio of 0.2, \u2206T=200\u00b0C and a\nthickness ratio of 10-4, the compressive stress in the glass is \u2248 0,01\n\n14\n\n\fMPa. This stresses are clearly insufficient to explain the\nstrengthening mainly because of the negligible thickness of the\nfilm.\n4.3 Water protection\nThe water corrosion of glass is a well established phenomenon\n[28-31]. The classical theory involves the chemical reaction of\nwater with silica which is the reverse of equation (4).\nSuch behaviour is very important in static fatigue of glass when\nK<Kc : on soda-lime glass, the sub-critical crack growth has been\ndescribed in details. It was shown that the water partial pressure\nhas an impact on the sub-critical crack velocity but not on the Kc\n[31].\nIn our study, we deal with an hydrophobic film which can locally,\nat the crack tip, decrease the amount of water. However, since\nwater has a minor effect on Kc, the increase of Kc we observe is\nnot due to a water barrier effect, although protection against\ncorrosion may be present.\n4.4 Crack healing\nCrack healing results from the presence of tensile stresses within\nthe crack. These closure stresses reduce the stress intensity factor\nat the crack tip as\nK coated = K uncoated + K closure\n\n15\n\n(7)\n\n\fwhere the negative stress intensity factor resulting from the closure\nstresses is\n\nK closure = 2Y'\n\nc c \u03c3(x)\ndx\n\u222b\n\u03c0 0 c2 \u2212 x 2\n\n(8)\n\nY' is a geometric factor and \u03c3(x) the (negative) closure stress\ndistribution.\nWe discuss the possible origins for these closure stresses.\n4.4.1 Thermal mismatch\nFollowing Hand et al. [11], we can consider a closure stress\ngenerated within the crack by thermal expansion mismatch stresses\nbetween the coating and the glass. If we consider that\n\n\u03c3 closure = \u2212\n\nE coating\n1 \u2212 \u03bd coating\n\n(\u03b1 coating - \u03b1 glass )\u2206T\n\n(9)\n\nWith our previous estimates of the thermal coefficient, the closure\nstresses have an order of magnitude consistent with the observed\nvalue. However, in this mechanism, the closure stresses and the\nclosure stress intensity factor are directly proportional to the\ntemperature difference \u2206T. In this case, we would expect the\nreinforcement to drop by a factor of 2 for the 110 \u00b0C thermal\ntreatment and to vanish when the film is cross-linked at room\ntemperature. This is in contradiction with the observed values: the\nreinforcement is almost unaffected when the thermal treatment\n\n16\n\n\ftemperature is reduced to 110 \u00b0C, and is still significant for room\ntemperature drying. This leads to the conclusion that thermal\nmismatch between the coating and the glass is not the dominant\nmechanism for closure stresses in the present system.\n4.4.2 Elastic healing\n\nAnother mechanism for the generation of closure stresses is the\nelastic response of the material filling the crack, or crack face\nbridging. A simple approximate model is now developed to\naccount for this effect.\nIf we assume a linear edge crack with a uniform remote loading\n\u03c30 normal to the crack (Figure 10), this loading gives rise to a\ndisplacement of the crack faces [32] :\nu\u2248\u2212\n\nwith r = c-x and E* =\n\nK 2r\nE* \u03c0\n\nE glass\n1 \u2212 \u03bd glass 2\n\n(10)\n\nin plane strain.\n\nIf the crack is filled with a perfectly elastic material with an\noedometric modulus E, then the displacement u induces a\ndeformation of the filling materials, which in turn exerts a stress on\nthe crack faces. To estimate this closure stress, we would need to\nknow the crack shape, which is not possible. We therefore simply\n\n17\n\n\fassume that the crack has a constant width h. Then, the\ndeformation is u/h and the stress distribution inside the crack is\n\n\u03c3 ( x) =\n\nE u (x)\nh\n\n(11)\n\nAs a result the remote loading \u03c30 induces a stress intensity factor K\nwhich obeys the self-consistency equation\nK closure = \u2212 \u03b2K coated\n\nwith \u03b2 =\n\nE c\n(12)\nE* h\n\n4 2 ( 2 \u2212 1)\nY'\n\u03c0\n\nFinally, combining equations (7), (8), (10) and (11) gives\n\nK coated =\n\nK uncoated\nE c\n1+ \u03b2\nE* h\n\n(13)\n\nDefining the crack form factor as c/h and the modulus ratio as\nE/E*, a crack with a form factor of 10 and a modulus ratio of 0.1 \u2013\nwhich are reasonable estimates in our case \u2013 will exhibit a 60 %\nstress intensity factor drop. Although this simple model is\napproximate because equation (8) will lose its validity when the\nclosure stresses increase and because the exact crack shape is\nunknown, it shows that this bridging mechanism provides a\nconsistent explanation for the reinforcement of glass by a soft\ncrack filling material.\n\n18\n\n\f5. Conclusions\n\nIndented glass coated with an epoxysilane/aminosilane film of\n100 nm thickness exhibits a significant increase in strength of 75%.\nThe film, which has a 6 GPa Young's modulus, shows a good\nadhesion. The low water permeability of the film indicates that the\nfilm may act as a water barrier against environmental corrosion for\nsub-critical crack growth. However this mechanism cannot be\nresponsible for the observed increase of the critical rupture stress.\nWe have shown that closure stresses generated within the crack by\nthermal expansion mismatch stresses between the coating and the\nglass play a minor role in the reinforcement, and that closure\nstresses generated within the crack by the elastic response of the\nfilling\n\nmaterial\n\nare\n\nprobably\n\nthe\n\ndominant\n\nstrengthening\n\nmechanism in the present system.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors are grateful to Dr S.
