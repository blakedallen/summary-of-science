Ciborowski1 , Jakub Rembieli\u0144ski2\nNovember 17, 2018\n\n1\n\nUniversity of Warsaw, Department of Physics, Ho\u017ca 69, 00-681 Warszawa, Poland,\ncib@fuw.edu.pl\n2\n\nUniversity of Lodz, Department of Theoretical Physics, Pomorska 149/153,\n90-236 Lodz, Poland, jaremb@uni.lodz.pl\n\nAbstract: We argue that the result quoted by the OPERA Collaboration cannot be\ninterpreted as simply related to the muon neutrino moving at a superluminal velocity from\nthe point of creation at CERN to the point of interaction at LNGS.\n\nThe OPERA Collaboration have conducted time-of-flight measurements of the muon neutrino velocity and found it exceeding the velocity of light in vacuum, c [1]. The neutrinos\nwere apparently found travelling the distance of 730 km in time shorter by 60 ns than light\nwould do. While the detailed examination of their experimental procedure is ongoing in the\ncommunity, we wish to present comments regarding the physical interpretation of the above\nresult.\nHypothetical particles that would move with velocities higher than c have been named\ntachyons. The Einstein special relativity theory (SR) is not the proper framework for describing tachyons. Direct application of the SR formulae to space-like trajectories leads to negative\nenergies as well as causality violation. As was mentioned many years ago by Sudarshan [2],\na causal description of superluminal particles demands absolute simultaneity for space-time\nevents or, equivalently, a preferred frame of reference. Consequently, such a description must\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nnecessarily break the fundamental paradigm of the special relativity, namely the relativity\nprinciple. In common opinion, this must leads to breaking of the Lorentz invariance, which\nis the fundamental symmetry in physics. However it was shown by one of us [3] that it is\npossible to preserve Lorentz covariance in a theory with a preferred frame. This is achieved\nby choosing the absolute synchronisation procedure instead that of Einstein's and allows\ntachyons to be incorporated in that framework. The freedom in the use of different synchronisation schemes in SR follows from the fact that only the velocity of light over closed paths\ncan be measured without any assumed synchronisation conventions for clocks. The theory [3]\nenables quantisation of tachyon fields free of causal paradoxes as well as vacuum instability\n(i.e. spontaneous particle creation from the vacuum). This formalism applied to light or\nslower than light particles is completely equivalent to that of SR with the Einstein clock synchronisation procedure. It should be stressed then that a discovery of a tachyon would not\ninvalidate nor even modify the Einstein's theory in the subluminal sector, as is notoriously\nclaimed. The velocity of light in vacuum, the limiting velocity in Nature, remains such for\nboth types of particles: massive particles cannot be accelerated above it and tachyons cannot\nbe decelerated below it. In the context of the OPERA measurement it has to be noted that\nthe theoretical framework for describing tachyons [3] can be applied to a direct measurement\nof superluminal velocities on the classical level in the Einstein synchronisation scheme too.\nThis is relevant for further discussion since the GPS system used in the OPERA experiment\nworks exactly in this scheme of clock synchronisation.\nHaving set the theoretical background, we now turn to discuss the quantitative result of\nthe OPERA Collaboration. The measurement for both neutrinos and light involves two\nspace points in the reference frame of the Earth: the point of creation of the neutrino at\nCERN and its interaction point at LNGS. Even if the Earth was in motion with respect to\nthe hypothetical preferred frame, this fact would not influence the following considerations.\nAs was mentioned above, the time-of-flight of the neutrino from the point of production\nto the point of interaction has been measured using the Einstein synchronisation procedure\nassuming the isotropy of propagation of light. The length measurement, L = 730 km, is\nsynchronisation independent. The velocity of the neutrino (below we put c = 1), computed\nby the time-of-flight method, has also been calculated in the Einstein synchronisation: v =\n1 + 2.48 \u00d7 10\u22125 since in that convention the time interval was determined; the average energy\nof the neutrino beam was 17 GeV [1]. The energy, E, of the tachyonic neutrino is related to\nits (tachyonic) mass, \u03ba, and velocity, v, through:\nE=\u221a\n\n\u03ba\n\u03ba\n\u2248\u221a\n,\n\u22121\n2\u2206v\n\nv2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u2206v = v \u2212 1. The above formula is the consequence of the Lorentz covariant definition\nof the four-momentum, p\u03bc = \u03ba w\u03bc , where w\u03bc is the space-like four-velocity of a tachyon,\nnormalised as: w\u03bc w\u03bc = \u22121. The dispersion relation for tachyons has the following form:\nE 2 \u2212 ~p2 = \u2212\u03ba2 . Formula (1) leads to the following result for the tachyonic mass of the\nmuon neutrino: \u03ba \u2248 120 MeV. Neither the beam energy (0-th component of the covariant\nenergy-momentum four-vector) nor the tachyonic mass (a Lorentz invariant) would depend\non the synchronisation procedure. On the other hand, the muon neutrino mass squared has\nbeen determined from the kinematics of the pion decay at rest: \u03c0 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc . The last quoted\nmeasurement is that of Assamagan et al. (1996) which yielded m2\u03bd = \u22120.016\u00b10.023 MeV2 [4].\n\n\fREFERENCES\n\nThis value muon neutrino mass squared was determined from the formula:\nq\nm2\u03bd = m2\u03c0 + m2\u03bc \u2212 2m\u03c0 m2\u03bc + k\u03bc2 ,\n\n3\n\n(2)\n\nwhere k\u03bc = 29.79200 \u00b1 0.00011 MeV is the muon momentum measured in the spectrometer.\nThus the result of the OPERA Collaboration, \u03ba2 \u2248 0.014 GeV2 , is entirely incompatible with\nthe measurement of Assamagan et al.. We are thus led to a conclusion, with the reservation\nfollowing below, that the effect seen by the OPERA Collaboration cannot be interpreted in\nterms of the muon neutrino moving faster than light from the point of creation to the point\nof interaction. Assuming the tachyonic mass according to the result of Assamagan et al.\none obtains an illustrative result that a neutrino with such a mass should arrive 7 \u00d7 10\u221214 s\nearlier than light after a distance of 730 km, far beyond any possibility of measurement. The\nabove statement is true assuming that the OPERA Collaboration detects muon neutrinos\nthat move directly form the point of creation at CERN to the point of detection at LNGS\nwithout undergoing any processes in flight. A tachyon t, however, may decay in number of\nexotic channels, for example: t \u2192 t\u03b3 and t \u2192 t t1 t\u03041 , where \u03b3 denotes the photon and t1 t\u03041\n\u2013 a tachyon-antitachyon pair (including the case t \u2261 t1 ) [5]. It is up to a detailed analysis\nwhether the latter complex process might deliver a clue to the observed effect with t1 being\na tachyonic neutrino with a large tachyonic mass (i.e. higher velocity at a given energy),\nsubsequently decaying into the muon neutrino that is detected at the end.\nLast but not least let us mention that we have considered the hypothesis of the tachyonic\nelectron neutrinos in the context of the mass measurement using the tritium decay [6]. In\nthe quoted paper we presented calculations of the shape of the electron energy spectrum that\nexplained the observed excess of counts near the end-point. For that reason this hypothesis will be confronted with the new measurement which is in preparation by the KATRIN\nCollaboration [7].\n\nReferences\n[1] The OPERA Collaboration, T.
