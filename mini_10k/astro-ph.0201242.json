Introduction\nIn the cores of many clusters of galaxies, X-ray imaging\ndata show a highly peaked surface brightness profile (e.g.\nFabian et al. 1981). The radiative cooling time in these\nregions is much less than a Hubble time. Without a heating process, the gas cools to low temperature and results\nin a \"cooling flow\" (Fabian 1994 for a review). The mass\nflow rate, \u1e40 , that is deduced in the standard cooling flow\nmodel, is approximately proportional to the radius. This\nimplies that matter is deposited throughout the entire\ncooling flow region. It also implies that the gas in the\ncooling flow zone is \"multi-phase\" on scales small enough\nthat the inhomogeneities have escaped the observation so\nfar.\nASCA and ROSAT observations confirmed the existence of cooler gas in the cores of cooling flow clusters\nas expected (e.g. Allen & Fabian 1994, Ikebe et al. 1999,\nIkebe 2001). The presence of an intrinsic absorber in excess of the galactic absorption, as it might be expected\nto arise from the accumulation of cold gas in the cooling\nflows, was also inferred from the analysis of the ASCA\nspectra (e.g. Allen 2000; Allen et al. 2001). In fact, the\nfitting of the \"multi-phase\" cooling flow model to the observed spectra including temperature phases that cool below the X-ray emitting temperature regime, requires the\ninclusion of excess absorption to satisfactorily reproduce\nthe observed spectra. It has also been argued, that inclusion of excess absorption leads to values of the mass flow\nrate as obtained from imaging data, \u1e40I in good agreement\nwith those obtained from spectral analysis, \u1e40S (Allen\n2000).\nHowever, without assuming excess absorption, the values of \u1e40S are systematically lower than \u1e40I (e.g. Ikebe\net al. 1999; Makishima et al. 2001). Instead of the cooling flow model, a two temperature spectral model can\nwell fit ASCA spectra of the cooling flow clusters. The\ntemperatures of the softer component are about half of\nthe hotter component (Ikebe 2001). The central temperatures of some cD galaxies obtained with the ROSAT PSPC\nSend offprint requests to: K. Matsushita\n\nare close to those obtained from normal elliptical galaxies with the same stellar velocity dispersion (Matsushita\n2001). Since cooling flow clusters always possess central\ndominant galaxies, the cool components may reflect the\npotential structure, rather than cooling gas (Ikebe et al.\n1999, Makishima et al. 2001, Ikebe 2001).\nRecently, it was discovered with the RGS instrument\nonboard XMM-Newton that there is little X-ray emission\nfrom a component with a temperature below a certain\nlower cutoff value that differs from object to object (e.g.\nTamura et al. 2001; Kaastra et al. 2001). However, with\nthe RGS one observes only the very central part of the\ncluster.\nM 87 is the cD galaxy of the nearest rich cluster of\ngalaxies, the Virgo Cluster. It is very luminous in X-rays,\nand is suggested to have a \"cooling flow\" with \u1e40 of about\n10 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (Stewart et al. 1984; Fabian et al. 1984). M 87\nalso hosts a central active galactic nuclei (AGN). The radio emission is complex and there are two strong lobe\nstructures (e.g. B\u00f6hringer et al. 1995). An enhancement of\nthe X-ray emission around the lobes was discovered with\nthe EINSTEIN HRI (Feigelson et al. 1987) and ROSAT\nPSPC (B\u00f6hringer et al. 1995)\nIn addition to the XMM RGS results mentioned above,\nthe XMM-Newton observatory offers the possibility to\nperform a very detailed spectral and spatial analysis of\nthe cooling flow area. This is in particular important\nsince the RGS spectrum taken at the very central part of\nthe intracluster medium (ICM) may be strongly affected\nby resonance line scattering and thus the interpretation\nof the results requires the combined analysis of spectra\ntaken at different radii from the center. Early results of\nthe XMM observation of M 87 have already been published (B\u00f6hringer et al. 2001; Belsole et al. 2001). The projected spectrum is fitted with a single temperature model\n(B\u00f6hringer et al. 2001). The abundance drop at the central\nregion is interpreted as resonance scattering. The detailed\nspectral analysis on the jets and the radio lobe structure\nis shown in Belsole et al. (2001).\nIn this paper, we report on the more detailed temperature structure using a deprojecting analysis, and apply a\n\n\fKyoko Matsushita et al.: XMM-Newton observation of M87\n\n3\n\nric within 20%, except for the two inner radio lobe regions\nand the first knot in the jet. A luminous point source near\nthe south edge of the detector is excised in the further\nanalysis.\nWe have selected single pattern events. The background spectrum was calculated for all spectra by integrating the Lockman-Hole data (observed in the Revolution 70,71,73,81 for the EPN) in the same detector regions. In the Lockman-Hole field, sources with a luminosity higher than that of the excluded sources from the M 87\nregion are excised. The flare events in the background data\nwere screened in the following way. We made two count\nrate histograms of bin width of 200s, for the corner region\nin the whole energy band, and for the whole detector for\nabove 10 keV. Then, we fitted each histogram with a gaussian, and selected the time within 3 \u03c3 of the mean for both\nhistograms. The total exposure of the background data is\n95ks. We have also screened the M87 data in the same\nway. The exposure times of the EPN are 30ks, 28ks, 27ks,\n30ks for the Chips 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12, respectively.\nThe spectra of each CCD chip are accumulated within\na ring, centered on M 87. Then, we have subtracted the\nbackground and corrected the effect of the vignetting and\nexposure, and summed the spectra within annular regions.\nThe contribution of out-of-time events is subtracted using\nSAS.\nFig. 1. EPN image of M87 in the energy range of 0.2 to\n10.0 keV. The effect of the out-of-time events is corrected.\nThe overlayed contours correspond to the image divided\nby a azimuthally symmetric with the same radial profile,\nsmoothed with 20\u2032\u2032 Gaussian. The contour levels are 0.8,\n0.9 (white), 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 (red). The regions\nsurrounded by the blue contours are excluded from our\nspectral analysis as described in \u00a73.3.\ncooling flow model to the spectral analysis. We employ a\ndistance of M 87 of 17 Mpc. We adopt for the solar iron\nabundance the 'photospheric' value, Fe/H = 4.68 \u00d7 10\u22125\nby number (Anders & Grevesse 1989). Unless otherwise\nspecified, we use 90% confidence error regions.\n2. Observation and data preparation\nM87 was observed with XMM-Newton on June 19th, 2000.\nThe thin filter is used for both detectors.\n2.1. EPN\nFigure 1 shows the X-ray image of M87 obtained with\nthe EPN. The contribution from the out-of-time events is\nsubtracted following the standard analysis package (SAS).\nThe image divided by an azimuthally symmetric image\nwith the same radial profile is overlayed in Figure 1. The\nX-ray halo is very smooth and almost spherically symmet-\n\n2.2. EMOS\nWe have selected events with pattern between 0 to 12. The\nbackground spectra are accumulated from the LockmanHole data observed in Revolution 70. The background flare\nevents are screened in the same way for the EPN. The\nexposure times of the background and data are 33 ks and\n40 ks, respectively. Out-of-time events are not subtracted\nsince the contribution is negligible.\n2.3. Spectral Deprojection\nDeprojected spectra are calculated by subtracting the contribution from the outer shell regions for all spectral components, assuming the ICM is spherically symmetric as\ndone by Nulsen and B\u00f6hringer (1995). Within a each shell,\nthe spectrum per unit volume is assumed to be the same.\nIn order to calculate the deprojected spectrum of the outermost (N th ) shell, we subtracted the emission of the outside of the N th shell using the brightness profile derived\nfrom the ROSAT All Sky Survey (B\u00f6hringer et al. 1994)\nassuming that spectral shape outside the N th shell is the\nsame with that of the N th shell. The deprojected spectrum of the ith shell is then calculated by subtracting the\ncontributions from i + 1th to N th shell and from outside\nof the N th shell from the annular spectrum of the corresponding radius.\n\n\f4\n\nKyoko Matsushita et al.: XMM-Newton observation of M87\n\nFig. 2.

Here, r is the the projected radius. The EMOS gives about 10% higher normalizations\nthan the EPN. The response matrices of the EPN and\nEMOS are mostly consistent. Below 0.5 keV, EPN data\nis lower than the EMOS data, and there are small discrepancies around the tail of the Fe-L lines at 0.8-1.0 keV\nand around the instrumental Si edge at 2 keV. Since the\nEMOS gives a hydrogen column density, NH , consistent\nwith that of ROSAT (c.f. \u00a76), we fitted to the EPN and\nEMOS data in the spectral range of 0.5 to 10 keV and\n0.3 to 10 keV, respectively. For R > 8\u2032 , the energy range\nbetween 7.5 and 8.5 keV of the EPN spectra is ignored,\nbecause of strong instrumental emission lines.\nWe have fitted the spectra for the region with radius\nR > 0.5\u2032 with a MEKAL model with photoelectric absorp-\n\nFig. 3.

For the spectra within 0.5\u2032 , a power-law component, with the same absorption, NH , is added. When fitting the spectra between\n0.12\u2032 and 0.5\u2032 , we fixed the index of the power-law component to the best-fit value obtained from the spectrum\nwithin 0.12\u2032 and normalized it using the Point Spread\nFunction. We grouped several elements and constrained\nthe elements in each group to have a common abundance.\nThe first group is C, N, and O, and the second group is Fe\nand Ni. The other elements are determined separately. We\nalso fitted the spectra with a sum of two MEKAL models, where the two components were constrained to have\ncommon abundances.\nWe have summarized the results in Table 1.\nFigures 3 and 4 show the radial profile of the temperature obtained by the single temperature model, and the\ntwo temperature model, respectively. The temperatures\nderived from the EPN and EMOS are mostly consistent.\nWithin R < 6\u2032 and R < 13.5\u2032 of the EMOS and EPN\nrespectively, the two temperature model gives significantly\nlower \u03c72 values than the single temperature model. The\ntemperature of the cooler component is almost constant\nat \u223c 1 keV, which is the same as the central temperature\nobtained by the single temperature model fit. That of the\nhotter component show a nearly constant value at R < 2\u2032 ,\nwhereas for R > 2\u2032 it increases gradually.

Result of spectrum fitting of the deprojected spectra (whole region)\n\nthe former to be 1.0 keV. The fraction of the cool component is 20% at R=0.5\u2032 and drops below 1 % beyond 6\u2032\nfor the EMOS. Beyond 4\u2032 , the EPN tends to have 1\u20132%\nlarger values of the contribution of the cooler component\nthan the EMOS. This difference reflects the discrepancy\nat 0.8\u20131 keV between the EPN and the EMOS shown in\nFigure 2. This energy band corresponds to an instrumental low-energy tail of the Fe-L lines and the effect for the\nEPN is stronger than that of the EMOS. The EPN has\nan additional uncertainty due to the position dependent\nenergy resolution. Considering that the EMOS spectra of\nR > 6\u2032 at 0.7\u20131.1 keV are well fitted by the single temperature MEKAL model fit, the larger amount of 1 keV\ncomponent observed by EPN may be caused by the uncertainty of the response matrix of the EPN. Thus, there is\na systematic uncertainty of 1\u20132% in the fraction of the 1\nkeV component. In summary, within R < 6\u2032 , we detected\nat least two temperature components and outside R > 6\u2032 ,\nthe upper limit of the second component is less than a few\n% even using the EPN.\n\nASCA spectra of M 87 are also well fitted with a sum\nof two Raymond-Smith models (Raymond & Smith 1977).\nThe temperature of the two components are 3.0 and 1.3\nkeV, and the ratio of the emission measure range from 0.2\nto 2 within 10\u2032 (Matsumoto et al. 1996), although the results of MEKAL model fit with ASCA spectra are mostly\nconsistent when considering the difference in spatial resolution (Finoguenov & Jones 2000; Shibata 2000). The\ncontribution of the cooler component plotted in Figure 5\nis much smaller than that derived from R-S fits.\n3.2. Azimuthal temperature structure\nIn a second step, in order to study the spatial distribution of the temperature components in more detail, the\nEMOS spectra are accumulated within sector regions as\nshown in Figure 6. The spectral fits used two temperature\nMEKAL model. Although the spectra fitted in this section are not the deprojected ones, we can constrain the\nspatial distribution of the temperature structure.

It also shows hardness ratio maps\nfor the energy band ratios 0.6\u20131.2keV/2\u201310keV and 1.0\u2013\n1.2keV/0.8\u20131.0keV. Although the latter is the most sensitive to the 1 keV components (Figure 7), the statistics is\nnot sufficient in the outer regions. The ratios of the emission measure of the cool to hot components are overlayed\non the hardness ratio maps.\nThe hard band image is nearly spherically symmetric\nand no enhancements of the X-ray emission associated to\nthe radio structure is seen. The temperature of the hot\ncomponents is also almost spherically symmetric within\n10%. It tends to be slightly lower in the region around the\nradio lobes.\nIn contrast, the spatial distribution of the cool component is far from symmetry, although its temperature is\ndetermined to have an almost constant value, \u223c 1 keV.\nBelsole et al. (2001) found that the softer regions agree\nwell with the radio structures. Within R <1', the 1 keV\ncomponent is detected from all the spectra, but its contribution ranges from several % to 30 %. In the radial\nzone R=1-2\u2032, where 4 sectors are located outside the radio lobes, we find a signature of the 1 keV component in\ntwo of these sectors but it is absent in the other two. Outside 2\u2032 , we have only detected the 1 keV component from\nthe two sectors containing the radio lobes.\n\nFig. 5. The ratio of emission measure of the cool and hot\ntemperature component, assuming the temperature of the\nformer to be 1.0 keV. The meanings of symbols is the same\nas in Figure 3. The discrepancies between the EPN and\nEMOS may be caused by instrumental problems in the\nEPN (see text).\n\n3.3. Excluding the radio lobe regions\nFor the further analysis, we have filtered regions with excess emission related to the jet and radio lobes. We used a\nspatial filter, excluding those regions where the brightness\nis larger by 15 % than the azimuthally averaged value (Figure 1, 6). The softer regions are not fully excluded within\n2\u2032 , since it is difficult to filter whole the 1 keV component\nwithin 2\u2032 due to its complicated structure and the limited\nspatial resolution of the XMM telescope.\nAssuming spherical symmetry, deprojected spectra are\ncalculated. We also made deprojected spectra with larger\nshell width than those in Table 1. We accumulated spectra\nwithin annular regions again and subtracted the contribution from the outer shells with thin shells width obtained\nbefore. We then fitted the spectra with the single temperature and two temperature MEKAL model, in the same\nway as in \u00a73.1. In the following sections, we will only use\nthe spectra filtered the regions with enhance emissions.\nThe results are summarized in Table 2. After filtering\nthe regions with excess emissions, the emission measure\nof the 1 keV component is reduced (Figure 5), and the\nsingle temperature model gives reasonable fits at R > 2\u2032\n(Table 2; Figure 7). The remaining 1 keV components of\nthe EPN beyond 2\u2032 may be due to the uncertainty of the\ninstrumental low-energy tail of the Fe-L lines.

Any multi-temperature\nmodel cannot explain the residual, because the continuum\nand the Fe-K line are fitted well with a single MEKAL\nmodel. When the Ni abundance is assumed to be a factor\nof 2 larger than Fe in solar units, the residuals become\nsmaller (Finoguenov et al. 2001; Matsushita et al. 2002).\nThis structure may also be due to a problem the Fe-L\natomic data, since the APEC code (Smith et al. 2001) do\nnot need such a high Ni abundance.\n\nThese results indicate that most of the space is occupied by a component which is nearly spherically symmetric. Within relatively small regions associated to the\nradio structures, there is an additional component whose\ntemperature is about 1 keV. In the following sections, we\nwill study the temperature structure in detail using the\nfiltered spectra.\n4. The abundance profile of Fe\nIn spectral fitting the derived temperature and element\nabundances are partly dependents on each other. This is\nparticularly important for the Fe abundance, where the\nspectral features of K- and L-shell lines with their temperature dependent relative importance are fitted simultaneously. A more detailed report on the abundances is\ngiven in Paper II (Matsushita et al. 2002) and Finoguenov\net al.

As derived from the projected spectra (B\u00f6hringer et al. 2001; Finoguenov et al. 2001), the\nFe abundance shows a strong negative gradient (Figure\n\n\f8\n\nKyoko Matsushita et al.: XMM-Newton observation of M87\n\n1T MEKAL\n2T MEKAL\nR\nkT\nNH\n\u03c72 /\u03bca\nkT 1\nkT 2\nNH\n\u03c72 /\u03bc EM2/EM1b\n(arcmin)\n(keV)\n(1020 cm\u22122 )\n(keV)\n(keV)\n(1020 cm\u22122 )\n0.00-0.12\nEPN\n0.69+0.11\n2.0\n(fix)\n49/56\n\u22120.07\n0.12-0.25\nEPN\n0.81+0.15\n9.5+7.5\n35/54\n\u22120.17\n\u22124.3\n+0.09\n0.25-0.35\nEPN\n1.19\u22120.19\n3.0+5.9\n72/54\n\u22122.7\n0.35-0.50\nEPN\n1.48+0.11\n4.7+3.0\n65/54 1.77+0.26\n0.89+0.22\n2.8+3.4\n55/52\n0.139+0.142\n\u22120.10\n\u22122.6\n\u22120.22\n\u22120.17\n\u22122.8\n\u22120.072\n+2.6\n+0.17\n+0.17\n+2.7\n+0.05\n46/52\n0.180+0.116\n2.7\u22122.6\n67/54 1.71\u22120.13 0.84\u22120.10\n5.7\u22121.7\n0.50-0.70\nEPN\n1.36\u22120.05\n\u22120.068\n35/52\n0.085+0.055\n2.3+2.3\n1.05+0.26\n43/54 1.72+0.20\n4.4+1.7\n0.70-1.00\nEPN\n1.49+0.03\n\u22120.043\n\u22122.3\n\u22120.22\n\u22120.17\n\u22121.8\n\u22120.05\n1.00-1.40\nEPN\n1.52+0.07\n4.4+1.6\n35/54 1.64+0.15\n0.91+0.33\n3.3+1.8\n30/52\n0.059+0.043\n\u22120.04\n\u22121.9\n\u22120.11\n\u22120.26\n\u22122.0\n\u22120.039\n1.12+0.42\n1.7+2.1\n46/52\n0.060+0.040\n1.40-2.00\nEPN\n1.58+0.06\n3.4+1.7\n56/54 1.82+8.72\n\u22120.030\n\u22120.08\n\u22121.7\n\u22120.18\n\u22120.27\n\u22121.7\n2.00-2.80\nEPN\n1.85+0.09\n2.0+1.2\n35/54\n0.008+0.020\n\u22120.09\n\u22121.2\n\u22120.008\n2.80-4.00\nEPN\n2.03+0.09\n2.2+1.0\n70/54\n0.011+0.016\n\u22120.09\n\u22120.9\n\u22120.011\n4.00-5.60\nEPN\n2.14+0.10\n1.9+0.8\n74/54 2.20+0.12\n1.0 (fix)\n1.5+1.0\n65/53\n0.018+0.015\n\u22120.09\n\u22121.1\n\u22120.11\n\u22121.0\n\u22120.015\n+10.2\n+11.461\n0.0-0.25\nEPN\n0.87+0.07\n5.8+1.2\n53/54 1.21+0.61\n0.67+0.10\n2.0\u22122.0\n31/53 3.689\u22123.233\n\u22120.05\n\u22122.8\n\u22120.23\n\u22120.36\n0.25-0.50\nEPN\n1.35+0.06\n5.5+1.9\n76/54 1.66+0.15\n0.82+0.10\n3.1+2.0\n47/51\n0.173+0.088\n\u22120.06\n\u22121.7\n\u22120.13\n\u22120.09\n\u22122.3\n\u22120.064\n+0.02\n+1.6\n+0.11\n+0.13\n+1.4\n0.50-1.00\nEPN\n1.47\u22120.04\n4.5\u22121.0\n84/54 1.72\u22120.10 0.97\u22120.12\n2.3\u22121.4\n49/52\n0.119+0.040\n\u22120.030\n1.00-2.00\nEPN\n1.55+0.05\n4.1+0.9\n71/54 1.74+0.16\n1.03+0.26\n2.3+1.2\n51/52\n0.060+0.022\n\u22120.04\n\u22121.1\n\u22120.09\n\u22120.17\n\u22121.2\n\u22120.020\n91/54\n0.009+0.010\n2.2+0.6\n2.00-4.00\nEPN\n1.97+0.06\n\u22120.009\n\u22120.6\n\u22120.05\n0.00-0.12 EMOS 1.08+0.26\n3.4+2.2\n113.6/120\n\u22120.23\n\u22122.4\n0.12-0.25 EMOS 0.95+0.05\n4.6+1.0\n130.9/120\n\u22120.05\n\u22120.9\n+0.03\n0.25-0.35 EMOS 1.08\u22120.06\n4.8+2.1\n107.5/120\n\u22122.0\n100.4/114\n0.098+0.079\n0.9+1.6\n1.02+0.28\n117.6/116 1.83+0.33\n4.0+1.6\n0.35-0.50 EMOS 1.53+0.09\n\u22120.051\n\u22120.4\n\u22120.16\n\u22120.20\n\u22121.6\n\u22120.07\n+1.3\n+0.12\n+0.27\n+1.1\n+0.02\n111.1/114\n0.179+0.050\n2.1\u22121.3\n149.0/116 1.83\u22120.13 1.08\u22120.08\n4.4\u22120.7\n0.50-0.70 EMOS 1.38\u22120.04\n\u22120.040\n93.0/114\n0.088+0.028\n2.0+1.1\n0.90+0.20\n118.1/116 1.71+0.09\n3.9+0.7\n0.70-1.00 EMOS 1.51+0.04\n\u22120.024\n\u22121.0\n\u22120.10\n\u22120.11\n\u22121.4\n\u22120.04\n1.00-1.40 EMOS 1.56+0.05\n3.4+0.5\n118.0/116 1.66+0.14\n0.86+0.34\n2.4+1.0\n110.0/114\n0.050+0.023\n\u22120.06\n\u22121.2\n\u22120.06\n\u22120.16\n\u22121.0\n\u22120.021\n1.0 (fix)\n2.1+1.0\n99.5/114\n0.035+0.021\n1.40-2.00 EMOS 1.59+0.06\n2.9+0.9\n103.3/116 1.68+0.08\n\u22120.020\n\u22120.04\n\u22120.9\n\u22120.06\n\u22121.0\n2.00-2.80 EMOS 1.96+0.07\n1.9+0.6\n112.4/116\n0.019+0.011\n\u22120.09\n\u22120.8\n\u22120.010\n1.2+0.5\n121.3/116\n0.000+0.007\n2.80-4.00 EMOS 2.10+0.05\n\u22120.000\n\u22120.06\n\u22120.4\n116.4/116\n0.008+0.008\n1.1+0.4\n4.00-5.60 EMOS 2.19+0.05\n\u22120.008\n\u22120.4\n\u22120.05\n0.00-0.25 EMOS 0.95+0.09\n4.0+0.6\n176.9/120 1.50+0.30\n0.72+0.08\n2.2+0.7\n104.2/114\n0.488+2.953\n\u22120.09\n\u22120.7\n\u22120.10\n\u22120.02\n\u22121.0\n\u22120.276\n0.25-0.50 EMOS 1.37+0.04\n4.6+1.0\n153.6/120 1.68+0.02\n0.95+0.05\n2.7+0.7\n113.7/114\n0.194+0.062\n\u22120.04\n\u22121.0\n\u22120.08\n\u22120.05\n\u22120.6\n\u22120.041\n+0.4\n+0.06\n+0.14\n+0.7\n0.50-1.00 EMOS 1.46+0.01\n4.2\n196.4/116\n1.74\n0.96\n2.0\n112.4/114\n0.112+0.013\n\u22120.01\n\u22120.5\n\u22120.04\n\u22120.06\n\u22120.7\n\u22120.020\n135.4/114\n0.042+0.013\n2.2+0.5\n1.05+0.25\n150.2/116 1.69+0.11\n3.1+0.5\n1.00-2.00 EMOS 1.58+0.01\n\u22120.013\n\u22120.6\n\u22120.15\n\u22120.09\n\u22120.4\n\u22120.02\n171.8/116\n0.005+0.005\n1.5+0.3\n2.00-4.00 EMOS 2.05+0.03\n\u22120.005\n\u22120.4\n\u22120.04\n168.2/116\n0.005+0.005\n1.6+0.2\n4.00-8.00 EMOS 2.30+0.04\n\u22120.005\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.04\na: degrees of freedom\nb: Ratio of emission measure of the cooler and hotter component, when the temperature of the former is fixed to 1 keV.\n\nTable 2. Result of spectrum fitting of the deprojected spectra (regions with the enhanced X-ray emission associated\nto the radio structures are excluded)\n\n8 ). The two temperature MEKAL fit gives significantly\nlarger abundances than the single temperature MEKAL\nfit, although the contributions of the cooler component are\nsmall. For example, at R=0.5-1', including of 10 % of the\ncooler component in units of emission measure changes Fe\nabundances by a factor 2. The reason for this is the change\nof the temperature of the hot component, when the cold\ncomponent is added, e.g. in the ring taken as an example\nthe temperature of the main component increases from\n1.47 to 1.72 keV. For a fixed Fe line feature this leads to a\nhigher abundance required in the fit. As a result, the central abundance drop which is seen in the single MEKAL\nfit is not seen in the result of the two MEKAL fit. This will\nbe discussed further in paper II (Matsushita et al. 2002).\n\n5. Detailed temperature structure\n5.1. Temperatures obtained from the Fe-L and the hard\nenergy band\nThere are some problems in the determination of the temperature through X-ray spectral fitting. The first problem\nis resonant line scattering, which should be important in\nthe core of M 87 (Shigeyama 1998, B\u00f6hringer et al. 2001).\nThe second problem is the uncertainties in the Fe-L atomic\ndata (e.g. Masai 1977; Matsushita et al. 2000). The major\nuncertainty is the ionization and recombination rates of\nFe, which may change resulting temperature by 20\u201330%.\n(Masai 1997; Matsushita et al. 2000). In order to avoid\nthese problems, we exclude the Fe-L region below 1.6 keV\nand fit the spectra again. In addition, to compare the temperature obtained to those from the Fe-L lines, we also fit-\n\n\fKyoko Matsushita et al.: XMM-Newton observation of M87\n\n9\n\nFig. 8. Deprojected Fe profile of the EPN (crosses)\nand EMOS (diamonds) fitted with a single temperature\nMEKAL model (black) and the two temperature MEKAL\nmodel (gray).\n\nFig. 7. Deprojected spectra of the EPN (lobes excluded).\nThe spectrum at R < 0.12\u2032 is fitted with the double component model, consisting a MEKAL model and a powerlaw component and those of R=0.5-1.0\u2032 and 1.0-2.0\u2032 are\nfitted with a two component MEKAL model. Each component is plotted in dashed lines. The other spectra are\nfitted with a MEKAL model. The bottom panels show\nresiduals of the fit.\n\nted the data between 0.7 to 1.3 keV with a single temperature MEKAL or Raymond-Smith model (hereafter R-S\nmodel). The R-S model is used for the comparison with\nthe ASCA results.\nThe result is summarized in Table 3 and Figures 9.\nThe derived temperatures using the hard energy band,\nkThard , of the EPN and EMOS are consistent with each\nother (Table 3). At R > 2\u2032 , they are consistent to those\nobtained using the whole energy band and within R=0.35\u2013\n2\u2032 they are consistent to the temperatures of the hotter\ncomponent obtained in \u00a73.1 and 3.3. This indicates that\nwithin R=0.35\u20132\u2032, the 1.7 keV component really exists\nand is the dominant phase in the ICM.\nThe results for the Fe-L region using the MEKAL\nmodel, kTMEKAL, are consistent or slightly higher than\nkThard at R > 1\u2032 because of the residual structure around\n\n\u223c 1.2 keV. Within R < 1\u2032 , kTMEKAL is lower than kThard\ndue to the contributions from the 1 keV components.\nThe R-S model gives significantly lower temperatures\nthan kThard by \u223c20%. As a result, when fitted with a R-S\nmodel, there remain residuals in the hard energy band. To\nexplain the residuals, we need an additional R-S component with a high temperature, \u223c 3 keV. This is the reason\nof the comparable emission measure of the two temperature R-S components obtained in the ASCA results (Matsumoto et al. 1996)\n5.2. Temperature obtained from line ratios\nThe ratio of He-like K\u03b1 to H-like K\u03b1 line strengths is\nsensitive to the gas temperature. Since the energy resolution of the EMOS is better than that of the EPN, we used\nonly EMOS data here. We fitted the spectra within the energy range of 1.8-2.1 keV, and 2.3-2.7 keV with a MEKAL\nmodel. We denote the temperature obtained from the former energy range as kTSi and from the latter as kTS . The\ncontribution of Fe-L lines at the energy of the He-like K\u03b1\nline of Si is considerable, and the He-like line contains several strong components. The result is summarized in Table\n4.\nFigure 9 also compares the temperatures, kTSi and\nkTS . These temperatures agree well within 10% with the\ndeprojected temperature of the corresponding shell, although kTSi may have some uncertainty, since around the\nSi He-K lines, Fe-L and Ni-L lines are also important. Furthermore, there is an instrumental Si edge in the response\nmatrix and a strong instrumental Si line, which may cause\n\n\f10\n\nKyoko Matsushita et al.: XMM-Newton observation of M87\n\nEPN\nEMOS\nkTR\u2212S b\nR\nkThard a\nkThard a\nkTMEKAL b\n(arcmin)\n(keV)\n(keV)\n(keV)\n(keV)\n+0.04\n1.01\n0.00-0.12\n1.08+0.37\n\u22120.02\n\u22120.27\n+0.05\n1.01+0.03\n0.12-0.25\n1.03\u22120.05\n\u22120.03\n+0.34\n+0.39\n+0.06\n0.25-0.35\n1.06\u22120.38 1.60\u22120.36\n1.11\u22120.06\n1.06+0.03\n\u22120.04\n0.35-0.50\n1.78+0.52\n1.64+0.18\n1.59+0.11\n1.38+0.04\n\u22120.38\n\u22120.17\n\u22120.09\n\u22120.05\n0.50-0.70\n1.61+0.16\n1.68+0.11\n1.41+0.03\n1.24+0.03\n\u22120.15\n\u22120.11\n\u22120.04\n\u22120.07\n0.70-1.00\n1.59+0.18\n1.60+0.10\n1.55+0.07\n1.33+0.04\n\u22120.16\n\u22120.10\n\u22120.05\n\u22120.03\n1.39+0.02\n1.68+0.08\n1.55+0.10\n1.00-1.40\n1.68+0.18\n\u22120.03\n\u22120.09\n\u22120.10\n\u22120.17\n1.39+0.03\n1.73+0.09\n1.58+0.10\n1.40-2.00\n1.74+0.21\n\u22120.03\n\u22120.10\n\u22120.10\n\u22120.15\n1.45+0.12\n2.09+0.16\n1.98+0.09\n2.00-2.80\n1.89+0.15\n\u22120.02\n\u22120.15\n\u22120.09\n\u22120.14\n2.80-4.00\n2.12+0.14\n2.05+0.07\n2.10+0.15\n1.53+0.11\n\u22120.13\n\u22120.07\n\u22120.12\n\u22120.09\n4.00-5.60\n2.22+0.21\n2.15+0.08\n2.58+0.32\n1.65+0.11\n\u22120.14\n\u22120.08\n\u22120.25\n\u22120.13\n5.60-8.00\n2.41+0.16\n2.29+0.12\n2.46+0.23\n1.71+0.09\n\u22120.15\n\u22120.07\n\u22120.19\n\u22120.11\n8.00-11.30 2.74+0.21\n2.47+0.09\n2.80+0.34\n1.81+0.29\n\u22120.19\n\u22120.09\n\u22120.28\n\u22120.11\n2.04+0.13\n2.65+0.23\n2.61+0.06\n11.3-13.50 2.58+0.36\n\u22120.14\n\u22120.19\n\u22120.05\n\u22120.30\n13.5-16.00 2.55+0.20\n\u22120.18\na: kT obtained by fitting the spectra above 1.6 keV.\nb: kT obtained by fitting the spectra between 0.7 to 1.3 keV.\n\nR\n(arcmin)\n0.25-0.50\n0.50-1.00\n1.00-2.00\n2.00-4.00\n4.00-8.00\n8.00-11.30\na: degrees of\n\n1.8-2.1keV\nkTSi\n(keV)\n1.28+0.21\n\u22120.16\n1.47+0.13\n\u22120.11\n1.58+0.15\n\u22120.11\n1.85+0.17\n\u22120.14\n1.99+0.23\n\u22120.16\n2.01+0.60\n\u22120.30\nfreedom\n\n\u03c72 /\u03bca\n19.2/19\n9.3/19\n17.5/19\n12.8/19\n9.0/19\n12.7/19\n\n2.3-2.8keV\nkTS\n(keV)\n1.54+0.38\n\u22120.42\n1.65+0.15\n\u22120.15\n1.55+0.13\n\u22120.13\n1.95+0.11\n\u22120.10\n2.21+0.15\n\u22120.12\n2.78+1.26\n\u22120.52\n\n\u03c72 /\u03bca\n18.4/31\n14.6/31\n31.2/31\n20.4/31\n23.0/31\n19.9/31\n\nTable 4.

Deprojected EMOS spectrum within R=1-2.8\u2032\nin the energy range of Si and S lines, fitted with a MEKAL\nmodel (black line) or 1.4 keV + 3.3 keV R-S model (gray\nline).\n\nFig. 9. Deprojected radial profile of the temperature obtained with EMOS, by fitting the spectra of 0.7\u20131.3 keV\n(black diamonds), above 1.6 keV (black crosses), 1.8-2.1\nkeV (gray crosses) and 2.3-2.7 keV (gray diamonds) with\na MEKAL model. The results obtained by R-S model using 0.7\u20131.3 keV are also shown (dotted diamonds). The\nsolid line corresponds to the best fit regression line for\nthe MEKAL model using the whole energy band of the\nEMOS.\n\nthe discrepancy between the EPN and EMOS at 2 keV\nshown in Figure 2.\nWe also compare the model and data spectra of the\nSi and S region in Figure 10. The two temperature R-\n\nS model with the same abundance ratio, cannot fit the\nSi and S line ratios, while a single temperature MEKAL\nmodel fits the lines well. In order to explain the observed\nline ratios with the two component R-S model, the harder\nspectral component should have an abundance of Si and\nS a factor of 3 \u223c 5 larger than the softer component.\nSince the deprojected data have larger uncertainties,\nwe have also used the S line ratios of the annular spectra.\nThe strength of the K\u03b1 lines are obtained by fitting the\nannular spectra within 2.2\u20132.8 keV with a bremsstrahlung\nand two gaussians. We calculated the projected S line ratio\nusing the deprojected temperature and density (\u00a77) profiles and compared with the observed ones. We used two\ntemperature relations derived in \u00a73.3. One is the best fit\nrelation of the single MEKAL model fit and the other relation is derived when we adopted the hotter component\ntemperature of the two temperature MEKAL fit within\nR < 2\u2032 . Outside 1\u2032 , the observed ratios agree well with the\ncalculated profiles from single temperature model fit (Fig-\n\n\fKyoko Matsushita et al.: XMM-Newton observation of M87\n\nFig. 11. Projected line ratios (EMOS) between K\u03b1 of\nhydrogen and helium like S (closed circles). Errors correspond to 68% confidence level. The solid and dashed\nlines represent the results using the observed temperature\nprofile from the single temperature MEKAL model and\nthat of the hotter component from the two temperature\nMEKAL model, respectively. The assumed radial temperature profiles are written in the figure. We also plotted the\nprofile for temperatures shifted by 10% (dotted line)\n\nure 11). Comparing these results with a profile calculated\nusing a temperature profile shifted by 10% to the data, we\ncan conclude that the temperature profile inferred from\nthe observed S line ratios is consistent within several %\nwith the deprojected temperature profile. Within 1\u2032 , the\nobserved ratios are close to with those calculated using\nthe hotter component temperature of the two temperature MEKAL fit, but smaller than those from the single\ntemperature fit. This result indicates that S lines are dominated by those of the hotter component within 2\u2032 .\nWe then compared the strength of the Fe-L and Fe-K\nlines as follows. As for the S line ratios, the line brightness\nprofile of Fe-K is calculated using the deprojected results.\nWithin 2\u2032 , we adopted the Fe abundance obtained from\nthe two temperature model fit. The Fe abundance from the\ndeprojected data is mainly determined from the Fe-L lines.\nFor a given temperature, this analysis gives a comparison\nbetween the Fe-L and Fe-K spectral signatures. Outside\n0.5\u2032 , the observed profile of Fe-K is only 20% larger than\nthe calculated profile (Figure 12). Since the Fe-L atomic\ndata may have uncertainties of 20-30% (e.g. Masai et al.\n1998; Matsushita et al. 2001), the difference may be due to\nthe uncertainties in the Fe-L atomic data. If the difference\nis caused by the temperature structure, it is explained by\nonly 10% larger temperatures.\n\n11\n\nFig. 12. The projected radial profile of the line brightness of Fe-K\u03b1 of the EMOS (open circles) and the EPN\n(crosses). The solid and dashed lines represent the results\nusing the temperature profile from the single temperature\nMEKAL model and that of the hotter component from the\ntwo temperature MEKAL model, respectively. The dotted\nlines corresponds to 10% higher temperatures. Errors represent the 68 % confidence level.\nIn summary, excluding the regions associated to the\nradio structures, at R>1\u2032 , kThard , kTSi and kTS of a given\ndeprojected spectrum agree within 10%. kTMEKAL also\nagrees well with kThard , although kTFe\u2212L depends on the\nplasma emission code (e.g Masai 1997). These results indicate that at least at R > 1\u2032 , the ICM at a given radius\nis dominated by a single temperature component whose\ntemperature is 1.7 keV at R=1\u2032 and 2.5 keV at R=15\u2032 .\nThe consistency between Fe-L and Fe-K also supports the\nsingle phase temperature structure. The difference of these\ntemperatures within 1\u2032 reflects that the contribution of the\n1 keV component become significant.\nMoreover, the temperature obtained from the MEKAL\nmodel seems to be reasonable at least in the obtained temperature range, when ignoring the residual structure at 1.2\nkeV.\n5.3. Spectral fits with the APEC plasma code\nA new plasma code, APEC (Smith et al. 2001), is now\navailable in XSPEC. The residual structures around the\nFe-L emission that occurred in the fits with the MEKAL\ncode disappeared with the use of the APEC code for Centaurus clusters (Sanders & Fabian 2001).\nIn this paper, we used the version 1.0 of the APEC in\nthe version 11.0.1 of the XSPEC. In figure 13, we show\nratios of a single temperature plasma with solar abundance calculated with the APEC and MEKAL models,\nwhen observed with the EMOS. Within the energy reso-\n\n\f12\n\nKyoko Matsushita et al.: XMM-Newton observation of M87\n\nFig. 13. Ratio of theoretical spectra of MEKAL to APEC\ncode for a plasma temperature of 1 keV (black solid line), 2\nkeV (gray solid line) and 4 keV (black dashed line) when\nobserved with the EMOS. Abundances are assumed to\nhave solar values.\nlution of the CCD detectors, the dominant change is not\nin the Fe-L lines, but in the K\u03b1 lines. Using the APEC\ncode, the strength of the K\u03b1 lines of hydrogen like ions,\nwhich are the most fundamental lines, decrease by several\ntens of %, and the temperature dependence also changes.\nThe 6.7 keV Fe-K lines decrease, by a factor of 2 at 1 keV\nand 30% at 4 keV. The changes of the K\u03b1 lines of helium\nlike ions of Si, S, Ar and Ca are smaller.\nFigure 14 shows a representative EMOS spectrum of M\n87 fitted with the MEKAL and APEC model. As already\nshown, the single temperature MEKAL model can well\nfit the spectra including the strength of Fe-L, Fe-K and\nS lines. The APEC model gives a better fit for the FeL/Mg-K structure around 1.2\u20131.5 keV and the Fe-L/Si-K\nstructure around 1.8 keV. However, the single temperature\nAPEC model cannot fit the Fe-K and Fe-K, as well as the\nratio of K\u03b1 lines of S simultaneously, although the fit to\nthe Fe-L complex and the continuum is good.\nUsing the APEC code, we fitted the deprojected spectra of the EMOS in the same way as described in \u00a73.3,\nand \u00a75.1-2. Figure 15 and Tables 5 summarize the temperatures derived with the APEC code. Due to the inconsistency of the S line ratios and the strength of the Fe-K\nline, the reduced \u03c72 is systematically worse at R > 2\u2032 compared to those obtained from the MEKAL model fit. The\ntemperatures obtained from the whole energy band, the\nFe-L complex and the hard energy band using the APEC\ncode are consistent with those obtained using the MEKAL\nmodel. The derived Fe abundances, which are mainly determined by Fe-L lines, are also consistent with those from\nMEKAL model (figure 17). In contrast, the temperatures\nfrom Si and S energy band are 10% larger, due to the\n\nFig. 14. The deprojected spectrum of EMOS within\nR=4-8\u2032 (crosses) fitted with a MEKAL model (thin black\nlines), an APEC model (bold black lines) and a two temperature APEC model (bold gray lines). The bottom panels shows the contributions to \u03c72 .\n\nchanges of the strength of the K\u03b1 lines of hydrogen like\nions.\nThe projected radial profile of the S line ratios are also\ncompared with the calculated profile from the deprojected\ndata (Figure 16 ). Although the deprojected temperatures\ncannot reproduce the observed line ratios, the difference\nis only 10% in temperature. Therefore, as in the case with\nMEKAL model, temperatures derived from whole energy\nband, the Fe-L, the hard band Si, and S energy band agree\nwithin 10%.\nHowever, there is a discrepancy between the Fe-L and\nFe-K strength. Figure 17 also shows the Fe abundances\nobtained from the deprojected spectra above 2 keV, fitted\nwith a single temperature MEKAL and APEC model. We\ndenote the derived Fe abundances from > 2 keV, as FeKMEKAL and Fe-KAPEC , and those from the whole energy\nband as F e \u2212 LMEKAL and Fe-LAPEC for the MEKAL and\nAPEC codes, respectively. Outside R > 1\u2032 , Fe-KMEKAL ,\nFe-LMEKAL , and Fe-LAPEC agree well each other. Within\nR < 1\u2032 , Fe-KMEKAL are consistent with Fe abundances\nobtained from the two temperature MEKAL model. However, Fe-KMEKAL are systematically larger by \u223c60%.

Intrinsic absorption\nThe hydrogen column density, NH , derived from the single\nMEKAL fit is almost constant at R > 2\u2032 (Table 2; Figure 19). As summarized in table 2 and 5, the NH derived\nfrom the single APEC model is consistent with those from\nthe single MEKAL model. The average value at R > 2\u2032\nis 1.5 (1.2-1.7)\u00d71020cm\u22122 and 1.3 (1.0-1.5) \u00d71020cm\u22122\nfor the EPN and EMOS, respectively. Within 2 arcmin,\nthe two phase MEKAL model fit gives a consistent value\nwith those at R > 2\u2032 , although the single MEKAL model\nfit gives a higher NH value by several \u00d71020 cm\u22122 . The\nresponse matrices of the EPN of September 2000 and\nNovember 2000 give systematically different values by 1\n\u223c 2 \u00d71020 cm\u22122 . Therefore, there may be a systematic\nuncertainty of a few \u00d71020 cm\u22122 .\nThe value determined by the ROSAT PSPC observation is about 1.5(1.4-2.0)\u00d71020cm\u22122 (Nulsen and\nB\u00f6hringer 1995; B\u00f6hringer 1999).

The observed NH is consistent with the value obtained by ROSAT and also the\nGalactic column density. In addition, the power-law component from the central AGN shows no significant excess\nabsorption.

Density profile\nWe have assumed NH to be the average value of those obtained at R > 2\u2032 , since the higher NH at R < 2\u2032 from the\nsingle MEKAL model may be artificial. We have fixed the\nC, N, O abundance to 0.51(1 + (R/0.76\u2032 )2 )\u22120.09 , which is\nthe best fit \u03b2-model of the abundance profile of these elements. Since the cooler component is distributed around\nthe radio structures, and the hotter component is almost\nspherically symmetric, the latter should dominate. Thus,\nwithin 0.35 to 1.4\u2032 , we fitted the EPN spectra with a two\ncomponent MEKAL model and adopted the electron density of the hotter component. The electron density (ne ),\nprofile derived is shown in Table 6 and Figure 20. This results are mostly consistent with those obtained by Nulsen\nand B\u00f6hringer (1995), when considering the difference in\nthe assumption of the abundance.\nWe fitted the n2e profile with a sum of two \u03b2 models, a\ncompact and an extended one, both centered on M 87. We\nfixed the \u03b2 of the extended component to be 0.47. which is\nthe value obtained by ROSAT All Sky Survey (B\u00f6hringer\net al. 1994). The obtained best-fit parameters are shown in\nTable 7. The two \u03b2 components have distinct parameters,\nand cross over at R \u223c 2\u2032 , or \u223c 10 kpc.\n8. Dark matter profile\nThe total mass M (R) within a 3-dimensional radius R,\nassuming hydrostatic equilibrium and spherical symmetry,\nis given by (e.g Sarazin 1988),\n\u0013\n\u0012\nd ln T\nd ln n\nkT R\n+\nM (R) = \u2212\nG\u03bcmp d ln R d ln R\nwhere mp is the proton mass, k is the Boltzmann constant,\nG is the constant of gravity, and \u03bc \u223c 0.63 is the mean\nparticle mass in units of mp .\n\nBased on the deprojected temperature and density\nprofile obtained in \u00a73.2 and \u00a75, we have calculated the\ngravitational mass of the M 87 system, together with the\ngas mass profile using the power-law relation in Figure\n3, and the double-\u03b2 relation approximated as in Table 7.\nThe upper and lower limit of the mass profile is calculated\nconsidering the uncertainty of the density gradient and\nthe temperature. The temperature gradient is assumed to\nbe smooth and expressed as the power-law relation. The\nupper and lower limit of the density gradient of the i-th\nshell is obtained from the ratio of the value within i + 1-th\nshell to that within i \u2212 1-th shell. As plotted in Figure 21,\nour result is mostly consistent with the dynamical mass\nprofiles obtained by stars (Kronawitter et al. 2000) and\nglobular clusters (Cohen & Ryzhov 1997).\nThe calculated mass-to-blue light ratio (hereafter\nM/LB ) of the stellar population ranges between 6 and 10\n(e.g. Kronawitter et al. 2000). Assuming a constant stellar\nM/LB of 8, in Figure 21, we also plotted the stellar mass\nprofile, calculated from the luminosity profile in Giraud\n(1999). Within nearly 0.5re , the stellar velocity dispersion\nprofile indicates that the dynamical M/LB is \u223c11 (e.g.\nKronawitter et al. 2000). Here, re is the effective radius of\nM 87, which is 7.8 kpc. Our mass profile indicates that at\nR=1-2re , the M/LB is about 17 and beyond this radius,\nthe slope of the mass profile increases and M/LB reaches\n\u223c 200 at 10re .\n\n9.

The cooling time is lower than the Hubble time\nwithin R \u223c 50 kpc (Figure 22). As shown in Fig. 22, the\n\u1e40I obtained is roughly proportional to the radius. At R \u223c\n50 kpc, \u1e40I is 10 M\u2299 , which is consistent to the classical\nvalue obtained by Stewart et al. (1984) from the Einstein\nobservation.\n9.2. Spectral fitting using a spectral cooling flow model\nWith the RGS we can observe only the very central core of\ncooling flow clusters. In contrast, using the EPN, we can\naccumulate spectra within the entire cooling flow region.\nAt R = 4\u2032 , the derived cooling time is only a few Gyr\nand \u1e40I is 8 M\u2299 y\u22121 , respectively. The net effect of resonance scattering is negligible for the radiative output in\nthis integrated circular region. Without any heating, the\ngas should cool down to 0 keV, emitting X-rays at intermediate temperatures. Therefore, the spectral cooling\nrate, \u1e40S , within the radius should be 8M\u2299 y\u22121 .\n\n\fKyoko Matsushita et al.: XMM-Newton observation of M87\n\n17\n\nWe fitted the deprojected spectra within R < 4\u2032 with\na cooling flow model using the MEKAL code modified by\nphotoelectric absorption. As in other cooling flow clusters\nobserved by RGS, in order to fit the spectra, we still need\na cut-off temperature, lowT, which is found to be 1.4 keV\n(Table 8). Figure 23 shows the EPN spectrum within R <\n4\u2032 , fitted with the cooling flow model. We also plotted\nin the figure, another cooling flow model with lowT=0.1\nkeV, fitted only to the data in the spectral range above\n1.2 keV. The difference in the continuum level between\n0.2 and 0.5 keV is due to the instrumental low-energy tail\nof Fe-L and O-K lines. The component cooling radiatively\nto 0 keV should emit strong Fe-L lines between 0.6 to 1.0\nkeV, which are not seen in the spectrum.\nWhen adding an isothermal MEKAL component, we\ncan fit the spectra with a cooling flow component with\nlowT=0.1 keV. However, \u1e40S is only 0.8 M\u2299 y\u22121 , which is\na factor of 10 smaller than \u1e40I at the same radius.\n9.2.1. Test of a bimodal abundance model\nFabian et al. (2001) made a proposal to solve the cooling flow problem by a scenario in which metals in the\nICM are not uniformly distributed. In this suggestion, a\nmetal poor part of the gas cools without emitting lines\nand a metal rich part cools rapidly. In this way, the total\nstrength of Fe-L line emission should be reduced. A bimodal abundance model, with 0.01 solar abundances and\n10 times higher abundances than the single abundance\nmodel and mass deposition rates of 7.3 and 0.7 M\u2299 /yr,\nrespectively, is shown in Figure 23. It is very different from\nthe observed spectrum in the Fe-L structure and strength\nof K-\u03b1 lines (Figure 23), since it reduces not only Fe-L\nlines but also K lines of Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe (see also\nB\u00f6hringer et al. 2002). In order to obtain the observed\nstrength of K lines with these mass deposition rates, the\nabundances in the high metallicity component should be\n\u223c 100 solar. Therefore, we have tried another bimodal\nmetal abundance model, where the mass deposition rates\nof the two components are allowed to be free parameters,\nand fitted the spectra above 1 keV. Figure 23 also shows\nthe best fit model, extrapolated to lower energies. With\nthe mass deposition rates of 4 and 4 M\u2299 /yr, for the metal\nrich and metal poor components respectively, the spectra\nabove \u223c 1 keV can be fitted. Because of the dependence\nof the cooling function on metallicity, the Fe-L strength\nbelow 0.9 keV is slightly reduced compared to that of the\nsingle abundance model. However, the model shows very\nstrong Fe-L lines below 0.9 keV. We then added absorption for the metal rich components and then allowed the\nabundances of the metal rich component to vary. Although\nincluding a column density of 5\u00d71021cm\u22122 dramatically\nimproved the fit, the fit is much worse compared to the fit\nwith the cut-off temperature. In addition, such high absorption heavily reduces the spectra around the 0.67 keV\nO line. Increasing the O abundance of the metal rich com-\n\nFig. 23. Deprojected spectra within R < 4\u2032 fitted with a\ncooling flow model with a cut-off temperature, lowT=1.44\nkeV (solid line, a). The bold dotted line (b) shows the\nmodel with cooling to 0.1 keV. The thin dashed lines of\nthe upper panel, (c1) and (c2), corresponds to the model\nwith a model with 10 times higher metallicity and a model\nwith low metal abundance, respectively. The spectral cooling flow rates are summarized in the panel. The sum of\n(c1) and (c2) is also plotted. The dotted lines of the lower\npanel, (d1) and (d2) are components of another bimodal\nmetal abundance mdoel, and the solid lines of (e1) and\n(e2) corresponds to the model with excess absorption applied for the metal rich components.\nponents does not solve the problem, since it reduces the\nstrength of Fe-L lines due to the difference in the cooling\nfunction. Therefore, there must exist an unabsorbed component whose O abundance is not so peculiar. For intrinsic\nabsorption, more details are discussed also on B\u00f6hringer\net al. (2002).\nIn summary, any multi-abundance model cannot explain the observed Fe-L profiles. In order to explain it, we\nneed a sharp cut off in the temperature distribution.\n\n\f18\nR\narcmin\n0.0-4.0\n0.0-4.0\n0.0-4.0\n0.0-0.25\n0.25-0.5\n0.5-1.0\n1.0-2.0\n2.0-4.0\n4.0-8.0\n8.0-11.3\n11.3-13.5\n\nKyoko Matsushita et al.: XMM-Newton observation of M87\nmodel\nmkcflow\nmekal+mkcflow\nmekal+mkcflow\nmekal+mkcflow\nmekal+mkcflow\nmekal+mkcflow\nmekal+mkcflow\nmekal+mkcflow\nmekal+mkcflow\nmekal+mkcflow\nmekal+mkcflow\n\nkTvmekal\n(keV)\n-\n1.75+0.01\n\u22120.01\n1.58\n1.7+0.8\n\u22120.6\n1.58+0.08\n\u22120.08\n1.52+0.05\n\u22120.06\n1.65+0.06\n\u22120.06\n1.97+0.05\n\u22120.05\n+0.07\n2.30\u22120.08\n2.60+0.12\n\u22120.13\n2.66+0.16\n\u22120.16\n\nlowkTcf\n(keV)\n1.442+0.002\n\u22120.002\n0.10 (fix)\n0.10 (fix)\n0.10 (fix)\n0.10 (fix)\n0.10 (fix)\n0.10 (fix)\n0.10 (fix)\n0.10 (fix)\n0.10 (fix)\n0.10 (fix)\n\nhighkTcf\n(keV)\n2.30+0.02\n\u22120.02\n=kTvmekal\n=kTvmekal\n=kTvmekal\n=kTvmekal\n=kTvmekal\n=kTvmekal\n=kTvmekal\n=kTvmekal\n=kTvmekal\n=kTvmekal\n\nNHMEKAL\n(1020 cm\u22122 )\n1.3+0.2\n\u22120.2\n2.9+0.2\n\u22120.2\n1.5\n1.5 (fix)\n2.5+0.6\n\u22120.5\n4.4+1.0\n\u22121.0\n2.8+1.3\n\u22121.3\n1.5+0.5\n\u22120.5\n+0.4\n1.6\u22120.4\n1.8+0.8\n\u22120.9\n1.5+0.6\n\u22120.6\n\nNHMEKAL\n(1020 cm\u22122 )\n=NHMEKAL\n=NHMEKAL\n117\n1.5 (fix)\n=NHMEKAL\n=NHMEKAL\n=NHMEKAL\n=NHMEKAL\n=NHMEKAL\n=NHMEKAL\n=NHMEKAL\n\n\u1e40\n(M\u2299 )\n13.8+0.01\n\u22120.01\n0.63+0.20\n\u22120.08\n8.0 (fix)\n0.18+0.03\n\u22120.04\n0.08+0.03\n\u22120.02\n0.10+0.04\n\u22120.03\n0.05+0.05\n\u22120.04\n< 0.13\n< 0.29\n< 0.23\n< 0.20\n\n\u03c72 /\u03bc\n370/191\n416/130\n1088/192\n30/51\n62/51\n91/51\n78/51\n103/51\n58/51\n51/51\n111/51\n\nTable 8. Result of spectral fitting using a spectral cooling flow model\n\n9.2.2. Radial profile of spectral cooling flow component\nThe observed radial profile of \u1e40I is not constant, but\nroughly proportional to R. The differential of \u1e40I between\na shell and next shell implies that we should observe a\ncooling flow component in the spectrum of each radial\nshell. We thus fitted deprojected spectra with a cooling flow model with lowT=0.1 keV, and an isothermal\nMEKAL model. The result is summarized in Table 8 and\nFigure 22. Within R < 1\u2032 , the fit has improved from the\nsingle temperature fit. However, the \u1e40S values, are a factor of 10 to 20 lower than the differential of \u1e40I . Only for\nthe innermost shell, \u1e40S and \u1e40I are consistent with each\nother.\n10. Discussion\n10.1. Temperature structure\nThe deprojected spectra of M 87 strongly indicate that excluding the region associated to the radio structures, the\nICM is single phase; at a given radius, the ICM is dominated by one temperature component. We cannot detect\nany multi-phase cooling flow component as seen by Allen\net al. (2001). The ICM is also not characterized by a twophase structure as suggested by ASCA observations of the\nCentaurus cluster (Fukazawa et al. 1994; Ikebe et al. 1999),\nand M 87 (Matsumoto et al. 1996).\nWhen excluding the regions with the radio structures, the ICM is nearly spherically symmetric. Using the\nMEKAL model, a single phase model can fit the deprojected spectra well at R > 2\u2032 . The temperature profile\nhas a positive temperature gradient, \u223c 1.7 keV at R = 1'\nand \u223c 2.5 keV at R=15\u2032. The consistency of the temperatures obtained by the continuum, Fe-L region, Si, and\nS line ratios, Fe-L to Fe-K ratio indicate that the ICM\nis dominated by a single temperature component. The regions associated to the radio structures have an additional\ntemperature components of 1 keV. At R < 2\u2032 , since it is\ndifficult to filter the complicated radio structures within\n2\u2032 with the XMM spatial resolution, we observe the major\n\nICM components with the temperature of 1.7 keV, and\nsmall amount of the 1 keV components. The spatial distribution of the latter component indicates that the cooler\ncomponent also relates to the region corresponding to the\nradio lobes (see also Belsole et al. 2001).\nThe R-S model gives a temperature lower by 20% than\nMEKAL model. In order to fit the spectra, the R-S model\nrequires an additional high temperature component. However, the two temperature R-S model cannot explain the\nobserved Si and S line ratios.\nExcept for the Fe-K line strength, the APEC temperatures are consistent with the MEKAL models within 1015%. Due to changes of the strength of K\u03b1 lines, the single\nphase APEC model cannot explain the strength of Fe-K\nlines, although it can fit the Fe-L and continuum simultaneously. The S line ratio is discrepancy by a factor of 1.5,\nbut it introduces only a 10% difference in the temperature\nstructure.\nResonant scattering of line emission should be important in dense core of galaxy clusters. (Gil'fanov et al. 1987,\nTawara et al. 1997). Shigeyama (1998) calculated the effect on M 87 system, and found that surface brightness\nprofile considerably decreased within 1-2' because many\nFe-L lines are optically thick. In M87, B\u00f6hringer et al.\n(2001) suggested that the resonant scattering may explain\nthe observed sharp abundance drop at center. This effect\nmay also change the spectra and the Fe-L line profile in the\ncentral region. Part of the 1 keV component may be due\nto this effect. Therefore, in order to study the temperature\nstructure within 1-2' arcmin exactly, we have to consider\neffect of the resonance scattering. However, since the temperature obtained from the continuum spectra is close to\nthat from the whole energy band, the main temperature\ncomponent should be similar to the obtained values. At\nleast using the MEKAL model, the strength of the Fe-L\nand Fe-K are consistent with each other, which have a\ndifferent dependence on the resonance line scattering. In\naddition, most of the 1 keV component should be related\nto the radio activity which has a complicated spatial distribution (Belsole et al. 2001). Most of the resonantly scat-\n\n\fKyoko Matsushita et al.: XMM-Newton observation of M87\n\n19\n\ntered light will be reemitted at slightly larger projected\nradii. Therefore integrating over the region, R < 4\u2032 will\nreduce the net effect of scattering and the spectra will\nhardly be disturbed.\nMatsushita (2001) found that normal elliptical galaxies have \u03b2spec =1. The central stellar velocity dispersion of\nM 87 is 350 km/s (Whitemore et al. 1985). The assumption of \u03b2spec =1 implies a temperature of 0.8 keV, which\nagrees well with the observed central ICM temperature of\nM 87. The ICM temperature at 10\u201315\u2032 of 2.5 keV also\nagrees with the velocity dispersion of early-type galaxies\nof the Virgo cluster, which is 570 km/s (Binggeli and Tammann 1987). The observed constancy in the temperature\nsuggests that the central cool temperature mainly reflects\nthe galaxy potential, even though some part of the cool\ncomponent may be produced by a small cooling flow in\nthe central region.\n10.2. Intrinsic absorption\nThe hydrogen column density is almost flat within the field\nof view. In addition, the spectrum of the central AGN does\nnot show any absorption feature. Therefore, intrinsic absorption should be negligible in the M 87 system. If there\nis excess NH of the order of 1020 cm\u22122 and the absorbing\nmatter is uniformly distributed within 10 kpc and 50 kpc,\nthe mass of the absorbing matters is 108 M\u2299 and 109 M\u2299 ,\nrespectively, which is much smaller than the cooling flow\nmass deposition rate accumulated over a Hubble time.\n10.3. Potential structure of ellipticals and clusters of\ngalaxies\nWe have determined the gravitational mass profile of the\nM 87 system, directly from the observed density and temperature profiles. At 0.5\u20132 re , M/LB of the system is constant at \u223c 17. Beyond this radius, it starts to increase to\n\u223c 200 at 80 kpc.\nThis structure is essentially the same feature as seen in\nthe Fornax cluster (Ikebe et al. 1996), the Centaurus cluster (Ikebe et al. 1999) and NGC 4636 (Matsushita et al.\n1998). Figure 24 summarizes the gravitational mass profiles of the 3 cD galaxies and NGC 4636. These galaxies\nhave similar hierarchical mass profiles; the gravitational\nmass gradually increases up to several re , where the gravitational to stellar mass ratio is common among galaxies.\nThen, M/L start to increase steeply.\nBefore the total to stellar mass ratio increases steeply,\nthe total M/LB is \u223c 17 at 1 re , and \u223c 30 even at 10\nre . This feature should reflect the potential of elliptical\ngalaxies. The M/LB of the central core of these galaxies\nobtained by the dynamics and the same ratio obtained by\nthe stellar population synthesis models are consistent with\neach other giving a typical value of 6\u201310 (e.g. Kronawitter\net al. 2000). Considering the observed metallicity gradient of stars, the stellar M/LB should be slightly smaller\n\nFig. 24. Integrated mass profiles of the total gravitating matter scaled by LB , and the stellar component (solid\nline) in the M 87 (solid line; LX /L\u03c3 =22), the Centaurus\ncluster (dotted line; Ikebe et al. 1999; LX /L\u03c3 =47), NGC\n1399 (dashed line; Ikebe et al. 1996 ;LX /L\u03c3 =3), and NGC\n4636 (gray line; Matsushita et al. 1998; LX /L\u03c3 =12). LX\nand L\u03c3 means the ISM luminosity within 4re and kinematical energy input from stellar mass loss (Matsushita\n2001).\nin the outer regions (e.g. Kodama & Arimoto 1997). Our\nresult suggests that the dark mass distribution of elliptical\ngalaxies is slightly more extended than those of stars. It\nis thought that elliptical galaxies have a 10 times larger\namount of dark mass than stellar mass (e.g. Ciotti et al.\n1991). However, the galaxies themselves may not contain\nsuch large amount of mass. This result should be important for the study of the origin of the dark matter content\nin elliptical galaxies and also for the study of the formation\nand evolution of these galaxies.\nThe scatter of the X-ray to blue luminosity ratio\nof early-type galaxies has long been a problem (e.g.\nCanizares et al. 1987). Matsushita (2001) found that LX\nof most of the early-type galaxies is well explained by a\nkinematical heating of the gas supplied by stellar mass\nloss (L\u03c3 ). All of the galaxies which have much larger LX\nthan L\u03c3 have very extended X-ray emission. Figure 24\nshows that the galaxies with a larger LX /L\u03c3 have smaller\nradii of the starting point of the strong increase of M/L,\nwhen scaled re . In other words, the X-ray luminosity of cD\ngalaxies may be determined in relation to their potential\nstructure, as indicated by Matsushita (2001).\n10.4. Problem of standard cooling flow model\nThe standard cooling flow model indicates that the ICM is\nmulti-temperature on small scales, since it is thought that\n\n\f20\n\nKyoko Matsushita et al.: XMM-Newton observation of M87\n\nmass is deposited within the whole cooling flow region.\nThe cooling matter should emit strong Fe-L lines below\n0.9 keV. We cannot detect a significant spectral cooling\nflow component from the whole field of view of the detector and the ICM at any given radius is dominated by a\nsingle temperature component. The upper limit on \u1e40S is\nan order of magnitude smaller than \u1e40I . A bimodal metal\nabundance distribution model cannot explain the observed\nFe-L profile.\nThe resonance scattering may reduce the strength of\nsome resonance lines. However, all the Fe-L lines below\n0.9 keV, which includes both resonance lines and nonresonance lines, are suppressed compared with the expected value for a cooling flow. In addition, the spectral\ncooling flow component is also small where the resonance\nscattering is not effective. Therefore, the resonant scattering can not be responsible for the suppresion of the Fe-L\nlines below 0.9 keV.\nAt 1 re (1.6\u2032 ) of M 87, \u1e40I is \u223c 4M\u2299 yr\u22121 . In contrast,\nthe upper limit on \u1e40S is \u223c 0.4M\u2299 yr\u22121 . This value is\nclose to the stellar mass loss rate within 1 re , which is 0.5\nM\u2299 yr\u22121 . At this radius, tcool is 109 yr and the gas mass is\n2 109 M\u2299 . Therefore, considering the observed abundance\ngradient, the standard cooling flow model indicate that\nthe gas should be diluted by metal poor surrounding gas.\nHowever, the observed Fe abundance of M 87 within 1re ,\n\u223c 1 solar, is similar to those of normal X-ray luminous\ngalaxies, which are also about \u223c 1 solar (Matsushita et\nal. 1997; 2000). Note that the observed ISM abundance of\nNGC 4636 from the RGS spectra is 0.9 solar (Xu et al.\n2001). In these systems, the enrichment has to be compared with a mass flow rate of \u223c 1M\u2299 yr\u22121 as implied by\nthe standard cooling flow models for these galaxies. For\nthe case of NGC 4636, the mass flow rate is determined\nto be \u223c 1M\u2299 yr\u22121 (Bregman, Miller, & Irwin 2001). The\neffect of the dilution by ICM should be determined by\na ratio of the mass flow rate and the optical luminosity\nsince metals ejected from a galaxy should be proportional\nto the stellar luminosity. Within 1re , the former rate of\nNGC 4636 is a factor of 10 smaller than that of M 87,\nwhile the latter is only a factor of 2.5 smaller. In a much\nlarger cooling flow as exists in M 87 in which the Fe enrichment is supplied by a stellar population comparable\nto that of normal ellipticals, the relative enrichment will\nbe less and the abundance gradient must be reduced in\ncontrast to the observed data. Therefore, the overall cooling flow expected from the classical galaxy cluster cooling\nflow model, should not exist in M 87, although a small\nscale cooling flow, with mass deposition rate close to the\nstellar mass loss rate, may exists in the central core of the\nclassical cooling flow regions.\n11. Conclusion\nThe major result of this paper is strong evidence that the\nICM in the halo of M 87 is isothermal locally, except prob-\n\nably for the very central region, where more than one temperature component is present. This could be partly due\nto the interaction effects of the ICM with the jet and the\nradio lobes of M 87. This finding and the fact that no spectral signature of low temperature components below temperatures of 0.8 keV are observed is in disagreement with\nthe standard cooling flow model which predicts a strongly\nmulti-phase structure of the ICM and a distinct temperature distribution and resulting spectrum with clear signature of low temperature components. We have also shown\nthat strong inhomogeneities in the metal distribution cannot resolve this problem. Therefore we conclude that the\nscenario for the dense gas with short cooling time in the\ncenters of clusters needs to be revised. Probably heating\nprocesses that can substantially reduced the mass deposition have to be reconsidered, like the energy input of the\ncentral AGN. The central temperature closely reflects the\ngravitational potential depth of the central galaxy, rather\nthan the existence of a cooling flow.\nAcknowledgements.
