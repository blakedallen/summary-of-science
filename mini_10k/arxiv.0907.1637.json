Graphene is in fact characterized by a\nhigh carrier-mobility,1,2,3 which make those systems very\nexciting in view of future applications in nanoelectronics. In standard experimental setups, few-layers graphene\n(FLG) interacts with the environment through doping\ncharges coming from the top (ntop ) and from the bottom (nbot ) of the system. These charges determine the\nexternal electric field [E = (ntop \u2212 nbot )|e|/(2\u01eb0 )] and the\ntotal electron concentration (n = ntop + nbot ). E and n\ncan thus be varied independently changing the charges\nfrom the two sides. ntop and nbot can be intentionally induced by applying gate voltage differences between\nthe system and the substrate, or via atoms/molecules\ndeposition on top of the system. On the other hand,\nimportant unintentional doping charges are typically\npresent. For instance, in FLG obtained by exfoliation\non SiO2 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 or epitaxially grown on SiC,20 a charge transfer occurs between\nthe substrate and the system, giving rise to a finite nbot .\nIn analogy, an additional ntop can be accidentally induced\nby the uncontrolled adsorption of molecules from the atmosphere.\nAmong FLG, the bilayer graphene is particularly interesting because it becomes a tunable band-gap semiconductor under the application of an electric field perpendicular to the system.4,5,6,20,21,22,23,24 In this context,\nthe determination of the electric field is crucial in order\nto control the band-gap. Moreover, in graphene charge\nimpurities originating from the top or from the substrate\nare the main source of scattering which reduces conduction performances.25 Therefore, the determination of the\ncharge transfer from the substrate or from the atmosphere is highly desirable for possible applications. Although experimental techniques allow to estimate the total electron concentration on the system, an accurate determination of the respective values of top and bottom\ncharges has never been achieved so far, and can be particularly challenging, for instance, when doping is intention-\n\nally induced by deposition of molecules or polymeric electrolyte. In this work we use a tight binding (TB) model\nfitted on ab initio calculations to compute the Raman\nshift, broadening, and relative Raman intensity of the G\nmodes in bilayer graphene, as a function of the electron\nconcentration, for different values of top charges. In particular, the screening properties of the system in presence\nof an external electric field are described using ab initio\ndensity functional theory calculations (DFT), including\nthe GW correction, while a TB model is used to reproduce the DFT calculated, GW corrected, band structure\nin the full Brillouin zone. We show that from the measured Raman spectra of bilayer graphene it is possible\nto determine the external charge distribution and thus\nthe external electric field and the actual carriers concentration. This result is especially relevant since it shows\nthat Raman spectroscopy, which is already widely used\nto investigate graphene-based systems, can be used to\ncharacterize the electrostatic environment of the sample.\nMoreover, since the charges coming from the atmosphere\nand the substrate are not expected to depend on the number of layers, Raman measurements on bilayer graphene\ncan also be used to determine the origin and the amount\nof the unintentional doping of monolayer and few-layers\ngraphene in the same environment.\nThe Raman spectra of monolayer graphene are characterized by a doubly-degenerate G peak (E2g mode)\nat around 1580 cm\u22121 .7,8,9,10,11,12,13 This mode shows a\nstrong electron-phonon coupling, which induces a phonon\nrenormalization when n is varied. Therefore, Raman can\nbe used to measure the total electron concentration. In\nbilayer graphene, in the absence of an external electric\nfield the G peak splits, as in graphite, in a doublydegenerate Raman active mode (E2g ) and a doublydegenerate, Raman inactive, infra-red active mode (Eu ).\nThe E2g mode is characterized by a symmetric in-phase\ndisplacement of the atoms in the two layers (Fig.1-a),\nwhereas Eu is characterized by an antisymmetric out-ofphase displacement of those atoms (Fig.1-b). Most Raman measurements on bilayer graphene show a single G\npeak whose position is used, as in monolayer graphene,\nto measure the electron concentration on the system.11,14\n\n\f2\nthe absolute frequencies we use the following 4\u00d74 matrix:\n\u0010\n\u03b3an \u0011\n\u03a9\u03bc\u03bd (ntop , n) = \u03c90 + \u2206\u03c9(n) \u2212 \u03a00 + i\n\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n+ \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd (ntop , n),\n(2)\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Schematic representation of the Raman active mode E2g (a) and the Raman inactive mode Eu\n(b) in bilayer graphene. A,B are the inequivalent carbon\natoms in the top layer, A' and B' are the inequivalent carbon\natoms in the bottom layer. In a Bernal stacking configuration,\nA and A' are the superposed atoms.\n\nInterestingly, the splitting of the G peak has been observed in the Raman spectra of bilayer graphene,15 and it\nhas been recently attributed to symmetry breaking due to\nthe application of an external electric field.32 Moreover,\nother experimental works recently reported on the infrared spectra of gated bilayer graphene.5,16,17,18,19 These\nfindings suggest that a deep understanding of the behavior of a splitted G mode in gated bilayer graphene could\nlead to quantify not only the total electron concentration\nn but also the separate values of ntop and nbot .\n\nII.\n\nCOMPUTATIONAL DETAILS\n\nIn order to calculate the electron-phonon coupling\n(EPC) component of the phonon frequencies, broadenings, and relative Raman intensities as functions of n\nand ntop , we consider the \u0393 phonon self-energy,26,27 projected onto the subspace of the two E2g and the two Eu\nmodes:\n\u03a0\u03bc\u03bd (ntop , n) =\n\n\u03bc \u03bd\nX Dji\nDij (fki \u2212 fkj )\nh\u0304\n,\nM \u03c90 Nk\n\u01ebki \u2212 \u01ebkj + h\u0304\u03c90 + i\u03b7\n\n(1)\n\nk,i,j\n\nwhere the sum is on the electron wave vector k and\nthe electronic \u03c0 bands i, j. \u03bc, \u03bd=1,4 are the phonon indexes, Nk is the number of k vectors, and fki is the\noccupation of the electron state |kii with energy \u01ebki .\n\u03bc\nDij\n= hki|\u2206H \u03bc |kji is the EPC and \u2206H \u03bc is the Hamiltonian derivative with respect to the atomic displacement\ncorresponding to the \u03bc phonon. \u03b7 equals 0.009 eV and\nM is the atomic mass.\nFrom the phonon self-energy one can calculate only\nfrequency variations due to changes in the electron concentration and in the band structure. In order to obtain\n\nwhere \u03c90 =1581.5 cm\u22121 is the experimentally measured frequency of the Raman active G peak in bilayer\ngraphene, in absence of doping and electric field.14 \u03b3an\nis the contribution to the broadening of the G modes\nin graphene and graphite from the anharmonic phononphonon interaction, whose value is estimated to be 1.8\ncm\u22121 .28 \u03a00 is the phonon self-energy of the doubly degenerate E2g mode calculated\nfor n = 0 \u0003and ntop = 0, and\n\u0002\nit is given by \u03a00 = Re uk\u03bc \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd (0, 0)uk\u03bd , where k = 1, 2\ncorresponds to the two E2g modes and uk\u03bc are the corresponding eigenvectors. In presence of doping charge the\nlattice parameter changes and the corresponding variation of the G modes frequencies can be obtained for\nzero electric field by ab initio calculations:29 \u2206\u03c9(n) =\n\u22125.75 103 \u2206a(n) cm\u22121 , where \u2206a(n) is the relative variation of the lattice parameter, as in Eq.(2) of Ref.29 In\nthis work we do not include in the phonon calculations\nthe effects due to direct interaction of the system with adsorbates and with the substrate donating doping charge.\nHowever, as shown for intercalated graphite,36,37 we assume that this is not relevant also for the in-plane vibrational modes of bilayer graphene.\nThe eigenvalues of \u03a9\u03bc\u03bd are of the form (\u03c9i + i\u03b3i /2),\nwhere \u03c9i is the frequency of phonon i and \u03b3i is the full\nwidth half maximum (FWHM), given by the EPC and\nthe anharmonic phonon-phonon interaction. In the general case of finite n and ntop the four eigenmodes of \u03a9\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\u03b5i\u03bc , are still two by two degenerate, but they are a superposition of the E2g and Eu eigenmodes of the unbiased\ni\nbilayer graphene. Their relative Raman intensities IR\nare\ncalculated as:\nP\ni\nk 2\nk=1,2 |\u03b5\u03bc * u\u03bc |\ni\nP\nP\nIR =\n,\n(3)\ni\nk 2\ni\nk=1,2 |\u03b5\u03bc * u\u03bc |\nP i\n=1.\nwhere i IR\nWe have shown that the screening properties of bilayer graphene under the application of an external\nelectric field are characterized by inter- and intra-layer\npolarizations.24 Most of the calculations of the band gap\nas a function of n and ntop are based on TB models,6,38\nwhich usually consider only the inter-layer palarization,\nresulting in an overestimation of the band gap. In the\npresent work the band structure of the \u03c0 electrons [\u01ebki\nand |kii in Eq.(1)] is obtained using the scheme presented\nin Ref.24 The band gap is computed by ab initio DFT calculations, including the GW corrections, and both interand intra-layer polarizations are fully taken into account.\nThe full band structure of gated bilayer graphene is then\ncomputed using a TB model, which is able to reproduce\nall the important features of the DFT calculated, GW\ncorrected bands, including the electron-hole asymmetry.\nIn order to compute \u2206H \u03bc one needs to calculate the\nderivative of the tight binding Hamiltonian with respect\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Raman shift in bilayer graphene for\nntop = nbot and for ntop = \u2212nbot . Calculated values of the\nshifts are connected by lines. For a given value of n (panel a)\nor ntop (panel b) there are two phonon modes represented with\ntwo rectangles. The height of the rectangles is the FWHM\nand the areas are proportional to the relative Raman intensities (i.e. the integrated area of each peak) of the two modes.\nThus, the ratio of the widths of the two rectangles is equal to\nthe ratio of the maximum heights of the two Raman peaks.\nWhen the ratio is less than 0.1, the mode with the smallest intensity is colored in gray (red), otherwise is black. Circles are\nexperimental results from Ref.17 and the errorbars represent\nthe experimental FWHM.\n\nto the atomic positions. However, only the variation of\nthe first nearest-neighbors in-plane hopping parameters\n\u03b31 turns out to be relevant, and this only term is thus included in \u2206H \u03bc . The value we use for this quantity is 5.8\neV \u00c5\u22121 , which derives from the ab initio GW-calculated\nEPC at \u0393 for the E2g mode in monolayer graphene.30\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn Fig.2-a we show the calculated Raman shift as a\nfunction of n, for the case ntop =nbot , where the external\nelectric field and the band-gap are kept fixed to zero,\nas theoretically studied in Ref.31 In this case the E2g\nand Eu modes do not mix by symmetry. Analogously\nto monolayer graphene, the Raman active modes show a\nsingularity when the Fermi energy is half of the phonon\nenergy. In Fig.2-b we show the calculated Raman shifts\nfor the case ntop = \u2212nbot , as a function of ntop . This is a\nspecial situation where the external electric field is varied\nwhile n is kept fixed to zero, as realized in recent infra-red\nexperiments.5,17 In this case, the mixing between E2g and\nEu modes is weak due to the antisymmetric allocation of\ncharges in the two layers. The Raman active modes show\na singularity in the frequency and a divergence in the\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Raman shift in bilayer graphene as a\nfunction of the electron concentration n, for different values\nof ntop . See the caption of Fig.2.\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 4: Ratio between the relative Raman intensities of the\nhighest and lowest mode, a, and Raman shift, b, as a function of n. Filled dots are experimental results from Ref.15,33 ,\nshifted by n0 =-1.8 1013 cm\u22122 . Lines are the theoretical values\nfor ntop =-0.15, -0.25, -0.35 1013 cm\u22122 .\n\nFWHM when the band-gap is of the order of the phonon\nenergy.\nIn the most general situation the electric field and n\nare both finite. In Fig.3 we show the Raman shift of\nbilayer graphene as functions of n, for different values\nof ntop . In these cases, the E2g and Eu modes do mix,\nand at certain values of ntop and n two modes become\nRaman visible. Our results show an asymmetry between\npositive and negative values of ntop . For instance, in the\ncase ntop = 2.4 1013 cm\u22122 the FWHM of the lowest mode\nat n \u2248 -4 1013 cm\u22122 is higher than the same quantity\nfor the case ntop = -2.4 1013 cm\u22122 at n \u2248 4 1013 cm\u22122 .\nThis is due to the electron-hole asymmetry in the band\nstructure, which is properly described in our calculations.\nMoreover, the asymmetry between positive and negative\nn is enhanced by the effect of the lattice spacing variation\ninduced by the doping charge. Our results are qualitatively in agreement with recent calculations,32 based on\nTB model. They are however quantitatively different,\nbecause in our calculations we include the electron-hole\nasymmetry, the lattice spacing variation due to doping\ncharge, and both inter- and intra-layer polarizations. The\ndependence on n of the frequencies, FWHM, and relative\nRaman intensities is strongly influenced by ntop , and on\nthe basis of this observation we claim that the amount\nof uncontrolled ntop and nbot can be estimated from the\nRaman spectra of bilayer graphene when two modes are\nobserved.\nWe now compare our calculations to the experimental\nRaman spectra of bilayer graphene where the splitting of\nthe G mode is reported.15 In this work charges are intentionally induced on the system by applying a gate voltage\nbetween the bilayer and the SiO2 substrate. However,\n\nunintentional ntop and nbot arising from the atmosphere\nand the substrate can be present at zero gate voltage.\nBy comparing the experimental and calculated Raman\nshifts as a function of n for different ntop , we estimate a\ntotal electron concentration at zero gate voltage n0 = -1.8\n1013 cm\u22122 . In Fig.4-a and -b we show the ratio between\nthe relative Raman intensities of the highest and lowest\nmode, and the Raman shifts, respectively, as a function\nof the electron concentration n, for different values of\nntop . The former one strongly depends on ntop , while\nthe frequency shifts have a weaker dependence. The best\nagreement between theory and experiments indicates an\nunintentional charge coming from the atmosphere n0top =0.25 1013 cm\u22122 . From our estimate of n0 , we deduce an\nunintentional charge from the substrate n0bot =n0 -n0top =\n-1.55 1013 cm\u22122 . The agreement between experimental\ndata and theoretical results is good. However, we notice\nthat the slope of the theoretical curves is underestimated\nwith respect to the experimental ones. This could be\npossibly due to local desorption of molecules and doping variation induced by the laser light, or to hysteresis\neffects in the doping dependence on gate voltage.\nFinally, in the right side of Fig.2-b, we compare\nour theoretical results to the experimental frequencies\nand broadenings from recent infra-red measurements in\nRef.17 , where the doping charge is kept fixed to zero and\nthe electric field is varied. The agreement is excellent\nwith our lower frequency mode. In our calculations, the\nlower mode has a weak projection on Eu . However, this\nmode is strongly coupled with the electrons, as testified\nby the large FWHM. Such coupling enhances the effective charges associated with Eu and increases the infrared activity.18,34,35 Indeed, in Fig.3 of Ref.17 the measured infra-red intensity is maximum when the band-gap\nequals the phonon energy (about 0.2 eV), i.e. when the\nFWHM and thus the coupling of the mode with the electrons are maximum, while it decreases when the FWHM\ndecreases.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn summary, we have computed the Raman spectra of\ngated bilayer graphene, which is strongly influenced by\nthe interaction with the environment. We claim that by\nthe analysis of the splitting of the G mode in Raman\nmeasurements it is possible to estimate the amount of\nunintentional charges coming from the atmosphere and\nfrom the substrate. Here we compare our calculations\nwith the only experimental data available on the G mode\nsplitting in bilayer graphene, and we give an estimate of\nthe unintentional charges coming from the environment\nin this experiment. In order to facilitate the comparison\nof new experimental results with our theoretical calculations, we provide as additional material a set of computed\nRaman shifts, FWHM, and relative Raman intensities as\na function of n, for different values of ntop .39\n\n\f5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\nK.

Here we re-fit data from\nRef.15 for all gate voltages with two Lorentzians of fixed\nFWHM equal to 7 cm\u22121 , which is the value obtained in\nRef.15 for large negative voltages, where the two peaks\nare well resolved. Our choice is justified by the fact that,\naccording to our calculations, the EPC contribution to the\nFWHM is vanishing around n0 = -1.8 1013 cm\u22122 , for all\nconsidered ntop (Fig.3). Thus, the increase in broadening\nobserved in Ref.15 for positive value of gate voltage is not\ndue to an increase of the decay rate (\u03b3i ) but to the presence\nof two contributions of fixed width in the Raman peak,\nclose in frequency but not exactly superimposed. The root\nmean square error obtained with the two fitting procedures\nare comparable.\nM. J. Rice, N. O. Lipari, and S. Strassler, Phys. Rev. Lett.\n39, 1359 (1977).\nM. J. Rice and H.-Y. Choi, Phys.
