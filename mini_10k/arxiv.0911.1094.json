Marsiglio\n\narXiv:0911.1094v1 [cond-mat.supr-con] 5 Nov 2009\n\nDepartment of Physics, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, T6G 2G7\n(Dated: November 29, 2018)\nWe provide a brief summary of the observed sum rule anomalies in the high-Tc cuprate materials.\nA recent issue has been the impact of a non-infinite frequency cutoff in the experiment. In the\nnormal state, the observed anomalously high temperature dependence can be explained as a 'cutoff\neffect'. The anomalous rise in the optical spectral weight below the superconducting transition,\nhowever, remains as a solid experimental observation, even with the use of a cutoff frequency.\nPACS numbers:\n\nI.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThere is a global optical sum rule, due to Kubo,1 that\nstates that the sum total of the optical spectral weight\nis a constant of the material, and proportional to the\nelectron density in that material. An excellent demonstration of this sum rule was provided for Aluminum,2\nwhere an energy range on the order of hundreds of keV's\nwas required before all 13 electrons could be accounted\nfor.\nIn contrast, in the single band optical sum rule,1 the\ntotal optical spectral weight of a single band is a weighted\naverage of the second partial derivative of the single particle energy over the occupied states of that band in the\nfirst Brillouin. This sum rule is only useful experimentally if a reasonable energy separation exists between intraband transitions involving the band in question, and\nall other transitions involving the other bands in the material.\nThe usual philosophy in condensed matter physics is to\nfocus on low energy scales. For a metal this means that\nwe are interested in states near the Fermi energy. When\nsome phenomenon (say, a transition) occurs at low temperature, then the temperature often sets the scale for\nwhat is meant by 'low'. So it is that the Ferrell-GloverTinkham sum rule,3 , which is a special case of the global\nKubo sum rule applied to the superconducting transition, can often be checked by measuring the changes in\nthe optical absorption up to \u03c9 \u2248 20\u221230Tc3 (as compared\nto the more challenging \u03c9 \u2192 \u221e).\nThus the prediction by Hirsch,4 of an apparent sum\nrule violation in the cuprates, came both as a surprise\nand as an unlikely possibility. His suggestion was motivated by the possibility of superconductivity driven by\nkinetic energy lowering (compared with the paradigm\nprovided by the BCS theory of conventional, potential\nenergy-driven superconductivity). These ideas were motivated by the so-called hole mechanism of superconductivity that had originated a few years earlier.5,6 Around\nthe same time Anderson and coworkers7 advanced similar ideas, but with specifically interplanar kinetic energy\nlowering. This was known as the Inter-layer Tunneling\n(ILT) Theory.\n\nII.\n\nTHE EXPERIMENTS\n\nSeven years after Hirsch's prediction, Basov and\ncoworkers8 measured an apparent c-axis sum rule violation in Tl2 Ba2 CuO6+x (Tl2201). Around this time,\nhowever, the ILT theory became untenable because it\ncould not account for the condensation energy.9,10,11 Theoretical work at this time12 clarified that the sum rule\nviolation should occur in the in-plane response. This\nwas followed by a number of experiments that probed\nthe in-plane optical sum rule, as a function of temperature, for a variety of cuprate materials. For example, in Refs. 13,14,15,16,17, anomalies were found in\nboth/either the normal state temperature dependence\nand and/or the transition into the superconducting state.\nOne group18 remains unconvinced that any anomalous\nbehaviour exists in YBa2 Cu3 O6.9 , although controversy\nstill surrounds this issue.19,20\nBefore we summarize the anomalous behavior observed, we first write down Kubo's single band sum rule.\nIt is\nZ\n2h\u03042 +\u221e\n2 X \u2202 2 \u01ebk\nW (T ) = 2\nnk ,\nd\u03bd Re [\u03c3xx (\u03bd)] =\n\u03c0e 0\nN\n\u2202kx2\nk\n(1)\nwhere the left hand side is proportional to the integrated\nconductivity (real part) arising solely from intraband\ntransitions. This conductivity has its strongest intensity\nat low frequencies; nonetheless the integration extends to\ninfinite frequency, where 'long tail' contributions can be\nsignificant. In practice experimenters must cut off this\nintegration in their data at some finite frequency (typically 1-2 eV), where they believe most of the contribution\nhas been accounted for, and, at the same time, interband\ncontributions have not been included. The right-handside (RHS) of this equation involves only single particle\nproperties, namely the second derivative of the dispersion relation, and the single particle occupation number,\nnk . The RHS has been identified with the kinetic energy\nassociated with the single band. This is because in the\nspecial case of a nearest neighbour tight-binding model,\nthe RHS is proportional to the kinetic energy < K >,\n< K >=\n\n2 X\n\u01eb k nk .\nN\nk\n\n(2)\n\n\f2\nThus, specifically in the case of nearest neighbour hopping only, we have, in two dimensions12 ,\n\n321.0\n\nObserved Anomalous Behaviour\n(a) INcrease in W(T) in superconducting state\n\n320.8\n\n2\n\n(b) STRONG T dependence observed\nin the normal state (not shown)\n\n(3)\n\nNote that for parabolic bands, the single band sum\nrule looks just like the global optical sum rule, except\nthat the electron density pertains only to that contained\nwithin the single band. Obviously, for more realistic band\nstructures, the identification of the sum of the optical\nspectral weight W with the kinetic energy < K > will\nnot be precise, but it is qualitatively similar for a variety of scenarios. However, a thorough investigation was\ncarried out in Ref. 21; a qualitative distinction between\nthe two properties will occur near a van Hove singularity.\nFor the cases studied in Ref. 21 this possibility did not\nappear to be relevant for the experiments performed up\nto that time, but this distinction should be kept in mind.\nNonetheless, for the rest of this review, we will assume\nthat the kinetic energy can be identified with the optical\nspectral weight.\n\n320.6\n\nW(T) (meV)\n\nW (T ) = \u2212 < K > /2.\n\nGeneric BCS Behaviour\n\n320.4\n\n(a) decrease in W(T) in superconducting state\n(b) weak T2 dependence in the normal state\n\n320.2\n\n320.0\n0\n\n10000\n\n20000\n\n30000\n\n40000\n\nT2 (K2)\n\nIn Fig. 1 we show a schematic plot of the expected temperature dependence for the single band optical spectral\nweight. In the normal state the expected W (T ) follows\na T 2 dependence, which can be derived from a Sommerfeld expansion.22 At Tc , because kinetic energy is sacrificed in the usual BCS transition, the expected spectral weight decreases as the temperature is lowered, so a\nmarked kink occurs at Tc . In contrast the observed normal state temperature dependence is much stronger than\nexpected. Various groups have inferred this to be indicative of correlations and/or phase fluctuations (see, for\nexample, Refs. 23,24,25). A much simpler explanation\nwas suggested almost immediately,26 and was supported\nby more recent numerical and analytical work.27,28 . This\nwill be further discussed below.\n\nFIG. 1: The expected temperature dependence for the optical sum rule, given by W (T ); in the normal state W (T ) is\nexpected to be proportional to T 2 , with a small proportionality constant indicative of the smallness of the ratio T /D,\nwhere D is the electronic bandwidth. This result is plotted\nwith the solid (red) curve. In the superconducting state a decrease is expected, as indicated by the dashed (green) curve,\nthus forming a kink at Tc . The observed normal state generally has a much higher slope, and, at least for underdoped and\nsome optimally doped samples, the optical sum rule exhibits\nan increase below the superconducting transition temperature\n(indicated by the blue symbols).\n\nThe superconducting state anomaly can be viewed\nas an indication of scattering rate collapse29,30,31,32 ;\na phenomenology33 developed by the present author\nshows this most clearly, and relates the present experiment to a similar phenomenon first seen in microwave\nexperiments.34,35,36,37 . As far as we are concerned, this\nphenomenology adequately 'explains' the anomaly seen\nto occur below the superconducting transition temperature. Of course microscopic models continue to be proposed and vie for the goal of explaining superconductivity\nin the cuprates at a microscopic level. In the remaining part of this report we review recent developments\nconcerning the challenge26 that all the anomalous observations could be due to a 'cutoff effect', i.e. the noninfinite frequency cutoff used by experimentalists on the\nleft-hand-side (LHS) of Eq. (1) could be the cause of the\nanomalous temperature dependence, both in the normal\nand superconducting states.\n\nThe resolution of this possibility requires, for some of\nthe various theoretical models studied so far, an accurate\nevaluation of the LHS of Eq. (1), specifically when the\nintegration is not taken to infinite frequency. This was\ndone recently in the normal state by Norman et al.27 for\ntwo models where electrons interact with a boson. In\nboth cases they determined the optical conductivity, and\nevaluated\nZ\n2h\u03042 \u03a9c\nW\u0303app (\u03a9C ) = 2\nd\u03bd Re [\u03c3xx (\u03bd)] ,\n(4)\n\u03c0e 0\n\nIII.\n\nSOME THEORY\n\nwhich gives approximately the sum rule required in Eq.\n(1). In this way they could explore whether or not the\nstrong temperature dependence in the normal state could\nbe induced artificially by the non-infinite cutoff (as experimentalists are required to utilize). They indeed found\nthat \"...the bulk of the observed T dependence in the nor-\n\n\f3\n\nThis is shown in Fig. 2, for a variety of scattering rates,\nalong with the Mattis-Bardeen limit. A first observation\nis that the approximation Eq. (5) is remarkably accurate\nfor practically all frequencies down to 2\u22060 . We suggest\nthat Eq. (5) will serve as a simple way to characterize\notherwise complicated calculations.38,39 . A second observation, not really visible in Fig. 2, but apparent in an\nexpanded version (see Figs.6 and 7 in Ref. 28), is that the\ncorrection coming from integrating the results in Fig. 2\nup to some non-infinite cutoff (as required in the approximate optical sum rule, Eq. (4)) will be opposite to\nthe anomalous behaviour observed in experiment. This\nmeans that the observed anomaly below the superconducting transition cannot be explained by a non-infinite\nfrequency cutoff used in the experimental procedure.\nIV.\n\nanomaly that occurs below the superconducting transition temperature, and the original interpretation of this\nanomaly as a signature for a kinetic energy-driven mechanism remains viable.\n1.0\nMattis\u2212Bardeen\n\n0.8\nNormal\n\u03c31(\u03bd)/\u03c30\n\nmal state is related to the finite cutoff\". This is consistent\nwith the original suggestion (in the context of electronphonon scattering) of Karakozov et al.26 .\nKarakozov et al.26 also suggested, based on the MattisBardeen formula (dirty limit) for the conductivity in the\nsuperconducting state, that an anomalous temperature\ndependence below the superconducting transition temperature may also be due to a finite cutoff, as used in\nEq. (4). We therefore investigated this possibility in\nRef. 28.\nIn fact, for the Mattis-Bardeen limit, our numerical\nwork supports the result of Karakozov et al. However, a\nmore realistic procedure is to utilize a non-infinite scattering rate (see Refs. 38,39 for pertinent formulas).

The dashed (green) curves indicate\nthe high frequency expansions for the superconducting state\n(Eq. (5)). These are surprisingly very accurate right down to\n\u03bd = 2\u22060 . Except for the Mattis-Bardeen limit, the superconducting state crosses the normal state (not discernable on this\nfigure), a characteristic first noted by Chubukov et al.40 . This\nimplies that the sum rule correction will be opposite to that\nin the Mattis-Bardeen limit, i.e. in the direction opposite to\nthat observed in experiment.\n\nSUMMARY\nAcknowledgments\n\nA number of experimental groups have observed\nanomalies in underdoped samples of various high Tc materials. This has been interpreted as signalling new\nphysics. More specifically, in the normal state it appears\nto indicate strong correlations, or phase fluctuations, or\nboth. In the superconducting state the anomaly indicates\na new kind of 'kinetic energy-driven' superconductivity.\nModel calculations taking account of a non-infinite frequency cutoff to evaluate the sumrule indicate that the\nobservations in the normal state may be explained by\nthe use of such a cutoff, i.e. they are an artifact. On the\nother hand, the use os such a cutoff cannot explain the\n\n1\n\nR. Kubo, J. Phys. Soc.
