It has been\ndubbed the U-boson. Recent data from PAMELA [13], ATIC [14], and PPB-BETS [15]\nhave motivated considering this possibility in a new light [16, 17]. Similar scenario has been\nconsidered earlier in a different context [18]. Further modeling has appeared in Ref. [19\u201321].\nSee also [22\u201324]. We will look at how it can be probed in various experiments.\nThere are several ways that such a weakly interacting particle can arise [16]. In this article,\nwe consider the minimal setup in which the U-boson is the gauge boson of an additional\n\"dark\" U (1)d which has small kinetic mixing with the Standard Model U (1)Y . Such kinetic\nmixing can naturally arise if there are states charged under both U (1)s, even if such states\nare very heavy. This is the lowest order such coupling we can write which is consistent with\nall known symmetries of the Standard Model.\nWe survey mainly three classes of experiments: low energy (Ecm <\n\u223c 10 GeV) colliders, rare\ndecay channels at meson factories, and fixed target experiments. We find that the searches\nat both the low energy colliders and meson factories are capable of probing the parameter\nregion of interests if the coupling size is on the larger side. We collect the useful search\nchannels. At the same time, we find that carefully designed fixed target experiments, with\nthe potential of large enhancement of luminosity, offer the chance to completely cover the\ninteresting parameter region for a U-boson heavy enough to decay to two muons. We outline\nthe necessary properties of such a setup in section V.\n\nII.\n\nU-BOSON COUPLING\n\nWe consider an additional U (1)d gauge boson, a\u03bc , which is dubbed the U-boson. Its\ncoupling to the Standard Model is induced by gauge kinetic mixing with U (1)Y of the SM.\nAfter electroweak symmetry breaking, U (1)d mixes with the SM photon through\nLkin\u2212mix = \u22122\u000fFd\u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd .\n\n2\n\n(1)\n\n\fWe can eliminate this mixing by the field redefinition A\u03bc \u2192 A\u03bc + \u000fa\u03bc . At the same time, an\ninteraction with the SM charged fermions\n\u03bc\n\u000fa\u03bc JEM\n\n(2)\n\n\u03bc\nwill be generated, where JEM\nis the Standard Model electromagnetic current. U (1)d is\n\nassumed to be broken spontaneously so that the mass of the U-boson mU \u223c GeV. This\nphase transition is achieved by introducing a dark higgs hd which acquires a GeV scale vev.\nThe U-boson also couples to the SM weak neutral current, with a strength further suppressed by a factor of m2U /m2Z . At the same time, we have an order \u000f coupling between the\nSM Z-boson and the U (1)d current Jd ,\n\u2212 \u000fZ\u03bc sin \u03b8W Jd\u03bc .\n\n(3)\n\nSince U (1)d is assumed to be spontaneously broken at the GeV scale, Jd minimally contains\nthe dark higgs.\nMany closely related, but distinct, scenarios have received some attention in the literature.\nThe U-boson we consider has very small axial couplings to SM matter, so many signatures\ndiscussed in Refs. [5, 6] are not expected to apply here. Furthermore, we do not expect\nit to decay invisibly with high branching fraction, although this depends on details of the\nhidden sector. Phenomenology involving such invisible decays has been discussed in Ref.\n[25]. Scenarios where the U-boson couples in the way that we have described, but its mass\nis several orders of magnitude lighter, have distinct phenomenology as well [26].\nWe will consider the case \u000f \u223c 10\u22124 \u2212 10\u22123 . This is the natural size of this coupling if\nwe assume it originates from loops of heavy particles. Parametrically, this is \u223c\n\ngY gd\n16\u03c0 2\n\n2\n\nM\nlog M\n02 ,\n\nwith M, M 0 mass scales of heavy particles coupling to the two gauge groups. While \u000f \u223c 10\u22122\nis possible if the log is large, one generally expects the scales M and M 0 to not be too\nseparated. (For instance, in a GUT model, M and M 0 would be masses of different members\nof the same GUT multiplet. These would both be near the GUT scale, not GUT and TeV\nrespectively.)\nIt is also roughly the interesting range for this scenario to explain the DAMA signal\n[27] when the U-boson is embedded in a scenario with inelastic dark matter [16, 28], which\n3\n\n\fdetermines the quantity \u03b1D \u000f2 where \u03b1D is the coupling in the dark sector. The range that\n\u00012\nU\n. A more detailed discussion\nexplains DAMA, for \u03b1D \u2248 \u03b1, is roughly \u000f \u223c 10\u22124 1 mGeV\nappears in Ref. [24].\n\nIII.\n\nREACH OF U-BOSON SEARCHES AT LOW ENERGY HIGH LUMINOSITY\n\nCOLLIDERS\n\nIn this section, we examine the constraints and discovery potential for the U-boson at\nGeV-scale collider experiments. The U-boson couples dominantly to JEM . Its production at\ncolliders is identical to that of the photon, although with a much suppressed rate. Therefore,\nany experiment which produces a large number of energetic photons will have a chance to\nproduce and detect U-bosons as well.\nBefore a detailed numerical study, we present an order of magnitude estimate of the reach\nat such low energy colliders (including BaBar, Belle, and BEPC). The U-boson signal comes\nfrom the production process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3U , followed by U \u2192 `+ `\u2212 . We denote the rate of\nthis signal process \u03c3s . The analogous QED process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 has a rate \u03c30 \u223c \u03c3s /\u000f2 . The\nmain background in this case is QED process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3`+ `\u2212 , with the invariant mass of the\nlepton pair m`+ `\u2212 \u223c mU . The dominant process is e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 \u03b3`+ `\u2212 , with q\u03b3 \u2217 \u223c mU .\nThe total rate for the QED background can be estimated as \u03c33 \u223c (\u03b1/\u03c0)\u03c30 log(ECM /2m` ).\nThe background rate in a window of size \u03b4m around m`+ `\u2212 = mU is\n\u2206\u03c33 \u223c\n\n\u03b1 \u03b4m\n\u03b1 \u03c3s \u03b4m\n\u03c30\n=\n.\n\u03c0 mU\n\u03c0 \u000f2 mU\n\nTherefore, with integrated luminosity L, we have\nr\np\nS\n\u000f2\nmU\n\u221a \u223c \u03c30 L p\n\u00d7 BR(U \u2192 `+ `\u2212 ).\nB\n\u03b1/\u03c0 \u03b4m\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n\u03c30 \u223c 1 \u00d7 107 fb. We conclude that with 1 ab\u22121 of integrated luminosity, we can at most\nachieve sensitivity \u000f \u2264 10\u22124 with an idealized detector (\u03b4m \u2248 1 MeV and perfect particle\nidentification efficiency) for a U boson that decays dominantly into leptons. In reality, the\ndecay branching ratio into hadronic states can be extracted from the R-value measured in\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons processes [23]. There is also another production channel e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 (U \u2192\n4\n\n\f`+ `\u2212 ), and the corresponding QED background e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 `+ `\u2212 . Although higher order\nin coupling, the rate of these processes are non-negligible due to large forward and collinear\nenhancements. However, as we will demonstrate in our careful analysis in the next section,\nsuch channels turn out to give minor enhancement of the reach at low mU and can be ignored\nfor larger mU .\nWe emphasize that, from Eq. 5, the reach on \u000f improves by a factor L1/4 with increased\nluminosity. Therefore, accumulation of statistics can only extend the reach for the U-boson\nat colliders slowly.\nWe pause here to comment on earlier low energy colliders. Many low energy resonances\nhave been discovered this way. Unfortunately, none of them has enough luminosity to discover the U-boson with such weak couplings. Previous low and medium energy lepton\ncolliders, such as DCI, SPEAR, VEPP 4, DORIS, PEP, PETRA and TRISTAN, with center of mass energy ranging from several to several tens of GeV, typically have luminosity\nof 1030 \u2212 1031 cm\u22122 s\u22121 , or 10 \u2212 100 pb\u22121 yr\u22121 . Therefore, following our estimate in Eq. 5,\nthey are insufficient to search or set an interesting bound. A similar conclusion applies to\npp colliders such as ISR. We can also estimate the production potential of the U-boson by\nscaling from the data of known profusely produced mesons. From the best measured \u03c1 decay\nbranching ratios, BR(\u03c1 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) = (4.55\u00b10.28)\u00d710\u22125 , we can estimate about 107 \u03c1 mesons\nhave been produced. However, the on-shell production rate of the U-boson is much smaller,\nby \u000f2 \u00d7 \u0393U /\u03b4Ecm , where beam energy spread \u03b4Ecm is typically 1-10 MeV. Due to its small\ncoupling to the SM fields, the U-boson is typically very narrow, \u0393U \u2264 10\u22122 keV. Therefore,\nprevious low energy collider searches do not have enough integrated luminosity to produce\nthe U-boson.\nSometimes, the interference between a resonance and continuum background can provide\nuseful search channels, as it is linearly proportional to the coupling constant. However, such a\nsignal is not available in our case. The resonance under our consideration is very narrow: \u0393U\nis much smaller than the typical detector resolution, \u03b4M \u2265 MeV. Since the main interference\neffect only exists within several widths around the resonance, such an effect is completely\nwashed out by the detector resolution.\n\n5\n\n\fA.\n\nSearch at BaBar\n\nThe reach at B-factories for a light U-boson has been previously estimated [9]; we carry\nout a more careful study and understand the mass dependence, including the processes\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 U \u03b3 with U \u2192 e+ e\u2212 , \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , or \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . For concreteness, we'll begin by discussing\nBaBar.\nBaBar collides a 9.0 GeV electron beam on a 3.1 GeV positron beam. We have simulated\nthe `+ `\u2212 \u03b3 backgrounds in MadGraph [29]. To search for a narrow resonance, it is important\nto understand the mass resolution of the detector.

The only cuts that we have applied to the\nbackground are basic geometric acceptance cuts for tracks and photons, and the requirement\nthat track pt \u2265 60 MeV and E\u03b3 \u2265 20 MeV.\nThe reach in `+ `\u2212 is significantly degraded if the U-boson mass is in the region of the\n\u03c1 resonance, because the branching fraction of U \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 is enhanced in that region. We\ncan recover some of the lost reach by doing a search in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 channel for a peak. To\ncompute the background, we use MadGraph with \u03c0 \u00b1 added as a new particle with modified\ninteractions to take into account a form factor F\u03c0 (q 2 ) for the pion-pion-photon vertex. Here\nq 2 is the virtuality of the photon, and we use the high-precision KLOE results for the form\nfactor [31]. We will consider only the range 590 MeV \u2264 mU \u2264 970 MeV. One could pursue\nsimilar studies at higher masses, but new hadronic decay modes open up and the analysis\nbecomes more complicated. In the region we consider, nearly 100% of the hadronic decays\nare to \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 except on the \u03c9 resonance (mass 782 MeV, width 8.5 MeV). The \u03c9 decays to\n\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 90% of the time and to \u03c0 0 \u03b3 9% of the time, so in this narrow region \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 constitutes\n6\n\n\f0.007\n\n0.004\n+ -\n\n0.005\n\nupper bound on !\n\nupper bound on !\n\n+ -\n\nee\n+ \u03bc\u03bc\n+ \"\"\n\n0.006\n\n0.004\n0.003\n0.002\n\n0.003\n\nee\n+ \u03bc\u03bc\n+ \"\"\n\n0.002\n\n0.001\n\n0.001\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nmU (GeV)\n\n4\n\n0\n0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5\n\n5\n\nmU (GeV)\n\n\u221a\nFIG. 1: Reach at BaBar, defined to be the value of \u000f at which S/ B = 5, as a function of the U\nmass. At left, the reach for e+ e\u2212 \u03b3, \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 \u03b3, \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3, channels; at right, the same figure with a zoom\ninto the mU \u2264 1.5 GeV region. Note that muons are a much better search channel than electrons\nat larger U masses, which is due to the large background from Bhabha scattering.\n\na relatively small fraction of all hadronic decays and the reach is significantly worse. (It could\nbe improved by searching for the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 final state only if the mass resolution achieved is\nsignificantly narrower than the \u03c9 width, which seems unlikely.)\n\u221a\nIn Figure 1 we show the reach (i.e. that \u000f for which S/ B = 5). Signal events are\ngenerated, for various choices of mU , through a simple Monte Carlo based on the explicit\nformula for d\u03c3/d cos \u03b8 in e+ e\u2212 \u2192 U \u03b3 events followed by decay of the on-shell U-boson to\n`+ `\u2212 . The same acceptance cuts and smearing are applied. We then count the number of\n\u221a\nsmeared signal events passing cuts, within a window of size \u03b4m, and compute S/ B. It is\nimportant to know the branching ratios Br(U \u2192 e+ e\u2212 ) and Br(U \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ). For this, we\nhave used the rate for \u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 versus \u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 hadrons at s\u03b3 \u2217 = mU , as extracted from the\nPDG tables of R [32]. We see from the figure that the \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 channel has better reach for\nlarger U-boson masses than the e+ e\u2212 channel which suffers from a large Bhabha scattering\nbackground at higher me+ e\u2212 .\nWe see from the figure that the reach in the \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 channel slowly rises from 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22123\nat mU = 210 MeV to about 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22123 at mU = 5 GeV. The most noticeable exception is\n\n7\n\n\fthe window around m\u03c1 , where utilizing the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mode helps to recover some the loss in\nthe reach due to suppression of the leptonic branching ratio. Note that although we take\n\u221a\nS/ B = 5 as our definition for the plot, a 5-sigma bump in a particular point in mU would\nnot constitute a 5-sigma discovery, because the bump could occur at many different values\nof mU . We won't explore the statistics of this \"trials factor\" in any detail, but caution\nthe reader to take our 5-sigma estimate as an approximation of where first evidence could\nappear, not definitive discovery.\nFor the integrated luminosity recorded at BaBar, we assume 432.89 fb\u22121 , the amount of\ndata taken on the \u03a5(4S). We could include the full recorded BaBar data by simply scaling\nup the integrated luminosity to 531.43 fb\u22121 [33], but due to the one-fourth power scaling\nof reach with luminosity, this would amount to only a 5% improvement. Data collected\nat Belle, 895 fb\u22121 [34], can also be combined. Since the kinematics and the resolution are\nsimilar, we can estimate its impact on the reach using luminosity. This would allow us to\nreach \u000f values about 25% lower than those plotted.\nFurther small improvements might be obtained by also considering the QED process\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 U . Although it is higher-order in QED, this process is not negligible because\nits cross section is strongly peaked at small values of the U-boson mass, due to the large\nforward enhancement from Bhabha scattering. The signal would be a narrow mass peak\nin two central leptons (e+ e\u2212 or \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ), while the original e+ and e\u2212 would be too forward\nto have reconstructable tracks in most events. Making the (optimistic) assumption of high\ntrigger efficiency for these events, so that we only need to apply acceptance cuts on the\nlepton tracks, we estimate that the e+ e\u2212 U (\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) channel offers a reach of \u000f \u2248 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22123\nat mU \u2248 250 MeV, a little more than a factor of two worse than the \u03b3U (\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) process\nconsidered above. At higher masses the reach compares even more unfavorably (4.2 \u00d7 10\u22123\nat 500 MeV and 8.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 at 800 MeV, for instance, more than a factor of three worse\nthan \u03b3U ). In this estimate we have only taken into account QED contributions. \u03a5 decays\n(for the 1S, 2S, and 3S) also contribute to this and similar channels, through \u03a5(1S) \u2192\n`+ `\u2212 U . In the \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 channel, the \u03a5 rate dominates: we expect that relative to QED\nit is enhanced by R(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03a5) \u00d7 BR(\u03a5 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) \u2248 (3 \u00d7 103 ) \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 10\u22122 ) = 60. The\nenhancement of the signal rate in the \u03a5 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 U (\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) channel relative to the QED\n8\n\n\fprocess e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 U (U \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) is smaller due to the large forward enhancement of\nthe latter. In any case, 601/4 is not large. Moreover, such an estimate only applies if we\nare precisely on the resonance. In practice, due to the narrowness of \u03a5(1S), \u03a5(2S), and\n\u03a5(3S) resonances, there is always an additional suppression \u223c \u0393\u03a5 /\u03b4Ebeam \u223c 10\u22122 1 . Thus,\nfor the most part, we expect that four-lepton channels are less useful than `+ `\u2212 \u03b3. However,\nfor small mU , well below the di-muon mass threshold, the e+ e\u2212 U (\u2192 e+ e\u2212 ) channel could\nbe a useful complement to the \u03b3U (\u2192 e+ e\u2212 ) search, though such events could be difficult to\ntrigger. Thus, we will leave more detailed consideration of this channel to the experiments.\nFinally, we remark on a couple of ways in which our analysis can be improved. The\ndegradation of the reach in the e+ e\u2212 channel is due to the QED Bhabha scattering. We note\nthat there should be clear angular correlation in the signal since e+ e\u2212 are the decay products\nof a vector resonance. Since no such angular correlation is expected in the background, it\nprovides one possible way to enhance the signal significance. We have used detector resolution\nas our choice of mass window. In practice, one should certainly optimize this choice to achieve\nmaximal significance.\n\nB.\n\nSimilar Existing Searches, and the HyperCP Anomaly\n\nBoth CLEO [35] and BaBar [36] have recently published searches for a light scalar A0\ndecaying to \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , arising in radiative decays \u03a5(1S) \u2192 A0 \u03b3 and \u03a5(3S) \u2192 A0 \u03b3 respectively.\nThus the signal is a narrow peak in \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 invariant mass in \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 \u03b3 events, precisely of\nthe same final states from continuum U-boson production. However, because they assume\nA0 is a scalar arising in \u03a5 decays, the analyses that have been performed do not translate\ndirectly to the limits we are interested in. In particular, in both cases data taken on the\n\u03a5(4S) (7 fb\u22121 at CLEO, 78.5 fb\u22121 at BaBar) were used to determine the background shape\nof m(\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) from continuum production. Data taken on a lighter resonance (1.1 fb\u22121 or\n(21.5 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 106 resonant decays on the \u03a5(1S) at CLEO; 122 \u00d7 106 \u03a5(3S) decays at BaBar)\nare then compared to the background shape, and limits are set on decays of the resonance\n1\n\nWe would like to thank Maxim Pospelov and Adam Ritz for very useful discussion on this point.\n\n9\n\n\fto A0 \u03b3. The underlying assumption is that the \u03a5(4S) is so much broader than the narrower\nresonances that its branching fraction to A0 \u03b3 would be negligible, and hence any \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 events\nappearing there are continuum. The final limits from BaBar are on the order of 10\u22126 for the\nproduct Br(\u03a5(3S) \u2192 A0 \u03b3) \u00d7 Br(A0 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ).\nIn these studies, the A0 is assumed to be produced in decays, not by a QED continuum\nprocess, because it couples much more strongly to the b quark than to electrons. For the\nvector U-boson we are interested in, continuum production is significant, because it couples\nto any electrically charged particle. Hence, we expect that if a peak were to show up in these\nsearches, it would be most noticeable precisely in the larger \u03a5(4S) continuum data samples\nthat have been used to determine the background shape! Nonetheless, we expect that these\nexperiments are now well-equipped to do a careful version of the analysis we propose, using\nsimilar techniques to those used in these studies. It would require a bump-hunting analysis\non the \u03a5(4S) data.\nThe BaBar analysis [36] highlights a few experimental subtleties that we have glossed\nover above. One is the efficiency for positively identifying a muon (e.g., discriminating it\nfrom a pion). If only one muon is required to be cleanly identified, \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 invariant mass on\nthe \u03a5(3S) has a clearly visible \u03c1 peak, indicating that the sample is polluted by pions. If\ntwo IDed muons are required, there is a substantial loss of efficiency at low m(\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ), but\nthe \u03c1 peak disappears. We have assumed that all muons and pions are correctly identified.\nWe don't expect that the efficiencies make a substantial difference in the reach, but this\nhighlights that our rough estimates are only a guide to approximately how well we expect\nthat the experiments can do. Similarly, the BaBar analysis finds two peaks with about 3\u03c3\nsignificance, which are not significant once the trials factor is taken into account. As we\nmentioned above, this indicates that our 5\u03c3 plots are only a guide to where first evidence\nmight be expected.\nIn this context we should also mention the HyperCP result on the decay \u03a3+ \u2192 p\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ,\nwhich found three events clustered near m(\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) = 214 MeV [37]. The event rate is compatible with Standard Model expectations, but the close clustering of masses led to suggestions\nthat the decay could involve a light boson decaying to \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 . (In particular, the HyperCP\ncollaboration estimated a 1% probability for such clustering in the Standard Model, although\n10\n\n\fthe form factors for the decay have large uncertainties.) One goal of the CLEO and BaBar\nanalyses was to constrain the existence of such a boson, if it is a pseudoscalar [10, 38]. Recently, it has been argued that despite earlier claims that the only viable interpretations were\na pseudoscalar or axial vector [10], the particular form of the U-boson's coupling (mimicking\nthat of an off-shell photon) together with limited knowledge of form factors still allow for the\npossibility of a vector explanation of HyperCP [12]. However, this required \u000f2 > 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 ,\nsomewhat larger than our expectations.\nAlthough we can't directly interpret the CLEO or BaBar results as a limit on \u000f, there\nappear to be no significant bumps in the plots available to us. Our inability to strictly\ninterpret such results as constraints on a U-boson should not prevent us from giving a rough\nestimate of how they limit \u000f if we interpret them favorably. Let's consider the CLEO study\nin slightly more detail, as it is encouraging that even this relatively small sample seems to\nbe a good probe of the U-boson. Given that CLEO set a 2.3 \u00d7 10\u22126 limit on the branching\nratio Br(\u03a5(1S) \u2192 A0 \u03b3) with A0 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 100% of the time, in a sample of 21.5 \u00d7 106 \u03a5(1S)\nmesons, we can infer that there are no more than 49.5 signal events in the 1.1 fb\u22121 sample.\n\u22123\nInterpreting the count as a direct limit on \u000f, this translates to \u000f <\n\u223c 7.5\u00d710 . If we extrapolate\n\u22123\nto the full 8 fb\u22121 sample, this would improve to \u000f <\n\u223c 4.5 \u00d7 10 (scaling by the one-fourth\npower of luminosity). We can arrive at a similar estimate by scaling our result on BaBar\nsearch in Sec.III A. The estimated reach in continuum production at BaBar for an integrated\nluminosity of 433 fb\u22121 is \u000f \u2248 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 for mU = 214.3 MeV. Scaling this to the 8 fb\u22121 at\nCLEO counting both \u03a5(1S) and \u03a5(4S), one obtains \u000f \u2248 4 \u00d7 10\u22123 . Hence we can't quite\nextrapolate from the lack of \u03a5(1S) \u2192 A0 \u03b3 signal at CLEO that the HyperCP U-boson is\nexcluded, but we expect that the full \u03a5(1S)+\u03a5(4S) sample does exclude HyperCP. A similar\nestimate suggests that the BaBar limit Br(\u03a5(3S) \u2192 A0 \u03b3) \u00d7 Br(A0 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) < 0.8 \u00d7 10\u22126\n(at the HyperCP mass) has already excluded the U-boson interpretation of HyperCP (and\n\u22123\nin fact sets a stronger bound of \u000f <\n\u223c 2.0 \u00d7 10 ). We hope that the collaborations will revisit\ntheir data and make this exclusion definitive.\n\n11\n\n\fIV.\nA.\n\nU IN MESON DECAYS\nGeneralities\n\nLow energy colliders also produced large numbers of mesons. Many mesons have decay\nchannels into photons. Therefore, they can also decay into the U-boson with branching ratio\nBR(X \u2192 Y + U ) \u2248 \u000f2 BR(X \u2192 Y + \u03b3). This is followed by U \u2192 `+ `\u2212 . In cases where\nBR(X \u2192 Y `+ `\u2212 ) are measured and consistent with the SM prediction, a simple way to\nestimate the reach on the U-boson is to demand BR(X \u2192 Y + U ) \u00d7 BR(U \u2192 `+ `\u2212 ) less\nthan xBR(X \u2192 Y `+ `\u2212 )exp , where x is determined by experimental precision and theoretical\nuncertainties. However, the U-boson should be a narrow resonance in such channels. A\ndedicated search for it should have a better reach. In the following, we will first present\nestimates of discovery reach in various channels. Then, we perform a careful analysis for\nan important channel, \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7U . The dominant background is X \u2192 Y + \u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 Y + `+ `\u2212 ,\nwhere m`+ `\u2212 = q\u03b3 \u2217 = mU . The number of events in a window of \u03b4m around m`+ `\u2212 = mU is\napproximately\nnX BR(X \u2192 Y + `+ `\u2212 )\n\n1\n\u03b4m\n,\nmU log[(mX \u2212 mY )/2m` ]\n\n(9)\n\nwhere nX is the number of X mesons which have been produced. (This assumes an approximate\n\n1\nq\u03b32 \u2217\n\ndependence on the photon virtuality, which may be altered by form factors or by\n\ndiagrams that contribute to the background but not the on-shell U-boson signal.)

We emphasize that the results presented here are only approximate order of\nmagnitude projections, designed to highlight the useful channels. Accurate reach in each\nchannel requires more careful analysis taking into account both theoretical considerations\n(such as form factors) and experimental details.\nWe briefly describe our treatment of the K + decay modes. The two body decay mode\nK + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03b3 with on-shell photon does not exist. We estimated the reach in this channel\n\n13\n\n\fby assuming BR(K + \u2192 \u03c0 + U ) ' \u000f2 \u03c0/\u03b1 \u00d7 BR(K + \u2192 \u03c0 + e+ e\u2212 ). The difference between\nBR(K + \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bd\u03b3) and BR(K + \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bde+ e\u2212 ) cannot be fully accounted for by an additional\nfactor of \u03b1/\u03c0 and the fact that K + \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bde+ e\u2212 has only been measured in the range of\nme+ e\u2212 > 145 MeV [39]. There is probably an additional factor of 10 from the form factor.\nTo be conservative, we reduced signal rate by a factor of 10 in this channel.\nWe discuss here other possible search channels, using the estimates shown in Table I as\nrough guides for the size of branching ratios and total number of produced mesons for a\ncertain channel to be competitive. In general, a search in a V \u2192 \u03b3`+ `\u2212 channel would be\nquite similar to the continuum search discussed in Section III. A challenge with such decays\nis discriminating them from the continuum QED process with initial-state radiation, so they\nhave not been studied in much detail. We start with J/\u03c8. J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3X is about a couple\nof per cent (not including \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7c (1S)). We probably have 107 J/\u03c8 [41\u201343]. Therefore, by\na rough comparison with \u03c6 decay, this channel J/\u03c8 \u2192 U + X is still probably at the level\nof \u000f \u223c 10\u22122 . Similarly, there is a channel J/\u03c8 \u2192 U e+ e\u2212 , to which the background process\nJ/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3e+ e\u2212 has branching ratio 8.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 [44], which again gives the same reach as the\ninclusive mode. The mode J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 has also been observed [45]. To be competitive\nwith \u03c6, we probably need > 1010 J/\u03c8, which will be achieved at BES-III [46]. A search for a\nU-boson for in a lower mass range, mU \u2264 50 MeV, in the U e+ e\u2212 channel has been considered\nin Ref. [8].\nNext, we discuss \u03c8(2S), of which about 14 million have been collected at the BESII detector at BEPC [47]. One possible interesting decay channel is \u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u03c7c0 \u03b3 at\nBR \u223c 10%. There is about 280 MeV of phase space. Therefore, it could be interesting to\nstart to look for a low mass, \u223c 250 MeV, U-boson in this channel.\nWe also briefly discuss \u03a5 decay. \u03a5(1S) \u2192 `+ `\u2212 U could be a potentially interesting decay\nchannel which can involve the U-boson, as we mentioned in the discussion of four-lepton final\nstates in Sec. III A. As far as we are aware the corresponding decays of the \u03a5(1S) have never\nbeen measured (though the \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b3\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 decay is observed with branching fraction at 10\u22125\nlevel [48]). \u03a5(4S) can be more interesting in this case. For example, \u03a5(4S) \u2192 BB > 96%\nand B \u2192 D0 /D\u03040 + X \u223c 62%. At the same time, the branching ratio D0 \u2192 \u03b7 + X \u223c 10%.\nThis can be an interesting source of \u03b7 mesons with 108 \u2212 109 \u03a5(4S). On the other hand,\n14\n\n\fdecay channels involving the photon, such as B 0 \u2192 \u03b3 + X \u223c 10\u22127 , are not useful at this\nstage.\nFinally, for completeness, we briefly remark on \u03c0 0 decay. From the best measured \u03c0 0\ndecay branching ratios, we can estimate probably close to 109 \u03c0 0 s have been studied in\nvarious channels. Based on our estimates, we see that it is in principle possible to probe\n\u000f down to 10\u22123 level for mU < m\u03c0 in \u03c0 \u2192 \u03b3U . Since the signal is \u03b3e+ e\u2212 , such detection\nmay have lower sensitivity due to larger backgrounds (see also [3]). The U-boson induced\ncorrection to the decay branching ratio BR(\u03c0 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 ) has also been considered [6]. However,\nthis correction is proportional to the axial couplings of U-boson to SM fermions. The Uboson considered here only acquires axial coupling through mixing with the Z, which suffers\nfrom an additional suppression of m2U /m2Z . Therefore, this channel will allow \u000f \u223c 1.\nWe have discussed signals in which a photon can be replaced by a U-boson. One can also\nconsider signals involving the dark Higgs, if it is kinematically accessible. Such signals would\nbe precisely the Higgs0 -strahlung process discussed in Ref. [23], but through a production\nmechanism like e+ e\u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8 (or \u03a5) \u2192 U hd rather than simply through an off-shell U-boson.\nHowever, in comparison with the process studied in Ref. [23], resonant production will suffer\nfrom an additional suppression of order 10\u22122 due to the spread in beam energy, as we have\ndiscussed in Section III A.\n\nB.\n\nSearching in \u03c6 Decays\n\nThe KLOE experiment has collected about 2.5 fb\u22121 of luminosity, which amounts to about\n8 billion \u03c6 mesons [49]. The \u03c6, with a mass of 1019.3 MeV, decays to \u03b7\u03b3 1.3% of the time;\nthe \u03b7 (mass 547.9 MeV) decays to \u03b3\u03b3 39% of the time. Thus we can search for \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7U at\nKLOE, or \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3 followed by \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3U . Momenta of charged tracks at KLOE are measured\nto about 0.4% accuracy [50].\nThe decays we will be interested in will be those which arise from Standard Model P \u2192 V \u03b3\nor V \u2192 P \u03b3 processes (P meaning \"pseudoscalar\" and V \"vector\"), where we replace the \u03b3\nby the new gauge boson U . The irreducible SM background will be the process where the \u03b3\n\n15\n\n\fis offshell: \u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 `+ `\u2212 . The effective interaction is:\nLV P \u03b3 = fV P \u03b3 \u000f\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2202\u03c1 V\u03c3 P.\n\n(12)\n\nWe will multiply by a form factor FV P \u03b3 \u2217 (q 2 ) to model the interaction with an off-shell photon\n(and, through this, with the new gauge boson U ), where q 2 is the photon virtuality and the\nnormalization is FV P \u03b3 \u2217 (0) = 1. Detailed discussion of form factors for many processes of this\ntype can be found in Ref. [51].\nIn general V \u2192 P transitions the differential rate to `+ `\u2212 versus the rate to on-shell \u03b3 is:\ns\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\n2\n+ \u2212\nd \u0393(V \u2192 P ` ` )\n\u03b1 |FV P \u03b3 \u2217 (q )|\n2m2` \u03bb3/2 (m2V , m2P , q 2 )\n4m2`\n, (13)\n=\n1\u2212 2 1+ 2\ndq 2 \u0393(V \u2192 P \u03b3)\n3\u03c0\nq2\nq\nq\n\u03bb3/2 (m2V , m2P , 0)\nso that if we are looking near invariant mass q 2 with resolution dq 2 the relative rate is\n\n\u03b1 dq 2\n,\n3\u03c0 q 2\n\nup to phase-space factors and an order-one form factor. On the other hand, the rate for\nproduction of an on-shell, narrow U gauge boson is:\n3/2\n(m2V , m2P , m2U )\n\u0393(V \u2192 P U )\n2 \u03bb\n= \u000f2 FV P \u03b3 \u2217 (m2U )\n.\n(14)\n\u0393(V \u2192 P \u03b3)\n\u03bb3/2 (m2V , m2P , 0)\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(Here \u03bb is the usual kinematic function \u03bb(x, y, z) = (x \u2212 ( y + z)2 )(x \u2212 ( y \u2212 z)2 ).)\n\nIn Figure 2 we present the reach of the U-boson using \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7U . Specifically, we estimate the number of background events at given m2U by taking the shape of the background\ndistribution from Eq. 13 and normalizing it to the PDG branching fraction times 8 billion\ntotal \u03c6's. Given this number of background events (in a window of size given by KLOE's\nresolution on the mass), Eq. 14 was used to estimate the corresponding number of signal\n\u221a\nevents, and the value of \u000f for which S/ B = 5 is plotted. The KLOE momentum resolution of 0.4% is used (here we neglect smearing in the angular directions, which we do not\nexpect to significantly alter the results). The 5\u03c3 reach at 214 MeV is slightly worse than our\nback-of-the-envelope estimate: about 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 . Different choices of form factor significantly\nmodify the reach near the upper end of the kinematically accessible range for mU , but have\nlittle effect at the low end. The kink in the curve just above 0.2 GeV is from the sudden\ndrop in U \u2192 e+ e\u2212 branching fraction when the \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 decay mode opens up. At around 0.28\nGeV, the decay to \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 opens up. We estimate its branching ratio using a vector meson\n16\n\n\f\u03a6 -> \u0397 U -> \u0397 e+ e- Reach at KLOE\n\n\u03a6 -> \u0397 U -> \u0397 l+ l- Reach at KLOE\n0.007\n\n0.007\n\n0.006\n\n0.006\n\n0.005\n\u0395 H5 \u03a3L\n\n\u0395 H5 \u03a3L\n\n0.005\n0.004\n0.003\n\n0.004\n0.003\n\n0.002\n\n0.002\n\n0.001\n\n0.001\n\n0.000\n0.0\n\n0.000\n0.0\n\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\nMass of U HGeVL\n\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\nMass of U HGeVL\n\nFIG. 2: Reach for U \u2192 e+ e\u2212 at KLOE in the process \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7U .

[52].

The branching fraction to pions remains small (\u2248 14%)\neven at mU \u2248 m\u03c6 \u2212 m\u03b7 , so this mode has only a small effect on the reach.\nAfter the di-muon threshold, the combined reach of e+ e\u2212 and \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 is similar to the e+ e\u2212\nreach below the threshold.\n\nV.\n\nFIXED TARGET EXPERIMENTS\n\nLet's consider a different option: in a fixed target experiment, instead of trying to produce\nthe U-boson in scattering or in a rare decay, we can let electrons propagate through some\nlength of material. Rarely, an electron-proton interaction will produce a U-boson. We won't\nbe able to isolate electrons in an EM shower well enough to resolve a peak in m(e+ e\u2212 ), but\nif we have good muon identification and momentum resolution we might hope to place a\nmuon detector outside the target and find the U mass peak in \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 . In this section we\n17\n\n\fwill examine whether any existing fixed target experiments have the capability to discover\nthe U-boson, and estimate the properties we would want to have in an ideal fixed target U\nsearch experiment.\nWe consider the process e\u2212 p \u2192 e\u2212 U p, followed by U \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 . Electrons are incident on\na fixed target at a rate of \u1e45e . For an electron beam with ne electrons per bunch and bunch\nspacing \u03c4 , \u1e45e = ne /\u03c4 . The target, with thickness L and density \u03c1, is made of material of\natomic number Z and atomic weight A. The instantaneous luminosity of electron-proton\ncollisions is\ndL\n= \u1e45e nX0 X0 NA (Z/A),\ndt\n\n(15)\n\nwhere X0 is the radiation length. The number of radiation lengths of the target nX0 is\ndetermined by the thickness of the target as \u03c1L = nX0 X0 . NA = 6.02 \u00d7 1023 atom/mol is\nAvogadro's number. Radiation lengths X0 in some materials are: helium, 94.3 g cm\u22122 ; iron,\n13.8 g cm\u22122 ; lead, 6.4 g cm\u22122 . For an idealized example, consider an electron beam similar\nto that used at BaBar, with 2.1 \u00d7 1011 electrons per bunch and bunch spacing \u03c4 = 4.2 ns.1\nWe can achieve an instantaneous luminosity of nX0 \u00d7 1.9 \u00d7 1043 cm\u22122 s\u22121 on an iron target.\nThis is certainly a large enhancement in comparison with the instantaneous luminosity on\nthe order of 1033 to 1034 cm\u22122 s\u22121 at BaBar.\nTreating the proton approximately as a point particle 2 , the signal rate can be estimated\n1\n\n2\n\nOne reason this is idealized is that bunches at BaBar can circle the ring repeatedly, whereas a bunch\nincident on a fixed target is not so easily recycled. Hence delivering a similar number of electrons at such\nshort bunch spacing on a fixed target is probably unrealistic. As we will discuss, readout rates are another\nlimiting factor, and by the end of this section we will arrive at a more realistic estimate.\nThe process under consideration produces U-bosons moving forward with approximately the beam energy.\nWhen the beam energy is much larger than mU , the momentum exchanged in the process is suppressed\nbelow mU . The momentum exchange at which scattering begins to resolve nuclear substructure is set by\nthe nuclear radius R \u2248 A1/3 fm (e.g., R\u22121 is about 50 MeV for iron). Thus the regime where the electron\nscatters coherently off the whole nucleus, and \u03c3 \u221d Z 2 rather than \u221d Z, is more important than that where\nthe substructure of an individual proton is resolved. For the rough order-of-magnitude estimates we do\nhere, we will neglect this factor. (The change in reach is Z 1/4 at fixed luminosity, which is not a large\nfactor.) Note also that for larger masses, the cross section scales as 1/m2U , in addition to form-factor effects.\nAfter the initial version of this paper, a detailed calculation of production processes and a discussion of\nvarious fixed-target designs has appeared in Ref. [53]. We refer the reader there for detailed discussion of\nnuclear form factors, the Weisz\u00e4cker-Williams approximation to production, and many related issues.\n\n18\n\n\fto be \u03c3sep = \u000f2 \u03c30ep \u223c 1 pb = 10\u221236 cm2 for \u000f \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 . \u03c30ep = 10\u221230 cm2 is the cross\nsection for photon production e\u2212 p \u2192 \u03b3e\u2212 p. The background is e\u2212 p \u2192 e\u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 p through\nan off-shell photon, with a rate \u03b1\u03c0 \u03c30ep \u00d7\n\ndL\n,\ndt\n\nwhich is much bigger than the signal. Note that\n\nfor this process in a fixed-target experiment, unlike the processes we considered at BaBar,\nthere is a strong enhancement in the rate because we can allow the U boson to be forward.\nIn particular, on an iron target, there will be on the order of\n!\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013\u0012\n\u0013\nnbkgd\nne\nX0\nZ\n55.8\n\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212\n\u223c 10 \u00d7 nX0 \u00d7\n.\nbunch\n2 \u00d7 1011\n13.8 g cm\u22122\n26\nA\n\n(16)\n\n2\nbackground \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 pairs per bunch. The high combinatorial background, \u223c (nbkgd\n\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) , can\n\nseriously degrade the signal. We can choose to either use a less intense beam ne \u223c 1010 , or a\nthinner target nX0 \u223c 0.1 (about 0.18 cm for an iron target) to effectively achieve nbkgd\n\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 < 1.\nIn the case of a thinner target, one would want something resembling a typical collider\ndetector outside the material: we must be able to measure tracks from charged particles\nemerging from the material. Then a calorimeter will stop the many electrons and photons\nthat emerge, while muons pass through to some further detector which can ID them as\nmuons and allow matching to the track measured in the inner detector. This matching is\ncomplicated by the fact that muons passing through the absorber will change direction due\nto their interactions with the material, and there are many candidate tracks that they might\nmatch to. This is potentially a limiting factor on the resolution3 (and may prove to be the\nlargest experimental difficulty in this setup), but we will leave a more thorough consideration\nto future work.We show a schematic of the experimental setup in Figure 3.\nMuons passing through dense material will lose energy due to ionization, which can degrade the resolution. The Bethe-Bloch estimate for energy lost by a minimum-ionizing muon\nfrom ionization in a medium is, roughly,\n\u0012 \u0013\ndE\n\u2248 1.5 MeV cm2 g\u22121 \u00d7 X0 ,\n\u03b4E \u223c X0 \u00d7\ndx min\n\n(17)\n\nand muons at the energies we consider are minimum-ionizing to good approximation.

As we have seen, energy resolution of a typical muon detector is\n\u03b4E \u223c several MeV. If we require the degradation of resolution due to ionization not to be\nworse than the detector resolution, we would use target of thickness less than nX0 \u223c 0.1,\nwhich is in the same range as we obtained by requiring no background pile-up.\nWith no pile-up (i.e. no more than one expected \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 pair per bunch), the signal\nsignificance of a fixed target experiment is\nS\n\u221a ' \u000f2 \u00d7 BR(U \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) \u00d7\nB\n\nr\n\np\ndL\n\u2206T \u00d7 \u03c30ep \u00d7\ndt\n\nr\n\n\u03c0 mU\n,\n\u03b1 \u03b4m\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u2206T is the run time. \u03b4m\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 is proportional to the thickness of the material if the\nionization energy loss dominates the error in muon momentum measurement. In this case,\nthe signal significance is not sensitive to the thickness. However, as we have argued above,\nrequiring no pile up already restricts us away from this regime, and the resolution will be\ndetermined by the muon detector. In this case, the signal significance is proportional to\nthe square root of the thickness. Supposing we use an iron target with thickness nX = 0.1\n20\n\n\f(0.18 cm), a BaBar-like electron beam, and \u2206T similar to BaBar run time, we can expect\nan improvement up to \u000f \u223c 10\u22126 .\nHowever, another important limitation can come from the maximal event recording rate,\nRmax . For detectors at modern high energy colliders, typically, Rmax \u223c 102 Hz. However,\nthe read-out rate at lower energy detectors can be as high as 105 Hz (see e.g. Ref. [55]).\nIn principle, since we require much less information, basically only invariant mass m\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ,\nto carry out the dedicated search for the U-boson, further significant improvements are\nconceivable. We would hope that a significant portion of the analysis could be carried out\nin hardware for maximum rate.\nThe setup can only be designed so that the rate of QED background e\u2212 p \u2192\ne\u2212 p\u03b3 \u2217\n\n\u2192\n\ne\u2212 p\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , is not larger than Rmax , since any pre-scaling will lead to worse\n\ndegradation of the signal. In this case, this signal rate is\nRsignal '\n\n\u03c0\u000f2\nRmax ,\n\u03b1\n\n(19)\n\nand the significance is\nr\nS\nRsignal mU \u221a\n\u221a ' \u221a\n\u2206T\nRmax \u03b4m\nB\nr\n\u221a\n\u03c0\u000f2 mU p\nRmax \u2206T .\n=\n\u03b1\n\u03b4m\nTherefore, the required running time \u2206T for some desired precision is\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2206T\n1 1\n\u03b4m\nHz\n' 4 12\n.\nyear\n\u000f 10\nRmax\nmU\n\n(20)\n\n(21)\n\nWe see that for Rmax \u223c 105 Hz, which corresponds to an instantaneous luminosity on the\norder of 1038 cm\u22122 s\u22121 , we can reach to about \u000f \u223c 10\u22125 . We have dropped a number of orderone factors, not to mention experimental efficiencies, so conservatively one should interpret\nthis as a few \u00d710\u22125 .\nAs a sanity check on these numbers, we should consider the luminosity that has been\nachieved at existing fixed-target experiments. For instance, a SLAC beam-dump experiment\nthat searched for millicharged particles involved 3 \u00d7 1010 electrons on 6 radiation lengths of\na tungsten/rhenium target at a rate of 120 Hz [56]. This corresponds to an instantaneous\n21\n\n\fluminosity on the order of 1037 cm\u22122 s\u22121 . In fact, this experiment already can set interesting\nlimits on certain U-boson scenarios [57]. A recent study of deeply virtual Compton scattering\nat JLab Hall A used a 5.75 GeV electron beam on a liquid D2 target, with 4 \u00d7 1037 cm\u22122\ns\u22121 /nucleon luminosity [58] . Experiments involving parity-violating electron scattering from\nnuclei at MIT-Bates, JLab, and Mainz have used luminosities greater than 1038 cm\u22122 s\u22121 ,\nas reviewed in Ref. [59]. In particular, JLab Hall A can reach a luminosity of 5 \u00d7 1038 cm\u22122\ns\u22121 [55]. Based on these examples, we conclude that a luminosity 105 times higher than that\nof BaBar is not unrealistic.\nWe also briefly comment on other possible beams. Because the only prerequisite for\nproducing a U-boson is an electromagnetically interacting particle, we expect that proton\nor pion beams incident on fixed targets can also produce U-bosons, with cross sections\ncomparable to those obtained with electron beams. However, the larger total \u03c0p and pp\ninteraction cross-sections could lead to more difficulty isolating a clean signal. Furthermore,\nfixed target experiments with hadronic beams typically have lower luminosities than we\nrequire. For instance, the charmonium experiment E835 at FNAL used an antiproton beam\nand recorded typical instantaneous luminosities of 2\u00d71031 cm\u22122 s\u22121 [60]. As another example,\nthe proton beam used at HyperCP involved only on the order of 1010 protons per second\n[61]. Hence, we expect that the very high luminosities we require are most easily achieved\nwith electron beams.\n\nA.\n\nLong Lifetimes\n\nIn the above discussion, we have argued that a dedicated fixed target experiment can\nreach values of \u000f on the order of 10\u22125 . At such small values of \u000f, it becomes interesting\nto consider the lifetime of the U-boson, which may travel a macroscopic distance before\ndecaying. (Parametrically, the decay length c\u03c4 \u223c \u000f\u22122 \u03b1m\u03c0 U .) We gain new reach by observing\nthat Standard Model background will consist of muons originating within the target while\nthe decay of the U-boson can happen within the tracking system. We have discussed using\na target with thickness on the order of 0.1 radiation lengths, which for iron is 1.8 mm.\nThus lifetimes \u03b3c\u03c4 on the order of millimeters to centimeters or longer could potentially\n22\n\n\fValue of \u0395 for which c\u03a4 = 1 mm\n0.001\n10-4\n\n\u0395\n\n10-5\n10-6\n10-7\n10-8\n\n0.1 0.2\n0.5 1.0 2.0\nMass of U HGeVL\n\nFIG. 4: The value of \u000f at which the decay length c\u03c4 becomes 1 millimeter, as a function of the\nU-boson mass mU . The dashed horizontal line at 10\u22125 indicates roughly the lowest \u000f we could hope\nto probe with a fixed-target experiment designed for prompt decays.\n\nbe probed by reconstructing tracks that originate outside the target. The boost of the Uboson, \u03b3 \u223c Ebeam /mU \u001d 1, improves the prospects (so in particular, more energetic beams\ncan help produce more highly displaced vertices). In Figure 4, we plot the value of \u000f at\nwhich c\u03c4 = 1 mm as a function of the U-boson mass. At low masses this is \u000f \u223c 10\u22125 ,\nfalling closer to 10\u22126 as the U-boson mass approaches 1 GeV. Below this value of \u000f, we\nexpect that the Standard Model background becomes very low. One source is conversion\nof real photons to \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 pairs in material, so one would want a tracker containing very few\nradiation lengths of material (the spatial distribution of vertices could perhaps also help\ndistinguish conversions from decays). There would also be some chance of tracks being\nmisreconstructed to produce fake displaced vertices. These effects can only be estimated\ngiven a specific experimental design. Depending on the experimental details, \u000f below 10\u22127\ncould be reached in this way. In this way experiments could potentially cover the entire\n<\ninteresting range of \u000f for 2m\u03bc <\n\u223c mU \u223c 1 GeV, but as mU grows closer to 1 GeV it is possible\n< \u22125\nthat there is a window of 10\u22126 <\n\u223c \u000f \u223c 10 that might not be reached by the methods we\n23\n\n\fpropose.\n\nVI.\nA.\n\nOTHER POSSIBLE PROBES OF THE U-BOSON\nHigh-Energy Colliders\n\nHere we will briefly consider the production of the U boson at high-energy (i.e. order\n100 to 1000 GeV) collider experiments. First, note that any process we consider will involve\nthe same comparison of a signal rate S \u2248 \u000f2 N , where N is roughly the number of events in\na corresponding Standard Model process involving photons, with a background rate near a\ngiven bin B \u2248\n\n\u03b1 \u03b4m\nN.\n\u03c0 mU\n\nSuch an estimate tells us that to probe \u000f \u2248 10\u22123 , we always want N\n\nto be of order one billion or more.\nThe first high-energy collider to consider is LEP. At LEP, the event rate was simply\ntoo small. LEP 1 recorded a total of 17 million Z bosons among all of the experiments\n(corresponding to approximately 200 pb\u22121 /experiment), whereas LEP 2 delivered 200 pb\u22121\nof luminosity at each of 7 different energies from 189 GeV to 207 GeV, where the cross\nsection is much smaller than on the Z pole [62]. From this we see that combining all of\n9\nLEP's data, even before focusing on events containing a photon, we do not achieve N >\n\u223c 10 .\nThere is a Z rare decay channel, BR \u223c \u000f2 , into the dark sector. Depending on the model,\nit can either result in 1 lepton jet + E\n6 T , or a pair of lepton jets and possibly additional E\n6 T\n[20]. Given that LEP has produced about 17 million Zs, there should be a possible signal\nor constraint for the coupling roughly on the order of \u000f \u223c 10\u22123 already, if this particular\nconfiguration is searched for.\nNext we consider the Tevatron, where the two experiments have recorded about 10 fb\u22121\nof total data. With an average instantaneous luminosity of around 2 \u00d7 1032 cm\u22122 s\u22121 and\na trigger rate of about 50 Hz [63, 64], we estimate that the two experiments together have\naround 5 \u00d7 109 total events on tape, and will add billions more by the end of their runs.\nMost of this rate does not involve events with isolated photons. The prompt central photon\nrate at the Tevatron is about 30 pb/GeV per unit rapidity at p\u03b3t \u2248 30 GeV [65], increasing\ntoward smaller pt . We can crudely estimate that the rate for photons with pt between 20\n\n24\n\n\fand 35 GeV is on the order of several nb, with perhaps on the order of 107 events on tape.\nHence the analogous process with a U boson produced in this range is not very useful for\nprobing \u000f on the order of 10\u22123 . Very soft photons are more plentiful, but one typically needs\nsome harder object in the event to trigger on.\nOn the other hand, there is still some hope of an interesting search at the Tevatron. We\nhave on the order of a billion events to work with, and most of the events that have triggered\nwill contain some jet activity. Inside these jets, there are numerous charged particles. Just\nas a high-energy quark can radiate not only gluons but also photons in the parton shower,\nit can radiate U-bosons if they are sufficiently light. Thus it might be worthwhile to look\nfor \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 pairs inside a jet, although we expect that contamination from backgrounds and\ndifficulty obtaining good resolution on the track momenta will make this a poor competitor\nto the searches at high-luminosity GeV-scale experiments like BaBar, Belle, and KLOE.\nThe Large Hadron Collider is more useful due to its high intensity, L = 1033 \u22121034 cm\u22122 s\u22121 ,\nand the large parton density at smaller x. Therefore, a larger production rate, \u223c \u000f2 \u00d7prompt\nphoton rate, is expected. Detailed studies with realistic background and detector simulations\nhave yet to be carried out. We expect that it should be possible to reach \u000f \u223c 10\u22123 . For\ndetails, see [20].\nIn comparison, several other medium to high energy colliders do not have the necessary\nluminosities to produce the U-boson under our consideration. They include: SPS, pp\u0304 with\nEcm = 630 GeV and L = 2\u00d71030 cm\u22122 s\u22121 ; ISR, pp with Ecm = 64 GeV and L = 1031 cm\u22122 s\u22121 ;\nSLC, Ecm ' 100 GeV, L = 2.5 \u00d7 1030 cm\u22122 s\u22121 ; and HERA, e (30 GeV) on p (920 GeV),\nL = 7.5 \u00d7 1031 cm\u22122 s\u22121 .\n\nB.\n\nScattering with Gamma Rays\n\nAnother option is to consider the process e\u2212 \u03b3 \u2192 e\u2212 U . However, it is easy to see that\ncurrent facilities do not offer a reasonable chance to probe this channel. Because we want\na center of mass energy on the order of hundreds of MeV or a few GeV, light sources that\nsupply hard X-rays are insufficient; one would need a gamma ray source. Gamma rays are\nproduced by Compton backscattering of relativistic electrons from lasers in the LEGS facility\n25\n\n\fat Brookhaven [66] and the HI\u03b3S facility at Duke [67], at rates on the order of 106 to 108\nphotons per second collimated in spots of about 1 cm. Such beams are insufficient for our\npurposes.\n\nC.\n\nOther low energy probes\n\nFor completeness, we briefly comment on other possible low energy probes.\nQED precision measurements provides useful low energy probes of the U-boson. The\ncorrection due to the exchange of the U-boson is controlled by the ratio of the range of\nthe U-boson mediated force and the size of system used for measurement, rQED\ntypically on the order of\n\nSYS. .\n\nIt is\n\n1\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013p\n\nm\u22121\nU\nrQED\n\n\u00d7 \u000f2 e2 ,\n\n(22)\n\nSYS.\n\nwhere power p depends on the system. For example, for the transitions between lower\nlying states of hydrogen, rQED\n\nSYS.\n\n\u223c \u03b1 \u00d7 10 eV\u22121 and p ' 2 2 . Therefore, although such\n\ntransitions have been measured to a very accurate level [68, 69], they still at most restrict\n\u000f \u223c 10\u22121 . Therefore, it is useful to consider systems with much smaller size. The most\nuseful among them is the measurement of g\u03bc \u2212 2 [70]. Based on that, Ref. [12] found an\nupper bound \u000f2 < 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 (mU /100 MeV)2 ; see also [4]. An experiment under way using\nmuonic hydrogen [71] can in principle be sensitive to \u000f, although eventually the reach will be\nlimited by theoretical uncertainties [72] to somewhat better than about \u000f \u2264 10\u22122 . Currently,\nhowever, the error in theoretical prediction is dominated by proton charge radius\n\n3\n\nwhich\n\nleads to a weaker bound at the level of \u000f \u223c 10\u22121 . Ref. [12] also found the low energy\nelectron proton scattering, which is also sensitive to the charge radius of proton, leads to\n\u000f2 < 4 \u00d7 10\u22123 (mU /100 MeV)2 .\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nWe are particularly grateful to Bob Jaffe for illuminating discussions on precision QED tests, especially\nregarding the limits from muonic hydrogen.\nThe presence of the U-boson introduces a perturbation of \u03b1e\u2212mU r /r. The shift in ground state energy\nof the hydrogen atom is about \u03b4E/E \u223c (aB \u03bc)\u22122 , where \u03bc = mU + 2/aB and aB is the Bohr radius.\nTherefore, p = 2. Higher energy levels, in particular those with higher angular momentum, will typically\nreceive a correction with p \u2265 2.\nIn fact, such experiments are designed give precise measurement of proton charge radius.\n\n26\n\n\fLow q 2 elastic \u03bde scattering [73] can be used to set bounds on low energy U-bosons as\ndiscussed by Ref. [5], g\u03bdU geU /m2U < GF . However, in our case, the U-boson coupling to the\nweak neutral current is suppressed by an additional factor of (mU /mZ )2 . Therefore, the\nconstraint will be \u000f2 e2 /m2Z < GF , which implies at most \u000f \u2264 1.\nAtomic parity measurements can constrain the properties of the U-boson[5, 74]. It needs\nU U\nboth axial and vector coupling, geA\ngqV < 10\u22123 GF . In our case, the axial coupling can only\n\ncome from mixing with the Z and is again suppressed by a factor of (mU /mZ )2 . Therefore,\nwhile maybe slightly stronger than \u03bde scattering, the bound from atomic parity measurements is about \u000f < 10\u22121 .\n\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper, we have investigated the present constraints and possibility of further experimental searches for a very weakly coupled U (1)d gauge boson, with mass mU \u223c 100s MeV\nto 1 GeV. We mainly focused on a set of low energy experiments, including low energy high\nluminosity lepton colliders, rare meson decay channels, and fixed target experiments. We\nfound that while previous experiments lack the necessary luminosity to put useful limits on\nthe coupling in the range of 10\u22123 \u2212 10\u22124 , a set of current experiments should have the ability\nto probe the upper part of this parameter region. In particular, we urge BaBar and Belle to\nsearch for narrow peaks in e+ e\u2212 \u2192 `+ `\u2212 \u03b3 and e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 (near the \u03c1), KLOE to search\nin \u03c6 decays for narrow \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 resonances, and BES-III to search in J/\u03c8 decays.\nThe smallest coupling \u000f that is probed scales as L\u22121/4 . We argue that the best way to\nachieve a much higher luminosity is to design a specific low energy fixed target experiment to\nprobe U-bosons with mass above 2m\u03bc . We discuss desired properties of such an experiment.\nSpecifically, it is beneficial to use a thinner target, about 0.1 radiation length. The optimal\nreach in this case is about 10\u22126 . At the same time, an important limitation can be the\nmaximal rate at which relevant information of the event can be recorded, Rmax . The \u000f reach\n\u22121/4\n\nscales as Rmax . At a rate of 105 Hz, which is possible, the reach on \u000f is reduced to 10\u22125 .\nHowever, searches for long-lived U-bosons decaying outside the target can probe a range of \u000f\nat or below 10\u22125 , depending on mU and experimental resolutions. We are optimistic that in\n27\n\n\fthis way dedicated fixed-target experiments can rule out or a discover a U-boson over nearly\nthe entire interesting range.\n\nAcknowledgements\nFirst and foremost, we thank N.

At this point the only cuts imposed on the leptons and photon are basic acceptance\ncuts on cos \u03b8 (the tracks must be within the fiducial volume of the drift chamber, and the\nphoton must hit the central electromagnetic calorimeter), pt for tracks (at least 60 MeV),\nand E for the photon (at least 20 MeV). We assume there is no significant inefficiency for\ndetecting tracks and photons passing these cuts, and no significant fake rates. With these\nassumptions, the root-mean-square mass resolution \u03b4m is plotted against m(`+ `\u2212 ) in Figure\n28\n\n\f5.

The difference in resolution\nfor electrons and muons is small but persists as we simulate larger event samples, so it\nappears to be due to the way the muon mass enters the invariant mass reconstructed from\nthe tracks.
