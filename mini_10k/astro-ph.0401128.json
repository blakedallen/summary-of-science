Accurate abundance measurements require the determination of\nthe electron temperature, which in turn is usually obtained\nfrom the ratios of auroral to nebular line intensities, such as\n[O iii] \u03bb4363/\u03bb5007. This is often referred to as the 'direct'\nTe method. A well-known difficulty, however, arises from the\nfact that, as the metallicity increases, the electron temperature decreases (since the cooling is via metal lines) and the\nauroral lines eventually become too faint to measure. Detailed modelling can overcome this problem. For example,\nKewley & Dopita (2002) have recently used a combination\nof stellar population synthesis and photoionization models\nto develop a set of ionization parameter and abundance diagnostics based only on the strong optical emission lines.\nTheir 'optimal' method uses ratios of [N ii], [O ii], [O iii],\n[S ii], [S iii] and the Balmer lines, that is the full complement\nof strong nebular lines accessible from the ground. They also\nrecommended procedures for the derivation of abundances\nin cases where only a subset of these lines is available.\nThe advent of 8-10 m class telescopes has made it possible to extend observations of these lines to galaxies at high\nredshifts (e.g. Teplitz et al. 2000; Pettini et al. 2001; Kobulnicky et al. 2003; Lilly, Carollo, & Stockton 2003; Steidel\net al. 2004). At high redshift, however, the study of nebular\nemission encounters new obstacles. The first and obvious difficulty is that, given the much larger distances involved, the\nline fluxes are reduced dramatically. The problem is compounded by the fact that the lines are redshifted into the\nnear-infrared wavelength region, where the sky background\nis orders of magnitude higher than in the optical. Second,\nat a given redshift only a subset of the strong lines will fall\nwithin an atmospheric window and thus be accessible from\nthe ground. Even at particularly favourable redshifts, such\n\nas z \u2243 2.3 which shifts [O ii], [O iii] and H\u03b2, and H\u03b1 and\n[N ii] respectively into the middle range of the J, H and\nK bands, it is not possible to record all these lines in a\nsingle exposure. Rather, different spectrograph settings are\nnormally required, and this can easily introduce additional\nerrors in the relative flux calibrations. For all of these reasons, there are practical limitations to the accuracy with\nwhich emission line ratios can be measured in high redshift\nobjects.\nThere is thus an incentive to explore simpler abundance\nindicators based on only a few emission lines-preferably\nclose in wavelength-which, while admittedly less accurate\nthan the full treatments mentioned above, may still be adequate to characterise the chemical enrichment of distant\ngalaxies. The idea of such indicators goes back to a fundamental paper by Searle (1971) who, noting some measurements of nebular [O iii] lines in M33 by Aller (1942),\nhimself found a systematic increase in [O iii]/H\u03b2 and a corresponding decrease in [N ii]/H\u03b1 with galactocentric distance as a generic property of giant H ii regions in late-type\nspiral galaxies. Searle pointed out that these trends were\nmost likely due to radial abundance gradients, thereby raising the possibility of using these line ratios more generally as\nindicators of abundance. Such indicators can be calibrated\nagainst more secure abundance determinations, based on auroral line measurements or on detailed photoionization models, to establish their typical accuracy; for this reason they\nare often referred to as 'empirical' methods. The first exploration of such a method was by Jensen, Strom & Strom\n(1976) who considered the ratio [O iii]/H\u03b2. The subsequent\nextension of this idea by Pagel et al. (1979), who included\n[O ii], led to the most widely used abundance indicator, the\nR23 index which relates the abundance of oxygen to the ratio of ([O ii] + [O iii]) to H\u03b2. In the last 25 years there have\nbeen many efforts to refine the calibration of R23 . The most\nsuccessful are the calibration by McGaugh (1991) which is\n\n\f2\n\nM. Pettini and B.E.J. Pagel\n\nFigure 1. Oxygen abundance against the N 2 index in extragalactic H ii regions. The symbols have the following meanings: Filled\nsquares \u2013 (O/H) from photoionisation models by D\u0131\u0301az et al. (1991 \u2013 M 51) and Castellanos, D\u0131\u0301az, & Terlevich (2002a,b \u2013 NGC 925 and\nNGC 1637). Crosses \u2013 M 101 (Kennicutt et al. 2003). Open triangles \u2013 spiral and irregular galaxies (Castellanos et al. 2002a; Garnett\net al. 1997; Gonz\u00e1lez-Delgado et al. 1994, 1995; Kobulnicky & Skillman 1996; Mathis, Chu, & Peterson 1985; Pagel, Edmunds, & Smith\n1980; Pastoriza et al. 1993; Shaver et al. 1983 [30 Dor and NGC 346]; Skillman, C\u00f4t\u00e9, & Miller 2003; V\u0131\u0301lchez et al. 1988). Open squares\n\u2013 blue compact galaxies (Campbell, Terlevich, & Melnick 1986; Garnett 1990; Izotov, Thuan, & Lipovetsky 1994; Kniazev et al. 2000;\nKunth & Joubert 1985; Pagel et al. 1992; Skillman & Kennicutt 1993; Skillman et al. 1994; Thuan, Izotov, & Lipovetsky 1995; van\nZee 2000; Walsh & Roy 1989). Error bars in log (O/H) are only plotted when they are larger than the symbol to which they refer. The\nlong-dash line is the best fitting linear relationship: 12 + log (O/H) = 8.90 + 0.57 \u00d7 N 2. The short-dash lines encompass 95% of the\nmeasurements and correspond to a range in log (O/H) = \u00b10.41 relative to this linear fit. The continuous line is a cubic function of the\nform 12 + log (O/H) = 9.37 + 2.03 \u00d7 N 2 + 1.26 \u00d7 N 22 + 0.32 \u00d7 N 23 which, however, gives only a slightly better fit to the data (95%\nof the data points are within \u00b10.38 of this line). The dot-dash horizontal line shows the solar oxygen abundance 12 + log (O/H) = 8.66\n(Allende-Prieto, Lambert, & Asplund 2001; Asplund et al. 2004).\n\nbased on photoionisation models and the empirical one by\nPilyugin (2003); both improve the accuracy by making use\nof the [O iii]/[O ii] ratio as an ionisation parameter. Even so,\nsystematic differences of up to 0.5 dex remain between the\noxygen abundances derived from the R23 index and those\ndeduced from the 'direct' Te method (e.g. Skillman, C\u00f4t\u00e9,\n& Miller 2003; Kennicutt, Bresolin, & Garnett 2003). When\ncompounded with the well-known double-valued behaviour\nof (O/H) vs. R23 , this can lead to order of magnitude uncertainties in (O/H) in galaxies at z \u2243 3 (Pettini et al. 2001).\nPartly to circumvent this latter problem, analogous\nS23 \u2261 ([S ii] + [S iii])/H\u03b2 (V\u0131\u0301lchez & Esteban 1996; Christensen, Petersen, & Gammelgaard 1997; D\u0131\u0301az & P\u00e9rezMontero 2000) and S234 \u2261 ([S ii] + [S iii]+ [S iv])/H\u03b2\n(Oey et al. 2002) indices have been proposed. Although these\nsulphur-line based indices turn over at higher metallicities\nthan R23 , the sulphur lines are weaker than their oxygen\ncounterparts and their red and infrared rest wavelengths\nplace them beyond the reach of ground-based observations\n>\nat redshifts z \u223c\n1.5.\nMore promising are methods which involve [N ii] and\nH\u03b1. In this paper we reconsider the N 2 index (N 2 \u2261\nlog{[N ii] \u03bb6583/H\u03b1}) recently discussed by Denicol\u00f3, Terlevich, & Terlevich (2002), and show how its accuracy can\n\nbe further improved in the high abundance regime by comparison with [O iii] \u03bb5007/H\u03b2.\n\n2\n\nTHE N 2 INDEX\n\nFollowing up on earlier work by Storchi-Bergmann, Calzetti,\n& Kinney (1994) and by Raimann et al. (2000), Denicol\u00f3 et\nal. (2002) have focussed attention again on the N 2 index,\npointing out its usefulness in the search for low metallicity galaxies. The [N ii]/H\u03b1 ratio is highly sensitive to the\n'metallicity', as measured by the oxygen abundance (O/H),\nthrough a combination of two effects. As (O/H) decreases\nbelow solar, there is a tendency for the ionization to increase (either from hardness of the ionizing spectrum or\nfrom the ionization parameter, or both), decreasing the ratio [N ii]/[N iii], and, furthermore, the (N/O) ratio itself decreases at the high-abundance end because of the secondary\nnature of nitrogen (e.g. Henry, Edmunds, & K\u00f6ppen 2000;\nPettini et al. 2002a). From the ground, H\u03b1 and [N ii] can\nbe followed all the way to redshift z \u2243 2.5 (the limit of\nthe K band). With thousands of galaxies now known at\nz > 1 (Madgwick et al. 2003; Steidel et al. 2004; Abraham\net al., in preparation), the N 2 index offers the means to determine metallicities in a wholesale manner over look-back\n\n\f[O iii]/[N ii] as an abundance indicator\n\n3\n\nFigure 2. Oxygen abundance against the O3N 2 index in extragalactic H ii regions. The symbols have the same meaning as in Figure 1.\nThe long-dash line is the best fitting linear relationship, 12 + log (O/H) = 8.73 \u2212 0.32 \u00d7 O3N 2, valid when O3N 2 < 1.9 The short-dash\nlines encompass 95% of the measurements which satisfy this condition and correspond to a range in log (O/H) = \u00b10.25. The dot-dash\nhorizontal line shows the solar oxygen abundance 12 + log (O/H) = 8.66 (Allende-Prieto, Lambert & Asplund 2001; Asplund et al. 2004).\n\ntimes which span most of the age of the universe. It is thus\nworthwhile reconsidering its accuracy.\nDenicol\u00f3 et al. (2002) compiled an extensive sample of\nnearby extragalactic H ii regions which could be used to calibrate N 2 vs. (O/H). We have revised their database by: (i)\nincluding only H ii regions with values of (O/H) determined\neither via the Te method or with detailed photoionization\nmodelling, and excluding the untabulated estimates for H ii\nregions from the catalogue of Terlevich et al. (1991), because\nfor many of these (O/H) had been estimated from 'empirical' (i.e. R23 or S23 ) indices; (ii) updating it with recent\nmeasurements by Kennicutt et al. (2003) for H ii regions\nin M 101 and by Skillman et al. (2003) for dwarf irregular\ngalaxies in the Sculptor Group.\nThe total sample, shown in Figure 1, consists of 137 extragalactic H ii regions with well determined values of (O/H)\nand N 2. In all but six cases (shown with filled symbols) the\noxygen abundance was determined with the Te method. References to the original works are given in the Figure caption.\nIt can be readily appreciated from Figure 1 that, while N 2\ndoes indeed increase monotonically with log (O/H), a linear\nrelationship is only an approximate representation of the\ndata, which rather tend to lie along an S-shaped curve. In\nparticular, when (O/H) \u2243 8.2\u00b10.2, the value of N 2 can span\none order of magnitude, from N 2 \u2243 \u22121.8 to N 2 \u2243 \u22120.8,\nwhereas at solar metallicity and beyond [N ii] tends to saturate (Baldwin, Phillips & Terlevich 1981) because it comes\nto dominate the cooling (Kewley & Dopita 2002). Forcing a\nlinear fit to the sample,1 we obtain a line of best fit according\nto the relation:\n\n1\n\nWe performed an unweighted least squares fit to the data because in compilations such as this the error estimates are highly\n\n12 + log (O/H) = 8.90 + 0.57 \u00d7 N 2\n\n(1)\n\nshown with the long-dash line in Figure 1. Both the slope\nand the intercept are lower than the values of the fit by\nDenicol\u00f3 et al. (2002) who proposed 12+log (O/H) = 9.12+\n0.73 \u00d7 N 2. While the formal statistical errors on the slope\nand intercept are small (0.03 and 0.04 respectively), of more\ninterest is the dispersion of the points about the line of best\nfit in Figure 1. Specifically, 95% (68%) of the measurements\nof log (O/H) lie within \u00b10.41 (\u00b10.18) of the line defined by\neq. (1); the 2\u03c3 limits are shown as short-dash lines in Figure\n1. Only a marginally better fit to the data is provided by a\nthird order polynomial of the form:\n12+log (O/H) = 9.37+2.03\u00d7N 2+1.26\u00d7N 22 +0.32\u00d7N 23 (2)\n(valid in the range \u22122.5 < N 2 < \u22120.3), with 95% (68%) of\nthe measurements being within \u00b10.38 (\u00b10.18) of the values\ngiven by eq. (2). This cubic fit is indicated by the continuous\nline in Figure 1. We conclude that with the N 2 calibrator it\nis possible to estimate the abundance of oxygen to within a\nfactor of \u223c 2.5 at the 95% confidence level. This accuracy is\ncomparable to that of the R23 method.\n\n3\n\nTHE O3N 2 INDEX\n\nWe now consider to what degree the accuracy in the determination of (O/H) can be improved by considering two ratios,\n[N ii]/H\u03b1 and [O iii]/H\u03b2. Alloin et al. (1979) were the first\nto introduce the quantity O3N 2 \u2261 log{([O iii] \u03bb5007/H\u03b2)/\n\nheterogeneous. However, a weighted least squares fit gives very\nsimilar results.\n\n\f4\n\nM. Pettini and B.E.J. Pagel\n\n([N ii] \u03bb6583/H\u03b1)},2 but since then the O3N 2 index has\nbeen comparatively neglected in nebular abundance studies. There is now a sufficient body of high quality data to\nreassess its merits. We expect the inclusion of [O iii] to be\nmost useful in the high metallicity regime where [N ii] saturates but the strength of [O iii] continues to decrease with\nincreasing metallicity.\nFigure 2 shows how O3N 2 varies with (O/H) for the 137\nextragalactic H ii regions in our sample. Clearly this method\n>\nis of little use when O3N 2 \u223c\n2, but at lower values there\nappears to be a relatively tight, linear and steep relationship\nbetween O3N 2 and log (O/H). A least squares linear fit to\nthe data in the range \u22121 < O3N 2 < 1.9 yields the relation:\n12 + log (O/H) = 8.73 \u2212 0.32 \u00d7 O3N 2\n\n(3)\n\nwhich is shown by the long-dash line in Figure 2, with 95%\n(68%) of the measurements within 0.25 (0.14) dex of the best\nfit line; the short-dash lines in Figure 2 show the 2\u03c3 limits.\nThe caveats are that the statistics are somewhat limited,\nwith only 65 out of the 137 H ii regions in our sample satisfying the condition O3N 2 < 1.9, and that the relationship\ndefined by eq. (3) relies heavily on the four data points with\n12 + log (O/H) \u2243 9.0 deduced from photoionisation models rather than the 'direct' Te method. Nevertheless, in the\nhigh metallicity regime the O3N 2 method appears promising and it would be very worthwhile extending the database\nof nearby H ii region measurements to improve its statistics.\n\n4\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this note we have reassessed the usefulness of 'empirical'\nmethods based on the [N ii]/H\u03b1 ratio for determining the\noxygen abundance in H ii regions, particularly with an eye\nto their application to the analysis of star-forming galaxies\nat high redshift. We have revised the extensive compilation\nprepared by Denicol\u00f3 et al. (2002) to include only H ii regions where the oxygen abundance is believed to be known\nreliably, either because the electron temperature has been\ndetermined with high precision, or through detailed modelling of the ionisation of the nebula. Our main conclusions\nare as follows.\n1. The relationship between N 2 \u2261 log ([N ii] \u03bb6583/H\u03b1)\nand log (O/H) is only approximately linear and yields (with\nthe revised data set considered here) estimates of (O/H)\nwhich are only accurate to within \u223c 0.4 dex at the 95%\nconfidence level. This level of precision is comparable to that\nof the more widely used R23 method.\n2. At moderate to high metallicities, greater than \u223c 1/4\nsolar, the oxygen abundance can be deduced to within a\nfactor of \u223c 0.25 dex (again at the 95% confidence level) if\nO3N 2 \u2261 log{([O iii] \u03bb5007/H\u03b2)/([N ii] \u03bb6583/H\u03b1)} is lower\nthan \u223c 1.9. The O3N 2 index is particularly useful at solar\nand super-solar metallicities, where N 2 saturates.\nWhen applied to high redshift galaxies, the N 2 and\nO3N 2 indices offer several advantages compared to the\nmore familiar R23 method. First, the N-based indices have\n2\n\nThis definition is slightly different from the original one proposed by Alloin et al. (1979) who included both [O iii] doublet\nlines in the numerator of the first ratio.\n\na monotonic behaviour with (O/H), overcoming the ambiguities introduced by the double-valued character of R23 .\nSecond, both N 2 and O3N 2 rely on ratios of emission lines\nwhich are close in wavelength, so that corrections for reddening, and accurate flux calibration of the spectra, are not\nnecessary. Third, both indices are highly sensitive to the\noxygen abundance and are thus particularly well suited to\nthe analysis of data of only moderate signal-to-noise ratio.\nSpecifically, the slope of 0.57 of the relationship between\nlog (O/H) and N 2 implies that one only needs to measure\nthe [N ii]/H\u03b1 ratio with an accuracy of about 25%. Better precision would not improve the estimate of (O/H) since\nthe random error would then be of minor importance relative to the systematic uncertainty of \u00b10.4 dex in the method.\nSimilar considerations apply to the O3N 2 index which is inherently more accurate in the high metallicity regime and\nvaries even more steeply with log (O/H).\nThe high sensitivity of O3N 2 to the oxygen abundance\nalso helps to mitigate another complication which may arise\npreferentially at high redshift. The galaxies accessible to\ndetailed spectroscopic studies at redshifts z = 1 \u2212 3 support very high rates of star formation, one to two orders of\nmagnitude higher than those seen in the local universe (e.g.\nSteidel et al. 2003, 2004). There are also mounting indications that, even at these early epochs, such galaxies have\nalready reached near-solar metallicities (e.g. Pettini 2004).\nWhen galactic chemical evolution proceeds at such a fast\npace, the production of primary nitrogen from intermediate and low mass stars can lag behind that of oxygen from\nType II supernovae, as found by Pettini et al. (2002b) in\nthe z = 2.7276 Lyman break galaxy MS1512-cB58 (see also\nMatteucci & Pipino 2002). How far (N/O) is 'out of equilibrium' depends on the metallicity, the star formation rate,\nand the yet poorly constrained timescale for the release of\nprimary nitrogen (e.g. Meynet & Pettini 2003). However,\neven in cases where N is over-deficient relative to O by factors of 2\u20133, as in MS1512-cB58, the slope of \u22120.32 in the\nrelation log (O/H) vs. O3N 2 limits the error in log (O/H)\n<\nto \u223c\n0.15 (given that ([N ii]/H\u03b1) varies linearly or slower\nwith the nitrogen abundance in this regime).\nFinally, it is encouraging that abundance calibrators\ndeveloped from measurements in individual extragalactic\nH ii regions seem to be fairly robust when applied to the\nintegrated light of galaxies (Kobulnicky, Kennicutt, &\nPizagno 1999; Moustakas & Kennicutt, in preparation).\nThus, we propose that, with the aid of the O3N 2 index, it\nshould be possible to measure the oxygen abundances of\nstar forming galaxies at z > 1 to better than a factor of two\nwith only a relatively modest investment in observing time.\nWe are grateful to Chris Akerman, Mike Irwin and\nSamantha Rix for help with the production of the figures,\nand to Mike Dopita, Lisa Kewley and Chuck Steidel for valuable comments.\n\nREFERENCES\nAllende-Prieto, C., Lambert, D.
