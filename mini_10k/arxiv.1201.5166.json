The Nice model\nsuggests that comets were expelled from the inner-Neptunian region (about 5\u201330 AU\nfrom the proto-Sun) to their actual present day reservoirs as a result of interactions with\nthe giant planets (Gomes et al. 2005; Tsiganis et al. 2005; Morbidelli et al. 2008). A later\nadaptation explored the possible capture of Oort Cloud comets from stars in the Sun's\nbirth cluster (Levison et al. 2010). Such models imply profound differences in the place\nof origin of pre-cometary materials, in their physical-chemical signatures, and in the\ncomposition of primitive icy planetesimals. Once formed and ejected to quiescent\nregions (KB, OC), the native composition of cometary nuclei is believed to remain\nisolated from external catalysts. If so, the nature of the volatile fraction in comet nuclei\ncarries fundamental clues to these processes.\nThe molecular composition and taxonomy of comets provide essential information\nthat might help us trace the primordial conditions of the Solar System. The large\ndiversity of molecular abundances measured in comets, however, presents major\nconstraints that must be satisfied when classifying these objects and placing them in the\ncontext of suitable formation scenarios.\nComet 10P/Tempel 2 (hereafter 10P) was discovered by Ernst Wilhelm\nLiebrecht Tempel in 1873. Since then, 10P has been characterized by several studies,\nespecially during the 1988 apparition (e.g., A'Hearn et al. 1989; Jewitt and Luu 1989;\nSekanina 1991; Sykes et al. 1998; Biver et al. 2002; Knight et al. 2011, and references\ntherein). Light curve studies of 10P suggest a spheroidal nucleus of 16.3 \u00d7 8.6 \u00d7 8.6\nkm3 with a rotation period of 8.9 hr. Its orbit is inclined to the ecliptic by 12.0\u00b0, the\nJupiter Tisserand parameter with respect to Jupiter is 2.963, and the period is 5.37\nyears. Together these classify 10P as an ecliptic comet of the Jupiter dynamical\n\t\n  \n\n3\t\n  \n\n\ffamily.\nIn this study, we report gas production rates, chemical composition, and spatial\nproperties of primary volatiles in Jupiter family comet (JFC) 10P/Tempel 2. We\ncompare water production rates measured during its 2010 and 1988 apparitions, and\ncompare the chemical composition revealed herein with that of other JFCs\ncharacterized at infrared (IR) wavelengths. Ultimately, we attempt to distinguish\npossible formation scenarios for 10P, using cosmogonic parameters inferred from our\nobservational results.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and data analysis\nWe conducted astronomical observations of comet 10P using NIRSPEC at the 10-\n\nmeter W. M. Keck Observatory (Keck II) atop Mauna Kea, Hawaii, on UT 2010 Jul 26\nand Sep 18. NIRSPEC is a cross-dispersed echelle grating spectrometer which features\na 1024 \u00d7 1024 InSb array detector with pixels that sample 0.144\u2032\u2032 (spectral) \u00d7 0.198\u2032\u2032\n(spatial) extent (McLean et al. 1998). The cross-dispersed capability allows NIRSPEC to\nsample a wide range of spectral orders with relatively high spectral resolving power\n(\u03bb/\u2206\u03bb \u223c 25,000), enabling the simultaneous detection of ro-vibrational transitions of\nmultiple gases and their spatial distributions along the slit. In 10P we quantified\nrotational temperatures for water and HCN, production rates for six gases, and possible\ncosmogonic parameters such as the abundance ratio (OPR) of nuclear spin species\n(ortho, para) of water (and the equivalent spin temperature, Tspin) and the mixing ratios\nof primary (parent) volatiles.\nWe used a 0.432\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 24\u2032\u2032 slit configuration for observations of comet 10P. This\narrangement allowed simultaneous sampling of six spectral orders within the L band\n(2.8\u20134.1 \u03bcm), in each order encompassing about 40 cm-1. In July 2010, instrument\nsetting KL1 sampled emission lines of H2O, OH\u2217, C2H6, and CH3OH while setting KL2\nsampled H2O, OH\u2217, HCN, H2CO, C2H2, and NH3. We used only the KL2 setting for the\nSeptember observations (see Table 1). Weather conditions were good on both dates.\nSeeing was 0.9\u2032\u2032 (0.7\u2032\u2032) FWHM and the airmass was 1.15 (1.5) on 2010 July 26\n(September 18). The comet was observed using a four-step sequence ABBA with an\n\t\n  \n\n4\t\n  \n\n\fintegration time of 60 sec/step, nodding the telescope by 12\u2032\u2032 between the A and B\npositions (i.e., a single ABBA sequence required 4 min integration time for completion).\nSince the comet was a relatively small object, it was contained entirely within the slit\nlength (24\u2032\u2032, or \u223c120 pixels). The operation (A1-B1-B2+A2) provided cancellation (to\nsecond order, in a Taylor series expansion about the mean air mass) of thermal\nbackground emission and of \"sky\" line emission from the Earth's atmosphere.\nWe followed our standard methodology for data reduction and analysis of the\nindividual echelle orders (e.g., see Bonev 2005 for details). Initial data processing\nincluded the removal of high dark current pixels and cosmic-ray hits, flat-fielding, spatial\nand spectral rectification, and spatial registration. After combining the A and B beams\nfrom the difference frames, we extracted a spectrum from the sum of 9 spatial rows\n(1.78\u2032\u2032) centered on the nucleus (this also contributes to removing residual background,\nsee Bonev 2005 Appendix 2). The extracted spectrum contains emission lines of\ncometary gases and continuum radiation associated with cometary dust grains. We\nisolated the emission lines by subtracting a transmittance function synthesized for the\nterrestrial atmosphere (normalized to the cometary continuum) from the combined\nspectrum. We synthesized the spectral transmittance by using a multiple layer\natmosphere and a radiative transfer model (LBLRTM) that accessed the HITRAN-2008\nmolecular database enhanced with our custom updated line parameters and fluorescence\nmodels (e.g., Villanueva et al. 2011a). Flux calibration was achieved through\nobservations of the IR standard stars BS0015 and BS1040 with a 0.720\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 24\u2032\u2032 slit\nconfiguration.\nOn 2010 July 26, we detected several lines of H2O and OH\u2217 (prompt emission) in\nthe combined KL1 and KL2 settings (see Fig. 1), along with the presence of minor\nvolatiles. Figure 2 shows spectral lines of ethane (C2H6) and methanol (CH3OH) using\nthe KL1 setting alone. In addition, the KL2 setting provided detections of hydrogen\ncyanide (HCN) and ammonia (NH3), as well as upper limits for formaldehyde (H2CO)\nand acetylene (C2H2). Even though the UT 2010 September observations did not show\nclear spectral, these data allowed us to obtain a sensitive upper limit for water production\nin 10P.\n\n\t\n  \n\n5\t\n  \n\n\f3.\n\nResults\nAfter applying fluorescence models to these spectra, we retrieved consistent\n\nrotational temperatures (Section 3.1) and production rates (Section 3.2). In particular,\nTable 2 gives a summary of the observed volatiles, as well as their total flux,\nfluorescence efficiencies (or g-factors), rotational temperatures, production rates, and\nrelative abundance (relative to water). Section 3.3 presents a determination of the\northo-to-para ratio and spin temperature in water. Spatial profiles for H2O, C2H6,\nCH3OH, HCN and the continuum are discussed in Section 3.4.\n3.1.\n\nRotational temperature\nBecause the rotational populations are not completely sampled, an accurate\n\nmeasure of the rotational temperature (Trot) is needed to estimate the complete\npopulation of a particular species from the lines measured, i.e., an accurate value for\nTrot is essential for retrieving accurate production rates in the coma. We obtain Trot by\ncorrelation and excitation analyses using precise quantum band models. For water,\nwe used ortho-water lines extracted from KL1 and KL2 settings (Figs. 1 and 3). We\ncompared the extracted line intensities with those predicted by an advanced H2O\nfluorescence model, synthesized at intervals of 1 K. The H2O model employs a\ncombination of existing spectral databases to compute detailed (non-resonance)\nfluorescence of many (hot-band) water transitions (Villanueva et al. 2012).\nThe resulting H2O rotational temperature, Trot (35 \u00b1 3 K), applies to our nucleuscentered aperture of 3 by 9 pixels (equivalent to 0.43\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 1.78\u2032\u2032, or 266 \u00d7 800 km on\nJuly 26). The value derived for HCN (Trot = 36 +13-9 K), based on ten emission lines (see\nFig. 3 and Table 2), is consistent with the rotational temperature obtained for H2O.\n3.2.\n\nProduction rates and molecular abundances\nAn apparent production rate is determined from the flux of each ro-vibrational\n\ntransition detected within our sampled aperture, Fline [W m-2]. Our methodology\nconsiders the molecular lifetime, \u03c4 [s], and the fraction of total molecular content in the\ncoma sampled by each pixel, f(x). Assuming a constant outflow velocity (0.8 Rh-0.5 km\n\n\t\n  \n\n6\t\n  \n\n\fs-1) and uniform decay rate in the coma, the product of \u03c4 and f(x) is independent of\nmolecular lifetime. Fluorescence efficiencies are based on quantum-mechanical models\nfor each molecule (see Villanueva et al. 2011b, and reference therein). Current\nastrometric parameters are accounted for at the time of our observations, i.e., geocentric\ndistance (\u2206), the terrestrial transmittance (Ti ), and the proper fluorescence efficiency\n(the so-called \"g-factor\", gi) at the appropriate rotational temperature and heliocentric\ndistance, Rh. The nucleus-centered production rate derived from the individual line is\ngiven by:\n\nIn the process of obtaining production rates, a matrix of individual 0.144\u2032\u2032 by\n0.198\u2032\u2032 extracts is used to calculate the net flux contribution within the sampled\naperture (3 \u00d7 9 pixels). Individual line fluxes (Fline) are affected by \"seeing\" effects\n(blurring and twinkling due to the Earth's atmosphere) and by slight drifts of the comet\nduring individual exposures of the ABBA sequences (see DiSanti et al. 2006, and\nreferences therein). So the nucleus-centered flux, smeared out by these phenomena,\nunderestimates the real production rates observed. This issue, however, is compensated\nby a correction or growth factor (see Fig. 4), which essentially describes the ratio of\nterminal to nucleus-centered production rates (where terminal refers to off-nucleus\nextracts along the slit spatial direction). This growth factor is applied to retrieved\nnucleus-centered rates, resulting in total production rates. Determination of terminal\nproduction rates and correction for slit-losses using the standard Q-curve analysis\nincorporates mean emission intensities from diametrically opposed positions along the\nslit (e.g., DiSanti et al. 2001). This averages out potential asymmetries in the coma and\nso producing more representative overall production rates, as was demonstrated by Xie\nand Mumma (1996).\nThe water production rate was obtained from orders 26 and 27 in the KL1 setting\nand from order 26 in the KL2 setting, using twenty-five H2O emission lines (ortho and\n\n\t\n  \n\n7\t\n  \n\n\fpara species), acquired during a total integration time of 60 min. (Since each setting\ngives a similar water production rate, we safely assume that inter-setting flux calibration\n28\n\nis not an issue.) The total water production rate was equal to (1.90 \u00b1 0.12) \u00d7 10\n1\n\nmolecules s on UT 2010 July 26. In addition to water line emissions (Fig. 1), our\n\u2212\n\nobservations revealed the presence of trace gases (Fig. 2): we detected and quantified\nHCN, C2H6, CH3OH, and NH3, and we set (3\u03c3) upper limits for C2H2, and H2CO.\nProduction rates of all species and abundances relative to water are displayed in Table 2.\nOn UT 2010 September 18 we observed 10P for a total of 28 min integration time\nusing the KL2 setting. Analysis of this dataset revealed a strong continuum but no\napparent spectral emission lines. Since the rotational temperature is poorly constrained\nby our observations, we adopted 30 K (assuming Trot varies as ~ Rh-1.5 heliocentric\ndependence, Biver et al. 1999) on September 18. An upper limit (3\u03c3) for the global water\nproduction rate water was then estimated (2.86 \u00d7 1027 molecules s-1, a terminal value).\nWe assumed a representative growth factor to be 1.6, which is consistent with previous\nobservations with NIRSPEC.\nDuring the 1988 apparition, the reported (post-perihelion) water production rates at\nRh = 1.44 AU were ~2 \u00d7 1028 molecules s-1, derived from visual magnitudes reported in\nIAU Circulars, and ~2.9 \u00d7 1028 molecules s-1, based on UV observations with the\nInternational Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) satellite (see Roettger et al. 1991, and references\ntherein). Likewise, estimates at Rh = 1.62 AU resulted in Q(H2O) ~ 1.5 \u00d7 1028 molecules\ns-1 (from IAU Circulars) and (1\u20132) \u00d7 1028 molecules s-1 (IUE satellite). Our upper limit in\nSeptember 2010 is lower than those values measured in 1988. Such strong decrease,\nhowever, is supported by contemporary observations in the visual1. Based on a sample of\n37 comets, Jorda et al. (2008) derived an empirical relation between Q(H2O) and visual\nmagnitude {log Q(H2O) = 30.675 - 0.2453 (mv \u2013 5 log \u0394)}. Applied to 10P, this relation\nimplies a decrease in Q(H2O) by a factor of at least 7 between July 26 and September 18,\nconsistent with our measurements. Similarly, recent estimates of production rates from\nHST (Hubble Space Telescope) observations determined a (pre-perihelion) water\n\t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n  \n1\t\n  http://www.aerith.net/comet/catalog/0010P/2010.html. Based on these data, we adopted a visual magnitude m ~\nv\n0.5 (~13.5 \u00b1 0.5) on UT 2010 Jul 26 (on Sept 18) in our calculations. \t\n  \n\t\n  \n\n8\t\n  \n\n9\u00b1\n\n\fproduction of 1.8 \u00d7 1027 molecules s-1 on 1999 June 23 (at Rh = 1.67 AU and \u0394 = 0.68\nAU; Lamy et al., 2009), also consistent with our upper limit at Rh = 1.62 AU postperihelion.\n3.3.\n\nOPR and nuclear spin temperature of H2O\nMolecules containing symmetrically located hydrogen atoms in their molecular\n\nstructure, e.g., H2O, H2CO, are quantized by the total nuclear spin angular momentum,\nwhich depends the relative orientation of the proton spins. Basically, these species\nindicate the molecular spin of the hydrogen atoms, being parallel or anti-parallel,\nrespectively. The abundance of these (ortho and para spin) species is contingent upon\nthe temperature when the molecule was last equilibrated (Bockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al.\n2004), and these spin properties are not effectively modified by inelastic collisions or\nradiative processes in the coma (Mumma et al. 1987; Kawakita and Kobayashi 2009,\nand references therein). Following these molecular properties, Crovisier (1984);\nMumma et al. (1987) suggested that the OPR should serve as an indicator of the\nthermal conditions when cometary ices agglomerated, and thus should provide\nperspectives on the formation region(s) within the protoplanetary disk.\nTo obtain the OPR in water, we used (ten) ortho-water and (four) para-water\nemission lines from orders 26 and 27 in the KL1 setting. Our improved quantum band\nmodel for water provided a satisfactory fit to all lines, and resulted in an OPR = 3.01 \u00b1\n0.18, corresponding to (1\u03c3) Tspin > 38 K. This result is consistent with complementary\ncalculations using ortho and para H2O lines from orders 26 and 27 in the KL1 setting\nand order 26 in the KL2 setting (Fig. 1). Previous studies have reported spin\ntemperatures in water (Crovisier et al. 2006) and ammonia (Kawakita et al. 2004) to be\nclustered near 30 K in several comets, although measurements in some comets are\nconsistent with OPR in statistical equilibrium (OPR = 3.0, Tspin > 50 K) (e.g., Dello\nRusso et al. 2008; Bonev et al. 2007). For a recent review of spin temperatures in\nwater, ammonia, and methane, see Mumma and Charnley (2011).\n3.4.\n\nSpatial profiles\nIn mid-July, the projected comet-Sun radius vector was oriented at position angle\n\n\t\n  \n\n9\t\n  \n\n\f(P.A.) 72.5\u00b0(measured CCW from North) and optical images revealed a prominent jet in\nCN at P.A. ~20\u00b0 (Schwieterman et al. 2010). The CN jet did not vary with rotational\nphase or in position throughout June and July (Knight and Schleicher 2010).\nOn UT 2010 July 26, we oriented the slit along the jet (i.e., 20\u00b0 CCW from North)\nin order to sample the gas activity, and to investigate spatial profiles of primary volatiles\nas revealed in the IR. Compared with dust, all four volatiles are much more extended in\nthe jet direction (negative pixels along the slit, Fig. 5). C2H6, H2O and CH3OH show\nsimilar outgassing patterns, suggesting a common mechanism of release. Hydrogen\ncyanide is also enhanced in the jet direction, but its intensity peaks closer to the nucleus\nand the intensity distribution is flatter there, compared with the other gases. The SunComet-Earth (i.e., phase) angle of 39.9\u00b0 suggests that the strong enhancement seen in\nthese profiles is likely associated with local insolation on the nucleus.\nThe maxima in the spatial intensity profiles for C2H6, H2O and CH3OH are\ndisplaced sunward from the continuum peak by about 200 km (to the left in our plot). In\nthe anti-jet direction, these four volatiles follow a distribution similar to the dust\ncontinuum, and no strong excursions are observed. At Rh = 1.5 AU in 1988, Spinrad\n(1991) found similar displacements between the continuum and some radicals (NH2, C2,\nand [O I]) in the sunward direction. (We note that the O I emission is prompt emission\nfollowing dissociation of the H2O parent, and thus the O I profile tracks that of the\nprimary volatile.) If we take the continuum peak to indicate the nucleus position, this\nbehavior might be explained by the existence of a distributed source mechanism, such as\nrelease of gases from icy grains that are removed from the nucleus before subliming\ncompletely.\nWe tentatively interpret the release of icy grains by a simple approximation,\nalthough a full analysis requires a comprehensive model of grain production. A study by\nBeer et al. (2006), which accounts for radiative heating, radiative cooling, and\nevaporative cooling to estimate the energy balance on grains in cometary comae,\nconfirmed that sublimation rates in ice grains depend on grain size, composition, and\ndistance from the Sun. The estimated lifetime of 1 \u03bcm (dirty) ice grains at Rh = 1.44 AU\nis lgrain ~ 400 s. Biver et al. 1999 estimate the outflow gas velocity to be vgas = 0.9 Rh-0.4\n\t\n  \n\n10\t\n  \n\n\fkm s-1 (i.e. 0.78 km s-1 at Rh = 1.44 AU) at post perihelion distances. If the terminal\nvelocity of the grain is half that of the gas, the total sublimation of these icy grains\nwould occur by nucleocentric distances (dsublimation = vgrain * lgrain) of ~150 km. For grains\nof 1-cm size, the estimated lifetime is 2 \u00d7 105 s, and with a terminal velocity of 1 m s-1\ntheir total sublimation would occur by a nucleocentric distance of ~200 km. The\nsublimation of massive icy clumps, on the other hand, would impart only very small\ncenter-of-mass motion to gases sublimed from them, and the spatial profiles of such\ngases would peak at the same apparent position as the nucleus and be more uniformly\ndistributed about it (such as in 103P/Hartley 2, see Mumma et al. 2011, and in C/2007\nW1 (Boattini), see Villanueva et al. 2011b). A peak displacement of ~200 km from the\nnucleus' center, however, suggests that sublimation was somewhat delayed compared\nwith direct (and smooth) release at the nucleus. This favors the idea of small (~micron\nsize) particles with high outflow velocity instead of large clumps. More detailed\nmodeling is beyond the scope of this paper.\nThe continuum profile decreased sharply in both directions (similar to the PSF of\nthe flux standard star), suggestive of a point-like source. The fairly symmetric and much\nsharper infrared continuum could be explained by either a collimated coma (cf. Hewitt\nand Luu 1989), a dust-free or dust-poor coma (cf. A'Hearn et al. 1989; Roettger et al.\n1990; Lamy et al. 2009), or our slit P.A. not being positioned along the dust vent\n(Schwieterman et al. 2010 found an offset between the CN jet and dust jet in their 1999\nand 2010 optical observations). The principal contribution is likely reflected from and/or\nemitted by the nucleus, with some contribution possible from large refractory grains\n(e.g. Kelley et al., 2004).\nOn July 26, the estimated flux density of the continuum was (1.3 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10-15 W\nm-2 \u03bcm-1 in the L-band (3.45 \u03bcm). Using a standard (non-spherical) thermal model and a\nchi-square fit, the observed flux density is well described by reflected sunlight and\nthermal emission from the nucleus at a nucleus temperature of 290 \u00b1 10 K (assuming an\neffective radius of 4.8 km, an albedo of 0.07, and an emissivity of 0.9; further discussion\nof the various contributions in the 2.8\u20133.7 \u03bcm region and of the model used is deferred\nto a future publication). At Rh = 1.72 AU, A'Hearn et al. (1989) estimated a nucleus\n\n\t\n  \n\n11\t\n  \n\n\ftemperature of 270 K. These temperatures exceed those of a blackbody at these\nheliocentric distances, suggesting some contribution from dust. We note, however, that\nsurface temperatures larger than 300 K have been estimated on several comets (at\nsimilar Rh) by in-situ measurements (e.g., Soderblom et al. 2004; Groussin et al. 2007).\nOn 1989 October 4.67 (Rh = 1.39 AU, post perihelion), Tokunaga et al. 1989 measured\na nucleus flux of 0.82 \u00d7 10-15 W m-2 \u03bcm-1 and dust flux of 5.12 \u00d7 10-15 W m-2 \u03bcm-1 in\n\n+\n\nthe K-band (2.19 \u03bcm). Based on these estimates, our measured flux seems to be\nconsistent with a contribution mostly from the nucleus.\nThe spatial profiles for primary volatiles are strongly enhanced in the direction of a\njet observed at optical wavelengths in 2010 mid-July (M. Knight 2011, private\ncommunication). A comparison of the two data sets will help to address the possible role\nof HCN as progenitor for the CN radical (e.g., Paganini et al. 2010).\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion\nJupiter Family comets (JFCs) have experienced multiple apparitions since the first\n\ndirect detections of primary volatiles (in 1985) and the advent of suitably sensitive\nastronomical facilities (1990\u20132000). Such warming is a common occurrence for many\ncomets in short period orbits, and for them it is not yet certain whether the observed\nabundances of native species reflect the formation heritage of cometary ices or instead\nare a consequence of thermo-chemical evolution during multiple perihelion passages.\n(Only a dozen JFCs have been characterized even once in primary volatiles at infrared\nwavelengths, and even fewer on multiple occasions.) Several studies, however, strongly\nfavor the idea that their observed volatile compositions might indeed preserve intrinsic\ncharacteristics from the epoch of formation:\n\u2022\n\nProduction rates can vary greatly on time scales from hours (generally\nassociated with nucleus rotation) to months (associated with orbital motion),\nbut the relative abundance ratios and physical properties in released\nvolatiles may remain unchanged. The production rates of primary volatiles\nin JFC 103P/Hartley-2 varied by a factor of two with nucleus rotation, but\ntheir abundance ratios remained constant to a small degree of uncertainty\n\n\t\n  \n\n12\t\n  \n\n\fboth day-by-day and over a span of three months during the 2010 apparition\n(Mumma et al. 2011; Dello Russo et al. 2011). Again, in 1P/Halley (a nearly\nisotropic comet of OC origin), the relaxed nuclear spin temperature was\nunchanged over a span of three months (December 1985 \u2013 March 1986)\neven though the comet experienced massive surface wasting during that\ntime and was characterized by multiple active regions (Mumma et al. 1993;\nBockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al. 2004).\n\u2022\n\nFragments B and C of the split JFC 73P/SW3 showed quite different\nproduction rates, but essentially identical chemical properties, including\nsevere depletion in organic volatiles (Villanueva et al. 2006; Dello Russo\net al. 2007; Kobayashi et al. 2007; Paganini et al. 2010). Since fragment\nB was undergoing complete disintegration, the comparison demonstrated\nthat the two fragments shared a common chemical composition and\nhistory, independent of any earlier surface processing.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe chemistry of JFC 21P/Giacobini-Zinner remained unchanged on\nsuccessive apparitions (1998 and 2005), showing that the composition of\nits active layers did not vary with depth in the nucleus despite significant\nsurface wasting (Weaver et al. 1999; Mumma et al. 2000; DiSanti et al.\n2012, in prep.).\n\n\u2022\n\nIn particular, outburst events might offer a genuine opportunity to examine\nrelatively pristine constituents from the bulk material released from the\ninner nucleus, where such material had little (if any) chance of\nexperiencing chemical processing by thermal and radiative effects during\nthe comet's lifetime. The enriched organics and very low spin temperature\nfound for H2O in the outbursting OC comet C/2001 A2 (LINEAR) may be\nespecially significant. By contrast, the disintegrating JFC\n73P/Schwassman-Wachmann 3 showed depleted organics and nuclear spin\nratios consistent with statistical equilibrium, for H2O and NH2 (i.e., NH3).\n\nThe diverse composition of organics in comets has led IR observers to suggest a\n\n\t\n  \n\n13\t\n  \n\n\fchemical taxonomy based on organic content and composition relative to water\nvapor, including organics-enriched, -normal and -depleted populations (Mumma et al.\n2003). Infrared observations to date have suggested that most JFCs are relatively\ndepleted in organic volatiles with respect to water vapor, although this is based on a\nvery small number of comets. In comet 10P, the abundance ratios (relative to water)\nfor CH3OH and NH3 are consistent with organics-normal comets, C2H6 and HCN are\nsignificantly depleted, and C2H2 and H2CO are severely depleted. Other exceptions to\nthe trend of JFCs being \"organics-depleted\" have been found-material excavated\nfrom the nucleus of 9P/Tempel 1 by Deep Impact was found to be normal in the ratio\nC2H6/H2O (Mumma et al. 2005, DiSanti et al. 2007); material ejected from\n17P/Holmes during a massive outburst in 2007 was enriched in organics (Dello\nRusso et al. 2007); and 103P/Hartley-2 had nearly-normal organic abundances\n(A'Hearn et al. 2011; Mumma et al. 2011; Dello Russo et al. 2011). This diversity\nstrengthens the view that comets might not have a common heritage, and thus it\nsupports current dynamical evolution models that suggest accretion occurred in\ndifferent regions of the proto-solar nebula (see Duncan 2008, and references therein).\nA taxonomy based on organic volatiles in the radio demonstrated no clear trends\namong JFCs and Oort Cloud comets (Crovisier et al. 2009). However, compositional\ncomparisons based on radio observations could be biased owing to technical\nconsiderations (see the review by Mumma and Charnley 2011). Figure 6 (and Table\n3) displays a comparison of mixing ratios for primary volatiles in JFCs from IR\nobservations. Based on the current sample of eight JFCs, we observe a similar trend\nin composition (though methanol displays strong deviations), suggesting a common\nplace of formation (with a few exceptions as mentioned above). Needless to say, a\nlarger sample will reinforce current statistics and shed further light on this discussion.\nWe note that, although the current database of JFCs at infrared wavelengths totals\nfewer than a dozen comets, the recent advent of new state-of-the-art IR facilities has\npermitted its dramatic expansion since 1999.\nWhen connected with the chemical composition of primary volatiles, abundance\nratios of nuclear spin species (i.e., ortho-para ratios) and spin temperatures may aid in\nthe understanding of cometary origins. Questions have been raised whether or not values\n\n\t\n  \n\n14\t\n  \n\n\ffor these result from alteration in the cometary nucleus (e.g. Kawakita et al. 2004), or\nmight result from the interaction of gases with dust grains. Such questions are as yet\nunresolved, largely because laboratory measurements are difficult and lacking (Crovisier\n2007; Bonev et al. 2007; Kawakita and Kobayashi 2009, and references therein, however\nsee Mumma et al. 1987, and Mumma and Charnley 2011). External factors are believed\nto modify these physical properties in the meter-thick outer layer of the cometary\nnucleus, for example solar irradiation of JFCs during multiple perihelion passages and\ncosmic-ray irradiation of Oort Cloud comets (Mumma et al. 1988). If these catalysts\nwere indeed negligible, the OPR analysis should provide hints to the initial\ncharacteristics and formation conditions of cometary volatiles. The relatively low\nabundance of organics and an OPR consistent with statistical equilibrium in comet 10P\nsuggest that accretion of its cometary ices occurred in the proto-planetary disk, closer to\nthe Sun, where some degree of thermal processing occurred.\nAmong the organic compounds measured, we find a relatively high abundance of\nethane and methanol with respect to acetylene and formaldehyde, respectively. The\nratio C2H6/(C2H2 + C2H6) > 0.86 observed in comet 10P evokes the idea of formation\nvia hydrogenation processes (Mumma et al. 1996). Similarly, an indirect evaluation of\nCO-ice hydrogenation can be tested through a high abundance of CH3OH with respect\nto H2CO, following the CO \u2192 H2CO \u2192 CH3OH chemical reaction (Watanabe et al.\n2003; Fuchs et al. 2009). (Note that with single aperture measurements, we quantify\nH2CO released as a monomer but we cannot test the abundance of polymeric\nformaldehyde. Thus, our ratio CH3OH/(H2CO + CH3OH) provides only an upper bound\n(< 95%) to the hydrogenation efficiency of formaldehyde in pre-cometary ice.)\nHydrogenation of simple hydrocarbons (e.g. C2H2, C2H4) is a likely process at low\ntemperatures (Hiraoka et al. 2000). Hence, the legacy of pre-cometary ices has been\nlinked to interstellar chemistry because of the intrinsic low temperature in the ISM,\nwherein adsorbed H-atoms have higher sticking probability and less chance for\nrecombination reactions (H + H \u2192 H2) on the grain.\nHydrogenation, which takes place at low temperatures (e.g., < 20 K), is not\ncompatible with spin temperatures above 38 K (from our OPR estimate), because the\nlatter indicates formation in a warm environment. If these two measurements reveal the\n\t\n  \n\n15\t\n  \n\n\f\"true\" (and undisputed) history of cometary nuclei during formation, then either they\noccurred at different epochs, or alternatively the measured cometary ethane and\nmethanol might have been produced by sources other than hydrogenation. Indeed,\nubiquitous presence of methanol and methane has been found in cold regions of Young\nStellar Objects (Boogert et al. 2008; Boogert et al. 2011, and references therein). These\nfindings suggest other possible sources for C2H6 and CH3OH in pre-cometary ices,\nwhere irradiated methane ice might serve as a source of ethane by the exothermic\nreaction of two methyl radicals (Hudson & Moore 1997; Bennett et al. 2006).\n\n5.\n\nConclusions\nWe observed the Jupiter Family Comet 10P/Tempel 2 on UT 2010 July 26 and\n\nSeptember 18, using high-dispersion infrared spectroscopy. On July 26, we detected\nwater (production rate (1.90 \u00b1 0.12) \u00d7 1028 molecules s-1; rotational temperature 35 \u00b1 3\nK), and multiple trace gases. The rotational temperature for HCN (36+13-9 K) was\nconsistent with that found for H2O. We did not detect molecular emission features in\nSeptember, but we did obtain a sensitive upper limit for water production (2.86 \u00d7 1027\nmolecules s-1, assuming Trot = 30 K).\nSpatial profiles in comet 10P revealed significant release of major volatiles in a\ndirection (P.A. 20o) coincident with a jet-like feature observed by optical observers in\n2010 mid-July. The particular off-centered profiles displayed by these volatiles\nsuggested the possible existence of a distributed source, such as the release of icy grains\nthat subsequently sublimed in the coma.\nProvided its composition revealed pristine conditions during the perihelion passage in\n2010, our measured volatile composition in comet 10P showed evidence of formation in a\n\"warm\" environment (a relative low organic composition and OPR consistent with\nstatistical equilibrium). However, hydrogenation of certain volatiles, which suggests\nprocessing in a \"colder\" region, could have occurred at an earlier stage. This issue is a\nmajor focus of astrochemical models predicting the processing history of volatiles from\ntheir (suggested) varied formation environments ranging from proto-solar clouds to the\nmid-plane of subsequently evolved proto-planetary disks where comets later formed.\n\n\t\n  \n\n16\t\n  \n\n\fAcknowledgments.\nKeck telescope time was granted by the University of Hawaii and NOAO (through the\nTelescope System Instrumentation Program funded by NSF).

The reported error in production rate includes the line-by-line scatter in measured column densities, along with\nphoton noise, systematic uncertainty in the removal of the cometary continuum, and (minor) uncertainty in rotational\ntemperature.\nf. We tabulate the retrieved Trot and confidence limits; however, all measured temperatures are\nconsistent with 35 K. For HCN and C2H6, the derived Q's are only weakly sensitive to Trot, so we\nadopted 35 K for all species when calculating the NC production rates.\ng. Fink (2009) estimated NH2/H2O equal to 0.19% on 1988 Oct 9 (Rh = 1.41 AU, \u0394 = 1.07 AU). If we\napply fluorescence efficiencies from Kawakita and Watanabe (2002) to Fink's estimates, the NH2\nabundance increases to ~0.4%, which is a factor of 2 lower than that required to fulfill NH3 as the main\nsource for NH2 (photodissociation of ammonia leads to direct formation of NH2, with 95% efficiency).\n\n\t\n  \n\n19\t\n  \n\n\fTable 3.
