Bagger, Lambert, and\nGustavsson1)\u20135) proposed an N = 8 Chern-Simons theory as a model for multiple M2branes. This model (BLG model) is based on an interesting mathematical structure,\nso-called 3-algebra. The consistency condition (the fundamental identity) associated\nwith the 3-algebra is very restrictive, and there is only one example of superconformal\ntheory based on BLG model, which describes two M2-branes in certain orbifolds.6), 7)\nAfter this proposal, many works about superconformal Chern-Simons theories\nappeared. In 8), a new class of Chern-Simons matter systems which possess N = 4\nsupersymmetry is constructed. It is generalized in 9) by introducing new matter\nmultiplets (twisted hyper multiplets).\nA theory describing multiple M2-branes in the eleven-dimensional flat spacetime\nwas first proposed by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis, and Maldacena.10) Their model\n(ABJM model) is a U (N )\u00d7U (N ) Charn-Simons theory at level (k, \u2212k), and possesses\nN = 6 supersymmetry. They show that the model describes multiple M2-branes in\nthe orbifold C4 /Zk . If we take k = 1, this space becomes C4 , and the supersymmetry\nis expected to be enhanced to N = 8 in some non-trivial way. See also 11)\u201313) for\nN \u2265 4 Chern-Simons theories.\nWe can realize ABJM model by using a type IIB brane configuration consisting\nof D3-branes, one NS5-brane and one (k, 1)-fivebrane.10) This is generalized by\n\u2217)\n\u2217\u2217)\n\nE-mail: imamura@hep-th.phys.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp\nE-mail: yokoyama@hep-th.phys.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp\n\ntypeset using P T P TEX.cls hVer.0.9i\n\n\f2\n\nY. Imamura and S. Yokoyama\n\nincreasing the number of fivebranes to quiver Chern-Simons theories with circular\nquiver diagrams.14) If we introduce only two kinds of fivebranes with appropriate\ndirections, the Chern-Simons theory possesses N = 4 supersymmetry.15) In this\ncase, the corresponding geometry is a certain orbifold of C4 .14) See also 16), 17) for\norbifolds of ABJM model. If we introduce fivebranes with three or more different\ncharges, the number of supersymmetry is at most N = 3, and we have in general\ncurved hyper-K\u00e4hler geometries.18)\nAll these theories are conformal and have gravity duals.19) The purpose of this\npaper is to investigate some aspects about the gravity duals of N = 4 Chern-Simons\ntheories.\nOne is about fractional branes. Fractional branes in ABJM model are investigated in 20). It is suggested that in the gravity dual the fractional branes are realized\nas the torsion of the 3-form potential in the orbifolds S7 /Zk . In this paper we generalize this result to more general orbifold Mp,q,k = (S7 /(Zp \u2295 Zq ))/Zk associated with\nN = 4 Chern-Simons theories. We find that the homology H3 of this orbifold is pure\ntorsion again, and confirm that it agrees with the group of fractional brane charges\nin the type IIB brane configuration obtained by taking account of Hanany-Witten\neffect.\nWe also discuss baryonic operators and monopole operators. The gauge symmetry of the N = 4 Chern-Simons theory is\nG=(\n\nn\nY\n\nU (NI )I )/U (1)d = GSU \u00d7 GB ,\n\n(1.1)\n\nI=1\n\nwhere U (1)d is the diagonal U (1) subgroup which does not couple to any bi-fundamental\nfields, and GSU and GB are defined by\nGSU =\n\nn\nY\n\nI=1\n\nSU (NI )I ,\n\nGB = (\n\nn\nY\n\nU (1)I )/U (1)d .\n\n(1.2)\n\nI=1\n\nThe abelian part GB = U (1)n\u22121 is called baryonic symmetry. In the case of fourdimensional quiver gauge theories, the baryonic symmetry is often treated as a global\nsymmetry because in the infra-red limit it decouples from the system. In this paper,\nwe treat this part of gauge group in a similar way. Namely, when we define baryonic\noperators later, we require gauge invariance with respect only to the GSU part of the\ngauge group. Unlike the four-dimensional case, GB does not decouple even in the\ninfra-red limit, and thus baryonic operators we discuss in this paper are not gauge\ninvariant operators. In the case of ABJM model, the baryonic symmetry GB = U (1)\nis spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation values of the dual photon field,\nand we can define gauge invariant baryonic operators by multiplying appropriate\nfunctions of the dual photon field.21) This, however, does not work for n \u2265 3.\nDespite the gauge variance of baryonic operators, we identify them with M5branes wrapped on fivecycles in Mp,q,k , and confirm that the conformal dimension\nand multiplicity of the operators are reproduced on the gravity side in the same\nway as 22), in which the baryonic operators23) in the Klebanov-Witten theory24)\n\n\fN = 4 Chern-Simons theories and wrapped M-branes in their gravity duals\n\n3\n\nare investigated. This may seem contrary to the usual AdS/CFT dictionary, which\nrelates only gauge invariant operators to counterparts on the gravity side. We discuss\nthis point after mentioning the relation between monopole operators and wrapped\nM2-branes. In three-dimentional spacetime local operators in general carry magnetic\ncharges. A special class of monopole operators constructed with the dual photon\nfield carry the magnetic charge of the diagonal U (1) gauge group. We thus call\nthem diagonal monopole operators. When n \u2265 3 there is more variety of monopole\noperators in addition to diagonal ones. We propose that such non-diagonal monopole\noperators correspond to M2-branes wrapped on two-cycles in the internal space.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section we summarize\nfield contents, symmetries, and the moduli space of N = 4 Chern-Simons theories. In\nsection 3, we determine the group of fractional branes for k = 1 by using the type IIB\nsetup, and in Section 4 we reproduce it as the homology on the M-theory side. We\ndiscuss the correspondence between baryonic operators in Chern-Simons theories and\nM5-branes wrapped on five-cycles for k = 1 in Section 5. The analysis in Sections\n3, 4, and 5 are generalized to k \u2265 2 in Section 6. In Section 7 we again discuss\nrelation between baryonic operators and wrapped M5-branes. We show there that\nin the type IIB setup N open strings representing constituent bi-fundamental quarks\ncan be continuously deformed into a D3-brane disk, which is dual to a wrapped M5brane. In Section 8, we discuss the relation between fractional branes and torsion\nof the three-form potential in the M-theory background. In Section 9, we comment\non the relation between wrapped M2-branes and non-diagonal monopole operators,\nand explain why we do not impose GB gauge invariance on baryonic operators. We\nconclude the results in the last section.\n\u00a72.\n\nN = 4 Chern-Simons theories\n\nLet us consider an N = 4 supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory with gauge\ngroup (1.1). This theory includes the same number of vector multiplets and bifundamental hypermultiplets, and is represented by a circular quiver diagram. The\n\nFig. 1. A part of a circular quiver diagram of an N = 4 supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory is\nshown.\n\nsize of gauge groups NI may depend on vertices.\nA hypermultiplet HI contains two complex scalar fields and they belong to a\ndoublet of SU (2) R-symmetry. The R-symmetry Spin(4) = SU (2)2 of the N = 4\ntheory includes two SU (2) factors, and correspondingly there are two kinds of hypermultiplets, which are called untwisted and twisted hypermultiplets.9) We denote\ntwo SU (2) groups by SU (2)A and SU (2)B , and adopt the convention in which scalar\ncomponents of untwisted and twisted hypermultiplets are non-trivially transformed\n\n\f4\n\nY. Imamura and S. Yokoyama\n\nby SU (2)A and SU (2)B , respectively. We denote these scalar fields by h\u03b1I and\nh\u03b1\u0307I . (Undotted and dotted indices are ones for SU (2)A and SU (2)B , respectively.)\nFermions are transformed in the opposite way from the scalar fields. The theory also\npossesses two U (1) global symmetries as is shown in Table I.\nTable I. The global symmetries of the N = 4 Chern-Simons theory are shown. A certain combination of U (1)b and U (1)d acts on the hypermultiplets in the same way as a certain U (1) subgroup\nof gauge symmetry. This, however, does not act on the dual photon field, and, by this reason,\nis different from the gauge symmetry.\n\nSU (2)A\nSU (2)B\nU (1)b\nU (1)d\n\nuntwisted hypermultiplets\nh\u03b1\n\u03c8I\u03b1\u0307\nI\n2\n1\n1\n2\n+1\n+1\n+1\n+1\n\ntwisted hypermultiplets\nh\u03b1\u0307\n\u03c8I\u03b1\nI\n1\n2\n2\n1\n\u22121\n\u22121\n+1\n+1\n\nIn the type IIB brane system, which consists of D3-branes, NS5-branes, and\n(k, 1)-fivebranes, these hypermultiplets arises from the open strings stretched between two adjacent intervals of D3-branes. We use the same index I for fivebranes\nas hypermultiplets. The two kinds of hypermultiplets correspond to the two different charges of fivebranes. Let us define numbers sI associated with hypermultiplets\nwhich are 0 for untwisted hypermultiplets and 1 for twisted hypermultiplets. The\nRR charge of the fivebrane associated with the I-th hypermultiplet is ksI , and the\nboundary interaction of D3-branes ending on fivebranes induces the Chern-Simons\nterms25), 26)\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX kI Z\n2 3\nS=\ntr AI dAI + AI ,\n(2.1)\n4\u03c0\n3\nI\n\nwhere the level of the U (NI )I gauge group coupling to the hypermultiplets HI and\nHI+1 is given by\nkI = k(sI+1 \u2212 sI ).\n(2.2)\nIn the following, we refer to the integer k simply as the \"level\" of the theory.\nThe moduli space of this theory is analyzed in 14). We obtain the background\ngeometry of M2-branes as the Higgs branch moduli space of the theory with NI = 1.\nWhen k = 1, it is the product of two four-dimensional orbifolds.\nMp,q = C2 /Zp \u00d7 C2 /Zq ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere p and q are the numbers of untwisted and twisted hypermultiplets, respectively.\nFor later convenience, we introduce complex coordinates zi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) on which\nthe orbifold group acts by\n(z1 , z2 , z3 , z4 ) \u2192 (\u03c9pm z1 , \u03c9pm z2 , \u03c9qn z3 , \u03c9qn z4 ) m, n \u2208 Z,\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere \u03c9n = e2\u03c0i/n .

The R-symmetries SU (2)A and SU (2)B act on C2 /Zp and C2 /Zq , respectively.\nIn order to obtain the orbifold above, we should note that a certain subgroup\nof GB is spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value of the dual photon\nfield \u00e3, which is defined by\nn\nX\nkI AI .\n(2.8)\nd\u00e3 =\nI=1\n\nUnder the gauge symmetry AI \u2192 AI + d\u03bbI the dual photon field is transformed by\n(2.9)\n\n\u00e3 \u2192 \u00e3 + kI \u03bbI .\n\nThe dual photon field is periodic scalar field with period 2\u03c0,27) and the operator\nei\u00e3 carries U (1)I charge kI . The moduli space is parameterized by a set of mesonic\noperators. We define mesonic operators as G = GSU \u00d7 GB invariant operators. By\ndefinition, they are neutral with respect to the baryonic symmetry GB . All trace\noperators are mesonic operators. In addition to them, we can construct the following\nmesonic operators\nq\u0307\np\nY\nY\nk\ni\u00e3\n\u2212i\u00e3\n(h\u0227 )k ,\n(2.10)\n(ha ) , b\u0303 = e\nb=e\na=1\n\n\u0227=1\u0307\n\nwhen N = 1.\nWe suppress the R-symmetry indices in (2.10) . The right hand side of the\nfirst equation in (2.10) has pk SU (2)A indices, and we take symmetric part of these\nindices to define b. In terms of N = 2 language, the two scalar field h1I and h2I\nare chiral and anti-chiral fields, respectively, and thus b1***1 and (b2***2 )\u2020 are chiral\noperators. Due to the SU (2)A symmetry, other components also belong to certain\nshort multiplets. In the same way, b\u0303 has symmetric qk SU (2)B indices. When the\nsize of the gauge groups is N \u2265 2, we should replace the dual photon operators in\n(2.10) by appropriate monopole operators,21), 28), 29) which have color indices needed\nto make (2.10) gauge invariant.\nIf we put a large number of N M2-branes at the tip of the orbifold (2.6), and\ntake account of the back-reaction to the metric, we obtain the dual geometry of this\nsystem. It is AdS4 \u00d7 Mp,q,k , where Mp,q,k is the section of the orbifold (2.3) at\n|z1 |2 + |z2 |2 + |z3 |2 + |z4 |2 = 1.\n\n(2.11)\n\n\f6\n\nY. Imamura and S.

Fractional D3-branes\n\nAs we mentioned in the last section, the moduli space of an N = 4 ChernSimons theory depends only on the level k and the numbers p and q of two kinds of\nhypermultiplets. It does not depend on the order of the two kinds of hypermultiplets\nin the circular quiver diagrams.\nThis is quite similar to the situation in the elliptic models of four-dimensional\nN = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories. Such theories are generalizations of KlebanovWitten theory,24) and can be described by type IIA brane systems which consist of\nD4-branes wrapped along S1 and NS5-branes intersecting with the D4-branes. In\nthis brane configuration, NS5-branes are classified into two groups according to their\ndirections. Let us call these NS5-branes with different directions A-branes and Bbranes. On the D4-branes a four-dimensional gauge theory which is described by a\ncircular quiver diagram is realized. If the number of A- and B-branes are p and q,\nthe Coulomb branch moduli space of the gauge theory is the symmetric product of\na generalized conifold uv = xp y q ,30) which depends only on the numbers p and q,\nand is independent of the order of A- and B-branes along the S1 . The field theories\nsharing the same moduli space are related by Seiberg duality,31) and flow to the same\neffective theory in the infra-red limit. Such a relation between interchange of branes\nand Seiberg duality is first pointed out in 32).\nIt is natural to expect that this is also the case for the three-dimensional ChernSimons theories we are considering here. Such a brane exchange procedure is applied\nto three-dimensional Chern-Simons theories in 33), 34). Important difference of this\nduality and the four-dimensional one is that in the three-dimensional case the brane\nexchange process in general generates new D3-branes due to the Hanany-Witten\neffect.35) (Figure 2)\nThe purpose of this section is to classify theories which give the same moduli\nspace. We assume that two theories realized by brane systems related by a continuous\ndeformation are dual to each other and flow to the same infra-red fixed point. We\nidentify such theories, and the question considered here is how much variety of\ninequivalent theories exist for given p, q, and k. We study k = 1 case first, and\nlater discuss generalization to k \u2265 2.\nTo realize k = 1 theories, we use D3, NS5, and (1, 1) fivebranes. The set of\nthese three kinds of branes is equivalent to the set D3, NS5, and D5-branes up to a\n\n\fN = 4 Chern-Simons theories and wrapped M-branes in their gravity duals\n\n7\n\nFig. 2. An example of D3-brane creation process is shown. (a) is an initial configuration consisting\nof an NS5-brane and a (k, 1)-fivebrane. If (k, 1)-brane is moved on the other side of the NS5brane as shown in (b), k D3-branes are created.\n\ncertain SL(2, Z) duality transformation. Thus here we use the latter set of branes.\nThe directions of these branes are shown in Table II. The D3-branes are wrapped\nTable II. The type IIB brane configuration is shown.\nD3\nNS5\u00d7p\nD5\u00d7q\n\n0\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\n1\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\n2\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\n6\n\u25e6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\non the compactified direction x6 . The p NS5-branes and q D5-branes intersect with\nthe D3-brane worldvolume and divide the S1 into n = p + q intervals. We label the\nintersection points by I = 1, 2, . . . , n in order along S1 . We emphasize that when\nwe use I as a label of fivebranes, it represents the position of the fivebrane along\nS1 . In other words, I is the label of slots in which we can put fivebranes. We use\na, b = 1, . . . , p and \u0227, \u1e03 = 1\u0307, . . . , q\u0307 to label NS5-branes and D5-branes, respectively,\nand the location of each fivebrane is specified by giving one to one map (a, \u0227) \u2192 I.\nWe call the choice of this map \"frame\".\nWe denote the number of D3-branes in the interval between I-th and I + 1-th\nfivebranes by NI . These numbers give the size of each U (N ) factor in the gauge\ngroup in (1.1). Let us define mI as the number of D3-branes emanating from the\nI-th fivebrane. By definition NI and mI are related by\nmI = NI \u2212 NI\u22121 .\n\n(3.1)\n\nBecause mI are invariant under an overall shift NI \u2192 NI + c, (c \u2208 Z), we cannot\nuniquely determine NI from mI . This degree of freedom represents integral D3branes wrapping around the whole S1 . We here focus only on the fractional brane\ncharges and use mI to represent D3-brane distributions.\nThe numbers mI in general change when the order of fivebranes is changed by\ncontinuous deformations. By this reason, to specify brane configuration, we need\nnot only to give mI but also to specify the frame, the order of the fivebranes. In the\nfollowing we assume that we choose a particular frame.\nWith a fixed frame, a D3-brane distribution is specified by a vector\n(m1 , m2 , . . . , mp |m1\u0307 , m2\u0307 , . . . , mq\u0307 ).\n\n(3.2)\n\n\f8\n\nY. Imamura and S. Yokoyama\n\nWe call this vector \"charge vector.\" By definition, the components of a charge vector\nmust satisfy the constraint\np\nX\n\nma +\n\na=1\n\nq\u0307\nX\n\n(3.3)\n\nm\u0227 = 0.\n\n\u0227=1\u0307\n\nThe set of charge vectors, whose components are constrained by (3.3), forms the\ngroup\n\u0393 = Zp+q\u22121 .\n(3.4)\nWe should not regard the group \u0393 as the group characterizing the conserved charge\nof fractional D3-branes because D3-brane distributions corresponding to different\nelements of \u0393 may be continuously deformed to one another. We should regard\ncharges of such brane configurations as the same.\nLet us move NS5-brane a in the positive direction along S1 until it comes back\nto the original position. This process does not change the frame, but changes the\ncharge vector. When the NS5-brane passes through an D5-brane \u1e03, ma decreases by\none and m\u1e03 increases by one. (Now we assume k = 1.) When the NS5-brane comes\nback to the original position, the charge vector changes by\nva = (0, . . . , \u2212q, . . . , 0|1, . . . , 1) = \u2212qea +\n\nq\u0307\nX\n\ne\u1e03 \u2208 \u0393,\n\n(3.5)\n\n\u1e03=1\u0307\n\nwhere ea (e\u1e03 ) is the unit vectors whose a-th (\u1e03-th) component is 1. Note that ea and\ne\u1e03 themselves are not elements of \u0393 because they do not satisfy the constraint (3.3).\nSimilarly, if we move a D5-brane \u0227 around the S1 , the charge vector changes by\nw\u0227 = (1, . . . , 1|0, . . . , \u2212p, . . . , 0) =\n\np\nX\n\neb \u2212 pe\u0227 \u2208 \u0393.\n\n(3.6)\n\nb=1\n\nWhen we identify configurations deformed by continuous deformation to one another, these vectors should be identified with 0. Therefore, the group describing the\ncharge of fractional branes is the quotient group \u0393/H where H is the subgroup of \u0393\ngenerated by the vectors va and w\u1e03 . This is given by\n\u0393/H = (Zpq\u22121 \u2295 Zp\u22121\n\u2295 Zpq )/(Zp \u2295 Zq ).\nq\n\n(3.7)\n\nIn the rest of this section, we explain how this expression of the quotient group is\nobtained.\nAs we mentioned above, the p + q vectors ea and e\u0227 are not elements of \u0393 . Let\nus choose p + q \u2212 1 linearly independent basis in \u0393 . We take the following vectors.\nfa = ea \u2212 ep\ng\u0227 = e\u0227 \u2212 eq\u0307\nh = ep \u2212 eq\u0307 .\n\n(a = 1, . . . , p \u2212 1),\n \u0307 1)),\n(\u0227 = 1\u0307, . . . , (q \u2212\n\n(3.8)\n(3.9)\n(3.10)\n\n\fN = 4 Chern-Simons theories and wrapped M-branes in their gravity duals\n\n9\n\nWe can easily check that these vectors span \u0393 .

We first perform T-duality transformation along\nx6 and then lift the system to M-theory configuration. As the result we have the\nconfiguration shown in Table III.

This is nothing but the orbifold\nMp,q in (2.3).\nFractional M2-branes are realized as M5-branes wrapped on 3-cycles in Mp,q .\nThe homologies Hi (Mp,q , Z) are given by\u2217)\nH2 = Zp+q\u22122 ,\n\nH0 = Z,\n\nH1 = 0,\n\nH4 = 0,\n\nH5 = Zp+q\u22122 ,\n\nH6 = 0,\n\nH3 = (Zpq\u22121 \u2295 Zp\u22121\n\u2295 Zpq )/(Zp \u2295 Zq ),\nq\nH7 = Z.\n\n(4.1)\n\nThe relevant homology H3 (Mp,q , Z) is pure torsion, and it coincides with the group\nof fractional D3-branes studied in the previous section. In the following we explain\nhow the H3 group in (4.1) is obtained.\nWe obtained these homologies by careful search for cycles in the manifold. We have checked\ntheir consistency with the Poincare duality and the Mayer-Vietoris exact sequence.\n\u2217)\n\n\f10\n\nY. Imamura and S. Yokoyama\n\nFor the purpose of considering cycles in Mp,q , it is convenient to represent Mp,q\nas a T2 fibration over B = S5 . This fibration is defined in the following way. We\nintroduce a real coordinate 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1 by rewriting (2.11) as\n|z1 |2 + |z2 |2 = t,\n\n|z3 |2 + |z4 |2 = 1 \u2212 t.\n\n(4.2)\n\nAt a generic value of t, this defines two 3-spheres, and the orbifold action (2.4) makes\nthem Lens spaces Lp and Lq . The manifold Mp,q is represented as Lp \u00d7 Lq fibration\nover the segment 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1. Each of Lens spaces Lp and Lq can be represented as\nS1 fibration over 2-sphere. For Lp , which is rotated by the SU (2)A R-symmetry, we\nrefer to the base manifold and the fiber as S2A and \u03b1-cycle, respectively. We also\ndefine S2B and \u03b2-cycle for the other Lens space Lq , which is rotated by SU (2)B .\n(Figure 3) Due to the Zp \u2295 Zq orbifolding, the periods of \u03b1 and \u03b2-cycles ara 2\u03c0/p\n\nFig. 3. The orbifold is represented as a fibration over the segment 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1.\n\nand 2\u03c0/q, respectively. If we combine S2A , S2B , and the segment parameterized by\nt, they form a 5-sphere B = S5 . We can regard the orbifold Mp,q as a T2 fibration\nover B.\nAt t = 0, which defines S2 \u2282 B, the Lens space Lp shrinks and so does the\n\u03b1-cycle. Similarly, on S2 \u2282 B with t = 1 the \u03b2-cycle shrinks. These S2 link to\neach other in B. By blowing up the singularities, these S2 s split into p and q S2 s,\nrespectively.\u2217) We call them xa (a = 1, . . . , p) and y\u0227 (\u0227 = 1\u0307, . . . , q\u0307). (Figure 4) We\ncan follow the IIB/M duality to see that each of them corresponds to the fivebrane\nwith the same index.\n3-cycles in Mp,q can be represented as T2 fibrations over segments in the base\nmanifold B = S5 . There are three types of segments connecting two loci of degenerate fiber. (Figure 4) We denote a segment connecting a point in xa and a point in\nWe blow-up the singularities only to make cycles well-defined. When we compute the volume\nof five-cycles later, we consider the orbifold limit.\n\u2217)\n\n\fN = 4 Chern-Simons theories and wrapped M-branes in their gravity duals 11\n\nFig. 4. The three segments connecting cycles are examples of three types of three-cycles in the\norbifold.\n\nxb by [xa , xb ]. We similarly define [y\u0227 , y\u1e03 ] and [xa , y\u1e03 ]. We also adopt the notation\nS \u03b1 , S \u03b2 , S \u03b1\u03b2 \u2282 Mp,q\n\n(4.3)\n\nfor the manifold obtained by combining a subset S \u2282 B and fibers indicated as\nsuperscripts. S \u03b1\u03b2 is the T2 fibration over S. S \u03b1\u03b2 can be regarded as \u03b2-fibration\nover a certain base manifold, which is isomorphic to S \u03b1 . S \u03b1 is a global section in this\nfiber bundle. Therefore, S \u03b1 can be defined only when \u03b2-cycle fibration over S has\na global section. Similarly, we can define S \u03b2 when \u03b1-cycle fiber has trivial topology\nover S.\nWith these notations, we can represent 3-cycles generating H3 as\n[xa , xb ]\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n\n[y\u0227 , y\u1e03 ]\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n\n[xa , y\u1e03 ]\u03b1\u03b2 .\n\n(4.4)\n\nBecause one of \u03b1 and \u03b2 cycles shrinks at the endpoints of the segments, these are\nclosed 3-cycles. The topology of [xa , xb ]\u03b1\u03b2 and [y\u0227 , y\u1e03 ]\u03b1\u03b2 is S2 \u00d7 S1 , and that of\n[xa , y\u1e03 ]\u03b1\u03b2 is S3 .\nThese 3-cycles are not linearly independent. There are combinations of cycles\nwhich can be unwrapped. Let us consider\np\nX\n[xa , y\u1e03 ]\u03b1\u03b2 .\n\n(4.5)\n\na=1\n\nThis union of 3-cycles can be unwrapped in Mp,q . This can be shown by giving a\n4-chain whose boundary is (4.5). Such an \"unwrapping chain\" is constructed in the\nfollowing way. Because \u03c02 (S5 ) = 0, there is a three dimensional disk D3 \u2282 B whose\nboundary is y\u1e03 . (The gray disk in Figure 5) We call this Y\u1e03 . (We also define Xa in\nthe same way for xa .) This disk intersects once with every xa (a = 1, . . . , p). Let\n\u0232\u1e03 be the subset of Y\u1e03 obtained by removing segments connecting these intersecting\npoints and y\u1e03 (the segments in Fig 5) from the disk.\np\nX\n[xa , y\u1e03 ].\n\u0232\u1e03 = Y\u1e03 \\\n\n(4.6)\n\na=1\n\nBecause \u0232\u1e03 is contractible, we can define \u0232\u1e03\u03b2 . (Note that we cannot define Y\u1e03\u03b2 because\nthe \u03b1 cycle is twisted around the intersecting points of Y\u1e03 and xa .) We can see that\n\n\f12\n\nY. Imamura and S. Yokoyama\n\nFig. 5. The \u03b2-cycle fibration over the gray disk with the segments removed is an example of unwrapping four-chains.\n\nthe boundary of the manifold \u0232 \u03b2 is\n\u1e03\n\n\u2202 \u0232\u1e03\u03b2\n\np\nX\n[xa , y\u1e03 ]\u03b1\u03b2 .\n=\n\n(4.7)\n\na=1\n\nThis may seem at first sight strange because although \u0232\u1e03\u03b2 does not wrap the \u03b1-cycle\nits boundary does. Let us explain this situation by taking Hopf fibration of S3 as a\nsimple example. By the Hopf fibration S3 is described as the S1 fibration over S2 .\nLet (\u03b8, \u03c6) be the polar coordinates of the base S2 . The first Chern class of this fiber\nbundle is 1, so that we cannot globally define the coordinate of the fiber. We cover\nthe base S2 bytwo patches, north patch (0 \u2264 \u03b8 < \u03c0) and south patch (0 < \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0),\nand define fiber coordinate 0 \u2264 \u03c8 \u2264 2\u03c0 separately in each patch. Let \u03c8N and \u03c8S be\nthat in north and south patch, respectively. These two coordinats are paseted by the\nrelation \u03c8N = \u03c8S + \u03c6. Due to the non-vanishing first Chern class, we cannot take\na global section in this fiber bundle. In order to define sections, we need to remove\nat least one point from the base S2 . Let us take south patch. We can define, for\nexample, the section\n0 < \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0,\n\n0 \u2264 \u03c6 < 2\u03c0,\n\n\u03c8S = 0.\n\n(4.8)\n\nAt the boundary \u03b8 = 0 of south patch, the north pole, this section wrap the fiber S1 .\nThis becomes obvious if we use the coordinate \u03c8N , which includes the north pole.\nThe boundary is given by\n\u03b8 = \u03c0,\n\n0 \u2264 \u03c6 < 2\u03c0,\n\n\u03c8N = \u03c6.\n\n(4.9)\n\nThis winds once along the fiber S1 . This result makes sense from the fact that the\nhomology H1 (S3 ) vanishes. Any 1-cycle on S3 can be unwrapped and represented\nas the boundary of a 2-chain.\nBy exchanging the role of Xa and Y\u1e03 , we can also show\n\u2202 X\u0304a\u03b1\n\n=\n\nq\u0307\nX\n\u1e03=1\n\n[xa , y\u1e03 ]\u03b1\u03b2 .\n\n(4.10)\n\n\fN = 4 Chern-Simons theories and wrapped M-branes in their gravity duals 13\nFrom (4.7) and (4.10), we obtain the homology relation\np\nX\n\n[xa , y\u1e03 ]\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\na=1\n\nq\u0307\nX\n[xa , y\u1e03 ]\u03b1\u03b2 = 0.\n\n(4.11)\n\n\u1e03=1\u0307\n\nTo clarify the relation between the IIB picture and the M-theory picture, we\ndefine formal basis xa and y\u1e03 and rewrite cycles as [xa , xb ]\u03b1\u03b2 = xa \u2212 xb and so on. A\ngeneral superposition of cycles, which is depicted as a junction in B, can be written\nas a linear combination\nq\u0307\np\nX\nX\nm\u0227 y\u0227 ,\n(4.12)\nma xa +\nj=\na=1\n\n\u0227=1\u0307\n\nwhere the coefficients must satisfy the constraint (3.3). We have one to one correspondence between 3-cycles in Mp,q and D3-brane distributions in IIB picture by\nsimply identifying the coefficients in (4.12) to the components of the charge vector\n(3.2). Via this isomorphism the boundaries (4.7) and (4.10) correspond to w\u1e03 and\nva , the generators of H, and the relation (4.11) defines the homology H3 as the same\ncoset group \u0393/H in (3.7).\n\u00a75.\n\nFive cycles and baryonic operators\n\nIn this section, we discuss the relation between M5-branes wrapped on five cycles\nand baryonic operators in the N = 4 Chern-Simons theory. In the case of ABJM\nmodel, such analysis is done in 21), and the conformal dimension and multiplicity\nof baryonic operators are reproduced on the gravity side. We extend the results to\nN = 4 Chern-Simons theories.\nAs in the previous section, we consider k = 1 case. As is given in (4.1), the\nfive-cycle homology of Mp,q is\nH5 (Mp,q , Z) = Zp+q\u22122 ,\n\n(5.1)\n\nand when p + q \u2265 3, there exist non-trivial cycles on which M5-branes can be\nwrapped. If we represent Mp,q as the T2 fibration over B = S5 , the five-cycles can\nbe written as the T2 fibrations over three-disks.\n\u03a9a := Xa\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n\n\u03a9\u0227 := Y\u0227\u03b1\u03b2 .\n\n(5.2)\n\nThese generate the homology H5 (Mp,q , Z).\nThe number of the cycles in (5.2) is larger than the dimension of H5 (Mp,q , Z) by\ntwo, and there should be two relations among the cycles in (5.2). Indeed, we have\nthe following homology relations\np\nX\na=1\n\n\u03a9a =\n\nq\u0307\nX\n\u0227=1\u0307\n\n\u03a9\u0227 = 0.\n\n(5.3)\n\n\f14\n\nY. Imamura and S. Yokoyama\n\nAs we have done in section \u00a74 for three-cycles, we can give these linear combinations\nas the boundaries of unwrapping 6-chains. We define a submanifold B\u0304 \u2282 B by\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u1e57\np\nX\nX\nY\u0227 \uf8f8 .\nB\u0304 = B\\ \uf8ed\nXa +\n(5.4)\na=1\n\n\u0227=1\u0307\n\nIf we could draw S2 enclosing xa in B\u0304, the \u03b1-cycle fiber would have non-trivial twist\non the S2 . However, such S2 do not exist in B\u0304 because we removed the disks Xa .\nThus the \u03b1-cycle fiber over B\u0304 has trivial topology and we can define global sections.\nSimilarly, thanks to the removal of Y\u0227 , the \u03b2-cycle fiber also have the trivial topology.\nBecause there is a global section associated with \u03b1-cycle over B\u0304, the manifold B\u0304 \u03b2 is\nwell-defined, and its boundary is\n\u2202 B\u0304 \u03b2 =\n\np\nX\n\nXa\u03b1\u03b2 .\n\n(5.5)\n\nq\u0307\nX\n\nY\u0227\u03b1\u03b2 .\n\n(5.6)\n\na=1\n\nWe also obtain\n\u2202 B\u0304 \u03b1 =\n\n\u0227=1\n\nAs a result, we obtain the relations (5.3).\nWhat are the corresponding baryonic operators on the gauge theory side? A\nnatural guess is that these five-cycles are dual to the following operators in the\nChern-Simons theory:\n\u03a9a \u2194 Ba\u03b11 \u03b12 ***\u03b1N = \u01ebi1 ***iN \u01ebj1 ***jN h\u03b1a 1 ij11 * * * h\u03b1a N ijNN ,\n\n(5.7)\n\n\u03a9\u0227 \u2194 B\u0227\u03b1\u03071 \u03b1\u03072 ***\u03b1\u0307N = \u01ebi1 ***iN \u01ebj1 ***jN h\u03b1\u0307\u0227 1 ij11 * * * h\u0227\u03b1\u0307N ijNN .\n\n(5.8)\n\nEach of these operators is charged under the baryonic symmetry GB , and cannot be\ndecomposed into mesonic operators, which are GB neutral. However, the products\np\nY\n\nBa ,\n\na=1\n\nq\u0307\nY\n\n(5.9)\n\nB\u0227\n\n\u0227=1\n\ncarry the same baryonic charge as eiN \u00e3 and e\u2212iN \u00e3 , respectively, and by multiplying\nappropriate power of operator ei\u00e3 , we can construct neutral operators with respect\nto the baryonic symmetries. This strongly suggests that these can be decomposable\nto the mesonic operators as\n\u2212iN \u00e3\n\ne\n\np\nY\n\na=1\n\nN\n\nBa \u223c b ,\n\niN \u00e3\n\ne\n\nq\u0307\nY\n\nB\u0227 \u223c b\u0303N .\n\n(5.10)\n\n\u0227=1\n\nThis decomposability corresponds to the homology relation (5.3) among the five\ncycles.\nAs a non-trivial check of the duality, let us compare the mass of the wrapped\nM5-branes and the conformal dimension of the operators. According to the standard\n\n\fN = 4 Chern-Simons theories and wrapped M-branes in their gravity duals 15\nAdS/CFT dictionary, the conformal dimension \u2206 of an operator and the mass M of\nthe corresponding object are related by \u2206 = RAdS4 M . In the case of an M5-brane\nwrapped on \u03a9a , this relation becomes\nN pq\nVol(\u03a9a ).\n(5.11)\n2\u03c0 3\nwhere Vol(\u03a9a ) is the volume of the 5-cycle \u03a9a in Mp,q with radius 1, and to obtain\nthe last expression we used (2.13) with k = 1 and the M5-brane tension TM 5 =\n2\u03c0/(2\u03c0lp )6 . Let us calculate the volume of the 5-cycle. The 5-cycle \u03a9a , which is\nrepresented as a fiber bundle over the segment 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1, is illustrated as the shaded\nregion in Figure 6. The radii of two 3-spheres defined by (4.2) are r1 = t1/2 and\n\u2206 = RAdS4 TM 5 RS5 7 Vol(\u03a9a ) =\n\nFig. 6. The shaded region is a nontrivial 5-cycle Xa\u03b1\u03b2 .\n\nr2 = (1 \u2212 t)1/2 , respectively. The cross-section at t is S1 \u00d7 S2 \u00d7 S1 with their radii\nr1 /p, r2 /2, r2 /q, respectively\u2217) . Hence the volume of the 5-cycle is\n\u0013 \u0012 \u0010 \u0011 \u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\nZ t=1 \u0012\n2\u03c0r1\n2\u03c0r2\n\u03c03\nr2 2\nds\nVol(\u03a9a ) =\n\u00d7\n,\n(5.12)\n\u00d7 4\u03c0\n=\np\n2\nq\npq\nt=0\nwhere ds is the line element with respect to the parameter t computed as\nds2 = dr12 + dr22 =\n\n1\ndt2 .\n4t(1 \u2212 t)\n\n(5.13)\n\n(The volume (5.12) is simply Vol(S5 )/pq because the five-cycles considered here\nare orbifolds of large S5 in S7 .) We obtain the same result for 5-cycles Y\u0227\u03b1\u03b2 . By\nsubstituting this into (5.11) we obtain\n1\n(5.14)\n\u2206 = N,\n2\nand this agrees with the conformal dimension of the baryonic operators (5.7) and\n(5.8). (5.14) is consistent with the result of more general analysis in 36) for generic\ntoric tri-Sasakian manifolds.\nIt is known that when a unit S3 is represented by the S1 fibration over S2 , the radii of S1\nand S are 1 and 1/2 respectively.\n\u2217)\n\n2\n\n\f16\n\nY. Imamura and S. Yokoyama\n\nThe degeneracy of the baryonic operators are explained in the same way as\nthe Klebanov-Witten theory.22) The collective coordinates of five-cycle \u03a9a are the\ncoordinates in the transverse direction S2A , on which SU (2)A acts as rotation. The\nseven-form flux in the background plays a role of magnetic field on S2A and the\namount of the flux is N . Therefore, the effective theory of the corrective coordinates\nis the theory of a charged particle in S2A with N unit magnetic flux. The ground\nstates of the particle are the N + 1 states at the lowest Landau level37) belonging\nto the spin N/2 representation of SU (2)A . This degeneracy agrees with that of the\nbaryonic operators Ba . In the same way, we can explain the degeneracy of B\u0227 as\nthat of the lowest Landau level of a charged particle in the transverse direction S2B .\n\u00a76.\n\nGeneralization to k \u2265 2\n\nIn this section we generalize the analysis in the previous sections to the case of\nk \u2265 2.\nLet us first consider fractional D3-brane charges in the type IIB brane setup.\nWe can realize the Chern-Simons theory at level k by replacing D5-branes by (k, 1)\nfivebranes. We can again represent distributions of D3-branes by charge vectors (3.2)\nwith their components constrained by (3.3). The only difference from the k = 1 case\nis that when a (k, 1)-brane and an NS5-brane pass through each other, not one but\nk D3-branes are generated. As a result, the vectors (3.5) and (3.6) are multiplied\nby the extra factor k. Namely, we should replace the subgroup H by kH which is\ngenerated by kva and kw\u0227 , and the quotient group becomes\nq\u22121\n\u0393/(kH) = (\u0393/kH \u2032 )/(H/H \u2032 ) = (Zp\u22121\nkq \u2295 Zkp \u2295 Zkpq )/(Zp \u2295 Zq ).\n\n(6.1)\n\nOn the other hand, the homologies Hi (Mp,q,k , Z) are\nH2 = Zp+q\u22122 ,\n\nH0 = Z,\n\nH 1 = Zk ,\n\nH4 = 0,\n\nH5 = Zp+q\u22122 \u2295 Zk ,\n\nq\u22121\nH3 = (Zkp\n\u2295 Zp\u22121\nkq \u2295 Zkpq )/(Zp \u2295 Zq ),\n\nH6 = 0,\n\nH7 = Z.\n\n(6.2)\n\nWe find that the homology H3 is again identical to (6.1). Let us construct the\nhomology H3 (Mp,q,k , Z) more explicitly. When the level k is greater than 1, we have\nadditional Zk factor in the orbifold group. As is shown in (2.5), the generator of Zk\nshifts both \u03b1 and \u03b2 cycle by 1/k of their periods. Because two cycles nowhere shrink\nat the same time, this action does not generate fixed points. The Zk identification\nin the T2 fiber generates new cycles, which are not integral linear combinations of\n\u03b1 and \u03b2. They are multiples of\n\u03b3=\n\n1\n(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2).\nk\n\n(6.3)\n\nAs a result, the 2-cycle defined as the product of \u03b1 and \u03b2 is not the fundamental\nT2 but its multiple kT2 . Thus the cycles (4.4) are decomposed into k copies of the\nfollowing elementary cycles.\n[xa , xb ]\u03b1\u03b3 ,\n\n[y\u0227 , y\u1e03 ]\u03b1\u03b3 ,\n\n[xa , y\u1e03 ]\u03b1\u03b3 .\n\n(6.4)\n\n\fN = 4 Chern-Simons theories and wrapped M-branes in their gravity duals 17\nDue to this fact, the boundary of unwrapping 4-chains (4.10) and (4.7) are replaced\nby\nq\u0307\np\nX\nX\n\u2202 X\u0304a\u03b1 = k(\u2212qxa +\ny\u1e03 ), \u2202 \u0232\u0227\u03b2 = k(\nxb \u2212 py\u0227 ),\n(6.5)\nb=1\n\n\u1e03=1\u0307\n\nwhere we defined the formal basis xa and y\u0227 by [xa , xb ]\u03b1\u03b3 = xa \u2212 xb and so on.\nThese precisely correspond to the vectors kva and kw\u0227 , and thus the homology H3\nbecomes isomorphic to the quotient \u0393/kH in (6.1).\nNext, let us consider the relation between baryonic operators and 5-cycle homology H5 for k \u2265 2. In the case of k \u2265 2, the generators of the homology in (5.2)\nshould be replaced by\n\u03a9a = Xa\u03b1\u03b3 , \u03a9\u0227 = Y\u0227\u03b1\u03b3 ,\n(6.6)\nand M5-branes wrapped on these generating cycles are identified with the baryonic\noperators Ba and B\u0227 . We can again easily check that the volume of the five-cycles\ncorrectly reproduce the conformal dimension \u2206 = N/2. The p+q generators (6.6) are\nnot linearly independent, and we can take B\u0304 \u03b1 , B\u0304 \u03b2 , and B\u0304 \u03b3 as unwrapping 6-chains\nwhich give the relation among these generators. Their boundaries are\nq\u0307\nX\n\n\u2202 B\u0304 \u03b1 =\n\nq\u0307\nX\n\nY\u0227\u03b1\u03b2 = k\n\n\u2202 B\u0304 \u03b2 =\n\np\nX\n\nXa\u03b1\u03b2 = k\n\n\u0227=1\u0307\n\n\u03b3\n\n\u2202 B\u0304 =\n\na=1\np\nX\n\nXa\u03b3\u03b2\n\na=1\n\n+\n\n\u0227=1\u0307\np\nX\n\n\u03a9\u0227 ,\n\n(6.7)\n\n\u03a9a ,\n\n(6.8)\n\na=1\nq\u0307\nX\n\nY\u0227\u03b3\u03b1\n\n=\n\np\nX\n\n\u03a9a +\n\na=1\n\n\u0227=1\u0307\n\nq\u0307\nX\n\n\u03a9\u0227 .\n\n(6.9)\n\n\u0227=1\u0307\n\nNamely, these linear combinations of five-cycles are in trivial element of the homology\nH5 . By dividing the group Zp+q generated by the p + q basis \u03a9a and \u03a9\u0227 by its\nsubgroup Z2 generated by the above boundaries, we obtain the H5 homology in\n(6.2).\nOn the field theory side, the linear dependence of the five-cycles are interpreted\nas the decomposability of the products of the baryonic operators into the mesonic\noperators. The first two, (6.7) and (6.8), correspond to the product of Ba and B\u0227 ,\nrespectively, and are decomposed into N -th power of operators defined in (2.10).\n\u2212iN \u00e3\n\ne\n\np\nY\n\nBak\n\nN\n\n\u223cb ,\n\niN \u00e3\n\ne\n\na=1\n\nq\u0307\nY\n\nB\u0227k \u223c b\u0303N ,\n\n(6.10)\n\n\u0227=1\n\nThe third boundary (6.9) corresponds to the product of all the p + q baryonic operators, and it can be decomposed into trace operators.\n\uf8f6N\n\uf8eb\nq\u0307\np\nq\u0307\np\nY\nY\nY\nY\nh\u0227 )\uf8f8 .\n(6.11)\nha\nB\u0227k \u223c \uf8edtr(\nBak\na=1\n\n\u0227=1\n\na=1\n\n\u0227=1\u0307\n\n\f18\n\nY. Imamura and S. Yokoyama\n\nThe degeneracy of baryonic operators for p + q \u2265 3 are again reproduced in the\nsame way as the k = 1 case. In the case of p = q = 1 (ABJM model), we need a\nspecial treatment because the global symmetry (2.7) is enhanced to SU (4)\u00d7U (1) and\nthe motion of collective coordinates are treated as a point particle in SU (4)/(SU (3)\u00d7\nU (1)). This is considered in 21) and the correct multiplicity is obtained.\n\u00a77.\n\nQuark-baryon transition\n\nIn \u00a75, we studied the relation between wrapped M5-branes and baryonic operators BI . We can relate them more directly by using IIB/M duality explained\nin \u00a74. By following the duality, we can easily see that an M5-brane wrapped on\n\u03a9I is dual to a D3-brane disk ending on fivebrane I, and as we explain below, the\nD3-brane disk can be continuously deformed to N open strings corresponding to the\nconstituent bi-fundamental quarks. (Similar transition in different brane systems are\nalso considered in 38), 39).)\nBefore we explain the deformation, we comment on a relevant fact about flux\nconservation on the worldvolume of a D3-brane ending on an NS5-brane. The U (1)\ngauge field A on an NS5-brane electrically couples to endpoints of D-strings on the\nNS5-brane. This is the case, too, for magnetic flux f = da on D3-branes, which can\nbe regarded as D-strings dissolved in the D3-brane worldvolume. This coupling is\ndescribed as the action\nI\n1\nS=\nA \u2227 f.\n(7.1)\n2\u03c0 \u2202D3\nBy integrating by part, this is rewritten as\nI\n1\nS=\na \u2227 F,\n2\u03c0 \u2202D3\n\n(7.2)\n\nand this implies that the flux F = dA on the NS5-brane behaves as an electric charge\non the boundary of the D3-brane coupled by the gauge field a. If the D3-brane\nworldvolume is compact, the electric flux conservation requires the total electric\ncharge vanish. If the integral of flux F over the D3-brane boundary is 2\u03c0N , we need\nN strings ending on the D3-brane worldvolume to compensate the boundary charge.\nThis is also the case for a D3-brane ending on a (k, 1) fivebrane.\nBaring this fact in mind, we can show that N open strings and a D3-brane disk\ncan be continuously deformed to each other. In the following we treat three sets of\nD3-branes, and for distinction we name them as follows:\n\u2022 X \u2013 the coincident N D3-branes between fivebranes I and I \u2212 1.\n\u2022 Y \u2013 the coincident N D3-branes between fivebranes I and I + 1.\n\u2022 D \u2013 a D3-brane disk whose boundary is S2 on fivebrane I.\nWe here assume that NI = NI\u22121 = N . Let us start from a D3-brane disk D whose\nboundary is S2 on the fivebrane I enclosing the both boundaries of X and Y . ((a)\nin Figure 7) Although these boundaries carry magnetic charges coupled by A, their\ncharges cancel each other, and the net flux passing through the boundary \u2202D is zero.\nThere are no open strings ending on D.\n\n\fN = 4 Chern-Simons theories and wrapped M-branes in their gravity duals 19\n\nFig. 7. Quark-baryon transition\n\nWe move the disk so that \u2202Y , the boundary of Y , gets out of \u2202D. When \u2202Y\npasses through \u2202D, the flux through \u2202D jumps by N , and N open strings stretched\nbetween Y and D are generated so that the total electric charge on the disk cancels.\n((b) in Figure 7)\nIf we keep moving the disk and \u2202X also gets out of the boundary \u2202D, the flux\nthrough the boundary jumps again by \u2212N , and this time N open strings stretched\nbetween D and X are generated. Two sets of N strings can be connected to get off\nfrom D, and we obtain N open strings connecting X and Y . ((c) in Figure 7) The\ndisk can annihilate without any obstructions.\nIf mI = NI \u2212 NI\u22121 6= 0, the D3-brane disk D in Figure 7 (a) is accompanied by\nmI strings attached on it. This corresponds to the fact that we cannot define such\nSU (NI\u22121 )\u00d7SU (NI ) invariant operators as (5.7) and (5.8) due to the mismatch of the\nnumber of indices. The mI open strings attached on the D3-brane disk corresponds\nto mI fundamental or \u2212mI anti-fundamental indices which are not contracted.\n\u00a78.\n\nThree-form torsion and fractional branes\n\nIn this section, we relate the fractional brane charge and integrals of the 3-form\nfield on 3-cycles. Let us consider a process in which the number of the fractional\nbranes changes. The fractional brane charge Q \u2208 H3 affects the 3-form field C3 and\nmeasured by the integrals over 3 cycles \u03b6\nI\nC3 , \u03b6 \u2208 H 3 .\n(8.1)\n\u03b6\n\nWe define the period integral at r = r0 between the horizon r = 0 and the AdS\nboundary r = \u221e. To change the fractional brane charge by \u2206Q, we add an M5brane wrapped on a 3-cycle \u2206Q \u2208 H3 at the AdS boundary, and move it to the\nhorizon. When the M5-brane pass through r = r0 , the period integrals changes by\nI\n(8.2)\n\u2206 C3 = 2\u03c0h\u03b6, \u2206Qi,\n\u03b6\n\nwhere h\u2217, \u2217i is a map H3 \u00d7 H3 \u2192 U (1), so called the torsion linking form, or, simply,\nthe linking number.\n\n\f20\n\nY. Imamura and S. Yokoyama\n\nThe linking number is defined as follows. Let s be the order of \u03b6. Namely, s is\nthe smallest positive integer such that s\u03b6 is homologically trivial. Such an integer\nalways exists because H3 is pure torsion. There exists a 4-chain D such that\n(8.3)\n\ns\u03b6 = \u2202D.\nWe define the linking number h\u03b6, \u03b7i of two 3-cycles \u03b6 and \u03b7 by\n1\nh\u03b6, \u03b7i = hhD, \u03b7ii.\ns\n\n(8.4)\n\nwhere hhD, \u03b7ii is the intersection number of the 4-chain C and 3-cycle \u03b7. Because\nthis number jumps by integers by continuous deformations, only the fractional part\nof the linking number is a topological invariant.\nIf we move an M5-brane wrapped on the 3-cycle \u2206Q from the AdS boundary to\nthe horizon, when it passes through r = r0 , the M5-brane intersect with the 4-chain\nD at hhD, \u03b7ii points. In this process, the four-form flux G4 passing through D,\nincluding the contribution of Dirac's string-like objects, changes by 2\u03c0hhD, \u03b6ii. By\nusing Stokes' theorem we obtain the relation (8.2).\nFor the manifold Mp,q,k , following the definition of the linking number, we can\neasily obtain\nkhva , ji = ma , khw\u0227 , ji = m\u0227 ,\n(8.5)\nfor a general 3-cycle j in (4.12). The linking numbers among the basis are\nhxa , xb i = \u2212\n\n1\n\u03b4ab ,\nkq\n\nhy\u0227 , y\u1e03 i = \u2212\n\n1\n\u03b4 ,\nkp \u0227\u1e03\n\nhxa , y\u1e03 i = \u2212\n\n1\n.\n2kpq\n\n(8.6)\n\nDue to the constraint (3.3), the linking number among the basis is not unique. For\nexample, a constant shift of all the linking numbers in (8.6) does not affect the linking\nnumbers for 3-cycles which are linear combination of the basis with the coefficient\nconstrained by (3.3).\nBy \"integrating\" the relation (8.2) and using (8.5), we obtain\nI\nI\nk\nk\n0\n0\nma \u2212 ma =\nC3 ,\n(8.7)\nC3 , m\u0227 \u2212 m\u0227 =\n2\u03c0 va\n2\u03c0 w\u0227\nwhere m0a and m0\u0227 are integration constants which cannot be determined from (8.2).\nAlthough gauge transformations can change the period integrals of C3 , the relation (8.7) determines a element of \u0393/kH in a gauge invariant way if we know m0a\nand m0\u0227 because large gauge transformation change the charge vector by an element\nof kH.\nAn important fact is that the constants ma and m\u0227 depend on the frame, the\norder of fivebranes. The right hand side of the relations (8.7) are defined on M-theory\nside, and is independent of the frame, while ma and m\u0227 on the left hand side change\nby multiples of k when we change the order of fivebranes. This means that m0a and\nm0\u0227 depends on the frame, and we cannot simply set them to be zero.\nTo obtain some information about the constants, we use branes corresponding to\nbaryonic operators. Remember that in the IIB setup baryonic operators correspond\n\n\fN = 4 Chern-Simons theories and wrapped M-branes in their gravity duals 21\nto D3-brane disks ending on fivebranes, and when mI 6= 0, they are accompanied by\nmI open strings.\nA similar phenomenon occurs on the M-theory side. If there is non-trivial background C-field M5-branes wrapped on five-cycles are accompanied by M2-branes\nattached on their worldvolume, and by identifying these M2-branes to strings in the\nIIB setup, we obtain relations between mI and background C-field.\nLet us consider the flux conservation on M5-branes and how it relates the background C-field and M2-branes attached on it.

On the worldvolume of\nan M5-brane wrapped on a five-cycle the total charge coupled by b2 must cancel due\nto the flux conservation. This implies that, the cohomology class of the total charge\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\nG4 \u2212 \u03b4(\u2202M 2) \u2208 H 4 (\u03a9I , Z)\n(8.9)\n2\u03c0\nmust be trivial. \u03b4(\u2202M 2) is the four-form delta function with support on the boundaries of M2-branes. By the Poincare duality, this is equivalent to\n(8.10)\n\n[g] = [\u2202M 2] \u2208 H1 (\u03a9I , Z),\nwhere g is the one-cycle Poincare dual to the flux (2\u03c0)\u22121 G4 .\nHi (\u03a9a , Z) in the five-cycle are given by\nH0 = Z,\n\nH 1 = Zk ,\n\nH2 = Zq\u22121 ,\n\nH3 = Zq\u22121 \u2295 Zk ,\n\nH4 = 0,\n\nThe homologies\nH5 = Z. (8.11)\n\nThe homologies in \u03a9\u0227 are obtained by replacing q in (8.11) by p.

It is \u03b6 = va for \u03a9a\nand \u03b6 = w\u0227 for \u03a9\u0227 . If we identify mI strings ending on a D3-brane disk with a\nM2-brane wrapped on mI \u03b3 where \u03b3 is the generator of H1 (Mp,q,k , Z) = H1 (\u03a9I , Z),\n(8.12) can be rewritten as\nI\nI\nk\nk\nma =\nC3 mod k.\n(8.13)\nC3 , m\u0227 =\n2\u03c0 va\n2\u03c0 w\u0227\nThis means that\nm0a = m0\u0227 = 0 mod k.\n\n(8.14)\n\nThis fixes only the frame independent part of m0a and m0\u0227 . Although in the p = q = 1\ncase this reproduces the result in 20) for ABJM model, this is not sufficient to\nestablish the relation between the fractional brane charge and the 3-form torsion for\np + q \u2265 3. We leave this problem for future works.\n\n\f22\n\nY. Imamura and S. Yokoyama\n\u00a79.\n\nWrapped M2-branes and monopole operators\n\nThe correspondence between Kaluza-Klein modes of massless fields in the internal manifold and primary operators in the corresponding boundary CFT is one of\nmost important claim of AdS/CFT correspondence.\nSuch a correspondence for ABJM model is discussed in 10),51). For more general\nN = 2 quiver gauge theories, which describe M2-branes in toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds,\nthe relation between the holomorphic monomial functions, which are specified by the\ncharges of toric U (1) symmetries, and mesonic operators consisting of bi-fundamental\nfields, was proposed in 52). In the reference, a simple prescription to establish\nconcrete coresspondence between Kaluza-Klein modes and mesonic operators is given\nby utilizing brane crystals.39), 52), 53) When this method was proposed, it had not\nyet been realized that the quiver gauge theories are actually quiver Chern-Simons\ntheories. After the importance of the existence of Chern-Simons terms was realized,\nthis proposal was confirmed43)\u201345) for special kind of brane crystals which can be\nregarded as \"M-theory lift\" of brane tilings.46)\u201348)\nIn three-dimensional spacetime, local operators in general carry magnetic charges.\nSuch operators are called monopole operators. In the correspondence between primary operators in three-dimensional CFT and Kaluza-Klein modes, monopole operators play an important role. The results in46)\u201348) indicate that the set of primary\noperators corresponding to the supergravity Kaluza-Klein modes includes only a special kind of monopole operators, \"diagonal\" monopole operators. Diagonal monopole\noperators carries only the diagonal U (1) magnetic charges, and are constructed by\ncombining dual photon fields and chiral matter fields. The concrete examples of\ndiagonal operators have already apeared in (2.10). Because the canonical conjugate\nof the dual photon field is the diagonal U (1) field strength FD , the operator eim\u00e3\nshifts the flux FD by m.\nFor a while we consider a generic Abelian quiver N = 2 Chern-Simons theory.\nWe label verices by a and denote the corresponding gauge group by U (1)a . Let\nus consider a monopole operator with magnetic charges ma \u2208 Z. The diagonal\nmonopole operator eim\u00e3 carries the same magnetic charge ma = m for all the U (1)a\ngauge groups. The gauge invariance of the operator requires the Gauss law constraint\nma ka + Qa = 0,\n\n(9.1)\n\nwhere Qa is the U (1)a electric charge carried by matter fields included in the monopole\noperator. This guarantees the invariance of the operator under the gauge symmetry\n(2.9). By summing up this over all a, we obtain the constraint\nX\nma ka = 0.\n(9.2)\na\n\nTherefore, monopole operators are labeled by n \u2212 1 independent magnetic charges.\nOne of them is the diagonal monopole charge, and corresponds to a certain component of Kaluza-Klein momentum in the internal space (the D-particle charge from\nthe type IIA perspective).\n\n\fN = 4 Chern-Simons theories and wrapped M-branes in their gravity duals 23\nWhat are the interpretation of the other n \u2212 2 magnetic charges? It is natural to\nidentify these with the charges of M2-branes wrapped on two-cycles. Let us return\nto the N = 4 Chern-Simons theory studied in this paper, which is a special case of\nN = 2 quiver Chern-Simons theories. The two-cycle homology of the corresponding\ninternal space Mp,q,k is\nH2 (Mp,q,k , Z) = Zp+q\u22122 ,\n(9.3)\nand the Betti number coincides with the number of independent magnetic charges\nof non-diagonal monopole operatords.\nWe now explain why we did not impose GB gauge invariance on baryonic operators. First, let us remember the reason why symmetry groups which act on wrapped\nbranes are usually regarded as global symmetries. Consider AdSd+1 with the metric\nds2 =\n\nR2\n((dx\u03bc )2 + dz 2 ),\nz2\n\n\u03bc = 1, . . . , d,\n\n(9.4)\n\nand let A\u03bd (x\u03bc , z) be a U (1) gauge field coupling to wrapped branes. We follow 40)\nand consider the Euclidian AdS space. z is the radial coordinate such that the AdS\nboundary is at z = 0. Let us assume the asymptotic behavior of the vector field as\nA\u03bd \u221d z \u2206 .\n\n(9.5)\n\nFor the convergence of the Euclidian action, \u2206 must satisfy the inequality\nd\n\u2212 2 < \u2206.\n2\n\n(9.6)\n\nWith the equation of motion d \u2217 dA = 0 we obtain the asymptotic behavior of the\ngauge field\nA\u03bd (x\u03bc , z) = a\u03bd (x\u03bc ) + z d\u22122 b\u03bd (x\u03bc ).\n(9.7)\nOn the AdS boundary we need to impose boundary condition which fixes one of\na\u03bd (x\u03bc ) and b\u03bd (x\u03bc ). When d \u2265 4, only the second term in (9.7) is allowed by (9.6)\nand the boundary condition a\u03bd (x\u03bc ) = 0 must be imposed. Then the gauge field\nasymptotically vanishes near the boundary, and this is the reason why the symmetry\nis global in the boundary CFT.\nOn the other hand, when d = 3, both terms in (9.7) satisfy the inequality (9.6),\nand we can choose any one of a\u03bd (x\u03bc ) = 0 (Dirichlet) and b\u03bd (x\u03bc ) = 0 (Neumann)\nas the boundary condition. Indeed, these two boundary conditions first appeared\nin 41) and are used in 42) to construct a pair of Chern-Simons theories which are\n\"S-dual\" to each other. Let us take the Neumann boundary condition. In this case,\nthe boundary value of the gauge field a\u03bd (x\u03bc ) = A\u03bd (x\u03bc , z = 0) does not vanish, and\nis dynamical in the sense that it is path integrated. Thus we can regard this as a\ngauge field in the boundary CFT, and the wrapped branes coupled by A\u03bd should\nbe cherged objects in the boundary CFT, too. Because the Dirichlet and Neumann\nboundary conditions are exchanged by the duality transformation of the gauge field,\nboth kinds of operators corresponding to electric and magnetic particles in the AdS4\ncannot be gauge invariant .\n\n\f24\n\nY. Imamura and S. Yokoyama\n\nIn the case of our M-theory background, the gauge fields Ai = Ai\u03bd dx\u03bd coupling\nto wrapped M5-branes and \u00c3i = Ai\u03bd dx\u03bd coupling to wrapped M2-branes are defined\nby\np+q\u22122\np+q\u22122\nX\nX\ni\n\u03c9 i \u2227 \u00c3i ,\n(9.8)\n\u03c9 i \u2227 A , C3 =\nC6 =\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nwhere C3 and C6 are the three- and six-form potential field, which are dual to\neach other, and \u03c9i and \u03c9 i are cohomology basis of H 5 (Mp,q,k , Z) = Zp+q\u22122 and\np+q\u22122 , respectively. Because Ai and \u00c3 are electric-magnetic\n2 (M\nHfree\ni\np,q,k , Z) = Z\ndual to each other, it is impossible to impose the Dirichlet boundary condition on all\nof them, and consequently some of wrapped branes inevitablly correspond to gauge\nvariant operators. This is the reason why we did not require the baryonic operators\nto be GB gauge invariant. Although it may be possible to take some S-dual picture\nin which wrapped M5-branes correspond to gauge invariant operators, then we have\nto relate wrapped M2-branes to gauge variant operators.\n\u00a710.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper, we investigated some aspects in the gravity dual of N = 4 quiver\nChern-Simons theories. One is fractional branes. We confirmed that the group of\nfractional brane charge, which is obtained by the analysis of Hanany-Witten effect\nin the type IIB brane configuration, is isomorphic to the homology H3 (Mp,q,k , Z).\nWe also established the relation between the fractional brane charge and the torsion\nof the 3-form field up to the frame dependent constants. In order to determine the\nconstant part, more detailed analysis would be needed.\nWe also discuss the duality between baryonic operators in the Chern-Simons\ntheory and M5-branes wrapped on five-cycles in Mp,q,k . We defined baryonic operators which carries GB charges, and found that the homology group H5 (Mp,q,k , Z) is\nconsistent with the decomposability of products of baryonic operators into mesonic\nones on the field theory side. We also found that the conformal dimension of baryonic\noperators are consistent with the mass of the wrapped M5-branes. The degeneracy\nof the baryonic operators were explained as the degeneracy of the ground states for\nthe collective motion of the wrapped M5-branes.\nWe also commented on the relation between non-diagonal monopole operators\nand wrapped M2-branes. The two-cycle Betti number b2 of the internal manifold\nMp,q,k is found to coincides with the number of independent magnetic charges of\nnon-diagonal monopole operators.\nWe did not impose the gauge invariance on baryonic operators. In Section 9\nwe showed that some of wrapped M2-branes and wrapped M5-branes inevitablly\ncorrespond to gauge variant operators in the boundary CFT.\nThere are many questions left which should be studied. The extension of our\nanalysis to more general quiver Chern-Simons theories with smaller supersymmetry\nis one of them. Moduli spaces of N = 2 supersymmetric quiver Chern-Simons\ntheories are studied in 27), 43)\u201345). For the class of theories which described by\nbrane tilings46)\u201348) (See also 49), 50) for reviews.) there is a simple prescription to\n\n\fN = 4 Chern-Simons theories and wrapped M-branes in their gravity duals 25\nestablish the relation between toric data of Calabi-Yau 4-folds and Chern-Simons\ngauge theories.43)\u201345) It may be interesting to extend our analysis to such a large\nclass of theories.\nIn general, dual CFT of toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds cannot be described by brane\ntilings. In such a case, brane crystals39), 52), 53) are expected to play an important\nrole. The relation between brane crystals and dual CFT are not fully understood,\nand the analysis of homologies and wrapped branes may be helpful to obtain some\ninformation about dual CFT.\nWe hope we will return to these subjects in near future.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank K.
