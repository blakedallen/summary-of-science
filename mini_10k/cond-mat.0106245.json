We take the site energies\n\u03b5n (independent of \u03c4 ) to be random variables, chosen\nfrom an interval [\u2212W/2; W/2] with a uniform probability\ndistribution. The parameter W serves thus as a measure\nof disorder strength. The conductance is calculated using\nthe transfer matrix method and the Landauer formula.8\nWe have used the analytical derivation of Lee et al.9 to\ncalculate theoretical values for the UCF for both types of\nboundary conditions. In order to change the boundary\nconditions to periodic, one needs to make the following\nchanges (references to equations are from the Appendix\nof Lee et al. (1987)9): in the eigenfunctions Qm to the\ndiffusion equations, the cosines in the transverse directions (Eq. (A9)) must be replaced by exponentials with\na factor of 2\u03c0 instead of \u03c0 in the argument; this will lead\nin effect to a factor 4 in the m2x and m2y terms in the\nmodified eigenvalues \u03bb\u0303m (Eq. (A13)), and to a summation over all integers (including negative ones) for mx and\nmy in Eqs. (A15), (A16), (A24) and (A25). The results\nare presented in Table I. The values are only half those\ngiven by Lee et al. due to a factor 2 in the definition of g.\nAlso, our result for the three\u2013dimensional case is slightly\nhigher, probably due to our calculating the involved sums\nto a higher precision. The boundary conditions have of\ncourse no effect for the quasi\u2013one\u2013dimensional case. The\nvalues given here are those for the standard deviation \u03c3g\nfor the orthogonal universality class of Random Matrix\nTheory. The values for the other universality classes10\nare obtained by dividing the variance, i.e. \u03c3g2 , by the universality class parameter \u03b2, where \u03b2 = 1, 2, 4 for the\northogonal, unitary, and symplectic universality classes\nrespectively.\nIn Fig. 1 we show the standard deviation of the conductance in ensembles of 10,000 samples for different system sizes (squares with L \u00d7 L lattice sites) and boundary conditions (open symbols: periodic boundary conditions; filled symbols: hard wall boundary conditions) as\na function of the inverse of the average conductance. It is\nwell known that in a two\u2013dimensional disordered tight\u2013\nbinding model all the states are exponentially localized.5\nThe typical structure6,7 of the fluctuations with increasing disorder strength can be seen: after an initial strong\nincrease in the ballistic regime (large hgi) it reaches a\npeak value which becomes more pronounced for larger\nsystems; then the fluctuations drop back to the universal\nvalue and finally decrease again in the strongly localized\nregime. The boundary conditions have apparently no in-\n\nThe conductance fluctuations for various types for two\u2013\nand three\u2013dimensional disordered systems with hard wall and\nperiodic boundary conditions are studied, all the way from the\nballistic (metallic) regime to the localized regime. It is shown\nthat the universal conductance fluctuations (UCF) depend\non the boundary conditions. The same holds for the metal to\ninsulator transition. The conditions for observing the UCF\nare also given.\n\nPACS numbers: 71.30.+h, 71.55.Jv\nThe influence of the boundary conditions (bc) on\ncritical phenomena in disordered mesoscopic systems\nhas been demonstrated by studies of the conductance\ndistribution1\u20133 and energy level statistics.4 The ensemble average of the logarithm of the conductance, hln(g)i,\nis smaller for hard wall boundary conditions than for\nperiodic boundary conditions. The variance ln2 (g) \u2212\n2\nhln(g)i on the other hand is larger for hard wall than\nfor periodic boundary conditions. The distribution of\nnearest neighbour energy level separations P (s) becomes\nmore Wigner\u2013Dyson\u2013like for periodic boundary conditions. Thus, systems with periodic boundary conditions\nexhibit a \"more metallic\" behaviour than those with hard\nwall boundary conditions. Different boundary conditions\nalso lead to different values for the universal conductance\nfluctuations (UCF) in the diffusive metallic regime where\nthe mean free path l is much smaller and the localization\nlength \u03be much bigger than the system size. The variation\nof ensemble fluctuations of the conductance as the disorder increases throughout the metallic regime has been\nstudied,6,7 but the influence of the boundary conditions\nin the ballistic regime where l exceeds the system size,\nand close to the localized regime where \u03be becomes comparable with the system size, has not been studied in\ndetail. Also, the role of the correlation length in samples\nwith a true metal\u2013insulator\u2013transition (MIT) - i.e. in\nsystems where the localization length is \"infinite\" in the\nmetallic regime - has not been discussed. We present\nhere numerical studies of cubic systems and squares with\nspin\u2013orbit scattering - all of which have a true MIT -\nfor both hard wall and periodic boundary conditions in\nthe direction(s) perpendicular to transport.\nWe are using the tight\u2013binding model with the Hamiltonian\nX\nX\nH=\n|n\u03c4 i \u03b5n hn\u03c4 | +\n(1)\n|n\u03c4 i Vn,n\u2032 hn\u2032 \u03c4 \u2032 |\nn,\u03c4\n\nn,\u03c4,n\u2032 ,\u03c4 \u2032\n\nwhere n, n\u2032 are nearest neighbour lattice sites on a square\nor cubic lattice. For systems with spin\u2013orbit\u2013interactions\n\u03c4 and \u03c4 \u2032 take on values of +1 or \u22121 and the hopping\n1\n\n\ffluence on the behaviour outside the region of UCF in\nthis case. Notice that for the case of periodic boundary\nconditions for the large system size of L = 128, \u03c3g approaches the theoretical value of 0.393 given by the lower\nhorizontal line.\nIn Fig. 2 the same data is plotted for a two\u2013dimensional\ndisordered system of size L = 64 with periodic boundary conditions. In the same plot the mean free path and\nthe localisation length as a function of disorder strength\nW are given. Both the mean free path and the localization length were obtained from the numerical results of\nEconomou et al.5 The localization length was obtained5\nby the transfer matrix method, while the mean free path\nwas obtained by the coherent potential approximation5\n(CPA). Notice that \u03be is always larger than l. So for a\ngiven system size (L = 64 in this case), there is a finite\nregion where l \u226a L \u226a \u03be. Only in this region there is a\nplateau visible at the correct UCF\u2013value. For W \u2264 1, l is\nlarger than L, and we are in the ballistic regime where one\nobserves a monotonic increase of \u03c3g followed by the characteristic maximum as the system enters the crossover\nbetween the ballistic regime and the regime characterized by UCF.\nFig. 3 shows that the same overall behaviour is observed also for three\u2013dimensional systems. As there is a\nMIT (indicated by vertical lines in Fig. 3) where the conductance distribution and therefore also its standard deviation become universal, i.e. independent of system size\n(though still depending on the boundary conditions1\u20133 ),\nthis value is approached after leaving the region of UCF.\nA direct comparison of the results shows again that the\nboundary conditions have only minimal effect outside\nthat region. The additional peak noticeable in some of\nthe periodic boundary conditions data are due to a near\u2013\ndegeneracy of eigen\u2013energies for very small disorder.\nIn Fig. 4 we plot the data for one of the systems again\nas a function of W , together with the mean free path l\nand the correlation length \u03be. In the three\u2013dimensional\ndisordered case, the mean free path and the correlation\nlength \u03be were again obtained11 by the CPA and the transfer matrix method. The size of the cube is L = 16 and\nperiodic boundary conditions were used. In the three\u2013\ndimensional case, l drops as the disorder strength W increases, while \u03be increases as W increases. The plateau in\n\u03c3g is seen only when l \u226a L and \u03be \u2264 L, so that we expect\na wider plateau for larger systems. The fluctuations begin to approach the critical value as soon as L \u2248 \u03be. In\nthe three\u2013dimensional case too, when W \u2264 2, l is larger\nthan L and the ballistic regime is observed, followed by\nthe maximum in the crossover regime.\nFinally, Fig. 5 shows data for square systems with\nspin\u2013orbit\u2013interactions. We have chosen the Evangelou\u2013\nZiman model,12 where even in the absence of diagonal\ndisorder there is disorder in the hopping matrices Vn,n\u2032 ,\nwhich accounts for the fact that the fluctuations do not\nvanish for small diagonal disorder. Apparently, boundary\nconditions have a noticeable influence on the fluctuations\neven outside the region of UCF, but this is likely due to\n\nthe peculiar overall structure in this case, most significantly the fact that the UCF value is much smaller than\nthe critical value, causing another increase in the standard deviation as one approaches the MIT.\nIn conclusion, we have investigated the conductance\nfluctuations for various types of systems with both hard\nwall and periodic boundary conditions from the ballistic\nregime to the localized regime. The boundary conditions\nseem to have a relevant influence on the conductance fluctuation only in the region of UCF and at the critical point\nof the MIT. In true metallic systems, the fluctuations\nbegin to deviate from the UCF\u2013value and approach the\ncritical value as soon as the correlation length approaches\nthe system size.\nAmes Laboratory is operated for the U.S. Department\nof Energy by Iowa State University under Contract No.\nW\u20137405\u2013Eng\u201382.
