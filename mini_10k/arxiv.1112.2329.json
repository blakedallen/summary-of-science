The concepts of\ndirect integral of Hilbert spaces and direct integral of operators as a generalization of the\nconcept of direct sum of Hilbert spaces and direct sum of operators were introduced to\nmathematics and developed in 1949 by John von Neumann in his work\n.These subjects\nwere incorporated in several works(see\n.A spectral theory of some operators on a\nfinite sum of Hilbert spaces was investigated by N.Dunford\n.Note that,in terms of\napplication ,there are some results in papers\nin the finite sum cases .Also in the\ninfinite direct sum cases there is a work\n,in which some spectral and compactness\nproperties are surveyed.\nFurthermore,some spectral investigations of the direct integral of operators in the direct\nintegral of Hilbert spaces have been provided by T.R.Chow\n,T.R.Chow,F.Gilfeather\n,\nE.A.Azoff\nL.A.Fialkow\n.\nIt must be noted that the theory of direct integral of Hilbert spaces and operators on the\nthese spaces has important role in the representation theory of locally compact groups,in\nthe theory of decomposition rings of operators to factors,invariant measures,reduction\ntheory,von Neumann algebras and ets.On the other hand, many physical problems of today\n1\n\n\farising in the modelling of processes of multiparticle quantum mechanics , quantum field theory and\nin the physics of rigid bodies support to study a theory of direct integral of operators in the direct\nintegral of Hilbert spaces (see [19] and references in it).\nNumereous scientific investigations have been done to explain quantum measurements .Dealing\nwith these subjects, S.Machida and M.Namiki\n(see, also\nhave offered many-Hilbertspace theory lately.Also,they find that decoherence of the wave function is only necessity to\nformulate quantum mechanical measurements. A direct integral space of continiously many Hilbert\nspaces and a continious superselection rule is starring in their theory.The direct integral space\nstructure is assigned to the measurement devise which reflects its macroscopic features.On the other\nhand,observed system is left to be defined by a single Hilbert space.Furthermore,they have examined\ndouble slit experiments and negative result experiments in the framework of the many-Hilbert-space\ntheory.Note that a direct integral space of continiously many Hilbert spaces often arises in the\nquantum version of Lax-Phillips theory\n.In this investigation the direct integral space is introduced\nin order to the allow the generator of motion to have a spectrum in real axis ,which is a necessary\ncondition for the application of the Lax-Phillips theory.\nIn second section of this paper a connection between parts of spectrum, resolvent set of direct\nintegral of operators defined in the direct integral of Hilbert spaces and parts of the spectrum of\n''coordinate operators ''has been established . Note that the another approach to analogous problem\nhas been used in work\n. In this present paper sharp formulas for the connection are given. In\nthird section the compactness properties of these operators have been examined.Finally,in fourth\nsection in special case the analogous questions for the power and polynomially bounded operators\nhave been provided.\nIn the special case of direct sum of Hilbert spaces, these questions have been investigated in\n\nAlong this paper the triplet\nbe any measure space and the Hilbert spaces are\nlooked at will become infinite dimensional. In addition ,the space of compact operators and\nSchatten-von Neumann classes in any Hilbert space will be denoted by\nand\nrespectively.\n\n2. On the spectrum of direct integral of operators\nIn this section, the relationship between the spectrum and resolvent sets of the direct integral of\noperators and its coordinate operators will be investigated.\nBefore of all prove the following result.\nTheorem 2.1.For the operator\n\nin the Hilbert space\n\nare true\n,\n\n2\n\n=\n\n\fProof. For any\nthere exist element\nsuch that\n.Then almost everywhere\nwith respect to measure \u03bc it is true\n\nSince\n\n,then there exist\n\nThis means that\n\nand\n\nwhich satisfy the above equality and\nHence\n\n.\n\nand from this it is obtained that\n\nThe proof of the second proposition is clear.\nActually ,in one special case the following stronger assertions are true.\nTheorem 2.3. Assume that every one-point set is measurable and its measure is positive.

SOME COMPACTNESS PROPERTIES of DIRECT INTEGRAL of OPERATORS\n\nIn this section the compactness and spectral properties between direct integral of operators and\ntheir ''coordinate operators''have been established.In general ,there is not any relation between\nmentioned operators in compactness means.\nExample3.1.\n.\nIn this case for every\n\n-counting\n\nmeasure,\n\n) ,but\n\nExample 3.2.In some cases from the relations\n\nno implies\n\n) for every\n\nIndeed, from the definition of direct integral of operators on the set having null \u03bc-measure the\ncoordinate operators may be defined by arbitrary way.\nBut in certain situations there are concrete results.\n\n4\n\n.\n\n\fTheorem 3.3. Let \u039b\n\nbe any countable set , =\nfor every point\n.Then\n\nany measure with property\n\n,then for every\n\n(1) If\n(2)Let \u039b infinite countable set and for every\n\nand\n\nbe\n\n,\n\n.\n\n.In this case\n\nif and only if\n\nThis theorem is proved by analogous scheme of the proof in theorem 4.6 in\n\n.\n\nNow give one characterizating theorem on the point spectrum of compact direct integral of\noperators.\nTheorem 3.4.Assumed that\n,\nsubset\n\nin the Hilbert space =\n\nand\n.In this case there exist countable\nof \u039b such that the set\nis minimal and\n.\n\nFrom the definition of singular number s(.)
