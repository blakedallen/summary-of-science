Theoretical models and simulations based on a multiplicity of numerical methods have been developed and reported [3, 6, 8,\n9, 11, 12, 15, 18] as well as experiments performed on artificial platforms\nand with animals [1, 7, 10, 13]. Theoretical studies such as [6, 15] focus\non models of the viscoelastic body, while [8, 11, 12] treat the body-fluid\ncoupling and the emergence of locomotion. In [2,9,18] the main interest is\nto understand how passive thrust is generated in vortex wakes, a question\nthat remains open. Despite the considerable work done, experimental results are not fully understood and several numerical simulations are yet to\n\u2217 Artificial\n\nIntelligence Laboratory.\nUniversity of Z\u00fcrich.\ne-mail: {carbajal,naveenoid}@ifi.uzh.ch\n\n2\n\n\fbe validated. Influenced by the activity on the field, we address a parallel\nproblem related to robotics, actuation.\nFins as a tool for locomotion offer several appealing properties with\nrespect to propellers. From an environmental point of view fins reduce\nsound pollution characteristic of propellers [16]. Additionally, a flexible\nbody offers the possibility of extracting energy from the environment, as\nshown in the technological study presented in [4]. This idea is related\nto the fact that trouts exploit vortex wakes (shed by obstacles in the\nflow) to reduce the cost of swimming [5] (see [14] for a review). These\naspects are of primary relevance in situations where low environmental\nimpact and mimicry are important, as in pipes maintenance routine, or\nfor underwater life observation (scientific naiveness may make us forget\nabout military applications, we provide this short caution.). Moreover,\nin environments where moving parts may be clogged up due to fouling,\nrotatory propellers may be unfeasible for locomotion.\nIn the field of bio-inspired robotics, actuation for swimming robots\nusing fin-like propulsion is usually implemented by the use of rotatory\nelectric motors to control the fin swing angle. However, The presence\nof motors hinders miniaturization and integration of actuators into the\nrobot structure, a requirement for flexible machines with deformable body.\nAt the same time this imposes a mechanical conversion of rotations into\noscillatory linear motion, the complexity of which becomes an issue at\nsmaller size. Moreover, minimizing or eliminating the number of moving\nparts required for actuation simplifies maintenance to a large extent. To\ntackle the mentioned difficulties we are directing our research towards new\nways of actuation. Herein we report a simple mathematical model and\nthe numerical analysis of a possible alternative.\nWe start by considering a robot composed of a hull and a fin attached\nto it. The fin is modeled as an elastic beam (see [15] or [6] for more detailed\nmodels), which we want to set into oscillatory motion. In the setup shown\nin Fig. 1, we choose to support the beam at two points. The first support\nis at one edge of the beam and stands for the hull of the robot. The second\nsupport is placed at some intermediate point in the beam. The section\nof the beam beyond this second support is meant to generate the thrust\nby interacting with the surrounding fluid. The actuation is done in the\nsection of the beam between the two supports by means of a combination\nof permanent magnets (one of them attached to the beam) and solenoids.\nIn the configuration chosen, the permanent magnets serve to increase the\ncompliance of the system and to reduce the force that needs to be actively\napplied by the solenoid. The distance between the supports defines the\nrigidity of the actuated section and could be tuned for optimal energy\ntransfer. Similar working principles are described in patents of electric\nrazors, and of active dampers of oscillations for digital cameras lenses\n(in these contexts the actuator is often called motor or electromagnetic\nspring). Similarly, the control of the resonant modes of a structure is\na commonplace problem in structural dynamics [19]. It is noteworthy\nthat all these techniques exploit (to be more efficient) or require (to be\nimplemented) knowledge of the resonant modes of the system under study.\n\n3\n\n\fFigure 1: Schematic of the system described by equations (1). A beam is used\nto model the fin and it is simply supported at two points. The actuation is done\nby means of a combination of permanent magnets and solenoids. The distance\nbetween the supports defines the rigidity of the actuated section.\n\n2\n\nDynamic Model\n\nThe displacement of the magnet in the fin (we will refer to this point as\nthe fin magnet), can be modeled by a spring-mass system under the effect\nof an external force field. Considering only one dimensional motion, the\nsystem is written as,\n\u1e8b = v\nv\u0307 =\n\nK\n\u0393\nF2 (x) + F1 (x) + Fs1 (x) + Fs2 (x)\n\u2212 x \u2212 v,\nm\nm\nm\n\n(1)\n\nwhere x is the displacement of the fin magnet, m is an effective moving\nmass, K represents an effective elastic constant of the fin setup and \u0393 is\nused to include dissipation. The Fi and Fsi terms are forces acting on the\nfin due to the external magnets and the solenoids, respectively.\nMagnetic forces can be highly complex; to keep our model as simple as\npossible we approximate each magnet as a point magnetic dipole, which\nis a good approximation when the distances are significantly bigger than\nthe size of the magnet in the direction of the magnetization [20]. In this\nsituation the force can be expressed as follows,\nFi (x) = \u2212\n\nCi\nsign(x \u2212 xi ),\n(x \u2212 xi )\u03b1\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Ci is a constant that depends on the magnetic moments of the\nmagnets and their geometry, positive values represent attractive forces and\nnegative values repulsive forces. In the case of the solenoids, this constant\ndepend also on the current, i.e. Csi (I) = Csi I(t) (the index s refers to\nsolenoid). The position of the external magnet (or solenoid) measured\nfrom the rest position of fin magnet is xi . Henceforth we define k = K/m,\n\u03b3 = \u0393/m, ci = Ci/m and csi = Csi/m. Additionally, we assume that the\ndeflected fin does not reach the external magnets, in mathematical terms\nthis is expressed as x \u2208 (x1 , x2 ).\nNext we study the dynamics of the system without actuation, I(t) \u2261 0.\nThe expression for the fixed points x\u2217 is obtained by equating system (1)\nto zero. The second equation yields\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\nc2 (x\u2217 \u2212 x1 ) \u2212 c1 (x\u2217 \u2212 x2 ) \u2212 kx\u2217 [(x\u2217 \u2212 x1 ) (x\u2217 \u2212 x2 )] = 0,\n\n4\n\n(3)\n\n\fwhere the assumption x \u2208 (x1 , x2 ) was used to determine the signs.\n\nLinear Stability Analysis. To classify the fixed points, we calculate\nthe trace and determinant of the 2 \u00d7 2 Jacobian matrix J of (1). These\nare given by\nTr(J)\nDet(J)\n\n=\n=\n\n\u2212\u03b3\n\n(4)\n\nk+\u03b1\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\nc1\nc2\n.\n\u2212\n(x \u2212 x2 )\u03b1+1\n(x \u2212 x1 )\u03b1+1\n\n(5)\n\nIn general the fixed points of the system will be saddle-nodes, centers\nor spirals, depending on the value of the parameters \u03b3, k, ci and xi .\nHowever, the position of the fixed point (i.e. the solutions of (3)) are\nindependent of \u03b3.\nTo proceed with the analysis we introduce further assumptions. The\nexponent \u03b1 depends on the arrangement of magnets [20]. Here we will\nconsider identical cylindrical magnets placed symmetrically with respect\nto the rest position of the fin magnet and with dipoles parallel to it (attracting); hence \u03b1 = 4, c1 = c2 = c > 0 and x2 = \u2212x1 = x0 > 0. By\nneglecting dissipation, i.e. \u03b3 = 0, we set the trace of the Jacobian to zero.\nConsequently, the fixed points are either saddle-nodes or centers, depending on the sign of (5). Using these assumptions to simplify the equality\n(3) we obtain,\nh\n\u0001\n\u00014 i\nx\u2217 8cx0 x\u22172 + x20 \u2212 k x\u22172 \u2212 x20\n= 0,\n(6)\n\nrendering evident that x\u2217 = 0 is one of the fixed points, in consequence\nof the symmetry of the problem. The determinant (5) at this point is,\nDet(J)|x\u2217 =0 = k \u2212 8\n\nc\n,\nx50\n\n(7)\n\n5\n\nwhich is positive for c/k < x0/8, and the origin is a center. Although any\nreal system will not show centers without actuation (due to dissipation)\ntheir position will match the pole of the spirals observed.\nIt can be shown that the nonzero solutions of (6) are saddle-nodes.\nDisplacements beyond the saddle-nodes will bring the fin magnet into a\nregion where the attraction is stronger than the elastic restitution, causing\nthe fin to stick to the closest magnet. The saddles establish a natural limit\nfor the maximal amplitude of the orbits of the system. To illustrate these\nideas, we show in Fig. 2 three plots of the polynomial defined by (6)\nfor different values of the ratio c/k, together with phase portraits of the\nsystem. The figure depicts the trade-off between the rigidity of the fin and\nthe interaction of the fin magnet and the permanent magnets. Keeping\nthe x0 fixed, the stronger the magnets (or the more compliant the fin),\nthe smaller the region where the system can present stable orbits. At\n5\nthe critical ratio c/k = x0/8, the saddle-nodes collide at the origin and the\ncenter is transformed into a saddle-node.\n\n3\n\nActuation and Control\n\nAs mentioned before, dissipation will reduce the amplitude of the oscillations. Therefore, to keep the system close to the desired trajectory we need\nto pump energy into it. To do this, we have placed a solenoid surrounding\nboth magnets such that they can increase or decrease the interaction with\n\n5\n\n\fFigure 2: Plot of the polynomial defined in (6) for different values of c/k. The\nstar symbols mark the position of the fixed points. The phase portraits to\nthe right show that the saddle-nodes define a limit for the amplitude of the\norbits. The figure illustrates the trade-off between the rigidity of the fin and\nthe intensity of the magnetic interaction.\nthe fin magnet. Both solenoids are constructed similarly but arranged\nanti-parallel to each other (cs2 = \u2212cs1 = cs > 0). We place them as close\nas possible to the fin magnet, for example near the saddle-nodes of the\nsystem. In order to determine the parameters of the solenoid needed to\ndrive and control the system, we use a simple PID controller which can\nregulate the applied force. To this end, we rearrange the terms of (1) and\nwrite them as,\nc\nc\n\u2212\n+ Fc (t) \u2212 kx \u2212 \u03b3v\n4\n(x \u2212 x0 )\n(x + x0 )4\nZ t\ne(s)ds\nFc (t) = kp e(t) + kd \u0117(t) + ki\n\nv\u0307 =\n\n(8)\n\n0\n\ne(t) = xd (t) \u2212 x(t).\nWhere xd (t) is the desired displacement. The effort required to drive the\nsystem into steady oscillations, depends on the appropriate choice of kp ,\nkd , ki .\n\n4\n\nParameter values\n\nIn the following sections we define the values of the parameters used for\nthe numerical simulation of the platform. We give a brief description on\nthe assumptions and criteria used to select them. In Table 1 we summarize\nthe information.\n\nMagnets. The constant for the force (2) in the case of cylindrical magnets magnetized along their length l is,\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u00012\n3\u03bc0 Br\nC=\n\u03c0R2 l ,\n2\u03c0\n\u03bc0\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03bc0 is the permeability of vacuum, R is the radius of the magnet and\nBr is the remanence of the magnet (a value available from manufacturers).\n\n6\n\n\fThe factors in parenthesis represent the magnetization and the volume of\nthe magnet, they are squared because we are assuming both interacting\nmagnets are equal. Using values from commercially available Neodymium\nmagnets we have calculated C = 2.460 \u00d7 10\u221210 N * m4 .\n\nElastic constant. As can be seen in Fig. 1 we model the fin using\na beam simply supported in two points. The supports are separated by\na distance L. The fin magnet is placed at the point y and the elastic\nstiffness there can be written as,\nK = EJ\n\n3L\n,\ny 2 (L \u2212 y)2\n\n(10)\n\nwhere E is the Young's modulus of the material and J is the second\nmoment of area of the beam. As discussed before, the behavior of the\nsystem depends on the relation between the elastic constant of the fin\nand the strength of the magnets. The current setup allows tuning the\nelasticity of the fin by setting different materials and profiles of the fin,\nor by moving the fin magnet, or by changing the distance between the\nsupports. If needed, the setup could be transformed into a cantilever by\nremoving the second support. To provide good ranges of elasticity we use\nLow-density polyethylene plastic with E \u2248 0.2 \u00d7 109 P a and L = 30mm.\nThe fin has width and thickness of 10mm \u00d7 0.5mm, respectively. The\nfin magnet is placed in the middle of the two supports. This values yield\nK = 37.03N * m\u22121 .\n\nDamping and mass. When a body moves in a liquid, it transfers kinetic energy to the surrounding fluid reducing the acceleration it presents\ncorresponds to the one observed on a body with higher mass. This phenomena, known as added mass, can be estimated using models as the one\npresented in [21]. However, we postpone a detailed description for future\nwork and simply consider a total mass 300 times bigger than the mass of\nthe fin and the magnet together, m = 84.3g. Estimation of the damping\n\u0393 without an experimental setup is not straightforward, therefore we use\ndamping ratios in the range Q \u2208 [0, 0.5]. Where Q = 0 means no damping\nand a value Q = 1 corresponds to critical damping.\nThe table below summarizes the value of the parameters. Though the\nvalues are reasonable, we do not expect them to correspond to any real\ndevice and corrected ones will come from a future validation process.\n\nParameter\nc (C/m)\nk (K/m)\nd (\u03b3/m)\nx0\n\nValue\n2.919 \u00d7 10\u22129\n439.3\n[0, 20.96]\n1 \u00d7 10\u22122\n\nUnits\nN * m4 * kg \u22121\nN * m\u22121 * kg \u22121\nN * s * m\u22121 * kg \u22121\nm\n\nTable 1: The table summarizes the values of the parameters used for the numerical results reported in the text.

We take three initial conditions on the\nregion of the phase space to study. All the initial conditions start with\nzero velocity, i.e. they lay on the horizontal axis. It is important to\nnote that the time series of the fin displacement clearly show different\nfrequencies. This is due to the attraction of the magnets, the higher the\ninitial displacement the lower the frequency of the orbit. These results\nare shown in detail in Fig. 4. For each initial condition we plot the power\nspectrum of the signal and it is visible how the main component decreases\nat higher amplitudes.\n\nFigure 3: Trajectories in phase space and time series for the undamped system starting from three different initial condition. The frequency of the signal\ndecreases with the amplitude due to the interaction of the magnets.\nThe offset of the oscillations corresponds to the position of the center.\nBy breaking the symmetry of the system, either by setting c1 6= c2 or\nby feeding constant current to the solenoids, we can move the center off\nthe origin. This could be required for turning maneuvers or useful for\ninitiating oscillations. In Fig. 5 we show how the center and the saddles\nmove for different values of c1 and c2 (or increasing current).\n\nActuated system. The controller is provided with reference signal\nof the form A cos(wt + \u03c6). The amplitude A is taken inside the bounds\ndefined by the saddle-nodes. Given a value for the amplitude, we use the\ncurve shown in the inset of Fig. 4 as a frequency lookup table. The initial\nphase \u03c6 is calculated from the initial conditions. We took the same initial\nconditions as in the previous section, namely x(0) = A, 0.5 * A, 1.25 * A.\nHowever simple, the control technique shows a remarkable performance as\ncan be appreciated in Fig. 6. In the figure the reference trajectory is the\ndashed line, for the case without damping, the actual trajectories of the\nsystem overlap with. On the left panels the time series of the displacement\nare shown and compared with the reference amplitude.\n\nSolenoid. If we take the maximum of the output from the controller,\nFc (t), and limit the maximum current fed to the solenoids to I \u2264 20mA,\n8\n\n\fFigure 4: Variation of the natural frequency with the amplitude of the oscillations. The power spectrum of the orbits is plotted, the behavior of the main\ncomponent is shown in detail in the inset.\n\nSaddle Point\n\nCenter\n\n4\n3\n\nFixed Points [mm]\n\n2\n1\n0\n\u22121\n\u22122\n\u22123\n\u22124\n\u221220\n\n\u221210\n\n0\n\u2206 c [%]\n\n10\n\n20\n\nFigure 5: Control of the position of the center and saddles. The center moves\nsymmetrically around the origin for differences \u2206c between the magnetic constants. The maximum amplitude is also compromised, because the saddle on\nthe side of the stronger magnet come closer to the center.\nwe can find a suitable expression for calculating the ideal number of turns\nN of a coil. The net force generated on the fin magnet is given by the\nsum of forces due to the 2 coils, the wiring of which ensures that the\nforce generated by each on the fin magnet is additive. This force can be\nexpressed as,\n\u0001\n3\nBr R2 l (N IA) G(xm )\n2\n(xm + x0 )4 + (xm \u2212 x0 )4\nG(xm ) =\n,\n(x2m \u2212 x20 )4\nFm =\n\n9\n\n(11)\n\n\fFigure 6: Trajectory in phase space of the actuated system for three different\ninitial conditions close to the desired amplitude. On Top the results without\ndamping and below them, with damping ratio of Q = 0.5, which gives an\nunfeasible solenoid. In the second case the reference trajectory in phase space\nis shown in dashed line. On the left we show the time series of the displacement\nof the fin.\nwhere Br ,R and l are as in 9, and xm is the displacement corresponding\nto the maximum force Fm . Solving for N and replacing with the corresponding values we get N \u2208 [600, 1000], for Q \u2208 [0, 0.2]. Higher values of\ndamping impose too many turns on the solenoid. Although the model is\nnot yet validated this result is encouraging.\n\n6\n\nDiscussion and conclusion\n\nIn this short report we have presented the first step towards the design and\nconstruction of a novel actuator for small swimming machines. Though\nwe have used rough models, the results show that we are pointing in\nthe right direction. The design shown here is not necessarily the best in\nreducing the actuation needed. For example, one could think of using\nthe instability of the center to initiate motion, by forcing the system\nthrough its bifurcation. This could be achieved by on-line modification of\nthe distance between the supports or by bringing the permanent magnets\ncloser. Additionally, placing a permanent magnet perpendicular to the\nplane at the origin could be used to further reduce the frequency of the\norbits or to control the offset in a more sensitive way than the one shown\nhere.\nOur model includes dissipation proportional to the velocity and therefore the role of dissipation is marginal. More detailed models of the fluid\n\n10\n\n\fdynamics and the bending of the fin will surely bring dissipation into a\nmore primary role in the behavior of the system. In addition, thrust, heat\ndissipation and energy consumption could be estimated in such multiphysics models.\nWe have shown how a simple PID controller could perform reasonably\nwhen information about the phase portrait of the system, like the dependence of frequency with amplitude, is included. The use of adaptable frequency oscillators [17] or standard model-based controllers (like feedback\nlinearization), could improve performance and reduce these requirements.\nAdditionally, a system that is too flexible does not possess orbits without\na controller. Such a controller would requires large amount of actuation,\nsince it is forcing the system to behave unnaturally. Therefore existence\nof orbits can be exploited to reduce energy consumption. This stresses the\nfact that passive dynamics are a key to improve the way we control and\ndesign our robots. Controlling the force between solenoids and moving\nmagnets, brings several challenges on the design of the electrical circuits\ndue to the changes in impedance. Another interesting aspect of the problem that will be addressed in further studies. We understand that results\nobtained solely from simulations are as 'words without actions', however\nthe use of simple models can help us evaluate the feasibility of certain\ndesigns. In our particular case, a device with low friction could be driven\nwith a tuned PID, a frequency lookup table and a solenoid with 800\nturns, consuming about 20mA.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe want to thank our lab coworkers Dr. Max Lungarella, Dr. Hugo\nG.
