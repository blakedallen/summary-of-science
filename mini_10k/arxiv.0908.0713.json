Its characteristic linear dispersion relation where the upper and lower energy bands meet2 has\nled to novel and interesting physics and applications.\nRecent studies3\u20137 have demonstrated the robust and\nreproducible phenomenon of the Josephson effect in devices consisting of two superconducting leads contacted\nby flakes of graphene that are 1-4 layers thick. Clear evidence of multiple Andreev reflections5,6 illustrates that\nsuch graphene junctions behave as SNS junctions. The\ncritical current can be tuned by modulating a backgate voltage3,7 . A dc-SQUID has been constructed using graphene8 , demonstrating several advantages. These\ninclude how graphene is straightforward to fabricate,\nand electrically contact with high-transparency electrodes. The current-phase relation has been predicted9\nand measured10 .\nThe appearance of the Josephson effect in graphene\njunstions motivates us to investigate potential metastable\nquantum states within the washboard potential wells.\nSuch states have been extensively studied in conventional\njunctions for over 25 years and have been used as basis\nstates for superconducting quantum computing11 .\n\nII.\n\nDEVICE FABRICATION AND\nCHARACTERIZATION\n\nTo fabricate devices, we prepare graphene using the\nmechanical exfoliation technique onto Si/SiO2 (300nm)\nsubstrates1 .\nWe first locate and identify single-\n\nlayer and multi-layer graphene specimens using optical\nmicroscopy12. We confirm and characterize the number\nof layers using Raman spectroscopy13 . An example of a\ntypical Raman spectrum that we collect for single-layer\ngraphene is shown in Fig. 1.\n\nFIG. 1: Example Raman spectrum of our single-layer\ngraphene specimens using 514.5 nm laser excitation. The G\npeak at \u223c 1580 cm\u22121 is the E2g optical mode due to in-plane\nlattice vibrations and the 2D peak at \u223c 2700 cm\u22121 is the over\ntone of the D peak due to second-order double resonance13 .\nThe ratio of the peak heights, and the positions of the peaks\nare signatures of the thickness of the graphene flake.\n\nFor device fabrication, we perform no Raman spectroscopy to prevent laser-induced defects in the graphene.\nWe fabricate junctions by depositing, onto the graphene\nflake, Ti (7nm)/Al (80nm) parallel leads, which are separated by 100 nm to 500 nm. The Ti layer provides\ntransparent adhesion to the graphene, and the Al layer is\nsuperconducting below \u223c1 K. Due to the superconduct-\n\n\f2\ning proximity effect3,4 , the areas of graphene underneath\nthe leads become superconducting. We have fabricated\ndevices, an example of which is depicted in Fig. 2(a).\nThis device has a room temperature, 2-probe resistance\nof 5.8 k\u03a9, which is evidence of good electrical contact.\n\ninsulating dielectric, and for suspended graphene, they\nare separated by vacuum. The on-chip shunting capacitor will have an interdigitated design, which will be fabricated with the device leads during a single deposition.\nIII.\n\nTHEORY\n\nThe quantum metastable states we are investigating\nare analogous to those existing within the wells of the\ntilted washboard potential of a current-biased Josephson\njunction22,23 . This potential has the form\n\nU (\u03b3) = \u2212\n\n\u03a60\n(I0 cos (\u03b3) + Ib \u03b3)\n2\u03c0\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the gauge-invariant phase difference, \u03a60 =\nh/2\u03c0 is the flux quantum, I0 is the critical current, and\nIb is the bias current. For a junction with capacitance\nC, this system is analogous to a phase particle of mass\nm = C(\u03a60 /2\u03c0)2 oscillating in a local well with plasma\nfrequency23\n\"\n\n(a)\n\n\u03c9p = \u03c90 1 \u2212\n\n\u0012\n\nIb\nI0\n\n\u00132 # 14\n\n(2)\n\np\nwhere \u03c90 = 2\u03c0I0 /\u03a60 C. At bias current Ib \u223c I0 , the\nenergy spacing between the ground and the first excited\nstates is h\u0304\u03c901 \u2248 h\u0304\u03c9p 23 .\nThe current-phase relationship, the critical current,\nand I0 RN product for ballistic graphene junctions were\ncalculated by Titov and Beenakker24. Specifically, at the\nDirac point, these equations are analytic:\n(b)\n\nFIG. 2: (a) Optical image of one of our fabricated graphene\ndevices that is not suspended. The lead separation is L = 200\nnm and the length of the leads in contact with graphene is\nW = 700 nm. (b) Schematic of our future graphene device\nwith suspended graphene. The graphene and leads are elevated from the substrate only for visual clarity.\n\nCharge carrier mobility in graphene is reduced by substrate induced scatterers, such as charges trapped under\nthe graphene and rippling of the graphene due to the\nroughness of the substrate14 . Removal of the SiO2 substrate should also reduce the effects of anomalous twolevel systems that plague superconducting qubits15\u201317 .\nIn order to achieve ballistic transport in graphene, future devices will consist of suspended graphene, as in Fig.\n2(b)18\u201320 . Suspension of the graphene will be achieved\nby etching the SiO2 with hydrofluoric acid (HF). HF solution is targeted underneath the graphene by capillary\naction21 .\nThe back-gate is provided by the doped Si substrate.\nFor the case of non-suspended graphene, the back-gate\nand graphene are separated by the 300 nm of SiO2 as an\n\ne\u22060 2W\ncos(\u03b3/2)arctanh [sin(\u03b3/2)]\nh\u0304 \u03c0L\ne\u22060 W\n= 1.33\nh\u0304 \u03c0L\n\u22060\n= 2.08\n.\ne\n\nI(\u03b3) =\n\n(3)\n\nI0\n\n(4)\n\nI0 RN\n\n(5)\n\nHere, \u22060 is the superconducting energy gap of the leads,\nW is the length of the leads in contact with the graphene\nflake, and L is the lead separation. These equations were\nderived assuming L \u226a W, \u03be where \u03be = h\u0304v/\u22060 is the\nsuperconducting coherence length, and v is the velocity\nof charge carriers. According to the RCSJ model, the\nequation of motion of the \"phase particle\" is23\n\nIb = I(\u03b3) + C\n\n\u03a60\n\u03a60\n\u03b3\u0308 +\n\u03b3\u0307.\nw\u03c0\n2\u03c0R\n\n(6)\n\nSubstituting (3) in for I(\u03b3) and working backwards, we obtain a washboard potential for a ballistic\nsuperconductor-graphene-superconductor (SGS) junction:\n\n\f3\n\n\u03a60\nU (\u03b3) = \u2212\n2\u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0010 \u0011\u0011i\n\u0010\u03b3 \u0011\n\u0010 \u0010 \u03b3 \u0011\u0011\n\u0010\n2I0 h\n2 \u03b3\n\u2212\n2 sin\narctanh sin\n+ ln 1 \u2212 sin\n+ Ib \u03b3 .\n1.33\n2\n2\n2\n\n(7)\n\nThe SGS potential (7) is plotted alongside the conventional washboard potential (1) in Fig. 3(a). For the same\ncritical current and capacitance, the wells of the SGS potential are shallower. This would result in more closely\nspaced energy levels.\nFrom (7) we calculate the plasma frequency about the\nlocal minimum of the well, \u03b3min , for ballistic graphene\njunctions. This is plotted and compared to (2) in Fig.\n3(b).\n\n\u03c9p\n\n\u0013 12\n2\u03c0I0\n=\n1.33\u03a60 C\n\u0010 \u0010 \u03b3 \u0011\u0011i 12\n\u0011\nh\n\u0010\u03b3\nmin\nmin\ntanh\u22121 sin\n\u00d7 1 \u2212 sin\n. (8)\n2\n2\n\u0012\n\n(a)\n\nThe superconducting gap for bulk Al is \u22060 = 180\n\u03bceV; however, experimentally determined values7 in typical devices ranged from 90 to 120 \u03bceV. Using the approximation \u22060 \u2248 100 \u03bceV, we estimate a critical current of I0 \u2248 100 nA for the device shown in Fig. 2(a)\n(L = 200 nm,W = 700 nm). The intrinsic capacitance\nof the device is small, \u223c 10\u221216 F. Using the estimated\ncritical current and (2) gives fp = \u03c9p /2\u03c0 \u2248 300 GHz, in\nqualitative agreement with experimental results6,8 . We\ncan lower this frequency to fp \u2248 5 GHz by adding a 0.1\npF shunting capacitor.\nIV.\n\nCONCULSION\n\nWe have calculated the washboard potential and\nplasma frequency of SGS junctions. Our calculations\nshow that ballistic graphene junctions are essentially similarly to conventional junctions, with the added benefit\nof a back-gate voltage control of the critical current. We\nare testing this conclusion with a series of experiments\nsuch as current-voltage measurements, microwave resonant activation, and quantum tunneling25 experiments.\nWe will also measure the graphene junctions in both the\nclassical and quantum regimes. The crossover temperature, Tc = h\u0304\u03c9/2\u03c0kB , distinguishes these two regimes26 .\nAt current biasing near the critical current, the estimated\nplasma frequency is 100 GHz, and with a shunting capacitor of 0.1 pF, it is 5 GHz. These plasma frequencies\nhave crossover temperatures of approximately 800 mK\nand 40 mK, respectively. For the higher plasma frequencies, multi-photon processes will be used to enhance the\nescape of the phase particle27 . We will tune these experiments with the back-gate voltage to study this unique\ngraphene/superconductor system.\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 3: (a) Plot of the ballistic graphene junction washboard\npotential biased at ib = Ib /I0 = 0.5 compared to the conventional washboard potential.
