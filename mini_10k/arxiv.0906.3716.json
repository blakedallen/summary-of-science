The\ninclination angle of GX 349+2 is between 40\u25e6 and 47\u25e6 , the emissivity index of the primary emission is between -2.4 and -2, and the\nreflecting plasma extends up to (2-8) \u00d7108 cm.\nConclusions. We compare our results with the twin source Sco X-1 and with the other NS LMXBs showing broad relativistic lines\nin their spectra. We conclude that the blackbody component in the spectrum is the primary emission that hits the inner accretion disk\nproducing the emission lines broadened by relativistic and Doppler effects dominant around the neutron star.\nKey words. line: identification \u2013 line: formation \u2013 stars: individual (GX 349+2) - X-rays: binaries - X-rays: general\n\n1. Introduction\nLow-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) consist of a low-mass star\n(M < 1M\u2299 ) and a neutron star (NS), which generally has a relatively weak magnetic field (B < 1010 G). In these systems, the\nX-ray source is powered by accretion of mass overflowing the\nRoche lobe of the companion star and forming an accretion disk\naround the neutron star. LMXBs containing a neutron star (NS\nLMXBs) are generally divided into Z and Atoll sources, according to the path they describe in an X-ray Color-Color Diagram\n(CD) or hardness-intensity diagram (Hasinger & van der Klis\n1989) assembled by using the source count rate and colors calculated over a typical (usually 2-20 keV) X-ray energy range.\nAtoll sources are usually characterized by relatively low luminosities (0.01-0.2 LEdd ) and often show transient behavior,\nwhile the Z sources in the Galaxy are among the most luminous LMXBs, persistently accreting close to the Eddington limit\n(LEdd ) for a 1.4 M\u2299 NS. The position of an individual source\nin the CD, which determines most of the observed spectral and\ntemporal properties of the source, is thought to be an indicator of\nthe instantaneous mass accretion rate (e.g. Hasinger et al. 1990;\nvan der Klis 1995, for a review). It has been suggested that the\nmass accretion rate (but not necessarily the X-ray luminosity)\nof individual sources increases along the track from the top left\nto the bottom right, i.e. from the islands to the banana branch\nSend offprint requests to: R. Iaria, e-mail: iaria@fisica.unipa.it\n\nin atoll sources and from the horizontal branch (hereafter HB)\nto the normal branch (NB) and to the flaring branch (FB) in Z\nsources.\nGX 349+2, also known as Sco X-2, was called an odd-ball\namong the Z sources (Kuulkers & van der Klis 1998). Similar\nto the case of Sco X-1, GX 349+2 shows a short and underdeveloped HB (if at all). The source variability in the frequency\nrange below 100 Hz is closely correlated with the source position\non the X-ray CD, as in other Z sources. Quasi periodic oscillations at kHz frequencies (kHz QPO) were detected in the NB of\nits Z-track (Zhang, Strohmayer, & Swank 1998). However, GX\n349+2, which sometimes shows broad noise components changing not only with the position in the Z, but also as a function of\nthe position in the hardness-intensity diagram, differs somewhat\nfrom the other Z sources and shows similarities to the behavior seen in bright atoll sources, such as GX 13+1 and GX 3+1\n(Kuulkers & van der Klis 1998; O'Neill et al. 2001, 2002).\nDi Salvo et al. (2001), using BeppoSAX data, showed that\nthe source energy spectrum below 30 keV could be well fit\nby a blackbody (with a temperature of 0.5-0.6 keV) and a\nComptonized component (with seed-photon temperature of 1\nkeV and electron temperature of 2.7 keV). Three discrete features were observed in the spectrum: an emission line at 1.2 keV,\nprobably associated to L-shell Fe xxiv or Ly-\u03b1 Ne x, an emission\nline at 6.7 keV (Fe xxv) and an absorption edge at 8.5 keV, both\ncorresponding to emission from the K-shell of highly-ionized\n\n\f2\n\nR.

(2004), analysing a long BeppoSAX\nobservation, found similar parameters of the the continuum components below 30 keV, detected the presence of emission lines\nassociated to Fe xxiv and Fe xxv, and detected an emission line\nat 2.65 keV associated to S xvi. The long BeppoSAX observation allowed to study changes of the parameters of the Fe xxv\nemission line along the position of the source in the CD from\nthe NB/FB apex to the FB inferring that the equivalent width of\nthe line decrease from 77 eV to 18 eV going from the NB/FB\napex to the FB. The width of the Fe xxv emission line, modelled\nby a Gaussian line, was between 250 and 300 eV.\nRecently Cackett et al. (2008), analysing two Suzaku observations of GX 349+2, modelled the Fe xxv emission line with\na relativistic smeared line (diskline in XSPEC). The authors\nconstrained the energy of the line to be between 6.4 and 6.97\nkeV finding that the line energy was 6.97\u22120.02 keV, associated\nto Fe xxvi and not compatible with a Fe xxv iron line as previously obtained by Iaria et al. (2004) and Di Salvo et al. (2001).\nThe emissivity index, \u03b2, was \u22124.1\u00b10.3, the inner radius in gravitational radii, Rg , was 8.0\u00b10.4, the inclination angle of the source\nwas 23 \u00b1 1 degrees, the equivalent width of the line was 76 \u00b1 6\neV.\nIn this paper we analyse an XMM-Newton observation of\nGX 349+2 finding that the prominent relativistic line is well constrained around 6.7 keV and identified as the resonant transition\nof Fe xxv. In the following we discuss our results and compare\nthem with the recent literature.\n\n2. Observation\nThe XMM-Newton Observatory (Jansen et al. 2001) includes\nthree 1500 cm2 X-ray telescopes each with an European Photon\nImaging Camera (EPIC, 0.1\u201315 keV) at the focus. Two of\nthe EPIC imaging spectrometers use MOS CCDs (Turner et al.\n2001) and one uses pn CCDs (Str\u00fcder et al. 2001). Reflection\nGrating Spectrometers (RGS, 0.35\u20132.5 keV, den Herder et al.\n2001) are located behind two of the telescopes. The region of sky\ncontaining GX 349+2 was observed by XMM-Newton between\n2008 March 19 16:42:41 UT to March 19 22:58:55 UT (OBSid\n\n1600\n\n1700\nC/s [1\u221210 keV]\n\n1800\n\nFig. 2.

Since GX 349+2 is one\nof the brightest X-ray sources, in order to minimize the effects\nof telemetry saturation and pile-up the MOS1 and MOS2 instruments were switched off and the EPIC-pn camera was operated\nin Timing mode with medium filter during the observation. In\nthis mode only one central CCD is read out with a time resolution of 0.03 ms. This provides a one dimensional (4\u2032 .4 wide)\nimage of the source with the second spatial dimension being replaced by timing information. The faster CCD readout results in\na much higher count rate capability of 1500 cts/s before charge\npile-up become a serious problem for point-like sources. The\nEPIC-pn telemetry limit is approximatively 450 c/s for the timing mode1. If the rate is higher, then the counting mode is triggered and part of the science data are lost. This is the case of\nthe observation presented in this work; saturation occurs for a\n55% of the observing time, giving an exposure time of 22.5 ks\nfor RGS1 and RGS2, respectively, and 10 ks for EPIC-pn.\nWe plot the Epic-pn lightcurve in the 1-10 keV energy range\nin Fig. 1 which clearly shows that the count rate is largely variable. To understand whether the variability of the source intensity is energy dependent we extract the lightcurves in the 1-4\nkeV and 4-10 keV energy range, respectively, and plot the hardness ratio [4-10 keV]/[1-4keV] versus the count rate in the 1-10\nkeV energy range in Fig. 2. We find that the spectrum becomes\nharder for a count rate below 1580 c/s corresponding to the time\ninterval between 104 and 1.5 \u00d7 104 s from the start of the observation. Plotting the 1-4 keV, 4-10 keV lightcurve and the [4-10\nkeV]/[1-4keV] hardness ratio versus time (see Fig. 3), it seems\nthat there is no correlation between the 1-4 keV and 4-10 keV\ncount rate. The 1-4 keV count rate is quite constant at 1200 c/s\nbetween 0 and 9 \u00d7 103 s and between 1.5 \u00d7 104 and 2.2 \u00d7 104 s\nfrom the start, and it decreases between 9 \u00d7 103 and 1.5 \u00d7 104 s,\nshowing some flaring activity. The 4-10 keV count rate is quite\nconstant at 530-550 c/s between 0 and 6 \u00d7 103 s and between\n1\nsee Tab. 3 in XMM-Newton Users Handbook published on 15 July\n2008\n\n\fR.

The bin time is 30 s for each lightcurve.\nThe red dot-dashed vertical lines indicate the three selected time\nintervals.\n1.9 \u00d7 104 and 2.25 \u00d7 104 s, while increases to 600 c/s between\n6 \u00d7 103 and 1.9 \u00d7 104 s.\nSince the count rate of the source is variable, we divide the\nlightcurve into three time intervals as indicated in Fig. 3 by the\nred dot-dashed lines. We base our choice on the 4-10 keV count\nrate that is 550 c/s in the first and third time interval and it is\naround 600 c/s in the second time interval. Our choice allows\nto highlight possible changes in the Fe-K\u03b1 region of the spectrum.

Background events were obtained from a box of the same width with RAWX between 2 and\n18.\nThe 0.5-12 keV Epic-pn count rate extracted from the source\nregion is almost 1800 c/s, since the maximum Epic-pn count rate\nshould be 800 c/s to avoid a deteriorated response due to photon\npile-up2, we expect presence of pile-up. We checked the pileup fraction at different energies using the epatplot tool in SAS\nfinding a photon pile-up percentage of 1.3%, 2%, 3.2%, 5.1%,\nTable 2.

The EPIC-pn spectrum has been rebinned not to oversample the energy resolution\nby more than a factor 4 and to have 20 counts per energy channel. The adopted Epic-pn energy range is 0.7-2.1 keV and 2.5-10\nkeV. The spectrum is fitted using XSPEC version 12.3.1\nThe extracted RGS1 spectrum does not show instrumental\nissues and we select data in the 0.6-2 keV energy band for our\nanalysis. The extracted RGS2 spectrum shows calibration problems in CCD 9 and we will not use data from this instrument for\nour analysis. Since we are interested in the study of the Fe-K\u03b1\nregion, in the following we concentrate out spectral analysis on\nthe Epic-pn data, after having checked that the RGS1 spectrum\nwas consistent with the Epic-pn data and does not show more\nfeatures.\nThe continuum emission is fitted adopting the same model\nrecently proposed by Cackett et al. (2008) for the Suzaku spectrum of GX 349+2: i.e. a blackbody component plus a multicolored disk blackbody (DISKBB in XSPEC) both absorbed by\nneutral neutral matter (WABS in XSPEC); because of the narrower energy range of our Epic-pn data (0.7-10 keV) with respect to the Suzaku data we did not add to the model a powerlaw component necessary to fit the Suzaku data above 10 keV.\nWe obtained a reduced \u03c72red = 7.73 with 282 degree of freedom (d.o.f.). The residuals, plotted in Fig. 5, suggest the presence of broad emission lines at 1, 2.7, 3.35, 3.9 keV and, finally\na broader emission line between 6 and 7 keV. Initially, we added\n\nNote - Best-fit values of the parameters obtained for the averaged spectrum fitting the emission features with Gaussian profiles.\nUncertainties are at the 90% confidence level for a single parameter. The\nparameters are defined as in XSPEC. The continuum emission is fitted\nwith a blackbody plus a multicolored disk blackbody, diskbb. The\nfour broad emission features are modelled adopting Gaussian components. All components are subject to interstellar absorption.\n\nthe CCD finding that the photon pile-up fraction did not change\nsignificantly; we obtained a photon pile-up percentage of 1.1%,\n1.7%, 3.1%, 4.7%, 6.7%, and 9.2% at 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10\nkeV, respectively. Finally, excluding the two brightest columns\nat RAWX= 37 and RAWX= 38, we found a photon pile-up fraction of 0.2%, 0.6%, 1.6%, 1.9%, 4.8%, and 6.5% at 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,\nand 10 keV, respectively. In this case the 0.5-12 keV Epic-pn\ncount rate is 920 c/s. The photon pile-up percentage values with\nthe associated errors are reported in Tab. 2 and the plot of the\nfraction patterns of single and double events are shown in Fig.\n4. After this investigation we choose to extract the Epic-pn spectrum excluding the two brightest columns at RAWX= 37 and\nRAWX= 38 from the source region to avoid any doubt on the\nvalidity of our analysis.\nSince the high available statistics the EPIC-pn spectrum\nshows evident calibration issues between 2 and 2.5 keV due to\nthe Au edge near 2.3 keV, we excluded the EPIC-pn data be-\n\nFig. 5.

Since\nthe line around 2.7 keV is near the hole in the Epic-pn data, we\nfixed the energy of the line at 2.62 keV, imposing that it is associated to the Ly-\u03b1 S xvi transition, furthermore we fixed its\nwidth at 140 eV. We obtain a \u03c72red (d.o. f.) = 1.51(269) and a \u03c72\nimprovement of \u2206\u03c72 = 1775.

The centroid of the broader line\nbetween 6 and 7 keV is not identifiable because we find a line\ncentered at 6.80\u00b10.02 keV. We also note that, while the FWHMs\nof the broad lines below 6 keV are between 0.2 and 0.4 keV, the\nbroader line in the Fe-K\u03b1 region has a FWHM of 0.6\u20130.7 keV\n(the line profile is visible in the residuals shown in Fig. 6).\nWe have also investigated the possibility that the Fe-K\u03b1 feature is a blending of lines. We fitted the broad Fe-K\u03b1 emission\nfeature as a blending of Fe xxv (6.7 keV) and Fe xxvi (6.97 keV)\nemission lines adopting two Gaussian profiles and fixing their\nenergies at the expected rest-frame values; the values of the fit\nare reported in Tabs. 3 (column 3) and 4 (column 3). Even in this\ncase the Fe xxv and Fe xxvi emission lines appear to be broad,\nhaving widths of 200 eV (FWHM=0.5 keV).\nUnder the hypothesis that the broadening of the lines is produced by the relativistic motion of the emitting plasma in the\naccretion disk close to the neutron star, we fit the line profiles\nat 2.62, 3.32, 3.90, and 6.80 keV with relativistic disk line components (DISKLINE in XSPEC). Assuming that the emission\nfeatures are produced in the same region, we impose that the\ninner radius, the outer radius, the emissivity index, and the inclination angle of the system are the same for all these components.\nAdding these components to the continuum emission we find a\nslightly better fit, \u03c72red (d.o. f.) = 1.47(268).\nWe find that the emissivity index of the accretion disk is\n\u22122.1, the inner radius is less than 25 gravitational radii (GM/c2 ,\nhereafter Rg ), corresponding to 52 km for a NS mass of 1.4 M\u2299 ,\nand the inclination angle of the system is 41\u25e6 . The best-fit values\nof the parameters are reported in Tab. 5 (column 2); we plot data\nand residuals in the 0.7-10 keV energy band and the corresponding unfolded spectrum in the Fe-K\u03b1 region in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8,\nrespectively.\nThe Fe-K\u03b1 line has an energy of 6.76 \u00b1 0.02 keV and it is\nnot compatible (at 90% confidence level) with the rest-frame\nvalue of Fe xxv transition (6.7 keV). We therefore tried to fit\nthe Fe-K\u03b1 broad feature adopting two diskline components associated to Fe xxv and Fe xxvi transitions. We fixed the energy\n\nFig. 7.

We find an emissivity\nindex of \u22122.2 \u00b1 0.2, an inner radius less than 26 Rg , corresponding to 52 km for a NS mass of 1.4 M\u2299 , and an inclination angle\nof the system of 43+4\n\u22123 deg.\nThe extrapolated absorbed and unabsorbed flux in the 0.1100 keV energy range was 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22128 and 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22128 erg cm\u22122\ns\u22121 , respectively. We obtain an equivalent hydrogen column\ndensity of 0.74 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 ; the same value was obtained by\nChristian & Swank (1997) using the Einstein solid-state spectrometer (SSS; 0.5-4.5 keV), estimating a distance to the source\nof 5 \u00b1 1.5 kpc (hereafter we will use this distance).

Spectral analysis of the selected time intervals\n\nTo study possible changes of the broad emission line in the FeK\u03b1 region of the XMM spectrum of GX 349+2 we extracted the\nEPIC-pn spectrum from the interval 2 (Spectrum 2) and from\nthe intervals 1 and 3 together (Spectrum 1+3). Since the 4-10\nkeV lightcurve (Fig. 3, middle panel) indicates a higher count\nrate in the time interval 2 than in the time intervals 1 and 3,\nwe expect a harder spectrum corresponding to the time interval\n2. The lower statistics in the time selected spectra, due to the\nlower exposure times, requires that we fix some parameters of\nthe diskline components. We fixed the outer radius and the inclination angle of the system to the values obtained fitting the\nspectrum corresponding to the whole observation. Initially we\nadopted only a diskline component to fit the Fe-K\u03b1 broad fea-\n\n\u03c72red (d.o. f.)\nNote - See Tab. 5.\n\nture obtaining an energy value of 6.74\u00b10.04 and 6.78\u00b10.03 keV\ncorresponding to Spectrum 1+3 and 2, respectively. We note that\nwhile the line energy is compatible with a Fe xxv transition for\nSpectrum 1+3, it is not for Spectrum 2, that is when the count\nrate in the 4-10 keV energy band increases. The best-fit values\nare reported in Tab. 5 (column 3 and 4).\nAs a consequence of this result we fitted the Fe-K\u03b1 broad\nfeature in Spectra 2 and 1+3 adopting two diskline components\nwith energies fixed at 6.7 and 6.97 keV. Also in this case we\nfixed the outer radius and the inclination angle of the system\nto the values obtained fitting the average spectrum. The best-fit\nvalues are reported in Tab. 6 (column 3 and 4). We find that the\nmain differences between Spectrum 1+3 and Spectrum 2 is the\nvalue of the blackbody normalization that is larger in Spectrum\n2. Also we note that the flux of the line at 1 keV, the S xvi line, the\n\n\fR. Iaria et al.: A ionized reflecting skin in GX 349+2\n\nFig. 8. Unfolded spectrum in the energy range 5.5-7.7 keV; the\nFe xxv relativistic line profile is shown.\nAr xviii line, the Ca xix line, and Fe xxv line is lower in Spectrum\n2 than Spectrum 1+3 while the flux of the Fe xxvi line is larger\nin Spectrum 2 than Spectrum 1+3. In the following section we\ndiscuss all these results.\n\n3. Discussion\nWe performed a spectral analysis of a 22.5 ks XMM observation of GX 349+2 in the 0.7-10 keV energy range. The large\nflux from the source caused a telemetry overflow in the EPIC-pn\ndata collection, resulting an effective exposure time of 10 ks. We\nfit the continuum emission adopting a blackbody plus a multicolored disk blackbody and both these components are absorbed\nby neutral matter. Five emission features were clearly visible in\nthe spectrum.\nInitially we fitted these features using Gaussian profiles and\nfinding their energies at 1.05, 2.62 (fixed), 3.32, 3.9, and 6.8 keV.\nThe corresponding widths and equivalent width were 90, 140\n(fixed), 190, 100, and 280 eV, respectively, and 22, 6, 12, 9 and\n49 eV, respectively. We associated the first four lines to L-shell\nFe xxii-xxiii transition, Ly-\u03b1 S xvi, Ly-\u03b1 Ar xviii, and Ca xix resonance transition, respectively. The broader emission feature in\nthe Fe-K\u03b1 region was not identifiable, hence we supposed that\nit is a blending of Fe xxv and Fe xxvi emission lines. Fitting the\nbroad feature adopting two Gaussian profiles centered at 6.7 and\n6.97 keV we obtained that their corresponding widths were 220\nand 280 eV. We conclude that if the Fe-k\u03b1 feature is a blending\nof Fe xxv and Fe xxvi emission lines, these lines are intrinsically\nbroad.\nBeppoSAX observed three emission lines in the spectrum\nof GX 349+2 (Iaria et al. 2004; Di Salvo et al. 2001): the first\none centered at 1.18 \u00b1 0.03 keV, interpreted as L-shell Fe xxiv\ntransition, the second at 2.60\u00b10.06 keV, interpreted as Ly-\u03b1 S xvi\ntransition and, finally, the third at 6.75 \u00b1 0.01 keV, interpreted as\nFe xxv transition. In this observation we find that the centroid of\nthe broad emission line at 1 keV is at a lower energy suggesting\na L-shell transition of less ionized iron (Fe xxii-xxiii) although\nwe cannot exclude a more complex blending of Fe xxi-xxiv. The\nwidths and equivalent widths of these three lines are very similar\ncomparing our observation and the two BeppoSAX observations\nof GX 349+2 (Iaria et al. 2004; Di Salvo et al. 2001) in the non-\n\n7\n\nflaring state. Iaria et al. (2004) found, during interval 2 in the\nnon-flaring state, widths of < 80, < 120 and 210 \u00b1 80 eV, and\nequivalent widths of 23 \u00b1 8, 7+4\n\u22121 , and 52 \u00b1 11 eV corresponding\nto the Fe xxiv, S xvi, and Fe xxv emission lines. Furthermore,\nDi Salvo et al. (2001) obtained equivalent widths for the Fe-K\u03b1\nline of 71 eV and 34 eV, in the non-flaring and flaring state of\nthe source, respectively. From these rough comparisons it seems\nthat the source is in a non-flaring state during the observation\ndiscussed in this work, although we cannot assert this conclusion\nwithout an accurate analysis of the time variabilities.\nThese emission features can be fitted slightly better adopting smeared relativistic lines. The large widths of the lines\nsuggest that these are produced by reflection of the primary\nspectral component by the accretion disk. Similar broad emission features, discussed as smeared lines were recently observed in several systems containing a neutron star, such as\nSer X-1 (Bhattacharyya & Strohmayer 2007), SAX J1808.43658 (Papitto et al. 2009; Cackett et al. 2009a), 4U 1705-44\n(Di Salvo et al. 2005, 2009), GX 340+0 (D'A\u0131\u0300 et al. 2009), 4U\n1636-536 (Pandel et al. 2008), X 1624-490 (Iaria et al. 2007),\nand 4U 1820-30 and GX 349+2 (Cackett et al. 2008), and authors of these papers agree to interpret the broadening as due\nto relativistic and Doppler effects. In the following we show the\nself-consistency of the disk reflection scenario discussing the parameters reported in Tab. 6.\nWe infer the inner radius of the accretion disk, Rdisk , using\nthe normalization value of the multicolored disk blackbody and\nthe inclination angle of the source, i = 43+4\n\u22123 deg, obtained by the\nrelativistic smeared line, finding that Rdisk is 8\u00b13 and 8\u00b12 km for\nSpectrum 1+3 and 2, respectively. . The blackbody radius, RBB,\ninferred by the best-fit values of the blackbody normalization is\n4.2 \u00b1 1.4 and 4.5 \u00b1 1.4 km for Spectrum 1+3 and 2, respectively,\ntoo small to be associated to the X-ray emission from the NS\nsurface.\nTaking into account possible modifications of the multicolored disk blackbody component due to electron scattering\n(Shakura & Syunyaev 1973; White et al. 1988), the measured\ncolor temperature, T col , is related to the effective temperature of\nthe inner disk, T col = f T e f f , where f is the spectral hardening\nfactor, and Re f f = f 2 Rmeasured . Adopting f = 1.7 as estimated\nby Shimura & Takahara (1995) for a luminosity around 10% of\nthe Eddington limit, close to the 25% of the Eddington limit estimated for GX 349+2 in our analysis, the corrected value of Rdisk\nis 24 \u00b1 7 km. The radius of the accretion disk is compatible with\nthe value of the inner radius obtained by the relativistic smeared\nlines, that is, assuming a neutron star mass of 1.4 M\u2299 , < 41 km\nand 19+41\n\u22126 km, for Spectrum 1+3 and 2, respectively. In the same\nway, correcting the radius of the blackbody component for the\nelectron scattering, we infer that RBB = 13 \u00b1 4 km. This radius\nis compatible with the NS radius and suggests that the blackbody component is produced very close the NS surface. In this\nscenario we directly observe the emission from inside the inner\nradius of the accretion disk, that is close the NS surface, and the\nblackbody component is interpreted as the direct emission from\na compact corona and/or a boundary layer (BL) located between\nthe neutron star and the inner radius of the disk. We should expect a Comptonized emission from the compact corona and/or\nBL, but if it is optically thick the Comptonized component results saturated and mimics a blackbody emission in the adopted\nenergy range.\nWe observe, for the first time, reflection from the inner accretion disk that involves not only the K-transitions of iron but also\nions of lighter elements as Sulfur, Argon and Calcium which all\ncorrespond to a similar ionization parameter. We observe emis-\n\n\f8\n\nR. Iaria et al.: A ionized reflecting skin in GX 349+2\n\nsion lines associated to S xvi, Ar xviii, Ca xix, and Fe xxv, which\ncorrespond to a ionization parameter Log(\u03be) \u2243 3. A similar detection was recently reported by Di Salvo et al. (2009) analysing\nXMM data of 4U 1705\u201344.\nUsing the relation \u03be = L x /(ner2 ), where L x is the unabsorbed luminosity in the 0.1-100 keV, ne the electron density of\nthe plasma, and r the distance from the source of the emitting\nplasma we can roughly estimate the electron density ne adopting\nas distance from the source the inner and outer accretion disk\nradius, Rin and Rout , obtained from the diskline components. We\nobtain that the electron density ne decreases from 1022 to 1017\ncm\u22123 going from the inner to the outer radius. These values of\nelectron densities are in agreement with the values reported by\nVrtilek et al. (1993), who estimated the electron density of an\nextended cloud to be 1022 cm\u22123 near the equatorial plane at a\ndistance from the neutron star surface lower than 108 cm (see\nFig. 2 in Vrtilek et al. 1993).\nFrom the analysis of the two selected spectra we find that\nthe extrapolated (not absorbed) flux in the 0.1\u2013100 keV band\nof the multicolored disk blackbody is approximatively constant:\n(0.61 \u00b1 0.12) \u00d7 10\u22128 and (0.49 \u00b1 0.05) \u00d7 10\u22128 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 for\nSpectrum 1+3 and 2, respectively. The blackbody component\nhas a larger flux in Spectrum 2 (0.94 \u00b1 0.03 \u00d7 10\u22128 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 )\nthan in Spectrum 1+3 (0.77\u00b10.02\u00d710\u22128 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ). This suggests that the intensity change during the observation is driven by\nthe blackbody component. In our scenario the blackbody component is associated to the emission from a BL around the compact\nobject and this emission illuminates the surface of the inner accretion disk producing the reflection lines observed in the spectra. We note that the line fluxes are larger in Spectrum 1+3 than\nin Spectrum 2 except for the flux associated to the Fe xxvi line\nwhich shows an anticorrelated behaviour.\nOur scenario may easily explain these results: in fact, if the\nemission from the BL increases, the flux illuminating the accretion disk increases, then the ionization parameter of the reflecting matter also increases under the hypothesis that the density of the matter does not change. This implies that transitions\nof heavier ions are more probable, since lighter ions as S xvi,\nAr xviii, Ca xix, and Fe xxv decrease in number while heavier\nions as Fe xxvi increase in number, giving as results a larger flux\nof the Fe xxvi line and a lower flux of the other lines.\nGX 349+2 is a NS LMXBs belonging to the Z-class sources\nand its behaviour is very similar to the prototype of its class\nSco X-1. Steeghs & Casares (2002) analysed the optical spectrum of Sco X-1 and obtained a firm mass ratio limit of q <\n\u223c 0.61\nfrom the phase-resolved spectroscopy, where q is the ratio of\nthe companion star mass to the neutron star mass. If we assume\nthat the optical periodicity of 21.9 \u00b1 0.4 hours, observed in GX\n349+2 by Wachter & Margon (1996), is the orbital period of the\nsystem, the mass function of GX 349+2 is f (M) = 0.032 M\u2299\n(see Wachter & Margon 1996). We find that the inclination angle of the system is 43+4\n\u22123 deg. Assuming a neutron star mass\nof 1.4 M\u2299 we find q \u223c 0.56, a value very similar to the upper\nlimit estimated for Sco X-1, giving a mass of the companion star\nof Mc = 0.78+0.07\n\u22120.06 M\u2299 , typical for a NS LMXB of the Z class\n(q \u2264 0.61 for Sco X-1, Steeghs & Casares 2002; q = 0.34 \u00b1 0.04\nfor Cyg X-2, Casares et al. 1997).\nFurthermore Sco X-1 shows twin compact radio lobes forming an angle, with respect the line of sight, of 44\u00b16 deg (error at 1\n\u03c3, see Fomalont et al. 2001). If the jet from the source producing\nthe radio lobes is almost perpendicular to the equatorial plane of\nthe system then the angle of 44\u00b16 deg corresponds to the inclination angle of the system, similar to the inclination angle of 43+4\n\u22123\ndeg obtained for GX 349+2 in this work. Our results indicate that\n\nSco X-1 and GX 349+2 are very similar sources, as already suggested by other authors (see e.g. Kuulkers & van der Klis 1998).\nAlthough our scenario looks reasonable, our values of the\ndiskline parameters are not compatible with the recent ones reported by Cackett et al. (2008). Cackett et al. analysing Suzaku\ndata of GX 349+2 fitted the broad emission feature in the FeK\u03b1 region adopting a smeared relativistic line with the outer radius fixed at 1000 Rg . They found a line energy associated to\nFe xxvi, an inner radius of 16.5 \u00b1 0.8 km, an emissivity index\nof \u22124.1 \u00b1 0.3 and, finally, an inclination angle of the system of\n23\u25e6 \u00b1 1\u25e6 . The differences in line energy, emissivity index, and\ninner radius of the reflecting skin could be explained supposing that GX 349+2 was observed in a different spectral state.\nWe find that the Fe-K\u03b1 broad emission feature is associated to\nFe xxv line or to a blending of Fe xxv and Fe xxvi in which the\nFe xxv line is more intense. Our measurement is similar to the\nprevious BeppoSAX observations of GX 349+2 (Di Salvo et al.\n2001; Iaria et al. 2004) and to the two recent Chandra observations of this source (Cackett et al. 2009b). In all these observations GX 349+2 was in NB/FB and/or in the bottom part of the\nFB. The only exception is the Suzaku observation of GX 349+2\n(Cackett et al. 2008) where the broad emission line seems associated to Fe xxvi suggesting that the source was in a different\nstate; in fact, as discussed by Cackett et al., it is possible that GX\n349+2 was in NB during that observation.\nHowever, the different inclination angles of the system obtained in this work and by Cackett et al. (2008) cannot be easily\nexplained since the inclination angle of the system should not\ndepend on the state of the source and should not change. Using\nthe inclination angle obtained by Cackett et al. we obtain a mass\nratio q \u223c 1.25 and a companion star mass of 1.74+0.12\n\u22120.11 M\u2299 for\na neutron star mass of 1.4 M\u2299 , that is quite unusual for a NS\nLMXBs.\nHigher statistics spectroscopic studies are needed to put\ntighter constraints on the system parameters of this source, since\nthese can give important informations on the whole binary system and on the physics of the accretion flow close to the compact\nobject.\n\n4. Conclusions\nWe analysed a XMM observation of GX 349+2 finding the presence of prominent emission features associated to S xvi, Ar xviii,\nCa xix, Fe xxv and, possibly, Fe xxvi. The emission features can\nbe fitted with relativistic smeared lines (diskline). The continuum emission was fitted adopting a multicolored disk blackbody\nplus a blackbody component. We investigated the scenario in\nwhich the broad emission lines are formed by reflection from a\nionized skin in the inner region of the accretion disk illuminated\nby the emission of a compact corona (or a boundary layer) surrounding the neutron star that we fitted with a blackbody component with a temperature of 1.8 keV. We find a self-consistent\nexplanation of our results. The inner radius of the disk blackbody is 24 \u00b1 7 km while the broad lines give an inner disk radius\nless than 40 km from the neutron star center. We discuss that\nthe electron density of the reflecting plasma is between 1017 and\n1022 cm\u22123 and that the inclination angle of the source is around\n43\u25e6 . Finally, we infer that, for an inclination angle of 43\u25e6 , the\nmass of the companion star is 0.78 M\u2299 .\nAcknowledgements.
