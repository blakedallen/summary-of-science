Techniques: interferometers - Stars: chemically peculiar - binaries: general\n\n1. Introduction\nThe limitations imposed by the atmospheric seeing is a serious problem for ground based observations. Speckle interferometry, which allows one to circumvent blurring by\nthe Earth's atmosphere, has been known for three decades\n(Labeyrie 1970) and is mainly applied to the research of\nclose binary and multiple systems (see the large series of\npapers by McAlister and collaborators), to the measurements of stellar diameters and to the study of the strucure\nof circumstellar envelopes at different wavelengths; it has\nbeen also used to evaluate sizes and shapes of the minor\nobjects of the solar system. Unfortunately, this technique\nhas not been widely applied so far since its major limitation lies in the relatively small dynamic range allowed\nfor the object magnitude. However, speckle interferometry, under certain observing conditions, can still be used\nto retrieve the difference in magnitude between objects\nwhich are quite close in terms of relative brightness.\nIn spectral analysis, the flux from a composite object,\nwhen interpreted as due to a single source, will most cerSend offprint requests to: E. Marchetti\n\u22c6\nBased on observations made with the Italian Telescopio\nNazionale Galileo (TNG) operated on the island of La Palma\nby the Centro Galileo Galilei of the CNAA (Consorzio\nNazionale per l'Astronomia e l'Astrofisica) at the Spanish\nObservatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the Instituto de\nAstrofisica de Canarias\nCorrespondence to: emarchet@eso.org\n\ntainly cause confusion and may originate elaborate, but\nunrealistic, theories. Such a confusing situation is evident\nin the class of the \u03bb Boo stars, Population I, early-A, recently extended up to early-F type stars characterized by\nmetal lines much weaker than expected for their spectral type. The wide range of the derived metal underabundances and the variety of explanations of the \u03bb Boo\nphenomenon are found in the large number of recent papers on the identification and interpretation of these stars.\nFaraggiana & Bonifacio (1999) raised the question that\nundetected duplicity is a possible explanation of the peculiar Balmer profiles (shallow cores and broad wings) and\nof the apparent metal underabundances of several \u03bb Boo\ncandidates; in fact, in a composite spectrum, the veiling\neffect produces shallow lines which are characteristic of\nmost \u03bb Boo stars (see Corbally 1987).\n\n2. Observations\nThe speckle camera mounted on the Adaptive Optics\nmodule (AdOpt@TNG) of the 3.5m Telescopio Nazionale\nGalileo (TNG) is expected to reach the diffraction limit\n(0.\u2032\u2032 043 at 600nm) and is an ideal tool for separating narrow binary systems with magnitude differences between\ntheir components of less than 3 magnitudes, as is expected\nin the case of binarity of a \u03bb Boo candidate.\nThe imager is an ICCD Proxitronic camera with a\nquantum efficiency optimized for the blue part of the visible spectrum (\u2248 20% at 500nm). The central part of the\n\n\f2\n\nMarchetti et al.: TNG speckle observations of \u03bb Boo stars\n\nTV signal is digitized in a 128\u00d7128 pixel array (8 bits/px)\nat the standard frame rate of 25 Hz, while the single frame\nexposure ranges from 2 to 40ms. An optical relay provides\na scale of \u2248 0.\u2032\u2032 030/px giving a field of view of \u22483.\u2032\u2032 9. No\natmospheric dispersion correction is applied.\nThe speckle camera computes in real\u2013time the power\nspectrum of each frame and sums directly the whole set\nof power spectra obtained during the run. The data are\nthen off\u2013line corrected for the instrumental biases such\nas the background and detector inhomogeneities. The filter set includes some general purpose (Str\u00f6mgren bands)\nand some narrow bandpass ones (e.g. H\u03b1 or TiO and ZrO\nabsorption bands).\nA detailed description of the real\u2013time speckle facility can be found in Marchetti et al. (1997) and Mallucci\n(1998), while the real\u2013time data acquisition is fully described in Baruffolo, Ragazzoni & Farinato (1998).\nA calibration run of the speckle camera of the TNG has\nbeen used to observe a sample of stars classified as \u03bb Boo\nfrom spectroscopic observations; this sample has been extracted from the list published by Faraggiana & Bonifacio\n(1999) and it is shown in Table 4. We obtained speckle observations of these stars on the nights of December 20th\nand 21st, 1999 and on September 28th, 2000. The nights\nwere plagued by poor seeing and as a consequence the signal to noise ratio (SNR) for most observations was not\nhigh enough to provide stringent lower limits for separation and \u2206m. We report here the positive results obtained\nfor two stars, HD 38545 and HD 290492, for which we\nmeasured separation, \u2206m and position angle, and we give\nthe upper limits we could attain for some other \u03bb Boo\ncandidates.\nThe filters chosen for the observation were tuned to\nmatch both the characteristics of the objects and the seeing conditions experienced during the two nights. We decided to use the intermediate band filters b and y of the\nStr\u00f6mgren system and a narrow band H\u03b1 filter for the\nvery bright star HD 38545.\nThe exposure time of each speckle frame was 20 ms\nfor all stars observed, including those used for the field of\nview calibration, and runs of 3000 frames were performed,\neach with a total integration time of 60 seconds per run.\nDepending on seeing conditions and on the brightness of\nthe target star, up to 10 runs per object were performed.\nFor each object, we selected a reference single star\nin order to acquire the Speckle Transfer Function (STF)\nneeded to deconvolve the atmospheric disturbance from\nthe power spectrum of the object. Since the behaviour of\nthe seeing is variable with a time scale that may be of the\norder of minutes, and also depends on the zenith distance,\nwe selected a suitable STF star of comparable magnitude\nwithin few degrees of each target, and we switched between them many times, thus allowing the best possible\nhomogeneity in terms of temporal seeing variations.\nWe also selected two double stars having well\u2013known\norbital parameters for determining the detector's scale and\norientation, namely ADS784 AB and ADS6650 AB, for\nwhich the orbital parameters are taken from Cole et al.\n\nFig. 1. Autocorrelation function of HD 38545\n(1992) and S\u00f6derhjelm (1999) respectively and which were\nobserved with all the three filters mentioned above.\n\n3. Data Reduction\nThe speckle facility, after the end of each run, provides\nthe accumulated power spectrum of the collected speckle\nframes. The power spectrum is divided by the STF obtained from observations of a nearby star, canceling out\nin this way the contribution of the atmospheric turbulence affecting the observation. This image pre\u2013processing\nis also needed both for removing some features caused by\nthe possible repetitive noise induced on the camera signal\nand to eliminate a typical cross\u2013shaped disturbance occurring when the speckle image of the object is not entirely\ncontained in the camera field of view. The power spectrum is then inverted via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT),\nand the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the brightness\ndistribution of the astronomical target is obtained. In the\ncase of binary stars, the ACF shows the characteristic behaviour of a central peak with two opposite and symmetric secondary peaks (see Fig.1). The distance between the\ncentral peak and one of the secondary ones is the separation between the two components while the position angle\nis given by the orientation of the secondary peak with 180\u25e6\nuncertainty. The center of the secondary peaks is retrieved\nby fitting a paraboloid with a sub\u2013pixel precision.\nThe magnitude difference is estimated by comparing\nthe intensities of the secondary and the central peaks.\nThe energy contained in the two secondary peaks is computed by integrating the ACF signal delimited by the\nparaboloidal fitting, and the same procedure is applied to\n\n\fMarchetti et al.: TNG speckle observations of \u03bb Boo stars\n\n3\n\nTable 1.

The\ncentral pixel of the ACF is affected by a large amount\nof spurious signal given by the correlation of the noise\nand the background. In the integration process, its value\nhas been substituted with that estimated by the fitted\nparaboloid at the same position. Finally, the comparison between the energies of the secondary peaks and\nthat of the central one gives the magnitude difference.\nThe relative errors are computed using the errors of the\nparaboloidal fitting.\nThe unfavourable weather conditions (poor seeing and\nstrong wind) during the observations seriously affected the\ninstrument performance. Even if the speckle interferometry is not as sensible to the seeing as other high angular\nresolution techniques (i.e. Adaptive Optics), the low SNR\nachieved surely compromised both the possibilty to detect very close binary systems (separation < 0.\u2032\u2032 1), and\nthe accuracy of the magnitude difference measurements.\nHowever, the obtained data are quite encouraging and\ndemonstrate that also when seeing conditions are not the\nmost favourable for high angular resolution observations,\nit is still possible to attain significant results.\n\n4. Results for HD 38545\nThis star (=HR 1989 =131 Tau) was classified as \u03bb Boo\nby Gray & Garrison (1987) and, since then, it has been\naccepted as belonging to this class by all authors, except\nfor Abt & Morrell (1995) who classified it as a shell star.\nThe observed spectrum mimics quite well that of\na single star, as shown by the abundance analysis by\nSt\u00fcrenburg (1993) and by the line profile discussion by\nBohlender & Walker (1994), who confirm the atmospheric\nparameters, Teff and log g derived by the former author.\nThe star's shell lines are discussed by Bohlender & Walker\n(1994), Andrillat et al. (1995), Grady et al. (1996), Hauck\net al. (1998), Holweger et al. (1999), but none of these\nauthors could find any spectroscopic signature suggesting\nthat the star is not a single object.\nSince this star is quite bright (V = 5.725) it was observed with 3 filters: H\u03b1 , y an b. Our results are given in\nTable 1 and the autocorrelation function is shown in Fig.1.\nThere is good agreement between the present results and\nthose obtained by the Hipparcos experiment (separation\n0.\u2032\u2032 155, \u2206Hp = 0.64).\nThe duplicity of HD 38545 was discovered using\nspeckle interferometry by McAlister et al. (1993) and measured again by Hartkopf et al. (2000). Of the 4 above\nmeasurements of the CHARA group, the separations in\nthree cases are quite close together (\u22480.\u2032\u2032 170 in 1995.7686,\n\nFig. 2. Interferometric measurements of HD38545 fitted\nwith a sinusoid: the empty circles are the CHARA data\nand the filled circle is our y measurement. The fitting is\nmade under the assumption i = 90\u25e6 and e = 0\n1996.8717 and 1997.1311), while the separation measured\nby McAlister et al. (1993) in 1988.1729 is 0.\u2032\u2032 071, i.e. over\na factor of two smaller than the others. The position angles measured by the CHARA group are all close to 190\u25e6\nand slightly decreasing, as in our case, and this fact suggests that the orbit is seen nearly edge\u2013on. Although the\namount of data is too small to retrieve the orbital parameter of this binary, a rough estimation of the orbital period\ncan be made in the approximate assumption that the inclination is i = 90\u25e6 and the orbit is circular (e = 0). We\nfitted the separations vs. the epoch of the interferometric\nobservations with a sinusoid and we found a good agreement for P = 43.5y and a =0.\u2032\u2032 171 (see Fig.2). Using the\nHipparcos parallax from Table 4 we give an estimation for\nthe total mass of the system M = 5.7 \u00b1 2.3 M\u2299 .\nAccording to the spectral analysis by St\u00fcrenburg\n(1993), the two components are expected to have similar masses of about 2.5 M\u2299 . In fact, the absolute magnitude of this object corresponds to that of a star lying\nmore than one magnitude above the ZAMS if the duplicity is not taken into account, and therefore its position on\nthe HR diagram given by Paunzen (1997), Paunzen et al.\n(1998) (who also computed a wrong value of MV ) and, on\nthe colour-magnitude diagram, by Bohlender et al. (1999)\nis misleading.\n\n5. Results for HD 290492\nThe characteristics of this binary system reported in the\nWashington Double Star (WDS) catalogue are \u2206m = 1.4\nand d=0.\u2032\u2032 6, while medium-resolution spectroscopic observations allowed Paunzen & Gray (1997) to resolve the system; in fact they claim to have measured \u2206m = 0.9 and\na separation of 2\u2032\u2032 . The data of the WDS catalogue are\nbased on 3 visual observations made by R.A. Rossiter at\n\n\f4\n\nMarchetti et al.: TNG speckle observations of \u03bb Boo stars\n\nTable 2.

The data from\nRossiter (1955) are collected in Table 2, and demonstrate\nthe remarkable accuracy which may be obtained visually\nby an experienced observer with an appropriate instrument.\nThe star is not present in the Hipparcos catalogue, but\nis found in the Tycho catalogue. The transit data (37 accepted transits for the photometry) have been searched\nfor binarity but none was detected. There is also no variability flag, although the scatter in the VT magnitude is\n0.234.\nWe observed the binary only with a Str\u00f6mgren b filter and our results are summarized in Table 3. There is\ngood agreement with the measurements of Rossiter, but\nnot with the estimate of Paunzen & Gray (1997).\n\n6. Stars observed with negative result\nOther \u03bb Boo candidates have been observed in poor\nweather conditions. For all the observed stars we list in\nTable 4 the parallax and its error given by the Hipparcos\ncatalogue and, in the last column, the upper limit on the\npossible separation derived from considerations on seeing\nand SNR; the error is evaluated to be about \u00b1 10 mas.\nFor the two stars for which the separation has been measured, this upper limit is smaller than the measured separation. Taking into account the degradation of the fringe\ncontrast in the object power spectra due to the bad seeing, we were not able to separate stars closer than \u22480.\u2032\u2032 10\nalso considering the brightest objects and/or a small magnitude difference between the components. They deserve\nfurther observations for more stringent separation values.\nWe add here only a few comments on the duplicity\nof HD 153808, the star which has the lowest upper limit\non the possible separation of a companion. Controversial\nvisual binary detections are reported in the literature for\nthis star. Its duplicity is measured by Isobe et al. (1990,\n1992) from speckle observations, which are not confirmed\nby other authors (Miura et al. 1992, 1995; McAlister et al.\n1993; Kuwamura et al. 1993). This star has been observed\nby Hipparcos, but no sign of duplicity has been detected\n\nTable 4.

Batten et al.'s (1989) catalogue gives the orbital\nelements (a sin i being 3.91 \u00d7 106 and 6.2 \u00d7 106 km for the\ntwo components) and Hipparcos measured the parallax\n\u03c0 = 20.04 \u00b1 0.65 mas. According to these data the angular separation of the two components of the spectroscopic\nbinary system should be not higher than 0.13 mas and\nso these stars cannot be identified with those detected by\nthe speckle observations. This low expected value of the\nangular separation explains the lack of duplicity detection\nby the Hipparcos experiment as well as by our TNG observations. This demonstrates that when the the separation is too small to be detected by direct imaging and the\nspectral lines are too broad to separate the components\nby spectroscopic observations, it is impossible to establish\nthe binary nature of a system.\n\n7. Discussion\nThe characteristics of the \u03bb Boo stars are still not yet explained, in spite of the numerous efforts made, especially\nin the last two decades. The inhomogeneous properties of\nthe members of this class represent the most intriguing\naspect of the problem and the large area these stars occupy on the HR diagram represents a serious problem for\nthe determination of their evolutionary stage. We recall\nthat no systematic search for binaries has been made for\nthese objects and we consider this point as the first to be\n\n\fMarchetti et al.: TNG speckle observations of \u03bb Boo stars\n\nclarified before any study can be initiated (see Faraggiana\n& Bonifacio, 1999).\nOur search for binaries with the TNG speckle camera\nhas been severely limited by poor weather conditions, but\nit allowed us to confirm that two \u03bb Boo stars HD 38545\nand HD 290492 must be removed from this class of objects.\nBefore making any detailed analysis of peculiar objects\nand elaborating theories on their characteristics, a rigorous selection of true single objects is required. This may\nprove to be impossible from spectroscopic data alone.\nFor example, the duplicity of HD 38545 is now well established, thanks to speckle and astrometric observations,\nwhile it had never been suspected from the several analyses of its spectrum.\nThe case of HD 153808 represents an opposite example: high quality spectra revealed, over 60 years ago, that\nthe star is a binary, while the present speckle observations\nand the Hipparcos experiment did not succeed in detecting its duplicity. The dubious visual duplicity found by\nprevious speckle observations may suggest the presence of\na third body, which, however, cannot be responsible for\nthe SB2 system.\nThese two objects clearly show that a single best\nmethod to detect binaries does not exist; this is confirmed\nby the fact that the positive duplicity detection has been\nobtained for two stars which are not the brightest, nor the\nnearest objects (see V and \u03c0 values in Table 4) and not\neven those observed under the best conditions. We cannot\nguess which observing approach, direct imaging or spectroscopy, is more suitable for duplicity detection; only coordinated efforts using different observational techniques\nwill be efficient in revealing new binaries which produce a\ncomposite spectrum.\n\n8. Conclusions\nWe performed a search of duplicity among \u03bb Boo candidates using the speckle camera of the Galileo telescope.\nWe have been able to confirm the separation and \u2206m for\ntwo of the program stars; for the others we were able to\nplace stringent upper limits on the separation of a possible companion. The use of this instrumentation is promising mainly because it allows the determination of both\nseparation and \u2206m, which is not always possible by the\nspeckle approach. Due to the poor weather conditions we\nwere not able to assess if the theoretical diffraction limit\nmay be actually achieved nor could we establish the limiting magnitude and maximum \u2206m for successful binary\ndetection.\nAlthough we have shown that the speckle camera can\nwork even under bad weather conditions, the observations\nwould greatly benefit from a good seeing. In such conditions, the speckle camera should allow to reach an angular\nresolution which is almost an order of magnitude better\nthan that obtained by classical ground based instruments\nand comparable with that of space instrumentation.\nAcknowledgements.
