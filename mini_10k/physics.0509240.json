Introduction\nDuring the last few years a great amount of work from the physics community has\nbeen devoted to the application of methods from statistical physics to the study of\neconomic problems, or econophysics 1,2,3,4 . A wide range of problems have been\nstudied, for example, the shape of the distribution of price changes 5 , theoretical\nmodels of financial markets 6,7 , portfolio selection and optimization 8,9 , and wealth\ndistribution 10,11,12 , to name just a few.\nHere, our interest is the study, via Monte Carlo simulations on an agent based\nmodel, of brand competition in a bipartite market. We present a very simple \"toy\"\nmodel describing a situation where companies can choose one of two available brands\nof a certain product or service. The decision of which of the two available options will\nbe selected by the company is based on a cost and payoff mechanism. It is assumed\nthat the product or service has a certain cost, and the company will obtain a benefit\nor payoff from its use. The products are subject to technological innovation, and\n1\n\n\fNovember 18, 2018 18:58 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n2\n\nachach\n\nCasillas et al.\n\nthis innovation can persuade a company to switch to the competing brand. We also\nexplore the effect of anti monopolistic policies and brand fidelity.\n2. The model\nConsider a population of N agents that lie in a one-dimensional chain with periodic\nboundary conditions. Only nearest-neighbor interactions are allowed to keep the\nmodel as simple as possible. Each agent represents a company that uses some kind\nof tool or service of a certain brand (i.e. Apple or PC computers, Citibank or Lloyd's\nfinancial services, etc.). It can be assumed that an agent will not switch to another\nbrand unless something is gained with the change, for example, a company may be\nhappy using Apple computers but, if a big improvement or technological advance\nin PCs enters the market, then it may have a reason to switch computer brands.\nIn our model, we consider that only two different brands for a product or service\nexist, say A and B. Agents are given initially one or the other brand at random.\nNow suppose that a technological advance appears in one of the two brands, for\nexample in A. One of the agents using brand A will now have a better product,\nand the neighbors of this agent may also want to switch to the new improved A\nbrand, however, this change will have an associated cost. This cost will depend on\nwhether the neighbor is also using brand A or is using the other brand. Typically\nthe cost of upgrading the same brand is less than the cost of changing to a different\nbrand. It may be the case that the neighbor does not want to change because the\ntechnological improvement is too small to compensate for the cost of upgrading or\nchanging, and it may decide to wait for another version of the product to make the\nchange. If the neighbor decides to upgrade or change, then its own neighbor may\nalso want to do the same, and so on, until all agents change/upgrade or one decides\nnot to do so and the process stops. At this point a new improvement in one of\nthe brands enters the market and the process is repeated. The simulation therefore\nproceeds as follows:\nA set of N agents is created. Each agent is assigned at random a number that\nidentifies the brand that is using (0 or 1). The agent has also a real number T\nassigned that is a measure of how new its product is. For example an agent with a\nPentium 4 computer will have a higher value of T than an agent with a Pentium 2.\nA cost C of upgrading is defined, this cost applies when an agent wants to upgrade\nto a new version of the same brand. Another cost S is defined that applies when an\nagent wants to switch brands. Then:\n(1) Randomly pick one of the agents, say agent i, and increase its technological\nlevel T by a random amount \u03b4 between 0 and 1.\n(2) For the neighbor i + 1 calculate the quantity z = Ti \u2212 Ti+1 \u2212 cost, where cost is\nC if agents i and i + 1 use the same brand, and S if they use different brands.\n(3) If z > 0 then the gain in technological level is greater than the cost and the\nagent i upgrades or changes. If z \u2264 0 then agent i stays with its brand and does\nnot upgrade nor change.\n\n\fNovember 18, 2018 18:58 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nachach\n\nCONDENSATION IN AN ECONOMIC MODEL WITH BRAND COMPETITION\n\n3\n\n(4) Repeat steps (2) and (3) for i + 2, i + 3, . . . until one of the agents has z < 0 in\nwhich case the avalanche of upgrading/changing stops.\n(5) Repeat steps (2) to (4) for neighbor i \u2212 1.\n(6) One time step has finished. Return to step (1).\nThe repetition of the above process N times constitutes one Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), and its the unit of time. Note that an agent that upgrades or switches\nwill earn the quantity Ti \u2212 Ti+1 but it has to pay a cost C or S. Only when this\nquantity is greater than the cost will the agent upgrade or switch. Therefore several\ntime steps may be necessary until the sufficient quantity accumulates to offset the\ncost.\nThe simulation stops when all agents have the same brand. This phenomenon\nof condensation is observed to happen for any set of model parameters. The condensation time may be small or large, depending on those parameters, but the end\nresult is always a single brand system. The brand that wins in the end is basically\nthe one that, by chance, starts growing earlier, initiating a positive-feedback effect.\nThe initial growth is generally triggered by a high technological innovation. This\ncondensation on one of two initially equivalent brands has also been observed in\nprevious works in economics 13 , Ising models, and opinion dynamics 14 .\n3. Results\nCondensation times depend on both the cost of upgrading C and the cost of switching S. In Fig. 1 we show the results for condensation time as function of the switching\ncost. Each curve is for a different value of upgrading cost. As it can be seen, times\nincrease for higher values of the switching cost S. This is expected since more time\nsteps need to pass until the earnings are high enough to offset a high cost S. If we\nincrease the upgrading cost C, a similar curve is obtained, only with higher times.\nThe upgrading cost, unlike the switching cost, has a saturation value. That is, if\nwe increase C while keeping S fixed, the condensation time will stop increasing at\nsome point. This is due to the fact that if the upgrading cost is too high compared\nto the switching cost, agents will prefer to switch their brand as soon as they can\n(when one of its neighbors begin using a different brand). This is illustrated in Fig. 2\nSince there is no preference for any of the brands, either one can dominate the\nmarket with equal probability. As we said before, the process by which one of them\ngrows and eventually condensates is started by the formation of a cluster and the\neventual growth and coagulation with other same-brand clusters.\n3.1. Anti monopolistic policies\nCompanies can grow too big if they are left free to develop in an unregulated market.\nIn order to prevent the formation of monopolies, several types of antitrust laws are\nused. In our model, we introduce a simple antitrust rule: at each Monte Carlo step,\ncompanies are counted and the upgrading cost of the larger company is increased in\n\n\fNovember 18, 2018 18:58 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n4\n\nachach\n\nCasillas et al.\n\nproportion to its size. For example, if the number of companies using product A is\nlarger than the number of those using B, then the upgrading cost C for companies\nusing product A is increased by a factor\n\u0012\n\u0013\nNA\nf =1+k\n\u22121 ,\n(1)\nNB\nwhere Ni is the number of companies using product i and k is a parameter that\ncontrols the intensity of the antitrust mechanism. In the above formula, f = 1 when\nNA = NB , and increases linearly as NA /NB grows.\nAs it can be seen from the curves in Fig. 3, a higher value of the antitrust\nparameter k extends the condensation time, however, it saturates at some value\nof k, as shown in the inset. When k > 0, agents are penalized for upgrading their\nbrand, it becomes cheaper to switch, and this retards the condensation of the system.\nHowever, there is a point when k is so high, that agents do not upgrade, they simply\nstay with their old technology for very long time. At this point the value of k no\nlonger affects the dynamics, and we see the saturation shown in the inset. From a\npractical point of view, this implies that an antitrust mechanism can be good at\npreventing a monopoly but, if it gets too high, it will only retard the technological\ninnovations.\n3.2. Brand fidelity\nAnother mechanism that can slow the condensation process is brand fidelity. A\ncompany that is used to a certain product will be reluctant to change for several\nreasons, for example, it will have to train the employees in the use of the new product\nor service. There may be also concerns about the quality of customer service of the\nnew product, personal reasons, etc. All this ends up in that the company may have\na certain degree of fidelity for a particular product or service. This mechanism is\nmodeled introducing a modified switching cost:\ny\ny\n\u2212 ,\n(2)\nS(y) = S +\n1 + exp(\u2212t/10) 2\nwhere t is the number of time steps that a company has been using a particular\nbrand, and y is a parameter that controls the degree of fidelity. In this way, the\ncost of switching brands increases with time, up to an asintotic value y/2. Since as\ntime passes it becomes increasingly costly for a company to change its brand, this\nmechanism implies a higher degree of fidelity for companies that have more time\nusing a brand. Note that when t = 0, Eq. (2) reduces to S(y) = S.\nFigure 4 shows the results of this mechanism. Again we see that condensation\ntime increases with the fidelity parameter, in almost a linear fashion. The inset of\nthe figure shows that, unlike the antitrust parameter of the previous section, the\nfidelity parameter can be augmented without saturation in the condensation time.\nOf course, the extreme case when a company is completely faithful to a brand will\nmake the condensation time to diverge, therefore no saturation is expected in this\nparameter.\n\n\fNovember 18, 2018 18:58 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nachach\n\nCONDENSATION IN AN ECONOMIC MODEL WITH BRAND COMPETITION\n\n5\n\n4. Conclusions\nWe have studied a model of brand competition in the simplest case of two brands\nand nearest-neighbor one-dimensional dynamics. It is found that the system always\nreaches a condensed state where a single brand dominates the market. This state\nis reached despite the introduction of mechanisms to avoid it, like anti monopoly\nrules and fidelity to the brand behavior. These mechanisms succeed in delaying the\ncondensation but do not prevent it. The final single-brand state cannot be avoided\nand the system is doomed to become a monopoly. We have cited results from other\nauthors 13,14 that show a similar behavior, even in more than one dimension. In\nthe Sznajd model of opinion dynamics for example, condensation appears in all\ndimensions. Our future work will therefore extend the present model to include\nmulti-brand and two-dimensional situations.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was partially supported by a grant from CONACyT (M\u00e9xico).\nReferences\n1.

Each curve is for a different value of the parameter k which, from bottom to top are k =\n0, 0.1, 0.2, 1, 10. The inset shows the condensation time as function of k for a fixed value of S = 6,\nwith the lower curve corresponds to a value of C = 1 and the upper curve is for C = 2. Each point\nis averaged over at least 2500 independent realizations.\n\nFig. 4. Condensation time against the switching cost S for a fixed value of upgrading cost C =\n1. Each curve is for a different value of the parameter y which, from bottom to top are y =\n2, 5, 10, 15, 20. The inset shows the condensation time as function of y for a fixed value of S = 6,\nwith the lower curve corresponds to a value of C = 1 and the upper curve is for C = 2. Each point\nis averaged over at least 2500 independent realizations.\n\n\f"}
