He I is responsible for many lines in the optical and infrared spectra and they\nare commonly observed in nebular plasmas. Thus, the low temperature recombination\nspectrum (without dielectronic recombination) of He I has been extensively studied for over\nfour decades (Mathis 1957; Burgess & Seaton 1960a,b; Pottasch 1961; Robbins 1968, 1970;\nRobbins & Robinson 1971; Brocklehurst 1972; Bhatia & Underhill 1987; Almog & Netzer\n1989; Smits 1991, 1996; Hummer & Storey 1998; Benjamin, Skillman & Smits 1999). The\ntabulated results from these calculations have then been extensively used in the analysis of\nobserved spectra. Alternatively, a few models for the HeI system have been constructed,\nbased on the treatment by Cota (1987), for implementation into plasma modeling codes\n(e.g. CLOUDY by Ferland 1986; ION by Netzer 1987; XSTAR v.1 by Kallman & Krolik\n1995).\nThe emission from He-like ions other than He I is important in the X-ray spectra of\nastronomical and laboratory plasmas. Although the spectral lines from these ions that result\nfrom the n=2 levels have received much attention the treatment of recombination excitation\nhas alway been approximated, while no detailed calculation of these ions recombination\nspectra has been reported. The theory for computing the line intensities for transitions\nfrom the n=2 levels in coronal plasmas was developed by Gabriel & Jordan (1969, 1970,\n1972, 1973). This theory includes a treatment of dielectronic recombination contributions\nin addition to collisional excitation. The next major advance in the subject was made by\nMewe & Schrijver (1978a,b,c) who introduced approximated treatments for dielectronic and\nradiative recombination, collisional excitation, and inner-shell ionization. All of this was\nbased on poorly known atomic data which they fit according to ionic nuclear charge along\nthe whole isoelectronic series. Pradhan (1985) studied again the emission from n=2 states\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\npaying special attention to recombination contributions to the emission in non-coronal\nplasmas. Thus, most currently available spectra modeling codes simply extrapolate effective\nrecombination rates for any He-like ion from the He I rates using hydrogenic scaling rules.\nThere are at least two other difficulties with available He-like emission models and\ncalculations. One is that all of them are restricted to densities less than 1014 cm\u22123 . Yet,\nvarious kinds of astronomical X-ray sources of interest could be much denser, for example\nlow-mass X-ray binaries (Bautista et al. 1998) and accretion disks near extragalactic black\nholes (Nayakshin, Kazanas, and Kallman 2000). The other difficulty is that none of the\ncalculations and models correctly approach LTE under proper conditions. This invalidates\nthose results in the presence of strong radiation fields and in nearly optically thick plasmas.\nIn the present paper we start by presenting the atomic data used for the calculation.\nThen we described the calculations of level population and recombination spectra. In\nSection 4, we explain how the recombination-collisional-radiative models were constructed.\nIn Section 5 we compare the present models and their results with previous work. Finally,\nour conclusions are presented in Section 6.\n\n2.\n\nAtomic Data for He-like ions\n\nIn this section we describe the atomic data used in the present work. It is important to\nnote that all of the present calculations are carried out in LS coupling since fine-structure\nrecombination rate coefficients are unavailable. The LS approximation is expected to be\naccurate as long as \u2206n=0 radiative transitions are small and relativistic effects in the\nphotoionization cross sections and radiative transition rates remain small. Although the\npresent LS calculations are expected to be accurate additional work is currently in progress\nto compute the atomic data necessary for fine structure recombination calculations.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n2.1.\n\nEnergy levels and line wavelengths\n\nTerm energies and line wavelengths are taken from the compilation of the National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology (Martin, Sugar, and Musgrove 1999) when available.\nEnergies for other l \u2264 2 terms are from the TOPbase. Energies for l > 2 terms not known\nexperimentally are assumed as hydrogenic.\n\n2.2.\n\nPhotoionization cross sections and recombination rates\n\nWe use the photoionization cross sections for n\u2264 10 and l \u2264 2 of Fernley, Taylor, &\nSeaton (1987) calculated as part of the Opacity Project (OP hereafter; Seaton 1987) and\nwhich are available from TOPbase (Cunto et al. 1993). In principle one could obtain total,\nradiative and dielectronic, recombination rate coefficients by means of the Milne relation\nusing cross sections that resolve all autoionizing resonances. There are, however, some\nlimitations in the OP cross sections: (1) the cross sections are tabulated with an energy\nmesh too coarse to properly resolve the resonances. In fact, the number of points in the\ntabulated cross sections is so limited that even the radiative recombination rates cannot\nbe computed with accuracy better than \u223c5%; (2) The He I cross sections do not contain\nall contributing series of resonances, and the cross sections for other ions do not include\nany resonances at all; (3) the OP cross sections for He I are total cross sections, including\nphotoionization into the n=2 states of the hydrogen target ion. However, under most\nconditions the bulk of the recombining ions are in the ground state, so the calculation of\nrecombination rates should only use state specific photoionization cross sections to the\nground state of the target ion.\nTo solve these problems with the OP He I cross sections we remove the resonances\nby interpolation between points on opposite sides of the resonances. Later, we truncate\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nthe cross sections at the energy points right before the first n=2 target threshold and\nextrapolate the cross sections to higher energies using the quantum defect method of Peach\n(1967). In doing so, these quantum defect high energy cross sections are scaled to match\nthe OP cross sections at the crossing point.\nFor levels with n> 10 and l \u2264 2 we use cross sections from the quantum defect method.\nFor all levels with l > 2 hydrogenic cross section from the method of Burgess and Seaton\n(1960a) were used.\nThe state specific dielectronic recombination (DR) coefficients for n\u2264 10 and l \u2264 4\nwere taken from ADAS (Badnell et al. 1995). These ADAS rate coefficients are given in\ntabulated form at temperatures between (Z \u2212 1)2 \u00d7 103 and (Z \u2212 1)2 \u00d7 104 K which we fit\nwith an expression of the form\n\u03b1DR \u00d7 T 3/2 =\n\nX\n\n\u03c4i exp [(\u01ebi \u2212 \u01ebT )/kT ],\n\n(1)\n\ni\n\nfor i \u2264 4. Here, \u01ebT is the ionization energy of the ion and \u01ebi represents the energy of the\nautoionizing resonance i. The choice of such an expression and the values of \u03c4i and \u01ebi to fit\nthe DR coefficients are explained is Section 4.1. The resulting fits to the ADAS data are\naccurate to better than 1% in all cases.\nThe DR coefficients for n > 10 were estimated by n\u22123 extrapolation of the coefficients\nfor lower n. DR coefficients for states with angular momentum, l, greater than 4 are\nexpected to be very small and are neglected altogether.\n\n2.3.\n\nRadiative transition probabilities\n\nThe TOPbase data provides oscillator strengths, f , and transitions probabilities, A,\nfor n \u2264 10 and l \u2264 2 for He-like ions. These transition probabilities are generally accurate\nto within a few per cent. For He I more accurate data was calculated by Kono and Hattori\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n(1984). Recently, Nahar and Pradhan (1999) computed fine structure f -values for Fe XXV.\nTheir results when summed over fine structure agree well with the TOPbase data.\nFor n > 10 the A-values were computed using the Coulomb approximation methods\ndescribed in Smits (1991).\nTransition probabilities for the forbidden, 2 3 S \u2212 1 1 S, and intercombination,\n2 3 P \u2212 1 1 S, transitions were taken from Mewe and Schrijver (1978a), which are based\non computations by Drake (1969, 1971a, 1971b), Johnson and Lin (1974), and Drake and\nDalgarno (1969).\n\n2.4.\n\nCollision strengths\n\nWe adopt collisional data recommended by Dubau (1994) and Kato and Nakazaki\n(1989). These reviews consider data for levels up to n = 5 at most. Collisional rates for\nother n changing transitions were calculated using the impact parameter method (Seaton\n1962). Rates for angular momentum changing transitions by collisions with electrons,\nprotons, and alpha particles were computed using the impact parameter method but with\nthe modifications suggested by Hummer and Storey (1987).\n\n2.5.\n\nCollisional ionization and three body recombination\n\nCollisional ionization rates for excited levels are computed by using the semi-empirical\nformula by Sampson and Zhang (1988). This formula is based on extensive Distorted Wave\ncalculations of collisional excitation and is expected to be accurate for the He-like ions.\nHowever, the formula neglects the contributions of collisional excitation-autoionization\nwhich, in the case of ionization from the ground state, sometimes dominate the ionization\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nrate. Unfortunately, there is no data for excitation-ionization from excited levels. Thus\nwe estimate that collisional excitation rates from excited states may have uncertainties of\naround 50%. Three body recombination rates are obtained from the collisional ionization\nrates by means of detailed balance.\n\u03b13B\n\nwi 1\n=\nwi+1 2\n\nh2\n2\u03c0mkT\n\n!3/2\n\neIi /kT Ci\u221e .\n\n(2)\n\nwere Ci\u221e is the collisional ionization rate coefficient, wi and wi+1 are the statistical weights\nof the recombined and recombining ions, Ii is the ionization energy of the i state.\n\n3.\n\nCalculation of Level Populations\n\nUnder ionization-excitation equilibrium conditions the population of any level ni is\ngiven by\nni [\n\nX\n\n(Aij + Ne Cije + Np Cijp ) + +Ne Qi\u221e ] =\n\ni6=i\n\nP\n\nk<i\n\nnk Aki +\n\nP\n\nl<i\n\nnl (Ne Clie + Np Clip )\n\nN + Ne \u03b1i + N + Ne2 C\u221ei\n\nwhere Aij is the radiative transition rate from level i to level j. Ne /Np and Cije /Cijp are\nthe density per unit volume of electrons/protons and the transition rates by collisions\nwith electrons/protons respectively. N + is the density of the next ionization stage of the\nelement, i.e. the H-like ionic state in this case. \u03b1i is the rate coefficient for recombination\n(radiative plus dielectronic) to level i. Ci\u221e and C\u221ei are the collisional ionization and\n3-body recombination rate coefficients respectively. In principle, the sums in this equation\nincludes energy levels 1 through infinity. However, in the present calculation it was found\nsufficient to explicitply include levels up to n = 50 only, while cascades from higher levels\nwere accounted for by extrapolation.\nThis recombination-collision-cascade problem was solved with the matrix condensation\ntechnique (Burgess and Summers 1976) using the computer code developed by Smits (1991).\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nThe population of all levels up to n=50 of every ion were calculated for several\ntemperatures covering the entire range between 103 and 109 K and nine electron densities\nfrom 102 to 1018 cm\u22123 .\nThe high density calculations required special attention to account for the effects of\nlowering of the continuum and suppression of dielectronic recombination. The treatment of\nthese high density effects is described next.\n\n3.1.\n\nHigh density lowering of the continuum\n\nThe lowering of the continuum effect is very important under the high plasma densities\nconsidered here. This effect comes about from cutting the high-n orbitals of ions due to\nparticle packing, Debye shielding, Stark broadening, and collisional broadening. Under the\nconditions of interest here particle packing is the most important of these mechanisms.\nParticle packing occurs when the mean inter-nuclear separation in the plasma is smaller\nthan the distance from the nucleus to the high-n ionic orbitals. By comparing the mean\ninter-nuclear separation in the plasma with the mean size of ionic orbitals of principal\nquantum number n, one can define a continuum level as (Hahn 1997):\nnP = (1.8887 \u00d7 108 z/N 1/3 )1/2 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere z is the nuclear charge of the ion considered and N is the density of nuclei in the\nplasma in cm\u22123 .\nDebye shielding is the mechanism by which high-n orbitals are shielded from the\nelectrostatic attraction to the nucleus by a high density of free electrons. According to this\nmechanism the continuum level is given by (Hahn 1997):\nnD = 2.6 \u00d7 107 z 2 (Te /N)1/4 ,\n\n(4)\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nwhere Te is in Kelvin and z effective charge if the ion (i.e. z = Z \u2212 1 for He-like ions).\nUnder a high concentration of singly charged ions in a plasma a micro-electric-field is\nformed which will lead to Stark broadening of the atomic levels. Then, for sufficiently high\nn-numbers the atomic levels will merge with each other lowering the continuum. In this\ncase the continuum level is given by (Inglis & Teller 1939):\nnS = [1.814 \u00d7 1026 z 6 /N]2/15 .\n\n(5)\n\nFor temperatures lower than 105 Kz 2 /n free electrons contribute to the broadening through\nthe static Stark effect. So the density N in the last equation should include both positive\nand negative charges. At higher temperatures the electrons contribute to the broadening by\nmeans of collisions, but this is smaller than the Stark effect of the same electrons at lower\ntemperatures. Thus, only positive charges are considered in this case.\nFurthermore, one may define nC as the minimum of nP , nD , and nS . Then, only\norbitals with n < nC may be treated as bound, while orbitals with n > nC are mixed with\nthe continuum and must be excluded from the calculation of the recombination process.\nOne can see that in the case of hydrogen like oxygen (z=8), for example, under conditions\nof T=105 K and N= 1016 cm\u22123 only levels with n \u2264 83 are bound, at N = 1018 cm\u22123 only\nlevels with n \u2264 38 are bound, and at N = 1020 cm\u22123 only levels with n \u2264 18 are bound.\n\n3.2.\n\nHigh density suppression of dielectronic recombination\n\nThe effects of high electron densities and radiation fields on DR were studied by\nBurgess and Summers (1969). DR occurs by means of three basic processes:\n(1) Resonance capture, autoionization: X +z (i) + e\u2212 \u2194 [X +(z\u22121) (j, nl)];\n(2) Stabilization: [X +(z\u22121) (j, nl)] \u2192 X +(z\u22121) (i, nl) + h\u03bd;\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n(3) Cascade: X +(z\u22121) (i, nl) \u2192 X +(z\u22121) (i, n\u2032 l\u2032 ) + h\u03bd;\nwhere the brackets indicate an autoionizing state.\nUnder low electron density conditions the cascade process proceeds until the X +(z\u22121)\nion reaches its ground state, so that the recombination rate is just the total rate of all\nstabilizations.\nHigh electron densities may affect the reactions (1), (2), or (3) as follows:\n(a) The autoionizing states of the recombined ion, [X +(z\u22121) (j, nl)] in the right hand\nside of (1), could be affected by collisions with electrons. This would cause a redistribution\namong the different l-states, leading to an increase in the recombination rate coefficient.\n(b) Collisional deexcitation could assist the stabilization (process (2)) which would\nenhance the DR rate.\n(c) Collisional ionization could reduce the number of bound states involved in\nstabilization process (X +(z\u22121) (i, nl) in (2)). In other words, the lowering of the continuum\neffect, discussed in the previous section, will suppress DR in similar fashion as it reduces\nthe total radiative recombination rate.\nFor the range of densities considered here, Ne \u2264 1018 cm\u22123 , the effects (a) and (b)\ncan be neglected. This is because collisional transition rates, normally of the order of\nNe 10\u22125 /Te1/2 , have to compete with the much greater autoionization rates, of order 1015\ns\u22121 . Furthermore, the net effect of high electron densities considered here is to suppress\nDR. This has been calculated for some ions by various authors (e.g. Burgess and Summers\n(1969) and Summers 1972). On the other hand, Jordan (1969) computed an empirical\ncorrection factors to DR as function of the maximum bound orbital of the ion before the\ncontinuum. This approach allowed Jordan to calculate ionization balance in dense plasmas\nin good agreement, \u223c 5%, with the more elaborate computations of Summers (1972). We\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nadopt Jordan's method to compute DR suppression factors.\n\n4.\n\nIonization-excitation-spectra models\n\nThe computed level populations of the He-like ions that were obtained for density\nvs. temperature grids allow us to construct ionization-excitation-spectra (IES) models for\neach ion. These models are capable of simultaneously calculating the H/He-like ionization\nbalance and the line emissivities under a variety of conditions. Our models are similar to\nthose described for the He I case by Cota (1987), Almog and Netzer (1989) and Benjamin,\nSkillman, and Smits (1999). However, several improvements have been made with respect\nto those models to allow for accurate treatment of high densities, optical depth effects, and\nconvergence towards LTE.\nCota (1987) and Almog and Netzer (1989) explicitly consider a finite number of levels\nup to n = nmax and adopt four fictitious levels that account for all more excited levels. The\nrecombination cascades from the fictitious levels to the explicit levels are accounted for by\nusing averaged radiative transition probabilities weighted by the level population, which\nare assumed to be in LTE. This assumption introduces errors in the calculated spectrum,\nparticularly at low temperatures. In the model of Benjamin et al. (1999) cascades from\nlevels with n > nmax to the lower are summed over to define \"indirect\" recombination\nrates which are fit over a temperature range. This approach avoids the use of fictitious\nlevels and yields higher accuracy under some conditions. However, the method of Benjamin\net al. introduces new problems when considering optical depth effects. Let us consider\nfor example a model with indirect recombination rates computed under optically thin\nconditions (Case A). When using this model to solve the Case B problem one would shut\ndown all transitions to n=1. Then, the total recombination obtained this way would be\nthe total Case B recombination minus the fraction of recombination into n > nmax which\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\ncascades down to n=1. For even greater optical depths which affect transition to n=2,3,\netc. the error in the total recombination rate obtained by the Benjamin et al. approach will\nbecome worse.\nOur ionization-excitation model for He-like ions consists of all spectroscopic LS terms\nwith n\u22645 (i.e. 29 levels), 2 so called \"superlevels\", a level that represents the ground state\nof the H-like ion, and 6 doubly excited levels (2s2 1 S, 2s2p 1 P o ,3 P o , and 2p2 1 D,1 S,3 P ).\nThe superlevels are meant one for the singlets and one for the triplet states and are\nbuilt to account for all 5 < n \u2264 50 levels. To do that we define:\n- recombination rates (RR+DR and three body recombination), \u03b1s :\n\u03b1s =\n\nX\n\n\u03b1m ,\n\nm\n\n- radiative transition probabilities, As\u2192i :\nAs\u2192i =\n\nP\n\n- collisional deexcitation rates, Cs\u2192i :\nCs\u2192i =\n\nP\n\nm\n\nNm Am\u2192i\n,\nk Nk\n\nP\nm\n\nNm Cm\u2192i\n.\nk Nk\n\nP\n\nHere, the sums include all levels with 5 < n \u2264 50, Nm represents the population of the\nlevel m which is known from the recombination calculation described in Section 3. All\nof these rates for transitions involving the superlevels were computed for every pair of\npoints in the temperature vs. density grid. From these values the transition rates at any\ntemperature and density of interest can be obtained with accuracy of approximately 2% by\nlinear interpolation. In addition, all the inverse processes to these rates are calculated by\nmeans of detailed balance.\nIt is important to notice that by separating the collisional and radiative cascades\nfrom the superlevels one can correctly treat the problem of high density and high optical\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\ndepth where radiative decays from excited levels may be suppressed by self-absorption but\ncascades still occur via collisional deexcitation.\nThe doubly excited levels in the IES models were included to account for the most\nimportant satellite lines to H-like Ly\u03b1 emission. Excitation energies, line wavelengths,\nradiative transition probabilities and autoionizing rates were taken from Vainshtein and\nSafronova (1978). We also included electron impact excitation rates from bound to doubly\nexcited levels and between doubly excited levels from the calculations of Sampson, Goett,\nand Clark (1983) and Goett, Sampson, and Clark (1983).\nExplicit treatment of doubly excited levels introduces the additional practical\ncomplication that these levels will contribute to the DR to the bound levels. Thus, these\nDR contributions had to be subtracted from the total DR to each bound level as taken\nfrom the ADAS database (Badnell et al. 1985). On the other hand, the detailed treatment\nof doubly excited levels tends to improve the behavior of the models at high densities. This\nis because by considering collisional transitions involving these levels one accounts for the\neffects of redistribution of l states and collisional assisted stabilization in the DR process\n(see Section 3.2). In addition, collisional excitation from bound to doubly excited levels\nresults in excitation-autoionization contributions to the collisional ionization rates which\nare missing in the rates of Sampson and Zhang (1988).\nIt is important, however, to be cautious about the predictions of satellite lines due to\nthe large uncertainties in some of the current atomic data, particularly of the collisional\nrates for doubly excited levels which are based on Coulomb-Born-Exchange collision\nstrengths that neglect resonances. These resonances can dominate the collisional rates for\ndoubly excited levels. For example, Bautista (2000) recently showed that in the case of\ndoubly excited levels of Fe XVI the resonances in the collision strengths would enhance the\nexcitation rates by up to three orders of magnitude. Furthermore, improved calculations\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nof collision strengths and radiative and autoionization rates for He-like ions are currently\nunderway.\n\n4.1.\n\nConvergence to LTE\n\nOne important feature of the present IES models is their ability to converge to LTE\nunder appropriate condition. This characteristic is essential if they are to be applicable to\nconditions of dense plasmas and/or high radiation fields.\nFor an IES model to properly converge to LTE every transition rate must be balanced\nby its detailed balance inverse. In the present models the transitions rates of interest and\ntheir inverse are:\ncollisional deexcitation\nspontaneous transition probabilities\nthree \u2212 body recombination\n\n- collisional excitation cross sections,\n- induced transition probabilities,\n- collisional ionization cross sections,\n\nrecombination (RR + DR) - photoionization cross sections including\nautoionizing resonances.\nThe collisional and radiative transition rates are readily balanced from the effective\ncollision strengths, \u03a5, and A-values. Three-body recombination and collisional ionization\nbalance each other through Eqn.(2). The balance between recombination (RR+DR) and\nphotoionization is somewhat more complicated to achieve due to the fact we have only\nbackground photoionization cross sections (i.e. without autoionizing resonances). These\ncross sections balance only the RR component of the total recombination. To balance DR\none needs to work backwards from the DR rates to find at least the dominant autoionizing\nresonances.\nLet us consider a photoionization cross section with zero background and narrow\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nautoionizing resonances which can be approximated by delta functions at photon energies\n\u01ebi , i.e.\n\u03c3(\u01eb) =\n\nX\n\nai \u03b4(\u01eb \u2212 \u01ebi ).\n\n(6)\n\ni\n\nFrom this cross section and using the Milne relation the recombination rate is\nwz\n\u03b1=\nwz\u22121\n\ns\n\nX\n2h\n1\nai \u01eb2i exp [\u2212(\u01ebi \u2212 \u01ebT )/kT ],\n2\n3/2\n\u03c0 c (me kT )\ni\n\n(7)\n\nwhere wz and wz\u22121 are the statistical weights of the recombined and recombining levels\nrespectively and \u01ebT is the ionization threshold energy. This equation is equivalent to\nEquation (1), used to fit the ADAS DR rates, if one defines\n\u03c4i \u2261\n\nwz\n1.167 \u00d7 10\u221210 \u01eb2i ai ,\nwz\u22121\n\n(8)\n\nfor \u01ebi in Ryd and ai in Mb. The choice of the location of the autoionizing resonances\ncomes from the realization that the most prominent resonances are those that belong to\nthe Rydberg series converging to the n=2 states of the H-like recombining ions. These\nthresholds are located at energies of Z 2 (1 \u2212 1/4) Ryd above \u01ebT . Thus, the resonances are\napproximately (Z \u2212 1)2 /\u03bd Ryd below the threshold, with \u03bd=2, 3, 4, 5, ... Thus,\n3\n(Z \u2212 1)2\n\u01ebi \u2212 \u01ebT = Z 2 \u2212\n.\n4\n(i + 1)\n\n(9)\n\nIn practice, we found that at most four resonances are needed to fit the ADAS DR rates\nto an accuracy better than 1%. Then, these resonances were added to the background\nphotoionizations cross section in order to guarantee that the models converge to LTE under\nproper conditions.\n\n5.\n\nResults\n\nThe present section reports the results of the present IES models. We start by\ncomparing our effective recombination coefficients with other calculations. Then we focus\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\non the case of coronal ionization equilibrium and discuss various line ratio diagnostics for\noptically thin plasmas. Finally, the spectra from photoionized plasmas is discussed.\n\n5.1.\n\nRecombination to n=2 terms\n\nFigs. 1(a)-(b) show the effective recombination rate coefficients (direct recombination\nand cascades) vs. temperature for the n=2 terms 2 3 S, and 2 3 P o respectively. The rates\nare shown for various He-like ions (O VII, S XV, and Fe XXV). Also in the same figures we\nshow the rate coefficients from Mewe and Schrijver (1978a).\nOne can see from these figures that the present recombination rates differ significantly\nfrom those of Mewe and Schrijver. Particularly problematic is the high temperature where\nrecombination is dominated by DR. Here the discrepancies between Mewe and Schrijver\nand the present calculation can exceed a factor of four.\nAlso problematic are the recombination coefficients of Mewe and Schrijver for the\n2 1 S state which are systematically overestimated by a factor of \u223c 3. This is shown in\nFig. 2 (upper-left panel). Confirmation about the Mewe and Schrijver coefficients being\noverestimated can be obtained from the He I case. At T=104 K the direct recombination rate\ncoefficient to 2 1 S is 5.55 \u00d7 10\u221215 cm\u22123 s\u22121 (see Osterbrock 1989 and Benjamin et al. 1999)\nand our present total rate coefficient, including cascades, to this state is 6.55 \u00d7 10\u221215\ncm\u22123 s\u22121 , which is 16% lower than sum of \"direct\" and \"indirect\" recombination rates of\nBenjamin et al. . On the other hand, the Mewe and Schrijver is 1.99 \u00d7 10\u221214 cm\u22123 s\u22121 which\nis clearly too high by a factor of 3.\nFig. 2 presents the effective recombination coefficients for n=2 terms against ionic\nnuclear charge (Z) for temperatures of 104 \u00d7 (Z \u2212 1)2 K and low electron density. Also\nin this figure, are the results of Mewe and Schrijver (solid curves) and the hydrogenic\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nextrapolation with (Z \u2212 1) from neutral helium (dashed curves), i.e.\n\u03b1(T, Z) = (Z \u2212 1)\u03b1(T /(Z \u2212 1)2 , 1).\nThere is good agreement between the present results and those of Mewe and Schrijver\nfor 2 1 P and 2 3 S, but some differences are present in for the 2 3 P term as well as the\nsystematic factor of 3 discrepancy for the 2 1 S term. On the other hand, the hydrogenic\nextrapolation of the rate coefficients reproduces very well the recombination rates for 2 1 S\nand 2 3 S but it systematically overestimates the rate coefficients for the 2 1 P and 2 3 P\nterms. For the latter term, the hydrogenic extrapolation and the results of Mewe and\nSchrijver are almost indistinguishable.\nIt is important to note that the 2 3 S level is responsible for the well known forbidden\n(f ) line of He-like ions which is used in density and temperature line ratio diagnostics (see\nSection 5.2). Furthermore, the overestimation of the effective recombination rate to this\nlevel by MS yields erroneous diagnostics.\n\n5.2.\n\nDensity and Temperature Diagnostics\n\nThe emission lines that originate from transitions from n=2 levels to the ground state\nare the most intense in the spectra of He-like ions. These are three resolvable features\nin medium resolution spectra, i.e. the forbidden (f ) 2 3 S \u2212 1 1 S, intercombination (i)\n2 3 P \u2212 1 1 S, and resonant (r) 2 1 P \u2212 1 1 S transitions. Strictly speaking, the i feature is\ncomposed of two fine structure lines, i.e. 2 3 P2 \u2212 1 1 S0 and 2 3 P1 \u2212 1 1 S0 . Historically, these\nlines are also referred to as x and y lines, and the f and r lines are also called z and w.\nUnder collisional ionization conditions line ratios among the f, i, and r features\nare useful density and temperature diagnostics. In photoionized plasmas, however, these\ndiagnostics are misleading (Section 5.3). The intensity ratio R = If /Ii is sensitive to\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nelectron density above a critical value. This is because while the 2 3 S and 23 P states are\npopulated at nearly constant proportions for a wide rage of conditions the population of\n2 3 S can be excited to the 2 3 P state for densities such C(2 3 S \u2212 2 3 P )Ne \u2265 A(2 3 S \u2212 2 1 S).\nThe ratio G = (If + Ii )/Ir is particularly sensitive to temperature. This is because at\nhigh temperatures all the lines are mostly collisionally excited, but at lower temperatures\nrecombination dominates the population of the triplet states.\nBlends of satellite lines with the f and i lines complicate the picture as they too\nhave a temperature dependence. The satellite lines come from transitions of the type\n1s2 nl \u2212 1s2snl. Dielectronic recombination is the most important excitation mechanism\nfor the majority of these lines, but for some satellites collisional inner-shell excitation\nis important. The intensity ratio of dielectronic satellites to the the r line is roughly\nproportional to T \u22121 .\nFig. 3 shows the R ratios vs. Ne for several ions. The density sensitivity of the R ratios\nstarts at around 109 cm\u22123 for O VII and around 1016 cm\u22123 for Fe XXV. The systematic\nbehavior of the R and G ratios along the helium isoelectronic sequence were explored\nby Pradhan (1982). Under low density conditions the R ratios exhibit a relatively weak\ntemperature dependence.\nG ratios vs. temperature plots are shown in Fig. 4 (solid curves). These ratios present\nstrong temperature dependence which makes them good temperature diagnostics. Also in\nthis plots we show the ratios when the satellite contributions are included (dashed curves).\nThese satellite lines lie to the blue side but very close to the f and i lines. Thus satellites\nwill enhance the apparent G ratio as measured in low to medium resolution spectra. As a\nconsequence, neglecting the contributions of unresolved satellites in the spectra may result\nin underestimation of the temperature by up to one order of magnitude.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n5.3.\n\nEmission from Photoionized Plasmas\n\nThe traditional line ratio diagnostics discussed above are only applicable to coronal\nplasmas. On the other hand, photoionization may be the dominant ionization mechanism in\na variety of astronomical plasmas. The nature of the ionization mechanism (photoionization\nor collisional ionization) of the observed plasma must be established before diagnostics can\nbe performed. Fig. 4 shows the G ratio vs. temperature under photoionization conditions\n(dotted curves). It can be seen that observed ratio from photoionized plasmas departs\nconsiderably from that in the coronal case indicated by the solid curve. Thus, failure to\nrecognize photoionization contributions to the emitted spectra will result in misleading\ndiagnostics.\nDirect evidence of photoionized plasmas can be found in the strength of lines from\nthe n = 3 levels. The strongest of these lines are: 3 1 P \u2212 1 1 S and 3 3 D \u2212 2 3 P . Table 1\ncompares the relative strengths of these lines to the r line in a coronal and photoionized\nplasmas. The results are given for a 2 \u00d7 106 K coronal plasma, near the temperature of\nmaximum O VII abundance, and at a temperature of 105 K, near the thermal equilibrium\ntemperature, for a photoionized plasma. In general, lines from n = 3 levels are very weak\nor undetectable in coronal plasmas, while photoionized plasmas do produce these lines with\nstrengths of up to \u223c 25% of the r line.\nUnder photoionization conditions a good temperature diagnostic can be obtained from\nthe ratio I(3 1 P \u2212 1 1 S)/I(3 3 D \u2212 2 3 P ) (P ratio hereafter). This ratio is plotted against\ntemperature in Fig. 5. This ratio conforms a reliable diagnostic without blending with\nsatellite lines and with very high critical densities for collisional deexcitation.\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\n6.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have carried out detailed calculation of recombination spectra of the He-like ions\nHe I, C V, N VI, O VII, Ne IX, Mg XI, Si XIII, S XV, Ar XVII, Ca XIX, and Fe XXV.\nThe calculations include radiative and dielectronic recombination, collisional ionization and\nthree-body recombination, and the effects of high density lowering of the continuum.\nThese calculations allow us to build ionization-excitation-spectral models for fast\ncomputation of the spectra for modeling and/or spectral diagnostics. This models include\nall levels up to n = 5 and the most important satellite lines to the H-like spectra. The IES\nmodels are applicable to densities of up to 1018 cm\u22123 and converge to LTE under proper\nconditions.\nThe results of the IES models are compared with calculations by other authors. It is\nfound the present effective recombination rates differ significantly from earlier estimates\nby Mewe and Schrijver (1978a). For example, we find that the Mewe and Schrijver\nrecombination rates for the 2 1 S state are overestimated by a factor of three. The 2 1 S level\ndecays to the ground state either two-photon continuum or collisional transitions. Thus,\nthe discrepancy found in the recombination rates for this level will be important in trying\nto simultaneously model line and continuum emission. The difference in recombination to\nthe 2 1 S level may also affect the line emission spectrum under high density or high optical\ndepth conditions where the 2 1 S level contributes to the population of other levels.\nFurther, we present several line ratio diagnostics under coronal and photoionization\nconditions. It is shown that blends of satellite lines with the traditionally studied forbidden\nand intercombination lines can considerably enhance the apparent G ratio in coronal\nplasmas. Also, we find that the traditional R and G line ratio diagnostics used for coronal\nplasmas are misleading when the plasma is photoionized. Such photoionized plasmas can\nbe recognized by the presence of lines arising from n =3 levels in the spectra. Moreover,\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nthese lines can used for reliable temperature diagnostics.\nThe present IES models, data files and a computer code, is available upon request to\nthe authors. These models can be implemented in spectra modeling codes or used as a\nstand alone tool for spectral diagnostics. In this sense, the present IES models for He-like\nions and similar ones for H-like (Bautista et al. 1998) are already implemented in the\nphotoionization modeling code XSTAR v.2 (Kallman and Bautista 2000). For isoelectronic\nsequences other than H and He-like XSTAR v.2 accounts only for direct recombination to\nevery level, but calculations of more detailed recombination models like those described in\nthis paper are underway.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work has been supported in part by a grant from the Smithsonian Observatory\nfor the Emission Line Project.\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\n\nTable 1.
