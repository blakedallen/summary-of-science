Generalized Euler polynomials are also\nproposed.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to introduce new classes of polynomial sequences\nwhich represent a natural generalization of the classical Bernoulli and Euler\npolynomials. In particular, we introduce the notion of universal Bernoulli polynomials.\nThe Bernoulli polynomials [8] are defined by the generating function\n\u221e\n\nX Bk (x)\nt\next =\ntk .\nt\ne \u22121\nk!\n\n(1.1)\n\nk=0\n\nFor x = 0, formula (1.1) reduces to the generating function of the Bernoulli\nnumbers:\n\u221e\nX\nBk k\nt\n=\nt .\n(1.2)\net \u2212 1\nk!\nk=0\n\nThe Bernoulli polynomials are also determined by the two properties\nD Bn (x) = nBn\u22121 (x) ,\n\n(1.3)\n\n\u2206 Bn (x) = nxn\u22121 ,\n\n(1.4)\n\nwith the condition B0 (x) = 1. Here D is the continuous derivative, \u2206 := (T \u2212 1)\nis the discrete one, and T is the shift operator, defined by T f (x) = f (x + 1).\n1\n\n\fStandard references are the monographs [18] and [41] and the books [21] and\n[27]. By virtue of relation (1.3), the Bernoulli polynomials belong to the class\nof Appell polynomials. Formula (1.4) is the basis for the application of these\npolynomials in interpolation theory [36]. They also play an important r\u00f4le in\nthe theory of distributions in p\u2013adic analysis [29], in the theory of modular\nforms [31], in the study of polynomial expansions of analytic functions [9], etc.\nSeveral generalizations of them have also been proposed. Particularly important\nis that of Leopold and Iwasawa, motivated by a connection with the theory of p\u2013\nadic L\u2013functions [28]. Another example is provided by the work of Carlitz [11].\nRecently, new applications of the Bernoulli polynomials have also been found in\nmathematical physics, in connection with the theory of the Korteweg\u2013de Vries\nequation [22] and Lam\u00e9 equation [24], and in the study of vertex algebras [17].\nThe Bernoulli numbers are relevant in several branches of number theory, in\nparticular to compute rational values of the Riemann zeta function [14], [20],\nin the theory of cyclotomic fields [45] and, since Kummer's work, in connection\nwith Fermat's last Theorem [27]. They are also useful in singularity theory [3]\nand in connection with Coxeter groups [4]. Standard applications in algebraic\ntopology are found in the computation of Todd characteristic classes and in the\nHirzebruch signature Theorem, as well as, more recently, in complex homology\ntheory [6], [37]. In the last years Bernoulli number identities have found applications in Quantum Field Theory [19] and in the computation of Gromow\u2013Witten\ninvariants [23].\nInspired by the important works by Clarke [15], Ray [37] and Adelberg\n[1] on universal Bernoulli numbers, in this paper we introduce the following\ngeneralization of the Bernoulli polynomials.\nDefinition 1. Let c1 , c2 , ... be indeterminates over Q and let\nF (s) = s + c1\n\ns3\ns2\n+ c2 + ...\n2\n3\n\n(1.5)\n\nLet G (t) be the compositional inverse series:\nG (t) = t \u2212 c1\n\n\u0001 t3\nt2\n+ 3c21 \u2212 2c2\n+ ...\n2\n6\n\n(1.6)\n\nso that F (G (t)) = t. The universal higher\u2013order Bernoulli polynomials\nU\nU\nBk,a\n(x, c1 , ..., cn ) \u2261 Bk,a\n(x) are defined by\n\u0012\n\nt\nG (t)\n\n\u0013a\n\next =\n\nX\n\nk\u22650\n\nwhere x, a \u2208 R.\n\nU\nBk,a\n(x)\n\ntk\n,\nk!\n\n(1.7)\n\ni\n\nWe immediately observe that, when a = 1, ci = (\u22121) , then F (s) =\nlog (1 + s) and G (t) = et \u2212 1, and the universal Bernoulli polynomials and numi\nbers reduce to the standard ones. For a \u2208 Z, ci = (\u22121) we reobtain the\nhigher\u2013order Bernoulli polynomials, which have also been extensively studied\n2\n\n\fi\n\n(e.g. in [39], [12], [13], [26]). When x = 0, a \u2208 R and ci = (\u22121) formula (1.7)\nreduces to the standard N\u00f6rlund polynomials, and for ci \u2208 Q to the universal\nN\u00f6rlund polynomials.\nU\nck \u2208 Q [c1 , ..., cn ], where B\nck\nBy construction, the polynomials Bk,1\n(0) \u2261 B\nare the universal Bernoulli numbers introduced by Clarke in [15]. The name\ncomes from the fact that G (F (s1 ) + F (s2 )) is the universal formal group [25];\nthe series F is called the formal group logarithm and G the formal group exponential. The universal formal group is defined minimally over the Lazard ring\nL, which is the subring of Q [c1 , ..., cn ] generated by the coefficients of the power\nseries G (F (s1 ) + F (s2 )). The universal Bernoulli numbers have been recently\ninvestigated in the context of algebraic topology, in particular in complex cobordism theory, in [5], [35] and [37], where the coefficients cn are identified with\nthe cobordism classes of CP n . They also obey generalizations of famous congruences valid for the classical Bernoulli numbers, like the celebrated Kummer\nand Clausen\u2013von Staudt congruences [1], [27].\nWe will show that the universal polynomials (1.7) possess several interesting\nproperties. An intriguing one is a generalization of the Almkvist\u2013Meurman [2]\nand Bartz\u2013Rutkowski [7] congruences, before known only in the case of classical\nBernoulli polynomials.\nIn this paper we will study in particular a class of polynomials of the type\n(1.7) constructed from the finite operator calculus, as formulated by G.C. Rota\nand S. Roman [39], [40]. For a recent review of the vast literature existing on\nthis approach (also known, in its earlier formulations, as the Umbral Calculus),\nsee e.g. [10]. The Bernoulli\u2013type polynomials of order q considered here correspond to a class of formal power series G (t) obtained from the difference delta\noperator of order q (denoted by \u2206q ) introduced in [33], [34]. These polynomials, parametrized by a real variable a, are uniquely determined by the relations\nq\nq\nD Bn,a\n(x) = nBn\u22121,a\n(x) ,\n\n(1.8)\n\nq\n\u2206q Bn,a\n(x) = nxn\u22121 ,\n\n(1.9)\n\nq\nand by the condition B0,a\n(x) = 1. Generating functions as well as many combinatorial identities will be presented. For q = 1, a = 1, they coincide with the\nstandard Bernoulli polynomials. In the same spirit, a generalization of Bernoulli\npolynomials of the second kind is also proposed. Although the use of Roman\u2013\nRota's formalism, strictly speaking, is not indispensable for formulating our\nresults, it has the advantage of providing a natural and elegant language which\nallows the mathematical treatment of many polynomial sequences to be unified.\nThe original motivation for studying the polynomials proposed here is discrete mathematics. Indeed, they satisfy certain linear difference equations of\norder q in one variable, defined in a two\u2013dimensional space of parameters. In\n[33], [34] a version of Rota's operator approach, based on the theory of representations of the Heisenberg\u2013Weyl algebra introduced in [42], [43], has been\noutlined. One of the goals of this paper is to establish a connection between\nRota's approach and the theory of Appell and Sheffer polynomials. The basic\n\n3\n\n\fsequences associated with the delta operators \u2206q are studied in detail and some\nof their combinatorial properties derived. Their connection constants with the\nbasic sequence {xn } (and the associated inverse relations) define a class of generalized Stirling numbers of the first and second kind. The problem of classifying\nall Sheffer sequences associated with these delta operators is essentially open.\nEuler polynomials and numbers (introduced by Euler in 1740) also possess\nan extensive literature and several interesting applications in Number Theory\n(see, for instance, [18], [39], [44]). From many respects, they are closely related\nto the theory of Bernoulli polynomials and numbers. A generalization of Euler\npolynomials is also presented.\nDefinition 2. The Euler\u2013type polynomials are the Appell sequence generated\nby\n\u0013\u2212a\n\u0012\n\u221e\nX\nEkq,a,\u03c9 (x) k\n\u2206q\next ,\n(1.10)\nt = 1+\nk!\n\u03c9\nk=0\n\nwhere a, \u03c9 \u2208 R.\n\nDefinition 3. The Euler numbers Ekq,a,\u03c9 (0) are defined by\n\u221e\nX\nE q,a,\u03c9 (0)\nk\n\nk=0\n\nk!\n\n\u0013\u2212a\n\u0012\n\u2206q\n.\nt = 1+\n\u03c9\nk\n\n(1.11)\n\nFor q = a = 1, \u03c9 = 2, we reobtain the classical Euler polynomials. It will\nbe shown that these new polynomials possess many of the properties of their\nclassical analogues.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, some properties of universal\nBernoulli polynomials are discussed. In Section 3, a brief introduction to finite\noperator calculus is presented, with a discussion in Section 4 of the delta operator theory. In Section 5, generalized Stirling numbers are considered. In Section\n6, new Bernoulli\u2013type polynomials of the first kind are introduced. They are\nused in Section 7 to generate sequences of integer numbers. The Bernoulli\u2013type\npolynomials of the second kind are introduced and discussed in Section 8. The\nproposed generalization of Euler polynomials is discussed in the final Section 9.\n\n2\n\nSome properties of universal Bernoulli polynomials and numbers\n\nThe universal Bernoulli polynomials (1.7) possess many remarkable properties.\nBy construction, for any choice of the sequence {cn }n\u2208N they represent a class\nof Appell polynomials.\nWe easily deduce the following results. The Appell property is expressed by\nthe identity:\n\u0013\nn \u0012\nX\nn\nU\nU\nBn,a (x + y) =\nBk,a\n(x) y n\u2212k .\n(2.1)\nk\nk=0\n\n4\n\n\fU\nIn particular, for x = 0 we obtain an useful characterization of Bn,a\n(x).\n\nLemma 1. The higher\u2013order universal Bernoulli polynomials are expressed in\nterms of the higher\u2013order universal Bernoulli numbers by the relation\nU\nBn,a\n(x) =\n\n\u0013\nn \u0012\nX\nn\nU\nBk,a\n(0) xn\u2212k .\nk\n\n(2.2)\n\nk=0\n\nFrom relation (2.1), applying the operator\nU\nBn,a+b\n(x + y) =\n\n\u0010\n\nt\nG(t)\n\n\u0011b\n\nwe get\n\n\u0013\nn \u0012\nX\nn\nU\nU\nBk,a\n(x) Bn\u2212k,b\n(y) .\nk\n\n(2.3)\n\nk=0\n\nand, for (a + b) = 0,\nn\n\n(x + y) =\n\n\u0013\nn \u0012\nX\nn\nU\nU\n(x) Bn\u2212k,\u2212a\n(y) .\nBk,a\nk\n\n(2.4)\n\nk=0\n\nA recurrence formula is valid:\nU\nBn+1,a\n(x) =\n\n\u0012\n\nx\u2212\n\nG\u2032 (t)\nG (t)\n\nThe following multiplication property holds:\nBnU (\u03b1x) =\n\n\u0013\n\nBnU (x) .\n\nG (t)\nB U (x) .\nG (t/\u03b1) n\n\n(2.5)\n\n(2.6)\n\nIn the case of classical Bernoulli polynomials it reduces to the famous Raabe\nmultiplication Theorem.\nU\ncn correspond to the well\u2013known universal Bernoulli\nThe values Bn,1\n(0) := B\nnumbers. Here we mention only two of their most relevant properties.\ni) The universal Von Staudt's congruence [15].\nIf n is even,\ncn \u2261 \u2212\nB\n\nX cn/(p\u22121)\np\u22121\np\n\nmod Z [c1 , c2 , ...] ;\n\n(2.7)\n\np\u22121|n\n\npprime\n\nIf n is odd and greater than 1,\nn\u22123\nn\ncn \u2261 c1 + c1 c3\nB\n2\n\nmod Z [c1 , c2 , ...] .\n\n(2.8)\n\nWhen cn = (\u22121)n , the celebrated Clausen\u2013Von Staudt congruence for Bernoulli\nnumbers is obtained.\nii) The universal Kummer congruences [1]. The numerators of the classical\nBernoulli numbers play a special r\u00f4le, due to the Kummer congruences and to\n5\n\n\fthe notion of regular prime numbers, introduced in connection with the Last\nFermat Theorem (see, for instance, [27]). The relevance of Kummer's congruences in algebraic geometry has been enlightened in [6]. More general versions of\nthese congruences for the classical Bernoulli numbers are known in the literature\nbn satisfy an universal congruence.\n[44]. As shown by Adelberg, the numbers B\nSuppose that n 6= 0, 1 (mod p \u2212 1).

Bartz and Rutkowski [7] have proved a Theorem which combines the results of Almkvist and Meurman [2] and Clausen\u2013von Staudt. The\nmain result of this section is a simple generalization of the Almkvist\u2013Meurman\nand Bartz\u2013Rutkowski Theorems for a class of Bernoulli\u2013type polynomials.\nTheorem 1.

I,\npag 271).\nProof of Theorem 1. It is a straightforward generalization of the proof\nof the Almkvist\u2013Meurman Theorem given in [7]. The argument is based on the\ninduction principle on t with s fixed.

More generally, in Section 6 polynomial sequences satisfying\nTheorem 1 will be explicitly constructed using the finite operator theory.\nMany other congruences concerning the universal Bernoulli polynomials and\nnumbers can be constructed. They will be discussed in a future publication.\n\n3\n\nFinite operator calculus\n\nIn this Section some basic results of the theory of finite difference operators\nand their relation with classical polynomial sequences are reviewed. For further\ndetails and proofs, see the monographs [40], [39], where an extensive and modern\ntreatment of this topic is proposed.\nLet F denote the algebra of formal power series in one variable t, endowed\nwith the operations of sum and multiplication of series. Let P be the algebra of\npolynomials in one variable x and P \u2217 the vector space of all linear functionals\non P. If L \u2208 P \u2217 , following Dirac we will denote the action of L on p (x) \u2208 P by\nhL| p (x)i. A remarkable fact of the finite operator calculus is that any element\nof F can play a threefold r\u00f4le: It can be regarded as a formal power series, as a\nlinear functional on P and also as a linear operator on P. To prove this, let us\nfirst notice that, given a formal power series\nf (t) =\n\n\u221e\nX\nak\nk=0\n\n8\n\nk!\n\ntk ,\n\n(3.1)\n\n\fwe can associate it with a linear functional via the correspondence\nhf (t)| xn i = an .\nTherefore\nf (t) =\n\n\u221e\nX\nhf (t)| xk\n\nk!\n\nk=0\n\nIn particular, since\n\n(3.2)\n\ntk .\n\ntk xn i = n!\u03b4 n,k ,\n\n(3.3)\n\n(3.4)\n\nit follows that, for any polynomial p (x)\ntk p (x)i = pk (0) .\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere pk (0) denotes the k\u2013derivative of p (x) evaluated at x = 0. It is easily\nshown that any linear functional L \u2208 P \u2217 is of the form (3.3).\nIf we interpret tk as the k\u2013th order derivative operator on P, given a polynomial p (x) we have that tk p (x) = p(k) (x). Hence the formal series\nf (t) =\n\n\u221e\nX\na k tk\n\nk=0\n\nk!\n\n(3.6)\n\nis also regarded as a linear operator acting on P. Depending on the context, t\nwill play the r\u00f4le of a formal variable or that of a derivative operator.\nNow, some basic Definitions and Theorems of finite operator theory, necessary in the subsequent considerations, are in order.\nDefinition 4. An operator S commuting with the shift\u2013operator\n[S, T ] = 0\nis said to be shift\u2013invariant.\nRelevant examples of operators belonging to this class are provided by the\ndelta operators.\nDefinition 5. A delta operator Q is a shift\u2013invariant operator such that Qx =\nconst 6= 0.\nAs has been proved in [40], there is an isomorphism between the ring of\nformal power series in a variable t and the ring of shift\u2013invariant operators,\ncarrying\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nX\na k tk\nak Q k\nf (t) =\ninto\n.\n(3.7)\nk!\nk!\nk=0\n\nk=0\n\nIn the following let us denote by pn (x) a polynomial of order n in x.\n\n9\n\n\fDefinition 6. A sequence of basic polynomials for a delta operator Q is a\npolynomial sequence satisfying the following conditions:\n1) p0 (x) = 1;\n2) pn (0) = 0 \u2200 n > 0;\n3) Qpn (x) = npn\u22121 (x).\nFor each delta operator there exists a unique sequence of associated basic\npolynomials.\nDefinition 7. A polynomial sequence is called a set of Sheffer polynomials for\nthe delta operator Q if\n1) s0 (x) = c 6= 0;\n2) Qsn (x) = nsn\u22121 (x).\nDefinition 8. An Appell sequence of polynomials is a Sheffer set for the delta\noperator D .\nAny shift invariant operator S can be expanded into a formal power series\nin terms of a delta operator Q:\nX ak\nQk ,\nS=\nk!\nk\u22650\n\nwith ak = [Spk (x)] |x=0 , where pk is the basic polynomial of order k associated\nwith Q. By using the isomorphism (3.7), a formal power series s (t) is defined,\nwhich is called the indicator of S.\nRemark 1. A shift invariant operator is a delta operator if and only if it\ncorresponds, under the isomorphism (3.7), to a formal power series G (t) such\nthat G (0) = 0 and G\u2032 (0) 6= 0. This series admits a unique compositional\ninverse.\nThe umbral formalism also allows us to characterize the generating functions\nof classical polynomial sequences of Sheffer and Appell type.\nIf sn (x) is a Sheffer set for the operator Q, then there exists an invertible\nshift\u2013invariant operator S such that\nS sn (x) = pn (x) ,\nwhere pn (x) is a basic set for Q.\nLet us denote by s (t) and q (t) the indicators of the operators S and Q. We\nwill say that sn (x) is the Sheffer sequence associated with (s (t) , q (t)). The\nfollowing result holds:\n1\ns (q \u22121 (t))\n\nexq\n\n\u22121\n\n(t)\n\n=\n\nX sn (x)\ntn ,\nn!\n\nn\u22650\n\nwhere q \u22121 (t) denotes the compositional inverse of q (t).\n\n10\n\n(3.8)\n\n\fAnother characterization of a Sheffer sequence is provided by the identity\nX\u0012 n \u0013\nsn (x + y) =\nsk (x) qn\u2212k (y) .\nk\nk\u22650\n\nIn the specific case of the Appell sequences, which obey the equation\nD sn (x) = nsn\u22121 (x) ,\n\n(3.9)\n\nthere exists an invertible operator g (t) such that\ng (t) sn (x) = xn .\n\n(3.10)\n\nTherefore, we will say that sn (x) is the Appell sequence associated with g (t).\nIts generating function is defined by\n\u221e\nX\nsk (x)\n\nk=0\n\nThe Appell identity is\n\nk!\n\ntk =\n\n1 xt\ne .\ng (t)\n\n(3.11)\n\n\u0013\nn \u0012\nX\nn\nsn (x + y) =\nsk (y) xn\u2212k .\nk\n\n(3.12)\n\nk=0\n\nWe also recall the polynomial expansion Theorem. If sn (x) is a Sheffer set\nfor the operators (s (t) , q (t)), then for any polynomial p (x) we have:\nD\nE\nk\nX s (t) q (t) | p (x)\nsk (x) .\n(3.13)\np (x) =\nk!\nk\u22650\n\nIn particular, if qn (x) is a basic sequences, this formula reduces to\nD\nE\nk\nX q (t) | p (x)\np (x) =\nqk (x) .\nk!\n\n(3.14)\n\nk\u22650\n\n4\n\nDifference delta operators\n\nIn this paper, we will consider a specific class of difference operators, introduced\nin [33], having the general form\nQ \u2261 \u2206q =\n\nm\n1X\nak T k ,\n\u03c3\nk=l\n\nl, m \u2208 Z,\n\nl < m,\n\nm \u2212 l = q,\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere ak and \u03c3 are constants. In order to fulfil the Definition of delta operator,\nwe must assume that\nm\nm\nX\nX\nak = 0,\nkak = c,\n(4.2)\nk=l\n\nk=l\n\n11\n\n\fWe also require that in the continuous limit \u2206 reproduces the standard derivative D; this implies c = 1, i.e.\nm\nX\n\nkak = 1.\n\n(4.3)\n\nk=l\n\nDefinition 9. A delta operator of order q = m \u2212 l is a difference operator of\nthe form (4.1) which satisfies eqs. (4.2) and (4.3).\nWe observe that eq. (4.1) involves m \u2212 l + 1 constants ak , subject to two\nconditions (4.2) and (4.3). To fix all constants ak we have to impose m \u2212 l \u2212\n1 further conditions. A possible choice is, for instance\nm\nX\n\n\u03b3q \u2261\n\nk q ak = 0,\n\nq = 2, 3, ..., m \u2212 l.\n\nk=l\n\n(4.4)\n\nWhen conditions (4.2), (4.3) and (4.4) are satisfied, the operator (4.1) provides\nan approximation of order p of the continuous derivative D, since\nm\n\n\u2206f \u223c f \u2032 (x) +\n\u03c3\u21920\n\nX\n\u03c3 m\u2212l\nf (m\u2212l\u22121) (x)\nak k m\u2212l\u22121 .\n(m \u2212 l + 1)!\nk=l\n\nFrom now on, we will put \u03c3 = 1. The Pincherle derivative of a delta operator\nis defined by the relation\nQ\u2032 = [Q, x] .\nNow, let us introduce a shift\u2013invariant operator \u03b2 such that\n[\u2206, x\u03b2] = 1.\n\n(4.5)\n\n\u22121\n\nIt follows that \u03b2 = (\u2206\u2032 )\n[32]\u2013[34]. Such an operator is invertible [40] and\nfinite. Indeed, if \u2206 is of order n, using the identity \u03b2\u03b2 \u22121 = 1, the action of \u03b2\non a monomial of order n is easily seen to be\n\u03b2xn = xn \u2212\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\n\u03b1nj xn\u22121\u2212j ,\n\n(4.6)\n\nj=0\n\nwhere \u03b1nj are defined via the recursion relation\n\u03b1nj =\nPm\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\u0013\nj\u22121 \u0012\nX\nn\nn\n\u03b3 j+2 \u2212\n\u03b3 \u03b1n\u2212l\u22121 ,\nj+1\nl + 1 l+2 j\u2212l\u22121\nl=0\n\nwith \u03b3 j = k=l k j ak . We see that \u03b2 preserves polynomial structures. When\n\u2206 = D, \u03b2 = 1. Other specific cases are listed below: for\n\u2206 = \u2206+ = T \u2212 1, \u03b2 = T \u22121 ;\n12\n\n(4.7)\n\n\ffor\n\u2206 = \u2206\u2212 = 1 \u2212 T \u22121 , \u03b2 = T .\nWhen\n\u22062 = \u2206s =\n\nT \u2212 T \u22121\n, \u03b2=\n2\n\n\u0012\n\nT + T \u22121\n2\n\n(4.8)\n\u0013\u22121\n\n.\n\n(4.9)\n\nOther nontrivial examples of higher\u2013order operators, for instance, are provided\nby\n\u0001\n(4.10)\n\u22063 = \u2212 T 2 \u2212 2T + T \u22121 ,\n3\n3\n\u22064 = T 2 \u2212 T + T \u22121 \u2212 T \u22122 ,\n2\n2\n\n(4.11)\n\n\u22065 = T 3 \u2212 2T 2 + 2T \u2212 2T \u22121 + T \u22122 ,\n\n(4.12)\n\n\u22066 = T 3 \u2212 2T 2 + 2T \u2212 T \u22121 \u2212 T \u22122 + T \u22123 ,\n\n(4.13)\n\n\u22067 = T 4 \u2212 T 3 + T 2 \u2212 2T + T \u22121 \u2212 T \u22122 + T \u22123 .\n\n(4.14)\n\nFinally, we recall that Q is a delta operator if and only if it is of the form\nQ = DP , where P is an invertible shift\u2013invariant operator [40]. It follows that\nthe sequence of basic polynomials for Q is expressible in the form\npn (x) = xP \u2212n xn\u22121 .\n\n5\n\n(4.15)\n\nA generalization of the Stirling numbers\n\nAccording to Rota's approach, with any delta operator of the form (4.1)\u2013(4.3) it\nis possible to associate a sequence of basic polynomials. In perfect analogy with\nthe classical theory of Stirling numbers, this allows to study generalizations of\nStirling numbers. In this section, several concrete examples of these basic polynomials as well as generalized Stirling numbers are obtained. This construction\nrepresents a natural realization of the very general scheme proposed by Ray\nin [37], who first studied the basic sequences and defined the universal Stirling\nnumbers for any delta operator constructed via the complex homology theory.\nHere we will follow a different but equivalent philosophy: the basic sequences\nfor the operators (4.1)\u2013(4.3) are simply derived from the \"discrete\" representations of the Heisenberg\u2013Weyl algebra; the associated Stirling numbers furnish\nthe connection coefficients between the basic sequences and the standard power\nsequence {xn }n\u2208N .\nWe remind that the classical Stirling numbers of the first and second kind\ns (n, k) and S (n, k) are defined by the relations [38]\n(x)n =\n\nn\nX\n\ns (n, k) xk\n\nk=0\n\n13\n\n(5.1)\n\n\fand\nn\n\nx =\n\nn\nX\n\nS (n, k) (x)k ,\n\n(5.2)\n\nk=0\n\nrespectively. Here (x)n = x (x \u2212 1) ... (x \u2212 n + 1) denotes the lower factorial\npolynomial of order n. The numbers S (n, k) also admit a representation in\nterms of a generating function:\n\u221e\nX\n\nk\n\nS (n, k)\n\nn=0\n\nxn\n(ex \u2212 1)\n=\n.\nn!\nk!\n\nAs is well known, the lower factorial polynomials are the basic sequence associated with the forward derivative: \u2206 (x)n = n (x)n\u22121 . More generally, the basic\nsequence associated with the operator \u2206q , denoted by (x)qn , is [33]\nn\n\nTherefore,\n\n(x)qn = (x\u03b2) 1.\n\n(5.3)\n\n\u2206(x)qn = n(x)qn\u22121 .\n\n(5.4)\n\nExplicitly, the first basic polynomials are expressed by\n0\n\n(x)q0 = (x\u03b2) 1 = 1,\n1\n\n(x)q1 = (x\u03b2) 1 = x,\n2\n\n(x)q2 = (x\u03b2) 1 = x2 \u2212 \u03b3 2 x,\n\n\u0001\n(x)q3 = (x\u03b2)3 1 = x3 \u2212 3\u03b3 2 x2 \u2212 \u03b3 3 \u2212 3\u03b3 22 x,\n\u0001\n\u0001\n4\n(x)q4 = (x\u03b2) 1 = x4 \u2212 6\u03b3 2 x3 + \u22124\u03b3 3 + 15\u03b3 22 x2 + \u2212\u03b3 4 + 10\u03b3 2 \u03b3 3 \u2212 15\u03b3 32 x,\n(5.5)\nand so on, with \u03b3 j defined by\n\u03b3j =\n\nm\nX\n\nak k j ,\n\n\u03b3 0 = 0,\n\n\u03b3 1 = 1,\n\nj = 0, 1, 2, ....\n\n(5.6)\n\nk=l\n\nDefinition 10. The generalized Stirling numbers of the first kind and order q\nassociated with the operators (4.1)\u2013(4.3), denoted by sq (n, k), are defined by\n(xn )q =\n\nn\nX\n\nsq (n, k) xk .\n\n(5.7)\n\nk=0\n\nRemark 2. In the subsequent considerations, with an abuse of notation, we\nwill use Roman numbers for denoting the values of q, when q appears as an\nindex in sequences of polynomials or numbers. This to avoid possible confusion\nwith exponents.\n14\n\n\fObserve that (x)In = (x)n and sI (n, k) = s (n, k).

The Euler\u2013type\npolynomials satisfy the Appell property\nq,a\nDEnq,a (x) = nEn\u22121\n(x)\n\nand the Appell binomial identity\nEnq,a\n\n\u0013\nn \u0012\nX\nn\n(x + y) =\nEkq,a (y) xn\u2212k .\nk\n\n(9.4)\n\nk=0\n\nAs in the standard case, this enables to define Euler\u2013type polynomials in terms\nof Euler numbers:\n\u0013\nn \u0012\nX\nn\nEkq,a (0) xn\u2212k .\n(9.5)\nEnq,a (x) =\nk\nk=0\n\nIt also emerges that for every q the polynomials (9.3) are an Appell cross\u2013\nsequence:\n\u0013\nn \u0012\nX\nn\nq, b\nEnq, a+b (x + y) =\nEkq, a (y) En\u2212k\n(x) .\n(9.6)\nk\nk=0\n\nWe also have a recurrence formula :\n\u0012\n\u0013\ngq\u2032 (t)\nq,a\nEn+1 (x) = x \u2212\nEnq,a (x) ,\n(9.7)\ngq (t)\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2206 (t)\nwhere gq (t) = 1 + q\u03c9 .\nThere exists an interesting analogue of the famous Boole summation formula.\nSince, for any function h (t)\n\u0012\n\u0013a\n\u221e\nX\nhh (t)| Ekq,a (x)i\n\u2206q\n1+\ntk ,\nh (t) =\nk!\n\u03c9\nk=0\n\nthen, choosing h (t) = exp (yt) we get\n\u0012\n\u0013a\n\u221e\nX\nEkq,a (y)\n\u2206q\nexp (yt) =\n1+\ntk .\nk!\n\u03c9\nk=0\n\n24\n\n(9.8)\n\n\fOnce applied to a polynomial p (x), in the case a = 1 we obtain for any q the\nexpansion\n\u0012\n\u0013a\n\u221e\nX\nEkq,a (y)\n\u2206q\np (x + y) =\n1+\np(k) (0) .\nk!\n\u03c9\nk=0\n\nLet us first consider the operator (for q = 2)\n\u0013a\n\u0012\net \u2212 e\u2212t\n.\ng II (t) = 1 +\n\u03c9\n\nCorrespondingly,\nEnII,a (x) =\nFirst we observe that, since\ng\n\nII\n\n(t)\n\n\u22121\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\u2212a\net \u2212 e\u2212t\n1+\nxn .\n\u03c9\n\n1\n1+\n\n(9.9)\n\net \u2212e\u2212t\n\u03c9\n\n!a\n\n=\n\n(9.10)\n\n\u0013\u0012 t\n\u0013j\n\u221e \u0012\nX\n\u2212a\ne \u2212 e\u2212t\nj=0\n\nj\n\n\u03c9\n\n,\n\n(9.11)\n\nthe polynomials (9.10) are of the form\n\u0013\u0012 t\n\u0013\n\u0013j\n\u221e \u0012\nn X\nn \u0012\nX\nX\n\u2212a\ne \u2212 e\u2212t\n\u2212a j! 2j II\nII,a\nn\nEn (x) =\nx =\nS (k, j) xn\u2212k .\nj\nj\nj\n\u03c9\nk!\n\u03c9\nj=0\nj=0\nk=0\n\n(9.12)\nFrom this equation and from the Definition (9.10) we derive the difference equation\nEnII,a (x + 1) \u2212 EnII,a (x \u2212 1) = \u03c9EnII,a\u22121 (x) .\n(9.13)\n\nThe analogue of the Newton expansion is given by the formula\n\u0013\nn X\nn \u0012\nX\n\u2212a 1\nII,a\n(j)k S II (n, j) xII\nEn (x) =\nj\u2212k ,\nk \u03c9k\n\n(9.14)\n\nwhich is easily derived from eq. (9.12) and from the formula\n\u0012 t\n\u0013k\nn\nX\ne \u2212 e\u2212t\nxn =\nS II (n, k) (j)k xII\nj\u2212k .\n2\n\n(9.15)\n\nk=0 j=k\n\nj=k\n\nFinally, from the recurrence formula (9.7) (for q = 2) we have:\n\u0012\n\u0013\net + e\u2212t\nII,a\nEn+1 (x) = x \u2212\nEnII,a (x) ,\n\u03c9 + et \u2212 e\u2212t\n\nproviding another difference equation satisfied by EnII,a (x):\nII,a\nEn+1\n(x) = xEnII,a (x) \u2212\n\n\u0001\n1\nEnII,a+1 (x + 1) + EnII,a+1 (x \u2212 1) .\n\u03c9\n\n(9.16)\n\nAcknowledgments\nI am grateful to A.
