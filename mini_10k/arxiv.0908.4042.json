INTRODUCTION\n\nFirst observed by Uhuru and Ariel V, the low luminosity (\u223c1035 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ) hard x-ray source 4U 2206+54 is\none of a handful of well studied galactic high mass x-ray\nbinaries for which the nature of the accreting compact\nstar is uncertain.\nOptical and UV spectroscopy have showed the optical\ncounterpart, BD +53\u25e6 2790 to be an unusual O9 active\nstar with strong wind resonance lines in the ultraviolet (Negueruela & Reig 2001). Several authors have concluded from the high column depth and the flaring observed in the x-rays that the compact object is accreting\nfrom a strong stellar wind. Rib\u00f3 et al. (2006) determine\nfrom the an IUE spectra a relatively low wind velocity\nof \u223c350 km s\u22121 .\nAnalysis of the first five years of the RXTE ASM lightcurve of 4U 2206+54 revealed a periodic modulation at a\nperiod of 9.57 days, which was interpreted as the orbital\nperiod of the binary system (Corbet & Peele 2001). Radial velocity measurements were made for BD +53\u25e6 2790,\nhowever it was not possible to independently determine\nthe orbital period from them (Blay 2005). Recent analyses of the Swift/BAT and RXTE/ASM light-curves have\nthrown this picture into confusion (Corbet et al. 2007).\nThe recent data shows a modulation with a period of\n19.25 days \u2013 twice what was previously thought to be\nthe period. If 19.25 days is the orbital period, then the\nprofile of the orbital modulation has evolved from having\ntwo peaks per orbit to one peak per orbit.\nUsing observations extended over 7 days from the Proportional Counter Array (PCA)on the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) Reig et al. (2009) discovered pulsations at a period of 5559\u00b13 s. Detecting pulsations in this\nperiod range from a low Earth orbit is usually difficult be1 National Space Science and Technology Center, 320 Sparkman\nDrive, Huntsville, AL\n2 Universities Space Research Association, 6767 Old Madison\nPike, Suite 450, Huntsville, Alabama 35806\n3 Space Science Office, VP 62, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, AL 35812\n4 Pulkovo Observatory, 196140 St. Petersburg, Russia\n5 Optical Sciences Corporation, 6767 Old Madison Pike, Suite\n650, Huntsville, Alabama 35806\n\ncause the pulse period is near the orbital period, resulting\nin poor sampling of pulses. Their data however include\nseveral intervals which were uninterrupted by Earth occultation. They also confirmed this discovery using observations from IBIS on the International Gamma-ray\nAstrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL) which has a high\nEarth orbit with a 3 day period.\nIn section 2 we present results from new observations\nof 4U 2206+54 we have made with Suzaku. These observations were contemporaneous with those of RXTE\n(Reig et al. 2009). We find strong pulsations at a pulse\nperiod of 5554\u00b19 s, in agreement with the RXTE results.\nIn section 3 we present a reanalysis of the BeppoSAX observations of 4U 2206+54 which show strong pulsations\nat a period of 5420 \u00b1 28 s, in section 4 we discuss simulations of Suzaku and BeppoSAX data, in section 5 the\nEXOSAT observations of 4U 2206+54, and in section 6\nwe briefly analyze the evolutionary status of the system\nand the nature of its primary component. We conclude\nthat the primary component of the system is a neutron\nstar, which has a huge (\u223c (3 \u2212 5) \u00d7 1015 G) surface field\nand is accreting material onto its surface from a disk. In\nthis light 4U 2206+54 appears to be the first accretionpowered magnetar identified so far.\n2. ANALYSIS OF THE SUZAKU LIGHT-CURVE\n\nWe obtained an observation of 4U 2206+54 with\nSuzaku with the primary objective of searching for longperiod pulsations with the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer\n(XIS; Komaya et al. 2007). To minimize the number and\nsize of data gaps the observation was time constrained to\na phase of the space-craft precession cycle were the source\nwas always above the Earth horizon. The observation occurred 2007 May 16 to 17 (MJD 54236.176-54237.813),\nlasting for 141 ks, with a total exposure for the XIS of\n114.8 ks after filtering. A 20.9 ks duration portion of this\nobservation (MJD 54236.861-54236.110) overlaps with\nthe RXTE observations presented by Reig et al. (2009).\nThe XIS observations were taken in 1/4 window mode\nto avoid potential problems with pile-up. Our analysis\nbegan with the version 2.0.6.13 processing data (which\nhas aspect correction for thermal wobbling). The Charge\nTransfer Inefficiency (CTI) correction was remade and\n\n\f2\n\nFinger, Ikhsanov, Wilson-Hodge & Patel\n\n0.5-10 keV Rate (c s-1)\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n-0.5\n\n0.0\nTime (days past MDJ 54237.0)\n\n0.5\n\nFig. 1.- light-curve of 4U 2206+54 from Suzaku XIS (XIS0, XIS1 and XIS3 summed) in the 0.5 to 10 keV energy band.\n\nbution of the natural log of the rate, which has a more\nsymmetric distribution which is closer to a Gaussian.\nFor a more realistic null hypothesis we will assume that\nthe natural log of the flux is Gaussian noise, with a power\nspectrum of the form\nS(f ) = s0 f0\u0393 (f 2 + \u03b12 )\u2212\u0393/2\n\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n\n2.1.

For 4U 2206+54 the assumption of Gaussian white\nnoise is inappropriate. Reig et al. (2009) show that the\npower spectra of the flux in the 2-20 keV band are powerlaws above 1 mHz, with an index between 1.5 and 1.9.\nThe light curve in Figure 1 shows both short term flaring and strong long period (\u223c day) variability, suggesting\nthis red noise spectra extends to lower frequencies. In addition to the power-spectrum not being white, the distribution of the rates is far from being Gaussian. In the top\npanel of Figure 2 we show the distribution of the rates\nmeasured with Suzaku XIS, which is more exponentional\nthan Gaussian. In the bottom panel we show the distri-\n\n(1)\n\nwhere s0 , \u03b1 and \u0393 are adjustable constants and f0 is a\nfixed reference frequency. The covariance of the natural\n\nNumber per Bin\n\nthe event data cleaned using the standard filtering with\nthe exception that the lower bound on the day side earth\nlimb elevation was reduced from 20 degrees to 17.5 degrees (which did not appear to increase the broad-band\nbackground). Events were selected from the active telescopes (XIS0, XIS1, and XIS3) using 208\u2032\u2032 x 261\u2032\u2032 rectangular extraction regions centered on the source, with\nthe long axis aligned with the 1/4 window. As a limit\non the background, events were also extracted from each\ntelescope in regions of the same area as distant as possible from the source. The average rate summed over the\ntelescopes was 13.9 c s\u22121 for the source regions and 0.125\nc s\u22121 for the background regions.\nThe XIS light-curve in the 0.5-10.0 keV range with\n\u223c 200 s binning is shown in Figure 1. In order to avoid\na loss of data, unequal bins sizes were used. Each goodtime interval was divided into equal width bins, with the\nnumber of bins chosen to result in the bin width closest\nto 200 s. There appears to be pulsation with a period\nnear 0.06 days, which is most evident in the spacing of\nthe minima. Also evident is strong variablity at much\nlonger timescales.\n\n30\n20\n10\n0\n1.0\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\nFig. 2.- Distribution of the Suzaku XIS count rate (top panel),\nand of its natural log (bottom panel).\n\n\fSpin-down of 4U 2206+54\n\n3\n\n25\n\nlogs of rates k and l is then\nZ \u221e\n2\nVkl = \u03c3k \u03b4kl +\nS(f )sinc2 (\u03c0f \u03c4 ) cos(2\u03c0f [tk \u2212tl ])df (2)\n\n20\n\nwhere \u03c3k is the error on yk = ln(rk \u00d71 s), \u03c4 is the average\nrate bin width, and the sinc2 term accounts for the effect\nof binning.

The resulting Cash statistic is\nX\nC1 =\n(yk \u2212 pk )Vkl\u22121 (yl \u2212 pl ) \u2212 ln(Det(V )) + const.

Adding first harmonic terms decreases the Cash C statistic by 9.9, which has chance\nprobability of 0.7%. Adding second harmonic terms decreases the Cash statistic an additional 11.4, which has a\nchance probability of 0.3%. Further harmonics continue\nto decrease the Cash statistic, but these decreases are\nnot individually as significant.

The\nsmooth curve in Figure 4 is the average epoch folded profile of these simulated light curves.\nIn Figure 5 we show pulse profiles obtained from the\nSuzaku XIS and HXD/PIN data. Background subtracted light-curves with 24 s resolution were made for\neach energy band and epoch folded with a period of\n5554 s. For the PIN profiles light-curves where made\nfrom the cleaned event files, with live-time correction\nbased on 144 s averages of the pseudo events. The subtracted background was from the version 2 non-X-ray\nbackground file plus the cosmic x-ray background calculated with the flat response per the recipe on the Suzaku\nData Analysis web page6 . For both XIS and PIN profiles the errors were calculated from the sample variance\nin each bin. Short flares in the data has resulted in the\nerrors being correlated between neighboring bins.\nThe modulation fraction of the profiles ([maxmin]/[max+min]) is 49% in 0.5-2.5 energy band, increasing to 55% in the 20-30 keV band. A notch at the minimum is apparent in all profiles up to 30 keV. The profile\nis symmetric at low energies, with the leading edge becoming stronger than the tailing edge at higher energies.\n6\n\nhttp::/suzaku.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/suzaku/aehp data analysis.html\n\nWe have reanalyzed the BeppoSAX observation presented by Masetti et al. (2004). The source was observed\nwith BeppoSAX on 1998 November 11. We extracted\nevents in the 1.65-10.0 keV range from the version 2\nmerged MECS 2 and 3 files obtained from the ASDC\nMulti-Mission Interactive Archive, using a 4\u2032 radius extraction circle of centered on the source. As a limit on the\nbackground, events were also extracted from an annulus\nwith the same area centered on a radius of 6\u2032 . The mean\nrate from the source region was 0.41 c s\u22121 while that\nof the background region was 0.014 c s\u22121 , with much of\nthis likely associated with the wings of the point-spread\nfunction.\nIn Figure 7 we show the MECS light-curve with \u223c 200 s\nbinning of the 1.65-10 keV events.

The highest peak has a probability of occurring by chance of 5 \u00d7 10\u22128 including the\nnumber search trials in the 0-1.0 mHz interval. From the\nlocation of the highest peak we estimate a pulse period\nof 5393 \u00b1 28s. The peak near 0.36 mHz suggests a first\nharmonic. We investigated the presence of harmonics of\nthe pulse frequency by including additional sinusoids in\nthe profile (equation 6). Adding first harmonic terms\nto the pulse profile decreases the Cash statistic by 8.3\n(1.6% chance probability). Improvements from adding\nadditional harmonics were not as significant. A period\nestimate of 5420 \u00b1 25 s is obtained from the fit including\nthe first harmonic. This and the estimated power spectra\nparameters are shown in table 1.\n4. PERIOD DETERMINATIONS USING SIMULATED\nSUZAKU AND BEPPOSAX DATA\n\nWe find small but sometimes significant differences between the periods estimated with our maximum likelihood analysis and those determined with the Lomb\nmethod. We also find differences between the period\ndetermined with the maximum likelihood method when\nharmonics are included with the fundamental in the fit\nand the period determined when only the fundamental\nis included. Here we present simulations which examine\nthe extent to which these differences are expected. Our\nsimulation method is presented in the appendix.\nIn Figure 9 we present the results of a search for pulsation in the XIS light-curve using the Lomb method\n(Lomb 1975). For the Lomb power we are using twice the\nnormalization given in Press et al. (1992). A significant\npeak is evident near 0.18 mHz. Using the assumptions\nstandard for the Lomb periodigram the chance probability of this peak to occur within the 0-1.0 mHz range due\nto noise is 2 \u00d7 10\u221231 . However these assumptions are\nnot correct, as we have discussed, and this significance is\nover-estimated. This should be compared with Figure 3.\nNote the decrease of the power of the lowest frequency\npeaks relative to the main peak using the \u2206C statistic.\nThe pulse period estimated from the peak of the Lomb\npower is 5541 \u00b1 11 s which is nearly consistent with our\n\nresult of 5554\u00b19 s using the maximum likelihood fit with\nfirst and second harmonic included. We simulated 10000\nSuzaku light curves using the same times and binning as\nthe light curve in Figure 1, and the pulse period, power\nspectra and Fourier coefficients obtained from our maximum likelihood fit for this light curve. For each we used\nthe Lomb method to estimate the pulse period. The period distribution was consistent with a Gaussian with\nmean displaced by \u22121.8 \u00b1 2 s from the simulated period\nof 5554 s, and a standard deviation of 17.6 \u00b1 1 s. So\nfor the Suzaku observations we conclude that the Lomb\nmethod is essentially unbiased, but with underestimated\nerrors. The period measured with the maximum likelihood fit including only the fundamental was consistent\nwithin error to our final result from the fit including first\nand second harmonics.\nTo perform the same investigation for BeppoSAX data,\nwe made simulated light curves with the time binning\nof the MECS light curve using the estimated parameters from the maximum likelihood fit including the first\nharmonic. Using 10000 simulated light curves we found\nthe distribution of the pulse period determined with\nthe Lomb method was Gaussian with a mean displaced\n\u221223.8 \u00b1 0.3 s from the simulated period (5420 s) and\nstandard deviation of 32 s. The period obtained using\nthe Lomb method using the actual data is displaced by\n\u221244 s from the period from our final maximum likelihood\nfit, consistent with the distribution observed in the simulations.\nThe period determined with the maximum likelhood\nfit of the BeppoSAX data using only the fundamental\nwas displaced by -27 s from the period of 5420 \u00b1 25 s determined from our final fit which included the first harmonic. Using 200 of the simulated light curves, we found\nthe distribution of the periods determined with our maximum likelihood method with only the pulse fundamental\nhad a mean displaced from the simulated period (5420 s)\nby \u221217 \u00b1 2 s and a standard deviation of 28 \u00b1 2 s.\nUsing 200 simulated BeepoSAX light curves we found\nno bias in the periods estimated with our maximum likelihood method with the fundamental and first harmonic\nincluded. However the standard deviation of the estimated periods was 28.4 \u00b1 1.4 s which larger than the\nerror (25 s) we obtained from the curvature of the Cash\nstatistic versus frequency curve for the actual data.

For the first simulation we selected a\nnumber of overlapping 9600 s data segments within each\ngapless interval and from each segment made a pulse period estimate using the Suzaku XIS rates in that segment.\nSince Reig et al. (2009) used the CLEAN method for period determination we did also. CLEAN attempts to iteratively reconstruct the Fourier amplitude spectrum of\nthe data (Roberts et al. 1987). We used CLEAN within\nthe program PERIOD version 5.0-2, distributed with the\nStarlink Software Collection. In our analysis of each segment we used 5 iterations with a loop gain of 0.2. In\nthe top panel of figure 11 we show the period from each\nsegment versus the midpoint time of the segment. The\nresults of the second simulation, which used 7400 s segments, is shown in the bottom panel. It is clear that\nthe period estimates from these short data segments vary\nwidely from the 5554 s period determined from the whole\nobservations, and that the formal errors, which do not account for the underlying red noise, grossly under estimate\nthe error distribution.\n\n5. PERIOD DETERMINATIONS FROM THE EXOSAT\n6. DISCUSSION\n\nOBSERVATIONS\n\nObservations of 4U 2206+54 where made with the\nMedium Energy (ME) proportional counters on the European Space Agency's X-ray Observatory EXOSAT.\nEXOSAT/ME observed 4U 2206+54 on three occations; 1993 August 8, 1984 December 7, and 27 June\n1985. These observations were originally presented by\nSaraswat & Apparao (1992).\nReig et al. (2009) analysed the ME standard product\nlight curves from these observations, which are available\nat HEASARC, and reported pulsation with a 5525 \u00b1 30\nperiod. In figure 10 we show the light curves for the first\nand third observation with 200 s binning. We concluded\nthat the background was not correctly subtracted for the\nstandard products light curve of the second observation,\nand therefore have not shown it.\nGiven the short durations of these light curves (9630 s,\n9400 s, and 7404 s respectively) relative to the pulse period, we do not believe a period measurement based on\nthem is reliable. To demonstrate this we have made simu16\n14\n12\n\nEstimated Period (ks)\n\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.70\n\n0.76\n\nSegment Midpoint (MJD-54237)\n\nFig. 11.- Periods determine using the CLEAN method using\nshort segments of the Suzaku XIS data. The top pannels are for\n9600 segments and the bottom pannels for 7200 s segments.\n\nWe interpret the observed X-ray pulsations of\n4U 2206+54 as due to the rotation of an accreting magnetized neutron star. An alternative interpretation, which\nwas also discussed for the 10000 s pulsations of the low\nluminosity wind-fed system 2S 0114+650 (Corbet et al.\n1999), is that the observed period originates from a pulsation of the companion BD +53\u25e6 2790. However, this\nexplanation seems less plausible because such persistent\nmodulations should be detectable in the optical photometry, but have not been reported. A mechanism for transferring the modulations to the stellar wind that results\nin a large modulation of the x-ray flux has not been advanced. In addition, the evolution of the pulse profile\nwith energy that we see in the Suzaku data would not be\nexpected.\nIs it reasonable for us to assume that such a long period accreting pulsar can be formed? The longest period\nwhich a neutron star can reach in its evolution is the\nperiod at which it emerges from the subsonic propeller\nstate (Ikhsanov 2007)\n!\u22125/7\n\u1e40c\n16/21 \u22124/21\npbr = 15000 \u03bc32 m\ns, (8)\n1015 g s\u22121\nwhere \u03bc32 and m are the dipole magnetic moment and\nmass of the neutron star in units of 1032 G cm3 , and\n2\n1.5 M\u2299, respectively. \u1e40c = \u03c0RG\n\u03c1Vrel is the mass with\nwhich a neutron star of a mass Mns interacts in a unit\ntime moving through the wind of an average density\n2\n\u03c1 with a relative velocity Vrel , and RG = 2GMns /Vrel\nis the Bondi radius. For the Suzaku observations we\nfind a 0.5 \u2212 70 keV luminosity of 4 \u00d7 1035 erg s\u22121 implying a mass accretion rate onto the stellar surface of\n\u1e40a = rns Lx /GMns \u2243 2 \u00d7 1015 g s\u22121 , assuming a distance\nof 2.6 kpc (Blay et al. 2006). The mass accretion rates\nwe inferred from published observations all fall in the\nrange of 4 \u00d7 1013 \u2212 3 \u00d7 1015 g s\u22121 , with the average near\nthe higher end. Assuming \u1e40c \u2243 \u1e40a (i.e. direct accretion scenario) and putting this to Eq. 8, one finds that\ncondition pbr & 5500 s is satisfied only if the surface field\n\n\fSpin-down of 4U 2206+54\nof the neutron star in the present epoch is B0 & 1014 G.\nAn independent estimate of the field strength can be\nfound considering the neutron star spin evolution. The\naverage rate of the spin frequency change between the\nBeppoSAX and Suzaku observations was \u03bd\u0307 = (\u22121.7 \u00b1\n0.3) \u00d7 10\u221214 Hz s\u22121 . This indicates that the average\nspin-down torque applied to the star during this time\nwas Ksd & 2\u03c0I|\u03bd\u0307|, where I is the star's moment of\ninertia. If we now adopt the canonical prescription\nfor the spin-down torque (Ksd = kt \u03bc2 /rc3 , see, e.g.\nLynden-Bell & Pringle 1974; Lipunov 1992), one finds\n\u03bc & \u03bcm , where\n\u0010 p \u0011\n\u22121/2 1/2 1/2 1/2\n\u03bcm \u2243 1032 kt\nm I45 \u03bd\u0307\u221214\nG cm3 . (9)\n5500 s\n\nHere \u03bd\u0307\u221214 = |\u03bd\u0307|/10\u221214 Hz s\u22121 , and I45 = 1045 g cm2 .\n\u00011/3\nrc = GM p2 /4\u03c0 2\nis the corotation radius of the neutron star, and kt is a dimensionless parameter limited\nto kt . 1. The value of \u03bcm represents the lower limit\nto the dipole magnetic moment of the neutron star since\nthe spin-up torque in the above calculations was assumed\nto be negligibly small. Therefore, our estimate remains\nvalid independently of whether the star between the BeppoSAX and Suzaku observations was persistently in the\naccretor state or its state was temporarily changed to the\npropeller. Thus, the 5500 s pulsations in the X-ray flux\nof 4U 2206+54 can be explained in terms of the spin period of the degenerate companion provided the neutron\nstar in this system is a magnetar whose surface field at\nthe present epoch exceeds 1014 G.\nThe modeling of 4U 2206+54 in terms of an accretionpowered magnetar suggests that the neutron star is relatively young (its age is limited to the characteristic\ntime of the supercritical magnetic field decay), with an\nextended magnetosphere (rm \u221d \u03bc4/7 ), and a relatively\nsmall area of hot polar caps at the base of the accretion\ncolumn (Ap \u221d \u03bc\u22128/7 ). However, the assumption about\nspherical geometry of the accretion flow, used for making\nthe estimates (8) and (9) encounters major difficulties in\nexplaining the mode by which the accretion flow enters\nthe magnetic field of the neutron star at the magnetospheric boundary. As first shown by Arons & Lea (1976),\nand Elsner & Lamb (1977), a steady accretion onto the\nstellar surface in this case could occur only if the X-ray\nluminosity of the pulsar meets the condition Lx > Lcr ,\nwhere\n1/4\n\n\u22121/8\n\nLcr \u2243 1037 \u03bc32 m1/2 r6\n\nerg s\u22121 .\n\n(10)\n\nHere r6 is the radius of the neutron star in units of\n106 cm. Otherwise, the interchange instabilities of the\nmagnetospheric boundary are suppressed and the entry\nrate of accretion flow into the magnetosphere is too small\nto explain the X-ray luminosity of the pulsar. The star\nin this case would appear rather as a burster than a persistent source (Lamb et al. 1977).\nIt is easy to see, however, that 4U 2206+54 does not\nmeet the above criterion. Nevertheless, it is a persistent\naccretion-powered X-ray pulsar with a relatively small\namplitude of variations in X-ray intensity. This contradiction may indicate that either the spherical accretion is realized in a settling (Narayan & Medvedev 2003;\nIkhsanov 2005) rather than direct accretion mode or the\nneutron star is accreting material from a disk.\n\n7\n\nA scenario in which the neutron star accretes material from a hot envelope in a settling mode on the\nbremsstrahlung cooling time scale implies the following\ncondition to be satisfied (Ikhsanov 2005)\n\u0014\n\u0015\ntbr (rm ) Lx rms\n\u1e40c &\n.\n(11)\ntff (rm ) GMns\nHere tff (rm ) and tbr (rm ) are the free-fall time and\nbremsstrahlung cooling time at the magnetospheric\nboundary. Using parameters of 4U 2206+54 one finds\nMc & 1017 g s\u22121 . Therefore, the persistent behavior of\nthe source can be explained in terms of the settling accretion scenario only if the strength of the wind overflowing\nthe neutron star exceeds the typical mass-transfer rate in\na binary system with a O9.5V by almost four orders of\nmagnitude (Reig et al. 2009). Currently available observations do not favor the assumption about so intensive\noutflow from the normal companion. However, if it were\nvalid the condition pbr > 5500 s could be satisfied only\nfor the surface field of the neutron star & 4 \u00d7 1015 G.\nIt is interesting that a similar value of the magnetic\nfield can be found considering a situation in which the\nneutron star accretes material from a disk. A spindown of the neutron star in this case indicates that its\nspin period is smaller than the equilibrium period, peq ,\nwhich\n\u221a is defined by equating the acceleration, Ksu =\n\u1e40 GMns rm , and deceleration, Ksd = kt \u03bc2 /rc3 , torques.\nUsing parameters of 4U 2206+54, one finds that the condition p . peq is satisfied only if the strength of the dipole\nfield at the stellar surface in the present epoch is limited\nto\n\u0010 p \u00117/6\n7/24 \u22127/12 5/6\n1/2\nG,\nB(rns ) & 3 \u00d7 1015 \u03ba0.5 kt\nm \u1e4015.3\n5500 s\n(12)\nwhere \u03ba0.5 = \u03ba/0.5 is the parameter accounting the\ngeometry of the accretion flow normalized following\nGhosh & Lamb (1978). The spin-down time scale of a\nnewly formed neutron star to a period of 5500 s under\nthese conditions is close to 5000 yr (see Eq. 20 in Ikhsanov\n2007). This exceeds the decay time of the magnetic field\nconfined to the crust of the neutron star (Colpi et al.\n2000), but is still smaller than the decay time of the\nfield permeating the core. Since the X-ray spectrum of\nthe source resembles spectra of accretion-powered pulsars one can assume that the contribution of the source\nassociated with the field decay to the system X-ray luminosity is small. The field decay time in this case can\nbe limited to\ntdec & 2 \u00d7 105 \u03bc233.3 r6\u22123 L\u22121\n35.6 yr,\n\n(13)\n\nwhich is consistent within results of Heyl & Kulkarni\n(1998), who treated the magneto-thermal evolution of\nthe star in terms of ambipolar diffusion. Here L35.6\nis the X-ray luminosity of the source express in unites\nof 4 \u00d7 1035 erg s\u22121 . The proton cyclotron feature in\nthis case is expected to be observed at the energy of\n\u223c 30 (B0 /5 \u00d7 1015 G) keV.\nIt, therefore, appears that our interpretation of the\nobserved 5500 s pulsations in terms of spin period of the\nneutron star is reasonable and suggests that the neutron star in 4U 2206+54 is a magnetar with a surface\nfield of about (3 \u2212 5) \u00d7 1015 G. A question about the\n\n\f8\n\nFinger, Ikhsanov, Wilson-Hodge & Patel\n\ngeometry of the accretion flow remains, however, open\nso far. The spherical approximation of the flow geometry can be applied only under the condition \u1e40c \u226b \u1e40a .\nOn the other hand, the observed wind velocity of the Ostar companion, Vw & 350 km s\u22121, (see Rib\u00f3 et al. 2006),\nsubstantially exceeds the upper limit to the relative velocity between the star and the wind at which the disk\nformation could be expected,\n1/4\n\n\u22121/14\n\n1/28\n\nm11/28 \u1e4015\n\n\u22121/4\n\nkm s\u22121 .\n(14)\nHere P20 is the orbital period of the system in units of\n20 days, and \u03be0.2 = \u03be/0.2 is the parameter accounting\nfor the inhomogeneities of the accretion flow, which is\nnormalized following Ruffert (1999). Nevertheless, one\ncannot exclude a presence of a fossil disk surrounding the\nmagnetosphere of the neutron star which could be formed\nat the fall-back stage of the magnetar evolutionary track\n(Woosley 1988; Ek\u015fi & Alpar 2003). Further studies of\nappearance of such a disk in a situation when the neutron\nstar rotates extremely slowly and has a huge magnetosphere could help to choose appropriate flow geometry\nand reconstruct the accretion picture in this enigmatic\nsource.\nFinally, we would like to point out here that at the\nrate \u03bd\u0307 = (\u22121.7 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10\u221214 Hz s\u22121 the pulsar would\nreach zero frequency in 300 yr, making it is unlikely that\nthis is a long-term trend. Over long time-scales windfed pulsars tend to show random-walk behavior in their\nVrel . Vcr \u2243 120 \u03be0.2 \u03bc33\n\nP20\n\nspin frequency. For 4U 2206+54 we can estimate the\nrandom walk strength as S = < (\u2206\u03bd)2 /\u2206t > \u2243 8 \u00d7\n10\u221220 Hz2 s\u22121 . For comparison Vela X-1 has a random\nwalk strength of 2 \u00d7 10\u221220 (Deeter et al. 1987). The random walk behavior must break down, and the torque\nbecome correlated at short time-scales since the spin-up\nrate \u03bd\u0307 \u223c (S/\u2206t)1/2 from wind accretion is limited by\nthat due to disk accretion at the same mass accretion\nrate. Assuming a mean mass accretion rate of 1015 g s\u22121 ,\nand a magnetic field of 1015 G, we find the spin-up rate\nmust be correlated on timescales shorter than \u223c 5 days.\nBased on the strong emission in Helium lines\nNegueruela & Reig (2001) and Blay et al. (2006) have\nproposed that the optical companion BD +53\u25e6 2790 is\nsimilar to \u03b81 Ori C, which has a oblique magnetic dipole\nwith kG surface strength which magnetically channels its\nstellar wind. If so, this long correlation timescale could\nbe related to long-term correlations in the wind speed or\ndensity associated with this magnetic channeling.\n\nM.H.F. acknowledges support from NASA grant\nNNX08AG12G.

M is chosen as the nearest integer\nto T /\u03c4 so that the integral extends to where the power is cut off by the binning effect.\nBy using\ncos(2\u03c0fj [tk \u2212 tl ]) = cos 2\u03c0fj tk cos 2\u03c0fj tl + sin 2\u03c0fj tk sin 2\u03c0fj tl\n(A2)\nequation A1 can be express as\nV = UT U\n\n(A3)\n\nwhere the matrix U has N + 2M + 1 rows and N columns, with N is the number of measurements, and T signifies\nthe matrix transpose. Explicitly U is given by\nUi,k\nUN,k\nUN +2j\u22121,k\nUN +2j,k\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n\u03c3i \u03b4i,k\n1\n[w0 S(0)\u2206f ] 2\n\nfor 0 \u2264 i < N\n1\n\n[wj S(fj )sinc2 (\u03c0fj \u03c4 )\u2206f ] 2 cos 2\u03c0fj tk for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 M\n1\n[wj S(fj )sinc2 (\u03c0fj \u03c4 )\u2206f ] 2 sin 2\u03c0fj tk for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 M\n\n(A4)\n\nBy applying a series of N orthgonal Householder transformations (reflections) U can be transformed into an N \u00d7 N\nupper triangular matrix \u0168 , while perserving equation A3 (Householder 1958). We then have\nX\nln(|\u0168ii |) ,\n(A5)\nC1 = |\u0168 \u2212T (y \u2212 p)|2 + 2\ni\n\nwith a simular expression for C0 . Here y is the vector with components yk and p is the vector with components pk .\nWe will introduce the augmented parameter vector q = [\u03bc, a, b, \u22121], and using equation 6 define the matrix H so that\n\n\fSpin-down of 4U 2206+54\n\n9\n\np \u2212 y = Hq. Then with R = \u0168 \u2212T H we have\nC1 = |Rq|2 + 2\n\nX\ni\n\nln(|\u0168ii |) ,\n\n(A6)\n\nBy applying Householder transformations R can be transformed into a 4\u00d74 upper triangular matrix R\u0303 while preserving\nequation A6. We can then minimize C1 with respect to \u03bc, a and b by setting the first three components of R\u0303q to zero\n2\nand solving for \u03bc, a and b, with the minimum of |R\u0303q|2 given by R33\n.\nWe minimize C0 and C1 with respect to the power spectral parameters s0 , a0 , and \u0393 by the downhill simplex method.\nLIGHT CURVE SIMULATIONS\n\nIn our simulations we first simulate natural log rates yk with covariance given by equation A1 with the measurement\nerrors \u03c3k set to zero, and means pk given by equation 6 (perhaps with terms for harmonics). Simulated counting\nstatistical errors are then added to the rates rk .\nAs above an upper triangular matrix \u0168 is calculated such that \u0168 T \u0168 = V . Then with x is vector of N random\nnormal varients with unit variance zero mean we calculate\nThe covariance matrix of \u03a8 is\n\n\u03a8 = \u0168 T x\n\n(B1)\n\n< \u03a8\u03a8T >= \u0168 T < xxT > \u0168 = \u0168 T \u0168 = V .\n\n(B2)\n\nThe simulated rates prior (without counting statistical errors) are given by\nrk = exp(\u03a8k + pk ) .\n\n(B3)\n\nCounting statistical errors are then simulated from these rates and the bin widths.\nREFERENCES\nArons, J., Lea, S.M. 1976, ApJ, 207, 914\nBlay, P., Rib\u00f3, M., Negueruela, I., Torrej\u00f3n, J.
