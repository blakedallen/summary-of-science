Suppose that some harmonic analysis arguments have been\ninvoked to show that the indicator function of a set of residue classes\nmodulo some integer has a large Fourier coefficient. To get information about the structure of the set of residue classes, we then need a\ncertain type of complementary result. A solution to this problem was\ngiven by Gregory Freiman in 1961, when he proved a lemma which\nrelates the value of an exponential sum with the distribution of summands in semi-circles of the unit circle in the complex plane. Since\nthen, Freiman's Lemma has been extended by several authors. Rather\nthan residue classes, one has considered the situation for finitely many\narbitrary points on the unit circle. So far, Lev is the only author who\nhas taken into consideration that the summands may be bounded away\nfrom each other, as is the case with residue classes. In this paper we\nextend Lev's result by lifting a recent result of ours to the case of the\npoints being bounded away from each other.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn additive combinatorics, and in additive combinatorial number theory\nin particular, situations of the following type are rather common. Let A be a\nset of N residue classes modulo an integer m. Suppose that some harmonic\nanalysis arguments have been invoked to show that the indicator function\nof A has a large Fourier coefficient; i.e.,\nmax\n\n06=x\u2208Z/mZ\n\n|b\n1A (x)| \u2265 \u03b1N\n\nfor some \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1]. Following Green [1], or see Tao and Vu [13], we might\nsay that A has \"Fourier bias\". Using this information one wishes to conclude that A has \"combinatorial bias\"; perhaps integer representatives of\nDate: October 18, 2018.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 11J71, 11K36, 11T23.\nKey words and phrases. Exponential sums, unit circle, distribution, arcs.\n1\n\n\f2\n\n\u00d8. J. R\u00d8DSETH\n\nthe residue classes in some affine image of A concentrates on some interval. For this we then need tight upper bounds for the absolute values of\nthe exponential sums b\n1A (x). Now, the basic idea is that the absolute value\nof an exponential sum is small if the terms are, in some sense, uniformly\ndistributed. The case m prime was applied by Freiman [2, 3] in the proof of\nhis \"2.4-theorem\". A proof of this theorem is presented in both Freiman's\nclassical monograph [4] and in Mel Nathanson's beautiful book [9].\nFreiman [2, 3], Postnikova [10], Moran and Pollington [8], Lev [5, 6], and\nR\u00f8dseth [11, 12] considered the situation in which one has finitely many arbitrary points on the unit circle in the complex plane, rather than a subset\nof Z/mZ. In possible applications the points on the unit circle will sometimes be bounded away from each other, like, for instance, if we are looking\nat a subset of Z/mZ. If we add the condition that the points should be\nbounded away from each other, we could hope for sharper results. Indeed,\nby adding this assumption, Lev sharpened Freiman's Lemma to (2) below.\nLev's result [5, Theorem 2] seems, however, to be the only result in the\nliterature addressing this issue. In this paper we prove a result which extends both Lev's result about points being bounded away from each other,\nand our main result in [11, 12], where we did not take this property into\nconsideration.\nFirst, we shall, however, present a version of Freiman's Lemma. We\ninclude two different proofs in the hope of giving the reader an impression\nof two recent techniques used in the search and study of results related to\nFreiman's Lemma.\n2. Three Theorems\nIn the following, n, N , \u03ba, and k are non-negative or positive integers. We\nwrite U for the unit circle in the complex plane; that is,\nU := {z \u2208 C : |z| = 1}.\nAn empty sum is taken as zero.\nWe now state Freiman's Lemma [2, 3].\nTheorem 1 (Freiman's Lemma). Suppose that the complex numbers z1 , . . . , zN \u2208\nU have the property that any open semi-circle of U contains at most n of\nthem. Then\n(1)\n\n|z1 + * * * + zN | \u2264 2n \u2212 N.\n\n\fEXPONENTIAL SUMS\n\n3\n\nThe complex numbers z1 , . . . , zN are not necessarily all distinct. The\nassumptions of the lemma imply that N \u2264 2n, and the result is sharp in the\nrange n \u2264 N \u2264 2n. That is, for every n and N satisfying these inequalities,\nthere exist sequences z1 , . . . , zN with zj \u2208 U, such that the hypotheses are\nsatisfied and |z1 +* * *+zN | meets the bound 2n\u2212N . In this sense, Freiman's\nLemma is best possible. The result has, however, been extended by Moran\nand Pollington [8], Lev [5, 6], and by R\u00f8dseth [11, 12].\nThe next theorem is Lev's sharpening of Freiman's Lemma at the expense of requiring the points to be bounded away from each other. Lev [5,\nTheorem 2] proved the following theorem.\nTheorem 2 (Lev). Let \u03b4 \u2208 (0, \u03c0] satisfy n\u03b4 \u2264 \u03c0. Suppose that the complex\nnumbers z1 , . . . , zN \u2208 U have the following two properties:\n(a) any open semi-circle of U contains at most n of them;\n(ii) any open arc of U of length \u03b4 contains at most one of them.\nThen\n(2)\n\n|z1 + * * * + zN | \u2264\n\nsin((2n \u2212 N )\u03b4/2)\n.\nsin(\u03b4/2)\n\nSo, by introducing the condition (ii), Lev reduced Freiman's bound 2n\u2212N\nin (1) to the bound in (2), a refinement that, according to Lev, was crucial\nin [7]. The result is sharp for n \u2264 N \u2264 2n. By letting \u03b4 \u2192 0+ in Lev's\nresult, we recover Freiman's Lemma.\nIn this paper we shall prove the following theorem.\nTheorem 3. Let \u03b4, \u03c6 \u2208 (0, \u03c0] satisfy n\u03b4 \u2264 \u03c6. Suppose that the complex\nnumbers z1 , . . . , zN \u2208 U have the following two properties:\n(i) any open arc of U of length \u03c6 contains at most n of them;\n(ii) any open arc of U of length \u03b4 contains at most one of them.\nLet N = \u03ban + r, 1 \u2264 r \u2264 n, and assume that (\u03ba + 1)\u03c6 \u2264 2\u03c0. Then we have\n(3)\nsin(r\u03b4/2) sin((\u03ba + 1)\u03c6/2) sin((n \u2212 r)\u03b4/2) sin(\u03ba\u03c6/2)\n|z1 + * * * + zN | \u2264\n*\n+\n*\n.\nsin(\u03b4/2)\nsin(\u03c6/2)\nsin(\u03b4/2)\nsin(\u03c6/2)\nNotice that \u03ba = \u2308N/n\u2309 \u2212 1. Also notice that we do need some condition\nlike (\u03ba + 1)\u03c6 \u2264 2\u03c0, to be certain that there is room enough on U to place N\npoints such that they satisfy the other conditions set in the theorem. This\ncondition can also be written as N \u2264 \u230a2\u03c0/\u03c6\u230bn.\nThe restriction n\u03b4 \u2264 \u03c6 is no problem. For if n\u03b4 \u2265 \u03c6, then (i) follows from\n(ii) and can be omitted. Now, |z1 + * * * + zN | attains its maximum on any\n\n\f4\n\n\u00d8. J.

Lev [6].\n3. Two Proofs of Freiman's Lemma\nFor real numbers \u03b1 < \u03b2, the set of z \u2208 U satisfying \u03b1 < arg z \u2264 \u03b2 for\nsome value of arg z, is an open-closed arc. In Freiman's Lemma one often\nassumes that any open-closed (or closed-open) semi-circle of U contains at\nmost n of the points zj , instead of taking open semi-circles; cf. [4], [9]. It is,\nhowever, easy to see that the two variants of the hypotheses are equivalent;\ncf. Section 4.2 below.\nFreiman's proof of Theorem 1 was simplified by Postnikova [10], and it\nis this proof we find in the books [4] and [9]. Here, we shall present two\nother proofs in an attempt to give the reader a pleasant introduction to\ntwo techniques recently employed in the quest for extensions of Freiman's\nLemma. The two proofs are rather different. One proof can be characterized\nas topological-combinatorial or as a perturbation method, and is due to Lev\n(extracted from the proof of [5, Theorem 2]). The other proof uses properties\nof a certain Fourier coefficient, and is independently due to Lev and the\npresent author.\n\n\fEXPONENTIAL SUMS\n\n5\n\n3.1. First Proof. Assume that Freiman's Lemma is false. We consider\nthe smallest N for which there exists an N -term sequence which satisfies\nthe hypotheses, but violates (1). Then N > 1. By considering open semicircles, the set of N -term sequences satisfying the hypotheses form a closed\nsubset of the compact topological space UN , and is itself compact. By the\ncontinuity of the function z1 , . . . , zN 7\u2192 |S|, where S := z1 + * * * + zN ,\nwe thus have that |S| attains a maximum value on some N -term sequence\nZ := z1 , . . . , zN , which satisfies the hypotheses. Then |S| > 2n \u2212 N . A\nrotation of Z shows that we may assume that S is real and non-negative.\nSuppose that there is a z 6= 1 in Z. By symmetry, we may assume that\nArg z < 0, using the interval [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0) for the principal argument. Replacing\nz by z exp(i\u03b5) for a small \u03b5 > 0, we get an increase in |S|. Thus the replacement results in violation of the hypotheses in Freiman's Lemma. The only\npossibility is that the replacement produces an open semi-circle with more\nthan n points from Z; hence \u2212z also belongs to Z.\nWe now remove \u00b1z from Z. This gives us a sequence Z \u2032 satisfying the\nhypotheses, and with parameters N \u2032 = N \u2212 2 and n\u2032 = n \u2212 1. Denoting the\nsum of the terms of Z \u2032 by S \u2032 , we have by the minimality of N ,\nS = S \u2032 \u2264 2n\u2032 \u2212 N \u2032 = 2n \u2212 N,\na contradiction. Thus all terms of Z are equal to 1, and N = S > 2n \u2212 N .\nBut a semi-circle containing 1 contains N terms from Z; hence n \u2265 N , and\nagain we have a contradiction.\n\n3.2. Second Proof. Assume that z1 , . . . , zN satisfy the hypotheses. We\nshall prove (1), and can without loss of generality assume that S is real and\nnon-negative. Let K(\u03b8) denote the number of values j \u2208 [1, N ] such that\n\u03b8 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2264 arg zj < \u03b8 for some value of arg zj . Then we have\n(5)\n\nK(\u03b8) + K(\u03b8 + \u03c0) = N,\n\nso that N \u2212 n \u2264 K(\u03b8) \u2264 n.\nMoreover,\nZ\n\n\u03c0\n\nK(\u03b8) sin \u03b8 d\u03b8 =\n\u2212\u03c0\n\nN Z\nX\nj=1\n\narg zj +\u03c0\n\nsin \u03b8 d\u03b8 = 2S,\narg zj\n\n\f6\n\n\u00d8.

If the sequence Z \u2208 UN satisfies the assumptions of Theorem 3\nfor a certain value of n, we say that Z is an (N, n)-admissible sequence.\nWe use the interval [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0) for the principal argument Arg z of a non-zero\ncomplex number z.\n4.2. Arcs. An arc (u, v), where u, v \u2208 U, consists of the points we pass in\nmoving counter-clockwise from u to v. Almost all arcs in this paper have\nlengths at most 2\u03c0. In spite of the similarity of notation, an arc cannot be\nconfused with a real interval.\nConsider the two statements\n(i) any open arc of U of length \u03c6 contains at most n of the points zj ;\n(i\u2032 ) any open-closed arc of U of length \u03c6 contains at most n of the points\nzj .\nClearly, (i\u2032 ) implies (i). On the other hand, if (i\u2032 ) fails, then (i) fails. For if\nan open-closed arc (u, u exp(i\u03c6)], u \u2208 U, of U contains n + 1 of the points zj ,\nthen, for a sufficiently small real \u03b5 > 0, the open arc (u exp(i\u03b5), u exp(i\u03c6+i\u03b5))\ncontains the same n + 1 points. Thus (i) and (i\u2032 ) are equivalent. (And the\nreason is, of course, that we only consider finitely many points zj .)\n4.3. Assumptions. The two bounds (3) and (4) coincide for n\u03b4 = \u03c6. For\nthe proof of Theorem 3 we may therefore assume that n\u03b4 < \u03c6. Moreover,\nwe observe that the right-hand side of (3) is continuous as a function of \u03c6\non the real interval (n\u03b4, 2\u03c0/(\u03ba + 1)]. Hence it suffices to prove the assertion\nof Theorem 3 in the case \u03c6 < 2\u03c0/(\u03ba + 1).\n\n\fEXPONENTIAL SUMS\n\n7\n\nWe shall prove Theorem 3 by contradiction. We therefore assume the\ntheorem false. Choose the smallest non-negative integer N for which there\nexists an n such that (3) fails for some (N, n)-admissible sequence. Then\nN > 1.\n4.4. Geometric Progressions. A geometric progression \u2206 in U with ratio\n\u03c12 is called a \u03b4-progression. If we write this progression as\n(6)\n\nu\u03c1r\u22121\u22122j ,\n\nj = 0, . . . , r \u2212 1,\n\nfor some u \u2208 U, then \u2206 is a progression of length r, centered around u. The\npoint u may, or may not, belong to the progression. The point u\u03c1r\u22121 is the\nfirst and u\u03c1\u2212(r\u22121) is the end point (element, term) of the progression. If we\nmultiply each term of \u2206 by v \u2208 U, we get a new \u03b4-progression denoted \u2206v.\nIf all terms of \u2206 belong to Z, we say that \u2206 is in Z. The \u03b4-progression (6)\nis maximal in Z, if the progression is in Z, but neither u\u03c1r+1 nor u\u03c1\u2212r\u22121\nbelongs to Z.\nNotice that if \u2206 is a \u03b4-progression in Z of length r, then r \u2264 n. The\nreason is the inequality n\u03b4 < \u03c6, and that an open arc of U of length \u03c6\ncontains at most n points from Z.\n4.5. Compactness. The arcs in both (i) and (ii) are open. Therefore, by\na standard compactness argument, |S| attains a maximum on the set of\n(N, n)-admissible sequences. Let the maximum be attained at the (N, n)admissible sequence Z := z1 , . . . , zN . A rotation of Z shows that we may\nassume that the matching S = z1 + * * * + zN is real and non-negative.\n4.6. Dispersion. Recall that N > 1 and N = \u03ban + r, 1 \u2264 r \u2264 n. Suppose\nthat Z is a \u03b4-progression. The length of this \u03b4-progression is N .\nIf \u03ba = 0, then\nsin(r\u03b4/2)\n,\n|z1 + * * * + zN | \u2264\nsin(\u03b4/2)\nand (3) holds, contrary to hypothesis. Thus N \u2265 n + 1, and there is a\nclosed arc of U of length n\u03b4 containing n + 1 of the points zj . But we have\nn\u03b4 < \u03c6, so this contradicts condition (i) of Theorem 3. Therefore Z is not\na \u03b4-progression.\n4.7. Perturbation. We have just seen that Z is not a \u03b4-progression. This\nimplies that there exists at least one point z \u2208 Z, z 6= 0, such that Arg z > 0\nand z\u03c1\u22122 6\u2208 Z, or Arg z < 0 and z\u03c12 6\u2208 Z. Choose such a z, as close to \u22121\n\n\f8\n\n\u00d8. J. R\u00d8DSETH\n\nas possible. By symmetry, we can assume that Arg z < 0. We split this case\ninto the two cases determined by (7) and (8) below.\n4.7.1. Case I. First, we assume that there is an integer \u03bb in the interval\n1 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 \u03ba satisfying\n(\u03bb \u2212 1)\u03c6\n\u03bb\u03c6\n\u2264 Arg z < \u2212\n.\n2\n2\nThe length of the shortest arc (z, z \u2032 ) for z 6= z \u2032 \u2208 Z is at least \u03b4. Since\nz\u03c12 6\u2208 Z, the arc (z, z \u2032 ) has length greater than \u03b4. We start the perturbation\nprocedure by performing a small counter-clockwise rotation of z along the\nunit circle; that is, we replace z by z exp(i\u03b5) for a small \u03b5 > 0. If \u03b5 is\nsufficiently small, then the length of the open arc (z exp(i\u03b5), z \u2032 ) is still at\nleast \u03b4, and the rotation of z does not disturb the truth of (ii). Since\nArg z < 0, there will, however, be an increase in |S|. Thus the rotation\nviolates (i\u2032 ). Therefore we have z\u03c9 2 \u2208 Z, and the open-closed arc (z, z\u03c9 2 ]\ncontains exactly n terms from Z. If z\u03c9 2 \u03c12 \u2208 Z then the arc (z\u03c12 , z\u03c9 2 \u03c12 ]\ncontains n + 1 points of Z. Therefore z\u03c9 2 \u03c12 6\u2208 Z.\nNext, we perform a small rotation of both the points z and z\u03c9 2 simultaneously and counter-clockwise along the unit circle. We have\n\u03c6\nArg(z + z\u03c9 2 ) = Arg z + ,\n2\nand if \u03bb \u2265 2, the rotation makes |S| increase. Hence z\u03c9 4 \u2208 Z. We also see\nthat z\u03c9 4 \u03c12 6\u2208 Z, and that the arc (z\u03c9 2 , z\u03c9 4 ] contains exactly n terms from\nZ.\nUsing the right inequality in (7), we find for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 \u03bb, that\n!\nj\u22121\nX\n(j \u2212 1)\u03c6\n(\u03bb \u2212 j)\u03c6\n2l\n= Arg z +\nArg\nz\u03c9\n<\u2212\n\u2264 0.\n2\n2\n(7)\n\n\u2212\n\nl=0\n\nThis shows that we may continue the perturbation process until we eventually obtain\nz\u03c9 2j \u2208 Z\n\nand\n\nz\u03c9 2j \u03c12 6\u2208 Z\n\nfor\n\nj = 0, 1, . . . , \u03bb.\n\nIn addition, for j = 1, 2, . . . , \u03bb, each arc (z\u03c9 2(j\u22121) , z\u03c9 2j ] contains exactly n\npoints from Z.\nBy the left inequality in (7), we have\nArg(z\u03c9 2\u03bb ) \u2265 \u2212Arg z.\nUsing the definition of z, it follows that if we start at the point z\u03c9 2\u03bb \u03c12 ,\nwhich is in U but not in Z, and move counter-clockwise on U, then the first\n\n\fEXPONENTIAL SUMS\n\n9\n\npoint in Z we meet, is the end point of a maximal \u03b4-progression in Z with\nz as its first element.\nThe open-closed arc (z, z\u03c9 2\u03bb ] contains \u03bbn points from Z, and in addition\nwe have r \u2032 \u2265 1 points in the maximal \u03b4-progression in Z with z as first\npoint. Thus we have\n\u03bbn + r \u2032 = N = \u03ban + r,\n\n1 \u2264 r \u2032 , r \u2264 n,\n\nso that \u03bb = \u03ba and r \u2032 = r. This completes the first case (7).\n4.7.2. Case II. Second, if z does not satisfy (7) for \u03bb = \u03ba, then\n\u03ba\u03c6\n(8)\n\u2212 \u03c0 \u2264 Arg z < \u2212 ,\n2\nand we can do one more step in the perturbation process. By the inequality\n(\u03ba + 1)\u03c6 < 2\u03c0, we have that the arc (z, z\u03c9 2(\u03ba+1) ] contains exactly (\u03ba + 1)n\npoints from Z. In addition, we have the point z itself. Thus we have found\n(\u03ba + 1)n + 1 points in Z. Since Z contains at most (\u03ba + 1)n points, we have\na contradiction. Thus there are no points in Z satisfying (8).\n4.8. Primary Points. For the z \u2208 Z defined at the beginning of Section 4.7, we now know that for j = 1, 2, . . . , \u03ba, each open-closed arc (z\u03c9 2(j\u22121) , z\u03c9 2j ]\ncontains exactly n points from Z. In addition, there is the maximal \u03b4progression \u2206 of length r with z as first element. This accounts for all\nelements in Z.\nThus we have\nz\u03c9 2j \u2208 Z,\n\nj = 0, 1, . . . , \u03ba.\n\nSuppose that z\u03c1\u22122 \u2208 \u2206. The open-closed arc (z, z\u03c9 2 ] contains exactly n\npoints from Z. If z\u03c9 2 \u03c1\u22122 6\u2208 Z, then the closed-open arc [z\u03c1\u22122 , z\u03c9 2 \u03c1\u22122 )\ncontains n + 1 points from Z, contrary to hypotheses. Thus z\u03c9 2 \u03c1\u22122 \u2208 Z.\nContinuing in the same manner, we get (with a slight abuse of notation)\n\u2206\u03c9 2 \u2286 Z. Repeating the argument, we ultimately obtain,\n\u2206\u03c9 2j \u2286 Z\n\nfor j = 0, 1, . . . , \u03ba.\n\nNotice that for j \u2265 1, the \u03b4-progression \u2206\u03c9 2j is not necessarily maximal.\nWe set\n\u03ba\n[\n\u2206\u03c9 2j .\nZ1 =\nj=0\n\nThen N1 := |Z1 | = \u03bar + r. We write S1 for the sum of all elements in Z1 ,\nand we want to find an upper bound for |S1 |. (We may have N1 = N , so we\n\n\f10\n\n\u00d8. J. R\u00d8DSETH\n\ncannot use (3).) We can, however, easily determine the exact value of |S1 |,\n(9)\n\n|S1 | =\n\nr\u22121\nX\n\n\u03c1\u22122l\n\nl=0\n\n\u03ba\nX\n\nz\u03c9 2j =\n\nj=0\n\nsin(r\u03b4/2) sin((\u03ba + 1)\u03c6/2)\n*\n.\nsin(\u03b4/2)\nsin(\u03c6/2)\n\nIf \u03ba = 0 or r = n, then Z = Z1 , and by (9), Eq. (3) holds, contrary to\nhypothesis. Thus we have \u03ba \u2265 1 and 1 \u2264 r < n.\n4.9. Secondary Points. We set\nZ2 = Z \\ Z1 ,\nand put N2 = |Z2 |. Then N2 = (\u03ba \u2212 1)(n \u2212 r) + (n \u2212 r). We have that Z2\nis (N2 , n \u2212 r)-admissible, and since N2 < N , we can use (3). Writing S2 for\nthe sum of the terms in Z2 , we obtain\n(10)\n\n|S2 | \u2264\n\nsin((n \u2212 r)\u03b4/2) sin(\u03ba\u03c6/2)\n*\n.\nsin(\u03b4/2)\nsin(\u03c6/2)\n\nWe have\nS \u2264 |S1 | + |S2 |,\nand (9) and (10) show that (3) holds; again we have reached a contradiction.\nThis concludes the proof of Theorem 3.\n5. Closing Remarks\nWe can also state Theorem 3 in a slightly different way.\nTheorem 4. Let \u03b4, \u03c6 \u2208 (0, \u03c0] satisfy n\u03b4 \u2264 \u03c6. Assume that the complex numbers z1 , . . . , zN \u2208 U have the two properties (i) and (ii) stated in Theorem 3.\nThen we have\n(11) |z1 + * * * + zN | \u2264\n\nsin((N \u2212 (k \u2212 1)n)\u03b4/2) sin(k\u03c6/2)\n*\nsin(\u03b4/2)\nsin(\u03c6/2)\nsin((kn \u2212 N )\u03b4/2) sin((k \u2212 1)\u03c6/2)\n+\n*\n,\nsin(\u03b4/2)\nsin(\u03c6/2)\n\nfor any positive integer k \u2264 2\u03c0/\u03c6.\nDenote the right-hand side of (11) by Lk . We easily see that\n\u0012\n\u0013\nsin((kn \u2212 N )\u03b4/2) sin(k\u03c6/2)\n\u03c6\nn\u03b4\nLk+1 \u2212 Lk = 2\n*\n\u2212 cos\ncos\n,\nsin(\u03b4/2)\nsin(\u03c6/2)\n2\n2\nso that\nL1 \u2265 . . . \u2265 L\u2308N/n\u2309 \u2264 L\u2308N/n\u2309+1 \u2264 . . . \u2264 L\u230a2\u03c0/\u03c6\u230b .\n\n\fEXPONENTIAL SUMS\n\n11\n\nThus Lk attains its minimum at k = \u2308N/n\u2309 (and also at k = N/n + 1 if\nn divides N ). Therefore Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 are essentially one and\nthe same.\nNow, by letting \u03b4 \u2192 0+ , we recover the main result of [11, 12].\nThe following direct extension of Theorem 2 is an immediate consequence\nof Theorem 4.\nCorollary 1. Let k \u2265 2 be an integer, and let \u03b4 \u2208 (0, \u03c0] satisfy n\u03b4 \u2264 2\u03c0/k.\nSuppose that the complex numbers z1 , . . . , zN \u2208 U have the following two\nproperties:\n(b) any open arc of U of length 2\u03c0/k contains at most n of them;\n(ii) any open arc of U of length \u03b4 contains at most one of them.\nThen\n|z1 + * * * + zN | \u2264\n\nsin((kn \u2212 N )\u03b4/2)\n.\nsin(\u03b4/2)\n\nIf k is even, then Corollary 1 is an easy consequence of Theorem 2. This\ndoes not seem to be the case for k odd. Corollary 1 is sharp for (k \u2212 1)n \u2264\nN \u2264 kn. By letting \u03b4 \u2192 0+ , we recover the result of Moran and Pollington\n[8].\nFor applications, one would perhaps, although not always necessary, turn\nthe upper bound for |z1 + * * * + zN | into a lower bound for the number of\nterms zj in at least one open arc of U of length \u03c6.\nIn closing, let us consider such a lower bound for the residue class situation\nmentioned in the introduction. Then we have an N -set A of residue classes\nmodulo an integer m > 1. Set \u03b4 = 2\u03c0/m, and put \u03c6 = 2\u03c0/k for some integer\nk \u2265 2.\nLet\nX\nb\n1A (1) =\nexp(2\u03c0ia/m).\na\u2208A\n\nBy Corollary 1, there exist integers u, v satisfying u \u2264 v < u + m/k such\nthat the image of the interval [u, v] under the canonical homomorphism\nZ \u2192 Z/mZ contains n0 elements of A, where\n!'\n&\n1A (1)| sin(\u03c0/m))\nArcsin(|b\n1\nN+\n;\nn0 \u2265\nk\n\u03c0/m\ncf.
