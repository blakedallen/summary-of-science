We\nargue, however, that a physical observer can not reach the mirror region in a finite proper time.\nSelf-similar collapse/expansion of these fields are also briefly discussed.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nRecently some authors have discussed scalar fields with\nnegative kinetic energies (NKE) [1, 2, 3]. In [1] the authors have studied these fields in connection to the dark\nmatter problem in the universe. Also, since observational\nevidence does not exclude cosmological models with the\npressure to density ratio < \u22121, various models with negative densities were studied recently by several groups\n[4].\nIn [2], to motivate these studies, it was argued that\none may find several physical examples, such as Lifshitz\ntransitions in condensed matter physics or an unusual\ndispersion relation for rotons in liquid helium, suggesting that the NKE may appear in nature. Also, negative\nenergy densities may appear in quantum particle creation processes in curved backgrounds [5] or in squeezed\nstates of the electromagnetic fields [6]. Their appearance,\nhowever, signals usually the unhealthy vacuum instability. Therefore, if the time scale of this instability is too\nshort, the matter cannot serve as viable candidate for\nthe dark energy component [1]. A different reasoning towards NKE, however, may be applied if one approaches\nthe cosmological singularity problem.\nOne believes that the emergence of spacetime singularities in General Relativity suggests the breakdown of\nthe theory at its natural scales. At these scales one expects the quantum corrections to take a leading role and\nsave the situation. Different approaches to regularize the\nsingularity have been undertaken. Phenomenologically,\nand in the light of all the standard singularity theorems,\nwhat appears to be the simplest way to tackle the singularity problem is to allow for negative energy densities,\nand probably some degree of anisotropy and/or inhomogeneity. This would produce the repulsive gravity effects\nand may smoothen the singularity. Phenomenologically,\nagain, one can associate the negative energy densities\nwith the back reaction of the quantum fluctuations, so\nthat the idea in itself is not that ridiculous. Thus, allow-\n\ning for NKE may prove to be an interesting approach to\nspacetime singularities in General Relativity. Here, the\nproblem of the vacuum instability should be irrelevant,\nand even may become a blessing, for if these exotic fields\ndecay rapidly, after having smoothed the singularity, this\nwell could be a reason as to why we live in a ghost-free\nworld. Consequently, it is worthwhile to have a closer\nlook at some geometries produced by such fields, and we\nsuggest here that one should keep her/his eyes wide open,\njust in case.\nWe will be especially interested in dynamical spacetimes in this setting, some static solutions in the ghost\nsector were presented elsewhere [2, 7]. Just to concentrate on the simplest examples we consider the energymomentum tensor of a massless scalar field in the following form,\nT\u03bc\u03bd = \u01eb(2\u03c6,\u03bc \u03c6,\u03bd \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd \u03c6,\u03b1 \u03c6,\u03b1 ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhich is derived from the Lagrangian\nL = R \u2212 2\u01eb\u03c6,\u03b1 \u03c6,\u03b1 ,\n\n(2)\n\nand where \u03c6 is a scalar, R is the Ricci scalar and \u01eb may\ntake values 1 and \u22121. Our metric signature convention is\n(\u2212, +, +, +). When \u01eb = 1, the energy-momentum tensor\nis of a standard form, while \u01eb = \u22121 stands for the ghost\nfield.\n\nHOMOGENEOUS ANISOTROPIC MODELS\n\nOur starting point is the family of Kantowski-Sachs\nmetrics. We choose these space-times because they combine both the non-trivial curvature as well as the effects of\nanisotropy. We should note, moreover, that we couldn't\nfind any other non-pathological, dynamical homogeneous\nand isotropic spacetime with the ghost fields.\nWith the energy-momentum tensor given by (1) we\nfind the following formal solution to the Einstein field\n\n\f2\nequations,\n\n\u0398\n\n2\u03b7\n2\u03b7\n\u2212 k)\u2212\u03b1 dt2 + (\n\u2212 k)\u03b1 dr2\nt\nt\n2\u03b7\n+t2 ( \u2212 k)1\u2212\u03b1 (d\u03b82 + fk (\u03b8)2 d\u03c6),\nt\n\nds2 = \u2212(\n\nwith the scalar field given by\nr\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\u03b7\n1 1 \u2212 \u03b12\nlog\n\u2212k .\n\u03c6(t) =\n2\n\u01eb\nt\nHere k is spatial curvature (k = \u22121, 0, 1), and\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 sin \u03b8 k = 1,\nk = 0,\nfk (\u03b8) = \u03b8\n\uf8f3\nsinh \u03b8 k = \u22121.\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\nFIG. 1: Volume expansion of nonsingular universe\n\n(5)\n\n\u2022 k=1\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + dr2 \u2212 (\u03b7 2 + t2 )(d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ), (6)\n\u0010\u03b7\u0011\n,\n\u03c6(t) = arctan\nt\n\u2022 k = \u22121\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + dr2 + (\u03b7 2 + t2 )(d\u03b82 + sinh2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ), (7)\n\u0010\u03b7\u0011\n\u03c6(t) = arctan\n.\nt\nThe solution (6) is just the Gibbons-Rasheed's massless\n\"ghost\" wormhole [7] with t now being the spacelike and\nr the timelike co-ordinates. The solution (7), however,\nrepresents a non-singular anisotropic universe with open\nspatial sections. Its volume expansion \u0398 is :\n2t\n.\n\u03b7 2 + t2\n\n\u03c3 = \u2212\u221a\n3(\u03b7 2 + t2 )\n\nThe non-singular universe is flat and static as t \u2192 \u2212\u221e,\nwith the vanishing scalar field. It collapses towards a\nflat universe at t = 0, where the scalar stabilizes to a\nconstant, and then expands again to a flat universe as\nt \u2192 \u221e, with the vanishing scalar field. The solution (7)\nis definitely too crude to represent even a toy cosmology.\nBut imagine, that the massless scalar field with the NKE\nis supplemented by an ordinary matter, or by a potential\nas in [1]. Then, it may be possible that the evolution\nof the model at different stages is dominated by either\nthe ghost field or by ordinary matter. Near the singularity, the kinetic terms always dominate the potential,\nand therefore the short period of the ghost domination\nmay give rise to a regular solution. There could also be\nsituations where both ingredients will just conspire to\nproduce a cosmological constant, as in [2], during some\nepoch. Such a model could then be an interesting test\nbench to address the singularity, inflation and the coincidence problem at one go. The realistic model building,\nhowever, is far beyond the scope of the present paper.\nIn a different setting, one can make a connection between the solution (7) and the singularity problem in low\nenergy string cosmology. The related models are those of\nthe pre-Big Bang scenario (for a review see, [9, 10]). One\nof the main difficulties in these models is the smooth exit\nfrom the pre-Big Bang into the post-Big Bang regime.\nThe possibilities of the smooth transitions in the context\nof the lowest-order effective string action were discussed\nin [11]. There it was concluded that the transitional singularities at t = 0 can be avoided for anisotropic backgrounds provided one accepts the sources with negative\nenergy densities. The solution (7) therefore represents an\nexact evolution of such a model near t = 0.\n\n(8)\nINHOMOGENEOUS SOLUTIONS\n\nThe volume deformation reads:\nt\n\n+\n\nt\n\nNow, for \u01eb = 1 and |\u03b1| < 1, we recover the usual Einsteindilaton solution given, for example, in [8].\nWhen \u01eb = \u22121 one must continue the scalar field analytically in order to finish with a real field and a nonpathological metric. In this case one may obtain real\nsolutions simply by considering the case |\u03b1| > 1. When\n\u03b1 = 0, however, we must continue analytically the log\nfunction. It follows, thus, that it is only possible to obtain real solutions in the homogeneous case when k 6= 0.\nOn the other hand, when certain amount of inhomogeneity is introduced the extension of k = 0 solutions is also\npossible. We will discuss these cases in the next section.\nThe two ghost solutions with \u03b1 = 0 are:\n\n\u0398=\n\n\u2212\n\n(9)\n\nThe average scale factor a(t) = (\u03b7 2 + t2 )1/6 , behaves as\na \u221d t1/3 for |t| >> \u03b7, proper of a stiff fluid.\n\nWhen k = 0, the spatially flat case, the two dimensional line element (d\u03b82 + \u03b82 d\u03c62 ) can be cast into an\nexplicitly flat form: dx2 + dy 2 . In this case the analytical\ncontinuation of the scalar field simply does not exist. We,\ntherefore, will allow for a certain degree of inhomogeneity\nand consider the following form of the plane symmetric\n\n\f3\nsolutions,\n\nNow, for the solution (16) Ricci scalar is\n\nIt should be noted that the discussion here can be generalized in a straightforward manner to any G2 spacetime with two commuting spacelike Killing vectors by\nintroducing transversal gravitational degrees of freedom\nin the following form (eP (t,z) dx2 + e\u2212P (t,z) dy 2 ). The offdiagonal terms may also be included. For the sake of\nclarity, however, we stick to a simple plane symmetric\ncase, which we feel is sufficient to make our point.\nAssuming the geometry (10) the Klein-Gordon equation reads\n(11)\n\nand when \u03c6(t, z) is the solution of this equation, the metric function f (t, z) can be obtained by quadratures:\nf,t = 2\u01ebt(\u03c6,t 2 + \u03c6,z 2 )\nf,z = \u22124\u01eb\u03c6,t \u03c6,z .\n\n2\nz2\n\u2212 t)2b ,\nt\n\n(18)\n\nz 2 \u22122b2\n)\n.\nt\n\n(19)\n\nand, for the solution (17),\nR = 2b2 t\u22123/2 (t \u2212\n\nTherefore, the solutions (17) are singular at t = z, but\n(16) are not. Of course, there happen to be singularities\nat t = 0 in these expressions, but these are not of our\ninterest in this section. We have further checked the other\ncurvature scalars for (16), such as square and the cube\nof the Ricci and the Riemann tensors and found those\nregular at t = z. The possibility then arises, to continue\nthe solution (16) as it stands into the region |z| < t, by\nflipping the sign of the action. The spacetime could have\nlooked as depicted in fig. 2 below.\n\nt\n(12)\n(13)\nt=\n\u2212\nz\n\nAgain, if \u01eb is 1 we are dealing with the standard scalar\nfield, and when \u01eb = \u22121 it is a ghost. Thus, the NKE solutions are related to the positive kinetic energy solutions\nby f \u2192 \u2212f transformation.\nWe consider now two possible solutions to (11):\n\u0010z\u0011\n,\n|z| \u2265 t\n(14)\n\u03c61 = b arccosh\nt\n\nI\n\nI\n\nds[1], \u03c62\n\u03b5 = \u22121\n2\n\nz\n\n1\n\u03c6,tt + \u03c6,t \u2212 \u03c6,zz = 0,\nt\n\nR = \u22122b2 t\u22123/2 (\n\n(10)\n\nt=\n\n1\nds2 = \u221a ef (t,z) (\u2212dt2 + dz 2 ) + t(dx2 + dy 2 ).\nt\n\nII\n\nII\n2\n\nds [1], \u03c61\n\u03b5=1\n\nz\nSingularity\n\nand\n\u03c62 = b arccos\n\n\u0010z\u0011\nt\n\nFIG. 2: Mirror solutions\n\n,\n\n|z| \u2264 t.\n\n(15)\n\nNote that \u03c61 relates to \u03c62 by b \u2192 ib transformation even\nthough they \"operate\" in two different, mirror, regions\nof spacetime. The positive energy solutions of Einstein\nequations for \u03c61 and \u03c62 are:\n2\n1 z2\nds2 [1] = \u221a ( \u2212t)\u22122b (\u2212dt2 +dz 2 )+t(dx2 +dy 2 ), (16)\nt t\n\nfor |z| \u2265 t, and\n1\nz2 2\nds2 [2] = \u221a (t \u2212 )2b (\u2212dt2 + dz 2 ) + t(dx2 + dy 2 ), (17)\nt\nt\nfor |z| \u2264 t. It is amazing, however, that the positive\nand the negative energy solutions interchange when the\nkinetic energy sign flips over and the power 2b2 is even:\nthe negative energy solution for \u03c61 , is given by the line\nelement (17), while the negative energy solution for \u03c62\nis given by (16). Therefore, the same geometry (16) is\ninduced by either the normal scalar field in region |z| \u2265 t,\nor by a ghost field in its mirror region |z| \u2264 t. The same\napplies to (17).\n\nThe picture looks quite unexpected. One has equivalent geometry on both sides of the mirror line z = t,\nproduced by the standard scalar field in the region II,\nwhile the same geometry in the region I is produced by a\nghost. Technically this happens because the pure imaginary transformation of the scalar field \u03c61 into \u03c62 produces a real scalar field in a mirror region. It is tempting\nto call such scalar fields as mirror-ghosts. A different\npair of scalar fields which solve the equation\n\u221a (11) and\nhave the\nmirror\nghost\nproperties\nare\n\u03c6\n=\nb/\nt2 \u2212 z 2 and\n\u221a\n2\n2\n\u03c6 = b/ z \u2212 t .\nOn a closer inspection of the geometry, described by\nthe fig. 2, one finds that the co-ordinates t and z are not\nthat appropriate to describe the situation. It is convenient to introduce the following chart t = un + v n and\nz = un \u2212v n , where n = 1/(1\u22122b2) [12], and since we have\ninsisted that 2b2 is even, the power n must be negative.\nIt is then easy to see that the surface z = t corresponds\nto v n = 0 and it cannot be reached by a physical observer\nin a finite proper time. Thus the two regions are worlds\napart for their internal observers. The \"mirror\" and the\n\"real\" world do not mix up![18]\n\n\f4\nWe now consider inhomogeneous evolution with nontrivial spatial curvature. To do so, we generalize the\n\u03b1 = 0 solutions of the previous section using the following anzatz:\nds2 = \u2212dudv + R2 (u, v)(d\u03b82 + fk (\u03b8)2 d\u03c62 ).\n\n(20)\n\nwith fk (\u03b8) as defined in Eqn. (5).\nWith the energy-momentum tensor given by (1) we\nfind the following solution:\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u221a\n(1 \u2212 \u01ebp)kv \u2212 u\n1\n\u221a\n,\n(21)\n\u03c6(u, v) = \u221a ln\n2 \u01eb\n(1 + \u01ebp)kv \u2212 u\n1\nR2 (u, v) = [(1 \u2212 \u01ebp2 )k 2 v 2 \u2212 2kvu + u2 ], (22)\n4\nwhere the parameter p represents the strength of the\nscalar field. For k = 1 and \u01eb = 1 the solution reduces to\nthe one found by Roberts [15]. It was further thoroughly\ninvestigated by various authors in connection with the\nspherically symmetric scalar field collapse (see, for example, [16]). In the standard scalar field case, the k = 0\nsolutions are flat spacetimes written in plane wave coordinates. While, the k = \u22121 represents scalar field\ncollapse/expansion with open geometry where one does\nnot expect black hole formations since the trapped surfaces, if formed, are non-compact. Thus, in the k = \u22121\ncase one either has a naked singularity or a regular collapse/expansion similar to the case of k = 1 [16].\nWe now consider the phantom solutions (\u01eb = \u22121).\nThese are given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\npkv\n.\n(23)\n\u03c6(u, v) = arctan\nkv \u2212 u\nOne can see that the scalar field remains regular everywhere. As a consequence, the scalar curvature is also\nregular everywhere, but in the geometrical centre u = 0\nand v = 0:\nR=\u2212\n\n8k 2 p2 uv\n.\n+ (kv \u2212 u)2 ]2\n\n[p2 k 2 v 2\n\n(24)\n\nThe higher order curvature invariants behave in a similar way. It is further informative to look at the character of the gradient of the area coordinate R(u, v), i.e.,\nR\u03b1 (u, v)R\u03b1 (u, v) [17], which is given by\nR\u03b1 R\u03b1 = k \u2212 k 2\n\np2 k 2 v 2\n\np2 uv\n+ (kv \u2212 u)2\n\n(25)\n\nThe character of the gradient of the area coordinate tells\none about trappedness of the surfaces. It follows, that\nfor a given k, the character of the area gradient never\nchanges the sign (this doesn't happen in the non-ghost\ncase where the area gradient is parameter p- sensitive).\nNote, that the change k = 1 to k = \u22121 corresponds to a\n\nchange v \u2192 \u2212v, or, in t and r co-ordinates (t = u + v and\nr = u \u2212 v) to an r \u2194 t interchange, exactly as in the homogeneous cases (6), (7). Therefore, the solutions with\nk = 1 should be seen as dynamical generalizations of the\nGibbons-Rasheed worm hole [7], and in fact if looked at\ncarefully in (t, r) coordinates represent a time sequence\nof static worm holes. The solutions with k = \u22121 are\ninhomogeneous generalizations of the solution (7). This\ninterpretation is further stressed by the behaviour of the\narea gradient, being globally timelike (or null) in the cosmological case, and globally spacelike (or null) in the case\nof k = 1.\nOne can as well look at the scalar curvature singularity\nat u = 0 \u2229 v = 0 in t and r coordinates. The singularity\noccurs at R(t, r) = 0. In the k = 1 case this surface is\ngiven by the equation r2 + p2 (t \u2212 r)2 /4 = 0, while in the\nk = \u22121 case, it is t2 + p2 (t \u2212 r)2 /4 = 0. Therefore, the\nsingularity occurs at t = r = 0.\nOne may interpret the k = 1 solution along the lines\nof [16]. These, then represent non-singular ghost field\ncollapse. The ghost fields should be thought of as imploding from the past null infinity, (u \u2192 \u2212\u221e). One can\neasily check that the scalar field vanishes on v = 0 and is\nconstant along u = 0 null hypersurfaces. The mass function vanishes on both and so does the flux across these\nnull hypersurfaces. Therefore, one can match v < 0 and\nu > 0 regions with flat spacetime [16], avoiding singularities. We note that the parameter p plays no essential\nrole here.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have looked at various geometries produced by\nmassless scalar fields both with the positive and the negative kinetic energies. In the homogeneous case, we have\nshown the existence of non-singular anisotropic solution\nwith open spatial sections and NKE. Assuming inhomogeneous plane symmetry we have found mirror images\nwith exactly the same geometry in different regions of\nspacetime produced by the scalar fields with positive (in\none region) and the negative (in the other) kinetic energies. We have shown, however, that the physical observers from the positive energy region cannot reach the\nphantom geometry in a finite proper time. We have further generalized the self-similar scalar field dynamical solutions to include both the nontrivial curvature and the\nnegative NKE. These generalize the static ghost worm\nhole solution to the dynamical case (k = 1), and the\nhomogeneous anisotropic universe to the inhomogeneous\none (k = \u22121). The generalizations introduce singularities\nwhich can, probably, be removed by cutting and pasting\nmethods. In particular, if one interprets these solutions\nas a phantom scalar field collapse, the singularities can\nbe easily removed.\nThere seems to be much prejudice and suspicion\n\n\f5\nagainst fields with NKE, especially, due to their possible\nvacuum instability. The stability is important, however,\ndepending on which problem is to be addressed. If we\napproach the cosmological singularity, the decay of the\nfields with NKE should not pose conceptual difficulties.\nOne needs these fields just for short times to smoothen\nthe singularity, and when this is achieved they may as\nwell decay: the ghost appears and then disappears, leaving the world ghost-free. It would be interesting to see\nwhether the phenomenological approach considered here\ncan be obtained from field/string theories, we leave this,\nhowever, for future works.\n\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe are grateful to Jos\u00e9 Senovilla for helpful discussions\nand valuable comments.
