Thus, the ability to penetrate high extinction is crucial to\nexploring the earliest stages of high-mass star formation. Infrared, radio, and millimeter\nobservations have traditionally been used and provide important information on physical\nconditions in circumstellar disks and envelopes or in ionized winds or HII regions around\nthe massive young star. X-ray observations can also penetrate high extinction and provide\na different perspective that probes high-energy processes including magnetic activity originating close to the stellar surface, mass-loss as traced by shocked winds, jets, or outflows,\nand hot diffuse gas that pervades some young clusters containing massive young OB stars\nwith powerful winds.\nOne of the closest regions known to contain young high-mass stars is the infrared cluster\nnear the optical reflection nebula NGC 2071 in the Orion B region (Lynds 1630 dark cloud) at\na distance of \u223c400 pc (Anthony-Twarog 1982; Brown et al. 1994). Near-infrared observations\nby Lada et al. (1991) revealed more than 100 K-band sources in a 100 arc-min2 region down\nto K \u2248 14 mag. This extended cluster surrounds a dense central subgroup known as NGC\n2071-IR which contains at least 10 near-IR sources in a \u22481\u2032 \u00d7 1\u2032 region (Walther et al. 1993\n= Wa93). Of particular interest in the NGC 2071-IR subgroup are IRS-1, IRS-2, and IRS-3.\nThese sources are surrounded by compact HII regions (Snell & Bally 1986) and H2 O and OH\nmasers lie in proximity. More detailed information on NGC 2071-IR and properties of the\ninfrared sources can be found in Aspin, Sandell, & Walther (1992) and Wa93, and references\ntherein. The presence of strong ionizing UV radiation and maser emission strongly suggests\nthat these objects are young embedded early-type stars. Such objects are exceedingly rare\nat distances less than 500 pc and the NGC 2071 cluster thus plays a key role in observational\nstudies of high-mass star formation.\nWe report here on first results of a pointed X-ray observation of NGC 2071 obtained\nwith XMM-Newton. This observation is centered on the NGC 2071-IR subgroup and provides broader energy coverage and improved spectral information compared to two previous\nROSAT HRI exposures (rh202521/22) which captured the IR subgroup \u22488\u2032 - 10\u2032 off-axis.\nOur objectives were to (i) obtain an X-ray census of the NGC 2071 cluster and (ii) search\nfor X-ray emission from the massive embedded stars, whose X-ray properties are largely\nunknown. We report the detection of hard emission lying within 1\u2032\u2032 of NGC 2071-IRS1 and\ndiscuss its very unusual X-ray spectrum which is dominated by strong fluorescent Fe line\nemission.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n2.\n\nXMM-Newton Observations\n\nThe XMM-Newton observation began on 2005 March 30 at 15:20 UT and ended on\nMarch 31 at 03:53 UT. Pointing was centered on NGC 2071-IRS 1 (Wa93). The European\nPhoton Imaging Camera (EPIC) provided CCD imaging spectroscopy from the pn camera\n(Str\u00fcder et al. 2001) and two nearly identical MOS cameras (MOS1 and MOS2; Turner et\nal. 2001). The medium optical blocking filter was used. The EPIC cameras provide energy\ncoverage over E \u2248 0.2 - 15 keV with energy resolution E/\u2206E \u2248 20 - 50. The MOS cameras\nprovide the best on-axis angular resolution with FWHM \u2248 4.3\u2032\u2032 at 1.5 keV.\nData were reduced using the XMM-Newton Science Analysis System (SAS vers. 6.1).\nEvent files generated by XMM-Newton standard processing were time-filtered to remove the\nfirst \u224815 ksec of data, which were affected by high background radiation. This yielded 29.9\nksec of usable pn exposure and 30.1 ksec of usable exposure per MOS. Source detection\nwas accomplished with the SAS task edetect chain on images filtered in different bands.\nThese results were compared with the source list provided from the XMM-Newton pipeline\nprocessing and images were visually checked for missed or spurious detections. The properties\nof sources detected in the central cluster region (Table 1) are based on events in the 0.5 7.5 keV range.\nSpectra and light curves were extracted from circular regions of radius Re = 15\u2032\u2032 centered\non individual sources, corresponding to \u224868% encircled energy at 1.5 keV. Smaller regions\nwere used for a few closely spaced sources to avoid region overlap. Background files were\nextracted from circular source-free regions near the source. The SAS tasks rmfgen and arfgen\nwere used to generate source-specific response matrix files (RMFs) and auxiliary response\nfiles (ARFs) for spectral analysis. The data were analyzed using the XANADU software\npackage 1 , including XSPEC vers. 12.3.0.\n\n3.\n\nX-ray Overview of NGC 2071\n\nFigure 1 shows a broad-band 0.5 - 7 keV EPIC pn image of the central \u224810\u2032 \u00d7 10\u2032 cluster\nregion surrounding the NGC 2071-IR subgroup. Analysis of both the pn and MOS images\nresulted in 33 X-ray detections in this central region, as summarized in Table 1. Possible\ncounterparts were found for 23 of these 33 sources (70%) within a search radius of 2\u2032\u2032 using\n1\n\nThe XANADU X-ray analysis software package is developed and maintained by\nNASA's High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center (HEASARC). See\nhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xanadu/xanadu.html for further information.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nthe 2MASS, HST GSC v2.2, and USNO B1 electronic data bases. Of the 23 sources in Table\n1 with identifications, 22 have 2MASS counterparts and their Ks magnitudes are in the\nrange Ks = 6.3 - 14.1. The X-ray positions in Table 1 have been registered against 2MASS\nand the mean positional offset between the X-ray sources and their assigned counterparts\nis only 0.8\u2032\u2032 . A view of the harder X-ray sources in the cluster is seen in the 4 - 7 keV\nimage (Figure 2). The most prominent hard-band detections are a source lying within 1\u2032\u2032\nof IRS-1 (source 13 = XMM J054704.78+002143; Figs. 2 and 3), a source associated with\n2MASS J054705.25+002253 (source 16), a close X-ray pair lying near the position of IRAS\n05445+0016 (sources 20 and 21; Fig. 4), and variable X-rays (Fig. 5) from the emission-line\nstar LkH\u03b1 308 (source 19). These hard sources are discussed further below.\nSufficient counts were present in 21 sources to obtain fits of the X-ray spectra with\neither one-temperature (1T) or two-temperature (2T) apec optically thin plasma models.\nThe absorbed fluxes for these objects based on spectral fits are given in Table 1 and fluxes\nfor fainter sources were estimated using PIMMS2 . Two-temperature models gave acceptable\nfits of 10 of the brightest sources, excluding source 13 which is discussed in detail below (Sec.\n4). These 10 sources (source numbers 1,4,8,12,14,18,19,20,21,29) gave a median hydrogen\ncolumn density log NH = 22.0 cm\u22122 and median plasma temperatures kT1 = 0.74 keV and\nkT2 = 2.8 keV. The means are nearly identical to the medians.\n\n3.1.\n\nThe NGC 2071-IR Region\n\nFigure 3 shows the summed MOS1+2 image of the NGC 2071-IR region known to\ncontain embedded massive young stars. An unusual X-ray source (source 13) is nearly\ncoincident with IRS-1. Its offset from the VLA position of IRS-1 (Torrelles et al. 1998)\nand the near-IR source 2MASS J054704.78+002142 is only 0.\u2032\u2032 7. Thus, an association of\nthis X-ray source with IRS-1 is likely. A search of the HEASARC galaxies data base 3\nrevealed no known galaxies or AGNs within 20\u2032\u2032 of the IRS-1 position so the probability of\na chance association between this X-ray source and a distant background object is small. A\ncatalogued VLA 20 cm radio source NVSS J054705.01+002147.2 lies 5.\u2032\u2032 1 northeast of the\nX-ray peak and is most probably associated with IRS-5, which is offset by only 0.\u2032\u2032 7 from\nthe VLA source.\nThe X-ray source located within 1\u2032\u2032 of IRS-1 has 262 net pn counts (0.5 - 7.5 keV; Re\n2\n\nFurther information on the Portable Interactive Multi-Mission Simulator (PIMMS) can be found at\nhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/tools/pimms.html.\n3\n\nhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/W3Browse/w3browse.pl\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n= 15\u2032\u2032 ) and its mean photon energy <E> = 4.62 keV is the highest of any source in Table\n1. Not only is it visible in the 4 - 7 keV hard-band image (Fig. 2), it is also seen in images\nrestricted to the higher 8 - 12 keV range. No large amplitude flare-like variability is seen in\nthe X-ray light curve of this source (Fig. 6) but fluctuations at the \u22482\u03c3 level are present.\nA \u03c72 test using the pn light curve gives a probability of constant count rate rate Pconst =\n0.13 (\u03c72 /dof = 19.8/14; bin size = 2000 s), so no significant variability can be claimed.\nFainter X-ray emission is visible in Figure 3 extending to the northeast of IRS-1 that may\nbe associated with IRS-2 (\u03b4 = 11.\u2032\u2032 4), IRS-3 (\u03b4 = 5.\u2032\u2032 6), or IRS-5 (\u03b4 = 6.\u2032\u2032 2) where the offsets\n\u03b4 are relative to IRS-1. In addition, faint emission is present near the position of HH 437\n(Zhao et al. 1999) which lies \u224815\u2032\u2032 northeast of IRS-1. Higher angular resolution images will\nbe needed to make unambiguous identifications for this fainter emission.\n\n3.2.\n\nThe IRAS 05445+0016 Region\n\nThe luminous far-IR source IRAS 05445+0016 is located \u2248 4\u2032 south of IRS-1, but with\nrather large IRAS position uncertainties (Fig. 4). This region is of interest because of\nreported maser detections in the vicinity (e.g. source Onsala 59 in Harju et al. 1998). The\nIRAS source was listed as a candidate pre-main sequence object by Clark (1991). Additional\nfar-IR scans of NGC 2071 at 50 \u03bcm and 100 \u03bcm were obtained with the Kuiper Airborne\nObservatory by Butner et al. (1990).\nA close pair of 2MASS sources separated by \u224815\u2032\u2032 lies on either side of the IRAS position (Fig. 4) and both were detected by XMM-Newton (sources 20 and 21). Both sources\nare visible in the hard-band image (Fig. 2). The southern source (source 20 = XMM\nJ054707.66+001740) has the highest mean count rate of all sources in Table 1. Its X-ray\nemission is clearly variable as discerned by a slow decay in the pn light curve during the\nobservation. Its pn spectrum shows a hard component including emission from the Fe K\ncomplex (\u22486.7 keV). We were able to obtain a good spectral fit with an absorbed twotemperature optically thin apec plasma model with an absorption column density log NH\n= 21.8 cm\u22122 , plasma temperature components at kT1 = 0.87 keV and kT2 = 3.1 keV, and\n\u03c72 /dof = 94.8/97. The combination of X-ray variability and a high-temperature component\n(T2 \u2248 36 MK) are characteristic of magnetic activity. The northerly source (source 21 =\nXMM J054707.93+001755) is offset by only 0.\u2032\u2032 8 from the B-type star HDE 290861 (V1380\nOri), a known eclipsing binary system with a component separation of 0.\u2032\u2032 59 at position angle\n(PA) \u2248217\u25e6 (Prieur et al. 2001). Higher spatial resolution observations will be needed to\ndetermine whether the X-rays come from the B star itself or the companion.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n3.3.\n\nLkH\u03b1 308\n\nThe second brightest X-ray detection in Table 1 is LkH\u03b1 308 (source 19 = XMM\nJ054707.29+001932). This V = 15.6 mag emission-line star was identified as a probable\nT Tauri star by Herbig & Kuhi (1963) and H\u03b1 emission was confirmed by Wiramihardja et\nal. (1989). It was discovered to be a relatively bright infrared source by Strom, Strom, &\nVrba (1976) and 2MASS data give Ks = 8.3 mag. LkH\u03b1 308 is an X-ray variable as discerned\nfrom its pn light curve which shows a slow rise and fall in count rate by a factor of \u223c2 during\nthe observation (Fig. 5). The pn spectrum reveals a faint Fe K emission line and spectral\nfits with an absorbed two-temperature optically thin plasma model require a hot component\nat kT2 \u2248 3.5 - 5 keV as commonly seen in magnetically active T Tauri stars.\n\n4.\n\nX-ray Spectrum of IRS-1\n\nThe X-ray spectrum of the source that we associate with NGC 2071-IRS1 is unusual\ncompared to the optically thin plasma spectra typically seen in young stellar objects. As\nFigure 7 shows, the spectrum is characterized by a nearly flat broad-band continuum that\nis heavily absorbed below \u22481 keV and a strong broad emission line from neutral or nearneutral iron near 6.4 keV. The fluorescent Fe line dominates the spectrum and its intensity\nand width are exceptional for a young stellar object.\nThe spectrum in Figure 7 was extracted using a circular region of radius Re = 15\u2032\u2032\nand may include contributions from the nearby sources IRS-2, IRS-3, and IRS-5, which lie\nat offsets of 5.\u2032\u2032 6 - 11.\u2032\u2032 4 from IRS-1. However, we were able to recover a nearly identical\nspectrum including the strong fluorescent Fe line when using a smaller extraction region of\nradius Re = 4\u2032\u2032 . The positions of IRS-2, IRS-3, and IRS-5 lie outside this smaller circle and\neven though there could be some PSF overlap these results suggest that IRS-1 (or an as yet\nunresolved source within a few arcseconds of IRS-1) is the dominant X-ray contributor.\nWe attempted to fit the spectrum using a conventional optically thin plasma model with\na single absorption component plus a Gaussian line near 6.4 keV. This model ran away to\nunphysically high temperatures even when multiple temperature components were allowed.\nHowever, we were able to fit the spectrum with either (i) an absorbed power-law continuum\nwith a photon power-law index \u03b1ph = +0.55 plus a Gaussian line centered at Eline = 6.48\nkeV (\u03c72 /dof = 14.3/14) or (ii) a two-component optically thin plasma model with a cool\nmoderately absorbed component and a hot heavily-absorbed component plus a Gaussian line\ncentered at Eline = 6.43 keV (\u03c72 /dof = 10.7/11). Fit results are summarized in Table 2.\nBoth the power-law and thermal fits are formally acceptable but the thermal model\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nprovides a better fit of the shape of the spectrum at lower energies between 1 - 2 keV and\nis easier to justify on physical grounds. Also, the X-ray absorption log NH = 22.0 cm\u22122\ndetermined from the power-law model corresponds to a visual extinction AV = 4.5 mag\n(Gorenstein 1975), which is much less than the range AV \u2248 28 - 51 mag expected toward\nIRS-1 if it is an embedded B0 - B5 star (Wa93). The thermal model yields higher absorptions\nthat are consistent with the range expected for IRS-1. However, we do consider the possibility\nof power-law models further in Section 5.\nHigh (but physically realisitic) X-ray temperatures are required by the two-component\nthermal model to reproduce the broad-band continuum (Table 2). The absorption inferred\nfor the hot component at kT2 = 10.8 keV is log NH,2 = 23.2 cm\u22122 . This NH,2 implies an\nequivalent visual extinction AV \u2248 70 mag (Gorenstein 1975). Thus, the high-temperature\nsource is heavily obscured. The absorption associated with the cooler component at kT1 =\n0.7 keV is log NH,1 = 22.6 cm\u22122 , or AV \u2248 17 mag. The strong Fe line accounts for \u224830% of\nthe observed (absorbed) flux in the 0.5 - 7.5 keV range. The Gaussian line width deduced\nfrom the thermal model \u03c3line = 140 eV gives FWHM = 330 eV. The line is quite likely\nresolved since the pn intrinsic energy resolution is FWHM \u2248 160 eV at 6.5 keV.\n\n4.1.\n\nThe Fluorescent Fe Line\n\nThe physical picture needed to explain the fluorescent Fe emission requires the presence\nof neutral or near-neutral material in proximity to the X-ray source. This material is irradiated by the hard source, which is quite likely the embedded high-mass star. The origin of the\nline broadening is clearly of interest. Velocity broadening of a single line cannot fully account\nfor the line width without invoking unrealistically high velocities. Some of the broadening\ncould be due to multiple closely-spaced Fe lines that are not spectrally distinguishable at the\npn energy resolution. In this regard, inspection of the unfolded spectral model shows that a\nfainter Fe K line may contribute to some of the flux near 6.7 keV but this line, if present, is\nmasked by the broad wings of the 6.43 keV fluorescent line.\nIf the broad fluorescent line width is a column density effect then the inferred column\ndensity is large. The line equivalent width (EW) is related to the column density of cold\nfluorescent material in the optically thin slab approximation by EW \u2248 2.3 N24 keV (Kallman\n1995), where N24 is the column density of the cold matter in units of 1024 cm\u22122 . In the\npresent case, our pn spectrum measurements give EW = 2.4 keV so NH,cold \u223c 1024.0 cm\u22122 .\nThe lower signal-to-noise ratio MOS spectra give a somewhat smaller value EW = 1.4 keV\nor NH,cold \u223c 1023.8 cm\u22122 . The value determined from the pn spectrum is at the upper limit\nwhere Kallman's approximation breaks down but if the 6.43 keV feature is a blend then the\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\ninferred value of NH,cold is only an upper limit.\nThe above approximation indicates that the absorption column of the cold material is\nabout an order of magnitude greater than the absorption inferred for the hard thermal X-ray\ncomponent (Table 2). The material responsible for absorption of the hard X-rays cannot\nfully account for NH,cold (see also eq. [4] of Tsujimoto et al. 2005). Thus, the cold fluoresced\nmaterial may not lie directly on the line-of-sight. One possibility is that the fluorescent line\noriginates in the dense ridge of molecular gas orthogonal to the outflow axis which may be\na rotating disk (Bally 1982; Seth, Greenhill, & Holder 2002).\nFluorescent Fe line analysis similar to that above has been undertaken on YSOs in\nother high-mass star-forming regions. Of particular relevance is the Chandra study of the\nSgr B2 giant molecular cloud by Takagi, Murakami, & Koyama (2002), who reported hightemperature plasma and strong 6.4 keV line emission for some luminous X-ray sources.\nSpecifically, they obtained kT \u2248 10 keV and a fluorescent Fe line equivalent width EW =\n630 (180 - 1100; 90% confidence) eV for Sgr B2 source 10 (CXO J174720.2\u2212282305). Takagi\net al. note that this X-ray source lies near an ultracompact HII region and may correspond\nto a massive YSO. The X-ray temperature reported for Sgr B2 source 10 is similar to what\nwe infer for the hot component of NGC 2071 IRS1, but the fluorescent line equivalent width\nand derived value of NH,cold is \u22483 - 4 times larger for IRS1.\n\n5.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe unusual X-ray spectrum of the source near the massive young star IRS-1 warrants\nfurther discussion. The presence of cool and hot plasma components apparently seen through\ndifferent absorption columns suggests that more than one source or X-ray emission process\ncontributes to the spectrum. We consider possible emission processes below.\n\n5.1.\n\nSimilarities with Jet-Driving T Tauri Stars\n\nThe need to invoke two thermal X-ray components at different absorption columns to fit\nX-ray spectra has also recently been seen in some accreting low-mass pre-main sequence stars\nsuch as the T Tauri star DG Tau A (G\u00fcdel et al. 2005). High-resolution Chandra images\nreveal a two-component X-ray source consisting of a relatively hard strongly-absorbed point\nsource at the stellar position and softer less-absorbed X-ray emission extending along a\nbipolar jet several arcseconds from the star. The jet is also seen in the optical. Spectral\nextractions centered on the star capture emission from both components, resulting in a\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\ndouble-absorption spectrum. Some of the softer emission is due to the shocked jet while the\nharder point-like emission at the position of DG Tau A is undoubtedly of magnetic origin.\nIt is conceivable that a similar phenomenon could be responsible for the double-absorption\nX-ray spectrum detected here for IRS-1. It is unavoidable that our spectral extraction captures a rather large region around the X-ray source and could sample shocked wind or outflow\nemission that is offset by several arc-seconds from the central source. At d = 400 pc, the\nXMM-Newton PSF (FWHM \u2248 4.\u2032\u2032 3) corresponds to FWHM \u2248 1700 AU and our nominal\nsource extraction radius Re = 15\u2032\u2032 corresponds to a radius of 6000 AU (0.03 pc). The velocity of the bipolar molecular outflow (\u224870 km s\u22121 ; Bally 1982) is too low to produce\nshock-heated plasma at the temperatures inferred from the X-ray spectral fits. However, a\nhigher velocity stellar wind or jet could suffice. The presence of a compact HII region and\nluminosity considerations suggest that IRS-1 may be an embedded \u223cB0 - B5 star (Wa93)\nwhich could indeed have already developed a strong wind. Also, IRS-3 lies within our Re =\n15\u2032\u2032 extraction region and it is known to have a radio jet (Torreles et al. 1998).\nSimple shock-heating models (Krolik & Raymond 1985; Raga et al. 2002) give a predicted shock temperature Ts \u2248 1.5 \u00d7 105 (vs /100 km s\u22121 )2 K, where vs is the shock speed\nrelative to the upstream flow. In order to reach X-ray temperatures comparable to that of\nthe cool X-ray component T1 = 8.7 [2.3 - 11.6] MK (Table 2), shock speeds vs \u2248 760 [390\n- 880] km s\u22121 would be required. These are fast shocks but perhaps within reason if IRS-1\nis an embedded early B-type star. The above shock speed is only about half the terminal\nwind speed of a B3 V star and about one-third that of a B0 V star (Table 4 of Cassinelli et\nal. 1994).\n\n5.2.\n\nComments on X-rays from Wind Shocks\n\nX-rays from radiation-driven wind shocks in early-type stars are predicted on theoretical\ngrounds (Lucy 1982; Lucy & White 1980). The expected X-ray temperatures are <1 keV\nso this process could at best account only for the cooler plasma seen in the two-component\nspectrum. However, the moderately high X-ray absorption, plasma temperature, and required shock speed for the cool X-ray component noted above stretch the limits of what the\nradiative wind shock model can accommodate.\nA more interesting possibility is that the hot plasma is shock related. The impact of a\nhigh-velocity wind or jet-like outflow from IRS-1 on a close companion or other obstruction\ncould produce high-temperature X-ray plasma in a colliding wind shock. The colliding\nwind picture is usually invoked to explain high-temperature X-ray emission in massive close\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nbinaries such as WR + O systems (e.g. Skinner et al. 2001), but in the present case the highspeed wind of the embedded star might actually be shocking on dense surrounding material.\nInterestingly, Seth et al. (2002) have suggested that the walls of the cavity surrounding IRS-1\nmight be the interface between outflowing and infalling material. A similar picture in which\na high-velocity stellar wind is shocking on dense surrounding clumps has been discussed by\nKitamura et al. (1990).\nThe maximum colliding wind shock temperature in the adiabatic case is kTcw \u2248 1.95\n(v\u22a5,s /1000 km s\u22121 )2 keV, where v\u22a5,s is the velocity component normal to the shock interface\n(Luo, McCray, & MacLow 1990). Thus, a B0 V star with a terminal wind speed v\u221e \u2248 2500\nkm s\u22121 could in principle produce very hot X-ray plasma at kTcw \u2248 12 keV, similar to the\nvalue kT2 \u2248 11 keV inferred for the hot component in the X-ray spectrum (Table 2). The\ncolliding wind model, if relevant, would of course need to account for the X-ray luminosity\n(Table 2). The X-ray luminosity predicted for a colliding wind system is a sensitive function\nof mass-loss parameters and orbital separation (Luo et al. 1990). In the absence of such\ninformation for IRS1, a meaningful comparison with theory cannot be made and the colliding\nwind scenario thus remains quite speculative.\n\n5.3.\n\nMagnetic Processes in Massive Young Stars?\n\nThe hard X-ray continuum detected in IRS-1 extends up to at least 8 keV. Such hard\nemission represents an extreme case for wind-generated shocks but is not uncommon for Xray emission from magnetic reconnection processes that are observed in low-mass pre-main\nsequence stars (T Tauri stars) and even some low-mass protostars (Imanishi, Koyama, &\nTsuboi 2001).\nSome additional support for magnetic behavior in massive young stellar objects comes\nfrom the Chandra detection of the high-mass embedded object Mon R2 IRS-2 (Kohno et\nal. 2002). The X-ray absorption, temperature, and X-ray luminosity reported for Mon R2\nIRS-2 are strikingly similar to the values we determine for the hot component of NGC 2071\nIRS-1. However, the fluorescent Fe line was not seen in Mon R2 IRS-2. More importantly,\nthe X-ray emission of Mon R2 IRS-2 was found to be variable on timescales of a few 104 s, as\nwas that of at least two other embedded high-mass YSOs in Mon R2. The presence of such\nshort-term variability in combination with very hot plasma is a strong argument in favor of\nmagnetic processes.\nBecause of the close similarities in X-ray spectral properties between NGC 2071 IRS-1\nand Mon R2 IRS-2 (apart from the lack of fluorescent Fe in the latter), it is quite possible\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nthat their high-temperature X-ray emission arises from similar processes. If the emission is\nindeed of magnetic origin, then the key questions are whether the emission is due to as yet\nundetected late-type companions or the massive YSOs themselves. If the emission is intrinsic\nto the embedded high-mass objects, then the theoretical challenge will be to determine if\nthe fields are internally generated (and by what mechanism), or instead primordial.\n\n5.4.\n\nX-rays from Inverse Compton Scattering\n\nIn conclusion, we comment briefly on the possibility that the X-ray continuum emission\nof the hard source near IRS-1 is nonthermal. As we have noted, the spectrum can be fitted\nwith an absorbed power-law continuum plus a Gaussian Fe line (model B in Table 2), but the\ninferred absorption is much less than expected toward IRS-1. The production of nonthermal\nX-rays from OB star winds has been considered by Chen & White (1991). In their model,\nhard X-rays above 2 keV can be produced by inverse Compton scattering of stellar UV\nphotons by relativistic electrons accelerated in wind shocks near the star.\nTo explore the nonthermal possibility further, we fitted the pn X-ray spectrum with\na model consisting of an absorbed cool thermal component and an absorbed power-law\ncomponent plus a Gaussian line. The cool thermal component is intended to model any soft\nradiative wind shock emission and the power-law component models nonthermal emission\nfrom inverse Compton scattering. Different absorption columns were allowed for the thermal\nand power-law components. This model gives a statistically acceptable fit of the spectrum\n(\u03c72 /dof = 11.3/11) with a cool thermal plasma temperature kT1 \u2248 0.2 keV and a photon\npower-law index \u03b1ph = +0.6. However, the fit converges to a very large emission measure\nfor the cool thermal component which leads to a high unabsorbed luminosity LX \u223c 1034 ergs\ns\u22121 . The inferred presence of a very soft thermal component with extremely high emission\nmeasure viewed under high absorption log NH,1 \u2248 22.9 cm\u22122 is likely a result of fitting the\ndata with an inappropriate model and the fit results seem unphysical. We thus do not favor\nsuch a hybrid thermal + nonthermal emission model based on the existing data but the\nmodel would be worth reconsidering if higher quality spectra are obtained.\n\n6.\n\nSummary and Outlook\n\nWe have presented results of the first X-ray observation centered on the core region of\nthe infrared cluster in NGC 2071. The most important (and unanticipated) result of this\nstudy is the unusual X-ray spectrum of the source detected within 1\u2032\u2032 of the massive young\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nstellar object IRS-1. The small positional offset and strong X-ray absorption inferred from\nthermal spectral models make an association of this X-ray source with IRS-1 likely.\nThe high X-ray temperature implied by thermal models is characteristic of magnetic\nprocesses and raises the intriguing possibility that magnetic fields play an important role\nin X-ray production in young high-mass stars. Kohno et al. (2002) were led to a similar\nconclusion based on Chandra observations of massive young stars in Mon R2. However,\nthe role played by any as yet unresolved close companions in the X-ray emission process is\nunknown.\nA higher resolution Chandra observation of NGC 2071-IR now pending will answer several key questions regarding the origin of the unusual X-ray emission. Specifically, Chandra's\narc-second resolution will place tighter constraints on the position of the X-ray peak relative\nto IRS-1 and will determine if nearby objects such as IRS-2, IRS-3, or IRS-5 contribute to\nthe X-ray emission. The longer Chandra exposure will also provide a more definitive test for\nvariability on short timescales, a key discriminant between magnetic and shock processes.\n\nREFERENCES\nAnders, E. & Grevesse, N. 1989, Geochim.

All quantities are computed using events in the 0.5 - 7.5 keV range. Usable exposure times are 29,886 s for\npn and 30,114 s per MOS. Data are from EPIC pn unless otherwise noted. The count rate is based on events extracted within a\ncircular region of radius 15\u2032\u2032 (68% EEF) centered on the source and is background subtracted. A smaller source region of radius\n\u224810\u2032\u2032 was used for sources 5,16, and 21 due to source crowding. The absorbed flux (0.5 - 7.5 keV) is based on spectral fits using an\nabsorbed solar-abundance 1T or 2T optically thin plasma model (apec) in XSPEC, except as noted for faint sources. <E> is the mean\nphoton energy. Candidate identifications lie within 2\u2032\u2032 of the X-ray position and are based (in order of preference) on searches of the\n2MASS (2MA), HST GSC v2.2, and USNO B1 electronic data bases. The 2MASS Ks magnitude is given for sources with 2MASS\nidentifications. The quoted offset is the positional offset between the X-ray and 2MASS or USNO positions.\nb Based\n\non MOS2 events.

Thermal emission was modeled with a solar abundance (Anders & Grevesse 1989) apec optically thin\nplasma model in XSPEC. The tabulated parameters are absorption column\ndensity (NH ), plasma energy (kT), component normalization (norm), photon power-law index (\u03b1ph ), Gaussian line centroid energy (Eline ), and line\nwidth (\u03c3line = FWHM/2.35). Solar abundances are referenced to Anders\n& Grevesse (1989). Square brackets enclose 90% confidence intervals and\nan ellipsis means that the algorithm used to compute confidence intervals\ndid not converge. The total X-ray flux (FX ) and flux of the low-absorption\ncomponent (FX,1 ) are the absorbed values in the 0.5 - 7.5 keV range, followed in parentheses by unabsorbed values.
