For the quantitative estimation\nof this fraction one can use for a given interaction a characteristic, originating from cosmic\nray physics, inelasticity, which can be defined as\nM\nk1 (s) = \u221a ,\ns\n\n(1)\n\nwhere s \u2013 is square of c.m. energy and M is the mass of intermediate system which decays\ninto final produced particles. The remaining part of incident energy is carried away by\nparticipant's remnants \u2013 so-called leading particles. From experimental point of view more\nsuitable is another definition of inelasticity\n1 X\nk2 (s) = \u221a\ns i\nwhere \u03bci =\n\nq\n\nZ\n\ndy\u03bci\n\ndni\ncosh y,\ndy\n\n(2)\n\np2Ti + m2i is transverse mass of a produced particle of type i and dni /dy is its\n\nmeasured rapidity distribution. Fluctuation of inelasticity from event to event leads to the\ndistribution P (k) with mean inelasticity < k(s) >. The energy dependence of inelasticity is a\nproblem of great interest both from theoretical and experimental points of view. There is no\nconsensus in the physical community on the energy dependence of < k(s) >. The decrease\nof inelasticity with energy is advocated by some authors [1, 2, 3, 4] while others believe that\n\n\f2\ninelasticity is an increasing function of energy [5, 6, 7, 8]. The question can not be answered\nby collider experiments. At ISR energies (23 \u00f7 60 GeV) where leading particle spectrum\ncould be measured the inelasticity defined to be about 0.5. In the collider experiments at\nhigher energies (SPS and Tevatron) leading particles are emitted in an extremely forward\ncone and could not be measured due to the presence of the beam pipe. Obviously, multiplicity\ndistributions are connected with inelasticity distributions, and so one can study features of\nmultiplicity distributions deriving the information on inelasticity or fraction of the initial\nenergy converted into the particle production. As we know scaled multiplicity distributions\nexhibit KNO [9] scaling up to ISR energies which is violated for higher energy data (SPS)\nwhere they can be described approximately by the negative binomial distribution (NBD).\nAnd again at the most high SPS energy, 900 GeV, there is an evident deviation of multiplicity\ndistributions from NBD. In this paper we demonstrate that there is a connection between\nthe energetic behaviour of the shapes of scaled multiplicity distributions and inelasticity\ndistributions which, in turn, relates to the effect of the total cross section growth. For this\npurpose we use geometrical considerations which are justified by the following arguments.\nFirst, hadrons are extended objects with the size about 1 fm and ,second, at high energies\nde\u2013Bloglie wave\u2013length becomes small.\nOur analysis is based on the model of hadron structure so-called Strongly Correlated\nQuark Model (SCQM) [10] which is described in Section 2. In Section 3 the model is\napplied for the calculation of proton \u2013 proton total cross sections and simulation of inelastic\nevents.\n\nII.\n\nSTRONGLY CORRELATED QUARK MODEL\n\nThe ingredients of the model are the following. A single quark a of definite colour\nembedded in vacuum starts to polarize its surrounding that results in the formation of quark\nand gluon condensate. At the same time it experiences the pressure of vacuum because of\nzero point radiation field or vacuum fluctuations which act the quark tending to destroy\nthe ordering of the condensate. Suppose that we place the corresponding antiquark in the\nvicinity of the first one. Owing to their opposite signs colour polarization fields of quark\nand antiquark interfere destructively in the overlapped space regions eliminating each other\nat most in the middle\u2013point between the quarks. This effect leads to the decreasing of\n\n\f3\ncondensates density in the same space region and overbalancing of the vacuum pressure\nacting on quark and antiquark from outer space regions. As a result the attractive force\nbetween quark and antiquark emerges and quark and antiquark start to move towards each\nother. The density of the remaining condensate around quark (antiquark) is identified with\nthe hadronic matter distribution. At maximum displacement in qq\u2212 system that corresponds\nto small overlapping of polarization fields the hadronic matter distributions have maximum\nextent and magnitude. The closer they to each other, the larger is the effect of mutual\ndestruction and the smaller hadronic matter distributions are around quarks and the larger\ntheir kinetic energies. In that way quark and antiquark start to oscillate around their\nmiddle\u2013point. For such interacting qq\u2212 pair located on X axis at the distance of 2x from\neach other the total Hamiltonian is\n\nH=\n\nmq\nmq\n+\n+ Vqq (2x),\n2\n1/2\n(1 \u2212 \u03b2 )\n(1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 )1/2\n\n(3)\n\nwere mq , mq \u2013 current masses of valence antiquark and quark, \u03b2 = \u03b2(x) \u2013 their velocity\ndepending on displacement x and Vqq \u2013 quark\u2013antiquark potential energy at separation 2x.\nIt can be rewritten as\n\u0014\n\u0015 \u0014\n\u0015\nmq\nmq\nH=\n+ U(x) +\n+ U(x) = Hq + Hq ,\n(1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 )1/2\n(1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 )1/2\n\n(4)\n\nwere U(x) = 12 Vqq (2x) is potential energy of quark or antiquark. Quark (antiquark) with the\nsurrounding cloud (condensate) of quark - antiquark pairs and gluons, or hadronic matter\ndistribution, forms the constituent quark. It is natural to assume that the potential energy\nof quark (antiquark), U(x), corresponds to the mass MQ of the constituent quark:\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n\u2032\n\u2032\ndx\u2032 \u03c1(x, r\u2032 ) \u2248 2MQ (x)\ndy\ndz\n2U(x) = C1\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(5)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere C1 is a dimensional constant and hadronic matter density distribution, \u03c1(x, r\u2032 ), is\ndefined as\n\u03c1(x, r\u2032 ) = C2 |\u03c6(x, r\u2032 )| = C2 \u03c6Q (x\u2032 + x, y \u2032, z \u2032 ) \u2212 \u03c6Q (x\u2032 \u2212 x, y \u2032, z \u2032 ) .\n\n(6)\n\nHere C2 is a constant, \u03c6Q and \u03c6Q are density profiles of the condensates around quark and\nantiquark located at distance 2x from each other. Here, we consider that the condensates\naround quark and antiquark have opposite colour charges. They look like compressive stress\nand tensile stress (around defects) in solids. The generalization to a three-quark system\n\n\f4\nin baryons is performed according to SU(3)color symmetry: in general, pair of quarks have\ncoupled representations\n3\u22973 =6\u22953\n\n(7)\n\nin SU(3)color and for quarks within the same baryon only the 3 (antisymmetric) representation occurs. Hence, the antiquark can be replaced by two correspondingly coloured quarks\nto get a colour singlet baryon and the destructive interference takes place between colour\nfields of three valence quarks (VQs). Putting aside the mass and charge differences and\nspins of valence quarks we may say that inside the baryon three quarks oscillate along the\nbisectors of the equilateral triangle. Therefore, keeping in mind that quark and antiquark\nin mesons and three quarks in baryons are strongly correlated, we can consider each of\nthem separately as undergoing oscillatory motion under the potential (5) in 1+1 dimension.\nHereinafter, we consider VQ oscillating along X\u2212 axis, and Z\u2212 axis is a perpendicular to\nthe plane of oscillation XY . Density profiles of condensates around VQs are taken in the\ngaussian form. It has been shown in papers [11] that the wave packet solutions of time\ndependent Schrodinger equation for a harmonic oscillator move in exactly the same way\nas corresponding classical oscillators. These solutions are called \"coherent states\". This\nrelationship justifies our semiclassical treatment of quark dynamics.\nWe specify the mass of constituent quark at maximum displacement as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 m\u2206 + mN\n\u2248 360 MeV,\nMQ(Q) (xmax ) =\n3\n2\nwhere m\u2206 and mN are masses delta\u2013isobar and nucleon respectively. The parameters of\nthe model, namely, maximum displacement, xmax , and parameters of the gaussian function,\n\u03c3x,y,z , for hadronic matter distribution around VQ are chosen inside the following corridors:\nxmax = 0.64 \u00f7 0.66 fm, \u03c3x,y = 0.24 \u00f7 0.28 fm, \u03c3z = 0.12 \u00f7 0.20 fm.\n\n(8)\n\nThey are estimated by comparison of calculated and experimental values of inelastic cross\nsections, \u03c3in (s), and the inelastic overlap function Gin (s, b) for pp\u2212 and pp\u2212 collisions (see the\nnext section). The current mass of the valence quark is taken to be 5 MeV. The behaviour\nof potential (5) evidently demonstrates the relationship between constituent and current\nquark states inside a hadron (Fig. 1). At maximum displacement quark is nonrelativistic,\nconstituent one (VQ surrounded by the condensate), since the influence of polarization\nfields of other quarks becomes minimal and the VQ possesses the maximal potential energy\n\n\f5\ncorresponding to the mass of the constituent quark. At the origin of oscillation, x = 0,\nantiquark and quark in mesons and three quarks in baryons, being close to each other,\nhave maximum kinetic energy and correspondingly minimum potential energy and mass:\nthey are relativistic, current quarks (bare VQs). This configuration corresponds to so-called\n\"asymptotic freedom\" . In the intermediate region there is increasing (decreasing) of the\nconstituent quark mass by dressing (undressing) of VQs due to decreasing (increasing) of\nthe destructive interference effect. The evolution of colour charge density profiles of quark\n\u2013 antiquark pair during the half-period of oscillation is shown in Fig. 2. Here, we suppose\nthat the quark colour charge is positive and the antiquark color charge is negative.\nThe proposed dynamical picture meets local gauge invariance principle. Indeed, destructive interference of color fields of quark and antiquark in mesons and three quarks in baryons\ndepending on their displacements can be treated as a phase rotation of wave function of a\nsingle VQ in colour space \u03c8c on angle \u03b8 depending on the displacement x of the VQ in the\ncoordinate space\n\u03c8c (x) \u2192 eig\u03b8(x) \u03c8c (x).\n\n(9)\n\nThe color phase rotation,in turn, leads to VQ dressing (undressing) by quark and gluon\ncondensate that corresponds to the transformation of a gauge field\nA\u03bc (x) \u2192 A\u03bc (x) + \u2202\u03bc \u03b8(x).\n\n(10)\n\nHere, we drop colour indices of A\u03bc (x) and consider each quark of specific colour separately\nas changing its effective colour charge, g\u03b8(x), in color fields of other quarks (antiquark)\ndue to the destructive interference. Thus, gauge transformations (9), (10) map internal\n(isotopic) space of a colored quark onto the coordinate space. On the other hand, this\ndynamical picture of VQ dressing (undressing) corresponds to the chiral symmetry breaking\n(restoration). Due to this mechanism of VQs oscillations the nucleon runs over the states\ncorresponding to the certain terms of the infinite series of Fock space\n| Bi = c1 | q1 q2 q3 i + c2 | q1 q2 q3 qqi + c3 | q1 q2 q3 gi...\n\n(11)\n\nThe proposed model has some important consequences. Inside hadrons the valence quarks\nand accompanying them gluons and quark-antiquark pairs, as well, are strongly correlated.\nNucleons are nonspherical object: they are flattened along the axis perpendicular to the\nplane of quarks oscillations.\n\n\f6\nFrom the form of the quark potential (Fig. 1) one can conclude that dynamics of VQ\ncorresponds to nonlinear oscillator and VQ with its surrounding can be treated as a nonlinear\nwave packet. Moreover, our quark \u2013 antiquark system turned out to be identical to so-called\n\"breather\" solution of (nonlinear) sine\u2013Gordon (SG) equation[12]. SG equation in (1+1)\ndimension in the reduced form for scalar function \u03c6(x, t) is given by\n\u0003\u03c6(x, t) + sin \u03c6(x, t) = 0,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere x, t-dimensionless. Breather is a periodic solution representing a bound state of a\nsoliton-antisoliton pair which oscillates around its center of mass:\ni\uf8f9\nh p\n\uf8ee\nsinh ut/ (1 \u2212 u2\ni\uf8fb ,\nh p\n\u03c6br (x, t) = 4 tan\u22121 \uf8f0\n2\nu cosh x/ (1 \u2212 u\n\n(13)\n\nwhere u is 4-velocity. During the oscillations of the soliton-antisoliton pair their density\n\nprofile\n\u03c6br (x, t) =\n\nd\u03c6br (x, t)\ndx\n\n(14)\n\nevolves like our quark\u2013antiquark system, i.e. at the maximal displacement the soliton and\nantisoliton are emphasized maximal and at the minimum displacement they \"annihilate\"\n(Fig. 3). This similarity is not surprising because our quark\u2013antiquark system was formulated in close analogy with the model of dislocation-antidislocation which in the continuous\nlimit is described by the breather solution of SG equation [13]. It can be shown that soliton, antisoliton and breather obey relativistic kinematics, i.e. their energies, momenta and\nshapes are transformed according to Lorentz transformations. Since the above consideration of quarks as solitons is purely classical the important problem is to construct quantum\nstates around them. Although the soliton solution of SG equation looks like an extended\n(quantum) particle the relation of classical solitons to quantum particles is not so trivial.\nThe technique of quantization of the classical solitons with the usage of various methods\nhas been developed by many authors. The most known of them is semiclassical method of\nquantization (WKB) which allows one to relate classical periodic orbits (breather solution\nof SG) with the quantum energy levels [14].\nHereinafter, we adhere to our semiclassical model (SCQM) applying it for analysis of\ncross sections and the multiparticle production in hadron\u2013hadron collisions.\n\n\f7\nIII.\n\nHADRON - HADRON COLLISIONS\n\nDifferent configurations of the quark content inside a hadron realized at the instant of\nthe collision result in different types of reactions. The probability of finding any quark\nconfiguration inside the hadron is defined by the probability of VQ's displacement in a\nproper frame of the hadron:\nP (x)dx = q\n\nAdx\n1 \u2212 m2q / [Eq \u2212 U(x)]2\n\n,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere Eq is a total energy of the valence quark (antiquark) and a constant A can be derived\nfrom the normalization condition\nZ\u221e\n\nP (x)dx = 1.\n\n(16)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nConfigurations with nonrelativistic constituent quarks ( x \u2243 xmax ) in both colliding hadrons\nlead to soft interactions with the nondiffractive multiparticle production in central and\nfragmentation regions (Fig. 4a). The hard scattering with the jet production and the\nlarge angle elastic scattering take place when configurations with current VQs (x \u2243 0) in\nboth colliding hadrons are realized (Fig. 4b). The near current quark configuration inside\none of the hadrons and constituent quark configuration inside the second one result in\nsingle diffraction scattering (Fig. 4c). And at last intermediate configurations inside one or\nboth hadrons are responsible for semihard and double diffractive scattering (Fig. 4d). The\nsame geometrical consideration can be applied to deep inelastic scattering processes if one\nassumes that a real or virtual photon converts into the vector meson according to the vector\ndominance model.\nFirst, we apply our model for the calculation of proton-proton and antiproton-proton\ncross sections at high energies and demonstrate that the growth of the cross section with\nenergy is caused by predominantly increasing contribution of peripheral interactions that,\nin turn, leads to the decreasing of inelasticity of collisions. Then we will show that the\nenergetic behaviour of inelasticity distributions governs the energetic behaviour of scaled\nmultiplicity distributions.\n\n\f8\nA.\n\nCross Sections\n\nTo calculate cross sections we used an impact parameter representation, namely Inelastic\nOverlap Function (IOF), which can be specified via the unitarity equation\n2Imf (s, b) = |f (s, b)|2 + Gin (s, b),\n\n(17)\n\nwhere f (s, b)\u2212elastic scattering amplitude and Gin (s, b) is IOF. IOF is connected with inelastic differential cross sections in impact parameter space:\n1\n(d\u03c3in /db2 ) = Gin (s, b).\n\u03c0\nThen the inelastic, elastic and total cross sections can be expressed via IOF as\nZ\n\u03c3in (s) = Gin (s, b)d2b,\nZ h\ni2\np\n\u03c3el (s) =\n1 \u2212 1 \u2212 Gin (s, b) d2 b,\nZ h\ni\np\n\u03c3tot (s) = 2\n1 \u2212 1 \u2212 Gin (s, b) d2 b.\n\n(18)\n\n(19)\n(20)\n(21)\n\nSince IOF relates to the probability of inelastic interaction at a given impact parameter, we\ncarried out Monte Carlo simulation of inelastic nucleon\u2013nucleon interactions. The Inelastic\ninteraction takes place at the definite impact parameter b if the produced mass meets the\nfollowing requirement:\n2\nMCF\n\n= 4MP \u03b3P MT \u03b3T\n\nZ\n\n2\n\u03c1P (r)\u03c1T (r \u2212 b) d3 r \u2265 (MCF\n)min,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere MCF is the mass of the central \"fireball\" produced at the ovelapped region, \u03c1P and\n\u03c1T are hadronic matter density distributions in projectile and target hadrons, MP , MT \u2013\n2\nmasses, \u03b3P , \u03b3T \u2013 gamma\u2013factors of the colliding hadrons and (MCF\n)min \u2013 the minimal mass of\n\na fireball that results in an inelastic event. This expression is the modification of assumption\nof Heisenberg [15] on interaction of extended particles: we replaced in his original formula\n2\nthe pion mass squared (on the right hand side) by (MCF\n)min. In our previous papers this\n\nquantity corresponded to the transverse mass of the pion: m2\u03c0\u22a5 = p2\u22a5 + m2\u03c0 . Taking into\naccount the energy dependence of the average momentum of produced particles and the\nincreasing yield of minijets (as treated in what follows) we parametrize the minimal fireball\nmass as\n(MCF )min = 0.3 + 0.03s1/4 .\n\n(23)\n\n\f9\nSpecifying the quark configurations in each colliding hadrons according to (15) we calculated Gin (s, b) for particular values of the impact parameter b and then according to (21) \u2013\ntotal cross sections, \u03c3tot . Fig. 5 shows the results of the calculation for total cross sections for\nproton \u2013 proton and antiproton \u2013 proton collisions in a wide range of collision energies. One\ncan see that the model with fixed parameters characterizing the geometrical size of hadrons\ndescribes the energetic behaviour of \u03c3tot rather well. The growth of the total cross section\nwith energy coming from the growth of the inelastic cross section is due to the continuous\ntails of condensates (hadronic matter distributions) around VQs not compensated by the\ndestructive interference effect inside each interacting particle. With rising collision energy\nthe overlap of more peripheral parts of these tails make it possible to meet requirement (22)\nand consequently results in the increasing effective size of the hadronic matter distribution\ninside nucleons and correspondingly the increasing radius of interactions. It can be seen\nfrom the comparison of IOFs for ISR and SPS energies which is given in Fig. 6. According\nS\nto Eq. (18) the difference GSP\n\u2212GISR\nexhibits the predominantly peripheral increase of the\nin\nin\n\ninelastic cross section (and thus of the total cross section, since \u03c3el / \u03c3tot is only about 20%)\nwhich is centered around 1 fm (Fig. 6b). As noted by the authors of the paper [17] at high\nenergies colliding nucleons become blacker, edger and larger (\"BEL\u2013effect\"). The model\n\u221a\ngives the linear logarithmic energy dependence for total cross sections. At energies s < 30\nGeV calculated cross sections were corrected on contributions of Regge poles exchange by\nusing Donnachie and Landshoff parametrization[18]. An oscillatory motion of VQs appearing as an interplay between constituent and bare (current) quark configurations results in\nfluctuations of the hadronic matter distribution inside colliding nucleons. The manifestation of these fluctuations is a variety of scattering processes, hard and soft, in particular, the\nprocess of single diffraction (SD). SD\u2013events correspond to the constituent quark configuration inside one colliding hadron and (semi)bare quark configuration inside the other one.\nOur unified geometrical explanation of diffractive, nondiffractive and DIS processes could\ngive an answer to the long standing question: what is pomeron? Historically the concept\nof \"Pomeron\" originating from simple Regge pole with the intercept a0 = 1 transformed\nto a rather complicated object with relatively arbitrary features and smooth meaning. To\nproduce the rising cross sections it must have the intercept such that a0 = 1 + \u03b5. The fact\nthat the parameter \u03b5 is universal, independent of particles being scattered in hadronic and\nDIS interactions, could say us that the nature of the cross section growth is the same for\n\n\f10\nall processes. Our interpretation of pomeron is a geometrical one. Both diffractive and\nnondiffractive particle productions emerge from the disturbance (excitation) of overlapped\ncontinuous vacuum polarization fields (gluon and qq condensate) around valence quarks of\ncolliding hadrons followed by fragmentation process. The type of the interaction depends\non quark configurations inside a colliding hadron occurring at the instant of the interaction\nand the value of the impact parameter. So, what we used to call \"Pomeron\" in t\u2212 channel\nis solely continuum states in s\u2212 channel and we claim that Pomeron is unique in elastic,\ninelastic (diffractive and nondiffractive) and DIS.\n\nB.\n\nMultiparticle Production in Hadronic Collisions\n\nAccording to our model the configurations with nonrelativistic constituent quarks ( x \u2243\nxmax ) inside the both colliding hadrons lead to soft interactions with multiparticle production\nin central and fragmentation regions. The additional restriction by small impact parameters\nselects central collisions when hadronic matter distributions of colliding hadrons (quarks)\noverlap totally. In this case kinetic energies of colliding hadrons dissipate totally converting\ninto the production of secondary particles that corresponds to collision inelasticity close to\n1 and very high multiplicity in comparison with the mean one. We will consider the soft\ninteractions and nondiffractive multiparticle production, in particular. According to the\nKNO hypothesis the scaled multiplicity distributions, hni Pn (s), depend on the ratio of the\nnumber of particles to the average multiplicity z = n/ hni and they are energy independent.\nFrom our geometrical point of view such behaviour could be explained as a superposition\nof relatively narrow distributions corresponding to the particular impact parameters of the\ncollisions. Indeed, the multiplicity distribution can be defined as\nZ 1\nPn (s) =\nP (n | k) P [k(s)]dk,\n\n(24)\n\n0\n\nwhere P [k(s)] is inelasticity distribution and P (n | k) is the probability of the production\nof n particles at the given inelasticity, k. So, if the conditional probability P (n | k) is\nsufficiently narrow then the shape of the distribution Pn is defined by the shape of the\ninelasticity distribution P [k(s)]. The inelasticity distributions are strictly connected with the\nimpact parameter distributions. KNO scaling holds (at least, approximately) if the impact\nparameter distributions and consequently inelasticity distributions are energy independent.\n\n\f11\nAs shown in the previous subsection the growth of inelastic and total cross sections with\nenergy in hadronic collisions is due to the increasing of effective sizes of interacting hadrons.\nTo make a quantitative analysis of energetic dependence of multiplicity distributions we\nperformed, in the frame of SCQM, Monte Carlo simulation of inelastic proton \u2013 proton\ninteractions selecting nondiffractive events. The process of simulation includes the following\nsteps.\n1. Applying Heisenberg prescription (22) we define the mass of the central \"fireball\" (CF)\n(Fig. 7) produced in the proton\u2013proton collision at a particular impact parameter.\nQuark configurations inside each proton at the instant of the collision is specified\nrandomly according to the probability (15) that allows one to fix energies and momenta\nof quarks inside both protons. Since the mass of CF is formed by the overlap of\nhadronic densities of individual constituent quarks (CQ) of colliding protons we know\nthe energies and momenta of quarks in both remnants which we call, by convention,\nforward and backward \"fireballs\" (FF and BF). The notion \"fireball\" is applied by\nconvention only because all fireballs, CF, FF and BF, can decay string \u2013 like manner\nand there is no sharp boundary between secondaries emitted from fireballs in the\nrapidity space for nondiffractive events. Then we calculate the effective masses of FF\nand BF (Fig. 7):\n\nMF F\n\nv\n!2\nu 3\nu X\n\u2032\nt\nEi \u2212\n=\ni=1\n\nMBF\n\nv\n!2\nu 6\nu X\n\u2032\n= t\nEi \u2212\ni=4\n\n\u2032\n\n3\nX\n6\nX\n\nki\n\n!2\n\n,\n\n(25)\n\nki\n\n!2\n\n,\n\n(26)\n\ni=1\n\ni=4\n\nwhere Ei and ki are energies and momenta of constituent quarks after the collision.\n2. We assume that each fireball breaks up, in general, into clusters.\n\nHere, the\n\nbremsstrahlung analogy is used, namely, at the instant of the collision a proton (electron) loses the energy dumping fraction of its hadronic (electromagnetic) field by means\nof the emission of clusters (photons). To simulate the masses of the clusters we apply\nthe result of the paper [19] for a cluster mass spectrum\nP (mcl ) = (mcl /m0 ) exp(\u2212mcl /m0 ),\n\n(27)\n\n\f12\nfollowing from the statistical nature of the cluster emission. Our next assumption is\nthat masses of clusters increase with the collision energy. This is dictated by the necessity to take into account such peculiarities of multiparticle production as the growth\nof rapidity distribution plateau, the increasing of transverse momenta of secondaries\nand the increasing yield of minijets. We parametrize the energy dependence of the\naverage mass of clusters as\nhmcl i = 0.3 + 0.09s1/4 .\n\n(28)\n\nNotice that we have chosen the same energetic dependence for the minimal fireball\nmass in Heisenberg prescription (23) except for the value of the slope parameter.\n3. Given the positions of the centers of masses of each fireball in rapidity space and\nkinematically allowed rapidity (sub)spaces for the breaking up of each fireball into\nclusters we simulate the momenta for each generated cluster in the proper frame of\nthe corresponding fireball. Bremsstrahlung mechanism of the fireball fragmentation\ncorresponds to statistically independent emission of clusters with the limited transverse\nmomenta. Therefore, we apply the cylindrical phase space model according to which\nthe rapidity of i -th cluster is defined as\nyi = \u03beYi ,\n\n(29)\n\nwhere \u03be is random number uniformly distributed in the interval [0,1]. The allowed\nrapidity interval, Yi , is given by\nYi = ln(MF2 /(\u03bccl )2i ,\nwhere (\u03bccl )2i = (mcl )2i + p2\u22a5i , transverse mass of the cluster i. Moreover, the rapidity\ninterval for fragmentation of the central fireball, YiCF , is restricted by the requirement\nYiCF \u2264 Y F F \u2212 Y BF ,\n\n(30)\n\nwhere Y F F and Y BF are rapidities of forward and backward fireball respectively. The\ntransverse momenta of the clusters are generated according to the distribution\nf (p2\u22a5 ) \u221d exp(\u2212bp2\u22a5 ).\n\n(31)\n\n\f13\nThe energy of the remnant baryon in the proper frame of FF (BF) is defined by the\nsummary energy of two quarks closest to each other in rapidity space, i.e. kinematic\ncharacteristics of the baryon are connected to those of \"diquark\".\n4. Since our clusters are identified with minijets they should decay in a jet-like manner.\nOne could assume that these minijets are formed by the fragmentation of the excited\nsea quark\u2013antiquark pair. Hence, we can approximate the spectrum of cluster decay\nusing data on the electron\u2013positron annihilation provided that the cluster mass is\n\u221a\nidentified with the center of mass energy of an electron and positron: mcl = se+ e\u2212 .\nOne can apply for this purpose any of appropriate Monte \u2013 Carlo generators. The axis\nof the decaying jet is generated to be directed isotropically. And, at last, the model\nmeets energy \u2013 momentum conservation requirements for all products of a reaction.\nCalculated in such a manner the multiplicity distributions in the KNO form and\nthe energetic dependence of the mean multiplicity for charged particles are shown in\nFigures 8 and 9. Given all characteristics of produced particles in the event we can\ncalculate inelasticity k2 (Eq. 2). Its distributions for pp\u2212 interactions at different\ncollision energies are shown in Fig. 10. The inelasticity distribution evolves with\nenergy in such a way that its maximum position shifts to the lower values of inelasticity at higher collision energies. It means that the higher is the collision energy the\nlower is the average inelasticity (Fig. 11). Analyzing the multiplicity distribution at\ndifferent energies one can see that its maximum position shifts to the lower values\nof scaled multiplicities and the contribution of high multiplicities increases while the\ncollision energy increases. According to Eq. (24) the multiplicity distribution can\nbe expressed via the conditional multiplicity distribution at particular inelasticity and\nthe inelasticity distribution. The conditional multiplicity distribution at the particular\ninelasticity, in turn, is built from multiplicities of clusters emitted from forward, backward and central fireballs and multiplicities going from the clusters' fragmentation. If\nthe inelasticity distribution and (average) mass of the clusters would not depend on\nthe collision energy then the scaled multiplicity distributions do not depend on energy\neither and KNO - scaling takes place. The shift of the position of the maximum of\nthe inelasticity distribution with the energy growth shifts the position of the scaled\nmultiplicity distribution. On the other hand, masses of clusters growing with collision\n\n\f14\nenergy lead to the narrowing of available rapidity space and, consequently, to the violation of Feynman scaling. This effect most obviously exhibiting at the inelasticities\nclose to 1 cause the lift of a multiplicity distribution tail at high multiplicities. To summarize we claim that the mean inelasticity decreases with energy, and the violation of\nKNO - scaling is a consequence of the growth of inelastic and total cross sections and\nof masses of emitted clusters with energy.\nThis research was partly supported by the Russian Foundation of Basics Research,\ngrant 01\u201307\u201390144.\n\n\f15\n\n[1] G.
