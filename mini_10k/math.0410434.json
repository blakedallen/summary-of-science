The fibre Fi is a compact manifold and Ji \u2282 R is a\nneighbourhood of 0.\n\u2022 The restriction of each metric gl to Zi = Fi \u00d7 Ji is a product metric\n(x, a) 7\u2212\u2192 \u03bdi,l (a) * gFi (x) + \u03bci,l (a) * da2\nsuch that \u03bdi,l (0) \u2192 0 and \u03bci,l (0) \u2192 \u221e as l \u2192 0.\nS\n\u2022 On the complement of i Fi \u00d7 {0} in M , the metrics gl converge to a Riemannian metric g0 .\nSpectral geometric properties of certain types of degenerating manifolds have been\nexamined by several authors, let us mention Colbois-Courtois [4], Chavel-Dodziuk\n[2] and Judge [14].\nWe consider the case of hyperbolic surfaces, which is the fundamental example of\nsuch a degeneration. Here M is an oriented surface of negative Euler characteristic,\nand the metrics gl are hyperbolic, chosen in such a way that there are finitely many\nclosed curves ci , geodesic with respect to all metrics, with the length li of each curve\nconverging to 0 as l decreases. On the complement of the distinguished curves, the\nsequence of metrics is required to converge to a hyperbolic metric.\nIn the description above, the geodesics ci correspond to the central fibres Fi \u00d7 {0}.\nThe collar lemma of hyperbolic geometry ensures that each ci has got a collar\nneighbourhood Zi = R/Z \u00d7 (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb), with the Riemannian metric on Zi being given\nby\n(x, a) 7\u2212\u2192 (l2i + a2 )dx2 + (l2i + a2 )\u22121 da2 .\nLet M\nSl denote the surface M equipped with the metric gl if l > 0, and let M0 =\nM \\ i ci carry the limit metric liml\u21920 gl . Note that M0 is a complete hyperbolic\nsurface by definition, which contains a pair of cusps for each i.\n\nFrom the point of view of spectral theory, this example was initially studied by\nSchoen-Wolpert-Yau [22], Colbois-Courtois [3] and by Hejhal [10], Ji [12] and Wolpert [25]. To exemplify how the spectrum may behave during this process, assume\nthat M is compact for the moment. Then M0 is of finite area but not compact. The\nspectrum of compact manifolds is purely discrete, whereas that of M0 is the union\nof finitely many eigenvalues in [0, 1/4), and the essential spectrum is [1/4, \u221e). It\nwas observed that the small eigenvalues of M0 are limits of eigenvalues of Ml as\nl \u2192 0, and the eigenvalues of Ml accumulate at each point in [1/4, \u221e). One also\ntries to obtain information on embedded eigenvalues in the essential spectrum of\nM0 by means of such an approximation [26].\nHejhal and Wolpert proved results on the behaviour of the Selberg Zeta function.\nOur motivation for this work was to extend one of these results.\nLet us recall the definition of the Selberg Zeta function. It is a meromorphic function\nZ on the complex plane, associated with a hyperbolic surface. In the domain\n{s \u2208 C | Re(s) > 1} it is given by an absolutely convergent product\nZ : s 7\u2212\u2192\n\nY\nc\n\nZc (s),\n\nwhere\n\nZc (s) :=\n2\n\n\u221e\nY\n\nk=0\n\n\u00012\n1 \u2212 e\u2212(s+k)l(c) .\n\n\fThe product ranges over the set of all unoriented, simple, closed geodesics c of\nthe surface, and l(c) denotes the length of c. Now if l(c) decreases as the metric\nchanges, we have (the precise asymptotics are given in lemma 3.22)\nZc (s) = O l(c)1\u22122 Re(s) e\u2212\u03c0\n\n2\n\n/3l(c)\n\n\u0001\n,\n\nl(c) \u2192 0.\n\nTherefore, one cannot expect to Selberg Zeta function of Ml to converge to that of\nthe limit M0 . In section 3.2 we prove\nTheorem. Consider a family Ml of degenerating surfaces,\nQ and let {ci } be the set\nof distinguished geodesics that are pinched. Then Z(s)/ i Zci (s) converges to the\nZeta function of the limit surface M0 if Re(s) > 1/2.\nThis is Wolpert's Conjecture 2 [25]. Hejhal proved that it holds in the domain of\nconvergence Re(s) > 1, and this was extended by Wolpert to a neighbourhood of\ns = 1. He also concluded from the functional equation of Z that the same cannot\nbe true in any domain that intersects {s \u2208 C | Re(s) < 1/2}, at least if the surfaces\nMl are compact.\nEach zero s of the Zeta function with Re(s) > 1/2 corrensponds to an eigenvalue\ns(1 \u2212 s) \u2208 [0, 1/4) of the Laplacian. We also prove Wolpert's Conjecture 1, which\nstates that one may divide out these zeroes from the quotient above to obtain\nuniform boundedness from below. It applies to geometrically finite surfaces of both\nfinite and infinite area.\nLet us elaborate a little on the proof of these statements. Analysis of the Selberg\nZeta function is based on the trace formula, which relates the logarithmic derivative\nof Z with the resolvent kernel of the Laplacian. Our primary object of investigation\nis the resolvent operator. The following theorem, proved throughout section 2,\nextends a result of Jorgenson and Lundelius [13] that arose as a consequence of\ntheir discussion of the heat kernel.\nTheorem. If t \u2208 C \\ [1/4, \u221e), let Rl (t) denote the pull-back of the resolvent (\u2206 \u2212\nt)\u22121 from Ml to M0 . Then Rl (t) converges to R0 (t) in the topology of continuous\nlinear maps L2 (M0 ) \u2192 L2loc (M0 ).\nRestriction to the vector space L2loc (M0 ) in the image of the resolvent means that\nwe prove convergence of the resolvent kernel on the complement of small neighbourhoods of the pinched geodesics. This restriction may be dropped if (\u2206 \u2212 t)\u22121 is\nreplaced with\nX\n(1)\n\u03c8i (\u2206Z\u0304i \u2212 t)\u22121 \u03c6i ,\n(\u2206 \u2212 t)\u22121 \u2212\ni\n\n\u22121\n\nwhere (\u2206Z\u0304i \u2212 t) denotes the resolvent on an infinite cylinder Z\u0304i that admits an\nisometric embedding Zi \u2192 Z\u0304i . The functions \u03c8i , \u03c6i are suitable cut-off functions\nsuch that the operator is defined. We prove that if two operators like (1) with\ndifferent values of t are considered, their difference converges in the trace class\ntopology. This immediately implies our results on the Zeta function.\nThe notion of convergence in the previous theorem is to be understood in the\nfollowing sense: The map t 7\u2192 Rl (t) is meromorphic on C \\ [1/4, \u221e) with possibly\nfinitely many poles of finite rank in [0, 1/4). If t0 is not a pole of R0 , then there exist\nneighbourhoods V of t0 and U of 0 such that Rl has no poles in V for all l \u2208 U,\nand convergence holds uniformly in V . So if C is a closed curve in the complement\nof the discrete spectrum of R0 , then the Riesz-projector\nI\n1\n\u2212\nRl (t) dt\n2\u03c0i C\n3\n\n\fconverges to that of R0 as l \u2192 0. In particular, we obtain an alternative proof of\nthe convergence of small eigenvalues for degenerating surfaces [3].\nTo prove the previous theorem, we apply a technique that is typically used to\nestablish a continuation of the resolvent kernel for M0 , across the essential spectrum\n[1/4, \u221e), to a branched cover of C. More precisely, we use meromorphic Fredholm\ntheory to compose the resolvent of a geometrically finite surface from those for a\ncompact surface and for elementary quotients of the hyperbolic plane. If Re(s) >\n1/2, and s(1 \u2212 s) is not an eigenvalue von \u2206, then the following equation holds,\nwhere \u2206i denotes the Laplacian of an auxiliary surface:\n\u0011\n\u0010X\n(2)\n\u03c8i (\u2206i \u2212 s(1 \u2212 s))\u22121 \u03c6i (1 + K(s))\u22121 .\n(\u2206 \u2212 s(1 \u2212 s))\u22121 =\ni\n\nHere (1 + K(s)) denotes a meromorphically invertible family of Fredholm operators.\nThis formula gives the information needed to deduce convergence of the resolvent\nfrom that of its constituent parts.\nNow the right-hand side of equation (2) is known to have a continuation in s to\nthe complex plane. In view of this analytic continuation, it would be interesting\nto obtain similar results on the left of the critical axis {s \u2208 C | Re(s) = 1/2}. But\nobviously the continuation is symmetric in s and 1 \u2212 s for compact surfaces, while\nthere is no such trivial relation in the other cases. To overcome this symmetry, we\nintroduce approximate Eisenstein functions for Ml as follows.\nRecall that the definition of Eisenstein functions is based on certain eigenfunctions\nof the Laplacian on a cusp Zk\u2212 \u2282 M0 , where\nZk\u2212 := R/Z \u00d7 (\u2212\u01eb, 0) \u2282 Zk\ncarries the metric (x, a) 7\u2192 a2 dx2 + a\u22122 da2 . In these coordinates, the functions are\ngiven by\n\u2212s\nh(0, s) : Zk\u2212 \u2212\u2192 C, (x, a) 7\u2212\u2192 |a| .\n\nThe number 0 in h(0, s) refers to the 'diameter' of a cusp. In section 3.1 we define\nfunctions h(l(k), s) : Zk\u2212 \u2192 C that depend on the length l(k) > 0 of the closed\ngeodesic in Zk . The corresponding notion of approximate Eisenstein functions on\nMl then consists of a meromorphic family of functions associated with each halfcylinder Zk\u00b1 \u2282 Zk . Up to a jump discontinuity on the respective closed geodesic,\nthey are eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on Ml . In this introduction they shall be\ndenoted by Ei (s), where i runs through the set S\u0303 of half-cylinders.\nIn this context, the classical scattering matrix is replaced with a pair of matrices\n(Cij (s))i,j\u2208S\u0303 and (Dij (s))i,j\u2208S\u0303 with the following properties: On each half-cylinder\nZj\u2212 we may define fibrewise Fourier coefficients Fjn , and the approximate Eisenstein\nfunctions Ei (s) satisfy\nFj0 Ei (s) = Dij (s) * h(l(j), s) + Cij (s) * h(l(j), 1 \u2212 s).\nThen, in consequence of convergence of the resolvent, we obtain\nTheorem.\n1. As l \u2192 0, the approximate Eisenstein function Ei (s) on Ml converge to Eisenstein functions for M0 if Re(s) > 1/2.\n2. If Re(s) > 1/2, the matrix (Cij (s))ij converges to the scattering matrix of\nM0 .\nLet us mention that the first part of this theorem in particular implies that the\nEisenstein functions Ei (s) on Ml , defined if the latter has cusps, converge to Eisenstein functions of the limit if Re(s) > 1/2. Results of this kind were used by Obitsu\n[19] to study the geometry of Teichm\u00fcller spaces.\n4\n\n\fBut the approximate Eisenstein functions do not immediately accomplish the problem of extending the convergence results to {s \u2208 C | Re(s) < 1/2}. Rather, they\nsatisfy a Mass-Selberg relation that gives rise to functional equations for surfaces of\nfinite area. These can be used to prove the following assertion. Here E(s) denotes\nthe column vector that has the approximate Eisenstein functions as entries.\nCorollary. Assume that the surfaces Ml are of finite area. For l near 0, the\nmeromorphic family of matrices D : s 7\u2192 (Dij (s)) is meromorphically invertible.\nThen D(s)\u22121 * E(s) and D(s)\u22121 * C(s) converge on {s \u2208 C | Re(s) 6= 1/2} to the\nEisenstein functions and the scattering matrix of M0 , respectively.\nQ\nThe corollary suggests a replacement for the quotient Z(s)/ i Zci (s) in the first\ntheorem, namely\nQ\ndet D(s) * Z(s)/ i Zci (s).\n\nThe additional factor does not alter the limit if Re(s) > 1/2, and we prove in\nTheorem 3.23 that this expression also converges to the Zeta function of M0 if\nRe(s) < 1/2 for a degenerating family of compact surfaces. It is in this sense, that\nthe approximate scattering data admit an extension of the first theorem to the left\nof the critical axis. Unfortunately we do not know how this term behaves on the\ncritical axis itself.\nThe text is arranged as follows: In section 1, we give an explicit description of\nthe metric degeneration in terms of Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates. It comes with a\nconvenient choice of coordinates for elementary cylinders that are embedded in the\nsurfaces, and these coordinates are the basis for our comparison of integral kernels\nlater on. Section 2 is divided into two parts. After a few remarks on compact\nsurfaces, the first part uses the resolvent kernel of the Laplacian on the hyperbolic\nplane to compare the kernels for elementary surfaces of different diameters. The\nmain difficulty is to obtain trace class estimates that carry over to general surfaces of\nfinite geometry. The second part applies meromorphic Fredholm theory to examine\nthese surfaces. Approximate Eisenstein series are described in section 3.1, and in\nsection 3.2 we apply our results to the Selberg Zeta function.\nFrom the year 2000 on I was a member of the DFG research group \"Zetafunktionen\nund lokalsymmetrische R\u00e4ume\", located at Clausthal-Zellerfeld and G\u00f6ttingen, and\nof the Graduate Program \"Gruppen und Geometrie\". I am very grateful to the\nmembers of these groups for their support. But first and foremost I want to express\nmy thanks to Prof. Dr. Ulrich Bunke. He raised my interest in this subject, and he\nwas of great influence on me during the past years. I also want to thank Dr. Martin\nOlbrich and Dr. Margit R\u00f6sler for their help.\n\n1\n\nSurface geometry\n\nA collection of 3p \u2212 3 incontractible, simple, closed curves that are disjoint and\nhomotopically distinct may be used to dissect a closed, oriented surface of genus p \u2265\n2 into pairs of pants. Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates as gluing data for hyperbolic pairs\nof pants determine a hyperbolic surface of the same genus. Such a decomposition\nof hyperbolic surfaces will be applied to examine their degeneration in the sections\nto come.\nTo introduce some notation, we begin with giving an explicit construction for a\nfamily of extended pairs of pants. These are extended in the sense that they are\nnot compact, but the removal of infinite cylinders will result in the common pairs\nor pants, which have a boundary consisting of three closed geodesics. The family\nprovides the building blocks for general surfaces of finite geometry, and it also serves\nas the fundamental example for the degeneration process.\n5\n\n\fv2\n\nT2\n1\n2 l1\n\nl1\n\n1\n2 l3\n\nl3\n\nL1\nL3\n\nv3\nL2\nT3\n\nT1\n\n1l\n2 2\n\nl2\n\nv1\n\nFigure 1: Construction of a pair of pants with prescribed circumference of funnels.\n\n1.1\n\nA degenerating family of pairs of pants\n\nTopologically, the surfaces are thrice punctured spheres, so their fundamental group\nis the free group on two generators Z\u2217Z. To provide such a one carrying a hyperbolic\nstructure, we specify the generators of a Fuchsian group that is isomorphic to Z \u2217 Z.\nUp to conjugation within the orientation preserving isometries of the hyperbolic\nplane, the Fuchsian group is determined by a triple of three nonnegative numbers,\nof which every positive stands for the length of a closed geodesic. In case at least\none of the lengths vanishes, we speak of a degeneration.\nFor the time being, we use the unit disc model D of the hyperbolic plane. Hyperbolic\ndistance between z1 , z2 \u2208 D is denoted by d(z1 , z2 ). To determine a conjugacy class\nfor the groups to be constructed, fix three distinct points that occur in the order\nv1 , v2 , v3 on \u2202D, the indices will be taken as elements of Z/3Z. Let Li denote the\ngeodesic line that joins vi+1 with vi+2 .\n1.1 Lemma. Any triple (l1 , l2 , l3 ) of non-negative reals determines disjoint geodesics T1 , T2 , T3 \u2282 D with the following properties (cf. figure 1).\n1. Each Ti meets \u2202D at vi and the geodesic Li\u22121 separates Ti from Li .\n2. The number li /2 is equal to the hyperbolic distance d(Ti+1 , Ti+2 ).\nIn fact, Ti is the unique geodesic with the first property that satisfies\n\u22121\n\ncosh(d(Ti , Li )) = (cosh(li /2) + 1)\n\n[m(l1 , l2 , l3 ) + cosh(li+2 /2) \u2212 cosh(li+1 /2)]\n(3)\n\nwhere\nm(l1 , l2 , l3 ) = cosh2 (l1 /2) + cosh2 (l2 /2) + cosh2 (l3 /2)\n\u00011/2\n.\n+2 cosh(l1 /2) cosh(l2 /2) cosh(l3 /2) \u2212 1\n\nProof. It is convenient to consider this as a statement on the inversive product of\nspheres in the extended\nplane R\u03022 . The set of spheres is identified with a subset of\n\b\n2\nRP 3 by mapping x \u2208 R2 | a0 kxk \u2212 2hx , (a1 , a2 )i + a3 = 0 to the equivalence\nclass of (a0 , a1 , a2 , a3 ). With the bilinear form q(a, b) = 2(a1 b1 + a2 b2 ) \u2212 a0 b3 \u2212 a3 b0 ,\nthe inversive product of two spheres S and T , represented by a, b \u2208 RP 3 , is defined\nto be (cf. Beardon [1, p. 28ff ])\n(S, T ) =\n\n|q(a, b)|\n\n|q(a, a)|\n6\n\n1/2\n\n|q(b, b)|\n\n1/2\n\n.\n\n\fNow, given spheres L1 , L2 , L3 and T1 , T2 , T3 as in the proposition with property\n1, one can compute (Ti , Li ) from (Ti , Ti+1 ) and (Ti+1 , Li+1 ):\n(Ti , Li ) =\n\n2 ((Ti , Ti+1 ) + (Ti+1 , Li+1 ))\n\u2212 1.\n1 + (Ti+1 , Li+1 )\n\nThe formula can be verified conveniently in the upper half plane with {v1 , v2 , v3 } =\n{0, 1, \u221e} since the inversive product is invariant under M\u00f6bius transformations.\nThis gives a system of three equations, solved by the (non-negative) inversive products (Ti , Li ) if and only if\nh\n\u22121\n(Ti , Li ) = ((Ti+1 , Ti+2 ) + 1) * (Ti , Ti+1 ) \u2212 (Ti , Ti+2 )\ni\np\n+ (T1 , T2 )2 + (T2 , T3 )2 + (T3 , T1 )2 + 2(T1 , T2 )(T2 , T3 )(T3 , T1 ) \u2212 1 .\n\nFinally, if the intersections of two spheres S,T with D are disjoint geodesics, we\nhave (S, T ) = cosh d(S \u2229 D, T \u2229 D). So the previous equation calculates (Ti , Li )\nfrom l1 , l2 , l3 , and this in turn determines Ti .\n\u0003\n\nIn view of this lemma, the set B0 := [0, \u221e)3 now serves as parameter space for\nFuchsian groups. Each point (l1 , l2 , l3 ) \u2208 B0 gives rise to geodesics Ti . Let \u03c3i denote\nreflection in Ti and \u03b3i = \u03c3i+2 \u03c3i+1 . Then \u03b3i , \u03b3i+1 act as side-pairing transformations\non the convex polygon bounded by Ti , Ti+1 , \u03c3i+2 Ti and \u03c3i+2 Ti+1 . Observe that \u03b3i\nis a parabolic isometry of D if Ti+2 and Ti+1 meet in vi+2 , i.e. if li = 0. Otherwise\nit is a hyperbolic transformation of translation length li , its axis being the common\northogonal of Ti+2 and Ti+1 .\nThe group generated by \u03b31 , \u03b32 , \u03b33 has a presentation h\u03b31 , \u03b32 , \u03b33 | 1 = \u03b33 \u03b32 \u03b31 i, and\nPoincar\u00e9's theorem implies that it is a discrete group of isometries. We fix the\nisomorphism of Z \u2217 Z onto this group that maps the natural generators to \u03b31 , \u03b32 .\nEquation (3) shows that we constructed a family\n\u03c6:\n\nB0 \u2212\u2192 hom(Z \u2217 Z, isom(D))\n\nthat is smooth even on the boundary of B0 .\nEach of the generators \u03b31 , \u03b32 , \u03b33 corresponds to a cylinder embedded in the quotient\nY0 (l) := \u03c6(l)\\D. General surfaces will be defined by a gluing procedure along the\ncylinders, and we need to choose suitable coordinates. For this purpose, the following models of the hyperbolic plane are used. The Riemannian metrics are special\ncases of those employed by Judge [14] in his study of the spectrum of degenerating\nmanifolds of more general geometry.\n1.2 Definition. For each positive real number t, let Xt denote the manifold R2\nendowed with the Riemannian metric\n(x, a) 7\u2212\u2192 (t2 + a2 )dx2 + (t2 + a2 )\u22121 da2 .\nFor t = 0 we consider the disconnected manifold\n\b\nXt = X0 = (x, a) \u2208 R2 | a 6= 0 , (x, a) 7\u2212\u2192 a2 dx2 + a\u22122 da2 .\n\nWe shall also use the notation Xt\u00b1 = {(x, a) \u2208 Xt | \u00b1 a > 0}, and more generally,\nfor arbitrary subsets A \u2282 R, the set {(x, a) \u2208 Xt | a \u2208 A} is denoted by XtA .\nThe plane Xt , if t 6= 0, is mapped isometrically onto the upper half-plane model for\nthe hyperbolic plane by\n\u0013\n\u0012\nt\na\n,\n, \u221a\n(x, a) 7\u2212\u2192 etx \u221a\nt2 + a 2\nt2 + a 2\n7\n\n\fand so is X0\u00b1 by (x, a) 7\u2192 (x, \u00b1a\u22121 ). The map\n\u03b3 : Xt \u2212\u2192 Xt ,\n\n(x, a) 7\u2212\u2192 (x + 1, a)\n\ncorresponds to a hyperbolic isometry of translation t in the first case and to a\nparabolic one in the second. So the quotient Zt := h\u03b3i\\Xt is either an elementary\nhyperbolic cylinder or the disjoint union of two cusps.\nIt is convenient to denote subsets of Zt by Zt\u00b1 and ZtA as in definition 1.2. The\nfollowing lemma is essentially the collar lemma from hyperbolic geometry. The\ndefinition of A(t) therein is only a preliminary, cf. (4).\n1.3 Lemma. Let l = (l1 , l2 , l3 ) \u2208 B0 , and for all t \u2265 0 we put\n(\n\u0001\nt\n\u2212 2 sinh(t/2)\n, \u221e if t > 0,\nA(t) =\n(\u22121, 0)\nif t = 0.\nThen the construction of lemma 1.1 gives rise to canonical embeddings of cylinders\nA(li )\n\n\u2212\u2192 Y0 (l)\n\n\u03a8 i : Z li\n\nA(li ) \u0001\n\nsuch that the images Ci (l) := \u03a8i Zli\n\nare mutually disjoint.\n\nProof. Any pair (S1 , S2 ) of disjoint geodesics with positive distance t/2 determines\nan orientation-preserving isometry of Xt onto D. It maps {(x, a) | x = 0} to S1 and\n{(x, a) | x = 1/2} to S2 . In case the geodesics are disjoint with distance t/2 = 0,\nit may be necessary to interchange S1 and S2 , but then there is a unique isometry\nX0\u2212 \u2192 D with the same property. We apply this to the geodesics that are associated\nwith (l1 , l2 , l3 ) by Lemma 1.1: Each pair (Ti+1 , Ti+2 ) of geodesics gives rise to\nA(l ) \u0001\n\u03a8\u0303i : Xli \u2192 D (or \u03a8\u0303i : X0\u2212 \u2192 D, respectively). The set \u03a8\u0303i Xli i \u2282 D is precisely\ninvariant under the action of h\u03b3i i \u2282 Z \u2217 Z (this is one way of proving the collar\nlemma). Then the \u03a8\u0303i induce maps \u03a8i between the quotients as proposed.\n\u0003\nSo we defined a connected hyperbolic surface Y0 (l) for each l \u2208 B0 with distinA(l )\nguished subsets C1 , C2 , C3 . Each Ci is diffeomorphic to a cylinder Zli i , and a\npoint p \u2208 Ci ist given, via the map \u03a8i , by coordinates p = (x, a) where x \u2208 R is\nA(l )\nwell-defined modulo Z. The image of Zl+i \u2229 Zli i under \u03a8i is\nCi+ = {(x, a) \u2208 Ci | a > 0},\nS\nand the interior P (l) of the set Y0 (l) \\ 3i=1 Ci+ is an open pair of pants in the\ncustomary sense of this word. Note that Ci+ is empty by definition if li = 0.\n\n1.2\n\nAssembling a surface from pairs of pants\n\nWe describe the gluing procedure that composes a geometrically finite surface from\npairs of pants. Our presentation follows that of Kra's article on horocyclic coordinates [15], with focus on Riemannian geometry rather than complex structure. It\nincorporates a choice of local coordinates for embedded cylinders, which are modelled after lemma 1.3.\nStarting point is an admissible graph G of type (p, n). Basically, it determines the\ntopological structure of the surface to be constructed, which will be of genus p\nwith n deleted discs in the non-degenerate case. The graph consists of a set G0 of\nvertices, a set G\u03031 of oriented edges, an involution \u03b9 of G\u03031 without fixed elements, and\na map s : G\u03031 \u2192 G0 that associates the source to every edge.

The numbers p, n \u2208 N0 satisfy 2p \u2212 2 + n > 0 and\n3p \u2212 3 + n \u2265 0 by definition. The number of vertices is 2p \u2212 2 + n, the number of\nunoriented edges is 3p \u2212 3 + n, and the preimage of any q \u2208 G0 under s consists of\nthree edges at most.\nIt is convenient to introduce additional edges that do not belong to the domain of\ndefinition of the involution \u03b9. They correspond to infinite funnels, i.e. cylinders with\nonly one end attached to a pair of pants.\n1.4 Definition. An augmented admissible graph G\u2217 consists of a set G0 of vertices,\na set G\u0303\u22171 of oriented edges, a source map s : G\u0303\u22171 \u2192 G0 , and a distinguished subset\nG\u03031 \u2282 G\u0303\u22171 with an involution \u03b9 of G\u03031 such that\n\u0001\n\u2022 the tuple G\u03031 , G0 , s|G\u03031 , \u03b9 is an admissible graph,\n\u2022 for each vertex q \u2208 G0 , the preimage s\u22121 (q) \u2282 G\u0303\u22171 consists of exactly three\nelements.\n\nThe set G\u22171 of unoriented edges is the quotient of G\u0303\u22171 under the equivalence relation\ngenerated by e \u223c \u03b9(e), and the elements of G\u0303\u22171 \\ G\u03031 are called phantom edges.\nIf G\u2217 is an augmented admissible graph, we may choose a map\nG0 \u2212\u2192 G\u0303\u22171 \u00d7 G\u0303\u22171 \u00d7 G\u0303\u22171 ,\n\nq 7\u2212\u2192 (q1 , q2 , q3 ),\n\nthat assigns all three adjacent edges to each vertex. Now a surface YG (\u03bb) with a\nhyperbolic metric is determined by a labelling \u03bb of the edges of G\u2217 with length and\ntwist parameters as follows. Let\n\u03bb : G\u22171 \u2212\u2192 [0, \u221e) \u00d7 R,\n\nd 7\u2212\u2192 (l(d), \u03c4 (d))\n\nbe an arbitrary map. The lift of \u03bb to G\u0303\u22171 is also denoted by \u03bb. We consider a pair\nof pants\nPq := {q} \u00d7 P (l(q1 ), l(q2 ), l(q3 ))\nfor each vertex q \u2208 G0 as defined at the end of section 1.1, and an infinite elementary\nhalf-cylinder or a cusp\n\u0011\n\u0010\nA(l(e))\n+\n\u222a Zl(e)\nZe := {e} \u00d7 Zl(e)\n9\n\n\ffor each phantom edge e \u2208 G\u0303\u22171 \\ G\u03031 . These half-cylinders will be attached to ends of\nthe Pq , while additional collars will serve as connectors between the remaining ends\nof pairs of pants. To define these connectors, we alter the definition of the interval\nA(t) from previous subsection into a more symmetric one,\n(\n\u0001\nt\nt\n, 2 sinh(t/2)\n\u2212 2 sinh(t/2)\nif t 6= 0,\nA(t) :=\n(4)\n(\u22121, 1)\nif t = 0.\nThis allows for the definition of a collar Ze , for each proper edge e \u2208 G\u03031 , by\nA(l(e))\n\nZe := {e} \u00d7 Zl(e)\n\n,\n\nwhich is indeed a collar around a closed geodesic if l(e) 6= 0.\nNow we define YG (\u03bb) by an equivalence relation, where the coordinates we use on\nZe and on Ci\u2212 \u2282 Pq are the canonical ones induced by definition 1.2 and lemma 1.3.\n1.5 Definition. Let B be the set of maps G\u22171 \u2212\u2192 [0, \u221e) \u00d7 R. For each \u03bb = (l, \u03c4 ) \u2208\nB, let YG (\u03bb) be the surface defined by\n\u0012 [\n\u0013\n[\nYG (\u03bb) =\n(5)\nZe / \u223c,\nPq \u222a\nq\u2208G0\n\ne\u2208G\u0303\u2217\n1\n\nwith the equivalence relation being generated as follows:\n(x, a) \u223c (x \u2212 \u03c4 (qi )/2, a)\n(x, a) \u223c (\u2212x, \u2212a)\n\nwhere (x, a) \u2208 Ci\u2212 \u2282 Pq ,\n\n(x \u2212 \u03c4 (qi )/2, a) \u2208 Zq\u2212i \u2282 Zqi ;\n\nwhere (x, a) \u2208 Ze , (\u2212x, \u2212a) \u2208 Z\u03b9(e) .\n\nThe first relation glues a cylinder to each end Ci\u2212 of a pair of pants Pq , and the\nsecond identifies two such cylinders Ze , Z\u03b9(e) according to the structure of the\ngraph. Recall that the involution \u03b9 is defined on the proper edges in G\u03031 only, so the\ncondition for the second generator is never satisfied if e is a phantom edge.\nFrom now on, the notation Pq and Ze will refer to the respective images in the\nquotient YG (\u03bb). Then Ze = Z\u03b9(e) for each proper edge e, and we may speak of\na subset Zd \u2282 YG (\u03bb) for each unoriented edge d \u2208 G\u22171 . Note the following: The\nchoice of an orientation e \u2208 G\u0303\u22171 of d endows the cylinder Zd with a canonical\nA\nquotient structure h\u03b3i\\Xl(e)\n. Replacing e with \u03b9(e) corresponds to the coordinate\nchange (x, a) 7\u2192 (\u2212x, \u2212a). In particular, we may use oriented edges to specify\n\u2213\nhalf-cylinders Ze\u00b1 \u2282 Zd , and Ze\u00b1 = Z\u03b9(e)\nholds. This will be of importance in the\ndefinition of approximate Eisenstein series in section 3.1.\nThe Pq and Zd provide an open cover of YG (\u03bb) as illustrated in figure 2. If the\nadmissible graph is of type (0, 3), then the extended pairs of pants Y0 (l), as defined\nin the previous paragraph, occur as the non-elementary component of YG (\u03bb), and\nYG (\u03bb) is not connected if a length l(d) vanishes. In this instance, the edge d gives\nrise to an isolated cusp Zd+ \u2282 YG . The reader is advised to have a look at Kra's\ntext [15] for a discussion of several graph types.\nThe quotient YG (\u03bb) inherits a hyperbolic metric. Obviously, there exists an isometry\nbetween the emerging surfaces if a twist \u03c4 (d) is replaced with \u03c4 (d) + 1 (or with\n\u03c4 (d) + \u03b4 for arbitrary \u03b4 if d \u2208 G\u22171 \\ G1 ).\n\n10\n\n\f1.3\n\nChoice of a trivialisation\n\nIn section 2 we will need maps between surfaces YG (\u03bb) for different values of \u03bb,\nand these will be constructed here. In definition 1.2, the identity mapping on R2\ndescends to diffeomorphisms between the surfaces Zt+ \u222a Zt\u2212 as t varies in [0, \u221e). We\nwant our maps to coincide with these canonical maps on the cylinders embedded in\nYG (\u03bb). What we do is to define such maps for each pair of pants Pq (and possibly\nits adjacent infinite half-cylinders) separately. They do not necessarily extend to a\ndiffeomorphism near a closed geodesic where two pairs of pants meet. But this is\nsufficient for our needs as it yields operators on L2 -spaces that are strongly continous\nwith respect to the geometry.\nSo we start with choosing suitable diffeomorphisms for the extended pairs of pants\nY0 (l) of subsection 1.1. Recall that we have B0 = [0, \u221e)3 , and \u03c6 maps B0 to the\nmonomorphisms of Z \u2217 Z into the isometries of the hyperbolic plane D. There is a\nfibre space in analogy with the Bers fibre space in Teichm\u00fcller theory:\n1.6 Definition. Let E \u03030 := B0 \u00d7 D and \u03c1\u0303 : E \u03030 \u2192 B0 be the canonical map. Then we\ndefine E0 := (Z \u2217 Z)\\\u1ebc0 and \u03c1 : E0 \u2192 B0 to be the map induced by \u03c1\u0303, where Z \u2217 Z\nacts on E \u03030 by \u03b3(l, z) = (l, \u03c6(l)(\u03b3)z).\nThe Z \u2217 Z-action on \u1ebc0 is smooth, and we refer to lemma A.1 for a proof that it is\nfreely discontinuous. So E0 is a smooth manifold. The group acts on each fibre of\n\u03c1\u0303, so \u03c1 is well-defined, and \u03c1\u22121 (l) \u223c\n= Y0 (l).\nThe aim is to equip \u03c1 locally with a trivialisation that exhibits a specific behaviour\non the infinite ends of the fibres. This behaviour is modelled on the canonical map\ninduced by the identity on Zt+ \u222a Zt\u2212 by means of lemma 1.3:\nLet us fix j \u2208 {1, 2, 3} for a moment. Differentiation of each map \u03a8i with respect\nto lj defines a smooth vector field sji on the open subset\n[\n{l} \u00d7 Ci (l) \u2282 E0\nl\n\nsuch that sji \u2212 \u2202lj is tangent to the fibre of \u03c1. Then discontinuity of the Z \u2217 Z-action\non \u1ebc0 implies the existence of a smooth vector field sj on E0 such that sj \u2212 \u2202lj is\nagain vertical with respect to \u03c1, the restriction of sj to each subset {l} \u00d7 Ci (l) being\nequal to sji .\nIf we agree on the order, in which the integral flows of s1 , s2 and s3 are to be\napplied, they can be used to \"trivialise\" \u03c1. With reference to appendix A for the\ndetails, we only state the outcome in the proposition below. Here P (l) \u2282 \u03c1\u22121 (l)\nagain denotes the embedded pair of pants.\n1.7 Proposition. For each l \u2208 B0 there exists a neighbourhood U of l and a smooth\nmap\n\u03a8 : U \u00d7 P (l) \u2212\u2192 E0\n(6)\nwith the following properties:\n\n\u2022 For all l\u2032 \u2208 U, the set P (l\u2032 ) \u2282 \u03c1\u22121 (l\u2032 ) is the diffeomorphic image of {l\u2032 }\u00d7P (l).\nA(l\u2032i )\n\n\u2022 Via the identification of Ci (l\u2032 ) with Zl\u2032\n\ni\n\nin lemma 1.3, the map\n\n\u03a8(l\u2032 , *) : Ci (l) \u2212\u2192 P (l\u2032 )\ncorresponds to the canonical identification of ZlIi with ZlI\u2032 , where I is the\ni\nintersection of A(li ) with A(l\u2032i ). In particular, this restriction to ZlIi is areapreserving, since the volume form on Xl\u2032 is the Euclidean one for all l\u2032 .\n11\n\n\f\u2022 If the degeneracies of \u03c1\u22121 (l\u2032 ) coincide with those of \u03c1\u22121 (l), that is to say, if\nl\u2032i = 0 implies li = 0 and vice versa, then the integral flows extend this map\nto a diffeomorphism \u03a8(l\u2032 ) : \u03c1\u22121 (l) \u2192 \u03c1\u22121 (l\u2032 ).\nNow let G be an arbitrary admissible graph. To compare YG (\u03bb\u2032 ) with YG (\u03bb), we apply the trivialising maps from proposition 1.7 to each Pq with its adjacent cylinders\nZq\u2212i separately. Thus, if U (\u03bb) \u2282 YG (\u03bb) is the complement of all closed geodesics that\nare associated with elements of G\u22171 , there is a distinguished map U (\u03bb) \u2192 YG (\u03bb\u2032 ).\nThis map is a diffeomorphism onto the corresponding set U (\u03bb\u2032 ). The pull-back\nmetric has a unique extension to YG (\u03bb) if there are no additional degeneracies in\nYG (\u03bb\u2032 ), and these metrics match up to form a continuous family with respect to \u03bb\u2032 .\n\n1.4\n\nThe Selberg Zeta function in its domain of convergence\n\nThe result proved here is a prerequisite for section 3.2. It only requires the construction from the first two sections, so we include this assertion here. It makes use\nof a standard procedure to estimate the number of prime closed geodesics in a hyperbolic surface that also proves convergence of the infinite product in the definition\nof the Zeta function. The argument is essentially due to Hejhal [10], but we skip\nthe notion of regular b-groups and consider arbitrary surfaces of finite geometry.\nLet G be an admissible graph of type (p, n) and G\u2217 its augmentation. The graph\nwill remain fixed. Let Z\u03bb denote the Selberg Zeta function of the surface Y (\u03bb) =\nYG (\u03bb), which is the product of the Zeta functions of all connected components. The\ncontribution of an elementary cusp to Z\u03bb is trivial by definition.\nFor each d \u2208 G\u22171 and \u03bb = (l, \u03c4 ) \u2208 B with l(d) 6= 0, an entire function Zd,\u03bb is defined\nby the infinite product\nZd,\u03bb : s 7\u2212\u2192\n\n\u221e \u0010\nY\n\nk=0\n\n1 \u2212 e\u2212(s+k)l(d)\n\n\u00112\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\nThis product is absolutely convergent. We extend this definition to l(d) = 0 by\nputting Zd,\u03bb = 1 in that case. The purpose of this section is to prove the following\nassertion.\n1.8 Proposition. With respect to the topology of locally uniform\nconvergence of anQ\nalytic functions on {s \u2208 C | Re(s) > 1}, the map \u03bb 7\u2192 Z\u03bb / d\u2208G\u2217 Zd,\u03bb is continuous\n1\non B.\nThe basic idea is the following elementary estimate: If Y is a compact, connected\nhyperbolic surface, let N (r) be the number of closed geodesics on Y of length at\nmost r. Then there exists C > 0 such that N (r) \u2264 Cer holds for all r > 0. The\nconstant C is given explicitly in terms of area and diameter of a fundamental domain\nfor a uniformising group.\nIn our situation we must not assume that a family of Fuchsian groups has fundamental domains of uniformly bounded diameter as cusps emerge. But each closed\ngeodesic that is not entirely contained in a cylinder must meet a certain fixed subset\nof the surface, and it is sufficient that this subset has uniformly bounded diameter.\nTo make this precise, we choose uniformising groups and fundamental domains for\nall YG (\u03bb).\nAs YG (\u03bb) may have several non-elementary components, it is convenient to have\none group \u0393q (\u03bb) at hand, for each vertex q \u2208 G0 , that is a uniformizing group for\nthe component that contain a pair of pants Pq . So let q \u2208 G0 be a vertex with the\n12\n\n\f\u2032\ngTj+1\n\n\u03c33 T2\n\nT3\n\n\u03c33 T1\n\n\u03c4 *l\n\n\u03b3i\n\n\u2032\ngTj+2\n\nFqA\n\nTi+2\n\nT2\n\nT1\nTi+1\nSi\n\nFigure 3: Amalgamated free product/HNN-extension and the set FqA .\nadjacent edges q1 , q2 , q3 \u2208 G\u0303\u22171 . For each \u03bb = (l, \u03c4 ) \u2208 B we defined in 1.1 geodesics\nT1 , T2 , T3 \u2282 D such that their distances satisfy\nd(Ti+1 , Ti+2 ) = l(qi )/2,\nand a Fuchsian group \u2206q = \u03c6(l(q1 ), l(q2 ), l(q3 )) with generators \u03b31 , \u03b32 , \u03b33 . If l(qi ) 6=\n0 and \u03b9(qi ) = qj\u2032 for some q \u2032 \u2208 G0 , we use the combination theorems to form a new\nFuchsian group [18, ch. 7]. This group is either an amalgamated free product of \u2206q\nand \u2206q\u2032 , where \u03b3i is identified with \u03b3j\u2032\u22121 if q 6= q \u2032 , or an HNN-extension of \u2206q if\nq = q \u2032 . An iteration of this procedure will yield the group \u0393q (\u03bb). For the definition\nconsider\na\nXG :=\n{q} \u00d7 D.\nq\u2208G0\n\nWe define an equivalence relation on XG such that the quotient is canonically isometric to YG (\u03bb). The equivalence relation has the following generators:\n1. (q, z) \u223c (q \u2032 , z \u2032 ) if q = q \u2032 and z \u2032 = \u03b4z for some \u03b4 \u2208 \u2206q .\n2. Let e \u2208 G\u03031 with l(e) 6= 0. Let q = s(e), so e = qi for some i \u2208 Z/3Z in the\nnotation of section 1.2. The common orthogonal of Ti+1 , Ti+2 is denoted by\nSi . Then Si is the axis of \u03b3i \u2208 \u2206q . We have \u03b9(e) = qj\u2032 for some q \u2032 \u2208 G0 , and\nif Sj\u2032 is the corresponding axis of \u03b3j\u2032 \u2208 \u2206q\u2032 , there exists a unique isometry g of\nthe hyperbolic plane such that (see figure 3)\n\u2022 g(Sj\u2032 ) = Si ,\n\n\u2022 g \u22121 \u03b3j\u2032 g = \u03b3i\u22121 ,\n\u03c4 (d)\n\n\u2022 \u03b3i\n\n\u2032\nmaps Ti+1 to g(Tj+1\n).\n\nThen we put (q, gz) \u223c (q \u2032 , z).\nThis gives YG (\u03bb) \u223c\n= XG /\u223c and\n\u0393q (\u03bb) = {\u03b3 \u2208 isom(D) | (q, z) \u223c (q, \u03b3z) for all z \u2208 D}.\nNow the crucial property is that we may choose a fundamental polygon Fq in {q}\u00d7D\nfor the action of \u2206q on its Nielsen domain. Then the union of these polygons is\na fundamental domain for the equivalence relation on XG up to a set of measure\nzero. In particular, let Fq be the set bounded by T1 , T2 , \u03c33 T1 , \u03c33 T2 and the common\n13\n\n\forthogonal of T1 , T2 and \u03c33 T1 , \u03c33 T2 as on page 7. If U \u2282 B is relatively compact,\nthere exists A > 0 such that the cylinders ZdA \u2282 YG (\u03bb) of area 2A exist for all d \u2208 G\u22171\nand all \u03bb \u2208 U. Then the subset FqA \u2282 Fq that is mapped onto the complement of\nS A\nd Zd in YG (\u03bb) has uniformly bounded diameter for \u03bb \u2208 U. (Note the cusp on\nthe left of FqA in figure 3. It belongs to Fq , so Fq is of infinite diameter.) This\nobservation allows to give a uniform estimate on the number of closed geodesics in\nYG (\u03bb).\n1.9 Lemma. Let N (\u03bb; r) denote the number of unoriented, primitive, closed geodesics in YG (\u03bb) of length at most r. Then there exist a neighbourhood U \u2282 B for\neach \u03bb0 \u2208 B and C > 0 such that N (\u03bb; r) \u2264 C * er holds for all \u03bb \u2208 U and all r > 0.\nProof. Fix U and A > 0 as above. Let \u03bb \u2208 U. If c \u2282 YG (\u03bb) is a closed geodesic\nthat is not\nS the central geodesic in one of the cylinders Zd , then its intersection with\nYG (\u03bb) \\ d ZdA is nonempty. So there exists q \u2208 G0 and a geodesic in {q} \u00d7 D that\nis mapped onto c and has nonempty intersection with the set FqA . Moreover, this\ngeodesic is the axis of some hyperbolic element in \u0393q (\u03bb) with translation length equal\nto the length of c. So N (\u03bb; r) \u2212 (3p \u2212 3 + 2n) is bounded from above by the number\nof hyperbolic isometries \u03b3 such that \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393q (\u03bb) for some q and d(FqA , \u03b3FqA ) \u2264 r\nholds. 3p \u2212 3 + 2n is the number of edges. As explained above, there is an upper\nbound D for the diameter of FqA , so\nN (\u03bb; r) \u2212 (3p \u2212 3 + 2n) \u2264 #{\u03b3 | \u03b3FqA \u2282 Br+D (FqA ) for some q}.\nIf v > 0 is a uniform lower bound for the area of FqA for all q and all \u03bb \u2208 U, this\nimplies\nN (\u03bb; r) \u2212 (3p \u2212 3 + 2n) \u2264 (2p \u2212 2 + n) * max{k \u2208 N | kv \u2264 vol Br+2D },\nwhere Br denotes a hyperbolic ball of radius r, and 2p \u2212 2 + n is the number of\nvertices. This shows\nN (\u03bb; r) \u2264 3p \u2212 3 + 2n + (2p \u2212 2 + n) * max{k | kv \u2264 4\u03c0 sinh2 (D + r/2)}\n\u2264 3p \u2212 3 + 2n + 4\u03c0(2p \u2212 2 + n)\n\u2264 3p \u2212 3 + 2n +\n\nsinh2 (D + r/2)\nv\n\n\u03c0(2p \u2212 2 + n) 2D r\ne *e .\nv\n\u0003\n\nNow we prove proposition 1.8. Let \u03bb0 = {l0 , \u03c40 ) \u2208 B. Let U be a relatively compact\nneighbourhood of \u03bb0 such that l(d) = 0 implies l0 (d) = 0 for all (l, \u03c4 ) \u2208 U. There\nare two kinds of geodesics that contribute to the quotient (7) for \u03bb \u2208 U:\n1. Those that cross a cylinder Zd \u2282 YG (\u03bb) with l0 (d) = 0. As \u03bb converges to \u03bb0 ,\ntheir length goes to infinity, so the contribution of each of these to the zeta\nfunction converges to 1.\n2. Those that do not cross such a cylinder. They are given by conjugacy classes\nof isometries in \u0393q (\u03bb) that converge to elements of \u0393q (\u03bb0 ), and each hyperbolic\nisometry in \u0393q (\u03bb0 ) arises as such a limit.\nSo if the Zeta function is replaced with a finite product over all geodesics with\nlength less than a fixed constant, the resulting quotient in (7) is continuous at \u03bb0 .\nLemma 1.9 implies a uniform estimate in U for the remainder.\n14\n\n\f2\n\nThe resolvent for geometrically finite surfaces\n\nIn this section, the resolvent of the Laplacian on functions defined on YG (\u03bb) is examined for varying \u03bb. In particular, we address its behaviour as \u03bb \u2208 B approaches the\nboundary. The main assertion, theorem 2.14, states that the resolvent is continuous\nin \u03bb if the spectral parameter does not belong to [1/4, \u221e).\nThe proof uses meromorphic Fredholm theory to compose the resolvent from those\nof auxiliary surfaces, where the latter are rather easy to describe. So the first\nsubsection is concerned with the auxiliary surfaces, and its results are combined in\nthe second subsection to examine general surfaces of finite geometry.\nThis technique of applying meromorphic Fredholm theory has often been applied to\nprove the existence of a continuation of the resolvent across the essential spectrum\nof the Laplacian. More precisely, the map s 7\u2192 (\u2206 \u2212 s(1 \u2212 s))\u22121 , defined for all\ns \u2208 C such that s(1 \u2212 s) belongs to the resolvent set and Re(s) > 1/2, has a\nmeromorphic continuation to C as a family in, say, B(L2c , H2loc ). We will make use\nof the continuation in section 3.1. Yet the continuity results of this section only\naddress the physical domain Re(s) > 1/2, and similar results fail to hold for the\ncontinued resolvent even in the case of elementary surfaces. We refer to Guillop\u00e9's\ntext [7] for further details on the continuation, our description of the resolvent\nclosely follows his presentation.\n\n2.1\n\nAuxiliary surfaces\n\nWe provide all statements on the resolvent operators for model surfaces that are\nneeded to deduce similar results for a geometrically finite surface. The models\nare either compact or quotients of the hyperbolic plane by an elementary group of\nisometries. In the compact case, Hilbert-Schmidt and trace class properties of the\nresolvent are immediate, and so is its continuity with respect to an arbitrary family\nof Riemannian metrics. We will give the arguments below. In the case of elementary\nquotients of the hyperbolic plane, continuous dependency on the metric refers to\nthe identification of a pair of cusps with the complement of a closed geodesic in a\nhyperbolic cylinder of arbitrary diameter, as it is induced by the identity map of R2\nvia definition 1.2. Note that this identification preserves the Riemannian volume,\nso it gives an isometry of L2 -spaces. Continuity of the resolvent as a bounded map\ninto (local) Sobolev spaces is then obtained from inspection of its integral kernel\n(proposition 2.6). The major part of this section is aimed at a trace class property\nfor a truncated resolvent and, in particular, uniform boundedness of its trace norm\nfor cylinders of small diameter (proposition 2.12).\n2.1.1\n\nCompact surfaces\n\nLet (Y, g) be a compact Riemannian manifold of dimension 2. The spectrum of\nthe Laplacian \u2206 is purely discrete, and there exists a complete set of orthonormal\neigenfunctions for \u2206 in L2 (Y, volg ). Weyl's asymptotic law states that the spectral\ncounting function N (\u03bb), i.e. the number of eigenvalues below \u03bb according to their\nmultiplicities, is asymptotic to \u03bb vol(Y )/4\u03c0 as \u03bb increases. This implies that the\nresolvent (\u2206 + 1)\u22121 is of Hilbert-Schmidt class, and (\u2206 + 1)\u22122 is of trace class.\nWe use the notion of trace class mappings between different Hilbert spaces to reformulate this observation. A bounded linear map T : E \u2192 F of separable Hilbert\nspaces is of trace class if the supremum over all sums\n\u221e\nX\ni=1\n\n|hT ei , fi i|\n15\n\n\fis finite, where (ei )i\u2208N runs through the complete orthonormal systems of E, and\n(fi ) through those of F . The supremum is denoted by kT k1 or kT kB1 (E,F ) . The\nvector space B1 (E, F ) of trace class operators is complete with respect to this norm.\nIf T \u2208 B1 (E, E), the trace of T is defined by the series\nX\nhT ei , ei i,\ntr T :=\ni\n\nwhich is independent of the chosen orthonormal system.\nThere is a related concept of Hilbert-Schmidt operators, we refer to H\u00f6rmander [11,\npp. 185-193] for the particulars.\nIn the present situation, the Hilbert spaces we are interested in are Sobolev spaces\nof functions on Y . As a vector subspace of L2 (Y, volg ), for any k \u2265 0, the Sobolev\nspace Hk (Y, g) is the image of (\u2206 + 1)\u2212k/2 . A Hilbert space structure is defined by\nthe requirement that\n(\u2206 + 1)\u2212k/2 : L2 (Y, volg ) \u2212\u2192 Hk (Y, g)\nbe isometric. Then (\u2206 + 1)\u22122 , if considered as a bounded operator on L2 (Y, volg ),\nis equal to the composition of bounded maps\n(\u2206+1)\u22122\n\n\u03b9\n\nL2 (Y, volg ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 H4 (Y, g) \u2212\u2192 L2 (Y, volg ).\nSince the first of these is isometric, trace class property for the square of the resolvent\non L2 (Y, volg ) means that the inclusion \u03b9 is of trace class and\nk\u03b9kB1 (H4 ,L2 ) = (\u2206 + 1)\u22122\n\nB1 (L2 ,L2 )\n\n.\n\nThe following lemma is an immediate consequence.\n2.1 Lemma. Let A(t) : L2 (Y, volg ) \u2192 H4 (Y, g) be a continuous family of bounded\nlinear mappings. Then \u03b9 \u25e6 A(t) \u2208 B1 (L2 (Y, volg ), L2 (Y, volg )) also depends continuously on t.\nProof. We have\n\u0001\n\u03b9 \u25e6 A(t) \u2212 A(t0 )\n\nB1 (L2 ,L2 )\n\n\u2264 k\u03b9kB1 (H4 ,L2 ) * kA(t) \u2212 A(t0 )k .\n\u0003\n\n2.2 Corollary. Let \u2206h denote the Laplacian on functions that is associated with a\nRiemannian metric h on Y . Then\n\u0001\nh 7\u2212\u2192 tr (\u2206h \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 \u2212 (\u2206h \u2212 \u03bb0 )\u22121\nis continuous on the open set of metrics where it is defined.\n\nProof. Let g be a Riemannian metric on Y . A linear isometry \u03b4h : L2 (Y, volg ) \u2192\nL2 (Y, volh ) is defined by multiplication of functions with the square root of an\nappropriate Radon-Nikodym derivative. The above trace is equal to the trace of\nthe following operator on L2 (Y, volg ):\n\u0001\n\u03b4h\u22121 \u25e6 (\u2206h \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 \u2212 (\u2206h \u2212 \u03bb0 )\u22121 \u25e6 \u03b4h\n= (\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 ) * \u03b4h\u22121 \u25e6 (\u2206h \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 (\u2206h \u2212 \u03bb0 )\u22121 \u25e6 \u03b4h .\n\nThe coefficients of the differential operator (\u2206h \u2212 \u03bb)(\u2206h \u2212 \u03bb0 ) depend continuously\non h, so it defines a continuous family of bounded maps H4 (Y, g) \u2192 L2 (Y, volg ).\nTherefore, the inverse maps also depend continuously on h, and the previous lemma\nis applicable.\n\u0003\n16\n\n\f2.1.2\n\nElementary surfaces\n\nAn elementary hyperbolic surface is a quotient Z = \u0393\\D of the hyperbolic plane,\nwhere the group \u0393 of isometries has a cyclic subgroup of finite index. We only\nconsider elementary groups that are cyclic, generated by a hyperbolic or a parabolic\nisometry of X.\nOur aim is to compare the resolvent of the Laplacians for different surfaces. Define\nX := {(x, a) \u2208 R2 | a 6= 0},\nand\nZ := h\u03b3i\\X,\n\nwhere \u03b3 : (x, a) 7\u2212\u2192 (x + 1, a).\n\nRecall that, for each l \u2265 0, the split plane X may be identified with a subset of the\nmodel Xl for the hyperbolic plane (definition 1.2). If we fix the Euclidean volume\non X, this gives rise to an isometry of L2 -spaces. So there is a corresponding family\nof self-adjoint Laplacians \u2206l acting on L2 (X) and on L2 (Z). In each case, the\nspectrum of \u2206l is [1/4, \u221e). We may thus consider the resolvent operators as an\nanalytic family of bounded operators\n\u0001\u22121\ns 7\u2212\u2192 \u2206l \u2212 s(1 \u2212 s)\n, Re(s) > 1/2,\nand the half-plane {s \u2208 C | Re(s) > 1/2} is a maximal domain where it is defined.\nWe shall prove the following statement.\n2.3 Proposition.\n\n1. Let \u03c8 be a smooth function of compact support on Z. Then\n\u0001\u22121\ns 7\u2212\u2192 \u03c8 \u2206l \u2212 s(1 \u2212 s)\n\ndepends continuously on l \u2208 [0, \u221e) in the sense of locally uniform convergence\nof analytic families of bounded linear maps L2 (Z) \u2192 H2 (Z).

In the second part, the support of \u03c8 is not necessarily\ncompact. We note that the methods of section 2.1.1 apply to deduce the second\npart from the first if the degenerate case l = 0 is excluded. The proof for small\nvalues of l is given in the forthcoming subsection.\n17\n\n\f2.1.3\n\nProof of proposition 2.3\n\n\u0001\u22121\nA continuity statement. Let Ksl denote the Schwartz kernel of \u2206l \u2212s(1\u2212s)\n,\nacting on L2 (Z). It is a smooth function on the complement of the diagonal in Z \u00d7Z.\nThe following is a well-known property of Ksl .\n2.5 Lemma.

The analogous statement holds for an arbitrary hyperbolic surface if Re(s) >\n1/2 holds and if the critical exponent of a uniformising group is less that Re(s). We\nrefer to Elstrodt [5] for a proof. In the present situation, the critical exponent is\n1/2 if l = 0, and 0 otherwise.\n\u0003\nNow we use lemma 2.5 to deduce the first statement of proposition 2.3.\n2.6 Proposition. Let \u03c8 be a smooth function on Z of compact support.

First of all, we observe that ks \u25e6 \u03c3l converges to ks \u25e6 \u03c3l0 as l \u2192 l0 , uniformly\non every compact subset of X \u00d7 X. This even holds on the diagonal in the sense\nthat the difference ks \u25e6 \u03c3l \u2212 ks \u25e6 \u03c3l0 has a continuous extension, which converges\nlocally uniformly to 0. Lemma 2.7 below shows that the same holds true for the\nkernel Ksl on the quotient.\nNow let B denote a compact neighbourhood of supp \u03c8.

The kernel Ksl , considered as a smooth function on the complement\nof the diagonal in Z \u00d7 Z, depends continuously on (s, l) \u2208 {s \u2208 C | Re(s) > 1/2} \u00d7\n[0, \u221e).\n19\n\n\fP\nProof. It is easy to see that a finite sum (z1 , z2 ) 7\u2192 |n|\u2264N ks (\u03c3l (z1 , \u03b3 n z2 )) depends\ncontinuously on s and l. So we only need to give a bound for the derivatives of the\nremainder in the series. We will show below\ndn\nks (t) = (4 + t)\u2212s\u2212n fn (s, t)\ndtn\n\n(9)\n\nwith a function fn that is bounded on any compact subset of {s \u2208 C | Re(s) >\n1/2} \u00d7 (0, \u221e]. Therefore it is sufficient to replace ks (t) with (4 + t)\u2212s and to give\na bound in the C0 -topology.

Then the statement follows from the continuity\nof l 7\u2192 \u03c3l .\n\u0003\nTrace class estimates. We prove the second part of proposition 2.3. Essentially\nthe proof is split into two parts: Trace class property is immediate if l > 0, for in\nthis case \u03c8 corresponds to a compactly supported function on Xl . The first point\nis to show that the operator under consideration is of trace class for l = 0. Then\nproposition 2.12 states that the trace norm is uniformly bounded in l if the support\nof \u03c8 is small, which reduces the proof to the case where \u03c8 is compactly supported,\ni.e. part 1 of proposition 2.3 applies.\nAs the elementary cylinder Z is a quotient of X = {(x, a) \u2208 R2 | a 6= 0}, the support\ncondition on \u03c7 implies that there is a gap between the support and the deleted closed\ncurve in Z. The support of \u03c8 in contrast may include a neighbourhood of this curve,\nso \u03c8 corresponds to a function of unbounded support on the disjoint union Z0 of\ntwo cusps. Thus our first issue is to prove that in this situation\n\u0010\n\u0001\u22121\n\u0001\u22121 \u0011\n\u03c8 \u22060 \u2212 s(1 \u2212 s)\n\u03c7\n\u2212 \u22060 \u2212 s0 (1 \u2212 s0 )\n\nis of trace class. Let us explain how the propositions below are applied to prove\nthis fact. We may assume that \u03c8 and \u03c7 are supported in the component Z + . In\nthis paragraph we will use Z A synonymously with Z [\u2212A,A] for numbers A > 0. The\nfirst resolvent formula implies that the operator is the strong limit of\n\u0001\u22121 \u0011\n\u0001\u22121\n\u0001 \u0010\n\u03baA \u22060 \u2212 s0 (1 \u2212 s0 )\ns(1 \u2212 s) \u2212 s0 (1 \u2212 s0 ) \u03c8 \u22060 \u2212 s(1 \u2212 s)\n\u03c7\n\nas A \u2192 0, where \u03baA denotes the characteristic function of Z + \\ Z A . Lemma\n2.10 below states that these operators are indeed of trace class if A > 0. Then\nproposition 2.11 implies that, if A converges to 0, the sequence of operators is a\nCauchy sequence in the trace class topology. The limit of this sequence coincides\nwith the strong limit, so the latter is of trace class.\nThe crucial observation in this argument will be a growth estimate for the kernel\nthat implies proposition 2.11 and convergence in the trace class topology. Essentially\n21\n\n\fthe same estimate will be used again, in proposition 2.12, to examine the trace norm\nof\n\u0010\n\u0001\u22121 \u0011\n\u0001\u22121 \u0011\n\u03c7\n\u03c8 \u2206l \u2212 s(1 \u2212 s)\n\u2212 \u2206l \u2212 s0 (1 \u2212 s0 )\nlocally uniformly in l. There it proves that the norm\n\u0010\n\u0001\u22121\n\u0001\u22121 \u0011\n\u03c7\n\u2212 \u2206l \u2212 s0 (1 \u2212 s0 )\n\u03c8\u01eb \u2206l \u2212 s(1 \u2212 s)\n\n1\n\nbecomes uniformly small as \u01eb \u2192 0, where \u03c8\u01eb is the characteristic function of Z \u01eb .\nThen we may apply the first part of proposition 2.3 to conclude the proof of the\nsecond.\nWe proceed with the technical assertions that contribute to the proof. They rely\non Hilbert-Schmidt properties for \u2206l , which are proved using the description of the\nresolvent kernel in lemma 2.5. As it turns out, the logarithmic singularity of the\nresolvent kernel is irrelevant. The decisive property is its asymptotic\n\u0001\nks (t) = O t\u2212 Re(s) , t \u2192 \u221e,\n\nand therefore the following lemma will be useful. It is purely technical but provides\na convenient formula for our estimates.\n\n2.9 Lemma. Let l \u2265 0 and r > 1/2.

To remove the ambiguity in this statement, we note that Y is\ndefined in such a way that each orientation e \u2208 G\u0303\u22171 of d \u2208 G\u22171 gives rise to such an\nembedding. If d is a proper edge, replacing e with \u03b9(e) corresponds to composition\nof that embedding with (x, a) 7\u2192 (\u2212x, \u2212a), so there is a canonical inclusion of Zd\nfor each d \u2208 G\u22171 into the cylinder\n(\n\u0001\n{e} \u00d7 h\u03b3i\\Xl0 (d) \u222a {\u03b9(e)} \u00d7 h\u03b3i\\Xl0 (d) / \u223c if d \u2208 G1 ,\nZ\u0304d :=\n{d} \u00d7 h\u03b3i\\Xl0 (d)\nif d \u2208 G\u22171 \\ G1 ,\nwhere the equivalence relation is generated by (e, (x, a)) \u223c (\u03b9(e), (\u2212x, \u2212a)).

For this\npurpose, we choose a collection of smooth functions\n\u03c6d : Y \u2212\u2192 [0, 1] for d \u2208 G\u22171 ,\n\nsupp \u03c6d \u2282 Zd ,\n\nthat satisfy for some \u01eb > 0\nA(l0 (d))*\u01eb\n\n\u03c6d (z) = 1 if d \u2208 G1 and z \u2208 Zd\n\u03c6d (z) = 1 if d \u2208\n\nG\u22171\n\n\\ G1 and z \u2208\n\nZd+\n\n,\nA(l0 (d))*\u01eb\n\n\u222a Zd\n\n.\n\nLet the smooth functions \u03c8d , d \u2208 G\u22171 , fulfil the same support conditions and in\naddition \u03c8d * \u03c6d = \u03c6d . If Re(s) > 1/2, the resolvent operators\nRd (s) := (\u2206Z\u0304d \u2212 s(1 \u2212 s))\u22121\nexist. Then \u03c8d Rd (s)\u03c6d is considered to be acting on L2 (Y ), where functions that\nare supported in Zd are identified with functions on Z\u0304d via the embeddings just\ndescribed.\nThis construction for Y = YG (\u03bb0 ) is carried over to YG (\u03bb) for all \u03bb near \u03bb0 . There\nexists a neighbourhood U of \u03bb0 such that, with respect to a trivialisation of E \u2192 B\n28\n\n\fover U as constructed in section 1, the cut-off functions can be chosen simultaneously\nfor all \u03bb \u2208 U. The trivialising map of E|U is denoted by\n\u03a8\u03bb : Y = YG (\u03bb0 ) \u2212\u2192 YG (\u03bb).\nIt maps the complement of all closed geodesics in the cylinders Zd diffeomorphically onto its image, and there is an induced linear homeomorphism L2 (Y, vol) \u2192\nL2 (YG (\u03bb), vol). The pull-back of an operator to L2 (Y, vol) will be labelled with a\nsubscript \u03bb.\n2.14 Theorem.\n1. Let \u03c8 be a smooth function on YG (\u03bb0 ), compactly supported\nin the complement of the closed geodesics in the Zd .

One concludes from part 1 of this theorem that the same result\n\u2032\n\u2032\nholds if the resolvent is considered as a map Hkc (Y \u2032 ) \u2192 Hk+2\nloc (Y ), where Y is the\ncomplement of the distinguished closed geodesics. The proof is analogous to that\nof proposition 2.6.\nAppearance of the strong operator topology in theorem 2.14 is a consequence of\nhow the trivialisation \u03a8\u03bb was chosen. If Zd (\u03bb) and Z\u0304d (\u03bb) are the cylinders defined\nfor YG (\u03bb) in analogy with Zd , Z\u0304d \u2282 YG (\u03bb0 ), there are canonical diffeomorphisms\n\u03a8\u0304d,\u03bb : Z\u0304d \u2212\u2192 Z\u0304d (\u03bb)\n\n(20)\n\ninduced by the identity of R2 . It does not coincide with the map induced by the\ntrivialisation \u03a8\u03bb . Instead, the composition\n\u03a8\u03bb\nZ\u0304d\u01eb \u223c\n= Zd\u01eb \u2212\u2212\u2192 Zd\u01eb (\u03bb) \u223c\n= Z\u0304d\u01eb (\u03bb)\n\nis given by\n(x, a) 7\u2212\u2192\n\n(\n\n(x + (\u03c40 (d) \u2212 \u03c4 (d))/2, a)\n(x \u2212 (\u03c40 (d) \u2212 \u03c4 (d))/2, a)\n\nif a < 0,\nif a > 0.\n\nIf we denote by \u03a8\u03bb the obvious extension of this map to Z\u0304d \u2192 Z\u0304d (\u03bb), the automorphism of L2 (Z\u0304d ) induced by \u03a8\u0304\u22121\nd,\u03bb \u25e6 \u03a8\u03bb depends continuously on \u03bb in the strong\noperator topology, but not necessarily in the norm topology. It is the identity mapping if we restrict \u03bb to a subset of B where all twist-parameters are constant. The\nproof of 2.14 will show that under this restriction strong continuity may be replaced\nwith norm continuity.\n\n29\n\n\fProof of the theorem, part 1. The approach is analogous to that described\nby Guillop\u00e9 [7], where the resolvent is continued analytically across the essential\nspectrum of \u2206 by using meromorphic Fredholm theory. See the book of Reed and\nSimon [21] for a statement of the Fredholm theorem.\nLet P denote the interior of\n\u0013\n\u0012 [\n[\nA(l(d))*\u01eb/2\nZd+ .\nY \\\nZd\n\u222a\nd\u2208G\u2217\n1\n\nd\u2208G\n/ 1\n\nThe family \u03c6d of functions on Y is supplemented with an additional function \u03c60 to\nform a partition of unity. The support of \u03c60 is contained in P , and there exists a\nsmooth function \u03c80 of support in P with \u03c80 * \u03c60 = \u03c60 .\nJust as the cylindrical subsets Zd are embedded into Z\u0304d , we embed P isometrically\ninto an auxiliary surface P\u0304 . This surface is required to be compact. Composition\nof this map with \u03a8\u22121\n\u03bb gives an inclusion of the corresponding subset of YG (\u03bb) into\nP\u0304 , and we may assume that there is a continuous family g\u03bb of Riemannian metrics\ngiven on P\u0304 such that this inclusion is isometric in each case.\nSuppressing its dependence on \u03bb in our notation, we consider the resolvent operators\n\u0001\u22121\nR0 (s) := (\u2206P\u0304 + t)\u22121 and Rd (s) := \u2206Z\u0304d \u2212 s(1 \u2212 s)\n.\n\nThe parameter t will be chosen suitably below. In the formulae to come, the summation index j will run through G\u22171 and {0}. On L2 (YG (\u03bb)) there is the equation\nof operators\nX\n\u03c8j Rj (s)\u03c6j = (1 + Q(s)),\n(21)\n(\u2206 \u2212 s(1 \u2212 s)) \u25e6\nj\n\nwith a compact operator Q(s) given by\nQ(s) = (\u2212t \u2212 s(1 \u2212 s))\u03c80 (\u2206P\u0304 + t)\u22121 \u03c60 +\n\nX\n\n[\u2206, \u03c8j ]Rj (s)\u03c6j .\n\nj\n\nIf 1 + Q(s) is invertible and the resolvent operators exist, by (21) we have\n\u0011\n\u0010X\n\u03c8j Rj (s)\u03c6j \u25e6 (1 + Q(s))\u22121 = (\u2206 \u2212 s(1 \u2212 s))\u22121 .\nj\n\nSo continuity of the resolvent in \u03bb is reduced to that of the operators on the left-hand\nside. And invertibility of 1 + Q(s) indeed holds: If t = \u2212s(1 \u2212 s), the norm of Q(s)\nbecomes arbitrarily small as the real part of s increases. Thus there exists t such\nthat 1 + Q(s) is invertible for some s. We fix such a t, and analytic Fredholm theory\nimplies that the map s 7\u2192 (1 + Q(s))\u22121 is meromorphic on {s \u2208 C | Re(s) > 1/2}.\nWe want to see that the pull-back Q(s)\u03bb to L2 (Y ) depends continuously on \u03bb in\nthe norm topology of B(L2 (Y )), and so do the \u03c8j Rj (s)\u03bb \u03c6j in the strong topology\nof B(L2 (Y ), H2loc (Y )).\nIn both cases, this is obvious for the contribution of the compact part P\u0304 , as these\noperators are associated with the Laplacian for a continuous family of metrics on\na compact surface. So let us consider a contribution [\u2206\u03bb , \u03c8d ]Rd (s)\u03bb \u03c6d to Q(s)\u03bb for\nsome d \u2208 G\u22171 . In terms of the canonical map \u03a8\u0304d,\u03bb between elementary cylinders, cf.\n(20), this factorises into\n\u03a8\u2217\u03bb \u25e6 [\u2206Z\u0304d (\u03bb) , \u03c8d ] \u25e6 (\u2206Z\u0304d (\u03bb) \u2212 s(1 \u2212 s))\u22121 \u25e6 \u03a8\u22121\u2217\n\u25e6 \u03c6d\n\u03bb\n\n= [\u2206\u03bb , \u03c8d ] \u25e6 \u03a8\u2217\u03bb \u25e6 (\u2206Z\u0304d (\u03bb) \u2212 s(1 \u2212 s))\u22121 \u25e6 \u03a8\u22121\u2217\n\u25e6 \u03c6d\n\u03bb\n\n\u2217\n\u22121 \u22121\u2217\n= [\u2206\u03bb , \u03c8d ] \u25e6 \u03a8\u2217\u03bb \u03a8\u0304\u22121\u2217\n\u03a8\u0304d,\u03bb \u25e6 \u03a8\u0304\u2217d,\u03bb \u03a8\u22121\u2217\n\u25e6 \u03c6d .\nd,\u03bb \u25e6 \u03a8\u0304d,\u03bb (\u2206Z\u0304d (\u03bb) \u2212 s(1 \u2212 s))\n\u03bb\n\n30\n\n\fIn proposition 2.6 we proved that \u03c7\u03a8\u0304\u2217d,\u03bb (\u2206Z\u0304d (\u03bb) \u2212 s(1 \u2212 s))\u22121 \u03a8\u0304\u22121\u2217\nd,\u03bb is a continuous\nfamily of compact linear maps L2 (Z\u0304d ) \u2192 H1 (Z\u0304d ) if \u03c7 is compactly supported off\nthe closed geodesic. The support of the the differential operator on the left also\nsatisfies this condition. This and the strong continuity of \u03a8\u0304\u2217d,\u03bb \u25e6 \u03a8\u22121\u2217\nproves norm\n\u03bb\ncontinuity of the composition and that of Q(s)\u03bb .\nThe remaining operators Rj (s)\u03bb are treated in the same manner, but we must stick\nto strong continuity since they are not composed with a compact operator.\nProof of the theorem, part 2.

In the first subsection, we\ndefine functions that meet this criterion to some extend, as well as an appropriate\nnotion of approximate scattering matrices. The Maass-Selberg relation and the\nfunctional equation generalise to this setting, at least if the surface is of finite area.\nIn the second subsection, we therefore restrict to the finite area case and examine\nhow the introduced structure behaves during degeneration.\n3.1.1\n\nDefinitions and fundamental properties\n\nThis part is not concerned with families of degenerating surfaces, but with a fixed\nsurface Y = YG (\u03bb). We make use of the meromorphic continuation of the resolvent\n(\u2206 \u2212 s(1 \u2212 s))\u22121 in s from Re(s) > 1/2 to the complex plane [7]. We also use the\nconventions from section 1 that associate with each oriented edge j \u2208 G\u0303\u22171 coordinates\nfor an embedded cylinder Zj \u2282 Y .\nThe original definition of Eisenstein series for hyperbolic surfaces of finite area is\nbased on certain eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on elementary cusps. We give a\ndefinition, in terms of the hypergeometric function, that serves the same purpose\nfor half-cylinders of arbitrary circumference.\n3.1 Definition. For each l \u2265 0 and s \u2208 C \\ (\u22121/2 \u2212 N0 ) put\n(\n\u2212s\n|a| F (s/2, 1/2 + s/2; 1/2 + s; \u2212l2 /a2 ) if a < 0,\nh(l, s) : R \u2212\u2192 C, a 7\u2212\u2192\n0\notherwise.\n32\n\n\f\u03c7\n\na\n\n\u2212\u01eb 0\n\nZl\u2212\n\nZl+\n\nFigure 4: The cut-off function \u03c7.\nWe identify h(l, s) in the obvious manner with a rotationally-symmetric function\non the elementary cylinder Zl = h\u03b3i\\Xl . The Laplacian on Zl is\n\u2206Zl = \u2212(l2 + a2 )\u22121 \u2202x2 \u2212 (l2 + a2 )\u2202a2 \u2212 2a\u2202a .\nOne checks, for example by expanding the hypergeometric function into a power\nseries, that the restriction of h(l, s) to the open half-cylinder Zl\u2212 belongs to the\nkernel of \u2206Zl \u2212 s(1 \u2212 s). The choice of these functions is motivated by the following\nproperties:\n\u2022 On Zl\u2212 they converge smoothly to h(0, s) as l \u2192 0, and this is precisely the\nfunction used to define Eisenstein series associated with a cusp.\n\u2022 For generic s, the functions h(l, s) and h(l, 1 \u2212 s) are linearly independent.\n\u2022 The asymptotic of h(l, s) as a \u2192 \u2212\u221e is that of h(0, s) for all l.\nAs an aside, note that h(l, s) depends quite trivially on l in the upper half-plane\nmodel: By means of the isometries introduced in section 1, we obtain the function\ns\n\nz 7\u2212\u2192 l\u2212s |tan(arg z)| F (s/2, 1/2 + s/2; 1/2 + s; \u2212(tan(arg z))2 ).\nBeing an eigenfunction of a linear ordinary differential equation, there is of course a\ncontinuation of h(l, s)|Z \u2212 to Zl as an eigenfunction if l > 0, and this continuation\nl\nwill be used below. But we want to stress out that h(l, s) has a jump discontinuity\nat a = 0 by definition.\nThe asymptotic of h(l, s) as a \u2192 \u2212\u221e admit to define approximate Eisenstein\nfunctions by summation over elements of a uniformising group, just as in the classical\ndefinition of Eisenstein series. We analysed the resolvent of the Laplacian in section\n2, so it is preferable to use the resolvent instead. Fix a cut-off function \u03c7 : Zl \u2192 [0, 1]\nthat is smooth, rotationally symmetric, and supported in a small neighbourhood of\n(\u2212\u221e,\u2212\u01eb)\nZl+ , such that the support of 1 \u2212 \u03c7 is contained in Zl\nfor some \u01eb > 0. Then\n[\u2206Zl , \u03c7] is a differential operator, compactly supported in Zl\u2212 , and [\u2206Zl , \u03c7] h(l, s) is\na smooth function of compact support in Zl\u2212 . Recall from section 1 how an oriented\nA(l(j))\nwith a collar in Y .\nedge j \u2208 G\u0303\u22171 of a graph gives rise to an identification of Zl(j)\nWe require the support of \u03c7 h(l(j), s) to belong to this subset, so that \u03c7 h(l(j), s)\nand [\u2206Zl(j) , \u03c7] h(l(j), s) both can be considered as functions on Y .\n3.2 Definition. If Re(s) > 1, the approximate Eisenstein function of j \u2208 G\u0303\u22171 is the\nfunction on Y given by\n\u0001\nEj (s) := (\u2206 \u2212 s(1 \u2212 s))\u22121 [\u2206Zl(j) , \u03c7]h(l(j), s) + \u03c7h(l(j), s).\n33\n\n\fFrom the definition we immediately see that Ej (s) specialises to the Eisenstein\nseries if l(j) = 0. It is an eigenfunction of the Laplacian on the subset of Y where\nit is smooth, that is, on the complement of a single closed geodesic.\nThe aforementioned continuation of the resolvent provides a meromorphic continuation of Ej (s) in s to the complex plane. A property that these functions inherit\nfrom the classical Eisenstein series is that they satisfy some kind of Maass-Selberg\nrelation, which involves the notion of scattering matrices. We need a replacement\nfor the latter in the present situation.\nFor each function f \u2208 L1loc (Y ) and each j \u2208 G\u0303\u22171 , the canonical coordinates of the\nhalf-cylinder Zj\u2212 give rise to fibrewise Fourier coefficients of f by\nFjn f (a)\n\n:=\n\nZ\n\n1\n\nf (x, a) exp(2\u03c0inx)dx,\n\n0\n\nl(j)\n\u2212 2 sinh(l(j)/2)\n< a < 0.\n\nIn particular, if s \u2212 1/2 \u2208\n/ Z and if the restriction of f to Zj\u2212 is annihilated by\n0\n\u2206 \u2212 s(1 \u2212 s), then Fj f is a linear combination of h(l(j), s) and h(l(j), 1 \u2212 s).\nThis observation is used to define a pair of matrices that are associated with a\ndistinguished subset S of the edges:\n3.3 Definition. Let S \u2282 G\u22171 be a set that contains all edges j with l(j) = 0 and\nall phantom edges. Let S\u0303 \u2282 G\u0303\u22171 be the set of oriented representatives of edges in S.\nThen there are two analytic families C = (Cij )i,j\u2208S\u0303 and D = (Dij )i,j\u2208S\u0303 of matrices\ndefined by the equation\nFj0 Ei (s) = Dij (s) h(l, s) + Cij (s) h(l, 1 \u2212 s)\n\n(24)\n\nif Re(s) > 1 and s \u2212 1/2 \u2208\n/ N. The matrix C(s) is called an approximate scattering\nmatrix.\nAgain we see that the approximate scattering matrix specialises to the scattering\nmatrix if \u03bb satisfies l(d) = 0 for all d \u2208 S. It has a meromorphic continuation in s\nto all of C. The choice of S should be imagined as the choice of a certain stratum in\nthe boundary of the space B of hyperbolic surfaces constructed from a given graph.\nOur objective in the next subsection will be to approximate the Eisenstein series\nand the scattering matrix for a surface YG (\u03bb\u2032 ), where \u03bb\u2032 = (l\u2032 , \u03c4 \u2032 ) satisfies l\u2032 (j) = 0\nif and only if j \u2208 S.\nSome fundamental properties of the approximate scattering matrices are deduced in\nlemma 3.4 and 3.5 below, before the Maass-Selberg relation will be given in theorem\n3.7. Then the functional equations for the approximate Eisenstein functions and\nscattering matrices will be discussed as consequences of the Maass-Selberg-relation.\nRecall that h(l, s) has simple poles in s if l 6= 0. To clarify the behaviour of C at\nthese points, we give an explicit formula in terms of the constant modes Fj0 Ei (s).\n3.4 Lemma. Let s be a regular point of the approximate Eisenstein function Ei .\nThen\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012 0\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nl(j)2 + a2 \u2202a h(l(j), 1 \u2212 s) \u2212h(l(j), 1 \u2212 s)\nFj Ei (s)\nDij (s)\n.\n=\n\u2212\u2202a h(l(j), s)\nh(l(j), s)\n\u2202a Fj0 Ei (s)\nCij (s)\n1 \u2212 2s\nThis formula indicates that there might be poles of the Dij in {s \u2208 C | Re(s) > 1},\nwhile the approximate scattering matrix in this domain is holomorphic.\nProof. As h(l(j), s) and h(l(j), 1\u2212s) are linearly independent solutions of a secondorder ordinary differential equation, the coefficients Dij (s) and Cij (s) in (24) are\n34\n\n\fdetermined by Fj0 Ei (s) and \u2202a Fj0 Ei (s) for an arbitrary point a < 0. The formula\nthen follows from solving the system\n\u0012 0\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\nFj Ei (s)\nh(l(j), s)\nh(l(j), 1 \u2212 s)\nDij (s)\n=\n\u2202a Fj0 Ei (s)\n\u2202a h(l(j), s) \u2202a h(l(j), 1 \u2212 s)\nCij (s)\nby inversion of the Wronskian matrix. The determinant \u03c9 of the Wronskian solves\n\u0001\n\u2202a (l2 + a2 ) \u03c9(a) = 0.\n\nIt can be evaluated at a = 0 by equation (25) below, which gives \u03c9(0) = (1\u22122s)l\u22122 .\nSo we obtain\n1 \u2212 2s\nl2 \u03c9(0)\n= 2\n.\n\u03c9(a) = 2\nl + a2\nl + a2\n\u0003\nIf C is the scattering matrix of a finite-area surface, one knows that D is the identity\nmatrix. This does not hold in the more general situation here, but the next lemma\nshows that D can in fact be calculated from C. The reason for this dependency is\nthat the approximate Eisenstein functions are smooth eigenfunctions up to a single\ndiscontinuity that is known explicitly. So one simply has to compare the functions\nDij (s) h(l(j), s) + Cij (s) h(l(j), 1 \u2212 s), which are associated with Zj\u2212 , with those for\n\u2212\nZ\u03b9(j)\n= Zj+ , to see if they match up correctly.\n3.5 Lemma. For all s \u2208 C let \u03bbs and \u03a3(s) denote the matrices with the following\nentries:\n(\nl(j)s if i = j and l(j) 6= 0,\ns\n(\u03bb )ij =\n0\notherwise;\n\uf8f1\n\u22121\n\uf8f4\nif i = j,\n\uf8f2cos(\u03c0s)\n\u0001\n\u03a3(s) ij = 1\nif i \u2208 G\u03031 and j = \u03b9(i),\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0\notherwise.\nThen C and D satisfy\n\nD(s) = 1 + (2s \u2212 1)\n\n4\u2212s \u0393(s)2\nC(s) * \u03a3(s) * \u03bb2s\u22121 .\n\u0393(1/2 + s)2\n\nProof. We already mentioned that this formula is related with the continuation of\nh(l, s) as a smooth eigenfunction from Zl\u2212 to Zl . If l > 0 and a < 0, we have\n\u0393(1/2)\u0393(1/2 + s)\nF (s/2, 1/2 \u2212 s/2; 1/2; \u2212a2/l2 )\n\u0393(1/2 + s/2)2\n\u0393(\u22121/2)\u0393(1/2 + s)\naF (1/2 + s/2, 1 \u2212 s/2; 3/2; \u2212a2/l2 ), (25)\n\u2212 l\u2212(1+s)\n\u0393(s/2)2\n\nh(l, s)(a) = l\u2212s\n\nand each summand on the right-hand side is an eigenfunction on the real line.\nThe proof of this equation consists of a functional equation for the hypergeometric\nfunction, cf. [6, p. 17, eq. (17)]. Now if a is positive and the same functional\nequation is applied to either summand in (25) again, we see that it is equal to\n\u0015\n\u0014\n4s \u0393(1/2 + s)2\nh(l,\n1\n\u2212\ns)\n(\u2212a).\n(26)\ncos(\u03c0s)\u22121 h(l, s) + l1\u22122s\n(2s \u2212 1)\u0393(s)2\n\n35\n\n\fFor completeness, let us carry out an intermediate step in the derivation of this\nformula: The functional equation gives\n\u03c0\u0393(1/2 + s)\u0393(1/2 \u2212 s)\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1\n+\n2\n2\n2\n\u0393(1/2 + s/2) \u0393(1/2 \u2212 s/2)\n\u0393(s/2) \u0393(1 \u2212 s/2)2\n\n\u0013\n\n* a\u2212s F (s/2, 1/2 + s/2; 1/2 + s, \u2212l2 /a2 )\n+ 2\u03c0l1\u22122s\n\n\u0393(1/2 + s)\u0393(\u22121/2 + s) \u2212(1\u2212s)\na\nF (1/2 \u2212 s/2, 1 \u2212 s/2; 3/2 \u2212 s; \u2212l2 /a2 ).\n\u0393(1/2 + s/2)2 \u0393(s/2)2\n\nThen (26) follows from cos(\u03c0z)\u0393(1/2 + z)\u0393(1/2 \u2212 z) = \u03c0 and from Legendre's\nduplication formula for the Gamma function.\nWith this at hand, we determine Dij (s) if j is a phantom edge and l(j) 6= 0. For\neach i \u2208 S\u0303,\nEi (s) \u2212 \u03b4ij \u03c7 h(l(i), s)\nis an eigenfunction of \u2206 in a neighbourhood of the closed geodesic in Zj , and its\nconstant term on Zj\u2212 is\n(Dij (s) \u2212 \u03b4ij h(l, s) + Cij (s) h(l, 1 \u2212 s).\nAccording to (26), the constant term on Zj+ is\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(Dij (s) \u2212 \u03b4ij ) \u03b1(s) h(l, s) + l1\u22122s \u03b2(s) h(l, 1 \u2212 s) (\u2212a)\n\u0002\n\u0003\n+ Cij (s) \u03b1(1 \u2212 s) h(l, 1 \u2212 s) + l1\u22122(1\u2212s) \u03b2(s) h(l, s) (\u2212a)\n\u0002\n\u0003\n= (Dij (s) \u2212 \u03b4ij )\u03b1(s) + Cij (s)l2s\u22121 \u03b2(1 \u2212 s) * h(l, s)(\u2212a)\n(27)\n\u0002\n\u0003\n+ (Dij (s) \u2212 \u03b4ij )l1\u22122s \u03b2(s) + Cij (s)\u03b1(1 \u2212 s) * h(l, 1 \u2212 s)(\u2212a),\n\nwhere \u03b1(s), \u03b2(s) are abbreviations for the coefficients in (26). If Re(s) > 1/2, this\nfunction must be square-integrable on the infinite half-cylinder Zj+ , so the coefficient\nof h(l, 1 \u2212 s) must be zero. This means\nDij (s) = \u03b4ij + (2s \u2212 1)\n\n4\u2212s \u0393(s)2\nCij (s) cos(\u03c0s)\u22121 l2s\u22121 .\n\u0393(1/2 + s)2\n\nNow suppose that j is a proper edge and l(j) 6= 0. The procedure to compute\nDij (s) in this case is similar: The constant term of Ei (s) \u2212 \u03b4ij \u03c7h(l(i), s) on Zj\u2212 is\n(Dij (s) \u2212 \u03b4ij ) h(l(j), s) + Cij (s) h(l(j), 1 \u2212 s),\n\u2212 \u223c\nand the constant term on Z\u03b9(j)\n= Zj+ is again given by (27). On the other hand,\nthe latter is equal to\n\u0001\nDi\u03b9(j) (s) \u2212 \u03b4i\u03b9(j) h(l(j), s)(\u2212a) + Ci\u03b9(j) (s) h(l(j), 1 \u2212 s)(\u2212a)\n\nby definition. Equating the coefficients we see\n\u0012\n\nDij (s) \u2212 \u03b4ij\nDi\u03b9(j) \u2212 \u03b4i\u03b9(j)\n\n\u0013\n\n= (2s \u2212 1)\n\n\u0012\n\u22121\n4\u2212s \u0393(s)2\n2s\u22121 cos(\u03c0s)\nl(j)\n2\n1\n\u0393(1/2 + s)\n\n1\ncos(\u03c0s)\u22121\n\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\nCij (s)\n*\n.\nCi\u03b9(j) (s)\n\nWe have determined the value of Dij (s) for all j with l(j) 6= 0. If l(j) = 0,\nthen Dij (s) \u2212 \u03b4ij = 0 immediately follows from the square-integrability of Ei (s) \u2212\n\u03c7h(l(i), s) on a cusp if Re(s) > 1/2.\n\u0003\n36\n\n\fTo state the Maass-Selberg relation, we need one more definition.\n3.6 Definition.

The approximate scattering matrix is symmetric, and it satisfies\nC(s) * D(s)t = D(s) * C(s).\nProof. We begin with proving C(s) * D(s)t = D(s) * C(s)t , and this will imply the\nsymmetry of C(s). It is sufficient to consider Re(s) > 1. There are no poles of\nC or of the approximate Eisenstein functions in this domain, and the truncated\nEisenstein series are square-integrable by definition. The Mass-Selberg relation for\ns = s\u2032 gives via the preceding lemma\nX\n(Die (s) Cje (s) \u2212 Cie (s) Dje (s))\n0 = (1 \u2212 2s)\ne\u2208S\u0303\n\n\u0001\n= (1 \u2212 2s) (D(s) C(s)t )ij \u2212 (C(s) D(s)t )ij ,\n\nso we have C(s) * D(s)t = D(s) * C(s)t . Lemma 3.5 implies that\nC(s)(1 + C(s)X)t = (1 + C(s)X)C(s)t\nholds for some symmetric matrix X, and in consequence\nC(s) + C(s)XC(s)t = C(s)t + C(s)XC(s)t .\n\n\u0003\nApparently, the matrices D(s) need not be symmetric in general. Rather, lemma\n3.5 gives\n4\u2212s \u0393(s)2\nD(s) \u2212 D(s)t = 1 + (2s \u2212 1)\nC(s)\u03a3(s)\u03bb2s\u22121\n\u0393(1/2 + s)2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n4\u2212s \u0393(s)2 2s\u22121\n\u03bb\n\u03a3(s)C(s)\n\u2212 1 + (2s \u2212 1)\n\u0393(1/2 + s)2\n\u0003\n4\u2212s \u0393(s)2 \u0002\n= (2s \u2212 1)\nC(s), \u03a3(s)\u03bb2s\u22121 .\n\u0393(1/2 + s)2\n\n(32)\n\nIn certain special cases, for example if all edges in the distinguished set S are\nphantom edges and the length l(i) is independent of i \u2208 S, the commutator in\nequation (32) vanishes.\nAs a second consequence of the Maass-Selberg relation, we obtain a functional\nequation for the approximate scattering matrices if the surface is of finite area. In\nthis situation, there is also a functional equation for the approximate Eisenstein\nfunctions, corollary 3.11.\n3.10 Corollary. The following functional equation holds if Y is of finite area:\nD(s) * D(1 \u2212 s)t = C(s) * C(1 \u2212 s).\n\n39\n\n\fProof. It suffices to prove the equation for all regular points s 6= 1/2, Re(s) = 1/2\nof the approximate Eisenstein functions. Let (sn )n and (tn )n be sequences in {w \u2208\nC | Re(w) > 1/2} that converge to s and 1\u2212s, respectively. We may assume that the\nEisenstein functions Ei (sn ), Ei (tn ) exist. The truncated ones EiA (sn ) and EiA (tn )\nare square-integrable, and the matrices C(sn ), D(sn ), C(tn ) and D(tn ) converge.\nIt is well-known in the classical theory of Eisenstein series that this implies the\nexistence of a uniform bound for the L2 -norms of EiA (sn ) and EiA (tn ) (cf. Kubota\n[16, theorem 4.1.2]). Therefore\nlim (sn (1 \u2212 sn ) \u2212 tn (1 \u2212 tn )) * hEiA (sn ) , EjA (t\u0304n )i = 0.\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nThe right-hand side of the Maass-Selberg relation converges to\n(1 \u2212 2s)\n\nX\ne\u2208S\u0303\n\n(Die (s) Dje (1 \u2212 s) \u2212 Cie (s) Cje (1 \u2212 s))\n= (1 \u2212 2s) D(s) * D(1 \u2212 s)t \u2212 C(s) * C(1 \u2212 s)t\n\n\u0001\n\nij\n\n.\n\u0003\n\n3.11 Corollary. Assume that Y is of finite area and that D(s) is meromorphically\ninvertible. Let E(s) be the column vector that has one entry Ej (s) for each j \u2208 S\u0303.\nThen the functional equation\nE(s) = C(s) D(1 \u2212 s)\u22121 * E(1 \u2212 s)\nholds.\nProof. We define a square matrix Q(s) = (qij (s)) from the constant terms of the\nEisenstein series, namely by\nqij (s) := Fj0 Ei (s).\nIf h(s) denotes the diagonal matrix with entries h(l(j), s), then\nQ(s) = D(s) h(s) + C(s), h(1 \u2212 s).\nThe functional equation 3.10 and the relation in 3.9 give\n0 = D(s) h(s) + C(s) h(1 \u2212 s)\n\n\u0001\n\u2212 C(s) D(1 \u2212 s)\u22121 * D(1 \u2212 s) h(1 \u2212 s) + C(1 \u2212 s) h(s)\n\n= Q(s) \u2212 C(s) D(1 \u2212 s)\u22121 * Q(1 \u2212 s).\n\nThe latter is the constant term matrix of the column E(s)\u2212C(s) D(1\u2212s)\u22121 E(1\u2212s).\nThis is zero for the following reasons:\n\u2022 Each entry is a linear combination of Eisenstein functions such that the constant term is 0 on each cylinder. Thus it is a meromorphic family of smooth\neigenfunctions of the Laplacian. But if Y is compact, the spectrum is discrete.\n\u2022 If Y is non-compact, this follows from vanishing of the constant term on the\ncusps as in Kubota [16, thm 4.4.2].\n\u0003\n\n40\n\n\fAt the end of this subsection, we want to say a few words on the finite-area assumption in the functional equations.\nUniform boundedness of L2 -norms, which allows to take the limit Re(s) \u2192 1/2\nof the Maass-Selberg relation, is essential in the proof. In the general case of\ngeometrically finite surface with possibly infinite area, one knows from the definition\nof the approximate Eisenstein functions in terms of the resolvent\n\u0001\nEiA (s) = O (Re(s) \u2212 1/2)\u22121 , Re(s) \u2192 1/2.\nThe Maass-Selberg relation improves this bound:\n\n3.12 Corollary. Let s \u2208 C \\ {1/2} with Re(s) = 1/2 be a regular point of the\napproximate Eisenstein functions, and let A be a positive number such that the\ntruncated functions below are defined. If (sn ) is a sequence in {w \u2208 C | Re(w) >\n1/2} that converges to s, then the norms EiA (sn ) L2 (Y ) satisfy\nEiA (sn )\n\nL2 (Y )\n\n\u0001\n= O (Re(sn ) \u2212 1/2)\u22121/2 , n \u2192 \u221e.\n\nProof. The Maass-Selberg relation for s = sn and s\u2032 = s\u0304n reads\n2\n\n(sn \u2212 s\u0304n )(1 \u2212 2 Re(sn )) EiA (s)\nX\n\u0001h\n2\nl(e)2 + A2 |Die (sn )| \u03c9l(e) (sn , s\u0304n ; \u2212A)\n=\ne\u2208S\u0303\n\n+ Die (sn ) Cie (s\u0304n ) \u03c9l(e) (sn , 1 \u2212 s\u0304n ; \u2212A)\n\n+ Cie (sn ) Die (s\u0304n ) \u03c9l(e) (1 \u2212 sn , s\u0304n ; \u2212A)\ni\n2\n+ |Cie (sn )| \u03c9l(e) (1 \u2212 sn , 1 \u2212 s\u0304n ; \u2212A) .\n\nThe assumptions now imply that the right-hand side of this formula converges to\nX\n\u0001\n(1 \u2212 2s)\n|Die (s)|2 \u2212 |Cie (s)|2 .\ne\u2208S\u0303\n\n\u0003\nOne might expect the EiA (sn ) in corollary 3.12 to satisfy a stronger estimate like\no((Re(sn ) \u2212 1/2)\u22121/2 ), so that the previous proof would lead to the same functional\nequation as in corollary 3.10. But it turns out that the limit\nX\n\u0001\n2\nlim (2 Re(sn ) \u2212 1) EiA (sn ) =\n|Die (s)|2 \u2212 |Cie (s)|2 .\nn\u2192\u221e\n\ne\u2208S\u0303\n\ndoes not vanish.\nUp to now, only the constant term in the Fourier decomposition of an eigenfunction\nwas given explicitly, namely as a linear combination of h(l, s) and h(l, 1 \u2212 s).

It follows from square-integrability that the coefficient of hn (l, 1 \u2212 s)\nvanishes if Re(s) > 1/2 and n 6= 0, so\nFen (Ej (s))(a) = c(s) hn (l, s)(a), a \u2208 (0, \u221e).\nThis shows\nZ\n\n\u221e\nA\n\n2\n\n|(Fen Ej (s))(a)| da \u223c |c(s)|\n\n2\n\nA1\u22122 Re(s)\n, Re(s) \u2192 1/2.\n2 Re(s) \u2212 1\n\nNow suppose that EjA (s) = o((Re(s) \u2212 1/2)\u22121/2 ) holds. The asymptotic shows\n2\nlimn |c(sn )| = 0 for each sequence (sn ) that converges from the right to a point\ns with Re(s) = 1/2. Thus the coefficient c(s) must vanish on the critical line.\nBut this means that c is the zero function, and therefore all higher Fourier modes\nFen Ej (s) vanish identically. This is not the case in general, because the approximate\nEisenstein functions do approximate the Eisenstein functions at least if Re(s) > 1/2.\n3.1.2\n\nApproximating the scattering theory of finite area surfaces\n\nWe proved in section 2 that the resolvent of the Laplacian depends continuously\non \u03bb \u2208 B, and this implies that the approximate Eisenstein functions Ej (s) and\nscattering matrices C(s) depend continuously on \u03bb if Re(s) > 1/2. In particular,\nif \u03bb0 = (l0 , \u03c40 ) \u2208 \u2202B satisfies l0 (j) = 0 for all j \u2208 S, and if (\u03bbn ) is a sequence in\nB that converges to \u03bb0 , then the approximate Eisenstein functions and scattering\nmatrices converge to Eisenstein series and scattering matrix of the limit surface in\nthe right half-plane. The following theorem summarises what was proved so far.\n3.13 Theorem. Let \u03bb0 \u2208 B and Re(s0 ) > 1/2 such that s0 (1 \u2212 s0 ) belongs to the\nresolvent set of the Laplacian on YG (\u03bb0 ).\n1. There exists a neighbourhood U \u2282 B of \u03bb0 and a neighbourhood V of s0 such\nthat each s \u2208 V is not in the spectrum of YG (\u03bb) for each \u03bb \u2208 U. In particular,\nthe approximate Eisenstein series Ei (\u03bb, s) and the matrices C(\u03bb, s) are always\ndefined, and so is D(\u03bb, s) if s \u2212 1/2 \u2208\n/ N.\n2. Let \u03a6\u2217 Ei (\u03bb, s) denote the pull-back of Ei (\u03bb, s) to YG (\u03bb0 ) via the trivialisation\nmaps from section 1. Then \u03a6\u2217 Ei (\u03bb, s) depends continuously on \u03bb \u2208 U and\ns \u2208 V in the sense of locally uniform convergence on YG (\u03bb0 ), the approximate\nscattering matrices C(\u03bb, s) and the D(\u03bbk , s) depend continuously on \u03bb.\nProof. Part 1 is only a reminder of theorem 2.14. Additional poles of D(\u03bb, s) at\ns \u2212 1/2 \u2208 N might appear due to the poles of s 7\u2192 h(l, 1 \u2212 s) (cf. lemma 3.4).\nTheorem 2.14 and remark 2.15 also show that \u03a6Ei (\u03bb, s) depends smoothly on s,\nat least up to the twist caused by a variation of \u03c4 . Now to determine the matrices\nC(\u03bb, s) and D(\u03bb, s), we only need the constant term of approximate Eisenstein\nfunctions and its first derivative in the complement of all closed geodesics that are\nassociated with edges of the graph.\n\u0003\nBehaviour of the approximate scattering data on the left of {s \u2208 C | Re(s) = 1/2}\nis completely different. We examine this under the assumption that all surfaces are\nof finite area, i.e. we fix an admissible graph G of type (p, 0) for the rest of this\nsection. There are no phantom edges, and YG (\u03bb) is compact for each \u03bb \u2208 int B. If\n42\n\n\f\u03bb \u2208 \u2202B then YG (\u03bb) is of finite area. We also fix a set S \u2282 G1 as in definition 3.3,\nand therefore the parameter space for surfaces must be restricted to\nBS := {(l, \u03c4 ) \u2208 B | l(d) 6= 0 if d \u2208\n/ S}.\nIn this situation, we can use the matrices D(\u03bb, s) in conjunction with the approximate Eisenstein functions and scattering matrices to achieve convergence on the\ncomplement of the critical axis, see the corollary below. Its proof is based on the\nfollowing asymptotic.\n3.14 Proposition. Let \u03bb0 = (l0 , \u03c40 ) \u2208 \u2202B satisfy l(d) = 0 for all d \u2208 S. Let (\u03bbk )\nbe a sequence in int B that converges to \u03bb0 . If Re(s) < 1/2, then\nC(\u03bbk , s) \u223c \u03bbk1\u22122s (1 \u2212 2s)\n\n4\u2212(1\u2212s) \u0393(1 \u2212 s)2\n\u03a3(1 \u2212 s),\n\u0393(3/2 \u2212 s)2\n\nk \u2192 \u221e,\n\nwhere the notation is that of lemma 3.5.\nProof. If \u03bb = (l, \u03c4 ) \u2208 int B, the resolvent s 7\u2192 (\u2206\u03bb \u2212 s(1 \u2212 s))\u22121 on YG (\u03bb) is\nmeromorphic on the complex plane for the spectrum is purely discrete. Thus the\napproximate Eisenstein functions are given by\n\u0001\nEi (\u03bb, s) = (\u2206\u03bb \u2212 s(1 \u2212 s))\u22121 [\u2206\u03bb , \u03c7]h(l(i), s) + \u03c7h(l(i), s)\n\neven if Re(s) < 1/2. Theorem 2.14 implies that the pull-back of Ei (\u03bbk , s) on YG (\u03bb0 )\nconverges to\n\u0001\n\u1ebci (s) := (\u2206\u03bb0 \u2212 s(1 \u2212 s))\u22121 [\u2206\u03bb0 , \u03c7]h(l0 (i), s) + \u03c7h(l0 (i), s) if Re(s) < 1/2.\n\nNote that \u1ebci (s) is defined in terms of the resolvent of the Laplacian, we do not\nneed a meromorphic continuation across the critical axis. So \u1ebci (s) \u2212 \u03c7h(l0 (i), s) is\nsquare-integrable, and the constant term of this function on Zj\u2212 is\nFj0 \u1ebci (s) = \u03b1ij (s) h(l0 (j), s) + \u03b2ij (s) h(l0 (j), 1 \u2212 s)\nwith \u03b2ij (s) = 0 if Re(s) < 1/2. On the other hand we know that \u03b2ij (s) is the limit\nof Cij (\u03bbk , s), and this gives\nlim C(\u03bbk , s) = 0, Re(s) < 1/2.\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\n(33)\n\nThe same can be concluded for D(\u03bbk , s) by the functional equation 3.10: We know\nthat D(\u03bb0 , s) is the identity matrix, and that it is the limit of D(\u03bbk , s) if Re(s) >\n1/2. This implies that s 7\u2192 D(\u03bbk , s) is meromorphically invertible if k is sufficiently\nlarge, and the functional equation gives\nD(\u03bbk , s) = C(\u03bbk , s) * C(\u03bbk , 1 \u2212 s) * (D(\u03bbk , 1 \u2212 s)t )\u22121 .\nIf Re(s) < 1/2 the rightmost factor converges to the identity and C(\u03bbk , 1 \u2212 s)\nconverges to the scattering matrix, so limk D(\u03bbk , s) = 0 follows from (33).\nNow the claim is proved by lemma 3.5:\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0012\n4\u2212s \u0393(s)2\n2s\u22121\n\u03a3(s)\u03bb\nC(\u03bbk , s) = (D(\u03bbk , s) \u2212 1) (2s \u2212 1)\n\u0393(1/2 + s)2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n4\u2212(1\u2212s) \u0393(1 \u2212 s)2\n1\u22122s\n\u03a3(1 \u2212 s) .\n= (D(\u03bbk , s) \u2212 1) \u2212\u03bb\n(1 \u2212 2s)\n\u0393(3/2 \u2212 s)2\n\u0003\n43\n\n\fProposition 3.14 suggests that the approximate scattering matrix should be replaced\nwith the matrix defined now.\n3.15 Definition. Let BS\u2032 be the set of all \u03bb \u2208 BS such that s 7\u2192 D(\u03bb, s) is meromorphically invertible. Then we define C \u2032(\u03bb, s) for each \u03bb \u2208 BS\u2032 to be the meromorphic\nfamily in s given by\nC \u2032(\u03bb, s) := D(\u03bb, s)\u22121 * C(\u03bb, s).\nOf course it is sufficient to require D(\u03bb, s) to be invertible for some s in the definition\nof BS\u2032 . This always holds true if YG (\u03bb) is compact, so we have int B \u2282 BS\u2032 (note\nthat D(\u03bb, s) is the identity matrix for each s \u2208 \u22121/2 \u2212 N by lemma 3.5).\nRecall that D(\u03bb, s) = 1 if \u03bb(j) = 0 holds for each j \u2208 S, so C \u2032(\u03bb, s) again coincides\nwith the scattering matrix. It turns out that there are additional properties that\nC \u2032(\u03bb, s) shares with scattering matrices.\n3.16 Lemma. The C \u2032(\u03bb, s) are symmetric, they are unitary if Re(s) = 1/2, and\nthey satisfy the functional equation\nC \u2032(\u03bb, 1 \u2212 s) * C \u2032(\u03bb, s) = 1.\nProof. We leave out \u03bb in the notation. Symmetry is a consequence of both statements in corollary 3.9:\n\u0001t\n\u0001\u22121\nC \u2032(s) = C(s) * D(s)t\n= D(s)\u22121 * C(s) = C \u2032(s).\n\nBy definition of C \u2032 this implies\n\nC \u2032(1 \u2212 s) * C \u2032(s) = C \u2032(1 \u2212 s)t * C \u2032(s) = C(1 \u2212 s) * D(s) D(1 \u2212 s)t\nand this is the identity matrix by 3.10. So if Re(s) = 1/2\n\n\u0001\u22121\n\n* C(s),\n\nC \u2032(s)\u2217 = C \u2032(s\u0304)t = C \u2032(s\u0304) = C \u2032(1 \u2212 s) = C \u2032(s)\u22121 .\n\u0003\nWe conclude this section with a corollary of theorem 3.13, of the functional equation\nfor C \u2032 , and of corollary 3.11.\n3.17 Corollary. Let E(\u03bb, s) be the column vector of approximate Eisenstein functions as in corollary 3.11, and let E \u2032 (\u03bb, s) := D(\u03bb, s)\u22121 * E(\u03bb, s). Then\ns 7\u2192 \u03a6\u2217 E \u2032 (\u03bb, s)\n\nand\n\ns 7\u2192 C \u2032(\u03bb, s)\n\ndepend continuously on \u03bb \u2208 BS\u2032 as meromorphic families on {s \u2208 C | Re(s) 6= 1/2}.\n\n3.2\n\nThe Selberg Zeta function\n\nWe extend proposition 1.8 to the domain Re(s) > 1/2, thus proving Wolpert's\nsecond conjecture. As in section 1.4, Z\u03bb is the Selberg Zeta function of YG (\u03bb), and\nthe contribution of a particular edge d \u2208 G\u22171 to the Zeta function is denoted by\nZd,\u03bb .\n3.18 Theorem. With respect to the topology of locally\nQ uniform convergence of\nfunctions on {s \u2208 C | Re(s) > 1/2}, the map \u03bb 7\u2192 Z\u03bb / d\u2208G\u2217 Zd,\u03bb is continuous on\n1\nB.\n\n44\n\n\fBefore we come to the proof, let us state an immediate corollary of this theorem\nand of the functional equation for Z\u03bb for surfaces of finite area. It can be used\nto show that there is no straight-forward extension of theorem 3.18 to the left of\nthe critical axis [25]. At the end of this section, we will use this corollary to prove\ntheorem 3.23, which covers 3.18 but adds convergence on the left half-plane if the\nnon-degenerate surfaces are compact.\n3.19 Corollary. Let \u03bb0 = (l0 , \u03c40 ) \u2208 \u2202B be a point where Y (\u03bb0 ) is the union of\nelementary cusps and a surface of finite area. The area of the latter surface is\ndenoted by |F |. Let (\u03bbm ) be a sequence in B that converges to \u03bb0 . Then\nZ\u03bbm (s)\n= \u00b1Z\u03bb0 (1 \u2212 s) det(C(\u03bb0 , 1 \u2212 s)) *\nlim Q\nm\u2192\u221e\nd\u2208S Zd,\u03bbm (s)\n\u0012\nZ\n* exp |F |\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0393(1/2 + s)\n\u0393(3/2 \u2212 s)\n\n\u0013k\n\ns\u22121/2\n\nt tanh(\u03c0t)dt + (2s \u2212 1)k log 2\n\n0\n\n\u0013\n\nholds in {s \u2208 C | Re(s) > 1/2}. Here C(\u03bb0 , s) is the scattering matrix of Y (\u03bb0 ),\nand k is the number of cusps. In particular, if the Y (\u03bbn ) are compact for all n 6= 0,\nwe have for Re(s) > 1/2\n\u0013k\n\u0012\nZ\u03bb (1 \u2212 s)\n\u0393(1/2 + s)\n.\nlim Q m\n= Z\u03bb0 (1 \u2212 s) det(C(\u03bb0 , 1 \u2212 s)) * 2(2s\u22121)k\nm\u2192\u221e\n\u0393(3/2 \u2212 s)\nd\u2208S Zd,\u03bbm (s)\n\nThe sign in the first formula above depends on the determinant of the scattering\nmatrix for Y (\u03bb0 ) at s = 1/2. According to Lax and Phillips [17, Prop. 8.14], this\ndeterminant equals (\u22121)k . It vanishes in the second formula as the number of cusps\nis even and there are no elementary components.\nNow we prove Theorem 3.18. The logarithmic derivative of Z\u03bb is related with the\nresolvent of the Laplacian by the trace formula, as stated in appendix B.

By d(z1 , z2 ) we mean the hyperbolic distance between two points. Let \u0393 denote\na finitely generated group without torsion that admits a continuous family \u03c6 : B \u2192\nhom(\u0393, isom(D)) of discrete inclusions into the orientation-preserving isometries of\nD. The image of \u03c6(b) is denoted by \u0393b , and the image of any \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 under \u03c6(b)\nby \u03b3b . By continuity we mean that b 7\u2192 \u03b3b is a continuous map for each \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393.\nThis is equivalent to the continuity of b 7\u2192 \u0393b , where the set of closed subgroups\nof isom(D) carries the Chabauty topology. We assume B to be a path-connected,\nlocally compact and metrisable space.\nWe assume that the \u0393b are non-elementary. The only element of finite order in \u0393b\nis the identity. An action of \u0393 on B \u00d7 D is defined by \u03b3(b, z) := (b, \u03b3b z). Our first\nobservation is that this action is freely discontinuous, i.e. every element of B \u00d7 D\nhas a neighbourhood U such that \u03b3U \u2229 U 6= \u2205 implies \u03b3 = 1.\nA.1 Lemma. The induced action of \u0393 on B \u00d7 D is freely discontinuous.\nProof. We use the fact that the inequality\nsinh(d(z, \u03b31 z)/2) sinh(d(z, \u03b32 z)/2) \u2265 1\nis satisfied for any z \u2208 D if the group generated by \u03b31 , \u03b32 \u2208 isom(D) is torsion-free\nand non-elementary (Beardon [1, \u00a78.3, p. 198]).\nLet (b0 , z0 ) \u2208 B \u00d7 D, the aim is to prove that \u0393 acts freely discontinuously in\n(b0 , z0 ). Choose \u03c4 \u2208 \u0393 \\ {1}. Since B is locally compact, there exist neighbourhoods\nV \u2282 B of b0 and W \u2282 D of z0 such that d(\u03c6(b)(\u03c4 )z, z) > \u01eb > 0 for all (b, z) \u2208\nV \u00d7 W . The cited inequality implies d(\u03c6(b)(\u03b3)z, z) > 2 Arsinh(\u01eb\u22121 ) for (b, z) \u2208\nV \u00d7 W if \u03b3 is not contained in the centraliser Z(\u03c4 ). Now the images of Z(\u03c4 ) under\nthe homomorphisms considered are elementary and discrete, so we may choose a\nneighbourhood U \u2032 of (b0 , z0 ) with the desired property for Z(\u03c4 ). Then\n\b\n\u0001\nU \u2032 \u2229 V \u00d7 z \u2208 D | d(z, z0 ) < Arsinh(\u01eb\u22121 ) \u2229 W\nis a suitable neighbourhood of (b0 , z0 ).\n\n\u0003\n\n49\n\n\fThe previous lemma allows for a definition of \u0393-invariant structures on B \u00d7 D,\ne.g. Riemannian metrics or vector fields if the action of \u0393 is differentiable. We\nwill stick to the latter in order to define locally a trivialisation of the quotient\n\u0393\\E \u2192 B, where E denotes the fibre-wise Nielsen domain for the group action. We\nmust restrict to the Nielsen domain as we explicitly want to allow the type of an\nisometry \u03b3b to change from parabolic to hyperbolic and vice versa.\nOf particular importance in this respect are those primitive elements of a Fuchsian\ngroup that are related to the infinite parts of the corresponding quotient of the\nhyperbolic plane. They are specified in the following definition.\nA.2 Definition. An element \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 \\ {1} is called a boundary pairing if it is not\na proper multiple of any other element of \u0393, and if there exists b \u2208 B such that \u03b3b\neither is parabolic or it leaves invariant a component of the set of discontinuity in\n\u2202D.\nThe definition refers to a property of \u03b3b for some particular b \u2208 B, but the next\nlemma shows that it is in fact independent of b.\nA.3 Lemma. If \u03b3 is a boundary pairing, then the condition in definition A.2 is\nsatisfied by \u03b3b for all b \u2208 B.\nProof. Suppose that the condition is satisfied by \u03b3b0 but not by \u03b3b1 . There exists\na curve t 7\u2192 bt from b0 to b1 , and two curves c1 , c2 in \u2202D such that c1 (t) and c2 (t)\nare the fixed points of \u03b3bt for all t. The fixed points of non-trivial elements of \u0393b1\nare dense in the limit set. By assumption, \u03b3b1 is hyperbolic and each component\nof \u2202D \\ {c1 (1), c2 (1)} contains a fixed point of an element \u03b7b1 or \u03b7b\u2032 1 . Now \u2202D \\\n{c1 (0), c2 (0)} either consists of one component, or one of its components is a subset\nof the set of discontinuity. This implies that the intersection of {c1 (t), c2 (t)} with\n\u2032\nthe set of fixed points of \u03b7b(t) or \u03b7b(t)\nis not empty for some t. This is a contradiction\nto discreteness of \u0393b(t) .\n\u0003\nNow we want to construct a trivialisation of \u0393\\E \u2192 B from an invariant vector field\ns on B \u00d7 D. For convenience we restrict to a smooth family of Fuchsian groups\nparametrised by a compact interval B. Let \u0393\u2032 \u2282 \u0393 be the set of boundary pairings.\nLet us recall the definition of E. If \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393\u2032 and \u03b3b is hyperbolic, its axis separates D\ninto two components. Precisely one of them, denoted by D\u03b3\u22a5 (b), is not bounded at\n\u2202D by a component of the set of discontinuity. If \u03b3b is parabolic, we define D\u03b3\u22a5 (b)\nto be empty. Then the fibre-wise Nielsen domain is the following \u0393-invariant subset\nof B \u00d7 D:\n[ \\\nE :=\n{b} \u00d7 D\u03b3\u22a5 (b).\nb\u2208B \u03b3\u2208\u0393\u2032\n\nThe projection \u0393\\E \u2192 B is not a proper map if any of the Fuchsian groups contain\nparabolic elements. If we want to apply the flow of a vector field to trivialise this\nmap, we must impose additional conditions on the vector field. These ensure that\nfor each compact neighbourhood U \u2282 int B of a point b0 there exists a relatively\ncompact set K \u2282 D such that the following holds:\n\u2022 If \u03a6b : U \u00d7 K \u2192 B \u00d7 D, |b \u2212 b0 | < \u01eb, denotes the flow of the vector field, then\nE is invariant under \u03a6t .\n\u2022 The map \u03a6b |{b0 }\u00d7K extends to a diffeomorphism Eb0 \u2192 Eb for all |b \u2212 b0 | < \u01eb.\nEssentially this means that we must require the vector field to be well-behaved\nnear the fibre-wise boundary of \u0393\\E \u2282 \u0393\\(B \u00d7 D). We give a precise definition of a\nneighbourhood of this boundary in terms of covering subsets C\u0303\u03b3 of collars (figure 5):\n50\n\n\fThere is an open subset C\u0303\u03b3 of E associated with each \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393\u2032 . If l(\u03b3b ) denotes\nthe hyperbolic translation of \u03b3b , resp. l(\u03b3b ) = 0 if \u03b3b is parabolic, there exists an\n\u2212\norientation preserving isometry Xl(\u03b3\n\u2192 D\u03b3\u22a5 (b) such that the isometry (x, a) 7\u2192\nb)\n\u2212\n\u22a5\n(x \u00b1 1, a) of Xl(\u03b3b ) \u2192 D\u03b3 (b) corresponds to \u03b3b (cf. p. 7). The isometry is uniquely\ndetermined up to composition on the left with maps (x, a) 7\u2192 (x + \u03b4, a). So we can\nA(l(\u03b3 ))\ndefine the fibre of C\u0303\u03b3 over b to be the the image of Xl(\u03b3b ) b , where\nA(l) =\n\n(\n\nl\n,0\n\u2212 2 sinh(l/2)\n\n(\u22121, 0)\n\n\u0001\n\nif l 6= 0\n\nif l = 0.\n\nIf l0 satisfies l0 < l(\u03b3b ) for all b \u2208 B, we define C\u0303\u03b3l0 \u2282 C\u0303\u03b3 as the fibre-wise image\nA(l )\n\nof Xl(\u03b3b0) . The Fuchsian groups are required to be geometrically finite, so there are\nonly finitely many conjugacy classes of boundary pairings. This implies that such\na number l0 can be chosen independently of \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393\u2032 .\nA.4 Lemma. Let s be a smooth, \u0393-invariant lift of the canonical vector field \u2202b on\nthe interval\nS B. l0Provided that the integral flow of s defines a diffeomorphism of the\nfibres of\n\u03b3 C\u0303\u03b3 \u2192 B for some l0 > 0, it extends these diffeomorphisms to a local\ntrivialisation of E \u2192 B.\nProof. We verify that the two properties above are satisfied. Invariance of E is\nimmediate from the condition on s.\nThe set K will be defined in terms of Dirichlet domains for the Fuchsian groups.\nChoose z0 \u2208 D. If \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 and b \u2208 B, the open half-plane\nD\u03b3 (b) := {z \u2208 D | d(z, z0 ) < d(z, \u03b3b z0 )}\nis bounded by the geodesic\n\nL\u03b3 (b) := {z \u2208 D | d(z, z0 ) = d(z, \u03b3b z0 )}.\nT\nThe Dirichlet domain D(b) of \u0393b with centre z0 is \u03b3 D\u03b3 (b). Due to finite geometry,\nfor fixed b \u2208 B this intersection can by replaced with an intersection of finitely many\nhalf-planes, say of those associated with \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3n \u2208 \u0393.\nWe need to have a closer look at those points where the Euclidean closure of D(b)\nmeets \u2202D. This only happens in a component of the set of discontinuity or in a\nparabolic fixed point for the following reason: The limit set of a geometrically finite\ngroup only consists of conical limit points and parabolic fixed points. But a convex\nfundamental polygon of such a group cannot meet \u2202D in a point of approximation\n[1, thm 10.2.3 and thm 10.2.5]. This observation implies the existence of finitely\nmany boundary pairings \u03b71 , . . . , \u03b7j and of a compact neighbourhood K of z0 such\nthat\nj \u0010\n\u0011\n[\nD(b) \\ K \u2282\n(39)\nD\u03b7\u22a5k (b) \u222a C\u0303\u03b7l0k\nk=1\n\n(this is illustrated in figure 5).\nthe Dirichlet domain D(b\u2032 ) is always\nTn Moreover,\n\u2032\ncontained in the intersection k=1 D\u03b3k (b ), so the compact set K may be chosen\nsuch that (39) holds if b is replaced with any element b\u2032 of a suitable neighbourhood\nof b. If U \u2282 B is a compact neighbourhood with this property, we only need to\n\u0003\napply the integral flow to U \u00d7 K and to each C\u0303\u03b3l0 separately.\n\n51\n\n\fD(b)\n\nL\u03b31\n\nz0\n\u2202 C\u0303\u03b72\n\n\u2202 C\u0303\u03b71\n\u2202D\u03b7\u22a51\n\nL\u03b34\n\nL\u03b33\n\nL\u03b32\n\u2202K\n\nFigure 5: Trimming of a Dirichlet domain\n\nB\n\nThe Selberg trace formula\n\nThe trace formula as formulated by Selberg [23] expresses the trace of certain operators h\u0303(\u2206) in terms of the closed geodesics on a geometrically finite surface. Difficulties may arise since the spectrum of \u2206 is not discrete for non-compact surfaces.\nIn this appendix, we will only state a rudimentary version of this trace formula in\nthe sense that it computes the distributional trace of an operator by integration of\nits integral kernel over the diagonal, but the result is not known to be related to the\ntrace of a trace class operator a priori. Such a relation is established in a special\ncase only, in section 3.2, where the operator is some kind of relative resolvent of the\nLaplacian (cf. p. 29 for the definition).\nFor suitable functions h\u0303, the Selberg transform provides an explicit formula for the\nintegral kernel of h\u0303(\u2206). The kernel on the hyperbolic plane is given by\n(z1 , z2 ) 7\u2212\u2192 k(4 sinh2 (d(z1 , z2 )/2)),\nwhere k is related to the function h : \u03be 7\u2192 h\u0303(1/4 + \u03be 2 ) by\nZ \u221e\nZ\n1 \u221e dQ(w)\nk(t)\n\u221a\n\u221a\ndt = Q(w),\nk(t) = \u2212\n,\n\u03c0 t\nw\u2212t\nt\u2212w\nw\n\n1\ng(u) =\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\nQ(eu + e\u2212u \u2212 2) = g(u),\nZ \u221e\n\u2212i\u03beu\nh(\u03be)e\nd\u03be,\ng(u)ei\u03beu du = h(\u03be).\n\u2212\u221e\n\nFor the time being, we only consider those operators with an integral kernel that\ncan be derived from k by summation over a uniformising group. To specify a\nclass of functions h that meet this condition, we prove the following lemma. It is\ncertainly well-known, but to our knowledge the complete proof is only implicit in\nthe literature, so we give it here for the sake of completeness (c.f. Hejhal [8]).\nB.1 Lemma. Let h be an analytic function in {\u03be \u2208 C | |Im(\u03be)| < 1/2 + \u03b4} satisfying\n2\nh(\u03be) = h(\u2212\u03be) and |h(\u03be)| \u2264 M (1 + |Re(\u03be)| )\u2212(1+\u03b1) . Then k is continuous on [0, \u221e)\nand there exist numbers C\u03c1 for all \u03c1 < \u03b4 such that\n|g(u)| \u2264 C\u03c1 e\u2212(1/2+\u03c1) |u|\n\nand\n\n|k(t)| \u2264 C\u03c1 (1 + t)\u2212(1+\u03c1) .\n\n(40)\n\nConversely, if we start with a continuous function k on [0, \u221e) with |k(t)| \u2264 C\u03c1 (1 +\nt)\u2212(1+\u03c1) for \u03c1 < \u03b4 and we apply the inverse transformations, then g satisfies estimates as above and h is analytic in the strip.\n52\n\n\fProof. The relation between g and h is an immediate consequence of the Cauchy\nintegral formula. The final assertion is also easy to see: Given k, the function Q is\ncontinuous and the estimate for g follows from\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n(1 + t)\u2212(1+\u03c1)\n\u2212(1/2+\u03c1\u2212\u01eb)\n\u221a\ndt \u2264 (1 + w)\n(1 + t + w)\u2212(1/2+\u01eb) t\u22121/2 dt.\nt\u2212w\n0\nw\n\nSo we proceed with the main part. A function h that meets the assumptions gives\nrise to an element g of the Sobolev space H3/2+\u03b1 (R), because the following function\nis square-integrable:\n\u03be 7\u2212\u2192 (1 + \u03be 2 )1/2(3/2+\u03b1) h(\u03be).\n\nNow 3/2 + \u03b1 > 1 + (dim R)/2 holds, so the Sobolev embedding theorem implies\ng \u2208 C1,\u03b3 (R) for \u03b3 < \u03b1. H\u00f6lder continuity of the derivative g \u2032 implies continuity of\nk at 0:\nZ\n1 \u221e g \u2032 (Arcosh(1 + w+t\n2 ))\np\nk(t) = \u2212\ndw,\n\u03c0 0\nw(w + t)(w + t + 4)\nand using g \u2032 (0) = 0, the integrand can be estimated near 0 by\n\u0001\u03b3\n\u221a\n\u03b3\nArcosh(1 + w+t\nw+t\n2 )\np\n\u2264 p\n\u2264 w\u22121+\u03b3/2 .\nw(w + t)(w + t + 4)\nw(w + t)(w + t + 4)\n\nTo derive the bounds for k, we use the fact that\n\nf : {\u03be \u2208 C | |Im \u03be| < 1/2 + \u03b4} \u2212\u2192 C,\n\n\u03be 7\u2212\u2192 \u2212i\u03beh(\u03be)\n\nis an analytic function which satisfies\nsup\n|\u03b7|<1/2+\u03b4\n\nkf (* + i\u03b7)kL2 (R) < \u221e.\n\nThe Fourier transform of f is g \u2032 . Therefore (cf. Reed-Simon [20, p. 18]) the function\nu 7\u2192 eb|u| g \u2032 (u) is square-integrable for any b < 1/2 + \u03b4, and we see\nZ\n1 \u221e Q\u2032 (w)dw\n\u221a\nk(t) = \u2212\n\u03c0 t\nw\u2212t\n\u0012Z t+t\u22122\u03b4 \u2032\n\u0013\nZ \u221e\n1\ng \u2032 (u)du\nQ (w)dw\n\u221a\np\n=\u2212\n+\n.\n\u03c0 t\nw\u2212t\n2(cosh(u) \u2212 1) \u2212 t\nArcosh(1+(t+t\u22122\u03b4 )/2)\n\nWe use boundedness of g \u2032 for the first integral, and the second is estimated with\nthe Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for some b = b1 + b2 < 1/2 + \u03b4:\n\u22122\u03b4\nZ\nkg \u2032 k\u221e t+t\n((w \u2212 t)w(w + 4))\u22121/2 dw\n|k(t)| \u2264\n\u03c0\nt\n\u0012Z \u221e\n\u00131/2\n1\n2\n\u2212(1\u22122b1 )u \u2032\ne\n|g (u)| du\n+\n\u03c0 Arcosh(1+(t+t\u22122\u03b4 )/2)\n\u0012Z \u221e\n\u00131/2\ne(1\u22122b1 )u du\n*\nArcosh(1+(t+t\u22122\u03b4 )/2) 2(cosh(u) \u2212 1) \u2212 t\nZ \u22122\u03b4\n\u2032\nkg k\u221e \u22121 t\nt\nw\u22121/2 dw\n\u2264\n\u03c0\n0\n\u0012Z \u221e\n\u00131/2\n1 \u2212(1/2+b2 ) Arcosh(1+(t+t\u22122\u03b4 )/2)\n2\n2bu \u2032\ne |g (u)| du\n+ e\n\u03c0\nArcosh(1+(t+t\u22122\u03b4 )/2)\n\u00131/2\n\u0012Z \u221e\n\u221a \u221a\n\u22121 (1\u22122b1 ) Arcosh(1+w/2)\ndw\n*\n((w \u2212 t) w w + 4) e\nt+t\u22122\u03b4\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2264\n\n2 kg k\u221e \u2212(1+\u03b4)\nt\n+ C(1 + t)\u2212(1/2+b2 ) .\n\u03c0\n53\n\n\f\u221a\nThe last line follows from eArcosh v = v + v 2 \u2212 1. This proves the bound for k as\nb2 may be chosen arbitrarily close to 1/2 + \u03b4.\n\u0003\nNow assume that k \u2208 C([0, \u221e)) satisfies |k(t)| \u2264 C\u03c1 (1 + t)\u2212(1+\u03c1) for all \u03c1 < \u03b4. Let\nY \u2032 be a connected, geometrically finite surface. We choose a uniformising group\n\u0393\u2032 \u2282 isom(D) and identify Y \u2032 with \u0393\u2032 \\D. The critical exponent of a Fuchsian\ngroup is less than or equal to one, and therefore the series\nX\nK\u0393\u2032 (z1 , z2 ) :=\nk(4 sinh2 (d(z1 , \u03b3z2 )/2))\n\u03b3\u2208\u0393\u2032\n\nis absolutely convergent for z1 , z2 \u2208 D. It defines a \u0393\u2032 \u00d7 \u0393\u2032 -invariant function, so\nlet KY \u2032 : Y \u2032 \u00d7 Y \u2032 \u2192 C denote the function induced on the quotient. We would\nlike to integrate KY \u2032 over the diagonal in Y \u2032 \u00d7 Y \u2032 , but the integral might diverge\nfor two reasons, either due to the growth of the kernel (if the surface has cusps)\nor because of the surface having infinite area (in the presence of funnels). We will\nsimply subtract the divergent parts.\nConsider Y \u2032 to be a component of Y = YG (\u03bb) as defined in section 1. An edge\nd \u2208 G\u22171 with l(d) = 0 represents a pair of cusps Zd \u2282 Y . We adjoin an extra pair\nof cusps Z\u0304d , which is by definition an isometric copy of the elementary quotient\nh(x, a) 7\u2192 (x + 1, a)i\\X0 . The resulting surface is a disjoint union\n[\nZ\u0304d ,\nY + := Y \u222a\nd\u2208G\u2217\n1\nl(d)=0\n\nand we will integrate over Y + the function K 0 defined component-wise by\n(\nif z \u2208 Y \u2032 \u2282 Y ,\nKY \u2032 (z, z) \u2212 k(0)\n0\nK (z) :=\n\u2212(KY \u2032 (z, z) \u2212 k(0)) if z \u2208 Z\u0304d \u2282 Y + \\ Y .\nThe constant k(0) is subtracted to avoid difficulties with integration over infinitearea surfaces. Finally, we need a family of cut-off functions \u03c7A : Y + \u2192 {0, 1} that\nvanish in the cuspidal ends of area A:\n[\nZd \u222a Z\u0304d and |a| < A.\n\u03c7A (z) = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 z = (x, a) \u2208\nl(d)=0\n\nB.2 Theorem (Selberg). Let C denote the set of oriented, simple, closed geodesics\nin Y , and l(c) the length of a curve c \u2208 C. Then the following formula holds:\nZ\n\u221e\nXX\nl(c)g(nl(c))\nlim\n\u03c7A K 0 vol =\n.\n(41)\nnl(c)/2 \u2212 e\u2212nl(c)/2\nA\u21920 Y +\ne\nc\u2208C n=1\nThe proof is given in Selberg's G\u00f6ttingen lectures, in Hejhal's monograph [9] or by\nVenkov [24], one only needs to pay attention to the following facts.\nAssume the function k to be positive first. For every component Y \u2032 of Y we fix a\ncomplete set B \u2032 of representatives for the conjugacy classes of hyperbolic elements\nin \u0393\u2032 . The famous calculation of Selberg's [23, 9], in connection with Beppo Levi's\ntheorem, shows that\nX Z X\nX Z\nX\n\u03c7\u0303A (z)k(\u03c3(z, \u03b3z)) vol(z) \u2212\n\u03c7\u0303A (z)k(\u03c3(z, \u03b3z)) vol(z)\nY \u2032 \u2282Y\n\nF\n\nY \u2032 \u2282Y\n\n\u03b3\u2208\u0393\u2032\n\u03b36=1\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nX X\n\nF\n\nY \u2032 \u2282Y \u03b3\u2208B \u2032\n\n54\n\n\u03b3\u2208\u0393\u2032\nparabolic\n\nl(\u03b30 )g(l(\u03b3))\n,\nel(\u03b3)/2 \u2212 e\u2212l(\u03b3)/2\n\nA \u2192 0, (42)\n\n\fwhere \u03b30 denotes the unique primitive element of \u0393\u2032 such that \u03b3 = \u03b30n holds for some\npositive n, and l(\u03b3) is the hyperbolic translation of \u03b3. The domain F of integration\nis a suitable fundamental domain for \u0393\u2032 and \u03c3(z1 , z2 ) = 4 sinh2 (d(z1 , z2 )/2). The\ninfinite series on the right-hand side converges since\n#{\u03b3 \u2208 B \u2032 | el(\u03b3) \u2264 x} = O(x), x \u2192 \u221e\nand g satisfies g(u) \u2264 Ce\u2212(1/2+\u03c1)|u| by lemma B.1.\n\nIf k is not positive, we see that Lebesgue's theorem on dominated convergence\nimplies that the positivity condition on k may be dropped in equation (42).
