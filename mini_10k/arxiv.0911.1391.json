At low\nenergies, interacting one-dimensional (1D) systems are\ndescribed by the Luttinger model,1 which predicts that\nthe collective spin and charge modes are decoupled and\npropagate with different velocities. Away from the lowenergy limit, spin-charge separation holds in the sense\nthat spinon and holon branches can still be identified\nin some momentum-resolved experiments such as angleresolved photoemission,4 but charge and spin degrees of\nfreedom are inevitably coupled by dispersion nonlinearity. A direct consequence is that at finite energies spin\nexcitations can contribute to charge responses.5,6\nRecently the effects of nonlinear dispersion in dynamical properties of Luttinger liquids have been\nemphasized.7 In particular, the interplay of band curvature and interactions is essential for the interpretation of\nCoulomb drag experiments in parallel quantum wires.8,9\nAs discussed by Pustilnik et al.,10 the Luttinger model\ncannot account for the leading contribution to the drag\nresistivity when there is a density mismatch between the\nwires, in which case interwire backscattering processes\nare exponentially suppressed at low temperatures. The\nother type of low-energy process, long-wavelength scattering, is ineffective within the Luttinger model because\nthe dynamic charge structure factor (DCSF) S(q, \u03c9) for\nsmall wavevector q is given by a delta function peak at the\nenergy of a free boson. In this approximation, the DCSFs\nof two wires with different densities have no overlap and\nthe drag resistivity vanishes. For spinless fermions,10 it is\nknown that nonlinear dispersion is responsible for broadening the DCSF into a rectangular line shape with width\nproportional to q 2 .11,12 This effect restores a smooth density dependence of the drag resistivity.\nIn this work we study the DCSF of spin-1/2 fermions\nin the limit of small q and at zero magnetic field. Our\nmotivation comes from the search for Luttinger liquid\n\nbehavior in experiments with vertically coupled quantum wires, in which drag is enhanced by a smaller interwire separation and the densities in each wire can be\ntuned independently.13 We are interested in the possibility that spinons give a contribution to the drag resistivity via spin-charge coupling at finite energies. This\neffect can not be described by the Luttinger model since\nit depends on violating particle-hole symmetry. In order\nto calculate the DCSF, we follow the approach of treating band curvature as a perturbation to the Luttinger\nmodel, and resort to refermionization of the collective\nmodes in the cases where perturbation theory is singular.\nWhile the drag response depends mostly on the spectral\nweight and width of the peaks as a function of wavevector and temperature, we also discuss other features of\nthe DCSF that are of general interest for the dynamics of spin-1/2 fermions. These features could be directly\nprobed by momentum-resolved techniques, such as Bragg\nspectroscopy in cold Fermi gases.14 We show that at zero\ntemperature the charge peak has a q 2 -scaling width, like\nin the spinless case, but there is also a peak due to spin\nexcitations which resembles the dynamic spin structure\nfactor (DSSF) of Heisenberg spin chains. At zero temperature, the DCSF diverges at the lower edge of the spin\npeak as a power law with exponent \u03bcs\u2212 = \u22121/2 + O(q 2 ).\nAt finite temperature, the spin peak is broadened by diffusion.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we present\nthe linear response formula for the drag resistivity and\ndiscuss its relation to the problem of the DCSF of spin1/2 fermions with nonlinear dispersion. In Sec. III, we\nderive the effective bosonic Hamiltonian including irrelevant operators associated with band curvature, some of\nwhich couple charge and spin degrees of freedom. In Sec.\nIV, we describe the line shape of the DCSF in the limit of\nsmall q at zero temperature. Finite temperature effects\nare also discussed. In Sec. V, the approximation for the\nDCSF is applied to calculate the density and temperature\ndependence of the drag resistivity. Finally, we summarize\nthe results in Sec. VI.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nCOULOMB DRAG AND DYNAMIC\nCHARGE RESPONSE\n\nThe drag resistivity between two capacitively coupled wires of length L is defined as the ratio r =\n\u2212(e2 /2\u03c0~)V2 /I1 L, where V2 is the voltage induced across\nwire 2 (called the drag wire) when a current I1 is driven\nthrough wire 1 (called the drive wire). For the typical\nsetup, see Refs. 8,9. Let us assume clean wires (L smaller\nthan the mean free path due to impurities) and temperature regime kB T \u001d ~vF i /L, where vF i , i = 1, 2, is\nthe Fermi velocity for electrons in each wire. The latter\ncondition rules out finite size effects which are known to\nproduce oscillations in the drag response as a function of\ndrive voltage.15 Hereafter we set ~ = kB = 1. In the linear response regime, the drag resistivity at temperature\nT is given by10\nZ \u221e Z \u221e\nq 2 A1 (q, \u03c9)A2 (q, \u03c9)\nU2\nd\u03c9\ndq\n, (1)\nr=\n4\u03c0 3 \u03bd1 \u03bd2 T 0\nsinh2 (\u03c9/2T )\n0\nwhere U is the interwire Coulomb interaction, \u03bdi is the\ncharge density and Ai (q, \u03c9) is minus the imaginary part\nof the retarded density-density correlation function in\nwire i = 1, 2. Eq. (1) expresses the drag resistivity as\na functional of the dynamic density-density correlation\nfunction of two decoupled wires. Due to Boltzmann factors, the nonzero response comes from the overlap of A1\nand A2 integrated up to frequencies of order T . At low\ntemperatures compared to the Fermi energies \u000fF i of the\nwires, and neglecting interwire backscattering, the main\ncontribution to the integral in Eq. (1) is due to small-q\n(or forward) scattering.10\nOur goal is to derive an aproximation for A(q, \u03c9) in\na single wire in the limit q \u001c kF i and \u03c9 \u001c \u000fF i . From\nthis point until Sec. IV, we will be concerned with the\ndynamic response of a single wire and will omit the wire\nindex i = 1, 2. The wire index will be restored in Sec. V\nwhen we return to Eq. (1) to compute the drag resistivity.\nIn order to describe the intrawire interactions, we\nconsider a Galilean-invariant model with electron mass\nm and short-range density-density interaction potential\nV (x)\nZ L\n1\nH = \u2212\ndx \u03a8\u2020 \u2202x2 \u03a8\n2m 0\nZ\nZ L\n1 L\n+\ndx\ndy V (x \u2212 y)n(x)n(y).\n(2)\n2 0\n0\nHere \u03a8 = (\u03c8\u2191 , \u03c8\u2193 ) is a two-component fermionic field\nand n(x) = \u03a8\u2020 (x)\u03a8(x) is the local charge density. At\nzero magnetic field, the number of electrons with spin\n\u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193 is N\u2191 = N\u2193 = N/2. The average density is\n\u03bd = N/L and the Fermi wavevector is kF = \u03c0\u03bd/2. We\nassume the interaction potential to have a finite range R,\ndue to screening by nearby gates. For simplicity, we will\ndiscuss the properties of A(q, \u03c9) in the thermodynamic\nlimit.\n\nThe spectral function A(q, \u03c9) in Eq. (1) satisfies the\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem\n2A(q, \u03c9) = (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c9/T )S(q, \u03c9),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere S(q, \u03c9) is the DCSF given by\nZ +\u221e\nZ L\ndt ei\u03c9t hn(x, t)n(0, 0)i. (4)\ndx e\u2212iqx\nS(q, \u03c9) =\n0\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nSince S(\u2212q, \u03c9) = S(q, \u03c9), hereafter we take q > 0. Since\nwe are interested in the regime T \u001c \u000fF , we shall start by\ndiscussing the DCSF at T = 0. The exact result for the\nnoninteracting case, V = 0, is\nS0 (q, \u03c9) = (2m/q) \u03b8(q 2 /2m \u2212 |\u03c9 \u2212 vF q|),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere vF = kF /m is the Fermi velocity. For V = 0,\nthe spectral weight vanishes outside the particle-hole\ncontinuum defined by the upper and lower thresholds\n\u03c9\u00b1 (q) = vF q \u00b1 q 2 /2m. As a function of energy \u03c9, the\nline shape of the DCSF in this case consists of one rectangular peak whose width is given by the band curvature\nscale \u03b4\u03c9(q) = q 2 /m.\nIt is important to note that for spin-1/2 fermions the\nDCSF at small q cannot be obtained by perturbation theory in the interaction. In fact, the first order correction\nto S(q, \u03c9) has logarithmic divergences at \u03c9 \u2248 \u03c9\u00b1 (q)\n\u03b4S(q, \u03c9)\nm(2\u1e7cq \u2212 \u1e7c0 )\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9\u2212\n\u2248\nln\n,\nS0 (q, vF q)\n\u03c0q\n\u03c9+ \u2212 \u03c9\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u1e7ck is the Fourier transform of V (x). These divergences signal edge singularities and are reminiscent\nof the result for spinless fermions,16 but there is an important difference. For spinless fermions, the prefactor of the logarithmic divergence is m(\u1e7c0 \u2212 \u1e7cq )/\u03c0q; for\nshort-range interactions, \u1e7c0 \u2212 \u1e7cq \u223c q 2 , it vanishes as\nq \u2192 0. In contrast, the prefactor in the spinful case,\nm(2\u1e7cq \u2212 \u1e7c0 )/\u03c0q \u2248 m\u1e7c0 /\u03c0q, diverges as q \u2192 0. The difference stems from the amplitude for s-wave scattering\nbetween electrons with opposite spin. This indicates that\nthe limits q \u2192 0 and \u1e7c0 \u2192 0 in S(q, \u03c9) do not commute.\nIn the limit q \u001c m\u1e7c0 , it is important to treat interactions exactly and account for the effects of spin-charge\nseparation, as we will discuss in the following sections.\nIII.\n\nEFFECTIVE MODEL FOR SPIN-CHARGE\nCOUPLING\n\nIn the regime q \u001c m\u1e7c0 , we can treat interactions exactly and regard band curvature as a perturbation, with\nq/kF playing the role of a small parameter.12,17,18 In the\nlinear dispersion approximation, bosonization1 of Hamiltonian (2) is standard and leads to the Luttinger model\nwith Hamiltonian density\n\u0001 2\u03c0vs 2\n\u0001\n2\nH` = 2\u03c0vc JR\n+ JL2 +\nJR + J2L \u2212 2\u03c0vs g JR * JL .\n3\n(7)\n\n\f3\nHere JR/L (JR/L ) are chiral U(1) charge (SU(2) spin)\ncurrents, vc (vs ) is the charge (spin) velocity, and g is\nthe bare coupling constant of the marginally irrelevant\nbackscattering operator.

This\nwill be discussed in the following subsection.\nA.\n\nRenormalization group flow with irrelevant\noperators\n\nAll the operators in Eq. (13) are irrelevant and have\nthe same scaling dimension x = 3. The renormalization\ngroup (RG) equations for the irrelevant coupling constants (including the marginal g in Eq. (7)) can be derived by integrating out high-energy modes in the partition function as one lowers the ultraviolet momentum\ncutoff \u039b. Following the notation of Ref. 19, we define\n\"dimensionless\" coupling constants (which have dimensions of velocity) \u03b7\u0303\u00b1 = \u039b\u03b7\u00b1 , \u03ba\u0303\u00b1 = \u039b\u03ba\u00b1 and \u03ba\u03033 = \u039b\u03ba3 .\n\n\f4\nTo obtain the quantum corrections to scaling, we use the\noperator product expansion (OPE) of the spin currents1\ni\u03b5abc\n\u03b4 ab\n+\n: JLc (0) :,\n2\n2\n8\u03c0 z\n2\u03c0z\n\u03b4 ab\ni\u03b5abc\na\nb\nc\n: JR\n(z\u0304) : : JR\n(0) : \u223c\n+\n: JR\n(0) :, (22)\n8\u03c0 2 z\u0304 2\n2\u03c0z\u0304\n: JLa (z) : : JLb (0) : \u223c\n\nwhere z = vs \u03c4 +ix and z\u0304 = vs \u03c4 \u2212ix, with \u03c4 the imaginary\ntime, and \u03b5abc is the Levi-Civita antisymmetric tensor.\n[The normal ordering symbol :: is implicit in the Hamiltonian Eqs.

This choice of\ncutoff is rotationally invariant for the spin modes, but\nelliptical for the charge modes. In order to get a nonzero\ncontribution to the RG equation after integrating out the\nshell in the (x, \u03c4 ) plane, it is important to contract both\nright and left movers for a given species (charge or spin)\nat the same time.\nIn the presence of the dimension-three operators, the\nvelocities, Luttinger parameter and chemical potential\nare renormalized, but flow to their fixed-point values in\nthe low-energy limit.

This will be important in Section IV D when\nwe compare leading logarithmic corrections to the DCSF\ndue to g and \u03ba3 .\nIV.\n\nDYNAMICAL CHARGE STRUCTURE\nFACTOR\n\nIn the bosonized form of Eq.

Within\nthe Luttinger model, the charge boson is free and we have\n0\n0\n0\n0\nCLL\n= CL , CRR\n= CR and CLR\n= CRL\n= 0, with\nCR/L (x, \u03c4 ) \u2261 hJR/L (x, \u03c4 )JR/L (0, 0)i\n1\n1\n.\n=\n8\u03c0 2 (vc \u03c4 \u2213 ix)2\n\n(34)\n\nTaking the Fourier transform, we obtain\nCR/L (q, i\u03c9) =\n\n1\n\u00b1q\n.\n4\u03c0 i\u03c9 \u2213 vc q\n\n(35)\n\nAs a result, the DCSF calculated in the linear dispersion\napproximation is given by\nS(q, \u03c9) = 2Kc q \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 vc q).\n\nThe solution is of the form\n\u03ba3 (`)/[g(`)]2 = const..\n\nwhere \u039b0 is the initial value of the cutoff. As a result,\nfor positive g \u001c 1 and for \u039b \u001c \u039b0 e\u22121/g the effective\ng(\u039b) vanishes logarithmically as g(\u039b) \u223c 1/ ln(\u039b0 /\u039b). If\nthe bare g at high energies is of order 1, the perturbative\nresult in Eq. (29) is still valid if g is interpreted as g(\u039b0 )\nat some scale \u039b0 \u001c kF such that g(\u039b0 ) \u001c 1. In any case,\nwe obtain g(\u039b) \u223c 1/ ln(\u039b0 /\u039b) in the low-energy limit.\nMore interestingly, Eq. (28) implies\n\n(36)\n\nThat the DCSF is given by a delta-function peak at\nthe energy of the free charge boson follows from spincharge separation and Lorentz invariance of the Luttinger\nmodel. This should be contrasted with the free-electron\nresult in Eq. (5), where the peak associated with particlehole excitations has a q 2 broadening due to the curvature\nof the dispersion about the Fermi points.\n\n\f5\nA.\n\na\nJR\n\nWidth of the charge peak\n\nWe can calculate S(q, \u03c9) beyond the Luttinger liquid\nresult by analyzing the effects of the boson-boson interactions in Eq. (13). First, let us consider the broadening of the charge peak. The charge-only \u03b7\u00b1 terms are\nfamiliar from the spinless case.12 They account for the\ndecay of one charge boson into two charge bosons. In\nparticular, \u03b7\u2212 is a three-leg vertex in which one right(left-) moving boson decays into two right-(left-)moving\nbosons, thus coupling the single-boson state to degenerate multi-boson states. It is known that perturbation theory in \u03b7\u2212 is badly divergent, but can be dealt\nwith by refermionization.7,11 Near the charge mass shell,\n\u03c9 \u2248 vc q, we introduce a spinless holon field \u03c8c,R such\n\u221a\n\u2020\nthat \u03c8c,R\n\u03c8c,R = 2JR . The \u03b7\u2212 term in Eq. (13) then\nmaps onto a parabolic dispersion about the holon Fermi\npoint\n\u03b7\u2212 \u2020 2\n4\u03c0 2\n3\n\u2202x \u03c8c,R .\n\u03b7\u2212 JR\n\u2192 \u2212 \u221a \u03c8c,R\n3\n2 2\n\n(37)\n\nIt can be argued that \u03b7\u2212 determines the exact broadening of the DCSF to order q 2 because it gives rise to\nthe bosonic diagrams that are most singular at \u03c9 =\nvc q.12 Within the approximation of neglecting the other\ndimension-three operators, the charge sector of the Luttinger model plus the \u03b7\u2212 term refermionizes into a\u221afree\nfermion model with dispersion \u000fc (k) \u2248 vc k+\u03b7\u2212 k 2 /(2 2),\nfor k measured from the right Fermi point. The support\nof the charge peak in the DCSF is then given by the spectrum of excitations with a single holon-anti-holon pair.\nDue to the curvature of the dispersion, these excitations\ndefine a continuum bounded by\n\u221a\n\u03c9c\u00b1 (q) = vc q \u00b1 \u03b7\u2212 q 2 /2 2.\n(38)\nTherefore, at order q 2 , the charge peak has a freefermion-like line shape\n\u221a\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2 2Kc\n\u03b7\u2212 q 2\n\u221a \u2212 |\u03c9 \u2212 vc q| .\nS(q, \u03c9) \u2248\n\u03b8\n(39)\n\u03b7\u2212 q\n2 2\n\u221a\nThe parameter 2/\u03b7\u2212 can be interpreted as a renormalized holon mass.\nIt is interesting that the limits q \u2192 0 and \u1e7c0 \u2192 0 in\nthe width do not commute. For q \u001c\nk\u221aF , we have\n\u221a m\u1e7c0 \u001c\n2\n2\nfrom\nEq.\n(14)\nthat\n\u03b4\u03c9\n(q)\n=\n\u03b7\nq\n/\n2\n\u2248\nq\n/(\n2m). The\nc\n\u2212\n\u221a\n2 factor makes the charge peak narrower than the free\nelectron result in Eq. (5).20 In particular, this means that\nin the regime q \u001c m\u1e7c0 the holon dispersion (which shows\nup, for instance, in the single-electron spectral function)\nshould not be regarded as a smooth continuation of the\nelectron dispersion. An important crossover happens at\nq \u223c m\u1e7c0 .\nThe result in Eq. (38) can be directly compared with\nthe exact width of the two-holon continuum for an integrable model, such as the Yang-Gaudin model.21 We\n\nJR\n\n\u03ba\u2212\n\na\nJR\n\nJL\n\n\u03ba+\n\na\nJR\n\na\nJR\n\nFigure 1: Decay of a charge boson (propagators denoted by\nwiggly lines) into two right-moving spin bosons (propagators\ndenoted by straight lines).

We verified that the width\ndefined as the difference between the maximum and minimum exact energies of a particle-hole excitation in the\nholon Fermi sea for momentum q \u001c\u221am(vc \u2212 vs ) agrees\nwith Eq. (38), including the factor of 2 and with \u03b7\u2212 calculated from the phenomenological relation in Eq. (14).\nCorrections to Eq. (39) due to residual holon-holon interactions are higher order in q. These corrections include\n2\n, analogous to the spina high frequency tail at order \u03b7+\nless case,10,12,18 and possible asymmetries of the charge\npeak near the edges of the two-holon continuum, due to\nx-ray edge type singularities.16 But before we discuss the\nbehavior near \u03c9c\u00b1 (q), we turn to the contributions from\nthe spin operators in Eq. (13).\nB.\n\nSpin peak\n\nThe \u03ba\u00b1 operators in Eq. (13) allow for decay of the\ncharge boson into two spin bosons moving in the same\ndirection and carrying the total energy \u03c9 \u2248 vs q. The\ncorresponding three-leg vertices are illustrated in Fig. 1.\nAs noted in Ref. 18, this process gives rise to a narrow\npeak in the DCSF centered at \u03c9 = vs q which corresponds\nto a charge-carrying spin singlet excitation. Let us calculate the correction to the charge boson propagator in\nEq. (33) using second order perturbation theory in \u03ba\u00b1 .\nFor instance, the O(\u03ba2\u2212 ) correction to CRR is\n\u03ba\n\n\u2212\n\u03b4CRR\n(q, i\u03c9) = 32\u03c0 4 \u03ba2\u2212 [CR (q, i\u03c9)]2 \u03a0RR (q, i\u03c9),\n\n(40)\n\nz\nwhere we made use of the identity : J2R/L := 3(JR/L\n)2\nand introduced the boson self-energy\nZ\n\u03a0\u03b1\u03b2 (q, i\u03c9) = \u2212 dx e\u2212iqx\n\n\u00d7\n\nZ\n\n\u03b2\n\nd\u03c4 ei\u03c9\u03c4 S\u03b1 (x, \u03c4 )S\u03b2 (x, \u03c4 ).

(45) is\nbroadened by treating band curvature operators to higher\norders. We first note that the condition q \u001c m(vc \u2212 vs )\nensures that the spin peak is well separated from the\ncharge peak. By analogy with the discussion in Sec.\nIV A, we expect that the width of the spin peak is set\nby decay processes that couple degenerate states with\nmultiple spin bosons propagating in the same direction.\nHowever, in contrast with the case of the charge peak,\nin Eq. (13) there is no dimension-three spin-only chiral\noperator that would be equivalent to a parabolic dispersion about spinon Fermi points. Thus the broadening of\nthe spin peak must come from higher-order on-shell decay processes. In fact, the leading irrelevant spin-boson\ninteractions allowed by symmetry are quartic in the spin\ncurrents\n\u03b6\u2212 (J2R/L )2 , \u03b6+ J2R J2L , \u03bb1 (JR * JL )2 , \u03bb2 JR * JL (J2R + J2L ).\n(47)\nIn principle, these operators are present as perturbations\nto model (7) plus (13). They are also generated by \"projecting\" into a subspace with energy |\u03c9\u2212vs q| \u001c (vc \u2212vs )q\nand integrating out \"high-energy\" charge bosons. The\nspin part of the resulting model for \u03c9 \u2248 vs q is equivalent\nto the low-energy effective model for the XXZ spin chain\nat zero magnetic field.22\nPerturbation theory in the dimension-four operators in\nEq. (47) is highly singular for \u03c9 \u2248 vs q.12 Unfortunately,\nit is not known how to sum up the expansion in this case.\nRefermionization does not solve the problem because the\neffective fermionic model with dimension-four operators\ncontains not only band curvature terms, like \u03c8 \u2020 \u2202x3 \u03c8 , but\nalso intrabranch (i.e. which do not mix R and L) residual interactions of the form \u03c8 \u2020 \u2202x \u03c8 \u2202x \u03c8 \u2020 \u03c8, which also\n\ncontribute to the broadening at leading order in q. Nevertheless, simple power counting tells us that the width\nof the spin peak should scale like \u03b4\u03c9s (q) \u223c O(q 3 ), rather\nthan O(q 2 ). This is consistent with the result for the\nDSSF of the XXZ model at zero field,12 where it is known\nthat the spectral weight is dominated by two-spinon excitations and the exact spinon dispersion takes the form\n\u000fs (k) = vs sin(k) \u2248 vs (k \u2212 k 3 /6 + . . . ) about the spinon\nFermi points.\nC.\n\nEdge singularities of the spin peak\n\nTo be able to say more about the line shape of the\nspin peak, we refermionize the spin currents into interacting spinless fermions. This is equivalent to inverting\nthe Jordan-Wigner transformation in the continuum and\nwriting down a SU(2) symmetric model for the fermions\nassociated with the spin excitations. In other words, the\nidea is analogous to deriving the bosonic Hamiltonian\nfor the Heisenberg spin chain by starting from the XXZ\nmodel and tuning the Luttinger parameter to the SU(2)\nsymmetric value (a strongly interacting limit with Luttinger parameter K = 1/2), as opposed to deriving the\nbosonic Hamiltonian directly from the Hubbard model\n(in which case the spin bosons come out noninteracting\nwith Ks = 1).1,23 The new ingredient here is that the\nspin excitations are coupled to gapless charge modes.\nThe mapping of the bare chiral fermion densities to\n\u2020\nz\nthe spin currents in Eq. (7) is \u03c8s,R/L\n\u03c8s,R/L = (3JR/L\n\u2212\nz\nJL/R )/2, as follows from a canonical transformation for\nthe spin bosonic fields. Spin inversion symmetry implies\nthat the dispersion of these fermionic spinons is particlehole symmetric. We assume that the exact dispersion\nabout the right Fermi point is given by\n\u000fs (k) \u2248 vs k \u2212 \u03b3k 3 ,\n\n(48)\n\nwith the unknown parameter \u03b3 > 0. We expect that\n\u03b3 stems from dimension-four operators in the bosonic\nmodel and is of order 1/(mkF ).\nIn terms of fermions, the operator J2R that gives rise to\nthe spin peak in Eq. (45) creates particle-hole pairs on\nthe spinon Fermi sea. We can study the behavior near\nthe edges of multi-spinon continua using the methods of\nRefs. 16,24. The absolute lower threshold \u03c9s\u2212 (q) = \u000fs (q)\nis defined by an excitation with a particle at the Fermi\nsurface and a hole at momentum \u2212q below the Fermi\npoint. For \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9s\u2212 (q) \u001c \u03b3q 3 , we define a \"deep spinon\"\nsubband by expanding16\n\u03c8sR \u223c \u03c8sr + e\u2212iqx d\u2020s ,\n\n(49)\n\n\u2020\nwhere \u03c8sr\ncreates low-energy spinons near the right Fermi\npoint and d\u2020s creates a hole at momentum \u2212q below the\nFermi point. This leads to the quantum impurity model\n\nHs\u2212 = H` + d\u2020s (\u03c9s\u2212 \u2212 iu\u2202x )ds \u2212 (Vr Jrz + Vl Jlz )d\u2020s ds\n+2\u03c0q(\u03ba0\u2212 Jr + \u03ba0+ Jl )d\u2020s ds ,\n(50)\n\n\f7\nwhere u \u2248 vs \u2212 3\u03b3q 2 is the velocity of the ds hole. The\nspin-only part of the quantum impurity model given by\nthe first line in Eq. (50) is derived as explained in Ref. 24,\nby applying the mode expansion (49) to a generic model\nof interacting spinless fermions with the dispersion in Eq.\n(48). The second line stems from the coupling of the energy density of the spinon field to the bosonized holon\ndensity. Here Jr/l stand for the bosonized charge currents with cutoff at energy scale \u001c \u03b3q 3 , which allows the\n\"high-energy\" spinon to emit low-energy charge bosons\nsuch that the energy remains near \u03c9 = \u03c9s\u2212 (q). Note\nthat in this procedure we keep only marginal operators\nin the quantum impurity model, as irrelevant operators\ncan only introduce subleading power-law singularities at\nthe threshold. This is not to be confused with the presence of irrelevant operators in the original bosonic model\n(13), which are essential to argue for the nonlinearity of\nholon and spinon dispersions and for the very existence\nof the deep spinon threshold.\nRather than keep track of the parameters in the derivation of model (50), it is more useful to introduce the\nmodel phenomenologically (it contains all the marginal\noperators allowed by symmetry) and to fix the coupling\nconstants by symmetry and phenomenological relations.\nThe parameters Vr/l can be fixed by realizing that the\nsame model (50) can be used to calculate the lower\nedge singularity of the DSSF. This is because the opz\nerator JR/L\nthat enters the longitudinal spin-spin correlation function also creates two-spinon excitations in the\nfermionic representation, and the lower threshold of the\nsupport of the DSSF is also given by the deep spinon\nexcitation. The important constraint comes from SU(2)\nsymmetry, which imposes that the exponents for the longitudinal and transverse DSSF must coincide.25 We reproduce this argument in detail in the appendix.\nThe coupling constants \u03ba0\u00b1 in Eq. (50) are related\nto exact phase shifts at the holon Fermi points due to\nthe creation of a high-energy spinon. We want to show\nthat at small q these are also related to the band curvature parameters in Eq. (13). It is easy to show that an\ninfinitesimal change in the chemical potential \u03b4\u03bc gives\nrise to a shift\n\u221a in the energy of the high energy spinon\n\u03b4\u03c9s\u2212 = \u03b4\u03bc Kc (\u03ba0\u2212 + \u03ba0+ )q/vc . This allows us to write\n\u03ba0\u2212\n\n+\n\n\u03ba0+\n\nvc \u2202\u03c9s\u2212\n=\u221a\n.\nKc q \u2202\u03bc\n\n(51)\n\nBut from the exact spinon dispersion we have \u03c9s\u2212 =\nvs q + O(q 3 ), hence\nvc \u2202vs\n\u03ba0\u2212 + \u03ba0+ = \u221a\n+ O(q 2 ).\nKc \u2202\u03bc\n\n(52)\n\nThe second relation for \u03ba0\u2212 \u2212 \u03ba0+ can be obtained by imposing Galilean invariance to Hamiltonian (50). Similarly to the discussion in Section III, we compare momentum and current operators. The contribution from\nthe spin-charge coupling terms in Eq. (50) to the current density (defined from the continuity equation for\n\nthe charge density) is\nJd =\n\np\nKc q(\u03ba0\u2212 \u2212 \u03ba0+ )d\u2020s ds .\n\n(53)\n\nTherefore, if we consider an excited state in which we\ncreate a particle-hole pair of spinons with a deep hole\nat momentum k\u221a\nF \u2212 q and a particle at kF , the current\nof this state is Kc q(\u03ba0\u2212 \u2212 \u03ba0+ ). Demanding that this\ncurrent be equal to the momentum q of the state divided\nby the mass m, we find\np\n\u03ba0\u2212 \u2212 \u03ba0+ = 1/( Kc m).\n(54)\nComparing Eqs. (52) and (54) with (17) and (20), we\nconclude that\n\u03ba0\u00b1 = \u03ba\u00b1 + O(q 2 ).\n\n(55)\n\nUsing model (50) and Eq. (55), we can show (see appendix) that the DCSF diverges at the lower edge of the\ntwo-spinon continuum as S(q, \u03c9) \u223c (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9s\u2212 )\u03bcs\u2212 , with\nexponent\n2\n2\n\u03bcs\u2212 = \u22121/2 + (\u03b1\u2212\n+ \u03b1+\n)q 2 /2 + O(q 4 ),\n\n(56)\n\nwhere \u03b1\u00b1 is defined in Eq. (46). Therefore, as q \u2192 0, the\nexponent approaches the universal value \u22121/2, which depends only on SU(2) symmetry. The q 2 correction to \u03bcs\u2212\nis due to the coupling to gapless charge bosons with energy \u001c \u03b3q 3 . This exponent should be contrasted with the\nsquare-root singularity of the DSSF for the Heisenberg\nmodel.26 We note that \u03bcs\u2212 differs from the corresponding exponent for SU(2) bosons at the magnon threshold,\n\u03bcm = \u22121 + O(q 2 ).27,28\nThe upper edge of the two-spinon continuum is given\nby \u03c9s+ (q) = 2\u000fs (q/2). As discussed in Ref. 24, near\nthis edge the spectral weight is suppressed by resonant\nscattering between spinons with equal velocity. If most of\nthe spectral weight of the spin peak is due to two-spinon\nexcitations, the width can be defined as\n\u03b4\u03c9s (q) = \u03c9s+ (q) \u2212 \u03c9s\u2212 (q) = 3\u03b3q 3 /4.\n\n(57)\n\nWhile the upper threshold of two-spinon continuum in\nthe integrable XXZ model exhibits a square-root cusp,\nhere we expect that the upper threshold of the two-spinon\ncontinuum is rounded by higher order (in q) processes, at\nleast for non-integrable models.\n\nD.\n\nSmearing of the charge peak: decay rate of the\ncharge boson\n\nIn general, we expect S(q, \u03c9) to have nonzero spectral\nweight anywhere above the lower threshold \u03c9s\u2212 (q). A\ntail between the spin and charge peaks is generated due\nto the decay of the charge boson into a pair of L and R\nspin bosons, as depicted in Fig. 2.

To first order\nin \u03ba\u00b1 , \u03ba3 (leading order in q/kF in the contribution to\nS(q, \u03c9)), there are two contributions to the effective vertex, one from \u03ba3 and the other from a combination of \u03ba\u00b1\nand g.

IV A is inside a continuum of spin excitations. The coupling to the continuum results in a decay\nrate for the charge excitations.

III A). Within RG improved\n\n1\n3[g(q)]2 \u03c0(\u03ba\u2212 + \u03ba+ )2 (vc2 \u2212 vs2 )q 3\n=\n.\n\u03c4c\n256vs3\n\n(68)\n\nFor q \u001c m(vc \u2212 vs ), the decay rate in Eq. (68) is smaller\nthan \u03b4\u03c9c (q) \u223c q 2 , which is due to decay of the charge\nboson within the charge sector (see Sec. IV A). However,\n\u03c4c\u22121 is important because it is responsible for rounding off\nthe edges of the charge peak. This can be confirmed by\ncalculating the decay rate for a single high-energy holon \u2013\na dc particle in the quantum impurity model for the edges\nof the two-holon continuum, similar to the calculation in\nRef. 30 for the spinless case.. The decay rate is due to\nthe perturbation\n\u03b4H3 \u223c \u03be3 d\u2020c dc \u2202x \u03c6sR \u2202x \u03c6sL .\n\n(69)\n\nThe parameter \u03be3 gives the amplitude for a process in\nwhich a holon scatters off two spinons moving in opposite\ndirection. This is not a three-electron scattering process\nand in principle \u03be3 6= 0 even for integrable models. Using\nthe result in Eq. (5.8) of Ref. 30, we obtain\n1\n(\u03be3 )2 (vc2 \u2212 vs2 )[\u039b(q)]3\n\u221d\n,\n\u03c4c\nvc3\n\n(70)\n\n\f9\nwhere \u039b(q) is the cutoff of the high-energy subband. Setting \u039b(q) \u223c q, we recover the momentum and interaction\ndependence of the decay rate in Eq. (68) if we assume\nthat \u03be3 does not vanish as a power law of q in the limit\nq \u2192 0. From comparison with Eq. (67), we expect\n\u03be3 \u221d \u03baeff\n3 . This should be contrasted with the spinless\ncase, where the coupling constant in Eq. (5.13) of Ref.\n[30] has to vanish like q 2 because of statistics, since there\nis no s-wave scattering for spinless fermions. For the\nspinful case, statistics alone does not imply that the amplitude \u03be3 vanishes as q 2 or high powers of q.\nNote also that the result for 1/\u03c4c in Eq. (68) is nonperturbative in the electron-electron interaction, since for\nq \u001c m\u1e7c0 \u001c kF , we have \u03c4c\u22121 \u223c g 2 \u1e7c0 q 3 /kF2 , which is third\norder in the interaction strength. Furthermore, this result implies that, even for an integrable model, the powerlaw singularities16 at \u03c9c\u00b1 are removed at order q 3 . The\nsame decay rate 1/\u03c4c rounds off the singularity at the\nholon mass shell in the electron spectral function.31 This\nis remarkably different from the spinless case, where it is\nbelieved that integrable models can have exact singularities above the lower threshold because the decay rate of\na high-energy particle may vanish exactly.30\nWe note that if the phenomenological relations\nEqs. (17) and (21) are valid for the running coupling\nconstants and we substitute them in Eq. (59), we\n\u22121/2\n\u2202g/\u2202\u03bc.29 At low energies,\nfind \u03baeff\n3 = \u2212(3/2)vc vs Kc\ng(\u039b) \u223c g(\u039b0 )/[1+g(\u039b0 ) ln(\u039b0 /\u039b)]. It is not clear how imposing the phenomenological relations at all energy scales\ncan be reconciled with the result from the RG. It is important for our results in Eqs. (65) and (68) that even\nif \u2202g/\u2202\u03bc = 0 at some energy scale, the effective vertex\n\u03baeff\n3 will be generated by the RG flow because \u03ba3 and g\nscale differently, and the leading logarithmic dependence\nis due to the g term in Eq. (59).\nFinally, putting together all the pieces, we construct\nthe final picture for the DCSF at zero temperature in\nFig. 3. Note, in particular, that there is only a rounded\nthreshold at \u03c9 \u2248 \u03c9c\u2212 .\nE.\n\nFinite temperature effects\n\nWe now discuss the effects of finite temperature on the\nbroadening of the charge and spin peaks in the DCSF.\nThis will be important to compute the temperature dependence of the drag resistivity in Eq. (1).\nWe consider the regime where both temperature and\nband curvature energy scale are small compared to the\nscale of spin charge separation: T \u001c (vc \u2212 vs )vc /\u03b7\u2212 and\nq \u001c (vc \u2212 vs )/\u03b7\u2212 . Assuming that vc , vs , and vc \u2212 vs are\nall of the order of vF and 1/\u03b7\u2212 is of the order of m, these\nconditions mean roughly T \u001c TF = mvF2 /2 and q \u001c kF .\nThis is the regime in which we may expect the spin and\ncharge peaks to remain well separated. Neglecting the\noverlap between the spin and charge peaks, the line shape\nof the charge peak can be approximated by the finite\ntemperature result for the imaginary part of the density-\n\nS(q, \u03c9)\n\n\u03c9\n\u03c9c+\n\u03c9s+\n\n\u03c9c\u2212\n\n\u03c9s\u2212\n\n\u223c (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9s\u2212 )\u03bcs\u2212\n\nq\n\n\u03c9s\u2212 \u03c9s+\n\n\u03c9c\u2212\n\n\u03c9c+\n\n\u03c9\n\nFigure 3: (Color online) Schematic excitation spectrum (inset\non the upper right corner) and line shape (main figure) for the\nDCSF of spin-1/2 fermions at small q. The dashed lines in the\n(q, \u03c9) plane represent the linear dispersion of charge and spin\nmodes in the Luttinger model. The two-holon and two-spinon\ncontinua are represented by blue and yellow regions bounded\nby \u03c9c\u00b1 (q) and \u03c9s\u00b1 (q), respectively. At zero temperature and\nin the regime q \u001c m(vc \u2212 vs ), the line shape of S(q, \u03c9) (solid\nred line in the main figure) has well defined peaks inside the\ntwo-holon and two-spinon continua.

The width of the\ncharge peak at finite temperature is then of the order\nof max{\u03b7\u2212 q 2 , \u03b7\u2212 qT /vc }.\nThe calculation of the width of the spin peak is more\ncomplicated because we do not have an approximation in\nterms of noninteracting spinless fermions. For the purpose of calculating the drag resistivity in Eq. (1), we are\nonly interested in whether for fixed small q and at low\ntemperature the spin peak can become broader than the\ncharge peak. On the one hand, the broadening due solely\nto band curvature must be of order (\u03b3q 2 /vs )T . As long\nas q, T /vs \u001c m(vc \u2212 vs ), \u03b7\u2212 /\u03b3, this is small compared\nto the broadening of charge peak. On the other hand,\nthermal effects have a stronger effect on spin excitations\nbecause the latter are damped by diffusion.32,33\nRecall that the spin peak stems from the self-energy\nwith two spin bosons propagating in the same direction\n(see Fig. 1). We can calculate the finite temperature\nbroadening by neglecting band curvature operators and\napplying perturbation theory in the marginally irrelevant\noperator g in Eq. (7). As we did in section IV D, we neglect the \u03ba3 vertex in the leading logarithmic approximation. To order (\u03ba\u00b1 g)2 , there are two types of diagrams\nin the self-energy for the charge boson, as illustrated in\n\n\f10\nFig. 4. The first type amounts to a self-energy correction to the spin boson propagator. The transverse part\n\u2212\nof the perturbation, \u2212\u03c0vs g(JL+ JR\n+ h.c.) gives rise to a\nnonzero imaginary part of the retarded self-energy, which\ncan be calculated following Ref. 34.

(1). Here\nwe restore the index i = 1, 2 for properties of the drive\nwire and drag wire, respectively. Note that Eq. (1) is\nsymmetric under the exchange of drive and drag wires.\nWe may then assume vc1 \u2264 vc2 . We envision an experiment in which the electron density of the drag wire is\nvaried while the one in the drive wire is kept fixed. In\nprinciple, this could be achieved with vertically coupled\nwires whose densities are tuned independently by top and\nback gates. We can think that the sharply peaked DCSF\nof the drive wire is the reference for integrating Eq. (1)\nin the (q, \u03c9) plane, and approximate\nZ \u221e\nU2\nq2\nr \u2248\ndq\n4\u03c0 3 \u03bd1 \u03bd2 T 0\nsinh2 (vc1 q/2T )\nZ \u221e\n\u00d7\nd\u03c9 A1 (q, \u03c9)A2 (q, \u03c9).\n(77)\n0\n\nClearly, the forward scattering contribution to the drag\nresistivity is maximum for ideal density matching, vc1 =\nvc2 ,35 in which case it is dominated by the overlap of\nthe charge peaks of the two wires over modes with \u03c9 \u2248\nvci q \u223c T \u001c TF . The temperature dependence in this\ncase is the same as for spinless fermions,10 r \u223c T 2 for\n2\n2\n\u2212 vc2\n| \u001c T \u001c TF . Also like the result for spinless\nm|vc1\nfermions, a much weaker response, r \u223c T 5 , is obtained for\n2\n2\n|,\n\u2212vc2\ngeneral density mismatch in the regime T \u001c m|vc1\nfrom the overlap of the charge peak for one wire with the\ntails of the DCSF for the other wire.\nThe new effect due to the spin degree of freedom is\nrelated to the presence of a spin peak in the DCSF illustrated in Fig. 3. It suggests that the drag resistivity\ncan be enhanced when the electron densities in the wires\nare rather different but the charge peak of one wire overlaps with the spin peak of the other wire. This happens\nover an extended region in the (q, \u03c9) plane if vc1 \u2248 vs2 .\nThe interpretation is that under this condition holons in\nwire 1 can efficiently scatter off spinons in wire 2, which\nin their turn transfer momentum to holons in the same\nwire.\n\n\f11\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 T 5 ln2\nr\u223c\n\uf8f3 T 4,\n\nq\n3\nT \u001c g2 (T ) (v\u03b3s22) , [g2 (T )]2 TF\nq\n3\ng2 (v\u03b3s22) \u001c T \u001c mvc1 (vc2 \u2212 vc1 ).\n(78)\nNotice that in the low temperature limit diffusion suppresses the drag by making the spin peak broader than\nthe charge peak. Nevertheless, even in the spin diffusion\nregime the smallness of g2 (T ) \u223c 1/ ln(TF /T ) makes the\ndrag larger than the background contribution from the\ntails of the DCSF, which scales like r \u223c T 5 , as discussed\nabove.\nIn order to compute the expression in Eq. (77), we\nhave used the same strength of the electron-electron interaction \u1e7c0 and \u1e7c2kF for both wires. We estimated\nthe parameters of the DCSF in each wire using the phenomenological relations in section III, expanding to first\norder in the interaction. The finite temperature Ai (q, \u03c9)\nare approximated by the sum of a dominant charge peak\ngiven by Eq. (71) and a smaller spin peak given by the\nLorentzian in Eq. (75). For modes with q \u223c T /vc1 that\ncontribute to the integral in Eq. (77) but are not in\nthe regime \u03b3q 3 \u001c 1/\u03c4s (T ), the Lorentzian is not a good\napproximation for the line shape of the spin peak (which\nmust become asymmetric with a peak near the lower edge\nof the two spinon spectrum). However, the drag resistivity is not sensitive to the detailed line shape since in this\nregime the spin peak is much narrower than the charge\npeak for the same q and what matters most is whether\nthe spin peak for the drag wire falls inside the charge\npeak for the drive wire.\nFig. 5 illustrates the dependence of the drag resisTF\nT\n\n,\n\n0.05\n0.04\n\nr(vs2 )/r0\n\nLet us discuss the temperature dependence of the drag\nresistivity when vc1 = vs2 . We are interested in the\nregime T \u001c mvc1 (vc2 \u2212 vc1 ), where spin charge separation may be measurable. According to the result in\nsection IV E, the spin peak \u03b4A(q, \u03c9, T ) for values of q\nthat scale linearly with T assume a Lorentzian line shape\n3\nat low temperatures such that T /g2 (T ) \u001c (vs2\n/\u03b32 )1/2 .\nThe width of the charge peak for wire 1 for q \u223c T /vs2\nis of order \u03b7\u2212,1 T 2 /vs2 vc1 . If the temperature is also\nlow enough that T /[g2 (T )]2 \u001c vc1 vs2 /\u03b7\u2212,1 \u223c TF , the\nspin peak for wire 2 is broader than the charge peak\nfor wire 1. Using Eq. (71) for wire 1 and Eq. (75)\nfor wire 2, we find that in this regime the drag resistivity in Eq. (77) scales like r \u223c T 5 /[g2 (T )]2 . However,\nif the value of g2 (T ) is small even at intermediate temperatures, there will be in general a temperature regime\n3\ng2 (vs2\n/\u03b32 )1/2 \u001c T \u001c mvc1 (vc2 \u2212 vc1 ) where diffusion is\nnot effective, in the sense that for q \u223c T /vs2 the broadening of the spin peak due to diffusion is smaller than the\none due to band curvature. In this case, the spin peak\nfor wire 2 is narrower than the charge peak for wire 1\nfor the same value of q \u001c kF i . Therefore, the integral in\nEq. (77) can be evaluated by considering that the entire\nspectral weight of the spin peak is inside the charge peak.\nIn this regime, the drag resistivity in Eq. (77) scales like\nr \u223c T 4 .

In this graph\nwe set \u1e7c0 /(\u03c0vF 1 ) = 0.4 and \u1e7c2kF /(\u03c0vF 1 ) = 0.1 in the\nweak coupling expressions for vci , vsi , Kci , \u03b7\u2212i , \u03ba\u00b1i for\nwires i = 1, 2, using equations in section III. The value of\nr(vs2 ) is normalized by the value at zero density mismatch,\nr0 = r(vs2 = vs1 ), for each temperature. Notice the peak in\nr when the spin velocity of the drag wire matches the charge\nvelocity of the drive wire, vs2 \u2248 vc1 .\n\ntivity on the density mismatch between the two wires,\nparametrized by the ratio vs2 /vc1 . The effect of spinonassisted Coulomb drag is observed as a small peak in\nthe drag resistivity when the wire densities are such that\nvs2 \u2248 vc1 . The height of the peak relative to the dominant response at zero density mismatch (vs2 \u2248 vs1 ) increases with increasing temperature. This is because, as\ntemperature increases, modes with larger q, for which\nthe spin peak in the DCSF have relatively larger spectral\nweight, start to contribute to the integral in Eq. (77). On\nthe other hand, increasing temperature also broadens the\ndominant peak observed at vs2 \u2248 vs1 , which eventually\nobscures the smaller peak at vs2 \u2248 vc1 . Therefore, it\nseems that the contribution of spinons to Coulomb drag\nwould most likely be observed as a shoulder in the density dependence of the drag resistivity at intermediate\ntemperatures.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have studied the dynamic charge response for spin1/2 fermions in one dimension beyond the usual linear\ndispersion approximation of Luttinger liquid theory. Unlike the spinless case, the limits of small momentum q and\nweak electron-electron interactions \u1e7c0 do not commute.\nThis is due to the interplay of spin charge separation\nand band curvature effects. The problem of calculating\nthe dynamical charge structure factor for electrons with\nmass m in the regime q \u001c m\u1e7c0 cannot be approached by\nperturbation theory in the electron-electron interactions.\n\n\f12\nWe have used a bosonized Hamiltonian and discussed the\neffects of irrelevant perturbations associated with band\ncurvature. We determined phenomenological relations\nfor the coupling constants of these perturbations, including the ones that couple charge and spin dynamics. The\nrenormalization group equations for the irrelevant operator denoted by \u03ba3 , which couples charge and spin and\nmixes right and left-moving spin modes, shows that its\neffective coupling constant has a nontrivial logarithmic\nscaling in the low energy limit.\nBased on a picture in which collective charge and spin\nmodes can be refermionized into spinless fermions (holons\nand spinons, respectively) with nonlinear dispersion, we\npresented an approximate line shape for the dynamic\ncharge structure factor valid in the long wavelength limit.\nAs a function of frequency, the dynamic charge structure factor has a dominant charge peak associated with\ntwo-holon excitations, whose width scales like q 2 . However, the spectral weight extends down to a lower threshold described as a two-spinon excitation. We calculated\nthe exponent of the power-law singularity at this lower\nthreshold and found that in the limit q \u2192 0 it converges\nto the universal value \u03bcs\u2212 = \u22121/2 + O(q 2 ), which depends only on spin SU(2) symmetry. We expect that the\nspectral weight near this lower threshold is largest within\na two-spinon continuum, giving rise to a spin peak in the\ncharge structure factor. There is also a tail of the spin\npeak above the two-spinon continuum. The coupling between spin and charge in the vicinity of the charge mass\nshell gives rise to a decay rate for the holon at order q 3 .\nThis decay rate is responsible for rounding off singularities at intermediate thresholds such as the edges of the\ntwo-holon continuum, regardless of the integrability of\nthe model.\nAt finite temperature, an important difference between\ncharge and spin excitations is that the latter are damped\nby diffusion. In the dynamic charge structure factor this\neffect is manifest in the Lorentzian broadening of the spin\npeak in the regime where the spin current decay rate is\nlarge compared to the band curvature energy scale for\nthe spinons.\nThese results allowed us to calculate the Coulomb drag\nresponse between two quantum wires, taking into account\nthe spin degree of freedom. In comparison with the result for spinless fermions studied in Ref. 10, there is an\nadditional effect (spinon-assisted Coulomb drag) due to\nspin-charge coupling: at low temperatures the drag resistivity as a function of density mismatch has a peak when\nthe charge velocity of one wire matches the spin velocity\nof the other. The temperature dependence of this drag\npeak has signatures of spin diffusion.\nNote: After this work had been submitted, Ref. 36\nappeared with related results for the exponent of edge\nsingularities at arbitrary momenta.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe acknowledge helpful discussions with J.

Humboldt Foundation (E.S.).\nAppendix A: Calculation of the lower edge exponent\n\nWe provide details for the calculation of the exponent of the power law singularity in the DCSF at \u03c9 =\n\u03c9s\u2212 (q) at zero temperature. While the asymptotic value\n\u03bcs\u2212 (q \u2192 0) = \u22121/2 is universal and depends only on\nSU(2) symmetry, following the argument of Ref. 25, we\nalso obtain the q 2 correction due to spin-charge coupling.\nAs mentioned in Sec. IV C, the lower edge of the spectrum is the same for the DCSF and for the DSSFs, defined\nas\nZ L\nZ +\u221e\nS ab (q, \u03c9) =\ndx e\u2212iqx\ndt ei\u03c9t hS a (x, t)S b (0, 0)i.\n0\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(A1)\nHere S(x) = \u03a8\u2020 (x) \u03c42 \u03a8(x), with \u03c4 the vector of Pauli matrices, is the spin density operator. Its long wavelength\ncomponents are represented by S = JL + JR . For fixed\nq, the lower threshold below which the DSSFs (both longitudinal and transverse) vanish is controlled by a deep\nspinon excitation with energy \u03c9s\u2212 (q) = \u000fs (q).\nThe components of S satisfy SU(2) commutation relation\n[S a (x), S b (x0 )] = i\u03b5abc S c (x)\u03b4(x \u2212 x0 ).\n\n(A2)\n\nWe will refermionize the spin density to spinless fermions.\nThis can be done using an inverse Jordan-Wigner transformation in the continuum\nS z (x) = \u03a8\u2020s (x)\u03a8s (x) + const.,\n+\n\nS (x) =\n\n\u03a8\u2020s (x) ei\u03c0\n\nR\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndx0 \u03b8(x\u2212x0 )S z (x0 )\n\n(A3)\n,\n\n(A4)\n\nwhere \u03a8s is a spinless fermionic spinon field, which obeys\nanticommutation relations {\u03a8s (x), \u03a8\u2020s (x0 )} = \u03b4(x \u2212 x0 ),\nand \u03b8(x) is the left-continuous Heaviside step function\nwith \u03b8(0) = 0.\nA generic spin Hamiltonian that is a function of the\nlocal spin density and respects SU(2) symmetry takes\nthe form\nHs = C1 S * S + C2 \u2202x S * \u2202x S + . . . ,\n\n(A5)\n\nwhere . . . stands for higher-order irrelevant operators.\nBy means of Eqs. (A3) and (A4), this maps onto a model\nof interacting spinons. The precise form of the spinon\nHamiltonian is not essential here, but it must be such\nthat in the low energy limit it yields the same equal-time\ncorrelation functions as the spin part of the Luttinger\nmodel (7). This is directly accomplished if model (7)\n\n\f13\nis recovered by bosonization of \u03a8s , analogously to the\nbosonization of the XXZ model.23 In this approach, the\nSU(2) symmetric model corresponds to strong interactions between spinons. Here we assume that the effective\nmodel for the spinons in the metallic case can be approached in the same way as the effective model for the\nHeisenberg spin chain, namely by starting from a generalized model of weakly interacting spinless fermions where\nwe can expand the dispersion about the Fermi points to\nbosonize the low-energy degrees of freedom. SU(2) symmetry is only imposed at the end, on the results for the\nspin-spin correlation functions, to fix the parameters of\nthe effective model. (It is conceivable that the strength\nof the spinon-spinon interaction could be tuned in a microscopic model for a metal with spin U(1) symmetry\nand that such weakly interacting limit could be realized.)\nIn addition to the interactions in the effective spinon\nmodel, we must account for the coupling to gapless charge\nmodes. For the purpose of deriving the exponent at the\nspinon edge, the latter can be described by bosonic fields\n\u03c6cR/L at all steps and need not be refermionized. The\nspin-charge coupling is then equivalent to spin-phonon\ncoupling in spin chains.\nLet us consider that in the ground state the spinons\nform a Fermi sea with a particle-hole symmetric band\n(due to spin inversion symmetry S z \u2192 \u2212S z ). The elementary S z = 0 excitations are particle-hole pairs in the\nspinon Fermi sea. Similarly, there are particle-hole excitations in the holon Fermi sea, but in our low-energy\neffective model for the lower edge these are treated as\ncharge bosons (since we can neglect band curvature for\nthe holons). This picture is supported by the Bethe\nansatz solution of the Yang-Gaudin or Hubbard models.\nWe assume that we can start from a model of noninteract(0)\n(0)\ning spinons with dispersion \u000fs,R/L (k) \u2248 \u00b1(vs k\u2212\u03b3 (0) k 3 +\n. . . ) about the Fermi points \u00b1kF . That the spinon Fermi\nwave vector is given by kF s = kF follows from the periodicity of the spin excitation spectrum, which is gapless\nat momentum 2kF .28 Another interpretation is that in\nthis approach the number of spinons,\nZ\n0\n\nL\n\ndx \u03a8\u2020s (x)\u03a8s (x) = kF s L/\u03c0 = N/2,\n\n(A6)\n\nis fixed by the condition that the state constructed by\nadding (removing) N/2 spinons to the ground state is a\nfully polarized state with N spins up (N spins down),\nwhich no more spinons can be added to (removed from).\nExpanding the spinon field about \u00b1kF , \u03a8s \u223c\neikF x \u03c8sR + e\u2212ikF x \u03c8sL , we can write a phenomenological Hamiltonian density of the form\nH = Hs + Hc + Hcs ,\n\n(A7)\n\nwhere\n\u2020\nHs = \u03c8sR\n(\u2212ivs(0) \u2202x + i\u03b3 (0) \u2202x3 )\u03c8sR\n\n\u2020\n+\u03c8sL\n(ivs(0) \u2202x \u2212 i\u03b3 (0) \u2202x3 )\u03c8sL + Hsint\n\n(A8)\n\nis the spinon Hamiltonian with spinon-spinon interactions contained in Hsint , Hc is the charge Hamiltonian\ngiven by the charge part of Eq. (7), and Hcs contains spinon-holon interactions. Due to spinon particlehole symmetry, the latter can only contain irrelevant\noperators (dimension three and higher), for instance,\n\u2020\n\u2202x \u03c8s,R/L \u2202x \u03c6cR/L .\n\u03c8s,R/L\n(0)\n\nThe parameters vs and \u03b3 (0) are renormalized by interactions (both spinon-spinon and spinon-holon). We\ndenote the parameters of the exact spinon dispersion by\nvs and \u03b3. As usually done for vs , the exact \u03b3 can be\nextracted from the Bethe ansatz solution in the case of\nintegrable models. For repulsive electron-electron interactions, we expect vs < vc , where vc is the exact charge\nvelocity. In this case, the lower edge of the spectrum\nof any dynamical correlation function at small momentum q (such that |\u03b3q 2 | \u001c vs < vc ) is controlled by the\nspinon branch line, with a single \"deep spinon\" with energy \u000fs (q) \u2261 \u000fsR (q) \u2248 vs q \u2212 \u03b3q 3 and a certain number of\nspinon or holon excitations at the Fermi points.\nWhether or not the band curvature of the spinon dispersion can be neglected in the calculation of dynamical\nquantities depends on the frequency range of interest.7\nFar enough from the threshold, for |\u03c9 \u2212 \u000fs (q)| \u001d \u03b3q 3 ,\nwe are allowed to drop the band curvature operators\nand the dynamics is captured by Luttinger liquid theory. We can bosonize \u03c8s,R/L in the standard way,23\n\u221a\n\u221a\ns\nusing \u03c8s,R/L \u223c e\u2212i 2\u03c0\u03c6R/L / 2\u03c0\u03b1, with chiral bosonic\nfields \u03c6sR/L and \u03b1 a short distance cutoff.

The\nlatter is fixed by SU(2) symmetry. In Abelian bosonization, we write S z \u223c \u2202x \u03c6sR \u2212 \u2202x \u03c6sL , which has scaling\ndimension 1. For S + , we bosonize the fermion and string\noperators in Eq. (A4) and obtain\nS+ \u223c e\n\n\u221a \u0010\u221a\n\u2212i 2\u03c0\nK\u2212\n\n1\n\u221a\n2 K\n\n\u0011\n\u221a \u0010\u221a\n\u03c6sR i 2\u03c0\nK+\n\ne\n\n1\n\u221a\n2 K\n\n\u0011\n\u03c6sL\n\n, (A10)\n\nwhich has scaling dimension K + 1/4K. Demanding that\nthis dimension is equal to 1 gives K = 1/2.\nOn the other hand, for |\u03c9 \u2212 \u000fs (q)| \u001c \u03b3q 3 , the behavior\nof dynamical correlation functions is sensitive to the band\ncurvature energy scale. In this regime, it is important\nto consider that spinons created near the threshold with\nenergy \u000fs (q) travel with a different velocity than spinons\nat the spinon Fermi surface. It has become standard\nto treat this type of problem using quantum impurity\nmodels in analogy with the x-ray edge singularity.16 In\norder to describe the deep spinon threshold, we expand\nthe spinon field with low and high energy subbands:\n\u03c8sR \u223c \u03c8sr + e\u2212iqx d\u2020s1 + eiqx ds2 .\n\n(A11)\n\n\f14\nThe subband momentum cutoff is taken to be small compared to q. For q > 0, we consider deep holes with momentum about kF \u2212q and high-energy particles with momentum about kF +q. These two types of excitations are\ndegenerate as a consequence of particle-hole symmetry.\nThe low energy \u03c8sr and \u03c8sl fields are then bosonized,\nwhile ds1,2 are treated as mobile impurities. We denote\nby \u03c6sr/l the chiral spin boson fields with the reduced cutoff\nat scale q. The interactions among low and high energy\nspinons and low energy charge bosons can be described\nby the effective Hamiltonian density\nH = Hc + Hs,` + Hd + Hsd + Hcd .\n\n(A12)\n\nHere Hc is the free charge boson Hamiltonian with reduced cutoff at scale q (fields denoted by \u03c6cr/l ).
