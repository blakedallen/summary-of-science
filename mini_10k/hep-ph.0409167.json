INTRODUCTION\nA. QCD phase structure\n\nQuantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is regarded as the fundamental theory of quarks and\ngluons. Its ultimate goal is to explain all strong interaction experiments at all energies, high\nand low. QCD is an asymptotically free theory [1]. At very high energies, interaction forces\nbecome weak, thus perturbation calculations can be used. The perturbative QCD predictions\nhave been extensively confirmed by experiments, while QCD in the non-perturbative regime\nis still a challenge to theorists. The fundamental quarks and gluons of QCD have not been\nseen as free particles, but are always confined within hadrons. It is still difficult to construct\nthe hadrons in terms of nearly massless quarks and gluons. The observed baryon spectrum\nindicates that the (approximate) chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken in the vacuum.\nAs a result, the eight pseudoscalar mesons \u03c0, K and \u03b7 are light pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone\nbosons, and the constituent quark obtains dynamical mass, which contributes to the baryon\nmass. Besides conventional mesons and baryons, QCD itself does not exclude the existence of\nthe non-conventional states such as glueballs, hybrid mesons and multi-quark states [2]. Last\nyear, pentaquarks, e.g., \u0398+ (u2 d2 s\u0304) [3] with the mass M = 1540 \u00b1 10MeV and \u039e\u2212\u2212 (s2 d2 \u016b) [4]\nwith M = 1862\u00b118MeV, were discovered in experiments. This has stirred a great interest of\ntheorists to understand the structure of the pentaquarks [5\u20138] as well as other fundamental\nproblems of QCD in the non-perturbative regime.\nSince 1970s, people have been interested in QCD at extreme conditions. It is expected\nthat the chiral symmetry can be restored, and quarks and gluons will become deconfined at\nhigh temperatures and/or densities [9\u201312]. Results from lattice show that the quark-gluon\nplasma (QGP) does exist. For the system with zero net baryon density, the deconfinement\nand chiral symmetry restoration phase transitions happen at the same critical temperature\n[13]. At asymptotically high temperatures, e.g., during the first microseconds of the \"Big\nBang\", the many-body system composed of quarks and gluons can be regarded as an ideal\nFermi and Boson gas. It is believed that the \"little Bang\" can be produced in RHIC and\nLHC. Recently, it was shown that the new state of matter produced in RHIC is far away\nfrom the asymptotically hot QGP, but in a strongly coupled regime. This state is called\nstrongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (sQGP). In this strong coupling system, the meson\nbound states still play an important role [14,15]. For most recent reviews about QGP, e.g.,\nsee Ref. [16\u201319].\nStudying QCD at finite baryon density is the traditional subject of nuclear physics. The\nbehaviour of QCD at finite baryon density and low temperature is central for astrophysics to\nunderstand the structure of compact stars, and conditions near the core of collapsing stars\n(supernovae, hypernovae). Cold nuclear matter, such as in the interior of a Pb nucleus,\nis at T = 0 and \u03bcB \u2243 mN = 940MeV. Emerging from this point, there is a first-order\nnuclear liquid-gas phase transition, which terminates in a critical endpoint at a temperature\n\u223c 10MeV [20]. If one squeezes matter further and further, nuleons will overlap. Quarks and\ngluons in one nucleon can feel quarks and gluons in other nucleons. Eventually, deconfinement phase transition will happen. Unfortunately, at the moment, lattice QCD is facing\nthe \"sign problem\" at nonzero net baryon densities. Our understanding at finite baryon\ndensities has to rely on effective QCD models. Phenomenological models indicated that, at\n2\n\n\fnonzero baryon density, the QGP phase and the hadron gas are separated by a critical line\nof roughly a constant energy density \u01ebcr \u2243 1GeV/fm3 [21].\nIn the case of asymptotically high baryon density, the system is a color superconducor.\nThis was proposed 25 years ago by Frautschi [22] and Barrois [23]. Reaching this conclusion\ndoes not need any other knowledge, if one knows that one-gluon exchange between two\nquarks is attractive in the color antitriplet channel, and if one is also familiar with the theory\nof superconductivity, i.e., the Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer (BCS) theory [24]. Based on\nthe BCS scenario, if there is a weak attractive interaction in a cold Fermi sea, the system\nis unstable with respect to the formation of particle-particle Cooper-pair condensate in the\nmomentum space. Detailed numerical calculations of color superconducting gaps were firstly\ncarried out by Bailin and Love [25]. They concluded that the one-gluon exchange induces\ngaps on the order of 1 MeV at several times of nuclear matter density. This small gap\nhas little effect on cold dense quark matter, thus the investigation of cold quark matter lay\ndormant for several decades. It was only revived recently when it was found that the color\nsuperconducting gap can be of the order of 100 MeV [26], which is two orders larger than\nearly perturbative estimates in Ref. [25]. For this reason, the topic of color superconductivity\nstirred a lot of interest in recent years. For review articles on the color superconductivity,\nsee for example, Refs. [16,27\u201333].\nIn this paper, I will focus on the color superconducting phase structure at intermediate\nbaryon density regime based on my own experience. It is worth to mention that there is\nanother good review article Ref. [32] in this regime from another point of view. The outline\nof this article is as follows: A brief overview of color superconducting phases is given in Sec.\nI B. In Sec. II, the generalized Nambu-Gorkov formalism is introduced to treat the chiral and\ndiquark condensates on an equal footing, and the competition between the chiral and color\nsuperconducting phase transitions is investigated. Sec. III focuses on homogeneous neutral\ntwo-flavor quark matter, the gapless 2SC (g2SC) phase and its properties are reviewed. In\nSec. IV, a neutral mixed phase composed of the 2SC phase and normal quark matter is\ndiscussed. At last, a brief outlook is given in Sec. V.\nB. Color superconducting phases\n\nLet us start with the system of free fermion gas. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion\nprinciple, which means no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. The\nenergy distribution for fermions (with mass m) has the form of\nf (Ep ) =\n\n1\ne\u03b2(Ep \u2212\u03bc)\n\n+1\n\n, \u03b2 = 1/T,\n\n(1.1)\n\np\nhere Ep =\np2 + m2 , \u03bc is the chemical potential and T is the temperature. At zero\ntemperature, f (Ep ) = \u03b8(\u03bc \u2212 Ep ). The ground state of the free fermion gas p\nis a filled\nFermi sea, i.e., all states with the momenta less than the Fermi momentum pF = \u03bc2 \u2212 m2\nare occupied, and the states with the momenta greater than the Fermi momentum pF are\nempty. Adding or removing a single fermion costs no free energy at the Fermi surface.\nFor the degenerate Fermi gas, the only relevant fermion degrees of freedom are those\nnear the Fermi surface. Considering two fermions near the Fermi surface, if there is a net\n3\n\n\fattraction between them, it turns out that they can form a bound state, i.e., Cooper pair\n[34]. The binding energy of the Cooper pair \u2206(K) (K the total momentum of the pair), is\nvery sensitive to K, being a maxium where K = 0. There is an infinite degeneracy among\npairs of fermions with equal and opposite momenta at the Fermi surface. Because Cooper\npairs are composite bosons, they will occupy the same lowest energy quantum state at zero\ntemperature and produce a Bose-Einstein condensation. Thus the ground state of the Fermi\nsystem with a weak attractive interaction is a complicated coherent state of particle-particle\nCooper pairs near the Fermi surface [24]. Exciting a quasiparticle and a hole which interact\nwith the condensate requires at least the energy of 2\u2206.\nIn QED case in condensed matter, the interaction between two electrons by exchanging\na photon is repulsive. The attractive interaction to form electron-electron Cooper pairs is by\nexchanging a phonon, which is a collective excitation of the positive ion background. The\nCooper pairing of the electrons breaks the electromagnetic gauge symmetry, and the photon\nobtains an effective mass. This indicates the Meissner effect [35], i.e., a superconductor\nexpels the magnetic fields.\nIn QCD case at asymptotically high baryon density, the dominant interaction between\ntwo quarks is due to the one-gluon exchange. This naturally provides an attractive interaction between two quarks. The scattering amplitude for single-gluon exchange in an SU(Nc )\ngauge theory is proportional to\n(Ta )ki (Ta )lj = \u2212\n\nNc + 1\nNc \u2212 1\n(\u03b4jk \u03b4il \u2212 \u03b4ik \u03b4jl ) +\n(\u03b4jk \u03b4il + \u03b4ik \u03b4jl ).\n4Nc\n4Nc\n\n(1.2)\n\nWhere Ta is the generator of the gauge group, and i, j and k, l are the fundamental colors\nof the two quarks in the incoming and outgoing channels, respectively. Under the exchange\nof the color indices of either the incoming or the outgoing quarks, the first term is antisymmetric, while the second term is symmetric. For Nc = 3, Eq. (1.2) represents that the tensor\nproduct of two fundamental colors decomposes into an (antisymmetric) color antitriplet and\na (symmetric) color sextet,\n[3]c \u2297 [3]c = [3\u0304]ca \u2295 [6]cs .\n\n(1.3)\n\nIn Eq. (1.2), the minus sign in front of the antisymmetric contribution indicates that the\ninteraction in this antitriplet channel is attractive, while the interaction in the symmetric\nsextet channel is repulsive.\nFor cold dense quark matter, the attractive interaction in the color antitriplet channel\ninduces the condensate of the quark-quark Cooper pairs, and the ground state is called the\n\"color superconductivity\". Since the diquark cannot be color singlet, the diquark condensate\nbreaks the local color SU(3)c symmetry, and the gauge bosons connected with the broken\ngenerators obtain masses. Comparing with the Higgs mechanism of dynamical gauge symmetry breaking in the Standard Model, here the diquark Cooper pair can be regarded as a\ncomposite Higgs particle. The calculation of the energy gap and the critical temperature\nfrom the first principles has been derived systematically in Refs. [36\u201343].\nIn reality, we are more interested in cold dense quark matter at moderate baryon density\nregime, i.e., \u03bcq \u223c 500MeV , which may exist in the interior of neutron stars. It is likely that\ncold dense quark droplet might be created in the laboratory through heavy ion collisions\n4\n\n\fin GSI-SPS energy scale. At these densities, an extrapolation of the asymptotic arguments\nbecomes unreliable, we have to rely on effective models. Calculations in the framework of\npointlike four-fermion interactions based on the instanton vertex [26,44\u201346], as well as in the\nNambu\u2013Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model [47\u201351] show that color superconductivity does occur at\nmoderate densities, and the magnitude of diquark gap is around 100 MeV.\nEven though the antisymmetry in the attractive channel signifies that only quarks with\ndifferent colors can form Cooper pairs, color superconductivity has very rich phase structure\nbecause of its flavor, spin and other degrees of freedom. In the following, I list some of the\nknown color superconducting phases.\nThe 2SC phase\nFirstly we consider a system with only massless u and d quarks, assuming that the\nstrange quark is much heavier than the up and down quarks. The color superconducting\nphase with only two flavors is normally called the 2SC phase.\nRenormalization group arguments [36,52,53] suggest that possible quark pairs always condense in the s\u2212wave. This means that the spin wave function of the pair is anti-symmetric.\nSince the diquark condenses in the color antitriplet 3\u0304c channel, the color wave function of\nthe pair is also anti-symmetric. The Pauli principle requires that the total wave function\nof the Cooper pair has to be antisymmetric under the exchange of the two quarks forming\nthe pair. Thus the flavor wave function has to be anti-symmetric, too. This determines the\nstructure of the order parameter\n\u03b1\u03b2b\n\u2206\u03b1\u03b2\n,\nij = \u2206\u01ebij \u01eb\n\n(1.4)\n\nwhere color indices \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 (r, g, b) and flavor indices i, j \u2208 (u, d). From the order parameter\nEq. (1.4), we can see that the condensate picks a color direction (here the blue direction,\nwhich is arbitrarily selected). The ground state is invariant under an SU(2)c subgroup of\nthe color rotations that mixes the red and green colors, but the blue quarks are singled out\nas different. Thus the color SU(3)c is broken down to its subgroup SU(2)c , and five of the\ngluons obtain masses, which indicates the Meissner effect [54].\nIn the 2SC phase, the Cooper pairs are ud \u2212 du singlets and the global flavor symmetry\nSU(2)L \u2297SU(2)R is intact, i.e., the chiral symmetry is not broken. There is also an unbroken\nglobal symmetry which plays the role of U(1)B . Thus no global symmetry are broken in the\n2SC phase.\nThe CFL phase\nIn the case when the chemical potential is much larger than the strange quark mass,\nwe can assume mu = md = ms = 0, and there are three degenerate massless flavors in the\nsystem. The spin-0 order parameter should be color and flavor anti-symmetric, which has\nthe form of\nX\n\u2206\u03b1\u03b2\n=\n\u2206\n\u01ebijI \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2I ,\n(1.5)\nij\nI\n\nwhere color indices \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 (r, g, b) and flavor indices i, j \u2208 (u, d, s). Writing\n\u03b4i\u03b1 \u03b4j\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b4j\u03b1 \u03b4i\u03b2 , we can see that the order parameter\n5\n\n\u03b1\u03b2I\nI \u01ebijI \u01eb\n\nP\n\n=\n\n\f\u03b1 \u03b2\n\u03b1 \u03b2\n\u2206\u03b1\u03b2\nij = \u2206(\u03b4i \u03b4j \u2212 \u03b4j \u03b4i )\n\n(1.6)\n\ndescribes the color-flavor locked (CFL) phase proposed in Ref. [55]. Many other different\ntreatments [56\u201358] agreed that a condensate of the form (1.5) is the dominant condensate\nin three-flavor QCD.\nIn the CFL phase, all quark colors and flavors participate in the pairing. The color gauge\ngroup is completely broken, and all eight gluons become massive [55,59], which ensures that\nthere are no infrared divergences associated with gluon propagators. Electromagnetism is\nno longer a separate symmetry, but corresponds to gauging one of the flavor generators. A\nrotated electromagnetism (\"Q\u0303\") remains unbroken.\nTwo global symmetries, the chiral symmetry and the baryon number, are broken in the\nCFL phase, too. In zero-density QCD, the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is due\nto the condensation of left-handed quarks with right-handed quarks. Here, at high baryon\ndensity, the chiral symmetry breaking occurs due to a rather different mechanism: locking\nof the flavor rotations to color. In the CFL phase, there is only pairing of left-handed quarks\nwith left-handed quarks, and right-handed quarks with right-handed quarks, i.e.,\n\u03b2\n\u03b1 \u03b2\n\u03b1\n< \u03c8Li\n\u03c8Lj >= \u2212 < \u03c8Ri\n\u03c8Rj\n>.\n\n(1.7)\n\nWhere L, R indicate left- and right-handed, respectively, \u03b1, \u03b2 are color indices and i, j are\nflavor indices. A gauge invariant form [27,60,61]\nk\nl\n\u03b1 \u03b2\n\u03b1 \u03b2\nk\nl\n\u03c8\u0304R\u03b2\n>\u223c< \u03c8Li\n\u03c8Lj >< \u03c8\u0304R\u03b1\n< \u03c8Li\n\u03c8Lj \u03c8\u0304R\u03b1\n\u03c8\u0304R\u03b2\n>\u223c \u22062 \u01ebijm \u01ebklm\n\n(1.8)\n\ncaptures the chiral symmetry breaking. The spectrum of excitations in the CFL phase\ncontains an octet of Goldstone bosons associated with the chiral symmetry breaking. This\nlooks remarkably like those at low density. In the excitation spectrum of the CFL phase,\nthere is another singlet U(1) Goldstone boson related to the baryon number symmetry\nbreaking, which can be described using the order parameter\n< udsuds >\u223c< \u039b\u039b > .\n\n(1.9)\n\nIn QCD with three degenerate light flavors, the spectrum in the CFL phase looks similar to\nthat in the hyper-nuclear phase at low-density. It is suggested that the low density hypernuclear phase and the high density quark phase might be continuously connected [62].\nSpin-1 color superconductivity\nIn the case of only one-flavor quark system, due to the antisymmetry in the color space,\nthe Pauli principle requires that the Cooper pair has to occur in a symmetric spin channel.\nTherefore, in the simplest case, the Cooper pairs carry total spin one. Spin-1 color superconductivity was firstly studied in Ref. [25], for more recent and detailed discussions about\nthe spin-1 gap, its critical temperature and Meissner effect, see Refs. [38,39,63\u201366]. For a\nreview, see Ref. [67].\nPairing with mismatch: LOFF, CFL-K, g2SC and gCFL\nTo form the Cooper pair, the ideal case isqwhen the two pairing quarks have the same\nFermi momenta, i.e., pF,i = pF,j with pF,i = \u03bc2F,i \u2212 m2i , like in the ideal 2SC, CFL, and\n6\n\n\fspin-1 color superconducting phases. However, in reality, the nonzero strange quark mass\nor the requirement of charge neutrality induces a mismatch between the Fermi momenta of\nthe two pairing quarks. When the mismatch is very small, it has little effect on the Cooper\npairing. While if the mismatch is very large, the Cooper pair will be destroyed. The most\ninteresting situation happens when the mismatch is neither very small nor very large.\nLOFF: In the regime just on the edge of decoupling of the two pairing quarks (due\nto the nonzero strange quark mass for the qs Cooper pair with q \u2208 (u, d) or the chemical\npotential difference for the ud Cooper pair), a \"LOFF\" (Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell)\nstate may be formed. The LOFF state was firstly investigated in the context of electron\nsuperconductivity in the presence of magnetic impurities [68,69]. It was found that near the\nunpairing transition, it is favorable to form a state in which the Cooper pairs have nonzero\nmomentum. This is favored because it gives rise to a regime of phase space where each of\nthe two quarks in a pair can be close to its Fermi surface, and such pairs can be created\nat low cost in free energy. This sort of condensates spontaneously break translational and\nrotational invariance, leading to gaps which vary periodically in a crystalline pattern. The\ncrystalline color superconductivity has been investigated in a series of papers, e.g., see Refs.\n[70\u201377].\nCFL-K: The strange quark mass ms induces an effective chemical potential \u03bcs =\n2\nms /(2pF ), and the effects of the strange quark mass can be quite dramatic. In the CFL\nphase, the K + and K 0 modes may be unstable for large values of the strange quark mass\nto form a kaon condensation [78\u201381]. In the framework of effective theory [60,61,82\u201384], the\nmasses of the Goldstone bosons can be determined as\n\u00151/2\n\u0014\nm2d \u2212 m2u\n4A\nm\u03c0\u00b1 = \u2213\n(mu + md )ms\n+\n,\n2pF\nf\u03c02\n\u00151/2\n\u0014\n4A\nm2s \u2212 m2u\n(mu + ms )md\n+\n,\nmK \u00b1 = \u2213\n2pF\nf\u03c02\n\u00151/2\n\u0014\nm2s \u2212 m2d\n4A\nmK 0 ,K\u0304 0 = \u2213\n(ms + md )mu\n+\n,\n2pF\nf\u03c02\n(1.10)\nwith A = 3\u22062 /(4\u03c0 2 ) [61,85]. It was found that the kaon masses are substantially affected\nby the strange quark mass, the masses of K \u2212 and K\u0304 0 are pushed up while K + and K 0 are\n1/3\nlowered. As a result, the K + and K 0 become massless if ms |crit = 3.03 md \u22062/3 . For larger\nvalues of ms the kaon modes are unstable, signaling the formation of a kaon condensate.\nFor review of the kaon condensate in the CFL phase, see Ref. [31]. Recently, it was found\nthat in the CFL phase, there also may exist \u03b7 condensate [86].\ng2SC and gCFL: When the \u03b2-equilibrium and the charge neutrality condition are\nrequired for the two-flavor quark system, the Fermi surfaces of the pairing u quark and d\nquark differ by \u03bce , here \u03bce is the chemical potential for electrons. It was found that when\nthe gap parameter \u2206 < \u03bce /2, the system will be in a new ground state called the gapless\n2SC (g2SC) phase [87]. The g2SC phase has very unusual temperature properties [88] and\nchromomagnetic properties [89]. This phase will be introduced in more detail in Sec. III.\nSimilarly, for a charge neutral 3-flavor system with a nonzero strange quark mass ms ,\nwith increasing ms , the CFL phase transfers to a new gapless CFL (gCFL) phase when\n7\n\n\fm2s /\u03bc \u2243 2\u2206 [90]. The finite temperature property of the charge neutral three-flavor quark\nmatter was investigated in Ref. [91\u201393]. Recently, it was shown that the kaon condensate\nshifts the critical strange quark mass to higher values for the appearance of the gCFL phase\n[94].\nII. COMPETITION BETWEEN THE CHIRAL AND DIQUARK CONDENSATES\n\nIn this section, we are going to investigate the competition between the chiral and diquark\ncondensates, and the content is based on Refs. [51,97].\nIn the idealized case at asymptotically high baryon densities, the color superconductivity\nwith two massless flavors and the color-flavor-locking (CFL) phase with three degenerate\nmassless quarks have been widely discussed from first principle QCD calculations. Usually,\nthe diagrammatic methods are used at the asymptotic densities. The Green-function of the\neight-component field and the gap equation were discussed in details in [38,95]. Neither\ncurrent quark mass nor chiral condensate are necessary to be considered because they can\nbe neglected compared to the very high Fermi surface. At less-than-asymptotic densities,\nthe corrections of nonzero quark mass to the pure CFL phase can be treated perturbatively\nby expanding the current quark mass around the chiral limit [85,96].\nFor physical applications, we are more interested in the moderate baryon density regime,\nwhich may be related to the neutron stars and, in very optimistic cases even to heavy-ion\ncollisions. To work out the phase structure from the hadron phase to the color superconducting phase, one should deal with the chiral condensate and the diquark condensate\nsimultaneously. Because the chiral condensation contributes a dynamical quark mass, it is\nnot reasonable any more to treat the quark mass term perturbatively in this density regime.\nUsually, at moderate baryon density regime, effective models such as the instanton model,\nas well as the Nambu\u2013Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model, are used. The model parameters are fixed\nin the QCD vacuum. In this regime, the usual way is to use the variational methods, which\nare enough for constructing the thermodynamic potential and the gap equation to investigate\nthe ground state. In order to investigate the diquark excitations, and to calculate the crosssection of physical process in the color superconducting phase, it is very helpful to use the\nGreen-function approach.\nOne of our main aims in this section is to apply the Green-function approach in the\nmoderate baryon density regime. By using the energy projectors for massive quark, we can\ndeal with the chiral and diquark condensates on an equal footing, and we will deduce the\nNambu-Gorkov massive quark propagator [97] as well as the thermodynamic potential [51].\nIn the normal phase, the quarks of different colors are degenerate. While in the color\nbroken phase, it is natural to assume that the quarks involved in the diquark condensate\nare different from the free quarks. It is difficult to obtain the mass expression for the quarks\nparticipating in the diquark condensate, because the particles and holes mix with each other,\nand the elementary excitations are quasi-particles and quasi-holes near the Fermi surface.\nThe difference between quarks in different colors has been reflected by their propagators,\nand the difference can be read through calculating the quarks chiral condensate. In the\nchiral limit, the chiral condensate disappears entirely in the color superconducting phase,\nand it is not possible to investigate the influence of the color breaking on quarks in different\n8\n\n\fcolors, so we keep the small current quark mass in this section.\nIn the moderate baryon density regime, people are interested in whether there exists\na regime where both the chiral symmetry and color symmetry are broken [45\u201347,98\u2013102].\nNote that the presence of a small current quark mass induces that the chiral symmetry\nonly restores partially and there always exists a small chiral condensate in the color superconducting phase. This phenomenon had been called coexistence of the chiral and diquark\ncondensates in Ref. [45]. In the coexistence regime resulted by current quark mass, the chiral\ncondensate is small comparing with the diquark condensate, and the role of the chiral condensate can be prescribed by the Anderson theorem [102], i.e., in this phase, the contribution\nof the chiral condensate to thermodynamic quantities becomes strongly suppressed, and one\ncan calculate the diquark condensate neglecting the influence of the chiral condensate.\nIn order to differ from the coexistence of the diquark condensate and the small chiral\ncondensate in the chiral symmetry restoration phase, the coexistence of the diquark condensate and the dynamical chiral condensate in the chiral symmetry breaking phase is called\nthe double broken phase. The existence of the double broken phase depends on the coupling constants GS and GD in the quark-antiquark and diquark channels [47,101]. In the\ncase of small ratio of GD /GS < 1, the calculations in the instanton model [45], NJL model\n[47] and random matrix model [101] show that there is no double broken phase. While for\nGD /GS > 1 the calculations in the the random matrix model [101] and the NJL model\n[47] show that there exists a narrow regime where both chiral (dynamical) symmetry and\ncolor symmetry are broken, and the chiral and diquark condensate coexist. The larger value\nof GD /GS is, the wider regime of the double broken phase has been found in the random\nmatrix model [101].\nIn this section, based on Ref. [51], we explain the existence of the double broken phase\nby analyzing the influence of the diquark condensate on the Fermi surface of the constituent\nquark. In the mean-field approximation of the NJL model, the thermal system of the\nconstituent quarks is nearly an ideal Fermi gas, and there is a sharp Fermi surface for\nthe constituent quark. When a diquark condensate is formed, the Cooper pair smoothes the\nFermi surface, and this induces the chiral symmetry restoring at a smaller chemical potential.\nThe stronger the coupling constant in the diquark channel, the larger the diquark gap will\nbe, and the smaller critical chemical potential will be for the color superconductivity phase\ntransition. However, it is found in Ref. [51] that, if GD /GS > 1, the diquark condensate\nstarts to appear even in the vacuum. This may suggest that in the NJL model, the diquark\ncoupling strength GD should not be larger than the quark-antiquark coupling strength GS .\nIt is also possible that the appearance of the diquark condensate in vacuum is an artificial\nresult due to the lack of deconfinement in the NJL model.\nA. The extended NJL model\n\nTo describe quark matter in the intermediate baryon density regime, we use the extended\nNJL model. The choice of the NJL model [103] is motivated by the fact that this model\ndisplays the same symmetries as QCD and that it describes well the spontaneous breakdown\nof chiral symmetry in the vacuum and its restoration at high temperature and density. For\nthe review of the NJL model, please see [104]. The model we used in this paper is an\n9\n\n\fextended version of the two-flavor NJL model including interactions in the color singlet\nquark-antiquark channel as well as in the color anti-triplet diquark channel, which is not\ndirectly extended from the NJL model, but from the QCD Lagrangian [105\u2013107].\nThe importance of color 3\u0304 diquark degree of freedom is related to the fact that one can\nconstruct a color-singlet nucleon current based on it. Because the gluon exchange between\ntwo quarks in the color 3\u0304 channel is attractive, one can view a color singlet baryon as a\nquark-diquark bound state. And experimental data from ep collisions indicate the existence\nof this quark-diquark component in nucleons [108]. The discovery of the pentaquark also\nreminds us the importance of the diquark degree of freedom [6,7,109].\nThe first attempt to investigate the diquark properties in the NJL model was taken in\nRef. [110]. Starting from an NJL model for scalar, pseudoscalar, vector and axial-vector\ninteractions of the (q\u0304q) \u00d7 (q\u0304q) type and Fierz-transforming away the vector and axial-vector\ninteractions, the scalar and pseudoscalar mesons, and diquarks can be obtained. However,\nthis method could not get a consistent treatment of vector and axial-vector particles.\nThe extended NJL model we use is derived from the QCD Lagrangian [105,106]. Integrating out the gluon degrees of freedom from the QCD Lagrangian, and performing a local\napproximation for the (nonperturbative) gluon propagator, one obtains a contact currentcurrent interaction. By using a special Fierz-rearrangement [111] (see Appendix A), one can\ncompletely decompose the two-quark-current interaction term into \"attractive\" color singlet\n(q\u0304q) and color antitriplet (qq) channels. In this way, a complete simultaneous description\nof scalar, pseudo-scalar, vector, and axial-vector mesons and diquarks is possible, thus the\nextended NJL model including (q\u0304q) \u00d7 (q\u0304q) interactions is completed by a corresponding\n(q\u0304 q\u0304) \u00d7 (qq) interaction part.\nIt is worth to mention that, in the mean-field approximation, there is a famous ambiguity connected with performing the Fierz transformation for the pointlike four-fermion\ninteraction. For more detail discussion about the Fierz ambiguity, see Ref. [113]. Here, in\nthis paper, we only consider the scalar, pseudoscalar mesons and scalar diquark, and the\nLagrangian density has the form\nL = q\u0304(i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u2212 m0 )q + GS [(q\u0304q)2 + (q\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 q)2 ] + GD [(iq\u0304 C \u03b5\u01ebb \u03b35 q)(iq\u0304\u03b5\u01ebb \u03b35 q C )].\n\n(2.1)\n\nWhere q C = C q\u0304 T , q\u0304 C = q T C are charge-conjugate spinors, C = i\u03b3 2 \u03b3 0 is the charge conjugation matrix (the superscript T denotes the transposition operation). For more details\nabout the charge conjugate, see Appendix B. m0 is the current quark mass, the quark field\nq \u2261 qi\u03b1 with i = 1, 2 and \u03b1 = 1, 2, 3 is a flavor doublet and color triplet, as well as a fourcomponent Dirac spinor, \u03c4 = (\u03c4 1 , \u03c4 2 , \u03c4 3 ) are Pauli matrices in the flavor space, where \u03c4 2 is\nantisymmetric, and (\u03b5)ik \u2261 \u03b5ik , (\u01ebb )\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2b are totally antisymmetric tensors in the flavor\nand color spaces.\nThough, from the Fierz transformation, the quark-antiquark coupling constant GS and\nthe diquark coupling constant GD have the relation GD = GS Nc /(2Nc \u2212 2), in this article,\nGS and GD are treated independently. The former is responsible for the meson excitations,\nand the latter for the diquark excitations, which in principle can be determined by fitting\nmeson and baryon properties in the vacuum. In Ref. [106], the ratio of coupling constants\nGD /GS \u2243 2.26/3 was obtained by fitting the scalar diquark mass of 600 MeV to get a\nrealistic vacuum baryon mass. It is noticed that this ratio is quite close to the value 3/4\nobtained from Fierz transformation.\n10\n\n\fThe attractive interaction in different channels in the Lagrangian gives rise to a very rich\nstructure of the phase diagram. At zero temperature and density, the attractive interaction\nin the color singlet channel is responsible for the appearance of a quark-antiquark condensate\nand for the spontaneous breakdown of the chiral symmetry, and the interaction in the qq\nchannel binds quarks into diquarks (and baryons), but is not strong enough to induce diquark\ncondensation.

If\nthere is a small mass term, the quark propagator can be expanded perturbatively around\nm = 0, but the form is very complicated [96]. In our case the quark mass term cannot\nbe treated perturbatively, we have to find a general way to deal with the massive quark\npropagator.\nFortunately, we can evaluate a simple form for the massive quark propagator by using\nthe energy projectors for massive particles. The energy projectors onto states of positive\nand negative energy for free massive particles are defined as\n1\n\u03b30 (\u03b3 * p + m)\n\u039b\u00b1 (p) = (1 \u00b1\n),\n(2.21)\n2\nEp\np\nwhere the quark energy Ep = p2 + m2 .

The propagator has four poles, i.e.,\np0 = \u2213Ep+ ,\n\np0 = \u00b1Ep\u2212 ,\n\n(2.25)\n\nwhere the former two correspond to the excitation energies of particles and holes, and the\nlatter two are for antiparticles and antiholes, respectively.\nThe full quark propagator G, i.e., (2.19) can be evaluated [97]. The normal quark\npropagator has the form\nG\u00b1 = (\n\np0 \u2212 Ep\u00b1\n\np20\n\n\u03b3 \u039b\u0303 +\n\u00b12 0 +\n\n\u2212 E\u2206\n\np0 + Ep\u2213\np20\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b3 \u039b\u0303 )(\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2\n\u22132 0 \u2212\nE\u2206\n\n\u2212 \u03b4\u03b1b \u03b4\u03b2b )\u03b4 ij ,\n\n(2.26)\n\nand the abnormal quark propagator reads\n\u039e\u00b1 = (\n2\n\n\u2206\u00b1\n\n\u039b\u0303 +\n\u00b12 +\n\np20 \u2212 E\u2206\n\n\u2206\u00b1\n\u2213\np20 \u2212 E\u2206\n\n2 \u039b\u0303\u2212 ),\n\n(2.27)\n\n2\n\n\u00b1\nwith E\u2206\n= Ep\u00b1 + \u22062 . This propagator is similar to the massless propagator derived in [95].\nThe four poles of the Nambu-Gorkov propagator, i.e.,\n\u2212\np0 = \u00b1E\u2206\n,\n\n+\np0 = \u2213E\u2206\n,\n\n(2.28)\n\ncorrespond to the excitation energies of quasi-particles (quasi-holes) and quasi-antiparticle\n(quasi-antiholes) in the color broken phase. These quasi-particles are superpositions of\nparticles and holes, and are called \"Bogoliubons\". In the normal phase, exciting a pair of a\nparticle and a hole on the Fermi surface does not need energy, while in the superconducting\nphase, exciting a quasi-particle and a hole needs at least the energy 2\u2206 at Ep = \u03bc.\nC. Gap equations\n\nWith the Nambu-Gorkov quark propagator Eqs. (2.26) and (2.27), one can investigate\nthe meson excitations [116], and physical processes related to the transport properties. The\nchiral and diquark condensates can also be generally expressed from the quasi-particle propagator. The diquark condensate has the form\nX Z d3 p\nC\n< q\u0304 \u03b35 q >= \u2212iT\ntr[\u039e\u2212 \u03b35 ].\n(2.29)\n3\n(2\u03c0)\nn\n14\n\n\fFrom general consideration, there should be eight Dirac components of the diquark condensates [25,95,117,118]. In the case of the NJL type model, the diquark condensates related\nto momentum vanish, and there is only one independent 0+ diquark gap with Dirac structure \u0393 = \u03b35 for massless quark, and there exists another 0+ diquark condensate with Dirac\nstructure \u0393 = \u03b30 \u03b35 at nonzero quark mass.

Competition between the chiral and diquark condensates\n\nIn this subsection, through numerical calculations, we will investigate the phase structure\nalong the chemical potential direction, analyze the competition mechanism between the\nchiral condensate and diquark condensate, and discuss the influence of the color breaking\non the quarks with different colors.\nBefore the numerical calculations, we should fix the model parameters. The current\nquark mass m0 = 5.5MeV, the Fermion momentum cut-off \u039bf = 0.637GeV, and the coupling constant in color singlet channel GS = 5.32GeV\u22122 are determined by fitting vacuum properties. The corresponding constituent quark mass in the vacuum is taken to be\nm(\u03bc = 0) = 330MeV. The coupling constant in the color anti-triplet channel GD can in\nprinciple be determined by fitting the nucleon properties, here, we choose GD /GS as a free\nparameter.\nThe double broken phase\nFirstly, we investigate the phase structure along the chemical potential direction with\nrespect to different magnitude of GD /GS . In the explicit chiral symmetry breaking case,\nwe define the point at which the chiral condensate has maximum change as the critical\nchemical potential \u03bc\u03c7 for the chiral phase transition, and the point at which the diquark\ncondensate starts to appear as the critical chemical potential \u03bc\u2206 for the color superconductivity phase transition. The two gaps m (white points) and \u2206 (black points) determined\nby Eqs. (2.32) and (2.36) are plotted in Fig. 1 as functions of \u03bc with respect to different\nGD /GS = 2/3, 1, 1.2, 1.5 in (a), (b), (c) and (d), respectively.\nIn Fig. 1 (a), i.e., in the case of GD /GS = 2/3, we see that the chiral phase transition\nand the color superconductivity phase transition occur nearly at the same chemical potential\n\u03bc\u03c7 \u2243 \u03bc\u2206 = 340 MeV. The two phase transitions are of first order. In the explicit chiral\nsymmetry breaking case, there is a small chiral condensate in the color superconductivity\n18\n\n\fFIG. 1. The two gaps m (white points) and \u2206 (black points) as functions of chemical potential\n\u03bc for GD /GS = 2/3, 1, 1.2, 1.5, respectively.\n\nphase \u03bc > \u03bc\u03c7 . This phenomena has been called the coexistence of the chiral and diquark\ncondensate in Ref. [45]. In this coexistence regime, the chiral condensate is small and can\nbe described by the Anderson theorem [102].\nIn Fig. 1 (b), with GD /GS = 1, the diquark condensate starts to appear at \u03bc\u2206 = 298 MeV,\nand the chiral symmetry restores at \u03bc\u03c7 = 304.8 MeV. Both \u03bc\u2206 and \u03bc\u03c7 are smaller than\nthose in the case of GD /GS = 2/3. In the regime from \u03bc\u2206 to \u03bc\u03c7 , we also see the coexistence\nof the chiral and diquark condensates. However, the chiral condensate in this regime is\nnot due to the explicit symmetry breaking but due to the dynamical symmetry breaking.\nIn order to differ the coexistence of the diquark condensate and the small quark-antiquark\ncondensate in the chiral symmetric phase as in Fig. 1 (a), we call the coexistence of the\ndiquark condensate and the large quark-antiquark condensate in the chiral symmetry broken\nphase as the \"double broken phase\". The diquark gap increases continuously from zero to\n82 MeV in this double broken phase, and jumps up to 152 MeV at the critical point \u03bc\u03c7 .\nIn Fig. 1 (c) and (d), we see that with increasing of GD /GS , the diquark condensate\nstarts to appear at smaller \u03bc\u2206 , and chiral symmetry restores at smaller \u03bc\u03c7 , while the width\nof the regime of double broken phase, \u03bc\u03c7 \u2212 \u03bc\u2206 , becomes larger. This phenomena has also\nbeen found in Ref. [101] in the random matrix model.\nHowever, as shown in Fig. 2 (b), (c) and (d), in the three cases GD /GS = 1, 1.2, 1.5, the\ndiquark condensate starts to appear even in the vacuum where nb = 0 with nb the baryon\n19\n\n\fnumber density. This, of course, is not physical, because a nonzero diquark condensate\nmeans the appearance of a nonzero Majorana mass for quarks in vacuum. This would be\nin conflict with the standard definition of the bayron number in vacuum. The appearance\nof the diquark condensate in the vacuum may indicate that, in the NJL model, the diquark\ncoupling strength GD cannot be very large, and it should be smaller than the coupling\nstrength GS in the quark-antiquark channel. However, it is worth to mention that the\nappearance of the diquark condensate in the vacuum may be a consequence of the lack of\ndeconfinement in the NJL model.\n\nFIG. 2. The two gaps m (white points) and \u2206 (black points) as functions of scaled baron\ndensity nb /n0 for GD /GS = 2/3, 1, 1.2, 1.5, respectively. Where n0 is the normal nuclear matter\ndensity.\n\nWe summarize the phase structure along the chemical potential direction: 1) when \u03bc <\n\u03bc\u2206 , the chiral symmetry is broken; 2) in the regime from \u03bc\u2206 to \u03bc\u03c7 , both chiral and color\nsymmetries are broken, and 3) when \u03bc > \u03bc\u03c7 , the chiral symmetry restores partially and\nthe phase is dominated by the color superconductivity. The phase structure depends on the\nmagnitude of GD /GS . If GD /GS is very small, the diquark condensate will never appear;\nIf GD /GS < 1 but not too small, there will be no double broken phase, the chiral phase\ntransition and the color superconductivity phase transition occur at the same critical point\n\u03bc\u03c7 = \u03bc\u2206 . With increasing of GD /GS , the diquark condensate starts to appear at smaller \u03bc\u2206\nand the chiral symmetry restores at smaller \u03bc\u03c7 , and the width of the double broken phase,\n\u03bc\u03c7 \u2212 \u03bc\u2206 , increases.\n20\n\n\fCompetition between the chiral and diquark condensates\nIn order to understand the competition mechanism and explicitly show how the diquark\ncondensate influences the chiral phase transition, let us analyze Fig. 1 in more detail. In the\ncase of GD /GS = 0, only chiral phase transition occurs, the thermal system in the meanfield approximation is nearly a free Fermi gas made of constituent quarks. In the limit of\nT = 0, there is a very sharp Fermi surface of the constituent quark. When the chemical\npotential is larger than the constituent quark mass in the vacuum, the chiral symmetry\nrestores, and the system of constituent quarks becomes a system of current quarks. When\na diquark gap \u2206 forms in the case of GD /GS 6= 0, it will smooth the sharp Fermi surface of\nthe constituent quark. In other words, the diquark pair lowers the sharp Fermi surface, and\ninduces a smaller critical chemical potential of chiral restoration.\nIn TABLE I, we list the chemical potentials \u03bc\u2206 , at which the diquark gap starts appearing, and \u03bc\u03c7 , at which the chiral symmetry restores, for different values of GD /GS .\n\u03bc0F = 345.3 MeV is the critical chemical potential in the case of GD /GS = 0. \u2206\u03c7 is the value\nof diquark gap at \u03bc\u03c7 , if there is a jump, it is the lower value.\n\nGD /GS\n1\n1.2\n1.5\n\n\u03bc\u2206 (MeV)\n298\n242\n70\n\n\u03bc\u03c7 (MeV)\n304.8\n266\n190\n\n\u03bc\u03c7 \u2212 \u03bc\u2206 (MeV)\n6\n24\n120\n\n\u2206\u03c7 (MeV)\n82\n162\n310\n\n(\u03bc0F \u2212 \u03bc\u03c7 )/\u2206\u03c7\n0.49\n0.49\n0.50\n\n(\u03bc0F \u2212 \u03bc\u2206 )/\u2206\u03c7\n0.57\n0.64\n0.89\n\nTABLE I. The GD dependence of chemical potentials \u03bc\u2206 and \u03bc\u03c7 , \u03bc0F = 345.3MeV.\n\nWe see that for larger GD /GS , the diquark condensate appears at a smaller chemical\npotential \u03bc\u2206 , and the chiral phase transition occurs at a smaller critical chemical potential\n\u03bc\u03c7 , the gap of the diquark condensate \u2206\u03c7 at \u03bc\u03c7 becomes larger, and the regime of the double\nbroken phase becomes wider.\nWe assume the relation between \u2206\u03c7 and \u03bc\u03c7 as\n\u03bc\u03c7 = \u03bc0F \u2212 x\u2206\u03c7 ,\n\n(2.57)\n\nand the relation between \u2206\u03c7 and \u03bc\u2206 as\n\u03bc\u2206 = \u03bc0F \u2212 y\u2206\u03c7 .\n\n(2.58)\n\nIn TABEL I, we listed the values of x = (\u03bc0F \u2212 \u03bc\u03c7 )/\u2206\u03c7 and y = (\u03bc0F \u2212 \u03bc\u2206 )/\u2206\u03c7 for\ndifferent GD /GS . It is found that x is almost GD /GS independent and equal to 1/2. As for\ny, it is larger than 1/2 and increases with increasing of GD /GS . From the Eqs. (2.57) and\n(2.58), we have the relation\n\u03bc\u03c7 \u2212 \u03bc\u2206 = (y \u2212 1/2)\u2206\u03c7\n\n(2.59)\n\nfor the double broken phase. With increasing of GD /GS , y and \u2206\u03c7 increase, and then the\nwidth of the double broken phase, \u03bc\u03c7 \u2212 \u03bc\u2206 , becomes larger.\n21\n\n\fNow we turn to study how the chiral gap influences the color superconductivity phase\ntransition. Firstly, we change the constituent quark mass in the vacuum from 330 MeV to\n486MeV. To fit the pion properties, the coupling constant in the quark-antiquark channel\nis correspondingly increased from GS to 1.2GS . We plot the diquark gap as a function of \u03bc\nin Fig. 3a for the two vacuum masses and for GD /GS = 2/3, 1, 1.2, 1.5. We find that for the\nsame GD /GS , the diquark gap starts to appear at much larger chemical potential \u03bc\u2206 when\nthe vacuum mass increases from 330 MeV to 486 MeV.\n\nFIG. 3. The influence of chiral gap on the color superconductivity phase transition in the case\nof m(\u03bc = 0) = 486MeV in (a) and m(\u03bc = 0) = 0 in (b).\n\nThen we withdraw the quark mass, i.e., taking m = 0 even in the vacuum (this, of\ncourse, is artificial). We plot the diquark gap as a function of \u03bc in Fig. 3 b for m(\u03bc = 0) = 0\nand 330 MeV and for GD /GS = 2/3, 1, 1.2, 1.5. We find that for any GD /GS , the diquark\ncondensate starts to appear at a much smaller chemical potential \u03bc\u2206 for m(\u03bc = 0) = 0\ncompared with m(\u03bc = 0) = 330 MeV.\nFrom Fig. 3 a and b, we can see that the vacuum quark mass only changes the critical\n22\n\n\fpoint of color superconductivity \u03bc\u2206 , the diquark gaps for different vacuum quark masses\ncoincide in the overlap regime of the color superconductivity phase, where chiral symmetry\nrestores partially.\nFrom the influence of the diquark gap on the chiral phase transition and the influence\nof the chiral gap on the color superconductivity phase transition, it is found that there\ndoes exist a strong competition between the two phases. The competition starts at \u03bc\u2206 and\nends at \u03bc\u03c7 . We call the double broken phase as the competition regime, which becomes\nwider with increasing of GD /GS . This competition regime is the result of the diquark gap\nsmoothing the sharp Fermi surface of the constituent quark. If the attractive interaction\nin the diquark channel is too small, there will be no diquark pairs, the system will be in\nthe chiral breaking phase before \u03bc\u03c7 , and in the chiral symmetry restoration phase after \u03bc\u03c7 .\nIf the attractive interaction in the diquark channel is strong enough, diquark pairs can be\nformed and smooth the sharp Fermi surface, and induce a smaller critical chemical potential\nof chiral symmetry restoration.\nThe influence of color breaking on quark properties\nFinally, we study how the diquark condensate influences the quark properties. In the\nnormal phase, the quarks in different colors are degenerate. However, in the color breaking\nphase, the red and green quarks are involved in the diquark condensate, while the blue\nquarks do not.\n\nFIG. 4. The difference of the chiral condensates for quarks in different colors \u03b4 as a function of\nthe chemical potential \u03bc with respect to GD /GS = 2/3, 1, 1.2, 1.5, respectively.\n\nThe quark mass m appeared in the formulae of this section is the mass for the third\nquark which does not participate in the diquark condensate. We have seen that the diquark\ncondensate influences much the quark mass m in the competition regime \u03bc\u2206 < \u03bc < \u03bc\u03c7 . In\n23\n\n\fthe color breaking phase, i.e., when \u03bc > \u03bc\u2206 , the quark mass m in different cases of GD\ndecreases slowly with increasing \u03bc, and reaches the same value at about \u03bc = 500MeV.\nThe difference of the chiral condensates for quarks in different colors \u03b4 defined in Eq.\n(2.38) is shown in Fig. 4 as a function of the chemical potential \u03bc with respect to GD /GS =\n2/3, 1, 1.2, 1.5. It is found that in any case \u03b4 is zero before \u03bc\u2206 , then begins to increase at \u03bc\u2206\nand reaches its maximum at \u03bc\u03c7 , and starts to decrease after \u03bc > \u03bc\u03c7 , and approaches to zero\nat about \u03bc = 500 MeV, when \u03bc > 500 MeV, \u03b4 becomes negative. With increasing GD , \u03b4(\u03bc\u03c7 )\nincreases from 1 MeV for GD /GS = 2/3 to 13 MeV for GD /GS = 1.5. Comparing with the\nmagnitude of the diquark condensate, \u03b4 is relatively small in the color superconductivity\nphase.\nSummary of this section\nIn the mean-field approximation of the extended NJL model, considering only the attractive interactions in the 0+ color singlet quark-antiquark channel and in the color anti-triplet\ndiquark channel, the Nambu-Gorkov form of the quark propogator has been evaluated with\na dynamical quark mass. The Nambu-Gorkov massive propagator makes it possible to\nextend the Green-function approach to the moderate baryon density regime. The familiar\nexpression of the thermodynamic potential has been re-evaluated by using the massive quark\npropagator.\nThe phase structure along the chemical potential direction has been investigated. The\nsystem is in the chiral symmetry breaking phase below \u03bc\u2206 , in the color superconducting\nphase above \u03bc\u03c7 , and the two phases compete with each other in the double broken phase\nwith width \u03bc\u03c7 \u2212 \u03bc\u2206 . The existence of the double broken phase depends on the magnitude of\nGD /GS . If GD < GS , there is no double broken phase, the chiral phase transition and the\ncolor superconductivity phase transition occur at the same chemical potential. The double\nbroken phase starts to appear when GD /GS \u2243 1, and the regime of this phase becomes\nwider when the diquark coupling strength increases.\nThe double broken phase is a consequence of the competition between the chiral condensate and the diquark condensate. The competition mechanism has been analyzed by\ninvestigating the influence of the diquark condensate on the sharp Fermi surface of the constituent quark. The diquark condensate smoothes the sharp Fermi surface, and induces the\nchiral phase transition and the color superconducting phase transition occurring at smaller\ncritical chemical potentials. The stronger the diquark coupling strength is, the smaller critical chemical potential (or the critical baryon number density) will be for the appearance of\nthe diquark condensate.\nHowever, it is found that when GD /GS \u2265 1, the diquark condensate appears even in the\nvacuum. It indicates a nonzero Majorana mass for quarks in the vacuum, which would be in\nconflict with the standard definition of the bayron number in the vacuum. This unphysical\nresult may suggest that in the NJL model, the diquark coupling strength GD cannot be\nvery large. For the parameters of the NJL model used in this section, our results suggest\nthat the diquark coupling strength should be smaller than the coupling strength GS in the\nquark-antiquark channel. Correspondingly, the upper limit of the diquark gap parameter \u2206\nis about 200 MeV. It is also worth to mention that the appearance of the diquark condensate\nin the vacuum may be a result of the lack of deconfinement in the NJL model.\n24\n\n\fIII. THE GAPLESS 2SC PHASE\n\nIn the previous section, we discussed the phase transition from the hadronic phase to\nthe color superconducting phase. Now we are going to discuss the two-flavor color superconducting phase under the local charge neutrality condition based on Refs. [87\u201389,121].\nIt is very likely that the color superconducting phase may exist in the core of compact\nstars, where bulk matter should satisfy the charge neutrality condition. This is because bulk\nmatter inside the neutron star is bound by the gravitation force, which is much weaker than\nthe electromagnetic and the strong color forces. Any electric charges or color charges will\nforbid the formation of bulk matter. In addition, matter inside neutron star also needs to\nsatisfy the \u03b2-equilibrium.\nIn the ideal two-flavor color superconducting (2SC) phase, the pairing u and d quarks\nhave the same Fermi momenta. Because u quark carries electric charge 2/3, and d quark\ncarries electric charge \u22121/3, it is easy to check that quark matter in the ideal 2SC phase\nis positively charged. To satisfy the electric charge neutrality condition, roughly speaking,\ntwice as many d quarks as u quarks are needed. This induces a large difference between\nthe Fermi surfaces of the two pairing quarks, i.e., \u03bcd \u2212 \u03bcu = \u03bce \u2248 \u03bc/4, where \u03bc, \u03bce are\nchemical potentials for quarks and electrons, respectively. Naively, one would expect that\nthe requirement of the charge neutrality condition will destroy the ud Cooper pairing in the\n2SC phase.\nIndeed, the interest in the charge neutral 2SC phase was stirred by the paper Ref. [119].\nIt was claimed in this paper that there will be no 2SC phase inside neutron star under the\nrequirement of the charge neutrality condition. In fact, the authors meant that for a charge\nneutral three flavor system, the 2SC+s phase is not favorable compared to the CFL phase.\nThis is a natural result under the assumption of a small strange quark mass, even without\nthe requirement of the charge neutrality condition. In the framework of the bag model, in\nwhich the strange quark mass is very small, the CFL phase is always the ground state for\ncold dense quark matter, and there is no space for the existence of two-flavor quark matter.\nHowever, there is another scenario about the hadron-quark phase transition in the framework of the SU(3) NJL model. In the vacuum, quarks obtain their dynamical masses induced\nby the chiral condensate. u, d quarks have constituent mass around 330MeV, while the s\nquark has heavier constituent mass, which is around 500MeV. With the increasing of the\nbayron density, the constituent quark mass starts to decrease when the chemical potential\nbecomes larger than its vacuum constituent mass. In this scenario, s quark restores chiral\nsymmetry at a larger critical chemical potential than that of u, d quarks. If the deconfinement phase transition happens sequentially, there will exist some baryon density regime for\nonly u, d quark matter and s quark is still too heavy to appear in the system.\nIt is worth to mention that the effect of the electric charge neutrality condition on a\nthree-flavor quark system is very different from that on a two-flavor quark system. Because\ns quark carries \u22121/3 electric charges, it is much easier to neutralize the electric charges\nin a three-flavor quark system than that in a two-flavor quark system. However, the color\ncharge neutrality condition is nontrivial in a three-flavor quark system, when the strange\nquark mass is not very small. For a detailed consideration of the charge neutral three-flavor\nsystem, see recent papers Refs. [90\u201393].\nIn the following, we focus on the charge neutral two flavor quark system. Motivated by\n25\n\n\fthe sequential deconfinement scenario, the authors of Ref. [120] investigated charge neutral\nquark matter based on the SU(3) NJL model. To large extent, their results agree with those\nin Ref. [119], i.e., the CFL phase is more favorable than the 2SC+s phase in charge neutral\nthree-flavor cold dense quark matter, and they did not find the charge neutral 2SC phase.\nHowever, it was found in Ref. [121] that a charge neutral two-flavor color superconducting\n(N2SC) phase does exist, which was confirmed in Refs. [122,123]. Comparing with the ideal\n2SC phase, the N2SC phase found in Ref. [121] has a largely reduced diquark gap parameter,\nand the pairing quarks have different number densities. The latter contradicts the paring\nansatz in Ref. [124]. Therefore, one could suggest that this phase is an unstable Sarma\nstate [125]. In Ref. [87], it was shown that the N2SC phase is a stable state under the\nrestriction of the charge neutrality condition. As a by-product, which comes out as a very\nimportant feature, it was found that the quasi-particle spectrum has zero-energy excitation\nin this charge neutral two-flaovr color superconducting phase. Thus this phase was named\nthe \"gapless 2SC(g2SC)\" phase.\nIn the following of this section, firstly, using the method introduced in the previous\nsection, I will derive the thermodynamic potential for the charge neutral two-flavor quark\nsystem based on Ref. [121]. Then I discuss the ground state of the charge neutral two-flavor\nquark system and introduce the g2SC phase [87]. At last, I show the properties of the g2SC\nphase at zero as well as at nonzero temperatures [88], and the color screening properties [89]\nin the g2SC phase.\nA. Thermodynamic potential of the neutral two-flavor quark system\n\nWe consider the SU(2) NJL model by assuming that the strange quark does not appear\nin the system, and we only consider scalar, pseudoscalar mesons and scalar diquark. The\nLagrangian density has the same form as Eq. (2.1). As it was shown in Ref. [45,102], in\nthe color superconducting phase, the small quark mass due to the explicit chiral symmetry\nbreaking has little effect on the diquark condensate. Therefore, for simplicity, in this section,\nwe only consider the chiral limit case m0 = 0, and the parameters GS and \u039b in the chiral\nlimit are fixed as\nGS = 5.0163GeV\u22122 , \u039b = 0.6533GeV.\n\n(3.1)\n\nThe corresponding effective mass m = 0.314GeV, and we still choose GD as a free parameter\nwith the ratio \u03b7 = GD /GS .\nThe partition function of the grand canonical ensemble can be evaluated by using standard method [114,115],\nZ\nZ \u03b2 Z\n\u2032\n[dq\u0304][dq]exp{\nZ =N\nd\u03c4 d3 x (L\u0303 + \u03bcq\u0304\u03b30 q)},\n(3.2)\n0\n\nwhere \u03b2 = 1/T is the inverse of the temperature T , and \u03bc is the chemical potential.

This induces a mismatch between the Fermi surfaces of pairing\nquarks, i.e., \u03bcd \u2212 \u03bcu = \u03bce = 2\u03b4\u03bc, where \u03bce is the electron chemical potential.\nThe proper way to find the charge neutral ground state\nNow, we discuss the role of the electric charge neutrality condition. If a macroscopic\nchunk of quark matter has nonzero net electric charge density nQ , the total thermodynamic\npotential for the system should be given by\n\u03a9 = \u03a9Coulomb + \u03a9u,d,e ,\n\n(3.42)\n\nwhere \u03a9Coulomb \u223c n2Q V 2/3 (V is the volume of the system) is induced by the repulsive\nCoulomb interaction. The energy density grows with increasing the volume of the system, as a result, it is almost impossible for matter inside stars to remain charged over\nmacroscopic distances. So bulk quark matter must satisfy electric neutrality condition with\n\u03a9Coulomb |nQ =0 = 0, and \u03a9u,d,e |nQ =0 is on the neutrality line. Under the charge neutrality\ncondition, the total thermodynamic potential of the system is \u03a9|nQ =0 = \u03a9u,d,e |nQ =0 .\nHere, we want to emphasize that: The proper way to find the ground state of homogeneous\nneutral u, d quark matter is to minimize the thermodynamic potential along the neutrality\n33\n\n\f\u2206 ( MeV )\n200\n\n\u03b7=1.0\n\n175\n150\n125\n\n\u03b7=0.75\n\n= ( \u03bce(1) ,0)\n\n100\n= ( \u03bce(2) ,0.5 \u03bc(2)\ne )\n\n75\n50\n\n= (\u03be ,0)\n\n\u03b7=0.5\n\n= (2\u03be ,\u03be )\n\n25\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n\u03bc e ( MeV )\n400\n\nFIG. 6. The graphical representation of the solution to the charge neutrality conditions (thick\ndash-dotted line) and the solution to the gap equation for three different values of the diquark\ncoupling constant (thick solid and dashed lines). The intersection points represent the solutions\nto both. The thin solid line divides two qualitatively different regimes, \u2206 < \u03b4\u03bc and \u2206 > \u03b4\u03bc. The\nresults are plotted for \u03bc = 400 MeV and three values of diquark coupling constant GD = \u03b7GS with\n\u03b7 = 0.5, \u03b7 = 0.75, and \u03b7 = 1.0.\n\nline \u03a9|nQ =0 = \u03a9u,d,e |nQ =0 . This is different from that in the flavor asymmetric quark system,\nwhere \u03b2-equilibrium is required but \u03bce is a free parameter, and the ground state for flavor\nasymmetric quark matter is determined by minimizing the thermodynamic potential \u03a9u,d,e .\nFrom Fig. 5, we can see the difference in determining the ground state for a charge\nneutral system and for a flavor asymmetric system when \u03bce is a free parameter. In Fig. 5,\nat a given chemical potential \u03bc = 400 MeV and \u03b7 = GD /GS = 0.75, the thermodynamic\npotential along the charge neutrality line \u03a9|nQ =0 as a function of the diquark gap \u2206 is\nshown by the solid line. The minimum gives the ground state of the neutral system, and the\ncorresponding values of the chemical potential and the diquark gap are \u03bce = 148 MeV and\n\u2206 = 68 MeV, respectively. If we switch off the charge neutrality conditions, and consider\nthe flavor asymmetric u, d quark matter in \u03b2\u2212 equilibrium like in Refs. [128,129], the electric\nchemical potential \u03bce becomes a free parameter. At a fixed \u03bce = 148 MeV and with color\ncharge neutrality, the thermodynamic potential is shown as a function of the diquark gap\nby the dashed line in Fig. 5. The minimum gives the ground state of the flavor asymmetric\nsystem, and the corresponding diquark gap is \u2206 = 0, but this state has negative electric\ncharge density, and cannot exist in the interior of compact stars.\nGD dependent charge neutral ground state and the g2SC phase\nEquivalently, the neutral ground state can also be determined by solving the diquark gap\nequation Eq. (3.33) together with the charge neutrality conditions Eqs. (3.40) and (3.41),\nhere we regarded the quark mass is zero in the chiral symmetric phase.\nWe visualize this method in Fig. 6, with color neutrality always satisfied, at a given\nchemical potential \u03bc = 400 MeV.

It is found that for\neach \u03b7, the solution is divided into two branches by the thin-solid line \u2206 = \u03b4\u03bc, and the\nsolution is very sensitive to \u03b7. Also, there is always a trivial solution to the diquark gap\nequation, i.e., \u2206 = 0. The solution of the charge neutrality conditions is shown by a thick\ndash-dotted line, which is also divided into two branches by the thin-solid line \u2206 = \u03b4\u03bc, but\nthe solution of the charge neutrality is independent of \u03b7.\nThe cross-point of the solutions to the charge neutrality conditions and the diquark gap\ngives the solution of the system. We find that the neutral ground state is sensitive to the\ncoupling constant GD = \u03b7GS in the diquark channel. In the case of a very strong coupling\n(e.g., \u03b7 = 1.0 case), the charge neutrality line crosses the upper branch of the solution to\nthe diquark gap, the ground state is a charge neutral regular 2SC phase with \u2206 > \u03b4\u03bc. In\nthe case of weak coupling (e.g., \u03b7 = 0.5), the charge neutrality line crosses only the trivial\nsolution of the diquark gap, i.e., the ground state is a charge neutral normal quark matter\nwith \u2206 = 0.\nThe regime of intermediate coupling (see, e.g., \u03b7 = 0.75 case) is most interesting, the\ncharge neutrality line crosses the lower branch of the solution of the diquark gap. It should\nbe noticed that \u03b7 = 0.75 is from the Fierz transformation, and \u03b7 = 2.26/3 \u2243 0.75 obtained\nin the SU(2) NJL model in Ref. [106] from fitting the vacuum baryon mass. We will see\nthat in the regime of intermediate coupling, the phase with \u2206 < \u03b4\u03bc is a gapless 2SC (g2SC)\nphase.\nQuasi-particle spectrum\nAs we already mentioned that the pairing quarks have different number densities in the\ng2SC phase, which is different from the regular 2SC phase. It is the quasi-particle spectrum\nthat makes the g2SC phase different from the gapped 2SC phase.\nIt is instructive to start with the excitation spectrum in the case of the ideal 2SC phase\nwhen \u03b4\u03bc = 0. With the conventional choice of the gap pointing in the anti-blue direction in\nthe color space, the blue quarks are not affected by the pairing dynamics, and the other four\nquarsi-particle excitations are linear superpositions of ur,g and dr,g quarks and holes. The\nquasi-particle is nearly identical with a quark at large momenta and with a hole at small\nmomenta. We represent the quasi-particle in the form of Q(quark, hole), then the four\nquasi-particles can be represented explicitly as Q(ur , dg ), Q(ug , dr ), Q(dr , ug ) and Q(dg , ur ).\n35\n\n\fWhen \u03b4\u03bc = 0, the four quasi-particles are degenerate, and have a common gap \u2206. If there\nis a small mismatch (\u03b4\u03bc < \u2206) between the Fermi surfaces of the pairing u and d quarks, the\nexcitation spectrum will change. For example, we show the excitation spectrum of Q(ur , dg )\nand Q(dg , ur ) in the left panel of Fig. 7. We can see that \u03b4\u03bc induces two different dispersion\nrelations, the quasi-particle Q(dg , ur ) has a smaller energy gap \u2206\u2212\u03b4\u03bc, and the quasi-particle\nQ(ur , dg ) has a larger energy gap \u2206 + \u03b4\u03bc. This is similar to the case when the mismatch is\ninduced by the mass difference of the pairing quarks [130].\nIf the mismatch \u03b4\u03bc is larger than the gap parameter \u2206, the lower dispersion relation for\nthe quasi-particle Q(dg , ur ) will cross the zero-energy axis, as shown in the right panel of\nFig. 7. The energy of the quasi-particle\nQ(dg , ur ) vanishes at two values of momenta p = \u03bc\u2212\np\nand p = \u03bc+ where \u03bc\u00b1 \u2261 \u03bc\u0304 \u00b1 (\u03b4\u03bc)2 \u2212 \u22062 . Thus this phase is called the gapless 2SC (g2SC)\nphase.\nAn unstable gapless CFL phase has been found in Ref. [130], and a similar stable gapless\ncolor superconductivity could also appear in a cold atomic gas [131] or in u, s or d, s quark\nmatter when the number densities are kept fixed [132]. Also, some gapless phases may\nappear due to P-wave interactions in the cold atomic system [133].\nAs we shall see, the interplay of the neutrality condition and the solution to the gap\nequation produces some unusual properties of the g2SC phase that have no analogue in well\nknown systems.\nD. The g2SC phase at nonzero temperatures\n\nIn a superconducting system, when one increases the temperature at a given chemical\npotential, thermal motion will eventually break up the quark Cooper pairs. In the weakly\ninteracting Bardeen-Copper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, the transition between the superconducting and normal phases is usually of second order. The ratio of the critical temperature\nTcBCS to the zero temperature value of the gap \u2206BCS\nis a universal value [134]\n0\nrBCS\n\ne\u03b3E\nTcBCS\n= BCS =\n\u2248 0.567,\n\u03c0\n\u22060\n\n(3.43)\n\nwhere \u03b3E \u2248 0.577 is the Euler constant. In the conventional 2SC phase of quark matter with\nequal densities of the up and down quarks, the ratio of the critical temperature to the zero\ntemperature value of the gap is also the same as in the BCS theory [39]. In the spin-0 color\nflavor locked phase as well as in the spin-1 color spin locked phase, on the other hand, this\nratio is larger than BCS ratio by the factors 21/3 and 22/3 , respectively. These deviations are\nrelated directly to the presence of two different types of quasiparticles with nonequal gaps\n[65].\nThis commonly accepted picture of the finite temperature effects in superconducting\nphases changes drastically in the case of dense quark matter when the \u03b2-equilibrium and\nthe local neutrality conditions are enforced. Below, we study this in detail.\nGap equation and charge neutrality condition\nHere we consider the gap equation and charge neutrality conditions in the g2SC phase\nat finite temperature.

The solutions to the gap equation (solid lines) and the neutrality condition (dashed\nlines) calculated for several values of temperature. The results are plotted for \u03bc = 400 MeV and\nthe diquark coupling constant GD = \u03b7GS with \u03b7 = 0.75. In this case, Tc \u2248 50.2 MeV.\n\ntemperature, most of the results that follow will be obtained by numerical computation. It\nis important to keep in mind, however, that our approach remains conceptually the same as\nthat at zero temperature.\nBefore studying the gap equation (3.33), we recall that the right hand side of this equation\nis a function of the three chemical potentials \u03bc, \u03bce and \u03bc8 . The values of \u03bce and \u03bc8 are\nnot the free parameters in neutral quark matter. They are determined by satisfying the two\ncharge neutrality conditions. In our analysis, on the other hand, it is very convenient to\nenforce only the color charge neutrality by choosing the function \u03bc8 (\u03bc, \u03bce , \u2206) properly. As for\nthe electric chemical potential \u03bce , it is treated as an independent parameter at intermediate\nstages of calculation. Only at the very end its value is adjusted to make the quark matter\nalso electricly neutral.\nAs in the case of zero temperature, the resulting color chemical potential \u03bc8 is much\nsmaller than the other two chemical potentials in neutral quark matter. This, of course, is\nnot surprizing. Small nonzero values of \u03bc8 [typically, \u03bc8 \u223c \u22062 /\u03bc] are required only because\nan induced color charge of the diquark condensate should be compensated. Therefore,\nthe smallness of \u03bc8 is protected by the smallness of the order parameter. The numerical\ncalculations show, in fact, that even the approximation \u03bc8 = 0 does not modify considerably\nthe exact solutions to the gap equation and to the electric charge neutrality condition.\nIn practice, we either tabulate the function \u03bc8 (\u03bc, \u03bce , \u2206) for a given set of parameters, or\ndetermine it numerically in the vicinity of the ground state solution.\nThe solutions to the gap equation (3.33) for several different values of temperature (T =\n0, 20, 40, 50.2 and 60 MeV) are shown graphically in Fig. 8 (solid lines). The values of\nthe temperature are marked along the curves. The results are plotted in the (\u03bce ,\u2206)-plane.\nIn computation we kept the quark chemical potential fixed, \u03bc = 400 MeV, and used the\ndiquark coupling constant GD = \u03b7GS with \u03b7 = 0.75. This is the same choice that we used\nat zero temperature in Fig. 6.\nNow let us briefly discuss the temperature dependence of the solution. It is not very\n37\n\n\fsurprizing that the shape of the graphical solution is smoothed with increasing the temperature. The same applies to the disappearance of the double-branch structure of the solution\nat a finite value of the temperature, Ts \u2243 30 MeV. Indeed, in a model that treats the electric\nchemical potential as a free parameter, this value of the temperature Ts marks the expected\nswitch of two regimes. Namely, while the phase transition controlled by the \u03bce parameter\n(i.e., neutrality is not required) is a first order phase transition at T < Ts , it becomes a\nsecond order phase transition at T > Ts .\nWe also observe that the value of the electric chemical potential at the point where the\nsolution to the gap equation intersects with the \u03bce -axis has a nonmonotonic dependence on\nthe temperature. With increasing temperature, this value increases first and, after reaching\nsome maximum value, starts to decrease and goes down to zero eventually. When the\ninterplay with the neutrality condition is taken into account later, this simple property of\nthe solution would produce rather unusual physical results.\nWe note that the temperature dependence of the solutions to the gap equation is very\nsimilar to the dependence found by Sarma in a solid state physics analogue of the g2SC\nphase [125]. Of course, there was no analogue of the neutrality condition in the system\nstudied in Ref. [125]. Therefore, the mentioned similarity does not extend to the complete\nanalysis of the g2SC phase that follows.\nIn Fig. 8, we also show the neutrality lines (dashed lines) for the same values of temperature (T = 0, 20, 40, 50.2 and 60 MeV). The convention is that the lengths of the dashes\ndecreases with increasing the value of the temperature. As we see, with increasing temperature, the neutrality line gets steeper while its intersection point with the \u03bce -axis moves\ntowards larger values of \u03bce . The points of intersection of these neutrality lines with the lines\nof solutions to the gap equation, when they exist, are shown as well.\nAs in the case of zero temperature, see Fig. 5, we need to show that the points of\nintersections of the gap solutions with the corresponding neutrality lines in Fig. 8 represent\nthe ground state of the neutral quark matter. To this end, we calculate the dependence\nof the thermodynamic potential on the value of the gap \u2206. Since the charge neutrality\ncondition is satisfied only along the neutrality line, we restrict the thermodynamic potential\nonly to this line. The numerical results for several values of the temperature are shown in\nFig. 9.\nThe results at \u03bc = 400 MeV and \u03b7 = 0.75 show that, for any T < Tc \u2248 50.2 MeV, the\nthermodynamic potential has the global minimum away from the origin, meaning that the\ncorresponding ground state develops a nonzero expectation value of \u2206(T ). Needless to say\nthat this is the same value that one extracts from the geometrical construction in Fig. 8.\nThe expectation value \u2206(T ) disappears gradually when the temperature approaches Tc from\nbelow. This is an indication of the second order phase transition. At temperature higher\nthan Tc , the ground state of neutral quark matter is the normal phase with \u2206(T ) = 0.\nTemperature dependence of the gap\nThe temperature dependence of the gap is obtained by numerical solution of the gap\nequation (3.33) together with the two charge neutrality conditions. Of course, this is equivalent to the geometrical construction used in Fig. 8, where the intersection points of two\ntypes of lines determine the values of the gaps in the ground state.\n38\n\n\f- 80\n\nT=0\n\n\u03a9 ( MeV / fm3 )\n\nT=20\n- 100\nT=40\n- 120\nT=Tc\n- 140\nT=60\n50\n\n100\n\u2206 ( MeV )\n\n150\n\n200\n\nFIG. 9. The thermodynamic potential of neutral quark matter as a function of the diquark gap\n\u2206 calculated for several values of temperature.\n\nThe typical results for the default choice of parameters \u03bc = 400 MeV and \u03b7 = 0.75\nare shown in Fig. 10. Both the values of the diquark gap (solid line) and the mismatch\nparameter \u03b4\u03bc = \u03bce /2 (dashed line) are plotted. One very unusual property of the shown\ntemperature dependence of the gap is the nonmonotonic behavior. Only at sufficiently high\ntemperatures, the gap is a decreasing function. In the low temperature regime, T . 10 MeV,\nhowever, it increases with temperature. For comparison, in the same figure, the diquark gap\nin the model with \u03bce = 0 and \u03bc8 = 0 is also shown (dash-dotted line). This latter has the\nstandard BCS shape.\nAnother interesting thing regarding the temperature dependences in Fig. 10 appears in\nthe intermediate temperature regime, 22.5 . T . 37 MeV. By comparing the values of\n\u2206(T ) and \u03b4\u03bc in this regime, we see that the g2SC phase is replaced by a \"transitional\" 2SC\nphase there. Indeed, the energy spectrum of the quasiparticles even at finite temperature is\ndetermined by the same relations in Eqs. (3.27) and (3.29) that we used at zero temperature.\nWhen \u2206 > \u03b4\u03bc, the modes determined by Eq. (3.29) are gapped. Then, according to our\nstandard classification, the ground state is the 2SC phase.\nIt is fair to say, of course, that the qualitative difference of the g2SC and 2SC phases is not\nso striking at finite temperature as it is at zero temperature. This difference is particularly\nnegligible in the regime of interest where temperatures 22.5 . T . 37 MeV are considerably\nlarger than the actual value of the smaller gap, \u2206 \u2212 \u03b4\u03bc. By increasing the value of the\ncoupling constant slightly, however, the transitional 2SC phase can be made much stronger\nand the window of intermediate temperatures can become considerably wider. In either\ncase, we find it rather unusual that the g2SC phase of neutral quark matter is replaced by\na transitional 2SC phase at intermediate temperatures which, at higher temperatures, is\nreplaced by the g2SC phase again.\nIt appears that the temperature dependence of the diquark gap is very sensitive to the\nchoice of the diquark coupling strength \u03b7 = GD /GS in the model at hand. This is not\nsurprising because the solution to the gap equation is very sensitive to this choice.

For comparison, the diquark gap in the model with \u03bce = 0\nand \u03bc8 = 0 is also shown (dash-dotted line). The results are plotted for \u03bc = 400 MeV and \u03b7 = 0.75.\n\nresulting interplay of the solution for \u2206 with the condition of charge neutrality, however,\nis very interesting. This is demonstrated by the plot of the temperature dependence of the\ndiquark gap calculated for several values of the diquark coupling in Fig. 11.\nThe most amazing are the results for weak coupling. It appears that the gap function\ncould have sizable values at finite temperature even if it is exactly zero at zero temperature.\nThis possibility comes about only because of the strong influence of the neutrality condition\non the ground state preference in quark matter. Because of the thermal effects, the positive\nelectric charge of the diquark condensate is easier to accommodate at finite temperature.\nThis opens a possibility of the Cooper pairing that is forbidden at zero temperature.\nWe should mention that somewhat similar results for the temperature dependence of\nthe gap were also obtained in Ref. [135] in a study of the asymmetric nuclear matter and\nin Ref. [136] in superfluidity. This behavior can be easily understood: When the coupling strength is relatively weak, at zero temperature, it is very difficult to form a pair for\ntwo fermions at largely separating sharp Fermi surfaces. However, when the termperature\nincreases, the thermal excitations smooth the Fermi surfaces, thus offer the possibility for\nforming Cooper pairs. Of course, when the temperature is very high, the thermal excitations\nwill eventually destroy the Cooper pairs.\nNonuniversal ratio Tc /\u22060\nIn the preceding subsection, we saw that the temperature dependence of the gap in the\ng2SC phase is very different from the standard benchmark result in the BCS theory. One of\nthe main properties of the BCS temperature dependence is a universal value of the ratio of\nthe critical temperature Tc to the value of the gap at zero temperature \u22060 , see Eq. (3.43). It\nis instructive, therefore, to calculate the same quantity in the g2SC phase of neutral quark\nmatter.\nLet us start from a simple exercise, and consider the results plotted in Fig. 10 more\ncarefully. First of all, we find that Tc2SC \u2248 62.06 MeV and \u22062SC\n= 109.4 MeV when there is\n0\n40\n\n\f\u03b7=0.75\n60\n\n\u2206 ( MeV )\n\n\u03b7=0.70\n\u03b7=0.684\n\n40\n\n\u03b7=0.66\n20\n\n\u03b7=0.64\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\nT ( MeV )\n\n40\n\n50\n\nFIG. 11. The temperature dependence of the diquark gap in neutral quark matter calculated\nfor several values of the diquark coupling strength \u03b7 = GD /GS .\n\nno mismatch parameters in the model (i.e., \u03bce = 0 and \u03bc8 = 0 represented by dash-dotted\nline). It is not very surprizing that the ratio of interest r2SC \u2248 0.567 is in agreement with the\nBCS result. Now, if we check the results for the gap function in the g2SC phase (solid line),\nwe find that Tcg2SC \u2248 50.2 MeV and \u2206g2SC\n\u2248 68.2 MeV. Thus, the ratio is rg2SC \u2248 0.7357\n0\nwhich is considerably larger than the 2SC result.\nIt appears that the real situation is even more interesting. The result for the ratio\nrg2SC \u2248 0.7357 is not universal. In fact, its value depends very much on the diquark\ncoupling constant and, moreover, it can even be arbitrarily large. This last statement may\nnot be so unexpected if we recall the temperature dependences of the gap shown in Fig. 11.\nThe numerical results for the ratio of the critical temperature to the zero temperature\ngap in the g2SC case as a function of the diquark coupling strength \u03b7 = GD /GS are plotted\nin Fig. 12. The dependence is shown for the most interesting range of values of \u03b7 = GD /GS ,\n0.68 . \u03b7 . 0.81, which allows the g2SC stable ground state at zero temperature. When\nthe coupling gets weaker in this range, the zero temperature gap vanishes gradually. As we\nsaw from Fig. 11, however, this does not mean that the critical temperature vanishes too.\nTherefore, the ratio of a finite value of Tc to the vanishing value of the gap can become\narbitrarily large. In fact, it remains strictly infinite for a range of couplings.\nE. Chromomagnetic instability in the g2SC phase\n\nThe g2SC phase has four gapless modes and two gapped modes, one may think that the\nlow energy (large distance scale) properties in the g2SC phase should interpolate between\nthose in the normal phase and those in the 2SC phase. However, its color screening properties\ndo not fit this picture.\nAs we know, one of the most important properties of the ordinary superconductor is its\nMeissner effect, i.e., a superconductor expels the magnetic field, which was discovered by\nMeissner and Ochsenfeld in 1933 [35]. From theoretical point of view, the Messiner effect\n41\n\n\f3.\n2.5\n\nTc / \u22060\n\n2.\n1.5\n1.\nrBCS\n0.5\n\n0.7\n\n0.74\n\u03b7\n\n0.78\n\nFIG. 12. The ratio of the critical temperature to the zero temperature gap in neutral quark\nmatter as a function of the coupling strength \u03b7 = GD /GS .\n\ncan be explained using the linear response theory. The induced current jiind is related to the\nmagnetic field Aj by jiind = \u03a0ij Aj , where the response function \u03a0ij is the photon polarization\ntensor. The response function has two components, diamagnetic and paramagnetic part\n[137]. In the static and long-wavelength limit, for the normal metal, the paramagnetic\ncomponent cancels exactly the diamagnetic component. While in the superconducting phase,\nthe paramagnetic component is quenched by the energy gap and producing a net diamagnetic\nresponse. Thus the ordinary superconductor is a prefect diamagnet.\nIn color superconducting phases, the gluon self-energy (the response function to an external color field), has been investigated in the ideal 2SC phase [54] and in the CFL phase\n[59]. The results show that the gauge bosons connected with the broken generators obtain\nmasses in these phases, which indicate the Meissner screening effect in these phases.\nIt is very interesting to know the chromomagnetic property in the g2SC phase. We\nstudied the g2SC phase in the framework of the SU(2) NJL model, and the NJL model\nlacks gluons. As reflection of this, it possesses the global instead of gauged color symmetry.\nIn addition, there appear five Nambu-Goldstone (NG) bosons in the ground state of the\nmodel when the color symmetry is broken. In QCD, there is no room for such NG bosons.\nHowever, the NJL model can be thought of as the low energy theory of QCD in which\nthe gluons, as independent degrees of freedom, are integrated out. The gluons could be\nreintroduced back by gauging the color symmetry in the Lagrangian density of the NJL\nmodel, providing a semirigorous framework for studying the effect of the Cooper pairing on\nthe physical properties of gluons.\nThe existence of the g2SC phase can be regarded as a physical and model independent\nresult under the restriction of local charge neutrality condition, the order parameter for this\nphase is \u2206 < \u03b4\u03bc. In Ref. [89], we calculated the gluon self-energy in the g2SC phase. It\nis found that, in this phase, the symmetry broken gauge bosons have imaginary Meissner\nscreening masses, which is induced by the dominant paramagnetic contribution to the gluon\nself-energy. In condensed matter, this phenomenon is called the paramagnetic Meissner\n\n42\n\n\feffect(PME) [138], and has been observed in some high temperature superconductors and\nsmall superconductors.\nUnavoidably, the imaginary Meissner screening mass indicates a chromomagnetic instability of the g2SC phase. There are several possibilities to resolve this instability. One is\nthrough a gluon condensate to stabilize the system, which may not change the structure of\nthe g2SC phase. It is also possible that the instability drives a new stable ground state,\nwhich may have a rotational symmetry breaking like in Refs. [139,140], or even have an\ninhomogeneous phase structure, like a crystal [68\u201370] or a vortex [141] structure. In the\nfuture, one has to resolve this problem.\nIV. THE MIXED PHASE AND NONSTRANGE HYBRID STAR\n\nWe have discussed the homogeneous two-flavor quark matter when charge neutrality\nconditions are satisfied locally, and found that the local charge neutrality conditions impose\nvery strong constraints on determining the ground state of the system. In this section, we\nare going to discuss the mixed phase and the nonstrange hybrid star based on Ref. [142].\nA. The mixed phase\n\nWhen charge neutrality conditions are satisfied globally, one can construct a mixed phase\n[142\u2013144]. Inside mixed phases, the charge neutrality is satisfied \"on average\" rather than\nlocally. This means that different components of mixed phases may have nonzero densities\nof conserved charges, but the total charge of all components still vanishes. In this case, one\nsays that the local charge neutrality condition is replaced by a global one. There are three\npossible components: (i) normal phase, (ii) 2SC phase, and (iii) g2SC phase.\nThe pressure of the main three phases of two-flavor quark matter as a function of the\nbaryon and electric chemical potentials is shown in Fig. 13 at \u03b7 = 0.75. In this figure, we\nalso show the pressure of the neutral normal quark and gapless 2SC phases (two dark solid\nlines). The surface of the g2SC phase extends only over a finite range of the values of \u03bce .\nIt merges with the pressure surfaces of the normal quark phase (on the left) and with the\nordinary 2SC phase (on the right).\nIt is interesting to notice that the three pressure surfaces in Fig. 13 form a characteristic\nswallowtail structure. As one could see, the appearance of this structure is directly related to\nthe fact that the phase transition between color superconducting and normal quark matter,\nwhich is driven by changing parameter \u03bce , is of first order. In fact, one should expect\nthe appearance of a similar swallowtail structure also in a self-consistent description of the\nhadron-quark phase transition. Such a description, however, is possible.\nFrom Fig. 13, one could see that the surfaces of normal and 2SC quark phases intersect\nalong a common line. This means that the two phases have the same pressure along this\nline, and therefore could potentially co-exist. Moreover, as is easy to check, normal quark\nmatter is negatively charged, while 2SC quark matter is positively charged on this line.\nThis observation suggests that the appearance of the corresponding mixed phase is almost\ninevitable.\n\n43\n\n\f\u03bce\n0.2\n0.1\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\nP\n\n0.1\n\n0.4\n\n\u03bc\n0.45\n\nFIG. 13. At \u03b7 = 0.75, pressure as a function of \u03bc \u2261 \u03bcB /3 and \u03bce for the normal and color\nsuperconducting quark phases. The dark solid lines represent two locally neutral phases: (i) the\nneutral normal quark phase on the left, and (ii) the neutral gapless 2SC phase on the right. The\nappearance of the swallowtail structure is related to the first order type of the phase transition in\nquark matter.\n\nLet us start by giving a brief introduction into the general method of constructing mixed\nphases by imposing the Gibbs conditions of equilibrium [145,146]. From the physical point\nof view, the Gibbs conditions enforce the mechanical as well as chemical equilibrium between\ndifferent components of a mixed phase. This is achieved by requiring that the pressure of\ndifferent components inside the mixed phase are equal, and that the chemical potentials (\u03bc\nand \u03bce ) are the same across the whole mixed phase. For example, in relation to the mixed\nphase of normal and 2SC quark matter, these conditions read\nP (N Q) (\u03bc, \u03bce ) = P (2SC) (\u03bc, \u03bce),\n\u03bc = \u03bc(N Q) = \u03bc(2SC) ,\nQ)\n\u03bce = \u03bc(N\n= \u03bce(2SC) .\ne\n\n(4.1)\n(4.2)\n(4.3)\n\nIt is easy to visualize these conditions by plotting the pressure as a function of chemical\npotentials (\u03bc and \u03bce ) for both components of the mixed phase. This is shown in Fig. 14. As\nshould be clear, the above Gibbs conditions are automatically satisfied along the intersection\nline of two pressure surfaces (dark solid line in Fig. 14).\nDifferent components of the mixed phase occupy different volumes of space. To describe\nthis quantitatively, we introduce the volume fraction of normal quark matter as follows:\nQ\nA\n\u03c7N\n2SC \u2261 VN Q /V (notation \u03c7B means volume fraction of phase A in a mixture with phase\nNQ\nB). Then, the volume fraction of the 2SC phase is given by \u03c72SC\nN Q = (1 \u2212 \u03c72SC ). From the\nQ\ndefinition, it is clear that 0 \u2264 \u03c7N\n2SC \u2264 1.\nThe average electric charge density of the mixed phase is determined by the charge\ndensities of its components taken in the proportion of the corresponding volume fractions.\nThus,\n44\n\n\f0.2\n\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\nP\n\n0.25\n0.2\n\n0.05\n\n0.15\n\u03bce\n\n0.1\n\n0.45\n0.4\n\n0.05\n0.35\n0\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\nFIG. 14.

Otherwise, a neutral mixed phase could not exist.\nIn the case of quark matter, the charge density of the normal quark phase is negative, while\nthe charge density of the 2SC phase is positive along the line of the Gibbs construction (dark\nsolid line in Fig. 14). Therefore, a neutral mixed phase may exist. The volume fractions of\nits components are\n(2SC)\n\nQ\n\u03c7N\n2SC =\n\nne\n(2SC)\n\nne\n\n(N Q)\n\n\u2212 ne\n\nNQ\n\u03c72SC\nN Q \u2261 1 \u2212 \u03c72SC =\n\n,\n\n(4.5)\n(N Q)\n\nne\n(N Q)\n\nne\n\n(2SC)\n\n\u2212 ne\n\n.\n\n(4.6)\n\nAfter the volume fractions have been determined from the condition of the global charge\nneutrality, we could also calculate the energy density of the corresponding mixed phase,\nQ (N Q)\nQ\n(2SC)\n\u03b5(M P ) = \u03c7N\n(\u03bc, \u03bce ) + (1 \u2212 \u03c7N\n(\u03bc, \u03bce ).\n2SC \u03b5\n2SC )\u03b5\n\n(4.7)\n\nThis is essentially all that we need in order to construct the equation of state of the mixed\nphase.\nSo far, we were neglecting the effects of the Coulomb forces and the surface tension\nbetween different components of the mixed phase. In a real system, however, these are\n45\n\n\fimportant. In particular, the balance between the Coulomb forces and the surface tension\ndetermines the size and geometry of different components inside the mixed phase.\nIn our case, nearly equal volume fractions of the two quark phases are likely to form\nalternating layers (slabs) of matter. The energy cost per unit volume to produce such layers\n(2SC)\n(N Q)\nscales as \u03c3 2/3 (ne\n\u2212 ne )2/3 where \u03c3 is the surface tension [147]. Therefore, the quark\nmixed phase is a favorable phase of matter only if the surface tension is not too large. Our\nsimple estimates show that \u03c3max \u2264 20 MeV/fm2 . However, even for slightly larger values,\n20 \u2264 \u03c3 \u2264 50 MeV/fm2 , the mixed phase is still possible, but its first appearance would occur\nat larger densities, 3\u03c10 \u2264 \u03c1B \u2264 5\u03c10 . The value of the maximum surface tension obtained\nhere is comparable to the estimate in the case of the hadronic-CFL mixed phase obtained\n(2SC)\n(N Q)\nin Ref. [148]. The thickness of the layers scales as \u03c3 1/3 (ne\n\u2212 ne )\u22122/3 [147], and its\ntypical value is of order 10 fm in the quark mixed phase. This is similar to the estimates in\nvarious hadron-quark and hadron-hadron mixed phases [147,148]. While the actual value of\nthe surface tension in quark matter is not known, in this study we assume that it is not very\nlarge. Otherwise, the homogeneous gapless 2SC phase should be the most favorable phase\nof nonstrange quark matter [87].\nUnder the assumptions that the effect of Coulomb forces and the surface tension is small,\nthe mixed phase of normal and 2SC quark matter is the most favorable neutral phase of\nmatter in the model at hand with \u03b7 = 0.75. This should be clear from observing the pressure\nsurfaces in Figs. 13 and 14. For a given value of the baryon chemical potential \u03bc = \u03bcB /3,\nthe mixed phase is more favorable than the gapless 2SC phase, while the gapless 2SC phase\nis more favorable than the neutral normal quark phase.\nB. Nonstrange hybrid star\n\nIn order to construct a neutron star, we need to know the equation of state from very\nlow baryon density to very high baryon density. Unfortunately, currently there is no single\nmodel that can describe the whole bayron density regime very successfully. In the following,\nwe use a QCD-motivated hadronic chiral SU(3)L \u00d7SU(3)R model in normal baryon density\nregime, and use the NJL model in the quark phase.\nHadronic matter\nAt densities around normal nuclear matter density \u03c10 \u2248 0.15 fm\u22123 , the description of\nbaryonic matter in terms of quarks could hardly be adequate. At such low densities, quarks\nare confined inside hadrons. Thus, it is more natural to use an effective hadronic model.\nWe use a QCD-motivated hadronic chiral SU(3)L \u00d7SU(3)R model as an effective theory of\nstrong interactions to describe the low density regime of the baryonic matter [149\u2013151]. This\nmodel was found to describe reasonably well the hadronic masses of various SU(3) multiplets,\nfinite nuclei, hypernuclei, excited nuclear matter and neutron star properties [149\u2013151].\nThe basic features of the chiral model are: (i) Lagrangian of the model is constructed in\naccordance with the nonlinear realization of the chiral SU(3)L \u00d7SU(3)R symmetry; (ii) heavy\nbaryons and mesons get their masses as a result of spontaneous symmetry breaking; (iii)\nthe masses of pseudoscalar mesons (pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons) result from an explicit\nsymmetry breaking; (iv) a QCD-motivated field that describes the gluon condensate (dilaton\n46\n\n\f4\n\n0.08\n\nA\nAU\n\n\u0003\n\n0.25\n\n0.06\nP\n\nAAU\n\n0.04\n\n0.2\n0.02\n0.15\n0.1\n\n0.4\n\n\u03bce\n\n0.375\n0.35 \u03bc\n\n0.05\n\n0.325\n0\n\nFIG. 15.

The dark thick line follows the neutrality line in\nhadronic matter, and two mixed phases: (i) the mixed phase of hadronic and normal quark matter;\nand (ii) the mixed phase of normal and color superconducting quark matter.\n\nfield) is introduced.\nThe mixed phase of hadronic matter and quark matter\nIt is expected that the phase transition between the hadronic phase and the normal\nquark phase is a first order phase transition at zero temperature and finite baryon chemical\npotential. Then, the hadronic and quark phases could co-exist in a mixed phase [145,146].\nThis mixed phase should satisfy the Gibbs conditions of equilibrium which are similar to\nthose discussed in the previous section, see Eqs. (4.1)\u2013(4.3). The total energy density in the\nhadron-quark mixed phase is given by\nQ (N Q)\nQ (H)\n\u03b5(M P ) = \u03c7N\n(\u03bc, \u03bce ) + (1 \u2212 \u03c7N\n(\u03bc, \u03bce ),\nH \u01eb\nH )\u01eb\n\n(4.8)\n\nQ\nwhere \u03c7N\ndenotes the volume fraction of normal quark matter inside a mixture with\nH\nhadronic matter.\nTo visualize the Gibbs construction of the hadron-quark mixed phase, we plot the\nhadronic surface of the pressure along with the quark surfaces discussed in the previous\nsection. Thus, Fig. 14 is replaced by Fig. 15. The new figure shows the surfaces of the\npressure of the pure hadronic and quark phases as a function of their chemical potentials\n\u03bc and \u03bce . The intersection lines of different surfaces indicate all potentially viable mixed\nphase constructions. Although the Gibbs conditions are satisfied along all these lines, not\n\n47\n\n\fall of them could produce globally neutral phases (e.g., there are no neutral constructions\nalong the light shaded solid lines in Fig. 15).\nThe dark solid line gives the complete, most favorable construction of globally neutral\nmatter in general \u03b2-equilibrium. This line consists of three pieces. The lowest part of\nthe curve (up to the point denoted by \u0003 and P . 10 MeV/fm3 ) corresponds to the pure\nconfined hadronic phase. Within this regime matter is mostly composed of neutrons with\nlittle fractions of protons and electrons to realize the charge neutrality and \u03b2-equilibrium.\nThe hyperonic particles (\u039b, \u03a3 and \u039e) are not present in this lowest density regime. Such\nparticles would appear in the hadronic phase at considerably higher values of pressure and\ndensity.\nThe mixed phase of hadronic and normal quark matter starts at the baryonic density\n\u03c1B \u2248 1.49\u03c10 which corresponds to the \u0003-point in Fig. 15. At this point the first bubbles of\ndeconfined quark matter appear in the system. At the beginning of this hadron-quark mixed\nphase, the deconfined bubbles are small but highly negatively charged, whereas hadronic\nmatter, in which the bubbles are embedded, is slightly positively charged. The global charge\nneutrality condition reads\nQ (N Q)\nQ\nP)\n(H)\nn(M\n\u2261 \u03c7N\n(\u03bc, \u03bce ) + (1 \u2212 \u03c7N\ne\nH ne\nH )ne (\u03bc, \u03bce ) = 0.\n(H)\n\n(4.9)\n\n(N Q)\n\nwhere ne and ne\nare the charge densities of hadronic and normal quark matter, respectively. This condition should be satisfied at each point along the middle part of the dark\nsolid line (i.e., between the points denoted by \u0003 and \u25b3). With increasing density (from\nabout 1.49\u03c10 up to 2.56\u03c10 ), the volume fraction of hadronic matter decreases (down to about\n0.59), while the fraction of normal quark matter increases (up to about 0.41).\nEquation of state\nThe equations of state for quark and hybrid matter are shown in Fig. 16. The first\nequation of state corresponds to globally neutral quark matter which is a mixture of the\nnormal quark and 2SC phases. As for the equation of state of hybrid matter, it is constructed\nout of the equation of state of neutral hadronic matter and two Gibbs constructions in\naccordance with Fig. 15. As before, the points that indicate the beginning of two different\nmixed phases are denoted by \u0003 and \u25b3 in Fig. 16.\nMass-radius relation for hybrid star\nThe mass-radius relations for hybrid and pure quark stars are shown in Fig. 17. As one\nwould expect, the pure quark stars composed of the mixed phase have much smaller radii\nand the value of their maximum mass is slightly smaller, see Fig. 17. Our results for pure\nquark stars are comparable to those in Refs. [122,152]. The difference between hybrid and\npure quark stars is mostly due to the low density part of the equation of state. This is also\nevident from the qualitative difference in the dependence of the radius as a function of mass\nfor the hybrid and quark stars with low masses. The corresponding hybrid stars are large\nbecause of a sizable low density hadronic layer, while the quark stars are small because that\nhave no such layers.\nHere we use a two-flavor version of the NJL model to describe the deconfined phase.\nHowever, the three-flavor extension of the NJL model in Ref. [120] suggests that strange\n48\n\n\fhybrid matter\nquark matter\n\nFIG. 16. The equation of state for globally neutral hybrid matter (solid line) and globally\nneutral quark matter (dashed line).

CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK\n\nThis article focuses on the two-flavor color superconducting phase at moderate baryon\ndensity.\nIn order to simultaneously investigate the chiral phase transition and the color superconducting phase transition, the Nambu-Gorkov formalism has been extended to treat the\nquark-antiquark and diquark condensates on an equal footing, and the competition between\nthe chiral and diquark condensates has been investigated.\nDense u, d quark matter under local and global charge neutrality conditions in \u03b2equilibrium has been discussed in detail. Under the local charge neutrality condition, the\nhomogeneous neutral ground state is sensitive to the coupling constant in the diquark channel, it will be in the regular 2SC phase when the diquark coupling is strong, in the normal\nphase when the diquark coupling is weak, and in the g2SC phase in the case of intermediate\ndiquark coupling. The low energy quasi-particle spectrum of the g2SC phase contains four\ngapless modes and only two gapped modes. In the intermediate diquark coupling regime,\nunder global charge neutrality condition, assuming that the effect of Coulomb forces and the\nsurface tension is small, one can construct a mixed phase composed of a positive charged\n2SC phase and a negative charged normal quark phase. It will be valuable to compare the\nhomogeneous g2SC phase and the mixed phase, and give a clear answer to which phase is\npreferable.\nEven though the regime of the diquark coupling strength for the existence of the g2SC\nphase is rather narrow, i.e., 0.7 . \u03b7 . 0.8, it is noticed that the value \u03b7 = 0.75 from\nFierz transformation and also the value \u03b7 \u2243 2.26/3 from fitting the baryon vacuum mass,\nare inside this regime. The g2SC has rather unusual properties at zero as well as at finite\ntemperature, and its chromomagnetic properties are extremely surprising. The paramagnetic\nMeissner effect indicates a chromomagnetic instability in the g2SC phase. In the near\nfuture, we need to resolve the problem of the chromomagnetic instability in the g2SC phase,\nand to investigate whether the chromomagnetic instability will drive a new inhomogeneous\nstructure.\nIn this article, I only discussed the two-flavor quark system. In the moderate baryon\ndensity regime \u03bc \u2243 500MeV, the strange quark may appear in the system. The cold dense\nthree-flavor quark system has a more complicated and more interesting phase structure.\nIn different conditions, the three-flavor quark system can be in one of the phases of CFL,\nCFL+K, CFL+\u03b7, gCFL, and dSC [78,79,86,90\u201394]. It is, of course, very interesting and\nalso challenging to investigate all these phases in one self-consistent framework. For the\ncharge neutral gCFL phase, it is very attractive to know whether there is chromomagnetic\ninstability.\nIn our calculations, we used the mean-field approximation. It is very interesting to see\nhow the diquark fluctuation will affect the results. It should be noticed that till now, we are\nusing the BCS scenario even in the intermediate baryon density regime. From the experience\nin condensed matter, the BCS scenario only works when the attractive interaction is very\n50\n\n\fweak, where the Cooper pairs are loosely bound states. While with the increasing of the coupling strength, the Cooper pairs become tightly bounded, the fluctuation from the Cooper\npairs cannot be neglected. In the strong coupling case, the Cooper pairs become real bound\nsates in the coordinates space, and a Fermion system transfers to a boson system. The\nboson system may experience the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). This is the basic idea\nof the crossover from BCS to BEC [154,155]. The fluctuation of the gauge fields as well as\nof the diquark were investigated in Refs. [156,157], and it will be very interesting to see how\nthe Cooper pair structure [158] changes when fluctuations are considered. In addition to the\ndiquark fluctuation, the quark-antiquark fluctuation may also need to be considered in the\nintermediate baryon density regime. It was found in Ref. [159] that the quark-antiquark fluctuation has significant influence on the chiral phase transition. When the quark-antiquark\nfluctuation is considered self-consistently [160], the critical baryon density for the chiral\nphase transition becomes much larger than that in the mean-field approximation.\nThe most interesting thing in the field of color superconductivity, of course, is to look\nfor this phase in the nature or to create this phase in the laboratory. There are already\nsome work to find the possibility of the existence of the color superconducting phase inside\nthe neutron star, like the mass-radius relation [122,142,152,153] and the cooling history\n[161]. The energy release from a hadronic star to a color superconducting star may relate\nto the supernovae or the gamma-ray burst [162]. About the possibility of creation color\nsuperconductivity in heavy-ion collisions, the work is in progress [163]. Nevertheless, we are\njust at the very beginning of this field, and there is still a long way to go.\nVI.

A color triplet diquark\nstate is antisymmetric under the exchange of colors, due to the Pauli principle, the matrices\nCK a \u03bbF must be totally symmetric. Thus the axial-vector and scalar diquark currents transform according to antisymmetric flavor 3\u0304 representation, whereas the scalar-, pseudoscalarand vector-diquarks are necessarily flavor sextetes.\nAPPENDIX B: CHARGE CONJUGATION\n\nCharge conjugation is conventionally defined to take a fermion with a given spin orientation into an antifermion with the same spin orientation.\n54\n\n\fThe charge-conjugated filed \u03c8 C is defined by\n\u03c8 C (x) = C \u03c8\u0304 T (x), \u03c8\u0304 C (x) = \u03c8 T C,\n\u03c8(x) = C \u03c8\u0304 CT (x), \u03c8\u0304(x) = \u03c8 CT (x)C,\n\n(B1)\n\nwhere C = i\u03b3 2 \u03b3 0 is the charge-conjugation matrix in the Dirac representation,\nC = \u2212C \u22121 = \u2212C T = \u2212C \u2020 ,\n\n(B2)\n\nC\u03b3 \u03bc C \u22121 = \u2212(\u03b3 \u03bc )T .\n\n(B3)\n\nand\n\nThe charge conjugation of bilinears is a little tricky, and it helps to write in spinor indices.\nFor the scalar,\n\u03c8\u0304 C \u03c8 C = \u03c8\u0304\u03b1C \u03c8\u03b1C\n= (\u03c8 T C)\u03b1 (C \u03c8\u0304 T )\u03b1\n= \u03c8\u03bb C\u03bb\u03b1 C\u03b1\u03bb\u2032 \u03c8\u0304\u03bb\u2032\n= \u03c8\u0304\u03c8.\n\n(B4)\n\nIn the last step, the fermion anticommunication and CC = \u22121 have been used.\nFor the vector,\n\u03c8\u0304 C \u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8 C = \u03c8\u0304\u03b1C (\u03b3 \u03bc )\u03b1\u03b2 \u03c8\u03b2C\n= (\u03c8 T C)\u03b1 (\u03b3 \u03bc )\u03b1\u03b2 (C \u03c8\u0304 T )\u03b2\n= \u03c8\u03bb C\u03bb\u03b1 (\u03b3 \u03bc )\u03b1\u03b2 C\u03b2\u03bb\u2032 \u03c8\u0304\u03bb\u2032\n= \u03c8\u03bb (\u03b3 \u03bc )T\u03bb\u03bb\u2032 \u03c8\u0304\u03bb\u2032\n= \u2212\u03c8\u0304\u03bb\u2032 (\u03b3 \u03bc )\u03bb\u2032 \u03bb \u03c8\u03bb\n= \u2212\u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8.\n\n(B5)\n\nFor the kinetic term,\n\u03c8\u0304 C \u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c8 C = \u2212(\u2202\u03bc \u03c8\u0304)\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8,\n\n(B6)\n\n\u2202\u03bc (\u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8) = (\u2202\u03bc \u03c8\u0304)\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8 + \u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc (\u2202\u03bc \u03c8),\n\n(B7)\n\nusing\n\nand the vector current conservation, we have\n\u03c8\u0304 C \u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c8 C = \u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c8.\n\n55\n\n(B8)\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] D.J.
