In the case with broken\naxial symmetry, two transitions occurs consecutively as increasing the field: hc = (m1 m2 )1/2 (with\nm1 and m2 the transverse masses) is the critical Ising point and h\u0303\u2217c (> hc ) is the commensurateincommensurate transition point. Although the latter is thermodynamically indiscernible, its property is revealed in the spin correlation functions (both uniform and staggered) which are calculated\nupon expressing the correlations of coupled Ising pair fields in terms of block-Toeplitz determinants.\nPACS numbers: 75.10.Pq, 75.40.-s, 75.30.Gw, 71.10.Pm\n\nIt is now well established that a one-dimensional (1D)\nquantum antiferromagnet with spin-1 possesses a (Haldane) gap in the excitation spectrum which separates the\nfirst excited triplet states from the singlet ground state\n[1]. The elementary excitations are coherent antiferromagnetic massive magnons appearing around q = \u03c0 and\ncarrying quantum number S = 1. If an external magnetic\nfield is introduced into the Haldane system, the transverse modes couple to the field and phase transition may\noccur when the field overcomes the gap [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].\nExperimentally, there have indeed been observed phase\ntransitions in some quasi-1D compounds by measuring\nthermodynamic quantities such as magnetization [7, 8, 9]\nand specific heat [9, 10], as well as neutron scattering\npeak [7, 11, 12].\nFor an isotropic chain or the field applied having axial symmetry, a commensurate-incommensurate (C-IC)\ntransition [13] takes place when the field surpasses the\ntransverse mass, and the system enters the massless Luttinger liquid phase. Physically, this is understood in either bosonic [2, 6] or fermionic language [3]. In the former\ndescription, the transition is associated with the condensation of the bosons; while in the latter, the fermions\nbegin to fill the conduction band when the field (as chemical potential) exceeds the gap. Aside from magnetization, the external field induces a planar quasi-long-range\norder in the staggered spin correlations. The correlation\nfunctions in the Luttinger liquid phase have also been\ncalculated [6]. However, in most real materials the spin\nrotational symmetry is hardly preserved in presence of\nsingle-ion anisotropies, and thus the triplet masses are at\nleast slightly different. Considering the Luttinger liquid\nrequires a U(1) symmetry and cannot survive a broken\naxial symmetry, in a general asymmetric case, the phase\ntransition reduces to be of Ising-type [2]. In this Letter,\nwe report the results for the Ising scenario, in particular,\nthe spin correlation functions in all phases.\nWe take a field-theoretic model due to Tsvelik\n[3]\nHaldane\nchain: HS (x) =\n\u0001\nP for theiv anisotropic\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1 \u03b1\n\u03be\n\u2202\n\u03be\n\u2212\n\u03be\n\u2202\n\u03be\n\u2212\nim\n[\u2212\n\u03b1 \u03beR \u03beL ], where v\nR x R\nL x L\n\u03b1=1,2,3\n2\nis the characteristic velocity of magnons, and the triplet\n\n\u03be\u03bd = (\u03be\u03bd1 , \u03be\u03bd2 , \u03be\u03bd3 ) are chiral (\u03bd = R, L) Majorana (real)\nfermion fields. The masses, m\u03b1 (> 0), are considered as phenomenological parameters accounting for the\nanisotropy. Although the neglected marginal currentcurrent interactions are essential to give rise to field dependent exponents in the Luttinger liquid phase, their\nrole is exhausted in the Ising transition case by renormalizing the masses and velocity. Since the system is now\nmassive everywhere except right at the critical point, the\neffect of interactions is at most shift the transition point\nwithout changing the universal property significantly. In\nthis representation, the spin density, as a sum of uniform\nand staggered parts, is expressed as S = I + (\u22121)n \u03b3N\n(\u03b3 being a constant). The uniform part I = I R + I L\nwith the chiral currents I \u03bd = \u2212 2i \u03be \u03bd \u00d7\u03be\u03bd satisfying the\nSU(2)2 Kac-Moody algebra and having the scaling dimensions (0, 1)/(1, 0) for \u03bd = R/L. The staggered part is\nassociated with the primary field with scaling dimension\n3\n3\n, 16\n): N = (\u03c31 \u03bc2 \u03bc3 , \u03bc1 \u03c32 \u03bc3 , \u03bc1 \u03bc2 \u03c33 ), where \u03c3\u03b1 and\n( 16\n\u03bc\u03b1 are, respectively, order and disorder Ising variables.\nThe magnetic field coupling to the uniform spin density contributes a \u0001Zeeman energy as HM (x) = hI z (x) =\n1 2\n\u2212ih \u03beR\n\u03beR + \u03beL1 \u03beL2 , which apparently only mixes first\ntwo (transverse) species of Majoranas, and the third one\ndrops out of the system as a free massive Majorana, or\nequivalently, off-critical Ising model. Therefore, we need\nonly concentrate on the Hamiltonian\nH(x) =\n\ni\n\u0001\niv \u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1 \u03b1\n\u03beR \u2202x \u03beR\n\u2212 \u03beL\u03b1 \u2202x \u03beL\u03b1 \u2212 im\u03b1 \u03beR\n\u03beL\n2\n\u03b1=1,2\n\u0001\n1 2\n(1)\n\u2212ih \u03beR\n\u03beR + \u03beL1 \u03beL2 .\nX h\n\n\u2212\n\nDenoting m = 21 (m1 + m2 ) and \u2206 = 21 (m1 \u2212 m2 ) and\ncombining two Majoranas into a Dirac fermion, model\n(1) actually describes a charge density wave-Cooper\npairing-chemical potential (m-\u2206-h) system in 1D. When\nbosonized, it becomes a sine-Gordon model with extra\nterms of dual field and field derivative.\nWhile the uniform spin correlations are easy to compute, it is not the case for the staggered part, since they\nare composed of Ising order and disorder fields, which are\n\n\f2\nrelated to the Majorana fermions in a highly non-trivial\nway (Jordan-Wigner transformation). To exploit the full\nadvantage of the solvableness of the model, we regularize\n(1) on a 1D lattice, on which the relations between the\nIsing variables and the fermions can be unambiguously\nestablished. By using the relations between the Majorana fields and the lattice Dirac fermion:\nn \u03beR \u2192 \u2212 \u221a1 (ei\u03c0/4 c\u2020 + e\u2212i\u03c0/4 cn ) ,\nn\n2a\n\u03beL \u2192 + \u221a12a (e\u2212i\u03c0/4 c\u2020n + ei\u03c0/4 cn ) ,\n\n(2)\n\nwe have the following lattice version of two coupled quantum Ising chains (QICs) (or m-\u2206-h model):\nX\n[b]\n[a]\nH = HQIC + HQIC \u2212 ih\n(a\u2020n bn \u2212 b\u2020n an ) ,\n(3)\nn\n\n[c]\nHQIC\n\nJ\n2\n\nP\n\ncn )(c\u2020n+1\n\n\u2020\nn [(cn\n\n+ cn+1 ) \u2212 \u03bbc (c\u2020n \u2212\nmc\nv\na and \u03bbc = 1 + J\n\nwhere\n=\n\u2212\n\u2020\ncn )(cn + cn )] with parameters J =\n(c = (1, 2) = (a, b)). Without loss of generality, we assume\nm1 \u2265 m2 > 0 (so that m > \u2206 \u2265 0 and \u03bb > 1) and h \u2265 0\nunless otherwise stated. The units are so chosen that\nJ = a = 1.\nModel (3) is diagonalized through a unitary transformation and the spectrum is found to be\nEk\u00b1 = \u03982k \u00b1 2\u03932k\n\n\u00011/2\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\n\u00011/2\nwhere \u03982k = \u039b2k + \u22062 + h2 and \u03932k = \u22062 \u01eb2k + h2 \u039b2k\nwith\n\u039b2k = \u01eb2k + sin2 k and \u01ebk = cos k \u2212 \u03bb. There exist totally six\n(real) correlation functions for the fermions:\nC1c (n) = hc\u2020n c0 i ,\nC3 (n) = iha\u2020n b0 i ,\n\nC2c (n) = hc\u2020n c\u20200 i ,\n\n(5)\n\nThe explicit forms of these correlations are obtained in\na variational approach, and all of them are 1D integrations over momentum. To calculate the correlations of\nthe coupled Ising fields, we need further\na,b\na,b\nGa,b\n(real)\nn = \u2212\u03b4n0 + 2[C1 (n) \u2212 C2 (n)] ,\nFn = 2i[C3 (n) \u2212 C4 (n)] .\n(imaginary)\n\n(6)\n\nAs is well-known, the correlation functions of the QIC\ncan be expressed as the so-called Toeplitz determinants.\nA Toeplitz matrix has its elements parallel to the diagonal the same value, i.e., it takes the form T\u0302 = [fT (i \u2212 j)].\nWe find that for the two QICs coupled in the present\nfashion, the correlation of a pair of Ising fields can be\ncast into a block-Toeplitz form with a doubled size. To\nthis purpose, we introduce following seven r\u00d7r Toeplitz\nmatrices:\na,b\n\u011ca,b\n\u03c3 (r) = [\u2212Gi\u2212j+1 ] ,\n\na,b\n\u011ca,b\n\u03bc (r) = [Gi\u2212j ] ,\n\nF\u0302\u03c3 (r) = [\u2212Fi\u2212j+1 ] ,\nF\u0304\u02c6 (r) = [\u2212F\n],\n\nF\u0302\u03bc (r) = [Fi\u2212j ] ,\n\n\u03c3\n\n\u2212i+j\u22121\n\nWith all these provisions, the spin correlations are\nreadily obtained.\nFor the uniform part, SI\u03b1 (r) \u2261\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nhI (n)I (n + r)i:\n\u0002\n\u0003\nSIx,y (r) = \u03b4r0 C1b,a (0) + C1c (0)\n\u22122C1b,a (r)C1c (r) \u2212 2C2b,a (r)C2c (r) ,\n\u0002\n\u0003\nSIz (r) = \u03b4r0 C1a (0) + C1b (0)\n\n\u22122C1a (r)C1b (r) \u2212 2C2a (r)C2b (r)\n\u22122[C3 (r)]2 + 4[C3 (0)]2 + 2[C4 (r)]2 . (9)\n\nc\nHere C1,2\n(r) are for the third (decoupled, off-critical)\nQIC. The extra terms in SIz (r) is due to the admixture of\nthe first two QICs in the presence of the magnetic field.\nActually, 4[C3 (0)]2 is the magnetization squared.

The gap of the first two coupled QICs (m\u2212\n\u2206-h model) is determined by \u2206ab\ngap = min(Ek ). In axially symmetric case (\u2206 = 0), the gap decreases linearly: \u2206ab\ngap (h) = (m \u2212 h)\u03b8(m \u2212 h). In general case,\nthe gap function is shown in Fig. 1 (solid line), which\nhas the following features: When h is small, it diminishes from m2 (the smaller mass of the two) as\nh2\n\u2206ab\ngap (h) \u2248 m2 \u2212 2\u2206 . In the vicinity of the critical point,\nhc = (m2 \u2212 \u22062 )1/2 = (m1 m2 )1/2 , the gap vanishes linearly\nhc\nat both sides as \u2206ab\ngap (h) \u2248 m |h \u2212 hc |. When the mag2\n\n\u2206\n, the gap\nnetic field is further increased to h\u2217c \u2248 hc + \u03bbm\nposition in momentum space begins to shift from k = 0 to\n\u0002\n(\u03bb2 +2)\u22062 \u0003\n\u2217 1/2\n1/2\nkc\u2217 (h) \u2248 ( 2m\n. As a result,\n+ (2m)\n3/2 \u03bb5/2 (h \u2212 hc )\n\u03bb )\na gapful incommensurate phase is expected at large h.\nOn the other hand, it is shown that when h > h\u2217c and\nfor small \u2206, the gap \u2206ab\ngap \u223c \u2206. Therefore, in the axially\nsymmetric case, the gap closes in this region.\n\n\f3\nh<\n_ hc\n\n0.2\n\n0.05\n\nh>\n_ hc\n0\n\n0\n\n~\n\nhc*\n\nm=0.1\n\u2206=0.05\n\nhc*\n\nhc\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221230\n\u221240\n\u22121\n\n\u22122\n\nhc\nhc\u22120.005\n0.07\n0.05\n0.03\n0.01\n\n\u221230\n\n0\n0.2\n\n\u22123\n0\n\n\u22121\n\n\u221210\n\nab\n\nh\n\nln|C\u03bc\u03bc(r)|\n\n0.01\n\nhc\nhc+0.005\n0.094\n0.096\n0.098\n0.1\n0.12\n\n\u221210\nab\n\n0.02\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221230\n0\n\nln|C\u03bc\u03c3(r)|\n\n0.1\n\n\u221220\n\nab\n\nln|C\u03c3\u03bc(r)|\n\n~\n\nkc*(h), kc*(h)\n\nab\n\n\u2206gap(h), meff(h)\n\n0.03\n\n0\n\n\u221210\n\n\u221210\n\n0.04\n\nThe identification of the Ising criticality at hc follows from the linearly vanishing behavior of the gap and\nthe diagonalized Hamiltonian. Since Ek+ always remains\nmassive, the modes that associated drop effectively out\nof the low-energy theory, which is resultingly an Ising\ntheory keeping only half of the original degrees of freedom.

The parameters are same as in Fig. 1.\n\nparameter ranges for the m-\u2206-h model (1) or (3). The\ncritical Ising sheets, determined by the condition h =\nhc (m1 , m2 ), arise from the trivial Ising lines (m1 = 0 and\nm2 = 0 at h = 0), and merge the C-IC sheets, pinned\ndown by h = h\u2217c (m1 , m2 ), at the U(1) symmetric line\nh = m1 = m2 , i.e., the usual C-IC transition line in the\naxially symmetric case (\u2206 = 0). Above the transition\nonly the system with the U(1) symmetry is critical.\n\u2217\nUnfortunately, although \u2206ab\ngap and kc are enlightening\nand analytically expressible, neither of them is the true\nquantity that controls the asymptotic behaviors of the\ncorrelation functions. We have to numerically extract the\ncorresponding effective mass meff (i.e., inverse of the correlation length) and effective incommensurate wavevector k\u0303c\u2217 from the fermion correlation functions, Eqs. (5),\nby evaluating the integrals. For comparison, we show\nthese two quantities in the same Fig. 1 (the solid and\nopen circles). As a result, the real C-IC transition point\nh\u0303\u2217c locates between hc and h\u2217c . We also see from the figure\nthat the effective mass, which is in general greater than\nthe gap of the system, deviates significantly from the gap\nabove the Ising transition. The mass grows rapidly until the system enters the incommensurate phase where\nthe mass becomes field independent. In the vicinity of\nthe Ising transition, the linearized effective mass (dotted\nwedge) asymptotically coincides with the numerical mass\nvalues (solid circles). The dissociation between the gap\nand mass is in fact due to the external field which breaks\nthe Lorentz invariance of the model.\nBy combining Eqs. (8), (7), and (6), and the known\nvalues of functions C1a (r)\u2013C4 (r), we compute the four\ncorrelation functions of the Ising pairs numerically.

We find that below the Ising\nab\ntransition C\u03bc\u03bc\n(r), as in the h = 0 case, is asymptotab\nically a constant, while above the transition C\u03bc\u03c3\n(r) becomes a constant. The lines decrease faster (in fact twice)\nab\nab\nin C\u03c3\u03c3\n(r) before the Ising transition and in C\u03c3\u03bc\n(r) after\nthe transition. Furthermore, even in the incommensurate\nab\nab\nphase, functions C\u03c3\u03bc\n(r) and C\u03bc\u03c3\n(r) are not modulated by\n\u2217\nthe wavevector k\u0303c . We also recognize that with respect\nto the effective Ising theory, the combined operators \u03bc1 \u03c32\nand \u03bc1 \u03bc2 take effectively the roles of the Ising order and\ndisorder fields across the transition, since their correlations have the standard power and exponential forms.\nFinally, by Eqs. (9) and (10), we obtain the results\nof spin correlations in various phases. In the axially\nsymmetric case (\u2206 = 0), when the field exceeds the\nC-IC transition point, we find the transverse uniform\nspin correlations: SIx,y (r) \u221d r\u22123/2 e\u2212m3 r sin[kc r \u2212 \u03b4(kc )]\nwith the phase shift \u03b4(kc ) \u223c kmc and the incommensurate\n1/2\nwavevector kc \u2248 ( 2m\n(h \u2212 m)1/2 , and the longitudi\u03bb )\nnal uniform spin correlations: \u2206SIz (r) = SIz (r) \u2212 M 2 \u221d\n\u2212r\u22122 [1 \u2212 cos(2kc r)] with M = k\u03c0c the magnetization; and\nx,y\nthe transverse staggered correlations: SN\n(r) \u221d r\u22121/2 ,\nz\nand the longitudinal staggered correlations: SN\n(r) \u221d\n\u22121 \u2212m3 r\nr e\ncos(kc r). These results are in agreement with\nthose from other theories [6] just above the transition\npoint. In anisotropic case, the asymptotics for the spin\ncorrelations are summarized in Table I. Here, the phase\nshifts in the incommensurate phase, restricted within\n(0, \u03c0), are in general field and mass dependent; \u03b7(< 1)\nis also a non-universal constant. As argued by Affleck\n[2], we verify that one of the transverse staggered spin\ny\ncorrelations (SN\nin our case) behaves simply like the correlation of an Ising variable across the transition, and the\nfluctuation of the longitudinal uniform correlation obeys\nthe power-law \u2206SIz \u221d r\u22122 at the criticality.\nTo summarize, we have studied the Haldane spin-1 system with generic anisotropies under the effect of external\nmagnetic field. We showed explicitly the Ising criticality in both the spectrum and correlation functions. The\nlatter was calculated based on the establishment of the\nblock-Toeplitz determinant representation for the correlations of the Ising pair-fields. A true long-range order is\nformed above the transition. We also found the incommensurability in high field is a rather robust property,\n\ny\nSN\n(r)\n\u22121/2 \u2212m2 r\n\nr\ne\nr \u22121/2 e\u2212meff r\nr \u22121/4\n1\n1\n\nz\nSN\n(r)\n\u22121/2 \u2212m3 r\nr\ne\nr \u22121/2 e\u2212m3 r\nr \u22123/4 em3 r\nr \u22121 e\u2212(meff +m3 )r\n\u2212r \u22121 e\u2212(meff +m3 )r\n\u00d7 cos(k\u0303c\u2217 r+\u03b4\u03bc\u03bc )\n\nwhich appears in both iso- and anisotropic systems, and\nthe mass (not the gap) is field independent in the incommensurate phase. Finally, we emphasize the fact that the\nC-IC transition (point h\u0303\u2217c ) in the massive phase is thermodynamically unidentifiable, in other words, there is no\nanomaly associated with this transition in either magnetization or specific heat measurement. The discussions\nin this respect, as well as the detailed formalism of the\npresent work, will be published elsewhere.\nI am very grateful to F. Essler and A.
