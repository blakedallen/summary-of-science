(Ultra) Luminous Infrared Galaxies [(U)LIRGs] are important galaxy populations for studying galaxy evolution,\nand responsible for a significant fraction of the past star formation beyond z \u223c 1. Local (U)LIRGs can be used to study\ncriteria adequate to characterize similar high-z populations. Of particular interest is to identify reliable kinematic-based\nmethods capable of distinguishing disks and mergers, as their relative fraction is a key observational input to constrain\ndifferent evolutionary scenarios.\nMethods. Our goal is to analyze in detail the kinematics of the ionized gas of a small sample of LIRGs and study criteria\nable to characterize the status of these systems.\nResults. We have obtained VIMOS/VLT optical integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data for a sample of 4 LIRGs which\nhave been selected at a similar distance (\u223c 70 Mpc) to avoid relative resolution effects. They have been classified in two\ngroups (isolated disk and post-coalescence mergers) according to their morphology.

We present and discuss new kinematic maps (i.e., velocity field and velocity dispersion) for these four\ngalaxies. When the full 2-D kinematic information of the IFS data is analyzed with kinemetry, their morphological and\nkinematic classifications are consistent, with disks having lower kinematic asymmetries than post-coalescence mergers.\nWe propose and discuss a new kinematic criterion to differentiate these two groups. In particular, we introduce a weighting which favors the outer parts of the kinematic maps when computing the total asymmetries. This is motivated by\nthe fact that post-coalescence mergers show relatively small kinematic asymmetries in the inner parts as a consequence\nof the rapid relaxation into a rotating disk, with the outer parts being still out of equilibrium (i.e., larger asymmetries).\nThis new criterion distinguishes better these two categories and has the advantage of being less sensitive to angular\nresolution effects. According to the previous kinemetry-based work aimed at distinguishing disks and mergers at high-z,\nthe present post-coalescence systems would have been classified as disks. This indicates that the separation of disks\nfrom mergers is subjective to the definition of 'merger'. It also suggests that previous estimates of the merger/disk ratio\ncould have been underestimated, but larger samples are necessary to establish a firmer conclusion.\nKey words. galaxies \u2013 kinematics \u2013 luminous infrared galaxies \u2013 integral field spectroscopy\n\n1. Introduction\nThe kinematic characterization of high-z galaxy populations is a key observational element to distinguish between\ndifferent galaxy evolutionary scenarios, since it may help\nto find out the fraction of rotating disks and mergers at\ndifferent cosmic epochs. This is a key observational input\nto constrain the relative role of major mergers vs. steady\ncool gas accretion in shaping galaxies, which still is under discussion (e.g. Genzel et al. 2001; Tacconi et al.\n2008;\nDekel et al.\n2009;\nF\u00f6rster Schreiber et al.\n2009;\nLemoine-Busserolle & Lamareille\n2010;\nLemoine-Busserolle et al. 2010; Bournaud et al. 2011;\nEpinat 2011).\nWith the aid of integral field spectroscopy (IFS) we can\nresolve the kinematic status and internal processes at work\nwithin galaxies and better understand the role of the dominant mechanisms involved at early epochs. For instance,\nF\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. (2009) classified the SINS sample\n(i.e., 63 galaxies with 1.3 < z < 2.6) concluding that these\nobjects can be classified as: 'rotation-dominated', interacting or merging systems and 'dispersion-dominated' (i.e.,\n\ndominated by large amounts of random motions). They\nfound these types in a similar fraction (i.e., 1/3 each). They\nfound a small fraction of galaxies showing signs of major\nmerger events (i.e., F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2006; Law et al.\n2009; Genzel et al. 2006, 2008) therefore suggesting that\nthe majority of the star forming galaxies at these redshifts\nis fed by gas via continuous cold flows along streams (including minor mergers).\nAt intermediate redshift (z \u223c 0.6), spatially resolved\nkinematics has revealed a large fraction of chaotic velocity fields, supporting that most local spirals were rebuilt\nafter a major merger since z = 1 (Hammer et al. 2005;\nPuech 2010). At similar redshifts, Flores et al. (2006) and\nYang et al. (2008) investigated the velocity fields of galaxies with IFS, and derived that only 35% of their sources can\nbe classified as rotating disks while the rest show perturbed\nor complex kinematics.\nSome local galaxy populations are particularly relevant for the study of galaxy evolution. This is the case\nof nearby Luminous and Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies\n(LIRGs, LIR = [8-1000 \u03bcm] =1011 - 1012 L\u2299 , and ULIRGs,\n1\n\n\fBellocchi et al.: Kinematic asymmetries of disks and post-coalescence mergers\n\nLIR > 1012 L\u2299 , respectively). Despite these objects are\nrelatively rare in the local universe, they are much more\nnumerous at high-z and are responsible of a significant fraction of the whole past star formation beyond z \u223c 1 (e.g.,\nLe Floc'h et al. 2005; P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2005, 2008).\nThese objects exhibit a large range of interacting/merging\nproperties, from mostly isolated discs for low luminosity\nLIRGs (e.g. log LIR \u2264 11.3, Arribas et al. 2004) to a majority of merger remnants for ULIRGs (e.g. log LIR \u2265 12,\nVeilleux et al. 2002). Local (U)LIRGs were initially considered as the local counterpart of high-z (U)LIRGs like those\ndiscovered by Spitzer and the more luminous submillimiter\ngalaxies (SMGs; e.g. Blain et al. 2002; Tacconi et al. 2006).\nThe study of local (U)LIRGs is also important to better\nunderstand the star formation history in the universe and\nit can provide an opportunity to correlate the properties\nof local and high-z populations. Moreover, large scale turbulences, tidal tails and outflows can be studied in detail\nallowing a good characterization of these objects. However,\nthere are some discussion about the similarities between local and distant (U)LIRGs (e.g., Rujopakarn et al. 2011 and\nreferences therein).\nRecently several authors have analyzed the velocity\nfields and velocity dispersion maps of different galaxy\nsamples with the aim of discerning merging and nonmerging systems based on their kinematic properties using the kinemetry methodology (Krajnovi\u0107 et al. 2006).\nJesseit et al. (2007) and Kronberger et al. (2007) have investigated the distortions in the velocity fields of simulated\ninteracting disc/merger galaxies at different redshifts in\nthe range z = 0 \u2212 1, while Shapiro et al. (2008) (hereafter, S08) provide a straightforward mean of classifying\nz \u223c 2 galaxies, observed with SINFONI/VLT, as disks or\nmergers based on the asymmetries of their velocity field\nand velocity dispersion maps. They compare and distinguish two kinematic classes characterized by recent major\nmerger events (i.e., mergers) and those without signs of interacting or recent merger activity (i.e., disks).\nSimilar works based on IFS data (i.e., OSIRIS/Keck,\nBasu-Zych et al. 2009; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2010) are focused on nearby objects (i.e., supercompact UV-Luminous\nGalaxies (ScUVLGs) and Lyman Break Analogs (LBAs)).\nThe morphology and kinematics of LBAs projected at high\nredshift show similarities with compact and dispersiondominated z \u223c 2 galaxies (Basu-Zych et al. 2009). This\nsuggests that galaxy interaction and/or mergers could also\nbe driving the dynamics of dispersion-dominated z \u223c 2\ngalaxies.\nIn this paper we present new spatially resolved kinematics of four local LIRGs obtained with the VLT/VIMOS\nIFU as part of a larger project to characterize the properties\nof (U)LIRGs on the basis of optical and infrared Integral\nField Spectroscopy (Colina et al. 2005; Arribas et al. 2008;\nMonreal-Ibero et al. 2010; Rodr\u0131\u0301guez-Zaur\u0131\u0301n et al. 2011\nand references therein). The fact that two of our LIRGs\nare post-coalescence mergers will offer the opportunity to\nexplore the potential of the kinemetry method when analyzing the velocity fields and velocity dispersion maps in\nmoderately disturbed and partially relaxed systems. The\npaper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we present the\nsample selection as well as some details about the observations, data reductions, line fitting and velocity map construction. Section 3 is devoted to the description of the main\nkinematic properties of the individual objects. In Section\n2\n\n4, the kinemetry analysis and its potential to distinguish\ndiscs and mergers are presented and discussed with the\naid of different asymmetry planes. Finally, the main results\nand conclusions are summarized in Section 5.\nThroughout the paper we will consider H0 = 70\nkm/s/Mpc, \u03a9M = 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.7.\n\n2. The VIMOS sample, observations, data\nreduction, line fitting and map construction\n2.1. The sample and morphological classification\nFor the present analysis we have selected 4 LIRG galaxies at a similar distance (\u223c 70 Mpc): two of them (i.e.,\nIRAS F11255-4120, IRAS F10567-4310) are morphologically classified as class 0 objects and two (i.e., IRAS\nF04315-0840, IRAS F21453-3511) as class 2 objects according to Arribas et al. (2008) and Rodr\u0131\u0301guez Zaur\u0131\u0301n et al.\n(2010) (hereafter, Paper I and Paper III respectively). In\nthis classification scheme class 0 is defined as an object\nwith relatively symmetric morphology, appearing to be isolated with no evidence for strong past or ongoing interaction (hereafter, disks), while class 2 is an object with a\nmorphology suggesting a post-coalescence merging phase,\nwith a single nucleus or two distinct nuclei at a projected\ndistance D < 1.5 kpc (hereafter, post-coalescence mergers).\nWe have chosen these four systems at the same distance as\nthey will allow us to discuss their relative kinematic properties avoiding linear resolution dependency effects. In table 1\nwe present the main properties of the sample: note that the\nsystems classified as post-coalescence mergers have higher\nLIR than the disks.\n2.2. Observations\nThe observations were carried out in service mode using\nthe Integral Field Unit of VIMOS (Le F\u00e8vre et al. 2003),\nat the Very Large Telescope (VLT), covering the spectral\nrange (5250 \u2212 7400) \u00c5 with the high resolution mode 'HRorange' (grating GG435) and a mean spectral resolution of\n3470. The field of view (FoV) in this configuration is 27\u2032\u2032\n\u00d7 27\u2032\u2032 , with a spaxel scale of 0.67\u2032\u2032 per fiber (i.e., 1600\nspectra are obtained simultaneously from 40 \u00d7 40 fibers\narray). A square 4 pointing dithering pattern is used, with\na relative offset of 2.7\u2032\u2032 (i.e., 4 spaxels). The exposure time\nper pointing ranges from 720 to 850 seconds, such that,\nthe total integration time per galaxy is between 2880 and\n3400 seconds. For further details about the observations see\nPaper I.\n2.3. Data reduction\nThe VIMOS data are reduced with a combination of the\npipeline Esorex (version 3.5.1 and 3.6.5) included in the\npipeline provided by ESO, and different customized IDL\nand IRAF scripts. The basic data reduction is performed\nusing the Esorex pipeline (bias subtraction, flat field correction, spectra tracing and extraction, correction of fiber\nand pixel transmission and relative flux calibration). Then\nfour quadrants per pointing are reduced individually and\ncombined in a single data cube associated for each pointing. After that, the four independent dithered pointings are\ncombined together to end up with the final 'super-cube',\n\n\fBellocchi et al.: Kinematic asymmetries of disks and post-coalescence mergers\n\nTable 1.

Typical values of the central wavelength and width distribution of the [OI]\u03bb6300.3 \u00c5 sky line registered in the data\ncubes along with their standard deviations (errors).\n\nof the fit. For each emission line we end up with the following information: p\ncentral wavelength (\u03bbc ), intrinsic width\n2 \u2212 \u03c32\n(\u03c3line ) (i.e., \u03c3line = \u03c3obs\nIN S ) and flux intensity along\nwith their respective errors. To obtain the radial velocity\nuncertainty estimates, wavelength calibration and fitting\nerrors were combined inp\nquadrature, giving a global wavelength error of \u2206\u03bbtot = \u2206\u03bb2MP F IT + \u2206\u03bb2c . For high S/N\nspectra the wavelength calibration error can be considered\nthe main source of uncertainty since the fitting errors are\ntypically substantially smaller (and vice versa for low S/N\nspectra). For the fitting errors, we derive values generally\nsmaller than 0.2 \u00c5 while the wavelength calibration errors\nare of the order of \u223c 0.12 \u00c5 as shown in Tab. 2. An average\nvalue of the \u03c3IN S of (85 \u00b1 9) km/s is derived at the corresponding wavelength, along with a mean FWHM of (1.82\n\u00b1 0.19) \u00c5 .\nWe start fitting all the lines to single Gaussian profiles\nsince the main component usually extends over the entire\ngalaxy. Two-Gaussian profiles (i.e., main and broad components) are needed for the inner regions of the four objects.\nUsing a collection of procedures written in IDL code (i.e,\njmaplot, Ma\u0131\u0301z-Apell\u00e1niz 2004), we generate flux intensity,\nvelocity field and velocity dispersion maps, respectively, for\nthe main and broad components (Figures 1 - 4) along with\na VIMOS continuum image. When HST images are available (i.e, NICMOS F160W (H-band) and ACS F814W (I\nband)) they are also shown in the panels.\n\n3. Kinematic properties of individual objects\n2.4. Line fitting and map construction\nAs mentioned in the previous paragraph, we are interested\nin the H\u03b1 - [NII] emission line complex analysis. The observed emission profiles of the individual spectra are fitted to a Gaussian function using an IDL routine (i.e.,\nMPFITEXPR, implemented by C. B. Markwardt). This algorithm finds the best set of model parameters which match\nthe data and it is able to fix the line intensity ratios and\nthe wavelength differences according to the atomic parameters when adjusting multiple emission lines (i.e., the H\u03b1 [NII] complex). The MPFIT routine provides errors for the\noutput parameters and gives an estimate of the goodness\n\nIn this section we describe the global kinematic behavior as\ninferred from our IFS maps (i.e, flux intensity, velocity field\nand velocity dispersion). We will also infer some kinematic\nparameters (e.g., \u03c3c , vc /\u03c3c , vshear /\u03a3 and dynamical mass\nMdyn ) useful to characterize these systems.\nThe ratio of the maximum circular rotation velocity vc\n(i.e., the half of the observed peak-to-peak velocity) and\nthe central velocity dispersion \u03c3c measures the nature of\nthe gravitational support of a system in equilibrium. A\nvc /\u03c3c \u2265 1 is the signature of a rotation-dominated system while a lower value (i.e., vc /\u03c3c < 1) means that the\nobject is dispersion-dominated, as in the case of elliptical\ngalaxies, where the galaxy is sustained against gravitational\n3\n\n\fBellocchi et al.: Kinematic asymmetries of disks and post-coalescence mergers\n\ncollapse by the pressure originated by random motions of\nthe stars. When analyzing the vc /\u03c3c parameter it is important to realize that the presence of flows, superwinds or\nother merger-induced processes are factors that may lead to\nlarge vc and/or \u03c3c values. Therefore we compute the circular velocity vc and the central velocity dispersion \u03c3c using\nthe component of one-Gaussian model fit (i.e., 1c) and the\nmain (i.e., the one defining the systemic behaviour) component of the two-Gaussian model fit (i.e., 2c).\nSince class 0 objects show the features of an ideal rotating disk 1 we correct their kinematic values for their respective inclination; class 2 objects show the velocity fields\ndistorted such that we derive their kinematic values with\nand without correcting for the inclination.\nThe ratio between the velocity shear vshear and the\nglobal velocity dispersion in the whole galaxy \u03a3 has been\nderived too, as done in Gon\u00e7alves et al. (2010). The vshear\n(not corrected for the inclination of the object) has been\ncomputed as the median of the 5-percentile at each end of\nthe velocity distribution, for the vmax and vmin and then\ndefined as vshear = 21 (vmax \u2212 vmin ).\nWe have also used the kinematic information to derive\nthe dynamical mass Mdyn . This mass takes into account the\nwhole gravitational field and so dark matter, gas and stellar components are included. Spiral galaxies can be modeled\nusing a flat component for the disk and a spheroidal component for the central concentration (i.e., a de Vaucouleurs\nprofile and a massive halo). Assuming that the central regions are virialized, the observed velocity dispersion of the\nionized gas \u03c3c can provide a good estimate for the disk's\ndynamical mass (Mdyn , e.g., Colina et al. 2005). We use the\nfollowing relation:\nMdyn = m 106 Rhm \u03c3c2 M\u2299\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Rhm is the half-mass radius in kpc and \u03c3c is the\ncentral velocity dispersion in km/s. The Rhm parameter is\nnot an observable itself and therefore it cannot be measured\ndirectly, so it can be inferred from measuring the radius\nthat encloses half luminosity (i.e., Ref f ). The Ref f were\nobtained from existing 2MASS near-infrared imaging. The\nextinction in the near-IR is a factor of 5-10 smaller than\nthat in the optical and a proper way to minimize these effects is to measure the half-light radius in the H or K bands\nas done here. The parameter m depends on the mass distribution: its value ranges from 1.4, for a King stellar mass\ndistribution with a tidal-to-core ratio of 50, which is a good\nrepresentation of elliptical galaxies (Tacconi et al. 2002), to\n1.75 for a polytropic sphere with a density index covering a\nrange of values (Spitzer 1987), to 2.1 for a de Vaucouleurs\nmass distribution (Combes et al. 1995). As in Colina et al.\n(2005) we will assume m = 1.75. All these results are shown\nin the table 3; their inclinations are drawn from the NED\nsite and are consistent with our own estimates from the H\u03b1\ndistribution.\n1\nWe refer to ideal rotating disk as a thin disk with gas clouds\nkinematically characterized by: a velocity field that peaks at the\ngalaxy major axis and goes to zero along the minor axis of each\norbit, while the velocity dispersion will be constant long each\norbit and will decrease between orbits of increasing major axes\n(see description in Sec. 4.1)\n\n4\n\n3.1. IRAS F11255-4120 (ESO 319-G022)\nThis is a class 0 object, appearing to be a single isolated\ngalaxy with a relatively symmetric morphology according\nto its DSS image. It is a barred spiral with a ring extended\nup to \u223c 4 kpc from the nuclear region, clearly detected in\nour H\u03b1 image. The orientation of the bar is different in\nthe VIMOS continuum image (P.A. \u223c 110\u25e6 ) and in the H\u03b1\nimage (P.A. \u223c 150\u25e6 ).\nFor the main component, as shown in the top panel\nof Fig. 1, the velocity dispersion (\u03c3) map has a (almost)\ncentrally peaked structure with values of 120 km/s (high\nvalues also in the bar structure) and a lower mean value (\u223c\n20 km/s) is found in the ring. The location of this peak does\nnot agree with those of the H\u03b1 flux intensity and continuum\nmaps with an offset of about 0.6 kpc (i.e., \u223c 2 arcsec). The\nkinematic center of the velocity field well agrees with the\nH\u03b1 flux peak. The projection of the rotation axis (minor\nkinematic axis) seems to be shifted by about 30\u25e6 with respect to the orientation of the bar in the H\u03b1 flux intensity\nmap and in agreement with the bar of the continuum. The\nobserved velocity amplitude for the main component at a\ndistance of 4 kpc from the H\u03b1 peak is of the order of (300\n\u00b1 8) km/s.\nA small region of about \u223c 0.67 kpc x 0.89 kpc in the\nnuclear region shows traces of a second component, indicating the presence of a non-rotational mechanisms (e.g.,\noutflow / wind). This component is blueshifted by 80 km/s\nwith respect to the main one and shows a broad velocity\ndispersion \u03c3 in the range (160 - 220) km/s and a velocity\namplitude of the order of (60 \u00b1 7) km/s.\nThe vc /\u03c3c and vshear /\u03a3 have values of 2.3 and 2.7 respectively, supporting the idea that this galaxy is rotationdominated: the kinematic properties of this galaxy seem to\nbe consistent with its morphology (i.e., a rotating disk).\n3.2. IRAS F10567-4310 (ESO 264-G057)\nFrom the DSS image IRAS F10567-4310 is morphologically\nclassified as class 0 object (see Paper III). The H\u03b1 flux map\ninferred from our IFU data (top panel of Fig. 2) shows a ring\nwith a patchy distribution and its peak is in good positional\nagreement with the center of the of galaxy as inferred from\nthe continuum.\nThe main component shows a centrally peaked velocity\ndispersion map with typical values of 60 - 70 km/s. Its general morphology resembles that of the H\u03b1 flux map (i.e.,\nregions with high H\u03b1 surface brightness tend to have large\nvelocity dispersion, with a mean value of 40 km/s). This\ncomponent shows a disk-like regular velocity field with a\nclear rotation pattern, with the kinematic center in a good\npositional agreement with the H\u03b1 flux peak. The observed\nvelocity amplitude is of (300 \u00b1 6) km/s computed at a distance of 4.7 kpc from the kinematic center.\nA secondary kinematic distinct component is identified\nin the nuclear region over an extension of \u223c 1.2 kpc x 0.9\nkpc; it shows a velocity amplitude of (128 \u00b1 9) km/s and it\nis blue-shifted by \u223c 70 km/s with respect to the main one;\nits velocity dispersion is in the range (90 - 180) km/s.\nThe vc /\u03c3c parameter clearly classifies this object as\nrotation-dominated with vc /\u03c3c \u223c 4.6 and vshear /\u03a3 \u223c 3.\nKinematics of this class 0 object is also consistent with its\nmorphology.\n\n\fBellocchi et al.: Kinematic asymmetries of disks and post-coalescence mergers\nSource F11255\u22124120\n\nSource F10567\u22124310\n\nVIMOS CONTINUUM FLUX\n\nVIMOS CONTINUUM FLUX\n\n0.06\n\n\u22120.45\n\n\u22121.38\narcsec\n\n\u22120.97\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u22122.52\n\u22123.66\n\n\u22121.48\n\u221210\n\n\u221210\n\u22122.00\n\n\u22124.79\n\u221210\n\n\u03c3 MAIN COMP\n\nFLUX MAIN COMP\n1.59\n10\n\n68\n\n0\n\n\u221210\n\n\u221210\n\n0\n\n\u221210\n\n0\n\n\u221210\n\n\u03c3 BROAD COMP\n\nFLUX BROAD COMP\n1.49\n\nv BROAD COMP\n\n0.44\n\n\u22125\n\n0\n\n191\n\n174\n\n\u22125\n\n0.09\n\u22125\n\n0\narcsec\n\n5\n\n4847\n\n4832\n\n\u22125\n\n158\n\u22125\n\n0\n\n5\n\narcsec\n\n0\n\n5\n\narcsec\n\n0\n\n0.25\n\n0\narcsec\n\n5\n\n0\n\n10\n\nv BRAOD COMP\n182\n\n5\n\n5159\n\n5\n\n160\n0\n\n137\n115\n\n\u22125\n\n0.02\n\u22125\n\n\u221210\n\n\u03c3 BROAD COMP\n\n0.47\n\n\u22125\n\n5012\n\n10\n\n0.69\n0\n\n4817\n\u22125\n\n\u221210\n\n0.91\n\n4862\n0\n\n5086\n\u221210\n\n1\n\n10\n\n5\n\n5\n207\n\narcsec\n\n0.79\n\n0\n\nFLUX BROAD COMP\n4877\n\n5\n1.14\n\n\u221210\n\u221210\n\n5161\n\n0\n\n19\n\n\u22121.20\n\n10\n\n224\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5235\n\n37\n\n0\n\n\u22120.54\n\n4774\n\n10\n\n10\n55\n\n0.11\n\n0\n\n\u221210\n\n0\n\n10\n\n5310\n\n10\n0.77\n\n4849\n\u221210\n\n\u22121.19\n\u221210\n\n4923\n\n0\n\n34\n\nv MAIN COMP\n73\n\n10\n4998\n\narcsec\n\narcsec\n\n0.20\n\n0\n\n\u03c3 MAIN COMP\n1.43\n\n10\n101\n\n\u22120.50\n\narcsec\n\n5073\n\n10\n\n0.89\n\n10\n\nFLUX MAIN COMP\n\nv MAIN COMP\n135\n\n0\n\n5127\narcsec\n\n10\n\narcsec\n\n0\n\narcsec\n\n\u221210\n\narcsec\n\narcsec\n\n\u22120.24\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n5095\n5063\n\n\u22125\n\n93\n\u22125\n\n0\narcsec\n\n5\n\n5031\n\u22125\n\n0\n\n5\n\narcsec\n\nFig. 1.

The green and blue curves represent\nrespectively the main and broad components.\n\n2.4 kpc from the nucleus (i.e., H\u03b1 flux peak) in the northern\narm. The velocity field of the main component is somewhat\ndistorted and chaotic with an amplitude of (325 \u00b1 5) km/s.\nThe projection of the rotation axis in the outer part (con6\n\nnecting the N-E to S-W part) is not aligned with that of\nthe inner part (aligned as N-S direction).\nA broad component is found in the inner region and\ncovers a relatively large area of \u223c 2.4 kpc x 2.7 kpc. This\ncomponent is blue-shifted by 50 km/s with respect to the\nmain component. Its velocity dispersion is in the range (70\n- 400) km/s with a velocity amplitude of (760 \u00b1 13) km/s.\nThe fact that the projection of the kinematic axis of this\nbroad component has a shift of almost 90\u25e6 with respect to\nthe main component and the blue-shifted region of the velocity field shows the largest velocity dispersion (i.e., \u223c 400\nkm/s) supports the hypothesis of a dusty outflow, where\nthe receding components (which are behind the disk) are\nobscured, making the whole profile relatively narrow with\nrespect to the approaching component.\nWe derive a vc /\u03c3c > 1 even when the inclination correction is not included (i.e., vc /\u03c3c \u2248 1.4 - 2.3): it shows the\ndominance of an intrinsic rotation over random motions.\nTherefore, this parameter would classify this object as rotation dominated.\n\nIRAS F21453-3511 is a peculiar class 2 object, with traces\nof spiral and asymmetric morphology from the HST and\nDSS images. The ionized gas, as traced by the H\u03b1 emission, is concentrated in the nuclear region and mostly in\nthe northern spiral arm.\nThe asymmetric velocity dispersion map of the main\ncomponent shows higher values in the northern arm and its\ncentral part (i.e., two local maxima can be revealed) with\nvalues of 80 km/s. The velocity field of the same component\nshows an asymmetric behavior where three main regions\ncan be identified: the SW part having a mean value of 4900\nkm/s, the NW one with 4850 km/s and the E part with\n4780 km/s. The NW part could have different inclination\nthan the rest of the observed regions, so explaining this\npeculiar velocity structure. The kinematic center can be\nwell identified with the H\u03b1 flux peak although the rotational\naxis it is not well defined. The photometric major axis in the\nNICMOS image seems to be orientated in the N-S direction\nand the ACS image seems to reveal a ring of knots with a\nmajor axis orientated along P.A. \u223c 135\u25e6 .\nA small region of about 1.5 kpc x 1.3 kpc in the nuclear\npart shows a second component. The blue-shifted region\nof its velocity field shows the largest velocity dispersion\n(i.e., \u03c3 \u223c 400 km/s, see Fig. 4). This feature suggests that\nan outflow is present in the inner part of the galaxy. The\namplitude of the velocity dispersion map is about (285\u00b120)\nkm/s while the velocity field amplitude is of (270\u00b116) km/s.\nThis component is blue-shifted by 150 km/s with respect\nto the main component.\nThe derived vc /\u03c3c and vshear /\u03a3 parameters are respectively 3 and 2: in this object the random motions do not\nseem to dominate although in its velocity field and velocity dispersion maps there are some anomalies. With such a\nparameter we would classify this source as rotation dominated.\n3.5.

The green and blue curves\nrepresent respectively the main and broad components.\n\n0 objects are characterized by point-antisymmetric velocity\nfields, showing the spider diagram typical of a ideal rotating disk; their velocity dispersion maps are centrally peaked\nwith a radial decay at larger radii. On the other hand,\nclass 2 objects show velocity fields which do not follow\n\nthis pattern. Despite they are to first approximation pointantisymmetric, they also show clear disturbances and asymmetries. These could be explained by a bent disk and/or\nother tidal motions, consequence of the past merger. Their\n\u03c3 maps are more asymmetric with off-nuclear regions of peculiar high velocity dispersion values (e.g., IRAS F043150840), and showing asymmetrical structures in the nuclear\nregions (e.g., IRAS F21453-3511).\nAll of our sources show signs of a broad and blue-shifted\ncomponents (i.e., with velocity shift of \u2206v = (50 - 150)\nkm/s with respect to the main component) in the inner\npart (nucleus) of the galaxy. They show mean velocity dispersions ranging between (140 - 260) km/s, which are 2 4 times higher than those of the main components. These\ncomponents cover a small area in disk objects (i.e., \u223c 1\nkpc2 ) while larger areas (i.e., 2 - 6 kpc2 ) are involved for\nthe post-coalescence mergers, showing more complex and\ndistorted spectra. Although this component is more prominent for the class 2 objects, the fact that it is blueshifted\nfor the four sources and have high associated velocities\nsuggests that an outflow can exist in their inner regions.\nFurthermore, the velocity field patterns of this component\n(i.e., kinematic axes perpendicular to those of the main\ncomponent) support the dusty outflow hypothesis.\nFrom our kinematic results we see that the sole use of\n1D parameters vc /\u03c3c and / or vshear /\u03a3 does not seem to\ngive us a unique classification for our sources. Indeed, according to them, our objects seem to be rotation dominated,\neven when the inclination correction is not included. Their\nvc /\u03c3c values are between those typical of local spiral galaxies (i.e., vc /\u03c3c \u223c 5 - 15, Epinat et al. 2010) and those obtained for Lyman Break Analogs at z \u223c 0.2 (with vc /\u03c3c \u223c\n0.4 - 1.8, Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2010). The derived global velocity\ndispersions \u03a3 generally are between (40 - 60) km/s, quite\ncomparable to those obtained in Gon\u00e7alves et al. (2010) for\nLBAs, with a typical median value of \u223c 67 km/s, but much\nhigher than those observed in other lower luminosity local star-forming galaxies (i.e., typical \u03c3 \u223c 5 - 15 km/s,\ne.g., Dib et al. 2006). For a comparison we also derived the\nvshear (not corrected for the inclination of the galaxy) as\nexplained before. Our values ranges between 50 (i.e., IRAS\nF04315-0840) and 130 km/s. This parameter reveals higher\ndegree of rotation if compared with the values obtained for\nLBAs (i.e., vshear < 70 km/s) where in many cases a significant velocity gradient has not been observed, and no\nactual rotation can be identified. Then, we derive vshear /\u03a3\nshowing values typical of rotation dominated objects (i.e.,\n\u223c 2\u22123, Epinat et al. 2010) with the exception of the galaxy\nIRAS F04315-0840 (see Tab. 3).\nThe derived dynamical masses classify our LIRGs as\nmoderate mass systems, characterized by a mean value of\n(1.8 \u00b1 0.4) * 1010 M\u2299 . Our mass estimates agree with\nthose obtained for LIRGs in Hinz & Rieke (2006) and\nV\u00e4is\u00e4nen et al. (2008), which are in the range (1010 - 1011 )\nM\u2299 .\nThe post-coalescence mergers do not show extreme kinematic asymmetries in their maps, making them good examples to test the potential of kinemetry for characterizing\nmoderate asymmetries.\n\n4. Kinemetry analysis\nThe goal of this section is to investigate the potential of the\nkinemetry method, developed by Krajnovi\u0107 et al. (2006)\n7\n\n\fBellocchi et al.: Kinematic asymmetries of disks and post-coalescence mergers\n\n(hereafter K06), when analyzing the kinematic maps of\n(U)LIRGs. In particular we want to investigate how powerful this methodology is for studying the kinematic asymmetries. First we will simply apply the kinemetry method to\nthe sample, drawing preliminary conclusions on the kinematics of these objects, then we will apply the same criteria as those proposed by Shapiro et al. (2008) and also\nexplore the potential of a new criterion to study kinematic\nasymmetries. Therefore, we expect to find out lower asymmetries for our two post-coalescence merger systems with\nrespect to those considered by S08, which are more kinematically disturbed due to recent merger activity. In our\npost-coalescence systems, the inner parts are expected to\nbe relaxed into an almost virialized disk with a large rotational component while the outer parts should still retain\nasymmetries associated to the merger events. Finally we\nanalyze the resolution / redshift effects on these results.\n\nof the ellipse (\u03bceven (\u03c8, r) \u2248 A0 (r)) and decreases when the\nsemi-major axis length increases. In this context, the A0\nterm represents the velocity dispersion profile. Higher order terms (An , Bn ) will identify deviation from symmetry\n(Krajnovi\u0107 et al. 2006).\nThere are two effects which limit the reliability with\nwhich coefficients in the expansion can be determined: (i)\nthe absolute number of points sampled along the ellipse,\nand (ii) the regularity with which these points sample the\nellipse as a function of angle, \u03b8. Ellipse parameters (i.e.,\nposition angle \u0393, centre and flattening q = b/a) can be determined by minimizing a small number of harmonic terms;\nin the code some of them can be constrained (e.g., fix the\ncenter allows the position angle \u0393 and flattening q to freely\nchange or remain fixed). The choice of a correct center is\nimportant in the analysis in order to avoid artificial overestimations of the asymmetries.\n\n4.1. The method\n\n4.2. Kinemetry of LIRGs sample\n\nThe kinemetry method, developed by Krajnovi\u0107 et al.\n(2006), comprises a decomposition of the moment maps\ninto Fourier components using ellipses. For clarity, we will\nbriefly describe again the main steps presented in K06 for a\nbetter understanding of this analysis. The Fourier analysis\nis the most straightforward approach to characterize any\nperiodic phenomenon: the periodicity of a kinematic moment can easily be seen by expressing the moment in polar\ncoordinates: K (x, y) \u2192 K (r, \u03c8). The map K(r, \u03c8) can be\nexpanded as follows to a finite number (N+1) of harmonic\nterms (frequencies):\n\nIn our analysis, the position of the galaxy's center is considered at the peak of the H\u03b1 flux intensity map. In the two\nclass 0 objects, the H\u03b1 peak is in good positional agreement\nwith the center of symmetry of the velocity field (i.e. kinematic center). For the class 2 objects, the kinematic center\nof the velocity field is not so well defined, but still the H\u03b1\npeak is in a reasonable symmetric position as well. The position angle \u0393 is left free to vary. The flattening q has also\nbeen left to vary, but within a physically meaningful range\n(i.e. 0.2-1). This allows us to consider general cases, such as\ntilted/wrapped disks. In Sec. 4.3.1. (i.e., Fig. 10) we discuss\nfurther the effects of the different choices regarding these\ninput parameters.\nOn figures 5 - 8 we present for the four galaxies the\noriginal kinematic maps (i.e., velocity field and velocity\ndispersion) along with their reconstructed maps (i.e., obtained using all the coefficients of the harmonic expansion\nup to the fifth order corrections). The residual maps (i.e.,\noriginal - model) are also shown with a typical RMS of 10\nkm/s. Therefore, in all four cases, the fits are good and the\nreconstructed maps recover the properties of the original\ndata with great detail. W e also present the behavior of the\nkinematic parameters defined in the previous section (i.e.,\nposition angle, \u0393, and the flattening, q) along with some\nof the kinemetry coefficients (k1 and k5 normalized to the\nk1 ).\nAs for the ellipse parameters, in general we find a good\noptimization for \u0393 at the different radii for the four objects.\nAs for q, there are several cases which reach the boundary\nof the range of acceptable values. In general this happens\nin the innermost regions where the rotation component,\nand therefore the amplitude of the sinusoidal velocity profile along the ellipse, are small. Therefore, the irregularities\nin the velocity field are relatively more important when\ncompared with the (rotational) amplitude of the velocity\nprofile. Since the problem of finding the best ellipse (i.e.,\nbest q and \u0393 combination) can be quite degenerate with\nmany local minima, a low q (high ellipticity) facilitates the\nminimization of \u03c72 since the latter is sensitive to a change\nin \u0393. On the contrary, if q is high (circular ellipse), the fit\n(\u03c72 ) is insensitive to a change in \u0393 making more difficult\nthe \u03c72 minimization process. As a result, q tends to have\nlow values in the inner regions, reaching in some cases the\nminimum acceptable value. In addition the q parameter is\n\nK(r, \u03c8) = A0 (r)+\n\nN\nX\n\nAn (r) sin(n*\u03c8)+Bn (r) cos(n*\u03c8), (2)\n\nn=1\n\nwhere \u03c8 is the azimuthal angle in the plane of the galaxy\n(measured from the major axis) and r is the radius of a\ngeneric the ellipse. The harmonic series can be presented in\na more compact way\nK(r, \u03c8) = A0 (r) +\n\nN\nX\n\nkn (r) * cos[n(\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c6n (r))],\n\n(3)\n\nn=1\n\nwhere the amplitude and the phase coefficients (kn ,\n\u03c6n ) are easily calculated from the A\nBn coefficients:\n\u0010n , \u0011\np\nAn\n. Thus, for an\nkn = A2n + Bn2 and \u03c6n = arctan B\nn\nideal rotating disk one would expect the velocity profile to\nbe dominated by the B1 term while the velocity dispersion\nprofile dominated by the A0 term. In the case of an odd\nmoment (\u03bcodd ), the sampling ellipse parameters are determined by requiring that the profile along the ellipse is well\ndescribed by \u03bcodd (\u03c8, r) \u2248 B1 (r) * cos(\u03c8) since the velocity\nfield peaks at the galaxy major axis (\u03c8 = 0) and goes to\nzero along the minor axis (\u03c8 = \u03c0/2). So, the power in the\nB1,v term therefore represents the circular velocity in each\nring r, while power in other coefficients represent deviations\nfrom circular motion. On the other hand, the zeroth-order\nterm, A0 gives the systemic velocity of each ring. The velocity dispersion field is an even moment (\u03bceven ) of the velocity distribution, so that its kinematic analysis is identical\nto traditional surface photometry. In an ideal rotating disk\nthe velocity dispersion has to be constant along each ring\n8\n\n\fBellocchi et al.: Kinematic asymmetries of disks and post-coalescence mergers\nIRAS 11255\u22124120\nOrig Vel\n\nRec Vel\n5073\n10\n\n4923\n\n4998\n4923\n\n0\n\n4849\n\u221210\n\n\u221210\n0\n\n18\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n4849\n\n\u221220\n\u221210\n\n4774\n\u221210\n\n37\n10\narcsec\n\n4998\n\n0\n\nResiduals Vel\n5073\n\narcsec\n\n4774\n\n10\n\n\u221210\n\n0\n\n\u221239\n\n10\n\n\u221210\n\n0\n\n10\n\narcsec\n\narcsec\n\narcsec\n\nOrig Vel Disp\n\nRec Vel Disp\n\nResiduals Vel Disp\n\n140\n10\n\n140\n10\n\n70\n\narcsec\n\n105\n\n0\n\n105\n70\n\n0\n\n35\n\u221210\n\n\u221210\n0\narcsec\n\n10\n\n36\n12\n\n0\n\n35\n\n\u221210\n\u221210\n\n0\n\u221210\n\n59\n10\narcsec\n\narcsec\n\n10\n\narcsec\n\nless constrained at low radii as a consequence of the relatively fewer data points involved and the seeing smearing,\nshowing larger errors2. This does not mean, however, that\nthe harmonic expansion to describe the kinematics is not\nwell constrained. Indeed, the reconstructed velocity maps\nare in excellent agreement with the real velocity field for\nthe inner regions (i.e., low q values), even for the innermost region (see figures 5 - 8). For large r, the amplitude of\nthe velocity profile along the ellipse is larger, and more data\npoint contribute to constrain the ellipse, being less sensitive\nto local kinematic irregularities and, therefore,providing in\ngeneral a better optimization of the parameters. At large\nradii we also find good agreement between the fit and the\ndata.\nIt follows some comments on the kinemetry results for\neach galaxy of the sample.\n\n0\n\u221210\n\n0\narcsec\n\n10\n\n\u221234\n\u221210\n\n0\n\n10\n\narcsec\n\n\u2013 IRAS F11255-4120\nThe position angle \u0393 is quite stable (\u223c 200\u25e6 \u00b1 15) over\nmost the sampled radius. In the inner part (i.e. r < 5\u2032\u2032 ),\nq has values of 0.2-0.4 and it has some instabilities at\nr \u223c 7\u2032\u2032 , likely due to the inner bar structure. However\nthe expansion recovers very well the data in all this region. k1 is mainly dominated by rotation (i.e, B1 ) and\nincreases radially up to a value of 140 km/s. The k5 /k1\nterm, which measures the small scale kinematic asymmetries, has low values up to a maximum of 0.1, pointing some minor peculiarities for r < 7\u2032\u2032 , likely due to the\nbar structure.These asymmetries become smaller in the\nouter part. The error bars are not visible being smaller\nthan the black points in the plot.\n\u2013 IRAS F10567-4310\nThe position angle \u0393 is quite stable over the sampled\nradii, with values between 210 and 250 degrees. The q\nparameter reaches the value of 0.2 in the inner region\n(i.e., r < 4\u2032\u2032 ), where the reconstructed map shows a very\ngood agreement with the data. k1 is mainly dominated\nby rotation (i.e, B1 ) and increases radially up to a value\nof 140 km/s, revealing a possible minor anomaly at r \u223c\n5\u2032\u2032 . The k5 /k1 term has very low values, with a maximum of 0.05 over the sampled radii, meaning that this\nobject is close to an ideal rotating disk structure.\n\u2013 IRAS F04315-0840\nThe position angle \u0393 typically spans from 350\u25e6 up to\n380\u25e63 , except for (r \u223c 3\u2032\u2032 ) which drops to around 320\u25e6\nas a consequence of one of the two distinct redshifted\npeaks present in the velocity field map. For most of the\nradii q is close to 1(circle-ellipses). k1 increases radially\nup to a value of 120 km/s (r < 5\u2032\u2032 ) and then decreases to\nreach a value of 100 km/s at r \u223c 15\u2032\u2032 .

The q reaches 0.2 in the region inside a\nradius of r < 6\u2032\u2032 , mainly motivated by the relatively\nsmall rotation component in this region. However the\nagreement between the kinematic fit and data is very\ngood for these radii. At r =7\u2032\u2032 q reaches a maximum (\u223c\n1) to decrease constantly to a value of 0.4. k1 does not\nreveal any strong rotational component ranging between\n10 up to 40 km/s.

Lower panel: Radial profiles\nof the kinematic properties, obtained using kinemetry program.\nThe position angle \u0393 and the flattening q of the best fitting ellipses as well as the first and the fifth order Fourier terms (respectively, k1 and k5 ) are plotted as a function of the radius.\n\nmaps (Figs. 5 - 6) resemble to those of an ideal rotating\ndisk (i.e., 'spider diagram' structure for the velocity field\nand centrally peaked velocity dispersion map) while class\n2 objects present more distorted velocity fields and irregular dispersion maps (Figs. 7 - 8). Therefore, taking into\naccount that the objects in the present sample were classified as class 0 or class 2 on the basis of pure morphological\narguments, we can conclude that their morphological and\nkinematics classification in the [\u03c3a - va ] plane are consistent.\nIn order to analyze the robustness of the results in Fig.\n9, we will analyze in the following sections their dependence\non the input parameters considered as well as in the error in\nthe radial velocities and velocity dispersion measurements.\nNote that kinemetry uses the full 2D kinematic information\nof the velocity field and velocity dispersion map, allowing\nus a good characterization of the asymmetries, something\nwhich is more efficient than using 1D parameters such as\nvc /\u03c3c and vshear /\u03a3 as seen in section 3.\n\nAs pointed out by K06, a good choice of input parameters\nis important in order to avoid an artificial overestimation\nof the asymmetries. To perform a kinemetry analysis we\nrequire to set the dynamical center, as well as to specify\ndifferent levels of constrains of the input parameters. For\ninstance, the kinematic position angle \u0393 and the flattening\nq of the ellipses can be fixed or left free to vary for the fitting\nat different radii. The COVER parameter, which controls\nthe radius at which the process stops by setting the fraction\nof the ellipse that has to be covered by data4 , has to be\nassigned too.\nIn Fig. 10 we present the results in the [\u03c3a - va ] plane\nfor our galaxies for different sets of input parameters. In\neach panel one parameter at a time is changed: respectively, the COVER (top-left), the position angle \u0393 (or PA,\ntop-right), the flattening q (bottom-left) and the CENTER\n(bottom-right) of the ellipses. We can find that the results\nare stable to a reasonable choice of values. Indeed, looking\nat the COVER panel, the four galaxies give similar results\nup to cover=0.5; IRAS F11255-4120 deviates significantly\nfor COVER=0.3. IRAS F21453-3511 seems to be sensitive\nto the galaxy center but it maintains within the region of\nhigh-asymmetries in all the (extreme) cases considered. As\nshown, the choice of free or fixed position angle \u0393 or flattening q do not affect so much the final results. In par4\nFor instance, COVER = 0.7 means that if less than 70% of\nthe points along an ellipse are not covered by data the program\nstops. This value makes sure that kinematic coefficients are robust. Sometimes it is necessary to relax this condition especially\nwhen reconstructing maps. See further details in Krajnovi\u0107 et al.\n(2006).\n\n11\n\n\fBellocchi et al.: Kinematic asymmetries of disks and post-coalescence mergers\n\n4.3.2. Monte Carlo simulations\nIn order to analyze the dependence of the kinemetry results to the uncertainties in the radial velocities and velocity\ndispersion values, we measure the probability distribution\nfunction (PDFs) of the asymmetries in these systems using\nMonte Carlo (MC) simulations, as done in S08, since the\nkinemetry method does not lend itself to a straightforward\nerror propagation.\nTherefore, for each template, we create 150 different realizations of the moment maps (i.e., velocity field and velocity dispersion) based on their corresponding error maps.\nThese error maps correspond to the measurement errors of\nthe velocity moments, as derived when fitting the kinematics from the data cube along with wavelength calibration\nerrors, as explained in section 2.4. For each moment map\nwe perturb the observed data points by randomizing them,\nusing Gaussian noise parameterized by the measured 1\u03c3 errors. The new maps created are then used to rerun kinemetry and apply the analysis described before. In figure 11 the\nresults are shown. They show that the results in the [\u03c3a va ] plane are stable to the velocity errors, with relatively\nwell defined regions for disks and merger galaxies.\n\nFig. 10. Results for the asymmetry measures when different\nsets of input parameters are considered with 10 harmonic terms\nanalysis. Symbol types and colors distinguish among the different systems as explain in the legend. In each panel one parameter\nat a time is changed: respectively, COVER, \u0393 (or PA), q and the\nCENTER of the ellipses. On the top-left: Different results for the\nCOVER parameter (i.e., 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) where the size of the\nsymbol is proportional to the COVER value (the biggest symbol corresponds to the highest cover value and vice versa). On\nthe top-right: The results obtained considering a position angle\n\u0393 free to vary (filled symbols) or fixed to its mean value (empty\nsymbols) are shown. On the bottom-left: The results shown are\nobtained when considering q free to vary and constant with the\nradius to its mean value. On the bottom-right: Results achieved\nchoosing 5 different centers for each galaxy: filled symbols represent results obtained from the 'standard' analysis (H\u03b1 flux\npeak), empty symbols the results from shifting their center of 1\npixel (horizontally and vertically, with respect to the H\u03b1 peak\npixel corresponding to a shift of 0.95\u2032\u2032 ).\n\nticular the computed asymmetries are quite insensitive to\nthe choice for q, especially for the class 0 galaxies. In general, the results obtained with a fixed \u0393 / q are somewhat\nhigher due to the fact that there is less degree of freedom\nsuch that the asymmetries cannot be well accounted by the\nfitting. Obviously the proper choice of free / fixed parameters depends on the level of S/N (i.e., if the deviations are\nassociated to a true feature or noise).\nAccording to these results we have selected the following set of input parameters for the remainder analysis (i.e.,\nCOVER = 0.7, \u0393 is completely free to vary and q free to\nvary in the range [0.2 \u2212 1], center = H\u03b1 flux peak).\n12\n\n4.4. Total kinematic asymmetry of disk, on-going and\npost-coalescence merger systems\nAs done in S08 we compute the total kinematic asymmetry Ktot border in order to separate class 0 (disks) and\nclass 2 (post-coalescence merger) objects. For the four objects we obtained a mean value of < Ktot >= 0.135: this\nis a significant lower value than that obtained in S08 (i.e.,\n< Ktot >= 0.5). The difference could arise from the fact\nthat our mergers are in a post-coalescence phase showing\nrelaxation in the innermost regions with a large rotation\ncomponent, while in S08 they are mostly pre-coalescence\nmerger systems dominated by dispersion. Also, the limit defined in S08 comes out after excluding IRAS 12112+0305, a\npre-coalescence merger pair (i.e., Garc\u0131\u0301a-Mar\u0131\u0301n et al. 2009)\nthat looks like a disk at high redshift. If the classification\nof this object is considered, the total kinematic asymmetry\nborder derived for the whole S08 sample would have been\nconsiderably lower (i.e., < Ktot >\u223c 0.3, see Figure 5 in S08)\nand therefore the discrepancy with our finding reduced.\nIn any case, the fact that the border disk/merger for\nthe S08 sample is so dependent on the classification of a\nsingle object (i.e., IRAS 12112+0305) illustrates its relatively large associated uncertainties. A reduction of the total asymmetry border Ktot , as our results (and S08, after\nreclassifying IRAS 12112+0305) suggests, would imply that\nthe relative frequency of disks and mergers in a given sample changes, increasing the fraction of mergers. Changing\nthe relative frequencies of disk/merger have obvious implications when interpreting the data in terms of the different evolutionary scenario mentioned in the introduction.\nOn the other hand our sample is admittedly too small and\nformed by objects with relatively homogeneous properties\n(i.e., LIRGs classified as disks and post-coalescence mergers) for a robust determination of general use. Therefore,\nfurther efforts to constrain its value as well as to understand\nhow it depends on several instrumental and observational\nfactors are required.\n\n\fBellocchi et al.: Kinematic asymmetries of disks and post-coalescence mergers\n\ntype), the inner regions5 of the galaxy are usually affected\nby more chaotic motions, as revealed by a quite irregular\nrotational curve and higher order deviations (i.e., k5 /k1 ) at\nsmall radii. As the major merger evolves, the inner regions\nrapidly relax into a rotating disk, while the outer parts are\nstill out of equilibrium. This implies that the velocity field\nin a post-coalescence system could be dominated by rotation in the inner regions with large kinematic asymmetries\nin the outer parts, as it is actually observed in our systems.\nProvided that the outer regions retain better the memory\nof a merger event, we propose a criterion which enhances\nthe relative importance of the asymmetries at larger radii.\nIndeed, instead of simply averaging the asymmetries\nover all radii (as in S08), these are weighted according to the\nnumber of data points used in their determination. Since\nthe number of data points of the outer ellipses is larger\nthan for the inner ones, the asymmetries found in the outer\nellipses contribute more significantly to the average for obtaining vasym and \u03c3asym . As the number of data points is\nin first approximation proportional to the circumference of\nthe ellipse, for practical reasons we used this to weight the\nasymmetries found for the different ellipses.\nThe circumferences of the ellipses are computed using\nthe truncated 'infinite sum'\np formula, that is a function of\nthe ellipticity (i.e., e = 1 \u2212 q 2 ) and the semi major axis\nof the ellipse (r):\n\"\n\u00132 4 #\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u00132\ne\n1\n*\n3\n1\n(5)\ne2 \u2212\n*\nC(e, r) \u2248 2\u03c0r 1 \u2212\n2\n2*4\n3\nThe final formula to compute the weighted velocity and\nvelocity dispersion asymmetries are respectively:\n!\nN\nv\nX\nkavg,n\n1\n(6)\n* Cn * PN\nvasym =\nv\nB1,n\nn=1\nn=1 Cn\n\u03c3asym =\n\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\nFig. 11.

A new criterion to distinguish kinematic asymmetries\nbetween post-coalescence mergers from disks\nIn order to better assess the presence of asymmetries in the\nkinematic maps we will explore a new kinematic criterion.\nAs described in Kronberger et al. (2007), when considering recent (i.e., \u2264 100 Myr after the first encounter) or ongoing major mergers of equal mass galaxies (i.e., Milky Way\n\n\u03c3\nkavg,n\n* Cn\nv\nB1,n\n\n!\n\n* PN\n\n1\n\nn=1\n\nCn\n\n(7)\n\nwhere N is the total number of radii considered, Cn the\nvalue of the circumference for a given ellipse, the different\nkn (kvn and k\u03c3n ) are the deviations concerning respectively\nthe velocity field and velocity dispersion maps, while B1v is\nthe rotational curves. We will refer to this approach as the\n'weighted' method and its associated plane W-[\u03c3a - va ]).\nIn Fig. 12 the results in the W-[\u03c3a - va ] plane for our four\ngalaxies are shown where MC have been performed similarly as above (Sect. 4.3.2).\nThe results follow the same general trend but the two\nclasses are separated somewhat better than in the unweighted case (Sec. 4.3). Indeed, for class 0 objects the\nweighted velocity asymmetries are lower while, for class 2\nobjects are somewhat higher than in the [\u03c3a - va ] plane.\nTherefore, it enhances the fact that post-coalescence mergers have larger deviations at larger radii with respect to\npure rotational motions while disks have still lower deviations than those obtained using [\u03c3a - va ]. In this case, the\n5\n\nIf a galaxy covers a FoV of 30 kpc \u00d7 30 kpc, the regions more\naffected by chaotic motions are those at galactocentric distances\nsmaller than 10 kpc.\n13\n\n\fBellocchi et al.: Kinematic asymmetries of disks and post-coalescence mergers\n\ntotal kinematic asymmetry border, which distinguishes the\ntwo disks and the two post-coalescence mergers, is characterized by a mean value of 0.146.\n\nfields as a function of redshift (i.e., 0 < z < 1). They found\nthat for large (Milky Way type) galaxies the distortions are\nstill visible at intermediate redshifts but partially smeared\nout, while for small galaxies even strong distortions are not\nvisible in the velocity field at z \u2248 0.5.\nGon\u00e7alves et al. (2010), simulating LBAs at redshift\nz \u223c 2, found that, in general, galaxies at high redshift\npresent smaller values of Kasym , i.e., they appear more\ndisky than they actually are. The percentage of galaxies\nclassified as mergers drop from \u223c 70 % to \u223c 38 % from\nz = 0 to z = 3 according to their simulations.\nIn order to investigate the resolution effects on our results we simulate to 'observe' these systems at z = 3 with\na typical pixel scale of 0.1\u2032\u2032 (the same pixel scale of the\nIFU NIRSpec/JWST). At this redshift the current FoV of\nour images is about 1\u2032\u2032 x 1\u2032\u2032 with a typical scale of 7.83\nkpc/arcsec, assuming a \u039bDCM cosmology with H0 = 70\nkm/s/Mpc, \u03a9M = 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.7. The simulated maps\nare shown in Fig. 13. We apply kinemetry using these maps\nand, following the same procedures as before, obtain the\nresults shown in the [\u03c3a - va ] (Fig. 14) and W-[\u03c3a - va ]\n(Fig. 15) planes. The [\u03c3a - va ] plane shows the expected\ntrend, where both classes appear more symmetric when observed at high redshift. In this case a lower value of the total\nkinematic asymmetry Kasym border is derived (red dashed\nline), as expected (i.e., Kasym = 0.096). Thus, shifting the\nsample from z = 0 to z = 3, the frontier between disks /\npost-coalescence mergers in the [\u03c3a - va ] plane changes from\n0.135 to 0.096.\nThe W-[\u03c3a - va ] plane is less sensitive to resolution effects after redshifting our sample at z = 3 (see Fig. 15). This\nis due to the fact that the larger / outer regions are the ones\nless affected by resolution effects. As with this criterion the\nassociated asymmetries weight more than those present at\ninner radii, the computed asymmetries (i.e., vasym , \u03c3asym )\nare less affected by resolution. Therefore, the total kinematic asymmetry distinguishing the two classes changes\nonly from 0.146 to 0.130 between z = 0 and z = 3.\n\nFig. 12. On the top: Weighted asymmetry measures of the\n(w)\n\n(w)\n\nvelocity vasym and velocity dispersion \u03c3asym fields as derived\nfrom the Monte Carlo realizations for the four objects. For each\nsource 150 MC simulations are run but only the \u00b13\u03c3 results are\nshown. The solid red line indicates the empirical division between disks and post-coalescence mergers at < Ktot > = 0.146.\nOn the bottom: The probability distribution function (PDFs)\nas derived from MC realizations. The empirical delineation Klim\n= 0.146 can well separate the two classes along with a large range\nof other values (i.e., dashed Klim area).\n\n4.6. Angular resolution / Redshift dependence\nThe angular resolution effects on the distortions of the velocity fields produced by mergers have been discussed by\nKronberger et al. (2007) on the basis of simulated velocity\n14\n\nSummarizing, resolution effects tend to smooth kinematic deviations making objects to appear more disky than\nthey actually are. This effects are more significant when\nanalyzing the kinematic asymmetries in the (unweighted)\n[\u03c3a -va ] plane than in the W-[\u03c3a - va ] one. In particular,\nwhen compared our local seeing limited observations with\nsimulated data at z = 3 (and 0.1\u2032\u2032 /spaxel), the total kinematic asymmetry border value is reduced by a 30% from\nz = 0 to z = 3 in the [\u03c3a - va ] plane, while it is only shifted\nby 11% in the W-[\u03c3a - va ] plane.\nComparing our results with those obtained in S08 when\nconsidering local spirals and toy-disk models as observed\nat high redshift, we notice that the low value of our Ktot\n(\u223c 0.1) classifies those galaxies as mergers and, on the\nother hand, the frontier defined in S08 classifies our postcoalescence mergers and IRAS F12112+0305 as disks. This\nillustrates that the definition of merger is a crucial point\nto define the asymmetry frontier. Indeed, a lower value of\nthe fraction merger/disk (i.e., a higher value of the Ktot\nparameter) can be derived if only pre-coalescence on-going\nmergers are considered as 'true' mergers. The weighted criterion proposed here should be applied to larger and more\ndiverse samples in order to understand the uncertainties\nassociated to this type of classifications.\n\n\fBellocchi et al.: Kinematic asymmetries of disks and post-coalescence mergers\nIRAS F11255\u22124120\n\u03c3 H\u03b1 [km/sec]\n\nFlux H\u03b1\n\nv H\u03b1\n103\n\n2.1\n0.5\n\narcsec\n\n0.5\n1.3\n\n80\n\n0.4\n\n56\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n4981\n4917\n0.0\n\n\u22120.4\n\n0.0\narcsec\n\n5045\n0.5\n\n32\n\n\u22121.2\n\n4853\n\n8\n0.0\n\n4789\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\narcsec\n\n0.5\n\narcsec\n\nIRAS F10567\u22124310\n\u03c3 H\u03b1 [km/sec]\n\nFlux H\u03b1\n2.2\n\n0.5\n\nv H\u03b1\n58\n\n0.5\n\narcsec\n\n1.6\n1.0\n\n0.0\n\n37\n\n0.0\n\n0.3\n\u22120.5\n0.0\narcsec\n\n0.5\n\n\u22120.3\n\n5281\n\n0.5\n\n48\n\n5215\n5150\n\n0.0\n\n26\n\u22120.5\n\n15\n0.0\n\n5085\n\u22120.5\n\n0.5\n\n5019\n0.0\n\narcsec\n\n0.5\n\narcsec\n\nIRAS F04315\u22120840\n\u03c3 H\u03b1 [km/sec]\n\nFlux H\u03b1\n3.4\n\n0.5\n\nv H\u03b1\n141\n\n0.5\n\narcsec\n\n2.4\n1.4\n\n0.0\n\n112\n82\n\n0.0\n\n0.4\n\u22120.5\n0.0\narcsec\n\n0.5\n\n\u22120.6\n\n4908\n\n0.5\n\n4840\n4772\n\n0.0\n\n53\n\u22120.5\n\n24\n0.0\n\n4704\n\u22120.5\n\n0.5\n\n4636\n0.0\n\narcsec\n\n0.5\n\narcsec\n\nFig. 14.

Conclusions\nThis paper presents the results from spatially resolved kinematics of four local (z \u223c 0.016) luminous infrared galaxies (i.e., LIRGs) observed with the VLT/VIMOS IFU as\npart of a larger project to characterize the properties of\n(U)LIRGs on the basis of optical and infrared Integral Field\nSpectroscopy. The four galaxies are at a similar distance\n(\u223c 70 Mpc) and, on the basis of its morphology, two of\nthem have been classified as isolated disks and two as postcoalescence merger objects (see Paper III). The velocity\nfield and velocity dispersion maps are analyzed with the\naim of studying in detail their kinematics. The kinemetry\nmethod (developed by Krajnovi\u0107 and coworkers) is used\nto characterize the kinematic asymmetries of these galaxies and several criteria are discussed to distinguishing their\nstatus. We can draw the following conclusions from this\nstudy:\n\u2013 The general kinematic properties of the four LIRGs are\nconsistent with their morphological classification: iso-\n\nFig. 15.

The pattern of the 2D kinematic\nmaps of the secondary broad component for the two\npost-coalescence mergers (with kinematic axes perpendicular to those of the main component) further supports this interpretation. In the particular case of IRAS\nF04315-0840 the broad component is found over a quite\nextended area (\u223c 2.4 kpc x 2.7 kpc);\nThe vc /\u03c3c parameter classifies our sources as rotation\ndominated. Similar results are obtained when using the\nquantity vshear /\u03a3. This shows that our post-coalescence\nmergers have a large rotation component and the sole\nuse of these parameters does not allow us to discriminate\ntheir kinematic differences with respect to disks;\nWhen the full 2D kinematics information provided by\nthe spatially resolved velocity field and velocity dispersion maps is considered, the kinematic asymmetries are\nwell characterized with kinemetry, making the morphological and kinematic classification consistent for the\nfour objects. Disks have lower kinematic asymmetries\nthan those derived for post-coalescence mergers;\nWe have explored a new criterion to characterize the\nkinematic asymmetries using kinemetry. In particular, we introduce a new weighting method which gives\nweight to the kinematics of the outer regions when computing the total asymmetries vasym and \u03c3asym . This\nis motivated by the fact that post-coalescence mergers\nshow relatively small kinematic asymmetries in the inner parts as a consequence of the rapid relaxation into\na rotating disk, with the outer parts being still out of\nequilibrium (i.e., larger asymmetries). The fact that the\n'frontier' between disks and post-coalescence systems\nonly changes by 11% when considering the local and\nhigh-z cases suggests that this new criterion is less dependent on angular resolution effects. Thus, the W-[\u03c3a\n- va ] plane differentiate in a more robust way disks and\npost-coalescence mergers.\nClassifying disk/merger systems using kinemetry is\ndifficult, and it obviously depends on the definition of\nmerger. The 'asymmetry frontier' strongly depends on\nthe 'type' of mergers considered: if only pre-coalescence\non-going mergers are considered as 'true' mergers a\nlower value of the fraction merger/disk systems can\nbe derived. The weighted criterion proposed here helps\nto characterize in a more robust way post-coalescence\nasymmetries.\nUsing previous criteria to classify disks/mergers, our\ntwo post-coalescence systems would have been classified as disks. This suggests that the ratio of mergers to\ndisks systems at high-z may have been underestimated.\nLarger and more diverse samples are required to confirm\nthis conclusion.\n\n\fTable 3.

Indeed, other authors tried to find out criteria able to kinematically classify\ngalaxies at intermediate redshift (i.e., z \u223c 0.6): for example,\nFlores et al. (2006) developed a simple kinematic classification scheme for distant galaxies based on their 3D kinematics and their morphology in the ACS F775W images. They\nmodel the velocity field of a rotating disk that matches the\nobserved velocity gradient to obtain the expected \u03c3-map\ncorresponding to the observed velocity field and then compare the observed and model \u03c3-maps, estimating whether\nthe observed kinematics are consistent or not with a rotating disk (i.e., a rotating disk should show a well defined\npeak in the center of the \u03c3 map). The spatial separation\n(\u2206r, in pixel) between the peaks in the two \u03c3-maps and\nthe relative difference (\u01eb) between the amplitudes of the\nmodeled and observed \u03c3 peaks are considered to classify\nthe objects. They found that rotating disks have locations\nnear \u2206r \u223c \u01eb \u223c 0, while galaxies with anomalous velocity\nfields are clearly offset. The same criterion has been applied\nin Yang et al. (2008).\nHere we propose some criteria, based again on the\nkinemetry method:\n1. In this case we consider the normalized higher order deviations <k5 / k1 >v of the velocity field with respect to\nthose of the velocity dispersion map \u03c3asym , since the k5\nterm indicates complex structure in the velocity map,\nas noticed in Krajnovi\u0107 et al. (2006). Small k5 /k1 values should be found in disk-like structures while high\nk5 /k1 are expected for mergers, where more complex\nstructures are supposed to exists. This is confirmed by\nour results: class 0 objects have <k5 / k1 > close to zero,\nthe amplitude of k1 is substantial, the position angle \u0393\nand flattening q remain quite constant such that they\ncan be classified as disk-like objects. On the other hand,\nclass 2 objects show a rise of the <k5 / k1 > term up\nto 0.6 at outer radii, where peculiar structures can be\nidentified. In Fig. A.1 the results obtained from applying MC simulations (150 for each object). This criterion\nallows to distinguish the class 0 / 2 in similar way as in\n\n\fBellocchi et al.: Kinematic asymmetries of disks and post-coalescence mergers\n\nmap and the mean values of the B1,v term over all the\nradii. The next formula describes the two asymmetries:\n\u001c\n\u001d\nRM S\nk1,\u03c3\nvasym =\n\u03c3asym =\nhB1,v i r\nB1,v r\n\nthe [\u03c3a - va ] plane, but somewhat worst than in W-[\u03c3a\n- va ] plane.\n\nwhere the RM S gives an estimate of the deviations of\nthe system from the ideal case of simple rotation in the\nsystem6 . In Fig. A.2 the results in S - [\u03c3a - va ] plane\nare shown. Comparing this plot with that shown in Fig.\n9, we notice that the RMS/<B1 > term tends to be\n3terms\nhigher than the vasym values while the \u03c3asym\nrange\n10terms\n3terms\nsmaller than the \u03c3asym\nrange. The \u03c3asym\ndoes not\nseem to characterize well the kinematic asymmetries of\nthese systems (i.e., quite distorted for the IRAS F043150840). On the other hand, the RMS/<B1 > term by itself can distinguish the two classes relatively well, where\na border dividing them can be estimated with a value\nof \u223c 0.2.\n\nFig. A.1. On the top: Asymmetry measures of the <k5 /k1 >\n(w)\n\nterm and velocity dispersion \u03c3asym as derived from the Monte\nCarlo realizations for the four objects. For each source 150 MC\nsimulations are run but the \u00b13\u03c3 results are shown. The solid red\nline indicates the empirical division between disks and mergers\nat <Klim > = 0.085. On the bottom: The probability distribution function (PDFs) as derived from the respective MC realizations. The empirical delineation well separate the two classes\ndefining a small range of possible values (i.e., Klim area). Small\ndeviations <k5 /k1 > are found for disks while higher values for\nmergers, consistent with our expectation.\n\n2. In some cases the data quality does not allow us to\napply sophisticated criteria to look for asymmetries. In\nthese cases a simple criterion may be the only possible\noption. Therefore, we have studied the potential of the\nSimple-[\u03c3a - va ] plane (hereafter, S-[\u03c3a - va ]), where\nonly the first order correction in the harmonic expansion\nis considered and asymmetries are defined as the ratio\nbetween the root mean square (RMS) of the residual\n\nFig. A.2. Subtracting the circular motion (i.e., B1 coefficient)\nfrom the data we end up with the velocity residual maps, characterized by mean residuals close to zero and RMS lower than\n20 km/s for the whole sample. Having the four objects almost\nthe same RMS, this plot clearly implies higher circular velocities\nfor the class 0 galaxies while lower B1 term is derived for the\nclass 2 ones. Their rotation is well shown in Figs. (5 - 8).\n\n6\n\nResiduals are from measured velocities and B1 coefficient.\n19\n\n\f"}
