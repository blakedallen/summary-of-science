The continuum emission comes from a \u223c 3\u2032\u2032 diameter structure whose elongation is approximately\neast-west and whose centroid is coincident within the astrometric errors with the\nbrightest X-ray and rest-UV peak (L1). The line data show that this structure is\nmost likely a rapidly rotating disk. Its rotation velocity of \u2265 420 km s\u22121 implies\na total dynamical mass of \u2265 3 \u00d7 1011 sin\u22122 i h\u22121\n0.7 M\u2299 within an intrinsic radius of\n\u22121\n8 h0.7 kpc, most of which is plausibly in the form of stars and gas.

Surveys\nwith ISOCAM at 15 \u03bcm, SCUBA at 850 \u03bcm, and MAMBO at 1200 \u03bcm suggest that this\nbackground is dominated by luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ([U]LIRGs: LIR \u223c\n1011.5 \u2212 1013 L\u2299 ) at z \u2265 1 (e.g., Smail, Ivison, & Blain 1997; Hughes et al. 1998; Barger,\nCowie, & Sanders 1999; Aussel et al. 1999, 2000; Carilli et al. 2001; Elbaz et al. 2002;\nGenzel & Cesarsky 2000). Faint submillimeter sources frequently have only weak (if any)\ncounterparts in the rest-frame UV and optical, however (Smail et al. 2000, 2002; Dannerbauer\net al. 2002). Redshifts and spectroscopic parameters have thus far been confirmed with CO\ninterferometry for only three of the > 102 detected systems (Blain et al. 2002, and references\ntherein).\nOne of these three sources is SMM J02399-0136 (hereafter J02399), the brightest of the\n15 significant background sources discovered in the SCUBA cluster lens survey (SCLS: Smail\net al. 1997, 2002). This galaxy's 850 \u03bcm flux density of 23.0 mJy includes a magnification\nfactor of 2.45 due to the z = 0.37 foreground cluster Abell 370 (Ivison et al. 1998; R. Ivison,\nprivate communication). For a dust temperature of 45 K and emissivity index \u03b2 = 1.5\n(typical for local luminous IRAS galaxies: Dunne et al. 2000), its intrinsic IR luminosity\n8\n(from 8 \u2212 1000 \u03bcm in the rest frame) is LIR = 1.2 \u00d7 1013 h\u22122\n0.7 L\u2299 . J02399 is rich in gas as\nwell as dust: Frayer et al. (1998) detect strong CO(3\u20132) emission at zCO = 2.808, slightly\nredward of its UV line emission at zUV = 2.803 (Ivison et al. 1998). The optical through\nX-ray properties of J02399 resemble those of local type 2 AGN and broad absorption line\nQSOs (Ivison et al. 1998; Vernet & Cimatti 2001). Moderately broad (2000 km s\u22121 ) Ly \u03b1\nemission is extended over about 13\u2032\u2032 , with a maximum on the brightest UV continuum peak\nL1, and a second maximum on the UV continuum peak L2 lying \u223c 3\u2032\u2032 farther east (Ivison\net al. 1998; Vernet & Cimatti 2001). Bautz et al. (2000) find that strong X-ray emission\nfrom a compact nucleus is obscured by a column of \u223c 1024 cm\u22122 and estimate an unabsorbed\n\u22121\nX-ray luminosity of 2.7 \u00b1 1.0 \u00d7 1044 h\u22122\n0.7 erg s . The ratios of X-ray, far-IR, and radio fluxes\nsuggest that 15\u201370% of the bolometric (infrared) luminosity may come from the AGN (Bautz\net al. 2000; Frayer et al. 1998), as is true for composite starburst/AGN members of the local\nULIRG population like Mkn 231 (Sanders & Mirabel 1996; Genzel et al. 1998).\n8\n\nThis paper assumes a flat \u03a9\u039b = 0.7 cosmology with H0 = 70 h0.7 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , for which zCO = 2.808\n\u22121\ncorresponds to a luminosity distance DL = 23.5 h\u22121\n0.7 Gpc and an angular diameter distance DA = 1.6 h0.7 Gpc.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nWe observed J02399 with the B, C, and D configurations of the IRAM Plateau de Bure\ninterferometer (PdBI: Guilloteau et al. 1992) in November \u2013 December 1998 and in January \u2013 September 2002. In 1998, the array consisted of five 15 m telescopes, each equipped\nwith both [single-sideband] 3 mm and [double-sideband] 1 mm SIS receivers which we used\nsimultaneously. System temperatures (referred to above the atmosphere) were \u223c 120 K and\n\u223c 400 K at 3 mm and 1 mm, respectively. We tuned the 3 mm receivers to 90.81 GHz, the\nfrequency of the redshifted CO(3\u20132) line for zCO = 2.808, and the 1 mm receivers to a\nline-free region at 235.00 GHz corresponding to a rest wavelength of 335 \u03bcm. Four correlator modules were deployed to sample the full 536 MHz of contiguous 3 mm bandwidth at\n2.5 MHz channel\u22121 resolution, while the remaining two modules provided 295 MHz of 1 mm\ncontinuum bandwidth. By 2002, the array had expanded to six telescopes, eight correlator\nmodules, and a wider IF bandwidth. We therefore retuned the 1 mm receivers to 211.83 GHz,\nthe frequency of the redshifted CO(7\u20136) line, and deployed four correlator modules (giving\n559 MHz of continuous bandwidth) at both 3 mm and 1 mm. The pointing center was also\nchanged by 0.91\u2032\u2032 for the 2002 observations, to agree with the CO(3\u20132) centroid (\u03b1 (J2000)\n= 02h 39m 51.89s and \u03b4 (J2000) = \u221201\u25e6 35\u2032 59.9\u2032\u2032 ) measured by Frayer et al. (1998).\nWe calibrated the 1998 and 2002 data separately using the CLIC routines in the IRAM\nGILDAS package (Guilloteau & Lucas 2000). Passband calibration used one or more bright\nquasars. Phase and amplitude variations within each track were calibrated out by interleaving reference observations of one or two quasars near the source every 30 minutes. The overall\nflux scale for each epoch was set by comparisons of model sources CRL618 and MWC349\nwith bright quasars whose flux densities are regularly monitored at both the PdBI and the\nIRAM 30 m telescope. Once the source data were calibrated, we precessed the 1998 visibilities to the 2002 phase center. After confirming our nondetection of CO(7\u20136) emission, we\nrescaled the 2002 1 mm continuum visibilities from 211.83 to 235.00 GHz using a power law\nindex of 3 derived from (sub)millimeter photometry (Ivison et al. 1998; Smail et al. 2002).\nWe then combined the 1998 and 2002 uv data, yielding a total of 40 distinct baselines (24\u2013\n331 m) from the three array configurations, and smoothed the CO(3\u20132) data to 15 km s\u22121\nresolution. After flagging bad and high phase noise data, we were left with the [on-source,\nsix-antenna array] equivalents of 39.6 hours of 3 mm data and 21.6 hours of 1 mm data. We\ndeconvolved the data cubes with natural weighting using the CLEAN algorithm as implemented in the NRAO AIPS package (van Moorsel, Kemball, & Greisen 1996) and GILDAS.\nAlthough no 3 mm (rest-frame 840 \u03bcm) continuum emission was seen, both the CO(3\u20132) line\nand the [rest-frame] 335 \u03bcm continuum emission are well detected and resolved in our maps.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n3.\n3.1.\n\nResults\n\nContinuum emission\n\nFigure 1 shows the 335 \u03bcm (\u03bbobs = 1.27 mm) continuum emission from J02399 at a\nresolution of 1.8\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 1.4\u2032\u2032 , superposed on a sub-arcsecond resolution R-band image obtained\nat Keck (L. Cowie, private communication). The observed total flux density of 7.0 \u00b1 1.2 mJy\n(\u00b11.4 mJy for a 20% uncertainty in the flux scale) agrees well with the value (8.5 mJy)\nexpected from JCMT photometry at 850 and 1350 \u03bcm, suggesting that the interferometer\nhas resolved out little if any emission. The central continuum structure is clearly resolved in\nthe east-west direction, parallel to the dominant lensing shear predicted by the SCLS lensing\nmodel (R. Ivison, private communication). A fit to the uv visibilities yields FWHM diameters\nof 3.2\u2032\u2032 (east-west) and \u2264 0.8\u2032\u2032 (north-south); correcting the former for magnification by a\nfactor of M = 2.45 implies a source-plane linear size of \u223c 10 h\u22121\n0.7 kpc. An additional tail of\n\u2032\u2032\nemission extending \u2265 4 WSW from the central peak may be associated with extended Ly \u03b1\nemission detected by Vernet & Cimatti (2001), and with another fainter R-band emission\npeak (Figure 1). The \u223c 10 h\u22121\n0.7 kpc size of the central dust source in J02399 is about three\ntimes larger than the sizes of local ULIRGs (Downes & Solomon 1998; Bryant & Scoville\n1999). This fact may not be surprising, however, given that J02399 is about ten times\nmore luminous than the typical local ULIRG. Since the star-forming interstellar medium in\nULIRGs is thought to consist of a high volume filling factor distribution of dense gas and\ndust (Downes & Solomon 1998; Sakamoto et al. 1999), a ten times larger star formation rate\nrequires a ten times larger volume of star-forming regions.\nTable 1 summarizes the absolute positions and astrometric errors of the emission peak\nof J02399 in the different wavebands. The coincidence of the far-IR centroid with the UV\nand X-ray continuum peaks within the combined astrometric uncertainties of \u223c 1\u2032\u2032 suggests\nthat L1 is indeed the primary origin of J02399's dust emission. The (bluer) UV continuum\nand Ly \u03b1 emission peak L2, in contrast, has no associated dust emission; this supports the\nidea that L2 is primarily scattered AGN light from L1 (Vernet & Cimatti 2001), rather than\na second galaxy in the early stages of a merger with L1 (Ivison et al. 1998). In fact, there\nmay be an anticorrelation between the fainter rest UV emission and the 335 \u03bcm continuum\nemission, suggesting that extinction strongly affects the short-wavelength morphology of\nthe source. UV emission may only escape from \"extinction holes\" in the extremely dusty\nenvironment of J02399, a scenario also suggested by Ivison et al. (2001) in their study of the\ndusty high-redshift SCUBA source SMM J14011+0252 (hereafter J14011).\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n3.2.\n\nCO line emission\n\nFigure 2 shows the velocity-integrated CO(3\u20132) line emission (\u03bbobs = 3.30 mm) at a\nresolution of 5.2\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 2.4\u2032\u2032 in greyscale, with the continuum contours of Figure 1 overlaid.\nTaking into account the different spatial resolutions, the distributions and centroids of the\nvelocity-integrated CO(3\u20132) and 335 \u03bcm continuum emission are coincident, and the peak\nCO emission (like the peak continuum) originates in the eastern (blue-shifted) emission peak.\nThe UV/X-ray source L1 is located 0.7\u2032\u2032 \u00b1 0.6\u2032\u2032 from the rotation center. Figure 3 shows the\nCO(3\u20132) line profile, smoothed to 60 km s\u22121 and integrated over the central \u223c 5\u2032\u2032 . Figure\n4 displays channel maps of the CO(3\u20132) emission (spaced by 200 km s\u22121 ) at a resolution\nof 5.2\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 2.4\u2032\u2032 . Our new data agree with and significantly improve on the earlier 7\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 5\u2032\u2032\ninterferometry of Frayer et al. (1998). The molecular line emission of J02399 is very broad\nand has a symmetric \"double-horn\" profile which is characteristic of rotation. Line emission\nextends over more than 1100 km s\u22121 (FWHM), and the global profile shows emission peaks\nat \u2212520 km s\u22121 and +230 km s\u22121 (relative to the assumed zCO = 2.808). An improved CO\nsystemic redshift for the source would thus be 2.8076 \u00b1 0.0002. Channel maps show that\nblue and red-shifted emission maxima originate 1.5\u2032\u2032 \u2212 2\u2032\u2032 on either side of the phase center,\nagain consistent with rotation. The largest velocity gradient is along a position angle \u223c 115\u25e6 ,\ni.e., close to the direction of the elongation of the continuum emission. In addition to this\nregular behavior, there also appears to be highly blueshifted emission (in the \u2212600 km s\u22121\nchannel) northwest of the center. We interpret the line profiles and channel maps as showing\nrapid rotation about a position very near the phase center. Taken together, the line and\ncontinuum data indicate that the most likely morphology of the source is a disk of molecular\ngas and dust rotating about a central AGN located at the position of the hard X-ray peak.\nThe absolute astrometry renders unlikely but does not exclude an alternative configuration\nof two galaxies orbiting each other, in which the AGN coincides with either the red or the\nblue-shifted CO(3\u20132) emission peak.\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nJ02399 is a very massive galaxy\n\nIn what follows, we assume that the molecular gas in J02399 is indeed distributed\nin a rotating disk. We have constructed ring/disk models with flat rotation curves to fit\nthe continuum and line profile data, including the effects of beam smearing and nonzero\nvelocity dispersions. The data are well fit (Figures 3 and 5) by a disk model with a (radially\nconstant) rotation velocity of 420\u00b120 km s\u22121 for an assumed inclination of i = 90\u25e6 . The broad\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nwings of the integrated line profile indicate that large local random motions (turbulence) are\npresent in the disk. The fit requires a ratio of local velocity dispersion to rotation velocity\nof \u223c 0.23, which is \u223c 2 \u2212 3 times larger than in the Milky Way disk but comparable to\nthat seen in local ULIRG mergers (Downes & Solomon 1998). A ring-like distribution with\na maximum gas density at r \u223c 1\u2032\u2032 on the sky (R = 3.2 h\u22121\n0.7 kpc in the source plane) and\n\u2206R(FWHM)/R \u223c 1 \u2212 1.5 provides a better match to the flux ratio of \u223c 2 between the\n\"horns\" and the central dip in the global spectrum than a filled, centrally-peaked disk.\nDownes & Solomon (1998) have found that similar rings on somewhat smaller scales are\ncharacteristic of the molecular gas distributions in local ULIRGs. The outer disk radius\nrequired by our model is r \u223c 2\u2032\u2032 \u2212 2.5\u2032\u2032 (R \u223c 6 \u2212 8 h\u22121\n0.7 kpc), in good agreement with our\ndirect fit to the 335 \u03bcm continuum source size. The enclosed dynamical mass inferred from\nthis disk model is\n\u0011 \u0010 M \u0011\u22121 \u0010\n\u00112 \u0010 sin i \u0011\u22122\n\u0010 r \u0011\u0010\nMdyn\nDA\nvrot\n= 1.3 \u00d7 1011 \u03b3 \u2032\u2032\n(1)\nM\u2299\n1\n2.45\n420 km s\u22121\n1.0\n1.6 h\u22121\n0.7 Gpc\nHere \u03b3 \u2264 1 is a dimensionless scale factor which depends on the disk/spheroid structure,\nand which for a thin disk in a massive spheroid is close to unity (Lequeux 1983). Within the\nr \u223c 2.5\u2032\u2032 outer radius of the molecular emission, the dynamical mass is \u223c 3.2 \u00d7 1011 h\u22121\n0.7 M\u2299 .\nIf a merger model is used instead of a rotating disk, the enclosed mass is approximately a\nfactor of two larger.\nThe integrated CO(3\u20132) flux from J02399 is 3.1 \u00b1 0.4 Jy km s\u22121 (\u00b10.3 Jy km s\u22121 for a\n10% uncertainty in the flux scale), in excellent agreement with the value of 3.0 Jy km s\u22121\nfound by Frayer et al. (1998). With this integrated flux and the assumption of moderately\ndense (nH2 \u226b 103 cm\u22123 ), thermalized gas at temperature & 30 K (see e.g., Combes, Maoli,\n& Omont 1999), the molecular (plus helium) gas mass can be estimated following Solomon\net al. (1997):\n\u00112 \u0010 1 + z \u0011\u22123\n\u0010 F\n\u0011\u22122 \u0010\n\u0011 \u0010 M \u0011\u22121 \u0010 \u03bd\nMgas\nDL\nCO\nobs\n= 1.60 \u00d7 1010 \u03b1\nM\u2299\nJy km s\u22121\n2.45\n90.81 GHz\n3.808\n23.5 h\u22121\n0.7 Gpc\n(2)\nHere \u03b1 is the conversion factor from CO luminosity to gas mass, which we assume to be\n\u223c 0.8\u22121.6 M\u2299 (K km s\u22121 pc2 )\u22121 , as estimated for local ULIRGs (Solomon et al. 1997; Downes\n& Solomon 1998). The inferred molecular gas mass in J02399 is thus 6.0 \u00b1 2.4 \u00d7 1010 h\u22122\n0.7 M\u2299 ,\n\u2032\u2032\nimplying a gas mass fraction of roughly 10\u201330% within r = 2.5 which is similar to those\nobserved in local ULIRGs (Downes & Solomon 1998).\nJ02399 is clearly a very massive system, and is in particular a very massive baryonic\nsystem. Observational studies of local ellipticals (Keeton 2001; Boriello, Salucci, & Danese\n2002; cf. Loewenstein & Mushotzky 2002) suggest that typically \u223c 30% of the total mass\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nwithin the optical effective radius will be dark; the interior regions of massive local disk\ngalaxies have similarly low dark matter fractions (Combes 2002). By analogy with these local\n\u22121\nsystems, J02399 should have a baryonic mass of \u2265 2 \u00d7 1011 sin\u22122 i h\u22121\n0.7 M\u2299 within 8 h0.7 kpc;\nMgas \u223c 6 \u00d7 1010 h\u22122\n0.7 M\u2299 then implies that a conservative lower limit to the stellar mass\nwithin the same radius is \u223c 1.4 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 (for i = 90\u25e6 ). The Kennicutt (1983) stellar initial\nmass function (IMF) models of Cole et al. (2001)9 imply that m\u2217 \u223c 7 \u00d7 1010 h\u22122\n0.7 M\u2299 for the\ngalaxy stellar mass function in the local Universe. Based on the stellar content of its inner\n\u2217\n\u2217\n8 h\u22121\n0.7 kpc, then, J02399 is already at least a 2m system, on its way to becoming a \u2265 3m\nsystem as it turns the remainder of its molecular gas into stars.\nOur new high-resolution observations of J02399 provide a fairly reliable estimate of the\ndynamical mass of a massive high-z galaxy. The more easily available observations of the\nionized gas kinematics are more prone to systematic bias and influences other than gravity\n(Pettini et al. 2001; Heckman et al. 2000). The presence of such a massive object at a\nredshift as high as \u223c 3 is qualitatively surprising, given that CDM models make the general\nprediction that galaxy masses build up gradually as a function of time and redshift, such\nthat the comoving density of massive objects at z \u223c 2 to 3 is only a small fraction of their\nlocal density (e.g., Kauffmann & Charlot 1998; Baugh et al. 2002). However, given the small\nnumber of objects whose kinematics have so far been studied with millimeter interferometry,\nthe question arises whether the detection of a few such massive objects is significant, or\nwhether they are mere items of curiosity.\nBesides J02399, the SCLS has yielded another source whose high redshift has been\nconfirmed by spatially resolved CO spectroscopy. J14011 at zCO = 2.565 has an observed\n850 \u03bcm flux density (12 mJy), a lensing magnification (2.5: Ivison et al. 2001), a bolometric\n10 \u22122\nluminosity (1.3 \u00d7 1013 h\u22122\n0.7 L\u2299 ), and a molecular gas mass (3.4 \u00d7 10 h0.7 M\u2299 ) which are\nsimilar to those of J02399 (Frayer et al. 1999; Ivison et al. 2001). The CO line width\nof J14011 (FWHM \u2206v = 190 km s\u22121 : Frayer et al. 1999; Downes & Solomon 2002) is\nmuch narrower than that of J02399 (FWHM \u2206v = 1100 km s\u22121 ), however. Although no\nclear rotation pattern has as yet been detected and no inclination correction can be made\non the basis of the available CO line and millimeter continuum maps (Frayer et al. 1999;\nDownes & Solomon 2002), the inclination must be less than 20\u25e6 for the dynamical mass to be\n\u2265 7 \u00d7 1010 h\u22121\n0.7 M\u2299 (i.e., at least twice the gas mass). If the complex UV source structure is\ntaken as evidence of a merger morphology, the dynamical mass would be \u2265 1.4\u00d71011 h\u22121\n0.7 M\u2299 .\nDownes & Solomon (2002) propose a disk model with a rotation velocity of 250 km s\u22121 , an\ninclination of 50\u25e6 , and an outer radius of 1.1\u2032\u2032 ; for these parameters and magnification by a\n9\n\nThe Kennicutt (1983) IMF is comparable in this context to a Salpeter (1955) IMF from mlower = 1 M\u2299 to\nmupper = 100 M\u2299. For a 0.1 \u2212 100 M\u2299 Salpeter IMF, Cole et al. (2001) find m\u2217 (z = 0) = 1.4 \u00d7 1011 h\u22122\n0.7 M\u2299 .\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nfactor M = 2.5, J14011's dynamical mass is 6 \u00d7 1010 h\u22121\n0.7 M\u2299 . Their further suggestion that\nJ14011 undergoes an additional factor of ten magnification by a previously unrecognized\nforeground galaxy (and that Mdyn is therefore a factor of ten lower) rests on the assumption\nthat the filling factor of CO emission within the 1.1\u2032\u2032 -radius structure is unity. Of the seven\nbackground SCLS sources with intrinsic S850 \u2265 4 mJy (before lensing magnification), then,\nthe two with known redshifts \u2265 2 both have likely baryonic masses in the & 1011 M\u2299 bin.\nThese source parameters are not atypical at high redshift: in a growing number of high-z\nQSOs and radio galaxies, millimeter CO interferometry reveals comparably large molecular\ngas masses (in several cases already \u2265 1011 h\u22122\n0.7 M\u2299 ) and a variety of linewidths (Guilloteau\net al. 1999; Papadopoulos et al. 2000; Cox et al. 2002, and references therein).\n\n4.2.\n\nCosmic volume densities of massive galaxies as a function of redshift\n\nFor our cosmology, the observed area covered by the SCLS (3.6 \u00d7 10\u22126 sr) and the\n1 \u2264 z \u2264 5 range sampled by the 850 \u03bcm observations correspond to a comoving volume\n3\nof 5.3 \u00d7 105 h\u22123\n0.7 Mpc . The effective comoving volume density corresponding to one source\nlike J02399 is thus \u03a6(M \u2265 1011 M\u2299 ) = 10\u22125.7 h30.7 Mpc\u22123 . Including J14011, this becomes\n10\u22125.4 h30.7 Mpc\u22123 ; including the four remaining SCLS sources with intrinsic S850 \u2265 4 mJy\nand unknown redshifts (on the assumption that they are also at z \u2265 1 and comparably\nmassive) boosts \u03a6 to 10\u22124.95 h30.7 Mpc\u22123 . Although the latter step is the most uncertain,\nevidence from the weakness of radio and optical/UV counterparts for submillimeter sources\nsuggests that these additional four sources are more likely to lie at high than at low redshifts\n(Dannerbauer et al. 2002; Ivison et al. 2002). Regardless of whether we assign one, two, or\nsix SCLS sources to the \u2265 1011 M\u2299 baryonic mass bin, however, we must adjust \u03a6 to reflect\nthe fact that not all massive objects will be detectable by SCUBA as \u223c 10 mJy sources at all\ntimes. For a Miller-Scalo (1979) IMF, or a 1 \u2212 100 M\u2299 Salpeter (1955) IMF, the bolometric\n(infrared) luminosity and star formation rate are related by (Kennicutt 1998)\nSFR\nLIR\n\u223c\nM\u2299 yr\u22121\n1.2 \u00d7 1010 L\u2299\n\n(3)\n\nsuch that the star formation rate in J02399 (for an assumed AGN contribution to LIR of\n50%) is about 500 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . Turning a total baryonic mass of \u223c 2 \u00d71011 M\u2299 into stars at this\nrate will require a total of \u223c 4 \u00d7 108 yr. Since the time elapsed over the range 1 \u2264 z \u2264 5 is\n\u223c 4.6 Gyr, correction for the finite starburst lifetime will increase the total \u03a6(M \u2265 1011 M\u2299 )\nby at least a factor of \u223c 11.5 over our estimates above. The correction factor can be higher\nstill if any of the past star formation in J02399 occurred in a quiescent mode, if the current\nburst will be terminated prematurely by strong negative feedback to the interstellar medium\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n(e.g., Genzel & Cesarsky 2000), or if the dark matter fraction within R = 8 h\u22121\n0.7 kpc is greater\nthan 30%.\nWe now consider the evolution of \u03a6(M \u2265 1011 M\u2299 ) with redshift. In the upper panel of\nFigure 6, we have plotted at z \u223c 2 \u2212 3 the comoving volume densities derived for two and six\nSCLS sources having baryonic masses \u2265 1011 M\u2299 ; upward arrows indicate a factor of 11.5\nstarburst lifetime correction. At z \u223c 1, we have plotted the volume densities of K-selected\nsystems with stellar masses \u2265 1011 h\u22122\n0.7 M\u2299 as inferred from a population synthesis analysis\nof Munich Near-Infrared Cluster Survey (MUNICS) sources by Drory et al. (2002). We also\nshow the volume densities of actively star-forming galaxies (S15 \u2265 300 \u03bcJy) detected in deep\nISOCAM surveys (Elbaz et al. 1999; Genzel & Cesarsky 2000). Rigopoulou et al. (2002)\nhave obtained H\u03b1 rotation curves for three of these systems and find dynamical masses\n\u2265 1011 h\u22121\n0.7 M\u2299 . Assuming that all ISOCAM galaxies with 15 \u03bcm flux densities \u2265 300 \u03bcm in\nthe redshift range 0.2 \u2264 z \u2264 1.3 (sampled by the spectroscopy of Rigopoulou et al. 2002)\nhave such masses, we derive a volume density of 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 h30.7 Mpc\u22123 . At z = 0, we show\nthe comoving volume density of systems with stellar masses \u2265 1011 h\u22122\n0.7 M\u2299 as obtained from\nmodelling optical and near-IR 2dF and 2MASS photometry (Cole et al. 2001).\nFor comparison with the observational data points, we also plot curves showing the predictions of two different semi-analytic models for galaxy evolution within a \u039bCDM structure\nformation cosmogony. For a representative \"Munich\" model, we count the number of galaxies with total stellar+gas mass \u2265 1011 M\u2299 in the catalogues of Kauffmann et al. (1999) and\n3\ndivide by the simulation volume of (200 h\u22121\n0.7 Mpc) ; the comoving densities are marginally\nhigher than those we would derive from counting only systems with stellar mass \u2265 1011 M\u2299 .\nFor a representative \"Durham\" model, we use a curve for stellar mass \u2265 1011 M\u2299 (C. Baugh,\nprivate communication) derived from a recent variation on the reference model of Cole et\nal. (2000). Although both Munich and Durham models adopt similar input parameters for\ntheir derivations of dark matter halo distributions (\u03a9M = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, h0.7 = 1, \u03c38 \u2243 0.9,\nand \u0393 \u2243 0.2), they treat baryons differently. Kauffmann et al. (1999) adopt a higher cosmic\nbaryon density (\u03a9b = 0.045 vs. 0.02), and the two groups use different recipes for star formation, feedback, and other physical processes. As a result, the models' predictions for the rate\nof assembly of systems with baryonic masses \u2265 Mmin = 1011 M\u2299 differ substantially at high\nredshifts, as previously noted by Benson, Ellis, & Menanteau (2002)10 . Consideration of observational data (note that Mmin scales differently with h0.7 for the different sets of sources)\nbegins to make it possible to discriminate between the models. We find that the volume\ndensities of massive SCUBA galaxies are clearly above the predictions of the Durham model,\n10\n\nSee in particular Figure 1 of astro-ph/0110387.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nand are significantly above the predictions of the Munich model if a reasonable correction for\na finite starburst lifetime is applied. At z \u223c 1, the data are still above the Durham model,\nbut in good agreement with the Munich model. Both the Durham and the Munich models\naccount well for the local volume densities of massive galaxies.\n\n4.3.\n\nComparison to QSOs\n\nJ02399 is a type 2 QSO. It is thus of interest to compare our estimated volume densities\nfor the brightest submillimeter galaxies to those of high-z QSOs. Converting the UV/optical\nand X-ray luminosities of type 1 QSOs to bolometric luminosities with the Elvis et al. (1994)\ncorrection factors and assuming that the central black hole contains about 0.15% of the stellar\nspheroid mass (Ho 1999; Kormendy & Gebhardt 2001), the QSO host mass is related to the\noptical/X-ray luminosity by\n\u0011\n\u0010\nMhost\nf\u03bd L\u03bd\n10\n\u03b7 \u22121\n= 10\nM\u2299\n4.9 \u00d7 1011 L\u2299 Edd\n\n(4)\n\nHere f\u03bd is the bolometric correction for the band luminosity L\u03bd (fX \u223c 30 and fopt \u223c 14:\nElvis et al. 1994), and \u03b7Edd is the radiative efficiency relative to the Eddington rate.11 For\n44 \u22122\n\u22121\n\u03b7Edd \u223c 0.5, host masses \u2265 1011 h\u22122\n0.7 M\u2299 correspond to X-ray luminosities \u2265 3\u00d710 h0.7 erg s\nand absolute B, V , and R magnitudes \u2264 \u221224.7. From the X-ray work of Miyaji, Hasinger,\n& Schmidt (2001) and the optical work of Hawkins & Veron (1996), we then estimate the\ndensity of type 1 AGN with Mhost \u2265 1011 h\u22122\n0.7 M\u2299 in the range 1.5 \u2264 z \u2264 3 to be \u223c\n\u22123\n\u22126\u00b10.5 3\n10\nh0.7 Mpc . The QSO lifetime tQSO may be a factor of three shorter than tstarburst\n(Nusser & Silk 1993), and the ratio of type 2 to type 1 QSOs is \u03c1 \u2265 4 (Gilli, Salvati, &\nHasinger 2001). Correcting for tstarburst /tQSO \u00d7 \u03c1 \u223c 12, the comoving density of massive QSO\nhosts is \u223c 10\u22125\u00b10.5 h30.7 Mpc\u22123 , in remarkably\u2013 and probably fortuitously\u2013 good agreement\nwith the values estimated for the bright SCUBA sources listed above. This agreement is\nconsistent with the general assumption that the evolution of the most massive black holes\nand their host galaxies is connected through common formation at high redshift.\n11\n\nNote that this relationship predicts a stellar spheroid mass for J02399 of \u2265 2.4 \u00d7 1011 h\u22122\n0.7 M\u2299 if 50% of\nits LIR comes from a buried type 2 QSO, \u03b7Edd \u223c 0.5, and fIR \u2265 1.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n4.4.\n\nIs the discrepancy between observed and predicted volume densities\nmass-dependent?\n\nCDM models do very well in accounting for the large-scale structure, luminosity functions, and color distributions of galaxies at z = 0 (e.g., Kauffmann et al. 1999; Cole et al.\n2000; papers in Guiderdoni et al. 2001). They predict the continuous buildup of galaxy\nmasses from small to large through the basic process of hierarchical merging. If our observations indicate that these models underpredict the high-z volume densities of massive\ngalaxies, the next question is whether this shortfall originates in the predicted evolution\nof the underlying \u039bCDM halo distributions, in some general feature of the semi-analytic\nmodels which build on them, or in some specific aspect of how the semi-analytic recipes\ntreat baryonic processes in the most massive systems. Consideration of the halo catalogues\nof Kauffmann et al. (1999) offers no obvious evidence that the parameters of the \u039bCDM\nsimulations per se are at fault. If we multiply each halo mass by \u03a9b (\u03a9M \u2212 \u03a9b )\u22121 to estimate\nthe associated baryonic mass, then even for the lower \u03a9b = 0.02 preferred by the Durham\ngroup, the comoving volume densities of haloes with available baryonic mass \u2265 1011 M\u2299\ncomfortably exceed the volume densities of galaxies with observed baryonic mass \u2265 1011 M\u2299\nat every redshift. This statement remains true even if the point plotted for six SCLS sources\nin the upper panel of Figure 6 gains a full factor of \u223c 11.5 correction for finite starburst\nlifetimes.\nTo evaluate the performance of the semi-analytic models in a lower mass regime, we\ncompare in the lower panel of Figure 6 the model predictions with the comoving volume\ndensities of z \u223c 3 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). These systems have average stellar masses\n\u2217\nnear but somewhat below the knee of the Schechter function (M \u223c 1010 h\u22122\n0.7 M\u2299 \u223c 0.14 m ),\naccording to the recent stellar synthesis analyses of Papovich, Dickinson, & Ferguson (2001)\nand Shapley et al. (2001). Again, we compare these measurements to the Durham and\nMunich model predictions. In this lower mass bin, the semi-analytic models still fall below\n(but now closer to) the observed volume densities of LBGs. In addition, we have plotted\nthe model predictions of Somerville, Primack, & Faber (2001), who include the effects of\nextinction on the predicted volume densities for R < 25.5 LBGs and consider two extreme\nstar formation histories\u2013 one with a constant star formation timescale, and one including star\nformation bursts triggered by galaxy collisions and mergers. Clearly the low star formation\nrates predicted by the constant model fail by a large factor in accounting for the data, while\nthe burst models fit the data very well. The Munich and Durham models (which include\nsome acceleration of the star formation rate at high redshift) lie between these two extremes.\nIt appears that the recipes for star formation and feedback used in the semi-analytic models\ndo reasonably well in accounting for sub-m\u2217 galaxies, once the influence of merger-induced\nbursts is included.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nOur discussion thus suggests that the discrepancy between models and data may increase\nwith galaxy mass. Systems with masses a few times m\u2217 have comoving number densities\nat z \u223c 1 which are comparable to those in the local Universe (z = 0). At z = 2 \u2212 3, the\nsame kinds of objects still have comoving volume densities which are \u2265 10% of their z = 0\nvalues. These findings appear to contradict current hierarchical CDM models, which predict\na large decrease of the abundance of massive galaxies at z \u2265 1 due to an extended phase\nof merger activity (e.g., Kauffmann & Charlot 1998). The data presented here indicate\nthat this picture may have to be revised with respect to the rate at which massive systems\n(and bulges) are assembled at fairly high redshift, possibly through adjustment of \u03a9b and\nits coupling to very efficient star formation in major mergers. More work is needed before\na firmer statement can be made about this crucial, \"baryonic mass assembly\" test of the\ncurrent standard cosmogony. Both observational and theoretical estimates are still very\nuncertain, with the former depending on small samples and large lifetime corrections, and\nthe latter on ad hoc input recipes for star formation and feedback.\nWe thank IRAM staff members, particularly Roberto Neri, for their help in coordinating\nand conducting the observations for this project, and Rob Ivison for sharing information\nabout the SCLS lensing model. We are especially grateful to Len Cowie for providing us\nwith his high-resolution Keck images and astrometry of J02399 prior to publication. We also\nthank Carlton Baugh for providing the most current Durham model predictions, Mark Bautz\nfor clarifying the Chandra astrometry, and Chung-Pei Ma, Chris McKee, and Ian Smail\nfor very useful comments.
