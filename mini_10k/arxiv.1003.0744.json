The Taurid Complex\nappears to be the debris of this erstwhile comet; it includes at least 19 of the brightest\nnear-Earth objects. Sub-kilometre bodies in meteor streams may present the greatest\nregional impact hazard on timescales of human concern.\nKey words: comets: general\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe sudden onset of the Younger Dryas cooling 12,900 years\nago was marked by intense wildfires over North America,\nmajor disruption of human culture, and the rapid extinction of 35 genera of North American mammals (Faith &\nSurovell 2009). A thin carbon-rich black layer of this age has\nbeen identified at many sites across North America (Haynes\n2008), coincident in age with the Younger Dryas boundary.\nRecently, several geochemical markers at this layer have\nbeen presented which seem to indicate that a major extraterrestrial event was involved in these events (Firestone et al.\n2007; Firestone 2009). The markers include:\nNanodiamonds, found in abundance at fifteen Younger\nDryas Boundary (YDB) sites across North America and\nnorth-west Europe, covering a quarter of the Earth's surface.\nThey are mostly found embedded within particles of melted\nplant resins, confined to the thin black layer, none having\nyet been found in other strata dating from 55,000 BC to\nthe present. All three diamond allotropes are present in the\nboundary sediments including lonsdaleite (hexagonal nanodiamonds), which is shock-synthesised and found on Earth\nonly in association with ET impacts or inside meteorites\n(Kennett et al. 2009). The nanodiamonds and lonsdaleite\nfound in meteorites were already present before atmospheric\nentry (Clarke et al. 1981).\nSoot, microspherules and magnetic grains found at high\nconcentrations, the microspherules having trace element\nabundances comparable to lunar KREEP but not to any\nother terrestrial or observed meteoritic source (Firestone\n2009). The only previously known co-occurrence of soot,\nnanodiamonds and rapid extinction is at the CretaceousTertiary boundary layer.\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: napierwm@cardiff.ac.uk(WMN)\n\nTo cause destruction on a continental scale by a single\nimpact, the energy required is \u223c107 Mt, corresponding to a\n4 km wide comet (Toon et al. 1997). Firestone et al. (2007)\nproposed that such a comet broke up on atmospheric entry and struck the 2-km thick Laurentide ice sheet. They\nspeculated that four deep holes in the Great Lakes might\nbe craters produced by this event. This short-term catastrophe was followed by a sudden return to ice age conditions\non Earth which lasted for over a millennium, the cause of\nwhich is a matter for speculation (loc. cit.; Franz\u00e9n & Cropp\n2007). An alternative proposal to explain the data is that the\nEarth encountered a rare swarm of carbonaceous chondrites\nor comets, yielding multiple airbursts and possible surface\nimpacts (Kennett, Kennett, West et al. 2009).\nThe nature of the event at the Younger Dryas Boundary remains controversial. For example it has been argued\nthat the mammoths were in decline for about a millennium\nbefore the final extinctions (Gill, Williams, Jackson et al.\n2009). Nevertheless it seems difficult to account for the geophysical markers \u2013 nanodiamonds, exotic sediment composition, evidence of a sudden, continent-wide fiery catastrophe\netc \u2013 without the occurrence of some extraordinary extraterrestrial event.\nProblems have however been raised from the astronomical perspective. It is difficult to reconcile a major astronomical catastrophe of continental dimensions as recently\nas 12.9 ka ago with the known population of near-Earth objects (NEOs) currently being revealed by comet and asteroid search programmes such as the LINEAR and Catalina\nsurveys. Thus it has been estimated that a 10 megaton impact may occur anywhere on Earth with a mean recurrence\ntime 2000\u20133000 years (Stuart & Binzel 2004). An impact of\nenergy 1000 Mt or more is expected with recurrence time\n\u223c60,000 yr (loc. cit. and Morbidelli, Jedicke, Bottke et al.\n2002). While this would be immensely damaging, the ef-\n\n\f2\n\nW.M. Napier\n\nfect would be regional rather than continental or global. On\nconventional reckoning, the impact of a 4 km asteroid as\nrecently as 13,000 years ago is a one in a thousand event,\nand if an active comet, the probability is a few in a million\n(Harris 2008). It has also been pointed out that, to ignite\nfires in southern Arizona by thermal radiation from a fireball over the Great Lakes, the projectile would have had to\nbe 100 km across, and all non-microbial life on Earth would\nhave been wiped out (Melosh 2009). The geophysical evidence for an astronomical catastrophe at this boundary has\nbeen extended to Venezuela (Mahaney et al. 2010), which\nexacerbates that difficulty.\nHowever, a potential deficiency of impact assessments\nbased on current Spaceguard data is that they assume statistical completeness. To estimate impact risks at say the\n\u223c10\u22124 per annum level by extrapolating from \u223c10 yr of\nSpaceguard surveys is analogous to forecasting three years'\nweather by extrapolating one day's observation. A cascade of\ncomet disintegration, for example, could be a significant hazard on such timescales (cf the 1994 impacts on Jupiter following the disintegration of D/1993 F2 Shoemaker-Levy 9).\nIt has also been objected that, if the Younger Dryas\nevent was due to an encounter with a swarm of debris 13,000\nyears ago, the material would still be visible in the inner solar system at the present time. Meteoroid data, being largely\ntracers of comet disintegration, do indeed have the potential to look into the history of the cometary environment for\ntens of thousands of years, and in this paper we discuss such\nevidence. We first, in Section 2, summarise evidence which\nindicates that a large, short-period comet entered the inner\nplanetary system a few 104 yr ago and has since then been\nundergoing a hierarchy of disintegrations, yielding the Taurid Complex. We show that at least 19 of the largest NEOs\nhave orbits significantly close to that of Comet Encke. In\nSection 3 we numerically model the disintegration history\nof the progenitor comet. This reveals that encounters with\ndense swarms of material, sufficient to produce a 12.9 ka\ncosmic event, are indeed reasonable expectations of recent\nEarth history. Section 4 gives a broadbrush description of\nthe likely consequences of an encounter with such a swarm.\nThere is satisfactory agreement with the main physical features at this boundary.\nThe occurrence of a major celestial catastrophe over\ncontinental dimensions as recently as 12900 years ago, which\nis quite unexpected from Spaceguard data alone, may carry\nimplications for assessments of the impact hazard currently\nfaced by civilization (cf Napier & Asher 2009).\n\n2\n2.1\n\nA LARGE PALAEOLITHIC SHORT-PERIOD\nCOMET\nThe zodiacal cloud and the Taurid meteors\n\nThe complex nature of the Arietid-Taurid meteor streams\nhas long been recognized, with for example Denning (1928)\nidentifying 13 separate sub-streams within the system. The\nComplex encompasses comet 2P/Encke with orbital period\n3.3 yr. Differential orbital precession arising from Jovian\nperturbations yields two main night-time branches, and two\ndaytime branches. From the orbital dispersion of the material, Steel & Asher (1996) derive an age 20\u201330 kyr for the\nsystem (cf Babadzhanov et al. 1990).\n\nThis broad complex, which comprises at least half the\nmass of the zodiacal cloud, appears not to be in equilibrium\nand to be replenished sporadically (Napier 2001). Observations of both visual (Stohl 1986) and radar 'sporadic' meteors (Campbell-Brown 2008) indicate that they are not in\nfact sporadic but are rather concentrated in a small number\nof primary sources, two of which \u2013 the helion and and antihelion sources \u2013 appear to derive from Comet 2P/Encke or its\nparent. Wiegert, Vaubaillon & Campbell-Brown (2009a,b),\nmodelling this sporadic meteor complex, find that this comet\ndominates the helion and antihelion sources by a factor of\nabout ten. They consider that the sporadic population is\ndominated by a small number of comets (especially Encke\nand 55P/Tempel-Tuttle) with high-transfer efficiencies to\nEarth, rather than the comet population as a whole. The\ncurrent Comet Encke is, however, inadequate to supply the\nzodiacal cloud, and it is probably just a recently reactivated\nfragment of the progenitor.\nThe Taurid Complex has also been detected in situ\nthrough the Long Duration Exposure Facility, in the meteoroid mass range 10\u221210 to 10\u22124 gm, on four large-area faces\nover a period of 5.8 years (McBride et al. 1995). These workers found that the Taurid Complex is a major part of the\ncurrent zodiacal cloud, yielding a significant proportion \u2013 say\na third \u2013 of the sporadic meteoroid influx. Zook (2001) found\nthat asteroidal grains probably do not contribute more than\n25% of the meteoroid cratering population on LDEF, comet\ndust being the rest. These results appear to strengthen the\nearlier conclusions of Whipple (1967) and others that the\nTaurid meteors are the remnants of an erstwhile exceptional\nbody in a short-period, Earth-crossing orbit.\nThey are also consistent with the empirical finding that\nthe current zodiacal cloud is overmassive by one or two powers of 10 in relation to current replenishing sources (Whipple\n1967; Clube & Napier 1984; Hughes 1996; Napier 2001). The\nmass of the zodiacal cloud is estimated to be \u223c2-30\u00d71019 gm\n(Hughes 1996). If say half of this is due to a single progenitor\ncomet, and (conservatively) half its input has disappeared\ndue to Poynting-Robertson and collisional effects, then for\nprogenitor comet density 0.5 gm cm\u22123 , this yields an original\nprogenitor comet 50 \u2013 100 km in diameter, neglecting the\ncontribution from larger bodies within the Complex (Napier\n2009).\n2.2\n\nNear-Earth objects associated with Comet\nEncke\n\nComet evolution commonly proceeds via fragmentation into\nsmaller bodies, and indeed this may be the prime disintegration route (Jenniskens 2008; Levasseur-Regourd, Hadamcik, Desvoivres et al. 2009). The disintegration of D/1993\nF2 Shoemaker-Levy 9 was followed by the impact of \u223c20\nfragments on to Jupiter, with impact energies \u223c105 Mt.\nIn late 1995, Comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 split\ninto three fragments, having been seen as a single object\non its previous return in 1990. On subsequent returns fresh\nmini-comets were seen, and by 2006 over 150 fragments had\nbeen detected (Reach, Vaubaillon, Kelley et al. 2009; Ishiguro, Usui, Sarugaku et al. 2009). At least one fragment was\n\u223c300 m across and a dozen or so were in the size range of the\nTunguska impactor. Comet C/1996 B2 Hyakutake split into\nseven sub-nuclei whose sizes seem to have been in the range\n\n\fUpper Palaeolithic extinctions and the Taurid Complex\n\nfragments are known of a total probably running to thousands, and it appears that disintegration proceeds through\na cascade of fragmentations (Sekanina & Chodas 2004), the\nfragments themselves continuing to break up.\n\n90\n\n180\n\nCometary breakup may also involve the creation of dormant bodies (Kresak & Kresakova, 1987; Jenniskens loc. cit.,\nPorubc\u0306an, Kornos\u0306 & Williams 2004; Babadzhanov, Williams\n& Kokhirova 2008a). This seems to have happened, for example, in the case of the Quadrantids (Jenniskens 2004;\nBabadzhanov et al. 2004), and Comet Biela (Jennisken &\nVaubaillon 2007), while fireball outbursts from the \u03ba Cygnid shower support the hypothesis that the formation of the\nstream and dormant bodies within it proceeded from a cascade of disruptions of the progenitor comet (Trigo-Rodriguez\net al. 2009).\n\n0\n\n270\n\nFigure 1.

There appears to be more than one\nmode of disintegration, breakup at perihelion presumably\ndue to tidal stresses being one, and 'unknown' being the\nothers. In the case of the Kreutz sungrazers, several hundred\n\nThe presence of substreams in the Taurid Complex indicates that the progenitor comet also took the route of multiple disintegration, and searches have revealed a number\nof NEOs associated with the sub-streams of the complex.\n(Clube & Napier 1984, 1990; Asher, Clube & Steel 1993;\nBabadzhanov, Williams & Kokhirova 2008b, Porubc\u0306an, Kornos\u0306 & Williams 2006). Clube & Napier (1984) pointed to\norbital resemblances between Comet Encke, Oljato, 1982\nTA and 1984 KB \u2013 later numbered and named 6063 Jason\n\u2013 and proposed that these bodies, along with the Taurid\nmeteors, were the remnants of an erstwhile giant comet.\nThese are amongst the largest NEOs. The database has expanded enormously since then, and can be further examined\nto see whether the hypothesis continues to hold up. The\ndata chosen for this purpose were the NEAs listed in the\nMinor Planet Center to 2nd April 2008, comprising 2250\nAmor (Mars-crossing) asteroids and 2622 Apollos (Earthcrossing).\nFig. 1 shows the result of extracting the 19 brightest\nnear-Earth asteroids (H < 16.5) in the range 1.83\u2264 a \u2264\n2.7 AU, 0.63\u2264 e \u2264 1.0 and 0\u25e6 \u2264 i \u2264 14\u25e6 broadly encompassing the elements of Comet Encke, but with no restriction\non the longitude of perihelion \u031f, which is \u223c161\u25e6 for the\ncomet. In the absence of a generic relation between these\nNEAs, their \u031f-distribution is expected to be random, with\nthe longitudes of perihelion precessing at somewhat different rates. However it can be seen that this is not so, the\naverage value of \u031f being \u223c179\u00b114\u25e6 , i.e. 13\u25e6 from Comet\nEncke, as against an expectation of \u223c90\u25e6 for a random distribution (Fig. 2). All but one of these NEOs lie in the\n120\u25e6 range 133\u2264 \u031f \u2264 251\u25e6 encompassing Comet Encke.\nThe significance of this result was tested by running trials\nin which the longitude of perihelion of 19 objects was randomly distributed, and their mean departure from 161\u25e6 was\ntested. The outcome of 50,000 such simulations is illustrated\nin Fig. 2. Clearly, the configuration shown in Fig. 1 has negligible probability of being due to chance.\nFive of the 19 NEAs in Table 1 are tightly bunched\naround the current \u031f = 237\u25e6 of 2212 Hephaistos, their mean\nlongitude being 238\u00b17.6\u25e6 . They appear to form a separate\ngroup (Clube & Napier 1984; Steel & Asher 1994). If these\nand Hephaistos are excluded, the remaining NEAs have\n< \u031f >= 140.8\u00b110.1\u25e6 as against say \u223c150.5\u25e6 for the 15 Taurid substreams identified by Porub\u010dan, Korno\u0161 & Williams\n(2006), or 136.2\u25e6 for the 10 Taurid Complex asteroids which\nthey identified.

While there is spectral diversity amongst the nuclei of comets (Luu 1993), not enough\nis known about the spectral characteristics of comet nuclei\nto permit a confident diagnosis about the provenance of any\nparticular small body. Nearly all the NEAs in Table 1 have\nperihelia <1 AU, and thermal histories quite different from\nthose of most comets. Sublimation of volatiles at high temperatures from the surface layers may leave behind mantles\nof rubble relatively depleted in dark organics. A possible\nexample of this is the 5 km object Phaethon, which has\nthe reflectance spectrum of a main belt asteroid, but whose\nassociated Geminid meteors give them an unambiguously\ncometary origin (Kasuga 2009; Borovi\u00e7ka 2007). Ten of the\nTaurid Complex asteroids listed in Table 1 also appear in a\ngroup of 17 NEAs obtained by Babadzhanov (2001) using\nthe reduced D-criterion of Asher et al. (1993), when orbital\nsimilarity was tested against that of 2P/Encke. The list of\nBabadzhanov (2001) was not restricted by magnitude. All\nthe NEAs in his list had meteor showers associated with\nthem, supporting a cometary origin for these bodies.\nThe alignment shown in Fig. 1 is rapidly lost as one\nmoves to fainter magnitudes. This might imply that, at the\nsub-kilometre level, there is a dearth of bodies produced\nby the disintegration of the progenitor comet, or that its\nsignal is lost in the noise of asteroids from the main belt.\nDetection of such bodies is likely to be difficult, although\nPorubc\u0306an et al. (2006) and Babadzhanov et al.

A 1,000-particle meteoroid trail viewed from an ecliptic pole. The trail was generated by fragmentating a comet in\nan Encke-like orbit at perihelion, the fragments being ejected in\nrandom directions at speeds up to 20 m s\u22121 . The Earth would\ntraverse this trail in at most a few hours.\n\nas 15 substreams, within the Taurid meteor complex and\nassociated with observable meteor showers and fireballs.\nIn the course of its disintegration, one expects the original comet to have given rise to concentrations of material\nalong its orbital track. This disintegration may be continuing to the present day, but given the evidence that the\noriginal comet was exceptionally massive, there may have\nbeen epochs of strongly enhanced fireball and Tunguska-like\nactivity during its most active phase. Swarms of particles\ntrapped in resonant orbits would extend the lifetime of some\nof these concentrations, as predicted by Asher and Clube\n(1993) and observed by Dubietis & Arlt (2007). Porubc\u0306an\net al. (2006) found that two of the filaments originated 4000\n\u2013 5000 years ago, while one originated over 5000 years ago.\nThe Complex is likely to be much older than this, perhaps\n0.2-0.3 Myr (Steel & Asher 1996). This great age, deduced\nfrom the dispersion of the material, is consistent with its exceptional mass. Since the putative 12,900 BP event of North\nAmerica fits comfortably within the timescale of evolution\nof the progenitor comet, we may reasonably ask whether one\ncan construct a comet disintegration model to account for\nthe event.\n\n3\n\nEVOLUTION OF A LARGE\nDISINTEGRATING COMET\n\nGenerally, the separation speeds of cometary fragments are\nup to \u223c5 m s\u22121 (Kres\u00e1k 1993). However the escape velocity from the surface of a 100 km comet is \u223c15 m s\u22121 . As\nthe bodies cascade down through smaller sizes, disruption\nspeeds will presumably decline. Here we consider the case\nwhere a comet fragment in an Encke-like orbit disrupts at\nperihelion. The initial orbit is given an inclination of 6\u25e6 . The\nfragments are assumed to move away in random directions\nfrom the comet.\nFigure 3 shows the projection, looking from an ecliptic pole, of 1,000 particles ejected at perihelion with random speeds up to Vm = 20 m s\u22121 , during their first passage\nthrough a heliocentric sphere of radius 1 AU. Depending on\n\n\fUpper Palaeolithic extinctions and the Taurid Complex\nthe encounter geometry, the Earth traverses this trail in at\nmost a few hours. For comparison Kres\u00e1k (1993) found that\nthe duration of rare, intense meteor storms is about an hour.\nThe cross-sectional area of this trail is \u223c2000 times that of\nthe Earth, but its length increases linearly with time.\nThe \u00d6pik encounter formula (\u00d6pik 1976) leads to an\nexpectation that, for a single object in an orbit like that of\nComet Encke, the mean interval between collisions with the\nEarth is \u223c2\u00d7108 yr. For an encounter with a single meteoroid trail with 104 times the area of the Earth, the interval\nbetween such encounters becomes \u223c2\u00d7104 yr, comparable\nwith the 20-30 kyr fragmentation history of the Taurid Complex progenitor. Thus if at any given time \u2013 during its major\ndisintegration history \u2013 such a trail is likely to be present,\none or more such encounters is a reasonable expectation. If\nthe meteoroid trail comes from the perihelion disintegration\nof say a 5 \u00d7 1017 gm fragment of the original comet, then\nthe Earth would encounter say 1-5\u00d71014 gm of this material, energetically equivalent to the impact of 2,000-10,000\nTunguska objects over about an hour.\nThe fragments from a disrupting comet tend to have\nsize distributions \u221d d\u2212q with index q not very different from\nthose expected from self-similar cascades (q = 3.5), implying that the mass tends to be concentrated in a few largest\nbodies (e.g. Ishiguro et al. 2009). The probability of a damaging encounter was investigated by adopting a self-similar\nfragmentation model, in which half the mass of a disintegrating fragment was assumed to be lost as dust, and the\nmass of the largest sub-fragment was taken as 0.3 times the\ninitial mass. This yielded five sub-fragments, each of which\ndisintegrated in self similar manner. Assume that the limiting mass for a meteoroid trail \u2013 generated at perihelion and\nintercepted at Earth \u2013 to cause a damaging bombardment is\nmc = 1017 gm. Each cometary fragment poses a hazard until it disintegrates into sub-fragments and so on, hence the\ntotality of trails created during a cascading disintegration\nmust be computed. With this model we find that a comet\nwhose initial mass is \u223c1020 gm will, in the course of its disintegration, yield \u223c1,000 trails of mass at least 1017 gm. Then\nby the above argument, if the active lifetime of the comet\nis say 20,000 years, the swarm must remain as a coherent\nentity for \u223c20 yr for an expectation of one such encounter.\nThis lifetime requirement is modest, the more so since\nthe orbital period of the Taurid complex bodies (\u223c3.3 yr) is\nclose to a 7:2 mean motion resonance with Jupiter (3.39 yr),\nwhich has a shepherding effect, restricting the spread of\ndense swarms of meteoroids generated by disintegrations\nand so prolonging their lifetimes well beyond 20 yr (Asher\n& Clube 1993; Beech, Hargrove & Brown 2004; Dubietis &\nArlt 2007). From a study of historical meteor storms, and\ncomparison with the cometary dust trails detected by IRAS,\nKres\u00e1k (1993) found that the survival times of the trails are\ntypically \u223c60 yr.\nThese considerations suggest that, in the course of disintegration of the comet Encke progenitor over 20-30 kyr,\none or more damaging encounters with the debris from a\nrecent fragmentation is a reasonably probable event.\n\n5\n\nTable 2.

To match the observations at the\nBoundary, the swarm model must be able to reproduce the\nobservations of extensive conflagration on at least a continental scale, predict the high concentration of nanodiamonds, and account for the presence of apparently lunar\nmaterial in the boundary layer.\n4.1\n\nThermal effects\n\nWood subjected to a flux of radiant energy\n\u223c4\u00d7107 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 will ignite within 1\u201320 seconds.\nWhile the whole-Earth encounter may take hours, the\nenergy within any local horizon may be released overhead\nwithin a few seconds. Wildfires will thus be initiated over a\nland area say 5% of the area of the Earth (that of North\nAmerica, for example) if the meteoroid swarm deposits \u223c1\n- 20\u00d71025 ergs during the encounter. At the extreme, we\ncan assume an encounter speed v=30 km s\u22121 and 100%\nefficiency of conversion of kinetic to radiant energy in the\nupper atmosphere. Then the required mass of swarm to\nyield a continent-wide conflagration is \u223c2 - 40\u00d71012 gm.\nIf the radiant energy is an order of magnitude down on\nthis (say with the most of the energy going into bulk\nmotion of air before disintegration, slowing the bolides to\nsay 10 km s\u22121 ), then one requires the Earth to intercept\na mass \u223c2 - 40\u00d71013 gm which is in the range of the\nmasses discussed in Section 3. In reality, this energy will\nbe distributed over a large number of discrete areas corresponding to Tunguska-like fireballs. There is therefore an\nexpectation of conflagration over at least continental scales\nfollowing such an encounter. A similar figure is reached\nif one distributes say N epicentres each of 2\u00d7103 km2\nof fire damage over 25\u00d7106 km2 of continent: then one\nrequires N \u223c104 Tunguska-like impacts corresponding to\nan intercepted mass \u223c5\u00d71014 gm.\n4.2\n\nNanodiamonds\n\nThe Tagish Lake meteorite fell over Yukon Territory in\nBritish Columbia on 18th January 2000. The fragments are\nextremely fragile, low-density objects with a unique lithology, bearing some resemblance to the most primitive carbonaceous chondrites types, the CI and CM chondrites;\nthe meteorite is nevertheless quite distinct from either of\nthem. It contains unprocessed pre-solar grains and the highest abundance of nanodiamonds of any meteorite, \u223c36504330 ppm (Grady, Verchovsky, Franchi et al. 2002). The\n\n\f6\n\nW.M. Napier\n\npre-entry orbital elements of the body are shown in Table 2,\nalong with those of asteroid Cuno and Comet Encke. The\nTagish Lake fall has been identified with the \u03bc-Orionid fireball stream which, in turn, has been associated with (4183)\nCuno (Terentjeva & Barabanov 2004), an asteroid belonging to the group of large NEOs which appear to be part\nof the Taurid Complex (Table 1). These generic relationships, along with the primitive nature of the Tagish Lake\nmeteorite, suggest that it may be part of this Complex and\nthat nanodiamonds are generally present in the progenitor\ncomet.\nThe concentration of nanodiamonds in the 12.9 ka sediments at multiple locations across North America ranges\nfrom \u223c0.01 to 3.7 ppm by weight (Kennett et al. 2009). Let\nthe incoming cosmic material have fractional nanodiamond\nabundance f , falling on an area A of the Earth, and spread\nthrough a depth h of the Younger Dryas Boundary. Then to\nyield a concentration c throughout the boundary, the mass\nof swarm material intercepted by the Earth is\nM = Ah\u03c1c/f\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the bulk density of the material wherein the nanodiamonds are found. If the bulk of the swarm material falls\non say 5% of the Earth's surface (A = 2.5 \u00d7 1017 cm2 ), then\nadopting f = 4 \u00d7 10\u22123 by weight from Grady et al. (2002),\nc = 10\u22126 from Kennett et al. (2009), and assuming the nanodiamonds are concentrated in a layer of thickness h = 2 cm\nand bulk density \u03c1 = 2.5 gm cm\u22123 , one finds that intercepting a mass of 6 \u00d7 1014 gm can account for the observed\nnanodiamond concentration at 12.9 ka. This should probably be increased by a factor of two or so because volatiles\nin the cometary material would disperse in the atmosphere,\nbut it is still a modest requirement in the context of the\nbreakup model. There is therefore no necessity for the nanodiamonds to be formed in impacts, although of course this\nis by no means excluded.\n4.3\n\nLunar debris\n\nThe Earth-Moon distance is \u223c60 Earth radii, comparable\nwith the width of the meteoroid filaments being considered\nhere (Fig. 3); thus any swarm which strikes the Earth may\nalso strike the Moon, the bulk of this impacting mass being in the few largest objects. The mass of lunar material\n11\nthrown into space by impactors say >\n\u223c 10 gm is uncertain\nbut probably comparable to the mass of impacting material\n(Chyba, Owen & Ip 1994), and a proportion of this escaped\nmaterial will strike the Earth. The dynamical evolution of\nlunar ejecta has been followed by Gladman, Burns, Duncan\net al. (1995). The delivery efficiency p depends strongly on\nthe location of impact, but characteristically p \u223c0.05\u20130.2 of\nthe lunar material ejected will impact the Earth, the bulk of\nit within a few years of impact. Thus, if say the mass of the\nmeteoroid swarm material striking the Earth is ME , then\nbecause of its smaller target area, the Moon will intercept\n0.05ME of swarm material, resulting in the ejection to space\nof a similar mass of lunar material and the fall of 0.05pME\nof Moon dust on to the Earth. With p = 0.1, one expects an\nadmixture of lunar material at the wildfire horizon amounting to \u223c1% that of swarm material, to order of magnitude.\nThis seems to be in the ballpark of the KREEP-like material\ndiscussed by Firestone (2009).\n\n5\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe proposition that an exceptionally large comet has been\nundergoing disintegration in the inner planetary system goes\nback over 40 years (Whipple 1967), and the evidence for\nthe hypothesis has accumulated to the point where it now\nseems compelling. Radio and visual meteor data show that\nthe zodiacal cloud is dominated by a broad stream of largely\ncometary material which incorporates an ancient, dispersed\nsystem of related meteor streams. Embedded within this system are significant numbers of large NEOs, including Comet\nEncke. Replenishment of the zodiacal cloud is sporadic, with\nthe current cloud being substantially overmassive in relation\nto current sources. The system is most easily understood as\ndue to the injection and continuing disintegration of a comet\n50\u2013100 km in diameter. The fragmentation of comets is now\nrecognized as a major route of their disintegration, and this\nis consistent with the numerous sub-streams and comoving\nasteroids observed within the Taurid Complex. The probable\nepoch of injection of this large comet, \u223c20\u201330 kyr ago, comfortably straddles the 12.9 kyr date of the Younger Dryas\nBoundary.\nThe hypothesis that terrestrial catastrophes may happen on timescales \u223c0.1\u20131 Myr, due to the Earth running\nthrough swarms of debris from disintegrating large comets,\nis likewise not new (Clube & Napier 1984). However the\naccumulation of observations has allowed us to build an astronomical model, closely based on the contemporary environment, which can plausibly yield the postulated YDB\ncatastrophe. The interception of \u223c1015 gm of material during the course of the disintegration is shown here to have\nbeen a reasonably probable event, capable of yielding destruction on a continental scale.\nThe object of this paper is not to claim that such an encounter took place at 12,900 BP \u2013 that is a matter for Earth\nscientists \u2013 but to show that a convincing astronomical scenario can be constructed which seems to give a satisfactory match to the major geophysical features of the Younger\nDryas Boundary data.\nIf indeed the YDB event was an astronomical catastrophe, its occurrence bears little relation to current impact\nhazard assessments derived from NEO surveys.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nI thank Iwan Williams and David Asher for suggestions\nwhich materially improved the original version of the paper.\n\nREFERENCES\nAsher D.J., Clube S.V.M., 1993, QJRAS, 34, 481\nAsher D.J., Clube S.V.M., Steel, D.I., 1993, MNRAS, 264, 93\nAsher D.
