CPS plays\na crucial role in understanding a large class of weakly\ninteracting nonlinear dynamical systems and has been\ndemonstrated both theoretically and experimentally in a\nwide variety of natural systems [3\u201312]. Despite our substantial understanding of the phenomenon of CPS and its\npotential applications in low-dimensional systems, only a\nvery few studies on it have been reported in time-delayed\nsystems, which are essentially infinite-dimensional in nature [13, 14]. Due to the highly non-phase-coherent\nchaotic/hyperchaotic attractors with complex topological properties exhibited by these systems in general, it is\noften impossible to estimate the phase explicitly and to\nidentify CPS.\nRecently, we have introduced a nonlinear transformation to recast the original non-phase-coherent attractors\ninto smeared limit-cycle attractors to enable to estimate\nthe phase explicitly and to identify CPS in time-delay\nmodel systems for the first time in the literature [13]. In\nthis paper, we report the first experimental demonstration of CPS in coupled time-delay systems using electronic circuits. We have also experimentally implemented\nthe methodology of localized sets [15] and show that this\nis a crucial and a general framework for characterizing\nCPS even in non-phase-coherent attractors of time-delay\nsystems [13, 14]. Our results will open up the possibility of experimental realization of CPS in other physical\nsystems with delay and to their potential applications.\nIn particular, we will demonstrate the existence of CPS\nin unidirectionally coupled time-delay electronic circuits\nwith threshold nonlinearity in both chaotic and hyperchaotic regimes experimentally (Note that bidirectional\ncoupling can also work equally well). In addition to the\nsnapshots of time series of both systems as seen from\nthe oscilloscope, we have used the framework of localized\nsets [15] to characterize the existence of CPS in the above\n\n+ A\n-\n\nR1\n\nRf/R(U1-U2)\n\nU1(t)\n\nR2\n\nND1\n\nU2(t)\n\nND2\nC1\n\nC2\n\nU2(t - T2d)\n\nU1(t - T1d)\nDELAY\n\nDELAY\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic diagram of the unidirectionally coupled\ntime-delay analog circuits with threshold nonlinearity.

To investigate localized sets, we have considered the 'event' as\nmaxima of the flow of the drive system and recorded the\nresponse system to obtain the 'sets', whenever a maximum occurs in the drive system and vice versa. The\nsets are then superimposed on the drive (response) attractor, which get localized on it during CPS but spread\nover the entire attractor when the systems evolve independently. Further, we have also confirmed the existence\nof CPS numerically using the localized sets, the largest\nLyapunov exponents of the coupled time-delay systems\nand also with another independent approach based on recurrence analysis, namely the correlation of probability\nof recurrence (CCP R ) [16].\nThe coupled electronic circuit investigated here is\nshown in Fig. 1 as a block diagram.

The four largest Lyapunov\nexponents of (1) are depicted in Fig. 7(a) as a function\nof \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1). (1) The zero Lyapunov exponent of the\nresponse system already becomes negative for lower values of \u03b5 and the positive Lyapunov exponents become\ngradually negative for \u03b5 > 0.62 indicating the existence\nof CPS. This is a strong indication of some degree of\ncorrelation in the amplitudes, as transition of positive\nLyapunov exponents to negative values correspond to\nthe stabilization of transverse instabilities of the response\nattractor, of both the systems even before the onset of\nCPS and such a negative transition of positive Lyapunov\nexponents at the onset of CPS is a typical characteristic of time-delay systems [13]. Similar transitions have\nalso been reported in non-phase-coherent attractors of\nlow-dimensional systems [1, 2, 13]. (2) The definition of\nCCP R = hP \u03041 (t)P \u03042 (t)i/\u03c31 \u03c32 , where P\u03041,2 means that the\nmean value has been subtracted and \u03c31,2 are the standard deviations of P1 (t) and P2 (t) respectively, h*i is the\ntime average and P (t) is a generalized autocorrelation\nfunction based on recurrence properties [16]. If both the\nsystems are in CPS, the probability of recurrence is maximal at the same time t and CCP R \u2248 1. If they are not in\nCPS, the maxima do not occur simultaneously and hence\none can expect a drift in both the probability of recurrences resulting in low values of CCP R . The low values of\nCCP R [Fig. 7(b)] in the range \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 0.62) indicates that\nboth coupled systems are not in CPS and for \u03b5 > 0.62\nthe values of CCP R \u2248 1 confirming the existence of high\nquality CPS.\nIt is important to note that real time estimation of either of these measures is practically not possible. This is\nbecause of experimental data acquisition with high precision, as a function of all system parameters, impose\nsevere limitations on handling huge data set, sampling\nintervals, effect of noise, etc., and even then one has to\nrely on data analysis tools for the estimation of both\nLyapunov exponents and CCP R , which are essentially numerical analysis. Therefore, for the present study, further\ncharacterizations of CPS using Lyapunov exponents and\nCCP R are suitably supplemented by numerical simulations.\nNow, we demonstrate the existence of CPS in a hyperchaotic regime for the delay time \u03c4 = 6.0. For rather\nsamll \u03b5, the sets spread over the entire hyperchaotic attractors of the drive and the response systems. The experimental results are shown in Figs. 5(a)ii and 5(b)ii and\nnumerical results are given in Figs. 6(a)ii and 6(b)ii, respectively, for \u03b5 = 0.3, which confirm that both systems\nevolve independently. On the other hand, for \u03b5 = 0.9,\nthe observed sets that are localized on the hyperchaotic\nattractors of the drive and the response systems as shown\nexperimentally in Figs. 5(c)ii and 5(d)ii and numerically\nin Figs. 6(c)ii and 6(d)ii, respectively, indeed confirm the\nexistence of CPS in the hyperchaotic regime.\n\n\f4\n0.1\n\u03bbmax\n\n0.05\n0\n\n-0.05\n\n(a)\n\n-0.1\n\nCCPR\n\n0\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\n\u03b5\n\n\u03c4\n\nFIG. 8: Confirmation of CPS in the hyperchaotic regime using\n(a)Ten largest Lyapunov exponents, and (b) Correlation of\nprobability of recurrence (CCP R ).\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n\u03b5\n\nFIG. 9: (color online) CPS regime in the parameter space\n(\u03b5, \u03c4 ) characterized using the values of the index CCP R .\n\nThe largest ten Lyapunov exponents of the coupled\ntime-delay systems for the delay time \u03c4 = 6.0 are shown\nin Fig. 8(a) in the range of \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1).

The three least\npositive Lyapunov exponents of the response system become gradually negative for \u03b5 > 0.4 and the largest positive Lyapunov exponent becomes negative for \u03b5 > 0.5, at\nwhich CCP R [Fig. 8(b)] also reaches the value of unity,\nindicating the existence of high quality CPS in the hyperchaotic regime. Further, we have scanned the (\u03b5, \u03c4 )\nparameter space by calculating the value of CCP R to demarcate the regimes of CPS as depicted in Fig. 9. As\ndiscussed above, the coupled systems are in CPS when\nthe value of CCP R \u2248 1 and it is evident from this figure\nthat CPS occurs in a wide range of \u03c4 .\nTo summarize, we have demonstrated the notion of\nCPS in a unidirectionally coupled time-delay electronic\ncircuit with threshold nonlinearity in both chaotic and\nhyperchaotic regimes. The existence of CPS is observed experimentally from snapshots of the time evolution of both the coupled systems and is confirmed with\nthe framework of localized sets. Further we have corroborated the synchronization transition numerically using the phase differences, the concept of localized sets,\nchanges in the largest Lyapunov exponents and from\nthe values of CCP R of the coupled time-delay systems,\nwhich agree well with the experimental observations.\nWe strongly believe that our results especially with the\nframework of localized sets will lead to the identification\nof CPS in other physical systems with delay and to their\npotential applications.\nD.
