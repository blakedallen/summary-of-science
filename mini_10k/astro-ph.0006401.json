INTRODUCTION\n\nf (z, \u03b8) = f (\u03b8)f (z|\u03b8).\nRecent observations of the angular power spectrum\nof the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) [1\u20139] have created much excitement. This data\nmay be used to estimate cosmological parameters. The\nmaximum in the angular power spectrum around the\nmultipole value l \u2248 200 is consistent with inflation and a\nflat universe [1,10]. However the apparent absence of a\npeak at l \u2248 400 \u2212 500 [1] may imply that we have underestimated the size of such cosmological parameters as the\namount of normal baryonic matter or cold dark matter.\nThis data, coupled with recent supernovae observations\n[11], seems to be leading us to seriously consider the existence of a cosmological constant. Future observations\nwill provide valuable cosmological information [12,13].\nThe extraction of cosmological parameters from the\nCMB anisotropy data is a complicated and computer intensive activity. This is especially true as the number of\ncosmological parameters increases as the modal complexities grow. Current analysis exercises have included up to\nten parameters; the scaler quadrupole and gravity wave\nperturbation normalizations (As and At ), the scaler and\ntensor power-law indices for primordial perturbations (ns\nand nt ), the reionization optical depth \u03c4 , the spatial curvature \u03a9k , the energy densities for baryonic matter (\u03a9b ),\ncold dark matter (\u03a9cdm ), neutrinos (\u03a9\u03bd ) and the vacuum\n(\u03a9\u039b ) [14]. Other logical cosmological parameters could\ninclude the Hubble constant, number of neutrino families\nand their masses, etc.\nParameter estimation can be comprehensively described within the language of Bayesian statistics. Application of Bayes' theorem is well suited to astrophysical\nobservations [15]. In Bayesian data analysis the model\nconsists of a joint distribution over all unobserved (pa-\n\nThe prior PDF contains all the information about the\nunobservables that is known from substantive knowledge\nand expert opinion before observing the data. All the\ninformation about the \u03b8 that stems from the experiment\nis contained in the likelihood. In the light of the data,\nthe Bayesian paradigm then updates the prior knowledge\nabout \u03b8, f (\u03b8), to the posterior PDF of \u03b8, f (\u03b8|z). This is\ndone via an application of Bayes theorem through conditioning on the observations\nf (\u03b8|z) =\n\nf (\u03b8, z)\n\u221d f (\u03b8)f (z|\u03b8)\nm(z)\n\nR\nwhere m(z) = f (z|\u03b8)f (\u03b8)d\u03b8 is the marginal PDF of z\nwhich can be regarded as a normalizing constant as it is\nindependent of \u03b8. The Bayesian approach is based on the\nlikelihood function but treats the parameters as random\nvariables and assumes a joint prior distribution that summarizes the available information about the parameters\nbefore observing the data. In the light of the observations, the information about the unknown parameters is\nthen updated via Bayes theorem to the posterior distribution which is proportional to the product of likelihood\nand prior density [16].\nThe problem of marginalization of parameters has been\nthe Achilles heel of Bayesian approaches to parameter\nestimation. The inevitable difficulty in calculating the\nmultidimensional integrals necessary for the determination of posterior probability distributions has hindered\nefforts. However, these impediments have been overcome\nby the progress made within the last decade in Bayesian\ncomputational technology via Markov chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) methods [17]. Since its initial application in\n1\n\n\fdigital signal analysis [18] MCMC methods have revolutionized many areas of applied statistics and should have\nan impact for cosmological parameter estimation from\nCMB measurements.\nIn this paper we do NOT implement a MCMC method\nfor estimating cosmological parameters. This task is best\nleft to the active scientists in the field. Instead we describe how researchers may adapt their existing specialized software in order to produce probability distributions functions for the parameters that have been derived\nin a statistically rigorous manner.\nIn section II we review methods that have been used\nto estimate cosmological parameters from CMB measurements, plus techniques for calculating likelihoods. In section III we describe the Bayesian approach to statistical\ninference and its implementation via Markov chain Monte\nCarlo methods. In section IV we describe a methods for\napplying MCMC methods to cosmological parameter estimation with CMB data. Section V presents our conclusions.\n\napply to cosmological models with increasing complexity.\nMarginalizing over parameters will also become difficult if\none no longer assumes that the variables are log-normally\ndistributed, or if the cosmological CMB anisotropy signal\nis actually non-Gaussian [25,26].\nNumerical maximization techniques used in maximum\nlikelihood estimation, such as the Levenberg-Marquardt\nmethod, are only guaranteed to find a local maximum.\nOnce they reached a local maximum they might get stuck\nin their search and not reach the global maximum. For\nthis reason statisticians have applied simulating annealing, which is a technique for global optimization. Simulated annealing has been attempted for cosmological parameter estimation [27,28]. Simulated annealing is related to MCMC as its core component is the Metropolis\nHastings algorithm. In this method the parameter space\nis searched in a random way. A new parameter space\npoint is reached with a probability that depends on the\nlikelihood and an effective temperature term. In the limit\nwhere the temperature approaches zero the thermodynamics of this parameter space search finds the system\napproaching the maximum of the likelihood. Stochastic methods such as these substitute deterministic integration by a statistical estimation problem. Although\nthese methods are applicable to high-dimensional problems, they can be very inefficient in certain situations.\nThe shortcomings of simulating annealing are that there\nis no guarantee that it will actually find the global maximum in finite time. The efficiency depends very much\non specifying a good cooling schedule which involves the\narbitrary and skillful choice of various cooling parameters that specify the algorithm and determine its performance.\n\nII. CURRENT STATISTICAL METHODS WITH\nCMB DATA\nA. Parameter Estimation\n\nVarious statistical approaches have attempted to estimate cosmological parameters from the CMB data. The\nmaximum likelihood is an example [19\u201321]. Likelihood\ntechniques aim at finding the values of the parameters\nthat maximize the likelihood function. However, the\nmaximum of the likelihood is not necessarily the peak\nvalue of the parameter's marginal distribution (its PDF)\nor its mean. The maximum likelihood parameter estimates will differ from the Bayes estimators. The maximum likelihood is not always good for parameter estimation; for a given parameter, the maximization depends on whether or not other parameters have been integrated out. A proper application of Bayes' theorem\nis attempted in some studies through the inclusion of\nprior distributions [1,14,20,22]. The typical approach is\nto select a range for the parameters and limit the maximum likelihood technique to that region in parameter\nspace. Sophisticated frequentist techniques are implemented in order to maximize the likelihood, such as the\nLevenberg-Marquardt method [23,24], or the downhill simplex method [20,24].\nIn the methods described above the problem of maginalizing over parameters is non-trivial. Typically the approach is to marginalize over all parameters except the\nvacuum energy density (\u03a9\u039b ) and the matter energy density (\u03a9m = \u03a9b +\u03a9cdm ). This procedure gets prohibitively\ndifficult as the number of parameters increases; in some\ncases the amount of computation can be expected to rise\nexponentially with parameter number. Hence, the techniques that have already been used will be difficult to\n\nB. Calculating the Likelihood\n\nImplicit in the problem of parameter estimation is the\ncalculation of the likelihood, namely the probability of\nobtaining the data given a particular model (and its associated parameters). The sizes of the data sets from\nCMB experiments are immense, so it is impractical to\nuse all the raw data for producing the likelihood. Instead, radical compression of the data is imperative [23].\nEven so, a precise derivation of the likelihood is very difficult [14,23,29,30]. Approximate techniques have been\ndeveloped that take as input the confidence intervals of\nthe experimental results [23,29\u201332]. Software for calculating the likelihoods, RADPACK is freely available at\nhttp://flight.uchicago.edu/knox/radpack.html [32].\nIn order to calculate the likelihood it is necessary to\nhave the angular power spectrum of this CMB anisotropy\nfor a specific model (with its associated cosmological parameters). This calculational task is accomplished by\ncode such as CMBfast [33] or CAMB [34]. This code accepts the cosmological parameters as input, and returns\nthe angular power spectrum of the CMB anisotropies, Cl .\n\n2\n\n\fP (x, dy) = p(x, y)dy + r(x)\u03b4x (dy)\n\nThese software packages serve as the work-horses of current CMB statistical work. For example, the likelihood\nhas been calculated 30,311,820 times in order to cover a\nregion in a ten-dimensional cosmological parameter space\n[14]. In other studies the likelihood was evaluated as\nneeded within the calculation [21,20].\nWith a large number of parameters it becomes impractical to marginalize by integration. So when attempts are\nmade to produce constraints in the \u03a9\u039b \u2212 \u03a9m plane approximate marginalization techniques must be applied.\nOne can estimate the parameters by accepting the values from the maximum likelihood on the parameter grid\n[35,36], and then interpolate between grid points with a\ncubic spline [14]. Another technique is to maximize the\nlikelihood with respect to all remaining parameters for a\nfixed point in the \u03a9\u039b \u2212 \u03a9m plane [21,20]. These methods\nare further complicated due to degeneracies among the\ncosmological parameters. [37]\n\nwhere p(x, x) =R 0 and \u03b4x (dy) = 1 if x \u2208 dy, 0 otherwise,\nand r(x) = 1\u2212 p(x, y)dy. It is well known that if p(x, y)\nsatisfies 'reversibility' or 'detailed balance', i.e.\nf (x)p(x, y) = f (y)p(y, x)\nthen f (x) is the invariant density of the Markov chain.\nTogether with irreducibility and aperiodicity, this gives\na sufficient condition for the convergence of the Markov\nchain to its stationary distribution, see Tierney [41] for\nfurther details.\nThe MH algorithm shares the concept of a generating density with the well-known simulation technique of\nrejection sampling.\nHowever, the candidate generating\nR\ndensity q(y|x), q(y|x)dy = 1, can now depend on the\ncurrent state x of the sampling process, and instead of\nrigorously accepting or rejecting a new candidate y, it is\naccepted with a certain acceptance probability \u03b1(y|x) also\ndepending on the current state x, and chosen such that\nthe transition probability p(x, y) = q(y|x)\u03b1(y|x) satisfies\ndetailed balance. This is met by setting\n\u001a\n\u001b\nf (y)q(x|y)\n\u03b1(y|x)) = min\n,1\nf (x)q(y|x)\n\nIII. BAYESIAN POSTERIOR COMPUTATION\nVIA MCMC\n\nThe difficulty with the Bayesian approach to parameter estimation is high-dimensional integration. To calculate the normalizing constant of the joint posterior PDF,\nfor instance, requires d-dimensional integration. Having\nobtained the joint posterior PDF of \u03b8, the posterior PDF\nof a single parameter \u03b8i of interest can be obtained by\nintegrating out all the other components, i.e.\nZ\nZ\nf (\u03b8i |z) = . . . f (\u03b8|z)d\u03b81 . . . d\u03b8i\u22121 d\u03b8i+1 . . . d\u03b8d .\n\nif f (x)q(y|x)) > 0 and \u03b1(y|x) = 1 otherwise. Note that\nirreducibility is guaranteed if q(y|x) is positive on the\nsupport of f .\nThe steps of the MH algorithm are therefore:\nStep 0:\n\nCalculation of the posterior mean\nR of \u03b8i necessitates a further integration, e.g. E[\u03b8i |z] = \u03b8i f (\u03b8i |z)d\u03b8i .\nAs the joint posterior is too complex to sample from\ndirectly, we propose to use a MCMC method [17,38]. Instead of generating a sequence of independent samples\nfrom the joint posterior, in MCMC a Markov chain is\nconstructed, whose equilibrium distribution is just the\njoint posterior. Thus, after running the Markov chain\nfor a certain \"burn-in\" period, one obtains (correlated)\nsamples from the limiting distribution, provided that the\nMarkov chain has reached convergence.\nOne method for generating a Markov chain is via the\nMetropolis-Hastings algorithm. The MH algorithm was\ndeveloped by Metropolis et al. [39] and generalized by\nHastings [40]. It is a MCMC method which means that it\ngenerates a Markov chain whose equilibrium distribution\nis just the target density, here the joint posterior PDF\nf (\u03b8|z). For ease of notation, let us assume that the target density is some f (x), where x can be d-dimensional.\nThen a Markov chain is specified by constructing a transition kernel P (x, A), giving the conditional probability\nto move from state x to a point in A \u2208 B, the Borel \u03c3field on IRd . As the probability to stay in the current\nstate x, P (x, {x}), is not necessarily 0, we assume that\nthe transition kernel can be expressed as\n\nStart with an arbitrary value x0\n\nStep i + 1: Generate y from q(.|xi ) and u from U (0, 1)\nIf u \u2264 \u03b1(y|xi ) set xi+1 = y (acceptance)\nIf u > \u03b1(y|xi ) set xi+1 = xi (rejection)\nThe MH algorithm does not require the normalization\nconstant of the target density. The outcomes from the\nMH algorithm can be regarded as a sample from the invariant density only after a certain 'burn-in' period. For\nissues concerning convergence diagnostics, the reader is\nreferred to Cowles and Carlin [42]. Note that an important special case of the MH algorithm is the 'independence chain' where q(y|x) = q(y), i.e. a new candidate is\ngenerated independently of the current state x.\nVarious methods to assess convergence, i.e. methods\nused for establishing whether an MCMC algorithm has\nconverged and whether its output can be regarded as\nsamples from the target distribution of the Markov chain,\nhave been developed and implemented in CODA [43].\nCODA is a menu-driven collection of SPLUS functions\nfor analyzing the output of the Markov chain. Besides\ntrace plots and the usual tests for convergence, CODA\ncalculates statistical summaries of the posterior distributions and kernel density estimates.\n3\n\n\fThe generated chain of parameter values would form\nthe set from which the statistical properties would be\nderived. After running the Markov chain for a certain\n\"burn-in\" period (in order for the Markov chain to reach\nconvergence) one obtains (correlated) samples from the\nlimiting distribution. This process would continue for\na sufficiently long time (as determined by convergence\ndiagnostics [43]).\nAfter the burn-in the frequency of appearance of parameters would represent the actual posterior density of\nthe parameter. From the posterior density one can then\ncreate confidence intervals. Summary statistics are produced from the distribution, such as posterior mean and\nstandard deviation. A cross-correlation matrix is also\neasily produced; this would be of great importance for\nquantifying the \"degeneracy\" of \u03a9m and \u03a9m [37]. A\ndistinct advantage of the MCMC approach is that computational time scales linearly with parameter number.\nHence, the MCMC approach to cosmological parameter estimation may provide the best strategy when testing complex models with numerous parameters. Also,\nMCMC methods could work with the exact form of the\nlikelihood, although the approximate forms may prove to\nbe sufficiently adequate [23,29,31,32].\nThe above method would constitute the simplest implementation of the Metropolis-Hastings method, that of\nan independence chain. We have just used an acceptance\nprobability \u03b1(\u03b8 \u2217 |\u03b8), defined by\n\u001a\n\u001b\nf (z|\u03b8 \u2217 )q(\u03b8|\u03b8\u2217 )\n\u03b1(\u03b8 \u2217 |\u03b8) = min\n,\n1\nf (z|\u03b8)q(\u03b8 \u2217 |\u03b8)\n\nMCMC techniques have been applied in numerous areas, from science to economics. Applications of statespace modeling in finance, e.g. stochastic volatility models applied to time series of daily exchange rates or returns of stock exchange indices, easily have 1000-5000 parameters and the Gibbs sampler shows slow convergence\ndue to high posterior correlations [44\u201346]. Specially tailored MCMC algorithms, like multi-move Gibbs samplers or Metropolis-Hastings algorithms, can markedly\nimprove the speed of convergence [47].\n\nIV. APPLYING MCMC METHODS TO CMB\nANISOTROPY DATA\n\nIt is possible for researchers to generate probability\ndensity functions for cosmological parameters from the\nCMB anisotropy data. This can be done in a Bayesian\nfashion with the MCMC serving as a means of conducting a proper marginalization over parameters. The implementation of the MCMC method would be relatively\nstraight forward. Instead of calculating the likelihood at\nuniform locations in the parameter space [14], one would\nlet the MCMC do its intelligent walk through the space.\nUniform a priori distributions for the parameters seems\nreasonable, so the MCMC would sample the parameter\nspace defined by them. Since the likelihood function can\nnot be written explicitly in terms of the cosmological parameters, but instead in terms of the CMB anisotropy\npower spectra terms Cl , it will be necessary to implement a Metropolis-Hastings MCMC routine.\nThe Markov chain would commence at a randomly se(0)\n(0)\nlected position in parameter space (\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8d ). With\nthe parameter set one would then utilize CMBfast [33]\nor CAMB [34] to generate a set of CMB anisotropy\nangular power spectrum components (Cl ),.and a likelihood would then be calculated with CMB anisotropy\ndata [23,29,31,32]. New values for the parameters\n(1)\n(1)\n(\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8d ) would be selected via sampling from the\na priori distributions. However, these values would\nnot necessarily be accepted as new values. First they\nwould be used as input to CMBfast [33] or CAMB\n[34] to generate a set of CMB anisotropy angular\npower spectrum components (Cl ), and a likelihood\nwould then be calculated with CMB anisotropy data\n[23,29,31,32]. The new values would be accepted or rejected according the to following test; a random number, u, hwould be generated between 0 andi 1. If\n(1)\n(1)\n(0)\n(0)\nu \u2264 min 1, f (z|\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8d )/f (z|\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8d ) (where\n(1)\n\nwhere the generating density q(\u03b8 \u2217 |\u03b8) is the uniform density over the parameter space and thus, in particular,\nindependent of the current state. By using uniform priors, the posterior PDFs in the acceptance probability\ncalculation reduce to the likelihoods. However, the efficiency of a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm depends crucially on the form of the generating density q(\u03b8 \u2217 |\u03b8). Just\nusing a uniform distribution that does not even depend\non the current state \u03b8 is the most simple but probably most inefficient way to accomplish the task. Even\nwith a uniform distribution, the algorithm will be irreducible/aperiodic/reversible and thus the Markov chain\nwill converge towards its stationary distribution.\nA slightly better way might be to use a uniform distribution in a neighborhood of the current \u03b8. Any\nprior information could be useful, such as correlations\nthat one could use to specify a multivariate normal centered around the current \u03b8 with a covariance matrix\nthat takes said correlations into account. The optimization of the Metropolis-Hastings MCMC strategy will\ninevitably require experimentation with the generating\ndensity q(\u03b8 \u2217 |\u03b8). While this may require some detailed\nstudy, the benefit will be the ability to generate posterior distributions for a large number of cosmological\nparameters.\n\n(1)\n\nf (z|\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8d ) is the likelihood in terms of data z and\ncosmological parameters (\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8d )) then the new parameters is accepted into the chain, if not the next chain\nelement has values equal to that of the previous state. A\nnew set of parameters would then be randomly sampled\nfrom the a priori distributions and the procedure would\ncontinue.\n\n4\n\n\fV. DISCUSSION\n[6]\n\nA proper Bayesian approach to parameter estimation\nallows one to simultaneously estimate both dynamic signals and measurement noise. MCMC methods have\ndemonstrated their importance in Bayesian parameter\nestimation problems with large numbers of parameters.\nAs cosmological models grow in complexity it will become necessary to use techniques such as those discussed\nhere in order to handle marginalization of parameters.\nFurthermore, a MCMC approach is not restricted to the\nassumption of Gaussian noise. A heavy-tailed observation error distribution such as a Student-t-distribution\nwith large degrees of freedom might be more appropriate\nto allow for crude measurement errors and ensure that\nresulting estimates will be robust against additive outliers. Non-Gaussian error distributions are readily incorporated into MCMC calculations. We therefore strongly\nadvocate the Bayesian approach via Metropolis-Hastings\nsampling in future analyses of cosmological parameter\nestimation from CMB data.\n\n[7]\n\n[8]\n[9]\n\n[10]\n[11]\n\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\n[16]\n\nThis work was supported by the Royal Society of New\nZealand Marsden Fund, the University of Auckland Research Committee, and Carleton College.\n\n[17]\n\n[18]\n[19]\n\u2217\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\n[4]\n\n[5]\n\nAuthors' email addresses:\nnchriste@carleton.edu,\nmeyer@stat.auckland.ac.nz\nP. de Bernardis, P.
