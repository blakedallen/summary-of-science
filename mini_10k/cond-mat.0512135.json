We also find that a substantial transverse component of the polarization\ncan also be present.\nPACS numbers: 61.50.Ks, 77.84.Dy, 81.05.Zx\n\nIn recent years, first-principles calculations have been\nused very successfully to explore new superlattice structures based on ABO3 perovskites and to predict their\nphysical properties.1,2,3,4 Because of the vast number of\ncombinations that can be assembled from the elemental building blocks, first-principles calculations can provide a useful way to screen for desired physical properties and to study interesting possibilities theoretically before they are grown experimentally.5,6 For example, Sai et al. predicted that a compositional perturbation that breaks inversion symmetry could increase the piezoelectric response,1 and an enhancement\nof the spontaneous polarization in BaTiO3 /SrTiO3 superlattices was predicted by Neaton et al. under certain conditions of epitaxial strain.2 Also, the breaking of tetragonal symmetry has been predicted for certain BaTiO3 /SrTiO3 superlattices,3 and new phase diagrams have been predicted for superlattices compose\nof Pb(Sc0.5+\u03bc Nb0.5\u2212\u03bc )O3 with certain layer sequences of\ncomposition \u03bc.4\nIn the present work, we propose a new kind of superlattice structure which might be grown artificially\nvia controlled layer-by-layer epitaxy techniques such as\nmolecular-beam epitaxy (MBE)7 or pulsed laser deposition (PLD).8 These contain 180\u25e6 ferroelectric domain\nwalls, but of an unusual kind. Normally, 180\u25e6 domain\nwalls in a tetragonal ferroelectric such as PbTiO3 form\nso as to obey electrical compatibility, leading to 180\u25e6 domain walls running parallel to the tetragonal (polarization) axis. This occurs because a tilting of the 180\u25e6 domain wall would lead to a polarization-induced bound\ncharge on the domain wall, leading to a large and unfavorable electrostatic energy. Forcing the introduction of\na \"head-to-head\" (HH) or a \"tail-to-tail\" (TT) domain\nwall perpendicular to the polarization direction would\npresumably cause it to become strongly metallic due to\nneutralization by free carriers.\nHowever, we propose that intentional insertion of\nchemical substitutions in certain atomic layers during\ngrowth (\"delta doping\") could provide an approximate\n\ncancellation of this bound charge, allowing for the fabrication of new kinds of superlattice structures containing\n180\u25e6 HH and TT domain walls, as illustrated in Fig. 1.\nIn this PbTiO3 example, the compensation is realized\nby substituting certain layers of Ti atoms by donor or\nacceptor atoms drawn from neighboring columns of the\nPeriodic Table. If the substitutional charge density can\nbe chosen to provide an approximate cancellation of the\nbound polarization charge of the HH or TT domain wall,\nthen one may hope to arrive at a configuration that is\nboth neutral and energetically favorable.\nIn this paper, we carry out first-principles densityfunctional calculations of superlattice structures such as\nthe 8-cell one shown in Fig. 1 as a \"proof of concept\"\nfor this idea. We find that this arrangement, with HH\nand TT domain walls at the acceptor and donor layers,\nrespectively, is a robust configuration in which there is\nno gap closure (i.e., the superlattice remains insulating).\nSomewhat surprisingly, we also find that a small transverse component of the polarization develops, leading to\nan overall spontaneous polarization of the supercell in the\n[100] direction. This can be understood as arising from\nthe imperfect compensation in this case.\nWe first select a host material for our superlattice,\nchoosing a tetragonal material and letting its c axis be\nin the superlattice growth direction. In order to attain\nperfect compensation by a donor or acceptor layer of\nDonor\nNb5+O2\n\nAcceptor\nSc3+O2\n\nC/2\n\nDonor\nNb5+O2\n\nC/2\n\nP\nTT\n\nP\nTiO2\n\nTiO2\n\nTiO2\n\nHH\n\nTiO2\n\nTiO2\n\nTiO2\n\nTT\n\n[001]\nFIG. 1: Sketch of PbTiO3 -based ferroelectric superlattice in\nwhich head-to-head and tail-to-tail 180\u25e6 domain walls coincide with acceptor (Sc) and donor (Nb) substitutional layers\nrespectively.\n\n\f2\nareal charge density \u00b1e/a2, where a is the in-plane lattice constant, we would need a material whose spontaneous polarization Ps is \u00b1e/2a2. Roughly, a \u2243 4 \u00c5 for\nmost perovskites, in which case the matching condition is\nPs = 0.50 C/m2. Taking KNbO3 , BaTiO3 , and PbTiO3\nin their tetragonal phases, these have Ps = 0.40 C/m2,\n0.27 C/m2, and 0.75 C/m2, respectively. None of them is\nideal, but we have chosen to carry out our pilot calculations here using PbTiO3 , whose polarization is somewhat\nlarger than the nominal matching value. PbTiO3 is a\ngood test system, being a well-studied prototypical ferroelectric material having a simple phase behavior, remaining in the tetragonal ferroelectric phase from T = 0 up\nto well above room temperature. Experimentally, alloy\nhost materials such as Pb1\u2212x Srx TiO3 or PbZr1\u2212x Tix O3\nmight be used to tune the concentration to achieve more\nideal matching of the polarization, but we have decided\nto limit ourselves to pure compounds for this first study.\nWe construct a 40-atom supercell by arranging 8 unit\ncells of bulk tetragonal PbTiO3 in an a \u00d7 a \u00d7 8c supercell, with initial atomic coordinates chosen to be those\nof the relaxed bulk ferroelectric structure with polarization pointing in the [001] direction throughout the supercell. We then substitute the Ti atoms in the first\nTiO2 layer by donor atoms, and the Ti atoms in the\nfifth TiO2 layer by acceptor atoms, as shown in Fig. 1.\nWe choose Nb (5+) as the donor and Sc (3+) as the\nacceptor because these atoms are commonly found on\nthe B site of other perovskite ABO3 oxides. We assume\nperfect control of the layer-by-layer composition, resulting in an ideal PbNbO3 /3\u00d7PbTiO3/PbScO3 /3\u00d7PbTiO3\nstructural sequence as shown Fig. 1.\nWe then relax the structure under a symmetry constraint that preserves the tetragonal P 4mm symmetry\n(i.e., atom displacements are allowed only in the z direction). The lattice constant is fixed in the in-plane directions, corresponding to conditions of epitaxial growth on\na bulk tetragonal PbTiO3 substrate. We also fixed the\nlattice constant along the [001] direction, assuming that\nthe volume relaxations resulting from the compensation\nwould be small. All calculations were performed at zero\ntemperature.\nThe first-principles calculations were carried out using the Vienna ab-initio simulations package (VASP)9 , in\nwhich density-functional theory within the local-density\napproximation10 is implemented. A plane-wave basis set\nand projector augmented-wave potentials11 were used\nwith a 400 eV energy cutoff for the electronic wavefunctions. Brillouin zone integrations were performed\non a Monkhorst-Pack mesh of dimensions 4\u00d74\u00d72 and\n10\u00d710\u00d72 for structural relaxation and density-of-states\n(DOS) calculations respectively. The ionic relaxation was\nconsidered to be achieved when the Hellmann-Feynman\nforces on the ions were less than 3 meV/\u00c5.\nWe find that the structural relaxation converges towards a structure in which the polarization reverses in\nthe top half of the unit cell and the system acquires an\nMz mirror symmetry across the planes containing the\n\ndonor and acceptor atoms, converting these layers into\n180\u25e6 TT and HH domain walls as anticipated in Fig. 1.\nWhen we observed this apparent convergence towards the\nhigher-symmetry P 4/mmm structure, we carried out the\nfinal relaxation with this P 4/mmm symmetry enforced,\nand confirmed that the resulting structure had a lower\nenergy.\nIn order to test whether this P 4/mmm is really the\nstructural ground state, we gave additional small displacements to the atoms in order to break the tetragonal symmetry, and carried out further relaxations. Surprisingly, we found that the system is unstable to the\ngrowth of an in-plane component of the polarization. We\ntested both initial [100] displacements and initial [110]\ndisplacements (preserving, in both cases, the Mz symmetry), giving rise to P mm2 and Amm2 structures, respectively. We find that the relaxed P mm2 structure has an\nenergy 0.065 eV lower than that of the P 4/mmm structure, while the relaxed Amm2 one is 0.057 eV lower than\nthe P 4/mmm. Thus, we find that the P mm2 structure\nis our final structural ground state.\nTo get a better sense of the electronic structure of the\nrelaxed structures, we computed the electronic density\nof states (DOS). The results, shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b)\nfor the P 4/mmm and P mm2 structures respectively, indicate that the compensation is successful and the entire superlattice is insulating. (The DOS for the Amm2\nstructure looks very similar to these.) The final gap of\n1.46 eV is moderately smaller, but not drastically smaller,\nthan the gap of 1.78 eV for bulk tetragonal PbTiO3 . (As\nthese gaps are computed using the LDA, they should be\nregarded as underestimates of the true gaps.)\nWe also checked what happens if there is no compensation between the polarization-induced bound charge and\nthe donor/acceptor layer. To do this, we constructed a\n40-atom P 4/mmm supercell similar to that of Fig. 2(a),\nbut without introducing the impurity layers. (Actually,\nthis was done by imposing the displacement pattern of\nthe ferroelectric tetragonal ground state of PbTiO3 , but\nwith opposite signs in the bottom and top halves of the\nsupercell.) The result is shown if Fig. 2(c), where it is\nclear that the structure is strongly metallic. Thus, the\ncompensation by the donor and acceptor layers is essential in order to arrive at an overall insulating structure.\nWe return now to the pattern of ground-state atomic\ndisplacements that we calculated for the P 4/mmm and\nP 2mm structures of Fig. 2(a) and (b), and interpret these\nin terms of a local polarization in each unit cell. To do\nthis, we model the local polarization as12\ne X\nw\u03b1 Z\u2217\u03b1 * u(i)\n(1)\nP(i) =\n\u03b1 ,\n\u03a9c \u03b1\nwhere i is the Pb-centered unit cell index, \u03b1 runs over all\natoms, and w\u03b1 is a weight factor that is unity inside the\ncell, zero outside, and takes appropriate fractional values\nfor atoms shared with a neighboring cell.12 For the dynamical effective charge tensors Z\u2217\u03b1 , we use bulk PbTiO3\nvalues of Z \u2217 (Pb)=3.90, Z \u2217 (Ti)=7.06, Zk\u2217 (O)=\u22125.83, and\n\n\f3\nGap=0.95 eV\n\n0.8\n\n(a)\n\nGap=1.46 eV\n\n(b)\n\nMetallic\n\n(c)\n\nLocal Polarization (C/m 2)\n\nDensity df States\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n\nSc\n\n2\n\nNb\n\nTi\n\nTi\n\nTi\n1\n\n3\n\n4\n\nTi\n5\n\nTi\n6\n\nSc\n\nTi\n7\n\n8\n\nP along [100]\nP along [001]\n\n-0.6\n-0.8\nPb centered cell index of superlattice\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\nEnergy (eV)\n\nFIG. 2: Density of states (DOS) of 40-atom PbTiO3 supercells considered in the text.

The local polarization in\nthe [001] direction changes sign across the dopant layers,\nconfirming that HH and TT domain walls are formed.\nIn addition, there is a roughly uniform polarization in\nthe [100] direction, although it is slightly enhanced in\nthe vicinity of the HH and TT domain walls where the\n[001] polarization is crossing through zero. Thus, the entire superlattice structure is antiferroelectric as concerns\nthe [001] polarizations, but is ferroelectric in the [100]\ndirection. (The Pz profile of the P 4/mmm-constrained\nstructure is not shown, but it is almost identical to that\nof the P mm2 structure.)\nIn order to understand our results, recall that PbTiO3\nhas a spontaneous polarization of 0.734e/a2, somewhat\nlarger than the ideal value of 0.5e/a2 that would give\nperfect compensation of the donor and acceptor layers.\nIf each domain were to develop its full bulk spontaneous polarization, there would be substantial charges\n(\u00b10.47e/a2) at the donor layers due to overcompensation by the domain walls. The resulting depolarizing field\nwould reduce Pz to a value much closer to, but still larger\nthan, the reference value of 0.5e/a2. This is precisely\nwhat we see in Fig. 3; in the middle of each domain, Pz\nattains a value just slightly larger than 0.5e/a2.\nThe appearance of the polarization in the in-plane direction can be understood based on the concept of polar-\n\nFIG. 3: Local polarization profile of the relaxed P mm2 structure. The [001] component changes sign at the dopant layers,\nwhile the [100] component is roughly uniform throughout the\nsupercell, giving rise to an overall polarization in the [100]\ndirection. Dotted lines indicate the \"ideal\" value 0.5e/a2 ;\ndashed lines represent the spontaneous polarization of bulk\ntetragonal PbTiO3 .\n\nization rotation. Many previous works14 have provided\nsupport for a picture in which the crystal is regarded as\nhaving a preferred magnitude of the polarization, with a\nrather weak crystalline anisotropy determining its direction. If the polarization is prevented from attaining its\npreferred bulk value in the [001] direction, it can still remain close to this preferred magnitude by tilting off this\naxis. Indeed, the resulting magnitude of the polarization\nin the middle layers of the slab, 0.57e/a2, is only slightly\nlower than the preferred bulk value. Moreover, this picture naturally helps explain why the in-plane component\nof the polarization grows near the HH and TT domain\nwalls, where Pz is in the process of crossing through zero.\nFig. 4 gives further evidence of the physical picture\noutlined above. Here, we have plotted the site-projected\nDOS for Ti atoms sitting on three different TiO2 layers of the P mm2 supercell. Specifically, Ti(Nb) is a Ti\natom sitting next to the donor-compensated (NB) plane;\nTi(Sc) sits next to the acceptor-compensated (Sc) plane;\nand Ti(Mid) is a Ti atom midway between the two impurity layers. The zero of energy is at the valence-band\nmaximum. The vertical dashed line provides a reference\nthat helps clarify that the spectral weight of the conduction band, and in particular its low-energy edge, shifts to\nhigher energies as one progresses from the Ti(Sc) to the\nTi(Nb) layer. The smallness of these shifts confirms that\nthe compensation is quite good, and the small shift that\ndoes occur can be attributed to the leftover depolarization field in the [001] direction. Furthermore, the sign of\nthis effect is consistent with our previous conjecture that\nthe domain walls are slightly under-compensated.\nIt is interesting to ask what will happen for superlattices of longer and longer period in the c direction,\nfor a given material system. Unless the compensation is\nperfect, the depolarizing fields resulting from the imper-\n\n\f4\n\n'd' Density of States on Ti\n\nTi(Sc)\n\nTi(Mid)\n\nTi(Nb)\n\n1\n\n2\n3\nEnergy (eV)\n\n4\n\nFIG. 4: DOS projected onto three different Ti atoms in the\nP mm2 supercell. Ti(Sc) denotes the Ti atom in the TiO2\nlayer closest to the ScO2 layer; Ti(Nb) denotes the Ti atom\nin the TiO2 layer closest to the NbO2 layer; and Ti(Mid)\ndenotes a Ti atom in the middle of the supercell, between the\ntwo dopant layers.\n\nfect compensation should result in an electrostatic potential having a sawtooth dependence on z. This should\nbe sufficient to close the gap, and drive the superlattice\nstructure metallic, when the amplitude of this sawtooth\npotential exceeds the band gap. We can estimate the\ncritical superlattice period for the PbTiO3 /Sc/Nb system by recalling that we estimated a net bare charge of\n2Ps \u2212 e/a2 \u2243 0.47 e/a2 or about 0.51 C/m2 . Taking the\ntheoretical value of the bulk band gap of Eg = 1.8 eV and\na bulk dielectric constant of about 110, we estimate that\nthe depolarization field would close the band gap when\nthe distance L between impurity layers exceeds a critical\nvalue of about 75 \u00c5 or about 19 PbTiO3 layers.\nIf it is desired to increase the superlattice period and\nstill keep an insulating structure, then the precision of\nthe compensation should be improved. Two approaches\nsuggest themselves. First, one could make use of mixed\ndopant layers of composition Ti1\u2212x Scx or Ti1\u2212x Nbx ,\nwith x tuned to obtain the correct degree of compensation for a given bulk material. Second, the bulk material\nitself may be varied in order to adjust its spontaneous\npolarization closer to the ideal value of 0.5 e/a2 . For example, replacing PbTiO3 by PbZrx Ti1\u2212x O3 (PZT) with\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nN. Sai, B. Meyer, and D. Vanderbilt, Phys. Rev. Lett. 84,\n5636 (2000).\nJ. B. Neaton and K. M. Rabe, Appl. Phys.

In the system we chose for study, in which Sc\nand Nb substitutional layers provide the compensation\nin PbTiO3 , the spontaneous polarization of the bulk material is larger than the ideal value; consequently, the superlattice develops an in-plane ferroelectric polarization,\nwhile also developing the expected antiferroelectric domain structure in the growth direction. This appears to\nbe a novel way of forcing polarization rotation into the inplane orientation in PbTiO3 , and it would be interesting\nto explore how the superlattice properties (spontaneous\npolarization, Curie temperature, etc.) could be tuned by\nthe growth conditions (e.g., superlattice period). More\ngenerally, it would be interesting to investigate other host\nperovskite ferroelectric materials, other kinds of compensating layers (including, perhaps, dopants from column II\nor VI of the periodic table), and alloy compositions of the\nbulk and/or dopant layers. With a more suitable matching of the compensation, the driving force for polarization\nrotation could be reduced, and a true P 4/mmm superlattice structure could presumably be stabilized. In fact,\nit also seems possible that a normally rhombohedral bulk\nferroelectric like BaTiO3 whose spontaneous polarization\nis smaller than the ideal value of 0.5 e/a2 could have its\npolarization rotated in the opposite way, into alignment\nwith the z-axis, since in this case the compensating layers\nwould enhance the polarization in that direction. Finally,\nmuch longer-period superlattices might be obtained by\nvery accurate matching of the compensation. There are\nthus many open avenues for future theoretical and experimental studies.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe work was supported by ONR Grants N00014-97-10048 and N00014-05-1-0054 and by the Center for Piezoelectrics by Design under ONR Grant N00014-01-1-0365.\nWe wish to thank M.
