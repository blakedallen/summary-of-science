In the chain leading from a\nmanuscript's submission to an editor's decision, the identification of competent referees constitutes a crucial first step;\nit will shape the quality and reliability of the subsequent\nreviewing.\nReferee identification has mainly been a human-driven\nprocess; editors and conference organizers rely on their subjective assessments of a particular domain and the submission's content to identify a set of appropriate referees. However, it is not at all certain that editors have complete knowledge of all potentially competent referees for a particular\nmanuscript, and, even if that were the case, that they are\nalways able to produce an objective, good match between\nthe manuscript and this pool of potential referees. Research\nhas in fact indicated the peer-review process is subject to numerous sources of biases and unreliability, many of which are\nundoubtedly caused by mismatches between a manuscript\nand its referees [18]. Furthermore, with the advent of open\ncommentary peer-review systems for pre-print repositories\n[17] such as Naboj1 and web journals such as Interjournal2\nand Philica3 , the requirements for an efficient peer-review\nprocess has changed. When any reader can submit a review, separating the 'wheat from the chaff' becomes a high\npriority to validly assess the quality of a manuscript. Locating referees to review a specific manuscript is thus gradually becoming less important as identifying which of the\nmany provided reviews originate from actual experts in the\nmanuscript's domain.\nA number of automated referee identification algorithms\nhave been proposed in the literature to more objectively\nand efficiently match a submitted manuscript to a set of\ncompetent, i.e., expert referees. Previously published algorithms have mostly relied on matching referee-provided\ntextual indicators of interest, e.g. key terms, to the contents of manuscripts. Dumais et al (1992) and Yarowsky\net al (1999) [9, 22] use Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) to\nmatch manuscript abstract to referees. Other approaches\ndetermine referee expertise via web mining techniques [1],\nand/or asking authors and the referees to provide keyterms\ndescribing their manuscript and area of expertise respectively [11]. However, it is not feasible to require all individuals in the scientific community to report on their interest\n1\n\nNaboj available at: http://www.naboj.com/\nInterJournal available at: http://www.interjournal.org/\n3\nPhilica available at: http://www.philica.com/\n2\n\n\fand expertise in this manner. Nor is it feasible to perform\nlatent semantic indexing on the websites and/or articles of\nall scientists in the community due to costs associated with\ntext analysis on a large data set. Applications of the mentioned referee identification algorithms have therefore been\nrestricted to situations in which such information can be obtained for a pre-selected set of individuals, e.g. conferences\nand workshops. They have consequently failed to gain acceptance in the domain of classic journal peer-review and\nopen commentary peer-review.\nThis article proposes a referee identification algorithm that\nis both computationally inexpensive and requires no intervention on behalf of the authors, journal editors, and/or conference organizers. The proposed algorithm identifies appropriate referees for a manuscript by applying a particle-swarm\nalgorithm to a co-authorship network. A particle-swarm is\na discrete form of the spreading activation algorithm of information retrieval [6, 8]. In short, the proposed algorithm\nprovides a context-specific weight for every individual represented in the co-authorship network, where the context is\nthe paper required for review. The context-specific aspect of\nthe algorithm places the algorithm into the class of relative\nrank algorithms (i.e. ranking with priors) [21]. Furthermore,\nthis context-sensitive weighting provides a strong incentive\nfor its use in open commentary peer-review. To date, no\nsuch referee weighting algorithm has been proposed in the\nliterature.\nThe algorithm's performance is validated against referee\nbid data provided by the program chair and steering committee of the 2005 Joint Conference on Digital Libraries\n(JCDL) [19]. We show how the algorithm can properly identify appropriate referees and, in some cases, conflicts of interests, and suggest how its accuracy can be improved by\nincluding additional data sources.\n\n2.\n\nTHE PROPOSED REFEREE IDENTIFICATION ALGORITHM\n\nThe referee identification algorithm presented in this paper is dependent upon:\n1. a co-authorship network data structure\n2. a relative-rank particle-swarm propagation algorithm\nOur approach is based on the premise that a manuscript's\nsubject domain can be represented by the authors of its references. Starting from those authors, we can identify related authors in a co-authorship network who may be potential referees for the submitted manuscript. To locate\nsuch related authors, a particle-swarm starting, from the\nreferenced authors, diffuses an energy distribution over a\nco-authorship network in a manner similar to the spreading\nactivation techniques used for information retrieval [8], but\nin a discrete form related to the random walker algorithms\nof Markov chain analysis [2]. However, unlike the iterative\nalgorithms that identify a stationary distribution such as\nPageRank [5] and eigenvector centrality [4, 20], the proposed\nalgorithm does not generate nor presuppose a particular network topology (e.g. aperiodic and connected). PageRank\nand eigenvector centrality algorithms are global rank metrics in that the initial distribution of energy in the network\ndoes not effect the final energy distribution when the algorithm has converged to a steady state vector. Instead, the\nproposed algorithm is a relative rank algorithm in that the\n\ninitial distribution of energy, or particles, in the network\ndetermines the final author ranking [21]. The relative rank\nalgorithm proposed in [21] uses a \"back probability\" to allow\nwalkers to \"teleport\" to their original source node. In this\nmanner, a steady state vector is achieved that biases the\nfinal energy distribution in the network towards the source\nnodes. The relative rank algorithm in [21] and [10] maintains many similarities to the particle propagation algorithm\nproposed in this article. At the end of the particle propagation algorithm, the relative energy between authors represents the relative competency of each author represented in\nthe co-authorship network with respects to the manuscript.\nThis section will first discuss an algorithm to construct a\nco-authorship network from a digital library repository and\nwill then provide a formal representation of the particleswarm algorithm used to locate referees in the resulting coauthorship network.\n\n2.1\n\nConstructing a Co-Authorship Network\n\nA co-authorship network is defined by a graph composed\nof nodes that represent authors and edges that represent\na joint publication between two authors [15]. Therefore,\na co-authorship network is represented by the tuple G =\n(N, E, W ), where N is the set of nodes, one for each author, in the network, E is the set of edges relating the various authors, and W is the set of weights representing the\nstrength of tie between any two collaborating authors. In\nother words, any edge, el,j , connects two authors, nl and\nnj , with a respective weight of wl,j \u2208 R+ . The edge weight\nbetween any two authors is determined by Eq. 1.\nwl,j = wj,l =\n\nX\n\u2200m\u2208M by l,j\n\n1\nA(m) \u2212 1\n\n(1)\n\nThis equation represents two considerations. First, when\nthe total number of authors for a manuscript, given by the\nfunction A(m), is high, the resulting co-authorship weights\nwill be low since the weight is distributed amongst the full\nof set of collaborating authors. This is represented by the\n1\nfraction A(m)\u22121\nwhere A(m) returns the total number of\nauthors for manuscript m. Second, the more frequently two\nauthors co-author in the bibliographic record, the higher\ntheir co-authorship\nweight. The latter is represented by the\nP\nsummation,\n\u2200m\u2208M by l,j , where M denotes the set of all\nmanuscripts in a collection and m \u2208 M . This method of coauthorship network construction is borrowed from [12, 14,\n13]. The co-authorship network construction algorithm runs\nin O(|M |).\nThe mentioned particle-swarm algorithm computed on the\nco-authorship network is a random process that requires\nthe outgoing edge weights of a node to be represented as a\nprobability distribution. Therefore, the\nP co-authorship edge\nweights must be normalized such that \u2200el,j \u2208out(nl ) wl,j = 1\nwhere out(nl ) is the set of outgoing edges from node nl .\n\n2.2\n\nPropagating a Particle-Swarm\n\nThe purpose of the particle-swarm algorithm is to map\na manuscript to a set of potential referees. Since a coauthorship network only expresses the relationship between\nauthors, a manuscript will be represented as the set of authors in the manuscript's bibliography. Let the set Q represent the set of authors cited in the bibliography of a particular article. For every author element nl \u2208 Q, there exists\n\n\fa corresponding unique node in the co-authorship network.\nTherefore, Q \u2286 N . A distribution of particles, P , start their\njourney at Q and propagate over the co-authorship network\nvia the network edges. Any particle, pi \u2208 P , is composed of\nthree components: an energy value, a energy decay property,\na pointer to its current nodal location.\n\n0.75\n\n1.0\n0.5\n\n0.25\n\n1.0\n\n1. \u000fi (t) \u2208 R: is the amount of energy contained within\nthe particle pi at time t\n\n0.5\n1.0\n1.0\n\n2. \u03b4i \u2208 [0, 1]: is the decay parameter governing the loss\nof energy as the particle pi propagates through the\nnetwork\nt=1\n\nt=2\n\nt=3\n\nt=4\n\n3. ci (t) \u2208 N : is the location of the particle pi at time t\nEvery node in the co-authorship network has an accompanying energy value represented by a scalar within the energy\nvector e \u2208 R|N | . For instance, node nl 's energy value is el .\nThe energy value for a node is incremented, or decremented,\nas particles traverse the node. At time t = 1 there exists an\nenergy distribution only over the set Q such that for all\nnl \u2208 Q, el (1) > 0. This means that at t = 1, only those author nodes that are references in the manuscript contain an\nenergy value greater than 0. Furthermore, the more often a\nparticular author is referenced by the manuscript, the more\nparticles that author's node will initially receive at t = 1.\nTherefore, if author nl is referenced once and author nj is\nreferenced twice, then nj will have twice as many initial\nparticles.\nA particle moves through the co-authorship network by\nrandomly selecting one outgoing edge from its current node,\nci (t). The edge that is chosen is biased by the outgoing\nprobability distribution where higher weighted edges have a\nhigher probability of being chosen for traversal by the particle. This function is represented as \u03b8 : out(ci (t)) \u2192 el,j . At\neach time step a particle propagates to a neighboring node\nand updates the current node's energy value, eci (t) according\nto Eq. 2.\neci (t) (t + 1) = eci (t) (t) + \u000fi (t)\n\n(2)\n\nOnce the particle has deposited its current energy value,\nit decays the energy value according to \u03b4i before moving to\nthe next node in the network.

Therefore, the particleswarm algorithm maps a set of authors (references in the\noriginal manuscript Q) to a set of authors (referees in R)\nwithin the co-authorship network, f : Q \u2192 R.

The\nparticle population can either be small in order to simulate\na discrete random walker process or large to simulate a continuous spreading activation process. For the purpose of this\nstudy, we were more interested in the latter process. Furthermore, by increasing the initial particle population size,\nthe random effects of the stochastic particle propagation algorithm are reduced. Our initial particle population for a\nsingle reference was 100 particles. If an author is referenced\nmore than once, then their initial particle population was\n4\n\nIn our test implementation, for a single article using the\nDBLP, the average run-time was 1.674 seconds on Intel Core\nDuo using Java 1.5.\n\n\f3.\n\n#distribute particles: O(|P |);\nint i = 1;\nforeach (nl \u2208 Q) do\nint particlesP erN ode = 100;\nfor (j = 0, j < particlesP erN ode, j++) do\n\u000fi = 1.0; \u03b4i = 0.15; ci = nl ;\ni++;\nend\nend\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\nThe 77 members of the 2005 JCDL program committee\nare asked to indicate their reviewing preferences in advance\nof the reviewing assignments, i.e. they bid on the submissions they wish to review. While there were 281 submissions\nto the 2005 JCDL, only 124 submissions had bid data for\nall program committee members. When bidding, the PC\nmembers can choose from the following bid codes:\n\n#propagate particles: O(|P |k);\nint t = 1;\nwhile (t \u2264 k) do\nfor (i = 0, i < |P |, i++) do\nif (\u000fi > 0) then\neci = eci + \u000fi ;\n\u000fi = (1 \u2212 \u03b4i ) \u2217 \u000fi ;\nif (|out(ci )| == 0) then\n\u000fi = 0\nend\nelse\nci = \u03b8(out(ci ));\nend\nend\nend\nt++;\nend\n\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n\n1 I am an expert in the domain of the submission and want\nto review\n2 I am an expert in the domain of the submission\n3 I am not an expert in the domain of the submission\n4 There exists a conflict of interest\n\nAlgorithm 1: Particle-Swarm algorithm\n\n100x where x is the number of references to that author.\nThe parameter k and \u03b4 have a similar effect on the network.\nIf \u03b4 is high, then the amount of energy in the network as k\nincreases drops quickly since decay is a geometric progression with a negative common ratio. Thus, as k \u2192 \u221e, the\neffect of the particles on the final energy distribution diminishes to near 0. For this reason, we set k to 100 since at 100\nsteps, the amount of energy in a particle is 8.74 \u00d7 10\u22128 and\nthus nearly equivalent to an infinite k.

However, when applying this\nalgorithm to a different data set, various parameter space\nsearch algorithms can be used in association with human\nvalidation to find the most appropriate \u03b4 parameter for that\nparticular community.\n\nThe 2005 JCDL bid data provides a complete overview\nof which PC member actually volunteered to review which\nsubmissions. Ideally, the algorithm's referee predictions for\na particular manuscript should correspond with the 2005\nJCDL PC members that volunteered to review the same\nmanuscript. Our evaluation of the effectiveness of the proposed referee identification algorithm therefore rests on a\ncomparison of the particle energy values a PC member receives and their actual bid codes.\nThe algorithm requires a co-authorship network to generate sets of potential referees. The co-authorship network\nchosen for this experiment was constructed using the Digital Bibliography and Library Project5 (DBLP) bibliographic\ndataset. This dataset is composed mainly of computer science journal and conference manuscripts (for which the digital library agenda is a sub-domain). The constructed network has 284,082 author nodes and 2,167,018 co-authorship\nedges. Of the 77 PC members, 8 were not found within\nthe DBLP. Thus, 89% of the PC members were found in the\nDBLP. For those members not in the DBLP, their bid behavior was excluded from the following analysis. Furthermore,\n22 articles did not have identifiable authors in the DBLP.\nThus, only 83% of the articles with bid data had authors in\nthe DBLP. Figure 3 diagrams the distribution of authors and\nauthor references found in the DBLP. Finally, no advanced\nname disambiguation algorithm was used. Only when the\nlast name, first initial, and middle initial match did we consider that a positive identification.\nThis section will first discuss the general methodology of\nthe algorithm validation and then provide the results of a\ncomparison of the 2005 JCDL bid codes and the algorithms\nreferee predictions for the 2005 JCDL submissions.\n\n3.1\n\nMethodological Overview\n\nThe proposed referee identification algorithm can be said\nto produce valid results if its referee predictions match the\nactual 2005 JCDL PC bid codes. For example, a PC member who entered bid code 1 (expert wanting to review) for a\nparticular manuscript should ideally receive a higher particle\nenergy value than a PC member who entered bid code 3 (not\nan expert). Since this should be the case for all manuscripts,\nthe overall effectiveness of the algorithm can be determined\n5\nDBLP available\ntrier.de/\u223cley/db/\n\nat:\n\nhttp://www.informatik.uni-\n\n\f6\n\n30\n\n4\n3\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nnumber of submissions\n\n5\n\n25\n20\n15\n10\n\nnumber of submissions\n\n5\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\nnumber of authors\n\nFigure 3:\nDBLP\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\na.) authors per paper found in the DBLP b.) referenced authors per submission found in the\n\ne1 \u2248 e2 > e3 \u2248 e4 .\n\n(6)\n\nThe idea of matching particle energy assignment to actual\nPC member bid codes is outlined in Figure 4 where S1 refers\nto submission number 1 and P1 refers to program committee\nmember number 1.\nTo test the degree to which PC member bid codes and\nthe proposed algorithm's particle energy values overlap, each\nsubmitted manuscript in 2005 JCDL submission archive is\nparsed to extract its references using the Paracite6 toolkit.\nThe referenced authors in the DBLP co-authorship network\nare then each supplied with 100 particles where \u000f = 1.0,\n\u03b4 = 0.15, and k = 100. At k = 100, the energy level of\na particle is near zero, (1 \u2212 0.85)100 . The particle-swarm\nalgorithm propagates the initial positive energy from the\nsubmission's bibliographic reference nodes to other scientists\nin the DBLP co-authorship network via the network edges\nas described in the previous section (Algorithm 1). The\ngenerated particle energy for each PC member is recorded\nand added to the particular PC member's bid code for that\nmanuscript. The accumulated particular energy values for\neach bid code can then be examined to determine how well\nthey match the inequality given by Eq. 6.\n\n6\n\n80\n\nnumber of author references\n\nby summing the energy values of all PC members who entered a particular bid code and comparing the resulting total\nenergy values across bid codes. This means that PC members whose bids indicate they are experts (bid codes 1 and\n2) should receive significantly higher energy values over all\nsubmissions than those whose bids indicated they are not\nexperts (3). If this is the case, it can be said the algorithm's\nparticle energy values successfully predict which PC member\nshould be refereeing a particular manuscript.\nIn fact, if we'd denote the total particle energy e assigned\nto any particular bid code b as eb , then the final distribution\nof particle energy most indicative of the effectiveness of the\nreferee identification and weighting algorithm would be\n\n3.2\n\n60\n\nThe Results of the Proposed Algorithms\n\nParaCite available at: http://paracite.eprints.org/developers/\n\n2005 JCDL\nSubmitted\nManuscripts\n\nJCDL\nProgram\nComitte\n\nProposed\nCo-Authorship\nAlgoritm\nEnergy\nValues\nP1\n\nSubmission\nBids\nP2\n\nP1\n\nS1\n\nS1\n\nS2\n\nS2\n\nBid Category 1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nP2\n\n4\n\nFigure 4: Methodology for validating the proposed\nalgorithm\n\nParticle energy values were generated for the entire 2005\nJCDL submission archive and compared to the PC members\nbid codes.

Table 1 provides the p-values. In line with the hypothesis, the proposed referee identification algorithm is able to\nmake a statistically significant distinction between expert,\nnon-expert, and conflict of interest referees. The algorithm,\nhowever, cannot make a significant distinction between experts and experts wanting review (bid groups 1 and 2). This\ncould mean that the co-authorship network does not contain\ninformation about current research interest of a scientist,\nonly their domain of expertise.\nThe results demonstrate that conflict of interest referees\nare assigned a significant amount of energy. This would be\nexpected since conflict of interests are usually closely related\nin expertise to the author of the submission (i.e. are the author themselves or have co-authored with the author previously). The reason that authors of the submission receive\nan excessive amount of energy is due in large part to the\nfact that authors cite themselves more often than not and\ntherefore would receive a high energy amount with respect\nto their own manuscript. Individuals who have co-authored\nwith the authors of the submission (those individuals one\nstep away from the authors in the co-authorship network)\nwould also tend to receive a large amount of energy. If energy is a measure of the amount of decision-making influence\nthat a referee should have with respects to the manuscript\nthen it is desirable to ensure that conflict of interest referees\nreceive no positive particle energy. Therefore, the next section will provide a modification to the proposed algorithm in\norder to reduce the amount of energy that conflict of interest\nreferees receive.\n\n3.3\n\nConflict of Interest Reduction by Negative\nParticle Energy\n\nThis section outlines an extension to the algorithm aimed\nat reducing the degree to which conflict of interest referees\nreceive particle energy. In the modified algorithm, a negative energy swarm is placed at the submission author nodes\nas shown in Figure 7. This negative energy particle-swarm\nwill negate the energy otherwise assigned to the manuscript\nauthors themselves and those individuals most closely related. It is hypothesized that this will reduce the amount of\nenergy received by conflict of interest referees.\nA negative energy particle was defined with the following\nproperties: \u000f = \u22121000.0, \u03b4 = 0.0. Obviously, if the coauthorship network is connected, then a 'black-out' swarm\nwith no decay that can propagate indefinitely will remove all\npositive energy in the network. Therefore, the propagation\ndepth or steps, k, of the negative energy particles is varied\nto control the neighborhood in which their inhibitive effects\ntake place.\nFigure 8 denotes the total amount of energy for all sub-\n\nFigure 7: The application of positive and negative\nenergy particle-swarms\n\nmissions in each bid category after k number of 'black-out'\npropagations and the average energy for any one individual\nin that bid category. The more steps the swarm is allowed\nto propagate, the more energy removed from the network.\nThus, it is important to stop that 'black-out' swarm from\nremoving all energy in the network. As presented in Figure\n8, the most optimal k, i.e. depth of propagation, for the\nnegative energy particle-swarm is approximately 2. Indeed,\nat k \u2248 2, the proportion of energy located at expert referees is the greatest, and the proportion of energy located\nat conflict of interest and non-expert referees is the lowest.\nNote that when the propagation algorithm is complete, any\nnode with less than 0 energy has 0 energy added to their\nrespective bid category. It should be noted that the negative energy particles have the same effect on e as setting all\nnodes energy in the k-neighborhood of the author node(s)\nto 0. However, in theory, since this is a stochastic process,\nit is possible for the 'black-out' swarm to not reach all k\nneighbors. Furthermore, k = 0 is when no 'black-out' is distributed to the manuscript's author node(s) and therefore is\nequivalent to the original version of the algorithm.\nFigure 9 shows the energy distributions on a log/linear\nscale for the most optimal k for the 'black out' swarm. What\nis apparent is that for all referee types, except conflict of\ninterest referees, the energy distribution remains relatively\nunchanged. This further demonstrates that most conflict of\ninterest referees are located, in the co-authorship network,\nin the vicinity of the submission's author(s) because as particle energy decays over time, the highest energy values are\ndistributed early in the diffusion process.

Unfortunately,\nnot all conflict of interest referee energy is reduced to zero.\nThis may be because co-authorship relationships are not the\nonly reason that conflict of interest situations emerge. We\ncan only speculate that the incorporation of other relational\ninformation such as affiliation data, funding networks and\ninstitutional networks might provide the necessary network\nedges that will allow the 'black-out' particle-swarm to remove more of the conflict of interest referees. One could also\nconceive of a situation in which the algorithm generates a set\nof potential referees which are then vetted by human operators on the basis of extraneous information to identify and\nexclude conflict of interest referees. In spite of its propensity\nto identify conflict of interest referees, such an application\nwould nevertheless greatly improve the referee identification\nprocess. This idea will be left to future research in this area.\nIt is important to further emphasize that this algorithm\nhas only been validated on a co-authorship network that is\nfocused on the computer sciences for which the digital library research agenda is a particular sub-domain. Different\nscientific disciplines will have different network topologies\n[15] and therefore may require different particle-swarm parameters. Therefore, conflict of interest situations may not\nbe so easily defined as those individuals 1 or 2 steps away in\nthe co-authorship network. We recommend that this algorithm, before being implemented within a specific community other than the digital library community, be validated\nusing the methodology described in this paper.\nThe Digital Library Research and Prototyping Team at\nthe Los Alamos National Laboratory is currently engineering\n\nthe a massive semantic scholarly network [3]. This network\nwill include relationships between authors, papers, journals,\nconferences, publishers, and institutions represented in a\nmulti-billion triple RDF triple store. Future work in the\narea will allow us identify which relationships are most important in not only making this algorithm more accurate at\nidentifying referees, but also conflict of interest situations.\nFor one, various parameters of the algorithm will be tested to\ndetermine the role of prolificness of an author and how they\neffect the particle-swarm energy distribution. As authors\nwrite more papers, their connectivity and thus, the probability of being encountered by a particle increases. It may\nbe important to understand how to adjust the algorithm to\naccount for such aspects of a reviewer. The network model\nof the scholarly community will also include temporal information and thus, referee research trends could be taken into\naccount to provide a mechanism of distinguishing between\nthose referees in bid category 1 and bid category 2. Furthermore, the semantic network substrate will allow us to test\nvarious 'semantically-aware' algorithms. For instance, the\ngrammar-based particle-swarm algorithm [16] can be used\nto direct the particles along a semantically meaningful path\nand thus will provide us with a wide-range of metrics for\nwhich to compare and contrast. We will be able to survey\nthe full landscape of network analysis algorithm such that we\nmay identify which algorithms and which semantics provide\nthe best mechanism for identifying peer-reviewers.\n\n5.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe peer-review process, in its present form, is mainly\nmediated by human efforts, i.e. authors, referees, and journal editors or conference organizers interact to produce a\nset of vetted, certified publications. This paper outlines an\nautomatic referee identification algorithm that requires no\nhuman intervention, is computationally efficient, and can,\nto some extent, automatically identify conflict of interest\nsituations. The referee weighting aspect of the algorithm\nprovides a strong incentive for its use in open commentary\npeer-review. The level of automation provides the necessary\ninfrastructure to decouple the publication process from the\npeer-review process in the sense that editors are no longer\nrequired to assign referees. A system that uses such an algorithm to identify and weight its reviewers is more efficient\nas well as more equitable and objective while at the same\ntime potentially allowing any member of the community contribute a review to a manuscript. Furthermore, a quantified\npeer-review service opens the peer-review process as an object of scientific inquiry.\nWe identify an inherent paradox associated with referee\nidentification. On the one hand, it is important to locate\nthe most qualified referees to review a manuscript, while on\nthe other, it is important to remove conflict of interest referees from the review process. The paradox lies in the fact that\nmany of the most qualified referees are necessarily conflict\nof interest referees. Therefore, an automated referee identification algorithm must achieve a balance between accepting\nqualified referees while at the same time rejecting conflict of\ninterest referees. It can only be concluded that the current\n'honor system' will continue to play an important role in\nthe peer-review process as no computer algorithm to date\ncan accurately identify the social and political elements of\nconflict of interest situations of peer-review.\n\n\f6.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis research could not have been conducted if it were\nnot for the support of the 2005 JCDL program chair and\nsteering committee.
