The nature of the tenuous disks around A stars has raised considerable controversy in the literature\nduring the past decade. The debate whether or not the disk around \u03b2 Pictoris contains gaseous molecular hydrogen\nis only the most recent example. Since CO is in general a poor tracer for the gas content of these low mass disks, we\ndiscuss here detailed emission line calculations for alternative tracers like C and C+ , based on recent optically thin\ndisk models by Kamp & van Zadelhoff (2001). The [C ii] 157.7 \u03bcm line was searched toward Vega and \u03b2 Pictoris\n- the most prominent A stars with disks - using ISO LWS data, and a tentative detection is reported toward\nthe latter object. From a comparison with emission line observations as well as absorption line studies of both\nstars, the gas-to-dust ratio is constrained to lie between 0.5 and 9 for \u03b2 Pictoris. For Vega the [C ii] observations\nindicate an upper limit of 0.2 M\u2295 for the disk gas mass. Predicted line intensities of C+ and C are presented for\na range of models and appear promising species to trace the gas content in the disks around A stars with future\ninstrumental capabilities (SOFIA, Herschel, APEX and ALMA). Searches for CO emission should focus on the\nJ=3\u20132 line.\nKey words. Stars: circumstellar matter \u2013 planetary systems: protoplanetary disks \u2013 Stars: early-type \u2013 Stars:\nindividual: \u03b2 Pictoris \u2013 Stars: individual: Vega\n\n1. Introduction\nA large number (20 \u2013 40 %) of nearby A stars is surrounded by dust disks (Cheng et al. 1992, Habing et al.\n2001), see for example \u03b2 Pictoris (20 Myr; Barrado y\nNavascu\u00e9s et al. 1999) or HR4796A (8 Myr; Stauffer et\nal. 1995). However, little is known about the nature of\nthese disks: are they dusty debris disks or do they still\nhave dust and gas and are possibly in a protoplanetary\nphase?\nThe disks around A stars have been extensively\nsearched for gas. CO rotational line observations revealed\ntoo little gas compared to the detected dust. Upper limits suggest that the gas mass in these disks can be up to\na factor of 1000 lower than deduced from the typical interstellar gas-to-dust ratio of 100 (Yamashita et al. 1993;\nSavoldini & Galletta 1994; Zuckerman et al. 1995; Dent et\nal. 1995; Liseau & Artymowicz 1998; Liseau 1999). This\nhas been interpreted that the gas dissipates very rapidly\nfrom such disks on timescales of a few million years.\nSend offprint requests to: Inga Kamp\n\u22c6\nBased on observations with ISO, an ESA project with instruments funded by ESA Member States (especially the PI\ncountries: France, Germany, The Netherlands and the United\nKingdom) and with the participation of ISAS and NASA.\nCorrespondence to: kamp@strw.leidenuniv.nl\n\nIn a previous paper, Kamp & Bertoldi (2000) showed\nthat in low mass optically thin circumstellar disks CO is\nlikely to be photo-dissociated either by the stellar or by the\ninterstellar ultraviolet (UV) radiation. If effective shielding prevents CO from being photo-dissociated, it is mainly\nfound in the form of CO ice mantles on the dust grains\nin the cool outer disk regions. This indicates that CO is\nactually a poor tracer of the gas and one should look for\nalternative tracers. A similar conclusion has been reached\nfor younger, more massive disks by Thi et al. (2001b).\nIn order to calculate the line emission from different\natoms and molecules in these disks a realistic modeling\nof the gas temperature is needed. With the low densities\nfound in these disks, gas and dust are not in collisional\nequilibrium; hence the gas and dust temperatures divert.\nThe computation of the gas temperature was performed\nby Kamp & van Zadelhoff (2001), including the relevant\nheating and cooling processes for the gaseous species.\nRecently, Thi et al. (2001) found hints of molecular hydrogen in the disk around \u03b2 Pictoris using the\nShort Wavelength Spectrometer (SWS) on board of the\nInfrared Space Observatory (ISO). They tentatively detected the S(0) and S(1) lines and deduced from the line\nratio an excitation temperature of \u223c100 K assuming LTE\n(ncr > 103 cm\u22123 ). The resulting H2 mass is \u223c54 M\u2295 with\nan uncertainty up to a factor of 3. On the other hand,\n\n\f2\n\nKamp et al.: Line emission from disks around A stars\n\nLecavelier des Etangs et al. (2001) failed to detect H2 line\nabsorption superposed on the broad O vi emission doublet at 1035 \u00c5 using the FUSE satellite. Most recently,\nOlofsson et al. (2001) observed extended emission in the\ngaseous Na i D lines using high resolution long-slit spectroscopy. The observed velocity pattern is consistent with\nresonance scattering arising in a disk in Keplerian rotation. The emission can be traced from less than 30 AU to\ndistances of at least 140 AU.\nThis short summary of the debate on \u03b2 Pictoris shows\ndefinitely the need to find suitable gas tracers, which can\nresolve the question whether the disks around young A\nstars are debris disks without any gas, or protoplanetary\ndisks in which gaseous planet formation may still proceed.\nThis paper concentrates on CO, C and C+ as possible gas tracers in these disks. Although H2 is contained\nin our chemical model, we abstain from a calculation of\nthe near infrared molecular lines, since it would involve a\ndetailed treatment of the ultraviolet pumping by stellar\nand interstellar photons which is beyond the scope of this\npaper. Moreover we do not calculate the Na emission from\nour models. Exploratory one-dimensional calculations indicate that in these disk models the Na i D pumping is not\noptically thin for the stellar radiation. Hence any radiative\ntransfer has to take into account not only the stellar radiation field, but also the local radiation field arising from\nthe Na atoms within the disk.\nIn the following sections we shortly summarize the basic properties of the optically thin disk models and describe the method used to derive the level populations\nand the line emission. We present results for a number\nof disk models with varying parameters and discuss them\nin the light of recent observations. In addition ISO LWS\nobservations of the [C ii] 157.7 \u03bcm line toward Vega and\n\u03b2 Pictoris are presented. At the end, suitable tracers to\ndetect the gas in disks around A stars are discussed, and\nline intensities are calculated for future instruments and\nfacilities.\n\n2. The disk models\nWe use here the models for low mass disks surrounding A stars with stellar spectra similar to \u03b2 Pictoris\nand Vega presented in an earlier paper (Kamp & van\nZadelhoff 2001). We shortly summarize the main features of the models and refer to the two previous papers,\nKamp & Bertoldi (2000; hereafter Paper i) and Kamp &\nvan Zadelhoff (2001; hereafter Paper ii), for further details.\n\n2.1. Basic physics of the models\nWe assume thin hydrostatic equilibrium models\nn(r, z) = ni (r/Ri )\u22122.5 e\u2212z\n\n2\n\n/2h2\n\n(1)\n\nwith a dimensionless scale-height H \u2261 h/r = 0.15. The\ninner and outer radius of the disk are fixed to Ri = 40 AU\nand Ro = 500 AU. The power-law exponent of the disk\n\nsurface density is \u22121.5, in reasonable agreement with the\nliterature values of brightness profiles (Hayashi et al. 1985;\nDutrey et al. 1996; Augereau et al. 2001) ranging from \u22121\nto \u22121.5.\nThe radiation field F\u03bd is composed of a stellar and\nan interstellar component. The stellar field is described\nby an ATLAS9 photospheric model (Kurucz 1992) for the\nappropriate stellar parameters, while the interstellar component is described by a Habing (1968) field with a flux of\nFH = 1.2\u00d7107 cm\u22122 s\u22121 from 912 \u00c5 to 1110 \u00c5 penetrating\nhomogeneously through the entire disk.\nThe dust temperature follows from radiative equilibrium assuming large spherical black body grains of size a\nTdust = 282.5 (L\u2217 /L\u2299 )\n\n1/5\n\n\u22122/5\n\n(r/AU)\n\n\u22121/5\n\n(a/\u03bcm)\n\n, (2)\n\nwith the stellar luminosity in units of the solar luminosity\nL\u2299 . The assumption of radiative equilibrium is correct\nfor the optically thin disks described in this paper. For\nhigher mass, optically thick disks, the dust-temperature\nwill depend on a detailed calculation of the transfer of\nphotons, including scattering, through the disk. Scattering\nwill in that case depend strongly on the dust-grain size.\nThe use of a grain size distribution would directly affect\nthe dust temperature and the shielding of UV radiation;\nthe latter is negligible for the tenuous disks discussed in\nthis paper. The dust temperature enters the chemistry\ne.g. via the formation of H2 and freezing out of CO and\ninfluences the gas temperature in some parts of the disk\nvia IR pumping of e.g. O i fine structure lines. Moreover\nthe photoelectric heating of the gas depends on the dust\ngrain size distribution. For the purposes of this work, the\ngrain size distribution is approximated by an effective dust\ngrain size, which represents the mean properties of the\ndust phase. Hence, in the following a single grain size of\n3 \u03bcm is assumed for all calculations.\nThe gas temperature and the chemical composition of\nthe circumstellar disk are derived by coupling the heating\nand cooling balance and the equilibrium chemistry. The\nmost relevant heating processes are: heating by infrared\nbackground photons, heating due to the drift velocity of\ndust grains, cosmic ray heating, photo-electric heating,\nand heating due to formation and photo-dissociation of\nH2 . Cooling, on the other hand, is dominated by [O i] and\n[C ii] fine-structure lines as well as the rotational lines of\nH2 and CO. The most uncertain process is the drift velocity heating: as grains are accelerated by the stellar radiation field and moving through the gas they loose part\nof their momentum. The final drift velocities reached by\nthe dust grains depend strongly on the rotation of the\ndisk - this cancels a certain fraction of gravity - and\non the amount of momentum transfer assumed. In order\nto bracket reality we obtained disk models for the two extreme cases: no drift velocity and a maximum drift velocity\n\nmax\nvdrift\n\n\u0014 \u0010\n\u0011\u00150.5\n\u00010.5\n1\n2\n2\n4\ncm s\u22121\n\u2212 vgas\nfrad + vgas\n=\n2\n\n(3)\n\n\fKamp et al.: Line emission from disks around A stars\n\nwhere vgas is the thermal velocity of the gas, and frad is\nthe radiation pressure on the grains.\nThe chemical network consists of 47 atomic, ionic, and\nmolecular species that are related through 260 gas-phase\nchemical and photoreactions. A number of reactions is\ntreated in more detail like H2 and CO photo-dissociation,\nand C ionization. The only surface reactions incorporated\nare H2 formation and freezing out of CO on cold dust-grain\nsurfaces. Since we are dealing with large dust particles, we\nreduced the H2 formation rate according to the reduced\ngrain surface area. The abundance of CO ice is due to a\nbalance between freezing out of gaseous CO and reevaporation of CO ice. A modified Newton-Raphson algorithm\nis used to obtain a stationary solution of the entire chemical network.\n\n2.2. Grid of A star disk models\nWe chose in Paper i and ii two very prominent representatives of the class of A stars with disks around them:\nVega and \u03b2 Pictoris. They differ mainly with respect to\nthe strength of their radiation field, with Vega, spectral\ntype A0V, having an integrated ultraviolet flux about\n6 000 times larger than the interstellar UV field at 40 AU,\nwhile the \u03b2 Pictoris UV field, spectral type A5V, is weaker\nthan the interstellar field outwards of 53 AU. At 40 AU it\nis about 1.8 times the Habing field. These two radiation\nfields roughly give the lower and upper limits for A stars.\nTable 1.

This is a valid assumption for disk\nmasses of 2 and 0.2 M\u2295 (see Paper i). Due to the high UV\n\n3\n\nflux of an A0V star the interstellar radiation field can be\nneglected for Vega.\nThe mass of the disk around \u03b2 Pictoris is 54 M\u2295 derived from the H2 S(0) and S(1) emission lines (Thi et\nal. 2001) and 44 M\u2295 from dust emission, assuming a constant gas-to-dust mass ratio of 100 (Chini et al. 1991). In\nthis paper only calculations for lower disk masses are performed, 0.2 and 2.0 M\u2295 , which bracket the observations\nfor \u03b2 Pictoris (upper limit for the CO emission lines and\nC i column densities from absorption lines). Our models\nrequire that the heating and cooling processes are optically\nthin. This prerequisite is not fulfilled in the M > 2.0 M\u2295\ndisk models since the [O i] cooling lines will become optically thick.\nIn order to show the effects of the inclusion of interstellar radiation as well as to give an overview of the temperature structure and chemical abundances in the models\npresented here, two cases are described in more detail. In\nFig. 1 two disks with a mass of 2.0 M\u2295 are shown irradiated by a star of spectral type A5V. The disk model\nwithout interstellar UV radiation field (right hand side of\nFig. 1) was presented in Paper II. The new model includes\nnow also the interstellar UV field (left hand side of Fig.\n1). For each model the temperature structure of the gas\nand dust are given as well as the densities of the molecular, atomic and ionic species at the midplane and at one\nscale height (h = 0.15r) of the disk. Both models are calculated under the assumption that vdrift = 0. To show the\neffects of the drift velocity on the gas and dust tempermax\natures, the corresponding models with vdrift = vdrift\nare\npresented as well. As the chemistry depends only weakly\non the temperature, at least in the temperature range covered in these models, the densities of each of the species\nare very similar with or without taking vdrift into account.\nIn the model without interstellar UV radiation field,\nhydrogen is mostly molecular and carbon is in the form of\nCO. As the dust temperature drops below 50 K, the critical value assumed in these models for CO molecules to\nfreeze out onto grain surfaces, CO ice becomes the dominant carbon bearing species. The abundances of C and\nC+ drop according to the freeze out of the gaseous CO.\nThe inner disk region has gas temperatures around 10 K\ndue to efficient CO rotational line cooling. Outwards of\n\u223c 200 AU, O i fine structure line cooling takes over, leading to slightly higher gas temperatures, Tgas \u223c 20 K. The\nmain heating processes are pumping of the O i fine structure levels by infrared background photons (inner part of\nthe disk) and cosmic ray heating. If we include drift velocity heating, it becomes the dominant heating mechanism\nand as the cooling processes remain the same, the equilibrium gas temperature is higher. Even though the chemistry hardly changes due to the higher gas temperature,\nthe excitation of atoms and molecules depends strongly on\nTgas . Therefore, detailed modeling of emission lines from\ncircumstellar disks has to be based on disk models with a\nrealistic determination of the gas temperature.\nThe main difference arising from the inclusion of an interstellar UV radiation field is the enhanced dissociation\n\n\fKamp et al.: Line emission from disks around A stars\n\n250\n200\n\n(a)\n\n100\n\n0\n\n40 K\n60 K 50 K\n100\n\n300\n400\nH r [AU] H2\n\n5\n\n500\n\n(b)\n\nC\n\n100\n\nH\n\n5\n\n300\nr [AU] H2\n\n20\n500\n\n400\n\n(c)\n\nCO ice\n\nCO\n\nC\n\n-10\n\n250\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\nr [AU]\n\n400\n\n180\n\nC+\n\n20\n500\n\n0\n\n60 K 50 K\n100\n\n200\n\n-5\n\n200\n150\n150\n100\n100\n50\n50\n00\n\n300\nr [AU]\n\n400\n\nC\n\nC+\n200\n\n300\nr [AU]\n\n100\n20\n500\n\n400\n\n(g)\n\nH2\n\nH\n\n0\n\n250\n200\n\n(d)\n\n40 K\n\n180\n\nCO\n\nCO ice\n\nCO\n\nCO ice\n\nC+\n\n500\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\nr [AU]\n\n340\n260\n\n340\n260\n\ne\u2212\n\n180\n\nC\n\n100\n\n-10\n\n[AU]\nTz gas\n[K]\n\nz [AU]\n\n50\n\n-5\n\n5\n\n200\n\n100\n\n(f)\n\ne\u2212\n\n100\n\n150\n\n500\n\nT [K]\n\n260\n\ne\u2212\n-5\n\n0\n\n100\n\n340\n\n0\n\n400\n\n-10\n\nT [K]\n\nlog n [cm-3]\n\n200\n\n0\n300\nr [AU]\nH2\n\nH\n\n100\n\n-10\n\n50\n\n60 K 50 K\n200\n\n100\n\nT [K]\n\nCO\n\n180\n\nC+\n\n40 K\n\n5\n\nT [K]\n\ne\u2212\nCO ice\n\n150\n\n100\n\n340\n260\n\n0\n-5\n\n200\n150\n150\n100\n100\n50\n50\n00\n\n200\n\nlog n [cm-3]\n\n50\n\nlog n [cm-3]\n\n[AU]\nTz gas\n[K]\n\n150\n\nlog n [cm-3]\n\nz [AU]\n\n200\n\n200\n\n(e)\nTgas [K]\n\n250\n\n20\n500\n\n400\n\n200\n\n(h)\n\n150\nTgas [K]\n\n4\n\n40 K\n\n50\n\n60 K 50 K\n100\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n300\nr [AU]\n\n400\n\n500\n\nFig. 1. Example of two of the modeled disks with 2 M\u2295 and stellar UV radiation appropriate for a \u03b2-Pictoris (A5V)\nstar. The panels (a)-(d) show a disk with interstellar UV field, the panels (e)-(h) the same disk without the interstellar\nUV radiation field. From top to bottom the panels represent: (a) and (e) the temperature of the gas (greyscale) and\nthe dust (white contour) for a disk with vdrift = 0; (b) and (f) the density of the different species at the midplane; (c)\nand (g) the density of the different species at 1 scale height (h = 0.15r); (d) and (h) temperature of the gas (greyscale)\nmax\nand the dust (white contour) when vdrift = vdrift\n. The adopted lines in (b), (c), (f) and (g) are: H: solid, H2 : dotted, C:\n+\ndashed, C : dash-dotted, CO: dash-dot-dotted, COice : dash-dot-dotted (thick), e-: long dashed, Tdust : dashed (thick)\nand Tgas : solid (thick).\nof H2 and CO and the enhanced ionisation of C. The CO\nice abundance (COice ) is only marginally affected. In the\ndisk with interstellar UV, CO is constantly formed and\ndissociated, but most of the CO freezes immediately out\nonto the grains. The COice is the sink for all C-bearing\nspecies at larger radii, except for the low density surface\nlayer, where hardly any CO freezes out. Since the initial\nratio of [O]/[C]> 1, O together with C+ and H2 are the\nmost important coolants available. Due to the enhanced\nUV flux, H2 dissociation and formation are the most important heating sources, leading to higher equilibrium gas\ntemperatures than in the previous case without the interstellar UV radiation field. As soon as C+ is lost as a\n\ncoolant because of its incorporation into CO ice, the gas\ntemperatures rise quickly to values in excess of 100 K.\nIncorporating the drift velocity into this model does not\nalter the gas temperature, because H2 dissociation and\nformation heating are more efficient than drift velocity\nheating.\nA complete list of all adopted models and performed\nradiative transfer calculations can be found in Table 1.\n\n3. Radiative transfer calculations\nFor the line radiative transfer the Monte Carlo code developed by Hogerheijde & van der Tak (2000) is used.\nThe disk models described in Sect. 2 are interpolated on\n\n\fKamp et al.: Line emission from disks around A stars\n\na cylindrical grid (26 \u00d7 10 grid cells), with a logarithmic radial grid in order to smoothly follow the density\nand temperature gradients. The size of the grid is small\ndue to computational constraints. A comparison run with\ntwice the number of grid cells gave a less than 20% difference in integrated line-intensity, comparable to the observational errors. The calculations concentrate on the non\nlocal-thermal-equilibrium (NLTE) intensities of the fine\nstructure lines of C and C+ and the rotational transitions\nof CO. Table 2 shows the respective line data and beam\nsizes used for convolution in the section on comparison to\nobservations (Sec. 6).

The\nabundances of the trace species under consideration as\nwell as their most important collision partners are taken\nfrom our stationary disk models (Paper ii and Fig. 1).\nThe code allows the use of two different collision partners and Table 3 shows the most important partners for\neach species and the respective references for the collisional rate coefficients. Stimulated absorption and emission by far-infrared radiation from dust is not significant\nfor these species. For C\u2013H2 and C+ \u2013H2 collisions, we assume that the ortho-to-para ratio of molecular hydrogen\nis determined by the local gas temperature. In the case of\nC+ , scaled H2 collision cross sections for atomic hydrogen\nare used; hence the total density of the collision partner\nis given by the weighted sum of the H2 and H density,\nnamely n(H2 ) + n(H)/0.57, and n(e) is considered as the\nsecond partner. Comparing CO\u2013H and CO\u2013e\u2212 collision\ncross sections, it is found that for n(H)/n(e\u2212 ) < 103 , collisions with electrons are more important than collisions\nwith neutral hydrogen. In the case of all A0V models and\nthe A5V models with interstellar radiation, n(H) is the\nmain collision partner for CO; in the remaining models\n\nnot enough H2 is dissociated and collisions with electrons\ndominate over atomic hydrogen collisions.\nThe resulting populations at each position in the disk\nare used to compute the sub-millimeter line profiles of\nCO, C, and C+ using a ray tracing program which calculates the sky brightness distribution. Observations of\ncircumstellar ultraviolet absorption lines of CO and C\naround \u03b2 Pictoris reveal a line-broadening parameter b =\n1.3 km s\u22121 (Roberge et al. 2000). This value is used for\nall model calculations.\n\n4. Results\nAs a first result the line profiles are calculated for a beam\nwith the same size as the apparent diameter of the disk on\nthe sky. The beam is centered on the stars and has a size\nof 50.5 \u2032\u2032 for simulating \u03b2 Pictoris and 128.9 \u2032\u2032 for Vega at\ntheir appropriate distances, 19.82 and 7.76 parsec, respectively. The adopted inclinations are taken from \u03b2 Pictoris\n(edge on) and Vega (face on).\nSince the emission lines are optically thin, the integrated intensities can be converted directly to any inclination. These results can therefore be used for any disk\naround\nan A star as long as the total integrated flux\nR\nTmb dv \u00d7 \u03a9mb is kept constant. In the following the presentation of the results is separated into two sections. The\nfirst deals with A5V and the second with A0V stars.\n\n4.1. Spectral type A5V\nWe choose atomic carbon as an example to illustrate the\neffects of the various model parameters on the resulting\nline profiles (Fig. 2). The shapes of the emission-line profiles show a double peaked structure, with subtle differences due to excitation and/or abundances (e.g., Figs. 2f\nand 3b).\nFor the 2M\u2295 model including the interstellar UV radiation field (Fig. 2c,d), the gas temperature rises above\n50 K resulting in a 3 P2 \u20133 P1 /3 P1 \u20133 P0 ratio of approximately unity. The carbon density rises by an order of\nmagnitude compared to the other 2M\u2295 models, because\n\n\fKamp et al.: Line emission from disks around A stars\n\n1.0\n\n(a)\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n10\n(c)\n\n5\n\n-10 -5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n10\n(d)\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n-10 -5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n1.4\n\n10\n(e)\n\n-10 -5\n\n0.7\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n-10 -5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n1.4\n\n10\n\n0\n\n5\n\n1.4\n\n0.7\n\n10\n\n0.7\n0.0\n10\n\nFig. 2.

There is no difference in\ngas temperature between the calculation with or without\ndrift velocity heating, as the temperature balance is in this\ncase entirely determined by H2 formation and dissociation\n(Fig. 1).\nFor the cases with only the stellar radiation field, the\ndifference between the 2 M\u2295 models with (Fig. 2e) and\nwithout (Fig. 2f) drift velocity is due to the gas temperature. Tgas drops below 20 K (Fig. 1) for a large part of the\ndisk without any drift velocity heating, keeping most of\nthe carbon in the ground state. Hence the lines are significantly weaker than with drift velocity heating included.\nIn the case where Tgas = Tdust (Fig. 2g), the 3 P2 \u2013\n3\nP1 line is stronger than the 3 P1 \u20133 P0 line contrary to the\nother 2 M\u2295 models (Figs. 2e, f) which include heating and\n\n(a)\n\n10\n\n2\n\n(b)\n\n1\n0\n-10 -5\n\n(f)\n\n-10 -5 0 5\nv [km/s]\n\n20\n\n0\n\n10\n\n(g)\n\n-10 -5 0 5\nv [km/s]\n\ncooling.

The temperature stays above 40 K in the inner 100 AU of the disk,\ngiving rise to equally strong emission lines. This is not the\ncase if the drift-velocity heating is absent. In that case the\ntemperature drops below 30 K causing the 3 P2 \u20133 P1 line\nto become much weaker and the 3 P1 \u20133 P0 slightly higher.\nFor C+ and CO we concentrate on four models, the\n2 and 0.2 M\u2295 model with interstellar UV radiation and\nmax\nmax\nvdrift = vdrift\n, and the 2 M\u2295 models with vdrift = vdrift\nand\nvdrift = 0 without interstellar radiation. The combination\nof these models shows all the possible influences in the\nmodels. Comparisons between panels (a) and (c) show the\ninfluence of the interstellar UV radiation field, between (a)\nand (b) of the disk mass, and between (c) and (d) of the\ndrift-velocity heating on the emission lines of C+ and CO.\nThe influence of the interstellar radiation field on the\ntemperature and chemical abundances can be seen in\nFig. 1. The CO abundance is reduced due to enhanced\nphotodissociation, and the C+ line therefore becomes\nmuch stronger. Moreover, the lower CO transitions J=1\u2013\n0 and J=2\u20131 are generally weaker than the J=3\u20132 line.\nThis is due to typical gas temperatures in excess of 30 K\n(the J=3 level lies at 33 K) due to the interstellar radiation field.

This has only\na marginal effect on the three lowest levels of CO for the\n2.0 M\u2295 model. Only in the surface layers of the disk are\nthe densities low enough to prevent collisionally excitation of J=3. These slight differences are therefore only\nmarginally visible in the line-profiles and not distinguishable with current telescope facilities.\nThe influence of the drift-velocity on the line emission\nis large in the case without interstellar UV radiation. Due\nto the extremely low gas-temperatures in the inner regions\nof the disk, where the CO density is highest, the J=1 level\nis excited more efficiently than the higher levels, making\nthe lowest transition the strongest (Fig. 4d).\nIn the case of the lower mass (0.2 M\u2295 ) disk, the level\npopulations do show clear NLTE effects on the level populations, even close to the midplane. The total emission,\nhowever, is extremely small. Whereas the C and C+ line\nemission scale roughly with mass, the CO line emission is\nreduced by nearly three orders of magnitude due to enhanced dissociation in the lower mass disk.\n\nenhancing the C+ abundance and its emission by a few\norders of magnitude.\nSimilar to the A5V stars, we illustrate the differences\narising from the various models by using C as an example. The models with drift-velocity heating are generally\nwarmer than those without. This is nicely illustrated in\nFig. 5, where the 3 P2 \u20133 P1 /3 P1 \u20133 P0 line ratio is higher\nmax\n. The temperature effect\nfor the models with vdrift = vdrift\nis more pronounced in the 0.2 M\u2295 model, as the ratio is\nlarger than unity. For the vdrift = 0 models, the cooling is\nmore efficient in the low-mass disk giving a relatively large\n3\nP1 \u20133 P0 line emission compared to the higher transition.\nIn the low mass models, the ionization fraction is much\nhigher due to a general lack of shielding. This leads to C\nemission that is a factor of 100 lower than in the 2 M\u2295\nmodels.\nFor C+ the differences are entirely due to the excitation. The C+ densities scale with the mass, but the population of the upper level (91.2 K) depends strongly on the\ngas temperature. For CO, the J=3\u20132 line is the strongest\nmax\nrotational transition in the models with vdrift = vdrift\nand\nroughly equal to the 2\u20131 line in the other two models.\n\n4.2. Spectral type A0V\nSince we adopted the disks around A0V stars to be seen\nface on, no coherent velocities are seen in the line of sight\nand only the micro-turbulent (b = 0.91 km s\u22121 ) and thermal velocities remain.\nAll line profiles show a single gaussian emission peak,\nand are generally orders of magnitude weaker for C and\nCO than in the A5V models. Due to the high UV flux\nfrom the A0V stars, most of the CO in the gas phase\nis dissociated. The atomic carbon is subsequently ionized\n\n4.3. Integrated intensities\nThe line profiles presented in the above sections are calculated for a single position using different beam-sizes.\nTherefore they do not reveal in which part of the disk the\nemission arises, nor at which position the beam should be\ncentered to pick up the maximum emission from the disk.\nTo illustrate the radial dependence of the emission, the\ndisk is scanned with a small beam over the disk midplane,\n\n\fKamp et al.: Line emission from disks around A stars\n\nTmb [mK]\n\n8\n\n20\n10\n0\n-4\n\nTmb [mK]\n\n2\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n1\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n20\n\n0\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n60\n\n(c)\n\n10\n\n4\n(d)\n\n30\nx0.1\n\n0\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n2\nv [km/s]\n\n4\n\n0\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n2\nv [km/s]\n\n4\n\nTmb [mK]\n\nFig. 6.

[C ii] observations of Vega and \u03b2 Pictoris\nThe Infrared Space Observatoty (ISO) data archive was\nused to retrieve all observations made with the Long\nWavelength Spetrometer (LWS) in a radius of 15\u2032 toward Vega and \u03b2 Pictoris. This yielded data from projects\nby MBARLOW and RSTARK taken in full grating scan\nmode (AOT L01) and grating range scan mode (LWS\nAOT L02). The spectral sampling interval of all data from\nthese projects is 1/4 of a resolution element. The number\nof grating scans (forward and backward) varied between 6\nand 24. Each scan yields simultaneous data accross ten detectors. The total integration time varied between 1172 s\nand 3592 s per AOT. We only considered the data from\ndetector LW04 whose central wavelength is at \u223c 160\u03bcm\n(grating in nominal position). The effective beam size of\nthis detector is 78\u2032\u2032 (FWHM), the spectral resolution is\nabout 0.6 \u03bcm which corresponds to a velocity resolution\nof about 1150 km s\u22121 at 157.7 \u03bcm (ISO Handbook Vol.\nIV; Version 1.2).\nThe data were automatically processed through the\nLWS pipeline (OLP version 10), yielding LWS Auto analysis (LSAN) files which contain the flux and wavelength\ncalibrated spectrum of an AOT. The absolute flux calibration is estimated at about 30% (Swinyard et al. 1996). The\nwavelength accuracy for the LW detectors is \u223c 0.15 \u03bcm\n(ISO Handbook Vol. IV; Version 1.2). Final data reduction was done manually using the ISO spectral Analysis\nPackage (ISAP) Version 2.1. Glitches and their related\ndecays due to Cosmic Rays were removed from each individual grating scan. A medium clip was subsequenly applied to all scans for all data in a bin which is more than\n2.5 \u03c3 larger or smaller than the median. Since the observed\nsources are not bright nor larger than the LWS beam, no\ndefringing was applied. Subsequently an average to the\nmean of all subscans was done for each bin. A linear baseline was fitted to the averaged spectrum and the line fluxes\nwere estimated through fitting of a gaussian profile with\na FWHM comparable to the instrumental resolution.\nThe resulting spectra are presented in Fig. 10. The\nspectrum toward Vega does not reveal any spectral line,\na 2 \u03c3 upper limit to the [C ii] line intensity was estimated\nat < 1.6 \u00d7 10\u221220 W cm\u22122 \u03bcm\u22121 in a 0.15 \u03bcm bin. The\nline-of-sight toward \u03b2 Pictoris shows a 4 \u03c3 feature with a\nmaximum intensity of 1.8 \u00d7 10\u221220 W cm\u22122 \u03bcm\u22121 and an\nintegrated intensity of about 1\u00d710\u221220 W cm\u22122 centred at\n157.85 \u03bcm, which agrees with the wavelength of the [C ii]\nline within the LWS accuracy. The off-spectrum does not\nreveal any emission at this frequency with a 2 \u03c3 upper\nlimit of 1.0 \u00d7 10\u221220 W cm\u22122 \u03bcm\u22121 in a 0.25 \u03bcm bin which\nindicates that there is no contamination by an extended\ninterstellar [C ii] emission component. However, a contribution of weak interstellar [C ii] cannot be fully excluded\nsince the integration time used for the OFF position is a\nfactor 2.5 lower than used toward \u03b2 Pictoris.\n\nFig. 10. ISO LWS spectra of the [C ii] 157.7 \u03bcm line\nfor \u03b2 Pictoris (ON 05h47m17.11s -51d03'59.5\" and OFF\n05h47m22.66s -50d57'28.5\", J2000).\n\n6. Comparison of models with observations\nThe attempts to detect the gas component in low mass\ndisks around A stars concentrate mostly on prominent A\nstars like \u03b2 Pictoris and Vega. In order to compare the\nmodels to the observations, we have chosen the same beam\nsizes as used in the different observations. Table 2 shows\nthe beam sizes for each line and telescope, while Fig. 11\nillustrates the areas of the disk contained in the different\nbeams for \u03b2 Pictoris (edge-on at a distance of 19.8 pc) and\nVega (pole-on at a distance of 7.8 pc). For Vega a radial\noffset of 14.7 \u2032\u2032 (114 AU) is applied because the smallest\nbeams contain only the star and the inner hole of the\ndisk model. Observations by Holland et al. (1998) and\nsubsequent modeling by Dent et al. (2000) substantiate\nthe presence of these holes.\n\n6.1. \u03b2-Pictoris\nFor \u03b2 Pictoris, the CO J=1\u20130 and 2\u20131 lines have\nbeen searched several times with the SEST (Savoldini &\nGalletta 1994; Liseau & Artymowicz 1998) and the JCMT\n(Dent et al. 1995). In all cases only an upper limit on\nthe CO column density was derived, the most strict being\nNCO < 3 1014 cm\u22122 so far. This is deduced from the CO\n2\u20131 upper limit found by Liseau & Artymowicz (1998),\nwhere they obtain a noise level of Trms = 11 mK using\na binning of 0.9 km s\u22121 .

The beam sizes in the lower\npanel correspond to those in the top panel.\n\nwhich corresponds to the halfwidth of the CO line, the\nnoise level goes down to 4 mK. To compare these limits\nto the models, Trms has to be converted using the main\nbeam efficiency \u03b7mb = 0.38 of the SEST at the corresponding wavelength. The models presented show that the\nJ=2\u20131 transition in the \u03b2 Pictoris model with 2 M\u2295 and\nthe interstellar radiation field reaches a flux of 12.2 mK\nwith a binning of 5 km s\u22121 , while the J=1\u20130 line reaches\nonly 0.9 mK (Fig. 12a). At the typical disk temperatures\nof 50 K in the models, mostly the J=2 and J=3 levels\nare populated. The predicted J=2\u20131 line would not have\nbeen detected by the latest SEST observations, which have\nTmb,rms = Trms /\u03b7mb = 10.5 mK.\nThe models show that in fact the most favorable line\nto observe is the J=3\u20132 line. A spectrum for this line,\ntaken from the JCMT public archive, has a noise level of\nTrms = 27 mK after smoothing to 1.1 km s\u22121 velocity\nbins. A much deeper integration should be possible with\nthe dual polarization B3 receiver. The current limit is a\n\nThe 2 M\u2295 disk models have significantly lower mass\nthan the value of \u223c 50M\u2295 inferred from the dust using\na gas/dust ratio of 100:1. Scaling the mass up by that\nfactor (\u00d725), both the J=2\u20131 and J=3\u20132 line should have\nbeen easily detected even though the CO gas abundance\nis unlikely to scale linearly due to enhanced freeze-out.\nComparison between Figs. 12c and d reveals that without drift velocity heating the disk becomes much cooler\nand the lines weaker. Even the line ratios are affected, in\nthe sense that the J=2\u20131 and J=3\u20132 lines are now equally\nstrong. Moreover, the 0.2 M\u2295 model gives CO lines below\n0.1 mK, indicating that the threshold for CO detection\noccurs between 0.2 and 4 M\u2295 (see Fig 12b, assuming that\nCO scales linearly in a narrow range of disk mass) for the\ndistance and inclination of \u03b2-Pictoris. Roughly a factor\nof 10 in flux is generally gained compared to the averaged intensity from the entire disk (Fig. 4). A comparison\nof Fig. 4d and Fig. 12d reveals that the smaller beams\npick up mostly the warm CO in the inner disk regions.\nIn addition the difference in beam dilution is largest for\nthe J=2\u20131 and J=3\u20132 lines compared to the entire disk\nbeam.\nOn the other hand, there are UV absorption-line studies along the line of sight towards \u03b2 Pictoris. Roberge et\nal. (2000) observed C i and CO using the HST STIS highresolution echelle spectrograph. Contrary to previously detected C i absorption (Jolly et al. 1998), an unsaturated\nspin-forbidden transition was observed. This allowed for\n\n\fKamp et al.: Line emission from disks around A stars\n\nIn the 2 M\u2295 disk models, the CO column density\nis 8 1015 cm\u22122 , roughly 10 times higher than the observed value. The C i column density from the model,\n\u223c 1 1017 cm\u22122 , is also a factor 2.5\u20135 higher than observed\nin the absorption studies. In case of the 0.2 M\u2295 disk models a CO and C i column density of 8 1012 and 5 1015 cm\u22122\nis reached respectively. Both are lower than the observed\nvalues, leading to the conclusion that the actual mass lies\nin between these models.\nThe detected [C II] line provides a reliable estimate of\nthe amount of ionized gas in the disk around \u03b2-Pictoris.\nThe emission line was modeled adopting the ISO beam of\n78 \u2032\u2032 . The integrated emission for the 2 and 0.2 M\u2295 disk\nmodels is 1.9 \u00d7 10\u221221 and 2.6 \u00d7 10\u221222 W cm\u22122 respectively. Both are lower than the observed value of 1 \u00d7 10\u221220\nW cm\u22122 . At first sight, this would indicate that according\nto the model more gas is present in the disk around \u03b2Pictoris. However, this conclusion depends heavily on the\nassumed UV radiation and further modeling is needed.\nFreudling et al. (1995) derived from the non-detection\nof the H i 21 cm line an upper limit of 2 \u2212 5 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122\nfor the neutral hydrogen column density. The column calculated for the 2 M\u2295 disk model including the interstellar\nfield is 8 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 and for the 0.2 M\u2295 disk model\n8 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 , a few times higher than observed.\nThe H i column density in the 2M\u2295 model is close to\nN (H) = 5 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 deduced by Olofsson et al. (2001)\nfrom their sodium observations using a solar Na/H abundance ratio. In the models described here, the available\nH i in the gas is directly related to the amount of H2 selfshielding of the stellar radiation. The interstellar radiation\nfield penetrating through the disk is not shielded by H2 ,\nhence comparable columns of H2 and H i are reached (see\npaper I). A disk with a 25 times higher mass would be\nable to shield the midplane of the disk and the H i column\nwill decrease. This process would hardly affect the carbon\nspecies in the outer regions, because CO will freeze out, incorporating all the available carbon. In the inner regions,\nthe C i and CO densities would increase in a higher mass\ndisk and the column densities would be too high compared\nwith observations.\nOur models show that a \u03b2-Pictoris disk with 2 M\u2295 of\ngas might have escaped detection in CO. The absorption\nstudies towards \u03b2 Pictoris show that the models give CO\nand C i column densities that are up to a factor of 10 too\nhigh. In case of the 0.2 M\u2295 models all of these upper limits\nare met as C+ and COice become the main reservoirs of\ncarbon. In the case of the H i absorption even the low mass\n0.2 M\u2295 disk overestimates the observed upper limit. Since\nthe estimate by Olofsson et al. (2001) differs by a factor of\n10 and the true H2 formation rate used is not known, not\ntoo much weight should be given to the H i constraint.\n\nTmb [K]\n\n2\n\n4\n\n(a)\n\n1\n\n(b)\n\n2\n\nx107\n\nx106\n0\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2\nTmb [K]\n\nan improved determination of the ground state C(3 P) column of (2\u20134) 1016 cm\u22122 .

Note that the fluxes are muliplied by\nthe factors indicated.\n\n6.2. Vega\nFor Vega, there are in general less observations than for\n\u03b2 Pictoris. Due to the pole-on geometry, absorption line\nstudies for Vega are impossible. Yamashita et al. (1993)\nsearched for the CO J=1\u20130 line with the 45 m Nobayama\nRadio Observatory (NRO). They detected no CO emission\ndown to a Trms of 33 mK in 1 km s\u22121 bins. Even with the\nbetter sensitivity of Trms \u223c 10 mK of the JCMT, Dent et\nal. (1995) did not detect any CO J=2\u20131 around Vega.\nThe above calculations show that a 2 M\u2295 model for Vega\nreaches at most 1 mK for the J=3\u20132 transition (Fig. 13c).\nThe lowest J=1\u20130 transition has fluxes below 0.1 mK.\nThis is entirely due to photodissociation. Simple scaling\nsuggests that the lines will still not be detectable with\ncurrent instruments if the disk mass is enlarged by a factor\nof 20.\nThe difference seen in comparing the models with and\nwithout drift-velocity heating (Fig. 13a-d) is entirely due\nto differences in gas temperature. Drift-velocity heating\nis the most important heating source of the gas and, if\nomitted, H2 formation/dissociation as well as photoelectric heating of the \u03bcm-size dust particles remain, leading\nto lower gas temperatures. The CO fluxes are a factor of\n10 higher than with the beam of 128.9 \u2032\u2032 corresponding to\nthe entire disk (compare Fig. 7 and 13). This is due to\nthe low CO densities in the outer regions picked up in\nthe large beam. The sometimes different line ratios can be\nexplained by the restricted area picked up by the smaller\ntelescope beams.\nThe models for the Vega disk predict [C ii] integrated\nemission lines of 1.910\u221220 and 7.910\u221222 W cm\u22122 for the 2\nand 0.2 M\u2295 disks. The former integrated intensity corre-\n\n\f12\n\nKamp et al.: Line emission from disks around A stars\n\nsponds to a peak intensity of 3.4 \u00d7 10\u221220 W cm\u22122 \u03bcm\u22121\nand the latter to 1.4 \u00d7 10\u221221 W cm\u22122 \u03bcm\u22121 . The ISO\nsatellite observed Vega in the wavelength range of the [C ii]\n157.74 \u03bcm line (Sect. 5) and obtained an upper limit of\n1.6 \u00d7 10\u221221 W cm\u22122 \u03bcm\u22121 . This would suggest a maximum amount of gas of \u223c 0.2 M\u2295 in the disk around Vega.\n\n7.

APEX is located\nat 5000 m at Chajnantor in Chili and is perfectly placed\nto observe \u03b2-Pictoris. For Vega, the [C i] emission line is\ncalculated using the JCMT telescope instead of APEX.\nAdditionally [C i] and [C ii] lines for the future instrumentation on board of SOFIA and Herschel are calculated.\nThe velocity resolution of all the telescopes is set at 1 km\ns\u22121 to detect the line profiles except for the [C i] 809.3 GHz\n(370 \u03bcm) line, where 5 km s\u22121 is used.\n\n300 mK, whereas the 2 M\u2295 Vega model yields only 15 mK.\nSince the source is at a low zenith angle, the current\n370 \u03bcm receiver at the JCMT would require 200 minutes of observing time for a 5 km s\u22121 velocity resolution\nto reach a 3 \u03c3 detection for a 300 mK peak intensity of\nthe line. This is clearly not feasible. The expected upgraded receiver at APEX would reach this limit in about\n20 minutes for \u03b2-Pictoris. A higher spectral resolution of\n1 km s\u22121 would increase the time to about 8 hours.\nThe lowest [C i] line at 492.2 GHz (609.13 \u03bcm) is calculated using the JCMT specifications. A typical noise\nlevel of TA\u2217 =40 mK in 1 km s\u22121 bin could be reached\nin 1.1 hours of integration time at an elevation of 60\u25e6 ,\nappropriate for the \u03b2-Pictoris disk from the APEX site.\nThe predicted Tmb = 100 mK line should be detectable\nwith this configuration. For a star like Vega with a strong\nUV radiation field, this line is not observable in low mass\n(\u2264 2 M\u2295 ) disks.\nFor the HIFI instrument on board of the Herschel satellite, the [C i] line at 609.13 \u03bcm is at the lower limit of Band\n1, while the 370.42 \u03bcm line falls in Band 3. The sensitivity estimates for a long integration (5 hours) are 2 and\n3 mK respectively (de Graauw & Helmich 2001). Since\nthe Herschel beam is much larger than the JCMT beam,\nnearby edge-on disks will suffer from large beam dilution.\nStill, both the edge-on \u03b2-Pictoris disk and the pole-on disk\naround Vega should be just observable in both lines.\n\n(d)\n\n20\n\n20\n10\n0\n\n0\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n2\nv [km/s]\n\n4\n\n0\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n2\nv [km/s]\n\n4\n\nFig. 14.

In general, APEX, due to its\nexcellent site and stable atmosphere has better sensitivities.\nThe [C i] 370.42 \u03bcm intensity of the 2 M\u2295 disk model\nwith interstellar UV field for \u03b2 Pictoris yields a flux of\n\n(a)\n\n80\n\n(b)\n\n40\nx0.1\n-10 -5 0 5\nv [km/s]\n\n10\n\n0\n-4\n\nx0.1\n-2\n\n0\n2\nv [km/s]\n\n4\n\nFig. 15.

Note that the fluxes are\nmuliplied by the factors indicated.\nThe [C ii] fine structure line at 157.74 \u03bcm can be observed in Band 6 of the HIFI instrument on board of\nHerschel. In a long exposure (5 hours), a sensitivity of\n\u223c6 mK is reached (de Graauw & Helmich 2001). A 2 M\u2295\nmodel will be observable in both Vega and \u03b2-Pictoris.\nIf the slightly larger beam of SOFIA is used, 16 \u2032\u2032 compared to the 11 \u2032\u2032 of Herschel, the model fluxes for the [C ii]\nline decrease by about a factor 2 for an edge-on disk model\ndue to additional beam dilution. Since we applied an offset\nof 15 \u2032\u2032 to the pole-on disk model, there is hardly any difference between the two beam sizes for this model. In both\ncases, the beam is entirely filled by the disk model. Apart\nfrom the difference in beam size, HIFI and the GREAT in-\n\n\fKamp et al.: Line emission from disks around A stars\n\nstrument on SOFIA will have comparable sensitivity limits and integration times.\nThe Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) will\nreach a sensitivity and angular resolution which will be\norders of magnitude larger than the current status. In the\ncase of Vega and \u03b2 Pictoris, angular resolution is of minor\nimportance due to the relatively small stellar distances.\nAdopting the expected sensitivities, an hour of integration\non the CO 3\u20132 line with a spectral resolution of 0.5 km s\u22121\nwould give a 5 \u03c3 detection of 0.05 K. This result is obtained\nfor the compact configuration with baselines up to 150 m,\nwhich gives a spatial resolution of 2 \u2032\u2032 . Figure 8 shows that\nthe integrated line intensity of the CO 3\u20132 line peaks at\na 2 \u2032\u2032 offset for \u03b2-Pictoris. Using a spectral resolution of\n0.5 km s\u22121 the local emission at 2 \u2032\u2032 offset reaches 2.1 K.\nAt the wavelength of the [C i] 3 P1 \u22123 P0 transition the 5 \u03c3\nlevel reached with ALMA is expected to be twice as high\n(0.1 K). The modeled intensity for this line peaks at 1.2 K.\nIn both cases the CO and [C i] line should be detectable\nin a few seconds and half a minute respectively. For Vega\nthe detection limits are more stringent and peak intensities (with a 2 \u2032\u2032 beam) will be 0.05 for the [C i] line and\n6 \u00d7 10\u22124 K for the CO line. [C i] will thus be detectable\nin 4 hours integration time and CO is undetectable (7000\nhrs) for this binsize at a 5 \u03c3 level.\n\n8. Discussion and conclusion\nThe optically thin models described in this paper provide\na tool to constrain the gas mass in circumstellar disks on\nthe basis of observed emission lines and derived column\ndensities. Due to the complex interplay between chemistry, temperature, shielding, and radiative transfer in the\nemitting lines, it cannot be exluded that more massive\noptically thick disk models yield similar column densities\nand line emission, but this is left for future modeling.\nAssuming that CO emission scales linearly over a small\nrange of disk mass, the comparison with observations of\nCO and [C I] made for \u03b2 Pictoris constrains the gas mass\nbetween 0.2 and 4 M\u2295 . The question remains: do the results indeed lead to the conclusion that the \u03b2 Pictoris disk\nis depleted in gas, or is there still some physical input missing in the models?\nEvidence that our models are still not complete comes\nfrom the recent observations of Lecavelier des Etangs et\nal. (2001) and Deleuil et al. (2001), who have shown that\n\u03b2 Pictoris might be an active star. The detection of the\nO vi emission doublet at 1035 \u00c5 and of C ii and C iii\nlines with the FUSE satellite, lead to the conclusion that\n\u03b2 Pictoris may have a chromosphere. Even though the observed O vi lines do not overlap with any of the CO photodissociation lines, the continuum of the chromosphere\nincreases the stellar UV flux and hence the amount of CO\nphotodissociation. H2 will be less affected due to its more\nefficient self-shielding. The existence of a chromosphere\nin \u03b2 Pictoris would increase the photodissociation rate for\nCO as well as the ionization rate for carbon, hence leading\nto lower CO and C i column densities.\n\n13\n\nFUSE is not sensitive enough to detect the continuum\nflux shortward of 1100 \u00c5 in \u03b2 Pictoris. This makes it difficult to estimate the strength of the additional chromospheric UV radiation field. Nevertheless, the upper limit\nfor a continuum given by the FUSE spectra (at 1000 \u00c5\n\u223c 3.2 \u00d7 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 Hz\u22121 ), could still hide a chromosphere of about 10 times higher than the photospheric\nflux included so far in the models. Section 4 shows that the\ninclusion of an interstellar UV radiation field decreases the\nCO emission already by a factor of 20 (compare Fig. 12a\nand c). Hence the presence of a chromosphere in the star\n\u03b2 Pictoris, which can be according to the FUSE data up\nto a factor 10 in units of the interstellar radiation field,\nmay allow larger disk masses to be consistent with the current CO J=2\u20131 and 3\u20132 observational limits. Moreover it\ncan enlarge the [C ii] 157.74 \u03bcm line significantly and thus\nbring it closer to the observed integrated intensity.\nHeap et al. (2000) report the detection of an inner warp\nin the disk around \u03b2 Pictoris. From STIS coronographic\nobservations, they deduce a two component disk model: a\nmain outer disk and a fainter inner disk, which is inclined\nby 4-5\u25e6 with respect to the main disk and extends to about\n80 AU. Hence, the inclined inner disk will receive more\nstellar UV radiation, leading to less CO, C i and more\nC ii. In the case of an inner warp, the UV absorption-line\nstudies would miss some of the inner disk material and underestimate the total disk mass. Both effects allow larger\ndisk masses to be consistent with the present observations.\nSo we are left with the final question: do the dusty\ndisks seen around A stars (\"Vega-type\" stars) still contain\ngas? The previously drawn conclusion that these disks are\ndebris disks which contain less gas than dust, is mainly\nbased on CO conversion factors appropriate for molecular\nclouds. But the low mass disks around A-type stars resemble more a photodissociation region than a molecular\ncloud. From the models presented here and the discussion\nof the various observations for \u03b2 Pictoris, it is difficult to\nkeep the gas-to-dust ratio as high as 100. On the basis of\nthe present models, we argue for a gas-to-dust ratio between 0.5 and 9 for \u03b2 Pictoris, assuming a dust mass of\n0.44 M\u2295 (Chini et al. 1991). This ratio depends of course\non the dust mass and on the basis of different modeling approaches Dent et al. (2000) found a dust mass of 0.04 M\u2295 ,\nwhile Li & Greenberg (1998) obtained 0.33 M\u2295 . Any chromosphere included in the models will - depending on\nits strength - raise the gas-to-dust value. Moreover, the\n2 M\u2295 model with the interstellar radiation field suggests\nthat the inclusion of a chromospheric UV radiation field\ncan solve the remaining problem with CO, C i, and C ii\nsimultaneously. This shows the power of using observations of several species to constrain the gas mass instead\nof using only one, namely CO.\nFor Vega, the non-detection of CO gave an upper limit\nfor the gas mass of 7 \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u2295 using a CO abundance\nof \u223c 10\u22124 (Yamashita et al. 1993). Our models show, that\nCO is entirely photodissociated in Vega and hence this\nupper limit has to be regarded with caution. Following the\nmodels presented in this paper, most of the carbon is in\n\n\f14\n\nKamp et al.: Line emission from disks around A stars\n\nform of C+ . Hence, we use [C ii] observations to constrain\nthe gas mass in the disk around Vega and obtain an upper\nlimit of 0.2 M\u2295 . This gives and upper limit of 33 for the\ngas-to-dust ratio, assuming a dust mass of 6 \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u2295\n(Chini et al. 1990) and 80 assuming a dust mass of 2.5 \u00d7\n10\u22123 M\u2295 (Dent et al. 2000).\nIn order to improve our understanding of these disks\nand to constrain the gas mass, more suitable gas tracers\nthan CO are needed. While absorption studies only probe\nthe disk material in the line of sight, emission line studies\ncontain information on the disk structure as a whole and\nare therefore better suited to constrain the disk models.\nThe calculations presented in this paper for a 2 M\u2295 disk\nwith a gas-to-dust mass ratio of 100 show that the best\ntracers among those considered here (CO, C, and C+ ) are\nC+ and C. This result does not depend on the geometry\nof a nearby disk, because the beams of APEX, SOFIA\nand Herschel are small. Moreover the conclusion holds for\ndisks around A stars with a moderate radiation field like\n\u03b2 Pictoris as well as for disks that are exposed to a larger\nUV flux like around Vega.\nAcknowledgements.
