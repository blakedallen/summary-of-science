SHAPIRO\nThe University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign\n\nAbstract\nThere is compelling evidence that supermassive black holes exist. Yet the origin of these objects, or their seeds, is still unknown. We discuss several plausible scenarios for forming the\nseeds of supermassive black holes. These include the catastrophic collapse of supermassive\nstars, the collapse of relativistic clusters of collisionless particles or stars, the gravothermal evolution of dense clusters of ordinary stars or stellar-mass compact objects, and the\ngravothermal evolution of self-interacting dark matter halos. Einstein's equations of general\nrelativity are required to describe key facets of these scenarios, and large-scale numerical\nsimulations are performed to solve them.\n\n1.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThere is substantial evidence that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of mass \u223c\n106 \u2212 1010 M\u2299 exist and are the engines that power active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and quasars\n(Rees 1998, 2001; Macchetto 1999). There is also ample evidence that SMBHs reside at the\ncenters of many, and perhaps most, galaxies (Richstone et al. 1998; Ho 1999), including the\nMilky Way (Genzel et al. 1997; Ghez et al. 2000; Sch\u00f6del et al. 2002).\nSince quasars have been discovered out to redshift z & 6 (Fan et al. 2000, 2001), the\nfirst SMBHs must have formed by zBH & 6, or within tBH . 109 yrs after the Big Bang.\nHowever, the cosmological origin of SMBHs is not known. This issue remains one of the\ncrucial, unresolved components of structure formation in the early universe. Gravitationally,\nblack holes are strong-field objects whose properties are governed by Einstein's theory of\nrelativistic gravitation - general relativity. General relativistic simulations of gravitational\ncollapse to black holes therefore may help reveal how, when and where SMBHs, or their\nseeds, form in the universe. Simulating plausible paths by which the first seed black holes\nmay have arisen is the underlying motivation of our investigation (see Fig. 1.1).\n\n1.2\n\nThe Boltzmann Equation\n\nVarious routes have been proposed over the years by which SMBHs or their seeds\nmight arise by conventional physical processes (see, e.g., Fig. 1 in Rees 1984). Some\nroutes are hydrodynamical in nature, such as the formation and collapse of supermassive\nstars (SMSs), while others are stellar dynamical, like the evolution and collapse of colli1\n\n\fS. L. Shapiro\n\nFig. 1.1. The formation of a black hole is a strong-field gravitational phenomenon\nin curved spacetime that requires Einstein's equations of general relativity for a\ndescription and, in nontrivial cases, numerical simulations for a solution.\nsionless clusters. The Boltzmann equation provides a common mathematical framework for\ncomparing competing scenarios:\n\u0012 \u0013\nDf\n\u2202f\n.\n(1.1)\n=\nDt\n\u2202t collisions\nIn equation (1.1) f is the phase-space distribution function for the matter, which might be\nin the form of a gaseous fluid, collisionless particles, and/or stars. The left-hand side of\nthe equation represents the total time derivative of f following a matter element along its\ntrajectory in phase space. The right-hand side describes the role of collisions in modifying\nthe phase-space distribution along the trajectory. To treat different scenarios the Boltzmann\nequation must be solved in different physical regimes, all of which share gravitation as the\nthe dominant long-range interaction.\nTable 1.1 summarizes some of the SMBH formation simulations that we have performed\nin recent years. Typically, every scenario falls into one of three distinct regimes. In the\nVlasov (collisionless Boltzmann) regime the dynamical timescale of the system, td , which\nis the time for matter to cross from one side of the system to the other, as well as the time to\nachieve virial equilibrium by violent relaxation, is much shorter than the relaxation timescale\ntr , the time for the system to reach thermal equilibrium via collisions. In pure Vlasov simulations the integration time t may exceed td but always remains much shorter than tr . In\nsuch cases collisions can be ignored. The system can be evolved to dynamical (virial) equilibrium, but not thermal equilibrium. In the secularly collisional regime, td again is much\nshorter than tr but the integration time is now much longer than tr . Here collisions are crucial in driving the quasi-stationary evolution of the virialized system. Since the timescale for\ncollisions remains much longer than the dynamical timescale, collisions can often be handled perturbatively by tracking the secular drift of the system from one, nearly collisionless,\n2\n\n\fS. L. Shapiro\nvirialized state to the next. This is the approach adopted in the Fokker-Planck approximation\nto the Boltzmann equation. In the collision-dominated regime, tr is much shorter than td and\nthe system behaves as a fluid. This regime embraces all of hydrodynamics.\nTable 1.1 Boltzmann simulations of SMBH formation scenarios\nREGIME\n\nVlasov\n(Collisionless)\n\nFokker-Planck\n(Secularly Collisional)\n\nFluid\n(Collision Dominated)\n\nTIME SCALE\nORDERING\n\ntr >> t >> td\n\nt >> tr >> td\n\nt >> td >> tr\n\nSCENARIOS\n\ndynamical\ncollapse of\na relativistic\ncluster of\n(1) compact stars\n(NSs or\nstellar-mass BHs)\nor\n(2) collisionless\nparticles\n\n\"gravothermal\ncatastrophe\"\ndrives core\ncontraction of\n(1) a dense cluster\nof compact stars;\nor\n(2) a dense cluster\nof ordinary stars;\nor\n(3) an SIDM halo\n\nhydrodynamical\ncollapse\nof an SMS\n\nGRAVITATION\n\nGR\n\nNewtonian\n\nGR, PN\u2217\n\nSPATIAL\nSYMMETRY\n\nSpherical;\nAxisymmetrical\n\nSpherical\n\nSpherical;\nAxisymmetrical;\nArbitrary\u2217\n\nCOMPUTATIONAL\nDIMENSIONS\n\n1 + 1;\n2+1\n\n1+1\n\n1 + 1;\n2 + 1;\n3 + 1\u2217\n\nCOMPUTATIONAL\nTECHNIQUE\n\nparticle simulation\n(matter)\n+\nfinite-differencing\n(field)\n\nfinite-differencing\n\nfinite-differencing\n\nScenarios considered to date for forming SMBHs, or their seeds, in the Vlasov regime\nfocus on the dynamical collapse of a radially unstable, relativistic cluster of compact stars\n(neutrons stars or stellar-mass black holes) or collisionless particles. Scenarios in the secularly collisional regime typically involve the gravothermal contraction of a dense cluster of\nordinary stars or compact stars which undergo collisions and mergers, leading to a build-up\nof massive black holes. The gravothermal contraction of a self-interacting dark matter halo\n(SIDM) in the early universe may also produce a SMBH. Hydrodynamical scenarios typically focus on the collapse of a SMS or gas cloud. Not surprisingly, simulations performed\nin the different regimes require very different computational approaches. Table 1 indicates\nthat the different scenarios have been tackled by adopting various degrees of spatial symmetry to simplify the calculations. A summary of the results of these simulations is given in\nthe sections below.\n\n1.3\n\nNumerical Relativity\n\nNumerical relativity - the art and science of developing computer algorithms to\nsolve Einstein's field equations of general relativity - is the principal tool needed to sim3\n\n\fS. L. Shapiro\nulate plausible black hole formation processes. The underlying equations are multidimensional, highly nonlinear, coupled partial differential equations in space and time. They have\nin common with other areas of computational physics, like fluid dynamics and MHD, all of\nthe usual problems associated with solving such nontrivial equations. However, solving Einstein's equations poses some additional complications that are unique to general relativity.\nThe first complication concerns the choice of coordinates. In general relativity, coordinates\nare merely labels that distinguish points in spacetime; by themselves coordinate intervals\nhave no physical significance. To use coordinate intervals to determine physically measurable (proper) distances and times requires the spacetime metric, but the metric is determined\nonly after Einstein's equations have been solved. Moreover, as the integrations proceed, it\noften turns out that the original (arbitrary) choice of coordinates turns out to be bad, because,\nfor example, singularities eventually are encountered in the equations. The gauge freedom\ninherent in general relativity - the ability to choose coordinates in an arbitrary way - is\nnot always easy to exploit successfully in a numerical routine.\nThe appearance of black holes always poses a complication in a numerical relativity simulation. Black holes inevitably contain spacetime singularities - regions where the gravitational tidal field, the matter density, and the spacetime curvature all become infinite. Encountering such singularities results in some of the terms in Einstein's equations becoming\ninfinite, causing overflows in the computer output and premature termination of the numerical integration. Thus, when dealing with black holes, it is crucial to choose a technique\nwhich avoids the spacetime singularities inside. Some of the techniques involve choosing\nappropriate coordinate gauges that avoid or postpone the appearance of singularities inside\nblack holes. Others involve excising the black hole interiors altogether from the numerical\ngrid.\nOne of the main goals of a numerical relativity simulation is to determine the gravitational\nradiation generated from a dynamical scenario. However, the gravitational wave components\nusually constitute small fractions of the background spacetime metric. Moreover, to extract\nthe waves from the background requires that one probe the spacetime in the far-field or radiation zone, which is typically at large distance from the strong-field central source. Yet it is\nthe strong-field, near-zone region that usually consumes most the computational resources\n(e.g., spatial grid) to guarantee accuracy. Furthermore, waiting for the wave to propagate to\nthe far-field region usually takes nonnegligible integration time. Overcoming these difficulties to reliably measure the wave content thus requires that a code successfully cope with the\nproblem of dynamic range inherent in such a simulation.\nFor a recent review of the status of numerical relativity, and a summary of the key equations, see Baumgarte & Shapiro (2003) and references therein.\n\n1.4\n\nCollapse of a Rotating SMS to a SMBH\n\nSMBHs must be present by zBH & 6 to power quasars. It has been suggested\n(Gnedin 2001) that even if they grew by accretion from smaller seeds, SMBH seeds &\n105 M\u2299 must have formed at z \u2248 9 to have had sufficient time to build up to a typical mass\nof \u223c 109 M\u2299 . A likely progenitor is a very massive object (e.g., an SMS) supported by\nradiation pressure.\nSMSs (103 . M/M\u2299 . 1013 ) may form when contracting or colliding primordial gas\nbuilds up sufficient radiation pressure to inhibit fragmentation and prevent star formation\n(see, e.g., Bromm & Loeb 2003). SMSs supported by radiation pressure will evolve in a\n4\n\n\fS. L. Shapiro\nquasi-stationary manner to the point of onset of dynamical collapse due to general relativity\n(Chandrasekhar 1964a,b; Feynmann, unpublished, as quoted in Fowler 1964). Unstable\nSMSs with M & 105 M\u2299 and metallicity Z . 0.005 do not disrupt due to thermonuclear\nexplosions during collapse (Fuller, Woosley, & Weaver 1986). In fact, recent Newtonian\nsimulations suggest that evolved zero-metallicity (Pop III) stars & 300 M\u2299 do not disrupt\nbut collapse with negligible mass loss (Fryer, Woosley, & Heger 2001). This finding could\nbe important since the first generation of stars may form in the range 102 \u2212 103 M\u2299 (Bromm,\nCoppi, & Larson 1999; Abel, Bryan, & Norman 2000). A combination of turbulent viscosity\nand magnetic fields likely will keep a spinning SMS in uniform rotation (Bisnovatyi-Kogan,\nZel'dovich, & Novikov 1967; Wagoner 1969; Zel'dovich & Novikov 1971; Shapiro 2000;\nbut see New & Shapiro 2001 for an alternative). As they cool and contract, uniformly\nrotating SMSs reach the maximally rotating mass-shedding limit and subsequently evolve\nin a quasi-stationary manner along a mass-shedding sequence until reaching the instability\npoint. At mass-shedding, the matter at the equator moves in a circular geodesic with a\nvelocity equal to the local Kepler velocity (Baumgarte & Shapiro 1999).\nIt is straightforward to understand the radial instability induced by general relativity in\na SMS by using an energy variational principle (Zel'dovich & Novikov 1971; Shapiro &\nTeukolsky 1983). Let E = E(\u03c1c ) be the total energy of a momentarily static, spherical fluid\nconfiguration characterized by central mass density \u03c1c . The condition that E(\u03c1c ) be an extremum for variations that keep the total rest mass and specific entropy distribution fixed is\nequivalent to the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium and establishes the relation between\nthe equilibrium mass and central density:\n\u2202E\n= 0 =\u21d2 Meq = Meq (\u03c1c )\n\u2202\u03c1c\n\n(equilibrium).\n\n(1.2)\n\nThe condition that the second variation of E(\u03c1c ) be zero is the criterion for the onset of\ndynamical instability. This criterion shows that the turning point on a curve of equilibrium\nmass vs. central density marks the transition from stability to instability:\n\u2202Meq\n\u22022E\n= 0 \u21d0\u21d2\n=0\n\u2202\u03c1c 2\n\u2202\u03c1c\n\n(onset of instability).\n\n(1.3)\n\nConsider the simplest case of a spherical Newtonian SMS supported solely by radiation\npressure and endowed with zero rotation. This is an n = 3, (\u0393 = 1 + 1/n = 4/3) polytrope,\nwith pressure\n4\n1\nP = Prad = aT 4 = K\u03c1 3 ,\n3\n\n(1.4)\n\nwhere K = K(srad ) is a constant determined by the value of the (constant) specific entropy\nsrad = 34 aT 3 /n in the star. Here T is the temperature, n is the baryon number density, and a is\nthe radiation constant. Consider a sequence of configurations with the same specific entropy\nbut different values of central density. The total energy of each configuration is\nE(\u03c1c ) = Urad + W,\n\n(1.5)\n\nwhere Urad is the total internal radiation energy and W is the gravitational potential energy.\nApplying the equilibrium condition (1.2) to this functional yields Meq = Meq (srad ), i.e. the\nequilibrium mass depends only on the specific entropy and is independent of central density\n5\n\n\fS. L. Shapiro\n\nFig. 1.2. A sketch of mass versus central density along an equilibrium sequence of\nSMSs of fixed entropy. Panel (a) shows nonrotating, spherical Newtonian models\nsupported by pure radiation pressure; (b) shows nonrotating, spherical PN models\nsupported by radiation pressure plus thermal gas pressure; (c) shows rotating PPN\nmodels spinning at the mass-shedding limit.\n(see Fig. 1.2a). Applying the stability condition (1.3) then shows that all equilibrium models\nalong this sequence are marginally stable to collapse.\nNow let us account for the effects of general relativity. If we include the small (destabilizing) Post-Newtonian (PN) correction to the gravitational field, we must also include\na comparable (stabilizing) correction to the equation of state arising from thermal gas pressure:\n1\nP = Prad + Pgas = aT 4 + 2nkT,\n(1.6)\n3\nwhere we have taken the gas to be pure ionized hydrogen. Note that Pgas/Prad = 8/(srad /k) \u226a\n1. The energy functional of a star now becomes\nE(\u03c1c ) = Urad + W + \u2206Ugas + \u2206WPN ,\n\n(1.7)\n\nwhere \u2206Ugas is the internal energy perturbation due to thermal gas energy and \u2206WPN is\nthe PN perturbation to the gravitational potential energy. Applying the equilibrium condiNewt\ntion (1.2) now yields Meq \u2248 Meq\ntimes a slowly varying function of \u03c1c (see Fig. 1.2b). The\nturning point on the equilibrium curve marks the onset of radial instability; the marginally\nstable critical configuration is characterized by\n\u03c1c,crit\n\n=\n\nTc,crit\n\n=\n\n(R/M)crit\n\n=\n\n\u22127/2\n\n2 \u00d7 10\u22123M6\n\ngm cm\u22123 ,\n\n(3 \u00d7 10 )M6\u22121 K,\n1/2\n1.6 \u00d7 103M6 ,\n7\n\n(1.8)\n\nwhere M6 denotes the mass in units of 106 M\u2299 . (Here and throughout we adopt gravitational\nunits and set G = 1 = c.)\nFinally, let us consider a uniformly rotating SMS spinning at the mass-shedding limit\n(Baumgarte & Shapiro 1999). A centrally condensed object like an n = 3 polytrope can\nonly support a small amount of rotation before matter flys off at the equator. At the massshedding limit, the ratio of rotational kinetic to gravitational potential energy is only T /|W | =\n0.899 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u226a 1. Most of the mass resides in a nearly spherical interior core, while the lowmass (Roche) envelope bulges out in the equator: Req /Rpole = 3/2. When we include the\n6\n\n\fS. L. Shapiro\ncontribution of rotational kinetic energy to the energy functional, we must now also include\nthe effects of relativistic gravity to Post-Post-Newtonian (i.e. PPN) order, since both T and\n\u2206WPN scale with \u03c1c to the same power. The energy functional becomes\nE(\u03c1c ) = Urad + W + \u2206Ugas + \u2206WPN + \u2206WPPN + T\n\n(1.9)\n\nApplying the equilibrium condition (1.2), holding M, angular momentum J and s fixed, now\nNewt\nyields Meq \u2248 Meq\ntimes a slowly varying function of \u03c1c (see Fig. 1.2c). If we restrict\nour attention to rapidly rotating stars with M > 105 M\u2299 the influence of thermal gas pressure is unimportant in determining the critical point of instability. The turning point on the\nequilibrium curve then shifts to higher density and compaction than the critical values for\nnonrotating stars, reflecting the stabilizing role of rotation:\n\u03c1c,crit\n\n=\n\n0.9 \u00d7 10\u22121M6\u22122 gm cm\u22123 ,\n\nTc,crit\n\n=\n\n(9 \u00d7 107)M6\n\n(Rpole /M)crit\n\n=\n\n427,\n\n(J/M 2 )crit\n\n=\n\n0.97.\n\n\u22121/2\n\nK,\n\n(1.10)\n\nThe actual values quoted above for the critical configuration were determined by a careful numerical integration of the general relativistic equilibrium equations for rotating stars\n(Baumgarte & Shapiro 1999); they are in close agreement with those determined analytically\nby the variational treatment. The numbers found for the nondimensional critical compaction\nand angular momentum are quite interesting. First, they are universal ratios that are independent of the mass of the SMS. This means that a single relativistic simulation will suffice\nto track the collapse of a marginally unstable, maximally rotating SMS of arbitrary mass.\nSecond, the large value of the critical radius shows that a marginally unstable configuration\nis nearly Newtonian at the onset of collapse. Third, the fact that the angular momentum\nparameter of the critical configuration J/M 2 is below unity suggests that, in principle, the\nentire mass and angular momentum of the configuration could collapse to a rotating black\nhole without violating the Kerr limit for black hole spin (but see below!).\nThere are several plausible outcomes that one might envision a priori for the dynamical collapse of a uniformly rotating SMS once it reaches the marginally unstable critical\npoint identified above. It could collapse to a clumpy, nearly axisymmetric disk, similar to\nthe one arising in the Newtonian SPH simulation of Loeb & Rasio (1994) for the isothermal (\u0393 = 1) implosion of an initially homogeneous, uniformly rotating, low-entropy cloud.\nAlternatively, the disk might develop a large-scale, nonaxisymmetric bar. After all, the onset of a dynamically unstable bar mode in a spinning equilibrium star occurs when the ratio\nT /|W | \u2248 0.27 (see, e.g., Chandrasekhar 1969 and Lai, Rasio, & Shapiro 1993 for Newtonian\ntreatments and Saijo et al. 2001 and Shibata, Baumgarte, & Shapiro 2000a for simulations\nin general relativity). Since T /|W | is 0.899 \u00d7 10\u22122 at the onset of collapse and scales roughly\nas R\u22121 during collapse due to conservation of mass and angular momentum, this ratio climbs\nabove the dynamical bar instability threshold when the SMS collapses to R/M \u2248 20, well\nbefore the horizon is reached. The growth of a bar might begin at this point. Indeed, a weak\nbar forms in simulations of rotating supernova core collapse (Rampp, M\u00fcller, & Ruffert\n1998; Brown 2001), but here the equation of state stiffens (\u0393 > 4/3) at the end of the collapse, triggering a bounce and thereby allowing more time for the bar to develop. A rapidly\nrotating unstable SMS might not form a disk at all, but instead collapse entirely to a Kerr\n7\n\n\fS. L. Shapiro\n\nFig. 1.3. Snapshots of density and velocity profiles during the implosion of a\nmarginally unstable SMS of arbitrary mass M rotating uniformly at break-up speed\nat t = 0. The contours are drawn for \u03c1/\u03c1max = 10\u22120.4 j ( j = 0 \u2212 15), where \u03c1max denotes the maximum density at each time. The fourth figure is the magnification of\nthe third one in the central region: the thick solid curve at r \u2248 0.3M denotes the\nlocation of the apparent horizon of the emerging SMBH. (From Shibata & Shapiro\n2002.)\n\nblack hole; not surprisingly, a nonrotating spherical SMS has been shown to collapse to a\nSchwarzschild black hole (Shapiro & Teukolsky 1979). Alternatively, the unstable rotating\nSMS might collapse to a rotating black hole and an ambient disk.\nTwo recent simulations have resolved the fate of a marginally unstable, maximally rotating SMS of arbitrary mass M. Saijo et al. (2002) followed the collapse in full 3D, assuming\nPN theory. They tracked the implosion up to the point at which the central spacetime metric begins to deviate appreciably from flat space at the stellar center. They found that the\nmassive core collapses homologously during the Newtonian epoch of collapse, and that axisymmetry is preserved up to the termination of the integrations. This calculation motivated\nShibata & Shapiro (2002) to follow the collapse in full general relativity by assuming axisymmetry from the beginning (see Fig. 1.3). They found that the final object is a Kerr-like\nblack hole surrounded by a disk of orbiting gaseous debris. The final black hole mass and\nspin were determined to be Mh /M \u2248 0.9 and Jh /Mh2 \u2248 0.75. The remaining mass goes into\nthe disk of mass Mdisk /M \u2248 0.1. A disk forms even though the total spin of the progenitor\n8\n\n\fS. L. Shapiro\nstar is safely below the Kerr limit. This outcome results from the fact that the dense inner\ncore collapses homologously to form a central black hole, while the diffuse outer envelope\navoids capture because of its high angular momentum. Specifically, in the outermost shells,\nthe angular momentum per unit mass j, which is strictly conserved on cylinders, exceeds\njISCO , the specific angular momentum at the innermost stable circular orbit about the final\nhole. This fact suggests how the final black hole and disk parameters can be calculated\nanalytically from the initial SMS density and angular momentum distribution (Shapiro &\nShibata 2002). The result applies to the collapse of any marginally unstable n = 3 polytrope\nat mass-shedding. Maximally rotating stars which are characterized by stiffer equations of\nstate and smaller n (higher \u0393) do not form disks, typically, since they are more compact and\nless centrally condensed at the onset of collapse (Shibata, Baumgarte, & Shapiro 2000b).\nThe above calculations show that a SMBH formed from the collapse of a maximally\nrotating SMS is always born with a \"ready-made\" accretion disk. This disk might provide\na convenient source of fuel to power the central engine. The calculations also show that\nthe SMBH will be born rapidly rotating. This fact is intriguing in light of suggestions that\nobserved SMBHs rotate rapidly (e.g., Wilms et al. 2001; Elvis, Risaliti, & Zamorani 2002).\n\n1.5\n\nCollapse of Collisionless Matter to a SMBH\n\nZel'dovich & Podurets (1965) speculated that sufficiently compact, relativistic clusters of collisionless particles (e.g., relativistic star clusters) would be unstable to gravitational\ncollapse. It has taken considerable theoretical effort to prove that this speculation is correct.\nFor a given distribution function f = f (E), one can construct a sequence of spherical equilibrium clusters parametrized by the gravitational redshift at the cluster center, zc . One can then\nplot a curve of fractional binding energy Eb /M0 = 1 \u2212 M/M0. vs. zc along the sequence. Linear perturbation theory, implemented via a variational principle and trial functions, shows\nthat the onset of radial instability occurs near the first turning point on such a binding energy\ncurve (Ipser & Thorne 1968; Ipser 1969; Fackerell 1970). A rigorous theorem has been\nproven that spherical equilibrium configurations are stable, at least up to the first turning\npoint on the binding energy curve (Ipser 1980). Numerical simulations have shown that all\nspherical configurations beyond the first turning point are dynamically unstable (Shapiro &\nTeukolsky 1985a,b,c; 1986). Most significantly, these simulations have tracked the nonlinear evolution of unstable spherical and axisymmetric clusters, including those with rotation\n(Abrahams et al. 1994; Shapiro, Teukolsky, & Winicour 1996), and have determined their\nfinal fate (see Fig. 1.4). This computational enterprise (\"relativistic stellar dynamics on a\ncomputer;\" see Shapiro & Teukolsky 1992 for a review and references) has demonstrated\nthe following:\n(1) the dynamical collapse of a collisionless cluster leads to the formation of a Kerr\n\nblack hole whenever J/M 2 . 1;\n(2) collapse leads instead to a bounce followed by virialization of the cluster by relativistic violent relaxation whenever J/M 2 & 1;\n(3) in extreme core-halo systems, collapse leads to a new stationary, equilibrium system consisting of a central black hole surrounded by an extensive, nearly Newtonian halo containing most of the mass.\nConclusion (3) is very tantalizing as a plausible route for forming SMBHs (see Fig. 1.5\nand 1.6). But a key question remains: under what circumstances can a cluster be driven to a\ndynamically unstable, relativistic state to trigger such a collapse?\n9\n\n\fS. L. Shapiro\n\nFig. 1.4. The collapse of a marginally unstable gas of collisionless particles of arbitrary mass M which at t = 0 obeys a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution function\nwith an areal radius R/M = 9.0. Spherical flashes of light are used to probe the\nspacetime geometry; at late times the light rays are trapped by the gravitational\nfield. Their trajectories help locate the black hole event horizon, which in this example eventually reaches rs /M = 2 and encompasses all the matter. (After Shapiro\n& Teukolsky 1988.)\n\nOne possibility may involve the \"gravothermal catastrophe,\" the runaway core contraction on a relaxation timescale of a stable, virialized cluster due to the perturbative influence\nof collisions (Chandrasekhar 1942; Lynden-Bell & Wood 1968; see Spitzer 1975, 1987 and\nLightman & Shapiro 1978 for reviews and references). Collisional scattering is a source\nof kinetic energy transport (heat conduction). Self-gravitating, nearly collisionless clusters\nwith td /tr \u226a 1 have negative heat capacity: as their high-temperature cores lose energy to\ntheir low-temperature halos by heat conduction, the cores contract and, in accord with the\nvirial theorem, become hotter still, leading to a thermal runaway. The result is that the clusters undergo homologous core contraction (Lynden-Bell & Eggleton 1980), as depicted in\nFigure 1.7 for Newtonian clusters composed of identical particles. Contraction to a singular\nstate is complete in a time \u2248 300tr (0), where the central relaxation timescale tr (0) is measured from an arbitrary initial time t = 0 (Cohn 1979). Specifically, as t \u2192 300tr (0), the\ncentral density as well as the the central redshift, potential and velocity dispersion (temperature) all blow up: \u03c1c \u2192 \u221e and zc \u223c \u03a6c \u223c \u03c5c2 \u2192 \u221e. At the same time the core radius and mass\nboth shrink: rc \u2192 0 and Mc \u2192 0. The required number of relaxation timescales to reach this\nsingular state, as well as the r\u22122.2 fall-off in the halo density profile, are nearly independent\nof the velocity dependence of the collision cross section (Balberg & Shapiro, unpublished).\n10\n\n\fS.

The left panel shows the initial\nequilibrium rest-mass density profile. The points label the interior rest-mass fraction. This cluster has a highly relativistic core and an extensive Newtonian halo and\nis marginally unstable to collapse. The right panel is a spacetime diagram showing\nthe worldlines of imaginary Lagrangian matter tracers. The dashed line shows the\nevent horizon of the black hole that forms at the center. Note that the central core\nand its surroundings undergo collapse but that 95% of the cluster mass settles into\nstable dynamical equilibrium about the central hole. (From Shapiro & Teukolsky\n1986.)\nThis gravothermal catastrophe can, in principle, drive a core to a highly relativistic state, at\nwhich point it could become dynamically unstable to catastrophic collapse on a dynamical\ntimescale.\nDetailed numerical calculations have been performed for several scenarios to test whether\nthe gravothermal catastrophe can trigger the formation of SMBHs. We will summarize three\nof them below.\n1.5.1\n\nGravothermal evolution of a cluster of compact stars\nHere we describe simulations involving the evolution of clusters of compact stars\n(neutron stars or stellar-mass black holes) and the build-up of massive black holes. This\nroute has been discussed by several authors (e.g., Zel'dovich & Podurets 1965; Rees 1984;\nShapiro & Teukolsky 1985c; Quinlan & Shapiro 1987, 1989). We briefly summarize below\nthe key results of the multi-mass Fokker-Planck calculations of Quinlan & Shapiro (1989).\nConsider a dense cluster of compact stars composed initially of identical neutron stars\nor black holes of mass m\u2217 = 1.4 M\u2299 in virial equilibrium. Take the central mass density\nto be \u03c1c \u2248 108 M\u2299 pc\u22123 and the central velocity dispersion to be \u03c5c \u2248 500 km s\u22121 . Here\ngravothermal evolution is driven by the cumulative effect of repeated, distant, small-angle,\ngravitational (Coulomb) scatterings between the stars. Binary formation is significant and is\ndominated by dissipative, 2-body capture by gravitational radiation.\nThe simulations reveal that mass segregation causes significant departures from singlecomponent homological evolution models. For example, \u03c5c does not increase at the center\n11\n\n\fS. L. Shapiro\n\nFig. 1.6. Snapshots of the central particle distribution inside rs /M = 2 at selected\ntimes during the collapse described in Figure 1.5. The cluster does not evolve\nappreciably after t/M = 40. The circle in the last frame shows the black hole event\nhorizon at rs /M = 0.1. (From Shapiro & Teukolsky 1986.)\n\nand the cluster is not driven to a relativistic state. However, there is an inevitable build-up of\nmassive BHs via successive binary mergers. The evolution is followed up to the formation\nof BHs of mass MBH & 100 M\u2299 , at which point the number of stars in the core become\nsufficiently small that the Fokker-Planck treatment breaks down. The intermediate mass\nBH binaries produced in this scenario would be prime sources of gravitational waves for\nthe ground-based network of laser interferometers now under construction (LIGO, VIRGO,\nGEO, and TAMA) and for the space-based interferometer currently being designed (LISA).\n1.5.2\n\nGravothermal evolution of a dense cluster of ordinary stars\nHere we discuss simulations that start from more typical initial conditions. These\ncalculations treat the gravothermal evolution of a dense cluster of ordinary, main-sequence\nstars (Spitzer & Saslaw 1966; Colgate 1967; Sanders 1970; Begelman & Rees 1978; Lee\n1987; Quinlan & Shapiro 1990; Gao et al. 1991; Portegies Zwart & McMillan 2002).\nHere we briefly summarize the multi-mass Fokker-Planck calculations of Quinlan & Shapiro\n(1990), which are among the most detailed for galactic nuclei that do not assume the presence of a SMBH a priori.\n12\n\n\fS.

Snapshots of the self-similar density profile at selected times during secular core collapse of a nearly collisionless Newtonian cluster (the gravothermal\ncatastrophe). The thick line shows the profile at t = 0 and successive profiles with\nhigher central densities correspond to later times. (From Balberg, Shapiro, & Inagaki 2002.)\nConsider a dense galactic nucleus initially consisting of main-sequence stars with mass\nm\u2217 = 1.0 M\u2299 in virial equilibrium. Take the central mass density to be in the range \u03c1c \u2248 106 \u2212\n108 M\u2299 pc\u22123 and the central velocity dispersion to be in the range \u03c5c \u2248 100 \u2212 400 km s\u22121 .\nThis velocity is below the escape velocity from the surface of the stars, so that collisions\nwill lead to mergers and not disruptions. Collisions and mergers, stellar evolution and the\nformation of new stars from gas liberated by supernovae are included in the calculation, as\nare the formation of binaries by 3-body encounters and the interaction between hard binaries\nand single stars. All of this activity takes place in the context of the gravothermal evolution\nof the cluster, which again is driven by the cumulative effect of repeated, distant, smallangle, gravitational scattering of the stars.\nThe outcome of the evolution is that stars with m\u2217 & 100 M\u2299 form easily, then merge\nand collapse to form seed BHs with masses MBH \u2248 100 \u2212 1000 M\u2299 in a time t . 1010 yrs.\nThe end result is the formation of a dense cluster of compact remnants comprised of intermediate mass black holes. The cluster is characterized by frequent binary mergers (\u226b 1 per\nyear when integrated throughout the visible universe of \u223c 1010 galaxies). These intermediate mass black hole binaries are again promising sources of gravitational waves for the\nground-based laser interferometers like LIGO and for the proposed space-based interferometer LISA.\n1.5.3\n\nGravothermal contraction of an SIDM halo to a relativistic state\nDark matter comprises about 90% of the matter in the universe. The simplest description of dark matter which accounts for many features of the large-scale structure of\nthe universe is the \"cold dark matter\" (CDM) model, in which the dark matter particles are\nessentially collisionless.

Snapshots of the (a) density and (b) velocity dispersion profiles of an\nSIDM halo at selected times during gravothermal evolution. The thick line shows\nthe profile at t = 0 and successive profiles with higher central densities correspond\nto later times. Bifurcation into a fluid inner core and a collisionless outer core is\nevident at late times. (From Balberg et al. 2002.)\n\neach other strongly and have a substantial scattering cross section has been revived recently\n(Spergel & Steinhardt 2000) to explain several observations of dark matter structures on the\norder of . 1 Mpc. Dynamical studies confirm that halos formed from such \"self-interacting\"\ndark matter (SIDM) have flatter density cores in better agreement with the observations than\nthe more cuspy profiles predicted by standard CDM.\nBalberg & Shapiro (2002) have recently demonstrated that SMBH formation may be an\ninevitable consequence of dynamical core collapse following the gravothermal catastrophe\nin SIDM halos. This conclusion follows from their earlier dynamical study (Balberg et al.\n2002) which tracked the gravothermal evolution of a virialized, spherical SIDM halo by\nemploying the fluid formalism of Lynden-Bell & Eggleton (1980). In the early universe,\nhalos form with a Press-Schechter (1974) distribution. Typical halos are characterized by\na central mass density \u03c1c & 10\u22122 M\u2299 pc\u22123 , a central velocity dispersion \u03c5c & 100 km s\u22121\nand an elastic scattering cross section \u03c3 & 0.1 cm2 gm\u22121 . The ratio of the scattering mean\nfree path \u03bb to the gravitational scale height H everywhere satisfies the long mean free path\ninequality \u03bb/H \u226b 1 initially. This results in homologous gravothermal contraction at first\n(see Fig. 1.7). However, in SIDM halos the interactions are large-angle scatterings between\nclose neighbors, not cumulative, small-angle Coulomb scatterings by distant particles, as\nin star clusters. Consequently, in contrast to star clusters, the inner core of an SIDM halo\nevolves into the short mean free path (fluid) regime where \u03bb/H \u226a 1. There is a bifurcation\nof the halo into a fluid inner core surrounded by a collisionless outer core and halo (see\n14\n\n\fS. L. Shapiro\nFig. 1.8). Continued heat conduction out of the inner core drives it to a relativistic state,\nwhich eventually becomes unstable to collapse to a black hole.\nThe initial mass of the black hole will be 10\u22128 \u2212 10\u22126 of the total mass of the halo. Very\nmassive SIDM halos form SMBHs with masses MBH & 106 M\u2299 directly. Smaller halos\nbelieved to form by redshift z \u2248 5 produce seed black holes of mass MBH \u2248 102 \u2212 103 M\u2299\nwhich can merge and/or accrete to reach the observed SMBH range. Significantly, this\nscenario for SMBH formation requires no baryons, no prior star formation and no other\nblack hole seed mechanisms (cf. Ostriker 2000; Hennawi & Ostriker 2002).\n\n1.6\n\nConclusions and Final Thoughts\n\nRelativistic gravitation - general relativity - induces a dynamical, radial instability to collapse in all forms of self-gravitating matter whenever the matter becomes sufficiently compact. Plausible scenarios have been proposed that can trigger this instability to\nform SMBHs or their seeds. SMBHs are believed to reside at the centers of quasars, AGNs,\nand many, if not all, normal galaxies with bulges, including the Milky Way. According to\nrecent observations, even globular clusters may contain black holes of intermediate mass\n\u223c 103 \u2212 104 M\u2299 (Gebhardt, Rich, & Ho 2002; Gerssen et al. 2002), although alternative interpretations have been proposed (Baumgardt et al. 2003). Explaining the origin of SMBHs\nis thus a fundamental, unresolved issue of modern cosmology and structure formation. Some\nof the scenarios proposed for forming SMBHs are \"hydrodynamical\" in nature, as in the collapse of fluid SMSs to SMBHs. Some of them are \"stellar dynamical,\" as in the collapse of a\nrelativistic cluster of collisionless particles or compact stars. Still others are \"hybrids,\" as in\nthe case of the collapse of massive stars, built-up by collisions and binary mergers in dense\nclusters undergoing gravothermal contraction; or the case of the collapse of the fluid inner\ncore of an SIDM halo, following its gravothermal contraction to a relativistic state. The\nchallenge in exploring the competing scenarios is that the different physical regimes characterizing them are described by very different sets of equations, requiring very different\nnumerical techniques for solution. Yet numerical simulations have begun to explore many\nof the proposed routes.\nAt the present time we do not know for certain what is the dominant route by which\nobserved SMBHs are formed: Are they born supermassive, or do they grow supermassive\nfrom small seeds? Do the seed black holes grow by merger, by gas accretion or both? Do\nthe first black holes arise from the collapse of ordinary baryonic matter, collisionless dark\nmatter, or from some more exotic form of mass-energy (e.g., scalar fields? gravitational\nwaves?).\nThe growth of black hole seeds by gas accretion is supported by the consistency between\nthe total energy density in QSO light and the BH mass density in local galaxies, adopting a reasonable accretion rest-mass\u2013to\u2013energy conversion efficiency (Soltan 1982; Yu &\nTremaine 2002). But quasars have been discovered out to redshift z \u2248 6, so it follows that\nthe first SMBHs must have formed by zBH & 6 or within tBH . 109 yr after the Big Bang.\nThis timescale provides a tight constraint on SMBH formation. For example, if SMBHs\nindeed grew by accretion, black hole seeds of mass & 105 M\u2299 must have formed by z \u2248 9 to\nhave had sufficient time to reach a mass of \u223c 109 M\u2299 by z \u2248 6 (Gnedin 2001).\nThe correlations MBH \u221d Lbulge (Kormendy & Richstone 1995) and MBH \u221d \u03c5c4 (Gebhardt\net al. 2000; Ferrarese & Merritt 2000) inferred for galaxies provide important additional\nconstraints. For example, SMBH formation by mergers of smaller seed holes during the\n15\n\n\fS. L. Shapiro\nhierarchical build-up of galaxies can account for these scaling laws (Haehnelt & Kauffmann\n2000). But some observations suggest that SMBHs spin rapidly. This conclusion might\nrestrict the significance of merger scenarios, since black holes are typically spun down by\nrepeated mergers (Hughes & Blandford 2003). On the other hand, a single final merger with\na binary companion of comparable mass could drive the spin of a black hole back up to a\nlarge value.\nFurther observations, including the detection of gravitational waves from distant coalescing black hole binaries, might establish the evolutionary tracts and merging histories of\nSMBHs and help identify their principle formation mechanism.\nThis work was supported in part by NSF Grants PHY-0090310 and PHY-0205155 and\nNASA Grants NAG5-8418 and NAG5-10781 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nReferences\nAbel, T., Bryan, G.
