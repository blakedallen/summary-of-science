Their promising applications in molecular electronics [1] are benefited from the merit that the electronic\ncharacteristics of the adsorbed molecule are barely perturbed by the underlying insulating surfaces [2], which\nenables the use of wide-gap insulator as a supporting substrate for a wide variety of technical applications. The\norganic molecule-insulator interface is also relevant to the\nseparation process seen in mining industry, namely various mineral species, usually rocksalt (NaCl) and sylvite\n(KCl) can be distinguished electrostatically when mixing\nwith certain acids, e.g. salicylic acids (SA). It is speculated that in the combined molecule-insulator system, the\npresence of the highest occupied (HOMO) and the lowest\nunoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) can enhance the\ncharge transfer by electronic excitations by several orders\nof magnitude with respect to the bare insulators, because\nthe molecular energy gap is usually much smaller than\nthe band gap of the wide-gap insulators [3, 4]. When the\nadsorbate covered insulating surfaces are brought into\ncontact, those excited electrons, as mobile electrons, can\nhop in-between the surfaces until the thermal equilibrium\nis reached and the Fermi levels are aligned across the interface. This gives rise to a contact voltage due to the\ncharge transfer, which tentatively explains the origin of\nthe electrostatic separation.\nPrevious Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KSDFT) calculations [5, 6] have identified that the adsorption of benzoic acid (BA) and its phenolic derivatives (e.g. SA) on alkali chloride surfaces indeed yields\na much smaller effective KS gap than that of the bare\nsurface. However, the KS gap, defined as the difference\nbetween the eigenvalues of the lowest unoccupied and\nhighest occupied KS states, is not a realistic measure\nof excitation properties. One of the basic issues with\nKS gap is that it is always smaller than the fundamental gap by a derivative discontinuity of the exchangecorrelation energy functional [7] even if the discontinu-\n\nity is present in the functional [8], and this error could\nbe sizable for wide-gap insulators [9]. This gap problem\ncan be alleviated either by hybrid functionals incorporating nonlocal Fock exchange within the generalized KS\nscheme [10], or ultimately from the quasiparticle energies\nin the GW approximation of the self-energy [11]. On the\nother hand, in context of the electronic excitations at\nthe molecule-insulator interface, the electron-hole (e-h)\ninteraction is not directly accessible from the fundamental gap within a single-particle picture, but only available\nin time-dependent DFT [12] and the two-particle manybody perturbation theory (MBPT), namely the BetheSalpeter equation (BSE) approach [13]. The excitonic effect has been found prominent for some organic molecules\n[14\u201316] and wide-gap insulator surfaces [17] in terms of\nMBPT. Nevertheless, little is known about the electronic\nexcitations when organic molecules are adsorbed on insulating surfaces. In this Letter, we demonstrate that,\nbased on G0 W0 and BSE calculations of BA and SA adsorbed on NaCl(001) surface, the lowest singlet excited\nstate for a \u03c0-conjugated molecule-insulator interface involves the contributions from both the surface and the\nadsorbate molecule, instead of the intramolecular \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2217\ntransition. This is not readily expected provided that the\ncoupling of the molecule and the surface is weak.\nThe G0 W0 and BSE calculations were performed on\ntop of the KS-DFT eigenvalues and eigenstates within\nlocal density approximation (LDA). The ground-state geometries were also optimized using DFT-LDA. We employed plane-wave basis sets with a cutoff energy of 70\nRy, with Troullier-Martins norm-conserving pseudopotentials as implemented in abinit [18]. The LDA energy\nlevels were corrected to the first order in the subsequent\nG0 W0 calculations, where the screened Coulomb interaction W is expressed in random phase approximation\n(RPA) (W = \u03b5\u22121 v), with \u03b5 and v being the dielectric\nfunction and the bare Coulomb interaction. The inverse\ndielectric function \u03b5\u22121 was evaluated in the plasmon-pole\napproximation [19]. Spurious Coulomb interactions aris-\n\n\f2\ning from the periodic images were truncated by a box-like\ncutoff [20]. The excitonic effect is finally taken into account by solving the BSE using the quasiparticle energies\nfrom the G0 W0 calculations, which is equivalent to finding the eigenvalues of an effective two-particle excitonic\nHamiltonian H exc as\n\u0012\n\u0013\nH res\nH cpl\nexc\nH\n=\n.\n(1)\n\u2212[H cpl]\u2217 \u2212[H res ]\u2217\nIn terms of the one-particle occupied and empty quasiparticle states (v, c) and quasiparticle energies \u03b5QP\ni , the\nHermitian resonant term H res , containing the transitions\nfrom the occupied to the empty states (v \u2192 c) of positive energies, can be expressed as (\u03b5QP\n\u2212 \u03b5QP\nc\nv )\u03b4vv \u2032 \u03b4cc\u2032 +\nd\nx\nd\n(K + 2K )(vc)(v\u2032 c\u2032 ) , where K and K x refer to the\n(screened) direct e-h Coulomb interaction and the bare\ne-h exchange interaction, respectively. The direct interaction is calculated with the static screening in this\nwork. Analogously, the anti-resonant part \u2212[H res ]\u2217 contains the c \u2192 v transitions of negative energies. The offdiagonal term H cpl = (K d + 2K x )(vc)(c\u2032 v\u2032 ) describes the\ncoupling between the resonant and anti-resonant transitions. Within the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA),\nthis coupling part is often neglected for optical absorption calculations since it is usually much smaller than\nthe resonant part [21]. The TDA significant reduces the\ncomputational cost and becomes the routine for the BSE\ncalculations for the excitations in various systems. However, it is recently found that the overestimation of the\nexcitation energy by TDA can be significant for organic\nmolecules and nanostructures with confined excitations\n[15, 16, 22]. With an efficient iterative approach to the\nnon-Hermitian H exc [16], it is thus timely and necessary\nto go beyond the TDA in the present work. The G0 W0\nand BSE calculations are carried out using the yambo\ncode [23].\nWe first consider the gas-phase molecules. BA is the\nsimplest aromatic carboxylic acid, with one carboxylic\ngroup attached to an aromatic ring. BA can be functionalized to SA when one phenolic group is attached\nto the ortho position. We show in Fig. 1 the molecular orbital energies calculated by LDA and G0 W0 -LDA.\nThe molecules are confined in a box with the dimension of 30.0 \u00d7 30.0 \u00d7 24.0 Bohr3 . The k-point is sampled at the \u0393 point. Over 450 empty states are included\nfor the response function (with a 4 Ry cutoff) and the\nGreen's function for the self-energy (with a 68 Ry cutoff for the exchange self-energy). It is not surprising\nthat LDA distorts the occupied molecular orbitals when\ncompared to the experimental ultraviolet photoemission\nspectra (UPS) [4]. Notably, LDA gives a different order of the three highest occupied orbitals of BA with respect to the G0 W0 result. The G0 W0 predicts that both\nthe HOMO and HOMO-1 are delocalized \u03c0 states of the\ncyclic benzene ring, whereas it turns out that the LDA\nHOMO is the non-bonding state localized around the car-\n\nBA\nUPS\n\nHOMO\n\nHOMO-1\n\nLUMO\n\nHOMO-2\n\nn \u03c0\nG0W0-LDA\n\nLDA\n\n\u03c0 n\n\nSA\nHOMO\n\nUPS\n\nHOMO-1\n\nn \u03c0\n\nLUMO\n\nHOMO-2\n\n\u03c0\nG0W0-LDA\n\nLDA\n\nn \u03c0\n\n\u03c0\n\nEnergy (eV)\n\nFIG. 1.

This is interpreted as a consequence\nof the spurious self-interaction in the local and semilocal\napproximations of KS-DFT, which tends to shift the localized electronic states to higher energies [8]. The effect\nof self-interaction is also observed for SA, where the LDA\nHOMO-2 is blue-shifted towards the HOMO-1 by about\n0.6 eV compared to the quasiparticle energies. We note\nthat the self-interaction error can be effectively lifted by\nthe nonlocal exact-exchange in hybrid functionals, and\nour PW1PW hybrid functional calculations [5] are in line\nwith the G0 W0 quasiparticle energies for the occupied orbitals. Being a dynamic theory, the G0 W0 results are in\nquantitative agreement with the UPS experiment [4]. In\nparticular, the G0 W0 HOMO-3 levels for both molecules\nalign well with the UPS peaks.\nMoving to the unoccupied orbitals, we find that the\nquasiparticle energy corrections are rather substantial.\nAn interesting observation is that the quasiparticle correction to the LUMO+2 is about 2 eV smaller than\nthat to the LUMO and LUMO+1 in the present calculations.

Optical absorption spectra of BA and SA obtained\nby full BSE calculations. The spectra are broadened by an\nartificial Lorentzian of 0.1 eV.\n\nLUMO and LUMO+1, the wavefunction of the LUMO+2\nis largely delocalized away from the molecule, a sign of a\nRydberg orbital [24]. The Rydberg orbital is in general\nnot correctly described by LDA because of the unrealistic exponential decay of the potential in the long-range.\nIn terms of the HOMO-LUMO gap, we see in Fig. 1 that\nthe G0 W0 quasiparticle energy gap is more than twice as\nlarge as the LDA gap.\nReferring to the lowest absorption peaks from available\nUV/visible spectra [25, 26], one notices that the G0 W0\ngaps, as the onsets in the GW -RPA independent-particle\nspectra, are also much larger than the experimental excitation energies (cf. Table I), implying that the bound\ne-h interaction must play an important role in the optical\nabsorption if the G0 W0 gaps are reasonable. When the\ne-h interaction is taken into account in the BSE, excellent agreement with experiment can be achieved in terms\nof the lowest excitation energy. In the BSE calculations\nfor the molecules, the cutoff energies for the direct (K d )\nand exchange (K x ) e-h interactions are 2 Ry and 68 Ry,\nrespectively. We include e-h pairs involving the transitions in an energy window of 33.2 eV in the BSE kernel.\nas shown in Table I. It is seen in Table I that the deviation between the BSE excitation energy and experimental\noptical peak is within 0.12 eV. The coupling part in the\nexcitonic Hamiltonian has a small effect on the lowest\nsinglet excited state for the individual molecules, as the\npeak shifts by merely 0.1 - 0.2 eV using the TDA. The\noptical absorption in Fig. 2 is given by the imaginary\npart of the macroscopic dielectric function \u03b5M (q = 0, \u03c9),\n\nTABLE II.

The lowest singlet\nexcited state for both BA and SA largely correspond to\nthe G0 W0 HOMO \u2192 LUMO transition, i.e. the \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2217\ntransition. The polarization direction dependence of the\nlowest excitation peak can be understood by the symmetries of the HOMO and LUMO wavefunctions illustrated\nin Fig. 1. The e-h pair is very strongly bound, as the\nmolecular exciton binding energies shown in Table I are\nabout half of the fundamental gaps. Due to the nature of\nthe \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2217 transition, the exciton is spatially localized\nat the aromatic benzene ring. The strong excitonic effect\nis an important feature of the benzoic and its phenolic\nderivatives.\nAfter examining the individual molecules, we now proceed with the adsorption on the NaCl(001) surface. The\nmolecules are placed on a four-layer (2\u00d72) NaCl(001) supercell, with a vacuum thickness of at least 15 \u00c5. The\nLDA bulk lattice parameter (a = 5.64 \u00c5) is used. We\nuse a \u0393 centered 3\u00d73 Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh (5\nk-point in the irreducible Brillouin zone). The adsorption geometry optimized by the LDA functional is justified since the long-range van der Waals (vdW) interaction\nhas a negligible influence on the adsorption configuration\n[6]. The molecules are weakly bound to the surface, with\na binding energy of about 0.4 eV from the ionic contribution and 0.5 eV from the vdW interaction [6]. While the\nunit cell is small, the lateral intermolecular interaction is\nstill limited, as is manifested by the small energy level dispersion of the HOMO and LUMO with respect to the k\npoints. For G0 W0 calculations, we applied a total number\nof 960 bands in evaluation of the self-energy, and a cutoff\nof 60 Ry and 4 Ry for the exchange self-energy and the\nresponse function, respectively. Since the lowest excited\nstate of the molecules involves the \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2217 transition, the\nevolution of the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2217 energy gap upon adsorption on\nNaCl(001) was investigated and is presented in Table II\nfor BA and SA. Note that in LDA the \u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 \u2217 gap refers to\nthe (HOMO-1)-LUMO instead of the HOMO-LUMO gap\nfor BA. Analogous to the gas-phase molecules, the G0 W0\nenergy gaps of the adsorbates are significantly larger than\nthe LDA ones. In particular, we find that LDA predicts\nthat the HOMO of BA is below the surface valence band\nmaximum (VBM), which is clearly at variance with our\n\n\f4\n\nAbsorption Im(\u03b5M) (arb. units)\n\nTDA\nFull BSE\n\nBA\n\nTDA\nFull BSE\n\nSA\n\npolarization\nNaCl(001)\n\n3p-\u03c0*\n\n3p-\u03c0*\n\u03b8=0\u00b0\n\n\u03c0-\u03c0*\n\n\u03b8=0\u00b0\n\n\u03c0-\u03c0*\n\npolarization\n\nNaCl(001)\n\n\u03b8=90\u00b0\n\n\u03b8=90\u00b0\n\nEnergy \u03c9 (eV)\n\nEnergy \u03c9 (eV)\n\nFIG. 3. Absorption spectra of the BA and SA molecules adsorbed on NaCl(001) calculated within the Tamm-Dancoff\napproximation (TDA) and full excitonic Hamiltonian. The\nperturbative polarization direction with respect to the surface is denoted by \u03b8. The spectra are broadened by a 0.1 eV\nLorentzian.\n\nearlier hybrid functional results [5] as well as with the\npresent G0 W0 calculation. As the non-bonding state localized at the carboxylic group is in resonance with the\nsurface VBM [5], the misalignment of the energy levels in the LDA calculation is clearly associated with the\nself-interaction error, which places the non-bonding state\ntoo high in energy. It is further revealed in Table II\nthat, while LDA yields almost identical energy gaps for\nthe isolated and the adsorbed molecules, the quasiparticle energy gaps are reduced by about 1 eV when the\nmolecules are in contact with the surface according to the\nG0 W0 calculations. The renormalization of the molecular energy gap in G0 W0 is essentially an effect of the\npolarization in the surface due to the added or removed\nelectron in the adsorbate, which in turn acts back on\nthe adsorbed molecule and shifts its electron affinity and\nionization energy level positions [27]. For example, the\nionization energy level (HOMO) moves up by 0.36 eV\nwhereas the electron affinity level (LUMO) moves down\nby 0.71 eV when a SA molecule is adsorbed on NaCl(001).\nThe asymmetric shifts suggests that the renormalization\nin the present case does not strictly follow the classical\nimage potential theory, and polarizations between the\nmolecules are likely to take place with a full monolayer\ncoverage. Decomposing the self-energy into the bare exchange (\u03a3x ) and the correlation (\u03a3c ) components, we\nfind that the shifts of the energy levels arise solely from\nthe change in the \u03a3c . The polarization effect, thus being\na dynamic correlation effect, cannot be captured by the\nKS eigenvalues in standard DFT approximations. Our\nresults show that the effect can be pronounced even on\nwide-gap insulators with small dielectric constant, such\nas NaCl.\n\nAs the final step, the excitonic effect at the moleculesurface interface is addressed by BSE. We include e-h\npairs with energies up to 33 eV in the two-particle response function. The cutoff energies for the K d and K x\nwere chosen to be 3 Ry and 20 Ry, respectively. The\nlowest excitation energies are converged within 0.2 eV.\nIn Fig. 3 the optical spectra calculated within the TDA\nand the full BSE calculation are presented. We first discuss the TDA results. The first excitation peak appears\nat around 4.1 eV for both the BA and SA adsorbate systems. This peak is assigned to the \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2217 transition\nof the molecule according to a full diagonalization of the\nTDA Hamiltonian. Going from the parallel perturbing\nfield (\u03b8 = 0\u25e6 ) to the perpendicular polarization (\u03b8 = 90\u25e6 ),\nthe intensity of the \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2217 peak does not change much\nbecause the molecules are tilted on the surface. Moving\nto higher photon energies, we see that the second lowest peak appears at 4.6-4.7 eV for both molecules, which\nprimarily comprises the excitation from the surface VBM\nto the molecular \u03c0 \u2217 orbital, i.e. the Cl 3p \u2192 \u03c0 \u2217 transition. This peak is thus clearly attributed to a charge\ntransfer exciton, which in principle arises from the direct\noverlap between the surface Cl states and the delocalized\n\u03c0 \u2217 orbital of the adsorbate. The observed charge transfer exciton is rather surprising, because in the ground\nstate the charge transfer is very small from the surface\nto the molecule [5]. At 6.0-6.1 eV, the strongest absorption peak appearing in the parallel polarization stems\nfrom the NaCl(001) surface exciton, which lies about 1\neV below the bulk exciton due to the image states outside\nthe surface [17]. The peak related to the surface exciton\nis suppressed for the transverse field.\nWhen the coupling part is switched on in the full BSE\ncalculation, the valence band 3p \u2192 \u03c0 \u2217 peak experiences a\nsizable red-shift by 1.3-2.0 eV. Remarkably, not only the\nexcitation energy shifts, but the intensity of the 3p \u2192 \u03c0 \u2217\ntransition also grows much stronger when \u03b8 = 90\u25e6 . Such\na large perpendicular transition dipole moment further\nevidences that the exciton is spatially distributed along\nsurface normal. The much stronger oscillator strength of\nthis peak for the adsorbed SA molecule is benefited from\nits adsorption configuration, as the SA molecule is more\nparallel and closer to the surface than the BA [6], giving\nrise to a stronger overlap between the VBM and the \u03c0 \u2217\norbital. On the other hand, the lowest singlet molecular\nexcited state and the surface excited state are not much\ninfluenced by the coupling part. As a result, the lowest\nexcited state for the adsorbate system is now replaced by\nthe 3p \u2192 \u03c0 \u2217 transition, with excitation energies of 3.3\neV and 2.7 eV for the BA and SA adsorbate systems,\nrespectively. Our results shows that the presence of the\ncharge transfer exciton considerably lowers the effective\nexcited energy of the molecule-insulator system, which\nmay serve as the key ingredient in the contact charging\nmodel.\nThe striking failure of TDA reveals that the coupling\n\n\f5\npart becomes comparable to the resonant part in the excitonic Hamiltonian for the 3p \u2192 \u03c0 \u2217 transition. In fact,\nwe find that even without the direct interaction K d , the\ncoupling term with the exchange interaction K x alone\nalready shifts the lowest excitation energy from 4.6 eV in\nTDA to 3.0 eV in the case of SA. Therefore, the 3p \u2192 \u03c0 \u2217\nexciton has a prominent exchange interaction between\nthe electrons and holes, making TDA insufficient in describing this excited state.\nTo conclude, we find that even when a conjugated\norganic molecule is weakly adsorbed on an wide-gap\ninsulating surface, the presence of the exciton at the\nmolecule-insulator interface can provide a much more\neffective channel for electronic excitations than the intramolecular transitions. The formation of the lowest\nexcited state involving transitions from the surface to\nthe molecule is driven by the sizable e-h exchange interactions.\nThis work was supported by K+S AG.
