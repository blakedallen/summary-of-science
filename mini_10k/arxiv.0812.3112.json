Because of this property the moment of inertia of a vessel containing a superfluid is different from\n(smaller than) that when the liquid is in the normal state.\nThis effect is largest in the absence of vortices, when superfluid flow is irrotational. The difference between the\nmoments of inertia when the liquid, confined by boundary conditions, is in the normal and superfluid states is\nknown as the \"non-classical rotational inertia\" (NCRI).\nThe occurrence of NCRI is often used as an experimental\nsignature of superfluidity. Superfluid hydrodynamics and\nthe resulting NCRI have been studied extensively [1] in\nthe past for simple geometries, such as spherical, cylindrical or rectangular containers rotating about a symmetry\naxis. Because of several recent developments, some of\nwhich are briefly discussed below, it has become necessary to understand the properties of flow of superfluids in\nenclosures of more complicated geometry. These provide\nthe motivation for our present study.\nRecent observations [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] of NCRI in\ntorsional oscillation experiments on solid 4 He have been\ninterpreted as the occurrence of a \"supersolid\" phase.\nThis interpretation of the experimental results is controversial. There is experimental [5, 9] and theoreti-\n\n\u2217 Electronic address: cdgupta@physics.iisc.ernet.in; Also at Condensed Matter Theory Unit, Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced\nScientific Research, Bangalore 560064, India\n\u2020 Electronic address: otvalls@umn.edu; Also at Minnesota Supercomputer Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455\n\ncal [10, 11] evidence suggesting that the observed NCRI\nis due to superfluidity along crystalline defects such as\ngrain boundaries in a polycrystalline sample and networks of dislocation lines. Since these extended defects\nform complex disordered structures, calculations of the\nflow properties and the rotational inertia of a superfluid\nconfined in irregular-shaped channels are necessary for\na quantitative assessment of whether this mechanism is\nthe correct explanation of the observed results. In this\ncontext, it is important to examine whether the superfluid component can flow along continuous closed paths\nin the sample. Since the geometry of the network of\ndefects would depend on thermodynamic variables such\nas temperature and pressure, and on the cell geometry,\nthe availability of such paths would also depend on these\nparameters and conditions. Thus, an understanding of\nthe dependence of the NCRI on such variables requires,\nfor example, a calculation of how the NCRI arising from\na blocked ring of superfluid changes as the blockage is\nremoved. To check whether the observed NCRI is due\nto the occurrence of extended superfluidity, the NCRI\nof samples in which the solid 4 He is confined in the annular region between two concentric cylinders has been\nmeasured [2, 7] in the presence of a barrier in the annulus that prevents possible flow of the superfluid along a\nclosed path surrounding the rotation axis (the common\naxis of the cylinders). The NCRI observed under these\nconditions is found to be much smaller than that for samples in which the artificial block is not present. The calculation just mentioned is obviously relevant for a quantitative understanding of the results of such experiments.\nFinally, an understanding of experimental results [6, 7, 8]\non the dependence of the NCRI on the frequency of torsional oscillations requires a theoretical analysis of vortex\n\n\f2\nformation and critical velocity in superfluids confined in\nirregular-shaped channels.\nOur study is also partly motivated by the recent explosion of activity in experimental and theoretical studies of superfluidity and other quantum phenomena in\ntrapped, ultracold atomic systems [12, 13]. Also, there\nhave been many experimental studies of the flow properties and NCRI of superfluids confined in porous media such as vycor glass and containers packed with fine\npowder [14, 15, 16, 17]. The first experimental observation [18] of \"supersolid\" behavior was in a torsional oscillator experiment on solid 4 He confined in vycor glass.\nSince the pores in these systems have complex geometry,\nit is necessary to work out the hydrodynamics of superfluids in irregular-shaped channels in order to understand\nthe results of these experiments in quantitative detail.\nThus, we study here the hydrodynamics of a superfluid confined in a two-dimensional region between two\nconcentric circular arcs, each of which subtends an angle\n\u03b2 at their common center. The annular region between\nthe two arcs is bounded on two sides by straight walls\nalong the radial direction. Thus, the special case with\n\u03b2 = 2\u03c0 corresponds to a ring that is blocked by a wall\nplaced perpendicular to its inner and outer peripheries.\nThis two-dimensional geometry corresponds, neglecting\nedge effects, to that used in many experiments on supersolid behavior in 4 He where the helium is confined in the\nannular region between two concentric cylinders, under\nthe assumption that the cylinders are long enough and\nthe confined system is homogeneous along the cylinder\naxis. In the limit of vanishing inner radius, the geometry\nwe study corresponds to that of a wedge with opening\nangle \u03b2. The limit \u03b2 = 2\u03c0 in this case represents a circular container with a straight blocking wall extending\nfrom the center of the circle to its periphery.\nWe assume throughout the paper that the fluid is incompressible, which is appropriate for superfluid Helium.\nWe first consider the case where there are no vortices (so\nthat the superfluid flow is irrotational), and solve the hydrodynamic equation for the velocity field for rotation\nabout an axis perpendicular to the plane of the system\nand passing through the common center of the arcs that\nform its boundary. The sample geometry is reflected in\nthe boundary conditions for the velocity field. For incompressible and irrotational flow, the velocity field can\nbe expressed in terms of either a scalar or a vector potential (stream function), analogous to those in electromagnetic theory, both of which satisfy the Laplace equation\nwith appropriate boundary conditions. The scalar potential method is simpler, and leads to series that converge\nrapidly. We have used this method to obtain the velocity field for \u03b2 = 2\u03c0 and \u03b2 = \u03c0. For a general value of\n\u03b2, however, the stream function method, although more\ndifficult in that it leads to series that are not convergent,\nbut Borel summable, is more powerful. We have therefore used it to obtain the velocity field for arbitrary \u03b2.\nWe present analytic results for the velocity field and the\nmoment of inertia for arbitrary values of the inner and\n\nouter radii and the opening angle \u03b2. We also derive a\nsimple \"parallel axis\" theorem that relates the moment\nof inertia for rotation about any axis perpendicular to the\nplane of the system to the calculated value for rotation\nabout an axis passing through the center of mass.\nIn the context of experimental observations of NCRI\nin solid 4 He, the most important result of our study is\nabout the NCRI of a blocked ring. When the ring is\nblocked, the superfluid can not flow through it. However, due to the irrotational nature of superfluid flow,\nthe moment of inertia is smaller than that for rigid-body\nrotation. Therefore, the drop in the moment of inertia\nwhen the block is removed (the superfluid does not contribute to the moment of inertia when there is no block)\nis less than the rigid-body value. Our calculations show\nthat the moment of inertia of a blocked ring whose width\nis small compared to its radius is very close to its moment\nof inertia for rigid rotation, so that unblocking the ring\n(i.e. the opening up of a closed path) produces a large\ndrop in the moment of inertia (nearly equal to its rigidrotation value), which would show up in an experiment\nas a relatively large value of the NCRI. Thus, the onset of\nNCRI in experiments on solid 4 He may correspond to the\nunblocking of large closed paths in the network of defects\nalong which the superfluid component is supposed to exist. Our results for the NCRI of a superfluid confined\nin a blocked ring can be compared directly with those of\nexperiments [2, 7] in which the NCRI of solid 4 He confined in an annular cell is measured both in the presence\nand in the absence of a barrier that blocks flow around\nthe annular channel. We show that our results, when\ncombined with accurate measurements of the NCRI, can\nprovide valuable information about the structure of the\nsuperfluid network in solid 4 He, and discuss the validity\nof our hydrodynamic description for superfluid flow in\nnarrow channels such as those along crystalline defects\nin solid 4 He.\nAn interesting new result of our calculation is that the\nvelocity field for a wedge with \u03b2 > \u03c0 diverges at the tip\nof the wedge for any nonzero value of the angular velocity\n\u03a9. This means that the implicit assumption that the velocity field nowhere exceeds the Landau critical velocity\nis in principle mathematically incorrect for these wedges:\nfor any nonzero value of \u03a9, there must be a region near\nthe tip where the liquid is in the normal state. We show\nthat the size of the region where this occurs is too small\nto have any measurable consequence in 4 He experiments\nperformed with usual geometries. This divergence of the\nvelocity can be removed by the presence of a single vortex. We calculate the position of this vortex and the\nrotational inertia in its presence. Our calculations uncover also several interesting mathematical issues and we\nindicate ways of addressing them. Some of these were\nalso present in earlier studies [1] of superfluid hydrodynamics, while some are new. We discuss these questions\nas they appear throughout the paper.\nWhether vortices appear or not is in general determined by the free-energy cost of creating a vortex. We\n\n\f3\nwill show that for typical experiments on 4 He, vortices do\nnot occur for sufficiently small angular velocities. However, as pointed out in Ref. [1], states with vortices\npresent will have, at sufficiently larger values of the angular velocity, a lower free energy than the vortex-free state.\nWe calculate the critical angular velocity for vortex nucleation which turns out, for typical 4 He samples, to be in\nthe experimentally important range of angular velocities.\nWe show how the rotational inertia is modified by these\nvortex excitations. These results are relevant for understanding the experimentally observed dependence of the\nNCRI of \"supersolid\" 4 He on the frequency of torsional\noscillations [6, 7, 8].\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section II, we describe in detail our calculations. We present\nfirst two alternative methods of calculating the velocity\nfield in the vortex free case, and discuss the results obtained for this field and the moment of inertia. We compare our results for the NCRI with those of experiments\non solid 4 He in blocked annular geometry and point out\nother implications of our results for experimental studies\nof superfluidity. We then explain how to include vortices\nin our description and calculate the critical angular velocity for vortex nucleation. A summary of our results is\npresented in the concluding section III.\n\nthe component of \u03a9 \u00d7 r along n\u0302 at that point:\nv(r) * n\u0302 = (\u03a9 \u00d7 r) * n\u0302\n\nwere r is a vector from O to a point on the boundary.\nThe point O is not necessarily the center of mass of the\nsystem: in general we will take it to be, for reasons of\nobvious computational convenience, the center of the arc\nor arcs that are part of the boundaries of our system.\nThere are two obvious ways to solve Eqs. (2.1). The\nfirst is to introduce a scalar potential V (r) such that\nv(r) = \u2207V (r). In that case V (r) satisfies the Laplace\nequation, \u22072 V (r) = 0, and Eq. (2.2) is a Neumann\nboundary condition on V . Alternatively, one can introduce a stream function \u03a8(r) such that:\nvx = \u2212\u2202\u03a8/\u2202y\nvy = \u2202\u03a8/\u2202x,\n\nA.\n\nRESULTS\n\nFormulation of the problem\n\nWe consider, as explained above, superfluid flow in an\nideal cylinder, long enough in the z direction so that\nedge effects are negligible and the problem quasi twodimensional. The cross sections of the cylinders that we\nwill consider will be bounded by two concentric circular\narcs of radii a and b (with a > b) and encompassing an\nangle that we will call \u03b2. In the limit b = 0 the shape\nof this cross section is that of a circular wedge. We will\nconsider all values of \u03b2, 0 < \u03b2 \u2264 2\u03c0. It must be emphasized that the case \u03b2 = 2\u03c0 is not the same as that of a\nring, since a boundary along a radius still exists.\nIn the absence of vortices (the generalization to the\ncase when vortices are present will be discussed below)\nthe superfluid velocity field v(r) for an incompressible\nfluid satisfies:\n\u2207 * v(r) = 0\n\u2207 \u00d7 v(r) = 0.\n\n(2.1a)\n(2.1b)\n\nThe boundary condition corresponding to superfluid rotation around some center O with uniform angular velocity \u03a9 is that [1] the normal component of the fluid's\nvelocity at the boundary must equal the normal component of the rigid-body velocity \u03a9 \u00d7 r at that point. That\nis, the component of v(r) along the outward normal n\u0302 to\nthe boundary must equal, at any point on the boundary,\n\n(2.3a)\n(2.3b)\n\nwhere one can think of \u03a8 as the z component of a vector\npotential [v(r) = \u2212\u2207 \u00d7 (\u1e91\u03a8(r))]. It is obvious that \u03a8(r)\nalso satisfies the Laplace equation, \u22072 \u03a8(r) = 0. Now,\nhowever, the boundary conditions are of the Dirichlet\nform [1]: at any point in the boundary,\n\u03a8(r) =\n\nII.\n\n(2.2)\n\n1 2\n\u03a9r .\n2\n\n(2.4)\n\nIt turns out, as we will see, that for certain special values of \u03b2 such as \u03c0 and 2\u03c0, the scalar potential method\nis much simpler to use and leads to expressions for v(r)\nin the form of rapidly convergent series which are very\nconvenient. However, for other values of \u03b2, this method\nbecomes rather awkward. The stream function method\non the other hand can be used for any value of \u03b2, but the\nresulting expressions involve asymptotic series. These\nare, however, Borel summable and agree with the results obtained from V (r) in the cases where the scalar\npotential method works well. For this reason, we will\nfirst present here results obtained from V (r) for \u03b2 = 2\u03c0\nand \u03b2 = \u03c0 and then consider the general case using the\nstream function.\nOnce the velocity field is obtained, the angular momentum (and hence the moment of inertia) can be calculated\nby straightforward integration of the velocity field. In\nthis way, the depletion of the moment of inertia from its\nrigid body value is obtained. In general our origin O is\nnot the center of mass (COM) of the system: therefore\nit is important to discuss an interesting property of the\nnature of the parallel axis theorem shift in the superfluid\ncase. If one considers the moment of inertia of the superCOM\nfluid with respect to the COM, ISF\none finds, of course,\nthat it is always smaller than that of the corresponding\nCOM\nrigid object (RO) of the same shape and density, IRO\n.\nCOM\nIndeed, for the case of a circle ISF\nvanishes. With respect to an arbitrary origin O one has for the superfluid\nT\nCOM\nPA\na total moment of inertia ISF\n= ISF\n+ ISF\nwhere the\nlast term is the parallel axis shift. The key point here\nis that this shift is the same as that for the rigid object.\n\n\f4\nOne has:\nPA\nPA\nISF\n= IRO\n.\n\n(2.5)\n\nThe proof of this theorem is very simple: the problem,\nas defined by the above equations and boundary conditions, is linear. If one shifts the origin from the COM to\na point a distance R away from it, the velocity field of\nthe boundaries shifts to v = (r + R) \u00d7 \u03a9. In view of this,\nthe linearity of the problem, and the boundary condition\nEq. (2.2), the solution of the shifted problem is the velocity field computed with respect to rotations around the\nCOM, plus a uniform velocity field R \u00d7 \u03a9. This second\nfield trivially satisfies the equations and takes care of the\nadditional term in the boundary condition. But it is trivial to verify that such a constant field leads simply to a\nparallel axis theorem shift in the moment of inertia equal\nto that for the corresponding rigid object. This applies\nirrespective of the shape of the object: it is not limited to\nthe wedge shapes considered here. It is straightforward\nto check by direct calculation that it applies, for example, to the ellipsoidal shapes of Ref. 1. This theorem has\nphysical consequences: since the parallel axis shift cannot\nbe \"depleted\" from its RO value by the superfluid flow,\nin general the fractional depletion of ISF will always be\nlargest when the rotation is around the COM.\nB.\n\nradius). For this case, one can very simply use the scalar\npotential method. We write, in polar coordinates:\nV (r, \u03c6) =\n\nX\n\nm\u22651\n\nv\u03c6 (r, \u03c6) = \u03a9r cos(2\u03c6) \u2212\n\n16\u03a9a\n\u03c0\n16\u03a9a\n\u03c0\n\nX m\nam rm/2\u22121 cos(m\u03c6/2)\n2\nm\u22651\nX m\nbm rm/2\u22121 sin(m\u03c6/2)\n\u2212\n2\n\nv\u03c6 (r, \u03c6) =\n\nmust equal \u03a9r at \u03c6 = 0. This immediately tells us that\nall the am vanish except a4 , which equals \u03a9/2. The radial\ncomponent is then:\nvr (r, \u03c6) = \u03a9r sin(2\u03c6) +\n\nX m\nbm rm/2\u22121 cos(m\u03c6/2)\n2\n\nm\u22651\n\n(2.8)\nAt r = a we have vr = 0 and from this one obtains that\nall the bn with even n are zero while for odd n:\n32\u03a9a\n.\n\u03c0n(n2 \u2212 16)an/2\u22121\n\n(2.9)\n\nFrom these and Eqs. (2.7) and (2.8) we have the final\nresult for the velocity field:\n\nX\n\n\u03c1n/2\u22121\n\n1\ncos(n\u03c6/2)\nn2 \u2212 16\n\n(2.10a)\n\nX\n\n\u03c1n/2\u22121\n\n1\nsin(n\u03c6/2)\nn2 \u2212 16\n\n(2.10b)\n\nn>0, n odd\n\nTwo remarks are needed about these simple results:\nfirst, the series involved are very rapidly convergent. Second, the velocity components have a square root singularity at the origin. Mathematically, the singularity\nis integrable, and allows for the formal calculation of\nthe moment of inertia. Physically, the relevant number is the value of r at which the velocity would exceed the Landau critical velocity vc . For liquid 4 He,\nvc \u2248 2.5 \u00d7 104 cm/s [19], and in typical experiments on\nsupersolid behavior, the maximum value of \u03a9 is less than\n0.1s\u22121 (see for example, [2, 6]). This would mean than\nonly at values of r/a around 10\u221211 would vc be exceeded.\nSuch small values of r would not have any experimentally\n\n(2.7)\n\nm\u22651\n\nn>0, n odd\n\nwhere \u03c1 \u2261 r/a.\n\nbm rm/2 cos(m\u03c6/2).\n\nm\u22651\n\nbn =\n\nTo illustrate the results, let us first turn to the simplest\ncase where \u03b2 = 2\u03c0, b = 0 (a circle with a wall along its\n\nX\n\n(2.6)\nWith the radial wall set along the \u03c6 = 0 direction, the\nazimuthal component of the velocity,\n\nScalar potential method for \u03b2 = 2\u03c0 and \u03b2 = \u03c0\n\nvr (r, \u03c6) = \u03a9r sin(2\u03c6) +\n\nam rm/2 sin(m\u03c6/2)+\n\nmeasurable consequence (the hydrodynamic description\nwe use would not even apply to such length scales). Also\nthis divergence is not present for nonzero values of the inner radius b, and the inner radius is finite (of order 10\u22121\ncm) in torsion and rotation experiments. Thus, this divergence is not important for 4 He. This divergence may\nhave observable consequences in Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in cold atomic systems [12, 13], although\nour incompressibility and uniform density assumptions\nare not applicable to BEC in cold atomic systems, where\nthe high compressibility and the confining potential introduces substantial variations in the density. We show\nlater that the divergence discussed above is present in\nblocked wedges for all values of \u03b2 greater than \u03c0. The\n\n\f5\neffects of this divergence are discussed in sections II D\nand II E.\nThe angular momentum is obtained by integration of\nrv\u03c6 over the sample and the moment of inertia is just the\nratio of the angular momentum and the angular velocity\n\u03a9. We will use units in which the areal mass density is\nunity.

In that case\nthe only significant difference is that in the expression for\nV (r) one must write:\n\nV (r, \u03c6) =\n\n(2.11)\n\nv\u03c6 (r, \u03c6) = \u03a9r cos(2\u03c6) \u2212\n\n8\u03a9a\n\u03c0\n8\u03a9a\n\u03c0\n\nX\n\nn>0, n odd\n\n1\n.\nn(n2 \u2212 4)(n + 2)\n\nm\u22651\n\n\u03c1n\u22121\n\n1\ncos(n\u03c6)\nn2 \u2212 4\n\n(2.14a)\n\nX\n\n\u03c1n\u22121\n\n1\nsin(n\u03c6).\nn2 \u2212 4\n\n(2.14b)\n\nn>0, n odd\n\n(2.15)\n\nNumerically, we have ISF = 0.488a4 which gives a ratio\nISF /IRO = 0.621, a value higher than that for the circle.\nHowever, we must recall that in this case O is not the\nCOM and that (as shown above) there is no reduction in\nthe parallel axis term so that from the point of view of\nthe COM the reduction must be larger. Indeed one finds\nthat:\nCOM\nISF\n= 0.41,\nCOM\nIRO\n\nbm rm cos(m\u03c6).\n\nX\n\nn>0, n odd\n\nThe series are again convergent, and now the previously\nfound integrable singularity at the origin is absent. The\nmoment of inertia with respect to the origin is:\n16a4\n\u03c0\n\nX\n\n(2.13)\nAs before, all the coefficients an are determined from the\nboundary conditions on v\u03c6 at \u03c6 = 0 and \u03c6 = \u03c0. Both\nare satisfied if all an vanish except a1 = \u03a9/2. The bn\nare determined then from the boundary condition on vr .\nThe result for the velocity field is:\n\n(2.12)\n\nvr (r, \u03c6) = \u03a9r sin(2\u03c6) +\n\nISF = \u2212\n\nam rm sin(m\u03c6) +\n\nm\u22651\n\nwhich, after numerically evaluating the rapidly convergent series, gives ISF = 0.693a4 . Thus we have for this\nobstructed circle:\nISF\n\u2248 0.441.\nIRO\n\nX\n\n(2.16)\n\n\u03b2 = \u03c0/2 and doubles again the angles and powers in\nthe expression for V (r) one finds that it is not possible\nto satisfy the boundary condition for v\u03c6 at \u03c6 = 0 and\n\u03c6 = \u03c0/2 from a single term in the first sum (the an coefficients) in the potential. Similar difficulties are found\nat e.g. \u03b2 = 3\u03c0/2. Although these difficulties should not\nbe unsurmountable, we will instead use the stream function method in the general case and deal appropriately\nthere with the mathematical difficulties associated with\nthe asymptotic series that then result.\nHowever, one can easily generalize this simple procedure, for the above values of \u03b2, to the physically more\nrelevant case where b > 0. We will consider here the important case of an obstructed ring, \u03b2 = 2\u03c0. In that case\none simply has to add to the potential in Eq. (2.6) the\nappropriate negative powers of r. The coefficients are\nthen found from the boundary conditions on vr at r = a\nand r = b. One then obtains the velocity fields:\n\nwhich is actually a little less than that for the circle.\nOne can see that it is awkward to extend this simple\nprocedure to other values of \u03b2.

Since, when unblocked, its moment of\ninertia vanishes, we see that in such a channel there will\nbe a sharp discontinuity in I as it is blocked or unblocked.\nIn a sample containing a number of such channels, discontinuities or glitches in I will occur as the channels are\nblocked or unblocked. As c \u2192 1, R \u2192 1 and the unblocking would drop R from one to zero, the maximum\namount. One should recall, however, that I vanishes at\nc = 1 for both the superfluid and the rigid body. In an\nexperimental situation one would measure the difference\nin I with the channel blocked and unblocked which is\nISF itself. This quantity has a broad maximum centered\naround c \u2248 0.52 as one can see in the second panel of\nFig. 2. There we plot ISF itself in units such that a is\nunity.

(2.3- 2.4)). Following Ref. [1], the general solution for \u03a8(r) for arbitrary \u03b2 can be written as\n\u03a8(r) =\n\n\u221e\n1 X 1 n\u03c0/\u03b2\nG(r, \u03c6; r\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ) = \u2212\nr\n\u03c0 n=1 n <\n\n1\nn\u03c0/\u03b2\n\nr>\n\nZ\n\ndl\u2032 r\u20322 n\u2032 * \u2207\u2032 G(r\u2032 , r),\n\n(2.19)\n\nR\nwhere the line integral dl\u2032 is over the boundary of the\nsystem, n\u2032 is a unit vector along the outward normal to\nthe boundary, and G(r, r\u2032 ) is the Green's function for the\nLaplacian operator, satisfying the equation\n\n(2.18)\n\nThe behavior of this quantity as a function of aspect ratio\nc is well worth noting. In the first panel of Fig. 2 we plot\nthe ratio R \u2261 ISF /IRO for a blocked ring of aspect ratio\nc, vs. c. As noted above, the value for c = 0 (blocked circle) would, strictly speaking, have to be corrected, but\nthe range of c affected by this is negligible. The ratio\nR increases very quickly with c: at c = 1/2 it already\nreaches 0.875 while at c = 0.75 it exceeds 97%. We see,\n\n1\n\u03a9\n2\n\n\u22072 G(r, r\u2032 ) = \u03b4(r \u2212 r\u2032 ),\n\n(2.20)\n\nand the boundary conditions G(r, r\u2032 ) = 0 for all r on\nthe boundary of the system. Thus, \u03a8(r) and hence, the\nvelocity field, can be obtained from Eq. (2.19) once an\nexpression for the Green's function, satisfying Eqs. (2.20)\nand its boundary condition is obtained.\nAs in section II B, we first consider, for simplicity, the\ncase b = 0, which corresponds to a wedge of radius a\nand opening angle \u03b2. The Green's function in this case\nis easily obtained [20] to be\n\nn\u03c0/\u03b2\n\nr>\n\u2212 2n\u03c0/\u03b2\na\n\n!\n\nsin(n\u03c0\u03c6/\u03b2) sin(n\u03c0\u03c6\u2032 /\u03b2),\n\n(2.21)\n\nwhere r> (r< ) is the larger (smaller) one of the two radial coordinates r and r\u2032 .

(2.23) go to zero for \u03b2 = \u03c0/2 and n = 1. The numerators also vanish for these values of \u03b2 and n, so that\nfinite contributions that vary smoothly with \u03b2 across \u03c0/2\nare obtained for the velocity components. Similar behavior is found for \u03b2 = 3\u03c0/2 for which the n = 3 term in\nthe denominators in Eqs. (2.23) vanishes. These results\nalso exhibit, for \u03b2 > \u03c0, a singularity r\u03c0/\u03b2\u22121 as r \u2192 0,\nwhich can be readily seen from Eqs. (2.23) to arise from\nthe n = 1 term in the sum. This is in agreement with\nwhat we found from the scalar potential method. As\ndiscussed in detail in the previous subsection, this divergence is not physically relevant for 4 He, but may have\nobservable consequences in experiments on cold atomic\nsystems. Its possible physical effects are discussed in sections II D and II E. This singularity is always integrable:\ntherefore, the angular momentum of the superfluid about\nthe origin (tip of the wedge) is easily calculated for all \u03b2\nusing these expressions for the velocity components. The\nresult for the moment of inertia about O is\n\u0013\n\u0012\nX\n2a4\n1\n1 n\u03c0\nISF =\n.

(2.11) which was obtained using the scalar potential\nmethod. In particular, the series in Eq. (2.25) converges\nmore slowly than the one in Eq. (2.11). However, it can\neasily be shown that these two expressions for the moment of inertia are mathematically identical. We have\nalso checked that a similar situation applies when the results for the moment of inertia obtained from Eqs. (2.23)\nfor \u03b2 = \u03c0 are compared to those obtained in the preceding section using the scalar potential method.\n\n(2.23b)\n\nHowever, the situation is much more complicated\nwhen, instead of comparing the moments of inertia, one\ncompares directly the velocity fields obtained by the two\nmethods. In this case it is not sufficient to add or subtract a series that converges to zero. The reason is that\nwhile the series in Eqs. (2.10) converge for all angles \u03c6\nand for any r 6= 0, those in Eqs. (2.23) and (2.22) do\nnot. This question is related to other technical difficulties with the result (2.22), and in general with the stream\nfunction method, which we will further address below.\nThe moment of inertia of the wedge for rigid-body rotation about O is IRO = \u03b2a4 /4, and its moment of inertia for rigid-body rotation about its COM is given by\nCOM\nPA\nPA\nIRO\n= IRO \u2212 IRO\nwith IRO\n= 8a4 sin2 (\u03b2/2)/(9\u03b2). Using these results and Eq. (2.24), we have calculated the\nCOM\nCOM\nratios ISF /IRO and ISF\n/IRO\nas functions of the angle \u03b2. The results are shown in Fig. 3. These ratios are of\ncourse less than unity, the level of suppression being given\nby the NCRI effect. In the figure we see that this fractional suppression is always larger in the COM frame,\nCOM\nCOM\nthat is, ISF /IRO is always higher than ISF\n/IRO\n, except of course at \u03b2 = 2\u03c0 where the two are the same.\nThis is in agreement with the theorem proved at the end\nCOM\nCOM\nof Sec. II A. It is interesting that the ratio ISF\n/IRO\nis not a monotonic function of \u03b2 \u2013 it exhibits a minimum\nat \u03b2 = \u03c0/2.\nA representative plot of the velocity field for a wedge\nwith \u03b2 = (7/8)2\u03c0 is shown in Fig. 4. The velocity vector\nfield is plotted in arbitrary relative units, as in the first\npanel of Fig. 1. It is instructive to compare that panel\nwith Fig. 4. In the earlier case we have c = 0.5 whereas\nin Fig. 4 we have a wedge, c = 0. The rise in the absolute\nvalue of the velocity as r \u2192 0 can now be seen. On the\nother hand, the behavior of of vr as a function of \u03c6 is\nclearly very similar: it follows from the second panel of\nFig. 1 that vr is very small except for angles near the\nradial boundaries, and this is clearly the case also for\nthis c = 0 wedge. The behavior of v\u03c6 with \u03c6 is also quite\nsimilar.\nWe now return to the technical difficulties with the\ngeneral solution for the velocity field obtained above via\n\n\f9\nthe stream function. As noted in section II A, the quantity \u03a8(r, \u03c6) should be equal to \u03a9r2 /2 at all points on the\nboundary, and the physical velocity field should satisfy\nthe boundary conditions v\u03c6 (r, \u03c6) = r\u03a9 for \u03c6 = 0, \u03b2 and\nvr (r, \u03c6) = 0 for r = a. It is easily seen from Eqs. (2.22)\nand (2.23b) that both \u03a8(r, \u03c6) and v\u03c6 (r, \u03c6) vanish for\n\u03c6 = 0 and \u03c6 = \u03b2 (since sin(n\u03c0\u03c6/\u03b2) = 0 for these values\nof \u03c6). Thus the boundary condition on the radii appears\nto be violated even though the construction of the vector\npotential via the Green's function would seem to ensure\nthat it will not be. As to Eq. (2.23a) for the radial component of the velocity, it can be written as\n\n1\n\n0.6\n\nI\n\n/I\n\nSF RO\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\u03b2\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nCOM\nCOM\nFIG. 3: The ratios ISF /IRO (upper curve), and ISF\n/IRO\n(lower curve) for a superfluid wedge as a function of the opening angle \u03b2, 0 < \u03b2 \u2264 2\u03c0.

Thus,\nthis component also appears not to satisfy the required\nboundary conditions. Numerically, however, we have\nfound that these quantities do approach values consistent\nwith the required boundary conditions as the boundaries\nare approached from inside, but there is a discontinuity\nas the boundary is approached and the values exactly at\nthe boundaries do not satisfy the boundary conditions.\nThis does not affect the calculated values of the angu-\n\nX\n\ncos(n\u03c0\u03c6/\u03b2).\n\n(2.26)\n\nn>0, n odd\n\nlar momentum and the moment of inertia because these\nquantities are not sensitive to the values of the velocity\ncomponents exactly at the boundary.\nHowever, this numerical argument is not fully satisfactory. Fortunately there are better ones. First, one can\nsee that this behavior is associated with the nonconvergence of the series. The last term in Eq. (2.26), for example, is not merely nonzero: the series that it contains\nis not convergent while that in the first term is. Indeed\nthe rearrangement of terms leading from Eq. (2.23a) to\n\n\f10\nEq. (2.26) isolates just this nonconvergent part. However,\nby rewriting the cosines in terms of exponentials one can\nverify that the series in the last term of Eq. (2.26) is\nBorel summable[22] (and also Euler summable) with the\nresult being zero. With this proviso, Eq. (2.26) satisfies\nthe boundary condition analytically. Similar arguments\ncan be made for \u03a8\u03a9 and for the azimuthal component of\nthe velocity.\nThis mathematical problem can also be solved by redefining the stream function as\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n2\u03a9r2 \uf8f0 X\n\u03c0\uf8fb\n1\n\u03a8(r, \u03c6) \u2192 \u03a8(r, \u03c6)\u2212\nsin(n\u03c0\u03c6/\u03b2) \u2212\n,\n\u03c0\nn\n4\nn>0, n odd\n\n(2.27)\nwhere the first term in the right side is that given by\nEq. (2.22). The second term in the right side, which\nis subtracted from the old expression, is zero for all\npoints inside the wedge [21], and is equal to \u2212\u03a9r2 /2 for\n\u03c6 = 0, \u03b2. Therefore, the subtraction of this quantity does\nnot affect the behavior of \u03a8(r, \u03c6) inside the wedge (where\nit still satisfies the Laplace equation). At the same time,\nthe redefined \u03a8(r, \u03c6) satisfies the required boundary condition for \u03c6 = 0, \u03b2. The new term leads to the following\nadditional terms in v\u03c6 and vr :\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nX\n4\u03a9r \uf8f0\n\u03c0\n1\nv\u03c6 (r, \u03c6) \u2192 v\u03c6 (r, \u03c6)\u2212\nsin(n\u03c0\u03c6/\u03b2) \u2212 \uf8fb ,\n\u03c0\nn\n4\nn>0, n odd\n\n(2.28)\n\n\u221e\n1\n1X1\nG(r, \u03c6; r , \u03c6 ) = \u2212\n\u03c0 n=1 n 1 \u2212 (b/a)2n\u03c0/\u03b2\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nn\u03c0/\u03b2\nr<\n\n\u2212\n\nwhere again the first term in the right side is the previous\nresult, in this case Eq (2.23b). The added quantity is\nzero at all points inside the wedge, and is equal to \u03a9r for\n\u03c6 = 0, \u03b2, so that the required boundary conditions for\nthese values of \u03c6 are now satisfied. The equation for vr\nbecomes\n\nvr (r, \u03c6) \u2192 vr (r, \u03c6) +\n\nX\n\ncos(n\u03c0\u03c6/\u03b2). (2.29)\n\nn>0, n odd\n\nThe new term, added to Eq. (2.23a), cancels the \"offending\" second term in Eq. (2.26), so that the re-defined vr\nsatisfies the required boundary condition at r = a.\nA similar problem with boundary conditions is also\npresent in the solution given in Ref. [1] for the velocity\nfield inside a cylinder with a rectangular cross section.\nThe expression for the stream function given in Eq. (62)\nof Ref. [1] does not in fact satisfy the required boundary\nconditions posed there at all points on the boundary. As\nin the case considered here, this does not affect the results\nfor the calculated physical quantities in Ref. [1], and this\nmathematical problem can be cured by the addition of a\nterm similar to the one considered above.\nThe above calculations can be modified readily to treat\na superfluid confined in the annular region between two\nconcentric arcs with radii a and b (a > b). The Green's\nfunction in this case has the form\n\nb2n\u03c0/\u03b2\nn\u03c0/\u03b2\n\nr<\n\n2\u03a9r\n\u03b2\n\n!\n\n\u00d7\n\n1\nn\u03c0/\u03b2\n\nr>\n\nn\u03c0/\u03b2\n\nr>\n\u2212 2n\u03c0/\u03b2\na\n\n!\n\nsin(n\u03c0\u03c6/\u03b2) sin(n\u03c0\u03c6\u2032 /\u03b2). (2.30)\n\nIn this case one does not have to worry about the behavior as r \u2192 0. Asymptotic series in the summations over n\nare again encountered and handled as in the preceding case. Using this in Eq. (2.19), the stream function \u03a8(r, \u03c6),\nand from it, the radial and tangential components of the velocity are obtained. We skip the long expressions for these\nquantities and quote the final result for the moment of inertia about the origin:\n\u0014 2\n\u0015\nX\n16a4\n1\nxn + 4\n2xn\n1\n2 xn\n4\n2xn\n4\nISF = IRO \u2212\n.\n{(1 + c )(1 + c ) \u2212 4c c } (2.31)\n(1 \u2212 c ) \u2212 2\n\u03b2\nx2n (x2n \u2212 4) 2(x2n \u2212 4)\nxn \u2212 4 1 \u2212 c2xn\nn>0, n odd\n\nHere, xn = n\u03c0/\u03b2, c = b/a, and IRO = \u03b2(a4 \u2212 b4 )/4 is\nthe moment of inertia for rigid-body rotation. We have\nchecked that this expression reduces to that in Eq. (2.24)\nfor b = 0, and to that in Eq. (2.18) for \u03b2 = 2\u03c0. In\nFig. 5, we show results for the NCRI in an annular wedge,\nas obtained from Eq. (2.31). The plots are the same\nas in Fig. 3 except that now we have c = 0.5, in other\nwords, the fields are as in Fig. 1. Again, the fractional\nsuppression is larger, as it must be, in the COM and it\nexhibits a maximum as a function of \u03b2.\n\nThe results derived above have a direct relevance to\ntorsional oscillator experiments on solid 4 He [2, 7] in\nwhich the helium is confined in the annular region between two concentric cylinders and the NCRI is measured\nboth in the presence and in the absence of a barrier that\nprevents flow around the annulus. If the NCRI in the\nabsence of the barrier is due to superflow along a closed\nchannel surrounding the rotation axis (the common axis\nof the inner and outer cylinders), then the measured value\nof the NCRI when the barrier is not present should be\n\n\f11\nR = ISF /IRO for narrow annular wedges with \u03b2 < 2\u03c0 is\nrather insensitive to \u03b2.

The NCRI in the presence of\nthe barrier should be given by (\u2206I)closed = \u03c1s (IRO \u2212ISF )\nwhere, if this channel is approximately circular, ISF is\nthe moment of inertia of a blocked superfluid ring calculated above. Thus, the ratio R\u2032 \u2261 (\u2206I)closed /(\u2206I)open\nshould be equal to (IRO \u2212 ISF )/IRO = 1 \u2212 R, where\nR \u2261 ISF /IRO depends (see Eq. (2.18) and Fig. 2) on\nthe value of c = b/a. If the superfluid component were\ndistributed homogeneously throughout the sample, then\na and b would be the outer and inner radii of the annular cell. Whether this is the case can be determined\nby comparing the experimentally measured value of R\u2032\nwith (1 \u2212 R0 ), where R0 is the value of R obtained from\nEq. (2.18) using these values of a and b. If the superfluid\nis instead confined in a channel (or in several separate\nchannels) with width substantially smaller than that of\nthe annular cell, then R\u2032 should be smaller than (1 \u2212 R0 )\nbecause R increases as the width of the ring is decreased\n(see Fig. 2).\nIn the experiment of Ref. [2], a = 0.75 cm and b =\n0.64 cm, so that (1 \u2212 R0 ) = 0.00817. The experimental value of R\u2032 is 0.015 which is within a factor of two\nof (1 \u2212 R0 ) but, surprisingly, it is higher. However, the\nvalue of (\u2206I)open appropriate for the blocked cell was\nevaluated from the results of a different experiment using another cell, so that the quoted value of R\u2032 may not\nbe very accurate. Also, a value of R\u2032 larger than (1 \u2212 R0 )\nmay be rationalized by assuming that the sample contains a large number of narrow superfluid channels, most\nof which do not form closed paths around the annulus\n(i.e. have \u03b2 < 2\u03c0). These \"naturally blocked\" channels\nmake small contributions to the net sample NCRI. These\ncontributions are not strongly affected by the imposition\nof the external barrier, which can change the value of \u03b2\nfor the channels it intersects: our calculation shows that\n\nMore recently, both (\u2206I)open and (\u2206I)closed have been\nmeasured using the same cell [7]. In this experiment, two\ncells, both with a = 0.794 cm and b = 0.787 and 0.745 cm\nwere used. In both cases the NCRI in the blocked configuration was found to be smaller than the resolution of the\nexperiment. This is consistent with our calculated values\nof (1 \u2212 R0 ) which are 2.9\u00d710\u22125 and 1.3\u00d710\u22123, respectively. Although the measurements are not sufficiently\naccurate to provide more detailed information about the\nchannels of superflow, it is clear that more accurate measurements of R\u2032 for samples with different a and b, combined with the results of our calculations, would be very\nuseful for elucidating the geometry of superfluid channels\nin solid 4 He.\nIf the superfluid channels are very narrow, the validity of the hydrodynamic description used here (and elsewhere [2]) might be questioned. However, recent numerical studies [10, 11] indicate that the diameter of the superfluid region near the core of a dislocation and the\nwidth of the superfluid layer along a grain boundary are\nof the order of a few nanometers (\u223c 10 interparticle spacings). These values of the superfluid layer width are likely\nto be lower bounds, since superfluid channels of such\nsmall lateral dimensions can not explain the relatively\nlarge superfluid density measured in recent torsional oscillation experiments [7]. It has been suggested [23] that\nthe effective lateral dimension of the superfluid region\nnear a crystalline defect may be larger due to a kind of\n\"proximity effect\", as in superconductors. Also, studies [24] of the thermodynamics of a system of interacting vortex lines in type-II superconductors, which can be\nmapped to the zero temperature quantum mechanics of a\ntwo-dimensional system of interacting bosons, show that\nthe width of grain boundaries can exceed 15-20 interparticle spacings in some cases. A hydrodynamic description should be valid if the width of the typical superfluid\nregions is of order \u223c 10 interparticle spacings or more:\nthis has been well-established quantitatively in several\nnumerical studies of the flow properties of classical liquids through narrow channels [25, 26]. The same should\nto be true for superfluid 4 He because its coherence length\nis very small.\nA related effect that needs to be considered if the superfluid channel along a crystal defect is very narrow is\nthe modulation of the density of the superfluid due to the\npotential arising from the surrounding crystalline region.\nWe expect our calculations to be valid in the presence\nof such density modulations because the hydrodynamic\nequation for a rotating superfluid derived (for low angular speed) in a recent study [27] in which superfluidity\nis assumed to coexist with a periodic modulation of the\ndensity (Eq. (8) of Ref. [27]) is identical to that used in\nour calculation.\n\n\f12\nD.\n\nFormation of vortices in a wedge with \u03b2 > \u03c0\n\nAs noted above, the velocity field obtained from a calculation in which it is assumed to be irrotational exhibits\na divergence as r \u2192 0 for a wedge with \u03b2 > \u03c0. Thus vc\nmust be exceeded near r = 0, implying that either there\nis a region of normal fluid near the tip of the wedge, or\na vortex is present in the system. As we have indicated,\nthis issue is unimportant in the torsional oscillation experiments because the region of normal fluid near the tip\nwould be unobservably small for experimentally relevant\nparameter values. It is, however, interesting to inquire\nabout the behavior in the general case. We show here\nthat this divergence in the velocity field is eliminated by\n\nvr (r, \u03c6) =\n\nvr0 (r, \u03c6)\n\n\u221e\n\u03ba X n\u03c0/\u03b2\n+\nr\n\u03b2r n=1\n\n1\nn\u03c0/\u03b2\n\nrv\n\nwhere vr0 (r, \u03c6) is the curl-free result as given by\nEqs.

(2.33) is \u03be = [ 4 + \u03b7 2 \u2212\u03b7]/2, where,\n\u03b7\u2261\n\n8\u03a9a2\n> 0.\n\u03ba(4 \u2212 \u03c0 2 /\u03b2 2 )\n\n(2.34)\n\nthe introduction of a single vortex.\nFrom symmetry, the vortex must be located along the\nline \u03c6 = \u03b2/2. Let the position of the vortex be (rv , \u03b2/2).\nThe presence of a vortex of circulation \u03ba(= h/m, where\nh is Planck's constant and m is the mass of a particle of the fluid) at (r\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ) leads to an additional term,\n\u03baG(r, \u03c6; r\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ) in the expression for the stream function\n\u03a8(r, \u03c6) where G(r, \u03c6; r\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ) is the Green's function given\nin Eq. (2.21) (see Section 3 of Ref. [1] for a derivation\nof this result). This additional term in \u03a8(r, \u03c6) (with\nr\u2032 = rv , \u03c6\u2032 = \u03b2/2) leads to the following additional term\nin the expression for the radial component of the velocity\nnear r = 0:\n\nn\u03c0/\u03b2\n\nrv\n\u2212 2n\u03c0/\u03b2\na\n\n!\n\ncos(n\u03c0\u03c6/\u03b2) sin(n\u03c0/2) \u2261 vr0 + vr1 ,\n\n(2.32)\n\nOne sees that \u03be has the nice property that 0 < \u03be < 1 for\nany value of \u03b7. The value of \u03be changes from 1 to 0 as\nthe dimensionless parameter \u03b3 \u2261 \u03a9a2 /\u03ba increases from\nzero to a large value, i.e. the vortex moves inward from\nthe rim of the wedge to its tip as the angular velocity\nincreases.\nUsing the expressions for the radial and tangential\ncomponents of the velocity in the presence of a vortex,\nthe total angular momentum of the superfluid can be\ncalculated. The presence of the vortex increases the angular momentum about the origin by the amount Lv and\nthe moment of inertia for rotation about the origin by\nIV = LV /\u03a9.

Since the vortex position rv depends on\nthe angular speed \u03a9, the value of IV also depends on \u03a9.\nAlthough the divergence in the velocity field at small r\nis eliminated by the introduction of a vortex, the free energy of the state with this vortex is not necessarily lower\nthan that of the vortex-free state with a small region\n\nof normal fluid near r = 0. Specifically, in experimental situations (e.g. in experiments on solid 4 He discussed\nabove) where the dimensions of the region of normal fluid\nare extremely small, the free energy cost of creating the\nnormal region is negligible and the free energy cost of\ncreating a vortex is the deciding factor in determining\nwhether a vortex will be present.

(2.30)\nand r\u2032 is the vortex position with coordinates r\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 . From\nsymmetry considerations \u03c6\u2032 = \u03b2/2 and the equilibrium\nradial position of the vortex, r\u2032 = rv , is to be determined\nfrom free energy minimization. The velocity field and the\nangular momentum in the presence of a vortex can be\nreadily obtained from the stream function of Eq.

The results depend on the\nvortex core size, via the logarithmic dependence on a/\u03b1\n\n\f14\n1.2\n0.8\n0.4\n\ny/a\n\nmentioned above. One then minimizes F1 with respect\nto r\u2032 to obtain its optimal value rv , and compares F1\nand F0 to find the overall equilibrium state. This depends on the value of \u03a9 and, for sufficiently small \u03a9, it\nis the vortex-free state, while for \u03a9 > \u03a91 the one-vortex\nstate first becomes favorable. In practice these calculations can be done only numerically, but the computations\nare not difficult. The relevant dimensionless parameter is\nthe quantity \u03b3 = \u03a9a2 /\u03ba defined in the preceding section.\nThis parameter is the ratio of the characteristic scale, \u03a9a,\nof the velocity field v0 due to the rotation alone, and the\nscale of the additional velocity field v1 due to the vortex,\nwhich is \u03ba/a. One needs also to input the value of \u03b1/a\nfor which we take the physically reasonable value of 107\nappropriate for liquid 4 He.\nResults for \u03a91 computed for a blocked annular ring\n(\u03b2 = 2\u03c0) are given in Fig. 6. There we plot the critical value of \u03b3 vs the aspect ratio c. We see that at\nreasonably small or intermediate values of c the critical\nvalue of \u03b3 is in the range 10-50 corresponding to angular\nspeeds in the general range of 10\u22121 /s, which is in the\nexperimentally relevant region. At large values of c this\nquantity increases, reflecting that the system is behaving\nmore like a rigid body, in which case the formation of vortices is obviously less favorable. A similar trend was seen\nfor progressively flatter ellipsoids in Ref. 1. This implies\nthat one need not worry about the formation of vortices\nin narrow blocked rings and wedges while estimating the\ncontribution of these objects to the NCRI of the system.\nIn Fig. 7, we show the texture of the velocity field v1\ndue to the nucleated vortex alone at c = 0.5 and at a\nvalue of \u03b3 slightly higher than its critical value, which at\nthis value of c is \u03b31 \u2243 20 (see Fig. 6). The calculated\noptimal position of the vortex at these values of \u03b3 and\nc is rv /a = 0.74. This position is marked by a (blue)\ncircle in the plot. The fields in this figure should be\ncombined with those in the top panel of Fig. 1. One\nshould recall that both plots are in arbitrary units, so\nthat before plotting the combined field one should divide\nthe fields in Fig. 7 by \u03b3 \u2243 20 to take into account their\noverall smaller relative scale. If that were done, however,\nthen the plot would be very hard to distinguish with the\nnaked eye from that in the top panel of Fig. 1.\nThe moment of inertia of a ring in the presence of a\nnucleated vortex may be calculated from Eqs. (2.37) and\n(2.38). The results deviate from those obtained for the\nvortex-free state only by a correction of order 1/\u03b3. For\n\u03a9 \u2265 \u03a91 this is therefore significant only at small values\nof c. At c \u2192 0 we find for example that, at \u03b2 = 2\u03c0, the\nmoment of inertia of a blocked wedge (c = 0) increases by\nabout 8.3% as a vortex is nucleated at \u03a9 = \u03a91 , and the\nincrease in the moment of inertia due to the nucleation\nof a vortex becomes less than 1% for c \u2265 0.33.\nThe optimal value, rv , of the radial coordinate of the\nvortex obtained from free-energy minimization is quite\ndifferent from the value for which the velocity due to\nthe vortex cancels the mathematical singularity at r = 0\nfound in wedges with \u03b2 > \u03c0. This implies that the veloc-\n\n0\n\u22120.4\n\u22120.8\n\u22121.2\n\u22121.2 \u22120.8 \u22120.4\n\n0\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n1.2\n\nx/a\nFIG. 7: (Color online) Fields produced by a nucleated vortex in an obstructed ring with c = 0.5, at \u03a9 = \u03a91 . Only\nthe fields produced by the vortex are included. Its position\n(marked by a (blue) open dot) is at the optimal value (see\ntext) rv /a = 0.74. The total flow is the sum of that shown\nin this figure, weighed by a factor of 1/\u03b3, and that in the top\npanel of Fig. 1. Because \u03b3 is rather large, the result would be\nhard to distinguish from that shown in Fig. 1.\n\nity field would formally diverge at r = 0 in such systems\neven when a vortex is present at the position corresponding to the minimum of the free energy. As noted above,\nthis mathematical singularity does not have any physical\nconsequence in usual experiments on 4 He. However, this\ninterplay between the requirements of keeping the velocity below the Landau critical value and minimizing the\nfree energy may lead to nontrivial behaviors in other experimentally accessible situations such as Bose-Einstein\ncondensates in cold atomic systems.\n\nIII.\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\nWe have calculated here the velocity fields of a superfluid sample in a cylindrical wedge, or ring-wedge geometry. We have used two different methods to solve the\nrelevant hydrodynamic equations both in the absence of\nvortices and when vortices are present. From the resulting velocity fields, we have derived formulas for the\nmoment of inertia, and therefore for the NCRI effect in\nthese geometries.\nPhysically, the most important of our results is that\nthe NCRI effect is most prominent for relatively narrow\nrings. Our calculations show that the moment of inertia\nof a blocked narrow ring is very close to the rigid-body\nvalue unless the width of the ring is a large fraction of\nits outer radius. Since the moment of inertia of a superfluid ring for rotation about its center is zero when\nit is unblocked (at least for small \u03a9), one should see a\nconsiderable change in the NCRI when approximately\ncircular superfluid channels in a sample are obstructed\nor unobstructed. The fractional change in the moment\n\n\f15\nof inertia as a ring is unblocked (defined relative to the\nmoment of inertia of the ring for rigid-body rotation) is\nmaximum when the rotation axis passes through the center of the ring. In that case, this ratio approaches unity\nvery quickly as the aspect ratio c of the ring is increased\ntoward one (see Fig. 2, top panel), and this ratio has a\nvalue close to 0.44 as c \u2192 0. The magnitude of the change\nin the rotational inertia upon blocking/unblocking does\nnot depend on the location of the axis of rotation. For a\nfixed value of the outer radius a, the magnitude of this\nchange is maximum when the aspect ratio c is close to\n0.52 (see Fig. 2, bottom panel). This maximum is very\nbroad. For an annular superfluid wedge, the moment of\ninertia about an axis passing through its tip is close to\nthe rigid-body value if the opening angle \u03b2 is small, and\nit decreases as \u03b2 is increased (see Figs. 3 and 5).\nThe results summarized above are for the case where\nthere are no vortices, so that the velocity field is irrotational. Since one expects vortices to be nucleated as the\nrotational speed in increased, we have used a free-energy\ncriterion to determine the critical angular speed for the\nnucleation of a vortex in the system. We find that in\nstandard \"supersolid\" experiments the relevant range of\ngeometries and speeds includes both the parameter region where vortices are absent and that where nucleated\nvortices exist. For a fixed value of \u03b2 = 2\u03c0 (ring geometry), the critical angular speed increases rapidly as the\naspect ratio c is increased above about 0.5 (see Fig. 6).\nAlso, the increase in the moment of inertia due to the\nnucleation of a vortex is rather small (less than 10%) in\nall cases. These observations imply that the results men-\n\ntioned above for a narrow ring without vortices remain,\nfor 4 He, valid for relatively large values of the angular\nvelocity.\n\n[1] A. L.

There are a number of technical difficulties in the calculation of the velocity fields,\nleading to non-convergent series and singularities. However, the singularities are integrable and the series are\nBorel summable, so that there is no difficulty in calculating physical quantities such as the angular momentum\nand the kinetic energy. We also point out the occurrence of a mathematical singularity in the velocity field\nin wedges (but not in rings) with \u03b2 > \u03c0 and discuss possible effects of this divergence. This singularity turns out\nto have no measurable consequence in experimental studies of 4 He, but may be relevant in studies of cold atomic\nsystems confined in wedge-shaped traps.\nIn general, the ideas and methods developed here can\nbe used in other geometries. We believe that the results\nand techniques presented here can be very useful in understanding not only NCRI phenomena in \"supersolid\"\nhelium, but also superflow in confined geometries and in\nfinite systems. Work in which we apply these ideas to\nstudy the NCRI effect in realistic models of grain boundary networks is in progress.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported in part by NSF (OISE0352598) and by DST (India).\n\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n\n\f16\n[26] A.
