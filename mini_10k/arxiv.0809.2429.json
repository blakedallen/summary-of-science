Introduction\nDouble-negative metamaterials (DNMs) refer to artificially patterned metal-dielectric\nstructures having simultaneously negative effective permittivity \u03b5eff and effective permeability\n\n\u03bceff.. Owing to their unique physical properties and the fascinating applications [1, 2, 3] that can\nnot be accessed in naturally-occurring materials, DNMs have attracted much attention within the\nscientific and engineering communities since the results of Pendry, Smith, and coworkers [4, 5].\nHowever, compared with engineering DNMs at larger wavelengths such as at microwave region,\nobtaining optical DNMs (particularly optical magnetism) is still a difficult task. As the\nelectromagnetic (EM) properties of the metals at microwave region and at optical region are\nrather different, there exists a physical limitation on achieving magnetism at high frequencies by\nsimply downsizing the microwave DNM elements such as split-ring resonators [6]. Nevertheless,\nthe constituent units of optical DNMs generally involve nano-scaled features, which also bring in\nfabrication challenges.\nIn the optical region metallic nanostructures are often referred to as plasmonic structures\ndue to their ability to support surface plasmon excitations. This feature has been extensively used\nin designing optical metamaterials. A common approach is based on the excitation of the\nsymmetric and asymmetric plasmon resonances in the paired elements, such as arrays of metallic\nnano-rod pairs [7, 8] and paired perforated metal films [9,10,11], to obtain electrical and\nmagnetic response of the structure, hence the DNMs. However, the antiresonant behaviour of the\nmaterial parameters originating from the periodicity of the structure [12] increases the difficulty\nin overlapping the frequency bands of magnetic and electric resonances in those structures.\nWhile some authors suggested that such a limitation could be overcome by combining\ncontinuous metal film(s) with arrays of paired elements [13, 14], the complexity involved in such\n\n2\n\n\fstructures implies that the realization of the designs is a rather challenging task. On the other\nhand, Shvets et al. [15, 16] have proposed that a metal-dielectric composite consisting of closelypacked plasmonic inclusions can also generate strong magnetic activity leading to a modified\nmagnetic permittivity \u03bceff \u22601 when the frequency of operation approaches the higher-multipole\nplasmonic (electrostatic) frequency of the inclusions. In this manuscript we present a new design\nof a single-layer optical DNM based on this approach. The building element of structure is a\nsubwavelength metallic inclusion with stepwise modulations which act as strong scatters to\nexcite higher-order multipole electrostatic resonance. Double-negative behaviour of the structure\noccurs in the spectral range where these higher-order modes dominate over the dipole mode.\nThis design may open up a simple alternative for experimental implementation of a DNM since\nit involves only one patterned metallic layer.\n\n2. Structure Design\nThe structure consists of a single layer of 2D periodic metallic inclusions in the x-y plane.\nThe inclusions have a finite thickness h, which is much smaller (h < 100 nm) than the\nwavelength of the incident light \u03bb, along the z-direction. A schematic of the unit cell\nconfiguration (top view) is shown in Fig. 1. The basic element of the unit cell is a rectangular\nprism whose dimensions in the x-y plane are labeled as wo and lo; some stepwise modulations,\nwhose dimensions are indicated as w1, w2 and w3 along x-direction and l1, l2 and l3 along ydirection, are then introduced on both sides of this elementary rectangular unit to function as\nstrong scatterers to produce higher-multipole plasmonic resonances for achieving a magnetic\nresponse. The characteristics (spectral position and strength) of the resonances are mainly\ngoverned by the shape of the inclusions due to its electrostatic nature, which offers great\nflexibility in tuning the effective parameters of the structure. While we use a three-step3\n\n\fmodulation design to demonstrate the concept in this manuscript, the number of modulation steps\ncan be introduced to the system are not restricted to the three steps shown in Fig. 1.\n\n3. Simulation Results\nA rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) [17] based commercial grating analysis tool,\nG-Solver [18] was used to calculate the complex transmission and reflection coefficients, t and r,\nof the structures. The incident light has electric component Ex and magnetic component Hy; the\nlight propagates along the z direction. Both the incident and outgoing media are air. The material\nfor the inclusions was assumed to be Ag and its complex dielectric constants were taken from\nRef. [19]. After obtaining t and r, the complex refractive index n and impedance Z of the\nstructure were calculated from [20]\n\ncos(nko h) =\n\nand\n\n1\u2212 r 2 + t 2\n2t\n\n(1 + r ) 2 \u2212 t 2\nZ=\n,\n(1 \u2212 r ) 2 \u2212 t 2\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere ko is the propagation number of the incident light in free space and h is the thickness of the\nmedia; and the effective \u03b5 and \u03bc were then retrieved using\n\n\u03b5 = n Z and \u03bc = nZ .\n\n(3)\n\nThe EM properties of the structures were first analyzed by examining the effects of\ndifferent geometric parameters of the inclusion, such as the thickness of the structure h, the\nnumber of modulation steps and the dimensions of each step, on the effective n, \u03b5 and \u03bc of the\n\n4\n\n\fsystem; the results were then used to optimize the arrangement of the system to obtain a doublenegative feature and the highest possible value of the figure-of-merit \u2212Re{n}/Im{n}.\nFig. 2 show the simulation results for one of the optimized designs whose geometric\nparameters are listed in Table 1. The results reveal two key characteristics of the structure: the\nlowered electron plasma frequency \u03c9p of the metal (\u03b5 = 0 at \u223c 820 nm wavelength); and\nsimultaneously negative \u03b5 and \u03bc at the wavelengths around 1100 nm to 1130 nm. Fig. 2a reveals\nthat around the wavelength corresponding to \u03c9p, the structure has very high transmission\nefficiency; when moving towards the longer wavelength side of the spectrum, it shows the metallike behaviour (highly reflective). A shoulder in the transmission curve occurs at the wavelengths\nbetween 1100 nm to 1150 nm and the transmission falls rapidly beyond this region, which\ncoincides with the double-negative characteristics (hence the negative refractive index) of the\nstructure in this spectral region: the transmitted light exhibits a negative phase velocity when\npropagating through a negative refractive medium, and the destructive interference between the\nincident and the transmitted light will cause a sharp decrease in the transmission around the\nnegative index region. The phenomenon has also been observed experimentally [10].\nMeanwhile, the real part of the impedance has a peak whereas the imaginary part shows a\nmodulation (Fig. 2b) in this region. As a result of better impedance matching between the\nstructure and the surrounding medium (air), a sharp dip in the reflection appears. Figure 2c\nshows that the real part of \u03b5 exhibits some oscillations at 1000 nm to 1300 nm, which indicates\nthe excitation of certain plasmon resonances within the structure; nevertheless, the effective \u03bc of\nthe structure show a strong modulation in this spectral region. As shown in Fig. 2d, the real part\nof \u03bc ranges from \u22122.3 to 3.6. Furthermore, similar as reported in other designs of DNMs [12], in\n\n5\n\n\fthe spectral range where the magnetic resonance occurs, the imaginary part of \u03bc also becomes\nnegative over a narrow spectral region.\nOwing to the existence of double-negative behaviour, the designed structure has very low\nlosses in negative index region. As displayed in Fig.3, the real part of n has a minimum value of\n\u2013 4.6, and the highest value of \u2212Re{n}/Im{n} reaches 4.2 at \u03bb = 1150 nm, which is rather\nattractive for future physics experiments and application development.\nTo verify the origin of the double-negative behaviour observed in the single-layer\nplasmonic structure, we analyzed its near-field distribution using a finite element method (FEM)\nbased commercial software package (COMSOL Multiphysics). Fig. 4 shows the electric and\nmagnetic field distributions across the center of the structure (z = 1\u20442 h plane) at the magnetic\nresonance (\u03bb = 1126 nm, Re{\u03bc} = \u2013 2.3). Clearly, the Ex component of the electric field and Hy\ncomponent of the magnetic field arise from the light scattered by the stepwise modulations\npresented on the inclusion. The field distributions of Ex and Hy both show quadrupole resonance\nprofiles, which suggests that the double-negative behaviour of the structure was produced by the\nhigher-order multipole electrostatic resonance.\nWe would also like to point out that in RCWA method used to perform the spectral\nanalysis is based on the (finite) Fourier series expansion of the EM fields and material\npermittivity, which are solutions to Maxwells equations, inside the corrugated region. For highly\nconducting periodic inclusions it generally requires a high number of Fourier components to\nobtain accurate results [21]. However, for the calculations of 2D metallic gratings, G-Solver\nappears to be highly unstable as the number of orders increases. Therefore, the number of orders\nretained in the calculation here were restricted to 2 in order to obtain meaningful results.\nConsequently, the amounts of uncertainty existing in these results remain unclear at this stage\n\n6\n\n\fand more reliable simulation codes need be developed in the near future. Nevertheless, we note\nthat the physical effects predicted from RCWA simulations have been confirmed independently\nusing FEM techniques (which are unwieldy for performing the spectral calculations directly), so\nwe have some confidence that the behaviour of these new structures is at least qualitatively\ncorrect.\n\n4. Discussion and Conclusion\nWe have shown that it is possible to realize an optical DNM using a single-layer plasmonic\nstructure. The simultaneously negative \u03b5eff and \u03bceff of the structure is a result of the excitation of\nhigher-order multipole electrostatic resonances initiated by the strong scatters presented in the\nstepped subwavelength metallic inclusions. The approach offers great degrees of freedom in\ncontrolling of the EM properties of the structure. As these resonances are electrostatic in nature,\ntheir properties can be tailored by varying the shape of the inclusions. This approach could open\nup a new means of realizing low-loss optical DNMs with great engineering simplicity.\n\nReferences\n1. Veselago, V.
