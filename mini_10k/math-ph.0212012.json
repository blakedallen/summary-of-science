The interferences of X rays that are diffracted by different atoms\nare indeed linked to the relative positions of these atoms. If the atoms form a lattice, as in\nideal crystals, then the diffraction pattern consists in sharp peaks. Quasicrystals, discovered\nin 1982 by Shechtman et al. [15], have the same kind of diffraction pattern, but they are\nnot periodic. That raises the question of understanding which kind of atoms distribution\nproduces a diffraction pattern consisting in sharp peaks.\nIn Section 1, we recall some results about locally finite sets and uniformly discrete sets,\nand we define some pseudo-metrics on the space of uniformly discrete sets. Section 2 collects\nsome known results about almost periodicity. In Section 3, we recall the mathematical\nformalism of diffraction, and we state our characterization of pure point diffraction in terms\nof almost periodicity. As an application, we treat in Section 4 the example of deformed\nmodel sets.\n\n1\n\nLocally finite sets and uniformly discrete sets\n\n1.1\n\nLocally finite sets\n\nFollowing [16], we define a metrics d on the set M\u03c3 of locally finite subsets of Rn , by\no\nn \u221a\n\u2032\n\u2032\nd(S, S ) = min 1/ 2, inf D(S, S ) ,\n\nPostal address: Universit\u00e9 Claude Bernard Lyon 1, LaPCS, B\u00e2timent B, Domaine de Gerland, 50, avenue\nTony-Garnier F-69366 Lyon Cedex 07, France.

If K is a compact\nsubset of Rn , define\nF K = {S \u2208 M\u03c3 : S \u2229 K = \u2205}.\nIf O is an open subset of Rn , define\n\nFO = {S \u2208 M\u03c3 : S \u2229 O 6= \u2205}.\nThen, T is also the topology generated by the union of the two families F K , K compact,\nand FO , O open.\nFor t \u2208 Rn let Tt : M\u03c3 \u2192 M\u03c3 denote the translation defined by\nTt (S) = S \u2212 t = {x \u2212 t : x \u2208 S}.\nTranslations are homeomorphisms of M\u03c3 . We now define a \u03c3-algebra A on M\u03c3 . For A \u2282 Rn ,\nlet NA : M\u03c3 \u2192 N \u222a {\u221e} denote\nNA (S) = card(A \u2229 S).\n\n(1)\n\nThe \u03c3-algebra A on M\u03c3 is generated by the family of maps NA , for every Borel setA, or,\nequivalently, for every compact set A. Note that A is also the Borel \u03c3-algebra of (M\u03c3 , T ).\n\n1.2\n\nUniformly discrete sets\n\nA set S \u2208 M\u03c3 is uniformly discrete with parameter r > 0 if two different points of S are\nat least at distance r. The set Ur of such S \u2208 M\u03c3 inherits the metric structure of (M\u03c3 , d).\nThe space (Ur , d) is compact.\nWe now define a new topology on Ur , by specifying various uniformly equivalent pseudometrics that induce this topology. These pseudo-metrics are connected to Besicovitch pseudometrics on spaces of functions defined by formulae of the kind\n1\ndB (f, g) = lim sup\nR\u2192\u221e |BR |\n\n\u0012Z\n\nBR\n\np\n\n|f \u2212 g| )\n\n\u00131/p\n\nwhere BR is the ball of radius R of Rn centered at the origin and |BR | its volume.\nIf S \u2208 M\u03c3 , its upper density is defined by\ndens (S) = lim sup\nR\u2192\u221e\n\n1\ncard(S \u2229 BR ).\n|BR |\n\nFinally, call a set A \u2282 Rn relatively dense if there exists M > 0 such that each ball of Rn of\nradius M meets A.\n2\n\n\f\u2022 The pseudo-metrics d.

Define\n\b\nd(S, S \u2032 ) = min r/2, inf(D(S, S \u2032 )) .\nc\n\n\u2022 The pseudo-metric d . For S, S \u2032 in Ur , define\nZ\n1\nc\n\u2032\nd (S, S ) = lim sup\nd(S \u2212 t, S \u2032 \u2212 t)dt.\nR\u2192\u221e |BR | BR\n\u2022 The pseudo-metric df . Let f : Rn \u2192 R be continuous with support in Br/5 . We assume\nthat f is not everywhere equal to 0. Notice that the function\n(\n(Ur , d) \u2192 R\nS\n7\u2192 \u03bcS \u2217 f (0),\nP\nwhere \u03bcS = x\u2208S \u03b4x , is continuous, and that, for all u \u2208 Rn , \u03bcS \u2217 f (u) = \u03bcS\u2212u \u2217 f (0). For S\nand S \u2032 in Ur , define\nZ\n1\n\u2032\n|\u03bcS \u2217 f (u) \u2212 \u03bcS \u2032 \u2217 f (u)|du.\ndf (S, S ) = lim sup\nR\u2192\u221e |BR | BR\nWe prove the following proposition:\nc\n\nProposition 1.1 The three functions d, d and df define translation invariant pseudometrics. These pseudo-metrics are uniformly equivalent. Therefore, they define the same\ntopology and the same Cauchy sequences.\nc\n\nTo show the uniform continuity of the identity map from (Ur , d ) to (Ur , df ), we use and\nprove the following, stronger, result:\nLemma 1.2 Let H : (Ur , d) \u2192 R be continuous. Then, for all \u03b5 > 0, there exists \u03b7 > 0\nc\nsuch that, for every S and S \u2032 in Ur such that d (S, S \u2032 ) \u2264 \u03b7,\nZ\n1\n|H(S \u2212 t) \u2212 H(S \u2032 \u2212 t)|dt \u2264 \u03b5.\nlim sup\n|B\n|\nR\u2192\u221e\nR\nBR\nWe get the following result:\nProposition 1.3 The quotient space of Ur by the pseudometric d is a complete metric space.\n3\n\n\f2\n\nAlmost periodicity\n\nLet E be a Banach space, and f : Rn \u2192 E. For t \u2208 Rn , let ft be defined by ft (x) = f (x \u2212 t).\nThe function f is said to be Bohr almost periodic if, for all \u03b5 > 0, the set\nP\u03b5 = {t \u2208 Rn : kf \u2212 ft k\u221e < \u03b5}\nis relatively dense (see for example [10]).\nThe following result is classical and proved in a more general context in [3, 6, 14].\nTheorem 2.1 Let \u03bc be a finite measure on Rn . Then, the two following assertions are\nequivalent:\n1. The function \u03bc\nb is Bohr almost periodic.\n2. The measure \u03bc is purely atomic.\n\nThis can be extended to classes of unbounded measures (see for example [4]). The following\nresult, which is an easy consequence of Theorem 2.1, is sufficient for our purposes:\nTheorem 2.2 Let \u03bc be a positive, tempered and positive definite measure on Rn . Let f be a\nSchwartz function from Rn to C such that fb(x) > 0 for all x \u2208 Rn . Then, the two following\nassertions are equivalent:\n1. \u03bc \u2217 f is Bohr almost periodic.\n2. \u03bc\nb is purely atomic.\n\nWe need the following extension of the definition of almost periodicity. Let (X, d0 ) be a\npseudometric space. We consider an action of Rn on X such that\n1. For all t \u2208 Rn , x 7\u2192 x \u2212 t is an isometry.\n2. For all x \u2208 E, t 7\u2192 x \u2212 t is continuous.\nSay that x \u2208 X is almost periodic if, for all \u03b5 > 0, the set\n{t \u2208 Rn : d0 (x \u2212 t, x) \u2264 \u03b5}\nis relatively dense. For x \u2208 E, let Ox = {x \u2212 t, t \u2208 Rn }. Recall that A \u2282 E is totally\nbounded if, for all \u03b5 > 0, A can be covered by a finite number of balls of radius \u03b5 centered\nat points of A. Recall that:\nTheorem 2.3 The point x is almost periodic if and only if Ox is totally bounded.\n\n4\n\n\f3\n\nDiffraction\n\n3.1\n\nGeneralities\n\nWe now recall the mathematical formalism of diffraction theory, following Hof [7]. Let\nS \u2208 M\u03c3 . For a given R > 0, we define the measure \u03b3R by\n!\n!\nX\nX\nX\n1\n1\n\u03b4\u2212x .\n(2)\n\u03b4y\u2212x =\n\u03b4x \u2217\n\u03b3R :=\n|BR | x,y\u2208S\u2229B\n|BR | x\u2208S\u2229B\nx\u2208S\u2229B\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nThus, \u03b3R represents the relative positions of the points of S \u2229 BR . Physically, the Fourier\ntransform of \u03b3R corresponds with the diffraction pattern: \u03b3c\nR (t) is the luminous intensity\ndiffracted in the direction t by a material whose atom centers are the points of S \u2229 BR .\nIf it exists, the limit \u03b3 in the vague topology as R \u2192 \u221e of the measures \u03b3R is called\nthe unique autocorrelation of S. This measure is tempered and its Fourier transform \u03b3b is a\npositive measure, called the diffraction measure of S.\nWe prove the following lemma:\n\nLemma 3.1 Let \u03c8 : Rn \u2192 R be continuous and nonnegative with compact support. Assume\nthat the integral of \u03c8 is equal to 1. If f : Rn \u2192 R is continuous with compact support, let\nHf : M\u03c3 \u2192 R be defined by\nX\nHf (S) =\n\u03c8(x)f (y \u2212 x).\nx,y\u2208S\n\nThen, the restriction of Hf to (Ur , d) is continuous. Let \u03b3 be a positive and locally finite\nmeasure on Rn . Then, \u03b3 is the unique autocorrelation of S \u2208 M\u03c3 if and only if, for all\nf : Rn \u2192 R continuous with compact support,\nZ\n1\nHf (S \u2212 t)dt \u2212\u2192 \u03b3(f ), R \u2212\u2192 \u221e.\n|BR | BR\nZ\n1\nHf (S \u2212 t)dt converges\nTherefore, S admits a unique autocorrelation if and only if\n|BR | BR\nfor all f continuous with compact support.\nLet Ar denote the set of all the elements S of Ur with a unique autocorrelation. Lemmas\n3.1 and 1.2 yield:\nProposition 3.2 The set Ar is a closed subset of (Ur , d).\n\n3.2\n\nPatterson sets\n\nFollowing [8], S \u2208 Ar is a Patterson set if its diffraction measure is purely atomic (actually,\n[8] also requires S to be relatively dense). A Patterson set is a mathematical idealization of\na quasicrystal.\nUsing Theorem 2.2, we prove the following result:\n5\n\n\fTheorem 3.3 Let S \u2208 Ar with unique autocorrelation measure \u03b3. The following assertions\nare equivalent:\n1. S is a Patterson set.\n2. b\n\u03b3 is purely atomic.\n\n3. For all R > 0 and \u03b5 > 0, the set {t \u2208 Rn : \u03b3(t + BR ) \u2265 \u03b3(0) \u2212 \u03b5} is relatively dense.\n4.

For all \u03b5 > 0, the set t \u2208 Rn : dens \u2206\n\nTheorem 3.3 and Proposition 3.2 yield\n\nCorollary 3.4 The Patterson sets form a closed subset of (Ur , d).\nHere is a corollary of Theorem 3.3:\nCorollary 3.5 Let S \u2208 Ar with unique autocorrelation measure \u03b3.\n1. If, for all \u03b5 > 0, the set\n{t \u2208 Rn : \u03b3(t) \u2265 \u03b3(0) \u2212 \u03b5}\n\nis relatively dense, then S is a Patterson set. The converse is true if S \u2212S is uniformly\ndiscrete.\ne where de is the pseudo-metric defined by\n2. If S is almost periodic in (Ur , d),\ne S \u2032 ) = dens (S\u2206S \u2032 ) ,\nd(S,\n\nthen S is a Patterson set. The converse is true if S \u2212 S is uniformly discrete.\nThe first point of Corollary 3.5 is proved in [1]. In that paper, the point sets can be weighted\nsubsets of a locally compact Abelian group. The sufficient condition for being a Patterson\nset given by the second point of Corollary 3.5 is proved in [16] under unique ergodicity\nassumptions.\n\n3.3\n\nPoint processes\n\nA point process [12, 13] is a measurable map \u03c7 from a probability space (\u03a9, F , P) to (M\u03c3 , A).\nA point process \u03c7 is uniformly discrete if there exists r > 0 such that \u03c7 takes its values in\nUr . A point process is (square) integrable if, for every compact set A, the random variable\nNA defined by (1) is (square) integrable. A point process is stationary if its law is invariant\nunder the action of the translations (Tt )t\u2208Rn . Let \u03c7 denote a stationary and integrable point\nprocess, and \u03b3R denote the random measure associated with \u03c7 by (2). The Palm measure of\n\u03c7 is the measure Pe on (M\u03c3 , A) defined by\n!\nX\n1\nPe(F ) :=\nE\n1F (\u03c6 \u2212 x) ,\n|B|\nx\u2208\u03c7\u2229B\n6\n\n\ffor F \u2208 A, where B is a fixed Borel subset of Rn whose Lebesgue measure |B| is finite and\nstrictly positive, see [12]. This definition does not depend on B.\nLet B(Rn ) denote the Borel \u03c3-algebra of Rn . If m is a measure on (M\u03c3 , A), its intensity\nI(m) is the measure on (Rn , B(Rn )) defined by\nZ\nI(m)(A) = card(\u03c6 \u2229 A) dm(\u03c6), A \u2208 B(Rn ).\nThe following result is proved in [5]:\nTheorem 3.6 Let \u03c7 be a stationary ergodic and square integrable point process on Rd . Let\nJ be the (deterministic) intensity of the Palm measure of \u03c7. Then, J is locally finite and for\neach bounded Borel set A in Rn ,\nlim \u03b3R (A) = J(A) a.s.\n\nR\u2192\u221e\n\nIn particular, \u03c7 admits a.s. J as a unique autocorrelation measure.\nActually, we can prove the following result:\nTheorem 3.7 Let \u03c7 be a stationary and uniformly discrete point process on Rn , and J the\nintensity of its Palm measure. If Jb is purely atomic, then \u03c7 is a.s. a Patterson set. The\nconverse is true if \u03c7 is ergodic.\nUsing Theorem 2.2, we prove the following result:\n\nTheorem 3.8 Let \u03c7 be a uniformly discrete and stationary point process, and J the intensity\nof its Palm measure. The following assertions are equivalent:\n1. Jb is purely atomic.\n\n2. For all R > 0 and for all \u03b5 > 0, the set\n{t \u2208 Rn : J({0}) \u2212 J(BR + t) \u2264 \u03b5}\nis relatively dense.\n\n3. For all R0 > 0, there exists R in ]0, R0 [ such that, for all \u03b5 > 0, the set\nn\n\u0010\n\u0011\no\nt \u2208 Rn : P {\u03c7 \u2229 BR 6= \u2205} \u2206 {(\u03c7 \u2212 t) \u2229 BR 6= \u2205} \u2264 \u03b5\nis relatively dense.\n\n4. There exists G a generating subset of A such that, for all A \u2208 G and for all \u03b5 > 0, the\nset\n{t \u2208 Rn : P (A \u2206 (A + t)) \u2264 \u03b5}\nis relatively dense.\n7\n\n\f5. For all A in A and for all \u03b5 > 0, the set\n{t \u2208 Rn : P (A \u2206 (A + t)) \u2264 \u03b5}\nis relatively dense.\n6. For every square integrable f on M\u03c3 , \u03c6f : t 7\u2192 ft is Bohr almost periodic.\n7. The dynamical system (M\u03c3 , P, (Tt )t ) admits a discrete spectrum.\nRelated results are proved in [9] under finite local complexity assumptions. See also [16].\nCorollary 3.9 Let \u03c7 be a uniformly discrete and stationary point process, and J the intensity of its Palm measure. If, for all \u03b5 > 0, the set\n{t \u2208 Rn : J({t}) \u2265 J({0}) \u2212 \u03b5}\nis relatively dense, then Jb is purely atomic. The converse is true if the support of J is\nuniformly discrete.\n\n4\n\nExample: deformed model sets\n\nIn this section, we provide an example of application of our results. Deformed model sets are\nstudied in [2]. Let E and F be two linear subspaces of Rn such that Rn = E \u2295 F . If x \u2208 Rn\nwe write x = xE + xF with obvious notations. We denote by BRE (resp. BRF ) the closed\nball of E (resp. F ) centered at the origin and of radius R. Let | * |F denote the canonical\nLebesgue measure on F . We assume that E contains a vector v whose coordinates are\nlinearly independent over Q. Let W be a fixed bounded Borel subset of F . Let g : W \u2192 E be\nuniformly continuous. Let Tn = Rn /Zn denote the n dimensional torus, and \u03c6 : Tn \u2192 P(E)\nbe defined by\n\u03c6(u) = \u03c8((E + W ) \u2229 (u + Zn )),\nwhere \u03c8 : E + W \u2192 E is defined by\n\u03c8(z) = zE + g(zF ).\nFor all t \u2208 E, \u03c6(u \u2212 t) = \u03c6(u) \u2212 t. We use the vector space E to define Ur as in Section 1,\nand we assume that there exists an r > 0 such that\n\u03c6(Tn ) \u2282 Ur .\nThen, \u03c6 is measurable from Tn endowed with its natural Borel \u03c3-algebra to (Ur , A).\n\n8\n\n\f4.1\n\nDeterministic results\n\nIn this subsection, we assume that |\u2202W |F = 0. We prove the following lemma:\nLemma 4.1 The map \u03c6 : Tn \u2192 (Ur , d) is continuous on the complementary of a set of\nvanishing Haar measure.\nWith that lemma the following results are simple consequences of the uniform ergodicity\nof Ur under the action of the translations (Tt )t\u2208E .\nProposition 4.2 For any continuous H : (Ur , d) \u2192 R and any S \u2208 \u03c6(Tn ),\nZ\nZ\n1\nH(S \u2212 t)dt \u2192\nH(\u03c6(u))du, as R \u2192 \u221e.\n|BRE | BRE\nTn\nMoreover, the above convergence is uniform with respect to S \u2208 \u03c6(Tn ).\nProposition 4.3 Let S = \u03c6(u) and S \u2032 = \u03c6(u\u2032 ). Then\nZ\nc\n\u2032\nd (S, S ) =\nd(\u03c6(u + t), \u03c6(u\u2032 + t))dt.\nTn\n\nProposition 4.4 The map \u03c6 is continuous from Tn to (Ur , d).\nFrom Proposition 4.2 and Lemma 3.1, all sets S \u2208 \u03c6(Tn ) admit a unique autocorrelation.\nFrom Proposition 4.4, \u03c6(Tn ) is totally bounded in (Ur , d). From Theorem 2.3, every S in\n\u03c6(Tn ) is almost periodic. Using Theorem 3.3, one finally gets:\nTheorem 4.5 All sets in \u03c6(Tn ) are Patterson sets.\n\n4.2\n\nProbabilistic results\n\nWe do not assume any more that |\u2202W |F = 0. The function \u03c6 defines a stationary and\nuniformly discrete point process. For every Borel subset A \u2282 Tn and for every \u03b5 > 0, the set\n{t \u2208 E : |A \u2229 (A \u2212 t)| \u2265 |A| \u2212 \u03b5}\nis relatively dense, where | * | is the Haar measure on Tn . Hence, \u03c6 fulfills Assertion 5 of\nTheorem 3.8. Using Theorem 3.7, one finally gets:\nTheorem 4.6 For almost all u \u2208 Tn , \u03c6(u) is a Patterson set.\n\n9\n\n\fReferences\n[1] Michael Baake and Robert V. Moody.
