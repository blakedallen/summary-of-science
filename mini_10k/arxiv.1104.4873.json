The PE chain in that figure are our model for the DNA polyelectrolyte molecule. We use two kinds of PE models for the anionic bonded segment consisting of monomers of\ncharge zP . The first model has finite monomer charge zP = \u221212 where the distance between adjacent monomers\nis b = 20.4 \u00c5 and the second model has zP = \u22121 with b = 1.7 \u00c5. These models have the same line charge\ndensity \u03b4l = zP /b. These models have the same radius and charge density as the B-DNA chain [1]. The hard\ncore radii of the DNA monomer is 8 \u00c5 and the soft core radii is 2 \u00c5. For the temperatures set in the simulation,\nthe effective DNA radius can be taken as 10 \u00c5 because of the strength of the soft core repulsive potential which\nis effective over a distance of 2 \u00c5. Clearly we can observe oscillations at the RDF of the first model which does\nnot appear in the second model. Thus the choice of the magnitude of the finite charge assigned to a model\nclearly affects the surrounding particle distribution. The degree of change of the RDF profiles with changing\ncharge magnitude is very significant. In order to monitor these significant changes, here we focus on the simple\nmodel of an infinitely long charged rod where initially we focus charges being discrete and uniformly distributed\nalong the rod. From the solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE) for the continuous (non-discrete)\ncharge distribution of a charged rod, we can in at least two ways from the potential of the uniformly charged\nrod determine the potential field for a rod consisting of discrete charges. For a given (line) charge density \u03b4l ,\nthe charge magnitude and intermolecular distance are arbitrary. In order to achieve the above results, we first\nprovide a theoretical analysis and continue with the numerical solution of the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann\nequation (PBE) for this rod model. To substantiate our theoretical analysis, we perform molecular dynamics\n(MD) simulation of this rod model of discrete charges which is surrounded by a salt solution.\nFrom the potential of a discretely charged rod, we determine theoretically the particle RDF about the rod.\n\u03c1s\n= gf is the ratio of the number\nThe method utilizes the Boltzmann factor gf (r) = exp( \u2212zs e\u03c8(r) ) where \u03c1s,\u221e\nkB T\ndensity of particle s at a distance r over the bulk number density; \u03c8(r) is the potential of average force [2].\nThis study is a first step in developing a model of calculating the general potential due to a discrete charge\ndistribution enclosed by a boundary of arbitrary geometry. A principal motivation in attempting to provide a\nrigorous theory is due to the general tendency of workers to assume that the dimensions and parameters chosen\nfrom physical considerations for simulations is a fair representation of reality [3]; Our work shows that these\nchoices are rather arbitrary and possibly inaccurate, which warrants a separate study of the connection between\nmolecular size and the general potentials, since any one average potential of force \u03c8(r) uniquely determines the\nRDF profiles.\n\n2\n\nTheoretical Approach and Numerical Solution of PBE\n\nIn the following we proceed to determine the non-uniform electric field distribution on a cylindrical Gaussian\nsurface surrounding a charged rod. Then we relate it to the potential \u03c8(r) and the particle distribution g(r).\n\n\f2.1\n\nNonuniform Electric Field Around a Charged Rod\n\nFig. 1 shows an array of charges (closed circles) along the rod axis. The rod is extended to infinity to the\nleft and right. A test charge c (open circle) lies at a perpendicular distance r to the rod axis. We start by\ndetermining the net electric field at point c due to the rod charges. For the moment, we assume no interference\nof counterion charges. We use bold letters to denote vectors and italic letters to represent its magnitude. In\ngeneral, the first subscript in our variables refers to the left (value 1) half of the diagram and the subscript with\nvalue 2 refers to the right half of the same. The second subscript denotes the charge index along the rod in the\nappropriate direction indicated by the first subscript.\nThe angle \u03b1j is the angle between the rod axis and a straight line from the point c to the left part of the\ny\u2032\n\ny\n\nE\nE1\nE2\nx\u2032\n\nc\n\nb\n\n\u03b8\n\n\u03b1j\n\nr2,1\n\nr1,1\n\nr1,j\n\nr2,j\n\nr\n\nb\n\nb\n\nx\n\n\u03b11\np\n\nb\n\n\u03b21\ns\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\n\u03b2j\nb\n\nb\n\nFigure 1: The electric fields experienced at the point c (open circle) with a distance r normal from the polyelectrolyte\nrod axis.

E1,j is the electric field at point c contributed by the j th charge on the left of the rod. Analogous to\n\u03b1j and E1,j , the angle \u03b2j and electric field E2,j pertains to the angle and electric field for right part of the rod.\nIn Fig. 1, if r1,1 denotes the distance between the test charge c and the nearest rod charge on the left side, p is\nthe projection of the r1,1 line to the rod x axis. Similarly, s is the projection of the line r2,1 to the rod axis on\nthe right hand side and s = (b \u2212 p). For later use, we define\npj = p + (j \u2212 1)b\nsj = (b \u2212 p) + (j \u2212 1)b\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nBelow is the net electric field (in cgs unit) E1 due to the charges on the left.\nE1 =\n\n\u221e\nX\nj=1\n\nE1,j =\n\n\u221e\nX\nzP \u02c6\u2032\n2 r 1,j ,\nr\nj=1 1,j\n\n(3)\n\n\fwhere r\u0302\u2032 1,j is the unit vector from the j th charge to the test charge c and zp is the magnitude of the discrete\ncharges, or the total charge of a continuously charged rod over distance b. The prime coordinate are centred\non test charge c, whereas the unprimed coordinates refer to the rod axis, where the zero for x is arbitrary, and\nthe zero for the y coordinate is located on the rod.

Dy is determined numerically by extending j to a\nlarge number (\u223c 5, 000) until no change is observed.

The degree of variation diminishes as the perpendicular distance r increases.\nFigure 5 graphs the |Dx (p)| = Ex /\u0112 for model A and model B.

Since D = Dx2 + Dy2 (from (19-21)) the contribution of Dy to D is\nvery much larger compared to the Dx contribution.\nIn the following we propose a model when the counterion and salt ions are included in the system containing\nan infinitely charged rod. If the discrete rod charges along the rod axis have equal axial charge distance b, the\nionic distribution about any two tangential plane that are equivalent by symmetry must be the same. We note\nthat the D function i not affected by the counterion about the rod. Hence we may couple D to the effective\ndielectric constant that arise from the water and ionic distribution about the rod to relate E and \u0112,.\n\n\f2.2\n\nMultigrid Method for Solving the PBE\n\nFor some simple and symmetric shapes (e.g. plate, cylinder or sphere), the PBE expressions are well-known in\ntheir second order differential equation forms. The linearized PBE known as the Debye-Huckel approximation\nprovides an analytical expressions that holds only for low potentials. As far as the second order differential\nform of the PBE is concerned, most solutions need to be found numerically. In this work we solve the PBE for\nboth the continuous and discrete charged rod model. The potential for the continuous model will be used as a\nmeans to obtain the potential of the discretely charged rod by methods described in the two next subsections.\nFor a continuous charged rod, the PBE is expressed as\n\u2202 2 \u03c6\u0304(r) 1\n+\n\u2202r2\nr\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202 \u03c6\u0304(r)\n\u2202r\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2212\n\nn\nX\n\nAs exp(\u2212zs \u03c6\u0304(r)) = 0,\n\n(25)\n\ns=1\n\nwhere \u03c6\u0304(r) = e\u03c8\u0304(r)/kB T is the reduced potential and As = \u2212e2 zs \u03c1s,\u221e /(\u01ebkB T ). The Neumann boundary\nconditions are obtained by applying Gauss' law at the rod-counterion contact distance r = rp = (aP + rcion )\nand r = rc as follow\n\u2202 \u03c6\u0304(r = aP + rcion )\nzP e2\n=\u2212\n\u2202r\n\u01eb2\u03c0(aP + rcion )bkB T\n\u2202 \u03c6\u0304(r = rc )\n=0 ,\n\u2202r\n\nand\n\n(26)\n(27)\n\nwhere aP is the rod radius and rcion is the counterion radius. zP is the magnitude of the individual charge of\nthe rod in the discrete case or the total charge contained within a distance b (for continuous rod). The cylinder\ncell radius rc is determined by a non-local macroscopic rod charge density \u03c1Zrod (per unit volume). where\n\u03c1ZRod =\n\nZRod\nVSimulation box\n\n=\n\nZRod\nVCylinder PBE box\n\n,\n\n(28)\n\nwhere ZRod is the total charge of the rod in one simulation box; VSimulation box = LBox 3 is the cubic simulation\nbox volume with simulation box length LBox which is set (see Section 4). Since the length of the charged rod\n(with total charge ZRod ) in one simulation box equals LBox , the length of the cylindrical PBE per ZRod charge\nalso equals LBox . Thus\n1\n\n1\nor\n2\nL\nLBox\nBox \u03c0rc\nr\n1\nrc =\nLBox\n\u03c0\n3\n\n=\n\n(29)\n(30)\n\nThe second boundary condition (Eq. (27)) is applied for at least three reasons. First, at large distances from the\nrod axis, the potential is about constant implying zero potential gradient. Second, due to charge neutrality of\nthe cylindrical box, theoretically the surface charge density equals zero at the box surface leading to zero electric\nfield. Third, the systems studied in the theoretical PBE are substantiated by simulations utilizing the periodic\nboundary condition (PBC). If the same model like PBC is applied in PBE calculation, there is a mirroring\nshape of the potential between two neighboring boxes (in the PBE calculation). We assume that our simulation\nbox is large enough to warrant (27).\nThe multigrid method applied in this research uses the Full Approximation Storage (FAS) procedure described\nin [6]. The outline of the algorithm for our application is given in Appendix A based on a slight modification\nof the equations used in the code given in [7] which was developed on the basis of reference [6]. The way we\ndiffer follows. Reference [7] uses another equation, and not (25). Further, the code in [7] is in 2-D with uniform\nand equal number of grid for both axes, whereas ours is both in 1 and 2-D where in 2-D the number of grid\nfor both axes can be different; [7] uses the Newton-Gauss-Seidel method for the smoothing procedures and we\nutilize the globally convergent Newton-Raphson and conjugate gradient method. Another difference is [7] uses\nthe Dirichlet boundary conditions, whereas we use the Neumann boundary conditions. Oberoi, et al., [8] and\nHolst, et al., [9] have also used multigrid methods to obtain the solution of the PBE. We had examined the\nuniqueness of the PBE solution by supplying different initial conditions that led to the same final solution. The\nconvergence criteria is taken when the residual Euclidean norm of (25) is zero. Computationally, the iterations\nfluctuate about zero and we choose a tolerance number (\u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 ) of this norm that define our numerical\nsolution. The physical variables used for our theoretical PBE calculations are exactly the same as for our MD\nsimulations, so that the results from MD may be compared to the theoretical model. The detail of the physical\nvariables of the MD systems and the theoretical models are given in Section 4.\n\n\f2.3\n\nObtaining the Potential About a Discretely Charged Rod\n\nAfter examining the electric field around the rod axis, we relate it to the potential. Often, the scalar potential is\nthe starting point for analysis and we adopt this route. We propose two methods to determine the non-uniform\npotential around a discretely charged rod. Both methods require the potential data around a continuously\ncharged rod (\u03c6\u0304). The first method directly modifies the \u03c6\u0304 by using the electric field distribution function D.\nThe second method require us to perform 2D-PBE with boundary conditions specified in terms of \u0112 and D.\nFor the first method (method I), we initially compute \u03c6\u0304 of points (i, j) where index i refers to the x axis and j\nfor the r axis, where the x grid distance are uniform, as with the r grid distances, but they need not be equal\nin length interval. The details of the solution for \u03c6\u0304 was detailed in the previous section, where Eq. (25) plays\na pivotal rule. The solutions are determined for all (i, j) in (x\u0304, r\u0304) space. We then determine a relationship\nbetween \u03c6 and \u03c6\u0304 (Eq. 38). We then form a grid (i, j) in (x, r) space which is exactly the same as (x\u0304, r\u0304) space.\nWe then compute \u03c6 over the grid (i, j) using our solutions for \u03c6\u0304, where for solution at grid (i, j) we require \u03c6\u0304\nat {(i, j \u2212 1)(i, j)(i, j + 1)}.\nFor method II, we also construct an (i, j) grid over (x, r) space. We then determine the values of \u03c6\u0304 at the\ngrid boundaries. We also require the derivatives of \u03c6\u0304 at this boundary which corresponds to the von-Neumann\nboundary conditions. We then use these boundary condition values to compute the 2-D PBE over a grid in\n(x, r) space where Eq. (42) is solved. Subsection 5.1 details the consistency of these two approach.\n2.3.1\n\nMethod I: Modifying the Potential of a Continuously Charged Rod\n\nThe starting point is the Poisson equation (mks unit)\n\u03c1(r\u2032 )\n,\n\u01eb\n\n\u2207 * E(r\u2032 ) =\n\n(31)\n\nwhere \u03c1(r\u2032 ) is the charge density at r\u2032 and \u01eb dielectric constant. The coordinate (r\u2032 ) where the electric field\nE(r\u2032 ) and charge density \u03c1(r\u2032 ) occur are outside the rod volume. We then assume the \u01eb at the medium outside\nthe rod is constant (r\u2032 independent). If we denote \u03c1 as the charge density around a discretely charged rod and\nsimilarly \u03c1\u0304 for the continuous charged rod, then\n\u03c1(r\u2032 )\n\u2207 * E(r\u2032 )\n=\n\u03c1\u0304(r\u2032 )\n\u2207 * \u0112(r\u2032 )\n\n(32)\n\nIn cylindrical coordinate\n1\n\u2207*E =\nr\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202(rEr )\n\u2202r\n\n\u0013\n\n1\n+\nr\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202E\u03b8\n\u2202\u03b8\n\n\u0013\n\n+\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202Ex\n\u2202x\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(33)\n\nThe y axis in Fig. 1 is identical with the coordinate r in cylindrical coordinate. We will use the r symbol to\nrepresent the coordinate at \u03b8 = 0 in cylindrical coordinates. Therefore any arbitrary point r\u2032 (31) is a function\nof r, \u03b8 and x.

(42) is a partial differential equation with independent variables r and x. In the x direction, the integration\nis performed over x \u2208 [0, 1/2b] because \u03c6(r, x) is symmetric and periodic. We define a small rectangular plane\nABCD (Fig 7) with plane width AB = CD = 1/2b. The plane length BC = AD = rc \u2212 rp , where rc is the\ncylindrical box radius and rp is the closest contact distance between the rod axis and the counterion center.

To solve the potential solution within the ABCD, we specify the Neumann\nboundary conditions at the edges of the ABCD plane.

One possibility to obtain \u0112(r) is to\ncalculate the potential gradient of \u03c6\u0304(r) by numerical differencing. Thus before we find the potential solution\nof a discretely charged rod, first we need to obtain the potential of the equivalent continuously charged rod to\ndefine the boundary conditions.\n\n3\n\nCalculating the Mean Radial Distribution Function (RDF) from\nthe Potential Data\n\nAt this point we assume that we have been able to obtain the potential at any point around a charged rod. We\nthen compare a potential-related property, which is the radial distribution function, obtained from simulation\nand calculation. Radial distribution function gs,s1 (r\u2032 ) = \u03c1\u0303s,s1 (r\u2032 )/\u03c1s,\u221e measures ratio of the average to bulk\ndensity of particle s at radial distance r\u2032 from the central particle s1 . In this article, the central particle is the\nrod charge and the surrounding particles are the counterion and salt. As such we suppress the s1 subscript and\nonly retain the s label.\nSince the potential from the cylindrical PBE is a function of the perpendicular distance r to the rod axis and\nr\n(r, x)\n\nr\u2032\nb\n\nr\nx\n\nx\nb\n\n\u03b8\ndx\n\nFigure 8: Radial distance r \u2032 of a finite rod charge (closed circle).

The density is isotropic over \u03b8 coordinate,\nthus we can exclude the \u03b8 dependency. The surface area integration of (47) follows the formula for a sphere.\n(47) then becomes\n\u2032\n\n\u03c1\u0303s (r ) =\n\n2\u03c0r\u2032\n\nR r\u2032\n\n\u03c1s (r, x)dx\n.\n2\u03c0(r\u2032 )2\n0\n\n(48)\n\nHowever, there is one difference between the calculation of bulk concentration of ions in PBE system and\nsimulation. In PBE, the rod volume is not a space that is accessible to ions, thus the bulk density of ions is\ncalculated by\nNs\n\u03c1PBE\n,\n(49)\ns,\u221e =\nVBox \u2212 VRod\nwhere Ns is the total number of ion s, VBox is the box volume and VRod is the rod volume.\nIn simulation, the calculation of the ionic bulk density involves the whole box volume. So the bulk density of\n\n\fion s is\n\u03c1Sim\ns,\u221e =\n\nNs\n,\nVBox\n\n(50)\n\nwhere the definition of Ns and VBox are similar with (49).\nThe \u03c1\u0303s (r\u2032 ) in (48) is the source of the theoretical g(r\u2032 ) that will be compared to the simulation g(r\u2032 ). Thus\n\u2032\n\u03c1\u0303s (r\u2032 ) = \u03c1Sim\ns,\u221e g(r ) .\n\n(51)\n\n0n the other hand, the local density \u03c1s (r, x) in (48) is the data from PBE calculation, so that\n\u03c1s (r, x) = \u03c1PBE\ns,\u221e gf (r, x)\n= \u03c1PBE\ns,\u221e exp(\u2212zs \u03c6(r, x)) ,\n\n(52)\n\nwhere gf has been defined for the PBE in the introduction. Substituting \u03c1\u0303s (r\u2032 ) and \u03c1s (r, x) in (51) and (52) to\n(48), we then have\nZ \u2032\n1 r PBE\n\u2032\nSim\n\u03c1\nexp(\u2212zs \u03c6(r, x))dx\n(53)\n\u03c1s,\u221e g(r ) = \u2032\nr 0 s,\u221e\nSim\nSince \u03c1PBE\ns,\u221e and \u03c1s,\u221e are constant, (53) reduces to\n\n1\ng(r ) = \u2032\nr\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\nr\u2032\n\nexp(\u2212zs \u03c6(r, x))dx\n\n0\n\n\u03c1PBE\ns,\u221e\n\u03c1Sim\ns,\u221e\n\n.\n\n(54)\n\nFrom (49) and (50), since the total number of particle Ns is conserved in our scheme, we have \u03c1PBE\ns,\u221e (VBox \u2212\nVRod ) = \u03c1Sim\nV\n.\nSo\n(54)\nbecomes\ns,\u221e Box\ng(r\u2032 ) =\n\n1\nr\u2032\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nr\u2032\n\nexp(\u2212zs \u03c6(r, x))dx\n\nVBox\n.\n(VBox \u2212 VRod )\n\n(55)\n\nIf the rod volume is much smaller than the box volume (VRod \u226a VBox ), the term VBox /(VBox \u2212 VRod ) \u2248 1\nNumerical integration of (55) needs to be performed because there is no closed expression of \u03c6(r, x) which is\nnumerically computed from (38) and (42). We have used both in this presentation (i.e. Method I and Method\nII). The potential at any point (r, x) which is not exactly at one of the PBE solution points can be determined\nby interpolation. The interpolation method that is used in this work is either the polynomial or bicubic interpolation [7].\n\n4\n\nSimulation Part\n\nWe perform MD simulations for systems containing the rod model A and B (See Fig. 3) in different salt concentrations inside a cubic box. The rod dimension in the simulation box is made possible by making a cylindrical\nwall constraint. We fix the x and y of the rod axis in the middle of the simulation box (LBox /2, LBox /2), where\nLBox is the box length. The rod sides are extended in the z direction and the periodic boundary condition\napplied will make both ends of the rod at infinity. We set the simulation box length to 408 \u00c5 so that if the\nsimulation is for rod model A, the number of discrete charges for the rod in the primary simulation cell (box)\nis 408/20.4 = 20. For the simulations of rod model B, the number of discrete charges for the rod per simulation\nbox is 408/1.7 = 240. For both models, the total rod charges inside one simulation box is \u2212240. Salt ions are\nmodeled by spheres with radius 2 \u00c5 where the charge is +1 for Na+ and \u22121 for Cl\u2212 [13, 14]. The counterions are\nchosen to have equal charge and radial dimensions as for Na+ from the salt. We use the Langevin thermostat\nto maintain the system temperature at 300 K for the whole MD run. The Bjerrum length 7.13 is used as a\nparameter representing the continuum water solvent dielectric at this temperature.\nThe purely repulsive Lennard-Jones potential is applied to control the short-range repulsive potential. We set\nthe sum of the soft sphere radius (\u03c3LJ ) for the LJ interaction between the rod surface and ion to 0.1 \u00c5 implying\nthat the sum of the hard sphere radii equals 11.9 \u00c5. The rod-ion soft sphere interaction radii is chosen to be\nvery small to make the characteristic contact between ions and the rod surface as close as possible to the PBE\nboundary potential conditions. In PBE, the counterion cannot approach the rod axis at a distance that is\nsmaller than the the sum of their effective radii (12 \u00c5). We use the ESPResSo package to run the MD simulations [10]. The RDF data are generated by the usual dumping procedure after the system attains equilibrium.\n\n\f5\n\nResult and Discussion\n\nThe purpose of this work is to examine the consequence of modelling a bunch of charges as one single charge.\nThis is frequently carried out in simulation studies that are interested in the physical forces that determine\nthe particle distribution in complex systems [3]. In these studies, there is an underlying assumption that the\nsimplification of molecular charge distribution in their simulations has a minimal, if not insignificant effect on\nthe resulting general physical properties and distributions of the system. We explicitly show here that this tacit\nassumption needs to be reconsidered on the basis of Fig. 9.\nIn order to clarify this situation, we present first our numerical methodology, and will use these techniques in\nsubsequent writings where the PBE will be solved for a DNA polyelectrolyte with different monomer charge\nand size choices. Then, using our methodology, we can derive the RDF's theoretically and compare it with\nour simulation results. However, before this can be done, we need to ensure consistency of our method for\nsome model systems, the most amenable being for the continuous and discretely charged rods. We therefore\nstudy in depth these systems in what follows. It may be added that this particular approach of the solution\nto this very important problem in biophysics concerning charge distribution profiles by using a continuously\ncharged reference has not been attempted. The consistency of the result would imply that it is indeed a feasible\nmethodology for all problems related to temperature-dependent charge density distributions.\nAn example is when 12 (in number) independent charges in the DNA chain is simplified to a single charge, where\nthe chain dimension is conserved. We had mentioned in the introduction concerning Fig. 9, where simulation of\na linked spherical monomer representing the DNA chain results in the RDF being different when the monomer\nhas a discrete charge \u221212 and \u22121 with the chain dimension and line charge density being conserved for both\nchains. Here, instead of working with a linked monomer to simulate an array of charge, we use the simpler\nmodel which is the infinitely charged rod for rod model A and B. The dimension of the rods are illustrated\nin Fig. 3 (for model A and B) where the rod line charge density are the same for the PEs whose RDFs are\ndepicted in Fig. 9.\nIn what follows we present the potential around the discretely charged rods (for model A and B), as a results\n\n102\n\nCharge= \u221212 (first Model)\n\ngNa(r)\n\nCharge= \u22121 (second Model)\n\n101\n\n100\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\nDNA PE charge\u2212Na+ distance (r) (\u00c5)\n\nFigure 9: The RDF profile between the DNA polyelectrolyte charge and Na+ ions.

The details are discussed in the introduction.\n\nof the theoretical calculations utilizing method I and method II (subsection 2.3.1 and 2.3.1). From the potential\ndata, we then construct the theoretical RDF by using the procedure given in Section 3. The theoretical RDFs\nare then compared to the RDFs from MD simulation. The theoretical potential, theoretical RDF, and simulation\nRDF are studied for both rod models A and B.\n\n5.1\n\nPotential Data\n\nThe equipotential contour lines around the charged rod from the calculations of method I and method II are\nprovided (Fig. 10 and 11). From our numerical data, the potential profiles generated by method I and II are\nquantitatively the same within computational error suggesting that both methods are equivalent in the potential\ncalculation. Method I is computational cheaper than method II because method I only performs a root-finding\nprocedure at one particular point to obtain the potential at that point, whereas method II numerically calculates\nthe 2-D PBE simultaneously for all the points within the rectangular grid. It may be added that the boundary\nconditions in method II gives some insight regarding the potential profile within the boundary whereas method\n\n\fI cannot provide such insight.\n\n5.1.1\n\nMethod I\n20\n\n20\n\n\u03c6(x,r) = \u22125\n\u03c6(x,r) = \u22124\n\u03c6(x,r) = \u22123\n\n18\n\n\u03c6(x,r) = \u22125\n\u03c6(x,r) = \u22124\n\u03c6(x,r) = \u22123\n\n18\n\nr(\u00c5)\n\n16\n\nr(\u00c5)\n\n16\n14\n\n14\n\n12\n\n12\n\n10\n\n10\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\nx(\u00c5)\n(a)\n\n1.2\n\n1.6\n\nx(\u00c5)\n(b)\n\nFigure 10: Potential contour at a distance r perpendicular to a charged rod calculated by method I.

The two adjacent charges are at (x, r) = (0, 0) and (x, r) = (b, 0). The potential around rod model\nA varies and is symmetric. The largest absolute value of the potential around model A is at the nearest distance\nof approach of an ion to the discrete rod charge (at 12 \u00c5). In our simulation, the test charge has radius 2 \u00c5 and\nthe discrete charges of the rod all have radius 10 \u00c5 leading to 12 \u00c5 for the distance of closest approach.

The theoretical potentials about the discretely charged rod are calculated\nby method I (Subsection 2.3.1). The value 0.1; 10.0; 50.0 100.0 are the respective salt concentrations in\nmillimolar.\n\n\fwhich are not observed for rod model B. We define oscillations have to be smooth and wavy slope of the graph.\nOn the other hand the simulations also exhibits fluctuations in addition to the oscillations that occur in both.\nLittle oscillations that occur at the simulation RDF of the rod model A has exactly the same period as the\nPBE RDF. The coincidence suggests that the principal cause of these oscillations in the simulation RDF is the\nnonuniform potential distribution parallel and perhaps perpendicular to the rod axis. For low salt concentration, there is a disagreement between the height of the first peak of the simulation and calculated RDF, both\nfor rod model A and B. This disagreement reduces as the salt concentration increases. The height of the first\nRDF peak between the simulation for model A and B is also different. This difference, which also appears for\nthe RDF of DNA polyelectrolyte simulation in Fig. 9, indicates that the counterion distribution at the first\nlayer about the charges of rod model A is denser than for the rod model B.\nThe above discussions indicates that discrepancies can occur when simulating a bunch of charges as equivalent\nto one single charge.\n\n6\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have shown that the potential profile for model A and B is quite different, implying that criteria based\non theoretical modelling should be used in conjunction with MD simulations. Previously this aspect has been\nignored in detail and elaborate studies that might open to question the validity of the results and conclusions.\nMethod I and II generate identical results for the potential profile although the algorithms are entirely different.\nWe can therefore exploit these methods differently where one method might be more tractable than the other\nfor a particular systems. The theoretical and simulation RDF is in very good agreement, except at the first peak\nat low salt concentrations. We believe that the equations we solved are incomplete, especially in relation to the\nscreening effects that are not taken into account. Finally it cannot be overemphasized that theoretical criteria\nmust be adopted in choosing appropriate charge and size of the particles involved in the molecular system that\nis simulated.\n\n7\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nThis work was funded by the University (UM) grant UMRG-RG077/09AFR and Government grant FRGSFP084/2010A.\nA.A.J.A is grateful for a research assistantship from UM.\n\n\fA\n\nMultigrid method for solving the cylindrical PBE\n\nTo generate the potential data from (25), we apply the nested iteration multigrid method combined with the\nglobally convergent Newton method (GCNM) for the smoothing process. In some cases, solving (25) with\nrelaxation or shooting method cannot reach convergence. We also found that the GCNM offers better stability\nthan the nonlinear conjugate gradient method for the smoothing process. The code is largely derived from Press,\net al., [7], where we have modified the code, including replacing the original equation, the smoothing functions,\nand the boundary conditions (from Dirichlet to Neumann) in addition to expanding from 2-D calculation with\nequal number of grid for both axes to the 1-D and 2-D calculation where the number of grid at both axes can\nbe different.\nFollowing the notation in [7], we define L(u) (see Eq. (19.6.22) at Section 19 in [7]) as the source term for (25)\nsuch that\n\u0012 \u0013 X\ns\n\u2202 2 u 1 \u2202u\n+\nL(u) =\n\u2212\nAi exp(\u2212zi u)\n(56)\n\u2202x2\nx \u2202x\ni=1\n\nwhere u and x denote \u03c6(r) and r respectively.\nThe following is one of the modified portions of the file mgfas.c from (Press, et al., [7]). This C file is the driver\nfor the nonlinear multigrid code.\n========================\nfor(jj=j; jj>= 2; jj\u2212\u2212) { /* downward stoke of the V */\nrelaxGCNR(); /* GCNR (Smoothing function) */\n//relaxNLCG(); /* Non-linear Conjugate Gradient (Smoothing function)*/\n***\n***\n}\ndtmp1= iu[1][2];\nitmp1= renew continuity(); /* solve the coarsest grid solution */\nif(itmp1) printf(\"Coarsest grid solved, mid point %f \u2212\u2212 > %f\", dtmp1, iu[1][2]);\nelse iu[1][2] = dtmp1; /* no coarsest solution */\nfor(jj=2; jj \u00a1= j; jj++) { /* Upward stroke of V */\n***\n***\nrelaxGC NR();\n//relaxNLCG();\n}\nupdate neumannbc(); /* check and update at boundaries */\n========================\nFigure 14 depicts the potential solutions of (25) in different salt concentrations using the above method. We\nnotice that the potential rapidly converges to zero at higher NaCl concentrations, which is to be expected. The\nvon Neumann boundary conditions are also satisfied in the vicinity of the boundary.\n\n2\n1\n0\n\u22121\n\u03c6(r)\n\n0.1 mM NaCl\n\u22122\n10 mM NaCl\n\u22123\n100 mM NaCl\n\u22124\n\u22125\n\u22126\n\u22127\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nr (\u00c5)\n\nFigure 14: The PBE potential solutions around a continuously charged rod calculated by multigrid method. r is the\n\u22121\nperpendicular distance to the rod axis.
