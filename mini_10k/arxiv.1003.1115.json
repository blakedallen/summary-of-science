The relativistic blast wave is driven by an\n1\n2\n\nE-mail: uhm@iap.fr\n\nInternational Center for Astrophysics, Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute, Daejeon 305-348,\nKorea\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\n\"ejecta\", which is ejected by the central engine of the GRB explosion. As the ejecta interacts\nwith a surrounding ambient medium, two (forward and reverse) shock waves develop (e.g.,\nPiran 2004). The forward shock (FS) wave sweeps up the ambient medium, and the reverse\nshock (RS) wave propagates through the ejecta.\nAs the blast wave has high Lorentz factors 102 \u2212 103 (e.g., M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros 2006), the FS wave\nis highly relativistic and an equation of state (EOS) with a constant adiabatic index 4/3\nmay well describe the gas in the FS-shocked region. However, the strength of the RS wave\nvaries as the blast wave propagates. In the case of a constant-density ambient medium, the\nRS wave is initially non-relativistic and then transitions to a mildly relativistic or relativistic\nregime (Kobayashi 2000; Sari & Piran 1995). Thus, an EOS with a constant adiabatic index\nis not adequate for the gas in the RS-shocked region; a variable adiabatic index needs to be\nconsidered to account for change in the gas temperature.\nAlthough the EOS with a constant adiabatic index has been widely used in analytical\nand numerical studies of relativistic hydrodynamics, it is valid only for the gas of either\nnon-relativistic (with the index 5/3) or ultra-relativistic temperature (with the index 4/3).\nThe correct EOS for a relativistic ideal gas is formulated in terms of modified Bessel functions (e.g., Synge 1957), and its equivalent adiabatic index varies from 5/3 to 4/3 as the\ntemperature increases.\nAs it is not convenient to deal with modified Bessel functions, there has been effort to\nfind simpler EOSs that closely reproduce the correct EOS of a relativistic ideal gas. Taub\n(1948) showed that the choice of EOS is not arbitrary and must satisfy a certain inequality\n(Taub's inequality). By taking the equal sign in Taub's inequality, Mignone et al. (2005)\nderived a simple form of EOS that has correct limiting values 5/3 and 4/3.\nThe same EOS as in Mignone et al. (2005) was previously introduced by Mathews\n(1971), considering a relativistic \"monoenergetic\" gas where all particles have the same\nenergy. The validity of this EOS was addressed by Blumenthal & Mathews (1976) for the\ncases of both infinite mean free collision times and very short mean free collision times.\nThis EOS was also adopted by Meliani et al. (2004) and Mignone & McKinney (2007).\nIn particular, Mignone & McKinney (2007) demonstrated in their relativistic numerical\nsimulations that use of an EOS with a constant adiabatic index can significantly endanger\nthe solution when transitions from cold to hot gas (or vice versa) are present.\nWe use the same above EOS in this paper. Following Mathews (1971), we consider\na relativistic monoenergetic gas and show that it closely reproduces the correct EOS of a\nrelativistic ideal gas. Then we use this EOS to find a simple form of jump conditions for\nrelativistic hydrodynamical shocks. This simple set of jump conditions applies to shocks of\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\narbitrary strength.\nA short-lived RS was proposed to explain a brief optical flash (M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros & Rees 1999;\nSari & Piran 1999a, 1999b). A dynamical evolution of such a short-lived RS was studied\nanalytically by assuming an equality of pressure across the blast wave (Kobayashi 2000;\nSari & Piran 1995). The RS wave here is short-lived since the ejecta is assumed to have a\nconstant Lorentz factor. However, in general, the ejecta is expected to emerge with a range\nof the Lorentz factors. The shells with lower Lorentz factors will gradually \"catch up\" with\nthe blast wave as it decelerates. Thus, the RS wave is long-lived. Such a long-lived RS was\nstudied for a power-law ejecta by assuming a constant ratio of the two pressures at the FS\nand RS (Rees & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros 1998).\nIn this paper, we present a detailed description of our blast-wave modeling technique\nfor even more general class of explosions where the ejecta and the ambient medium have\nan arbitrary radial structure or stratification. More specifically, we study analytically the\nspherical expansion of such a stratified ejecta and find the trajectory of the RS wave through\nthe ejecta self-consistently. In order to find a dynamical evolution of the blast wave, we use\ntwo different methods: (1) customary pressure balance and (2) the \"mechanical model\"\n(Beloborodov & Uhm 2006).\nUsing a simple example model, we demonstrate that, although the customary assumption of pressure balance for the blast wave yields an estimated evolution, it is not rigorously\naccurate. In particular, the energy conservation is not satisfied for an adiabatic blast wave;\nthe total energy is decreased by a factor of 5 in the case of the example model.\nThe mechanical model was developed for relativistic blast waves, by relaxing the pressure\nbalance (or proportionality) and applying the conservation laws of energy-momentum tensor\nand mass flux on the blast between the FS and RS. Using the same example model, we\nshow that the energy conservation is satisfied for the mechanical model. We also show that\ndynamical evolutions found by the two methods differ significantly. Finally, we present the\nafterglow light curves in X-ray and optical bands. We compare two sets of light curves\ncorresponding to the two different dynamical evolutions mentioned above.\nIn Section 2, we derive a simple set of jump conditions for relativistic hydrodynamical\nshocks. In Section 3, we describe in detail our blast-wave modeling technique. We also\nprovide a simple method of evaluating the blast energy, employing a Lagrangian description\nfor the blast wave. In Section 4, we review the mechanical model including more detailed\nequations.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n2.\n\nRelativistic shocks\n\nWe consider a shock wave of an arbitrary strength. The preshock medium (cold) is\ndenoted by region 1, and the postshock medium (hot) by region 2. The gas moves at right\nangles to the surface of discontinuity (shock front). The rest-mass density \u03c1, the energy\ndensity e (including rest energy), and the pressure p of the gas are defined in the rest frame\nof each region. The energy-momentum tensor T \u03b1\u03b2 for a perfect fluid and the mass flux j \u03b1\nare given as\nT \u03b1\u03b2 = (e + p)u\u03b1 u\u03b2 + g \u03b1\u03b2 p\nand\nj \u03b1 = \u03c1u\u03b1 ,\n(1)\nwhere g \u03b1\u03b2 is the Minkowski metric, and u\u03b1 is the 4-velocity of the gas.\n\n2.1.\n\nJump conditions\n\nA shock is described by three jump conditions that express the continuity of mass,\nenergy, and momentum flux densities, respectively, in the shock frame (Landau & Lifshitz\n1959),\n\u03b32 \u03b22 \u03c12 = \u03b31 \u03b21 \u03c11 ,\n\n(2)\n\n\u03b322 \u03b22 (e2 + p2 ) = \u03b312 \u03b21 \u03c11 c2 ,\n\n(3)\n\n\u03b322 \u03b222 (e2 + p2 ) + p2 = \u03b312 \u03b212 \u03c11 c2 .\n\n(4)\n\nHere subscripts 1 and 2 refer to regions 1 and 2, and c is the speed of light. The Lorentz\nfactor \u03b3 of the gas for each region is measured in the rest frame of shock front, and thus\n\u03b2 = (1 \u2212 1/\u03b3 2 )1/2 is the gas velocity relative to the shock front. Note that we have set p1 = 0\nand e1 = \u03c11 c2 here since we assume that region 1 is cold.\nWe introduce a quantity \u03ba in writing an EOS for the relativistic gas in region 2,\np2 = \u03ba2 (e2 \u2212 \u03c12 c2 ).\n\n(5)\n\nWe use the quantity \u03ba instead of an adiabatic index, in order to avoid any confusion with\nthe Lorentz factors. Note that \u03ba2 is 2/3 for a non-relativistic shocked gas and 1/3 for an\nultra-relativistic gas. As mentioned in Section 1, we do not use a constant value for \u03ba2 . The\nquantity \u03ba2 here varies between 1/3 and 2/3 as the strength of the shock varies.\nWe solve these four Equations (2)-(5) algebraically. First, we define a compression\nratio a \u2261 \u03c12 /\u03c11 and get the relation \u03b312 = a2 (\u03b322 \u2212 1) + 1 by squaring Equation (2). Then,\nsubstituting \u03b312 and e2 (from Equation (5)) into Equations (3) and (4), we find the expressions\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nfor \u03b31 , \u03b32 , and p2 in terms of \u03ba2 and the compression ratio a,\n(a + 1)\n(a + 1)[a\u03ba2 \u2212 (1 + \u03ba2 )]2\n2\n,\n\u03b3\n=\n,\n1\na(1 \u2212 \u03ba22 ) + (1 + \u03ba2 )2\na(1 \u2212 \u03ba22 ) + (1 + \u03ba2 )2\n(a\u03ba2 )2 \u2212 (a\u03ba2 )(2 + \u03ba2 )\n,\np2 /(\u03c11 c2 ) =\n(1 + \u03ba2 )\n\n\u03b322 =\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nwhere we have used the fact that a(1 \u2212 \u03ba2 ) + (1 + \u03ba2 ) cannot be zero for a > 0 and 1/3 \u2264\n\u03ba2 \u2264 2/3. Equations (6) and (7) are exact.\nThe shock strength may be described by the relative velocity \u03b212 = (\u03b21 \u2212 \u03b22 )/(1 \u2212 \u03b21 \u03b22 ),\n2 \u22121/2\nor by the relative Lorentz factor \u03b312 = (1 \u2212 \u03b212\n)\n, which is given by\n\u03b312 = (1 \u2212 \u03b21 \u03b22 )\u03b31 \u03b32 = \u03b31 \u03b32 \u2212 [(\u03b312 \u2212 1)(\u03b322 \u2212 1)]1/2 .\n\n(8)\n\nThe shock strength \u03b312 is then directly calculated using Equation (6),\n\u03b312 =\n\n(a\u03ba2 \u2212 1)\n.\n(1 + \u03ba2 )\n\n(9)\n\nThus, we find a very simple form for the compression ratio a in terms of \u03ba2 and \u03b312 ,\na=\n\n\u03c12\n(1 + \u03ba2 )\u03b312 + 1\n=\n.\n\u03c11\n\u03ba2\n\n(10)\n\nSubstituting the compression ratio (10) into Equations (6) and (7), we now express \u03b31 , \u03b32 ,\nand p2 in terms of \u03ba2 and \u03b312 ,\n(\u03b312 + 1)[(1 + \u03ba2 )\u03b312 \u2212 \u03ba2 ]2\n,\n(1 \u2212 \u03ba22 )\u03b312 + (1 + \u03ba22 )\n(\u03b312 + 1)\n=\n,\n2\n(1 \u2212 \u03ba2 )\u03b312 + (1 + \u03ba22 )\n= (\u03b312 \u2212 1)[(1 + \u03ba2 )\u03b312 + 1] \u03c11 c2 .\n\n\u03b312 =\n\n(11)\n\n\u03b322\n\n(12)\n\np2\n\n(13)\n\nAs we shall see below, \u03ba2 here is in fact a function of \u03b312 , and therefore the shock strength\n\u03b312 becomes the only free parameter of the shock. Combining Equations (5), (10), and (13),\nwe verify an expected relation,\ne2 =\n\n1\np2 + \u03c12 c2 = \u03b312 \u03c12 c2 ,\n\u03ba2\n\n(14)\n\nwhich means that the shock strength \u03b312 is equal to the mean random Lorentz factor of\nparticles in the postshock medium (measured in its fluid frame).\nIt may be noticed that there are only three independent equations among Equations\n(10)-(14), since we had three jump conditions in the beginning. In fact, three of them are\nequivalent to those equations that appear on Blandford & McKee (1976).\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n2.2.\n\nRelation between \u03ba and mean Lorentz factor \u03b3\u0304\n2.2.1. Relativistic ideal gas\n\nWe briefly review a relativistic ideal gas where a particle of mass m and momentum p\u0303 has\n\u0002\n\u00031/2\nthe energy \u01eb(p\u0303) = mc2 1 + (p\u0303/mc)2\n. The Maxwellian momentum distribution function\n2\nf (p\u0303) is given as f (p\u0303) = A p\u0303 exp [\u2212\u01eb(p\u0303)/(kB T )], where A is a proportionality constant, kB\nis the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature of the gas. Using a normalization\nR\u221e\ncondition on the number density, n = 0 f (p\u0303)dp\u0303, the proportionality constant is found to be\nn\nu\n2\nA = (mc)\n3 K (u) , with a modified Bessel function K2 . Here we have defined u \u2261 (mc )/(kB T ),\n2\nwhich basically measures how relativistic the gas is; u \u226b 1 corresponds to a non-relativistic\nlimit and u \u226a 1 to an ultra-relativistic limit. We evaluate the integrals of pressure and\nenergy density of the gas:\nZ\n1 \u221e\np\u0303 v(p\u0303)f (p\u0303)dp\u0303 = nkB T,\n(15)\np =\n3 0\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ \u221e\nK1 (u) 3\n2\ne =\n\u01eb(p\u0303)f (p\u0303)dp\u0303 = (n mc )\n,\n(16)\n+\nK2 (u) u\n0\nwhere v(p\u0303) is the velocity of a particle of momentum p\u0303, and K1 (u) is also a modified Bessel\nfunction. See Greiner et al. (1995) for an alternative derivation. Equation (16) gives the\nmean Lorentz factor \u03b3\u0304 of particles as\n\u03b3\u0304 =\n\nK1 (u) 3\n+ .\nK2 (u) u\n\n(17)\n\nThe quantity \u03ba (defined in Equation (5)) is given as\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\u0015\u22121\np\nK1 (u) 3\n\u03bai =\n= u\n+ \u22121\n.\ne \u2212 \u03c1c2\nK2 (u) u\n\n(18)\n\nHere the subscript i refers to a relativistic ideal Maxwellian gas. Since both \u03b3\u0304 and \u03bai are\ngiven in terms of u only, one should be in principle able to express \u03bai as a function of \u03b3\u0304.\nHowever, it is not easy to do so analytically, as it involves two modified Bessel functions K1\nand K2 . This becomes a good motivation of considering the following monoenergetic gas.\n\n2.2.2. Monoenergetic gas\nHere we consider a monoenergetic gas, where all particles in the gas have the same\nmomentum p\u0304 or the same Lorentz factor \u03b3\u0304 (e.g., Mathews 1971). We show below that\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nthe behavior of this gas is very close to that of a relativistic ideal gas. The momentum\ndistribution function is simply given by a Dirac-delta function, f (p\u0303) = n \u03b4(p\u0303 \u2212 p\u0304), which\nR\u221e\nsatisfies the normalization condition, n = 0 f (p\u0303)dp\u0303. We evaluate the integrals of pressure\nand energy density for this gas:\np = n (mc2 )\n\n\u03b3\u0304 2 \u2212 1\n,\n3\u03b3\u0304\n\ne = n (\u03b3\u0304mc2 ).\n\n(19)\n\nTherefore, the corresponding \u03ba is found to be\np\n1\n\u03bam =\n=\n2\ne \u2212 \u03c1c\n3\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1+\n,\n\u03b3\u0304\n\n(20)\n\nwhere the subscript m refers to a monoenergetic gas. Note that \u03bam has the correct limiting\nvalue 2/3 for a non-relativistic gas and 1/3 for an ultra-relativistic gas. We compare this\nmonoenergetic gas with a relativistic ideal gas, by computing \u03bam /\u03bai numerically as a function\nof \u03b3\u0304. The result is shown in Figure 1. Note that there is only 4.8 % of maximal difference\nat about \u03b3\u0304 = 1.6, and two gases are practically identical especially for high Lorentz factors\nabove 10.\nRelation (20) is simple, and thus very useful in dealing with a relativistic gas. In the\nfollowing section, we show that the jump conditions (10)-(14) simplify significantly when the\ngas is treated as monoenergetic.\n\n2.3.\n\nJump conditions of a monoenergetic gas\n\nWe continue on the problem of a relativistic shock wave for the case of a monoenergetic\ngas. When the gas in the postshock medium (region 2) is treated as monoenergetic, the\nquantity \u03ba2 satisfies\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n\u03ba2 =\n1+\n,\n(21)\n3\n\u03b312\nsince the mean Lorentz factor in Equation (20) is equal to the shock strength \u03b312 as shown\nin Equation (14). Using relation (21), we rewrite the jump conditions (10)-(14) in terms of\n\u03b312 only:\n2\n4\u03b212\n(4\u03b312\n\u2212 1)2\nor\n\u03b21 = 2\n,\n2\n8\u03b312 + 1\n\u03b212 + 3\n2\n9\u03b312\n\u03b212\n\u03b322 =\nor\n\u03b22 =\n,\n2\n8\u03b312 + 1\n3\n4 2\n(\u03b3 \u2212 1) \u03c11 c2 ,\np2 =\n3 12\n2\na = \u03c12 /\u03c11 = 4\u03b312 ,\ne2 = 4\u03b312\n\u03c11 c2 .\n\n\u03b312 =\n\n(22)\n(23)\n(24)\n(25)\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nIt has become clear that the shock strength \u03b312 is the only free parameter of the shock.\nWe emphasize that these simple equations (22)-(25) are exact for a monoenergetic gas and\napply to shocks of arbitrary strength (relativistic, mildly relativistic, or non-relativistic).\nThis result is also briefly described in Beloborodov & Uhm (2006).\n\n3.\n\nBlast waves\n\nA central explosion of a GRB ejects a large amount of material with high Lorentz factors\n\u0393ej \u223c 102 \u2212 103 . This ejected flow is called the \"ejecta\". The ejecta expands and drives a\nforward shock (FS) wave into the external ambient medium. When the ejecta interacts with\nthe ambient medium, another shock wave \u2013 a reverse shock (RS) \u2013 develops and propagates\nthrough the ejecta. Thus, this standard picture has four regions: (1) external ambient\nmedium, (2) shocked external medium, (3) shocked ejecta, and (4) unshocked ejecta (e.g.,\nPiran 2004). In Figure 2, we show schematically these four regions. The shocked external\nmedium is separated from the shocked ejecta by a contact discontinuity (CD). Two shocked\nregions 2 and 3 between the FS and RS are hot and called the \"blast\".\nWe assume that the whole blast moves with a common Lorentz factor \u0393. This is reasonable since internal motions in the blast are subsonic, and hydrodynamical simulations\nconfirm that \u0393 \u2248 const between the FS and RS (Kobayashi & Sari 2000). The Lorentz\nfactors \u0393f , \u0393r , and \u0393ej , denoting for the FS, RS, and ejecta, respectively, are measured in\nthe lab. frame. The ambient medium is at rest in the lab. frame. The rest-mass density \u03c1,\nenergy density e (including rest energy), and pressure p in each region are measured in its\nown rest frame. It is assumed that the ambient medium and ejecta are \"cold,\" having no\npressure.\n\n3.1.\n\nRadially stratified ejecta\n\nThe explosion ejecta is viewed as a sequence of shells that coast with Lorentz factors \u0393ej .\nEach shell is prescribed an ejection time \u03c4 . The ejection time plays the role of Lagrangian\ncoordinate that labels the shells in the ejecta. Theoretically, the ejecta is expected to emerge\nwith a monotonic velocity profile as a result of internal shocks that take place at small radii\nr < 1016 cm (e.g., Piran 2004). At the end of the internal-shock stage, any two adjacent shells\nno longer collide with each other. Thus, we consider here only a non-increasing function\nof \u0393ej (\u03c4 ); \u0393\u2032ej (\u03c4 ) \u2261 d\u0393ej /d\u03c4 \u2264 0. Note that \u0393ej should remain independent of the lab.\ntime t as each shell coasts without colliding with another shell. The corresponding velocity\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nvej (\u03c4 ) = c (1 \u2212 1/\u03932ej)1/2 is also non-increasing. The initial density of the ejecta may, however,\nhave an arbitrary radial profile. The evolution of such \"stratified\" ejecta is analytically\nstudied here, restricted to the unshocked ejecta.\nWe assume spherical symmetry. However, the calculation remains valid even if the\n\u22121\nexplosion is driven by a jet with a small opening angle \u03b8jet as long as \u0393ej \u226b \u03b8jet\n; the jet\nbehaves like a portion of spherical ejecta since the edge of the jet is causally disconnected\nfrom its axis.\n\n3.1.1. Continuity equation of stratified ejecta\nThe 4-velocity u\u03b1 for a spherically symmetric ejecta is written in spherical polar coordinates (ct, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) as u\u03b1 = \u0393ej (c, vej , 0, 0), where t indicates the lab. time, and r is\nthe radius measured from the center of the explosion. The continuity equation for ejecta is\nsimply \u2207\u03b1 (\u03c1ej u\u03b1 ) = 0. Here the ejecta density \u03c1ej is measured in the rest frame of ejecta.\nThen the continuity equation reads\n\nwhich becomes\n\n1 \u2202\n1 \u2202\n(\u03c1ej \u0393ej c) + 2\n(r 2 \u03c1ej \u0393ej vej ) = 0,\nc \u2202t r\nr \u2202r t\n\n(26)\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n2\n(\u03c1ej \u0393ej ) +\n(\u03c1ej \u0393ej vej ) + (\u03c1ej \u0393ej vej ) = 0.\n\u2202t r\n\u2202r t\nr\n\n(27)\n\nWe describe below a simple way of solving Equation (27) that makes use of the Lagrangian\ncoordinate \u03c4 .\nConsider a shell in ejecta that was ejected at time \u03c4 with velocity vej (\u03c4 ). The radius r\nof this \u03c4 -shell at time t is given by\nZ t\nr(\u03c4, t) =\nvej (\u03c4 ) dt\u2032 = vej (\u03c4 ) (t \u2212 \u03c4 ).\n(28)\n\u03c4\n\nEquation (28) is viewed as a relationship among three coordinates r, t, and \u03c4 . Any two of\nthose can be regarded as two independent variables. In Equation (27), the coordinates r and\nt are two independent variables. Since \u0393ej (\u03c4 ) and vej (\u03c4 ) are functions of \u03c4 only, it is useful\nto have \u03c4 as one of the variables instead of, e.g., time t. Using relation (28), we eliminate\ntime t from Equation (27), and adopt the coordinates \u03c4 and r as two independent variables.\nFirst, we partially differentiate the relation r = vej (\u03c4 ) (t \u2212 \u03c4 ) with respect to t at fixed r,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\u03c4\n\u2202r\nr\n\u2202\u03c4\n\u2032\n= 0 = vej (\u03c4 )\n,\n(29)\n+ vej (\u03c4 ) 1 \u2212\n\u2202t r\n\u2202t r vej (\u03c4 )\n\u2202t r\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nwhich yields\n\u2202\u03c4\n\u2202t\n\n=\nr\n\n1\n,\n1 \u2212 r(vej\u2032 /vej2 )\n\n(30)\n\n\u22121\n.\nvej \u2212 r(vej\u2032 /vej )\n\n(32)\n\nwhere vej\u2032 (\u03c4 ) \u2261 dvej /d\u03c4 . Similarly, we differentiate Equation (28) with respect to r at fixed t,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202r\n\u2202\u03c4\nr\n\u2202\u03c4\n\u2032\n= 1 = vej (\u03c4 )\n,\n(31)\n+ vej (\u03c4 ) 0 \u2212\n\u2202r t\n\u2202r t vej (\u03c4 )\n\u2202r t\nwhich yields\n\u2202\u03c4\n\u2202r\n\n=\nt\n\nThen we find\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\u2202\n\u2202r\n\n=\nr\n\n=\nt\n\n\u2202\u03c4\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03c4\n\u2202r\n\nr\n\nt\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c4\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c4\n\n\u2202r\n\u2202t\nr\n\u2202r\n+\n\u2202r\nr\n+\n\n\u2202\nr \u2202r\n\u2202\nt \u2202r\n\n1\n\u2202\n,\n\u2032\n2\n1 \u2212 r(vej /vej ) \u2202\u03c4 r\n\u03c4\n\u22121\n\u2202\n\u2202\n=\n+\n\u2032\nvej \u2212 r(vej /vej ) \u2202\u03c4 r \u2202r\n\u03c4\n=\n\n(33)\n.\n\n(34)\n\n\u03c4\n\nWe substitute Equations (33) and (34) into Equation (27), and divide the whole equation\nby \u03c1ej \u0393ej vej . Then we get\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n2\n\u2202\n\u2202\n1\nln\n[ln \u03c1ej + ln(\u0393ej vej )] + = 0,\n+\n(35)\n\u2032\nvej \u2212 r(vej /vej ) \u2202\u03c4 r\nvej\n\u2202r \u03c4\nr\nwhere the term ln(\u0393ej vej ) vanishes since it is a function of \u03c4 only. Equation (35) becomes\n\u2212vej\u2032 /vej\n\u2202\n+\n\u2032\nvej \u2212 r(vej /vej )\n\u2202r\n\n[ln \u03c1ej ] +\n\u03c4\n\n2\n= 0.\nr\n\nFinally, we integrate Equation (36) over r at fixed \u03c4 ,\n\u0015\n\u0014\nvej\u2032\nln 1 \u2212 r 2 + ln \u03c1ej + 2 ln r = ln [f (\u03c4 )] ,\nvej\n\n(36)\n\n(37)\n\nwhere f (\u03c4 ) is an arbitrary positive function of \u03c4 . Thus, we find an analytical solution of the\ncontinuity equation for stratified ejecta,\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\u22121\nvej\u2032 \u22121 f (\u03c4 )\n\u0393\u2032ej\nf (\u03c4 )\nr\n\u03c1ej (\u03c4, r) = 2 1 \u2212 r 2\n= 2 1\u2212\n.\n(38)\nr\nvej\nr\nc (\u03932ej \u2212 1)3/2\nHere we have used the relation vej\u2032 (\u03c4 ) = (c2 /vej )(\u0393\u2032ej /\u03933ej ). The function f (\u03c4 ) is determined\nbelow by the initial profile of ejecta near the center of the burst. The factor 1/r 2 represents\nan overall side expansion in 3 dimensional space. The remaining factor inside the brackets\nis responsible for a local spread-out of the ejecta due to its stratification. For 1 dimensional\nplane-parallel symmetry, the solution \u03c1ej remains the same as above, except that there is no\n1/r 2 factor.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n3.1.2. Initial profile of the ejecta\nThe \u03c4 -shell of energy \u03b4Eej (\u03c4 ), ejected at an ejection time \u03c4 , coasts with its Lorentz factor\n\u0393ej (\u03c4 ). The initial profile of the ejected flow is set by the central engine of the explosion.\nNote that it is completely described by two functions; \u0393ej (\u03c4 ) and Lej (\u03c4 ) \u2261 dEej /d\u03c4 . Here\nthe luminosity Lej (\u03c4 ) is related to the mass flow rate \u1e40 (\u03c4 ) as Lej = \u0393ej \u1e40 c2 . For small radii\nr, the mass flow rate is given by \u1e40 = (4\u03c0r 2 vej ) (\u03c1ej \u0393ej ). Then the initial profile of ejecta\ndensity \u03c1ej at the burst place is expressed as\n\u03c1ej (\u03c4, r) =\n\nLej\n.\n2\n4\u03c0r vej \u03932ej c2\n\n(39)\n\nThe solution (38) has a limiting form \u03c1ej = f (\u03c4 )/r 2 for small radii r. Thus we determine the\nfunction f (\u03c4 ),\nLej\n\u1e40\nf (\u03c4 ) =\n=\n.\n(40)\n4\u03c0vej \u03932ej c2\n4\u03c0vej \u0393ej\nHence the ejecta density is derived as\n\u0014\n\u0015\u22121\n\u0393\u2032ej\nr\nLej (\u03c4 )\n1\u2212\n.\n\u03c1ej (\u03c4, r) =\n4\u03c0r 2 vej \u03932ej c2\nc (\u03932ej \u2212 1)3/2\n\n(41)\n\nThe solution (41) is exact; we remark, however, that \u0393\u2032ej (\u03c4 ) \u2264 0 is assumed in the derivation.\nFor given \u0393ej (\u03c4 ) and Lej (\u03c4 ), the solution (41) allows us to fully understand the subsequent\nevolution of the ejected flow. The solution (41) is presented in Uhm & Beloborodov (2007)\nwith no derivation.\n\n3.2.\n\nJump conditions of the FS and RS\n\nIn Section 2, we derived a simple form of jump conditions for shocks of arbitrary strength.\nWe apply those jump conditions to the FS and RS of the blast wave, treating the gas in the\nblast as monoenergetic.\nThe Lorentz factors \u03b31 and \u03b32 are measured in the rest frame of the FS. As the ambient\nmedium is at rest in the lab. frame, we note that\n\u03b3 1 = \u0393f ,\n\n\u03b32 = (1 \u2212 \u03b2\u03b2f )\u0393\u0393f ,\n\nand\n\n\u03b312 = \u0393.\n\n(42)\n\nThe relative Lorentz factor \u03b312 = \u0393 describes the shock strength of the FS. Then the jump\nconditions of the FS read\n\u03b312 =\n\n(4\u03932 \u2212 1)2\n8\u03932 + 1\n\nor\n\n\u03b21 =\n\n4\u03b2\n,\n\u03b22 + 3\n\n(43)\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n9\u03932\n\u03b2\nor\n\u03b22 = ,\n2\n8\u0393 + 1\n3 \u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n4 2\n2\n1+\n,\n(\u0393 \u2212 1) \u03c11 c ,\n\u03ba2 =\n=\n3\n3\n\u0393\n= 4\u0393 \u03c11 ,\ne2 = 4\u03932 \u03c11 c2 .\n\n\u03b322 =\n\n(44)\n\np2\n\n(45)\n\n\u03c12\n\n(46)\n\nThus, the Lorentz factor \u0393f and the thermodynamic quantities \u03c12 , e2 , p2 , and \u03ba2 immediately\nbehind the FS are found in terms of \u0393 and \u03c11 . Here \u03c11 should be evaluated for the ambient\nmedium immediately ahead the FS, which we denote by \u03c11 (FS).\nThe RS is described by the same set of jump conditions when index 1 is replaced by 4\nand index 2 by 3. The Lorentz factors \u03b33 and \u03b34 are measured in the rest frame of the RS,\n\u03b33 = (1 \u2212 \u03b2\u03b2r ) \u0393\u0393r ,\n\nand\n\n\u03b34 = (1 \u2212 \u03b2ej \u03b2r ) \u0393ej \u0393r .\n\n(47)\n\nThe shock strength of the RS is described by the relative Lorentz factor \u03b343 ,\n\u03b343 = (1 \u2212 \u03b24 \u03b23 ) \u03b34 \u03b33 = (1 \u2212 \u03b2\u03b2ej ) \u0393\u0393ej .\n\n(48)\n\nThen the jump conditions of the RS read\n2\n4\u03b243\n(4\u03b343\n\u2212 1)2\nor\n\u03b24 = 2\n,\n2\n8\u03b343 + 1\n\u03b243 + 3\n2\n9\u03b343\n\u03b243\n=\nor\n\u03b23 =\n,\n2\n8\u03b343 + 1\n3\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n4 2\n1\n2\n1+\n,\n=\n(\u03b3 \u2212 1) \u03c14 c ,\n\u03ba3 =\n3 43\n3\n\u03b343\n2\n= 4\u03b343 \u03c14 ,\ne3 = 4\u03b343\n\u03c14 c2 .\n\n\u03b342 =\n\n(49)\n\n\u03b332\n\n(50)\n\np3\n\u03c13\n\n(51)\n(52)\n\nEquation (47) yields the Lorentz factor \u0393r ,\n\u0393r = (1 \u2212 \u03b2\u03b23 ) \u0393\u03b33 = (1 \u2212 \u03b2ej \u03b24 ) \u0393ej \u03b34 ,\n\n(53)\n\nwhere \u03b33 and \u03b34 are now given in terms of \u03b343 = (1 \u2212 \u03b2\u03b2ej ) \u0393\u0393ej above. Thus, the Lorentz\nfactor \u0393r and the thermodynamic quantities \u03c13 , e3 , p3 , and \u03ba3 immediately behind the RS\nare found in terms of \u0393, \u0393ej , and \u03c14 . Here \u0393ej and \u03c14 should be evaluated for the shell\nimmediately ahead the RS, which we denote by \u0393ej (RS) and \u03c14 (RS) \u2261 \u03c1ej (RS), respectively.\nLet the RS be located at radius rr and sweep up the \u03c4r -shell in the ejecta when the\nFS is located at radius rf ; the subscripts r and f refer to the RS and FS, respectively.\nWhen three functions \u03c11 (r), \u0393ej (\u03c4 ), and Lej (\u03c4 ) are known, we find then \u03c11 (FS) = \u03c11 (rf ),\n\u0393ej (RS) = \u0393ej (\u03c4r ), and \u03c1ej (RS) = \u03c1ej (\u03c4r , rr ); the ejecta density \u03c1ej (RS) is given by the solution\n(41).\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nThus the Lorentz factor \u0393 becomes the only free parameter for the blast wave with\nknown input functions \u03c11 , \u0393ej , and Lej . This is justified since we are given 6 independent\nequations (3 plus 3 jump conditions) for 7 unknowns, which are \u0393, \u0393f , \u0393r , two independent\nthermodynamic quantities describing the gas behind the FS, and another two for the gas\nbehind the RS.\n\n3.3.\n\nTrajectory of the RS through ejecta\n\nThe path of the RS needs to be consistently tracked, as it propagates through the ejecta.\nConsider the RS located at radius rr (t) at time t, sweeping up the \u03c4r (t)-shell. Equation (28)\ngives the radius of the \u03c4r -shell at time t, which equals rr (t); rr (t) = vej (\u03c4r [t]) (t \u2212 \u03c4r [t]). Then\nwe find the velocity vr of the RS,\n\u0013\n\u0012\ndrr\nd\u03c4r\nd\u03c4r rr\n\u2032\nvr \u2261\n(54)\n= vej (\u03c4r )\n+ vej (\u03c4r ) 1 \u2212\ndt\ndt vej (\u03c4r )\ndt\n\u0015\n\u0014\nvej\u2032 (\u03c4r ) d\u03c4r\n= vej (\u03c4r ) \u2212 vej (\u03c4r ) 1 \u2212 rr 2\n.\n(55)\nvej (\u03c4r ) dt\nUsing the relation\n\ndrr d\u03c4r\nd\u03c4r\nd\u03c4r\n=\n= vr\n,\ndt\ndt drr\ndrr\nwe find a differential equation for d\u03c4r /drr ,\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0014\n\u0015\nvej\u2032 (\u03c4r ) \u22121\nd\u03c4r\n1\n1\n=\n\u2212\n1 \u2212 rr 2\n.\ndrr\nvr vej (\u03c4r )\nvej (\u03c4r )\n\n(56)\n\n(57)\n\nEquation (53) gives the velocity vr in terms of \u0393 and \u0393ej (\u03c4r ). Thus, Equation (57) allows\nus to follow the trajectory of the RS through ejecta when \u0393 is known; for an infinitesimal\ndisplacement \u03b4rr of the RS, we numerically solve Equation (57) to find \u03b4\u03c4r .\nThe Lorentz factor \u0393 is determined below by two different methods: (1) customary pressure balance (see Section 3.5) and (2) the mechanical model (see Section 4). We demonstrate\nthat the method (1) does not satisfy the energy-conservation law for adiabatic blast waves.\n\n3.4.\n\nAdiabatic blast\n\nAs the blast wave propagates through the ambient medium, the blast grows and the gas\nin the blast evolves hydrodynamically. A simple way of dealing with an adiabatic evolution\nof the blast is described here. Since we treat the gas as monoenergetic, we first study the\nadiabatic process of a monoenergetic gas.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n3.4.1. Adiabatic process of a monoenergetic gas\nConsider a relativistic monoenergetic gas, which has the pressure p, energy density e,\nmean Lorentz factor \u03b3\u0304, volume V , number density n, and particle number N. An adiabatic\nprocess of the gas is defined by d(eV ) = \u2212p dV . When the particle number is conserved,\nwe have N = nV = const, or dV = \u2212N dn/n2 . Recalling Equation (19) for p and e of the\nmonoenergetic gas, we find\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2\n2\n2 \u03b3\u0304 \u2212 1 N\nd(nV \u03b3\u0304mc ) = n mc\ndn ,\n(58)\n3\u03b3\u0304\nn2\nwhich yields\n\n1\n3\u03b3\u0304\nd\u03b3\u0304 = dn.\n\u2212 1)\nn\nHere m denotes the particle mass in the gas. We integrate Equation (59) to find\n(\u03b3\u0304 2\n\nn \u221d (\u03b3\u0304 2 \u2212 1)3/2\n\nand\n\np\u221d\n\n1 2\n(\u03b3\u0304 \u2212 1)5/2 .\n\u03b3\u0304\n\n(59)\n\n(60)\n\nNote that p \u221d \u03b3\u0304 4 is verified for the adiabatic process of an ultra-relativistic gas \u03b3\u0304 \u226b 1. Using\nEquation (20), i.e., \u03ba = 31 (1 + 1/\u03b3\u0304), or \u03b3\u0304 = 1/(3\u03ba \u2212 1), we re-write relation (60) as\np\u221d\n\n\u03ba5/2 ( 32 \u2212 \u03ba)5/2\n\u2261 pm (\u03ba).\n(\u03ba \u2212 13 )4\n\n(61)\n\nHere we have defined the function pm (\u03ba) for the right-hand side. The function pm (\u03ba) is\nmonotonically decreasing in its valid range, 31 < \u03ba < 32 . The proportionality constant in\nEquation (61) is related to the entropy of the gas, which is conserved for the adiabatic\nprocess.\n\n3.4.2. Evolution of adiabatic blast\nWe discretize the external ambient medium and ejecta into spherical mass shells \u03b4m,\nand use a Lagrangian description for the blast wave. Each \u03b4m is impulsively heated at some\npoint by a shock front (FS or RS), acquiring its initial pressure p and quantity \u03ba, which\nare given by the jump conditions (see Section 3.2). Using Equation (61), we can track the\nsubsequent adiabatic evolution of each \u03b4m if we know the evolution of its pressure; the initial\np and \u03ba determine the proportionality constant, and we find numerically the new quantity \u03ba\nwhen \u03b4m is at new pressure p. All other thermodynamic quantities of \u03b4m can then be found\naccordingly. For instance, the volume \u03b4V of the mass shell is obtained as\n\u03b4V =\n\nmc2 \u03ba( 32 \u2212 \u03ba)\nmc2 (\u03b3\u0304 2 \u2212 1)\n\u03b4N,\n\u03b4N =\np\n3\u03b3\u0304\np (\u03ba \u2212 13 )\n\n(62)\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nusing Equation (19) and \u03b3\u0304 = 1/(3\u03ba \u2212 1). This volume \u03b4V is defined in the rest frame of the\nmass shell. The particle number \u03b4N of the mass shell is calculated when \u03b4m is shocked by\na shock front, by making use of the particle number flux in Equation (2).\n\n3.4.3. Energy of the blast\nWe may then calculate the energy of the blast. When the blast has an instantaneous\nLorentz factor \u0393, the total energy of the entire blast is evaluated in the lab. frame by\nintegrating the 00-component of energy-momentum tensor over the volume of each \u03b4m:\n\u0012 \u0013 X\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\nX\u0002\n\u0003 \u03b4V\n1\n2\nEblast =\n\u0393 (e + p) \u2212 p\n=\n\u0393 e \u03b4V + \u0393 \u2212\np \u03b4V .\n(63)\n\u0393\n\u0393\n{\u03b4m}\n\n{\u03b4m}\n\nDue to the Lorentz contraction, \u03b4V /\u0393 is the volume of \u03b4m in the lab. frame. Replacing the\nenergy e \u03b4V by (\u03b3\u0304 mc2 ) \u03b4N and using Equation (62) for p \u03b4V , we find\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\nX\u0014\n\u0001\n1\n1\n1\n\u0393\u2212\n\u03b3\u0304 \u2212\nmc2 \u03b4N .\n(64)\nEblast =\n\u0393 \u03b3\u0304 +\n3\n\u0393\n\u03b3\u0304\n{\u03b4m}\n\nWe emphasize that the second term here needs to be included in order to correctly express\nthe energy of blast. For relativistic blast waves, \u03932 \u226b 1, Equation (64) becomes\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\nX \u00141 \u0012\n\u0001 X\n\u0001\n1\n(1 \u2212 \u03ba)(3\u03ba + 1)\n2\nEblast \u2243\n\u0393\n4\u03b3\u0304 \u2212\nmc \u03b4N =\n\u0393\nmc2 \u03b4N .\n(65)\n3\n\u03b3\u0304\n(3\u03ba \u2212 1)\n{\u03b4m}\n\n{\u03b4m}\n\nR\u221e\nThe energy E4 of unshocked ejecta (region 4) is easily found as E4 = \u03c4r Lej (\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 ,\nwhere \u03c4r indicates the location of the RS in the ejecta. The energy of region 1 is negligible\nsince the ambient medium is at rest in the lab. frame. Thus, the total energy of the entire\nsystem is obtained as Etot = Eblast + E4 .\n\n3.5.\n\nCustomary pressure balance: pf = pr\n\nA customary approximation assumes a pressure balance across the blast wave; i.e., the\npressure pf at the FS is equated to the pressure pr at the RS. Equations (45) and (51) give\nthe pressures pf = p2 and pr = p3 ,\npf =\n\n4 2\n(\u0393 \u2212 1) \u03c11 c2 ,\n3\n\npr =\n\n4 2\n(\u03b343 \u2212 1) \u03c14 c2 .\n3\n\n(66)\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nFor relativistic blast waves (\u0393ej \u226b 1 and \u0393 \u226b 1), the pressure balance pf = pr determines\nthe instantaneous \u0393 of the blast wave (Beloborodov & Uhm 2006),\n\"\n\u0012 \u00131/2 #\u22121/2\n\u03c11\n,\npf = pr ,\n(67)\n\u0393 = \u0393ej 1 + 2 \u0393ej\n\u03c1ej\ndenoting \u03c14 = \u03c1ej . Recall that \u03c11 = \u03c11 (FS), \u03c1ej = \u03c1ej (RS), and \u0393ej = \u0393ej (RS) should be used\nhere; see Section 3.2.\nThe solution (67) indicates that the dynamical evolution of the blast wave is determined\nby purely input parameters \u03c11 , \u03c1ej , and \u0393ej of regions 1 and 4. The solution \u0393 has no\ninformation on the thermodynamical status of the gas in blast. This observation makes us\nto doubt the validity of the solution (67). The assumption pf = pr itself is then doubted.\nAs we demonstrate below, the solution (67) in fact does not satisfy the energy conservation\nfor adiabatic blast waves.\n\n3.5.1. Example model\nThe initial setup of an explosion is specified by three functions \u03c11 , \u0393ej , and Lej , which\ncan be arbitrary as long as \u0393\u2032ej (\u03c4 ) \u2264 0. We consider a simple example model that assumes\nLej (\u03c4 ) = L0 = 1052 erg/s,\n\n\u0393ej (\u03c4 ) = 500 \u2212 9\u03c4,\n\n0 \u2264 \u03c4 \u2264 \u03c4b = 50 s.\n\n(68)\n\nThe luminosity Lej remains at a constant L0 during the duration \u03c4b of the burst. The Lorentz\nfactor \u0393ej decreases linearly from 500 to 50. The total energy Eb of the burst is simply Eb =\nL0 \u03c4b . The ambient medium is assumed to have a uniform density n1 = \u03c11 /mp = 1 cm\u22123 .\nHere mp is the proton mass.\nFor this example burst, we find the evolution of the blast wave as follows. Suppose\nthat, at time t, the RS is located at radius rr (t), the FS is located at radius rf (t), the\n\u03c4r (t)-shell passes through the RS, and the blast has the Lorentz factor \u0393(t). We evaluate\n\u03c11 (FS) = \u03c11 (rf ), \u0393ej (RS) = \u0393ej (\u03c4r ), and \u03c1ej (RS) = \u03c1ej (\u03c4r , rr ) (Equation (41)), which in\nturn gives \u03b343 , \u03b33 , \u0393r (Equation (53)), and \u0393f . For an infinitesimal displacement \u03b4rr of the\nRS, we numerically solve Equation (57) to find \u03b4\u03c4r . Equation (28), r = vej (\u03c4 ) (t \u2212 \u03c4 ), i.e.,\nt = r/vej (\u03c4 ) + \u03c4 , gives then the time for the new location of the RS (rr + \u03b4rr in radius and\n\u03c4r + \u03b4\u03c4r in ejecta). Thus, we find the time interval \u03b4t for this displacement \u03b4rr . The new\nlocation of the FS is found by its displacement \u03b4rf during \u03b4t with the velocity given by its\nLorentz factor \u0393f . We evaluate \u03c11 (FS), \u0393ej (RS), and \u03c1ej (RS) again for the new location.\nThen the solution (67) determines the Lorentz factor \u0393 of the blast for the new location.\nThe result is shown in Figure 3.\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nThe solution (67) also determines the pressure p = pf = pr across the blast. This\nenables us to track the adiabatic evolution of the mass shells in blast (see Section 3.4.2), and\nto find the total energy Etot of the entire system (see Section 3.4.3). In Figure 4, we show\nthe resulting total energy Etot . Apparently, the energy conservation is not satisfied; Etot has\ndecreased by a factor of 5 by the moment the RS crosses the last shell (\u03c4 = 50 s) in the\nejecta.\n\n3.5.2. What is wrong?\nThe spherical expansion of ejecta was completely described by the solution (41). The\npropagation of the RS through ejecta was found self-consistently by Equation (57). The\nconservation laws of energy-momentum tensor and mass flux were explicitly applied across\nboth the FS and the RS (the jump conditions). The gas in blast, however, was not required\nto obey those conservation laws; i.e., the pressure balance pf = pr omits the physics laws\nthat should govern the gas in blast. Evidently, this is why the energy conservation for\nthe adiabatic blast wave was not satisfied above. Note that one among three independent\nconservation laws was effectively applied to the blast, since we tracked the adiabatic evolution\nof the mass shells in blast in order to find the total energy of the system.\nAdiabatic expansion of the gas in blast implies a pdV work done to the gas itself. This\nwork needs to be converted to the kinetic energy of the bulk motion of blast. Clearly, such a\nconversion mechanism is absent from the solution (67) as it depends only on input parameters\nof regions 1 and 4. A correct modeling for the blast wave should indicate a mechanism that\nthe dynamical variable \u0393 is affected by the thermodynamic status of the gas in blast.\nApplying the conservation laws of energy-momentum tensor and mass flux to everywhere\non the blast, we developed a simple \"mechanical model\" for the blast wave (Beloborodov\n& Uhm 2006). The mechanical model successfully resolves the energy-violation problem,\nbecause it replaces the pressure balance pf = pr by the physics laws. We summarize the\nmodel below including more detailed equations.\n\n4.\n\nMechanical model for relativistic blast waves\n\nThe gas in the blast wave flows radially with the 4-velocity u\u03b1 = \u03b3 (1, \u03b2, 0, 0) in spherical coordinates (ct, r, \u03b8, \u03c6), where the metric ds2 = \u2212c2 dt2 + dr 2 + r 2 d\u03b82 + r 2 sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 has\nthe determinant g = \u2212r 4 sin2 \u03b8.

One more equation\nis required to close the set of coupled differential equations. We propose the following\napproximate relation:\nH \u2212 \u03a3c2 = 4P.\n(92)\n\nAs shown in Beloborodov & Uhm (2006), it is accurate in the limits of both an ultrarelativistic RS and a non-relativistic RS, and should be a reasonable approximation in an\nintermediate case.\n\n5.\n\nDiscussion\n\nA dynamical evolution of the blast wave is found for the mechanical model as follows.\nFor an infinitesimal displacement of the blast, we numerically solve the coupled equations\n(82)-(84) and (92) of the mechanical model, and find the instantaneous Lorentz factor \u0393 and\nintegrated quantities H, \u03a3, and P . We also solve the differential equation (57) to get the\nRS trajectory through the ejecta.\nFor the same example model as used for the customary pressure balance pr = pf , we\nfind the blast-wave evolution. Recall that the example burst is described in Equation (68)\nand the ambient medium is assumed to have the density n1 = \u03c11 /mp = 1 cm\u22123 . The result\nfound for the mechanical model is shown in Figure 5 (in solid lines); for comparison, the\nsolution found for the pressure balance is shown together (in dotted lines). Note that two\nsets of solutions differ significantly; in particular, the blast wave obtained for the mechanical\nmodel decelerates slower and propagates farther (see Panel c) until the RS arrives at the\nsame last shell (\u03c4 = 50 s) in the ejecta (see Panel a). For the pressure balance, on the other\nhand, the energy loss shown in Figure 4 is responsible for the earlier deceleration of the blast\nwave.\nThe energy of the blast is easily found for the mechanical model; it is evaluated in the\nlab. frame by integrating the 00-component of energy-momentum tensor over volume,\nZ rf\n\u0002 2\n\u0003\n\u0001\n\u0393 (e + p) \u2212 p 4\u03c0r 2 dr \u2243 4\u03c0r 2 (\u03932 H \u2212 P ).\n(93)\nEblast =\nrr\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nWe find this blast energy for the same example model above and show the result in Figure 6.\nThe total energy Etot of the entire system is precisely conserved; the mechanical model is\nindeed a successful remedy for the energy-violation problem.\nThe energy of the blast can alternatively be found by using expression (64). In order to\ntrack the adiabatic evolution of the mass shells in blast (see Section 3.4.2) and to find the\nblast energy, we need to know a pressure profile for the mass shells. In case of the mechanical\nmodel, an instantaneous pressure profile for the blast may be approximated by a quadratic\nfunction of r (rr < r < rf ), which (1) matches two boundary values (pr at rr and pf at rf )\nand (2) satisfies the integrated pressure P . The boundary values are met by a quadratic\nfunction p(r) = a(r \u2212 b)2 + c with\nb =\n\n1\n1 pf \u2212 pr\n(rf + rr ) \u2212\n,\n2\n2a rf \u2212 rr\n\n(94)\n\n\u0012\n\u00132\npf \u2212 pr\n1\na\n1\n2\n.\n(95)\nc =\n(pf + pr ) \u2212 (rf \u2212 rr ) \u2212\n2\n4\n4a rf \u2212 rr\nRr\nThe remaining unknown a is determined such that P = rrf p(r) dr. An upper bound for a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nis required since p(r) is positive everywhere on the blast; a < ( pf + pr )2 /(rf \u2212 rr )2 .\nWe find this quadratic profile for the dynamical evolution shown in Figure 5 (i.e., the\nsolid lines found for the mechanical model) and evaluate expression (64) to find the blast\nenergy. The result is shown in Figure 7. The total energy Etot is conserved within about\n5 % for this example. Thus, the quadratic pressure profile should be a reasonably good\napproximation for the mechanical model.\nWe also calculate the synchrotron emission from both the FS-shocked and RS-shocked\nregions. We make use of the standard prescription of microphysical parameters (e.g., Piran\n2004): \u01ebe (fraction of the shock energy that goes to electron acceleration), \u01ebB (magnetic\nparameter), and p (slope of the electron spectrum). We track the synchrotron emissivity\nof all shells on the blast; i.e., a radiative and adiabatic cooling of the electron spectrum\nis tracked for each shell, and an adiabatic evolution of shocked gas is tracked to give an\nevolution of the magnetic field for each shell. The velocity and spherical curvature of the\nshells are also taken into account. A more detailed description will be presented elsewhere.\nThe resulting afterglow light curves are shown in Figure 8 (R band) and Figure 9 (1 keV).\nWe find that the two different blast-wave evolutions shown in Figure 5 yield significantly\ndifferent sets of light curves for the same example burst. In particular, the light curves\nobtained with the pressure balance decrease earlier than those with the mechanical model,\ndue to an energy loss seen in Figure 4.\nA spherically symmetric formulation presented here becomes less accurate when the\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nsideways expansion becomes important at late stages of the blast-wave evolution; i.e., \u0393 .\n\u22121\n\u03b8jet\n. In their relativistic hydrodynamical simulations, Meliani et al. (2007) showed that a 2D\njet-like model decelerates earlier than its 1D isotropic counterpart when thermally induced\nexpansions lead to significantly high lateral speeds. On the other hand, Zhang & MacFadyen\n(2009) showed that the sideways expansion is a very slow process and previous analytic works\n(Rhoads 1999; Sari et al. 1999) greatly overestimated the rate of the sideways expansion.\n\n6.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs the blast wave propagates, the strength of the RS wave exhibits a transition from\nnon-relativistic to mildly relativistic or relativistic regime (or vice versa). Thus, an EOS\nwith a constant adiabatic index is not adequate for the RS-shocked region. We address that\na more realistic EOS with a variable adiabatic index needs to be used for the gas in the\nRS-shocked region.\nFollowing Mathews (1971), we consider a relativistic monoenergetic gas and find its\nEOS. We show that there is only 4.8 % of maximal difference in the quantity \u03ba (pressure\ndivided by internal energy density) when compared to a relativistic ideal gas. Then we\nshow that jump conditions of relativistic hydrodynamical shocks simplify significantly for\nthe monoenergetic gas (see Section 2). The simple form of jump conditions presented here is\nexact for a monoenergetic gas and applies to shocks of arbitrary strength (relativistic, mildly\nrelativistic, or non-relativistic). We emphasize that its usage is not to be restricted to GRB\nblast waves; it can be applied to other areas of relativistic hydrodynamical shocks.\nThen we present a semi-analytic formulation for relativistic blast waves with a long-lived\nRS. We describe in detail a complete set of tools for finding a dynamical evolution of the\nblast wave for a very general class of explosions. The ambient medium can have an arbitrary\nradial profile, and the explosion ejecta can also be arbitrary as long as \u0393\u2032ej (\u03c4 ) \u2264 0. We\nprovide two different methods of finding dynamics of the blast wave: (1) customary pressure\nbalance and (2) the mechanical model (Beloborodov & Uhm 2006). Using a simple example\nmodel, we show that the pressure balance across the blast wave does not satisfy the energy\nconservation for an adiabatic blast wave; the total energy is decreased by a factor of 5 in the\ncase of the example model.\nThe mechanical model does not assume a pressure balance or proportionality across the\nblast wave (neither pf = pr nor pf /pr = const. is assumed). Instead, it finds the dynamics\nof the blast wave from a set of coupled differential equations that express the conservations\nof energy-momentum tensor and mass flux applied on the blast between the FS and RS.\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nUsing the same example model, we show that the energy conservation is satisfied for the\nmechanical model as expected.\nWe also show that the two methods yield very different dynamical evolutions of the blast\nwave and, as a result, very different afterglow light curves. We conclude that the customary\nprescription of pressure balance poorly describes the dynamics of the blast wave with a\nlong-lived RS and resulting afterglow light curves are inaccurate in a significant manner.\nThe author is grateful to Andrei M.

The energies Eblast , E4 , and Etot are shown in the units of\nEb for the \u03c4r -shell, i.e., the location of the RS in the ejecta. We precisely track the adiabatic\nevolution of the mass shells in the blast (see Section 3.4.2) and find the total energy Etot\nof the entire system (see Section 3.4.3). However, the resulting total energy is clearly not\nconserved above; it has decreased by a factor of 5 by the moment the RS crosses the last\nshell (\u03c4 = 50 s) in the ejecta. This demonstrates that the solution (67) derived from the\npressure balance pf = pr violates the energy-conservation law significantly for the adiabatic\nblast wave.\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\n\n(a)\n\n(d)\n\n(b)\n\n(e)\n\n(c)\n\nFig. 5.- Numerical solutions for the blast-wave driven by the same example burst described\nin Equation (68).
