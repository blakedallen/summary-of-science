Thus, analysis of neutron diffraction data constrain the exchange interaction in all\ntheoretical models to be temperature dependent and represented as Jij(T). Additional\nexperimental and theoretical evidences in support of this conclusion are presented.\n\n1\n\n\fThe Heisenberg model is considered to be the prototype model for magnetic phase transitions\nand is represented as [1-3]\n0\n\n0\n\n.\n\n(1)\n\nHowever, the exchange interaction parameter, Jij(0), in Eq.1 is for a static lattice (T = 0 K). As is\nwell known, the exchange interaction parameter is a function of the wavefunctions of at least two\nelectrons, i and j, whose spins are interacting. It can be a function of more that the wavefunctions\nof the said two electrons in case of indirect or superexchange mechanisms. Therefore, in all\ncases, the exchange interaction can be symbolically represented for a static lattice (T = 0 K) as\n0\n\nwhere\n\n0 ,\n\n0 ,\n\n0 ,\n\n0 ...\n\n0\n\n(2)\n\n0 are present only if the exchange interaction between electrons i and j is\n\nmediated by other ions. The implicit assumption in Eq.1 is that the role of thermal vibrations in\nphase transitions is negligible i.e. whether the role of thermal vibrations is incorporated or\nignored makes little difference to theoretical or experimental results.\n\nAs is well known, magnetic neutron diffraction is the primary technique to determine the\nmagnetic structure and the state of order, especially for antiferromagnetic substances. From the\nvery beginning till date, analysis of neutron diffraction data always incorporates the role of\n\n2\n\n\fthermal vibrations [4-6] even though it is also possible to analyse the same data by ignoring\nthermal vibrations. This contradiction between theoretical models and analysis of neutron\ndiffraction data has gone unnoticed till date.\n\nRecently, we have addressed [7] a similar contradiction in order-disorder alloy phase transitions\nand shown that diffraction data impose severe constraints on all theoretical models. It is essential\nto incorporate thermal vibrations for a correct understanding of order-disorder transitions. In\nparticular, all existing models must be modified to explicitly include a temperature dependent\ninteraction parameter before their predictions can be compared with diffraction data [7].\n\nWhile the main ideas in alloy and magnetic phase transitions are similar, some differences exist.\nFirstly, in alloy phase transitions, the ordered and disordered phases can have different elastic\nproperties leading to a vibrational entropy contribution. This will be absent in magnetic phase\ntransitions since the chemical environment remains the same. Secondly, in alloy phase transitions\ncritical temperatures are ~ 1000 K which implies that the constraint imposed by diffraction data\nis severe. However, in magnetic phase transitions, the transition temperatures vary from 1 K \u2013\n1000 K. Hence, the role of thermal vibrations must be examined more closely.\n\nIn this paper, we address and resolve the contradiction between theoretical models of magnetic\nphase transitions that ignore thermal vibrations and analysis of magnetic neutron diffraction data\nthat always incorporates the role of thermal vibrations.\n\n3\n\n\fTo explain the temperature dependence of band structures, especially in semiconductors, finite\ntemperature band structure theory was developed [8-10]. This formalism incorporates the role of\nthermal vibrations in electronic structure theory and the correct approach has been described [8]\nas \"A higher order adiabatic perturbation summation can be accomplished by solving\n... exactly (Keffer et. al. 1968) and then using the resulting temperature-dependent\neigenfunctions and energies to calculate the self-energy terms.\" That is, the first step is to solve\nthe electronic structure for a temperature dependent core potential given by\n,\n\nwhere\n\n,0\n\n,\n\n, 0 is the static lattice (0 K) core potential of ion \"i\" and\n\n(3)\n\n,\n\nis the Debye-\n\nWaller factor (DWF). Even before the formal development of the finite temperature band\nstructure theory [8-10], this form of the core potential was empirically used by Keffer [11] and\nothers [12,13] to explain the temperature dependence of band structures. This formalism has\nbeen used to explain several high temperature valence electron properties in metals and\nsemiconductors [11-15].\n\nIt is clear that the high temperature electronic structure theory results in \"temperature-dependent\neigenfunctions and energies\" i.e. \u03c8(T) and \u03b5nk(T) respectively. It follows that, at finite\ntemperatures, the exchange interaction is a function of temperature dependent wavefunctions and\nmust be represented as\n\n4\n\n\f,\n\n...\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nThus, at finite temperatures, the prototype Heisenberg model is modified from Eq.1 as\n.\n\n(5)\n\nThe high temperature electronic structure theory described above [8-10] is based on the adiabatic\napproximation and is valid for insulators and semiconductors at all temperatures and for metals\nabove the Deybe temperature (\u0398D). Thus for insulators and semiconductors at all temperatures\nand for metals above \u0398D, Eq.5 is the correct representation of the prototype Heisenberg model.\nEq.1 is an approximation to Eq.5 that ignores the role of thermal vibrations.\n\nIn unpolarized neutron diffraction, the magnetic intensity is proportional to the magnitude square\nof the magnetic structure factor,\n\nwhich is given by (Eq.6.14 of Ref.5)\n\n.\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere W(G,T) is the Debye-Waller factor and p is the magnetic scattering amplitude that is\nrelated to the magnetic form factor, f, by the relation [Eq.6.10 of Ref.5]\n\n(7)\n\n5\n\n\fAs is well known [16], the magnetic order parameter, magnetization or sublattice magnetization,\nat any temperature is proportional to the magnetic intensity. It is obtained from the relation\n,\n\n0\nwhere\n\n(8)\n\n0 is the magnetic intensity of line G when the\n\nis the magnetic order parameter,\n\nsystem is fully ordered (\u03b7(0) = 1) under static lattice (0 K) conditions.\n\nComparing Eq.3 and Eq.6, both the high temperature electronic structure theory and neutron\ndiffraction theory incorporate the role of thermal vibrations through the Debye-Waller factor.\nClearly, if theoretical models ignore the role of thermal vibrations then the same assumption\nmust be applied to the analysis of experimental neutron diffraction data as well. That is, the DWF\nmust be simultaneously incorporated or ignored (W=0), both in Eq.3 and Eq.6, Eq.8.\n\nIn most studies, the magnetic intensity given by Eq.8 is plotted as a function of temperature,\nthough infrequently, the magnetic order parameter (sublattice magnetization) given by Eq.9a\n(below) has been determined as a function of temperature [17]. The magnetic order parameter is\nobtained from Eq.8 as\n/\n\n0\n\n,\n\n/\n\n(9a)\n\nThe magnetic order parameter obtained from Eq.9a must be compared with predictions from\nmodels based on Eq.5 since both incorporate thermal vibrations. However, if the role of thermal\nvibrations is ignored by setting W=0, the magnetic order parameter is given by\n6\n\n\f/\n\n0\n\n/\n\n(9b)\n\nThe magnetic order parameter obtained from Eq.9b must be compared with predictions from\nmodels based on Eq.1 since both ignore thermal vibrations. However, in Eq.9b, different lines G\ngive different values of the magnetic order parameter.\n\nFrom the above discussion it is clear that the current representation of the magnetic order\nparameter as\n\nis inadequate. We propose a new representation that reflects its dependence\n\non several variables. The experimental magnetic order parameter depends on the reciprocal\nlattice line G and also on whether thermal vibrations are incorporated (W=WD) or ignored\n(W=0). Thus, the experimental magnetic order parameter obtained from Eq.9a must be\nrepresented as\n\n/ ,\n\nand that obtained from Eq.9b must be represented as\n\n/\n\n, 0 . The theoretical magnetic order parameter has no dependence on the reciprocal lattice\nvector, G, but depends on whether thermal vibrations are incorporated (W=WD) or ignored\n(W=0). Thus, the theoretical magnetic order parameter obtained from Eq.5 must be represented\nas\n\n/ ,\n\nand that obtained from Eq.1 must be represented as\n\n/ ,0 .\n\nThe above results are summarized in Table 1. It is clearly seen that comparisons between\ntheoretical and experimental magnetic order parameters can only be between Eq.5 \u2013 Eq.9a and\nEq.1 \u2013 Eq.9b, since they would be under the same assumption. In Eq.9a, all reciprocal lattice\nlines G give the same (single) value of the magnetic order parameter that must be compared with\n\n7\n\n\fthe single value predicted from Eq.5. In Eq.9b, different lines G will give different values of the\nmagnetic order parameter which must be compared with a single value predicted from Eq.1. This\nis clearly unacceptable and is further discussed later. The current practice of comparing the\npredicted magnetic order parameter from Eq.1 with the experimental magnetic order parameter\nobtained from Eq.9a (as both give single-valued order parameter) is incorrect as they have been\nobtained under different assumptions and is clearly evident from Table 1.\n\n/ , 0 must be compared\n\nHowever, since current models are based on Eq.1, it is clear that\n\n/ , 0 . We present a simple method that involves minimum disruption of the\n\nonly with\n\n/ ,\n\ncurrent practice of comparing the predictions of Eq.1 with\n\n. If the experimentally\n/ ,\n\ndetermined error due to neglect of thermal vibrations is reported along with\ninformation is equivalent to comparing\n\n/ , 0 with\n\n, this\n\n/ ,0 .\n\nThe percentage error due to the neglect of thermal vibrations is readily seen to be\n\n%\n\n,\n\n1\n\n/ ,0\n/ ,\n\n100\n\n1\n\n,\n\n100\n\n(10)\n\nThe error in Eq.10 is always positive and neglecting the role of thermal vibrations (Eq.9b) leads\nto magnetic order parameter that is always lower than that obtained by incorporating them\n(Eq.9a). This error subtracted from the correct value of the magnetic order parameter, \u03b7\nT , WD , gives \u03b7\n\nT/T , 0 which must be compared with \u03b7\n8\n\nT/\n\nT/T , 0 . Therefore, as a matter\n\n\fof scientific correctness this error must always be reported in all experimental analysis of\nneutron diffraction data since it reflects that both theoretical models and experimental analysis\nhave ignored thermal vibrations. It is stressed that this comparison is still scientifically\nunacceptable since different reciprocal lines G give different magnetic order parameter values.\n\nFrom the second equality in Eq.10, it is clear that it is unnecessary to know the absolute value of\neither of two magnetic order parameters in order to determine the percentage error. In addition,\n,\n\nthe accurate determination of\n\nby any diffraction technique can be used to estimate the\n\npercentage error in the magnetic order parameter when thermal vibrations are ignored. The\nadvantage of this feature will become clearer when specific systems are discussed below. Since\n,\n\nis always determined during the analysis of neutron diffraction data, the error can be\n\nreadily determined without performing any new experiments. As is well known [2,3,18], the\nDWF,\n\n,\n\n, is given by\n\n8\n\nwhere\n\nsin\n\nsin\n\n(11)\n\nis the mean-squared displacement and B(T) is the isotropic temperature factor. From\n\nEq.10 and Eq.11 it is clear that the error depends on the reciprocal lattice line G and the\ntemperature of interest. The error will be largest near the critical temperature for any given\nreciprocal lattice line G and for a fixed temperature will increase with increasing |G|2. Since, the\nfirst reciprocal lattice line occurs at a finite value of |G|2, a minimum error due to the neglect of\nthermal vibrations will always be present. Since the mean-squared displacement,\n\n9\n\n, or the\n\n\fisotropic temperature factor, B(T), increase with temperature, the error in magnetic systems with\nhigher transition temperatures will be higher than in systems with lower transition temperatures.\n\nAs is well known [4,19-23], the transition metal oxides, MnO, CoO and NiO are prototype\nsystems to study anti-ferromagnetism. These systems have been well studied and accurate\ndiffraction data are available for these systems. We calculate the errors for these oxides when\ntheir experimental magnetic order parameters have to be compared with predictions made from\nstatic lattice prototype Heisenberg models based on Eq.1. We use the data from Ref.20-22 as the\nvalue of the mean-square amplitude at room temperature for CoO in Ref.20 (UCo = 0.00518 A2)\nis also independently confirmed in a polarized neutron diffraction study (UCo = 0.0050 A2) by a\ndifferent group [23]. In Ref.20-22, the data are reported for MnO at 15 K and 295 K (far away\nfrom TN), for CoO at 10 K and 305 K and for NiO at 10 K and 550 K. For CoO and NiO, the\nhigh temperature data are just above the Neel temperature of 293 K and 523 K respectively.\nUsing the well known assumption that at high temperatures, DWF varies linearly with\ntemperature, a 5% reduction is made in the mean-square displacement values reported in Ref.20\nand Ref.22 so that they represent the displacements very close to the Neel temperature. Thus,\nUCo = 0.00492 A2 (~ TN) and UNi = 0.00594 A2 (~ TN) are used. Table 2a summarizes the error\ndue to the neglect of thermal vibrations in MnO, CoO and NiO at very low temperatures and near\nTN. They vary from 0.5% - 4.5% depending on the temperature and the superlattice line G.\n\nTable 2b summarizes the errors due to the neglect of thermal vibrations in ferrimagnetic NiFe2O4\nwith a TN ~ 860 K. The data is taken from Ref.24 and Ref.25 and Biso(850 K) is obtained from\n10\n\n\flinear extrapolation of Biso(300 K) in Ref.25. The reciprocal lattice lines have been chosen to\nhave majority contribution from magnetic scattering and in particular for (331) the entire\nintensity is due to magnetic scattering [24]. The errors due to neglect of thermal vibrations are\nunacceptably large near TN. In particular, for systems where TN is high, the error analysis shows\nthat the assumption of constant exchange integral is likely to be incorrect. Hence for spinel\nferrites where TN is high (~ 800 K), the long standing practice [26] of extracting constant\nexchange interaction parameters from experimental data using mean-field models must be\nmodified to have temperature dependent exchange interactions.\n\nAll superlattice lines give a single-valued order parameter in the correct analysis of neutron\ndiffraction data, Eq.8. This is experimentally confirmed for the first two superlattice lines for\norder-disorder transition in the alloy beta-brass [27]. For the assumption that thermal vibrations\ncan be ignored, the different errors for different lines G in Table 2 must be subtracted from the\ncorrect single-valued parameter in order to compare theoretical and experimental order\nparameters. This leads to multiple-valued experimental order parameters, one from each\nreciprocal line G. Alternately, the multiple values of the order parameter arise from the fact that\nit can be determined from each superlattice line by setting W=0 in the correct expression, Eq.8.\nCrucially, these multiple values are equally valid since Eq.8 is valid for all lines G. This is a\nconceptually very different condition from the routine practice of neglecting physical phenomena\nthat contribute negligibly to the problem under consideration. For example, ignoring DWF in\nEq.3 leads to band gaps in semiconductors that are in error at finite temperatures but they are still\nsingle-valued. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a unique consequence, viz.\nan assumption of neglect of a physical phenomenon turns a single-valued experimentally\n11\n\n\fobservable quantity into a multiple-valued one and where all values are equally valid. Therefore,\nthis feature must be considered while judging the validity of the assumption (that thermal\nvibrations can be ignored) in addition to the usual feature of the magnitude of the errors caused\nby it. While it is acceptable to neglect physical phenomena that contribute negligibly as long as\nsingle-valued experimental observables remain single-valued, it is clearly unacceptable if it turns\na single-valued experimental observable into a multiple-valued one. It is unacceptable even when\nthe errors are relatively small e.g., Table2a, and can be acceptable only when errors are\nvanishingly small, in which case the multiple values become a single value for all practical\npurposes.\n\nThus, the only scientifically acceptable comparison is the one between theoretical models based\non Eq.5 with diffraction data analyzed as per Eq.9a, i.e. both incorporating the role of thermal\nvibrations. Hence, analysis of neutron diffraction data constrains the wavefunctions to be\ntemperature dependent and must be represented as \u03c8i(T). It follows that the exchange interaction\nis also constrained to be temperature dependent, Jij(T), by neutron diffraction data. This result is\nentirely consistent with high temperature electronic structure theory. We provide additional\nexperimental and theoretical evidences that support the above conclusion.\n\nAn isotope effect due to zero-point vibrations is predicted to be a general feature [10] and has\nalso been experimentally confirmed [28-30]. Recently, an isotope effect has been found [31] in\nan organic antiferromagnet that shifts TN (~ 2.5 K) by 4%. The authors attribute the lowering of\nTN to a reduction in the overlap of electronic wavefunction (or weaker exchange interaction)\n12\n\n\fcaused by smaller zero-point mean-square vibration amplitudes for the heavier isotope [31]. A\nsimilar explanation has also been given for the observed 0.6% isotope effect [32] in\nantiferromagnetic La2CuO4 (TN ~ 310). The isotope effect is due to different zero-point\nvibrational amplitudes of different isotopes. As the temperature increases, the difference between\nvibrational amplitudes diminishes [10]. Therefore, one reason for the smaller isotope effect of\n0.6% in La2CuO4 could be the high TN (~ 310 K).\n\nFrom the above experimental results, it is clear that the observed isotope effect cannot be\nexplained by models based on Eq.1. Also, the TN predicted from Eq.1 that ignores thermal\nvibrations is likely to be in serious error since the difference J (u 2 ) \u2212 J (0) is much larger than\nJ (u12 ) \u2212 J (u22 ) that results in the 4% shift in TN. Thus, only models based on Eq.5 can explain the\nabove observed isotope effects.\n\nIn addition, microscopic theoretical models exist that suggest the same conclusion. For\nferromagnetism in metals, a theoretical model for the temperature dependence of the effective\nexchange integral, Ieff, has been proposed [33] and the author concludes that \"at high\ntemperatures Ieff may be considerably smaller than at low temperatures.\"\n\nIn the case of insulators, a phonon mediated superexchange mechanism has been proposed [3436]. This is a lattice dynamic effect and not due to Jahn-Teller interactions. An expression for the\nexchange intergral at finite temperatures has been derived as [34-36]\n13\n\n\f\u2044\n\n1\n\n(12)\n\nwhere J0 is the Heisenberg exchange at 0 K, i.e. Jij(0) in Eq.1, and KJ is the spin-lattice coupling\nconstant. Importantly, even at low temperatures, the zero-point contributions are found to be\nsignificant. This prediction is confirmed by the isotope effect in magnetism due to zero-point\nvibrations mentioned above.\n\nThus, the observed isotope effect [31,32] and the theory of phonon mediated superexchange [3436] suggest that even when vibration amplitudes are relatively small at low temperatures, the\nexchange integral must be represented as temperature dependent, Jij(T). This is completely\nconsistent with our conclusion based on the analysis of neutron diffraction data that as a general\nprinciple, the exchange interaction must be represented to be temperature dependent, Jij(T), and\nEq.5 must replace Eq.1 as the prototype model for magnetic phase transitions.\n\nIn conclusion, we have addressed and resolved the fundamental contradiction that has existed\nfrom the earliest studies on magnetic phase transitions between theoretical models that ignore the\nrole of thermal vibrations and represent the exchange interaction as a constant, Jij(0), and\nanalysis of neutron diffraction data that always incorporates thermal vibrations even though it is\nalso possible to analyze the same data by ignoring them. Ignoring thermal vibrations in both\ntheoretical models and analysis of diffraction data leads to the latter giving different magnetic\norder parameters for different reciprocal lattice lines. This appears to be the first report of a\n14\n\n\funique consequence, viz. the assumption to neglect a physical phenomenon turns a single-valued\nexperimental observable into a multiple-valued one where all values are equally valid. This\nassumption is clearly unacceptable and must be rejected. The second possibility of incorporating\nthermal vibrations in both leads to single-valued theoretical and experimental order parameters.\nThus, analysis of neutron diffraction data constrain the exchange interaction in all theoretical\nmodels to be temperature dependent and represented as Jij(T). Additional experimental and\ntheoretical evidences in support of this conclusion are presented.\n\n1. N. W. Ashcroft and N. D. Mermin, Solid State Physics (Harcourt, New York 1976)\n2. W.
