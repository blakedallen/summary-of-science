A general formalism for understanding the thermodynamics of\nhorizons in spherically symmetric spacetimes is developed. The formalism\nreproduces known results in the case of black hole spacetimes and can handle\nmore general situations like: (i) spacetimes which are not asymptotically flat (like\nthe de Sitter spacetime) and (ii) spacetimes with multiple horizons having different\ntemperatures (like the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime) and provide a consistent\ninterpretation for temperature, entropy and energy. I show that it is possible\nto write Einstein's equations for a spherically symmetric spacetime in the form\nT dS \u2212 dE = P dV near any horizon of radius a with S = (1/4)(4\u03c0a2 ), |E| = (a/2)\nand the temperature T determined from the surface gravity at the horizon. The\npressure P is provided by the source of the Einstein's equations and dV is the\nchange in the volume when the horizon is displaced infinitesimally. The same\nresults can be obtained by evaluating the quantum mechanical partition function\nwithout using Einstein's equations or WKB approximation for the action. Both\nthe classical and quantum analysis provide a simple and consistent interpretation\nof entropy and energy for de Sitter spacetime as well as for (1 + 2) dimensional\ngravity. For the Rindler spacetime the entropy per unit transverse area turns out\nto be (1/4) while the energy is zero. The approach also shows that the de Sitter\nhorizon - like the Schwarzschild horizon - is effectively one dimensional as far as\nthe flow of information is concerned, while the Schwarzschild-de Sitter, ReissnerNordstrom horizons are not.

The need for local description of horizon thermodynamics\nThis paper provides a classical and quantum description of a mini superspace of\nspacetimes which are spherically symmetric. Since the subject of thermodynamics\nof horizons has nearly three decades of history, it is probably best if I begin with\na detailed description of motivation. Readers interested in concrete results can skip\nahead to section 2.\nThe best studied spacetimes with horizons are black hole spacetimes [1], [2]. In\nthe simplest context of a Schwarzschild black hole of mass M , one can attribute an\nenergy E = M , temperature T = (8\u03c0M )\u22121 and entropy S = (1/4)(AH /L2P ) where\nAH is the area of the horizon and LP = (Gh\u0304/c3 )1/2 is the Planck length. (Hereafter,\nI will use units with G = h\u0304 = c = 1.) These are clearly related by the thermodynamic\nidentity T dS = dE, usually called the first law of black hole dynamics. This result has\nbeen obtained in much more general contexts and has been investigated from many\ndifferent points of view in the literature. The simplicity of the result depends on the\nfollowing features: (a) The Schwarzschild metric is a vacuum solution with no pressure\nso that there is no P dV term in the first law of thermodynamics. (b) The metric has\nonly one parameter M so that changes in all physical parameters can be related to\ndM . (c) Most importantly, there is a well defined notion of energy E to the spacetime\nand the changes in the energy dE can be interpreted in terms of the physical process\nof the black hole evaporation. (One can also interpret the relations by, say, dropping\n\"test particles\" into the black hole but it is really not necessary.) The idea can be\ngeneralized to other black hole spacetimes in a rather simple manner only because of\nwell defined notions of energy, angular momentum etc.\nCan one generalize the thermodynamics of horizons to cases other than black holes\nin a straight forward way ? In spite of years of research in this field, this generalization\nremains non trivial and challenging when the conditions listed above are not satisfied.\nTo see the importance of the above conditions, we only need to contrast the situation\nin Schwarzschild spacetime with that of de Sitter spacetime and observe that:\n(1) The notion of temperature is well defined in the case of de Sitter spacetime\nsince the de Sitter horizon also radiates like a black body; we have T = H/2\u03c0 where\nH \u22121 is the radius of the de Sitter horizon. (The same result can be obtained more\nformally in terms of the periodicity in the Euclidean time). But the correspondence\nprobably ends there. A study of literature shows that there exist very few concrete\ncalculations of energy, entropy and laws of horizon dynamics in the case of de Sitter\nspacetimes, in sharp contrast to BH space times.\n(2) There have been several attempts in the literature to define the concept of\nenergy using local or quasi-local concepts (for a small sub sample of ten references, see\n[3]). The problem is that not all definitions of energy (or even definitions of horizon;\nsee [8]) agree with each other and not all of them can be applied to de Sitter type\nuniverses.\n(3) Even when a notion of energy can be defined, it is not clear how to write and\ninterpret an equation analogous to dS = (dE/T ) in this spacetime, especially since the\nphysical basis for dE would require a notion of evaporation of the de Sitter universe.\n(4) Further, we know that de Sitter spacetime is a solution to Einstein's equations\nwith a source having non zero pressure. Hence one would very much doubt whether\nT dS is indeed equal to dE. It would be necessary to add a P dV term for consistency.\nAn argument is sometimes advanced that de Sitter horizon is conceptually\ndifferent from black hole horizon because it is observer dependent. I believe this\n\n\fClassical and quantum thermodynamics of horizons\n\n3\n\nargument is incorrect and that all horizons (including even Rindler horizon) should\nbe treated on par because of at least three reasons (see [4] [5] for more details): (i) To\nbegin with, if the notion of entropy in black hole spacetimes is not accidental, then one\nwould expect any one-way-membrane which blocks out information to lead to a notion\nof entropy [5]. (ii) As regards observer dependence, even in the case of Schwarzschild\nspacetimes, it is possible to have observers moving in time-like trajectories inside the\nevent horizon who will access part of the information which is not available to the\noutside observer. It seems unlikely that these suicidal observers will attribute the\nsame amount of entropy to the Schwarzschild black hole as an observer playing it safe\nby staying far away from the event horizon. (iii) If the notion of entropy associated\nwith a one way membrane arises from local degrees of freedom and Planck scale physics,\nour inability to define a global notion of energy should not have a bearing on the issue\nof entropy.\nAll these suggest that there must be a local approach by which one can define\nthe notion of entropy and energy for spacetimes with horizons. This conclusion\nis strengthened further by the following argument: Consider a class of spherically\nsymmetric spacetimes of the form\nds2 = f (r)dt2 \u2212 f (r)\u22121 dr2 \u2212 r2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 )\n\u2032\n\n(1)\n\nIf f (r) has a simple zero at r = a with f (a) \u2261 B remaining finite, then this spacetime\nhas a horizon at r = a. Spacetimes like Schwarzschild or de Sitter have only one\nfree parameter in the metric (like M or H \u22121 ) and hence the scaling of all other\nthermodynamical parameters is uniquely fixed by purely dimensional considerations.\nBut, for a general metric of the form in (1), with an arbitrary f (r), the area of the\nhorizon (and hence the entropy) is determined by the location of the zero of the\nfunction f (r) while the temperature - obtained from the periodicity considerations\n- is determined by the value of f \u2032 (r) at the zero. For a general function, of course,\nthere will be no relation between the location of the zero and the slope of the function\nat that point. It will, therefore, be incredible if there exists any a priori relationship\nbetween the temperature (determined by f \u2032 ) and the entropy (determined by the\nzero of f ) even in the context of horizons in spherically symmetric spacetimes. If\nwe take the entropy to be S = \u03c0a2 (where f (a) = 0 determines the radius of the\nhorizon) and the temperature to be T = |f \u2032 (a)|/4\u03c0 (determined by the periodicity of\nEuclidean time), the quantity T dS = (1/2)|f \u2032 (a)|ada will depend both on the slope\nf \u2032 (a) as well as the radius of the horizon. This implies that any local interpretation\nof thermodynamics will be quite non trivial.\nFinally, the need for local description of thermodynamics of horizons becomes\ncrucial in the case of spacetimes with multiple horizons. Let me briefly describe this\nsituation relegating the details to Appendix Appendix A. The strongest and the\nmost robust result we have, regarding spacetimes with a horizon, is the notion of\ntemperature associated with them. This, in turn, depends either on a complicated\nanalysis of the mode functions of a wave equation, Bogoliubov coefficients etc. or\non the study of the periodicity of the Euclidean time coordinate. Neither approach\nworks very well if the spacetime has more than one horizon like, for example, in the\nSchwarzschild-de Sitter metric which has the form in (1) with\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2M\n2 2\n(2)\n\u2212H r\nf (r) = 1 \u2212\nr\n\n\fClassical and quantum thermodynamics of horizons\n\n4\n\nThis spacetime has two horizons at r\u00b1 with\nr\nr\nx + 4\u03c0\nx\n4 \u22121\n4 \u22121\nr+ =\nH cos\n; r\u2212 =\nH cos\n(3)\n3\n3\n3\n3\n\u221a\nwhere cos x = \u22123 3M H \u22121 . (The parameter x is in the range (\u03c0, (3/2)\u03c0] and\n0 \u2264 27M 2 H \u22122 < 1.) Close to either horizon the spacetime can be approximated\nas Rindler. Since the surface gravities on the two horizons are different, we get two\ndifferent Rindler temperatures T\u00b1 = |f \u2032 (r\u00b1 )|/4\u03c0. It is also possible to introduce two\ndifferent Kruskal like coordinates using the two surface gravities in which the metric is\nwell behaved at the horizons (see Appendix A for details; for related work, see [6]). In\nthe (1+1) case, it is possible to introduce the analogs of Boulware and Hartle-Hawking\nvacuum states with either of these transformations. In the overlapping region of the\ncoordinate patches, however, there is no simple notion of temperature.\nThis point is brought in quite dramatically when we study the periodicity in the\nimaginary time in the overlapping region of the two Kruskal coordinates. To maintain\ninvariance under it \u2192 it + \u03b2 (with some finite \u03b2) it is necessary that \u03b2 is an integer\nmultiple of both 4\u03c0/|f \u2032 (r+ )| and 4\u03c0/|f \u2032 (r\u2212 )| so that \u03b2 = (4\u03c0n\u00b1 /|f \u2032 (r\u00b1 )|) where n\u00b1\nare integers. Hence the ratio of surface gravities |f \u2032 (r+ )|/|f \u2032 (r\u2212 )| = (n+ /n\u2212 ) must\nbe a rational number. Though irrationals can be approximated by rationals, such a\ncondition definitely excludes a class of values for M if H is specified and vice versa. It\nis not clear why the existence of a cosmological constant should imply something for\nthe masses of black holes (or vice versa). Since there is no physical basis for such a\ncondition, it seems reasonable to conclude that these difficulties arise because of our\ndemanding the existence of a finite periodicity \u03b2 in the Euclidean time coordinate.\nThis demand is related to an expectation of thermal equilibrium which is violated in\nspacetimes with multiple horizons having different temperatures.\nIf even the simple notion of temperature falls apart in the presence of multiple\nhorizons, it is not likely that the notion of energy or entropy can be defined by global\nconsiderations. On the other hand, it will be equally strange if we cannot attribute\na temperature to a black hole formed in some region of the universe just because the\nuniverse at the largest scales is described by a de Sitter spacetime, say. One is again\nled to searching for a local description of the thermodynamics of all types of horizons.\nThe results in this paper have bearing on all these important issues. One of the\nkey results of this paper will be to provide a consistent interpretation of the relation\nT dS \u2212 dE = P dV in the case of de Sitter universe. To the extent I know, this has not\nbeen done before in any of the published literature, explicitly, giving an expression for\nthe energy in the de Sitter universe. I obtain the result E = \u2212(1/2)H \u22121 by three\nseparate arguments and these arguments work consistently for (1+2) dimensional\nspacetime as well. I will also show [in section 2] that one can use Einstein's constraint\nequations to relate f \u2032 (r) with r and thus provide a simple interpretation for the\nexpression T dS. [The constraint equation arises essentially from the symmetries of\nthe Einstein-Hilbert action under coordinate transformations and can be imposed as\na constraint on physical states even in quantum theory.]\n2. Einstein's equations as a thermodynamic identity\nThe key idea developed in this Section is to use the notion of periodicity in Euclidean\ntime (obtained by a local Rindler approximation near the horizon) to define the\ntemperature, without any ambiguity in the proportionality constant, and then to\n\n\fClassical and quantum thermodynamics of horizons\n\n5\n\nrewrite Einstein's equations in a form analogous to the T dS \u2212 dE = P dV equation. I\nwill show that it is fairly straight forward to achieve this in the case of spacetimes of\nthe form:\nds2 = f (r)dt2 \u2212 f (r)\u22121 dr2 \u2212 r2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 )\n\u2261 f (r)dt2 \u2212 f (r)\u22121 dr2 \u2212 dL2\u22a5\n\n(4)\n\nwith a general f (r) determined via Einstein's equations.\nThis metric will satisfy Einstein's equations provided the the source stress tensor\nhas the form\n\u01eb(r)\n\u03bc(r)\nTtt = Trr =\n; T\u03b8\u03b8 = T\u03c6\u03c6 =\n(5)\n8\u03c0\n8\u03c0\nThe equality Ttt = Trr arises from our assumption g00 = (\u22121/g11 ) and can be relaxed\nif g00 6= (\u22121/g11). (It will turn out that our analysis goes through even in this more\ngeneral case and I will comment about it in the next section.) The equality T\u03b8\u03b8 = T\u03c6\u03c6\narises from spherical symmetry. The equation (5) also defines the functions \u01eb(r) and\n\u03bc(r). The Einstein's equations now reduce to:\nf\u2032\n1\n(1 \u2212 f ) \u2212\n= \u01eb; \u22072 f = \u22122\u03bc\n(6)\n2\nr\nr\nThe remarkable feature about the metric in (4) is that the Einstein's equations become\nlinear in f (r) so that solutions for different \u01eb(r) can be superposed. (I could not find\nthis result in standard textbooks.) Given any \u01eb(r) the solution becomes\nZ\na 1 r\n\u01eb(r)r2 dr\n(7)\nf (r) = 1 \u2212 \u2212\nr\nr a\n\nwith a being an integration constant and \u03bc(r) is fixed by \u01eb(r) through:\n1\n\u03bc(r) = \u01eb + r\u01eb\u2032 (r)\n(8)\n2\nI have chosen the integration constant a in (7) such that f (r) = 0 at r = a so that this\nsurface is a horizon. It is, of course, quite possible for f (r) to vanish at other values\nof r if there are multiple horizons in the spacetime. Given any \u01eb(r), the two equations\n(7) and (8) give a classical solution to Einstein's equations with (at least) one horizon\nat r = a.\nOne can easily verify that: (i) \u01eb = 0 implies \u03bc = 0 and leads to Schwarzschild\nspacetime; (ii) \u01eb = \u01eb0 = constant requires \u03bc = \u01eb0 and Tba \u221d dia (\u01eb0 , \u03bc0 , \u03bc0 , \u03bc0 ) and\nleads to\n\u01eb 0 a3\n\u01eb0\nA\n; B=\n(9)\nf (r) = 1 \u2212 \u2212 Br2 ; A = a \u2212\nr\n3\n3\nThis represents the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime and when a = 0 it reduces\nto the de Sitter spacetime; (iii) \u01eb = (Q2 /r4 ) + \u01eb0 gives \u03bc = \u2212(Q2 /r4 ) + \u01eb0 which\ncorresponds to a Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter metric. In fact, the linearity of\nEinstein's equations (6) allows superposition of different \u01eb and one can build all these\nsolutions by superposition.\nLet us now assume that the solution (7) is such that f (r) = 0 at r = ai , i = 1, 2, ....\nwith f \u2032 (ai ) = Bi finite. Then near r = ai the metric can be expanded in a Taylor\nseries with f (r) \u2248 Bi (r \u2212 ai ). If there are multiple horizons, such expansion is possible\nnear each zero of f and I will suppress the subscript i and just denote by the symbols a\nand B the corresponding values for each horizon. If only one horizon is present, then\n\n\fClassical and quantum thermodynamics of horizons\n\n6\n\nthe Euclidean time coordinate is periodic with a period \u03b2 = (4\u03c0/|B|) leading to a\nglobal notion of temperature. In the context of multi horizon spacetimes, it is natural\nto endow each horizon with a locally defined temperature Ti = |Bi |/4\u03c0. This can be\ndefined precisely in the context of multi horizon spacetimes by considering the metric\nnear each horizon and identifying the local Rindler temperature or by developing the\nquantum field theory. (See Appendix Appendix A; in the case of a multi horizon\nspacetime, there is, of course, no notion of a global equilibrium temperature.) From\nthe first of the equations (6) evaluated at r = a, we get\n1\n(10)\nf \u2032 (a) = \u2212 \u01eb(a)a = B\na\nor,\n1\n1\n1\nBa \u2212 = \u2212 \u01eb(a)a2\n(11)\n2\n2\n2\nIt is possible to provide an interesting interpretation of this equation which throws\nlight on the notion of entropy and energy. Multiplying the above equation by da and\nusing \u01eb = 8\u03c0Trr , it is trivial to rewrite equation (11) in the form\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n1\nB\n1\n4\u03c0 3\nd\n4\u03c0a2 \u2212 da = \u2212 Trr (a)d\na\n4\u03c0\n4\n2\n3\n= \u2212 Trr (a)[4\u03c0a2 ]da\n\n(12)\n\n(It should be remembered that this equation holds separately for each of the horizons\nwith a, B etc. actually standing for ai , Bi , i = 1, 2, ...). Let us first consider the case\nin which a particular horizon has f \u2032 (a) = B > 0 so that the temperature is T = B/4\u03c0.\nSince f (a) = 0, f \u2032 (a) > 0, it follows that f > 0 for r > a and f < 0 for r < a; that\nis, the \"normal region\" in which t is time like is outside the horizon as in the case\nof, for example, the Schwarzschild metric. The first term in the left hand side of (12)\nclearly has the form of T dS since we have an independent identification of temperature\nfrom the periodicity argument in the local Rindler coordinates. Since the pressure is\nP = \u2212Trr , the right hand side has the structure of P dV or - more relevantly - is the\nproduct of the radial pressure times the transverse area times the radial displacement.\nThis is important because, for the metrics in the form (4), the proper transverse area\nis just that of a 2-sphere though the proper volumes and coordinate volumes differ.\nThe product of pressure P times the transverse proper area 4\u03c0a2 gives the correct\nforce; multiplying this force by the [virtual] displacement da gives the [virtual] work\ndone. Hence the relevant quantity is dV = (4\u03c0a2 )da and its integral V = (4\u03c0/3)a3 ,\nsometimes called 'areal volume', is the relevant volume for our analysis. The second\nequality in (12) makes this point clear. [This interpretation is discussed further in\nsubsection (2.3) below.] In the case of horizons with B = f \u2032 (a) > 0 which we are\nconsidering (with da > 0), the volume of the region where f < 0 will increase and\nthe volume of the region where f > 0 will decrease. Since the entropy is due to the\nexistence of an inaccessible region, dV must refer to the change in the volume of the\ninaccessible region where f < 0. [We will see below that consistent interpretation is\npossible for B < 0 case as well.] We can now identify T in T dS and P in P dV without\nany difficulty and interpret the remaining term (second term in the left hand side)\nas dE = da/2. We thus get the expressions for the entropy S and energy E (when\nB > 0) to be\n\u00131/2\n\u0012\n1\n1\nAH\n1\n2\n(13)\nS = (4\u03c0a ) = AH ; E = a =\n4\n4\n2\n16\u03c0\n\n\fClassical and quantum thermodynamics of horizons\n\n7\n\nIn the case of the Schwarzschild black hole with a = 2M , the energy turns out to\nbe E = (a/2) = M which is as expected. More generally, E = (Ahorizon /16\u03c0)1/2\ncorresponds to the so called 'irreducible mass' in black hole spacetimes [7]. Of course,\nthe identifications S = (4\u03c0M 2 ), E = M , T = (1/8\u03c0M ) are consistent with the\nresult dE = T dS in this particular case since the pressure vanishes. As I said before,\nreproducing this result for black holes is not so significant, because much more formal\nand general results exist in the case of black hole thermodynamics. What is significant\nis the fact that our analysis is completely local and did not use any feature regarding\nasymptotic flatness etc even to define the energy.\n2.1. Energy of the de Sitter horizon\nThis aspect becomes clearer when we study a horizon which is not associated with\na black hole, viz. de Sitter horizon. There is considerable interest in this spacetime\nrecently but no clear formulation of \"laws\" analogous to laws of black hole dynamics\nexist in this context (Except possibly for one approach, based on the concept of isolated\nhorizons, that attempts to provide such an analysis [8] using a very specific definition\nfor spacetime horizons.) Equation (12), however, can easily provide an interpretation\nof entropy and energy in the case of de Sitter universe. In this case, f (r) = (1 \u2212 H 2r2 ),\na = H \u22121 , B = \u22122H < 0 so that the temperature - which should be positive - is\nT = |f \u2032 (a)|/(4\u03c0) = (\u2212B)/4\u03c0. For horizons with B = f \u2032 (a) < 0 (like the de Sitter\nhorizon) which we are now considering, f (a) = 0, f \u2032 (a) < 0, and it follows that f > 0\nfor r < a and f < 0 for r > a; that is, the \"normal region\" in which t is time like\nis inside the horizon as in the case of, for example, the de Sitter metric. Multiplying\nequation (12) by (\u22121), we get\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n1\n\u2212B\n1\n4\u03c0 3\n2\nr\n(14)\nd\n4\u03c0a + da = Tr (a)d\na = P (\u2212dV )\n4\u03c0\n4\n2\n3\nThe first term on the left hand side is again of the form T dS (with positive temperature\nand entropy). The term on the right hand side has the correct sign since the\ninaccessible region (where f < 0) is now outside the horizon and the volume of this\nregion changes by (\u2212dV ). Once again, we can use (14) to identify the entropy and\nthe energy:\n1\n1\n1\nS = (4\u03c0a2 ) = Ahorizon ; E = \u2212 H \u22121\n(15)\n4\n4\n2\nAs a byproduct, our approach provides an interpretation of energy for the\nde Sitter spacetime - an issue which is currently attracting attention - and a\nconsistent thermodynamic interpretation of de Sitter horizon. Our identification,\nE = \u2212(1/2)H \u22121 is also supported by the following argument: If we use the\n\"reasonable\" assumptions S = (1/4)(4\u03c0H \u22122 ), V \u221d H \u22123 and E = \u2212P V in the\nequation T dS \u2212 P dV = dE and treat E as an unknown function of H, we get the\nequation\ndE\n= \u2212(3EH + 1)\n(16)\nH2\ndH\nwhich integrates to give precisely E = \u2212(1/2)H \u22121. Note that I only needed the\nproportionality, V \u221d H \u22123 in this argument since P dV \u221d (dV /V ). The ambiguity\nbetween the coordinate and proper volume is again irrelevant. This energy is also\n\n\fClassical and quantum thermodynamics of horizons\n\n8\n\nnumerically same as the total energy within the coordinate Hubble volume of the\nclassical solution, with a cosmological constant:\n4\u03c0 \u22123\n4\u03c0 \u22123 3H 2\n1\nH \u03c1\u039b =\nH\n= H \u22121\n(17)\n3\n3\n8\u03c0\n2\n(The extra negative sign of E = \u2212EHub is related to a feature noticed in the literature\nin a different context; see for example, the discussion following equation (71) in the\nreview [9]. )\nThere is an interesting feature in this argument which is worth discussing ([10]).\nIf the formal results of black hole dynamics valid for arbitrary matter filled stationary\nspaces containing a horizon [11] are carried over to the de Sitter spacetime, then one\neither obtains E = +(1/2)H \u22121 or E = \u2212H \u22121 . The first one arises essentially due\nto the result in (17) while the second one arises if the effective mass density is taken\nto be (\u03c1 + 3P ). The result obtained above E = \u2212(1/2)H \u22121 differs from both these\nexpressions. It is easy to see that the approach based on Einstein's equations as well\nas the argument given above uses \u03c1 as the relevant energy density and not \u03c1 + 3P\nand hence differs from the result E = \u2212H \u22121 . Settling whether E = +(1/2)H \u22121\nor E = \u2212(1/2)H \u22121 is more subtle because of the following reason. In the case of\na black hole, increase in the area of horizon AH leads to increase in the volume of\ninaccessible region. It therefore makes sense to assume that (dS/dAH ) > 0. In the\ncase of a de Sitter universe, increase in the area of a horizon increases the region\naccessible to the canonical observer in the region r < H \u22121 and thus decreases the\ninaccessible region beyond the horizon. (This notion is not very precise since the\nvolume in the region r > H \u22121 could be divergent.) From this point of view, it may\nbe acceptable to take (dS/dAH ) < 0. This will change the sign in T dS term in\nthe relevant equations and repeating our analysis, straightforward algebra will lead\nto E = (1/2)H \u22121 . This is most easily seen from the argument given in the last\nparagraph. If we take dS = \u2212(1/4)dAH , equation (16) changes to\ndE\nH2\n= \u2212(3EH \u2212 1)\n(18)\ndH\nwhich has the solution E = +(1/2)H \u22121 . So, the choice of E = \u00b1(1/2)H \u22121 is related\nto the choice of dS = \u2213(1/4)dAH .\nI believe the correct result is indeed E = \u2212(1/2)H \u22121 because we expect total\nentropy of a system to be a well defined positive quantity. Integrating the equation\ndS = \u2212(1/4)dAH leads to the result S = (1/4)(A0 \u2212 AH ) with an undetermined\nconstant A0 . This result is hard to interpret since there are no physical quantities\navailable to characterize A0 in these spacetimes and the choice of A0 = 0 will now\nlead to negative entropy. There is nothing wrong in dS being negative but in a\ncomplete thermodynamic description of the spacetime horizon, S has to be positive\nand should not depend on any arbitrary constant.\nWhile (12) gives a consistent interpretation, one may wonder about the\nuniqueness. For example, one could have multiplied the entire equation by an arbitrary\nfunction F (a) which could even differ from horizon to horizon in the case of multihorizon spacetimes. In that case (taking B > 0), the expressions for entropy, energy\nand volume will become:\nZ\nZ\nZ\n1\nS = 2\u03c0F (a)ada; E =\nF (a)da; V = 4\u03c0a2 F (a)da\n(19)\n2\nIt seems reasonable to assume that the cross section area on which the radial pressure\nshould act must be 4\u03c0a2 since it is the proper area in the class of metrics which we\nEHub =\n\n\fClassical and quantum thermodynamics of horizons\n\n9\n\nare considering. Given this criterion, it follows that F (a) = 1. There is no freedom\n- not even that of rescaling - left after this.\n2.2. Results for (1+2) dimensional gravity\nThe ideas also work in the case of (1 + 2) dimensional gravity which has attracted fair\namount of attention (see ref. [12]). For the metrics in (4) with dL2\u22a5 = r2 d\u03b82 , Einstein's\nequations demand that the stress tensor has the form 8\u03c0Tba = dia (\u01eb(r), \u01eb(r), \u03bc(r)).\nThe Einstein's equations are\n1 f\u2032\n1\n\u2212\n= \u01eb(r); \u2212 f \u2032\u2032 (r) = \u03bc(r)\n(20)\n2 r\n2\nThese are also linear in the source term and can be integrated for a given function\n\u01eb(r). The solution is\nZ r\nf (r) = \u22122\ndx x\u01eb(x); \u03bc(r) = (r\u01eb(r))\u2032\n(21)\na\n\nwhere we have again chosen the boundary condition such that f (a) = 0. The relation\nf \u2032 = \u22122r\u01eb evaluated at r = a gives B = \u22122a\u01eb(a). Multiplying by da and rearranging\nterms, this relation can be written in the form\n\u0012 \u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n1\nB\nd\n(2\u03c0a) = (\u2212Trr )(2\u03c0a)da = (\u2212Trr )d(\u03c0a2 )\n(22)\n4\u03c0\n4\n\nWe see that our interpretation carries through in this case as well. Since the\ntemperature is T = (B/4\u03c0) when B > 0 and the pressure is P = \u2212Trr , we can\nimmediately identify the T dS and P dV terms. (The interpretation of the signs\nproceed as in the (1 + 3) case and can be provided for B < 0 situation as well.)\nThe entropy is still one quarter of the \"area\", S = (1/4)2\u03c0a, and the energy vanishes\nidentically: E = 0. The vanishing of energy signifies the fact that at the level of\nthe metric, Einstein's equations are vacuous in (1+2) and we have not incorporated\nany topological effects [like deficit angles corresponding to point masses in (1+2)\ndimensions] in this approach. We will see in section 3 that the same result can be\nobtained from the quantum mechanical evaluation of the partition function.\nIt would have been nice if the analysis can also be extended to metrics of the form\nin (4) with dL2\u22a5 = dy 2 + dz 2 and r interpreted in the range \u2212\u221e < r < +\u221e which will\ninclude the Rindler spacetime when f (r) = (1 + 2gr). This, however, cannot be done\nbecause both the T dS and P dV terms - which are proportional to the transverse\narea - will diverge in this case, making Einstein's equations vacuous. As we shall see\nin section 3, one can get around this difficulty in the quantum formulation which does\nnot rely on Einstein's equations.\n2.3. Interpretation and Comments\nHow does one interpret the differential form of the equation (12) which arises from\nthe Einstein's equations written in the form (11) ? To begin with, we note that this\nequation is purely local and arises from the classical Einstein's equation connecting\nf \u2032 and \u01eb when f vanishes. (Though I used the trick of multiplying by da to get\n(12) one could have got the same result by taking the differential of, say, (11) and\nusing Einstein's equations again.) Therefore any interpretation should be purely local.\nSecond, the differential form of the equation shows how the solution changes if the\nlocation of the horizon is displaced radially. Endowing the horizon with physical\n\n\fClassical and quantum thermodynamics of horizons\n\n10\n\ncharacteristics like entropy, temperature and energy, one can interpret the left hand\nside of (12) as the change in these parameters. The right hand side represents the work\ndone by or against the pressure depending on the sign. This relation is independent\nof how the horizon radius is changed. The standard discussions of first law of black\nhole dynamics, in which a test particle of some mass is made to fall into a black hole,\nsay, is just one way of effecting the change in the horizon size; black hole evaporation\ncould provide another process leading to such a change. The formalism does not care\nwhat causes the change of the horizon radius. [For a different approach in interpreting\nEinstein's equations as a thermodynamic identity see [13],[5].]\nThe same result can be stated more formally along these lines: In standard\nthermodynamics, we can consider two equilibrium states of a system differing\ninfinitesimally in the extensive variables volume, energy and entropy by dV, dE and\ndS while having same values for the intensive variables temperature (T ) and pressure\n(P ). Then, the first law of thermodynamics asserts that T dS = P dV + dE for these\nstates. In a similar vein, we can consider two spherically symmetric solutions to\nEinstein's equations with the radius of the horizon differing by da while having the\nsame source Tik and the same value for B. Then the entropy and energy will be\ninfinitesimally different for these two spacetimes; but the fact that both spacetimes\nsatisfy Einstein's equations shows that T dS and dE will be related to the external\nsource Tik and da by equation (12). Just as in standard thermodynamics, this relation\ncould be interpreted as connecting a sequence of quasi-static equilibrium states. The\nmathematical description does not distinguish between the 'active' interpretation in\nwhich the pressure is considered to have done some work against expansion or the\n'passive' interpretation in which one is comparing the changes in S, V, E of two\ninfinitesimally different states. [It should be stressed that, in any thermodynamic\ndescription of horizons, P does not refer to the pressure of the radiation emitted by\nthe horizon. This is clear from the fact that, in the case of Schwarzschild spacetime\nwith Tik = 0, we have T dS = dE though the Hawking radiation will indeed have some\npressure.]\nIn fact, the virtue of the formalism is not in handling black hole spacetimes with\nsingle horizon - for which much more sophisticated, formal and generally covariant\napproach and results are available [1] - but in its ability to handle spacetimes like\nde Sitter universe, Schwarzschild-de Sitter universe etc. which have horizons not\nassociated with black holes. Compared to black hole horizons, we have much less\nunderstanding of the dynamics of other horizons. (For example, there is no simple\nanalog of the four laws of black hole dynamics in the de Sitter spacetime or to the\nSchwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime.) In the local interpretation advocated here, I will\nconsider E to be the energy of the horizon rather then the energy of the spacetime\ngeometry defined asymptotically etc. Thus Ei , Si and Ti are defined and attributed\nto each horizon and Pi dVi = Pi (4\u03c0a2i )dai is the work done due to the pressure acting\non the transverse proper area of the horizon. The entire description is local and\nallows the formalism to be extended to spacetimes with any number of horizons.\nVirtual displacements of each of the horizon in spherically symmetric spacetimes has\nto satisfy the relationship (12). Each horizon comes with its own temperature, entropy\nand energy.\nThe analysis is classical except for the crucial periodicity argument which is used\nto identify the temperature uniquely. This is again done locally by approximating\nthe metric by a Rindler metric close to the horizon and identifying the Rindler\ntemperature. (This idea bypasses the difficulties in defining and normalizing Killing\n\n\fClassical and quantum thermodynamics of horizons\n\n11\n\nvectors in spacetimes which are not asymptotically flat). Without this quantum\nmechanical ingredient one will not be able to fix the constant of proportionality\nbetween surface gravity and temperature. In normal units, equation (12) should read\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 c4\n1\nc4 B\n2\nd\n4\u03c0a \u2212\nda = \u2212Trr (a)[4\u03c0a2 ]da\n(23)\nG 4\u03c0\n4\n2G\n\nThe second term on the left hand side and the right hand side have the correct\ndimensions for each factor. In the first term on the left hand side, multiplying and\ndividing by h\u0304 allows us to write\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nc4 B\nc3 Bh\u0304c\nA\n1\n1\nd\n4\u03c0a2 =\nd\n4\u03c0a2 = T d( 2 )\n(24)\nG 4\u03c0\n4\nGh\u0304 4\u03c0\n4\n4LP\nwith T = (Bh\u0304c/4\u03c0) being the temperature in energy units. It is obvious that\nquantum mechanics enters only through the factor h\u0304 which appears in expressing\nthe temperature in terms of the surface gravity. Of course, one needs h\u0304 along with G\nand c to obtain a quantity with dimensions of area.\nOne can extend much of this analysis to a slightly more general case in which\ng00 = f1 (r) and g11 = \u22121/f2 (r) with f1 6= f2 in a fairly straightforward manner.\nUsing the relevant Einstein's equations for this case, simple algebra shows that: (i) At\nthe horizon, both f1 and f2 will vanish, (ii) Ttt = Trr at the horizon, though in general\nthey are not equal and (iii) equation (11) is satisfied. To prove (i) let us assume that\nf2 (r) = 0 at some r = a for the first time as we approach from the right and f1 (r) > 0\nat r > a. If f1 (r) > 0 at r = a, then t direction will remain time like and (\u03b8, \u03c6)\ndirections will be space like at r = a. But since the horizon at r = a must be a\nnull surface, it must have a null tangent direction and symmetry requires this to be\nthe t direction. Hence f1 must vanish at r = a. Using the behaviour of Einstein's\nequations it is also possible to prove the converse: that is, if f1 (r) = 0 at r = a, then\nf2 (r) = 0 at r = a. The result (ii) can be proved by expanding f1 (r), f2 (r) around\nr = a with derivatives B1 , B2 at r = a and substituting into the expression for the\nscalar curvature. The scalar curvature will be finite at r = a only if Ttt = Trr at the\nhorizon. Using (ii) in the Einstein's equations will lead to (iii). Thus the only non\ntrivial assumption used in the above analysis is that of spherical symmetry.\n2.4. Dimensionality of horizons\nIncidentally, this analysis throws light on another issue, viz., the effective dimension\nof the horizon. Bekenstein and Mayo have argued [14] that the horizon of the\nSchwarzschild black hole is effectively one dimensional. The argument relies on the\nfact that the rate of flow, \u1e60, of entropy or information in a channel with power P scales\nas \u1e60 \u221d P 1/2 for an one dimensional channel, independent of other details. For higher\ndimensional channels it is not possible to obtain the unique index of (1/2) in the above\nrelation. In the case of a blackbody radiation emerging from a surface of area A and\ntemperature T , we have \u1e60 \u221d AT 3 while P \u221d AT 4 . In general, there is no relation\nbetween A and T and one cannot relate \u1e60 to P. In the case of spherically symmetric\nspacetimes with horizons considered above, A \u221d a2 and T 3 \u221d |f \u2032 (a)|3 \u221d B 3 . Taking\n\u1e60 \u221d B 3 a2 , P \u221d B 4 a2 and using (11) it follows that\n\u1e60\n\u221a \u221d |B|a = |1 \u2212 a2 \u01eb(a)|\nP\n\n(25)\n\n\fClassical and quantum thermodynamics of horizons\n\n12\n\nTherefore Bekenstein's result can be generalized to any spacetime in which \u01eb(a)\nvanishes or is proportional to a\u22122 . The de Sitter universe is an example of the latter\ncase for which \u01eb(a)a2 = 3 allowing us to conclude that pure de Sitter horizon is\nalso of effective one dimension. Equation (25) shows that the result does not extend\nto other cases like, for example, the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime or even the\nReissner Nordstrom black hole. The reason for this failure is related to a feature\nwhich was mentioned earlier. Spacetimes like Schwarzschild or de Sitter have only\none free parameter in the metric (like M or H \u22121 ) and hence the scaling of all other\nthermodynamic parameters is uniquely fixed by purely dimensional considerations.\nThis is the reason why combination like Ba are pure numbers in these cases. But, in\ngeneral, the area of the horizon (and hence the entropy) is determined by the location\nof the zero of the function f (r) while the temperature - determined by periodicity\nconsiderations - is determined by the value of f \u2032 (r) at the zero. For a general function,\nof course, there will be no relation between the location\u221aof the zero and the slope of\nthe function at that point. Thus, we cannot expect \u1e60/ P to have a simple form in\nthe general case.\n3.\n\nPartition function in quantum theory\n\nThe analysis given above provided expressions for S and E using Einstein's equation.\nI will now show that the same result can be obtained in quantum theory without using\nEinstein's equations, for a slightly wider class of metrics [17].\nA wider class of spacetimes, analyzed in the literature, has the form in (4) where\nf (r) vanishes at some surface r = a, say, with f \u2032 (a) \u2261 B remaining finite and dL2\u22a5\ninterpreted more generally. When dL2\u22a5 is taken as the metric on 2-sphere and r is\ninterpreted as the radial coordinate [0 \u2264 r \u2264 \u221e], equation (4) covers a variety of\nspherically symmetric spacetimes (including Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, de\nSitter etc.) with a compact horizon at r = a. [This is the case discussed earlier. I\ndo not assume that there is only one horizon; symbols like a, B... etc refer to different\nhorizons if more than one horizon is present and should be thought of as Bi , ai , ....\nwith i = 1, 2, ..... For simplicity of notation, I suppress the subscript i in what follows.]\nIf r is interpreted as one of the Cartesian coordinates x with (\u2212\u221e \u2264 x \u2264 \u221e) and\ndL2\u22a5 = dy 2 + dz 2 , f (x) = 1 + 2gx, equation (4) can describe the Rindler frame in flat\nspacetimes. Finally 0 \u2264 r \u2264 \u221e with dL2\u22a5 = r2 d\u03b82 will describe circularly symmetric\n(2 + 1) dimensional spacetimes. We shall first concentrate on compact horizons in\n(3 + 1) with r interpreted as radial coordinate, and comment on the other cases at the\nend.\nSince the metric is static, Euclidean continuation is trivially effected by t \u2192 \u03c4 = it\nand an examination of the conical singularity near r = a [where f (r) \u2248 B(r\u2212a)] shows\nthat \u03c4 should be interpreted as periodic with period \u03b2 = 4\u03c0/|B| corresponding to the\ntemperature T = |B|/4\u03c0. Let us consider any one of the horizons with the temperature\nT = |B|/4\u03c0. The class of metrics in (4) with the behaviour [f (a) = 0, f \u2032 (a) = B]\nconstitute a canonical ensemble at constant temperature since they all have the same\ntemperature T = |B|/4\u03c0 . The partition function for this ensemble is given by the\npath integral sum\nX\nZ(\u03b2) =\nexp(\u2212AE (g))\n(26)\ng\u01ebS\n\n\fClassical and quantum thermodynamics of horizons\n=\n\nX\ng\u01ebS\n\nexp \u2212\n\n1\n16\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03b2\n\nd\u03c4\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\nd3 x gE RE [f (r)]\n\n13\n!\n\nwhere I have made the Euclidean continuation of the Einstein action and imposed\nthe periodicity in \u03c4 with period \u03b2 = 4\u03c0/|B|. [For static spacetimes, there is some\nambiguity regarding the overall sign when the Euclidean continuation is performed.\nThe convention adopted here is as follows: First note that positive definite Euclidean\nmetric requires one to work with a signature (\u2212 + ++) while I am using (+ \u2212 \u2212\u2212).\nChanging the signature in a diagonal metric is equivalent to changing the signs of\ncomponents of metric tensor: gik \u2192 \u2212gik . This leads to \u0393i,kl \u2192 \u2212\u0393i,kl ; \u0393ikl \u2192\n\u0393ikl ; Rijkl \u2192 Rijkl ; Rjl \u2192 Rjl ; R \u2192 \u2212R. The Euclidean continuation is effected\nthrough it = \u03c4 in a spacetime with signature (\u2212 + ++).] The sum in (27) is restricted\nto the set S of all metrics of the form in (4) with the behaviour [f (a) = 0, f \u2032 (a) = B]\nand the Euclidean Lagrangian is a functional of f (r). No source term or cosmological\nconstant (which cannot be distinguished from certain form of source) is included since\nthe idea is to obtain a result which depends purely on the geometry. The spatial\nintegration will be restricted to a region bounded by the 2-spheres r = a and r = b,\nwhere the choice of b is arbitrary except for the requirement that within the region of\nintegration the Lorentzian metric must have the proper signature with t being a time\ncoordinate. Using the result\n2 d\n1 d\n[r(1 \u2212 f )]\n(27)\nR = 2 (r2 f \u2032 ) \u2212 2\nr dr\nr dr\nvalid for metrics of the form in (4) [with signature (+ - - -)], a straight forward\ncalculation shows that\nZ\n\u0003\n\u03b2 b \u0002\n\u2212 AE =\ndr \u2212[r2 f \u2032 ]\u2032 + 2[r(1 \u2212 f )]\u2032\n4 a\n\u03b2 2\n(28)\n= [a B \u2212 2a] + Q[f (b), f \u2032 (b)]\n4\nwhere Q depends on the behaviour of the metric near r = b and we have used the\nconditions [f (a) = 0, f \u2032 (a) = B]. The sum in (27) now reduces to summing over the\nvalues of [f (b), f \u2032 (b)] with a suitable (but unknown) measure. This sum, however, will\nonly lead to a factor which we can ignore in deciding about the dependence of Z(\u03b2)\non the form of the metric near r = a. Using \u03b2 = 4\u03c0/B (and taking B > 0, for the\nmoment) the final result can be written in a very suggestive form:\n\u0015\n\u0014\na\n1\n(29)\nZ(\u03b2) = Z0 exp (4\u03c0a2 ) \u2212 \u03b2( ) \u221d exp [S(a) \u2212 \u03b2E(a)]\n4\n2\nwith the identifications for the entropy and energy being given by:\n\u00131/2\n\u0012\n1\n1\n1\nAhorizon\n2\n(30)\nS = (4\u03c0a ) = Ahorizon ; E = a =\n4\n4\n2\n16\u03c0\nThis is exactly the result obtained earlier except that we have not used the\nEinstein's equations. Instead, the partition function was evaluated with two very\nnatural conditions: f (a) = 0 making the surface r = a a compact horizon and\nf \u2032 (a) = constant which is the proper characterization of the canonical ensemble of\nspacetime metrics. Since temperature is well defined for the class of metrics which\nI have considered, this canonical ensemble is defined without any ambiguity. This\nallows me to sum over a class of spherically symmetric spacetimes at one go rather\nthan deal with, say, black hole spacetimes and de Sitter spacetime separately.\n\n\fClassical and quantum thermodynamics of horizons\n\n14\n\nThe idea of using a canonical ensemble is not new and one of the earliest attempts\nis by [15]; similar ideas have been explored by different people [16] mostly in the context\nof BH spacetime. What is new are the following\nfeatures: (a) I have not added any\n\u221a\nboundary terms to the action and in fact R \u2212g in (27) is a total derivative. A detailed\ndescription of action functionals are given in Appendix B showing that the same result\nis obtained from the surface terms, if done correctly. (b) I have not invoked WKB\nlimit to evaluate the action using a solution to Einstein's equations. Normally, the\npath integral in (27) is formidable to calculate and is ill defined without the boundary\nterms. I can manage with (a) and (b) above only because I confine the sum to metrics\nin the set S. Conceptually, a canonical ensemble for a minisuperspace of metrics of\nthe form in (4) should be constructed by keeping the temperature constant without\nassuming the metrics to be the solutions of Einstein's equation; this is what I do and\nexploit the form of R given by (27). Since this action involves second derivatives, it is\nnot only allowed but even required to fix both f and f \u2032 at the boundaries. Moreover,\nsince I am summing over an arbitrary class of f (r), the behaviour of the function f (r)\nat r = b is not in any way related to the parameter a or parameter B which enters\nthe analysis at the horizon. In the conventional analysis f is chosen to be a classical\nsolution and hence its value at any radius is predetermined in terms of the parameters\nof the solution (like M in the Schwarzschild metric).\nThe temperature is determined by using Euclidean periodicity condition near\nthe horizon and is related to the derivative of f by T = |f \u2032 (a)|/4\u03c0. In the\nliterature one sometimes uses the locally defined Tolman temperature Tlocal(x) =\nTR (g00 (xR )/g00 (x))1/2 where xR is some reference point. This local temperature will\ndiverge at the horizon if TR is defined as a finite quantity elsewhere. In the approach\ntaken here, all these issues are by passed by directly defining the temperature by\nexpanding f (r) in a Taylor series near the horizon and using the locally defined Rindler\ntemperature. It is important that one uses this quantity because there is no well\ndefined notion of temperature in spacetimes with multiple horizons (see Appendix A).\nWe get the same result as as obtained earlier in the case of horizons with B < 0\nlike the de Sitter universe as well. In this case, f (r) = (1\u2212H 2 r2 ), a = H \u22121 , B = \u22122H.\nSince the region where t is time like is \"inside\" the horizon, the integral for AE in (28)\nshould be taken from some arbitrary value r = b (which could even be the origin) to\nthe horizon at r = a with a > b. So the horizon contributes in the upper limit of the\nintegral introducing a change of sign in (28). Further, since B < 0, there is another\nnegative sign in the area term from \u03b2B \u221d B/|B|. Taking all these into account we\nget, in this case,\n\u0015\n\u0014\na\n1\n2\n(31)\nZ(\u03b2) = Z0 exp (4\u03c0a ) + \u03b2( ) \u221d exp [S(a) \u2212 \u03b2E(a)]\n4\n2\ngiving S = (1/4)(4\u03c0a2 ) = (1/4)Ahorizon and E = \u2212(1/2)H \u22121 as before.\nLet us next consider the (1+2) dimensional spacetime. In D = (1 + 2), metrics\nof the type in (4) with dL2\u22a5 = r2 d\u03b82 will have the scalar curvature\n1 d\nf\u2032\nR=\n(rf \u2032 ) +\n(32)\nr dr\nr\nThe action will now become\nZ b\nB\n1\n\u2212 AE =\n(33)\n2\u03c0dr[\u2212(rf \u2032 )\u2032 \u2212 f \u2032 ] = (2\u03c0a) + Q[f \u2032 (b)]\n16\u03c0 a\n4\nleading to Z = Z0 exp[(1/4)A2D ] where the \"area\" of the 2D horizon is 2\u03c0a. This will\ngive S = (1/4)(2\u03c0a) = (1/4)Ahorizon with E = 0. The vanishing of energy signifies\n\n\fClassical and quantum thermodynamics of horizons\n\n15\n\nthe fact that at the level of the metric, Einstein's equations are vacuous in (1+2) and\nwe have not incorporated any topological effects [like deficit angles corresponding to\npoint masses in (1+2) dimensions] in our approach.\nInterestingly enough, this formalism can also handle spacetimes like Rindler unlike\nthe approach discussed in the last section which could only work for compact transverse\nareas. For the spacetimes with planar symmetry for which (4) is still applicable with\nr = x being a Cartesian coordinate and dL2\u22a5 = dy 2 + dz 2 . In this case R = f \u2032\u2032 (x) and\nthe action becomes\nZ \u03b2 Z\nZ a\n1\n\u2212 AE =\nd\u03c4 dydz\ndxf \u2032\u2032 (x)\n16\u03c0 0\nb\n\u03b2\n\u2032\n\u2032\n=\nA\u22a5 f (a) + Q[f (b)]\n(34)\n16\u03c0\nwhere we have confined the transverse integrations to a surface of area A\u22a5 . If we now\nsum over all the metrics with f (a) = 0, f \u2032 (a) = B and f \u2032 (b) arbitrary, the partition\nfunction will become\n1\n(35)\nZ(\u03b2) = Z0 exp( A\u22a5 )\n4\nwhich shows that planar horizons have an entropy of (1/4) per unit transverse area\nbut zero energy. This includes Rindler frame as a special case. Note that if we freeze\nf to its Rindler form f = 1 + 2gx, (by demanding the validity of Einstein's equations\nin the WKB approach, say) then R = f \u2032\u2032 = 0 as it should. In the action in (34),\nf \u2032 (a) \u2212 f \u2032 (b) will give zero. It is only because I am not doing a WKB analysis - but\nvarying f \u2032 (b) with fixed f \u2032 (a) - that I obtain an entropy for these spacetimes.\nIt is interesting that this approach, which does not use classical Einstein's\nequation, gives the same result as the one obtained earlier using Einstein's equation.\nOne difference is that the partition function allows us to identify S and E without\nrecourse to P or V while the in the earlier approach we essentially rewrote Einstein's\nequation as first law of thermodynamics (which included the P dV term) by multiplying\nby da. The fact that the approach based on the action functional leads to\nthe thermodynamic interpretation directly [without the use of Einstein's equation]\nsuggests that there could be a deep connection between the form of the Einstein action\nand the thermodynamic interpretation of spacetimes with horizons. This is indeed\ntrue and some aspects of this connection is explored in detail elsewhere [5] [17]. In\nparticular, it was shown in [5] that the Einstein-Hilbert action can be expressed as the\n\"free energy of spacetime\" and Einstein's equations may be interpreted as describing\nthe thermodynamics of spacetime while quantum gravity is needed to describe the\nstatistical mechanics of the microscopic degrees of freedom making up the spacetime.\nBoth the classical and quantum descriptions developed here used spherical\nsymmetry; in the first approach, we used Einstein's equations for the spherically\nsymmetric spacetime while in the second approach we used the form of R valid\nfor spherically symmetric spacetimes. One may wonder whether this assumption is\nessential or not. Given the broader interpretation of Einstein-Hilbert action as a free\nenergy of spacetime, it seems likely that one will be able to generalise the results of\nthis paper to any horizon without having to assume spherical or planar symmetry.\nThis issue is under investigation.\nI thank Apoorva Patel, S.Shankaranarayanan and Suneeta Varadarajan for useful\ncomments.\n\n\fClassical and quantum thermodynamics of horizons\n\n16\n\nAppendix A. Spacetimes with multiple horizons\nMetrics in the form in (4) with f (r) having a simple zero at one or more points,\nr = ai , i = 1, 2, 3, ..., exhibit coordinate singularities at r = ai . The coordinate t\nalternates between being time like and space like when each of these horizons are\ncrossed. Since all curvature invariants are well behaved at the horizons, it will be\npossible to introduce coordinate patches such that the metric is also well behaved at\nthe horizon. There is a general procedure for doing this in the case of spacetimes with\na single horizon, which can be used to handle multi horizon spacetimes as well.\nConcentrating on the (t, r) plane, we first introduce the tortoise coordinate \u03be so\nthat the metric becomes\nZ\ndr2\ndr\n2\n2\n2\n2\nds = f (r)dt \u2212\n= f (\u03be)(dt \u2212 d\u03be ); \u03be =\n(A.1)\nf (r)\nf (r)\n\nSwitching over to the light cone coordinates (u, v) by\nu = t \u2212 \u03be;\n\nv =t+\u03be\n\n(A.2)\n\nthe metric becomes\n\n1\nds2 = f (\u03be)(dt2 \u2212 d\u03be 2 ) = f [ (v \u2212 u)]dudv\n(A.3)\n2\nThe coordinate systems (t, \u03be), (u, v) are still singular near the horizons r \u2248 ai .\nAssuming f (r) \u2248 Bi (r \u2212 ai ) near r = ai [with Bi = f \u2032 (ai )], it is easy to see that\nnear the horizon the line element has the form\nds2 \u2248 Bi ai e(Bi /2)(v\u2212u) dvdu\n\n(A.4)\n\nwhich is badly behaved because (v \u2212 u) \u221d \u03be has a logarithmic singularity near r = ai .\nHowever, the form of the metric in (A.4) suggests a natural coordinate transformation\nfrom (u, v) to a non singular coordinate system (U, V ) with\nVi = (2/Bi ) exp[(Bi /2)v];\n2\n\nUi = \u2212(2/Bi ) exp[(\u2212Bi /2)u]\n\u2212(4f /Bi2 Ui Vi )\n\n(A.5)\n\nin terms of which the metric becomes ds =\ndUi dVi . By construction,\nthe (Ui , Vi ) coordinate system is regular on the horizon at r = ai , since the combination\n(f /Ui Vi ) is finite on the horizon. The transformation (A.5) will lead to the familiar\nKruskal type coordinate system in all cases with a single horizon like the Schwarzschild,\nReissner Nordstrom or de Sitter manifold. In these cases i = 1 and we need only one\ncoordinate patch with (U, V ) to cover the manifold.\nWhen there is more than one horizon, we need to introduce one Kruskal like\ncoordinate patch for each of the horizons; the (u, v) coordinate system is unique in the\nmanifold but the (Ui , Vi ) coordinate systems are different for each of the horizons since\nthe transformation in (A.5) depends explicitly on Bi 's which are (in general) different\nfor each of the horizons. In such a case, there will be regions of the manifold in which\nmore than one Kruskal like patch can be introduced. The compatibility between these\ncoordinates can provide interesting constraints.\nIt is easy to develop the quantum field theory in the t \u2212 r plane if we treat it\nas a (1 + 1) dimensional spacetime. In this case, the solutions to the wave equations\nare just arbitrary functions of the null coordinates in a conformally flat coordinate\nsystem. Since (u, v) as well as all the (Ui , Vi ) coordinates retain the conformally\nflat nature of the (1 + 1) dimension, we can define suitable mode functions and\nvacuum state in a straightforward manner. The outgoing and ingoing modes of\nthe kind (4\u03c0\u03c9)\u22121/2 [exp(\u2212i\u03c9u), exp(\u2212i\u03c9v)] defines a static vacuum state. This is\n\n\fClassical and quantum thermodynamics of horizons\n\n17\n\ncalled Boulware vacuum in the case of Schwarzschild black hole, but it can be defined\nin a general spacetime of the kind we are studying (see reference [4]). The modes\nof the kind (4\u03c0\u03c9)\u22121/2 [exp(\u2212i\u03c9Ui ), exp(\u2212i\u03c9Vi )] define another vacuum state called\nHartle-Hawking vacuum in the case of Schwarzschild black hole. (The modes of the\nkind (4\u03c0\u03c9)\u22121/2 [exp(\u2212i\u03c9U ), exp(\u2212i\u03c9v)] define the analogue of Unruh vacuum which,\nhowever, we will not need.) The transformations between the Boulware and HartleHawking modes are identical to those in the case of Schwarzschild black hole with the\nsurface gravity at the corresponding horizon occurring in the transformations. The\nstudy of either Bogoliubov coefficients or the stress-tensor expectation values will now\nshow that the Hartle-Hawking vacuum has an equilibrium temperature Ti = |Bi |/4\u03c0.\nThe Bogoliubov coefficients between two different Hartle-Hawking modes, of course,\nhave no simple interpretation, showing that there is a conceptual problem in defining\na unique temperature in the overlapping region.\nThis difficulty is apparent even from an examination of the coordinate\ntransformations. Consider, for example, the region between two consecutive horizons\nrn < r < rn+1 in which t is time like. The coordinates (Ui , Vi ) with i = n, n + 1\noverlaps in this region. Euclideanisation of the metric can be easily effected in the\nregion rn < r < rn+1 by taking \u03c4 = it. This will lead to the transformations\nUn+1 = \u2212Un exp[(Bn+1 + Bn )((\u2212i\u03c4 \u2212 \u03be)/2)];\n\nVn+1 = \u2212Vn exp[\u2212(Bn+1 + Bn )((\u2212i\u03c4 + \u03be)/2)]\n\n(A.6)\n\nObviously, single valuedness can be maintained only if the period of \u03c4 is an integer\nmultiple of 4\u03c0/(Bn+1 + Bn ). More importantly, we get from (A.5) the relation\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nBi \u03c4\nBi \u03be\n4\nsinh \u2212i\n(A.7)\nexp\nUi + Vi =\nBi\n2\n2\nwhich shows that (Ui , Vi ) can be used to define values of \u03c4 only up to integer multiples\nof 4\u03c0/Bi in each patch. But since (Un , Vn ) and (Un+1 , Vn+1 ) are to be well defined\ncoordinates in the overlap, the periodicity \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 +\u03b2 which leaves both the sets (Un , Vn )\nand (Un+1 , Vn+1 ) invariant must be such that \u03b2 is an integer multiple of both 4\u03c0/Bn\nand 4\u03c0/Bn+1 . This will require \u03b2 = 4\u03c0ni /Bi for all i with ni being a set of integers.\nThis, in turn, implies that Bi /Bj = ni /nj making the ratio between any two surface\ngravities a rational number. Since there is no physical basis for such a condition, it\nseems reasonable to conclude that these difficulties arise because of our demanding\nthe existence of a finite periodicity \u03b2 in the Euclidean time coordinate. This demand\nis related to an expectation of thermal equilibrium which is violated in spacetimes\nwith multiple horizons having different temperatures. Hence, such spacetimes will not\nhave a global notion of temperature, entropy etc. It seems, however, unlikely that we\ncannot attribute a temperature to a black hole formed in some region of the universe\njust because the universe at the largest scales is described by a de Sitter spacetime,\nsay. One is led to searching for a local description of the dynamics of all horizons.\nAppendix B. The choice of action functional\nAction functionals in classical theory are essentially tools to obtain equations of motion\nand provide a book keeping of the symmetries of the theory. The numerical value of\nthe action does not play a significant role in classical theory. The situation is different\nin quantum theory in which the actual value of the action may be of relevance in\nevaluating a path integral or in interpreting a partition function.\n\n\fClassical and quantum thermodynamics of horizons\n\n18\n\nIn the case of general relativity, the generally covariant action is the EinsteinHilbert action AEH given by\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nR \u2212gd4 x\nAEH \u2261\n(B.1)\n16\u03c0\n\u221a\nSince R \u2212g is linear in second derivatives of the metric tensor, it is possible to write\nthis action in the form\nZ\nZ\n\u221a\n1\n1\n4\nLSD \u2212gd x \u2212\n\u2202c P c d4 x\nAEH =\n16\u03c0\n16\u03c0\nZ\n1\n\u2202c P c d4 x\n(B.2)\n\u2261 ASD \u2212\n16\u03c0\nwhere\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(B.3)\nLSD = g ab \u0393ija \u0393jib \u2212 \u0393iab \u0393jij\nPc =\n\n\u221a\n\n\u0001\n\u221a\ncb \u221a\nik c\n\u2212g g ck \u0393m\n\u2212g\u2202b g bc\nkm \u2212 g \u0393ik = 2g \u2202b \u2212g +\n\n(B.4)\n\nEquation (B.2) defines the Schroedinger-Dirac action ASD which is quadratic in the\nChristoffel symbols and does not contain second derivatives of the metric tensor.\nIt is possible to write the second term in (B.2) in a different manner which is\noften used in the literature. If we foliate the spacetime by a series of spacelike hypersurfaces S with ni as normal, then g ik = hik + ni nk where hik is the induced metric\non S. It is conventional to define a quantity called extrinsic curvature Kab such that\nb\n\nc\n\nKab = \u2207a nb + na ab\n\n(B.5)\n\nb\n\nwhere a \u2261 n \u2207c n is the \"acceleration\" corresponding to trajectories with \"four\nvelocity\" na . (This makes sense on the x0 = constant space-like surfaces since the\nunit normal na to such surfaces can be thought of as the four velocities tangential to\nx = constant curves. On the surfaces like x1 = constant, say, the normal will not be\ntime like and ab should be just treated as a vector normal to nb and tangential to the\nsurface element. It does not correspond to a physical acceleration.) In all the surfaces,\nnb ab = 0 allowing us to write K = \u2207a na . Given the covariant derivative \u2207i nj of the\nnormals to S, one can construct only three vectors (nj \u2207j ni , nj \u2207i nj , ni \u2207j nj ) which are\nlinear in covariant derivative operator. The first one is the acceleration ai = nj \u2207j ni ;\nthe second identically vanishes since nj has unit norm; the third, ui K, is proportional\nto the trace of the extrinsic curvature K = \u2207j nj of S. Hence, the the second term in\n(B.2) - which is linear in the derivatives of the Christoffel symbols - must be the\nfour divergence of a linear combination of ui K and ai . So the corresponding term in\nthe action must have the form\nZ\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u221a\n(B.6)\nAsurface = d4 x \u2212g\u2207i \u03bb1 Kui + \u03bb2 ai\nwhere \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 are numerical constants. This final result - though probably not\nthe reasoning given above - is known in the conventional (3 + 1) formalism (see e.g.,\nequation (21.88) of [7]). Since ui ai = 0, the spacelike boundaries at x0 = constant\ngets contribution only from K while the time like surfaces like x1 = constant gets\ncontribution from the normal component of the acceleration ai n\u0302i where n\u0302i is the\nnormal to the time like surface. The numerical constants can be easily evaluated by\nchoosing some simple metric, thereby fixing the surface term.\n\n\fClassical and quantum thermodynamics of horizons\n\n19\n\nSuch a detailed analysis shows that the surface integral can actually be written\nas\n1\n16\u03c0\n\nX 1 Z\n\u221a\n\u2202c P d x =\nd3 x h K\n8\u03c0 \u2202V\nV\n\nZ\n\nc 4\n\nIt is therefore possible to define the ASD by either of the relations\nZ\n1\n\u2202c P c d4 x\nASD = AEH +\n16\u03c0\nX 1 Z\n\u221a\n\u2261 AEH +\nd3 x h K\n8\u03c0 \u2202V\n\n(B.7)\n\n(B.8)\n\nThe following points need to be noted regarding this result: (a) From the origin of\nthis equation we know that neither the left hand side nor the second term in the right\nhand side is generally covariant. (b) The action AEH vanishes in flat spacetime. The\naction ASD does not, in general, vanish in flat spacetime if non Cartesian coordinates\nare used. (c) The numerical values of all these actions can be formally divergent if\nintegration domain is unbounded either in space or time. In the case of ASD this can\nhappen even in flat spacetime if curvilinear coordinates are used.\nThe action AEH vanishes for any vacuum solution of Einstein's equation and in\nparticular for the Schwarzschild metric. If one insists on using WKB value of action\nto interpret spacetime thermodynamics, then AEH will not help even in the simplest\ncase of Schwarzschild black hole. Motivated by this, most of the previous workers in\nthis field [16] have used ASD in order to obtain a non zero value for the action for\nthe Schwarzschild black hole. In fact, it is often done by using the second expression\n(involving the surface integral). While this is done fairly routinely in the literature, it\nis easy to go wrong unless some caution is exercised, especially in deciding which are\nthe surfaces over which one must do the summation.\nTo illustrate this, I shall consider evaluation of the action for the class of metrics\nstudied in this paper - which have been repeatedly analyzed in the literature, though\nwrongly at times. The line element is\nds2 = f (r)dt2 \u2212 f (r)\u22121 dr2 \u2212 r2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 )\n\n(B.9)\n\nI choose the four dimensional region V to be bounded by two spacelike surfaces ( S0 , S\u03b2 )\nat t = 0, t = \u03b2 and two time like surfaces (Ra , Rb ) at r = a, r = b. Since the metric\nis static, the time derivative in \u2202c P c does not contribute (or, rather the contributions\nfrom S0 and S\u03b2 cancel each other). We thus only need to do the integral over Ra , Rb\nand - in these integrals - the integration over time reduces to multiplication by \u03b2.\nThus\nZ\nZ\n1\n\u03b2\n\u2202c P c d4 x =\n\u2202\u03b1 P \u03b1 d3 x;\n(\u03b1 = 1, 2, 3)\n(B.10)\n16\u03c0 V\n16\u03c0\nIf we convert this into a surface integral of the radial component P r over the bounding\nsurfaces Ra , Rb , then we will get\nZ\nZ\n\u03b2\n1\n4\nc\nd x \u2202c P =\nd3 x \u2202\u03b1 P \u03b1\n16\u03c0 V\n16\u03c0\nZ \u03b8=\u03c0 Z 2\u03c0\nb\n\u03b2\n=\nd\u03c6 P r\nd\u03b8\n(B.11)\n16\u03c0 \u03b8=0\n0\na\n\n\fClassical and quantum thermodynamics of horizons\n\n20\n\nwhere the vertical line denotes that the integral should be evaluated at r = b and\nr = a and the latter should be subtracted from the former.

The term in the right hand side will contribute \u22124\u03c0M 2 =\n\u2212(1/4)(Horizon Area) when evaluated on the horizon r = 2M and is often related to\nthe entropy.\nIn spite of the simplicity of the calculation, this result is algebraically wrong.\nProving it wrong is quite trivial and can be done by computing (B.7) by evaluating\nthe left hand side directly.

This will lead to the result quoted above.\nBut there is a contribution from the second term! Since\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2\nP \u03b8 = 2g \u03b8\u03b8 \u2202\u03b8 \u2212g + \u2212g\u2202\u03b8 g \u03b8\u03b8 = \u2212 2 r2 cos \u03b8 = \u22122 cos \u03b8\n(B.19)\nr\n\n\fClassical and quantum thermodynamics of horizons\nthe second term gives\nZ \u03b2 Z 2\u03c0\nZ b Z \u03c0\n\u2202P \u03b8\n1\ndt\nd\u03c6\ndr\nd\u03b8\n16\u03c0 0\n\u2202\u03b8\n0\na\n0\nZ b\n\u0002\n\u0003 \u03b2\n\u03b2\n\u03b2r\n=\ndr P \u03b8 (\u03b8 = \u03c0) \u2212 P 0 (\u03b8 = 0) = (b \u2212 a) =\n8 a\n2\n2\n\n21\n\nb\n\n(B.20)\na\n\nAdding the two contributions together, we get the correct result to be\nZ\n\u0003b\n1\n1 \u0002\n\u2202c P c d4 x = \u03b2 \u2212r2 f \u2032 + 2r(1 \u2212 2f ) a\n16\u03c0\n4\n\n(B.21)\n\nWhen evaluated on the Schwarzschild horizon (with \u03b2 = 8\u03c0M being the inverse\ntemperature related to the periodicity in Euclidean time) the extra term (\u03b2r/2) gives\na contribution \u03b2M = 8\u03c0M 2 which, when added to the original contribution (\u22124\u03c0M 2 )\nfrom the P r , leads to a net contribution of (+4\u03c0M 2 ). Thus the difference between\nthe correct and wrong results in the case of Schwarzschild metric is just a flip of sign.\nIt is easy to miss this or \"reinterpret\" it, given the fact that one usually works in\nEuclidean sector.\nUnfortunately, this misses the correct interpretation.\nFor Schwarzschild\nspacetime, the entropy and temperature are given by S = 4\u03c0M 2 , T = \u03b2 \u22121 = 8\u03c0M ; so\nthe combination \u03b2F \u2261 S \u2212 \u03b2E where F is the free energy, is given by\nS \u2212 \u03b2E = 4\u03c0M 2 \u2212 (8\u03c0M )M = \u22124\u03c0M 2 = \u2212S\n\n(B.22)\n\nThe sign flip, arising due to the extra term makes all the difference between entropy\nS and the free energy S \u2212 \u03b2E.\nTo see this more clearly, let us consider a situation in which f (r) has a simple\nzero at r = rH with a finite derivative |f \u2032 (rH )| \u2261 B, say. This will lead to a compact\nhorizon at r = rH . Periodicity in the Euclidean time will now require \u03b2B = 4\u03c0. The\nwrong expressions (B.13,B.16) will give, on the horizon (where f = 0)\n1 2\n1\n1 2\n2\n\u03b2f \u2032 (rH ) = \u2212 rH\n\u03b2B = \u2212\u03c0rH\n= \u2212 (HorizonArea)\nIwrong = \u2212 rH\n4\n4\n4\n= \u2212S\n(B.23)\nBut the correct result (B.21) gives\n1 2\n1 2\n\u03b2f \u2032 (rH ) + \u03b2(rH /2) = \u2212 rH\n\u03b2B + \u03b2(rH /2)\nIcorrect = \u2212 rH\n4\n4\n2\n= \u2212 \u03c0rH\n+ \u03b2(rH /2) = \u2212(S \u2212 \u03b2E)\n\n(B.24)\n\nwith the energy associated with any horizon being given by E = (rH /2). It is this\ninterpretation and the possibility of defining the energy for any horizon which is missed\nwhen the wrong result is used.\nBut how can a rigorously proved equation (B.7) go wrong ? Actually, it did not.\nIn the summation on the right hand side of (B.7), one also need to sum over a strange\nsurface \u03b8 =constant to get the correct result. To see this, note that the correct unit\nnormal to the \u03b8 =constant surface is\n1\nn\u03b8 = p\n(0, 0, 1, 0) = r(0, 0, 1, 0);\n|g \u03b8\u03b8 |\n1\n(B.25)\nn\u03b8 = g \u03b8\u03b8 n\u03b8 = \u2212 (0, 0, 1, 0)\nr\n\n\fClassical and quantum thermodynamics of horizons\n\n22\n\nThe trace of the extrinsic curvature of this surface is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221a\n1\n1\n1\na\na\n2\nK = \u2207a n = \u221a \u2202a ( \u2212gn ) = \u2212 2\n\u2202\u03b8 r sin \u03b8\n\u2212g\nr sin \u03b8\nr\n1\n(B.26)\n= \u2212 cot \u03b8\nr\nOn a \u03b8 =constant surface, the integral on the right hand side of (B.8) will give\n\u0015\n\u0015\u0014\nZ\nZ 2\u03c0\nZ b \u0014p\n\u221a\n1\n\u03b2\n1\ncot \u03b8\n3\nf \u221a r sin \u03b8\nd x hK = \u2212\nd\u03c6\ndr\n8\u03c0 \u03b8=const\n8\u03c0 0\nr\nf\na\n\u03b2\n= \u2212 (b \u2212 a) cos \u03b8\n(B.27)\n4\nWhen we evaluate this contribution at the surfaces \u03b8 = \u03c0 and \u03b8 = 0 and subtract one\nfrom the other, we get\nZ\n\u221a\n\u03b2\n1\n(b \u2212 a)\n(B.28)\nd3 x hK|\u03b8=\u03c0\n\u03b8=0 =\n8\u03c0\n2\nwhich is precisely the piece which was originally missing in action.\nThe reason for this \"trouble\" is that there are situations with integrable\nsingularities for which Gauss theorem is not applicable (or will give the wrong result)\neven in the ordinary 3-dimensional flat space, in standard spherical polar coordinates.\nConsider a vector field with components\nv r = A(r) sin \u03b8,\n\nv \u03b8 = \u2212 cos \u03b8,\n\nv\u03c6 = 0\n\n(B.29)\n\n\u03b1\n\nwith A(r = 0) = 0. We want to integrate the quantity \u2202\u03b1 v over the 3 dimensional\nball (B) of radius R.

We will now do it in\na different way. Let us define another vector field u\u03b1 through the relation\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u221a\n1\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(B.32)\nd3 x (\u2202\u03b1 v \u03b1 ) = ( gd3 x) \u221a \u2202\u03b1 ( gu\u03b1 ) = ( gd3 x)\u2207 * u\ng\nThe components of the new vector are given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\nv\u03b1\n1\nA(r)\nu\u03b1 = \u221a =\n,\n\u2212\ncot\n\u03b8,\n0\ng\nr2\nr2\n\n(B.33)\n\nThe integral of \u2202\u03b1 v \u03b1 over d3 x \u2261 drd\u03b8d\u03c6 is the same as the integral of the covariant\n\u221a\ndivergence \u2207 * u over the volume element gd3 x.

The second term\n4\u03c0R of (B.31) is missing; the original analysis clearly shows that it originated from\n\n\fClassical and quantum thermodynamics of horizons\n\n23\n\n(\u2202v \u03b8 /\u2202\u03b8) which we miss unless we deal with \u03b8 = constant \"surfaces\". How can an old\nfaithful like Gauss theorem lead us astray ? Before applying Gauss theorem to the\nvector field u in (B.34) we need to ensure that the vector field is not singular. Equation\n(B.33) clearly shows that the u\u03b8 component diverges on the z\u2212axis corresponding to\n\u03b8 = (0, \u03c0). There is a singularity on this axis which gives the extra contribution.\nIn summary, we get the correct interpretation of the action as the free energy of\nhorizon, when the surface terms are taken into account correctly.\nReferences\n[1] For a review of early results, see the articles in DeWitt C. and DeWitt B.S.
