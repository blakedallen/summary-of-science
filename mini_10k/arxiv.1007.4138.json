K. Bentkus\n1. Introduction\nWe will assume that the reader is familiar with the work of Mathieu Dupont on abelian 2categories [14] (called 2-abelian Gpd-category in [14]). We do not recall this quite technical\ndefinition and give only general remarks and few examples.\nThe main difference between abelian categories and abelian 2-categories is that in abelian\n2-categories we have not only objects and morphisms but we have also 2-cells or tracks\nbetween two parallel arrows. To be more precise abelian 2-categories are first of all groupoid\nenrich categories.\nRecall that a groupoid is a small category such that all morphisms are isomorphisms.\nFor a groupoid G and an object x \u2208 G we let \u03c00 (G) and \u03c01 (G, x) be the set of connected\ncomponents of G and the group of automorphisms of x in G respectively.\nThe prototype of abelian categories is the category of abelian groups Ab. A similar role\nin the two dimensional world is plaid by the 2-category SCG of symmetric categorical\ngroups. The notion of a symmetric categorical group is a categorification of a notion of\nabelian group. More precisely, let (A, +, 0, a, l, r, c) be a symmetric monoidal category,\nwhere + : A \u00d7 A \u2192 A is the composition law, 0 is the neutral element, a is the associative\nconstrants, c is the commutativity constrants and l : Id \u2192 0 + Id and r : Id \u2192 Id + 0\nare natural transformations satisfying well-known properties [23]. We will say that A is a\nsymmetric categorical group or Picard category provided A is a groupoid and for any object\nx the endofunctor x+ : A \u2192 A is an equivalence of categories. It follows that \u03c00 (G) is an\nabelian group and the endofunctor x+ : A \u2192 A yields an isomorphism \u03c01 (G, 0) \u2192 \u03c01 (G, x)\nof abelian groups. In what follows we will write \u03c01 (G) instead of \u03c01 (G, 0).\nSymmetric categorical groups form the 2-category SCG which is the prototype for\nabelian 2-categories. In an abelian 2-category T for any two object A and B the hom\ngroupoid HomT (A, B) is in fact a symmetric categorical group. Moreover T has kernels\nand cokernels in the 2-dimensional sense and satisfies exactness properties.\nFor any object A of an abelian 2-category T, the composition of morphisms equips\nthe symmetric categorical group Hom(A, A) with a multiplication. This two structure\nform a mathematical object called 2-ring. Here a 2-ring (called also Ann-category [28],\nor categorical ring [20]) is a categorification of the version of a ring and it consists of a\nsymmetric categorical group equipped with \"multiplication\" satisfying Laplaza coherent\nResearch was partially supported by the GNSF Grant ST08/3-387.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nT. PIRASHVILI\n\naxioms [22]. This notion with different name already presents in the pioneering work of\nTakeuchi [32].\nLarge class of examples of abelian 2-categories are given by the 2-categories of 2-modules\nover 2-rings [14], [30], [18].\nAny category can be considered as a groupoid enrich category with trivial tracks. Hence\nthe theory of groupoid enrich categories generalizes usual category theory. In a sense the\ntheory of abelian 2-categories also generalizes the theory of abelian categories, but in a\nmore tricky way. Let A be an abelian category, we wish to associate to it an abelian\n2-category. The first idea which comes in mind is to consider A as a groupoid enrich\ncategory with trivial tracks. However in this way we never obtain an abelian 2-category\nexcept the trivial case A = 0 [14]. More interesting is the following construction. Let A be\na\nan abelian category and consider the 2-category A[1] consisting of arrows A = (A1 \u2212\n\u2192 A0 )\nconsidered as chain complexes concentrated in dimensions 1 and 0. Then morphisms in\nA[1] are just chain maps and tracks are just chain homotopies. However A[1] is usually\nNOT an abelian 2-category, except the case when A is semi-simple [14]. To solve the\ndilemma, let us assume that A is an abelian category with enough projective objects and\na\n[1]\nconsider the full 2-subcategory Ac consisting of arrows A = (A1 \u2212\n\u2192 A0 ) with projective\n[1]\nA0 . Then Ac is an abelian 2-category [25] and this is a way how abelian categories should\nbe considered as a part of the theory of abelian 2-categories. To support this point of view\nlet us observe that any abelian 2-category T defines the derived category D(T), which is\ntriangulated category in the usual sense [35]. It is easy to observe that the derived category\n[1]\nof Ac triangulated equivalent to the classical derived category D(A) of A.\n[1]\nIt is interesting to compare A[1] and Ac from the point of view of usual category\n[1]\ntheory. The underlying category of A[1] is abelian, while the underling category of Ac\nhas no kernels nor cokernels in general. However from the point of view of 2-dimensional\n[1]\nalgebra Ac is much nicer. This is no accident and the reader familiar with homological\nand homotopical algebra recognize the role of cofibrant objects.\nOf course the dual construction works as well. Namely, if A is an abelian category with\na\n[1]\n\u2192 A0 )\nenough injective objects then the 2-category Af consisting of arrows A = (A1 \u2212\nwith injective A1 is an abelian 2-category. Assuming now that A has enough projective\n[1]\n[1]\nand injective objects. So we could perform both constructions Ac and Af and they\nlooks quite different from the point of view of the usual category theory but they are 2equivalent abelian 2-categories (actually using \"butterflies\" [2] these constructions can be\nunify and get an abelian 2-category starting from an arbitrary abelian category satisfying\nsome smallness conditions).\nIt is maybe worthwhile to say that the notion of 2-equivalence is a 2-dimensional analogue\nof the notion of equivalence of categories. The set of objects is NOT invariant under\nequivalence of categories. Similarly the underlain category of an abelian 2-category is\n[1]\n[1]\nNOT invariant under 2-equivalences as we have seen in the examples Ac and Af . Now\nwe give more examples of the same phenomena.\n\n\fON ABELIAN 2-CATEGORIES AND DERIVED 2-FUNCTORS\n\n3\n\nAssume R is a ring. The category A of left R-modules is an abelian category, so we can\n[1]\nconsider the corresponding abelian 2-category Ac . On the other hand R can be seen as a\ndiscrete 2-ring. So we have another abelian 2-category, namely the 2-category of 2-modules\nover R. These 2-categories are very different from the point of view of the usual category\ntheory but they are 2-equivalent abelian 2-categories (see Corollary 2).\nIt is well-known and is absolutely trivial that the category of abelian groups is isomorphic\nto the category of modules over the ring of integers. Probably a similar fact is also true for\nsymmetric categorical groups. The role of integers should be played by the free symmetric\ncategorical group with one generator equipped with appropriate multiplication. After my\nsuggestion Vincent Schmitt worked on this and related problems, but unfortunately his\nwork [30] in this direction is unfinished.\nHowever, if one considers the problem not up to isomorphisms but up to 2-equivalences,\nthen it can be solved quite easily. Namely, one can consider the following symmetric\ncategorical group \u03a6. Objects of \u03a6 are integers. If n 6= m then there is no morphism from\nn to m, n, m \u2208 Z. The group of automorphisms of n is the cyclic group of order two with\ngenerator \u01ebn , n \u2208 Z. The monoidal functor in \u03a6 is induced by the addition of integers.\nThe associativity and unite constrants are identity morphisms, while the commutativity\nconstrant n + m \u2192 m + n equals to nm\u01ebn+m . We will see that \u03a6 plays the same role\nin SCG as the abelian group of integers plays in the category of abelian groups in the\nfollowing sense: \u03a6 has a natural 2-ring structure induced by the multiplication of integers\n(all distributivity constrants being trivial) and the 2-category of 2-modules over \u03a6 in fact\nis 2-equivalent to the 2-category SCG (see Proposition 13).\nThese facts can be easily deduced from two theorems proved below. The first one is a\n2-dimensional analogue of the Gabriel-Mitchel theorem (see Theorem 1 below) while the\nsecond theorem claim that abelian 2-category SCG (as well as the abelian 2-category of\n2-modules over a 2-ring) has enough projective objects. In fact it has also enough injective\nobjects. The result on projective and injective objects first was proved in [26] and this\nworks should be considered as an extended version of it. We also added small sections on\nresolutions and derived 2-functors, following to [6], [7] and [13]. In particular we develop the\ntheory of secondary ext objects in abelian 2-categories and we show that the cohomology\nof 2-groups can be described via such ext.\n2. Gabriel-Mitchel theorem\nWe start with some definitions. Following to [14] an additive 2-functor from an abelian\n2-category T to another abelian 2-category T1 is a pseudo-functor which on hom-s is a morphism of symmetric monoidal categories. A 2-functor F : T \u2192 T\u2032 is called a 2-equivalence\nbetween abelian 2-categories if the functors T(A, A\u2032 ) \u2192 T\u2032 (F A, F A\u2032) are equivalences of\ngroupoids for all objects A, A\u2032 of T and each object B of T\u2032 is equivalent to some object of\nthe form F (A). If T is an abelian 2-category, we let Ho(T) be the category which has the\nsame objects as T, while for objects A and B we have homHo(T) (A, B) = \u03c00 HomT (A, B).\nThis category is known as the homotopy category of T. A morphism f : A \u2192 B in\nan abelian 2-category T is called faithful provided for all object X the induced functor\n\n\f4\n\nT. PIRASHVILI\n\nf X : T(X, A) \u2192 T(X, B) is faithful. An object A in an abelian 2-category T is called\ninjective provided for any faithful morphism F : S1 \u2192 S2 the induced map\nhomHo(T) (S2 , A) \u2192 homHo(T) (S1 , A)\nis surjective. We will say that an abelian 2-category T has enough injective objects provided\nfor any object A there exist a faithful morphism A \u2192 S with injective object S.\nDually, a morphism f : A \u2192 B in an abelian 2-category T is called cofaithful provided\nfor all object X the induced functor fX : T(A, X) \u2192 T(B, X) is faithful. An object A is\ncalled projective provided for any cofaithful morphism F : S1 \u2192 S2 the induced map\nhomHo(T) (A, S1 ) \u2192 homHo(T) (A, S2 )\nis surjective. We will say that an abelian 2-category T has enough projective objects\nprovided for any object A there exist a cofaithful morphism S \u2192 A with projective object\nS.\nA coproduct\nof the family Ai , i \u2208 I of objects in an abelian 2-category T is an object\nL\nA = i\u2208I Ai equipped with maps \u03bci : Ai \u2192 A, i \u2208 I such that for any object X \u2208 T the\ninduced morphism\nY\n\u03bc\u2217 : HomT (A, X) \u2192\nHomT (Ai , X)\ni\u2208I\n\nis an equivalence of groupoids. In this case A is coproduct of the family Ai , i \u2208 I in the\ncategory Ho(T) as well. By duality we can also talk on products. Observe that if A1 and\nA2 are objects in an abelian 2-category T then there exist a product A = A1 \u00d7 A2 which is\nalso a coproduct. We will say that an abelian 2-category T has coproducts if for any family\nof objects Ai , i \u2208 I there exists coproduct \u2295i\u2208I Ai . Dually for products. It is obvious that\ncoproduct of projective objects is projective and product of injective objects is injective.\nIt is easy to show that the abelian 2-category SCG has all coproducts and products.\nSimilarly for the 2-category of 2-modules over 2-rings.\nWe will say that an object G is a generator of an abelian 2-category T provided for any\nobject S there is a diagram\n0\n\u03b1\nf\n\n\u001f\u001f KS \u001f\u001f\n\ng\n\n\u001b\n\n/B\n/C\nA\nsuch that the relative cokernel of this diagram is equivalent to S and objects A, B, C are\ncoproducts of G. An object S is small if HomT (S, \u2212) preserves coproducts. The reader\nfamiliar with the corresponding notion in the classical world maybe find this definition ad\nhoc. However, it is known (see for example pp. 52-53 in [3]) that an object G of an abelian\ncategory A is a generator if and only if any object of A is isomorphic to the cokernel of a\nmap G1 \u2192 G0 , where G1 , G2 are coproducts of G.\nIn an abelian 2-category T any morphism has a kernel and cokernel in the sense of 2categories. The cokernel of the morphism X \u2192 0 is denoted by \u03a3X, while the kernel of the\nmorphism 0 \u2192 X by \u03a9X. It is well-known that \u03a92 = 0 and \u03a32 = 0. Objects X is called\n\n\fON ABELIAN 2-CATEGORIES AND DERIVED 2-FUNCTORS\n\n5\n\ndiscrete (resp. codiscrete, or connected ) if \u03a9X = 0 (resp. \u03a3X = 0). The full subcategory\nof Ho(T) formed by discrete (resp. codiscrete) objects is an abelian category denoted by\nDis(T) (resp. Codis(T)). It is a remarkable fact that Dis(T) and Codis(T) are equivalent\ncategories.\nThe following is a 2-dimensional analogue of the classical Gabriel-Mitchel's theorem (p.54\nin [3]). To state it recall that if T is an additive 2-category and M is an object in T then one\nhas the 2-ring EndT (M) := HomT (M, M) (compare [14],[30]) and for any object X, the\nsymmetric categorical group Hom(M, X) is a right 2-module over h(X) = HomT (M, X).\nIn this way we get a 2-functor h from T to the 2-category of 2-modules over EndT (M).\nTheorem 1. Let T be an abelian 2-category with arbitrary coproducts. If M is a small projective generator in T then 2-functor h from T to the category of right categorical modules\nover the categorical ring R = End(M) is a 2-equivalence of abelian 2-categories.\nProof. Our argument is almost literary follows to pp. 54-55 in [3]. The fact that if R\nis a 2-ring, then R considered as a right R-module is a small projective generator is an\neasy consequence of the 2-dimensional Yoneda lemma. Assume now that T satisfies the\nconditions of the theorem. We need to establish two facts. Firstly, for any objects X, Y in\nT the functor\nhX,Y : HomT (X, Y ) \u2192 HomR (hX, hY )\nis an equivalence of categories and secondly every 2-module Z is equivalent to some h(X).\nWe start to verify the first assertion. We fix Y and consider hX,Y as a natural transformation \u03b1 : T \u2192 S, where T (X) = HomT (X, Y ) and S(X) = HomR (hX, hY ). Observe that\nif X = M then \u03b1(X) is an equivalence of categories by Yoneda and because of smallness\nassumption it is also an equivalence for X isomorphic to a coproduct of M. Since hom-s\nare left exact and HomT (M, \u2212) is an exact functor (due to projectivity of M) it follows\nthat both 2-functors T and S are left exact as well. Since M is a generator it follows that\n\u03b1(X) is an equivalence of categories for any X.\nTo see the second assertion, we use the fact that R is a generator in the 2-category of\nR-modules, hence we can write Z as a relative cokernel of a diagram\n0\n\u03b1\n\nR(I1 )\n\nf\n\n/\n\n\u001f\u001f KS \u001f\u001f\n\nR(I2 )\n\ng\n\n/\n\nR(I3 )\n\nwhere R(I) denotes the coproduct of I-copies of R. Since\nHomR ((hM)(Ii ) , ((hM)(Ij ) ) \u223c\n= HomR ((h(M (Ii ) ), (h(M (Ij ) ))\nwe see that the diagram is equivalent to one which comes from a similar diagram in T by\napplying the 2-functor h and again by exactness of h we see that Z is equivalent to one of\nthe form h(X).\n\u0003\nAs an immediate consequence of this theorem we see that in terminology [14] any 2abelian Gpd-category which posses a small projective generator and arbitrary coproducts\n\n\f6\n\nT.

Let R be a classical ring and A be the abelian category of classical R-modules.\n[1]\nThen the abelian 2-category Ac is equivalent to the 2-category of 2-modules over R considered as a discrete 2-ring.\n[1]\n\nProof. Consider the following object R[0] = (0 \u2192 R) of the abelian 2-category Ac . It is\n[1]\nobvious that R[0] is a small and projective in the abelian 2-category Ac , to show that it is\n[1]\nalso a generator take any object A = (A1 \u2192 A0 ) in Ac and consider a projective resolution\n[1]\nP\u2217 \u2192 A1 in the classical sense. Based on the description of cokernels of morphism of Ac\ngiven in [25] it is obvious that A is equivalent to the relative cokernel of the diagram\n\n0\n\u03b1\n\nP1 [0]\n/\n\n\u001f\u001f KS \u001f\u001f\n\nP0 [0]\n/\n\n!\n\nA0 [0]\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the trivial track. So we can apply Theorem 1 and the fact that the 2-ring\nHomA[1]\n(P [0], P [0]) is isomorphic to R considered as a discrete 2-ring to finish the proof.\nc\n\u0003\n\n3. Morita Equivalence\nTwo 2-rings R and S are called Morita equivalent provided the 2-categories of 2-modules\nover R and S are 2-equivalent. Based on the tensor product developed by Vincent Schmitt\n[30] lots of materials on Morita contexts [3] have 2-dimensional analogues. Details left to\nthe interesting readers. Here we restrict ourself only with the following consequence of our\nversion of the Gabriel-Mitchel theorem.\nTheorem 3. R and S are Morita equivalent iff there exist a small projective generator P in\nthe 2-category of 2-modules over R such that two rings S and HomR (P, P ) are equivalent.\nProof. It suffices to observe that under 2-equivalences small projective generators corresponds to small projective generators and then use Theorem 1.\n\u0003\n\n4. 2-chain complexes\nIn this section we fix an abelian 2-category T.

Following to [6] we call H\u2217 (A\u2217 ) the\nsecondary homology of A\u2217 . Let us recall the definition. Let Zn (A\u2217 ) be the relative kernel\nKer(dn , \u2202n\u22121 ).

PIRASHVILI\n\nIf A\u2217 and B\u2217 are 2-chain complexes in a 2-abelian category T, one can introduce a new\n2-chain complex (Hom(A\u2217 , B\u2217 ), d, \u2202) whose n-th component is the product\nY\nHom(A\u2217 , B\u2217 )n =\nHomT (Ap , Bn+p )\np\n\nThe boundary map\n\nd : Hom(A\u2217 , B\u2217 )n \u2192 Hom(A\u2217 , B\u2217 )n\u22121\nis given by\n(df )p = dfp + (\u22121)p+1 fp\u22121 d\nwith following track\ndd(f ) \u21d2 d2 f + f d2 \u21d2 0\nwhere the first track comes from the distributivity law, while the second is the sum f \u2217 (\u2202) +\nf\u2217 (\u2202).\nThe objects of the symmetric categorical group H0 (Hom(A\u2217 , B\u2217 )) are known as 2-chain\nmaps from A\u2217 to B\u2217 , while morphisms of H0 (Hom(A\u2217 , B\u2217 )) form tracks of 2-chain maps.\nWe let 2Chain(T) be the 2-category of 2-chain complexes, 2-chain maps and tracks of\n2-chain maps. The corresponding homotopy category Ho(2Chain(T)) is the homotopy\ncategory of 2-chain complexes. Thus a 2-chain map is a pair (f, \u03c6), where f = (fn ) is a\nsequence of morphisms fn : An \u2192 Bn and \u03c6 = (\u03c6n ) is the sequence of tracks fn dn \u21d2 dn fn+1\nsatisfying an obvious coherence condition, similarly tracks (f, \u03c6) \u21d2 (f \u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ) are also pairs\n(h, \u03c8), where h = (hn ) is the sequence of maps hn : An \u2192 Bn+1 and \u03c8 = (\u03c8n ) is the\nsequence of tracks dn hn + fn \u21d2 g + hn\u22121 dn\u22121 satisfying an obvious coherence condition.\nThe secondary homology Hn defines an additive 2-functor\nHn : 2Chian(T) \u2192 T\nIn particular the Tackeuchi-Ulbrich homology is homotopy invariant, meaning that it factors trough the homotopy category Ho(2Chain(T)) of 2-chain complexes.\nObserve that if T : T \u2192 T\u2032 is an additive 2-functor between abelian 2-categories\nit induces a well-defined additive 2-functor 2Chian(T) \u2192 2Chian(T\u2032 ), which is twodimensional analogue on the degreewise action of an additive functor on chain complexes.\nA 2-chain map (f\u2217 , \u03c6\u2217 ) : A\u2217 \u2192 B\u2217 is called weak equivalence provided the induced\nmorphism in secondary homology H\u2217 (A\u2217 ) \u2192 H\u2217 (B\u2217 ) is an equivalence. We let D(T) be\nthe localization of the category Ho(2Chain(T)) with respect to weak equivalences. Here\nwe emphasise that the category D(T) exists provided T posses countable coproducts and\nhave enough projective objects. This can be proved essentially by repeating the argument\nof Samson Saneblidze given in [29]. It is not surprising that the category D(T) when it\nexists has a canonical triangulated category structure which is induced by the following\nmapping cone construction. Let (f\u2217 , \u03c6\u2217 ) : (A\u2217 , dA , \u2202 A ) \u2192 (B\u2217 , dB , \u2202 B ) be a 2-chain map.\nDefine 2-chain complex (C\u2217 , d, \u2202) by\nCn = An\u22121 \u2295 Bn\n\u0013\n\u0012 A\n\u2212d\nf\ndn =\n0\ndB\n\n\fON ABELIAN 2-CATEGORIES AND DERIVED 2-FUNCTORS\n\n9\n\n2\nwhile \u2202d\n\u0012 2 \u21d2 0 is the\u0013 composite of the canonical\n\u0012 A\n\u0013track (coming from the distribution)\nd \u2212df + f d\n\u2202\n\u03c6\nd2 \u21d2\nand by the track\n. The triangulated category D(T) is\n2\n0\nd\n0 \u2202B\ncalled the derived category of an abelian 2-category T.\nWe claim that this construction is not only an analogue of the classical construction of\nderived categories of abelian categories but also generalizes it. In fact, if A is an abelian\ncategory with enough projective objects then the derived category D(A) in the classical\n[1]\nsense and the derived category D(Ac ) in the new sense are triangulated equivalent. The\n[1]\nequivalence is given by the following functors. Define a triangulated functor D(Ac ) \u2192\nD(A) by the \"total complex\" construction (see for example Example 2. 11 in [6]). The\nfunctor in opposite direction is given as follows. If X\u2217 is a chain complex in A, first we\nhave to replace it by a weak equivalent one which consists of projective objects (here one\nneeds to assume that A has countable coproducts) and then apply the functor P 7\u2192 P [0]\n[1]\nto obtain a 2-chain complex. Here P [0] = (0 \u2192 P ) is an object in (A)c . One sees that\nthese constructions are mutually quasi-inverse functors.\nIt is a remarkable fact that the construction of a triangulated category from an abelian 2category is intimately related to the derived category construction in the brave new algebra.\nNamely, if R is a 2-ring and H(R) is the corresponding ring-spectrum constructed in [20]\nthen the derived category of 2-modules is triangulated equivalent to the derived category\nof H(R) in the brave new-algebra sense. The proof of this fact will appear in a forthcoming\npaper [27]. In particular, there is a ring spectrum \u039b = H(\u03a6), which is characterized by\nthe following properties: \u03c00 (\u039b) = Z, \u03c01 (\u039b) = Z/2Z, \u03c0i (\u039b) = 0, if i 6= 0, 1 and the first\nPostnikov invariant (as a ring spectrum) of \u039b is the generator of the third MacLane (i.e.\ntopological Hochschild) cohomology HML3 (Z, Z/2Z) = Z/2Z. Then D(SCG) and D(\u039b)\nare triangulated equivalent.\n\n5. Resolutions and Derived 2-functors\nLet T be an abelian 2-category with enough projective objects and A be an object in T.\nFollowing to [6] a left A-augmented 2-chain complex is a 2-chain map (\u01eb, \u01eb\u0302) : A\u2217 \u2192 A of\n2-chain complexes, where A is considered as a 2-chain complex concentrated in dimension\n0 with trivial differentials d = 0, \u2202 = 0 and (A\u2217 , d, \u2202) is a 2-chain complex with An = 0,\nn < 0. Moreover \u2202n equal to the identity track for n < 0 [6]. A left A-augmented 2-chain\ncomplex (\u01eb, \u01eb\u0302) : A\u2217 \u2192 A is called left resolution provided (\u01eb, \u01eb\u0302) is a weak equivalence. A\nleft resolution is called projective resolution provided An is projective for all n \u2265 0. This\nnotion is a particular case of a more general notion given in [6] and corresponds to the case\nwhen (in the notations [6]) b coincides with the class of all projective objects.\nThen we can summarize some results of [6] in the following proposition.\nProposition 5. Let T be an abelian 2-category with enough projective objects and let PR\nbe the full 2-subcategory of the 2-category 2Chian(T) consisting of projective resolutions.\nThen the 2-functor given by taking the 0-th secondary homology defines a 2-equivalence\nPR \u2192 T\n\n\f10\n\nT. PIRASHVILI\n\nFor the reader convenient we recall how to construct projective resolutions. Take an\nobject A \u2208 T and choose a projective object P0 together with a cofaithful morphism\n\u01eb : P0 \u2192 A0 . Let (K0 , i0 , \u03ba0 ) be the kernel of \u01eb, where i0 : K \u2192 P0 is a morphism and\n\u03ba0 : \u01eb\u25e6i0 \u21d2 0 is a track. Choose a projective object P1 together with a cofaithful morphism\n\u01eb1 : P1 \u2192 K0 . Now we set d0 = i0 \u01eb1 : P1 \u2192 P0 and \u01eb\u0302 = \u01eb\u22171 (\u03ba0 ) which is a track \u01eb \u25e6 d0 \u21d2 0.\nLet (K1 , i1 , \u03ba1 ) be the relative kernel Ker(d0 ; \u01eb\u0302). Choose a projective object P2 together\nwith a cofaithful morphism \u01eb2 : P2 \u2192 K1 and set d1 = i1 \u01eb2 : P2 \u2192 P1 , \u22020 = \u01eb\u22172 (\u03ba1 ) and\ncontinue this way.\nLet P be the full 2-subcategory of T which consists of projective objects. Then for any\nadditive 2-functor T : P \u2192 SCG one obtains a well-defined additive 2-functors Ln (T ) :\nT \u2192 SCG (called the secondary left derived 2-functors) by\nLn (T )(A) := Hn (T (P\u2217))\nwhere P\u2217 is a projective resolution of A. If one takes the Takeuchi-Ulbrich homology instead\nand get the Takeuchi-Ulbrich left derived functors, which are denote by Ln T , n \u2265 0. So\nby the very definition one has \u03c00 (Ln (T )) = Ln T . It follows then that \u03c01 (Ln (T )) = Ln+1 T\n(see Remark 3.2 in [13]).\nIn the following proposition we summarize the basic properties of derived functors.\nProposition 6. i) The secondary derived functors form a system of \u2202-functors.

Applying Lemma\n4 to the 2-exact sequence from i) we first get \u03c00 (L\u22121 (C)) = \u03c01 (L\u22122 (C)) = 0 and then\n\u03c00 (L0 (C)) = \u03c01 (L\u22121 (C)). The statement iii) is clear. To show iv) observe that the argument\nin ii) shows that T\u22121 (A) \u223c\n= \u03a3T0 (A).

By 2-exactness\nit suffice to show that the induced map \u03c01 T1 (A) \u2192 \u03c01 T0 (B) is a monomorphism, but this\nfollows from the fact that T1 P is discrete. Hence all functors Tn can be express in terms\nof T0 and we are done.\n\u0003\nObserve that theory of left derived functors have obvious analogue for right derived 2functors, both for covariant and contravariant case. Of course in covariant case we have to\nuse injective resolutions instead of projective ones.\nProposition 7. i) The secondary right derived functors of a 2-functor T : T \u2192 SCG form\na system of \u03b4-functors.

PIRASHVILI\n\n\u0003\n7. The homotopy category of SCG\nFor symmetric categorical groups S1 and S2 we have a groupoid (in fact a symmetric\ncategorical group [7]) Hom(S1 , S2 ). It follows from the result of [31] that the 2-category\nSCG is 2-equivalent to the 2-category of two-stage spectra (see also Proposition B.12 in\n[19]). Hence we can use the classical facts of algebraic topology to study SCG. Let \u0393AB\nbe the category of triples (A, B, a) where A and B are abelian groups and\na \u2208 hom(A/2A, B) = hom(A, 2 B)\nwhere 2 B = {b \u2208 B | 2b = 0}. A morphism (A, B, a) \u2192 (A1 , B1 , a1 ) is a pair (f, g) where\nf : A \u2192 A1 and g : B \u2192 B1 are homomorphisms, such that a1 f = ga. The functor\nk : Ho(SCG) \u2192 \u0393AB\nis defined by\nk(S) := (\u03c00 (S), \u03c01 (S), kS )\nwhere S is a symmetric categorical group and kS is the homomorphism induced by the\ncommutativity constrants in S.\nProposition 10. For any symmetric categorical groups S1 and S2 one has a short exact\nsequence of abelian groups\n(1)\n\n0 \u2192 Ext(\u03c00 (S1 ), \u03c01 (S2 )) \u2192 \u03c00 (Hom(S1 , S2 )) \u2192 \u0393AB(k(S1 ), k(S2 )) \u2192 0\n\nFurthermore one has also an isomorphism of abelian groups\n(2)\n\u03c01 (Hom(S1 , S2 )) \u223c\n= hom(\u03c00 (S1 ), \u03c01 (S1 ))\nProof. The second isomorphism is obvious, while the first one is Proposition 7.1.6 in [5]. \u0003\nWe see that the both categories Ho and \u0393AB are additive and the functor\nk : Ho \u2192 \u0393AB\nis additive. In fact it is a part of a linear extension of categories (see Lemma 7.2.4 and\nTheorem 7.2.7 in [5]). It follows from the properties of linear extensions of categories\n[4] that the functor k is full, reflects isomorphisms, is essentially surjective on objects\nand it induces a bijection on the isomorphism classes of objects. Moreover the kernel\nof k (morphisms which goes to zero) is a square zero ideal of Ho. Hence, for a given\nobject A of the category \u0393AB we can choose a symmetric categorical group K(A) such\nthat k(K(A)) = A. Such object exist and is unique up to equivalence. Moreover, for\nany morphism f : A \u2192 B we can choose a morphism of symmetric categorical groups\nK(f ) : K(A) \u2192 K(B), such that k(K(f )) = f . The reader must be aware that the\nassignments A \u2192 H(A), f 7\u2192 K(f ) does NOT define a functor \u0393AB \u2192 Ho. Having in\nmind relation with spectra, the construction K for the objects of the form (A, 0, 0) coincides\nwith Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum and in general case is consistent with Definition 7.1.5\nin [5].\n\n\fON ABELIAN 2-CATEGORIES AND DERIVED 2-FUNCTORS\n\n15\n\n8. Projective objects in SCG\nIn this section we prove the following theorem. Let us recall that the symmetric categorical group \u03a6 was defined in the introduction.\nTheorem 11. i) The symmetric categorical group \u03a6 is a small projective generator in\nSCG. In particular SCG has enough projective objects. Moreover, any projective object is\nequivalent to a coproduct of copies of \u03a6.\nii) For any 2-ring R the right module R is a small projective generator of the abelian\n2-category of 2-modules, in particular the abelian 2-category of 2-modules has enough projective objects.\nThe statement on 2-modules is a direct consequence of Yoneda lemma for 2-categories.\nThe statement on SCG is a consequence of Lemma 12 proved below.\nThanks to [21] a morphism f in SCG is faithful (resp. cofaithful) if underlying functor\nis faithful (resp. essentially surjective). Recall also that [21] a morphism F : S1 \u2192 S2 in\nSCG is essentially surjective if it is epimorphism on \u03c00 , while a morphism F : S1 \u2192 S2\nin SCG is faithful if it is monomorphism on \u03c01 . We can develop same sort of language\nin the category \u0393AB. A morphism f = (f0 , f1 ) in \u0393AB is essentially surjective if f0 is\nepimorphism of abelian groups. Moreover an object P in \u0393AB is projective of for any\nessentially surjective morphism f : A \u2192 B in \u0393AB the induced map\n\u0393AB(P, A) \u2192 \u0393AB(P, B)\nis surjective.\nIt is clear that a morphism F : S1 \u2192 S2 of symmetric categorical groups is essentially\nsurjective iff k(F ) : k(S1 ) \u2192 k(S2 ) is so in \u0393AB. For an abelian group M we introduce\ntwo objects in \u0393AB:\nl(M) := (M, M/2M, idM/2M ),\nM[0] = (M, 0, 0).\nLemma 12. i) If M is an abelian group and A = (A0 , A1 , \u03b1) is an object in \u0393AB, then\none has the following functorial isomorphism of abelian groups\n\u0393AB(l(M), A) = hom(M, A0 ).\nii) An object P is projective in \u0393AB iff it is isomorphic to the object of the form l(P )\nwith free abelian group P .\niii) \u03a6 is a projective object in SCG and any projective object in SCG is equivalent to a\ncoproduct of \u03a6.\niv) The 2-category of symmetric categorical groups have enough projective objects.\nProof. i) Assume f = (f0 , f1 ) : l(M) \u2192 A is a morphism in \u0393AB. So f0 : M \u2192 A0\nand f1 : M/2M \u2192 A1 are homomorphisms of abelian groups and the following diagram is\n\n\f16\n\nT. PIRASHVILI\n\ncommute\nM/2M\n\nId\n\n/\n\nM/2M\n\nf\u02c60\n\nf1\n\n\u000f\n\nA0 /2A0\n\n/\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u000f\n\nA1\n\nHere f\u02c60 is induced by f0 . It follows that f1 is completely determined by f0 . This proves\nthe result.\nii) Let P be a free abelian group and let A \u2192 B be an essentially surjective morphism\nin \u0393AB. Thus A0 \u2192 B0 is an epimorphism. It follows that hom(P, A0 ) \u2192 hom(P, B0 ) is\nepimorphism as well, hence by the virtue of i) the map \u0393AB(l(P ), A) \u2192 \u0393AB(l(P ), B)\nis surjective. Thus l(P ) is projective in \u0393AB. Conversely, assume P = (P0 , P1 , \u03c0) is a\nprojective object in \u0393AB. We claim that P0 is a free abelian group. In fact it suffice to show\nthat it is a projective object in the category Ab of abelian groups. Take any epimorphism\nof abelian groups f0 : A \u2192 B and any homomorphism of abelian groups g0 : P0 \u2192 B. We\nhave to show that g0 has a lift to A. Observe that f = (f0 , 0) : A[0] \u2192 B[0] is essentially\nsurjective in \u0393AB and g = (g0 , 0) : P \u2192 B[0] is a well-defined morphism in \u0393AB. By\nassumption we can lift g to a morphism g\u0303 : P \u2192 A[0], It is clear that g\u0303 = (g \u03030 , 0) for some\ng \u03030 : P0 \u2192 A. Clearly g0 = f0 \u25e6 g \u03030 . It follows that P0 is a free abelian group. Hence\nl(P0 ) is a projective object in \u0393AB. By i) the identity map defines a canonical morphism\ni = (IdP0 , i1 ) : l(P0 ) \u2192 P, which obviously is essentially surjective in \u0393AB. Since P is\nprojective it follows that there exist a morphism p = (IdP0 , p1 ) : P \u2192 l(P ) such that\ni \u25e6 p = IdP . Thus we have a commutative diagram\nP0 /2P0\n\n\u03c0\n\nP1\n/\n\np1\n\nId\n\n\u000f\n\nP0 /2P0\n\nId\n\n/\n\n\u000f\n\nP0 /2P0\ni1\n\nId\n\n\u000f\n\nP0 /2P0\n\n\u03c0\n\n/\n\n\u000f\n\nP1\n\nwith i1 p1 = IdP1 . It follows that p1 and i1 are mutually inverse isomorphisms of abelian\ngroups. Hence p : P \u2192 l(P ) and l : l(P ) \u2192 P are mutually inverse isomorphisms in \u0393AB.\niii) First of all observe that k(\u03a6) = l(Z). Hence our assertion is equivalent to the\nfollowing one: For any free abelian group P the symmetric categorical group K(l(P ))\nis projective symmetric categorical group and conversely, if S is a projective symmetric\ncategorical group then \u03c00 (S) is a free abelian group S is equivalent to H(l(\u03c00 (S))). To\nprove it, let F : S1 \u2192 S2 be an essentially surjective morphism of symmetric categorical\ngroups and G : K(l(P )) \u2192 S2 be a morphism of symmetric categorical groups. Apply the\nfunctor k to get morphisms k(F ) : k(S1 ) \u2192 k(S2 ) and k(G) : l(P ) \u2192 k(S2 ) in \u0393AB. Since\n\u03c00 (F ) : \u03c00 (S1 ) \u2192 \u03c00 (S2 ) is an epimorphism of abelian groups it follows that k(F ) : k(S1 ) \u2192\nk(S2 ) is an essentially surjective morphism in \u0393AB. Since P is a free abelian group l(P ) is\n\n\fON ABELIAN 2-CATEGORIES AND DERIVED 2-FUNCTORS\n\n17\n\nprojective in \u0393AB by ii). Thus we can lift k(F ) to get a morphism \u011d : l(P ) \u2192 k(S1 ) such\nthat k(F ) \u25e6 \u011d = k(G) holds in \u0393AB(l(P ), k(S2 )). Since P = \u03c00 (K(l(P )) is free abelian\ngroup the Ext-term in the exact sequence (1) disappears and we get the isomorphism\n(3)\n\u03c00 (Hom(K(l(P )), Si )) \u223c\n= \u0393AB(l(P ), k(Si )), i = 0, 1\nTake a morphism L : K(l(P ) \u2192 S1 of symmetric categorical groups which corresponds\nto the morphism \u011d : l(P ) \u2192 k(S1 ). By our construction one has an equality k(F L) =\nk(G) in \u0393AB(l(P ), k(S2 )) = \u03c00 (Hom(H(l(P )), S2)). Thus the classes of F L and of G\nin \u03c00 (Hom(K(l(P )), S1 )) are the same. Hence there exist a track from F L to G. This\nshows that K(l(P )) is a projective symmetric categorical group. Conversely assume S is\na projective symmetric categorical group. Since S and K(k(S)) are equivalent, it follows\nthat K(k(S)) is also projective. We claim that k(S) is projective in \u0393AB. In fact take\nany essentially surjective morphism f = (f0 , f1 ) : A \u2192 B and any morphism g : k(S) \u2192 B\nin \u0393AB. Then K(f ) : K(A) \u2192 K(B) is essentially surjective in SCG. Hence for K(g) :\nK(k(S)) \u2192 K(B) we have a morphism G\u0303 : K(k(S)) \u2192 K(A) and a track K(f )\u25e6 G\u0303 \u2192 K(g).\nThus K(f ) \u25e6 G\u0303 = K(g) in \u03c00 (Hom(K(k(S)), K(B))). Now apply the functor k to get the\nequality f \u25e6 k(G\u0303) = g, showing that k(S) is projective in \u0393AB. Hence k(S) is isomorphic\nto l(P ) for a free abelian group P . Thus S and K(l(P ) are equivalent.\niv) Let S be a symmetric categorical group. Choose a free abelian group P and an\nepimorphism of abelian groups f0 : P \u2192 \u03c00 (S). By Lemma 12 it has a unique extension\nto a morphism f = (f0 , f1 ) : l(P ) \u2192 k(S) which is essentially surjective. Since P is a free\nabelian group, we have the isomorphism (3), which show that there exist a morphism of\nsymmetric categorical groups K(l(P )) \u2192 S which realizes f0 on the level of \u03c00 . Clearly\nthis morphism does the job.\n\u0003\nProposition 13. The 2-category of symmetric categorical groups is 2-equivalent to the\ncategory of right categorical modules over the categorical ring \u03a6.\nProof. Since \u03a6 is a small projective generator the 2-category of symmetric categorical\ngroups is 2-equivalent to the category of right categorical modules over the categorical ring\nHom(\u03a6, \u03a6). Observe that we have an obvious morphisms of 2-rings \u03a6 \u2192 Hom(\u03a6, \u03a6)\nwhich sends the object n to the endomorphism of \u03a6 which on objects is given by x 7\u2192 nx.\nIt remains to show that this morphism of 2-rings is an equivalence. But this easily follows\nfrom the exact sequence 1.\n\u0003\n9. Injective objects\nIn this section we prove the following result.\nTheorem 14.

It is clear that a morphism F : S1 \u2192 S2 of symmetric categorical groups is\nfaithful iff k(F ) : k(S1 ) \u2192 k(S2 ) is faithful in \u0393AB. For an abelian group M we introduce\ntwo objects in \u0393AB:\nr(M) = (2 M, M, id2 M ),\nM[1] = (0, M, 0).\nLemma 15. i) If M is an abelian group and A = (A0 , A1 , \u03b1) is an object in \u0393AB, then\none has the following functorial isomorphism of abelian groups\n\u0393AB(A, r(M)) = hom(A1 , M).\nii) An object Q is an injective object in \u0393AB iff it isomorphic to the object of the form\nr(Q) with divisible abelian group Q.\niii) For any divisible abelian group Q the symmetric categorical group K(r(Q)) is injective. Conversely, if S is an injective categorical group then \u03c01 (S) is a divisible abelian\ngroup and S is equivalent to K(r(\u03c01 (S))).\niv) The 2-category of symmetric categorical groups have enough injective objects.\nv) Let R be a categorical group. Then the category of categorical right R-modules have\nenough injective objects.\nProof. i) Assume g = (g0 , g1 ) : A \u2192 r(M) is a morphism in \u0393AB i in \u0393AB. So g0 : A0 \u21922\nM and g1 : A1 \u2192 M are homomorphisms of abelian groups and we have a commutative\ndiagram:\nA0\n\n\u03b1\n\n2 A1\n\n/\n\ng0\n\ni\n\nA1\n/\n\ng1\n\ng \u03041\n\n\u000f\n\n2M\n\nId\n\n/\n\n\u000f\n\n2M\n\nj\n\n/\n\n\u000f\n\nM\nwhere g \u03041 is induced by g1 and i, j are inclusions. It follows that g0 is completely determined\nby g1 and the result follows.\nii) Let Q be a divisible abelian group and let A \u2192 B be a faithful morphism in \u0393AB.\nThus A1 \u2192 B1 is a monomorphism. Since Q is an injective object in Ab it follows\nthat hom(B1 , Q) \u2192 hom(A1 , Q) is an epimorphism of abelian groups. So by i) the map\n\u0393AB(B, r(Q)) \u2192 \u0393AB(A, r(Q)) is surjective. Thus r(Q) is injective in \u0393AB.\nConversely, assume Q = (Q0 , Q1 , \u03c7) is an injective in \u0393AB. We claim that Q1 is a\ndivisible abelian group. In fact it suffice to show that it is an injective object in the category\nAb. Take any monomorphism of abelian groups f1 : A \u2192 B and any homomorphism of\nabelian groups g1 : A1 \u2192 Q0 . We have to show that g1 has a lift to B1 . Observe that\nf = (0, f1 ) : A[1] \u2192 B[1] is faithful in \u0393AB and g = (0, g1) : A[1] \u2192 Q is a well-defined\nmorphism in \u0393AB. By assumption there exists a morphism g\u0303 : B[1] \u2192 Q, It is clear\nthat g\u0303 = (0, g \u03031 ) for some g \u03031 : B \u2192 Q1 . Thus Q1 is a divisible abelian group. Thus\nr(Q1 ) is an injective object in \u0393AB. By i) the identity map defines a canonical morphism\ni = (i0 , IdQ1 ) : Q \u2192 r(Q1 ), which obviously is faithful in \u0393AB. Since Q is injective it\n\n\fON ABELIAN 2-CATEGORIES AND DERIVED 2-FUNCTORS\n\n19\n\nfollows that there exist a morphism q = (q0 , IdQ1 ) : r(Q1 ) \u2192 Q such that q \u25e6 i = IdQ .

It follows that i0 is an isomorphism. Hence i : Q \u2192 r(Q1 ) is an\nisomorphism and we are done.\niii) Let F : S1 \u2192 S2 be a faithful morphism of symmetric categorical groups and G :\nS1 \u2192 K(r(Q)) be a morphism of symmetric categorical groups. Apply the functor k to\nget morphisms k(F ) : k(S1 ) \u2192 k(S2 ) and k(G) : k(S1 ) \u2192 r(Q)) in \u0393AB. Since \u03c01 (F ) :\n\u03c01 (S1 ) \u2192 \u03c01 (S2 ) is a monomorphism of abelian groups it follows that k(F ) : k(S1 ) \u2192 k(S2 )\nis a faithful morphism in \u0393AB. Since Q is a divisible abelian group, r(Q) is injective in\n\u0393AB by ii) and we can extend k(F ) to get a morphism \u011d : k(S2 ) \u2192 r(Q). Thus we have the\nequality \u011d \u25e6 k(F ) = k(G) in \u0393AB(k(S1 ), r(Q)). Since Q = \u03c01 (K(r(Q)) is divisible abelian\ngroup the Ext-term in the exact sequence (1) disappears and we get the isomorphism\n(4)\n\u03c00 (Hom(Si , K(r(Q)))) \u223c\n= \u0393AB(k(S1 ), r(Q)), i = 0, 1\nTake a morphism L : S2 \u2192 K(r(Q)) of symmetric categorical groups which corresponds to\nthe morphism \u011d : k(S2 ) \u2192 r(Q). By our construction one has an equality k(LF ) = k(G).\nThis is equality in \u03c00 (Hom(S1 , K(r(Q)))), which imply that the classes of LF and of G\nin \u03c00 (Hom(S1 , K(r(Q)))) are the same. Thus there exist a track from LF to G. This\nshows that K(r(Q)) is an injective symmetric categorical group. Conversely assume S is\nan injective symmetric categorical group. Since S and K(k(S)) are equivalent, it follows\nthat K(k(S)) is also projective. We claim that k(S) is injective in \u0393AB. In fact take any\nfaithful morphism f = (f0 , f1 ) : A \u2192 B in \u0393AB and any morphism g : A \u2192 k(S) in \u0393AB.\nThen K(f ) : K(A) \u2192 K(B) is faithful in SCG. Hence for K(g) : K(A) \u2192 K(k(S)) we have\na morphism G\u0303 : K(B) \u2192 K(k(S)) and a track G\u0303 \u25e6 K(f ) \u2192 K(g). Thus G\u0303 \u25e6 K(f ) = K(g)\nin \u03c00 (Hom(K(k(S)), K(B))). Now apply the functor k to get the equality k(G\u0303) \u25e6 f = g,\nshowing that k(S) is injective in \u0393AB. Hence k(S) is isomorphic to r(Q) for a divisible\nabelian group Q. Thus S and K(r(Q) are equivalent.\niv) Let S be a symmetric categorical group. Choose a divisible abelian group Q and\nmonomorphism of abelian groups f1 : \u03c01 (S) \u2192 Q. By Lemma 15 it has a unique extension\nto a morphism f = (f0 , f1 ) : k(S) \u2192 r(Q) which is essentially surjective. Since Q is divisible\nabelian group, we have the isomorphism (4), which show that there exist a morphism of\nsymmetric categorical groups S \u2192 K(r(Q)) which realizes f1 on the level of \u03c01 and we get\nthe result.\nv) We consider the 2-functor Hom(R, \u2212) from the 2-category of symmetric categorical groups to the 2-category of categorical right R-modules.

Recall that a G-module [15], [34] (or 2-representation of\nG) is a symmetric categorical group S together with a homomorphism of categorical groups\nG \u2192 Eq(S), where Eq(S) is the categorical group of symmetric monoidal autoequivalences\nof S. In the case, when G is discrete, Ulbrich [34] defined the cohomology groups HU\u2217 (G, S).\nMoreover in [15],[16] the authors considered even more general situation when G is arbitrary\nand S is assumed to be only braided and they managed to define the categorical groups\nHi (G, S) in dimensions i = 0 and i = 1.\nFor symmetric categorical groups one can define Hi (G, S) for all i. For discrete G the\nconnected components of Hi (G, S) are exactly the Ulbrich's groups. The main result of\nthis section claims that there is an equivalence between H\u2217 (G, S) and appropriate ext in\nthe abelian 2-category of G-modules.\nFor any symmetric categorical group S, we let M(G, S) be the symmetric categorical\ngroup of all functors from G to S. In fact M(G, S) has a natural G-module structure,\ninduced by the categorical group structure on G. If S is a G-module, then there is a\ncanonical morphism of G-modules\niS : S \u2192 M(G, S)\nwhich takes an object a \u2208 S to the constant functor with value a. Since\n\u03c01 M(G, S) = Maps(\u03c00 (G), \u03c01 (S))\nwe see that iS is faithful.\nFor a categorical group G we let Ner2 (G) be the nerve of G as itQis defined in [9]. For\na G-module S we let C n (G, S) be the symmetric categorical group N er2 (G)n S. Similarly\nto the classical case, there is a 2-cochain complex structure on C \u2217 (G, S) (details can be\nfind in [12]). The secondary cohomology of this complex is denoted by H\u2217 (G, S), while the\nTakeuchi-Ulbrich cohomology is denoted by HU\u2217 (G, S). By our definition the symmetric\ncategorical groups H0 (G, S) and H1 (G, S) coincides with one defined in [15],[16], while for\ndiscrete G the groups HU\u2217 (G, S) are the same as in [34].\nWe wish to relate these objects to the secondary ext. To do so, we observe that the\n2-category SCGG of G-modules have enough injective objects. In fact if Q is an injective\nobject in SCG, considered as a trivial G-module, then M(G, Q) is injective in SCGG .\nActually the 2-category SCGG of G-modules has a small projective generator Mf (G, \u03a6),\n\n\fON ABELIAN 2-CATEGORIES AND DERIVED 2-FUNCTORS\n\n21\n\nand hence is 2-equivalent to the 2-category of modules over a 2-ring. We will not need this\nfact, therefore we omit the proof of this fact.\nTheorem 16. Let G be a categorical group and S be a G-module, then\nH\u2217 (G, S) \u223c\n= Ext\u2217SCGG (\u03a6, S)\nwhere action of G on \u03a6 is trivial.\nProof. By iv) Proposition 6 it suffices to prove the following assertions\ni) HomSCGG (\u03a6, \u2212) \u223c\n= H0 (G, \u2212),\nii) If\n0\nf\n\nS1\n\n\u03b1\n\nKS\n\u001f\u001f \u001f\u001f\n\n/\n\nS2\n\ng\n\n/\n\n\u001d\n\nS3\n\nis an extension in SCGG , then\n0\n\nC n (G, S1 )\n\nf\n\n/\n\n\u03b1\nn\n\n\u001f\u001f KS \u001f\u001f\n\nC (G, S2 )\n\ng\n\n/\n\n%\n\nC n (G, S3 )\n\nis also an extension.\niii) If S is an injective object in SCGG , then Hn (G, S) = 0 for n > 1.\nThe assertion i) is easy consequence of the fact that\nHomSCG (\u03a6, S) \u223c\n= S.\nTo see the ii) one has to use the fact that the product of 2-exact sequences is also 2-exact\nand to show iii) one has to consider the canonical morphism iS : S \u2192 M(G, S). Since\nS is injective and iS is faithful it follows from Corollary 4.4 [7] that S is equivalent to a\ndirect summand of M(G, S). Hence it suffice to show that for any G-module S one has\nHn (G, M(G, S)) = 0 for n > 1. Since 'evaluation at unite' gives an explicit homotopy\nequivalence between S considered as a 2-chain complex concentrated in dimension zero\nand C \u2217 (G, S), the result follows.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] J.
