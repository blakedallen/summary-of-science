Recently, infinitely\ngenerated tilting modules over arbitrary associated rings have become of interest in and attracted increasingly\nattentions toward to understanding derived categories and equivalences of general rings ([1]-[6], [8]-[10],\n[19, 20], [35]-[38]). In this general situation, many classical results in the tilting theory appear in a very\ndifferent new fashion. For example, Happel's Theorem (see also [16]) on derived equivalences induced\nby infinitely generated tilting modules comes up with a new formulation in which quotient categories are\ninvolved (see [8]). This more general context of tilting theory not only renews our view on features of\nfinitely generated tilting modules, but also provides us completely different information about the whole\ntilting theory. Let us recall the definition of tilting modules over an arbitrary ring from [19].\nLet A be a ring with identity, and let T be a left A-module which may be infinitely generated. The module\nT is called a tilting module (of projective dimension at most 1) provided that\n(T 1) T has projective dimension at most one,\n(T 2) ExtiA (T, T (\u03b1) ) = 0 for each i \u2265 1 and each cardinal \u03b1, and\n(T 3) there exists an exact sequence 0 \u2192 A \u2192 T0 \u2192 T1 \u2192 0 of left A-modules, where T0 and T1 are\nisomorphic to direct summand of arbitrary direct sums of copies of T .\nIf, in addition, T is finitely presented, then we say that T is a classical tilting module. If the modules T0\nand T1 in (T 3) are isomorphic to direct summands of finite direct sums of copies of T , then we say that T is a\ngood tilting module, following [10]. Actually, each classical tilting module is good, furthermore, it is proved\nin [10] that, for an arbitrary tilting A-module T , there exists a good tilting A-module T \u2032 which is equivalent\nto T , that is, T and T \u2032 generate the same full subcategories in the category of all left A-modules.\nOne of the realizations of tilting modules is universal localizations. It is shown in [1] that every tilting\nmodule over a ring is associated in a canonical manner with a ring epimorphism which can be interpreted as a\nuniversal localization at a set of homomorphisms between finitely presented modules of projective dimension\nat most one.\nAs in the theory of classical tilting modules, a natural context for studying infinitely generated tilting\nmodules is the relationship of derived categories and equivalences induced by infinitely generated tilting\nmodules. In fact, if T is a good tilting module over a ring A, and if B is the endomorphism ring of T , then\nBazzoni proves in [8] that the total right derived functor RHom A (T, \u2212) induces an equivalence between the\n(unbounded) derived category D(A) of A and the quotient category of the derived category D(B) of B modulo\nthe full triangulated subcategory Ker(T \u2297LB \u2212) which is the kernel of the total left derived functor T \u2297LB \u2212.\nThus, in general, the total right derived functor RHom A (T, \u2212) does not define a derived equivalence between\nA and B. This is a contrary phenomenon to the classical situation (see [16]). The condition for A and B to be\nderived-equivalent depends on the vanishing of Ker(T \u2297LB \u2212). It is shown in [8] that Ker(T \u2297LB \u2212) vanishes\nif and only if T is a classical tilting module. From this point of view, the triangulated category Ker(T \u2297LB \u2212)\nmeasures how far a good tilting module is from being classical, in other words, the difference between the\ntwo derived categories D(A) and D(B). It is certainly of interest to have a little bit knowledge about the\n\n2\n\n\fcategories Ker(T \u2297LB \u2212) for infinitely generated tilting modules T . This might help us to understand some\nnew aspects of the tilting theory of infinitely generated tilting modules.\nThe main purpose of this paper is to give a characterization of the triangulated categories Ker(T \u2297LB \u2212)\nfor infinitely generated tilting modules T , namely, we show that if the tilting module T is good then the\ntriangulated category Ker(T \u2297LB \u2212) is equivalent to the derived category of a ring C, and therfore, there\nis a recollemment among the derived categories of rings A, B and C. Conversely, the existence of such a\nrecollement implies that the given tilting module T is good. More precisely, our result can be stated as\nfollows:\nTheorem 1.1. Let A be a ring, T a tilting A-module of projective dimension at most 1 and B the endomorphism ring of T .\n(1) If T is good, then there is a ring C, a homological ring epimorphism \u03bb : B \u2192 C and a recollement\namong the unbounded derived categories of the rings A, B and C:\nz\n\nD(C)\nd\n\nz\n/ D(B)\nd\n\nj!\n\n/ D(A) .\n\nsuch that the triangle functor j! is isomorphic to the total left derived functor A T \u2297LB \u2212. In this case, the\nkernel of the functor T \u2297LB \u2212 is equivalent to the unbounded derived category D(C) of C as triangulated\ncategories.\n(2) If the triangle functor T \u2297LB \u2212 : D(B) \u2192 D(A) admits a fully faithful left adjoint j! : D(A) \u2192 D(B),\nthen the given tilting module T is good.\nLet us remark that a noteworthy difference of Theorem 1.1(1) from the result [3, Proposition 1.7] is\nthat our recollement is over derived module categories of precisely determined rings, while the recollement\nin [3, Proposition 1.7] involves a triangulated category. Theorem 1.1(1) realizes this abstract triangulated\ncategory by a derived module category via describing the kernel of the functor T \u2297LB \u2212. Our result also\ndistinguishes itself from the one in [40] where C is a differential graded ring instead of a usual ring, and\nwhere the consideration is restricted to ground ring being a field.\nIf we apply Theorem 1.1 to tilting modules arising from ring epimorphisms, then we can see that, in most\ncases, the recollements given in Theorem 1.1 are different from the usual ones induced from the structure of\ntriangular matrix rings. The following corollary is a consequence of the proof of Theorem 1.1.\nCorollary 1.2. (1) Let R \u2192 S be an injective ring epimorphism such that TorR1 (S, S) = 0 and that R S has\nprojective dimension at most one. Then there is a recollement of derived module categories:\nu\n\nD(S \u2294R S\u2032 )\ni\n\nu\n/ D(EndR (S \u2295 S/R))\ni\n\n/ D(R) ,\n\nwhere S\u2032 is the endomorphism ring of the R-module S/R, and S \u2294R S\u2032 is the coproduct of S and S\u2032 over R.\n(2) Suppose that \u03bb : R \u2192 S is an injective homological ring epimorphism between commutative rings R\nand S. Then there is a recollement of derived module categories:\nu\n\nD(S \u2297R S\u2032 )\ni\n\nu\n/ D(EndR (S \u2295 S/R))\ni\n\n/ D(R) ,\n\nwhere S\u2032 := EndR (S/R) is a commutative ring, and S \u2297R S\u2032 is the tensor product\nof S \u0013\nand S\u2032 over R.\n\u0012\nQ Qp\nadmits two stratifica(3) For every prime number p \u2265 2, the derived category of the ring\n0 Zp\ntions, one of which clearly has composition factors Q and Z p , and the other has composition factors Q(p)\nand Q p , where Q(p) , Q, Z p and Q p denote the rings of p-integers, rational numbers, p-adic integers and\np-adic numbers, respectively.\n3\n\n\fAs pointed out in [4]), the Jordan-H\u00f6lder theorem fails for stratifications of derived module categories by\ntriangulated categories. Our Corollary 1.2(3) (see also the example in Section 8 below) shows that the JordanH\u00f6lder theorem fails even for stratifications of derived module categories by derived module categories, and\ntherefore the problem posed in [4] gets a negative answer.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we recall some definitions, notations and useful results\nwhich are needed for our proofs. In Section 3, we shall first establish a connection between universal localizations and recollements of triangulated categories, and then prove Proposition 3.5 which is crucial for the\nproof of the main result. In Section 4, we discuss some homological properties of good tilting modules, and\nestablish another crucial result, Proposition 4.6, for the proof of the main result Theorem 1.1. After these\npreparations, we apply the results obtained in Section 3 to prove Theorem 1.1(1). In Section 5, we prove\nthe second part of Theorem 1.1. This may be regarded as a converse statement of the first part. In Section 6, we apply Theorem 1.1 to good tilting modules arising from ring epimorphisms, and prove Corollary\n1.2(1). In these cases the universal localization rings in Theorem 1.1 can be given by coproducts of rings.\nOur discussion in this section is actually carried out under the general assumption of injective homological\nring epimorphisms. In Section 7, we first consider the existence of the recollements in Theorem 1.1 for\ncommutative rings without assumption that the involved modules are tilting modules, and then make special\nconsideration of localizations of commutative one-Gorestein rings. In particular, we prove Corollary 1.2(2)\nand Corollary 1.2(3). It turns out that many derived module categories of rings possess stratifications by\nderived module categories of rings, such that, even up to ordering and up to derived equivalence, not all of\ntheir composition factors are the same; for instance, the derived category of the endomorphism ring of the\nabelian group Q \u2295 Q/Z (or its variation Q \u2295 Q/Q(p) ). Note that, in the examples presented in this section,\nthe two stratifications all have the same lengths. In Section 8, we give an example of a non-commutative\nalgebra over which the derived category of the endomorphism ring of a tilting module has two stratifications\nof different finite lengths. This, together with the examples in Section 7, gives a complete answer to an open\nproblem in [4] negatively.\nThe research work of the corresponding author C.C.Xi is partially supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2009SD-17), while the author H.X.Chen is supported by the Doctor Funds of the Beijing Normal University. Also, C.C.Xi thanks Lidia Angeleri-H\u00fcgel for some discussions\non localizations of commutative rings.\n\n2 Preliminaries\nIn this section, we shall recall some definitions, notations and basic results which are related to our proofs.\nIn particular, we recall the notions of recollements and TTF triples as well as their relationship.\n\n2.1 Some conventions\nIn this subsection, we recall some standard notations which will be used throughout this paper.\nAll rings considered in this paper are assumed to be associative and with identity, and all ring homomorphisms preserve identity.\nLet A be a ring. We denote by A-Mod the category of all unitary left A-modules. For an A-module M, we\ndenote by add(M) (respectively, Add(M)) the full subcategory of A-Mod consisting of all direct summands\nof finite (respectively, arbitrary) direct sums of copies of M. In many circumstances, we shall write A-proj\nand A-Proj for add(A A) and Add(A A), respectively. If I is an index, we denote by M (I) the direct sum of I\ncopies of M. If there is a surjective homomorphism from M (I) to an A-module X , we say that X is generated\nby M, or M generates X . By Gen(M) we denote the full subcategory of A-Mod generated by M.\n\n4\n\n\fIf f : M \u2192 N is a homomorphism of A-modules, then the image of x \u2208 M under f is denoted by (x) f instead of f (x). Also, for any A-module X , the induced morphisms HomA (X , f ) : HomA (X , M) \u2192 HomA (X , N)\nand HomA ( f , X ) : HomA (N, X ) \u2192 HomA (M, X ) is denoted by f \u2217 and f\u2217 , respectively.\nLet C be an additive category.\nGiven two morphisms f : X \u2192 Y and g : Y \u2192 Z in C , we denote the composition of f and g by f g which\nis a morphism from X to Z, while we denote the composition of a functor F : C \u2192 D between categories C\nand D with a functor G : D \u2192 E between categories D and E by GF which is a functor from C to E . The\nimage of the functor F is denoted by Im(F) which is a full subcategory of D .\nThroughout the paper, a full subcategory D of C is always assumed to be closed under isomorphisms,\nthat is, if X and Y are objects in C , then Y \u2208 D whenever Y \u2243 X with X \u2208 D .\nLet Y be a full subcategory of C . By Ker(HomC (\u2212, Y )) we denote the left orthogonal subcategory with\nrespect to Y , that is, the full subcategory of C consisting of the objects X such that HomC (X ,Y ) = 0 for all\nobjects Y in Y . Similarly, Ker(HomC (Y , \u2212)) stands for the right orthogonal subcategory of C with respect\nto Y .\ndi\n\nX\nBy a complex X \u2022 over C we mean a sequence of morphisms dXi between objects X i in C : * * * \u2192 X i \u2212\u2192\n\nd i+1\n\nX\nX i+1 \u2212\u2212\n\u2192 X i+2 \u2192 * * * , such that dXi dXi+1 = 0 for all i \u2208 Z. In this case, we write X \u2022 = (X i , dXi )i\u2208Z , and call dXi\na differential of X \u2022 . Sometimes, for simplicity, we write (X i )i\u2208Z for X \u2022 without mentioning the morphisms\ndXi . For a fixed integer n, we denote by X \u2022 [n] the complex obtained from X \u2022 by shifting n degrees, that is,\n(X \u2022 [n])0 = X n , and H n (X \u2022 ) the cohomology of X \u2022 in degree n.\nLet C (C ) be the category of all complexes over C with chain maps, and K (C ) the homotopy category\nof C (C ). We denote by C b (C ) and K b (C ) the full subcategories of C (C ) and K (C ) consisting of bounded\ncomplexes over C , respectively. When C is abelian, the derived category of C is denoted by D(C ), which\nis the localization of K (C ) at all quasi-isomorphisms. The full subcategory of D(C ) consisting of bounded\ncomplexes over C is denoted by D b (C ). As usual, for a ring A, we simply write C (A) for C (A-Mod),\nK (A) for K (A-Mod), C b (A) for C b (A-Mod), and K b (A) for K b (A-Mod). Similarly, we write D(A) and\nD b (A) for D(A-Mod) and D b (A-Mod), respectively. Furthermore, we always identify A-Mod with the full\nsubcategory of D(A) consisting of all stalk complexes concentrated on degree zero.\nNow we recall some basic facts about derived functors defined on derived module categories. We refer\nto [14] for details and proofs.\nLet R and S be rings, and let H be an additive functor from R-Mod to S-Mod.\n(1) For each complex X \u2022 in D(R), there is a complex I \u2022 \u2208 C (R-Inj) such that X \u2022 is quasi-isomorphic\n\u2022\nto I , where R-Inj is the full subcategory of R-Mod consisting of all injective R-modules. Dually, for each\ncomplex Y \u2022 in D(R), there is a complex P\u2022 \u2208 C (R-Proj) such that P\u2022 is quasi-isomorphic to Y \u2022 .\n(2) There is a total right derived functor RH and a total left derived functor LH defined on D(R). If\nX \u2022 ,Y \u2022 \u2208 D(R), then RH(X \u2022) = H(I \u2022 ) and LH(Y \u2022 ) = H(P\u2022 ), where I \u2022 and P\u2022 are chosen as in (1). Here\nwe think of H \u0001as an induced functor between homotopy categories, and if X \u2022 = (X i , dXi )i\u2208Z then H(X \u2022 ) :=\nH(X i), H(dXi ) i\u2208Z .\nIn case T is an R-S-bimodule, the total right derived functor of HomR (T, \u2212) is denoted by RHomA (T, \u2212),\nand the total left derived functor of T \u2297B \u2212 is denoted by T \u2297LB \u2212.\n(3) Any adjoint pair of functors (G, H) between R-Mod and S-Mod induces an adjoint pair (LG, RH)\nbetween the unbounded derived categories of R and S.\n\n2.2 Homological ring epimorphisms\nLet R and S be rings. Recall that a homomorphism \u03bb : R \u2192 S of rings is called a ring epimorphism if, for any\ntwo homomorphisms f1 , f2 : S \u2192 T of rings, the equality \u03bb f1 = \u03bb f2 implies that f1 = f2 . It is known that \u03bb is a\nring epimorphism if and only if the multiplication map S \u2297R S \u2192 S is an isomorphism as S-S-bimodules if and\n\n5\n\n\fonly if x \u2297 1 = 1 \u2297 x in S \u2297R S for any x \u2208 S. It follows that, for a ring epimorphism, we have X \u2297S Y \u2243 X \u2297R Y\nfor any S-modules XS and SY . An example of ring epimorphisms is the inclusion Z \u0592\u2192 Q. Note that Q is an\ninjective and a flat Z-module.\nGiven a ring epimorphism \u03bb : R \u2192 S between two rings R and S, we can regard S-Mod as a full subcategory\nof R-Mod via \u03bb. This means that HomS (X ,Y ) \u2243 HomR (X ,Y ) for all S-modules X and Y .\nTwo ring epimorphisms \u03bb : R \u2192 S and \u03bb\u2032 : R \u2192 S\u2032 are said to be equivalent if there is a ring isomorphism\n\u03c8 : S \u2192 S\u2032 such that \u03bb\u2032 = \u03bb\u03c8. This defines an equivalence relation on the class of ring epimorphisms R \u2192 S\nwith R fixed. The equivalence classes with respect to this equivalence relation are called the epiclasses of R.\nThis notion is associated with bireflective subcategories of module categories.\nRecall that a full subcategory D of R-Mod is said to be reflective if every R-module X admits a D reflection, that is, there exists an R-module D\u2032 \u2208 D and a homomorphism f : D\u2032 \u2192 X of R-modules such\nthat HomR (D, f ) : HomR (D, D\u2032 ) \u2192 HomR (D, X ) is an isomorphism as abelian groups for any module D \u2208 D .\nDually, one defines the notion of coreflective subcategories of R-Mod. The full subcategory D of R-Mod is\ncalled bireflective if it is both reflective and coreflective.\nRing epimorphisms are related to bireflective subcategories in the following way.\nLemma 2.1. [1, Theorm 1.4] For a full subcategory D of R-Mod, the following statements are equivalent.\n(1) There is a ring epimorphism \u03bb : R \u2192 S such that the category D is the image of the restriction functor\n\u03bb\u2217 : S-Mod \u2192 R-Mod.\n(2) D is a bireflective subcategory of R-Mod.\n(3) D is closed under direct sums, products, kernels and cokernels.\nThus, there is a bijection between the epiclasses of R and the bireflective subcategories of R-Mod. Furthermore, the map \u03bb : R \u2192 S in (1), viewed as a homomorphism of R-modules, is a D -reflection of R.\nFollowing Geigle and Lenzing [23], we say that a ring epimorphism \u03bb : R \u2192 S is homological if TorRi (S, S) =\n0 for all i > 0. This is equivalent to saying that the restriction functor \u03bb\u2217 : D(S) \u2192 D(R) induced by \u03bb is fully\nfaithful. In [23, Theorem 4.4], the following lemma is proved.\nLemma 2.2. [23, Theorem 4.4] For a homomorphism \u03bb : R \u2192 S of rings, the following assertions are equivalent:\n(1) \u03bb is homological,\n(2) For all right S-modules X and all left S-modules Y , the natural map TorRi (X ,Y ) \u2192 TorSi (X ,Y ) is an\nisomorphism for all i \u2265 0.\n(3) For all S-modules X and Y , the natural map ExtiS (X ,Y ) \u2192 ExtiR (X ,Y ) is an isomorphism for all i \u2265 0.\nNote that the condition (3) in Lemma 2.2 can be replaced by the corresponding version of right modules.\nFor more details, one may look at [23] and [34, Section 5.3].\nOn ring epimorphisms, we have the following property which will be used in Section 7.\nLemma 2.3. Let g : \u039b \u2192 \u0393 and h : \u0393 \u2192 \u2206 be ring homomorphisms such that gh : \u039b \u2192 \u2206 is a ring epimorphism.\nThen h is a ring epimorphism. Suppose further that h is injective. If \u0393\u039b and \u039b \u2206 (respectively, \u039b \u0393 and \u2206\u039b ) are\nflat, then both g and h are homological ring epimorphisms.\nProof. By the definition of ring epimorphisms, we can readily show that h is a ring epimorphism. Note\nthat we always have the following commutative diagram:\n\u0393 \u2297\u039b \u0393\n\nh\u2297\u039b h\n\n/ \u2206 \u2297\u039b \u2206\n\u03bc2\n\n\u03bc1\n\n\u000f\n\n\u0393\n\nh\n\n6\n\n\u000f\n/ \u2206,\n\n\fwhere \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 are the canonical multiplication maps. Suppose that h is injective. If \u0393\u039b and \u039b \u2206 are flat, then\nthe map h \u2297\u039b h is injective. Since gh : \u039b \u2192 \u2206 is a ring epimorphism, the map \u03bc2 is an isomorphism. It follows\nthat \u03bc1 is injective, and therefore it is an isomorphism. This means that g : \u039b \u2192 \u0393 is a ring epimorphism.\nNote that \u0393\u039b is flat. Thus g is a homological ring epimorphism. To prove that h also is a homological ring\nepimorphism, we claim that \u0393 \u2206 is flat. In fact, this follows from Lemma 2.2 because g is a homological ring\nepimorphism and because \u2206 is flat as a \u039b-module. Similarly, we can prove that if \u039b \u0393 and \u2206\u039b are flat, then\nboth g and h are homological ring epimorphisms. \u0003\n\n2.3 Recollements and TTF triples\nIn this subsection, we first recall the definitions of recollements and TTF triples, and then state a correspondence between them.\nFrom now on, D denotes a triangulated category with small coproducts (that is, coproducts indexed over\na set), and [1] the shift functor of D .\nThe notion of recollements was first defined by Beilinson, Bernstein and Deligne in [11] to study \"exact\nsequences\" of derived categories of coherent sheaves over geometric objects.\nDefinition 2.4. Let D \u2032 and D \u2032\u2032 be triangulated categories. We say that D is a recollement of D \u2032 and D \u2032\u2032 if\nthere are six triangle functors as in the following diagram\ni\u2217\n\n~\n\nD \u2032\u2032`\n\ni\u2217 =i!\n\n/\n\nj!\n\nD_\n\n\u007f\n\nj! = j\u2217\n\n/\n\nD\u2032\n\nj\u2217\n\ni!\n\nsuch that\n(1) (i\u2217 , i\u2217 ), (i! , i! ), ( j! , j! ) and ( j\u2217 , j\u2217 ) are adjoint pairs;\n(2) i\u2217 , j\u2217 and j! are fully faithful functors;\n(3) i! j\u2217 = 0 (and thus also j! i! = 0 and i\u2217 j! = 0); and\n(4) for each object C \u2208 D , there are two triangles in D :\ni! i! (C) \u2212\u2192 C \u2212\u2192 j\u2217 j\u2217 (C) \u2212\u2192 i! i! (C)[1],\nj! j! (C) \u2212\u2192 C \u2212\u2192 i\u2217 i\u2217 (C) \u2212\u2192 j! j! (C)[1].\n\nRecollements are closely related to TTF triples which are defined in terms of torsion pairs. So, let us first\nrecall the notion of torsion pairs in triangulated categories.\nDefinition 2.5. [13] A torsion pair in D is a pair (X , Y ) of full subcategories X and Y of D satisfying the\nfollowing conditions:\n(1) HomD (X , Y ) = 0;\n(2) X [1] \u2286 X and Y [\u22121] \u2286 Y ; and\n(3) for each object C \u2208 D , there is a triangle\nXC \u2212\u2192 C \u2212\u2192 Y C \u2212\u2192 XC [1]\nin D such that XC \u2208 X and Y C \u2208 Y . In this case, X is called a torsion class and Y is called a torsion-free\nclass. If, in addition, X is a triangulated subcategory of D (or equivalently, Y is a triangulated subcategory\nof D ), then the torsion pair (X , Y ) is said to be hereditary (see [13, Chapter I, Proposition 2.6]).\n7\n\n\fNote that, if (X , Y ) is a torsion pair in D , then X = Ker(HomC (\u2212, Y )) which is closed under small\ncoproducts, and Y = Ker(HomC (X , \u2212)) which is closed under small products.\nDefinition 2.6. [13] A torsion torsionfree triple, or TTF triple for short, in D is a triple (X , Y , Z ) of full\nsubcategories X , Y and Z of D such that both (X , Y ) and (Y , Z ) are torsion pairs. In this case, X is said to\nbe a smashing subcategory of D .\nIt follows from [13, Chapter I.2.] that, associated with a TTF triple (X , Y , Z ) in D , there are seven\ntriangle functors demonstrated in the following diagram\ni\n\nXe\n\nL\n\n%\n\nDf\n\n&\n\nR\n\nU\n\nY f\n\n%\n\nDf\n\nV\n\nZ\n\nk\n\nj\n\nsuch that\n(1) i, j and k are canonical inclusions; and\n(2) (i, R), (L, j), (j, V) and (U, k) are adjoint pairs; and\n(3) the composition functor Ui : X \u2192 Z of th functors i and U is a triangle equivalence with the quasiinverse functor Rk which is the composition of the functors k and R.\nNote that if (X , Y , Z ) is a TTF triple in D , then it is easy to check that X , Y and Z are automatically\ntriangulated subcategories of D .\nObserve also that the existence of the functors R and L in the above diagram follows from the fact that\n(X , Y ) is a torsion pair in D (see [13, Chapter I, Proposition 2.3] for details). Furthermore, Y is closed under\nsmall coproducts and products.\nNow, we state a correspondence between recollements and TTF triples given in [29, Section 9.2] and [34,\nSection 4.2]. For more details, we refer the reader to these papers.\n\u0001\nLemma 2.7. (1) If D is a recollement of D \u2032 and D \u2032\u2032 in Definition 2.4, then j! (D \u2032 ), i\u2217 (D \u2032\u2032 ), j\u2217 (D \u2032 ) is a TTF\ntriple in D .\n(2) If (X , Y , Z ) is a TTF triple in D , then D is a recollement of X and Y as follows:\nL\n\nY_\n\n\u007f\n\nj\n\n/\n\ni\n\nD^\n\nV\n\nR\n\n/\n\nX.\n\nkUi\n\n2.4 Generators and compact objects\nIn this subsection, we shall recall some definitions and facts on generators in a triangulated category.\nGiven a class of objects U in D , we denote by Tria(U ) the smallest full triangulated subcategory of D\nwhich contains U and is closed under small coproducts. If U consists of only one single object U , then we\nsimply write Tria(U) for Tria({U}).\nDefinition 2.8. A class U of objects in D is called a class of generators of D if an object D in D is zero\nwhenever HomD (U [n], D) = 0 for every object U of U and every n in Z.\nAn object P in D is called compact if the functor HomD (P, \u2212) preserves small coproducts, that is,\nHomD (P, \u2295i\u2208I Xi ) \u2243 \u2295i\u2208I HomD (P, Xi ), where I is a set; and exceptional if HomD (P, P[i]) = 0 for all i 6= 0.\nThe object P is called a tilting object if P is compact, exceptional and a generator of D . Note that, for a\ncompact generator P, we have Tria(P) = D (see [34], for instance).\nThe category D is said to be compactly generated if D admits a set V of compact generators. In this\ncase, D = Tria(V ), and we say that D is compactly generated by V .\n8\n\n\fIt is well-known that, for a ring A, the unbounded derived category D(A) is a compactly generated\ntriangulated category, and one of its compact generators is A A. Moreover, a complex P\u2022 \u2208 D(A) is compact\nif and only if it is quasi-isomorphic to a bounded complex of finitely generated projective A-modules. The\nimportance of compact objects can be seen from the following lemma, due to Keller in [27, Corollary 8.4,\nTheorem 8.5].\nLemma 2.9. Let A be a ring. If P\u2022 is a compact exceptional object in D(A), then Tria(P\u2022 ) is equivalent to\nD(EndD(R) (P\u2022 )) as triangulated categories.\nThe following result is proved in [12, Proposition 5.14], which shows that, under certain natural assumptions, torsion pairs in compactly generated triangulated categories can be lifted to TTF triples.\nLemma 2.10. Let C be a compactly generated triangulated category which admits all small coproducts and\nproducts. Suppose that (Y , Z ) is a hereditary torsion pair in C . Then we have the following.\n(1) If Y is closed under all small products, then there exists a TTF triple (X , Y , Z ) in C . In this case, Y\nis compactly generated.\n(2) If Z is closed under all small coproducts, then there exists a TTF triple (Y , Z , W ) in C . In this case,\nZ is compactly generated.\nThe relationship between compact objects and TTF triples is explained in the next result, which states\nthat any set of compact objects in a triangulated category with small coproducts gives rise to a TTF triple.\nFor more details, we refer the reader to [13, Chapter III, Theorem 2.3; Chapter IV, Proposition 1.1].\nLemma 2.11. Let C be a triangulated category which admits all small coproducts. Suppose that P is a set\nof compact objects in C . Set X := Tria(P ), Y := Ker(HomC (X , \u2212)) and Z := Ker(HomC (Y , \u2212)). Then\n(X , Y , Z ) is a TTF triple in C . Moreover, Y coincides with the full subcategory of C consisting of the objects\nY such that HomC (P[n],Y ) = 0 for every P \u2208 P and n \u2208 Z.\n\n3 Universal localizations and recollements\nIn this section, we discuss the connection between universal localizations and recollements of triangulated\ncategories. In our considerations, homological ring epimorphisms and perpendicular categories will play a\nrole.\nNow, we fix a ring R, and suppose that \u03a3 is a set of homomorphisms between finitely generated projective\nR-modules. For each f : P\u22121 \u2192 P0 in \u03a3, we denote by P\u2022f the following complex of R-modules:\nf\n\n* * * \u2212\u2192 0 \u2212\u2192 P\u22121 \u2212\u2192 P0 \u2212\u2192 0 \u2212\u2192 * * * ,\nwhere P\u22121 and P0 are concentrated in the degrees \u22121 and 0, respectively.\nSet\n\u03a3\u2022 := {P\u2022f | f \u2208 \u03a3},\n\u03a3\u22a5 := {X \u2208 R-Mod | HomD(R) (P\u2022 , X [i]) = 0 for all P\u2022 \u2208 \u03a3\u2022 and all i \u2208 Z},\nD(R)\u03a3\u22a5 := {Y \u2022 \u2208 D(R) | H n (Y \u2022 ) \u2208 \u03a3\u22a5 for all n \u2208 Z},\nwhere H n (Y \u2022 ) is the n-th cohomology of the complex Y \u2022 . Note that some special cases of \u03a3\u22a5 have been\ndiscussed in literature (see, for example, [1, 3, 20, 23]). For example, the set \u03a3 consists of injective homomorphisms or only one single homomorphism. In those papers, such a category \u03a3\u22a5 is called the perpendicular\ncategory of \u03a3.\n\n9\n\n\fUniversal localizations were pioneered by Ore and Cohn, in order to study embeddings of noncommutative rings in skewfields.\nBefore recalling the definition of universal localizations, we mention the following result, due initially to\nCohen (see also [36]), which explains how universal localizations arise.\nLemma 3.1. [18] Let R and \u03a3 be as above. Then there is a ring R\u03a3 and a homomorphism \u03bb : R \u2192 R\u03a3 of rings\nwith the following properties:\n(1) \u03bb is \u03a3-inverting, that is, if \u03b1 : P \u2192 Q belongs to \u03a3, then R\u03a3 \u2297R \u03b1 : R\u03a3 \u2297R P \u2192 R\u03a3 \u2297R Q is an isomorphism of R\u03a3 -modules, and\n(2) \u03bb is universal \u03a3-inverting, that is, if S is a ring such that there exists a \u03a3-inverting homomorphism\n\u03c6 : R \u2192 S, then there exists a unique homomorphism \u03c8 : R\u03a3 \u2192 S of rings such that \u03c6 = \u03bb\u03c8.\nThe homomorphism \u03bb : R \u2192 R\u03a3 in Lemma 3.1 is a ring epimorphism with TorR1 (R\u03a3 , R\u03a3 ) = 0. It is called\nthe universal localization of R at \u03a3. It is easy to see that if R has weak dimension at most 1, then the\nlocalization \u03bb : R \u2192 R\u03a3 of R at any set \u03a3 is homological, and moreover, the weak dimension of R\u03a3 is also at\nmost 1 by Lemma 2.2.\nIf \u03a3 is a finite set, then we may assume that \u03a3 contains only one homomorphism since the universal\nlocalization at \u03a3 is the same as the universal localization at the direct sum of the homomorphisms in \u03a3.\nThe following result is a general formulation of the case discussed in [1] and [3]. Nevertheless, many\narguments of the proof there work in this general situation. We outline here a modified proof.\nProposition 3.2. (1) \u03a3\u22a5 is closed under isomorphic images, extensions, kernels, cokernels, direct sums and\nproducts.\n(2) \u03a3\u22a5 coincides with the image of the restriction functor \u03bb\u2217 : R\u03a3 -Mod \u2192 R-Mod induced by the ring homomorphism \u03bb defined in Lemma 3.1. In this sense, we can identify \u03a3\u22a5 with R\u03a3 -Mod via the homomorphism\n\u03bb.\n(3) D(R)\u03a3\u22a5 = Ker(HomD(R) (Tria(\u03a3\u2022 ), \u2212)).\nIn order to prove Proposition 3.2, we need the following known homological result.\nLemma 3.3. Suppose that W \u2022 = (W i )i\u2208Z is a complex in C (A-Proj) such that W n = 0 for all n \u2208 Z\\{\u22121, 0}.\nThen, for each X \u2022 \u2208 D(R) and n \u2208 Z, there is an exact sequence of abelian groups:\n0 \u2212\u2192 HomD(R) (W \u2022 , H n\u22121 (X \u2022 )[1]) \u2212\u2192 HomD(R) (W \u2022 , X \u2022 [n]) \u2212\u2192 HomD(R) (W \u2022 , H n (X \u2022 )) \u2212\u2192 0.\nProof. It is sufficient to show the statement for n = 0. In this case, it follows from the triangle W \u22121 \u2192\nW 0 \u2192 W \u2022 \u2192 W \u22121 [1] that the following diagram is commutative and exact:\nHomK (R) (W 0 [1], X \u2022 )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\u2243\ny\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nHomK (R) (W \u22121 [1], X \u2022 )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\u2243\ny\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 HomK (R) (W \u2022 , X \u2022 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\nHomK (R) W 0 , H \u22121 (X \u2022 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 HomK (R) W \u22121 , H \u22121 (X \u2022 )\n\nHomK (R) (W 0 , X \u2022 )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\u2243y\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nHomK (R) (W \u22121 , X \u2022 )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\u2243y\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\nHomK (R) W 0 , H 0 (X \u2022 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 HomK (R) W \u22121 , H 0 (X \u2022 ) .\n\nHere we use the fact that HomD(R) (P, X \u2022 [n]) = HomK (R) (P, X \u2022 [n]) \u2243 HomR (P, H n (X \u2022 )) for every projective\nmodule P and n \u2208 Z. Thus Lemma 3.3 follows.\nProof of Proposition 3.2. (1) Clearly, \u03a3\u22a5 is closed under isomorphic images and extensions. In the\nfollowing, we shall prove that \u03a3\u22a5 is closed under kernels and cokernels. Recall that \u03a3\u22a5 is defined to be the\nfull subcategory of R-Mod consisting of those R-modules X that HomD(R) (U \u2022 , X ) = HomD(R) (U \u2022 , X [1]) = 0\nfor all U \u2022 \u2208 \u03a3\u2022 . Suppose that f : Y \u2192 Z is a homomorphism between two modules Y and Z in \u03a3\u22a5 . Set\nK := Ker( f ), I := Im( f ) and C := coker( f ). Then we have two exact sequences of R-modules:\n0\u2192 K \u2192Y \u2192 I \u2192 0\n\nand\n10\n\n0 \u2192 I \u2192 Z \u2192 C \u2192 0.\n\n\fSince any short exact sequence in R-Mod can canonically be extended to a triangle in D(R), we get two\ntriangles in D(R):\nK \u2192 Y \u2192 I \u2192 K[1] and I \u2192 Z \u2192 C \u2192 I[1].\nFor convenience, we will write D(R) (X \u2022 ,Y \u2022 ) for the Hom-set HomD(R) (X \u2022 ,Y \u2022 ) for X \u2022 ,Y \u2022 \u2208 D(R). Let P\u2022 \u2208\n\u03a3\u2022 . Then, by applying D(R) (P\u2022 , \u2212) to these triangles, we obtain two long exact sequences of abelian groups\n0 \u2192 D(R) (P\u2022 , K) \u2192 D(R) (P\u2022 ,Y ) \u2192 D(R) (P\u2022 , I) \u2192 D(R) (P\u2022 , K[1]) \u2192 D(R) (P\u2022 ,Y [1]) \u2192 D(R) (P\u2022 , I[1] \u2192 0;\n0 \u2192 D(R) (P\u2022 , I) \u2192 D(R) (P\u2022 , Z) \u2192 D(R) (P\u2022 ,C) \u2192 D(R) (P\u2022 , I[1]) \u2192 D(R) (P\u2022 , Z[1]) \u2192 D(R) (P\u2022 ,C[1] \u2192 0.\nSince Y and Z lie in \u03a3\u22a5 , we know D(R) (P\u2022 ,Y ) = D(R) (P\u2022 , Z) = D(R) (P\u2022 ,Y [1]) = D(R) (P\u2022 , Z[1]) = 0. It follows\nthat D(R) (P\u2022 , K) = D(R) (P\u2022 , I) = 0, and so D(R) (P\u2022 , K[1]) = 0. This implies K \u2208 \u03a3\u22a5 . Similarly, we can conclude that I and C belong to \u03a3\u22a5 . Hence \u03a3\u22a5 is closed under kernels, images and cokernels. By the definition of\n\u03a3\u22a5 and the fact that Hom-funcors commute with products, we infer that \u03a3\u22a5 is closed under products. Since\n\u03a3\u2022 is a set of bounded complexes over finitely generated projective R-modules, these complexes are compact,\nand therefore \u03a3\u22a5 is closed under direct sums.\n(2) Observe that, for each element f : P\u22121 \u2192 P0 in \u03a3, there is a canonical triangle in D(R):\n(\u2217)\n\nf\n\nP\u22121 \u2212\u2192 P0 \u2212\u2192 P\u2022f \u2212\u2192 P\u22121 [1].\n\nIf, in addition, f is injective, then we have a short exact sequence of R-modules:\n(\u2217\u2217)\n\nf\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 P\u22121 \u2212\u2192 P0 \u2212\u2192 coker( f ) \u2212\u2192 0.\n\nIn this case, we get P\u2022f \u2243 coker( f ) in D(R). Note that the same statement as (2) is obtained in [1, Lemma\n1.6, Proposition 1.7] under the extra assumption that each element in \u03a3 is injective, where the sequence (\u2217\u2217)\nis used. In fact, this assumption is not necessary since we can replace (\u2217\u2217) by (\u2217) and modify the proof there\nto show the general case. For more details, we refer the reader to [1].\n(3) This follows directly from Lemma 2.11 and Lemma 3.3. \u0003\nCombining Lemma 2.1 with Proposition 3.2, we have the following result, which says that, in some\nsense, Morita equivalence preserves universal localization.\nCorollary 3.4. Let \u03bb : R \u2192 R\u03a3 be the universal localization of the ring R at the set \u03a3. Suppose that P is\na finitely generated projective generator for R-Mod. Set \u2206 := {HomR (P, f ) | f \u2208 \u03a3}. Then the ring homomorphism \u03bc : EndR (P) \u2192 EndR\u03a3 (R\u03a3 \u2297R P), defined by g 7\u2192 R\u03a3 \u2297R g for any g \u2208 EndR (P), is the universal\nlocalization of the ring EndR (P) at the set \u2206.\nProof. Let S := EndR (P). Since R P is a finitely generated projective generator for R-Mod, the Homfunctor HomR (P, \u2212) : R-Mod \u2192 S-Mod is an equivalence, which extends to a triangle equivalence between\nD(R) and D(S). By the definitions of \u03a3\u22a5 and \u2206\u22a5 , the restriction of HomR (P, \u2212) induces an equivalence\nfrom \u03a3\u22a5 to \u2206\u22a5 . Note that R\u03a3 \u2297R P is a finitely generated projective generator for R\u03a3 -Mod. Since the functor\n\u03bb\u2217 : R\u03a3 -Mod \u2192 R-Mod is fully faithful and since the image of \u03bb\u2217 coincides with \u03a3\u22a5 by Proposition 3.2(2), it\nfollows from the following commutative diagram of functors:\nR\u03a3 -Mod\n\nHomR\u03a3 (R\u03a3 \u2297R P,\u2212)\n\u2243\n\n/ EndR (R\u03a3 \u2297R P)-Mod\n\u03a3\n\n\u03bb\u2217\n\n\u03bc\u2217\n\n\u000f\n\nR-Mod\n\nHomR (P,\u2212)\n\u2243\n\n11\n\n\u000f\n\n/ S-Mod\n\n\fthat \u03bc\u2217 is fully faithful, and that the image of \u03bc\u2217 coincides with \u2206\u22a5 . This implies also that \u03bc is a ring epimorphism. Note that, under our conventions, full subcategories are always closed under isomorphic images.\nOn the other hand, if \u03c6 : S \u2192 S\u2206 is the universal localization of S at \u2206, then, by Proposition 3.2(2), the\nimage of \u03c6\u2217 coincides with \u2206\u22a5 . Thus the two ring epimorphisms \u03bc and \u03c6 are equivalent by Lemma 2.1. This\nmeans that the two rings S\u2206 and EndR\u03a3 (R\u03a3 \u2297R P) are isomorphic. Thus \u03bc is the universal localization of S at\n\u2206. \u0003\nMotivated by [30, Theorem 10.8], see also [3, Thereom 4.8 (3)], we shall establish the following connection between universal localizations and recollements of triangulated categories. The last condition (5) of\nProposition 3.5 below seems to appear for the first time in the work, and will be used in Section 4 to prove\nTheorem 1.1(1).\nProposition 3.5. (a) Let j be the canonical embedding of D(R)\u03a3\u22a5 into D(R). Then there is a recollement\nL\n\nw\n\nj\n\nD(R)\u03a3\u22a5\ng\n\n/ D(R)\n\nw\ng\n\n/ Tria(\u03a3\u2022 )\n\nsuch that L is the left adjoint of j and T \u2022 := L(R) is a compact generator of D(R)\u03a3\u22a5 .\n(b) The following statements are equivalent:\n(1) \u03bb : R \u2192 R\u03a3 is a homological epimorphism of rings;\n\u223c\n(2) \u03bb\u2217 : D(R\u03a3 ) \u2212\n\u2192 D(R)\u03a3\u22a5 ;\n(3) the complex T \u2022 in (a) is a tilting object in D(R)\u03a3\u22a5 ;\n(4) the complex T \u2022 in (a) is isomorphic to R\u03a3 in D(R);\n(5) the complex T \u2022 in (a) is isomorphic in D(R) to a complex X \u2022 := (X i )i\u2208Z such that X i \u2208 \u03a3\u22a5 for all\ni \u2208 Z.\nProof. The existence of the above recollement is an immediate consequence of Lemmata 2.7(2), 2.11\nand Proposition 3.2. The property in (a) follows from the proof in [13, Chapter IV, Proposition 1.1]. As to\nthe property (b), we notice that the equivalences among the first four statements in (b) can be deduced from\n[3, Proposition 1.7, Lemma 4.6]. Clearly, the statement (4) implies the statement (5). We shall show that (5)\nimplies (4).\nLet \u03bb : R \u2192 R\u03a3 be the universal localization of R at \u03a3. In what follows, we always identify \u03a3\u22a5 with\nR\u03a3 -Mod via \u03bb. This is due to Proposition 3.2(2).\nSuppose that T \u2022 \u2243 X \u2022 := (X i )i\u2208Z in D(R) such that X i \u2208 R\u03a3 -Mod for all i \u2208 Z. Since \u03bb is a ring epimorphism, we get HomR\u03a3 (X ,Y ) \u2243 HomR (X ,Y ) for all X ,Y \u2208 R\u03a3 -Mod. Thus X \u2022 can be considered as a\ncomplex over R\u03a3 -Mod, that is, X \u2022 \u2208 C (R\u03a3 ). Let \u03bb1 be the map HomD(R) (\u03bb, X \u2022 ) : HomD(R) (R\u03a3 , X \u2022 ) \u2192\nHomD(R) (R, X \u2022 ). We claim that \u03bb1 is surjective. In fact, there is a commutative diagram:\nHomK (R) (R\u03a3 , X \u2022 )\n\nq1\n\n/ HomD(R) (R\u03a3 , X \u2022 )\n\n\u03bb2\n\n\u000f\n\nHomK (R) (R, X \u2022 )\n\n\u03bb1\nq2\n\n\u000f\n\n/ HomD(R) (R, X \u2022 ),\n\nwhere \u03bb2 = HomK (R) (\u03bb, X \u2022 ), and q1 , q2 are induced by the localization functor q : K (R) \u2192 D(R). Clearly,\nq2 is a bijection. To prove that \u03bb1 is surjective, it suffices to show that \u03bb2 is bijective. Indeed, \u03bb2 is a\ncomposition of the following series of isomorphisms:\nHomK (R) (R\u03a3 , X \u2022 ) \u2243 H 0 (HomR (R\u03a3 , X \u2022 )) = H 0 (HomR\u03a3 (R\u03a3 , X \u2022 )) \u2243 HomK (R) (R, X \u2022 ),\n\n12\n\n\fwhere the equality follows from the fact that \u03bb is a ring epimorphism. More precisely, for f \u0304\u2022 := ( f i ) \u2208\nHomK (R) (R\u03a3 , X \u2022 ) with ( f i )i\u2208Z a chain map, the series of the above maps are defined by:\n( f i ) 7\u2192 f 0 = f 0 7\u2192 \u03bb\u2217 ( f \u2022 ),\nwhere \u03bb\u2217 ( f \u2022 ) is a chain map from R to X \u2022 with \u03bb f 0 in degree 0 and zero in all other degrees. Thus \u03bb2 is\nbijective, which implies that \u03bb1 is surjective. Now, let \u03bb\u2032 be the map HomD(R) (\u03bb, T \u2022 ) : HomD(R) (R\u03a3 , T \u2022 ) \u2192\nHomD(R) (R, T \u2022 ). Since T \u2022 \u2243 X \u2022 in D(R), we know that \u03bb\u2032 also is surjective. Suppose that \u03c6 : R \u2192 T \u2022 := L(R)\nis the unit adjunction morphism with respect to the adjoint pair (L, j). Then there exists g : R\u03a3 \u2192 T \u2022 in D(R)\nsuch that \u03c6 = \u03bbg. Since R\u03a3 belongs to D(R)\u03a3\u22a5 , there exists f : T \u2022 \u2192 R\u03a3 in D(R) such that \u03bb = \u03c6 f . This\ngives rise to the following commutative diagram in D(R):\nR\n\u03c6\n\nR\n\nR\n\u03c6\n\n\u03bb\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n\nf\ng\nT \u2022 _ _ _/ R\u03a3 _ _ _/ T \u2022 .\n\nConsequently, \u03c6 = \u03c6 f g and \u03bb = \u03bbg f . On the one hand, since \u03c6 is the unit adjunction morphism, we have\nf g = 1T \u2022 . On the other hand, it follows from [1, Theorem 1.4] that \u03bb is an R\u03a3 -Mod-reflection of R, that is,\nthe morphism of abelian groups HomR (\u03bb, Z) : HomR (R\u03a3 , Z) \u2192 HomR (R, Z) is bijective for any Z \u2208 R\u03a3 -Mod.\nThis yields g f = 1R \u03a3 . Thus f is an isomorphism. In other words, T \u2022 \u2243 R\u03a3 in D(R). Therefore, (5) implies\n(4). \u0003\nRemark. Note that every tilting module is associated to a class of finitely presented modules of projective\ndimension at most one (see [1, 9]) and thus to a universal localization since each finitely presented module\nof projective dimension at most one is determined by an injective homomorphism between finitely generated\nprojective modules. In Proposition 3.5, we do not require that each homomorphism in \u03a3 is injective. From\nthis point of view, the formulation of Proposition 3.5(b) seems to be more general than that in [3, Thereom\n4.8(3)].\nCorollary 3.6. Let R \u2286 S be an extension of rings, that is, R is a subring of the ring S with the same identity,\nand let B be the endomorphism ring of the R-module S \u2295 S/R. Then there is a recollement of triangulated\ncategories:\nw\n\nD(B)\u03a3\u22a5\ng\n\nx\n/ D(B)\nf\n\n/ D(R) ,\n\nwhere \u03a3 := {\u03c0\u2217 }, and the homomorphism \u03c0\u2217 : HomR (S \u2295 S/R, S) \u2192 HomR (S \u2295 S/R, S/R) of B-modules is\ndefined by f 7\u2192 f \u03c0 for any f \u2208 HomR (S \u2295 S/R, S), which is induced by the canonical map \u03c0 : S \u2192 S/R.\nProof. It follows from Proposition 3.5(a) that we have the following recollement:\nw\n\nD(B)\u03a3\u22a5\ng\n\n/ D(B)\n\nw\ng\n\n/ Tria(\u03a3\u2022 ) .\n\nTo show that Tria(\u03a3\u2022 ) is equivalent to D(R) as triangulated categories, it suffices to prove that the complex \u03a3\u2022 \u2208 K b (B-proj) is exceptional with EndD(B) (\u03a3\u2022 ) \u2243 R.\nIn fact, let R T := S \u2295 S/R and EndR (T ) = B. Then add(R T ) and B-proj are equivalent, and therefore\nK b (add(R T )) and K b (B-proj) are equivalent as triangulated categories via the functor HomR (T, \u2212). Thus,\nto show that the complex \u03a3\u2022 \u2208 K b (B-proj) is exceptional with EndD(B) (\u03a3\u2022 ) \u2243 R, it is sufficient to show that\nthe complex\n\u03c0\n\u03a0\u2022 : 0 \u2212\u2192 S \u2212\u2192 S/R \u2212\u2192 0\n13\n\n\fin K b (add(T )) is exceptional with EndK b (add(T )) (\u03a0\u2022 ) \u2243 R since HomR (T, \u03a0\u2022 ) = \u03a3\u2022 .\nIt is easy to see HomK b (add(T )) (\u03a0\u2022 , \u03a0\u2022 [\u22121]) = 0. To see HomK b (add(T )) (\u03a0\u2022 , \u03a0\u2022 [1]) = 0, we pick up\na homomorphism f : S \u2192 S/R of R-modules, suppose (1) f = s + R \u2208 S/R and define g : R S \u2192 R S by\nx 7\u2192 xs for x \u2208 S. Clearly, g is a homomorphism of R-modules and ( f \u2212 g)|R = 0. Thus there exists a\nhomomorphism h : S/R \u2192 S/R such that f \u2212 g = \u03c0h. This implies that f is zero in K b (add(T )), that is,\nHomK b (add(T )) (\u03a0\u2022 , \u03a0\u2022 [1]) = 0. Hence we have shown that \u03a0\u2022 is exceptional.\nNow, we define a ring homomorphism \u03b1 from EndK b (add(T )) (\u03a0\u2022 ) to R as follows: Given f = ( f 0 , f 1 ) \u2208\nEndK b (add(T )) (\u03a0\u2022 ), let ( f )\u03b1 be the unique map determined in the following diagram of R-modules:\n\u03bb\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u03bb\n\n\u03c0\n\n0 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 R \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 S \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n( f )\u03b1y\nf 0y\n\nS/R \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 0\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nf 1y\n\n0 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 R \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 S \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 S/R \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 0.\n\nNote that if f is null-homotopic then ( f )\u03b1 is zero. This means that \u03b1 is well-defined. Clearly, \u03b1 is a ring\nhomomorphism. We claim that \u03b1 is an isomorphism of rings. It is easy to check that \u03b1 is injective. We shall\nshow that \u03b1 is surjective. Let r \u2208 R. We define f 0 : S \u2192 S to be the right multiplication of r. Then there is a\nhomomorphism f 1 : S/R \u2192 S/R of R-modules such that f 0 \u03c0 = \u03c0 f 1 . This means that \u03b1 is surjective. Hence\n\u03b1 is an isomorphism of rings. So, \u03a3\u2022 is exceptional with EndD(B) (\u03a3\u2022 ) \u2243 R. By Lemma 2.9, we may identify\nTria(\u03a3\u2022 ) with D(R). This proves Corollary 3.6. \u0003\nAs another corollary of Proposition 3.5, we have the following result.\nCorollary 3.7. If the weak dimension of R is at most 1, then there is a recollement\nx\n\nD(R\u03a3 )\nf\n\n/ D(R)\n\nw\n\n/ Tria(\u03a3\u2022 ) ,\ng\n\nwhere \u03a3 is a set of homomorphisms between finitely generated projective R-modules.\nProof. Under the assumption, the universal localization map \u03bb\u03a3 is trivially a homological ring epimorphism. So, this corollary follows from Proposition 3.5(b). \u0003\nAs a consequence of Corollary 3.7, we have the following result which is a generalization of [4, Theorem\n2.5, Corollary 3.3].\nCorollary 3.8. Suppose that R is a left semi-hereditary ring (that is, every finitely generated submodule of a\nprojective left R-module is projective). If T \u2022 is a compact exceptional object in D(R), then there is a ring S,\na homological ring epimorphism \u03bb : R \u2192 S and a recollement\nx\n\nD(S)\nf\n\n/ D(R)\n\nv\n\n/ D(EndD(R) (T \u2022 )) .\nh\n\nProof. Since T \u2022 is a compact object in D(R), there exists a complex P\u2022 \u2208 K b (R-proj) such that T \u2022 \u2243 P\u2022\nin D(R). Suppose that P\u2022 is of the following form\ndi\n\n* * * \u2212\u2192 0 \u2212\u2192 Ps \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2212\u2192 Pi \u2212\u2192 Pi+1 \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2212\u2192 Pt \u2212\u2192 0 \u2212\u2192 * * * ,\nwhere Pi \u2208 add(R R) for s \u2264 i \u2264 t. Since R is left semi-hereditary, we have Im(d i ) \u2208 add(R R) for all i.\nThis implies that P\u2022 is isomorphic to a direct sum of finitely many two-term complexes in K b (R-proj), say\ns \u22121\n\nP\u2022 \u2243 \u2295ni=1 Pi\u2022 , where n \u2208 N and P\u2022j is of the form: 0 \u2192 Pj j\n14\n\ndj\n\ns\n\n\u2212\u2192 Pj j \u2192 0 with s j \u2208 Z for each 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n.\n\n\fNow we choose \u03a3 := {d j | 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n}. Then, by definition, we have \u03a3\u2022 = {P\u2022j [s j ] | 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n} (see notations\nat the beginning of Section 3). Consequently, Tria(T \u2022 ) = Tria(P\u2022 ) = Tria(\u03a3\u2022 ). Since T \u2022 is compact and\nHomD(R) (T \u2022 , T \u2022 [i]) = 0 for all i 6= 0, it follows from Lemma 2.9 that Tria(T \u2022 ) is triangle equivalent to the\nderived category D(EndD(R) (T \u2022 )) of EndD(R) (T \u2022 ). Note that R has weak dimension at most 1 because it is\nleft semi-hereditary. Thus the condition of Corollary 3.7 is fulfilled, and therefore Corollary 3.8 follows from\nCorollary 3.7 if we define S = R\u03a3 . \u0003\nIn general, it is hard to compute R\u03a3 . However, if \u03a3 consists of only one element with an orthogonal\nassumption, one can construct R\u03a3 explicitly in terms of endomorphism rings of modules. To this purpose,\nwe first establish the following result which generalizes [20, Proposition 1.3] where only stalk complexes (or\nmodules) were considered.\nProposition 3.9. Suppose that P\u2022 := (Pi )i\u2208Z is a complex in C (R-Proj) such that Pn = 0 for all n \u2208 Z\\{\u22121, 0}.\nDefine P\u2022\u22a5 := {X \u2208 R-Mod | HomD(R) (P\u2022 , X [i]) = 0 for all i \u2208 Z}. If HomD(R) (P\u2022 , P\u2022(\u03b4) [1]) = 0 for each\ncardinal \u03b4, then the inclusion j : P\u2022\u22a5 \u2192 R-Mod admits a left adjoint l : R-Mod \u2192 P\u2022\u22a5 .\nProof. The proof will be divided into three steps. We define X to be the full subcategory of R-Mod\nconsisting of the objects X such that HomD(R) (P\u2022 , X [1]) = 0. Then, it follows from HomD(R) (P\u2022 , X [1]) \u2243\nHomK (R) (P\u2022 , X [1]) for X \u2208 R-Mod that X is closed under quotients.\nLet M and N be R-modules.\nStep (1). For the given M, we shall construct an R-module, denoted by l(M), which belongs to P\u2022\u22a5 and\nis endowed with an R-homomorphism \u03b7M : M \u2192 l(M).\nSince P\u2022 \u2208 C b (R-Proj), we have HomD(R) (P\u2022 , M[1]) = HomK (R) (P\u2022 , M[1]). Let \u03b1 be a generating set of\nHomK (R) (P\u2022 , M[1]) as an EndD(R) (P\u2022 )-module. Thus each element of \u03b1 is a chain map from P\u2022 to M[1]. We\ndefine \u03c9M : P\u2022(\u03b1) \u2192 M[1] to be the coproduct of the elements of \u03b1. Then, it is clear that\n\u03c9\u2032M := HomD(R) (P\u2022 , \u03c9M ) : HomD(R) (P\u2022 , P\u2022(\u03b1) ) \u2212\u2192 HomD(R) (P\u2022 , M[1])\nis a surjective homomorphism of EndD(R) (P\u2022 )-modules. Let cone(\u03c9M ) be the mapping cone of \u03c9M , and\n\u2022\nM := cone(\u03c9M )[\u22121]. Then we obtain the following canonical triangle in D(R):\n\u03c6M\n\n\u03c8M\n\n\u2022\n\n\u03c9\n\nM \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 P\u2022(\u03b1) \u2212\u2212\u2212M\u2212\u2192 M[1],\n\n(\u2217)\n\nwhere \u03c6M and \u03c8M can be constructed explicitly. For more details, we refer the reader to any standard textbook\n\u2022\nof homological algebra (for instance, [39]). Note that the complex M is of the form\n\u2022\n\nM :\n\nd\n\nM\n* * * \u2212\u2192 0 \u2212\u2192 M \u22121 \u2212\u2192\nM 0 \u2212\u2192 0 \u2212\u2192 * * * ,\n\nwhere dM is a homomorphism between R-modules M \u22121 and M 0 , which are concentrated in the degrees \u22121\nand 0, respectively. Let C\u2022 denote the complex: 0 \u2192 Im(dM ) \u2192 M 0 \u2192 0. Then we have an exact sequence\n\u2022\n\u2022\nof complexes: 0 \u2192 H \u22121 (M )[1] \u2192 M \u2192 C\u2022 \u2192 0, this gives us an triangle\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nH \u22121 (M )[1] \u2192 M \u2192 C\u2022 \u2192 H \u22121 (M )[2].\n\u2022\n\nSince C\u2022 is quasi-isomorphic to the stalk complex H 0 (M ), we get the following triangle in D(R):\n(\u2217\u2217)\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 \u03b3M\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nH \u22121 (M )[1] \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 H 0 (M ) \u2212\u2192 H \u22121 (M )[2],\n\nwhere the chain map \u03b3M is induced by the homomorphism dM such that H 0 (\u03b3M ) = 1H 0 (M\u2022 ) . Applying\nHomD(R) (P\u2022 , \u2212) to (\u2217), we get a long exact sequence of EndD(R) (P\u2022 )-modules:\n\u03c9\u2032\n\n\u2022\n\nM\nHomD(R) (P\u2022 , P\u2022(\u03b1) ) \u2212\u2192\nHomD(R) (P\u2022 , M[1]) \u2212\u2192 HomD(R) (P\u2022 , M [1]) \u2212\u2192 HomD(R) (P\u2022 , P\u2022(\u03b1) [1]).\n\n15\n\n\f\u2022\n\nSince \u03c9\u2032M is surjective and HomD(R) (P\u2022 , P\u2022(\u03b1) [1]) = 0, we have HomD(R) (P\u2022 , M [1]) = 0. Now it follows\nfrom Lemma 3.3 that\n\u2022\n\u2022\nHomD(R) (P\u2022 , H 0 (M )[1]) \u2243 HomD(R) (P\u2022 , M [1]) = 0.\n\u2022\n\nThis implies H 0 (M ) \u2208 X .\n\u2022\nNow, we first fix a chain map \u03c9M for the given M, and then define l(M) := H 0 (M )/t(M), where t(M)\n\u2022\ndenotes the trace of H 0 (P\u2022 ) in H 0 (M ), that is, the sum of the images of all homomorphisms from H 0 (P\u2022 ) to\n\u2022\nH 0 (M ). Thus l(M) \u2208 X since X is closed under quotients. By Lemma 3.3, we have HomD(R) (P\u2022 , H 0 (P\u2022 )[1])\n\u2243 HomD(R) (P\u2022 , P\u2022 [1]) = 0. This means H 0 (P\u2022 ) \u2208 X . Since H 0 commutes with coproducts, we infer from\nLemma 3.3 that coproducts of copies of H 0 (P\u2022 ) lie in X . This shows t(M) \u2208 X because it is an image of a\ncoproduct of H 0 (P\u2022 ).\nIn the following, we shall prove l(M) \u2208 P\u2022\u22a5 . Clearly, we have HomD(R) (P\u2022 , l(M)[i]) = 0 for i 6= 0,\nand HomD(R) (P\u2022 , l(M)) \u2243 HomR (H 0 (P\u2022 ), l(M)). So, in order to show l(M) \u2208 P\u2022\u22a5 , it is sufficient to prove\nHomR (H 0 (P\u2022 ), l(M)) = 0.\nOne the one hand, applying HomR (H 0 (P\u2022 ), \u2212) to the the canonical exacts sequence\n\u2022\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 t(M) \u2212\u2192 H 0 (M ) \u2212\u2192 l(M) \u2212\u2192 0\nR-modules, we can see that HomR (H 0 (P\u2022 ), l(M)) can be embedded into HomD(R) (H 0 (P\u2022 ),t(M)[1]) because\n\u2022\nHomR (H 0 (P\u2022 ),t(M)) \u2212\u2192 HomR (H 0 (P\u2022 ), H 0 (M )) is always bijective by definition. On the other hand,\napplying HomD(R) (\u2212,t(M)[1]) to the following canonical triangle induced from P\u2022\nH \u22121 (P\u2022 )[1] \u2212\u2192 P\u2022 \u2212\u2192 H 0 (P\u2022 ) \u2212\u2192 H \u22121 (P\u2022 )[2]\nin D(R) and using the fact that HomD(R) (H \u22121 (P\u2022 )[1],t(M)) = 0 and that t(M) \u2208 X , we can deduce that\nHomD(R) (H 0 (P\u2022 ),t(M)[1]) = 0. Consequently, HomR (H 0 (P\u2022 ), l(M)) = 0, as desired. Thus l(M) \u2208 P\u2022\u22a5 .\nWe define \u03b7M := \u03c6M \u03b3M \u03c0M : M \u2192 l(M), which is clearly a homomorphism of R-modules.\nSimilarly, for the module N, we fix, once and for all, a chain map \u03c9N : P\u2022(\u03b2) \u2192 N[1], and then define l(N)\nand \u03b7N : N \u2192 l(N), where \u03b2 is a cardinal. Clearly, we have the following triangle in D(R):\nN\n\n\u03c6N\n\n\u03c8N\n\n/ N\u2022\n\n/ P\u2022(\u03b2)\n\n\u03c9N\n\n/ N[1]\n\n\u2022\n\nwith N := cone(\u03c9N )[\u22121].\nStep (2). For any homomorphism g : M \u2192 N in R-Mod, we claim that there is a unique homomorphism\nl(g) : l(M) \u2192 l(N) such that the following diagram commutes:\n\u03b7M\n\nM\n\n/ l(M)\n\ng\n\nl(g)\n\u03b7N\n\n\u000f\n\nN\n\n\u000f\n\n/ l(N).\n\n\u2022\n\nIn fact, since HomD(R) (P\u2022 , N [1]) = 0 by Step (1), we know from homological algebra that HomD(R) (P\u2022(\u03b1) [\u22121],\n\u2022\n\u2022\nN ) \u2243 \u03a0\u03b1 HomD(R) (P\u2022 [\u22121], N) = 0. In particular, the homomorphism \u03c9M [\u22121]g\u03c6N : P\u2022(\u03b1) [\u22121] \u2192 N must\n\u2022\n\u2022\nbe zero. Consequently, there is a homomorphism g\u2032 : M \u2192 N such that g\u03c6N = \u03c6M g\u2032 . So, we have the\nfollowing commutative diagram\nP\u2022(\u03b1) [\u22121]\n\n\u2212\u03c9M [\u22121]\n\n/M\n\n\u03c6M\n\ng\n\nP(\u03b2) [\u22121]\n\n\u2212\u03c9N [\u22121]\n\n\u000f\n/N\n\n\u03c6N\n\n16\n\n/ M\u2022\n\u001f\n\u001f g\u2032\n\u001f\n\u000f\n/ N\u2022\n\n\u03c8M\n\n\u03c8N\n\n/\n\nP\u2022(\u03b1)\n\n/ P(\u03b2) .\n\n\f\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nNotice that such g\u2032 is not unique in general. Suppose that there exists another morphism h : M \u2192 N such\n\u2022\nthat g\u03c6N = \u03c6M h. Then g\u2032 \u2212 h = \u03c8M s for some morphism s : P\u2022(\u03b1) \u2192 N . Applying the 0-th cohomological\nfunctor H 0 (\u2212) : D(R) \u2192 R-Mod to this equality, we get\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nH 0 (g\u2032 ) \u2212 H 0(h) = H 0 (\u03c8M )H 0 (s) : H 0 (M ) \u2212\u2192 H 0 (N ),\n\u2022\n\nwhere H 0 (s) : H 0 (P\u2022(\u03b1) ) \u2192 H 0 (N ). Since the functor H 0 (\u2212) commutes with coproducts, we get H 0 (P\u2022(\u03b1) ) \u2243\nH 0 (P\u2022 )(\u03b1) . This means that the image of H 0 (g\u2032 ) \u2212 H 0 (h) is contained in t(N) by the definition of t(N). Thus\nH 0 (g\u2032 ) = H 0 (h) : l(M) \u2212\u2192 l(N),\nwhich shows that H 0 (g\u2032 ) depends on g and not on the choice of g\u2032 . Thus, given g : M \u2192 N, we can define\nl(g) := H 0 (g\u2032 ) : l(M) \u2192 l(N) which is a homomorphism in P\u2022\u22a5 . To prove the equality \u03b7M l(g) = g\u03b7N , we\n\u2022\n\u2022\nobserve that H 0 (g\u2032 ) is the unique homomorphism from H 0 (M ) to H 0 (N ) such that the following diagram\nis commutative:\n\u2022\n/ H \u22121 (M \u2022 )[2]\n/ M \u2022 \u03b3M / H 0 (M \u2022 )\nH \u22121 (M )[1]\ng\u2032\n\u2022\n\nH \u22121 (N )[1]\n\u2022\n\nH 0 (g\u2032 )\n\n\u000f\n\n/ N\u2022\n\n\u03b3N\n\n\u000f\n\n/ H 0 (N \u2022 )\n\n/ H \u22121 (N \u2022 )[2]\n\n\u2022\n\nbecause HomD(R) (H \u22121 (M )[2], H 0 (N )) = 0. Then\n\u03b7M l(g) = \u03c6M \u03b3M \u03c0M l(g) = \u03c6M \u03b3M H 0 (g\u2032 )\u03c0N = \u03c6M g\u2032 \u03b3N \u03c0N = g\u03c6N \u03b3N \u03c0N = g\u03b7N .\nHence, we have proved the existence of a homomorphism l(g) from l(M) to l(N) with the desired property.\nNow we show the uniqueness of l(g). Let t1 ,t2 : l(M) \u2192 l(N) be two homomorphisms such that \u03b7M ti =\ng\u03b7N for i = 1, 2. Set t := t1 \u2212 t2 . Then \u03b7M t = \u03c6M (\u03b3M \u03c0M t) = 0. It follows from the triangle (\u2217) that\nthere exists a morphism u : P\u2022(\u03b1) \u2192 l(N) in D(R) such that \u03b3M \u03c0M t = \u03c8M u. But HomD(R) (P\u2022 , l(N)) = 0\nsince l(N) \u2208 P\u2022\u22a5 . This shows u = 0 and \u03b3M \u03c0M t = 0. By the triangle (\u2217\u2217), we know \u03c0M t = 0 since\n\u2022\nHomD(R) (H \u22121 (M )[2], l(N)) = 0. Note that \u03c0M is surjective. Hence t = 0, that is, t1 = t2 . This finishes\nthe proof of the uniqueness.\nConsequently, if g is an isomorphism, then l(g) is an isomorphism. This shows also that, regardless of\ndifferent choices of \u03c9M , the module l(M) is unique up to isomorphism.\nStep (3). We define a functor l : R-Mod \u2192 P\u2022\u22a5 by sending M in R-Mod to l(M), and homomorphism\ng : M \u2192 N to l(g) : l(M) \u2192 l(N). By Step (2), l is well-defined. Clearly, we have l(Y ) \u2243 Y for any Y \u2208 P\u2022\u22a5\nby definition. Now, it follows from Step (2) that HomR (l(U ),V ) \u2243 HomR (U, j(V )) for any U \u2208 R-Mod and\nV \u2208 P\u2022\u22a5 . This isomorphism is natural in U and V . Thus (l, j) is an adjoint pair of functors. \u0003\nAs a consequence of Proposition 3.9, we obtain the following promised result which provides an effective\ndescription of R\u03a3 as endomorphism rings.\nCorollary 3.10. Let f : P\u22121 \u2192 P0 be a homomorphism between finitely generated projective R-modules\nand \u03a3 := { f }. If HomD(R) (P\u2022f , P\u2022f [1]) = 0, then the inclusion j : \u03a3\u22a5 \u2192 R-Mod admits a left adjoint l :\nR-Mod \u2192 \u03a3\u22a5 , which can be constructed explicitly. In particular, R\u03a3 is isomorphic to the endomorphism ring\nEndR (l(R)).\nProof. Since P\u2022f \u2208 C b (R-proj), we know that the functor HomD(R) (P\u2022f , \u2212) commutes with direct sums.\nConsequently, if HomD(R) (P\u2022f , P\u2022f [1]) = 0, then HomD(R) (P\u2022f , P\u2022f (\u03b4) [1]) = 0 for any cardinal \u03b4. Thus the existence of the functor l in Corollary 3.10 follows immediately from Proposition 3.9.\nIn the following, we shall prove that R\u03a3 is isomorphic to the endomorphism ring EndR (l(R)). Indeed,\nby Proposition 3.2(1), we know that \u03a3\u22a5 is closed under extensions, kernels, cokernels, arbitrary direct sums\n17\n\n\fand products. Further, since the inclusion j admits a left adjoint functor l, the full subcategory \u03a3\u22a5 of R-Mod\nsatisfies all assumptions of [23, Proposition 3.8]. Define S := EndR (l(R)). Then it follows directly from [23,\nProposition 3.8] that l(R) is a projective generator for \u03a3\u22a5 , and there exists a ring epimorphism \u03c1: R \u2192 S such\nthat the following diagram\n\u03a3O \u22a5 o\n\nj\n\n/\n\nR-Mod\nqqqq8\nq\nq\nF G \u03c1\u2217 qqqqqq\nq\n\u000f qqqqqqqq \u03c1\u2217\nq\nx\nS-Mod\nl\n\ncommutes, where F := R l(R) \u2297S \u2212 and G := HomR (l(R), \u2212) are mutually inverse functors, and where\n\u03c1\u2217 := R S \u2297S \u2212 is the canonical embedding, and \u03c1\u2217 := S S \u2297R \u2212 is a left adjoint of \u03c1\u2217 . Since the both ring\nepimorphisms \u03bb : R \u2192 R\u03a3 and \u03c1: R \u2192 S give rise to the same bireflective subcategory \u03a3\u22a5 of R-Mod, we\nconclude from Lemma 2.1 that R\u03a3 is isomorphic to S. \u0003\nFinally, we remark that, in general, the two-term complex P\u2022 in Proposition 3.9 cannot be replaced by a\ncomplex in C (R-Proj) with more than two terms. A counterexample is the following:\nLet A be the algebra given by the following quiver with relations:\n\u03b2\n\n3\n\n~\n\u03b3\n\n=2\n\n\u03b1\n\n/ 1,\n\n\u03b2\u03b3 = \u03b3\u03b1 = 0.\n\nWe denote by Si , Ii and Pi the simple, injective and projective modules corresponding to the vertex i, respectively. Let P\u2022 be the minimal projective resolution of S3 . Then P\u2022 is a three-term complex. We can\neasily check that P\u2022\u22a5 has only two indecomposable modules, they are the indecomposable modules I1\nand I2 . Note that A is representation-finite and every indecomposable module is finitely generated. Also,\nwe have ExtiA (S3 , S3 ) = 0 for i = 1, 2. Actually, this is true for all i > 0. Since P\u2022 is compact, one has\nHomD(A) (P\u2022 , P\u2022(\u03b1) [1]) = 0 for all cardinal \u03b1. If the inclusion functor j from P\u2022\u22a5 into A-Mod would have\na left adjoint, then j would preserve injective homomorphisms. One can verify that there is a non-zero homomorphism from I1 to I2 which is a monomorphism in P\u2022\u22a5 , but not a monomorphism in A-Mod. This is a\ncontradiction and shows that the inclusion functor from P\u2022\u22a5 into A-Mod cannot possess a left adjoint.\nNote that the simple module corresponding to the vertex 1 is of injective dimension 3, and defines a\n2-APR-tilting module S3 \u2295 P2 \u2295 P3 (see [26] for unexplained definitions).\n\n4 Recollements of derived categories and infinitely generated tilting modules\nIn this section, we shall use our results in Section 3 to show the first statement of the main result, Theorem\n1.1. More precisely, we first recall the definition of infinitely generated tilting modules, and then discuss\nsome of their homological properties. Especially, we shall establish a crucial result, Proposition 4.6, which\nwill play a role in our proof of the main result.\nLet A be a ring with identity.\nDefinition 4.1. [19] An A-module T is called a tilting module (of projective dimension at most one) if the\nfollowing conditions are satisfied:\n(T 1) the projective dimension of T is at most 1, that is, there exists a projective resolution of T : 0 \u2192\nP1 \u2192 P0 \u2192 T \u2192 0, where Pi is projective for i = 0, 1.\n(T 2) ExtiA (T, T (\u03b1) ) = 0 for each i \u2265 1 and every cardinal \u03b1; where T (\u03b1) stands for the direct sum of \u03b1\ncopies of T ; and\n18\n\n\f(T 3) there exists an exact sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 A A \u2212\u2192 T0 \u2212\u2192 T1 \u2212\u2192 0\nof A-modules such that Ti \u2208 Add(T ) for i = 0, 1.\nIf P1 and P0 in the condition (T1 ) are finitely generated, then the tilting module T is called a classical\ntilting module (see [15] and [25]).\nTwo tilting A-modules T and T \u2032 are said to be equivalent if Add(T ) = Add(T \u2032 ), or equivalently, Gen(T ) =\nGen(T \u2032 ), where Gen(T ) denotes the full subcategory of A-Mod generated by T . Recall that an A-module M\nis generated by T if there is an index set I and a surjective homomorphism f : T (I) \u2192 M.\nAn A-module T is said to be good if it satisfies (1), (2) and\n(T 3)\u2032 there is an exact sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 A A \u2212\u2192 T0 \u2212\u2192 T1 \u2212\u2192 0\nin A-Mod such that Ti \u2208 add(T ) for i = 0, 1.\nNote that each classical tilting module is good. Moreover, for any given tilting module A T with (T1) and\n(T2), the module T \u2032 := T0 \u2295 T1 is a good tilting module which is equivalent to the given one.\nFrom now on, we assume in this section that T is a good tilting A-module, namely, it satisfies (T1 ), (T2 )\nand\n(T3 )\u2032 :\n\n\u03c6\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 A \u2212\u2192 T0 \u2212\u2192 T1 \u2212\u2192 0\n\nwith \u03c6 a homomorphism of A-modules between Ti \u2208 add(T ). Let B := EndA (T ). We define\nT \u22a5 := {X \u2208 A-Mod | ExtiA (T, X ) = 0 for all i \u2265 1}, E := {Y \u2208 B-Mod | TorBi (T,Y ) = 0 for all i \u2265 0};\nG := A T \u2297LB \u2212 : D(B) \u2212\u2192 D(A),\n\nH := RHom A (T, \u2212) : D(A) \u2212\u2192 D(B);\n\nY := Ker(G),\nQ\u2022 :=\n\nZ := Im(H),\n\n\u03c6\u2217\n\n* * * \u2212\u2192 0 \u2212\u2192 HomA (T, T0 ) \u2212\u2192 HomA (T, T1 ) \u2212\u2192 0 \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2208 C b (B-proj),\n\nwhere \u03c6\u2217 := HomA (T, \u03c6), and where the finitely generated projective B-modules HomA (T, T0 ) and HomA (T, T1 ),\nas terms of the complex Q\u2022 , are concentrated on the degrees 0 and 1, respectively. Clearly, H(A) = Q\u2022 in\nD(A).\nIn the next lemma we mention a few basic properties of tilting modules. For proofs we refer to [10,\nProposition 1.4, Lemma 1.5] and [8].\nLemma 4.2. Let T be a tilting A-module. Then:\n(1) TB has a projective resolution\n0 \u2212\u2192 Q1 \u2212\u2192 Q0 \u2212\u2192 TB \u2212\u2192 0\nsuch that Qi \u2208 add(BB ) for each 0 \u2264 i \u2264 1.\nop\n(2) EndBop (T ) \u2243 A and ExtiB (T, T ) = 0 for all i \u2265 1.\n(3) For each Y \u2208 Add(B B), we have ExtiA (T, A T \u2297B Y ) = 0(for each i \u2265 1.\nX , i = 0,\n(4) For each X \u2208 T \u22a5 , we have TorBi (A TB , HomA (T, X )) \u2243\n0, i > 0.\n\u22a5\n(5) T is closed under direct sums.\n\n19\n\n\fThe following result is shown in [8, Theorem 5.1], which says that the unbounded derived category of\nB-Mod is bigger than that of A-Mod in general.\nLemma 4.3. The functor H is fully faithful, and the functor G induces a triangle equivalence between\nD(B)/Ker(G) and D(A). Here we denote by D(B)/Ker(G) the Verdier quotient of D(B) by the category\nKer(G).\nThe following lemma supplies a method to obtain modules in E , and is also useful for our later calculations.\nLemma 4.4. Suppose that I is a cardinal and Xi \u2208 T \u22a5 for each i \u2208 I. Consider the canonical exact sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192\n\nM\n\n\u03b4\n\nI\nHomA (T, Xi ) \u2212\u2192\nHomA (T,\n\ni\u2208I\n\nM\n\nX j ) \u2212\u2192 coker(\u03b4I ) \u2212\u2192 0\n\nj\u2208I\n\nL\n\nin B-Mod, where \u03b4I is defined by ( fi )i\u2208I 7\u2192 \u2211i\u2208I fi \u03bbi with fi \u2208 HomA (T, Xi) and \u03bbi : Xi \u2192 j\u2208I X j the canonical\ninclusion for each i \u2208 I. Then coker(\u03b4I ) \u2208 E . Particularly, for each projective B-module P, the unit adjunction\nmorphism \u03b7\u2032P : P \u2192 HomA (T, T \u2297B P) is injective with coker(\u03b7\u2032P ) \u2208 E .\nProof. Note that \u03b4I is well-defined. By the definition of \u03b4I , we can see easily that \u03b4I is injective. So, there\nis a canonical exact sequence\n(\u2217)\n\n0 \u2212\u2192\n\nM\n\n\u03b4\n\nI\nHomA (T, Xi ) \u2212\u2192\nHomA (T,\n\ni\u2208I\n\nM\n\nX j ) \u2212\u2192 coker(\u03b4I ) \u2212\u2192 0.\n\nj\u2208I\n\nL\n\nSince T \u22a5 is closed under direct sums by Lemma 4.2(5), we have j\u2208I X j \u2208 T \u22a5 . It then follows from Lemma\n4.2(4) that\n\uf8f1M\nX j , m = 0,\n\uf8f2\nM\nTorBm (T, HomA (T,\nX j )) \u2243 j\u2208I\n\uf8f3\nj\u2208I\n0,\nm > 0.\n\nSimilarly, for any i \u2208 I, we have\n\n(\nXi , n = 0,\nTorBn (T, HomA (T, Xi)) \u2243\n0, n > 0.\nSince the right module TB has projective dimension at most 1, we see that TortB (T, coker(\u03b4I )) = 0 for any\nt > 1. By applying the functor A T \u2297B \u2212 : B-Mod \u2192 A-Mod to the sequence (\u2217), we can easily form the\nfollowing exact commutative diagram:\n0\n\n/ TorB (T, coker(\u03b4 ))\nI\n1\n\n/ T \u2297B (L HomA (T, Xi ))\ni\u2208I\n\n/ T \u2297B HomA (T,\n\n\u2243\n\nL\n\nj\u2208I X j )\n\n\u2243\n\nL \u000f\n\nL \u000f\n\nj\u2208I X j .\n\ni\u2208I Xi\n\nThis implies T \u2297B coker(\u03b4I ) = 0 = TorB1 (T, coker(\u03b4I )). Hence coker(\u03b4I ) \u2208 E .\nTo prove the last statement of Lemma 4.4, we note that the unit adjunction\n\u03b7\u2032 : 1B-Mod \u2212\u2192 HomA (T, T \u2297B \u2212)\n\n20\n\n/ T \u2297B coker(\u03b4I )\n\n/0\n\n\fis a natural transformation of functors from B-Mod to itself, and that E is closed under direct summands.\nThus, it is sufficient to show that the statement holds for free B-modules. Let \u03b1 be any cardinal. Then we\nmay form the following exact commutative diagram:\nB(\u03b1)\n\n\u03b7\u2032 (\u03b1)\nB\n\n/ Hom (T, T \u2297 B(\u03b1) )\nA\nB\n\u2243\n\n0\n\n/ Hom (T, T )(\u03b1)\nA\n\n\u03b4\u03b1\n\n\u000f\n\n/ Hom (T, T (\u03b1) )\nA\n\n/ coker(\u03b4\u03b1 )\n\n/ 0.\n\nSince \u03b4\u03b1 is injective, we conclude that \u03b7\u2032B(\u03b1) also is injective, and therefore coker(\u03b7\u2032B(\u03b1) ) \u2243 coker(\u03b4\u03b1 ) \u2208 E .\nThis finishes the whole proof. \u0003\nIn the next lemma we give a description of the category E .\nLemma 4.5. The following statements hold.\n(1) E = {X \u2208 B-Mod | HomD(B) (Q\u2022 , X [i]) = 0 for all i \u2208 Z}. In particular, E is closed under direct sums\nand products.\n(2) E of B-Mod is closed under isomorphic images, extensions, kernels and cokernels. In particular, E\nis an abelian subcategory of B-Mod.\nProof. (1) Let X be a B-module and i be an integer. Then\nHomD(B) (Q\u2022 , X [i]) \u2243 HomK (B) (Q\u2022 , X [i]) \u2243 H i (HomB (Q\u2022 , X )) \u2243 H i(HomB (Q\u2022 , B) \u2297B X ),\nwhere the last isomorphism follows from the fact that the restriction of the natural transformation HomB (\u2212, B)\u2297B\nX \u2192 HomB (\u2212, X ) to C (B-proj) is a natural isomorphism. By the definition of Q\u2022 , we know that HomB (Q\u2022 , B)\nis the complex:\n\u03c6\u2217\n* * * \u2212\u2192 0 \u2212\u2192 HomA (T1 , T ) \u2212\u2192 HomA (T0 , T ) \u2212\u2192 0 \u2212\u2192 * * *\nin C b (B -proj), where \u03c6\u2217 := HomA (\u03c6, T ), and where the finitely generated projective B -modules HomA (T1 , T )\nand HomA (T0 , T ) are of degrees \u22121 and 0, respectively. Note that the conditions (T2 ) and (T3 ) in Definition\n4.1 imply that the sequence\nop\n\nop\n\n\u03c6\u2217\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 HomA (T1 , T ) \u2212\u2192 HomA (T0 , T ) \u2212\u2192 T \u2212\u2192 0\nis exact. In other words, the complex HomB (Q\u2022 , B B) is quasi-isomorphic to TB (here we use the fact that the\nfunctor HomA (\u2212, T ) : add(A T ) \u2192 add(BB ) is an equivalence of categories). It follows from the definition of\nTorBi that\n\u001a\n\u0001\n0\nif i > 0,\ni\n\u2022\nH HomB (Q , B) \u2297B X \u2243\nTorB\u2212i (T, X ) if i \u2264 0.\n\nThis means that HomD(B) (Q\u2022 , X [i]) = 0 if and only if TorB\u2212i (T, X ) = 0. Hence\n\nE = {X \u2208 B-Mod | HomD(B) (Q\u2022 , X [i]) = 0 for all i \u2208 Z}.\nConsequently, E is closed under direct products. Further, since Q\u2022 is a bounded complex of finitely generated\nprojective B-modules, we know that E is closed under direct sums, too.\n(2) This statement follows directly from Proposition 3.2(1). \u0003\nThe following proposition is crucial to the proof of Theorem 1.1(1).\n\n21\n\n\f\u0001\nProposition 4.6. The triple Tria(Q\u2022 ), Ker(G), Im(H) is a TTF tripe in D(B). Moreover,\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nKer(G) = {Y \u2208 D(B) | Y \u2243 Y \u2022 in D(B) with Y i \u2208 E for all i \u2208 Z};\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nIm(H) = {Z \u2208 D(B) | Z \u2243 Z \u2022 in D(B) with Z i \u2208 HomA (T, Add(T )) for all i \u2208 Z},\nwhere HomA (T, Add(T )) stands for the full subcategory of B-Mod consisting of all the modules HomA (T, T \u2032 )\nwith T \u2032 in Add(T ).\nProof. Recall that we have denoted Ker(G) by Y , and Im(H) by Z . The whole proof of this proposition\nwill be divided into three steps.\nStep (1). We prove that the pair (Y , Z ) is a torsion pair in D(B). In fact, for any Y \u2022 \u2208 Y and W \u2022 \u2208 D(A),\nwe have HomD(B) (Y \u2022 , H(W \u2022 )) \u2243 HomD(A) (G(Y \u2022 ),W \u2022 ) = HomD(A) (0,W \u2022 ) = 0 because the pair (G, H) is an\nadjoint pair of triangle functors by Lemma 4.3. This shows HomD(B) (Y , Z ) = 0. Let \u03b7 : IdD(B) \u2192 HG be\nthe unit adjunction, and let \u03b5 : GH \u2192 IdD(A) be the counit adjunction. By Lemma 4.3, we know that \u03b5 is\ninvertible. For any M \u2022 in D(B), the canonical morphism \u03b7M\u2022 : M \u2022 \u2192 HG(M \u2022 ) can be extended to a triangle\nin D(B):\n\u03b7M\u2022\nM \u2022 \u2212\u2212\n\u2192 HG(M \u2022) \u2212\u2192 N \u2022 \u2212\u2192 M \u2022 [1].\nBy applying the functor G to the above triangle, we obtain a triangle in D(A):\nG(\u03b7M\u2022 )\n\nG(M \u2022 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 GHG(M \u2022) \u2212\u2192 G(N \u2022 ) \u2212\u2192 G(M \u2022 )[1].\nSince \u03b5 is invertible, we see that G(\u03b7M\u2022 ) is an isomorphism. This shows G(N \u2022 ) = 0, that is, N \u2022 \u2208 Y . Since\nY is a triangulated subcategory of D(B), we have N \u2022[\u22121] \u2208 Y . Thus the following triangle\n\u03b7\n\n\u2022\n\nM\nN \u2022 [\u22121] \u2212\u2192 M \u2022 \u2212\u2212\n\u2192 HG(M \u2022) \u2212\u2192 N \u2022\n\n(\u2217)\n\nin D(B) with HG(M \u2022 ) \u2208 Z shows that the third condition of Definition 2.5 is satisfied. Hence the pair\n(Y , Z ) is a torsion pair in D(B) by Definition 2.5. Since Y is a triangulated category, the torsion pair (Y , Z )\nis hereditary.\nStep (2). We calculate the categories Y and Z . Before starting our calculations, we mention the following\nresult in [39, Theorem 10.5.9, Corollary 10.5.11]:\n\u2022\n\u2022\nFor every complex X \u2022 in D(B), there exists a quasi-isomorphism X \u2192 X \u2022 with X a complex of (A T \u2297B\n\u2022\n\u2212)-acyclic B-modules such that G(X \u2022 ) \u2243 T \u2297B X . Here, a B-module N is said to be (A T \u2297B \u2212)-acyclic if\nTorBi (T, N) = 0 for any i > 0. Thus the action of the left derived functor G on any complex U \u2022 of (A T \u2297B \u2212)acyclic B-modules is the same as that of the functor A T \u2297B \u2212 which acts in component wise on each term of\nU \u2022.\nA similar statement holds for the right derived functor H.\nNow let us first interpret the triangle (\u2217) in terms of objects in C (B-Proj). For the complex M \u2022 , we choose\nP\u2022 \u2208 C (B-Proj) such that P\u2022 is quasi-isomorphic to the complex M \u2022 . Then G(M \u2022 ) \u2243 T \u2297B P\u2022 . By Lemma\n4.2(3), we have HG(M \u2022 ) = HomA (T, T \u2297B P\u2022 ) because the A-module T \u2297B P is HomA (T, \u2212)-acyclic for any\nprojective B-module P. Note that the homomorphism \u03b7P\u2022 coincides with (\u03b7\u2032Pn )n\u2208Z , where Pn is the n-th term\nof the complex P\u2022 and \u03b7\u2032Pn : Pn \u2192 HomA (T, T \u2297B Pn ) is the unit adjunction morphism for each n \u2208 Z. By\nLemma 4.4, there is a short exact sequence of complexes\n\u03b7\n\n\u2022\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 P\u2022 \u2212\u2212P\u2192 HomA (T, T \u2297B P\u2022 ) \u2212\u2192 coker(\u03b7P\u2022 ) \u2212\u2192 0\n\n22\n\n\fsuch that (coker(\u03b7P\u2022 ))i = coker(\u03b7\u2032Pi ) \u2208 E for each i \u2208 Z. Thus, we can form the following commutative\ndiagram of triangles in D(B):\ncoker(\u03b7P\u2022 )[\u22121]\n\u001f\n\u001f\n\n/ P\u2022\n\n\u2243\n\n\u001f\n\u000f\n\nN \u2022 [\u22121]\n\n\u03b7P\u2022\n\n/ HomA (T, T \u2297B P\u2022 )\n\n\u2243\n\n\u000f\n\n/ M\u2022\n\n\u03b7M\u2022\n\n/ RHom A (T, T \u2297L M \u2022 )\nB\n\n/ coker(\u03b7P\u2022 )\n\u001f\n\u001f\u2243\n\u001f\u000f\n/ N \u2022.\n\nOn the one hand, if M \u2022 \u2208 Y , then T \u2297LB M \u2022 = 0 by definition, and so M \u2022 \u2243 coker(\u03b7P\u2022 )[\u22121] in D(B). On the\nother hand, if M \u2022 \u2243 Y \u2022 in D(B) for some complex Y \u2022 with Y i \u2208 E for each i \u2208 Z, then T \u2297LB M \u2022 \u2243 T \u2297LB Y \u2022 =\nT \u2297B Y \u2022 = 0 by the above mentioned fact. This means M \u2022 \u2208 Y . Hence the first equality in Proposition 4.6\nholds.\nTo prove the second equality, we observe that, by Lemma 4.2(4), HomA (T, T \u2297B HomA (T, T \u2032 )) \u2243 HomA (T, T \u2032 )\nfor any T \u2032 \u2208 Add(T ). Let Z \u2022 be a complex in D(B) such that Z i \u2208 HomA (T, Add(T )). Then HG(Z \u2022 ) \u2243\nHomA (T, T \u2297B Z \u2022 ) \u2243 Z \u2022 in D(B) because every B-module in HomA (T, Add(T )) is (T \u2297B \u2212)-acyclic by\nLemma 4.2(3) and Lemma 4.2(4). This implies Z \u2022 \u2208 Z . Conversely, for any W \u2022 \u2208 D(A), we can choose\na complex L\u2022 \u2208 C (B-Proj) such that L\u2022 is quasi-isomorphic to H(W \u2022 ). By Lemma 4.3, we conclude that\nH(W \u2022 ) \u2243 HG(H(W \u2022 )) \u2243 HG(L\u2022 ) in D(B). Since HG(L\u2022 ) = H(T \u2297LB L\u2022 ) = H(T \u2297B L\u2022 ) \u2243 HomA (T, T \u2297B\nL\u2022 ), where the last isomrphism follows from Lemma 4.2(3) and the above mentioned fact about the functor\nH. Clearly, the complex HomA (T, T \u2297B L\u2022 ) has each term in HomA (T, Add(T )). Thus the second equality in\nProposition 4.6 holds.\nStep (3). We claim that there is a full subcategory category X of D(B) such that (X , Y , Z ) is a TTF\ntriple in D(B). Furthermore, we have X = Tria(Q\u2022 ).\nIndeed, since E is closed under direct sums and products by Lemma 4.5, we conclude that Y is closed\nunder all small coproducts and products. Then the existence of the TTF triple (X , Y , Z ) in D(B) follows\nstraightforward from Lemma 2.10. Moreover, X = Ker(HomD(B) (\u2212, Y )) and Y = Ker(HomD(B) (X , \u2212)).\nNow we shall prove X = Tria(Q\u2022 ). First, we show Q\u2022 \u2208 X . This is equivalent to verifying HomD(B) (Q\u2022 , Y )\n= 0. Let Y \u2032 := Ker(HomD(B) (Tria(Q\u2022 ), \u2212)). By Lemma 2.11, we see that (Tria(Q\u2022 ), Y \u2032 ) is a torsion pair in\nD(B) with\nY \u2032 = {Y \u2022 \u2208 D(B) | HomD(B) (Q\u2022 ,Y \u2022 [i]) = 0 for all i \u2208 Z}.\nRecall that \u03c6\u2217 := HomA (T, \u03c6) : HomA (T, T0 ) \u2192 HomA (T, T1 ) is a homomorphism between finitely generated\nprojective B-modules. We define \u03a3 := {\u03c6\u2217 }. Then \u03a3\u2022 = {Q\u2022 [1]} (see notations in Section 3). By Lemma 4.5\n(1), we have \u03a3\u22a5 = E . Thus it follows from Proposition 3.2 that\n\nY \u2032 = D(B)E := {Y \u2022 \u2208 D(B) | H i (Y \u2022 ) \u2208 E for all i \u2208 Z}.\nAccording to Lemma 4.5 (2), E is an abelian subcategory of B-Mod. This forces Y \u2286 Y \u2032 . In particular, we\nhave HomD(B) (Q\u2022 , Y ) = 0, which yields Q\u2022 \u2208 X . Therefore, Tria(Q\u2022 ) \u2286 X since X is a full triangulated\nsubcategory of D(B).\nLet i : X \u2192 D(B) and k : Z \u2192 D(B) be the canonical inclusions. Then the functor i has a right adjoint\nfunctor R : D(B) \u2192 X . Since (X , Y , Z ) is a TTF triple in D(B), the functor Rk : Z \u2192 X is an equivalence\n(see the statements after Definition 2.6 in Subsection 2.3). So the composition functor RkH : D(A) \u2192 X is\nan equivalence because H : D(A) \u2192 Z is an equivalence. Since a functor possessing a right adjoint functor\npreserves coproducts, we know that the functor RkH commutes with coproducts. Note that D(A) admits all\nsmall coproducts and that the notion of coproducts depends on the category where coproducts are taken. In\ngeneral, Z is not closed under coproducts.\nSince (i, R) is an adjoint pair, we know that the functor i preserves coproducts. This means that a coproduct in X is the same as that in D(B).\n23\n\n\fSince H(A) \u2243 Q\u2022 \u2208 X , we have RkH(A) \u2243 R(Q\u2022 ) = Q\u2022 . Note that D(A) = Tria(A) and that the triangle functor RkH : D(A) \u2192 X is an equivalence under which Tria(A) has the image Tria(Q\u2022 ) since the functor\u0001\nRkH commutes with coproducts. It follows that X = Tria(Q\u2022 ) and Y = Y \u2032 . Hence Tria(Q\u2022 ), Ker(G), Im(H)\nis a TTF tripe in D(B). \u0003\nWith the above preparations, now we prove Theorem 1.1 (1).\nProof of Theorem 1.1 (1). By Proposition 4.6, we know that the triple ( Tria(Q\u2022 ), Ker(G), Im(H) ) is\na TTF tripe in D(B). Moreover, D(A) and Tria(Q\u2022 ) are equivalent as triangulated categories. According\nto the correspondence between recollements and TTF triples in Lemma 2.7(2), we can form the following\nrecollement\nL\n\nx\n\nx\n/ D(B)\nf\n\nj\n\nKer(G)\nf\n\n/ D(A) ,\n\nwhere j is the canonical embedding and L is the left adjoint of j. Recall that \u03c6\u2217 := HomA (T, \u03c6) is the\nhomomorphism between the finitely generated projective B-modules HomA (T, T0 ) and HomA (T, T1 ). As in\nSection 3, we define \u03a3 := {\u03c6\u2217 }. By Lemma 4.5(1), we have \u03a3\u22a5 = E . By Step (3) in the proof of Proposition\n4.6, we have Ker(G) = D(B)\u03a3\u22a5 . Let \u03bb : B \u2192 B\u03a3 be the universal localization of B at \u03a3. Since L is a functor\nfrom D(B) to Ker(G), we have L(B) \u2208 Ker(G), and therefore the condition (5) of Proposition 3.5 is satisfied\n\u223c\nby L(B), according to Proposition 4.6. Thus, by Proposition 3.5, we know that \u03bb\u2217 : D(B\u03a3 ) \u2212\n\u2192 D(B)\u03a3\u22a5 is\nan equivalence of triangulated categories, and that the homomorphism \u03bb is a homological ring epimorphism.\nSet C := B\u03a3 . Then Ker(G) and D(C) are equivalent as triangulated categories. Consequently, we can get the\nfollowing recollement from the above one:\nx\n\nx\n/ D(B)\nf\n\nD(C)\nf\n\n/ D(A) .\n\nIn the following, we shall explicitly describe the six triangle functors arising in the above recollement.\nHere, we follow the notations used in Definition 2.4, and take D = D(B), D \u2032 = D(A) and D \u2032\u2032 = D(C).\nThen it is not hard to see that i\u2217 = C \u2297LB \u2212, i\u2217 = \u03bb\u2217 and i! = RHom B (C, \u2212). As for the other three functors, we\nclaim that j! = iRkH, j! = G and j\u2217 = H up to natural ismorphisms. Let U : D(B) \u2192 Z be a left adjoint of\nthe inclusion k : Z \u2192 D(B). By Lemma 2.7 and the proof of Proposition 4.6, we get the following diagram\nx\n\nD(B)\n\ni\nR\n\nf\n\n/\n\nXo\n\nRkH\n\nD(A)\n\nkUi\n\nwith the properties:\n(i) (i, R) and (R, kUi) are adjoint pairs,\n(ii) RkH is an equivalence of triangulated categories.\nThis implies that j! = iRkH and j\u2217 = (kUi)(RkH). Note that the composition functor UiRk : Z \u2192 Z of the\nfunctor Ui and Rk is natural isomorphic to the identity functor 1Z by the property (3) of a TTF triple (see\nSubsection 2.3). Consequently, we can choose j\u2217 = H. Since (G, H) is an adjoint pair of functors, we can\nchoose j\u2217 = G. Thus the proof of the first part of Theorem 1.1 is completed. \u0003\nRemarks. (1) In the proof of Theorem 1.1(1), we have \u03a3 = {\u03c6\u2217 }, \u03a3\u22a5 = E and HomD(B) (Q\u2022 , Q\u2022 [1]) =\n0. This means that the homomorphism \u03c6\u2217 satisfies the assumptions in Corollary 3.10. Therefore we can\nexplicitly construct a left adjoint functor l : B-Mod \u2192 E of the inclusion j : E \u2192 B-Mod. In particular, we\nknow that C is isomorphic to the endomorphism ring EndB (l(B)) of l(B).\n24\n\n\f(2) The ring C equals zero if and only if T is a classical tilting module. In fact, C = 0 if and only if\nKer(G) = 0 if and only if G is an equivalence if and only if T is classical.\n(3) From the proof of Theorem 1.1(1), we know that a good tilting module T has the property: the functor\nG admits a fully faithful left adjoint j! . In the next section, we shall show that this property guarantees that\nthe tilting module T is good.\n\n5 Existence of recollements implies goodness of tilting modules\nIn this section, we shall prove the second part of Theorem 1.1, which is a converse of the first part in some\nsense. Our proof depends on the property that the total left derived functor G admits a fully faithful left\nadjoint j! .\nProof of Theorem 1.1 (2).\nLet T be a tilting A-module and B the endomorphism algebra of T . Recall that G and H stand for the\ntriangle functors T \u2297LB \u2212 : D(B) \u2192 D(A) and RHom A (T, \u2212) : D(A) \u2192 D(B), respectively. Suppose that G\nadmits a fully faithful left adjoint j! : D(A) \u2192 D(B). We want to show that T is a good tilting module.\nTo prove that T is good, it suffices to find a short exact sequence of A-modules,\n0 \u2212\u2192 A \u2212\u2192 T0 \u2212\u2192 T1 \u2212\u2192 0,\nsuch that Ti \u2208 add(T ) for i = 0, 1.\nFirst, we observe some consequences of the assumption that j! is fully faithful. Set W \u2022 := j! (A). Since\nthe total left derived functor G commutes with coproducts, we can easily show that the functor j! preserves\ncompact objects. In particular, the complex W \u2022 is compact in D(B), which implies W \u2022 \u2243 Q\u2022 in D(B) for\nsome Q\u2022 \u2208 C b (B-proj). Since the Hom-functor HomA (T, \u2212) induces an equivalence between add(T ) and\nB-proj, we can assume that Q\u2022 = HomA (T, X \u2022 ), where X \u2022 \u2208 C b (add(T )) is of the following form\ndi\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 X s \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2212\u2192 X i \u2212\u2192 X i+1 \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2212\u2192 X t \u2212\u2192 0\nfor s \u2264 0 \u2264 t. Since the functor j! is fully faithful, we conclude from [28, Chapter IV, Section 3, Theorem 1,\ne : IdD(A) \u2192 G j! is invertible. Thus A \u2243 G(W \u2022 ) \u2243 G(Q\u2022 ) in D(A).\np.90] that the unit adjunction morphism \u03b7\n\u2022\n\u2022\nNote that T \u2297B HomA (T, X ) \u2243 X in C b (A-proj) since X i \u2208 add(T ) for each s \u2264 i \u2264 t. Consequently, we\nhave A \u2243 X \u2022 in D(A). It follows that H 0 (X \u2022 ) \u2243 A and H i (X \u2022 ) = 0 for any i 6= 0.\nSecond, if t = 0, then the homomorphism X 0 \u2192 H 0 (X \u2022 ) splits, this implies A \u2208 add(T ). Hence T is a\ngood tilting module. Now we assume t 6= 0. Then we can decompose X \u2022 into two long exact sequence of\nA-modules:\nds\nd \u22121\n\u03c0\n0 \u2212\u2192 X s \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2212\u2192 X \u22121 \u2212\u2192 X 0 \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 0,\nd1\n\n\u03bc\n\ndt\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 A \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 X 1 \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2212\u2192 X t \u2212\u2192 0;\nwhere d 0 = \u03c0\u03bc and M is the image of d 0 . We claim Im(\u03bc) \u2208 add(T ). In fact, we have a long exact sequence\n\u03bd\n\nd1\n\ndt\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 Im(\u03bc) \u2212\u2192 X 1 \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2212\u2192 X t \u2212\u2192 0,\nwhere \u03bd is the canonical inclusion. For each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 t, since X i \u2208 add(T ), we have Im(d i ) \u2208 Gen(T ). As we\nknow, T \u22a5 = Gen(T ) for a tilting module T . Consequently, we see that Ext1A (T, Im(d i )) = 0 for any 1 \u2264 i \u2264 t.\nNote that Im(dt ) = X t \u2208 add(T ). Thus we can easily show Im(\u03bc) \u2208 add(T ) by induction on t.\nFinally, we shall prove M \u2208 add(T ). If s = 0, then M = X 0 \u2208 add(T ). Suppose s < 0. Since Im(\u03bc) \u2208\nadd(T ) and the sequence 0 \u2192 A \u2192 M \u2192 Im(\u03bc) \u2192 0 is exact, we know that Ext1A (M, T ) = 0 and M has projective dimension at most 1. In addition, Im(d \u22121 ) is a quotient module of X \u22121 . It follows that Ext1A (M, Im(d \u22121 )) =\n0, which implies that the homomorphism \u03c0 splits. Thus M \u2208 add(X 0 ) \u2286 add(T ).\n25\n\n\f\u03bc\n\nNow we define T0 = M and T1 = Im(\u03bc). Then the sequence 0 \u2192 A \u2192 T0 \u2212\u2192 T1 \u2192 0 satisfies Ti \u2208 add(T )\nfor i = 0, 1. Thus T is a good tilting module, and the proof is completed. \u0003\nRemark. Suppose that G admits a \u0001fully faithful left adjoint j! : D(A) \u2192 D(B). Then there exists a\nTTF triple j! (D(A)), Ker(G), H(D(A)) in D(B) (see [13, Chapter I, Proposition 2.11] for details), where\nj! (D(A)) and H(D(A)) denote the images of j! and H, respectively. By Lemma 2.7, we know that the\nderived category D(B) is a recollement of the derived category D(A) and Ker(G). Since T is good by\nTheorem 1.1(2), it follows from Theorem 1.1(1) that Ker(G) is triangle equivalent to the derived category\nD(C) of a ring C. Thus we get a recollement of derived module categories as in Theorem 1.1(1).\n\n6 Applications to tilting modules arising from ring epimorphisms\nIn this section we apply our main result Theorem 1.1 to tilting modules arising from ring epimorphisms. In\nthis case we shall describe the universal localization rings appearing in the main result by coproducts defined\nby Cohn in [17]. In fact, our discussion in this section will be implemented in the general setup of injective\nhomological ring epimorphisms between arbitrary rings, which is weaker than conditions of being tilting\nmodules.\nWe start with recalling of some definitions.\nLet R0 be a ring with identity. An R0 -ring is a ring R together with a ring homomorphism \u03bbR : R0 \u2192 R.\nAn R0 -homomorphism from an R0 -ring R to another R0 -ring S is a ring homomorphism f : R \u2192 S such that\n\u03bbS = \u03bbR f . If R0 is commutative and the image of \u03bbR : R0 \u2192 R is contained in the center Z(R) of R, then we\nsay that R is an R0 -algebra.\nRecall that the coproduct of a family {Ri | i \u2208 I} of R0 -rings with I an index set is an R0 -ring R together\nwith a family {\u03c1i : Ri \u2192 R | i \u2208 I} of R0 -homomorphisms such that, for any R0 -ring S with a family of R0 homomorphisms {\u03c4i : Ri \u2192 S | i \u2208 I}, there is a unique R0 -homomorphism \u03b4 : R \u2192 S such that \u03c4i = \u03c1i \u03b4 for all\ni \u2208 I.\nIt is well-known that the coproduct of a family {Ri | i \u2208 I} of R0 -rings exists. In this case, we denote their\ncoproduct by \u2294R0 Ri . For example, the coproduct of the polynomial rings k[x] and k[y] over k is the free ring\nk < x, y > in two variables over k. Note that R0 \u2294R0 S = S = S \u2294R0 R0 for every\n\u0013\n\u0012 R0 -ring S.\nR1 R1 \u2297R0 R2\n. Let e1 =\nLet Ri be an R0 -ring for i = 1, 2. We denote by B the matrix ring\n0\nR2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nr1\nr1 \u2297 1\n0 0\n1 0\n\u2208 B, and \u03c6 : Be1 \u2192 Be2 be the map that sends\nto\nfor r1 \u2208 R1 .\n, e2 =\n0 1\n0\n0\n0 0\nLet \u03c1i : Ri \u2192 R1 \u2294R0 R2 be the canonical R0 -homomorphism for i = 1, 2.\nThe following lemma reveals a relationship between coproducts and localizations.\nLemma 6.1. [36, Theorem 4.10, p. 59] The universal localization B\u03c6 of B at \u03c6 is equal to M2 (R1 \u2294R0 R2 ),\nthe 2 \u00d7 2 matrix ring over the coproduct R1 \u2294\u0012\nR0 R2 of R1 and\u0013R2 over\n\u0012 R0 . Furthermore, the\u0013corresponding\n(r1 )\u03c11 (x1 )\u03c11 (x2 )\u03c12\nr1 x1 \u2297 x2\nfor ri , xi \u2208 Ri\n7\u2192\nring homomorphism \u03bb\u03c6 : B \u2192 B\u03c6 is given by\n0\n(r2 )\u03c12\n0\nr2\nwith i = 1, 2.\nThe next result says, in some sense, that coproducts of rings preserve universal localizations.\nLemma 6.2. Let R0 be a ring, \u03a3 a set of homomorphisms between finitely generated projective R0 -modules,\nand \u03bb\u03a3 : R0 \u2192 R1 := (R0 )\u03a3 the universal localization of R0 at \u03a3. Then, for any R0 -ring R2 , the coproduct\nR1 \u2294R0 R2 is isomorphic to the universal localization (R2 )\u2206 of R2 at the set \u2206, where \u2206 := {R2 \u2297R0 f | f \u2208 \u03a3}.\nProof. Let R := (R2 )\u2206 , and let \u03bb\u2206 : R2 \u2192 R be the universal localization of R2 at \u2206. Suppose that \u03bbR2 : R0 \u2192\nR2 is the ring homomorphism defining the R0 -ring R2 . Then R is an R0 - ring via the composition \u03bbR2 \u03bb\u2206 of \u03bbR2\n26\n\n\fwith \u03bb\u2206 . Moreover, we shall prove that there is a unique R0 -ring homomorphism \u03bd : R1 \u2192 R, that is, a ring\nhomomorphism \u03bd with \u03bbR2 \u03bb\u2206 = \u03bb\u03a3 \u03bd. In fact, for any f : P1 \u2192 P0 in \u03a3, the map R \u2297R0 f : R \u2297R0 P1 \u2192 R \u2297R0 P0\nof R-modules is an isomorphism because R \u2297R0 f \u2243 R \u2297R2 (R2 \u2297R0 f ), where the later is an isomorphism.\nThus, by the property of the universal localization \u03bb\u03a3 , there is a unique ring homomorphism \u03bd : R1 \u2192 R such\nthat \u03bbR2 \u03bb\u2206 = \u03bb\u03a3 \u03bd, as desired.\nNow, we show that R together with the two ring homomorphisms \u03bb\u2206 and \u03bd satisfies the definition of\ncoproducts, and therefore R1 \u2294R0 R2 is isomorphic to R.\nIndeed, suppose that S is an arbitrary R0 -ring with two R0 -homomorphisms \u03c4i : Ri \u2192 S for i = 1, 2. Then\n\u03bb\u03a3 \u03c41 = \u03bbR2 \u03c42 . Further, since we have\nS \u2297R2 (R2 \u2297R0 h) \u2243 S \u2297R0 h \u2243 S \u2297R1 (R1 \u2297R0 h),\nand since R1 \u2297R0 h is an isomorphism for any h \u2208 \u03a3, we infer that S \u2297R2 (R2 \u2297R0 h) is an isomorphism for\nany h \u2208 \u03a3. It follows from the property of universal localizations that there is a unique ring homomorphism\n\u03b4 : R \u2192 S such that \u03c42 = \u03bb\u2206 \u03b4. Clearly, \u03bb\u03a3 \u03c41 = \u03bb\u03a3 \u03bd\u03b4, and \u03c41 = \u03bd\u03b4 since \u03bb\u03a3 is a ring epimorphism. Note that\n\u03b4 is also an R0 -ring homomorphism. Thus, there is a unique R0 -homomorphism \u03b4 : R \u2192 S such that \u03c41 = \u03bc\u03b4\nand \u03c42 = \u03bb\u2206 \u03b4. This shows that the coproduct R1 \u2294R0 R2 of R1 and R2 over R0 is isomorphic to R. \u0003\nSometimes, coproducts can be interpreted as tensor products of rings.\nLemma 6.3. Let R0 be a commutative ring and let Ri be an R0 -algebra for i = 1, 2. If one of the homomorphisms \u03bbR1 : R0 \u2192 R1 and \u03bbR2 : R0 \u2192 R2 is a ring epimorphism, then the coproduct R1 \u2294R0 R2 is isomorphic\nto the tensor product R1 \u2297R0 R2 .\nProof. It is known that the tensor product R1 \u2297R0 R2 of two rings R1 and R2 over R0 has the following\nuniversal property: If fi : Ri \u2192 R is a homomorphism of R0 -rings for i = 1, 2, such that (r2 ) f2 (r1 ) f1 =\n(r1 ) f1 (r2 ) f2 for all ri \u2208 Ri with i = 1, 2, then there is a unique ring homomorphism f : R1 \u2297R0 R2 \u2192 R of\nR0 -rings that satisfies (x1 \u2297 x2 ) f = (x1 ) f1 (x2 ) f2 for xi \u2208 Ri with i = 1, 2. In particular, if \u03bb1 : R1 \u2192 R1 \u2297R0 R2\nis the map given by r1 7\u2192 r1 \u2297 1 for r1 \u2208 R1 , and if \u03bb2 : R2 \u2192 R1 \u2297R0 R2 is the one given by r2 7\u2192 1 \u2297 r2 for\nr2 \u2208 R2 , then fi = \u03bbi f for i = 1, 2.\nTo prove Lemma 6.3, it suffices to show that, for any R0 -homomorphisms fi : Ri \u2192 R for i = 1, 2, the\ncondition (r2 ) f2 (r1 ) f1 = (r1 ) f1 (r2 ) f2 holds true for all ri \u2208 Ri with i = 1, 2.\nAssume that \u03bbR1 : R0 \u2192 R1 is a ring epimorphism. For any element y \u2208 R2 , we define two ring homomorphisms \u03b81 : R1 \u2192 M2 (R) and \u03b82 : R1 \u2192 M2 (R) as follows:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(x) f1\n0\n(x)\u03b81 =\n0\n(x) f1\nand\n(x)\u03b82 =\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n0\n(y) f2 1\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n(x) f1\n0\n0\n(x) f1\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n1\n0\n\u2212(y) f2 1\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n(x) f1\n0\n(y) f2 (x) f1 \u2212 (x) f1 (y) f2 (x) f1\n\n\u0013\n\nfor x \u2208 R1 . Now, we verify \u03bbR1 \u03b81 = \u03bbR1 \u03b82 . This is equivalent to showing that, if x = (r)\u03bbR1 with r \u2208 R0 , then\n(y) f2 (x) f1 = (x) f1 (y) f2 . In fact, we always have\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(y) f2 (x) f1 = (y) f2 (r)\u03bbR1 f1 = (y) f2 (r)\u03bbR2 f2 = y(r)\u03bbR2 f2 ;\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(x) f1 (y) f2 = (r)\u03bbR1 f1 (y) f2 = (r)\u03bbR2 f2 (y) f2 = (r)\u03bbR2 y f2 .\n\nSince R2 is an R0 -algebra, it follows from Im(\u03bbR2 ) \u2286 Z(R2 ) that y(r)\u03bbR2 = (r)\u03bbR2 y, and so (y) f2 (x) f1 =\n(x) f1 (y) f2 whenever x = (r)\u03bbR1 with r \u2208 R0 . This shows \u03bbR1 \u03b81 = \u03bbR1 \u03b82 and \u03b81 = \u03b82 since \u03bbR1 : R0 \u2192 R1 is\n27\n\n\fa ring epimorphism. Thus (y) f2 (x) f1 = (x) f1 (y) f2 for any x \u2208 R1 . Note that y is an arbitrary element of R2 .\nHence (y) f2 (x) f1 = (x) f1 (y) f2 for any x \u2208 R1 and y \u2208 R2 .\nAs a result, the tensor product R1 \u2297R0 R2 together with the two ring homomorphisms \u03bbi satisfies the\ndefinition of coproducts, and we therefore have proved that the coproduct R1 \u2294R0 R2 is isomorphic to the\ntensor product R1 \u2297R0 R2 . Similarly, we can prove Lemma 6.3 under the assumption that \u03bbR2 : R0 \u2192 R2 is a\nring epimorphism. \u0003\nFrom now on, let \u03bb : R \u2192 S denote an injective ring homomorphism from R to S. We define B to be\nthe endomorphism ring of the R-module S \u2295 S/R, and S\u2032 the endomorphism ring of the R-module S/R. Let\n\u03c0 stands for the canonical surjective map S \u2192 S/R of R-modules. Then we have an exact sequence of Rmodules:\n\u03c0\n(\u2217) 0 \u2212\u2192 R \u2212\u2192 S \u2212\u2192 S/R \u2212\u2192 0.\nIn the next lemmas, we collect some facts on ring epimorphisms.\nLemma 6.4. Let \u03bb : R \u2192 S be an injective ring epimorphism with TorR1 (S, S) = 0. Then,\n(1) an R-module X belongs to S-Mod if and only if ExtiR (S/R, X ) = 0 for i = 0, 1.\n(2) Let T := S \u2295 S/R. Then\n\u0012\n\u0013\nS HomR (S, S/R)\nEndR (T ) \u2243\n.\n0\nEndR (S/R)\nMoreover, if e1 and e2 are the idempotent elements in EndR (T ) corresponding to the summands S and S/R,\n\u2217\nrespectively, then the homomorphism\n\u0012 \u0013 \u0012 \u03c0 : EndR (T\u0013)e1 \u2192 EndR (T )e2 induced from the canonical surjection\ns\n(x 7\u2192 (xs)\u03c0\n\u03c0 : S \u2192 S/R is given by\n7\u2192\nfor s, x \u2208 S.\n0\n0\nProof. (1) follows from [23]. For (2), it follows from (1) that HomR (S/R, S) = 0. By applying HomR (\u2212, S)\nto the exact sequence (\u2217), we get HomR (S, S) \u2243 HomR (R, S) \u2243 S. \u0003\nLemma 6.5. Suppose that \u03bb : R \u2192 S is an injective ring epimorphism with TorR1 (S, S) = 0.\n(1) The right multiplication map \u03bc : R \u2192 S\u2032 defined by r 7\u2192 (x 7\u2192 xr) for r \u2208 R and x \u2208 S/R, is a ring\nhomomorphism. Consequently, S\u2032 can be regarded as an R-ring via the map \u03bc. Further, \u03bc is an isomorphism\nif and only if ExtiR (S, R) = 0 for i = 0, 1.\n(2) There is an isomorphism \u03b8 : S \u2297R S\u2032 \u2243 HomR (S, S/R) of S-S\u2032 -bimodules such that 1 \u2297 1 is mapped to\nthe canonical surjection \u03c0 : S \u2192 S/R.\n(3) There is an exact sequence of R-S\u2032 -modules:\n\u03bb\u2032\n\n\u03c0\u2297S\u2032\n\n0 \u2192 S\u2032 \u2212\u2192 S \u2297R S\u2032 \u2212\u2192 (S/R) \u2297R S\u2032 \u2192 0,\nwhere the map \u03bb\u2032 is defined by f 7\u2192 1\u2297 f for any f \u2208 S\u2032 . Moreover, the evaluation map \u03c8 : (S/R)\u2297R S\u2032 \u2192 S/R\ndefined by y \u2297 g 7\u2192 (y)g for y \u2208 S/R and g \u2208 S\u2032 , is an isomorphism of R-S\u2032 -bimodules.\n(4) If \u03bb : R \u2192 S is homological, then TorRi (S, S\u2032 ) = 0 for any i > 0.\n(5) If R is commutative, then so is S\u2032 .\nProof. (1) It is easy to checked that the right multiplication map \u03bc is a ring homomorphism since S/R\nis an R-R-bimodule. Clearly, \u03bc is injective if and only if HomR (S, R) = 0. For the condition of \u03bc being\nsurjective, we use the following exact sequence:\n0 \u2212\u2192 HomR (S, R) \u2212\u2192 HomR (S, S) \u2212\u2192 HomR (S, S/R) \u2212\u2192 Ext1R (S, R) \u2212\u2192 Ext1R (S, S),\nwhere Ext1R (S, S) = 0 by Lemma 6.4(1). Thus (1) follows.\n28\n\n\f(2) Note that a ring homomorphism is an epimorphism if and only if the multiplication map S \u2297R S \u2192 S\nis an isomorphism as S-S-bimodules. Since \u03bb is injective, it follows from the exact sequence (\u2217) that we have\na long exact sequence of S-R-bimodules:\n1\u2297\u03bb\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 TorR1 (S, S) \u2212\u2192 TorR1 (S, S/R) \u2212\u2192 S \u2297R R \u2212\u2192 S \u2297R S \u2212\u2192 S \u2297R (S/R) \u2212\u2192 0.\nSince TorR1 (S, S) = 0 and 1 \u2297R \u03bb is an isomorphism of S-R-modules, we have S \u2297R (S/R) = 0 = TorR1 (S, S/R).\nNow, by applying HomR (\u2212, S/R) to (\u2217), we can get another exact sequence of R-EndR (S/R)-bimodules:\n(\u2217\u2217)\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 HomR (S/R, S/R) \u2212\u2192 HomR (S, S/R) \u2212\u2192 HomR (R, S/R).\n\nOne can check that the last homomorphism in the above sequence is surjective because each element x + R\nin S/R gives rise to at least one homomorphism from the R-module S to the R-module S/R by s 7\u2192 sx + R for\ns \u2208 S. This yields the following exact sequence of S-EndR (S/R)-bimodules:\n0 \u2212\u2192 S \u2297R HomR (S/R, S/R) \u2212\u2192 S \u2297R HomR (S, S/R) \u2212\u2192 S \u2297R (S/R) \u2212\u2192 0,\n\u223c\n\nwhich shows that S \u2297R HomR (S/R, S/R) \u2212\u2192 S \u2297R HomR (S, S/R). Clearly, under this isomorphism the element 1 \u2297R 1 in S \u2297 HomR (S/R, S/R) is sent to 1 \u2297 \u03c0. Since the multiplication map: S \u2297R S \u2212\u2192 S is an isomorphism of S-S-bimodules, we see that the multiplication map: S \u2297R X \u2192 X is an isomorphism for every Smodule X . Clearly, HomR (R SS , S/R) is an S-module. So, it follows that S \u2297R HomR (S, S/R) \u2192 HomR (S, S/R)\nis an isomorphism under which\n1 \u2297 \u03c0 is sent to \u03c0. As a result, the map \u03b8 : S \u2297R S\u2032 \u2192 HomR (S, S/R) defined\n\u0001\nby s \u2297 f 7\u2192 t 7\u2192 (ts)(\u03c0 f ) for s,t \u2208 S and f \u2208 S\u2032 , is an isomorphism of S-S\u2032 -bimodules. Clearly, under this\nisomorphism, the element 1 \u2297 1 in S \u2297R S\u2032 is sent to \u03c0.\n(3) Applying \u2212 \u2297R S\u2032 to the sequence (\u2217) and identifying R \u2297R S\u2032 with S\u2032 , we then obtain the following\nright exact sequence of R-S\u2032 -bimodules:\n\u03bb\u2032\n\n\u03c0\u2297S\u2032\n\n(\u2660) S\u2032 \u2212\u2192 S \u2297R S\u2032 \u2212\u2192 (S/R) \u2297R S\u2032 \u2192 0,\nwhere the map \u03bb\u2032 is defined by f 7\u2192 1 \u2297 f for any f \u2208 S\u2032 . Combining this sequence with (\u2217\u2217), one can check\nthat the following diagram of R-S\u2032 -bimodules is exact and commutative:\n\u03bb\u2032\n\nS\u2032\n\n/ S \u2297 S\u2032\nR\n\n\u03c0\u2297S\u2032\n\n/ (S/R) \u2297R S\u2032\n\u03c8\n\n\u03b8\n\n0\n\n/ HomR (S/R, S/R)\n\n\u03c0\u2217\n\n/0\n\n\u000f\n\n/ HomR (S, S/R)\n\n\u000f\n/ S/R\n\n/0\n\nis commutative, where \u03c8 is the evaluation map, and where HomR (R, S/R) is identified with S/R as R-S\u2032 bimodules. Since \u03b8 is an isomorphism, we infer that \u03bb\u2032 is injective, and that \u03c8 is an isomorphism of R-S\u2032 bimodules.\n(4) Suppose that \u03bb is an injective homological ring epimorphism. Let i be any positive integer. Then\nTorRi (S, S) = 0. Recall that we have proved that S \u2297R (S/R) = 0 = TorR1 (S, S/R) in (2). Thus, by applying the\ntensor functor S \u2297R \u2212 to the canonical sequence (\u2217), we conclude that TorRi (S, S/R) = 0. By (3), we know\nthat (S/R) \u2297R S\u2032 \u2243 S/R as left R-modules. Thus TorRi (S, (S/R) \u2297R S\u2032 ) = 0. Since S \u2297R S\u2032 is a left S-module, it\nfollows from Lemma 2.2(2) that TorRi (S, S \u2297R S\u2032 ) = 0. Now, applying the tensor functor S \u2297R \u2212 to the exact\nsequence (\u2660), we obtain TorRi (S, S\u2032 ) = 0.\n(5) Since R is commutative, the tensor product S \u2297R S\u2032 of S and S\u2032 over R is a ring, which is well-defined.\nBy Lemma 6.5(3), there exists an exact sequence of R-S\u2032 -modules:\n\u03bb\u2032\n\n\u03c0\u2297S\u2032\n\n0 \u2192 S\u2032 \u2212\u2192 S \u2297R S\u2032 \u2212\u2192 (S/R) \u2297R S\u2032 \u2192 0.\n29\n\n\fSince \u03bb\u2032 is a ring homomorphism, the ring S \u2297R S\u2032 can be considered an S\u2032 -S\u2032 -bimodule via \u03bb\u2032 , and therefore,\n(S/R) \u2297R S\u2032 can also be regarded as an S\u2032 -S\u2032 -bimodule. In addition, by Lemma 6.5(3), the evaluation map\n\u03c8 : (S/R) \u2297R S\u2032 \u2192 S/R defined by y \u2297 g 7\u2192 (y)g for any y \u2208 S/R and g \u2208 S\u2032 , is an isomorphism of R-S\u2032 bimodules. Since the image of (y)g \u2297 1 under \u03c8 is also equal to (y)g, we have (y)g \u2297 1 = y \u2297 g in (S/R) \u2297R S\u2032 .\nConsequently, for any f , g \u2208 S\u2032 and y \u2208 S/R, we get y\u2297 f g = f (y\u2297 g) = f ((y)g\u2297 1) = (y)g\u2297 f in (S/R)\u2297R S\u2032 ,\n\u2032\n\u2032\nwhere the first and\n\u0001 third equalities\n\u0001 follow from the left S -module structure of (S/R) \u2297R S . This yields that\n(y) f g = y \u2297 f g \u03c8 = (y)g \u2297 f \u03c8 = (y)g f in S/R. Thus f g = g f . Since f and g are arbitrary elements in\nS\u2032 , we see that S\u2032 is a commutative ring. \u0003\nAs a consequence of Theorem 1.1, we have the following corollary.\nCorollary 6.6. (1) Let \u03bb : R \u2192 S be an injective ring epimorphism such that TorR1 (S, S) = 0. If R S has\nprojective dimension at most one, then there is a recollement of derived module categories:\nw\n\nx\n/ D(B)\nf\n\nD(S \u2294R S\u2032 )\ng\n\n/ D(R) ,\n\nwhere S \u2294R S\u2032 is the coproduct of S and S\u2032 over R.\n(2) Let R be a ring, \u03a3 a left Ore set of regular elements of R, and S := \u03a3\u22121 R the localization of R at \u03a3. If\nR S has projective dimension at most one, then the recollement in (1) exists.\nProof. (1) Now, let R0 = R, R1 = S, R2 = EndR (S/R), T := S \u2295 S/R, and B = EndR (S \u2295 S/R). It is well\nknown that, under the above assumptions, T := S \u2295 S/R is a good tilting R-module (see [5]). By Lemma 6.5,\nthe map \u03c6 in Lemma 6.1 is precisely the map \u03c0\u2217 in Lemma 6.4(2) under the identification of \u03b8 in Lemma 6.5.\nThus the localization of B at \u03c0\u2217 is isomorphic to the 2 \u00d7 2 matrix ring over the coproduct of S and S\u2032 over R\nby Lemma 6.1. Thus Corollary 6.6(1) follows from Theorem 1.1(1).\n(2) follows from (1). \u0003\nThe tilting module S \u2295 S/R in Corollary 6.6 has an equivalent form (see [5, Theorem 2.10]), by which\nwe can restate Corollary 6.6 in the following form. Here we present explicitly the R-ring homomorphisms\nwhich will be used for later calculations in Section 8.\nCorollary 6.7. Let R be a ring, and let R T be a tilting R-module with an exact sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 R \u2212\u2192 T0 \u2212\u2192 T1 \u2212\u2192 0\nof R-modules such that Ti \u2208 Add(T ) and HomR (T1 , T0 ) = 0. Set S := EndR (T0 ), S\u2032 := EndR (T1 ) and B :=\nEndR (T0 \u2295 T1 ). Then there is the following recollement:\nw\n\nx\n/ D(B)\nf\n\nD(S \u2294R S\u2032 )\ng\n\n/ D(R) ,\n\nwhere S \u2294R S\u2032 is the coproduct of S and S\u2032 over R.\nProof. First of all, we show that S and S\u2032 can be regarded as R-rings, namely, we construct two ring\nhomomorphisms \u03bb : R \u2192 S and \u03bc : R \u2192 S\u2032 (see Lemma 6.5(1)). For any r \u2208 R, we denote by \u03c1r : R \u2192 R\nthe right multiplication map by the element r. It follows from HomR (T1 , T0 ) = 0 = Ext1R (T1 , T0 ) that there\nexists a unique homomorphism f : T0 \u2192 T0 and therefore a unique homomorphism g : T1 \u2192 T1 such that the\nfollowing exact diagram\n/ T1\n/0\n/ T0\n/R\n0\n\u001f\n\u001f\n\u03c1r\n\n0\n\n\u000f\n/R\n\n\u001f\n\ng\n\n\u001f\u000f\n\n\u001f\n\u000f\n/ T1\n\nf\n\n/ T0\n\n30\n\n\u001f\n/0\n\n\fcommutes. Now, we define \u03bb : R \u2192 S and \u03bc : R \u2192 S\u2032 by sending r to f and sending r to g, respectively.\nOne can check directly that \u03bb is injective, and that \u03bb and \u03bc are ring homomorphisms. Furthermore, by the\nproof of [5, Theorem 2.10], there are isomorphisms \u03c6 : T0 \u2192 S and \u03c8 : T1 \u2192 S/R of R-modules, such that the\nfollowing exact diagram of R-modules\n/R\n\n0\n\n/R\n\n0\n\n\u03bb\n\n/ T0\n\n/ T1\n\n\u03c6 \u2240\n\n\u03c8 \u2240\n\n\u000f\n\n/S\n\n\u03c0\n\n/0\n\n\u000f\n/ S/R\n\n/0\n\nis commutative. Now, Corollary 6.7 follows from Corollary 6.6. \u0003.\nRemarks. (1) In general, Corollary 6.6(1) supplies us a class of recollements which cannot be obtained\nfrom the structure of triangular matrix rings.\nIf ExtiR (S, R) = 0 for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 1 in Corollary 6.6(1), then S\u2032 \u2243 R by Lemma 6.5(1), and therefore S \u2294R S\u2032 \u2243\nS \u2294R R = S. Even in this case, the recollement in Corollary 6.6(1) is not equivalent to the one induced from\nthe triangular matrix ring (see Lemma 6.4(2)) since they are induced by non-equivalent homological ring\nepimorphisms B \u2192 M2 (S) and B \u2192 S, respectively. See Section 7 below for more examples.\n(2) In Corollary 6.6(1), the condition that \"R S has projective dimension at most one\" ensures the category\nD(B)\u03a3\u22a5 in Corollary 3.6 can be replaced by the derived module category of a ring. However, this condition\nis not necessary for getting such a recollement. In fact, we have the following result.\nLet \u03bb : R \u2192 S be an injective ring epimorphism such that TorR1 (S, S) = 0. Suppose that the right multiplication map \u03bc : R \u2192 S\u2032 defined in Lemma 6.5(1) is an isomorphism of rings. Then the universal localization\n\u03bb\u03c0\u2217 : B \u2192 B\u03c0\u2217 of B at \u03c0\u2217 is homological. In particular, D(B){\u03c0\u2217 }\u22a5 in Corollary 3.6 can be replaced by D(S).\n\u0012\n\u0013\nS S\nProof. Combining Lemmata 6.1 and 6.4(2) with 6.5(2), we know that B \u2243\nand B\u03c0\u2217 \u2243 M2 (S)\n0 R\nas rings. Under these\nthe universal localization \u03bb\u03c0\u2217 : B \u2192 B\u03c0\u2217 is equivalent to the canonical\n\u0012 isomorphisms,\n\u0013\nS S\ninjection \u03c7 : R1 :=\n\u2192 M2 (S) induced by the injection \u03bb : R \u2192 S. Clearly, M2 (S) is projective\n0 R\nas a right R1 -module. Thus \u03c7 is homological, and consequently, \u03bb\u03c0\u2217 is homological, and D(S) is triangle\nequivalent to D(B){\u03c0\u2217 }\u22a5 by Proposition 3.5. \u0003\nLet us give\n\uf8eb a concrete example satisfying\n\uf8f6 all conditions in the remark (2).\nk\n0\n0\nLet R = \uf8ed k[x]/(x2 )\nk\n0 \uf8f8 , where k is a field and k[x] is the polynomial algebra over k in one\nk[x]/(x2 ) k[x]/(x2 ) k\n\nvariable x, and let S be the 3 by 3 matrix ring M3 (k[x]/(x2 )). Then the inclusion \u03bb of R into S is a universal\nlocalization of R, so it is a ring epimorphism. Further, we have TorR1 (S, S) = 0 6= TorR2 (S, S) (see [31]). Thus\nit is not homological. So, R S cannot have projective dimension less than or equal to one. But one can check\nthat \u03bc defined in Lemma 6.5 is an isomorphism.\nThis example also shows that Proposition 6.8 below may be false if the injective ring epimorphism \u03bb :\nR \u2192 S is not homological.\n(3) Under the conditions of Remark (2), one can get another pattern of recollements, namely, we have the\nfollowing result.\nLet \u03bb : R \u2192 S be an injective ring epimorphism such that TorR1 (S, S) = 0. Suppose that the right multiplication map \u03bc : R \u2192 EndR (S/R) defined in Lemma 6.5(1) is an isomorphism of rings. Then there is a\nrecollement of derived module categories of S, B and R:\nx\n\nD(R)\nf\n\nx\n/ D(B)\nf\n\n31\n\n/ D(S) .\n\n\f\u03bb\n\n\u03c0\n\nProof. Note that the sequence 0 \u2212\u2192 R \u2212\u2192 S \u2212\u2192 S/R \u2212\u2192 0 is an add(R S)-split sequence in R-Mod. By\n[26, Theorem 3.5], we conclude that B is derived\nequivalent\nto the endomorphism ring EndR (R \u2295 S) which\n\u0012\n\u0013\nR S\nis isomorphic to the triangular matrix ring\n. Consequently, we can get the above recollement of\n0 S\nderived module categories of S, B and R by the structure of triangular matrix rings. \u0003\nA variation of Corollary 6.6(1) is the following proposition in which we relax the condition of being\ntilting modules, and require ring epimorphisms to be homological.\nLet \u03bb : R \u2192 S be an injective ring homomorphism between rings R and S. We consider S\u2032 := EndR (S/R)\nas an R-ring via \u03bc defined in Lemma 6.5. Furthermore, let \u03c1 : S \u2192 S \u2294R S\u2032 and \u03c1\u2032 : S\u2032 \u2192 S \u2294R S\u2032 be the canonical\nR-homomorphisms in the definition of coproducts of R-rings.\nProposition 6.8. If \u03bb : R \u2192 S is an injective homological ring epimorphism, then the following assertions\nare equivalent:\n(1) The universal localization \u03bb\u03c0\u2217 : B \u2192 B\u03c0\u2217 of B at \u03c0\u2217 is homological.\n(2) The ring homomorphism \u03c1\u2032 : S\u2032 \u2192 S \u2294R S\u2032 is homological.\nIn particular, if one of the above assertions holds, then there is a recollement of derived module categories:\nw\nx\n/ D(R) .\n/ D(B)\nD(S \u2294R S\u2032 )\nf\n\ng\n\nProof. Recall that S\u2032 is an R-ring via the right multiplication map \u03bc : R \u2192 S\u2032 , defined by r 7\u2192 (x 7\u2192 xr)\nfor r \u2208 R and x \u2208 S/R (see Lemma 6.5(1)). Then it follows from the definition of coproducts of rings that\n\u03bb\u03c1 = \u03bc\u03c1\u2032 : R \u2192 S \u2294R S\u2032 .\nStep (1). We claim that, for any S \u2294R S\u2032 -module W , if we regard W as a left S\u2032 -module via the ring\n\u2032\nhomomorphism \u03c1\u2032 , then (S \u2297R S\u2032 ) \u2297S\u2032 W \u2243 W as S-modules, and TorSi (S \u2297R S\u2032 ,W ) = 0 for any i > 0.\nTo prove this, we fix a projective resolution Q\u2022 of SR :\n* * * \u2212\u2192 Qn \u2212\u2192 Qn\u22121 \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2212\u2192 Q1 \u2212\u2192 Q0 \u2212\u2192 SR \u2212\u2192 0\nwith Qi projective right R-modules. By Lemma 6.5(4), we have TorRj (S, S\u2032 ) = 0 for any j > 0. It follows\nthat the complex Q\u2022 \u2297R S\u2032 is a projective resolution of the right S\u2032 -module S \u2297R S\u2032 . Note that we have the\nfollowing isomorphisms of complexes of abelian groups:\n\u0001\n\u0001\nQ\u2022 \u2297R S\u2032 \u2297S\u2032 W \u2243 Q\u2022 \u2297R S\u2032 \u2297S\u2032 W \u2243 Q\u2022 \u2297R W.\n\u2032\n\nThis implies that TorSi (S \u2297R S\u2032 ,W ) \u2243 TorRi (S,W ) for any i > 0. Clearly, W admits an S-module structure\nvia the map \u03c1. Moreover, it follows from \u03bb\u03c1 = \u03bc\u03c1\u2032 that the R-module structure of W endowed via the ring\nhomomorphism \u03bc\u03c1\u2032 is the same as that endowed via the ring homomorphism \u03bb\u03c1. Then, by Lemma 2.2, we\n\u2032\nconclude that S \u2297R W \u2243 W as S-modules, and that TorRi (S,W ) = 0 for i > 0. Therefore, TorSi (S \u2297R S\u2032 ,W ) = 0\nfor i > 0. Note that (S \u2297R S\u2032 ) \u2297S\u2032 W \u2243 S \u2297R W as S-modules. As a result, we have (S \u2297R S\u2032 ) \u2297S\u2032 W \u2243 W. This\nfinish the proof of Step (1).\nStep (2). We shall prove that B\u03c0\u2217 is Morita equivalent to the ring S \u2294R S\u2032 .\nBy Lemmata 6.4(2) and 6.5(2), there are isomorphisms of rings\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nS HomR (S, S/R)\nS S \u2297R S \u2032\nB := EndR (T ) \u2243\n\u2243 C :=\n,\n0\nS\u2032\n0\nEndR (S/R)\n\n32\n\n\f\u0012\n\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 \u03c0\n0 1\u22971\n1 0\n0 0\nto\n.

Then \u03c0\u2217 corresponds to \u03c6 under\n0\n0\nthe isomorphism B \u2243 C. Let \u03bb\u03c6 : C \u2192 C\u03c6 be the universal localization of C at \u03c6. Then, we have B\u03c0\u2217 \u2243 C\u03c6 .\nNote that \u03bb\u03c0\u2217 is homological if and only if \u03bb\u03c6 is homological.\nBy Lemma 6.1, we know that C\u03c6 = M2 (S \u2294R S\u2032 ), the 2 \u00d7 2 \u0012matrix ring \u0013\nover \u0012\nS \u2294R S\u2032 , and that the\u0013cors t\u2297 f\n(s)\u03c1 (t)\u03c1( f )\u03c1\u2032\nresponding ring epimorphism \u03bb\u03c6 : C \u2192 M2 (S \u2294R S\u2032 ) is given by\n7\u2192\nfor\n0\n(g)\u03c1\u2032\n0\ng\ns,t \u2208 S and f , g \u2208 S\u2032 . Hence, B\u03c0\u2217 \u2243 \u039b, and therefore B\u03c0\u2217 is Morita equivalent to S \u2294R S\u2032 .\nStep (3). We shall prove that the ring homomorphism \u03bb\u03c6 : C \u2192 M2 (S \u2294R S\u2032 ) is homological if and only if\nso is the ring homomorphism \u03c1\u2032 : S\u2032 \u2192 S \u2294R S\u2032 .\nBefore starting our proof, we mention a general result: if F : C \u2192 E is an exact functor between abelian\ncategories C and E , then F\u0001can be extended to a canonical triangle functor F : D(\n\u0001 C ) \u2192 D(E ), which sends\nthe complex X \u2022 := X i , dXi i\u2208Z over C to the complex F(X \u2022 ) := F(X i ), F(dXi ) i\u2208Z over E . This is due to\nthe fact that F preserves quasi-isomorphisms. Since F is completely determined by F, we may write F for\nF.\nSet \u0393 := S \u2294R S\u2032 , \u039b := M2 (\u0393) and e\u2032 := (e)\u03bb\u03c6 \u2208 \u039b. Then e\u2032 = (e\u2032 )2 , End\u039b (\u039be\u2032 ) \u2243 \u0393 and EndC (Ce) \u2243 S\u2032 .\nObserve that \u039be\u2032 is a projective generator for \u039b-Mod. Then, by Morita theory, we know that the tensor\nfunctor e\u2032 \u039b \u2297\u039b \u2212 : \u039b-Mod \u2212\u2192 \u0393-Mod is an equivalence of module categories, which can be extended to a\ncanonical triangle equivalence from D(\u039b) to D(\u0393).\nNote that eC \u2297 C \u039b \u2243 e\u039b as S\u2032 -\u039b-bimodules, where the left S\u2032 -module structure of e\u2032 \u039b is induced by the\nring homomorphism \u03c1\u2032 : S\u2032 \u2192 \u0393. It follows that the following diagram of functors between module categories\nwhere the second isomorphism sends\n\n\u039b-Mod\n\ne\u2032 \u039b\u2297\u039b \u2212\n\n/ \u0393-Mod\n(\u03c1\u2032 )\u2217\n\n(\u03bb\u03c6 )\u2217\n\n\u000f\n\nC-Mod\n\neC\u2297C \u2212\n\n\u000f\n\n/ S\u2032 -Mod\n\nis commutative, where (\u03bb\u03c6 )\u2217 and (\u03c1\u2032 )\u2217 stand for the restriction functors induced by the ring homomorphisms\n\u03bb\u03c6 : C \u2192 \u039b and \u03c1\u2032 : S\u2032 \u2192 \u0393, respectively. Since all of the functors appearing in the diagram are exact, we can\nform the following commutative diagram of functors between derived module categories:\nD(\u039b)\n\ne\u2032 \u039b\u2297\u039b \u2212\n\n/ D(\u0393)\n(\u03c1\u2032 )\u2217\n\n(\u03bb\u03c6 )\u2217\n\n\u000f\n\nD(C)\n\neC\u2297C \u2212\n\n\u000f\n\n/ D(S\u2032 ),\n\nwhere the upper tensor functor e\u2032 \u039b \u2297\u039b \u2212 is a triangle equivalence.\nFrom the triangular structure of C it follows that there is a recollement of derived module categories:\nCe\u2297LS\u2032 \u2212\n\n}\n\nD(S)\na\n\n}\n/ D(C) eC\u2297C \u2212/ D(S\u2032 ) .\na\n\n\u0001\nIn particular, the pair Tria(Ce), Tria(Ce1 ) is a torsion pair in D(C), and the functor eC \u2297C \u2212 induces a\ntriangle equivalence between Tria(Ce) and D(S\u2032 ).\n33\n\n\fWe claim that the image of\n\u0001 the restriction functor (\u03bb\u03c6 )\u2217 belongs to Tria(Ce). This implies that, for any\ncomplexes X \u2022 ,Y \u2022 \u2208 Im (\u03bb\u03c6 )\u2217 , we have\n\u223c\n\nHomD(C) (X \u2022 ,Y \u2022 ) \u2212\u2192 HomD(S\u2032 ) (eX \u2022 , eY \u2022 ),\n\nwhere the functor eC \u2297C \u2212 is identified with the left multiplication functor by the element e. Clearly, the\nfunctor (\u03bb\u03c6 )\u2217 can commute with small coproducts since it admits a right adjoint. In addition, D(\u039b) =\nTria(\u039be\u2032 ). Therefore, to prove this claim, it suffices to prove \u039be\u2032 \u2208 Tria(Ce). This is equivalent to showing\nthat Ce \u2297LS\u2032 e\u039be\u2032 \u2243 \u039be\u2032 in D(C).\nSet M := S \u2297R S\u2032 . Note that C is a triangular matrix ring. Recall that any C-module can be expressed\nin the form of the triple (X ,Y, h) with X \u2208 S\u2032 -Mod, Y \u2208 S-Mod and h : M \u2297S\u2032 X \u2192 Y an S-morphism. The\nmorphisms between two modules (X ,Y, h) and (X \u2032 ,Y \u2032 , h\u2032 ) are pairs of morphisms (\u03b1, \u03b2), where \u03b1 : X \u2192 X \u2032\nand \u03b2 : Y \u2192 Y \u2032 are homomorphisms in S\u2032 -Mod and S-Mod, respectively, such that h\u03b2 = (M \u2297S\u2032 \u03b1)h\u2032 .\nWith these interpretations, we rewrite \u039be\u2032 = (\u0393, \u0393, u) \u2208 C-Mod, where u : M \u2297S\u2032 \u0393 \u2192 \u0393 is defined by\n(s \u2297 f ) \u2297 \u03b3 7\u2192 (s)\u03c1( f )\u03c1\u2032 \u03b3 for s \u2208 S, f \u2208 S\u2032 and \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393. Then e\u039be\u2032 \u2243 \u0393 as left S\u2032 -modules. Clearly, Ce \u2243 M \u2295 S\u2032\nas right S\u2032 -modules. Recall that we have proved in Step (1) that u is an isomorphism of S-modules and\n\u2032\n\u2032\nTorSi (M, \u0393) = 0 for any i > 0. It follows that TorSi (Ce, e\u039be\u2032 ) = 0. Then we get the following isomorphisms\nin D(C):\nCe \u2297LS\u2032 e\u039be\u2032 \u2243 Ce \u2297S\u2032 e\u039be\u2032 \u2243 (\u0393, M \u2297S\u2032 \u0393, 1) \u2243 \u039be\u2032 .\nThus \u039be\u2032 \u2208 Tria(Ce), and we have finished the claim that the image of the restriction functor (\u03bb\u03c6 )\u2217 belongs\nto Tria(Ce).\nWith the above preparations, we now can prove that the ring homomorphism \u03bb\u03c6 : C \u2192 \u039b is homological\nif and only if so is the ring homomorphism \u03c1\u2032 : S\u2032 \u2192 \u0393.\nIn fact, this can be concluded from the following commutative diagram of functors between triangulated\ncategories:\ne\u2032 \u039b\u2297\u039b \u2212\n\u2243\n\nD(\u039b)\n\nD(C)\n\n(\u03bb\u03c6 )\u2217 ttt\ntt\ntt\nytt\no\n?_\n\n/ D(\u0393)\n(\u03c1\u2032 )\u2217\n\n(\u03bb\u03c6 )\u2217\n\n\u000f\n\nTria(Ce)\n\neC\u2297C \u2212\n\u2243\n\n\u000f\n\n/ D(S\u2032 ),\n\nwhich implies that (\u03bb\u03c6 )\u2217 is fully faithful if and only if so is (\u03c1\u2032 )\u2217 . It is known that \u03bb\u03c6 : C \u2192 \u039b (respectively,\n\u03c1\u2032 : S\u2032 \u2192 \u0393) is homological if and only if (\u03bb\u03c6 )\u2217 (respectively, (\u03c1\u2032 )\u2217 ) is fully faithful.\nThus, we have proved that \u03bb\u03c0\u2217 : B \u2192 B\u03c0\u2217 is homological if and only if \u03c1\u2032 : S\u2032 \u2192 S \u2294R S\u2032 is homological.\nThis finishes the proof of the first part of Proposition 6.8. Clearly, the second part of Proposition 6.8 follows\ndirectly from Proposition 3.5. \u0003\nUnder all conditions in Corollary 6.6(1), we see that both \u03bb and \u03bb\u03c0\u2217 are homological, and therefore\nLemma 6.8 implies Corollary 6.6(1). However, for an injective homological ring epimorphism \u03bb : R \u2192 S, the\nprojective dimension of R S may not be at most one in general (see the example at the end of Corollary 6.10\nbelow). So, from this point of view, Lemma 6.8 may be regarded as a generalization of Corollary 6.6(1).\nCombining Lemma 6.2 with Proposition 6.8, we get the following criterion for \u03bb\u03c0\u2217 to be homological.\nCorollary 6.9. Let \u03a3 be a set of homomorphisms between finitely generated projective R-modules. Suppose\nthat the universal localization \u03bb\u03a3 : R \u2192 R\u03a3 is an injective homological ring homomorphism. Set S := R\u03a3 and\n\u03bb := \u03bb\u03a3 , and \u0393 := {S\u2032 \u2297R f | f \u2208 \u03a3} . Then the universal localization \u03bb\u03c0\u2217 : B \u2192 B\u03c0\u2217 of B at \u03c0\u2217 is homological\nif and only if the universal localization \u03bb\u2032\u0393 : S\u2032 \u2192 S\u0393\u2032 of S\u2032 at \u0393 is homological. In particular, if one of the\nabove equivalent conditions holds , then there is a recollement of derived module categories:\nx\n\nD(S\u0393\u2032 )\nf\n\nx\n/ D(B)\nf\n\n34\n\n/ D(R) .\n\n\fAs a consequence of Corollary 6.9, we obtain the following result which can be used to show when the\nuniversal localization \u03bb\u03c0\u2217 : B \u2192 B\u03c0\u2217 of B at \u03c0\u2217 in Proposition 6.8 is homological in some special cases.\n\u0012\n\u0013\nD D\nCorollary 6.10. Let C \u2286 D be an extension of rings. Set R :=\nand S := M2 (D). Let \u03bb : R \u2192 S\n0 C\nbe the canonical injective ring homomorphism. Then the universal localization \u03bb\u03c0\u2217 : B \u2192 B\u03c0\u2217 of B at \u03c0\u2217 is\nhomological if and only if the universal localization \u03bb\u03c9\u2217 : E \u2192 E\u03c9\u2217 of E at \u03c9\u2217 is homological, where E :=\nEndC (D \u2295 D/C), and the homomorphism \u03c9\u2217 : HomC (D \u2295 D/C, D) \u2192 HomC (D \u2295 D/C, D/C) of projective\nE-modules is induced by the canonical epimorphism \u03c9 : D \u2192 D/C.\nProof. \u0012Recall that\nmap \u03bc\u0012: R \u2192 S\u2032\u0013is a ring homomorphism (see Lemma6.5(1)).\n\u0013 the right\n\u0012 multiplication\n\u0013\n1 0\n0 0\n0 1\nSet e1 :=\n, e2 :=\nand e12 :=\n\u2208 R. Furthermore, let \u03c6 : Re1 \u2192 Re2 and\n0 0\n0 1\n0 0\n\u03c6\u2032 : S\u2032 (e1 )\u03bc \u2192 S\u2032 (e2 )\u03bc be the right multiplication maps by e12 and (e12 )\u03bc, respectively.\nIt follows from Lemma 6.1 and D \u2294C C = D that the map \u03bb : R \u2192 S is the universal localization of R\nat \u03c6. In particular, \u03bb is a ring epimorphism. Since S \u2243 e1 R \u2295 e1 R as right R-modules, the embedding \u03bb is\nalways homological. Note that S\u2032 \u2297R \u03c6 can be identified with \u03c6\u2032 . By Lemma 6.9, the universal localization\n\u03bb\u03c0\u2217 : B \u2192 B\u03c0\u2217 of B at \u03c0\u2217 is homological if and only if the universal localization \u03bb\u2032\u03c6\u2032 : S\u2032 \u2192 S\u03c6\u2032 \u2032 of S\u2032 at \u03c6\u2032 is\nhomological.\nClearly, R/Re1 R \u2243 C as rings. So, every C-module can be regarded as an R-module. In particular,\nD \u2295 D/C can be seen as an R-module. Further, one can check that the map \u03b1 : D \u2295 D/C \u2192 S/R defined by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 0\n(d,t +C) 7\u2192\n+R\nd t\nfor d,t \u2208 D, is an isomorphism of R-modules. Thus S\u2032 \u2243 E, \u03c6\u2032 corresponds to \u03c9\u2217 under this isomorphism,\nand therefore S\u03c6\u2032 \u2032 \u2243 E\u03c9\u2217 . It follows that \u03bb\u2032\u03c6\u2032 : S\u2032 \u2192 S\u03c6\u2032 \u2032 is homological if and only if so is \u03bb\u03c9\u2217 : E \u2192 E\u03c9\u2217 . This\nfinishes the proof. \u0003\nRemark. In general, the special form of the universal localization \u03bb\u03c9\u2217 : E \u2192 E\u03c9\u2217 of E at \u03c9\u2217 (or equivalently, the universal localization \u03bb\u03c0\u2217 : B \u2192 B\u03c0\u2217 of B at \u03c0\u2217 ) in Corollary 6.10 may not be homological, through\nthe \u03bb is always homological.\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\b a 0\nk 0\nFor example, let C =\n| a, b \u2208 k and D =\nwith k a field. Then one can check\nb a\nk k\nthat the canonical map \u03c9 : D \u2192 D/C is a split epimorphism in C-Mod, and therefore C D \u2243 C \u2295 D/C. Let\ne be the idempotent of E corresponding the direct summand C of the C-module D \u2295 D/C. Then E\u03c9\u2217 \u2243\nE/EeE \u2243 M2 (k). Furthermore, the universal localization \u03bb\u03c9\u2217 : E \u2192 E\u03c9\u2217 of E at \u03c9\u2217 is equivalent to the\ncanonical projection \u03c4 : E \u2192 E/EeE. Since Ext2E (E/EeE, E/EeE) 6= 0, we see that \u03c4 is not homological.\nThis implies that \u03bb\u03c9\u2217 is not homological, too. Thus \u03bb\u03c0\u2217 : B \u2192 B\u03c0\u2217 is not homological by Corollary 6.10, that\nis, the restriction functor (\u03bb\u03c0\u2217 )\u2217 : D(B\u03c0\u2217 ) \u2192 D(B) is not fully faithful.\n\n7 Commutative rings and recollements of derived module categories\nIn this section, we shall first discuss recollements of derived module categories arising from injective homological ring epimorphisms \u03bb : R \u2192 S between arbitrary commutative rings without the assumption that the\nmodules S \u2295 S/R are tilting modules, and then turn to the special case of one-Gorenstein rings. We shall see\nthat, for commutative rings, the universal localizations appearing in the main result Theorem 1.1 will be further strengthened as tensor products. As a consequence, we can produce examples to show that two different\n35\n\n\fstratifications of a derived module category by derived module categories of rings may have different derived\ncomposition factors, which answers negatively a question in [4] and shows that the Jordan-H\u00f6lder theorem\nfails for derived module categories with simple derived module categories as composition factors.\nNote that if R is a commutative ring and \u03bb : R \u2192 S is a ring epimorphism, then S must be commutative.\nSo, in the following, we can assume that both rings R and S are commutative rings.\n\n7.1 General case: Arbitrary commutative rings\nThe main purpose of this subsection is to prove the following existence result for recollements arising form\ninjective ring epimorphisms between commutative rings. Here we remove the condition of tilting modules.\nProposition 7.1. Suppose that \u03bb : R \u2192 S is an injective homological ring epimorphism between commutative\nrings R and S. Let B be the endomorphism ring of the R-module S \u2295 S/R. Then there is a recollement of\nderived module categories:\nw\n\nD(S \u2297R S\u2032 )\ng\n\nx\n/ D(B)\nf\n\n/ D(R) ,\n\nwhere S\u2032 := EndR (S/R) is commutative, and S \u2297R S\u2032 is the tensor product of S and S\u2032 over R.\nIn particular, the left global dimension of B is finite if and only the left global dimensions of R and S \u2297R S\u2032\nboth are finite.\nProof. Since S is a commutative ring, we see that S\u2032 is an R-algebra via the right multiplication map\n\u03bc : R \u2192 S\u2032 , defined by r 7\u2192 (x 7\u2192 xr) for r \u2208 R and x \u2208 S/R (see Lemma 6.5(1)). Then the tensor product\nS \u2297R S\u2032 of S and S\u2032 over R makes sense. Moreover, the map \u03bb\u2032 : S\u2032 \u2192 S \u2297R S\u2032 , defined by s\u2032 7\u2192 1 \u2297 s\u2032 for any\ns\u2032 \u2208 S\u2032 , and the map \u03bc\u2032 : S \u2192 S \u2297R S\u2032 , defined by s 7\u2192 s \u2297 1 for s \u2208 S, are ring homomorphisms. So, S \u2297R S\u2032 is\nan S\u2032 -S\u2032 -bimodule via \u03bb\u2032 . In addition, it follows from Lemma 6.5(5) that S\u2032 is a commutative ring.\nSince \u03bb is a ring epimorphism, we know from Lemma 6.3 that the tensor product S \u2297R S\u2032 together with\nthe two ring homomorphisms \u03bb\u2032 and \u03bc\u2032 satisfies the definition of coproducts. In other words, the coproduct\nS \u2294R S\u2032 of R-rings S and S\u2032 over R is isomorphic to the tensor product S \u2297R S\u2032 .\nBy Proposition 6.8, to get the recollement of derived module categories in Proposition 7.1, it is sufficient\nto demonstrate that \u03bb\u2032 : S\u2032 \u2192 S \u2297R S\u2032 is homological.\nIn fact, we have the following composition of a series of isomorphisms of S-S\u2032 bimodules:\n\u0001\n(S \u2297R S\u2032 ) \u2297S\u2032 (S \u2297R S\u2032 ) \u2243 S \u2297R S\u2032 \u2297S\u2032 (S \u2297R S\u2032 ) \u2243 S \u2297R (S \u2297R S\u2032 ) \u2243 (S \u2297R S) \u2297R S\u2032 \u2243 S \u2297R S\u2032 .\nThis composition map is actually the multiplication map from (S \u2297R S\u2032 ) \u2297S\u2032 (S \u2297R S\u2032 ) to S \u2297R S\u2032 . Thus it is an\n(S \u2297R S\u2032 )-(S \u2297R S\u2032 )-bimodule isomorphism. Hence \u03bb\u2032 is a ring epimorphism.\n\u2032\nIt remains to show TorSi (S \u2297R S\u2032 , S \u2297R S\u2032 ) = 0 for all i > 0. However, this follows immediately from Step\n(1) in the proof of Proposition 6.8. Thus, we finish the proof of Proposition 7.1.\nThe last statement follows from a result in [24]. \u0003\n\n7.2 Special case: One-Gorenstein rings\nThroughout this subsection, R will stand for a commutative ring. We denote by Spec(R) (respectively,\nmSpec(R) ) the set of all prime (respectively, maximal) ideals of R. For each non-negative integer i, we\ndenote by Pi the set of all prime ideals of R with height i.\nLet M be an R-module. We denote by E(M) the injective envelope of M, and by proj.dim(M), inj.dim(M)\nand flat.dim(M) the projective, injective and flat dimensions of R M, respectively.\nFor a multiplication subset \u03a3 of R, we denote by \u03a3\u22121 R the localization of R at \u03a3, and by f\u03a3 : R \u2192 \u03a3\u22121 R the\ncanonical homological ring epimorphism. In general, the homomorphism f\u03a3 is not injective. But, if \u03a6 is the\n36\n\n\fmultiplicative set of all non-zero divisors of R, then the localization map f\u03a6 : R \u2192 \u03a6\u22121 R is always injective.\nIn this case, the ring \u03a6\u22121 R is called the total quotient ring of R, denoted by Q. In fact, Q is the largest\nlocalization of R for which the canonical map is injective, that is, if the map f\u03a3 : R \u2192 \u03a3\u22121 R is injective, then\n\u03a3 \u2286 \u03a6, and there is a unique injective ring homomorphism h : \u03a3\u22121 R \u2192 Q such that f\u03a6 = f\u03a3 h. In addition, if\nR is noetherian, then P0 is finite and \u03a6 = R \\ \u222ap\u2208P0 p.\nAs usual, for a prime ideal p of R, we always write Rp for (R \\ p)\u22121 R, and fp for fR\\p , and say that Rp is\nthe localization of R at p.\nNote that the localization Zp of Z at the maximal ideal p = pZ is Q(p) for every prime p \u2208 N, where Q(p)\nis the set of p-integers. Recall that q = n/m \u2208 Q with m, n \u2208 Z is called a p-integer if p does not divide m.\nLet p1 , * * * , pn be prime ideals in R, and set \u03a3 := R \\ \u222ani=1 pi . Then \u03a3 = \u2229ni=1 (R \\ pi ) is a multiplicative\nsubset of R, and the prime ideals of the localization \u03a3\u22121 R are in one-to one correspondence with the prime\n/ that is, with the prime ideals of R contained in \u222ani=1 Pi . By prime avoidance\nideals p of R with p \u2229 \u03a3 = 0,\ntheorem, any such prime ideal is contained in one of the pi . Hence, {\u03a3\u22121 p j | 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n} contains the maximal\nideals of \u03a3\u22121 R. If all pi are pairwise incomparable, that is pi 6\u2286 p j for i 6= j, then this is exactly the set of all\nmaximal ideals of \u03a3\u22121 R.\nNow, let us mention the following homological results about commutative noetherian rings, which are\nneeded for our discussions in this section. For more details, we refer the reader, for instance, to [22, Theorem\n3.3.8, Theorem 3.4.1, Lemma 6.7.7] and [32, Corollary 11.2].\nLemma 7.2. Suppose that R is a noetherian ring. Let p, q \u2208 Spec(R). We define Jp := limi R/pi . Then the\n\u2190\u2212\nfollowing hold:\n(1) HomR (E(R/p), E(R/q)) 6= 0 if and only if p \u2286 q. In particular, E(R/p) \u2243 E(R/q) if and only if p = q.\n(2) If \u03a3 is a multiplication subset of R, then, as R-modules,\n\u001a\n/\nE(R/p) if \u03a3 \u2229 p = 0,\n\u22121\n\u03a3 E(R/p) \u2243\n/\n0\nif \u03a3 \u2229 p 6= 0.\n(3) If p is a maximal ideal of R, then\nEndR (E(R/p)) \u2243 lim Rp /pi Rp \u2243 Jp .\n\u2190\u2212\ni\n\n(4) Let P be a set of maximal ideals of R. If q is a maximal ideal of R, which does not belong to P, then\nE(R/q) \u2297R \u220f Jp = 0.\np\u2208P\n\n(5) Define Sn := {x \u2208 E(R/p) | pn x = 0} for each n > 0. Then E(R/p) = \u222an Sn .\nOf our interest is the class of n-Gorenstein rings. Recall that, for a non-negative integer n, the ring R\nis called n-Gorenstein if R is noetherian and inj.dim(R) \u2264 n. The following homological properties of nGorenstein rings are well-known, for their proofs, we refer to [7, Theorem 1, Theorem 6.2], [22, Theorem\n9.1.10, Theorem 9.1.11] and [38, Introduction].\nLemma 7.3. Let n be a non-negative integer. Assume that R is an n-Gorenstein ring.\n(1) The regular module R has a minimal injective resolution of the form:\n0 \u2212\u2192 R \u2212\u2192\n\nM\n\nE(R/p) \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2212\u2192\n\np\u2208P0\n\nM\n\nE(R/p) \u2212\u2192 0.\n\np\u2208Pn\n\nMoreover, the total quotient ring Q of R is isomorphic to E(R) as an R-module.\n\n37\n\n\f(2) Let M be an R-module. Then the following are equivalent:\n(i) proj.dim(M) < \u221e;\n(iv) proj.dim(M) \u2264 n;\n\n(ii)\n(v)\n\ninj.dim(M) < \u221e;\ninj.dim(M) \u2264 n;\n\n(3) The R-module\nT(Pn ) :=\n\nMM\n\n(iii)\n(vi)\n\nflat.dim(M) < \u221e;\nflat.dim(M) \u2264 n.\n\nE(R/p)\n\ni\u2264n p\u2208Pi\n\nis an (infinitely generated) n-tilting module, that is, it is of projective dimension at most n, and satisfies (T2)\nand (T3) (replaced by a longer exact sequence) in Definition 4.1.\n(4) If \u03a3 is a multiplication subset of R, then \u03a3\u22121 R is an n-Gorenstein ring.\nFrom now on, we assume that R is a 1-Gorenstein ring. Then P1 consists of all maximal ideals of R\nwhich are not minimal prime ideals. By Lemma 7.3, one gets a tilting R-module T(P1 ) of projective dimension\nat most one. This construction of tilting modules from 1-Gorenstein rings can be generalized to obtain the\nso-called Bass tilting modules, as mentioned in [2]. Now, let us recall the construction.\nLet\nf\u03a6\n\u03c0 M\n0 \u2212\u2192 R \u2212\u2192 Q \u2212\u2192\nE(R/p) \u2212\u2192 0,\np\u2208P1\n\nbe a minimal injective resolution of R, where \u03c0 is the canonical surjective map which is regarded as a homomorphism of R-modules. Let \u2206 be a subset of P1 . Then we define\nM\n\nR(\u2206) := \u03c0\u22121 (\n\nE(R/p)) and\n\nT(\u2206) := R(\u2206) \u2295\n\nM\n\nE(R/p).\n\np\u2208\u2206\n\np\u2208\u2206\n\nClearly, we get two associated exact sequences of R-modules\n(a)\n\n\u03c0\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 R \u2212\u2192 R(\u2206) \u2212\u2192\n\nM\n\nE(R/p) \u2212\u2192 0 ;\n\np\u2208\u2206\n\n(b)\n\nM\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 R(\u2206) \u2212\u2192 Q \u2212\u2192\n\nE(R/p) \u2212\u2192 0.\n\np\u2208P1 \\\u2206\n\nNote that R(\u2206) is just an R-submodule of Q. It is shown in [2, Section 4] that the R-module T(\u2206) is a tilting\nmodule, which is called a Bass tilting module over R. Further, the authors of [38] prove that every tilting\nmodule over R is equivalent to a Bass tilting module. Note that the sequence (a) implies that the R-tilting\nmodule T(\u2206) is good.\nThe next lemma describes some properties relevant to Bass tilting modules. Note that the conclusions (1)\nand (2) of Lemma 7.4 below are mentioned in [37] for Dedekind domains.\nLemma 7.4. let \u2206 be a subset of P1 . Assume that each prime ideal belonging to the set P1 \\ \u2206 contains all\nzero divisors of R. Then we have the following:\n(1) For each p \u2208 P1 \\ \u2206, the canonical ring homomorphism fp : R \u2192 Rp is injective.\nT\n(2) R(\u2206) = p\u2208P1 \\\u2206 Rp , which is a flat R-module, where Rp is regarded as a subring of the total ring Q of\nR. Hence R(\u2206) can be regarded as a subring of Q containing R. In particular, the total quotient ring of R(\u2206)\nT\nalso equals Q. (Note that we set p\u22080/ Rp = Q.)\n(3) The canonical inclusions \u03bb\u2206 : R \u2192 R(\u2206) and \u03bc\u2206 : R(\u2206) \u2192 Q are homological ring epimorphisms.\n(4) The R(\u2206) -module\nM\n\u2032\nT(\u2206)\n:= Q \u2295\nE(R/p)\np\u2208P1 \\\u2206\n\nis a good tilting R(\u2206) -module.

(1) Note that, for each r \u2208 Ker( fp ), there exists an element x \u2208 R \\ p such that rx = 0. Since p\ncontains all zero divisors of R, we know that x is non-zero divisor of R. This implies r = 0, and so the map\nfp is injective.\n(2) Let q \u2208 P1 \\ \u2206. Since the localization map fq : R \u2192 Rq is injective by (1), there is a unique injective\nhomomorphism \u03bcq : Rq \u2192 Q such that f\u03a6 = fq \u03bc by the universal property of the total quotient ring of R. So,\nwe can think of Rq as a subring of Q. Under this identification, we can speak of the intersection of Rp defined\nin (2).\nFirst, we show that if \u2206 = P1 \\ {p} for some p \u2208 P1 , then R(\u2206) = Rp . By Lemma 7.3(1), we have the\nfollowing exact commutative diagram:\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n/R\n\nfp\n\n\u000f\n/ Rp\n\nf\u03a6\n\n\u000f\n\n\u03bcp \u03c0\n\n\u000f\n/Y\n\n/0\n\n\u03bcp\n\n0\n\n/R\n\n/Q\n\n\u03c0\n\n/\n\nL\n\n\u000f\n\nq\u2208P1 E(R/q)\n\n/ 0.\n\n(gq )q\u2208P1\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n\nE(R/p)\n\nE(R/p)\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n\n0\n\n0\n\nwhere Y denotes the image of the restriction of \u03c0 to Rp , and where gq : E(R/q) \u2192 E(R/p) is a homomorphism\nof R-modules. Clearly, the localization Yp of Y at p is zero. Let a \u2208 \u2206. By Lemma 7.2(1), we know that\nHomR (E(R/a), E(R/p)) = 0 since both a and p are maximal ideals of R. Consequently, ga = 0 and Y =\nL\nKer(gp ) \u2295 q\u2208\u2206 E(R/q), where g = gp : E(R/p) \u2192 E(R/p) is a surjective homomorphism of R-modules. We\nclaim Ker(g) = 0. In fact, by Lemma 7.2(2), we know that E(R/p)) \u2243 (E(R/p))p as R-modules. This implies\nthat Ker(g) \u2243 Ker(g)p as R-modules. Then it follows from Yp = 0 that Ker(g)p = 0. Thus Rp = R(\u2206) under\nour identification of Rp in Q.\n39\n\n\fSecond, in the general case, we observe that\n\\\n\n\u2206=\n\n(P1 \\ {b}) and\n\nb\u2208P1 \\\u2206\n\nThus\nR(\u2206) = \u03c0\n\n\u22121\n\nM\np\u2208\u2206\n\nM\n\n\u0012\n\n(\n\nM\n\nE(R/q) ).\n\nb\u2208P1 \\\u2206 q\u2208P1 \\{b}\n\np\u2208\u2206\n\n\u0001\nE(R/p) = \u03c0\u22121\n\n\\\n\nE(R/p) =\n\n\\\n\nM\n\nb\u2208P1 \\\u2206\n\nq\u2208P1 \\{b}\n\n\u0013\n\\\n\u0001\nE(R/q) =\nRp .\np\u2208P1 \\\u2206\n\nThird, to prove that R(\u2206) is a flat R-module, we use the exact sequence (b). Since R is noetherian, the\nL\narbitrary direct sum of injective R-modules is injective. Thus p\u2208P1 \\\u2206 E(R/p) is injective. Note that R Q is\nflat. By Lemma 7.3(2), we deduce that R(\u2206) is a flat R-module.\nFinally, note that the total quotient ring of R(\u2206) also equals Q.\n(3) Recall that Q is the localization of R at the multiplication set \u03a6 consisting of all non-zero divisors of\nR. Clearly, the map f\u03a6 : R \u2192 Q is a ring epimorphism. Note that Q and R(\u2206) are flat R-modules. It follows\nfrom Lemma 2.3 that both \u03bb\u2206 and \u03bc\u2206 are homological ring epimorphisms.\n\u2032 . Note that the R -module W is injective as an R-modules. Since\n(4) For simplicity, we set W := T(\u2206)\n(\u2206)\n\u03bb\u2206 is a homological ring epimorphism, it follows from Lemma 2.2 that W is an injective R(\u2206)-module. In\nparticular, the regular module R(\u2206) has injective dimension at most 1. If R(\u2206) is noetherian, then R(\u2206) is 1Gorenstein by definition. In this case, it directly follows from [2, Section 4] that the module W is a tilting\nR(\u2206) -module. However, in general, we do not know whether R(\u2206) is noetherian or not. Because of this reason,\nwe have to prove, in the following, that W is a tilting R(\u2206) -module. Indeed, since W is an injective R-module\nand R is 1-Gorenstein, we know from Lemma 7.3(2) that proj.dim(RW ) \u2264 1. Note that \u03bb\u2206 is a homological\nring epimorphism. It follows from Lemma 2.2 that proj.dim(R(\u2206) W ) \u2264 proj.dim(RW ) \u2264 1. Clearly, the module\nW satisfies the condition (T3 ) in Definition 4.1. To see that W satisfies the condition (T2 ) in Definition 4.1,\nwe observe that\nExtiR(\u2206) (W,W (\u03b1) ) \u2243 ExtiR (W,W (\u03b1) ) = 0\nfor every i \u2265 1 and every cardinal \u03b1, where the first isomorphism follows from Lemma 2.2(3), and the second\nequality follows from the fact that every direct sum of injective R-modules is injective since R is noetherian.\nThus W is a tilting R(\u2206) -module. Clearly, the exact sequence (b) implies that W is a good tilting.\nL\n(5) By Lemma 7.2(1) and Lemma 7.2(3), we\nhave J\u2206 \u2243 EndR ( p\u2208\u2206 E(R/p)) \u2243 \u220fp\u2208\u2206 Jp . According to\n\u0001\nL\nLemma 6.5, we have HomR R(\u2206) , p\u2208\u2206 E(R/p \u2243 R(\u2206) \u2297R J\u2206 as R(\u2206) -J\u2206 -bimodules. Now, (5) follows from\nLemma 6.4(2) immediately.\n(6) We first observe that\nHomR (X ,Y ) \u2243 HomR(\u2206) (X ,Y ) and\n\nX \u2297R Y \u2243 X \u2297R(\u2206) Y\n\nfor any R(\u2206) -modules X and Y since \u03bb\u2206 : R \u2192 R(\u2206) is a ring epimorphism, and then use Lemma 6.4(2), Lemma\n6.5 and Lemma 7.2. We omit the details here.\n(7) Note that if R is a commutative noetherian ring and if I is an ideal of R, then (i) the I-adic completion\nof R is a flat R-module, and (ii) the product of flat R-modules is flat (see [22, Corollary 2.5.15, Theorem\n3.2.24]). Hnece J\u2206 is a flat R-module. In order to prove that \u03bc\u2206 \u2297R J\u2206 : R(\u2206) \u2297R J\u2206 \u2192 Q \u2297R J\u2206 is an isomorL\nphism, it is sufficient to show ( p\u2208P1 \\\u2206 E(R/p)) \u2297R J\u2206 = 0. This is equivalent to E(R/p) \u2297R J\u2206 = 0 for any\np \u2208 P1 \\ \u2206. However, the latter is a direct consequence of Lemma 7.2(4).\n(8) Clearly, the map \u0398P is a ring homomorphism. Applying the tensor functors \u2212 \u2297R \u220fp\u2208P Jp and \u2212 \u2297R Jp\nto the minimal injective coresolution of R, respectively, we can get the following exact commutative diagram\n\n40\n\n\fof R-modules:\n0\n\n/ R \u2297R \u220fp\u2208P Jp\n\n/ Q \u2297R \u220fp\u2208P Jp\n\n\u0001\n\nq\u2208P1 E(R/q)\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n\n/ \u220fp\u2208P R \u2297R Jp\n\n\u2297R \u220fp\u2208P Jp\n\n/0\n\n\u0398\u2032P\n\n\u0398P\n\n\u2240\n\n0\n\nL\n\n/\n\n/ \u220fp\u2208P Q \u2297R Jp\n\n/\u220f\np\u2208P\n\n\u000f\n\nL\n\n\u0001\n\nq\u2208P1 E(R/q)\n\n\u2297R Jp\n\n/ 0,\n\nwhere we define the homomorphism \u0398\u2032P of R-modules in the same way as we did for \u0398P . We claim that \u0398\u2032P\nis injective. In fact, since tensor functor commutes with direct sums, it follows from Lemma 7.2(4) that we\ncan embed \u0398\u2032P into the following commutative diagram:\nL\n\n\u0001\n\nq\u2208P1 E(R/q)\n\n\u223c\n\n\u2297R \u220fp\u2208P Jp\n\n/\n\nL\n\np\u2208P E(R/p) \u2297R Jp\n\n\u0398\u2032P\n\n\u220fp\u2208P\n\nL\n\n\u03bb\n\n\u000f\n\n\u0001\nq\u2208P1 E(R/q) \u2297R Jp\n\n\u223c\n\n\u000f\n\n/ \u220fp\u2208P E(R/p) \u2297R Jp ,\n\nwhere the map \u03bb is the canonical inclusion. This shows that \u0398\u2032P is injective, which implies that \u0398P also is\ninjective. \u0003\nNote that if R is a local ring or a domain, then the assumption in Lemma 7.4 holds. It is well-known that\nDedekind domains are 1-Gorenstein rings. Recall that a commutative ring R is called a Dedekind domain if\nR is a domain in which every ideal (6= R) is the product of a finite numbers of prime ideals. This is equivalent\nto saying that Rp is a discrete valuation ring for each prime ideal p of R. A typical example of Dedekind\ndomain is the ring Z of rational integers.\nThe assumption of Lemma 7.4 cannot be droped for (1) to hold true. For example, if R is a local 1Gorenstein ring, then the direct sum S := R \u2295 R of two copies of R is again 1-Gorenstein. If we take m to be\nthe unique maximal ideal of R, then the localization of S at the maximal ideal p := (m, R) is isomorphic to\nRm . This shows that the localization map S \u2192 Sp is not injective.\nBy Lemma 7.4(2), we know that R(\u2206) is always an intersection of localizations. But, in general, it may\nnot be a localization of R at any multiplication set. For a counterexample, we refer the reader to [33]. A\nnatural question arises: when is R(\u2206) itself a localization of R at some multiplication set ? The following\nresult provides some partial answers to this question.\nLemma 7.5. Let \u2206 be a subset of P1 . Assume that each prime ideal belonging to P1 \\ \u2206 contains all zero\nS\nS\ndivisors of R. Define \u03a3 := R \\ q\u2208P1 \\\u2206 q and \u22061 := {a \u2208 P1 | a \u2286 q\u2208P1 \\\u2206 q}. Then we have the following:\n\u0001\nL\n(1) \u03a3\u22121 R = \u03c0\u22121\np\u2208P1 \\\u22061 E(R/p) \u2286 R(\u2206) \u2286 Q.\n\u22121\n(2) R(\u2206) = \u03a31 R for some multiplication subset \u03a31 of R if and only if R(\u2206) = \u03a3\u22121 R if and only if \u22061 = P1 \\\u2206.\n(3) If P1 \\ \u2206 is a finite set, or if each ideal in \u2206 is a principal ideal of R, then R(\u2206) = \u03a3\u22121 R.\nProof. (1) Clearly, we have \u03a3 \u2286 \u03a6 and \u03a3 is a multiplicative set. Thus the canonical map f\u03a3 : R \u2192 \u03a3\u22121 R is\ninjective, and there is a unique injective ring homomorphism h : \u03a3\u22121 R \u2192 Q such that f\u03a6 = f\u03a3 h. In this sense,\nwe may regard \u03a3\u22121 R as a subring of the total quotient ring Q containing R. Moreover, the total quotient\nring of \u03a3\u22121 R equals Q. Since R is a 1-Gorenstein ring, it follows from Lemma 7.3(4) that \u03a3\u22121 R also is a 1Gorenstein ring. In addition, it follows from standard commutative algebra that the map \u03c6 : \u22061 \u2192 Spec(\u03a3\u22121 R)\nsending q to \u03a3\u22121 q for q \u2208 \u22061 is a bijection. This shows that we can have the following exact sequence of\nR-modules:\nM\nh\nE(R/q) \u2212\u2192 0.\n0 \u2212\u2192 R\u03a3 \u2212\u2192 Q \u2212\u2192\nq\u2208\u22061\n\n41\n\n\fBy Lemma 7.3, we can further form the following exact commutative diagram of R-modules:\n0\n\n0\n\n/R\n\n0\n\n\u000f\n/ \u03a3\u22121 R\n\nf\u03a3\n\n\u000f\n/ Y\u2032\n\nh\u03c0\n\n/0\n\nh\n\n0\n\n/R\n\n\u000f\n\nf\u03a6\n\n/Q\n\n\u03c0\n\n/\n\nL\n\n\u000f\n\nq\u2208P1 E(R/q)\n\n/ 0,\n\n(g\u2032q )q\u2208P1\n\nL\n\nL\n\n\u000f\n\nq\u2208\u22061 E(R/q)\n\n\u000f\n\nq\u2208\u22061 E(R/q)\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n\n0\n\n0\nL\n\nwhere Y \u2032 denotes the image of h\u03c0, and where g\u2032q : E(R/q) \u2192 q\u2208\u22061 E(R/q) is a homomorphism of RL\nmodules. By the same argument as in the proof of Lemma 7.4(2), we can prove Y \u2032 = p\u2208P1 \\\u22061 E(R/p).\nL\nThus \u03a3\u22121 R = \u03c0\u22121 ( p\u2208P1 \\\u22061 E(R/p)). By definition, we have P1 \\ \u2206 \u2286 \u22061 , and so \u03a3\u22121 R \u2286 R(\u2206) .\n(2) It follows from the definition of R(\u2206) and the statement (1) that R(\u2206) = \u03a3\u22121 R if and only if \u22061 = P1 \\ \u2206.\nTo prove the statement (2), it suffices to show that if R(\u2206) = \u03a3\u22121\n1 R for some multiplication subset \u03a31 of R,\n\u22121\n\u22121\nthen R(\u2206) = \u03a3 R. Now, assume R(\u2206) = \u03a31 R. By Lemma 7.3(4), R(\u2206) is a 1-Gorenstein ring. Note that\nL\nQ/R(\u2206) \u2243 p\u2208P1 \\\u2206 E(R/p) as R-modules. Then it follows from Lemma 7.3(1) and Lemma 7.2(2) that, for\nS\nT\n/ and so \u03a31 \u2286 R\\p. Since \u03a3 := R\\ q\u2208P1 \\\u2206 q = q\u2208P1 \\\u2206 R\\q, we have \u03a31 \u2286 \u03a3,\nany p \u2208 P1 \\ \u2206, we have p\u2229\u03a31 = 0,\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\nand so R(\u2206) = \u03a3\u22121\n1 R \u2286 \u03a3 R. Thanks to the statement (1), we get \u03a3 R \u2286 R(\u2206) \u2286 Q. Thus R(\u2206) = \u03a3 R.\n(3) It suffices to show \u22061 = P1 \\ \u2206. Clearly, we have P1 \\ \u2206 \u2286 \u22061 by definition. Now we show \u22061 \u2286 P1 \\ \u2206.\nS\nIn fact, if a \u2208 \u22061 , then a \u2286 q\u2208P1 \\\u2206 q. Thus,\nif, in addition, P1 \\ \u2206 is finite, then a \u2286 q1 for some q1 \u2208 P1 \\ \u2206 by prime avoidance theorem. Since a is a\nmaximal ideal of R, it follows that a = q1 . Hence \u22061 = P1 \\ \u2206.\nIf we assume that each ideal in \u2206 is principal, then a must be in P1 \\ \u2206. If it is not the case, then a \u2208 \u2206,\nS\nand so there exists an r \u2208 R such that a = Rr. Since a \u2286 q\u2208P1 \\\u2206 q, we know that r \u2208 q for some q \u2208 P1 \\ \u2206,\nand so a \u2286 q. By the maximality of a, we have a = q. This is impossible because the intersection of \u2206 and\nP1 \\ \u2206 is empty. Hence \u22061 = P1 \\ \u2206. By (2), we have R(\u2206) = \u03a3\u22121 R for either case. \u0003\nCombining Corollary 6.6(1) and Lemma 6.3 with Lemma 7.4(7), we have the following result on recollements of derived module categories of endomorphism rings.\nProposition 7.6. Let R be a 1-Gorenstein ring, and let \u2206 be a subset of P1 . Assume that each prime ideal in\nP1 \\ \u2206 contains all zero divisors of R. Then we get the following recollements of derived module categories:\nv\n\nD(Q \u2297R J\u2206 )\nh\n\nv\n\nD(Q \u2297R J\u2206\u2032 )\nh\n\nx\n/ D(B\u2206 )\nf\nw\n/ D(B\u2032 )\n\u2206 g\n\n/ D(R) ,\n/ D(R(\u2206) ) .\n\nProof. Here we provide another proof. We consider the injective homological ring epimorphism \u03bb\u2206 :\nR \u2192 R(\u2206) defined in Lemma 7.4(3). Then, we have R(\u2206) \u2297R J\u2206 \u2243 Q \u2297R J\u2206 by Lemma 7.4(7). Now, the first\nrecollement in Proposition 7.6 follows immediately from Proposition 7.1.\n42\n\n\fThe proof of the existence of the second recollement in Proposition 7.6 can be implemented similarly as\nwe did for the first one. \u0003\nIn the rest of this subsection, we consider the ring Z, it is a Dedekind domain and, of course, a 1Gorenstein ring. Clearly, it fulfills the assumption of Proposition 7.6. In this case, we can have a more\nexplicit formulation for Proposition 7.6. Our discussion below uses some basic results on p-adic numbers in\nalgebraic number theory.\ni\nFix a prime number p \u2265 2. A p-adic integer is a formal infinite series \u2211\u221e\ni=0 ai p , where 0 \u2264 ai < p for all\n\u221e\nj\ni \u2265 0. A p-adic number is a formal infinite series of the form \u2211 j=\u2212m a j p , where m \u2208 Z and 0 \u2264 a j < p for\nall j \u2265 \u2212m. The sets of all p-adic integers and p-adic numbers are denoted by Z p and Q p , respectively. Note\nthat Z p is a discrete valuation ring of global dimension 1 with the unique maximal ideal pZ p , and that Q p is\na field.\nIf f \u2208 Q is a rational number, then we can write\nf=\n\ng \u2212m\np\nh\n\ng, h \u2208 Z, (gh, p) = 1.\n\nwhere\n\nSince the rational number gh always belongs to Z p , that is, there are 0 \u2264 ai < p for all i \u2265 0 such that\ng\n\u221e\ni\nh = \u2211i=0 ai p . Consequently, we have\n\u221e\n\nf = \u2211 ai p\u2212m+i \u2208 Q p .\ni=0\n\nIn this way, we can regard Q as a subfield of Q p . This implies that, for f \u2208 Q, there are at most finitely\nmany prime numbers q such that f \u2208 Qq \\ Zq , or equivalently, f \u2208 Zq for almost all prime number q. It is\nwell-known that Q \u2297Z Z p \u2243 Q p by multiplication map since Q p = {pm y | m \u2208 Z, y \u2208 Z}. Clearly, Q \u2282 Q p\nand Z \u2282 Q(p) \u2282 Z p \u2282 Q p for every prime p \u2208 N := {0, 1, 2, * * * }. It is known that EndZ (Q/Z) \u2243 \u220f p Z p as\nrings, where p goes through all prime numbers.\nAn alternative definition of Z p is that Z p is the p-adic completion limi Z/pi Z of Z. Another algebraic\n\u2190\u2212\ndefinition of Z p is that Z p is isomorphic to the quotient of the formal power series ring Z[[X ]] by the ideal\ngenerated by X \u2212 p. Note that Q p is the field of fractions of Z p . For more details about p-adic numbers, one\nb the product \u220f p Z p of all Z p with p positive prime\nmay refer to [32, Chapter IV, Section 2]. We denote by Z\nnumbers. This is a commutative ring.\nNow, let \u039b be the set of all prime numbers in N, and let I be a subset of \u039b. Set I \u2032 := \u039b \\ I, \u2206 := {p | p \u2208 I}\nand Z(I) := Z(\u2206) .\nLemma 7.7. The following statements hold true for the ring Z of integers.\n(1) Let \u03a3 := Z \\ \u222aq\u2208I \u2032 q. Then Z(I) = \u03a3\u22121 Z, which is the smallest subring of Q containing\n(2)The injective ring homomorphism\n\n1\np\n\nfor all p \u2208 I.\n\n\u0398I : Q \u2297Z \u220f Z p \u2212\u2192 \u220f Q p\np\u2208I\n\np\u2208I\n\ndefined by q \u2297 (x p ) p\u2208I 7\u2192 (qx p ) p\u2208I for q \u2208 Q and x p \u2208 Z p satisfies that\n\b\nIm(\u0398I ) = AI := (y p ) p\u2208I \u2208 \u220f Q p | y p \u2208 Z p for almost all p \u2208 I .\np\u2208I\n\nIn particular, if I is a finite set, then Im(\u0398I ) = AI = \u220f p\u2208I Q p . Note that AI is a kind of ad\u00e9le in global class\nfield theory (see [32, Chapter VI]).\n(3) There are the following ring isomorphisms:\nQ \u2297Z \u220f Z p \u2243 AI ,\n\nQ \u2297Z \u220f Z p \u2243 AI \u2032 .\np\u2208I \u2032\n\np\u2208I\n\n43\n\n\fProof. (1) Let q \u2208 I \u2032 . By Lemma 7.4(2), we have Z(I) =\nwith q = qZ.

Moreover, for such f \u2208 Q, there are at most finitely many\nprime numbers q such that f \u2208 Qq \\ Zq . In other words, f \u2208 Zq for almost all prime number q. This implies\nIm(\u0398I ) = AI .\n(3) This follows from (2). \u0003\nWith help of Lemma 7.7, we can state Proposition 7.6 for R = Z more explicitly.\nCorollary 7.8. We have the following recollements of derived module categories:\nx\n\nx\n/ D(BI )\nf\n\nD(AI )\nf\n\nw\n/ D(B\u2032 )\nI g\n\nw\n\nD(AI \u2032 )\ng\n\n/ D(Z) ,\n\n/ D(Z(I) ) ,\n\nwhere BI := EndZ (Z(I) \u2295 Z(I) /Z) and B\u2032I := EndZ(I) (Q \u2295 Q/Z(I) ).\n\n7.3 Examples\nIn the following we shall exploit Corollary 7.8 to give a couple of examples of derived module categories that\nhave two different stratifications by derived module categories of rings with different composition factors.\nThis is related to the following problem proposed in [4]:\nProblem: Given a ring R, do all stratifications of D(R) by derived module categories of rings have the\nsame finite number of factors, and are these factors the same for all stratifications, up to ordering and up to\nderived equivalence?\nA negative partial solution to this problem can be seen from Examples 7.9 and 7.10 below.\nLet us first recall the definition of a stratification of D(R) for R a ring in [4].\nLet R be a ring. If there are rings R1 and R2 such that a recollement\n(\u2217)\n\nx\n\nD(R1 )\nf\n\nx\n/ D(R)\nf\n\n/ D(R2 )\n\nexists, then Ri or D(Ri ) are called factors of R or D(R). In this case, we also say that (\u2217) is a recollement of\nR. The ring R is called derived simple if D(R) does not admit any non-trivial recollement whose factors are\nderived categories of rings. It is pointed out in [3] that every Dedekind ring ( thus every discrete valuation\nring) is derived simple.\nA stratification of D(R) is defined to be a sequence of iterated recollements of the following form: a\nrecollement of R, if it is not derived simple,\nx\n\nD(R0 )\nf\n\nx\n/ D(R)\nf\n\n/ D(R1 ) ,\n\nw\n/ D(R0 )\ng\n\n/ D(R01 ) ,\n\na recollement of R0 , if it is not derived simple,\nw\n\nD(R00 )\ng\n\n44\n\n\fand a reollement of R2 , if it is not derived simple,\nw\n\nw\n/ D(R1 )\ng\n\nD(R10 )\ng\n\n/ D(R11 )\n\nand recollements of Ri j with 0 \u2264 i, j \u2264 1, if they are not derived simple, and so on, until one arrives at\nderived simple rings at all positions, or continue to infinitum. All the derived simple rings appearing in this\nprocedure are called composition factors of the stratification. The cardinality of the set of all composition\nfactors (counting the multiplicity) is called the length of the stratification. If this procedure stops after finitely\nmany steps, we say that this stratification is finite or of finite length.\nThe first example shows two stratifications of a derived module category with infinitely many different\nderived simple module categories as composition factors\nExample 7.9. Let Z \u0592\u2192 Q be the inclusion. Then T = Q \u2295 Q/Z is a tilting Z-module, and\n\u0012\n\u0013\nQ HomZ (Q, Q/Z)\nB := EndR (T ) =\n.\nb\n0\nZ\nNote that HomZ (Q, Q/Z) \u2243 R as abelian groups, where R is the field of real numbers.\nWe take \u2206 := mSpec(Z). By Proposition 7.6 and Lemma 7.7(3), we have a recollement:\nv\n\nb\nD(Q \u2297Z Z)\nh\n\nx\n/ D(B)\nf\n\n/ D(Z) .\n\nb Then Z\nb = Ze\nb 2 \u2295 Z(1\nb \u2212 e2 ). This is a decomposition of ideals of Z.\nb Thus we\nLet e2 = (1, 0, * * * , ) \u2208 Z.\nb\nhave a decomposition of ideals of the ring Q \u2297Z Z:\nb = Q \u2297Z Z p \u2295 Q \u2297Z \u220f Z p = Q p \u2295 Q \u2297Z \u220f Z p .\nQ \u2297Z Z\np\u22653\n\np\u22653\n\nb has a derived comThis procedure can be repeated infinitely many times. Then it follows that D(Q \u2297Z Z)\nposition series with infinitely many simple factors D(Q p ). This shows that D(B) has a stratification with\nderived composition factors equivalent to either D(Z) or D(Q p ), both are derived simple, that is, they are\nnot a middle term in any proper recollement of derived module categories of rings.\nTransparently, it follows from the triangular form of B that D(B) has a stratification with infinitely many\ncomposition factors equivalent to either D(Q) or D(Q p ). Clearly, D(Z) and D(Q) are not equivalent as\ntriangulated categories since the global dimension of Z is one and the global dimension of Q is zero. Thus\nD(B) has two stratifications which have different composition factors. This gives negatively an answer to the\nsecond question of the above mentioned problem.\nIn Example 7.9 the two stratifications of the category D(B) by derived module categories have infinite\nmany composition factors. In the next example we shall see that even one requires finiteness of stratifications\nof a derived module category, their composition factors still may be different. This is contrary to the wellknown Jordan-H\u00f6lder theorem which says that any two (finite) composition series of a group have the same\nlist of composition factors (up to the ordering and up to isomorphism).\nExample 7.10. (1) Let I be a non-empty finite subset of mSpec(Z). We consider the exact sequence\n0 \u2192 Z \u2192 Z(I) \u2192\n\nM\np\u2208I\n\n45\n\nE(Z/p) \u2192 0\n\n\fof abelian groups. Then T := Z(I) \u2295\nand 7.4(5), we have\n\nL\n\np\u2208I E(Z/pZ) is\n\nEndZ (T ) \u2243\n\n\u0012\n\na tilting module. On the one hand, by Lemmata 6.4(2)\n\nZ(I) HomZ (ZI , Z(I) /Z)\nL\n0\np\u2208I Z p\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\nOn the other hand, since I is a finite set, by Corollary 7.8, EndZ (T ) admits a recollement\nL\n\nD(\n\nu\n\np\u2208I Q p )\n\ni\n\nv\n/ D(EndZ (T ))\nh\n\n/ D(Z) .\n\nThus, D(EndZ (T )) admits two stratifications, one has the composition factors Z(I) and Z p with p \u2208 I, and\nthe other has the composition factors Z and Q p with p \u2208 I. Since Z(I) is a localization of Z by Lemma 7.7, it\nis of global dimension one. Note that derived equivalences preserve the centers of rings. This shows that all\nrings Z, Z(I) , Z p and Q p are pairwise not derived-equivalent. Hence the two stratifications have completely\ndifferent composition factors.\n(2) Let p = pZ \u2282 Z with p a prime number in N. We consider the exact sequence of Zp -modules:\n0 \u2192 Zp \u2192 Q \u2192 E(Zp /pZp ) \u2192 0.\nDefine T := Q \u2295 E(Zp /pZp ). Thus, by Lemmata 7.4 and 7.8, we have\n\u0012\n\u0013\nQ Qp\nEndZp (T ) \u2243 EndZ (T ) \u2243\n,\n0 Zp\nand a recollement:\nD(Q p )\nh\n\nv\n\nu\n/ D(EndZ (T ))\np\ni\n\n/ D(Zp ) .\n\nNote that the ring EndZp (T ) is left hereditary, but not left noetherian.\nOn the one hand, D(EndZp (T )) has clearly a stratification of length 2 with the composition factors Q\nand Z p . On the other hand, it admits another stratification of length 2 with the composition factors Q p and\nZp . Note that Zp = Q(p) . Since Z p and Q p are uncountable sets and since derived equivalences preserve\nthe centers of rings, we deduce that neither Q and Q(p) , nor Z p and Q(p) are derived equivalent. Clearly,\nthe global dimensions of Z p and Q(p) are one. Thus we have proved that the derived category of the ring\nEndZp (T ) has two stratifications of length two without any common composition factors.\nThus, this example shows also that the main result in [4, Theorem 6.1] for hereditary artin algebras cannot\nbe extended to left hereditary rings.\nNote that in each example given in this section the sets of composition factors of the two stratifications of\nthe derived module category have the same cardinalities. In the next section we shall see that this phenomenon\nis not always true.\n\n8 Further examples and open questions\nThe main purpose of this section is to present examples of derived module categories of rings such that they\npossess two stratifications (by derived module categories of rings) with different finite lengths. Namely, we\nconsider the following\nQuestion. Is there a ring R such that D(R) has two stratifications of different finite lengths by derived\nmodule categories of rings ?\n46\n\n\fThus we solve the whole problem in [4] negatively.\nLet k be a field. We denote by k[x] and k[[x]] the polynomial and formal power series algebras over\nk in one variable x, respectively, and by k((x)) the Laurent power series algebra in one variable x, that is,\nk((x)) := {x\u2212n a | n \u2208 N, a \u2208 k[[x]]}.\n\u0013\n\u0012\nk k2\n. It is known\nNow, let k be an algebraically closed field, and let R be the Kronecker algebra\n0 k\nthat R can be given by the following quiver\nQ: 2\n\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\n// 1 ,\n\nand that R-Mod is equivalent to the category of representations of Q over k.\nLet V be a simple regular R-module. For each m > 0, we denote by V [m] the module of regular length m\non the ray\nV = V [1] \u2282 V [2] \u2282 * * * \u2282 V [m] \u2282 V [m + 1] \u2282 * * * ,\nand let V [\u221e] = lim\n\u2212\u2192 V [m] be the corresponding Pr\u00fc f er modules. Note that the only regular submodule of\nV [\u221e] of regular length m is V [m] with its canonical inclusion in V [\u221e], and that each endomorphism of V [\u221e]\nin R-Mod restricts to an endomorphism of V [m] for any m > 0. Thus, V [\u221e] admits a unique chain of regular\nsubmodules. For more details, we refer to [35, Section 4.5].\n0\n\n// .\nFrom now on, we denote by V the simple regular R-module: k\nk\n1\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 0\n0 0\nLet e1 =\nand e2 =\n. Since HomR (Re1 , Re2 ) \u2243 k2 , we can identify a homomorphism\n0 0\n0 1\nfrom Re1 to Re2 in R-Mod with an element in k2 . Fix a minimal projective resolution of V :\n\u2202:=(1,0)\n\n0 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Re1 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Re2 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 V \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 0,\nand denote by \u03bb : R \u2192 RV the universal localization of R at the set \u03a3 := {\u2202}.\nIt follows from [36, Theorem 4.9, 5.1, and 5.3] that RV is hereditary, \u03bb is injective, and RV \u2295 RV /R\nis a tilting R-module. Moreover, by [6, Proposition 1.8], we get RV /R \u2243 V [\u221e]2 as R-modules. Note that\nHomR (RV /R, RV ) = 0 because RV /R is a torsion module and RV is a torsion-free module.\nFor simplicity of notation, we denote by T the tilting module RV \u2295 V [\u221e]2 . Now, applying Corollary 6.7\nto the module T , we can get the following recollement of derived module categories:\n(\u2217)\n\nv\n\nx\n/ D(B)\nf\n\nD(RV \u2294R S\u2032 )\nh\n\n/ D(R) ,\n\n\u0001\nwhere B := EndR (T ), S\u2032 := M2 EndR (V [\u221e]) and RV \u2294R S\u2032 is the coproduct of RV and S\u2032 over R.\nIn the following, we shall describe the rings B, S\u2032 and RV \u2294R S\u2032 explicitly.\nFirst, by Lemma 3.1,\n\u0012 we can check\n\u0013 that\n\u0012 RV = M2 (k[x]),\n\u0013 the 2 \u00d7 2 matrix algebra over k[x], and the map\na (c, d)\na c + dx\n\u03bb : R \u2192 RV is given by\n7\u2192\nfor any a, b, c, d \u2208 k. This means RV e1 \u2243 RV e2 as\n0\nb\n0\nb\nRV -modules, and therefore we have the following ring isomorphisms:\n\u0012\n\u0013!\n\u0010\n\u0011\ne1 RV e1 HomR (RV e1 ,V [\u221e])\n.\n(\u2217\u2217) B \u2243 M2 EndR (RV e1 \u2295V [\u221e]) \u2243 M2\n0\nEndR (V [\u221e])\nSecond, we claim that EndR (V [\u221e]) is isomorphic to k[[x]]. In fact, this follows from the following isomorphisms of abelian groups:\nm\nEndR (V [\u221e]) \u2243 lim\n\u2190\u2212 HomR (V [m],V [\u221e]) \u2243 lim\n\u2190\u2212 HomR (V [m],V [m]) \u2243 lim\n\u2190\u2212 k[x]/(x ) \u2243 k[[x]],\n\n47\n\n\fwhere the composition of the above isomorphisms gives rise to a ring isomorphism \u03c9 : EndR (V [\u221e]) \u2192 k[[x]].\nThus S\u2032 \u2243 M2 (k[[x]]) as rings. In this sense, we can identify S\u2032 with M2 (k[[x]]) under the isomorphism \u03c9.\n\u2032\nThird, a direct calculation\nthat\u0013the ring\n\u0012 \u2032shows\n\u0012 homomorphism\n\u0013 \u03bc : R \u2192 S , which appears in the proof of\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\na (c , d )\na d +c x\nCorollary 6.7, is given by\n7\u2192\nfor any a\u2032 , b\u2032 , c\u2032 , d \u2032 \u2208 k.\n0\nb\u2032\n0\nb\u2032\n\u0001\nFinally, we claim RV \u2294R S\u2032 \u2243 M2 k((x)) as rings.\nRecall that RV is the universal localization of R at \u03a3 := {\u2202}. Define \u03c6 := S\u2032 \u2297R \u2202 : S\u2032 e1 \u2192 S\u2032 e2 . Then\nit follows from Lemma 6.2 that RV \u2294R S\u2032 is isomorphic to the universal localization S\u03c6\u2032 of S\u2032 at \u03c6. Since\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 x\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nHomS\u2032 (S e1 , S e2 ) \u2243 e1 S e2 \u2243 k[[x]], the map \u03c6 corresponds to the matrix element\nin S\u2032 . Now, let\n0 0\n\u03c1x : k[[x]] \u2192 k[[x]] be the right multiplication\nmap by x. Since S\u2032 is Morita equivalent to k[[x]], we conclude\n\u0001\nfrom Lemma 3.4 that S\u03c6\u2032 = M2 k[[x]]\u03c1x , where k[[x]]\u03c1x is the universal localization of k[[x]] at \u03c1x . Since\nk[[x]] is commutative, the ring k[[x]]\u03c1x is isomorphic to the localization \u0398\u22121 k[[x]] of k[[x]] at the multiplication\nsubset \u0398 := {xm | m \u2208 N}. Thus \u0398\u22121 k[[x]] is the Laurent power series ring k((x)). Therefore, we get the\nfollowing isomorphisms of rings:\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nRV \u2294R S\u2032 \u2243 S\u03c6\u2032 \u2243 M2 k[[x]]\u03c1x \u2243 M2 \u0398\u22121 k[[x]] \u2243 M2 k((x)) .\n\nOn the one hand, by setting C := EndR (RV e1 \u2295V [\u221e]) and using Morita equivalences, the recollement (\u2217)\ncan be rewritten as\nv\u0001\nD k((x))\nh\n\nx\n/ D(C)\nf\n\n/ D(R) .\n\nOn the other hand, since e1 RV e1 \u2243 k[x] and EndR (V [\u221e]) \u2243 k[[x]], it follows from (\u2217\u2217) that the ring C\nadmits another recollement\nw\n\u0001w\n/ D(k[[x]]) .\n/ D(C)\nD k[x]\ng\n\ng\n\nSince derived equivalences preserve the centers of rings, all rings k, k[x], k[[x]] and k((x)) are pairwise not\nderived equivalent. Moreover, they are derived simple. Clearly, D(R) has a stratification of length 2 with\ncomposition factors D(k) and D(k). Thus C admits two stratifications, one of which is of length 3 with three\ncomposition factors k((x)), k and k, and the other is of length 2 with composition factors k[x] and k[[x]]. As\na result, we have shown that the two stratifications of D(C) by derived categories of rings are of different\nlengths and without any common composition factors.\nRemarks. (1) For any simple regular R-module V \u2032 , we can choose an automorphism \u03c3 : R \u2192 R, such that\nthe induced functor \u03c3\u2217 : R-Mod \u2192 R-Mod by \u03c3 is an equivalence and satisfies \u03c3\u2217 (V \u2032 ) \u2243 V . Hence, instead\nof V , we may use V \u2032 to proceed the above procedure, but we will get the same recollements, up to derived\nequivalence of each term.\n(2) Let K0 (R) be the Grothendieck group of R, that is, the abelian group generated by isomorphism\nclasses [P] of finitely generated projective R-modules P subject to the relation [P]\u0001+ [Q] = [P \u2295 Q], where P\nand Q are finitely generated projective R-modules. One can check that K0 k((x)) \u2243 Z and K0 (C) \u2243 Z \u2295 Z.\nThe above example shows that, even if D(A2 ) is a recollement of D(A1 ) and D(A3 ), where Ai are rings for\ni = 1, 2, 3, we cannot get K0 (A2 ) \u2243 K0 (A1 ) \u2295 K0 (A3 ) in general.\n\nFor a general consideration of stratifications of the endomorphism algebras of tilting modules over tame\nhereditary algebras, we shall discuss it in a forthcoming paper.\nFinally, we remark that Theorem 1.1(2) can be extended to n-tilting modules. However, since there is not\ndefined any reasonable torsion theory in module categories for general n-tilting modules, we are not able to\nextend Theorem 1.1(1) to n-tilting modules. So we mention the following open question.\n48\n\n\fQuestion 1. Is Theorem 1.1(1) true for n-good tilting modules ?\nAnother question related to our examples is:\nQuestion 2. Is there a ring R such that D(R) has two stratifications by derived module categories of\nrings, one of which is of finite length, and the other is of infinite length ?\n\nReferences\n[1] L.
