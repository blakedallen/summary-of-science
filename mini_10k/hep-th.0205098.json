The action is known for linear profiles of the\ntachyon, which is the expected asymptotic behavior of the tachyon as it approaches the\nclosed string vacuum, as recently described by Sen.

For instance, the BSFT action implies there are\npoles for certain rolling velocities, while a Born-Infeld action would have a cut. We also\nfind that solutions with pressure diminishing from either the positive or negative side are\npossible.\n\n1\n\nE-mail: joseph.minahan@teorfys.uu.se\n\n1\n\n\fThere has been much recent interest in time dependent solutions of string theory.\nAmong other things, these solutions could have interesting cosmological implications. Not\nsurprisingly, time dependent solutions in the closed string sector are much more difficult\nto handle, because of the presence of gravity. However, one expects that time dependent\nsolutions involving the open string sector can be more easily controlled, since at tree level,\ngravity is turned off.\nThe first such open string solutions were the spatial branes in [1]. Here, the tachyon\nhas a time dependent profile with the tachyon rolling up and down the potential. It was\nassumed that the tachyon is damped as it rolls down the hill, with the energy radiating\ninto closed string modes, so that the tachyon stops at the bottom of the potential.\nThis then raises a puzzle about what happens at tree-level, where radiation into closed\nstring modes does not occur. Energy should be conserved, but there are no open string\nmodes where the energy can be radiated into. On the other, hand, if the energy is not\nbeing lost, it would seem that the tachyon configuration would be oscillating back and\nforth through the closed string vacuum. But there is a strong feeling that there is only\none direction in field space out of the closed string vacuum, so it seems impossible to set\nup such a ringing configuration.\nThese puzzles were recently answered by Sen [2, 3, 4], who argued that while the\ntachyon rolls down the potential, conserving energy, it never reaches the closed string\nvacuum. Hence, there is no need for the tachyon to roll up on the other side of the closed\nstring vacuum.\nSen described an effective field theory that exhibits this behavior. Consider the BornInfeld type action [5, 6, 7]\nS=\u2212\n\nZ\n\nq\n\ndD x 1 \u2212 \u03b1\u2032\u2202\u03bc T \u2202 \u03bd T V (T ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere V (T ) is the tachyon potential that approaches 0 as T \u2192 \u221e. If we consider spatially\nhomogenous solutions to the equation of motion, we find the conserved energy density is\ngiven by\nV (T )\n.\n(2)\nE=q\n1 \u2212 \u1e6a 2\n\nHence, energy conservation requires that \u1e6a \u2192 1 as T \u2192 \u221e, hence the field configuration\napproaches a constant \"velocity\". On the other hand, the pressure is given by\nq\n\nP = \u2212V (T ) 1 \u2212 \u1e6a 2 ,\n2\n\n(3)\n\n\fand so goes to zero as T \u2192 \u221e. Thus, as the brane decays, we are left with a pressure tachyon matter whose energy density depends on initial conditions. Cosmological\nconsiderations for this and other tachyon actions have been considered in [8]\u2013[19].\nSuppose that we consider specific tachyon profiles in the action in (1), which do not\nnecessarily correspond to solutions to the equations of motion. For instance, suppose that\nwe consider a tachyon profile with\nT = ut.\n(4)\nAssuming that the potential is well enough behaved, the action becomes\n\u221a\n\u221a\nZ\n1 \u2212 u2\n1 \u2212 u2\nS(u) = \u2212\nV0 dT V (T ) = \u2212\nV0 K\nu\nu\n\n(5)\n\nwhere V0 is a volume factor and K is independent of u. Hence, if the effective field theory\nis of Born-Infeld type, we expect to find a branch cut in S(u) at u2 = 1.\nIn boundary string field theory (BSFT), the effective actions for tachyon fields were\ncomputed for simple profiles [20, 21]. In the bosonic theory, the profiles had the form\n[22, 20, 21]\nT = a + ui x2i ,\n(6)\nwhere the xi are spatial coordinates. In particular, it was shown that the condensation\nof a D25 brane to a D(25-p) corresponds to ui = 0, i = 1, .., 25 \u2212 p and ui \u2192 \u221e for\ni = 26\u2212p, ..25. Unfortunately for our purposes here, the tachyon field has to be quadratic,\nor independent of the Xi since the tachyon potential is unbounded below as T \u2192 \u2212\u221e.\nHence, the integral in (5) would not be convergent.\nInstead, let us consider the BSFT for the type IIA D9 brane. This was considered in\n[23], where the field theory action was conjectured to be\nS = Z,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere Z is the partition function for a boundary perturbation of a free conformal field\ntheory. This conjecture was later verified in [24, 25] using a BV formulation. Let the\ntachyon profile have the form\nT =ux\n(8)\nwhere x is one spatial direction. Let us define y = \u03b1\u2032 u2 /2. In [23], it was shown that\nassuming (7), the Euclidean action for such a profile is given by\n\u221a\n\u221a\ny \u0393(y)2\ny\n\u2032\nS(y) = Z(y) = T9 V0 \u03b1 4\n,\n(9)\n2 \u0393(2y)\n3\n\n\fwhere T9 is the tension of the unstable brane and V0 is the 9 dimensional volume factor.\nThis action should be thought of as an action with the fields restricted as follows:\nS(y) = T9\n\nZ\n\n= T9\n\ns\n\nd10 x L(T, T \u2032 , T \u2032\u2032, ...)\n\u03b1\u2032\n2y\n\nZ\n\nd9 x dT L(T,\n\ns\n\nT \u2032 =u,T \u2032\u2032 =0..\n\n2y\n, 0, ...)\n\u03b1\u2032\n\n(10)\n\nThe authors in [23] then argued that the stable D8 brane is the profile with y \u2192 \u221e and\nthey obtained the correct ratio of tensions between the unstable D9 brane and the stable\nD8 brane.\nOf course, what we really want is the Lagrangian and not just the action. It is known\nthat for \u1e6a = 0, the Lagrangian is [23, 26]\n1\n\n2\n\n\u2212 T9 e\u2212 4 T .\n\n(11)\n\nWe will now make the further assumption that the Lagrangian, up to first derivatives, is\ngiven by\nZ\n1 2\n(12)\n\u2212 T9 dtd9 x f (\u03b1\u2032 \u2202\u03bc T \u2202 \u03bc T /2)e\u2212 4 T .\nComparing this expression with (9), we see that\ny \u0393(y)2\nf (y) = 4y\u22121/2 \u221a\n.\n2\u03c0 \u0393(2y)\n\n(13)\n\nNote that for large y,\n\n1q \u2032\n\u03b1 \u2202\u03bc T \u2202 \u03bc T ,\n(14)\n2\nwhich does have Born-Infeld like behavior [27].\nLet us now Wick rotate the spatial direction into a time direction. Under the Wick\nrotation, x \u2192 i t and u \u2192 \u2212i u, so that the profile is\nf (y) \u2248\n\nT = u t.\n\n(15)\n\nBut we also see that y \u2192 \u2212y and the action rotates to S \u2192 \u2212iS, with the Minkowskian\naction given by\n\u221a\n\u221a\ny \u0393(\u2212y)2\n\u2212y\n\u2032\n\u221a\nS = T9 V0 \u03b1 4\n.\n(16)\n2 \u0393(\u22122y)\nHence, the action has poles for y any nonnegative integer.\n4\n\n\fThe pole at y = 0 is already in the Euclidean action and corresponds to the infinite\nvolume factor between the D9 brane and the D8 brane. Let us then consider the other\npoles. If we write y = n \u2212 \u01eb, then the action is approximately\n\u221a\n\u221a\nn \u0393(2n + 1) 1\n\u2212n\u22121/2\n\u2032\n.\n(17)\nS(y) \u2248 T9 V0 \u03b1 4\n\u0393(n + 1)2\n\u01eb\nHence, we may infer that for profiles near these poles, the action is approximately\nS \u2248 T9\n\nZ\n\ndtd9 x\n\nwhere Vn (T ) is\nVn (T ) = 4\n\n\u2212n\u22121/2\n\n\u221a\n\nVn (T )\n,\n2n \u2212 \u03b1\u2032 \u2202\u03bc T \u2202 \u03bc T\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03b1\u2032 \u0393(2n + 1)\n2\ne\u2212T /4 .\n2\u03c0 \u0393(n)\u0393(n + 1)\n\n(18)\n\n(19)\n\nFor \u03b1\u2032 \u1e6a 2 close to 2n, the action will be dominated by the term in (18). For such a\nterm, the energy density for a rolling tachyon is given by\nE \u2248 T9\n\n3\u03b1\u2032 \u1e6a 2 \u2212 2n\nVn (T ),\n(2n \u2212 \u03b1\u2032 \u1e6a 2 )2\n\n(20)\n\nP \u2248 T9\n\n1\nVn (T ).\n(2n \u2212 \u03b1\u2032 \u1e6a 2 )\n\n(21)\n\nand the pressure is\n\nLet us now consider the consequences of (20) and (21). First we see that the BSFT\naction is consistent with the general Sen picture that the rolling tachyon asympotically\nreaches a constant velocity with conserved energy. Since Vn (T ) falls off rapidly to zero as\nT \u2192 \u221e, \u03b1\u2032 \u1e6a 2 must rapidly approach 2n, for some positive integer n. Second, in order\nfor the energy density to remain constant, the pressure must go to zero as T \u2192 \u221e.\nHowever, there are some interesting differences as compared to the Born-Infeld action.\nFirst, there is no longer a maximum rolling velocity, it is now possible to have \u03b1\u2032 \u1e6a 2 > 2.\nHowever, it takes an infinite amount of energy to cross from \u03b1\u2032 \u1e6a 2 < 2n to \u03b1\u2032 \u1e6a 2 > 2n.\nSo if the initial conditions have 2n < \u03b1\u2032 \u1e6a 2 < 2(n + 1), the tachyon rolling velocity will\nstay within that window.\nThe second difference between this behavior and the Born-Infeld model is that while\nthe pressure approaches 0 in both cases, in the Born-Infeld case, it is always negative.\nHowever, the pressure in (21) can be either negative or positive. So for example, if the\ninitial conditions start with \u1e6a = 0, the pressure starts out negative, equalling the negative\n5\n\n\fof the energy density, but then crosses through zero pressure, before relaxing back down\nto zero.\nHowever, it is also possible to approach zero pressure from the negative direction. For\ninstance, if \u03b1\u2032 \u1e6a 2 is slightly greater than 2n, then the rolling velocity will relax down to\n\u03b1\u2032 \u1e6a 2 = 2n. Since \u03b1\u2032 \u1e6a 2 > 2n, the pressure is negative. However, if \u03b1\u2032 \u1e6a 2 is too big, the\nvelocity will increase toward \u03b1\u2032 \u1e6a 2 = 2(n + 1), and the pressure will be positive.\nNote that positive pressures should be possible. Indeed, in Sen's analysis the static\nvacuum can be perturbed by the marginal operator\n\u221a\n\u03bb sinh(2t/ \u03b1\u2032 ),\n\n(22)\n\nin which case, the pressure is proportional to\nP \u223c1\u2212\n\n1\n\n1+\n\n\u221a\ne2t/ \u03b1\u2032\n\n2\n\nsinh (\u03bb\u03c0)\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n\n1+\n\n\u221a\ne\u22122t/ \u03b1\u2032\n\nsinh2 (\u03bb\u03c0)\n\n.\n\n(23)\n\nThis perturbation corresponds to having an initial rolling velocity at the height of the\npotential at t = 0. If sinh(\u03bb\u03c0) > 1, then the pressure is positive.\nOf course, there are many assumptions that go into this analysis. The first is that the\nstring field action does have the form in (7). The second assumption is that the poles\nthat appear in the action in (10) are actually due to poles in the integrand, that is the\nLagrangian, as opposed to poles that arise after integrating over T . For example, the\naction would have a pole if the Lagrangian had a term of the form\nexp(\u2212T 2 (2n \u2212 \u03b1\u2032 \u1e6a 2 )2 /16n2 ).\n\n(24)\n\nFor such a term, the constant energy solutions would still have \u1e6a relaxing to a constant.\nHowever, the asymptotic pressure would not be zero.\nFinally, terms with higher derivatives of T do not contribute to the action if T has a\nlinear profile. The appearance of such terms in the full lagrangian could effect the physics.\nNote added: After this paper was completed we received [28], which has significant\noverlap with this work.\nAcknowledgments: I would like to thank the CTP at MIT for hospitality during the\ncourse of this work.
