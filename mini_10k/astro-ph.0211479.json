Galaxies: active \u2013 quasars: individual: PG 0844+349 \u2013 X\u2013rays: galaxies\n\n1. Introduction\nQuasars as a class of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) exhibit\na vast diversity in their observed properties. Some of these,\nlike the radio-loud - radio-quiet dichotomy, can be related to\nthe physical characteristics of the accreting central black hole\nand to morphological differences of the host galaxies. Others\ncan result from specific geometrical conditions of the accretion\nflow and from the particular viewing condition of the observer\nwith respect to the quasar (see, for example, Elvis 2000). In\nmany cases, however, the causes for the unusual properties of\na quasar remain obscure and thus the study of objects displaying atypical characteristics might yield important clues to the\nphysical processes governing the quasar emission.\nOne of the objects with several extraordinary properties\nis PG 0844+349, a well studied nearby (z=0.064), bright\n(mv =14.0), radio-quiet quasar from the Palomar Green sample\n(Schmidt & Green 1983). Deep radio observations reveal no\nnuclear source and the faint detection in the field (S1.49 GHz =\n0.3 mJy) might be related to an R = 20 mag object south-west\nof the quasar (Condon et al. 1987). PG 0844+349 is optically\nquite spectacular: it appears as a barred spiral with complex\nouter structure and a nearly equally bright companion galaxy\n(Hutchings & Crampton 1990). It belongs to the class of AGN\nwith unusually strong Fe II emission (Wang et al. 1996) and according to the optical spectrum displayed in Boroson & Green\n(1992) the source shows all features of a Narrow-Line Seyfert\nSend offprint requests to: W. Brinkmann; e-mail: wpb@rzg.mpg.de\n\n1 galaxy (NLSy1) - strong FeII emission and weak forbidden narrow lines, although its FWHM(H\u03b2) = 2420 km s\u22121 is\nslightly above the often used cut-off line of 2000 km s\u22121 (e.g.\nOsterbrock & Pogge, 1985). However, this cut-off for the classification of NLSy1s is more artificial than physical, so we still\nmight define this source as a NLSy1 galaxy especially as it\nshows X-ray properties typical for this class of objects, i.e., a\nsteep soft X-ray spectrum and strong variability (for reviews\nsee Boller et al. 2000). It is infrared-loud with a disturbed host\ngalaxy (Clements 2000), and it is strongly variable at all wavelengths on various time scales. The optical flux seems to have\nchanged by \u223c70% between 1986 (Elvis et al. 1994) and 1993\n(Maoz et al. 1994) and intra-night variations with amplitudes of\n\u2206B = 0.08 mag were detected by Jang et al. (1997). From reverberation measurements Kaspi et al. (2000) deduced a mass\nof \u223c 2.5 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 for the quasar.\nCompared to the ROSAT All Sky Survey (Yuan et al. 1998)\nthe soft X-ray flux of PG 0844+349 had decreased by a factor\nof \u223c6 in a pointed ROSAT observation 6 months later, without any noticeable changes in the spectral slope (Rachen et al.\n1996). During the X-ray low state PG 0844+349 had an Xray loudness of \u03b1ox > 2, i.e. it could be regarded as 'X-ray\nweak' compared to the average < \u03b1ox >\u223c 1.6 for radio-quiet\nquasars (Yuan et al. 1998). In an ASCA observation the object\nwas found in a high state, with a photon index of \u0393 = 1.98 and\na Fe K\u03b1 line with EW \u223c 300 eV. On shorter time scales, the\nX-ray flux in the 2\u201310 keV band is highly variable; the fastest\nvariation detected is 60% in less than 2 \u00d7 104 s (Wang et al.\n\n\f2\n\nW. Brinkmann et al.: XMM-Newton observations of PG 0844 + 349\n\n2000). Historic light curves in the X-ray, UV, and optical bands\nindicate that the variability amplitude in the UV and optical\n(up to 70%) is much smaller than in X-rays (up to a factor\nof 10). The optical micro-variability of this object can actually be driven by re-processing of the variable X-ray flux if\nonly half of the absorbed X-rays are re-radiated in the opticalto-UV band. The comparison with Einstein (Kriss 1988) and\nEXOSAT (Malaguti et al. 1994) observations further showed\nthat the quasar can be classified as X-ray weak only in one out\nof five X-ray observations (for details see Wang et al. 2000).\nTo what extent the intensity variations are related to spectral\nchanges is difficult to examine in detail due to the poor statistics\nof the pointed ROSAT/ASCA spectra, especially if significant\nX-ray scattering is present. Corbin & Boroson (1996) mention\nthat the quasar shows 'associated absorption' in an HST spectrum and Wang et al. (2000) claim the existence of narrow associated Ly\u03b1 absorption. There are no HST data for the C IV\nregion, but co-added IUE data suggest C IV absorption consistent in velocity with the Ly\u03b1 absorption.\n\n2. The XMM-Newton observation\nPG 0844+349 was observed by XMM-Newton on November\n5, 2000. The EPIC PN was operated in Full Window mode with\nmedium filter with a total exposure of \u223c 21 ksec. Both MOS\ncameras were in Large Window mode with medium filters as\nwell, each yielding \u223c 23.5 ksec of data. The two RGS chains\nwere operated in Spectroscopy mode, both with exposures of\n\u223c 26 ksec. The OM camera was operated in Imaging mode\nand five images were taken with the U-band filter (300\u2013400\nnm). For the data analysis we used the XMMSAS version 5.2.0\nfor EPIC and OM, and version 5.3.0 for RGS.\n\n2.1. The light curve\nWe determined the 0.5\u221210 keV PN light curve of\nPG 0844+349 by accumulating the photons in 400 sec bins\nfrom a circular region of radius r = 100\u2032\u2032 around the quasar position; for this we selected single and double events with quality flag = 0 (for details of the EPIC detectors see Ehle et al.\n2001). For the MOS data we took singles and doubles (Pattern\n0\u221212) as well and selected the photons from a circular region\nof radius r = 60\u2032\u2032 around the source.\nDuring the observation the background was rather noisy\nwith some strong flares. The total background count rate generally contributes only about 4% of the source count rate.\nHowever, in two flares the background count rate at energies\nabove 3 keV reaches up to 40% of the source count rate and\ncare has to be taken in the spectral analysis. In particular, we\nignore data from the last 2 ksec of the observation as the background count rate becomes very variable then. Since there are\nno differences between PN and MOS light curves, in order to\nincrease the signal-to-noise ratio, we summed up the PN count\nrates (average 6.61 cts/s) and the two MOS count rates (average MOS 1: 1.93 cts/s; MOS 2: 1.94 cts/s). The summed,\nbackground subtracted, EPIC light curve shown in Fig. 1 starts\nat the switch on of the PN camera. There are about 2.5 ksec of\nMOS data previous to that, where the source stays on the same\n\nFig. 1. Background subtracted summed PN + MOS light curve\nof PG 0844+349; the time binning is 400 sec.\n\nhigh, flat count rate level. The RGS observation started around\nthe same time as the PN, and lasted some 1.8 ksec longer, well\ninto the period of flaring background.\nThe EPIC count rate (see Fig. 1) starts to decrease after\nabout 4 ksec, recovers for \u223c 2 ksec and then changes by about\n25% to a lower intensity level near the middle of the observation. The flux drops occur in a smooth, nearly linear fashion at a rate of \u223c 6.1 \u00d7 10\u22124 cts s\u22122 . We will show in the\nnext section that these changes are achromatic to high statistical significance. With the spectral information obtained below,\nthe K-corrected 0.5\u201310 keV luminosity during the first part of\nthe observation is \u223c 2.5 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 . We can use the \u223c\n20% decline of the count rate over \u223c 3500 s near the middle\nof the observation to estimate the lower limit of the radiative\nefficiency, \u03b7 > 5 \u00d7 10\u221243 \u2206L/\u2206t (Fabian 1984), and we obtain \u03b7 > 7 \u00d7 10\u22123 which is far below the theoretical limit for a\nSchwarzschild black hole.\nThe OM provided U-filter images integrated for \u223c 4000 s\neach. The brightness of the source, obtained from the Pipeline\nProcessing System (PPS), stayed approximately constant at\n14.00 mag; the largest deviation from this average value occured during the period \u223c 2\u20136 ksec after the start of the PN exposure, during the first intensity dip, when the source was 0.01\nmag fainter than the average. This is, however, only a \u223c 1.5\u03c3\neffect which implies that any variations of the optical flux are\nnegligible compared to the changes in the X-ray band.\n\n2.2. Spectral properties\nFor the EPIC spectral analysis we used the latest available response matrices (version 6.1) issued in December 2001. For the\nPN camera we extracted single and double events with quality\nflag = 0 from a circular region with a radius of 45\u2032\u2032 around the\nsource position. This radius includes \u223c 88% of the source photons (Ghizzardi & Molendi 2001) but avoids the gap between\nthe detector chips. The background was taken on the same chip\n> 7 cts s\u22121 in\nat a similar offset position. With a count rate of \u223c\nthe high state the PN detector, operated in Full Window mode,\n\n\fW.

Broken power law fit to the total PN + combined MOS\ndata of PG 0844+349; the PN spectrum is the upper curve.\n\nshowed strong indications of pile-up, clearly apparent from the\nXMMSAS task epatplot. We therefore discarded photons from\nthe innermost 3 \u00d7 3 RAW pixels at the core of the point spread\nfunction from the spectral analysis. As a consequence, the normalizations of the models in the PN fits given in Table 1 are\nunderestimating the actual photon flux. Further, we discarded\nthe data of the last \u223c 2 ksec of the observation, when the background was strongly flaring, and we excluded times of high\nbackground, i.e. greater than 50 cts/s, from the Good Time\nIntervals (GTI) file. However, this last selection criterion influenced the quality of the fits only marginally. For the two MOS\ncameras we selected events with pattern \u2264 12 and flag = 0 and\na similar extraction radius as for the PN; the background was\ntaken from an area on the same chips near the source. Pile-up\ndid not influence the spectral fits of the MOS data noticeably;\ntherefore the full data were used.\nThe RGS spectra of PG 0844+349 were accumulated by\nselecting counts from a region centered on the source position\nand enclosing 90% of the point spread function in the cross\ndispersion direction, and making the first order selection by\nincluding 90% of the expected CCD pulse height distribution\nof the source photons. The background spectrum was obtained\nfrom two spatial regions excluding 95% of the source point\nspread function in the cross dispersion direction and performing the same order selection as for the source.\nWhile the ASCA high state data could be well fitted by\na simple absorbed power law (Wang et al. 2000), this model\ndoes not provide an acceptable fit to the PN data from the first,\nhigh state part of the observation. With a reduced \u03c72 = 1.42\nthe fitted power law index is \u0393 = 2.57 and the residuals\nclearly show that at higher energies the spectrum gets flatter.\nA broken power law, fixing the absorption at the Galactic value\nNH = 3.32 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 (Lockman & Savage 1995), gives an\nacceptable fit to the PN data with a reduced \u03c72 = 1.03 for\n372 d.o.f. (see Table 1). Fitting the same time interval with the\nMOS1 and the MOS 2 data separately yielded similar acceptable fits. The fit parameters in Table 1 indicate that the two\nMOS spectra have nearly identical power law slopes. In both\nMOS cameras the residuals at the lowest energies show an S-\n\n3\n\nshaped pattern with a maximum at \u223c 0.5 keV, while the PN fits,\nwith generally slightly flatter power laws and a higher break\nenergy, show systematic positive residuals at \u223c 0.6 keV.\nApplying the same model to the low state, i.e. the period between 10 and 19 ksec after the start of the observation, gave an\nacceptable fit with nearly identical parameters, with the same\n'typical' differences between the three detectors as above (see\nTable 1).\nWe repeated the fit over several other, shorter time intervals\nduring the observation and always obtained acceptable fits with\nvery similar parameters. We thus conclude that no statistically\nsignificant spectral variations occur during the flux changes of\nthe source. Therefore for the subsequent fits we used the data\nfrom the full observation, again excluding the last 2 ksec and\ntimes of high background.\nFig.2 shows the simultaneous broken power law fit to the\nwhole data set for the PN and the combined MOS instruments.\nDue to the slight differences between the PN and MOS cameras, visible at \u223c 0.5\u20130.6 keV and at higher energies, the quality of the fit is only moderate (\u03c72red = 1.11 for 1006 d.o.f.).\nAdding a Gaussian iron line does not improve the fit, mainly\nbecause of the low statistical significance of the data at higher\nenergies. We therefore fitted the PN data separately for the 2\u20139\nkeV range with a single power law and, secondly, with a power\nlaw plus a Gaussian line. We find a broad line at an energy\nof 6.25\u00b10.13 keV (El,rest = 6.65 \u00b1 0.13 keV in the quasar's\nrest frame) and an equivalent width of \u223c 235 eV. For a narrow\nline (i.e. fixing the Gaussian sigma at 10 eV) we get the same\nline energy and an equivalent width of \u223c 120 eV. Including the\nlines improves the quality of the fits marginally (see Table 1),\nbut only at a \u223c 94% confidence level, according to an F-test.\nThe small equivalent width found is atypical for NLSy1 galaxies, for which BeppoSax (Comastri 2000) and ASCA (Turner\net al. 1998) generally find ionized iron lines with large equivalent widths (few 100 eV).\nThe moderate quality of the combined PN and MOS fits\nand the fit residuals can be explained as resulting from the\nremaining uncertainties in the detector calibrations. However,\nthey might also indicate that the chosen spectral model can be\nimproved.\nIn Fig. 3 we show the power law fit to the total PN data\nfor the 2\u221210 keV range, extrapolated to lower energies. The\nslope of \u0393 \u223c 2.04, consistent with ASCA, is probably not affected by contributions of more complex models for the low\nenergy part of the spectrum. The ratio between the data and\nthe model clearly shows the 'gradual soft excess' (Pounds &\nReeves 2002) also found in other AGN with the high sensitivity and large bandwidth of XMM-Newton. While the hard\npower law tail seems to be well constrained, the exact shape\nof the spectrum at low energies remains uncertain. We therefore tried several composite models, mainly to characterize the\nsofter part of the spectrum.\nModels including a thermal component in addition to the\nhard power law fit the data quite well, as shown in Table 1;\nthe relative contribution of the power law component can be\ninferred from the listed normalization. The power law + bbody\nfit provides two solutions: one in which the power law component represents the hard flux, the black body temperature is\n\n\f4\n\nW.

Power law fit to the total PN data in the energy range\n2\u221210 keV; the fitted model is extrapolated to lower energies.\nThe lower panel gives the ratio between data and model.\nsimilar to that of the diskbbody and another, perhaps less physical solution, where the steep power law provides the soft flux,\nthe hot bbody the hard flux (these parameters are given in Table\n1). All models are statistically acceptable (although the above\nmentioned systematic residuals at \u223c 0.6 keV persist in all fits)\nand therefore the physical nature of the soft emission remains\nunclear.\nAs the fitted slope of the spectrum at higher energies seems\nto harden with energy we tried to fit a curved continuum model\n(Fossati et al. 2000) but no good fit could be achieved. We further tried several composite cases fixing the hard power law\nindex at the best fit slope of the 2\u221210 keV fit but we never\nobtained an acceptable fit: this seems to indicate that the hard\npower law is only the tail of a distribution and not a separate\ncomponent.\n\nFig. 4. Power law + bremsstrahlung fit to the PN, RGS1 and\nRGS2 data of PG 0844+349.\nNearly featureless spectra with a strong soft component are\nindicative of Comptonization of soft photons in the hot corona\nof an accretion disk (Haardt & Maraschi 1993). A fit with the\nXspec Comptonization model comptt (Titarchuk 1994) failed\nto reproduce the hard power law and resulted in an unacceptable fit (\u03c72red = 1.97). Adding a hard power law to the comptt\nmodel (\u03c72red = 1.09/1094 d.o.f) or fitting the sum of two\nComptonization models with different temperatures and optical depths of the scattering medium (\u03c72red = 1.11/1093 d.o.f)\nresulted in fits nearly as good as the models in Table 1. For the\ndouble - comptt fit we either assumed the same temperature for\nthe two soft photon components or left them free to vary independently. In all three cases the bulk of the flux up to \u223c 3 keV\noriginates from Comptonization of soft photons off a gas of kT\n\u223c 4.5 keV and optical depth \u03c4 \u223c 2.4. The high energy part of\nthe spectrum is formed either by the power law component or\n\n\fW. Brinkmann et al.: XMM-Newton observations of PG 0844 + 349\n\nthe second Comptonization component with kT\u223c 16 keV and\n\u03c4 \u223c 3.3. The temperatures of the soft photons were fitted to\nbe kT0 = 65+99\n\u221265 eV in case of the extra power law component, kT0 = 3+71\n\u22123 eV (using the same values for the two soft\n+341\ncomponents) and kT0 (1) = 12+169\n\u221212 eV and kT0 (2) = 2\u22122\neV for the case of two independent soft components, respectively. The temperatures of the Comptonizing electrons are at\nthe low end of the expected temperature range for AGN (Haardt\n& Maraschi 1993) while the fitted optical depths are higher\nthan usually deduced. The temperatures of the soft photons appear rather low; however, the parameters are very poorly constrained because of the close coupling of temperature and optical depth in the Comptonization models. Interestingly, the high\noptical depth implies that any reflection features (like the iron\nline) are suppressed by Compton scattering in the corona itself\n(Matt et al. 1997).\nThe superior energy resolution of the RGS data could provide an ultimate test for the nature of the soft emission. The\nsame composite models tried on the PN data alone (see Table\n1) were fitted simultaneously to the RGS1 and RGS2 spectra, as well as to the PN. The hard power law slope and the\ntemperature of the soft component were kept fix at the best fit\nvalue obtained from the fits of the PN alone, and the normalizations for the three instruments were allowed to vary independently of each other (because of the PN data selection used\nto avoid pile-up). The low energy absorption column was fixed\nat the Galactic value. Values of \u03c72red /dof very similar to those\nin Table 1 for the PN alone were obtained (in the range 0.98\u2013\n1.05/841), with the formally best fit model being the combination of a power law and a bremsstrahlung component. This best\nfit and the data are shown in Fig.4; the fit of the pow/diskbb and\npow/mekal are virtually indistinguishable from this. Although\nthe signal-to-noise ratio of the RGS data is only moderate, it is\nclear that there is no evidence of emission or absorption structures in the spectrum, indicating the absence of any additional\nsource intrinsic absorbers. In particular, there is no evidence of\nexcess emission in the RGS at \u223c0.6 keV which could explain\nthe amplitude and the shape of the residuals observed in the PN\nfit.\nIn the following, we use the broken power law model for\nthe determination of the source's energetics; however, it should\nbe kept in mind that this is a rather artificial representation of\nthe source's spectrum and that at the lowest energies the flux\ndistribution might be quite different from a simple power law,\nintroducing some uncertainty in the numerical values.\nThe observed average un-absorbed flux in the high state in\nthe 0.2\u201310.0 keV range amounts to 2.6\u00d710\u221211erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ,\nwhile the average in the low state is 2.1\u00d710\u221211erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 .\nWith these fluxes the K-corrected X-ray luminosity of\nPG 0844+349 is in the range L0.2\u221210 keV = (4.1 \u2212 4.9) \u00d7 1044\nerg s\u22121 , using a Friedman cosmology with H0 = 50 km s\u22121\nMpc\u22121 and q0 = 0.5. The average soft-band luminosity is\nL0.5\u22122 keV \u223c 6.4 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121 , for the hard band we find\nL2\u221210 keV \u223c 6 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121 . Thus PG 0844+349 is a\nquasar of rather low luminosity in the X-ray band. Using the\nmonochromatic luminosity at 2 keV we derive an X-ray loud-\n\n5\n\nness \u03b1ox = \u22120.384 log(L2 keV /L\n) \u223c 1.58, which is typ2500\u00c5\nical for average radio-quiet quasars (Yuan et al. 1998).\n\n3. Discussion\nUsing the normalizations of the power law fits the above\nanalysis shows that PG 0844+349 was in a historically high\nstate (see Table 1 of Wang et al. 2000) during the XMMNewton observation, with an average 0.1\u22122.4 keV luminosity\n< 3 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 . Judging from the OM data the object\nof \u223c\nwas optically rather bright as well. An extrapolation of the soft\npower law into the optical band over-predicts the optical flux\nby a factor of \u223c 4, therefore the spectrum must break between\nthe optical and the soft X-ray band. Nevertheless, most of the\npower is emitted in the soft X-ray / UV band. Taking the mass\nestimates for the central black hole from Kaspi et al. (2000)\n(2\u22123\u00d7107M\u2299 ) this implies that PG 0844+349 must be a quite\nefficient accretor. The optical spectrum of PG 0844+349 resembles very much that of NLSy1 galaxies (Boroson & Green\n1992 ) and thus an efficient accretion flow as well as its X-ray\nvariability would be in accordance with current models of these\nAGN.\nThe X-ray spectrum of PG 0844+349 shows a relatively\nflat power law component at higher energies (\u0393hard \u223c 2.25)\n< 2 keV. Both comand a strong, steep soft excess at energies \u223c\nponents are featureless and the inclusion of a broad or a narrow\niron line around 6.7 keV improves the fit only marginally. The\nsoft excess can be modeled with various components resulting in fits with similar statistical significances. The RGS data\ndo not indicate the presence of any spectral feature either. The\nexcess of the soft flux reaches a factor of \u223c2.5 over the extrapolation of the hard power law.\nThis kind of spectrum is not unusual amongst recent\nmeasurements of X-ray spectra of bright Seyferts / quasars\nwith XMM-Newton (O'Brien et al. 2001, Page et al. 2001,\nPounds & Reeves 2002). As a matter of fact, the spectrum\nof PG 0844+349 appears to be a carbon copy of that of the\nNLSy1 galaxy PKS 0558-504 (Pounds & Reeves 2002, Fig.\n1), even with respect to the 'big blue bump' seen in both objects (O'Brien et al. 2001). However, we also note that the\npower law slope of PG 0844+349 is slightly steeper than that\nof PKS 0558-504, which is radio-loud and shows correlations\nbetween X-ray brightness and hardness (Gliozzi et al. 2001),\ncharacteristics not shared by PG 0844+349 .\nThe featureless spectra in these objects indicate that we are\nseeing the bare continuum disk emission from the quasars: thus\ndisk Comptonization models, where the X-rays are produced\nvia inverse Compton emission in a hot corona embedding a\ncooler accretion disk (e.g. Haardt & Maraschi 1993, Pounds\net al. 1995), might provide a satisfactory physical explanation.\nFits with available models for this scenario, however, yield parameters for PG 0844+349 not typically found in other AGN,\nand not statistically preferred according to the above analysis:\nthis might indicate that the actual physical conditions in the\nsources are more complex than our simplified models can account for.\nThe large variety of possible Comptonization scenarios (for\nexample, Haardt 1996, Zycki et al. 2001) does not allow a bet-\n\n\f6\n\nW. Brinkmann et al.: XMM-Newton observations of PG 0844 + 349\n\nter confinement of the parameters in the physical phase space.\nStronger constraints might be deduceable from an analysis of\nthe temporal behavior of the source. PG 0844+349 was known\nto be variable in X-rays from previous ROSAT and ASCA observations, but only XMM-Newton is able to follow the flux\nchanges on the shortest time scales. The X-ray flux (Fig. 1) basically changes during the observation from a higher to a lower\nlevel in a nearly linear fashion and the slopes of the intensity\nvariations are very similar, indicating a rather well organized\nprocess. The light curve shows (for a NLSy1) an atypically low\nvariance and the intensity changes occur without any measurable spectral changes in the X-ray band.\nThe optical image of PG 0844+349 indicates that we are\nseeing the object nearly pole-on and therefore heavy obscuration of the X-ray emitting region appears unlikely. The emission from a jet, changing its geometrical appearance, can very\nlikely be ruled out as the source is definitely radio-quiet, unless we are looking directly into a purely hydrodynamically\noutflowing jet for which there are no other observational indications.\nAchromatic flux changes can result from changes of the\neffective radiating area, ensuring that the spectral shape does\nnot change noticeably. While the temperature of the cold matter does not play a significant role in the models, changes\nin the optical depth \u03c4 give rise to significant spectral variability (Haardt et al. 1997). Most of the theoretical investigations are, however, concentrating on the higher energy part\nof the AGN spectrum (see, for example, Petrucci et al. 2001),\nand the parameter space of relevance here is only poorly explored. In any case, changes of the radiating area are expected\nto happen on the dynamical time scale for Keplerian inflow,\n\u03c4 \u223c 9 103 (r/Rs )3/2 (Mbh /107 M\u2299 ) sec, where Rs is the\nSchwarzschild radius of the central black hole of mass Mbh .\nThis estimate implies a rather low mass for the central black\nhole in PG 0844+349 and a compact emitting region. However,\nstrong variability of Seyferts and Galactic black hole candidates indicates that the corona cannot be a uniform, continuous\nmedium, unless it is geometrically thin (Celotti et al. 1992);\nmoreover, observational evidence implies that the geometry of\nthe coronal plasma cannot be slab like, but is made up of a\nnumber of distinct active regions (Haardt et al. 1994).\nIn a popular class of models the corona is heated by magnetic fields which rise up buoyantly from the disk where they\nreconnect and release their energy in flares. The energy storage in the corona is very likely the magnetic fields (Merloni &\nFabian 2001) and the picture of the corona is that of a spread\nof active regions, of which only a few are large and dominate\nat any given time. The overall time scale of the evolution of the\nmagnetic field configuration is expected to be of the order of\nthe Keplerian time scale again (Romanova et al. 1998) but individual active regions can certainly evolve much more rapidly,\ndepending of the magnetic field configuration and the flow conditions in the disk, which are largely unknown.\n\n4. Conclusions\nIn a 20 ksec XMM-Newton observation the X-ray transient\nquasar PG 0844+349 was found in a historically high X-ray\n\nstate with an average 0.2\u221210 keV luminosity of L0.2\u221210 keV \u223c\n4.5 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 . During the observation the flux of\nPG 0844+349 varied achromatically by \u223c 25% from a higher\ninto a lower flux state in a very smooth manner on a time scale\nof a few thousand seconds.\nThe quasar showed a featureless spectrum which can be\nphysically explained by Comptonization from hot electrons\nof the emission of an accretion disk. The rather low signalto-noise ratio RGS spectra do not indicate the presence of\nany emission or absorption features either. The fitted values\nof the slopes of the power law type spectrum at high energies (\u0393hard \u223c 2.05) and those of the power law in the soft\nband (\u0393soft \u223c 2.75) differ slightly between the EPIC detectors and depend on the complexity of the models fitted to\nthe data. Current Comptonization models predict considerably\nlower temperatures and higher optical depths of the Compton\nscattering electrons than generally found in Seyfert galaxies\nand radio-quiet quasars (see e.g. Petrucci et al. 2001). As\nPG 0844+349 shares many of the characteristics of NLSy1\ngalaxies and similar parameters were recently deduced for\nother NLSy1 galaxies (O'Brien et al. 2001, Page et al. 2001) we\npropose that Comptonization spectra with high optical depths\nand moderate plasma temperatures might be a distinguishing\ncriterion for the accretion process in NLSy1 galaxies.\nMore sensitive XMM-Newton observations and a deeper\ntheoretical exploration of this lower energy and lower temperature parameter space of Comptonization models might shed\nsome new light into the physical properties of these objects.\nAcknowledgements.

In a\n20 ksec XMM-Newton observation the X-ray transient radio-quiet quasar PG 0844+349 was found in\na historically high state compared to previous X-ray observations. The quasar showed a featureless spectrum with a strong\n2:75,\nsoft excess over the extrapolation of a hard power law. Comptonization models or a broken power law with soft\n2:25 and a break energy of Ebreak 1:35 keV represent acceptable descriptions of the spectral continuum. In the\nhard\nComptonization models the temperature of the Comptonizing gas is considerably lower than generally found in (broad line)\nSeyfert galaxies whereas the optical depth is much higher. As a similar behavior has been seen in NLSy1 galaxies, it might be\nan indicator of the different physical conditions in these two classes of AGN. During the XMM-Newton observation the flux of\nPG 0844+349 varied achromatically in a smooth, nearly linear fashion, by 25% on time scales of a few thousand seconds,\nwhich puts some constraints on current models of Comptonizing accretion disk coronae.\n\n\u0018\n\n\u0018\n\n\u0018\n\n\u0018\n\nKey words.

Introduction\nQuasars as a class of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) exhibit\na vast diversity in their observed properties. Some of these,\nlike the radio-loud - radio-quiet dichotomy, can be related to\nthe physical characteristics of the accreting central black hole\nand to morphological differences of the host galaxies. Others\ncan result from specific geometrical conditions of the accretion\nflow and from the particular viewing condition of the observer\nwith respect to the quasar (see, for example, Elvis 2000). In\nmany cases, however, the causes for the unusual properties of\na quasar remain obscure and thus the study of objects displaying atypical characteristics might yield important clues to the\nphysical processes governing the quasar emission.\nOne of the objects with several extraordinary properties\nis PG 0844+349, a well studied nearby (z=0.064), bright\n(mv =14.0), radio-quiet quasar from the Palomar Green sample\n(Schmidt & Green 1983). Deep radio observations reveal no\nnuclear source and the faint detection in the field (S1:49 GHz =\n0:3 mJy) might be related to an R = 20 mag object south-west\nof the quasar (Condon et al. 1987). PG 0844+349 is optically\nquite spectacular: it appears as a barred spiral with complex\nouter structure and a nearly equally bright companion galaxy\n(Hutchings & Crampton 1990). It belongs to the class of AGN\nwith unusually strong Fe II emission (Wang et al. 1996) and according to the optical spectrum displayed in Boroson & Green\n(1992) the source shows all features of a Narrow-Line Seyfert\nSend offprint requests to: W. Brinkmann; e-mail: wpb@rzg.mpg.de\n\n1 galaxy (NLSy1) - strong FeII emission and weak forbidden narrow lines, although its FWHM(H ) = 2420 km s 1 is\nslightly above the often used cut-off line of 2000 km s 1 (e.g.\nOsterbrock & Pogge, 1985). However, this cut-off for the classification of NLSy1s is more artificial than physical, so we still\nmight define this source as a NLSy1 galaxy especially as it\nshows X-ray properties typical for this class of objects, i.e., a\nsteep soft X-ray spectrum and strong variability (for reviews\nsee Boller et al. 2000). It is infrared-loud with a disturbed host\ngalaxy (Clements 2000), and it is strongly variable at all wavelengths on various time scales. The optical flux seems to have\nchanged by \u001870% between 1986 (Elvis et al. 1994) and 1993\n(Maoz et al. 1994) and intra-night variations with amplitudes of\n\u0001B = 0:08 mag were detected by Jang et al. (1997). From reverberation measurements Kaspi et al. (2000) deduced a mass\nof \u0018 2:5 \u0002 107 M for the quasar.\nCompared to the ROSAT All Sky Survey (Yuan et al. 1998)\nthe soft X-ray flux of PG 0844+349 had decreased by a factor\nof \u00186 in a pointed ROSAT observation 6 months later, without any noticeable changes in the spectral slope (Rachen et al.\n1996). During the X-ray low state PG 0844+349 had an Xray loudness of ox > 2, i.e. it could be regarded as 'X-ray\nweak' compared to the average < ox >\u0018 1:6 for radio-quiet\nquasars (Yuan et al. 1998). In an ASCA observation the object\nwas found in a high state, with a photon index of = 1:98 and\na Fe K line with EW \u0018 300 eV. On shorter time scales, the\nX-ray flux in the 2\u201310 keV band is highly variable; the fastest\nvariation detected is 60% in less than 2 \u0002 104 s (Wang et al.\n\n\f2\n\nW. Brinkmann et al.: XMM-Newton observations of PG 0844 + 349\n\n2000). Historic light curves in the X-ray, UV, and optical bands\nindicate that the variability amplitude in the UV and optical\n(up to 70%) is much smaller than in X-rays (up to a factor\nof 10). The optical micro-variability of this object can actually be driven by re-processing of the variable X-ray flux if\nonly half of the absorbed X-rays are re-radiated in the opticalto-UV band. The comparison with Einstein (Kriss 1988) and\nEXOSAT (Malaguti et al. 1994) observations further showed\nthat the quasar can be classified as X-ray weak only in one out\nof five X-ray observations (for details see Wang et al. 2000).\nTo what extent the intensity variations are related to spectral\nchanges is difficult to examine in detail due to the poor statistics\nof the pointed ROSAT/ASCA spectra, especially if significant\nX-ray scattering is present. Corbin & Boroson (1996) mention\nthat the quasar shows 'associated absorption' in an HST spectrum and Wang et al. (2000) claim the existence of narrow associated Ly absorption. There are no HST data for the C IV\nregion, but co-added IUE data suggest C IV absorption consistent in velocity with the Ly absorption.\n\n2. The XMM-Newton observation\nPG 0844+349 was observed by XMM-Newton on November\n5, 2000. The EPIC PN was operated in Full Window mode with\nmedium filter with a total exposure of \u0018 21 ksec. Both MOS\ncameras were in Large Window mode with medium filters as\nwell, each yielding \u0018 23.5 ksec of data. The two RGS chains\nwere operated in Spectroscopy mode, both with exposures of\n\u0018 26 ksec. The OM camera was operated in Imaging mode\nand five images were taken with the U-band filter (300\u2013400\nnm). For the data analysis we used the XMMSAS version 5.2.0\nfor EPIC and OM, and version 5.3.0 for RGS.\n\n2.1. The light curve\nWe determined the 0.5 10 keV PN light curve of\nPG 0844+349 by accumulating the photons in 400 sec bins\nfrom a circular region of radius r = 10000 around the quasar position; for this we selected single and double events with quality flag = 0 (for details of the EPIC detectors see Ehle et al.\n2001). For the MOS data we took singles and doubles (Pattern\n0 12) as well and selected the photons from a circular region\nof radius r = 6000 around the source.\nDuring the observation the background was rather noisy\nwith some strong flares. The total background count rate generally contributes only about 4% of the source count rate.\nHowever, in two flares the background count rate at energies\nabove 3 keV reaches up to 40% of the source count rate and\ncare has to be taken in the spectral analysis. In particular, we\nignore data from the last 2 ksec of the observation as the background count rate becomes very variable then. Since there are\nno differences between PN and MOS light curves, in order to\nincrease the signal-to-noise ratio, we summed up the PN count\nrates (average 6.61 cts/s) and the two MOS count rates (average MOS 1: 1.93 cts/s; MOS 2: 1.94 cts/s). The summed,\nbackground subtracted, EPIC light curve shown in Fig. 1 starts\nat the switch on of the PN camera. There are about 2.5 ksec of\nMOS data previous to that, where the source stays on the same\n\nFig. 1. Background subtracted summed PN + MOS light curve of PG\n0844+349; the time binning is 400 sec.\n\nhigh, flat count rate level. The RGS observation started around\nthe same time as the PN, and lasted some 1.8 ksec longer, well\ninto the period of flaring background.\nThe EPIC count rate (see Fig. 1) starts to decrease after\nabout 4 ksec, recovers for \u0018 2 ksec and then changes by about\n25% to a lower intensity level near the middle of the observation. The flux drops occur in a smooth, nearly linear fashion at a rate of \u0018 6:1 \u0002 10 4 cts s 2 . We will show in the\nnext section that these changes are achromatic to high statistical significance. With the spectral information obtained below,\nthe K-corrected 0.5\u201310 keV luminosity during the first part of\nthe observation is \u0018 2:5 \u0002 1044 erg s 1 . We can use the \u0018\n20% decline of the count rate over \u0018 3500 s near the middle\nof the observation to estimate the lower limit of the radiative\nefficiency, \u0011 > 5 \u0002 10 43 \u0001L=\u0001t (Fabian 1984), and we obtain \u0011 > 7 \u0002 10 3 which is far below the theoretical limit for a\nSchwarzschild black hole.\nThe OM provided U-filter images integrated for \u0018 4000 s\neach. The brightness of the source, obtained from the Pipeline\nProcessing System (PPS), stayed approximately constant at\n14.00 mag; the largest deviation from this average value occured during the period \u0018 2\u20136 ksec after the start of the PN exposure, during the first intensity dip, when the source was 0.01\nmag fainter than the average. This is, however, only a \u0018 1:5\u001b\neffect which implies that any variations of the optical flux are\nnegligible compared to the changes in the X-ray band.\n\n2.2. Spectral properties\nFor the EPIC spectral analysis we used the latest available response matrices (version 6.1) issued in December 2001. For the\nPN camera we extracted single and double events with quality\nflag = 0 from a circular region with a radius of 4500 around the\nsource position. This radius includes \u0018 88% of the source photons (Ghizzardi & Molendi 2001) but avoids the gap between\nthe detector chips. The background was taken on the same chip\n> 7 cts s 1 in\nat a similar offset position. With a count rate of \u0018\nthe high state the PN detector, operated in Full Window mode,\nshowed strong indications of pile-up, clearly apparent from the\n\n\fW. Brinkmann et al.: XMM-Newton observations of PG 0844 + 349\n\nFig. 2. Broken power law fit to the total PN + combined MOS data of\nPG 0844+349; the PN spectrum is the upper curve.\n\nXMMSAS task epatplot. We therefore discarded photons from\nthe innermost 3 \u0002 3 RAW pixels at the core of the point spread\nfunction from the spectral analysis. As a consequence, the normalizations of the models in the PN fits given in Table 1 are\nunderestimating the actual photon flux. Further, we discarded\nthe data of the last \u0018 2 ksec of the observation, when the background was strongly flaring, and we excluded times of high\nbackground, i.e. greater than 50 cts/s, from the Good Time\nIntervals (GTI) file. However, this last selection criterion influenced the quality of the fits only marginally. For the two MOS\ncameras we selected events with pattern \u0014 12 and flag = 0 and\na similar extraction radius as for the PN; the background was\ntaken from an area on the same chips near the source. Pile-up\ndid not influence the spectral fits of the MOS data noticeably;\ntherefore the full data were used.\nThe RGS spectra of PG 0844+349 were accumulated by\nselecting counts from a region centered on the source position\nand enclosing 90% of the point spread function in the cross\ndispersion direction, and making the first order selection by\nincluding 90% of the expected CCD pulse height distribution\nof the source photons. The background spectrum was obtained\nfrom two spatial regions excluding 95% of the source point\nspread function in the cross dispersion direction and performing the same order selection as for the source.\nWhile the ASCA high state data could be well fitted by\na simple absorbed power law (Wang et al. 2000), this model\ndoes not provide an acceptable fit to the PN data from the first,\nhigh state part of the observation. With a reduced \u001f2 = 1:42\nthe fitted power law index is\n= 2:57 and the residuals\nclearly show that at higher energies the spectrum gets flatter.\nA broken power law, fixing the absorption at the Galactic value\nNH = 3:32 \u0002 1020 cm 2 (Lockman & Savage 1995), gives an\nacceptable fit to the PN data with a reduced \u001f2 = 1:03 for\n372 d.o.f. (see Table 1). Fitting the same time interval with the\nMOS1 and the MOS 2 data separately yielded similar acceptable fits. The fit parameters in Table 1 indicate that the two\nMOS spectra have nearly identical power law slopes. In both\nMOS cameras the residuals at the lowest energies show an Sshaped pattern with a maximum at \u0018 0:5 keV, while the PN fits,\n\n3\n\nwith generally slightly flatter power laws and a higher break\nenergy, show systematic positive residuals at \u0018 0:6 keV.\nApplying the same model to the low state, i.e. the period between 10 and 19 ksec after the start of the observation, gave an\nacceptable fit with nearly identical parameters, with the same\n'typical' differences between the three detectors as above (see\nTable 1).\nWe repeated the fit over several other, shorter time intervals\nduring the observation and always obtained acceptable fits with\nvery similar parameters. We thus conclude that no statistically\nsignificant spectral variations occur during the flux changes of\nthe source. Therefore for the subsequent fits we used the data\nfrom the full observation, again excluding the last 2 ksec and\ntimes of high background.\nFig.2 shows the simultaneous broken power law fit to the\nwhole data set for the PN and the combined MOS instruments.\nDue to the slight differences between the PN and MOS cameras, visible at \u0018 0.5\u20130.6 keV and at higher energies, the quality of the fit is only moderate (\u001f2red = 1:11 for 1006 d.o.f.).\nAdding a Gaussian iron line does not improve the fit, mainly\nbecause of the low statistical significance of the data at higher\nenergies. We therefore fitted the PN data separately for the 2\u20139\nkeV range with a single power law and, secondly, with a power\nlaw plus a Gaussian line. We find a broad line at an energy\nof 6.25\u00060.13 keV (El;rest = 6:65 \u0006 0:13 keV in the quasar's\nrest frame) and an equivalent width of \u0018 235 eV. For a narrow\nline (i.e. fixing the Gaussian sigma at 10 eV) we get the same\nline energy and an equivalent width of \u0018 120 eV. Including the\nlines improves the quality of the fits marginally (see Table 1),\nbut only at a \u0018 94% confidence level, according to an F-test.\nThe small equivalent width found is atypical for NLSy1 galaxies, for which BeppoSax (Comastri 2000) and ASCA (Turner\net al. 1998) generally find ionized iron lines with large equivalent widths (few 100 eV).\nThe moderate quality of the combined PN and MOS fits\nand the fit residuals can be explained as resulting from the\nremaining uncertainties in the detector calibrations. However,\nthey might also indicate that the chosen spectral model can be\nimproved.\nIn Fig. 3 we show the power law fit to the total PN data\nfor the 2 10 keV range, extrapolated to lower energies. The\nslope of \u0018 2:04, consistent with ASCA, is probably not affected by contributions of more complex models for the low\nenergy part of the spectrum. The ratio between the data and\nthe model clearly shows the 'gradual soft excess' (Pounds &\nReeves 2002) also found in other AGN with the high sensitivity and large bandwidth of XMM-Newton. While the hard\npower law tail seems to be well constrained, the exact shape\nof the spectrum at low energies remains uncertain. We therefore tried several composite models, mainly to characterize the\nsofter part of the spectrum.\nModels including a thermal component in addition to the\nhard power law fit the data quite well, as shown in Table 1;\nthe relative contribution of the power law component can be\ninferred from the listed normalization. The power law + bbody\nfit provides two solutions: one in which the power law component represents the hard flux, the black body temperature is\nsimilar to that of the diskbbody and another, perhaps less phys-\n\n\f4\n\nW.

All models are statistically acceptable (although the above\nmentioned systematic residuals at \u0018 0.6 keV persist in all fits)\nand therefore the physical nature of the soft emission remains\nunclear.\nAs the fitted slope of the spectrum at higher energies seems\nto harden with energy we tried to fit a curved continuum model\n(Fossati et al. 2000) but no good fit could be achieved. We further tried several composite cases fixing the hard power law\nindex at the best fit slope of the 2 10 keV fit but we never\nobtained an acceptable fit: this seems to indicate that the hard\npower law is only the tail of a distribution and not a separate\ncomponent.\n\nFig. 4.

A fit with the\nXspec Comptonization model omptt (Titarchuk 1994) failed\nto reproduce the hard power law and resulted in an unacceptable fit (\u001f2red = 1:97). Adding a hard power law to the omptt\nmodel (\u001f2red = 1:09=1094 d.o.f) or fitting the sum of two\nComptonization models with different temperatures and optical depths of the scattering medium (\u001f2red = 1:11=1093 d.o.f)\nresulted in fits nearly as good as the models in Table 1. For the\ndouble - omptt fit we either assumed the same temperature for\nthe two soft photon components or left them free to vary independently. In all three cases the bulk of the flux up to \u0018 3 keV\noriginates from Comptonization of soft photons off a gas of kT\n\u0018 4.5 keV and optical depth \u001c \u0018 2:4. The high energy part of\nthe spectrum is formed either by the power law component or\n\n\fW. Brinkmann et al.: XMM-Newton observations of PG 0844 + 349\n\nthe second Comptonization component with kT\u0018 16 keV and\n\u0018 3:3. The temperatures of the soft photons were fitted to\nbe kT0 = 65+99\n65 eV in case of the extra power law component, kT0 = 3+71\n3 eV (using the same values for the two soft\n+341\ncomponents) and kT0 (1) = 12+169\n12 eV and kT0(2) = 2 2\neV for the case of two independent soft components, respectively. The temperatures of the Comptonizing electrons are at\nthe low end of the expected temperature range for AGN (Haardt\n& Maraschi 1993) while the fitted optical depths are higher\nthan usually deduced. The temperatures of the soft photons appear rather low; however, the parameters are very poorly constrained because of the close coupling of temperature and optical depth in the Comptonization models. Interestingly, the high\noptical depth implies that any reflection features (like the iron\nline) are suppressed by Compton scattering in the corona itself\n(Matt et al. 1997).\n\n\u001c\n\nThe superior energy resolution of the RGS data could provide an ultimate test for the nature of the soft emission. The\nsame composite models tried on the PN data alone (see Table\n1) were fitted simultaneously to the RGS1 and RGS2 spectra, as well as to the PN. The hard power law slope and the\ntemperature of the soft component were kept fix at the best fit\nvalue obtained from the fits of the PN alone, and the normalizations for the three instruments were allowed to vary independently of each other (because of the PN data selection used\nto avoid pile-up). The low energy absorption column was fixed\nat the Galactic value. Values of \u001f2red /dof very similar to those\nin Table 1 for the PN alone were obtained (in the range 0.98\u2013\n1.05/841), with the formally best fit model being the combination of a power law and a bremsstrahlung component. This best\nfit and the data are shown in Fig.4; the fit of the pow/diskbb and\npow/mekal are virtually indistinguishable from this. Although\nthe signal-to-noise ratio of the RGS data is only moderate, it is\nclear that there is no evidence of emission or absorption structures in the spectrum, indicating the absence of any additional\nsource intrinsic absorbers. In particular, there is no evidence of\nexcess emission in the RGS at \u00180.6 keV which could explain\nthe amplitude and the shape of the residuals observed in the PN\nfit.\nIn the following, we use the broken power law model for\nthe determination of the source's energetics; however, it should\nbe kept in mind that this is a rather artificial representation of\nthe source's spectrum and that at the lowest energies the flux\ndistribution might be quite different from a simple power law,\nintroducing some uncertainty in the numerical values.\nThe observed average un-absorbed flux in the high state in\nthe 0.2\u201310.0 keV range amounts to 2.6\u000210 11erg cm 2 s 1 ,\nwhile the average in the low state is 2.1\u000210 11erg cm 2 s 1 .\nWith these fluxes the K-corrected X-ray luminosity of\nPG 0844+349 is in the range L0:2 10 keV = (4:1 4:9) \u0002 1044\nerg s 1 , using a Friedman cosmology with H0 = 50 km s 1\nMpc 1 and q0 = 0.5. The average soft-band luminosity is\nL0:5 2 keV \u0018 6:4 \u0002 1043 erg s 1 , for the hard band we find\nL2 10 keV \u0018 6 \u0002 1043 erg s 1 . Thus PG 0844+349 is a\nquasar of rather low luminosity in the X-ray band. Using the\nmonochromatic luminosity at 2 keV we derive an X-ray loud-\n\n5\n\nness ox = 0:384 log(L2 keV =L\n2500\u00c5 ) \u0018 1:58, which is typical for average radio-quiet quasars (Yuan et al. 1998).\n\n3. Discussion\nUsing the normalizations of the power law fits the above\nanalysis shows that PG 0844+349 was in a historically high\nstate (see Table 1 of Wang et al. 2000) during the XMMNewton observation, with an average 0.1 2.4 keV luminosity\n< 3 \u0002 1044 erg s 1 . Judging from the OM data the object\nof \u0018\nwas optically rather bright as well. An extrapolation of the soft\npower law into the optical band over-predicts the optical flux\nby a factor of \u0018 4, therefore the spectrum must break between\nthe optical and the soft X-ray band. Nevertheless, most of the\npower is emitted in the soft X-ray / UV band. Taking the mass\nestimates for the central black hole from Kaspi et al. (2000)\n(2 3\u0002107M ) this implies that PG 0844+349 must be a quite\nefficient accretor. The optical spectrum of PG 0844+349 resembles very much that of NLSy1 galaxies (Boroson & Green\n1992 ) and thus an efficient accretion flow as well as its X-ray\nvariability would be in accordance with current models of these\nAGN.\nThe X-ray spectrum of PG 0844+349 shows a relatively\nflat power law component at higher energies ( hard \u0018 2:25)\n< 2 keV. Both comand a strong, steep soft excess at energies \u0018\nponents are featureless and the inclusion of a broad or a narrow\niron line around 6.7 keV improves the fit only marginally. The\nsoft excess can be modeled with various components resulting in fits with similar statistical significances. The RGS data\ndo not indicate the presence of any spectral feature either. The\nexcess of the soft flux reaches a factor of \u00182.5 over the extrapolation of the hard power law.\nThis kind of spectrum is not unusual amongst recent\nmeasurements of X-ray spectra of bright Seyferts / quasars\nwith XMM-Newton (O'Brien et al. 2001, Page et al. 2001,\nPounds & Reeves 2002). As a matter of fact, the spectrum\nof PG 0844+349 appears to be a carbon copy of that of the\nNLSy1 galaxy PKS 0558-504 (Pounds & Reeves 2002, Fig.\n1), even with respect to the 'big blue bump' seen in both objects (O'Brien et al. 2001). However, we also note that the\npower law slope of PG 0844+349 is slightly steeper than that\nof PKS 0558-504, which is radio-loud and shows correlations\nbetween X-ray brightness and hardness (Gliozzi et al. 2001),\ncharacteristics not shared by PG 0844+349 .\nThe featureless spectra in these objects indicate that we are\nseeing the bare continuum disk emission from the quasars: thus\ndisk Comptonization models, where the X-rays are produced\nvia inverse Compton emission in a hot corona embedding a\ncooler accretion disk (e.g. Haardt & Maraschi 1993, Pounds\net al. 1995), might provide a satisfactory physical explanation.\nFits with available models for this scenario, however, yield parameters for PG 0844+349 not typically found in other AGN,\nand not statistically preferred according to the above analysis:\nthis might indicate that the actual physical conditions in the\nsources are more complex than our simplified models can account for.\nThe large variety of possible Comptonization scenarios (for\nexample, Haardt 1996, Zycki et al. 2001) does not allow a bet-\n\n\f6\n\nW. Brinkmann et al.: XMM-Newton observations of PG 0844 + 349\n\nter confinement of the parameters in the physical phase space.\nStronger constraints might be deduceable from an analysis of\nthe temporal behavior of the source. PG 0844+349 was known\nto be variable in X-rays from previous ROSAT and ASCA observations, but only XMM-Newton is able to follow the flux\nchanges on the shortest time scales. The X-ray flux (Fig. 1) basically changes during the observation from a higher to a lower\nlevel in a nearly linear fashion and the slopes of the intensity\nvariations are very similar, indicating a rather well organized\nprocess. The light curve shows (for a NLSy1) an atypically low\nvariance and the intensity changes occur without any measurable spectral changes in the X-ray band.\nThe optical image of PG 0844+349 indicates that we are\nseeing the object nearly pole-on and therefore heavy obscuration of the X-ray emitting region appears unlikely. The emission from a jet, changing its geometrical appearance, can very\nlikely be ruled out as the source is definitely radio-quiet, unless we are looking directly into a purely hydrodynamically\noutflowing jet for which there are no other observational indications.\nAchromatic flux changes can result from changes of the\neffective radiating area, ensuring that the spectral shape does\nnot change noticeably. While the temperature of the cold matter does not play a significant role in the models, changes\nin the optical depth \u001c give rise to significant spectral variability (Haardt et al. 1997). Most of the theoretical investigations are, however, concentrating on the higher energy part\nof the AGN spectrum (see, for example, Petrucci et al. 2001),\nand the parameter space of relevance here is only poorly explored. In any case, changes of the radiating area are expected\nto happen on the dynamical time scale for Keplerian inflow,\n\u001c \u0018 9 103 (r=Rs )3=2 (Mbh =107 M ) sec, where Rs is the\nSchwarzschild radius of the central black hole of mass Mbh .\nThis estimate implies a rather low mass for the central black\nhole in PG 0844+349 and a compact emitting region. However,\nstrong variability of Seyferts and Galactic black hole candidates indicates that the corona cannot be a uniform, continuous\nmedium, unless it is geometrically thin (Celotti et al. 1992);\nmoreover, observational evidence implies that the geometry of\nthe coronal plasma cannot be slab like, but is made up of a\nnumber of distinct active regions (Haardt et al. 1994).\nIn a popular class of models the corona is heated by magnetic fields which rise up buoyantly from the disk where they\nreconnect and release their energy in flares. The energy storage in the corona is very likely the magnetic fields (Merloni &\nFabian 2001) and the picture of the corona is that of a spread\nof active regions, of which only a few are large and dominate\nat any given time. The overall time scale of the evolution of the\nmagnetic field configuration is expected to be of the order of\nthe Keplerian time scale again (Romanova et al. 1998) but individual active regions can certainly evolve much more rapidly,\ndepending of the magnetic field configuration and the flow conditions in the disk, which are largely unknown.\n\n4. Conclusions\nIn a 20 ksec XMM-Newton observation the X-ray transient\nquasar PG 0844+349 was found in a historically high X-ray\n\nstate with an average 0.2 10 keV luminosity of L0:2 10 keV \u0018\n4:5 \u0002 1044 erg s 1 . During the observation the flux of\nPG 0844+349 varied achromatically by \u0018 25% from a higher\ninto a lower flux state in a very smooth manner on a time scale\nof a few thousand seconds.\nThe quasar showed a featureless spectrum which can be\nphysically explained by Comptonization from hot electrons\nof the emission of an accretion disk. The rather low signalto-noise ratio RGS spectra do not indicate the presence of\nany emission or absorption features either. The fitted values\nof the slopes of the power law type spectrum at high energies ( hard \u0018 2:05) and those of the power law in the soft\nband ( soft \u0018 2:75) differ slightly between the EPIC detectors and depend on the complexity of the models fitted to\nthe data. Current Comptonization models predict considerably\nlower temperatures and higher optical depths of the Compton\nscattering electrons than generally found in Seyfert galaxies\nand radio-quiet quasars (see e.g. Petrucci et al. 2001). As\nPG 0844+349 shares many of the characteristics of NLSy1\ngalaxies and similar parameters were recently deduced for\nother NLSy1 galaxies (O'Brien et al. 2001, Page et al. 2001) we\npropose that Comptonization spectra with high optical depths\nand moderate plasma temperatures might be a distinguishing\ncriterion for the accretion process in NLSy1 galaxies.\nMore sensitive XMM-Newton observations and a deeper\ntheoretical exploration of this lower energy and lower temperature parameter space of Comptonization models might shed\nsome new light into the physical properties of these objects.\nAcknowledgements.
