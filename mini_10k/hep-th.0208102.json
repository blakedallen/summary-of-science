We construct a field theory model in which such a\nblack hole is described as a massive scalar particle with internal degrees of freedom. In this model,\nthe probability of transition between the different internal levels followed by emission of massless\nquanta is identical to the probability of thermal emission calculated for the Schwarzschild black\nhole. The discussed recoil effect implies that the thermal emission of the black holes, which might\nbe created by interaction of high energy particles in colliders, could be terminated and the energy\nnon-conservation can be observed in the brane experiments.\n\nA common feature of all brane world models with large\nor infinite extra dimensions [1,2] is that a lot of new interesting phenomena can be expected at the energy scale\nnot much above the energy currently available in accelerators. Probably the most interesting and intriguing is\nthe possibility of production of mini black holes in future\ncollider and cosmic rays experiments. Preliminary calculations [3,4] indicate that the probability for creation of\na mini black hole in near future hadron colliders such as\nLHC (Large Hadron Collider) is so high that they can be\ncalled \"black hole factories\". Also, mini black holes produced by ultra high energy cosmic rays could be observed\nat the Auger Observatory before LHC starts operating\n[5].\nAfter the black hole is formed (either at LHC or the\nAuger Observatory), it decays by emitting Hawking radiation. Thermal Hawking radiation consists of particles propagating along the brane, and the bulk radiation. Usually the bulk radiation is neglected since the\ntotal number of species which are confined on the brane\nis quite large (\u223c 60, see e.g. [3,6]). It should be noted\nthat when the number of extra dimensions is greater than\n1 this argument may not work. Really, the number of degrees of freedom of gravitons in the (N + 1)-dimensional\nspace-time is N = (N + 1)(N \u2212 2)/2. For example, for\nN + 1 = 7 (3 extra dimensions) N = 14.\nIt is also very important that mini black holes created\nin the high energy scattering are expected to have high\nangular momentum and to be extremal or close to them.\nFor this reason, the effect of superradiance must be important. The superradiant emission is dominated by the\nparticles with the highest spin, that is by gravitons. This\neffect was studied in (3 + 1)-dimensional space-time by\nDon Page [7] (see also [8]). He demonstrated that for\nan extremely rotating black hole the probability of emission of a graviton by an extremely rotating black hole is\nabout 100 times higher than the probability of emission\nof a photon or neutrino. We may expect that this conclusion remains valid for higher-dimensional black hole\nso that the bulk radiation may be comparable with (or\neven dominate) the radiation along the brane.\nBut even for small number of extra dimensions the\n\nrole of bulk graviton emission might be important. As a\nresult of the emission of the graviton into the bulk space,\nthe black hole recoil can move the black hole out of the\nbrane. Black hole radiation would be terminated and an\nobserver located on the brane would register the virtual\nenergy non-conservation.\nSince the problem in its complete scope is very complicated we make some simplifying assumptions. We assume\nthat the characteristic size of extra dimensions is much\nlarger than the Schwarzschild radius of the black hole,\nso that we can effectively describe the black hole by a\nhigher dimensional Schwarzschild solution.\nIn our model, the center-of-mass motion of black hole\nof mass M , in D = N + 1 space-time dimensions, is\ndescribed by a scalar wave function \u03a6 with an action\nZ\n\u0003\n\u0002\n1\nW =\u2212\n(1)\ndD x (\u2207\u03a6)2 + M 2 \u03a62 ,\n2\nand obeying the equation \u2737\u03a6 \u2212 M 2 \u03a6 = 0 .\nWe use the following mode decomposition for the quantum field \u03a6\u0302\nZ\nh\ni\ndN P\n1\n\u2212i\u03c9P t+iP X\nA\n\u221a\ne\n\u00c2(P)\n+\nh.c.\n\u03a6\u0302(X ) =\n2\u03c9P (2\u03c0)N/2\n(2)\nwhere h.c. stands\n\u221a for hermitian conjugate. The bulk\nenergy is \u03c9P = P2 + M 2 . Here and later we use the\nfollowing notation: P A (A = 1, ..., N ) is total bulk momentum which has components pik (i = 1, 2, 3) along the\nbrane, and pa\u22a5 (a = 1, ..., N \u2212 3) in the bulk direction.\nWe also denote xi coordinated along the brane, and y a\nbulk coordinates. Thus, P X = pk x + p\u22a5 y.In the case\nwhere there is no brane, all the space-like dimensions are\nequivalent.\nSimilarly, we write the mode decomposition for the\nbulk massless scalar field \u03c6\nZ N\n\u0002 \u2212i\u03c9t+iK X\n\u0003\nd K\n1\n\u221a\n\u03c6\u0302(X A ) =\ne\n\u00e2(K)\n+\nh.c.\n.\n2\u03c9 (2\u03c0)N/2\n(3)\n1\n\n\f1/M\u2217N \u22121 is a fundamental gravitational constant determined by a fundamental energy scale M\u2217 .\nComparing (6) with (7) one can conclude that if we\nwant a decaying massive particle M to emit massless\nquanta with the same probability as an evaporating black\nhole in the low frequency approximation one must choose\n\nHere \u03c9 = K = |K| is the bulk energy.\nWe choose the interaction action in the following form\nZ\nX\nWint =\n\u03bbIJ\ndX D \u03a6\u0302I (X) \u03a6\u0302J (X) \u03c6\u0302(X) .\n(4)\nI6=J\n\n\u03bbIJ is the coupling constant between the two different\ninternal states. We characterize these states I by the\nvalue of black hole mass MI . Emission of quanta of a\nbulk field \u03c6 by the black hole changes its mass and hence\nprovides a transition I \u2192 J to the lower energy state\nJ. The amplitude of probability AJK,I of the particle\n(\"black hole\") transition from the initial state I to the\nfinal state J with emission of a massless quantum K is\n\n\u039b2 (M 2 , M 2 \u2212 2M \u03c9) =\n\n(2\u03c0)N \u22121\nM R0N \u22122\n,\n\u03c0 N/2 2N \u22123 \u0393(N/2) e\u03b2\u03c9R0 \u2212 1\n(8)\n\nThis result is valid for any (N + 1)-dimensional black\nhole which can be considered as a point radiator and is\nindependent from the brane world models.

The pattern\nof such a black hole decay is markedly different from any\nother standard model event. There exist very detailed\ncalculations estimating the energy spectrum and ratio\nbetween emitted particles (leptons, fotons, hadrons etc.)\n[4] . It is also claimed that, because of very little missing\nenergy, the determination of the mass and the temperature of the black hole may lead to a test of Hawking's\n\nPerforming integrations using (8) and the fact that the\nmain contribution to the integrals comes from the low\nfrequency modes (the high frequency ones are suppressed\nby a thermal factor) give the following result for wof f in\nN = 4:\np\nZ \u221e\n1\n\u03c72 ( \u03c72 + \u03bd 2 \u2212 \u03bd)\n\u03bc\np\n.\nd\u03c7\nwof f (\u03bd) =\n2\n2\n8\u03c0 2 \u03bd 0\nexp(\u03c7)\n\u22121\n\u03c7 +\u03bd\n3\n\n\fPage and Glenn Starkman for stimulating discussions.\nThis work was partly supported by the Natural Sciences\nand Engineering Research Council of Canada.

Certainly the most important\nobservable effect of a black hole recoil is a suddenly disrupted evaporation and local non-conservation of energy.\nWe developed a phenomenological model for description of the recoil effect. This model contains an important parameter \u03bc which play the role of the chemical potential. In the general case, \u03bc depends on the\nmass of a black hole M and the tension \u03c3 of the brane,\n\u03bc = \u03bc(M, \u03c3). Unfortunately, to determine this dependence is not an easy task. One can expect that in the\nlimit \u03c3 \u2192 0, that is for a test brane, \u03bc \u2192 0. In this case,\nit is very likely that the black hole leaves the brane as\nsoon as emits first quanta with non-zero bulk momentum\n(see Fig. 1).\nWe can also estimate \u03bc for small \u03c3 as follows. Consider\ntwo different states: first, a brane with a black hole of\nradius R0 , and the second, when the same black hole is\nout of the brane. The second configuration has extra\nenergy \u2206E \u223c \u03c3R03 (for 1 extra dimension). One can\nidentify \u2206E with M \u2212 M\u0303 . This gives \u03bc2 \u2248 2M \u2206E , (see\n5/2\n5/4\neq. (10)) or \u03bc \u223c \u03c3 1/2 R0 \u223c \u03c3 1/2 M0 .\nIn the other limit of infinitely heavy brane, or a brane\nwith Z2 symmetry, the process of a black hole leaving\nthe brane reminds to a black hole splitting into two symmetric black holes in the \"mirror\" space. Classically this\nprocess is forbidden in a higher dimensional space-time\nfor the same reason as in (3 + 1)-dimensional space-time\nin connection with non-decreasing property of the entropy. In the presence of cosmological constant, such an\neffect may become possible as a tunneling process. These\narguments show that in this case \u03bc \u2192 \u221e or is exponentially large, and the recoil effect is suppressed. This\nfeature could help in distinguishing between the two different scenarios of compact and infinite extra dimensions.\nAlso, if the general conclusion that the recoil effect may\nbe important for branes of small tension is correct, it\nopens an interesting possibility of using the experiments\nwith decay of mini black holes to put restrictions on the\nbrane tension.\nThe above order of magnitude estimates of the parameter \u03bc do not follow from the exact calculations and therefore further investigation is required\u2217 .\n\n[1] N.
