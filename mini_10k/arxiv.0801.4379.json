INTRODUCTION\n\nIt is a main theme in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) studies to describe various AGN phenomena within coherent\nschemes. The broad absorption line quasars (BALQSOs) and\nradio quasars (RQs) are both subsamples of quasars, where\nBALQSOs exhibit blue-shifted rest-frame ultra-violet absorption troughs (e.g., Weymann et al. 1991) and RQs are characterized by their radio emission (e.g., Matthews & Sandage\n1963; Schmidt 1963; Kellermann et al. 1989). The fractions\nof BALQSOs and RQs are the subjects of many studies (e.g.,\nWeymann et al. 1991; Hewett & Foltz 2003; White et al.\n2007). Recently, Dai et al. (2007, DSS hereafter), adopting the classical Balnicity Index (BI) definition (Weymann\net al. 1991) which selects as BALQSOs those sources with\nabsorption troughs wider than 2000 km s\u22121, obtained an intrinsic BALQSO fraction of (20 \u00b1 0.2)% using the BALQSOs detected in the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS)\nand in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 3\n(DR3) BALQSO catalog of Trump et al. (2006). DSS showed\nthat the BALQSO fraction calculated in the infrared is significantly higher by a factor of \u223c 2 than that inferred from\noptical samples alone. Since the infrared bands are less affected by selection effects due to dust extinction and absorption troughs, DSS concluded that the infrared fractions should\nbe much closer to the true intrinsic fractions of BALQSOs.\nThe intrinsic fraction from DSS is consistent with the early\nestimate by Hewett & Foltz (1993) inferred by directly correcting the obscuration effects in the optical bands, and subse1 Department of Astronomy, The Ohio State University, Columbus,\nOH 43210, shankar@astronomy.ohio-state.edu, xinyu@astronomy.ohiostate.edu, sivakoff@astronomy.ohio-state.edu\n\nquent analysis using similar methods by Knigge et al. (2008).\nIn addition, such a a high intrinsic fraction has been recently\nconfirmed by Maddox et al. (2008), from a deeper sample\nconstructed from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey Early\nData Release, which probes about three magnitudes fainter\nthan 2MASS. DSS also showed that an intrinsic BALQSO\nfraction of 43% is found when adopting the broader Absorption Index (AI) classification by Trump et al. (2006) which\nidentifies BALQSOs as those quasars with absorption troughs\nwhich have an equivalent width (measured between 0 and\n29000 km s\u22121 ) greater than 1000 km s\u22121. The validity of the\nlatter definition has however been recently questioned (e.g.,\nGanguly et al. 2007; Knigge et al. 2008), and in this paper we\nwill therefore discuss results adopting both definitions.\nOn the other hand, recent results on the fraction of RQs in\noptical samples are between 10\u201320%, depending on the definition (e.g., Sikora et al. 2007 and references therein). In\nseveral studies, the RQ fraction is found to depend on the\nredshift and optical luminosity (e.g., Jiang et al. 2007). In\ngeneral, constraining the intrinsic fractions of BALQSOs and\nRQs in large, complete quasar samples, is important for understanding the nature of these phenomena such as their efficiency and/or black hole spin distributions (e.g., Murray et al.\n1995; Sikora et al. 2007; Shankar et al. 2008b), and helping\nconstrain AGN and galaxy evolutionary models (e.g., King\n2003; Croton et al. 2006; Granato et al. 2006; Hopkins et al.\n2006; Lapi et al. 2006; Shankar et al. 2006).\nThe fraction of BALQSOs in RQs is particularly interesting as it may further constrain which quasar sub-samples are\ncaused by geometrical viewing effects and which are caused\nby evolutionary effects, as well as provide additional clues on\nthe nature and connections between these two apparently dis-\n\n\f2\nconnected quasar phenomena. In a pioneer study, Stocke et al.\n(1992) found no evidence for luminous radio sources among\n68 BALQSOs. In a sample of 255 radio sources in the Large\nBright QSO Survey, Francis et al. (1993) noted that the fraction of radio-moderate quasars with BAL features was significantly higher than in the radio-quiet population. Brotherton et\nal. (1998) found five BALQSOs in a complete sample of 111\nQSO candidates also detected in the NRAO VLA Sky Survey.\nUsing the FIRST Bright Quasar Survey, Becker et al. (2000)\nfound 29 BALQSOs, about 14\u201318% of their total sample, suggesting a frequency of BALQSOs significantly greater than\nthe typical \u223c 10% inferred from optically selected samples at\nthat time. Within the small sample, they also found that the\nBALQSO fraction has a complex dependence on radio loudness. However, the trend they found was driven by the 11 lowionization BALQSOs, whereas the 18 high-ionization BALQSOs were slightly under-represented at high radio loudness,\nbut at a statistically insignificant level. With a larger sample of 25 high-ionization and 6 low-ionization BALQSOs selected from an extension of the FIRST Bright Quasar Survey\nto the South Galactic cap and to a fainter optical magnitude\nlimit, Becker et al. (2001) confirmed the results by Becker\net al. (2000) of a steady decrease of the high-ionization\nBALQSO. Using the Large Bright Quasar Survey, Hewett and\nFoltz (2003) argued that with a consistent BALQSO definition there is no inconsistency in the BALQSO fractions between optically-selected and radio-selected quasar samples.\nThey also found that \"optically-bright BALQSOs are half as\nlikely as non-BALQSOs to be detectable S1.4GHz & 1 mJy as\nradio sources\". In this paper, we combined the SDSS-DR3\nBALQSO sample (Trump et al. 2006), containing more than\n4,000 BALQSOs, with the FIRST survey data (Becker et al.\n1995) to study the fraction of BALQSOs in the radio detected\nsample.\n\n1984). Our results do not qualitatively change if we assume\neither \u03b1 = 0.5 or \u03b1 = 1.0.\nAccording to Schneider et al. (2005), while only a small\nminority of FIRST-SDSS matches are chance superpositions,\na significant fraction of the DR3 sources are extended radio\nsources. Therefore the FIRST catalog position for the latter may differ by more than 2\u2032\u2032 from the optical position. To\nperform a comprehensive study of the BALQSO radio fraction, we built a full FIRST-SDSS cross-correlation catalog,\ncontaining all the detected radio components within 30\u2032\u2032 of a\noptical quasar. As our reference, following Schneider et al.\n(2005), we primarily present results for the FIRST-SDSS catalog with radio counterparts defined within 2\u2032\u2032 , which contains\na total of 652 radio sources, out of which 78 are BALQSOs,\nabout three times the sample used by Becker et al. (2001)\nfor BALQSOs. We will discuss results obtained by enlarging the radio matches to 5\u2032\u2032 . In addition, many of the optical sources in SDSS are associated to more than one radio\ncomponent in FIRST within 30\u2032\u2032 , as expected if these sources\nare extended with jets and/or lobes separated from the central\nsource. We will therefore discuss results after the inclusion\nof BALQSO sources characterized by multiple radio components, for which we use the sum of the flux densities as a\nproxy for the total radio luminosity of the source.\nFinally, we also stress that FIRST efficiently identifies radio\nmatches to optically-selected quasars. By cross-correlating\nSDSS with the large radio NRAO VLA Sky Survey (Condon\net al. 1998), Jiang et al. (2007) found in fact that only \u223c 6%\nof the matched quasars were not detected by FIRST. Most of\nthese sources have offsets more than 5\u2032\u2032 and are uniformly distributed in luminosity thus not altering the main conclusions\nof this paper.\n\n2. THE DATA\n\n3.1. The Radio fraction of BALQSOs\nThe solid crosses in the left panel of Figure 1 show the fraction\nNBAL,RADIO\n,\n(2)\nfBAL =\nNRADIO\n\nThe parent sample for the Trump et al. (2006) BALQSO\ncatalog is the SDSS DR3 quasar catalog (Schneider et al.\n2005). Data were taken in five broad optical bands (ugriz)\nover about 10,000 deg2 of the high Galactic latitude sky. The\nmajority of quasars were selected for spectroscopic followup\nby SDSS based on their optical photometry. In particular,\nmost quasar candidates were selected by their location in the\nlow-redshift (z . 3) ugri color cube with its i-magnitude limit\nof 19.1. A second higher redshift griz color cube was also\nused with a fainter i-magnitude limit of 20.2. Following DSS,\nwe focus on redshift range of 1.7 \u2264 z \u2264 4.38, where BALQSOs are identified by C IV absorption in the SDSS spectra.\nIn the following we present results using both the AI and BI\ndefinitions for BALQSOs.\nThe DR3 quasar catalog by Schneider et al. (2005) also\nprovides the radio flux for those sources which have a counterpart within 2\u2032\u2032 in the FIRST catalog (Becker et al. 1995).\nHowever, we use the integrated flux density observed at 1.4\nGHz as listed in the FIRST catalog to calculate the specific\nluminosity emitted at 1.4 GHz, L1.4 GHz , via the relation\nfint \u00d7 10\u221226\n\u22121\n4\u03c0D2L erg s\u22121 Hz ,\n(1)\n(1 + z)1\u2212\u03b1\nwhere fint is the integrated flux density in mJy, \u03b1 is the spectral index (i.e., f (\u03bd) \u221d \u03bd \u2212\u03b1 ), and DL is the luminosity distance in cm as calculated from the redshift setting \u03a9m = 0.3,\n\u03a9\u039b = 0.7 and h = 0.7. We assume \u03b1 = 0.7, which is intermediate of the typical range for radio jets (Bridle & Perley\nL1.4GHz =\n\n3. RESULTS\n\nas a function of radio luminosity, where NRADIO is the total number of RQs detected in SDSS and NBAL,RADIO is the\nnumber of RQs which are also classified as BALQSOs. For\nthis plot we only used the \"complete\" SDSS optical sample with apparent optical magnitude mi \u2264 19.1. The bins in\nL1.4 GHz were created adaptively starting from low radio luminosities by requiring a statistically significant sub-sample of\n50 quasars in each bin of luminosity. In each bin we used the\nbinomial theorem to estimate fBAL along with its \u00b11\u03c3 confidence levels (e.g., Gehrels et al. 1986).\nThe first important result of our analysis is the high fraction of classical (BI) BALQSOs detected at low radio powers. The BALQSO fraction of 20+7.3\n\u22125.9 % at the faintest radio\npowers of L1.4 GHz . 1033 erg s\u22121 is in strikingly good agreement with the 20% classical BALQSO occurrence inferred\nby DSS in the 2MASS-SDSS sample (shown with horizontal, thin-dotted line in Figures 1 and 3). This result further\nsupports and extends the key result discussed in DSS that the\ndetected BALQSO fraction should be closer to the intrinsic\none at longer wavelengths, which are gradually less affected\nby absorption troughs and dust extinction.\nThe second striking result of our study is that fBAL drops\nrapidly with increasing radio power to 8.0+5.9\n\u22123.8 % at L1.4 GHz &\n\n\f3\n2 \u00d7 1033 erg s\u22121 . This behavior strongly supports some close\nconnection between radio and BALQSO phenomena and, as\ndiscussed below, poses serious challenges to simple evolutionary models.\nThe open symbols with dashed crosses represent the fraction fBAL obtained including all AI-selected BALQSOs. As\nexpected, we get a much larger fraction of BALQSOs within\nour sample of 44+8.1\n\u22127.8 %, in very good agreement with the findings by DSS who found a fraction of 43% AI BALQSOs in\n2MASS (thick-dotted line). Even in this case, fBAL presents\na very similar behavior as a function of radio luminosity and\nthat we will discuss in \u00a7 3.2.\n3.2. Robustness of Results\nOur results are derived by cross-correlating optical quasars,\nRQs, and BALQSOs. Therefore it is natural to expect that\nseveral issues may affect our conclusions. In this section we\ncarefully analyze the most significant sources of bias which\ncan enter our computations and find that none of these seems\nto be responsible for the observed fBAL \u2212 L1.4 GHz behavior.\nWe first tested for biases from redshift or luminosity selection effects. When repeating our analysis using only the\nsources in two redshift bins 1.7 . z . 2.5 and, separately,\n2.5 . z . 4.38, we find very similar trends for the fBAL L1.4 GHz relation.\nThe completeness of the Schneider et al. (2005) quasar\nsample has been studied in detail by Vanden Berk et al.\n(2005), who estimate a total completeness of 89.3% down\nto mi = 19.1. We do not expect the behavior of fBAL to be\nseverely influenced by these mild incompleteness effects. As\nextensively discussed (e.g., Cirasuolo et al. 2003; Shankar et\nal. 2008b, and references therein), the radio and optical luminosities are correlated with a large observed scatter. Therefore, incompleteness effects in the optical sample will, on average, induce similar effects in the numerator and denominator of equation (2), given the extended distribution of optical\nsources at fixed radio luminosity. As an example of the effect\nof different optical luminosity thresholds on the fraction of\nBALQSOs, we show the resulting fBAL with no optical magnitude cut in the right panel of Figure 1. This highly incomplete sample in the optical still shows the exact same drop of\nat least a factor of \u223c 4 in fBAL .\nOn the other hand, our sample may suffer from selection effects in FIRST. At 3 mJy the completeness of FIRST is about\n93%, decreasing to 75% at 1.5 mJy, and 55% at 1.1 mJy (see\nFigure 1 in Jiang et al. 2007). To check whether our results\nwere affected by this incompleteness, in Figure 2 we compare\nthe results shown in the left panel of Figure 1 obtained from\nthe full sample (solid crosses), with the sample defined by\nonly those radio sources with fint > 3 mJy (dashed crosses).\nThis cut in radio flux density ensures the best completeness\nas possible from FIRST. It is evident that the strong observed\ndrop in fBAL remains unchanged.\nAs anticipated in \u00a7 2, the 2\u2032\u2032 cross-correlation sample ensures a secure identification of the core radio power associated to an optical quasar. However, to check for any bias\nin our results due to incomplete radio identifications in the\nSDSS DR3 quasar catalog, we recomputed fBAL using the full\nsample built by matching SDSS and FIRST. The left panel\nof Figure 3 shows the fraction of BALQSOs with the radio\ncounterpart defined by the nearest source in FIRST within\n5\u2032\u2032 . The right panel of Figure 3 shows instead the fraction of\nBALQSOs with at least one radio counterpart within 30\u2032\u2032 of\nthe optical source. In both cases we still find fBAL to drop\n\nwith increasing radio power. These results are actually expected, as a closer inspection revealed that the overall sample\nof radio-optical sources increases by just \u223c 4% when including sources within 5\u2032\u2032 , out of which only 3 extra BALQSOs\nare found with respect to our reference sample. The increase\nis even milder (\u223c 3%) when the 30\u2032\u2032 sources are included, with\nonly 2 extra BALQSOs included in the sample. The paucity\nof extended radio sources in our sample is in agreement with\nGregg et al. (2006) who found only six quasars from the DR3\nand FIRST Bright Quasar Survey that exhibit Fanaroff-Riley\nII-type (FRII) morphologies and BAL properties, with a BI\nindex strongly decreasing with increasing radio loudness.\nIn Figure 4 we show fBAL as a function of absolute optical\nmagnitude. We do not find significant evidence for any sharp\ntrend of fBAL as a function of Mi , confirming the results by\nDSS for the 2MASS sample. This implies that different optical magnitude cuts do not affect fBAL on one hand, and, on\nthe other, implies that the drop in fBAL is mainly a \"radio phenomenon\", not linked with the quasar bolometric luminosity.\nNote that we did not apply any correction in Figure 4 for extinction as was done in DSS, therefore the resulting fractions\nin the optical are lower than the intrinsic ones (see DSS for\ndetails).\nThe AI sample by Trump et al. (2006) may suffer from a\nsignificant contamination of false positives, which the close\ninspection by Ganguly et al. (2007) found to be about 30%\n(see also Knigge et al. 2008). To investigate the impact these\nfindings may have on our results we have compared the sample of sources cataloged as BALQSOs using the AI definition, with the sample of BALQSO defined using the classical BI index. The distribution of AI-BALQSOs with radio\ncounterparts as a function of the AI index (open histogram) is\ncompared in the upper left panel of Figure 5 with the distribution of the sources which are also identified as BI-BALQSOs\n(filled histogram). We find the latter sample strongly peaked\nat higher AI values, while just the opposite is true for most\nof the AI-BALQSOs. These findings are fully consistent with\nthe recent results by Knigge et al. (2008) who claim for a well\ndistinct separation for the two BALQSO samples. The upper\nright panel of Figure 5 plots the fraction of AI- but not BIidentified BALQSOs as a function of radio power: the drop in\nfBAL with increasing radio power is much less evident for this\nsubclass of sources compared to BI-BALQSOs. These results\nsuggest that AI-BALQSOs are a different class of quasars\nwith respect to the BI-BALQSOs. In the lower right panel\nof Figure 5 the dashed, dotted and solid lines show the fractions of AI-BALQSOs, AI- but not BI-BALQSOs, and BIBALQSOs, respectively. This plot confirms that the apparent\ndrop in the AI-BALQSOs with radio power is driven by the\nbehavior in BI-BALQSOs. The lower right panel of Figure 5\nshows the cumulative distributions for the different subclasses\nof BAL and non-BALQSOs, as labeled. We find that the probability that AI but not BI selected BALQSOs are drawn from\nthe same distribution as non-BALQSOs is P = 0.26, while the\nprobability for being drawn from any other distribution drops\nby several orders of magnitude.\nIn Figure 6 we show the distributions of all non-BALQSOs\n(dashed lines), BI-BALQSOs (solid lines), and AI- but not BIBALQSOs (dotted lines) as a function of radio luminosity for\ndifferent bins of absolute optical magnitude, as labeled. These\nbins were chosen to provide an equal number of BALQSOs\nin each panel. It is apparent that compared to BI-BALQSOs,\nboth the AI- but not BI-BALQSOs and the non-BALQSO distributions have a greater tendency to populate significantly\n\n\f4\nhigher, potentially beamed, radio luminosity bins. This provides further evidence that the trends in fBAL are not a mere\nconsequence of random effects in the radio power distributions of optical quasars. The dashed, dotted, and solid lines\nin Figure 7 show, respectively, the histograms of the distributions of BI-BALQSOs, AI- but not BI- BALQSOs, and nonBALQSOs as a function of color defined as the difference\nbetween absolute i-band and AB radio magnitudes listed in\nSchneider et al. (2005). This plot shows that on average AIbut not BI- BALQSOs, and non-BALQSOs have very similar\noptical-to-radio distributions while BI-BALQSOs are clearly\noffset populating lower radio luminosity bins at fixed optical\nmagnitude.\nOverall our results show that the classical BALQSO fraction in the radio is as high as inferred from the near-IR and\nrapidly drops from \u223c 20% to . 4% with increasing radio\npower. This clear trend confirms previous claims by Becker\net al. (2001), taking advantage of a sample of \u223c 3 higher.\nWe conclude that the behavior of fBAL as a function of radio power seems to be an intrinsic, real feature of the radio,\nBI-BALQSO population, not linked to any significant selection effect. In the following, if not alternatively specified, we\nwill always refer to BALQSOs as those defined through the\nclassical BI definition.\n4. EXPLAINING THE OBSERVED TREND\n\nModels aimed at explaining the BALQSO and/or radio fractions, can be broadly divided into two classes: one in which\neach quasar phase is distinct and characterized by the internal physical evolution undergone by the system, and the other\nin which all these phenomena co-exist at all times but different source orientations modify the observed balance of one\nprocess with respect to another.\n4.1. The Evolutionary Model\nThe results discussed in \u00a7 3 seem to pose a serious challenge to \"evolutionary\" models for BALQSOs. The simple\nsketch shown in the left panel of Figure 8, represents the basic picture for the evolution of a black hole within its host\ngalaxy (e.g., Kawakatu et al. 2003). The mass of the central\nblack hole, shown as a solid line in the left panel of Figure 8,\nexponentially grows through gas accretion from the surrounding medium. Initially the whole galaxy, or at least its central\nregion, is buried under optically-thick layers of dust which\nallow the AGN to be detectable only in those bands that suffer less from obscuration, such as in X-rays (e.g., Ueda et al.\n2003). When the black hole becomes sufficiently luminous,\nit injects enough energy and momentum (e.g., Fabian 1999)\ninto the surrounding medium to disperse the obscuring material. During this blowout phase, the system will be detected as\na BALQSO featuring the signatures of strong winds in their\nspectra, while at later stages it will be observed as an optical,\ndust-free quasar.\nIt is still unclear what triggers the radio activity of an AGN\n(e.g., Sikora et al. 2007), so it is difficult to predict when\nan optical quasar should become radio-loud (e.g., Blundell &\nKuncic 2007; Shankar et al. 2008b). Nevertheless, in pure\nevolutionary models the radio phase is usually viewed as a\nbrief period within the optical phase as the incidence of RQs\nin optical samples is rather small, (\u223c 15 \u2212 20%, e.g., Jiang et\nal. 2007; see also \u00a7 1). In this model, our results on fBAL\nindicate that the radio duty cycle must overlap the boundary\nbetween the BALQSO and optical phases, because a signifi-\n\ncant fraction of optical quasars also emit in radio but are not\nBALQSOs, and vice versa.\nIn a pure evolutionary model our result that fBAL \u223c 20%\nconstrains the BALQSO and non-BALQSO phases to last for\n\u223c 20% and 80%, respectively, within the brief radio phase,\nwhich is about 15\u201320% of the total optical quasar lifetime (see\nleft panel of Figure 8). The consistency between the optical\nand radio BALQSO fractions imposes a coincidence problem,\nwhich could be otherwise naturally interpreted in orientation\nmodels (\u00a7 4.2). Additionally, the drop in fBAL at high radio\npowers is difficult to reproduce simply in pure evolutionary\nmodels, and thus such models would need to be fine-tuned to\nexplain the drop. One simple explanation for such a trend may\nbe an increasing feedback efficiency with quasar luminosity\n(e.g., Kelly et al. 2008). The more luminous sources would\nthen be faster in removing the surrounding obscuring medium,\nshortening the BALQSO phase and consequently inducing a\ndecrease in fBAL . However, this model is at variance with the\nresults in Figure 4 and by DSS which show that the BALQSO\nfraction is constant with optical luminosity.\nGregg et al. (2006) found an absence of BALQSO FRII\nsources and a drop in the BI index with increasing radio loudness of the sources. They interpreted their results within an\nevolutionary scheme where a BALQSO occurs in the early\nstage of a quasar during its emergence from a thick shroud of\nsurrounding dust (see left panel of Figure 8). In this model\nFRIIs are only seen after most of the obscuring shroud has\nbeen removed. Following Gregg et al. (2006) we further\nprobe the constraints for evolutionary models by addressing the coexistence of FRII/BAL sources within our sample.\nIn Figure 9 the open triangles show the fraction of FRIIselected sources2 within the whole radio sample, while the\nfilled circles refer to the fraction of FRII sources within the\nBI-selected radio sample. Both samples have been divided\ninto two subgroups with radio luminosities below and above\nL1.4GHz = 2 \u00d7 1033 erg s\u22121 Hz\u22121 . Note that the contamination\nfrom random interloping radio sources in the identification\nof FRII sources is small. The average number of interlopers\nwithin 30\u2032\u2032 of any position is only 0.02 (Becker et al. 1995),\ni.e., a cumulative number of just about 3 sources are expected\nto be misidentified as FRIIs. It can be seen that in both BI\nand not BI-selected samples, the fraction of FRII increases\nwith radio power, mirroring the fact that FRIIs are intrinsically more luminous radio sources (e.g., De Zotti et al. 2005).\nWe do find some evidence for FRIIs to be less associated to\nBALQSOs within the BI-selected sources than in the overall\nsample at fixed radio power, although the difference is only\nmarginally significant. Gregg et al. (2006) claim a drop by a\nabout an order of magnitude in the fraction of FRIIs in BALradio samples, while we find a mean drop of \u223c 2.4. Also, we\ndo not find strong evidence for the Gregg et al. (2006) anticorrelation between BI index and radio loudness. A Pearson's\nr-test yields a correlation parameter of r = \u22120.36, with a significance of P = 0.55; however, the small number of FRII\nBALQSOs limits this analysis. The BI index of FRIIs in our\nBAL-radio sample does not show any clear trend with radio\npower, as shown with filled circles in the right panel of Figure 9. For comparison, in the same Figure we also show with\nopen symbols the mean BIs for the low and high radio power\nsubsamples of non-FRIIs, which show a rather flat behavior\nwith increasing radio power, in agreement with the overall\n2 Here we simply call \"FRIIs\" all those sources in the sample with multiple\nradio components within 30\u2032\u2032 .\n\n\f5\nsample (see \u00a7 4.3 and Figure 11).\nIt also may well be true that the BALQSOs we are referring\nto here are only a partial representation of the \"outflowing\"\nAGNs. Many more systems may be detected during initial\nand final phases of the blowout and therefore may be characterized by lower velocities. Ganguly & Brotherton (2008)\nhave shown that including Narrow (. 800 km s\u22121 ) and Associated absorption systems, the latter being characterized by\nnarrow absorption-lines near the redshift of the quasar, the\nfraction of outflowing AGNs rises to about 60%, independent\nof optical luminosity. The fBAL radio dependence for the cumulative sample may then be different then what is inferred\nhere. Several works have shown that a significant fraction of\nRQs show associated absorption and high radio power sources\nmay preferentially exhibit narrower absorption features (e.g.,\nWeymann et al. 1979; Anderson et al. 1987; Ganguly et al.\n2001; Vestergaard 2003). Such a hypothesis needs to be tested\nwith samples with identified Associated Absorption systems,\nsuch as those by Ganguly et al. (2007). Nevertheless, the drop\nin fBAL for BI-BALQSOs will still need to be explained.\n4.2. The Orientation-Beaming Model\nIn this section we show that a simple orientation effect can\nfully explain the puzzling trend in the fBAL -L1.4 GHz distribution, although even this model is not entirely satisfactory, as\ndiscussed at the end of the section. This model assumes that\nsome fraction of RQs are relativistically beamed towards the\nobserver and are boosted to higher radio luminosities. Since\nthe radio luminosity function is steep, beamed radio sources\nare a disproportionate fraction of the bright sources. According to popular disk wind models (e.g., Murray et al. 1995,\nProga et al. 2000), radio BALQSOs are instead on average\nnon-beamed sources, being preferentially viewed close to the\nplane of the accretion disk surrounding the central black hole.\nIt is then reasonable to expect that if BALQSOs are a fixed\nfraction of the intrinsic radio luminosity function, then the\nobserved occurrence of BALQSOs must decrease at high radio powers due to the apparent increase of NRADIO in Eq. (2)\ntowards high luminosities due to beaming.\nWe quantitatively explore this basic idea by building a simple \"unification\" model (e.g., Urry & Padovani 1995). The\nintrinsic radio quasar luminosity function was assumed to be\nwith arbitrary normalization and\na power-law \u03a6(LR ) \u221d L\u2212\u03b2\nR\nslope \u03b2 = \u22123.0, which is consistent with the bright-end slopes\nmeasured for the optical and radio quasar luminosity functions (e.g., De Zotti et al. 2005, Richards et al. 2006, Jiang\net al. 2006)3. We then assume that the population of radio\nquasars is composed of three sub-populations, as sketched\nin the right panel of Figure 8. The first one is represented\nby radio BALQSOs, which are preferentially viewed at lines\nof sight close to the disk or the torus, at a maximum angle\nof \u03b8 . 11.5\u25e6 , corresponding to a fraction of sin(\u03b8) = 20%,\nas inferred in \u00a7 3 and by DSS. Following Urry & Padovani\n(1995) we then assumed that the fraction of beamed sources\nis viewed at an angle of 38\u25e6 from the jet axis, corresponding\nto a fraction of \u223c 21%. The last sub-group is composed of\nradio non-beamed sources viewed at intermediate angles accounting for the remaining \u223c 59% of the total. AI-BALQSOs\nin this model must be randomly distributed at all angles to\nensure their fraction to be flat with radio power. The relative\n3 The exact value of this slope does not affect our results as the uncertainties in this parameter are degenerate with the uncertainties in other model\nparameters\n\ncontributions of the different type of sources to the total radio\nluminosity function are shown in the left panel of Figure 10,\nplotted as L3 \u03a6(L) which flattens out the luminosity function\nand enhances the difference among the lines.\nThe luminosity function of beamed sources was computed\nfollowing the method outlined in Urry & Padovani (1991).\nThe observed luminosity function at a given observed luminosity Lobs was obtained by convolving the intrinsic luminosity function with the probability P(Lobs |Lint ). Following Urry\n& Padovani (1991) we allowed beamed sources to also have\na diffuse component from the lobes and the core, in addition\nto the beamed emission. Therefore the observed luminosity\nof this sub-group was parameterized as Lobs = (1 + f \u03b4 p )Lint ,\nwhere Lint is the intrinsic luminosity, f is the fraction of luminosity in the jets, \u03b4 = [\u03b3(1 \u2212 \u03b2 cos\u03b8)]\u22121 is the Doppler\nfactor corresponding to a given angle \u03b8 and Lorentz factor\n\u03b3 = (1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 )\u22121/2 , and the exponent p is a parameter depending on the spectrum and reacceleration of the radiating particles. Given the relatively high number of parameters in this\nmodel, we adopt p = 3, \u03b3 = 11, f = 0.005 and the maximum\nbeaming angle to \u03b8max = 38\u25e6 . These are the same values used\nby Urry & Padovani (1995) and, more recently, by Padovani\net al. (2007) to reproduce within unification models the luminosity distributions of samples dominated by beamed sources.\nThe apparent luminosity function of beamed radio sources,\n\"crosses\" the intrinsic luminosity function at a luminosity\nwhich depends on the minimum luminosity in which we\nallow beamed sources to appear in the luminosity function (see Figure 10). We parameterized this luminosity as\nlog L1.4 GHz ,MIN = 32 \u2212 \u2206 logL1.4 GHz , where log L1.4 GHz \u223c 32\nis the minimum luminosity in the sample. The solid line in\nthe right panel of Figure 10 shows our best-fit model for the\nexpected fraction of BALQSOs as a function of radio luminosity. Optimizing the model to the L1.4 GHz -dependence of\n2\nfBAL , we find \u2206 log L1.4 GHz = 0.09+0.02\n\u22120.01 , with \u03c7min \u223c 12.3,\nfor 12 degrees of freedom. This model implies that beamed\nsources are almost absent in the luminosity function below\nL1.4 GHz \u223c 1032 erg s\u22121 and then start to become important only\nabove this luminosity threshold. To better compare with the\ndata, we also show with open circles the expected fraction for\nthis model integrated over the same radio luminosity bins of\nthe data.\nIn this model the dependence of the BALQSO fraction on\nradio luminosity is entirely due to geometry and it is independent of the duty cycle of RQs within the overall quasar\npopulation. Nevertheless, the origin of the radio emission can\nstill be an evolutionary phase or related to specific properties\nof quasars such as the magnetic field, the black hole mass,\nspin or Eddington ratio.\nA pure geometrical model, although plausible on statistical\ngrounds, is not entirely satisfactory. Polar BI-BALQSO outflows have indeed been observed in several cases (e.g., Zhou\net al. 2006; Ghosh & Punsly 2007; Wang et al. 2008), and the\npaucity of FRIIs within BALQSOs can hardly be accounted\nfor in simple orientation models (see \u00a7 4.1). Nevertheless,\nwe expect that some non-orientation processes may effect the\nphysics of radio and BALQSOs and induce different evolutionary trends in different type of sources. For example, it\nhas been observed that AGNs have broad Eddington ratio distributions at fixed black hole mass (e.g., Shen et al. 2008).\nThe more luminous FRII sources may be driven by higher Eddington ratios than FRI sources, at fixed BH mass, and consequently may have higher kinetic powers and stronger radia-\n\n\f6\ntion pressures. These may be more efficient in removing BAL\nclouds along the line of sight and also be more efficient in\ndriving collimated jets, thus explaining both the reduced BAL\nfraction and the large scale hot-spots observed at kpc scales\n(as also partly discussed by Gregg et al. 2006).\n4.3. The Energy Exchange Model\nAnother possible explanation for the drop in fBAL , could\nrely on some sort of \"energy exchange\" from the wind to the\njet in high luminosity radio sources. Within the framework of\nthe geometrical model, the energy gained by the system from\nthe external gas accretion must be redistributed between the\njet and the wind by some physical mechanism, such as the\nmagnetic field. We could then expect that those quasars with\nhigh radio powers preferentially inject energy into the jet due\nto a stronger intrinsic magnetic field and/or a rapidly spinning\ncentral black hole, thus limiting the energy channeled into the\nwind and inevitably causing a drop in fBAL .\nWe tested this idea by considering in the left panel of Figure 11 the BALQSO BI index (upper panel), AI index (middle\npanel) and maximum velocity Vmax (lower panel) measured\nfrom the absorption troughs as proxy of the wind power, and\nstudied their behavior as a function of radio luminosity. In\neach bin, the quantities were computed from the biweightmean (Hoaglin et al. 1983) and the errors\u221a\non this mean were\nestimated from the biweight-\u03c3 reduced by N, where N is the\nnumber of BALQSOs in the bin. Becker et al. (2000, 2001)\nfound the mean BI decreases with radio luminosity for the\nhigh-ionization BALQSOs (HIBALQSOs), an effect which\ncould be simply interpreted as a decrease in the amount of\nobscuring mass for the more luminous sources. They also\nfound tentative evidence for HIBALQSOs to have their maximum velocity decreasing with radio power. In our larger sample, which should be dominated by HIBALQSOs, we instead\nfind the AI, BI and maximum wind velocity show no clear\nevidence for a decrease at high radio powers although with\na large scatter, in conflict with the energy exchange model.\nWe also find marginal evidence for a drop in the AI index but\nnot in the Vmax of the AI but not BI-defined BALQSOs (right\npanel of Figure 11).\nThe energy exchange model may also conflict with evidence that AGNs have similar radiative and kinetic efficiencies (e.g., Shankar et al. 2008a,b). Moreover, if the efficiency\nis constant, then Vmax should increase with luminosity (i.e.,\nwith the mean accretion rate), rendering the result on its flatness rather intriguing (e.g., Ganguly et al. 2007).\n5. DISCUSSIONS\n\nSynchrotron self-absorption may impose an uncertainty in\nestimating the radio flux density. The spectral analysis by\nBecker et al. (2000) found that about one third of the sources\ncould show synchrotron self-absorption at lower frequencies, typical of compact radio sources. If so, up to 30%\nof the radio luminosities of BALQSOs may be underestimated and in turn significantly affect our results. To quantify the implications of self-absorption, one could assume\nthe intrinsic fraction of BALQSOs to be fBAL = k, with k\nconstant with increasing radio luminosity. If self-absorption\nmainly affects sources above an intrinsic radio luminosity\nof Lbreak = L1.4 GHz \u223c 2 \u00d7 1033 erg s\u22121 , as suggested by the\nobserved behavior in fBAL , then the observed fraction of\nBALQSOs, fBAL obs , will be \"distorted\" by the fact that a\nfraction of \u223c 30% of luminous radio sources will be trans-\n\nferred from high to low luminosities, decreasing the number of BALQSOs at high radio powers and proportionally\nincreasing it at low radio powers. For example, by setting\nk = 0.15, the fraction of BALQSOs with L1.4 GHz & Lbreak will\nbe fBAL obs = [k \u00d7 (1 \u2212 0.3)]/[k \u00d7 (1 \u2212 0.3) + (1 \u2212 k)] \u223c 0.1,\nwhile the fraction of sources with L1.4 GHz . Lbreak will be\nfBAL obs = [k \u00d7 (1 + 0.3)]/[k \u00d7 (1 + 0.3) + (1 \u2212 k)] \u223c 0.19,\nwhich is only in marginal agreement with observations. This\nsimple explanation therefore cannot fully account for the\nsteep drop in fBAL obs . To be relevant in our study, synchrotron\nself-absorption should also be able to decrease the intrinsic\nradio power by factors of 10 to 1000, however typical reductions of only a factor of \u223c 10 are expected (e.g., Snellen &\nSchilizzi 1999).\n6. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe find that the fraction of classical BALQSOs among\nthe FIRST radio sources in the SDSS DR3 catalogue, is\n20.5+7.3\n\u22125.9 % at the faintest radio powers detected (L1.4GHz \u223c\n1032 erg s\u22121 ), and rapidly drops to . 8% at L1.4 GHz \u223c 3 \u00d7\n1033 erg s\u22121 . Similarly, adopting the broader AI definition of\nTrump et al. (2006) we find the fraction of radio BALQSOs\n+7.3\nto be 44+8.1\n\u22127.8 % reducing to 23.1\u22126.1 at high luminosities.\nThe detected fraction at low radio luminosities is consistent\nwith the recent estimates inferred in infrared bands by DSS,\nsupporting the fact that longer, less absorbed wavelengths, are\nmore suitable for probing the intrinsic fraction of BALQSOs.\nWe therefore agree with Hewett and Foltz (2003) who claimed\na similar occurrence of BALQSOs in optical and radio samples. The variation of the BALQSO fraction with radio power\nis also similar to that found by Becker et al. (2000, 2001) and\nHewett and Foltz (2003), although our results are supported\nby a much larger sample. The decrease in the number of radio BALQSOs is real, in the sense that it is not dependent on\nredshift or luminosity cuts, biased by optical or radio selection effects, or dependent on the specific type of radio source\nconsidered (core-dominated or extended with multiple components). We also find that at fixed optical magnitude, the\nhighest bins of radio luminosity are preferentially populated\nby non-BALQSOs, consistent with the overall trend.\nHowever, we find that those quasars identified as AIBALQSOs but not under the classical BI definition, do not\nshow the same significant drop in the fraction as a function\nof radio power and share similar cumulative radio distributions as non-BALQSOs. This further supports independent\nclaims for which these sources characterized by lower equivalent width, may represent an independent class with respect\nto the classical BALQSOs. We find the BI, AI and mean maximum wind velocity to be roughly constant at all radio powers.\nWe discuss several plausible physical models which may\nexplain the observed fast drop in the fraction of the classical BALQSOs with increasing radio power, although no\none model is entirely satisfactory. A strictly evolutionary\nmodel for the BALQSO and radio emission phases requires\na strong fine-tuning to work, while a simple geometric model\nwhere the apparent radio luminosity function is partly due to\nbeamed, non-BALQSOs, although more promising in matching the data, cannot explain strong polar BALQSOs and the\npaucity of FRII sources within BALQSOs. Of course, the\ndrop in fBAL could also be viewed as an increase of the\nBALQSO fraction towards low-intermediate radio sources\nwhich may be more likely to show BALQSO features. This\nmodel however does not explain why the fraction of BALQ-\n\n\f7\nSOs at low radio powers is identical to the one obtained in the\noptical-NIR.\nWe thank the anonymous referee for suggestions which improved the paper. We also thank Chris Kochanek for helpful\n\ncomments that improved the presentation of this work, and\nMichael S. Brotherton and Rajib Ganguly for several useful\ncomments and suggestions. We finally acknowledge discussion at the AGN lunch in the OSU astronomy department.\n\nREFERENCES\nAnderson, S. F., Weymann, R. J., Foltz, C. B., & Chaffee, F. H. 1987, AJ, 94,\n278\nBecker, R.

(2007), respectively. Right panel: fraction of BALQSOs\nwithin the full SDSS sample of RQs; here all lines and symbols are as in the left panel; the statistical significance of the drop in the radio-BALQSOs fraction\ntowards high radio powers does not depend on the optical magnitude limit.\n\n\f8\n\nF IG . 2.- Dependence of fBAL on radio luminosity for samples defined to have different flux density limits fint in FIRST and corresponding different\ncompleteness levels. The drop in fBAL is always present.\n\nF IG . 3.- Left panel: fraction as a function of radio power of radio-BALQSOs with an optical magnitude brighter than mi = 19.1 with a single radio spot\nwithin 5\u2032\u2032 of the optical source; if multiple radio components are contained within this aperture, then only the closest source is considered. Right panel: fraction\nof radio-BALQSOs for sources which lie within 30\u2032\u2032 of the optical source; if multiple radio components are present within this aperture, then they are treated as\na single source with radio power given by the sum of the integrated flux densities of each component. In both panels all symbols and lines have same meaning as\nin Figure 1.\n\n\f9\n\nF IG . 4.- Fraction of radio-BALQSOs as a function of AB optical magnitude. fBAL is about constant if not increasing at higher optical luminosities, which does\nnot supports any direct obvious link in the drop of fBAL with increasing radio power. Note that the true fractions in the optical should be higher once corrected\nfor absorption and extinction (Dai et al. 2008).\n\n\f10\n\nF IG . 5.- Upper left panel: histogram of all BALQSOs defined with the AI definition; the striped histogram refers to the fraction of the sources which are\nidentified as BALQSOs also under the BI definition. Upper right panel: fraction of sources defined as BALQSOs with the AI definition but not with the BI one as\na function of radio power; the drop in fBAL with increasing radio power is much less evident for this subclass of sources. Lower left panel: the dashed, dotted and\nsolid lines show the fractions of radio-BALQSOs defined with the AI definition only, with AI but not BI, and with the BI definition, respectively, as a function of\nradio power. Lower right panel: cumulative distributions for the different subclasses of BAL and non-BALQSOs, as labeled, as a function of radio power. The\nprobability that AI but not BI selected BALQSOs are drawn from the same distribution as non-BALQSOs is P = 0.26.\n\nF IG . 6.- The dashed, dotted, and solid lines show, respectively, the histograms of the distributions of BI-BALQSOs, AI but not BI BALQSOs, and nonBALQSOs as a function of radio luminosity in different bins of optical luminosity, as labeled. Unlike the BI BALQSOs, the non-BI BALQSOs have a greater\ntendency to form a prolonged tail of very luminous, potentially beamed, radio sources.\n\n\f11\n\nF IG . 7.- The dashed, dotted, and solid lines show, respectively, the cumulative histograms of the distributions of BI-BALQSOs, AI but not BI BALQSOs,\nand non-BALQSOs as a function of color. This plot shows that on average at fixed optical luminosity the non-BI BALQSOs have a tendency to be more radio\nluminous than BI BALQSOs.\n\nF IG . 8.- Left panel: schematic diagram of a pure \"evolutionary\" model. The mass of the central black hole starts growing in a heavily obscured phase. When\nit becomes sufficiently luminous to blow away the surrounding medium, it can then be detected as a BALQSO and then finally as an optical, dust-free quasar.\nRight panel: schematic representation of a simple \"orientation\" model for RQs and BALQSOs. The radio phase in both schemes is always considered as a brief\nperiod within the optical phase.\n\nF IG . 9.- Left panel: fraction of FRII-selected sources among the BI-selected BALQSOs (filled circles) and non-BALQSOs (open triangles); both samples have\nbeen divided into two subgroups with radio luminosities below and above L1.4GHz = 2 \u00d7 1033 erg s\u22121 Hz\u22121 ; we display the median luminosity of each subsample.\nRight panel: absorption index for non-FRII radio sources (open circles) and radio-BI selected FRII sources (filled circles) as a function of radio power. For the\nmore numerous non-FRIIs, we display the mean BI values and associated uncertainties following Hoaglin et al. (1983; see \u00a7 4.3).\n\n\f12\n\nF IG . 10.- Left panel: radio quasar luminosity functions plotted in units of L3 \u03a6(L) to enhance the differences between the lines; the long-dashed line is\nthe luminosity function of RQs detected as BI BALQSOs, normalized to be 20% the one of the intrinsic total radio quasar luminosity function, which we have\nassumed to have a slope of \u22123.0; the dotted line is the fraction of \u223c 59% of radio non-beamed, non-BI BALQSOs, while the dot-dashed line is the fraction\nof \u223c 21% of beamed sources (see text for details); the solid line is the total apparent luminosity function. Right panel: the solid line is the expected fraction\nof BALQSOs as a function of radio luminosity derived as the ratio of the dashed and solid lines in the left panel; the open circles show the expected fraction\naveraged over the same radio luminosity bin as the data; all other symbols and lines are as in the left panel of Figure 1.\n\nF IG . 11.- Left panel: the crosses in the upper panel show the mean BALQSO Balnicity Index per bin of radio luminosity, while the full sample is shown with\npoints; the middle panel shows the same for the Absorption Index, while the lower panel shows the maximum velocity measured from the absorption troughs as\na function of radio luminosity. Right panel: Absorption Index (upper panel) and maximum velocity (lower panel) for AI but not BI-selected BALSQSOs. We do\nnot find any significant trend with radio luminosity for all plotted quantities.\n\n\f"}
