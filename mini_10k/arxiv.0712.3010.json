The X-ray yields and kinetic\nenergy distributions are compared with the experimental data.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe exotic hydrogen-like atoms are formed in highly excited states, when a heavy negative\nparticle (\u03bc\u2212 , \u03c0 \u2212 , K\u2212 , etc.) slows down and captures in hydrogen media due to inelastic\ncollisions. The formation is followed by the atomic cascade in which the initial distributions\nin the quantum numbers (n, l) and kinetic energy of the exotic atom change due to various\nprocesses: radiative transitions, external Auger effect, elastic scattering, Stark transitions,\nCoulomb de-excitation, weak decay and nuclear absorption (in case of hadronic atoms). A\ngood understanding of the kinetics of atomic cascade in hydrogen-like exotic atoms is very\nimportant both for the planning and interpretation of the experiments (see for a review\n[1]). The first theoretical study of the atomic cascade was performed more than forty five\nyears ago by Leon and Bethe [2]. In this paper, and later in more refined models [3, 4],\nthe rates of the collisional processes were calculated in the semiclassical approximation at\na fixed kinetic energy (\u223c 1 eV) and used for the simulation of the atomic cascade. A\nnumber of experiments in which the energy distributions of \u03bc\u2212 p, \u03bc\u2212 d and \u03c0 \u2212 p atoms were\nmeasured using various time-of-flight methods [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] showed that the kinetic energy\nchanges during the cascade. In particular, the existence of high energy components has been\nestablished in pionic hydrogen in the neutron time-of-flight experiment [7] and in muonic\nhydrogen in diffusion experiments [8, 9]. This experiments require a more sophisticated\napproach taking the evolution of the kinetic energy distribution into account during the\nwhole atomic cascade. Beginning with Markushin [10] recent cascade models take into\naccount the acceleration and deceleration processes. The extended standard cascade model\n(ESCM) [11] introduces a number of improvements compared to the earlier models: for\nexample, the scattering from molecular hydrogen at high n is calculated as opposed to the\nphenomenological treatment in other cascade models.\nIn the recent papers [12, 13], the dynamics of the collisions of the excited exotic atoms\nwith hydrogen ones has been studied in the framework of the close-coupling approach. The\nelastic scattering, Stark transitions and Coulomb de-excitation were described by a unified\nmanner in this approach. The differential and integral cross-sections were calculated in a\n1\n\n\fwide range of the principle quantum number values and relative energies for muonic, pionic\nand antiprotonic hydrogen atoms. The vacuum polarization and strong interaction shifts\n(for hadronic atoms) were taken into account (see also this issue).\nIn the present paper the first theoretical results of the X-ray yields and kinetic energy\ndistributions for \u03bc\u2212 p and \u03c0 \u2212 p atoms calculated in the new version of the ESCM are introduced. The new results for the collisional processes ([12, 13], see also this issue), especially\nfor Coulomb de-excitation process, are used in the present ESCM and lead to an essential\nimprovement over the previous cascade calculations.\n\n2\n\nThe extended standard cascade model\n\nThe cascade in exotic atoms (as in the previous ESCM) is divided into the classical domain\nfor high n and the quantum mechanical domain for low n. In the classical domain (for\nmuonic and pionic hydrogen we use n \u2265 9) the classical-trajectory Monte Carlo calculations\nhave been included in the cascade model (see for details [11]) with the molecular structure\nof the target taken into account for the description of the elastic scattering, Stark mixing\nand Coulomb de-excitation processes. The external Auger effect was calculated in the\nsemiclassical approximation through the whole cascade. In the upper stage of the cascade\nthe distributions in quantum numbers and kinetic energy are calculated. Further, these\ndistributions were used as input data for the next stage of the atomic cascade. In the\nquantum mechanical domain (at n \u2264 8 ) the differential and integral cross sections for all\nnl 7\u2192 n\u2032 l\u2032 transitions (besides the Auger and radiative de-excitations) were calculated in the\nfully quantum mechanical close-coupling approach (see [12, 13] and references therein) for\nthe initial states with n \u2264 8 and relative energies E \u2265 0.01 eV. The corresponding arrays\nof the cross sections are included in the cascade code. Thus the present cascade code does\nnot employ any fitting parameters and the kinetics of the atomic cascade is treated more\naccurately.\nThe initial conditions for the cascade calculations are defined by the initial distributions in\nthe quantum numbers n and l and the laboratory kinetic energy of the exotic atoms. In\nthe simplest picture, the\n\u221a exotic particle is captured by the proton of the hydrogen atom\nin a state with ni \u223c M (M is a reduced mass of exotic atom in atomic units). More\nelaborate approaches [14, 15] take the molecular effects of the target into account and\npredict distribution in the initial ni with the peak shifted towards lower values and nonstatistical li -distribution. In the present cascade calculations the influence of the initial\nparameters are also studied. In order to obtain good statistics the cascade calculations\nwere performed with 106 events.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nResults\nMuonic hydrogen\n\nMuonic hydrogen atom is the simplest of exotic atoms and its experimental and theoretical\nstudies are the best probe for the investigation of the various processes in exotic atom from\nhydrogen atom or molecule collisions. The present cascade calculations in muonic hydrogen have been done in the density range (10\u22127 \u2212 1) (in units of Liquid Hydrogen Density,\n2\n\n\fLHD = 4.25 * 1022 atoms/cm3 ) using various initial conditions. The results are compared\nwith the experimental data [16, 17, 18] for relative K X-ray yields. The energy distributions of muonic hydrogen and Doppler broadening of the X-ray lines are also introduced.\nThe dependence of the calculated absolute K X-ray yields on hydrogen density for the\n\u03bc\u2212 p atom are shown in Figure 1.\n1\n\nTotal\n0.8\n\nK\u03b1\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\nK\u03b2\n0.2\n\nK\u03b5\n0\n1e-07\n\n1e-06\n\n1e-05\n\n0.0001\n\nK\u03b4\n\n0.001\n\nK\u03b3\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\nN/LHD\nFigure 1: The density dependence of the absolute K X-ray yields in muonic hydrogen.\nIn contrast to the practically linear dependence of the absolute Ktot yield on the density\nin the wide range from 10\u22127 LHD to \u223c 10\u22122 LHD the individual Ki yields (i = \u03b1, \u03b2, etc.)\nhave a more complicated density dependence due to the competition between the various\ncollisional and non-collisional processes during the cascade. The atomic cascade at low\ntarget densities is mainly dominated by the radiative de-excitation proceeding through the\ncircular states that result in 2p \u2192 1s transition whereas the transitions np \u2192 1s are much\nweaker. We see the corresponding picture in Figure 1. At very low density the kinetic\nenergy distribution of the muonic atom must conserve it initial kinetic energy distribution.\nWhile the density is increased the role of the collisional processes enhances leading to both\nthe decrease of K\u03b1 yield and simultaneously the increase of the other Ki yields (i 6= \u03b1),\nconserving the total absolute yield practically unchangeable. With increasing density the\nCoulomb de-excitation becomes also more efficient (especially at low energies) and leads\nto the acceleration of the exotic atom and higher populations of the np states with n > 2\ndue to the Stark transitions. At the target densities more than \u223c 10\u22123 \u00f7 10\u22122 LHD the\ncollisional de-excitation n \u2192 n\u2032 (n\u2032 < n) begins to dominate the radiative transitions (external Auger effect and Coulomb transitions) resulting in the decrease of the K\u2265\u03b2 yields.\nSince the collisional de-excitations to the 1s state of the muonic hydrogen are strongly\nsuppressed (more or about 2 keV energy is released) we observe the enhancement of the\nabsolute K\u03b1 yield due to the collisional transitions to 2p state and the Stark 2s \u2192 2p transition at the energy above the threshold. Thus the swift suppression of the absolute K\u03b1\n3\n\n\fyield at the densities from 10\u22127 LHD to \u223c 10\u22123 LHD and increase at more higher densities\ncan be explained by the competition of the different processes during the atomic cascade\nin which the evolution of the kinetic energy is taken into account through the whole cascade.\nThe discussed above regularities in the absolute yields can be justified or vice versa in\ncomparison of the calculated relative X-ray yields for the \u03bc\u2212 p with the experimental data\n[16, 17, 18] introduced in Figure 2.\n0.4\n\n1\n\nAnderhub et al.\nBregant et al.\nLauss et al.\n\nK\u03b1\n0.3\n\n0.8\n\nrelative yields\n\nrelative yields\n\n0.9\n\n0.7\n0.6\n\nAnderhub et al., K\u03b2\nBregant et al., K\u03b2\nLauss et al., K\u03b2\nLauss et al., K\u03b3\n\nK\u03b2\n\n0.2\n\nK\u03b3\nK\u03b4\n\n0.1\n0.5\n0.4 -7\n10\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0 -7\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\nN/LHD\n\nN/LHD\n\nFigure 2: The density dependence of the relative X-ray yields in muonic hydrogen: K\u03b1\non the left; K\u03b2 , K\u03b3 and K\u03b4 yields (black, red and green, respectively) on the right. The\nexperimental data are from [16, 17, 18].\nThe agreement between theoretical results and experimental data is very good practically for all densities under consideration. The observable disagreements can be a subject\nfor further both theoretical and experimental studies. In our opinion, there are also a number of problems which demand more elaborate experimental studies: a proper separation\nof the different k lines, inclusion a Doppler broadening effect in the analysis of the experimental data and so on. It would be very important to check the present results directly by\nmeasuring the absolute X-ray yields at some values of the target density.\nThe kinetic energy distribution of the exotic atom changes during the cascade and is a\nmore refined probe of the theoretical approaches to the description of the cascade processes.\nUsing the cascade model described above we calculated the \u03bc\u2212 p kinetic energy distribution\nat the moment of the K\u03b1 , K\u03b2 , etc. radiative transitions and the corresponding Doppler\nbroadening of the 1s line due to the kinetic energy distribution of the exotic atom at the\ninstant of the np \u2192 1s radiative transitions (n = 2 \u00f7 4) at the target pressure 10 bar\n(\u223c 10\u22122 LHD). The results are shown in Figure 3.\nAs it is seen from Figure 3, the kinetic energy distribution has distinctive high energy\nstructures arising from different Coulomb transitions with \u2206n \u2265 1 preceding the radiative\nde-excitation. The complicated shapes of these structures can be simply explained by the\ninterplay of three factors: the kinetic energy distribution of exotic atom before Coulomb\ntransition, the anisotropy of the angular distribution in the Coulomb de-excitation process and, finally, the deceleration due to the elastic scattering and Stark transitions after\nCoulomb de-excitation but before the radiative de-excitation.\nThe energy distribution at low n can be determined by measuring the Doppler broadening\n4\n\n\f0.03\n\n5\u21922\n\n5\nK\u03b1\nK\u03b2\n\n4\n\n6\u21923\n\n5\u21923\n\nProbability\n\n0.04\n\n4\u21922\n\nK\u03b1\nK\u03b2\nK\u03b3\nK\u03b4\n\n3\u21922\n\n4\u21923\n\n5\u21924\n\n6\u21924\n\n0.05\n\n7\u21926\n6\u21925\n\n0.06\n\nK\u03b3\n\n3\n\n0.02\n2\n\n0.01\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240 260 0\n\nE, eV\n\n-1.2 -1 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2 1.4\n\nE, eV\n\nFigure 3: On the left: the kinetic-energy distribution of \u03bc\u2212 p at the instant of the radiative\nnp \u2192 1s transitions in gaseous hydrogen at pressure 10 bar.

The results of our cascade calculations for the absolute X-ray yields as a function\nof the target density are shown in Figure 5 in comparison with the experimental data [19].\nThe nuclear absorption in the hadronic atoms results to a strong suppression of the KX-ray\nyields, beginning from very low densities. As a whole the calculated yields are in a good\nagreement with the experimental data. In the calculation we introduced the additional\nparameter simulating the induced absorption from np states. The value of this parameter\nused in all present calculations for 2p-state was chosen equal to 0.045 meV.\n1\n\n\u25cf - total\n\u25b2 - K\u03b1\n\u25bc - K\u03b2\n\u25c6 - K\u03b3\nK\u03b4\nK\u03b5\nK\u03b6\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.001 -7\n10\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\nN/LHD\nFigure 5: The density dependence of the absolute X-ray yields in \u03c0 \u2212 p atom. The experimental data are from [19].\nThe kinetic energy distribution of the pionic hydrogen at the moment of nuclear absorption in liquid hydrogen is shown in Figure 6. The experimental data from PSI experiments [7] (Bad. and the present theoretical description are shown on the left side and\nright side of the Figure 7 respectively. The most promising features are that for the first\ntime we can explain in more details both the whole kinetic energy distribution of the \u03c0 \u2212 p\natoms at the instant of charge-exchange reaction and fine structure of this distribution. In\nparticular, according to our calculations the component around \u223c 105 eV and \u223c 209 eV\nare explained by the 5 \u2192 3 and 3 \u2192 2 Coulomb transitions, respectively. Besides, the\nrelative yields of high energy components at the energies \u223c 105 eV and \u223c 209 eV are in\n6\n\n\fgood agreement with the experimental data [7]. Thus in contrast to previous theoretical\nstudies the prediction of the present cascade model are in good agreement with the neutron\ntime-of-flight spectrum at LHD.\n\n0.014\n\ndensity LHD\n\n4\u21922\n\n3\u21922\n\n5\u21923\n\n6\u21923\n\n4\u21923\n\n6\u21924\n\n6\u21925\n\n0.01\n\n5\u21924\n\n0.012\n\n0.008\n0.006\n0.004\n0.002\n0\n0\n\n100\n\n50\n\n150\n\n200\n\n300\n\n250\n\nE, eV\n\nFigure 6: The kinetic energy distribution of \u03c0 \u2212 p at the instant of the nuclear absorption in\nliquid hydrogen: the experimental data [7] ( on the left) in comparison with the results of\nthe present cascade calculations (on the right)\nIn order to illustrate both the importance of the CD transitions with \u2206n > 1 and\nstrength of the CD transitions with \u2206n = 1 the three variants of the cascade calculations\nwere performed: full calculation where all CD transitions are taken into account, the calculation with only \u2206n = 1 CD transitions and, finally, the calculation with \u2206n = 1 CD\ntransitions decreased by factor kCD = 0.1.

The inclusion in the cascade code the results of the detailed\nquantum mechanical calculations of the differential and integral cross sections for nl 7\u2192 n\u2032 l\u2032\ncollisional transitions allowed us to describe the kinetics of the atomic cascade without\nemploying any fitting parameters and more accurately.\nThe predictions of this cascade model are in a good agreement with the experimental data\nboth for muonic and pionic hydrogen atoms. In particularly, the present cascade calculations allow for the fist time to explain the observed kinetic energy distribution of \u03c0 \u2212 p atoms\nat the instant of nuclear reaction. Our results explain the high energy components around\n\u223c 105 eV and \u223c 209 eV (due to 5 \u2192 3 and 3 \u2192 2 Coulomb transitions) and lead to a very\ngood agreement with the experimental weights of these components.\n\n5\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors would like to thank L.
