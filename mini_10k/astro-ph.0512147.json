We use calibrated\nphotometric redshift together with spectroscopic redshift for 25% of the sample. The\naccuracy reached in the photometric redshift estimate is 0.06 (rms) and the fraction\nof outliers is 1%. We find that the rest-frame Js-band luminosities obtained by extrapolating the observed Js-band photometry are consistent with those obtained by\nextrapolating the photometry in the redder H and Ks bands closer to the rest-frame Js,\nat least up to z \u223c 2. Moreover, we find no significant differences among the luminosities obtained with different spectral libraries. Thus, our LF estimate is not dependent\neither on the extrapolation made on the best-fitting template or on the library of models used to fit the photometry. The selected sample has allowed to probe the evolution\nof the LF in the three redshift bins [0;0.8), [0.8;1.9) and [1.9;4) centered at the median\nredshift zm \u2243 [0.6, 1.2, 3] and to probe the LF at zm \u2243 0.6 down to the unprecedented\nfaint luminosities MJs \u2243 \u221213 and MKs \u2243 \u221214. We find hints of a raise of the faint\nend (MJs > \u221217 and MKs > \u221218) near-IR LF at zm \u223c 0.6, raise which cannot be\nprobed at higher redshift with our sample. The values of \u03b1 we estimate are consistent\nwith the local value and do not show any trend with redshift. We do not see evidence\nof evolution from z = 0 to zm \u223c 0.6 suggesting that the population of local bright\ngalaxies was already formed at z < 0.8. On the contrary, we clearly detect an evolution\nof the LF to zm \u223c 1.2 characterized by a brightening of M\u2217 and by a decline of \u03c6\u2217 . To\nzm \u223c 1.2 M\u2217 brightens by about 0.4-0.6 mag and \u03c6\u2217 decreases by a factor 2-3. This\ntrend persists, even if at a less extent, down to zm \u223c 3 both in the Js-band and in\nthe Ks-band LF. The decline of the number density of bright galaxies seen at z > 0.8\nsuggests that a significant fraction of them increases their stellar mass at 1 < z < 2 \u2212 3\nand that they underwent a strong evolution in this redshift range. On the other hand,\nthis implies also that a significant fraction of local bright/massive galaxies was already\nin place at z > 3. Thus, our results suggest that the assembly of massive galaxies is\nspread over a large redshift range and that the increase of their stellar mass has been\nvery efficient also at very high redshift at least for a fraction of them.\nKey words: Galaxies: evolution \u2013 Galaxies: luminosity function \u2013 Galaxies: formation.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe luminosity function (LF) of galaxies is a fundamental statistical tool to study the populations of galaxies. Its\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: saracco@brera.mi.astro.it\n\ndependence on morphological type, on wavelength and on\nlook-back time provides constraints on the evolution of the\nproperties of the whole population of galaxies, of the populations of various morphological types and on their contribution to the luminosity density at different wavelength. The\nparameters derived by the best-fitting of the LF, the char-\n\n\f2\n\nP. Saracco et al.\n\nacteristic luminosity M\u2217 , the slope \u03b1 and the normalization\n\u03c6\u2217 , provide strong constraints to the models of galaxy formation.\nThe recent estimates of the LF based on local wide surveys in the optical, such as the Two Degree Field (2dF;\nFolkes et al. 1999; Madgwick et al. 2002; Norberg et al.\n2002) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; Blanton et\nal. 2003) and in the near-IR, such as the Two Micron All\nSky Survey (2MASS; Kochanek et al. 2001), have provided a\ncomprehensive view of the local LF for different morphological types and wavelengths. It is now well established that\nthe LF depends on morphological type, that the faint-end is\nincreasingly dominated by galaxies with late-type morphology and spectra and that their number density increases\ngoing to lower luminosities. On the contrary, the bright-end\nis dominated by early-type galaxies whose fraction increases\nwith luminosities (e.g. Marzke et al. 1994, 1998; Folkes et\nal. 1999; Kochanek et al. 2001; Bell et al. 2003).\nThe studies of the LF based on optically selected redshift surveys at z < 1 have provided the first evidences of\na differential evolution of galaxies. Lilly et al. (1995a), using the Canada France Redshift Survey (CFRS; Lilly et al.\n1995b) show that the rest-frame B-band LF of the blue population of galaxies brightens by about 1 mag to z \u223c 1 contrary to the red population which shows a little evolution\nover the redshift range probed. They used the observed Iband photometry to derive the rest-frame B-band luminosities. Subsequent studies confirmed the different behaviors\nfollowed by the LF of the different populations of galaxies\nat various redshifts (e.g. Lin et al. 1997; Liu et al. 1998)\nand the differential evolution they underwent (e.g. Bell et\nal. 2004; Wolf et al. 2003). At higher redshift (z > 1) the\nstudies of the LF in the optical rest-frame confirm the presence of the bi-modality and provide evidences of luminosity\nand of density evolution down to z \u223c 2 \u2212 3 (e.g. Poli et al.\n2003; Gabasch et al.2004; Giallongo et al. 2005).\nContrary to the light at UV and at optical wavelengths,\nthe near-IR light is less affected by dust extinction and by\nongoing star formation e.g. Rix & Riecke 1993; Kauffmann &\nCharlot 1998). Moreover, since the near-IR light of a galaxy\nis dominated by the evolved population of stars, the nearIR light is weakly dependent on galaxy type and it is more\nrelated to the stellar mass of the galaxy. Therefore, the evolution of the LF of galaxies in the near-IR rest-frame can\nprovide important clues on the history of the stellar mass\nassembly in the Universe rather than on the evolution of the\nstar formation.\nThe studies of the K-band luminosity function conducted so far have shown no or little evolution of the population of galaxies at z < 0.4 \u2212 0.5 (e.g. Glazebrook et al.\n1995; Feulner et al. 2003; Pozzetti et al. 2003) with respect\nto the local population (Kochaneck et al. 2001; Cole et al.\n2001; Glazebrook et al. 1995; Gardner et al. 1997). On the\ncontrary, evidences of evolution emerge at z > 0.5, even if\nsome discrepancies are present among the results obtained\nby the various authors (see e.g. Cowie et al. 1996; Pozzetti et\nal. 2003; Drory et al. 2003; Caputi et al. 2004, 2005; Dahlen\net al. 2005). One of the possible reasons of these discrepancies is related to the rest-frame K-band luminosities, usually\nextrapolated from the observed K-band photometry making\nuse of the best-fitting template which should reproduce the\nunknown SED of the galaxy. To minimize the uncertain-\n\nties, photometry at wavelengths long-wards the rest-frame\nK-band would be required. Given the obvious difficulties in\ngetting deep mid-IR observations, some authors have used\nthe observed K-band magnitudes to construct the rest-frame\nJ-band LF (e.g. Pozzetti et al. 2003; Bolzonella et al. 2002;\nDahlen et al. 2005) and to constrain the evolution of the LF\nin the near-IR. Another reason could be that deep K-band\nobservations allowing a good sampling of the LF at magnitudes fainter than M\u2217 over a wide redshift range are not\nso common. Consequently the LF faint-wards of the knee\nis progressively less constrained with increasing redshift affecting the LF estimate.\nIn this work, we aim at measuring the rest-frame Jsband and Ks-band LF of galaxies and its evolution to z \u2243 3\nthrough a sample of about 300 galaxies selected at Ks6 23\non the Hubble Deep Field-South (HDF-S). The extremely\ndeep near-IR observations collected on this field coupled\nwith the optical HST data have allowed us to probe the LF\nover a wide redshift range and to sample the faint end of the\nLF down to unprecedented faint luminosities. We use photometric redshift spectroscopically calibrated with a sample of\nmore than 230 spectroscopic redshift, \u223c 80 of which in the\nHDF-S. We pay particular attention to the calculation of\nthe rest-frame near-IR luminosities by comparing different\nmethods and libraries of models. In \u00a72 we describe the photometric catalogue and the criteria adopted to construct the\nfinal sample of galaxies used to derive the LF. In \u00a73 we describe the procedure used to obtain calibrated photometric\nredshifts and we present the redshift and color distribution\nof galaxies. In \u00a74 we discuss the derivation of the rest-frame\nJs-band and Ks-band absolute magnitudes and assess the\ninfluence of the different estimates on the LF. The resulting\nLF at various redshifts is derived in \u00a75. In \u00a76 our LFs are\ncompared with the local estimates and with those previously\nobtained by other authors at comparable redshift to depict\nthe evolution of the LF of galaxies up to z \u223c 3. In \u00a77 we\nsummarize and discuss the results.\nThroughout this paper, magnitudes are in the Vega system unless explicitly stated otherwise.

The formal limiting magnitudes (3\u03c3 within 0.2 arcsec2 ) reached are\n26.7, 29.1 29.5, 28.6, 26.2, 24.5 and 24.4 in the U300 , B450 ,\nV606 , I814 , Js, H and Ks bands respectively. The detection\nhas been performed using SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts\n1996) on the Ks-band image. The Ks-band magnitude is the\nMAG BEST measured by SExtractor while the colors have\nbeen measured within the Ks-band detection isophote by\nusing SExtractor in double image mode. The near-IR data\nreduction, the detection and the magnitude estimate are described in detail in Saracco et al. (2001; 2004). To construct\n\n\fThe evolution of the near-IR LF of galaxies to z \u223c 3\n\nFigure 1. Upper panel \u2013 Ks-band number counts as resulting\nfrom the whole sample of 610 galaxies detected in the HDF-S.\nThe counts raise till Ks\u2243 24 and drop at fainter magnitudes in\nagreement with the 100% completenes estimated at Ks\u2243 23.2.\nLower panel \u2013 Photometric errors as a function of Ks-band magnitude for the whole sample of galaxies in the HDF-S. At Ks\u2243 23\nthe photometric error is still lower than 0.2 mag for most of the\ngalaxies while is much larger at fainter magnitudes. The dotted\nline marks the limiting magnitude of the K23 selected sample.\n\nour catalog, we considered the area of the HDF-S fully covered by all the images in the various bands resulting in an\narea of \u223c 5.5 arcmin2 . On this area we detected 610 sources\nat Ks< 26. In Fig. 1 the observed number counts are shown.\nFrom this Ks-band selected catalog we extracted a complete sample of galaxies to derive the LF. On the basis of\nthe simulations described in Saracco et al. (2001), we estimated that our catalogue is 100% complete at Ks\u2243 23.2.\nThis is consistent with the number counts shown in Fig.\n1 which raise till Ks\u2243 24. Down to Ks\u2243 23 the near-IR\nphotometric errors are lower than 0.2 magnitudes while\nthey rapidly increase at fainter magnitudes as shown in\nthe lower panel of Fig. 1 making very uncertain the photometric redshift estimate. Thus, according to these considerations, we constructed the sample by selecting all the\nsources (332) brighter than Ks=23 (K23 sample hereafter).\nWe then identified and removed the stars from the K23\nsample relying both on the SExtractor star/galaxy classifier and on the colors of the sources. In Fig. 2 the stellar index (CLASS STAR) computed by SExtractor for the\n332 sources of the K23 sample is shown as a function of\nthe Ks-band apparent magnitude. For magnitudes brighter\nthan Ks\u2243 21 point like sources (CLASS STAR\u2243 1) and extended sources (CLASS STAR\u2243 0) are well segregated while\nthey tend to mix at fainter magnitudes. We defined stellar\ncandidates those sources with magnitudes Ks< 21 having a\nCLASS STAR> 0.95 both in the Ks-band image and in the\nI814 -band image. We obtained a sample of 23 stellar candidates. Among them, 7 bright (Ks< 18.5) sources display\nspikes in the HST-WFPC images implying that they are\n\n3\n\nFigure 2. Sextractor stellar index (CLASS STAR) as a function\nof Ks magnitude for the 332 sources brighter than Ks=23.\n\nmost likely stars. For the remaining 16 candidates we verified that their optical and near-IR colors were compatible\nwith those of stars. In Fig. 3 the colors Js-Ks and V606 I814 of the K23 sample are plotted as a function of the Ks\nmagnitude and of the Js-Ks color respectively. The 16 star\ncandidates and the 7 bright stars are marked by filled points\nand starred symbols respectively. As can be seen, all but 2\nof the candidates occupy the stellar locus at J-K< 0.9 and\nare well segregated both in the color-magnitude and in the\ncolor-color plane. On the contrary, the two candidates lying far from the stellar locus of Fig. 3 display colors not\ncompatible with those of stars. In particular, while their JK color (J-K> 1.3) could be consistent with the near-IR\ncolor of an M6-M8 spectral type, the other optical colors\ndiffer even more than 2 magnitudes from those characterizing these stars. Thus, these two sources are most probably\nmisclassified compact galaxies. This has made us to classify\n21 stars out of the 23 candidates originally selected on the\nbasis of the SExtractor stellar index at Ks< 21.\nAt magnitudes fainter than Ks=21 other sources (18) lie\nin the locus occupied by stars defined by a color J-K< 0.9.\nBy a visual inspection of the 18 sources on the HST images we clearly identified the extended profile for 7 of them.\nOn the contrary, the remaining 11 sources have FWHM and\nsurface brightness profile consistent with a point-like source.\nWe probed the stellar nature of these 11 star candidates by\ncomparing their observed spectral energy distribution (SED)\ndefined by broad-band photometry with a set of spectral\ntemplates of stellar atmospheres from the Kurucz's atlas\n(Kurucz 19931 ). The observed SEDs of all the 11 star candidates are very well fitted by those of M and K stars. All\nbut one are not targets of spectroscopic observations, as we\nverified through the ESO archive data available.

Among them, we marked with starred symbols those sources clearly\nidentified as stars because showing spikes in the HDF-WFPC images.\n\nconfirms its stellar nature as M star. In the left panel of\nFig. 4 we show the reduced \u03c72 of the best fitting template\nto the SED of the 18 sources with J-K< 0.9 obtained with\nthe stellar atmosphere templates of Kurucz (\u03c7\u03032star ) and with\nthe stellar population templates of BC03 (\u03c7\u03032gal ). It is interesting to note the effectiveness of this method in identifying\nstars and galaxies among faint K-selected objects. In the\nright panel of Fig. 4 we show, as example, the SEDs of 5\nout of the 11 stars together with the relevant best-fitting\nKurucz's templates. Therefore, we classified stars also these\n11 sources and we removed a total of 32 stars from the K23\nsample which results in 300 galaxies.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nPHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFTS\nTemplates selection\n\nPhotometric redshifts have been derived by comparing the\nobserved flux densities to a set of synthetic templates based\non the latest version of the Bruzual & Charlot (2003) models. The \u03c72 minimization procedure of Hyperz (Bolzonella et\nal. 2000) has been used to obtain the best fitting templates.\nThe set of templates used has been selected among a large\ngrid of models to provide us with the most accurate estimate\nof the redshift for the galaxies in our photometric sample.\nThe grid from which we selected the final set of templates,\nincludes declining SFRs with time scale \u03c4 in the range 0.115 Gyr besides the Simple Stellar Population (SSP) and the\nConstant Star Formation (cst) models. The templates have\nbeen produced at solar metallicity with Salpeter, Scalo and\nMiller-Scalo initial mass functions (IMFs). Various ranges\nof extinction AV and two different extinction laws (Calzetti\net al. 2000 and Prevot et al. 1984) have been considered in\nthe best-fitting procedure.\nThe selection of the best set of templates has been per-\n\nTable 1.

This sample includes 151 galaxies in the HDF-N (Cohen et al. 2000; Dawson et al. 2001;\nFern\u00e1ndez-Soto et al. 2002) and 81 in the HDF-S (Vanzella\net al. 2002; Sawicki & Mall\u00e8n-Ornelas 2003; Labb\u00e9 et al.\n2003b; Trujillo et al. 2004; Rigopoulou et al. 2005) with\nknown spectroscopic redshift. The best set of templates is\nthe one minimizing the mean and the standard deviation\nof the residuals defined as \u2206z = (zp \u2212 zs )/(1 + zs ) and the\nnumber of outliers defined as those sources with \u2206z > 4\u03c3\u2206z .\nBoth mean and standard deviation are iteratively computed\napplying a 4\u03c3 clipping till the convergence. The final number\nof outliers includes all the galaxies removed by the clipping\nprocedure.\nThe set of templates and the range of extinction providing the best results are summarized in Tab. 1. It is worth\nnoting that the resulting best set does not include the SSP,\ncontrary to some of the previous photometric redshift analysis. This is due to the fact that SSP templates always provide\na better fit to the photometry then other SFHs but a wrong\nredshift estimate, typically lower than the real one. This results both in a larger deviation of the residuals from the null\n\n\fThe evolution of the near-IR LF of galaxies to z \u223c 3\n\n5\n\nFigure 4.

In Fig. 5 the photometric redshifts obtained with the best set of templates are compared\nto the spectroscopic redshift of the 232 galaxies of our control sample.

It can be seen\nfrom Fig. 5 that no correlation is present between the resid-\n\nuals and the redshift. We obtain three outliers (1%) over the\nredshift range 0 < z < 6, 2 out of which (IDs 892 and 242)\nin the HDF-S. Both these are well above the background on\nthe I814 -band image while their surface brightness appear\nvery faint in the Ks-band image.

It should be noted that both of them are\nfainter than Ks=23, the magnitude at which we selected the\ncomplete sample to derive the LF (see \u00a74 and \u00a75). In Tab.\n2, we report the values of h\u2206zi and of \u03c3\u2206z together with\nthe number of outliers relevant to the spectroscopic samples\nin the HDF-N, in the HDF-S and in the whole sample for\ndifferent redshift bins.\nWe verified the reliability of our photometric redshifts\nby comparing the spectroscopic and the photometric redshift\ndistributions of the 232 galaxies. In Fig. 6 the cumulative\ndistributions of the photometric and the spectroscopic redshift are shown. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test has provided a\nprobability P(KS )\u2243 40% that the two distributions belong\nto the same parent population confirming the reliability of\nour estimate. The same result has been obtained considering\nseparately the 151 galaxies in the HDF-N and the 81 in the\nHDF-S.\n\nevolved galaxies at 2 < z < 3 (Saracco et al. 2004). In Fig.\n8 we also plot the expected Js-Ks color obtained in the case\nof E(B-V)=0 assuming a declining star formation rate with\ntime scale \u03c4 = 1 Gyr seen at 5, 2 and 0.5 Gyr (from the top,\nthick lines) and a constant star formation (cst) seen at 1\nGyr (dot-dashed line). The 1 Gyr old cst model is reddened\nby E(B-V)=0.5 to account for dusty star-forming galaxies\n(dot-dashed line). Most of the galaxies lie within the region\nlimited by the 5 Gyr old model toward the red and by the\n0.5 Gyr old model toward the blue. The reddest galaxies of\nthe sample (at 2 < z < 3) can be described by old stellar\npopulations, i.e. populations with age comparable to the age\nof the Universe at the relevant redshift.\n\n3.2\n\nRedshift and color distributions\n\nOnce defined the set of templates and parameters providing\nthe most accurate estimate of the photometric redshift we\nhave run the \u03c72 minimization procedure on the complete\nsample of 300 galaxies at Ks623. For those galaxies having\na spectroscopic redshift (74 at Ks623), the best fitting has\nbeen constrained to the observed value. In Figure 7 the redshift distribution of the sample is shown. The distribution\nhas a median redshift zm = 1.15 and has a tail extending\nup to zp \u2243 6. There are 14 galaxies with photometric redshift zp > 4, 5 of which at 5 < zp 6 6. The Js-Ks color of\nthe 300 galaxies is shown in Fig. 8. Three of the Js-Ks>3\ngalaxies were noticed on shallower near-IR images (Saracco\net al. 2001) and previously analysed resulting in high-mass\n\n4\n\nK-CORRECTIONS AND NEAR-IR\nLUMINOSITIES\n\nThe estimate of the k-correction and of the absolute magnitude in the near-IR rest-frame is a critical step when dealing with high redshift galaxies. Indeed, unless having photometry sampling the near-IR rest-frame, it implies an extrapolation with respect to the observed wavelength. This\nextrapolation is usually based on the best-fitting template\nwhich should be a good approximation of the true (but unknown) SED of the galaxy. In fact, the larger the redshift,\nthe wider the extrapolation and, possibly, the uncertainty\naffecting the rest-frame near-IR luminosity. Moreover, this\nestimate can also be affected by systematics due to the different libraries of models which can differ substantially in\nthe near-IR domain. We have tried to assess whether and\nhow such uncertainties affect the estimate of the rest-frame\nnear-IR luminosity. We first checked the robustness of the\nrest-frame near-IR luminosity with respect to the extrapolated photometry and than with respect to the different\n\n\fThe evolution of the near-IR LF of galaxies to z \u223c 3\n\n7\n\nTable 2.

For each galaxy, we compared the rest-frame Jsband absolute magnitude obtained from the equation\nMJs (kJ ) = Js \u2212 5log(DL (z)) \u2212 25 \u2212 kJ (z)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere DL (z) is the luminosity distance at redshift z in units\nof Mpc, to the one derived by the equation\nMJs (kJ Y ) = mY \u2212 5log(DL (z)) \u2212 25 \u2212 kJ Y (z)\n\n(2)\n\nIn eq. 1 kJ (z) = (Js,rest \u2212 Js (z))temp is the conventional kcorrection obtained as the difference between the rest-frame\nand observed magnitude computed on the best-fitting template. To this end, the transmission curve of the ISAACJs filter has been multiplied with the best fitting template at rest and redshifted to z (where z = zs for the 74\ngalaxies with known redshift in the K23 sample). In eq. 2,\nkJ Y = (Js,rest \u2212Y (z))temp and mY is the observed apparent\n\n1/151\n\n(<1%)\n\n2/81\n\n(2%)\n\n3/232\n\n(1%)\n\nmagnitude in the filter Y that best matches the rest-frame\nJs-band of the galaxy at the relevant redshift (e.g. Lilly et\nal. 1995; Pozzetti et al. 2003). In our case Y=Js, H, Ks\naccording to the redshift of the galaxy. Both the \"color kcorrection\" terms,kJ (z) and kJ Y , include the flux density\ndimming factor (1 + z) independent of wavelength. In Fig.\n9 (left panel) the difference between the rest-frame Js-band\nabsolute magnitude derived for each galaxy from equations\n1 and 2 is plotted as a function of z. Up to z \u223c 2, where\nthe near-IR filters sample wavelengths \u03bbJ s > 0.4 \u03bcm and\n\u03bbKs > 0.7 \u03bcm, the two equations provide the same values\nwithin an rms of about 0.15 mag, comparable to or lower\nthan the typical photometric error. This dispersion does not\naffect the estimate of the LF. This is shown in the right panel\nof Fig. 9 where the distributions of the rest-frame Js-band\nabsolute magnitude derived from eq. 1 (solid histogram) and\nfrom eq. 2 (dotted histogram) are compared for galaxies in\ndifferent redshift bin. At z < 2, the two distributions belong to the same parent population as confirmed by the K-S\ntest we performed. At larger redshift, the conventional eq.\n1 provides absolute magnitudes which can differ systematically from those derived from eq. 2. These differences can\nbias the estimate of the LF. The absolute magnitude distributions shown in Fig. 9 for galaxies at z > 2 are indeed\nrather different, even if the difference is only marginally significant. Thus, until the near-IR band chosen to construct\nthe LF (the Js filter in our example) samples the part of\nthe SED red-wards \u03bb > 0.4 \u03bcm, characterized by a regular shape, dominated by the emission of older stars and\nweakly affected by dust extinction and star formation, eq. 1\nand 2 provide consistent absolute magnitudes. In this case,\nhaving photometry approaching the rest-frame wavelength\nof the chosen filter (the Ks-band in our example) and using eq. 2 do not improve the accuracy and the reliability of\nthe estimate of the LF. On the contrary, when the chosen\nnear-IR filter samples the blue and UV part of the spectrum\n(\u03bbJ s < 0.4 \u03bcm at z > 2), the observed emission in that filter\n(Js) is dominated by young (< 0.5 Gyr) stars which do not\ncontribute significantly to the red part of the spectrum, i.e.\nto the rest-frame luminosity we want to derive. Moreover, it\ncan be strongly affected by dust extinction. In this case the\nextrapolation to the near-IR rest-frame wavelength required\nby eq. 1 can give wrong values and the photometry in the\nredder band, the Ks filter in our case, is needed to apply eq.\n2.\n\n\f8\n\nP. Saracco et al.\n\nFigure 9. Left: The difference between the rest-frame Js-band absolute magnitude derived for each galaxy from eqs.1 and 2 is plotted as\na function of z. Right: The distribution of the Js-band absolute magnitude of galaxies derived from eq. 1 (solid histogram) are compared\nto the one derived from eq. 2 (dotted histogram) for different redshift bin. No significant differences are present between the distributions\nat z < 2 as confirmed by the high probability provided by the K-S test (small sub-panels).\n\nWe then checked the dependence of the LF on the different library of models used to derive the best-fitting template. Recently, Maraston (2005; M05 hereafter) has shown\nthe importance of the TP-AGB phase in modeling young\nstellar populations. This evolutionary phase can play an important role in the continuum emission of a stellar population at \u03bb > 0.4 \u2212 0.5 \u03bcm with ages younger than 1 Gyr.\nThe modeling of this phase in the Maraston's code produces\na brightening in the near-IR with respect to the same stellar populations (equal age, IMF and metallicity) modeled by\nthe Bruzual & Charlot (2003) and PEGASE (Fioc & RoccaVolmerange 1997) codes. To assess whether this difference\naffect the estimate of the LF, we compared the distributions\nof the Ks-band absolute magnitudes obtained with the BC03\nmodels and with the M05 models. We did not include the\nPEGASE models in this comparison since they provide spectral energy distributions very similar to those of BC03. We\nconstructed the same set of templates described in Tab. 1\nusing the SSPs of M05 and we searched for, for each galaxy,\nthe best-fitting template at the relevant redshift. In Fig. 10\nthe absolute magnitude distributions obtained with the two\nsets of models for the whole sample of galaxies at z < 4 and\nin three redshift bin are shown. The K-S test we performed\ndoes not show evidence of difference between the distributions providing probabilities P(KS )> 0.8 in all the redshift\nbin.\nThe above results show that our study of the LF and\nof its evolution with redshift is not dependent either on the\nmethod used to derive the rest-frame absolute magnitudes\nor on the library of templates used at least down to z \u2243 2.\nTherefore, we are confident of the reliability of our estimate\nof the LF at least down to this redshift. However, we chose\nto push our study of the LF at z < 4 since the Ks-band still\n\nsamples the red part (\u03bbKs > 0.45 \u03bcm) of the SED down to\nthis redshift limit. We will use eq. 2 to derive the rest-frame\nJs-band absolute magnitudes and the conventional form of\neq. 1 to compute the Ks-band absolute magnitudes. In Fig.\n11 the Ks-band k-correction derived for the sample of 285\ngalaxies at z < 4 is shown as a function of redshift. For comparison, superimposed on the data, we plot the k-correction\nas derived by 3 synthetic templates (continuous lines) obtained with a declining star formation rate seen at three\ndifferent ages, (from the top) 5, 2 and 0.5 Gyr. Besides the\nmodels, we also plot (dashed line) the k-correction derived\nby the mean observed spectrum of local elliptical galaxies\n(Mannucci et al. 2001).\n\n5\n5.1\n\nTHE NEAR-IR LUMINOSITY FUNCTION\nIN THE HDF-S\nComputing the LF with 1/Vmax method\n\nWe computed the luminosity function, \u03a6(M )dM , using\nthe non-parametric 1/Vmax method (Schmidt 1968). This\nmethod does not require any assumption on the form of the\nLF and provides an unbiased estimate if the sample is not\naffected by strong density inhomogeneities. Previous studies\nof the LF of galaxies in the HDFs obtained with different\nestimators, both parametric and non-parametric (Takeuchi\net al. 2000; Bolzonella et al. 2002), show no differences with\nrespect to the LF obtained with the Vmax formalism.

According to this criterion and to the results obtained\nin \u00a74, we divided the sample of 285 galaxies at z < 4 in\nthe three redshift bins [0;0.8), [0.8;1.9) and [1.9;4). Each\nbin includes 101, 100 and 84 galaxies of which 52 (50%), 12\n(12%) and 10 (12%) with spectroscopic redshift respectively.\nThe median redshifts in the three bin are zm = 0.55, zm =\n1.2 and zm = 3.1 respectively.\nThe rest-frame Js-band and Ks-band LFs we derived in\neach redshift bin are shown in Fig. 12 and 13 respectively\n(filled points). The starred symbols denote the LF uncorrected for the incompleteness and show where the 1/Vmax\ncorrection takes place. In Fig. 12, the Js-band LF obtained\nwith the rest-frame Js-band absolute magnitudes derived\nfrom eq. 1 is also shown (empty points). The figures suggest\na systematic decrease of the number density of bright galaxies coupled with a systematic brightening of the LF going\nto high redshift. This trend is present both in the Js-band\nLF and in the Ks-band LF. We will probe further these\nfeatures in the next section. Besides this, the figures are\nalso suggestive of a raise of the LF at faint absolute magnitudes (MJ s > \u221217 and MKs > \u221218) in the lowest redshift\nbin, raise which cannot be probed in the two bins at higher\nredshift where brighter galaxies are selectively missed. The\nsame slope of the faint end is obtained by computing the LF\nin the redshift range 0 < z < 0.4 suggesting that the raise\nis not due to possible exceeding values of 1/Vmax . However, it is worth noting that the raise we see is based on\na very low statistics. Indeed, the faint end is defined by 9\nout of the 12 galaxies at 0.1 < z < 0.3 in our sample. It\n\nis indeed expected that, given the criteria adopted to select\nthe HDF-S (devoid of bright sources), galaxies at low redshift in this field are low luminosity galaxies (MK >-20).\nThis, coupled with the very faint limit (Ks=23) of the sample, allows to probe the faint end of the luminosity function at hzi \u2243 0.2 down to the unprecedented faint nearIR magnitude M\u2243 \u221214. These low luminosity galaxies are\nslightly bluer in the optical (0.45<V606 -I814 < 0.9) than the\nbulk of the galaxies in the HDF-S while their optical-IR colors (1.4<I814 -Ks< 2.7, 0.9<Js-Ks<1.5) are consistent with\nthose of the bulk. All but one are brighter than V=25.8 and\nI=24.9 and are in the range 21<Ks< 22.9. Most of them\nshow an irregular morphology while two of them appear\nvery compact. In Fig. 14 the V606 (upper panels) and the\nI814 -band (lower panels) images of 7 out of the 9 galaxies\nat z < 0.3 fainter than MK =-18 are shown. Both the apparent raise of the LF at faint luminosities and the irregular\nmorphology of the galaxies populating the faint end are consistent with previous estimates of the local LF of galaxies\nat optical wavelengths. Such estimates show that the faint\nend of the near-IR LF is dominated by irregular and dwarf\ngalaxies whose contribution to the comoving number density increases going to lower luminosities as found for the\nlocal LF in the optical rest-frame (e.g. Marzke et al. 1994;\nMarzke et al. 1998; Zucca et al. 1997; Folkes et al. 1999).\nWe estimated a comoving number density of galaxies with\nmagnitude -19<MK <-14 of n\u0304f aint = 0.4 \u00b1 0.27 Mpc\u22123 at\nhzi \u2243 0.2. This value agrees with the one derived locally\nby Zucca et al. (1997) for galaxies Mbj > \u221217 and it is\nnearly one order of magnitude higher than the comoving\ndensity of brighter galaxies (n\u0304bright = 0.039 \u00b1 0.005 Mpc\u22123\nfor MK < \u221219). However, the very low statistic, the uncertainty in the photometric redshift estimate and the small\nvolume sampled by the HDF-S, especially at low redshift,\nprevent us to strongly constrain the faint end of the LF.\nThe possible raise we see at very faint near-IR luminosities\nneeds a larger sample to be established.\n5.2\n\nThe evolution of the LF of galaxies in the\nHDF-S\n\nIn Figs. 12 and 13 we plot the formal fitting to the LFs we\nobtained with a Schechter function (Schechter 1976). The\nfitting is performed over the whole range of absolute magnitude spanned by the LFs in each redshift bin. The results\nof the fitting are summarized in Tab. 3 where we report the\nvalues of the parameters \u03b1, M\u2217 and \u03c6\u2217 in each redshift bin.\nIn Fig. 15 the errors contour at 68% confidence level for the\njoint parameters [\u03b1, M\u2217 ] and [\u03c6\u2217 , M\u2217 ] of the Ks-band LF fit\nare shown. The decreasing number density and the possible\nbrightening previously noticed in the LFs going to high redshift are evident in the plot. However, given the statistical\ncorrelation between the Schechter parameters (\u03b1, M\u2217 and\n\u03c6\u2217 ), we will probe further on the significance of this evolution by fixing the \u03b1 parameter. Fig. 15 suggests also that\nwe cannot constrain the faint end of the LF and thus the\nparameter \u03b1 at high redshift. However, we tried to constrain\nthe evolution of the LF shape by means of the K-S test (see\ne.g. Feulner et al. 2003) which uses all the absolute magnitudes without binning. We derived in each redshift bin the\ncumulative LF (CLF) which gives the number of galaxies\nper unit volume brighter than M.

Since\nthe K-S test compares the CLFs normalized to unit, this test\nis not able to detect variations of \u03c6\u2217 . The normalized CLFs\n\nprovide information on the relevant distribution of galaxies\nwithin the range of absolute magnitude considered, i.e. on\nthe form of the LF. For this reason we expect that the K-S\ntest is more sensitive to the variation of \u03b1 which defines the\nform of the distribution rather than of M\u2217 .\nTo quantify the sensitivity of the K-S test to the variations of \u03b1 and M\u2217 for samples of the same size of our sample\nwe simulated and compared among them various samples of\n100 objects described by a Schechter LF with different values\nof \u03b1 and M\u2217 . We have found that, at 90% confidence level,\nthe minimum variations we are able to detect on \u03b1 and M\u2217\non our samples are \u00b10.3 and \u00b10.8 mag respectively. In the\nlower panel of Fig. 16 the normalized CLFs obtained in the\nthree redshift bin are compared two by two (lowest vs mid\nredshift bin (upper panel) and mid vs highest redshift bin\n(lower panel)). The K-S test does not point out significant\ndifferences among the distributions as shown by the probabilities PKS \u22430.61 (bin 1 vs bin 2) and PKS \u22430.24 (bin 2\nvs bin 3). Thus, we conclude that if \u03b1 changes its variation\nhas to be lower than 0.3 from zm \u2243 0.6 to zm \u2243 3.\nWe then probed the evolution of M\u2217 and \u03c6\u2217 by compar-\n\n\f12\n\nP.

We assumed the value \u03b1 = \u22121.0 since it is\nvery close to the values we derived in each redshift bin and\nto the values previously derived by other authors for local\ngalaxies (e.g. Kochanek et al. 2001; Loveday 2000). The results of the fitting are summarized in Tab. 4 and shown in\nFig. 17. The possible brightening combined to the decreasing\nnumber density of bright galaxies previously noticed in the\nLF from zm \u2243 0.6 to zm \u2243 1.2 is confirmed and, possibly, it\nextends to zm \u223c 3. The normalization of the LF and, consequently, the number density of bright galaxies decreases\nby a factor 3 from zm \u2243 0.6 to zm \u2243 1.2. In parallel, the\ncharacteristic magnitude M\u2217 brightens by \u223c 0.4 mag. The\nevolution of \u03c6\u2217 is detected at high confidence level (> 3\u03c3),\nas shown by the error contours shown in Fig. 18 while the\n\nsignificance of the brightening of M\u2217 is 1\u03c3. The same trend\npersists, even if at a low confidence level for \u03c6\u2217 (< 2\u03c3), from\nzm \u2243 1.2 to zm \u2243 3 where \u03c6\u2217 (z \u223c 3) \u2243 0.5\u03c6\u2217 (z \u223c 1.2)\nand M\u2217 brightens by \u223c 0.4 mag. It is worth noting that\nthis evolution is not dependent on the value assumed for \u03b1.\nIndeed, by assuming \u03b1 = \u22121.1 we obtain for the Ks-band\nLF fit M\u2217 (z \u223c 0.6) = \u221224.62 and \u03c6\u2217 (z \u223c 0.6) = 0.0045\nMpc\u22123 to be compared with M\u2217 (z \u223c 1.2) = \u221225.03 and\n\u03c6\u2217 (z \u223c 1.2) = 0.0016 Mpc\u22123 , resulting in the same luminosity and density evolution (see Tab. 4).\n\n\fThe evolution of the near-IR LF of galaxies to z \u223c 3\nTable 4.

In Fig. 19 the fitting Schechter functions\nobtained by the various authors are shown in the range of\nabsolute magnitudes reached by the surveys according to the\n\n13\n\nvalues reported in Tab. 5 (MK (min)). We first compared the\nKs-band LF we derived at zm \u2243 0.6 with those derived on\nlocal samples of galaxies in order to probe and to constrain\nthe evolution of the LF on the last 4 Gyrs. In particular,\nwe considered the LFs of Cole et al. (2001), Kochanek et al.\n(2001) and that of Loveday (2000). These three local LFs\nare consistent among them. The former two are based on\nthe largest samples of local galaxies while the latter extends\ndown to very faint luminosities (MK (min)\u2243 \u221216). In Fig.\n19 the three local LFs are superimposed to the LF we derived at zm \u2243 0.6 (left upper panel) based on 101 galaxies\n50% of which with spectroscopic redshift. The agreement\nwith the LFs of Kochanek et al. and of Loveday et al. is\nrather good. The largest deviation is respect to the LF of\nCole et al. However, this deviation is not significant as also\nconfirmed by the K-S test which gives PKS \u2243 0.5. The characteristic magnitude of the Schechter function we derive at\nzm \u223c 0.6 are consistent with the local value (see Tab. 5)\neven is systematically brighter of about 0.2-0.3 magnitude\nwhile no differences are found in the normalization \u03c6\u2217 . Thus,\nthe comparison with the local near-IR LF of galaxies does\nnot point out evidence of strong luminosity and/or density\nevolution at z < 0.8. Given the statistical errors of our estimate we conclude that the near-IR LF has evolved not more\nthan 0.2-0.3 magnitude in the last 4 Gyr.\nWe then compared our LF at zm \u223c 0.6 with those derived at comparable redshift. In the right upper panel of Fig.\n19 the Schechter functions representing the LFs obtained by\nGlazebrook et al. (1995), Feulner et al. (2003), Bolzonella\net al. (2002) and Pozzetti et al. (2003) at z \u223c 0.5 are superimposed to our estimate. Glazebrook et al. and Feulner\net al. derive the LF assuming a value of \u03b1 of -1.0 and -1.1\nrespectively. The LF we obtained with these values of \u03b1,\nsummarized in Tab. 4, are in very good agreement with the\nresults of Glazebrook et al. and of Feulner et al. The largest\ndeviations are respect to the LF of Bolzonella et al. and of\nPozzetti et al. Both these LFs are characterized by values\nof \u03b1 steeper and by brighter characteristic magnitudes with\nrespect both to our and to the other LFs at these and at\nlower redshift. The K-S test we performed shows that the\ndeviation from the LF of Pozzetti et al. is not significant\n(PKS \u2243 0.15) while it is significant (PKS \u2243 0.02) the deviation from the LF of Bolzonella et al. This latter result, rather\nsurprising since we deal with the same field, is also evident\nby comparing the LF we obtained at higher redshift. In the\nlower left panel of Fig. 19 the LFs obtained by Pozzetti et al.\nat 0.75 < z < 1.3, by Kashikawa et al. (2003) at 1 < z < 1.5\nand by Bolzonella et al. at 1 < z < 2 are superimposed to\nthe one we obtained in the redshift range 0.8 6 z < 1.9.\nThe agreement with the LF of Pozzetti et al. is remarkable.\nOn the contrary, it is evident that our LF is not consistent\nwith the LFs of Bolzonella et al. and of Kashikawa et al.\nwho find a very steep (\u03b1 < \u22121.35) LF coupled with a very\nbright (M\u2217K < \u221225.5) characteristic magnitude. In both the\ncases the K-S test gives a probability less than 1% that the\ndistributions are drawn from the same parent population.\nThis is shown in Fig. 20 where the cumulative distributions\nrelevant to these LFs are shown. The reasons of this disagreement have to be searched both in the different samples\nand magnitudes used by Bolzonella et al. and Kashikawa et\nal.\nAs to the LF of Bolzonella et al., even if relevant to the\n\n\f14\n\nP.

The rest-frame Ks-band luminosity function derived with the 1/Vmax (points) and LF Schechter fitting (solid curve) are\ncompared with the LFs obtained by various authors (Koch.= Kochaneck; Love.= Loveday; Glaz.= Glazebrook; Feul.= Feulner; Bolz.=\nBolzonella; Pozz.= Pozzetti; Kash.= Kashikawa). In the upper-left panel the LF we derived in the redshift bin zm \u2243 0.6 is compared\nwith the local K-band LFs. In the other panels our estimates are compared with those obtained by other authors at comparable redshift:\nz \u2243 0.5 (upper right), z \u2243 1 (lower left) and z \u2243 3 (lower right).\n\nHDF-S, it is based on a near-IR sample extracted from an\noptically selected catalogue (Vanzella et al. 2001). At variance with respect to our sample, detection and magnitude\nestimates were performed and optimized on optical HST images. Moreover, the selection and the completeness of the\nnear-IR sample extracted by Bolzonella et al. are based on\nthe I814 -Ks color distribution. The near-IR data are 4 times\nshallower than those used in the present work and, consequently, the sample is \u223c 1 magnitude shallower. It should\nalso be noted that 25% of our sample (50% of the sample at\nz < 0.8) has spectroscopic redshift and that these redshifts\nhave been used both to optimize the photometric redshift\nand to estimate the LF. All that implies differences in the\nnear-IR magnitude estimates which can account for the different LF obtained.\nAs to the comparison with the LF of Kashikawa et al.,\nno obvious reasons can be put for the disagreement we obtained in this redshift bin. Cosmic variance affecting such\nsmall areas can affect the two samples accounting for this\ndiscrepancy. In the highest redshift bin considered, zm \u2243 3,\n\nthe disagreement is even larger as shown in the lower-right\npanel of Fig. 19. At this redshift, the Ks-band samples restframe wavelengths \u03bb \u223c 0.55 \u03bcm and the large extrapolation\nneeded to derive the rest-frame Ks-band luminosity can be\nstrongly dependent on the best-fitting template. In this case,\nas suggested by the analysis we presented in \u00a75, different\ntemplates could imply different LFs. However, it should be\nnoted that the disagreement is based on the comparison of\nour LF with the Schechter fit found by Kashikawa et al.\nand not with their data-points. The few data-points defining their LF in the two highest redshift bin (Fig. 5 of their\npaper) suggest that the Schechter parameters could not be\nso strongly constrained and that the disagreement could be\nless severe.\nThe agreement with the Ks-band LFs derived by other\nauthors at redshift comparable to z \u223c 0.6 and to z \u223c 1.2\nconfirms the evolution we detect in the LF of galaxies\nin the HDF-S, i.e. a brightening \u2206M \u2217 \u2243 \u22120.4 coupled\nwith a decrease of the number density of bright galaxies\n\u2206\u03c6\u2217 /\u03c6\u2217 \u2243 \u22120.65 from zm \u223c 0.6 to zm \u223c 1.2 for \u03b1 = \u22121.0.\n\n\fThe evolution of the near-IR LF of galaxies to z \u223c 3\n\nFigure 20. Comparison among the cumulative LFs derived at\nz \u2243 1.2 normalized over the same range of absolute magnitude.\nThe solid histogram is the CLF we derived with the 1/Vmax . The\nprobability that the cumulative distributions derived by the LF\nof Bolzonella et al. (dotted line) and of Kashikawa et al. (dashed\nline) are drawn from the population our LF belongs to is less than\n1%.\n\nAt larger redshift, the uncertainties in the estimate of restframe Ks-band luminosities due to the extrapolation based\non the best-fitting template could affect the LF estimates\nand mid-IR observations would be useful. However, even\nif our LF at zm \u2243 3 deviates from the other LFs at this\nredshift, these latter LFs trace the same trend we observe\nsuggesting that the evolution we detect at z < 2 extends to\nz > 3.\n6.2\n\nThe Js-band LF\n\nAnalogous results are obtained by the comparison of our\nJs-band LF estimates with those previously obtained at\ncomparable redshift. The comparison is shown in Fig. 21\nand extends down to zm \u223c 1.2 since no Js-band LFs have\nbeen estimated at higher redshift by other authors. The local Js-band LF of Cole et al. (2001; MJ\u2217 = \u221223.13 and\n\u03c6\u2217 = 0.4 * 10\u22123 Mpc\u22123 ) and the local LF of Balogh et\nal. (2001, MJ\u2217 = \u221223.02) are consistent with our LF at\nzm \u223c 0.6. Thus, as in the case of the Ks-band, we do not\nfind evidence of strong evolution of the LF at z < 0.6. However, in agreement with the Ks-band LF, we point out a\nbrightening of M\u2217J s of about 0.2-0.3 magnitude from z = 0\nto zm \u223c 0.6.\nThe Js-band LFs obtained at z \u223c 0.5 by the various\nauthors show a much larger scatter than those obtained in\nthe Ks-band at comparable redshift. As for the Ks-band,\nour estimate agrees with the LFs of Pozzetti et al. and of\nFeulner et al. (both based on spectroscopic redshift) while\ndeviates significantly from the LFs of Bolzonella et al. and\nof Dahlen et al. (2005). In particular, both these LFs are\ncharacterized by significantly fainter M\u2217 (0.4 mag with respect to our LF and 0.5-0.6 mag with respect to the LF of\nFeulner et al. and Pozzetti et al.). Also at redshift zm \u223c 1.2\n\n15\n\nour LF agrees very well with the Pozzetti et al. LF while\ndeviates significantly from the LFs of Bolzonella et al. and\nDahlen et al. These latter find also an evolution of M\u2217 in\nthe opposite sense with respect to what we and other authors found, i.e. a dimming from z \u223c 0.4 to z \u223c 0.9. They\nuse eq. 2 to derive the rest-frame absolute magnitudes. They\nsuggest that a negative evolution should be expected in Js\nand at longer wavelengths by extrapolating the results obtained by Ilbert et al. (2005), who find that the evolution\nof M\u2217 is systematically weaker from U to I-bands. Thus, a\nturnover in the evolution of M\u2217 could be expected at \u223cJ and\na negative evolution should take place at longer wavelength.\nThey suggest that the positive evolution which is instead\nobserved by many authors is explained by the method used\nto derive the rest-frame luminosities we discussed in \u00a74: the\nobserved band (Ks or Js) samples shorter rest-frame wavelengths (where the evolution is stronger) at higher redshift\nand the use of eq. 1 to derive the rest-frame luminosities\ncould mimic a brightening in M\u2217 . However, we have shown\nin \u00a74 and \u00a75 that this is not true at least down to z \u223c 2 and\nwe can consequently exclude with certainty that the evolution found by us and by other authors is due to a wrong\nderivation of the rest-frame luminosities.\nThus, from the comparison with the other LFs in Jsband we confirm an evolution in the LF of galaxies from\nzm \u223c 0.6 to zm \u223c 1.2, i.e. a brightening \u2206M \u2217 \u2243 \u22120.4\ncoupled with a decrease of the number density of bright\ngalaxies. This evolutionary trend extends to z \u223c 3 even if,\nas for the Ks-band LF, mid-IR observations would be needed\nto confirm the trend.\n\n7\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have probed the evolution of the rest-frame Js-band and\nKs-band LFs of field galaxies with a complete sample of\nabout 300 galaxies selected in the HDF-S at Ks6 23 (Vega).\nPhotometric redshifts have been obtained from template\nSED fitting to U300 , B450 , V606 , I814 , Js, H and Ks photometry after having calibrated and optimized the procedure\nand the set of templates with a control sample of 232 spectroscopic redshifts, 151 from the HDF-N and 81 from the\nHDF-S. The accuracy in the redshift estimate we obtained\nis 0.06 (rms).\nWe investigate the reliability of the rest-frame nearIR absolute magnitudes obtained using the conventional\nmethod based on the extrapolation of the observed photometry on the best-fitting template and using the photometry\napproaching the rest-frame near-IR. We find that the restframe Js-band absolute magnitudes obtained through the\nphotometry in the redder bands (H and Ks according to the\nredshift of the galaxy) are consistent with those obtained\nfrom the Js-band photometry at least down to z \u223c 2. This\nshows that the LF is not dependent either on the extrapolation made on the best-fitting template or on the library of\nmodels used.\nWe derived the Js-band and the Ks-band LF in the\nthree redshift bins [0,0.8), [0.8,1.9) and [1.9,4) centered at\nthe median redshift zm \u223c 0.6, zm \u223c 1.2 and zm \u223c 3. Each\nbin contains 101, 100 and 84 galaxies of which 52 (50%), 12\n(12%) and 10 (12%) with spectroscopic redshift respectively.\nThe analysis of the observed LF at different redshifts and\n\n\f16\n\nP.

The number of galaxies (439) is the total number of galaxies in the sample.\n\nthe comparison with those previously found by other authors\nat comparable redshift and at z = 0 provided the following\nresults:\n1. We find hints of a raise of the faint end (MJ s > \u221217 and\nMKs > \u221218) of the near-IR LF at zm \u223c 0.6. The raise is\ndefined by 9 galaxies at z < 0.3 with irregular morphology\nas found for the local LF at optical wavelength (e.g. Marzke\net al. 1994; Marzke et al. 1998; Zucca et al. 1997; Folkes\net al. 1999). They account for a comoving number density\nn\u0304 = 0.4 \u00b1 0.23 Mpc\u22123 at < z >\u2243 0.2, almost one order of\nmagnitude higher than that of brighter galaxies. However,\ngiven the low statistics, such raise of the faint end needs a\nlarger sample to be established;\n2. We find no evidence of a steepening with redshift of the\nnear-IR LFs of galaxies in the HDF-S. The value of \u03b1 we find\nis consistent with the local value. Given the size of our sample, we estimate that if \u03b1 changes with redshift its evolution\nis constrained within \u00b10.3 from z \u223c 0 to z \u223c 3.\n3. We do not find evidence of strong evolution of the LF up to\nzm \u2243 0.6, where 50% of our galaxies has spectroscopic redshift. The comparison with the local estimates of the near-IR\nLF (Cole et al. 2001; Kochanek et al. 2001) shows that M\u2217\nhas evolved not more than 0.2-0.3 magnitude in this redshift range, while the number density of galaxies (\u03c6\u2217 ) has\nnot evolved significantly in this redshift range, in agreement\nwith the previous studies (e.g. Drory et al. 2003; Pozzetti et\n\nal. 2003; Feulner et al. 2003; Glazebrook et al. 1995; Caputi\net al. 2004, 2005).\n4. We clearly detect an evolution of the LF at zm > 0.6 characterized by a brightening of M\u2217 of about 0.6 and a decrease\nof \u03c6\u2217 by a factor 2-3 to zm \u223c 1.2 both in the Js-band and in\nthe Ks-band. By fixing \u03b1 = 1.0, this evolution is characterized by \u2206M \u2217 \u2243 \u22120.6 (at 1\u03c3) coupled with \u2206\u03c6\u2217 /\u03c6\u2217 \u2243 \u22120.65\n(at > 3\u03c3). The brightening persists (at 1\u03c3) up to zm \u223c 3\ntogether with the decline of \u03c6\u2217 (at \u223c 2\u03c3) even if at a lower\nextent.\nOur results agrees, at least qualitatively, with most of\nthe analysis previously done (Drory et al. 2003; Pozzetti et\nal. 2003; Feulner et al. 2003; Caputi et al. 2004, 2005) while\ndeviates from the recent estimate of Dahlen et al. (2005).\nTaking into account that the near-IR light is rather tightly\nconnected to the stellar mass, our results can give insights on\nthe evolution of the stellar mass of the galaxies besides their\nluminosity. Up to z \u2243 0.8, clearly little luminosity evolution\nand no density evolution is observed. This suggests that the\npopulation of local bright galaxies was already formed at\nz \u223c 0.8 and that their stellar mass growth was already completed at this redshift. This agrees with the results on the\nevolution of the stellar mass density obtained by many authors: Fontana et al. (2003) and Rudnick et al. (2003) in the\nHDF-S, Fontana et al. (2004) on the K20 sample (Cimatti\net al. 2002), Yamada et al.

In the other panels our estimates are compared with those\nobtained by other authors at comparable redshift: z \u2243 0.5 (middle\npanel), z \u2243 1 (lower panel)\n\nvey Field, Bundy et al. (2005) and Drory et al. (2005) in\nthe GOODS and FDF fields and Feulner et al. (2005a) in\nthe MUNICS fields. Indeed, all of them find very little or\neven no evolution in the stellar mass function of galaxies\nand in the specific star formation rate (SSFR) at z < 1 for\nhigh-mass galaxies.\nAt z > 0.8 the evolution is stronger and the larger\nbrightening observed is accompanied by a decrease of the\nnumber density of bright/massive galaxies. In the redshift\nbin [0.8,1.9) the number density of bright galaxies is \u223c\n30 \u2212 50% of the local value and reaches \u223c 20 \u2212 30% at\n1.9 < z < 4. This decline in the number density suggests\nthat up to 70% of the local massive/bright galaxies has\ngrown at 1 < z < 2 \u2212 3 through star formation, merging\nor both. Thus, we should expect to observe massive starforming galaxies with disturbed/irregular morphology and\nmerging systems in this high redshift range, as indeed found\nin same cases (e.g. Daddi et al. 2004). On the other hand, the\nobserved evolution implies also that at least 30% of the local\nbright/massive galaxies was already in place at 1 < z < 2 as\nindeed found by some authors (Fontana et al. 2004; Glazebrook et al. 2004; F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2004). Pozzetti et\nal. (2003) and Caputi et al. (2005a) show that the bright end\nof the LF is dominated by early-type galaxies and that their\ncontribution to the bright end does not decline with redshift.\n\n17\n\nThus, that 30% should be dominated by early-types implying that we should observe massive evolved galaxies fully\nassembled at 1 < z < 2 and even at z > 2. This is indeed\nobserved by many authors (Cimatti et al. 2004; McCarthy\net al. 2004; Saracco et al. 2004, 2005; Longhetti et al. 2005;\nDaddi et al. 2005; Labb\u00e9 et al. 2005). It is worth noting that\nthis picture could be accounted for, at least qualitatively, in\nthe hierarchical picture of galaxy formation as suggested by\nthe recent results obtained by Nagamine et al. (2005).\nFrom these considerations we can gather that the\ngrowth of massive galaxies does not follow a unique way but\ndisplays different behaviours. A significant fraction (50-70%)\nof the brighetst/most massive galaxies increases their stellar mass over a large redshift range at z > 1. The remaining\nfraction reaches their final mass in a narrower redshift range\nat z > 3 since it is already in place by this redshift. This\nsuggests that, for the former, the stellar mass growth has\nbeen less efficient and has proceeded more slowly than for\nthe latter. On the contrary, in the latter, the stellar mass has\nto be grown rapidly in a short interval, surely much shorter\nthan 1 Gyr given their redshift. This is supported by the\nrecent results derived by mid-IR massive galaxies observed\nat high-z (e.g. Caputi et al. 2005b) and suggests a high efficiency in the accretion of the stellar mass in massive haloes\nin the early Universe, possibly through a very efficient star\nformation. The recent results obtained on the evolution of\nthe SSFR of galaxies seems to point toward this direction.\nThe strong increase in the SSFR of the most massive galaxies\nwith redshift (Feulner et al. 2005b) favors indeed an efficient\nSFR in the brightest galaxies at z > 3 \u2212 4 constraining their\ngrowth in a very short interval.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work is based on observations made with the ESOVLT telescopes at Paranal Observatory under the programs\n164.O-0612 and 70.B-0144 and with the NASA/ESA Hubble\nSpace Telescope.
