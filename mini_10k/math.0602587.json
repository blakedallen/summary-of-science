Rokhlin\nAbstract. For a set-valued stochastic sequence (Gn )N\nn=0 with relatively open convex values\nGn (\u03c9) we give a criterion for the existence of an adapted sequence (xn )N\nn=0 of selectors,\nadmitting an equivalent martingale measure. Mentioned criterion is expressed in terms of\nsupports of the regular conditional upper distributions of the elements Gn . This result is a\nrefinement of the main result of author's previous paper (Teor. Veroyatnost. i Primen., 2005,\n50:3, 480\u2013500), where the sets Gn (\u03c9) were assumed to be open and where were asked if the\nopenness condition can be relaxed.\n\nIntroduction\nLet (\u03a9, F , P) be a probability space endowed with the filtration (Fn )N\nn=0 . Consider a\nd\nsequence of Fn -measurable set-valued maps \u03a9 7\u2192 Gn (\u03c9) \u2282 R , n = 0, . . . , N with the\nnonempty relatively open convex values Gn (\u03c9). In this paper we give a criterion for the\nexistence of a pair, consisting of an adapted single-valued stochastic process x = (xn )N\nn=1 ,\nxn (\u03c9) \u2208 Gn (\u03c9) and a probability measure Q equivalent to P such that x is a martingale\nunder Q. Following [1], we say that the martingale selection problem (m.s.p.) is solvable if\nsuch a pair (x, Q) exists.\nThis problem is motivated by some questions of arbitrage theory. In particular, if the\nmappings Gn are single-valued, then we obtain the well-known problem concerning the\nexistence of an equivalent martingale measure for a given stochastic process Gn = xn .\nIn this case the solvability of the m.s.p. is equivalent to the absence of arbitrage in the\nmarket, where the discounted asset price process is described by x [2\u20135]. It is shown in [4]\nthat an equivalent martingale measure for x exists iff the convex hulls of the supports of\nxn \u2212 xn\u22121 regular conditional distributions with respect to Fn\u22121 contain the origin as a\npoint of relative interior [4, Theorem 3, condition (g)]. The aim of the present paper is to\nrefine this result.\nIn the framework of market models with transaction costs [6\u20138] the role of equivalent\nmartingale measures is played by strictly consistent price processes. This name is assigned\nto P-martingales a.s. taking values in the relative interior of the random cones K \u2217 , conjugate to the solvency cones K. Using the invariance of K under multiplication, it is easy\nto show (see [1, Introduction]) that the existence of a strictly consistent price process is\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 60G42.\nKey words and phrases.

This result is not completely satisfactory since,\nfor instance, it does not include the case of single-valued Gn and it does not allow the\ncones Kn\u2217 to have the empty interior. The last limitation means that the \"efficient friction\"\ncondition must be satisfied (according to the terminology of [6]).\nIn the present paper we refine the main result of [1] (see Theorem 1). Moreover, the\nproof given below, as compared to [1], is considerably simplified.\n2. Preliminaries\nConsider a probability space (\u03a9, F , P) and a \u03c3-algebra H \u2282 F . In the sequel we assume\nthat all \u03c3-algebras are complete with respect to P (i.e. they contain all the subsets of\ntheir P-negligible sets). Denote by cl A, ri A, conv A the closure, the relative interior, and\nthe convex hull of a subset A of a finite-dimensional space. Let B = B(Rd ) be the Borel\n\u03c3-algebra of Rd .\nA set-valued map F , assigning some set F (\u03c9) \u2282 Rd to each \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9, is called H-measurable\nif {\u03c9 : F (\u03c9) \u2229 V 6= \u2205} \u2208 H for any open set V \u2282 Rd . The graph and the domain of F are\ndefined by\ngr F = {(\u03c9, x) : x \u2208 F (\u03c9)}, dom F = {\u03c9 : F (\u03c9) 6= \u2205}.\nIf gr F \u2208 H \u2297 B, then the mapping F is H-measurable [9, Corollary II.1.34].\nThe function f : \u03a9 7\u2192 Rd is called a selector of a set-valued map F if f (\u03c9) \u2208 F (\u03c9) for\nall \u03c9 \u2208 dom F . Denote by S(F, H) the set of H-measurable selectors of F . Note, that if\nthe set-valued map F is H-measurable, then the mapping\nF\u2217 = F Idom F + Rd I\u03a9\\ dom F\n\n(1)\n\nis also H-measurable and S(F, H) = S(F\u2217 , H). Here IA (\u03c9) = 1, \u03c9 \u2208 A; IA (\u03c9) = 0, \u03c9 6\u2208 A.\nThe countable family {fi }\u221e\ni=1 of an H-measurable selectors is called (an H-measurable)\nCastaing representation for F , if the sets {fi (\u03c9)}\u221e\ni=1 are dense in F (\u03c9) for all \u03c9 \u2208 dom F .\nThe set-valued map F with nonempty closed values is H-measurable iff it admits an Hmeasurable Castaing representation [9, Proposition II.2.3].\nAn element f \u2208 S(conv F, H) is said to have an H-measurable Caratheodory representation, if there are some elements gk \u2208 S(F, H), k = 1, . . . , d + 1 and H-measurable functions\n\u03b1k \u2265 0, k = 1, . . . , d + 1;\n\nd+1\nX\n\n\u03b1k = 1\n\n(2)\n\nk=1\n\nPd+1\nsuch that f =\nk=1 \u03b1k gk a.s. Under the assumption gr F \u2208 H \u2297 B any element f \u2208\nS(conv F, H) has an H-measurable Caratheodory representation [10, Theorem 8.2(iii)].\nDenote by CL = CL(Rd ) the family of nonempty closed subsets of Rd and let E(CL) be\nthe Effros \u03c3-algebra, generated by the sets of the form\nAV = {D \u2208 CL : D \u2229 V 6= \u2205},\n\n\fMARTINGALE SELECTION THEOREM\n\n3\n\nwhere V is an open subset of Rd .\nSuppose F is an F -measurable set-valued map with nonempty closed values. It follows directly from the definitions that the corresponding single-valued map F : (\u03a9, F ) 7\u2192\n(CL, E(CL)) is measurable. The measurable space (CL, E(CL)) is a Borel space ([11, Theorem 3.3.10]). Consequently, the map F , considered as a random element taking values in\n(CL, E(CL)), has the regular conditional distribution with respect to H [12, Chapter II, \u00a77,\nTheorem 5].\nThus, there exists a function P\u2217 : \u03a9 \u00d7 E(CL) 7\u2192 [0, 1] with the following properties:\n(i) for every \u03c9 the function C 7\u2192 P\u2217 (\u03c9, C) is a probability measure on E(CL);\n(ii) for every C \u2208 E(CL) the function \u03c9 7\u2192 P\u2217 (\u03c9, C) a.s. coincides with the conditional\nprobability P({F \u2208 C}|H)(\u03c9).\nFollowing [1], we define the regular conditional upper distribution of the mapping F with\nrespect to H by the formula \u03bcF,H (\u03c9, V ) = P\u2217 (\u03c9, AV ) for any open subset V \u2282 Rd . The set\n\b\nK(F, H; \u03c9) = y \u2208 Rd : \u03bcF,H (\u03c9, {y \u2032 : |y \u2032 \u2212 y| < \u03b5}) > 0 for all \u03b5 > 0\n\nis called the support of \u03bcF,H (\u03c9, *) [1]. Note, that if F is a single-valued map, then \u03bcF,H\nis its regular conditional distribution with respect to H and K(F, H) is the support of the\nmeasure \u03bcF,H .\nThe set-valued map \u03c9 7\u2192 K(F, H; \u03c9) has nonempty closed values and is H-measurable\n[1, Proposition 4(a)]. Let {fi }\u221e\ni=1 be an F -measurable Castaing representation for F . Then\nthe following equality holds true (see [1, Lemma 1]):\nK(F, H) = cl\n\n\u221e\n[\n\nK(fi , H)\n\ni=1\n\n!\n\na.s.\n\n(3)\n\nIf the values of F are empty on a P-null set, then we put K(F, H) = K(F\u2217 , H), where\nF\u2217 is defined by (1). Evidently, equaility (3) still holds true in this case.\nProvided F (\u03c9) = \u2205 on a set of positive measure, we put K(F, H) = \u2205 for all \u03c9.\n3. Main result\nSuppose \u03a9 7\u2192 Gn (\u03c9) \u2282 Rd , n = 0, 1, . . . , N is a sequence of Fn -measurable set-valued\nmaps with nonempty relatively open convex values Gn (\u03c9). Define the sequence (Wn )N\nn=0\nof set-valued maps recursively by\nWN = cl GN ,\nWn\u22121 = cl(Gn\u22121 \u2229 ri Yn\u22121 ),\n\nYn\u22121 = conv K(Wn , Fn\u22121 ),\n\n1 \u2264 n \u2264 N.\n\nThis sequence is well-defined and is adapted to the filtration. Indeed, suppose the map\nWn is Fn -measurable. If Wn 6= \u2205 a.s., then the map conv K(Wn , Fn\u22121 ) is Fn\u22121 -measurable\n(see [1, Proposition 4(a)] and [9, Proposition II.2.26]). Furthermore, the graphs of the\nmaps Gn\u22121 , ri Yn\u22121 are measurable with respect to the \u03c3-algebra Fn\u22121 \u2297 B [13, Lemma\n1(c)]. Consequently, the map Gn\u22121 \u2229 ri Yn\u22121 is Fn\u22121 -measurable [9, Corollary II.1.34]. Its\nclosure Wn\u22121 has the same property [9, Proposition II.1.8].\nProvided Wn = \u2205 on a set of positive measure, we have Wn\u22121 = \u2205 by the definition.\n\n\f4\n\nDMITRY B. ROKHLIN\n\nTheorem 1. The following conditions are equivalent:\nN\n(a) there exist an adapted to the filtration (Fn )N\nn=0 stochastic process x = (xn )n=0 and\nan equivalent to P probability measure Q such that xn \u2208 S(Gn , Fn ), n \u2265 0 and x\nis a Q-martingale;\n(b) Wn 6= \u2205 a.s., n = 0, . . . , N \u2212 1.\nDenote by E(f |H) the generalized conditional expectation of the F -measurable random\nvariable f with respect to H (under the measure P) [12, p.229], [5, p.117]. The proof of\nTheorem 1 is based on the following result.\nLemma 1. Let F be an F -measurable set-valued mapping with nonempty closed convex\nvalues. For any H-measurable selector \u03be of the map ri(conv K(F, H)) there exist an element\n\u03b7 \u2208 S(ri F, F ) and an F -measurable random variable \u03b3 > 0 such that\n\u03be = E(\u03b3\u03b7|H), E(\u03b3|H) = 1 a.s.\n\n(4)\n\nProof. Let {fi }\u221e\ni=1 , fi \u2208 S(ri F, F ) be a Castaing representation for ri F . Since ri F \u2208 F \u2297B\n([13, Lemma 1(c)]), such a representation exists (see [9, Proposition II.2.17]).\nEvidently, {fi }\u221e\ni=1 is also a Castaing representation for F . Applying (3) we get\n!!!\n\u221e\n[\n\u03be \u2208 ri(conv K(F, H)) = ri conv cl\nK(fi , H)\na.s.\ni=1\n\nd\nNote that for any collection of sets {Ai }\u221e\ni=1 , Ai \u2282 R the following inclusion holds true\n!!!\n!\n\u221e\n\u221e\n[\n[\nB1 = ri conv cl\nAi\n\u2282 conv\nri (conv Ai ) = B2 .\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nIndeed, suppose x 6\u2208 B2 .

The proof of Lemma 1 is complete.\n\n\f6\n\nDMITRY B. ROKHLIN\n\nProof of Theorem 1. Assume that condition (b) is satisfied. Starting from an arbitrary\nselector x0 \u2208 S(ri W0 , F0 ) let us construct adapted sequences xn \u2208 ri Wn , \u03b3n > 0, meeting\nthe conditions\nxn\u22121 = E(\u03b3n xn |Fn ), E(\u03b3n |Fn\u22121 ) = 1 a.s., n = 1, . . . , N.\nThe existence of the selector x0 is implied by already mentioned results [13, Lemma 1(c)],\n[9, Proposition II.2.17]. The existence of the above sequences follows from Lemma 1, since\nxn\u22121 \u2208 S(ri Wn\u22121 , Fn\u22121 ) imply that xn\u22121 \u2208 S(ri(conv K(Wn , Fn\u22121 )), Fn\u22121 ).\nConsider the positive P-martingale\n(zn )N\nn=0 , z0 = 1, zn =\n\nn\nY\n\n\u03b3k , n \u2265 1\n\nk=1\n\nand the equivalent to P probability measure Q\u2032 with the density dQ\u2032 /dP = zN . According\nto the generalized Bayes formula we have\nxn\u22121 =\n\n1\nzn\u22121\n\nE(xn zn |Fn\u22121 ) = EQ\u2032 (xn |Fn\u22121 ) a.s.\n\nThus, the process x is a generalized (or, equivalently, a local) Q\u2032 -martingale and it admits\nan equivalent martingale measure Q ([4, Theorem 3]).\nAs long as, moreover, xn \u2208 S(ri Wn , Fn ) \u2282 S(Gn , Fn ), condition (a) is verified.\nNow assume that condition (a) is satisfied. Note that xN \u2208 GN \u2282 WN . Suppose the\nrelations xj \u2208 Wj , j \u2265 n are already established. Since\n0 \u2208 ri(conv K(xn \u2212 xn\u22121 , Fn\u22121 )) a.s., n \u2265 1\n(see [4, Theorem 3]) and K(xn , Fn\u22121 ) \u2282 K(Wn , Fn\u22121 ), it follows that\nxn\u22121 \u2208 Gn\u22121 \u2229 ri(conv K(xn , Fn\u22121 )) \u2282 Gn\u22121 \u2229 ri Yn\u22121 \u2282 Wn\u22121 a.s.\nParticulary, Wn 6= \u2205 a.s. for all n. The proof is complete.\nIn the paper [1] Theorem 1 was proved under one of the following additional assumptions:\n(i) the sets Gn (\u03c9) are open; (ii) the set \u03a9 is finite.\nReferences\n1.
