Introduction. How many steps does it take for a deck of n cards to achieve nearrandomness if, at each step, two randomly chosen cards are transposed? This question was\nanswered by Diaconis and Shahshahani (1981). Now suppose that at each step, the two cards\nare not only transposed, but also possibly flipped. Suppose that, instead of n cards, there\nare n wheels and that, at each step, two wheels are transposed and then spun. Or suppose\nthat, instead of n wheels, there are n decks of cards and that, at each step, two decks are\ntransposed and then shuffled. How many steps does it take for these processes to achieve\nnear-randomness?\nOr perhaps we are interested in a process that is (at least somewhat) similar in form to\none of those described above. Can we determine how many steps are needed for it to achieve\nnear-randomness? These are the types of questions that we consider.\nFor a certain random walk on the symmetric group Sn that is generated by random transpositions, Diaconis and Shahshahani (1981) obtained bounds on the rate of convergence to\nuniformity using group representation theory. Similarly, we bound the rate of convergence\nto uniformity for a random walk on the complete monomial group G \u2240 Sn that is generated by random transpositions, followed by independent randomizations of the transposed\nelements. Specifically, we determine that 12 n log n + 14 n log(|G| \u2212 1|) steps are both necessary\nand sufficient for l2 distance to become small. We also determine that 21 n log n steps are both\nnecessary and sufficient for total variation distance to become small. These results provide\nAMS 1991 subject classifications.

SCHOOLFIELD, JR.\n\nrates of convergence for random walks on a number of groups of interest: the hyperoctahedral\ngroup Z2 \u2240 Sn , the generalized symmetric group Zm \u2240 Sn , and Sm \u2240 Sn . In the special case\nof the hyperoctahedral group, the two rates of convergence are the same in both metrics. We\nalso examine a slight variant of this random walk, establishing upper and lower bounds on\nits rate of convergence to uniformity.\nThe comparison technique was introduced by Diaconis and Saloff-Coste (1993) as a method\nfor bounding the rate of convergence to uniformity of a symmetric random walk on a finite\ngroup by comparing it to a benchmark random walk whose rate of convergence is known.\nOur random walks on the hyperoctahedral, generalized symmetric, and complete monomial\ngroups provide such benchmarks to which many other random walks, modeling a wide range\nof phenomena, may be compared, thereby yielding bounds on the rates of convergence to\nuniformity for previously intractable random walks. Schoolfield (1998) used the results of this\npaper to analyze two specific examples using this technique, one of which has applications\nin mathematical biology. Schoolfield (1998) further specialized the comparison technique to\nrandom walks generated by random transpositions along the edges of a graph and analyzed\nseveral examples.\nSection 2 presents the basic properties and results from group theory and representation\ntheory necessary to analyze random walks on groups. Section 3 extends the idea of random\ntranspositions of n cards, analyzed in Section 2, to a set of n decks of m cards each and\nbeyond.\n\n2. Groups, Representations, and Random Walks.\n\n2.1. Introduction. Imagine n cards, labeled 1 through n, on a table in sequential order.\nIndependently choose two integers p and q uniformly from {1, 2, . . . , n}. If p 6= q, transpose\nthe cards in positions p and q; we denote this by \u03c4 \u2208 Sn , where \u03c4 is the transposition (p q).\nWe shall refer to this procedure as a random transposition of n cards. If p = q (which occurs\nwith probability 1/n), leave the cards in their current positions. This action is of course the\nidentity permutation, which is denoted by e \u2208 Sn .\nIf this process is repeated many times, the cards will appear to be in uniformly random\norder, that is, will appear to be the result of a random permutation. This process may be\nmodeled formally using a probability measure P (which we shall regard as a probability mass\n\n\f3\n\nRANDOM WALKS ON WREATH PRODUCTS OF GROUPS\n\nfunction) on the symmetric group Sn , namely,\n1\nwhere e is the identity element,\nP (e) :=\nn\n2\nP (\u03c4 ) := 2 where \u03c4 is any transposition,\nn\n\n(2.1.1)\n\nP (\u03c0) := 0 otherwise.\nRepeating the process above k times is modeled as the convolution P \u2217k of the measure P\nwith itself k times. Since there are n! elements in Sn , the uniform probability measure on\nthe set of all permutations of Sn is given by\n1\nfor every \u03c0 \u2208 Sn .\n(2.1.2)\nU(\u03c0) :=\nn!\nThe following result, which is Theorem 1 of Diaconis and Shahshahani (1981) and was later\nincluded in Diaconis (1988) as Theorem 5 in Section D of Chapter 3, establishes an upper\nbound on both the total variation distance and the l2 distance (both defined in Section 2.6)\nbetween P \u2217k and U.\nTheorem 2.1.3.\n\nLet P and U be the probability measures on the symmetric group Sn\n\ndefined in (2.1.1) and (2.1.2), respectively.

In Section 2.2 we present basic\ndefinitions from group theory. In Section 2.3 we present basic results from the theory of group\nrepresentations, while Section 2.4 concentrates on the characters of these representations. In\nSection 2.5 we introduce the Fourier transform, and we show how it may be used to bound\nthe distance to uniformity of a random walk on a group in Section 2.6. In Section 2.7 we\nshow how the results from these previous sections were applied to the random walk on the\nsymmetric group defined above, proving Theorem 2.1.3 and a matching lower bound.\n2.2. Group Theory. We now present basic definitions from the theory of groups which\nwill be needed to conduct our analysis. A more detailed introduction to this subject may be\nfound in Chapter 1 of Alperin and Bell (1995).\nA group is a non-empty set G with a binary operation on G, usually called multiplication,\nwhich satisfies the following three axioms: (i) Multiplication is associative, (ii) There is a\nunique identity element e \u2208 G, and (iii) For every g \u2208 G there is a unique inverse element\n\n\f4\n\nC.H. SCHOOLFIELD, JR.\n\ng \u22121 \u2208 G such that gg \u22121 = e = g \u22121 g. The number of elements of a finite group G is called\nthe order of G and is denoted by |G|.\nA subset H of a group G is called a subgroup of G if it forms a group under the multiplication of G restricted to H. A subgroup N of G is called a normal subgroup of G if gNg \u22121 \u2286 N\nfor all g \u2208 G, where gNg \u22121 := {gng \u22121 \u2208 G : n \u2208 N}. If gh = hg for all g, h \u2208 G, then\nG is called an abelian group. Notice that every subgroup of an abelian group is a normal\nsubgroup.\nThe set kH := {kh \u2208 G : h \u2208 H}, where k \u2208 G and H is a subgroup of G, is called\na left coset of H in G. (Right cosets are defined analogously.) The set of all left cosets\nof H in G is called the left coset space and is denoted by G/H. If |G/H| = n, a set of left\ncoset representatives {k1 , k2 , . . . , kn } may be chosen so that the left cosets k1 H, k2 H, . . . , kn H\ncomprise precisely the coset space G/H. If N is a normal subgroup of G, then G/N is also\na group known as the quotient group.\nOne group of interest to us is the cyclic group Zn , which is the set {0, 1, 2, . . . , n \u2212 1}\nunder the operation of addition mod n. Notice that Zn is abelian and that |Zn | = n. Another\ngroup of interest to us is the symmetric group Sn , which is the set of all permutations of\n{1, 2, . . . , n} under the operation of composition of functions (where we compose functions\nfrom right to left). Notice that Sn is not abelian for any n \u2265 3, and that |Sn | = n!.\nTwo elements g and h of G are called conjugate if there exists some k \u2208 G such that\nh = kgk \u22121 . The set of elements conjugate to a particular element g \u2208 G form the conjugacy\nclass of g. Conjugacy is an equivalence relation and partitions a group G into disjoint subsets,\nnamely, the conjugacy classes.\nThe set of ordered pairs of elements of groups G1 and G2 with multiplication defined\ncomponentwise is called the direct product of G1 and G2 and is denoted by G1 \u00d7 G2 . The\ngroup of elements (g1 , g2 , . . . , gn ; \u03c0) \u2208 Gn \u00d7 Sn , with multiplication defined by\n(h1 , . . . , hn ; \u03c3) * (g1 , . . . , gn ; \u03c0) = (h1 * g\u03c3\u22121 (1) , . . . , hn * g\u03c3\u22121 (n) ; \u03c3\u03c0),\nis called the wreath product of G with Sn and is denoted G \u2240 Sn . The identity element\n\u22121\n\u22121\n; \u03c0 \u22121 ).\n, . . . , g\u03c0(n)\nof G \u2240 Sn is (e, . . . , e; e), and in G \u2240 Sn we have (g1 , . . . , gn ; \u03c0)\u22121 = (g\u03c0(1)\nThis definition is equivalent to saying that G \u2240 Sn is the semidirect product of Gn with Sn ,\n\nwhere the action of Sn on Gn is \u03c0(g1 , g2 , . . . , gn ) = (g\u03c0\u22121 (1) , g\u03c0\u22121 (2) , . . . , g\u03c0\u22121 (n) ). For a general\ndefinition of semidirect product see Alperin and Bell (1995) or Simon (1996). Three special\ncases of particular interest to us are the hyperoctahedral group Z2 \u2240 Sn , the generalized\nsymmetric group Zm \u2240 Sn , and Sm \u2240 Sn .\n\n\fRANDOM WALKS ON WREATH PRODUCTS OF GROUPS\n\n5\n\n2.3. Representation Theory. We now present basic properties and results from the\nrepresentation theory of groups which will be needed to conduct our analysis. A more detailed\nintroduction to this subject may be found in Chapters 1 through 3 of Serre (1977) or in\nChapter 2 of Diaconis (1988). Other sources include Alperin and Bell (1995) and Simon\n(1996).\nSuppose that V is a finite-dimensional vector space over the complex numbers. The general\nlinear group GL(V ) is the group of isomorphisms of V onto itself. An element of GL(V ) is\na linear mapping of V onto V . Such a map has an inverse which is also linear.\nA representation of a finite group G in V is a homomorphism \u03c1 : G \u2212\u2192 GL(V ). The choice\nof a basis for V assigns an invertible matrix \u03c1(g) to each g \u2208 G. There exists \u03c1(g) \u2208 GL(V )\nfor each g \u2208 G such that \u03c1(g1 g2 ) = \u03c1(g1 )\u03c1(g2 ) for all g1 , g2 \u2208 G. This implies that \u03c1(e) = I\nand that \u03c1(g \u22121 ) = \u03c1(g)\u22121 .\nTwo representations of G, say \u03c11 in V1 and \u03c12 in V2 , are said to be isomorphic (or equivalent) if there exists a linear isomorphism \u03bc : V1 \u2212\u2192 V2 such that \u03bc \u25e6 \u03c11 (g) = \u03c12 (g) \u25e6 \u03bc\nfor all g \u2208 G. The dimension (or degree) of \u03c1 is defined to be the dimension of V and is\ndenoted by d\u03c1 . Since we shall be interested in representations only up to equivalence, we may\nwithout loss of generality assume that V = Cn when d\u03c1 = n. The trivial representation is\nthe one-dimensional representation with V = C that sends every element of G to 1.\nA vector subspace W \u2286 V is stable under G if \u03c1(g)w \u2208 W for all w \u2208 W and all g \u2208 G.\nIf W \u2286 V is stable under G, then \u03c1 restricted to GL(W ) gives a subrepresentation of \u03c1. A\nrepresentation \u03c1 is irreducible if the only vector subspaces of V which are stable under G are V\nitself and the trivial subspace. An important relationship between irreducible representations\nand conjugacy classes is given by the following, which is Theorem 7 in Section 2.5 of Serre\n(1977).\nProposition 2.3.1. The number of nonisomorphic irreducible representations of G\nequals the number of conjugacy classes of G.\nAn important relationship between the dimensions of the irreducible representations of\nG and the order of G is given by the following, which is Corollary 2(a) of Proposition 5 in\nSection 2.4 of Serre (1977).\nLemma 2.3.2.

A more detailed introduction to this subject may be found in Chapter 3 of\nDiaconis (1988).\nSuppose that P is a probability measure defined on a group G. Let \u03be1 , \u03be2, . . . be a sequence\nof independent G-valued random variables each distributed according to P . A random walk\non G is a sequence X = (X0 , X1 , X2 , . . .) defined by X0 := e \u2208 G and Xn := \u03ben \u03ben\u22121 * * * \u03be1 for\nall n \u2265 1. Notice that X is a Markov chain with state space G:\nP{Xn = gn | X0 = e, X1 = g1 , . . . , Xn\u22121 = gn\u22121 }\n= P{\u03ben \u03ben\u22121 * * * \u03be1 = gn | \u03be1 = g1 , . . . , \u03ben\u22121 * * * \u03be1 = gn\u22121 }\n\u22121\n\u22121\n)\n} = P (gn gn\u22121\n= P{\u03ben = gn gn\u22121\n\nfor all n \u2265 1 and all g1 , . . . , gn \u2208 G. In this way a probability measure P on G induces a\ntransition matrix P, where the entry of P at the intersection of the row corresponding to\ng \u2208 G and the column corresponding to h \u2208 G is given by\nPgh = P (hg \u22121).\nIn the special case where P is a class function, we may determine all the eigenvalues of\nthe transition matrix P, together with their multiplicities, by use of the following, which is\nCorollary 3 of Diaconis and Shahshahani (1981).\nLemma 2.6.1. Suppose P is a probability measure defined on a finite group G and that\nP is a class function. Let P be the transition matrix of the Markov chain induced by the\nprobability measure P . Then, for each irreducible representation \u03c1 of G, there is an eigenvalue\n\u03c0\u03c1 of P occurring with algebraic multiplicity d2\u03c1 such that\n\n\fRANDOM WALKS ON WREATH PRODUCTS OF GROUPS\n\n11\n\ns\n\n\u03c0\u03c1 =\n\n1 X\nPi ni \u03c7i ,\nd\u03c1 i=1\n\nwhere the sum is taken over distinct conjugacy classes.\n\nNotice that \u03c0\u03c1 * I in the lemma above is exactly the value of Pb(\u03c1) in Lemma 2.5.1.\n\nIn order to discuss the convergence of these random walks to their stationary distributions,\nwe need a metric between probability measures. Suppose that P and Q are two probability\nmeasures defined on a finite group G. The total variation distance between P and Q is defined\nby\nkP \u2212 QkTV := max |P (A) \u2212 Q(A)|,\nA\u2286G\n\nwhile the l1 distance between P and Q is defined by\nX\nkP \u2212 Qk1 :=\n|P (g) \u2212 Q(g)|.\ng\u2208G\n\n1\nkP\n2\n\n\u2212 Qk1 .

SCHOOLFIELD, JR.\n\n2.7. Random Walk on the Symmetric Group. We now return to the random walk\non the symmetric group defined in Section 2.1 and the proof of Theorem 2.1.3. We include\nonly those portions of the proof that will be needed to conduct our analysis in later sections.\nA detailed introduction to the symmetric group and its representation theory may be found\nin Chapters 1 and 2 of James and Kerber (1981). Another source is Sagan (1991).\nFor any \u03c0 \u2208 Sn , there is an associated n-dimensional vector a = (a1 , a2 , . . . , an ), called\nthe cycle type of \u03c0, where ai is the numbers of cycle factors of \u03c0 of length i for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n.\nAccording to Lemma 1.2.6 of James and Kerber (1981), two elements of Sn are conjugate\nif and only if their cycle types are identical; hence, there is a one-to-one correspondence\nbetween these cycle type vectors and conjugacy classes of Sn . Thus, since the transpositions\nin Sn form their own conjugacy class, the probability measure P defined in (2.1.1) is a class\nfunction.\nA vector [\u03bb] = [\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , . . . , \u03bbk ] such that \u03bb1 \u2265 \u03bb2 \u2265 * * * \u2265 \u03bbk > 0 and \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 + * * * + \u03bbk = n\nis called a partition of n. According to Theorem 2.1.11 of James and Kerber (1981), there\nis a one-to-one correspondence between nonisomorphic irreducible representations of Sn and\npartitions [\u03bb] of n. Thus we have identified all of the irreducible representations of Sn , over\nwhich the summation is taken in the Upper Bound Lemma (2.6.2).\nLemmas 2.5.1 and 2.4.1(a) are then used to calculate the Fourier transform of an irreducible\nrepresentation \u03c1[\u03bb] of Sn , which is\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1 n\u22121\nb\n+\nr(\u03bb) I,\nP (\u03bb) =\nn\nn\n\nwhere r(\u03bb) := \u03c7[\u03bb] (\u03c4 )/d[\u03bb] , \u03c7[\u03bb] (\u03c4 ) is the character of \u03c1[\u03bb] at any transposition \u03c4 , d[\u03bb] is the\ndimension of \u03c1[\u03bb] , and I is the d[\u03bb] -dimensional identity matrix.\nIt then follows from the Upper Bound Lemma (2.6.2) that\nkP\n\n\u2217k\n\n\u2212\n\nUk2TV\n\n\u2264\n\n1\nn!kP \u2217k\n4\n\n\u2212\n\nUk22\n\n=\n\n1\n4\n\nX\n[\u03bb]\n\nd2[\u03bb]\n\n\u0014\n\n1 n\u22121\n+\nr(\u03bb)\nn\nn\n\n\u00152k\n\nwhere the term not to be included in the summation occurs when [\u03bb] = [n], which corresponds\nto the trivial representation of Sn .\nThe following formulas, found is Section D of Chapter 3 and Section B of Chapter 7,\nrespectively, of Diaconis (1988) are used to calculate the numerical value of the Fourier\ntransform.\nLemma 2.7.1.

For further discussion of the cutoff\nphenomenon see Diaconis (1988).\n\n\f16\n\nC.H. SCHOOLFIELD, JR.\n\n3. Random Walk on the Complete Monomial Groups.\n3.1. Introduction. We now extend the idea of random transpositions of n cards, introduced in Section 2.1, to a set of n decks of m cards each and beyond. Imagine n decks of\ncards, labeled 1 through n, in sequential order, each with its m cards in sequential order.\nIndependently choose two integers p and q, uniformly from {1, 2, . . . , n}.\nIf p 6= q, transpose the decks in positions p and q. Then, independently of the choice of\n1\n1\n= m!\neach), permute the deck terminating\np and q and uniformly (i.e., with probability |G|\nin position p by a permutation in G = Sm ; and independently, also uniformly, permute\nthe deck terminating in position q. This procedure is denoted by (~v ; \u03c4 ), where \u03c4 \u2208 Sn is the\nn\ntransposition (p q) and the only possible non-identity entries of ~v \u2208 Gn = Sm\nare in positions\np and q. The element of ~v in position p (resp., q) is \u03c0 \u2208 G = Sm if the deck terminating in\n\nposition p (resp., q) is permuted by \u03c0 \u2208 G = Sm .\nIf p = q (which occurs with probability 1/n), leave the decks in their current positions.\nThen, again independently and uniformly, permute the deck in position p = q by a permutation in G = Sm . If the order of the deck is changed, this action is denoted by (~u; e), where\nn\ne \u2208 Sn is the identity permutation and the only non-identity entry of ~u \u2208 Gn = Sm\nis in\nposition p = q. If the order of the deck is not changed, then this action is of course the\nidentity, which is denoted by (~e; e).\n\nIf this process is repeated many times, the decks will appear to be in random order, and\neach deck will appear to be randomly permuted.\nThe specific example above was for motivational purposes only. In this section we will\nactually examine a random walk on G \u2240 Sn for any group G, not just the symmetric group\nSm . In this more general setting, the example above is equivalent to beginning with a vector\n(e, . . . , e) \u2208 Gn , where each e \u2208 G is the identity element. Two elements of this vector are\nthen transposed as the decks of cards were above. The transposed elements of this vector are\nthen multiplied by elements of G as the individual decks were permuted above.\nWe refer to the process on G \u2240 Sn described above as the independent shuffles random\nwalk, retaining use of the word \"shuffles\" even when G is not necessarily Sm . A similar\nprocess, known as the paired shuffles random walk, will be introduced in Section 3.7.\nIn the special case of the generalized symmetric group Zm \u2240 Sn , imagine n wheels, each of\nwhich may stop at one of m values. The process described above randomly transposes two\nof the n wheels and then independently spins the transposed wheels. We thus refer to the\nprocess in this case as the independent spins random walk.\n\n\fRANDOM WALKS ON WREATH PRODUCTS OF GROUPS\n\n17\n\nIn the special case of the hyperoctahedral group Z2 \u2240 Sn , imagine n cards, each with an\norientation (up or down). The process described above randomly transposes two of the n\ncards and then independently flips the transposed cards. We thus refer to the process in this\ncase as the independent flips random walk. Schoolfield (1998) used the comparison technique\nto analyze two random walks by comparing them to the independent flips random walk.\nThe independent shuffles random walk may be modeled formally by a probability measure\n\u0001\nP on the complete monomial group G \u2240 Sn . Since there are n2 transpositions of n elements,\n\u0001\nthen there are |G|2 * n2 = 12 |G|2 n(n \u2212 1) elements of the form (~v ; \u03c4 ). There are also n(|G| \u2212 1)\n\nelements of the form (~u; e) with ~u 6= ~e. We may thus define the following probability measure\non the set of all elements of G \u2240 Sn :\n1\n,\nP (~e; e) =\n|G|n\n1\nP (~u; e) =\nwhere ~u 6= ~e \u2208 Gn ,\n|G|n2\n(3.1.1)\n2\nwhere ~v \u2208 Gn ,\nP (~v; \u03c4 ) =\n|G|2 n2\nP (~x; \u03c0) = 0\n\notherwise,\n\nwhere there is only one non-identity entry of ~u \u2208 Gn , and where if \u03c4 \u2208 Sn is the transposition\n(p q) then the only possible non-identity entries of ~v \u2208 Gn are in positions p and q. In the\nspecial case of the hyperoctahedral group Z2 \u2240 Sn , we refer to the elements (~u; e) as signed\nidentities and the elements (~v; \u03c4 ) as signed transpositions.\nSince there are |G|n * n! elements in G \u2240 Sn , the uniform probability measure is given by\n1\nfor (~x; \u03c0) \u2208 G \u2240 Sn .\n(3.1.2)\nU(~x; \u03c0) =\nn\n|G| * n!\nThe following result establishes an upper bound on both the total variation distance and\nthe l2 distance between P \u2217k and U. We establish an analogous result for the paired shuffles\nrandom walk as Theorem 3.7.3.\nTheorem 3.1.3.\n\nLet P and U be the probability measures on the complete monomial\n\ngroup G \u2240 Sn defined in (3.1.1) and (3.1.2), respectively. Let k = 12 n log n+ 41 n log(|G|\u22121)+cn.\nThen there exists a universal constant b > 0 such that\nkP \u2217k \u2212 UkTV \u2264\n\n1\n2\n\n(|G|n n!)1/2 kP \u2217k \u2212 Uk2 \u2264 be\u22122c\n\nfor all c > 0.\n\nIn the following sections we establish the results necessary to prove this theorem and an\nanalogous theorem for the paired shuffles random walk. In Section 3.2 we study the basic\n\n\f18\n\nC.H. SCHOOLFIELD, JR.\n\nproperties of the complete monomial groups. In Section 3.3 we show that the probability\nmeasure defined above is constant on conjugacy classes. In Section 3.4 we identify all of the\nirreducible representations of the complete monomial groups and in Section 3.5 we calculate\nthe characters of these irreducible representations. In Section 3.6 we calculate the Fourier\ntransform of the probability measure defined in (3.1.1) and prove Theorem 3.1.3 along with\na matching l2 lower bound. In Section 3.7 we perform a similar analysis of the paired shuffles\nrandom walk; however, the results are quite different in the case that G is nonabelian.\n3.2. The Complete Monomial Groups. The complete monomial group G \u2240 Sn is\nthe wreath product of the group G with the symmetric group Sn . Special cases include the\nhyperoctahedral group Z2 \u2240 Sn , the generalized symmetric group Zm \u2240 Sn , and Sm \u2240 Sn . The\nelements of G \u2240 Sn may be represented as (~x; \u03c0) \u2208 Gn \u00d7 Sn . It then follows that the order\nof the complete monomial group is |G \u2240 Sn | = |G|n * n!.\nEach element (~x; \u03c0) \u2208 G \u2240 Sn acts on a vector w\n~ \u2208 Gn by first permuting its elements\naccording to the permutation \u03c0 and then left-multiplying the elements of the permuted vector\nby the elements of ~x, entry by entry; i.e., for any (~x; \u03c0) \u2208 G \u2240 Sn and any w\n~ \u2208 Gn ,\n\u0001\n(~x; \u03c0)(w)\n~ = x1 * w\u03c0\u22121 (1) , . . . , xn * w\u03c0\u22121 (n) \u2208 Gn .\n\nIn keeping with the decks of cards analogy, each element (~x; \u03c0) \u2208 Sm \u2240 Sn first permutes\nthe n decks of cards according to \u03c0 and then permutes each deck of cards according to the\nentry of ~x at its new index.\nConsidering the actions, described above, of the elements of the complete monomial group\non vectors in Gn , it follows that the product of two elements (~x; \u03c0), (~y ; \u03c3) \u2208 G \u2240 Sn is given\nby\n\u0001\n(~y ; \u03c3) * (~x; \u03c0) = y1 * x\u03c3\u22121 (1) , . . . , yn * x\u03c3\u22121 (n) ; \u03c3\u03c0 .\n\nThus the identity element is (e, . . . , e; e) where (e, . . . , e) \u2208 Gn and e is the identity permutation in Sn . It also follows that the inverse of any element (~x; \u03c0) \u2208 G \u2240 Sn is\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u22121\n\u22121\n(~x; \u03c0)\u22121 = x\u22121\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\nx\n;\n\u03c0\n.\n\u03c0(1)\n\u03c0(n)\nThere are two very important subgroups of G \u2240 Sn which should be considered. The\n\nsubgroup consisting of elements of the form {(~x; e) : ~x \u2208 Gn } is isomorphic to Gn and is a\nnormal subgroup of G \u2240 Sn . The subgroup consisting of elements of the form {(e, . . . , e; \u03c0) :\n\u03c0 \u2208 Sn } is isomorphic to Sn . Notice that any element of G \u2240 Sn can be written uniquely as\nthe product of a single element from each of these two subgroups.\n\n\fRANDOM WALKS ON WREATH PRODUCTS OF GROUPS\n\n19\n\n3.3. Conjugacy Classes. Recall that any permutation \u03c0 \u2208 Sn can be written as the\nproduct of at most n disjoint cyclic factors. (For any index not moved by \u03c0, there is considered\nto be a cyclic factor of length one.) For any \u03c0 \u2208 Sn there is an associated n-dimensional\nvector, called the cycle type of \u03c0, which lists the number of disjoint cyclic factors of \u03c0 of each\npossible length.\nFor any (~x; \u03c0) \u2208 G \u2240 Sn , the permutation \u03c0 can be written as the product of disjoint\ncyclic factors, as described above. Suppose that \u03c0 is the product of j disjoint cyclic factors\nof lengths {k1 , . . . , kj }, respectively, with k1 + * * * + kj = n. Then \u03c0 can be written as\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c0 = (i1 i2\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n* * * ik1 ) (i1 i2\n\n(2)\n\n(j)\n\n(j)\n\n* * * ik2 ) * * * (i1 i2\n\n(j)\n\n* * * ikj )\n\n(l)\n\nwhere each im \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}. For each disjoint cyclic factor of \u03c0, we may define\ngl (~x; \u03c0) = xi(l) * xi(l) * * * * * xi(l) ,\n1\n\n2\n\nkl\n\nwhich is called the lth cycle product of (~x; \u03c0). Notice that gl (~x; \u03c0) \u2208 G for all 1 \u2264 l \u2264 j.\nSuppose that G has s conjugacy classes C1 , C2 , . . . , Cs , with C1 being the conjugacy class\nof the identity element e \u2208 G. By calculating gl (~x; \u03c0) for all 1 \u2264 l \u2264 j, we may construct an\ns \u00d7 n type matrix a(~x; \u03c0) for (~x; \u03c0) in the following manner. Let the kth entry of the jth row\nbe the number of cyclic factors of length k contained in \u03c0 for which gl (~x; \u03c0) \u2208 Cj . According\nto Theorem 4.2.8 of James and Kerber (1981), two elements of G \u2240 Sn are conjugate if and\nonly if their type matrices are identical. Notice that the vector of column sums of a(~x; \u03c0) is\nthe cycle type vector of \u03c0.\nWe are primarily interested in the type matrices of the elements in the support of the\nprobability measure defined in (3.1.1). In the identity element (~e; e) \u2208 G \u2240 Sn , the identity\npermutation e \u2208 Sn is the product of n disjoint cyclic factors each of length one, and each of\nthese cyclic factors corresponds to an identity element in ~e = (e, . . . , e) \u2208 Gn . Thus the type\nmatrix of the identity element is the s \u00d7 n matrix with a11 (~e; e) = n and the remaining\nentries all zeros.\nIn the special case of the hyperoctahedral group Z2 \u2240 Sn , we have s = 2. Thus the type\nmatrix of the identity element is\n\u0013\n\u0012\nn\n0\n0\n*\n*\n*\n0\na(~0; e) = 0 0 0 * * * 0 .\n\nNotice that in each (~u; e) \u2208 G \u2240 Sn with ~u 6= ~e, the identity permutation e \u2208 Sn is again\nthe product of n disjoint cyclic factors each of length one. However, ~u \u2208 Gn has a single nonidentity entry, which corresponds to one of the cyclic factors of the identity permutation.\nThus, there are s \u2212 1 different type matrices for these elements, each with a11 (~u; e) = n \u2212 1,\n\n\f20\n\nC.H. SCHOOLFIELD, JR.\n\nwith ak1 (~u; e) = 1 if the non-identity entry of ~u is in Ck and the remaining entries all zeros.\nHence, the elements of the form (~u; e) \u2208 G \u2240 Sn split into s \u2212 1 conjugacy classes.\nIn the special case of the hyperoctahedral group Z2 \u2240 Sn , the type matrix of each of the\nsigned identities, which together form a single conjugacy class, is\n\u0012\n\u0013\nn \u22121 0 0 ***0\na(~u; e) =\n1 0 0 ***0 .\nIn each (~v ; \u03c4 ) \u2208 G \u2240 Sn , the transposition \u03c4 \u2208 Sn is the product of n \u2212 2 cyclic factors of\n\nlength one and one cyclic factor of length two. Also, each of the n \u2212 2 cyclic factors of length\none corresponds to an identity e \u2208 G in ~v \u2208 Gn , while the only possible non-identity entries\nin ~v \u2208 Gn correspond to the one cyclic factor of length two. Thus gl (~v ; \u03c4 ) = 0 for each of the\nn \u2212 2 cyclic factors of length one, but gl (~v; \u03c4 ) can be an arbitrary element of G for the one\ncyclic factor of length two. Thus, there are s different type matrices for these elements, each\nwith a11 (~v; \u03c4 ) = n \u2212 2, with ak2 (~v; \u03c4 ) = 1 if gl (~v ; \u03c4 ) \u2208 Ck for the one cyclic factor of length\ntwo, and with the remaining entries all zeros. Hence, the elements of the form (~v; \u03c4 ) \u2208 G \u2240 Sn\nsplit into s conjugacy classes.\nIn the special case of the hyperoctahedral group Z2 \u2240 Sn , the calculation of the type\nmatrix splits the signed transpositions into two sets. Let us refer to a signed transposition\nwhich flips neither or both of the cards as an even transposition and designate it as (~v ; \u03c4 + ).\nWe will refer to one which flips either, but not both, of the cards as an odd transposition\nand designate it as (~v ; \u03c4 \u2212 ). Thus the type matrices of the even transpositions and the odd\ntranspositions are, respectively,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nn \u22122 1 0 ***0\n+\na(~v ; \u03c4 ) =\n0 0 0 ***0 ,\n\n\u2212\n\na(~v ; \u03c4 ) =\n\n\u0012\n\nn\u22122 0 0 ***0\n0 1 0 ***0\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\nWe have now identified the type matrices (and, hence, the conjugacy classes) of all the\nelements in the support of the probability measure defined in (3.1.1). Furthermore, we have\nestablished the following.\nLemma 3.3.1.\n\nThe probability measure defined in (3.1.1) is constant on conjugacy\n\nclasses.\nKnowing that there are the same number of conjugacy classes as there are type matrices\nallows us to calculate the number of conjugacy classes. According to Lemma 4.2.9 of James\nand Kerber (1981), the number of conjugacy classes of G \u2240 Sn is equal to\nX\np(n1 ) * p(n2 ) * * * p(ns )\n(n1 ,n2 ,...,ns )\n\n\fRANDOM WALKS ON WREATH PRODUCTS OF GROUPS\n\n21\n\nwhere p(k) is the number of partitions of k (with p(0) := 1) and the sum is taken over all\ns-dimensional vectors such that n1 + n2 + * * * + ns = n and nj \u2265 0 for all 1 \u2264 j \u2264 s.\nWe may also calculate the order of each of the conjugacy classes. According to Lemma\n4.2.10 of James and Kerber (1981), the number of elements of a particular type a(~x; \u03c0) in\nG \u2240 Sn , and hence the number of elements of a particular conjugacy class, is equal to\n|G|n * n!\naij * a !]\nij\ni,j [(j|G|/|Ci |)\n\nQ\n\nwhere aij is the (i, j)th element of a(~x; \u03c0) and |Ci | is the order of the ith conjugacy class of\nG. By applying this result to the elements of G \u2240 Sn whose type matrices were determined\nabove, we have the following otherwise obvious corollary.\nCorollary 3.3.2.\nare\n\n1\nn(n\n2\n\nThere are n|Ck | elements of the form (~u; e), for 2 \u2264 k \u2264 s, and there\n\n\u2212 1) * |G| * |Ck | elements of the form (~v ; \u03c4 ), for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 s.\n\n3.4. Irreducible Representations. We now construct a collection of irreducible representations of the complete monomial groups from irreducible representations of certain of\ntheir subgroups. We will later see that every irreducible representation of G \u2240 Sn can be\nconstructed in such a manner. The method used is from Section 4.3 of James and Kerber\n(1981). Other methods described in Section 8.2 of Serre (1977) and in Chapter V of Simon\n(1996) could be used in the special case when G is abelian.\nLet G\u2217 be the subgroup of G \u2240 Sn consisting of all elements of the form {(~x; e) : ~x \u2208 Gn } and\nlet H \u2217 be the subgroup of G \u2240 Sn consisting of all elements of the form {(e, . . . , e; \u03c0) : \u03c0 \u2208 Sn }.\nRecall from Section 3.2 that G\u2217 is a normal subgroup of G \u2240 Sn and that G\u2217 \u223c\n= Gn and\nH\u2217 \u223c\n= Sn . Recall, furthermore, that each element of G \u2240 Sn can be written uniquely as a\nproduct gh with g \u2208 G\u2217 and h \u2208 H \u2217 .\nSuppose that G has s conjugacy classes. Then it follows from Proposition 2.3.1 that there\nare s irreducible representations of G, namely, \u03c11 , \u03c12 , . . . , \u03c1s , where we choose our labelling so\nthat \u03c11 is the trivial representation. So it follows from Proposition 2.3.5 that any irreducible\nrepresentation of Gn is isomorphic to an n-fold tensor product\n\u03c1(1) \u2297 \u03c1(2) \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u03c1(n)\nwhere each \u03c1(i) \u2208 {\u03c11 , \u03c12 , . . . , \u03c1s }. Notice that any irreducible representation of Gn can be\nrepresented by a vector ~x \u2208 {1, . . . , s}n , where the entries of ~x correspond to the indices of\nthe factors in the tensor product above.\n\n\f22\n\nC.H. SCHOOLFIELD, JR.\n\nSuppose that the tensor product forming a particular irreducible representation of Gn\ncontains nj factors of the kind \u03c1j , for all 1 \u2264 j \u2264 s. The vector (n) = (n1 , n2 , . . . , ns ) is\ncalled the type of this representation. Notice that for each type (n) = (n1 , n2 , . . . , ns ), there\nis a unique representative whose first n1 factors in the tensor product are \u03c11 , whose next n2\nfactors are \u03c12 , etc. We will refer to this canonical representative as \u03c1(n) .\nSince Gn \u223c\n= G\u2217 = {(~x; e) : ~x \u2208 Gn }, any representation \u03c1 of Gn extends easily to a\nrepresentation of G\u2217 by setting \u03c1(~x; e) \u2261 \u03c1(~x). Thus any representation of Gn is also a\n\b\nrepresentation of G\u2217 . Therefore, the collection \u03c1(n) is a complete system of irreducible\n\nrepresentations of G\u2217 which are of different types.\nWe now turn our attention to H \u2217 = {(e, . . . , e; \u03c0) : \u03c0 \u2208 Sn } \u223c\n= Sn . For each type (n) =\n(n1 , n2 , . . . , ns ), define S(n) to be the subgroup of Sn which permutes the first n1 indices\namong themselves, the next n2 indices among themselves, etc.; but does not commingle\nthese s sets of indices. Thus S(n) \u223c\n= Sn1 \u00d7 Sn2 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Sns , where we define Snj := S1 if nj = 0\nfor any 1 \u2264 j \u2264 s.\nRecall that there is a one-to-one correspondence between irreducible representations of\nSn and partitions [\u03bb] of n, where [\u03bb] = [\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , . . . , \u03bbk ] with \u03bb1 \u2265 \u03bb2 \u2265 * * * \u2265 \u03bbk > 0 and\n\u03bb1 + \u03bb2 + * * * + \u03bbk = n. Thus any irreducible representation of Sn may be denoted as \u03c1[\u03bb] ,\nwhere [\u03bb] is the corresponding partition of n.\nIt follows from Proposition 2.3.5 that any irreducible representation of Sn1 \u00d7Sn2 \u00d7* * *\u00d7Sns\nis isomorphic to the s-fold tensor product\n\u03c1[\u03bb1 ] \u2297 \u03c1[\u03bb2 ] \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u03c1[\u03bbs ]\nwhere (\u03bb) = ([\u03bb1 ], [\u03bb2 ], . . . , [\u03bbs ]) are partitions of {n1 , n2 , . . . , ns } and {\u03c1[\u03bb1 ] , \u03c1[\u03bb2 ] , . . . , \u03c1[\u03bbs ] }\nare irreducible representations of {Sn1 , Sn2 , . . . , Sns }, respectively. We will denote this tensor\nproduct as \u03c1(\u03bb) . Thus, there is a one-to-one correspondence between irreducible representations of Sn1 \u00d7 Sn2 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Sns and ordered s-tuples of partitions of (n) = (n1 , n2 , . . . , ns ).\nSince Sn \u00d7 Sn \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Sn \u223c\n= S(n) , then any representation of Sn \u00d7 Sn \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Sn is also a\n1\n\n2\n\ns\n\n1\n\n2\n\ns\n\nrepresentation of S(n) .\n\u2217\n= {(e, . . . , e; \u03c0) : \u03c0 \u2208 S(n) }. Since S(n) is a subgroup of Sn , it follows\nLet us define S(n)\n\u2217\n\u2217 \u223c\nthat S(n) is a subgroup of Gn \u2240 Sn . Since S(n)\n= S(n) , any representation \u03c1 of S(n) extends\n\u2217\nby setting \u03c1(e, . . . , e; \u03c0) \u2261 \u03c1(\u03c0). Thus any representation\neasily to a representation of S(n)\n\u2217\nof S(n) is also a representation of S(n)\n. Therefore, for fixed type (n) = (n1 , n2 , . . . , ns ), the\n\b\n\u2217\ncollection \u03c1(\u03bb) is a complete system of irreducible representations of S(n)\n, when (\u03bb) ranges\nover all ordered s-tuples of partitions of (n1 , n2 , . . . , ns ), respectively.\n\n\fRANDOM WALKS ON WREATH PRODUCTS OF GROUPS\n\n23\n\nNow consider the wreath product G \u2240 S(n) , which is a subgroup of G \u2240 Sn .

These representations \u03c1(n) \u2297 \u03c1(\u03bb) of\nG \u2240 S(n) may now be used to induce representations of G \u2240 Sn . More importantly, we have\nthe following, which is Theorem 4.4.3 of James and Kerber (1981).\nLemma 3.4.1. The collection of representations of G \u2240 Sn induced by the collection\n\b\n\u03c1(n) \u2297 \u03c1(\u03bb) of representations of G \u2240 S(n) is a complete collection of pairwise inequivalent\nand irreducible representations of G \u2240 Sn if (n) = (n1 , n2 , . . . , ns ) ranges over all different\ntypes and, for fixed type (n), (\u03bb) = ([\u03bb1 ], [\u03bb2 ], . . . , [\u03bbs ]) ranges over all ordered s-tuples of\npartitions of (n1 , n2 , . . . , ns ), respectively.\nSince the number of irreducible representations equals the number of conjugacy classes\n(Proposition 2.3.1), it follows from the results in Section 3.3 that the number of irreducible\nrepresentations of G \u2240 Sn is equal to\nX\np(n1 ) * p(n2 ) * * * p(ns ),\n(n1 ,n2 ,...,ns )\n\nwhere p(k) is the number of partitions of k (with p(0) := 1) and the sum is taken over all\ns-dimensional vectors such that n1 + n2 + * * * + ns = n and nj \u2265 0 for all 1 \u2264 j \u2264 s. This is\nCorollary 4.4.4 of James and Kerber (1981) and is consistent with the results found above.\n3.5. Irreducible Characters. For the elements in the support of the probability measure defined in (3.1.1), we now determine the characters of the irreducible representations of\nthe complete monomial group G \u2240 Sn induced by the irreducible representations of G \u2240 S(n)\nfound in Lemma 3.4.1.

However, if |G| is moderate relative\n4\nto n, these rates of convergence are \"essentially\" the same.\nThe following table summarizes the number of steps (both necessary and sufficient) for the\ndistance (both normalized l2 and total variation) to uniformity to become small for various\nspecial cases of the independent shuffles random walk analyzed in this section.\n\n\f33\n\nRANDOM WALKS ON WREATH PRODUCTS OF GROUPS\n\nRandom walk on G \u2240 Sn\n(with independent randomizations)\nG\n\nmetric\n\nnec. or suff.\n\nl2\n\nsufficient\n\nTV\n\nnecessary\nsufficient\nnecessary\n\nl2\n\nsufficient\n\nTV\n\nnecessary\nsufficient\nnecessary\n\nl2\n\nsufficient\n\nTV\n\nnecessary\nsufficient\n\nZ2\n\nZm\n\nSm\n\nnecessary\nl\nG\nabelian\n\n2\n\nTV\n\nsufficient\nnecessary\nsufficient\nnecessary\n\nl\nG\nnonabelian\n\n2\n\nTV\n\nsufficient\nnecessary\nsufficient\nnecessary\n\nnumber of steps\n1\nn log n\n2\n1\nn log n\n2\n1\nn log n\n2\n1\nn log n\n2\n1\nn log n\n2\n1\nn log n\n2\n1\nn log n\n2\n1\nn log n\n2\n1\nn log n\n2\n1\nn log n\n2\n1\nn log n\n2\n1\nn log n\n2\n1\nn log n\n2\n1\nn log n\n2\n1\nn log n\n2\n1\nn log n\n2\n1\nn log n\n2\n1\nn log n\n2\n1\nn log n\n2\n1\nn log n\n2\n\nproof\nThm. 3.1.3\npf. of Thm. 3.1.3\nThm. 3.1.3\nThm. 2.7.3\n\n+ 14 n log(m \u2212 1)\n\nThm. 3.1.3\n\n+ 14 n log(m \u2212 1)\n\npf. of Thm. 3.1.3\nThm. 3.6.4\nThm. 2.7.3\n\n+ 14 n log(|m!| \u2212 1)\n\nThm. 3.1.3\n\n+ 14 n log(|m!| \u2212 1) pf. of Thm. 3.1.3\nThm. 3.6.4\nThm. 2.7.3\n+\n+\n\n1\nn log(|G|\n4\n1\nn log(|G|\n4\n\n\u2212 1)\n\nThm. 3.1.3\n\n\u2212 1)\n\npf. of Thm. 3.1.3\nThm. 3.6.4\nThm. 2.7.3\n\n+\n+\n\n1\nn log(|G|\n4\n1\nn log(|G|\n4\n\n\u2212 1)\n\nThm. 3.1.3\n\n\u2212 1)\n\npf. of Thm. 3.1.3\nThm. 3.6.4\nThm. 2.7.3\n\n\f34\n\nC.H. SCHOOLFIELD, JR.\n\n3.7. Analysis of the Paired Shuffles Random Walk. We now describe a slight variant of the independent shuffles random walk introduced in Section 3.1. This will provide\na second benchmark random walk, with known rate of convergence, on G \u2240 Sn for use in\nthe comparison technique. Schoolfield (1998) analyzed a random walk for which comparisons to the independent shuffles and paired shuffles random walks, in the special case of the\nhyperoctahedral group Z2 \u2240 Sn , gave different bounds.\nImagine n decks of cards, labeled 1 through n, in sequential order, each with its m cards\nin sequential order. Independently choose two integers p and q, uniformly from {1, 2, . . . , n}.\nIf p 6= q, transpose the decks in positions p and q. Then, independently of the choice of\n1\n1\n= m!\neach), permute the deck terminating\np and q and uniformly (i.e., with probability |G|\nin position p by a permutation \u03c0 \u2208 G = Sm and permute the deck terminating in position\nq by \u03c0 \u22121 \u2208 G = Sm . Notice that the only elements of the form (~v; \u03c4 ) that occur in this\n(~\nv ;\u03c4 )\ncombination of operations are from the single conjugacy class C1 . The probability that\nan element from any of the the other s \u2212 1 conjugacy classes occurs now vanishes.\nIf p = q (which occurs with probability 1/n), leave the decks in their current positions.\nThen, again independently and uniformly, permute the deck in position p = q by a permutation in G = Sm . The probabilities of the identity and of the elements (~u; e) are thus\nunchanged from the independent shuffles random walk.\nAgain, as in Section 3.1, we will actually examine a random walk on G \u2240 Sn for any\ngroup G, not just the symmetric group Sm . In this more general case, the example above\nis equivalent to beginning with a vector (e, . . . , e) \u2208 Gn , where each e \u2208 G is the identity\nelement. Two elements of this vector are then transposed as the decks of cards were above.\nThe transposed elements of this vector are then multiplied by elements of G as the individual\ndecks were permuted above.\nWe refer to the process on G \u2240 Sn described above as the paired shuffles random walk, again\nretaining use of the word \"shuffles\" even when G is not necessarily Sm . As in Section 3.1,\nthe paired spins and paired flips random walks are defined in an analogous manner in the\nspecial cases of the generalized symmetric group Zm \u2240 Sn and the hyperoctahedral group\nZ2 \u2240 Sn , respectively.\nThe paired shuffles random walk may be modeled formally by a probability measure Q on\nthe complete monomial group G \u2240 Sn . We may thus define the following probability measure\n\n\fRANDOM WALKS ON WREATH PRODUCTS OF GROUPS\n\n35\n\non the set of all elements of G \u2240 Sn :\n\n1\n,\n|G|n\n1\nwhere ~u 6= ~e \u2208 Gn ,\nQ(~u; e) =\n|G|n2\n2\n(~\nv ;\u03c4 )\nQ(~v ; \u03c4 ) =\nwhere (~v ; \u03c4 ) \u2208 C1 ,\n|G|n2\nQ(~e; e) =\n\nQ(~x; \u03c0) = 0\n\n(3.7.1)\n\notherwise,\n\nwhere there is only one non-identity entry of ~u \u2208 Gn , and where if \u03c4 \u2208 Sn is the transposition\n(p q) then the only possible non-identity entries of ~v \u2208 Gn are in positions p and q and these\nentries are mutually inverse elements of G. In the special case of the hyperoctahedral group\n(~\nv ;\u03c4 )\nZ2 \u2240 Sn , the conjugacy class C1\nis the even transpositions.\nIn order to continue our analysis of the paired shuffles random walk, we must now calculate\nthe Fourier transform of Q at each irreducible representation of the complete monomial group\nG \u2240 Sn .\n\nLemma 3.7.2. Let Q be the probability measure on G \u2240 Sn defined in (3.7.1). For the\nirreducible representation \u03c1 of G \u2240 Sn induced by the representation \u03c1(n) \u2297 \u03c1(\u03bb) of G \u2240 S(n) ,\nthe Fourier transform is\n\"\n\n#\ns\nX\nn1\nnj (nj \u2212 1)\nb\nQ(\u03c1)\n=\n+\nr(\u03bbj ) I,\n2\nn\nn2\nj=1\nwhere (n) = (n1 , . . . , ns ), (\u03bb) = ([\u03bb1 ], . . . , [\u03bbs ]), and r(\u03bbj ) = \u03c7[\u03bbj ] (\u03c4 )/d[\u03bbj ] with transposition\n\u03c4 \u2208 Sn j .\n\nProof. Notice that Q is constant on the conjugacy classes of G \u2240 Sn . It then follows\nb\nfrom Lemma 2.5.1 that Q(\u03c1)\n= C * I, where C is a constant. By applying the results from\nCorollary 3.3.2 and Lemma 3.5.1, we find that\n\n\f36\n\nC.H.

The result is established only in the limit because the proof relies on\nclassical random graph results known only (at least to us) in the limit.\nTheorem 3.7.6.\n\nLet Q and U be the probability measures on the complete monomial\n\ngroup G \u2240 Sn defined in (3.7.1) and (3.1.2), respectively.

The probability measure Q on G \u2240 Sn induces a probability measure R on Sn\nby defining\nR(\u03c0) :=\n\nX\n\nQ(~x; \u03c0).\n\n~\nx\u2208Gn\n\nNotice that R is the probability measure on Sn defined in (2.1.1).\nIn order for the paired shuffles continuized chain to achieve randomness, not only must \u03c0\nin (~x; \u03c0) be a random permutation of Sn , but also must the entries of ~x \u2208 Gn be (uniformly)\nrandom elements of G. Recall that the values of the entries in positions p and q of ~x are\nmultiplied (on the left) by mutually inverse elements of G when ~x is multiplied (on the\n(~\nv ;\u03c4 )\n\nleft) by (~v; \u03c4 ) \u2208 C1\nwith \u03c4 = (p q). In order to determine the amount of time needed\nto randomize the entries of ~x, begin with n labeled vertices. At each time that an element\n(~\nv ;\u03c4 )\n\n(~v ; (p q)) \u2208 C1\nis generated by Q, consider an edge to be generated between positions p\nand q in a graph \u0393. Let T be the time at which the graph \u0393 becomes connected.\nLet T \u2217 be the first time t > T at which Q generates an element either of the form (~u; e)\nor (~e; e). So we may suppose that at time T \u2217 , an element xi \u2208 ~x is multiplied (on the left)\nby a uniformly chosen random element g \u2208 G. Thus xi is now randomized. Since T \u2217 > T ,\nit follows that there exist elements xj1 , . . . , xjm \u2208 ~x, with j1 , . . . , jm 6= i and m \u2265 1, such\nthat, for 1 \u2264 l \u2264 m, at some time tjl \u2264 T , the entry xjl was multiplied (on the left) by a\nuniformly chosen random element hl \u2208 G and xi was multiplied by h\u22121\n\u2208 G. But since xi\nl\nis now randomized, it follows that xj1 , . . . , xjm are also. By then considering the elements\n\"paired\" with xj1 , . . . , xjm , and so forth, this argument continues on to show that at time T \u2217\nall of the elements of ~x are randomized.\nSince elements either of the form (~u; e) or (~e; e) are generated by Q at exponential rate\n\u03bb = 1/n, we have\n\n\f43\n\nRANDOM WALKS ON WREATH PRODUCTS OF GROUPS\n\nP {T \u2217 \u2212 T \u2264 s} = 1 \u2212 e\u2212s/n .\nIt then follows from the independence of T and T \u2217 \u2212 T that\nZ t\n\u2217\n1 \u2212s/n\ne\nP {T > t \u2212 s} ds\nP {T > t} =\nn\ns=0\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ne\u2212u P {T > t \u2212 un} I {u \u2264 t/n} du.\n\nu=0\n(~\nx;\u03c4 )\n\nSince each element of the form (~x; (p q)) \u2208 C1\n\n, which transposes a particular pair of entries\n\n{p, q}, is generated by Q at exponential rate \u03bb = 2/n2 , the indicator (call it I{p,q} (t)) of the\npresence of any given edge {p, q} in \u0393 at time t has expectation\n2\n\n1 \u2212 e\u22122t/n .\nMoreover (and this is the advantage of working in continuous time), the stochastic processes\nI{p,q} (*) are mutually independent.

The author\nwishes to thank his advisor Jim Fill, whose assistance was invaluable, particularly in the proof\nof Theorem 3.7.6. The author also wishes to thank Persi Diaconis for initially suggesting that\nhe analyze a random walk on the hyperoctahedral group. It is from that initial challenge that\nthis paper has evolved.\nREFERENCES\nAlperin, J. and Bell, R. (1995). Groups and Representations.
