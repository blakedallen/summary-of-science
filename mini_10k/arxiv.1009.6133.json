These measurements are critical for characterizing the low energy, non-perturbative regime\nof p \u2212 p interactions, which are only be described with phenomenological models. In order to produce measurements\nwhich are maximally inclusive and minimize model dependencies, ATLAS has used a highly efficient single-armed\nscintillator trigger as the primary means of data collection. A complementary trigger, based on randomly selected\nbunch crossings and information from the tracking detectors, has been used as a control trigger. The excellent\nperformance of these triggers have allowed ATLAS to measure charged particle properties at three center of mass\nenergies within well defined phase spaces, including several with a minimum particle pT of 100 MeV [4, 5]. These\nproceedings document their performance. Section II describes the ATLAS detector and trigger system. Section III\npresents the scintillator detector performance and the minimum bias trigger efficiencies are shown in Section IV.\nSection V draws conclusions. This work is further detailed in [6].\n\nII.\n\nTHE ATLAS DETECTOR AND MINIMUM BIAS TRIGGERS\n\nThe ATLAS experiment at the LHC is a multi-purpose detector designed for studying the full suite of physics\nmeasurements possible at a high energy proton collider. The minimum bias triggers are provided by the Minimum\nBias Trigger Scintillators (MBTS) and the silicon based tracking detectors, the Pixel detector and the Semi Conductor\nTracker (SCT). Triggering is facilitated by a three level architecture starting with hardware based triggers at Level\n1. The individual sub detectors send Level 1 decisions to the Central Trigger Processor (CTP) which sets the global\ntrigger bits. Software decisions are made at Level 2 using partial detector information with the exception of the Inner\nDetector, for which all hits are read out. The third level, the Event Filter, does a full event reconstruction in order\nto select the final events.\nThe MBTS detectors consist of 2 cm thick polystyrene scintillators mounted 3.6 m from the nominal center of the\ndetector. They cover 2.09 < |\u03b7| < 3.84 and are divided into 2 rings in |\u03b7| (2.09, 2.82) and (2.82,3.84), and 8 sections\nin \u03c6, allowing for 16 possible hits per detector side. They are read out by wavelength shifting fibers embedded in\nthe scintillator. At Level 1 a leading edge discriminator determines if the energy deposited in a particular counter\npasses the threshold. The outputs of all of the counters are sent to the CTP which sets the MBTS X bit, where\nX = 1, 2 or 4, the minimum number of MBTS counters over threshold per event, or the MBTS X X bit, indicating at\nleast X counters on each side of the the MBTS detector are over threshold. The software based triggers were run in\npass-through mode, although a more sophisticated fitting of the scintillator signals was used to compute the charge\ncollected per counter at Level 2.\nThe Inner Detector provides charged particle tracking up to an |\u03b7| of 2.5 and consists of three tracking technologies:\n\nProceedings of HCP2010 \u2013 Toronto\n\n\f1\n\n2\n\n0.98\n\n1\n0\n\nEfficiency\n\n\u03c6 [rad]\n\nATLAS Preliminary\n\n3\n\n1\n0.98\n\n0.96\n\n0.96\n\n0.94\n\n0.94\n\n0.92\n\n0.92\n\n-1\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n-2\n\n0.88\n\n0.88\n\n0.86\n\n0.86\n\n-3\n2.1 2.15 2.2 2.25 2.3 2.35 2.4 2.45 2.5\n\nData\n\nATLAS Preliminary\n\nMC\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n|\u03b7|\n\n(a)\n\n2\n\n3\n\u03c6 [rad]\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 1: (a): Efficiency for the A side of the MBTS counters measured in data as a function of the probe track \u03b7 and \u03c6 at the\npoint of intercept with the MBTS.

In both\ncases see text for definition of the efficiency.\n\ntwo silicon based detectors and a third detector utilizing transition radiation in a straw tube structure. The mbSpT rk\ntrigger uses the Pixel and SCT detectors. The Pixel detector has 50x400 \u03bcm pixels arranged in three barrel layers\nand two endcaps of three layers each. The SCT has 4 double sided layers of 80 \u03bcm wide silicon strips in the barrel\nand nine layers in each of two end caps. Both systems have extremely low noise; the Pixel(SCT) detector has an\noccupancy of 10\u22129 (10\u22125 ) noise hits per event. The mbSpT rk trigger is fed by a random sampling of colliding bunches\nat Level 1. At Level 2 clustering of the pixel and SCT hits is performed. The pixel clusters consist of at least one\npixel hit, while in the SCT at least one hit from each side of the double sided layers is required to form a cluster.\nThe mbSpT rk trigger requires at least 4 pixel and 4 SCT clusters at Level 2. The Event Filter has the ability to run\ntrack reconstruction to suppress beam backgrounds, however the background rate is negligible, therefore it is run in\npass through mode.\n\nIII.\n\nMBTS PERFORMANCE FOR 7 TEV DATA TAKING\n\nThe MBTS response to charged particles was probed in data and Monte Carlo using tracks extrapolated to the\ndetector in the region where the Inner Detector and MBTS overlap, 2.09 < | \u03b7 | < 2.5. Each track in this region\nwas extrapolated to the MBTS and the resulting \u03b7 and \u03c6 position was used to determine which counter was hit. An\nefficiency was defined by the fraction of times the intersected counter charge was greater than 0.15 pC, a threshold set\nto be above the noise level measured in data, when exactly one track intersected it. Figure 1(a) shows this efficiency\nas a function of the \u03b7 and \u03c6 of the track in data. It can be seen that the overall efficiency is high and that there\nare counter to counter variations. The decrease in efficiency at low \u03b7 is dominated by extrapolation error on the\ntracks. The right plot shows the efficiency integrated over 2.2 < |\u03b7| <2.5 for the C side of the MBTS compared for\ndata and Monte Carlo. Here the counter to counter variations of several percent are evident in the data whereas the\nMC shows a constant response. The variations are attributed to differences in the operating points of the different\ncounters. Additionally the drop at the edges of the counters is more pronounced in the data due to the fact the the\nMonste Carlo does not model the decrease in light collection efficiency at the edges of the counters.\n\nIV.\n\nMBTS TRIGGER EFFICIENCIES\n\nThe MBTS X trigger efficiencies were measured in data using events passing mbSpT rk as the reference data\nsample.

Both the beam background rates\nand the multiple interaction rates were negligible in the runs used for the measurement. The efficiency is defined as\n\u01ebMBTS\n\nX\n\n=\n\nMBTS X & mbSpT rk & OfflineTrack\nmbSpT rk & OfflineTrack\n\nand plotted as a function of the number of tracks in the event in Figure 2. Figure 2(a) shows that the MBTS 1 trigger\nis highly efficient for events with low numbers of tracks, even with a low pT threshold. The errors include systematic\nuncertainties due to the offline track selection and biases caused by using mbSpT rk as the reference trigger. The\nlatter was investigated in Monte Carlo and found to be negligible. Figure 2(b) shows the efficiencies for several\nMBTS trigger configurations. Only statistical errors are shown. It is noted that the MBTS 2 trigger, which is less\nsensitive to beam related backgrounds, is nearly as efficient as the MBTS 1 trigger. Additionally the plots show\nthat the requirement of coincidence, shown by MBTS 1 1 and MBTS 4 4, significantly reduces the efficiency for low\nmultiplicities.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe ATLAS Minimum Bias triggers have shown excellent performance during the early phase of the LHC physics\nprogram. Because of their high efficiency and inclusiveness, these triggers have allowed ATLAS to measure charged\nparticle properties of p \u2212 p collisions with minimal model dependence and significant impact on the study of soft\nparticle interactions.\n\n[1] ATLAS Collaboration, G.
