However, this is only the hypothesis which does not have any\nexperimental proofs. In the nearest future this concept should be rejected. From\none side, because of it gives very meager possibility to explain physical origin\nof great number of phenomena in nonlinear optics. Frequently such phenomena\nhave good mathematical description on the base of Bloch equations. However,\nthese equations do not have clear physical sense. The concept of interference of\n\"wave packets\" or coherent states of molecules is usually used for explanation\nof the origin of nonlinear phenomena. However, the concept of coherent states\nin itself does not have clear and reliable physical base [1,2]. The concept of\ninequality of forward and reversed processes is the alternative analog of the\nconcept of coherent states. In contrast to latter concept, it has clear physical\nsense and gives good base for explanation of the origin of number of phenomena\nin nonlinear optics [3].\nFrom other side, the equivalence concept should be rejected because of the\nopposite concept even today has several direct experimental proofs [4]. However,\nthe concept of time noninvariance is so radical for optics, that it is not clear today how many experimental proofs will need for its recognition. A femtosecond\nlasers should play important role here.\nThe obtained experimental results show, that the difference in cross-sections\nof forward and reversed processes can exceed many orders of magnitude [5, 6].\nThe cross-section of reversed transition, obviously, has very sharp dependence\nfrom the orientation of molecules in space, from the phase of vibrational motion\nof atoms and even from the phase of laser radiation in the space. The classical\npump-probe experiments with femtosecond laser pulses will give, probably, the\nmost exact information of such kind. In such experiments two demands must\nbe fulfilled:\n1) - the pump and probe beams should be exactly collinear,\n2) - the pump pulse should not saturate optical transition and the probe\npulse should be very weak avoiding changing the distribution of species on the\n1 Electronic\n\naddress: kuzmenko@triniti.ru\n\n1\n\n\fenergy levels.\nOnly such arrangement allows to obtain correctly information about the crosssection of reversed optical transitions. The principle set up of such experiments\nis shown in Fig.1a, where a fluorescence of excited species is used in a detection\nscheme.\nIt is surprising, but among the huge number of pump-probe experiments\nwith femtosecond lasers such experimental arrangement is not used till now.\nThe weak probe pulse is usually used in the cross beams geometry. This case\nsuits for four photon mixing, but does not suit for the study of the reversed\ntransitions into the initial state.\nThe most closely related experiments were carried out in [7-10]. The authors\nstudied the fluorescence of molecules or atoms (which characterizes the population of excited states) after it interaction with the pair of collinear phase-locked\nfemtosecond laser pulses. However, the authors used equal intensity of pump\nand probe pulses. Such experiments should be continued in low intensity regime\nwith weak collinear probe pulse. Close to ideal intensity regime was used in [11],\nbut the demand of colinearity was not fulfilled. In proper conditions some amplification of probe laser radiation without inversion should be observed in some\ndegree similar to results of [5]. It allows to make the evaluation of difference in\ncross-sections of forward and reversed transitions.\nHere, the widely spread mistake exists that femtosecond laser radiation can\nalign molecules in the so-called field free regime [12, 13]. This point of view\ndoes not have reliable experimental proofs. Our explanation is that the observed revivals are the manifestation of very sharp dependence of the reversed\nRaman transition's cross-section from orientation of molecule in the space [14].\nThe discussed low intensity collinear pump-probe experiments will make this\nsituation clear. The principle scheme for reversed Raman transitions study is\nshown in Fig.1b. As a detection tool, the high harmonic generation (HHG) [15],\nthe Coulomb explosion imaging [16] or polarization [17] techniques may be used.\nThe pump femtosecond pulse produces forward Raman transitions between the\nground states of molecules. The strong reading pulse is fixed in time and turned\non the strong delayed revival. The weak collinear probe laser pulse is used for\nstudy the efficiency of reversed Raman transitions. Rather close experiments\nwere carried out recently in [17, 18]. However, again the intensity of probe\npulses was too strong.\nAs a detection scheme in such experiments a four photon mixing phenomenon\nin the so-called boxcars arrangement may be used [19, 20]. In such way the\nhigh quality experimental result with Raman transitions were obtained recently\nin [21]. It demonstrates not the suppression of alignment, but the erasing of\nstored information by efficient reversed process under action of the probe pulse\n(as a whole quite similar to those in [10]). The additional experiments with\nlow intensity collinear probe pulses will give some information about relative\ncross-section of the reversed Raman transitions into the initial state.\nIn conclusion, we discussed the experiments with weak collinear probe femtosecond laser pulses for time invariance violation study in optics. Such experiments will allow us to understand and to give clear physical explanation\n2\n\n\ffor number of nonlinear phenomena, like as the population transfer or so-called\n\"coherent control\" [22].\n\nReferences\n[1] K.Molmer, Phys.Rev.A 55, 3195 (1997).\n[2] K.Nemoto, and S.L.Braunstein, E-print, quant-ph/0312108.\n[3] V.A.Kuz'menko, E-print, physics/0306148.\n[4] V.A.Kuz'menko, E-print, physics/0506023.\n[5] C.Liedenbaum, S.Stolte, and J.Reuss, Chem.Phys. 122, 443 (1988).\n[6] B.Dayan,\nA.Pe'er,\nquant-ph/0401088.\n\nA.A.Friesem\n\nand\n\nY.Silberberg,\n\nE-print,\n\n[7] N.F.Scherer, A.J.Ruggiero, M.Du, and G.R.Fleming, J.Chem.Phys. 93, 856\n(1990).\n[8] N.F.Scherer, R.J.Carlson, A.Matro, M.Du, A.J.Ruggiero, V.RomeroRochin, J.A.Cina, G.R.Fleming, and S.A.Rice, J.Chem.Phys. 95, 1487\n(1991).\n[9] H.Yamada, K.Yokoyama, Y.Teranishi, A.Sugita, T.Shirai, M.Aoyama,\nY.Akahane, N.Inoue, H.Ueda, K.Yamakawa, A.Yokoyama, M.Kawasaki,\nand H.Nakamura, Phys.Rev.
