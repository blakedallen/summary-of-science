First we summarize experimental results on SCES by focusing\non typical materials such as cuprates, BEDT-TTF organic superconductors, and ruthenate Sr2 RuO4 .\nExperimental results on other important SCES, heavy-fermion systems, will be reviewed separately. The\nformalism to discuss superconducting properties of SCES is shown based on the Dyson-Gor'kov equations. Here two typical methods to evaluate the vertex function are introduced: One is the perturbation\ncalculation up to the third-order terms with respect to electron correlation. Another is the fluctuationexchange (FLEX) method based on the Baym-Kadanoff conserving approximation. The results obtained\nby the FLEX method are in good agreement with those obtained by the perturbation calculation. In\nfact, a reasonable value of Tc for spin-singlet d-wave superconductivity is successfully reproduced by using both methods for SCES such as cuprates and BEDT-TTF organic superconductors. As for Sr2 RuO4\nexhibiting spin-triplet superconductivity, it is quite difficult to describe the superconducting transition\nby using the FLEX calculation. However, the superconductivity can be naturally explained by the perturbation calculation, since the third-order terms in the anomalous self-energy play the essential role to\nrealize the triplet superconductivity. Another important purpose of this article is to review anomalous\nelectronic properties of SCES near the Mott transition, since the nature of the normal state in SCES\nhas been one of main issues to be discussed. Especially, we focus on pseudogap phenomena observed\nin under-doped cuprates and organic superconductors. A variety of scenarios to explain the pseudogap\nphenomena based on the superconducting and/or spin fluctuations are critically reviewed and examined\nin comparison with experimental results. According to the recent theory, superconducting fluctuations,\ninherent in the quasi-two-dimensional and strong-coupling superconductors, are the origin of the pseudogap formation. In these compounds, superconducting fluctuations induce a kind of resonance between the\nFermi-liquid quasi-particle and the Cooper-pairing states. This resonance gives rise to a large damping\neffect of quasi-particles and reduces the spectral weight near the Fermi energy. We discuss the magnetic\nand transport properties as well as the single-particle spectra in the pseudogap state by the microscopic\ntheory of the superconducting fluctuations. As for heavy-fermion superconductors, experimental results\nare reviewed and several theoretical analyses on the mechanism are provided based on the same viewpoint\nas explained above.\nkeywords:

Introduction\nIn recent decades, elucidation of unconventional superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems (SCES) has been one of the central issues both in experimental and theoretical research fields of\ncondensed matter physics. As is well known, SCES form a vast category, including varieties of materials such as transition metal oxides, molecular conductors, and f -electron compounds. Here we briefly\nintroduce these superconducting materials in this order.\nAmong transition metal oxides, cuprate superconductors have certainly attracted the most attentions\nof researchers in the condensed matter physics since the discovery in 1986 [ 1, 2], due to the high superconducting transition temperature Tc as well as several kinds of anomalous behaviors in the electronic\nproperties. In fact, the high-Tc cuprate is one of main targets of this review article. It is emphasized here\nthat varieties of superconducting materials have been also discovered in other transition metal oxides.\nEspecially, Sr2 RuO4 [ 3] with isostructure of La2 CuO4 (the parent compound of high Tc superconductors) exhibits the superconductivity with triplet pairing, which has been confirmed by nuclear magnetic\nresonance (NMR) measurements [ 4]. The ruthenate has attracted attentions in spite of its low Tc as\nlarge as 1.5K, since it is one of rare materials that show triplet superconductivity in the solid state. The\nruthenate will be also discussed in detail in this review article.\nIn addition to d-electron systems, materials composed of atoms with lighter mass are also the member\nof SCES. In general, those are called molecular conductors, including organics and fullerides. In 1980,\n(TMTSF)2 PF6 has been discovered as the first organic superconductor [ 5], which has triggered the\nvigorous experimental researches on these materials. A characteristic issue of the molecular conductors\nis that it is possible to construct artificial molecule by controlling the synthesis in the atomic level.\nThen, much effort has been made to elevate Tc by using several techniques to synthesize new molecular\nsuperconductors.\nLet us turn our attentions to f -electron materials including rare-earth or actinide ions. The pioneering\ndiscovery of superconductivity in the heavy fermion material CeCu2 Si2 [ 6] has triggered the rapid\nincrease of investigations on exotic properties of f -electron superconductivity, leading to a chain of further\ndiscoveries of superconductivity in uranium and cerium compounds. As we will review in Sec. 5, numbers\nof new superconducting materials in heavy fermion systems have been discovered in recent years. Here\nit is noted that new superconducting states such as coexisting one with magnetic orders are increasing.\nEven in the above brief survey, there are several kinds of superconductors categorized in SCES. It\nis quite natural for experimentalists to make the research field rich, as a result of high activities to\nsynthesize new superconducting materials. However, the purpose in the theoretical research is not to\npursue the variety in materials, although at some stage it is necessary to investigate a particular material\nas a typical example. There should exist a universal picture to explain the common essence in all SCES.\nA task imposed on theoreticians is to unveil this universal concept, and to clarify the interesting aspects\nin materials. We believe that we have arrived at a unified view on the superconductivity in SCES. Thus,\nthe main purpose of this review article is to convey this viewpoint by showing explanations for typical\nmaterials.\nBefore proceeding to the clarification of our unified viewpoint, let us consider first the conditions on\nthe theory of superconductivity in SCES. Without any restrictions, the present review article may be\njust the exhibition of previous theories for SCES. The most exotic possibility for the superconducting\nmechanism was superconductivity due to single-electron condensation, but the experimental results on\nthe unit of magnetic flux in high-Tc materials have confirmed that the existence of Cooper-pair in high-Tc\ncuprates [ 7]. Also in heavy-fermion superconductors, the existence of Cooper-pair has been experimentally confirmed. Those are quite important, since the basic point of the BCS theory for superconductivity\nare invariant even for SCES. Thus, in this review, issues on exotic superconductivity based on the non\nCooper-pair formation are simply ignored.\nFurthermore, here we clarify our strategy to understand the electric properties in the normal state before discussing the pairing mechanism. In the normal state of strongly correlated materials, \"anomalous\"\nmetallic behaviors have been frequently observed. Namely, behaviors of physical quantities are sometimes deviated from those understood from the Fermi-liquid theory. Especially in high-Tc cuprates, such\n\"anomalous\" bahaviors have provided many challenging issues and stimulated much interests. Indeed,\nthe understanding of the \"anomalous\" metallic state is one of the central issues in this review. One way\nto explain such non Fermi-liquid behaviors is, of course, to pursue the non Fermi-liquid ground state,\n\n\f5\nappearing due to the combined effects of strong correlation and low dimensionality. In fact, as is well\nknown in one dimension, there appears the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid state, essentially different from\nthe Fermi-liquid state, due to the restriction in the phase space of one dimension. No doubt is cast on the\nresults in one dimension and we know that there exist several approaches based on the non Fermi-liquid\nground state in order to understand the anomalous normal-state properties of strongly correlated metals.\nHowever, it should be noted that non Fermi-liquid behaviors do not immediately indicate the breakdown\nof the Fermi-liquid theory in strongly correlated materials with two or three dimensionality. We believe\nthat the Fermi-liquid state is a good starting point to understand the non Fermi-liquid behaviors in some\ncompounds. If there is no discontinuity from the Fermi-liquid state, the deviation from the Fermi-liquid\nbehaviors should be derived from such a starting point. In this review, we will actually explain the non\nFermi-liquid behaviors from this point of view, but it is worth while to stress here that the Fermi-liquid\nstate is a robust concept in two or three dimensions. The essential issue of the Fermi-liquid state is the\ncontinuity principle, which means that quasi-particles can be obtained by the adiabatic continuations from\nthe non-interacting systems. Even if the overlap between bare electron state and dressed quasi-particle\nstate is vanishingly small like in f -electron materials, the continuity principle can be still effective.\nHere readers may have a naive question in their minds: Then, how to understand anomalous behaviors\nin the normal state? First note that the conventional Fermi-liquid bahaviors may be restricted to the\nvery low-temperature region, even if the ground state is a Fermi liquid. Such a situation is considered\nto be realized in some heavy-fermion compounds, owing to a strong renormalization of the Fermi energy.\nEven if the quasi-particle renormalization is not so strong like in high-Tc cuprates, this situation can be\ncaused by some kinds of fluctuations, which give corrections to the Fermi-liquid behaviors. The latter\neffect possibly appears more significantly, when the long-range order exists in the ground state. Since the\nFermi-liquid state is eventually destroyed by the long-range order, it is quite natural that the Fermi-liquid\nbehaviors are altered by its precursor, namely, by the fluctuation. We will attribute the non Fermi-liquid\nbehaviors in the high-Tc cuprates and some organic superconductors to the latter origin. In particular,\nthe superconducting (SC) fluctuation as well as the anti-ferromagnetic (AF) spin fluctuation should be\ntaken into account. In those compounds, the effects of such fluctuations are significantly enhanced owing\nto quasi-two-dimensionality. The effective inclusion of fluctuations in the Fermi-liquid state will lead to\nunderstandings of anomalous behaviors in the normal state.\nA trial to take into account the effect of AF spin fluctuations in the Fermi-liquid normal state has been\ndeveloped for a long time, since the AF insulating phase can be ubiquitously found in strongly correlated\nmaterials. The AF fluctuations are especially important near the phase boundary between metallic and\nAF insulating phases. For instance, the self-consistent renormalization (SCR) theory developed by Moriya\nand co-workers is one of the powerful methods to include effects of spin fluctuations, but the details will\nbe simply skipped, since readers can consult with the textbook [ 8]. It is commented here that the AF spin\nfluctuation theory should be interpreted as an extension of the Fermi-liquid theory [ 9], which is called\n\"nearly anti-ferromagnetic Fermi-liquid theory\" at present. The AF spin fluctuation is actually effective in\nhigh-Tc cuprates, in which the NMR and neutron scattering measurements have clearly observed the spin\nfluctuations. For example, the anomalous temperature dependence of the electric resistivity is explained\nby including the AF spin fluctuation. Interestingly, the cross-over from the conventional T -square to the\nanomalous T -linear resistivity has been observed in Tl-based cuprate superconductors [ 10], which occurs\ntogether with the enhancement of the AF spin fluctuation. Then, a coherent understanding is obtained\nby extending the Fermi-liquid theory to take into account the AF spin fluctuation. Such a continuity\nclearly indicates that the theory based on the Fermi-liquid picture is quite useful and effective for strongly\ncorrelated systems.\nAnother effort has been devoted to include the effect of SC fluctuations. This is closely related to the\nmost challenging issue in the\"anomalous\" metallic state, the pseudogap phenomenon, which is focussed\nin this review. Among many theoretical proposals suggested before, we will introduce an understanding\nbased on the SC fluctuation. Since high-Tc cuprates and organic superconductors have the superconducting ground state, it is expected that the SC fluctuation should be active in these materials at least\nnear the phase transition. It has been common knowledge that the SC fluctuation is usually negligible,\nbut the recent theoretical efforts, which has been stimulated by the recent experimental results, have\nrevealed the importance of the SC fluctuation for the electronic properties. We will clarify the condition\nfor the appearance of the SC fluctuation and show that the condition is actually satisfied in high-Tc\n\n\f6\ncuprates and some organic superconductors. Then, the precursor of the phase transition destroys the\nFermi-liquid state and induces the excitation gap. Many aspects of the anomalous properties, including\nthe magnetic and transport properties, are successfully explained by starting from the Fermi-liquid state\nand taking into account appropriately the effect of AF spin fluctuation and/or SC fluctuation [ 11], as\nwill be explained in Sec. 4 in details. The scenario based on the Fermi-liquid theory is rather simple, but\nthe simple and unified scenario makes it easy to understand anomalous behaviors in SCES.\nNow our footing of this review article becomes clear, and the next point is how to clarify the mechanism\nof the Cooper-pair formation. First it is emphasized that a couple of quasi-particles form the Cooperpair. Typically, in heavy-fermion superconductivity, the Cooper-pair is composed of heavy quasi-particles\nthemselves, as confirmed by the large jump in the specific heat at Tc . The investigation of pairing\nmechanism is reduced to the determination of the residual interaction among quasi-particles. As easily\nunderstood, non s-wave pairing should appear for superconductivity in highly correlated systems due to\nthe effect of strong short-range Coulomb interaction. In fact, anisotropic Cooper-pair has been found\nin common in strongly correlated superconductors, experimentally suggested by the power-law behavior\nof physical quantities in the low-temperature region. The value of the power sensitively depends on the\nnode structure of the gap function on the Fermi surface. Thus, by analysing carefully the temperature\ndependence of physical quantities in experiments, it is possible to deduce the symmetry of the Cooperpair under the group-theoretical restriction. The phenomenological theory, which is not focused in this\nreview, plays an important role for the determination of the pairing symmetry. Since the superconducting\ntransition is the second-order phase transition even for SCES, the Ginzburg-Landau theory has been still\napplicable to those systems, by paying due attentions to the symmetry of Cooper-pair as well as the\ngroup-theoretical restrictions on the crystal structure. In fact, there have been significant advances in the\nphenomenological understandings on unconventional superconductivity without special knowledge on the\nmechanism of Cooper-pair formation [ 12]. In particular, when the degeneracy remains in the internal\ndegree of freedom in the triplet superconductor, the phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory has been\nquite useful to identify the pairing symmetry.\nWhen ones tried to discuss the microscopic aspects of the mechanism of unconventional superconductivity, again AF spin fluctuations were considered to play crucial roles to induce singlet d-wave superconductivity, consistent with the node structure in high-Tc cuprates. Indeed, the theory based on the\nAF spin fluctuations has provided many important understandings in high-Tc superconductors, as will be\nexplained later. However, in order to arrive at the unified understanding of superconductivity in SCES,\nmore general viewpoint should be considered, since the pairing potential originating from the residual\ninteraction among quasi-particles is not always dominated by the spin fluctuations. The most general\nconclusion is that the origin of the Cooper-pair formation is the momentum dependence of the residual\ninteraction. We believe that this point of view is important for the comprehensive understanding of\nsuperconductivity in SCES including high-Tc cuprates.\nA clear example for our belief can be found in the triplet superconductivity confirmed in some d- and\nf -electron systems such as Sr2 RuO4 and UPt3 [ 4, 13]. In order to understand the triplet pair formation,\none may naively consider the effect of ferromagnetic spin fluctuations, which was proposed for the origin\nof spin-triplet superfluidity in 3 He. However, in the triplet superconductors, paramagnons are not always\ndominant in the spin fluctuation spectrum. The ruthenate Sr2 RuO4 is a typical example. We have\nfound that the incommensurate AF spin fluctuation is enhanced, as observed in the neutron scattering\nexperiment [ 14]. Then, in contrast to the naive expectation, paramagnons do not seem to play a central\nrole in the occurrence of triplet superconductivity. In such a case, we have to consider the momentum\ndependence of the residual interaction from the general point of view. As we will discuss in detail in\nthis review, it is possible to explain triplet as well as singlet superconductivity, in addition to several\nanomalous behaviors in the normal state, based on the microscopic Hamiltonian, leading to the unified\npicture for unconventional superconductivity in SCES.\nFor the purpose, it is indispensable to choose appropriately the method for the calculation. One is the\napplication of numerical techniques such as exact diagonalization and quantum Monte Carlo simulations.\nThere is a clear advantage that in principle we can include the effect of electronic correlation correctly,\nbut in the exact diagonalization, the size of the model is severely restricted due to the limitation in\ncomputer memory. Also in the quantum Monte Carlo simulations, it is quite difficult to increase the\nstrength of correlation because of the negative sign problem and the system size is still restricted. On the\n\n\f7\nother hand, recently developed technique such as density matrix renormalization group method is very\npowerful to analyze quantum systems even with frustrations. However, the target material is essentially\nlimited to the one-dimensional system, even though it may be possible to treat ladder-like compounds.\nComplementary to the numerical method, another traditional technique is the quantum field theory, or\nmore specifically, the Green's function method, based on the assumption that it is allowed to perform the\nperturbation expansion in terms of the interaction. It is an advantage that we can calculate, in principle,\nphysical quantities in the thermodynamic limit, while it is inevitable to resort to approximations for\nactual calculations, since it is quite difficult to carry out the exact calculation based on the Green's\nfunction method. Another important advantage is that the physical picture is to be clarified. In this\narticle, we focus on the Green's function technique and the results obtained by this method. It matches\nour principle based on the Fermi-liquid theory. We will introduce an understanding obtained by the\ncombination of the numerical techniques and the Green's function approaches [ 15], but the techniques\nof numerical methods will not be introduced in this review article. Readers consult with other review\narticles regarding those issues (See, for instance, Ref. [ 16]).\nNext, we need to define a microscopic model Hamiltonian. In this paper, the Hubbard Hamiltonian\nwill be focussed, since it is widely recognized as a canonical model for SCES, although for f -electron\nsystems, we need to pay due attentions for its application. We will also consider the multi-orbital\nHubbard model, in which orbital degree of freedom of d electrons is explicitly included, especially for the\nanalysis of ruthenate. For the purpose to study electronic properties of SCES, ones sometimes considered\nthe so-called t-J model, obtained by the strong-coupling expansion in the Hubbard or d-p model. The\nprohibition of double occupancy at each site is imposed on the model, which is an essential point to\ninclude the strong correlation effect in the t-J model. Since the Hilbert space becomes smaller than\nthat of the Hubbard model, the t-J model has been frequently used for the analysis based on numerical\ntechniques. However, in the Green's function method or even in simpler mean-field calculations, it is\ndifficult to include correctly the prohibition of double occupancy. Thus, results and analysis on the t-J\nmodel are out of the scope of this review article. Readers interested in the t-J model can also consult\nwith other previous review papers [ 16].\nIn this review article, then we will show the unified picture to understand unconventional superconductivity in SCES based on the Fermi-liquid framework by using the Hubbard (or Hubbard-like) Hamiltonian\nand the Green's function method. The calculations will be done based on the Dyson-Gor'kov equations [\n17], composed of normal and anomalous Green's functions to characterize the normal and superconducting states. Formally those are the coupled equations, related by the irreducible four-point vertex functions\nrepresenting the interaction processes among quasi-particles. Depending on the effective strength of the\ninteraction, we change our approaches to evaluate the four-point irreducible vertex.\nFor the weak correlation systems, we adopt the third-order perturbation theory with respect to the onsite Coulomb interaction U [ 18, 19]. By solving the linearized Dyson-Gor'kov equations, we can determine\nTc , which will well reproduce the critical temperatures for cuprates from overdoped to optimally doped\nregions. Moreover, this perturbation theory gives reasonable values of Tc also for organic superconductors\n\u03ba-type (BEDT-TTF)2 X [ 20]. The symmetry of these two superconductors is considered to be the d-wave\none from various experimental results. Theoretical calculations also predict the d-wave symmetry.\nIn addition to the above results, it should be stressed that the perturbation theory gives also a reasonable explanation of the mechanism of triplet superconductivity in Sr2 RuO4 [ 21]. The third-order terms\nin the vertex function play main roles in realizing the triplet superconductivity. Note that these terms\nare not attributed to the contribution from the spin fluctuations. This fact is in sharp contrast with the\nspin fluctuation mechanism adopted in cuprates, while it is consistent with the absence of paramagnon\npeak in neutron diffraction experiments on ruthenate.\nFor the intermediate coupling systems such as optimally doped cuprates, we adopt the fluctuationexchange (FLEX) approximation [ 22] to evaluate the irreducible four-point vertex parts. This theory\nbased on the spin fluctuations has been developed by many groups and used to give reasonable value of Tc\nfor the d-wave superconductivity. We confirm the reliability of these calculations by comparing the FLEX\nand the third-order perturbation calculations with each other. From the above calculation we conclude\nthat the momentum dependence in the effective interaction between quasi-particles originating initially\nfrom the on-site Coulomb repulsion U induces the superconductivity. The FLEX approximation is again\nused for the analysis of the anomalous properties in the normal state. In order to take into account the\n\n\f8\neffect of the superconducting fluctuations, the FLEX approximation is modified to be combined with\nthe T-matrix approximation. By using this FLEX + T-matrix approximation, we develop a microscopic\ntheory on the SC fluctuation and analyze the under-doped cuprates.\nThe organization of this review article is as follows. In Sec. 2, experimental review will be provided\nregarding high-Tc cuprates, organic superconductors, and ruthenate. The interests from the theoretical\npoint of view will be also explained. As is easily understood, those materials should include millions of\nreferences, and it is almost impossible to cite all papers. Thus, we will refer several papers, which will be\nrelevant to the later theoretical discussions. In Sec. 3, theoretical results are reviewed based on the Green's\nfunction techniques. First we introduce some basic equations which will be needed for the later analysis.\nThen, the results for cuprates, organic superconductors, and ruthenate will be discussed in this order.\nIn Sec. 4, as a typical result in the anomalous normal-state properties of high-Tc cuprates, pseudogap\nphenomena will be discussed somewhat in detail. In Sec. 5, after the brief review of experimental results\non f -electron superconductors, we will discuss the mechanism of superconductivity in heavy-fermion\nmaterials. In Sec. 6, we summarize this review article. In Appendix A, the correct derivation of the\ngeneralized Fermi-liquid theory on the London penetration depth is presented and we provide our picture\nto understand the so-called Uemura plot by taking account of the quasi-particle interaction. In Appendix\nB, the convergence of the perturbation expansion with respect to U is examined by calculating the forthorder terms. The convergence is satisfactorily good for d-wave pairing cases, while for p-wave pairing cases\nTc shows oscillatory behavior depending on the calculated order. By summing up the ladder diagrams\nup to infinite order, we can eliminate this oscillation and recover the convergence also for p-wave pairing\ncase.\n\n\f9\n2. Experimental View\n2.1. Cuprates\nThe discovery of high-Tc cuprates [ 1, 2] was a trigger of the intensive studies on superconductivity in\nstrongly correlated electron systems (SCES). The theoretical efforts stimulated by high-Tc superconductivity have clarified many basic properties of strongly correlated materials. Especially the understanding\nof the quasi-two-dimensional system has been developed.\nHigh-Tc cuprates have the perovskite-type crystal structure and the parent compounds are the Mott\ninsulators with anti-ferromagnetic (AF) order. Carrier doping into this Mott insulating state induces\nhigh-Tc superconductivity, which essentially occurs in the two-dimensional (2D) CuO2 plane. Note here\nthat both hole and electron dopings induce superconductivity [ 23]. From the early stage of the research,\nhigh-Tc cuprates have been recognized to be one of SCES [ 24, 25]. Now the cuprate is confirmed to be the\nmost established unconventional superconductor. Namely, it is predominantly believed that Cooper-pairs\nwith dx2 \u2212y2 -wave symmetry originates from the electronic mechanism. We can understand also several\nnormal-state anomalous properties such as T -linear electric resistivity [ 26] and strongly enhanced AF\nspin correlation [ 27], considering the effect of strong electron correlation. In the following, we survey\nthese experimental results on unconventional superconductivity and anomalous normal-state properties\nin high-Tc cuprates.\n2.1.1. Symmetry of Cooper-pair\nFirst let us see the results on pairing symmetry, since the symmetry of the Cooper-pair is an important\nissue to consider the superconducting mechanism. The non-s wave pairing is a direct evidence for the\nunconventional superconductivity. According to the crystal symmetry of the square lattice composed of\ncopper and oxygen ions, the pairing symmetry is classified as s-wave, dx2 \u2212y2 -wave, dxy -wave, and so on.\nAmong them, in the theoretical point of view, the appearance of the conventional s-wave superconductivity is suppressed, because the strong on-site repulsion easily destroys the s-wave pairing. In fact, the\ntheoretical studies on the electron correlation have predicted the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave symmetry: For instance, in\nthe literatures, we find several works based on the RPA [ 28, 29], scaling theory [ 30, 31, 32], variational\nmethod [ 33, 34], and quantum Monte Carlo simulation [ 35]. In 80's, however, the many experimental results supported the s-wave symmetry. Only a few experiments including the NMR measurement\nhave supported the d-wave superconductivity [ 27]. This discrepancy has been clearly resolved by the\nintensive investigations in 90's, which have demonstrated the various evidence for the anisotropic gap\nstructure with line node [ 36, 37, 38, 39]. Some deviations from the clean d-wave superconductivity has\nbeen explained by taking account of the strong impurity scattering [ 40]. Finally, the phase-sensitive\nmeasurements have clearly confirmed the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave symmetry [ 41, 42, 43]. Nowadays the momentum\ndependence of the excitation gap is directly observed in the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES), where the line node appears in the diagonal direction of kx = ky [ 44, 45, 46, 47].\nOn the other hand, the pairing symmetry in electron-doped systems has not been settled for a long\ntime, because node-less behaviors were reported by several groups [ 48]. However, recent experiments\nhave finally concluded that the electron-doped systems are also the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave superconductors [ 49,\n50, 51, 52, 53]. Also in this case, crucial roles have been played by the phase-sensitive measurement [\n51] and ARPES [ 52, 53]. These results seem to be natural, since from the theoretical point of view,\nthe same pairing mechanism is expected both for hole- and electron-doped materials. Note, however,\nthat interesting particle-hole asymmetry has been found in some aspects. For instance, in electron-doped\nsystems, we have observed that (i) the transition temperature is relatively low, (ii) the superconducting\nregion in the phase diagram is narrow, and (iii) the AF order is robust in comparison with hole-doped\ncompounds. Later in this review, this asymmetry will be discussed in our theoretical approach by\nconsidering the detailed electronic structure.\nNow we can conclude that the issues on the paring symmetry in high-Tc cuprates have been settled. In\nthe next stage, the following two issues are especially important. One is, of course, the pairing mechanism\nfor high-Tc cuprates. This theoretical subject will be discussed in Sec. 3. Particularly we focus on the\nintensive studies from the microscopic point of view, which have opened a new way to understand the\nsuperconductivity in SCES. Another issue is to explain the anomalous properties in the normal state,\nwhich is one of the main points of this review. This subject will be discussed in detail in Sec. 4 with\nour main interests on the pseudogap phenomena. As for the latter problem, intensive experimental\n\n\f10\n\nFigure 1.

Thus, here we\nsurvey the experimental results on the normal-state properties in the following subsections [ 54].\n2.1.2. Phase diagram\nBefore proceeding to the review of normal-state properties of high-Tc cuprates, it is instructive to\nexplain first the outline of the T -\u03b4 phase diagram. Both the theoretical and experimental investigations\nhave been focussed on the hole-doped systems, but recently, the electron-doped systems also have been\nstudied intensively. Then, the whole phase diagram as shown in Fig. 1 has been clarified. Let us see some\ncharacteristic points of this phase diagram in the following.\nIn general, the properties of high-Tc cuprates are controlled by the carrier doping concentration \u03b4,\nwhich is defined as \u03b4=1\u2212n and n is the carrier number per copper site. The system is the AF Mott\ninsulator at half-filling (\u03b4=0) and the AF order is easily destroyed by the slight amount of hole-doping\n(\u03b4>0). Then, there appears the metallic phase with the superconducting ground state. The transition\ntemperature Tc takes its maximum value (\u223c100K) at the optimally-doped region (\u03b4\u223c0.15) and decreases\nin the over-doped region.\nHere it is stressed that anomalous behaviors in the normal-state properties are significant from the\noptimally-doped to the under-doped region, although the meaning of \"anomalous behavior\" will be discussed in detail in the following subsections. As indicated by thin and thick dashed curves in Fig. 1,\nthere exist two characteristic temperatures, determined from the several experimental results. One is\nT0 , shown by the thin dashed curve, a temperature at which the AF spin correlation begins to develop\nwith decreasing temperature. For instance, the NMR 1/T1 T and Hall coefficient RH increase from the\ntemperature T0 . Another characteristic temperature is T \u2217 , indicated by the thick dashed curve. This is\na temperature for the onset of the opening of pseudogap, observed in ARPES, NMR 1/T1 T , tunnelling\nmeasurements, and so on. The enormous investigations have been dedicated to the clarification of the\npseudogap because this issue has been regarded as a central problem in high-Tc superconductors. Note\nthat these experiments have indicated some similarities between the pseudogap and superconducting gap.\nWe consider that the SC fluctuation becomes apparent around T =T \u2217. As shown in Sec. 4, our interests\non the pseudogap phenomena are concerned with this lower cross-over curve. Note also that somewhat\nuncertainty may be included in the definitions of T0 and T \u2217 , since two curves just denote the cross-over\ntemperatures, not the phase transition. Nevertheless, we believe that the above classifications are useful\nto understand the anomalous properties in a coherent way.\nAs already mentioned, the electron-doped systems (\u03b4<0) are also superconducting. However, some\ndifferent features from hole-doped ones are observed, as explained in the previous subsection. For instance,\nthe AF order is robust for the carrier doping in these systems and superconductivity occurs in the narrow\ndoping region with relatively low transition temperature. Especially, in the normal metallic state, the\npseudogap phenomena and the under-doped region have not been observed in electron-doped systems. In\nSecs. 3 and 4, we provide our understanding of the phase diagram including this particle-hole asymmetry.\n\n\f11\n\nFigure 2. The experimental data of the NMR 1/T1 T [ 55].\n\n2.1.3. Magnetic properties\nAs is well known, NMR and neutron scattering measurements are the powerful methods to investigate\nspin correlations. These experiments have played crucial roles to reveal that the magnetic properties in\nthe high-Tc cuprates are \"anomalous\" in many aspects. Here let us summarize these anomalous behaviors\nin the normal state.\nFirst we emphasize that the pseudogap phenomenon has been first discovered in the NMR measurements [ 55]. As shown in Fig. 2, the spin-lattice relaxation rate over temperature 1/T1 T exhibits the\npeak around T = T \u2217 and it begins to decrease below T \u2217 . This is a typical pseudogap behavior observed in 1/T1 T , indicating the suppression of magnetic excitations in the low-energy part. The detailed\ninvestigations have subsequently observed this phenomenon in most of the under-doped compounds [\n55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64] and the doping dependence of T \u2217 is found to be consistent with\nFig. 1.\nIn the conventional metal well described by the Fermi-liquid theory, 1/T1 T should be a constant for the\ntemperature higher than Tc . On the other hand, in high-Tc cuprates, 1/T1 T is not constant for T > Tc .\nRather, the Curie-Weiss law 1/T1T \u221d(T + \u03b8)\u22121 has been observed for T >T \u2217 [ 27, 65], where \u03b8 is a Weiss\ntemperature. This fact clearly indicates that strong spin fluctuations exist in high-Tc cuprates. Note\nthat this spin fluctuation has anti-ferromagnetic nature [ 66], since the ratio (1/T1 T )/K 2 is larger by one\norder than the usual value of the Korringa law, where K is the NMR Knight shift. For Tc < T < T \u2217 ,\nas explained above, 1/T1 T begins to decrease even before the system becomes superconducting. Since\nthose behaviors are significantly different from the results in the conventional Fermi-liquid theory, they\nare regarded to be anomalous normal-state properties. Note that the Curie-Weiss law itself can be\nexplained by the self-consistent renormalization (SCR) theory [ 8], which is one of the spin fluctuation\ntheory. However, it is difficult to understand the anomalous temperature dependence including pseudogap\nbehavior only from the spin fluctuation theory.\nThe NMR Knight shift K is proportional to the uniform spin susceptibility K \u221d \u03c7(0, 0). Although the\nKnight shift satisfies the Korringa-relation K 2 \u221d 1/T1 T in usual metals, in high-Tc cuprates, it shows\na different temperature dependence from the Korringa-relation. Namely, the Knight shift gradually\ndecreases below T0 [ 57, 67, 68]. This behavior has been observed also in the uniform susceptibility [\n69, 70]. Concerning the pseudogap, the Knight shift also shows an anomaly around T \u2217 ; the decrease\nbecomes rapid below T \u2217 , as observed in Fig. 3 [ 64].\nThe spin-echo decay rate 1/T2G measures the momentum summation of the square of the static spin\nsusceptibility (see Eq. (93)). The experiments in early years have shown that the NMR 1/T2G keep\nincreasing below T \u2217 [ 58, 59, 61]. However, the recent experiments have revealed the different behavior\ndepending on the number of CuO2 layers [ 60, 62, 63, 71, 72]. This difference is probably attributed to\nthe effect of the interlayer coupling [ 63, 71]. It is important to note that the 1/T2G decreases below T \u2217\nin the single layer compounds [ 60, 62, 63, 71]. Then, the decrease of 1/T2G is weaker than that of 1/T1 T .\nNow we turn our attentions to the neutron scattering experiments, in which the wave vector of the spin\nfluctuation can be directly observed by measuring the form factor in proportion to the imaginary part\nof dynamical spin susceptibility, Im\u03c7(q, \u03c9). In high-Tc cuprates, the peak of the spin-spin correlation\nfunction is located around q=(\u03c0, \u03c0) [ 73]. The peak position depends both on the temperature and\ndoping concentration, but interestingly enough, it can be incommensurate as q6=(\u03c0, \u03c0) in some materials\n\n\f12\n\nFigure 3. The experimental data of the Knight shift [ 64].\n\nFigure 4. The experimental data of the dynamical spin susceptibility at the anti-ferromagnetic wave\nvector Im\u03c7(Q, \u03c9) [ 82].\n\n[ 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80]. The interesting temperature dependence of this incommensurability has been\nobserved and discussed in relation with a stripe order [ 77, 78], which is found in La-based compounds\naround \u03b4=1/8 [ 81]. We will comment on this problem in Sec. 4.3.3. Note that in the spin fluctuation\ntheory, the detailed structure in spin correlation function is not important, since the main part of the\nmagnetic excitation always locates around q=(\u03c0, \u03c0).\nThe pseudogap is clearly observed also in the spectral weight of the spin fluctuation, which is directly\nmeasured by the neutron scattering experiments. The spectral weight in the low frequency part is\nsuppressed and at the same time, it is shifted to the high frequency part, as shown in Fig. 4 [ 82]. This\nfrequency dependence is anomalous in comparison with the results of the conventional Fermi-liquid theory\nand also those of the spin fluctuation theory. As will be discussed in Sec. 4.3.3, this behavior means that\na new energy scale appears in the pseudogap state. We will attribute it to the energy scale due to the\nsuperconductivity.\n2.1.4. Transport properties\nIn the previous subsection, anomalous behaviors in magnetic properties have been briefly reviewed,\nbut transport properties are also anomalous in comparison with the conventional Fermi-liquid theory. In\nthis subsection, let us see anomalous features of in-plane electric resistivity \u03c1ab , Hall coefficient RH , and\nc-axis resistivity \u03c1c .\nIt is well known that the Fermi-liquid theory predicts the T 2 -law for the electric resistivity in the lowtemperature region, but in optimally- and under-doped region of high-Tc cuprates, it has been observed\nthat \u03c1ab \u221d T , [ 26, 83] as shown in Fig. 5. However, when the amount of doping concentration is further\nincreased, the temperature dependence in the in-plane resistivity gradually changes and eventually the\nT 2 -law recovers in the over-doped region [ 10]. This crossover behavior in the temperature dependence\nof the in-plane resistivity is well described by the nearly anti-ferromagnetic Fermi-liquid theory, as will\nbe explained in Sec. 4.3.4 [ 84, 85, 86].\nIn the pseudogap state, a characteristic behavior can be observed in the in-plane resistivity. Namely, it\nchanges its slope at T \u2217 and slightly deviates downward [ 87, 88, 89]. This rather weak deviation has been\n\n\f13\n\nFigure 5. The experimental data of the in-plane resistivity [ 89].\n\nFigure 6. The experimental data of the Hall coefficient [ 87].\n\none of the puzzling issues among anomalous normal-state properties of high-Tc cuprates. The transport\nproperties are generally insensitive to the pseudogap in comparison with the magnetic properties [ 26].\nTherefore, the pseudogap was sometimes called \"spin gap\", in the sense that the gap occurs only in the\nspin excitations. These properties were complicated and difficult to understand, but it is now consistently\nexplained by including simultaneously the spin and superconducting fluctuations, as will be described in\nSec. 4.3.4 [ 90].\nIn the conventional Fermi-liquid, the Hall coefficient RH is independent of T , while in high-Tc cuprates,\nit strongly depends on the temperature, as show in Fig. 6 [ 26, 87, 91, 92]. Moreover, in the under-doped\nregion, the Hall coefficient takes much larger value than that expected from the band-structure calculation\nresults. As seen in the in-plane resistivity, these anomalous behaviors gradually change to those in\nthe conventional Fermi-liquid in the over-doped region. The enhanced Hall coefficient was sometimes\ninterpreted as an evidence for the low-carrier density n, because the relation RH \u221d 1/n is derived in the\nisotropic electron system. However, this interpretation is just a superficial expectation in the anisotropic\nsystem such as the Hubbard model on the square lattice (see Sec. 4.3.4). In fact, the enhanced Hall\ncoefficient has been explained within the nearly AF Fermi-liquid theory [ 93, 94].\nIn the pseudogap state, the Hall coefficient remarkably deviates downward and decreases with temperature [ 87, 88, 91, 95, 96]. The anomaly around T \u2217 is much clearer than that in the resistivity. A theory\nbased on the d-wave superconducting (SC) fluctuation alone expects the enhancement of the Hall coefficient [ 97]. We will also show that this discrepancy can be resolved by the simultaneous consideration of\nAF and SC fluctuations (Sec. 4.3.4).\nAnother interesting property of high-Tc cuprates is the strongly anisotropic transport, originating from\nthe layered structure. Typically the ratio of the c-axis and in-plane resistivity, \u03c1c /\u03c1ab , increases in the\nunder-doped and/or low-temperature region [ 26, 98]. Moreover, the pseudogap remarkably enhances the\nc-axis resistivity [ 98]. This response to the pseudogap, qualitatively different from that of the in-plane\nresistivity, can be explained by considering the d-wave SC fluctuation combined with the characteristic\nband structure [ 97, 99] (see Sec. 4.3.4).\nThe c-axis optical conductivity \u03c3c (\u03c9) shows no Drude peak in the under-doped region [ 100, 101, 102],\nwhich is consistent with the incoherent nature of the c-axis resistivity. As will be explained in Sec. 4.3.4,\n\n\f14\n\nFigure 7. The results of the ARPES [ 105].\n\nowing to the momentum dependence of the c-axis hopping matrix, the coherent transport along the caxis is disturbed by the pseudogap. The gap structure appears in \u03c3c (\u03c9) in the pseudogap state. This\npseudogap smoothly changes to the SC gap and this behavior indicates the close relation between the\npseudogap and the SC gap.\n2.1.5. Spectroscopy\nThe ARPES directly measures the single-particle spectral weight at the selected momentum. Therefore,\nmany pieces of clear information on the single-particle excitation can be obtained, while some cares are\nrequired for the resolution. Especially, the ARPES has provided us an important suggestion on the\npseudogap phenomena [ 103, 104, 105, 106], such as the leading edge gap observed above Tc , as shown\nin Fig. 7. This experimental result indicates the suppression of the single-particle spectral weight near\nthe Fermi energy, which clarifies following two important natures of the pseudogap: (i) The momentum\ndependence of the pseudogap is similar to that of the SC gap, i.e., the pseudogap has the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave\nform. (ii) The magnitude of the pseudogap does not change through the superconducting transition.\nBelow Tc , the coherent quasi-particle peak appears at the gap edge, and the gap structure becomes sharp\nwith keeping its magnitude. These results have clearly suggested the close relation between the pseudogap\nphenomena and superconductivity, leading to the pairing scenarios in which the pseudogap is a precursor\nof superconductivity (see Sec. 4.1).\nNote that the qualitatively same suggestion has been obtained from the tunneling spectroscopy which\nmeasures the electronic density of states (DOS). The suppression of the DOS near the Fermi level is\nobserved above Tc [ 107, 108, 109]. The magnitude of the pseudogap in the DOS is nearly the same\n(slightly larger) as that of the SC gap. Again we observe that the gap structure becomes sharp below Tc .\nThe measurements of the SC gap at T \u226a Tc have revealed that the SC gap increases in the under-doped\nregion in spite of the decrease in Tc [ 110, 89]. If we ignore quantum fluctuations, the SC gap at T = 0\nis in proportion to the transition temperature in the mean field theory TcMF , which is increased with the\ndecrease of the amount of doping even in the under-doped region. It is expected that the thermal SC\nfluctuation suppresses Tc in the under-doped region, since it should become strong with the decrease of\n\u03b4.\nConcerning the cross-over around T = T0 , both the tunneling spectroscopy [ 107, 108, 109] and the\nARPES [ 111] have observed the slight and broad suppression of the DOS from T = T0 . This suppression\nis called \"large pseudogap\" and its energy scale is 3 \u223c 4 times larger than the SC gap. The large pseudogap\nshould not be attributed to the precursor of superconductivity, and may have somewhat magnetic origin.\nThe pseudogap below T \u2217 is sometimes called \"small pseudogap\" in contrast with the large pseudogap.\n2.1.6. Magnetic field penetration depth\nFinally in this subsection, let us discuss the magnetic field penetration depth which is identical to\nthe London penetration depth \u03bbL in the type II limit. This is not the quantity in the normal state,\nbut it indicates an interesting property in the SC state. The doping dependence of the magnetic field\npenetration depth at T =0 is known as \"Uemura plot\" [ 112, 113]. The London constant \u039b=1/4\u03c0\u03bb2L is\nroughly proportional to the hole-doping and Tc (\u039b \u221d \u03b4 \u221d Tc ) in the under-doped region. This constant\nshows a peak around the optimally-doping and decreases with doping in the over-doped region [ 114].\nThe London constant is sometimes expressed by the \"superfluid density\" ns as \u039b=ns /m\u2217 , where m\u2217 is\n\n\f15\n\nFigure 8. Schematic phase diagram of \u03ba-(ET)2 X compounds.\n\nthe effective mass of carrier. We focus on the London constant instead of the superfluid density in order\nto avoid any confusion, since it will be shown that the superfluid density is not related to the electron\ndensity. The London constant corresponds to the stiffness of the superconducting phase variable, which\nis generally related to the SC fluctuation in the ordered state. The Uemura plot exhibits that the phase\nfluctuation is softened in the under-doped region. It has been proposed along this line that the phase\ndisordered state is a possible pseudogap state [ 115].\nThe temperature dependence of the London constant has also attracted much interests. The London\nconstant exhibits T -linear dependence as \u039b(T )=\u039b(0) \u2212 aT in the low-temperature region [ 39, 113, 116],\nwhich is a characteristic behavior of the d-wave superconductor. This T -linear law reflects the nodal\nquasi-particles around k = (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2). Interestingly, the coefficient a is almost independent of the doping\nconcentration in sharp contrast to the drastic change of \u039b(0) [ 113]. These anomalous behaviors have\nmuch stimulated theoretical insights [ 117, 118]. In order to provide a systematic understanding for the\nanomalous behaviors, we will explain the microscopic derivation of the London constant based on the\nFermi-liquid theory, as shown in Appendix [ 119, 120]. Then, it is emphasized that the Fermi-liquid\ncorrection as well as the reduced symmetry in the square lattice plays an essential role [ 118].\nThe c-axis London constant is much smaller than the in-plane one and the anisotropy \u039bc /\u039b is reduced\nwith under-doping [ 113, 116]. These behaviors are consistent with the transport properties in the normal\nstate. The power of the temperature dependence of \u039bc is larger than unity in the low-temperature region [\n113, 116]. The origin of this nature is in common with the incoherent c-axis conductance in the pseudogap\nstate. Note that in the clean limit T 5 -law is expected, but sample dependence is frequently observed,\nprobably owing to the effect of disorder.\nThe London constant just below Tc shows a rapid growth rather than that obtained in the BCS theory\n[ 116, 121]. This is regarded as an appearance of the critical fluctuation. The critical behavior of the\n3D-XY universality class has been confirmed [ 121]. This clear appearance of the SC fluctuation supports\nthe pairing scenario on the pseudogap phenomena. The growth of \u039bc below Tc is more rapid than that\nof \u039b [ 116]. This is also because of the momentum dependence of the inter-layer hopping matrix.\n2.2. Organic Superconductor\nAs mentioned in the introductory section, the discovery of organic superconductor (TMTSF)2 PF6 [ 5]\nhas made a great impact on the community of superconductivity. The intensive exploitation in this field\nhas revealed a universality of superconducting phenomena and attached much interests on the physical\naspects of the organic materials [ 122]. Among them, one of the most interesting superconductors is \u03ba-type\n(BEDT-TTF)2 X. In the following, it is expressed as \u03ba-(ET)2 X for an abbreviation. These compounds\nhave quasi-two-dimensional electronic structures, which have been confirmed by the Shubnikov-de Haas\nexperiments [ 123] and by the strong anisotropy in the electronic transport [ 124]. The conduction band is\nmainly constructed from ET molecules. A simplified model for the electronic state can be constructed by\nnoting the molecular \u03c0-orbitals (see Sec. 3.3.1), although the ET molecule has a complicated structure.\n\u03ba-(ET)2 X compounds are one of the central objects in this area, because of their typical features as\nSCES. The typical phase diagram is shown in Fig. 8. We have two ordered phases by tuning the pressure\nP . One is the AF insulating state in the lower pressure region and the other is superconducting phase\nin the higher pressure region [ 125, 126]. It should be noticed that the superconductivity occurs when\n\n\f16\nthe AF order disappears. The transition temperature decreases with increasing P . It is true that this\nphase diagram includes similar aspects to that of high-Tc cuprates, but several differences are observed.\nFirst, the phase transition from the AF to the SC state is the first order. Second, the carrier number\nin the conduction band is always half-filling per dimer, independent of the control parameter P . The\npressure widens the band width W and thus, it controls the parameter U/W . The decrease in U/W\nby the pressure has been confirmed by many experimental facts. For instance, the resistivity becomes\nsmaller together with the superconducting Tc [ 125, 126, 127]. Therefore, the Mott transition in these\ncompounds is regarded to be \"band width controlled\", which is contrasted with the \"filling controlled\"\nMott transition, as observed in cuprate superconductors [ 128].\nA series of these compounds have different properties at ambient pressure due to the kinds of anions\nX: \u03ba-(ET)2 Cu[N(CN)2 ]Cl is the AF insulator [ 129]. The deuterated \u03ba-(ET)2 Cu[N(CN)2 ]Br is located\non the boundary between the two phases [ 130]. \u03ba-(ET)2 Cu[N(CN)2 ]Br and \u03ba-(ET)2 Cu(NCS)2 show the\nsuperconductivity at the ambient pressure. This systematic change due to X is regarded as an effect of\nthe chemical pressure, as described in the phase diagram of Fig. 8.\nIt is predominantly believed with a few objections that the d-wave superconductivity occurs in these\ncompounds like high-Tc cuprates. NMR experiments again have played an important role in the identification of the pairing symmetry [ 131, 132, 133]. The measurements below Tc have shown (i) no coherence\npeak, (ii) the decrease of the Knight shift, and (iii) T 3 -law of the NMR 1/T1 in the low-temperature\nregion. From these results, the singlet pairing with line node has been suggested. The same conclusion\nis obtained by the measurement of the electronic specific heat, which is proportional to T 2 at low temperature [ 134]. These results indicate that the pairing symmetry is not the s-wave, but probably the\nd-wave.\nThe highest Tc among \u03ba-(ET)2 X compounds is about 13K. From the theoretical point of view, this\nvalue is the same order as that of cuprate superconductors, when Tc is scaled by the band-width. In\ngeneral, organic materials have smaller band-width by an order, because they are constructed from the\nmolecular orbitals. The scaling between Tc and W have suggested a similar pairing mechanism to the\nhigh-Tc cuprates. We will review in detail the theoretical results in Sec. 3.3.\nFinally, we note that the similarity between organic and high-Tc superconductors should be extended\nto the anomalous properties in the normal state. In particular, the pseudogap has been also observed\nin the NMR 1/T1T [ 135, 136] with T \u2217 \u223c50K. However, it is an important difference that T \u2217 is much\nhigher than Tc and the electronic state is almost incoherent above T \u2217 . Thus, the different nature around\nT \u2217 is expected. As will be discussed in Sec. 4.2.4, however, the similar properties in the electronic state\nindicate the manifestation of the pseudogap with the same origin. Recently, Kanoda's group has given\na clear understanding on this problem [ 137] by measuring the magnetic field dependence of the NMR\n1/T1 T ; the SC fluctuation appears from the new cross-over temperature Tc\u2217 which is between Tc and T \u2217 .\nThe electronic state below Tc\u2217 is regarded as the pseudogap state induced by the SC fluctuation as in the\nunder-doped cuprates. The details will be discussed in Sec. 4.2.4.\n2.3. Sr2 RuO4\nSuperconductivity in Sr2 RuO4 has been discovered by Maeno et al. in 1994 [ 3] and the intrinsic Tc\nis now considered to be as large as 1.5K in the high purity sample. This compound possesses the same\ncrystal structure as La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 , one of the high-Tc superconductors, and it similarly has the quasi\ntwo-dimensional nature. For example, the resistivity exhibits a large anisotropy; the ratio \u03c1c /\u03c1ab is in\nthe order of several hundreds [ 3, 138]. The quantum oscillation measurement has also clearly shown\nthe quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surfaces [ 139]. Then, RuO2 layers are expected to be essential for the\nmetallic behavior and superconductivity, as CuO2 layers in high-Tc cuprates.\nIn contrast to cuprates, Sr2 RuO4 is considered to be an ideal two-dimensional Fermi-liquid [ 138],\nsince there is no anomalous behavior in the normal state. Since Tc is much lower than that of cuprates\nand \u03ba-(ET)2 X, the superconductivity is easily destroyed by the small perturbation or disorder. For\nruthenate it is difficult to find, at least at present, a well-defined controlling parameter for the appearance\nof the superconductivity such as doping in cuprates. Thus, our interest is here focused only on the\nsuperconductivity in Sr2 RuO4 .\nAccording to the first-principle band-structure calculations [ 140, 141], it has been clarified that the\nelectronic states near the Fermi level mainly consist of the Ru4d\u03b5 orbitals, although the Ru4d\u03b5 and O2p\norbitals hybridize with each other. Since it is expected that electrons strongly correlate through Coulomb\n\n\f17\ninteractions at Ru sites, Sr2 RuO4 belongs to a class of SCES. In fact, the Mott insulating state has been\nfound in the related compound Ca2 RuO4 [ 142], suggesting the importance of strong correlation effect.\nCompared to the other compounds focused in this review, Sr2 RuO4 has somewhat different nature\nboth in the electronic structure and in the superconducting properties. One interesting issue is that this\ncompound is a multi-band system. The quantum oscillation measurement has shown three quasi-twodimensional Fermi surfaces, which are defined as \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 sheets [ 139]. Note that the observed Fermi\nsurfaces are in good agreement with the first-principle band-structure calculation results [ 140, 141] and\nthe recent ARPES measurement [ 143]. Another remarkable difference from cuprates and \u03ba-(ET)2 X is\nthe electron filling. Since the valence of ruthenium ion is Ru4+ , four electrons occupy Ru-site on the\naverage. Again according to the quantum oscillation measurement, about 4/3 electrons are included in\nthe \u03b3 band and remained part is included in \u03b1 and \u03b2 bands. Thus, it is regarded that this system is far\nfrom the half-filling.\nThe most outstanding and interesting difference is the pairing symmetry, which has recently been\nclarified to be spin-triplet due to excellent experiments [ 144]. The most important experimental evidence\nsuggesting the spin-triplet pairing has been obtained by NMR [ 4, 145]. Ishida et al. have measured the\n17\nO-NMR and Ru Knight shift by applying the magnetic field parallel to the ab-plane, and observed\nno suppression in the spin susceptibility below Tc [ 4, 145]. This result excludes the possibility of the\nspin-singlet pairing, and at the same time, indicates the d-vector along the \u1e91-axis. The d-vector is\nan usual expression for the internal degree of freedom, which is an interesting subject in the triplet\nsuperconductivity [ 12, 146]. Recent inelastic polarized neutron scattering experiment has suggested the\nsame results [ 147].\nNow the spin-triplet pairing in ruthenate has been experimentally confirmed. Slight portion of nonmagnetic impurities drastically suppresses the superconductivity [ 148], in sharp contrast to the impurity\neffects in conventional s-wave superconductors. The NMR and NQR relaxation rates exhibit no coherence\npeak just below Tc [ 149, 150]. The \u03bcSR measurement has shown that an internal magnetic field is\nspontaneously turned on below Tc [ 151], indicating that the time-reversal symmetry is broken in the\nSC state of ruthenate. From this result, the chiral state d\u02c6 = (kx \u00b1 iky )\u1e91 has been suggested [ 152]. The\ntemperature dependence of the critical current in Pb/Sr2 RuO4 /Pb junction is also consistent with the\np-wave pairing state [ 153].\nTheoretically, Rice and Sigrist pointed out a possibility of spin-triplet superconductivity, immediately\nafter the discovery of superconductivity in Sr2 RuO4 [ 154]. Their insights have been based on the\nfollowing facts. First some Fermi-liquid parameters are similar to those of 3 He, which is confirmed to\nbe a spin-triplet p-wave superfluid [ 146]. Second the three-dimensional analogous compound SrRuO3\nexhibits the ferromagnetism with a Curie temperature TC = 160K. They have considered that the Hund's\nrule coupling among Ru4d\u03b5 orbitals stabilizes the spin-triplet pairing rather than the spin-singlet one.\nAlthough any microscopic justification for above two insights has not yet been obtained up to now, their\nexcellent prediction itself has obtained a great success.\nAt the present stage, the theoretical interests on Sr2 RuO4 are focused on the two fundamental aspects\nof superconductivity, namely the pairing symmetry and the pairing mechanism. Concerning the pairing\nsymmetry, the origin of the power-law behaviors is a challenging subject. As is mentioned above, the chiral\nstate without time-reversal symmetry is expected for the internal degree of freedom. Then, assuming the\nsimple momentum dependence of the SC gap, for instance, \u2206(k) \u221d sin kx [ 155], the excitation gap opens\non the whole Fermi surface. On the contrary, the gap-less power-law behaviors, suggesting the existence of\nthe line node, have been observed in common among the several experimental results on the specific heat\n[ 156], NMR 1/T1T [ 150], magnetic field penetration depth [ 157], thermal conductivity [ 158, 159], and\nultrasonic attenuation rate [ 160]. We should note that only the point node is derived from the symmetry\nargument, even if the three-dimensional degree of freedom is taken into account [ 161]. Thus, if we\nassume the chiral state, the line node should appear only accidentally. Namely, the theoretical proposal\non this problem has to rely on somewhat an accidental reason. Among them, the three-dimensional\nf -wave symmetry [ 162, 163] has been supported by the thermal conductivity measurement [ 159, 164].\nThe more improved proposal based on the multi-band effect has been proposed along this line [ 165].\nThe essential assumption of this proposal is that the zeros of the order parameter corresponding to the\nsymmetry \u2206(k) \u221d kx is parallel to the plane. When the zeros have a slope, the point node is expected.\nThe pairing state assumed here is generally difficult in view of the pairing mechanism, because the\n\n\f18\nFermi surface of Sr2 RuO4 is clearly two-dimensional. Therefore, we consider that this problem should\nbe resolved within the two-dimensional model. We will provide a different proposal along this line on\nthe basis of the microscopic theory (see Sec. 3.4.2). Then, the node-like structure appears in the \u03b2 band.\nThis is also an \"accident\", but derived from the microscopic model. The power-law behaviors can be\nexplained, although a fitting of the parameters is required.\nThe advances in the theoretical studies on the pairing mechanism will be reviewed in Sec. 3.4.1. Since\nthis issue is one of the main subjects of this review, we will discuss it in detail. Then, we show the\nresults of the microscopic investigation based on the perturbation theory in Sec. 3.4.2. Subsequently, the\nmicroscopic mechanism of stabilizing the chiral state will be investigated in Sec. 3.4.3. The microscopic\nstudy on the internal degree of freedom becomes possible owing to the relatively simple electronic state.\nFinally we mention that such study was very difficult previously because triplet superconductors were\nbasically observed only in the heavy-fermion compound. We close this section by noting that the discovery\nof Sr2 RuO4 has accelerated the theoretical understanding on the triplet superconductivity.\n\n\f19\n3. Microscopic Mechanism of Superconductivity\nIn this section, we review the theoretical investigations on the mechanism of unconventional superconductivity based on the microscopic Hamiltonian such as the single- and multi-band Hubbard model.\nBefore discussing the particular superconductors, in order to make this review article self-contained, in\nSec. 3.1 we briefly explain the theoretical tools which will be used in the following subsections. Readers\nwho may not be interested in the theoretical formulation can simply skip this subsection. In Sec. 3.2, highTc superconductivity will be discussed in detail. The basic properties and typical results of microscopic\ntheories will be reviewed. The application to the organic superconductor is discussed in Sec. 3.3. Then,\nthe applicability of the microscopic theory for the molecular materials are clearly shown. In Sec. 3.4,\nthe microscopic theory is extended to the triplet superconductivity in Sr2 RuO4 , where the qualitatively\ndifferent results are derived from the characteristic electronic structure.\n3.1. Dyson-Gor'kov Equation\nIn the following subsections, the Dyson-Gor'kov equation and \u00c9liashberg theory [ 166] are used to\ndiscuss superconductivity. This formulation is suitable for the diagrammatic techniques in the quantum\nfield theory, although some approximations are usually needed for the actual calculations. However, this\napproach is effective to clarify the physical picture and in principle, it is free from the finite size effect,\ncompared with the numerical methods. This subsection is devoted to the introduction of the linearized\n\u00c9liashberg theory, which is used to determine the superconducting transition. For simplicity, we show\nthe explicit expressions only for the single-band case, but the extension to the multi-band system is\nstraightforward.\nIn the Dyson-Gor'kov equation, the superconducting state is described by introducing the normal and\nanomalous Green functions, symbolically expressed as G and F , respectively [ 17]. In the homogeneous\nsystem, they are defined as\nZ \u03b2\nd\u03c4 ei\u03c9n \u03c4 hT\u03c4 ck\u03c3 (\u03c4 )c\u2020k\u03c3 i,\n(1)\nG(k, i\u03c9n ) = \u2212\n0\n\nF (k, i\u03c9n ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03b2\n\n0\n\nF \u2020 (k, i\u03c9n ) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nd\u03c4 ei\u03c9n \u03c4 hT\u03c4 ck\u2191 (\u03c4 )c\u2212k\u2193 i,\n\n\u03b2\n\nd\u03c4 ei\u03c9n \u03c4 hT\u03c4 c\u2020\u2212k\u2193 (\u03c4 )c\u2020k\u2191 i,\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nwhere ck\u03c3 (\u03c4 )=eH\u03c4 ck\u03c3 e\u2212H\u03c4 with a Hamiltonian H, ck\u03c3 is an annihilation operator for electron with spin\n\u03c3 and momentum k, \u03b2=1/T , and \u03c9n =\u03c0T (2n + 1) with an integer n is a fermion Matsubara frequency.\nThe symbol h* * * i means the operation to take statistical average and T\u03c4 is an ordering operator with\nrespect to \u03c4 . Note that the following formulation is common to the singlet and triplet pairing cases unless\nwe explicitly mention.\nThe Green functions are expressed by normal and anomalous self-energies through the Dyson-Gor'kov\nequation, diagrammatically expressed in Fig. 9. Readers can find a clear derivation of the Dyson-Gor'kov\nequation in Ref. [ 17] and more general expression for the inhomogeneous state in Ref. [ 167]. The\nnormal and anomalous self-energies are exactly obtained from the Gor'kov equation [ 168, 167] in the\nhomogeneous case through the Fourier transformation and the Dyson-Gor'kov equation is written in the\nmatrix form as\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012 (0) \u22121\n\u0013\u22121\nG(k)\nF (k)\nG (k) \u2212 \u03a3n (k)\n\u2206(k)\n=\n.\n(4)\nF \u2020 (k) \u2212G(\u2212k)\n\u2206\u2217 (k)\n\u2212G(0) (\u2212k)\u22121 + \u03a3n (\u2212k)\nHere, \u03a3n (k) and \u2206(k) are the normal and anomalous self-energies, respectively, G(0) (k) is the noninteracting Green function, given by G(0) (k)=[i\u03c9n \u2212 \u03b5(k)]\u22121 , \u03b5(k) is the one-electron dispersion energy,\nand k is a shorthand notation as k=(k, i\u03c9n). Note that a chemical potential is included in \u03b5(k) in our\nnotation.\nThe normal and anomalous self-energies can be expressed by the perturbation series, which is obtained\nin a usual manner [ 17]. Since an approximation is usually required for an explicit estimation, we will\nintroduce three approximations such as third-order perturbation (TOP), random phase approximation\n(RPA), and fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation, as will be explained later in detail. In the other\n\n\f20\n\nFigure 9. Diagrammatic representation of the Dyson-Gor'kov equation.\n\nFigure 10. (a) The one-loop approximation for \u2206(k) in the electron-phonon system. The wavy line\nrepresents the phonon propagator. Diagrammatic representation of (b) the anomalous vertex and (c) the\nanomalous self-energy.\n\nderivation, \u03a3n (k) and \u2206(k) are derived from the functional derivatives using the Luttinger's functional\n\u03a6[G, F \u2020 ] [ 169, 170] as\n\u03a3n (k) =\n\n1 \u03b4\u03a6\n,\n2 \u03b4G(k)\n\n\u2206(k) = \u2212\n\n\u03b4\u03a6\n.\n\u03b4F \u2020 (k)\n\n(5)\n\nThen, the variational conditions about the free energy \u03a9 are satisfied as\n\u03b4\u03a9\n\u03b4\u03a9\n=\n= 0.\n\u03b4\u03a3n (k)\n\u03b4\u2206(k)\n\n(6)\n\nIf above conditions are satisfied, the calculation is called \"conserving approximation\" [ 171]. Note that\nthe perturbation scheme does not necessarily satisfy the above conditions.\nFor the conventional s-wave superconductivity, the anomalous self-energy is obtained by the electronphonon coupling. Since the typical phonon frequency is smaller than the Fermi energy in conventional\nmetals, the Migdal's theorem holds and the vertex corrections can be ignored. Thus, the one-loop\napproximation shown in Fig. 10(a) is valid. In the case of unconventional superconductivity arising from\nelectron correlations, the irreducible vertex Va (k, k \u2032 ) in the particle-particle channel (Fig. 10(b)) is derived\nfrom the many-body effects. In analogy with the electron-phonon mechanism, this vertex is regarded as\nthe effective interaction for the pairing. Thus, the anomalous self-energy, represented formally by the\ndiagram in Fig. 10(c), is expressed by\nX\n\u2206(k) = \u2212\nVa (k, k \u2032 )F (k \u2032 ).\n(7)\nk\u2032\n\nP\nP\nHere the summation is defined as k = (T /N ) k,n , where N is the number of sites. It is considered that\nthe unconventional superconductivity arises from the momentum dependence in the effective interaction\nVa (k, k \u2032 ). The theoretical search for the pairing mechanism is then reduced to the identification of the\neffective interaction.\n\n\f21\nThe expression for the anomalous self-energy Eq. (7) is a self-consistent equation, which is one of the\nmean-field equations. We can reproduce the result of the weak-coupling BCS theory [ 172], if we ignore\nthe normal self-energy as well as the frequency dependence of Va (k, k \u2032 ). The self-consistent equation is\nthen transformed to the gap equation as\n\u2206(k) = \u2212\nE(k) =\n\nX\n\nVa (k, k\u2032 )\n\nk\u2032\n\ntanh(E(k\u2032 )/2T )\n\u2206(k\u2032 ),\n2E(k\u2032 )\n\np\n\u03b5(k)2 + \u2206(k)2 .\n\nHere we further assume the BCS approximation for the interaction as\n\u001a\n\u2212V |\u03b5(k)|, |\u03b5(k\u2032 )| < \u03c9c ,\nVa (k, k\u2032 ) =\n0\notherwise,\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03c9c is a cut-off energy. Then, we obtain the well-known formula for Tc as\nTc = 1.13\u03c9c exp(\u22121/\u03c1V ),\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the DOS at the Fermi level.\nAlso in the \u00c9liashberg theory, the superconducting order is determined by the non-trivial solution of\nthe self-consistent equation. In order to determine the critical temperature and corresponding pairing\nsymmetry, the Dyson-Gor'kov equation is linearized with respect to \u2206(k) as\nG(k)\u22121 = G(0) (k)\u22121 \u2212 \u03a3n (k),\n2\n\nF (k) = |G(k)| \u2206(k).\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\nwhere G(k) is the dressed Green function, explicitly written as G(k)=[i\u03c9n \u2212 \u03b5(k) \u2212 \u03b4\u03bc \u2212 \u03a3n (k)]\u22121 . Here\nthe chemical potential shift \u03b4\u03bc is determined by the conservation for the particle number as\nX\n(G(k) \u2212 G(0) (k))ei\u03c9n \u03b7 = 0,\n(14)\nk\n\nwhere \u03b7 is a positive infinitesimal. The self-consistent equation for \u2206(k) is expressed as\nX\n\u2206(k) = \u2212\nVa (k, k \u2032 )|G(k \u2032 )|2 \u2206(k \u2032 ).\n\n(15)\n\nk\u2032\n\nThis linearized equation is called the \u00c9liashberg equation, which is valid just at T =Tc . The transition\ntemperature is practically estimated by solving the eigenvalue equation\nX\nVa (k, k \u2032 )|G(k \u2032 )|2 \u2206(k \u2032 ).\n(16)\n\u03bbe \u2206(k) = \u2212\nk\u2032\n\nThe maximum eigenvalue becomes unity, \u03bbe =1, at T = Tc and the anomalous self-energy \u2206(k) plays a role\nof the eigenfunction. The pairing symmetry is determined by the momentum dependence of \u2206(k). Since\nthe pairing state with maximum Tc is usually realized in the ground state, we can get knowledge on the\nbehaviors below Tc from the \u00c9liashberg equation. The momentum dependence of the quasi-particle energy\ngap is approximately described by the absolute value |\u2206(k)| at \u03c9n = \u03c0Tc . Note that strictly the excitation\ngap \u2206ex (k) is renormalized as \u2206ex (k)=z(k)|\u2206(k, \u2206ex (k))|, where z(k)=(1 \u2212 \u2202Re\u03a3n (k, \u03c9)/\u2202\u03c9|\u03c9=0 )\u22121 is\nthe renormalization factor.\nThe \u00c9liashberg theory includes the normal self-energy, which generally induces de-pairing effects. In\nparticular, the quasi-particle damping gives rise to the pair-breaking and suppresses Tc . Note that the\nde-pairing effects are not expected to alter the pairing symmetry. The frequency dependence of the\neffective interaction represents the retardation effect, which also reduces Tc . The \u00c9liashberg theory is\nusually called \"strong-coupling theory\" in contrast to the weak-coupling theory in Eqs. (8) and (9). We\nshould note that the \"strong-coupling superconductivity\" discussed in Sec. 4 has a different meaning.\nIn the specific calculations, the normal and anomalous self-energies are evaluated by using an approximation. For the convenience in the following sections, we summarize the expressions for \u03a3n (k) and\nVa (k, k \u2032 ) in several approximations.\n\n\f22\n\nFigure 11. Diagrammatic representation of the normal self-energy within the TOP.\n\nFigure 12. Diagrammatic representation of the anomalous self-energy within the TOP.\n\nFirst we show the perturbation series within the third order in terms of U [ 18, 19], which will be used\nin Secs. 3.2.3, 3.3.2, and 3.4.2. The normal self-energy is separated into three terms as\n(3RPA)\n(k).\n(k) + \u03a3(3VC)\n\u03a3n (k) = \u03a3(2)\nn\nn (k) + \u03a3n\n\nThese terms are represented in Figs. 11(a-c), written as\nX\n2\n\u03a3(2)\n\u03c70 (q)G(0) (k \u2212 q),\nn (k) = U\n\n(17)\n\n(18)\n\nq\n\n\u03a3(3RPA)\n(k) = U 3\nn\n\nX\nq\n\n\u03a3(3VC)\n(k) = U 3\nn\n\nX\nq\n\n\u03c70 (q)2 G(0) (k \u2212 q),\n\n\u03c60 (q)2 G(0) (q \u2212 k),\n\nwhere \u03c70 (q) and \u03c60 (q) are, respectively, given by\nX\n\u03c70 (q) = \u2212\nG(0) (k + q)G(0) (k),\n\n(19)\n(20)\n\n(21)\n\nk\n\nand\n\u03c60 (q) =\n\nX\nk\n\nG(0) (q \u2212 k)G(0) (k).\n\n(22)\n\nHere q denotes a shorthand notation as q=(q, i\u03a9n ), where \u03a9n =2\u03c0T n is a boson Matsubara frequency.\nWithin the third-order perturbation, the effective interaction in the singlet channel is expressed as\nVas (k, k \u2032 ) = U + Va(2) (k, k \u2032 ) + Va(3RPA) (k, k \u2032 ) + Va(3VC) (k, k \u2032 ),\n\n(23)\n\nwhere the first, second, third, and fourth terms are represented in the diagrams in Fig. 12(a), (b), (c)+(d),\n\n\f23\n\nFigure 13. Diagrammatic representation of the normal self-energy within the RPA or FLEX approximation. The bare (dressed) Green function is used in the RPA (FLEX).\n\nand (e)+(f)+(g)+(h), respectively. Explicitly, those terms are written as\nVa(2) (k, k \u2032 ) =\nVa(3RPA) (k, k \u2032 )\nVa(3VC) (k, k \u2032 )\n\n=\n=\n\nU 2 \u03c70 (k \u2212 k \u2032 ),\n3\n\n(24)\n\n\u2032 2\n\n2U \u03c70 (k \u2212 k ) ,\nX\n2U 3 Re\nG(0) (k + q)G(0) (k \u2032 + q)[\u03c70 (q) + \u03c60 (q)].\n\n(25)\n(26)\n\nq\n\nNote that the first three terms in Vas (k, k \u2032 ) are included in the RPA, while the last term is called \"vertex\ncorrection\".\nThe effective interactions for the triplet channel are given by the same diagrams as Fig. 12. Note here\nthat these diagrams are obtained in case of d\u02c6 k \u1e91, where d\u02c6 is the d-vector [ 146], but the SU(2) symmetry\nensures the same results for the other d-vector. The explicit expressions for the triplet channel are given\nby\nVat (k, k \u2032 ) = Va(2) (k, k \u2032 ) + Va(3VC) (k, k \u2032 ),\n\n(27)\n\nVa(2) (k, k \u2032 ) = \u2212U 2 \u03c70 (k \u2212 k \u2032 ),\nX\nVa(3VC) (k, k \u2032 ) = 2U 3 Re\nG(0) (k + q)G(0) (k \u2032 + q)[\u03c70 (q) \u2212 \u03c60 (q)].\n\n(28)\n\nwhere\n\n(29)\n\nq\n\nNote that for the triplet channel, the third-order RPA terms cancel each other and only the vertex\ncorrection terms remain.\nNext let us show the expressions for the RPA, which corresponds to the partial summation, as shown\nin Figs. 13 and 14 [ 173, 174]. The normal self-energy is given as\nX\n\u03a3n (k) =\nVn (q)G(0) (k \u2212 q),\n(30)\nq\n\nwhere Vn (q) is given in the RPA as\n1\n3\nVn (q) = U 2 [ \u03c7s (q) + \u03c7c (q) \u2212 \u03c70 (q)].\n2\n2\n\n(31)\n\nHere \u03c7s (q) and \u03c7c (q) are the spin and charge susceptibilities in the RPA, respectively, given by\n\u03c7s (q) =\n\n\u03c70 (q)\n,\n1 \u2212 U \u03c70 (q)\n\n\u03c7c (q) =\n\n\u03c70 (q)\n.\n1 + U \u03c70 (q)\n\n(32)\n\nThe effective interaction for the singlet and triplet channel is given by\n3\n1\nVas (k, k \u2032 ) = U + U 2 \u03c7s (k \u2212 k \u2032 ) \u2212 U 2 \u03c7c (k \u2212 k \u2032 ),\n2\n2\n\n(33)\n\n\f24\n\nFigure 14.

Because \u03c70 (q) > 0 at \u03a9n = 0, the spin part generally gives larger contribution than the\ncharge part. In particular, the contribution from the charge susceptibility is suppressed in the vicinity of\nthe magnetic instability (\u03c70 (q) \u223c 1). The closeness to the magnetic instability is an implicit assumption\nfor the RPA. Then, the RPA in the Hubbard model is a description for the spin fluctuation theory\n(Sec 3.2.1).\nThe FLEX approximation [ 22], which is one of conserving approximations, has been used very widely.\nIn this paper, Sec. 3.2.4 will be devoted to the review of the FLEX approximation, but here we provide\na short comment on the formulation. The FLEX approximation can be also considered as one of the\nmodifications of the RPA, in the sense that the dressed Green function G is used in Eqs. (21), (22),\n(30)-(34), instead of the bare Green function G(0) . Then, the Green function, normal self-energy, spin\nand charge susceptibility are determined self-consistently.\nThe numerical calculation is used to take a summation in these diagrammatic techniques. The figures\nin this review show the results with 128\u00d7128 points in the first Brillouin zone and 2048 Matsubara\nfrequency. In same cases, the calculations have been performed for smaller number of meshes, when we\nhave confirmed that there is no problem in accuracy of the calculations. Note that Tc should be zero in\nthe strict two-dimensional system due to the Mermin-Wagner theorem, although the estimation of Tc has\nbeen frequently performed in two dimensions. This point will be briefly discussed later in this article.\n3.2. High-Tc cuprates\n3.2.1. Overview\nA number of the pairing mechanisms have been proposed for high-Tc superconductivity. After intensive\ninvestigations over more than a decade, the magnetic mechanism based on the spin fluctuation theory\nhas been accepted most predominantly. This mechanism has been first discussed for the superfluidity in\n3\nHe, where the ferromagnetic paramagnon mediates the p-wave pairing interaction [ 146, 175]. Next it\nhas been pointed out that the d-wave superconductivity is most favorable when the spin fluctuation is\nanti-ferromagnetic [ 173, 174].\nAfter the proposals on this mechanism for cuprates [ 28, 176] and the detailed investigations on the\nHubbard model [ 22, 29, 177], the significant developments have been given by the phenomenological\ntheory [ 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185]. Subsequently, the microscopic theory using the FLEX\napproximation [ 22, 177, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193] has clarified the detailed and important properties. The calculated results have succeeded in the quantitative agreement on the transition\ntemperature. Moreover, the various properties both in the normal and superconducting state have been\nexplained [ 194, 195], except for the pseudogap phenomena.\nNote that the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave superconductivity is obtained also in the t-J Hamiltonian near the halffilling as a result of the variational Monte Carlo simulation [ 33, 34], exact diagonalization [ 196], and\nGreen function Monte Carlo simulation [ 197]. Then, the pairing mechanism should be classified into the\nmagnetic one, since the t-J Hamiltonian directly includes the anti-ferromagnetic interaction.\nAt present, the magnetic mechanism should be regarded as one of the limiting cases of the electronic\n\n\f25\nmechanism, in which the momentum dependence of the residual interaction among the quasi-particles\ninevitably gives the superconducting ground state. This idea has been first given by Kohn and Luttinger\nin 1965 [ 198]. They discussed the possibility of the non-s-wave pairing state in the three-dimensional\nfermion gas model within the second-order perturbation. This general concept is particularly important\nfor the comprehensive understanding from the under-doped to the over-doped region. This is because\nthe spin fluctuation theory loses its justification in the over-doped region, where the spin fluctuation is\nnot clearly observed but Tc remains substantially.\nThe results of the perturbation theory [ 18, 19] (see Sec. 3.2.3) have been quite instructive, in the sense\nthat the roles of the RPA and non-RPA terms are clarified. The spin fluctuation theory corresponds\nto the partial summation of the perturbation series. In other word, the RPA terms (including some\nrenormalization) are included in the spin fluctuation theory. The perturbation theory has revealed that\nthe RPA terms favor the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave superconductivity in the Hubbard model near the half-filling, while\nit is suppressed by the non-RPA terms. Therefore, it is expected that the RPA terms play a major role\nin the pairing interaction, even far from the magnetic instability. Again, the perturbation theory has\nrevealed that the corrections from the non-RPA terms are not important for the case of cuprates. This is\na microscopic justification why the concept of the magnetic mechanism survives in the over-doped region.\nRoughly speaking, the perturbation theory is appropriate to the over-doped region, while the spinfluctuation theory is appropriate to the optimally-doped region. Also in the under-doped region, the\nmain pairing mechanism should be in common with that in the optimally-doped region, although the\nSC fluctuation remarkably reduces the transition temperature. In our understanding, the SC fluctuation\nis the origin of the pseudogap phenomena, which has been a challenging issue in the study of high-Tc\ncuprates. Therefore, we will describe in detail the theory including SC fluctuations in Sec. 4 in order to\nunderstand the under-doped region. In this section, we focus on the pairing mechanism in the optimallyand over-doped region.\nIn Sec. 3.2.2, we provide a simple explanation on the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave superconductivity induced by the\nAF spin fluctuation. The important scattering process for the pairing is explained. In Sec. 3.2.3, we\nreview the results on the perturbation theory which is performed within the third order. The obtained\nresults are qualitatively similar to those of the spin fluctuation theory. The corrections to the spin\nfluctuation theory are discussed. In Sec. 3.2.4, we show the results of the FLEX approximation, which is\na microscopic description for the spin fluctuation theory. The reasonable Tc \u223c 100K is obtained near the\nmagnetic instability. We discuss the effects of higher-order corrections in Sec. 3.2.5. Some justifications\nfor the spin fluctuation theory will be shown.\n3.2.2. Spin fluctuation-induced superconductivity\nFirst let us explain the phenomenological theory on the spin fluctuation-induced superconductivity [\n178, 179, 180, 181]. The effective interaction Va (k, k \u2032 ) is phenomenologically given in this theory. Here\nwe use the weak-coupling theory for simplicity. This treatment is quantitatively insufficient, but it is\nenough to grasp the basic idea of spin fluctuation-induced superconductivity.\nA simple form of the effective Hamiltonian is described as\nX\nX\nHeff =\n\u03b5(k)c\u2020k\u03c3 ck\u03c3 \u2212 g 2\n\u03c7s (q)\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 * \u03c3\u03b3\u03b4 c\u2020k+q\u03b1 c\u2020k\u2032 \u2212q\u03b3 ck\u2032 \u03b4 ck\u03b2 ,\n(35)\nk,k\u2032 ,q\n\nk\u03c3\n\nwhere \u03c3=(\u03c3x , \u03c3y , \u03c3z ) are the Pauli matrices and g is the effective coupling constant for the interaction\nexchanging the spin fluctuation. We denote the static spin susceptibility as \u03c7s (q) = \u03c7s (q, 0). The spin\nsusceptibility \u03c7s (q, \u03a9) near the magnetic instability is phenomenologically expressed as [ 199, 200]\n\u03c7s (q, \u03a9) =\n\n1+\n\n\u03be 2 (q\n\n\u03b1\u03be 2\n,\n\u2212 Q)2 \u2212 i\u0393q 2\u2212z \u03a9\n\n(36)\n\nwhere \u03be is the correlation length of the spin fluctuation, Q is the wave vector defined as Q = (\u03c0, \u03c0)\n(Q = (0, 0)) and z is the dynamical exponent z=2 (z=3) for the anti-ferromagnetic (ferromagnetic) case.\nA large value of \u03be is a hypothesis of the spin fluctuation theory, which is expected around the magnetic\ninstability. The strong enhancement of the static susceptibility around q \u223c Q essentially induces the\nunconventional superconductivity. The dissipation term \u0393 describes the time scale of the spin fluctuation.\nThe diffusive dynamics of the spin fluctuation is a characteristic property in the normal state. This is\n\n\f26\n\nFigure 15. Effective interaction which corresponds to the single paramagnon exchange. The wavy line\nrepresents the propagator of the paramagnon.\n\nFigure 16. Typical Fermi surface of high-Tc cuprates. The order parameter of the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave superconductivity has positive (negative) sign in the shaded (light) region. The scattering process exchanging the\nAF spin fluctuation is shown by the dashed line.\n\nnot the case in the SC state or in the AF state. The \u03a9-dependence induces the retardation effect, but it\nis not included in the weak-coupling theory.\nIn the weak-coupling theory, the gap equation is written as\n\u2206(k) = \u2212\n\nX\nk\n\n\u2032\n\nVas,t (k \u2212 k\u2032 )\n\ntanh(E(k\u2032 )/2T )\n\u2206(k\u2032 ),\n2E(k\u2032 )\n\n(37)\n\nwhere the pairing interaction V s,t is given as\nVas (k \u2212 k\u2032 ) =\n\n3 2\ng \u03c7s (k \u2212 k\u2032 ),\n2\n\n(38)\n\nfor the singlet pairing and\n1\nVat (k \u2212 k\u2032 ) = \u2212 g 2 \u03c7s (k \u2212 k\u2032 ),\n2\n\n(39)\n\nfor the triplet pairing. This is a result in the level of the one-loop approximation for the effective model\nEq. (35). Here note that the effective interaction Vas,t (k \u2212 k\u2032 ) corresponds to the single paramagnon\nexchange, which is diagrammatically represented in Fig. 15. The irreducible vertex estimated from the\nquantum Monte Carlo simulation is in good agreement with the single paramagnon exchange at least in\nthe high-temperature region [ 201, 15]. This form of the effective interaction can be derived from the RPA\nor FLEX approximation for the Hubbard model, when g is considered as the on-site Coulomb interaction\nU . In this sense, the RPA and FLEX approximations are regarded as a microscopic description of the\nspin fluctuation theory. An advantage of the phenomenological theory is its universality, which does not\ndepend on the microscopic details. It should be considered that the renormalization from the high-energy\nexcitation and the higher-order corrections are effectively included in the phenomenological parameters.\n\n\f27\nBy integrating the momentum perpendicular to the Fermi surface, introducing the cut-off energy \u03c9c\nand transposing the velocity v(k) = |\u2202\u03b5(k)/\u2202k| as the average on the Fermi surface, the transition\ntemperature is obtained as\nTc = 1.13\u03c9c exp(\u22121/\u03c1|Vsc |),\nwhere the effective coupling constant Vsc is given by\nZ Z\ndkdk \u2032 \u2206(k)Vas,t (k \u2212 k\u2032 )\u2206(k \u2032 ).\nVsc =\nF\n\n(40)\n\n(41)\n\nF\n\nR\nR\nHere the gap function is normalized as F dk|\u2206(k)|2 = 1. The integration F is performed along the\nFermi surface.\nIn actual systems, it is considered that the pairing symmetry with maximum Tc is stabilized. For\nexample, the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave superconductivity is stabilized when Vsc is attractive (Vsc < 0) and smallest\nfor the gap function \u2206(k) = \u2206d (k) \u221d cos kx \u2212 cos ky . This is the case of high-Tc cuprates where antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations are active. We can easily understand this result from the typical Fermi\nsurface, as shown in Fig. 16. The scattering process from k1 \u223c (\u03c0, 0) to k2 \u223c (0, \u2212\u03c0) is strongly enhanced\nand attractive for the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave symmetry (\u2206d (k1 )Va (k1 \u2212 k2 )\u2206d (k2 ) < 0). It is essential that the\norder parameter changes its sign from k1 to k2 and the effective interaction Va (k1 \u2212 k2 ) is enhanced\naround k1 \u2212 k2 \u223c Q.\nIn fact, it has been shown that the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave symmetry is most favorable in the weak-coupling theory\n[ 178, 179, 180, 181]. After that, the quantitative estimation for the transition temperature was performed\non the basis of the strong-coupling theory where the phenomenological parameters were determined from\nthe results of the NMR and resistivity. Then, Tc was estimated to be a reasonable value as Tc \u223c 100K [\n182, 183, 184, 185]. The quantitative agreement between theoretical and experimental Tc 's has strongly\nsupported the validity of the spin fluctuation mechanism.\nBefore closing this subsection, let us comment on the ferromagnetic spin fluctuation, where \u03c7s (q) is\nenhanced around q = (0, 0). Here we consider the three-dimensional fermion gas model as a typical\nexample. In this case, the triplet p-wave superconductivity is favored, since the effective interaction in\nthe triplet channel Eq. (39) is strongly attractive for the scattering process from k to k\u2032 \u223c k. Note that\nthe detailed band structure is not important in this case. It is widely believed that the ferromagnetic\nspin fluctuation stabilizes the Anderson-Brinkman-Morel state in the superfluid 3 He [ 146, 175]. The\nestimation by using the phenomenological theory [ 202] and the FLEX approximation [ 203] shows that\nTc in the ferromagnetic case is generally low compared with the anti-ferromagnetic case.\nThe first proposal for the pairing mechanism in Sr2 RuO4 was superconductivity mediated by ferromagnetic spin fluctuations [ 204, 205] (see Sec. 3.4.1). However, this naive expectation was denied by the\nexperimental results which did not observe the ferromagnetic spin fluctuation [ 14]. This is not a mystery\nfrom the point of view on the electronic mechanism. In such a case, we should restart the discussion from\nmore general framework, as will be shown in Sec. 3.4.\n3.2.3. Perturbation theory\nIn the following subsections we explain the microscopic theories. First let us review the perturbation\ntheory, which is a method for the systematic estimation of the effective interaction, certainly justified\nin the weak-coupling region. The expansion parameter here is U/W , where U is the on-site Coulomb\nrepulsion and W is the band width. The principle of the adiabatic continuity in the Fermi-liquid theory\nrequires the regularity of the expansion. For instance, a good convergence has been confirmed in the\nKondo problem based on the Anderson Hamiltonian, while the expansion with respect to the Kondo\nexchange coupling J is singular in the s-d model [ 206]. Also in the periodic system, the perturbation\nmethod is expected to be useful to understand the qualitative natures in the weak coupling region U <W ,\nas long as any long-range order does not occur. Note that the low-dimensional system d < 2 is beyond\nour scope in this review (d is the dimensionality). We can see the applicability of the perturbation theory\nin the case of d = 2 in Refs. [ 207] and [ 208].\nAs is mentioned before, the spin fluctuation theory can be described by the perturbation scheme.\nThe phenomenological form of the effective interaction in Eqs. (38) and (39) is derived from the partial\nsummation of the RPA terms. We should note that the partial summation is sometimes dangerous as\na microscopic estimation, since it is generally expected that RPA terms are considerably canceled by\n\n\f28\n\nFigure 17. Tc in the various approximations for t\u2032 /t = 0.15 and \u03b4=0.1.\n\nthe neglected terms, e.g., vertex corrections. In contrast to the spin fluctuation theory, the perturbation\ntheory has a well-defined basis. Namely, all kinds of the terms are estimated on an equal footing. The\ncontribution from the non-RPA terms first appears in the third order. Therefore, it is expected that the\nthird-order perturbation (TOP) theory clarifies the general tendency of the vertex corrections.\nThe application of the perturbation theory to the estimation of Tc in high-Tc superconductors has been\nfirst performed by Hotta. He has performed both the second-order [ 18] and third-order calculation [ 19]\nfor the d-p model. In the following, we show the calculated results for the Hubbard model, because this\nis simpler than the d-p model and it provides the qualitatively same results. The Hubbard Hamiltonian\nis expressed as\nX\nX\nH=\n\u03b5(k)c\u2020k\u03c3 ck\u03c3 + U\nni\u2191 ni\u2193 ,\n(42)\nk\u03c3\n\ni\n\nwhere ni\u03c3 =c\u2020i\u03c3 ci\u03c3 at site i. The two-dimensional dispersion relation \u03b5(k) is given by the tight-binding\nmodel for the square lattice as\n\u03b5(k) = \u22122t(cos kx + cos ky ) + 4t\u2032 cos kx cos ky \u2212 \u03bc,\n\n(43)\n\nwhere t and t\u2032 represent the nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes, respectively.\nIn Secs. 3.2 and 4, we take the energy unit as 2t=1, indicating that the band width W is given by W =4.\nIf we choose W =4eV according to the band-structure calculation [ 209], the experimentally observed\nTc =100K corresponds to Tc =0.01 in our unit. The next nearest-neighbor hopping, which corresponds\nto the p-p hopping in the d-p model, is needed to reproduce the typical Fermi surface of cuprates. The\nreasonable value for t\u2032 is considered to be t\u2032 /t = 0.1 \u223c 0.4, leading to the Fermi surface consistent with\nthe experimental observation [ 45, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216] and the band-structure calculation [\n209].\nFollowing the \u00c9liashberg theory (Sec. 3.1), the superconducting transition temperature is determined\nby solving the \u00c9liashberg equation Eq. (16). Within the TOP, the normal self-energy is estimated as\nEqs. (17)-(20), and the effective interaction for the singlet channel is estimated as Eqs. (23)-(26). It should\n(3RPA)\n(2)\n(k, k \u2032 )\nbe again noted that the second-order term Va (k, k \u2032 ) and a part of the third-order terms Va\n(3VC)\n\u2032\n(k, k ) exist in the third order, leading to the\ncontribute to the RPA terms. The non-RPA terms Va\nlowest-order corrections to the spin fluctuation theory.\nIn the TOP, the most favorable pairing symmetry is the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave around the half-filling. Thus,\nwe show only the results for the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave symmetry in the following. In Fig. 17, Tc is depicted as\na function of U . For comparison, we also show the results for the second-order perturbation (SOP),\nthird-order perturbation without vertex correction (TOPWOVC), and RPA. The thin curves with labels\n\"P\" in Fig. 17 denote the results in which the normal self-energy is simply ignored.\nWe can see that the sufficiently high Tc =0.01\u223c100K is obtained in the moderate coupling region. Here\nthe attractive interaction in the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave channel is mainly from the RPA terms. In Fig. 18, we\nshow the irreducible spin susceptibility, which exhibits the peak around (\u03c0, \u03c0). Then, the momentum\ndependence of the RPA terms is moderate, but qualitatively similar to the phenomenological theory (see\nEqs. (36) and (38)). Therefore, the same scattering process as shown in Fig. 16 mainly contributes to the\ndx2 \u2212y2 -wave superconductivity. It should be stressed that so strong enhancement of the spin fluctuation\n\n\f29\n\nFigure 18.

The imaginary part of the self-energy on the Fermi surface Im\u03a3R\nn (k F , 0) for t /t=0.15, \u03b4=0.1,\nU/t=3, and T =0.01. The horizontal axis \u03b8 is shown in Fig. 16. The analytic continuation from the\nMatsubara frequency to the real frequency is carried out by the Pad\u00e9 approximation [ 222] through this\nreview.\n\nis not necessary for the appearance of superconductivity. The perturbative renormalization group theory\nhas consistently expected the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave superconductivity arising from the same scattering process\n[ 30, 31, 32, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221], where the scattering amplitude from (k1 , \u2212k1 ) to (k2 , \u2212k2 ) is\nenhanced in the low energy effective action.\nThe comparison between the TOP(P) and the TOPWOVC(P) shows that the vertex correction terms\nsuppress the value of Tc . Thus, it is generally expected that the RPA terms are considerably canceled\nby the vertex correction terms. However, it is understood from the comparison between the TOP(P)\nand SOP(P) that the RPA terms overcome the vertex corrections: The third-order terms totally enhance\nthe dx2 \u2212y2 -wave superconductivity. In other words, the RPA-terms are not completely suppressed by\nthe vertex corrections even far from the magnetic instability. Thus, we conclude that the vertex correction is not so severe in this case. Qualitatively the same mechanism as the spin fluctuation-induced\nsuperconductivity is expected in the weak coupling region, which corresponds to the over-doped cuprates.\nSimultaneously, this continuity confirms the applicability of the spin fluctuation theory in the optimallydoped region.\nNext we discuss the effect of the normal self-energy. We can see from Fig. 17 that the value of Tc\nis reduced by the de-pairing effect. Because the reduction factor is about a half in the TOP, the same\norder of the magnitude of Tc still remains, even if the de-pairing effect is considered. The realistic value\nTc =0.01\u223c100K is found around U/t=3.2, where U/W =0.4. On the other hand, Tc is remarkably reduced\nin the TOPWOVC, since the RPA terms intensify each other and give rise to a large self-energy. Indeed,\nthe RPA terms in the normal self-energy are considerably compensated by the vertex correction. This is\nthe reason why the reduction of Tc is moderate in the TOP. The third-order terms in the normal self-energy\n(3VC)\n(3RPA)\n(k)=0 for\n(k) + \u03a3n\ncompletely cancels each other in the particle-hole symmetric case, namely \u03a3n\n\u2032\nt = 0 and \u03b4 = 0. The remained contribution in the particle-hole asymmetric case rather reduces the\nquasi-particle damping (see Fig. 19). As a result, the value of Tc in the TOP can be higher than that in\n\n\f30\n\nFigure 20. The doping dependence of Tc calculated by the TOP for U/t=4. The normal self-energy is\nignored for simplicity.\n\nthe TOPWOVC owing to the de-pairing effect. Thus, it is generally expected that the normal self-energy\nis overestimated in the spin fluctuation theory, and thus, the magnitude of Tc is underestimated.\nFinally, we show the doping dependence of Tc in Fig. 20. For simplicity, here we ignore the normal\nself-energy, which is not important to see the qualitative behavior within the TOP. If t\u2032 /t = 0, Tc takes\nthe maximum value just at half-filling, because both the staggard susceptibility \u03c70 (Q) and the electronic\nDOS becomes largest at \u03b4=0. By introducing the next nearest-neighbor hopping, the peak position is\nshifted to the hole-doped region. This is mainly due to the fact that the DOS takes its maximum value in\nthe hole-doping side, since the Fermi surface crosses the van Hove singularity. These features will again\nappear in the FLEX approximation.\n3.2.4. FLEX approximation\nIt is considered that the spin fluctuation plays an important role in the optimally- and under-doped\nregion, where the strong enhancement of the spin fluctuation is observed [ 27, 65, 66, 73]. Since the\nperturbation theory is not sufficient to describe the strong spin fluctuation, some approximation beyond\nthe TOP is required. A simple microscopic theory on the spin fluctuation is the RPA, but the tendency\nof the magnetic order is seriously overestimated in the RPA. Thus, the strong spin fluctuation in the\nquasi-two-dimensional systems is not correctly described, unfortunately. Among the several modifications of the simple RPA, fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation has been used most widely. This\napproximation includes the renormalization of the spin fluctuation within the one-loop order, but the\ntheory is surprisingly improved at this level. The magnetic properties in the nearly AF Fermi-liquid [\n178, 179, 180, 181, 194, 195] are appropriately reproduced, since the mode coupling effect is partly included [ 194]. For instance, the Curie-Weiss law in the NMR 1/T1 T is obtained in the wide temperature\nregion, as shown in Fig. 60 (See also [ 188]). Applying the FLEX approximation to the Hubbard model\n[ 22, 177, 186, 187, 188, 189] or d-p model [ 190, 191, 192, 193], the doping dependences are properly\nreproduced at least from the over- to optimally-doped region Thus, the results of the FLEX approximation are reviewed in this subsection and the following discussion is complementary with the perturbation\ntheory in Sec. 3.2.2. The higher-order corrections beyond the FLEX approximation will be discussed in\nthe next subsection.\nIt should be mentioned that the accuracy in the quantitative estimation from the microscopic level\nis still questionable, because the FLEX approximation is also a partial summation of the perturbation\nseries. However, we consider that the FLEX theory has a robust meaning as a semi-phenomenological\ntheory, since the effect of spin fluctuations is qualitatively well grasped in this approximation. Moreover,\nit is noted that unphysical results inherent in the phenomenological theory are considerably excluded.\nThe FLEX approximation is one of the conserving approximation, formulated in the scheme of Baym\nand Kadanoff [ 169, 171] (see Eqs. (5) and (6)). The well-defined basis makes it possible to perform\nthe systematic calculation for the single- and two-particle properties in a coherent way. In fact, various\nquantities in the normal state have been calculated by using the FLEX approximation [ 93, 188, 223]. In\ngeneral, anomalous properties arising from the AF spin fluctuation have been well explained within the\nFLEX approximation. The applicable region of the FLEX approximation is roughly between T0 and T \u2217\nin Fig. 1, since the SC fluctuation plays an essential role in the pseudogap state. We review the results\n\n\f31\n\nFigure 21. The momentum dependence of the static spin susceptibility in (a) electron-doped (10%), (b)\nunder-doped (10%), and (c) optimally-doped (16%) region. Here, t\u2032 /t = 0.25, T = 0.01 and U/t = 3.2\nfor hole-doped case, U/t = 3 for electron-doped case.\n\nof the normal-state properties together with the pseudogap phenomena in Sec. 4.3. This subsection is\ndevoted to the review on the superconducting instability within the accuracy of mean field theory.\nLet us move on to the formulation of the FLEX approximation. In the FLEX approximation, the\nnormal self-energy is expressed as\nX\n1\n3\n(44)\n\u03a3F (k) =\nU 2 [ \u03c7s (q) + \u03c7c (q) \u2212 \u03c70 (q)]G(k \u2212 q),\n2\n2\nq\nwhere \u03c7s (q) and \u03c7c (q) are given by Eq. (32). Note that \u03c70 (q) is the irreducible susceptibility, which\nshould be defined by using the dressed Green function as\nX\n\u03c70 (q) = \u2212\nG(k)G(k + q).\n(45)\nk\n\nNote that G(k) is self-consistently determined with the self-energy and susceptibilities. Throughout this\nself-consistent iterations, the renormalization effect on the spin fluctuation is included in the self-energy.\nThe spin fluctuation gives a large contribution to the self-energy in the quasi-2D systems, and thus, the\nmagnetic order is suppressed. As a result, the FLEX approximation provides a wide critical region, in\nwhich the spin fluctuation is strongly enhanced. For an expression of the spin susceptibility Eq. (32)\ndoes not include the vertex corrections, which should be required in the conservation scheme, but it is\nconsidered that this correction is not severe [ 188]. Note that even in the conservation scheme, this vertex\ncorrection is not needed in the single-particle properties and superconducting Tc .\nThe superconducting transition is determined by solving the \u00c9liashberg equation, Eq. (16), where\nthe effective interaction in the singlet channel is given by Eq. (33) with the self-consistently determined\nsusceptibility. Near the magnetic instability, the second term in the right hand side of Eq. (33) becomes\ndominant. Then, the expressions are similar to those of the phenomenological theory with g replaced by\nU . It should be stressed again that the expressions are determined from the microscopic model.\nThe FLEX approximation was first performed by Bickers et al. [ 22, 177] for the 2D Hubbard model\nwith only the nearest-neighbor hopping. They have shown that the AF order exists near the half-filling\nand the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave superconductivity occurs in the vicinity to the AF state. After that, intensive studies\non the Hubbard model [ 186, 187, 188, 189] and on the d-p model [ 190, 191, 192, 193] have commonly\nobtained the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave superconductivity. We show the momentum dependence of the static spin\nsusceptibility in Fig. 21, where the results for the optimally-doped, under-doped, and electron-doped\ncases are shown. It is observed that the spin fluctuation is strongly enhanced around q = (\u03c0, \u03c0). Thus,\nthe dx2 \u2212y2 -wave superconductivity is mainly induced by the scattering process shown in Fig. 16. The\norder parameter is deformed, but similar to the conventional form \u2206(k) \u221d cos kx \u2212 cos ky , as shown in\nFig. 22. Since the scattering process between the zone boundary region (the circle in Fig. 16) plays a\ndominant role, the order parameter takes large absolute value around \u03b8=0 or \u03c0/2. This deformation is\nin agreement with the experimental results of ARPES [ 224].\nWe show the results of Tc for the Hubbard model and those for the d-p model in Figs. 23 and 24,\nrespectively. Figure 23(a) shows the results for the electron-doped case, together. In general, the transition temperature increases with the development of the spin fluctuation, namely with decreasing \u03b4\n\n\f32\n\nFigure 22. The momentum dependence of the order parameter \u2206(k) = \u2206(k, i\u03c0T ) on the Fermi surface,\nfor U/t = 3, t\u2032 /t = 0.25 and T = Tc . The conventional form \u2206(k) \u221d cos kx \u2212 cos ky is also shown for the\ncomparison. The horizontal axis \u03b8 is shown in Fig. 16.\n\nFigure 23. Tc in the FLEX approximation for the Hubbard model [ 11]. (a) Doping dependence and (b)\nU -dependence for t\u2032 /t = 0.25 and \u03b4 = 0.1.\n\nand/or increasing U . In contrast to the TOP, Tc tends to saturate near the magnetic instability, since\nthe de-pairing effect becomes stronger in that region. The maximum value of Tc is commonly obtained\nas Tc = 0.01 \u223c 0.02 [ 186, 187, 188, 189, 191, 192, 193], which is consistent with the experimental value\nTc \u223c 100K in order of magnitude.\nIt is straightforward to extend the FLEX approximation to the superconducting state. Actually, the\ncalculation has been performed for the Hubbard model [ 186, 187, 188] and for the d-p model [ 193]. The\nratio 2\u2206/Tc = 10 \u223c 12 is commonly obtained, which is much larger than the BCS value 2\u2206/Tc = 3.5.\nThis is mainly due to the feedback effect on the spin fluctuation: Since the de-pairing effect is remarkably\nreduced by the finite excitation gap, the order parameter at T = 0 exceeds the BCS value. This feature\nis qualitatively consistent with the experimental value 2\u2206/Tc = 7 \u223c 8 in the optimally-doped region.\nThis value is over-estimated in the FLEX approximation probably because the de-pairing effect around\nT = Tc is over-estimated (see Sec. 3.2.3).\nThe other interesting property in the superconducting state is the resonance peak. When the system is\nnear the magnetic order, a sharp resonance peak appears in the magnetic excitation with a smaller energy\nthan the maximum gap 2\u2206 [ 188, 193, 225]. It is considered that the resonance peak corresponds to the\n41meV peak observed in the neutron scattering experiments in YBa2 Cu3 O6+\u03b4 [ 226, 227, 228, 229, 230].\nThe influence of the resonance peak appears in the dip-hump structure in the quasi-particle spectrum\nand \"kink\" in the quasi-particle dispersion around (\u03c0, 0) [ 193, 225, 231], which is also consistent with\nthe ARPES measurements [ 45, 106, 232].\nFinally let us review the application of the FLEX approximation to the electron-doped cuprates which\nhas been recently performed [ 11, 93, 233, 234]. The FLEX approximation also indicates the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave\nsuperconductivity in the electron-doped region, which has been confirmed by the recent experiments [\n49, 50, 51, 52, 53]. Moreover, the drastic particle-hole asymmetry in the phase diagram [ 23] is explained\nsimply by taking account of the next-nearest-neighbor hopping t\u2032 and choosing the electron number. In\ngeneral, the electron correlation is relatively weak in the electron-doped region, because the electronic\n\n\f33\n\nFigure 24. Tc in the FLEX approximation for the d-p model [ 193].\n\nFigure 25. The Fermi surface obtained in the FLEX approximation for the hole- (thick line) and electrondoped (thin line) cases. Dashed lines show the non-interacting Fermi surface. The nesting nature is\nenhanced by the AF spin fluctuation [ 86].\n\nDOS decreases with electron-doping. Therefore, more conventional behaviors are expected in the normal\nstate [ 11]. The detailed discussion will be given in Sec. 4.3.2. On the other hand, the AF order is\nrobust for the carrier doping (Fig. 23(a)) because of the nesting property of the Fermi surface, as shown\nin Fig. 25. An interesting nature of the AF state appears in the electron-doped region [ 235], which has\nbeen well explained by the numerical calculation on the t-t\u2032 -J model [ 236].\nMore interestingly, the superconducting Tc is very low and the doping region possessing the superconductivity is narrow [ 11, 234]. This is understood by the following two reasons: One is the localized\nnature of the spin fluctuation in the momentum space (see Fig. 21). Then, the total weight of the spin\nfluctuation becomes small. It should be noted that the effective interaction |Vsc | is not determined by\nthe magnetic correlation length. The other is the small DOS due to the fact that the Fermi level is apart\nfrom the flat dispersion around (\u03c0, 0). Thus, the effective coupling \u03c1|Vsc | decreases in the electron-doped\nregion, and thus, Tc becomes low. These features are consistent with the experimentally observed phase\ndiagram [ 23], and lead to the no appearance of the pseudogap phenomena (see Sec. 4.3.2).\nAnother interesting feature is the strong modulation in order parameter. Namely, the order parameter\nhas its maximum magnitude around the magnetic Brillouin zone. This is an inevitable result of the\nspin fluctuation-induced superconductivity, because the commensurate spin fluctuation (Fig. 21) induces\nthe strongest interaction between the magnetic Brillouin zone. Recent Raman scattering measurement\nhas supported this modulation of the order parameter [ 237]. Such a detailed consistency supports the\nimportance of the spin fluctuation in the electron-doped cuprates.\nSummarizing, some detailed and interesting properties including the particle-hole asymmetry are well\nreproduced by the microscopic theory starting from the Fermi-liquid state. We consider that this is\nan important suggestion for the wide applicability and possibility of the microscopic theory for other\nstrongly correlated electron materials. In fact, Secs. 3.3 and 3.4 are devoted to the application to the\norganic superconductor and Sr2 RuO4 , respectively.\n\n\f34\n\nFigure 26. The renormalization of the interaction corresponding to the Kanamori theory.\n\n3.2.5. higher-order corrections\nThus far, we have not provided any explicit justification of the spin fluctuation theory and/or the\nFLEX approximation. They correspond to a partial summation in the perturbation series. The role\nof the neglected terms is not clear. Needless to say, an absolute work on this problem is very difficult.\nHowever, several types of the higher-order corrections have been estimated and the positive results have\nbeen obtained to some extent.\nOn the basis of the perturbation theory, the corrections first appear in the third-order terms, which\nhave been discussed in Sec. 3.2.3. There are two types of the correction in the effective interaction. One\nis represented by the Feynmann diagram in Figs. 12(e) and (f). The other includes Figs. 12(g) and (h).\nWe have confirmed that both types of the diagram reduce the pairing interaction, that is, both terms in\nEq. (26) are repulsive in the d-wave channel. We furthermore find that the reduction from the two terms\nis nearly the same magnitude.\nThis effect from the diagrams in Figs. 12(e) and (f) is natural, because they are the lowest-order vertex\ncorrection included in the Kanamori-type T-matrix diagram (Fig. 26), which represents the screening\neffect [ 238]. For instance, the higher-order correction represented by the T-matrix was approximately\nestimated by Bulut et al. [ 201]. They have concluded that the bare interaction U/t = 4 is renormalized to\n\u016a /t \u223c 2, where \u016a denotes the renormalized interaction. The coupling constant g in the phenomenological\ntheory, and further U in the FLEX approximation should be regarded as the renormalized coupling\nconstant including the screening effect.\nThe combination of the diagrammatic techniques and the quantum Monte Carlo simulation has shown\nthat the effective pairing interaction and the spin susceptibility are consistently obtained by the generalized RPA, where the renormalized particle-hole vertex \u016a (q) is used [ 15]. The renormalized vertex in\nthe intermediate coupling region U/t=4 is estimated as about 80% of U , namely \u016a (q) \u223c 0.8U . Then, the\nexpression for the effective pairing interaction, given by\n3\nVas (k, k \u2032 ) = U + \u016a 2 \u03c7s (k \u2212 k \u2032 )\n2\n\n(46)\n\nprovides an appropriate estimation, when the renormalized coupling constant \u016a = 0.8U is used with the\nspin susceptibility, obtained by the quantum Monte Carlo simulation. These results have indicated that\nthe other scattering process, such as the multi-paramagnon exchange (see Fig. 27(b)), is negligible at\nleast in the high-temperature region T /t \u223c 0.25.\nWe find the other intensive investigations on the higher-order corrections, namely, the vertex correction\narising from the spin fluctuation [ 195, 201, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246]. The lowest-order\nvertex correction from the spin fluctuation is shown in Fig. 27(a). The diagrams in Figs. 12(g) and (h)\nare included in these corrections, while only the higher-order terms than the forth-order are included in\nthe phenomenological spin fluctuation theory.\nThe strong cancellation of the effective vertex between the fermion and spin fluctuation was suggested by Schrieffer [ 247]. His suggestion raised a serious question on the spin fluctuation-induced\nsuperconductivity, but it was just based on the mean-field theory in the SDW state. On the contrary, the studies in the normal state with diffusive spin fluctuation have commonly concluded that the\nvertex correction represented in Fig. 27(a) furthermore enhances the effective vertex at q = (\u03c0, \u03c0) [\n195, 239, 240, 241, 243, 244, 245, 246, 248]. The numerical calculation has furthermore revealed that the\n\n\f35\n\nFigure 27. (a) The lowest-order vertex correction in the phenomenological spin fluctuation theory. (b)\nThe effective interaction corresponding to the multi-paramagnon exchange. Here, the solid and wavy\nlines are the propagator of the fermion and spin fluctuation, respectively.\n\nmomentum dependence is not so altered by the vertex correction [ 243]. That is, we can appropriately\ninclude the vertex correction by renormalizing the coupling constant as g \u2192 \u03b1g. Here the enhancement\nfactor \u03b1 increases with the development of the spin fluctuation, but is expected not to exceed 2 under\nthe reasonable parameters [ 243, 244]. The effect of the vertex correction on the superconducting Tc has\nalso been estimated [ 239, 245, 246]. The explicit calculation is difficult, but the enhancement of Tc has\nbeen suggested commonly.\nIt should be noted that the diagrams in Figs. 12(g) and (h) provide an opposite contribution, i.e.,\nreduce the effective vertex. This is because only the longitudinal component of the spin fluctuation\nappears in the the vertex correction within the TOP. The transverse component appears in the higherorder correction and changes the sign. Combined with the corrections included in the T-matrix (Fig. 26),\nit is expected that the vertex correction reduces the bare interaction U in the weak-coupling region. This\nexpectation is consistent with the result in the high-temperature region [ 201, 15]. On the other hand,\nthe enhancement of the effective vertex is expected when the spin fluctuation is strongly enhanced. The\nexplicit calculation is an open problem up to now.\nAnother possible correction is the contribution from the multi-paramagnon exchange, which is shown in\nFig. 27(b). This process has been proposed as the \"spin-bag\" mechanism [ 249]. However, the numerical\nestimations have concluded that the pairing interaction arising from this process is almost negligible [\n243, 246].\nIn short, from the above results, we expect that the theory based on the single paramagnon exchange is\nqualitatively justified, although the higher-order corrections are required in the quantitative estimations.\n3.3. Organic Superconductor \u03ba-(ET)2 X\nIn this section, we discuss \u03ba-(ET)2 X compounds among many organic superconductors. The outline\nof the experimental results and interesting issues on these compounds have been reviewed in Sec. 2.2.\nThe metallic conduction in this material is owing to the organic molecule, which is complicated at first\nglance. It is, however, shown that the simplified tight-binding model gives a reasonable understanding\nfor the superconductivity. The successful application of the Hubbard model for the molecular systems\nwill extend the possibility of the microscopic theory.\n3.3.1. Electronic property and tight-binding model\nFirst we review the electronic properties and introduce an effective Hamiltonian. This series of the\norganic materials are systematically described well by the Hubbard model with a tight-binding fitting [\n250, 251]. Note that the site in the Hubbard model is not one atom, but corresponds to one dimer of the\norganic molecules. The procedure for this simplification is given in the following way.\nThe quasi-2D conduction band consists of the \u03c0-orbitals in the ET-molecules. There are four ETmolecules and two holes in a unit cell, as shown in Fig. 28(a). Then, the system is quarter-filling (n = 1.5\nper molecule). In the first simplification, a dimer is regarded as a structural unit. This procedure is\njustified because the transfer integral tb1 is twice larger than the other transfer integrals [ 251, 252].\nThen, the holes are contained in the anti-bonding orbitals in dimers. The bonding orbitals are far below\nthe Fermi level. Focusing on the anti-bonding orbital, each dimer is connected to the nearest neighbor\n\n\f36\n\nFigure 28. (a) The lattice structure of \u03ba-(ET)2 X. b1, b2, etc. stand for the transfer integrals tb1 , tb2 , and\nso on. The unit cell consists of the hatched molecules [ 265]. (b) The structure of the dimerized model.\nThe difference between tc and tc\u2032 is usually neglected [ 265]. (c) The tight binding model corresponding\nto the anisotropic triangular lattice. (d) The typical Fermi surface.\n\nsites by three kinds of transfer integrals (Fig. 28(b)). They are derived as tb = \u2212tb2 /2, tc = (tq \u2212 tp )/2,\nand tc\u2032 = (tq\u2032 \u2212 tp\u2032 )/2. In this dimer model, the system is half-filling (n = 1 per dimer). The AF state in\nthe lower pressure region is a Mott insulator constructed from the dimers [ 251]. Because the difference\nbetween tc and tc\u2032 is negligible (only about 2%), the effective single-band model is derived by setting\ntc = tc\u2032 . Note that the obtained model is mapped to the anisotropic triangular lattice shown in Fig. 28(c).\nNow superconductivity has been discussed on the basis of the Hubbard model on the anisotropic\ntriangular lattice. Because the system is near the Mott transition, the on-site repulsion is expected to be\nmost effective. The Hubbard Hamiltonian has been given in Eq. (42), but the dispersion relation is now\ngiven as\n\u03b5(k) = \u22122t(cos kx + cos ky ) \u2212 2t\u2032 cos(kx + ky ) \u2212 \u03bc.\n\u2032\n\n(47)\n\u2032\n\nNote that t /t defines the anisotropy of the system and typically, t /t = 0.6 \u223c 0.8 according to the\nextended H\u00fcckel band calculation [ 123, 251]. The Fermi surface in this model (Fig. 28(d)) is in good\nagreement with the result of the Shubnikov-de Haas effect. This model has a strong frustration compared\nto the case of high-Tc cuprates. It should be noticed that the Coulomb repulsion U is very small, because\na lattice cite of this model is not an atom but a dimer of molecules. However, this system is regarded\nas a strongly correlated electron system since the transfer integral t is also small. The parameter U/W\nis expected to be in the intermediate coupling region, because the system is half-filling near the Mott\ntransition. The transfer integral has been estimated from the quantum chemistry calculation [ 253] as\nt = 70 \u223c 80meV, which is just about 1/10 of the typical value in d-electron systems. Thus, Tc \u223c 10K\nagain corresponds to Tc /t \u223c 0.01, which is theoretically comparable to that for cuprate superconductors\n(Sec. 3.2).\n3.3.2. Application of the microscopic theories\nMicroscopic calculations based on the Hubbard model have been performed by using the RPA [ 254],\nFLEX approximation [ 255, 256, 257], TOP [ 20], and quantum Monte Carlo simulation [ 258]. Note that\nstrictly speaking, some small corrections on the model (47) are included in several papers, but they do\nnot affect the results, qualitatively. The above studies have concluded that (i) the pairing symmetry is\nthe dx2 \u2212y2 -wave, (ii) qualitatively the same pairing mechanism to high-Tc cuprates is expected, and (iii)\nthe comparable Tc /t \u223c 0.01 is obtained in the intermediate coupling region.\nMost of the above proposals are classified into the spin-fluctuation theory. Although the phase transition from the AF to SC state is in the first order, the strong AF spin fluctuation is observed experimentally\n[ 125, 126]. Thus, it is expected that the spin fluctuation theory can be applied in the metallic state. The\ntypical results of the FLEX approximation are shown in Fig. 29 [ 255, 256, 257]. The phase diagram in\nthe plane of t\u2032 /t and U/t is shown. The SC state appears in the neighborhood of the AF state. By increasing t\u2032 /t, the introduced frustration destroys the AF state, and then, the superconductivity appears.\nWe see that the static spin susceptibility in the normal state is strongly enhanced around q = (\u03c0, \u03c0)\nand q = (\u03c0, \u2212\u03c0) (Fig. 30). We have already shown that the scattering process exchanging the AF spin\nfluctuation is attractive for the d-wave superconductivity. The dominant scattering process is similar\n\n\f37\n\nFigure 29. The phase diagram obtained by the FLEX approximation [ 256]. The inset shows Tc for the\nvarious t\u2032 /t. Note that \u03c4 and \u03c4 \u2032 in this figure denote t and t\u2032 , respectively, in our notations.\n\nFigure 30. The spin susceptibility obtained by the FLEX approximation at T /t = 0.02. The value of U/t\nis changed as U/t = 2.5, U/t = 3.7, U/t = 5.5, and U/t = 6.5 with increasing t\u2032 /t.\n\nto that shown in Fig. 16. Thus, qualitatively the same mechanism to the high-Tc cuprates is expected\nfor the superconductivity in organic materials. Note here that the spin fluctuation-induced superconductivity in organic materials has been proposed in 80's for (TMTSF)2 X compounds [ 259, 260]. The\ntransition temperature for the superconductivity is gradually reduced by the frustration. This is because\nthe spin susceptibility becomes structure-less, and thus, the spin fluctuation mechanism is ineffective. In\nparticular, the superconductivity almost disappears in case of the isotropic triangular lattice (t\u2032 /t = 1).\nAs in high-Tc cuprates, qualitatively the same results are obtained by the TOP [ 20]. For example, the\ndx2 \u2212y2 -wave superconductivity is stabilized for t\u2032 /t \u2264 0.8. As shown in Fig. 31, Tc /t \u223c 0.01 is obtained\nin the intermediate coupling region U/t \u223c 6, corresponding to U/W \u223c 0.7. The roles of the respective\nterms are the same as those for high-Tc superconductors. The superconductivity is mainly induced by\nthe RPA-terms. The irreducible susceptibility is moderate, but has a similar tendency to the FLEX\napproximation, as is shown in Fig. 32. The non-RPA terms in the effective interaction reduce Tc .\nFigure 33 shows that Tc is reduced by the frustration and almost disappears around t\u2032 /t = 0.8. This\nfeature is also found in the result of the FLEX approximation. Thus, the anisotropy in the triangular\nlattice plays an essential role for the appearance of superconductivity. The decrease in Tc for t\u2032 /t < 0.3\nis caused by the normal self-energy, which is enhanced by the nesting nature of the Fermi surface. We\n(3VC)\nhave also shown the comparison with the result when we ignore the vertex correction term Va\n(k, k \u2032 ).\nIt is a natural conclusion that the vertex correction is more important for the strongly frustrated case.\nThis is simply because the RPA terms become ineffective and then, the non-RPA terms relatively become\neffective. In general, the spin fluctuation theory such as SCR [ 8] is justified when the Fermi surface is\nstrongly nested. Under the strong frustration, it is not allowed to ignore the vertex corrections simply.\nThus, the spin fluctuation theory is less appropriate to the \u03ba-(ET)2 X compounds for t\u2032 /t = 0.6 \u223c 0.8\nthan to the high-Tc cuprates.\nNote that the TOP and FLEX approximation commonly show that Tc increases with U . This tendency is in good agreement with the phase diagram in Fig. 8. The pressure increases the band width\n(equivalently, the transfer integral). Then, the parameter U/W , and accordingly Tc decreases with the\n\n\f38\n\nFigure 31. Tc obtained by the TOP. The results of the FLEX approximation for t\u2032 /t = 0.7 is shown for\ncomparison.\n\nFigure 32. The bare spin susceptibility for various values of t\u2032 /t.\n\napplied pressure. For the variation of anions, the frustration is enhanced from X=Cu[N(CN)2 ]Br to\nX=Cu(NCS)2 , namely in the right hand side of the phase diagram in Fig. 8 [ 261]. Therefore, the\nfrustration furthermore reduces Tc in the metallic state, combined with the chemical pressure.\nRecent FLEX calculations have pointed out that the strong dimerization is essential for the above\nresults. When the dimerization is not strong enough, the superconductivity is severely suppressed, even\nif the bonding band is below the Fermi level [ 265, 266]. In some cases, the dxy -wave symmetry is more\nfavorable, while Tc is very low [ 265]. The parameters obtained from the quantum chemistry calculation\nlocate in the boundary region between the strong and weak dimerization. We mention that the reasonable\nTc is obtained only for the strongly dimerized region. Some experimental efforts have been devoted to\nidentify the symmetry. Note that the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave symmetry has been supported by the angle-dependence\nof the high-frequency conductivity [ 267], while the dxy -wave symmetry has been supported by the thermal\nconductivity measurement [ 268] as well as the tunnelling spectroscopy [ 269].\nBefore closing this section, we comment on the other superconducting materials in the molecular conductors. Since the phonon excitation is generally strong in the organic conductors, a class of the materials\nshould be s-wave superconductor due to the electron-phonon mechanism. For instance, superconductivity\nin alkali-metal-doped fullerides A3 C60 is considered to originate from the phonon-mediated attractive interaction. However, some class of the organic superconductor can be categorized into strongly correlated\nelectron systems and the unconventional superconductivity is expected. For example, (TMTSF)PF6 is\nconsidered to be the case, where the possibility of not only the d-wave pairing, but also the triplet pairing\nhas been proposed [ 270]. The present microscopic calculations [ 260, 271, 272, 273] seem to indicate\nthe predominance of the d-wave superconductivity. We believe that the development of the microscopic\ntheory for organic materials is one of interesting future issues.\n3.4. Sr2 RuO4\nNow let us review the theoretical investigations on Sr2 RuO4 with main interests on the pairing mechanism, since interestingly this material is confirmed to be a triplet superconductor (see Sec. 2.3). The\ntriplet superconductivity has been already discovered in heavy-fermion compounds such as UPt3 [ 274].\n\n\f39\n\nFigure 33. t\u2032 /t-dependence of Tc in the TOP (circles). The squares are the results when the vertex\ncorrection in the anomalous self-energy is neglected.\n\nProbably, recently discovered uranium compounds UGe2 [ 275] and URhGe [ 276] are also the triplet\nsuperconductors, since superconductivity coexists with ferromagnetism. However, the microscopic investigation on these materials is generally difficult due to their complicated electronic structure, as will be\nshown in Sec. 5.\nOn the other hand, the electronic structure of Sr2 RuO4 is relatively simple, deduced from such points\nas two-dimensional Fermi surfaces, a few degenerate orbitals, weak spin-orbit coupling, and relatively\nweak electron correlation. Thus, both from experimental and theoretical points of view, Sr2 RuO4 is\nconsidered to be a typical compound for the microscopic investigation on the triplet superconductivity,\nwhich will provide new understanding on the unconventional superconductivity.\n3.4.1. Overview\nReferring to the successes for the pairing mechanism in cuprates and 3 He, the spin fluctuation-induced\nsuperconductivity was examined for Sr2 RuO4 at the first stage. Several authors discussed the ferromagnetic spin fluctuation, which can induce the triplet p-wave superconductivity [ 146] (see the last in\nSec. 3.2.2). Along this line, Mazin and Singh have insisted that ferromagnetic spin fluctuation is sufficiently strong to induce the triplet superconductivity in this compound [ 204, 205]. Monthoux and\nLonzarich discussed the p-wave superconductivity by phenomenologically introducing the ferromagnetic\nspin fluctuation in a square lattice model [ 202]. However, it has become apparent that the situation\nis not so simple. Neutron scattering measurement by Sidis et al. has revealed that the ferromagnetic\nfluctuation is not so enhanced. Instead of ferromagnetic fluctuation, a sizeable incommensurate AF fluctuation has been observed at the wave vector QIAF = (0.6\u03c0, 0.6\u03c0, 0) [ 14]. This incommensurate spin\nfluctuation is due to the Fermi surface nesting effect, as predicted by the band calculation with the use\nof local-density approximation (LDA) [ 205] and also derived from simpler models [ 277, 278, 279]. Under those circumstances, it has been proposed that the triplet superconductivity is possibly derived by\nassuming the strong anisotropy of the AF spin fluctuation [ 280, 281, 282]. The experimental support\nfor the strong anisotropy has been obtained from the NMR measurement [ 283], but according to the\nrecent neutron scattering experiment by Servant et al. [ 284], the spin susceptibility is very isotropic\nat q = QIAF . This discrepancy should be resolved experimentally. Theoretically, such anisotropy arises\nfrom the spin-orbit interaction in the Ru ions [ 278, 279]. It should be commented that the significant exchange enhancement is needed to explain the anisotropy observed in NMR measurement. Note also that\nthe effective interaction in the Cooper channel does not coincide with the observable spin susceptibility,\nwhen the spin-orbit interaction is explicitly taken into account [ 285]. Thus, more explicit calculation is\nrequired for this scenario in the present stage.\nTakimoto has proposed that the orbital fluctuation is important for the triplet superconductivity in\nSr2 RuO4 [ 286]. This type of fluctuation is similarly due to the nesting effect of the Fermi surface. He\nestimated the pairing interaction by using the RPA on the three-band model and obtained the following\nresults: (i) The instability to the f -wave superconductivity is generally derived by the RPA. (ii) The \u03b1\nand \u03b2 bands are mainly superconducting. (iii) The strong orbital fluctuation is necessary for the triplet\npairing to overcome the singlet one. (iv) As a result, the triplet superconductivity is stabilized, when the\ninter-orbital repulsion is larger than the intra-orbital one. Among them, the condition for (iv) is difficult\n\n\f40\n\nFigure 34. The results for the single band model [ 287]. The calculated Tc for the triplet p-wave and\nsinglet dx2 \u2212y2 -wave states.\nto be satisfied and thus, somewhat convincing evidence may be needed for the scenario based on orbital\nfluctuations.\nThe analysis based on the perturbation theory has been given on this issue [ 21, 287]. Nomura and\nYamada have expanded the effective interaction with respect to the Coulomb interaction, as has been\nperformed for high-Tc cuprates (Sec. 3.2.3) and \u03ba-(ET)2 X (Sec. 3.3.2). Precedently, several works have\ndiscussed the two-dimensional Fermi gas model within the third-order perturbation [ 288, 289]. They\nhave concluded that the p-wave pairing state is expected to provide the highest Tc . The important results\nobtained in Refs. [ 21] and [ 287] are summarized in the following: (i) The non-RPA terms neglected\nin the fluctuation theory are significantly attractive in the p-wave channel. These terms are the same\nones discussed in the two-dimensional Fermi gas model [ 289], while the singularity in the isotropic\nmodel disappears in the Hubbard model. (ii) The irreducible spin susceptibility derived from the \u03b3 band\nshows rather weak momentum dependence. This situation is in sharp contrast to high-Tc cuprates and\n\u03ba-(ET)2 X, but it is similar to the two-dimensional Fermi gas model. The results of the perturbation\ntheory and their differences from the d-wave superconductors are discussed in the next subsection. The\nfailure of the spin-fluctuation theory will be clarified there.\nRecently, Honerkamp and Salmhofer found the p-wave superconducting phase in the single-band Hubbard model on the basis of the one-loop renormalization group theory [ 290]. They have adopted a\nband structure similar to that of the \u03b3 band. According to their results, it seems that the momentum\ndependence of the effective interaction is not dominated by the ferromagnetic spin fluctuation. Rather it\nis similar to the one obtained within the naive third-order perturbation theory, in spite of the adjacent\nferromagnetic phase. Note that this renormalization group analysis has an advantage that the magnetic,\npairing, and the other instabilities can be treated on an equal footing.\n3.4.2. Perturbation theory for the triplet superconductivity\nIn this subsection the results on the perturbation theory are reviewed. First let us show the results\non the single-band Hubbard model corresponding to the \u03b3 band [ 287]. Referring to the fact that the \u03b3\nband has the largest DOS, we assume that the superconductivity is mainly determined by the \u03b3 band.\nThis assumption will be justified later from the results on the three-band model. The \u03b3 band is mainly\nconstructed from the Ru4dxy and O2p orbitals, which hybridize each other. Since the correlation effect is\ndominated by the Coulomb interactions at the Ru sites, the Hubbard model Eq. (42) can be a reasonable\nstarting point. This simplification of the model is similar to the case of high-Tc cuprates, where the d-p\nmodel is reduced to the Hubbard model. For ruthenate, the dispersion relation is given as\n\u03b5(k) = \u22122t1 (cos kx + cos ky ) \u2212 4t2 cos kx cos ky \u2212 \u03bc.\n\n(48)\n\nDue to the wave function of the 4dxy -orbitals, the sign of the next-nearest neighbor hopping is opposite\nto the case of cuprates. Note that the unit such as t1 = 1 is used in this subsection.\nIn Fig. 34, we show Tc obtained by the TOP for the p- and dx2 \u2212y2 -wave superconductivity. We can see\nthat the triplet pairing is more stable than the singlet one for the electron filling n = 1.33, corresponding\nto the case of Sr2 RuO4 [ 139]. On the other hand, the singlet pairing gives higher Tc near the half-filling.\nThis is because the AF component of the spin fluctuation is enhanced and induces the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave\nsuperconductivity. The latter situation corresponds to the case of cuprate superconductors. Thus, the\n\n\f41\n\nFigure 35. The eigenvalue \u03bbe in the triplet channel [ 292]. The temperature is fixed to T = 0.005 (\u223c 15K).\nThen, \u03bbe \u223c 0.4 corresponds to the experimental value of Tc \u223c1.5K by the extrapolation. Here, the normal\nself-energy is ignored for simplicity.\n\nelectron number away from the half-filling is essential for the appearance of the triplet superconductivity.\nThe transition temperature in the triplet channel increases with the electron number. This trend is\nconsistent with the recent experiment [ 291]. This n-dependence of Tc is dominated by the effective\ninteraction [ 292], not by the electronic DOS.\nLet us explain the detailed roles of the respective terms in the perturbation expansion [ 292]. It should\nbe noted that the RPA terms cancel each other and do not appear in the third-order term of Vat (k, k \u2032 )\n(Eqs. (27)- (29)). That is, all of the third-order terms are non-RPA terms. In the present case, both\nthe second- and third-order terms are attractive in the triplet channel. Namely, the RPA- and non-RPA\nterms cooperatively induce the triplet superconductivity. In contrast to high-Tc cuprates, however, the\ncontribution from the RPA term is not large, since the momentum dependence of \u03c70 (q) is insignificant.\nOn the other hand, the momentum dependence of the third-order terms are particularly attractive. Figure\n35 shows the development of the eigenvalue of the \u00c9liashberg equation in various calculations. We can\nsee that the contribution from the third-order terms is important even in the moderately weak-coupling\nregion; it overcomes the contribution from the second-order term around U \u223c 3, where the experimental\nTc = 1.5K is obtained. Thus, an important role of the non-RPA terms is expected for the appearance\nof the triplet superconductivity. We have confirmed that the averaged magnitude of the third-order\nterm is still 1/3 of the second-order term in this region, which does not contradict with the perturbative\ntreatment adopted here. The effect of the higher-order corrections will be discussed in Appendix B.\nOn the other hand, the RPA gives the observed value of Tc \u223c 1.5K only in the vicinity of the meanfield magnetic instability (U = 2). This is mainly because the RPA term is not so suitable to the triplet\npairing and the magnetic order is significantly overestimated in the RPA. It is also important that the\ncontribution from the magnetic fluctuation to the triplet pairing is 1/3 of that to the singlet pairing (see\nEqs. (33) and (34)). Note that this situation is not improved in the FLEX approximation, as is shown\nin the figure. This is mainly because the de-pairing effect is very strong, when the spin fluctuation has a\nlocal nature, namely, nearly q-independent. We have pointed out in Sec. 3.2 that the de-pairing effect is\nusually overestimated in the FLEX approximation, which is quite serious for the \u03b3 band just due to the\nlocal nature of the spin fluctuation. Also from this reason, the spin fluctuation theory is not suitable for\nthe \u03b3 band. In fact, the \u03b1 and \u03b2 bands provide larger value of \u03bbe in the FLEX approximation at U > 2.5,\nwhere the spin susceptibility has a sharp peak around q \u223c QIAF . The obtained \u03bbe in this case is shown\nin Fig. 35, but too small to lead to the observed value such as Tc \u223c 1.5K. These comparisons with the\nspin fluctuation theory indicate the importance of the non-RPA term. The results of the perturbation\ntheory have supported this indication. Note that the TOP is the lowest-order theory for the non-RPA\nterms.\nHere we comment on the roles of the perturbative terms in the singlet channel. They are qualitatively\nthe same as in the previous subsections for high-Tc cuprates and organic superconductors. However, there\nis one significant difference; the third-order term is totally repulsive in the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave channel. That\nis, the vertex corrections completely suppress the RPA terms in the third order. It is expected that the\nspin-fluctuation theory loses its justification in this case. The electron filling far from the half-filling is\nalso essential for this conclusion.\n\n\f42\n\nFigure 36. The results for the three-band model [ 21]. The calculated Tc for the spin-triplet superconductivity at nl = 1.4. (a) |J|=|J \u2032 |=0.667U \u2032. (b) |J|=|J \u2032 |=U \u2032 .\nWe have compared in detail the stability of the p-wave, dx2 \u2212y2 -wave, and dxy -wave superconductivity [\n292]. We found that the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave symmetry is most stable within the SOP, but the p-wave symmetry\nbecomes stable owing to the third-order terms even in the rather weak-coupling region (U \u2265 1.5). Note\nthat if we increase the electron number furthermore, the p-wave symmetry is most stable even in the\nSOP. In other words, the parameter region stabilizing the triplet superconductivity is obtained in the\nlowest-order theory and it is much enlarged in the TOP.\nIn the next stage, the discussion is extended to the three band model [ 21], given by\nH = H0 + H \u2032 ,\n\n(49)\n\nwhere H0 is written as\nX\nX\nH0 =\n\u03b5l (k)c\u2020k,l,s ck,l,s +\ng(k)(c\u2020k,yz,s ck,xz,s + h.c.) + HLS ,\n\n(50)\n\nwith the spin-orbit coupling term\nX\nLi * SSi .\nHLS = 2\u03bb\n\n(51)\n\nk,l,s\n\nk,s\n\ni\n\nThe Coulomb interaction term H \u2032 is given by\nX\nX\nX\n1\nH\u2032 = U\nni,l,\u2191 ni,l,\u2193 + U \u2032\nni,l ni,l\u2032 + J\n(2SSi,l SSi,l\u2032 + ni,l ni,l\u2032 )\n2\ni,l\ni,l>l\u2032\ni,l>l\u2032\nX \u2020\n+J \u2032\nci,l,\u2193 c\u2020i,l,\u2191 ci,l\u2032 ,\u2191 ci,l\u2032 ,\u2193 ,\n\n(52)\n\ni,l6=l\u2032\n\nwhere l denote the Wannier states (xy, yz, xz) corresponding to the Ru(4dxy , 4dyz , 4dxz ) orbitals. The\nband dispersions are chosen as\n\u03b5xy (k)\n\u03b5yz (k)\n\u03b5xz (k)\ng(k)\n\n= \u22122t1 (coskx + cosky ) \u2212 4t2 coskx cosky \u2212 \u03bcxy ,\n\n(53)\n\n= 4t5 sinkx sinky .\n\n(56)\n\n= \u22122t3 cosky \u2212 2t4 coskx \u2212 \u03bcyz ,\n= \u22122t3 coskx \u2212 2t4 cosky \u2212 \u03bcxz ,\n\n(54)\n(55)\n\nFor the present calculation, we take (t1 , t2 , t3 , t4 , t5 ) = (1.0, 0.4, 1.25, 0.125, 0.2). Under these parameters,\nthe kinetic energy term H0 well reproduces the three Fermi surfaces observed by the de Haas-van Alphen\neffect [ 139]. The last term in Eq. (50) is the spin-orbit interaction in the Ru ions, which plays an\nessential role in stabilizing the chiral superconductivity. We will discuss this subject in Sec. 3.4.3. For\nthe time being, we ignore this term for simplicity. The interaction term H \u2032 represents the on-site Coulomb\ninteractions including the intra-band repulsion U , inter-band repulsion U \u2032 , Hund's coupling term J, and\npair hopping term J \u2032 . The parameters satisfy the relation U > U \u2032 > |J| \u223c |J \u2032 | and J < 0 in the ordinary\nsituation.\n\n\f43\n\nFigure 37.

The parameters are chosen as U = 3.385, U \u2032 = |J| = |J \u2032 | = 0.5U , and T = 0.003.\nIn (d), the gap magnitude on each Fermi surface is shown as a function of the inplane azimuthal angle \u03c6\nwith respect to the Ru-O bonding direction (The numerical data is from the work in Ref. [ 294]). Here\nwe have assumed that the orbital symmetry of the pairs is represented by kx \u00b1 iky and the unit of energy\nis about 4500K.\n\nt\nFigure 38. Contour-plots of the effective interaction on the \u03b3 band for (a) the triplet channel, V\u03b3,\u03b3\n(k, k \u2032 )\ns\n(k, k \u2032 ) [ 21]. Here the Matsubara frequency is chosen as k0 = k0\u2032 = i\u03c0T\nand (b) the singlet channel, V\u03b3,\u03b3\nand k\u2032 is fixed as pointed by the arrow. The parameters are chosen as U = 3.385, U \u2032 = |J| = |J \u2032 | = 0.5U\nand T = 0.007.\n\nWe similarly expand the normal and anomalous self-energies up to the third order with respect to H \u2032 ,\nand determine the superconducting instability by solving the \u00c9liashberg equation extended to the multiband system. Then, the mixing term with coupling constant t5 is approximately treated for simplicity.\nAs for details, readers can refer Ref. [ 21]. As will be mentioned below, this procedure does not affect\nseriously the calculated results for Tc , which is shown in Fig. 36. We obtain the qualitatively same results\nas those for the single band model. The inter-band interactions enhance Tc further, which takes the value\nTc \u223c 0.003 \u223c 10K in the moderate coupling region U = 3 \u223c 4. The realistic value Tc = 1.5K should be\nobtained in the weaker coupling region. Note here that we restrict the calculation above T \u2265 0.003t1 in\norder to avoid the finite size effects.\nFigure 37 shows the momentum dependence of the anomalous self-energy \u2206a (k, i\u03c0T ) (a = \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3).\nThis figure clearly shows that the pairing symmetry is p-wave. An important point to be noted is that\nthe \u03b3 band has the largest magnitude of the anomalous self-energy. It is suggested that the condensation\nenergy is mainly gained in the \u03b3 band. We can show that this situation is very robust for Sr2 RuO4 [\n292]. That is, the magnitude of the anomalous self-energy remarkably depends on the band. Agterberg\net al. have proposed this situation, called \"orbital dependent superconductivity\" (ODS) [ 293]. In the\npresent case, the \u03b3 band is mainly superconducting, because the DOS is largest in \u03b3. If we adopt the\nsmall t3 , the \u03b1 and \u03b2 bands have larger DOS. Then, the situation is converse. In the realistic case,\nsuperconductivity is dominated by the \u03b3 band and the contribution from the other bands are small. This\nis the physical background by which the theoretical approach based on the single-band model is justified.\nThe approximate treatment for the mixing term g(k) is simultaneously justified, because this term only\ncouples the \u03b1 and \u03b2 bands.\n\n\f44\nIn order to clarify the leading scattering process in the Cooper channel, we show the contour-plots of\nthe effective interactions on the \u03b3-band (Fig. 38). It is shown that the effective interaction in the triplet\nt\nchannel V\u03b3,\u03b3\n(k, k \u2032 ) takes the large value around k \u2248 \u2212k\u2032 . This characteristic momentum dependence\nmainly originates from the third-order terms and is attractive for the triplet pairing. This nature is in\ncommon with that of the single-band model. Figure 38(b) shows that the characteristic peak appears in\ns\nthe effective interaction in the singlet channel V\u03b3,\u03b3\n(k, k \u2032 ) around k = k\u2032 + QIAF . These peaks arise from\nthe nesting nature of the quasi-one-dimensional Fermi surfaces, namely \u03b1 and \u03b2 bands. This momentum\ndependence appears through the inter-orbital interactions and favors the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave state. Thus, the\nsinglet pairing is enhanced by the multi-band effect. Although the triplet pairing is relatively suppressed\nby the multi-band effect, such an effect is not significant when the inter-orbital interactions are small\ncompared with the intra-band one.\nFinally let us comment on the understanding of the power-law behaviors below Tc [ 150, 156, 157,\n158, 159, 160] on the basispof the above results. Below Tc , the Bogoliubov quasi-particle energy is\nobtained as Ea (k) = za (k) \u03b5a (k)2 + \u2206a (k)2 . Here za (k) is the renormalization factor for the a-band\nR\nand \u2206a (k) = |\u2206R\na (k, Ea (k))|, where \u2206a (k) is the analytic continuation of \u2206a (k). If we consider the weak\ncoupling case, i.e., (Tc , \u2206a (k)) \u226a W , an approximation \u2206a (k) \u2243 |\u2206a (k, i\u03c0T )| becomes very accurate\naround the Fermi surface. Therefore, the momentum and orbital dependence of the excitation gap is\nobtained from |\u2206a (k, i\u03c0T )|, except for the factor arising from za (k). Since we found that the a and\nk-dependence of za (k) is not outstanding in Sr2 RuO4 , the qualitative nature of the excitation spectrum\nbelow Tc is captured by Fig. 37. Strictly speaking, the momentum and orbital dependence of \u2206a (k) is\ndeformed below Tc . However, this deformation is usually small in the weak-coupling region Tc \u226a W [\n146]. Note that the anisotropy of the excitation gap tends to be smeared below Tc .\nAs shown in Fig. 37, the momentum dependence of the anomalous self-energy is highly anisotropic and\ncannot be fitted by the simple form \u2206(k) = sin kx and so on. Recently, we have successfully shown that the\ngap structure derived in the present formulation is consistent with the power-law behavior of the specific\n\u02c6\nheat [ 294]. A node-like structure on the \u03b2 Fermi surface remains in the chiral state d(k)\n= (kx \u00b1 iky )\u1e91\nand results in the power-law behavior at low temperature. Combination with the \"orbital dependent\nsuperconductivity\" gives a whole temperature dependence, in agreement with experiments, although a\nfitting of the parameters is required. Thus, the power-law behaviors and the time reversal symmetry\nbreaking can coexist within the two-dimensional model. One of the remaining problems is to clarify\nwhether or not the other experimental results, such as the NMR 1/T1 T [ 150], magnetic field penetration\ndepth [ 157], thermal conductivity [ 158, 159], and ultrasonic attenuation rate [ 160] can be consistently\nexplained.\n3.4.3. Identification of the internal degree of freedom\nIn this subsection, we discuss the subject concerning the internal degree of freedom in the triplet superconductivity. Since the triplet superconductivity has the spin degree of freedom, an internal degeneracy\nremains under the crystal field. The spin part of the order parameter is assigned by the d-vector as\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u2206\u2191\u2191 (k) \u2206\u2191\u2193 (k)\n\u2212dx (k) + idy (k)\ndz (k)\n\u02c6\n=\n= id(k)\u03c3\u0302\u03c3\n(57)\ny.\n\u2206\u2193\u2191 (k) \u2206\u2193\u2193 (k)\ndz (k)\ndx (k) + idy (k)\nAccording to the tetragonal crystal symmetry, six eigenstates are degenerate in the calculation in Sec. 3.4.2,\nbecause we have ignored the spin-orbit interaction described in the last term of Eq. (50). This degeneracy is lifted by the spin-orbit interaction and classified into four one-dimensional representations and a\ntwo-dimensional representation [ 12, 152].\nThe internal structure in the superconductivity is an attractive character which does not usually exist in\nthe singlet pairing. Since the SC state is characterized by this structure, both theoretical and experimental\ninterests are widely stimulated. Owing to the internal degree of freedom, the multiple phase diagram can\nappear, as has been found in 3 He and UPt3 , to which many theoretical investigations have been devoted [\n12, 146, 295, 296]. For 3 He, the weak dipole interaction works as the leading spin-orbit interaction which\nstabilizes the A-phase near Tc and explains the interesting properties in the NMR shift [ 146]. For the\nsuperconducting materials, the internal degree of freedom has been discussed in the phenomenological\nlevel [ 12, 295, 296], which classifies the possible eigenstates and provides some experimental methods to\nidentify the internal structure. It has been difficult to develop the microscopic theory on this issue, since\nthe previous triplet superconductors are basically heavy-fermion systems. We have expected that the\n\n\f45\nrelatively simple electronic structure makes Sr2 RuO4 to be the first example of such microscopic study.\nHere we show that such investigation provides some interesting conclusions [ 292].\nThe experimental investigation on the multiple phase diagram does not seem to be completed for\nSr2 RuO4 . It has been discovered that the second phase appears in the low-temperature and high\nmagnetic-field region with H being precisely parallel to the plane [ 297]. The property of this second\nphase is not identified up to now. Recently, NMR measurement has been performed to resolve the nature\nunder the perpendicular field [ 298]. Then, the d-vector perpendicular to the z-axis is indicated under the\nhigh field. The stabilized state under the zero magnetic field has been identified experimentally. It has\n\u02c6 = (kx \u00b1 iky )\u1e91 is\nbeen revealed from the phenomenological argument [ 152] that only the chiral state d(k)\nconsistent with the present experiments [ 4, 145, 147, 151]. Here, our microscopic analysis is focused on\nthe internal structure under the zero magnetic field. The microscopic mechanism of the chiral superconductivity has been one of important issues, and the resolution of the internal structure will indicate the\nphase diagram under the magnetic field.\nFirst we briefly explain the formulation. The matrix representation of the kinetic energy term H0 is\ndescribed as\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\u03b5yz (k)\nig(k) \u2212 s\u03bb \u2212s\u03bb\nck,yz,s\n\u0011\nX\u0010 \u2020\n\uf8f8 \uf8ed ck,xz,s \uf8f8 .

(58) as \u01240 (k, s). Note that a constant phase factor is multiplied to the\n4dxz orbital in order to simplify the notation. This definition makes the pair hopping term J \u2032 negative\nbetween the 4dxz and other orbitals. We ignore the hybridization term g(k) in the following, since this\nterm is not important when the \u03b3 band is mainly superconducting. We can show that the conclusions\nare not affected even if the \u03b1 and \u03b2 bands are mainly superconducting [ 292].\nNew quasi-particles are obtained by diagonalizing the matrix \u01240 (k, s) through the unitary transformation. This procedure corresponds to the transformation of the basis as (a\u2020k,1,s , a\u2020k,2,s , a\u2020k,3,s ) =\n(c\u2020k,yz,s , c\u2020k,xz,s , c\u2020k,xy,\u2212s )\u00db (k, s). New quasi-particles created by the operators a\u2020k,l,s are characterized by\nthe pseudo-orbital l and pseudo-spin s. The Fermi surface of the new quasi-particle is consistent with the\nquantum oscillation measurement [ 139]. The rotational symmetry in the spin space is violated by the\nspin-orbit interaction. The anisotropy of the spin susceptibility is derived from this effect [ 278, 279, 292].\nWe calculate the scattering vertex \u0393(k, k \u2032 , a, a\u2032 , b\u2032 , b, s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 ) in the Cooper channel by using the old\nbasis tentatively, and then, apply the unitary transformation in order to obtain the effective interactions\nin the new basis,\n\u0393\u0303(k, k \u2032 , \u03b1, \u03b1\u2032 , \u03b2 \u2032 , \u03b2, s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 ) =\nX\nu\u2217a,\u03b1 (k, s1 )u\u2217a\u2032 ,\u03b1\u2032 (\u2212k, s2 )\u0393(k, k \u2032 , a, a\u2032 , b\u2032 , b, s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 )ub\u2032 ,\u03b2 \u2032 (\u2212k\u2032 , s3 )ub,\u03b2 (k\u2032 , s4 ),\n\n(59)\n\na,a\u2032 ,b,b\u2032\n\nwhere we redefine the up (down) spin in 4dxy -orbital as s = \u22121 (s = 1). It should be noticed that\nmany terms are added to the scattering vertex \u0393(k, k \u2032 , a, a\u2032 , b\u2032 , b, s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 ) through the off-diagonal\nGreen functions. Moreover, we have to calculate the off-diagonal part, because it contributes through the\nunitary transformation. The diagonal part with respect to the pseudo-orbital \u1e7c\u03b1,\u03b2 (k, k \u2032 , s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 ) =\n\u0393\u0303(k, k \u2032 , \u03b1, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b2, s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 ) contributes to the superconducting instability. As a result, the \u00c9liashberg\nequation is extended in the following way:\nX\n(60)\n\u03bbe \u2206\u03b1,s1 ,s2 (k) = \u2212\n\u1e7c\u03b1,\u03b2 (k, k \u2032 , s2 , s1 , s3 , s4 )|G\u0303\u03b2 (k \u2032 )|2 \u2206\u03b2,s3 ,s4 (k \u2032 ).\n\u03b2,k\u2032 ,s3 ,s4\n\nHowever, the full calculation for this equation is very tedious, since the effective interaction \u1e7c\u03b1,\u03b2 (k, k \u2032 , s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 )\nincludes lots of terms. Then, we simplify the calculation by using two additional approximations: One is\nthe perturbation with respect to the spin-orbit coupling \u03bb and the other is based on the ODS argument.\nSince the spin-orbit interaction in Sr2 RuO4 is much smaller than the band width, the perturbation with\nrespect to \u03bb is very accurate. We find that the first-order term vanishes and the second-order term is the\nlowest order. We restrict the estimation within this order. The practical procedure has been explained\nin Ref. [ 292]. We can show that the ODS is very robust in Sr2 RuO4 , while the main band depends\n\n\f46\n\nFigure 39. The stabilized state in the perturbation theory. Circles and triangles represent the state\n(3) and (1), respectively. The solid line shows the realistic value n\u03b3 = 1.33. The Fermi surface is\nelectron(hole)-like in the left (right) side of the dashed line. The parameters are chosen as U = 5,\nU \u2032 = 0.3U and |J \u2032 | = |J| = 0.2U .\n\non the parameters [ 292]. Then, the eigenvalue \u03bbe is almost determined by the interaction between the\nmain orbital. Therefore, it is sufficient to take into account only the diagonal part of the interaction\n\u1e7c\u03b1 (k, k \u2032 , s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 ) = \u1e7c\u03b1,\u03b1 (k, k \u2032 , s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 ), and investigate each case where the main pseudo-orbital\nis \u03b1 = 1, 2 or 3.\nFinally, the eigenstates are classified by using the d-vector representation. We find the following\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\neigenstates: (1) d(k)\n= kx x\u0302 \u00b1 ky \u0177, (2) d(k)\n= kx \u0177 \u00b1 ky x\u0302, and (3) d(k)\n= (kx \u00b1 iky )\u1e91 with remained\ntwo-fold degeneracy. Although other linear combinations are possible, we have chosen the symmetric\nstates, which are expected to be stabilized in order to gain the condensation energy. The degeneracy in\n(1) and that in (2) is finally lifted by the weak mixing term g(k), but the main results are not affected\nby this effect [ 292].\nWe estimate the eigenvalue \u03bbe for each eigenstate (1)-(3) and regard the state with maximum Tc\nto be stabilized. This procedure is surely correct around T \u223c Tc . In order to estimate \u0393, we use the\nperturbation method with respect to the interaction term H \u2032 and take into account all of the second-order\nterms as well as the third-order term with coupling constant U 3 . This approximation is justified when\n|J \u2032 |, |J|, U \u2032 < U < W . We include the third-order term in the estimation because it is important for the\npairing mechanism, as is explained in Sec. 3.4.2. The results on the d-vector are almost not affected by\nthe third-order terms since they do not lift the internal degeneracy.\nNow let us show the results by the fully microscopic calculation. We find that the \"symmetry breaking\ninteraction\", which violates the SU(2) symmetry in the d-vector space, requires the Hund's coupling term\nJ. Considering that the superconductivity is mainly induced by the intra-orbital repulsion U , we conclude\nthat the triplet superconductivity and the chiral superconductivity have a quite different origin. In the\npresent case, the cross-term with coefficient U J is the leading contribution to the \"symmetry breaking\ninteraction\" and stabilizes the d-vector parallel to the z-axis. Figure 39 shows the phase diagram with\nrespect to the parameter t2 /t1 and the electron number in the \u03b3 band. We can see that the chiral\nstate (3) is robustly stabilized in the experimentally relevant region, t2 /t1 \u223c 0.4 and n\u03b3 \u223c 1.33. The\nother state (1) also appears, but only in the experimentally irrelevant case where the \u03b3-Fermi surface is\nhole-like. The difference of Tc for each eigenstate is estimated as 2 \u223c 4%, if we put the parameters as\n2\u03bb = 0.1eV and W = 2eV. This value seems to be surprisingly small, but this is a natural result, since\nthe \"symmetry breaking interaction\" is in the second order with respect to \u03bb. Note that the chiral state\n(3) is not stabilized, if the \u03b1 and \u03b2 bands are mainly superconducting. We find that the state (2) is more\nstable there.\nHere we comment on the phase diagram under the magnetic field. Since the d-vector along the z-axis\nis stabilized under zero magnetic field, the parallel magnetic field does not alter the d-vector. Thus, the\nsecond phase transition observed under the parallel magnetic field is not the rotation of the d-vector.\n\u02c6 = (kx \u00b1 ikx )\u1e91 or\nThis phenomenon may be a transition within the two-dimensional representation d(k)\nthat of the vortex configuration. Our estimation indicates that the d-vector can be altered by the small\nmagnetic field along the z-axis, since the splitting of the degeneracy is small. While the Hc2 is small\nin this direction as Hc2 \u223c 0.07Tesla, our estimation for splitting of the degeneracy corresponds to the\n\n\f47\n\u03b3-band\n(kx \u00b1 iky )\u1e91\nnone\n(kx2 \u2212 ky2 )(ky x\u0302 \u00b1 kx \u0177)\nkx ky (kx x\u0302 \u00b1 ky \u0177)\n\n\u03b1-, \u03b2-band\nky x\u0302 \u00b1 kx \u0177\nky x\u0302 \u00b1 kx \u0177\n(kx2 \u2212 ky2 )(kx x\u0302 \u00b1 ky \u0177)\nnone\n\np-wave\np-wave (with node)\nfx2 \u2212y2 -wave\nfxy -wave\nTable 1\nStabilized state for each symmetry and main band.\n\nmagnetic field H \u223c 0.1Tesla. Since our estimation includes ambiguity in the order unity, the d-vector\nperpendicular to the z-direction is possible in the high-field region.\nIn the next stage, we compare several pairing states from the viewpoint of the internal degree of\nfreedom. Assuming the pairing symmetry and the main band, we investigate which pairing state is\nstabilized in the respective case. Then, the \"symmetry breaking interaction\" is microscopically estimated\nwithin the lowest order. We believe that this semi-phenomenological comparison is meaningful, for which\nthe applicability of the perturbation theory may be wider. This is because the perturbation series of the\n\"symmetry breaking interaction\" has smaller coefficient than the total effective interaction. The obtained\nresults will restrict the possible pairing symmetry, which is consistent with the time-reversal symmetry\nbreaking [ 151]. We restrict the discussion to the two-dimensional model, because the three-dimensional\npairing state is hardly promising.\nThe obtained results are summarized in Table 1, where the stabilized state is shown for each pairing\nsymmetry. We see that the chiral state is stabilized only when the symmetry is the p-wave and the main\nband is \u03b3. The other paring states including the f -wave symmetry [ 286, 299, 300] provide other d-vector,\nwhich is incompatible with the time-reversal symmetry breaking. After all, it is concluded that the most\nfavorable pairing state is the p-wave on the \u03b3-band, as expected in the perturbation theory. In other\nwords, the perturbation theory provides the probable pairing symmetry and furthermore the compatible\nd-vector along the \u1e91-axis.\nHere we point out that our systematic treatment for the spin-orbit interaction is necessary to discuss the\ninternal degree of freedom. The spin-orbit interaction contributes to the symmetry breaking interaction\nthrough (i) the virtual process in the effective interaction and (ii) the unitary transformation of the\nquasi-particles. When the chiral state is stabilized, the dominant contribution comes from the cross-term\nof (i) and (ii). Thus, we have to treat the two effects on the same footing. The estimation of the effect\n(i) only [ 285] or the effect (ii) only [ 301] may be inadequate in the microscopic theory. We should\nfurther mention that the effective interaction derived here is quite different from the phenomenological\nassumption in Ref. [ 301]. Indeed, the chiral state is not stabilized, if we take account of only the effect\n(ii).\nAt the last of this section, we comment on the heavy-fermion superconductor UPt3 , which is a spintriplet superconductor exhibiting three different superconducting phases under the magnetic field. The\nphase diagram has been explained by assuming the weak spin-orbit interaction [ 295] because this assumption is necessary to explain the NMR Knight shift [ 13]. However, this assumption has raised a\nserious question, since the spin-orbit coupling is generally strong in the heavy-fermion system [ 296]. We\nthink that the result obtained here gives a clue to this question. It has been shown that the Hund's\ncoupling term is required for the violation of the SU(2) symmetry in the d-vector space. On the contrary,\nthe SU(2) symmetry in the real spin space is violated even for J = 0; the spin susceptibility is anisotropic,\nfor example. Therefore, the violation of the SU(2) symmetry can be much smaller in the d-vector space\nthan in the real spin space. In other words, it is possible that the anisotropy is almost absorbed in the\ncharacter of the quasi-particles, and only a weak anisotropy is remained in the residual interaction. The\nexamination of this possibility for UPt3 will be an interesting future issue.\n\n\f48\n4. Pseudogap Phenomena\n4.1. Overview\nIn this section, we discuss the normal-state properties of high-Tc cuprates. As we have noted in\nthe review of the experimental results in Sec. 2.1 [ 54], many anomalous aspects of the normal state\nhave been central issues of high-Tc superconductors. We should clarify the nature of the normal state,\nbecause the comprehensive understanding of the whole phase diagram is highly desirable. Among them,\nthe pseudogap phenomena, which are widely observed in the optimally- to under-doped region (see\nFig. 1), have attracted much interests. Since the superconductivity arises through the pseudogap state\nin optimally- and under-doped systems, the resolution of the pseudogap state is an essential subject for\nthe high-Tc superconductivity. Furthermore, the pseudogap phenomena have many interesting aspects,\nbecause they are in sharp contrast to the conventional Fermi-liquid theory [ 302]. The unusual nature\nhas indicated an appearance of a new concept in the condensed matter physics.\nThe introduction of our understanding on this issue is one of the purposes of this review. Among many\ntheoretical proposals, we have adopted the \"pairing scenario\" in which the pseudogap is a precursor of\nthe superconducting (SC) gap. This scenario has been indicated by several experimental results, as have\nbeen explained in Sec. 2.1. Since there are several kinds of \"pairing scenario\", we will explain later them\nsomewhat in detail to avoid confusion. Before introducing the pairing scenarios, we briefly review other\nscenarios, which have been widely investigated.\nAn interesting proposal is the appearance of the RVB state [ 24, 25]. Historically, the RVB theory was\nproposed for the quantum spin system with frustration [ 303]. Motivated by the high-Tc superconductivity,\nthe superconductivity arising from the RVB state has been investigated intensively [ 304, 305, 306,\n307, 308, 309, 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318]. Naively speaking, the spin-liquid state\nis the underlying state which results in the superconductivity if holes are lightly doped. Among the\nseveral descriptions, the slave-boson method for the t-J model has been widely used [ 308, 311, 312].\nIn this theory, two essential excitations, spinon and holon, appear in the mean-field level and couple\nthrough a gauge field. The pseudogap state is regarded as a singlet pairing state of the spinons and the\nsuperconductivity is described as Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of the holons. Some characteristics\nof the pseudogap state as well as the whole phase diagram are reproduced within the mean-field theory.\nThe electric transport is explained by taking account of the U(1) gauge field [ 315, 316]. The gauge-field\ntheory has been extended to the SU(2) symmetry [ 318]. These approaches are essentially from the Mott\ninsulating state. The metallic state is described as a \"doped Mott insulator\". This starting point is\ncontrastive to our approach from the Fermi-liquid state.\nAnother class of the proposal is the \"hidden order scenario\", where some long-range order exists in\nthe pseudogap state. For example, the anti-ferromagnetism [ 249, 319] and the \"stripe\" order [ 320] have\nbeen proposed as candidates. Recently, \"the d-density wave\" has been proposed as a new type of the\nlong-range order [ 321]. If a finite value of some \"hidden\" order parameter is confirmed experimentally,\nthe corresponding scenario will be the best candidate, but it is not the case up to now.\nIn other class of the scenarios, a fluctuation of the order parameter is considered as an origin of the\npseudogap. The fluctuation-induced pseudogap has been investigated from the old days [ 322]. Then,\nthe (quasi-) one-dimensional Peierls transition was mainly investigated [ 323, 324, 325]. Since any longrange order does not exist at finite temperature, an extraordinary wide critical region is expected in\none dimension. The pseudogap in the spectrum is expected as a precursor of the long-range order.\nThis mechanism may be generally expected in the low-dimensional system. The pairing scenario is also\nclassified into the case. Another candidate is the AF spin-fluctuation [ 188, 195, 223, 326, 327, 328]. The\npseudogap in the single-particle spectrum can be derived from the spin-fluctuation theory. The pseudogap\nfirst opens at the \"hot spot\", which is qualitatively consistent with experiments. A naive and crucial\nproblem is on the magnetic excitation which is observed in the NMR and neutron scattering (Sec. 2.1.2).\nIt will be a subject how the decrease of the magnetic excitation is derived from the magnetic fluctuation\nitself. An alternative understanding for the comprehensive phase diagram is proposed by Emery et al. [\n329] on the basis of the fluctuating \"stripe\" state. In the Emery's proposal, the proximity effect from the\ninsulating region induces the spin gap.\nNow let us introduce the pairing scenarios, which are classified into some kinds. Because this concept is\nadopted in this review, a detailed explanation is given, including the related theories. The superconducting phase transition is usually described by the BCS theory which is an established mean-field theory. As\n\n\f49\n\nFigure 40. The correction to the thermodynamic potential in the NSR theory.\n\nis well known, the superconducting correlation does not appear above Tc within the mean-field theory.\nTherefore, we have to consider the breakdown of the BCS theory in order to discuss the pairing scenario.\nThere are following two origins for the breakdown. One is the strong-coupling superconductivity and\nthe other is the low-dimensionality. The justification of the BCS theory is based on the long coherence\nlength, which is \u03be0 = 102 \u223c 103 in the conventional superconductors and makes the fluctuation negligible. However, the strong-coupling nature of the superconductivity results in the short coherence length,\nwhich causes the softening of the fluctuation. Here, the coupling of the superconductivity is indicated\nby the parameter TcMF /EF , which determines the coherence length in the clean limit. Note that the\nnon-s-wave superconductivity is always clean. Here, TcMF is the transition temperature in the mean-field\ntheory and EF is the Fermi energy renormalized by the electron correlation. The fluctuation is generally\nenhanced by the low-dimensionality. In the strictly two-dimensional case, Tc is always zero according to\nthe Mermin-Wagner theorem, expect for the KT transition. Then, wide critical region is expected even\nin the weak-coupling case. While the three-dimensional long-range order occurs owing to the inter-layer\ncoupling, the quasi-two-dimensionality induces the strong fluctuation. These two conditions are surely\nsatisfied in the high-Tc cuprates, where \u03be0 = 3 \u223c 5.\nThe first proposal of the pairing scenario was based on the Nozi\u00e8res and Schmitt-Rink (NSR) theory\n[ 330, 331], where the central subject is the cross-over problem from the BCS superconductivity to the\nBose-Einstein condensation (BEC). In the weak-coupling region, the Cooper-pairing and phase coherence\noccur at the same time according to the BCS theory. In contrast to that, in the strong-coupling limit, the\nfermions construct pre-formed bosons above Tc and the BEC occurs at Tc . The latter situation is called\n\"real space pairing\" in contrast to the \"momentum space pairing\" in the BCS theory. The cross-over\nof two regions was first formulated at T = 0 by Leggett [ 330] and extended to the finite temperature\nby Nozi\u00e8res and Schmitt-Rink [ 331]. After that, the application to the two-dimensional system has\nbeen investigated [ 332, 333, 334, 335]. These two regions are continuously described by adjusting the\nchemical potential. We note that this argument does not prohibit the phase transition. The first-order\nphase transition with phase separation has been reported in the dynamical mean-field theory [ 336, 337].\nThe NSR theory at finite temperature takes the lowest-order correction to the thermodynamic potential\n(\u03a9B ), which is shown in Fig. 40. The particle number is obtained as n = nF + nB , where nF is the usual\nFermion contribution and nB is the contribution from the fluctuation, namely nB = \u2212\u2202\u03a9B /\u2202\u03bc. The\nchemical potential is set below the conduction band in the strong-coupling region. Then, the fermionic\nexcitation is fully gapped even in the anisotropic superconductivity [ 330]. In this limit, the system\nis regarded as a bosonic system with residual interactions. It should be noted that the NSR theory is\nbasically justified in the low-density system, since the shift of the chemical potential is the leading effect\nin the low-density limit.\nWhen the BCS-BEC cross-over was proposed for the pseudogap phenomenon [ 338, 339, 340], the\npseudogap state was regarded as a cross-over region. The strong-coupling limit is evidently not relevant for\ncuprates, because the excitation is clearly gapless along the diagonal direction. Note here that this picture\nis adopted in the phenomenological theories which assume the coexistence of the fermions and bosons [\n341, 342, 343]. By taking advantage of this proposal, intensive studies have been devoted to the cross-over\nproblem [ 338, 339, 340, 344, 345, 346, 347, 348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354]. For example, the description\nbeyond the original NSR theory has been given by the self-consistent T-matrix (SCT) approximation [\n\n\f50\n344] and by the pairing approximation [ 353, 354]. The electronic spectrum has been calculated for the\nessentially low-density model by the T-matrix approach [ 348, 355, 356, 357, 358, 359, 360]. In particular,\nJanko et al. have shown that the pseudogap in the single-particle spectrum appears near the cross-over\nregion in the 3D jellium model. Then, the importance of the self-energy correction has been pointed out.\nThe quantum Monte Carlo simulation has been performed as a non-perturbative method for the same\nproblem [ 361, 362, 363, 364, 365, 366, 367]. Then, the results in the strong-coupling region commonly\nshow the pseudogap in the single-particle and magnetic excitations both in the high- and low-density\nregion.\nWe, however, believe that the BCS-BEC cross-over is not an essential viewpoint for the high-Tc cuprates\n[ 368]. This point of view is especially important in order to clarify the origin of the pseudogap. In Sec. 4.2,\nwe show that the excitation gap is induced by the SC fluctuation even far from the cross-over region,\nif we adopt an appropriate model [ 368]. Then, the anomalous behaviors of the self-energy correction,\nwhich is derived by the T-matrix approach, play an essential role. This scenario is rather conventional\nin the fluctuation theory [ 322, 323, 324, 325], but several conditions are required in the SC fluctuation\ntheory.\nThe self-energy correction arising from the SC fluctuation has been investigated in 1970's [ 322, 369],\nwhich shows the decrease of the electronic DOS due to the SC fluctuation. However, it seems that this idea\nhas not attracted much interests, because this is a very weak effect in the conventional superconductor. We\nwould like to stress that this common knowledge should be altered for cuprates, where the SC fluctuation\nis remarkably enhanced by the short coherence length and the quasi-two-dimensionality. Then, the more\npronounced phenomenon is derived; the pseudogap appears in the single-particle spectral function. The\nhigh-Tc cuprates are probably the first example for the clear appearance of this phenomenon.\nIt should be noticed that the T-matrix approach is commonly used for the NSR theory and for the\nestimation of the self-energy. Actually, if we regard the Fig. 40 as a Luttinger's functional Eq. (5), the\nself-energy should be estimated by the SCT approximation. Two aspects of the T-matrix approach, the\nBCS-BEC cross-over and the pseudogap, appear depending on the selected microscopic model. Indeed,\nthe essential differences arise from the electron density and the dimensionality. If we use the 3D jellium\nmodel, the pseudogap appears from the cross-over region [ 348, 357]. Then, the leading scattering process\nis called \"resonance scattering\" since the SC fluctuation has a resonance nature in this region. On the\nother hand, if we use the quasi-2D square lattice model near the half-filling (the nearly half-filled system\nshould be regarded as high density), the self-energy correction gives rise to the pseudogap under more\nmoderate condition.\nThis is mainly because the quasi-two-dimensionality leads to the strong fluctuation and induces the\npseudogap for the relatively small value of TcMF /EF . Moreover, the high electron density makes the\nBCS-BEC cross-over difficult. If we consider the repulsive Hubbard model as in Sec. 4.3, the BCS-BEC\ncross-over is practically impossible. These differences are schematically shown in Fig. 41. We see from\nthis observation that the 3D jellium model is too simplified to discuss the high-Tc cuprates, while several\naspects are common. In two dimensions, the resonance nature of the SC fluctuation is not necessary\nfor the pseudogap, while the renormalization effect induces more propagating character [ 368]. In the\nfollowing part, however, we will commonly use the term \"resonance scattering\" keeping in mind that a\nkind of the resonance between quasi-particle state and Cooper-pairing state is expected.\nAlong this line, the T-matrix approach has been applied to the two-dimensional lattice model including\nthe d-wave symmetry [ 368, 370, 371, 372, 373, 374]. Engelbrecht et al. have applied the SCT approximation to the quarter-filled model [ 370] and the present authors have performed both non-self-consistent\nand self-consistent T-matrix approximations for the nearly half-filled case using the TDGL expansion [\n368, 371]. Subsequently, the microscopic theory starting from the repulsive Hubbard model has been\ndeveloped [ 11] (Sec. 4.3). Then, the pseudogap phenomena are systematically explained including their\ndoping dependence. It should be stressed that this microscopic theory is a natural extension of the theories discussed in Sec. 3.2. Thus, we obtain a comprehensive understanding on the pairing mechanism\nand the normal state properties in Sec. 4.3.\nThe T-matrix approximation is the lowest-order theory with respect to the SC fluctuation. Then, the\npseudogap appears under the reasonable condition, namely intermediate coupling region with a sufficient\nFermi degeneracy. Indeed, the chemical potential is almost not affected by the fluctuation. Basically,\nthe pairing symmetry is not important; the s-wave model shows the pseudogap in a similar way [ 374]\n\n\f51\n\nFigure 41. The schematic figure for the relation between the NSR theory and the pseudogap phenomena.\n(a) The three-dimensional jellium model and (b) two-dimensional square lattice model around the halffilling. The horizontal axis corresponds to the control parameter TcMF /EF for the fixed electron number.\nIt should be noticed that the Fermi energy EF is renormalized in the SCES.\n\nexcept for the difference in the momentum dependence. The SCT approximation is one of the methods to\ninclude the higher-order correction, which is taken into account within the renormalization of the Green\nfunction. Then, the pseudogap in the single-particle spectrum is suppressed, while that of the DOS clearly\nremains. We will give a critical comment on the relevance of the partial summation performed in the SCT\napproximation (Sec. 4.2.5). The two-particle self-consistent (TPSC) approximation has been proposed\nfor an improvement of the T-matrix approximation [ 375, 376], where the coupling constants are adjusted\nto satisfy a sum-rule while the renormalization for the single-particle Green function is neglected.\nA similar, but another approach is the \"phase fluctuation theory\" [ 115, 377, 378, 379, 380, 381]. In\nthis approach, the amplitude of the SC order parameter is fixed and only the phase variable is taken\ninto account. This approach has been indicated [ 115] by the small London constant \u039b in the underdoped region [ 112, 113], which is usually attributed to the small superfluid density ns . In the case of\nthe Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition [ 382], which is the sole phase transition in the two-dimensional\nsystem, the transition temperature TKT is proportional to the London constant. If we consider the actual\nthree-dimensional critical temperature is close to TKT , the \u03b4-dependence of Tc is qualitatively consistent\naccording to the Uemura plot \u039b \u221d \u03b4. The pseudogap state is described as the phase disordered state\nwhich is expected above TKT . The gap structure in the electronic spectrum is generally smeared by the\nphase fluctuation in the SC state [ 383]. It has been, however, shown that the gap structure remains in\nthe phase disordered state [ 377, 378, 379, 380].\nWe consider that the validity of the phase only theory on the electronic structure is not clear up to now.\nIt is surely justified deeply below Tc where the phase fluctuation is dominant but affects perturbatively,\nalthough the coupling to the density fluctuation should be considered there [ 384]. The description of the\nnormal state may require further discussions; the amplitude fluctuation certainly affects there.\nHere we stress that the phase fluctuation theory is not intrinsically incompatible with the T-matrix\napproach. We consider that the former is an approach from the low-temperature side and the latter is\nthat from the high-temperature side, which will be complementary. Because the T-matrix approach is\na perturbation theory with respect to the SC fluctuation, the precise description in the deeply critical\nregion is difficult [ 385]. The two dimension is clearly below the upper critical dimension. The phase only\ntheory should be regarded as a phenomenological description for it, while the (renormalized) Gaussian\nfluctuation region cannot be described.\nAn almost exact treatment is allowed for the one-dimensional model in which the fermions couple to\nthe classical field (Lee-Rice-Anderson model) [ 323]. The classical field describes the fluctuating order\nparameter for which the static approximation is done. The statistical ensemble of the classical field is\nan essential assumption in this model; the Gaussian fluctuation model has been investigated, intensively.\nWhile the Peierls transition has been focused in early years, the AF spin fluctuation and SC fluctuation\nhave been studied, motivated by the high-Tc cuprates. The pseudogap is commonly induced by the\nstrong fluctuation which is characteristic in the one-dimensional system. In 70's, Sadovskii has given an\n\"exact\" solution where the fermion self-energy is represented by the recursive continued fraction [ 325].\nThis method has been applied to the AF spin fluctuation with focus on the high-Tc cuprates [ 386]. The\n\n\f52\nextension to the two-dimensional case is difficult, but it has been performed by Schmalian et al. [ 387] by\nusing the separable form of the spin susceptibility. However, Tchernyshyov has pointed out the technical\nerror of the Sadovskii's solution, which is actually an approximation [ 388]. A sophisticated numerical\nmethod has shown that the Sadovskii's solution is qualitatively a good approximation for the complex\norder parameter [ 389, 390]; the commensurate CDW is not the case, but the SC is the case. Then, the\naccuracy of the approximations usable in higher dimensions has been investigated [ 389]. It is shown that\nthe SCT approximation properly reproduces the low-energy DOS, while the high-energy behavior \u03c9 \u223c \u2206\nis not.\nSince the Gaussian fluctuation is inappropriate near the critical point, a more sophisticated treatment\nfor the statistical ensemble is required for the critical behaviors. The cross-over from the Gaussian\nfluctuation region to the phase fluctuation region has been described on the basis of the Lee-Rice-Anderson\nmodel with a careful treatment of the statistical ensemble [ 391]. Then, the excitation gap appears more\nclearly in the phase fluctuation region, while the \u03c9 2 -behavior appears in the Gaussian-fluctuation model\nwith complex order parameter.\nAnother solvable model is the BCS pairing model with sufficiently long-range attractive interaction.\nThis model is almost exactly solvable in any dimension with the use of the Sadovskii's method [ 392].\nThen, the calculation is technically reduced to the zero-dimensional problem and quantum fluctuation\nplays a dominant role for the low-energy spectrum. Note that the correction pointed out by Tchernyshyov\n[ 388] does not exist in this model. The result shows that the non-self-consistent T-matrix approximation\nappropriately reproduces the asymptotic behavior of the self-energy, while the SCT approximation does\nnot. This model is a clear example in which the partial summation of the higher-order terms is dangerous.\nAlthough these simplified models cannot describe the phase space restriction which is characteristic in\nhigher dimensions, the importance of the vertex correction will be common to the two-dimensional cases,\nat least quantitatively. It is expected that the exact solution will lie between the non-self-consistent and\nself-consistent T-matrix approximations which are used in the next section. The higher-order correction\nin the two-dimensional case will be discussed in the last subsection in Sec. 4.2.\n4.2. General Theory\nIn this section, we clarify the basic mechanism of the pseudogap phenomena with the use of the\nattractive model. It is explained how the pseudogap appears from the SC fluctuation. The microscopic\ntheory starting from the repulsive Hubbard model, as will be given in Sec. 4.3, basically justifies this\nmechanism.\nIn Sec. 4.2.1, the drastic effect of the SC fluctuation on the single-particle properties is demonstrated. The basic idea of the \"resonance scattering\" is introduced. The importance of the quasi-twodimensionality is discussed in Sec. 4.2.2. In Sec. 4.2.3, the pseudogap phenomena under the magnetic field\nare investigated. The coherent understanding on the doping dependence can be examined by the effects\nof the magnetic field. The obtained results are qualitatively consistent with the high field NMR measurements including their doping dependence. From these results, \u03ba-(ET)2 X compounds are suggested to be\nanother candidate for an appearance of the pseudogap. Section 4.2.4 is devoted to the discussion on the\n\u03ba-(ET)2 X compounds. Basically, the theoretical analysis is performed with the use of the T-matrix or\nself-consistent T-matrix approximation. The higher-order correction beyond the T-matrix approximation\nis discussed in Section 4.2.5. It is shown that the vertex correction enhances the pseudogap furthermore.\n4.2.1. Basic mechanism of the pseudogap\nAs is explained in Sec. 2.1, several experimental results have indicated the close relation between the\nSC gap and pseudogap. Among them, rich information obtained from ARPES has led us to the pairing\nscenario. ARPES clearly shows the pseudogap in the single-particle spectrum. In the theoretical point\nof view, the single-particle quantities are simple compared with the two-particle quantities such as the\nmagnetic and transport properties. Therefore, the study on the single-particle properties will capture the\nbasic mechanism of the pseudogap most clearly. We focus on the estimation of the single-particle Green\nfunction in this section. It is simply expected that the pseudogap in the two-particle spectrum is derived\nfrom the pseudogap in the single-particle spectrum.\nIt is instructive to adopt the attractive model in order to investigate the fundamental roles of the SC\n\n\f53\n\nFigure 42.

(43) for t\u2032 /t = 0.25 and \u03b4 = 0.10.\nThe above Hamiltonian is an effective model in which the paring interaction affects the renormalized\nquasi-particles. Since the energy scale is renormalized, the magnitude of the gap and Tc are relatively\nlarger than those in the original model. It should be noted again that the renormalized Fermi energy is\nused in the control parameter for the SC fluctuation, TcMF /EF . This attractive model is a very simplified\none, but we expect that the fundamental features of the SC fluctuation and its effects are included.\nThe SC fluctuation is diagrammatically described by the T-matrix (Fig. 42(a)) which is a propagator of\nthe SC fluctuation. The scattering vertex arising from the T-matrix is factorized into \u03c6k\u2212q/2 t(q)\u03c6k\u2032 \u2212q/2 ,\nwhere\nt(q, i\u03a9n ) = [g \u22121 + \u03c7p0 (q, i\u03a9n )]\u22121 ,\n\n(63)\n\nand\n\u03c7p0 (q, i\u03a9n ) = T\n\nX\nk\n\nG(q/2 + k, i\u03c9m )G(q/2 \u2212 k, i\u03a9n \u2212 i\u03c9m )\u03c62k .\n\n(64)\n\nThe SC phase transition is determined by the divergence of the SC susceptibility t(0, 0), namely 1 +\ng\u03c7p0 (0, 0) = 0. This is called \"Thouless criterion\", which is equivalent to the BCS theory in the weak\ncoupling limit.\nFrom early years, the effects of the SC fluctuation on the two-particle correlation functions have been\ninvestigated intensively [ 369, 393, 394], which are observable in the conventional superconductors. On\nthe other hand, effects on the single-particle properties have not attracted interests except for the early investigation [ 322], probably because this effect is very weak in the conventional (low-Tc and 3D) superconductors. However, the SC fluctuation seriously affects the electronic state in the high-Tc superconductors\nin the following way.\nThe anomalous contribution from the SC fluctuation generally originates from the enhanced T-matrix\naround q = \u03a9 = 0. Therefore, we tentatively expand the reciprocal of the T-matrix as\nt(q, \u03a9) =\n\nt0 +\n\nbq 2\n\ng\n.\n\u2212 (a1 + ia2 )\u03a9\n\n(65)\n\nThis procedure corresponds to the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) expansion. The TDGL\n\n\f54\nparameters are expressed for the Gaussian fluctuation as\nZ\n\u03b5\ntanh( 2T\n)\nT \u2212 Tc\nt0 = 1 + g d\u03b5\n,\n(66)\n\u03c1d (\u03b5) \u223c\n= |g|\u03c1d (0)\n2\u03b5\nTc\nZ\n7\u03b6(3) 2\n\u03c1d (\u03b5)vF2 \u2202 2 f (\u03b5) \u223c\nv ,\n(67)\nb = |g| d\u03b5\n= |g|\u03c1d (0)\n2\n16\u03b5\n\u2202\u03b5\n32(\u03c0T )2 F\nZ\n\u03b5\n)\ntanh( 2T\n1\n1 \u2202\u03c7p0 (0, 0)\n\u03c1d (\u03b5) \u223c\n,\n(68)\na1 = |g| d\u03b5\n= \u03c1\u2032d (0)/\u03c1d (0) \u223c\n= |g|\n2\n(2\u03b5)\n2\n2\n\u2202\u03bc\n\u03c0\na2 = |g|\u03c1d (0) ,\n(69)\n8T\nwhere \u03b6(3) is the Riemann's zeta function and vF is the averaged quasi-particle velocity on the Fermi\nsurface. Here the SC fluctuation is mainly determined by the electronic state around (\u03c0, 0), owing to\nthe d-wave symmetry. Then, vF can be regarded as the velocity at the hot spot (see Fig. 65). The flat\ndispersion observed around (\u03c0, 0) means that the effective Fermi energy EF = vF kF is small. We have\ndefined the effective DOS as\nX\n\u03c1d (\u03b5) =\nA(k, \u03b5)\u03c62k ,\n(70)\nk\n\n\u03c1\u2032d (0)\n\nand\nis its derivative at \u03b5 = 0. We have denoted the spectral function as A(k, \u03c9) = \u2212(1/\u03c0)ImGR (k, \u03c9).\nThe mass term t0 = 1 + g\u03c70 (0, 0) represents the closeness to the critical point. The fluctuation effect\ngradually emerges as t0 is reduced. The parameter b is generally related to the coherence length \u03be0\nas b \u221d \u03be02 \u221d vF2 /T 2 , and therefore sufficiently large in the weak-coupling superconductor. This is the\nreason why the fluctuation is negligible in conventional superconductors. We have defined the parameter\nTcMF /EF \u223c TcMF/vF kF as \"superconducting coupling\" which is an index of the fluctuation effect. In case\nof high-Tc cuprates, TcMF is large and vF is renormalized, and therefore the coherence length is remarkably\nsmall \u03be0 = 3 \u223c 5. This is an essential background of the pseudogap phenomena.\nThe parameter a2 represents the dissipation and expresses the time scale of the fluctuation. This\nparameter is also small in the strong coupling region owing to the high Tc and the renormalization effect\nby the pseudogap [ 368, 395]. The real part a1 is usually ignored because this term is in the higher order\nthan the imaginary part a2 with respect to the small parameter TcMF /EF in the weak-coupling region.\nIn the strong-coupling limit, the absolute value |a1 | can exceed a2 and then, the SC fluctuation has a\n\"resonance nature\" [ 348]. While this situation is somewhat extreme, there is no justification to ignore\na1 in the intermediate coupling region. The sign of the parameter a1 is related to the Hall conductivity\nclose to Tc [ 396]. The anomalous sign of the Hall conductivity in high-Tc cuprates has stimulated much\ninterests [ 397] and remains as an open problem.\nThe anomalous properties in the single-particle spectrum [ 103, 104, 105] are described by the selfenergy correction. Here, we estimate it within the one-loop order (Fig. 42(b)) as\nX\n\u03a3 (k, i\u03c9n ) = T\n(71)\nt(q, i\u03a9m )G(q \u2212 k, i\u03a9m \u2212 i\u03c9n )\u03c62k\u2212q/2 .\nq ,i\u03a9m\nThis procedure corresponds to the T-matrix approximation. In general, the T-matrix around q = 0 gives\nrise to the anomalous properties and that far from q = 0 gives rise to the Fermi-liquid properties. The\nformer process is very small in the weak-coupling case since b \u226b 1. Then, the self-energy shows the\nFermi-liquid behaviors except for just the vicinity to the critical point. On the other hand, the former\novercomes the latter in the intermediate- or strong-coupling region, and then pseudogap appears. This\ncriterion for the pseudogap is moderate in the quasi-two-dimensional system like high-Tc cuprates.\nWe evaluate the anomalous contribution to the imaginary part by using the TDGL parameters [ 368],\n\u22121\n\u03beGL\nT \u03beGL\n\u22122\n4\u03c0bvk \u03b12 /vk2 + \u03beGL\n1\nT\nq\n= \u2212|g|\u03c62k\n4bvk \u03b12 /v 2 + \u03be \u22122\n\nIm\u03a3 R (k, \u03c9) = \u2212|g|\u03c62k\n\nk\n\n= \u2212|g|\u03c62k\n\n(for 1D),\n\n(72)\n\n(for 2D),\n\n(73)\n\n(for 3D),\n\n(74)\n\nGL\n\nq2\nTd\n\u22122\nlog[ 2 c 2 + \u03beGL\n]\n8\u03c0bvk\n\u03b1 /vk\n\n\f55\n\nFigure 43.

However, the qualitative behaviors are correctly grasped by Eqs. (75)\nand (76).\nWe show the typical behaviors in Fig. 43. It should be noticed that the real part of the self-energy\nshows the positive slope around \u03c9 = 0, and there, the imaginary part shows the sharp peak in its absolute\nvalue. Both features are very anomalous compared with the conventional Fermi-liquid theory. This is\ncaused by the \"resonance scattering\" from the SC fluctuation, which is identified to be the origin of\nthe pseudogap phenomena. Owing to the anomalous properties of the self-energy, the spectral function\nclearly shows the pseudogap (Fig. 43(c)).\nLet us provide a more simple explanation on these anomalous features. If we disregard the detailed\nstructure around \u03c9 = 0, the self-energy is simply approximated as\n\u22062 \u03c62k\n,\n\u03c9 + \u03b5(k) + i\u03b4\nX\n\u22062 = \u2212\nt(q, i\u03a9n ).\n\n\u03a3 R (k, \u03c9) =\n\n(78)\n(79)\n\nq\n\nThis approximation is obtained by ignoring the q-dependence of the Green function and that of the form\nfactor in Eq. (71). This form of the self-energy is assumed in the pairing approximation [ 353, 354]. Also,\nthe ARPES experiments have been analyzed by assuming the similar form of the self-energy [ 398].\nIf the self-energy is expressed as Eq. (78), the Green function has the same momentum and frequency\ndependence as the normal Green function in the SC state as\nGR (k, \u03c9) =\n\n\u03c9 + \u03b5(k)\n.\n(\u03c9 + \u03b5(k))(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b5(k)) \u2212 \u22062 \u03c62k\n\n(80)\n\n\f56\n\nFigure 44.

The temperature is\nchosen as T = 1.2Tc in all figures.\n\nFigure 45. The static part of the T-matrix |t(q, 0)| at T = 1.2Tc . (a) g/t = \u22120.5. (b) g/t = \u22121.5.\n\nThen, the energy gap appears in the single-particle spectrum, where the quasi-particle energy is obtained\nas\nq\n(81)\nEk = \u00b1 \u03b5(k)2 + \u22062 \u03c62k .\n\nThe amplitude of the gap is determined by the total weight of the (thermal) SC fluctuation, while the\ngap is related to the order parameter in the mean-field theory.\nThe above expression Eq. (78) is somewhat extreme and inaccurate around \u03c9 = 0 (see Eqs. (73)\nand (76)). We calculate Eqs. (63), (64), and (71) without using the TDGL expansion and show the\nself-energy, spectral function, and DOS in Fig. 44. Here \u03c6k-q/2 is replaced with (\u03c6q-k + \u03c6k )/2 in order\nto restore the periodicity, but the results are not affected by this procedure. We see that the Fermiliquid behaviors appear in the weak-coupling region (|g|/t = 0.5) and the anomalous behavior emerges\nin the intermediate-coupling region (|g|/t = 1 \u223c 2). In the latter case, the pseudogap appears both in\nthe spectral function (Fig. 44(c)) and in the DOS (Fig. 44(d)). The inset of Fig. 44(c) shows that the\nmagnitude of the pseudogap is approximately scaled by the mean-field transition temperature TcMF . The\npseudogap in the two-particle excitations including the NMR 1/T1 T is derived from the pseudogap in the\nsingle-particle excitations (see Secs. 4.2.3 and 4.3.3). It should be noted that the shift of the chemical\npotential is negligible in this region. Thus, the scenario based on the NSR theory is irrelevant in the\ntwo-dimensional high-density system.\nAs is mentioned above, the drastic change from the weak- to the strong-coupling region mainly arises\nthrough the parameter b. It is clearly understood from Fig. 45 that the total weight of the SC fluctuation\nis very small in the weak-coupling region, owing to the large value of b. In this case, the anomalous\ncontribution from SC fluctuation is smeared by the Fermi-liquid contribution. This is why the pseudogap\ndoes not appear in the weak-coupling superconductor.\nThe momentum dependence of the spectral function is shown in Fig. 46. The anomalous contribution to\nthe self-energy is smeared around the gap node. Therefore, the \"Fermi arc\" appears around the diagonal\n\n\f57\n\nFigure 46.

Here, g/t = \u22121.5 and\nthe momentum is A in the inset of Fig. 46.\n\ndirection and disappears as approaching to the critical point. These features are observed behaviors in\nthe ARPES measurements [ 105].\nFigure 47 shows the temperature dependence. It is shown that the pseudogap is smeared as the\ntemperature increases. The pseudogap disappears around T \u2217 which is estimated as T \u2217 \u223c 2TcMF at\ng/t = \u22121.5. It should be stressed that the pseudogap is closed by the broadening, but not by the\ndisappearance of the gap amplitude. This feature is in contrast to Eq. (78) which is revealed to be a\nvery rough estimate. This nature of the pseudogap closing is also consistent with the experiments [\n103, 104, 105, 107, 108].\nThe transition temperature suppressed by the fluctuation has been calculated by the SCT approximation [ 368], where the T-matrix, self-energy, and Green function are determined self-consistently. Here,\nTc is determined by the condition t0 = 0.02 by taking account of the weak three-dimensionality. If we\nchoose a strictly two-dimensional model, Tc is always zero. We see from Fig. 48 that Tc is remarkably\nsuppressed as the superconducting coupling increases, while the suppression rapidly disappears in the\nweak-coupling region. Thus, the wide critical region is expected in the strong-coupling superconductor.\nSince the under-doped cuprates correspond to the case, the pseudogap is widely observed.\nThe pseudogap is basically obtained also in the SCT approximation. For example, the DOS is shown in\nFig. 49. Exceptionally the single-particle spectral function shows no (or very weak) gap structure. On this\npoint, the quantum Monte Carlo simulation for the attractive Hubbard model gives more similar results\nto those of the non-self-consistent T-matrix approximation, where the pseudogap is clearly observed\nin the spectral function. It seems that the estimation of the spectral function is not improved by the\nhigher-order corrections within the SCT. We will discuss this point in Sec. 4.2.5.\nThe extension of the SCT approximation to the superconducting state [ 383, 399] has shown that the\nSC fluctuation is rapidly suppressed in the ordered state while the phase-mode remains gapless. Then,\nthe order parameter grows more rapidly than the BCS theory. This property is a general consequence\nof the critical fluctuation. The rapid growth of the order parameter is commonly obtained in the FLEX\napproximation [ 186, 187, 193] in which the feedback effect is its origin. These two effects additively\n\n\f58\n\nFigure 48. The phase diagram of the attractive model. The transition temperatures in the mean field\ntheory and that in the SCT approximation are shown.\n\nFigure 49. DOS in the SCT approximation.\n\ncontribute in high-Tc cuprates. It should be noticed that we cannot directly measure the order parameter\nin high-Tc cuprates because the pseudogap already exists in the spectrum. Instead, the London constant\n\u039b, which is proportional to the inverse square of the magnetic field penetration depth \u03bbL (\u039b = 1/4\u03c0\u03bb2L ),\nis a better probe of this property [ 383]. This quantity reflects the long-range coherence of the order\nparameter and rapidly develops just below Tc with the increase of the order parameter. Experimental\nresults have confirmed the rapid growth, which precisely corresponds to the universality class of the 3D\nXY model [ 116, 121].\n4.2.2. Effect of three-dimensionality\nSo far, we have stressed that the strong SC fluctuation givesPrise to pseudogap phenomena. In that\ncase, it is necessary that the total weight of the SC fluctuation q |t(q, i\u03a9n )| is large compared with the\nconventional superconductor. The previous discussion in Sec. 4.2.1 has pointed out two conditions for the\npseudogap phenomena. One is the strong-coupling superconductivity, namely the short coherence length.\nAnother is the quasi-two-dimensionality. The former point has been clarified in the previous subsection.\nIn this subsection, we discuss the latter point in more detail.\nFirst, we show the expression for the imaginary part of the self-energy in case of the layered superconductor,\nq\n\u22122\n\u03b3q\n+\n\u03b3 2 qc2 + \u03beGL\n+ \u03b12 /vk2\nc\nTd\nq\n],\n(82)\nlog[\nIm\u03a3 R (k, \u03c9) = \u2212|g|\u03c62k\n8\u03c0vk b\u03b3\n\u2212\u03b3q + \u03b3 2 q 2 + \u03be \u22122 + \u03b12 /v 2\nc\n\nc\n\nGL\n\nk\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the anisotropy of the coherence length \u03b3 = \u03bec0 /\u03be0 and qc = \u03c0/d is the cut-off momentum along\nthe c-axis. d is the inter-layer spacing. We can easily confirm that Eq. (82) is reduced to Eq. (73) and\nEq. (74) in the limit \u03b3 \u2192 0 and \u03b3 \u2192 1, respectively. It is\u221aclearly shown that the quasi-particle damping\n\u2212Im\u03a3 R (k, 0) shows power-law anomaly in 2D case (\u221d 1/ t0 ), but only weak logarithmic anomaly in 3D\ncase (\u221d \u2212 log t0 ). This is evidently due to the restriction of the phase space by the dimensionality. Thus,\nthe quasi-two-dimensionality generally enhances the anomaly. It is necessary for the two-dimensional\n\n\f59\n\nFigure 50. The self-energy obtained by the T-matrix approximation for tz /t = 0.1 (TcMF /t = 0.337) and\ntz /t = 1 (TcMF /t = 0.195) [ 400]. (a) real part and (b) imaginary part at g/t = \u22122. The decrease of mean\nfield TcMF by the three-dimensionality is not essential for the results.\n\nbehaviors that the c-axis coherence length is smaller than the inter-layer spacing \u03bec0 \u2264 d, which is well\nsatisfied in high-Tc cuprates. Then, the critical behavior shows the dimensional cross-over at\nc\n\u03beGL\n= \u03b3\u03beGL \u223c d/2,\n\n(83)\n\nc\nwhere \u03beGL\nis the GL correlation length along the c-axis. Note that the critical behaviors are always\nthree-dimensional near the critical point. Even in the three-dimensional region, the anisotropy enhances\nthe self-energy through the factor \u03b3 \u22121 . We note that the dimensional cross-over occurs for the variation\nof the frequency \u03c9; two-dimensional behavior is more robust at finite frequency.\nWe have actually taken into account the weak three-dimensionality and numerically estimated the\nsingle-particle properties like Sec. 4.2.1 [ 400]. The anisotropy is represented by the parameter tz /t,\nwhere tz is the hopping matrix along the c-axis. We show the results of the T-matrix approximation for\nthe different value of tz /t. The self-energy is shown in Fig. 50. We see that the anomalous behaviors\nwhich are shown in Fig. 44 appear in the quasi-two-dimensional case, tz /t = 0.1. Thus, the pseudogap\nis robust for the weak three-dimensionality. This robustness also results from the strong coupling nature\nof the superconductivity, as is explained later. On the contrary, typical Fermi-liquid behaviors appear\nin the isotropic three-dimensional case, tz /t = 1. In this case, the contribution from the SC fluctuation\nshows only a weak anomaly (Eq. (74)), which is almost smeared by the Fermi-liquid contribution. To\nmake sure, the pseudogap phenomena are possible even in the three-dimensional system [ 401]. However,\nsomewhat hard condition, such as very large coupling constant or just vicinity to the critical point, is\nneeded. Recent calculation for the three-dimensional jellium model has concluded that the pseudogap\nappears in the vicinity of the BCS-BEC cross-over region [ 357]. It is concluded that the appearance of\nthe pseudogap is quantitatively difficult for the three-dimensional systems like heavy-fermion compounds.\nFurthermore we comment on the dimensional cross-over in the quasi-two-dimensional systems. The\ntwo-dimensional behaviors generally appear in the high-temperature region and three-dimensional ones\nare expected below the cross-over temperature. The condition for the dimensional cross-over has been\ngiven in Eq. (83). Then, the cross-over temperature (Tcr ) is estimated as\n\n(Tcr \u2212 Tc )/Tc \u223c 4(\u03bec0 /d)2 \u223c 4\u03be02 (tz /t)2 ,\n\n(84)\n\nsince \u03b3/d \u223c tz /t. If we choose tz /t = 0.05 and \u03be0 = 4, the above expression results in (Tcr \u2212Tc )/Tc \u223c 0.04.\nThus, two-dimensional behaviors are widely expected in high-Tc cuprates. This is also owing to the short\ncoherence length. The strong coupling nature of the superconductivity plays an essential role also in this\nstage.\nFrom the results in Secs. 4.2.1 and 4.2.2, the doping dependence is understood in the following way:\nAccording to the tunnelling experiment [ 89, 110], the gap amplitude at T \u226a Tc increases as \u03b4 decreases.\nThis result indicates that TcMF increases with decreasing \u03b4. Combined with the renormalization of the\nquasi-particle velocity, which is clearly shown by ARPES [ 45, 106], the superconducting coupling increases\nwith under-doping. Then, two-dimensionality simultaneously becomes enhanced [ 26]. As a result, the\nclear pseudogap is expected in the under-doped region, while the pseudogap gradually disappears with\ndoping. Since the pseudogap onset temperature is scaled by TcMF in the intermediate-coupling region,\n\n\f60\nT \u2217 increases with decreasing \u03b4. These features are quite consistent with the phase diagram in high-Tc\ncuprates. The microscopic knowledge is necessary for Tc , which is scaled by the renormalized Fermi\nenergy. We will show the results of the microscopic calculation in Sec. 4.3, where the appropriate doping\ndependence is reproduced.\n4.2.3. Effect of the magnetic field\nIt is generally expected that superconducting phenomena show characteristic behaviors under the\nmagnetic field. The quantum phase of the order parameter is modulated by the magnetic field, and then\nthe characteristic value of the magnetic field is very small in the conventional superconductors. Such\na remarkable response is contrastive to the magnetic properties where the magnetic field dependence is\nusually small, because the Zeeman term (\u223c 10K) is much smaller than the exchange coupling J(\u223c 1000K).\nTherefore, the behaviors under the magnetic field are one of the important tests for the theoretical\nscenarios based on the SC fluctuation. Actually, the magnetic field dependence of the pseudogap has\nbeen investigated by recent experiments. Among them, we discuss here the NMR 1/T1T which has been\nmeasured for high-Tc superconductors [ 402, 403, 404, 405] and organic superconductors [ 137]. Important\nknowledge has been obtained for both systems.\nIn this subsection, we focus on the high-Tc cuprates. The experimental results are summarized as\nfollows. The magnetic field dependence is little observed in the under-doped region [ 402, 403]. In\nparticular, the onset temperature T \u2217 does not depend on the magnetic field up to 20 Tesla. The effect of\nthe magnetic field is observed only close to T = Tc . It is also observed that the transition temperature\nis suppressed by the magnetic field. On the contrary, the effects of the magnetic field are clearly visible\naround the optimally-doped region in which only the weak pseudogap phenomenon is observed in the\nnarrow temperature region [ 404, 405].\nThe theoretical results for the magnetic field dependence are obtained in the following way [ 371].\nAlthough the following explanation basically considers the Gaussian fluctuation, qualitatively the same\ntendency is expected for the critical fluctuation. We consider the magnetic field applied along the c-axis\n(B k ~c) in accordance with the experimental condition. The main effect of the magnetic field is the\nLandau level quantization of the SC fluctuation, which is quasi-classically expressed by the replacement\nof the quadratic term in the T-matrix as q 2 \u21d2 4eB(n + 1/2) [ 406, 407]. The Landau quantization of the\nquasi-particle is ignored in the usual condition \u03c9c \u03c4 \u226a 1, where \u03c9c is the cyclotron frequency.\nThe Landau quantization has the following two important effects. One is the suppression of superconductivity. The mass term is increased by the zero-point oscillation energy as t0 \u21d2 t0 + 2beB, which\ncorresponds to the lowest Landau level. The SC fluctuation is suppressed by this effect. The other is the\nLandau degeneracy which generally enhances the fluctuation because the effective dimension is reduced.\nThe transition temperature is further reduced by the enhanced fluctuation. Considering at the fixed\ntemperature in accordance with the experiments, the dominant effect is the former. Then, we see that\n\u22122\nthe characteristic magnetic field Bch for the SC fluctuation is expressed as Bch \u223c t0 /b = \u03beGL\n. That is,\n2\nthe effects of the magnetic field are scaled by the magnetic flux penetrating the correlated area \u03beGL\n.\nAs we have stressed above, pseudogap appears in the short coherence length superconductors. Then, a\nlarge value of the characteristic magnetic field is expected. Moreover, the parameter t0 around the onset\ntemperature T \u2217 is not so small in the strong-coupling superconductors. Then, the characteristic magnetic\nfield Bch around T = T \u2217 is in the same order as Hc2 (0) which is over 100Tesla in the under-doped region.\nThis is the simple but robust reason why the magnetic field dependence of the onset temperature T \u2217\nis not observed in the under-doped region. Because the characteristic magnetic field is generally small\nin the conventional superconductors, this magnetic field independence was sometimes interpreted as a\nnegative evidence for the pairing scenario. However, this interpretation is inappropriate.\nThe magnetic field effects are apparent in the temperature region close to Tc , since the GL correlation\nlength \u03beGL diverges at the critical point. This effect is actually observed even in the under-doped region\n[ 402]. These behaviors are confirmed by the numerical calculation based on the T-matrix approximation\n[ 371], where the magnetic field with experimentally relevant order B\u223c10 Tesla is considered. Then,\nthe Kubo formula is used to estimate the correlation function and the effect of the SC fluctuation is\nincluded in the self-energy correction. The vertex correction corresponding to the Maki-term is usually\nnot important for the d-wave superconductor [ 407, 408]. Figure 51 shows the results for g/t = \u22121.6\nwhere the pseudogap is clearly observed (Sec. 4.2.1). We see the magnetic field independence below T \u2217\nand magnetic field dependence around Tc .\n\n\f61\n\nFigure 51. The calculated results for 1/T1 T under the magnetic field. The relatively strong coupling case\ng/t = \u22121.6. The horizontal axis is the temperature scaled by the Tc under the zero magnetic field.\n\nFigure 52. The calculated results for 1/T1 T under the magnetic field. The weak coupling case g/t = \u22121.0.\n\nIt should be noted that the magnetic field dependence of Tc is explained by taking account of the\ncritical fluctuation. The latter effect \"Landau degeneracy\" significantly enhances the fluctuation and\nsuppresses the Tc . Therefore, the magnetic field dependence of Tc is more drastic than that expected\nfrom the mean-field theory. This is a qualitative explanation [ 371, 409] of the different behaviors between\nT \u2217 and Tc [ 402, 403].\nOn the contrary, larger magnetic-field dependence is expected in the relatively weak-coupling case. In\nthis case, the onset temperature T \u2217 may be reduced by the magnetic field. The result of the T-matrix\napproximation for g/t = \u22121.0 shows a clear magnetic field dependence below T \u2217 (Fig. 52). This behavior\ncorresponds to the optimally-doped region. These doping dependences are in good agreement with the\nexperimental results. The detailed estimation on the magnetic field dependence in the optimally-doped\nregion has been performed in Ref. [ 407].\nThe pseudogap phenomena should be comprehensively understood from the under- to optimally-doped\nregion. Based on this belief, we consider that the magnetic field dependence of NMR 1/T1T gives a strong\nsupport for the pairing scenario. The usual behaviors of the SC fluctuation in the optimally-doped region\nand the strong-coupling behaviors in the under-doped region are consistent with the understanding of\nthe phase diagram (Fig. 1 and Sec. 4.2.2).\nHere note that we have ignored the Zeeman coupling term. This procedure is justified because the\nZeeman term gives only a higher-order correction in the fluctuating regime [ 371]. The role of the\nZeeman term can be clarified by changing the direction of the magnetic field because the \"orbital effect\"\nis suppressed when the magnetic field is applied along the plane.\nRecently, the magnetic field dependence of the c-axis conductivity is measured for the Bi-based compounds. Owing to the strong two-dimensionality, it is expected that the incoherent process dominates\nthe c-axis conductivity in these compounds. Then, the c-axis DC conductivity basically measures the\nelectronic DOS at \u03c9 = 0. Therefore, this probe additively detects the large pseudogap below T0 as well\nas the small pseudogap below T \u2217 (Fig. 1). The c-axis resistivity increases below T0 especially in the\nunder-doped region. This upturn of the c-axis resistivity coincides with the decrease of the uniform spin\nsusceptibility [ 410]. Then, the magnetic resistance is negative [ 411] owing to the destruction of the\n\n\f62\npseudogap. Shibauchi et al. have reported the measurements for Bi-2212 compounds up to 60 Tesla [\n412]. The result shows that the Zeeman term suppresses the large pseudogap in the over-doped region\nwhere the typical magnetic field is small. This result may be an evidence for the magnetic origin of the\nlarge pseudogap. Lavrov et al. have reported the measurements for Bi-2201 compounds from over-doped\nto heavily under-doped (insulating) region [ 413]. Then, two distinct responses to the magnetic field are\nobserved in the under-doped (superconducting) region. This result implies two distinct origins of the suppression of the DOS which have been discussed in Sec. 2.1.5. In particular, the anisotropy of the magnet\nresistance will be a clear evidence for the appearance of the SC fluctuation. The sensitivity of the \"orbital\neffect\" to the direction of the magnetic field is clearly observed in the vicinity of Tc , which is consistent\nwith the pseudogap induced by the SC fluctuation. It should be noted again that the orbital effect is not\nclear around T = T \u2217 because the characteristic magnetic field is too large. Therefore, we have a question\nabout the interpretation in Ref. [ 413], which concluded from the weak magnetic field dependence that\nT \u2217 decreases with under-doping. Taking account of the short correlation length \u03beGL at T = T \u2217 , the\nT \u2217 in the under-doped region will be higher than that determined in Ref. [ 413]. The analysis in the\nhigher magnetic field is desirable to estimate T \u2217 more precisely. Another interesting observation in Ref. [\n413] is that the magnetoresistance is positive in the non-superconducting region. This result implies the\nqualitative difference of the electronic state between the insulating and superconducting regions, which\nsupports our theoretical approach to the high-Tc superconductivity from the metallic side.\n\n4.2.4. Another candidate: organic superconductor \u03ba-(ET)2 X\nIn this subsection, we suggest another candidate for the pseudogap state induced by the SC fluctuation.\nThe organic superconductor \u03ba-(ET)2 X is a clear two-dimensional system with Tc \u223c 10K. As is noted\nin Sec. 3.3, this value of Tc is comparable to that of the high-Tc cuprates when normalized by the\nFermi energy. Thus, two important conditions explained in Sec. 4.2.2 can be satisfied in this compound.\nTherefore, we expect a similar appearance of the pseudogap.\nConcerning the pressure dependence, the pseudogap is expected in the lower pressure region because\nthe Tc is large and EF is small. By applying the pressure, the superconductivity gradually becomes the\nweak-coupling one and therefore the pseudogap will disappear. This variation is similar to the doping\n\u25e6\n\ndependence of high-Tc cuprates. The coherence length has been estimated from the Hc2 as \u03be = 28 \u00b1 5(A)\n\u25e6\n\nand \u03be = 53\u00b16(A) for \u03ba-(ET)2 Cu[N(CN)2 ]Br and \u03ba-(ET)2 Cu(NCS)2 , respectively [ 414]. This variation is\nconsistent with the above expectation because \u03ba-(ET)2 Cu[N(CN)2 ]Br corresponds to the lower pressure\nregion (Fig. 8). These values of the coherence length are comparable to the length scale of the structural\nunit. This is just a condition for the pseudogap phenomena.\nThe NMR measurements have actually observed the pseudogap in \u03ba-(ET)2 X with T \u2217 \u223c 50K [ 135, 136].\nHowever, this T \u2217 should not be identified to the onset of the SC fluctuation, because the pressure\ndependence is not consistent. The nature around T \u2217 probably corresponds to the metal-insulator crossover; the electronic state is almost incoherent above T \u2217 . Then, the manifestation of the SC fluctuation\nis expected in the lower temperature region. This expectation is clearly supported by the recent NMR\nmeasurement by the Kanoda's group [ 137]. They have measured the magnetic field dependence of the\nNMR 1/T1 T and shown that the SC fluctuation appears below the new cross-over temperature Tc\u2217 which\nis between Tc and T \u2217 .\nIt is an advantage of the organic materials that the superconductivity is destroyed by the magnetic field\nabout 10 Tesla which is experimentally practical. The experimental result shows that the NMR 1/T1 T\nincreases above Tc and below Tc\u2217 \u223c 20K by applying the magnetic field H > Hc2 along the c-axis. On the\ncontrary, the NMR 1/T1T is not affected by the same magnetic field along the plane. Hc2 is much larger\nthan the applied field in this direction. The anisotropy is a clear evidence for the \"orbital effect\" which is\na characteristics of the SC fluctuation. Therefore, the further decrease of 1/T1 T below Tc\u2217 is attributed\nto the SC fluctuation. These results have revealed the hidden phenomena under the zero magnetic\nfield. This effect has been unclear since it is masked by the sizable decrease from 50 K. The magnetic\nfield dependence has played a key role to identify the contribution from the SC fluctuation. Thus, the\npseudogap induced by the SC fluctuation is a universal phenomenon for the quasi-two-dimensional short\ncoherence length superconductors.\n\n\f63\n\nFigure 53. The loop expansion of the self-energy within the 3-loop order.\n\n4.2.5. higher-order corrections\nSo far, we have discussed the effect of the SC fluctuation within the 1-loop order (T-matrix approximation). At the last of Sec. 4.2, we briefly discuss the effect of the higher-order corrections. The SCT\napproximation, which is an extended version of the T-matrix approximation, shows the pseudogap in\nmany aspects but only a weak one in the single-particle spectral function. This result implies that the\nqualitative role of SC fluctuation is robust but the higher-order corrections quantitatively suppress the\npseudogap. However, because the SCT is a partial summation of the higher-order terms, particular effects tend to be overestimated. Therefore, the effect of the vertex correction is interesting to capture the\nqualitative tendency more precisely.\nIn this subsection, we carry out the loop expansion within the 3-loop order [ 415]. The corresponding\ndiagrams are shown in Fig. 53. The 1-loop term (Fig. 53(a)) is included in the T-matrix approximation. The 2-loop term (Fig. 53(b)) and a part of the 3-loop term (Fig. 53(c,d)) are included in the\nSCT approximation. Importantly, the lowest-order vertex correction term appears in the 3-loop order\n(Fig. 53(e)).\nHere, we ignore the higher-order corrections on the T-matrix. The corrections to the T-matrix are well\nexpressed by the renormalization of the TDGL parameters (Eq. (65)) and qualitatively not important.\nThe renormalization effect further reduces the parameter b from Eq. (67), while Tc is reduced as is shown\nin Fig. 48. It is more important that the pseudogap in the spectral function is smeared in the SCT\napproximation through the terms like Fig. 53(b-d). This kind of the correction is not included in the\ntwo-particle self-consistent (TPSC) approximation [ 375, 376], where the spectral function has a similar\nfeature to the non-self-consistent T-matrix approximation.\nHere we use the static approximation where only the classical part of the T-matrix (t(q, i\u03a9n = 0))\nis taken into account. This approximation is appropriate near the critical point because the singular\ncontributions from the SC fluctuation (Eqs. (72)-(76)) are derived from the classical part. At least, this\napproximation is sufficient to capture the qualitative bahaviors. In the following figure, we show the\nresults in the s-wave case, namely \u03c6k = 1 for simplicity. Almost the same results are expected in the\nd-wave case.\nWe show the imaginary part of the self-energy in Fig. 54(a). It is shown that the 1-loop term has similar\nfeatures to the results of the T-matrix approximation, although the structure around \u03c9 = 0 is broadened.\nThe 2-loop term gives an oppsite contribution to the self-energy. Therefore, the spectral function within\nthe 2-loop order becomes very sharp (see Fig. 54(b)), which indicates a well-defined quasi-particle. To\nthe contrary, the 3-loop terms enhance the 1-loop term, and therefore, pseudogap clearly appears in this\norder. This recurrence occurs in the SCT approximation and finally results in Fig. 49. It is important to\nnote that the lowest-order vertex correction term enhances the pseudogap furthermore. Therefore, it is\nexpected that the smearing of the spectral function and DOS in the SCT approximation is considerably\ncanceled by the vertex correction. In other words, the effects of the SC fluctuation are underestimated\nin the SCT approximation. Roughly speaking, the correct result will lie between the non-self-consistent\nand self-consistent T-matrix approximations. Then, Tc is reduced more remarkably than that in Fig. 48.\nThis conjecture is consistent with the Quantum Monte Carlo simulation in the attractive Hubbard model\n[ 366, 367].\nInterestingly, the three kinds of the 3-loop term has qualitatively same feature. In particular, the\ncomparison between the term in Fig. 53(d) and that in Fig. 53(e) may be interesting because they are\n\n\f64\n\nFigure 54. (a) The imaginary part of the self-energy and (b) the spectral function at k = (\u03c0, 0.13\u03c0).\nHere, g/t = \u22121.4 and T = 0.049 = 1.04Tc . In (a), each contribution from the diagram in Fig. 53(a), (b),\n(d), and (e) is shown, respectively.\n\nequivalent in the Sadovskii's meathod for the one-dimensional model [ 325] and for the BCS pairing\nmodel [ 392]. This equivalency is not satisfied in two dimensions, but Fig. 54(a) shows that it is qualitatively justfied. We can see that the vertex correction term has larger contribution. This tendency is\nremarkable around the \"hot spot\" and insignificant around the \"cold spot\". The difference increases with\nincreasing the superconducting coupling TcMF /EF . It should be noticed that the asymptotic behavior of\nthe specral function in the Sadovskii's meathod [ 392] is more similar to the non-self-consistent T-matrix\napproximation than to the SCT one. From the above observations, we expect that the correct result in\nthe two-dimensional model will behave as in the T-matrix approximation. Then, the pseudogap clearly\nappears in the spectral function (see Sec. 4.2.1).\n4.3. Microscopic Theory: FLEX+T-matrix approximation\nIn the previous section, we have discussed the general aspect of the pseudogap phenomena induced\nby the SC fluctuation. Then, a model with attractive interaction has been used as an effective model.\nOf course, the relevant Hamiltonian for cuprates is the repulsive model, where the pairing interaction\nshould be derived from the many-body effects as performed in Sec. 3. Then, the microscopic theory\nstarting from the repulsive model is highly desired for the pseudogap phenomena. It should be confirmed\nthat the effective coupling of the superconductivity TcMF /EF is strong enough to lead to the pseudogap\nphenomena. The doping dependence will be an interesting consequence of such microscopic theory. We\nwill see that the microscopic treatment is essential for the coherent understanding of the magnetic and\ntransport properties, which have been stimulated much interests. The purpose of this section is a review\nof the microscopic theory based on the FLEX+T-matrix approximation, by which the SC fluctuation is\nmicroscopically taken into account. The Hubbard model (Eqs. (42) and (43)) is chosen as a microscopic\nmodel. We similarly fix the parameter as 2t = 1 and t\u2032 = 0.25t.\nThe FLEX+T-matrix approximation was first proposed in Ref. [ 416] where the NMR 1/T1 T is calculated by using the phenomenological form of the T-matrix. Fully microscopic treatment has been\nproposed in [ 417] and developed in Ref. [ 11]. We explain how the anomalous properties in the normal\nstate are understood from this approach.\n4.3.1. Single-particle properties\nLet us briefly explain the basic formulation of the FLEX+T-matrix approximation. The characteristic behaviors of the single-particle properties are discussed in parallel. We show that the resonance\nscattering gives rise to the pseudogap in the under-doped region. The doping dependence including the\nelectron-doped cuprates is consistently explained in Sec. 4.3.2. The magnetic and transport properties\nare discussed in Secs. 4.3.3 and 4.3.4, respectively.\nFirst we describe the quasi-particles and AF spin fluctuation by using the FLEX approximation. The\ncharacteristic properties of the quasi-particles in the nearly AF Fermi-liquid [ 85, 86] are summarized\nin the following way. Figure 55 shows the typical results of the self-energy. The local minimum of the\nabsolute value of the imaginary part at \u03c9 = 0 assures the Fermi-liquid behaviors. There clearly appear\nnotable features of the nearly AF Fermi-liquid. The first is the \u03c9-linear dependence of the imaginary\npart, which is in contrast to the \u03c9-square dependence in the conventional Fermi-liquid theory. The origin\n\n\f65\n\nFigure 55. (a) The real part and (b) imaginary part of the self-energy in the FLEX approximation. (c)\nThe spectral function. The momentum A, B and C is shown in the inset of (b). Here, U/t = 3.2, \u03b4 = 0.10\nand T = 0.01.\n\nFigure 56. (a) The T-matrix. (b) The self-energy arising from the SC fluctuation, \u03a3S (k).\n\nof the \u03c9-linear dependence is the low-energy spin excitation, which is also the origin of the T -linear law\nof the resistivity [ 85, 86] (see Sec. 4.3.4). The second is the strong momentum dependence of the selfenergy. For example, the damping rate of quasi-particles, 1/\u03c4 (k) = \u2212Im\u03a3FR (k, 0) is large around (\u03c0, 0)\n(\"hot spot\") and is small around (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) (\"cold spot\"). This momentum dependence plays a crucial\nrole in the transport properties, especially in the pseudogap state (Sec. 4.3.4). The renormalization\nfactor zk\u22121 = 1 \u2212 \u2202Re\u03a3R\nF (k, \u03c9)/\u2202\u03c9|\u03c9=0 has the qualitatively same momentum dependence. The quasiparticle velocity is considerably small at the hot spot because of the van Hove singularity and the large\nrenormalization factor. This is just the flat dispersion observed in ARPES [ 45, 106]. We have commented\nin Fig. 25 that the AF spin fluctuation transforms the Fermi surface [ 86]. The Fermi surface is pinned to\nthe flat dispersion owing to the transformation of the Fermi surface. Because the effective Fermi energy\nof the superconductivity is determined by the quasi-particle velocity around the hot spot as EF \u223c vF kF ,\nthe effective coupling of the superconductivity TcMF /EF is enhanced by the flat dispersion. Then, the\ncoherence length \u03be and the TDGL parameter b are much reduced.\nThe spectral function A(k, \u03c9) shows the single peak structure (Fig. 55(c)), which justifies the picture\nof the quasi-particles in the nearly AF Fermi-liquid. The spectral function is remarkably broad at the\nhot spot and sharp at the cold spot reflecting the momentum dependence of the quasi-particle damping.\nThis is also observed in ARPES around the optimally-doping [ 106]. However, the pseudogap appears\nneither in the spectral function nor in the DOS. Thus, the FLEX approximation is insufficient for the\ndescription of the pseudogap state.\nThe SC fluctuation is derived from the effective pairing interaction described in Eq. (33). We consider\nthe T-matrix which is expressed by the ladder diagrams in the particle-particle channel (Fig. 56(a)). By\n\n\f66\n\nFigure 57.

Here, U/t = 3.2,\n\u03b4 = 0.10 and T = 1.2Tc .\n\nrestricting to the d-wave channel, the T-matrix is estimated by extending the \u00c9liashberg equation [ 11],\ng\u03bb(q)\u03c6(k1 )\u03c6\u2217 (k2 )\n,\nT (k1 , k2 : q) =\n1 \u2212 \u03bb(q)\nX\n\u03bb(q) = \u2212\n\u03c6\u2217 (k)Va (k \u2212 p)G(p)G(q \u2212 p)\u03c6(p).\n\n(85)\n(86)\n\nk,p\n\nHere, the expression of the FLEX approximation is used for the effective interaction Va (k) and the Green\nfunction G(k). \u03c6(k) is the eigenfunction of the \u00c9liashberg equation Eq. (16) with its maximum eigenvalue\n\u03bbe . This function corresponds to the wave function of the fluctuating Cooper-pairs. This procedure is\njustified when the correlation length is long enough, namely in the vicinity of the critical point T = Tc .\nBecause this procedure is based on the \u00c9liashberg equation with fully including the momentum and\nfrequency dependence, the characteristics of the spin-fluctuation-induced superconductivity are included\nin the T-matrix. In Eqs. (85) and (86), the wave function is normalized as\nX\n|\u03c6(k)|2 = 1.\n(87)\nk\n\nThen, the constant factor g is obtained as\nX\n\u03c6\u2217 (k1 )Va (k1 \u2212 k2 )\u03c6(k2 ).\ng=\n\n(88)\n\nk1 ,k2\n\nIt should be noted that the parameter \u03bb(0) is equivalent to the maximum eigenvalue of the \u00c9liashberg\nequation, namely \u03bb(0) = \u03bbe . Then, the divergence of the T-matrix is equivalent to the criterion in the\n\u00c9liashberg equation \u03bbe = 1.\nThe self-energy correction arising from the SC fluctuation is obtained within the 1-loop order (FLEX+Tmatrix approximation),\nX\n\u03a3S (k) =\nT (k, k : q)G(q \u2212 k).\n(89)\nq\n\nThe total self-energy is obtained by adding it to the contribution from the spin fluctuation \u03a3(k) =\n\u03a3F (k) + \u03a3S (k).\nThe self-energy in the under-doped region is shown in Figs. 57(a) and (b). We clearly see the anomalous\nbehaviors which arises from the SC fluctuation. The similar structure to that in the attractive model\n(Fig. 44) appears in the low-frequency region. In particular, the extremely large damping around the\nFermi level gives rise to the clear pseudogap in the spectral function and in the DOS (Figs. 57(c) and\n(d)). This is a result of the \"resonance scattering\". Thus, the superconductivity described by the FLEX\napproximation is strong coupling enough to induce the pseudogap in the under-doped region. It should be\nnoted that the SC fluctuation is still over-damped, while an asymmetric structure appears owing to not so\n\n\f67\n\nFigure 58.

The inset shows the result at the fixed temperature T = 0.0082.\n\nsmall a1 /a2 (see Eq. 65). Because of the momentum dependence of the wave function \u03c6(k), the pseudogap\nhas a d-wave form which is similar to the SC gap. The anomalous behaviors are smeared around the\ncold spot and the \"Fermi arc\" appears in the pseudogap region. This is an important character of the\npseudogap observed by ARPES measurements [ 103, 104, 105].\nIt is an advantage of the microscopic calculation that the reasonable energy scale of the pseudogap\nis obtained, while much larger value is obtained in the attractive model. Here, the gap magnitude \u2206pg\nand Tc are smaller by an order. This is because the superconductivity and the pseudogap take place in\nthe renormalized quasi-particles near the Fermi surface. As a result, the energy scale takes a realistic\nvalue 2\u2206pg \u223c 100meV. We again stress that the effective Fermi energy is renormalized by the electron\ncorrelation and therefore the effective coupling TcMF /EF is enhanced.\nBefore closing this subsection, we discuss the relation to the SC gap. The ratio 2\u2206s /TcMF \u223c 12 has\nbeen obtained by the FLEX approximation in the optimally-doped region [ 186, 187, 193], where \u2206s is\nthe maximum value of the SC gap. A larger value of this ratio is expected in the under-doped region.\nThe experimental results have shown that the energy scale of the pseudogap is slightly larger than the SC\ngap [ 103, 104, 105, 107]. Our result indicates the ratio 2\u2206pg /Tc \u223c 20 in the under-doped region. Thus,\nthe pseudogap obtained in the FLEX+T-matrix approximation has a relevant magnitude compared with\nthe SC gap.\n4.3.2. Doping dependence\nThe FLEX+T-matrix approximation appropriately reproduces the doping dependence. In the previous\nsubsection, a clear pseudogap is shown in the under-doped region. The anomalous properties gradually\ndisappear as the doping concentration is increased. Consequently, the pseudogap in the DOS is filled up\nwith hole-doping (Fig. 58(a)).\nThis closing of the pseudogap is basically understood from the doping dependence of the TDGL parameter b (Fig. 59). The large value of b generally means the weak SC fluctuation, which is realized\nin the over-doped region. Owing to the relation b \u221d (vF\u2217 /T )2 , the parameter b rapidly develops in the\n\n\f68\n\nFigure 60. Temperature dependence of the NMR 1/T1 T and T1 T /(T2G )2 in the FLEX approximation for\nU/t = 3.2.\n\nweak-coupling region. Here vF\u2217 is the quasi-particle velocity around (\u03c0, 0). In our notation, the parameter\nb includes the coupling constant g as b \u221d |g|\u03c1d (0)(vF\u2217 /T )2 . Because the decrease of vF\u2217 /T is considerably\ncanceled by the increase of g, the parameter b saturates in the under-doped region. This feature does not\ncontradict with the development of the SC fluctuation.\nThe similar closing of the pseudogap is caused by decreasing U (Figs. 58(b) and 59(b)). Thus, the\npseudogap phenomena are one of the characteristics of the strongly correlated electron systems, where\nsuperconductivity tends to be strong coupling. The inset of Fig. 59(b) shows the TDGL parameter at the\nfixed temperature. The result clarifies the role of the electron correlation, namely the renormalization of\nthe quasi-particle velocity. We see that the TDGL parameter b and the coherence length is reduced by\nthe electron correlation.\nAt last, we discuss the electron-doped cuprates. Owing to the next-nearest neighbor hopping term t\u2032 ,\nthe electronic DOS is relatively small in the electron-doped region. In particular, the Fermi level is not\npinned to the flat dispersion around (\u03c0, 0). This feature means that the electron correlation is effectively\nweak in the electron-doped cuprates. Therefore, more conventional behaviors are expected in the normal\nstate. The calculated results based on the FLEX approximation confirm this naive expectation. The\nimaginary part of the self-energy shows the \u03c9 2 -dependence, which is a conventional Fermi-liquid behavior.\nThis feature indicates the T 2 -law of the resistivity which is confirmed in Sec. 4.3.4 and experimentally\nobserved in the wide temperature region [ 23].\nConcerning the pseudogap, the SC fluctuation is very weak in the electron-doped region. This is because\nthe quasi-particle velocity vF\u2217 is large around (\u03c0, \u03c0/4), and more importantly, because Tc is low. We have\nalready explained the reason of low Tc in Sec. 3.1.4. Thus, the superconductivity is the weak-coupling\none, which is indicated by the large TDGL parameter b \u223c 30. The comparable value to the over-doped\nregion indicates that the pseudogap is very weak even if it is observed by some experiments. The large\nvalue of the coherence length \u03be is consistent with the small Hc2 = 5 \u223c 10Tesla [ 419]. These results\nare consistent with the recent experiments of the ARPES [ 418], neutron scattering [ 79], NMR 1/T1 T [\n419], and tunnelling spectroscopy [ 420]. These measurements do not show the \"small pseudogap\" in the\nelectron-doped cuprates.\nOther authors have suggested the pseudogap in the electron-doped cuprates Nd2\u2212x Cex CuO4\u2212y from\nthe optical measurements [ 421]. They have shown that the characteristic structure of the frequency\ndependent scattering rate 1/\u03c4 (\u03c9). The suggested pseudogap has much larger magnitude than the SC gap,\nand appears from the very high temperature T > 300K. It is therefore considered that this phenomenon\nis not attributed to the same origin as that of the small pseudogap in the hole-doped cuprates. Because\na similar structure is observed even in the AF state, this phenomenon may be attributed to the \"large\npseudogap\" with magnetic origin. The observation of the ARPES [ 418] indicates the broad suppression\nof the single particle spectrum around the magnetic Brillouin zone. Since this suppression has also large\nenergy scale, the existence of the large pseudogap and importance of the AF spin fluctuation have been\nsuggested.\n\n\f69\n4.3.3. Magnetic properties\nIn the following subsections, we discuss the magnetic and transport properties which are calculated by\nusing the Kubo formula. The estimation of the two-particle correlation functions are required for this\npurpose. First we focus on the magnetic properties, which have been the central issue among the several\npseudogap phenomena.\nMany authors have used the FLEX approximation in order to investigate the magnetic properties in\nhigh-Tc cuprates [ 188]. The vertex correction is needed in the context of the conserving approximation [\n22, 177], but usually it is ignored. The estimation in the early stage [ 188] has indicated that the vertex\ncorrection reduces the spin susceptibility but does not alter the qualitative behaviors. The characteristic\nbehaviors of the nearly AF Fermi-liquid are well reproduced within the FLEX approximation. The NMR\n1/T1T shows the Curie-Weiss law (Fig. 60) and its relation to the NMR 1/T2G shows the magnetic scaling\nwith the dynamical exponent z = 2 (see the inset in Fig. 60). It is microscopically shown that the AF\nspin correlation increases with decreasing \u03b4. These features have been assumed in the phenomenological\ntheory [ 178, 179, 180, 181]. It should be, however, noted that the pseudogap is not derived within the\nFLEX approximation.\nThe pseudogap in the NMR (see Sec. 2.1.3) is explained by taking account of the SC fluctuation, as is\nshown in the following way [ 11]. In the FLEX+T-matrix approximation, the dynamical spin susceptibility\n\u03c7R\ns (q, \u03a9) is obtained by extending the FLEX approximation\n\u03c70 (q)\n,\n1 \u2212 U \u03c70 (q)\nX\n\u03c70 (q) =\nG(k)G(k + q),\n\u03c7s (q) =\n\n(90)\n(91)\n\nk\n\nwhere the effects of the SC fluctuation are included in the self-energy \u03a3S (k). The NMR spin-lattice\nrelaxation rate 1/T1 and spin-echo decay rate 1/T2G are obtained by the following formula [ 27, 422]\n1/T1 T\n\n=\n\n(1/T2G )2\n\n=\n\n1\nF\u22a5 (q)[ Im\u03c7R\ns (q, \u03c9) |\u03c9\u21920 ],\n\u03c9\nq\nX\nX\n2\n2\n[Fk (q)Re\u03c7R\nFk (q)Re\u03c7R\ns (q, 0)] \u2212 [\ns (q, 0)] .\nq\nq\nX\n\n(92)\n(93)\n\nHere F\u22a5 (q) = 21 {A1 + 2B(cos qx + cos qy )}2 + 12 {A2 + 2B(cos qx + cos qy )}2 and Fk (q) = {A2 + 2B(cos qx +\ncos qy )}2 [ 423]. The hyperfine coupling constants A1 , A2 , and B are evaluated as A1 = 0.84B and\nA2 = \u22124B [ 200].\nWe show the calculated results for the NMR 1/T1 T , 1/T2G , and static spin susceptibility in Fig. 61.\nWe see that the pseudogap clearly appears in the NMR 1/T1 T (Fig. 61(a)). The decrease of the NMR\n1/T1T above Tc is the first observation of the pseudogap phenomenon [ 55]. The 1/T1 T is reduced with\napproaching to the critical point because the dissipation of the spin fluctuation is suppressed by the\npseudogap in the DOS.\nThe NMR 1/T2G also shows the pseudogap with the onset temperature T \u2217 close to that in the 1/T1 T\n(Fig. 61(a)). This is also an effect of the SC fluctuation. So far, different behaviors of 1/T2G have\nbeen reported for several high-Tc compounds [ 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 71, 72]. At present, they are\nattributed to the effects of the interlayer coupling [ 63, 71]. The experimental data on the single layer\ncompounds show the decrease of 1/T2G in the pseudogap state [ 62, 63], which is consistent with our\nresult in Fig. 61(a). It is interesting that the pseudogap in the NMR 1/T2G is moderate compared with\nthe NMR 1/T1 T . This is because the NMR 1/T2G measures the static part which reflects the total\nweight of the spin fluctuation. It should be noticed that the pseudogap suppresses only the low-frequency\ncomponent of the spin fluctuation, because the superconductivity has a smaller energy scale than that\nof the spin fluctuation. Thus, it is no wonder that the scaling relation of the spin fluctuation is violated\nin the pseudogap state (see the inset in Fig. 61(a) and experimental result [ 63]). These features are\nqualitatively consistent with the experimental results [ 62, 63, 71, 72]. The obtained behavior of the\n1/T2G is expected from the result in the superconducting state [ 424]. Then, the 1/T2G remains even at\nlow temperature, although the 1/T1 T rapidly decreases. This is a characteristic behavior of the d-wave\nsuperconductivity and has played an important role for identifying the pairing symmetry [ 58]. Because\n\n\f70\n\nFigure 61.

(b) The imaginary part.\n\nthe pseudogap is a precursor of the d-wave superconductivity, the above results in the pseudogap state\nare expected ones.\nContrary to the other magnetic properties, experiments have shown that the uniform spin susceptibility\ndecreases from much higher temperature than T \u2217 [ 67, 70]. The decrease becomes more rapid below T \u2217\n[ 64]. We show the calculated results of the uniform susceptibility \u03c7s (0, 0) and staggard susceptibility\n\u03c7s (Q, 0) in Fig. 61(b). While the staggard susceptibility shows the pseudogap with the onset temperature\nT \u2217 determined from the 1/T1 T , the decrease of the uniform susceptibility begins from much higher\ntemperature and becomes rapid below T \u2217 . Thus, the qualitatively different behavior of the uniform\nsusceptibility is consistently obtained by simultaneously taking account of the spin and SC fluctuations.\nThe frequency dependence of the spin susceptibility well characterizes the magnetic properties in the\npseudogap state. The results for the dynamical spin susceptibility at q = Q is shown in Fig. 62 [ 11]. We\nsee the suppression of the real part in the low-frequency region, that is, the magnetic order is suppressed by\nthe SC fluctuation. The imaginary part in the low-frequency region is more remarkably suppressed in the\npseudogap state. At the same time, the spin excitation develops in the higher-frequency region. In other\nwords, the pseudogap transfers the spectral weight of the spin fluctuation from the low- to high-frequency\nregion. This is just the pseudogap phenomenon observed in the inelastic neutron scattering measurements\n[ 82]. This character in the frequency dependence indicates that the pseudogap has the smaller energy\nscale than that of the magnetic excitation. We stress that this is a natural consequence of the pairing\nscenario. These features are consistent with the above discussion on the NMR 1/T2G . It is notable that\nthe spin fluctuation in the relatively wide frequency region contributes to the pairing interaction. The\nlow-frequency component rather gives a de-pairing effect through the self-energy. Therefore, the d-wave\npairing is not suppressed by the pseudogap in the spin fluctuation. We have actually confirmed that the\nfeedback effect rather enhances the d-wave superconductivity [ 11].\nThe detailed momentum dependence of the magnetic excitation is a current interest brought by the\n\n\f71\n\nFigure 63. Doping dependence of the incommensurability \u03b4 [ 425], which is defined by the peak of\nthe magnetic excitation at (\u03c0, (1 \u00b1 \u03b4)\u03c0) and ((1 \u00b1 \u03b4)\u03c0, \u03c0). The inset shows the Fermi surface in the\nelectron-doped region.\n\nFigure 64.

There are detailed analysis by using the FLEX approximation [ 188, 425]. Then,\nthe magnetic excitation is commensurate in the under-doped region and becomes incommensurate with\nhole-doping. It is robustly commensurate in the electron-doped case (Fig. 63). The long-range hopping\nterm t\u2032 plays an essential role in this structure. The qualitatively same results have been obtained in the\nRVB theory including the long-range hopping [ 312]. These features are qualitatively consistent with the\ninelastic neutron scattering for La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 [ 75, 76] and Nd2\u2212x Cex CuO4\u2212y [ 79]. The same result for\nthe electron-doped cuprates has been reported by the numerical studies on the Hubbard model [ 16, 426]\nand t-J model [ 427].\nRecently, interesting temperature and frequency dependence has been reported for YBa2 Cu3 O6+\u03b4 ,\nBi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8+\u03b4 , and La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 [ 77, 78, 80]. The commensurate magnetic excitation is observed\nat high temperature and the incommensurability develops below the onset temperature above Tc . Here\nit is shown that these features can be explained by taking account of the pseudogap induced by the SC\nfluctuation [ 11]. First we point out that the SC fluctuation generally enhances the incommensurability.\nAlthough the commensurate peak is obtained by the FLEX approximation (Fig. 64(a)), it becomes incommensurate owing to the SC fluctuation (Fig. 64(b)). These features result from the d-wave momentum\ndependence of the pseudogap in the spectral function. The spectral gap around (\u03c0, 0) reduces the spin\nexcitation at q = Q more remarkably than the incommensurate component. The similar effect is expected\nin the superconducting state. Thus, the incommensurate structure in the low-temperature region can be\nexplained as an effect of the pseudogap or SC gap. If so, the incommensurate structure disappears in the\nhigh-frequency region as is shown in Fig. 64(c), which has been observed in the experiments [ 77, 78, 80].\nThis is simply because the pseudogap appears only in the low-frequency region. The incommensurate\nstructure disappears with increasing the temperature, owing to the closing of the pseudogap. Thus, the\nwhole temperature and frequency dependences are consistent with the incommensurability induced by\nthe pseudogap. It should be stressed that the incommensurate structure observed in inelastic neutron\n\n\f72\nscattering does not necessarily mean the stripe order.\n4.3.4. Transport properties\nIn this subsection, we discuss the transport phenomena which have been one of the central issues of the\ncuprate superconductors. The understanding for the anomalous behaviors consistent with the magnetic\nproperties has been a fundamental problem for a long time. A solution is provided by the FLEX+T-matrix\napproximation in the following way. Then, the anomalous properties above T \u2217 are explained by taking\nthe spin fluctuation into account [ 84, 85, 86, 93, 94], and those below T \u2217 are explained by simultaneously\ntaking account of the spin and SC fluctuations [ 90]. In the RVB theory, the electric conductivity around\nT \u2217 is explained by taking account of the coupling between the spinons and holons through the gauge\nfield [ 313, 315, 316]. The singlet pairing of the spinon weakly affects the charge transport carried by the\nholon. On the contrary, our understanding is based on the characteristic momentum dependences of the\nquasi-particle properties.\nBefore describing the microscopic theories, we introduce the general formula for the electric transport\non the basis of the Fermi-liquid theory. According to the Kubo formula, the electric conductivity is\nexpressed as the current-current correlation function\n\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd\n\n=\n\nK\u03bc\u03bd (\u03c9n ) =\n\nR\nImK\u03bc\u03bd\n(\u03c9)\ne2 lim\n,\n\u03c9=0\n\u03c9\nZ \u03b2\nd\u03c4 hT\u03c4 J\u03bc (\u03c4 )J\u03bd (0)iei\u03c9n \u03c4 ,\n\n(94)\n(95)\n\n0\n\nwhere \u03c9n = 2n\u03c0T is the bosonic Matsubara frequency.\nSince the conductivity is infinite in the non-interacting system, some procedure of the renormalization\nis required in the perturbation expansion. Then, the expression for K R (\u03c9) is generally complicated\nin the process of the analytic continuation. However, \u00c9liashberg has given a compact formula for the\nlongitudinal conductivity \u03c3xx by taking the most divergent terms with respect to the quasi-particle lifetime\n\u03c4 (k) = 1/|Im\u03a3 R (k, 0)| [ 428]. This procedure is correct in the coherent limit lmax = v(k)\u03c4 (k)|max \u226b 1,\nwhich is justified in the low-temperature region. The exceptional case is a system close to the phase\ntransition. For example, the Aslamazov-Larkin (AL) term [ 393] in the SC fluctuation theory is higher\norder with respect to 1/lmax, but divergent at the critical point. We will estimate the AL-term afterward\nand conclude that its contribution is not important [ 90].\nUsing the Green function, the \u00c9liashberg formula is expressed as\nX Z d\u03b5\n2\n(\u2212f \u2032 (\u03b5))|GR (k, \u03b5)|2 \u1e7d\u03bc (k, \u03b5)J\u03bc (k, \u03b5),\n(96)\n\u03c3\u03bc\u03bc = e\n\u03c0\nk\nwhere \u1e7d\u03bc (k, \u03b5) = v\u03bc (k) + \u2202Re\u03a3 (k, \u03b5)/\u2202k\u03bc is the velocity including the k-mass renormalization. Note\nthat the k-mass renormalization corresponds to a part of the vertex correction. The total current vertex\nJ~(k, \u03b5) is obtained by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation\nJ\u03bc (k, \u03b5) = \u1e7d\u03bc (k, \u03b5) +\n\nX Z d\u03b5\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nI22 (k, \u03b5 : k\u2032 , \u03b5 )|GR (k\u2032 , \u03b5 )|2 J\u03bc (k\u2032 , \u03b5 ).\n4\u03c0i\nk\u2032\n\u2032\n\n(97)\n\nThe vertex function I22 (k, \u03b5 : k\u2032 , \u03b5 ) is obtained by the analytic continuation of the irreducible four-point\n~ \u03b5) is usually the main\nparticle-hole vertex [ 428]. The renormalization of the total current vertex J(k,\ncontribution of the vertex correction. In the following, we use \"the vertex correction\" as the correction\n\u2032\narising from the vertex function I22 (k, \u03b5 : k\u2032 , \u03b5 ).\nThe expression for the Hall conductivity \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd corresponding to Eq. (96) has been given by Kohno and\nYamada [ 429]:\nX Z d\u03b5\n(\u2212f \u2032 (\u03b5))|ImGR (k, \u03b5)||GR (k, \u03b5)|2\n\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212He3\n\u03c0\nk\n\u00d7\u1e7d\u03bc (k, \u03b5)[J\u03bc (k, \u03b5)\u2202J\u03bd (k, \u03b5)/\u2202k\u03bd \u2212 J\u03bd (k, \u03b5)\u2202J\u03bc (k, \u03b5)/\u2202k\u03bd ].\n(98)\n\n\f73\n\n~ Here the hot and cold\nFigure 65. The schematic figure of the band velocity ~v and total current vertex J.\nspots are shown. The dashed line indicates the magnetic Brillouin zone boundary, while the dotted line\ndenotes the wave vector Q = (\u03c0, \u03c0). Note that the angle \u03b8 is also used in other figures.\n\nIn case of the Hall conductivity, the most divergent term with respect to \u03c4 (k) is the quadratic term. In\nthis section, the magnetic field is fixed to be parallel to the c-axis H k c, and the current J is fixed to be\nperpendicular to the c-axis J \u22a5 c.\nThe vertex correction is generally required in order to satisfy the Ward identity which corresponds to\nthe momentum conservation law [ 430, 431, 432, 433]. When the current operator commutes with the\nHamiltonian, the infinite conductivity is generally expected. However, the finite conductivity is obtained\nwhen we consider only the self-energy correction. The infinite conductivity is derived by taking into\naccount the vertex correction according to the scheme of Baym and Kadanoff. In the lattice system with\nUmklapp processes, however, the current operator does not commute with the Hamiltonian. Then, the\nvertex corrections are usually taken into account by only multiplying a constant factor, and have no\nimportant role [ 430]. This argument is based on the assumption that the temperature dependence of the\nfour-point vertex is negligible, which is justified in the conventional Fermi-liquid. However, the vertex\ncorrection sometimes gives a significant effect, when a collective mode induces a temperature dependence\nof the four-point vertex [ 93, 94]. This case is realized in the under-doped region.\nThe above expressions (Eqs. (96) and (98)) are rewritten in the Fermi-liquid limit z(k)\u03b3(k) \u226a T as\nX\nz(k)(\u2212f \u2032 (\u03b5\u2217 (k)))\u1e7dx (k, \u03b5\u2217 (k))Jx (k, \u03b5\u2217 (k))/\u03b3(k, \u03b5\u2217 (k)),\n(99)\n\u03c3xx = e2\nk\nZ\ndk \u1e7dx (k)\n\u223c\nJ (k)\u03c4 (k),\n(100)\n= e2\n2 \u1e7d(k) x\n(2\u03c0)\nFS\nHe3 X\n\u03c3xy = \u2212\nz(k)(\u2212f \u2032 (\u03b5\u2217 (k)))\u1e7dx (k, \u03b5\u2217 (k))\n2\nk\n\u2202Jx (k, \u03b5\u2217 (k))\n\u2202Jy (k, \u03b5\u2217 (k))\n\u2212 Jy (k, \u03b5\u2217 (k))\n]/\u03b3(k, \u03b5\u2217 (k))2 ,\n(101)\n\u00d7[Jx (k, \u03b5\u2217 (k))\n\u2202ky\n\u2202ky\nZ\nHe3\n\u2202\u03c6(k)\ndk ~\n\u223c\n|J(k)|2 (\n)\u03c4 (k)2 .\n(102)\n=\n4 FS (2\u03c0)2\n\u2202kk\nWe have used the definition \u1e7d\u03bc (k) = \u1e7d\u03bc (k, 0), J\u03bc (k) = J\u03bc (k, 0), and so on. Above expressions are similar\nto the consequence of the Boltzmann equation; the velocity is replaced by the total current vertex J\u03bc . In\nEq. (102), we have defined the angle of the current vertex as \u03c6(k) = Arctan(Jx (k)/Jy (k)) (see Fig. 65).\nIt should be noticed that the Hall conductivity depends on the differential of the angle \u03c6(k) with respect\nto the momentum along the Fermi surface kk . In the isotropic systems, the current vertex is always\nperpendicular to the Fermi surface, and therefore the relation RH \u221d 1/n is proved. This expression is,\nhowever, very delicate. It is clearly understood from the above expressions (Eqs. (96)-(102)) that the\nHall coefficient is not directly related to the carrier number n. The electric transport is determined by\nthe quasi-particles near the Fermi surface, not by the excitations deeply below the Fermi level.\nIn the following, we use Eqs. (96)-(98), although Eqs. (99)-(102) are expected to give qualitatively same\nresults. The resulting resistivity \u03c1 and Hall coefficient RH are obtained by the formula, \u03c1 = 1/\u03c3xx and\n\n\f74\n\nFigure 66.

The diagrams (b) and (c) are usually negligible.\n\n2\nRH = \u03c3xy /\u03c3xx\nH, respectively. Hereafter, the constant factor arising from the unit of charge e is omitted.\nIt should be noted that the coherent transport is assumed in the above expressions which are based on\nthe Fermi-liquid theory. This assumption seems to be incompatible with the pseudogap induced by the\n\"resonance scattering\", where the extremely large damping is the origin of the pseudogap. However, this\ndifficulty is removed by the characteristic momentum dependence; the pseudogap occurs at the hot spot,\nwhile the in-plane transport is determined by the cold spot as explained below. Because the coherent\nnature of the quasi-particles is sufficiently maintained at the cold spot (Figs. 65 and 67), the above\nformula are justified even in the pseudogap state.\nNow let us explain the microscopic theories. First the results of the spin fluctuation theory are reviewed [\n90, 93]. We show the calculated results of the resistivity and Hall coefficient in the FLEX approximation.\nThe four-point vertex in the FLEX approximation includes three terms (see Fig. 66). Because the\nspin-fluctuation Maki-Thompson (SPMT) term shown in Fig. 66(a) is dominant among them, only the\nSPMT-term is taken into account [ 90, 93, 94]\nWe provide a detailed explanation because a part of the following understanding is obtained in recent\nyears. The T -linear law of the electric resistivity and the enhancement of the Hall coefficient are discussed.\nThese behaviors are the characteristics of the nearly AF Fermi liquid and observed in the experimental\nresults above T \u2217 .\nWe point out three important properties from which the unconventional transport above T \u2217 is explained. The first is the momentum dependence of the quasi-particle lifetime \u03c4 (k). The typical results\nare shown in Fig. 67. We see that the lifetime is long at the cold spot \u03b8 \u223c \u03c0/4 and short at the hot spot\n\u03b8 \u223c 0 or \u223c \u03c0/2 [ 84, 85, 86]. When the exchange of the AF spin fluctuation is the dominant scattering\nprocess, the quasi-particle damping \u03b3(k) = \u2212Im\u03a3 R (k, 0) is almost determined by the low-energy DOS\naround k\u2032 = k + Q. Then, the lifetime is short around the magnetic Brillouin zone boundary and/or\naround the van Hove singularity. The electric transport is practically carried by the quasi-particles at\nthe cold spot which is located around k = (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) (see Fig. 65). This momentum dependence of\nthe lifetime affects the spectral function, as is explained in Sec. 4.3.1, which is actually observed in the\nARPES measurements [ 45, 106, 434, 435]. Also the magnetic-transport measurement has confirmed this\nmomentum dependence [ 436].\nThe second is the T -linear dependence of the damping rate \u03b3c = \u03b3(kc ), where kc is the momentum at\nthe cold spot. The T -linear resistivity originates from this T -linear dependence [ 84, 85, 86]. It have been\npointed out that the T 2 -resistivity is always obtained in the low-temperature limit even in the quantum\ncritical point unless the Fermi surface is perfectly nested [ 86]. This is because the quasi-particles at the\ncold spot are not directly scattered by the AF spin fluctuation at q = Q. Note that the anomalous powerlaw can be induced by the slight impurity scattering near the quantum critical point [ 437]. However, the\ncrossover temperature from T -square to T -linear resistivity is sufficiently small in the under-doped region\n(Fig. 68(a)). The transformation of the Fermi surface plays a role to reduce the crossover temperature [\n86].\nThe third is the temperature dependence of the vertex correction [ 93, 94]. We will see that the\n~\ncontribution from the SPMT-term to the total current vertex J(k)\nsignificantly enhances the Hall coef~\nficient. The schematic figure (Fig. 65) shows that the total current vertex J(k)\nis significantly altered\n\n\f75\n\nFigure 67. The momentum dependence of the lifetime \u03c4 (k) on the Fermi surface. The circles and triangles\ncorrespond to T = 0.005 and T = 0.009, respectively and U/t = 3.2. The solid curve is a result in the\nelectron-doped region (\u03b4 = \u22120.10, U/t = 3 and T = 0.018).\n\nFigure 68. The results of the FLEX approximation at U/t = 3.2. (a)The resistivity and (b) Hall coefficient\nin under-doped (\u03b4 = 0.09, circles), optimally-doped (\u03b4 = 0.15, squares), and electron-doped (\u03b4 = \u22120.1,\nstars) region.\n\nfrom the band velocity ~v (k). This is an effect of the AF spin fluctuation. Then, the four-point vertex\n\u2032\nI22 (k, \u03b5 : k\u2032 , \u03b5 ) is significantly enhanced around k \u2212 k\u2032 = Q. In the vicinity of the magnetic instability, the differential \u2202\u03c6(k)/\u2202kk increases around the cold spot. Therefore, the Hall coefficient increases\nwith the development of the spin fluctuation (Fig. 68(b)). The vertex correction is not so important\nfor the resistivity. The resistivity is enhanced by the SPMT-term, however, the qualitative temperature\ndependence is not altered (Fig. 68(a)).\nThe nearly AF Fermi-liquid theory explains the transport phenomena also in the electron-doped region.\nThen, the cold spot is located around (\u03c0, \u03c0/4) and (\u03c0/4, \u03c0), as is shown in Fig. 67, where the Fermi\nsurface is far from the magnetic Brillouin zone (see Fig. 25). The large damping around the magnetic\nBrillouin zone is consistent with the observation in the ARPES measurements [ 418], which confirms\nthis picture. Then, the electric transport shows considerably different behaviors. Combined with the\nsharp commensurate structure of the magnetic excitation (Fig. 21), the quasi-particle lifetime at the cold\nspot follows the usual T -square law. Note that the lifetime is much longer than the hole-doped case.\nTherefore, the resistivity shows the T -square law with a small magnitude [ 11]. More interestingly, the\nHall coefficient changes its sign because the differential of the angle \u2202\u03c6(k)/\u2202kk has negative sign around\n(\u03c0, \u03c0/4) [ 93, 94]. These behaviors are consistent with the experimental results [ 23, 26, 91].\nIn the following part, we take account of the SC fluctuation and discuss the electric transport in the\npseudogap state [ 90]. In order to make the discussion clear, we classify the effects of the SC fluctuation\nin the following way.\n1. The pseudogap in the single-particle properties.\n2. The feedback effects through the AF spin fluctuation.\n3. The vertex corrections from the SC fluctuation. The AL-term is classified into them.\n\n\f76\n\nFigure 69. (a) The temperature dependence of the resistivity \u03c1 at U/t = 4.0 without the effect (3). The\nclosed and open symbols show the results with and without the SPMT-term, respectively. (b) The effects\nof the vertex correction. The results with the SCMT-term and with the SCMT- and AL-terms are shown.\n\nFigure 70. (a) The four-point vertex in the lowest order with respect to the SC fluctuation (SCMTterm). (b) The Feynmann diagram representing the AL-term. The wavy dashed line represents the SC\nfluctuation.\n\nThe following calculation identifies the effect (2) as a main contribution. That is, the coupling between\nthe spin and SC fluctuations plays an essential role for the electric transport. Therefore, we perform the\nself-consistent FLEX+T-matrix (SCFT) approximation [ 11] in which the dynamical spin susceptibility,\nT-matrix, and the Green function are determined self-consistently.\nWe first discuss the resistivity. The effect (1) obviously reduces the longitudinal and transverse conductivities. However, the increase of the resistivity is not significant because the pseudogap occurs at the\nhot spot which is not important for the transport phenomena. It should be noted that the self-energy at\nthe cold spot is always dominated by the spin fluctuation. Then, the effect (2) increases the conductivity\nand gives the larger contribution than (1). The quasi-particle damping arising from the spin fluctuation\n\u03b3F (k) = \u2212Im\u03a3FR (k, 0) is reduced by the pseudogap in the spin excitation. Thus, the SC fluctuation induces the downward deviation of the resistivity around T = T \u2217 (Fig. 69(a)) through the feedback effect.\nThis downward deviation becomes more remarkable as decreasing the hole-doping, which is consistent\nwith the experimental results [ 87, 88, 89, 98].\nIt is another important property that the deviation of the resistivity is only a slight one, while the\nNMR 1/T1 T is remarkably reduced by the SC fluctuation. This is because the cold spot is not so\nsensitive to spin fluctuation at q = Q. As shown in Fig. 64, the suppression of the magnetic excitation\nis moderate for the incommensurate component q 6= Q. This is an origin of the incommensurate peak in\nthe pseudogap state. Since the quasi-particle damping at the cold spot is determined by some average\nof the incommensurate component, the enhancement of the lifetime is not so significant. Thus, the\nweak response of the resistivity to the pseudogap is explained by the detailed analysis of the momentum\ndependence. This explanation is in sharp contrast with that in the RVB theory [ 313, 315, 316].\nWe have clarified the role of the vertex correction arising from the SC fluctuation [ 90]. Then, we have\nestimated the lowest-order term within the \u00c9liashberg theory (\"SCMT-term\") and the AL-term [ 393]\nbeyond the \u00c9liashberg theory (Fig. 70). Both contributions increase the conductivity. It should be noted\n\n\f77\nthat the SCMT term is not equivalent to the Maki-Thompson term [ 394] which has been investigated\nin the fluctuation theory [ 369, 406, 438]. The SCMT term includes the lowest order contribution\nwith respect to 1/\u03c4 (k), and take into account the vertex correction iteratively. Note that the diffusion\npropagator, which is important in the s-wave superconductor, is negligible in the d-wave superconductor.\nFigure 69(b) shows that the SCMT-term does not affect the temperature dependence, qualitatively.\nThis is mainly because of the momentum dependence of the d-wave order parameter. Although the contribution from the SCMT-term increases as the temperature decreases, it is not visible in the temperature\ndependence of the resistivity because the other contribution to the conductivity also increases.\nThe role of the AL-term may be interesting because this contribution has been intensively investigated\nin the fluctuation theory [ 369, 406, 438, 439]. The AL-term is interpreted as the conductivity carried\nby the fluctuating Cooper-pairs [ 440], and should be written as the superconducting part \u03c3s in contrast\nto the normal part \u03c3n included in the \u00c9liashberg theory. We have concluded that the AL-term is almost\nnegligible in the wide temperature range (see Fig.69(b)). This is simply because the AL-term is higher\norder with respect to the parameter 1/lmax = 1/v(kc )\u03c4 (k c ). The AL-term becomes dominant just above\nTc because this term is more divergent with respect to 1/t0 = 1/(1 \u2212 \u03bb(0)). However, this temperature\nrange is narrow because of the long lifetime of the quasi-particle at the cold spot. The detailed analysis\non the fluctuation conductivity in the vicinity of the critical point has been performed within the weakcoupling theory [ 369, 406, 438, 439]. Here we stress that the downward deviation of the resistivity is not\nattributed to the AL-term, but to the feedback effect through the suppression of the spin fluctuation.\nHere we discuss the role of the AL-term furthermore, since some characteristics of the high-Tc cuprates\nmanifest. There are two important points in the above discussion on the AL-term. One is the strongcoupling superconductivity. While the resonance scattering is strong in the superconductor with short\ncoherence length, the AL-term does not directly depend on the coherence length in two dimensions [\n393, 440]. This is because the short coherence length means the small velocity of the fluctuating Cooperpairs. Then, the pseudogap occurs under not so small value of t0 where the AL-term is still small. The\nother is the characteristic momentum dependences in high-Tc cuprates. For example, in case of the\nstrong-coupling s-wave superconductors, the AL-term will be much more important. This is because the\npseudogap opens on the whole Fermi surface and therefore the normal part \u03c3n is remarkably suppressed.\nLet us comment on the c-axis transport, which shows qualitatively different behaviors from the in-plane\ntransport. That is, the c-axis transport is strongly incoherent in the pseudogap state, while the in-plane\ntransport is sufficiently coherent [ 98]. We can understand these qualitatively different behaviors in a\nconsistent way. Then, the momentum dependence of the inter-layer hopping matrix plays an essential\nrole [ 86, 97]. The result of the band calculation has shown the following behavior [ 99],\nt\u22a5 (k) = t\u22a5 (coskx \u2212 cosky )2 .\n\n(103)\n\nIn short, the inter-layer hopping matrix vanishes at the cold spot and the c-axis transport is mainly\ndetermined by the hot spot. Therefore, the c-axis conductivity is significantly reduced by the effect (1).\nActually, the incoherent nature of the c-axis optical conductivity has been obtained in the pseudogap\nstate within the FLEX+T-matrix approximation, together with the coherent nature of the in-plane optical\nconductivity [ 441]. This is an experimentally observed behavior [ 100, 101, 102].\nNaively, it may be expected that the AL-term is important in the c-axis transport instead of the quasiparticle transport. However, the AL-term is higher order with respect to the inter-layer hopping, i.e.,\n\u03c3s \u221d t4\u22a5 while \u03c3n \u221d t2\u22a5 [ 406, 439]. Therefore, the AL-term is negligible in the quasi-2D system. We\nstress that the qualitative difference between the c-axis and in-plane transport is not attributed to the\ndifference of the AL-term [ 406, 439], but to the difference of the normal part \u03c3n . In order to arrive at\nthis conclusion, we have to consider the spin and SC fluctuations simultaneously and to take account of\nthe momentum dependent inter-layer hopping matrix.\nFinally let us discuss the Hall coefficient. The Hall coefficient increases owing to the effect (1), because\nthe momentum dependence of the lifetime is enhanced by (1). Actually, the SC fluctuation was proposed\nto be the origin of the enhancement of the Hall coefficient [ 97]. However, the situation is quite altered\nby taking account of the SPMT-term. The kernel of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (Eq. (97)) includes\nthe four-point vertex arising from the spin fluctuation and the absolute value of the Green function.\nTherefore, the vertex correction is reduced by the feedback effect (2) and furthermore by the effect (1).\nAs a result, the Hall coefficient is reduced by the SC fluctuation through the SPMT-term. We have\nconfirmed that the feedback effect (2) is dominant also for the Hall coefficient. The calculated results\n\n\f78\n\nFigure 71. (a) The temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient RH at U/t = 4.0 without the effect\n(3). The circles and squares correspond to \u03b4 = 0.09 and \u03b4 = 0.15, respectively. (b) The effects of the\nvertex correction. The meanings of the lines are the same as in Fig. 69(b).\n\nFigure 72. The phase diagram obtained by the FLEX and SCFT approximations.\n\nin Fig. 71 clearly show the pseudogap behavior of the Hall coefficient. The Hall coefficient shows the\npeak around T = 0.006 and decreases with decreasing the temperature. This phenomenon becomes\nmoderate with increasing the hole-doping. These results qualitatively explain the experimental results in\nthe pseudogap state including the doping dependence [ 87, 88, 91, 95, 96].\nThe vertex correction arising from the SCMT-term enhances the momentum dependence of the angle\n\u03c6(k) [ 90]. Therefore, the Hall coefficient is enhanced by the vertex correction arising from the SC\nfluctuation. It is notable that this enhancement does not occur without the SPMT-term. In other wards,\nthe SCMT-term indirectly enhances the Hall coefficient through the combination with the SPMT-term.\nFigure 71(b) shows that this enhancement is not so significant to alter the qualitative behaviors. This\nis also because of the wave function of the d-wave superconductivity. Including the AL-term in the\nlongitudinal conductivity, the suppression of the Hall coefficient becomes clearer.\nThus, the transport coefficients in the pseudogap state are explained by simultaneously taking into\naccount the spin fluctuation and SC fluctuation. It is confirmed that characteristic behaviors of the\nelectric transport are mainly caused by the feedback effect through the pseudogap in the spin fluctuation.\nThis effect is not outstanding in the resistivity, but rather apparent in the Hall coefficient. This difference\nreflects the importance of the SPMT-term for these quantities. We stress that the conventional theory\non the fluctuation conductivity is not satisfactory, but detailed knowledge on the electronic structure are\nrequired for the understanding of high-Tc cuprates.\nRecently, the theory including the spin and SC fluctuations has been extended to the thermal transport\n[ 442]. It is shown that the vertex correction from the SCMT-term combined with the SPMT-term\nsignificantly enhances the Nernst coefficient. This feature is also consistent with the experiments [ 443].\nAlthough the vortex excitation has been considered as an origin of this behavior [ 443], we consider\nthat the contribution from quasi-particles is dominant in the wide temperature region like for the electric\nconductivity. That is, the understanding within the \u00c9liashberg theory will be relevant also for the thermal\ntransport. The importance of the superconducting part in the vicinity of the critical point is common.\nThe analysis on the superconducting part under the magnetic field has been recently given [ 444].\n\n\f79\n4.3.5. Phase diagram\nAt the last of this section, we show the phase diagram in Fig. 72. The SCFT approximation is used\nto estimate Tc suppressed by the fluctuation. The effects of the SC fluctuation are similarly classified\ninto the following two parts: (1) The pseudogap in the single-particle properties. (2) The feedback\neffect through the spin fluctuation. We have concluded that the feedback effect enhances the transition\ntemperature [ 11]. The spin fluctuation has both the pairing and de-pairing effects. Since the lowfrequency component mainly affects as a de-pairing source, the pseudogap in the spin fluctuation rather\nenhances the superconductivity (see also Sec. 4.3.3). However, the effect (1) is dominant in the present\ncase and significantly suppresses Tc . Note here that strictly speaking, the transition temperature should\nbe always zero (Tc = 0) in the two-dimension, which is known as the Mermin-Wagner theorem. However,\nthe singularity of the two-dimensional system is always removed in the layered systems. Taking account\nof the weak inter-layer coupling, we determine the critical point as \u03bbe = 0.98 instead of \u03bbe = 1. This\ncriterion corresponds to the 2D-3D crossover of the SC fluctuation with the anisotropy being \u03beab /\u03bec = 10\nand \u03beab = 2 \u223c 3.\nIt is shown that the suppression of Tc from the mean-field value becomes remarkable with underdoping. This is a natural consequence because the SC fluctuation becomes strong with under-doping\n(see Sec. 4.3.2). In other words, the pseudogap develops with under-doping and the reduced DOS gives\nthe suppressed Tc . It is an interesting result that the transition temperature takes the maximum value\nat \u03b4 \u223c 0.11 and decreases with under-doping in the SCFT approximation for U/t = 4.4. This feature\nis in sharp contrast to the FLEX approximation where the Tc goes on increasing with decreasing \u03b4\n(see also Sec. 3.2.4). Thus, the mean-field transition temperature develops with under-doping, however,\nthe strong SC fluctuation decreases the Tc in the under-doped region. This picture is consistent with\nthe experimental results from the tunnelling measurements [ 110, 89], where the SC gap develops with\ndecreasing \u03b4 in the under-doped region. We can see from Fig. 72 that the decrease of Tc in the underdoped region is only a slight one in case of U/t = 3.2. Thus, the strong electron correlation plays an\nessential role for describing the under-doped region. It is also important that we can treat the strong\ncorrelation by considering the SC fluctuation which suppresses the AF order. The stabilization of the\nmetallic state by the SC fluctuation is actually expected in the hole-doped cuprates.\nIt is worth while to write again that the strength of the SC coupling is indicated by the ratio TcMF /EF ,\nand not by Tc . Since the mean-field transition temperature TcMF increases and the effective Fermi energy\nEF decreases with under-doping, the superconductivity becomes strong coupling in spite of the decreasing\nTc . Thus, the decreasing Tc in the under-doped region is obtained by starting from the microscopic\nHamiltonian and taking account of the SC fluctuation. This is an important development for the theory\nstarting from the Fermi-liquid state. As has been discussed in Sec. 3.2.5, the SCFT approximation\nunderestimates the effects of the SC fluctuation. Therefore, the more significant doping dependence is\nexpected in the higher-order theory, which is beyond the scope of this review.\nIt is quite clear that the SCFT approximation is not sufficient to show the disappearance of the\nsuperconductivity. If we describe the phase boundary between the SC phase and the spin glass phase,\nthe loss of the metallic behavior will be an essential aspect. Then, the validity of the FLEX approximation\nwill be a subject. The systematic treatment for the electron correlation and the disorder will be necessary\nfor this issue. This is an interesting and open problem.\n\n\f80\n5. Heavy-Fermion Systems\nIn previous sections, we have discussed the superconductivity in high-Tc cuprates, organic superconductors, and Sr2 RuO4 . The pairing mechanism and several physical properties of these materials have\nbeen explained. In the calculation of the transition temperature within the mean-field theory, we have\nadopted the third-order perturbation (TOP) theory with respect to the on-site Coulomb repulsion U for\nthe weak-coupling case. When the anti-ferromagnetic (AF) spin fluctuation is strongly enhanced, the\nfluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation has been applied. In general, these two methods are useful\nfor the weak and intermediate coupling regimes in U .\nHere note that the above approaches stand on a common basis of the Fermi-liquid state. As far as\nthe system is in a metallic state, or more strictly, the existence of Fermi-liquid quasi-particles is insured,\nsuch methods have an established basis. This is related to the analytic property in U and the continuity\nprinciple stressed by P. W. Anderson [ 445]. In this case, the long-lived Fermi-liquid quasi-particles form\nthe Fermi surface at low temperatures. The superconductivity is induced by the effective interaction\namong quasi-particles and the paring symmetry is determined by the momentum dependence of the fourpoint vertex function, which is naturally caused by the short-range repulsion through the many-body\neffect. Thus, the superconductivity in strongly correlated materials discussed above can be understood\nfrom such a unified view.\nOn the other hand, the superconductivity in heavy-fermion compounds, which are the typical SCES\nmaterials, has not been explained from the microscopic point of view, mainly due to the complicated\nband structures and the strong correlation effect. However, we believe that the key mechanism of the\nsuperconductivity in these compounds should be also explained on the same footing as described in\nprevious sections. It is expected that such efforts will extend the universality of the understanding on\nthe superconductivity. Then, the identification of the residual interaction between the quasi-particles is\nan essential task for this purpose.\nIn this section, we introduce a strategy to treat heavy-fermion superconductors and discuss the possible applications to some Ce-based and U-based heavy-fermion superconductors. Then, we analyze the\neffective single f -band model by choosing one dominant band. Further analysis based on more realistic\nmodels is a desirable future issue, but we believe that the essential physics will be unchanged and the\ndiscussion in this section will be a basis in the future progress.\n5.1. Experimental view\nMost of intermetallic compounds with several localized f -electrons at each atomic site exhibit some\nkinds of magnetic transition by the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction. Some of Cebased and U-based compounds, however, form coherent itinerant electron bands at low temperatures due\nto the mixing effect with conduction electrons, while they possess magnetic characters at high temperatures. Such electron systems are frequently called \"heavy-fermion systems\" [ 446], since the effective\nmass of the itinerant electron becomes several hundred times larger than free-electron mass m0 due to\nthe strong electron correlation. In 1979, the superconductivity in CeCu2 Si2 , which is one of typical\nheavy-fermion systems, has been reported by Steglich et al. [ 6]. The discovery of the superconductivity in the material with remarkable magnetic characters has implied a scenario clearly different from\nthe electron-phonon mechanism in the conventional BCS theory. In fact, physical properties in the superconducting phase at low temperature have shown power-law temperature dependence, different from\nexponential decay observed in the conventional s-wave superconductor. Thus, CeCu2 Si2 has become the\npioneering discovery of unconventional superconductivity in SCES. It is now considered as an even-parity\nsuperconductor with line-nodes, probably d-wave pairing symmetry.\nSince then, many unconventional superconductors have been discovered in heavy-fermion systems.\nMulti-phase diagrams in UPt3 [ 274, 447, 448] and U(Be1\u2212x Thx )13 [ 12, 449, 450, 451] indicates curious\nsuperconductivity with multi-components. In particular, UPt3 is the odd-parity superconductor first\ndiscovered in electronic systems [ 13]. UPd2 Al3 and UNi2 Al3 [ 452, 453] are unconventional superconductors coexisting with the AF phase, and are considered to have even- and odd-parity pairing states,\nrespectively [ 454, 455]. URu2 Si2 indicates coexistence of unconventional superconductivity and a hidden\norder [ 456]. Furthermore, recent progress in experiments under pressures have promoted discoveries of\nnew superconductors: CeCu2 Ge2 [ 457, 458], CePd2 Si2 [ 459, 460], CeRh2 Si2 [ 461], CeNi2 Ge2 [ 462],\nand CeIn3 [ 460, 463]. These compounds are AF metals at ambient pressure, while under high pressures,\n\n\f81\nthe AF phases abruptly disappear accompanied by SC transitions. Except for cubic CeIn3 , all other\nmaterials have the same ThCr2 Si2 -type crystal structure as in CeCu2 Si2 .\nIn addition, quite recently, several kinds of new heavy-fermion superconductors have been discovered.\nOne is a family of CeTIn5 (T=Co, Rh, and Ir) with HoCoGa5 -type crystal structure [ 464, 465, 466].\nSince the discovery, a variety of experimental investigations have rapidly increased. These compounds\npossess relatively high transition temperature such as Tc = 2.3K for CeCoIn5 , which is the highest among\nheavy fermion superconductors observed yet. The dominant AF spin fluctuations have been suggested\nby the existence of the neighboring AF phase in the pressure-temperature (P \u2212 T ) phase diagram, the\npower-law (T 1\u223c1.3 ) behavior in the resistivity, and the magnetic behavior observed in the NQR/NMR\n1/T1. The situation is quite similar to other Ce-based superconductors mentioned above. Another\nis the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in UGe2 at high pressure and URhGe at\nambient pressure [ 275, 276]. Much attention has been attracted to features of the superconductivity,\nsince it is naively believed that a triplet pairing state coexists with the ferromagnetic phase. In fact, the\nunconventional T 3 -behavior has been observed in the NQR/NMR-1/T1 [ 467]. In addition, other new\nsuperconductors, including neither Ce nor U atom, have been also discovered and attracted attentions.\nIn the filled skutterudite compound PrOs4 Sb12 (Tc = 1.85K), the possibility of the double transition has\nbeen indicated [ 468]. In the Pu-based compound PuCoGa5 with the same crystal structure as a family\nof CeTIn5 , a very high transition temperature Tc = 18.5K has been reported [ 469].\nAs introduced above, heavy-fermion superconductors show a great variety of ground states and offer\nrich examples to investigate unconventional superconductivity in SCES. We cannot review here in detail\nthe superconductivity in each heavy-fermion compound. Alternatively, in the following subsections, we\noverview characteristic features in Ce-based and U-based heavy-fermion superconductors, relevant to the\nkey mechanism of the superconductivity. For more details of each material, readers can consult the review\narticles by Stewart [ 447], Grewe and Steglich [ 446], and Sigrist and Ueda [ 12].\n5.1.1. Ce-based compounds\nCe-based heavy-fermion compounds possess the typical nature of what is known as \"Kondo effect\" in\nthe impurity case [ 206]. The impurity Kondo problem is a typical example of the Fermi-liquid formation\nin many-body systems. The local spin fluctuation at impurity (Ce) site, observed at high temperatures,\nis quenched at low temperature by the mixing effect with the conduction electrons. The system forms the\nlocal Fermi-liquid state and has the singlet ground state as a whole. In the process, the resistivity shows\nthe log T -behavior with decreasing T and eventually arrives at the value of the unitarity limit. The change\nof the behavior is marked by a characteristic temperature TK , which is called the Kondo temperature.\nIn the actual case, there remains degeneracy in f orbitals. For instance, assuming that the crystal-field\n(CF) ground state is \u03937 doublet and the excited state is \u03938 quartet, we obtain the characteristic Kondo\ntemperature as [ 470]\n\u00132\n\u0012\nD\nD exp(\u2212N/\u03c1|J|),\n(104)\nTK =\nTK + \u2206\nwhere D, \u2206, and \u03c1|J|/N represent the conduction band-width, the CF splitting, and the Kondo coupling\nconstant, respectively. For T > \u2206, the higher Kondo temperature TKH \u2243 D exp(\u2212N/3\u03c1|J|) is effective,\nwhile for T < \u2206, the lower Kondo temperature TKL \u2243 (D/\u2206)2 D exp(\u2212N/\u03c1|J|) becomes effective. Then,\nthe resistivity shows the broad peak around TKH and the typical log T dependence around TKL . This is\nthe case also in the periodic lattice system. The different point from the impurity case is that in the\nperiodic lattice systems, the resistivity smoothly changes into a power-law decay (typically T 2 ) with a\nlarge coefficient A at lower temperature. This corresponds to the formation of coherent quasi-particle\nstates with a large effective mass m\u2217 , typically m\u2217 \u2243 100m0. Here note that there exists a heuristic\nrelation between the effective mass and the coefficient of the T 2 -resistivity. Actually, the KadowakiWoods' relation, A \u221d \u03b3 2 , has been found in many heavy-fermion compounds [ 471], where \u03b3 denotes the\nSommerfeld coefficient in the electronic specific heat. For instance, the resistivity in CeCu2 Si2 exhibits\ntwo hump structures at T \u223c 100K and \u223c 20K. Then, it smoothly changes into T 2 dependence at low\ntemperatures [ 6, 446, 451]. These two characteristic temperatures (T \u223c 100K and \u223c 20K) correspond\nto TKH and TKL , respectively. The metallic behavior with the T 2 -resistivity at low temperatures indicates\nthe formation of the coherent itinerant band of heavy quasi-particles. The coefficient A is also consistent\nwith the large enhanced value of the electronic specific-heat coefficient, \u03b3 = 0.7 \u2212 1.1J/K2mol.\n\n\f82\nThe compound CeCu2 Si2 undergoes the transition into the SC phase at Tc = 0.7K [ 6], marked by the\ndiscontinuity in the specific heat. The ratio of the jump to the normal-state specific heat \u2206C/\u03b3Tc is of\nthe order of unity (\u223c 1.4), which could be explained in terms of the conventional BCS theory. This fact is\na strong evidence for the fact that the superconductivity in this compound is a cooperative phenomenon\nin the heavy quasi-particles. It is natural to consider that the heavy quasi-particles on the Fermi surface\nform the Cooper-pairs with use of the residual interaction. In this case, a couple of quasi-particles prefer\nto form some anisotropic pairing state, not an s-wave one, in order to avoid the strong on-site repulsion.\nActually, CeCu2 Si2 in the SC phase exhibits the power-law dependence in physical quantities at low\ntemperatures, such as T 3 -dependence in the NMR/NQR 1/T1 [ 472, 473] and T 2 -dependence in the\nthermal conductivity \u03ba [ 474]. All these facts imply zeros of the gap along lines on the Fermi surface. In\naddition, the Knight shift decreases irrespective of directions of the crystallographic axis [ 475]. Thus, the\npairing symmetry is considered as an even-parity state with line nodes, and presumably d-wave symmetry\nfrom many similarities with the cuprates and the organic superconductors.\nOne of the remarkable similarities is the existence of the neighboring AF phase in the P \u2212 T phase\ndiagram and the phase diagram of chemical substitutions in a series of the isostructural compounds.\nThe ground state of CeCu2 (Si1\u2212x Gex )2 , with increasing x, changes from the SC phase to the AF phase\nthrough the coexistent phase, owing to negative chemical pressures by Ge substitution for Si [ 476, 477].\nThis property is similar to that of the organic superconductor, as is explained in Sec. 2.2. An isostructural\ncompound CeCu2 Ge2 is the incommensurate spin-density-wave (SDW) state with Q = (0.28, 0.28, 0.54)\nat ambient pressure [ 478]. Under high pressures around 7GPa, the magnetic phase abruptly disappears,\naccompanied by the SC transition with Tc = 0.5K [ 457, 458]. CePd2 Si2 [ 459, 460], CeRh2 Si2 [ 461], and\nCeNi2 Ge2 [ 462] also exhibit the transition from the AF metals to the SC phases (Tc \u2243 0.5K) under high\npressures. This is also the case in CeIn3 [ 460, 463] (Tc = 0.2K) with the cubic AuCu3 -type structure.\nThe remarkable AF spin fluctuation in these compounds is actually implied by some measurements. The\npower smaller than two of temperature (T 1\u223c1.5 ) is observed in the resistivity [ 460], and the NMR/NQR\n1/T1 T increases at low temperatures [ 476, 479, 480]. These properties are typical ones in the nearly\nAF Fermi-liquid in quasi-2D and 3D systems. The relationship of such AF spin fluctuation with the\nunconventional superconductivity has been intensively investigated, especially in the cuprates, from the\nmicroscopic point of view (see Sec. 3.2).\nA series of CeTIn5 (T=Co, Rh, and Ir) discovered recently [ 464, 465, 466] possess many similarities\nwith the cuprates and the organic superconductors. Thus, these compounds offer a great opportunity\nto bridge our understanding in Ce-based heavy-fermion superconductors, high-Tc cuprates, and organic\nsuperconductors. These compounds are quasi-2D materials with the layered structure, which has been\nconfirmed by the de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) measurements [ 481, 482, 483, 484, 485]. The P \u2212 T phase\ndiagram in CeRhIn5 [ 477] and the phase diagram in the alloy system CeRh1\u2212x Irx In5 [ 486] indicate\nthat the superconductivity appears in the neighborhood of the AF phase. The power-law behavior of the\nresistivity in the normal phase with T 1.3 in CeIrIn5 (Tc = 0.4K) [ 465] and T in CeCoIn5 (Tc = 2.3K) [ 466]\nimplies the strong quasi-2D AF spin fluctuation. In the SC phase, no coherence peak just below Tc , T 3 behavior at low temperatures in the NMR/NQR 1/T1 , and the decrease in the Knight shift irrespective\nof directions indicate the anisotropic even-parity superconductivity, similar to other Ce-based heavyfermion superconductors [ 487, 488, 489, 490, 491, 492]. In addition, the four-fold symmetry in the\nthermal conductivity in CeCoIn5 [ 493] strongly suggests the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave singlet pairing. Furthermore,\nthe pseudogap phenomenon has been reported in the 115 In-NQR measurement in CeRhIn5 in the range\nof pressures (P = 1.53 \u223c 1.75GPa), under which the coexistent phase exists [ 479]. These similarities,\nespecially the AF spin fluctuation and dx2 \u2212y2 -wave pairing, indicate that the underlying physics in\nthe superconductivity in these Ce-based heavy-fermion superconductors is in common with the cuprate\nsuperconductors. This is also inferred from the microscopic electronic state, where one f -electron exists\nper Ce site and the f -electron band itself is almost half-filled when the hybridization with the conduction\nelectron band is not taken into account.\nIn the latter section, we verify the validity of the argument by estimating Tc in the Ce-based heavyfermion superconductors on the same framework as in the cuprates. We introduce neither the coexistent\nphase in the boundary between the SC and AF phases nor the A phase with anomalous magnetic features\n[ 494]. Although these are one of interesting issues of f -electron systems, here we focused our interests\non the superconductivity itself.\n\n\f83\n5.1.2. U-based compounds\nNext we briefly review U-based heavy-fermion superconductors. They exhibit various kinds of SC\nphases probably owing to multi f -band structures with two or three f electrons per U site. We will show\na possibility of our argument even in such complicated systems.\nFirst we note that U-based compounds do not necessarily display clear log T dependence in the resistivity. This is attributed to the multi f -orbitals and relatively large hybridization terms with the\nconduction electrons. These properties also provide the complicated multi-band structures and many\nFermi surfaces with dominant f character. The Fermi surfaces obtained by the band calculations well explain the dHvA measurements. One of the characteristics of U-based compounds different from Ce-based\ncompounds is the clear coexistence between the SC phase and some kind of magnetic ordered phase.\nUPt3 is the odd-parity superconductor (Tc = 0.5K) discovered for the first time in the electronic systems\n[ 13, 274, 447, 448]. This superconductor coexists with an unusual AF order below TN = 5K [ 495], which\nis observed in the neutron scattering. Note that it has not been observed by the static and/or dynamically slow probes. This unusual AF order at Q = (0.5, 0, 1) becomes the long-range order below 20mK\nwithin the resolution of the neutron scattering [ 496]. In URu2 Si2 , the unconventional superconductivity\nbelow 1.5K also coexists with a hidden order with a clear jump at 17.5K in the specific heat [ 497, 498].\nUPd2 Al3 is an AF metal with Q = (0, 0, 0.5) below TN = 14.5K [ 499] and coexists with the anisotropic\neven-parity superconductivity below Tc = 2K [ 452, 454]. The isostructural compound UNi2 Al3 is in\nthe SDW state with Q = (0.5 \u00b1 \u03c4, 0, 0.5) and \u03c4 = 0.11 \u00b1 0.003 below TN = 4.6K [ 500, 501]. This\nSDW state coexists with the unconventional superconductivity below Tc = 1.2K [ 453], which may be the\nodd-parity state as indicated by the NMR/NQR measurement [ 455]. Recently, in UGe2 and URhGe,\nthe superconductivity in the ferromagnetic phase has been reported at Tc = 0.75K (for P =11.4kbar) and\n0.25K (ambient pressure), respectively [ 275, 276].\nAlthough such a variety of interesting phenomena have been observed experimentally, there are little theoretical progress from the microscopic point of view. One of the causes is the complicated band\nstructure, since U-based compounds possess several f electrons per U site and many Fermi-surface sheets\noriginating from multi f -orbitals. On the one hand, the complicated nature is unfavorable for the theoretical effort, but on the other hand, it is related to a great variety of the ground states. It seems to\nbe natural to consider that part of the Fermi surfaces stabilizing the magnetic phase is different from\nthat leading to the SC state, even though we cannot completely decouple them. Then, we can discuss\npossibility of the superconductivity by investigating the remaining Fermi surfaces in the magnetic phase.\nWe will introduce the simple application on the unconventional superconductivity in the AF phase in\nUPd2 Al3 and UNi2 Al3 later. The former is considered as an even-parity superconductor, while the latter\nis an odd-parity one. We will discuss how this difference occurs.\n5.2. Microscopic theory\nFirst we introduce a theoretical treatment of the heavy-fermion superconductors from the microscopic\npoint of view. As indicated in a variety of experiments for heavy-fermion compounds, the superconducting\ntransition occurs after the formation of the coherent quasi-particle state with heavy effective mass. Here\nwe formulate a way to calculate Tc on the quasi-particle description based on the Fermi-liquid theory.\nLet us start our discussion on the periodic Anderson model (PAM) as a typical model for heavy-fermion\nsystems. This model well describes the dual nature of f -electron systems. The perturbation expansion\nin terms of the hybridization matrix element leads to the RKKY interaction between the localized f electron spins. This is the origin of the magnetic transition in f -electron systems. On the other hand,\nif no magnetic transition occurs, the system goes to a singlet ground state as the whole. This is the\nFermi-liquid state of quasi-particles with heavy effective mass. In this case, we should treat the PAM by\nthe perturbation theory with respect to the on-site Coulomb repulsion U between f electrons, expecting\nthe analyticity about U as long as no phase transition occurs. The analytic property has been exactly\nproved in the impurity Anderson model [ 502, 503, 504, 505]. Although such an exact proof does not exist\nfor the PAM, the continuity principle is believed to justify the applicability of the perturbation theory\nwith respect to U .\nFrom such a point of view, Yamada and Yosida have developed the Fermi-liquid theory for the heavyfermion state based on the PAM [ 506]. The momentum independent part of the four-point vertex\n\u2032\nfunctions \u0393loc\n\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 between f electrons with spin \u03c3 and \u03c3 plays an important role. This dominant s-wave\nscattering part leads to the nearly momentum independent large mass enhancement factor \u03b3\u0303 = a\u22121 .\n\n\f84\nIn fact, when the momentum dependence of the mass enhancement factor can be ignored, the T -linear\ncoefficient of the specific heat in the PAM, is given by\n2\n\n2 f\nloc\n2 f\n\u03b3 \u2243 (2/3)\u03c0 2 kB\n\u03c1 (0) \u0393\u2191\u2193\n= (2/3)\u03c0 2 kB\n\u03c1 (0)\u03b3\u0303,\n\n(105)\n\nwhere kB is the Boltzmann's constant and \u03c1f (0) is the f -electron density of states at the Fermi level.\nloc\nThis indicates that the large mass enhancement factor \u03b3\u0303(= a\u22121 ) is represented as \u03c1f (0)\u0393\u2191\u2193\nwith use\nof the s-wave scattering part of the four-point vertex. This result implies that the interaction between\nloc\nthe quasi-particles a2 \u0393\u2191\u2193\nholds the order of magnitude of the effective band-width of quasi-particles\nf\nT0 \u2243 a/\u03c1 (0), where T0 is the characteristic energy scale of the heavy-fermion state. For T < T0 , the\nlow-energy excitation can be described by the Fermi-liquid theory.\nOn the other hand, the imaginary part of the f -electron self-energy, which is proportional to the electric\nresistivity, is given by\n2\n\nloc\nT 2,\n\u2206k = (4/3)(\u03c0\u03c1f (0))3 \u0393\u2191\u2193\n\n(106)\n2\n\nwhen the momentum dependence of the vertices can be ignored. Thus, the coefficient A of the T -term\nloc\nof the electrical resistivity is proportional to \u03b3 2 through the vertex \u0393\u2191\u2193\n. This relation A \u221d \u03b3 2 , which\nis well known as the Kadowaki-Woods' relation [ 471], holds when the momentum dependence of the\nvertices is sufficiently weak to be ignored. Note that the relation does not hold when the momentum\ndependence of the quasi-particle interaction is remarkable. The high-Tc cuprate is the typical case, as\nis explained in Sec. 4.3. In most of heavy-fermion systems, the Kadowaki-Woods' relation has been\nconfirmed, indicating that the four-point vertex function, i.e., the interaction among quasi-particles,\npossesses rather weak momentum dependence.\nThe heavy-fermion superconductivity appears under this situation for T < T0 . The large s-wave repulloc\nsive part \u0393\u2191\u2193\nprevents an appearance of the s-wave singlet superconductivity. In this case, anisotropic\npairing states such as p- or d-wave will be formed due to the remaining momentum dependence of the\nfour-point vertices in the particle-particle channel. Here we discuss such anisotropic paring on the quasiparticles.\nFirst we divide the four-point vertex function \u0393\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 (p1 , p2 ; p3 , p4 ) into the large s-wave scattering part\nloc\n\u0393\u03c3\u03c3\n\u2032 and the non-s-wave part \u2206\u0393\u03c3\u03c3 \u2032 (p1 , p2 ; p3 , p4 );\nloc\n\u0393\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 (p1 , p2 ; p3 , p4 ) = \u0393\u03c3\u03c3\n\u2032 + \u2206\u0393\u03c3\u03c3 \u2032 (p1 , p2 ; p3 , p4 ),\n\n(107)\n\nwhere p1 and p2 are the incident momenta, while p3 , p4 the outgoing. The second term \u2206\u0393\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 (p1 , p2 ; p3 , p4 )\nhas remarkable momentum dependence leading to the the anisotropic Cooper-pairing. Our purpose is to\nformulate how to calculate \u2206\u0393\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 (p1 , p2 ; p3 , p4 ) for the heavy-fermion quasi-particles, which are renorloc\nmalized by the large local part \u0393\u2191\u2193\n. Corresponding to these two terms of the vertex function, we can\nalso separate the self-energy into the local and non-local parts as\n\u03a3 (k, \u03c9) = \u03a3loc (\u03c9) + \u2206\u03a3 (k, \u03c9).\n\n(108)\n\nIn this case, the f -electron Green's function below T0 is given by\nG(k, \u03c9) =\n=\n\n1\nV2\n\nk\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03bek \u2212 \u03a3 loc (\u03c9) \u2212 \u2206\u03a3 (k, \u03c9) \u2212 \u03c9\u2212\u01eb\nk\na\n+\nG\n(\u03c9),\ninc\n\u1e7ck2\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u1ebck \u2212 \u03a3\u0303 (k, \u03c9) \u2212 \u03c9\u2212\u01eb\nk\n\n,\n(109)\n\nloc\nwhere a is the mass\n\u221a renormalization factor, \u1ebck = a(\u03bek + Re\u03a3 (0)) is the renormalized f -electron\ndispersion, \u1e7ck = aVk is the renormalized hybridization term, \u03a3\u0303 (k, \u03c9) = a\u2206\u03a3 (k, \u03c9) is the renormalized\nf -electron self-energy, and Ginc (\u03c9) denotes the momentum independent incoherent part of the Green's\nfunction. The imaginary part of \u03a3 loc in proportion to \u03c9 2 + (\u03c0T )2 can be included in the remaining\nrenormalized self-energy \u03a3\u0303 (k, \u03c9), as indicated by Hewson for the impurity Anderson model [ 507]. From\nthe Ward-Takahashi identity, we can obtain the large mass enhancement factor as\nZ\nd\u03a3loc (\u03c9)\ni\n\u22121\nloc 2\n\u03b3\u0303 = a = 1 \u2212\n=1\u2212\n\u0393\u2191\u2193\nGinc (\u03c9)d\u03c9.\n(110)\nd\u03c9\n2\n\u03c9=0\n\n\f85\n\nP\n(3)\nFigure 73. (a) The third-order self-energy \u03a3(3) (k, \u03c9) can be divided into three parts; \u03a30 = U 3 \u03c7\u03032 aG\u0303,\nP P\n(2)\n\u03a3v = 2U 2 q \u03bd (U \u03c7inc )\u03c7\u0303aG\u0303 and the remaining terms with no remarkable momentum dependence.\n(2)\n\nThe second term \u03a3v has the same momentum dependence as that in the second-order diagram in U .\n(b) The renormalized self-energy can be rewritten as the expansion with respect to the quasi-particle\n2 loc\nGreen's function G\u0303(p) and the effective s-wave interaction \u0393\u0303loc = \u0393\u0303loc\n\u2191\u2193 = a \u0393\u2191\u2193\n\nloc\nIn addition, we can set the large local vertex \u0393\u2191\u2193\nas a constant value at zero frequencies, as far as the\nloc\nworks on the\nfrequency of external lines is less than T0 . In this case, the effective on-site interaction a2 \u0393\u2191\u2193\n2 loc\nquasi-particles. In the impurity Anderson model, a \u0393\u2191\u2193 = a\u03c0\u2206 = 4TK , where \u2206 and TK are the width of\nloc\nthe virtual bound state and the Kondo temperature, respectively. Thus, we can assume that a2 \u0393\u2191\u2193\nis of\nthe order of T0 in the periodic system. This is also consistent with the above-mentioned discussion of the\nspecific-heat coefficient. It should be noted again that the renormalized s-wave interaction among quasiparticles becomes comparable with the quasi-particle band-width, while the on-site repulsion among the\nbare f -electrons is sufficiently larger than the bare f -electron band-width.\nNow we show that in the region \u03c9 \u2264 T0 , the renormalized self-energy \u03a3\u0303 (k, \u03c9) and vertex function\n\u0393\u0303\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 (p1 , p2 ; p3 , p4 ) = a2 \u2206\u0393\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 (p1 , p2 ; p3 , p4 ) can be discussed with the perturbation scheme with respect\nloc\nloc\n. First, let\n= a2 \u0393\u2191\u2193\nto the effective s-wave interaction, which is expected to be in the order of \u0393\u0303\u2191\u2193\nus consider the renormalized self-energy \u03a3\u0303 (k, \u03c9) = a\u2206\u03a3 (k, \u03c9). Because we have divided the Green's\nfunction into the two parts as aG\u0303(k, \u03c9)+ Ginc (\u03c9) in Eq. (109), we can correspondingly divide all diagrams\nin the perturbative series into diagrams with and without the remarkable momentum dependence. The\nlatter is contained in the local self-energy \u03a3loc (\u03c9). On the other hand, the former can be rewritten as\nthe expansion with respect to the effective s-wave interaction \u0393\u0303\u2191\u2193 by concentrating on diagrams with\n(3)\ntheP\nsame momentum dependence. For instance, let us consider the third-order\nP self-energy \u03a3 (k, \u03c9) =\nU 3 q \u03c7(q)2 G(k + q), as shown in Fig. 73. The particle-hole line \u03c7(q, \u03bd) = \u2212 p G(p + q)G(p) is divided\nP 2\ninto \u03c7\u0303(q, \u03bd) =\na G\u0303G\u0303 and \u03c7inc (\u03bd) including Ginc (\u03c9 \u2032 ). The former part contributes mainly for \u03bd \u2264 T0 ,\nwhile the latter does not possess remarkable momentum dependence after the p summation. Then, the\nP\n(3)\nthird-order diagram is also divided into three parts: \u03a30 = U 3 \u03c7\u03032 aG\u0303 with only the coherent part,\nP P\n(2)\n\u03a3v = 2U 2 q \u03bd (U \u03c7inc )\u03c7\u0303aG\u0303, and the remaining terms with no remarkable momentum dependence.\nThe last terms only contributes to the local self-energy. By ignoring the frequency dependence of \u03c7inc (\u03bd),\n(2)\nthe second term \u03a3v has the same momentum dependence as that in the second-order diagram in U .\nThen, one of the bare vertex U is replaced by U 2 \u03c7inc . This is one of vertex corrections for the second-order\nself-energy. Also in the higher-order diagrams, we can pick out diagrams with three lines of aG\u0303 producing\nthe same momentum dependence. We get together such terms and reduce them to a second order diagram\nwith respect to the effective coupling constant \u0393\u2191\u2193 . By counting a3 in three lines of aG\u0303(k, \u03c9) and a in\nthe definition of the renormalized self-energy, the renormalized second-order diagram \u03a3\u0303 (2) = a4 \u0393\u2191\u2193 2 G\u0303G\u0303G\u0303\ncan be regarded as the second-order diagram with respect to the effective s-wave interaction \u0393\u0303\u2191\u2193 = a2 \u0393\u2191\u2193 .\nHere we replace the effective coupling constant for each reduced diagram to be \u0393\u0303\u2191\u2193 and approximate it\nloc\nas \u0393\u0303\u2191\u2193\n. Then, we can estimate the renormalized self-energy in the same manner as explained in Sec. 3.1.\nLikewise, within the low-order diagrams, the vertex function \u0393\u0303\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 (p1 , p2 ; p3 , p4 ) can be reconstructed\nas the expansion with respect to the quasi-particle Green's function G\u0303(k, \u03c9) and the effective s-wave\nloc\ninteraction \u0393\u0303\u2191\u2193\n. Strictly speaking, in the higher order, there appear diagrams which cannot be reduced\n\n\f86\nto the expansion in this manner. For instance, higher-order vertex generally remains. Here we simply\nignore such diagrams and discuss the renormalized effective PAM. Then, we take a change of energy scale\nin the band-width and the interaction between quasi-particles. A better convergence is expected for this\nrenormalized scheme rather than the original perturbation scheme. This procedure just corresponds to\nan approximation similar to the pseudo-potential method, such as the ladder summation of the divergent\nhard-core potential in 3 He shown by Galitskii [ 508]. The concept of our scheme corresponds to that the\neffective Hamiltonian obtained by the renormalization group method can be written as the renormalized\nPAM. Then, the essential assumption is the locality of the interaction and the unimportance of the higher\norder vertex, when the renormalization is performed to the energy scale T0 . Of course, we must directly\ntreat the expansion in the bare interaction U to describe the crossover from the localized feature at\nhigh temperatures to the itinerant feature at low temperatures, which is characteristic in heavy-fermion\nsystems. This is one of the future problems.\nNext we formulate the Gor'kov equation for the SC transition on the quasi-particle description discussed\nabove. As usual, the SC transition is marked by divergence of the full vertex in the Cooper channel. This\nis determined by evaluating the linearized Dyson-Gor'kov equation (see Sec. 3.1) as\nX\n(111)\n\u0393 (2) (p, p\u2032 )|G(p\u2032 , i\u03c9n\u2032 )|2 \u2206(p\u2032 , i\u03c9n\u2032 ) = \u2206(p, i\u03c9n ),\np\u2032\n\nwhere \u2206(p, i\u03c9n ) is an anomalous self-energy and the Cooper-pairing effective interaction \u0393 (2) (p, p\u2032 ) is\nthe particle-particle irreducible vertex. This equation includes the integral of |G(p\u2032 , i\u03c9n\u2032 )|2 . The most\nimportant part of this integral comes from the part mediated by quasi-particles a2 |G\u0303(p\u2032 , i\u03c9n\u2032 )|. Thus, the\nGor'kov equation can be rewritten as\nX\na2 \u0393 (2) (p, p\u2032 )|G\u0303(p\u2032 , i\u03c9n\u2032 )|2 \u2206(p\u2032 , i\u03c9n\u2032 ) = \u2206(p, i\u03c9n ).\n(112)\np\u2032\n\nThis a2 \u0393 (2) (p, p\u2032 ) is the particle-particle irreducible vertex between quasi-particles with the external\nfrequencies smaller than T0 . As discussed above, for such a vertex, we can also apply the perturbation\nloc\nbetween quasi-particles.\nexpansion with respect to the renormalized s-wave interaction a2 \u0393\u2191\u2193\nThus, in order to treat the heavy-fermion superconductivity, we start by introducing the quasi-particle\nstate renormalized by the dominant s-wave scattering part, which itself does not yield the stable pairing\ninteraction. Then, we calculate the momentum dependent interaction between the quasi-particles, using\nthe perturbation expansion in terms of the renormalized on-site repulsion. This leads to the transition\ninto unconventional SC phases as a cooperative phenomenon of the heavy-fermion quasi-particles. Note\nthat the extension of the above procedure is straightforward, even if the AF spin fluctuation is relatively\nstrong and the effective interaction has rather strong momentum dependence as seen in a kind of Ce-based\nheavy-fermion superconductors and the cuprate superconductors. Now we can begin by the PAM and the\nHubbard model describing the quasi-particle Fermi surface. Note also that such quasi-particle description\nimplicitly includes the following two important arguments. The renormalized s-wave interaction among\nquasi-particles is expected to be moderate as compared with the quasi-particle band-width, even if the onsite repulsion among the bare f electrons is sufficiently larger than the bare f -electron band-width. The\nelectron-phonon interaction between quasi-particles is renormalized more severely, since it does not possess\nloc\nenhancement due to the vertex corrections as \u0393\u2191\u2193\n\u221d a\u22121 . Thus, the conventional superconductivity\nmediated by the electron-phonon interaction is excluded at this stage.\n5.3. Application to materials\nWe proceed to the results of the perturbation theory based on the renormalized formula in the typical\nheavy-fermion superconductors; CeCu2 X2 (X=Si and Ge), CeTIn5 (T=Co, Rh, and Ir), CeIn3 , and\nUM2 Al3 (M=Pd and Ni). It should be noted that the following calculations do not strictly obey the\nabove renormalization scheme. For instance, we do not include explicitly the contribution from the\nimaginary part of the local self-energy and the cut-off of the energy. Rather the perturbative scheme\nexplained in Sec. 3.1 will be directly applied. However, these differences do not alter the qualitative results\nsuch as the pairing symmetry of the stable state. Note also that the multi-band system is frequently\nreduced to the effective single-band model by taking into account the most important band triggering\nthe superconductivity.\n\n\f87\n\nFigure 74.

(a) and (b)\ncorrespond to light and dark hatches in (c), respectively.\n\n5.3.1. CeCu2 X2 (X=Si and Ge)\nAs introduced in Sec. 5.1, the superconductivity in CeCu2 Si2 with Tc = 0.7K locates around the\nborder with the AF phase at ambient pressure [ 6, 473]. This is also confirmed in terms of similarities\nwith the P \u2212 T phase diagram in the isostructural compound CeCu2 Ge2 [ 509] (Sec. 5.1.1). The effect\nof the dominant AF spin fluctuation has been observed as deviation from the conventional Fermi-liquid\ntheory in the physical quantities, such as the resistivity, the specific heat [ 510], and the NMR/NQR\n1/T1 [ 472, 476]. Then, the AF spin fluctuation may be responsible for the anisotropic even-parity\nsuperconductivity, which is observed in these compounds. In the spin fluctuation theory, the SC transition\ntemperature usually takes maximum value near the AF phase (see Figs. 23, 24 and 29). CePd2 Si2 and\nCeIn3 [ 460] are often cited as the typical examples. In CeCu2 X2 , however, the phase diagram is not so\nsimple. With increasing pressures, Tc displays the curious enhancement in the range of P = 2 \u223c 3GPa,\nnot the monotonic decrease. The maximum value of Tc is about 2K. Thus, there exists an optimum\ncondition, such as the band structure, for the superconductivity. It indicates that the low-lying part\nof the quantum-critical AF fluctuation is not responsible for the formation of the superconductivity, as\nindicated in CePd2 Si2 and CeIn3 [ 460]. On the other hand, recent systematic experiments on CeCu2 Ge2\nhave shown that the curious behavior seems to correspond to the peak structure of the residual resistivity\nand the drastic decrease of the T 2 -coefficient A of resistivity [ 458]. As a model involving these properties,\na new pairing mechanism mediating the critical f -valence fluctuations has been proposed [ 511]. However,\nhere we investigate which kind of anisotropic superconductivity can be stabilized in the complicated band\nstructure of CeCu2 X2 on the basis of TOP based on the quasi-particle description [ 512]. In addition, let\nus verify the validity of the simple unified view.\nThe band calculation with the linearized augmented-plane-wave (LAPW) method indicates that CeCu2 X2\nare compensated metals with large and small electron Fermi surfaces around the \u0393-point and complex\nhole Fermi surfaces mainly around the Z-point [ 513]. The band structure near these Fermi surfaces are\nwell represented by two bands, which are formed by the mixing between a quasi-2D f -band\n\u03bek = \u22122t[cos(kx ) + cos(ky )] \u2212 8tb cos(kx /2) cos(ky /2) cos(kz /2) + E0f ,\n\n(113)\n\nand a 3D conduction-band\n\u01ebk = 2tc [cos(kx ) + cos(ky ) \u2212 0.8 cos(kx ) cos(ky ) \u2212 2 cos(kx /2) cos(ky /2) cos(kz /2) \u2212 0.5].\n\n(114)\n\nHere t and tb are transfer integrals of f electrons, which are smaller than that of conduction electrons\ntc = 10t, and E0f = \u22126t is an f -electron site energy. When we choose tc = 10t = 0.025Ryd. = 0.34eV and\nthe hybridization term without momentum dependence V = 0.068eV, the band structure near the Fermi\nlevel can be almost explained except for some small Fermi surfaces as shown in Fig. 74. We consider the\nPAM with this band structure as described by\n\u0011 X\nX\nX \u0010 \u2020\nX f f\n\u2020\nni\u2191 ni\u2193 ,\n(115)\nH=\n\u01ebk c\u2020k\u03c3 ck\u03c3 +\nV fk\u03c3 ck\u03c3 + h.c. +\n\u03bek fk\u03c3\nfk\u03c3 + U\nk\u03c3\n\nk\u03c3\n\nk\u03c3\n\ni\u03c3\n\n\f88\n\nFigure 75. The zeroth-order spin susceptibilities \u03c70 (q, 0) at tb /t = 0.0, 0.3 and 0.5. The other parameters\nare the same as in Fig. 74. The peak structure around X-point is due to the nesting properties of the\nFermi surfaces. This peak structure is suppressed with increasing tb .\n\nFigure 76. Tc as a function of the f -level E0f for several values of V at U = 8t and tb = 0.0. Tc decreases\nwith increasing V , although it is almost unchanged for E0f . \u22126t. This is because f -band character\nbecomes stronger with decreasing E0f .\n\n\u2020\nwhere fk\u03c3 , ck\u03c3 (fk\u03c3\n, c\u2020k\u03c3 ) are the annihilation (creation) operators for f and conduction electrons with\nthe wave-vector k and a pseudo-spin index \u03c3. The Green's functions in the PAM are described in a 2 \u00d7 2\nmatrix form as\n\u0012 f\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u22121\nG (k) Gf c (k)\ni\u03c9n \u2212 \u03bek + \u03bc \u2212 \u03a3 N (k) V\nG(k) =\n=\n.\n(116)\nGcf (k) Gc (k)\nV\ni\u03c9n \u2212 \u01ebk + \u03bc\n\nSince the bare interaction works only between f electrons, the Dyson-Gor'kov equation for Gf (k) is the\nsame one as in single band case introduced in the previous chapters. Gc (k) does not directly contribute to\nthe equation like the p-electron Green function in the d-p model. Conduction electrons are incorporated\ninto the SC state through the hybridization with f electrons.\nWithin the simple TOP, we cannot obtain the large mass enhancement factor \u03b3\u0304, since U cannot be\nlarger than the f band-width. In CeCu2 Si2 , most parts of the large mass enhancement factor comes from\nalmost momentum independent self-energy, as indicated in the Kadowaki-Woods' relation. Thus, the\nrenormalization treatment introduced in Sec. 5.2 will be valid. In this case, the large mass enhancement\nis phenomenologically taken into account. Hereafter we consider the on-site Coulomb repulsion U as the\nrenormalized quasi-particle interaction a2 \u0393loc\n\u2191\u2193 as is discussed in Sec. 5.2.\nThe most favorable pairing state within the TOP is dx2 \u2212y2 -wave symmetry. The dominant attractive\npart originates from the RPA-type diagrams including the particle-hole bubble-type diagrams. As shown\nin Fig. 75, the bare f -electron susceptibility possesses the peak structure around (\u03c0, \u03c0, qz ) for any qz .\nThus, the AF spin fluctuation basically induces the unconventional superconductivity. Figure 76 illustrates E0f dependence of Tc . If assuming \u03b3\u0304 \u223c 10, we obtain the renormalized hopping integral t \u223c 39K,\nand the maximum value of Tc \u223c 0.06 \u00d7 39 \u223c 2.3K. This is a reasonable value. Furthermore, since pressures relatively raise up the f -level E0f and reduce the f -electron number, we can consider that Fig. 76\nshows pressure dependence of Tc . The region of E0f . \u22126t, where the hybridization dependence is weak,\n\n\f89\n\nFigure 77. Tc as a function of U for several n. For comparison, we illustrate Tc corresponding to the\ntransition temperatures of CeCoIn5 and CeIrIn5 .\n\ncorresponds to the AF phase in CeCu2 X2 . In the region of E0f & \u22126t, on the other hand, Tc shows a\nhump structure around E0f \u223c 2t. Suppression of Tc for E0f . 2t originates from the mass renormalization\nof the normal self-energy due to the relatively strong correlation, while for E0f & 2t, from the weak pairing\ninteraction due to the relatively weak correlation. This hump structure corresponds to the curious enhancement of Tc under high pressures in CeCu2 X2 . If we strictly follow the renormalization procedure in\nSec. 5.2, the most of the mass enhancement is not included in the calculated normal self-energy. In fact,\nthe renormalized quasi-particle band itself, which is phenomenologically introduced here, is sensitive to\npressures. Pressures make the mass enhancement \u03b3\u0303 smaller and the effective band-width larger. This will\nenhance the hump structure in T \u2212 E0f phase diagram illustrated in Fig. 76. Thus, pressure dependence\nof Tc in CeCu2 X2 can be naturally explained by taking the mass renormalization into account.\n5.3.2. CeTIn5 (T=Co, Rh, and Ir)\nRecently, superconductivity in a series of CeTIn5 has been discovered [ 464, 465, 466]. CeRhIn5 is an\nAF state with TN = 3.8K at ambient pressure, and coexists with a SC state under pressures P > 1.5GPa.\nFor P > 1.8GPa, the AF phase vanishes and only the SC state with Tc = 2.1K appears. CeIrIn5 and\nCeCoIn5 are superconducting at ambient pressure with Tc =0.4K and 2.3K, respectively. CeCoIn5 has\nthe highest Tc among heavy-fermion superconductors discovered up to now.\nThese compounds are worthy of note, since the nature is reminiscent of the cuprates and the organic\nsuperconductors, and therefore, these compounds will bridge between our understanding of Ce-based\nheavy-fermion superconductors and that of the cuprates and organic superconductors. Such a viewpoint\nis suitable for the purpose of this review. The crystal structure of these compounds is HoCoGa5 -type\ntetragonal one with a layered structure, in which alternating layers of CeIn3 and TIn2 stack sequentially\nalong the c-axis. In the dHvA measurements, the quasi-2D Fermi surfaces consistent with the band\ncalculations have been observed [ 481, 482, 483, 484, 485]. In the SC phase, the results of the NMR/NQR\nmeasurements indicate the anisotropic even-parity pairing [ 487, 488, 489, 490, 491, 492]. In addition,\nthe dx2 \u2212y2 -wave pairing was suggested from the thermal conductivity in CeCoIn5 under the parallel\nmagnetic field [ 493]. In the normal phase, both the transport [ 465, 466] and magnetic properties\nimply the strong quasi-2D AF spin fluctuation. From the detail analysis of NMR/NQR T1 with the\napplication of SCR theory [ 8], it has been shown that these compounds locate close to the quantum\ncritical point (QCP). In particular, CeCoIn5 is considered to be just above the QCP. This is also inferred\nfrom the behavior C/T \u221d \u2212 ln T in the normal-state specific heat under the magnetic field above Hc2 [\n466, 514, 515]. The associated low-temperature entropy is consistent with the huge zero-field specific-heat\njump at Tc , \u2206C/\u03b3Tc = 4.5. Although this remarkable behavior in the specific heat has not been observed\nin the cuprates, the nature can be well understood as the Fermi-liquid state with the quasi-2D AF spin\nfluctuation. Thus, the superconductivity in these compounds should be explained on the same footing\nas that in the cuprates. We show below that x-dependence of Tc in CeIrx Co1\u2212x In5 [ 516] is consistent\nwith change of the carrier number in the main Fermi surface triggering the superconductivity, and that\nthe large enhanced value of the specific-heat jump can be explained by the strong-coupling theory of\nsuperconductivity including the quasi-2D AF spin fluctuation.\nLet us discuss the x-dependence of Tc in CeIrx Co1\u2212x In5 within TOP on the basis of the quasi-particle\ndescription [ 517]. The main part of the band structure can be approximated by the tight binding fitting\n\n\f90\n\nFigure 78. (a)1/\u03c7(Q) as a function of T /Tc and \u2206/Tc = \u03a3amax (k, \u03c0T )/Tc as a function of T /Tc . (b) The\nentropy S and (c) the specific heat C in the normal and SC states. As U/t is larger, the jump of C/T at\nTc is enhanced.\n\nin a square lattice, \u03bek = 2t(cos kx + cos ky ), which reproduces the large Fermi surface with the heaviest\ncyclotron mass [ 481, 482, 483, 484, 485]. The main Fermi surfaces in CeIrIn5 and CeCoIn5 are well\nreproduced for the electron number n=0.69 and 0.77, respectively. Thus, we consider the Hubbard model\nwith such quasi-particle band and the renormalized on-site repulsion. The resulting model is the same\none as that was discussed in Sec. 3.2.3 with t\u2032 /t = 0. We have already shown that TOP, in this case,\ngives the qualitatively same results with the spin fluctuation theory (Sec. 3.2). If using the PAM as\ndiscussed above, we may reproduce more parts of the Fermi surfaces, but here we simply consider the\nsingle-band model based upon a belief that quasi-particles on the main Fermi surface play an essential\nrole for the pair formation. Multi-band Hubbard model for f -electron systems has been studied [ 518],\nbut the multi-band effect is not discussed here.\nThe result of TOP is illustrated in Fig. 77. The third-order perturbation expansion with respect to U\nleads to the effective pairing interaction for the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave superconductivity as expected from the results\nin Sec. 3.2. Tc provides proper values for the moderate U . We see that Tc increases with approaching to\nthe half-filling. This tendency is also consistent with experimental results in CeIrx Co1\u2212x In5 [ 516].\nNext we discuss the huge enhanced value of the specific-heat jump at Tc in CeCoIn5 , by analyzing the\nsame model Hamiltonian within FLEX [ 519]. The thermodynamic potential \u03a9(T, \u03bc) in FLEX is given\nby the scheme of Baym and Kadanoff, since FLEX is a kind of the conserving approximations. Then, the\nentropy S = \u2212 (\u2202\u03a9/\u2202T )\u03bc is given by explicit derivative of \u03a9(T, \u03bc) with respect to T , since its implicit\nderivative through the self-energy vanishes owing to the stationary conditions (Eq. 6) [ 169]. As a result,\nwe obtain the entropy\n\"\n#\nT XX\n\u2202\nTr ln \u011c(k) .\n(117)\nS=\u2212\n\u2202T N\n\u03c9\nk\n\nn\n\nAfter the analytic continuation on the real axis, we obtain in the normal state\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n\u0003\n1 1 X\n\u2202f \u0002\nln GnR \u2212 ln GnA ,\nS=2\nd\u01eb\u01eb \u2212\n2\u03c0iT N\n\u2202\u01eb\n\n(118)\n\nand in the superconducting state\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n\u0003\n\u2202f \u0002\n1 1 X\nA\nln GR\nd\u01eb\u01eb \u2212\nS=\nsc \u2212 ln Gsc ,\n2\u03c0iT N\n\u2202\u01eb\n\n(119)\n\nk\n\nk\n\n2 2\nwhere GR,A\n= [\u03c9\u00b1\nZk \u2212 \u03be \u0304k2 \u2212 \u03a3a2 ]\u22121 with \u03be\u0304k = \u03bek + \u03c7 and \u03a3n (k, \u00b1\u03c9) = \u00b1\u03c9(1 \u2212 Zk ) + \u03c7. The results are\nsc\nillustrated in Fig. 78. Figure 78(a) illustrates the maximum of the anomalous self-energy \u03a3a (k, \u03c0T ) as a\nfunction of T /Tc for U/t=4.0, 4.5, and 5.0. The rapid increase of the anomalous self-energy below Tc is\nthe characteristic behavior in the strong coupling theory, which has been already obtained in the FLEX\napproximation [ 186, 187, 193]. This is because the de-pairing effect arising from the normal self-energy\nis suppressed below Tc . We can see that superconductivity becomes strong coupling, as U/t is larger\n\n\f91\n\nFigure 79. Tc /t1 as a function of the anisotropy tz . In the inset, the ratio Tc /TcRPA is illustrated. Tc in\n3D systems becomes one order smaller than that in 2D systems.\n\nand equivalently the largest \u03c7s (Q) at Q \u223c (\u03c0, \u03c0) is larger. In this case, the entropy S is evaluated as\nin Fig. 78(b). It shows the convex behavior from high temperatures, which originates from the AF spin\nfluctuation. Too small entropy below T /t = 0.005 may be due to the numerical errors. With use of the\nfitting by the polynomial function of the entropy in the vicinity of Tc , we obtain the specific heat C and\nthe enhanced jump of the specific heat \u2206C/\u03b3Tc in Fig. 78(c). As U/t is larger, Tc and \u2206C/\u03b3Tc are also\nlarger. At U/t = 5.0, Tc /t = 0.017 and \u2206C/\u03b3Tc = 4.6. It is not easy to obtain larger value than this,\nsince the system becomes the AF phase. Increase of C/T in the normal state at lower temperatures can\nbe considered as the precursor of \u2212 ln T dependence, which is predicted by the SCR theory for 2D AF\nspin fluctuations. Furthermore, if we set Tc = 0.017t as 2.3K, then t \u2243 135K and C/T just above Tc\ncorresponds to \u223c 200 mJ/mol.K2 (290 mJ/mol.K2 in the experimental data [ 466]). Since the bare t\nis expected to be 2 \u223c 3 times larger than the present value 135K, the renormalization inherent in the\nquasi-particle description is not large in this case. Thus, the anomalous behavior of the specific heat in\nCeCoIn5 can be almost explained by the quasi-2D AF spin fluctuation.\n5.3.3. CeIn3\nCeIn3 is only one heavy-fermion superconductor with the cubic symmetry. At ambient pressure, it is\nthe AF state with an ordering vector Q = (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) and TN = 10K, while at the critical pressure\nPc = 2.55GPa, it becomes superconducting with Tc \u2243 0.2K [ 460, 463]. At P = 2.65GPa, 1/T1 displays\na significant decrease below T \u2217 = 30K, and T1 T =const. below TFL = 5K, which is the typical Fermiliquid behavior. Recently, it has been confirmed that the superconductivity possesses the unconventional\nnature from no coherence peak in the 115 In-NQR measurement [ 479, 480]. We note again that the\nrelative material CeRhIn5 , which is the quasi-2D material, has relatively high Tc = 2.1K under pressure.\nThis comparison indicates that the dimensionality is one of important factors for occurrence of the\nunconventional superconductivity. Effect of dimensionality on Tc has been already discussed for the\nspin-fluctuation mediated superconductivity. Both in the phenomenological models [ 185, 520] and in\nthe microscopic calculations on the basis of FLEX [ 521, 522], it has been shown that the magnitude\nof Tc is higher in quasi-2D systems than in 3D systems. With increasing three-dimensionality on the\nenergy dispersion, the AF phase is more stabilized owing to the suppression of the fluctuation, and then\nthe SC phase shrinks. Moreover, the total weight of the spin fluctuation decreases with increasing the\nthree-dimensionality. This is a general feature of the fluctuation theory as explained in Sec. 4.2.2. Then,\nTc decreases because the pairing interaction becomes effectively weak. We consider that CeIn3 is a clear\nexample for this suppression of Tc due to the three-dimensionality. We here estimate the superconducting\nTc in cubic CeIn3 and its variation for the dimensionality within TOP [ 523]. We discuss relation between\nTc and dimensionality.\nFor simplicity, we consider the Hubbard Hamiltonian with the energy dispersion\n\u01ebk\n\n=\n+\n\n\u22122t1 (cos kx + cos ky + tz cos kz )\n\n4t2 (cos kx cos ky + tz cos ky cos kz + tz cos kz cos kx ),\n\n(120)\n\nwhere t1 and t2 denote the nearest-neighbor and the next-nearest-neighbor hopping integrals. Note that\ndimensionality is controlled by a parameter tz . The cases of tz =0 and 1 correspond to the 2D square\nlattice and the 3D cubic lattice, respectively. In order to describe the main Fermi surface with a large\n\n\f92\n\nFigure 80. (a) Tc as a function of the anisotropy tm /t at U = 7.5t. (b) and (c) illustrate, respectively, the\neigen values \u03bb of the \u00c9liashberg equation for n = 1.200 and n = 1.144 at T = 0.003t. \u2206B1g is stable in a\nwide range of tm /t, while \u22062B2u only in the vicinity of tm /t = 1. Although the region of \u22062B2u becomes\nwider as n decreases, the transition temperature is suppressed abruptly.\n\nvolume in CeIn3 , we choose t2 = \u22120.2t1 and the electron density n = 0.9 for tz = 1 [ 524]. The Fermi\nsurface possesses the nesting property, and the bare susceptibility exhibits a peak structure in the vicinity\nof Q = (0.5, 0.5, 0.5). The qualitative nature of the superconductivity is the same as in the quasi-2D\nsystems. The main pairing interaction originates from the RPA-type diagrams. The most favorable\npairing state has dx2 \u2212y2 -wave symmetry. In 3D cubic systems, this state degenerates with d3z2 \u2212r2 -wave\nsymmetry. According to the weak coupling theory, time-reversal-symmetry-breaking state, which is the\nlinear combination of the two pairing states, is expected in the SC state. However, one or another may\nbe preferred because of the feedback effect. This subject will be clarified in the NQR/NMR 1/T1 at very\nlow temperatures. The obtained Tc = 0.003t1 for the moderate value of U/W = 3/4 with the band-width\nW 3D \u2243 12t1 can explain Tc \u2243 0.2K in CeIn3 with t1 \u2243 100K. We show the role of dimensionality in\nFig. 79. It can be seen that Tc in 3D systems becomes one order smaller than that in 2D systems,\nalthough Tc in quasi-2D systems is robust for tz . 0.5. These features are consistent with the results\nin the spin fluctuation theory and with the experimental fact that Tc = 0.2K in CeIn3 and Tc = 2.1K\nin CeRhIn5 . It is generally expected that the superconducting Tc is small in 3D systems, since the\nmomentum dependence of the effective interaction is relatively weak. This is the underlying physics in\ncommon with the spin fluctuation theory.\nFinally, let us comment on the quasi-1D system. In this case, Tc for the d-wave superconductivity is\ngenerally low, because the quasi-1D momentum dependence of the effective interaction is not suitable for\nthe d-wave superconductivity and the de-pairing effect is enhanced by the nested Fermi surface. Thus, the\nquasi-2D systems like high-Tc cuprates, \u03ba-(ET)2 X and CeTIn5 are the most favorable for the appearance\nof the d-wave superconductivity.\n5.3.4. UM2 Al3 (M=Pd and Ni)\nUPd2 Al3 and UNi2 Al3 [ 452, 453] exhibit clear coexistence between an AF phase and an unconventional superconductor. UPd2 Al3 is an AF metal [ 499] and coexists with the anisotropic even-parity\nsuperconductivity below Tc = 2K [ 452, 454]. UNi2 Al3 is the SDW state with Q = (0.5 \u00b1 \u03c4, 0, 0.5)\n[ 500, 501] and coexists with the odd-parity superconductivity at Tc = 1.2K [ 453]. The AF state in\nUPd2 Al3 possesses relatively large ordered moments 0.85\u03bcB /U as compared with 0.2\u03bcB /U in UNi2 Al3 ,\nand the AF transition seems to be that of the localized f -electron system. The ordered moments are\naligned parallel to the [112\u03040] direction on the c-plane, and alternate along the c-axis with Q = (0, 0, 0.5).\nFor Tc . T \u226a TN , both systems exhibit typical behaviors of heavy-fermion systems; the large enhanced\ncoefficient of the electronic specific heat (\u03b3 = 140mJ/K2mol in UPd2 Al3 and \u03b3 = 120mJ/K2mol in\nUNi2 Al3 ) and T 2 behavior in the resistivity with the large coefficient [ 452, 453]. Thus, it has been indicated that, especially in UPd2 Al3 , two separated subsystems, a localized part leading to the magnetic\nlong-range order and an itinerant part forming the heavy-fermion state, seem to coexist in momentum\nspace [ 525, 526]. On the other hand, the inelastic peak observed in the neutron scattering measurement\nin UPd2 Al3 implies a sizable interaction between two subsystems [ 528, 529, 530]. At T =4.2K, the spectrum at the AF zone center Q = (0, 0, 0.5) exhibits a quasi-elastic peak at \u03c9 = 0 and an inelastic peak\n(magnetic exciton) at \u03c9 = 1.5meV. After the SC transition, the former peak shifts to the high-energy\n\n\f93\nside, and develops into the inelastic ('resonance') peak centered at \u03c9 = 0.4meV at T = 0.4K. This is considered as a circumstantial evidence for the scenario that the dispersive magnetic exciton by localized 5f\nelectrons is responsible for the unconventional superconductivity [ 531, 532]. This mechanism indicates\nthe horizontal line nodes on the AF zone boundary. However, it has been recently shown by Thalmeier\nthat this mechanism rather favors an odd parity state [ 533]. In addition, it is suspicious whether such\nan indirect interaction as mediated by magnetic-excitons dominates the many-body effect originating\nfrom the Coulomb repulsion between itinerant electrons. Here we consider that the Coulomb interaction\nbetween the itinerant electrons should be responsible for the pairing mechanism in this compound. In\nthis case, the band structure of the itinerant electrons is important for the superconductivity, according\nto the renormalization procedure in Sec. 5.2. In UPd2 Al3 , the dHvA effect in the AF phase is in good\nagreement with the Fermi surfaces calculated by the band calculation [ 534]. The two dominant Fermi\nsurfaces ('party hat' and 'column') with heavy cyclotron mass have quasi-2D nature to some extent.\nThese quasi-2D Fermi surfaces will prefer the vertical line node rather than the horizontal one in the SC\nstate, if their own Coulomb repulsion is a dominant interaction. This is another probable candidate for\nthe unconventional superconductivity in UPd2 Al3 . This mechanism is suitable for unified viewpoint on\nthe unconventional superconductivity in SCES as frequently stressed in this review. Here we investigate\na possible scenario for the appearance of the different SC states in UPd2 Al3 and UNi2 Al3 on the basis of\nthe above standpoint.\nWe investigate the 2D Hubbard model on an anisotropic triangular lattice, which corresponds to the\nc-plane in UPd2 Al3 and UNi2 Al3 . Note that it is essentially the same model as investigated for organic\nsuperconductors (Sec. 3.3). For simplicity, here we introduce only an anisotropy of the Fermi surfaces as\nan effect of the AF order. Then, the dispersion of the quasi-particles is represented by\n\u221a\n1\n3\nkx ) cos( ky ) \u2212 2tm cos(ky ),\n(121)\n\u01ebk = \u22124t cos(\n2\n2\nreflecting that the Brillouin zone is reduced by the AF arrangement to a c-based-center orthorhombic,\nalthough the chemical unit cell is hexagonal [ 535, 536]. Here t and tm are the nearest and next nearest\nhopping integrals, respectively. Note that the dispersion possesses the D2h symmetry for tm 6= t, while at\ntm = t, it is reduced to that of the triangular lattice with the D6h symmetry. Now we evaluate \u00c9liashberg\nequation within TOP to study stable superconducting states for the anisotropy tm /t = 0.75 \u223c 1.0, the\nelectron density n = 1.0 \u223c 1.4, and the Coulomb repulsion U/t = 3.5 \u223c 7.5. Among irreducible\nrepresentations of D2h symmetry, we investigate the following\nprobable four kinds of pairing\nsymmetry,\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1\n3\n3\n1\nexcept A1g and ones including kz -dependence: \u2206B1g = sin( 2 kx ) sin( 2 ky ), \u2206B2u = cos( 2 kx ) sin( 12 ky ),\n\u221a\n\n\u22062B2u = sin(ky ), and \u2206B3u = sin( 23 kx ) cos( 12 ky ). We have found two kinds of stable state in a finite\nrange of parameters, irrespective of n and U : One is the even-parity pairing state \u2206B1g and another is the\nodd-parity pairing state \u22062B2u . As shown in Fig. 80, the former is stable in a wide range of tm , while the\nlatter only in the vicinity of the symmetric point tm = t (D6h symmetry). Although the range of \u22062B2u\nbecomes wider as n decreases, the transition temperature is suppressed abruptly. We propose these two\nstable states as the even-parity pairing in UPd2 Al3 and the odd-parity pairing in UNi2 Al3 , respectively.\nThis proposal is consistent with a feature in each compound, because we can expect that the distortion\nfrom the D6h symmetry under the magnetic order is larger in UPd2 Al3 than in UNi2 Al3 , according to\nthe magnitude of the ordered magnetic moment. Thus, the result obtained by TOP for this simplified\nmodel can well explain the emergence of the different SC states in UPd2 Al3 and UNi2 Al3 . Note that\nthe simplification of the model is obviously hypothetical and some future works will be required. For\ninstance, the effects of the AF order, three-dimensionality, multi-band effect, and the relation with the\n'resonance' peak at Q = (0, 0, 0.5) should be investigated in more details.\n\n\f94\n6. Concluding Remarks and Discussion\nIn this review, we have discussed systems possessing the strong electron correlation. They are cuprate\nsuperconductors, organic superconductors, Sr2 RuO4 , and heavy-fermion superconductors. We have analyzed the superconductivity realized in these substances on the basis of the single- and multi-orbital\nHubbard Hamiltonian. In the single-band Hubbard Hamiltonian, the on-site electron correlation U is the\nonly many-body interaction. Although the Coulomb repulsion suppresses the s-wave superconductivity,\nit induces various types of anisotropic superconductivity through the momentum dependence of quasiparticle interaction, which originates from the many-body effect. While some inter-orbital interactions\nexist in the multi-orbital Hubbard Hamiltonian, anisotropic superconductivity is induced by essentially\nthe same mechanism, namely the momentum dependence of quasi-particle interaction.\nThis is an important understanding of the mechanism of superconductivity in strongly correlated\nelectron systems (SCES). Only the above understanding is believed to be the unified one. In other words,\nsome simplified ideas will be insufficient for the purpose to provide a unified picture. For example, the\npairing mechanism is frequently attributed to fluctuation of some order parameter. The spin fluctuation\ntheory is a typical one. While this theory has obtained great success as is reviewed in Sec. 3.2, the unified\nunderstanding cannot be derived from this theory. We can easily understand this fact from the result\non Sr2 RuO4 , where the approach from the fluctuation theory clearly fails. As is explained in Sec. 3.4,\nthe pairing mechanism of Sr2 RuO4 is appropriately clarified on the basis of the understanding proposed\nabove.\nNow we emphasize that the quasi-particle in the Fermi-liquid theory is an essentially important concept\nto describe the SCES. The basis of this fact is the continuity principle existing in the Fermi liquid. This\nwidely accepted idea not only ensures the applicability of the perturbative methods but also promises\nsome universal understandings in the SCES. While the superconducting materials in SCES frequently\nshow the non Fermi-liquid behaviors, the usefulness of the Fermi-liquid theory as a starting point is robust.\nIn the general statement, the existence of Fermi-liquid quasi-particle is justified when the damping rate\nis smaller than its energy. If we adopt the nearly anti-ferromagnetic (AF) Fermi-liquid theory, the energy\nwidth of single-particle spectrum sometimes approaches to their energies, as seen in the vicinity of hot\nspots in the under-doped cuprates (Sec. 4.3.1). However, it is still possible to consider the quasi-particle\nstates with strong damping effects. The usefulness of the approach from the Fermi-liquid theory has been\nconfirmed by the arguments on the pseudogap phenomena (Sec. 4). In the argument of the pseudogap, we\nhave calculated the normal self-energy due to superconducting (SC) fluctuations. The self-energy shows\nanomalous behaviors: The real part possesses positive slope around Fermi energy and the imaginary part\nshows a large peak around Fermi energy in its absolute value. These behaviors are in sharp contrast\nto the normal Fermi liquid. We have clarified that these anomalous behaviors of the self-energy are the\norigin of the pseudogap. Because the superconducting long-range order violates the continuity principle,\nit is natural for its precursor to destroy the picture of quasi-particles by degrees.\nOn the basis of the above standpoint, we have reviewed several topics. We have clarified the mechanism\nof superconductivity for each system with the corresponding pairing symmetry. They are the d-wave\npairing for cuprates and organic superconductors, p-wave pairing for Sr2 RuO4 , and d- or p-wave pairing\nfor heavy-fermion superconductors. These results have been obtained by solving the Dyson-Gor'kov\nequation derived by perturbation calculation or FLEX approximation.\nIn particular, we should stress that the physical properties related to the cuprate high temperature\nsuperconductivity have been explained appropriately in the normal and superconducting states. The\nhole-doped and electron-doped systems have been explained in common on the basis of the same Hubbard Hamiltonian by only adjusting the carrier number to that in real systems. Moreover, pseudogap\nphenomena have been also explained by taking the SC fluctuations into account without any other assumptions.\nIn this review we have shown the following unified view for strongly correlated electron systems:\n1. The anisotropic superconductivity in SCES originates from the momentum dependence of the\nquasi-particle interaction, stemming from the on-site Coulomb repulsion. The triplet p-wave pairing in\nSr2 RuO4 also can be explained on the basis of this unified understanding. The obtained mechanism is a\nnew one, which is different from the paramagnon mechanism. In general, the d-wave superconductivity is\nstabilized near the half-filling, while the p-wave superconductivity is stabilized apart from the half-filling.\n2. The pseudogap phenomena arise from the SC fluctuation in the quasi-two-dimensional system. In\n\n\f95\naddition to the quasi-two-dimensionality, the strong-coupling superconductivity possessing short coherence length \u03be is necessary for the appearance of the pseudogap phenomena. The SC fluctuation itself\noriginates from attractive interactions induced by AF spin fluctuation. Starting with the repulsive Hubbard Hamiltonian, we have derived the pseudogap phenomena and succeeded in explaining not only the\nsingle particle properties but also the magnetic and transport ones consistently in the pseudogap region.\nIt is important that the explanation of pseudogap is the natural extension of our theory applied to the\nother regions with different hole- and electron-dopings. A kind of resonance between quasi-particle states\nin Fermi-liquid and Cooper-pairing states give rise to the pseudogap. This is an essentially new physical phenomenon discovered in quasi-two-dimensional SCES. The pseudogap above Tc gains the energy\nwithout superconducting long-range order.\n3. Among the anomalous properties in high-Tc cuprates, we have made an important progress in the\nanalysis of transport phenomena. It is shown that the vertex correction in the linear response theory\n(Kubo formula) sometimes plays an essential role in SCES. In other words, not only the properties of quasiparticles but also those of the residual interaction is necessary to understand the transport phenomena.\nFor example, the Hall coefficient, the magnetic penetration depth, and the Nernst coefficient in high-Tc\ncuprates are the cases. This is one of the characteristic features in the SCES with significant momentum\ndependence. The seemingly anomalous behaviors in cuprates are reasonably explained on the basis of\nthe Fermi-liquid theory.\n4. To describe the superconductivity in SCES, the following renormalization procedure offers an\nimportant perspective. First we include the on-site Coulomb interaction and then, band energy and\neffective interaction are renormalized. The momentum dependence of the effective interaction between\nquasi-particles gives rise to the anisotropic superconductivity. This perspective gives the explanation\non the enhanced jump of the specific heat at Tc in heavy fermion materials. Furthermore, important\nknowledge for the superconductivity in SCES is obtained. For instance, by considering the renormalization\neffect due to electron correlation, we can show that the electron-phonon interaction is generally reduced\nby the renormalization factor z compared with the electron-electron interaction. Therefore, the s-wave\npairing is almost impossible in heavy-fermion systems. The above argument is mainly related to a strategy\nto understand the superconductivity in heavy-fermion systems. By following this strategy, we have\nanalyzed the superconductivity in the Ce-based and U-based heavy fermion superconductors. Concerning\nthe systems possessing not so heavy effective mass such as the d-electron and organic materials, we can\ntreat simultaneously both the mass enhancement and the superconductivity, as has been done in this\nreview.\n5. Recently, the higher-order correction beyond the third-order perturbation theory, which is mainly\nused in this review, has been discussed. The fourth order perturbation with respect to U has been\nperformed by Nomura and Yamada (Appendix B). It is shown that the effective interaction for d-wave\npairing converges very smoothly. The fourth-order terms considerably cancel each other and as a result,\ntheir contribution becomes small in total. The superconducting critical temperature also shows a good\nconvergence. These results qualitatively justify the understanding reviewed in Sec. 3.2. On the other hand,\nthe obtained critical temperatures for the p-wave pairing case show an oscillatory behavior with respect\nto the calculated order. This behavior originates from the oscillation in particle-particle scattering terms.\nFor the p-wave case, the correction from the particle-particle ladder diagrams induces the important\ncontribution to the quasi-particle interaction. As is well known, the particle-particle ladder terms can be\ncollected up to the infinite order to give a smooth function. It is shown that rather convergent results are\nobtained by applying this procedure. Thus, it is expected that the higher-order terms can be treated so\nas not to change the result obtained within the third-order perturbation theory. Of course, the theory to\ntreat the electron correlation in a closed form is highly desirable. The results given in Appendix B imply\na possibility to develop the theory of unconventional superconductivity in a closed form by starting with\nan appropriate renormalized form.\nNew superconducting systems are continuously found in the various systems such as heavy-fermion\nsystems. The superconductivity in heavy-fermion systems provides many interesting subjects which\ndeserve theoretical efforts. We close this review by noting that the heavy-fermion superconductivity will\nbe an important and attractive future issue.\n\n\f96\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors would like to thank E. Dagotto, K.

Fermi-liquid theory on the London constant\nAs an interesting topic, in this Appendix, we discuss the London constant in high-Tc cuprates. The\nLondon constant is described by the magnetic penetration depth as \u039b = 1/4\u03c0\u03bb2L and often described by\nthe \"superfluid density\" as ns /m\u2217 . The experimental results for high-Tc cuprates have been reviewed\nin Sec. 2.1.6. The so-called \"Uemura plot\" [ 112] has particularly stimulated interests, because the\nrelation Tc \u221d \u039b(0) indicates the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition which is established in the exactly\ntwo-dimensional system [ 382]. From this insight, the phase disordered state was proposed as a possible\npseudogap state [ 115, 377, 378]. The situation is different for the quasi-two-dimensional system where the\nlong-range order occurs at finite temperature. Actually, the characteristic behavior for the KT transition,\nsuch as the Nelson-Kosterlitz jump, is not observed experimentally. Here, we do not enter into the validity\nof the phase-only model, but focus on the microscopic origin of the doping and temperature dependence\nof \u039b.\nNot only the Uemura plot but also the doping independence of a = \u2212d\u039b/dT have attracted theoretical\ninterests. Lee and Wen have shown that the doping and temperature dependences of \u039b are explained\nby the SU(2) formulation for the t-J model [ 117]. Another understanding was proposed on the basis\nof the phenomenological description for the Fermi-liquid theory [ 118, 537]. The conventional Fermiliquid theory for the isotropic system [ 538] is not available in this case. In the following, we derive\nthe microscopic description for the anisotropic Fermi-liquid and propose an understanding based on the\nFermi-liquid theory [ 119, 120]. It is shown that the expected behaviors of the Fermi-liquid parameters\nare successfully reproduced by the FLEX approximation.\nThe Fermi-liquid description for the London constant is obtained by the Kubo formula. The superconducting (SC) state is no longer the Fermi-liquid in a strict sense. However, the description based on\nthe Bogoliubov quasi-particle is similarly possible. The London constant \u039b is obtained by subtracting\nthe paramagnetic contribution from the diamagnetic contribution. Then, the London constant is derived\nfrom the current-current correlation function and therefore described by the quasi-particles as well as\nthe quasi-particle interaction. The quasi-particle interaction is expressed by the vertex correction for the\ncorrelation function. At T = 0, the interaction between the quasi-particles is taken into account in the\nsame way as in the Drude weight [ 432, 433] and in the cyclotron resonance frequency [ 539]. This is\nnatural because the Drude weight at T =0 is equal to the London constant according to the f -sum rule.\nA careful treatment for the many-body effect is needed at finite temperature. A systematic discussion is\npresented in Refs. [ 119] and [ 120]. Hereafter, we use the mean-field theory for the superconductivity.\nWe ignore the SC fluctuation because it is not important at low temperature. In particular, it has been\nconcluded that the thermal fluctuation does not contribute to the T -linear coefficient a = \u2212\u2202\u039b/\u2202T [\n384]. While the importance of the quantum fluctuation has been pointed out [ 384], we do not take it\ninto account. The doping dependence of the quantum fluctuation cooperatively affects on the London\nconstant together with the effect discussed below.\nFrom the results in Ref. [ 119], the London coefficient is written at finite temperature as\nZ\ndSk\nv \u2217 (k)(1 \u2212 Y (kF ; T ))v\u0304\u03bd\u2217 (k; T ),\n(122)\n\u039b\u03bc\u03bd (T ) = e2\n3\nv \u2217 (k)| \u03bc\nFS 4\u03c0 |~\nR\nwhere FS dSk means the integral over the Fermi surface, \u03bc and \u03bd are the spatial indices, and Y (kF ; T )\n\n\f97\n\nFigure 81.

The notation about \u03c9-limit and k-limit follows Ref. [ 17]. The\ncurrent vertex j\u03bc\u2217 (k) in the collision-less region is usually written as\nX\nf (k, k\u2032 )\u03b4(\u03b5\u2217 (k\u2032 ))v\u03bc\u2217 (k\u2032 ).\n(125)\nj\u03bc\u2217 (k) = v\u03bc\u2217 (k) +\nk\u2032\n\nIt is easily understood that v\u0304\u03bd\u2217 (k; 0) = j\u03bd\u2217 (k) because Y (k; T = 0) = 0. Note that the current vertex j\u03bc\u2217 (k)\nis different from J\u03bc (k) in Sec. 4.3.4. The latter is defined in the hydrodynamic region.\nThe above expression for the current vertex is rewritten by more convenient form as\nj\u03bc\u2217 (k) = v\u03bc (k) + z(k)w\u03bc (k)|\u01eb=0 ,\nwhere w(k)\n~\nis obtained from the following integral equations:\nZ\ndk \u2032 I(k, k \u2032 )[G(k \u2032 )2 ]\u03c9 w(k\n~ \u2032 ),\nw(k)\n~\n= ~u(k) +\n\u2032\nk\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n\u2202\u03a3(k \u2032 )\n\u2032\ndk I(k, k \u2032 )[G(k \u2032 )2 ]\u03c9 1 \u2212\n~u(k) =\n(~v (k\u2032 ) \u2212 ~v (k)),\n\u2202\u01eb\u2032\nk\u2032\n\n(126)\n\n(127)\n(128)\n\nwhere I(k, k \u2032 ) is the irreducible four-point vertex which satisfies the relation I(k, k \u2032 ) := \u03b4\u03a3(k)/\u03b4G(k \u2032 ).\nWe can show that u\u03bc (k) = 0 and therefore j\u03bc\u2217 (k) = v\u03bc (k) in the Galilei invariant system. Thus, the\nrenormalization for the current vertex j\u03bc\u2217 (k) generally results from the Umklapp scattering.\nFinally we derive the coefficient of the T -linear term from Eqs.

If we apply the above expressions for the two-dimensional isotropic system\nwhere \u03b5\u2217 (k) = k2 /2m\u2217 , the London constant is obtained in the low-temperature region as [ 538]\n\u039b(T ) = (1 + F1s /2)\n\nn\n\u2212 (1 + F1s /2)2 \u03b1T,\nm\u2217\n\n(131)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is a factor in the order of unity. The simplified expression \u039b(0) = n/m\u2217 is obtained if F1s \u226a 1.\nIf we apply Eq. (131) to the high-Tc cuprates, the Uemura plot requires the scaling behavior m\u2217 \u221d \u03b4 \u22121\nor 1 + F1s /2 \u221d \u03b4 or n \u221d \u03b4. The first candidate clearly contradicts the ARPES measurement [ 540], where\nthe mass-renormalization does not significantly depend on the doping. The second candidate leads to the\nrelation \u2212d\u039b/dT \u221d \u03b4 2 and clearly contradicts the experimental results (see Sec. 2.1.6). Thus, we can not\nresolve the anomalous behaviors by taking account of the electron correlation on the basis of the isotropic\nFermi-liquid theory. Contrary to that, the last candidate gives an appropriate result. This observation is\nsometimes suggested as an evidence for that the under-doped cuprate is a low-carrier system. This is one\nof the reasons why the NSR theory has been applied to the pseudogap phenomena (Sec. 4.1). However,\nthis argument is too naive, because the appearance of the particle number n is an accidental result in the\nisotropic case. That is, the relation \u039b \u221d n is derived from the replacement n = kF2 /2\u03c0 which is justified\nonly in the isotropic case. From the expressions Eqs. (122)-(130), the London constant is generally\ndetermined by the quasi-particles near the Fermi surface. The excitation deeply below the Fermi level is\nnot important. The similar observation has been obtained for the Hall coefficient (Sec. 4.3.4).\n\n\f99\n\nFigure 84. The doping dependence of the current vertex jx\u2217 (k) obtained by the FLEX approximation.\nThe horizontal axis represents the momentum along the Fermi surface (see Fig. 82).\n\nIn the following, we show that the generalized Fermi-liquid theory resolves the anomalous behaviors.\nThe Hubbard model is adopted as a microscopic Hamiltonian. We start from the usual case where\nthe momentum dependence of the quasi-particle interaction is not essential. The over-doped cuprate is\nprobably included in this case. Then, the current vertex is given as\nj\u03bc\u2217 (k) \u2243 v\u03bc\u2217 (k) \u2243 z(k)v\u03bc (k).\n\n(132)\n\nThus, the London constant is reduced by the renormalization factor z(k). If the momentum dependence\nof the velocity |~v \u2217 (k)| is not so significant, the conventional behavior is expected for the London constant.\nIn order to study this case, namely, the over-doped region, we use the perturbation theory. This choice\nis in common with the discussion on the pairing mechanism (Sec. 3.2). In this case, the momentum\ndependence of the quasi-particle interaction exists, but is not strong. Figure 81 shows the results of the\nself-consistent second-order perturbation. It is shown that the London constant at T = 0 decreases with\ndoping. This is an observed behavior in the over-doped region [ 114]. We see that the vertex correction\n(quasi-particle interaction) is not important.\nNote that the above situation is irrelevant in the under-doped region, because the strong momentum\ndependence is an important property of the under-doped cuprates (see Sec. 4.3). Here, the most effective\nmomentum dependence should be derived from AF spin fluctuations. If we use the phenomenological\ndescription for the quasi-particle interaction, which is represented by the Feynmann diagram in Fig. 15,\na rough estimation [ 120] shows that the current vertex behaves as in the schematic figure (see Fig. 82).\nThe current vertex is significantly reduced by the quasi-particle interaction f (k, k\u2032 ) which is enhanced\naround k = k\u2032 + Q. The reduction is especially significant around the \"hot spot\".\nFigure 82 indicates that the London constant at T = 0 decreases with the development of the spin\nfluctuation. On the other hand, the coefficient of the T -linear term a is not so doping-dependent because\nthe \"cold spot\" is not directly affected by the AF spin fluctuation at q = Q. These behaviors are\nexpected in the phenomenological proposal on this subject [ 118, 537], while the origin of the quasiparticle interaction has not been identified there. Note here that the Fermi-liquid parameter assumed in\nRef. [ 537] is qualitatively different from that in our microscopic treatment.\nThe FLEX approximation well reproduces the above estimation for the current vertex and the London\nconstant [ 120]. Figure 83 shows that the London constant at T = 0 decreases in the under-doped region\nlike the Uemura plot. The development of the AF spin fluctuation is essential for this behavior. Note\nthat the quasi-particle interaction f (k, k\u2032 ) derived from I(k, k \u2032 ) is related with the real part of the spin\nsusceptibility, while the imaginary part is important in the hydrodynamic response (Sec. 4.3.4). Therefore,\nthe vertex correction arising from the AF spin fluctuation is not so suppressed by the excitation gap.\nIf we neglect the quasi-particle interaction, qualitatively different doping dependence is obtained. We\nconclude that the Fermi-liquid correction in the nearly AF Fermi-liquid is essential for the Uemura plot.\nFigure 84 shows that the current vertex around the gap node is almost independent of the doping\nconcentration. Thus, the Fermi-liquid correction is not important for the doping dependence of a. We\nstress that this result is in sharp contrast to Eq. (131). The detailed information of the SC gap is\nneeded for the explicit estimation of a. The deformation of the gap function \u2206(k), which is observed\nexperimentally [ 224], may play a role to explain the doping independence of a. This tendency is consistent\n\n\f100\n\nFigure 85. The fourth-order diagrams for the effective pairing interaction. The vertex points and the\nsolid lines represent the bare interaction U and the bare Green's function G(0) (k), respectively.\n\nwith the FLEX approximation (Fig. 22). We consider, however, that the essential origin of the doping\nindependence of a is not this deformation but also the character of the Fermi-liquid correction.\nThus, the anomalous behaviors of the London constant are explained on the basis of the general\nformulation for the Fermi-liquid theory. The vertex correction arising from the AF spin fluctuation\nplays an essential role, as in the hydrodynamic transport in the normal state (Sec. 4.3.4). These results\nexcellently contribute to the coherent understanding of high-Tc cuprates.\nSo far, we have used the two-dimensional model and discussed the in-plane transport. We briefly\ncomment on the qualitatively different behavior of the c-axis London constant \u039bc [ 113, 116]. Owing to\nthe the momentum dependence of the inter-layer hopping (see Eq. (103)), the coherent transport gives\nthe T 5 -law of \u039bc in the clean limit [ 541]. However, the power is easily affected by the randomness and\nthen, the incoherent nature should be taken in the under-doped region. The lower power is observed in\nmany cases [ 541]. The Fermi-liquid correction is probably not important for the c-axis London constant,\nbecause the kz -dependence of the quasi-particle interaction is very weak.\nContrary to the above discussion on the low-temperature behaviors, the temperature dependence\naround Tc is dominated by the SC fluctuation. The critical fluctuation generates the rapid growth of the\nLondon constant, which is more remarkable along the c-axis [ 383]. These behaviors are also observed in\nthe experimental result which has indicated the scaling behavior corresponding to the universality class\nof the 3D XY model [ 121].\nB. Effects of higher-order perturbation terms\nIn Sec. 3.1, we have provided the perturbation expansion for the effective pairing interaction or the\nanomalous self-energy up to third order of the on-site Coulomb repulsion U . However, the value of\nU leading to the realistic Tc is not always sufficiently small compared with the kinetic energy of the\nsystem. Thus, the convergence of the perturbation expansion should be examined. Furthermore, it is\ninteresting to investigate the momentum dependence of the higher-order perturbation terms, since the\nmomentum dependence of the effective interaction among quasi-particles is important for unconventional\nsuperconductivity in SCES. For these problems, recently two of the present authors, Nomura and Yamada,\nhave performed the fourth-order expansion for the pairing interaction and investigated the momentum\ndependence of fourth-order contributions [ 542]. In this Appendix, following their work, we briefly discuss\nthe effects of the higher-order terms.\nNomura and Yamada have considered two typical cases in the two-dimensional Hubbard model on the\nsquare lattice, given by Eqs. (42) and (43) in Sec. 3.2.3: One is the case (I) similar to the high-Tc cuprates,\nwhere the system is near the half-filling and AF spin fluctuations are strong due to the Fermi surface\nnesting. Another is the case (II) similar to the \u03b3 band in the spin-triplet superconductor Sr2 RuO4 , where\nthe system is away from the half-filling. In the both cases, the Fermi level is set close to the van Hove\nsingularity.\nNote here that the higher-order expansions have been carried out by Efremov et al. for a fermion gas\nmodel with repulsive interaction in the isotropic three-dimensional space [ 543]. They have evaluated\nthe effective interactions perturbatively up to the fourth order with respect to the s-wave scattering\ncomponent of the bare interaction. Their discussions are applicable to the diluted liquid 3 He.\n\n\f101\nThe irreducible vertex function V\u03c31 \u03c32 ,\u03c33 \u03c34 (k, k \u2032 ) is expanded in terms of U as\nV\u03c31 \u03c32 ,\u03c33 \u03c34 (k, k \u2032 ) =\n\n(k, k \u2032 )U 3\n(k, k \u2032 )U 2 + V\u03c3(3)\n(k, k \u2032 )U + V\u03c3(2)\nV\u03c3(1)\n1 \u03c32 ,\u03c33 \u03c34\n1 \u03c32 ,\u03c33 \u03c34\n1 \u03c32 ,\u03c33 \u03c34\n(k, k \u2032 )U 4 + * * * .\n+V\u03c3(4)\n1 \u03c32 ,\u03c33 \u03c34\n\n(133)\n\nThen, we define the following quantities:\n(k, k \u2032 )U 2 ,\n(k, k \u2032 )U + V\u03c3(2)\n(k, k \u2032 ) = V\u03c3(1)\nV\u03c3(\u22642)\n1 \u03c32 ,\u03c33 \u03c34\n1 \u03c32 ,\u03c33 \u03c34\n1 \u03c32 ,\u03c33 \u03c34\n\n(134)\n\n(k, k \u2032 )U 3 ,\nV\u03c3(3)\n1 \u03c32 ,\u03c33 \u03c34\n\n(135)\n\n(k, k \u2032 )U 4 .\n(k, k \u2032 ) + V\u03c3(4)\n(k, k \u2032 ) = V\u03c3(\u22643)\nV\u03c3(\u22644)\n1 \u03c32 ,\u03c33 \u03c34\n1 \u03c32 ,\u03c33 \u03c34\n1 \u03c32 ,\u03c33 \u03c34\n\n(136)\n\n(k, k \u2032 )\nV\u03c3(\u22643)\n1 \u03c32 ,\u03c33 \u03c34\n\n=\n\n(k, k \u2032 )\nV\u03c3(\u22642)\n1 \u03c32 ,\u03c33 \u03c34\n\n+\n\nThese functions are used as perturbative approximate forms for the effective pairing interaction V\u03c31 \u03c32 ,\u03c33 \u03c34 (k, k \u2032 ).\n(\u22643)\nNote that in the Sec. 3, we have taken V\u03c31 \u03c32 ,\u03c33 \u03c34 (k, k \u2032 ) as the approximate form.\nThe diagrammatic expressions for the fourth-order perturbation terms are shown in Fig. 85. The\nanalytic expressions for the diagrams are found in Ref. [ 542] (see also Ref. [ 543]). Since the weak\ncoupling region is considered here, the normal self-energy is simply ignored and the bare Green's function\nG(0) (k) is assigned to the internal lines in Fig. 85. When we include the normal self-energy correction\nin the internal lines, the transition temperature should be decreased due to the increase of quasi-particle\ndamping. However, the momentum dependence of the effective pairing interaction would not be affected\nat least qualitatively and thus, the most probable pairing symmetry would not be changed.\nNow all fourth-order terms are at our hands, but unfortunately, it is not feasible task to perform\nfaithfully the summation in momentum and frequency for the fourth-order terms. Up to the third order,\nwe could carry out the summation numerically both in momentum and frequency by exploiting the fast\nFourier transformation (FFT) algorithm, but the fourth-order terms include contributions which cannot\nbe summed up in the same manner. In order to proceed to further calculations, we consider the momentum\ndependence only on the Fermi surface for V\u03c31 \u03c32 ,\u03c33 \u03c34 (k, k \u2032 ) and the anomalous self-energy \u2206(k). This\nsimplification is justified as far as we discuss low-energy phenomena including superconductivity, for\nwhich the quasi-particles in the vicinity of the Fermi level play the most important roles. We define NF\npoints, kFi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 NF ), on the Fermi circle. Then, the effective interaction V (kF , kF\u2032 ) and the gap\nfunction \u2206(kF ) are expressed as functions of the positions kF and kF\u2032 on the Fermi surface. By fixing\nmomenta kF and kF\u2032 on the Fermi surface, we can numerically perform the summation with respect to\nthe internal momenta and frequencies up to the fourth order with the use of FFT algorithm. The above\nsimplification is summarized as follows:\nV\u03c31 \u03c32 ,\u03c33 \u03c34 (k, k \u2032 ) \u2192 V\u03c31 \u03c32 ,\u03c33 \u03c34 (k, k\u2032 ) \u2261\n(k, k\u2032 ) \u2261\n(k, k \u2032 ) \u2192 V\u03c3(p)\nV\u03c3(p)\n1 \u03c32 ,\u03c33 \u03c34\n1 \u03c32 ,\u03c33 \u03c34\n\u2206\u03c31 \u03c32 (k) \u2192 \u2206\u03c31 \u03c32 (k),\n\nlim\n\nV\u03c31 \u03c32 ,\u03c33 \u03c34 (k = (k, i\u03c9), k \u2032 = (k\u2032 , i\u03c9 \u2032 ))\n\n(137)\n\nlim\n\n(k = (k, i\u03c9), k \u2032 = (k\u2032 , i\u03c9 \u2032 ))\nV\u03c3(p)\n1 \u03c32 ,\u03c33 \u03c34\n\n(138)\n\n\u03c9=\u03c9 \u2032 \u2192+0\n\u03c9=\u03c9 \u2032 \u2192+0\n\n(139)\n\nwhere p symbolically denotes p=\u2264 2, \u2264 3, \u2264 4, ... etc. The quantity V\u03c31 \u03c32 ,\u03c33 \u03c34 (k, k\u2032 ) is regarded as\nthe scattering amplitude in the pair scattering process, where the two electrons (or Fermi-liquid quasiparticles) with the momenta and spins, (k, \u03c31 ) and (\u2212k, \u03c32 ), are scattered to the states characterized by\nthe momenta and spins, (k\u2032 , \u03c34 ) and (\u2212k\u2032 , \u03c33 ), respectively. As a result of the simplification for Eq.

LF is the circumference of the Fermi circle, W is the cut-off energy,\nand \u03b3(= 0.5772 * * * ) is the Euler's constant. The cut-off energy is taken as W = 0.700 throughout the\n\n\f102\n\nFigure 86. (a) Fermi surface for the nearly half-filled case (I).

The symmetry is dx2 \u2212y2 -wave state for all cases. The parameters are T = 0.0100 and U = 2.066.\n\nFigure 87. Transition temperature as a function of the repulsion U for the nearly half-filled case (I). The\nmost probable pairing state is spin-singlet dx2 \u2212y2 -wave.\n\npresent calculation. We can determine the transition temperature at which the maximum eigenvalue \u03bbmax\nis equal to unity and the eigenfunction giving \u03bbmax is related to the most probable pairing symmetry.\nDetails of the formulation are given in Ref. [ 542].\nNow we show the numerical results of the gap function \u2206\u03c31 \u03c32 (k) and the transition temperatures as\nfunctions of the repulsion U . For the case (I), we have taken the hopping parameters t = 1.00 and\nt\u2032 = \u22120.100 and set the electron number as n = 0.98. The Fermi surface is depicted in Fig. 86(a). The\nobtained gap function \u2206\u03c31 \u03c32 (k) exhibits the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave state in all the cases of the second-, third-, and\nfourth-order perturbation theories. This may be natural if we recall that the momentum dependence of\nthe pairing interaction is well approximated by using the susceptibility as g 2 \u03c7(k \u2212 k \u2032 ) in Sec. 3.2.2 for\nthe superconductivity induced by the strong anti-ferromagnetic spin fluctuations.\nWe show the transition temperatures as functions of the repulsion U for the case (I) within the second-,\nthird-, and fourth-order perturbation theories in Fig. 87. The values of Tc for the third- and fourth-order\ntheories are quantitatively close to each other, although Tc for the second-order theory is very low. If we\nfurther take account of the perturbation terms beyond fourth order, the curve of Tc as a function of U\nis considered to converge to a single curve, leading to a better estimation for Tc than that of the present\nfourth-order calculation.\nLet us discuss the validity of the perturbation expansion by comparing the magnitude of the third- and\nthe fourth-order vertex functions, V (3) (k, k\u2032 ) and V (4) (k, k\u2032 ). This naive analysis justifies the expansion\nin U up to U \u223c |V (3) /V (4) | \u223c 3.5 [ 542]. Although there are much more perturbation terms in the fourth\norder than in the second or third order, most of the fourth-order contributions cancel each other, and\ntherefore the total magnitude of V (4) (k, k\u2032 ) is smaller than that of V (3) (k, k\u2032 ). Thus, the convergence\nof the perturbation expansion in U becomes good up to moderately strong U within the fourth-order\nperturbation theory. In addition, the momentum dependences of the functions, V (2) (k, k\u2032 ), V (3) (k, k\u2032 ),\nand V (4) (k, k\u2032 ) are all similar to each other. Therefore the perturbation expansion would give a good\nestimation of the effective pairing interaction and a reasonable analysis of the pairing symmetry up to\n\n\f103\n\nFigure 88. The strong contributions with particle-particle ladder in the vertex. The contributions enclosed\nby the dotted lines are added to V (\u22644) (k, k \u2032 ) in order to suppress ill-convergence.\n\nFigure 89. (a) Fermi surface for the case (II) away from the half-filled. (b) The gap function \u2206triplet (kF )\nas a function of the position kF on the Fermi circle. Note that kF traces the Fermi circle following the\narrows in (a). The parameters are T = 0.0100, U = 3.428.\n\nmoderately strong U in this case.\nNext we consider the other case (II). According to the recent work [ 542], the convergence of the\nperturbation expansion is not good for the spin-triplet channel, in contrast to the spin-singlet channel\nnear the half-filled case (I). In one word, this is due to an oscillatory behavior in terms of U . As shown in\nSec. 3.4.2, the third-order terms give the momentum dependence much favorable for the p-wave pairing.\nAfter the momentum dependences of all fourth-order terms are examined, it is found that dominant\ncontributions have the momentum dependence similar to that of the third-order term, but their signs are\nopposite. Further analysis on higher-order terms has revealed that the contributions shown in Fig. 88\nprovide the dominant momentum dependence in each order. These contributions in each higher-order\nterm have positive (negative) sign for odd (even) order of U and thus, these contributions can be summed\nup to the infinite order. For the pairing interaction, then we use V (\u22644 corr.) (k, k \u2032 ), which is obtained by\nadding the higher-order corrections shown in Fig. 88 to V (\u22644) (k, k \u2032 ). Due to this improved procedure,\nthe most probable pairing symmetry is triplet p-wave.\nIn Fig. 89, we show the Fermi surface and the gap function for the case (II), where we have taken\nthe hopping parameters t = 1.00 and t\u2032 = \u22120.375 and set the electron number as n = 1.334. The\ngap functions obtained for the third-order and the above mentioned improved fourth-order perturbation\ntheories show the highly anisotropic p-wave symmetry with the nodes on the line ky =0, while the gap\nfunction obtained in the second-order theory has eight additional nodes on the Fermi surface. We show the\ntransition temperature as functions of the repulsion U in Fig. 90. Note that the second-order perturbation\ntheory gives only low Tc , because the momentum dependence of the effective interaction V (\u22642) (k, k\u2032 ) is\nless favorable for the triplet p-wave pairing than V (\u22643) (k, k\u2032 ) and V (\u22644 corr.) (k, k\u2032 ).\nFinally we again emphasize that the momentum dependence induced by the electron correlations is\nimportant for the anisotropic pairing in SCES. In some cases, the picture that some magnetic fluctuations\ninduce the anisotropic superconductivity would be valid. However, we could not always consider that\nthe essential momentum dependence of the pairing interaction originates from some strong fluctuations.\n\n\f104\n\nFigure 90. Transition temperature as a function of the repulsion U for the case (II). The most probable\npairing state is spin-triplet p-wave pairing state.\n\nThe most essential point for anisotropic pairings is what momentum dependence the effective pairing\ninteraction could acquire as a result of many-body effects or correlation effects, as we have stressed\nthroughout this review article. In general, we could expect that the perturbation theories developed in\nthis review capture qualitatively well the essential momentum dependences of the pairing interaction.\nIt is highly believed that the anisotropic pairing deduced within the weak-coupling perturbation theory\nevolves smoothly up to the realistically strong U .\n\n\f105\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.
