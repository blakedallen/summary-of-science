We present a simple framework that couples higher\nspins to a broad class of gravitational backgrounds (including Ricci\nflat and Einstein) consistently at the classical level. The model is the\nsimplest example of a Yang\u2013Mills detour complex, which recently has\nbeen applied in the mathematical setting of conformal geometry. An\nanalysis of asymptotic scattering states about the trivial field theory\nvacuum in the simplest version of the theory yields a rich spectrum\nmarred by negative norm excitations. The result is a theory of a\nphysical massless graviton, scalar field, and massive vector along with\na degenerate pair of zero norm photon excitations. Coherent states\nof the unstable sector of the model do have positive norms, but their\nevolution is no longer unitary and their amplitudes grow with time.\nThe model is of considerable interest for braneworld scenarios and\nghost condensation models, and invariant theory.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nMassless, massive, and partially massless free higher spin fields propagate\nconsistently in maximally symmetric backgrounds (i.e., Minkowski, de Sitter\nand Anti de Sitter spaces) [1, 2, 3]. Allowing generic curved backgrounds\nintroduces various inconsistencies. Firstly, introducing general curvatures\nR\u03bc\u03bd # = [D\u03bc , D\u03bd ] can destroy the gauge invariances or constraints which ensured the correct physical degree of freedom count of maximally symmetric\nbackgrounds [4, 5]. Secondly, even in benign backgrounds ensuring correct\ndegrees of freedom, signals may propagate at superluminal speeds [6, 7] In\nthis Article we display a simple mechanism for maintaining the gauge invariances of higher spins in a broad class of gravitational backgrounds.\nMuch mathematical insight into the structure of manifolds has been\ngained by studying the equations of mathematical physics. Notable examples\ninclude the self-dual Yang\u2013Mills equations and Donaldson's four manifold\ntheory, and ensuing simplifications based on the monopole equations of its\nsupersymmetrization [8]. In self-dual Yang-Mills theory an important r\u00f4le\nis played by a class of two operator complexes that are sometimes termed\nYang-Mills complexes. In [9] it is observed that there is a closely related 3 operator complex for each full Yang-Mills connection. These are there termed\nYang-Mills detour complexes since there are intimate links with conformal\ngeometry and in dimension four the complexes fall into a class of complexes\ncalled conformal detour complexes [10]. The Yang-Mills detour complexes\nare related to an idea that has been extant in the Physics literature for some\ntime. Namely, it is well known that massless vectors couple consistently to\nan onshell Yang\u2013Mills background if a non-minimal coupling is included [11].\nUnwrapping this in mathematical terms yields a Yang-Mills detour complex.\nHere we propose to study a Yang-Mills detour complex in one of the simplest\npossible settings in order to expose and explore, for a physics audience, the\nissues of consistency at both the classical and quantum level. On a dimension 4 Lorentzian background we obtain a theory of higher spins by taking\nthe Poincar\u00e9 group as Yang\u2013Mills gauge group and the vectors transforming\nin any finite dimensional representation.\nThe first objection, that this simple model mixes spacetime and internal\nsymmetries, and so violates the Coleman\u2013Mandula theorem [12], is evaded\nbecause we propose only a theory of non-interacting free fields whereas the\ntheorem pertains to triviality of an interacting S-matrix. The second complaint that finite dimensional representations of the non-compact Poincar\u00e9\n2\n\n\fgroup are non-unitary and therefore imply the likelihood of ghost states is,\nhowever borne out. (We note that an infinite dimensional unitary representation ought yield an infinite tower of consistent higher spin interactions and\ncomment further in the Conclusions.) In the trivial field theory vacuum we\nindeed find a pair of degenerate, zero norm photons. Nonetheless, the model\nis of considerable interest because\n1. Ghost states can simply indicate instability of the trivial Lorentz invariant vacuum. The model is useful as both a laboratory to study\nthese excitations plus there exists the possibility of finding a (possibly\nnon-Lorentz invariant) stable vacuum (especially if interactions were\nincluded).\n2. The model can be used to study properties of the background manifold\nin which the higher spin fields propagate. Higher spin gauge invariances\ncan provide new invariants of the background manifold [13]. Moreover,\nfinding physical states amounts to computing the cohomology of the\ntwisted Maxwell complex.\n3. Backgrounds other than the simplest Minkowski one, may permit a\nphysical scattering spectrum.\nFor the simplest non-trivial spin 2 example in a four dimensional Minkowski\nbackground we find the following spectrum1 :\nSpin\n2\n1\n1\n1\n0\n\nMass\n\u221a0\n2m\n0\n0\n0\n\nNorm\n+ve\n+ve\n0\n0\n+ve\n\nThe Lorentz invariant Lagrangian for these excitations depends on (i) a\n2-index symmetric tensor, (ii) a 2-form, and (iii) a vector field. However a\ndetailed Hamiltonian helicity analysis is required to determine the graviton,\nmassive vector, two photon, and massless scalar spectrum quoted above. Interestingly, the photon states correspond to generalized eigenvector solutions\n1\n\nFor flat backgrounds, the mass parameter m is freely tunable (save to vanishing values). In general spaces it depends on the gravitational coupling. A parameter space study\nas in [7] is then required.\n\n3\n\n\fof the wave equations of motion. Physically this amounts to resonance states\nwith amplitudes growing linearly in time. Moreover, in the unstable photon\nsubspace of the Hilbert space, only zero norm states diagonalize the Hamiltonian. Coherent states of these photon excitations have norms which grow\nwith time, in violation of unitarity, and signify the instability of the model.\nThis Article is arranged as follows. In Section 2 we explain how to formulate higher spins as a complex and present the twisted Maxwell complex. In\nSection 3 we specialize the underlying vector matter fields to the fundamental representation of the Poincar\u00e9 Yang\u2013Mills gauge group. The Hamiltonian\nanalysis of this model is given in Section 4 while Section 5 concentrates on the\ndangerous helicity one excitations. The quantization of the model is given in\nSection 6. In Section 7 we compute coherent states and their evolution. Our\nconclusions and further speculations are given in Section 8.\n\n2\n\nYang\u2013Mills Detour Complex\n\nAn obvious, yet powerful, observation is that in any dimension we can view\na classically consistent higher spin gauge theory as a complex\n\u001b\n\u001b \u2217 \u001a\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u001a\nG\nD Bianchi\nD\nField\nGauge\n0 \u2212\u2192 Parameters \u2212\u2192 {Fields} \u2212\u2192 Equations \u2212\u2192 Identities \u2212\u2192 0 .\n\n(1)\nHere where we write \"Field Equations\" is really of course the vector bundle where these equations take values and a similar comment applies to the\n\"Bianchi Identities\" which give the integrability condition for the field equations. The simplest example is the Maxwell (detour) complex where the space\nof fields are one forms V \u2208 \u0393(\u039b1 M), and D = d the Poincar\u00e9 differential, its\ndual is \u2217 D = \u2217d\u2217 and Maxwell's equations are simply\nGV \u2261 \u03b4dV = 0 .\n\n(2)\n\nIn this case the statement that (1) is a complex so that G D = 0 = \u2217 D G\namounts to the gauge invariance V \u2192 V + d\u03b1 and the Bianchi identity\n\u03b4 GV = 0.\nThe Maxwell complex can be twisted by coupling to a vector bundle\nconnection over the manifold M. In general then (1) fails to be a complex\nreflecting the usual problem of adding curvature to a flat theory. However,\nif the connection satisfies the Yang-Mills equations then remarkably it turns\n4\n\n\fout that we still obtain a complex called a Yang\u2013Mills detour complex [9] .\nLet us review, in our current notation and on a spacetime background, this\nsimple construction. In this setting, the space of fields are one-forms taking\nvalues in a representation R of the Yang-Mills gauge group G. We work\nlocally, so for the purposes of the calculations the manifold may be taken to\nbe R4 and the bundle carrying the representation may be taken trivial (as a\nvector bundle). Let\nD = d + A,\n(3)\nbe the Yang\u2013Mills connection (so the Yang\u2013Mills potential A is a g-valued\none-form). Then we set\n\n\u2217\n\nD = D,\nD = \u2217 D\u2217 ,\nG = \u2217 D \u2217 D \u2212 \u2217(\u2217 F ) ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere F = D 2 is the Yang\u2013Mills curvature. Now we find that (1) is a complex\nso long as the Yang\u2013Mills connection obeys the Yang\u2013Mills equations\n[D, \u2217F ] = 0 .\n\n(5)\n\nPhysicists would summarize this information in terms of the action (valid in\nany spacetime dimension and signature)\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\nS=\nV\u03bcT g \u03bc\u03bd D \u03c1 D\u03c1 \u2212 D \u03bd D \u03bc + F \u03bc\u03bd V\u03bd ,\n(6)\n2 M\nwith gauge invariance V\u03bc \u2192 V\u03bc +D\u03bc \u03b1 valid whenever D \u03bc F\u03bc\u03bd = 0 (suppressing\nindices corresponding to the representation R).\nThe existence and origin of this model is also clear from a physical standpoint. Yang-Mills theory itself can be constructed iteratively by coupling\nvectors to vectors [11]. The first step of coupling abelian vector fields V to\nthe non-abelian vector field A requires that the field A is on-shell.\nThe model (6) is a consistent one for any compact gauge group G and\nunitary representation R. Our proposal is simply to relax compactness of G\nand take it to be the spacetime Poincar\u00e9 symmetry algebra, and to begin our\nstudy with finite dimensional representations R. The ghost difficulties that\nthe model faces are all hidden in the superscript \"T \" on the field V\u03bc in (6),\nindicating an inner product on vectors in the representation space R.\n5\n\n\fNonetheless, the proposal is rather fruitful since taking the gauge group G\nto be the Poincar\u00e9 one amounts to coupling the model to gravity. This idea is\nwell known both in mathematics and physics (called the Cartan connection\nor Palatini formalism, respectively). Let us concentrate on four dimensions\nand adopt the 5\u00d75 matrix representation of the Poincar\u00e9 Lie algebra so that\nthe background Yang\u2013Mills potential reads\n\u0013\n\u0012 m\n\u03c9 n em\n,\n(7)\nA=\n0\n0\nwhere indices m, n, .. take values 0, 1, 2, 3 and are raised and lowered with\nthe flat Minkowski metric \u03b7mn = diag(\u22121, 1, 1, 1)mn . Here, we view e as the\nvierbein for the underlying spacetime and \u03c9 as the spin connection. The\nYang\u2013Mills curvature F then becomes\n\u0013\n\u0012 m\nR n Tm\n.\n(8)\nF =\n0\n0\nwhere R = d\u03c9 + \u03c9 \u2227 \u03c9 is the Riemann curvature and T = de + \u03c9 \u2227 e is\nthe torsion of the connection. We may work either with torsion-free T = 0\nspacetimes or include it according to the physics being probed. In the absence\nof torsion, the spin connection can be solved for as a function of the vierbein\nand the Yang\u2013Mills equations become the equations of harmonic curvature\nD \u03bc R\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 = 2D[\u03c1 R\u03c3]\u03bd = 0 .\n\n(9)\n\nThis requirement is weaker than Einstein's equations. Obvious solutions are\nRicci flat, Einstein and self-dual backgrounds so the model clearly has a wide\nphysical applicability.\nFinally, now that the model couples to gravitational backgrounds, we\nobtain higher spin fields by taking the vector field V to be a tensor representation of the Poincar\u00e9 group. These can be decomposed in terms of tensor\nrepresentations of the Lorentz subgroup, so generically we find theories of\nhigher spin fields (f\u03bc m1 ...ms , v\u03bc m1 ...ms\u22121 , . . . , v\u03bc ).\n\n3\n\nMinkowski Twisted Maxwell\n\nWe make two simplifications. The background space is Minkowski R3,1 and\nthe representation R is the fundamental of the Yang\u2013Mills Poincar\u00e9 gauge\n6\n\n\fgroup G = SO(3, 1) \u22ca R4 . In this case the Yang\u2013Mills curvature vanishes so\nthere no non-minimal coupling in the detour operator G. So we simply have\nwhat is known as a twisted Maxwell complex.

(This is also obvious from the standpoint of\nfive massless Yang\u2013Mills vector matter fields.) However, the partition of\nthese modes into the irreducible Poincar\u00e9 representations of Wigner [14] is\nhardly clear from the Lagrangian (12).

It is important to note\nthat this is a freedom peculiar to flat space. Upon considering more general\ncurved backgrounds, the parameter m must be tuned to the gravitational\ncoupling2 .\n\n4\n\nHamiltonian Helicity Analysis\n\nTo determine the spectrum of the model we make a Hamiltonian analysis and\nhelicity decomposition. We treat the time coordinate on a separate footing\nand denote spatial indices by i, j, k, ... = 1, 2, 3.

As we shall see in the following Section, the latter forms\nthe zero helicity component of a physical massive vector field.\n\n5\n\nHelicity 1 Hamiltonian Analysis\n\nThe helicity 1 sector is more subtle. Although classically consistent, the\nmodel displays negative norm states when expanded about the trivial Lorentz\ninvariant field theoretic background.

Observe that this mass eigenvalue agrees with\nthat found in the zero helicity sector so we obtain a pair of photons and a\nmassive vector. This is the spectrum quoted in the Introduction, we now\nanalyze its quantization and stability.\n\n6\n\nQuantization and Stability\n\nTo quantize the model we expand the on-shell fields on plane wave solutions\n\u03a6 =\n\n3\nX\n\n(fi \u03b1i\u2020 + fi \u03b1i ),\n\ni=1\n\nwhere\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\nf1 = 54 \uf8ed 1 \uf8f8 eikt ,\ni\n\n(33)\n\uf8eb\n\n1\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nf2 = f1 + ik \uf8ed 21 t \uf8f8 eikt ,\n\n(34)\n\ni\n2t\n\nare photon solutions and the massive vector solution is\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 \u221a\n\u221a\n1\n2 + 2 \uf8f7 ei k 2 +2 t .\nf3 = \uf8ec\n\u2212\ni\nk\n2\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n1\n\u22122k\n\n(35)\n\nAs we shall see, the massive vector subspace of the Hilbert space is perfectly\nphysical while the photon subspace is pathological. Already we see that the\nsolution f2 has amplitude growing linearly in time. Mathematically this is\na generalized eigenvector solution to our system of PDEs. Physically it can\nbe interpreted in terms of a resonance between highly tuned wave solutions\nand indicates an instability. Similar behavior has already been observed\nin the ghost condensation mechanism of [16] employed to obtain infra-red\nmodifications of Einstein gravity.\n12\n\n\fWe now promote the Fourier coefficients (\u03b1i , \u03b1i\u2020 ) to operators in a Fock\nspace. Positivity of the classical energy and in turn stability can be studied\nthrough the energy eigenvalues of single particle states. We will also analyze\nunitarity of the model by computing norms of quantum states.\nImposing canonical equal time commutation relations of the fields and\ntheir momenta\n[\u03a0, \u03a6t ] = \u2212i1 ,\n\n(36)\n\nfixes the commutation relations of the creation and annihilation operators to\n\uf8eb 2k\n\uf8f6\n1\n\u2212 25 \u2212 5k\n0\n\uf8ec 1\n\uf8f7\n0\n0\n\u03a9 \u2261 [\u03b1, \u03b1\u2020] = \uf8ed \u2212 5k\n(37)\n\uf8f8.\n0\n\n0\n\n\u221a1\n2 k 2 +2\n\n(the right hand side of this equation is the Wronskian of the solutions above).\nAs promised this is block diagonal and positive definite in the massive vector\nblock. The zero on the diagonal already signals the presence of zero norm\nstates in the photonic Fock space.\nThe Hamiltonian may be expressed also in terms of Fock operators as\nH = \u03b1\u2020 M\u03b1 ,\nwith matrix\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n\n\u22125k 2\n\n\uf8ec\n\u22125k 2 2k 2 (k 2 \u2212 1)\nM=\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n0\n\n0\n\n(38)\n0\n0\n2(k 2 + 2)\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8f8\n\n(39)\n\nTaking into account the normalization of the symplectic form \u03a9 we see that\nmassive vectors states have both positive norms and energies with single\nparticle, relativistic dispersion relation\n\u221a\n(40)\nE = k2 + 2 .\nThe photonic Fock space is much more subtle. Interestingly enough the\neigenvalues of the matrix M can become negative but are actually bounded\nbelow. However, consider a single particle state\n|1i = \u03b1\u2020 \u03bb|0i ,\n13\n\n(41)\n\n\fwhere |0i is the Fock vacuum and \u03bb is some constant, complex 3-vector of\ncoefficients. Requiring |1i to be an energy eigenstate implies that\nH|1i = \u03b1\u2020 M\u03b1 \u03b1\u2020 \u03bb|0i = \u03b1\u2020 M\u03a9\u03bb|0i = E|1i\n\n(42)\n\nand in turn the equality\nM\u03a9\u03bb = E\u03bb .\n\n(43)\n\nI.e., we must diagonalize the effective Hamiltonian matrix H \u2261 M\u03a9 rather\nthan simply M. Explicitly\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nk 0\n0\n\uf8ec 2k\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\nk\n0\nH=\uf8ec\n(44)\n\uf8ed 5\n\uf8f8\n\u221a\n0 0\nk2 + 2\n\nAgain we see that the massive vector decouples with dispersion relation (40).\nWhile the only photon single particle energy eigenstate is\n|\u03b3i \u2261 a\u20202 |0i ,\n\n(45)\n\nwith energy E = k which is the correct Lorentz invariant dispersion relation\nfor massless excitations. The norm of this state h\u03b3|\u03b3i = 0, vanishes however.\nWe can also consider a general photonic single particle state (\u03bda\u20201 +\u03bca\u20202 )|0i.\nThen denoting \u03c1 = \u03bd/\u03bc we find that states with \u03c1 inside the disc\n5\n5\n<\n,\n(46)\n2k 2\n2k 2\nhave positive norm, those on the boundary zero norm and those exterior to\nthe disc negative norm (the state a\u20201 |0i with \u03c1 = \u221e also has negative norm).\nThe only single particle state diagonalizing the Hamiltonian is the zero norm\nstate |\u03b3i corresponding to \u03c1 = 0.\nObserve that positivity properties of norms are improved in the nonrelativistic limit k \u2192 0, for which any \u03c1 in the upper half plane solves (46).\nNonetheless even in this limit the non-unitarity difficulty persists. Another\nmechanism available to cure the instability is to truncate the model by restricting physical states further to the cohomology of an appropriate nilpotent operator. Explicitly, call the top 2\u00d72 block of the effective Hamiltonian\nb Then since any matrix obeys its own characteristic polynomial,\nin (44) H.\nb \u2212 k is nilpotent\nthe matrix N \u2261 H\n\u03c1+\n\nN 2 = 0,\n14\n\n(47)\n\n\fb The cohomology of N in the malevolent photonic\nand commutes with H.\nsingle particle Fock space is trivial, which is promising. We have not computed its cohomology for multiparticle states, but instead remark that this\nmechanism is unlikely to respect Lorentz invariance.\nThe presence of zero and negative norm states signals the breakdown\nof unitary evolution, as evidenced by the non-hermitean effective Hamiltonian matrix H, commensurate with resonant classical single particle wavefunctions growing linearly in time. Whether this instability indicates the\nexistence of other stable but possibly non-Lorentz invariant vacua, or is a\nrunaway instability is an open problem deserving further study. It seems\nlikely that the addition of interparticle interactions is necessary to support a\nstable vacuum.\n\n7\n\nCoherent State Evolution.\n\nLet us consider coherent states in the photonic Fock space4 Denoting \u03b1\nb =\n(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) and similarly employing hats to denote the top 2\u00d72 photonic block\nfor matrices, coherent states diagonalizing the annihilation operators\n\u03b1\nb|zi = z|zi ,\n\nare simply\n\n(48)\n\nb \u22121 z)|0i .\n|zi = exp(b\n\u03b1\u2020 \u03a9\n\n(49)\n\n|z(t)i = eiHt |zi ,\n\n(50)\n\nHere z is a complex 2-vector and the coherent state\nwith the\n\u0013\n\u0012 associated\n0\n.\nphoton single particle state |\u03b3i corresponds to z\u03b3 =\n1\nIts time evolution, given by5\n\nis easily computed to be\nz(t) =\n\nz1\nz2 +\n\n2ikt\nz\n5 1\n\n4\n\n!\n\neikt ,\n\n(51)\n\nThis analysis is similar in spirit to [17], where models with wrong sign potentials and\nsqueezed states are analyzed.\n5\nIn quantum mechanics coherent states evolve classically up to a phase corresponding\nto the zero point energy. As evidenced by (38), we have made the usual field theoretic\nnormal ordering renormalization so this factor is absent.\n\n15\n\n\fwhich is the classical solution found above. Therefore, as usual, coherent\nstates are maximally classical. The inner product for these states is\nb \u22121 z) .\nhw|zi = exp(w \u2020 \u03a9\n\n(52)\n\nb \u22121 z) ,\nhz|zi = exp(z \u2020 \u03a9\n\n(53)\n\nb is a real symmetric matrix, norms of photonic coherent states\nSince \u03a9\n\nare always positive. However, they are are not conserved in time since evolution is no longer unitary (observe that the effective Hamiltonian H in (44)\nis not Hermitean). Instead we find that norms for the time evolved states\n|z(t)i obey\n!\nk(25+4ik 3 t)\n8t2 k 5\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2212\n25\n5\nhz(t)|z(t)i = exp z \u2020\nz\n.\n(54)\n3 t)\n3\n\u2212 k(25\u22124ik\n2k\n5\nObserve that the photon coherent state |z\u03b3 i has a time independent norm\n2\n\n= exp(2k 3 ). In general, however, unitary evolution is violated. In\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\n, corresponding to \u03c1 = \u221e in the notation\nparticular the state with z =\n0\nof the previous Section, has norm behaving as exp(4t2 k 5 /25) for large times.\nThis indicates that coherent combinations of the negative norm single particle states dominate the large time behavior of the model and are primarily\nresponsible for its instability.\n|z\u03b3 i\n\n8\n\nConclusions\n\nThe Yang\u2013Mills detour complex, obtained from an on-shell Poincar\u00e9 Yang\u2013\nMills twist of the Maxwell complex along with a non-minimal coupling, yields\na novel mechanism for coupling higher spins to gravitational backgrounds.\nEven the simplest, flat, fundamental representation version of the model,\nanalyzed in depth here, has a rich spectrum though photon states have nonpositive norms.\nThere are many open questions and directions the model can taken in.\nFirstly, vacua other than the usual Lorentz invariant background, where all\nfields vanish, might be stable. Secondly, the Yang\u2013Mills gauge group G\n16\n\n\fcan be enlarged. Obvious generalizations are to situations with conformal\nsymmetry or supersymmetry where G can be the conformal or super Poincar\u00e9\nalgebra [9].\nIn general, given a complex, it often is possible to search for projections\nto a smaller one where the projections and differentials commute. (I.e., one\nforms a commutative diagram.) Hence, one can search for a smaller complex\nin which the zero norm and negative norm states are excised [9].\nAnother extremely interesting direction is to study models with infinite\ntowers of fields by taking Maxwell fields labeled by infinite dimensional yet\nunitary representations of the Yang-Mills algebra g. These present the possibility of a fundamental theory with quantum consistency in the Lorentz\ninvariant vacuum. Moreover, one might even hope that genuine interparticle interactions (rather than just ones to the background) would be possible\nwith the infinite number of fields as the loophole in the Coleman\u2013Mandula\ntheorem.\n\nAcknowledgments\nIt is a pleasure to thank Stanley Deser and Nemanja Kaloper for discussions and encouragement.
