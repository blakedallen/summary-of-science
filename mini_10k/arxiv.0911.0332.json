It can be stated as follows:\nTheorem 1 (Banach-Alaoglu). Let X be a normed space, then the unit ball X\u22171\nof its dual space is weakly*-compact.\nAs it is well known, the proof of the previous theorem crucially depends on\nTychonoff's product theorem, since one can embeds X\u22171 in a suitable product of\ncompact Hausdorff spaces, namely the product of closed disks in the complex\nplane. Nevertheless, if X is a separable Banach space, the unit ball of its dual is\nmetrizable in the weak* topology, so one can prove the theorem by showing that\nX\u22171 is sequentially compact. This does not require Tycnohoff theorem, rather a\ndiagonal argument does the job, as it was pointed out by Banach in his classic\nreference [2]. Anyway, such a proof requires a countable version of the Axiom\nof Choice.\nOn the other hand, Tychonoff theorem is the most general compactness result\navailable in point set topology. It can be stated in the following manner:\nTheorem 2 (Tychonoff).\nLet {X\u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2208 I} be any family of compact spaces.\nQ\nThen the product \u03b1\u2208I X\u03b1 is a compact space with respect the product topology.\nQ\nFor the reader's convenience, we recall that the product topology\nQ on \u03b1\u2208I X\u03b1\nis the coarser topology forQwhich the projection maps p\u03bb : \u03b1\u2208I X\u03b1 \u2192 X\u03bb\n(p\u03bb (x) = x(\u03bb) for each x \u2208 \u03b1\u2208I X\u03b1 ) are continuous.\nThe proof of the previous theorem requires the Axiom of Choice in one of its\nequivalent formulations (for instance Zorn's lemma). Actually it is equivalent\nto the Axiom of Choice, as it has been shown in [3] by Kelley in 1950.\nWhat we are going to prove is that the Banach-Alaoglu theorem directly\nimplies the following weaker version of the Tychonoff product theorem:\nTheorem 3 (Tychonoff theorem: Hausdorff case).\nQ Let {K\u03b1 } be any family of\ncompact Hausdorff spaces. Then the product \u03b1 K\u03b1 is a compact Hausdorff\nspace with respect to the product topology.\nBefore giving our proof, one probably should mention that the equivalence we\nhave to prove is already known in literature through a quite indirect argument.\nTo be more precise, let us consider the following statements:\n1\n\n\fTheorem 4 (Prime ideal theorem for Boolean algebras: BPI). Every Boolean\nalgebra contains a prime ideal.\nTheorem 5 (Ultrafilters Lemma: UF). Let F be a filter on a set X. Then\nthere exists an ultrafilter G such that F \u0016 G.\nIt is a very well known fact that BPI and UF are equivalent and they both\nare equivalent to the weaker version of Tychonoff theorem 3. In [4], among\nother interesting things dealing with the Hanh-Banach extension theorem and\nits equivalents, it is shown that the Banach-Alaoglu theorem is equivalent to\nBPI. Clearly this shows that the Banach-Alaoglu theorem and the Tychonoff\ntheorem 3 are equivalent.\nNevertheless, to what I know, direct proofs of this equivalence are not known.\nThis paper is devoted to supply this lack, providing a very simple approach in\na pure functional analytic context.\nIn what follows, we will assume the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms (ZF) for set\ntheory deprived of the Axiom of Choice (AC), which easily implies all the theorems quoted above.\nAs a consequence of ZF axioms1 , we can assume the existence of the field R\nof real numbers, together with its completeness property (existence of the least\nupper bound for superiorly bounded subset of R). We observe that the construction of R (starting from the set of natural numbers N) is independent of\nAC.\nWe will think [0, 1] = {x \u2208 R : 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1} \u2282 R endowed with its relative\ntopology, the topology on R being metrizable with distance function given by\nd(x, y) = |x \u2212 y| for each x, y \u2208 R). As a metrizable space, [0, 1] is Hausdorff.\nWe will not need the fact that [0, 1] is compact (Heine-Borel theorem).\nThe first step is to prove that the Banach-Alaoglu theorem implies that Ty.\nchonoff cubes [0, 1]\u039b = {f : \u039b \u2192 [0, 1]} are compact with respect to the pointwise convergence topology (that does coincide with the product topology), \u039b\nbeing any set of indexes. Observe that [0, 1]\u039b is not empty (without assuming\nthe AC), since surely one has [0, 1] \u2282 [0, 1]\u039b , by taking the constant functions.\nHere is our first result:\nTheorem 6. Let \u039b any set of indexes, then the Alaoglu theorem implies that\nthe Tychonoff cube [0, 1]\u039b is compact.\n.\nProof. Put K = [0, 1]\u039b = {f : \u039b \u2192 [0, 1]} (with pointwise topology). Given \u03b1 \u2208\n\u039b, let p\u03b1 be the corresponding projection (evaluation map), i.e p\u03b1 (f ) = f (\u03b1) for\neach f \u2208 K. Let X \u2282 C(K) be the real vector space spanned by the evaluation\nmaps. Note that the sup norm is well defined on X, since the evaluation maps\nare bounded and X is linearly generated by p\u03b1 , as \u03b1 runs \u039b. By the Alaoglu\ntheorem X\u22171 is weakly*-compact. Let us consider the natural inclusion map\ni : K \u2192 X\u22171\ngiven by i(f )(p) = p(f ) for each p \u2208 X, f \u2208 K.\nThis embedding is obviously injective, moreover, thanks to the definition of X,\nit is a homeomorphism between K and i(K). In fact, it is continuous, since\n1 In\n\nparticular, thanks to the infinite axiom.\n\n2\n\n\fK \u220b f \u2192 hi(f ), pi = p(f ) \u2208 R is a continuous function for each p \u2208 X as a\nlinear combination of real valued continuous function (this is the point where\nsome elementary topological properties of R are invoked). Finally, it is an open\nmap onto its image. If U \u2282 K is an open subset, we have to prove that i(U )\nis open in i(K), i.e i(U ) = i(K) \u2229 V , where V \u2282 X\u22171 is a weakly* open subset.\nTo this aim, T\nit is enough to take U running a base of open subset, so we can\nn\nfamily of open subset.\nassume U = j=1 p\u22121\n\u03bbj (Aj ), where Aj \u2282 [0, 1] is a finite T\nA straightforward computation shows that i(U ) = i(K) {\u03c6 \u2208 X\u22171 : h\u03c6, p\u03bbj i \u2208\nAj for each j = 1, 2 . . . , n}, so we get the conclusion, the second set in the right\nside being an open subset as a finite intersection of open sets.\nTo conclude the proof, it only remains to observe that i(K) is closed in X\u22171 , since\none has\n\\\ni(K) =\n{\u03c6 \u2208 X\u2217 : \u03c6(p\u03b1 ) \u2208 [0, 1]}\n\u03b1\u2208\u039b\n\nSo i(K) is compact as a closed subset of a compact space.\nTo get the full result, the following theorem from point set topology is\nneeded. We quote here its proof for completeness' sake. We also want to to\nunderline that its proof does not depend on AC.\nTheorem 7. Let K be a compact Hausdorff space. Then there exist a set \u039b\nand a map i : K \u2192 [0, 1]\u039b , which is an homeomorphism between K and i(K).\nProof. As a compact Hausdorff space, K is normal, so Urysohn lemma applies\n(Urysohn lemma is independent on AC, moreover its proof is by construction).\nLet {U\u03b1 } be a base of open subset. If U\u03b1 \u2282 U\u03b2 , then there exists a continuous\nfunction f : K \u2192 [0, 1] such that f (x) = 0 for each x \u2208 U\u03b1 and f (x) = 1 for each\nx \u2208 X\\U\u03b2 . Let \u039b be the set of pairs (\u03b1, \u03b2) such that U\u03b1 \u2282 U\u03b2 , so if \u03bb \u2208 \u039b there\nis a continuous function f\u03bb (whose values are in [0, 1]) as above. Let us define\nthe map i : K \u2192 [0, 1]\u039b by i(x) = {f\u03bb (x)}\u03bb\u2208\u039b for each x \u2208 K. Observe that the\npossibility of defining this map does not rely on AC, since the correspondence\n\u039b \u2208 \u03bb \u2192 f\u03bb has a rule, namely we associate to \u03bb \u2208 \u039b the function f\u03bb which is\nbuilt as in the proof of Urysohn lemma.\nLet F \u2282 K be a closed subset and x \u2208\n/ F . Then there is U\u03b1 such that x \u2208 U\u03b1\nand U\u03b1 \u2208 K\\F . By normality there is a U\u03b2 such that U\u03b2 \u2282 U\u03b1 and x \u2208 U\u03b2 ;\nthis means that there is a function f\u03bb such that f\u03bb (F ) = 1 and f\u03bb (x) = 0, so i\nis an injective map. Clearly i is continuous. Moreover i is relatively open. To\nsee this, let A \u2282 K be an open set and x \u2208 A, then F = X\\A is closed, so there\nis a f\u03bb such that f\u03bb (x) = 0 and f\u03bb (F ) = 0, so\ni(x) \u2208 {\u03c9 \u2208 [0, 1]\u039b : \u03c9(\u03bb) <\n\n1\n} \u2229 i(K) \u2282 \u0131(A)\n2\n\nThis concludes the proof, since x \u2208 A is arbitrary.\nFinally, we can easily prove the implication in its full generality. Before\nperforming the proof, we want to observe that, given a family of closed subset\nC\u03b1 \u2282 X\u03b1 , where {X\u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2208 I} is any collection of topological spaces, the\n\n3\n\n\f. Q\n. Q\nproduct set CT= \u03b1\u2208I C\u03b1 is a closed2 subset of X = \u03b1\u2208I X\u03b1 , simply because\none has C = \u03b1\u2208I p\u22121\n\u03b1 (C\u03b1 ).\nNow we are able to perform our proof of the quoted implication:\nTheorem 8. Banach-Alaoglu theorem implies Tychonoff theorem for compact\nHausdorff spaces.\nProof. Let {K\u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2208 I} be a family of compact Hausdorff spaces, then there\nis a family Q\nof index-set \u039b\u03b1 suchSthat K\u03b1 \u2282 [0, 1]\u039b\u03b1 (as a closed subspace). Observe that \u03b1\u2208I [0, 1]\u039b\u03b1 \u223c\n= [0, 1] \u03b1\u2208I \u039bS\u03b1 (the union being disjoint) as topological\nQ\nspaces. Put K = \u03b1\u2208I K\u03b1 \u2282 [0, 1] \u03b1\u2208I \u039b\u03b1 . K is a closed subset as product\nof closed sets (K\u03b1 is closed, because it is compact and [0, 1]\u039b\u03b1 is Hausdorff).\nHence K is compact as a closed subset of a compact space.\nThanks to theorem 8, we can also easily conclude that the Banach-Alaoglu\ntheorem and the (apparently more general) Bourbaki-Alaoglu3 theorem are\nequivalent, since the proof of the last depends just on the weaker version of\nTychonoff theorem.\n\nReferences\n[1] L.
