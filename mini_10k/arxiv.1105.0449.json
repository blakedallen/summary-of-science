Despite many years of observations across the electromagnetic spectrum, the system remains, in some respects, poorly characterized. Known to\nIreland\n26\n\nColumbia Astrophysics Laboratory, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA\n\n27\n\nDepartment of Physics and Astronomy, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60208, USA\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n\nbe the pairing of a massive B0 Ve star and a compact object of unknown nature (Hutchings\nand Crampton 1981, Casares 2005), LS I +61\u25e6 303 has been known historically for its energetic outbursts at radio, X-ray, GeV, and TeV wavelengths (Gregory et al 2002, Greiner and\nRau 2001, Harrison et al. 2000, Abdo et al. 2009, Albert et al. 2008, Acciari et al. 2008), all\nof these showing correlation with the 26.5 day orbital cycle of the compact object in its path\naround the Be star. According to the most recent radial velocity measurements, the orbit\nis elliptical (e = 0.537 \u00b1 0.034), with periastron passage determined to occur around phase\n\u03c6 = 0.275, apastron passage at \u03c6 = 0.775, superior conjunction at \u03c6 = 0.081 and inferior\nconjunction at \u03c6 = 0.313 (Aragona et al. 2009). The non-thermal behavior of the source\nis well studied, yet poorly understood. The radio emission presents a well-defined periodicity with strong flares occuring periodically near apastron passage, along with an additional\nmodulation on a 4.6 year timescale (Gregory 2002). The detection of extended structures in\nradio observations originally identified LS I +61\u25e6 303 as a potential microquasar, with high\nenergy emission produced in jets driven by accretion onto the compact object, presumably\na black hole (Massi et al 2001). High-resolution VLBA observations indicate that the radio\nstructures are not persistent, however, and can be more easily explained by the interaction\nbetween a pulsar wind and the wind of the stellar companion (Dhawan et al. 2006, Albert\net al. 2008), although alternative interpretations are still possible (Romero et al. 2007,\nMassi and Zimmerman 2010). The full range of arguments in favor of LS I +61\u25e6 303 as a\nnon-accreting pulsar system have been summarized by Torres (2010a).\nThe X-ray behavior is well studied (see Smith et al. (2009) for a review), most comprehensively in Torres et al. (2010b), in which the authors present an analysis of RXTE-PCA\nobservations taken over four years, covering 35 full orbital cycles. They show that, while\nthe X-ray emission from the source is indeed periodic, there is variability of the orbital profiles on multiple timescales, from individual orbits up to years. Additionally, intense X-ray\nflares have been observed (Smith et al. 2009 and Torres et al. 2010b), during which the\nflux increases by up to a factor of five and variability on the timescale of a few seconds is\nobserved. It is noted, however, that, due to the relatively large RXTE-PCA field-of-view\n(\u223c 1\u25e6 FWHM), the possibility that these flares are due to an unrelated source in the same\nfield cannot be ruled out.\nHigh-energy (HE; 30 MeV-30 GeV) gamma-ray emission, spatially coincident with\nLS I +61\u25e6 303, although with large positional errors, was first detected by COS-B (Hermsen\net al. 1977) and, subsequently, by EGRET (Tavani et al. 1998). The detection of a variable\nvery high energy (VHE; 30 GeV-30 TeV) gamma-ray source at the location of LS I +61\u25e6 303\nwith MAGIC (Albert et al. 2006), later confirmed by VERITAS (Acciari et al. 2008), completed the identification of this source as a gamma-ray binary. The TeV emission reported\nby both experiments for observations made prior to 2008 is spread over approximately one\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n62\n63\n64\n65\n66\n67\n68\n\n69\n70\n71\n72\n73\n74\n75\n76\n77\n78\n79\n80\n81\n82\n83\n84\n85\n86\n\n87\n88\n89\n90\n91\n92\n93\n94\n95\n96\n97\n98\n\nquarter of the orbit, with a peak around apastron (orbital phase \u03c6 = 0.775). Fermi -LAT\nobservations provide the definitive HE detection and have revealed a number of interesting features (Abdo et al. 2009). The HE emission reported in the detection paper (based\non observations from August 2008 until March 2009) is modulated at the orbital period\n(peaking slightly after periastron (\u03c6= 0.225)), although recent results from the LAT show\ndifferent behavior (see Summary and Discussion). The overall Fermi spectrum shows a sharp\nexponential cutoff at 6 GeV.\nThe existence of orbital modulation in the gamma-ray flux is often explained by the\nvarying efficiency of the inverse-Compton process around the orbit, although we note that\nmany alternative explanations exist (see e.g. Sierpowska-Bartosik and Torres (2009) for a\nreview). In this scenario, inverse-Compton gamma-ray production along our line of sight is\nmost efficient at superior conjunction (\u03c6= 0.081), where stellar photons interact head-on with\nenergetic leptons produced either directly in the pulsar wind or in the pulsar wind/stellar\nwind shock interaction region. The density of stellar photons may also play a role in the\nefficiency of gamma-ray production, with the highest density occurring at periastron. The\nTeV flux is further modulated by photon-photon absorption around the orbit, which peaks\nnear superior conjunction and may dominate over the modulation effects due to production\nefficiency at energies above \u223c30 GeV. Orbital modulation of the GeV and TeV flux, with\nlarge differences between the lightcurves observed in each energy band, is therefore not\nunexpected. Other effects, for example Doppler boosting of the emission (Dubus et al.\n2010), clumps in the wind of the Be star (Araudo 2009), tidal disruption of the accretion\ndisk (Romero et al. 2007) or cascading of high-energy photons to lower energies may also\nplay a role, and provide a better fit of the models to the observations. However, it should be\nnoted that the orbital inclination of the system is poorly constrained, and this complicates\nthe modeling of emission from this system.\nSubstantial effort has been invested in constructing multiwavelength datasets on LS I +61\u25e6 303.\nPreliminary studies including TeV data (Acciari et al. 2009 and Albert et al. 2008) combined long-term (multi-orbit) observations at both X-ray and TeV wavelengths. Acciari et\nal. (2009) did not detect any correlation between emission at X-ray and TeV wavelengths\nwith observations taken by VERITAS, Swift-XRT, and RXTE-PCA. However, the multiwavelength observations used were not strictly overlapping, which is problematic given the\nobserved fast (several seconds) variability in the X-ray regime detailed in Smith et al. (2009).\nFurther X-ray/TeV observations reported in Anderhub et al. (2009) detect a correlation between X-ray and TeV emission during a TeV outburst over a single orbital cycle. While the\nauthors show a correlation (with a 0.5% probability of being produced from independent\ndatasets), the longer-scale correlation behavior of the source outside of the observed flare is\nnot well studied.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n99\n100\n101\n102\n103\n\n104\n\n105\n106\n107\n108\n109\n110\n111\n112\n113\n114\n115\n116\n\n117\n118\n119\n120\n121\n122\n123\n124\n125\n126\n127\n128\n129\n130\n131\n132\n\nIn this paper we summarize the results of VERITAS observations of LS I +61\u25e6 303\nbetween 2008 and 2010, including a comparison with strictly contemporaneous X-ray observations. These are the first reported TeV observations since the launch of Fermi in June\n2008, and so they provide an opportunity to examine the broadband high-energy (100 MeV\n- 10 TeV) emission from the source using contemporaneous observations.\n\n2.\n\nVERITAS Observations\n\nThe VERITAS array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs), located in\nsouthern Arizona (1250 m.a.s.l., 31\u25e6 40' N, 110\u25e6 57' W), is composed of four, 12m diameter,\n12m focal length telescopes, each with a Davies-Cotton tessellated mirror structure of 345\nmirror facets (total mirror area of 110 m2 ) (Ong et al. 2009) . Each telescope focuses\nCherenkov light from particle showers onto a 499-pixel photomultiplier tube (PMT) camera.\nThe pixels have an angular spacing of 0.15\u25e6 , resulting in a camera field of view of 3.5\u25e6 . During\nthe summer months of 2009, one of the telescopes in the array was relocated, creating a more\nsymmetric array layout and increasing the sensitivity of the observatory by 30% (Perkins et\nal. 2009). In its current configuration, VERITAS is able to detect a source with a flux of 1%\nof the steady Crab Nebula flux in under 30 hours. VERITAS has the capability to detect\nand measure gamma rays in the 100 GeV to 30 TeV energy regime with an energy resolution\nof 15-20% and an angular resolution of 0.1\u25e6 (68% containment) on an event-by-event basis.\nThe VHE observations presented here were made with VERITAS between October 2008\nand December 2010, sampling eight separate orbital cycles of the binary system. The data\ncomprise 64.5 live-time hours of observations taken with both the original (33.3 hours) and\ncurrent (31.2 hours) array configurations. Data were taken using the complete four-telescope\narray; Cherenkov images which trigger two or more telescopes initiate a read-out of the 500\nMSpS Flash-ADC data acquisition on each PMT. The observations were made in \"wobble\"\nmode in which the source is offset from the center of the field-of-view of the cameras to\nmaximize efficiency in obtaining both source and background measurements (Fomin et al.\n1994). After eliminating data taken under variable or poor sky conditions and applying image cleaning methods to reject images without sufficient signal for reconstruction, gamma-ray\nselection cuts were applied to the data. These selection cuts are based on the image morphology (Mean Scaled Width and Length), and the angular distance between the reconstructed\nposition of the source in the camera plane and the a priori known source location. Cuts\nwere optimized on simulated data for both the old and new array configurations; the analysis presented here was performed with cuts optimized for the detection of a moderately weak\n(5% Crab Nebula flux) source. The data on LS I+61\u25e6 303 were taken over a relatively small\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n133\n134\n\n135\n136\n137\n138\n139\n140\n141\n142\n143\n144\n145\n146\n\nrange of elevation angles (55\u25e6 -60\u25e6) under dark skies (little or no moonlight) resulting in an\nenergy threshold for these observations of 300 GeV.\nIn the entire integrated dataset of 64.5 hours, 176 excess events above background were\ndetected, corresponding to a 3.3\u03c3 statistical excess for steady emission, which does not\nconstitute a significant detection. In Tables 1-3 and Figures 1-3 the results of the three\nyears' observations are shown. For observations (both nightly, and binned by orbital phase)\nwhich did not exhibit a pre-trials excess above 3\u03c3, 99% confidence level flux upper limits\nare calculated using the Helene method (Helene 1983). For nightly observations, these limits\nare typically on the order of 3-10 \u00d710\u221212 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 above 300 GeV or 3-8% of the\nsteady Crab Nebula flux. When binned by orbital phase, the limits extend down to 2-6\n\u00d710\u221212 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 above 300 GeV or 2-5% of the Crab Nebula. Particularly striking\nis the distinct lack of strong TeV emission during the apastron phases of \u03c6 =0.5-0.8 as these\nare the orbital phases during which both MAGIC and VERITAS have previously detected\nstrong (10-20% Crab Nebula) emission.\n\n167\n\nUnexpectedly, in late 2010, gamma-ray emission from the source was detected over a\nregion of the binary orbit previously undetected by TeV instruments (Ong, 2010). From\nSeptember 17 to November 7 2010 (MJD 55455-55507), a total of 13.9 hours on LS I +61\u25e6\n303 were accumulated resulting in the detection of 129 excess events above background. This\nconstitutes a detection at the 5.6\u03c3 post-trials significance level (5.7\u03c3 pre-trials significance\nwith two trials for two sets of analysis cuts: standard analysis cuts and an analysis tailored\nfor harder spectrum sources). During phases 0.0-0.1 (close to superior conjunction at phase\n0.081) the source was observed for a total of 4.2 hours. During this time a total of 66\nexcess events were recorded, corresponding to a 4.8\u03c3 post-trials (5.4\u03c3 pre-trials) significance\n(accounting for twenty trials accumulated by analyzing the data in ten orbital phase bins\nwith two sets of analysis cuts). Since this detection consists of too few events to construct\na differential energy spectrum with comparable statistics to those previously published, we\nassume a spectral index of \u0393 =2.6 (Acciari et al. 2008) in order to produce absolute fluxes.\nThe source flux was measured as 6.86 \u00b1 1.45 \u00d710\u221212 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 above 300 GeV, or\napproximately 5% of the Crab Nebula flux in the same energy range. The source presented\nthe highest observed flux on October 8, 2010 (MJD 55477, \u03c6 = 0.07) with 57 excess events\ndetected in 2.8 hours of observations, corresponding to a 5.2\u03c3 post-trials (5.7\u03c3 pre-trials)\nsignificance, accounting for twenty trials accumulated by analyzing ten individual nights with\ntwo sets of analysis cuts to search for the maximal flux. During these observations the source\nflux was measured as 9.23\u00b11.9 \u00d710\u221212 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 above 300 GeV or approximately\n7% of the Crab Nebula flux.\n\n168\n\nIt should be noted that after appropriate statistical trials are taken into account (for\n\n147\n148\n149\n150\n151\n152\n153\n154\n155\n156\n157\n158\n159\n160\n161\n162\n163\n164\n165\n166\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n169\n170\n171\n172\n\n173\n\n174\n175\n176\n177\n178\n179\n180\n181\n182\n183\n184\n185\n186\n187\n\n188\n189\n190\n191\n192\n193\n194\n195\n196\n\n197\n198\n199\n\n200\n201\n\nbinning on nightly and orbital timescales) the detection during phase 0.0-0.1 and on 10/08/10\nstand as the only statistically significant detections published by any TeV instrument since\n2007. The fact that these detections were made over a region of the orbit not previously\nsuspected to be an active TeV phase is of particular interest.\n\n3.\n\nX-ray Observations\n\nThe RXTE-PCA (Swank 1994) and Swift-XRT (see Gehrels et al. (2004) and Burrows et al. (2005)) data presented here were both obtained from the public data archive\nat http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ and analyzed using the HEASOFT (v6.9) package\n(Blackburn 1995). For RXTE-PCA analysis, standard data quality selection and screening\n(using the \"rex\" script in FTOOLS) was performed. All available data were extracted using\nonly the top layer of Proportional Counting Unit #2 in each observation. The XSPEC 12.6\nsoftware package (Arnaud 1996) was used to fit spectra with a simple absorbed power-law,\nassuming a fixed absorbing hydrogen column density (NH ) of 0.75\u00d71022 cm\u22122 (Kalberla et\nal. 2005) between 3-10 keV and to extract fluxes in the 2-10 keV range. Fluxes were then deabsorbed using the Wisconsin photoelectric cross sections (Morrison and McCammon 1983),\nor the \"wabs\" model within XSPEC. Also, given that the PCA instrument on RXTE is\nknown to give larger fluxes (on the order of 20%) on the same source as other more precise\ninstruments (Tomsick et al. 1999), all the PCA fluxes quoted here have been reduced by a\nfactor of 1.18 in order to provide a more accurate comparison to the Swift-XRT analysis.\nFor the Swift-XRT analysis, all data shown here were accumulated in \"photon counting\nmode\" and analyzed using the most recent Swift-XRT analysis tools with the HEASOFT\n6.2 package. The data were screened with standard filtering criteria and reduced using the\nxrtpipeline task. Background and source spectra were accumulated from each individual\nobservation using circular regions of radius 60\" and 20\", respectively. XSPEC 12.6 was used\nto fit accrued spectra in the 0.3-10 keV range using a simple, absorbed power law with the\ngalactic hydrogen column density fixed at 0.75\u00d71022 cm\u22122 . Flux values and associated 1 \u03c3\nstatistical errors were then calculated by integrating the fitted spectra over the 2-10 keV\nrange.\nFlux values as seen by both instruments (Figures 1-3) show a high degree of variability\nwith values of 2-25 \u00d710\u221212 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 , consistent with other observations of LS I +61\u25e6\n303 with RXTE-PCA and Swift-XRT (i.e. Acciari et al. 2009).\nSince variability of the X-ray emission from LS I +61\u25e6 303 has been demonstrated on\nvarious timescales, we select only data in the two bands which were directly overlapping in\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n202\n203\n204\n205\n206\n207\n208\n209\n210\n\n211\n212\n213\n214\n\n215\n216\n217\n218\n219\n220\n221\n222\n223\n224\n225\n226\n227\n228\n229\n230\n\n231\n232\n233\n234\n235\n\ntime, so as to provide an accurate test for any correlation with VHE emission. Additionally,\nall of the simultaneous X-ray observations were first checked to confirm that there was\nno evidence for X-ray variability within the observation. There are twenty simultaneous\nobservations taken in both X-ray and TeV (grey shaded regions) in the datasets examined\nhere; eight from RXTE-PCA observations and twelve from the Swift-XRT observations. As\ncan be seen in Figure 4, while the X-ray flux varies significantly, none of the points correspond\nto a significant TeV detection. A test for correlation between the two datasets results in a\nPearson product-moment correlation coefficient of -0.03\u00b10.23; which is consistent with two\nuncorrelated datasets.\nWe note that the TeV exposures are typically significantly longer than the corresponding\nX-ray observations. This is unavoidable, given the requirement that the TeV exposure\nbe sufficient to achieve a useful sensitivity; however, it introduces the possibility that the\n(unmeasured) X-ray flux may have varied considerably within the TeV observation.\nTo test whether the correlation between X-ray and TeV emission presented in Anderhub\net al. (2009) would have been measurable in the data presented here, we compared the\nAnderhub correlation fit between X-ray and TeV data points to our data. This fit, along\nwith the Anderhub data points from which it was derived, are shown in Figure 4. Since the\nenergy range of our X-ray observations was different than that presented in Anderhub et\nal. (2-10 keV versus 0.3-10 keV), we have converted the Anderhub fit to our energy range.\nThis modification was derived by scaling the 0.3-10 keV flux range along a spectral fit with\nindex of \u0393=1.6 (consistent with spectral measurements of the source found in Anderhub et\nal. 2009). Using this method, we arrive at a line fit of: F(2-10 keV) [ 10\u221212 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 ]\n= (7.8\u00b10.6) + (0.45\u00b10.1)\u00d7 N(E>300 GeV) [10\u221212 cm\u22122 s\u22121 ]. According to this relation,\nthe highest observed X-ray flux of 14.7\u00b10.7 \u00d710\u221212 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 leads to an expected TeV\n\u221212\nflux above 300 GeV of 15.3+7.1\nphotons cm\u22122 s\u22121 or approximately 10% of the Crab\n\u22125.2 \u00d710\nNebula flux. For the overlapping observation in question, VERITAS observed the source for\na total of 56 minutes and measured a negative fluctuation of events relative to background\ncorresponding to a 99% Helene flux upper limit of 3.3 \u00d710\u221212 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 , a factor of\n4.6 lower than the predicted value.\nWe note that this flux prediction does not take into account the uncertainty in what\nVERITAS would have actually measured in the observation time quoted. However, even\nunder conservative estimates of VERITAS sensitivity (5\u03c3 detection of a 5% Crab-type source\nin \u223c1 hour), a source on the level predicted by the Anderhub correlation used here would\nlikely have yielded strong evidence for a signal detection in the given observation livetime.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n236\n\n237\n238\n239\n240\n241\n242\n243\n244\n245\n246\n247\n248\n\n249\n\n250\n251\n252\n253\n254\n255\n256\n257\n258\n259\n260\n261\n262\n263\n264\n265\n266\n267\n\n268\n269\n\n4.\n\nContemporaneous Fermi -LAT GeV Observations\n\nWe performed aperture photometry on the Fermi -LAT dataset covering LS I +61\u25e6\n303 for the periods during which VERITAS accrued observations from 2008-2010. Using the\npublicly available Fermi analysis tools and an aperture radius of 2.4\u25e6 (found to be optimal for\nthis source in Abdo et al. 2009), we extracted the 100 MeV-300 GeV counts from the source\nin 26.5 day bins, and we used the gtexposure tools to calculate the exposure for each bin.\nFigure 5 shows the result of this analysis (without any background subtraction performed)\nalong with the time periods during which VERITAS observed the source highlighted in\ngrey regions. During each of the VERITAS observation windows indicated in the figure,\nVERITAS observed the source for typically 1-2 hours per night. The periods during which\nVERITAS successfully detected LS I +61\u25e6 303 in late 2010 (last three shaded regions in\nFigure 5) do not correspond to significantly higher or lower GeV flux than the previously\nobserved regions during which VERITAS did not detect the source.\n\n5.\n\nSummary and Discussion\n\nWe have presented the results of TeV observations of the Galactic binary LS I +61\u25e6 303\nmade with the VERITAS array from October 2008 until December 2010. These observations\ncovered eight separate 26.5 day orbital cycles with coverage (though not uniform) of all orbital\ncycles. A comparison with previous observations of this source is useful. In Figure 6 all three\nyears of observations presented in this paper, along with the previously obtained detections\nby both VERITAS and MAGIC (Acciari et al. 2008, Acciari et al. 2009, Albert et al. 2008)\nare shown. In this figure we plot only points from previous observations that had detections\nabove 3\u03c3 along with the currently obtained flux upper limits and detection near periastron.\nThe previously published fluxes quoted at a different energy threshold were converted to >300\nGeV fluxes using a spectral index of -2.5, consistent with published spectra of the source\n(Acciari et al. 2009). The data shown here do not indicate any significant evidence for\nTeV emission during the orbital phases previously detected by VERITAS and MAGIC (i.e.,\nnear apastron passage), with flux upper limits derived which are \u223c2-3 times lower than the\npreviously detected emission. Instead, the source has been detected for the first time during\norbital phases 0.0-0.1, close to superior conjunction (at \u03c6 = 0.081). A further implication\nof these observations is that there is no direct evidence that the process responsible for the\ndetected Fermi-LAT emission continues beyond the published 6 GeV cut-off: all published\nspectra show only non-contemporaneous data.\nAn important caveat to these points is that we cannot rule out the existence of nearapastron TeV emission during the 2008-2010 timeframe. As is the case with all TeV obser-\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n270\n271\n272\n273\n274\n275\n276\n277\n278\n279\n\n280\n281\n282\n283\n284\n285\n286\n287\n288\n\n289\n290\n291\n292\n293\n294\n295\n296\n297\n\n298\n299\n300\n301\n302\n303\n304\n305\n\nvations, the sampling of the VHE flux from LS I +61\u25e6 303 was unavoidably limited, with\nobservations taking place separated by days and only for integrations lasting several hours.\nFurthermore, since the orbital period of LS I +61\u25e6 303 (\u223c27 days) is very close to the lunar cycle; full-orbit observations of LS I +61\u25e6 303 with ground-based TeV telescopes are\nlimited by their inability to observe during bright moon phases. The observations sampled\nonly 8 orbits out of 27 covered by these two years, and observations in 2009-2010 focussed\nexclusively on orbital phases \u03c6 = 0.5 \u2212 0.8. This leaves open the possibility that the source\nwas active at VHE in some of the unobserved orbits during apastron passage. Also, the\npossibility exists that the sampling provided by the VERITAS observations simply missed\nthe significant TeV activity.\nWe have also presented both contemporaneous and directly overlapping X-ray observations taken with Swift-XRT and RXTE-PCA. The 20 directly overlapping X-ray observations\ndo not show any evidence for correlation with the TeV emission. This stands in contrast\nsomewhat to the result of Anderhub et al. (2009), in which a correlation was detected between X-ray and TeV emission. However, the result of Anderhub et al. (2009) was obtained\nduring a TeV outburst covering 60% of a single orbit, and this paper makes no claim of\nlonger-term correlation between the two emission bands. We see no evidence for such a\ncorrelation during the observations taken here, which were obtained over several different\norbital cycles.\nDuring the 2008-2010 period, the GeV flux was monitored by Fermi -LAT. Dubois et\nal. (2010) have shown that the most recent Fermi -LAT GeV observations showed a marked\nflux increase, of \u223c40%, in March 2009, after which the previously clear orbital GeV flux\nmodulation is no longer measurable. The result of Torres et al. (2010b) shows that, while\nthe X-ray periodicity of the source is well defined, it is not entirely stable; the degree of\nmodulation, and the phase of the peak of the emission varies from orbit-to-orbit and yearto-year. These results, compounded by the TeV measurements in this paper, indicate that\nthe non-thermal emission from LS I +61\u25e6 303 is not as stable as its southern hemisphere\ncounterpart, LS 5039.\nTorres (2010a) has suggested that the GeV emission characteristics can be simply explained by invoking a two-component model, where the observed flux is the result of magnetospheric (pulsar) emission, plus a wind contribution produced either in the inter-wind\nregion and/or the pulsar wind zone. The magnetospheric contribution would be steady, and\nexhibit a sharp spectral cut-off at \u223c 6 GeV, while the wind contribution would be expected\nto vary naturally with orbital phase. If the rate of particle acceleration is the main factor\ndetermining the GeV and TeV fluxes, then the observations reported here do not seem to\nsupport this idea in its simplest form. Since the wind component is expected to be sensitive\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n306\n307\n308\n309\n310\n311\n312\n313\n\n314\n315\n316\n317\n318\n319\n320\n321\n322\n323\n324\n325\n326\n327\n328\n\n329\n330\n331\n332\n333\n\n334\n335\n336\n337\n338\n339\n340\n\nto orbital modulation, and it provides the primary contribution to the TeV emission, the\nGeV flux increase since March 2009 should naturally lead to a larger fraction of the flux\nbeing modulated with the orbital period, and to increased TeV flux. The opposite of both\nof these effects is observed. Other factors may affect this conclusion, however; for example,\nincreased inverse-Compton cooling may cause the spectrum to steepen, enhancing the GeV\nflux and decreasing the TeV flux. The system may also have moved into a state where the\nCompton process has saturated, and the output spectrum is largely independent of the input\nphoton flux, thus explaining the disappearance of orbital modulation.\nHow can this apparent long term variability be explained? The results of radio monitoring (Gregory 2002) show a definite modulation of the phase and peak flux density of the\nradio outbursts with a period of 1667 \u00b1 8 days. In Gregory and Neish (2002) this effect is\nattributed to a model where a pulsar is embedded in a co-planar fashion within the equatorial disk of the Be star. The long term modulation then results from periodic enhancements\nof the stellar wind density within the disk. If this is the case, and the HE-VHE emission\nresults from the same particle population as the radio emission, then perhaps the long term\nvariation in these bands is not unexpected. It certainly seems likely, given the contrast with\nthe stability of the orbital lightcurves of LS 5039 (Kishishita et al. 2009, Aharonian et al.\n2006, Abdo et al. 2009), that variations in the circumstellar environment of the Be star play\nan important role in determining the variability of the observed emission. Sensitive TeV\nobservations of LS I +61\u25e6 303 began only in September 2005, while Fermi was launched in\nJune 2008. Continued monitoring over the coming years from X-ray to TeV will allow us to\nprobe longer-term cycles, to study the cross-correlations in more detail and to characterize\nthe emission spectra more precisely.\nThis research is supported by grants from the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S.\nNational Science Foundation, the Smithsonian Institution, by NSERC in Canada, by Science\nFoundation Ireland (SFI 10/RFP/AST2748) and by STFC in the U.K..
