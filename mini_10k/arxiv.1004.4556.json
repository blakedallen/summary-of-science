Coulomb blockade characteristics\nreveal a double quantum dot behavior in a parallel configuration, making our system a molecular\nequivalent to a semiconducting double-quantum-dot system. As the gate voltage is increased the\ncharging of the second dot by an additional electron induces a splitting of the Kondo peak. We\ndiscuss possible origins of this effect including a spin transition into a high-spin state.\n\nThe Kondo effect, originally observed in diluted magnetic alloys is induced by the interaction between a local spin and conduction electrons [1]. In a quantum\ndot(QD), this effect gives rise to a zero-bias conductance\npeak (ZBP) for charge states with a total spin S=1/2\n[2, 3]. When a magnetic field is applied, the degeneracy of\nthe spin state is lifted by the Zeeman effect and a splitting\nof the ZBP is observed [4]. In the absence of a magnetic\nfiled, a split ZBP corresponding to a bias-induced transition from singlet to triplet state can also be observed\nfor charge states with an integer spin [5\u20137]. Another system where the Kondo effect has been investigated is the\ntwo impurities system originally described by Jones et al.\n[8]. For example, split ZBPs have been observed in double QD systems where two dots interact via a conducting\nregion or via direct tunneling [9, 10]. The exchange interaction between the spin of the two dots lifts the degeneracy of the ground state. Besides semiconducting double\nQDs, this effect has been observed in only a few other\nsystems: in metallic dots containing magnetic impurities\n[11] and in scanning tunnelling microscopy experiments\nwith two interacting magnetic atoms [12]. In addition\nto the fundamental interest in studying the Kondo effect\non single impurities, some of those works have been motivated by the general goal of addressing and manipulating\nsingle spins with possible application in quantum information processing [13]. Particularly promising systems\ntowards this direction are magnetic molecules in which\nthe exchange coupling between the spins can be manipulated by charging the molecule with an electric field [14].\nIn this letter, the Kondo effect is used to characterize\nthe exchange interaction inside a single-molecule transistor (SMT) containing a spin transition (ST) molecule.\nThis type of compound supports a transition between\na low-spin (LS) and a high-spin (HS) state, which can\nbe induced by a change in temperature, pressure, magnetic field or by light irradiation [15]. We have studied\na ST molecule containing a Fe2+ metal ion connected\nto two ligands : [Fe-(L)2 ]2+ [L=4'-(4\"'-pyridyl)-1,2':6'1\"bis-(pyrazolyl)pyridine] (referred to as [Fe-(L)2 ]2+ ) (see\n\nFig. 1(a)). This molecule shows a reversible thermally\ndriven spin transition at 286 K in its bulk crystalline form\n[16]. This type of ST molecule is particularly suited for\nstudies in a SMT geometry since the charge state of the\nmolecule can be modified by applying a potential on the\ngate electrode. According to recent ab-initio calculations\n[17], this charging may drive the ST from LS to HS in\nanalogy to charge transfer ST compounds [18].\n(a)\n\n((b)\nb\n\nC\nN\nFe\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic representation of: (a) the molecule [Fe(L)2 ]2+ [L=4'-(4\"'-pyridyl)-1,2':6'1\"-bis-(pyrazolyl)pyridine]\nand (b) the the transistor geometry.\n\nTo connect the molecule, we fabricate nanometer sized\ngaps by a controlled electromigration process on a thin\nAu wire deposited on top of an oxidized Al gate [19].\nElectromigration and the subsequent self breaking of the\nwire is carried out at room temperature in a solution containing the molecule; the solvent is subsequently evaporated. If a molecule is trapped in the gap a three terminal\ndevice is formed in which the molecule connects via tunnel barriers to source and drain electrodes and couples\nelectrostatically to an external gate (see Fig. 1(b)).\nWe present in Figs. 2(a) and 3(a) the differential conductance over bias and gate voltage obtained at T =\n1.5 K for two samples, A and B.

A ZBP, characteristic of the Kondo effect,\nis observed for both samples in a pronounced regime of\ngate voltages. For sample A, the Kondo temperature extracted from the temperature dependence of the zero-bias\nconductance of the Kondo peak [20] presented in Fig. 5\nis TKA \u2248 70 K. For sample B, a temperature TKB \u2248 25\nK is deduced from its full width at half height.\n\n0\n\nFIG. 3: (a) Differential conductance of sample A versus\nsource-drain (Vb ) and gate (Vg ) voltages.

The black (red) traces\ncorrespond to gates voltages on the right (left) hand side of\nthe diagonal line.\n\nIn addition to this typical SMT behavior we observe\na particular feature visible as a diagonal line (indicated\nby a red arrow) in the differential conductance plots of\nFigs. 2(a,b) and 3(a,b). In Fig. 3(a) on the right hand\nside of this line, a shift \u2206Vg of the Coulomb diamond\nedges in gate voltage is present, which finds a natural\ninterpretation as a response to a modification of the electrostatic environment. This feature can be reproduced\nby a Coulomb blockade model which is based on a scenario with two parallel dots: current flows through one\nQD, the \"transfer dot'\" in the presence of a second dot,\nthe \"spectator dot\"(see Fig. 4(a)). This second dot is\nelectrostatically coupled to the first dot and as its tunnel coupling to one of the electrodes is very weak; there\nis no net current through it. However when the gate\nvoltage is increased this dot can be charged by an additional electron, thereby, modifying the electrostatic environment of the other dot via their mutual capacitance\nCM . This charging induces an horizontal shift of the\nCoulomb diamond edges by \u2206Vg . Fig. 4(b) shows the re-\n\nsult of a rate equation calculation of two single-level QDs\ncapacitively-coupled (see supplementary information for\nmore details), which mimics the situation for sample B.\nWe will discuss later the most likely physical origin of\nthis double dot scenario.\nWe first focus on the low-bias regime. A zoom of this\nregion is shown in Fig. 2(b) and 3(b). For sample A the\nZBP is clearly split on the right hand side of the diagonal line and two peaks appear at \u00b1eVb = \u00b1\u2206A = \u00b12.75\nmeV (see Fig. 2(c)). The temperature dependence of\nthe ZBP and split ZBP are presented in Fig. 5(a,b). In\ncase of the split ZBP, the zero-bias conductance G(0)\nexhibits a nonmonotonic temperature dependence (Fig.\n5(c)). For sample B the splitting is less pronounced and is\nvisible as a reduction of the zero bias conductance (Fig.\n3(c)). When the gate voltage is further increased the\nsplitting becomes more pronounced due to the decrease\nof the Kondo temperature as we go away from the degeneracy point [21]. For the trace indicated as \"e\" in\nFig. 3(c) we extract a splitting \u2206B \u22480.5 meV for sample B. Split ZBP as well as nonmonotonic temperature\ndependence of G(0) are reminiscent of spin-spin interactions competing with Kondo screening, as observed in\ncoupled QDs systems [9, 10] and described theoretically\nin Refs. [22, 23]. With this in mind one might expect\nthat the split ZBP is induced by interactions between the\ntwo spins of the double dot also in our case. This explanation would be consistent with the observed transport\n\n\f3\n\u22124\n\nx 10 (nS)\n8\n\n(b) 20\n\n(a)\n\nVb (mV)\n\nT\n\n0\n\nT\n\n(c)\n\n2\n\nI\n\nII\n\nIII\n\n0\n\u22122\n\u22124\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\nVg (V)\n\n1.2\n\n(d)\nS\n\nS\nT\n\n(c)\n\n4\n\nS\n\n\u221210\n\u221220\n0\n\n(b)\n\n6\n\n10\n\nS\n\n(a)\n\nT\n\nFIG. 4: (a) Schematic representation of the double dot system.

On the left hand side (region I), the transfer\ndot (1) has an even occupancy (as confirmed by the absence of Kondo peak in this region in Fig. 3(a)). When\nthe gate voltage is increased (region II), the transfer dot\nis charged by an additional electron, leading to an odd\noccupancy, St =1/2 and the observation of a Kondo peak\n(Fig. 2(a) and 3(a)). In region III the spectator dot is in\nturn charged leading to an odd occupancy St =Ss =1/2 of\nboth dots, if an even occupancy is assumed for the spectator dot on the left hand side of the diagram. A sizable\nspin interaction between the transfer and the spectator\ndot could then explain the experimentally observed peak\nsplitting. However, as we will argue below the estimated\nexchange interaction between the two dots is typically\ntoo small in order to account for the experimentally observed value \u2206A,B =0.5-3 meV. Here the spin transition\nwill come in.\nTwo possible physical realizations of the double-dot\nscenario, Ri and Re , are conceivable (see Fig. 4(c) and\n4(d)). In the first realization, Ri , we make explicit\nreference to the internal molecular structure of our [Fe(L)2 ]2+ molecule. To support this scenario, we have carried out ab-inito density functional theory (DFT) calculations [17] (see also supplementary information) on the\nmolecule. The two bi-pyrazolyl-pyridine ligands support\n\u03c0-systems, which are oriented perpendicularly to each\nother by the octahedral coordination around the Fe2+\nmetal ion. Therefore, left and right ligand states hybridize only weakly with each other. In particular, for\n\nFIG. 5: (a) and (b) Temperature dependence of differential conductance traces of sample A versus Vb taken respectively for Vg =2.2V and Vg =3.2V. (c) Temperature dependence of the zero bias conductance in (a) and (b) . The\nred line represents the fit obtained from the functional form\nG(T ) = G(0)[1 + (21/s \u2212 1)(T /TK )2 ]s [20, 21] using s = 0.22\nand TKB =70 K.\n\nthe situation of double reduction (i.e., when two excess\nelectrons are added) our calculations confirm that each\nelectron is localized on one ligand only, with very little excess charge penetrating the region connecting the\ntwo ligands near the Fe2+ ion. In the asymmetric situation where one ligand is connected with two electrodes\nvia \u03c0-ligand metal-electrode half-sandwich type binding\ninteractions [24], and the other one only to a single electrode (as represented in Fig. 4(c)), the double dot system\nsketched in Fig. 4(a) is indeed realized. In the alternative way to produce a double dot system, Re , one could\nimagine an extrinsic spectator dot, that does not form a\nchemical bond with the original molecule, e.g. a second\nmolecule or a small metallic grain (see Fig. 4(d)).\nWe start the discussion with the scenario Ri as\nillustrated in Fig.4 (c).\nA first estimate for the\nligand-ligand exchange coupling (with the molecule being in the LS state) may be obtained using JiL\u2212L \u223c\n\u033a2 U (\u033a=t/EHOMO\u2217 : relative energy splitting between\nsymmetric/anti-symmetric combinations of ligand orbitals; U: effective interaction energy in the near ion\nregion of wavefunction overlap, roughly approximated\nby the eg -t2g -splitting: U<\n\u223c \u2206oct ). We have typically\n\u033a \u22480.1-1%, U\u22485 eV, so Ji <\n\u223c0.01-1meV. This rough estimate is fully supported by our ab initio calculations\n[17] (CASSCF level, see supplementary information) that\npredict for the LS state a weak ligand-ligand ferromagL\u2212L\nnetic exchange coupling Ji,LS\n\u22480.095 meV. Essentially,\nthis low value is due to the suppression of the tunneling\nmatrix elements, t, between the two ligand systems. It is\nonly weakly modified if a small variation of the 90\u25e6 angle between the ligands is taken into account (0.15meV\nchange at 20\u25e6 ). To further support the theoretical arguments, we can compare these values with observed exchange splittings for LS transition metal complexes [25],\nwhich are in the \u03bceV range. In conclusion, according\n\n\f4\nto our calculations, the scenario Ri when assuming a LS\nstate leads to an exchange coupling too small to explain\nthe observed splitting \u2206A,B .\nNow, in the second case involving an extrinsic dot, Re ,\nthe direct tunneling between the spectator and the transfer dot [9, 26] should be expected to be even smaller than\nin the scenario Ri since they are not connected via a\nchemical bond. Hence, also the associated exchange coupling will be very small. Of course, in principle there is\nan additional indirect interaction due to the RKKY coupling via the leads [10, 11]. An accurate estimation of this\nsplitting is difficult to obtain as it depends strongly on the\nspatial configuration and geometry of the dots and electrodes. However, we argue that the associated exchange\ncoupling should anyways be very weak. This is because\ncoherent tunneling processes connecting the two dots\nhave to take electrons across two barriers: from the spectator dot into the leads and then from the leads into the\ntransfer dot (and the same way back to establish coherence). The parametrical estimate (\"golden rule\" type) for\nthe associated coupling is JRKKY\n\u2248 \u0393t \u0393s /\u2206ts /(rts kF )2\ne\n(\u0393t,s : electrode induced broadening of the molecular levels of the transfer and spectator dot; \u2206st : mismatch of\nthe two coupled energy levels; rts kF : spatial distance of\nthe two contact points of the two dots with the electrodes\nmeasured in units of the Fermi-wavelength). Assuming\n\u0393t,s \u224810 meV, \u2206ts \u2248 100 meV and rts kF \u2248 3 \u2212 10 typical values of JRKKY\nlie between 0.01-0.1 meV. Hence\ne\nwe conclude: an explanation of the observed split ZBP,\nwhich would be based on a conventional spin-spin interaction inside a double-dot seems hardly consistent with\nthe values of the observed splittings \u2206A,B .\nSo far, our analysis was based on the assumption that\nthe molecule is in the LS state. However, a detailed theoretical analysis suggests that the LS state may give way\nagainst a HS state when the [Fe-(L)2 ]2+ molecule is doubly charged [17]. Accordingly, the molecule could be in\nits LS state in region I and II, while it would be in the\nHS state in region III. In HS the Fe2+ core possesses\na spin S = 2 which is antiferromagnetically coupled to\nthe spins on the ligands. The ground state is thus a\nspin triplet[17] [28] Due to the spin-orbit interaction the\ntriplet splits into a Kramer's doublet and a singlet state.\nIn the optimized high-spin geometry of our molecule, we\nfind that this zero field splitting, \u2206E, is about 0.16 meV.\nThis value will be larger if distortions due to incorporation in the planar device geometry are present and our\npreliminary calculations suggests that it can reach values\nof several meV. We thus expect that among all the possible scenarios, RHS\ngives rise to the strongest splittings\ni\nwhich approach the experimental values of a few meV.\nIn summary we have observed a double-quantum-dot\nbehavior in combination with a split Kondo peak. We\nsuggest that the split ZBP indicates a charged-induced\nspin-transition inside the molecule. To reach a definitive\nconclusion in favor of this high-spin scenario, further ex-\n\nperiments, which could involve, e.g., a detailed measurement of the Kondo splitting in magnetic fields, would be\nneeded. The observation of such a spin-transition would\nbe an important step towards the development of molecular spintronics, as it demonstrates the possibility of addressing and controlling with an electric field individual\nspin states engineered at the molecular scale.\nWork in part financed by the Dutch funding agency\nFOM, by the DFG priority program SPP1243 and the\nCFN at the KIT.
