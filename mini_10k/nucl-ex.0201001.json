The second important point is the separation between the projectiles and\nthe complete fusion evaporation residues (ER) emitted at forward angle after the\nproduction target. Originally, the LISE3 Wien filter [2] was designed to improve the\nseparation of exotic nuclei produced by fragmentation of the projectile and selected\nby the LISE spectrometer. Then, an important work has been done to adapt it\nto fusion experiments improving its ability to work with very high primary beam\nintensities.\nAn experimental setup composed of a dedicated rotating target, beam diagnostics, time detectors and a set of Si-detectors (for the implantation and decay\nproducts) has been developed. Finally a digital electronics is under development to\nreach extremely short decay times in the order of few \u03bc\u2212seconds.\nThe response of the whole setup was checked via fusion reactions with known\ncross sections and \u03b1 decay chains: 204,206 Fr87 nuclei formed via 86 Kr+nat Sb with\ncross sections of 10 to 300 \u03bcbarn [4]. These equipments were then used for an experiment dedicated to the system 86 Kr on 208 Pb and the transmission and the rejection\nfactor of the Wien filter were precisely measured in an experiment dedicated to the\nproduction of the Sg element (Z=106) through the system 54 Cr+208 Pb. Comparison with known values for the excitation energy function [1] allowed to check the\nexcellent transmission together with an high rejection factor.\nAn experimental program has been established for the production of new elements and/or new isotopes with two principal axes: \u2212 i \u2212 the use of the inverse\nkinematics with a beam of Lead and \u2212ii \u2212 the use of the neutron-rich 76 Ge as projectile. Another program dedicated to the study of the properties of SHE has also\nstarted recently.\n\n2\n\nExperimental setup\n\nA general overview of the experimental setup, from the reaction chamber to the\ndetection setup is presented in Figure 1.\n\n2.1\n\nReaction chamber\n\nThe reaction chamber contains two 67 cm diameter wheels bearing 35 targets\n(5.0*1.5 cm2 each) and rotating up to 2000 RPM, allowing targets with low melting\ntemperature (like Pb or Bi) to sustain very intense primary beams. The second\nwheel support carbon stripper foils in order to re-equilibrate the charge state of\nevaporation residues. The time structure of the beam is synchronized with the\nrotation. Two smaller wheels allow us to run with targets having higher melting\ntemperatures. A Si detector continuously monitors the status of each target via\nelastic scattering reactions.\n\n2\n\n\f2.2\n\nWien filter\n\nThe LISE3 Wien filter has crossed magnetic and electric fields in a rather compact\ngeometry and its angular acceptance is \u00b136\u03c0mrad. It is divided into two identical\nhalves and is followed by a dipole magnet. Several modifications were found to\nbe necessary for fusion experiments: -i - the upper plate in the first half of the\nfilter was moved up by 2 cm in order to deflect the beam without hitting the\nelectrode. The beam is now stopped on a new water-cooled collimator, -ii - two pairs\nof independently movable slits and a beam profiler were installed at mid-filter. An\nadditional background suppression can be performed using the last dipole magnet\nlocated between the Wien filter and the detection chamber. The transmission of\nfusion nuclei from the target position through the quadrupoles, filter and final dipole\nwas studied via a simulation code [3]. The optics are checked and the Wien filter\nis calibrated using low energy ions (0.35 MeV/u to have the same speed than ER's\nafter the target).\n\n2.3\n\nDetectors\n\nThe detection setup (see Figure 2) is composed of two Galottes (carbon foils +\nMCP's time detectors) and 13 Si detectors. The time detectors are used in order to\ntag all the events (ER's or background) coming from the beam. Since the efficiency\nof Galotte for light particles might not be 100%, two of them are used. Then, the\n\"implantation events\" are those with an implantation energy signal in coincidence\nwith both Galottes whereas the \"\u03b1\" or fission events are those in anti-coincidence.\nThe implantation detector is a 300\u03bcm thick Si 48x48 strips. The distance between\nthe strips is reduced (\u223c45\u03bcm) to have a dead zone inferior to 5%. Two of them\nare mounted on a movable arm. When emission of \u03b1-particles or fission fragments\nis identified via electronics, the beam is immediately stopped for a short while\nduring which the first implantation detector is moved out of the beam and the\nsecond implantation detector comes in, then the beam is sent again. This technique\nallows us to wait for very long decay times in the first implantation detector, being\ncompletely free of background coming from the beam. The ER's are implanted at a\ndepth of approximately 10 \u03bcm which is smaller than the range in Si for \u03b1 particles\nwith energy above 2.5 MeV. Then, in order to measure the full energy of the \u03b1\nparticles emitted at backward angles which escape the implantation detector, a set\nof 8 Si detectors is mounted in a 'tunnel' geometry. With this configuration, the\nefficiency for full \u03b1 energy goes up from 55 to 95%. A 'face' Si detector is placed\nin front of the 'out of beam' implantation detector in order to play the same role,\nthe efficiency being then 100%. A veto Si detector is placed after the implantation\ndetector to eliminate the background of light particles coming from the beam. All\nthe Si detectors are mounted on copper supports and can be cooled to reduce the\nelectronic noise.\n\n2.4\n\nData acquisition and Electronics\n\nSpecific electronics and data acquisition systems were developed. We use for the\ndata acquisition a complete VXI system for which the standard dead-time is around\n150\u03bcs. In order to reduce it, a multi-trigger logic with 2 sets of converters (ADC's) is\nworking in the following way: the hard trigger provided by the electronics enters into\ntwo GMT (Ganil Master Trigger) modules, T1 and T2. In case of usual counting\n\n3\n\n\frate, all the triggers are treated as 'T1' and the events are registered into the first\nset of converters. This way is exactly the same as the usual one used in many\nexperiments. The same signals are also duplicated into the second set of converters\nbut are not yet considered by the acquisition. In case of a new trigger comes during\nthe dead time of GMT1, it is now treated by GMT2 (as a trigger 'T2') while GMT1\ncontinues to deal with the preceding event. The minimum time between two events\nis then about 30\u03bcs. This procedure was tested with a strong \u03b1-source before the\nexperiment. The used converters are new 14-bits ADC's which allow to have a good\nresolution for \u03b1-particles (less than 50 keV) together with a large range of energy,\nbetween 300 keV and 250 MeV (necessary for spontaneous fission events).\nA fast analysis program allows us to identify 'on line' \u03b1-decay chains or spontaneous fission and then to stop the beam and move out the implantation detector\n(see sect. 2.3)\nA complete read out digital electronics is actually under development to be able\nto reach extremely short decay times, in the order of few \u03bcsec keeping good energy\nresolution (less than 50 keV) on a large energy range from 1 MeV to 1 GeV. This new\ndigital electronics will be placed after the analog front-end electronics (preamplifiers)\nand the main idea of such an approach is to adapt a dedicated processing to each\nevent on a very large dynamical range and without limitation due to the recovery\ntime of the preamplifier.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nExperimental results\nExperiment on\n\n86\n\nKr +\n\n208\n\nPb system\n\nIn July 1999, the BGS-Berkeley group reported the observation of 3 events of the\nnew element Z=118 identified by \u03b1-decay with chains of 6 \u03b1's [5]. The reported\ncross section was much larger than expected (\u223c2 pb) and the same system studied\nwith the velocity filter SHIP at Darmstadt did not lead to the observation of this\nelement [7], justifying to repeat this experiment at GANIL in december 99. Since\nGANIL is able to deliver an high intensity beam of 86 Kr (15\u03bcA with charge 10+,\ni.e. nearly 1013 projectiles/sec), our idea was to confirm (or not) Berkeley's result\nand, in the case of a positive answer, to obtain additional information: -i - be able\nto reach shorter decay times (by the use of fast electronics, see sect. 2.4.) for\npossible \u03b1 decay before the minimum time of 120 \u03bcsec in the Berkeley experiment,\n-ii - wait for very long decay times (by the use of movable implantation detectors,\nsee sect. 2.3.), -iii - since ER's may be created in an isomeric state which decays\nvia electron capture followed by an electron cascade with an unknown half-live\nmodifying the ionic charge and strongly reducing the transmission in the case of\nthe GSI experiment, the carbon stripper foils were in our experiment located at a\ndistance from the target 3 times larger than in the SHIP experiment.\nWith a total accumulated dose of 1.1x1018 ions at 5.27 MeV/u on targets of\n300 \u03bcg/cm2 , we didn't observe any event corresponding to the decay of element\n118.\nThe result of Berkeley was recently retracted [6].\n\n3.2\n\nExperiment on\n\n54\n\nCr +\n\n208\n\nPb system\n\nIn order to measure precisely the transmission and the rejection factor of the LISE3\nWien filter for SHE's, an experiment dedicated to the production of the Sg106 el-\n\n4\n\n\fement through the system 54 Cr on 208 Pb was performed at GANIL in december\n2000. With a primary beam intensity of 40 nAp and 2 incident energies (4.698 and\n4.756 MeV/u), we observed 10 events of 261 Sg106 (1 neutron evaporation channel)\nand 2 events of 260 Sg106 (2 neutrons evaporation channel). The decay chains were\nidentified by position correlation between the implantation of the ER and the decay events in the implantation detector. Comparison with the known excitation\nenergy functions [1] makes possible to deduce a transmission efficiency above 60%\ntogether with a power of suppression of the primary beam and scattered projectiles of \u223c2x1010 , corresponding to a counting rate of 5-10 Hz in the implantation\ndetector.\n\n4\n4.1\n4.1.1\n\nShort and Middle range Perspectives\nInverse kinematics\nMethod\n\nThe use of the inverse kinematics (heavy projectile on light target) has been tried\nat GANIL in June 1999 and will be used in spring 2002 on the system 208 Pb+54 Cr\nto produce 261,260 Sg106 isotopes [8]. This technique presents several assets in comparison with direct kinematics\n-i - the target thickness is no longer limited by multiple scattering of the ER's\nand it becomes possible to use thicker targets covering an excitation energy range\nof typically 10 MeV instead of 3-4 MeV. The counting rate is then maximized and\nthe gain in time can be very important. Indeed, in the search for new isotopes or\nnew elements, the incident energy depends strongly on the mass defects which differ\nin different mass tables by several MeV whereas the excitation function is rather\nnarrow.\n-ii - the ER's are more strongly focussed at forward angles resulting in a better\ntransmission through the LISE3 filter.\n-iii - because of the higher energy after the target, the ionic charge distribution of ER's is better estimated and its relative width is smaller. Here again the\ntransmission is favoured.\n-iv - finally, the quality of the data is better: due to the deeper implantation\ndepth, the energy deposited by the ER's is higher, both fission fragments are stopped\nand escaping \u03b1 particles lose more than 2 MeV and then cannot be missed.\nThe main drawback of this approach concern the velocity difference between the\nbeam and the ER's which is much smaller than in direct kinematics. Then, higher\nelectric and magnetic fields are necessary in the Wien filter. With the new power\nsupplies installed this year, the LISE3 filter will be able to get the same spatial\nseparation at mid-filter as in direct kinematics.\n\n4.1.2\n\nUse of\n\n208\n\nPb beam\n\nSeveral systems can be studied for different purposes (summarized in Table 1):\n\u2212i \u2212 New paths to known isotopes with 208 Pb : Produce the same isotopes of\nthe odd Z compound nuclei than ER's formed at GSI with a 209 Bi target [1]. Here,\ntwo points are of interest: first, measure and then compare the cross sections which\nwill give a clue to the respective roles of macroscopic and structure effects: charge\n\n5\n\n\fasymmetry of the entrance channel and closed shells effects. Secondly, produce ER's\nin different levels, especially isomeric states.\n\u2212ii \u2212 New isotopes with 207 Pb : Produce isotopes lighter by 1 neutron than the\nones known for several elements: 260 Bh107 , 265 Mt109 , 271 111 and 276 112. For the last\ntwo cases, a chain of 3 \u03b1's will be observed before reaching a known isotope, i.e. 3\nnew isotopes will be observed in one event.\n\u2212iii \u2212 New elements : Above Z=109 the counting rates are very low. For 277 112,\nmeasurements were made at one beam energy only, not necessarily at the maximum\nof the excitation function. The broader energy coverage provided by inverse kinematics may reveal a larger cross section. Moreover, the 1n channel cross section\ndecreasing quickly with Z, it may be that the 0n cross section becomes larger even\nthrough the fusion probability drops very much at the corresponding incident energy.\nAdded to the uncertainty on the compound nucleus mass defect, the exploration of\na broad range of incident energies corresponding to 0n+1n channels leads to lengthy\nmeasurements at several incident energy in direct kinematics: 6 beam energies were\ntried for Se+Pb at GSI in the search of element 116 [1] whereas an excitation energy\nrange of 12 MeV or more can be covered with a single incident energy in inverse\nkinematics.\n\n4.2\n\nUse of\n\n76\n\nGe32 beam\n\nThe main interest of using 76 Ge beam is the direct cold fusion production of the\nelement 273 110 using a 198 Pt target [9]. Indeed, this isotope has been observed in\n3 events only through the decay of element 277 112 and possibly 3 events by direct\nproduction in hot fusion reaction (34 S+244 Pu=273 110+5n). A very large range of\n\u03b1-decay energies, from 9.18 to 11.17 MeV with lifetimes from 0.11 to 170 msec have\nbeen observed. What we propose is to make a precise \u03b1-spectroscopy of this isotope\nsince the population of different levels (especially isomeric states) may be due to\noverreaching the deformed shell N=162. This would require a \"large\" number of\nevents.\nA more general interest for the 76 Ge beam is provided by the accessible region\nof production. Indeed, it makes possible, using targets ranging from 192 Os76 to\n205 Tl , to produce elements 108 to 113 heavier by two neutrons (except for element\n81\n111) than the isotopes produced using Pb/Bi targets with beams ranging from 48 Ca\nto 70 Zn [1]. Clearly, comparing with Pb/Bi based reactions, the entrance channel\nis more symmetric and there are no closed shells, the cross sections will be then\nreduced. But on the other hand, the accessible compound nuclei are richer by 2\nneutrons (except for element 111) and this will be in favour of the cross sections.\nAn estimation of the reduction factors (see Figure 3) can be made using the\ncompound nucleus 220 Th produced via different entrance channels having similar\nBass barriers [4, 10, 11, 12]: Ar18 +Hf72 and Zn30 +Nd60 systems have no closed\nshells and the more symmetric system has a cross section smaller by a factor 14.\nAssuming a steady variation with the charge asymmetry, the expected cross sections\nfor Ca20 +Yt70 and Zr40 +Sn50 are estimated. The actual cross sections are much\nhigher, by a factor 6 and 23 respectively, due to the role of the closed shells [13].\nThese factors may now be used to estimate the reduction factor which applies when\nthe same CN is formed on 76 Ge based reactions in comparison with Pb/Bi based\nreactions. The loss of shell effects is estimated to reduce the cross section by one\norder of magnitude (represented by a solid arrow in Figure 3). At Z=106, the\ndecrease of asymmetry reduces the cross section by a factor about 12 (represented\n\n6\n\n\fby a dashed arrow in Figure 3) whereas this asymmetry disappears for 76 Ge+208 Pb\nreaction producing element 114.\nAn estimation of the gain in the cross section due to the neutron richness can be\nmade also considering the Th isotopes. Detailed measurements show that 2 more\nneutrons in the CN increase the residue cross section by a factor 9 [12]. As seen in\nFigure 3, the gain for Z=110 using 64 Ni beam instead of 62 Ni is in the order of 5.\nIn our estimation for 76 Ge beam, we consider an average factor of 7 (represented by\na solid arrow on Figure 3). Then, the estimated cross sections are represented by\nsolid crosses. They are smaller than the Pb/Bi based cross sections.\n\n4.3\n\nStudy of the structure of the Super Heavy Elements\n\nA new experimental program is proposed at GANIL [14] on the study of transfermium isotopes by the use of spectroscopic information in order to have a better\nunderstanding of their shell structure. This program is going to start with the \u03b1, \u03b3\nand electron spectroscopy of 251 Md and 251 Fm. 251 Md is populated by the \u03b1-decay\nof 255 Lr produced in the 2 neutrons channel of the 48 Ca+209 Bi fusion evaporation\nreaction. The 251 Md should decay with less than 10% by \u03b1-decay on 247 Es and with\nmore than 90% by EC on 251 Fm. Since the ground state parity and spin of the\nfirst level of 251 Fm are known, ground state of 251 Fm and possibly of 255 Lr could be\ndetermined. The experimental setup will be adapted with a tunnel of Si detectors\nto detect conversion-electrons and a set of Ge clover detectors from Exogam will be\nadded in a close geometry.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to acknowledge all the technicians and engineers from mechanics, detector and electronic groups who made possible this experimental program, especially at LPC Caen, GANIL and Saclay.
