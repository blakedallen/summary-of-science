KGaA, Weinheim\n\n1 Introduction\nIn recent years the first robotic telescopes came to operation\nand many of them already routinely collect data without\nhuman interaction. A natural next step in automated astronomy is the integration of these telescopes into a network. A\nnetwork of distributed telescopes can perform new types of\nobservations which cannot be accomplished with individual\ninstruments. Important examples include continuous longterm monitoring of objects independent of day and night\ncycles and weather, rapid response to transient objects and\nmultiwavelength campaigns.\nThe Astrophysical Institute Potsdam (AIP) currently\noperates five robotic telescopes and is pursuing their integration into a network. This effort is supported by\nAstroGrid-D, which is the German astronomy community\ngrid. Here grid refers to a distributed network of loosely\ncoupled resources with a common, user-friendly infrastructure. The AstroGrid-D collaboration consists of 20 people\nfrom fourteen German institutes under the leadership of\nthe AIP. The project has been funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) for a period of\nthree years. The network will be built on grid technology,\nwhich provides an ideal framework for a robotic telescope\nnetwork. For example, it provides solutions for the management of Virtual Organization1, grid resources, computational jobs and observation, data and metadata. In addition, it allows the immediate access to computational and\nstorage resources for data analysis.\n\n\u22c6 Corresponding author: fbreitling@aip.de\n\n2 Robotic telescopes of the AIP\nWith control of five robotic telescopes the AIP provides the\nnecessary hardware for the development and operation of a\ntelescope network. The telescopes are RoboTel, STELLA-I\nand II, Wolfgang and Amadeus.\n\u2013 RoboTel is located at the AIP. It is a 0.8 m telescope\nequipped with a CCD camera for imaging and photometry. In addition to its science core-program, half\nof the observation time is reserved for schools and universities. The remaining observation time is dedicated\nto testing of new instruments, software and methods for\nthe STELLA-I and II telescopes.\n\u2013 The STELLA robotic observatory is located at Iza\u00f1a\nobservatory in Tenerife, Spain. It consists of two 1.2 m\ntelescopes, STELLA-I and STELLA-II. STELLA-I is\nequipped with a spectrograph and has been operating\nsince May 2006. STELLA-II will be equipped with\nan imaging photometer. Its commissioning starts at the\nend of 2007. Scientific objectives are: Doppler imaging,\nthe search for extrasolar planets, spectroscopic surveys\nand support observations for simultaneous observations\nwith larger facilities.\n\u2013 Wolfgang and Amadeus (Strassmeier et al. 1997) are located at the Fairborn Observatory in Arizona. They are\ntwo 0.75 m telescopes equipped with photomultipliers\nfor photometry. The scientific objectives are the participation in multi-site observing campaigns and studies of\nvariability timescales and life times of starspots, requiring monitoring of stars over periods of years.\nFurther details regarding RoboTel and STELLA can be\nfound in Granzer (2006) and Strassmeier et al. (2004).\n\n1\n\nIn grid computing, a Virtual Organization defines a collaboration of\nusers with same access rights to grid resources.\n\nc 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\n\n\f344\n\nF. Breitling, T. Granzer & H. Enke: Grid integration of robotic telescopes\n\nFig. 1: Grid architecture of the robotic telescope network. Telescope servers, scheduler and the information service \"Stellaris\" are the\nmain components. The management of observation requests is done through the Globus Toolkit and using RTML. Metadata is submitted\nin RDF to Stellaris and retrieved using the SPARQL query language.\n\n3 Grid architecture\n\nmeters\nhttp://www.rtml.org/#units\n\nThe grid architecture of AstroGrid-D consists of three main\ncomponents which are linked through the internet: the telescope servers, a scheduler and the information service as\nshown in Fig. 1.\nThe telescope server is a computer providing a robotic\ncontrol system (SCS in Fig. 1) for a telescope. Therefore it\nis located at the observatory. The scheduler compiles schedules for network observations, taking into account the monitoring information on the status of each individual telescope (including weather and engineering data). Some aspects regarding scheduling are discussed in Granzer et al.\n(2007). The information service stores and provides metadata of the entire telescope network. It plays a central role\nfor monitoring, scheduling and data access. It can be run at\na computer center.\nThe submission of observation requests and access to\nnew data is provided by the grid middleware: AstroGridD uses the Globus Toolkit (Foster 2006) commands (such\nhttp://www.rtml.org/#Location\nas globusrun-ws) of the Grid Resource and Allocation\nManager (WS GRAM) . The AstroGrid-D information service is called \"Stellaris\" (H\u00f6gqvist, R\u00f6blitz & Reinefeld\n2007). It is a development of the project.\nFor the information exchange the AstroGrid-D architecture uses two protocols: the \"Remote Telescope Markup\nLanguage\" (RTML, Hessman 2006) and the \"Resource Description Format\" (RDF 2007). RTML is an XML format\nfor the description of telescope metadata, such as observation requests, observation schedules, source catalogs, telescope hardware and weather information. RDF is a standard for storing information. It is derived from graph theory\nand represents information in triples as subject, predicate,\n\ngenid:UDXDpDKEw34288\n\n2480\n\nhttp://www.rtml.org/#Height\ndegrees\nhttp://www.rtml.org/#units\n\ngenid:UDXDpDKEw34287\n\nhttp://www.rtml.org/#value\n\n-16.509722\n\nhttp://www.rtml.org/#EastLongitude\n\ngenid:UDXDpDKEw34285\n\nhttp://www.rtml.org/#Latitude\nhttp://www.rtml.org/#name\n\ngenid:UDXDpDKEw34286\n\nhttp://www.rtml.org/#units\nhttp://www.rtml.org/#value\n\ndegrees\n\nhttp://www.rtml.\nIzana Observatory, Teneriffa, Spain\n\n28.3\nhttp://www.rtml.org/#NumColumns\n\nFig. 2: Partial RDF graph of the static metadata of the robotic telescope STELLA-I.

Fig. 2 shows part of a RDF graph representing the\nstatic metadata of the STELLA-I telescope. The RDF/XML\nand Notation 3 formats exist as RDF representations. Since\nWiFSIP\nhttp://www.rtml.org/#valuefrom RTML to\nStellaris uses RDF exclusively, a conversion\nRDF became necessary, in order to store RTML metadata.\nSuch a conversion has been developed using a XSL genid:UDXDpDKEw34273\ntransformation (XSLT 2007). The XSLT (rtml2rdf.xsl 2007) is\nthe first open source transformation of arbitrary XML documents into RDF/XML. The retrieval of informationgenid:UDXDpDKEw34272\nfrom\nStellaris is accomplished using\nSPARQL (2007), the query\noptical\nhttp://www.rtml.org/#Filter\nlanguage for RDF.\nhttp://www.rtml.org/#value\n\nc 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Nachr. / AN (2008)\n\n345\n\n4 User interfaces\nUser interaction with the network is necessary for monitoring and controlling. Three interfaces have been developed\nand are discussed below.\nStellaris provides a user interface for SPARQL queries.\nIt is accessed through a web browser as shown in Fig. 3.\nIf the example query is submitted, Stellaris returns a geographic location of the available telescopes sorted by altitude. In addition all SPARQL queries can be executed via\nthe command line and scripts using the \"Redland Language\nBindings\" (librdf 2007).\nA second web browser user interface is the Telescope\nMap (Telescope Map 2007) shown in Fig. 4. It is based\non Google Maps (Google Maps 2007) and shows locations\nof observatories by markers. Selection of these markers\nprovides additional information such as the available telescopes and their states. This map is useful for monitoring\nof network status and observation, in particular because additional information can be added.\nA third web browser user interface for time-based information is the Grid Timeline (2007) shown in Fig. 5.\nIt can be considered as complementary to the Telescope\nMap. It uses the service of Simile (2007), which provides a\nDHTML-based AJAXy widget for visualizing timing information. The Grid Timeline is currently used for job monitoring and can therefore be easily applied to monitoring of\nrobotic observations.\n\n5 Conclusion\nFive robotic telescopes are operated by the AIP and are prepared for network integration. An architecture for the integration of these telescopes to a network using grid technology has been developed within AstroGrid-D and its main\ncomponents are available. RTML metadata of telescopes\nand observations can be provided to, and received from, the\ninformation service. User interfaces are available for easy\naccess to this information.\n\n6 Outlook\nThe next steps will be the implementation of the Globus\njob management WS GRAM and the development of the\nscheduler. Then the network can undergo testing, conduct\nits first observations and finally participate in campaigns\nwith other telescopes.\nAcknowledgements.
