Recently, it has been shown that classical Density Functional\nTheory (DFT) can give quantitatively accurate results for many inhomogeneous systems\nincluding the structure and surface tension of the liquid-vapor interface, confined fluids near\nwalls, in slit pores[1] and in small cavities[2] and of liquid-vapor nucleation[3]. While these\nresults confirm that DFT can be a useful tool for making quantitatively accurate calculations,\nthey provide limited physical insight due to the complexity of the DFT models and the need\nfor extensive numerical calculations.\nOne simplification of DFT is to relate it to more physically-inspired descriptions of inhomogeneous systems. The oldest, and in many contexts most important, such model is\nthe squared-gradient approximation (SGA) that dates back to van der Waals[4, 5] and has\nbeen re-invented and exploited in many different circumstances, most notably by Landau in\nthe context of phase transitions[6] and by Cahn and Hilliard[7] for the description of interfaces. Evans established the link whereby SGA is an approximation to more fundamental\nDFT[8] and this link has more recently been refined and systematized[9\u201311]. Despite this\njustification for SGA, it nevertheless has the reputation of giving only a qualitative, at best\nsemi-quantitative, approximation to real systems[12]. One result reported here is that SGA\nbased on DFT can in fact be surprisingly accurate.\nIf DFT can be well approximated by SGA, then a substantial reduction of complexity\nhas been achieved. However, for most applications, SGA must also be solved numerically.\nNo matter what details go into the models, this fundamentally involves solving for the\nspatially-varying density which minimizes the free energy. A second development presented\nhere is the use of piecewise-linear approximations for the density profiles. In the simplest\ncase, this involves approximating the interface between two bulk phases as a linear function.\nThe calculation can be systematically improved by replacing the single linear function by\na sequence of linear functions, or links, so that the true profile is obtained in the limit\nof the number of links going to infinite. It is shown that the simplest single-link profile\nprovides a rather accurate approximation to the numerical solution of the SGA with the\nbenefit of giving nearly analytic expressions for surface tensions and interfacial width of\nplanar interfaces and of interfacial width, surface tension and Tolman length for spherical\n2\n\n\fclusters. An additional benefit is that by reducing the DFT integral theory to a simple\nalgebraic model, it gives a systematic link between DFT and Classical Nucleation Theory\n(CNT).\nFinally, the algebraic model for spherical clusters is used to study the nucleation pathway\nfor homogeneous liquid-vapor nucleation. A first method is to minimize the free energy\nsubject to constraints such as fixed number of atoms in the cluster or fixed radius of the\ncluster. It is found these and other constraints are all problematic and fail to give a consistent\npicture of homogeneous nucleation. An alternative method is the construction of steepestdescent paths in density space linking the transition state (i.e. the critical cluster) to the\nbulk liquid and bulk vapor free energy minima[13]. This is found to give a simple and\nplausible description of the nucleation pathway.\nIn the next Section, the SGA is formulated based on the quantitatively accurate ModifiedCore Van der Waals model DFT. The result is an SGA model for fluids that requires only\nthe bulk equation of state and the interaction potential as input. To the extent that the\nequation of state can be accurately approximation by, say, thermodynamic perturbation\ntheory, only the interaction potential need be specified. The application to planar interfaces\nand for spherical clusters and the piecewise-linear approximation are also discussed. In the\nthird Section, this model is used to explore liquid-vapor nucleation. First, the connection\nwith the ideas that underlie Classical Nucleation Theory is made. There, different methods\nof formulating the problem of the determination of the nucleation pathway are described and\ntheir relative merits compared. The fourth Section gives a comparison of the SGA and the\nanalytic models to computer simulation of both planar interfaces and clusters. The paper\nends with a discussion of the results.\n\nII.\n\nTHEORY\n\nA.\n\nSquared-gradient approximation\n\nDensity Functional Theory is an approach to equilibrium statistical mechanics which is\nformulated in the grand-canonical ensemble at constant temperature, T , chemical potential,\n\u03bc, and volume V . The fundamental object is the local number density \u03c1 (r)[8, 14, 15]. It\ncan be shown that there exists a functional of the local density, \u03a9 [\u03c1], having the property\n3\n\n\fthat it is minimized by the equilibrium density function and that its value at this minimum\nis the grand-potential for the system. It can be written as\nZ\n\n\u03a9 [\u03c1] = F [\u03c1] +\n\n(\u03c6 (r) \u2212 \u03bc) \u03c1 (r) dr\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c6 (r) is any external field that may act on the system and where F [\u03c1] is independent\nof the field but otherwise unknown except for special cases such as the ideal gas for which\nFid [\u03c1] = kB T\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1 (r) (ln \u03c1 (r) \u2212 1) dr\n\n(2)\n\nwhere kB is Boltzmann's constant. When evaluated at the equilibrium density, F [\u03c1] is the\nintrinsic Helmholtz free energy. Minimization of \u03a9 [\u03c1] gives the Euler-Lagrange equation\n\u03b4F [\u03c1]\n+ \u03c6 (r) \u2212 \u03bc = 0\n\u03b4\u03c1 (r)\n\n(3)\n\nA key result used to guide the formation of models is that the excess functional Fex [\u03c1] =\nF [\u03c1] \u2212 Fid [\u03c1] is related to the two-body direct correlation function via\nc (r1 , r2 ; [\u03c1]) = \u2212\n\n\u03b4 2 \u03b2Fex [\u03c1]\n\u03b4\u03c1 (r1 ) \u03b4\u03c1 (r2 )\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b2 = 1/kB T . By definition, a bulk fluid is a system with constant equilibrium density,\n\u03c1 (r) = \u03c1 in which case F [\u03c1] = F (\u03c1) is the usual Helmholtz free energy function for the\nfluid.\nIt can be shown[11] that a systematic expansion of F [\u03c1] takes the form\n\u001b\nZ \u001a\n1\n2\nF [\u03c1] =\nf (\u03c1 (r)) + K (\u03c1 (r)) (\u2207\u03c1 (r)) + ... dr\n2\nV\nwhere f (\u03c1) =\n\n1\nV\n\n(5)\n\nF (\u03c1) is the Helmholtz free energy per unit volume of the homogeneous\n\nsystem, the ellipses indicate higher order terms in the gradients and the coefficient of the\nsecond order term is\n1\n\u03b2K (\u03c1(r)) =\n6V\n\nZ\n\n2\nc (r12 ; \u03c1(r)) r12\ndr1 dr2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere c (r12 ; \u03c1) = c (r1 , r2 ; \u03c1) is the translationally invariant direct correlation function of\nthe bulk state. The gradient expansion is thus seen as a link between the properties of the\nbulk state - which are generally accessible - and those of the inhomogeneous state which\nare generally much more difficult to determine. Truncating the expansion at second order\n4\n\n\fgives the Squared-Gradient Approximation (SGA). Substituting into Eq.(3) and taking the\nexternal potential to be zero gives\n1\n\u2207 * K (\u03c1 (r)) \u2207\u03c1 (r) \u2212\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c9 (\u03c1 (r))\nK (\u03c1 (r)) (\u2207\u03c1 (r))2 \u2212\n=0\n\u2202\u03c1 (r)\n\u2202\u03c1 (r)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03c9 (\u03c1) = f (\u03c1) \u2212 \u03bc\u03c1 is the grand potential per unit volume.\n\nTo implement the theory, two elements are necessary: the Helmholtz free energy and the\ndirect correlation function of the bulk system. These are not independent: the equation\nof state is easily calculated from the DCF via the compressibility equation as discussed\nbelow. For realistic potentials, the DCF can be calculated using liquid state theory such as\nthe Percus-Yevick or the HNC approximations. However, when dealing with an interfacial\nsystem, the density typically varies a lot: for a liquid-vapor interface it obviously spans the\nrange from (dense) liquid to (low density) vapor. In particular, it passes through densities\nthat lie in the two-phase region of the bulk phase diagram and liquid-state theories often\ndo not have solutions in those regions. While methods of circumventing this problem by\nmeans of e.g. interpolation have been proposed (see e.g. Ref.[12]) this remains a problematic\nissue. Of course, this is an issue facing all DFT's since the free energy functional is always\nrelated to the DCF so that it might be suspected that a successful DCF would imply some\nmeans around this problem. The Modified-Core Van der Waals model DFT is based on a\nsimple approximation to the DCF and gives good results for a wide variety of interfacial\nsystems[1, 3]. The idea behind it is to begin with the simplest Van der Waals model whereby\nthe DCF is approximated as that of a hard-sphere system with a mean-field treatment of\nthe attractive tail of the interaction,\ncV DW (r12 ; \u03c1) = cHS (r12 ; \u03c1, d) \u2212 \u03b2v (r12 ) \u0398 (r \u2212 d)\n\n(8)\n\nwhere v(r) is the molecular pair interaction potential, d is the effective hard-sphere diameter,\ncHS (r1 , r2 ; \u03c1, d) is the hard-sphere DCF and \u0398(x) = 1 for x > 0 and zero otherwise. Because\nof the relation between the DCF and the excess free energy of the uniform bulk fluid,\nZ\nZ \u03c12\nZ Z\n1 \u03c1\n\u03b2fex (\u03c1\u0304) \u2261 \u03b2f (\u03c1) \u2212 \u03b2fid (\u03c1) = \u2212\nd\u03c12\nd\u03c11\nc (r12 ; \u03c11 ) dr1 dr2 ,\nV 0\n0\n\n(9)\n\nthis implies a rather inaccurate equation of state. Furthermore, it is discontinuous at the\nhard-sphere boundary. To address both of these problems, a linear correction is added to\nthe core region giving the full approximation[16]\n\u0010\nr\u0011\n\u0398 (d \u2212 r) \u2212 \u03b2v (r12 ) \u0398 (r \u2212 d)\nc (r12 ; \u03c1) = cHS (r12 ; \u03c1, d) + b0 + b1\nd\n5\n\n(10)\n\n\fThe coefficients b0 and b1 depend on both density and temperature and are chosen to reproduce a given equation of state and to make the DCF continuous. This has been shown\nto give a rather good approximation for dense fluids[16]. At low density, one has the exact\nresult\nlim c (r12 ; \u03c1) = \u2212 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b2v(r12 )\n\n\u03c1\u21920\n\n\u0001\n\n(11)\n\nand is clearly not reproduced by the simple model. This limit can be enforced by generalizing\nto\n\u0010\nr\u0011\n\u0398 (d \u2212 r)\nc (r12 ; \u03c1) = cHS (r12 ; \u03c1, d) + (c (r12 ; 0) \u2212 cHS (r12 ; 0)) + b0 + b1\nd\n\n(12)\n\nwhich also gives a reasonable approximation. However, as most properties are insensitive to\nthe low-density limit of the DCF, it is more convenient and not much less accurate to work\nwith the simpler approximation given above.\nAssuming the hard-core diameter is chosen to be independent of density, the corecorrection coefficients are fixed by the requirements that the model reproduce the given\nbulk equation of state, f (\u03c1\u0304), and that the DCF be continuous giving\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ \u221e\n1\n\u22022\n\u22022\n1\n3\nb0 + b1 + 4\u03c0\nf (\u03c1) = 2 fHS (\u03c1) \u2212 4\u03c0d\n\u03b2v (r) r 2 dr\n\u2202\u03c12\n\u2202\u03c1\n3\n4\nd\n\n(13)\n\ncHS (d\u2212 ; \u03c1, d) + b0 + b1 = \u2212\u03b2v (d)\nAs shown in Appendix A, using common models for the hard-sphere DCF, the final result\nfor the SGA coefficient takes the simple form\n\u0001 d2 \u2202 2\n\u03c0d5\n2\u03c0\nK=\u2212\na3 \u03c1d3 \u2212\n2 \u03b2fex (\u03c1) +\n180\n15 \u2202\u03c1\n45\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n3r 5 \u2212 2d2 r 3\n\nd\n\n\u0001 d\u03b2v (r)\ndr\ndr\n\n(14)\n\nwhere a3 (\u03c1d3 ) depends on the particular hard-sphere model used (explicit expressions are\ngiven in Appendix A). However, since the coefficient of a3 (\u03c1) is so small, this term contributes only about 1% to the over-all value of K and can usually be safely neglected. Thus,\nin this model, the SGA coefficient is a relatively simple function of the hard-sphere diameter, the potential and the equation of state. While any reasonable value for the hard-sphere\ndiameter could be used, the calculations presented below are based on the Barker-Henderson\nformula[14, 17],\nd=\n\nZ\n\nr0\n\n(1 \u2212 exp (\u2212\u03b2v (r))) dr,\n0\n\nwhere r0 is the smallest solution of v (r0 ) = 0.\n6\n\n(15)\n\n\fB.\n\nPlanar and spherical interfaces\n\nA stable planar interface can only exist when the liquid and vapor are at conditions\nof coexistence so that the value of the chemical potential is \u03bccoex and the bulk liquid and\nvapor densities are \u03c1l,coex and \u03c1v,coex respectively. (All of these quantities are temperaturedependent.) Then, one can impose a density profile that varies in only one dimension, \u03c1 (z)\nso that Eq.(7) becomes\nd\nd\n1\nK (\u03c1 (z)) \u03c1 (z) \u2212\ndz\ndz\n2\n\n\u0012\n\nd\nK (\u03c1 (z))\nd\u03c1 (z)\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nd\n\u03c1 (z)\ndz\n\n\u00132\n\n\u2212\n\nd\u03c9 (\u03c1 (z))\n=0\nd\u03c1 (z)\n\n(16)\n\nAssuming that the density takes the value of the bulk liquid and vapor far from the boundary,\nand noting that \u03c9 (\u03c1l,coex ) = \u03c9 (\u03c1c,coex ) \u2261 \u03c9coex the profile equation can be integrated to get\n\u0012\n\n\u2202\n\u03c1 (z)\nK (\u03c1 (z))\n\u2202z\n\n\u00132\n\n= 2 (\u03c9 (\u03c1 (z)) \u2212 \u03c9coex )\n\n(17)\n\nThis allows the excess free energy, hereafter referred to as the \"surface tension\", to be\nevaluated as\n\u03a9 \u2212 \u03a9coex\n=\nA\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1l,coex\n\n\u03c1v,coex\n\np\n\n2 (\u03c9 (\u03c1) \u2212 \u03c9coex ) K (\u03c1)d\u03c1\n\n(18)\n\nwhile the actual profile must be obtained by integrating Eq.(17) numerically.\nAway from coexistence, a planar interface is unstable. In this case, it is more pertinent\nto study clusters since an unstable phase will transform to a stable phase by the formation\nand subsequent growth of a critical cluster. Assuming spherical symmetry, the equation for\na (meta-)stable profile becomes\ndK (\u03c1 (r)) d\n1\n1 d2\nr\u03c1 (r) +\n\u03c1 (r) \u2212\nK (\u03c1 (r))\n2\nr dr\ndr\ndr\n2\n\n\u0012\n\nd\nK (\u03c1 (r))\nd\u03c1 (r)\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n\u00132\nd\nd\u03c9 (\u03c1 (r))\n\u03c1 (r) \u2212\n=0\ndr\nd\u03c1 (r)\n(19)\n\nand this does not admit of an exact quadrature. The only nontrivial solution will correspond\nto the critical cluster in which the density near the origin will be close to that of the stable\nphase, while the bulk (i.e. the density far from the origin) will be that of the unstable phase.\n\nC.\n\nAnalytic approximations\n\nAn alternative to solving these equations numerically is to assume some ansatz for the\ndensity, \u03c1 (r) = \u03c1 (r; \u0393), where the quantity on the right has a specified spatial dependence,\n7\n\n\fe.g. a sigmoidal function for the case of a planar interface, and where \u0393 represents a collection\nof parameters (e.g. the width and center of the sigmoidal function). In fact, this procedure\nwas been used for the planar interface by Telo da Gama and Evans[18] and, recently, for\ndroplets by Ghosh and Ghosh[19]. Then, rather than solving Eq.(7) to get the profile,\none substitutes the ansatz into the expression for \u03a9 [\u03c1] and extremizes the free energy with\nrespect to the parameters \u0393. For most cases, this will still involve numerical calculations\nhowever more progress is possible if one assumes the simplest reasonable approximation\nwhich is a piecewise-continuous profile. Thus, for the planar profile, one can try\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u03c1\u2212\u221e , z < \u2212 w2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u03c1 (z) = \u03c1\u2212\u221e + (\u03c1\u221e \u2212 \u03c1\u2212\u221e ) z+w/2\n, \u2212 w2 < z < w2\nw\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u03c1\u221e , w2 < z\n\n(20)\n\nThere are three parameters characterizing this profile: the densities \u03c1\u00b1\u221e on either side of the\ninterface and the width of the interface. The profile is continuous and differentiable except\nat z = \u00b1 w2 but this is sufficient to allow evaluation of the free energy. It is easy to see that\nthe minimization of the free energy for the case that the volume is very large requires that\n\u2202f (\u03c1\u2212\u221e )\n\u2202f (\u03c1\u221e )\n=\n=\u03bc\n\u2202\u03c1\u221e\n\u2202\u03c1\u2212\u221e\n\n(21)\n\nso that a non-trivial interface is only possible at coexistence in which case one of the densities\nmust be that of the coexisting liquid and the other that of the coexisting vapor.

However, in the present case,\none has analytic expressions as well for the entire profile, including the width which can be\nwritten as\n\n(\u03c1\u221e \u2212 \u03c1\u2212\u221e )2 K\n\u03b3\n=\nw=\n2 (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9coex )\n\u03b3\n\n(27)\n\ngiving a simple relation between the interfacial width, the SGA coefficient and the surface\ntension.

In fact, if the density dependence of K(\u03c1) is weak, as will be seen to be the case\nfor a simple fluid, then the approximation K(\u03c1) \u2192 K\u0304 should be adequate thus giving an\neven simpler expression for the gradient coefficient based solely on the interaction potential.\nOne can make a similar ansatz for the spherical cluster,\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u03c10 , r < R\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u03c1 (r) = \u03c10 + (\u03c1\u221e \u2212 \u03c10 ) r\u2212R\n, R<r <R+w\nw\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u03c1\u221e , R + w < r\n\n(29)\n\nso that, with \u03a9\u221e \u2261 V \u03c9(\u03c1\u221e ) and \u2206\u03a9 \u2261 \u03a9 \u2212 \u03a9\u221e ,\n\u2206\u03a9 =\n\n4\u03c0 3\nR \u2206\u03c9\n3\n+4\u03c0R2 w \u03c9 0 + 2\u03c9 1\n\n\u0010w\u0011\nR\n\n+ \u03c92\n\n\u0010 w \u00112\nR\n\n+\n\n(\u03c1\u221e \u2212 \u03c10 )2\n2w 2\n\n!\u0012\n\n(30)\n!\n\u0010w\u0011\n\u0010 w \u00112 \u0013\n+ K2\nK 0 + 2K 1\nR\nR\n\nwhere V is the total volume, the density moments of the bulk free energy and SGA coefficient\nare defined as\n\u0012\n\u0013n\nZ \u03c1\u221e\n\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c10\n1\n(\u03c9 (\u03c1) \u2212 \u03c9 (\u03c1\u221e ))\nd\u03c1\n\u03c9 n (\u03c1\u221e , \u03c10 ) =\n\u03c1\u221e \u2212 \u03c10 \u03c10\n\u03c1\u221e \u2212 \u03c10\n\u0012\n\u0013n\nZ \u03c1\u221e\n\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c10\n1\nK (\u03c1)\nd\u03c1\nK n (\u03c1\u221e , \u03c10 ) =\n\u03c1\u221e \u2212 \u03c10 \u03c10\n\u03c1\u221e \u2212 \u03c10\n\n(31)\n\nNote that the density arguments have been suppressed (i.e. \u03c9 0 \u2261 \u2206\u03c90 (\u03c1\u221e , \u03c10 ), etc.), that\n\u2206\u03c9 = \u03c9 (\u03c10 ) \u2212 \u03c9 (\u03c1\u221e ), and that the zeroth-order moment \u03c9 0 (\u03c1\u221e , \u03c10 ) is the same as the\n9\n\n\fquantity \u03c9 (\u03c1\u221e , \u03c10 ) characterizing the planar interface. Equation (30) is completely general\nand involves no assumptions regarding the size of the cluster.\nAs shown in AppendixB, these piecewise-linear approximations can be systematically\nextended to include an arbitrary number of linear \"links\" in the profile, each with a separate width and slope. It is expected that as the number of links grows, the profile will\nbecome closer and closer to the true, free-energy minimizing profile so that this provides\nan alternative form of solution of the unconstrained problem. As will be noted below, only\na few links are needed to obtain high accuracy in the excess free energy. This therefore\nprovides a systematic, and computationally cheap, alternative to the direct solution of the\nEuler-Lagrange equation for the profile.\n\nIII.\n\nLIQUID-VAPOR NUCLEATION: EXTENDING CLASSICAL NUCLEATION\n\nTHEORY\n\nFor a given temperature, there is a unique value of the chemical potential at which the\nliquid and vapor phases can coexist. Any other value of the chemical potential implies\nstability of one phase over that of the other. In this Section, the transformation from the\nmetastable phase to the stable phase is discussed based on the piecewise-linear model for\nthe spherical cluster. The reason for concentrating on this model, rather than solving the\nSGA equations numerically, is to make contact with Classical Nucleation Theory and to\nshow how it can be extended in a natural way to include non-classical effects. Furthermore,\nthis simplified version of the theory is expected to be useful as a starting point for studying\nmore complex systems.\n\nA.\n\nClassical Nucleation Theory\n\nFor a given value of \u03bc 6= \u03bccoex there is a metastable phase, \u03c1m , and a stable phase, \u03c1s\nand \u03c9 (\u03c1m ) > \u03c9 (\u03c1s ) while \u03c9 \u2032 (\u03c1m ) = \u03c9 \u2032 (\u03c1s ) = 0. The system is initially in the metastable\nstate \u03c1 (r) = \u03c1m and homogeneous nucleation proceeds by the spontaneous formation of a\ncritical cluster. Throughout this discussion, it will be assumed that such clusters are always\nspherical. In CNT, the interface between the two phases is sharp so that the cluster has a\nwell-defined radius, R and, on physical grounds, the free energy of a cluster is assumed to\n10\n\n\fbe given by\n\u03a9CN T\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n4\u03c0 3\n4\u03c0 3\n=\nR \u03c9 (\u03c10 ) + V \u2212\nR \u03c9 (\u03c1\u221e ) + 4\u03c0R2 \u03b3c\n3\n3\n\n(32)\n\nwhere \u03b3c is the planar excess free energy per unit area at coexistence and where the internal\nand external densities, \u03c10 and \u03c1\u221e are to be determined. Extremizing the free energy gives\n\u03c9 \u2032 (\u03c10 ) = \u03c9 \u2032 (\u03c1\u221e ) = 0 showing that the interior and exterior densities are those of the bulk\nstable and metastable phases respectively. Then, since \u03c9 (\u03c1s ) < \u03c9 (\u03c1m ) and \u03b3c > 0, the free\nenergy necessarily has a maximum at the critical radius,\nR\u2217 =\n\n2\u03b3c\n\u03c9 (\u03c1m ) \u2212 \u03c9 (\u03c1s )\n\n(33)\n\ngiving the free energy barrier\n\u03a9\u2217CN T \u2212 \u03a9 (\u03c1m ) =\n\n\u03b3c3\n16\u03c0\n.\n3 (\u03c9 (\u03c1m ) \u2212 \u03c9 (\u03c1s ))2\n\n(34)\n\nThis can then be used to estimate the nucleation rate[20] where, in the course of the analysis,\nEq.(32) is used to determine the number of non-equilibrium clusters of a given size under the\nassumption that the number of clusters of size N =\n\n4\u03c0 3\nR \u03c10\n3\n\nis proportional to the Boltzmann\n\nfactor, exp (\u2212\u03b2\u03a9CN T (N)). Since there is only one variable that can vary between clusters,\ni.e. the radius R, the implied nucleation pathway is simply one of increasing radius.\n\nB.\n\nEnergy-minimized pathways\n\nComparison of Eq.(32) and (30) shows that the CNT expression results from the DFT\nmodel if one takes the limit\n\nw\nR\n\n\u2192 0 with\n\n(\u03c1\u221e \u2212\u03c10 )2\nK0\n2w 2\n\nheld fixed which suggests looking at\n\nthe large R behavior of the DFT model.

In fact,\nas shown below, there is reason to believe that the radius parameter varies non-monotonically\nalong the nucleation pathway and that it cannot be used to parameterize movement along\nthe nucleation pathway: i.e. it is not a good reaction coordinate. Physically, one expects the\ncluster to grow by adding atoms so that the excess number of atoms in the cluster should be\na useful reaction coordinate. However, if one minimizes the model free energy with respect\nto R, w and \u03c10 while holding \u2206N constant, and then again solves perturbatively (now using\n\u01eb = (\u2206N)\u22121/3 as the small parameter) the zeroth order central density is found to be given\nby\n\u03c9 (\u03c100 ) \u2212 \u03c9 (\u03c1\u221e )\n\u2202\u03c9 (\u03c100 )\n=\n\u2202\u03c100\n\u03c100 \u2212 \u03c1\u221e\n12\n\n(41)\n\n\fwhich is physically incorrect since it implies that the final phase will not be the bulk liquid\nat the applied chemical potential. This happens because fixing the number of atoms in\nthe cluster has the effect of changing the chemical potential as can easily be shown by\nformulating the problem with a Lagrange multiplier (see Appendix C).\nA final possibility that suggests itself is to minimize at fixed equimolar radius. This\navoids the issue of altering the chemical potential in the cluster.

Two candidate\npaths were found, one at fixed parameter R and another at fixed equimolar radius. This\nleads to the question as to which prescription is \"correct\" or whether there is a less arbitrary\nmeans of constructing such a description.\nThe process of nucleation of a stable phase from an unstable one is conceptually similar\nto that of a chemical reaction or a structural transition in a finite cluster of molecules.\n13\n\n\fAll of these involve the transition from a higher (free-) energy state to a lower energy\nstate via an energy barrier. In principle, these processes should be described by dynamical\ntheories. For the liquid-vapor transition, this would consist of a hydrodynamic description\nin which the free energy would enter via the local pressure. However, dynamical descriptions\nare computationally expensive and in the spirit of CNT, it is interesting to ask what can\nbe learned simply from knowledge of the free energy functional governing the transition.\nFor example, in CNT the free energy is a function of a single parameter, the radius, and\nthe transition can be viewed as the growth of the radius from R = 0, the homogeneous\nmetastable phase, to R \u2192 \u221e, the homogeneous stable phase. The goal here is to generalize\nthis picture for the case in which there are multiple parameters characterizing the transition,\nas is the case with the piecewise-linear density profile discussed above. It should be noted\nthat the same question can be asked with regard to the SGA free energy functional Eq.(5),\nin which case there is a continuum of parameters, namely the values of \u03c1 (r) for all points r.\nThe standard approach to the descriptions between (meta-) stable states on an energy\nsurface, widely used in the examples cited above[13], involves two parts. The first is the\ndetermination of transition states which are defined as saddle points in the free energy\nsurface for which the Hessian of the (free-)energy function has a single negative eigenvalue.\nThis is a generalization of the concept of the critical cluster in CNT. The second element is\nthe determination of steepest descent pathways through the parameter space. These paths\nstart at the transition state and consist of an initial small movement in the direction of the\neigenvector with the negative eigenvalue. (Actually, there are two paths: one parallel to\nthe eigenvector and the other anti-parallel.) The steepest descent paths are then the most\nefficient paths connecting the transition state to a local minimum - i.e. to a (meta-)stable\nstate and, one expects, are closely related to the most likely paths when the processes is\ndriven by thermal fluctuations. If a model for thermal fluctuations is available, then it is\npossible to define instead a most likely path[21] and of course, kinetic effects may alter the\ndynamics substantially. The steepest-descent paths simply represent the best guess of how\nthe transition will proceed in the absence of dynamical information.\nIn the simple case of liquid-vapor nucleation, one anticipates that there will be a single\ntransition state (the critical cluster) and that the steepest descent path in one direction\nwill lead to the homogeneous metastable phase while that in the other will lead to the\nhomogeneous stable phase. In this case, it is the first part - the path connecting the initial\n14\n\n\fhomogeneous metastable phase to the transition state - which is primarily of interest.\nFor the sake of generality, suppose that the free energy depends on n parameters and let\n\u0393 denote a particular set of those parameters so that for the piecewise linear model, n = 3\nand \u0393 = (\u03c10 , R, w). The transition state is a stationary point so must satisfy\n\u2202\u03a9\n=0\n\u2202\u0393a\nfor all a = 1, ..., n.\ntechniques[22].\n\n(46)\n\nIt can be efficiently located using so-called eigenvalue following\n\nThese are similar to gradient-following minimization techniques except\n\nthat one minimizes in directions corresponding to positive eigenvalues of the Hessian and\nmaximizes in directions corresponding to negative eigenvalues.\nThe steepest descent paths are the quickest paths down the gradient starting at the\ntransition states. The notion of \"quickest\" involves a measure of distance in parameter\nspace which leads to the question of how to define a distance between two points \u03931 and \u03932\ngiven that the individual parameters will not in general even have the same units. Since the\npicture underlying the model is of a transition from one density profile to another, and since\nthe concept of distance used to define the steepest descent directions should be independent\nof the model, it seems most natural to use the Euclidean distance in density space,\nZ\n2\nd [\u03c11 , \u03c12 ] = (\u03c11 (r) \u2212 \u03c12 (r))2 dr\nwhich induces a distance measure in parameter space,\nZ\n2\nd (\u03931 , \u03932 ) = (\u03c1 (r; \u03931 ) \u2212 \u03c1 (r; \u03932 ))2 dr\n\n(47)\n\n(48)\n\nIt is clear that in the distance measure in parameter space is not Euclidean and in fact the\ninduced metric is\ngab (\u0393) =\n\nZ\n\n\u2202\u03c1 (r; \u0393) \u2202\u03c1 (r; \u0393)\ndr.\n\u2202\u0393a\n\u2202\u0393b\n\n(49)\n\nThe steepest descent path for a non-Euclidean geometry is then determined by\ngab\n\nd\u0393b\n\u2202\u03a9\n1\n=q\n\u2202\u03a9 \u2202\u03a9 \u2202\u0393a\nds\ng ab \u2202\u0393\na \u2202\u0393b\n\n(50)\n\nwhere s is the distance in parameter space[13]. As an illustration, the metric for the\npiecewise-linear spherical profile is given explicitly in Appendix D. The procedure is then to\nfind the transition state which occurs at some point \u03930 , to make a small displacement of \u03930\n15\n\n\fin the direction of the unstable eigenvector and then to use this as an initial condition for\nthe solution of the steepest descent equations. Note that the metric, Eq.(49), is only defined\nfor density profiles which are at least continuous which is one reason that one cannot use\nthe discontinuous zero-width profile implicitly assumed in CNT.\nFinally, it should be noted that there are alternatives to this procedure. Techniques such\nas the Nudged Elastic Band[23\u201325] and the String Method[26] are alternative, more heuristic,\nmethods for determining steepest descent pathways. Both require a measure of distance in\nparameter space and so involve the same issues raised here. They are in general much less\ncomputationally demanding than the direct approach described above and have been used to\ndetermine pathways based on the inhomogeneous density, rather than a parameterization as\nused here[3, 27]. The reason for using the present approach is that it seems most in keeping\nwith the spirit of CNT plus the fact that with the simple piecewise-linear models, the direct\nintegration of the steepest descent equations, Eq.(50), is computationally straightforward.\n\nIV.\n\nCOMPARISON OF THEORY AND SIMULATION\n\nTo evaluate the SGA theory and the analytic approximations introduced above, a comparison between the theory and simulations of planar and spherical liquid-vapor interfaces\nwas carried out for a fluid with the Lennard-Jones pair potential\n\u0012\u0010 \u0011\n\u0013\n\u03c3 12 \u0010 \u03c3 \u00116\nv(r) = 4\u01eb\n.\n\u2212\nr\nr\n\n(51)\n\nAll forms of the theory require as input the bulk equation of state. In order to minimize errors\narising from this external input, the empirical Lennard-Jones equation of state of Johnson,\nZollweg and Gubbins (JZG)[28] was used. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the\nJZG equation of state is based on simulations covering a limited range of temperatures and\ndensities with corrections so as to describe the infinite-ranged Lennard-Jones potential while\nall of the simulation results used here are for a finite cutoff. Thus, in all cases, a mean-field\ncorrection was added to the JZG equation of state so as to account for the cutoff[28]. It is\ntherefore expected that the input is most reliable for large cutoffs and becomes increasingly\nunreliable as the cutoff is decreased.\nFigure 1 shows the free energy, density-averaged free energy and its first moment,\n\u2206\u03c9 (\u03c1, \u03c1v ) , \u03c9\u03040 (\u03c1, \u03c1v ) and \u03c9\u03041 (\u03c1, \u03c1v ), for the Lennard-Jones potential with no cutoff for coex16\n\n\fFIG. 1.

Also shown are K (\u03c1), K\u03040 (\u03c1, \u03c1v )\nand K\u03041 (\u03c1, \u03c1v ). The free energy, \u2206\u03c9 (\u03c1, \u03c1v ), has two minima corresponding to the vapor and\nthe liquid states separated by a barrier of about 0.36kB T . The density-averaged free energy\nshows less variation and the first moment is about half as large. The SGA coefficient varies\nrelatively little as a function of density thus showing that it is dominated by the densityindependent potential contributions. As a consequence, the density-averaged value is nearly\nconstant and the first moment is very nearly half as large, K\u03041 (\u03c1, \u03c1v ) \u2243 12 K\u03040 (\u03c1, \u03c1v ), over the\nwhole range of densities. In Fig.2, the same quantities are shown for kB T = 1.2\u01eb = 0.92kB Tc .\nIn this case, the difference between the free energy moments is much less but the SGA coefficient is still dominated by the density-independent contributions.\n\nA.\n\nPlanar interface\n\nAs a first test of the SGA, the profile and excess free energy of the planar liquid-vapor\ninterface at coexistence was calculated for the Lennard-Jones potential truncated at various\n17\n\n\fFIG. 2.

Figure 3 shows the excess free energy per\nunit area, or surface tension, as a function of temperature from the calculations as well\nas that calculated in the piecewise linear model and values obtained from Monte Carlo\nsimulations[29]. The accuracy of the calculations is evident. In fact, the accuracy of the SGA\nappears to rival that of the underlying DFT (see Ref.[1] for comparison). The piecewiselinear approximation always gives higher values of the surface tension, as it must since\nthe SGA result is obtained via an unconstrained minimization of the free energy, but is\nnevertheless very close to the SGA result.\nSome calculated profiles are shown in Fig.4 and compared to simulation data reported\nin Ref.[29]. The SGA profiles are in reasonable agreement with the simulations although\nsome discrepancy is apparent, particularly in the narrowest interfaces. The crudeness of the\npiecewise-linear approximation is apparent; even so, the widths of the interfaces are tracked\nreasonably well as a function of cutoff and temperature.\nTo illustrate the convergence to the exact result as the number of links in the profile\nincreases, calculations were performed while varying the number of links. The results are\nshown in Fig.5 which shows that the simple single-link profile gives an error of about 5%\nand that this decreases to about 0.5% for 10 links.

The symbols are\nthe simulation data and error bars reported in Ref.[29], the full lines are from the SGA calculations\nand the dashed lines are from the piecewise-linear model.\n\nfunction of 1/N gives the exact value.\n\nB.\n\nClusters\n\nSmall clusters pose more of a challenge since there is no bulk region and most, if not all,\nof the atoms in the cluster are affected by the interface. Furthermore, all clusters are out\nof equilibrium except the critical cluster which is in a metastable state. The description of\nunstable clusters will be discussed below: here attention is focussed on the transition states:\ni.e., the critical clusters.\nUsing the SGA, the properties of critical clusters were determined by solving Eq.(7) in a\nspherically symmetric geometry using a relaxation technique[33]. Given an initial guess of\nthe profile not too different from the critical cluster, this method relaxes to the critical cluster\nautomatically. For the analytic model, the eigenvalue-following technique described above\nwas used. The protocol is the same as described in Ref.[3] including a small temperature\n19\n\n\fFIG. 4.\n\n(Color online) Density profiles at the liquid-vapor interface calculated at different\n\ntemperatures and values of the potential cutoff.

Note that following\nRef.[34], supersaturation is defined as the ratio of the vapor pressure to that at coexistence.\nThe SGA is seen to give a good description of the critical clusters, although there are greater\ndifferences from simulation than in the case of the planar profiles. In particular, the SGA\nprofiles have wider interfaces than occurs in the data and the larger profile, corresponding\nto lower supersaturation, has somewhat larger radius than indicated by simulation. Also\nshown are the analytic approximations which give a reasonable approximation to the SGA\nprofiles but which are still wider and therefore compare less well to simulation. To put these\nresults in context, the underlying MC-VDW DFT model on which the present SGA is based\nis in close agreement with the simulated cluster profiles[3].\n20\n\n\fFIG. 5.

The analytic profiles\nagain give reasonable approximations to the SGA. As noted by ten Wolde and Frenkel[34]\nCNT gives good estimates of the cluster size and poorer estimates for the barrier, especially\nat higher supersaturations.\n\nC.\n\nNucleation Pathways\n\nThe steepest descent pathways have been calculated by integrating Eq.(50) for several\nvalues of the supersaturation. Figure 8 shows the excess number of atoms in a cluster as a\nfunction of the distance along the pathway for two cases showing that \u2206N is a monotonic\nfunction of the distance and therefore could serve as a reaction coordinate. Figure 9 illustrates the actual pathways and shows some surprising features. Although the excess number\nof atoms is a monotonic function of the path, the size of the bulk region, parameterized by\n21\n\n\fFIG. 6.

The full\nsymbols are the simulation data from Ref. [34], the full lines were calculated using the SGA, the\ndashed lines are the piecewise-analytic approximation and the open circles are the result of the full\nMC-VDW[3].\n\nR, and the width of the interface, parameterized by w, are both non-monotonic functions\nalong the steepest-descent pathway. The width in particular grows with growing droplet\nsize for small droplets until it reaches a maximum for clusters of about 75 atoms and then\nslowly decreases thereafter. The size of the bulk region shows a local minimum at about\nthe same point as the width has a maximum and is a decreasing function of cluster size for\nsmall clusters of 30 \u2212 75 atoms.\nFigure 9 also shows the minimum energy pathways obtained by minimizing with respect\nto all parameters while holding \u2206N fixed. The fact, noted above, that the inner density is\nincorrect for large \u2206N is evident. However, the critical clusters are accurately determined\nsince they are stationary points with respect to all parameters. This means that any energy\nminimized path, regardless of the constraints, will give the correct critical cluster. For\n22\n\n\fFIG. 7.

[34], the full lines are the result of solving the SGA,\nEq.(19), the dashed-lines are from the piecewise-linear approximation and, for comparison, the\nresults obtained from the full MC-VDW DFT[3] are shown as stars and the CNT result is shown\nas a dashed-dotted line.\n\nsmaller clusters, the fixed-\u2206N paths are in qualitative agreement with the steepest descent\npaths showing the same non-monotonic behavior of both the width and radius. However,\nrather than varying smoothly and continuously as the cluster size goes to zero, it was found\nthat below a certain cluster size, the energy-minimized path jumped discontinuously to a\nsolution consisting of a very low central density, only slightly larger than the gas, and a\nvery large width. This is not an accident: for the small values of \u2206N, there are no energyminimized clusters with liquid-like cores. Calculations of the energy-minimized path at fixed\nequimolar radius gave good agreement with the steepest-descent paths for large clusters, but\n23\n\n\fFIG. 8. (Color online) The excess number of atoms in a cluster as a function of distance along the\nsteepest-descent paths where s = 0 corresponds to the critical cluster. The figure shows the results\nfor the Lennard-Jones potential with a cutoff at 2.5\u03c3 for T = 0.683Tc for two different values of the\nsupersaturation and illustrates the fact that the excess number varies monotonically with distance\nalong the path so that it can sensibly be used as a reaction coordinate.\n\nshow similar unphysical behavior (i.e. the absence of liquid-like cores) beginning at larger\ncluster sizes than for the fixed \u2206N paths. The conclusion is that while energy-minimized\npaths can give qualitative behavior similar to the steepest descent paths, they do not give\na reasonable physical description of the entire nucleation pathway. This is somewhat at\nodds with the recent results of Ghosh and Ghosh[19] who examine energy-minimized paths\nat fixed radius for sigmoidal profiles and who appear to obtain nontrivial minimizations at\nall values of the radius. Perhaps this is simply due the use of different equations of state\nand values of the squared-gradient coefficient or because the piece-wise linear model is too\ncrude. Another possibility is that it is related to the fact that the sigmoidal profile does\nnot enforce the boundary condition that d\u03c1(r)/dr = 0 at r = 0 as do the piecewise-linear\nprofiles used here and so are less constrained. Note that this boundary condition is used\nwhen solving the SGA Euler-Lagrange equations, Eq.(19), for the critical cluster and that\nwithout it, derivatives such as d\u03c1(x, 0, 0)/dx do not exist at x = 0.\n24\n\n\fAnother interesting feature of the steepest-descent pathways is that the the interior density is that of the metastable vapor for very small clusters and increases rapidly as a function\nof cluster size until the cluster reaches about 100 atoms. Since the radius of the bulk region\nnever fully goes to zero, this gives a very different picture of the formation of small clusters\nfrom that implied in CNT. Recall that in the CNT model, small clusters have small radii\nwhile the central density is always that of the bulk. Here, the picture is one of increasing\ndensity in a bulk region that is always of finite extent. Figure 10 shows the equimolar radius\nwhich further emphasizes this difference. Whereas in the CNT model, the equimolar radius\nis equal to the radius of the cluster, and therefore goes to zero for small clusters, here it is a\nfunction of both the radius of the bulk region and the width and in fact is never small than\nabout 2\u03c3. This is very similar to results found using the NEB method and a much more\nsophisticated DFT model[3, 27]. Here, however, the physics behind this behavior is evident.\nAs shown above, the surface free energy is proportional to the difference in densities inside\nand outside the droplet and inversely proportional to the width of the interfacial region.\nIn order to minimize the free energy for small droplets, which is dominated by the surface\ntension contribution, as the size of the droplets decreases, the difference in densities must\ndecrease as well. Since the free energy is inversely proportional to the width, the width\nstabilizes at a finite value and the \u2206N \u2192 0 limit is achieved via \u03c10 \u2192 \u03c1\u221e at finite w giving\na non-zero equimolar radius.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe construction of the Squared-Gradient approximation starting with the ModifiedCore van der Waals model for inhomogeneous fluids has been described. A relatively simple\nexpression for the SGA coefficient was obtained which requires only the equation of state and\ninteraction potential as input. The SGA model was shown to give quantitatively accurate\nsurface free energies and density profiles for planar liquid-vapor interfaces of Lennard-Jones\nfluids as a function of temperature and potential cutoff. Similar comparisons were made\nfor spherical clusters where it was found that the SGA was less accurate than the full DFT\nmodel nevertheless gives reasonable results.\nIt was also shown that the SGA could further be approximated using piecewise-linear\ndensity profiles. This model is of course less accurate in the same examples (planar interfaces\n25\n\n\fFIG. 9.

Aside from\nproviding a rather simple means to explore the solution of the SGA, the main advantage\nof the piecewise-linear model is that it offers a simple bridge between DFT and the ideas\nbehind Classical Nucleation Theory.\nFinally, the use of these tools to construct a description of homogeneous liquid-vapor nucleation was illustrated. The description was based on an analogy to chemical and structural\ntransitions and made use of the transition-state/steepest-descent path methods used in those\nproblems. Interesting non-classical behavior that was observed included the decrease of the\ninterior density and the finite equimolar-radius as the size of the clusters tended to zero.\nBoth effects were linked to the fact that the effective surface tension is density-dependent\n(unlike in CNT), a fact that is immediately evident in the case of the piecewise-linear approximation but that would be harder to isolate in purely numerical calculations using the\nSGA or the original DFT.
