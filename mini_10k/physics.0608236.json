Introduction\nIt is known that the problem of how a mathematical superposition of manifold possibilities\nevolves to become a particular observable actuality, represents the basic unsolved problem of\nmeasurement in quantum mechanics. In some sense it delineates also a basic unsolved question\nof our science and knowledge. In fact, the present quantum problem may be considered the last\nmore modern version of a problematicism and a debate that involved our science and\nphilosophy from the past, starting with Empedocle, Plato and the same Aristotle who first\nconsidered that potentia and actuality are two kinds of reality and that actualities give origin to\npotentia which give origin to actualities. W. Heisenberg evidenced the value of quantum\nmechanics in this Aristotelian basic principle. On the other hand, quantum theory is not able to\nreach adequate evidence on the nature of such potential entities, on their qualification between\ntheir quantum actualizations and, finally, on the same mathematical and physical features\nregulating the transition in our reality from potential to actual entities. The aim of the present\npaper is to move in the framework of a quantum like formulation, giving for the first time a\nmathematical proof of such possible transition from potential to actual entities in our reality and\nsimultaneously describing the mathematical and physical features that characterize such\ntransition.\nBefore to proceed with the mathematical proof, we need to deepen two important questions. The\nfirst relates the nature of the quantum states and the second considers the nature of the spin. We\nretain that this last quantum observable represents the essence of quantum mechanics and\n\n\ftherefore our proof will be based on the utilization at the algebraic level of basic abstract\nelements that, as we shall see, move in direct analogy with the notion of spin.\n2. Some Observations on the Nature of Quantum States.\nLet us start with a preliminary analysis on the notion of quantum state. The problem here is\nwell known. Let us consider a particle, as example an electron, impinging on a screen.\nAccording to quantum mechanics we cannot know where it will hit but we can always assign\nprobabilities to potentialities of the electron to hit at different locations. These are given by the\nwell known wave function or quantum state of the system we have in consideration. At some\ntime, the electron impinges into some point of the screen and since it hits the screen, we have no\nmore a matter of probability. The quantum state has collapsed into some definite point on the\nscreen. The arising question is on the nature of the quantum state. In an epistemic interpretation\nwe consider that the quantum state describes not the system in consideration but our status of\nknowledge about it. In an ontic interpretation we admit instead that the quantum states are ontic\nand this is to say that they describe the system as it is. The point here is to consider an ontic\nnature of the quantum state but the settlement of its definition is paved with conceptual\ndifficulties. Some possibilities to proceed with an ontic interpretation of quantum states were\npreviously explored [1]. However, undoubtedly, it is not so easy to introduce an adequate notion\nof ontic potentialities in our reality. As example, it seems rather an approximation for defect to\nconsider here a superposition state of potentialities meaning that the system can be in two or\nmore states at the same time. In fact, we must remember here that the entity in consideration is a\npotential and not an actual entity. It must be considered to be real, ontologically significant, but\nnot being actual. By the previous definition we ran the risk to consider the coexistence of\npotentialities as an actual like form, that is a superposition of coexisting like actualities and this\nis not what the quantum superposition principle admits. This is one first difficulty. One other\nquestion arises in the following manner. Let us consider two quantum non commuting entities A\nand B. Quantum mechanics tells us that, if one such entity, say A, is actualized, B consequently\nremains an undefined potentiality. In our opinion , this is an ontic holistic process that must\nreceive a proper general, mathematical formalization while instead in this case the traditional\nquantum formalism, based on the Hilbert space formulation, holds only the requirement of\nmutually orthogonal vectors that are representative of the mutual exclusivity of the states. The\nconsequent mutual exclusivity of outcome states is merely an epistemic phenomenon and thus\nontologically insignificant while instead we need in this case an holistic description having a\nfull ontological explanation. This is one of the reasons because we introduce in the following\nsection a quantum like schema, not based as traditionally on quantum linear operators and\nHilbert spaces, but fixed instead on an algebraic structure and its formalization and where the\nauspicated ontological significance of the holistic process regarding at the same time the\nactualization of the entity A and the persisting potentiality of the entity B, is reached through\nthe proof of the theorem 2. Here the notion of holism linking actuality to potentiality seems\nabsolutely necessary. In conclusion, we like more to steer ourselves into a different definition\n[see also 1] considering an ontic superposition of potentialities meaning an ontic holistic\nentanglement where no more independently existing features of potentiality as actual like forms\nmay be identified. In addition, linked coexisting forms of actuality and potentiality must be\nexpected in our reality still in a whole holistic ontological framework. We would also give some\nevidence about such definitions. Let us admit hypothetically an existing system S that may be\nrepresented by an actual state, that we identify by \u03c8 n ,A , and a potential state that is given in a\nmultiplicative manner by \u03c8 n ,P = \u03c6 n ,P X P where here X P is the potential entity, a symbol whose\n\nonly quantum constraint is to be X 2P = 1 so that its potentiality is to be actualized as +1 or -1.\n\u03c6 n ,P represents instead some scalar quantity connected to X P .The time evolution of such system\nis admitted to be given by the following map\n\n\f\u03c8 n +1,A + \u03c6 n +1,P X P = (\u03c8 n ,A + \u03c6 n , P X P )(\u03c8 n ,A + \u03c6 n ,P X P ) = \u03c8 2n , A + \u03c6 2n ,P + 2\u03c8 n ,A \u03c6 n ,A X P\nIn the evolution of such hypothetical system , we have an actualized entity, \u03c8 2n ,A + \u03c6 2n ,P ,which at\nany stage of the evolution experiences both the actual (\u03c8 2n ,A ) and the potential ( \u03c6 2n ,P )\ncontributions. Instead, the potential entity is represented by the term 2\u03c8 n ,A \u03c6 n ,A X p , where the\npotential symbol, X P ,goes on maintaining at each step, its potentiality to be +1 and -1. Finally,\nat some time X P may be considered to randomly assume an actualized value of +1 or of -1\ngiving in this case a final actualized value for the whole evolution process in consideration.\nThis is an example of potential \u2013 actualized process that at last in principle is based on a\nquantum like scheme. As we see, it changes radically our traditional view on dynamics of\nreality. The time evolution of the system starts with the actualized value \u03c8 0,A . However, with\nbasic difference respect to our traditional view on evolution processes, it has also the\npotentiality to be or \u03c8 0,A + \u03c6 0,P or \u03c8 0,A \u2212 \u03c6 0,P . This is an intrinsic potentiality of such evolution\nprocess. In the future steps of the evolution the system maintains its potentialities that at each\nstage will be given directly by the basic mathematical features of the map. An occurring\nactualization of the process randomly at some time will attribute to X P a definite value, or +1\nor -1, and this actualization will enable the evolution process to actualize a final value of the\nevolutive process that will account also of the previously unexpressed (unactualized)\npotentialities.\nConsider another scheme that may be of basic importance in studies on biological dynamics and\nin the non linear analysis of systems.\nLet us assume the following logistic map\nx n +1 = kx n ( x n \u2212 1 )\nIt is known that it represents one of the most investigated deterministic chaotic maps. Its\nproperties of chaotic deterministic behaviour for 3.7 \u2264 k \u2264 4.0 are well known and well\nestablished [2, soon after increase reference number of one]. We may extend such map in a\nquantum like scheme so to give a logistic map with included potential quantum like features. In\nthis case the usual logistic map becomes\nAn +1 + Bn +1 X P = k ( An + Bn X P )( An + Bn X P \u2212 1 )\nAs previously discussed, X P represents the potential entity. We have X P2 = 1 and by\nactualization at some time it may assume a definite numerical value of + 1 or of \u2212 1 . The\nalgebraic principle of identities for algebraic quantities gives the following two maps\nAn +1 = kAn2 + kBn2 \u2212 kAn\nand\nBn +1 X P = ( kAn Bn \u2212 kBn ) X P\nThe first map pertains to the actualized component , An , of such quantum like logistic map . The\nbasic feature is that, at each stage of its evolution, such actualized component experiences the\ninfluence of the potential component by the presence of Bn2 in each stage of its evolution. The\nsecond map pertains instead to the potential component of the given quantum like logistic\nmap, Bn . At each stage of the iteration such potential component also experiences the presence\nof the actualized component by An . We see that our traditional manner to look at the processes\nof our reality, changes radically. Now, potential and actual entities cooperate to give the time\ndynamics of the considered process. As a model we introduce basic quantum like systems and\nmathematically, we propose to consider dynamical systems in Clifford algebras. We will\nexplore in detail such new non linear phenomenology in following papers.\n\n\fWe may also examine more articulated quantum schemes in which the potential contribution,\npreviously expressed by \u03c6 n ,P X P , will be now replaced by a more general term of the form\nF(X 1, P , X 2.P , X 3,P ) where the X i ,P are this time three potential symbols given as example as in\nthe (11) of the following section and realizing in this manner a quantum like scheme in which\nalso the contributions of the non commutativity are taken in consideration.\nIn conclusion, we retain that quantum potentialities, as roughly expressed by the previous\nmodel, find their principal arena in the sphere of the biological matter. In the last section of\nthis paper, we will give some detailed examples of biological themes in which symbolic\npotential entities as X i ,P may be involved. Potentialities may explain their decisive role when\ndiscussing the basic theme of the Neodarwinism that of course was just the object of a recent\ninvestigation in the framework of quantum potentialities [2 to be increased by one]. In this case\nwhat radically changes respect to our traditional manner to conceive evolution is that in classical\nNeodarwinism we have evolution essentially intended as consequence of random variations and\nnatural selection of what is the fittest form. Here we have selection of forms of concrete and\nactual matter. Instead in the case of the evolution model previously introduced and having\npotentialities, we have similarly a final selection of concrete and actual forms but the arena of\nthe possible differentiation is extremely different and, in particular, forms of potentiality this\ntime coexist with forms of actuality, and potentiality contributes to characterize actual forms at\neach stage of the evolution. It is sufficient to look at the previously given relation to convince\nthat we are in fact in presence of a radically new kind of evolution mechanism where, we\nrepeat, forms of potentiality coexist with forms of actuality. The result is in a new structure\nwhich makes possible many more possible and different pathways that result impossible in an\nevolution mechanism based only on actualization. At the same time it is the basic concept of\nreality that changes radically in the sense that in the traditional case it is the concrete and actual\nmatter that constitutes the ontological reference of a basic materialistic instance while instead in\nsuch new case matter must be considered in its potential form to be envisaged in addition to its\nactual form.\n\n3. Observations on the Nature of Spin.\nW. Pauli was the physicist that had a decisive role in the elaboration of the quantum theory of spin.\nInitially, he called the spin a \"two-valued quantum degree of freedom\". On the basis of this\ndefinition, we retain that initially he considered the spin as a kind of physical-logical -informative\nentity linked to matter at the microphysical level. His definition of spin remained initially rather\nvague and uncharacterized until R. Kroning in 1925 suggested that it would be produced by the\nself-rotation of the electron. This was an idea that Pauli initially criticized severely but Kroning's\nview on spin was subsequently supported from G.Uhlenbeck and S. Goudsmit in the same year, and\nfinally Pauli, despite his initial objections to this idea, formalized the theory of spin in 1927,\naccepting to characterize it as self-rotation of a quantum particle. He pioneered the use of the so\ncalled Pauli matrices as a representation of spin operators, and he introduced a two-component\nspinor wave function. His spin-theory was not relativistic. In 1928 P. Dirac described the relativistic\nelectron with a four component spinor, and he found that the spin is a relativistic effect that may be\nidentified by linearization of the Hamiltonian in special relativity [3].\nAt the present we are convinced that the spin represents an entity of Nature whose meaning and role\nare more general, indeed universal, with respect to the rather restrictive interpretation that was\noriginally formulated by Kroning, Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit. We retain that the following examples\nare of basic importance to accept our thesis. Quantum computing has introduced the qubit quantum\nregister. Here a universal unity of information is formulated in quantum mechanical terms and\ninformation no longer results a rather abstract entity but for the first time it is really and tangiblely\nconnected to a material object as an elementary particle. In addition, P. O'Hara [4] obtained that the\nspin is introduced in a natural way into the space-time metric, taking the square root of the metric\n\n\fassociated with space Also other authors, as P. Cordero, C. Teitelboim, and R. Tabensky [5]\nintroduced the spin into relativity but taking the square root of the Hamiltonian. As well as in the\nDirac equation the spin was obtained by linearizing the Hamiltonian of special relativity, in [4] spin\nmatrices were obtained by linearizing not the Hamiltonian of relativity but rather the space-metric\nitself, and this result provided the conclusion in [4] that the spin is intrinsically linked to the\ngeometrical properties of space-time. Such results indicate that the so called spin must be really\nintended as manifestation of a general and universal entity having in Nature an articulated, physical,\ninformative, and logic role. Other interesting evidences of such a conclusion may be reached\nthrough investigation in biology and physiology. Two authors, Hu. Hu and M. Wu, [6], introduced a\ntheory in which the advent of consciousness is intrinsically connected to spin. They formulated a\nspin-mediated consciousness theory based on pan-protopsychism. These authors were able to\ndiscuss a well defined neurophysiological model to support their thesis. Considering the structure\nand the dynamics of the brain, they postulated that the human mind works as follows: The nuclear\nspin ensembles (NSE) in both neural membranes and proteins quantum mechanically process\nconsciousness-related information such that conscious experience emerges from the collapses of\nentangled quantum states of NSE under the influence of the underlying spacetime dynamics. Said\ninformation is communicated to NSE through strong spin-spin couplings by biologically available\nunpaired electronic spins such as those carried by rapidly diffusing oxygen molecules and neural\ntransmitter nitric oxides that extract information from their diffusing pathways in the brain. In turn,\nthe dynamics of NSE has effects through spin chemistry on the classical neural activities such as\naction potentials and receptor functions thus influencing the classical neural networks of brain [6]\nThe authors also gave some supporting evidence to such a formulation introducing indications for\nexperimental verifications.\nAlso recently, [7], we have given direct formulation for a possible quantum mechanical model of\nconsciousness based on the central role of the spin.\nThere is still another important reason to discuss here the real role of spin in biological dynamics.\nThe four bases in RNA sequences C, G, A and U ( or T in DNA) may be formalized by using Pauli\nmatrices. Note that we do not speak here of some physical feature of such molecules but of their\nintrinsic representation and description. Of course, the four bases of RNA (or DNA) pertain to the\nmost universal language and description of our biological reality. Let us explain it .Bases of the\nsame heterocyclic kind (purine or pyrimidine) have the same signs .A proper reference frame may\nbe introduced which slides along the RNA chain from 5' to the 3' end. Let the j-th and k-th\nnucleotides be paired. The base pair X j Yk ( j < k ) is encountered twice :when the reference frame\nreaches position j , and from this position, nucleotide X j looks upright, but nucleotide Yk is\nupside-down; still, when reference frame reaches position k , from here nucleotide Yk looks upright,\nbut nucleotide X j is upside-down. It follows that one may distinguish four base pair states of RNA\nsince AU and UA, CG and GC, are no longer identical. A\u2193 , U \u2193 , C \u2191 , G\u2191 , U \u2191 , A\u2191 , G\u2193 , C \u2193 , once\nagain, may be represented by Pauli matrices that in physics are representative of the spin but here\nrepresent base-pair values and still the base-pair creation and base-pair disruption. These results\nwere obtained by Y. Magarshak [8]. We retain that they confirm fully our thesis. The notion of spin\nmust be intended according to a very general meaning, that one of an entity that is articulated at a\nphysical but also informative, and logic level until as a proto quantum like potential entity, whose\ngreat importance may be identified in biological as well as in physiological studies.\nLet us consider still another important result that also legitimates the reason to consider the role of\nspin on a more general plane. Chaotic behaviors have been identified in a consistent number of\nsignals pertaining to physiology and biology [9]. Starting with 1999, A. Jadczyk and R. Olkiewicz\n[10] showed that simultaneous measurements of non commuting spin components lead to a chaotic\njump on a quantum spin sphere and to generation of specific fractal images on the basis of a non\n\n\flinear iterated function system. Thus, once again, non commutativity, as just was outlined also by\nM. Zak in a previous work [11], and spin may be also responsible of chaotic behaviors.\nSeveral authors, [6,12] repeatedly evidenced that the spin is the essence of quantum mechanics\nhaving an ontological meaning. Hu and Wu repeatedly outlined that the driving force behind the\nevolution of Shr\u00f6dinger equation is quantum spin and, since quantum entanglement arises from the\nevolution of Shr\u00f6dinger equation the said spin is the genuine cause of quantum entanglement. To\nsupport this thesis we outline that recently we showed that Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a manifestation\nof an abstract algebraic formulation in which the basic elements are given as well as in the Pauli\nspin formulation [13]. Quantum potentialities arise through quantum superposition principle that is\nadmitted in Scr\u00f6dinger equation.\n4. On the Possibility to Introduce an Algebraic Structure as Quantum Like Scheme of Our\nReality.\nThe conclusion of the previous section is that with the term spin we should intend an entity that\nseems to assume a general role in our reality for the variety of the dynamics that it is able to\nsupport and for the high differentiation of the processes to which it is able to oversee. We aim to\ngive a reason for such an entity to oversee the natural phenomena at different levels. The reason\ncould be that the so called spin as admitted in physics is really expression of a more general and\ndifferentiated essence and modality of self-fulfilment of reality at its various levels of manifestation.\nThe confirmation could arise under a mathematical profile. It is known that on October 16 of 1843,\na mathematician, Sir W.R. Hamilton, discovered hypercomplex numbers [14] that he initially\nidentified as the algebra of pure time. The scientific community acknowledged lukewarmly such a\nnew mathematical discovery . J.T. Graves stated \"I have not yet any clear views on the extent to\nwhich we are at liberty to arbitrarily create new imaginaries and to endow them with supernatural\nproperties\"-such as non commutativity. In the 19 th century W.M. Clifford [15] completed the work\ninitiated by Grassman and Hamilton giving a complete formulation of such algebraic structures. A\nrather trivial but interesting feature is that the Hamilton algebra may be also represented by\nmatrices and in this case we re-find Pauli matrices and the non commutativity of the basic\ngenerators of the algebra in the same manner in which they appear in quantum theory of spin.\nTherefore , the reason for what we have previously called the universality of spin could be\nexplained in the fact that its mathematical counterpart regards an algebraic structure, and algebraic\nstructures arise in the description of natural processes and they have universal character. If we\nidentify the spin Pauli matrices of physics in the inner body of an algebraic structure, in some sense\nwe may attempt to show that such a structure represents a rough scheme of quantum like\nmechanics. If so, the universality of the algebraic structure should draw directly on the possibility to\nretain the same quantum like expressed theory as not specialized only at the quantum microphysical\nlevel for which it was introduced in 1927. In this manner we return to consider the problem of the\npotentiality and actuality that constitutes the basic aim of the present paper. As outlined in the first\nsection, quantum mechanics exhibits two basic and original features. The first is that it admits\npotential as well as actualized states of physical reality. The second point is that it admits that,\nunder suitable circumstances, we have a stochastic transition from potentiality to actualization of\nstates via the so called unknown mechanism of the wave function reduction or psi collapse. In\nsubstance, if such a strong link exists between the given algebraic structure and a rough scheme of\nquantum mechanics, we must re-find in the algebra the results of quantum mechanics. First of all\nwe have to delineate in detail the basic features of such an algebraic structure, discussing in\nparticular its basic assumptions and the manner in which this algebra may derived on the basis of\nits starting axiomatic points. Shown that the introduced algebraic structure, represents actually a\nquantum like scheme of quantum mechanics, we may attempt to take a great step forward and this is\nto say to give for a first time a rigorous mathematical proof of the transition from potentiality to\nactualization that represents the basic indemonstrable fixed focus of all the quantum mechanics. We\ncould be entirely successful since the algebraic structure that we will use could represent a more\n\n\fgeneral ontological construction respect to a more restricted realization that could be represented\nfrom traditional quantum theory. These are the objectives that are reached in the following section.\nHere we will utilize the great work that, starting with 1981, was developed by Y. Ilamed and N.\nSalingaros [16]. We will follow the same technique that these authors used in their work. We\nanticipate here that only two basic assumptions, quoted as (a) and (b) in the following section,\nseem that are required in order to formulate a rough scheme of quantum mechanics.\n5. The Proof of Some Theorems.\nIn this section we give a rigorous proof of theorems characterizing the algebra that we employ. We\nwill follow some basic results that were previously given by Y. Ilamed and N. Salingaros [16] in\n1981, when these authors studied in detail the algebra with three anticommuting elements.\nLet us consider three abstract basic elements, ei , with i = 1,2,3 , and the element e0 , and let us\nadmit the following two assumptions:\na) it exists the scalar square for each basic element:\ne1e1 = k1 , e2 e2 = k 2 , e3 e3 = k 3 with k i \u2208 R .\n(1)\nIn particular we have also that\ne0 e0 = 1 .\n\nb) The basic elements ei are anticommuting elements, that is to say:\ne1e2 = \u2212e2 e1 , e2 e3 = \u2212e3 e2 , e3 e1 = \u2212e1e3 .\n(2)\nIn particular it is\nei e0 = e0 ei = ei .\nNote that, owing to the axioms (a) and (b), the given basic elements must be considered abstract\npotential entities having the potentiality to simultaneously assume the numerical values \u00b1 k i1 / 2 . This\nis confirmed in particular by examining the (14) that is direct emanation of the two starting axioms.\nAccording to [16], these are the necessary and the sufficient conditions to derive all the basic\nfeatures of the algebra that we employ. To give proof, let us consider the general multiplication of\nthe three basic elements e1 , e2 , e3 , using scalar coefficients \u03c9 k , \u03bb k , \u03b3 k pertaining to some field:\ne1e2 = \u03c91e1 + \u03c9 2 e2 + \u03c9 3 e3 ; e2 e3 = \u03bb1e1 + \u03bb 2 e2 + \u03bb3 e3 ; e3 e1 = \u03b3 1e1 + \u03b3 2 e2 + \u03b3 3 e3 . (3)\nLet us introduce left and right alternation:\ne1e1e2 = (e1e1 )e2 ; e1e2 e2 = e1 (e2 e2 ) ; e2 e2 e3 = (e2 e2 )e3 ; e2 e3 e3 = e2 (e3 e3 ) ; e3 e3 e1 = (e3 e3 )e1 ;\ne3 e1e1 = e3 (e1e1 ) .\n(4)\nUsing the (4) in the (3) it is obtained that\nk1e2 = \u03c91 k1 + \u03c9 2 e1e2 + \u03c9 3 e1e3 ;\nk 2 e1 = \u03c91e1e2 + \u03c9 2 k 2 + \u03c9 3 e3 e2 ;\nk 2 e3 = \u03bb1e2 e1 + \u03bb 2 k 2 + \u03bb3 e2 e3 ;\nk 3 e2 = \u03bb1e1e3 + \u03bb 2 e2 e3 + \u03bb3 k 3 ;\nk 3 e1 = \u03b3 1e3 e1 + \u03b3 2 e3 e2 + \u03b3 3 k 3 ;\nk1e3 = \u03b3 1 k1 + \u03b3 2 e2 e1 + \u03b3 3 e3 e1 .\n(5)\nFrom the (5), using the assumption (b), we obtain that\n\u03c9\n\u03c91\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\ne1e2 + \u03c9 2 \u2212 3 e2 e3 = 1 e3 e1 \u2212 2 e2 e3 + \u03b3 3 ;\nk2\nk2\nk3\nk3\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\u03c91 + 2 e1e2 \u2212 3 e3 e1 = \u2212 1 e3 e1 + 2 e2 e3 + \u03bb3 ;\nk1\nk1\nk3\nk3\n\n\f\u03b31 \u2212\n\n\u03b3\n\u03bb\n\u03b32\n\u03bb\ne1e2 + 3 e3 e1 = \u2212 1 e1e2 + \u03bb 2 + 3 e2 e3\nk1\nk1\nk2\nk2\n\n(6).\n\nFor the principle of identity , we have that it must be\n\n\u03c91 = \u03c9 2 = \u03bb2 = \u03bb3 = \u03b3 1 = \u03b3 3 = 0\n\n(7)\n\nand\n\u2212 \u03bb1 k1 + \u03b3 2 k 2 = 0\n\u03b3 2 k 2 \u2212 \u03c93 k 3 = 0\n(8)\n\u03bb1 k1 \u2212 \u03c9 3 k 3 = 0\nThe (8) is an homogeneous system admitting non trivial solutions since its determinant \u039b = 0 ,and\nthe following set of solutions is given:\nk1 = \u2212\u03b3 2\u03c9 3 , k 2 = \u2212\u03bb1\u03c9 3 , k 3 = \u2212\u03bb1\u03b3 2\n(9).\nAdmitting k1 = k 2 = k 3 = +1 , it is obtained that\n\u03c9 3 = \u03bb1 = \u03b3 2 = i\n(10)\nUsing the (3), the theorem is proven , showing that the basic features of the considered algebra are\ngiven in the following manner\ne1e2 = \u2212e2 e1 = ie3 ; e2 e3 = \u2212e3 e2 = ie1 ; e3 e1 = \u2212e1e3 = ie2 ; i = e1e2 e3\n(11).\nThe content of theorem 1. is thus established: given three abstract basic elements as defined in (a)\nand (b), an algebraic structure is established with four generators ( e0 , e1 , e2 , e3 ).\nNote that the (11) represents one of the most basic relations in quantum mechanics. It has been here\nderived only on the basis of two algebraic assumptions, given respectively in (a) and (b).\nWe may now add some comments to the previous formulation.\nThe activity of scientific knowledge in two hundred years of development unequivocally shows that\nsome algebraic structures arise naturally in the description of natural entities and phenomena. Thus,\nit is quite natural to attempt to identify the phenomenological counterpart of the algebraic structure\ngiven in (11). From (1) we have that\ne12 = 1 , e22 = 1 , e32 = 1\n(12)\nThe (12) evidences that , being the e i abstract potential entities , we may choice to attribute them\nthe numerical values of \u00b1 1 . Admitting to be p1 (+1) the probability to attribute the value + 1 to e1\nand p1 (\u22121) that one for \u2212 1 , considering the corresponding notation for the two remaining basic\nelements , we may introduce the following mean values:\n< e1 >= (+1) p1 (+1) + (\u22121) p1 (\u22121)\n,\n< e2 >= (+1) p 2 (+1) + (\u22121) p 2 (\u22121) ,\n< e3 >= (+1) p3 (+1) + (\u22121) p3 (\u22121).\n(13)\nIt has been shown elsewhere [17] that\n< e1 > 2 + < e2 > 2 + < e3 > 2 \u2264 1\n(14).\nLet us observe that the (14) may be considered to represent a general principle of ontic\npotentialities and, in particular, it indicates that we never can attribute simultaneously definite\nnumerical values to two basic elements ei . In conclusion, as seen by the axioms (a) and (b), by the\n(11), by the (13) and the (14), we have delineated a rough scheme of quantum like theory through\nan algebraic structure. In this algebraic scheme some principles of the basic theoretical framework\nresult to be represented.\n\n\fThese principles are that the given algebraic structure reflects an intrinsic indetermination and an\nontic potentiality for its abstract elements. This means that, in absence of a direct numerical\nattribution, such basic elements are symbols that act in the algebra as such symbols, having an\nintrinsic indetermination and an ontic potentiality. This is to say that, in absence of attribution of a\ngiven numerical value, the basic elements ei operate in the given algebraic structure preserving the\npotentiality to assume a direct, possible, numerical value at any stage of the algebraic operations. In\naddition, let us consider, as example, to be < e1 >= 1 (attribution of +1 to e1 ), the (14)\nunequivocally shows that both e2 and e3 remain in the superposition of potential states of +1 and -1.\nLet us explain this last point in detail. The algebraic structure given in (1), (2), and (11) admits\nidempotents. Let us consider two of such idempotents:\n1 + e3\n1 \u2212 e3\n\u03c81 =\nand \u03c8 2 =\n(15)\n2\n2\nIt is easy to verify that \u03c8 12 = \u03c8 1 and \u03c8 22 = \u03c8 2 . Let us examine now the following algebraic\nrelations:\ne3\u03c8 1 = \u03c8 1e3 = \u03c8 1\n(16)\ne3\u03c8 2 = \u03c8 2 e3 = \u2212\u03c8 2\n(17)\nSimilar relations hold in the case of e1 or e2 . The relevant result is that the (16) establishes that the\ngiven algebraic structure, with reference to the idempotent \u03c8 1 , attributes to e3 the numerical value\nof + 1 while the (17) establishes that, with reference to\u03c8 2 , the numerical value of -1 is attributed to\ne3 .\nThe conclusion is very important. The conceptual counter part of the (16) and (17) is that we are in\npresence of a self-referential process. On the basis of such self-referential process, as given in (16)\nand in (17), this algebraic structure is able to attribute a precise numerical value to its basic\nelements. Each of the three basic elements is able to make a transition from the condition of pure\npotentiality to a condition of actuality, that is to say in mathematical terms from the pure symbolic\nrepresentation of the given abstract elements to that one of a real number. Let us remember that, on\nthe basis of the (14), this self-referential process may regard each time one and only one of the\nthree basic elements. In brief, for the first time we are analyzing an algebraic structure that\nrepresents a rough quantum like scheme and that, at the same time, as repeatedly admitted also in\nusual quantum mechanics, evidences, on the basis of a self-referential process, that it is possible a\ntransition from potentiality to actualization as we discussed it in the first section of this paper.\nNote also the importance of the (16) and the (17) from the view point of the logic. Through the selfreferential process given in (16) and (17), our algebra recovers two first principles of logic that are\nthe Principle of non-Contradiction and the Principle of the excluded Middle.\nObviously, in order to reach a rigorous formulation of such matter, the central question that\nmathematically arises is that we must give proof that it does exist and it may be carefully defined\nan algebraic structure that initially is given as by the (1), (2), and (11) and then it is characterized\nby the numerical attribution to one of its basic elements, as example to e3 , of one numerical\nvalue, say of + 1 or of -1. The same conclusion holds if we consider a numerical attribution to e1 or\nto e2 .\nLet us consider the following argument.\nIf\ne3 \u2192 +1\n(18)\nwe should have that\n\u03c8 1 \u2192 +1 , \u03c8 2 \u2192 0 ,\n(19)\nand, in the (11),\ne1e2 = i , e2 e1 = \u2212i , e2 i = \u2212e1 , ie2 = e1 , e1i = e2 , ie1 = \u2212e2\n(20).\n\n\fIn other terms, if we attribute the numerical value of + 1 to e3 a new algebraic structure arises with\nnew generators whose rules are given in (20) instead of in (11). Therefore, the arising central\nproblem is to proof the real existence of such new algebraic structure. Note that, in the case of the\nstarting algebraic structure we showed that it exists in the following manner\ne12 = 1 , e22 = 1 , e32 = 1 , i = e1e2 e3 , e1e2 = \u2212e2 e1 = ie3 , e2 e3 = \u2212e3 e2 = ie1 , e3 e1 = \u2212e1e3 = ie2 .\nIn the present case, with e3 \u2192 +1 , we have to show that it exists in the following manner\ne12 = 1 , e22 = 1 , i 2 = \u22121 , e1e2 = i , e2 e1 = \u2212i , e2 i = \u2212e1 , ie2 = e1 , e1i = e2 , ie1 = \u2212e2\n(22).\nWe arrive at the proof of theorem 2: given the algebraic structure A, fixed as in the (1), (2), and\n(11), it exists an algebraic structure B, that we call a subalgebra of A, with basic elements\n(generators) given in (22).To proof, consider that we now attribute to e3 the numerical value of\n+ 1 and so it is dismissed from the basic scheme of the three anticommuting basic elements. It is\nnow replaced by i . Rewriting the (3) and performing calculations we arrive to the solutions of the\n(8) that are given in the following manner:\nk1 = \u2212\u03b3 2\u03c9 3 , k 2 = \u2212\u03bb1\u03c9 3 , k 3 = \u2212\u03bb1\u03b3 2\n(22)\nwhere this time it must be k1 = k 2 = +1 and k 3 = \u22121 . The solutions are given for\n\u03c9 3 = +1 , \u03bb1 = \u22121, \u03b3 2 = \u22121\n(23)\nand consequently the (22) are proven as expected. Therefore it is shown that in the case e3 \u2192 +1 ,\nthe subalgebra B exists having the basic features given in (22).\nThe theorem 2 may be shown also in the case in which we attribute to e3 the numerical value of \u2212 1 .\nWe have\ne3 \u2192 \u22121\n(24)\nand\n\u03c8 1 \u2192 0 ,\u03c8 2 \u2192 \u22121\n(25)\n\nand the subalgebra B is given in the following terms:\ne12 = 1 , e22 = 1 , i 2 = \u22121 , e1e2 = \u2212i , e2 e1 = i , e2 i = e1 , ie2 = \u2212e1 , e1i = \u2212e2 , ie1 = e2 (26)\nThe solutions of the (22) are given in this case by \u03c9 3 = \u22121 , \u03bb1 = +1 , \u03b3 2 = +1 . The theorem is shown\nalso in this case. In a similar way it is obtained the proof when considering the case of attribution of\na numerical value to e1 or to e2 .\nIn this manner we have reached the central aim of the paper. Also if using an algebraic structure,\nthis is the first time in which we are able to show the manner in which it is realized the passage\nfrom potentiality to actualization and it has been demonstrated by using a rigorous formulation\nbased on two mathematical theorems. Since, as previously said, the counterpart exists in natural\nprocesses of the algebraic structures arising during their description, we expect that the two\ntheorems demonstrate the passage from potentiality to actualization in our reality.\n6. An Application in \u03c8 - collapse of Quantum Mechanics.\nIt is well known that one of the basic unsolved problems of quantum mechanics resides in the so\ncalled process of reduction of wave function or \u03c8 -collapse.\nConsider a two state quantum system S with connected quantum observable \u03c3 3 . It is known that we\nhave\n\uf8eb1\uf8f6\n\uf8eb0\uf8f6\n\u03c8 = c1 \u03c61 + c 2\u03c6 2\nwith \u03c61 = \uf8ec\uf8ec \uf8f7\uf8f7\nand \u03c6 2 = \uf8ec\uf8ec \uf8f7\uf8f7\n(27)\n\uf8ed0\uf8f8\n\uf8ed1\uf8f8\nand\n2\n\nc1 + c 2\n\n2\n\n=1\n\n(28)\n\n\fIt is still known that we may represent the state of such system by a density matrix \u03c1 given in the\nfollowing terms\n\u03c1 = a + be1 + ce2 + de3\n(29)\nwith\n2\n2\n2\n2\nc1\nc2\nc1 \u2212 c 2\nc1\u2217 c 2 + c1c 2\u2217\ni (c1c 2\u2217 \u2212 c1\u2217 c 2 )\n, b=\n, c=\n, d=\n(30)\na=\n+\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nwhere in matrix notation, e1 , e2 , and e3 are the well known Pauli matrices\n\uf8eb0 1\uf8f6\n\uf8eb0 \u2212 i\uf8f6\n\uf8eb1 0 \uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n(31)\ne1 = \uf8ec\uf8ec\n,\ne2 = \uf8ec\uf8ec\n,\ne3 = \uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed1 0\uf8f8\n\uf8edi 0 \uf8f8\n\uf8ed 0 \u2212 1\uf8f8\nIt is also easily verified and well known that we may find a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix representation of the\nalgebra A (as well as of the subalgebra B), given in the previous section, by using the same matrix\nconfiguration, given in (31). In conclusion we may write the (30) in explicit form in one of the two\nequivalent forms:\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c1 = ( c1 + c 2 ) + (c1c 2\u2217 )(e1 + e2 i ) + (c1\u2217 c 2 )(e1 \u2212 ie2 ) + ( c1 \u2212 c 2 )e3\n(32)\n2\n2\n2\n2\nor\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c1 = ( c1 + c 2 ) + (c1c 2\u2217 )(e1 + ie2 ) + (c1\u2217 c 2 )(e1 \u2212 e2 i ) + ( c1 \u2212 c 2 )e3\n(33)\n2\n2\n2\n2\nLet us admit now that we make a measurement of \u03c3 3 with result +1. Admitting in this case that the\nsubalgebra B obtained in the previous section is valid, we have that the (18), the (19), and the (22)\nare valid in the (32), and thus we have that the quantum interference terms disappear and the matrix\ndensity is reduced to\n2\n\u03c1 M = c1 \u00d7 I\nI = unitymatrix.\n(34)\n\nIn the case of the measurement of \u03c3 3 is performed with result -1, the same subalgebra holds where\nnow the (24), the (25), and the (26) are valid. Applied to the (33), still the interference terms\ndisappear, and they give this time that\n2\n\n\u03c1 M = c2 \u00d7 I\n(35)\nAs expected, the subalgebra B, introduced in the previous section, describes the collapse of the\nwave function in quantum mechanics.\n7. On the possibility for Quantum Ontic Potentiality to Explain a Central Role in the\nDynamics of Living Matter.\nIn the present version of this paper we would add to the mathematical proof, given in the previous\ntwo sections, a deepening on the central role that quantum ontic potentialities could have in the\ndynamics of the living matter. We will follow in detail an excellent paper that was recently written\nby P.C.W. Davies [18] on this subject. According to this author we start outlining that biological\nsystems must be essentially intended as information processors. It must be outlined here that ideas\nsimilar to those given by P.C.W. Davies, were also introduced by A.Yu. Khrennikov [18] as well as\nalso such author considered the notion of Transformers of Information when speaking of living\nsystems. The basic key here is that if we reason in the framework of a classical context, the\nbiological molecules must be intended as processors of bits of information. This is in a classical\nphysical framework, while instead, in a quantum like context, biological molecules become\nprocessors of qubits of information, that is to say this time that the information processing\nbecomes direct consequence of the superposition principle of quantum mechanics that, as\npreviously discussed in detail, regulates ontic potential states in the dynamics of our reality. To be\nclear, it does not exist at all a proven verification that quantum mechanics operates at the level of\nbiological matter attending such theory to the dynamics of the biological sphere with its\n\n\ffundamental and ontological features as in particular the superpositions and thus the ontological\npotentiality of states and the transition from potential to actualized states. However, repeating what\nit was just evidenced in [18], quantum mechanics works in living matter in explaining, as example,\nthe shapes of biomolecules, the specificity of proteins or the templating functions of nucleic acids.\nIt is at work in determining diffusion rates or membrane properties or the strengths of molecular\nbounds, all results that of course result so determinant in understanding basic features of living\nmatter. It should be still a matter of a restricted epistemic vision to accept that quantum mechanics\nis only matter of calculations at atomic, molecular and biomolecular levels at the biological level.\nAs discussed in the previous sections, and as it has been evidenced in particular through the\ntheorem 2, this theoretical elaboration is a theoretical body that includes so advanced and so\nradically new principles and views on our reality as in particular all that in an ontic vision is linked\nto the superposition of states, to potentiality and actualization and still to many other well known\nfeatures that render this theory completely new and radically innovative in the complex\nphenomenology and ontology of the dynamics of the reality. Therefore, the basic interest becomes\nto ascertain if and how such features, so complex to be admitted at an ontic level of our reality, are\nthey at work in dynamics of the biological being.\nThere are many directions we may consider wit this perspective. The first , also indicated in [18], is\nthat one that one may define of the quantum mutations. In the framework of the previously\nconsidered quantum ontic potentialities, one evaluates that the genetic code could be considered as\na quantum code in which the superposition of coding states would act leading to spontaneous errors\nin base pairing. This idea may be dated back to the discovery by Crick and Watson of the structure\nof the DNA and to the consequent possibility that mutations could occur as result of quantum\nfluctuations, that therefore should became the source of random biological information. Here the\nquantum mechanism that may be advocated is that one of the quantum tunnelling that represents the\nmost essential and also the most surprising process of all quantum mechanics. Proton tunnelling\ncould indeed alter the structure of nucleotide bases leading to incorrect pair bonding. The basic key\nhere is that the quantum tunnelling is the most evident example of ontic superposition of potential\nstates that we have in Nature. In analogy with the (27) that we introduced previously to represent a\nquantum mechanical two level system, but remaining on the general plane of discussion, we have\nin this last case that at any time the state of the particle may be described by a state function that is a\nlinear superposition of two potential states, one corresponding to the condition that the particle has\ntunnelled and one corresponding instead to the condition that the particle still has not tunnelled. We\nhave that, still see also the (27),\n\u03c8 = c1\u03c6 tunnelingstil ln othappened + c 2 \u03c6 tunnelinghappened\n(36)\nwith\n2\n\np1 = c1 = probability for tunnelling not to happen\nand\np2 = c2\n\n2\n\n= probability for tunnelling to happen,\n\np1 + p 2 = 1\nThe (36) represents an excellent example of quantum superposition of states. The clue with\nbiological dynamics was given by J. McFadden and J. Al-Khalili [19]. These authors started\nobserving that the central assumption that mutations happen randomly has been challenged by the\nprocess called adaptive or directed mutation. It was also detected experimentally when a nonfermeating strain of Escheria coli was plated onto rich media containing lactose [19]. In\nexperiments performed by J. Cairns et al. [20] ,papillae of lac + lactose fermenting mutants arose\nover a period of several weeks yet mutations that did not confer any selective advantage did not\nappear during incubation [19, 20]. lac + mutants arose instead in experiments with much more\nfrequencies in absence of lactose. Adaptive mutations were also observed in other experiments [21].\nAdaptive mutations are different from standard mutations since they occur in cell that are not\n\n\fdividing or dividing rarely, they are time dependent but not replication dependent, they appear only\nafter the cell is exposed to selective pressure [19]. In order to explain adaptive mutations, different\nauthors [22] proposed to consider that they could be generated by environment induced collapse of\nthe wave function describing DNA in a superposition of mutational states. This is exactly the\nsuperposition of potential states and its actualization that in the previous section we have shown to\nbe possible by the theorems 1, and 2. In [19] it was investigated the possibility discussed in [22]\nand a specific model of mutational process involving quantum tunnelling and the time of\ndecoherence were specifically introduced. The authors considered the so called Lowdin two step\nmodel [23] for generation of mutations initiated by the proton tunnelling of an H-bonded proton\nbetween adjacent sites within base pairs. Considering DNA replication, the state will evolve to\nincorporate both the correct base C for tunnelling not happened and the incorrect base T for\ntunnelling happened. We will have a superposition of potential states, one consisting of the\nunmutated condition and the other consisting instead of the mutated condition. The daughter DNA\nwill be a superposition of potentialities, mutated and unmutated conditions:\n\u03c8 = c1\u03c6 tunnelingnothappened C state + c 2 \u03c6 tunnelinghappened Tstate\n(37)\nAgain here the basic importance of the theorem 2 is clearly evidenced. In biological matter forms of\npotentialities coexist in order to give final forms of actualization.\nAssumed the mutant form of the protein , as example\nlacZ\ncontaining an arginine\u0001 histidine amino acid substation resulting in lac \u2212 \u2192 lac + mutation in the\ncell in absence of lactose, the final state of the cell will be still a superposition of unmutated and\nmutated conditions\n\u03c8 = c1\u03c6 tunnelingnothappened C state Arg .state + c 2 \u03c6 tunnelinghappened Tstate His .state (38)\nthat will actualize to a final form according to the theorem 2.\nQuite similar is the important chapter on enzyme reactions. Still according to [18], enzymes are\ncatalyzing proteins during biochemical reactions. They give so high reactions rates that we cannot\nexpect to be explained in the framework of the usual catalytic mechanics. Also here quantum\ntunnelling explains an essential role and this decisive role has been evidenced by a series of detailed\nand important results [24]. Again here, the invoked tunnelling mechanism is expressed by the (36)\nand thus also in this relevant field of biological matter the importance to recall the concept of\nsuperposition of potentialities and then of actualization in biological dynamics, results to be\ndecisive as stated by theorem 2.\nAnother way to consider quantum effects is in the sphere of the nanostructures [18]. The proton\npump has the role to maintain the appropriate voltage across the cell membranes [25]. These\nstructures are complex enzymes whose operation seems to be described by quantum onedimensional nanotubes. Also membranes are involved in very complex process. Here it is expected\nthat the quantization of nonlinear membrane vibrations in cells should exhibit quantum behaviours\nas a Bose condensate [18].\nFinally, we have the great role that quantum mechanics could hold at the level of synaptic\ntransmission among neurons. Again Eccles and Beck, as well as J. Walker, [26], argued that neuron\nfirings should be regulated from quantum tunnelling, as in the (36), and J. Walker, in particular,\ngave theoretical results in accord also with the experimental data in relation to the f mepp of vesicle\nrelease. Recently we formulated some models legitimating the same advent of consciousness [7,17]\non the basis of quantum tunnelling.\nThere is still another important question resulting very convincing in admitting a basic role of\nquantum superposition principle and quantum like general scheme in dynamics of living matter. It\nrelates the genetic code. In section three we inferred about a quantum like scheme of DNA and\nRNA considering the results of Magarshak [6] and identifying base pair values and base-pair\nconstruction and destruption by spin Pauli matrices. Again, we consider here that the origin of the\ngenetic code may be linked to quantum information processing. It has been outlined by Patel in\n\n\f2001 [27] that the nucleotide bases could be represented and remain in a superposition of quantum\nstates for the time necessary to participate to replication process. One may consider that the\nuniversal genetic code is based on triplets of nucleotides of four varieties that code for 20 or 21\namino acids. In 1996 [27] L.K. Grover found an optimal quantum search algorithm in the sphere of\nquantum computing . Indicating by N the number of objects that can be distinguished by a number\nof yes/no queries , this author found that\n1\n\u03c0\n( 2Q + 1 )arcsen(\n)=\n(39)\n2\nN\nNote that this is the result of quantum algorithm. This is to say that it does not use classical\narguments as well as it does not use advanced quantum mechanics. It employs only the principle of\nsuperposition of quantum states and of quantum interference. The algorithm starts in fact assuming\nan uniform superposition of all the possible states corresponding to equal probability for every\nbuilding block to be selected. Now , as stated in [26,18], the very convincing argument is that the\n(39) admits just the following solutions:\nQ =1\nand N = 4 ;\nQ=3\nand N = 20.2 ;\nthis is to say that such quantum algorithm, based on the quantum superposition principles, gives\nactually as solution for the genetic code the triplets of four varieties of 20-21 amino acids. If not due\nto unexpected trivial coincidence, this is a result that clearly evidences the presence of quantum\nmechanics at the basis of living matter.\nIt may be now also clear the reason because the reality of living matter would choice to operate on\nthe basis of quantum processing (qubit) instead of classical processing (bit), on the basis of\nsuperposition of ontic quantum potentialities and consequent actualization instead of concrete\nactualizations only. The reason is in a kind of exaltation of its power of processing information in\naddition to more specific ontologic motivations. Correctly P.C. W. Davies arranges the problem\n[18]: the life and its origin are in some sense a kind of search problem. The subset of living systems\nis an extremely small fraction of the total space of complex systems. As example, the fraction of\npeptide chains having biological relevance is exponentially very small respect to the whole set of all\nthe possible sequences. Only a very small fraction of all the nucleotide sequences code for the\nbiological function. So the central arising question is the following: given a mixture of classical\nmolecular building blocks, how may and, as P. Davies outlines [18], how did matter to find the\nappropriate and extremely improbable combination by change among all the possible combinations\nand in a contained period of time? Any classical explanation shows that it would take a time much\nlonger than the age of the universe [18]. It is quantum mechanics to give the possibility to answer\ncorrectly since it, according to theorem 2, runs about potentialities and actualization. Let us look at\nthe time evolution model that we roughly introduced in section two:\n\u03c8 n +1,A + \u03c6 n +1,P X P = (\u03c8 n ,A + \u03c6 n , P X P )(\u03c8 n ,A + \u03c6 n ,P X P ) = \u03c8 2n , A + \u03c6 2n ,P + 2\u03c8 n ,A \u03c6 n ,A X P (40)\nAt any stage of such supposed evolution this system processes simultaneously three information\nways, it drags three possible values of actualization respect to only one that should compete in the\nclassical case. Since quantum systems admit superposition of states , they may be hold and they\nmay also search for a great variety of alternatives at the same time. As currently said, they may\nexplore and process information in parallel instead of in series. In this manner such systems may\nexplore a vast array of alternatives simultaneously and at a more accentuated speed respect to the\ntraditional case. This is the reason because sequences of biological relevance may be found much\nfaster than one may have in a classical non quantum framework.\nWe would now to face the last argument. The fractal nature of many biological systems is receiving\nconsiderable attention from some years. The basic feature of self-similarity has been identified in a\nlot of cases as in spatial structures or in temporal fluctuations of many biological signals as well as\nin ion channel kinetics, in fetal breathing, in human cognition, in neuron firings, in cardiovascular\nsystem. As known, the greatest part of such biological systems exhibit fluctuations like 1 / f noise.\n\n\fA number of different mechanisms have been proposed in order to explain the origin of such\n1 / f behaviour in nature and in biological matter. It has been argued that this behaviour could be\nmerely a result of the multiple system inputs to the considered system [28]. Owing to the\nwidespread nature of 1 / f noise in different biological systems the 1 / f behaviour could be due to\nthe fact that the final output should be affected by many processes that act at different time scales\nand in fact it has been shown that some distributions of time scales lead to 1/f behaviour.\nTherefore, this could be the origin of the complex fluctuations and 1 / f scaling so recurrently\nobserved in biological systems. In brief, in many biological systems the output of a system may be\nseen as the result of different semiautonomous contributing systems operating at different time\nscales. A convincing example is that one of Heart Rate where regulation takes part by a beat-to-beat\ncontribution deriving from the autonomic system. Here the heart rate oscillations experience the\ninput of a great variety of distinct random processes over a great variety of different time scales.\nWe have vagally- mediated random inputs with frequencies about 1\u20444 sec. , baroreflex modulations at\nfrequencies about 1/10 sec plus modulations due to the hormonal systems, posture, activity level,\nmeals, sleep-wake cycle, circadian rhythm and still other contributions acting on the sinus node\nactivity at different time scales. This is a model that explains 1 / f behaviour. According to [28], the\noutput model may be written at any time step, k , as\nn\n\ny( k ) = \u2211 Ai xi ( k )\n\n(41)\n\ni =1\n\nwhere each input is assumed to be amplified by a constant Ai representing the its relative effect on\nthe output of the considered system [28]. Given this starting model one does not expect to find\n1 / f behaviour in the framework of a quantum mechanical scheme. To show this, let us consider\nfirst a classical scheme. Here the time fluctuations of the signal are considered to be due to a kind\nof a random relaxation process that has a time constant \u03c4 and it may be easily shown that the power\nspectral density goes following the general form\ng( \u03c4 )\n(42)\nS( f ) =\n1 + f 2\u03c42\nand the classical behaviour cons tan t / f or cons tan t / f \u03b2 may be easily identified.\nIn this case the probability for each input signal is expressed in the following manner\nP( t ) = e \u2212 t / \u03c4\n(43)\nand, as previously said, it corresponds to a perfect classical scheme. To proof this one may consider\neach arriving input as the result of an intrinsically unstable system that at each time has a definite\nprobability to be present or not to be present. Considering two times t1 and t 2 with t 2 > t1 in this\nclassical schema one has that\nP( t1 )P( t 2 ) = P( t1 + t 2 )\n(44)\nSince, by hypothesis, the probability for the input signal to be present depends only upon time,\nconsidering only statistically independent events, we have the (43) that in fact admits then the (43)\nas solution. However, if we substitute our starting schema, considering instead that we have this\ntime a quantum mechanical mechanism generating the input instead of the previously admitted\nclassical picture, we have an unstable quantum system as starting case and thus in this case the\nbasic role of the superposition of the states (signal present and signal not present) must be\nessentially recalled. This question leads as consequence that we no more may adopt the (43) as\nprobability. In this quantum case, instead of the (43), we have the following expression for\nprobability:\n2\n2\nP( t ) = e \u2212 t 7\u03c4\n(45)\nThat, as it is easily seen, is profoundly different from the (43). In this case, however, the\nautocorrelation function will be\n\n\f2\n\n2\n\nC( t ) = Ai2 e \u2212 t / \u03c4\nand the power spectrum will be\n\u221e\n\nS ( f ) = Re Ai2 \u222b e \u2212 2 \u03c0ift e \u2212t\no\n\n2\n\n7 \u03c42\n\ndt\n\n(46)\n(47)\n\nthat still gives\nAi2 \u03c4\nS( f ) \u2245\n(48)\n1 + ( \u03c0f\u03c4 ) 2\nThe power spectrum scaling exhibits a crossover from brown noise to white noise with crossover\nvalue given at f \u2217 = 1 / \u03c4 . If only two processes will be superimposed in the sense of quantum\nmechanics we re find the 1 / f \u03b2 behaviour of the power spectrum.\nThe important conclusion is therefore the following: also in the case of pure quantum mechanical\ncontributions we find again the 1 / f \u03b2 behaviour of power spectrum that is exhibited from the\ngreatest variety of biological signals.\nFinally, we have to mention here one of the most important experiments that in our opinion have\nbeen performed in the last few years on this field of research.\nAs we know, wave-particle duality relates a basic feature of quantum physical reality, in substance\nit regards the fact that a quantum object may exhibit either wave or particle properties depending on\nthe experimental arrangement that we decide to use.\nR. Feynmann repeatedly outlined that the strangeness of quantum mechanics may be seen\nanalyzing in detail all that happens in the simple and elegant arrangement that we usually call the\nTwo Slit Experiment. However, in spite of its strangeness, the wave-particle duality of massive\nobjects is a true basic foundation of quantum physics. De Broglie's wave hypothesis , formulated in\n1923, was also confirmed experimentally for atoms and molecules, as He atoms and H 2 molecules,\nstarting with 1932 by Estermann and Stern [29] by diffraction experiments. A renewed interest for\nmolecular interferometry started in 1994 in consequence of the first observation of interference for\nI 2 by Ramsey and Bord\u00e9 [30]. The reason to indicate here such experimental results is that we\nretain that a quantum like mechanics is also too much involved in the dynamics of biological\nmatter, and a very recent result, obtained in the framework of molecular interferometry, confirms\nsuch an approach to matter. In a paper of 2003 the research group directed by Zellinger [31]\nreported to have obtained for the first time the demonstration of the wave and thus quantum nature\nof massive objects as biomacromolecules. Such quantum effects were observed for the\ntetraphenylporphyrin (TTP) and for the fluorinated fullerenes.The porphyrin structure is at the core\nof many complexes regarding biological matter as in particular biomolecules representing the color\ncenter in chlorophyll and in hemoglobin. On the other hand, the fluorofullerene is C 60 F48 , thus it is\na very massive object having 1632 amu. Dismissed or vanishing quantum effects should be\nexpected for such molecules. Instead such results indicate that the de Broglie wave nature of objects\nseems that may be the matter of some a generalization developing a possible role also at the so high\nstage of the molecular scale. As discussed in the previous sections of the present paper, we retain\nthat quantum mechanics may be generalized in order to be involved in the biological dynamics of\nmacromolecules, and possibly to overcome the limits of scale at the elementary or at the atomic\nlevel only as actually it was in the initial vision of founding fathers of quantum theory. The\ntheorem 2 that we have given in this paper, gives direct indication of the importance to have\nobtained a mathematical proof of the existence of potential states and of transition potentialityactualization that represent the core of any quantum mechanical view on our reality.\n\n\fREFERENCES\n\n1) A.
