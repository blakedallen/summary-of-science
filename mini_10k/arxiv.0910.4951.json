In most applications to particle physics N is a coset space G/H and\nthe theory is assumed to be globally invariant under the action of the group G. In contradistinction\nto other scalar fields used in condensed matter and particle physics, such as the Higgs model and\nits generalizations, the nonlinear sigma models are nonlinear already at the kinematical level, in\nthe sense that there is no linear structure on the configuration space: the sum of two fields is not\ndefined. This has deep consequences. If we limit ourselves to terms with two derivatives, we can\nwrite the (Euclidean) action\nZ\n1\ndd x \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u03b1 \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6\u03b2 h\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03c6) ,\n(1)\n2g2\nwhere we have chosen a coordinate system on N , and h\u03b1\u03b2 is a metric on N 1 . A free field theory is\none for which the action is quadratic in the field. This would require that the components h\u03b1\u03b2 are\nindependent of \u03c6, i.e. that the metric is flat. But topology forbids the existence of a flat metric on\nmost manifolds. Therefore the absence of a linear structure generally implies that these theories\ncan not be free.\nSince h\u03b1\u03b2 are in general nonpolynomial functions of the fields, the fields themselves, as well\nas h\u03b1\u03b2 , have to be dimensionless, and consequently the constant g 2 has dimension lengthd\u22122 . If\nN is a coset space and the action is G-invariant, a potential must necessarily be constant and\ncan be set to zero without loss of generality. Any term in the Lagrangian for such a theory must\ncontain derivatives of the fields, and (1) is the most general one containing two derivatives. The\nground states of the NLSM correspond to constant fields, and in the absence of a potential they\nare completely degenerate. We will choose an arbitrary vacuum with coordinates \u03c6\u03b10 . Note that a\nchoice of vacuum breaks the global symmetry group G leaving a residual symmetry H. The fields\n\u03c6\u03b1 are the resulting Goldstone bosons, and the NLSM is a theory of Goldstone bosons.\nIn general, the metric h\u03b1\u03b2 can be seen as representing infinitely many coupling constants. To\nmake this manifest, suppose we apply perturbation theory to the NLSM. First, in order to give the\nscalar fields their canonical dimension we absorb the constant g 2 in the fields, defining \u03c6\u0304\u03b1 = \u03c6\u03b1 /g.\n2\u2212d\nThe dimension of \u03c6\u0304 is then length 2 . Now the action reads\nZ\n1\ndd x \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u0304\u03b1 \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6\u0304\u03b2 h\u03b1\u03b2 (g\u03c6\u0304) .\n(2)\n2\nIn order to separate the kinetic term from the interaction terms we expand the field around the\nvacuum: \u03c6\u0304\u03b1 = \u03c6\u0304\u03b10 +\u03b7 \u03b1 , and expand the metric in Taylor series in \u03b7:\n1\nh\u03b1\u03b2 (g\u03c6\u0304) = h\u03b1\u03b2 (g\u03c6\u03040 )+g \u2202\u03b3 h\u03b1\u03b2 (g\u03c6\u03040 )\u03b7 \u03b3 + g2 \u2202\u03b3 \u2202\u03b4 h\u03b1\u03b2 (g\u03c6\u03040 )\u03b7 \u03b3 \u03b7 \u03b4 + * * *\n2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere we write \u2202\u03b3 for \u2202\u03c6\u2202 \u03b3 . The coefficients of this expansion are now field-independent and\nrepresent the coupling constants of the theory. Note that there is in general an infinite number\nof couplings and all couplings involve derivatives of the fields. The dimension of the coupling\nm\nconstant in the m-th interaction term, i.e. the coefficient of \u2202\u03b7 \u2202\u03b7 \u03b7 m , is length 2 (d\u22122) . In spite of\nthe infinite number of couplings, this theory is renormalizable in a generalized sense for d = 2 [3].\nIt is power counting nonrenormalizable for d > 2. Therefore, the nonlinear sigma model is not a\ngood candidate for a fundamental theory in more than two dimensions.\n1\n\nfor various ways of describing these models see ([1]) or ([2]).\n\n2\n\n\fThe existence of symmetries greatly reduces the number of couplings. The action (1) is Ginvariant if the metric h\u03b1\u03b2 is G-invariant, which means that there exist Killing vectors Ka satisfying\nthe Lie algebra of G. For example, if N is topologically a semisimple Lie group G, and the metric\nh\u03b1\u03b2 is invariant under both left and right multiplications, then h\u03b1\u03b2 is unique up to an overall scale.\nIn this case G-invariance reduces the number of arbitrary coupling constants to just one, which\ncan be identified with g. In this case it is common to describe the NLSM in a different formalism:\nchoose a linear representation of G, and a basis {Ta } in the Lie algebra such that the invariant\ninner product is TrTa Tb = \u03b4ab . The element of the group with coordinates \u03c6\u03b1 (x) corresponds to a\nmatrix U (x). Then the action (1) can be rewritten in the form\nZ\n1\ndd x Tr (U \u22121 \u2202\u03bc U U \u22121 \u2202 \u03bc U )\n(4)\n2g2\nThis form exhibits most clearly the invariance under global left and right G transformations. Since\nthe field U = 1 is invariant under the diagonal subgroup \u2206G = {(g, g)}, the proper characterization\nof the manifold N in this case is as the coset (GL \u00d7 GR )/\u2206G, where GL and GR denote the group\nG acting on itself from left or right 2 . For this reason, these are often called \"chiral models\".\nII.\n\nCHIRAL PERTURBATION THEORY\n\nThe main application of the NLSM to particle physics is as a low energy phenomenological approximation of QCD. In this case the field \u03c6 takes values in the manifold (SU (2)L \u00d7\nSU (2)R )/\u2206SU (2), and represents the direction chosen by the quark condensate. The three\n(pseudo) scalar fields are identified with the pions, and they can be thought of as low energy\nfluctuations in the condensate. The coupling g is equal to 1/f\u03c0 , where f\u03c0 is the pion decay constant. This model is an effective low energy description of strong interactions. A slightly more\ngeneral, but less accurate, model where SU (2) is replaced by SU (3), describes the dynamics of the\noctet of mesons, including also the kaons and the \u03b7. These models cease to give a good description\nof meson interactions at an energy scale of the order of several hundred MeV's. One can see this\nbreakdown from several viewpoints:\n1. experimentally, it is the scale at which other strongly interacting particles appear, which are\nnot accounted for by the model;\n2. from the point of view of QCD it is the characteristic mass scale of the condensate, so that\nthere is no meaning in talking of the dynamics of the condensate above this scale;\n3. from the point of view of the effective field theory itself, it is the scale at which perturbation\ntheory breaks down, as we shall discuss below.\nBesides pion physics, there is also another important application of the NLSM. If we use the local\nisomorphisms SU (2) \u223c SO(3) and SU (2)\u00d7SU (2) \u223c SO(4) to identify N \u2248 SO(4)/SO(3) \u2248 S 3 , we\ncan identify this manifold with the orbit of the minima of the potential of the complex Higgs doublet\nof the standard model. This NLSM can be viewed as a low energy effective theory describing the\ndynamics of the electroweak Goldstone bosons, in the approximation in which the mass of the Higgs\nparticle is infinitely large [4]. Since the Higgs mass is proportional to the quartic self coupling in\nthe Higgs potential, this is often referred to as the strong coupling limit of the Higgs model. When\n2\n\nNote that there is a subtle difference between the Lie group G and this coset: the former has a preferred element,\nnamely the identity, whereas the latter does not.\n\n3\n\n\fthis NLSM it is coupled to SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1) gauge fields, the Goldstone bosons give mass to the W \u00b1\nand the Z, and in the unitary gauge nothing is left in the scalar sector. Thus, the model can be\nviewed as describing a \"Higgsless Higgs phenomenon\". In this case we can identify g = 1/\u03c5, where\n\u03c5 = 246 GeV is the Higgs VEV. Above this scale the model is expected to break down at least for\nthe third of the reasons listed above. But unlike the case of strong interactions, the corresponding\nenergy scale has not yet been explored experimentally, so we don't know whether the other two\nreasons also hold.\nThere is a general formalism that can be used to extract physical consequences from these\neffective field theories, going under the name of \"chiral perturbation theory\" or \u03c7PT for short [5].\nThe NLSM is treated as a quantum field theory with a UV cutoff at scale \u039b. When one computes\nloop effects with the action (1), divergences appear that are proportional to operators containing\nmore than two derivatives. In order to absorb such divergences it is necessary to assume that the\ncorresponding operators are present in the action. Therefore in the effective field theory one has to\nallow all terms that are compatible with the symmetries of the system. Schematically, the action\ncan be organized in a derivative expansion\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\nd4 x g2 (U \u22121 \u2202U )2 + g4 (U \u22121 \u2202U )4 + g6 (U \u22121 \u2202U )6 + . . . .\n(5)\nThis expression is schematic because there can be several operators with the same number of\nderivatives, but for our present purposes, they all behave in the same way. Chiral perturbation\ntheory systematically organizes the contributions of all these operators. When one studies a process\nwith a given number of external legs characterized by some external momenta of order p \u226a \u039b,\nand one wants to calculate e.g. a cross section within a certain theoretical accuracy, one need\nto calculate only a finite number of contributions, where terms with higher derivatives appear\nat the same level as operators with fewer derivatives but in diagrams with higher loops. For\nexample to correctly describe the experimentally measured pion scattering cross sections, one has\nto supplement the action (1) by the four\u2013derivative terms\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\nd4 x g41 Tr(U \u22121 \u2202U )4 + g42 (Tr(U \u22121 \u2202U )2 )2\nand these four derivative terms give contributions, at tree level, which are of the same order as\nthose of (4) at one loop. The couplings g2 , g41 and g42 have to be taken from experiment, but\nthree experiments suffice to determine them and one can actually do more than three experiments\nwith pions, in such a way that the theory retains some predictive power.\nWhen one increases the accuracy, or the momentum, more and more contributions have to\nbe taken into account. Eventually when one wants to describe physics near the cutoff scale, all\noperators give comparable contributions. The coefficients of infinitely many operators would then\nhave to be determined by experiment and as a consequence this effective field theory description\nwould lose its predictive power.\nIII.\n\nEFFECTIVE QUANTUM FIELD THEORY OF GRAVITY\n\nThe historical role of Einstein's theory is as a classical field theory of gravity, and in this role\nit has been extraordinarily successful. Because all other interactions are described by quantum\ntheories, we would like to understand also gravity in quantum terms. This poses a number of\ndifficult challenges, both at technical and conceptual level. But in view of what was said in the\nprevious sections, we should recognize that a quantum description of gravity does not necessarily\nhave to be valid up to infinitely high energies. As a first step we could content ourselves with an\n4\n\n\feffective field theory description holding up to some cutoff scale [6]. In order to understand this\nbetter, let us write the (Euclidean) Hilbert action:\nZ\n1\n\u221a\n\u2212\ndd x g g \u03bc\u03bd R\u03bb\u03bc \u03bb \u03bd .\n(6)\n16\u03c0G\nWe note that, omitting indices, the Riemann tensor is schematically of the form \u2202\u0393 + \u0393 \u0393 and that\n\u0393 is of the form g \u22121 \u2202g, so that, aside from the metrics appearing explicitly in (6), the structure of\nthe Lagrangian is (g\u22121 \u2202g)2 , exactly as in (4). As a matter of fact, one can easily see that the metric\ng is a Goldstone boson (it has values in the coset GL(4)/O(4)) so the similarity of the Lagrangians\nis just a reflection of this deeper similarity at the kinematical level 3 .\nNewton's constant has exactly the same dimension as the coupling g2 in (4), and therefore, at\nthe level of power counting, Einstein's theory has the same quantum properties as the NLSM. Of\ncourse power counting does not tell us whether the potential divergences do occur or not: for this\none has to do the actual calculations. These were done, and the nonrenormalizable divergences\nwere seen to appear at one loop in the presence of matter [7] and at two loops for pure gravity [8].\nAs in the NLSM, quantum loops formed with the Hilbert action will therefore generate infinitely\nmany higher derivative terms. Because of diffeomorphism invariance, the effective action will have,\nsomewhat schematically, the form\nZ\n\u0003\n\u221a \u0002\n(7)\ndd x g g0 + g2 R + g4 R2 + g6 R3 + . . .\nwhere Rm has to be interpreted as a generic local, scalar operator containing 2m derivatives of\nthe metric (for example a scalar constructed by contracting the indices of m Riemann tensors),\nand the couplings gi have the same dimensions as the homologous couplings in (5). The main\ndifference between these expansions is the appearance of the g0 (cosmological) term, which has no\nanalogue in the NLSM. We can apply to this theory the methods of \u03c7PT [6]. The leading term will\nbe the tree level contribution of the Hilbert action. This is just the classical result of Einstein's\ntheory. The first correction will come from one loop terms calculated with the Hilbert action,\ncut\n\u221a\noff at the Planck scale, or from the four derivative\nterms. At momentum scale p \u226a 1/ G these\n\u221a\ncorrections will be suppressed by powers of p G and since the Planck scale is so much greater\nthan any accessible energy, these corrections are always extremely small, actually much smaller\nthan the homologous corrections in pion theory. From this point of view gravity could be regarded\nas the best available example of an effective quantum field theory: every experimental success of\nEinstein's classical theory is automatically also a success for this effective quantum field theory of\ngravity. We can therefore say that all we know about gravity is consistent with this picture. But\nthere is also a downside, and that is that all we know about gravity is also consistent with treating\nit just as a classical field theory. At present there seems to be only one possible scenario when\nquantum corrections could become directly testable at high energy accelerators, and this is if there\nexist \"large extra dimensions\", which would bring the effective Planck scale down to the TeV [9].\nIV.\n\nASYMPTOTIC SAFETY\n\nBy definition, effective field theories break down near their UV cutoff and have to be replaced\nby another theory at higher energies. The paradigm of this transition is again the theory of strong\ninteractions. At high energies they are described by QCD, which is a weakly interacting theory.\n3\n\nSimilar statements hold also in the vierbein formulation and in more general formulations ([1]).\n\n5\n\n\fAround the GeV scale the QCD interactions become strong, bound states form and at sufficiently\nlow energies their dynamics is described by the NLSM. The transition is not fully understood in\ndetail, but few doubt that this picture is basically correct. Clearly in this particular application\nthere is not much reason to try and extend the validity of the NLSM description beyond its natural\ncutoff. But in sections 2 and 3 I also mentioned other two low energy effective field theories, for\nwhich the relevant energy scale has not yet been explored. In the electroweak case we do not yet\nknow for sure that new states (whether fundamental particles or composites or resonances) will be\nfound at colliders, so we cannot (yet) invoke the first two reasons given in section 2 to claim that\nthe electroweak chiral model must break down at a scale of a few hundred GeV's. Even less can be\nsaid in the case of gravity. So in these cases it seems worth exploring the possibility that also the\nthird of the given reasons, which is the only one we can use from our low energy perspective, can be\ncircumvented. Namely, one may hope that as one approaches the putative cutoff \u039b, the effective\nfield theory somehow manages to heal itself of its perturbative problems and could continue to\nmake sense also at higher scales, potentially up to infinite energy. Specifically this can happen if\nthe running couplings, expressed in suitable units, reach a Fixed Point (FP).\nLet us illustrate this in the case of the NLSM action (1). As one sees from the expansion (3),\nd\u22122\nthe effective n-point vertex is proportional to g\u0303n\u22122 , where g\u0303 = gp 2 is an effective dimensionless\ncoupling, which takes into account the classical momentum dependence of the interaction. In\nd\u22122\nperturbation theory g\u0303 is essentially proportional to p 2 , and if one tries to use this theory beyond\nthe cutoff scale, g\u0303 becomes arbitrarily large. The way in which the theory could cure itself of this\nproblem is if the full renormalized g, including quantum corrections, depended on p in such a way\nas to exactly compensate this \"classical\" p-dependence. More precisely, we say that the NLSM\n2\u2212d\nwith action (1) has a FP if g(p) \u223c p 2 in such a way that g\u0303(p) tends to a constant g\u0303\u2217 .\nMore generally, assume that at a given scale k, physics is described by the tree level expansion of\na kind of \"Wilsonian effective action\" \u0393k which already contains the effect of loops, the integration\nover the loop momenta having been extended down to the scale k. (For this reason we will\nsometimes refer to the scale k as an \"IR cutoff\".) We assume that the \u0393k has the most general\nform allowed by the symmetries of the theory and that it can be parametrized as in (5) (or (7) in\nthe case of gravity), where gi (k) are essential renormalized couplings. The word \"essential\" here\nrefers to the fact that any couplings that can be eliminated by means of field redefinitions, such\nas the wave function renormalization constants Z, do not affect physical observables and therefore\nneed not be considered for our argument. We define g\u0303i = gi (k)k\u2212di , where di is the canonical\ndimension of gi . These dimensionless numbers are the essential couplings measured in units of k.\nWe say that the theory has a fixed point if all the g\u0303i tend to finite limits g\u0303i\u2217 when k \u2192 \u221e.\nIf such a FP exists, and the physical world is described by a RG trajectory that hits the FP\nwhen k \u2192 \u221e, then all the renormalized couplings remain finite when measured in units of k, and\nthe theory has a sensible UV limit. The important question then is: how many such trajectories\nexist? This question is important because if it turned out, for example, that all trajectories end at\nthe FP, then we would be in the same situation as with a nonrenormalizable theory: in order to\ndetermine what trajectory the real world corresponds to, we would have to measure separately each\nof the infinitely many couplings of the theory, and the theory itself would have little predictive\npower, if any at all. At the other extreme, the best possible case would be if there existed a\nsingle such trajectory, because then the demand of having a good UV limit would constrain all\nthe couplings, up to one parameter telling us the energy scale corresponding to a particular point\non the trajectory. In order to describe the general case, define the UV critical surface to be the\nset of points in parameter space that is attracted to the FP in the UV limit. For the field theory\ndescription to be valid up to arbitrarily high energy, the real world must correspond to a point in\nthis surface. If the UV critical surface is finite dimensional, then finitely many experiments are\n\n6\n\n\fsufficient to determine our position in it. Then, the theory is completely pinned down and we can\nuse it to make predictions.\nTo summarize: a theory that has a FP with finitely many attractive directions has a sensible\nUV limit and is predictive. Such a theory is called \"asymptotically safe\" [10]. QCD is the prime\nexample; in this case the FP corresponds to a free theory and one has the added bonus that perturbation theory becomes better and better as energy increases. But it is clear that an asymptotically\nsafe theory would be perfectly sensible even if the FP was not free. In this case perturbation theory\nmay be of limited use (if the FP is not too far away from the free theory FP) or of no use (if the\nFP corresponds to a strongly interacting theory).\nV.\n\nSIMPLE CALCULATIONS\n\nThe nonlinear sigma models and gravity have very similar perturbative behaviour. Do these\ntheories have a FP with the properties that are needed for asymptotic safety in d = 4? Various\napproximation schemes have been applied, and together they provide support for this hypothesis.\nOne approach that has been pursued is to truncate the effective action \u0393k , i.e. keeping only a finite\nnumber of terms in the expansions (5) or (7), and to gradually increase the number of term. For\nhistorical reasons, more work has been done on gravity than on the NLSM, so that the evidence\nfor asymptotic safety is now stronger for the former than for the latter. Here I will mention only\nthe evidence that is presently available for both theories, which amounts to truncating the effective\naction to the lowest terms, those at most quadratic in derivatives. I refer to [11] for more detailed\nreviews and references.\nAs mentioned in the preceding section, we must first make sure that the action is parametrized\njust by essential couplings, i.e. that one cannot eliminate them by field redefinitions. Here the\ndifference between the two theories manifests itself. In the case of the NLSM, if we try to absorb\nthe coupling 1/g2 by a redefinition of the field, as in (2), then g reappears in the internal metric\nh\u03b1\u03b2 , as in the expansion (3). Thus g is clearly an essential coupling. On the other hand, as we\nhave already mentioned, in the case of the Hilbert action (6) the field (in this case the metric)\nalso appears in the volume element and in the contraction of indices. As a consequence the effect\nof rescaling the field is quite different and Newton's constant can be completely absorbed by the\nredefinition g\u03bc\u03bd \u2192 16\u03c0Gg\u03bc\u03bd (the Ricci tensor is not affected by this redefinition). The reason why\nG can still be considered an essential coupling is that, uniquely among field theories, a rescaling\nof the metric also affects the definition of the cutoff and if we decide to use the cutoff as the unit\nof energy, as was implicit in our preceding discussion, then such a rescaling is not allowed [12].\nSo it is true also in gravity, when parametrized by the Hilbert action and using cutoff units, that\nNewton's constant is an essential coupling.\nThe tool that has been used in the last ten years or so to calculate the beta functions of\nthese nonlinear theories is a form of Exact Functional Renormalization Group Equation (FRGE)\nintroduced by Wetterich [13]. This is a very powerful and versatile tool, which by now has been\napplied to a large variety of problems [14], but since it is not yet very widely known, there may be\nthe impression that in order to see the appearance of a FP in gravity one has to resort to somewhat\nesoteric methods. But this is not so: one can see the FP already in the lowest order of perturbation\ntheory. Both in gravity and in the NLSM, restricting ourselves to the terms with two derivatives,\nthe coefficient g2 that multiplies the action has dimension of massd\u22122 . Therefore the leading term\nin the beta function is expected to be of the form\nk\n\n\u2202g2\n= B1 kd\u22122 ,\n\u2202k\n\n(8)\n\nwhere B1 is a calculable numerical coefficient. (In a direct calculation of the effective action, this\n7\n\n\fbeta function would show up as a power law divergence.) The (square of the) perturbative coupling\nconstant is proportional to the inverse of g2 : g2 = 1/2g2 . Therefore its beta function is of the form\nk\n\n\u2202g2\n= \u22122B1 g 4 kd\u22122\n\u2202k\n\nand the beta function of the dimensionless coupling g\u0303 2 = g 2 kd\u22122 is\nk\n\n\u2202g\u0303 2\n= (d \u2212 2)g\u03032 \u2212 2B1 g\u03034 .\n\u2202k\n\n(9)\n\nA nontrivial, UV attractive fixed point will exist provided B1 > 0. This then is the basic mechanism\nfor the appearance of a FP. Of course, since the FP may correspond to a relatively large value\nof the coupling, one cannot in general give too much weight to this perturbative result. It is for\nthis reason that one has to resort to a more powerful method such as the FRGE. In practice, the\nactual calculation based on the FRGE is somewhat similar to the one loop calculation, but the\napproximation upon which it is based does not rely on the coupling being small. This makes it an\nideal tool to explore the notion of asymptotic safety.\nThere is a way of approximating the truncated FRGE that will reproduce exactly the one loop\nresult: it consists in neglecting the running of the couplings in the r.h.s. of the equation. When\nthis is applied to the NLSM or to gravity, one gets (9). The truncated FRGE without this one\nloop approximation yields a result of the form:\n2B1 g\u0303 4\ndg\u0303 2\n= (d \u2212 2)g\u03032 \u2212\n,\ndt\n1 \u2212 B2 g\u0303 2\n\n(10)\n\nwhere B2 is another calculable numerical coefficient. Further improvements in the applications\nof the FRGE consist not in adding higher loops formed with the two derivative operator, but in\nadding the contributions of higher derivative operators. One should not expect these additional\ncontributions to be numerically small. However one may hope that at least the results for the\nFP-values and the critical exponents of the lower order operators are not dramatically shifted by\nthe addition of the new operators. For some evidence that in gravity this is indeed the case, I refer\nto the talk by C. Rahmede.\nA.\n\nNonlinear sigma model\n\nLet me now give some explicit results, starting from the NLSM. The application of the FRGE\nmakes use of background field techniques developed in [15]. Here we follow [16]. Having chosen\na (not necessarily constant) background \u03c6\u0304, for each x one can find a unique vector \u03be(x) tangent\nto \u03c6\u0304(x) such that \u03c6(x) is the point on the geodesic passing through \u03c6\u0304(x) and tangent to \u03be(x),\nthe distance from \u03c6\u0304(x) being equal to |\u03be(x)|. One should think of \u03be as an element of the space of\nsmooth sections C \u221e (\u03c6\u0304\u2217 T N ), and we write \u03c6(x) = Exp\u03c6\u0304(x) \u03be(x), where Exp is the exponential map.\nThe action for \u03c6 can be rewritten as S(\u03c6) = S\u0304(\u03c6\u0304, \u03be). The second variation of the action yields an\noperator \u2206 acting on \u03be by \u2206(\u03be)\u03b1 = \u2212D\u0304 2 \u03be \u03b1 \u2212\u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u0304\u03b3 \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6\u0304\u03b4 R\u0304\u03b1 \u03b3\u03b2\u03b4 \u03be \u03b2 , where D\u0304\u03bc \u03be \u03b1 = \u2202\u03bc \u03be \u03b1 +\u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u0304\u03b3 \u0393\u0304\u03b3 \u03b1 \u03b2 \u03be \u03b2\nis the covariant derivative constructed with the Christoffel symbols of h\u03b1\u03b2 , and R\u0304\u03b1\u03b3\u03b2\u03b4 its Riemann\ntensor.

Chiral perturbation theory applies near the origin.\n\nthat the covariant derivative transforms in the same way as \u03be under diffeomorphisms of N . One\ndefines an IR cutoff by adding to the bare action a nonlocal term of the form\nZ\n1\ndd x h\u03b1\u03b2 \u03be \u03b1 Rk (\u2212D\u0304 2 )\u03be \u03b2 ,\n(12)\n\u2206Sk (\u03c6\u0304, \u03be) = 2\n2g\nfor a suitable profile function Rk (z) which goes to zero sufficiently fast for z > k, and to k for\nz \u2192 0. The beta function of g12 h\u03b1\u03b2 is then given by the FRGE as a trace of a certain function of\nthe operator \u2212D\u0304 2 . At one loop one finds in general that it is proportional to the Ricci tensor [16].\nIf there are any symmetries, the flow will preserve them. To see this, let g be an element of the\nsymmetry group G and Lg the diffeomorphism of N corresponding to g. Since h\u03b1\u03b2 is G-invariant,\nalso its connection is, so Lg maps the geodesic through y tangent to \u03be to the geodesic through Lg (y)\ntangent to T Lg (\u03be) [17]: Lg (Expy (\u03be)) = ExpLg (y) (T Lg (\u03be)). We call \u03c6\u2032 = Lg \u25e6 \u03c6 the transform of \u03c6\nunder g and \u03be \u2032 = T Lg (\u03be) the transform of \u03be under g. Then \u03c6\u2032 = Lg (Exp\u03c6\u0304 \u03be) = ExpLg (\u03c6\u0304) (T Lg \u03be) =\nExp\u03c6\u0304\u2032 \u03be \u2032 . There follows that\nS\u0304(\u03c6\u0304\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 ) = S(\u03c6\u2032 ) = S(\u03c6) = S\u0304(\u03c6\u0304, \u03be) ,\n\n(13)\n\ni.e. the background field action S\u0304 is G-invariant provided both background and quantum field are\ntransformed. Furthermore, we have \u2212D\u0304 \u20322 (\u03be \u2032 ) = T Lg (\u2212D\u0304 2 (\u03be)) or abstractly \u2212D\u0304 \u20322 = T Lg \u25e6 (\u2212D\u0304 2 ) \u25e6\n2\n\u2032\nT L\u22121\ng . There follows that if \u03be is an eigenvector of \u2212D\u0304 with eigenvalue \u03bb, then \u03be is an eigenvector\n\u20322\n2\nof \u2212D\u0304 with the same eigenvalue. Therefore the spectrum of \u2212D\u0304 is G invariant. The FRGE gives\nthe scale variation of \u0393k (\u03c6\u0304) as a sum over eigenvalues of \u2212D\u0304 2 , so it follows from the argument\nabove that \u2202t \u0393k (\u03c6\u0304) is G-invariant. This implies that if the starting action \u0393k0 (\u03c6\u0304) is G-invariant,\nalso the action at any other k is.\nNow assume that N is a D-dimensional maximally symmetric space, which implies that R\u03b1\u03b3\u03b2\u03b4 =\nR\n(h\nD \u03b1\u03b2 h\u03b3\u03b4 \u2212 h\u03b1\u03b3 h\u03b2\u03b4 ), where R is the curvature scalar. Modulo trivial redefinitions, we can assume\nthat h\u03b1\u03b2 is normalized so that |R| = D(D \u2212 1) 4 and the only running coupling is g. One then\n4\n\nif R > 0 this corresponds to a sphere of unit radius; the case R = 0 is obviously of no interest.\n\n9\n\n\ffinds\nB1 = cd\n\nR\n;\nD\n\nB2 = 2cd\n\nR\n;\nD(d + 2)\n\ncd =\n\n1\n(4\u03c0)d/2 \u0393\n\nd\n2\n\n\u0001 ,\n+1\n\n(14)\n\nA FP will exist if R > 0. If we neglect B2 , this reproduces old one loop results of [3, 18] for\nd = 2 + \u01eb. If d > 2 there is a nontrivial FP at g\u0303\u22172 = 2cdd\u22122\n(D\u22121) . For large R (which in the case of\nthe sphere means large D) it occurs at small coupling, where perturbation theory is reliable. The\none loop critical exponent is \u2212 d\u03b2\n= d \u2212 2. Since B2 > 0, its effect is to shift the FP to smaller\ndg\u0303\n\u2217\n\n2\n\n\u22124)\nvalue g\u0303\u22172 = 2c(d\nand to produce a negative pole in the beta function at g 2 = \u22121/B2 . This\nd d(D\u22121)\npole should be of no consequence, since we imagine the theory to evolve from the nontrivial FP in\nthe UV to the free FP in the IR (where \u03c7PT applies). The other effect of B2 is to make the beta\nfunction at the FP steeper, changing the critical exponent to \u2212 d\u03b2\n= 2d(d\u22122)\ndg\u0303\nd+2 . In d = 4, this gives\n\u2217\n\nthe mass critical exponent \u03bd = 3/8. Figure 1 gives the beta function of the S 3 \u2013model in d = 4.\nB.\n\nGravity\n\nLet us now come to gravity in d dimensions [19]. In this case one has to take into account the\ncomplications that follow from the presence of a gauge group. We assume that the theory has been\ngauge fixed in the de Donder gauge, with gauge parameter \u03b1 = 1. Also, one has to make some\nspecific choice for the way in which the cutoff is imposed. We choose a cutoff of type Ia, in the\nlanguage of [20]. The beta function gets contributions from gravitons and from the ghosts. It is\ngiven by equations (10), with\nB1 =\n\n4(d3 \u2212 15d2 + 12d \u2212 48)\n;\n3(4\u03c0)d/2 d \u0393( d2 )\n\nB2 =\n\n4(d2 \u2212 9d + 14)\n.\n3(4\u03c0)d/2 (d + 2)\u0393( d2 )\n\nand the identification, g2 = \u22128\u03c0G. Due to this minus sign, the FP now exists for B1 < 0, which is\nindeed the case for all d. In particular at one loop for d = 4 we find B1 = \u221211/3\u03c0. It is interesting\nthat this FRGE\u2013based calculation agrees qualitatively with a one loop calculation in [21] who give\nthe following formula for the scale-dependence of Newton's constant:\n\u0015\n\u0014\n167 G0\n,\nG(r) = G0 1 \u2212\n30\u03c0 r 2\nHere r is the distance between two gravitating point particles. If we identify k = 1/ar, with a a\nconstant of order one, this would correspond to a beta function\n\u03b2G\u0303 = 2G\u0303 \u2212 a2\n\n167 2\nG\u0303 .\n15\u03c0\n\n(15)\n\nThe difference in the numerical coefficient highlights that the position of the FP is not universal.\nRather, in these calculations, it depends on details of how the cutoff is imposed, which are akin to\nrenormalization scheme dependence in perturbation theory.\nDue to the minus sign in the relation between g2 and G, and given that B2 < 0 for 2 < d \u2264 6,\nthe effect of the correction term in the denominator is again to produce a negative pole in the beta\nfunction at finite G\u0303 > G\u0303\u2217 , but the effect on the FP is rather modest, as seen in figure 2.\n\n10\n\n\f\u0392\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n\u008e\nG\n\n-0.5\n\nFIG. 2: The gravitational one loop beta function (upper curve) and the beta function extracted from the\ntruncated FRGE (lower curve).\nC.\n\nOther truncations\n\nIn order to emphasize the similarity with the NLSM, we have discussed here only the Hilbert\naction. But gravity differs from the NLSM in that there can be a term in the action that does\nnot contain derivatives of the field, namely the cosmological term. From the point of view of\nrenormalization theory this term is \"more relevant\" than the Hilbert term. In the presence of the\ncosmological constant, B1 and B2 become polynomials in \u039b\u0303 = \u039b/k2 . The vacuum energy density\n\u039b/(8\u03c0G) depends quartically on k, and the beta function of \u039b\u0303 itself has the general form\nA1 + 2B1 \u039b\u0303 + G\u0303(A1 B2 \u2212 A2 B1 )\nd\u039b\u0303\n= \u22122\u039b\u0303 + G\u0303\ndt\n2(1 + B2 G\u0303)\nwhere A1 and A2 are also polynomials in \u039b\u0303. The coupled system of beta functions has a FP at\npositive values of G\u0303 and \u039b\u0303, and since the critical exponents form a complex conjugate pair, the\ntrajectories approach the FP with a spiralling motion. I refer to [20] for more details.\nThe similarity between the NLSM and gravity extends also to the case when four derivative\nterms are taken into account. In d = 4 at one loop, in both theories the coefficients g4 of equations\n(5) and (7) grow logarithmically, so that their inverses, which are the couplings in a perturbative\naxpansion, are asymptotically free. This was shown in a series of papers for gravity [22] and in [23]\nfor the NLSM. However, in these papers essential use is made of dimensional regularization, in such\na way that information about power-law divergences, and the corresponding running couplings, is\nlost. In the case of gravity, the behaviour of the relevant couplings (the cosmological constant\nand Newton's constant) in these one loop renormalizable and asymptotically free theories has been\nanalyzed using the FRGE at one loop in [24] and it was found that they tend to a nontrivial FP\nthat is not too far from the one that one finds in the Einstein\u2013Hilbert truncation. More recently\nit has been shown that when one uses the FRGE beyond the one loop approximation, also the\ncouplings g4 tend to finite limits, so that in a four derivative truncation gravity is asymptotically\nsafe but not asymptotically free, contrary to the one loop results [25]. Similar calculations for the\nNLSM are in progress. In the case of gravity it has also been possible to study higher truncations,\nprovided one restricts one's attention to powers of the curvature scalar R [20, 26]. In the case of\nthe NLSM, this would be analogous to studying actions that contain only powers of Tr(U \u22121 dU )2 .\nIn a somewhat different line, the gravitational RG flow has also been studied in the approximation\n11\n\n\fwhere only the conformal degree of freedom is retained, yielding various interesting results [27].\nFinally we mention that a gravitational FP has been found also using the \u01eb expansion around\nd = 2 [28] and the 1/N expansion [29]; this is again entirely analogous to well known results for\nthe NLSM [18].\nVI.\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nEinstein's theory and the NLSM have much in common. At low energies they can be treated\nperturbatively as effective field theories, and I have argued that both gravity and certain NLSMs\nmay be asymptotically safe. If this was the case, then the range of validity of both theories could\nextend beyond their natural cutoff scale, in principle up to arbitrarily high energy scales.\nIn general one would expect that the effective action at the FP \u0393\u2217 has a very complicated\nstructure, with infinitely many nonzero couplings. Still, the theory could make definite predictions.\nFor example, suppose the critical surface has dimension d and is not parallel to any of the axes.\nWe can choose the first d couplings g1 , . . . gd as independent variables, and express the remaining\nones as functions of these:\ngk = gk (g1 , . . . gd ) ;\n\nfor k = d + 1, d + 2, . . .\n\nIn practice by solving the linearized flow equations one can determine the tangent space to the\ncritical surface at the FP:\ngk = gk\u2217 +\n\nd\nX\ni=1\n\nCki (gi \u2212 gi\u2217 ) ;\n\nfor k = d + 1, d + 2, . . .\n\n(16)\n\nFor an example of an explicit calculation of this type in a nine-parameter approximation to the\ngravitational effective action, I refer again to the contribution by C. Rahmede. These equations\nare predictions for the behaviour of the theory at high energy, that in principle could be tested:\none would have to determine the first d couplings by means of d independent measurements,\nand subsequent experiments can determine whether, for example, the coupling gd+1 satisfies the\nprediction.\nIs it reasonable to expect that at the FP only finitely many directions are UV attractive? In a\nlocal quantum field theory there is only a finite number of relevant operators, whose corresponding\ncouplings have positive mass dimension. Assuming that the quantum corrections are finite, at\nmost a finite number of couplings could switch from relevance to irrelevance or vice\u2013versa. This\nexpectation is supported by the calculations referred to previously.\nLet us now mention possible phenomenological applications of this scenario. There is not much\nmotivation to try to push the pion NLSM beyond its natural cutoff: we know that at high energies\nthe pions cannot be treated as fundamental particles. Within \u03c7PT itself, as one goes towards\nhigher energies, one would have to take into account the heavier mesons, and that would change its\ncharacter drastically. For example, the interpretation of the \u03c3 meson is as the radial component of\na scalar multiplet, and that turns the nonlinear theory into a linear one. The situation is much less\nclear in the electroweak version of \u03c7PT, where the pions are replaced by the electroweak Goldstone\nbosons (three of the degrees of freedom of the complex Higgs doublet), and the pion decay constant\nis replaced by the VEV \u03c5 = 246 GeV. The existence of these Goldstone degrees of freedom has\nalready been established: they correspond to the longitudinal components of the W and Z particles.\nThe general expectation is that a fourth scalar degree of freedom will be found; according to the\nstandard model, it is a fundamental scalar field. There is no compelling argument against this\npicture, but in principle there is also the possibility that no new degrees of freedom will be found\n12\n\n\fat colliders beyond those that we already know. If this was the case up to sufficiently high energy\nscales, then this could be a signal of an asymptotically safe NLSM.\nWhile there is no shortage of models for physics beyond the TeV scale, all containing the\nstandard model in the appropriate limit, there is no quantum field theory valid at and beyond the\nPlanck scale which likewise subsumes the standard model plus Einstein's theory of gravity. There\nis therefore a much stronger motivation for studying asymptotic safety in the case gravity. From\nthis point of view one could still see studies of the NLSM as theoretical exercises where some of\nthe complications of gravity, e.g. those related to the gauge structure, are absent.\nWhat would one observe if gravity was asymptotically safe? There have been some studies of the\nphenomenological signatures of asymptotic safety in gravity [30]. They have considered mosty the\ncase of large extra dimensions, where the Planck scale is lowered so much that it might be accessible\nto future collider experiments. However the same arguments hold also in the four dimensional case,\njust scaling the Planck mass back to its \"normal\" value. It seems more likely that the effects of\nasymptotic safety could be detected in early cosmology or in some extreme astrophysical setting.\nFor some work alomg these lines I refer to the talk by A. Bonanno.\nOne advantage of the asymptotic safety scenario is that the FP regime could be the continuation\ntowards higher energies of the low energy theory that we are already familiar with, without having\nto change the field content. Although this is not the only possibility, there could be a smooth\ntransition from the low energy regime, where all the dimensionful couplings are constant, and \u03c7PT\napplies, to the fixed point regime, where all the dimensionless couplings are constant. In the case\nof gravity, this would guarantee, by construction, that the UV theory near the FP corresponds\nexactly to gravity at low energy, a fact that is not at all obvious in other, \"top down\" approaches\nto quantum gravity. In this connection we should also mention that the asymptotic safety scenario\nneed not exclude other \"top down\" descriptions of quantum gravity. In order to make contact with\nreality, any such theory must first yield a low energy effective field theory, and this field theory\nmust match at low energies the \u03c7PT we know. So, another use of predictions such as (16) is to\ncheck agreement with the top down approaches directly at high energy, near the FP regime. If\nsome sort of agreement could be established, then we would have much more confidence in both\npictures. Conversely, we observe that the top down approaches are typically based on a choice of\n\"classical\" action, which cannot be directly identified with the FP effective average action \u0393\u2217 . The\ntask of reconstructing the bare action at some UV cutoff scale \u039b from the effective average action\n\u0393\u039b (in the limit \u039b \u2192 \u221e) has been discussed in [31].\nNote added. The beta functions of a NLSM with four derivative interactions have been studied\nat one loop in [32].\nAcknowledgements. I would like to thank D.
