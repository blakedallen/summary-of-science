The discovery of the split attractor flow and of walls of\nmarginal stability [1, 2, 3] and the corresponding issue of microstate BH counting [4]-[6], have been\nsome remarkable achievements in this field, also characterized by some puzzling and yet not fully\nunderstood features, such as anti-marginal stability and entropy enigmas (see also [7]-[17]; for studies\non N > 2, see [18]-[20]). Earlier studies on composite (super)gravity solutions and marginal stability,\nwere done in [21], while [22] provides a recent review on wall-crossing formulae.\nThis paper continues the investigation of geometric aspects of BH physics, by exploiting the (classical) duality symmetries of the underlying supergravities [23], which are the continuum limit of the\nU-duality [24] governing the non-perturbative string dynamics, in the context of two-centered BH\nsolutions. The ultimate aim is to show that different aspects of multi-centered BH dynamics are\nencoded into different values of (and constraints among) certain multi-centered duality polynomial\ninvariants. These duality invariants characterize some multi-centered charge orbits, which generalize\nthe electric-magnetic charge orbits encoding all the main features of single-centered BH solutions, such\nas the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy [25], the ADM mass [26] and the BPS (supersymmetry-preserving)\nproperties [27, 28, 29, 30].\nThe single-centered orbits [27] are known to provide a stratification of the space of the irrep.\nR of the d \u0001= 4 classical U -duality group G4 of the f -dimensional electric-magnetic charge vector\nQ \u2261 p\u039b , q\u039b (\u039b = 1, ..., f /2). Analogously, the p-centered orbits are expected to stratify the space\nR1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Rp , for p BH constituents, with electro-magnetic fluxes given by\n\u0001\n\u039b\nQM\na = 1, . . . , p, , M = 1, . . . , f .\n(1.1)\na \u2261 pa , q a \u039b\nInterestingly, it has been recently uncovered [31, 32] that a p (> 2)-centered BH solution in d = 4\nspace-time dimensions enjoys an \"horizontal\" symmetry SLh (p, R) among the centers of the BH\nconstituents. As a consequence of this symmetry, further invariant polynomials in the charges beside\nthe usual U -duality invariants acquire an important role, and they provide a tool to achieve a finer\nclassification of the allowed two-centered configurations1 .\n1\n\nThe horizontal symmetry has recently been investigated within the fascinating connections with Quantum Information Theory in [33]\n\n1\n\n\fAs commented in [32], the analysis can be performed for a generic number p of centers, but, due\nto the structure of the split flow in multi-center (super)gravity solutions [1, 2, 3, 4], the case p = 2\nis already fully illustrative, at least regarding marginal stability. It is then natural to explore the\ncharge orbits for the horizontal doublet (Q1 , Q2 ), and to classify the allowed quantum numbers for the\nextremal BH two-centered compounds by suitable invariant constraints among horizontal invariantpolynomials.\nFor p = 2, the simplest example of such \"horizontal invariants\" is provided by the symplectic\nproduct of two charge vectors [1, 32]\n1\nQN CM N \u01ebab ,\nW \u2261 hQ1 , Q2 i = QM\n2 a b\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere a, b = 1, 2, CM N is the symplectic metric\nCM N \u2261\n\n\u0012\n\n0 \u2212I\nI 0\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(1.3)\n\nand \u01eb is the usual SL (2, R) \u223c Sp (2, R) rank-2 invariant tensor. By considering (Q1 , Q2 ) as a doublet\nQa (spin s = 1/2, fundamental irrep. 2) of SLh (2, R) [31], it is evident from (1.2) that W is manifestly invariant under both the U -duality and the horizontal symmetry. It is known that W enters the\ndescription of many physical properties of the two-centered BH compound states, such as the equilibrium distance between the two centers, the intrinsic overall (orbital) angular momentum, and the\nmarginal stability condition [1, 3]. Indeed, a crucial feature of two-centered BH physics is that their\nphysical properties turn out to depend not only on Q1 + Q2 , as for the BPS ADM mass [34], but also\non other combination of charges, such as the symplectic product (1.2). Another important instance\nis the entropy at the (split) horizon, which is the sum of the entropies of the two single-centered BH\nconstituents [3]:\np\nS1+2 p\n= |I4 (Q1 )| + |I4 (Q2 )|,\n(1.4)\n\u03c0\nwhere I4 is the unique quartic invariant polynomial of the irrep. R of the U -duality group G4 ,\nI4 (Q) =\n\n1\nKM N P Q QM QN QP QQ ,\n2\n\n(1.5)\n\nand KM N P Q is the so-called K-tensor [35]. As a natural two-centered generalization of the quartic\ninvariant I4 (Q), for p = 2 one considers the contraction of the K-tensor with four a priori different\ncharge vectors, which gives rise to the symmetric Iabcd tensor [31, 32], sitting in the spin s = 2 irrep.\n5 of SLh (2, R):\n1\nN P Q\n(1.6)\nIabcd \u2261 KM N P Q QM\na Qb Qc Qd .\n2\nIf G4 is a simple group, one can define the symmetric object in the horizontal indices [32]\n\u03b1\nN\nT(ab)\n= t\u03b1M N QM\na Qb\n\n(1.7)\n\nwhere t\u03b1M N (\u03b1 = 1, ..., d \u2261dimR (Adj (G4 ))) is the symplectic representation of the generators of the\nLie algebra g4 of G4 . Using these tensors, one has\nI(abcd) = \u2212\n\n1 \u03b1\n1 \u03b1\nN P Q\nt (M N t\u03b1|P Q)QM\nT T\na Qb Qc Qd = \u2212\n6\u03c4\n6\u03c4 (ab \u03b1|cd)\n\n(1.8)\n\nwhere \u03c4 is a model-dependent parameter [35]:\n\u03c4\u2261\n\n2d\n.\nf (f + 1)\n2\n\n(1.9)\n\n\fA similar structure arises also when G4 is a semisimple group factorized as SL(2, R) \u00d7 SO(m, n),\ncharacterizing the reducible symmetric models listed in Table 1. Indeed, within the so-called CalabiVesentini basis [36, 37] symplectic frame, one can define the T-tensor [31]\n\u0013\n\u0012\nT11 T12\n,\n(1.10)\nT(ab)[\u039b\u03a3] = p\u039b(a qb)\u03a3 \u2212 q\u039b(a pb)\u03a3 =\nT12 T22 \u039b\u03a3\nwhere indices are raised with the the pseudo-Euclidean SO(m, n) metric \u03b7\u039b\u03a3 . This is a symmetric\nobject in the horizontal indices, whose components are the triplet of T-tensors of the reducible models\n(called T1 , T2 , T12 in [31]). They constitute a two-centered generalization of the product T\u039b\u03a3 =\np\u039b q\u03a3 \u2212 q\u039b p\u03a3 , which appears in the single-centered fourth order invariant written as [38, 39, 40]\n\u0001\n1\n1\nI4 = T\u039b\u03a3 T\u0393\u2206 \u03b7 \u039b\u0393 \u03b7 \u03a3\u2206 = \u2212 Tr\u03b7 T2 = p2 q 2 \u2212 (p * q)2 ,\n2\n2\n\n(1.11)\n\nwhere \"Tr\u03b7 \" denotes the \u03b7-trace, namely the trace in which the indices are contracted with \u03b7. For\ntwo centers, in reducible models it generalizes to\n\u0001\n1\n1\nIabcd = T(ab|\u039b\u03a3 T|cd)\u0393\u2206 \u03b7 \u039b\u0393 \u03b7 \u03a3\u2206 = \u2212 Tr\u03b7 T(ab Tcd) .\n2\n2\n\n(1.12)\n\nThe study of two-center extremal BH charge orbits associated to a generic horizontal doublet Q1 , Q2\nhas been initiated in[31, 32]. It was found that in d = 4 supergravity theories with symmetric scalar\nmanifolds and for generic charge vectors for each of the two centers, the dimension of a complete basis\nof U -duality invariant-polynomials is seven, and it includes both the horizontal singlet W and the\nquintet Iabcd . The minimum number of invariant polynomials has been shown to decrease to four if\nonly polynomials invariant under both U -duality and horizontal symmetry are taken into account. The\ndimension of this G4 \u00d7 SLh (2, R) invariant basis further reduces in some specific cases, for instance,\nfor some rank-2 and rank-1 symmetric scalar manifolds pertaining to the so-called st2 and t3 , N = 2,\nd = 4p\nmodels, and for theories whose BH charge irrep. admits a quadratic invariant polynomial\n|I2 | = |I4 |, namely, N = 2 minimally coupled[50] and for N = 3 supergravity theories [41], which\nwill not be dealt with in this paper. Interestingly, the \"pure\" N = 4, d = 4 supergravity, despite\nhaving a scalar manifold SL(2,R)\nU (1) of rank 1, has a complete basis formed by seven duality invariants\n[31].\nThe present investigation completes the previous analysis in that it determines the restrictions and\nconstraints on such invariants when at least one of the two centers is occupied by a \"small\" black hole,\nhaving I4 (Q) = 0. Small black holes, corresponding to horizonless solutions in Einstein two-derivatives\n(super)gravity, have zero entropy and they don't show an attractor behavior [27]. However, they are\nan interesting sector of the BH spectrum that has been recently examined in [42, 29], in particular\nregarding the different supersymmetry features of the allowed orbits.\nLarge black hole charge orbits, with I4 6= 0 are described by a minimum of four charges, and in this\nsense the corresponding orbits are \"rank four\". More precisely, the rank of the orbit (or of the charge\nvector Q spanning it) is here the minimal number of charges which compose an orbit representative.\nMathematically speaking, this defines the rank of Q as element of the associated Freudenthal triple\nsystem [43, 44]. However, large orbits can become \"lightlike\" when they satisfy the condition I4 = 0,\nand their rank reduces to three. If a further differential constraint \u2202I4 /\u2202Q = 0 is imposed, the\nrank further reduces to two (critical orbits), and it becomes one for doubly-critical orbits, having a\nsuitable projection of \u2202 2 I4 /(\u2202Q)2 vanishing [45]. In Sec. 2 we shall revisit and add new results to\nthe manifestly U -invariant constraints defining the rank, ranging from 4 to 1, of the single-centered\ncharge vector Q, which gives rise to the stratification of the representation space of the U -duality\ngroup. When combining two centers, these constraints will clearly reflect in a number of combinations\nfor the orbits of the compound system, which will be thoroughly investigated.\n3\n\n\fIn Sec. 3 we shall deal with relations and properties of the invariant polynomials characterizing\na two-centered (extremal) BH compound, which admit a natural interpretation and classification in\nterms of the horizontal symmetry group SLh (2, R).\nThen, the results of Secs. 2 and 3 are used to perform a detailed analysis of all possible twocentered (extremal) BH charge configurations, by considering all possible combinations of the ranks\nof the charge vectors Q1 and Q2 pertaining to the two single-centered BH constituents.\nThis analysis is carried out for all supergravity theories (with symmetric scalar manifold) whose\nd = 4 U -duality group G4 is a \"group of type E7 \", namely a group with a symplectic representation\nR admitting a completely symmetric rank-4 invariant structure q such that the invariant polynomial\nI4 can be defined as2 [47]\nI4 (Q) \u2261\n\u2261\n\n1\nq (q1 , q2 , q3 , q4 )|q1 =q2 =q3 =q4 \u2261Q\n2\n1\nKM N P QQM QN QP QQ .\n2\n\n(1.13)\n\nIt is also worth recalling that the \"group of type E7 \" G4 is a symmetry group of Jordan algebra-related\nstructures, namely:\nG4 \u223c Aut (M (J3 )) \u223c Conf (J3 ) ,\n(1.14)\nwhere Aut (M (J3 )) is the automorphism group of the vector space M (J3 ) \u2261 R\u2295R\u2295J3 \u2295J3 constructed\nover the Euclidean rank-3 Jordan algebra J3 , whose conformal group is Conf (J3 ) (see e.g. [48, 49]\nfor recent reviews and lists of Refs.). On the other hand, the G4 's of minimally coupled N = 2 , and\nN = 3 [51] supergravities, omitted in this investigation, do not enjoy an interpretation in terms of\n(rank-3 Euclidean) Jordan algebras.\nThe groups of type E7 G4 's (which are U -duality groups of supergravity theories in d = 4 spacetime dimensions with symmetric scalar manifolds) may be grouped into two classes, depending on\nwhether G4 is a semisimple Lie group, or it is a simple Lie group itself. The former case, analyzed in\nSec. 4, corresponds to the reducible symmetric models, whose scalar manifolds3 are grouped into two\ninfinite sequences, reported in Table 1. The first (n = 1) element of the N = 2 sequence in Table 1,\nnamely the so-called st2 model, is non-generic, and it deserves a separate treatment, given in Sec. 4.2.\nThe corresponding two-centered (extremal) BH charge orbits with both Q1 and Q2 \"large\" have been\nstudied in [31]. Generally, the number of independent G4 -invariant is seven, and a complete basis can\nbe taken to be [31]\nW, X , Iabcd ,\n(1.15)\nwhere the quartic polynomial X is defined by Eq.

It will be emphasised in Sec. 3 that the existence of X in reducible\nmodels can be traced back to the semi-simple nature of the U -duality group G4 , giving rise to two\nindependent quartic polynomials I\u2032 and I\u2032\u2032 with vanishing horizontal helicity, and related to I0 by Eq.\n(3.9).\nThe outcome of this analysis is that the number of independent duality- and horizontal- invariant\npolynomials is decreased when one or both charge vectors are \"small\", since the vanishing of the\nquartic form (1.5) for one center or both gives rise to various polynomial relations among otherwise\nindependent invariants. For example, as yielded by the analysis of Secs. 4 and 5, if at least one of the\ntwo charge vectors Q1 and Q2 is doubly-critical (i.e. rank 1, see Sec. 2; in the N = 8 language, this is\n1\n2 -BPS), then only one independent horizontal invariant, say the symplectic product W (1.2), exists.\nThis is one of the few examples known in the literature [3].\nNotice that the results concerning the st2 and t3 models are consistent with the \" stu \u2192 st2 \u2192 t3\nreduction\" (see e.g. the discussion in [52, 53, 31], and the recent analysis in [33]).\nFinally, in Sec. 6 we make some comments on some \"small + small\" two-centered charge configurations corresponding to I4 (Q1 + Q2 ) < 0, i.e. to a BH compound that, regarded as a single-centered\nsolution, is a \"large\" non-BPS (extremal) BH, making contact with recent literature, such as [11] and\n[54].\n\n2\n\nU -Invariant Constraints on Q\n\nWe start by giving a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 (with original results) of the U -invariant constraints defining the charge\norbits of a single-center (extremal) BH, namely of the G4 -invariant conditions defining the rank of\nthe dyonic charge vector Q \u2208 R as an element of the corresponding Freudenthal triple system (FTS)\n(see [43, 44], and Refs. therein); as mentioned above, G4 is the d = 4 U -duality group \"of type E7 \"\n[47], and R is its relevant BH charge irrep.. The symplectic indices M = 1, ..., f (f \u2261dimR R (G4 )) are\nraised and lowered with the symplectic metric CM N defined by (1.3). By recalling the definition (1.5)\nof the unique (quartic) G4 -invariant polynomial constructed with Q \u2208 R, the rank of a non-null Q as\nan element of F T S (G4 ) range from four to one, and it is manifestly G4 -invariantly characterized as\nfollows:\n1. rank (Q) = 4: \"large\" extremal BHs, with non-vanishing area of the event horizon:\nI4 (Q) \u2277 0.\n\n(2.1)\n\n2. rank (Q) = 3: \"small\" lightlike extremal BHs, with vanishing area of the event horizon:\nI4 (Q) = 0;\n\u2202I4\n6= 0 \u21d4 KM N P Q QN QP QQ 6= 0, at least for some M .\n\u2202QM\n\n(2.2)\n(2.3)\n\n3. rank (Q) = 2: \"small\" critical extremal BHs:\n\u2202I4\n\u2202QM\n\u2202 2 I4\n\u2202QM \u2202QN\n\n= 0 \u21d4 KM N P Q QN QP QQ = 0, \u2200M ;\n\n(2.4)\n\n6= 0, at least for some M, N .\n\n(2.5)\n\nAdj(G4 )\n\n4. rank (Q) = 1: \"small\" doubly-critical extremal BHs [45, 64]:\n\u2202 2 I4\n\u2202QM \u2202QN\n\n= 0 \u21d4 (3KM N P Q + CM P CN Q ) QP QQ = 0, \u2200M, N.\nAdj(G4 )\n\n6\n\n(2.6)\n\n\fLet us consider the doubly-criticality condition (2.6) more in detail.

For clarity's sake, we report the explicit expressions of\neabc (3.1) (the\nthe various components of Iabcd , as well as their relations with the components of Q\nsubscripts \"+2, +1, 0, \u22121, \u22122\" denote the horizontal helicity of the various components [31, 32]):\nE\nD\ne111 , Q1 ;\n(3.2)\nI+2 \u2261 I4 (Q1 ) \u2261 I1111 = Q\nD\nE D\nE\ne111 , Q2 = Q\ne112 , Q1 ;\nI+1 \u2261 I1112 = Q\n\nD\nE D\nE\ne112 , Q2 = Q\ne122 , Q1 ;\nI0 \u2261 I1122 = Q\n\nD\nE D\nE\ne122 , Q2 = Q\ne222 , Q1 ;\nI\u22121 \u2261 I1222 = Q\n\nD\nE\ne222 , Q2 .\nI\u22122 \u2261 I4 (Q2 ) \u2261 I2222 = Q\n\n(3.3)\n(3.4)\n(3.5)\n(3.6)\n\nNote that in reducible symmetric models, due to the semi-simple nature of G4 , there are two independent components of Iabcd with vanishing horizontal helicity, namely I\u2032 and I\u2032\u2032 [31]:\n1\nI\u2032 \u2261 \u2212 Tr\u03b7 (T11 T22 ) ;\n2\n\u0001\n1\nI\u2032\u2032 \u2261 \u2212 Tr\u03b7 T212 ,\n2\n\n(3.7)\n(3.8)\n\nand related to I0 by the relation (4.4) of [31]:\nI0 =\n\n\u0001\n1 \u2032\nI + 2I\u2032\u2032 .\n3\n\n(3.9)\n\nThus, one can consider the following symplectic product of spin 3/2 horizontal charge tensors:\nD\nE\neabc , Q\nedef \u2261 Q\neM |abc Q\neN |def CM N .\nQ\n(3.10)\n8\n\n\fD\nE\neabc , Q\nedef should project onto spin s = 3, 2, 1, 0 irreps. of SLh (2, R) itself; however, due\nA priori, Q\nto the complete symmetry of the K-tensor (and to the results of [47, 35]), the projections on spin\ns = 3 and 1 do vanish:\nD\nE\ne(abc , Q\nedef ) = 0;\ns = 3: Q\n(3.11)\nE\nD\ne(ab|c , Q\ned|ef ) \u01ebcd = 2 WIabef ;\ns = 2: Q\n(3.12)\n3\nE\nD\ne(a|bc , Q\nede|f ) \u01ebbd \u01ebce = 0;\n(3.13)\ns = 1: Q\nD\nE\neabc , Q\nedef \u01ebad \u01ebbe \u01ebcf = 8I6 ,\ns = 0: Q\n(3.14)\n\nwhere the symplectic product W is defined by (1.2), and in (3.14) the definition of the sextic horizontal\npolynomial I6 [32] (given by Eq. (3.24) of [32]) has been recalled:\nD\nD\nE\nE\nE\n1De\nedef \u01ebad \u01ebbe \u01ebcf = 1 Q\ne111 , Q\ne222 + 3 Q\ne122 , Q\ne112 .\n(3.15)\nQabc , Q\nI6 \u2261\n8\n4\n4\nD\nD\nE\nE\ne111 , Q\ne222 \u2212 3 Q\ne122 , Q\ne112 consistently turns\nThe complementary relation to (3.15), namely 41 Q\n4\nout to be proportional (through W) to the zero helicity component of Iabcd ; indeed, by setting\n(a, b, e, f ) = (1, 1, 2, 2) in (3.12), one obtains:\nD\nE\nE\n1De\n1\ne222 \u2212 3 Q\ne122 , Q\ne112 .\n(3.16)\nQ111 , Q\nI0 W =\n2\n4\n4\nFurthermore, at least in reducible symmetric models (listed in Table 1), the sextic invariant is\nnaturally defined within the T-tensor formalism as follows (see Sec. 3 of [31] for further detail):\nI\u20326 = \u2212Tr\u03b7 (T11 T22 T12 ) .\n\n(3.17)\n\nAs denoted by the prime, I\u20326 (3.17) does not coincide with the I6 given by (3.14) (or equivalently by\n(3.15)); indeed, irreducible and reducible symmetric models, the following relation respectively holds:\n1 3\nW ;\n12\n1\n1\n= I\u20326 + W 3 + X W.\n12\n6\n\nI6 = I\u20326 +\n\n(3.18)\n\nI6\n\n(3.19)\n\nThis can be traced back to a crucial difference (pointed out in Sec. 3 of [32]) between reducible\nand irreducible symmetric models, concerning the horizontal invariant polynomial (of degree four in\ncharges) X . In reducible models, X is defined by Eq. (4.13) of [31]:\n\u0001\n1\nX \u2261 Tr\u03b7 T212 \u2212 Tr\u03b7 (T11 T22 ) \u2212 W 2 ,\n2\n\n(3.20)\n\nand it generally does not vanish. On the other hand, in irreducible models it is defined by Eq. (3.10)\nof [32], and it vanishes identically:\nXirred = 0.\n(3.21)\nThus, it is here worth remarking that the relations (3.11)-(3.16) hold both in irreducible models\n(characterized by (3.21) and in reducible models (generally having non-vanishing X (3.20)). On the\nother hand, in presence of X 6= 0, I\u20326 undergoes the renormalization I\u20326 \u2192 I\u20326 + 61 X W, and this explains\nEq. (3.19) from Eq. (3.18).\nBefore analyzing and classifying the two-center extremal BH configurations and the corresponding\ndefining constraints in terms of G4 - and [SLh (2, R) \u00d7 G4 ]- invariant polynomials, in light of previous\n9\n\n\fdefinitions and findings, we conclude this Section by pointing out some consequences of the rank\nof a charge vector, say Q1 , on the set of G4 - and [SLh (2, R) \u00d7 G4 ]- invariant polynomials of the\ntwo-centered configuration (Q1 , Q2 ), both in irreducible and reducible symmetric models:\nrank (Q1 ) = 3 \u21d2 I+2 = 0;\n\ne111 = 0 \u21d2\nrank (Q1 ) = 2 \u21d2 Q\n\nrank (Q1 ) = 1 \u21d2\n\n(3.22)\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 I+2 = I+1 = 0;\n\uf8f3\n\nI\u20326 = \u2212 12 I0 W \u2212\n\n1\n3\n12 W\n\n\u2212 16 X W \u21d4 I6 = \u2212 21 I0 W;\n(3.23)\n\n\uf8f1\nI+2 = I+1 = 0;\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 I0 = \u2212 61 W 2 ;\n\n\uf8f4\n1\n\uf8f4\nW 3;\nI\u20326 = 0 \u21d4 I6 = \u2212 12 I0 W = 12\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nX = 0 (in reducible models).\n\n(3.24)\n\n\u00c7a va sans dire that analogous relations, involving components of opposite horizontal helicity, hold\nfor Q2 . Eqs. (3.22)-(3.24) will be used extensively in Secs. 4 and 5 (as given by (3.21), X = 0\nidentically in reducible models). The non-generic cases of st2 and t3 N = 2, d = 4 models will be be\nconsidered in Secs. 4.2 and 5.2, respectively.\n\n4\n\nReducible Models\n\nAs given by Table 1, the reducible symmetric d = 4 supergravity models5 have the following d = 4\nU -duality group:\n\uf8f1\nG4 = SLv (2, R) \u00d7 SO (m, n)\n\uf8f2 2 (N = 2, n \u2208 N) ;\nm=\nm\n(4.1)\n\uf8f3\nSLh (2, R) \u00d7 G4 \u223c SOhv (2, 2) \u00d7 SO (m, n) ,\n6 (N = 6, n \u2208 N\u222a {0}) ,\n\nwhere the isomorphism (see Sec. 8 of [31])\n\nSLh (2, R) \u00d7 SLv (2, R) \u223c SOhv (2, 2)\n\n(4.2)\n\nhas been used. The corresponding scalar manifolds thus belong to the sequence ST [m, n], of particular\nrelevance for superstring compactifications (see e.g. the analysis in Sec. 3.1 and App. C of [68], and\nRefs. therein).\nWe now give a complete analysis of all possible two-center charge configurations (Q1 , Q2 ) (with\nsymplectic product (1.2) W 6= 0, i.e. mutually non-local), by providing for each configuration a\n\"minimal\" sets of independent G4 -invariant and [SLh (2, R) \u00d7 G4 ]-invariant polynomials. The analysis\nwill be carried out in the bare charges Q basis, by exploiting, for each of the two centers, the dualityinvariant definitions of rank of Q recalled in Sec. 2. The definitions and notation of [31] are used. The\nprototype of a generic (N = 2) reducible symmetric model is the stu model, studied in some detail in\nSec. 2 of [31]. The non-generic case of the N = 2, d = 4 st2 model is considered in Sec. 4.2.\n\n4.1\n\nGeneric Reducible Models\n\n1. (Q1 , Q2 ) = (rank 4, rank 4).

On the other hand, the number of\nindependent [SLh (2, R) \u00d7 G4 ]-invariant is four, and one can choose a complete basis to be [31]\n\u0001\n\u0001\n[SLh (2, R) \u00d7 G4 ] -inv (# = 4) : W, X , T r I2 , T r I3 ,\n(4.3)\nwhere\nTr I2\n\n\u0001\n\n= I+2 I\u22122 + 3I20 \u2212 4I+1 I\u22121 ;\n\u0001\nTr I3 = I30 + I+2 I2\u22121 + I\u22122 I2+1 \u2212 I+2 I\u22122 I0 \u2212 2I+1 I\u22121 I0 .\n\n(4.4)\n(4.5)\n\nDifferent choices are of course possible.

Furthermore, (an analogue with Xirred = 0 of) the polynomial\nconstraint (4.8) does not hold in these models. As discussed in [32], the number of independent\nG4 -invariant is seven, a complete basis can be taken to be given by Eq. (1.16). On the other\nhand, the number of independent [SLh (2, R) \u00d7 G4 ]-invariant is four, and one can choose the\nfollowing complete basis [32]:\n\u0001\n\u0001\n[SLh (2, R) \u00d7 G4 ] -inv (# = 4) : W, I6 , T r I2 , T r I3 .\n(5.1)\nAs for the reducible models analyzed in Sec. 4, different choices are of course possible.

(6.12), (7.18), (7.17) and (7.16) of [31] (see also App. A therein, and the\nanalysis in [33]), which we recall here:\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\n8\n0 = 16T r 2 I2 + 64T r I3 W 2 + T r I2 W 4 \u2212 W 8 ;\n3\n27\n\u0001\n0 = 24I\u20326 W \u2212 12T r I2 + W 4 ;\n\nX\n\n= 0.\n\n(5.25)\n\nNote that in (5.25) X \u2261 Xirred , and its identical vanishing consistently characterizes the t3 model\n\u2032\nas a non-generic irreducible symmetric model. Due to\n\u0001 (5.25), I6 3and\n\u0001 I6 are related through Eq.\n2\n(3.18). By means of (5.25), (5.25) and (3.18), T r I and T r I can be expressed in terms of\nthe horizontal invariants of the basis (5.24).\n2. (Q1 , Q2 ) = (rank 3, rank 4):\nSLv (2, R) -inv (# = 4) :\n\nW, I6 , I\u22122 , I+1 ;\n\n(5.26)\n\nSOhv (2, 2) -inv\n\nW, I6 .\n\n(5.27)\n\n(# = 2) :\n\n3.

This charge configuration has been considered in [3]. The complete\nduality and horizontal bases can respectively be taken to be\nSLv (2, R) -inv (# = 2) :\n\nW, I\u22122 ;\n\n(5.30)\n\nSOhv (2, 2) -inv\n\nW.\n\n(5.31)\n\n(# = 1) :\n\n6\n\nThis charge configuration has been considered in literature [4, 6] but, within SLv (2, R)-invariant polynomials (see\ne.g. the second possible basis of (5.23)), the role of I6 is not completely clear yet (concerning this, see the recent study\nin [33]).\n\n17\n\n\fBy recalling (5.25)-(5.25), in the t3 model the configuration (Q1 , Q2 ) = (rank 2, rank 4) implies\n\uf8f1\n(3.18)\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nW 3;\nI\u20326 = 0 \u21d4 I6 = 12\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 I0 = \u2212 16 W 2 < 0;\n(5.32)\n\u0001\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n1\n2\n4\n\uf8f4 Tr I = W ;\n\uf8f4\n12\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u0001\n\uf8f3\n1\nT r I3 = \u2212 216\nW 6.\n\nConsistent with the fact that the t3 model can be obtained as a \"rank-1 degeneration\" (see e.g.\n[52, 53, 31]) of the reducible symmetric N = 2, d = 4 models, (5.32) matches the X = 0 limit of\nsubcases I (4.19) and II (4.20) or, equivalently, it matches the subcase III (4.24).\n5. (Q1 , Q2 ) = (rank 2, rank 3). The complete duality and horizontal bases can be taken to coincide,\nand W is the only relevant invariant polynomial in charges:\nSLv (2, R) -inv and SOhv (2, 2) -inv (# = 1) : W.\n\n(5.33)\n\n6. (Q1 , Q2 ) = (rank 2, rank 2). Again, the complete duality and horizontal bases can be taken to\ncoincide and be given by (5.33).\nSince the t3 model lacks of an independent doubly-critical \"small\" charge orbit (namely, criticality\nimplies doubly-criticality in this model; see e.g. [69] for a recent account within a d = 3 timelikereduced formalism), the cases given by points 7, 8, 9 and 10 are all missing for this model.\n\n6\n\nA Comment on Bound States with Negative Discriminant\n\nThe treatment given in Secs. 4 and 5 allows one to discuss in fair generality two-centered extremal\nBH compound states with a given value of I4 (Q1 + Q2 ). Here, we would like to comment shortly\non some two-centered charge configurations corresponding to a negative I4 (Q1 + Q2 ), i.e. to a BH\ncompound that, regarded as a single-centered solution, is a \"large\" non-BPS (extremal) BH.\nBy recalling the sum rule (cf. Eq. (4.7) of [31])\nI4 (Q1 + Q2 ) = I+2 + 4I+1 + 6I0 + 4I\u22121 + I\u22122 ,\n\n(6.1)\n\nfrom the analysis of previous Secs. one can single out some two-charge configurations which necessarily\nimply\nI4 (Q1 + Q2 ) = \u2212W 2 < 0.\n(6.2)\nNote that in this case I4 (Q1 + Q2 ) becomes horizontal invariant, as well.\nFor all symmetric reducible models (see Table 1), these configurations are the ones with\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 (2, 2)III ;\nreducible : rank (Q1 , Q2 ) =\n(1, 2) ;\n\uf8f3\n(1, 1) ,\n\n(6.3)\n\nnamely the subcase III of point 6, and points 9 and 10 of Sec. 4.1 (and analogue cases for the\nnon-generic st2 model treated in Sec. 4.2).\nFor generic irreducible models, these configurations are the ones in which at least one center is\ndoubly-critical, namely the ones with\n\u001a\n(1, 2) ;\nirreducible : rank (Q1 , Q2 ) =\n(6.4)\n(1, 1) ,\n18\n\n\fi.e. points 9 and 10 of Sec. 5.1. In the non-generic irreducible t3 model, treated in the Sec. 5.2,\nthe unique configuration of the kind under consideration is given by rank (Q1 , Q2 ) = (2, 2) (point 6\nabove), because, as mentioned in Sec. 5.2, in such a model criticality implies doubly-criticality.\nAs an illustrative example (which can be realized in heterotic string theory), let us consider the\n\"small + small\" two-centered charge configuration (in Calabi-Vesentini symplectic frame [37]; \u039b =\n1, ...., m + n)\n\u0001\nQ1 \u2261 p\u039b , 0 ; Q2 \u2261 (0, Q\u039b )\n(6.5)\n\nin d = 4 supergravity coupled to n vector multiplets (N = 2 and N = 4 theories are obtained for\nm = 2 and 6, respectively), implying that7 [38, 39, 40]\nI4 (Q1 + Q2 ) = I4 (p, Q) = p2 Q2 \u2212 (p * Q)2 .\n\n(6.6)\n\nFrom the analysis of single-centered charge orbits [70, 42, 29], the charge vector Q1 of (6.5) enjoys the\nfollowing properties, depending on the nature of the SO (m, n)-vector p\u039b :\np2 \u2261 p\u039b p\u03a3 \u03b7\u039b\u03a3 > 0 \u21d2 Q1 rank = 2, 12 -BPS;\np2 < 0 \u21d2 Q1 rank = 2, non-BPS;\n\n(6.7)\n\np2 = 0 \u21d2 Q1 rank = 1, 12 -BPS,\nand the same holds for Q2 of (6.5), by replacing p\u039b with Q\u039b (\u03b7 is the SO (m, n) metric). By using\ne.g. the formulae derived of [31], one can easily compute that in the heterotic charge configuration\n(6.5) there unique two independent horizontal-invariant polynomials read:\n1\nW = \u2212p * Q 6= 0; X = \u2212 p2 Q2 \u22da 0,\n2\n\n(6.8)\n\nwhere the two centers are assumed to have mutually non-local fluxes (and thus it is assumed that\nW=\n6 0).\nBy considering both Q1 and Q2 of configuration (6.5) to be timelike or spacelike (this corresponds\nto rank (Q1 , Q2 ) = (2, 2)II , given by subcase II of point 6 of Sec. 4.1)), and recalling the analysis\ndone in the second part od Sec. 4 of [32], one obtains the case study reported in Table 3 (in which\nthe cases with I4 (Q1 + Q2 ) = 0 have been disregarded), in which the sign of I4 (Q1 + Q2 ) (second\ncolumn) is equivalent to the constraint on X (third column), because it holds that\nI4 (Q1 + Q2 ) = I4 (p, Q) = \u2212W 2 \u2212 2X .\n\n(6.9)\n\nOn the other hand, when p\u039b and/or Q\u039b of (6.5) are lightlike (or, equivalently, when Q1 and/or Q2\nare rank 1; see Eq. (6.7)), namely in the mutually non-local cases\np2 > 0, Q2 = 0 : rank = (2, 1) ;\np2 = 0, Q2 > 0 : rank = (1, 2) ;\np2 = 0, Q2 = 0 : rank = (1, 1) ,\n\n(6.10)\n\nI4 (Q1 + Q2 ) is strictly negative (because X = 0), and it is given by Eq. (6.2). Note that for the cases\n(6.10) I4 (Q1 + Q2 ) = 0 is equivalent to mutually local centers.\nThus, the two-centered charge configurations (Q1 , Q2 ) of the heterotic type (6.5) given by the\nsecond, fourth, fifth and sixth line of Table 3, and by Eq. (6.10), are all characterized by the corresponding BH compound that, regarded as a single-centered (extremal) BH, is \"large\" and non-BPS,\n7\nIn string theory, the quartic invariant I4 (Q) of reducible models is usually named \"discriminant\" of the charge\nvector Q (see e.g. [71]).\n\n19\n\n\f\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\nsgn p2 , sgn Q2\n\nsgn (I4 (Q1 + Q2 ))\n\n(+, +)\n\n+\n\nX < \u2212 12 W 2\n\n(+, +)\n\n\u2212\n\nX > \u2212 12 W 2\n\n(\u2212, \u2212)\n\n+\n\nX < \u2212 21 W 2\n\n(\u2212, \u2212)\n\n\u2212\n\nX > \u2212 12 W 2\n\n(+, \u2212)\n\n\u2212\n\n(\u2212, +)\n\n\u2212\n\nconstraint\n\nX >0\n\nX >0\n\nhorizontal\norbit O/SOhv (2, 2)\nSO(m,n)\nSO(m\u22122,n)\n\nSO(m,n)\nSO(m\u22121,n\u22121)\n\nSO(m,n)\nSO(m,n\u22122)\n\nSO(m,n)\nSO(m\u22121,n\u22121)\n\nSO(m,n)\nSO(m\u22121,n\u22121)\n\nSO(m,n)\nSO(m\u22121,n\u22121)\n\nTable 3: Two-centered charge configuration of the type (6.5) with rank (Q1 , Q2 ) = (2, 2)II in reducible\nsymmetric models (N = 2 and N = 4 supergravity theories are obtained for m = 2 and m = 6,\nrespectively). The cases with I4 (Q1 + Q2 ) = 0 are not considered.\nwith a negative quartic duality invariant I4 (Q1 + Q2 ). These configurations are (the semiclassical\nlimit, with real, continuous charges of) some of the cases recently analyzed by Sen in8 [54] in N = 4,\nd = 4 supergravity; furthermore, the case rank (Q1 , Q2 ) = (1, 1) encompasses the D0 + D6 configuration in the N = 2 stu model, which has been studied in [11]. Since both (6.2) and (6.9) are\nmanifestly horizontal-invariant expression, the most general supporting two-centered configurations\ncan be computed by acting on the relevant case of the heterotic configuration (6.5) with a generic\n[SOhv (2, 2) \u00d7 SO (m, n)]-transformation (also, recall (4.2)).\n\nAcknowledgments\nA.
