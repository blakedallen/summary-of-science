A standard and fruitful procedure to\ndescribe the large scale properties of inclusions in a soft\nmedium consists in integrating out the numerous \"solvent\" degrees of freedom via ensemble averaging [1, 5].\nThe interaction between the embedded particles is then\ndescribed by \"effective potentials\". The latter can modify the genuine interparticles interactions (Coulomb, van\nder Waals,...) or give rise to entirely new effects. For instance, in some (equilibrium) cases, the external objects\ndo not modify the ground state energy of the medium\nbut only alter its thermal-fluctuations spectrum. The resulting entropic effective interaction has consequently an\namplitude proportional to the thermal energy kB T and a\nrange comparable to that of the correlations of the fluctuations of the medium [6, 7]. Such fluctuation-induced\n(i.e. entropic) interactions are commonly referred to as\nthermal Casimir interactions in analogy with their famous quantum equivalent [8].\nMore recently, many experimental studies have reported the organization of particles embedded in fluids\nwhen the latter are driven out of equilibrium by the application of external fields: [9, 10, 11, 12]. Extensions of the\nconcepts of \"effective potential\" and \"entropic forces\" to\nout of equilibrium situations have been scarce [12, 13, 14].\nIndeed effective potentials can not be simply derived from\na free energy in an out-of-equilibrium context, and only\nthe instantaneous force acting on the external objects\nfor a given configuration of the medium can be defined.\nThe effective interactions between the host objects should\nthen strongly depend on the dynamics ruling the temporal evolution of the medium (in contrast to the equilibrium Casimir case).\nIn this paper, we attempt to extend the paradigm of\nCasimir effective interactions to objects immersed in soft\nsystems \"shaken\" by external energy sources that can\n\nB\n\nC\n\nFIG. 1: Sketch of the three shaking processes discussed in the\npaper.

We use a model,\ndetailed in section II, where both the medium and the\nobjects are very simple. (i) The hosting medium is described by a scalar free field \u03c6 living in a d dimensional\nspace (d = 1, 2, 3): for instance, \u03c6 could represent the\nheight profile of a fluid interface (d = 2) or a contact\nline (d = 1) [15], or the angular deviation of the director\nof a nematic liquid crystal (d = 3) [16]. (ii) The external objects are two identical rigid parallel plates that\nenforce a zero field on their surfaces (Dirichlet boundary conditions). Among the numerous possible choices\nfor the shaking sources, we explore three different cases\nof experimental relevance (c.f. Fig. 1): (A) a localized\nmonochromatic shaking, (B) an uniform monochromatic\nshaking, (C) a spatially uncorrelated colored noise. All\nthese shaking induce effective interactions between the\nplates, which we characterize in section III by the corresponding average forces, discussing their sign, amplitude and range. We compare these features with those\nof the usual thermal Casimir effect. The detail of the calculations and a more thorough analysis of the shakinginduced interactions are gathered in section IV. This\nmore technical section also includes some comments on\nthe time dependence and fluctuations of these shaking-\n\n\f2\ninduced forces.

Their thickness plays no role\nin all that follows and will be set to 0. The soft medium\nis modeled by a scalar field \u03c6 associated to the elastic\nHamiltonian :\nZ\ni2\n\u03ba d~ h\n~\nd R \u2207\u03c6(R)\n,\n(1)\nH=\n2\n\n~ = (x, r) where x is the\nwith \u03ba the elastic modulus and R\ncoordinate normal to the plate, see Fig. 2. \u03c6 is taken\ndimensionless.\nWe restrict ourselves to strong plates-field interactions,\nmodeled by Dirichlet boundary conditions (DBC) on the\nplates: \u03c6(x = 0, r) = \u03c6(x = L, r) = 0.\nWe first focus our attention on the force F > that the\nsoft medium exerts on the right hand side of the plate\nlocated at x = 0. For a given configuration of the elastic\nfield, F > is given by the integral over r of the stress tensor component Txx (r) [20]. The components Tij of this\nstress tensor can be obtained by the virtual displacement\nmethod taking into account the DBC [6]. In the present\n2\ngeometry, Txx (r) = \u2212 12 \u03ba [\u2202x \u03c6(0+ , r)] , so that\nZ\n\u03ba\ndr [\u2202x \u03c6(0+ , r)]2 .\n(2)\nF> = \u2212\n2\nNote that this force pushes the plate toward the negative\nx direction whatever the field conformation.\nThe net force F on the plate is the algebraic sum of\nthe contributions of the two sides: F \u2261 F > + F < . The\nforce F < is given by a formula similar to Eq. (2), so that:\nF =\u2212\n\n\u03ba\n2\n\nZ\n\ndr [\u2202x \u03c6(0+ , r)]2 +\n\n\u03ba\n2\n\nZ\n\nFIG. 2: Two parallel plates, perpendicular to the x axis, separated by a distance L shorter than their lateral extension\nLk .\n\nHere \u03b3 is a generalized friction coefficient.\nA description of the dynamics of the plates is beyond\nthe scope of this paper, and we assume that they are\nfixed. L is thus a constant. After partial Fourier transform with respect to t and r, equations (4,5) can be recast\ninto:\nZ L\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(6)\ndx\u2032 R>\n\u03c6\u03c9,q (x) =\n\u03c9,q (x, x )\u03b7\u03c9,q (x ),\n0\n\nwhere the response function R> corresponds to the diffusion kernel in the slab geometry with DBC and with\na diffusion constant \u03ba/\u03b3. The Fourier\ntransforms used\nR\nin thisR paper are defined by fq \u2261 dr f (r) exp(iq.x) and\ng\u03c9 \u2261 dt g(t) exp(i\u03c9t).\nA generalization of our results obtained with (4,5)\nto other slow dynamics that obey an equation of the\nform (6) with a different kernel will be commented upon\nthroughout the text. This generalization is simple provided the dynamic linear response of \u03c6 relates spatial and\ntemporal scales through an algebraic relation l\u03c9 \u223c \u03c9 \u22121/z ,\nwhere l\u03c9 is the spatial extension of the elastic distortion\nresulting from a localized periodic shaking of pulsation\n\u03c9, and z is the so-called dynamical exponent. The diffusive model described above by Eq. (4,5) indeed fits in\nthis picture with z = 2 and:\n\u22121/2\n\nl\u03c9 = [(\u03b3/\u03ba)\u03c9]\n\ndr [\u2202x \u03c6(0\u2212 , r)]2 .

An alternative approach is to consider the model Langevin\ndynamics for the field given by Eq.(4,5), with \u03b7 a thermal Gaussian white noise of zero mean and of variance\n\n\f3\n~ t)\u03b7(R\n~ \u2032 , t\u2032 )i = 2\u03b3kB T \u03b4(R\n~ \u2212R\n~ \u2032 )\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ). Averaging\nh\u03b7(R,\nover realizations of the noise leads to the same universal\nexpression for the net thermal Casimir force [6]:\nLd\u22121\nk\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n(8)\n\n10\n\nwith Ad = (d \u2212 1)\u0393(d/2)\u03b6(d)/(4\u03c0)d/2 . This universal\nmean force describes a long range attraction that depends\non the temperature of the heat bath but not on specific\nmaterial properties such as \u03ba and \u03b3.\nWe now calculate the average forces generated by the\nthree non-thermal shaking processes mentioned in the\nintroduction, with a field \u03c6 that evolves according to\nEq.

Moreover\nthe geometry is here totally symmetrical so that the force\nfelt by the plate at x = L is: \u2212F . Denoting FA> the time\naveraged force for this process, and anticipating on the\ndetailed discussion of section IV-A, we use Eq.

The latter induces static\ndeformations of lateral extension L on the plate. Thus,\nFA> scales as \u03b7s2 a2d /(\u03baLd\u22121 ) independently of the shaking\nperiod. In contrast, the dynamic length is much smaller\nthan the plate-shaker distance if L/l\u03c9s \u226b 1. The elastic\ndeformations are exponentially screened before reaching\nthe plates surfaces. Therefore, the force amplitude decays exponentially as shown in Fig. 3.\nIn summary, a localized periodic shaking induces an effective interplate interaction. Whereas FCasimir is universal and leads to an attraction between the two plates, the\ninteraction obtained here is repulsive and does depend\nboth on the elastic modulus of the surrounding\"fluid\"\nand on its dynamics (through l\u03c9s ). Finally, both the\nrange and the amplitude of the present shaking-induced\nforce can be externally tuned by varying the pulsation \u03c9s\nand the amplitude \u03b7s of the shaking. The dependence of\nthe force on the shaker position as well as its fluctuations\nwill be discussed in section IV.\n\nB.\n\nAverage force induced by a uniform\nmonochromatic shaking\n\n1\n\nAgain l\u03c9s = [(\u03b3/\u03ba)\u03c9s ]\u2212 2 is the dynamical length associated with the shaking pulsation \u03c9s . The adimensional function \u03a5A (1/2, L/l\u03c9s ) is plotted in Fig. 3, and\nits general expression (including the shaker position dependence) is given below in Eq. (23).\nTwo different limit regimes can be identified: If\nL/l\u03c9s \u226a 1, the shaking period is much larger than the relaxation of any interplate field excitation, so that the elastic deformations generated at x = L/2 propagate along\nthe x axis up to the plates surfaces. In this quasistatic\n\nWe now suppose that the elastic medium is everywhere\nperiodically and homogeneously shaken:\n~ t) = \u03b7s cos(\u03c9s t).\n\u03b7(R,\n\n(11)\n\nPosible experimental realizations include: the homogeneous and periodic shaking of a metallic elastic line using a magnetic field [17] or the driving of an interface\nbetween two dielectic liquids using AC electric fields [18].\n\n\f4\n\n2\n\n10\n\n0.2\n0\n\n10\n\n0.1\n-2\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n0\n\n3\n\n9\n\n6\n\n-3\n\n12\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\nFIG. 4: Uniform monochromatic shaking.

The full line corresponds to\nd = 3, the dashed line to d = 2 and the dotted line to d = 1.\n\nOne may also use flexoelectric effects in liquid crystal to\ngenerate such a shaking process [19].\nBy symmetry the two plates feel opposite instantaneous forces. The exact expression for the time averaged\nforce FB on the x = 0 plate is computed in section IV:\n\ntunable unlike their equilibrium analog. Their sign, amplitude and range can all be controlled externally by varying the shaking period and amplitude.\n\nFB =\n\n\u03b7s2 Ld\u22121\nk\n\u03ba\n\nC.\n\nl\u03c92 s \u03a5B\n\n\u0012\n\nL\nl\u03c9s\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nThe dimensionless quantity \u03a5B , see Eq. (30), is plotted in\nFigure 4: it is non-monotonic and changes sign periodically. Given the plates geometry and the shaking translational invariance, the net normal stress FB /Ld\u22121\ndepends\nk\nneither on the plates lateral extension Lk nor on the dimension d. The fast and slow shaking asymptotics can\nthus be qualitatively inferred from dimensional analysis.\nIf the medium is slowly shaken (L/l\u03c9 \u226a 1), the net force\namplitude diverges as l\u03c92 s \u223c 1/\u03c9s . First, notice that a\nconstant uniform source \u03b7s between the plates induces an\nhomogenous normal stress on the inner side of the plate\n(x = 0+ ) that scales necessarily as FB> /Ld\u22121\n\u223c \u03b7s2 \u03ba\u22121 L2 .\nk\nSecond, on the left hand side of the plate (x < 0), l\u03c9s\nis the only length scale available to construct the normal\n\u223c \u03b7s2 \u03ba\u22121 l\u03c92 s . In this slow shaking regime\nstress FB< /Ld\u22121\nk\nthis latter contribution dominates, so that \u03a5B plateaus\nto a finite value. Turning now to the L/l\u03c9 \u226b 1 limit,\nif the interplate distance goes to infinity, the two sides\nof the plate face identical semi infinite media. Consequently, they are pushed in opposite directions with the\nsame amplitude and thus feel on average no net force.\nSo, in this limit L/l\u03c9 \u226b 1 that also corresponds to fast\nshaking at fixed L, FB decays to zero, as observed in Fig.\n(4).\nReturning to the most remarkable features, Fig. 4 and\nEq. (12) show that the fluctuations of a uniformally\nshaken medium induce effective interplate forces that\nstrongly differ from FCasimir . They are indeed completely\n\nAverage force induced by a stochastic shaking:\ncolored noise\n\nFinally the case of stochastic shaking sources is considered. As mentioned above, if \u03b7 is the white Langevin\nnoise modeling the coupling to a heat bath, the resulting field fluctuations induce thermal Casimir interactions\nbetween the plates. Any other noisy shaking drives the\nsystem out of equilibrium. Numerous examples of elastic\nmaterials shaken by \"active\" stochastic processes are provided by biological systems, e.g. active membranes [11],\nactin-myosin gels [21], etc.\nWithout attempting to describe accurately the\nspecifics of the noise in a given system, we focus here on\nthe simple case of a spatially uncorrelated colored noise\nof zero mean, seeking for the influence of its color on the\ninterplate force generated. We describe the fluctuations\nof this noise by:\n~ t)\u03b7(R\n~ \u2032 , t\u2032 )i = \u03b7 2 ad S(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\u03b4(R\n~ \u2212R\n~ \u2032 ), (13)\nh\u03b7(R,\ns\nwhere the correlation S(t) is defined by its Fourier transform S\u03c9 , also referred to as the noise power spectrum:\nS\u03c9 =\n\n\u03a92s\n\n\u03a9s\n.\n+ \u03c92\n\n(14)\n\nIn Eq. (13) a is a microscopic distance chosen so that\n~ t)i = \u03b7s2 . Again\nthe mean squared noise satisfies h\u03b7 2 (R,\n\u03b7s has the dimension of an energy density. The white\nnoise limit corresponds to \u03a9s \u2192 \u221e, with \u03b7s2 ad \u03a9\u22121\nkept\ns\nconstant.\n\n\f5\nPSfrag replacements\n\nThe mean net force FC on the x = 0 plate is exactly\ncomputed in section IV-C:\nd\u22121\n\n\u03b7 2 ad L k\n\u03a5C\nFC = s\n\u03ba Ld\u22122\n\n\u0012\n\nL\nl\u03a9s\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(15)\n\n2L\n3L\n\u2212L\n\u22122L\n\n0\n\nL\n\nx\n\n\u03a5A (L/L\u03c9s )\n\nThe dimensionless ratio \u03a5C /Ad is plotted in Fig. 5, using Eq. (33). We recall that Ad measures the amplitude of the thermal Casimir force (Ad = (d \u2212\n1)\u0393(d/2)\u03b6(d)/(4\u03c0)d/2 ).\nPostponing a more involved discussion to next section,\nwe emphasize here three points. First, the color of the\nnoise has no influence on the sign of the force: the two\nplates attract each other whatever \u03a9s and \u03b7s . Second,\n\u03a5C decreases monotonically with L/l\u03a9s , in other words\nthe larger the noise correlation time \u03a9\u22121\ns , the stronger\nthe force felt by the two plates. Third, Fig. (5) indicates\nthat \u03a5C (u)/Ad decays as 1/(2u2 ) when u \u226b 1. This\nimplies that the attraction is long-ranged and decays only\nalgebraically with the interplate distance. A connection\nwith the Casimir result appears in this regime: if one\nsets \u03b7s2 ad \u03a9\u22121\n= 2\u03b3kB T , then in the limit white noise\ns\nlimit \u03a9s \u2192 \u221e, FC converges as expected to FCasimir =\nAd kB T Ld\u22121\n/Ld .\nk\nTo conclude, we have shown that Casimir-like attractions can be induced by colored noisy shaking. These\nattractions decay algebraically at long distance as in the\nthermal case and contrary to the two former monochromatic cases. Their amplitude depend explicitly on the\nmaterial properties and their scaling on the noise color.\n\nIV.\n\n0\n\nSHAKING-INDUCED FORCES : DETAILED\nANALYSIS.\n\nIn this section we provide a more detailed analysis of\nthe interactions induced by the three kind of shakings: in\naddition to the explicit derivation of the average of the\ncorresponding forces, we also comment on their temporal\nfluctuations.\nWe start with the derivation of the tool that will allow us to compute the forces on the x = 0 plate in\nall situations, namely the linear response function \u2202x R\nof the field's gradient at the surface of the plate to a\npoint-like shaker in the medium (by definition, the kernel R is the solution of the dynamic equations (4,5), with\n~ t) = \u03b4(R\n~ \u2212R\n~ \u2032 )\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 )). We compute this quan\u03b7(R,\ntity using an image method which conveys an intuitive\npicture [23]: as in electrostatics, these equations can be\nsolved replacing the constraint at the boundaries (5) by\nthe addition of an ad hoc distribution of image sources\noutside the integration domain.\nWe consider first a shaking source located in the interplate region 0 < x\u2032 < L and compute the response\n\u2202x R> on the x = 0+ side of the plate. In the present\nslab geometry, the images are the mirror images of the\noriginal source through virtual reflecting planes located\n\nFIG. 6: Distribution of the image sources for the two plates\ngeometry and Dirichlet boundary conditions. The filled circle\nis the original source and the dashed circles its mirror images\n\nat x = nL as depicted in Fig. 6. Consequently, the re\u2032\nsponse R>\n\u03c9,q (x, x ) can be expressed as an infinite sum\nover all the images contributions:\nX\n\u2032\nR>\nR\u03c9,q (2nL + x\u2032 \u2212 x)\n(16)\n\u03c9,q (x, x ) =\nn\u2208Z\n\n\u2212\n\nX\n\nn\u2208Z\n\nR\u03c9,q (2nL \u2212 x\u2032 \u2212 x) ,\n\nwhere R the diffusion kernel in an infinite domain :\n\u0010 p\n\u0011\nexp \u2212 q 2 + i l\u03c9\u22122 |x \u2212 x\u2032 |\np\nR\u03c9,q (x, x\u2032 ) =\n, (17)\n2\u03ba q 2 + i l\u03c9\u22122\n\u221a\nwith i \u2261 \u22121. Performing the sum (16) and taking the\nderivative with respect to x yields:\nhp\ni\n(qL)2 + i(L/l\u03c9 )2 (1 \u2212 x\u2032 /L)\nsinh\n\u2032\ni\nhp\n.\n\u2202x R>\n\u03c9,q (0, x ) =\n\u03ba sinh\n(qL)2 + i(L/l\u03c9 )2\n\n(18)\nA simpler calculation can be carried out if the source\nis in the negative x region (x\u2032 < 0). In this case the only\nimage source is the symmetric in the x = 0 plane of the\noriginal source, so that the response of the field gradient\non the x = 0\u2212 side of the plate is described by:\n\u221a \u20322\n\u2032\n2\ne\u2212 (qx ) +i(x /l\u03c9 )\n<\n\u2032\n\u2202x R\u03c9,q (0, x ) =\n.\n(19)\n\u03ba\n\nA.\n\nLocalized Periodic Shaking.\n\nIf the only driving is a single monochromatic shaker\nlocated between the plates at x = xs ,\n\u03b7 = \u03b7s ad \u03b4(x \u2212 xs )\u03b4(r) cos(\u03c9s t),\n\n(20)\n\nthen the general expression of the net force acting on the\nx = 0 plate is simply obtained from the definition of the\nresponse function \u2202x R> :\n\u0014Z\n\u0015\n\u2212\u03ba(\u03b7s ad )2\n2\nF (t) =\n\u00d7\n(21)\n\u2202x R>\n(0,\nx\n)\ns\n\u03c9s ,q\n4\nq\n[1 + cos(2 \u03c9s t)] ,\n\n\f6\n4\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n-4\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\nFIG. 7: Log-log plot of the scaling function \u03a5A (xs /L, 0) versus xs /L.

(16,21). If d = 3 \u03a5A (u, 0) =\n\u2202u [\u03c0 (1 \u2212 u) cot (\u03c0u) \u2212 2\u0393u + 2 (1 \u2212 u) \u03c8 (u)] /(32\u03c0), with\n\u03c8 the Euler \u03c8-function, and \u0393 the Euler constant [25],\nif d = 2, \u03a5A (u, 0) = [1 + \u03c0 (1 \u2212 u) cot(\u03c0u)] /(8\u03c0), and\nif d = 1, \u03a5A (u, 0) = (1 \u2212 u)2 /4. The scaling function\n\u03a5A (xs /L, 0) is plotted in Figure 7 (log-log plot). The\nfast decay for values of xs /L larger than 12 witnesses\nthat the elastic distortions are essentially occurring in\nthe L/2 < x < L region. Conversely a shaker close to\nx = 0 induces strong variations of the elastic field in the\nvicinity of the plate, leading to an algebraic divergence\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nFIG. 8: Log-linear plot of the scaling function \u03a5\u0303A . The full\nline corresponds to d = 3, the dashed line to d = 2 and the\ndotted line to d = 1\n\nof the force when xs /L \u2192 0 (if d > 1).\nThe force dependence on the shaker position, can also\nbe qualitatively understood thanks to an electrostatic\nanalogy. In the present quasi-static limit, the kernel R>\n\u03c9s\ncorresponds to the inverse of the Laplace operator (with\nDBC on the plates). Consequently \u03c6 plays the role of\nan electrostatic potential, the plates mimic a grounded\nplanar capacitance, and the shaking source a point like\nparticle bearing a charge \u03b7s ad . The force on the plate is\nthen analogous to the electrostatic force produced by a\npoint like charge [26]. From the image expansion (16)\nwe know that this force is identical to the one produced\non a virtual plane at x = 0 by an infinite number of\n(+\u03b7s ad ) charges located at x = 2nL + xs and of (\u2212\u03b7s ad )\ncharges at x = 2nL \u2212 xs . Hence:\n\u2013If xs < L (c.f Fig. 6): the electric field on the plate\nsurface is dominated by the image charges at |x| = xs , so\n). Higher order reflections produce\nF \u223c \u2212(\u03b7s ad )2 /(\u03baxd\u22121\ns\nimage sources that form dipoles viewed from x = 0.\nTheir subdominant contributions to the electrostatic\nforce actually reduce the above estimation. This implies\nthat the further the second plate, the bigger the force\nproduced by a single shaker.\n\u2013if xs \u223c L (c.f Fig. (6)): the image charges form dipoles\nlocated at x = (2n + 1)L. The electric field on the plate\nis dominated by the influence of the dipole located at\n|x| = L (the closest from the x = 0 plate).

Moreover the amplitude\n\u221a\nof the 2\u03c9s components of the force is 1/ cos[L/(l\u03c9s 2)]\ntimes larger that its mean value FB whatever the shaking\nparameters \u03c9s and \u03b7s .\nShaking-induced organization: The two preceeding\ncomments strongly suggest that the homogenous shaking\nmay be used to dynamically induce spacial \"localization\"\nof the plates. As a matter of fact, when mesoscopic objects are immersed in a soft medium, their intrinsic dynamics (ignored in the present work) necessarily filters\nout high frequency effects of external forcing. If their\nresponse time is much larger than 1/(2\u03c9s ), these \"slow\"\nmoving objects only respond to the stationary component FB of the shaking-induced force. The corresponding steady state interplate distance in the present simple\ngeometry is then controllable by tuning \u03c9s .\n\nC.\n\nColored Noisy Shaking.\n\nThe medium surrounding the plates is now supposed to\nbe driven by stochastic shaking sources with zero mean\nand mean squared fluctuations given by Eq. (13). The\nnoise averaged net force FC experienced by the plate at\nx = 0 is the sum of the mean values of the two independent forces F > and F < . Using Eqs. (12,18,20) this force\n\n\f8\nis written:\nFC =\n\nZ\n2Ld\u22121\nk\nad\n\n\u03c9\n\nS\u03c9\n\n\"Z\n\n0\n\nL\n\n(FA> (x, \u03c9) + FA< (\u2212x, \u03c9)) dx (31)\n+\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nL\n\n\u0015\n\nFA< (\u2212x, \u03c9) dx\n\n.\n\nExact results: For a Lorentzian power spectrum, see\nEq. (14), the integration over frequency and position of\nall the elementary contributions FA (x, \u03c9) in (31) yields:\nFC =\n\n\u03b7s2 ad Ld\u22121\nk\n\n\u0012\n\nL\nl\u03a9s\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n(32)\n\u03a5C\n\u03baLd\u22122\nZ\n1\n\u03a5C (u) =\nq (coth q \u2212 1)\n(33)\n4u2 q\nZp\nh\n\u0010p\n\u0011\ni\n1\n2 + u2 coth\n2 + u2 \u2212 1 .\n\u2212\nq\nq\n4u2 q\n\nThe scaling function \u03a5C is plotted in Fig. 5. To achieve\nthe exact computation of FC , the integral over the inplates q modes in (33) is performed. After some algebra we obtain: If d = 1, \u03a5C = (1 \u2212 u[coth(u) \u2212 1])/u2 ,\nif d = 3, \u03a5C = [3\u03b6(3) \u2212 \u03c0 2 \u2212 6(u2 \u2212 u log(1 \u2212 e2u ) +\n3Li2 (e2u )]/(48\u03c0u2 ), where \u03b6 is the Rieman Zeta\nP\u221e function\nand Li2 the dilogarithm function : Li2 (x) P\n= k=1 xk /k 2 .\nFinally for the d = 2 case \u03a5C = 2 n [K0 (2nu) +\nK2 (2nu)], where Kn is the nth K-Bessel function [25].\nNotice that this last calculation can actually be bypassed, if one already knows the thermal Casimir force\nthe left plate would feel if the soft medium had a finite\ncorrelation lengthR\u03be, precisely if the elastic Hamiltonian\n2 d~\n~ R)]\n~ 2 + [\u03c6(R)/\u03be]\n~\nwere: H = (\u03ba/2) [\u2207\u03c6(\nd R. Denoting\nthis force F\u0303Casimir (L/\u03be), we can show that Eqs. (32,33)\ncan be recast into [27]:\n\u0012 \u0013\u0015\n\u0014\nL\n\u03b7 2 ad \u03a9\u22121\ns\nFC = s\n, (34)\nF\u0303Casimir (0) \u2212 F\u0303Casimir\n2\u03b3kB T\nl\u03a9s\nwhere F\u0303Casimir (0), of course corresponds to the Casimir\nforce the plate experiences in a scale-free fluctuating\nmedium, c.f. Eq. (8).\nQualitative approach: Eq. (31) shows clearly that FC is\nthe result of the incoherent sum over frequencies and positions of the forces produced by localized shakers of the\n\u2013A\u2013 type. Note that the sum over the shaking frequencies is weighted by the noise power spectrum S\u03c9 . This\ndecomposition is now used to justify first the sign of the\nmean force, then the algebraic decays of the mean force\nas observed in Eq.(32) and Fig. (5).\nOnly the elementary monochromatic shakers localized\nat distances |x| < L on the left hand side of the plate\nhave a challenger in the 0 < x < L inner region. Referring to the discussion in Section IV-A, we know that\nFA< > 0 and that |FA> (x, \u03c9)| < |FA< (\u2212x, \u03c9)|. Moreover,\nS\u03c9 is necessarily a positive quantity for all frequencies.\nIt then turns out that the net mean force is positive,\nfor any choice of S\u03c9 : the two objects attract each other.\n\nBesides, FA> (x, \u03c9) \u223c \u2212FA< (\u2212x, \u03c9) for shaker located at\nx < L/2. This important property leads to the cancellation of the short distance divergences in the first term\nof equation (31). Finally, |FA> (x, \u03c9)| \u226a |FA< (\u2212x, \u03c9)| if\n|x| > L/2, so that\nEq.\ncan be approximated by\nR \u221e (31)\nR\nd\u22121 \u2212d\n<\nFC \u223c 2Lk a\n\u03c9 S\u03c9 L/2 FA (\u2212x, \u03c9) dx.\nTo sum up, the elastic field deformations produced by\nthe \u2013A\u2013 type shakers located at x < \u2212L/2 dominate the\nmean net force FC .\nWithout refering to any specific choice for S\u03c9 , the noise\npower spectrum is here characterized only by its width\n\u03a9s , see e.g. Eq. (13). Thus, going to the (x, l\u03c9 ) variables\nand defining L\u2217 \u2261 max(L, l\u03a9s ) we easily deduce:\nFC \u223c\n\nd\u22121 Z\n\u03b7s2 ad \u03a9\u22121\ns Lk\n\n\u03b3\n\n\u221e\n\nL\u2217\n\nd l\u03c9\nl\u03c93\n\nZ\n\nl\u03c9\nL\n\ndx\n,\nxd\u22121\n\n(35)\n\nsince FA< (x, \u03c9) is exponentially weak if x > l\u03c9 and scales\nas 1/xd\u22121 if x < l\u03c9 , c.f. Fig. (9).\nWe can now integrate (35) and distinguish the two\ncases:\n(i) L/l\u03a9s \u226b 1. In this wide noise spectrum limit FC \u223c\n(\u03b7s2 ad \u03a9s\u22121 /\u03b3)Ld\u22121\n/Ld , the thermal Casimir force scaling\nk\nis obtained as anticipated in section III.\n(ii) L/l\u03a9s \u226a 1. In this case the noise correlation time\n\u223c \u03a9s\u22121 is larger than the field relaxation over distances\nsmaller than L. The number of elementary shakers contributing to the force is substantially increased compared\nto (i). Depending on the space dimension d, we obtained\nthe three scaling forms: if d = 3, FC \u223c (\u03b7s2 a3 \u03ba\u22121 )L2k /L, if\nd = 2, FC \u223c (\u03b7s2 a2 \u03ba\u22121 )Lk log(l\u03a9s /L), an finally if d = 1,\nFC \u223c (\u03b7s2 a\u03ba\u22121 )l\u03a9s . In agreement with the above exact\ncalculations and with Fig. 5.\nFluctuations of the shaking-induced force: To conclude\nthis section, we address briefly the question of the fluctuations of the force. In order to asses their relative\nimportance with respect to the mean force value, we\nintroduce the dimensionless ratio: FC /\u2206F , where the\nmean squared deviation \u2206F 2 is defined by: \u2206F 2 \u2261\nhF (t)2 i \u2212 FC2 . Whereas FC is the result of the competition between the mean forces FC> and FC< of opposite\nsigns, the forces' fluctuations on the two sides add up\nand \u2206F 2 = (\u2206F > )2 + (\u2206F < )2 with obvious notations.\nNote that the noise's four points correlation function is a\npriori required to compute \u2206F . We make here one more\n~ t) are Gaussian\nassumption and consider that the \u03b7(R,\nrandom variables with correlations given by Eq. (13,14).\nThis allows to fully characterize the shaking process and\nconsequently the variance of the shaking-induced force.\nFor sake of clarity we present without additional details\nthe scaling form of the mean over variance ratio (ignoring\nlogarithmic corrections):\nFC\n\u223c\n\u2206F\n\n\u0012\n\n\uf8f1 \u0010 \u0011 3\u2212d\n2\n\uf8f4 L\n\u0013 d\u22121\nif L/l\u03a9s \u226a 1\nL k 2 \uf8f2 l\u03a9 s\nd+1\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\uf8f4 l\u03a9 s 2\nL\n\uf8f3\nif L/l\u03a9s \u226b 1\nL\n\n(36)\n\n\f9\nwe have also assumed d > 1, since the 1D case deserve a\nmore careful analysis as in the equilibrium context more\ncarefully studied in [27]. The above expressions shows\nthat, the present shaking induced force can not be a priori reduced to its sole FC value FC . Indeed, depending on\nthe geometrical aspect ratio Lk /L and on the noise correlation time \u03a9\u22121\nthe variance of the force can dominate\ns\nits mean value by orders of magnitude.\nD.\n\nToward more complex dynamics\n\nTo what extent do the results presented above apply to\nsystems evolving according to more complex dynamics?\nIt is noticeable that only the explicit form of the scaling\nfunctions \u03a5X requires a precise description of the field dynamics. Conversely, all the qualitative analysis, as well\nas the asymptotic expressions for the various forces, involve only the definition of the dynamical length l\u03c9 . We\nthus expect that they should be extendable to any other\ndynamic scheme relating algebraically the spatial and the\ntemporal relaxation scale.\nV.\n\nSUMMARY AND OUTLOOK\n\nTo summarize, a simple model has allowed us to show\nthat the concept of fluctuation-induced interactions can\nbe extended to complex fluids driven to out of equilibrium. Our main result concern identical plate-like inclusions immersed in an homogenous medium externally\ndriven by :\u2013A\u2013 a monochromatic localized shaking source\nlocated between the plates, \u2013B\u2013 a monochromatic and\nhomogenous shaking and \u2013C\u2013 a noisy colored shaking.\nThese external processes generate effective forces on the\nplates without acting directly on them. The main features of the mean forces induced by these three simple\nshaking are summarized in the table below and compared\nto their equilibrium thermal Casimir analog.\nShaking Amplitude Range\nA\n\u03b7s2\nl\u03c9s\nB\n\u03b7s2\nl\u03c9s\nC\n\u03b7s2\npower law\nThermal\nkB T\npower law\n\nSign\nrepulsion\ntunable\nattraction\nattraction\n\ngenerate effective forces that decays algebraically\nwith the interplate distance.\n(ii) If the external shaking occurs only between the two\nplates the resulting interaction is always repulsive.\nConversely, when distributed on the whole sample\nthe external shakers generate forces on both sides\nof the plates. The resulting net force is attractive\nfor spatially uncorrelated shaking. On the contrary,\nwith coherent shaking, interference phenomena between the elastic medium distortions can lead to\nattractive or repulsive interactions.\n(iii) The soft medium-plates coupling has been here\nmodeled by Dirichlet boundary conditions. As in\nthe equilibrium case our results are expected to\nhold for other static boundary conditions representing strong interactions. In contrast the description\nof situations of weaker coupling and/or cases where\ndynamic boundary conditions are required could\nyield to new phenomenology.\n(iv) The generalization of our results to an elastic\nmedium characterized by an intrinsic relaxation\nscale \u03be (see the discussion above Eq. (34)) can\nbe done without much effort following blindly the\nprocedures described in this paper. The only qualitative difference in the results summarized in the\nabove table is the forces' range: For shakings of the\n\u2013A\u2013 and \u2013B\u2013 type the range of the force becomes:\nmin(\u03be, l\u03c9 ). In the noisy shaking case \u2013C\u2013 the force\ndecay is not algebraic anymore but exponential for\ninterplate distances larger than \u03be.\n(v) Beyond the derivation of their average values, we\nhave also shown that the shaking-induced forces\nare in general expected to be strongly fluctuating\nquantities, whatever their precise origin.\n\n(i) Whereas a shaking at a single frequency leads necessarily to short range interactions, noisy shakings\n\nTo conclude, let us recall that our description is clearly\nextremely simplified and of course is not supposed to\nmodel any real system. Even within this simple framework the extension of our result to many moving objects\nremains complex. But, the analysis of simplified situations such as the one described here could certainly help\nunderstanding ordering and dynamic behavior of inclusions in out-of equilibrium complex fluids.\n\n[1] D.
