FEYEL AND A. S. \u00dcST\u00dcNEL\n\nAbstract. We study the log-concave measures, their characterization via the Pr\u00e9kopa-Leindler\nproperty and also define a subset of it whose elements are called super log-concave measures which\nhave the property of satisfying a logarithmic Sobolev inequality. We give some results about their\nstability. Certain relations with measure transportation are also indicated.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe importance of logarithmically concave functions and measures has been discovered in the 70's\n(cf. [10, 11, 9, 2]) and they have found applications immediately in physics (cf. [13]). This notion has\ngained further importance when its close relations to Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation and more generally\nto measure transportation has been realized (cf.[16] and the references there). In this work we give a\ngeneral treatment of the subject beginning from the finite dimensional case and going towards to the\ninfinite dimensions. A preliminary definition of log-concave measures is given using the Lebesgue\nmeasure then we extend this definition to the measures without density by using the Pr\u00e9kopaLeindler property which characterizes them, which is also equivalent to Brunn-Minkowski property.\nWe also introduce the notion of super log-concave measures, namely these are the measures which\ndecrease very rapidly at infinity, in fact faster than some Gaussian measure and they always satisfy\nthe logarithmic Sobolev inequality. Their definition uses the Euclidean structure of the underlying\nspace on which they are defined, consequently, we need a special structure if we want to extend this\nnotion to the infinite dimensional case. This is done by adjoining a rigged Hilbert space structure\nto the Fr\u00e9chet space supporting the measure under question, whose typical example is an abstract\nWiener space with its Cameron-Martin space. Afterwards we concentrate ourselves to the case of\nWiener space, first we give some complementary results about the Jacobians corresponding to the\nimage of the Wiener measure under a general perturbation of identity with lacking regularity and\nshow that although each term of the Jacobian is not properly defined, their multiplication may create\na renormalization, which is the typical case with monotone shifts. Even in this case, the log-concave\ncharacter of the Jacobian is preserved and we use this observation to give another proof of the\nPr\u00e9kopa-Leindler property for the Gaussian measure with \"less log-concave\" functions (called 1-log\nconcave) and we give also another proof of this property using the reverse martingale convergence\ntheorem, in particular we prove that the property of the functions used to test Pr\u00e9kopa-Leindler\nproperty is preserved under the conditional expectations and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup.\n2. Preliminaries and notations\nGenerally each section contains its notational conventions with the exception of the Gaussian case;\nin fact we denote by (W, H, \u03bc) an abstract Wiener space, namely, W is a separable Fr\u00e9chet space,\nH \u2282 W is a separable Hilbert space densely injected into W , \u03bc is the unit Gauss measure supported\nby W which is quasi-invariant under the translation by the elements of H. One defines the usual\nGateaux derivative of the nice functions on W along the subspace H, due to the quasi-invariance,\nthis derivative has a unique (closed) extension to all the Lp (\u03bc)-spaces with p \u2265 1 and it is denoted\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Hence, for a nice function f on W , \u2207f\ndefines a linear functional on H \u03bc-almost surely, consequently it can be identified with an element of\nH \u22c6 = H. Since the Sobolev derivative maps the scalar functions to H-valued functions, its adjoint,\ncalled the divergence operator, maps the vector valued functions to scalar ones and denoted by \u03b4,\nin particular, we have\nZ\nZ\n(\u03be, \u2207f )H d\u03bc =\nf \u03b4\u03bed\u03bc ,\nW\n\nW\n\nfor \u03be : W \u2192 H cylindrical, well-known as the integration by parts formula. The very remarkable\nproperty of the divergence is that in the case of classical Wiener space W = C([0, 1], IRn ), if \u03be has\nan adapted Lebesgue density \u03be \u2032 (t, w), then it holds that\nZ 1\n\u03b4\u03be(w) =\n\u03be \u2032 (t, w)dWt (w) ,\n0\n\nwhere the integral with dW denotes the It\u00f4 stochastic integral.\n3. Log-concave and super log-concave measures in finite dimension\nWe begin by an initial concept:\nDefinition 1. A (positive) measure \u03c1 on IRd is said to satisfy the Pr\u00e9kopa-Leindler property if for\nany positive, continuous functions of compact support, say a, b, c such that\na(sx + ty) \u2265 b(x)s c(y)t\n\n(3.1)\nfor any x, y \u2208 IRd , s + t = 1, one has\n(3.2)\n\n\u03c1(a) \u2265 \u03c1(b)s \u03c1(c)t .\n\nTheorem 1. Assume that \u03b8 is a log-concave function, denote by \u03c1 the measure d\u03c1(x) = \u03b8(x)dx.\nThen \u03c1 satisfies the Pr\u00e9kopa-Leindler property.\nHere are two other well-known results which are due to Pr\u00e9kopa, [10], that we derive using the above\nconsiderations:\nCorollary 1. Let f and g be two integrable, log-concave functions, then their convolution f \u22c6 g is\nlog-concave. Moreover, for any c \u2208 IR, the function f \u22c6c g which is defined as\nZ\nf \u22c6c g(x) = f (cx \u2212 y)g(y)dy\n\nis again a log-concave function.\n\nProof: Let fx (u) = f (x \u2212 u), then (fsx+ty g)(su + tv) \u2265 (fx (u)g(u))s (fy (v)g(v))t , hence we can\napply the theorem and obtain the inequality which characterizes the log-concavity. The proof of the\nsecond part is similar.\nCorollary 2. Let f (x, \u03be) be a log-concave function on IRd \u00d7 IRm , define F (x) as to be\nZ\nf (x, \u03be)d\u03be .\nF (x) =\nIRm\n\nThen F is log-concave on IRd .\nProof: Let fx (\u03be) denote f (x, \u03be), then for s + t = 1, x, y \u2208 IRd , \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 IRm , we have\nfsx+ty (s\u03be + t\u03b7) \u2265 fx (\u03be)s fy (\u03b7)t ,\n\n\fLOG-CONCAVE MEASURES\n\n3\n\nhence\nF (sx + ty) =\n\nZ\n\nfsx+ty (\u03be)d\u03be \u2265\n\n= F (x)s F (y)t .\n\n\u0012Z\n\nfx (\u03be)d\u03be\n\n\u0013s \u0012Z\n\nfy (\u03be)d\u03be\n\n\u0013t\n\nThe results above indicate that the following definition is reasonable\nDefinition 2. A (positive) measure on IRd is called log-concave if any of its convolutions with\nlog-concave continuous functions of compact support has a log-concave density.\nRemark: Let us note that, for a measure \u03c1 to be log-concave, it suffices the existence of just one\ncontinuous, log-concave function \u03b8 such that \u03b8\u03b5 \u22c6 \u03c1 has a log-concave density for any \u03b5 > 0 where\n\u03b8\u03b5 denotes the d-dimensional rescaling of \u03b8. In fact using the commutativity of convolutions, we\nobtain also that \u03b8\u0303 \u22c6 \u03c1 has again a log-concave density, for any other continuous log-concave function\nof compact support \u03b8\u0303.\nProposition 1. Let \u03c11 and \u03c12 be two log-concave measures on IRn and IRm respectively. Then the\nproduct measure \u03c11 \u2297 \u03c12 is log-concave on IRn \u00d7 IRm .\nProof: From Definition 2, it suffices to assume that d\u03c11 (x) = e\u2212V1 (x) dx and d\u03c12 (y) = e\u2212V2 (y) dy,\nwhere Vi , i = 1, 2 are convex functions. Then (x, y) \u2192 V1 (x) + V2 (y) is convex on IRn \u00d7 IRm .\nProposition 2. Let (\u03c1n , n \u2265 1) be a sequence of log-concave measures converging weakly to \u03c1, then\n\u03c1 is also log-concave.\nProof: Let \u03b8 be a log-concave function as described above, then the density of \u03b8 \u22c6 \u03c1 is the limit of\nthe densities of (\u03b8 \u22c6 \u03c1n ).\nThe following theorem is the first pavement to extend the definition of log-concavity to the infinite\ndimensional case where the Lebesgue measure does not exist:\nTheorem 2. \u03c1 is a log-concave measure if and only if it satisfies the Pr\u00e9kopa-Leindler property.\nProof: Suppose that \u03c1 has a continuous density F with respect to the Lebesgue measure of IRd . Let\nf = 1A , g = 1B , where A and B are two balls whose centers are located at a and b respectively and\nwhose diameter will tend to zero. Let C = 12 (A + B) and h = 1C then h(\u03b1x + \u03b2y) \u2265 f (x)\u03b1 g(y)\u03b2\nfor any \u03b1 + \u03b2 = 1, x, y \u2208 IRd . Hence for \u03b1 = 12 , by taking the limit, we obtain\n1\n1\n1\nF ( (a + b)) \u2265 F (a) 2 F (b) 2 ,\n2\nwhich is a sufficient condition for the log-concavity of F . The general case follows by taking the\nconvolution of \u03c1. The necessity follows from the transport argument that we have used in the proof\nof Theorem 1.\n\nCorollary 3. If a measure satisfies the relation (3.2) for the continuous functions satisfying the\ncondition (3.1), then it also satisfies the same relation for Borel functions satisfying (3.1).\nProof: If the relation (3.2) is satisfied by \u03c1, then it is also satisfied by \u03c1 \u22c6 \u03b8 where \u03b8 is a log-concave\nfunction, since \u03c1(\u03b8 \u22c6 a) = (\u03c1 \u22c6 \u03b8)(a).\nCorollary 4. Let \u03c1 be a log-concave measure and let F be a convex function, then the measure \u03bd\ndefined as\nd\u03bd(x) = e\u2212F (x) d\u03c1(x)\nis again log-concave.\n\n\f4\n\nD. FEYEL AND A. S. \u00dcST\u00dcNEL\n\nProof: The new measure obviously satisfies the Pr\u00e9kopa-Leindler property.\nA very close characterization of the log-concave measures can be given by the Brunn-Minkowski\ninequality whose proof is similar to that of Theorem 2\nTheorem 3. The measure \u03c1 is log-concave if and only if\n\u03c1(sA + tB) \u2265 \u03c1(A)s \u03c1(B)t\nfor any measurable A, B and s + t = 1.\nDefinition 3. A (positive) measure \u03c1 on IRn is called \u03b1-super log-concave (\u03b1-s.l.c in short) if the\nmeasure\n2\n\u03b1\ne 2 |x| \u03c1(dx)\nis a log-concave measure, where \u03b1 \u2265 0 and | * | denotes the Euclidean norm.\nRemark 1. Since exp \u2212 \u03b12 |x|2 is a log-concave function, any \u03b1-s.l.c. measure is log-concave.\nProposition 3. Assume that a measure \u03c1 can be represented as\nd\u03c1(x) = e\u2212V (x) dx\nwhere V is a locally integrable, lower bounded function such that\n\u22072 V \u2265 \u03b1IIRn\nin the sense of distributions, then \u03c1 is \u03b1-s.l.c. '\nProof: Evidently the condition implies the convexity of the function x \u2192 V (x) \u2212 \u03b12 |x|2 .\nRemark 2. If \u03c1i are finitely many \u03b1i -s.l.c. measures on IRni , then their product is an mini \u03b1i -s.l.c.\nmeasure.\nThe proof of the following lemma follows from that of Theorem 2:\nLemma 1. A measure \u03c1 is an \u03b1-s.l.c. if and only if for any a, b, c continuous, positive functions of\ncompact support such that, for any x, y \u2208 IRn , s + t = 1, a(sx + ty) \u2265 b(x)s c(y)t , one has\n\u03c1(a\u03b1 ) \u2265 \u03c1(b\u03b1 )s \u03c1(c\u03b1 )t ,\nwhere, for a given function f , f\u03b1 is defined as\n\u03b1\nf\u03b1 (x) = exp( |x|2 )f (x) .\n2\nThe proof of the following is obvious:\nLemma 2. Suppose that (\u03c1n , n \u2265 1) is a sequence of measures converging weakly to \u03c1.

Infinite dimensional case\nThe following is basic:\nTheorem 5. Let E be a separable Fr\u00e9chet space and let \u03c1 be a probability on (E, E), where E denotes\nthe Borel sigma algebra of E. Assume that the finite dimensional projections of \u03c1 are log-concave.\nAssume that f, g, h are positive Borel functions satisfying\nh(su + tv) \u2265 f (u)s g(v)t\nfor any u, v \u2208 E and s + t = 1. Then \u03c1 satisfies the Pr\u00e9kopa-Leindler property:\n\u03c1(h) \u2265 \u03c1(f )s \u03c1(g)t .\nProof: We can suppose that \u03c1 has convex, compact support K Q\nand replace E by IRIN by injection.\n\u221e\nThen we can replace K by a product of compact intervals J = 1 Jn . If f and g are continuous,\ncylindrical functions on J, for x \u2208 J, define\n\u0001\nk(x) = sup f (u)s g(v)t : x = su + tv, u, v \u2208 J .\n\nThe function k is then continuous on J and we have, from the finite dimensional case,\n\u03c1(k) \u2265 \u03c1(f )s \u03c1(g)t .\n\nIf f and g are upper semi-continuous on J, there exist two sequences of continuous and cylindrical\nfunctions (fn ) and (gn ), decreasing to f and g respectively. Hence, (kn , n \u2265 1), where kn is defined\nas above, converges to k as defined above and we again have\n\u03c1(k) \u2265 \u03c1(f )s \u03c1(g)t .\nFinally, if f and g are only Borel measurable, there exist two monotone, increasing sequences\n(fn ), (gn ) whose elements are upper semi-continuous such that limn \u03c1(fn ) = \u03c1(f ) and limn \u03c1(gn ) =\n\u03c1(g). Since we have h \u2265 kn , it follows that\n\u03c1(h) \u2265\n\nsup \u03c1(kn ) \u2265 sup \u03c1(fn )s \u03c1(gn )t\nn\n\n=\n\nn\n\n\u03c1(f )s \u03c1(g)t .\n\nThe proof of the above theorem contains also the proof of the following\nLemma 5. In order the Pr\u00e9kopa-Leindler to hold it is necessary and sufficient that it holds only for\nthe continuous functions f, g, h such that h(sx + ty) \u2265 f (x)s g(y)t for any x, y \u2208 E and s + t = 1.\nThe proof of the following theorem is quite similar to the proof of Theorem 5:\nTheorem 6. Assume that E and F are two separable Fr\u00e9chet spaces with \u03c1 and \u03bd satisfying the\nPr\u00e9kopa-Leindler property on E and F respectively. Then the product measure \u03c1 \u2297 \u03bd satisfies also\nthe Pr\u00e9kopa-Leindler property on E \u00d7 F .\n\n\fLOG-CONCAVE MEASURES\n\n7\n\nThe following definition is now justified:\nDefinition 4. A Radon measure on a locally convex space E is called log-concave if it satisfies the\nPr\u00e9kopa-Leindler property.\nThe following result is immediate:\nProposition 4. The image of a log-concave measure under any linear, continuous map is again\nlog-concave.\nFrom Lemma 5 we get at once\nCorollary 5. Let (\u03c1n , n \u2265 1) be a sequence of log-concave measures converging weakly to a measure\n\u03c1, then \u03c1 is also log-concave.\nCorollary 6. Let \u03c1 be a bounded measure on IRIN , let us denote by (\u03c0n , n \u2265 1) the canonical finite\ndimensional projections. The measures (\u03c0n (\u03c1), n \u2265 1) are log-concave if and only if \u03c1 is log-concave.\nProof: We can write \u03c1 as the weak limit of the sequence of measures (\u03c0n (\u03c1) \u2297 \u03b4 n , n \u2265 1) where \u03b4 n\nis the image under I \u2212 \u03c0n of the Dirac \u03b40 measure on IRIN .\nAssume now that E is a separable Fr\u00e9chet space and assume that H is a separable Hilbert space\ncontinuously and densely injected into E. We identify H with its continuous dual, hence E \u22c6 \u2282 H \u2282\nE. Choose a sequence (\u1ebdi , i \u2265 1) from E \u22c6 such that its image under the injection E \u22c6 \u0592\u2192 H, denoted\nas (ei , i \u2265 1) is a complete, orthonormal base of H. Define \u03c0n on E as\nX\n\u03c0n (x) =\nhx, \u1ebdi iei .\ni\u2264n\n\nThe typical examples for this situation is the case of the Wiener space for E and the Cameron-Martin\nspace for H or E = IRIN , H = l2 .\nDefinition 5. A Radon measure \u03c1 on E is called \u03b1-s.l.c.\n(1) if limn \u03c0n (x) = x \u03c1-almost everywhere,\n(2) if \u03c0n (\u03c1) is \u03b1-s.l.c. on the Euclidean space spanned by {e1 , . . . , en }, for any n \u2265 1.\nWe have the following result which is the immediate consequence of the finite dimensional case (cf.\nTheorem 4):\nTheorem 7. If \u03c1 is an \u03b1-s.l.c. measure on E, then it satisfies the logarithmic Sobolev inequality:\n\u03c1(f 2 log f 2 ) \u2264\n\n2\n\u03c1(|\u2207f |2H )\n\u03b1\n\nfor any smooth, cylindrical function f with \u03c1(f 2 ) = 1.\n5. The case of abstract Wiener space\nWhile working in this frame one encounters often the difficulty of defining a proper Jacobian due\nto the lack of regularity of the corresponding transformation. This happens especially in the case\nof the measure transportation theory. Consequently it is reasonable to push the ways to extend as\nmuch as possible the notion of Jacobian of a transformation with unsufficient regularity.\n5.1. Sub-jacobians for monotone transformations. Let (W, H, \u03bc) be an abstract Wiener space,\nwe say that a map U = IW + u, where u : W \u2192 H is a measurable map is monotone or a monotone\nshift, if h \u2192 (h + u(w + h), h)H \u2265 0 \u03bc-almost surely.\n\n\f8\n\nD.

The necessary background about the subject and the proof follows from [15], Theorem 6.3.1.\nRemark: If A is a nuclear operator on a Hilbert space, then det2 (IH + A) is defined as\ndet2 (IH + A) = det(IH + A) exp \u2212 trace (A) ,\nand this function has an analytic extension to the space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators, consequently,\nthe log-concavity of the ordinary determinant implies the log-concavity of the map A \u2192 det2 (IH +A).\nLemma 7. Assume that U = IW + u is a monotone shift and u \u2208 IDp,0 (H) = Lp (\u03bc, H) for some\np > 1. Then there exists some \u03bb(u) \u2265 0 a.s., E[\u03bb(u)] \u2264 1 and\nE[f \u25e6 U \u03bb(u)] \u2264 E[f ]\nfor any positive and measurable f . In particular, U \u03bc is absolutely continuous w.r.to \u03bc on the set on\nwhich \u03bb(u) > 0.\nProof. Let (Pt , t \u2265 0) be the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup, let Un = IW + un , with un = P1/n u.\nThen apply Lemma 6 to Un . Define\n\u03bb(U ) = lim inf \u039b(Un ) .\nn\n\n\u03bb(U ) does exist and, from the Fatou lemma, it is integrable and satisfies the claim.\nCorollary 7. The map U \u2192 \u03bb(U ) is almost surely log-concave on the set of monotone shifts.\nProof. If Ui = IW + ui , with ui \u2208 Lp (\u03bc, H), i = 1, 2 are two monotone shifts, define uni = P1/n ui ,\nUin = IW + uni , i = 1, 2. Then, by the log-concavity of the Carleman-Fredholm determinant, for\ns, t \u2208 [0, 1] with s + t = 1, we have\n\u039b(sU1n + tU2n ) \u2265 \u039b(U1n )s \u039b(U2n )t\na.s. If we take the lim inf of both sides as n \u2192 \u221e, the inequality is preserved.\nProposition 5. Assume that Un = IW + un , n \u2265 1, is a sequence of shifts, where un \u2208 IDp,1 (H),\nfor some p > 1.

Then Ln \u25e6 Un \u2192 L \u25e6 U , \u039b(Un ) \u2192 \u03bb(U ) in L0 (\u03bc) and we have\nL \u25e6 U \u03bb(U ) = 1\na.s. Besides, under the additional hypothesis:\nsup E[log+ Ln ] < \u221e ,\nn\n\nthe sequence (\u039b(Un ), n \u2265 1) is uniformly integrable, hence it converges to \u03bb(U ) also in L1 (\u03bc) and\nwe have\nE[f \u25e6 U \u03bb(U )] = E[f ] ,\nfor any f \u2208 Cb (W ).\n\n\fLOG-CONCAVE MEASURES\n\n9\n\nProof. Since Ln \u2192 L in L1 (\u03bc) and Un \u2192 U in probability, it follows from the Lusin theorem that\nLn \u25e6 Un \u2192 L \u25e6 U in probability, hence (\u039b(Un ), n \u2265 1) converges in probability and hence\nlim \u039b(Un ) = lim inf \u039b(Un ) = \u03bb(U ) .\nn\n\nThe rest is obvious, since the last hypothesis implies precisely the uniform integrability of the\nsequence (\u039b(Un ), n \u2265 1).\nRemark 3. Proposition 5 is astonishing in the sense that we do not make any assumption about\nthe convergence of the H-valued parts of the shifts at all.

FEYEL AND A. S. \u00dcST\u00dcNEL\n\nCorollary 9. Assume B, C are two measurable subsets of W , then, for any measure \u03bd as in Theorem\n8, we have\n\u03bd(sB + tC) \u2265 \u03bd(B)s \u03bd(C)t ,\nwhere s + t = 1, s, t \u2265 0.\nProof: Let a, b and c be the indicator functions of the sets sB + tC, B and C respectively.\nBefore further infinite dimensional considerations let us give a lemma which is a version of Theorem\n2.1 of [2]\nLemma 8. Assume that f, f0 , f1 are positive, bounded, measurable functions on IRn such that for\nany Borel sets C0 , C1 , some \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 [0, 1] with \u03b1 + \u03b2 = 1, we have\n\u0012Z\n\u0013\u03b1 \u0012Z\n\u0013\u03b2\nZ\nf (x)dx \u2265\n(5.3)\nf0 (x)dx\nf1 (x)dx\n,\nC\n\nC0\n\nC1\n\nwhere C = \u03b1C0 + \u03b2C1 . Then, for any x0 , x1 \u2208 IRn , we have\n\nf (z + \u03b1x0 + \u03b2x1 ) \u2265 f0 (z + x0 )\u03b1 f1 (z + x1 )\u03b2\ndz-almost surely. In particular, if the above identity holds whenever we replace the Lebesgue integral\nwith the Gaussian integral, then f, f0 and f1 satisfy the following identity\n1\nf (z + \u03b1x0 + \u03b2x1 ) exp |\u03b1x0 + \u03b2x1 |2\n2\n\u0013\u03b1 \u0012\n\u0013\u03b2\n\u0012\n1\n1\nf1 (z + x1 ) exp \u2212 |x1 |2\n\u2265 f0 (z + x0 ) exp \u2212 |x0 |2\n2\n2\ndz-almost surely.\nProof: We may suppose that the functions are of bounded support. Let C0 = z + x0 + \u03b5In ,\nC1 = z + x1 + \u03b5In , where In = [\u22121/2, 1/2]n. Then the l.h.s. of the inequality (5.3) can be written as\nZ\n1\n1\u03b5In (x \u2212 (z + \u03b1x0 + \u03b2x1 ))f (x)dx\n\u03b5n\nwhich converges in measure to f (z + \u03b1x0 + \u03b2x1 ) as \u03b5 \u2192 0. For the terms at the r.h.s. we have similar\nconvergence results in measure. For the Gaussian case, it suffice to replace the functions f, f0 , f1\nwith f q, f0 q and f1 q respectively, where q denotes the Gaussian density.\nLet (en , n \u2265 1) \u2282 W \u2217 be a CONB basis of H and denote by Vn the sigma algebra generated by\n{\u03b4e1 , . . . , \u03b4en } and completed with \u03bc-negligeable sets. We have\nTheorem 9. Assume that a, b and c are measurable, positive functions on W . For given s, t \u2208 [0, 1]\nwith s + t = 1 and for any h, k \u2208 H, we have\n(1) For any h, k \u2208 H, the following inequality holds \u03bc-a.s.\n\u0012\n\u0013s\n1\n1\na(w + sh + tk) exp \u2212 |sh + tk|2H \u2265 b(w + h) exp \u2212 |h|2H\n2\n2\n\u0013t\n\u0012\n1\n(5.4)\nc(w + k) exp \u2212 |k|2H\n2\nif and only if\n1\nE[a|Vn ](w + s\u03c0n h + t\u03c0n k) exp \u2212 |s\u03c0n h + t\u03c0n k|2H\n2\n\u0013s\n\u0012\n1\n2\n\u2265 E[b|Vn ](w + \u03c0n h) exp \u2212 |\u03c0n h|H\n2\n\u0013t\n\u0012\n1\n* E[c|Vn ](w + \u03c0n k) exp \u2212 |\u03c0n k|2H\n2\n\n\fLOG-CONCAVE MEASURES\n\n13\n\n\u03bc-a.s., where \u03c0n denotes the orthogonal projection of H onto the space spanned by {e1 , . . . , en }.\n(2) Similarly, the relation (1) is equivalent to\n\u0012\n\u0013s\n1 2\n1\n2\nP\u03c4 b(w + h) exp \u2212 |h|H\nP\u03c4 a(w + sh + tk) exp \u2212 |sh + tk|H \u2265\n2\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013t\n1\nP\u03c4 c(w + k) exp \u2212 |k|2H\n2\nfor any \u03c4 \u2265 0, where P\u03c4 denotes the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup.\nProof: We can suppose that a, b, c are bounded. Denote by an , bn , cn the conditional expectations\nof a, b, c respectively w.r.to Vn . Let now B and C be Vn -measurable sets, hence sB + tC is also\nVn -measurable (recall that Vn is completed!). It then follows from Theorem 8\nZ\nZ\na d\u03bc\nan d\u03bc =\nsB+tC\n\nsB+tC\n\n\u2265\n\n\u0012Z\n\nb d\u03bc\n\nB\n\n=\n\n\u0012Z\n\n\u0013s \u0012Z\n\nc d\u03bc\n\nC\n\nbn d\u03bc\n\nB\n\n\u0013s \u0012Z\n\n\u0013t\n\ncn d\u03bc\n\nC\n\n\u0013t\n\n.\n\nSince this true for any Vn -measurable set, it follows from Lemma 8 that an , bn and cn satisfy the\ninequality claimed in the first part of the theorem (with the Gaussian measure). To prove the second\npart, we can replace a, b, c by an , bn , cn since P\u03c4 commutes with the conditional expectation w.r.to\nVn . Hence the problem is reduced to the finite dimensional case. Let us denote again by the same\nnotation the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup on IRn . Then we can write\nZ\nZ\nZ\nan (y)q\u03c4 (x, y)dyd\u03bc(x) ,\nP\u03c4 an (x)d\u03bc(x) =\nsB+tC\n\nsB+tC\n\nIRn\n\nwhere\nq\u03c4 (x, y) = (2\u03c0(1 \u2212 e\u22122\u03c4 ))\u2212n/2 exp \u2212\n\n|y \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 x|2\n,\n2(1 \u2212 e\u22122\u03c4 )\n\nwhich is a log-concave function in two variables. We can also write\n(sB + tC) \u00d7 IRn = s(B \u00d7 IRn ) + t(C \u00d7 IRn ) .\nIt then follows from the Pr\u00e9kopa-Leindler inequality in IRn \u00d7 IRn that\n\u0012Z\n\u0013s \u0012Z\n\u0013t\nZ\nP\u03c4 an d\u03bc \u2265\nP\u03c4 bn d\u03bc\nP\u03c4 cn d\u03bc .\nsB+tC\n\nB\n\nC\n\nIt follows then from Lemma 8 that we have\n1\nP\u03c4 an (w + sh + tk) exp \u2212 |s\u03c0n h + t\u03c0n k|2H\n2\n\n\u2265\n\n\u0012\n\u0013s\n1\nP\u03c4 bn (w + h) exp \u2212 |\u03c0n h|2H\n2\n\u0013t\n\u0012\n1\n2\nP\u03c4 cn (w + k) exp \u2212 |\u03c0n k|H\n2\n\nalmost surely and we can pass to the limit as n \u2192 \u221e due to the martingale convergence theorem.\n\n\f14\n\nD.
