Outflows\nfrom Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are much more common than previously thought: the overal fraction of AGNs\nwith outflows is fairly constant, approximately 60%, over\nmany order of magnitude in luminosity (Ganguly & Brotherton 2008). These mass-loss mechanisms are also observed\nin microquasars, Young Stellar Object (YSO) and even from\nbrown dwarfs (Ferrari 1998; Bally, Reipurth & Davis 2007;\nWhelan et al 2005). About 30% of T Tauri stars present\nbipolar ejection and this percentage increases to 100% for\nclass 0 objects, the earliest stage of star formation. It is now\nwidely accepted that winds or outflows have their origin in\naccretion flows (e.g., Blandford & Payne 1982). They may\nprovide an additional important sink of mass, angular momentum and energy which their dynamical influence to the\naccretion flow can not be neglected. However, it remains\nunclear as how some part of the accreting gas can be transferred into winds or outflows.\nNevertheless, deviations from Keplerian rotation in\nsome AGNs and the flat infrared spectrum of some T Tauri\nstars can both be described by self-gravitating discs. Ver-\n\n\u22c6 E-mail: mohsen.shadmehri@dcu.ie (MS);\nc 0000 RAS\n\ntical structure of an accretion disc under the influence of\nself-gravity was studied by Paczy\u0144ski (1978). Some authors\nstudied the effects related to self-gravity of the disc in the\nradial direction (e.g., Bodo & Curir 1992). New class of selfgravitating discs has also been proposed, in which the energy\nequation is replaced by a self-regulation condition (Bertin &\nLodato 1999; Lodato & Bertin 2001). Mineshige & Umemura\n(1997) extended the previous steady state solutions to the\ntime-dependent case while the effect of the self-gravity of the\ndisc was taken into account. They used an isothermal equation of state, and so their solutions describe a viscous accretion disc in the slow accretion limit. Also, Tsuribe (1999)\nstudied the self-similar collapse of an isothermal viscous accretion disc.\nFor simplicity, outflow is neglected in most of the\nsteady-state or time-dependent theoretical models of the\nself-gravitating discs. However, some authors studied the\neffect of wind or outflow on the radial structure of nonself-gravitating accretion discs (e.g., Knigge 1999). Recently,\nCombet & Ferreira (2008) studied the structure of YSO accretion discs in an approach that takes into account the presence of the protostellar jets. They showed that discs with jet\npresents structure different from the standard accretion disc\nbecause of the influences of jets on the radial structure of\nthe disc. Ruden (2004) studied the physics of protoplanetary\ndisc evolution in the presence of a photoevaporative wind.\nIn this paper, we generalize time-dependent solutions\n\n\f2\n\nM. Shadmehri\n\nof Mineshige & Umemura (1997) for a self-gravitating accretion disc to include winds or outflows. Our parametric model describes mass and angular momentum loss by\nwind in an isothermal, self-gravitating disc, yet applicable\nto many types of dynamical disc-wind models. Basic equations are presented in the next section. Properties of our\nsemi-analytical are discussed in section 3. A summary of\nimplications of the results are given in section 4.\n\n2\n\nGENERAL FORMULATION\n\nWe consider an accretion disc that is axisymmetric and geometrically thin, i.e. H/R < 1. Here R and H are, respectively, the disk radius and the half-thickness. The disc is\nsupposed to be turbulent and possesses an effective turbulent viscosity. In our model, a central object has not yet been\nformed and the radial component of the gravitational force\nis provided by the self-gravity of the disc. The continuity\nequations reads\n\u2202\u03a3\n1 \u2202\n1 \u2202 \u1e40w\n+\n(r\u03a3vr ) +\n= 0,\n\u2202t\nr \u2202r\n2\u03c0r \u2202r\n\n(1)\n\nwhere vr is the accretion velocity (vr < 0) and \u03a3 = 2\u03c1H\nis the surface density at a cylindrical radius r. Also, \u03c1 is\nthe midplane density of the disc and the mass loss rate by\noutflow/wind is represented by \u1e40w . So,\n\u1e40w (R) =\n\nZ\n\n4\u03c0R\u2032 \u1e41w (R\u2032 )dR\u2032 ,\n\n(2)\n\n\u03c1vz+\n\nwhere \u1e41w (R) =\nis mass loss rate per unit area from\neach disc face. Here, vz+ is a mean vertical velocity at the\ndisc surface, i.e., at the base of a wind.\nThe radial momentum equation is\n2\nv\u03c6\n\u2202vr\nc2 \u2202\u03a3\nGMr\n\u2202vr\n+ vr\n=\u2212 s\n\u2212 2 +\n,\n(3)\n\u2202t\n\u2202r\n\u03a3 \u2202r\nr\nr\nwhere v\u03c6 is the rotational velocity. As in Mineshige &\nUmemura (1997), we adopt the monopole approximation for\nthe radial gravitational force due to the self-gravity of the\ndisc, which considerably simplify the calculations and are\nnot expected to introduce any significant errors as long as\nthe surface density profile is steeper than 1/r (e.g., Li & Shu\n1997; Saigo & Hanawa 1998; Tsuribe 1999; Krasnopolsky &\nK\u00f6nigl 2002). Also, we assume that the disc is vertically selfgravitating and so, the half thickness of the disc, H, becomes\nH = c2s /(2\u03c0G\u03a3).\nSimilarly, integration over z of the azimuthal equation\nof motion gives (e.g., Knigge 1999)\n\n1 \u2202 3\n\u2202\u03a9\n\u2202\n\u2202\n(rv\u03c6 ) + vr (rv\u03c6 ) =\n(r \u03bd\u03a3\n)\n\u2202t\n\u2202r\nr\u03a3 \u2202r\n\u2202r\n(lr)2 \u03a9 \u2202 \u1e40w\n\u2212\n,\n(4)\n2\u03c0r\u03a3 \u2202r\nwhere the last term of right hand side represents angular\nmomentum carried by the outflowing material. Here, l = 0\ncorresponds to a non-rotating wind and l = 1 to outflowing\nmaterial that carries away the specific angular momentum\nit had at the point of ejection and it should be most appropriate for radiation-driven outflows (Knigge 1999). Centrifugally driven MHD winds are corresponding to l > 1 as\n\nhas been discussed in Knigge (1999). In this case, we have\nl = RA /R where RA is Alfven radius (e.g., Knigge 1999).\nAlso, \u03bd is a kinematic viscosity coefficient and we assume\n\u03bd = \u03b1cs H = \u03b1(H/r)cs r, where cs is the sound speed. As in\nMineshige & Umemura (1997), we assume \u03b1\u2032 = \u03b1(H/r) is\nconstant in space. Thus, in our model the viscosity coefficient is in proportion to the radius which has also been used\nby some other authors (e.g., Hartmann et al 1998).\nWe introduce similarity variable x \u2261 r/(cs t) and the\nphysical quantities as\ncs\n\u03c3(x),\n(5)\n\u03a3(r, t) =\n2\u03c0Gt\nvr (r, t) = cs u(x),\n\n(6)\n\nv\u03c6 (r, t) = cs v(x),\n\n(7)\n\nj = xv(x),\n\n(8)\n\ncs\n\u1e41w =\n\u03c3(x)\u0393(x).\n4\u03c0Gt2\n\n(9)\n\nThus, the accretion rate becomes \u1e40acc = \u22122\u03c0r\u03a3vr =\n(c3s /G)\u1e41, where \u1e41 = x(\u2212u)\u03c3 is the non-dimensional similarity accretion rate. Now, we can write equations (1), (3)\nand (4) as\n\u2212\u03c3 \u2212 x\n\nd\u03c3\n1 d\n+\n(x\u03c3u) + \u03c3\u0393 = 0,\ndx\nx dx\n\ndu\nu\u2212x\nv2\n2 d\u03c3\n+ (u \u2212 x)\n\u2212\u03c3\n\u2212\n= 0,\n\u03c3 dx\ndx\nx\nx\n(l2 \u0393 + 1)j + (u \u2212 x)\n\ndj\n1 d\ndj\n= \u03b1\u2032\n[\u03c3x(\u22122j + x )].\ndx\n\u03c3x dx\ndx\n\n(10)\n(11)\n(12)\n\nWe can solve the above differential equations numerically subject to appropriate asymptotic behaviors as boundary conditions. But we restrict to solution in slow accretion\nlimit which implies v \u226b 1, \u03c3 \u226b 1 and |u| \u226a 1. Then, equation (11) gives v = \u03c3 1/2 (x \u2212 u)1/2 or\nj = \u03c3 1/2 x(x \u2212 u)1/2 .\n\n(13)\n\nOn the other hand, equation (10) can be rewritten as\nd ln \u03c3\ndu\n1\nx\u0393\n=\n\u22121\u2212\n.\nd ln x\nx \u2212 u d ln x\nu\u2212x\n\n(14)\n\nd ln j\n1 1\ndu\n1 d ln \u03c3\n=1+\n(x \u2212\n)+\n.\nd ln x\n2x\u2212u\nd ln x\n2 d ln x\n\n(15)\n\nd ln j\n2x \u2212 u + x\u0393\n=\n.\nd ln x\n2(x \u2212 u)\n\n(16)\n\nAlso, after mathematical manipulation, from equation\n(13) we have\n\nSubstituting equation (14) into equation (15), we obtain\n\nUsing equation (16) the similarity angular momentum\nequation (12) is written as\n3u \u2212 2x + x\u0393\n1 d\nu\n+ (2l2 \u2212 1)\u0393 = \u03b1\u2032\n[\u03c3xj(\n)].\nx\n\u03c3xj dx\nx\u2212u\n\n(17)\n\nEquations (14) and (16) give\nd ln(\u03c3xj)\ndu\n1\n2x \u2212 u + 3x\u0393\n=\n+\n.\nd ln x\nx \u2212 u d ln x\n2(x \u2212 u)\n\n(18)\n\nThe above relation helps us to simplify equation (17) as\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fThe influence of winds on the time-dependent behaviour of self-gravitating accretion discs\nAx2 + Bux + 3u2 (x \u2212 u)2 [u + (2l2 \u2212 1)x\u0393)]\ndu\n=\u2212\n\u2212\n,(19)\ndx\n2(x \u2212 3u \u2212 2x\u0393)x\n\u03b1\u2032 (x \u2212 3u \u2212 2x\u0393)x\nwhere\nd\n(x\u0393) \u2212 3\u03932 ,\ndx\nd\nB = \u22122[3 + 4\u0393 \u2212\n(x\u0393)].\ndx\n\nA = 4 + 6\u0393 \u2212 2\n\nFirst order differential equation (19) is the main equation of\nour analysis which can be solved numerically. Having profile of u(x) from equation (19), the similarity surface density variable is calculated using equation (14) numerically.\nClearly, the effect of wind or outflows appears by the term \u0393.\nIf we set this parameter equal to zero, equation (19) reduces\nto equation (18) of Mineshige & Umemura (1997) which describes no-wind solution.\nBehavior of the solutions with winds highly depends on\nthe profile of the mean vertical velocity at the disc surface,\ni.e. \u0393. However, asymptotic behavior of the solutions near\nto the central part of the disc, i.e. x \u2192 0, is similar to a case\nwithout wind/outflow according to equations (14) and (19).\nWhen x tends to zero, we have\n|u| \u221d x, \u03c3 \u221d x\u22125/3 , v \u221d x\u22121/3 .\n\n(20)\n\nAppropriate boundary condition at x = 0 is determined using the above asymptotic behavior. For starting the integration of equation (19), we assume u = 0 at x = 0. But in\norder to determine surface density profile, we can integrate\nequation (14) from outer boundary of the disc, i.e. x = 1, towards the center for a given \u03c3(x = 1) = \u03c30 . But we consider\na series of models where the accretion rate at the outer edge\n(i.e., the inflow rate from the parent cloud) is kept constant,\nwhich appears a natural requirement. Thus, our boundary\nconditions are u = 0 at x = 0, and, \u1e41 = \u1e410 at x = 1. So,\nthere is another input parameter for our model, i.e. \u1e410 . For\nthe mass loss profile, we consider a simple power-law form\nfor \u0393 as \u0393 = \u03930 xs . We find two different regimes according\nto our similarity solution: inner no-wind part and an outer\nregion with the surface density profile in proportion to x\u22121 .\nThus, our prescription for vz+ /cs = \u0393/\u03c3 gives us a power law\nmass loss rate for the wind as \u1e40w \u221d xs+1 . In steady state\ncase, this prescription for mass loss by wind has been used\nwidely by many authors (e.g., Quataert & Narayan 1999;\nBeckert 2000; Turolla & Dullemond 2000; Misra & Taam\n2001; Fukue 2004).\n\n3\n\nANALYSIS\n\nNote that we are doing a purely parametric approach to take\ninto account effects of wind on a self-gravitating accretion\ndisc. So, this does not ensure that a self-consistent solution\nexists for any given set of the specified parameters. For solving the equations, we check out that solutions do not violate\ntwo important constraints: (a) the mass loss rate by the wind\nmust be less than the accretion rate, (b) the slow accretion\nlimit is satisfied. We restrict our study to positive values for\nthe exponent s, because for s < 0 we found qualitatively\nsimilar results. Note that in our model we have \u1e40w \u221d xs+1\nand x \u2264 1 which imply a stronger outflow for a smaller positive index s . Our parameterized approach is nevertheless\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n3\n\nuseful, because it illustrates the possible effects of winds on\nthe time-dependent structure of a self-gravitating disc.\nFigure 1 shows the change in the profiles of the physical variables with the mass loss power-law index s. Each\ncurve is labeled by corresponding index s. Also, we adopt\n\u03b1\u2032 = 0.1, \u1e410 = 0.2, \u03930 = 0.1 and l = 1 (i.e., rotating wind).\nThe surface density and the rotational velocity for the nowind solution are represented by \u03a30 and v0,\u03c6 . We find that\nthe structure is represented by an inner region with a density\nprofile in proportion to x\u22125/3 and an outer part with density\nprofile proportional to x\u22121 , irrespective of the existence of\nwind or outflow. The transition radius at xtr \u223c \u03b1\u2032 separates\nthe inner and outer parts. However, the surface density decreases at all parts of the disc because of the wind. In order\nto make an easier comparison, the ratio (\u03a3 \u2212 \u03a30 )/\u03a30 versus the similarity variable x is shown in Figure 1 (top, left).\nThe surface density reduction is more significant for smaller\nvalues of the exponent s. As the wind becomes stronger and\nmore mass is extracted from the disc, reduction to the surface density is more significant.\nProfile of the rotational velocity versus the similarity\nvariable is also shown in Figure 1 (top, right). Generally,\nsolutions with winds will rotate slower than those without\nwinds. So, the viscous dissipation per unit mass in the flow\nis expected to be smaller in the presence of a wind. The\nreduced rotational velocity of the disc is sensitive to the\nvariations of the exponent s. Also, profile of the radial velocity in Figure 1 (middle, left) shows significant deviations\nfrom no-wind solution because of the presence of winds. The\nradial velocity is approximately uniform in the outer parts\nof a disc without winds. But when the wind carries away the\nangular momentum appropriate to the radius from which it\nis launched, the remaining gas in the outer parts of the disc\nhas much larger radial velocity in comparison to the no-wind\nsolution. As wind becomes stronger, deviations of the radial\nvelocity from the no-wind solution is occurring over a larger\nregion of the disc. Velocity of the wind at the surface of the\ndisc is shown in Figure 1 (middle, right). We can simply\nshow that vz+ /cs \u221d xs+1 at the outer part of the disc. When\nthe exponent s increases, velocity of the wind at the surface\nof the disc decreases.\nProfile of the accretion rate, \u1e40acc , is shown in Figure 1\n(bottom, left). Accretion rate for the no-wind solution is represented by the dotted lines. We can see that the accretion\nrate decreases at all parts of the disc due to the existence of\nthe wind. However, the accretion rate is not very sensitive\nto the variations of the exponent s. Ratio of the mass loss\nrate due to the wind to the accretion rate, i.e. \u1e40w /\u1e40acc , is\nrepresented in Figure 1 (bottom, right). In the inner part\nof the disc, the mass loss by wind is negligible except for a\nstrong wind corresponding to s = 0.1. We adopted the input\nparameters so that the ratio is less than one at all radii of\nthe disc. But most of the mass loss by wind is occurring at\nlarge radii, i.e. outer part of the disc. For a stronger wind,\na larger fraction of the mass carries away by the wind.\nWe explore possible effects of extraction of angular momentum in Figure 2 by changing the parameter l. In this\nfigure, we assume \u03b1\u2032 = 0.1, \u1e410 = 0.2 and l = 0.0, 0.5,\n1.0, 1.5 with \u03930 = 0.1 and s = 0.7. Obviously, angular momentum is not extracted by the wind when we have l = 0.\n\n\f4\n\nM.

To make an\neasier comparison, Toomre parameter for a case without\nwind/outflow is represented in Figure 4. This plot shows\nthat Toomre parameter increases due to the existence of\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\nQ\n\nActually, this case corresponds to a non-rotating wind and\nthe disc losses only mass because of the wind. However, we\nfound that for l2 < 1/2 the mass of the disc increases in\nthe presence of the winds that is obviously unphysical. It is\npartly because of the limitations of similarity method that\nthere is not a self-consistent solution for any given set of\nthe input parameters, and more importantly, our model is\nvalid in the slow accretion limit (i.e., v \u226b 1), and so it is\nvery unlikely to accept that winds are lunched without extracting a certain amount of angular momentum of the disc.\nAlthough solutions with l = 0 and 0.5 are represented in Figure 2 for making a comparison, we think, these solutions are\nnot physically acceptable. Surface density profile is shown in\nFigure 2 (top, left). Again, we see reduction to the surface\ndensity because of the wind. Also, rotational velocity of the\ndisc decreases when there is significant angular momentum\nloss by the wind (top, right). Although the radial velocity\nof the inner disc does not change because of the wind, existence of the a rotating wind enhances the radial velocity\nat the outer part of the disc in comparison to a no-wind solution (middle, left). Typical behavior of velocity vz+ is also\nsensitive to the amount of the extracted angular momentum\n(middle, right). Profile of the accretion rate (bottom, left)\nshows that the accretion rate decreases due to the existence\nof a rotating wind. However, as more angular momentum is\ncarried away by the wind (i.e. larger l), not only the surface\ndensity and the rotational velocity are reduced at all regions\nof the disc, but the radial velocity is increases significantly\nat the outer part of the disc.\nAnother input parameter of our model is \u03930 that its\npossible effects are explored in Figure 3. We assume that\n\u03b1\u2032 = 0.1, \u1e410 = 0.2 and \u03930 = 0.1, 0.05, 0.01 with l = 1.0\nand s = 0.7. Again, the surface density and the rotational\nand radial velocities are significantly decreasing with \u03930 .\nThe velocity of the wind at the surface of the disc is highly\naffected by the parameter \u03930 (middle, right). Thus, the accretion rate and the mass loss by the wind are decreased\nwith the parameter \u03930 .\nThe effect of the disc self-gravity in this paper is limited\nto provide the radial gravitational field to keep the disc in\ncentrifugal equilibrium. On the other hand, it is well known\nthat self-gravitating discs can be unstable if they are too\ncold. We can study gravitational stability of the solutions\nusing the Toomre criteria (Toomre 1964),\ncs \u03ba\nQ=\n,\n(21)\n\u03c0G\u03a3\n\n7\n\n2\n\nno-wind solution\n1\n\n0\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\nlog (x)\n\nFigure 4.

But except\nto the very inner part of the disc, generally, Toomre parameter is still larger than one even in the presence of winds.\nHowever, we note that similarity solutions are not valid at\nthe regions very close to the inner or outer parts of the system. Larger the accretion rate at the outer edge of discs\n(i.e. larger \u1e410 ), the disc becomes more massive and the size\nof the gravitationally unstable inner region increases due to\nthe existence of wind/outflow.\n\n4\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nOur similarity solution show that the transition radius increases linearly with time, i.e. rtr \u2248 \u03b1\u2032 cs t. Assuming that\nthe radius rtr is very close to the central part of the disc initially, there is not \"no-wind\" region initially and wind exists\nat all radii of the disc. At early times of evolution, wind does\nnot modify the surface density significantly. As gas accretes\ntoward the central parts, the surface density profile changes\nfrom inside. However, the accretion rate is reduced initially\nbecause of the wind, in comparison to the no-wind solution.\nSome fraction of the accreted mass and the angular momentum can be carried away to infinity by the wind, while\nleaving the remaining flow with smaller density at all parts\nand enhanced radial velocity at the outer part of the disc.\nWe can apply our similarity solutions to a selfgravitating disc just before forming a central star, namely, in\nthe runaway collapse phase. This phase of evolution would\ncorrespond to the very early (class 0) stage. A molecular cloud core can be approximated by an isothermal gas\n\n\f8\n\nM. Shadmehri\nTable 1.

Having our similarity solutions, we can\nsimply calculate this integral for different set of input parameters. When there is not a wind or outflow, the integral\nbecomes I = 1.28. But existence of a wind or outflow decreases the integral by a factor up to 2 depending on the\ninput parameters (see Table 1). In other words, the mass of\na self-gravitating disc with wind is reduced comparing to a\nsimilar disc but without wind. So, reduction to the mass of\na disc with wind is mainly due to the decreased surface density at all regions of the disc. This implies that the central\nmass object is forming up to two times slower than a system without wind. Of course, this factor may increase if we\nconsider cases, in which more angular momentum is carried\naway by wind (i.e., larger l). We can determine how long is\nneeded to increase the mass of the disc by one solar mass.\nAccording to equation (25), we can write\n0.52 \u00d7 106\nyr.\n(26)\nI\nFor a disc without wind, the mass of the disc increases by\none solar mass within approximately \u03c4 \u2243 4.0 \u00d7 105 yr. But\nthe integral I decreases by a factor up to 2 according to\nTable 1. This allows the formation of a central core with\none solar mass in 2 times slower than a similar system without wind, i.e. \u03c4 \u2243 9 \u00d7 105 yr. This result is consistent with\nnumerical simulations of early stages of massive discs with\nwinds/outflows (e.g., Banerjee & Pudritz 2007). Numerical\nstudy of Banerjee & Pudritz (2007) is concentrated towards\nanalyzing massive star formation and inseparable links between gravitational collapse and early wind-driven outflows.\nThey showed that the disc, in the early stages of formation of\na high mass star, is more massive than the protostar that is\nforming within it (see also Banerjee & Pudritz 2006). Dominance of mass of the disc is kept within 7\u00d7104 yr according to\nthe simulations of Banerjee & Pudritz (2006).

Also, the other analytical studies show that the\ncentral core grows to one solar mass in 1.6 \u00d7 106 yr if other\neffects are ignored (e.g., Tsuribe 1999)\nAlthough we presented the ratio of the total mass loss\nrate by wind to the accretion rate at each radius of the\ndisc in Figures 1, 2 and 3, it is desirable to calculate how\nmuch mass is lost by wind during the early stages. Actually,\nobservations of different systems show that the ratio of mass\nloss rate by wind to the accretion rate is around 0.1 (e.g.,\nKonigl & Pudritz 2000). Having the self-similar solutions,\none can simply show that the total mass-loss rate by the\nwind is\n\u1e40w = (1.9 \u00d7 10\u22126 M\u2299 /yr)J ,\n\n(27)\n\nR1\n\nwhere J = 0 x\u03c3\u0393dx. Obviously, exact value of this integral\ndepends on the profiles of the physical quantities of the disc,\ni.e. \u03c3 and \u0393. Table 1 shows this integral for the solutions\nwith different sets of the input parameters. We can simply\nshow that during formation of a core with one solar mass the\namount of mass loss by the wind is J /I times the accreted\nmass. This ratio varies approximately from 0.001 to 0.05\naccording to Table 1. Thus, our mass loss rate is consistent\nwith observations of protostellar systems.\nOur solutions are valid as long as a central mass has\nnot been formed and the outer disc is not depleted with\ngas. Thus, there is no surprise that the similarity solution\ndemands a diverging total mass like a solution without wind,\nif x tends to infinity (Mineshige & Umemura 1997). But we\nrestricted our solutions within x \u2264 1, and so, the total mass\nof the disc is finite. Once the outer part of the disc is depleted\nwith gas and a central mass is formed, we can not apply our\nsimilarity solution with wind. However, the effects of wind on\nthe early evolution of self-gravitating discs are remarkably\nworth to be considered, in particular reduced surface density\nand the accretion rate at all parts of the disc.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI thank an anonymous referee for his/her constructive comments.\n\nREFERENCES\nBally J., Reipurth B., Davis C.
