This problem which models the backscattering of an incoherent laser\nby an optically active medium was first considered by Akhmanov et al. in nonlinear optics\n[1], and by Rose and DuBois in laser-plasma interaction [10]. The latter investigated the\ndivergence of the average solution to the stochastic PDE\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 \u2202 E(x, t) \u2212 i \u2206E(x, t) = \u03bb|S(x, t)|2 E(x, t),\nt\n2m\n\uf8f3 t \u2265 0, x \u2208 \u039b \u2282 Rd , and E(x, 0) = 1,\n\n(1)\n\nheuristically and numerically in the \"diffractive case\" where Im(m) = 0 and Re(m) 6= 0.\n\nHere \u03bb > 0 is the coupling constant and S is a complex Gaussian noise with zero mean 1 .\nMore recently, this problem was analyzed from a more rigorous mathematical point of view\n\nin [2] and [7]. The \"diffusive case\" in which Re(m) = 0 and Im(m) > 0 was considered in\n[2], and the one dimensional diffractive case was considered in [7] for a restrictive class of\nS's. In the present work we will consider the general case m 6= 0 and Im(m) \u2265 0 for \u039b a\nd-dimensional torus with d \u2264 3. As in [2] and [7] we will express the solution to (1) formally\nas the Feynman-Kac path-integral\nZ\nE(x, t) =\n\nx(*)\u2208B(x,t)\n\nt im\n2\n2\ne 0 [ 2 \u1e8b(\u03c4 ) +\u03bb|S(x(\u03c4 ),\u03c4 )| ] d\u03c4 d[x(*)],\n\nR\n\n(2)\n\nwhere B(x, t) denotes the set of all the continuous paths in \u039b satisfying x(t) = x.\nIn the diffusive case, the right-hand side of (2) is just the Wiener integral of\n\u0010 R\n\u0011\nt\n2\nexp \u03bb 0 |S(x(\u03c4 ), \u03c4 )| d\u03c4 over B(x, t). This was used in [2] to prove, under some reasonable assumptions on the covariance of S, that for every t > 0 and any positive integer\n\nq the average of E(x, t)q over the realizations of S, hE(x, t)q i, diverges as \u03bb increases past\nsome critical value smaller (or equal) than in the diffusion-free case (i.e. when |m| = +\u221e),\nwith equality holding for a class of S. It was conjectured there that this inequality should\nalso apply when diffusion is replaced by diffraction, i.e. m real, m 6= 0, the case of physical\ninterest considered by Rose and DuBois in [10].\n1\n\nThis is the case of interest in laser-plasma interaction and nonlinear optics in which S is the (complex)\ntime-enveloppe of the laser electric field. With the help of some minor modifications, our results carry\nover straightforwardly to the cases where S is real.\n\n2\n\n\fThe diffractive case is much more difficult because the right-hand side of (2) is no longer\nwell defined and one cannot a priori exclude the possibility that destructive interference\nbetween paths makes the sum of divergent contributions finite, raising (possibly to infinity)\nthe critical value of \u03bb at which the average of (2) diverges. Using heuristics and numerical\nsimulations, Rose and DuBois argued that h|E(x, t)|2i should diverge for every t > 0 as\n\u03bb increases to some finite critical value [10]. The conjecture made in [2] that diffraction\nshould actually lower the critical coupling (or, at least, not increase it) compared to the case\n|m| = +\u221e was proved in [7], for very special choices of S, for the divergence of h|E(x, t)|i.\nIn this paper, we extend the results of [7] to a much wider class of S. We analyze\nthe divergence of h|E(x, t)|q i for any positive integer q, and we treat both the diffusive and\ndiffractive cases as well as all the intermediate cases between these two limits [i.e. complex\nm with Im(m) \u2265 0 and m 6= 0]. Our strategy for controlling the complex Feynman pathintegral (2) and determining the critical value of \u03bb uses the following three ingredients:\n\n(i) we consider a restricted but quite wide class of S for which E(x, t) can be written as\na Fourier-Laplace integral w.r.t. a distribution with compact support;\n\n2\n\n(ii) we apply the Paley-Wiener theorem to this Fourier-Laplace integral. This yields the\ncontrol of (2) for \"large\" |S|2 ;\n(iii) we average |E(x, t)|q over the realizations of S and use the control obtained in (ii) to\ndetermine the smallest value of \u03bb for which this average blows up.\nThe rest of the paper follows this strategy quite faithfully. In Section II we specify the\nclass of S which we can treat. The distributional formulation of E(x, t) is given in Section\nIII and the way to control its growth is explained in Section IV. Finally, the determination\nof the critical value of \u03bb and the proof of the conjecture made in [2] are given in Section V.\nIt is worth noting that (i) and (ii) do not depend on S being Gaussian and thus apply also\nin a more general setting.\n2\n\nThe \"Fourier-Laplace\" integral w.r.t. a distribution with compact support on RN is the continuation of\nthe usual Fourier integral from RN to CN .\n\n3\n\n\fII.\n\nMODEL AND DEFINITIONS\n\nWe consider the solution to the linear amplifier equation (1), written in its integral\nrepresentation (2), with m in C+ \\{0}, where C+ \u2261 {m \u2208 C : Im(m) \u2265 0}. We assume that\nS can be expressed as a finite combination of M complex Gaussian r.v., sn ,\nS(x, t) =\n\nM\nX\n\nsn \u03a6n (x, t),\n\n(3)\n\nn=1\n\nwith\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 hs i = hs s i = 0,\nn\nn m\n\uf8f3 hsn s\u2217 i = \u03b4nm .\n\n(4)\n\nm\n\nThe \u03a6n are normalized such that\n1\n|\u039b|\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\nM\n\n1 X\nh|S(x, \u03c4 )| i d\u03c4 d x =\n|\u039b| n=1\n\u039b\n\nZ\n\n2\n\nd\n\nZ\n\n1\n0\n\nZ\n\n\u039b\n\n|\u03a6n (x, \u03c4 )|2 d\u03c4 dd x = 1.\n\nFurthermore, the \u03a6n (*, \u03c4 ) are assumed to have second derivatives bounded uniformly in\n\u03c4 \u2208 [0, t], and the \u03a6n (x, *) are piecewise continuous for every x \u2208 \u039b with a finite number of\ndiscontinuities in [0, t] for all finite t. Note that locally, i.e. for each x and \u03c4 , |S(x, \u03c4 )|2 is a\nquadratic form of 2M real Gaussian r.v. (the real and imaginary parts of the sn ), so it is a\n\u03c72 r.v. with 2M degrees of freedom.\nEquation (3) generalizes models of spatially smoothed laser beams in which the laser\nlight is represented by a superposition of a finite number of monochromatic beamlets the\namplitudes of which are independent r.v. [9]. For a large number of beamlets these r.v.\ncan be taken as Gaussian and the laser electric field takes on the form (3) with \u03a6n (x, t) \u221d\nexp[i(kn * x + akn2 t)], where kn is the wave vector of the nth beamlet and a > 0 is a (real)\nconstant. It can be checked that all the assumptions made on S are fulfilled.\nWe are interested in the critical coupling \u03bbq (x, t) and its Laplacian-free counterpart\n\u03bbq (x, t) obtained by setting m\u22121 = 0 in Eq. (1).

(11) in which \u03a8 is replaced by \u03a8\u0303. By the Paley-Wiener\ntheorem in the formulation given in [11] (Theorem XVI in Chapter VII), it follows from\nthe analyticity of \u03a8\u0303(x, t; \u03b7) in \u03b7 and Eq. (21) that G\u0303x,t is a distribution with compact\nsupport on RN and suppG\u0303x,t \u2282 [\u2212\u03ba1 , \u03ba1 ] \u00d7 ... \u00d7 [\u2212\u03baN , \u03baN ]. From the definition of \u03a8\u0303 one\nhas G\u0303x,t (u) = Gx,t (u \u2212 ct), which implies immediately by translation that Gx,t is also a\n\ndistribution with compact support on RN and suppGx,t \u2282 [\u03b11 , \u03b21 ] \u00d7 ... \u00d7 [\u03b1N , \u03b2N ], where\nRt\nRt\n\u03b1i = 0 inf x\u2208\u039b \u03c6i (\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 and \u03b2i = 0 supx\u2208\u039b \u03c6i (\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 . The permutation of time integral and\nspace supremum (resp. infimum) can then be performed by using Lemma A1 with W = \u00b1\u03c6i\n\n(see Appendix A).

(9) can be written as E(x, t; s) = \u03a8(x, t; \u03b7 = i\u03bbk(s))\nwhich is the solution to (14) with \u03b7 = i\u03bbk(s) in the potential (13). It can be checked that the\nlatter equation is indeed Equation (1) [reconstruct s\u2020 \u03b3s from its monomial decomposition\nand multiply (14) by \u2212i], which completes the proof of Lemma 1.\nIV.\n\nCONTROLLING THE GROWTH OF |E(x, t; s)|q\n\nThe advantage gained by recasting (6) as (9) is that the latter formulation is suitable for\na straightforward application of the Paley-Wiener theorem (see e.g. [11] Theorem XVI in\nChapter VII, and [6] Theorem 7.4 in Chapter VI), offering the possibility of controlling the\ngrowth of E(x, t; s) as ksk \u2192 +\u221e.

Since we wish to express the results in terms of eigenvalues of the\ncorrelation function hS \u2217 (x(t), t)S(x(t\u2032 ), t\u2032 )i, we begin with a technical preliminary linking\nRt\nthese eigenvalues to those of the matrix 0 \u03b3(x(\u03c4 ), \u03c4 ) d\u03c4 .\nLet \u03bc1 [x(*)] \u2265 \u03bc2 [x(*)] \u2265 * * * \u2265 0 be the eigenvalues of the covariance operator Tx(*)\n\nacting on f (\u03c4 ) \u2208 L2 (d\u03c4 ), defined by\nZ t\n(Tx(*) f )(\u03c4 ) =\nhS \u2217 (x(\u03c4 ), \u03c4 )S(x(\u03c4 \u2032 ), \u03c4 \u2032 )if (\u03c4 \u2032 ) d\u03c4 \u2032 ,\n\n(26)\n\n0\n\nwith 0 \u2264 \u03c4, \u03c4 \u2032 \u2264 t and x(*) \u2208 B(x, t).

Conversely, any non vanishRt\ning eigenvalue of 0 \u03b3(x(\u03c4 ), \u03c4 ) d\u03c4 is also eigenvalue of Tx(*) with eigenfunction fi (\u03c4 ) =\nPM\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u03bc\u22121\ni\nm=1 \u03c3im \u03a6m (x(\u03c4 ), \u03c4 ) [see Eq.

In the sequel \u03bc1 [x(*)] will denote\nRt\nthe largest eigenvalue of Tx(*) and of 0 \u03b3(x(\u03c4 ), \u03c4 ) d\u03c4 .

We have considered a model\nin which the propagation is that of a free Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a complex mass. For\nthis model, we have explicitely determined the values of the coupling constant at which the\nmoments of the solution diverge. We proved that the divergence yielded by a propagationfree calculation, i.e. in the limit of an infinite mass, cannot occur at a smaller coupling\nconstant than the one obtained with a finite mass. This extends the results of Ref. [2] where\nsuch an inequality was proven in the diffusion case only, i.e. imaginary mass.\nAs explained in the conclusion of Ref. [2], the stumbling block to going beyond the\npurely diffusive case was to control the growth of a complex Feynman path-integral. Our\n13\n\n\fsolution of this problem is based on the realization that, if S is given by Eq. (3), the Feynman\npath-integral can be rewritten as the Fourier integral of a distribution with compact support\n(Lemma 1). Control can then be obtained as a consequence of the Paley-Wiener theorem\n(Lemma 2).\nIn conclusion we outline some possible generalizations of this work. From a practical\npoint of view, it would be interesting to find out whether there exists a class of S of the\nform (3) for which there is no propagation effects on the onset of the divergence, i.e. for\nwhich \u03bbq (x, t) = \u03bbq (x, t). In addition, since most Gaussian fields of physical interest admit\nKarhunen-Lo\u00e8ve-type expansions, it would also be very interesting to find a way to generalize\nour solution to the case where the finite sum (3) is replaced by an infinite sum. Other problems involve relaxing some of the assumptions in (1). For instance, under what conditions\non S do the results carry over to the case where \u039b is replaced by Rd and E(x, 0) \u2208 L2 (Rd ).\nIt should also be checked whether our solution of the problem is robust with respect to the\ninitial condition. If the answer is no, the size of the set of E(x, 0) for which our results do not\nhold should be estimated according to physically relevant measures on the space of E(x, 0).\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe warmly thank K.

Let \u039b be a compact pathwise connected metric space [with distance denoted by d(*, *)], and t > 0 a real number. Let W be a real function on \u039b \u00d7 [0, t] such\nthat W (*, \u03c4 ) is continuous in x uniformly in \u03c4 \u2208 [0, t], and \u2200x \u2208 \u039b, W (x, *) is piecewise\n\n14\n\n\fcontinuous with a finite number of discontinuities. Then, for any x \u2208 \u039b\nZ t\nZ t\nsup W (y, \u03c4 ) d\u03c4 = sup\nW (x(\u03c4 ), \u03c4 ) d\u03c4,\n0 y\u2208\u039b\n\nx(*)\u2208B(x,t)\n\n0\n\nwhere B(x, t) is the set of continuous paths in \u039b satisfying x(t) = x.\nProof. We obviously have\nZ t\nsup W (y, \u03c4 ) d\u03c4 \u2265\n0 y\u2208\u039b\n\nsup\nx(*)\u2208B(x,t)\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nW (x(\u03c4 ), \u03c4 ) d\u03c4,\n0\n\nand it remains to prove the inequality in the other direction. First we assume W \u2208 C 0 (\u039b \u00d7\n[0, t]). Since \u039b\u00d7[0, t] is compact, W is uniformly continuous, and for every \u01eb > 0 we can find a\nnumber \u03b4 = \u03b4(\u01eb) > 0 such that if max{d(x, x\u2032 ), |\u03c4 \u2212\u03c4 \u2032 |} < \u03b4(\u01eb), then |W (x, \u03c4 )\u2212W (x\u2032 , \u03c4 \u2032 )| < \u01eb.\nMoreover, \u03b4(\u01eb) tends to zero with \u01eb. If t/\u03b4(\u01eb) is not an integer, it is convenient to replace\n\u03b4(\u01eb) by the smaller quantity t/(1 + [t/\u03b4(\u01eb)]) where [*] denotes the integer part, and from now\non we will assume that t/\u03b4(\u01eb) is an integer. For a fixed \u01eb > 0, let N = N(\u01eb) = t/\u03b4(\u01eb), and\nlet R\u01eb be a finite partition of \u039b by sets of diameter at most \u03b4(\u01eb).

We also choose a continuous\n\npath x0 from [0, t/2N 2 ] to \u039b such that x0 (0) = y1 and x0 (t/2N 2 ) = xF0 ,0 , and a continuous\npath xN from [\u2212t/2N 2 , 0] to \u039b such that xN (0) = y2 and xN (\u2212t/2N 2 ) = xFN\u22121 ,N \u22121 .

Since \u039b is compact and \u2200\u03c4 \u2208 [0, t], W (*, \u03c4 ) \u2208 C 0 (\u039b), there is a\n\nfinite number M > 0 such that for any (x, \u03c4 ) \u2208 \u039b \u00d7 [0, t] one has |W (x, \u03c4 )| \u2264 M. Thus,\n|W (xFq ,q , \u03c4 ) \u2212 W (x\u01eb (\u03c4 ), \u03c4 )| \u2264 2M for any \u03c4 in [qt/N, (q + 1)t/N]. Using the latter estimate,\nthe remark below (A3), and (A2) one obtains\nZ\n\nt\n\nsup W (y, \u03c4 ) d\u03c4 =\n\n0 y\u2208\u039b\n\nN\n\u22121 Z (q+1)t/N\nX\nqt/N\n\nq=0\n\n\u2264 \u01ebt +\n\nsup W (y, \u03c4 ) d\u03c4\ny\u2208\u039b\n\nN\n\u22121 Z (q+1)t/N\nX\nq=0\n\nW (xFq ,q , \u03c4 ) d\u03c4\n\n(A4)\n\nqt/N\n\n2Mt\n\u2264 \u01ebt +\n+\nN\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nW (x\u01eb (\u03c4 ), \u03c4 ) d\u03c4,\n0\n\nNow, assume that there is a finite set of times independent of x, {\u03c41 , ..., \u03c4L }, such that\n\u2200x \u2208 \u039b the set of times at which W (x, *) is discontinuous is a subset of {\u03c41 , ..., \u03c4L }. Thus,\n(A4) applies in each time interval [\u03c4i , \u03c4i+1 ], 0 \u2264 i \u2264 L, with \u03c40 = 0 and \u03c4L+1 = t. Let\ny0 , y1 , ..., yL+1 be L + 2 points in \u039b with yL+1 = x. Let x\u01eb be a continuous path in \u039b passing\nby x\u01eb (\u03c4i ) = yi and defined by (A3) in each time interval [\u03c4i , \u03c4i+1 ].

The proof of Lemma A1\nfor the class of W considered in this paragraph is completed by taking the limit \u01eb \u2192 0 and\nobserving that the Ci (\u01eb) tend to zero with \u01eb.\nWe are now ready to prove Lemma 1 in the general case. Since W (*, \u03c4 ) is continuous\nin x uniformly in \u03c4 \u2208 [0, t], for any \u01eb > 0, we can find \u03b4 = \u03b4(\u01eb) > 0 such that if d(x, x\u2032 ) \u2264 \u03b4,\nthen\nsup |W (x, \u03c4 ) \u2212 W (x\u2032 , \u03c4 )| \u2264 \u01eb.\n\n\u03c4 \u2208[0,t]\n\nSince \u039b is compact, we can find a finite covering by open balls of radius at most \u03b4/2, and\ntherefore a finite partition of unity (\u03c7k ) by continuous functions whose support has diameter\nat most \u03b4 (see [3], paragraph 4.3 in Chapter IX). For any k we choose once for all a point\nxk \u2208 supp\u03c7k , and define the function\nW\u01eb (x, \u03c4 ) =\n\nX\n\nW (xk , \u03c4 )\u03c7k (x).\n\nk\n\nFor each fixed \u03c4 , this function is obviously continuous in x, and for fixed x, it is piecewise\ncontinuous in \u03c4 , with the possible discontinuity points belonging to a finite set which can\nbe chosen independent of x. From the previous result we have\nZ t\nZ t\nsup W\u01eb (y, \u03c4 ) d\u03c4 = sup\nW\u01eb (x(\u03c4 ), \u03c4 ) d\u03c4.\n0 y\u2208\u039b\n\nx(*)\u2208B(x,t)\n\n0\n\nSince supx\u2208\u039b,\u03c4 \u2208[0,t] |W (x, \u03c4 ) \u2212 W\u01eb (x, \u03c4 )| \u2264 \u01eb, we deduce that\nZ t\nZ t\nsup W (y, \u03c4 ) d\u03c4 \u2264 \u01ebt +\nsup W\u01eb (y, \u03c4 ) d\u03c4\n0 y\u2208\u039b\n\n0 y\u2208\u039b\n\n= \u01ebt +\n\nsup\nx(*)\u2208B(x,t)\n\n\u2264 2\u01ebt +\n\nZ\n\nsup\nx(*)\u2208B(x,t)\n\nt\n\nW\u01eb (x(\u03c4 ), \u03c4 ) d\u03c4\n0\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nW (x(\u03c4 ), \u03c4 ) d\u03c4.\n\n0\n\nSince the estimate holds for any \u01eb > 0 the general result follows.\n17\n\n\f(m)\n\nAPPENDIX B: DETERMINATION OF THE SUPPORT OF g(x,T )\n(m)\n\nLet gx,t (u) be a distribution with compact support on R whose Fourier transform,\n(m)\n\n\u03a8(m) (x, t; \u03b7) \u2261 (F gx,t )(\u03b7) with \u03b7 \u2208 R, is the solution to (14) with V (x, t; \u03b7) = \u03b7U(x, t; \u015d),\nP\nwhere U(x, t; \u015d) = N\ni=1 k\u0302(s)i \u03c6i (x, t). This appendix is devoted to the determination of the\n(m)\n\nsupport of g(x,t) . We have modified the notation used in the text to make the dependence\n\non m explicit.\nWe begin with a technical lemma that will be useful in the sequel. Let C0\u221e (R) denote\nthe set of all smooth compactly supported functions in R,\nLemma B1.

As a Fourier transform of a function with compact supports on R, (F f )(\u03b7) is\n\nan analytic function of \u03b7 \u2208 C. We have seen at the beginning of the proof of Lemma 1\n\nthat \u03a8(m) (x, t; \u03b7), with m \u2208 C+ , is also analytic in \u03b7. Furthermore, if \u039b is a torus and V\n\nis bounded on \u039b (which is the case), then (i) \u03a8(m) (x, t; \u03b7) is analytic in m \u2208 C+ ; and (ii)\n\n\u2200\u03b7 \u2208 C, \u03a8(m) (x, t; \u03b7) = lim\u03b3\u21920+ \u03a8(m+i\u03b3) (x, t; \u03b7) for each real m 6= 0. We are indebted to K.\n\nYajima for the proof of the latter result that we reproduce here for the sake of completeness\n[13]. Define\nUm (t) = exp\n\n\u0012\n\nit\u2206\n2m\n\n\u0013\n\n, t \u2265 0, m \u2208 C+ ,\n\nand write the initial value problem (14) in the the form of integral equation\nZ t\n(m)\n\u03a8 (t) = 1 \u2212 i\u03b7\nUm (t \u2212 \u03c4 )V (\u03c4 )\u03a8(m) (\u03c4 ) d\u03c4.\n0\n\nHere V (t) is the multiplication operator with U(x, t; \u015d). Let B denote the space of bounded\n\noperators in L2 (\u039b). By Fourier series expansion, it is evident that (a) ||Um (t)\u03a8(m) (t)||2 \u2264\n\n||\u03a8(m) (t)||2 , viz.

It is easy to check that Dm (t) defines\nthe propagator for (14) and is unitary if m is real. Hence the solution to (14) satisfies the\nproperties (i) and (ii).\nAnalyticity of \u03a8(m) (x, t; \u03b7) and (F f )(\u03b7) in m \u2208 C+ and \u03b7 \u2208 C implies that\nZ\nZ\nd\u03b7\n(m)\ngx,t (u)f (u) du \u2261\n\u03a8(m) (x, t; \u03b7)(F f )(\u2212\u03b7)\n2\u03c0\nR\nR\nis an analytic function of m \u2208 C+ .

Let h \u2208 C0\u221e (R) a real positive test function with support in [a, b] and supu\u2208R h(u) = 1.\n\nFrom the continuity of \u03b1[x(*)] it follows that \u2203x0 (*) \u2208 B(x, t) such that h(\u03b1[x0 (*)]) = 1. By\ncontinuity of h and \u03b1[x(*)] it follows that \u2200\u03b5 > 0, \u2203\u03b4 > 0 such that |h(\u03b1[x(*)]) \u2212 1| < \u03b5 for\nevery x(*) \u2208 B0 (\u03b4) \u2261 {x(*) \u2208 B(x, t) : sup0\u2264\u03c4 \u2264t kx(\u03c4 ) \u2212 x0 (\u03c4 )k < \u03b4}. Take \u03b5 = 1/2, in this\ncase h(\u03b1[x(*)]) > 1/2 for every x(*) \u2208 B0 (\u03b4) and one has\nZ\nZ\n\u03b3 Rt\n2\n(i\u03b3)\ngx,t (u)h(u) du =\ne\u2212 2 0 \u1e8b(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 h(\u03b1[x(*)]) d[x(*)]\nR\nx(*)\u2208B(x,t)\nZ\n\u03b3 Rt\n2\n\u2265\ne\u2212 2 0 \u1e8b(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 h(\u03b1[x(*)]) d[x(*)]\nx(*)\u2208B0 (\u03b4)\nZ\n\u03b3 Rt\n1\n2\ne\u2212 2 0 \u1e8b(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 d[x(*)].\n>\n2 x(*)\u2208B0 (\u03b4)\nSince the set of the Brownian paths x(*) that are in B0 (\u03b4) has a strictly positive Wiener\nmeasure, the last term is strictly positive and one finds\nZ\n(i\u03b3)\ngx,t (u)h(u) du > 0.\n\n(B1)\n\nR\n\n(i\u03b3)\n\nIf there was an open subset of [a, b] not intersecting the support of gx,t , it would be possible to\nR (i\u03b3)\n(i\u03b3)\nchoose the support of h outside the one of gx,t , yielding gx,t (u)h(u) du = 0 in contradiction\n(i\u03b3)\n\nwith Eq.

In this case it is possible to choose the support of\nR (m)\n(m)\n(z)\nh outside the one of gx,t , yielding gx,t (u)h(u) du = 0. By Lemma B1 the support of gx,t\n\nmust vary continuously with z \u2208 C+ , whence the support of h can be taken small enough\nR (z)\nsuch that there is a open subset V(m) \u2282 C+ with m \u2208 V(m) and gx,t (u)h(u) du = 0\nR (z)\nidentically in V(m).
