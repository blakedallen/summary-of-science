And the given spin determines the transformation of the field\ncomponents for rotations and boosts. But the usual construction restricts translations;\nthe components are simply invariant under translations.

The inhomogeneous Lorentz group, or Poincar\u00e9 group, of such transformations has both unitary and nonunitary representations.\nBy basic quantum theory, single particle states and their annihilation and creation operators that remove or add a single particle state to a multiparticle state must transform by\nunitary representations (reps) of the Poincar\u00e9 group. Since momentum generators commute,\nthe single particle states are sums of eigenstates of momentum. Then the annihilation and\ncreation operators that remove or add momentum eigenstates are defined over the allowed\nvalues of particle momenta.\nAmong the quantities in physics that transform with nonunitary representations of the\nPoincar\u00e9 group are fields, multicomponent objects defined over spacetime events. It is remarkable that fields can be constructed that are linear combinations of operators and with\ninvariant coefficients,[1, 2] sometimes called the Invariant Coefficient Hypothesis.\naffiliation and mailing address: Department of Applied Mathematics and Sciences, Wentworth Institute\nof Technology, 550 Huntington Avenue, Boston, MA, USA, ZIP 02115, telephone number: (617) 989-4338,\nfax number: (617) 989-4591 , e-mail address: shurtleffr@wit.edu\n\u2217\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\n2 MASSIVE FIELDS\n\nThe hypothesis yields unique free massive particle fields, within normalization factors.\nHowever the usual derivation limits the transformations of the field components to nonunitary\nreps of rotations and boosts, neglecting translations.\nIn this paper it is shown that it is mathematically unnecessary to limit component transformations to rotations and boosts. We show that the usual derivation can be modified so\nthat the field components transform with nonunitary reps of rotations, boosts and translations, the full complement of spacetime symmetries connected to the identity.\nThe result is that the field is obtained by applying a pure translation through a displacement x to the translation-deficient field obtained conventionally. Let D(1, x) indicate\na translation by displacement x, then the field \u03c8 found here can be written as\n(0)\n\n\u03c8l (x) = Dll\u0304 (1, x)\u03c8l\u0304 (x) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c8 (0) is the field found with the restriction that the transformations of the field components are limited to rotations and boosts. The massless class has been shown in an\nearlier paper[3] to have the same translation matrix dependence. Thus, for both the massive\nclass and the massless class, the effect of allowing nontrivial translations is to multiply the\ntranslation-deficient field by the translation matrix for the displacement x.\nTranslations are generated by the momentum and the momentum generators have a\nfree scale factor because the Poincar\u00e9 algebra is homogeneous in momentum generators.\nPredictions would require an investigation of the quantum mechanics of the generalized\nfields.\nSection 2 follows the procedure from Weinberg[1] closely, except that the field \u03c8 is required\nto transform with the Poincar\u00e9 group that includes translations. The result is described\nabove with equation (1). A brief discussion is presented in Section 3. Appendix A provides\na set of exercises and problems to develop understanding and instigate further study.\n\n2\n\nMassive Fields\n\nThe calculation here follows the approach explained in detail by Weinberg.[1]\nTranslation is a spacetime symmetry whose generators, the momentum operators, commute. Thus, by basic quantum theory, single particle states can be expressed in terms of\nmomentum eigenstates whose eigenvalues are the 'momentum' p. Let \u03a8p,\u03c3 be a single particle\neigenstate of momentum,\n\u03bc\n\u03a8p,\u03c3 = p\u03bc \u03a8p,\u03c3 ,\n(2)\nP(\u03a8)\nwhere P(\u03a8) is the momentum operator for the representation of the Poincar\u00e9 group realized\nby the spacetime symmetries of the states \u03a8p,\u03c3 and \u03c3 is the z-component of spin. The\n\n\f3\n\n2 MASSIVE FIELDS\n\n\u2192\n\u2192\nannihilation and creation operators a\u03c3 (\u2212\np ) and a\u2020\u03c3 (\u2212\np ) remove or add a single particle state\nwith momentum p and spin component \u03c3 to any multiparticle state.\nThe annihilation and creation operators are defined over the appropriate Wigner class of\nmomenta,[4, 5] p2 = \u2212m2 with pt \u2265 m > 0 and m is the particle mass. The energy pt can\n\u2192\n\u2192\nbe determined from the spatial three-vector \u2212\np , pt = (m2 + \u2212\np 2 )1/2 , so the operators depend\n\u2192\non the three spatial components of \u2212\np.\nThe field \u03c8l (x) is constructed as a linear combination of annihilation and creation operators, \u03c8l (x) = \u03ba\u03c8l+ (x) + \u03bb\u03c8l\u2212 (x), where the annihilation field \u03c8 + and the creation field \u03c8 \u2212\nare given by\nXZ\n\u2192\n\u2192\nd3 p ul\u03c3 (x, \u2212\np )a\u03c3 (\u2212\np ),\n\u03c8l+ (x) =\n\u03c3\n\n\u03c8l\u2212 (x) =\n\nXZ\n\u03c3\n\n\u2192\n\u2192\nd3 p vl\u03c3 (x, \u2212\np )a\u2020\u03c3 (\u2212\np ).\n\n(3)\n\n\u2192\nThe coefficients u and v depend on both x and\u2212\np and they connect the field components with\nthe operator components. Since the fields are linear combinations of operators, a field is also\nan operator. We reserve the term 'operator' for the annihilation and creation operators.\nThe coefficients u and v can be determined from the ways the fields and operators\ntransform to preserve spacetime symmetries: (i) the operators transform under Poincar\u00e9\ntransformations with a unitary representation (rep), (ii) the coefficients are required to be\ninvariant under Poincar\u00e9 transformations and (iii) the field transforms by a nonunitary rep\nof Poincar\u00e9 transformations. Remarkably, the unitary transformations of the operators a\nand a\u2020 can produce a non-unitary transformation of the fields \u03c8l\u00b1 . The three transformation\nregimens constrain the coefficients so much that the coefficients are essentially determined.\nThe annihilation and creation operators transform by a unitary representation of the\nPoincar\u00e9 transformation (\u039b, b).[1, 2] One has\ns\n\n(\u039bp)t X (j) \u22121\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2192\nU(\u039b, b)a\u03c3 (\u2212\np )U \u22121 (\u039b, b) = ei\u039bp*\u01eb(\u039b,b)\nD\u03c3\u03c3\u0304 (W )a\u03c3\u0304 (\u039bp) ,\nt\np\n\u03c3\u0304\n\u2192\nU(\u039b, b)a\u2020\u03c3 (\u2212\np )U \u22121 (\u039b, b)\n\n\u2212i\u039bp*\u01eb(\u039b,b)\n\n=e\n\ns\n\n(\u039bp)t X (j)\u2217 \u22121 \u2020 \u2212\n\u2192\nD\u03c3\u03c3\u0304 (W )a\u03c3\u0304 (\u039bp) ,\npt \u03c3\u0304\n\n(4)\n\nwhere j is the spin of the particle and the transformation W is a rotation given by\nW (\u039b, p) = L\u22121 (\u039bp)\u039bL(p) ,\n\n(5)\n\n\u2192\nwith L(p) a standard transformation taking k \u03bc = {0, 0, 0, m} to p. L(p) rotates \u2212\np to the z\n\u2192\n\u2212\ndirection, followed by a boost along z, followed by the rotation back to p . Since W (\u039b, p)k\n\n\f4\n\n2 MASSIVE FIELDS\n(j)\n\n= k, it follows that W is a rotation. The matrix D\u03c3\u03c3\u0304 (W \u22121 (\u039b, p)) represents the rotation\nW \u22121 for spin j.\nThe unitary transformation U(\u039b, b) is required to have the effect of a nonunitary transformation on the fields. One requires that\nU(\u039b, b)\u03c8l\u00b1 (x)U \u22121 (\u039b, b) =\n\nX\n\nDl\u22121\n(\u039b, b)\u03c8l\u0304\u00b1 (\u039bx + b) ,\nl\u0304\n\n(6)\n\nl\u0304\n\nwhere \u039bx+b are the transformed coordinates of the given event and D(\u039b, b) is the nonunitary\nmatrix representing the spacetime transformation (\u039b, b). The rep D(\u039b, b) is determined by\nthe spin composition of \u03c8, within equivalences. Let the spin composition of the field \u03c8\nbe (A, B) \u2295 (C, D) \u2295 . . . . The standard angular momentum generators and momentum\ngenerators for the nonunitary rep D(\u039b, b) can be found in Ref. [6].\nRecall that the way a multicomponent object transforms with rotations and boosts determines its spin composition. The spacetime symmetries of the Poincar\u00e9 group include also\ntranslations and that implies that a spin (A, B) field must be combined with one or more\nfields of allowed spins (A \u00b1 1/2, B \u00b1 1/2) in order to have nontrivial translation reps.[6] It\nfollows a spin (A, B) field must be accompanied by at least one spin (C, D) field to have a\nnontrivial rep.\nFor example a Dirac spinor has composition (1/2, 0) \u2295 (0, 1/2). Thus the transformations\nof a Dirac spinor qualify and there is a nontrivial rep of translations along with rotations\nand boosts. One hint is the existence of Dirac gamma matrices, which are vector matrices.\nVector matrices that commute are momentum matrices. In fact a Dirac spinor can realize\ntwo distinct reps of the Poincar\u00e9 group.\nWe proceed now to the derivation of the coefficients u and v, adapted from Ref. [1]. The\ncoefficients u and v are determined by assuming (i) the operators transform by (\u039b, b) as in\n(4) , (ii) the coefficients are invariant, and (iii) the fields transform by (\u039b, b) as in (6).
