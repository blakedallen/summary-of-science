The volatiles and dust stored in comet nuclei preserve a physico-chemical\nrecord for the conditions (temperature, pressure, radiation field density) under which\ncometary material formed (Wooden 2008; DiSanti & Mumma 2008; Bockel\u00e9e-Morvan\net al. 2004; Irvine et al. 2000; Mumma et al. 1993).\nComparing relative abundances of parent1 molecules (H2O, HCN, CO, etc.) in\ncomets to those found in the interstellar medium (ISM) and in disks around young stars\nis vital to understanding the different stages of planetary system formation and the\nprocessing history experienced by organic matter during the evolutionary transitions\nbetween these stages (see Charnley & Rodgers 2008a, 2008b; Carr & Najita 2008;\nEhrenfreund et al. 2006; Gibb et al. 2007a; Boogert et al. 2004; Nuth et al. 2000).\nMeasuring the native1 volatile composition of comets tests dynamical models for the\nearly solar system (B\u00f6hnhardt et al. 2008, Kobayashi et al. 2007, Mumma et al. 2005).\nStudies of comets are also important for assessing the possibility of exogenous delivery\nof water and pre-biotic organics to early Earth as a hypothesized precursor event(s)\nleading to development of the biosphere (Delsemme 1998, 2000).\nSpectroscopy has revealed a number of molecules released from comet nuclei and a\nsignificant diversity in the relative abundances (or \"mixing ratios\") among them (see\nDiSanti & Mumma 2008; Crovisier 2006; Dello Russo et al. 2008; Magee-Sauer et al.\n2008; Biver et al. 2002; Mumma et al. 2001). This chemical diversity has yet to be\nfully explored, because the sample of observed comets is fairly small, especially at\ninfrared (IR) wavelengths where molecules with no permanent dipole moment (CH4,\nC2H2, C2H6) can be uniquely sensed.\nMoreover, in addition to mixing ratios (e.g., CH4/H2O, HCN/H2O,\nCO/H2CO/CH3OH, etc.), other (possible) cosmogonic signatures such as isotopic (D/H,\n15\n\nN/14N) and nuclear-isomeric (ortho-para, A:E:F, etc.) ratios in particular species are of\n\nkeen interest in cometary science. With few exceptions the knowledge of these\n1\n\n\"Parent\" molecules are those released directly from ices stored in the nucleus\n(\"native\" ices).\n3\n\n\fimportant \"observables\" is very limited (see the reviews of Charnley & Rodgers 2008a;\nCrovisier 2006). In the case of methane (of particular interest in this work), an upper\nlimit for CH3D/CH4 equal to 0.04 (95% confidence limit) was found in comet C/2004\nQ4 (NEAT) (Kawakita et al. 2005), based on a single spectral line. The same work also\nreported a spin temperature for CH4 (T spin ~ 33 K, corresponding to the A:E:F nuclear\nisomeric ratio). Measurements of both deuterium enrichment and spin temperatures of\nvarious species in many more comets are critical for testing possible variations among\nthe comet population. The inter-relation of such measurements with other plausible\ncosmogonic indicators (mixing ratios of parent volatiles, properties of cometary dust)\nwill (likely) clarify the origin of cometary material.\nThis paper summarizes the results from our comprehensive study of parent volatiles\nin comet C/2004 Q2 (Machholz)2, observed with the Near InfraRed echelle\nSPECtrograph (NIRSPEC) (McLean et al. 1998) at the W. M. Keck Observatory atop\nMauna Kea, Hawaii. We detected a number of parent volatiles and we conducted a\nsensitive search for CH3D. We highlight three principal results:\n1.\n\nAn upper limit for the deuterium enrichment of methane (CH3D/CH4).\n\n2.\n\nAn lower bound for the spin temperature of methane.\n\n3.\n\nMixing ratios of CH4, C2H2, C2H6, H2CO, CH3OH, HCN, and NH3 relative\nto H2O, measured (or stringently constrained) at heliocentric distances of\n1.49 AU and 1.21 AU. Mixing ratio CO/H2O measured at 1.48 AU.\n\nIn \u00a72, we describe our observations of comet Q2/Machholz. In \u00a73 we compare the\nmixing ratios of several parent volatiles with respect to H2O, measured at heliocentric\ndistances of 1.49 AU (Nov. 2004) and 1.21 AU (Jan. 2005). In \u00a74 we discuss our\ndetection of CH4 and simultaneous search for CH3D. In \u00a75 we estimate the CH4 spin\ntemperature, followed by discussion of results (\u00a76).\n\n2\n\nHereafter Q2/Machholz or C/2004 Q2\n4\n\n\f2.\n\nOBSERVATION OF C/2004 Q2 (MACHHOLZ) WITH NIRSPEC AT KECK 2\nComet C/2004 Q2 (Machholz) was discovered on August 27, 2004 (Machholz et al.\n\n2004) and reached naked-eye brightness (V < 4m) by January 2005. Q2/Machholz\nbelongs to the dynamical class of \"nearly isotropic comets\", whose dynamical reservoir\nin the present-day Solar system is most likely the Oort cloud (Levison 1996). It has a\nhighly eccentric (e > 0.999) orbit. As a result of the comet's passage in the inner solar\nsystem, the 1/a orbital parameter changed from 0.000408 to 0.0004433. The comet's\nclosest approach to Earth (geocentric distance \u0394 = 0.35 AU) occurred on Jan. 5, 2005,\nand its perihelion was on Jan. 24, 2004 at heliocentric distance R h = 1.205 AU (see\nNakano 2006 and the JPL Small Body database [http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/]).\nVia different methodologies three optical studies revealed the following rotation\nperiods (P) for the nucleus of C/2004 Q2. Farnham et al. (2007) reported P = 17.60 \u00b1\n0.05 h based on CN coma morphology. Sastri et al. (2005) reported P = 9.1 \u00b1 1.9 h\nbased on modeling dust fans visible in R-band images. Reyniers et al. (2009) reported\nP = 9.1 \u00b1 0.2 h based on light curve analysis of optical broadband images. The latter\nstudy considers the possibility that their method has sampled one half instead of the full\nperiod.\nWe observed Q2/Machholz with NIRSPEC at the Keck-2 telescope on November\n28-29, 2004 and on January 19, 2005 (UT dates). Table 1 shows condensed observing\nlogs and derived water production rates. During the first observing run we quantified\nthe production rates and relative abundances of several species commonly observed at\nIR wavelengths, including H2O, CH4, HCN, C2H6, CH3OH, CO, and H2CO. The\nobserving circumstances were exceptionally favorable in January, allowing (in addition\nto measuring the overall volatile composition) detections of weaker species (acetylene,\nammonia) and a sensitive search for mono-deuterated methane.\nWe nodded the telescope along the 24\" long slit in an A1B1B2A2 sequence with 12\"\nbeam separation. The operation (A1 \u2013 B1 \u2013 B2 + A2) provided cancellation (to second\norder in air mass) of thermal background emission and of \"sky\" line emission from the\nEarth's atmosphere. A slit width of 0.43\" resulted in spectral resolving power \u03bb/\u03b4\u03bb \u2248\n25,000.\n5\n\n\fThe cross-dispersed capability of NIRSPEC permitted sampling of all targeted\nmolecules using two instrument settings in the L-band (2.9 \u2013 4.0 \u03bcm) and one in the Mband (4.4 \u2013 5.5 \u03bcm). The \"KL1\" setting samples (simultaneously) H2O, C2H6, and\nCH3OH; \"KL2\" samples H2O, HCN, NH3, C2H2, C2H6, CH4, CH3D and H2CO; and\n\"MWA\" samples H2O and CO. The ability to always simultaneously measure water\nwithin the same grading setting is significant. As the dominant parent volatile H2O\nserves as the natural \"baseline\" with which the abundances of all other species are\ncompared. Simultaneous sampling of H2O and other species eliminates most sources of\nsystematic error that otherwise would affect the resulting mixing ratios (CH4/H2O,\nHCN/H2O, etc.).\nData reduction, flux calibration (based on observations of a standard star), and\nspectral extraction were achieved using custom-designed algorithms developed\nspecifically for our comet observations. These algorithms are described in multiple\nsources, including DiSanti et al. (2006), Villanueva et al. (2009) and references therein.\nBonev (2005; Appendix 2) reviews in detail all important steps leading from data\nacquisition to flux calibrated spectra of C/2004 Q2. Wavelength calibration is\naccomplished by comparing the sky radiance with spectra synthesized using a rigorous\nline-by-line radiative transfer model of the terrestrial atmosphere (GENLN2; Edwards\n1992). This model was recently updated to properly include pressure-shift coefficients\nand the latest spectroscopic parameters (Villanueva et al. 2008; Hewagama et al. 2003).\nFlux-calibrated spectra of C/2004 Q2 obtained on Nov. 28-29, 2004 and on Jan. 19,\n2005 are shown in Figure 13. The January spectra are of especially high quality\nallowing detection of C2H2 and NH3.\n3.\n\nORGANIC VOLATILE COMPOSITION\nProduction rates (Q, molecules s-1) were obtained by comparing the measured line\n\nfluxes to predicted fluorescence efficiencies (g-factors) for the appropriate rotational\ntemperature (T rot).\n3\n\nThe g-factors are based on quantum-mechanical fluorescence\n\nSelected flux-calibrated spectra in ascii format can be requested from the authors. All\nflux calibrated spectra will be made available after the on-going investigations on\nQ2/Machholz that are not included in this work are complete.\n6\n\n\fmodels for H2O (Dello Russo et al. 2004, 2005), C2H6 (Dello Russo et al. 2001), CH4\n(Gibb et al. 2003), CH3OH (Reuter et al. 1992; DiSanti et al. 2002), H2CO (DiSanti et\nal. 2006; Reuter et al. 1989), CO (DiSanti et al. 2001), HCN (Magee-Sauer et al.\n1999a), C2H2 (Magee-Sauer et al. 2002), and NH3 (Magee-Sauer at al. 2008).\nMultiple lines are used to obtain most production rates and the level of\ndisagreement between line-by-line production rates is included in the uncertainty. The\nexceptions are CH3OH and H2CO whose production rates are based on the integrated\nintensity of the detected Q-branches.\nThe production rate of ammonia deserves a special discussion because of possible\nspectral \"contamination\" from other species. First, we find no evidence that the\nemission near 3295 cm-1 labeled NH3 (Fig. 1g) is contaminated by NH2. Both the\nmeasured frequency (3295.4 cm-1) and the line width of this spectral feature are entirely\nconsistent with this emission originating from two blended ammonia lines [aqP(2,0)\nand aqP(2,1); \u03bd1 band]. On the other hand, the NH2 (\u03bd3 band) emission should peak at\n3295.5 cm-1. Second, the contribution of HCN to the emission near 3317 cm-1 is\nnegligible (nevertheless the HCN contribution was modeled out before quantitative\nanalysis of NH3). This weak feature is primarily due to ammonia [sqP(1,0)]. We note\nthat definitive searches for NH2 and detection of NH3 via larger number of (stronger)\nlines requires higher spectral resolving power and broader spectral coverage.\nDetailed descriptions of the methodology for obtaining rotational temperatures,\nproduction rates, and mixing ratios (or their upper limits) are given elsewhere\n(Villanueva et al. 2009; DiSanti et al. 2006; Bonev et al. 2006, 2007; Dello Russo et al.\n2004). Production rates, rotational temperatures, and mixing ratios (relative to H2O)\nare summarized in Tables 2a and 2b. The observed transitions of H2O, HCN, and CO\nsample quantum levels with a range of rotational energies sufficiently broad to\nconstrain the temperature. We adopted the measured temperatures for water for all\nother species. Noting that T rot(HCN) and Trot(H2O) differ significantly in January, we\nverified that the mixing ratio of HCN is only weakly influenced by this difference. We\nsample enough lines of HCN so the resulting production rate is relatively insensitive to\nmoderate (within 15-20 K) changes in rotational temperature. As a result, the relative\n7\n\n\fabundance HCN/H2O is nearly the same whether we assume T rot(HCN) = 76 K or\nTrot(HCN) = 93 K (Table 2a).\nOur water production rate derived for Jan. 19, 2005 agrees within error with the\nOdin satellite submillimeter measurement (Jan. 20, 2005) \u2013 Biver et al. (2007) report\nQ(H2O) = (26.4 \u00b1 0.8) x 1028 s-1. Most importantly, the agreement of our mixing ratios\nmeasured at R h = 1.49 AU and 1.21 AU (Fig. 3) is consistent with chemical\nhomogeneity in \"mean volatile release\" from the nucleus of C/2004 Q2 (see discussion\nin \u00a76.2).\n4.\n\nAN UPPER LIMIT FOR CH3D/CH4 IN COMET C/2004 Q2 (MACHHOLZ)\nFigure 2 shows our detection of CH4 and simultaneous search for CH3D in C/2004\n\nQ2. A production rate for methane is derived from the KL2 setting based on the R0,\nR1, and R2 lines, and from the KL1 setting, based on the P2 line (see Fig. 1a). The\nCH4 production rates are obtained independently for each NIRSPEC setting and agree\nwithin error (Table 3).\nIn our search for CH3D, we apply the following criterion for molecular detection:\n(1)\n\nMore than one emission line of the searched molecule must be detected.\n\n(2)\n\nThe abundances of the searched volatile, derived independently from each\ndetected line must be in reasonable agreement.\n\nA CH3D fluorescence model (accounting for terrestrial atmospheric transmittance)\nis shown on Figure 2. This model is adopted from Kawakita & Watanabe (2003). We\nnotice an emission feature close in frequency to the CH3D transition (RR(0,0)) near\n3025 cm-1. If we assume that this emission belongs to CH3D, we obtain CH3D/CH4 =\n0.3 for the abundance of mono-deuterated methane. However, this value is inconsistent\nwith the non-detections of other sampled transitions (see model Fig. 2), and therefore\nviolates both detection criteria (1) and (2). For such a high abundance, the strong\nCH3D line (RR(3,3)) near 3054 cm-1 is predicted to be of comparable intensity with the\nlines from the OH \"quadruplet\" between 3047 and 3043 cm-1 (as shown on the figure).\nInstead, the non-detection of this line implies that CH3D/CH4 < 0.027 (3\u03c3 limit).\nAlthough we detect a spectral feature at the frequency of one searched CH3D line, we\n8\n\n\fcannot claim detection of this molecule, because other emissions that are predicted to\nbe substantially stronger are not identified.\nThree factors affect the sensitivity of the resulting upper limit for mono-deuterated\nmethane. First is the photon noise near the expected positions of CH3D lines. This\nnoise is dominated by thermal background emission and by the \"sky\" line emission\nfrom the terrestrial atmosphere (e.g., Fig. 1 of Bonev et al. 2006). The second factor is\npossible frequency overlap by emission from species other than CH3D in the spectrallycrowded region near 3.3 \u03bcm. Using only transitions without identified blends with\nemission from other species (these are marked with \"X\" in Fig. 2), we obtained a 3\u03c3\nupper limit of CH3D/CH4 < 0.020 (Table 3), corresponding to D/H (methane) < 0.0054.\nThe third factor affecting the reported upper limit is the adopted rotational\ntemperature for CH3D. We assumed the same Trot (93 K) for both CH4 and CH3D,\nequal to that measured for H2O (Table 2a). This represents the more conservative\nchoice for deriving an upper limit \u2013 assuming lower rotational temperature for CH3D\nwould result in a smaller (more stringent) upper limit for CH3D/CH4, because the gfactors of the sampled strong CH3D lines increase with decreasing Trot (see Kawakita &\nWatanabe 2003).\nKawakita & Kobayashi (2009) published a completely independent investigation\nfocusing on the spin temperatures of water and methane in Q2/Maccholz and on CH3D.\nThey observed the comet on Jan. 30, 2005 with NIRSPEC and accumulated 36 minutes\non source (vs. 8 minutes in our study). Based on a tentative detection of the RR(3,3)\nline, this work reports D/H = 0.0038 \u00b1 0.0013 (CH3D/CH4 = 0.0152 \u00b1 0.0052). These\nauthors point out that the detected emission might be attributed to another species (e.g.\nCH3OH), in which case they conclude that on the 95% confidence level D/H < 0.0064\n(CH3D/CH4 < 0.025). These results are in good agreement with our retrieval, thereby\nincreasing the reliability of D/H measured for methane in C/2004 Q2.\nFinally, our 3\u03c3 upper limit for CH3D/CH4 (0.020) agrees with the measurement in\nanother Oort cloud Comet - C/2001 Q2 (NEAT) - reported by Kawakita et al. (2005)\n(CH3D/CH4 < 0.04, 95% confidence limit).\n4\n\nD/H(methane) = 0.25 x CH3D/CH4.\n9\n\n\f5.\n\nS PIN T EMPERATURE\n\nOF\n\nM ETHANE\n\nIN\n\nC/2004 Q2: CONSTRAINTS\n\nAND\n\nUNCERTAINTIES.\nIn this section we describe the constraints on the spin temperature of CH4 that can\nbe imposed by the C/2004 Q2 measured spectra. The CH4 molecule exists in three\ntypes of nuclear spin species (A, E, and F; see Barnes et al. 1972). The temperature\nthat reproduces a given A:E:F abundance ratio under conditions of thermal equilibrium\nis defined as the methane spin temperature (Kawakita et al. 2005, Gibb et al. 2003).\nThis parameter should be distinguished from the rotational temperature defined as the\nBoltzmann temperature that describes the rotational population distribution within the\nground vibrational level for a given spin \"ladder\". Radiative and collisional transitions\namong levels from different spin states are strongly forbidden.\n5.1\n\nThe R0/R1 line ratio as a spin temperature diagnostic\nThe R0 and R1 lines (\u03bd 3 band) of CH4 represent pure A and F transitions\n\nrespectively (A2 \u2013 A1 and F2 \u2013 F1; see Gibb et al. 2003 or Drapatz et al. 1987), and their\nflux ratio is sensitive to Tspin. The abundance ratio F/A increases with spin temperature\nuntil reaching the statistical equilibrium value of 9:5 at Tspin \u2248 45 K (see for example\nFig. 4 in Gibb et al. 2003). The strong R0 and R1 lines are detected simultaneously\n(Fig. 2). Their flux ratio was determined with good precision and compared to the\npredicted flux ratios, that depend on both spin and rotational temperature (Gibb et al.\n2003). We tested a range of spin temperatures, and (initially) adopted the rotational\ntemperatures found for water measured simultaneously (Table 2a). Measured and\npredicted line ratios are summarized in Table 4.\nWe found that the R0/R1 line ratio was consistent with spin temperatures higher\nthan 35 K for both dates (Nov. 28, 2004 and Jan. 19, 2005). Our January observations\nrule out Tspin below 38 K at the 99% confidence limit imposed by the 3\u03c3 stochastic\nnoise uncertainty (\u224812%) in the measured line ratio. For November, the observed line\nratio differs from the statistical equilibrium value by only 1.1\u03c3 (the 3\u03c3 stochastic noise\nlimit is Tspin > 35 K). This result is consistent with the independently derived value by\n10\n\n\fKawakita & Kobayashi (2009), who report Tspin(CH4) > 36 K at the 95% confidence\nlimit, based on \u03c72 retrieval.\nWe verified that the assumed rotational temperature for methane does not impact\nour conclusion for Tspin > ~35 K. This conclusion holds for a wide range of T rot as\nshown on Table 4 and Fig. 4. Assuming a rotational temperature substantially lower\nthan that found for H2O reduces the agreement between observed and predicted line\nratios for any value of the spin temperature. However, the predicted line ratio (R0/R1)\nfor statistical equilibrium still provides the best match to the measurement. Assuming\nrotational temperatures higher than measured for water strongly favors Tspin > ~35 K.\nWe also verified the R0/R1 ratio (and respectively T spin) is insignificantly affected\nby variation in the telluric transmittance function. The reason is that a change in the\ntelluric transmittance produces correlated change in the derived top-of-the-atmosphere\nfluxes of the two methane lines, so their relative intensities are only weakly affected.\nFinally, similar lower limits for Tspin are found at both blue (Nov. 28, 2004) and red\n(Jan. 19, 2005) Doppler shifts also in favor of the measurement's reliability.\n5.2\n\nLimitations of the spin temperature retrieval.\nThe main limitation of the derived spin temperature are: (1) it is based on a single\n\nline of each spin species sampled (A and F for R0 and R1 respectively), and (2) a\ncommon adopted rotational temperature is assigned to each spin ladder. Most CH4\nlines are severely extinguished by telluric absorption at the Doppler shifts of our\nobservations (given in Table 1). As a result only R0 and R1 are detected with high\nsignal-to-noise, required for a sensitive Tspin measurement.\nEven if the Doppler shift was sufficient to obtain high signal-to-noise for a large\nnumber of methane lines, emissions other than R0 and R1 contain lines representing\ntransitions from different spin ladders (Gibb et al. 2003) that remain blended at the\nspectral resolving power of NIRSPEC. In practice, it is more difficult to derive unique\nvalues for Trot(CH4) and Tspin(CH4) from such blended transitions. Robust determination\nof Trot(CH4) and T spin(CH4) requires detections of multiple lines of spectrally-resolved\nA-, F-, and E-type transitions that sample quantum states having a broad range of\n11\n\n\frotational energies. This would allow testing whether the rotational population\ndistributions within a given spin ladder can be characterized by a single rotational\ntemperature and whether the T rot measured independently for the three spin ladders\nagree. Only then can Tspin be determined more reliably.\nOur retrieval does not allow a robust line-by-line test of the CH4 fluorescence\nmodel at hand, similarly to the way it has been done for H2O (e.g. Dello Russo et al.\n2004; Bonev et al. 2007). For this reason the reported error in T spin(CH4) does not\ninclude a potential model-related uncertainty.\nWe defer more detailed discussion on problems related to CH4 spin temperature\nanalysis in comets to a separate paper (Gibb, E. L. et al. 2009, in preparation).\nAlthough potentially less robust, the value derived here for Tspin(CH4) is in very good\nagreement with the result derived for H2O in C/2004 Q2. Bonev et al. (2007) report\nTspin(H2O) > 34 K (this limit is dominated by the systematic uncertainty in line-by-line\nanalysis which exceeds the uncertainty due to photon noise), while Kawakita &\nKobayashi (2009) report T spin(H2O) > 27 K (95 % confidence limit, based on \u03c72\nretrieval).\n6.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n6.1\n\nComparison with organic volatile abundances measured in other comets.\nThe abundances of C2H6, CH3OH, and HCN relative to H2O in C/2004 Q2 are\n\nsimilar to those observed in several Oort cloud comets, tentatively referred to as\n\"organics-normal\" (see Mumma et al. 2008, DiSanti & Mumma 2008, Mumma et al.\n2003). The abundance of native H2CO is at the lower end of the range observed in Oort\ncloud comets (~0.1% \u2013 ~0.8%).\nThe mixing ratios CO/H2O and CH4/H2O were found to vary by an order of\nmagnitude (or more in the case of CO) among comets (Mumma et al. 2003; Gibb et al.\n2003, 2007b).\n\nHowever, there is no correlation is between the CO and CH4\n\nabundances. This notion is supported by our observations of Q2/Maccholz where the\nmixing ratio CO/H2O (\u22485 %) is intermediate in comparison with other comets\n\n12\n\n\f(abundances vary between < 0.1% to ~15%), while CH4/H2O (~1.45%) is near the high\nend of the observed range (< ~0.1% \u2013 ~2.0 %).\nInterestingly, acetylene is low in abundance relative to both water and ethane. The\nC2H6/C2H2 ratio (~5) in Q2/Machholz is substantially larger than observed in other\ncomets. The relative abundance CH4/HCN (~10) is also distinctly larger than in\nprevious comets observed (~2.5 to ~5.5).\nMore detailed inter-comparison among comets observed in the IR (including\nC/2004 Q2) will be presented in a future review dedicated to the emerging taxonomic\nclassification of comets based on parent volatile composition (see Mumma et al. 2008\nfor preliminary results). Here, we focus our discussion on two particular topics:\nevidence for compositional homogeneity in Q2/Machholz (\u00a76.2), and cosmogonic\nimplications of our measured CH3D/CH4 upper limit (\u00a76.3-6.5).\n6.2\n\nCompositional homogeneity of mean volatile release of C/2004 Q2\nInfrared measurements of parent volatiles are rarely obtained over a large range of\n\nheliocentric distances for a given comet (see \u00a73), owing to the difficulty in scheduling\nadequate observing time.\n\nComets 1P/Halley and C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) are\n\nexceptions. Both featured sufficient advance notice to permit planned campaigns. For\nHalley, water was studied from 1.16 AU (pre-perihelion), through perihelion (0.58\nAU), and out again to 1.10 AU (post-perihelion). The ortho-para ratio of water\nremained unchanged over that interval (Mumma et al. 1993).\nIn Hale-Bopp, CO and C2H6 were measured from respectively 4.1 AU and 3.01 AU\npre-perihelion, through perihelion (0.91 AU), and out again to 2.83 AU post-perihelion\n(DiSanti et al. 2001, Dello Russo et al. 2001). The specific mass loss over this period\n(kg/sec * Rh2, with Rh in AU) was discussed and compared with similar measures of\ndust and other parent volatiles (Mumma et al. 2003). For comparison, in the radio\nBiver et al. (1999) studied extensively the long-term evolution of outgassing in HaleBopp between 7.0 AU (pre-perihelion) to 4.0 AU (post-perihelion). These authors\ninvestigated the evolution of production rates and relative abundances of a number of\n\n13\n\n\fspecies, founding that the latter did not exhibit substantial changes at R h < 1.5 AU.\nSuch studies address (at least) two important questions:\n1.\n\nIs the comet nucleus compositionally homogeneous (or heterogeneous) on a\nbulk scale?\n\n2.\n\nAre the observed chemical abundances of comet volatiles affected by\nheliocentric evolution of outgassing?\n\nSeveral other comets were sampled at IR wavelengths at diverse heliocentric\ndistances. In Comet C/2001 A2 (LINEAR), the H2CO/H2O ratio varied day-to-day by a\nfactor of four at 1.16 AU (while the comet was in outburst), while the CH4/H2O ratio\nincreased by a factor of two as the comet moved from ~1.16 AU and 1.55 AU (Gibb et\nal. 2007b). In 9P/Tempel-1, \"Deep Impact\" returned evidence of dissimilar CO2/H2O\nratios in individual vents (Feaga et al. 2007). Such variability might be attributed to\ninternal heterogeneity in volatile composition caused by radial dynamical mixing of\ncometesimals prior to forming a cometary nucleus.\nBy contrast, Comet 8P/Tuttle was observed over a range of heliocentric distances\n(1.16 \u2013 1.08 AU, spanning 38 days) during its favorable 2007-2008 apparition and very\nsimilar relative abundances resulted from all IR observations (Bonev et al. 2008,\nB\u00f6hnhardt et al. 2008), consistent with homogeneous volatile composition.\nThe split comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 (73P/SW3) provided the strongest\nevidence for compositional homogeneity. The mixing ratios of multiple parent\nvolatiles measured in fragments B and C were remarkably similar (heliocentric\ndistances 1.06 to 0.99 AU, Dello Russo et al. 2007). The mixing ratios C2H6/H2O and\nHCN/H2O measured independently in fragment C (Villanueva et al. 2006, based on\nmeasurements at heliocentric distances 1.27 and 1.19 AU) and in fragment B\n(heliocentric distance 1.03 AU, Kobayashi et al. 2007) agree with one another and with\nthose reported by Dello Russo et al. thereby increasing the evidence for compositional\nhomogeneity of the parent body on bulk scales.\nThe mixing ratios of parent volatiles in C/2004 Q2 measured at heliocentric\ndistance of 1.5 AU agree with those measured at 1.2 AU (Figure 3), although separated\nin time by nearly two months. During this interval the comet's gas productivity\n14\n\n\fincreased by a factor of about 2 (Tables 1, 2), while the abundances relative to H2O\nremained (nearly) unchanged. The similarity in relative abundances measured at 1.5\nAU and 1.2 AU contrasts strongly with the degree of chemical diversity observed\namong Oort cloud comets (see \u00a71).\nOur results support chemical homogeneity in the mean volatile release from C/2004\nQ2, but do not exclude the possibility that the nucleus has more than one active region\n(perhaps many) as suggested by studies of daughter fragments (Farnham et al. 2007;\nLin et al. 2007). Even if different active regions are characterized by distinct mixing\nratios among volatiles, the \"mean\" release exhibits nearly identical chemistry\nsuggesting that roughly the same proportions of release are maintained.\n\nSuch\n\ncompositional similarities for a given comet strongly suggest that the heliocentric\nevolution of outgassing [whether gradual (e.g., 8P/Tuttle and Q2/Machholz) or abrupt\n(from outburst or splitting as in 73P/SW3)] has not affected the observed abundances.\nThe most plausible hypothesis is that these abundances are representative of the bulk\nvolatile composition and reflect the early history of cometary ices.\n6.3\n\nThe D/H ratio in methane as a cosmogonic \"thermometer\"\nSearches for deuterated species are a key part in testing the \"interstellar-comet\n\nconnection\" (Charnley and Rodgers 2008a,b). In particular:\n1.\n\nWhat is the processing history experienced by interstellar organic matter as it\nis incorporated into the disk of a (low mass) protostar?\n\n2.\n\nHow (and to what extent) is the deuterium fraction modified (with respect\ninsterstellar values) prior to incorporation of ices in cometary nuclei?\n\n3.\n\nDoes \"unprocessed\" (without change in isotopic signatures) interstellar\nvolatile material exist in comets?\n\nModels that incorporate gas phase chemistry and trace the evolution of D/H from\ncold (10 K) molecular cloud, through core collapse, to formation of proto-planetary\ndisk predict CH3D/CH4 \u2265 0.10 (Aikawa & Herbst 1999, 2001; see also the nice\ndiscussion in Kawakita et al. 2005). On the other hand, our measured upper limit\n(CH3D/CH4 < 0.02, 3\u03c3) agrees with predictions for methane formation via ion-molecule\n15\n\n\freactions in relatively warm (> 25-30 K) gas (Millar et al. 1989; Charnley and Rodgers\n2008a). Models of gradients in temperature and composition in proto-stellar cloud\ncores indeed predict low D/H for these outer regions \u2013 thought to be the main source\nfor material in the disk at the time when comets form (Charnley & Rodgers 2008b)5.\nThus the measured upper limit for CH3D/CH4 is consistent with, but (quite possibly)\ndoes not unambiguously imply formation of cometary methane exclusively via gas\nphase chemistry at temperatures exceeding 25-30 K.\nAn important question is whether our measurement can also be explained within the\ninterpretation of Boogert et al. (2004) who detected both gas phase and solid phase CH4\nalong the line of sight of the massive protostar NGC 7838 IRC 9 and suggested that\nmethane is formed by H-atom addition reactions on grain surfaces and is intimately\nmixed with water in the proto-stellar envelope.\nGas-grain chemistry and the effects of three desorption mechanisms (thermal-,\nphoto-, and cosmic ray induced desorption) were incorporated by Willacy (2007) who\nmodeled the chemical evolution in a static (i.e. w/o mixing processes, see \u00a76.4) T-Tauri\ndisk formed after the collapse of a molecular cloud. This model predicts CH3D/CH4\nratios in the range ~0.07 - 0.20. The inconsistency with our upper limit might be\nrelated to the initial condition (CH3D/CH4 \u2248 0.07), resulting from methane formation in\nmolecular cloud of temperature equal to 10 K.\nThese comparisons with chemical models suggest that the methane ice released\nfrom the nucleus of Q2/Machholz is not dominated by a component that keeps a\nchemical \"memory\" of cold (<< 25 K) environments in the natal cloud or in the outer\nregions of the protoplanetary disk (where similar chemistry can occur despite higher\ndensities, see Aikawa & Herbst 2001). The (D/H)H2O ratio (< 2.3 x 10-4, preliminary\nresult) in C/2004 Q2 (Biver et al. 2005) supports a similar conclusion for water. The\nspin temperatures of H2O (> 34 K, Bonev et al. 2007) and CH4 (> 35-38 K, this work)\nin C/2004 Q2 also support a relatively warm formation environment, providing Tspin is\n\n5\n\nIn the same model, the region characterized by highest D/H ratios is in the center of\nthe pre-stellar cloud. Most of this material would likely be absorbed by the forming\nproto-star.\n16\n\n\findeed a measure of the chemical formation temperature of the corresponding\nmolecule.\nThese conclusions are tentative because the current models for evolution of\ndeuterium enrichments in comet volatiles are still under development. One of the\nprincipal challenges is to investigate the possibility for nebular (vs. interstellar) origin\nof volatile matter incorporated into comet nuclei.\n6.4\n\nThe possibility for synthesis of hydrocarbons in the inner protoplanetary disk\nand outward radial transport of matter\nAn alternative pathway that can explain our CH3D/CH4 upper limit involves\n\nhydrocarbons that formed in the inner nebula. Based on laboratory simulations, Nuth et\nal. (2000) predicted that hydrogenated species can be synthesized along with crystalline\ndust in the hot environments of the inner solar nebula. Recent laboratory work (Nuth et\nal. 2008) demonstrated that an organics-rich macromolecular coating forms on various\ngrain surfaces via reactions that reduce CO to produce hydrocarbons. In this process\nmolecules, like CH4 and C2H6 are released in the gas phase, while forming layers of\ncarbon-rich macromolecular residue further providing a catalytic surface for continuing\nefficient synthesis of organic material. A similar process could produce hydrocarbons\nefficiently in the hot inner proto-planetary disk.\nOutward radial transport of matter could bring these products of high-temperature\nchemistry to environments where ices can form. Several models (Dubrille 1993,\nDrouart et al. 1999, Shu et al. 2001, Bockelee-Morvan et al. 2002, Gail 2002) explored\nmechanisms for radial mixing in the nebula, and predicted \"grand-scale\" transport of\ndust and gas within the nebular disk allowing high-temperature chemical products to be\nultimately incorporated into comet nuclei. These predictions were resoundingly\nconfirmed by analysis of refractory minerals in 81P/Wild 2 returned by the \"Stardust\"\nmission (Brownlee et al. 2006, Zolensky et al. 2006).\nWe expect that material synthesized in the hot inner nebula would be characterized\nby the protosolar value of D/H. Our observed upper limit for CH3D/CH4 corresponds to\n\n17\n\n\fD/H (< 5 x 10-3, 3\u03c3) exceeding the protosolar value ([2.35 \u00b1 0.3] x 10-5)6 by two orders\nof magnitude. Therefore our result does not rule out the hypothesis that (some)\nmethane (and other organics) in C/2004 Q2 was synthesized in the hot inner nebula.\nUnder this scenario, the amount of inner-nebula organics stored in comet nuclei would\nbe controlled by:\n1.\n\nthe time-dependent abundances of various hydrocarbons resulting from innernebula chemistry,\n\n2.\n\nthe efficiency and distance scale (neither are well-understood at present) of\noutward radial transport in the protoplanetary disk at a particular time, and\n\n3.\n\nthe conditions in outer ice-forming regions, where comet nuclei could accrete.\n\nSince crystalline dust is also produced in the inner nebula (see review of Wooden\n2008), the ratio of crystalline-to-total dust content in C/2004 Q2 would provide an\nadditional constraint on the hypothesis of nebular origin for a fraction of organic\nmaterial stored in the nucleus of this comet (Drouart et al. 1999). A high fraction of\ncrystalline dust is predicted to correlate with low CO-to-hydrocarbons (e.g CO/C2H6)\nand N2/NH3 ratios (Nuth et al. 2000).\n6.5\n\nSummary on constraints from CH3D/CH4\nOur upper limit for CH3D/CH4 (< 0.020, 3\u03c3) implies that methane ice released from\n\nthe nucleus of Q2/Machholz is not dominated by an unprocessed component formed in\nextremely cold (~10 K) environments either in the inner portions of the proto-solar\nmolecular cloud or (at a later evolutionary stage) in the outer regions of the\nprotoplanetary disk. We discussed three formation pathways for methane stored in the\nnucleus of Q2/Machholz:\n1.\n\nFormation of methane in a relatively warm (> 25 K) gas via ion-molecule\nchemistry (consistent with the observed CH3D/CH4 upper limit).\n\n2.\n\nFormation of methane simultaneously with H2O via H-atom addition reactions\non interstellar icy grains in the proto-solar envelope.\n\n6\n\nWeighted mean of the values reported by Geiss & Gloeckler 1998, Mahaffy et al.\n1998, and Lellouch et al. 2001; see Mousis et al. 2002.\n18\n\n\f3.\n\nSynthesis of methane and other hydrocarbons in the hot inner solar nebular,\nfollowed by outward radial transport of matter (characterized by proto-solar\nD/H) to environments where comet nuclei can form.\n\nEvaluating the relative contributions of these pathways and the extent to which each\npathway is consistent with both the measured upper limit for CH3D/CH4 and the\nobserved volatile abundances relative to H2O requires further modeling of chemistry\nincluding both gas-phase and gas-grain processes in the natal interstellar cloud, during\ncore collapse, and in the protoplanetary disk.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to Neil Dello Russo for his thorough reviews that improved the\nquality of the paper.

The black dashed lines\nenvelope the photon noise (\u00b1 1\u03c3). Detections of C2H6 (a-b), H2O (c-d), CH3OH (e-f),\nHCN (g-h), CO (i), H2CO (j-k), and CH4 (l) are highlighted. The Q-branch of the\nCH3OH \u03bd3 band (panels e-f) is commonly used to measure methanol production rates in\ncomets from infrared observations. Acetylene (\u03bd3 band) and ammonia (\u03bd1 band) are\ndetected on Jan. 19, 2005 (panel g). C2H2 (\u03bd2 + \u03bd4 + \u03bd5 band) has a line at the\nfrequency of the emission feature near 3295.8 cm-1. However claiming detection\nrequires developing a fluorescence model and testing it against multiple lines, so this\nfeature is not used to derive a production rate for acetylene. The emission near 3302\ncm-1 might be a signature of NH2 (\u03bd1 band). However, C2H2 (R2, \u03bd3 band) contributes\nsubstantially to the detected emission, which complicates quantitative analysis.\nFIG.2. \u2013 Detection of CH4 and search for CH3D in C/2004 Q2 on 19 Jan. 2005. The\nlines in the model marked with \"x\" are excluded from quantitative analysis because of\npossible spectral contamination by emissions from other species (see text for detailed\ndiscussion). The black dashed lines envelope the photon noise (\u00b1 1\u03c3).\n\nFIG.3. \u2013 Mixing ratios (relative to H2O) measured in C/2004 Q2 (Machholz). All\nparent molecules except CO were measured both in November 2004 (Rh = 1.49 AU)\nand January 2005 (Rh = 1.21 AU). See discussion in \u00a76.1 and \u00a76.2.\nFIG.4. \u2013 Dependence of the methane R0/R1 flux ratio (CH4, \u03bd 3 band) on rotational\nand spin temperatures. Theoretical curves (following Gibb et al. 2003) for Tspin = 30 K,\nTspin = 38 K, and Tspin > ~ 50 K (statistical equilibrium) are shown. The measured flux\nratios (R0/R1)meas for Nov. 28, 2004 and Jan. 19, 2005 and their +3\u03c3 stochastic\nuncertainties are indicated with solid and dashed horizontal lines respectively. This\ngraphic illustrates that the observed CH4 R0/R1 flux ratios are consistent with T spin >\n33\n\n\f35-38 K for a broad range of rotational temperature, including the rotational\ntemperatures derived on those dates for water. See \u00a75.2 for discussion on the possible\nlimitations of the spin temperature retrieval.\n\n34\n\n\fTABLE 1\nOBSERVING LOG AND H2O PRODUCTION RATES\nUT date\n\n\u0394\nNIRSPEC\nRh\ndRh/dt\nd\u0394/dt\nTint\n-1\n-1\nSetting\n[AU] [km s ] [AU] [km s ] [min]\n28 Nov 2004\nKL1\n1.493 \u221215.2 0.654 \u221221.7\n8\n\nQ(H2O)\n(1026 s-1)\n1535 \u00b1 69\n\nKL2\n\n1.493\n\n\u221215.2\n\n0.655\n\n\u221221.8\n\n20\n\n1435 \u00b1 124\n\n29 Nov 2004\n\nMWA\n\n1.484\n\n\u221215.0\n\n0.642\n\n\u221221.5\n\n6\n\n1253 \u00b1 153\n\n19 Jan 2005\n\nKL1\n\n1.208\n\n\u22122.0\n\n0.393\n\n10.9\n\n8\n\n2727 \u00b1 114\n\nKL2\n\n1.208\n\n\u22122.0\n\n0.394\n\n11.0\n\n8\n\n2755 \u00b1 132\n\nN OTE . \u2013 Rh, dR h/dt, \u0394, and d\u0394/dt are respectively heliocentric distance, heliocentric\nradial velocity, geocentric distance, and topocentric line-of-sight velocity of C/2004\nQ2; Tint is total integration time on source, and Q(H2O) is the water production rate, as\ndescribed in \u00a73\n\n35\n\n\fTABLE 2a\nORGANIC VOLATILE COMPOSITION OF COMET C/2004 Q2 (MACHHOLZ)\nNIRSPEC\nSetting\nKL1\n\nKL2\n\nMWA\n\nKL1\n\nKL2\n\na\n\na\nb, c\nMixing Ratio\nTrot\nQ\n[%]\n[K]\n(1026 s-1)\n2004 Nov 28, Rh = 1.493 AU, \u0394 = 0.65 AU\nH2O\n(86)\n1535 \u00b1 55 (69)\n100\nC2H6\n(86)\n8.62 \u00b1 0.35\n0.56 \u00b1 0.03\nCH3OH\n(86)\n31.11 \u00b1 1.21\n2.03 \u00b1 0.11\nCH4\n(86)\n19.21 \u00b1 1.65\n1.25 \u00b1 0.12\nH2O\n86 \u00b1 4\n1435 \u00b1 73 (124)\n100\nHCN\n76 \u00b1 9\n2.02 \u00b1 0.20\n0.14 \u00b1 0.02\nd\nd\nNH3\n(86)\n< 6.81\n< 0.47\nd\nd\nC2H2\n(86)\n< 0.91\n< 0.06\nH2CO\n(86)\n1.45 \u00b1 0.45\n0.10 \u00b1 0.03\nCH4\n(86)\n18.08 \u00b1 0.36\n1.26 \u00b1 0.10\n2004 Nov 29, Rh = 1.484 AU, \u0394 = 0.64 AU\nH2O\n(100)\n1253 \u00b1 112 (153)\n100\n\nParent\nMolecule\n\nCO\n97+18-17\n63.46 \u00b1 2.77\n2005 Jan 19, Rh = 1.208 AU, \u0394 = 0.39 AU\nH2O\n(93)\n2727 \u00b1 70 (114)\nC2H6\n(93)\n14.89 \u00b1 0.85\nCH3OH\n(93)\n61.97 \u00b1 2.12\nCH4\n(93)\n39.05 \u00b1 2.41\nH2O\n93 \u00b1 2\n2755 \u00b1 75 (132)\nHCN\n76 \u00b1 2\n4.12 \u00b1 0.07\nHCN\n(93)\n4.51 \u00b1 0.18\nNH3\n(76)\n8.26 \u00b1 1.20\nNH3\n(93)\n10.22 \u00b1 1.48\nC2H2\n(76)\n2.31 \u00b1 0.12\nC2H2\n(93)\n2.52 \u00b1 0.13\nH2CO\n(93)\n3.38 \u00b1 0.35\nCH4\n(93)\n42.50 \u00b1 1.20\n\n5.07 \u00b1 0.51\n100\n0.55 \u00b1 0.04\n2.27 \u00b1 0.12\n1.43 \u00b1 0.10\n100\n0.15 \u00b1 0.01\n0.16 \u00b1 0.01\n0.30 \u00b1 0.04\n0.37 \u00b1 0.06\n0.08 \u00b1 0.01\n0.09 \u00b1 0.01\n0.12 \u00b1 0.02\n1.54 \u00b1 0.06\n\nRotational temperature.

Slit losses do not affect mixing ratios\namong parent species measured within the same NIRSPEC setting, but should be considered in\ncomparison between H2O production rates measured from different settings and/or on different dates.\nc\nSee also Table 3 and \u00a74 for methane results on 2005 Jan. 19.\nd\n\nUpper limits are 3\u03c3.\n\n36\n\n\fTABLE 2b\nWEIGHTED MEAN MIXING RATIOS FOR SPECIES DETECTED ON BOTH DATES\n(NOV. 28, 2004 AND JAN. 19, 2005)\nVolatile\nHCN\nCH4\nC2H6\nH2CO\nCH3OH\n+0.01\nMixing ratio X/H2O [%] 0.15 -0.02 1.46 \u00b1 0.08 0.56 \u00b1 0.02 0.11 \u00b1 0.03 2.14 \u00b1 0.12\n\n37\n\n\fTABLE 3\nRELATIVE ABUNDANCES OF CH4 AND CH3D IN C/2004 Q2 (MACHHOLZ)\n(JANUARY 19, 2005)\nNIRSPEC\nSetting\n\nIsotope\n\nKL1\nKL2\nKL2\n\nCH4\nCH4\nCH3D\n\nTrot\nQ\n[K]\n(1026 s-1)\n(93)\n39.05 \u00b1 2.41\n(93)\n42.50 \u00b1 1.20\n(93) 0.025 \u00b1 0.284 a\n\nMixing Ratio [%]\nX/CH4\nX/H2O\n100\n1.43 \u00b1 0.10\n100\n1.54 \u00b1 0.06\na\n< 2.0\n\nNOTE. \u2013 Trot and Q are defined as in Table 2a.\na\nThe error in Q(CH3D) (\u03c3Q) exceeds the formal measured value, i.e., CH3D was not detected.
