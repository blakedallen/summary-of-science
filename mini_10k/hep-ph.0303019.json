Box 64, 00014 University of Helsinki, Finland\nWe study the thermodynamics of the electroweak theory at a finite lepton number density. The\nphase diagram of the theory is calculated by relating the full 4-dimensional theory to a 3-dimensional\neffective theory which has been previously solved using nonperturbative methods. It is seen that\nthe critical temperature increases and the value of the Higgs boson mass at which the first order\nphase transition line ends decreases with increasing leptonic chemical potential.\n\narXiv:hep-ph/0303019v3 9 Jul 2003\n\nPACS numbers: 11.10.Wx, 11.15.Ex\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe complete thermodynamic description of the electroweak theory1 depends on only five intensive variables;\nthe temperature T of the system, the strength of the external U(1) magnetic field H Y and the leptonic chemical\npotentials \u03bcLi . The most studied case is that when only\nthe temperature T and the conjugated variable entropy\nare nonzero as it was early understood that at high temperatures the symmetry of the electroweak theory would\nbe restored [1]. Much work was devoted to this problem\nusing, for example, perturbative 1-loop [2, 3, 4] and 2loop [5] effective potential calculations. These only work\nfor small scalar self-couplings or for small Higgs masses\nand the full solution of the problem required first a perturbative matching of the full 4-dimensional theory to\nan effective 3-dimensional theory [6]. The phase diagram\nof the effective theory was then numerically solved with\nlattice Monte Carlo techniques [7] (the phase diagram\nhas been studied numerically also with the 4-dimensional\ntheory, see [8]). The result is that the phase diagram\ncontains a first-order line which ends in a 2nd order critical point of Ising universality class [9]. Similar techniques were then applied to solve the phase diagram when\nalso HY and the conjugate extensive variable V BY were\nnonzero [10]. The purpose of this paper is to study the\nremaining case; how the phase diagram depends on finite\nchemical potentials related to lepton and baryon numbers and on the conjugate extensive variables, net lepton\nand baryon number densities.\nThermodynamical properties of the electroweak theory\nat nonzero lepton number density are interesting from\nmany points of view. Theoretically, the minimal standard model describes Nature to very high accuracy and\nthus it is important that we know the theory completely.\nEspecially the partition function is a fundamental concept and to know it under most general circumstances\n\n\u2217 e-mail:\n1\n\nantti.gynther@helsinki.fi\nTo fix the terminology, in this paper electroweak theory means\nthe electroweak sector of the minimal standard model with all\nknown physical parameters, essentially G\u03bc , mW , mZ and mtop ,\nbut parametrized with mH .\n\nis of interest. In cosmology, the neutrino degeneracy\n(the net neutrino number) of the universe is a poorly\nknown number. Best limits are given by constraints from\nbig bang nucleosynthesis and cosmic microwave background radiation which limits the degeneracy parameter\n\u03be\u03bd \u2261 \u03bc\u03bd /T\u03bd to \u03be\u03bc,\u03c4 \u2264 2.1 for the muon and tau neutrinos and to \u03bee \u2264 0.3 for the electron neutrino where\n\u03bc\u03bd are the neutrino chemical potentials and T\u03bd is the\ntemperature of the neutrino background [11]. If such\nlarge chemical potentials were present in the very early\nuniverse then it raises a question about how they affect\nthe electroweak thermodynamics and especially the electroweak phase transition. It has, for example, been proposed that the presence of a large lepton number asymmetry might explain the absence of topological defects\n[12] as well as the observed baryon number asymmetry\n[13]. Finally, a comparison between QCD thermodynamics and electroweak thermodynamics is interesting. QCD\nthermodynamics has of course attracted a lot of interest\nduring the last years due to experiments carried out at\nthe moment at RHIC in Brookhaven and in the future\nat LHC in CERN. It should be interesting to see how\nthe properties of the QCD phase transition as a function\nof baryonic chemical potential and number of light flavors (strange quark mass) compare to the properties of\nthe electroweak phase transition as a function of leptonic\nchemical potentials and number of light bosonic degrees\nof freedom (Higgs mass).\nThe role of finite lepton number density in the thermodynamics of the electroweak theory has been discussed already in the literature [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. Those\nstudies rely on perturbative one-loop calculations of the\neffective potential and the conclusion made is that the\ncritical temperature increases with increasing chemical\npotentials. This can be understood in terms of BoseEinstein condensation of the Higgs field due to finite\nchemical potentials related to gauge charges. The fate of\nthe W \u00b1 boson condensate, predicted in [15], at high temperatures is also discussed on the same footing [17, 18].\nVector boson condensation is also discussed in [21]\nPurely perturbative calculations are, however, doomed\ndue to infrared divergences and a nonperturbative study\nis needed, in general. However, direct Monte Carlo studies of the full electroweak theory at high temperatures\n\n\f2\nand finite chemical potentials are very difficult for numerous reasons. For example, the system is characterized by a multitude of scales extending from \u03c0T (mass\nscale of nonzero Matsubara modes) to g 2 T (mass scale of\nthe magnetic sector of the system). This leads to a need\nof large lattices in solving the properties of the system.\nFurthermore, chiral fermions are notoriously very hard\nto implement on a lattice. At finite density there is also\nthe famous \"sign\" problem: the fermionic determinant is\ncomplex and thus the integration measure is not positive\ndefinite which spoils importance sampling.\nWe approach this problem by generalizing the successful methods of [6, 7] to finite chemical potentials. That\nis, we calculate the dimensional reduction of the full\n4-dimensional electroweak theory at high temperatures\nand finite densities to a 3-dimensional effective field theory. The effective theory can then be solved using Monte\nCarlo methods in order to find out the phase diagram.\nThis method is, however, by construction limited to small\nchemical potentials.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section II we define the theories and give the matching between them. In\nsection III we give the results for the phase diagram and\nin the final section, section IV, we discuss their meaning.\nResults for the required sum-integrals are given in the\nAppendix A.\n\nII. DIMENSIONAL REDUCTION OF THE\nELECTROWEAK THEORY AT FINITE\nCHEMICAL POTENTIALS\n\nIn this section we describe the construction of high\ntemperature effective field theories at finite chemical potential.\n\nis taken to have a nonzero Yukawa coupling. The convention for the Euclidean gamma matrices is as given in [6].\nThe bosonic fields (\u03c6) are periodic in \u03c4 while fermionic\nfields (\u03c8) are anti-periodic.

In the electroweak theory, at classical level, the\nlepton number currents and the baryon number current\nare conserved independently. However, due to the triangle anomaly, these currents are not conserved in quantum\ntheory (for a review see, e.g. [22])\n\u2202\u03bc j\u03bc \u221d g 2 \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd Ga\u03b1\u03b2 Ga\u03bc\u03bd\n\nfor each current.\n\n(5)\n\nIt is thus possible to form only nf conserved linear combinations of these currents.

This can be seen explicitly below.\nTaking all the conserved currents into account, the partition function is given by the path integral [18]\n\u0001\nZ = Tr exp \u2212 \u03b2(H \u2212 \u03bci Xi \u2212 \u03bcY QY \u2212 \u03bcT 3 QT 3 ) (9)\n!#\n\"\nnf\nZ\nZ \u03b2 X\n(10)\n\u03bci X i\nd\u03c4\n= D\u03c6 exp \u2212 S \u2212\n0\n\n\u2261\n\nZ\n\n\"\n\nD\u03c6 exp \u2212S +\n\nZ\n\ni=1\n\n\u03b2\n\nd\u03c4\n\n0\n\n\u03bcB B +\n\nnf\nX\n\n\u03bcL i L i\n\ni=1\n\n!#\n\nwhere \u03c6 denotes the set of all the fields. Here we have\ndefined (\u03c6\u0303 excludes B0 and A30 )\nnf\n\n1 X\n\u03bci , \u03bcLi \u2261 \u2212\u03bci ,\nnf i=1\n\u0014\n\u0015\ni\u03bcY\ni\u03bcT 3\n3\nS = S \u03c6\u0303, B0 + \u2032 , A0 +\ng\ng\n\n\u03bcB \u2261\n\nand\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\nwith S containing also the gauge fixing\nP and ghost terms.\nWe see that the constraint nf \u03bcB + i \u03bcLi = 0 is satisfied. We also note from Eqs. (10) and (12) that after the\nintegration over the conjugated momentum fields is done\n(going from Eq. (9) to Eq. (10)), the chemical potentials\nrelated to the gauge charges enter the path integral the\nsame way as the static modes of the temporal components\nof the corresponding gauge fields. Thus, we can interpret them as acting as backgrounds for the gauge fields.\nTherefore, writing B0 \u2192 B0 + hB0 i, A30 \u2192 A30 + hA30 i\nand requiring stationarity of free energy with respect to\nexpectation values hB0 i and hA30 i (condition for thermal\nequilibrium) is equivalent to requiring neutrality with respect to corresponding gauge charges:\n0=\n\n\u2202 ln Z\nig \u2032 QY\n\u2202 ln Z\n=\u2212\n= \u2212ig \u2032\n\u2202hB0 i\n\u2202\u03bcY\nT\n\n(13)\n\nand similarly for hA30 i. It is then convenient to redefine\nB0 and A30 in Eqs. (10) and (12) as\ng \u2032 B0 \u2192 g \u2032 B0 \u2212 i\u03bcY ,\n\ngA30 \u2192 gA30 \u2212 i\u03bcT 3 .\n\n(14)\n\nThis way the action in Eq. (12) becomes the standard\nelectroweak action for these redefined fields and \u03bcY and\n\u03bcT 3 are not explicit in the path integral anymore. The\nchemical potentials can be recovered as expectation values for the redefined B0 and A30 at equilibrium2\nhB0 i =\n\ni\u03bcY\n,\ng\u2032\n\nhA30 i =\n\ni\u03bcT 3\n.\ng\n\n(15)\n\nThis explicitly shows that these chemical potentials cannot be chosen freely, but are fixed by requiring that the\nsystem be in thermal equilibrium.\n\nB.\n\nDimensional reduction at finite \u03bc\n\nDue to infrared divergences which arise when integrating over the bosonic zero modes \u03c60 (x) (static modes\nin \u03c4 ), the path integral (10) cannot be reliably evaluated within perturbation theory. The reason for this is\nthat these modes are light when the temperature is much\nlarger than any other mass scale in the theory and therefore the high temperature expansion parameter g 2 T /E\nis large for them. All the other modes (nonstatic in \u03c4 ),\n\u03c6n6=0 (x) and \u03c8n (x), are on the other hand always very\nmassive, m \u223c \u03c0T and can therefore be integrated out perturbatively, as can also the static modes with |p| > gT .\nWe are then led to a very natural idea of formulating\na three dimensional effective field theory for the static\nmodes \u03c60 (x) [6, 23]. This effective theory is defined to\nbe the most general theory for the static modes respecting the required symmetries. It reproduces the Green's\nfunctions for these static modes to a controllable accuracy.\nFinite fermion number density affects dimensional reduction in two ways. First, the renormalization of the\nfields and parameters as the heavy modes are integrated\nout changes when compared to the case \u03bc = 0. Second,\nthe symmetries of the fundamental four dimensional theory are reduced which gives rise to terms in the effective\ntheories absent at \u03bc = 0. More precisely, the introduction of chemical potentials to the theory leads to terms\nin the path integral which break C but preserve P and\nT thus making the theory, in addition to being C and P\nbreaking, also CP and CPT breaking. The effective theories may therefore contain terms which break CP and\nCPT and which do not appear at \u03bc = 0. Such terms\nmust nevertheless still preserve 3-dimensional gauge- and\nrotational invariance as well as T invariance.\nThe first effective theory is obtained after integrating out the nonzero Matsubara modes. The resulting\neffective theory is a 3-dimensional SU(2) \u00d7 U(1) gauge\nfield theory with a fundamental scalar doublet (Higgs)\n\n2\n\nTo be precise, this requires that the expectation values of the\noriginal B0 and A30 vanish in equilibrium. This certainly is the\ncase when the system is neutral.\n\n\f4\nB0 ; A 0\n\nAi\n\nAi\n\nAj\n\nBi\n\nBj\n\nAj\n\nAk\n\nB0\n\nFIG. 1: Diagrams leading to new terms in the effective theories. Solid lines correspond to fermions, wavy lines to gauge\nfields and dashed lines to scalars.\n\nand four adjoint scalars corresponding to the temporal components of the gauge fields in the fundamental 4-dimensional theory.

(16)\n3\nwhich arise from diagrams given in Fig. 1. The factors\nof i are chosen in such a way that these operators are T\ninvariant (with T transformations adopted from the 4dimensional theory). The effective theory does not contain the terms TrAa0 \u03c4 a and Tr(Aa0 \u03c4 a )3 since these vanish\nidentically due to the properties of the SU(2) generators.\nThe coefficient of the term B03 is of the order g \u20323 \u223c g 9/2\nand when the matching of the Green's functions is done\nto order g 4 it can be neglected.\nThe possibility that there are terms linear in the ad-\n\nL1 =\n\njoint scalars in the action of the effective theory is noteworthy. Such terms induce condensates of the corresponding fields in equilibrium. As already discussed,\nsuch condensates for the adjoint scalars are equivalent to\nnonzero chemical potentials for the gauge charges. Thus\nthe emergence of linear terms in the effective theory takes\ncare of neutrality of the system with respect to gauge\ncharges.\nThe last two terms of Eq. (16), the so called ChernSimons terms, are interesting. There of course is a vast\nliterature on the physics induced by them (for a review,\nsee [24]). That such terms appear in chiral gauge field\ntheories when fermions are integrated out was first observed in [25]. However, in the present study we observe that the coefficients of these terms in the effective theories\nP vanish due to the nonconservation of B + L\n(nf \u03bcB + i \u03bcLi = 0). Thus they do not play any role in\nthem. The role of those terms at smaller temperatures,\nwhere they may be important, has been discussed in [26].\nThe second effective theory is obtained after further integrating out the adjoint scalars, the zero components of\nthe gauge fields. The resulting theory is a 3-dimensional\nSU(2) \u00d7 U(1)+Higgs gauge field theory. The form of the\ntheory is fully determined by the gauge invariance. There\ncannot, therefore, be any terms in the theory that would\nbe absent at \u03bc = 0 as far as symmetries are considered\n(apart from the Chern-Simons terms, which nevertheless,\nas stated above, turn out to be absent). Finite chemical\npotentials show up only in the mapping of the parameters\nof this theory to the physical variables.\n\nC.\n\nIntegration over the superheavy modes\n\nThe first effective theory in its most general form is\ndefined by the Lagrangian\n\n\u00012 1\n1 a a\n1\n1\n\u2020\n2\nG G + Fij Fij + (Di \u03a6) Di \u03a6 + m23 \u03a6\u2020 \u03a6 + \u03bb3 \u03a6\u2020 \u03a6 + (Di Aa0 ) + m2D Aa0 Aa0\n4 ij ij 4\n2\n2\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\nB 2 + h3 \u03a6\u2020 \u03a6Aa0 Aa0 + h\u20323 \u03a6\u2020 \u03a6B02 + g3 g3\u2032 B0 \u03a6\u2020 Aa0 \u03c4 a \u03a6\n(17)\n+ \u03bbA Aa0 Aa0 Ab0 Ab0 + (\u2202i B0 ) + m\u20322\n4\n2\n2\u0013 D 0\n2\n\u0012\ni\n+\u03b1\u01ebijk Aai Gajk \u2212 g3 \u01ebabc Aai Abj Ack + \u03b1\u2032 \u01ebijk Bi Fjk + \u03ba1 B0 + \u03c1\u03a6\u2020 Aa0 \u03c4 a \u03a6 + \u03c1\u2032 \u03a6\u2020 \u03a6B0 + \u03c1G B0 Aa0 Aa0 ,\n3\n\nwhere Di Aa0 = \u2202i Aa0 \u2212g3 \u01ebabc Abi Ac0 .

This\nmatching has been performed for the minimal standard\nmodel at zero chemical potentials in [6].

Although not completely reliable, Veff is\nknown to give a rather good description of the phase transition at small mH where the scalar self coupling is small.\nStudies of the electroweak phase transition at finite chemical potentials using perturbatively derived effective potentials have been carried also previously [16, 17, 18].\nAt this point we are only interested in the\nqualitative effects finite chemical potentials can\nhave.\nTherefore, in order to simplify the procedure, we neglect the contributions from the terms\n\u03bbA Aa0 Aa0 Ab0 Ab0 , \u03c1\u03a6\u2020 Aa0 \u03c4 a \u03a6, \u03c1\u2032 B0 \u03a6\u2020 \u03a6 and \u03c1G B0 Aa0 Aa0 .\n\nVeff (\u03c6, hB0 i, hA30 i) =\n\n1\n1\n1 2 2 \u03bb3 4 1 2 3 2 1 \u20322\nm3 \u03c6 + \u03c6 + mD hA0 i + mD hB0 i2 + (h3 hA30 i2 + h\u20323 hB0 i2 )\u03c62 \u2212 g3 g3\u2032 \u03c62 hB0 ihA30 i\n2\n4\n2\n2\n4 \u0013\n\u00122\n1\n3 3 2\n3 2\n3 2 3/2\n\u20322 3/2 3\n2\n2 3/2\n+\u03ba1 hB0 i \u2212\n.\n(30)\ng (\u03c6 + 4hA0 i ) + (g3 + g3 ) \u03c6 + 2(mD + h3 \u03c6 )\n12\u03c0 4 3\n8\n\nRequiring neutrality with respect to gauge charges enforces the conditions\n\u2202Veff\n=0\n\u2202hB0 i\n\n\u2202Veff\n= 0,\n\u2202hA30 i\n\n(31)\n\nwhich gives us\nhB0 i = hB0 i0 + hB0 i1 , hA30 i = hA30 i0 + hA30 i1 with\n\u0012\n\u0013\nh3 2\n1\n\u03ba1\n\u0010\n\u0011 ,\nhB0 i0 = \u2212 \u20322 1 + 2 \u03c6\nh\u20323\nh3\nmD\nmD\n1+\n\u03c62\n2 +\n\u20322\nmD\n\nhA30 i0 =\n\nhB0 i1\nhA30 i1\n\n\u03ba1 g3 g3\u2032 \u03c62\n\u2212\n4m2D m\u20322\nD\n\n1\n\n1+\n\n\u0010\n\nh3\nm2D\n\n+\n\nh\u20323\nm\u20322\nD\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03c62\n\nmD\n\n,\n\np\n\u03c62 + 4hA30 i20\n3 g34 g3\u2032\n3\n2\n\u0010\n\u0011 , (32)\n=\nhA\ni\n\u03c6\n0\n0\nh\u20323\n16\u03c0 m2D m\u20322\nD\n1 + mh32 + m\u20322\n\u03c62\nD\nD\np\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c62 + 4hA30 i20\nh\u20323 2\n3 g33\n3\n\u0010\n\u0011 .\n1\n+\nhA\ni\n\u03c6\n=\n0\nh\u20323\n4\u03c0 m2D 0\nm\u20322\nD\n1 + mh32 + m\u20322\n\u03c62\nD\n\nD\n\nHere hB0 i0 and hA30 i0 are tree level contributions to the\nB0 and A30 condensates, and hB0 i1 and hA30 i1 are cor-\n\n(4)\n\nVeff (\u03c6) \u2248\n\nThis is motivated since \u03bbA \u223c g 4 and \u03c1G \u223c g 7/2 are\nsmall and since the three point vertices B0 \u03a6\u2020 \u03a6 \u223c \u03c1\u2032\nand Aa0 \u03a6\u2020 \u03a6 \u223c \u03c1 are negligible when compared to similar\nvertices obtained from the four point vertices B02 \u03a6\u2020 \u03a6\nand B0 \u03a6\u2020 Aa0 \u03c4 a \u03a6 after annihilating a B0 leg by the \u03ba1\nvertex. Likewise, we will use h3 = g32 /4, h\u20323 = g3\u20322 /4,\nneglecting higher order corrections, which simplifies\nsome expressions below. This is also consistent with all\nthe approximations above. Furthermore, we will only\nconsider quantum fluctuations of the magnetic sector\nAai , Bi and of the scalars A10 , A20 , and treat all the\ncondensing scalars \u03a6, B0 and A30 only at the tree level.\nThis approximation is adequate to show the effects\nof chemical potentials. A standard calculation of the\none-loop effective potential gives\n\nrections to those from the one-loop term of the effective\npotential. Inserting these back to the effective potential\nin Eq.

As can be seen, omission of the\nhigher order terms (see Eq. (33)) has only a small effect.\n\nwhere we have set all the leptonic chemical potentials\nequal and \u03bc = \u03bcLi = \u2212\u03bcB and only leading order terms\nin \u03bc are kept.\nThis effective potential gives a qualitative picture of\nthe effect of the chemical potentials. First, the critical\ntemperature increases due to decrease of the Higgs mass\nterm. Second, the scalar self-coupling increases leading\nto a smaller \u2206\u03c6 at the transition and thus to a weaker\ntransition. Also the \"barrier\" responsible for the first\norder phase transition is lower. All these effects can be\nseen in Fig. 5. In Fig. 6 it can be explicitly seen that\nfinite chemical potentials tend to break the symmetry of\nthe theory.\nThe leading \u03bc-induced corrections to both the scalar\nmass parameter and self-coupling come from the B0 condensate. Thus, at leading order the leptonic chemical\npotentials change the properties of the phase transition\nthrough generating nonzero chemical potentials for the\ngauge charges. These couple to the Higgs field and thus\nchange the dynamics of the Higgs field.\nWe can also note that the W \u00b1 boson mass is reduced\nin the broken phase due to the A30 condensate given in\nEq.

We, however, restrict\n\n3\n\n0\n\nThis means that the physics behind the W \u00b1 condensation is\nrelated to the nonzero chemical potentials for the gauge charges.\nThese chemical potentials couple to the W \u00b1 bosons and this\ncondensation is nothing but Bose-Einstein condensation due to\nthese chemical potentials.\n\nFIG. 6: The evolution of the effective potential at fixed temperature T = 98 GeV and Higgs mass mH = 60 GeV as the\nchemical potential is increased.\n\nourselves to small chemical potentials and study phenomena near the phase transition where \u03c62 \u226a T and then the\nW \u00b1 condensation is not relevant.\nAlthough the perturbatively derived effective potentials serve well in giving a qualitative, and even a quantitative, picture of the phase transition, they cannot be\ntrusted as the Higgs mass increases. This is clearly seen,\nfor example, in predictions of the nature of the phase\ntransition. Perturbative calculations predict a first order\nphase transition for all Higgs masses while nonperturbative studies show that there, in fact, is only a crossover\nfor mH & 72 GeV at \u03bc = 0. Since the physical Higgs\nmass is large, it is important not to rely on perturbative\ncalculations.\n\nE.\n\nIntegration over the adjoint scalars\n\nThe phase transition occurs when the scalar mass parameter m23 becomes small, m23 \u223c g 4 T 2 . Then the adjoint\nscalars may be considered heavy, m2D \u223c g 2 T 2 , and they\ncan therefore be integrated out. The resulting effective\ntheory is defined by the Lagrangian\n\u00012\n1 a a 1\n\u2020\nGij Gij + Fij Fij +(Di \u03a6) Di \u03a6+m\u030323 \u03a6\u2020 \u03a6+\u03bb\u03033 \u03a6\u2020 \u03a6 .\n4\n4\n(36)\nThis reduction step L1 \u2192 L2 is performed in [6] in the\ncase \u03ba1 = \u03c1 = \u03c1\u2032 = \u03c1G = 0. We now generalize this\nto finite \u03ba1 , \u03c1, \u03c1\u2032 and \u03c1G . We use as the expansion\nparameter h3 /mD and the goal is to calculate the corrections up to order (h3 /mD )2 m2D for the scalar mass and\nto order (h3 /mD )2 mD for the couplings in the reduction\nL1 \u2192 L2 .

This\nprotects us from neglecting \u03c1 and \u03c1\u2032 in situations where\nthey would be important.\nIt is essential to keep the chemical potentials sufficiently small in order to keep this last reduction step\nmeaningful. Consider, for example, the set of diagrams\nin Fig. 7a. Such diagrams would lead to terms of the\nform (\u03a6\u2020 \u03a6)n , n \u2265 3 in the final effective theory. If such\nhigher order terms are not to be included in the effec-\n\nm\u030323\n\u03bb\u03033\n\ntive theory, then the contribution of those terms to the\ncorresponding Green's functions must be sufficiently suppressed so that they can be neglected. More specifically,\nin the theory described by L2 , the leading contribution\nto the Green's function h(\u03a6\u2020 \u03a6)n i comes from the scalar\nloop in Fig. 7b and is by naive dimensional calculation of\nthe order \u03bb\u0303n3 m\u030333\u22122n \u223c (h3 /mD )3\u2212n m3\u2212n\nnear the phase\nD\ntransition where m\u030323 \u223c (h3 /mD )2 m2D . The contribution\nfrom the graph in Fig. 7a on the other hand is of the\norder of (h3 /mD )2\u03b1+n\u22123 m3\u2212n\nD . Thus, if we require that\nthe effective theory can reproduce the Green's functions\nup to order g 3 \u223c (h3 /mD )3 and we neglect the higher\norder operators produced by the graphs in Fig. 7a, then\nwe must require that\n3\n\u03bc\n\u03b1&\nor equivalently\n. g\u2032.\n(38)\n2\n\u03c0T\nThis determines the powercounting rules for \u03ba1 , \u03c1, \u03c1\u2032\nand \u03c1G which are used when integrating out the adjoint\nscalars.\nAnother set of interesting tree level diagrams are those\nin Fig. 7c. They would lead to terms of the form\n(\u03a6\u2020 \u03a6)n Aai Aai in the effective theory L2 . These are interesting since it is these terms that are responsible for\nthe W \u00b1 condensation, as can, for example, be seen from\nEq. (35). There the leading correction to the W \u00b1 mass\nis \u223c \u03c64 and thus the term in the effective theory L2\nthat would be responsible for this correction would be\n\u223c (\u03a6\u2020 \u03a6)2 Aai Aai . The above determined power counting\nrules allow us to neglect these terms but this means that\nthe effective theory L2 cannot predict W \u00b1 condensation.\nAs already discussed, this is not a problem when we study\nphenomena near the phase transition and at small chemical potentials.\nSince the reduction at \u03ba1 = \u03c1 = \u03c1\u2032 = \u03c1G = 0 is given\nin [6] we now only need to take into account the contribution from the new terms. Calculating to the accuracy\nmentioned before, they only contribute to the scalar mass\nparameter (up to one-loop level) and scalar self coupling\n(up to tree level). Other contributions are of higher order. The required diagrams are shown in Fig. 8.

There it was essential to assume that the chemical potential is small. This\nis easy to understand since some of the couplings of L1\nare directly proportional to \u03bc/(\u03c0T ) and thus \u03bc must be\nsmall when L1 is studied perturbatively. We may therefore assume that L1 is applicable to somewhat higher\nchemical potentials than L2 , up to \u03bc . \u03c0T . In the range\ng \u2032 \u03c0T \u2264 \u03bc \u2264 \u03c0T the dynamics of L1 may be dominated\nby nonperturbative effects.\n\nEnd point of the first\norder phase transition\nline\n\n\u03bb\u03033\n,\ng\u030332\n\ny\u2261\n\nm\u030323 (g\u030332 )\n,\ng\u030334\n\nz\u2261\n\ng\u03033\u20322\ng\u030332\n\n0\n\n\u22120.03\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\u03bc / GeV\n\n60\n\n\u22120.05\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n\u03bc / GeV\n\nFIG. 10: Behavior of xc and yc as a function of \u03bc for different Higgs masses. The regions above the line xc = xendpoint\nc\nand below the line yc = ycendpoint correspond to the crossover\nregion of the theory.\n\n(40)\n\nand leave g\u030332 to give the dimensions. The value of z\nis essentially fixed by the Weinberg mixing angle, z \u2248\ntan2 \u03b8W \u2248 0.3. The value of y is tuned to find the phase\ntransition at a fixed value of x which determines the nature of the phase transition.\nThe phase diagram of the effective theory is given in\nFig. 9. The continuous line is a curve fitted to the lattice results which are given in [7] and [9] for SU(2)+Higgs\ngauge theory. The effect of the U(1) subgroup is to increase the critical y slightly [7]. The critical line given by\na perturbative calculation is given by the dashed line. As\ncan be seen, the perturbative result gives quite a good\nestimate for the value of y at the transition, y = yc (x),\nfor small x. It, however, fails completely in describing\nthe nature of the transition at high x. Perturbation theory predicts a first order phase transition for all x, while\n\nMonte Carlo studies have shown that there is a first order\nphase transition at small x but that the first order phase\ntransition line has a second order endpoint at x \u2248 0.0983,\ny \u2248 \u22120.0173 and for larger x no phase transition is observed [7, 9]. Thus, there is no phase transition for sufficiently large Higgs masses.\nThe phase diagram in Fig. 9 can be expressed in terms\nof the physical parameters by the mapping described in\nsection II. For simplicity we set all the leptonic chemical\npotentials to be equal to each other, \u03bcLi = \u03bc = \u2212\u03bcB .\nThe theory is specified by giving the physical parameters the values G\u03bc = 1.664 * 10\u22125 GeV\u22122 , mW =\n80.42 GeV, mZ = 91.19 GeV, mt = 174.3 GeV and\n\u03b1s (mZ ) = 0.118. The Higgs mass is left as a free parameter.\nThe exact relation between (mH , T, \u03bc) and (x, y)\n\n\f11\n0.18\n\nis a complicated function of \u03bc. However, the essential\nfeatures of the effect of the chemical potentials can be\nseen quite easily by just taking the leading corrections\ndue to finite \u03bc into account. We get\n1 96 \u03bc2\nm2H\n1 96 \u03bc2\n\u2248\n,\n+\ng 2 1331 T 2\n8m2W\ng 2 1331 T 2\n\ny(\u03bc) \u2248 y(0) \u2212\n\n1 16 \u03bc2\ng 4 121 T 2\n\nm2\n1\n\u2248 \u2212 4H 2 + 2\n2g T\ng\n\u2212\n\n2\n\n0.14\nxc\n\nx(\u03bc) \u2248 x(0) +\n\n0.1\n\nm2H\n1 gY2\n3\n1 g\u2032\n+\n+\n+\n2\n2\n16mW\n16 16 g\n4 g2\n\n!\n\n(41)\n\nThus the effect of finite \u03bc is to increase x and decrease y.\nPerturbatively, at tree level the phase transition occurs\nat y = yc = 0. The critical temperature can then be\nsolved to be\n\u0012\n\u0013\n256 2\n1\n2\n8m\n+\n(42)\nT02 =\n\u03bc\nH\n8\u03bb + 3g 2 + g \u20322 + 4gY2\n121\nwhich explicitly shows that a finite chemical potential\nincreases the critical temperature. At one-loop order the\ncritical line is given by yc x = 1/(128\u03c0 2 ) and expanding\nthis around the tree level solution Tc = T0 we get for the\ncritical temperature (to first order in (Tc \u2212 T0 )/T0 )\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n6\n1\ng\n1\n\uf8f8.\nTc = T0 \uf8ed1 +\n16\u03c0 2 8\u03bb + 3g 2 + g \u20322 + 4gY2 \u03bb + 96 \u03bc22\n1331 T0\n\n(43)\nThe factor multiplying the tree level critical temperature\ndecreases as the chemical potentials are increased but\nthat decrease is negligible in comparison to the simultaneous increase in T0 . Thus the critical temperature\nincreases also at one-loop order.\nThe above reasoning gives a valid qualitative understanding of the behaviour of the system but to obtain\nquantitatively more reliable results we must map the\nphase diagram in Fig. 9 to (T, \u03bc, mH ) using the complete results from section II. Then the values of x and\ny along the phase transition line, xc = x(Tc , \u03bc, mH ) and\nyc = y(Tc , \u03bc, mH ), are given in Fig. 10 as functions of\n\u03bc. It can be observed that as the chemical potentials\nare increased, the subsequent increase and decrease of xc\nand yc , respectively, are fastest at small Higgs masses.\nThis is easy to understand since xc and yc are essentially\nfunctions of \u03bc/T . Thus, at small Higgs masses where\nthe critical temperature is lower, increasing \u03bc leads to a\nlarger increase in \u03bc/Tc than at large Higgs masses where\nthe critical temperature is higher. Therefore the changes\nin xc and yc are also larger at smaller Higgs masses.\nThis has an interesting consequence. The xc (\u03bc) curves\nfor different mH intersect and for sufficiently large chemical potentials the value of xc is, in fact, a decreasing function of the Higgs mass (at least for sufficiently small Higgs\n\nxc\n\nendpoint\n\n0.06\n\n0.02\n\n1 16 \u03bc2\n.\ng 4 121 T 2\n\n\u03bc = 0 GeV\n\u03bc = 15 GeV\n\u03bc = 30 GeV\n\u03bc = 45 GeV\n\u03bc = 60 GeV\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nmH / GeV\n\nFIG. 11: The behavior of xc as a function of mH .\n\nmasses). This can be seen explicitly in Fig. 11. Therefore, under these specific conditions, the phase transition\nappears to become stronger as the Higgs mass is increased\n(again, at least as long as the Higgs mass remains sufficiently small). This, however, does not seem to have\nany physical relevance. Dimensional reduction is not reliable at small Higgs masses where this effect is strongest.\nAs the Higgs mass is increased also the chemical potentials must be increased in order to recover this anomalous behaviour. However, at these larger Higgs masses\nand chemical potentials, the value of xc is above the endpoint value xendpoint\n= 0.0983 and there is therefore no\nc\nphase transition. Especially, at physical Higgs masses,\nmH & 115 GeV, there is no phase transition.\nThe phase diagram in terms of the physical parameters\nis given in Figs. 12 and 13. The qualitative picture based\non perturbation theory can be seen to be correct. The\ncritical temperature increases with \u03bc. Some interesting\nthermodynamics can be deduced from this. According to\nthe Clausius-Clapeyron relations\ndT\nns \u2212 nb\n,\n=\u2212\nd\u03bc\nss \u2212 sb\n\n(44)\n\nwhere dT /d\u03bc is measured along the phase transition line,\nand ns,b and ss,b are the lepton number and entropy densities in each phase, respectively. Since dT /d\u03bc is positive,\nthe lepton number difference between the phases is of the\nopposite sign than the entropy difference. Furthermore,\nsince entropy is higher in the symmetric phase (the high\ntemperature phase) it means that the lepton number density is higher in the broken symmetry phase.\nThe behaviour of the endpoint of the first order phase\ntransition line is also of interest. For a fixed Higgs mass,\na finite chemical potential strengthens the scalar selfcoupling at the transition point as seen from Fig. 10.\nThus, increasing \u03bc weakens the transition and the value\nof the critical Higgs mass where the first order phase transition line ends in a second order endpoint is a decreasing\nfunction of \u03bc.

In\nparticular, we have studied the change of the second order endpoint of the first order phase transition line. It\nis seen that the critical temperature increases and the\ncritical value of Higgs mass where the first order phase\ntransition line ends decreases as the chemical potentials\nare increased. These results are summarized in Fig. 14.\nIt is interesting to qualitatively compare these results for the critical temperature T = Tc (mH , \u03bc) of the\nelectroweak phase transition to the critical temperature\nT = Tc (ms , \u03bcB ), ms = strange quark mass, \u03bcB = baryonic chemical potential, of the QCD phase transition. In\nQCD there is also a first order critical line ending in a\n2nd order point: if \u03bcB = 0 then for ms = 0 (Nf = 3)\nthere is a first order phase transition while for ms = \u221e\n(Nf = 2) there is only a crossover. Thus, the situation\non the ms \u2212 T plane is like in Fig. 12. However, in contrast to Fig. 13, on the \u03bcB \u2212 T plane the critical lines for\ndifferent ms bend downwards starting from \u03bcB = 0 (in\nFig. 12 the \u03bcB > 0 curves would reside below the \u03bcB = 0\ncurve). As discussed after Eq. (44), this implies that in\nthe QCD phase transition the entropy density and the\nbaryon number density change in a similar way. Also,\nin QCD, when ms is large enough, there is a first order\nphase transition only if \u03bcB is greater than some critical\nvalue \u03bcB,c (ms ), again in contrast to Fig. 13 which says\nthat there is a first order electroweak phase transition\nonly if \u03bc is less then some critical value \u03bcc (mH ).\n\n\f13\nThe effective theory used in this paper to study the\nelectroweak phase transition cannot be used at large\nchemical potentials. Therefore, it cannot, for example,\npredict the emergence (or perhaps lack of it) of the W \u00b1\ncondensate. The reason for this is that the driving force\nbehind the W \u00b1 condensation, Bose-Einstein condensation, would appear in this theory through higher order\nterms of the form (\u03a6\u2020 \u03a6)n Aai Aai , n \u2265 2. Those terms\nwould modify the W \u00b1 mass in such a way that the condensation might occur. We have, however, neglected such\nhigher order terms from the theory which is possible if\nthe chemical potentials are small. The W \u00b1 condensation is in any case a high \u03bc phenomenon and thus our\napproximation is self consistent.\n\nsional momentum integration and then performing the\nsum using Riemann zeta functions.
