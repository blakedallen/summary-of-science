They motivated the\nEmail address: reis@if.uff.br (F. D. A. Aar\u00e3o Reis).\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science\n\n5 September 2018\n\n\fstudy of many interface growth models, which led to significant advances in\nnon-equilibrium Statistical Mechanics and related fields [2,3].\nThe simplest quantitative characteristic of a given interface is its roughness,\nalso called the interface width, defined as the rms fluctuation of the height\n2\naround its average position. The squared width, w2 \u2261 h2 \u2212 h , is usually averaged over different configurations, and its scaling on time and length is used\nto characterize the growth process. For short times, in the so-called growth\nregime, the average roughness increases as hw2 igr \u223c t2\u03b2 , where \u03b2 is the growth\nexponent. For long times in a finite substrate, a steady state is attained, where\nthe average roughness scales with the linear size L as\nhw2 i \u223c L2\u03b1 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwith \u03b1 called the roughness exponent (notice that steady state averages are\ndenoted without further labels here, while indexes s or sat are frequently\nused in the literature to denote saturation). The connection of discrete or\ncontinuous growth models to certain growth equations is frequently based\non accurate numerical calculation of those scaling exponents. However, this\nprocedure may be quite difficult when huge finite-size or finite-time corrections\nare present in the scaling of hw2 i.\nAlternatively, one may investigate features of the full roughness distribution,\nP (w2 ), which is the probability density of the roughness of a given configuration to lie in the range [w2 , w2 + dw2 ]. In recent years, the steady state\ndistributions of several interface models have been analyzed [4,5,6,7] and they\nwere shown to fit the scaling form\n!\n\n1\nw2\nP (w2 ) =\n.\n\u03a6\nhw2 i\nhw2 i\n\n(2)\n\nAlternatively, the scaling relation\nw2 \u2212 hw2 i\n1\nP (w2 ) = \u03a8\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\n!\n\n(3)\n\ncan be adopted, where\n\u03c3\u2261\n\nq\n\nhw2 2 i \u2212 hw2 i2\n\n(4)\n\nis the rms deviation of the squared roughness. Despite the study of roughness distributions being useful for determining the universality classes of some\ngrowth processes, it is usually performed independently of the calculation of\n2\n\n\fscaling exponents (notice that the values of the exponents are not necessary\nto fit the scaled distributions). Indeed, finite-size corrections in the universal\nfunctions \u03a6 and \u03a8 are typically much smaller than those in the Family-Vicsek\nscaling relation [8], which gives Eq. (1) a limiting case.\nOn the other hand, from Eqs. (3) and (4), we expect that the roughness fluctuation \u03c3 in the steady state scales with exponent \u03b1 as the average roughness:\n\u03c3 \u223c L2\u03b1 .\n\n(5)\n\nConsequently, numerical estimates of \u03c3 may also be used to estimate \u03b1, but,\nas far as we know, this was not done in previous works. The expectation of\nweaker finite-size corrections using \u03c3 instead of hw2 i follows from the recent\nobservation [7] that Eq. (3) provides a better data collapse of simulation data\nwhen compared to Eq. (2), for several growth models.\nIn order to estimate a scaling exponent with accuracy, the standard method is\nto extrapolate effective exponents obtained from consecutive slopes of log-log\nplots (see, e. g., Appendix A of Ref. [2]). Here, we will show that the effective exponents obtained from \u03c3 provide reliable estimates of the roughness\nexponent and, in some cases, varies with L slower than the estimates from the\naverage width hw2 i. This is illustrated with applications to three growth models which belong to different universality classes, in one- and two-dimensional\nsubstrates.\nSubsequently, we will apply this method to calculate the roughness exponent\nof two versions of the ballistic depositon (BD) model [9] in two-dimensional\nsubstrates. Numerical works showed discrepancies in the estimates of that exponent in d = 2 and a rigorous derivation of a continuous equation for BD [10]\ndeviates from the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation [12]. However, when\neffective exponents of BD are calculated with \u03c3, the asymptotic estimates of\n\u03b1 are close to the best known KPZ values. The conclusion that this is the\nuniversality class of BD is reinforced by the comparison of the full roughness\ndistributions.\nThe rest of this work is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we present the models\nwhich will be used to test the method for estimating roughness exponents and\nthe results of these tests. In Sec. 3 we apply that method to two versions of BD\nin d = 2 and analyze their roughness distributions. In Sec. 4 we summarize\nour results and conclusions.\n3\n\n\f2\n\nTests of the method in models of the KPZ and the VLDS classes\n\nThe first model analyzed here is the RSOS model [13], in which the incident\nparticle can stick at the top of a column only if the differences of heights of\nall pairs of neighboring columns do not exceed \u2206H max = 1 after aggregation. Otherwise, the aggregation attempt is rejected. The second model was\nproposed for etching of a crystalline solid by Mello et al [14]: at each growth\nattempt, a randomly chosen column i, with current height h(i) \u2261 h0 , has its\nheight increased of one unit (h(i) \u2192 h0 +1), and all neighboring column whose\nheights are smaller than h0 grows to h0 (this may be called the growth version\nof the etching model [11]).\nIn the limit of large lengths and long times, these models are represented by\nthe KPZ equation [12]\n\u2202h\n= \u03bd2 \u22072 h + \u03bb2 (\u2207h)2 + \u03b7(~x, t).\n\u2202t\n\n(6)\n\nHere, \u03bd2 and \u03bb2 are\u0010 constants\nand\u0010 \u03b7 is a \u0011Gaussian noise with zero mean and\n\u0011\n\u2032\n\u2032\n~\nvariance h\u03b7 (~x, t) \u03b7 x , t i = D\u03b4 d ~x \u2212 x~\u2032 \u03b4 (t \u2212 t\u2032 ), where d is the dimension\nof the substrate. In d = 1, the exact roughness exponent is \u03b1 = 1/2 [12,2], and\nin d = 2 the best numerical estimates are around 0.38\u22120.39 [15,11]. Numerical\nestimates of hw2 i for the RSOS and etching models in d = 1 provide estimates\nof exponents which converge to the exact values with negligible finite-size\ncorrections. However, that is not the case in d = 2, particularly for the etching\nmodel [11], consequently our tests will focus this case.\nThe widths hw2 i and their fluctuations \u03c3 were calculated at the steady states in\ntwo-dimensional substrates up to L = 256 for the RSOS model and up to L =\n512 for the etching model. Finite-size estimates of the roughness exponents\nare given by\n\u03b1w (L) \u2261\n\n1 ln [hw2 i (L) /hw2 i (L/2)]\n2\nln 2\n\n(7)\n\n\u03b1\u03c3 (L) \u2261\n\n1 ln [\u03c3 (L) /\u03c3 (L/2)]\n.\n2\nln 2\n\n(8)\n\nand\n\nThe presence of significant corrections to Eqs. (1) and (5) is reflected in a\nsize-dependence of \u03b1w (L) and \u03b1\u03c3 (L). These effective exponents are shown in\nFig. 1 for the RSOS and the etching models as a function of 1/L and 2/L,\nrespectively.\n4\n\n\fAn asymptotic estimate near 0.39 is consistent with the trend of the RSOS\ndata as L \u2192 \u221e. For this model, small differences in the estimates obtained\nfrom hw2 i and \u03c3 are observed, as well as weak finite-size effects. The linear fit\nof \u03b1w (L) shown in Fig. 1 suggests \u03b1 \u2248 0.39.\nHowever, the finite-size dependence of the data for the etching model is remarkable: the effective exponents vary between 0.34 and 0.38 in Fig. 1. For\nthe largest lengths L, \u03b1\u03c3 (L) approaches the asymptotic region \u03b1 \u2248 0.39 faster\nthan \u03b1w (L), as illustrated by the curves through the data points in Fig. 1.\nIt suggests that, for large L, the corrections to the scaling of \u03c3 are smaller\nthan the corrections to hw2 i. Although the fits of the data in Fig. 1 do not\nrepresent systematic extrapolation procedures, our interpretation is reinforced\nby the fact that the extrapolated \u03b1\u03c3 (L) for the etching model is very close to\nthe value predicted by the RSOS model.\n\nFig. 1. Effective exponents \u03b1w (L) (empty symbols) and \u03b1\u03c3 (L) (full symbols), for\nthe RSOS model (squares) and the etching model (triangles) in two-dimensional\nsubstrates, as a function of 1/L or 2/L. \u03b1\u03c3 (L) data are slightly shifted to the right\nto avoid superposition of data points. Error bars are compared to the size of the\npoints, except for the largest lengths, in which the uncertainties are around 0.005\nfor both models. The lines connecting the data points (except \u03b1\u03c3 (L) data for the\nRSOS model) were drawn to guide the eye.\n\nFor the etching model, we were not able to perform reliable extrapolations of\n\u03b1w (L) or \u03b1\u03c3 (L) as functions of 1/L\u2206 , with any exponent \u2206 > 0 (the value\n\u2206 = 1 is used in Fig. 1). This is related to the large deviations from the\nasymptotic scaling in small lattices, typically L < 50. It contrasts to Ref. [11],\n5\n\n\fwhere a extrapolation of \u03b1w (L) up to L = 1024 was possible with \u2206 \u223c 0.5.\nHowever, here we are working with data for L \u2264 256 because there are very\nlarge error bars in the estimates of \u03c3 for larger lattices. With a small number\nof data points, even more sophisticated extrapolation methods [16] are not\nable to provide better estimates than previous work.\nAn extended version of the conserved RSOS (CRSOS) model is also suitable\nfor this test. In this model, if the aggregation at the column of incidence disobeys the condition \u2206H max = 1, then the incident particle executes a random\nwalk among neighboring columns until finding a column in which it can aggregate [17]. The CRSOS model belongs to the class of the nonlinear molecularbeam epitaxy equation, or Villain-Lai-Das Sarma (VLDS) equation [18,19]\n\n\u2202h\n= \u03bd4 \u22074 h + \u03bb4 \u22072 (\u2207h)2 + \u03b7(~x, t),\n\u2202t\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03bd4 and \u03bb4 are constants. Our extended version of the CRSOS model is\ndifferent from the original one [20] but has the same symmetries and, consequently, belong to the same universality class.\nIn Fig. 2 we show the effective exponents of this model obtained from simulations up to L = 256, with linear fits of both data sets. The evolution of \u03b1\u03c3 (L)\nand \u03b1w (L) suggest \u03b1 \u2248 0.93 asymptotically, but the difference between \u03b1\u03c3 (L)\nand the asymptotic value is clearly much smaller. This is consistent with the\ndifferent slopes of the linear fits shown in Fig. 2 (smaller slope for fitting\n\u03b1\u03c3 (L)).\nThis application provides additional support to the conclusion that \u03b1 < 1 in\nthe VLDS class in d = 1 [21] (\u03b1 = 1 is obtained from one-loop renormalization). The estimate \u03b1 = 0.93 \u00b1 0.01 follows from the extrapolation of those\ndata. It improves our previous estimate \u03b1 = 0.94 \u00b1 0.02, obtained in Ref.\n[17], where effective exponents were calculated from the second and fourth\nmoments of the height distribution in sizes up to L = 1024.\nThe above analysis, performed with models in different universality classes and\nwith noticeable (but not huge) finite-size corrections to Eq. (1), shows that\nroughness exponents may be estimated from \u03c3 with comparable or higher accuracy than those obtained from w2 , suggesting its application to controversial\nsituations.\n6\n\n\fFig. 2. Effective exponents \u03b1w (L) (empty squares) and \u03b1\u03c3 (L) (full squares), for the\nCRSOS model in one-dimensional substrates, as a function of 1/L. Error bars are\nof the size of the data points. The dotted and dashed lines are linear fits of each\ndata set.\n\n3\n\nApplication to ballistic deposition\n\nIn the simplest version of the ballistic deposition model, particles are released\nfrom a randomly chosen position above a d-dimensional substrate, follow trajectories perpendicular to the surface and stick upon first contact with a nearest neighbor occupied site [8,9]. The resulting aggregate is porous and has a\nrough surface. Several applications of the BD model or its extensions to real\ngrowth processes were already proposed, which justifies the present analysis\n(see e. g. recent applications in Refs. [22,23]).\nThe mechanism of lateral aggregation suggests that BD is in the KPZ class.\nHowever, several numerical works on this model showed discrepancies between\nthe estimated exponents and the KPZ values [8,24,25,26]. In a recent work, we\nhave shown that the KPZ values are obtained with good accuracy in d = 1 if\neffective exponents \u03b1w (L) are properly extrapolated [27]. In d = 2, the effective roughness exponents rapidly vary with L, but they are still far from the\nregion [0.38, 0.40] up to L = 512 [27]. An apparent consistency with the KPZ\nvalue is obtained in d = 2 only after assuming of a constant correction term in\n7\n\n\fEq. (1) (the intrinsic width), but error bars are very large [11]. Consequently,\nfrom numerical work, there is no clear evidence that BD is in the KPZ class\nin d = 2.\nRecently, Katzav and Schwartz derived a continuous equation for another version of BD which differs from the KPZ equation [10]. They analyzed the BD\nmodel with next-nearest neighbor aggregation, hereafter called BDNNN, in\nwhich the incident particle sticks upon first contact with a nearest neighbor\nor with a next-nearest neighbor occupied site. In d = 1, they showed that the\nsquared gradient in Eq. (6) is replaced by the absolute value of the gradient\nin the continuous equation corresponding to BDNNN. This is suggested as\na possible reason for the slow convergence of the scaling exponents to their\nasymptotic values. In d \u2265 2 the situation is more complicated: the only contribution to the local growth rate comes from the direction xm along which the\n\u2202h\n\u22022h\nheight gradient is maximum, and that contribution is 21 \u2202x\n. This ac2 + \u2202x\nm\nm\ncounts for the maximal growth ingredient of the model. However, the presence\nof the lattice axis in that equation contrasts with the rotation symmetry of\nthe KPZ equation. Thus, also from analytical work, there is no a priori reason\nto expect BD to be in the KPZ class [10].\nThis scenario motivates the extension of our method to estimate roughness\nexponents of BD and BDNNN in d = 2. Simulations of both models were\nperformed in lattices up to L = 512, where w2 and \u03c3 can be obtained with\nreasonable accuracy. The number of different realizations used to estimate\nthose quantities were near 108 for L \u2264 128, 107 for L = 256 and 2 \u00d7 106 for\nL = 512.\nIn Fig. 3a we show \u03b1w (L) and \u03b1\u03c3 (L) for the original BD model. \u03b1w (L) rapidly\nvaries with L in the whole range of our data and attains a value near 0.28 in\nthe largest lattice, which is much smaller than the estimates for the KPZ\nclass. This complex finite-size behavior was already pointed out in Ref. [27]\nand, consequently, no reliable extrapolation of \u03b1 could be extracted from those\ndata. On the other hand, \u03b1\u03c3 (L) is in the range [0.36, 0.37] for the largest L.\nAs 1/L \u2192 0, Fig. 3a indicates that \u03b1\u03c3 (L) converges to an asymptotic value\nbetween 0.36 and 0.4.\nIn Fig. 3b we show the effective exponents for the BDNNN model. We notice\nthat \u03b1w (L) is even farther from the KPZ estimate in this model. However,\nthe trend of \u03b1\u03c3 (L) as 1/L \u2192 0 suggests an asymptotic value between 0.35\nand 0.4, although finite-size effects seem to be much stronger than those of\nthe original BD model.\nExtrapolations of \u03b1w (L) and \u03b1\u03c3 (L) for BD and BDNNN as functions of 1/L\u2206 ,\nvarying the exponent \u2206 along the same lines of Ref. [11], were also tested, but\nno significant improvement of the above mentioned estimates was obtained.\n8\n\n\fFig. 3. Effective exponents \u03b1w (L) (empty symbols) and \u03b1\u03c3 (L) (full symbols) for:\n(a) the original BD model in d = 2; (b) the BDNNN model in d = 2. The lines\nconnecting the data points were drawn to guide the eye.\n\nHowever, those estimates are consistent with the best currently avaiable values\nfor the KPZ class, which lie in the range [0.375, 0.396] [15,11], which strongly\nsuggests that BD and BDNNN are also in that class in d = 2.\nAnother important test is a comparison of the full roughness distributions of\nthese models and that of other KPZ models. The distribution for the RSOS\nmodel, which shows negligible finite-size effects, can be used as a representative\nof the KPZ class [7]. In Fig. 4 we show this distribution, scaled according to\nEq. (3), and the scaled distributions for the BD and the BDNNN models in\nL = 256 (data for L = 512 was not used here due to their lower accuracy,\nmainly in the tails of the distribution). The collapse of all data into a single\nuniversal curve reinforces our conclusion that both models are in the KPZ\nclass in d = 2.\n9\n\n\fFig. 4. Scaled roughness distribution at the steady states of the RSOS model\n(solid curve), the BD model (squares) and the BDNNN model (triangles), in\n2 + 1-dimensional lattices of length L = 256.\n\nA quantitative support to the universality of the scaled distributions of Fig. 4\nis given by the estimates of the skewness and kurtosis of those curves. For the\nRSOS and the etching models, S = 1.70\u00b10.02 and Q = 5.4\u00b10.3 were obtained\nin Ref. [7]. Here, for BD we obtained S = 1.71 \u00b1 0.02 and Q = 5.4 \u00b1 0.1, and\nfor BDNNN we obtained S = 1.67 \u00b1 0.03 and Q = 5.2 \u00b1 0.3, both in good\nagreement with the values of the other KPZ models.\n\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nWe proposed the calculation of roughness exponents from the scaling of roughness fluctuations \u03c3 in the steady states. Tests for two models in the 2 + 1dimensional KPZ class and for a model in the 1 + 1-dimensional VLDS class\nwere performed and showed that effective exponents obtained from that quantity provide comparable or better asymptotic estimates than the average width\nhw2 i. We also applied this method to two versions of the ballistic deposition\nmodel, the original one (BD) and the next-nearest neighbor one (BDNNN),\nin order to clarify a controversy on its universality class raised by numerical\n10\n\n\fresults and an exact derivation of its corresponding continuous equation. Effective exponents calculated from \u03c3 suggest that the asymptotic class is KPZ,\nwhile those calculated from hw2 i show much more complex finite-size behavior. Additional support to this conclusion is obtained from the collapse of the\nfull roughness distributions of those models into the distribution of the RSOS\nmodel.\nAt this point it is important to recall that higher\nmoments\nof the height\n\u001c\n\u001d\n4\n\ndistribution, such as the fourth moment hw4 i \u2261 h \u2212 h\n\n, are also frequently\n\nused to estimate the roughness exponent. Their accuracy is usually lower than\nthat of hw2 i and, consequently, do not improve the estimates of \u03b1 (see e. g.\nRef. [11]). This quantity, however, must not be confused with \u03c3 2 , which is the\nfluctuation of the global roughness in the steady state.\nThe successful application of the above method to estimate the roughness exponent, possibly combined with the analysis of roughness distributions, suggests its extension to other models in which remarkable finite-size corrections\nin the effective exponents are observed.\n\nReferences\n[1] Frontiers in surface and interface science, eds.
