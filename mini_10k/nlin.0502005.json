We also describe elliptic spatial solitons controlled by the waveguide boundaries.\n\narXiv:nlin/0502005v1 [nlin.PS] 3 Feb 2005\n\nPACS numbers:\n\nPhotonic crystal fibers (PCF) have attracted a lot of\nattention due to their intriguing properties, potential applications, and the development of successful fabrication\ntechnologies [1]. PCFs are characterized by a conventional cylindric geometry with a two-dimensional lattice\nof air holes running parallel to the fiber axis. Such structures share many properties of photonic crystals, associated with the existence of the frequency gaps where the\nlight transmission is suppressed due to Bragg scattering,\nas well as the guiding properties of conventional optical\nfibers, due to the presence of a core in the structure.\nRecent theoretical and experimental results reported\nthe studies and fabrication of dual-core PCF structures\nfor broadband directional coupling or polarization splitting [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. In PCFs, light confinement is restricted to the core of the fiber and therefore nonlinear\neffects, such as light self-trapping and localization in the\nform of spatial optical solitons [7], become important. In\nparticular, similar to two-dimensional nonlinear photonic\ncrystals [8], a PCF can support and stabilize both fundamental and vortex spatial optical solitons [9, 10]. In\na sharp contrast with an entirely homogeneous nonlinear\nKerr medium where spatial solitons are unstable and may\ncollapse, it was shown that the periodic structure of PCF\ncan stabilize the otherwise unstable two-dimensional solitons.\nIn this Letter, we make a further step forward in the\nstudy of nonlinear effects in the PCF geometry, and analyze the existence and stability of nonlinear guided modes\nand spatial solitons in dual-core photonic crystal fiber\ncouplers. The beam propagation and power-dependent\nswitching in nonlinear directional couplers have been analyzed for the planar waveguide geometry [11]. Here we\ngeneralize those results for PCFs, as well as study the\nexistence and stability of guided modes and elliptic spatial solitons controlled by the PCF holes. In particular,\nwe find numerically the profiles of symmetric, antisymmetric, and asymmetric nonlinear modes, and analyze\nall-optical switching based on the mode instability.\nWe consider a simple model of PCF that describes, at\na given frequency, the spatial distribution of light in a\nnonlinear dielectric material with a triangular lattice of\nair holes with the radius r in a circular geometry. We assume that the PCF material possesses a nonlinear Kerr\nresponse, and there are two holes at the center filled by\n\n\u039b\n\n(a)\n\n2r\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFIG. 1: (a-c) Schematic of three designs of a nonlinear dualcore photonic crystal fiber. The coupler is created by two\nmissing neighboring holes in a nonlinear material.\n\nthe same material creating a nonlinear defect, as shown\nin Figs. 1(a-c). In the substrate material, the linear refractive index is ns , whereas inside the holes it is na .\nIn the nonlinear regime, the light distribution in PCF is\ndescribed by the equation,\n\u2212i\n\n\u2202E\n= \u2206\u22a5 E + W (x, y)E + V (x, y)|E|2 E,\n\u2202z\n\n(1)\n\nwhere W (x, y) = na + (ns \u2212 na )V (x, y), \u2206\u22a5 = \u2202 2 /\u2202x2 +\n\u2202 2 /\u2202y 2 is the transverse Laplacian, E is the normalized\nelectric field, and V (x, y) is an effective potential describing two solid cores in the lattice of holes. We normalize\nV = 1 in the material, and V = 0 in the holes.\nTo find stationary nonlinear modes of PCF, we look for\nsolutions in the form E(x, y, z) = u(x, y) exp(i\u03b2z), and\nobtain the nonlinear eigenvalue problem,\n\u03b2u = \u2206\u22a5 u + W (x, y)u + V (x, y)|u|2 u.\n\n(2)\n\nIn order to find the solutions of Eq. (2) for nonlinear\nlocalized modes, we consider a rectangular domain of\nthe (x, y) plane and apply a finite-difference scheme, taking respectively N and M uniformly distributed samples,\nxi , 0 \u2264 i < N and yj , 0 \u2264 j < M of the variables, as well\nas the corresponding samples for the stationary state,\nuij = u(xi , xj ) and the potential Vij = V (xi , yj ). Substituting these variables into the model (2), and imposing\nhomogeneous boundary conditions in all four edges of\nthe domain, we obtain an algebraic nonlinear problem of\n2 \u00d7 N \u00d7 M equations with the same number of unknowns\nuij , which is finally solved by means of a globally convergent Newton method.

Another approach, that takes\nan advantage of the lattice periodicity, was developed recently by Ferrando et al. [9].\nFirst, we consider a single missing hole and find numerically solutions for the PCF spatial solitons [9]. Importantly, these stationary solutions are not perfectly radial, but they are stabilized by the PCF holes, in a sharp\ncontrast with the unstable self-trapped beams in nonlinear focusing Kerr media. In order to demonstrate this\nfeature, we follow the standard analysis of the soliton\nstability [7] and analyze the soliton power as a function\nof the soliton propagation constant.

The corresponding solutions are similar for two cases of Figs 1(a,b),\nand they can be envisaged as the modes of the effective\ndual-core fiber generated by the combined effect of the\ndual-core PCF refractive index and the nonlinear index\ninduced by the mode amplitude itself. We find that the\nnonlinear dual-core PCF supports three distinct nonlinear modes, symmetric mode (A), antisymmetric mode\n(B), and asymmetric mode (C), as shown in Fig. 2 for\nthe case of Fig. 1(b). The corresponding spatial profiles\nof these modes are shown in Fig. 2(d) as cross-section\ncuts along the line y = 0. All the calculations are for\nns = 5, na = 0, r = 0.75 and \u039b = 2.\nTo demonstrate the power relation between the modes,\nwe follow the standard analysis of the soliton stability [12]\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nPin\nFIG. 4: Switching curve calculated for the PCF nonlinear\ncoupler of Fig. 1(b). Due to instability of the symmetric\nmode, the light launched into one core only does not switch\nto the second core but remains in the same core.\n\nIn order to study the switching properties of the nonlinear coupler, we carry out a series of numerical simulations using the standard beam propagation method.\nFirst, we calculate the stationary mode of a singlecore PCF with the same parameters as the coupler corresponding to different powers. Then, this mode is\nlaunched into one of the cores of the dual-core coupler\nand, after some propagation, the output power is calculated at the same core.

For the\nparameters used in our examples this point is reached at\nz = 21.23. The switching curve is obtained by varying\nthe input power for the fixed propagation length, and it\nis plotted in Fig. 4. Similar to other types of nonlinear\ndirectional couplers, the input power is transferred completely to the second core for low powers, while for it remains in the initial one for higher input powers. A change\nbetween both the regimes takes place in a relatively short\nrange of powers which constitutes a threshold where the\npower switching is triggered. For very low powers the\nenergy is completely transferred to the second core, although from the plot in Fig. 4 a residual amount seems\n\n[1] Ph. Russell, Science 299, 358 (2003)\n[2] F. Fogli, L.

This nonzero behavior of the\ncurve close to the origin is explained by the overlapping\nof the field of the second core due to its proximity.\nFinally, we study the third case of the closely spaced\nholes, shown in Fig. 1(c). In this case, there exists no\nbifurcation to the asymmetric state and the fundamental\nmode itself is elliptic as shown in the inset of Fig. 5. In\nthe nonlinear case, this elliptic guided mode gives a birth\nto an elliptic spatial soliton controlled by the boundaries\nof the holes. In Fig. 5, we plot the mode eccentricity parameter \u01eb = [1 \u2212 (wx /wy )2 ]1/2 , where wx and wy are the\nmode axes (widths), and thus quantify the transformation of the elliptic guided modes (A) to the elliptic solitons (B) and then to the radially symmetric solitons (C).\nThese results resemble the transformation of the shape\nof nonlinear guided modes in planar waveguides [13].\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that several types\nof two-dimensional spatial optical solitons can be supported by a nonlinear dual-core PCF structure with the\nKerr nonlinearity. We have analyzed numerically the existence and stability of symmetric, antisymmetric, and\nasymmetric nonlinear modes demonstrating that periodic\nrefractive index of PCF provides also an effective stabilization mechanism for these composite localized modes\nto exist in a nonlinear Kerr medium, in a sharp contrast\nwith an entirely homogeneous nonlinear Kerr medium\nwhere spatial solitons are known to be unstable, and they\nundergo the collapse instability. We have studied alloptical switching in the nonlinear dual-core PCF coupler\nassociated with the instability of the symmetric mode.\nThe authors thank Adrian Ankiewicz for useful discussions and acknowledge a partial support of the Australian\nResearch Council.
