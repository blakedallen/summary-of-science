We investigate mid-infrared and X-ray properties of the dusty torus invoked in the unification scenario for active galactic nuclei\nby using the relation between mid IR and hard X-ray luminosities to constrain the geometry and physical state of the dusty torus.\nMethods. We present new VISIR observations of 17 nearby AGN and combined these with our earlier VISIR sample of 8 Seyfert\ngalaxies. After combining these observations with X-ray data from the literature, we studied the correlation between their mid IR and\nhard X-ray luminosities.\nResults. A statistically highly significant correlation is found between the rest frame 12.3 \u03bcm (LMIR ) and 2-10 keV (LX ) luminosities.\nFurthermore, with a probability of 97 %, we find that Sy 1 and Sy 2 nuclei have the same distribution of LMIR over LX .\nConclusions. The high resolution of our MIR imaging allows us to exclude any significant non-torus contribution to the AGN mid IR\ncontinuum, thereby implying that the similarity in the LMIR / LX ratio between Sy 1s and Sy 2s is intrinsic to AGN. We argue that this\nis best explained by clumpy torus models. The slope of the correlation is in good agreement with the expectations from the unified\nscenario and indicates little to no change in the torus geometry with luminosity. In addition, we demonstrate that the high angular\nresolution is crucial for AGN studies in the IR regime.\nKey words. galaxies: active \u2013 Infrared: galaxies \u2013 X-rays: galaxies\n\n1. Introduction\nThe unification model for active galactic nuclei (AGN) interprets the different appearance of Seyfert 1 (Sy1) and Seyfert\n2 (Sy2) galaxies uniquely as the result of an orientation effect\n(Antonucci 1993; Barthel 1994; Urry & Padovani 1996). The\ncentral engine is considered to be surrounded by an optically and\ngeometrically thick molecular torus. Associated with this torus\nare large masses of dust that supposedly reprocess the X-ray and\nUV emission from the accretion disk and re-emit it in the mid\ninfrared (MIR) regime (Pier & Krolik 1993).\nIt is thus very attractive to search for correlations between IR continuum and hard X-ray emission in order to test\nthe unification scenario for AGN. A tight correlation between\nthe 10.5 \u03bcm continuum and the absorption-corrected 2-10 keV\nluminosities for 8 nearby Seyfert galaxies was reported by\nKrabbe et al. (2001) using 1.\u2032\u2032 2 resolution MIR imaging. More\nrecently, Lutz et al. (2004) found a correlation between the rest\nframe 6 \u03bcm luminosity and the absorption-corrected hard X-ray\nluminosity for a sample of 71 AGN. This sample was comprised\nof objects for which 24\u2032\u2032 angular resolution ISOPHOT spectra and hard X-ray observations were available; in particular it\ndoes not contain Compton-thick objects. However, the authors\nreported two problems that the unification scenario faces when\nSend\noffprint\nrequests\nto:\nH.\nHorst,\ne-mail:\nhhorst@astrophysik.uni-kiel.de\n\u22c6\nBased on ESO observing programmes 075.B-0844(C) and 077.B0137(A)\n\ncompared with their observations. (I) The scatter of the relation\nis about an order of magnitude larger than expected from the\nresults of Krabbe et al. (2001). (II) There is no significant difference between type 1 Seyferts (Sy types 1 to 1.5) and type 2\nSeyferts (Sy types 1.8 to 2) objects in the average ratio of midinfrared to hard X-ray emission, as would be expected from an\noptically and geometrically thick as well as smooth torus dominating the mid IR AGN continuum. This was also supported\nby Alonso-Herrero et al. (2002) who investigated the correlation\nbetween the 10 \u03bcm luminosity and the black hole mass of AGN.\nIn an earlier paper (Horst et al. 2006, hereafter Paper I), we\npresented VISIR observations of 8 nearby Seyfert nuclei. With\nour angular resolution of 0.\u2032\u2032 35 at FWHM we then improved\nupon Krabbe et al. (2001) and Lutz et al. (2004) by a factor of 3\nand 80, respectively, thus minimising contributions from extranuclear emission. We found a strong correlation between the rest\nframe 12.3 \u03bcm and 2-10 keV luminosities with type 1 and type 2\n1.60\u00b10.22\nSeyferts following the same correlation of LMIR \u221d LX\n. We\ninterpreted this as a strong indication for the obscuring medium\nto be clumpy rather than smoothly distributed and thus appearing as optically thin in the mid infrared. Moreover, we found the\nslope to be in good agreement with the theoretical predictions by\nBeckert & Duschl (2004).\nHere we present results from our enlarged AGN sample\nwhich contains 21 newly observed objects, out of which 17 were\ndetected with VISIR. Thus, we can now analyse the mid IR and\nhard X-ray properties of 25 objects.\n\n\f2\n\nH.

Target selection and X-ray data\n2.1. Target selection\n\nOur first sample of VISIR targets (see Paper I) was drawn from\nthe sample by Lutz et al. (2004). Our criteria were observability at low airmass from Paranal observatory during ESO period\n75, redshifts below 0.1 and coverage of a wide span of hard\nX-ray luminosities in both type 1 and type 2 objects. For the\npresent work we have revisited the X-ray properties of these objects (see Appendix A) to account for the most recent observations. However, only minor changes had to be applied to the\nluminosities reported in Paper I. The revisited characterisation\nof the sample is given in Table 1. Redshifts z were taken from\nthe NED, Seyfert types are according to V\u00e9ron-Cetty & V\u00e9ron\n(2006) \u2013 with L denoting LINER type AGN \u2013 and the inclination angles i of the host galaxies on the sky were taken from the\nHyperLeda database (Paturel et al. 2003). The last column contains the linear scale on the plane of the sky that is resolved by\nVISIR, computed for an angular resolution of 0.35\u2032\u2032 , which is a\ntypical value for our observations (see Table 3).\nFor our second sample of objects (listed in Table 2), we\nalso selected targets not included in the Lutz et al. sample. We\nbrowsed the literature for relatively nearby AGN (z \u2264 0.1) with\ninferred absorption-corrected hard X-ray luminosities that are\nobservable at low airmass from Paranal observatory during ESO\nperiod 77. An additional criterion was the inclination of the host\ngalaxy toward the plane of the sky. We set the limit at an inclination angle of i = 65\u25e6 in order to avoid viewing the AGN through\nlarge amounts of gas in the host galaxy. Note, that two objects\nfrom our first sample \u2013 NGC 526a and NGC 7314 \u2013 do not meet\nthis requirement.\nFor our target selection we searched the literature for AGN\nwith inferred 2-10 keV luminosities. Observations at different\nepochs were taken as an indicator for the intrinsic variability of\nthe object. This task requires a lot of care as X-ray observations\ncan be of varying quality especially if non-imaging instruments\nare involved. Furthermore, different authors sometimes pursue\ndifferent strategies for fitting the observed data. In general we\ngave higher priority to recent data obtained at the best spatial\nresolution and highest signal-to-noise ratio.

Furthermore we account for a distance uncertainty of 10\n%.\nThe main characteristics of the selected AGN are listed in\nTable 2; a more detailed description of the X-ray properties\nof each object can be found in Appendix A. The classification of all AGN in our sample has been done according to\nV\u00e9ron-Cetty & V\u00e9ron (2006) with the exception of NGC 4303\n(see section 2.2) and Cen A which is listed as a possible BL Lac\nobject but is commonly referred to as an optical type 2 AGN. For\nthe rest of this paper, we summarise Sy types 1.0, 1.2 and 1.5 as\n\"type 1\" and Sy types 1.8, 1.9, 2.0 and 1h (broad lines detected\nin the polarised spectrum) as \"type 2\".\n2.2. Peculiarities of individual objects\n\nWhile for most AGN the type and distance have been unambiguously determined, a few objects show significant discrepancies\nin the literature. Therefore, in the following, we will discuss peculiarities of some individual objects.\nNGC 4303: The nucleus of this object is at the borderline between being a Seyfert 2.0 AGN and a LINER galaxy\n(Filippenko & Sargent 1985). Since it is not evident \u2013 although very likely \u2013 that the nuclear X-ray source is an\nAGN, we adopt the classification as a LINER, in contrast to\nV\u00e9ron-Cetty & V\u00e9ron (2006).\nNGC 4472: This object was erroneously included in our\nsample. An X-ray flux taken from the literature turned out\nto originate in a Ultraluminous X-ray source; the nucleus\nhas not been unambigously detected in the X-rays (but see\nMaccarone et al. 2003).\nCen A: The redshift of Centaurus A is z = 0.001825. In\nour cosmology this corresponds to a luminosity distance of 7.49\nMpc. However, the recessional movement of the galaxy is mostly\npeculiar and not due to the Hubble flow. The best available dis-\n\n\fH. Horst et al.: The mid IR \u2013 hard X-ray correlation in AGN and its implications for dusty torus models\n\ntance estimate toward Cen A is d = 3.84 Mpc. It was derived by\nRejkuba (2004), using two independent methods: The periodluminosity relation for Mira variables and the luminosity of the\ntip of the red giant branch. The uncertainty in Cen A's distance\ntogether with \u2013 by now outdated \u2013 different cosmological parameters have led some authors to overestimate the luminosity\nof this object by more than one order of magnitude.\n3C 445: This Broad Line Radio Galaxy is an interesting case:\nSambruna et al. (1998) and Shinozaki et al. (2006) both invoked\ntwo different absorbing components to fit their respective X-ray\nspectra. Moreover, the ratio of optical reddening to hydrogen\ncolumn density is more than one order of magnitude beneath\nthe galactic value. This indicates an anomalous gas-to-dust ratio\n(Maiolino et al. 2001). The most recent X-ray observations by\nGrandi et al. (2007) and Sambruna et al. (2007), again, indicate\nthe presence of multiple absorbing layers with differing covering\nfactors.\nNGC 7674: NGC 7674 appears to be a Compton-thick AGN\nof high luminosity (see Appendix A for details). Strictly speaking, it does not match our target selection criteria as its intrinsic\nhard X-ray luminosity cannot be inferred with good precision. It\nis, however an interesting test case in order to check whether the\nMIR \u2013 hard X-ray correlation holds for Compton-thick objects.\nNGC 7679: Another interesting object; being of Seyfert type\n1.9 (broad H\u03b1 line but no broad H\u03b2 ) one would expect the X-ray\nspectrum to show a low-energy cutoff typical for absorbed systems. However, in their analysis Della Ceca et al. (2001) found\nNGC 7679 to appear as a Seyfert 1 in X-rays. Moreover, they\nfound evidence for a starburst in the nucleus of this object.\n\n3. Observations and data analysis\nOur first sample of objects was observed between April and\nAugust 2005; details on observing conditions can be found in\nPaper I. The second sample was observed one year later, between April and August 2006. We used the standard imaging\ntemplate of VISIR, with parallel chopping and nodding and a\nchop throw of 8\u2032\u2032 . In order to get the best possible angular resolution, the small field camera (0.\u2032\u2032 075 / pixel) was used. Bright\nAGN were observed in three filters in order to allow a reconstruction of their spectral energy distribution (SED) in the MIR.\nDue to time constraints, faint objects could only be observed in\none filter. All observations were executed in service mode with\nrequired observing conditions of clear sky and 0.\u2032\u2032 8 seeing or less.\nThe average airmass was 1.15, with no observation being executed at an airmass above 1.3. Science targets and photometric\nstandards were all observed within 2 h of each other and with a\nmaximum difference in airmass of 0.25. For most observations,\nhowever, differences in both time and airmass are much smaller\nthan these values.\nSome exposures had to be re-executed due to changing atmospheric conditions. In these cases, for each object only the data\nobtained under the best conditions were used for our subsequent\nanalysis. A log of these observations is given in Table 3.\nWe reduced science and standard star frames using the\npipeline written by Eric Pantin (private communication) for the\nVISIR consortium. To eliminate glitches, the pipeline applies a\nbad pixel mask and removes detector stripes. Subsequently we\nremoved background variations using a 2 dimensional polynomial fit. For objects observed in unstable conditions we treated\neach nodding cycle separately as the background pattern sometimes changed between two consecutive cycles. The count rate\nfor one full exposure was calculated as the mean of all 3 beams\nfrom all nodding cycles of this exposure. As an error estimate\n\n3\n\nwe use the standard deviation of these. In order to minimise the\neffect of residual sky background we chose relatively small apertures (\u2248 10 pixels = 1.\u2032\u2032 27) for the photometry and corrected the\nobtained count rates using the radial profiles of standard stars.\nFinally we calibrated our photometry using the same standard\nstars. The conversion factor counts/s / Jy proved to be very stable: for each individual filter, variations were less than 10 % over\nthe whole observing period.\n\n4. Results\n4.1. Mid IR properties\n\nOut of the 21 AGN observed with VISIR, 17 were detected. They\nare all point-like which means the torus remains unresolved. For\nthe 4 non detected objects 3\u03c3 upper limits were derived by measuring the flux of the largest noise-induced signal and assuming the same PSF as measured for the standard stars. In Table 3\nthe flux or flux limit and size of the PSF is listed for each object. For sources observed in three filters, we were able to reconstruct their MIR SEDs. For a few objects we find indications for\nthe presence of the 9.7 \u03bcm feature, either in emission or in absorption. Looking at our own data and comparing with archival\nSpitzer spectra, we find that in all cases, at wavelengths longer\nthan 12 \u03bcm, the feature hardly affects the observed flux level.\nPossible contamination will be well below 10 %.\nIn addition to the central point source, in three sources \u2013\nNGC 1097, NGC 5135, NGC 7469 \u2013 we observed clear extranuclear MIR emission. In all of these objects we find distinct\nblobs of star formation (SF), in addition NGC 5135 and NGC\n7469 also exhibit a weak diffuse component. Typical distances\nbetween SF blobs and the AGN are 8.\u2032\u2032 2 (\u223c 700 pc) in NGC\n1097, 1.\u2032\u2032 5 (\u223c 400 pc) in NGC 5135 and 1.\u2032\u2032 3 (\u223c 400 pc) in NGC\n7469. In the latter two objects the proximity of the SF components to the AGN does not allow to rule out a significant contribution of SF to the measured flux of the central point source. By\ncomparing the fluxes of individual SF blobs and of the AGN, we\ncan estimate upper limits for such contamination. This yields 15\n% for NGC 5135 and 10 % for NGC 7469. These uncertainties\nhave been added to the photometric error and are accounted for\nin our subsequent statistical analysis.\nDetails on the morphologies and SEDs of all observed objects will be presented in a forthcoming paper. We should, however, point out that the chopping/nodding technique used for the\nobservations would automatically cancel a contribution from a\nsmooth and diffuse component extending over an area similar to\nthe chopping/nodding throw.\n4.2. The mid IR \u2013 hard X-ray correlation\n\nIn order to analyse the correlation between intrinsic hard X-ray\nand mid infrared luminosity, for each object we have taken the\nphotometry done closest to our reference wavelength of 12.3 \u03bcm\nin rest frame and then converted to said wavelength by assuming\nthe SED to be flat in this part of the spectrum. This wavelength\nwas chosen as it is close to the peak of the MIR SED in AGN\nand, in addition, is only affected by emission or absorption in one\nof the silicate features at 9.7 \u03bcm and 18 \u03bcm if these are particularly strong. Fortunately, there is no indication for such strong\nsilicate features in any observed SED.\nThe resulting monochromatic luminosity is plotted versus\nthe intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity in Fig. 1. The correlation between these two quantities is of high statistical significance;\nafter excluding non-detections and Compton-thick objects, the\n\n\f4\n\nH.

The latter agrees well with the results of the earlier studies by Krabbe et al. (2001) and Lutz et al.\n(2004).\nOne concern with correlations between luminosities is that\nthey may be caused by a redshift bias in the data. We tested for\nthis possibility in two ways. First of all, we analysed the formal\ncorrelation between MIR and hard X-ray fluxes. The resulting\nSpearman rank coefficient is \u03c1 = 0.52 at a significance level of\n0.01. This means that the correlation is rather weak but, nevertheless, highly significant. Secondly, we tried to reproduce the\nobserved correlation between luminosities with randomly generated mock data. For this, we assumed X-ray and MIR flux values\nto be uniformly distributed over the range of observed ones, for\nthe distances we tried both a uniform and a normal distribution\nwith no significant change in the result: After generating 104\nmock datasets, a rank coefficient of \u03c1 > 0.89 for the MIR \u2013 hard\nX-ray correlation was found with a frequency of less than 0.1\n%, a significance level of less than 7.4 \u00d7 10\u22129 with a frequency\nof less than 0.15 %. The combination of both results \u2013 the high\nsignificance of the flux \u2013 flux correlation and the low probability\nof reproducing the obserevd luminosity \u2013 luminosity correlation\nwith non-correlated data \u2013 implies that we can safely assume the\ncorrelation to be real and not caused by a redshift bias in our\ndata.\nIn Fig. 2 we show the luminosity ratio LMIR /LX vs the intrinsic column density NH toward the AGN. There is no correlation discernible between the two displayed quantities. Neither\ndo we find a significant dependence of the luminosity ratio on\nSeyfert type: log LMIR \u2212 log LX is (0.38 \u00b1 0.31) for type 1s,\n(0.44 \u00b1 0.45) for type 2s and (0.61 \u00b1 0.17) for the three detected LINERs in our sample. We tested for a possible depen-\n\n5\n\nFig. 2. Luminosity ratio LMIR /LX vs intrinsic column density\nNH . Symbols and colours are as in Fig. 1.

With a result of \u03c1 = 0.13 at\na significance level of 0.54, we find no evidence for a correlation between the two quantities. Furthermore, we performed\na Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for the luminosity ratios of type 1\nand type 2 Seyferts. The maximum difference in the cumulative distribution function is 0.2 and the significance level 0.97\nwhich means both samples very likely originate from the same\nparent distribution. These numbers confirm the result from our\nfirst study that type 1s and type 2s follow the same LMIR \u2212 LX\ncorrelation and have the same average luminosity ratio.\n\n5. Discussion\n5.1. Contamination\n\nA potential problem for our study is contamination by extranuclear emission. This is primarily important in the mid infrared.\nAGN of moderate to high luminosities should always dominate\ntheir hosts in the 2-10 keV band. In the mid infrared, on the other\nhand, star formation and also Narrow Line Region (NLR) clouds\ncan significantly contribute to the total flux.\nFirst of all, the high angular resolution (see Tables 1 and 2\nfor the physical scales we resolve) cuts away most of the star formation. The off-nuclear emission we find in three of our objects\n(see section 4.1) is at distances from the AGN that are resolved\neven in the most distant objects of our sample. Therefore, we are\nconfident that emission from SF regions does not heavily affect\nour measurements.\nThe NLR, however, remains unresolved in most of our\nsources. The case of NGC 1068 shows that this may be\na problem, as very accurate MIR photometry of this object\n(Galliano et al. 2005) show the NLR clouds to contribute almost\n50 % of the nuclear MIR emission. Fortunately, three of our detected sources, namely NGC 4579, NGC 1097 and, most importantly, Cen A, are at comparable or even smaller distances\nthan NGC 1068 and do not show any additional nuclear com-\n\n\f6\n\nH. Horst et al.: The mid IR \u2013 hard X-ray correlation in AGN and its implications for dusty torus models\n\n5.2. Is the torus clumpy or smooth?\n\nFig. 3. Luminosity ratio LMIR /LX vs resolved physical scale in\nunits of rsub . Symbols and colours are as in Fig. 1. As in Fig.\n2, Compton-thick objects are displayed as red arrows and MIR\nnon-detections have been omitted. The vertical dashed line indicates a resolution of 560 * rsub above which the luminosity ratio\nrises.\n\nponents. In order to test whether less well resolved sources are\naffected by extra-nuclear emission, in Fig. 3 we have plotted the\nMIR / X-ray luminosity ratio over the resolved physical scale,\nexpressed in units of the dust sublimation radius rsub \u221d L1/2\nbol .\nWe here assume the accretion disc's bolometric luminosity to\nbe Lbol = 10 * LX which is a typical value for Seyfert galaxies\n(Vasudevan & Fabian 2007). Interestingly, for observations for\nwhich the size of the PSF at FWHM (in pc) is less than 560 * rsub,\nthere is no case with LMIR /LX > 0.4, while this is the case for all\nbut two objects with FWHM (pc) > 560rsub . The mean luminosity ratios for the well resolved and the less well resolved sources\nare (0.11 \u00b1 0.19) and (0.65 \u00b1 0.27), respectively. This rise indicates that some of our less well resolved sources are, indeed,\naffected by contamination, despite our high angular resolution.\nWe have, therefore, recalculated the mid IR \u2013 hard X-ray\ncorrelation, only using well resolved objects with FWHM (pc) /\nrsub \u2264 560 (encircled objects in Fig. 1). The resulting log LMIR =\n(\u22123.89 \u2213 3.68) + (1.09 \u00b1 0.09) log LX is in very good agreement\nwith the correlation found for the whole sample. This method allows us to say with some confidence that objects situated close to\nthis fit (dashed line in Fig. 1) are not affected by contamination.\nInterestingly, for the well resolved sources we find the correlation between the measured fluxes to be much stronger than for\nthe complete sample. Its Spearman rank is \u03c1 = 0.92 and the significance level = 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 . This is another indication that these\nfluxes are mostly free of contamination.\nThe SF region we find in three of our objects and also Fig.\n3 illustrate the need for high angular resolution MIR studies for\ntesting AGN models. Even using 8m-class telescopes, a good\nsample selection is crucial to avoid contamination by non-AGN\nemission. Furthermore, this indicates that the high scatter in the\nmid IR \u2013 hard X-ray correlation found by Lutz et al. (2004)\nmay, indeed, be caused by the poor angular resolution of their\nISOPHOT data.\nDespite the difference in slope we have found in Paper I, we\nagain find NGC 4579 \u2013 the object we had excluded from the\npower-law fit in our first study \u2013 to lie off the correlation (see\nFig. 1).\n\nThere has been a long-going debate over whether the matter in\nthe obscuring tori in AGN is distributed smoothly (Pier & Krolik\n1992) or arranged in clumps (Krolik & Begelman 1988). In\nPaper I we argued that type 1 and type 2 nuclei having the same\nLMIR /LX ratio, is a strong argument for the torus to be clumpy.\nThis point is strengthened by our current study not only due to\nthe improved number statistics but also due to the larger range of\ncolumn densities we probe. As discussed in section 4.2, the ratio LMIR /LX shows no dependence on NH \u2013 and so over 4 orders\nof magnitude in NH (see Fig. 2). Even the two Compton-thick\nobjects in our sample, NGC 5135 and NGC 7674 seem to have\nroughly the same value of LMIR /LX as the rest of our sample. For\nthese objects, however, strong conclusions cannot be drawn, as\ntheir X-ray luminosities can only be estimated to an uncertainty\nof one order or magnitude.\nFor an optically thick smooth torus, a much higher LMIR /LX\nis expected for Sy 1s than for Sy 2s. Pier & Krolik (1993) expect\na difference of one order of magnitude for a change of NH from\n\u223c 1020 cm\u22122 to \u223c 1024 cm\u22122 . The reason for this is that in Sy\n2s the observer sees the emission from the cold dust in the outer\npart of the torus, while in Sy 1s one can see its hot inner part as\nwell. This prediction is not compatible with our results.\nIt is important to note that the similarity between Sy types\nstill holds if we only regard objects with FWHM (pc) / rsub \u2264\n560. For these we find log LMIR \u2212 log LX to be (0.15 \u00b1 0.15)\nfor type 1s and (0.07 \u00b1 0.25) for type 2s.\nModels of clumpy tori (Nenkova et al. 2002;\nDullemond & van Bemmel 2005; H\u00f6nig et al. 2006) do not\npredict a difference in LMIR /LX between different Sy types.\nIn particular, H\u00f6nig et al. (2006), using 3D radiative transfer\nmodelling, showed that clumpy tori can appear as optically\nthin in the MIR with most of the radiation originating in the\ninnermost part of the torus. In their model individual clouds\nare optically thick but their volume filling factor is small.\nOur observational results clearly prefer this kind of models to\nsmooth ones.\nRecently, Ramos DAlmeida et al. (2007)\nE reported to have\nfound a difference in log L6.75\u03bcm \u2212 log LX between type 1 and\ntype 2 objects. For their analysis, they use ISOCAM data first\npublished by Clavel et al. (2000) and the X-ray data that was\ncompiled by Lutz et al. (2004). Despite the brightness profile decomposition Ramos Almeida et al. (2007) performed their data\nmay still be heavily contaminated by nuclear star formation.\nAmong our own data, in the two cases of NGC 5135 and NGC\n7469 we find that within 3\u2032\u2032 from the nucleus, SF contributes at\nleast 43 % and 45 % of the total flux at 12.3 \u03bcm, respectively.\nAlso the fact that the luminosity ratios Ramos Almeida et al.\n(2007) derive are \u223c 8 larger than what we find for our well resolved objects \u2013 and despite their shorter observing wavelength\nin the IR \u2013 indicates that they are probably affected by contamination and the MIR fluxes they report are likely not dominated\nby torus emission.\n5.3. The slope of the correlation and the shape of the torus\n\nAs the mid IR radiation is accretion disc emission reproduced by\nthe dusty torus, LMIR and LX are directly linked to each other via\nthe covering factor fC of the torus:\n\nLMIR \u221d fC LX .\n\n(1)\n\n\fH.

Thus, while in principle,\nour approach is well suited to test these predictions, our current\nsample is not sufficient for this task. Future observations are required to test down to what luminosities the classic picture of\nAGN can be applied.\n\n6. Conclusions\n\nFig. 4. Luminosity ratio LMIR /LX , plotted over LX . Colours and\nsymbols are as in Fig. 1. Black circles mark well resolved\nsources with FWHM(pc) / rsub \u2264 560 (see section 5.1 and Fig.\n3).\n\n0.04\u00b10.04\nThus, our best-fit result implies fC \u221d LX\n. This means\nthat we do not find any dependence of LMIR /LX on LX which is\nalso illustrated by Fig. 4. This result does not match the expectations from the receding torus model (Lawrence 1991) for which\nSimpson (2005) found the fraction of type 2 AGN f2 to depend\non AGN luminosity as f2 \u221d L\u22120.27\nfor LX & L0 \u2248 7\u00d71043 erg s\u22121 .\nX\nThe basic assumption of the unified scenario is that f2 \u2248 fC . The\ndependence derived by Simpson would, thus, yield a correlation\nfC \u221d L\u22120.27\nwhich disagrees with the slope we find by more than\nX\n7\u03c3. Note, however, that we do not probe the Quasar regime of\nluminosities, i.e. for a break luminosity L0 & 1045 erg s\u22121 the\nreceding torus model would, again, agree with our results.\nOne possibility to reconcile our findings with the obvious dependence of the type 1 fraction on AGN luminosities\n(Simpson 2005, and references therein) would be that a significant number of Compton-thick AGN at moderate luminosities\n(L2\u221210keV = 1043 \u223c 1044 erg s\u22121 ) have been missed in hitherto existing X-ray surveys. The existence of a population of Comptonthick AGN has also been suggested by X-ray surveys (e.g. the\nCOSMOS survey, Hasinger et al. 2007), X-ray background synthesis (e.g. Gilli et al. 2007; Gandhi et al. 2007) and IR surveys (Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Sansigre et al. 2005). Very recently, Ueda et al.\n(2007) randomly selected two AGN out of those first detected\nby Swift to be observed with Suzaku and found both of them to\nbe highly obscured. This is anoter indication for the existence\nof a large population of Compton-thick AGN at moderate luminosities.\n\nWe have presented new high resolution mid infrared photometry\nof 17 AGN, increasing our total sample to 25 detected and 4\nnon-detected objects. We have found angular resolution to be a\ncrucial requirement for our study as poorly resolved sources can\nbe heavily contaminated by non-AGN emission in the mid IR\nband.\nThe rest frame 12.3 \u03bcm luminosities LMIR of our well resolved sources strongly correlate with their rest frame 2-10 keV\nluminosities LX , matching the expectations from the unified scenario for AGN. With a probability of 97 %, type 1 and type 2\nSeyferts have the same distribution of LMIR /LX . This similarity\nis most probably intrinsic to the AGN and not caused by extranuclear emission contaminating the MIR flux. These results have\ntwo important implications:\n\u2013 As we do not find the offset in LMIR /LX between type 1s\nand type 2s, predicted by smooth torus models, AGN tori\nare likely to be clumpy. The volume filling factor of these\nclumps has to be small in order to reproduce our results.\n\u2013 At a 7\u03c3 level, the slope of the correlation is not compatible\nwith the predictions of the receding torus model by Simpson\n(2005). We suggest that the break luminosity for this model\nis higher than hitherto assumed. A population of Compton\nthick AGN at moderate luminosities being missed in current\nX-ray surveys could resolve this problem.\nThe question, whether AGN at low luminosities, with Lbol <\n1042 erg s\u22121 have a qualitatively different appearance than objects of higher luminosities, remains open. Fortunately, we have\nrecently been awarded time to observe a sample of 14 heavily\nobscured (NH = 1024 \u223c 1025 cm\u22122 ), mostly low luminosity AGN\nwith VISIR which may help to shed light on this issue.\nAcknowledgements.

Tori at low luminosities?\n\nIn paper I we found some indications that a different physical\nmechanism, other than re-radiation of the accretion disk emission, is dominating the MIR emission in AGN with L2\u221210keV <\n1042 erg s\u22121 . This matches theoretical predictions that have been\npublished subsequently. Interestingly, the very different models\nby Elitzur & Shlosman (2006) and H\u00f6nig & Beckert (2007) both\npredict the collapse of the torus below Lbol \u2248 1042 erg s\u22121 . In\nour new sample, however, the indications for this effect are less\npronounced. We do see a tendency for objects with low X-ray\nluminosities to depart from the MIR \u2013 hard X-ray correlation,\n\nReferences\nAlonso-Herrero, A., Ivanov, V.

X-ray data for the P75 sample\n\nFairall 9: With XMM-Newton, Gondoin et al. (2001) measured a\nhard X-ray flux of F2\u221210keV = (1.56 \u00b1 0.33) \u00d7 10\u221211 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 .\nFrom the compilation of earlier measurements shown in their\npaper, we can estimate the peak-to-peak variability / uncertainty\nto be of the order of 2. Yaqoob & Padmanabhan (2004) report\na flux of F2\u221210keV = 2.2 \u00d7 10\u221211 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 ., obtained with\nChandra. Within errors, this is still consistent with Gondoin et\nal.'s measurement. From these fluxes and the reported hydrogen\ncolumn density of NH = (3.0 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 , we calculate a\nluminosity of L2\u221210keV = 7.43 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121 .\nNGC 526A: For this object, unfortunately, no observations\nwith Chandra or XMM-Newton have been published. Using\nBeppoSAX, Landi et al. (2001) measured F2\u221210keV = 1.8 \u00d7 10\u221211\nerg s\u22121 cm\u22122 , absorbed by NH = (1.33 \u00b1 0.15) \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 .\nAnother observation of NGC 526A with the RXTE satellite\nhas been performed by Revnivtsev et al. (2004). Extrapolating\ntheir 2-9 keV count rate yields F2\u221210keV = 2.7 \u00d7 10\u221211 erg s\u22121\ncm\u22122 . Both observations are consistent with each other if we\nassume an uncertainty of 0.2 dex. The resulting luminosity is\nL2\u221210keV = 1.37 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121 .\nNGC 3783: This object was observed with XMM-Newton\nby Blustin et al. (2002) who report an intrinsic flux of F2\u221210kev =\n8.5 \u00d7 10\u221211 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 which corresponds to L2\u221210kev = 1.61 \u00d7\n1043 erg s\u22121 . The galactic absorption toward NGC 3783 is NH =\n8.7\u00d71020 cm\u22122 . The intrinsic warm absorption can be ignored for\nour purpose as it hardly affects the 2-10 keV band. Variability of\nthis source is indicated by comparing the flux given above to the\nobs\none reported by Malizia et al. (1997) (F2\u221210keV\n= 4.09\u00d710\u221210 erg\n\u22121\ns ) which is about five times higher. Due to the higher quality\nof their data, we will use the results from Blustin et al. (2002)\nand allow for a variability / uncertainty of 0.3 dex.\nNGC 4579: This object has been observed multiple times\n(Terashima et al. 1998; Ho et al. 2001; Dewangan et al. 2004;\nCappi et al. 2006) with most of the results being in good agreement with each other. We here adopt the results of Cappi et\nal. \u2013 L2\u221210keV = 1.26 \u00d7 1041 erg s\u22121 , NH \u2264 2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 \u2013\n\n\fH. Horst et al.: The mid IR \u2013 hard X-ray correlation in AGN and its implications for dusty torus models\n\nwhich were obtained with XMM-Newton. The luminosity stated\nby Dewangan et al. (2004) is lower by factor of 10. This, however, seems to be a typographical error as all measured fluxes\nare consistent. A statistical uncertainty of 0.3 dex is assumed\nto account for the different results on L2\u221210keV among the other\nauthors.\nNGC 4593: The two most reliable data sets for this object are\nfrom Reynolds et al. (2004) and Shinozaki et al. (2006), both obtained with XMM-Newton. They agree within errors. We adopt\nthe values provided by Shinozaki et al.: NH = 1.69 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122\nand L2\u221210keV = 8.60 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121 . Steenbrugge et al. (2003) observed NGC 4593 with both XMM-Newton and Chandra. While\nthe Chandra result (L2\u221210keV = 8.91 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121 ) is in good\nagreement with the one cited above, the luminosity measured\nwith XMM-Newton was higher (L2\u221210keV = 1.2 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121 ).\nThis may be due to intrinsic variability of the source. We can\naccount for this with an uncertainty of 0.4 dex.\nPKS 2048-57: Risaliti et al. (2002), observing with ASCA,\ninferred NH = (2.37 \u00b1 0.20) \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122 and F2\u221210keV = 2.65 \u00d7\n10\u221211 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 , the latter yielding L2\u221210keV = 6.88 \u00d7 1042\nerg s\u22121 . An independent analysis of archival ASCA data by\nHeckman et al. (2005) yields L2\u221210keV = 2.88\u00d71042 erg s\u22121 , after\nconversion to our Cosmology. These results are consistent if we\nconsider variability of the source: Georgantopoulos & Papadakis\n(2001) report a flux variation by a factor of almost two within\none week of observation. For our study we use the results by\nRisaliti et al., allowing for a luminosity uncertainty of 0.4 dex.\nPG 2130+099: Lawson & Turner (1997) find this object to\nbe unabsorbed and emit F2\u221210keV = 5.3 \u00d7 10\u221212 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122\nand thus L2\u221210keV = 4.50 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121 . More recently, Gallo\n(2006) observed PG 2130+099 with XMM-Newton and obtained\nF2.5\u221210 = 0.31 \u00d7 10\u221211 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 . Using the luminosity value\nfrom Lawson & Turner and assume an uncertainty of 0.4 dex,\nthis is in good agreement with Gallo's result.\nNGC 7314: This object was observed with XMM-Newton\nby Shinozaki et al. (2006). After converting their result to our\nCosmology, we get L2\u221210keV = 1.5 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121 and a column density of NH = (7.2 \u00b1 1) \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 . Older observations\nby Malizia et al. (1997); Turner et al. (1997); Risaliti (2002);\nRisaliti et al. (2002) and Kraemer et al. (2004) are in good agreement with these numbers if one accounts for the different cosmological parameters used.\nA.2. X-ray data for the P77 sample\n\nMCG-01-01-43: This object was observed with ASCA by\n20\nTurner et al. (1997). They report NH = 3.27+2.74\ncm\u22122\n\u22120.0 \u00d7 10\nand a luminosity that \u2013 corrected for the different Cosmologies\nused \u2013 translates to L2\u221210keV = 3.5 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121 . This measurement is backed up by INTEGRAL observations (Ebisawa et al.\n2003) where JEM-X measures F3\u221210keV = 1.55 \u00d7 1012 erg s\u22121\ncm\u22122 . This yields L3\u221210keV = 2.84 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121 .\nMrk 590: With XMM-Newton, Gallo et al. (2006) estimated a 2-10 keV luminosity which, in our Cosmology, yields\nL2\u221210keV = 6.6 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121 . This is in good agreement\nwith the results of a combined Chandra and XMM-Newton\nprogramme by Longinotti et al. (2007) (L2\u221210keV = 8.9 \u00d7 1042\nerg s\u22121 ). Shinozaki et al. (2006), on the other hand, having observed Mrk 590 with XMM-Newton as well, report a luminosity of L2\u221210keV = 4.1 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121 (after conversion to our\nCosmology). Here, we will use Longinnotti et al.'s result and\nallow for an uncertainty of 0.5 dex.\nNGC 1097: Iyomoto et al. (1996) observed this object with\n21\nASCA and retrieved NH = 1.3+0.4\ncm\u22122 and F2\u221210keV =\n\u22120.3 \u00d7 10\n\n9\n\n1.7 \u00d7 10\u221212 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 , the latter corresponding to L2\u221210keV =\n6.18 \u00d7 1040 erg s\u22121 . Nemmen et al. (2006) observed NGC 1097\n20\ncm\u22122 and\nwith Chandra and report NH = 2.3+2.8\n\u22121.7 \u00d7 10\n\u221212\n\u22121\n\u22122\nF2\u221210keV = 1.73\u00d710 erg s cm . We will adopt these results\nfor our analysis.\nNGC 4303: This low-luminosity AGN was observed by\nJim\u00e9nez-Bail\u00f3n et al. (2003), using the Chandra telescope. The\nnuclear source does not show intrinsic absorption, thus the galactic value of NH = 1.67 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 is adopted. The unabsorbed\n\u221214\nerg s\u22121 cm\u22122 . This corresponds\nflux is F2\u221210keV = 2.6+1.0\n\u22120.8 \u00d7 10\nto a luminosity of L2\u221210keV = 1.44 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 . Note, that\nJim\u00e9nez-Bail\u00f3n et al. (2003) cannot exclude the possibility that\nthe nuclear X-ray source of NGC 4303 is a binary system instead\nof an AGN. They come, however, to the conclusion that this is\nunlikely.\nNGC 4472: This object, unfortunately, has not been detected\nin the hard X-ray band so far. The most stringent upper limit\nto its flux is from Panessa et al. (2006): F2\u221210keV \u2264 6.6 \u00d7 10\u221214\nerg s\u22121 cm\u22122 . The corresponding luminosity limit is L2\u221210keV \u2264\n1.48 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 . This is in agreement with the 3\u03c3 detection in the soft band by Soldatenkov et al. (2003) who measured\nL0.5\u22122.5keV = 1.7\u00d71038 erg s\u22121 . Whether this source is dominated\nby a star-burst or suffers from Compton-thick absorption is still\nunder investigation.\nNGC 4507: For this object the estimates for the hydrogen\ncolumn density vary significantly. An average value is the one\nestimated by Bassani et al. (1999): NH = (2.92 \u00b1 0.23) \u00d7 1023\ncm\u22122 . The resulting absorption-corrected flux is F2\u221210keV =\n7.03 \u00d7 10\u221211 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 . This yields L2\u221210keV = 2.0 \u00d7 1043 erg\ns\u22121 ; we assume an uncertainty of 0.3 dex \u2013 this also matches the\nvariability observed by Georgantopoulos & Papadakis (2001).\nNGC 4698: Three Chandra observations of this object have\nbeen published, by Cappi et al. (2006); Gonz\u00e1lez-Mart\u0131\u0301n et al.\n(2006) and Panessa et al. (2006). Cappi et al. report NH \u2264 4 \u00d7\n1021 cm\u22122 and L2\u221210keV = 1.59 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 . If we use the\ndistance to NGC 4698 from Tully (1988) which was also used\nby Cappi et al. the flux measurements by Panessa et al. and\nGonz\u00e1lez-Mart\u0131\u0301n et al. yield L2\u221210keV = 1.54 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 and\nL2\u221210keV = 4.90 \u00d7 1038 erg s\u22121 , respectively. As all three observations seem to be of comparable quality we adopt a mean\nluminosity of L2\u221210keV = 1.21 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 and an uncertainty\nof 0.6 dex.\nNGC 4941: Maiolino et al. (1998) present BeppoSAX obser23\nvations of this object. Their best fit results are NH = 4.5+2.5\n\u22121.4 \u00d710\n\u22122\n41\n\u22121\ncm and L2\u221210keV \u2248 2 \u00d7 10 erg s . Risaliti (2002) complements the BeppoSAX data with ASCA observations. From\nthese he draws the conclusion that the absorbing column is actually Compton-thick. Terashima et al. (2002) also find NH \u223c 1024\ncm\u22122 and attribute the difference between their and Maiolino et\nal.'s result to variability of the absorbing column. We therefore\nconsider the uncertainty of Maiolino et al.'s result to be large and\nassume 0.6 dex for the luminosity.\nIRAS 13197-1627: The most recent X-ray observation, using XMM-Newton is by Miniutti et al. (2007b). They report a\nhydrogen column density of NH = (3.9 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122 . If\nwe convert the absorption-corrected luminosity they infer to our\nCosmology we get L2\u221210keV = (0.6 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121 . Miniutti\net al. also estimate the true intrinsic luminosity of the AGN by\nmultiplying the reflection fraction. After correcting for the dif43\nferent Cosmologies it is Lint\nerg s\u22121 .\n2\u221210keV = (3.9 \u00b1 2.6) \u00d7 10\nThe first value is also consistent with L2\u221210keV = 0.37 \u00d7 1043 erg\ns\u22121 as resulting from the flux reported by Bassani et al. (1999) \u2013\neven though these authors assumed a much higher column den-\n\n\f10\n\nH. Horst et al.: The mid IR \u2013 hard X-ray correlation in AGN and its implications for dusty torus models\n\nsity of NH = (7.6 \u00b1 1.3) \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122 . For our further analysis\nwe will adopt Miniutti et al.'s absorption-corrected luminosity\nL2\u221210keV and take the conservative assumption of an uncertainty\nof 0.4 dex.\nCen A: Observations with Chandra and XMM-Newton by\nEvans et al. (2004) yield an absorbing column of NH \u2248 1023\ncm\u22122 and an intrinsic luminosity of L2\u221210keV = 4.80\u00d71041 erg s\u22121\nwith a peak-to-peak variability by a factor of . 2. This is consistent with older estimates by Grandi et al. (2003) (F2\u221210kev =\n3.8 \u00d7 10\u221210 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 , yielding L2\u221210keV = 6.71 \u00d7 1041 erg s\u22121 )\nand Risaliti (2002) (NH \u2248 9 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 ). We adopt the luminosity from Evans et al. and the absorbing column density from\nRisaliti.\nNGC 5135: Levenson et al. (2004) observed NGC 5135 with\nChandra. They find NH > 1024 cm\u22122 . From the flux of the Iron\nK\u03b1 line they estimate the intrinsic hard X-ray luminosity to be\nL2\u221210keV \u2248 1 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121 . To account for the high uncertainty\nof the luminosity estimate, we will set it to 1.0 dex.\nMCG-06-30-15: This source has been extensively studied\ndue to its prominent, relativistically-broadened Iron K\u03b1 line\n(e.g. Tanaka et al. 1989; Fabian et al. 2003). A dusty warm absorber with an equivalent neutral column density of a few \u00d71021\ncm\u22122 is known to be present (Reynolds et al. 1997; Lee et al.\n2001). Extrapolating the latest 3\u201345 keV Suzaku X-ray data\n(Miniutti et al. 2007a) to 2\u201310 keV results in an intrinsic powerlaw luminosity of L2\u221210keV = 3.7 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121 . The source is\nknown to vary significantly; we have thus used time-averaged\nmeasurements for the above calculation, and also assign a variability / uncertainty of 0.4 dex. This is also consistent with an\nINTEGRAL/JEM-X measurement by Beckmann et al. (2006).\nNGC 5995: This object was observed by Panessa & Bassani\n21\n(2002), using the ASCA satellite. They find NH = 9.0+0.5\n\u22120.3 \u00d7 10\n\u22122\ncm and (after conversion to our Cosmology) L2\u221210keV = 3.48 \u00d7\n1043 erg s\u22121 .\nESO 141-G55: This object was observed with XMM-Newton\nby Gondoin et al. (2003). They find the absorption to be Galactic\nwith NH = 5.5 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 . After we correct the luminosity they\ndetermine for the slightly different redshift and cosmological parameters we use, we end up with L2\u221210keV = 8.01 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121 .\nMrk 509: Shinozaki et al. (2006) observed this AGN with\nXMM-Newton and find an intrinsic absorption of NH < 4.8\u00d71020\ncm\u22122 and (after correcting for slightly different Cosmology and\nredshift) L2\u221210keV = 1.3 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 . A Chandra observation\nby Yaqoob & Padmanabhan (2004) yields compatible results.\nNGC 7172: Intrinsic luminosity and column density estimates for this source show a surprising range of variation. From\nBeppoSAX observations, Dadina (2007) infers NH = 1.1 \u00d7 1021\ncm\u22122 (although this seems to be underestimated by a factor of\n100 due to a typographical error) and F2\u221210keV = 8.9 \u00d7 10\u221212 erg\ns\u22121 cm\u22122 , yielding L2\u221210keV = 1.33 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121 . Awaki et al.\n(2006) on the other hand report NH = (8.3 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122\nand L2\u221210keV = 5.8 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121 . Risaliti et al. (2002) compiled\nobservations of NGC 7172 that had been executed between 1985\nand 1997. Column densities range between (7 \u223c 11) \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122\nand absorption corrected fluxes between (0.9 \u223c 7.7) \u00d7 10\u221211 erg\ns\u22121 cm\u22122 with a weak trend toward lower fluxes with time. For\nour study we adopt the results of Awaki et al. as they are intermediate ones. A high variability of NGC 7172 in the hard Xray band has been observed by Georgantopoulos & Papadakis\n(2001) who report a flux variation by a factor of \u223c 6 within one\nweek of observation. To account for this we set the uncertainty\nto 0.8 dex.\nNGC 7213: This object has been observed repeatedly by\nX-ray satellites. The most recent results have been reported by\n\nStarling et al. (2005) from XMM-Newton observations (Galactic\nNH = 2.04 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 , L2\u221210keV = 1.7 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121 ),\nZhou & Wang (2005), reanalysing archival XMM-Newton data\n(L2\u221210keV = 1.68 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121 and Bianchi et al. (2004) who\nperformed simultaneous observations with XMM-Newton and\nBeppoSAX (NH = 2.04 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 , L2\u221210keV = 1.72 \u00d7 1042\nerg s\u22121 ). The agreement of these studies is very good. We will\nuse the arithmetic mean of these three luminosity estimates.\n3C 445: The three most recent observations of 3C 445 were\nall carried out with XMM-Newton; Shinozaki et al. (2006) mea23\nsured NH = 1.32+0.1\ncm\u22122 and \u2013 in our Cosmology \u2013\n\u22120.2 \u00d7 10\n44\n\u22121\nL2\u221210keV = 2.6 \u00d7 10 erg s . Grandi et al. (2007) find NH =\n23\n\u22122\n4+3\nand an unabsorbed flux of F2\u221210keV = 1.7\u00d710\u221211\n\u22122 \u00d710 cm\n\u22121\n\u22122\nerg s cm which translates to 1.2 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 . The observa23\n\u22122\ntions by Sambruna et al. (2007) yield NH = 2.25+0.62\n\u22120.43 \u00d710 cm\nand, after conversion to our Cosmology, L2\u221210keV = 8.1 \u00d7 1043\nerg s\u22121 . Given the complexity of the source, these numbers agree\nvery well. We therefore use the mean values.\nNGC\n7469:\nFrom\nXMM-Newton\nobservations\nZhou & Wang (2005) derive a luminosity of L2\u221210keV =\n1.29 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121 . NGC 7469 was also observed with Chandra\nby Jiang et al. (2006) who find a purely Galactic absorption\nof NH = 4.9 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 . After correcting for the different\nCosmology we use as well as for a slightly different redshift,\nthe luminosity they estimate, translates to L2\u221210kev = 1.46 \u00d7 1043\nerg s\u22121 . This is in good agreement with the result of Zhou &\nWang. Scott et al. (2005) observed this object simultaneously\nin the X-rays and UV domains with Chandra, FUSE and STIS.\nThey do not state a 2-10 keV flux in their paper. However,\nusing the power law model shown in their figure 1, we derive\nF2\u221210keV = 2.46 \u00d7 10\u221211 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 . This, in turn, yields\nL2\u221210keV = 1.45 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121 . As these three observations agree\nvery well with each other, we will use the mean luminosity and\nset the uncertainty to 0.2 dex.\nNGC 7674: This object appears to be Compton-thick.\nMalaguti et al. (1998) suggest an intrinsic luminosity of\nL2\u221210keV \u2248 1045 erg s\u22121 . For their estimate they assume the\nelectron scattering material to have the same geometry as in\nthe prototypical Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068. Correcting for\nthe different Cosmology they use, decreases this number to\n\u223c 4.4 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 . Another way to estimate the intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity is via the correlation between the [O\nIII]\u03bb5007 and 2-10 keV fluxes that was found by Panessa et al.\n(2006): log F2\u221210keV \u2212 log F[OIII] \u2248 1.74. Dahari & De Robertis\n(1988) measured a flux of F[OIII] = 4.3 \u00d7 10\u221213 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 .\nBassani et al. (1999) corrected this result for intrinsic absorpint\ntion and obtained F[OIII]\n= (1.85 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 10\u221212 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122\nwith which, in turn, we obtain L2\u221210keV = 1.8 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 .\nThis result is in good agreement with the estimate by Malaguti\net al., especially regarding the somewhat speculative nature of\nboth methods. However, Bassani et al.'s absorption correction of\nthe [O III]\u03bb5007 flux may suffer from the large slit (2.7\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 4.0\u2032\u2032 )\nDahari & De Robertis (1988) used. If the Balmer decrement was\naffected by off-nuclear emission, the reddening could easily be\nunderestimated. In a private communication to Malaguti et al.\n44\n(1998), R. Maiolino reports Lint\nerg s\u22121 . In the\n[OIII] \u2248 6 \u00d7 10\ncosmology used by Malaguti et al., this corresponds to a [O\nIII]\u03bb5007 line flux of 1.5 \u00d710\u221210 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 . This, in turn, yields\nL2\u221210keV \u2248 1.5 \u00d7 1046 erg s\u22121 , i.e. a source that is two orders\nof magnitude brighter than estimated by Malaguti et al. For our\nanalysis we will use the more conservative luminosity estimate\nof Malaguti et al. and Bassani et al. by using the average of their\nestimates and allowing for an uncertainty of 1 order of mag-\n\n\fH.

An even higher luminosity, however, can clearly not be\nruled out.\nNGC 7679: The only available recent hard X-ray data of this\nobject seem to be the ones from Della Ceca et al. (2001) who use\nASCA and BeppoSAX data. Their analysis yields NH = 2.2+1.8\n\u22121.4 \u00d7\n1020 cm\u22122 and F2\u221210keV = 5.6 \u00d7 10\u221212 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 , the latter\ncorresponding to L2\u221210kev = 3.3 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121 .\n\nList of Objects\n'Fairall 9' on page 2\n'NGC 526a' on page 2\n'NGC 3783' on page 2\n'NGC 4579' on page 2\n'NGC 4593' on page 2\n'PKS 2048-57' on page 2\n'PG 2130+099' on page 2\n'NGC 7314' on page 2\n'NGC 526a' on page 2\n'NGC 7314' on page 2\n'MCG-01-01-043' on page 2\n'Mrk 590' on page 2\n'NGC 1097' on page 2\n'NGC 4303' on page 2\n'NGC 4472' on page 2\n'NGC 4507' on page 2\n'NGC 4698' on page 2\n'NGC 4941' on page 2\n'IRAS 13197-1627' on page 2\n'Cen A' on page 2\n'NGC 5135' on page 2\n'MCG-06-30-15' on page 2\n'NGC 5995' on page 2\n'ESO 141-G55' on page 2\n'Mrk 509' on page 2\n'NGC 7172' on page 2\n'NGC 7213' on page 2\n'3C 445' on page 2\n'NGC 7469' on page 2\n'NGC 7674' on page 2\n'NGC 7679' on page 2\n'NGC 4303' on page 2\n'Cen A' on page 2\n'NGC 4303' on page 2\n'NGC 4472' on page 2\n'Cen A' on page 2\n'3C 445' on page 3\n'NGC 7674' on page 3\n'NGC 7679' on page 3\n'NGC 1097' on page 3\n'NGC 5135' on page 3\n'NGC 7469' on page 3\n'NGC 526a' on page 3\n'NGC 7314' on page 3\n'MCG-01-01-043' on page 4\n'Mrk 590' on page 4\n'Mrk 590' on page 4\n'Mrk 590' on page 4\n'NGC 1097' on page 4\n'NGC 4303' on page 4\n'NGC 4472' on page 4\n'NGC 4507' on page 4\n'NGC 4507' on page 4\n\n'NGC 4507' on page 4\n'NGC 4698' on page 4\n'NGC 4941' on page 4\n'IRAS 13197-1627' on page 4\n'IRAS 13197-1627' on page 4\n'IRAS 13197-1627' on page 4\n'Cen A' on page 4\n'Cen A' on page 4\n'Cen A' on page 4\n'NGC 5135' on page 4\n'MCG-06-30-15' on page 4\n'MCG-06-30-15' on page 4\n'MCG-06-30-15' on page 4\n'NGC 5995' on page 4\n'NGC 5995' on page 4\n'NGC 5995' on page 4\n'ESO 141-G55' on page 4\n'ESO 141-G55' on page 4\n'ESO 141-G55' on page 4\n'Mrk 509' on page 4\n'Mrk 509' on page 4\n'Mrk 509' on page 4\n'PKS 2048-57' on page 4\n'PKS 2048-57' on page 4\n'PKS 2048-57' on page 4\n'NGC 7172' on page 4\n'NGC 7213' on page 4\n'NGC 7213' on page 4\n'NGC 7213' on page 4\n'3C 445' on page 4\n'3C 445' on page 4\n'3C 445' on page 4\n'NGC 7469' on page 4\n'NGC 7469' on page 4\n'NGC 7469' on page 4\n'NGC 7674' on page 4\n'NGC 7679' on page 4\n'NGC 7679' on page 4\n'NGC 7679' on page 4\n'NGC 4303' on page 4\n'NGC 4698' on page 4\n'PKS 2048-57' on page 4\n'NGC 4472' on page 5\n'NGC 4579' on page 5\n'NGC 1097' on page 5\n'Cen A' on page 5\n'NGC 4579' on page 6\n'NGC 5135' on page 6\n'NGC 7674' on page 6\n'NGC 5135' on page 6\n'NGC 7469' on page 6\n'Fairall 9' on page 8\n'NGC 526A' on page 8\n'NGC 3783' on page 8\n'NGC 4579' on page 8\n'NGC 4593' on page 8\n'PKS 2048-57' on page 8\n'PG 2130+099' on page 9\n'NGC 7314' on page 9\n'MCG-01-01-43' on page 9\n'Mrk 590' on page 9\n'NGC 1097' on page 9\n'NGC 4303' on page 9\n'NGC 4472' on page 9\n\n11\n\n\f12\n\nH.
