Double Liouville potential\nand general dilaton coupling is considered to obtain more general solutions with extra parameters and diagonal metric in the theory. From the outset we remind that, depending on\nthe relative parameters, the double Liouville potential has the advantage of admitting local\nextrema and critical points. The Higgs potential also shares such features, whereas single\nLiouville potential lacks these properties. Double Liouville-type potentials arise also when\nhigher-dimensional theories are compactified to 4\u2212dimensional spacetimes and expectedly\nbring in further richness. All known solutions to date can be obtained [1\u20133] as particular\nlimits of our general solution, and it contains new solutions as well. In the most general form\nour solution covers Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) type black holes and Bertotti-Robinson (BR)\nspacetimes interpolated within the same metric. Interpolation of two different solutions in\ngeneral relativity is not a new idea [4]. Particular limits of the dilatonic parameter yield\nthe RN and BR spacetimes. In between the two, the linear dilaton black hole (LDBH) lies\nfor the specific choice of the parameters. It is well-known that the near horizon geometry\nof the extremal RN black hole yields the BR electromagnetic universe. The latter [5] is\nimportant for various reasons: It is a singularity free non-black hole solution which admits\nmaximal symmetry and finds application in conformal field theory correspondence (i.e. AdS/\nCFT). Particles in the BR universe move with uniform acceleration in a conformally flat\nbackground. These features are mostly valid not only in N = 4 but in higher dimensions\n(N > 4) as well. The topological structure of the BR spacetime is still AdS2 \u00d7 S N \u22122 in\n\nN\u2212dimensions with the radius of S N \u22122 depending on the dimension of the space. Recently\n\nwe have extended the Maxwell part of the BR spacetime to cover the Yang-Mills (YM) field\nand obtained common features that share with the Maxwell field [6]. The dilatonic black\nhole solution involved in the general solution obtained in this paper is non-asymptotically\nflat, therefore we expressed it in terms of the quasi local mass (MQL ) [7]. The metric is regular at horizons with only available singularity at r = 0. Another feature is the asymptotic\n(r \u2192 \u221e) absence of (anti) de-Sitter property which was discovered also within the context\nof different models [3]. Our general solution has been tested for stability against the radial,\nlinear perturbations. We found that presence of dilaton can trigger instability in the RN\n2\n\n\fblack hole which is stable otherwise. Our analysis proves that the BR sector remains manifestly stable against such perturbations. Thermodynamic stability has also been discussed\nbriefly by considering the specific heat of the metric. Divergence in the specific heat for\nspecific values of the parameters signals phase transition in our thermodynamic system, i.e.,\ntopology change in the spacetime.\nNext, we concentrate ourselves on the LDBH case and analyze the Hawking temperature\nboth from semi-classical and standard surface gravity methods [8, 9]. We point out the\ncontrasts between the two methods when there are single and double horizons. The high\nfrequency limit of the semi-classical radiation spectrum method (SCRSM ) does not agree\nwith the Hawking's result. It is observed, as an interesting contribution in this work that\nthe coupling between scalar field charge and the magnetic charge of the spacetime gives rise\nto spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics which plays a dominant role in the difference. In the\nabsence of such coupling, when the scalar field is assumed chargeless for instance, similar\nanalysis was carried out previously and we had recovered the same results easily. It turns\nout that the very existence of a spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics in the theory transforms\na divergent temperature spacetime to a finite one. We argue that such a behavior may play\na leading role in the detection of such LDBHs.\nIn the final section of the paper we appeal once more to the test scalar field equation, but\nthis time with the purpose to investigate the quantum nature of the naked singularities. We\nidentify first the particular solution that yields horizonless naked singularity at r = 0. By\ninvoking the Horowitz-Marolf [10] criterion on quantum nature of classical singularities we\nexplore under which set of parameters classically singular but quantum mechanically regular\nmetrics can occur in our general solution.\nThe organization of our paper is as follows. In Sec. II we introduce our action, field\nequations and obtain the general solution. Sec. III singles out the linear dilaton case\nand investigates the stability of our general solution. Application of the SCRSM and its\nconnection with the Hawking temperature is employed in Sec. IV. Sec. V discusses the\nstatus of naked singularities from quantum picture. We summarize our results in conclusion\nwhich appears in Sec. VI.\n\n3\n\n\fII.\n\nFIELD EQUATIONS AND THE METRIC ANSATZ FOR EMD GRAVITY\n\nThe 4\u2212dimensional action in the EMD theory is given by (8\u03c0G = 1)\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n1\n1\n1\n4 \u221a\n\u03bc\n\u03bb\u03c3\nS = d x \u2212g\nR \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202 \u03c6 \u2212 V (\u03c6) \u2212 W (\u03c6) (F\u03bb\u03c3 F ) ,\n2\n2\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nV (\u03c6) = V1 e\u03b21 \u03c6 + V2 e\u03b22 \u03c6 ,\n\nW (\u03c6) = \u03bb1 e\u22122\u03b31 \u03c6 + \u03bb2 e\u22122\u03b32 \u03c6 .\n\n(2)\n\n\u03c6 refers to the dilaton scalar potential and \u03b3i denotes the dilaton parameter, \u03bbi is a constant\nand V (\u03c6) is a double Liouville-type potential. We note that we exclude the simultaneous\nvalues \u03b21 = \u03b22 and \u03b31 = \u03b32 in general, since these particular values lead to the already\nknown cases.\nLet us remark that although double Liouville potential in V (\u03c6) , which renders local\nminima, necessary for construction of vacuum states possible, the similar choice for W (\u03c6)\nseems less appealing. It will be justified from the exact solutions below, however, that there\nare asymptotics which remains inaccessible by the choice of a single Liouville term in W (\u03c6) .\nStated otherwise, at both asymptotes of r = 0 and r = \u221e (or r\u0303 = 0 and r\u0303 = \u221e for LDBH)\ndilatonic coupling to the magnetic field becomes much stronger. Choosing a single Liouville\npotential simply looses the strength at one end of the range. Besides, it is all a matter of\nchoice to set \u03bb1 (\u03bb2 ) = 0, which makes the dilatonic coupling asymptotically free. In the\nLDBH case as it will be proved, if we set \u03bb1 = 0, we shall remove the possibility of an inner\n(Cauchy) horizon which justifies the advantages and motivation for choosing the double\nLiouville-type potential in W (\u03c6) .

Here also we have a 4\u2212dimensional\naction in the EM theory with cosmological constant but the metric function represents a\nBR space time.\nBy looking at the asymptotic behaviors of the general solution one finds that 0 \u2264 \u03b12 < 1\n\nand 1 < \u03b12 correspond to the cases of RN and BR solutions, respectively. Here \u03b12 = 1 acts\n7\n\n\fmuch like a phase transition which changes the structure of space time from RN into BR.\nThe thermodynamic instability from the expression of specific heat capacity CQ , (Eq. (58)\ngiven below) justifies this fact. It is quite interesting to see what will be the answer if one\nchooses \u03b12 = 1. In the next section we concentrate on this critical value for \u03b12 .\n\nIII.\n\nTHE LINEAR DILATON\n\nFrom the asymptotic behavior of the metric function one may see that \u03b12 = 1 is a critical\nvalue and the behavior of spacetime changes. In this chapter we only concentrate on this\nspecific value for \u03b12 , and will be referred to as linear dilaton. The general solution after this\nsetting reads\n1\n\u2212\u03b31 = \u03b32 = \u221a ,\n2\n\u221a\n\u03b21 = \u03b22 = 2,\n\n(27)\n\n\u221a\n1\n\u03c6 (r) = \u2212 \u221a ln r, R (r) = A r,\n2\n\u03bb1\n\u1e7c\n+ \u03bb2 r,\nV = , W =\nr\nr\nA2 = 2\u03bb2 Q2 ,\n\u0014\n\n\u03bb1\nf (r) =\n+\n\u03bb2 A2 r\n\n\u0012\n\n(\u03bb2 > 0)\n\n1\n\u2212 2\u1e7c\nA2\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0015\n\nr \u2212 M\u0303 ,\n\n(28)\n\nwhere \u1e7c = V1 + V2 .\nIn order to explore the physical properties of the linear dilaton case we perform the\n\u221a\ntransformation R (r) = A r \u2192 re. This transforms the metric into,\nds2 = \u2212f (e\nr )dt2 +\n\nin which\n1\nf (e\nr) = 2\nre\n\n\u0012\u0012\n\n4e\nr2\nde\nr 2 + re2 d\u03a92 ,\nA4 f (e\nr)\n\n1\n\u2212 2\u1e7c\nA2\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03bb1\nre4\n2\n\u2212\nM\nr\ne\n+\nQL\nA2\n\u03bb2\n\n(29)\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(30)\n\nwhere the mass MQL denotes the quasilocal mass whose general definition is given below in\nEq.

The solution is\n\nwhere\n\n1\nreh = \u221a\n2a\na=\n\n\u0012\n\nr\n\nMQL \u00b1\n\nq\n2\nMQL\n\u2212 4ac,\n\n(32)\n\n\u0013\n\nc=\n\n\u03bb1\n.\n\u03bb2\n\n(33)\n\n1\n\u2212 2\u1e7c\nA2\n\n1\n,\nA2\n\nThe linear dilaton solution admits single or double-horizons if the parameters are chosen\n2\nappropriately. Another possible case is the extremal limit that occurs if MQL\n= 4ac. The\nq\nMQL\nhorizon in this particular case is given by reh =\n. The double horizon case occurs if the\n2a\nq\n2\n2\n\u2212 4ac and MQL\n> 4ac. This choice leads\nparameters simultaneously satisfy MQL > MQL\n\nto the horizons\n\nre+ =\nre\u2212 =\n\nv\nq\nu\nu M + M 2 \u2212 4ac\nt QL\nQL\n\n2a\nv\nq\nu\nu M \u2212 M 2 \u2212 4ac\nt QL\nQL\n2a\n\n,\n\n(34)\n\n.\n\nThe relations between the parameters and double-Liouville-type potentials in the formation of black holes becomes evident if one looks for the critical case. This is the case when\nq\n2\n\u2212 4ac, which follows that 2\u1e7c = A12 . Hence if 2\u1e7c < A12 , no horizon forms\nMQL = MQL\n\nand the central singularity re = 0 becomes a naked singularity. It can easily be seen that for\n\n\u03bb1 = 0, or for the single Liouville-type potential in W (\u03c6) , we have automatically single,\n\nouter event horizon alone. Another interesting property is in the behavior of the curvature\nscalar R. The curvature scalar for the metric function (29) is,\n\nR=\u2212\n\n4e\nr 4 (aA4 \u2212 1) \u2212 A4 (ae\nr 4 \u2212 MQL re2 + c)\n.\n2e\nr6\n9\n\n(35)\n\n\fNote that the curvature scalar is finite at the location of horizons. Furthermore, when\nre \u2192 \u221e , the Kretschmann and curvature scalars, the Liouville-type potentials and the\n\ncoupling term of dilaton with Maxwell field all vanish. The mass and charge are finite and\nthe dominant field is gravity with finite curvature. Consequently, the solution given in Eq.\n(29) is well-behaved. However, the Q = 0 limit does not exist.\n\nA.\n\nLinear stability analysis of the general solution\n\nBy employing a similar method used by Yazadjiev [11] we investigate the stability of the\npossible EMD solution, in terms of a linear, radial perturbation. To do so we assume that\nour dilatonic scalar field \u03c6 (r) changes into \u03c6\u25e6 (r) + \u03c8 (t, r) , in which \u03c8 (t, r) is very weak\ncompared to the original dilaton field \u03c6\u25e6 (r) and we call it the perturbed term. As a result\nwe choose our perturbed metric as\nds2 = \u2212f (r) e\u0393(t,r) dt2 + e\u03c7(t,r)\n\ndr 2\n+ R (r)2 d\u03a922 .\nf (r)\n\n(36)\n\nOne should notice that, since our gauge potentials are magnetic, the Maxwell equations\n(Eq.(8)) are satisfied. The linearized version of the field equations (11-14) plus one extra\nterm for Rtr are given by\n\u03c7t (t, r) R\u2032 (r)\nRtr :\n= \u2202r \u03c6\u25e6 (r) \u2202t \u03c8 (t, r)\nR (r)\nQ2 2\n1\n\u2202\u03c6 W (\u03c6\u25e6 ) \u03c8\n\u22072\u25e6 \u03c8 \u2212 \u03c7\u22072\u25e6 \u03c6\u25e6 + (\u0393 \u2212 \u03c7)r \u03c6\u2032\u25e6 f \u2212 \u2202\u03c62\u25e6 V (\u03c6\u25e6 ) \u03c8 =\n2\nR (r)4 \u25e6\n\u0013\n\u0012\nQ2\n1\n\u2032\n2\nR\u03b8\u03b8 : (1 \u2212 R\u25e6\u03b8\u03b8 ) \u03c7 \u2212 RR f (\u0393 \u2212 \u03c7)r = R \u2202\u03c6\u25e6 V (\u03c6\u25e6 ) + 2 \u2202\u03c6\u25e6 W (\u03c6\u25e6 ) \u03c8\n2\nR\nin which a lower index\n\n\u25e6\n\n(37)\n(38)\n(39)\n\nrepresents the quantity in the unperturbed metric.

Again by imposing\nthe same constraint , one can show that U (r) is positive. It is not difficult to apply the\nseparation method on (41) to get\n\u00b1\u01ebt\n\n\u03c8 (t, r) = e\n\n\u03b6 (r) ,\n\n\u22072\u25e6 \u03b6\n\n(r) \u2212 Uef f (r) \u03b6 (r) = 0,\n\nUef f (r) =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\u01eb2\n+ U (r) ,\nf\n\n(43)\n\nwhere \u01eb is a constant. If one shows that the effective potential Uef f (r) is positive for any\nreal value for \u01eb it means that there exists a solution for \u03b6 (r) which is not bounded. In other\nwords by the linear perturbation our black hole solution is stable for any value of \u01eb.\nBut in our case one must be careful. For instance let's go back to the general solution\n(19) and set V1 = 0,\n(1 + \u03b12 )\n\n\u001a\u0012\n\nQ2 \u03bb2\n\u2212 V2\nA4\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0001\nr2\nQ2 \u03bb1\n2\n\u2212M 1+\u03b1 r+\n\u03b12\nA4\n\n\u001b\n\n,\n(44)\n2\nr 1+\u03b12\nthis solution may have double horizons, single horizon (extremal) or no horizon. These\nf (r) =\n\ndepend on the values of the parameters. One may notice that this solution is a nonasymptotically flat metric and therefore the ADM mass is not defined in general. Following\nthe quasilocal mass formalism introduced by Brown and York [7] it is known that, a spherically symmetric N\u2212dimensional metric solution as\nds2 = \u2212F (R)2 dt2 +\n\ndR2\n+ R2 d\u03a92N \u22122 ,\nG (R)2\n\n(45)\n\nadmits a quasilocal mass MQL defined by [6, 7]\nMQL =\n\nN \u2212 2 N \u22123\nRB F (RB ) (Gref (RB ) \u2212 G (RB )) .\n2\n\n(46)\n\nHere Gref (R) is an arbitrary non-negative reference function, which yields the zero of the\nenergy for the background spacetime, and RB is the radius of the spacelike hypersurface\nboundary. Applying this formalism to the solution (44), one obtains the horizon M in terms\nof MQL as\n2\nMQL ,\n(47)\n(1 + \u03b12 ) A2\nafter which the metric function becomes\n\u001a\u0012 2\n\u0013 2\n\u001b\n(1 + \u03b12 )\nQ \u03bb2\nr\n2MQL\nQ2 \u03bb1\nf (r) =\n\u2212 V2\n\u2212\nr+\n.\n(48)\n2\nA4\n\u03b12\nA2\nA4\nr 1+\u03b12\nIndeed, since we wish to cover all known solutions in the literature of this kind, we consider\nM=\n\n\u03bbi , MQL \u2265 0, and\n\n\u0012\n\nQ2 \u03bb2\n\u2212 V2\nA4\n11\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2265 0.\n\n(49)\n\n\fThis condition together with Eq.

In other words,\nafter simplification, one can rewrite U (r) as\n\u001a\u0012 2\n\u0013 \u0012 2\n\u0013 \u001b\n2\nQ \u03bb2\nQ \u03bb2\n1\nU (r) =\n,\n\u2212 V2 +\n+ V2\n2\n4\n4\nA\nA\n\u03b12\nr 1+\u03b12\n2\n\nwhich reveals for \u2212 QA\u03bb4 2 \u2264 V2 \u2264\n\nQ2 \u03bb2\n,\nA4\n\n(50)\n\nU (r) and then Uef f (r) are positive, which means\n2\n\n2\nwhere\nthat the corresponding metric is stable.

(28), by using a method of semi-classical\nradiation spectrum, which has been recently designated as SCRSM [9]. The main difference\nbetween our present work with others [8, 9] (and references therein) is that the considered\nnon-extreme LDBHs possess two horizons, due to having magnetic charge, instead of one.\n13\n\n\fHere, we first consider a massless scalar field \u03a8 with charge q obeying the covariant\nKlein-Gordon equation in the LDBH geometry. Namely, we look for the exact solution of\nthe following equation,\n\u0003\u03a8 = 0,\n\n(60)\n\nwhere the d' Alembertian operator \u0003 is given by\n\u221a\n1\n\u0003 = \u221a D\u03bc ( \u2212gg \u03bc\u03bd D\u03bd ),\n\u2212g\n\n(61)\n\nD\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u2212 iqA\u03bc .\n\n(62)\n\nin which D\u03bc symbolizes the covariant gauge differential operator as being\n\nThe scalar wave function \u03a8 of Eq. (60) can be separated to the angular and radial equations\nby letting\n\u03a8 = Z(r)\u00a3(\u03b8)ei(m\u03c6\u2212\u03c9t) ,\n\n(63)\n\nthe separated angular equation can be found as\n#\n(m + p cos \u03b8)2\n\u00a3 = 0,\n\u00a3 + cot \u03b8\u00a3 + \u03bb \u2212\nsin2 \u03b8\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\"\n\n(64)\n\nwhere p = qQ and \u03bb is a separation constant. (From now on, a prime denotes the derivative\nwith respect to its argument.) After setting the eigenvalue \u03bb = l(l + 1) \u2212 p2 in Eq. (64),\n\none can see that solutions to the angular part, \u00a3(\u03b8)eim\u03c6 , are the spin-weighted spheroidal\nharmonics p Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6) with spin-weight p [13].\n\nOn the other hand, before proceeding to the radial equation, one may rewrite the metric\nfunction f (r) in Eq. (28) as\nb\nf (r) = (r \u2212 r2 )(r \u2212 r1 ),\nr\n\n(65)\n\nwhere r2 and r1 denote the outer and inner horizons of the LDBHs, respectively. In the new\nform of the metric function Eq.

One can\nimmediately observe that Eq.

In order to find\nthe vacuum 'in' and 'out' states for the scalar field we have to choose the metric such that\nthe surface gravity and mass of the black hole both vanish. This can be done from (66), by\nchoosing c2 = 4ab first, to make an extremal LDBH (with zero temperature), and next, to\nlet c \u2192 0 to make the mass also zero. These conditions cast our LDBH metric into\ndr 2\nds = \u2212brdt +\n+ A2 rd\u03a92 .\nbr\n2\n\n2\n\n(88)\n\nBy simple arrangement this vacuum metric transforms into\nds2 = \u03c12 \u2212d\u03c4 2 + dx2 + d\u03a92\nwhere\n\n\u0001\n\n\u221a\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\u03c4, \u03c1 = Ae 2 x , \u03b2 = A b.\nb\nThe massless Klein-Gordon equation \u22072 \u03a6 = 0, with \u03a6 = \u03c11 \u03a8 takes the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u03b22\n\u2202\u03c4 \u03c4 \u2212 \u2202xx +\n+ l (l + 1) \u03a8 = 0.\n\u03c13\n4\nr = e\u03b2x ,\n\n(89)\n\nt=\n\n(90)\n\nThe vacuum 'in' and 'out' solutions for the scalar field are\n1\n\u03a6in \u223c \u221a e\u2212i(\u03b2\u03c3x+\u03c9t)\nr\n1 i(\u03b2\u03c3x\u2212\u03c9t)\n\u03a6out \u223c \u221a e\nr\n18\n\n(91)\n\n\fwhere \u03c3 has the meaning from (71). Once these states propagate from vacuum they turn\ninto thermal states as described above.\nSo the question arises here as in which case does the temperature Eq. (82) matches\nwith the value of TH in Eq. (84)? The answer is absolutely related with the value of\nphysical parameter, \u03c3.

(71) in order to see that the\n\npredomination of \u03c3 strictly depends on negative values of \u03bb. However, this is possible only\nwith the case of p2 = q 2 Q2 > l(l + 1). Hence, a significant remark is revealed that obtaining\nTH of the non-extreme LDBHs from the SCRSM, the only possibility is to consider charged\nscalar waves instead of chargeless ones.\nFurthermore, we want to serve most intriguing figures about the spectrum temperature\nEq. (82). To this end, first we plot T versus frequency \u03c9 of non-extreme LDBHs with\nr1 , r2 6= 0 for low and high |p|-values, and display all graphs in Fig. 1. As it can be seen\nfrom Fig. 1 in the high frequencies the thermal behaviors of the LDBHs with different |p|values exhibits similar behaviors in which their temperatures approach to Thigh while \u03c9 \u2192 \u221e.\nThe plot with low |p|-value in Fig. 1 does not behave like the Hawking temperature. On\nthe other hand, the other plot in Fig. 1, which has high |p|-value represents the Hawking\ntemperature TH in the low frequencies (\u03c9 > 0). Beside this, once the parameter \u03c3 is lost its\npredomination against\n\n\u03c9 r2 +r1\n(\n),\nb r2 \u2212r1\n\nthe latter plot increases to reach the Thigh with increasing\n\nfrequency as well. In the case of the non-extreme LDBHs with r1 = 0, there is no difference\nbetween Thigh and TH because of Eq. (84), and at the low |p|-values the temperature T\nexhibits similar behavior as in the case r1 , r2 6= 0, which is the well-known thermal character\nin the EMD theory [8]. By the way, one should exclude \u03c9 = 0 during the plotting of the\n19\n\n\ftemperature. Because it causes uncertainty for the temperature Eq. (82) and physically this\ncase is not acceptable since we consider the propagation of scalar waves. Fig. 2 is about the\ngraph of T versus frequency \u03c9 of non-extreme LDBHs with r1 = 0 in a high |p|-value. In\nthis figure, it is illustrated that by increasing the frequency from 0+ , the temperature first\n\nstarts from a constant value, which is TH and then makes a peak (not much higher than\nTH ), and then decreases back to TH while \u03c9 \u2192 \u221e. Rousingly, one can observe that the\nbehavior of the graph in Fig. 2 is very similar to the graph obtained from the well-known\nPlanck radiation formula, see for instance [16]. Besides, both Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 show us\nthat whenever high |p|-values are present, the frequency of the scalar wave needed to detect\nthe temperature of the LDBHs as to be the Hawking temperature TH can either be very\nhigh (only for r1 = 0 case, which is already known before [8]) or low. The latter information\nabout the relationship between TH and low frequencies is completely new for us, and may\nplay crucial role for the thermal detection of the LDBHs in the future.\n\nV.\n\nSINGULARITY ANALYSIS\n\nIn section II, we present a solution in 4\u2212dimensional static spherically symmetric EMD\ntheory that incorporates two Liouville-type potential terms coupled with gravity together\nwith magnetically charged dilatonic parameters. We have clarified that the solution possess\na central singularity which is a characteristic feature for spherically symmetric systems. In\nthe solutions that admit black holes this singularity is clothed by horizons. However, there\nare cases that this singularity is not hidden behind a horizons. In such cases the singularity\nis called a naked singularity.\nIn classical general relativity, singularities are described as incomplete geodesics. This\nsimply means that the evolution of timelike or null geodesics is not defined after a finite\nproper time. There is a general consensus that a removal of classical singularities is not\nimportant only for quantum gravity but also for other fundamental theories. In view of\nthis consensus, we are aiming to analyze whether these classical naked singularities that\noccur in the general solution described in Eqs. (16)-(19) and in its linear dilaton limit\ngiven in Eqs. (27) and (28), turn out to be \"strong\" or \"smoothed out\" when probed with\nquantum test particles. Our analysis will be based on the pioneering work of Wald [12]\nwhich was developed by Horowitz and Marolf (HM)[10]. HM, have proposed a criterion\n20\n\n\fto test the classical singularities with quantum test particles that obey the Klein-Gordon\nequation for static spacetimes having timelike singularities. The criterion of HM has been\napplied successfully for several spacetimes [17\u201319] within the context of quantum mechanical\nconcepts. Among the others, HM have already analyzed the quantum singularity for the\nextreme case of the charged dilatonic black hole in the absence of Liouville-type potentials.\nThey confirmed that for a specific interval of dilaton parameter, the singularity is quantum\nmechanically regular. The brief review of the criterion is as follows.\nA scalar quantum particle with mass m is described by the Klein-Gordon equation\n(\u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bc \u2212 m2 ) \u03c8 = 0. This equation can be written by splitting the temporal and spatial por\u0001\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2\ntion as \u2202\u2202t\u03c82 = \u2212A\u03c8, such that the spatial operator A is defined by A = \u2212 f D i f Di +\nf m2 , where f = \u2212\u03be \u03bc \u03be\u03bc with \u03be \u03bc the timelike Killing field, while Di is the spatial covariant\n\nderivative defined on the static slice \u03a3. Then, the Klein-Gordon equation for a free rela\u221a\n\u221a \u0001\n=\nA\nAE \u03c8 (0) . If the\ntivistic particle satisfies i \u2202\u03c8\n\u03c8,\nwith\nthe\nsolution\n\u03c8\n(t)\n=\nexp\nit\nE\n\u2202t\nextension of the operator A is not essentially self-adjoint, the future time evolution of the\n\nwave function is ambiguous. Then, HM criterion defines the spacetime quantum mechanically singular. However, if there is only one self-adjoint extension, the operator A is said\nto be essentially self-adjoint and the quantum evolution \u03c8 (t) is uniquely determined by the\ninitial condition. According to the HM criterion, this spacetime is said to be quantum mechanically regular. Consequently, a sufficient condition for the operator A to be essentially\nself-adjoint is to investigate the solutions satisfying the following equation ( see Ref. [20] for\na detailed mathematical background),\nA\u03c8 \u00b1 i\u03c8 = 0.\n\n(93)\n\nThis equation admits separable solution and hence the radial part becomes,\n\u22022\u03c6\n1 \u2202 (f R2 ) \u2202\u03c6 l (l + 1)\nm2\n\u03c6\n+\n\u2212\n\u03c6\n\u2212\n\u03c6\n\u00b1\ni\n= 0,\n2\n\u2202r 2\nfR\n\u2202r \u2202r\nf r2\nf\nf2\n\n(94)\n\nin which l (l + 1) \u2265 0 is the eigenvalue of the Laplacian on the 2\u2212sphere. The necessary\ncondition for the operator A to be essentially self adjoint is that at least one of the solutions\nto this equation fails to be of finite norm when r \u2192 0. In summery, the self adjointness of the\noperator A, implies the well-posedness of the initial value problem. Therefore, the suitable\nnorm k\u03c6k for this case is the Sobolev norm which is used first time within this context by\nIshibashi and Hosoya [20] defined by,\n21\n\n\fq2\nk\u03c6k =\n2\n2\n\nZ\n\n2 \u22121\n\nRf\n\n1\n|\u03c6| d\u03bcdr +\n2\n2\n\nZ\n\nR2 f |\n\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202r\n\n2\n\nd\u03bcdr,\n\n(95)\n\nwhere q 2 is a positive constant and d\u03bc is the volume element on the unit 2\u2212sphere. The\nregularity of the central singularity at r = 0 in quantum mechanical sense requires that the\nsquared norm of the solutions of the Eq. (94) should be divergent for each l (l + 1) and each\nsign of imaginary term. The norm k\u03c6k is divergent for l (l + 1) > 0 if it is for l = 0, so\nessential self-adjointness will be examined for l = 0 (S \u2212 wave) case. This implies essential\nself adjointness for the operator A. Furthermore, we assume, a massless case (i.e. m = 0),\n\nand ignoring the term \u00b1i f\u03c62 ( since it is negligible near the origin).\nA.\n\nA more general case:\n\nThe general solution for any value of \u03b12 which is related to the dilaton parameters \u03b31\nand \u03b32 is given in the Eq. (18). Since this solution is complicated enough for integrability,\nwe consider the specific values of \u03b12 = 3 and V1 = 0. Hence, the general solution becomes;\n16a2\nf (r) = \u221a (r \u2212 r2 ) (r \u2212 r1 ) ,\nr\n\n(96)\n\nwhere\n\nr\u03031,2 =\na1 =\n\nM\u00b1\n\n\u221a\n\nM 2 \u2212 4a1 a2\n,\n2a2\n\nQ2 \u03bb1\n,\n4A4\n\na2 =\n\n(97)\n1\n12\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nQ2 \u03bb2\n\u2212 V2 .\nA4\n\nThe extreme case occurs when M 2 = 4a1 a2 . In this case there is one horizon only and it\n\u221a\nM\nis given by rh = 2a\n. If M > M 2 \u2212 4a1 a2 and M 2 > 4a1 a2 , this particular case admits\n2\n\ntwo horizons given by r\u03031,2 . However, if M 2 \u2212 4a1 a2 < 0, no black hole forms and hence, the\nsingularity at r = 0 becomes naked.\nAs a requirement of the HM criterion, the singularity at r = 0 must have a timelike\nR\ncharacter. This can be checked if one introduces tortoise coordinate defined by r\u2217 = dr\nf\n\nand take its limit as r \u2192 0. We found that the limit is finite. Therefore, the singularity is\ntimelike. The solution for Eq. (94) is\n\n22\n\n\f\u03c6(r) =\n\nr \u2212 r\u03032\nA\u22122\n.\nln\n16a2 (r\u03032 \u2212 r\u03031 )\nr \u2212 r\u03031\n\n(98)\n\nThe first and the second terms of the squared norm (95) is finite, when r \u2192 0.\nConsequently, the operator A is not essentially self-adjoint and therefore, the central\nsingularity r = 0, remain quantum mechanically singular.\n\nB.\n\nThe linear dilaton case:\n\nThe metric function for the linear dilaton case can be written as, (from Eq. (65))\n\nf (r) =\n\nb\n(r \u2212 r2 ) (r \u2212 r1 ) ,\nr\n\nwhere\np\nM\u0303 2 \u2212 4ab\n,\nr1,2 =\n2b\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u03bb1\nb=\n\u2212 2\u1e7c .\na= 2 ,\nA \u03bb2\nA2\nM\u0303 \u00b1\n\nThe naked singularity occurs when M\u0303 2 \u2212 4ab < 0. The tortoise coordinate r\u2217 =\n\nR\n\ndr\nf\n\nis finite\n\nand indicating a timelike character at r = 0. The Penrose diagram of this particular case\nis shown in Fig. 3-a. The radial part of the separable Eq. (94) has solution for the linear\ndilaton case as,\n\n\u03c6(r) =\n\nbA2\n\n1\nr \u2212 r2\nln\n.\n(r2 \u2212 r1 )\nr \u2212 r1\n\n(99)\n\nThe first and the second term of the squared norm defined in Eq. (95) is finite. Therefore\nthe spacetime is quantum mechanically singular. For the double-horizon case, M\u0303 2 \u22124ab > 0,\nwhich implies r1 6= r2 6= 0 6= r1 , the timelike singularity at r = 0 is not naked, and its Penrose\ndiagram is depicted in Fig. 3-b. However, for a special case \u03bb1 = 0, the solution to Eq. (94)\nis\n\u03c6(r) =\nin which rh =\n\nM\u0303\n.\nb\n\nr \u2212 rh\nA2\nln\n,\nr\nbM\u0303\n\n(100)\n\nThe first term of the squared norm (95) is finite, whereas the second term\n\nbehaves as,\n23\n\n\f\u223c (ln |r|)|r=0 \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(101)\n\nHence, under the condition \u03bb1 = 0, the central classical singularity becomes quantum mechanically non-singular. When we have a single-horizon, with the choice \u03bb1 = 0, for example,\nthe singularity r = 0, is shown in the Penrose diagram (Fig. 3-c).\n\nC.\n\nNear horizon behaviors\n\nIn order to study the global behavior of our solution, at least for specific choices of\nparameters, and to be able to sketch the Penrose diagrams, we cast the metric into the form\napt for near horizons. With the choice V1 = V2 = 0 our metric function f (r) takes the form\n\u0013\n\u0012\n4MQL\n\u03bb1 1 \u2212 \u03b4\n1\n2\n,\n(102)\nr+\nf (r) = 2 1+\u03b4 r \u2212\nAr\n1+\u03b4\n\u03bb2 1 + \u03b4\nin which\n\n1 \u2212 \u03b12\n,\n\u03b4=\n1 + \u03b12\n\n\u22121<\u03b4 <1\n\n(103)\n\nand\nA2 =\n\n2\n\u03bb2 Q2 .\n1\u2212\u03b4\n\n(104)\n\nUpon the choice of parameters involved, we can have, double, single or no-horizon cases. By\na redefinition for time, our line element reads, in brief,\nds2 = A2 ds\u03032\nin which\nds\u03032 = \u2212\nand\n\n(105)\n\n(r \u2212 r\u2212 ) (r \u2212 r+ ) 2\nr 1+\u03b4\ndt\n+\ndr 2 + r 1+\u03b4 d\u03a92\nr 1+\u03b4\n(r \u2212 r\u2212 ) (r \u2212 r+ )\n2MQL\nr\u00b1 =\n1+\u03b4\n\n1\u00b1\n\ns\n\n\u03bb1 1 \u2212 \u03b4 2\n1\u2212\n2\n\u03bb2 4MQL\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(106)\n\n(107)\n\nWe note that the global structure of ds\u03032 is same with ds2 , and therefore we analyze ds\u03032 . The\nsingularity structure of (106) can be seen from the Kretchmann scalar-K, which reads\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 r \u22122(\u03b4+3) , \u03b4 6= \u00b11\nlim K \u223c\n(108)\nr\u21920\n\uf8f3 r \u22128 , \u03b4 = +1\n24\n\n\f\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 r \u22122(\u03b4+1) , \u03b4 6= \u00b11\nlim K \u223c\nr\u2192\u221e\n\uf8f3 constant, \u03b4 = \u22121\n\n(109)\n\nWe concentrate ourselves now to the near horizon geometry by the following reparametrization, with new coordinates (r\u0303, t\u0303)\nr\u2212 = r\u25e6 ,\n\nr+ = r\u25e6 + \u01ebb0 ,\n\nr = r\u25e6 + \u01ebr\u0303,\n\n1\nt = t\u0303\n\u01eb\n\n(110)\n\nin which r\u25e6 and b0 are constants and \u01eb \u2192 0, is a small parameter. We obtain, upon relabeling\nr\u0303 = r and t\u0303 = t\nds\u03032 = \u2212\n\nr (r \u2212 b0 ) 2\nr\u25e61+\u03b4\ndt\n+\ndr 2 + r\u25e61+\u03b4 d\u03a92 .\nr\u25e61+\u03b4\nr (r \u2212 b0 )\n\n(111)\n\nIn Fig. 4 we plot the Penrose diagrams for the specific cases b0 = 0, and b0 > 0. The case\nb0 < 0 doesn't differ from the case of b0 = 0, and as a matter of fact this particular case\ncorresponds to the BR limit, which is known to correspond to the near extreme geometry of\nthe RN black hole. The more standard BR is obtained from the present one by the inversion\nr \u2192 1r .\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have shown that dilaton field with Liouville's potential interpolates between RN\nblack hole and non-black hole BR solution. The general solution for the metric function\nsuggests that dilatonic presence induces significant changes in the solutions; for example,\nasymptotically flat black holes become non-asymptotically flat . It is shown, through radial\nlinear perturbation, that dilaton can add instabilities to the otherwise stable RN black hole\nwhereas BR remains stable. From the thermodynamic point of view also, by invoking specific\nheat the system can be tested against stability and phase transition. In the non-extreme\nLDBH case, which is a particular solution of our general solution the statistical and the\nstandard Hawking temperatures are compared and plotted. It has been pointed out that\nwith charged scalar waves and spin-weighted coupling the two results match for the case\nof double horizons. We recall that in the single horizon case, in spite of the existence of\na linear dilaton such a discrepancy does not arise. It is remarkable that the spin-weighted\nspheroidal harmonics serve to convert the diverging temperature spectrum into a finite\none. The presence of dilaton makes the spacetime highly singular at r = 0. Whether these\nsingularities are quantum mechanically singular also, or not, we send a quantum test particle\n25\n\n\fand apply the criterion due to Horowitz and Marolf. We find that under certain choice of\nour parameters the naked singularities create an infinite repulsive quantum potential so that\nthe particle feels a regular space time.\n\n[1] G. Gibbons and K.

By inversion as in (3-a) we interchange r = 0 (r \u2192 \u221e)\nwith r \u2192 \u221e (r = 0).\n\n27\n\n\fThis figure \"FIG1.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/0908.3113v2\n\n\fThis figure \"FIG2.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/0908.3113v2\n\n\fThis figure \"FIG3a.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/0908.3113v2\n\n\fThis figure \"FIG3b.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/0908.3113v2\n\n\fThis figure \"FIG3c.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/0908.3113v2\n\n\fThis figure \"FIG4a.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/0908.3113v2\n\n\fThis figure \"FIG4b.jpg\" is available in \"jpg\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/0908.3113v2\n\n\f"}
