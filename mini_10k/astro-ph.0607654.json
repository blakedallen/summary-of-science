INTRODUCTION\n\nRecent progress in reverberation mapping of type-I (broad\nemission lines) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide a reliable method for deriving the size of the broad line region\n(BLR) as a function of the optical continuum luminosity, the\nH\u03b2 line luminosity, the ultraviolet continuum luminosity and\nthe X-ray (2\u201310 keV) luminosity (Kaspi et al. 2005, hereafter\nK05 and references therein). This has been used in numerous\npapers to obtain a \"single epoch\" estimate of the black hole\n(BH) mass by combining the derived BLR size with a measure of the gas velocity obtained from emission line widths,\ne.g. FWHM(H\u03b2 ) (e.g. Netzer 2003; Vestergaard 2004; Shemmer et al. 2004, hereafter S04; Baskin and Laor 2005). There\nare obvious limitations to such methods due to the scatter in\nthe BLR size, the source luminosity and line width. These\ntranslate to a factor of 2\u20133 uncertainty on the derived masses\nwhen using the H\u03b2 line width as the velocity measure and\nthe optical continuum luminosity (\u03bb L\u03bb at 5100\u00c5, hereafter\nL5100 ) for estimating the BLR size. The uncertainty is larger,\nand perhaps systematic, when other emission lines are used.\nAdditional uncertainties are associated with the currently limited luminosity range, 1042 \u2264L5100 \u2264 1046 erg s\u22121 , thus mass\ndetermination for very luminous sources must be based on extrapolation. Notwithstanding the uncertainties, such methods\ncan provide BH mass and accretion rate in large AGN samples\nthat cannot be obtained in any other way.\nThis paper follows several earlier studies of type-I AGNs in\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; see York et al. 2000)\nspectroscopic archive. The main aims are to obtain BH\n1 School of Physics and Astronomy and the Wise Observatory, The Raymond and Beverly Sackler Faculty of Exact Sciences, Tel-Aviv University,\nTel-Aviv 69978, Israel\n2 Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr extraterrestrische Physik, Postfach 1312, 85741\nGarching, Germany\n\nmasses and accretion rates for a large number of such sources\nand to understand the time evolution and the metal content\nof the BLR gas. Earlier studies of this type include, among\nothers, McLure and Jarvis (2002) and McLure and Dunlope\n(2004). Here we use the latest SDSS public data archive and a\nmuch larger number of sources compared with earlier studies.\nThis enables us to obtain statistically significant correlations\nfor various sub-samples of the data. We also introduce new,\nmore robust methods for measuring the emission lines thus\nenabling more reliable study of metalicity and accretion rate.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In \u00a72 we introduce our\nsample and explain the method of analysis and the various\nmeasurements performed on the SDSS spectra. In \u00a73 we show\nthe more important correlations pertaining to type-I sources\nand in \u00a74 we give a discussion of the main results, including\nthe derived redshift dependent accretion rate which we compare with the known star formation rate over the same redshift\ninterval.\n2. BASIC MEASUREMENTS\n\n2.1. Sample selection\nThe present sample contains all broad line AGNs in the\nSDSS sample from data release 4 (DR4, see AdelmanMcCarthy et al. 2006 and references therein) with a redshift\ncut at z = 0.75. This more than doubles the number of such\nsources in DR3 (Schneieder et al. 2005). The sources are\ndefined as QSOs by the target selection algorithm but will be\naddressed here as type-I AGNs. The limit of 0.75 is dictated\nby the wavelength band of the SDSS spectroscopy and is designed to allow the measurement of the H\u03b2 and [O III] \u03bb 5007\nlines and the 5100\u00c5 continuum in all sources. The inclusion\nof [O III] \u03bb 5007 is required for different line velocities and\nfor omitting very few sources with such weak broad lines that\nthey are confused with type-II AGNs. The requirement on\n\n\f2\n\nNetzer and Trakhtenbrot\n\nH\u03b2 is motivated by the work of Kaspi et al. (2000) and K05\nwhich present the only available reverberation mapping sample. This low redshift sample includes H\u03b2 and L5100 measurements for 35 sources and much fewer UV line and continuum\nmeasurements. The BLR size is obtained from the measured\nH\u03b2 lag (or a combination of H \u03b1 and H\u03b2 lags) and the velocity from the observed FWHM(H\u03b2 ). Different lines have been\nused in several other papers (e.g. Vestergaard 2004; Vestergaard and Peterson 2006) yet their use is more problematic\nsince it requires a secondary calibration against H\u03b2 and L5100.\nOf the two UV lines most commonly used, Mg II \u03bb 2798 is\nprobably more reliable (e.g. McLure and Jarvis 2002; McLure\nand Dunlop 2004) and C IV \u03bb 1549 suffers from various systematic effects (Baskin and Laor 2005 and references therein).\nWe limit the present study to the use of H\u03b2 and defer the study\nof higher redshift AGNs, based on the Mg II \u03bb 2798 line, to a\nlater publication.\nThe SDSS archive (Stoughton et al. 2002) was queried for\nQSOs with z \u2264 0.75. This returned 14554 objects out of which\n1212 were found to have problematic mask data (spectra with\nmore than 30% flagged pixels; see Stoughton et al. table 11\nfor details). These objects are not included in the analysis.\nWe decided to stick with the original magnitude limit of the\nsample at the time of target selection. This means that QSOs\nwhich are fainter than i(mag)=19.1 in the TARGET database,\nbut were later added to the BEST database due to improved\nphotometry, or objects that were added to the QSO database\nafter their spectra were examined as different science targets\n(thus listed as TARGET QSO FAINT by the SDSS target selection algorithm; see \u00a74.8.4 and table 27 in Stoughton et\nal.) were not included. This removes 1927 additional sources\nfrom the sample leaving 11415 sources with i(mag) \u2264 19.1.\nThe spectra of all sources were corrected for Galactic extinction using the dust maps of Schlegel et al. (1998) and\nthe Cardelli et al. (1989) model. Next, pixels with problematic MASK values (as defined above) are replaced by local\ninterpolation and the spectra are de-redshifted and put on a\nuniform wavelength scale of 1\u00c5 per pixel.\n2.2. Line and continuum measurements\nOur work make use of the SDSS spectra as obtained from\nthe archive without any attempt to subtract the galaxy contribution. This introduces some uncertainties at the low luminosity end of the sample and is addressed below in those cases\nwhere we consider it to be important for the derived correlations. The general issue of stellar contribution to AGN spectra\nof various luminosities is discussed in Bentz et al. (2006).\nThe emission lines measured in this work are [O III] \u03bb 5007,\nH\u03b2 and the FeII line complex between the wavelengths of\n4000 and 5300\u00c5. We first fit a linear continuum between two\ncontinuum bands: 4430\u20134440\u00c5 and 5080\u20135120\u00c5. This continuum is subtracted from the spectrum and a five Gaussian\nmodel is fitted to the profiles of the two [O III] lines and H\u03b2 .\nThe [O III]\u03bb \u03bb 4959, 5007\u00c5 lines are forced to have their theoretical intensity ratio (3.0), the same FWHM and their known\nwavelengths. The H\u03b2 line is fitted with two broad Gaussians\nand a single narrow Gaussian with FWHM and wavelength\nthat agree with the [O III] lines to within 200 km s\u22121 . At this\nstage, the narrow H\u03b2 component is not allowed to exceed 0.7\nthe intensity of [O III] \u03bb 5007. The broad H\u03b2 Gaussians are\nlimited to FWHM of 1500\u20135000 km s\u22121 and a shift of up to\n500 km s\u22121 relative to [O III] \u03bb 5007. These first limits are\nnecessary in order to avoid the inclusion of some neighboring\n\nFeII lines, mostly on the blue side of the H\u03b2 profile, and to\nproperly model the broad H\u03b2 components.\nThe next step involves fitting and deblending of FeII lines.\nThe Boroson & Green (1992; hereafter BG92) Fe II emission template was convolved with a single Gaussian, which\nhas the same FWHM as the broad H\u03b2 from the previous\nfit. The resulting FeII model is fitted to the spectra over\nthe region 4400\u20134650\u00c5. This region was chosen to minimize the effect of contamination with H\u03b2 , HeII\u03bb 4686 and\n[O III] \u03bb 5007. Next we measure the contribution of the FeII\nlines to the previously defined continuum bands, subtract this\nand refit the continuum. The entire procedure is repeated\nand the newly defined FeII template is subtracted from the\ncontinuum-subtracted spectrum. This leaves us with a FeIIfree spectrum.\nThe final stage involves, again, a five Gaussian fit to the\n[O III] and H\u03b2 lines. At this stage we relax the conditions\nand allow a broader range of Gaussians (as narrow as the\n[O III] \u03bb 5007 line and as broad as 20,000 km s\u22121 ), and a\nlarger shift between the narrow H\u03b2 and [O III] \u03bb 5007 (450\nkm s\u22121 ). The 20,000 km s\u22121 limit is required since almost\nall cases exceeding this limit are found to show poor quality\nfits (see below). We also allow shifts of up to \u00b11000 km s\u22121\nbetween each of the two broad H\u03b2 components and the wavelength of the narrow H\u03b2 line. All line and continuum measurements used later in the statistical analysis are based on\nthe final stage of the fit and the second FeII fit. We found this\nmulti-stage method to be more robust, and less prone to fitting inaccuracies compared with a single-stage fit of all line\nand components.\nRegarding FWHM([O III] \u03bb 5007), we use an \"intrinsic\"\nline width which is obtained by properly subtracting a uniform instrumental line width of FWHM=140 km s\u22121 . We\nhave decided not to include in the fit the blue wing commonly\nobserved in the line profile. This removes a potential complication due to blending with the broad H\u03b2 profile and is also\nin line with earlier measures of the line in type-I and type-II\nsources. As explained in Greene & Ho (2005), a single component [O III] \u03bb 5007 line is a good indicator of \u03c3\u2217 . This point\nis further discussed in \u00a73.5. We do not include in the analysis the He II \u03bb 4686 line which is clearly seen in many of the\nsources.\nAs for the broad H\u03b2 line, we measure its rest equivalent\nwidth (EW(H\u03b2 )) and FWHM(H\u03b2 ) and also divide the combined line profile into two parts, at the rest wavelength of\n4862\u00c5 (as determined by the wavelength of [O III] \u03bb 5007).\nThe line flux is then measured in each part. We note that\nsome earlier works followed BG92 and use EW(FeII) as a\nreplacement for the iron line intensities. Here we define\nL(FeII) by integrating the line flux over the wavelength range\nof 4434\u20134684\u00c5 (e.g. S04). In what follows FeII/H\u03b2 stands\nfor L(FeII)/L(H\u03b2 ).\nThe automated procedure to measure line and continuum\nfluxes suffers from various problems and limitations, some\nthat are difficult to cure. To allow better control of the fit\nresults, we make use of the R2 and \u03c7 2 statistics (both per degree of freedom). These are combined in various ways to reject sources that do not fall within the predefined limits of\nR2 > 0.2 and \u03c7 2 < 5. A common problem is encountered in\nweak flux sources with very large FWHM(H\u03b2 ). In many of\nthese cases, mostly those at small redshift, the stellar contribution to L5100 is of the same order as the non-stellar continuum. The poor signal-to-noise (S/N) in some of those makes\n\n\fMass accretion rate and metalicity in AGNs\n\n3\n\nterson 2006; Bentz et al. 2006) suggest a flatter slope (0.52)\nbased on improved host galaxy subtraction in several of the\nlow luminosity sources in the K05 sample, and the omission\nof several sources from the original list. We note that the\ninclusion of all the K05 sources in the Bentz et al. (2006)\nanalysis, using the BCES method (see the Bentz et al. paper\nfor explanation and their Table 1 for results) gives a slope of\n0.57 \u00b1 0.08 which is entirely consistent with the K05 slope of\n0.66 \u00b1 0.07. Moreover, there are other reasons for choosing a\nslope steeper than 0.52, e.g. using L(H\u03b2 ) as a proxy for the\nUV continuum luminosity (which is not affected by the host\ngalaxy subtraction) gives such a slope. Finally, removing several of the faintest sources from the K05 sample also justifies\nthis slope. For example, in 91% of the sources in our sample L5100 > 1043.5 erg s\u22121 . Thus it is justified not to include\nthe K05 sources with L5100< 1043.5 erg s\u22121 when searching\nfor the most suitable reverberation mapping relationship for\nthe SDSS sample (this also avoids complications due to host\ngalaxy contamination).

Accretion rate vs. redshift\nThe correlation of L/LEdd with redshift for the entire sample, as well as for the two mass groups, is shown Fig. 2. The\ndiagram shows also two computed lower limits for each of the\ntwo groups corresponding to the flux limits of the two mass\nboundaries. The visual impression is somewhat misleading\nsince much of the apparent correlation is due to the lower limit\non L/LEdd resulting from the flux limits on the various mass\ngroups. The presence of such flux limits considerably complicate the analysis and we have searched for rigorous ways\nto derived the intrinsic z-L/LEdd dependence. Below we detail the two methods that were used, the peak of the L/LEdd\ndistribution and the Efron and Petrosian (1992) truncated permutation test.\n3.1.1. The peak distribution method\nWe first study the distribution of L/LEdd in several redshifts\nbins that are just wide enough to include a reasonable number\nof sources. These histograms (see Fig. 3) are used to define\nthe peak and the envelope of the L/LEdd vs. redshift relationship. The bins are defined such that \u2206z/z = 0.1 and include\nfrom 50 to 230 sources, with an average number of about 120\nsources per bin.\nSuch a procedure is only meaningful if the peak of the distribution is clearly defined, i.e. if the value of L/LEdd corresponding to the maximum number of sources is larger than\n\nL/LEdd\n\n1\n\n.1\n\n.01\n\n.1\nz\n\nF IG . 2.- L/LEdd vs. redshift for our SDSS sample of type-I RQ-AGNs.\nThe solid lines represent the limiting accretion rates obtained from the flux\nlimits for the two mass groups (see text).

The lower boundary at each redshift\nis a clear manifestation of the strong correlation of M(BH)\nand L5100 in our flux limited sample. The diagram is very\nsimilar to the one presented in McLure & Dunlope (2004)\nwhere a smaller sample and somewhat different expressions\nfor deriving M(BH) and L/LEdd have been used. Here, and\nin several other diagrams, we focus on two mass groups that\nare marked in two different colors: 107.5\u22127.8 M\u2299 (red, 1207\nsources) and 108.5\u22128.8 M\u2299 (blue, 1422 sources).\nMcLure and Jarvis (2004) used a sample of about 6,000\nSDSS QSOs to investigated the mass of the central BHs as\na function of radio properties. They found that RL-QSOs\nhost, on the average, more massive BH for a given optical\ncontinuum luminosity. The mean M(BH) difference between\nRL-AGNs and RQ-AGNs found by those authors is 0.16 dex.\nThis was attributed to the larger mean FWHM(H\u03b2 ) in radio\nloud sources. We checked these findings by comparing the\nluminosity, BH mass and L/LEdd for the two populations in\nour z \u2264 0.75 sample. Using the medians of all properties,\nwe find a difference of 0.11 dex in L5100, a factor of 1.06 in\nFWHM(H\u03b2 ), and a difference of 0.15 dex in M(BH) (the differences in the mean are somewhat larger). The difference in\nM(BH) is, of course, the result of the differences in luminosity\nand line width between the two populations (see eq. 1).\nFig. 1 also shows L/LEdd vs. M(BH) for the RQ-AGN sample as well as for the two mass groups. The low accretion rate\nlimit is determined, mostly, by the flux limit of the sample.\nThus, we expect that more object with small L/LEdd are missing at higher redshifts. The highest accretion rate sources in\neach mass group are not affected by this limit. Based of these\nsources we confirms that the lowest mass BHs are the fastest\naccretors, a result that was already noted by McLure and Dunlop(2004).\n\n8.5\n\nM=10\n\nz=0.3\n\n8.8\n\n\u2212 10\n\nz=0.5 z=0.7\n\n.2\n.1\n0\n\n.3\nFraction\n\n4\n\n7.5\n\nM=10\n\n7.8\n\n\u2212 10\n\nz=0.3\n.2\n\nz=0.5\n\nz=0.1\n\n.1\n0\n.01\n\n.1\nL/LEdd\n\n1\n\nF IG . 3.- L/LEdd histograms for various redshift bands, as marked, for the\nlow (bottom) and high (top) mass groups.

As evident from the diagram, the peaks of the\nL/LEdd distribution in the lower mass group (bottom part of\nthe diagram) are only meaningful for z \u2264 0.3.

The\nz=0.2 histogram (not shown here) can also be used to define\nthe peak.\nAs an independent check on the slope of the correlation\nin those redshift intervals where the peak distribution can be\nidentified, we also used the upper envelope of the distribution\nwhich we define by the fifth largest L/LEdd (the number of\nsources with larger L/LEdd is so small in some groups that\nwe suspect incomplete sampling). Obviously, the upper envelop is not affected by the flux limit of the sample. However, the redshift bins must contain enough sources to justify\nthis method. This may be a problem for very high luminosity\nsources at low redshift because of the limited area covered by\nthe SDSS sample.\nThe results of the test are shown in Fig. 4. We also show\nthe peaks of the distribution for a third mass group, with\nM= 106.8\u22127.2 M\u2299 , for those redshifts where the peak of the\nL/LEdd distribution is higher than the flux limit of this group.\nIn this mass range, this is only true for z < 0.25 since there\nare very few such low mass sources at higher redshifts because of the flux limit. The results can be presented as simple power-laws in redshift ranging from L/LEdd \u221d z0.8 for for\nM(BH)=107 M\u2299 to about L/LEdd \u221d z2.2 for M(BH)=108.6 M\u2299 .\nGiven the small number of points in the various redshift intervals, and the differences between the slopes obtained from\nthe peaks and the envelopes of the various histograms, we estimate an uncertainty of about 0.3 on the slopes obtained with\nthis method.\n3.1.2. The truncated permutation test\nThe determination of bivariate distributions from truncated\nastronomical data is a well known problem. Such data sets\nare very common and the flux limited sample considered here\nis only one such example. The problem is to test such truncated bivariate data sets for statistical independence without a\npriori knowledge of the real underlying correlation. This issue is discussed in great detail by Efron & Petrosian (1992;\nsee this paper for earlier attempts to address this issue) who\nsuggest powerful nonparametric permutation tests that can be\napplied to data sets of this type. The paper describes tests for\nnontruncated as well as truncated data sets and apply them to\n\ntwo astronomical cases that are rather similar to the sample\nin question. In particular, they describe a rank-based statistics\nthat is powerful, robust and easily administrated to data sets\nlike ours.\nThe normalized rank statistic of Efron and Petrosian (1992),\nTi , is used to define a test statistic\ntw (data) = \u03a3i wi Ti /(\u03a3i w2i )1/2 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere w\u030c= (w1 , w2 , ....wn ) is a vector of weights. tw (data) has\nmean 0 and variance 1 and is distributed normally thus allowing to obtain the best value and the confidence limits using\nthe normal approximation (see Efron & Petrosian 1992 \u00a73 for\nmore details and definitions). The choice made here, and recommended also in Efron & Petrosian (1992), assumes equal\nweights for all points, i.e. w\u030c= (1, 1, ....1). The application of\nthe permutation test involves a guess of the real distribution\nwhich recovers the null hypothesis of independence between\nthe two variables in questions (in our case L/LEdd and z).\nWe have used truncated permutation tests to check two families of ad hoc luminosity redshift dependences:\n\nand\n\nL/LEdd \u221d z\u03b3 (M) ,\n\n(4)\n\nL/LEdd \u221d (1 + z)\u03b4 (M) .\n\n(5)\n\nThis involved changing the guessed values of \u03b3 and \u03b4 , for various mass groups, and looking for their best values (i.e. those\n\u03b3 and \u03b4 resulting in tw = 0) as well as the 90% confidence\nlimits (those value giving tw = \u22121.645 and tw = 1.645). The\nmass groups used were limited to be 0.2 dex wide except for\nthe lowest mass group, around M(BH)=107 M\u2299 , where the\nsmall number of objects dictates a wider range (0.4 dex). The\nresults are listed in Table 1 where we also specify the redshift\nrange for each group (the largest mass group contains no objects at small z and the lowest mass group contains very few\nsources at z > 0.25 hence the need to define a redshift range).\nThe results of the test are shown in Fig. 4 for the case of\neqn. 4. They are consistent with the results of the peak distribution method and lend support to the interpretation that\nthe peak of the distribution has indeed been recovered for the\nmass groups and redshift intervals discussed above. These results are further discussed and compared with the cosmic star\nformation rate in \u00a74.2\n3.2. FeII/H\u03b2 and iron abundance\nFig. 5 shows the dependence of FeII/H\u03b2 on L/LEdd for our\nsample of type-I SDSS AGNs. As clear from the diagram, and\nhas been verified by standard regression analysis, FeII/H\u03b2\nand L/LEdd are significantly correlated and larger L/LEdd are\nassociated with stronger FeII and/or weaker H\u03b2 lines.

Such a correlation has been suspected in the past and\nhas studied in several previous papers (see Netzer et al. 2004\nand references therein). However, it was never tested in such\na large sample and over the entire 0\u20130.75 redshift range.\nWe have also studied the dependence of FeII/H\u03b2 on redshift in the entire sample as well as in the various mass\ngroups. Simple linear regression suggests that, for RQ-AGNs,\nFeII/H\u03b2 \u221d z\u22120.22\u00b10.02. The slope is somewhat steeper for RL\nsources (\u22120.38 \u00b1 0.07) and for the mass group of 107.7\u22127.8\nM\u2299 objects (\u22120.40 \u00b1 0.05). The large number of points in all\nthose groups of sources results in formally significant correlations. However, detailed examination shows that the results\ndepend strongly on the measured FeII/H\u03b2 at the low redshift\nlow luminosity end of the distribution. As explained in \u00a72.2,\nsome of these cases, especially those with extremely broad\nlines, are difficult to measure and are therefore uncertain because of the large stellar contribution. There are indeed differences in the mean FeII/H\u03b2 between the z < 0.2 and z > 0.5\nredshift bins but not a smooth continuous change as a function of redshift. In view of this, we consider the evidence for\nredshift dependence of FeII/H\u03b2 as marginal. This uncertainty\ndoes not affect the FeII/H\u03b2 vs. L/LEdd correlation discussed\nearlier.\nThe modeling of FeII line formation in AGN clouds is extremely complicated. It involves hundreds of energy levels\nand thousands of transitions. Earlier detailed studies by Netzer and Wills (1983) and Wills, Netzer & Wills (1985), that\nincluded most of the important atomic processes, reached the\nconclusion that the FeII line intensities are too uncertain to\nbe used as iron abundance indicators. Major improvements\nin atomic data (Sigut & Pradhan 2003), combined with improved treatment of some of the line excitation processes\n(Baldwin et al. 2004), resulted in a better understanding of\nseveral strong FeII features but changed little with regard to\nthe main conclusion: there are several mechanisms capable\nof enhancing FeII emission relative to the hydrogen Balmer\nlines and increased iron abundance is only one of them .\nThe correlation shown in Fig. 5 provides a new way to\nsolve the iron abundance problem. As shown in S04, the N/C\nabundance (and metalicity in general) as measured from the\nN V \u03bb 1240/C IV \u03bb 1549 line ratio (Hamann et al. 2002 and\nreferences therein) is strongly correlated with L/LEdd over a\nlarge luminosity range. This result is in conflict with the ear-\n\nlier studies by Hamann and Ferland (1993; 1999) who suggested that the N/C ratio depends on source luminosity (see\nalso Dietrich et al. 2002; Dietrich et al. 2003 for the possible\ndependence on M(BH)). The S04 finding is based mostly on\nthe high metalicity of low luminosity narrow line Seyfert 1\ngalaxies (NLS1s) that do not fall on the original Hamann and\nFerland (1993) correlation (Shemmer and Netzer 2002). The\nhigh metalicity of NLS1s gains further support by the detailed\nanalysis of the absorption line spectrum of Mrk 1044 (Fields\net al. 2005).\nGiven the dependence of metalicity on L/LEdd , and the correlation of FeII/H\u03b2 with L/LEdd shown in Fig. 5, we suggest\nthat FeII/H\u03b2 is an iron abundance indicator for all sources\n> 0.03. This conclusion does not rely on uncerwith L/LEdd \u223c\ntain atomic models and complicated radiative transfer in photoionized BLR clouds. It is based on observed correlations\nin large AGN samples. There is no accurate way to calibrating the iron-to-hydrogen abundance because of the uncertain\nmodeling. However, we can compare this relationship to the\nS04 correlation of N V \u03bb 1240/C IV \u03bb 1549 vs. L/LEdd (their\nFig. 6). The comparison shows that the slopes of the two\ncorrelations are similar. For example, the use of the BCES\nmethod with the assumption of a uniform error of 0.1 dex\nin both axes gives FeII/H\u03b2 \u221dL/LEdd 0.7 . Assuming that Fe/H\nscales with O/H, and using the Hamann et al. (2002) calculation to calibrate N/C vs. metalicity, we find that solar Fe/H\ncorresponds to FeII/H\u03b2 \u2243 0.6.\n3.3. The growth time of massive black holes\nNext we assume that BH growth is dominated by gas accretion and BH mergers are of secondary importance. Given\nthis assumption, we can calculate the growth time using the\nSalpeter (1964) original expression as\n\u03b7 /(1 \u2212 \u03b7 )\nM\n1\ntgrow = 4 \u00d7 108\nlog\nyr ,\n(6)\nL/LEdd\nMseed factive\nwhere factive is the fraction of time the BH is active. For simplicity we assume a mass independent accretion efficiency of\n\u03b7 = 0.2, to reflect the assumption of a non-zero angular velocity BHs, and a relatively large seed BH mass of Mseed = 104\nM\u2299 . Obviously there is a range in both properties (e.g. Heger\nand Woosley, 2002; Ohkubo et al. 2006) but the analysis is not\nvery sensitive to either of those provided Mseed is not much\nlarger than assumed here.\nGiven the above growth time, and assuming, factive = 1, we\ncan calculate for each BH the time required to grow to its observed mass relative to the age of the universe at the observed\nredshift, tgrow /tuniverse . This is shown in Fig. 6 for all sources\nas functions of both L/LEdd and redshift. Evidently, most\n(66%) BHs did not have enough time to grow to their measured mass given their observed accretion rate. The fraction of\nsuch sources found here is, of course, an upper limit, since all\nBHs missing from our sample, due to their very small L/LEdd\nand the SDSS flux limit, also belong in this group of objects.\nGiven the assumption of growth by accretion, we find that in\nthe majority of cases, there must have been one or more past\nepisodes where the accretion rate was higher than the value\nmeasured here. As shown in \u00a74 below, this conclusion is of\nmajor importance in understanding the time dependent metal\nenrichment in AGNs.\n3.4. Redefining narrow line type-I AGNs (NLAGN1s)\nThe subgroup of NLS1s is usually assumed to contain\nAGNs with the largest accretion rates (e.g. Grupe et al. 2004\n\n\fMass accretion rate and metalicity in AGNs\n\n7\n\n8\n1\n\nnarrow\u2212line type\u2212I AGNs\n(NLAGN1s)\n\nL/LEdd\n\nt(grow)/t(universe)\n\n6\n\n4\n\n.1\n\n2\n.01\n\nbroad\u2212line type\u2212I AGNs\n\n0\n.01\n\n.1\nL/LEdd\n\n1\n\n.1\n\n1\n\n1000\n\nz\n\nF IG . 6.- BH growth-time, relative to the age of the universe, as a function of L/LEdd (left) and redshift (right). Objects above the horizontal line at\nt(grow)/t(universe)=1 must have had past episodes of faster accretion. Symbols are the same as those of Fig.1.\n\nand references therein). Such sources were first discussed in\nOsterbrock and Pogge (1985) who introduced the defining criteria of FWHM(H\u03b2 )\u2264 2000 km s\u22121 . NLS1s are known to\nhave other extreme properties such as extremely steep soft Xray continuum and larger than average FeII/H\u03b2 .\nThe recent study by S04 includes H and K-band spectroscopy of about 30 high redshift, very high luminosity AGNs. In most of these sources L/LEdd > 0.4 yet\nFWHM(H\u03b2 ) is much larger than 2000 km s\u22121 . These authors suggested that the defining criteria for NLS1s should be\nmass and luminosity dependent thus reflecting the fundamental physics affecting the line width. This approach is different\nfrom the one taken by McLure and Dunlop (2004) who assumed the boundary between the groups of narrow and broad\nline type-I AGNs is at 2000 km s\u22121 , independent of luminosity. Given this assumption, they did not find a larger fraction\nof NLS1s among the highest luminosity sources in their sample.\nOur SDSS sample contains a large enough range in both\nM(BH) and L/LEdd to study the S04 suggestion in more detail. To illustrate this we plot in Fig. 7 accretion rates as a\nfunction of FWHM(H\u03b2 ) for all sources and shaw, on the same\ndiagram, the two mass groups introduced earlier and 31 high\nredshift sources from S04. The median mass for the third\ngroup is about 3 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 and the median L5100 about 1046.6\nerg s\u22121 (an orders of magnitude larger than the most luminous z \u2264 0.75 SDSS sources). The diagram shows also a line\nat L/LEdd =0.25 that intersects the various subgroups at different line widths. At small z, this line is consistent with the\nOsterbrock & Pogge (1985) definition of NLS1s in terms of\ncontinuum luminosity and BH mass. We suggest that this line\nis a more physical measure of a general group of \"narrow line\ntype-I AGN\" (hereafter NLAGN1s). Using eqns. 1 and 2 with\nfL = 7, and normalizing the relationship to have a boundary\nat L/LEdd =0.25, we get either a luminosity-based definition,\n\u00150.175\n\u0014\nL5100\nkm s\u22121\n(7)\nFW HM(Hbeta ) \u2264 1870\n1044 erg s\u22121\nor a definition based on black hole mass,\n\u00150.175\n\u0014\nM\nkm s\u22121 .\nFW HM(Hbeta ) \u2264 1700\n107 M\u2299\n\n10000\nFWHM(H\u03b2)\n\n(8)\n\nF IG . 7.- A new definion of narrow line type-I RQ-AGN (NLAGN1s)\nbased on accretion rate.

FWHM([O III] \u03bb 5007) as a black hole mass indicator\nThe discovery of a tight correlation between black hole\nmass and the stellar bulge velocity dispersion (\u03c3\u2217 ) resulted\nin several attempts to investigate secondary mass indicators related to emission line widths (\u03c3g ). This is particularly important in those cases where the strong non-stellar\ncontinuum prevents the measurement of \u03c3\u2217 . For example,\nFWHM([O III] \u03bb 5007) has been suggested as a proxy for \u03c3\u2217\nin type-I AGNs (e.g. Nelson 2000; Shields et al. 2003; Grupe\n& Mathur 2004; Boroson 2003; Boroson 2005).\nBoroson (2003) used a small subsample of 107 objects with z < 0.4 from the early release SDSS data to\nstudy the FWHM([O III] \u03bb 5007) vs. \u03c3\u2217 relationship. The\nFWHM([O III] \u03bb 5007) in this study was measured from the\nobserved line profile with no profile fitting. He finds a real\ncorrelation between FWHM([O III] \u03bb 5007) and the BH mass\nwith a flattening of the relationship at higher luminosity and\na very large scatter (a factor of \u223c 5). In a later publication,\nBoroson (2005) revisited the same problem using a larger\nsample (about 400 sources) covering the same redshift interval and focusing on the systemic velocity indicated by the\n[O III] \u03bb 5007 line center. He finds a systematic blueshift of\nthe line peak with a magnitude which is correlated with the\nline width and with L/LEdd . An extensive discussion of the\nmerit of such techniques, including an analysis of a large sample (1749 object) of type-II AGNs, with a median redshift of\n0.1, where both \u03c3\u2217 and the width of several narrow emission\nlines have been measured, is given in Greene & Ho (2005).\nAccording to these authors, FWHM([O III] \u03bb 5007)/2.35 is a\ngood proxy for \u03c3\u2217 provided the strong line core, without the\ncommonly observed extended blue wing, is used to define\nFWHM([O III] \u03bb 5007). Greene & Ho further suggested that\ndeviations between \u03c3\u2217 and FWHM([O III] \u03bb 5007)/2.35 are related to L/LEdd . Large deviation probably reflect non-virial\nmotions due to a strong radiation field. The [O III] \u03bb 5007 line\nluminosity has also been used as a primary bolometric luminosity indicator for type-II AGNs (e.g. Heckman et al. 2004)\nwhose non-stellar continuum cannot be directly observed. As\nshown by Netzer et al. (2006), this is associated with a large\nscatter, and perhaps also a luminosity and/or redshift dependence.\nOur SDSS sample is different from all earlier ones by being\n\n\f8\n\nNetzer and Trakhtenbrot\nTABLE 2\nF IT COEFFICIENTS FOR M(BH) VS .

The entire RQ sample\nis plotted as small points in both panels and the objects belonging to the\nspecific redshift group are plotted as large black symbols. The two lines in\neach panel are best fit curves for the redshift group in question (solid line)\nand the Tremaine et al. (2002) fit to the M(BH)-\u03c3\u2217 relationship (dashed line).\nThe two fits are basically identical for the z=0.1\u20130.2 group.\n\nmuch larger and by covering a wider redshift range. It can\nthus be used to test the earlier findings regarding type-I AGNs\nat higher luminosities and redshifts and with a better statistics. Unlike Boroson (2003; 2005) and Greene & Ho (2005),\nwe do not restrict ourselves to high S/N spectra and attempt\nto fit all sources with a detectable [O III] \u03bb 5007 line. As explained in \u00a72.2, our FWHM([O III] \u03bb 5007) is based on a single Gaussian fit to the core of the line, similar to the method\nof Greene & Ho (2005). We have correlated these measurements with M(BH) and L/LEdd measured here and show the\nresults in Fig 8 as M(BH) vs. FWHM([O III] \u03bb 5007) for the\nentire sample as well as for two redshift groups: z=0.1\u20130.2\nand z=0.4\u20130.6. To guide the eye, we have calculated the best\nslope for each of the groups using the BCES method assuming a uniform error of 0.1 dex and plot them on the diagram\ntogether with a curve representing the Tremaine et al. (2002)\nparametrization of the M(BH)-\u03c3\u2217 relationship.\nFig. 8 clearly shows the non-linear dependence of\nlog(M(BH)) on log(FWHM([O III] \u03bb 5007)). Expressing the\ncorrelation as M(BH)\u221dFWHM([O III] \u03bb 5007)\u03b1 (z) we find a\nrange of \u03b1 (z) as listed in Table 2. As evident from the table,\nthe slope is decreasing with redshift and the correlation becomes insignificant at z > 0.5. As a curiosity, the agreement\nwith the Tremaine et al. (2002) best slope (\u03b1 = 4.02) is almost perfect over the redshift interval of 0.1\u20130.2 (see bottom\npanel of diagram). We suspect that the overall agreement between \u03c3\u2217 and FWHM([O III] \u03bb 5007)/2.35 found by Grupe &\nMathur (2004) and by Greene & HO (2005), is the result of\nthose samples being dominated by low redshift sources.\nHigh accretion rate can also influence the [O III] \u03bb 5007\n\nAS DEFINED\n\n\u03b1 (z)\nL/LEdd \u03b2 (L/LEdd )\n5.8 \u00b1 1.5 0.01\u20130.03 3.4 \u00b1 0.1\n4.0 \u00b1 0.6 0.10\u20130.15 2.7 \u00b1 0.7\n1.6 \u00b1 0.2 0.30\u20130.50 2.1 \u00b1 0.2\n1.5 \u00b1 0.9\nall\n2.9 \u00b1 0.4\n\nline width by introducing a non-virial component to the\nline profile, perhaps due to acceleration by radiation pressure force. This has been studied by Netzer et al. (2004),\nBoroson (2005) and Greene & Ho (2005). Netzer et\nal. found that FWHM([O III] \u03bb 5007) correlates with L5100 ,\nM(BH) and L/LEdd but the dependence on L/LEdd is weaker\nthan the dependences on the luminosity and the mass. To\ncheck this in the present case, we divided the SDSS sample into groups according to L/LEdd and assumed that\nM(BH)\u221dFWHM([O III] \u03bb 5007)\u03b2 (L/LEdd ) . We find a clear decrease of \u03b2 with L/LEdd . The computed values are given\nin Table 2. Thus, larger L/LEdd results in a flatter M(BH)FWHM([O III] \u03bb 5007) relationship.\nThe\nredshift\ndependence\nof\nthe\nM(BH)FWHM([O III] \u03bb 5007) relationship can be explained in\nseveral ways. First, selection effects must be important\nas more and more low mass, low luminosity and small\nL/LEdd sources drop from the sample at higher redshifts.\nWe suspect that the paucity of small mass black holes at\nhigh redshifts cannot explain the entire change as the overall\nrange in M(BH) at z > 0.5 is quite large (about 1.3 dex).\nThe increasing number of high L/LEdd sources is probably\nmore important as this tends to flatten the relationship. This\nis in line with the Greene & Ho (2005) suggestion and was\ntested quantitatively by using their recipe (their eqn. 1) to\ncorrect the observed FWHM([O III] \u03bb 5007) for L/LEdd . The\nprocedure results in a somewhat better agreement with the\nTremaine et al. (2002) relationship over part (but not all)\nof the range in FWHM([O III] \u03bb 5007). This by itself does\nnot explain the observed spread. We conclude that on top\nof a large intrinsic spread in all quantities related to the\n[O III] \u03bb 5007 line, there are also systematic effects that limit,\nseverely, the usefulness of this approach. Thus, the methods\nused to obtain bolometric luminosity and BH mass from the\nluminosity and the width of the [O III] \u03bb 5007 line suffer from\na large scatter and, perhaps, systematic uncertainties.\nAn interesting idea is a real redshift evoluIn this case,\ntion of the M(BH)-\u03c3\u2217 relationship.\nFWHM([O III] \u03bb 5007)/2.35 can be used as a surrogate\nfor \u03c3\u2217 at small z yet the non-parallel evolution of the bulge\nand the BH mass requires a modification at larger redshifts.\nFurther discussion of this idea is beyond the scope of the\npaper.\n3.6. Other correlations\nThe SDSS sample is an invaluable source for studying several other correlations of line and continuum properties in\ntype-I AGNs. Such a study goes beyond the scope of the\npresent work that focuses on mass, accretion rate and metalicity as a function of redshift. Since most those correlations\ncan easily be computed, we list them below, with only a brief\n\n\fMass accretion rate and metalicity in AGNs\nTABLE 3\nC ORRELATIONS WITH A CHANCE PROBABILITY SMALLER THAN 10\u22125\n\nProperty A\nEW(H\u03b2 )\nEW(H\u03b2 )\nEW(H\u03b2 )\nEW(FeII)\nEW(FeII)\nEW(FeII)\nFeII/H\u03b2\nFeII/H\u03b2\nFeII/H\u03b2\nFeII/H\u03b2\nH\u03b2 (red)/H\u03b2 (total)\nH\u03b2 (red)/H\u03b2 (total)\nH\u03b2 (red)/H\u03b2 (total)\nH\u03b2 (red)/H\u03b2 (total)\n\nProperty B RQ-AGNs RL-AGNs M(BH)=107.5\u22127.8 M\u2299\nL5100\n+\nM(BH)\n+\n+\nL/LEdd\n\u2212\n\u2212\nL5100\n+\n+\nM(BH)\n\u2212\n\u2212\nL/LEdd\n+\n+\n+\nL5100\n\u2212\n+\nM(BH)\n\u2212\n\u2212\nL/LEdd\n+\n+\n+\nEW(H\u03b2 )\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\nL5100\n+\n+\n+\nM(BH)\n+\n+\nEW(H\u03b2 )\n+\n+\n+\nFeII/H\u03b2\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\ndiscussion and leave the more detailed investigation to a forthcoming publication.\nTable 3 shows the results of our Spearman rank correlation analysis for several line and continuum properties. Significant correlations, with a chance probability smaller than\n10\u22125, are marked by either a + or a \u2212, depending on the slope\nof the correlation. In particular, we find a negative Baldwin\nrelationship (Baldwin 1977) for both H\u03b2 and the FeII lines.\nThe former has already been found by Croom et al. (2004)\nin their study of the 2dF AGN sample. We also find a tendency for the fractional luminosity of the red part of the H\u03b2\nline (measured relative to the position of [O III] \u03bb 5007) to increase with continuum luminosity. This is an opposite trend\nto the well known blue shift of the C IV \u03bb 1549 line in high\nluminosity sources and does not seem to be associated with\nL/LEdd . We note that the definition of the systemic velocity is\na bit ambiguous since we rely on the measured wavelength of\nthe [O III] \u03bb 5007 line. Yet, this lines was shown by Boroson\n(2005) to have a noticeable blueshift in large L/LEdd AGNs.\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nThe main new results presented here are the measurement\nof the accretion rate, in several mass groups, as a function of\nredshift and the correlation between black hole growth rate\nand BLR metalicity.\n4.1. Black hole growth and BLR metalicity\nThe new results concerning the iron abundance and the\ngrowth time can be combined to infer the changes in the\nmetal abundance of the BLR gas as a function of time. Since\nFeII/H\u03b2 is an iron abundance indicator which depends on\nL/LEdd , and since most type-I AGNs had higher accretion\nrate episodes in their past, we cannot avoid the conclusion that\nthose past episodes were characterized by enhanced metalicity relative to the one measured here. Computing BH growth\ntimes for the 31 high luminosity sources in S04, and noting the\ndependence of N/C on L/LEdd found by those authors, results\nin a similar conclusion, despite of the much larger redshifts\nof these sources. Thus, BLR metalicity can go through cycles\nand is not monotonously decreasing with decreasing redshift.\nThe emerging picture of a complex metalicity, accretion\n\n9\n\nrate and cosmic time dependences is not easy to explain. One\npossibility is that episodes of fast accretion onto the central\nBH are associated with enhanced, large scale star formation\nepisodes that lead to increased metalicity throughout the host\ngalaxy or at least in its central kpc. If the enriched material finds its way to the center of the system, increasing both\nL/LEdd and the metal content of the BLR, it would explain\nall observed properties. Such a scenario must also involve\nejection and/or accretion of the enriched gas toward the end\nof the active phase such that the metal content of the BLR at\nlater times, when the fast accretion phase is over, is reduced\nrelative to the peak activity phase. The formation of enriched\nBLR clouds from the wind of an enriched accretion disk is\njust one of several such possibilities.\nThe (somewhat uncertain) dependence of FeII/H\u03b2 on redshift suggests that the general, time averaged BLR iron abundance is slowly increasing with cosmic time while undergoing much larger fluctuations associated with the fast accretion\nrate episodes. Finally, if the time scale of channeling such enriched starburst gas into the center is short compared with one\nepisode of BH growth, we would expect to see strong starburst\nactivity associated with the BH activity in many AGNs.\n4.2. Black hole growth and cosmic star formation\nOur new results clearly show the changes in BH mass and\naccretion rate with redshift. For example, the histograms\nshown in Fig. 3 clearly illustrate that the smaller BHs are the\nfastest accretors at all redshifts studied here although large\nmass BHs at high z can accrete as fast as small mass BHs at\nlow z.\nGiven the results shown in Fig. 4 and listed in Table 1, we\ncan compare the BH accretion rates found here and the known\nstar formation rate over the redshift interval of 0\u20130.75. For\nthis we use eqns. 4 and 5 and various publications describing\nevolutionary models and star formation rate measurements\n(e.g. Chary & Elbaz 2001 and references therein). A simple\nfit to some of those results gives \u03c1\u2217 \u221d z\u03b3 or \u03c1\u2217 \u221d (1+z)\u03b4 where\n1.4 < \u03b3 < 2 and 6 < \u03b4 < 9. The large range of slopes represents the uncertainties on the data as well as on the various\nevolutionary models (see Chary & Elbaz 2001 for more information). This is a universal rate averaged over all starburst\ngalaxies of all morphologies and luminosities. The range of\nslopes is somewhat narrower than the one found here for BH\ngrowth rates (Table 1) and the middle of the range is in rough\nagreement with the growth rate of M=108 M\u2299 BHs. Thus, the\naverage BH growth rate for z \u2264 0.75 AGNs seems to agree\nwith the star formation rate over the same redshift interval.\nMarconi et al. (2004) used a detailed modeling of several observed AGN luminosity functions to argue that accretion onto BHs, integrated over the entire AGN population, proceeds at a rate similar to the star formation rate at\nsmall redshifts. Their model fitting to the data over the redshift range 0\u20130.6, assuming L/LEdd =1, can be described by\nL(all AGN) \u221d (1 + z)4.2 (A. Marconi, private communication). Obviously, the Marconi et al. (2004) results cannot\nbe directly compared with ours. Their total accretion rate (i.e.\nluminosity) was calculated for the entire AGN population and\nthe redshift dependence was obtained under the assumption\nof a uniform L/LEdd .\nThe new results shown here go one step further by neglecting the uniform L/LEdd assumption and by demonstrating that\ndifferent mass groups are characterized by different growth\nrates. A more detailed comparison between the two stud-\n\n\f10\n\nNetzer and Trakhtenbrot\n\nies requires an additional information about sources that are\nmissing from the SDSS data but are found in X-ray selected\nsamples.
