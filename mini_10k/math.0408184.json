These are\n3\u2013manifolds M which admit a differentiable map f : M \u2192 F to a surface F such\nthat every fiber is a circle. There are finitely many points p1 , . . . , pn \u2208 F such that\nM is a circle bundle over F \\ {p1 , . . . , pn }, and the fibers over pi naturally appear\nwith some multiplicty mi . It is the orbifold Euler charactersitic\nX\neorb (F, (p1 , m1 ), . . . , (pn , mn )) := e(F ) \u2212\n(1 \u2212 m1i )\nthat by and large determines the geometry of M . For instance, M has spherical\ngeometry iff eorb > 0 and H1 (M, Q) = 0 (see, for instance, [Sco83]).\nHigher dimensional Seifert fibered manifolds were introduced and investigated\nin [OW75]. Roughly speaking, these are (2n + 1)\u2013manifolds L which admit a\ndifferentiable map f : L \u2192 X to a complex n-manifold X such that every fiber is a\ncircle. Insisting that the base of a Seifert bundle be a complex manifold seems very\nartificial from the topological point of view, but a remarkable result a Kobayashi\n[Kob63] implies that for our purposes this is necessary. (See (12) for a precise\nstatement.)\nThe natural setting seems to be to study Seifert bundles f : L \u2192 X, where the\nbase is a complex locally cylic orbifold. That is, locally it looks like Cn /G where G\nis a cyclic group acting linearly. There is a divisor \u222aDi \u2282 X such that L \u2192 X is a\ncircle bundle over X \\ \u222aDi and there are naturalP\nmultiplicities mi are assigned to\nthe fibers over each Di , see (14). We call \u2206 := (1 \u2212 m1i )Di the branch divisor,\nand we denote the base orbifold by (X, \u2206). The key invariant is the orbifold Chern\nclass\nX\ncorb\n(1 \u2212 m1i )[Di ] \u2208 H 2 (X, Q).\n1 (X, \u2206) := c1 (X) \u2212\nAnother invariant, which enters into the final picture surprisingly little, is the Chern\nclass of the Seifert bundle c1 (L/X) \u2208 H 2 (X, Q), to be defined in (18).\nLet (X, g) be a Riemannian manifold and L \u2192 X a circle bundle over X with a\nconnection. At each point of L the connection decomposes the tangent space into\na vertical and a horizontal piece. By choosing the standard metric on the circle\nfibers, we can lift the metric g to a metric gL on L. With suitable care, this also\nworks for Seifert bundles f : L \u2192 (X, \u2206).\nTheorem 1. [Kob63, BG00, BGN03a] Let (X, \u2206) be a compact, complex orbifold\nand f : L \u2192 (X, \u2206) a Seifert bundle. Assume that c1 (L/X) is a positive rational\nmultiple of corb\n1 (X, \u2206).\nThen, a positive Ricci curvature orbifold K\u00e4hler metric (resp. K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein\nmetric) on (X, \u2206) can be lifted to a positive Ricci curvature metric (resp. Einstein\nmetric) on L.\nMoreover, the lifted metric is also Sasakian.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJ\u00c1NOS KOLL\u00c1R\n\nIt should be noted that a negative Ricci curvature K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metric on\n(X, \u2206) does not lift to a negative Ricci curvature Einstein metric on L in any\nnatural way.\nThere are only a handful of cases when L \u2192 X is a circle bundle and the above\ntheorem applies, but Boyer and Galicki [BG00, BG01] observed that many more\ncases appear when X is allowed to be an orbifold.\nThe method of Boyer and Galicki starts with a complex hypersurface 0 \u2208 Y \u2282\nCn with an isolated singularity at the origin which is invariant under a C\u2217 -action\n(z1 , . . . , zn ) 7\u2192 (\u03bbw1 z1 , . . . , \u03bbwn zn ). The intersection of Y with the unit sphere\nL := Y \u2229 S 2n\u22121 (1) is called the link of 0 \u2208 Y . L is a (2n \u2212 3)-dimensional real\nmanifold with an S 1 -action. The quotient X := L/S 1 \u223c\n= (Y \\ {0})/C\u2217 is naturally\na complex orbifold.\nMethods of complex singularity theory allow one to identify L as a manifold,\nand this leads to a large class of new Einstein metrics on various spaces, including\nspheres and exotic spheres [BGK04].\nThe aim of this paper is to further generalize this construction to arbitrary Seifert\nbundles. The key advantage of this approach is that we can start with an orbifold\n(X, \u2206) and construct Seifert bundles over (X, \u2206) later. This provides substantially\ngreater flexibility, allowing one to explore the natural scope of the theory. The\nconstruction of higher dimensional Seifert bundles was considered in [OW75] for X\nsmooth; the general case is treated in [Kol04b]. The integral cohomology of Seifert\nbundles is rather subtle in general, but the 5\u2013dimensional case is quite manageable.\nThe natural questions to be considered can be grouped around four problems:\nProblems 2.\n(1) Describe all manifolds L which have a Seifert bundle sutructure f : L \u2192\n(X, \u2206) over an orbifold with positive orbifold Chern class corb\n1 (X, \u2206).\n(2) Given a manifold L, describe all Seifert bundle sutructures f : L \u2192 (X, \u2206)\nover an orbifold with corb\n1 (X, \u2206) > 0.\n(3) Construct positive Ricci curvature orbifold K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metrics on orbifolds (X, \u2206).\n(4) Study the place of the resulting Einstein metrics in the theory of Einstein\nmanifolds.\nIt seems rather artificial to separate the first two problems, but they are quite\ndifferent in nature. I believe that in dimension five Problem (1) is doable with the\npresent methods, whereas Problem (2) seems hopeless to me. The reason for this\nis connected with the complex geometry of the quotients X = L/S 1 . These are Del\nPezzo surfaces with quotient singularities, also called log Del Pezzo surfaces. While\nsmooth Del Pezzo surfaces have been classified and understood for more than a\ncentury, log Del Pezzo surfaces occur in bewildering abundance and complexity;\nsee, for instance, [Miy01, KM99, Sho00].\nNonetheless, as we see, Seifert bundles over log Del Pezzo surfaces tend to have\nsimple topology. Thus many cases are excluded, and for some of the extreme cases\none can get a complete description. Having a Seifert bundle with simple topology\nimposes only mild conditions on a log Del Pezzo surface, and I do not see how to\nget a good description. In all likelihood, the hardest is to describe all Seifert bundle\nstructures on S 5 .\nBy Myers' theorem, the fundamental group of a compact manifold with positive\nRicci curvature is finite. Therefore we concentrate of those cases when L is simply\n\n\fEINSTEIN METRICS ON 5-DIMENSIONAL SEIFERT BUNDLES\n\n3\n\nconnected. We see in (90) that for every simply connected manifold with such\na Seifert bundle structure, the second Stiefel\u2013Whitney class is zero. These 5\u2013\nmanifolds are well understood topologically:\nTheorem 3. [Sma62] Let L be a simply connected compact 5\u2013manifold with vanishing second Stiefel\u2013Whitney class. Then:\n(1) L is uniquely determined by H2 (L, Z).\n(2) The torsion subgroup of the second homology is of the form tors H2 (L, Z) \u223c\n=\nA + A for some finite Abelian group A.\n(3) For any finite Abelian group A and for any n \u2265 0 there is a (unique) L\nwith H2 (L, Z) \u223c\n= Zk + A + A.\nIf H2 (L, Z) is torsionfree of rank k then L is the connected sum of k copies\nof S 2 \u00d7 S 3 . For any k, Einstein metrics on these were constructed in [BGN02,\nBGN03b, BG03, Kol04a]. By contrast, the first result of this paper shows that very\nfew of the possible torsion subgroups do occur.\nTheorem 4. Let L be a compact 5\u2013manifold such that H1 (L, Z) = 0. Assume that\nL has a Seifert bundle structure f : L \u2192 (S, \u2206) with corb\n1 (S, \u2206) > 0. Then the\ntorsion subgroup of the second homology, tors H2 (L, Z), is one of the following:\n(1) (Z/m)2 for any m,\n(2) (Z/5)4 or (Z/4)4 ,\n(3) (Z/3)4 , (Z/3)6 or (Z/3)8 ,\n(4) (Z/2)2n for any n.\nConversely, all these cases do occur, even for manifolds with Einstein metrics.\nOne can be even more precise if H2 (L, Z) is torsion, that is, when L is a rational\nhomology sphere. The following characterization uses the notion of the orbifold\nfundamental group \u03c01orb (X, \u2206) and its abelianization H1orb (X, \u2206), to be defined in\n(35).\nTheorem 5. There is a one\u2013to\u2013one correspondence between\n(1) Seifert bundle structures f : L \u2192 (S, \u2206) on 5-dimensional, compact rational\nhomology spheres with H1 (L, Z) = 0, and\n(2) compact, complex, 2\u2013dimensional, locally cyclic orbifolds (S, \u2206) with H2 (S, Q) =\nQ and H1orb (S, \u2206) = 0.\nUnder this correspondence, \u03c01 (L) = \u03c01orb (S, \u2206).\nThere are many such orbifolds (S, \u2206) where corb\n1 (S, \u2206) is negative, but very few\nwhen corb\n(S,\n\u2206)\nis\npositive.\nThree\ninfinite\nseries\nwere found in [BG04a], giving\n1\nEinstein metrics on rational homology spheres L with H2 (L, Z) = (Z/m)2 for any\nm not divisible by 6. We give a complete classification of all cases when H2 (L, Z)\ncontains a torsion element of large enough order. Besides the above 3 series, there is\nonly one more infinite series, but dozens, probably hundreds, of sporadic examples.\nTheorem 6. Let L be a 5-dimensional compact rational homology sphere which\nhas a Seifert bundle structure f : L \u2192 (S, \u2206) with corb\n1 (S, \u2206) > 0. Assume that\nH1 (L, Z) = 0 and H2 (L, Z) contains a torsion element of order at least 12. Then:\n(1) H2 (L, Z) = (Z/m)2 for some m not divisible by 30,\n(2) L is simply connected,\n(3) the number of Seifert bundle structures varies between 1 and 4, depending\non m mod 30,\n\n\f4\n\nJ\u00c1NOS KOLL\u00c1R\n\n(4) each Seifert bundle structure gives rise to a 2\u2013parameter family of Einstein\nmetrics, naturally parametrized by the moduli space of genus 1 curves.\n(See (84) for a detailed description of the orbifolds (S, \u2206).)\nRemark 7. There are further examples with H2 (L, Z) = (Z/m)2 for every m \u2264 11,\nsee (57, 58).\nThe rank of H2 (L, Z) and its torsion subgroup are not independent of each other,\nbut I have only fragmentary results describing their interaction.\nTheorem 8. Let L be a 5-dimensional compact manifold which has a Seifert bundle\nstructure f : L \u2192 (S, \u2206) with corb\n1 (S, \u2206) > 0. Assume that H1 (L, Z) = 0 and write\nH2 (L, Z) = Zn + A + A.\n(1) If H2 (L, Z) = Zn + (Z/m)2 for some m \u2265 12 then\n(a) L is simply connected and n \u2264 8,\n(b) there are 93 such cases for every m \u2265 12, (see (70) for the complete\nlist)\n(c) each Seifert bundle structure yields an at least 2\u2013parameter family of\nEinstein metrics.\n(2) If H2 (L, Z) = Zn + (Z/5)4 then\n(a) L is a simply connected rational homology sphere,\n(b) L and the Seifert bundle structure are unique, and\n(c) L admits a 4\u2013dimensional family of Einstein metrics, naturally parametrized\nby the moduli space of genus 2 curves.\n9 (K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metrics). In Section 7 we construct positive Ricci curvature\nK\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metrics on certain 2\u2013dimensinal orbifolds. While these examples\nare mostly new, the method is the same as in [JK01], relying on earlier works of\n[Nad90, DK01]. Thus nothing essentially new is added to Problem (3).\n10 (Sasakian manifolds). While I prefer to think of Seifert bundles as a topological\nobject L associated to an algebro\u2013geometric object (X, \u2206), they have a natural\nplace within the framework of Sasakian geometry. (See [BG04b] for a recent survey\npaper.)\nRoughly speaking, a quasi\u2013regular Sasakian manifold is a Seifert bundle L over\na K\u00e4hler orbifold (X, \u2206) plus a metric on L which optimally matches the orbifold\nK\u00e4hler metric on (X, \u2206).\nIn the language of Sasakian geometry, the main results of this paper are the\nfollowing:\n(1) Corollary (81) gives topological restrictions for a 5\u2013dimensional rational\nhomology sphere to admit a quasi\u2013regular Sasakian structure.\n(2) Theorem (4) shows that most 5\u2013manifolds do not admit a positive quasi\u2013\nregular Sasakian structure.\n(3) Theorems (6) and (8) classify all positive quasi\u2013regular Sasakian structures\non certain 5\u2013manifolds.\n(4) We also get new examples of quasi\u2013regular Sasakian\u2013Einstein metrics, though\nthe examples discovered by Boyer and Galicki already cover almost all cases\nallowed by Theorems (4) and (6).\n11 (Description of the sections). Basic results on Seifert bundles and on the Kobayashi\nconstruction are recalled in Section 1. In the most general case, we are led to study\n\n\fEINSTEIN METRICS ON 5-DIMENSIONAL SEIFERT BUNDLES\n\n5\n\nSeifert bundles over orbifolds which locally look like the quotient of Cn by a cyclic\ngroup. These are studied in Section 2.\nOur main aim is to understand 5\u2013dimensional Seifert bundles where the base is a\nlog Del Pezzo surface (53). These are rational surfaces with quotient singularities.\nIn Section 3 we see how to compute the topological (co)homology of these surfaces\nin terms of their algebraic geometry. A key point is to compute everything with\nZ-coefficient.\nThe cohomology groups of a Seifert bundle f : L \u2192 S are computed by a Leray\nspectral sequence, and we study it in Section 4. The spectral sequence degenerates\nat E3 and we get a pretty complete description of the E2 -term. The differential\nE20,1 \u2192 E22,0 is identified with a first Chern class. A key observation is that torsion\nin H2 (L, Z) comes from curves C \u2282 S of genus at least 1 such that every fiber of f\nabove C is multiple.\nLog Del Pezzo surfaces have been the objects of intense investigation (see [Miy01,\nKM99, Sho00]). While smooth Del Pezzo surfaces form a well understood and easy\nto describe class, log Del Pezzo surfaces are rather numerous. Nonetheless, it is\nquite rare that a Seifert bundle can have multiple fibers over a curve of genus at\nleast 1, and many of these are classified in Section 5.\nDel Pezzo surfaces with cyclic Du Val singularities and simply connected smooth\npart are listed in Section 6.\nSection 7 establishes the existence of K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metrics on most of the\nsurfaces considered previously.\nA characterization of Seifert bundle structures on rational homology spheres is\ngiven in Section 8 in terms of algebraic geometry. There are probably too many\ncases for a meaningful classification. Here we also collect the details to get proofs\nof the main theorems.\nThere is a close relationship between manifolds with Seifert bundles and links of\n3\u2013dimensional log terminal singularities. Some of the resulting open questions are\nmentioned in Section 9.\nAcknowledgments . I thank Ch. Boyer, K. Galicki and J. McKernan for many\nuseful conversations and e-mails.

Einstein metrics on Seifert bundles\nLet (X, g) be a Riemannian manifold and L \u2192 X a circle bundle over X with\na connection D. At each point of L the connection decomposes the tangent space\ninto a vertical and a horizontal piece. By choosing the standard metric on the circle\nfibers, we can lift the metric g to a metric gD on L. Kobayashi [Kob63] asked: If\n(X, g) is an Einstein manifold, when is (L, gD ) Einstein?\nIt turns out that this happens only rarely.\nTheorem 12. [Kob63] Notation and assumptions as above. Then (L, gD ) is an\nEinstein manifold iff and only if one of the following two conditions are satisfied:\n(1) (X, g) is Ricci flat and D is flat.\n(2) X is a complex manifold, g is the real part of a K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metric \u03c9,\nRicci(\u03c9) > 0 and the curvature of D is a positive multiple of Ricci(\u03c9).\nThe first case is essentially trivial, and here we are interested in the second case.\n\n\f6\n\nJ\u00c1NOS KOLL\u00c1R\n\nIn any given dimension, there are only finitely many deformation types of compact complex manifolds with positive Ricci curvature (cf. [Nad91, Cam91, KMM92]),\nso (12.2) gives only a handful of new Einstein manifolds.\nIf X is a compact complex manifold with positive Ricci curvature then H i (X, OX ) =\n0 for every i > 0, in particular, every topological circle bundle over X can be written\nuniquely as the unit circle bundle of a holomorphic C\u2217 -bundle f : Y \u2192 X. Thus\nthe second alternative of (12) can be formulated completely in terms of complex\ngeometry. This is the setting where one can generalize the Kobayashi construction.\nDefinition 13. Let X be a normal complex space. A Seifert C\u2217 -bundle over X is\na normal complex space Y together with a morphism f : Y \u2192 X and a C\u2217 -action\non Y satisfying the following two conditions.\n(1) f is Stein (that is, the preimage of any open Stein subset of X is Stein)\nand C\u2217 -equivariant (with respect to the trivial action on X).\n(2) For every x \u2208 X, the C\u2217 -action on the reduced fiber Yx := red f \u22121 (x),\nC\u2217 \u00d7 Yx \u2192 Yx is C\u2217 -equivariantly biholomorphic to the natural C\u2217 -action\non C\u2217 /\u03bcm for some m = m(x, Y /X), where \u03bcm \u2282 C\u2217 denotes the group of\nmth roots of unity.\nThe number m(x, Y /X) is called the multiplicity of the Seifert fiber over x.\nOne can always assume that the C\u2217 -action is effective, that is, m(x, Y /X) = 1\nfor general x \u2208 X.\nNote that even if Y is smooth, X can have quotient singularities.\nA classification of Seifert C\u2217 -bundles for X a smooth manifold with H1 (X, Z)\ntorsion free is given in [OW75]. Many other cases are described in [Dol75, Pin77,\nDem88, FZ03]. The general case is discussed in detail in [Kol04b]. We recall the\nrelevant facts below.\n14 (Description of Seifert C\u2217 -bundles). Let f : Y \u2192 X be a Seifert C\u2217 -bundle.\nThe set of points {x \u2208 X : m(x, Y /X) > 1} is a closed analytic subset of X. It\ncan be written as the union of Weil divisors \u222aDi and of a subset of codimension at\nleast 2 contained in Sing X. The latter will not be relevant to us. The multiplicity\nm(x, Y /X) is constant on a dense open subset of each Di , this common value is\ncalled the multiplicity of the P\nSeifert C\u2217 -bundle over Di ; denote it by mi := m(Di ).\nWe call the Q-divisor \u2206 := (1 \u2212 m1i )Di the branch divisor of f : Y \u2192 X. We\nfrequently write f : Y \u2192 (X, \u2206) to indicate the branch divisor.\nTheorem 15. [Kol04b,\nP Thm.7] Let X be a normal complex space with quotient\nsingularities and \u2206 := (1 \u2212 m1i )Di a Q-divisor. There is a one\u2013to\u2013one correspondence between Seifert C\u2217 -bundles f : Y \u2192 (X, \u2206) and the following data:\n(1) For each Di an integer 0 \u2264 bi < mi , relatively prime to mi , and\n(2) a linear equivalence class of Weil divisors B \u2208 Weil(X). (In all the cases\nthat we consider in this paper, Weil(X) \u223c\n= H2 (X, Z).)\n16 (Algebraic construction).

Dealing with torsion in H 2 (X, Z) is, however,\ndelicate, and [OW75] assumes that there is no torsion.)\nIf X is singular, then one first proves that f : Y \u2192 (X, \u2206) is uniquely determined\nby its restriction to the smooth locus of X and then the previous method applies.\nDefinition 18.

An orbifold is a normal, compact, complex space X\nlocally given by charts written as quotients of smooth coordinate charts. That is, X\ncan be covered by open charts X = \u222aUi and for each Ui there is a smooth complex\nspace Vi and a finite group Gi acting on Vi such that Ui is biholomorphic to the\nquotient space Vi /Gi . The quotient maps are denoted by \u03c6i : Vi \u2192 Ui .\nThe compatibility condition between the charts that one needs to assume is that\nthere are global divisors Dj \u2282 X and ramification indices mj such that Dij =\nUi \u2229 Dj and mij = mj (after suitable re-indexing).\nIt is convenient to codifyP\nthese data by a single Q-divisor, called the branch\ndivisor of the orbifold, \u2206 := (1 \u2212 m1j )Dj .\nP\nThe orbifold canonical class is KX + (1 \u2212 m1i )Di .

Let f : Y \u2192 (X, \u2206) be a Seifert C\u2217 -bundle with Y smooth. For\nx \u2208 X pick any y \u2208 f \u22121 (x) and a \u03bcm -invariant smooth hypersurface Vx \u2282 Y\ntransversal to red f \u22121 (x) for m = m(x, Y /X). Then {\u03c6x : Vx \u2192 Ux := Vx /\u03bcm }\ngives an orbifold structure on X. The orbifold branch divisor coincides with the\nbranch divisor of the Seifert bundle defined in (14).\nNote that the orbifolds coming from a smooth Seifert bundle have the additional\nproperty that each Ux is a quotient by a cyclic group \u03bcm . Such an orbifold is called\nlocally cyclic.\nWe usually identify (X, \u2206) with this orbifold structure.\nDefinition 21 (Metrics on orbifolds). A Hermitian metric h on the orbifold (X, \u2206)\nis a Hermitian metric h on X \\ (Sing X \u222a Supp \u2206) such that for every chart \u03c6i :\nVi \u2192 Ui the pull back \u03c6\u2217i h extends to a Hermitian metric on Vi .

As a real Lie group, C\u2217 =\ncontains a real hypersurface L \u2282 Y with an S 1 -action. We call f : L \u2192 (X, \u2206) a\nSeifert S 1 -bundle or simply a Seifert bundle. (In dimension 3, these are the original\nSeifert bundles.)\nY retracts to L, thus they have isomorphic homology and homotopy groups.\nP\nTheorem 23. [Kob63, BG00] Let f : Y \u2192 (X, \u2206 = (1 \u2212 m1i )Di ) be a Seifert\nC\u2217 -bundle and f : L \u2192 (X, \u2206) the corresponding Seifert S 1 -bundle. Assume that L\n\n\f8\n\nJ\u00c1NOS KOLL\u00c1R\n\nis a manifold. Then L admits an S 1 -invariant Einstein metric with positive Ricci\ncurvature if and only if the following hold.\n(1) The orbifold canonical class KX + \u2206 is anti ample and there is an orbifold\nK\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metric on (X, \u2206).\n(2) The Chern class c1 (Y /X) is a negative multiple of KX + \u2206.\n\u0003\nFrom the point of view of algebraic geometry, the most useful property is the\nfirst part of (23.1). This class of orbifolds have their own name.\nDefinition 24. An orbifold (X, \u2206) is called Fano or log Fano if the orbifold canonical class KX + \u2206 is anti ample.\n2. Smooth Seifert bundles\n25 (Locally cyclic orbifolds). Let f : Y \u2192 (X, \u2206) be a Seifert C\u2217 -bundle, dim X =\nn. Pick a point x \u2208 X and assume that Y is smooth along f \u22121 (x). As we\nsaw in (20), (X, \u2206) is then a locally cyclic orbifold near x. By diagonalizing the\ncyclic group action, we see that locally x \u2208 X is biholomorphic to Dn /\u03bcm for\nm = m(x, Y /X) where Dn \u2282 Cn is the n-dimensional polydisc and the irreducible\ncomponents of \u2206 passing through x are the quotients of (some of) the coordinate\nhyperplanes in Dn .\nA straightforward explicit computation (cf. [Kol04b, 22\u201325]) shows that m =\nr * m1 * * * mn where\n(1) The m1 , . . . , mn are the multiplicities of the irreducible components of \u2206\npassing through x. (We add the necessary number of 1-s if there are fewer\nthan n such components.)\n(2) The m1 , . . . , mn are pairwise relatively prime.\n(3) The quotient D\u0304n := Dn /\u03bcm1 ***mn is smooth, Dn /\u03bcm \u223c\n= D\u0304n /\u03bcr and the\n\u03bcr -action is fixed point free outside a codimension 2 subset.\n(4) Thus Z/r is the local fundamental group of X\\Sing X at x, hence m(x, Y /X)\ndepends only on (X, \u2206) and not on Y .\nDefinition 26. Let (X, \u2206) be an orbifold given by the charts \u03c6i : Vi \u2192 Ui . A\ndivisor D \u2282 X is called orbismooth if the set theoretic preimages \u03c6\u22121\ni (D) \u2282 Vi are\nall smooth.\nThus D itself is an orbifold with the induced orbifold structure.\nIf dim X = 2 then D is a curve and orbismooth implies smooth. However, not\nall smooth curves in X are orbismooth.\nFor instance, act on C2 by \u03bc5 as (x, y) 7\u2192 (\u01eb2 x, \u01eb3 y). Then (x3 \u2212 y 2 = 0)/\u03bc5 \u2282\nC2 /\u03bc5 is smooth but not orbismooth.\nP\nDefinition 27. Let (X, \u2206 =\n(1 \u2212 m1i )Di ) be a locally cyclic orbifold. Such\nan orbifold behaves very much like a manifold if we use Q-coefficients, but torsion\nquestions become quite delicate when working with integral (co)homology. We need\nseveral ways to measure contributions of the orbifold points.\nAs above, for every x \u2208 X we can write the orbifold structure of (X, \u2206) in a\nsuitable neighborhood as Dn /\u03bcm(x) and the orbifold structure of (X, \u2205) as D\u0304n /\u03bcr(x) .\n(1) Set M (x, \u2206) := lcm(mi : x \u2208 Di ) and M (\u2206) := lcm(m(x, \u2206) : x \u2208 X) =\nlcm(mi ).\n(2) Set M (x, X) = r(x) and M (X) := lcm(M (x, X)) : x \u2208 X)\n\n\fEINSTEIN METRICS ON 5-DIMENSIONAL SEIFERT BUNDLES\n\n9\n\n(3) Set M (x, X, \u2206) = m(x) and M (X, \u2206) := lcm(M (x, X, \u2206) : x \u2208 X) =\nlcm(m(x) : x \u2208 X).\nAs noted in (25), M (x, X, \u2206) = M (x, \u2206) * M (x, X) and M (X, \u2206)|M (\u2206) * M (X)\nbut the latter can be different.\nDefinition 28. Let \u03bcr act on Dn such that the action is fixed point free outside\na codimension 2 subset. Then Weil(Dn /\u03bcr ) \u223c\n= Z/r, noncanonically (cf. [Kol04b,\n24]). This is called the local class group of X at x, denoted by Weil(x, X). One\ncan also identify this group as the second cohomology of the smooth part of the\nquotient Dn /\u03bcr . Thus if X is an orbifold, for every singular point of X we obtain\na map Rx : Weil(X) \u2192 Weil(x, X) which is nonzero on a Weil divisor A iff A is not\nCartier at x. Thus\nPic(X) = \u2229x\u2208X ker Rx \u2282 Weil(X).\nTopologically, we can see this as\nH 2 (X, Z) = \u2229x ker[H2n\u22122 (X, Z) \u2192 Weil(x, X)],\nwhere we identify H 2 (X, Z) with its image in H2n\u22122 (X, Z) by capping with the\nfundamental class.\nIn particular, we can view multiplication by M (X) as a map\nM (X) : Weil(X) \u2192 Pic(X) or M (X) : H2n\u22122 (X, Z) \u2192 H 2 (X, Z).\nDefinition 29.

The topology of singular surfaces\nLet L \u2192 (S, \u2206) be a Seifert bundle over a compact complex surface. As we saw in\n(23), the Kobayashi construction yields an Einstein metric on L only if \u2212(KS + \u2206)\nis ample. In particular, S is always a projective algebraic surface. If L is smooth\nthen S has only quotient singularities by (20). Such surface is always rational (this\nis an easy special case of [Sak84] or of [MM86]).\nIn practice, one can understand the algebraic curves and their intersection theory\non any (singular) rational surface. The aim of this section is to describe their\ntopology, especially various (co)homology groups, in terms of algebraic curves.\n\n\f10\n\nJ\u00c1NOS KOLL\u00c1R\n\nLet S be a normal compact surface.

The cokernel is torsion free since H 2 (S, OS ) is torsion free.\nSet A := Sing S and A\u2032 := f \u22121 (A). The homology sequences of the pairs (S \u2032 , A\u2032 )\nand (S, A) give a commutative diagram\nH2 (A\u2032 , Z) \u2192 H2 (S \u2032 , Z) \u2192 H2 (S \u2032 , A\u2032 , Z)\n\u21930\n\u2193 f\u2217\n\u2193\u223c\n=\nH2 (A, Z) \u2192 H2 (S, Z) \u2192 H2 (S, A, Z)\n\n\u2192 H1 (A\u2032 , Z)\n\u21930\n\u2192 H1 (A, Z)\n\nThe horizontal maps at the end are 0 since dim A = 0. H1 (A\u2032 , Z) = 0 since the resolution graph of a rational surface singularity is a tree of rational curves. This implies\nthat H2 (S, Z) \u223c\n= H2 (S \u2032 , Z)/H2 (A\u2032 , Z).

In general the natural map H 2 (S, Z)/ Pic(S) \u2192 H 2 (S \u2032 , Z)/ Pic(S \u2032 )\nis not an isomorphism. As an example, let S \u2032 \u2282 P3 be a general quartic surface\ncontaining a plane conic C. C \u2282 S \u2032 is a \u22122-curve and we contract it to get S. Then\nH 2 (S, Z) = ker[H 2 (S \u2032 , Z) \u2192 H 2 (C, Z) \u223c\n= Z] and Pic(S) = ker[Pic(S \u2032 ) \u2192 Pic(C) \u223c\n=\nZ]. The first of these is surjective while the image of the second is 2Z.\nProposition 40. Let S be a normal compact surface with rational singularities.\n(1) If H 1 (S, Q) = 0 then H 1 (S, OS ) = 0.\n(2) If, in addition, H 2 (S, Q) \u223c\n= Q then H 2 (S, OS ) = 0.\nProof. Let f : S \u2032 \u2192 S be a resolution, then R1 f\u2217 Z = 0 and R1 f\u2217 OS \u2032 = 0 since S\nhas rational singularities. If H 1 (S, Q) = 0, the first implies that H 1 (S \u2032 , Q) = 0 and\nso H 1 (S \u2032 , OS ) = 0 by Hodge theory (cf. [GH78, Sec.0.7]). This gives H 1 (S, OS ) = 0.\nIf H2 (S, Q) \u223c\n= Q then it is generated by algebraic cycles. By (38) this implies\nthat H2 (S \u2032 , Q) \u223c\n= Q is generated by algebraic cycles, hence H 2 (S \u2032 , OS \u2032 ) = 0 which\n2\ngives that H (S, OS ) = 0.\n\u0003\n\n\fEINSTEIN METRICS ON 5-DIMENSIONAL SEIFERT BUNDLES\n\n13\n\n41 (Surfaces with H 1 (F, OF ) = H 2 (F, OF ) = 0). By classification theory, smooth\nprojective surfaces with H 1 (F, OF ) = H 2 (F, OF ) = 0 fall in three groups. (See, for\ninstance, [BHPVdV04, Chap.VI] for a comprehensive treament.)\n(1) F is a rational surface,\n(2) F is an Enriques surface [BHPVdV04, VIII.15\u201321], or\n(3) F is of general type with q = pg = 0 [BHPVdV04, VII.10].\nWe are specially interested in cases when F is obtained as a resolution of a\nsurface S with rational singularities and H 2 (S, Q) \u223c\n= Q. There are many such\nexamples where F is rational but probably very few examples where F is Enriques\nor of general type.\nA nice class of examples is given by the so called fake projective planes, smooth\nsurfaces F with H 1 (F, Z) = 0 and H 2 (F, Z) \u223c\n= Z (cf.

All of these are quotients of the complex unit ball (this is a\nrather difficult result of [Yau77]) hence have a large fundamental group.\nMost surfaces with q = pg = 0 are not simply connected (cf.

The only known simply connected examples have large Picard number.\nWith no basis whatsoever, other than the lack of such examples, I suggest that\nthis may be a general phenomenon.

The adjunction formula (with a little extra work for\nthe singularities) says that\ndeg KD0 \u2264 D0 * (KS + D0 ) \u2264 D0 * (\u2212\n\nn\nX\n\nai Di ) \u2264 0.\n\ni=1\n\nThus D0 is elliptic and we also get that \u2206 = D0 .\nThe ascending chain condition principle predicts that all this should also work if\na0 is close to 1, and [Kol94, sec.5] implies this for a0 \u2265 41/42. This is quite surprising at first sight since we work with singular surfaces, and the various intersection\nnumbers are only rational numbers.\nHere we are in a rather special situation, and we get better bounds with careful\ncase analysis.\nDefinition 53. A log Del Pezzo surface is a pair (S, \u2206) where\n\n\fEINSTEIN METRICS ON 5-DIMENSIONAL SEIFERT BUNDLES\n\n17\n\n(1) S is a P\nnormal, projective surface,\n(2) \u2206 :=\nai Di is a linear combination of distinct irreducible divisors with\n0 \u2264 ai \u2264 1, and\n(3) \u2212(KS + \u2206) is ample. (That is, a suitable multiple of it is an ample Cartier\ndivisor.)\nThus a 2\u2013dimensional log Fano orbifold is a log Del Pezzo surface.\nThe Q-divisor\nP \u2206 is called the boundary. In the orbifold case the boundary is of\nthe form \u2206 = (1 \u2212 m1i )Di , where the mi are natural numbers. Such a boundary\nis sometimes called standard.\nIdeally one would like to have a classification of all log Del Pezzo surfaces, but\nthis seems quite out of reach. Some kind of rough structure theorems are given in\n[KM99, Sho00].\nPn\nProposition 54. Let (S, \u2206 = i=0 ai Di ) be a log Del Pezzo surface. Assume that\nD0 has geometric genus \u2265 1 and a0 \u2265 1/2. Then Di is rational for i \u2265 1 and\n(1) g(D0 ) = 1 if a0 \u2265 5/6,\n(2) g(D0 ) \u2264 2 if a0 \u2265 3/4,\n(3) g(D0 ) \u2264 4 if a0 \u2265 2/3.\nThe proof of this is an easy application of the minimal model program for rational\nsurfaces. In general, it is difficult to run the minimal model program backwards,\nand it seems complicated to get a full classification, except when a0 is close to one.\nProposition 55. Notation and assumptions as in (54). Assume in addition that\na0 \u2265 11/12 and ai \u2265 1/2 for every i. Then S is a Del Pezzo surface with Du Val\nsingularities and \u2206 = a0 D0 . The Picard number of S is at most 8.\nDel Pezzo surfaces of Picard number 1 and with Du Val singularities are classified\nin [Fur86]. Adding P2 and the quadric cone, one gets 29 types. (Some types\ncorrespond to more than 1 surface, I do not know how many there are up to\nisomorphism.) By the results of [MZ88], or by checking the conditions of (43), we\nobtain the following.\n1\n)D) be a log Del Pezzo surface of Picard number\nProposition 56. Let (S, (1 \u2212 m\n1, with m \u2265 12 and g(D) \u2265 1. If H1 (S 0 , Z) = 0 then S is one of the following:\n(1) P2 . Here Pic(S) = Weil(S) and it is generated by the class of a line.\n(2) Q, the quadric cone. Here Pic(S) = 2 * Weil(S), the latter generated by the\nlines through the vertex of the cone.\n(3) P2 (1, 2, 3), the weighted projective plane with weights 1, 2, 3. Here Pic(S) =\n6 * Weil(S), the latter generated by the line (x = 0) where x is the weight 1\ncoordinate.\n(4) S5 , a degree 5 Del Pezzo surface with a single point of index 5. This is\nobtained by blowing up a flex of a smooth cubic 4 times and then contracting\nthe tangent line and the first 3 exceptional curves. If G is the equation of\nthe cubic and L the equation of the flex tangent then G/L3 lifts to a rational\nfunction on S5 which has a 5 fold pole along the unique line of the surface\nwhich pases through the singular point. The line generates Weil(S5 ) and\nPic(S5 ) = 5 * Weil(S5 ).\nIn all of these cases, D is a smooth member of \u2212KS and it has genus 1.\n\u0003\n\nThe following two examples show that for m \u2264 11 there are other cases as well.\n\n\f18\n\nJ\u00c1NOS KOLL\u00c1R\n\n10\n(x6 +y 3 +z 2 = 0).\nExample 57.

Let S be a degree 1 Del Pezzo surface where | \u2212 KS | has a member\nD1 of type II \u2217 (also denoted by \u1ebc8 ) on Kodaira's list (cf. [BHPVdV04, V.7]). This\nhas a unique point P of multiplicity 11. Blow it up S \u2032 \u2192 S and contract the\nbirational transform D1\u2032 of D1 to get S \u2032 \u2192 S \u2217 , a log Del Pezzo surface with Picard\nnumber 1.\nLet D0 be a smooth elliptic member of | \u2212 KS | and D0\u2217 its birational transform\non S \u2217 .

Let g : S \u2032 \u2192 S be the minimal resolution of S. KS \u2032 \u2261\ng \u2217 KS \u2212(effective divisor), thus \u2212KS \u2032 \u2261 a0 D0\u2032 +(big effective divisor) where D0\u2032 \u2282 S \u2032\nis the birational transform of D0 . Since S \u2032 is rational, there is a morphism h : S \u2032 \u2192\nS m where S m is either P2 or a minimal ruled surface. Only rational curves are\ncontracted by h, so \u2212KS m \u2261 a0 D0m + (big effective divisor) where D0m = h(D0\u2032 ).\nIf S m \u223c\n= P2 and deg D0m \u2265 4, then 4a0 \u2264 a0 deg D0m < 3 implies that a0 < 3/4.\nThus if a0 \u2265 3/4 then D0m \u2282 P2 is a smooth degree 3 curve.\nSimilarly, if S m = P1 \u00d7 P1 , the smooth quadric, we get that D0m is a smooth\nelliptic curve cut out by another quadric if a0 \u2265 2/3.\nThe remaining possibility is that S m \u223c\n= Fn , the minimal ruled surface with a\nsection E of selfintersection \u2212n and n \u2265 2. Let F denote a fiber of the projection\nto P1 . Then \u2212KFn = 2E + (n + 2)F . If |aE + bF | has a nonrational member then\na \u2265 2 and b \u2265 na and so in our case\n2E + (n + 2)F \u2212 a0 (2E + 2nF ) = (2 \u2212 2a0 )E + (n + 2 \u2212 2na0 )F\nis effective and big. Thus n + 2 > 2na0 and for a0 \u2265 2/3 this gives n \u2264 5. We also\nget that a0 \u2264 5/6 for n \u2265 3.\nIf a \u2265 3 then the coefficient of E is \u2264 2 \u2212 3a0 , thus again a0 < 2/3. Hence we\nneed to enumerate all cases when n = 2, 3, 4, 5 and C \u2208 |2E + (2n + c)F | for some\nc \u2265 0. As before, we get that (2 \u2212 2a0 )E + (n + 2 \u2212 (2n + c)a0 )F is effective and\nbig which implies that a0 < (n + 2)/(2n + c).\nIf n = 2 and c = 0 then D0 is elliptic. In all other cases we get that a0 < 5/6\nand a0 \u2265 4/5 only if n = 3, c = 0. Furthermore, a0 \u2265 3/4 in one additional case\nonly, when n = 2, c = 1.\n\u0003\nExample 60. Let Fn \u2282 Pn+1 be the cone over the rational normal curve of degree\nn in Pn . It can be also realized as Fn = P(1, 1, n). Weil(Fn ) is generated by the\nlines L. KFn \u223c \u2212(n + 2)L and Pic(Fn ) is generated by the hyperplane class which\nis nL.\nLet C \u2282 Fn be a smooth intersection of Fn with a quadric.

On P(1, 2, 5) consider a general member C \u2208 |O(10))|. C is smooth,\nhas genus 2 and the pair (P(1, 2, 5), 43 C) is log Del Pezzo.\nP\n1\n)D0 + ai Di ) be a log Del Pezzo surface. Assume\nProposition 62. Let (S, (1 \u2212 m\nthat g(D0 ) \u2265 2, m \u2265 5 and ai \u2265 21 . Then S \u2282 P4 is the cone over the rational\ncubic and D0 is the intersection of S with a quadric.\nThere is a unique such pair (S, (1 \u2212 15 )D0 ) for every genus 2 curve D0 .\nProof. From the case analysis in (59) we see that the minimal resolution of S\ndominates F3 and does not dominate any other minimal rational surface. Any one\npoint blow up of F3 dominates either F2 or F4 , thus the minimal resolution of S is\nF3 .\nThe first possibility is that S is the cone over the rational cubic and then D is\nthe intersection of S with a quadric by the cases analysis.\nThe second possibility is that S = F3 . Using the notation of (59) we get that\n1\n(1 \u2212 m\n)D \u2264 \u2212KS = 2E + 5F . Since m \u2265 5, this implies that D \u2264 2E + 6F .\nThe condition g(D) \u2265 2 implies that in fact D = 2E + 6F . Then \u2212(KS + (1 \u2212\n2\n1\n1\nm )D) \u2264 5 E + 5 F and there is no room for any other boundary curves. Finally\n1\n\u2212(KS + (1 \u2212 5 )D) has negative intersection number with E, a contradiction.\nLet D be any genus 2 curve and f : D \u2192 P1 the canonical map. Then\nf\u2217 OD = OP1 + OP1 (\u22123). This provides the unique embedding of D into F3 , the\nprojectivization of OP1 + OP1 (\u22123).\n\u0003\n63 (Proof of (55)). As we noted during the proof of (54), a0 \u2265 5/6 implies that\nS m = P2 , P1 \u00d7 P1 or F2 .\nS \u2032 is obtained from S m by repeatedly blowing up points S \u2032 = Sn \u2192 Sn\u22121 \u2192\n* * * \u2192 S m.\nLet us look at the first blow up h : Sj \u2192 Sj\u22121 where we blow up a point p not\non the birational transform of D0 . Let E \u2282 Sj denote the exceptional curve of the\nblow up. On Sj we can write\n\u2212KSj \u2261 a0 D0j + \u03b1E + \u2206\u2217j ,\nwhere \u03b1 \u2265 0, \u2206\u2217j is effective and its support does not contain E. By our assumption,\nE is disjoint from D0j . This implies that\n(E * \u2206\u2217j ) \u2265 \u2212(KS * E) \u2212 \u03b1(E * E) = 1 + \u03b1 \u2265 1,\nwhich in turn gives that\n\u2212KSj\u22121 \u2261 a0 D0j\u22121 + h\u2217 (\u2206\u2217j )\n\nand\n\nmultp h\u2217 (\u2206\u2217j ) \u2265 1.\n\n1/(1 \u2212 a0 )h\u2217 (\u2206\u2217j ) is numerically equivalent to \u2212KSj\u22121 and it has multiplicity at\nleast 1/(1 \u2212 a0 ) \u2265 12 at p. This is impossible by (64).\nThus as we go from S m to S \u2032 , we can blow up at most 8 points on P2 (or at most\n7 points on P1 \u00d7 P1 or F2 ) and all the blow ups occur on the birational transform of\nD0 . Hence S is a Del Pezzo surface with Du Val singularities and its Picard nunber\nis at most 9.\nFinally, if we had any other curve Di in \u2206, then Di would occur with coefficient\nat least 1/2 in (1\u2212\u01eb\u2212a0 )KS , so we would obtain a curve with coefficient bigger than\n\n\f20\n\nJ\u00c1NOS KOLL\u00c1R\n\n6 in an effective divisor numerically equaivalent to \u2212KS . This is again impossible\nby (64).\n\u0003\nLemma 64. Let Y be one of the surfaces P2 , P1 \u00d7 P1 or F2 , C \u2282 Y a smooth cubic.\nLet f : Z \u2192 Y be obtained by repeatedly blowing up points of C. Let D \u2282 Z be a\ndivisor numerically equivalent to \u2212KZ . Then\n(1) multz D \u2264 11 for every point z \u2208 Z.\n(2) multA D \u2264 6 for every curve A \u2282 Z.\nProof. Let Z = Yn \u2192 Yn\u22121 \u2192 * * * \u2192 Yj = Y be the sequence of blow ups where\nwe set Y = Y0 if Y = P2 and Y = Y1 if Y = P1 \u00d7 P1 , F2 .\nThe push forward of D to any of the Yi is again numerically equivalent to \u2212KYi\nand the multiplicity does not change unless z or A is contained in the exceptional set.\nThus by induction on n it is sufficient to consider the case when g : Z \u2192 Z \u2032 := Yn\u22121\nis the blow up of a point p and z or A is contained in the exceptional curve E of g.\nSet D\u2032 := g\u2217 (D), then D = g \u2217 (D\u2032 ) + (multp D\u2032 \u2212 1)E.\nIf n \u2265 10 then (\u2212KZ )2 = 9\u2212n < 0 and so the only divisor numerically equivalent\nto \u2212KZ is C itself which is smooth.\nLet C \u2032 \u2282 Z \u2032 denote the birational transform of C. Then multp D\u2032 \u2264 (C \u2032 * D\u2032 ) =\n9 \u2212 (n \u2212 1), hence if n \u2265 4 then multp D\u2032 \u2264 6 and so multE D \u2264 5 and multz D \u2264 11\nfor every z \u2208 E.\nWe are left with the cases when n \u2264 3, that is, we blow up at most 3 points.\nIn these cases Z is a toric variety. By degenerating D using the torus action and\nnoting that multiplicty is upper semi continuous in degenerations, we are reduced\nto the case when D is fixed by the torus. These cases are easy to enumerate by\nhand.\n\u0003\n6. Log Del Pezzo surfaces with H1orb (S) = 0\nThe aim of this section is to classify Del Pezzo surfaces with cyclic Du Val\nsingularities satisfying H1orb (S) = 0.\nThere are two ways to proceed.\n65 (Traditional approach). The minimal resolution of a Del Pezzo surface S with\nDu Val singularities is obtained from P2 and a smooth cubic curve C \u2282 P2 by\nblowing up m \u2264 8 points on the cubic.\nIn the smooth case, the m points are different and we get only one family for each\nm. In the singular case, the deformation type of the resulting surface is determined\nby the following data:\n(1) Any number of the m points may coincide, and we have to mark all coinciding point pairs.\n(2) We have to mark triplets of points that are on a line. (Keep in mind that if\n3 points coincide, they are also on a line if this point is an inflection point\nof the cubic.)\n(3) We have to mark sextuplets of points that are on a conic. (Again, this can\nhappen with 6 points coinciding at a 6\u2013torsion point.)\nIt is clear that the number of cases is finite, but it would be quite tedious to get a\ncomplete list.\nThe main problem with this approach is that I do not see any efficient way to\ncompute H1orb (S). This seems to be nonzero for the majority of all cases.\n\n\fEINSTEIN METRICS ON 5-DIMENSIONAL SEIFERT BUNDLES\n\n21\n\n66 (Minimal model approach). Here we start with a Del Pezzo surface S with Du\nVal singularities and run the minimal model program to get g : S \u2192 S m . We clasify\nS using the following observations.\n(1) H1orb (S) and \u03c01orb (S) are unchanged during the minimal model program;\nsee (67).\n(2) S m is either P1 \u00d7 P1 or one of the 4 surfaces listed in (56); see (69).\n(3) For a fixed S m , the deformation types of all possible surfaces S \u2192 S m\nare\nP classified by2 sequences of natural numbers m1 \u2264 * * * \u2264 mk such that\nmi < (KS m ) ; see (68).\n(4) Many of the surfaces have representations over different surfaces S m , but\nthese are not too hard to understand; see (70).\n67 (Contractions with Du Val singularities). Let T be any projective surface with\nDu Val singularities and f : T \u2192 U a birational contraction with connected exceptional curve E \u2282 T such that \u2212KT is f -ample. These are easy to classify, see\n[KM99, 3.3]. One gets that u := f (E) \u2208 U is a smooth point and f can be described\nas follows.\nLet u \u2208 C \u2282 U be a smooth curve germ. Fix a number m and blow up u \u2208 C\nrepeatedly m-times. We get m exceptional curves. One of these is a \u22121-curve, the\nother m \u2212 1 form a chain of \u22122-curves. This chain can be contracted to a point of\ntype Am . (It can be described by local equations as xy \u2212 z m+1 = 0 or as a quotient\nof C2 by the Z/(m + 1)-action (x, y) 7\u2192 (\u01ebx, \u01eb\u22121 y).) The resulting surface is T .\nThus we see that E \u2282 T is orbismooth, T has a unique singular point t \u2208 E and\na neighborhood of E minus t is homotopic to a lense space S 3 /(Z/m) with a disc\nattached (corresponding to E \\ {t}), killing the fundamental group. From this, or\nusing [KM99, 3.3] we conclude that H1orb (T ) = H1orb (U ) and \u03c01orb (T ) = \u03c01orb (U ).\nThe deformation type of T is determined by the deformation type of U and the\nnumber m.\nDefinition 68. Let S be a Del Pezzo surface with Du Val singularities and m1 \u2265\n* * * \u2265 mk \u2265 1 integers. We denote by Bm1 ,...,mk S any surface obatined as follows.\nPick any smooth elliptic curve C \u2208 | \u2212 KS | and p1 , . . . , pk distinct points on C.\nThen perform a blow up type mi at pi .\nAll such surfaces form one deformation type. Furthermore, S and the deformation type determine the numbers mi . Indeed, the numbers mi \u2265 2 can be read off\nfrom the singularities and the Picard number determines\nP k.\nThe canonical class of Bm1 ,...,mk S is nef and big iff\nmi < (KS2 ). If this holds\nthen Bm1 ,...,mk S is a Del Pezzo surface for general choice of the points pi .\n69 (The minimal models S m ). If we start with a Del Pezzo surface with (cyclic) Du\nVal singularities S, then all steps of the minimal model program yield Del Pezzo\nsurfaces with (cyclic) Du Val singularities. The program eventually stops, and we\nend up with S \u2192 S m where S m does not have birational contractions. This can\nhappen in two ways\n(1) S m has Picard number 1. If, in addition, H1orb (S) = 0 and S has cyclic Du\nVal singularities then H1orb (S m ) = 0 and by (56) S m is one of the 4 surfaces\nP(1, 2, 3), Q, P2\nm\n\nor S5 .\n\n(2) S has Picard number 2 and it has two different conic bundle sutructures.\nFor S m smooth, this happens only for P1 \u00d7 P1 . A list of the singular cases\n\n\f22\n\nJ\u00c1NOS KOLL\u00c1R\n\nis given in [MZ93]. They are either not simply connected or have noncyclic\nsingularities.\nWe can now state the main classification theorem of the section:\nTheorem 70. There are 93 deformation types of Del Pezzo surfaces with cyclic\nDu Val singularities satisfying H1orb (S) = 0. These are\nP\n(1) Bm1 ,...,mk P(1, 2,P\n3) for\nmi < 6 and mi \u2265 2,\n(2) Bm1 ,...,mk Q for Pmi < 8 and mi \u2265 2,\n(3) Bm1 ,...,mk P2 for\nmiP\n< 9 and mi \u2265 2,\n(4) Bm1 ,...,mk P1 \u00d7 P1 for\nmi < 8,\n(5) S5 , B3 S5 , B4 S5 and B1 P2 .\nAll these satisfy \u03c01orb (S) = 0.\nProof. We know that all of the surfaces are of the form Bm1 ,...,mk S where S is\none of the 5 surfaces listed in (69). First we prove that if mk = 1 and S 6= P1 \u00d7 P1\nthen the resulting surface is somewhere else on the list. This follows from the easy\nisomorphisms:\nB1 P(1, 2, 3) \u223c\n= B4 P 2 .\n= Bm P 1 \u00d7 P 1 , B1 S 5 \u223c\n= B2 P2 , Bm,1 P2 \u223c\n= B3 Q, B1 Q \u223c\nThis implies that every Del Pezzo surface with cyclic Du ValPsingularities satisfying\nH1orb (S) = 0 is either on the list or it is Bm1 ,...,mk S5 for\nmi < 5 and mi \u2265 2.\nThere are only 5 such cases. for two of these, mk = 2. These are eliminated by the\nharder isomorphism\nB2 S 5 \u223c\n= B4 Q.\nThe easiest way to see this is to notice that these blow ups give a cubic surface,\nwhose explicit model is described in [Hen11, Species XIV, p.79]. In his notation,\ncontracting the line x = z = 0 gives Q and contracting the line y = w = 0 gives S5 .\nIt remains to see that all these are different. Amost all cases are decided by\nlooking at the number of singular points minus the Picard number. For the surfaces\nin (70.1) we get 1, for those in (70.2) we get 0, (70.3) gives -1 and (70.4) gives \u2264 \u22122.\nIt remains to observe that the 4 surfaces in (70.5) are nowhere else on the list. \u0003\nRemark 71. The results of [MZ93], coupled with (70) give a complete list of\nall deformation types of Del Pezzo surfaces with arbitrary Du Val singularities\nsatisfying H1orb (S) = 0.\nBy [KM99, 3.10] and [MZ93], there are 5 more such surfaces with Picard number\n1, with singularities D5 , E6 , E7 , E8 , E8 and 3 more with Picard number 2, with\n2 conic bundle structures. These have singularities D4 , D6 , D7 . The blow ups\nconsidered in (68) introduce only cyclic quotient singularities, hence there are no\nismorphisms between the blow ups, except possibly for the two surfaces of type E8 .\nThese, however, have K 2 = 1, so we can not blow up at all.\n7. Einstein metrics on Seifert bundles\nThe main impediment to apply (23) is the current shortage of existence results\nfor positive Ricci curvature K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metrics on orbifolds.\nWe use the following sufficient algebro\u2013geometric condition. There is every reason to expect that it is very far from being optimal, but it does provide a large\nselection of good exmaples.\nIn this paper we use (72) only for surfaces. The concept klt is defined in (73).\n\n\fEINSTEIN METRICS ON 5-DIMENSIONAL SEIFERT BUNDLES\n\n23\n\nTheorem 72. [Nad90, DK01] Let (X, \u2206) be an n-dimensional compact orbifold\nsuch that \u2212(KX + \u2206) is ample. Assume that there is an \u01eb > 0 such that\n(X, \u2206 +\n\nn+\u01eb\nn+1 D)\n\nis klt\n\nfor every effective Q-divisor D \u2261 \u2212(KX +\u2206).

Assume\nthat mKX , mD are both Cartier for some m > 0 (this is automatic if X is an\norbifold). Let g : Y \u2192 X be anyPproper birational morphism, Y smooth. Then\nthere is a unique Q-divisor DY = ei Ei on Y such that\nKY + DY \u2261 g \u2217 (KX + D)\n\nand g\u2217 DY = D.\n\nWe say that (X, D) is klt ( resp. log canonical) if ei < 1 (resp. ei \u2264 1) for every g\nand for every i. We say that (X, D) is canonical if ei \u2264 0 for every g and for every\ni such that Ei is g-exceptional\nIt is quite hard to check using the above definition if a pair (X, D) is klt or not.\nFor surfaces, there are reasonably sharp multiplicity conditions which ensure that\na given pair (X, D) is klt. These conditions are not necessary, but they seem to\napply in most cases of interest to us.\n74 (How to check if (X, D) is klt or not?).\nLet X be a surface with quotient singularities. Let the singular points be Pi \u2208 X\nand we write these locally as\npi : B 2 \u2192 B 2 /Gi\nwhere B 2 is the unit 2\u2013ball and Gi \u2282 GL(2, C) a finite subgroup.

Seifert bundles and rational homology spheres\nWith the aim of constructing new Einstein metrics on homology spheres, one\nwould like to describe all Seifert bundle structures on them.\nIn view of (44), the following is a more detailed version of (5).\nP\nTheorem 78. Let f : L \u2192 (S, (1 \u2212 m1i )Di ) be a 5-dimensional Seifert bundle, L\nsmooth.\n(1) If L\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n\nis a rational homology sphere with H1 (L, Z) = 0 then\nS has only cyclic quotient singularities and H2 (S, Z) \u223c\n= Z,\n= Weil(S) \u223c\nthe Di are orbismooth curves, intersecting transversally,\nthe mi are relatively prime to each other and each mi is relatively\nprime to deg Di \u2208 H2P\n(S, Z) \u223c\n= Z.\n(2) Coversely, given any (S, (1 \u2212 m1i )Di ) satisfying the above 3 conditions\n(1.a,b,c),\nthere is a unique (up to orientation) Seifert bundle f : L \u2192\nP\n(S, (1\u2212 m1i )Di ) such that L is a rational homology sphere with H1 (L, Z) =\n0.\nP\n(3) L is simply connected iff \u03c01orb (S, (1 \u2212 m1i )Di ) = 1.\nP\n(4) L is homeomorphic to S 5 iff \u03c01orb (S, (1 \u2212 m1i )Di ) = 1 and the Di are all\nrational.\n\nThis gives a rather complete answer in terms of algebraic geometry. There is,\nhowever, one missing piece. If (42) is true then we get further restrictions of S:\nP\nConjecture 79. Let f : L \u2192 (S, (1 \u2212 m1i )Di ) be a 5-dimensional Seifert bundle,\nL smooth. If L is a simply connected rational homology sphere then S is a rational\nsurface.\nRemark 80. A rich source of examples, first considered in [OW75], comes from\ntaking S = P2 . If the Di are lines and conics intersecting transversally, the mi are\nrelatively prime to each other and odd for conics, then L is always S 5 .\nBy allowing higher degree curves for the Di , we get many examples of simply\nconnected rational homology spheres. However, not all rational homology spheres\ncan be realized. Indeed, the torsion subgroup of H2 (L, Z) is computed by (50).\nIf H2 (L, Z) is torsion, then S has Picard number one, hence any two curves on S\nintersect. By (25.2) this implies that the mi are relatively prime to each other.\nHence we obtain:\nP\nCorollary 81. Let f : L \u2192 (S, (1 \u2212 m1i )Di ) be a 5-dimensional Seifert bundle,\nL smooth. If L is a rational homology sphere with H1 (L, Z) = 0 then\nX\n(Z/mi )2g(Di )\nH2 (L, Z) \u223c\n=\ni\n\nwhere the mi are relatively prime to each other.\n\n\u0003\n\nThus, for instance, H2 (L, Z) can not be (Z/p)2 + (Z/p2 )2 .\nP\n82 (Proof of (78)). Let us start with f : L \u2192 (S, (1 \u2212 m1i )Di ) such that L is a\nrational homology sphere. By (20) and (25), S has only cyclic quotient singularities,\nthe Di are orbismooth and they intersect transversally. The rest of the conditions\nfollows from (44).\n\n\f26\n\nJ\u00c1NOS KOLL\u00c1R\n\nConversely, start with a surface S with H2 (S, Z) \u223c\n= Weil(S) \u223c\n= Z, with singular\n2\n\u223c\npoints Pi with links Mi with H (Mi , Z) = Z/ni and orbismooth rational curves Di\nof degre di and natural numbers mi .\nQ\nThe ni are pairwise relatively prime by Q\n(43); set N = ni . The mj are pairwise\nrelatively prime\nP by assumption; set M = mj .\nH1orb (S, (1 \u2212 m1i )Di ) = 1 by (44), hence by (49), a Seifert bundle over (S, \u2206)\nis uniquely determined by its Chern class. Furthermore, by (50.2), H1 (L, Z) = 1 iff\n1\nc1 (L/S) = \u00b1 M\n[l] where [l] \u2208 Weil(S) is the positive generator.\nIf Dj does not pass through Pi then ni divides dj := deg Dj since Weil(S) \u2192\nWeil(Pi , S) is surjective by (43) and its kernel is precisely those curves whose degree\nis divisible by ni . Hence in this case mj is relatively prime to ni . If Dj does pass\nthrough Pi then by (25), the multiplicity of the fiber above Pi is divisible by ni mj .\nThus m(X, \u2206) = N M .\nBy (78.1.c) the integers M, dj M/mj are relatively prime, thus\nX d\nj\n1\nbM +\nmj b j = M\nis solvable in integers bM , bj . We can even assume that 0 \u2264 bj < mj and bj is\nnecessarily relatively prime to mj . We identify bM \u2208 Z with a Weil divisor\nPclass\nBM \u2208 Weil(S) \u223c\n= Z. These data determine a Seifert bundle f : L \u2192 (S, (1 \u2212\n1\n1\nmi )Di ). (The solution corresponding to \u2212 M gives a Seifert bundle which differs\nfrom this by reversing the orientation of the cirles.)\nM * c1 (L/S) is a generator of Weil(S), and it generates the local class groups\nWeil(s, S) by (43.3). Thus L is smooth by (30).\nL is a rational homology sphere\nP by (50).\nFinally, \u03c01 (L) = 1 iff \u03c01orb (S, (1 \u2212 m1i )Di ) = 1 by (45).\nL is homeomorphic to S 5 iff it is a simply connected integral homology sphere.\nBy (50), H2 (L, Z) = 0 iff the Di are rational. Duality gives H3 (L, Z) = 0.\n\u0003\nWe are now ready to prove the main theorems of this paper.\nP\n83 (Proof of (4)). Let f : L \u2192 (S, (1 \u2212 m1i )Di ) be a Seifert bundle with\nP\nH1 (L, Z) = 0 such that (S, (1\u2212 m1i )Di ) is a log Del Pezzo orbifold. If tors H2 (L, Z) 6=\n0, then by (50.1), at least one of the curves, say D0 , is nonrational. By (54), all the\nothers are rational and the relationships between the genus of D0 and m0 given in\n(54) give the cases (4.1\u20134).\nThe existence of K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metrics on the following surfaces was established in (76.5):\n(F3 , 54 C), giving H2 (L, Z) = (Z/5)4 , (F4 , 32 C) giving H2 (L, Z) = (Z/3)6 , and\n(F5 , 32 C) giving H2 (L, Z) = (Z/3)8 . (F3 , 34 C) is not orbifold simply connected, so\nfor H2 (L, Z) = (Z/4)4 we need another example. It is given by (Q, 43 C) where\nQ \u2282 P3 is the quadric cone and C \u2282 Q is a smooth degree 5 curve (thus it has to\npass through the vertex). The corresponding Seifert bundle can also be realized as\nthe link of the singularity x5 + y 5 + xz 2 + u4 = 0.\nFor examples with H2 (L, Z) = (Z/m)2 it is probably easiest to use a general\ndegree 1 smooth Del Pezzo surface S and a smooth elliptic member of | \u2212 KS |. The\nconditions of (74) are very easy to check for any m \u2265 2.\nLet Fn be the minimal ruled surface with a negative section E \u2282 Fn with E 2 =\n\u2212n and fiber F . Take a smooth curve C \u2282 |2E + (2n + 3)F | which is transversal\n1\n)E) is a log Del Pezzo surface\nto E. Then g(C) = n + 2 and (Fn , (1 \u2212 21 )C + (1 \u2212 m\n\n\fEINSTEIN METRICS ON 5-DIMENSIONAL SEIFERT BUNDLES\n\n27\n\nfor m > 2n. The conditions of (74) again present no problems for m \u2265 7. These\ngive examples with H2 (L, Z) = (Z/2)2n for any n \u2265 2.\nFinally, an example with H2 (L, Z) = (Z/3)4 can be obtained from (F1 , 23 D + 21 E)\nwhere D \u2208 |2E + 4F |.\n\u0003\n84 (Proof of (6)). By (78), the existence of such Seifert bundles is reduced to a\n1\nquestion about log Del Pezzo surfaces (S, (1 \u2212 m\n)D) where m \u2265 12 and g(D) = 1.\nThese are classified in (56). We get 4 cases:\n1\n(1) (P2 , (1 \u2212 m\n)D) where D is a smooth cubic. We also need 3 6 |m by (78.1.c).\n1\n(2) (Q, (1 \u2212 m )D) where Q \u2282 P3 is a quadric cone and D is its intersection\nwith a quadric. We also need 2 6 |m by (78.1.c).\n1\n)D) where D \u2208 |O(6)| is smooth. [D] is 6 times the\n(3) (P(1, 2, 3), (1 \u2212 m\ngenerator in Weil(S), thus we also need m to be relatively prime to 6 by\n(78.1.c).\n1\n)D) with an embedding S5 \u2282 P5 as a degree 5 surface and D is\n(4) (S5 , (1 \u2212 m\na smooth hyperplane section. [D] is 5 times the generator in Weil(S), thus\nwe also need 5 6 |m by (78.1.c).\n\nThe existence of K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metrics is established in (76.1\u20134).\n\n\u0003\n\n85. Let us compute \u03c01orb (S, \u2206) for each of the 4 cases listed in (84).\nLet l \u2282 S be the line, then D \u223c n * l where n = 3, 4, 6 or 5. Thus OS (n * l) \u223c\n=\nOS (D) gives an n-sheeted ramified cyclic cover h : T \u2192 S and KT = h\u2217 (KS + (1 \u2212\n1\n2\nn )D). Thus we get that \u2212KT is ample and KT = 3, 2, 1, 1 in these 4 cases. T is a\n\u22121\nsmooth Del Pezzo surface and C := red h (D) is a smooth elliptic curve.\nIf C \u2282 P2 is a smooth cubic then \u03c01 (P2 \\ C) = Z/3 but as soon as we blow up\nat least one point on C, the surface will contain a line intersecting C in one point\nonly. Thus \u03c01 (T \\ C) = 1 in all 4 cases and we conclude that \u03c01orb (P2 \\ D) = Z/3,\n\u03c01orb (Q \\ D) = Z/4, \u03c01orb (P(1, 2, 3) \\ D) = Z/6 and \u03c01orb (S5 \\ D) = Z/5.\nOur restrictions on m specify that it be relatively prime to the order of the\ncorresponding \u03c01orb , thus \u03c01orb (S, \u2206) = 1 in all 4 cases.\n86 (Proof of (8)). As before, (55) reduces the first part to the enumeration of all Del\nPezzo surfaces S with cyclic quotient Du Val singularities such that H1orb (S) = 0.\nThis is accomplished in (70). K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metrics are constructed in (77).\nThe second part of (8) follows from (62) and (76.5).\nThis completets the proof of (8).\n\u0003\n9. Links of log terminal singularities\nLet f : Y \u2192 (X, \u2206) be a Seifert C\u2217 -bundle. One can naturally compactify\nit by adding a zero and infinity section, see [Kol04b, 14]. The infinity section is\ncontractible to a singular point iff c1 (Y /X) is ample. As noted by [Pin77, Dem88],\nthis establishes an equivalence between Seifert C\u2217 -bundles with c1 (Y /X) ample and\nsingularities with a good C\u2217 -action.\nThe canonical class of this singularity is Q-Cartier iff the orbifold canonical class\nis a rational multiple of c1 (Y /X). Furthermore, the generalized adjunction formula\n(cf. [Kol92, Sec.16]) implies that the singularity is log terminal iff (X, \u2206) is log\nterminal and \u2212(KX + \u2206) is ample.\nThus we have established an equivalence between:\n\n\f28\n\nJ\u00c1NOS KOLL\u00c1R\n\n(1) Smooth Seifert C\u2217 -bundles f : Y \u2192 (X, \u2206) such that \u2212(KX + \u2206) is ample\nand c1 (Y /X) is a positive multiple of \u2212(KX + \u2206).\n(2) Isolated log terminal singularities with a good C\u2217 -action.\nIt is natural to ask, to what extent the results of this note generalize to arbitrary\nlog terminal singularities.\nProblem 87. Let 0 \u2208 X be an isolated log terminal singularity with link M .\n(1) Is \u03c01 (M ) finite?\n(2) In dimension 3, do the restrictions of (4) also apply to M ?\n(3) Is there any connection between the log terminality of X and the existence\nof positive Ricci curvature metrics on M ?\n(4) Can one obtain Einstein metrics on links without C\u2217 -action?\nLog canonical singularities with C\u2217 -action lead to Seifert C\u2217 -bundles whose base\nis a Calabi\u2013Yau orbifold:\nP\nProposition 88. Let f : L \u2192 (X, (1 \u2212 m1i )Di ) be a Seifert bundle, L smooth.\nP\nAssume that H1 (L, Z) = 0 and (X, (1 \u2212 m1i )Di ) is a Calabi\u2013Yau orbifold, that is,\nP\nKX + (1 \u2212 m1i )Di is numerically trivial.\nP\nThen (1 \u2212 m1i )Di = 0 and X is a Calabi\u2013Yau orbifold with trivial canonical\nclass.\nP\nProof. If (1 \u2212 m1i )Di 6= 0, pick a prime p dividing at least one of the mi . Let\nP\nus clear denominators in (1 \u2212 m1i )Di \u2261 \u2212KX and rewrite this as\nP\ni:p|mi ai Di \u223c p * (integral Weil divisor),\nP\nwhere not all the ai are divisible by p. Thus by (37) we get that H1orb (X, (1 \u2212\n1\nmi )Di ) 6= 0, a contradiction to H1 (L, Z) = 0.\nThus the canonical class is torsion. Thus it gives a torsion element of H 2 (X \\\nSing X, Z) which is, however, torsion free since H1 (X \\ Sing X, Z) = 0. Thus the\ncanonical class is trivial.\n\u0003\nIn dimension 5, one can be even more precise, as conjectured by Galicki:\nP\nCorollary 89. Let f : L \u2192 (S, (1 \u2212 m1i )Di ) be a 5\u2013dimensional Seifert bundle, L\nP\nsmooth. Assume that H1 (L, Z) = 0 and (S, (1 \u2212 m1i )Di ) is a Calabi\u2013Yau orbifold.\nThen\n(1) the minimal resolution of S is a K3-surface, and\n(2) L is homeomorphic to the connected sum of at most 21 copies of S 2 \u00d7 S 3 .\nProof. By (88), S is a simply connected orbifold with trivial canonical class.\nIn dimension 2 cyclic quotient singularities with trivial canonical class are Du Val.\nLet h : S \u2032 \u2192 S be the minimal resolution. Then KS \u2032 = h\u2217 KS and H1 (S \u2032 , Z) =\n0. Therefore S \u2032 is a K3 surface and rank H 2 (S, Q) \u2264 rank H 2 (S \u2032 , Q) = 22, the\nmaximum achieved in the smooth case only.\n(It may happen that S \u2032 is a K3 surface but \u03c01orb (S) 6= 1. A famous example is\nthe Kummer surface, a quotient of an Abelian surface by p 7\u2192 \u2212p. In this case\n\u03c01orb (S) sits in an exact sequence\n0 \u2192 Z4 \u2192 \u03c01orb (S) \u2192 Z/2 \u2192 0.\nThere are numerous similar cases, classified by [Muk88].)\n\n\fEINSTEIN METRICS ON 5-DIMENSIONAL SEIFERT BUNDLES\n\n29\n\nSince there is no branch divisor, (50) shows that H2 (L, Z) is torsion free. The\nsecond Stiefel\u2013Whitney class is zero by (90). Therefore L is homeomorphic to the\nconnected sum of at most 21 copies of S 2 \u00d7 S 3 by (3).\n\u0003\nThe following lemma is essentially in [Mor97, BGN03a].\nLemma 90. Let f : L \u2192 (X, \u2206) be a Seifert bundle. Assume that H1 (L, Z) = 0\nand that KX + \u2206 is a rational multiple of c1 (L/X). Then w2 (L) = 0.\nProof. L is an orientable hypersurface in the corresponding Seifert C\u2217 -bundle\nY \u2192 S and w2 (L) = c1 (Y )|L mod 2. By [Kol04b, 41 and 16],\nc1 (Y ) = \u2212KY = f \u2217 (KX + \u2206) = c * f \u2217 c1 (Y /X) = 0\nin rational cohomology. Since H1 (L, Z) = 0, the second cohomology has no torsion\nthus c1 (Y ) = 0 and also w2 (L) = 0.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[BG00]\n\nCharles P.
