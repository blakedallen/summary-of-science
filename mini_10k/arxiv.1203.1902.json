Introduction\nEffective medium semi-empirical theories, such as the k\u22c5p method [1] or Bastard's\nenvelope function approximation [2], have become invaluable tools to characterize the\nelectronic properties of bulk semiconductors and related heterostructures, and associated\ndevices. Such treatments are made possible by the fact that the most relevant physical\nphenomena in semiconductors are determined by the form of the electronic structure in\nthe vicinity of some high symmetry points in the momentum space. The k\u22c5p methods are\nbased on perturbation theory [3], and enable the calculation of the band structure and\neffective masses of different types of semiconductors (e.g. with zincblende structure).\nOn the other hand, stimulated by the development of electromagnetic metamaterials [4][6], recently there has been an intense research of methods that permit characterizing\nperiodic structures from an effective medium perspective, typically through the\nintroduction of an effective permittivity and an effective permeability [7]-[13]. It is thus\nnatural to wonder if some of these ideas and methods can be extended to the\ncharacterization of matter waves, in the context of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\nThe objective of this work is precisely, by generalizing our previous studies in the\ncontext of electromagnetic metamaterials [12, 13], to bridge two fields and to develop\nfrom first principles a systematic approach that enables the computation of an effective\nHamiltonian that describes within some approximations the time evolution of a quantum\nsystem, and that reduces drastically the complexity of the problem. Our analysis neglects\nelectron-electron interactions, and thus many body effects. In some cases, these effects\nmay be modeled by an effective potential.\n\n-2-\n\n\fWe apply the developed theory to the case of one-dimensional graphene superlattices. It\nis demonstrated that the low-energy physics in these structures can be described simply in\nterms of an energy dependent effective potential and an anisotropy tensor that\ncharacterizes the pseudospin. Based on this effective medium model, we predict a novel\nperfect tunneling effect in graphene superlattices, showing that electron waves with a\nspecific energy can be perfectly tunneled through a nanomaterial with specific properties.\n\nII. Effective Medium Approach\nThe starting point of our analysis is the one-body Schr\u00f6dinger equation for an electron in\nsome periodic structure (e.g. a crystalline material or a superlattice),\n\n\u0124 \u03c8 = ih\n\n\u2202\n\u03c8 .\n\u2202t\n\n(1)\n\nLet us suppose that the initial state is described by \u03c8 ( r, t = 0 ) , where\n\n\u03c8 \u03c3 ( r, t ) = r\u03c3 | \u03c8 ( t )\n\nand \u03c3 labels additional degrees of freedom associated for\n\nexample with the electron spin or (in case of graphene) the pseudospin. Our objective is\n\u2013 in the same spirit of the pseudopotential theory used for calculating electronic band\nstructures [14] \u2013 to obtain an effective Schr\u00f6dinger equation satisfied by the smooth part\nof the wavefunction. To this end, it is convenient to introduce some form of spatial\naveraging, represented by a linear operator\n\n{ }av .\n\nThe operator\n\n{ }av\n\nis completely\n\ndetermined by the response function F ( k ) such that {eik \u22c5r } = F ( k ) eik \u22c5r . In this work,\nav\n\nwe suppose that \u0124 describes a spatially-periodic system (e.g. a periodic superlattice) and\nassume that\n\n{ }av\n\ncorresponds to a low pass spatial filter, such that F ( k ) = 0 for k\n\n-3-\n\n\foutside the first Brillouin zone (B.Z.), and F ( k ) = 1 otherwise. For example, if \u03c8 \u03c3 ( r,t )\nis a superposition of plane waves, \u03c8 \u03c3 ( r, t ) = \u2211 bk eik \u22c5r , then the macroscopic\nk\n\nwavefunction resulting from spatial averaging is:\n\n{\u03c8 \u03c3 }av ( r, t ) = \u2211\n\nk\u2208B . Z .\n\nbk eik \u22c5r .\n\n(2)\n\nThus, only the spatial harmonics with k within the first Brillouin zone are retained after\nthe spatial filtering. This type of spatial filtering is usually designated by ideal low-pass\nfiltering.\nBy definition, a \"macroscopic\" state has the property\n\n{\u03c8 ( r )}\n\nav\n\n= \u03c8 ( r ) , i.e. a\n\nmacroscopic state is unaffected by the spatial averaging. In particular, a \"macroscopic\nstate\" cannot be more localized than the characteristic period of the material (or\nsuperlattice). As proven in Appendix A, a macroscopic state \u03c8\n\nis a superposition of\n\nstates of the form k\u03c3 , with k in the first Brillouin zone. Similar definitions can be\nintroduced in the context of electromagnetic metamaterials [12, 13], where the role of the\nmacroscopic state is played by the macroscopic electromagnetic fields.\nIn Appendix A, it is shown that provided the initial state \u03c8 ( 0 ) is macroscopic, then the\nsmooth part of the wavefunction in the r\u03c3\n\nrepresentation, \u03a8 ( r, t ) \u2261 {\u03c8 ( r, t )}av ,\n\nsatisfies exactly an homogenized Schr\u00f6dinger equation of the form,\n\n( H\u02c6 \u03a8 ) ( r, t ) = ih \u2202\u2202t \u03a8 ( r, t )\nef\n\n-4-\n\n(3)\n\n\fwhere H\u02c6 ef is the effective Hamiltonian of the system, defined in such a way that\n\n( H\u02c6 \u03a8 ) ( r, t ) = {( H\u02c6\u03c8 ) ( r, t )}\nef\n\nwhere\n\nav\n\n( H\u02c6\u03c8 )\n\n\u03c3\n\n( r, t ) = r\u03c3 | H\u02c6 |\u03c8\n\n.\n\nThe\n\neffective\n\nHamiltonian can be written explicitly in terms of matrix elements h\u03c3 ,\u03c3 \u2032 , as follows\n\n(\n\nH\u02c6 ef \u03a8\n\nt\n\n) = \u2211 \u222b d r\u2032\u222b dt\u2032 h\nN\n\n\u03c3\n\n\u03c3 ,\u03c3 \u2032\n\n\u03c3\u2032\n\n( r \u2212 r\u2032, t \u2212 t \u2032) \u03a8\u03c3 \u2032 ( r\u2032, t \u2032) .\n\n(4)\n\n0\n\nwhere N is the dimension of the system (e.g. N=2 for a graphene sheet). Notice that the\n\"microscopic\" wavefunction is denoted by \u03c8 ( r,t ) , whereas the macroscopic\nwavefunction (after spatial averaging) is denoted by \u03a8 ( r,t ) . The indicated properties of\nh\u03c3 ,\u03c3 \u2032 ( r, t ) imply that its Fourier transform (unilateral in time and bilateral in space),\n+\u221e\n\nh\u03c3 ,\u03c3 \u2032 ( k , \u03c9 ) = \u222b d N r \u222b dt h\u03c3 ,\u03c3 \u2032 ( r, t ) ei\u03c9t e\u2212 ik \u22c5r .\n\n(5)\n\n( H\u02c6 \u03a8 )\n\n(6)\n\n0\n\nis such that\nef\n\n\u03c3\n\n( k , \u03c9 ) = \u2211 h\u03c3 ,\u03c3 \u2032 ( k , \u03c9 ) \u03a8\u03c3 \u2032 ( k , \u03c9 ) .\n\u03c3\u2032\n\n+\u221e\n\n(\n\nwhere \u03a8\u03c3 ( k , \u03c9 ) = \u222b d r \u222b dt \u03a8\u03c3 ( r, t ) ei\u03c9t e \u2212ik \u22c5r and H\u02c6 ef \u03a8\nN\n\n0\n\n)\n\n\u03c3\n\n(k, \u03c9 )\n\nis defined similarly\n\n(the convergence of the Fourier transform is guaranteed for Im {\u03c9} > 0 ). Hence, in the\n\n(\n\nFourier domain the relation between H\u02c6 ef \u03a8\n\n)\n\nand \u03a8 is a simple multiplication. It is\n\ninteresting to mention that h\u03c3 ,\u03c3 \u2032 ( k , \u03c9 ) vanishes identically when k is outside the first\nBrillouin zone (see Appendix A), and this confirms that the effective Hamiltonian is\nindeed a \"smooth operator\" as compared to the original Hamiltonian.\n\n-5-\n\n\fLet us discuss how h\u03c3 ,\u03c3 \u2032 ( k , \u03c9 ) can be calculated in practice. As mentioned previously,\nthe key property of the effective Hamiltonian is that if the initial state of system is\n\n{\u03c8 ( r, t = 0 )}\n\n\"macroscopic\", i.e. if\n\n( H\u02c6\u03c8 )\n\n\u03c3\n\n= r\u03c3 | H\u02c6 | \u03c8\n\n\u0124 \u03c8 = ih\n\nav\n\n(with \u03c8\n\n= \u03c8 ( r, t = 0 ) , then the result of averaging\n\nthe exact solution of the microscopic problem:\n\n\u2202\n\u03c8 ) is exactly the same as that of applying the effective Hamiltonian to the\n\u2202t\n\naveraged wavefunction \u03a8 ( r, t ) = {\u03c8 ( r, t )}av . In particular, suppose that the initial state is\nsuch that \u03c8 \u03c3 ( r, t = 0 ) = eik \u22c5r\u03b4\u03c3 ,\u03c3 \u2032 and suppose that \u03c8 ( r,t ) is the corresponding exact\nsolution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (here k is fixed in the first Brillouin zone and \u03c3 \u2032 is\nalso fixed), and \u03c8 ( r, \u03c9 ) is the corresponding (unilateral) Fourier transform in time.\nTaking into account that because of the assumed periodicity of the system in the spatial\n\n( )\n\ndomain both \u03c8 ( r, \u03c9 ) and H\u02c6 \u03c8\nvector\n\nk,\n\nit\n\nis\n\ntrivial\n\n\u03c3\n\nto\n\n( r, \u03c9 )\nverify\n\nmust be Bloch modes associated with the wave\n\n{( H\u02c6\u03c8 ) }\n\nthat\n\n\u03c3\n\nav\n\n( r, \u03c9 ) = ( H\u02c6\u03c8 )\u03c3 ,av eik\u22c5r\n\nand\n\n{\u03c8 \u03c3 }av ( r, \u03c9 ) = \u03c8 \u03c3 ,av eik\u22c5r , where\n\u03c8 \u03c3 ,av (\u03c9 ) =\n\n( H\u02c6\u03c8 )\n\n\u03c3 ,av\n\n1\nd N r \u03c8 \u03c3 ( r, \u03c9 )e \u2212ik \u22c5r ,\n\u222b\nVcell \u03a9\n\n(\u03c9 ) =\n\n( )\n\n1\nd N r H\u02c6 \u03c8\n\u222b\nVcell \u03a9\n\n\u03c3\n\n( r, \u03c9 )e\u2212ik\u22c5r .\n\n(7a)\n\n(7b)\n\nwhere Vcell is the volume of the unit cell. Substituting these formulas into Eq.

(ii) determine \u03c8 ( r, \u03c9 ) and\n\n( \u0124\u03c8 )\n\nafterwards \u03c8 av (\u03c9 ) and\n\nav\n\n( H\u02c6\u03c8 ) ( r, \u03c9 ) , and\n\ndefined consistently with Eq. (7). (iii) determine\n\nh\u03c3 ,\u03c3 \u2032 ( k , \u03c9 ) such that Eq. (8) is identically satisfied. In general, to obtain every\n\ncomponent of h\u03c3 ,\u03c3 \u2032 ( k , \u03c9 ) , one needs to solve several \"microscopic\" problems: as many\nas the degrees of freedom associated with \u03c3 \u2032 in the initial time boundary condition\n\n\u03c8 \u03c3 ( r, t = 0 ) ~ eik \u22c5r\u03b4 \u03c3 ,\u03c3 \u2032 . It can be verified that the effective Hamiltonian ( h\u03c3 ,\u03c3 \u2032 ( k , \u03c9 ) )\nconsidered here in the context of matter waves is the analogue of the spatially dispersive\neffective dielectric function introduced in Refs. [12, 13] in the context of electromagnetic\nmetamaterials. The explicit relation between the two formalisms is given in Appendix B.\nAn important property of the effective Hamiltonian is that the corresponding energy\neigenstates En , which satisfy for some non-trivial \u03a8\n\n( H\u02c6 \u03a8 )\nef\n\n\u03c9 = En / h\n\n= En \u03a8 ,\n\n(9)\n\nare exactly coincident with the energy eigenstates of the microscopic Hamiltonian.\nTherefore the electronic band structure of the microscopic Hamiltonian can be computed\nfrom the effective Hamiltonian. Strictly speaking, it should be mentioned that if an\nenergy eigenvector of the microscopic Hamiltonian has a trivial projection into the\nsubspace of macroscopic states, then the corresponding eigenvalue is not shared by H\u02c6 ef\n\n-7-\n\n\fand \u0124 . This can only occur in degenerate singular cases, and for very specific forms of\nthe microscopic Hamiltonian, and thus typically the electronic band structures of the\nmicroscopic and effective Hamiltonians are indeed the same. The enunciated properties\nare demonstrated in Appendix C.\n\nIII. Graphene Superlattices\nIn the rest of the paper, we illustrate the application of the proposed homogenization\nmethod to the case of a graphene superlattice. Graphene is a one-atom-thick material\nwhose low-energy excitations are massless, chiral, Dirac fermions [15]. Its unusual\nelectronic properties make it a unique platform for the development of novel electronic\ndevices with superior characteristics [16, 17, 18] and for flatland transformation optics\n[19]. Here, we will obtain an effective medium model for a graphene superlattice\ncharacterized by a 1D-electrostatic periodic potential, whose geometry is sketched in Fig.\n1. Some recent works have shown that these graphene superlattices may be used to\ncollimate an electron beam with virtually no spatial spreading or diffraction [20, 21];\nquite differently here we concentrate on the effective medium description of electron\nwaves in the superlattices, and highlight how by tailoring the microscopic potential one\ncan control the \"macroscopic\" Hamiltonian of the quantum system.\nThe charge carriers in a graphene superlattice are described by the massless Dirac-type\nequation,\n\n\u2212ihvF ( \u03c3 \u22c5\u2207 )\u03c8 + V ( r )\u03c8 = ih\n\n\u2202\u03c8\n,\n\u2202t\n\n(10)\n\nwhere vF ~ 106 m / s , \u03c3 = ( \u03c3 x , \u03c3 y ) , \u03c3 x , \u03c3 y are the Pauli matrices, and V is the external\n\nperiodic electrostatic potential. Here, without loss of generality, we restrict the analysis to\n\n-8-\n\n\fthe study of electrons whose transport properties are determined by the Dirac K point\n[15]. The wavefunction \u03c8 has two components (it is a pseudo-spinor), each component,\n\n\u03c8 m with m = 1, 2 , being associated with a different trigonal sublattice of graphene. To\nobtain the effective Hamiltonian hm ,n ( k , \u03c9 ) ,\n\nm, n = 1, 2 , it is sufficient to determine\n\n\u03c8 (l ) ( r, \u03c9 ) , i.e. the (unilateral) Fourier transform of the wavefunction \u03c8 (l ) ( r, t )\nassociated with an initial state of the form \u03c8 ( l ) m ( r, t = 0 ) = eik \u22c5r\u03b4 m ,l where k is measured\nwith respect to the Dirac K point and l = 1, 2 . It should be noted that the electron spin\nplays no role in the absence of an external magnetic field, and hence hm ,n ( k , \u03c9 ) can be\nregarded a 2\u00d72 matrix. As mentioned previously, the effective medium description is\nvalid provided the initial electron state is not more localized than the characteristic period\na of the superlattice, i.e. provided k is inside the first Brillouin mini-zone of the\nsuperlattice.\nFrom\n\nthe\n\nproperties\n\nof\n\nthe\n\n(unilateral)\n\nFourier\n\ntransform,\n\nusing\n\n\u2202\u03c8\n( r, t ) \u2194 \u2212i\u03c9\u03c8 ( r, \u03c9 ) \u2212\u03c8 t =0 ( r ) , it is evident that \u03c8 (l ) ( r, \u03c9 ) satisfies the time\u2202t\nindependent equation:\nl\nl\n\u23a1\u23a3 \u2212ihvF ( \u03c3 \u22c5\u2207 ) + V ( r ) \u2212 h\u03c9 \u23a4\u23a6\u03c8 ( ) = \u2212ih\u03c8 ( ) ( r, t = 0 )\n\n(11)\n\nNotice that Eq. (11) is a non-homogeneous equation, where the initial time boundary\ncondition \u2212ih\u03c8 ( l ) ( r, t = 0 ) plays the role of a \"source\". On the other hand, it is\nstraightforward to verify from Eq. (10) that\n\n-9-\n\n( H\u02c6\u03c8 )\n\nav\n\n= hvF ( \u03c3 \u22c5 k )\u03c8 av + (V\u03c8 )av , where\n\n\f(V\u03c8 )av\n\nis defined as \u03c8 av in Eq. (7a), with \u03c8 replaced by V\u03c8 . Hence, hm ,n ( k , \u03c9 ) is of\n\nthe form,\nhm ,n ( k , \u03c9 ) = \u23a1\u23a3 hvF ( \u03c3 \u22c5 k ) \u23a4\u23a6 m, n + Vef , mn ( k , \u03c9 )\n\n(12)\n\nbeing Vef , mn ( k , \u03c9 ) such that\n\n(V\u03c8 )m,av = \u2211 Vef ,mn ( k , \u03c9 )\u03c8 n,av .\n\n(13)\n\nn\n\nHence, for fixed ( k , \u03c9 ) the simplest way to determine the effective Hamiltonian is to\nsolve Eq. (11) for l=1,2, and after this to compute the matrix Vef ( k , \u03c9 ) such that\n\u22121\n\n(1)\n(2)\nVef ( k , \u03c9 ) = \u23a1(V\u03c8 )av ; (V\u03c8 )av \u23a4 \u22c5 \u23a1\u23a3\u03c8 av(1) ; \u03c8 av(2) \u23a4\u23a6 .\n\u23a3\n\u23a6\n\n(14)\n\nwhere the symbol \";\" separates the columns of the 2\u00d72 matrices. Evidently, in general,\nEq. (11) needs to be solved numerically.\nIt is clear from the previous discussions, that in general Vef exhibits spatial dispersion\n(dependence on k \u2194 \u2212i\u2207 ) and time dispersion (dependence on \u03c9 , or equivalently on\nthe energy E = h\u03c9 ), and this introduces some complexity in the effective medium model.\nThis is fully analogous to electromagnetic metamaterials, where in general the effective\ndielectric response depends on frequency and wave vector [12,13]. In order to further\nsimplify the model, we consider the case where the spatial dispersion is weak so that it is\npossible\n\nto\n\napproximate\n\nVef ( k , \u03c9 ) \u2248 Vef (\u03c9 ) +\n\ndVef\ndk x\n\nVef\nkx +\n\n( 0,\u03c9 )\n\nby\n\nits\n\ndVef\ndk y\n\nTaylor\n\nky\n\nseries\n\nof\n\nfirst\n\norder\n\nin\n\nk,\n\nwith Vef (\u03c9 ) \u2261 Vef ( 0, \u03c9 ) . Taking into\n\n( 0,\u03c9 )\n\naccount the symmetries of the microscopic Hamiltonian, it is simple to verify that Vef (\u03c9 )\n\n-10-\n\n\fis a scalar. Within this approximation, using Eqs. (4) and (12), it is seen that the effective\nHamiltonian of the superlattice is such that:\n\n( H\u02c6 \u03a8 ) ( r, \u03c9 ) = \u23a1\u23a3\u2212ihv \u03c3\nef\n\nF\n\nef\n\n(\u03c9 ) \u22c5\u2207 + Vef (\u03c9 ) \u23a4\u23a6 \u22c5 \u03a8 ( r, \u03c9 )\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03a8 is a pseudo-spinor and \u03c3 ef (\u03c9 ) \u2261 ( \u03c3 x ,ef , \u03c3 y ,ef ) with,\n\u03c3 ef , x = \u03c3 x +\n\n1 dVef\nhvF dk x\n\nand\n\n\u03c3 ef , y = \u03c3 y +\n\n( 0,\u03c9 )\n\n1 dVef\nhvF dk y\n\n.\n\n(16)\n\n( 0,\u03c9 )\n\nIn order to understand how the effective parameters vary with the energy, so that the\nmodel can be further simplified, in the next section we consider a numerical example.\n\nIV. Numerical Example\nIn Fig. 2, we depict the numerically calculated effective parameters as a function of\nE = h\u03c9 , for a superlattice characterized by a Kr\u00f6nig-Penney type electrostatic potential\n\nwith V1 = \u2212V2 , d1 = d 2 = a / 2 , and for the normalized potential amplitude V1a / hvF = 6.0 .\nThe effective potential tensor Vef ( k , \u03c9 ) was calculated semi-analytically by solving Eq.\n(11) by matching plane wave modes at the interfaces between different regions,\nanalogous to what is done when solving a scattering problem [22]. Very interestingly,\nthe numerical results show that to an excellent approximation (Fig. 2b)\n\u03c3 ef \u2248 vr , xx ( E ) \u03c3 x x\u02c6 + vr , yy ( E ) \u03c3 y y\u02c6 ,\n\n.\n\n(17)\n\nwhere vr ,ii ( E ) are some scalars weakly dependent on E and \u03c3 i are the Pauli matrices.\nThe pseudospin is characterized by \u03c3 ef which can be written as \u03c3 ef = \u03c3 \u22c5 vr with\n\u02c6 \u02c6 + vr , yy yy\n\u02c6\u02c6 .\nvr = vr , xx xx\n\nWe shall refer to vr as the anisotropy tensor of the superlattice,\n\n-11-\n\n\fand neglect its dependence on E (due to its weak dependence on energy). On the other\nhand, the effective potential Vef (at k = 0 ) for low-energy excitations varies linearly with\n\nE so that,\nVef \u2248 \u2212\u03b1 E ,\n\n.\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is a dimensionless positive constant. Notice that in pristine graphene\nvr ,ii ( E ) = 1 and \u03b1 = 0 .\n\nAs discussed in Sect. II, the stationary states of the energy operator can be characterized\nusing the developed effective medium approach, and the eigenvalues E of the\nmicroscopic \u0124 Hamiltonian, are the same as the eigenvalues of the exact effective\nHamiltonian H\u02c6 ef . In particular, within the validity of Eq. (15), the energy dispersion of\nthe graphene superlattice at the Dirac K point can be obtained by solving the eigenvalue\nproblem\n\n\u23a1\u23a3 \u2212ihvF \u03c3 ef \u22c5\u2207 + Vef (\u03c9 ) \u23a4\u23a6 \u22c5 \u03a8 = E \u03a8 .\nFor\n\na\n\nspatial\n\nE \u2212 Vef = hvF\n\nvariation\n\n(v\n\nk\n\nr , xx x\n\nof\n\n) + (v\n2\n\nr , yy\n\nthe\n\ntype\n\neik \u22c5r ,\n\n.\nthis\n\nyields\n\n(19)\nthe\n\ndispersion\n\nk y ) . In the case where vr ,ii are independent of the\n2\n\nenergy and Vef \u2248 \u2212\u03b1 E , it is simple to check that the group energy velocity for\npropagation in the x-direction is: vg , x = h \u22121\u2202 k x E = vF vr , xx / (1 + \u03b1 ) . On the other hand,\nbecause of the Klein tunneling effect [15], it is evident that vg , x = vF . This indicates that\nfor this particular superlattice the effective parameters vr , xx and \u03b1 are such that\nvr , xx = 1 + \u03b1 .\n\n.\n\n-12-\n\n(20)\n\n\fWe have indeed verified that the numerically calculated effective parameters satisfy\nexactly this relation. In particular, it follows that energy dispersion of the superlattice\nmay be written simply as\nE = hvF k x2 + \u03c7 2 k y2 ,\n\n.\n\n(21)\n\nwhere \u03c7 = vr , yy / vr , xx is by definition the anisotropy ratio. The \"exact\" energy dispersion\nof a graphene superlattice with V1a / hvF = 6.0 is depicted in Fig. 3a, and is compared\nwith our effective medium theory in Fig. 3b, revealing a very good agreement between\nboth theories. As seen in Fig. 3a, consistent with the results of Ref. [21], the graphene\nsuperlattice is strongly anisotropic, and the usual Dirac cone of pristine graphene is\nstretched along the y-direction.\nThe pseudo-spinor associated with a state of energy E and wave vector k is,\n\u03a8=\n\n1 \u239b 1 \u239e ik \u22c5r\n\u239c i\u03b8 \u239f e\n2 \u239c\u239d se q \u239f\u23a0\n\nwhere \u03b8q is the angle between the vector\ns = sgn ( E \u2212 Vef\n\n)\n\n(22)\n\n(v\n\nk , vr , yy k y ) and the x-axis and\n\nr , xx x\n\n[within the approximation Vef \u2248 \u2212\u03b1 E , we may also write that\n\ns = sgn ( E ) ]. Thus, the pseudospin of the averaged wavefunction is determined by \u03b8q ,\n\nand hence by the parameters vr ,ii . Since vr , xx = 1 + \u03b1 > 1 , the angle \u03b8q may also be defined\nas the angle between q \u2261 ( k x , \u03c7 k y ) and the x-axis (Fig. 4b). Thus, in the case where the\nsuperlattice is characterized by strong anisotropy with \u03c7 << 1 the pseudospin is such that\neither \u03b8q \u2248 0 or \u03b8q \u2248 \u03c0 . A similar result was reported in Ref. [21], based on direct band\nstructure calculations. It should be noted that, unlike in pristine graphene, \u03b8q \u2260 \u03b8k , where\n\n-13-\n\n\f\u03b8k is the angle between k and the x-axis (Fig. 4b). Evidently, the angle \u03b8q determines\nthe relative phase of the wavefunction in the two sublattices of graphene.\nIn Fig. 2c-d we plot vr ,ii and \u03c7 (evaluated for E \u2248 0 ), respectively, as a function of the\nnormalized potential V1 . As seen, the anisotropy ratio can be quite large if V1a / hvF ~ 2\u03c0 ,\nwhich is when the parameter vr , yy crosses zero. This extreme regime of operation may\npermit a supercollimation of an electron beam [21].\n\nV. Perfect Tunneling\nOne of the most striking features of Fig. 2d is the fact that \u03c7 can be negative for an\napplied potential with normalized amplitude V1a / hvF > 6.3 . What are the physical\nconsequences of a reversed sign for the anisotropy ratio? To answer this question we\nconsider two graphene based nanomaterials described by the effective parameters \u03c71 and\n\n\u03c7 2 such that \u03c71 = \u2212 \u03c7 2 \u2261 \u03c7 and \u03c71 > 0 , where \u03c7 i = ( vr , yy / vr , xx )i . At a microscopic level\nthese nanomaterials may be regarded as superlattices characterized by a suitable\nmicroscopic potential, consistent with the previous discussions. Moreover, we assume\nthat there is a static potential offset \u03b4 V between the nanomaterials, so that the energy\ndispersion of the stationary modes in the first material is E = hvF k x2 + \u03c7 2 k y2 , whereas\nthe dispersion in the second material is E \u2212 \u03b4 V = hvF k x2 + \u03c7 2 k y2 . We say that the\npseudospin of a material is positive when \u03c7 i > 0 and that the pseudospin is negative if\n\n\u03c7 i < 0 . Consider now the geometry depicted in Fig. 4d, which shows a rectangular slab\nof the second material embedded in the first material. Using the developed effective\n\n-14-\n\n\fmedium theory, it is straightforward to compute the transmissivity for a stationary state\n(plane wave) that describes an electron incident from the left region, x < 0 , on the slab of\nthe material with negative anisotropy. This is done by expanding the wave function in the\ndifferent regions into plane wave modes, and ensuring the continuity of the pseudospinors at the interfaces (see Appendix D). In Fig. 4c the transmissivity is shown as a\nfunction of the transverse wave number ( k y ) of the incoming particle, for different values\nof the energy. Quite interestingly, it is seen that there is a perfect tunneling \u2013 independent\nof the direction of incidence of the incoming particle \u2013 when the energy is E = \u03b4 V / 2\n(green curve). This is distinctively different from Klein tunneling [15], which only occurs\nfor k y = 0 , whereas in our case the incident electron tunnels through the second material,\nindependent of the angle of incidence! The tunneling phenomenon at E = \u03b4 V / 2 can be\neasily understood on the basis of the effective medium theory. Indeed, taking into\naccount that the energy level E = \u03b4 V / 2 is in the conduction band of the first material\nand in the valence band of the second material (Fig. 4a), and that for such a value of E the\nenergy dispersions of both materials are coincident, it follows that if the pseudo-spinor of\n\u239b 1 \u239e ik y\nthe incident wave is \u03a81 ~ \u239c\u239c i\u03b8q ,1 \u239f\u239f e y eik x x then the pseudo-spinor of the wave that\n\u239de \u23a0\n\u239b 1 \u239e ik y\npropagates in the second material along the positive x-direction is \u03a8 2 ~ \u239c\u239c i\u03b8q ,2 \u239f\u239f e y e \u2212ikx x .\n\u239d \u2212e \u23a0\n\n\u239b 1 \u239e\n\u239b 1 \u239e\nBut since \u03c71 = \u2212 \u03c7 2 \u2261 \u03c7 it is evident that \u03b8q ,1 = \u03b8q ,2 + \u03c0 , and hence \u239c\u239c i\u03b8q ,1 \u239f\u239f and \u239c\u239c i\u03b8q ,2 \u239f\u239f\n\u239de \u23a0\n\u239d \u2212e \u23a0\nare equal (see Fig. 4b). This implies perfect matching at the interfaces, and hence perfect\ntransmission independent of the angle of incidence. It is interesting to point out that there\n\n-15-\n\n\fis an evident parallelism between our graphene-based nanomaterial with negative\npseudospin and double negative (DNG) electromagnetic metamaterials, as proposed in\n[4]. Indeed, similar to electromagnetic metamaterials, our graphene-based nanomaterial\nmay provide perfect focusing and negative refraction of electrons with the energy\nE = \u03b4 V / 2 , when the source of electrons is at a distance W / 2 from the slab of the\n\nsecond material (Fig. 4d). A graphene analogue of Veselago-Pendry's lens has been\nproposed in an earlier publication [17], however very different from the configuration\nconsidered here, a p-n graphene junction can only mimic Veselago-Pendry's lens under a\nsemi-classical approximation because the electron transmissivity there is very different\nfrom unity for wide incident angles. Moreover, our solution here behaves as a perfect lens\neven for incoming electron waves characterized by a complex wave vector k1 = ( k x1 , k y ) ,\ni.e. for states such that k y > k y ,max where k y ,max = E / ( \u03c71hvF ) is the transverse wave\nvector for grazing incidence. For such complex states, which strictly speaking are nonnormalizable, k x1 is pure imaginary, and the transmissivity of the structure is exactly\n2\n\nT = e \u2212 i 2 k x1W > 1 (growing exponential: see Fig. 4c), which similarly to Pendry's lens\n\ncompensates for the exponential decay in the outside regions [4]. Even though the\nmentioned complex states are non-normalizable this result is full of physical significance.\nFor example, consider the stationary states in the scenario where an arbitrary localized\nexternal perturbation (e.g. a potential well or barrier somewhere in the region x < 0 ) is\nintroduced in the first material. Since two materials with opposite pseudospin completely\nannihilate one another when E = \u03b4 V / 2 , this means that a pair of such materials may be\n\n-16-\n\n\f\"inserted\" into the considered structure in the region x > 0 without changing in any\nmanner the stationary states associated with E = \u03b4 V / 2 in the region x < 0 .\nIt is natural to wonder if the material with positive pseudospin in the scenario of Fig. 4\nmay be chosen as pristine graphene.\n\nThis requires that \u03c71 = 1 and thus \u03c7 2 = \u22121 .\n\nUnfortunately, it can be checked in Fig. 2c that the minimum value for 1/ \u03c7 , with\n\n\u03c7 < 0 , for a superlattice characterized by a Kronig-Penney type potential is about 4.6 .\nHowever, this does not preclude that for a different profile of the microscopic potential,\n1/ \u03c7 cannot be made smaller. For example, by solving the effective medium problem\n\nnumerically using a finite-difference method, we calculated 1/ \u03c7 as a function of V1 for a\n\u239b 2\u03c0 \u239e\nx \u239f (the unit cell is discretized as\nmicroscopic potential of the form V ( x ) = V1 sin \u239c\n\u239d a \u23a0\nN \u00d7 N array of nodes and the derivatives are replaced by finite differences; then the\n\nproblem is reduced to the solution of a linear system). The obtained result is represented\nin Fig. 2d with a dashed line. As seen, for this alternative potential the minimum value of\n1/ \u03c7 (with \u03c7 < 0 ) is reduced to 2.5 . This is still far from \u03c7 2 = \u22121 , but indicates that by\n\ntailoring the shape of the microscopic potential it may at least be possible to better\napproximate the value \u03c7 2 = \u22121 .\n\nVI. Conclusion\nIn conclusion, we have described a completely general self-consistent approach (many\nbody effects are however neglected) to characterize electron waves in periodic systems\nfrom an effective medium perspective, which extends our previous work on\nelectromagnetic metamaterials to matter waves [12, 13]. The proposed theory may be\n\n-17-\n\n\finstrumental to establish novel analogies between electromagnetics and electronics, as\nfurther pursued in Ref. [24] in case of semiconductor superlattices. Here, we applied the\nformalism to the case of a graphene superlattice characterized by a 1D-periodic potential,\nshowing that the low energy excitations can be described in terms of an effective scalar\n\u02c6 \u02c6 + vr , yy yy\n\u02c6 \u02c6 . In particular, based on our\npotential and an anisotropy tensor vr = vr , xx xx\neffective medium model we predict a regime of perfect tunneling between nanomaterials\nwith symmetric values of the anisotropy ratio vr , yy / vr , xx and for a specific value of the\nelectron energy, completely analogous to Pendry's perfect lens in the context of\nelectromagnetic metamaterials.\nThis work is supported in part by the U.S. Air Force of Scientific Research (AFOSR)\ngrant numbers FA9550-08-1-0220 and FA9550-10-1-0408, and by Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a\nCi\u00eancia e a Tecnologia grant number PTDC/EEATEL/100245/2008.\n\nAppendix A: The effective Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nThe spatial averaging operator defined in the main text in the coordinate representation,\n\n{ }av , can more generally be described by the projection operator:\nO\u02c6 av =\n\nwhere\n\nB.Z.\n\nrepresents\n\n1\n\n( 2\u03c0 )\nthe\n\nN\n\n\u2211\n\u222b\n\u03c3\n\nk\u03c3 k\u03c3 d N k\n\nfirst\n\nBrillouin\n\n(A1)\n\nB.Z.\n\nzone,\n\nand\n\nthe\n\nnormalization\n\nk \u2032 | k = ( 2\u03c0 ) \u03b4 ( k \u2032 \u2212 k ) is implicit (here, k represents a state such that r | k = eik \u22c5r ).\nN\n\nThe label \u03c3 represents additional degrees of freedom of the wavefunction, such as the\n\n-18-\n\n\felectron spin and/or (in case of graphene) the pseudo-spin.

The Fourier transform of other state\nvectors or time dependent operators is defined similarly.\nWe denote the averaged state vector of the system as \u03c8 av ( t ) \u2261 O\u02c6 av \u03c8 ( t ) , and we define\n\n( H\u02c6\u03c8 )\nlinks\n\nav\n\n(t )\n\n( \u0124\u03c8 )\n\n\u2261 O\u02c6 av H\u02c6 \u03c8 ( t ) . Here, the objective is to find an effective Hamiltonian that\n\nav\n\n( )\n\n(t )\n\nand \u03c8 av ( t ) , in such a way that H\u02c6 ef (\u03c9 ) \u03c8 av (\u03c9 ) = H\u02c6 \u03c8\n\nav\n\n(\u03c9 )\n\nin\n\nthe frequency domain, when the initial state of the system is macroscopic, i.e. when\n\n\u03c8 t =0 = (\u03c8 t =0 )av .\nDenoting the propagator of the system by \u00db ( t ) , we can write:\n\n\u03c8 av ( t ) = O\u02c6 avU\u02c6 ( t ) \u03c8 t =0\n\n( H\u02c6\u03c8 )\n\n;\n\nav\n\n(t )\n\n= O\u02c6 av G\u02c6 ( t ) \u03c8 t =0\n\n(A3)\n\n\u02c6 \u02c6 . In the Fourier domain these relations are equivalent to:\nwhere G\u02c6 = HU\n\n\u03c8 av (\u03c9 ) = O\u02c6 avU\u02c6 (\u03c9 ) \u03c8 t =0\n\n( H\u02c6\u03c8 )\n\n;\n\nav\n\n(\u03c9 )\n\n= O\u02c6 av G\u02c6 (\u03c9 ) \u03c8 t =0\n\n(A4)\n\nIf the initial state is macroscopic, i.e. \u03c8 t =0 = (\u03c8 t =0 )av , it is evident that:\n\n\u03c8 av (\u03c9 ) = O\u02c6 avU\u02c6 (\u03c9 ) O\u02c6 av \u03c8 t =0\n\n-19-\n\n(A5)\n\n\fThe operator O\u02c6 avU\u02c6 (\u03c9 ) O\u02c6 av maps the subspace of \"macroscopic\" wavefunctions onto\nitself.

Thus, H\u02c6 ef (\u03c9 ) is the desired effective\nHamiltonian of the quantum system. It should be underlined that the above formula holds\nexactly, provided the initial state of the system (at t=0) is macroscopic.\nIf H\u02c6 ef ( t ) is the inverse Fourier transform of H\u02c6 ef (\u03c9 ) (with H\u02c6 ef ( t ) = 0 for t < 0 ), i.e. if\nH\u02c6 ef (\u03c9 ) =\n\n+\u221e\n\n\u222b dt H\u02c6 ( t ) e\nef\n\n+ i\u03c9 t\n\ndt ,\n\n(A7)\n\n0\n\nit is possible to write in the time domain\n\n( )\nH\u02c6 \u03c8\n\nt\n\nav\n\n( t ) = \u222b dt \u2032H\u02c6 ef ( t \u2212 t \u2032 ) \u03c8 av ( t \u2032) .\n\n(A8)\n\n0\n\nIt is worth mentioning that if the integration region in the right-hand side of Eq.

The role of \u00d4av in the definition of H\u02c6 ef is\nthus to \"smooth\" the exact \"microscopic\" Hamiltonian.\nSince\n\nthe\n\n\u0124 \u03c8 = ih\n\n\"microscopic\"\n\nwavefunction\n\nsatisfies\n\nthe\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger\n\nequation,\n\n\u2202\n\u03c8 , it is evident that provided the initial state (at t=0) is macroscopic, then\n\u2202t\n\naverage state vector \u03c8 av ( t ) satisfies exactly:\n\n-20-\n\n\ft\n\n\u222b dt \u2032H\u02c6 ( t \u2212 t \u2032) \u03c8 ( t \u2032)\nav\n\nef\n\n= ih\n\n0\n\n\u2202\n\u03c8 av ( t ) .\n\u2202t\n\n(A9)\n\nNotice that in this effective medium description the action of the Hamiltonian at time t\ndepends explicitly on the past history of the state vector, i.e. on the values of \u03c8 av ( t \u2032 ) for\nt \u2032 < t (note, however, that the past history can be traced back to the value of the wave\n\nfunction at time t = 0 , using Eq. (A9)). This intrinsic \"time dispersion\" in the response is\nthe price that is paid for the effective medium description of the system.\nNow that we have a formal definition for the effective Hamiltonian H\u02c6 ef (\u03c9 ) , we want to\nobtain its representation in the momentum space. To this end, we calculate,\nH ef ( k\u03c3 , k \u2032\u03c3 \u2032; \u03c9 ) = k\u03c3 | H\u02c6 ef (\u03c9 ) | k \u2032\u03c3 \u2032\n\n(A10)\n\n\u22121\n\nbeing H\u02c6 ef (\u03c9 ) = O\u02c6 avG\u02c6 (\u03c9 ) \u23a1\u23a3O\u02c6 avU\u02c6 (\u03c9 ) O\u02c6 av \u23a4\u23a6 O\u02c6 av . Now the key point is that because the\nquantum system is assumed invariant to translations along the basis vectors of the direct\nlattice, it follows that k\u03c3 | G\u02c6 (\u03c9 ) | qs and k\u03c3 | U\u02c6 (\u03c9 ) | qs vanish except if k \u2212 q is a\nprimitive vector of the reciprocal lattice. In particular, it is evident that O\u02c6 avU\u02c6 (\u03c9 ) O\u02c6 av\nmaps the state k\u03c3 into a state of the form\n\n\u2211c\n\ns\n\nks , and hence the inverse function has\n\ns\n\nthe same property. This implies that H\u02c6 ef (\u03c9 ) also maps the state k\u03c3 into a state of the\nform\n\n\u2211c\n\ns\n\nks , and thus it follows that:\n\ns\n\nH ef ( k\u03c3 , k \u2032\u03c3 \u2032; \u03c9 ) = h\u03c3 ,\u03c3 \u2032 ( k , \u03c9 )( 2\u03c0 ) \u03b4 ( k \u2212 k \u2032 )\nN\n\nwhere h\u03c3 ,\u03c3 \u2032 ( k , \u03c9 ) = \u222b\n\nd N k\u2032\n\n( 2\u03c0 )\n\nN\n\n(A11)\n\nk\u03c3 | H\u02c6 ef (\u03c9 ) | k \u2032\u03c3 \u2032 . In particular, this result implies that:\n\n-21-\n\n\fd N k\u2032 d N k\n\u02c6\nH ef (\u03c9 ) = \u2211 \u222b\nk\u03c3\nN\nN\n\u03c3 ,\u03c3 \u2032 ( 2\u03c0 ) ( 2\u03c0 )\n= \u2211\u222b\n\u03c3 ,\u03c3 \u2032\n\nd Nk\n\n( 2\u03c0 )\n\nN\n\nk\u03c3 | H\u02c6 ef (\u03c9 ) | k \u2032\u03c3 \u2032 k \u2032\u03c3 \u2032\n\n(A12)\n\nh\u03c3 ,\u03c3 \u2032 ( k , \u03c9 ) k\u03c3 k\u03c3 \u2032\n\nIt is worth noting that h\u03c3 ,\u03c3 \u2032 ( k , \u03c9 ) vanishes for k outside the Brillouin zone. The above\nformula gives the desired representation of H\u02c6 ef (\u03c9 ) in the momentum basis. Substituting\nthis result into Eq. (A6), it is found that,\n\n( )\n\nk\u03c3 | H\u02c6 \u03c8\n\nav\n\n= \u2211 h\u03c3 ,\u03c3 \u2032 ( k , \u03c9 ) k\u03c3 \u2032 | \u03c8 av (\u03c9 )\n\n(\u03c9 )\n\n(A13)\n\n\u03c3\u2032\n\ni.e. in the momentum coordinates the application of H\u02c6 ef (\u03c9 ) reduces to a simple matrix\nmultiplication.

The starting point is to note that\nthe Maxwell's equations in a continuous medium can be written as,\ni\u2207 \u00d7 \u239e\n\u239b 0\n\u2202g\n\u239c\n\u239ff = i\n\u2202t\n\u239d \u2212i\u2207 \u00d7 0 \u23a0\n\n(B1)\n\n\u239be\u239e\n\u239bd\u239e\nwith f = \u239c \u239f and g = \u239c \u239f . For standard isotropic non-dispersive magneto-dielectrics, the\n\u239dh\u23a0\n\u239db\u23a0\n\nelectric and magnetic fields, e and h , are linked to the electric displacement and\nmagnetic induction fields, d and b , by the standard constitutive relations g = M \u22c5 f with\n\u239b\u03b5 0 \u239e\nM=\u239c\n\u239f . For simplicity, in the following discussion we neglect material dispersion.\n\u239d0 \u03bc\u23a0\n\nIn a periodic metamaterial the permittivity and permeability are periodic functions of\nspace:\n\n\u03b5 = \u03b5 (r )\n\nand\n\n\u03bc = \u03bc ( r ) . Hence, the dynamics of the \"microscopic\"\n\nelectromagnetic fields (i.e. before any form of averaging on the scale of the unit cell of\nthe metamaterial) can be described by a Schr\u00f6dinger-type equation of the form\n\u0124\u03c8 = ih\n\n\u2202\n\u03c8 where \u03c8 \u2194 g is a six-component vector, and the operator \u0124 is given by:\n\u2202t\n\n-23-\n\n\fi\u2207 \u00d7 \u239e \u22121\n\u239b 0\nH\u02c6 = h \u239c\n\u239f\u22c5M .\n\u239d \u2212i\u2207 \u00d7 0 \u23a0\n\n(B2)\n\nObviously, the above Hamiltonian does not represent the energy of the system, but it is\nrather an operator that describes the dynamics of the classical electromagnetic field. For\nsimplicity, from now on in this Appendix we set h = 1 . It is interesting to notice that \u0124 is\nHermitian with respect to the inner product,\ng 2 | g1 =\n\n1 3 *\nd r g 2 \u22c5 M \u22121 ( r ) \u22c5 g1 ,\n\u222b\n2\n\n(B3)\n\nbeing implicit that the six-vector fields satisfy suitable (e.g. periodic) boundary\nconditions at the boundary of the integration region. We also note that g | g is the stored\nelectromagnetic energy.\nFor a given initial state of the electromagnetic field g t =0 , the unilateral Fourier transform\n+\u221e\n\nin time of g , defined by g% =\n\n\u222b ge\n\ni\u03c9t\n\ndt , satisfies:\n\n0\n\nH\u02c6 g% = \u03c9 g% \u2212 i g t =0\n\n(B4)\n\nThe above result implies that for initial macroscopic states of the form g t =0 = g 0 eik \u22c5r , with\n\n( )\n\ng 0 being an arbitrary constant vector, the macroscopic fields satisfy \u0124g%\n\nwhere G = g% av =\n\nav\n\n= \u03c9 G \u2212 ig 0 ,\n\n1\ng% e \u2212 ik \u22c5r d 3r represents the macroscopic electric displacement and\nVcell \u03a9\u222b\n\n\u239b D\u239e\nmacroscopic induction fields G = \u239c \u239f , H\u02c6 g%\n\u239dB\u23a0\n\n( )\n\nav\n\n-24-\n\n=\n\n1\nVcell\n\n\u222b ( H\u02c6 g% ) e\n\n\u03a9\n\n\u2212 ik \u22c5r\n\nd 3r , \u03a9 is the unit cell\n\n\fand Vcell is the corresponding volume. From the theory of the main text, the effective\nmedium operator H\u02c6 ef (\u03c9 , k ) is determined by imposing that for arbitrary g 0 one has:\n\n( )\n\nH\u02c6 ef G = H\u02c6 g%\n\nav\n\n.\n\n(B5)\n\nIt is easy to check from the definition of \u0124 that\n\n( H\u02c6 g% )\n\nav\n\n\u239b 0 \u2212k \u00d7 \u239e\n=\u239c\n\u239f\u22c5F\n0 \u23a0\n\u239dk \u00d7\n\n(B6)\n\n\u239bE\u239e\nwhere F = \u239c \u239f represents the macroscopic electric and magnetic fields, defined so that\n\u239dH\u23a0\nF=\n\n1\nVcell\n\n\u222b (M\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22c5 g% ) e\u2212 ik \u22c5r d 3r . Let the matrix M ef (\u03c9 , k ) be such that for arbitrary g 0 (i.e.\n\n\u03a9\n\nfor an arbitrary initial macroscopic state), one has:\nG = M ef (\u03c9 , k ) \u22c5 F .\n\n(B7)\n\nIt is easy to check that such a matrix exists and is uniquely defined, and the above\nequation is actually the basis of the homogenization approach of Refs [12, 13]. It is\nimportant to mention, as already discussed in Ref. [13], that defining M ef (\u03c9 , k ) such\nthat Eq. (B7) holds for an arbitrary initial macroscopic state, as considered here, is fully\nequivalent to define M ef (\u03c9 , k ) in such a way that Eq. (B7) holds for an arbitrary\nexternal macroscopic harmonic current excitation, which is the original framework of\nRef. [12].\nFrom Eq. (B5) and Eq. (B7), the effective medium operator can be expressed as:\n\u239b 0 \u2212k \u00d7 \u239e \u22121\nH\u02c6 ef = \u239c\n\u239f \u22c5 M ef (\u03c9 , k ) .\n0 \u23a0\n\u239dk \u00d7\n\n-25-\n\n(B8)\n\n\fThe matrix M ef (\u03c9 , k ) gives the effective medium parameters of the metamaterial, and is\nconsistent with the definition of Ref. [10]. In the particular case of a metamaterial formed\nby non-magnetic particles ( \u03bc = \u03bc0 ) it can be shown that M ef (\u03c9 , k ) assumes the simple\n\u239b\u03b5\nform M ef (\u03c9 , k ) = \u239c ef\n\u239c 0\n\u239d\n\n0\u239e\n\u239f where \u03b5 ef = \u03b5 ef (\u03c9 , k ) is the nonlocal effective dielectric\n\u03bc0 \u239f\u23a0\n\nfunction, defined exactly as in our previous works [12, 13]. This confirms that the theory\nof this work generalizes the previous studies [12, 13].\n\nAppendix C: The stationary states\nThe energy eigenstates of a microscopic Hamiltonian \u0124 (with \u0124 independent of time)\nare exactly the same as those of the corresponding homogenized system described by\nH\u02c6 ef , except for some possible degenerate cases that are discussed below. This result can\nbe proven by noting that the time evolution of the wavefunction for a given initial state\n\n\u03c8 t =0 is evidently \u03c8 ( t ) = \u2211 cn n e\n\n\u2212i\n\nEn\nt\nh\n\nwith cn = n | \u03c8 t =0 , with n , n=1,2,..., being\n\nn\n\nthe energy eigenstates of the microscopic system and En the corresponding eigenenergies. In particular it is evident that \u03c8 (\u03c9 ) , defined as in Eq. (A2) for Im \u03c9 > 0 , is\n\n\u03c8 (\u03c9 ) = \u2211 cn n\nn\n\n1\n, with \u03c9n = En / h . On the other hand, from the definition of\ni ( \u03c9n \u2212 \u03c9 )\n\nH\u02c6 ef (\u03c9 ) [see Eq. (A6)], we know that if \u03c8 t =0 is a macroscopic state, then\nO\u02c6 av H\u02c6 \u03c8 (\u03c9 ) = H\u02c6 ef (\u03c9 ) O\u02c6 av \u03c8 (\u03c9 )\nHence, this implies that:\n\n-26-\n\n(C1)\n\n\f\u2211c E\nn\n\nn\n\nnav\n\nn\n\n1\n1\n= \u2211 cn H\u02c6 ef (\u03c9 ) nav\ni ( \u03c9n \u2212 \u03c9 ) n\ni ( \u03c9n \u2212 \u03c9 )\n\n(C2)\n\nwhere we put nav = O\u02c6 av n . In order that to have an identity, it is necessary that the\nresidues of both sides of the equation calculated at a generic pole, \u03c9 = \u03c9n , are equal.\nHence, it follows that\nH\u02c6 ef (\u03c9n ) nav = En nav ,\n\nwith \u03c9n = En / h .\n\n(C3)\n\nThis confirms that the energy eigenstates of a microscopic Hamiltonian \u0124 , should be\nprecisely the same as those of the homogenized system. The eigenstates of the\nhomogenized system are evidently nav = O\u02c6 av n . Strictly speaking, some degenerate\ncases for which this property does not hold may occur. This may happen only if nav = 0 ,\ni.e. in case of microscopic states that have a trivial projection into the subspace of\nmacroscopic states. In such a case Eq. (C3) is equivalent to 0 = 0 and hence H\u02c6 ef (\u03c9n ) is\nnot required to have a non-trivial null space. In such circumstances the spectra of the\nmicroscopic and macroscopic Hamiltonians may not be exactly coincident at a few\nisolated points. The states for which nav = 0 , if there are any, cannot be excited with an\ninitial state \u03c8 t =0 that is macroscopic.\nIt is important to mention that the eigenstates of the homogenized system are not, in\ngeneral, mutually orthogonal with respect to the scalar product of the original Hilbert\nspace.\n\nIn\n\nfact,\n\nwe\n\nhave\n\nmav | nav = m | O\u02c6 av | n ,\n\nm | O\u02c6 av | n \u2260 m | n = \u03b4 m ,n . Moreover, if \u03c8 av ( t )\n\n-27-\n\nand\n\nin\n\ngeneral\n\nis solution of the macroscopic\n\n\fSchr\u00f6dinger equation [Eq. (A15)] (for a given initial time macroscopic state \u03c8 t =0 ), then\nin general \u03c8 av ( t ) | \u03c8 av ( t ) = \u03c8 ( t ) | O\u02c6 av | \u03c8 ( t ) may be different from \u03c8 ( t ) | \u03c8 ( t ) = 1 .\nIn other words, the standard normalization of the wavefunction does not apply to the\naveraged state vector.\n\nAppendix D: Electron tunneling through a nanomaterial with a\nnegative pseudospin\nHere, we describe the model used to compute the transmission coefficient when an\nelectron with energy E propagating on a graphene based nanomaterial with the energy\ndispersion E = + hvF k x2 + \u03c712 k y2\nnanomaterial\n\n(with\n\nthickness\n\n(conduction band), impinges on another graphene\nW\n\nalong\n\nx)\n\nwith\n\nthe\n\nenergy\n\ndispersion\n\nE = \u03b4 V \u2212 hvF k x2 + \u03c7 22 k y2 (valence band).

We are only\ninterested in the scattering of electrons with wave vector close to the Dirac K point.

The angle of incidence \u03b8i can be determined from the\nelectron velocity, v = \u2207 k E / h , and thus determines the transverse wave vector k y (e.g.\nfor pristine graphene k y = ( E / hvF ) sin \u03b8i ).
