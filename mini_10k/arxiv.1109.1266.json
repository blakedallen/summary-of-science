Optical spectra of classical T Tauri stars (cTTS) are rich in emission lines of low-excitation species that\nare composed of narrow and broad components, which indicates the existence of two emitting regions with different\nkinematics, densities, and temperatures. The photospheric spectrum is often veiled by an excess continuous emission.\nThis veiling is usually attributed to radiation from a heated region beneath the accretion shock. The broad emission\nlines of H i, He ii, Ca ii, Fe ii, and other species are thought to form in a larger volume of gas.\nAims. The aim of this research is to clarify the nature of the veiling, and whether the narrow chromospheric lines of\nFe i and other metals represent a standard chromosphere of a late-type star, or are induced by mass accretion.\nMethods. We carried out high-resolution spectroscopy of selected cTTS with a special focus on DR Tauri and followed\nvariations of chromospheric features, such as narrow Fe i emission lines, and accretion signatures such as the veiling\ncontinuum and the He ii line emission.\nResults. We found that the amount of veiling in DR Tau varies from practically nothing to factors more than 10 times\nthe stellar continuum intensity, and that the veiling is caused by both a non-photospheric continuum and chromospheric\nline emission filling in the photospheric absorption lines. The latter causes differential veiling because stronger lines are\nmore veiled. We developed methods to separate the two sources of veiling. Several veiled T Tauri stars show a common\neffect: the radial velocities of photospheric and chromospheric lines vary in anti-phase. This is caused by an area with\nenhanced chromospheric emission, which is offset from the pole of rotation and is associated with the hot spot formed\nat the footprint of the magnetic funnel of mass accretion.\nConclusions. The enhanced chromospheric emission in cTTS is linked not only to solar-like magnetic activity, but is\npowered to a greater extent by the accreting gas. We suggest that the area of enhanced chromospheric emission is\ninduced by mass accretion, which modifies the local structure of stellar atmosphere in an area that is more extended\nthan the hot accretion spot. The narrow emission lines from this extended area are responsible for the extra component\nin the veiling through line-filling of photospheric absorption lines.\nKey words. stars: pre-main sequence \u2013 stars: variables: T Tauri, Herbig Ae/Be \u2013 Accretion, accretion disks \u2013 stars:\nindividual: DR Tau, S CrA, RW Aur, RU Lup, DI Cep\n\n1. Introduction\nThe T Tauri stars are pre-main sequence stars of low mass.\nSpectroscopically they are characterized by emission lines\nsuperimposed on a photospheric spectrum of late type. In\nthe classical T Tauri stars (cTTS) the emission line spectrum is very rich and related to magnetospheric accretion\nfrom dusty disks. The T Tauri stars rotate faster than most\nlate-type main-sequence stars, and the enhanced emission\nin the weak-line stars, those not exhibiting evidence of accretion, is adequately explained in terms of enhanced solarlike magnetic activity. The same dynamo effect should be\npresent in the cTTS as well, but in addition enhanced line\nemission is generated in the accreting gas, which flows from\nthe circumstellar disk to the star, where it eventually heats\nup and releases energy in strong shocks at the stellar surface. Accordingly, the emission lines are much broader in\nSend offprint requests to: P. P.

For reviews of properties and models of\ncTTS see Petrov (2003) and Bouvier et al. (2007).\nIn cTTS the photospheric absorption lines are weakened\nby what is commonly attributed to an overlying continuous excess emission. The energy distribution of this veiling\nhas been matched with black body radiation at a temperature of \u223c 104 K, or alternatively with Paschen continuous\nemission (Basri & Batalha 1990; Hartigan et al. 1991, 1995;\nValenti et al. 1993; Calvet & Gullbring 1998; Gullbring et\nal. 1998). The veiling is attributed to radiation from \"hot\nspots\", small areas (sometimes rings) of heated gas at the\nfootprints of the accretion flows. T Tauri stars are photometrically variable, both from rotational modulation of\nsurface features and stochastic events (e.g., flares, changes\nin mass accretion rates). The changes in line intensities and\nprofiles in many cTTS are commonly attributed to variations in the accretion flow. The veiling levels can vary dramatically, and in the most active cTTS veiling may change\nfrom a tiny fraction of the intensity of the photospheric\ncontinuum to factors of several times this level. The degree\n\n\f2\n\nP. P. Petrov et al.: Accretion-powered chromospheres in classical T Tauri stars\n\nof veiling is commonly used to estimate accretion rates in\nCTTS.\nIntuitively, one would expect that when the veiling\nchanges, the stellar brightness would change accordingly.\nHowever, there had been several hints that this is not always the case. Gahm et al.(2008) demonstrated that in\nfour cTTS with very pronounced emission line spectra\nand strong irregular light variations, the veiling variations\nclearly did not follow this pattern. Substantial changes in\nthe veiling were accompanied by only minor changes in V\nand B, which in combination with an analysis of variations\nin equivalent widths of emission lines led the authors to conclude that veiling is not solely related to an excess continuum emission. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the\nphotospheric absorption lines are weakened due to fillingin by narrow, emission line components. While the above\nshows that the veiling effect is caused by at least two different processes, it is still unclear which mechanism causes\nthe appearance of these narrow emission features.\nIn order to investigate the origin of the narrow-lined\nchromospheric emission features, we performed a detailed\ninvestigation of the behavior of veiling in one of the most\nvariable cTTS, namely DR Tauri. Our observations show\nthis star to vary from a state of practically no veiling to\nlevels of more than 10 times the continuum flux. At high\nveiling levels narrow emission features are clearly present in\nthis object. In addition we find periodic variations in radial\nvelocity of both absorption lines as well as of the narrow\nemission components, which, as we will show in this paper,\nprovides indications on their origin.\nDR Tau is an unusually \"active\" cTTS, in the sense that\nthe emission line spectrum is exceedingly rich and variable,\nand that the photometric variations are large and primarily related to physical changes in the plasma surrounding\nthe star. There are many other well-known cTTS with similar properties, for which similar conclusions can be drawn\nregarding the nature of the veiling and the radial velocity\nfluctuations. We will illustrate this in the present paper by\ncomplementing our analysis with stars that show similar\nspectral line variations, namely RW Aur A, DI Cep, RU\nLup, and S CrA SE.\nDR Tau was for a long period a relatively faint star\nuntil in 1976 it rather suddenly brightened by several magnitudes in the blue (Chavarria-K. 1979), and the star is\nsometimes classified as an EXor star (see e.g. Lorenzetti et\nal. 2009). However, since that time it has stayed at this\nbright level but with dramatic and fairly irregular light\nvariations (Artemenko et al. 2010). Tentative photometric periods proposed by Richter et al. (1992), Bouvier et al.\n(1993), and Bouvier et al. (1995) differ by several days, and\nare different from a more recent determination by Percy et\nal. (2010), who assign a period of 5.0 days. This is also in\nthe same range of possible periods found from near-infrared\n(NIR) photometry by Kenyon et al. (1994), who relate the\nperiodicity of DR Tau to a hot spot on a rotating star with\na magnetic axis inclined to the stellar rotation axis.\nPronounced spectral variability in DR Tau was recognized early (Bertout et al. 1977; Krautter & Bastian 1980;\nMundt 1984; Aiad et al. 1984; Appenzeller et al. 1988).\nThe strong emission lines on occasion show inverse P Cygni\nstructures, which appear and disappear on time-scales as\nshort as a few hours (Smith et al. 1997, 1999). Basri &\nBatalha (1990) demonstrated that the veiling is large and\nvariable, and subsequent investigations of relations between\n\nvariations in emission lines and veiling led Guenther &\nHessman (1993) and Hessman & Guenther (1997) to conclude that in principle the observations were consistent with\nthe concept of magnetospheric accretion, with gas flowing\nalong dipole magnetic fields to a hot region on the visible surface. However, the data are inconsistent with constant accretion in a simple magnetic dipole, because irregular mass accretion and possible flare-line events distort the\nBalmer line profiles. In their long-term study of spectral\nvariablity in DR Tau, Alencar et al. (2001) were not able\nto recover any periodicity in the spectral changes. However,\nHessman & Guenther (1997) found evidence of a periodicity of 4.5\u20135 days in the equivalent widths of strong lines,\nand Johns & Basri (1995) reported a 5.1 day period in components in H\u03b1. Because these spectral periods are similar\nto some of the photometric periods presented above, one\nmay suspect that both phenomena are related to rotational\nmodulation, and that the period of rotation of DR Tau is\nin the range of 4.5\u20135 days.\nThe complex emission line profiles and their dramatic\nchanges can be better understood if the profiles are decomposed into different components arising from different emitting volumes around the star. The accreting gas produces\nBalmer line emission, sometimes with inverse P Cygni absorption components, and the broad metallic lines reflect\nthe bulk motion of this in-falling gas (see e.g. Muzerolle et\nal. 1998a, 1998b). Normal P Cygni absorption components\nare seen as well, indicating outflow in the form of massive\nwinds or jets. The P Cygni absorptions are particularly\ndistinct in some far-ultraviolet lines, like the Mg ii doublet\n(Kravtsova & Lamzin 1996, Ardila et al. 2002). The He i\nlines, particularly the NIR line at 10830 \u00c5, display absorption both from the in-falling and out-flowing gas as analysed in a series of papers by Beristain et al. (2001), Edwards\net al. (2003, 2006), Kwan et al. (2007) and Fischer et al.\n(2008). In all, DR Tau stands out as a cTTS with an unusually dynamic and very complex interplay between accreting\nand ejected gas.\nAs in many cTTS, the He lines in DR Tau display a\nnarrow emission component, which normally is attributed\nto post-shock gas at the footprints of the accretion flows\n(Lamzin et al.1996, Beristain et al. 1998). However, in\nDR Tau similar narrow components with a full-width halfmaximum (FWHM) of \u223c 20 km s\u22121 were also found in lines\nof Ca ii, Fe i and Fe ii (Batalha et al. 1996, Beristain et al.\n1998). In fact, Batalha et al. found a positive correlation\nbetween line strength and veiling and speculated that the\nnarrow component is related to a heated stellar atmosphere\nclose to the accretion zone \u2013 a \"hot chromosphere\".\nBelow we present our observations and reduction methods in Section 2. The methods of analysis and results\nare given in Section 3 and are discussed in more detail\nSection 4. Section 5 summarizes our results.\n\n2.

Data analysis and results\nWe start with a brief description of the spectra of DR Tau\nand the determination of the basic stellar parameters: temperature, gravity, radius, and rotation, and continue with\nan analysis of the veiling as a tracer of accretion, and radial\nvelocities of narrow emission lines as indicators of chromospheric surface inhomogeneities.\n3.1. General spectral properties\nWe present in Fig. 1 two typical segments of the DR Tau\nspectrum. Here, we averaged all 13 spectra to increase the\nsignal-to-noise ratio. For comparison we also show a spectrum of the template K7 star artificially veiled by a factor of\nfour, so that the strength of the photospheric lines become\nsimilar to those of DR Tau.\nThe main features in the spectrum of DR Tau are as\ndescribed by Beristain et al. (1998). The strongest emission\nis in the hydrogen Balmer lines and Ca ii H and K. Weaker\nemission is seen in neutral and singly ionised permitted\nlines of Fe i, Fe ii, He i, He ii, Ti ii, Na i and Ca i, and in\nforbidden [O i], [S ii], and [N ii].\nThe weakest emission lines are narrow (FWHM \u223c 20\nkm s\u22121 ), while stronger emission lines of metals exhibit a\ntwo-component structure: a similar narrow component as\n\nFig. 1. Segments of the averaged spectrum of DR Tau (solid\nline) as compared to the K7 V template HD 28343 (thin\nline) veiled artificially by a factor of four. In this and other\nfigures the wavelength scale is in the stellar rest frame.\n\nFig. 2. Emission line profiles with red-shifted absorption\ncomponents in the spectrum of DR Tau on HJD 2455192.\nLeft: H\u03b4, right: Fe ii 5018.43 \u00c5 (the narrow emission peak\non the blue wing is He i 5015.67 \u00c5).\n\nwell as a broad component with FWHM \u223c 100 km s\u22121 . The\nbroad component gradually grows stronger as the emission\nlines themselves become stronger, as is evident from the\npanels shown in Fig. 1. The stronger He i and Fe ii lines\n(for example Fe ii \u03bb 4924 and \u03bb 5018 \u00c5) show additional\nred-shifted absorption extending to +350 km s\u22121 . These\nsignatures of infall vary with time and are also present in\nthe higher Balmer lines as shown in Fig. 2. The profiles of\nH\u03b1 and other Balmer lines are split by deep broad absorption, centred at \u2212100 km s\u22121 , which indicates an outflow.\nTypical Balmer line profiles can be found in Alencar et al.\n(2001), where the Balmer emission was analysed in greater\ndepth.\nPhotospheric lines are detectable longward of \u223c 4500 \u00c5\nin the averaged spectrum, while during some nights with\nhigher veiling and/or lower signal-to-noise ratio many lines\nare not detectable. Nevertheless, in some spectral intervals\nthe photospheric lines are always visible, which makes it\npossible to follow night-to-night variations of the veiling.\nIn moments of high veiling some photospheric lines (e.g.\nFe i, multiplet 15) turn from absorption into pure emission.\n\n\f4\n\nP. P. Petrov et al.: Accretion-powered chromospheres in classical T Tauri stars\n\n3.2. Stellar parameters\nSpectral types assigned previously for DR Tau fall in a fairly\nnarrow range, from K5 to M0. The variable and often high\nveiling of the photospheric absorption lines makes it difficult to derive precise stellar parameters. However, we did\nobtain one spectrum of DR Tau in a relatively calm state\n(HJD = 2454104), which we will refer to as the low-veiling\nspectrum.\nThis low-veiling spectrum was compared to a grid of\nsynthetic spectra calculated for Teff = 3500, 3750, 4000,\n4250, and 4500 K with log g values of 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0. This\ngrid was calculated using the code by Berdyugina (1991)\nand Kurucz' models. Atomic line data were retrieved from\nthe VALD database (Kupka et al. 2000). The best fit was\nfound for Teff = 4000 \u2013 4250 K and log g = 3.5 \u2013 4.0. In\norder to check the spectral type with molecular features, we\nused the spectrum of HD 28343 (spectral type K7V) along\nwith M0V and K5V spectra collected earlier with FIES.\nThe spectrum of DR Tau is best matched with the K7V\nspectrum, as is illustrated in Fig. 3, where the template\nspectrum is artificially veiled by a factor of 1.0. The TiO\nbandhead at 7054 \u00c5 is also consistent with a spectral type\nof K7V for DR Tau, and we adopt Teff = 4100 \u00b1 200 K and\nlog g = 3.7 \u00b1 0.5 for the photosphere of DR Tau.\nIn Fig. 4 we compare the low-veiling spectrum of DR\nTau with a synthetic spectrum in the region of Ca i \u03bb\n6124 \u00c5. The synthetic spectrum was calculated for Teff =\n4100 K, log g = 3.7, vmic = 1.5 km s\u22121 , vmac = 1.5 km s\u22121\nand v sin i = 5 km s\u22121 , convolved with the instrumental\nprofile of FIES and veiled by factor of 1.3. The profiles\nof the V i, Ti i and Ba ii lines fit fairly well. A log g in the\nrange 3.5\u20134.0 gives a reasonably good fit to the broad wings\nof the Ca i line. The lines of Fe i are partly filled in with\nchromospheric emission (see below).\nThe projected rotational velocity v sin i = 5 \u00b1 1 km s\u22121\nwas found from the widths of many metal lines as fitted\nwith the synthetic spectrum in the region 5580\u20136150 \u00c5.\nNote that v sin i is somewhat less than the FWHM of the\ninstrumental profile (\u22486.5 km s\u22121 ). Nevertheless, the high\nsignal-to-noise ratio in our spectra enables us to detect this\nlow value of the rotational broadening of photospheric lines.\nAssuming that at minimum brightness the photosphere\nis less affected by accretion, we can estimate the stellar luminosity and radius. From an extended set of photometric\ndata from 1986\u20132003 (Grankin et al. 2007), Vmin = 13.m 0 \u00b1\n0.m 30 and the corresponding colour V \u2212 R = 1.m 40 \u00b1 0.m 08,\nwhich gives AV = 0.m 93 \u00b1 0.m 30. From the corresponding\nminimum B \u2212 V colours we find a faintest B magnitude\nthat is similar to what DR Tau had in the first half of the\n20th century (Chavarria-K. 1979). Hence, there is no indication that the stellar parameters have changed following the\ngeneral increase in brightness around 1976. The circumstellar component of the extinction is probably small because\nthe star is seen close to pole-on (see also the discussion in\nSect. 3.3.2). With a distance to DR Tau of d = 140 pc (e.g.\nBertout & Genova 2006) we obtain the following stellar\nparameters: L = 0.52 \u00b1 0.15 L\u2299 and R = 1.46 \u00b1 0.20 R\u2299.\nEarlier published estimates of the radius range from 1.2 R\u2299\n(Bertout & Basri 1988) to 2.7 R\u2299 (Johns-Krull & Gafford\n2002).\nRegarding other programme stars, the primary and secondary of S CrA have earlier been classified as G5 Ve and\nK5 Ve, respectively (Carmona et al. 2007). However, our\n\nFig. 3. Molecular TiO band at 7054 \u00c5. Upper: the lowveiling spectrum of DR Tau. Lower: the spectrum of\nHD 28343, (K7 V), artificially veiled by a factor of 1.0.\n\nFig. 4.

Elements and lower\nlevel excitation potentials (eV) are indicated.\nlong-slit UVES/VLT spectra yield very similar parameters\nfor the two components, namely Teff = 4250 \u00b1 150 K, log g\n= 4.0 \u00b1 0.2 and v sin i = 12 \u00b1 1 km s\u22121 . Furthermore, RW\nAur A has a spectral type of K1\u2013K4, v sin i \u2248 20 km s\u22121\n(Petrov et al. 2001); RU Lup has Teff = 3950 \u00b1 200 K,\nlog g = 3.9 \u00b1 0.3, and v sin i = 9.0 \u00b1 0.9 km s\u22121 (Stempels\n& Piskunov 2002), and DI Cep has spectral type G8 and\nv sin i = 20.0 \u00b1 1.5 km s\u22121 (Gameiro et al. 2006).\n3.3. Two sources of veiling\nAs discussed early by e.g. Bertout (1984), the photospheric\nspectrum of a cTTS can be veiled by 1) an additional nonphotospheric excess continuum and 2) line emission filling\nin photospheric absorption lines.\n3.3.1. Traditional veiling measurements\nTraditionally, the veiling factor (VF) is determined from the\nequivalent width (EW) of a photospheric line measured in\nthe spectrum of DR Tau and in a template (e.g. synthetic)\nspectrum:\nVF = EWsynt /EWDR \u2212 1.\nFrom measurements of numerous photospheric absorptions in the average spectrum of DR Tau no significant correlation was found either in veiling versus wavelength, or in\nveiling versus excitation potential of different lines, within\nthe wavelength range 4500\u20136800 \u00c5 and excitation potential\nrange 0\u20135 eV. Although it is commonly accepted that veiling increases towards the blue, the wavelength dependence\n\n\fP. P. Petrov et al.: Accretion-powered chromospheres in classical T Tauri stars\n\nFig. 5. Ratio of EWs in the K7V template and DR Tau.\nOpen circles: low-veiling spectrum, filled circles: average\nspectrum. The horizontal dashed line marks the case of\nzero veiling.\nis not always well defined because of the large scatter in\nthe veiling factors derived from different spectral lines (e.g.\nBasri & Batalha, 1990). In Fig. 5 we show the ratio of EWs\nas measured in the spectra of the K7V template and DR\nTau as a function of wavelength. Each symbol represents\none spectral line. Note that the large scatter of points is\ncaused not only by errors of measurements of EWs, but\nalso by the dependence of veiling on line strength (see below).\nNot all absorption lines that are visible in the averaged\nspectrum can be detected in individual spectra. We therefore carefully selected spectral regions where photospheric\nlines are clearly visible in all spectra of DR Tau, even in\nthose with high veiling, and which never turn into emission:\n5580\u20135605 \u00c5 (six lines of Ca i), 6000\u20136040 \u00c5 (four lines of\nMn i and Fe i), 6110\u20136160 \u00c5 (five lines of V i, Ti i, Ba ii,\nNa i) and 6460\u20136480 \u00c5 (two lines of Ca i). In these regions\nwe measured the corresponding values of the VF in each\nspectrum of DR Tau using the K7V template. Fig. 6 shows\nthe night-to-night variations of the veiling. The VF at 6110\u2013\n6160\u00c5 and its standard deviation are also given in the last\ntwo columns in Table 1.\n3.3.2. Distinguising the excess continuum from\nchromospheric line emission\nUnfortunately, the veiling measurements we perform above\ncannot discriminate between the effect of a veiling continuum and the effect of chromospheric line emission fillingin the photospheric lines. We therefore used the following\nthree methods to separate and quantify these two effects.\nThe first method is based on measurements of the forbidden lines and is similar to the method used by Gahm et\nal. (2008). Forbidden emission lines of [O i] at 5777.3, 6300.2\nand 6363.8 \u00c5 and [S ii] at 6717.0 and 6731.3 \u00c5 are usually present in spectra of cTTS. These forbidden lines are\nformed in a large volume extending far away from the star,\nas compared to permitted emission lines, and can therefore\nbe expected to be intrinsically stable on a time scale of days.\nHence, the observed night-to-night variations of EWs of the\nforbidden lines are mainly caused by continuum variations.\nFig. 7 shows that there is a strong correlation between\nEWs of photospheric absorption lines and forbidden lines of\n[O i]. The existence of this correlation indicates that both\nthe photospheric and the [O i] lines are affected by the continuous veiling component. However, the range of variabil-\n\n5\n\nFig. 6. Night-to-night variations of the veiling factor in DR\nTau. Filled circles: spectral region 6000\u20136040 \u00c5 (lines of\nMn i and Fe i). Open circles: spectral region 6110\u20136160 \u00c5\n(lines of V i, Ti i, Ba ii, Na i)\n\nFig. 7. Correlated variations of EWs of forbidden emission\nlines (sum of [O i] \u03bb 5577, \u03bb 6300 and \u03bb 6363 \u00c5) and photospheric lines (sum of 17 lines within 5580\u20136500 \u00c5). Dashed\nline shows relation expected in case of only continuum variations.\nity for the photospheric lines is twice as large as for the\n[O i] lines: the EWs of [O i] lines change by a factor of 2.7,\nwhile the EWs of photospheric lines change by a factor of of\n5.3. This means that another source of veiling contributes\nas much as the continuum veiling component.\nThe second method is based on the effect of differential\nveiling. Here, we measured from the average spectrum of\nDR Tau EWs of about 90 photospheric lines of different\nelements in the spectral region 5580\u20136720 \u00c5. We then measured the same lines in the template spectrum. For each\nspectral line we calculated the ratio of EWs in DR Tau\nand in the template spectrum. Identical measurements were\nperformed on the low-veiling spectrum of DR Tau.\nIf the veiling were only caused by a featureless continuous veiling component, all lines would be reduced by\nthe same factor. However, the ratio of EWs depends on\nline strength: stronger lines are veiled more (see Fig. 8).\nThe effect as such has been recognized before (e.g. Basri\n& Batalha 1990 and references therein) but is here demonstrated in a graphical form. We obtained the same result\nwhen we used a synthetic template spectrum instead of the\nK7V data, and the effect of the differential veiling persists\nwhen temperature and gravity of the template vary within\nprobable errors in Teff (\u00b1 200 K) and log g (\u00b1 0.5). Note\nthat the scatter of points in Fig. 8 is solely owing to uncertainties in the EW measurements from the spectra of\n\n\f6\n\nP. P.

The 99% confidence intervals are outlined by dashed curves. The scatter of points\naround the regression lines is caused by errors of measurements of EWs. The horizontal dashed line corresponds to\nzero veiling.\n\nDR Tau and the template. From the weakest lines (EW \u2264\n0.05 \u00c5) in Fig. 8 we estimate VF \u223c 0\u20130.5 for the low-veiling\nspectrum, and VF \u223c 3\u20134 for the averaged spectrum. These\nnumbers represent upper levels of the veiling continuum in\nthe two spectra. The increasing excess of veiling towards\nstronger lines (EW > 0.1 \u00c5) should be attributed to chromospheric line emission. The VF values given in Table 1\nand shown in Fig. 6 are derived from relatively strong photospheric lines (EW \u2248 0.1 \u00c5 in the K7V template), because\nweaker lines are not always measurable in the individual\nspectra of DR Tau.\nThe third method uses the colourimetric characteristic\nof a star with a hot spot (Petrov & Kozack 2007). According\nto standard magnetospheric accretion models the continuum veiling originates from the emission of a hot spot located below the accretion stream. The expected effective\ntemperature of the hot spot is 6000\u20138000 K with a filling\nfactor within 0.1\u20131 % of the stellar surface area (Calvet &\nGullbring 1998). It is believed that stochastic events of accretion cause the irregular night-to-night variability of the\nbrightness and colours of cTTS.\nThe expected colours of a K7 star with a hot photospheric spot can be calculated as a function of spot size\nand temperature. These two parameters define the veiling\nfactor VF, and hence the calculated colours. This means\nthat, for instance, changes in B \u2212 V and V \u2212 R are directly related to the degree of veiling. In order to analyse\nthe colour changes in DR Tau we made use of the photometric catalogue by Grankin et al. (2007), which includes\nabout 20 years of observations of TTS. For DR Tau there\nare over 600 observations in 18 seasons from 1986 to 2003.\n\nThe left panel of Fig. 9 shows colour-colour diagrams\nwith the main sequence from A0 to M6, as well as the observed colours of DR Tau. The two solid bow-shaped curves\nare sequences of the \"star+spot\" colours, corresponding to\ntwo different colour temperatures of the hot spot, approximately those of F0 and A0 stars. Along these curves, the\nspot radius varies, thus changing the filling factor and, correspondingly, the veiling factor VF. The loci of VF = 1, 2,\nand 4 are marked in the figure. The observed colours deviate from the model grids, but corrections for interstellar\nreddening must be made.\nThe right panel of Fig. 9 shows the same diagram with\nthe colours of DR Tau corrected for an interstellar reddening AV = 1.m 0. This correction brings the cluster of points\nto the sequence of the \"star + spot\" colours. The cluster of\npoints is centred at the position of VF \u2248 1.0, with a spread\nfrom VF = 0.5 to VF = 2. Some scatter towards bluer BV colours (about 0.m 2) may be caused by contribution of\nemission lines to the B pass band.\nApparently, the hot region is permanently present on\nthe visible surface of the star, but does not contribute to\nthe veiling by more than VF \u2248 2.0. This corresponds to a\nbrightness variability in the V band within \u2248 1m .2. Because\nthe observed veiling of DR Tau reaches much larger values, typically 3 to 10, the rest of the veiling effect must be\ncaused by the line emission filling-in the photospheric lines.\nGenerally, if the effect of the line emission reduces the photospheric line depth by a factor of VFline and, in addition,\nthe non-photospheric continuum reduces the line depth by\na factor of VFcont , the resulting veiling VF is defined by\nthe relation\n(VF + 1) = (VFline + 1) * (VFcont + 1).\nThis is a steep relation. For instance, with VFline =\nVFcont = 2.0, the resulting veiling is VF = 8. This explains\nthe extremely high veiling (VF > 10) observed sometimes\nin spectra of cTTS. It also means that the accretion rate derived on the assumption that the observed veiling is caused\nby an additional continuum may be overestimated by a considerable factor, as was also concluded earlier by Gahm et\nal. (2008) for other cTTS.\nNote that the temperature used in this method is a\ncolour temperature in the spectral range covering the BVR\n\n\fP. P.

Anti-phase RV-variations of photospheric (filled\ncircles) and chromospheric (open circles) lines in DR Tau.\n\npass bands, and may differ from the effective temperature.\nThe continuum radiation from a hot spot on a cTTS is\ncomposed of an optically thick continuum from the heated\nphotosphere and an optically thin Paschen continuum from\nthe pre- and post-shocked gas (Gullbring et al. 2000).\nWe conclude that all three methods described above\nshow that the veiling continuum in DR Tau is relatively\nsmall compared to the values derived directly from measurements of EWs of the photospheric lines, indicating that\nthe excess of the observed veiling is caused by the chromospheric line emission.\n3.4. Anti-phase radial velocity variations\nStellar radial velocity (RV), as measured from positions of\nphotospheric lines, can vary on time scales of days either because of orbital motions in a close binary system or because\nof surface brightness inhomogeneities (cool/hot spots). In\nthe latter case variations in RV must be within the observed\nv sin i value.\nStellar RVs of DR Tau were measured by crosscorrelation with the spectrum of the template HD 28343\nin the region 5560\u20136670 \u00c5, with the emission lines masked\nout. The radial velocity of the template was determined by\ncross-correlation with the synthetic spectrum (Teff = 4000\nK, log g = 4.5) resulting in RV = \u221235.20 \u00b1 0.04 km s\u22121 .\nThe results of the RV measurements are given in Table 2.\nWe then selected a group of unblended emission lines\nof the Fe i multiplet 15, within 5371\u20135456 \u00c5, as representative of the chromospheric emission (most lines are present\nin Fig. 1). The profile of each line was decomposed into a\nbroad and narrow component, and the position of the narrow component was determined by a Gaussian fit. The average RVs of the Fe i emission lines are also given in Table 2.\nThe two blanks in the column of RVem correspond to dates\nwhen the star was at a state of low veiling and the Fe i emission was too weak to be used for RV measurements. The\nRVs show night-to-night variations with a semi-amplitude\nof about 1 km s\u22121 for both the photospheric and the emission lines, which is well within the v sin i value. The main\nresult is that the RV variations of the photospheric lines and\nof the narrow component of the Fe i emissions are in antiphase (see Fig. 10). Similar variations were first reported\nfor RW Aur by Petrov et al. (2001).\nThe broad components show periodic shifts in central\nvelocity with time. However, the measurement accuracy of\nthe position of a broad component using a Gaussian fit is\n\nFig. 11. Anti-phase RV-variations of photospheric (filled\ncircles) and chromospheric (open circles) lines in four cTTS.\nNarrow emission lines of Fe i were measured in RW Aur and\nS CrA SE, and of He i in RU Lup and DI Cep. Note the\npositive shift in velocity of the He i emission.\nmuch lower than for the narrow components. The RV amplitudes of broad components were measured by means of\ncross-correlation of each spectrum with the average spectrum of DR Tau with the narrow components masked out.\nThe amplitudes of the broad components turned out to be\nlarger than those of the narrow components, which is consistent with an origin of the broad components well above\nthe stellar surface.\nTable 3 summarises measurements of RVs in different\ngroups of lines, which are arranged in order of increasing\nRV amplitude. The mean stellar velocity is +23 km s\u22121 .\nNote that the mean RV is more positive for the \"hightemperature\" lines, up to +36 km s\u22121 for the narrow He ii\ncomponent.\nOur search for radial velocity changes was then extended to the other cTTS included in the present study. As\nshown in Fig. 11, all programme stars show the same type of\nanti-phase variations as observed for DR Tau. Furthermore,\nnarrow emission lines from ions like He i formed at higher\ntemperatures are also red-shifted by several km s\u22121 with\nrespect to the stellar velocity. Therefore these phenomena,\nindicating infall to regions at the stellar surface that are offset relative to the rotational axis, appear to be a universal\nproperty of active cTTS.\n\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Modelling the RV variations\nCross-correlation of DR Tau spectra with the synthetic\nspectrum in the region 6000\u20136040 \u00c5 reveals that the bissector of cross-correlation function (as described in Dall et\nal. 2006) correlates with the stellar radial velocity. This\nexcludes the case of a binary motion and suggests that RV\n\n\f8\n\nP. P. Petrov et al.: Accretion-powered chromospheres in classical T Tauri stars\n\nTable 2.

The same effect was found earlier for RU Lup by\nStempels et al. (2007).\nThe anti-phase RV variations of the photospheric and\nemission lines suggest that the line emission is confined to a\ncertain area on the stellar surface, which is not aligned with\nthe axis of rotation, resulting in periodic shifts in RV as the\nstar rotates. The velocity curves in Fig. 10 have minima\nand maxima separated by about 4.5 days, which is similar\nto the photometric and spectroscopic periods (4.5\u20135.0 days)\nreported above, and which have been linked to rotational\nmodulation.\nThe effect of an \"emission spot\" resulting in the antiphase RV variations can be illustrated with a simple model.\nWe generated synthetic spectra of a single rotating star plus\nan area emitting the narrow emission lines under the assumption that this area has the form of a circular spot. The\ninput parameters for the model are: projected rotational velocity (v sin i), inclination (i) of the stellar rotational axis to\nthe line of sight, spot latitude (\u03c6), spot radius (rspot ), local\nspectra of the photosphere and the chromospheric spot, and\nthe limb darkening coefficient (\u03bc). The spectrum was integrated over the visible stellar surface at different phases of\nstellar rotation. We then determined the radial velocities of\nthe photospheric lines RVphot and the emission lines RVem\nas a function of phase.\nIn this model most of the input parameters are restricted by observations. From v sin i = 5 \u00b1 1 km s\u22121 , rotational period 4.5\u20135.0 days and R\u2217 = 1.46 R\u2299 , we obtain\nthe inclination angle i = 20\u25e6 \u00b1 4\u25e6 , i. e. the star is seen\nclose to pole-on. The inclination is not very sensitive to the\n\nMean RV\n(km s\u22121 )\n23.0 \u00b10.2\n22.5 \u00b1 0.2\n23.4 \u00b1 0.3\n26.9 \u00b1 0.9\n36.1 \u00b1 0.5\n24.3 \u00b1 1.0\n22.9 \u00b1 1.0\n\nSemi-amplitude\n(km s\u22121 )\n1.1 \u00b10.2\n1.1 \u00b1 0.2\n1.5 \u00b1 0.2\n1.1 \u00b1 0.3\n2.5 \u00b1 0.7\n5.0 \u00b11.5\n8 \u00b12\n\nTable 4.

With\nv sin i = 5.0 \u00b1 1.0 km s\u22121 and \u2206RV= 1.15 \u00b1 0.20 km s\u22121 we\nget \u03c6 = 76\u25e6 \u00b1 4\u25e6 .\nA synthetic spectrum with Teff = 4100 K and log g = 3.7\nwas taken as the local spectrum of the undisturbed photosphere surrounding the spot. Within the spot area the local\nspectrum was assumed to be a sum of the photospheric\nspectrum and a line emision spectrum with similar line\nwidths and line ratios. The overall emission line strength\nwas a free parameter. The limb darkening coefficient was\ntaken as \u03bc = 0.8 (Al-Naimi 1978). Table 4 summarises the\nmodel parameters.\n\n\fP. P.

Dashed profile: a normal photosphere without spot;\nright \u2013 RV-variations of absorption lines (open circles) and\nemission lines (filled circle).\nAs shown in Fig. 12 the model can reproduce the observed anti-phase RV-variations very well. The emission line\nstrengths were tuned to obtain the best fit to the observed\nRV amplitudes. Equal RV amplitudes of emission and absorption lines occur when the latter is about halfway filled\nwith emission (i.e. VFline \u2248 1). A spot radius of rspot = 14\u25e6\n(filling factor = 0.015) adopted in this model is about the\nsame as the typical radius of the accretion stream in the\n3-D simulations of magnetospheric accretion by Romanova\net al. (2003). The model also reproduces the redshifted velocity offset of the He lines, provided that this emission\nis formed in infalling gas, with a velocity vector directed\ntowards the star.\nIn some other cTTS, the Zeeman-Doppler imaging technique has been used to reconstruct the large-scale magnetic\ntopology and to outline Ca ii line emission from the shocked\ngas near the stellar surface: V2129 Oph (Donati et al. 2007\nand 2011), BP Tau (Donati et al. 2008), CV Cha and CR\nCha (Hussain et al. 2009), and AA Tau (Donati et al. 2010).\nWhile the recovered structures are sometimes complex, it\nis not uncommon to see hot spots, as indicated by the enhanced Ca ii emission. The adopted size and derived location relative to the rotational axis for our Fe i emitting area\nin DR Tau resembles the spots of Ca ii emission found in\nV2129 Oph and BP Tau.\nIt is worthwhile to note that the distortions of a photospheric line profile caused by an emission core (Fig. 12) are\nvery similar to those caused by a dark spot. The two effects\ncan be distinguished with the help of photometry made simultaneously with spectropolarimetry. Although we cannot discard a contribution from cool spots in the observed\nRV-variations of photospheric lines in DR Tau, both the\ndifferential veiling and the anti-phase RV-variations indi-\n\ncate that these are primarily caused by line emission. The\npresence of narrow emission lines inside photospheric lines\nis particularly evident in S CrA SE (Gahm et al. 2008).\n4.2. Accretion powered emission\nA direct signature of infall are the inverse P Cyg (IPC) absorption components. In our series of spectra of DR Tau,\nIPC are present in the strongest Fe ii lines (multiplet 42),\nin the Na i D lines, in the higher Balmer lines and, less evident, in the He i line at 5876 \u00c5 (Fig. 2). In the low-veiling\nspectrum most emission lines have faded out, and only the\nstrongest emission lines are present. On this occasion the\nIPC profiles have also disappeared. During this episode of\nrelatively weak accretion both the veiling continuum and\nthe chromospheric emission are considerably reduced. The\nupper limit to the veiling continuum that day was only \u223c\n0.5, as is evident from Fig. 8. The area of enhanced chromospheric emission in DR Tau is permanently present, but\nvaries in strength, and is probably coupled to a variable\namount of mass accretion.\nWe can roughly estimate the expected accretion luminosity for the low-veiling spectrum using the relation between H\u03b1 emission line flux and accretion luminosity by\nFang et al. (2009). Our spectra are not flux-calibrated,\nbut for the low-veiling spectrum we can assume that DR\nTau was close to its minimum brightness (see Sect. 3.2).\nIn the low-veiling spectrum, EW (H\u03b1) = 83.5 \u00c5. For a\nK7V star with L\u2217 = 0.5 L\u2299 , this EW corresponds to\nlog(LH\u03b1 /L\u2299 ) = \u22122.53. Using the relation by Fang et\nal. (2009), we obtain log(Laccr /L\u2299 ) = \u22120.89 \u00b1 0.25, or\nLaccr /L\u2217 \u2248 0.26, which is compatible with an observed\nveiling < 0.5 in the V band.\nTo explore further whether the narrow Fe i emission is\nrelated to the hot accretion spot, we followed radial velocity\nvariations of the He ii \u03bb 4686 \u00c5 emission. In standard dipole\nmagnetospheric accretion models He is ionised by the X-ray\nradiation from the shock. Fig. 13 shows that the RV of the\nnarrow Fe i emission lines vary in phase with the narrow\nHe ii emission line. This strongly suggests that the area of\nchromospheric emission is located close to the hot region at\nthe footprint of the accretion stream (see also discussions\nby Batalha et al. 1996 and Beristain et al. 1998). Moreover,\nthe He ii line is clearly red-shifted relative to other narrow lines. As discussed by e.g. Lamzin (1998), these \"hightemperature\" lines are formed in the post-shock region.\n\n\f10\n\nP. P. Petrov et al.: Accretion-powered chromospheres in classical T Tauri stars\n\nOur observations thus demonstrate that there is a\nclose relation between the appearance of enhanced chromospheric emission and accretion in classical T Tauri stars.\nThe narrow emission lines of e.g. Fe i appears over an area\nat the stellar surface that is associated with the footprints\nof the magnetic funnels, and that is offset from the pole of\nrotation.\nIn standard dipole magnetospheric models the accretion\nspot may take the form of a ring, which becomes distorted\nwhen the magnetic and rotational axes are not aligned.\nHowever, recent models assume much more complex magnetic field configurations (e.g. Mohanty & Shu 2008). The\n3-D simulations of magnetically channelled accretion by e.g.\nRomanova et al. (2004, 2011) and Long et al. (2011) reflect\nthe complex magnetic structures found from Doppler imaging of TTS.\nIn the general concept of magnetically channeled accretion, the accretion spot on a cTTS determines the observed\nbrightness of the star, the veiling of photospheric lines and\nthe strength of certain emission lines, and all three parameters must vary in correlation. However, observations do\nnot always support this prediction (see e.g. Petrov et al.,\n2001). In order to resolve this discrepancy, we suggest that\nthe area of enhanced chromospheric emission is much more\nextended than the size of the hot accretion spot. In the\nmodels by Romanova et al., less dense and non-uniform\ngas surrounds the main accretion stream and falls onto a\nmuch larger area than what is covered by the main stream,\nup to 16% of the stellar surface. A possibility is that our\nobserved enhanced chromospheric emission is excited by\nsuch a milder accretion flow and therefore distributed over\na similar area surrounding the smaller hot spot. One can\nassume that the accompanying shocks and related phenomena are less pronounced than at the main footprints, and\nthat little or no continuous excess emission is released. In\nthis scenario, a tight correlation between the brightness,\nveiling and emission line strength is not expected.\nX-ray observations of cTTS show that besides very powerful coronal emission there is as a rule one component of\nsoft X-rays that can be associated with the hot spot (see\ne.g. G\u00fcdel & Telleschi 2007 and Argiroffi et al. 2009 and\nreferences therein). Recently, Brickhouse et al. (2010) presented X-ray spectroscopy of the cTTS TW Hya. A lowtemperature component (T \u223c 2.5 MK) could be identified\nwith the accretion shock, as depicted in the standard accretion models, and a high-temperature component was ascribed to coronal emission at T \u223c 10 MK. In addition,\nthe authors discuss a third component, represented by lowdensity lines of e.g. O vii formed at T \u223c 1.75 MK, which fills\na great volume outside the post-shock region. Brickhouse\net al. speculate that violent mass outflows and shocks may\npropagate from the base of the accretion shock (see also\nOrlando et al. 2010), and that the photospheric surroundings are heated, which supplies ionised gas to accretion-fed\nmagnetic structures, such as magnetic loops. In addition,\none can expect that the surface layers surrounding the hot\nspot are excited by UV-light directly from the hot spot.\nRegardless of the dominating cause of the enhanced\nchromospheric emission one would expect that the atmospheric structure adjacent to the hot spot is affected. In\nsome early attempts to explain line emission and veiling in\ncTTS, Herbig (1970) and Cram (1979, 1980) introduced the\nconcept of a \"deep chromosphere\", where the temperature\nminimum occurs at deeper layers in the atmosphere, thus\n\nresulting in the appearence of stronger emisson spectrum.\nWe speculate that our area of enhanced emission surrounding the hot spot could be similar to a deep chromosphere\nwith a temperature minimum much deeper in the atmosphere than in a normal dwarf, but still above the photospheric continuum. In any case, the chromospheric emission\nin cTTS appears to be related not only to solar-like magnetic activity, but is to a considerable extent powered by\naccretion processes.\n\n5. Conclusions\nWe have studied periodic changes in photospheric lines and\nnarrow components of emission lines in DR Tauri and other\nclassical T Tauri stars, and investigated the nature of the\ndilution of photospheric lines, the so-called veiling. In particular we note:\n\u2013 In the course of our observations the amount of veiling\nin DR Tau varies from practically nothing to factors\nof more than 10 times the stellar continuum intensity.\nWe have developed three methods to distinguish the\ncontribution from line emission and continuous excess\nemission to the veiling. We conclude that narrow emission lines fill in the photospheric absorption lines, and\nthat this effect is more pronounced when the veiling\nis strong. Therefore, estimates of mass accretion rates\nbased on the assumption of a continuous veiling will be\noverestimated for cTTS with strong emission line spectra.\n\u2013 Radial velocities of photospheric and narrow chromospheric lines vary in anti-phase in all cTTS studied here.\nThe mean velocity of the narrow lines are at rest relative to the stellar radial velocity. The velocity amplitudes are small. We have modelled these variations and\ninfer that the emission lines are formed in an area at\nthe stellar surface that is offset from the rotational axis.\nThese properties appears to be a common phenomenon\nin cTTS.\n\u2013 The narrow emission line of He ii \u03bb 4686 \u00c5 in DR Tau\nvaries in phase with the narrow chromospheric components, but is systematically red-shifted by \u223c 10 km s\u22121 ,\nwhich is consistent with the origin of this line in decelerated post-shock gas. We conclude that the area of\nenhanced chromospheric emission is directly related to\nthe hot spot area, and that chromospheric emission is induced by accretion. In accordance with this, we demonstrate that a sudden disappearance of inverse P Cygni\nprofles in strong lines coincided with a fading of both\nthe veiling and the strength of chromospheric lines.\nWe suggest that the area of enhanced chromospheric\nemission comes from an extended region at the stellar surface surrounding the hot spot. The physical mechanism that\ntriggers the emission can be related to current ideas that\ndiffer from the standard model in that accretion is more\nwide-spread, or emanates from injection of mass and energy\nfrom the shocked region under the main accretion stream.\nAs a result the photosphere surrounding the hot spot is\nheated, which leads to a modified atmospheric structure,\nwhich in turn produces the enhanced emission in narrow\nemission lines responsible for the extra component in the\nveiling through line-filling of photospheric absorption lines.\n\n\fP.
