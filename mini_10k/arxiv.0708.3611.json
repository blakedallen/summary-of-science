Protonated\nwater clusters are perhaps one of the most abundant of these species in the stratosphere and\ncan host a large variety of chemical processes; most notably are those controlling atmospheric\nnucleation. For example, Yang et al.5 have analyzed the importance of these aggregates in\nthe earliest stages of the formation of noctilucent clouds at high altitudes, at temperatures\nas low as 150 K. From a more fundamental perspective, the analysis of the equilibrium\nand dynamical characteristics of chemical reactivity in these clusters continues to draw\nconsiderable attention from experimental and theoretical perspectives.6 One of the reasons\nfor this interest is the fact that, by a careful control of the cluster sizes, one can bridge\nthe gap between analyses of reactivity in two important limiting behaviors, i.e. gaseous and\ncondensed phases.\nIn the present paper we examine the solvation of an excess proton in mesoscopic clusters\nof the type H+ [H2 O]n , with sizes intermediate between n = 10 and n = 125. This size range\ncovers aggregates with incipient three dimensional structures up to nanoclusters where it\nis possible to establish a clear distinction between inner, \"bulk-like\", domains and surface\nstates. Our analysis will be based on results obtained from Molecular Dynamics simulation\nexperiments and includes the study of the equilibrium solvation structures and dynamical\naspects related to proton transfer processes as well. To tackle the problem we resorted\non an multistate empirical valence bond (MS-EVB) model Hamiltonian.7,8,9,10,11 This approach has been repeatedly used in the past and has proved to be sufficiently versatile so\nas to be successfully applied for the examination of aqueous protons in a wide variety of\nenvironments: bulk,8,9,10,12,13,14,15,16,17,18 clusters,19,20 confined environments,21,22,23 air-water\ninterfaces,24 and water at extreme conditions of temperature and pressure,25 to cite a just\na few important examples. The organization of the paper is as follows: in Section II we\npresent a brief overview of the model and the simulation procedure. The main results are\npresented in Section III. The last section contains the concluding remarks.\n\n2\n\n\fII.\n\nMODEL AND SIMULATION PROCEDURE\n\nThe systems under investigation consisted of protonated clusters of the type H+ [H2 O]n ,\nwith n = 10, 21 and 125. The Molecular Dynamics experiments were performed using an\nMS-EVB scheme. This model has been thoroughly described in previous studies, so we\nwill present here a brief overview of its main features and refer the interested reader to\nRefs.12,13,14,15,16 , for more complete presentations.\nThe cornerstone of the model is the following MS-EVB Hamiltonian:\n\u0124EVB ({R}) =\n\nX\n\n|\u03c6i ihij ({R})h\u03c6j | ;\n\n(1)\n\nij\n\nwhere {|\u03c6i i} represents a basis set of diabatic states. Each of these states denotes the spatial\nlocalization of the excess proton in a different water molecule. The matrix elements of the\nMS-EVB Hamiltonian, hij ({R}), are parametrized in terms of the nuclear coordinates and\nare adjusted so that EVB predictions for the energetics and geometrical details of small\nprotonated water clusters agree with those obtained from highly sophisticated ab initio\ncalculations.14\nAt each step of the Molecular Dynamics runs, the simulation procedure involved the\nconstruction of a connectivity pattern of hydrogen bonds (HB), linking the water molecule\nexhibiting strongest H3 O+ character (hereafter referred to as the pivot water and denoted\nH2 O\u2217 ) with its first, second \u2013 and eventually \u2013 third solvation shells. This pattern allowed\nthe identification of the instantaneous diabatic states included in the construction of \u0124EVB .\nFor n = 10 and n = 20, the number of EVB states considered was intermediate between 8\nand 15; this number went up to typically 20, for simulations of the largest aggregates.\nThe dynamics of the classical nuclei was generated from the following Newton's equations\nof motions:\n\nd2 Rk\n= \u2212\u2207Rk \u01eb0 ({R}) ;\ndt2\nwhere \u01eb0 ({R}) represents the lowest eigenvalue of the EVB Hamiltonian, namely:\nMk\n\n\u0124EVB |\u03c80 i = \u01eb0 ({R})|\u03c80 i .\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nIn the previous equation, |\u03c80 i is the ground state eigenstate of \u0124EVB , whose expression in\nterms of the diabatic states can be written as:\n|\u03c80 i =\n\nX\ni\n\n3\n\nci |\u03c6i i .\n\n(4)\n\n\fThe index of the largest expansion coefficient, ci , identifies the instantaneous pivot water,\nwhich can be eventually updated, in the advent of a proton translocation episode.\nDiagonal elements hii ({R}) included inter- and intra-molecular interactions involving the\nH3 O+ group and the rest of the water molecules,14 that were modeled using the flexible TIP3\nmodel.26 All simulation experiments began with a \u223c 0.5 ns preliminary thermalization stage,\nat temperatures close to T \u223c 200 K. In this thermal regime, the clusters exhibited structural\nand dynamical characteristics similar to those observed in liquidlike phases. Subsequent to\nthis equilibration period, statistics were collected from constant energy trajectories, lasting\ntypically \u223c 5 \u2212 10 ns.\n\nIII.\n\nA.\n\nRESULTS\n\nSolvation structures\n\nMesoscopic clusters represent inhomogeneous environments at the nanometer scale. Perhaps the first important question to be answered in connection with the solvation of an\nexcess proton in a water cluster concerns the average localization of the excess charge. In\nthis context, the consideration of two local density fields with respect to the center of mass\nof the cluster will be useful: The first one, \u03c1CM\u2212O\u2217 (r), involves the position of the pivot\nwater and is defined as:\n\u03c1CM\u2212O\u2217 (r) =\n\n1\nh\u03b4(|rO\u2217 \u2212 RCM | \u2212 r)i .\n4\u03c0r 2\n\n(5)\n\nNote that \u03c1CM\u2212O\u2217 (r) represents the probability distribution of finding the pivot at a distance\nr from the center of mass of the aggregate. In the previous equation, rO\u2217 and RCM denote\nthe positions of the pivot and the center of mass of the cluster, respectively. The second\ndensity, \u03c1CM\u2212W (r), involves the rest of the water molecules and is defined as:\nX\n1 n\u22121\nh\u03b4(|roi=1 \u2212 RCM | \u2212 r)i ;\n\u03c1CM\u2212W (r) =\n2\n4\u03c0r i\n\n(6)\n\nwhere roi represents the coordinate of oxygen site in the i-th molecule and the sum involves\nall the water molecules, except the one acting as pivot.\nResults for both functions are depicted in Fig. 1. The profiles of the bottom panel\ncontrast sharply to those shown in the upper ones: For the smallest size considered, n = 10,\n4\n\n\fit is evident that the excess charge localizes closer to the center of mass of the aggregate. A\nsnapshot of a typical cluster configuration for a protonated clusters of this size is depicted\nFig. 2. Note that the overall structure looks as a mostly planar, star-like, arrangement of\nhydrogen bonded water molecules, with the three-coordinated hydronium lying at a central\nposition.\nThe situation changes at a qualitative level in larger aggregates (see middle and top\npanels of Figs. 1). Under these circumstances, the water local density at the central part\nlooks much more uniform and its value does not differ substantially from the usual one\n= 0.033 \u00c5\u22123 . Snapshots for\nfor bulk water at ambient conditions: \u03c1CM\u2212O\u2217 (r \u223c 0) \u223c \u03c1bulk\nw\ncluster configurations in this size range are also included in Fig. 2 and reveal that, in both\ncases, the aggregates exhibit a three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded structure, in which it is\npossible to discriminate bulk from surface states environments. As for the position of the\nproton is concerned, there are clear indications that the regions for stable proton solvation\nin both cases are located at the corresponding cluster boundaries. This observation has\nbeen previously reported19 and has also been found in simulations of protons at macroscopic\nwater-air interfaces.24\nIt is also of interest to investigate the closest solvation structures of the excess charge.\nIn bulk water, the microscopic description of such environments includes a whole series\nof arrangements which are intermediate between two limiting moieties, with well defined\ngeometry: We are referring to the symmetric Zundel (ZDL) dimer27 [H2 O-H-OH2]+ and\nthree-coordinated Eigen (EGN) cation28 [H3 O*(H2 O)3 ]+ . Interconversions between these\nstructures take place in the picosecond time scale and seems to be triggered by changes\nin the intramolecular connectivity between the proton closest solvation shells. The relative\nprevalence of these structures can be conveniently monitored by considering probability\ndensities associated to an appropriate order parameter identifying EGN and ZDL complexes.\nIn the MS-EVB model, such order parameter can be expressed in terms of the two largest\nexpansion coefficients (see Eq. 3) as:14,16\n\u03be = c21 \u2212 c22\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\nZDL and EGN solvation environments are characterized by values of \u03be close to 0 and 1,\nrespectively. In Fig. 3 we present results for W (\u03be), the free energy associated to the order\n\n5\n\n\fparameter:\n \u0303 \u221d \u2212 lnh\u03b4(\u03be \u2212 \u03be)i\n \u0303 ;\n\u03b2W (\u03be)\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03b2 is the inverse of Boltzmann constant times the temperature and h....i represents a\nstatistical average. For the sake of comparison, we have also included in the figure the results\nfor bulk water reported in Refs. [14, 16] In all cases, the most stable structures \u2013 which\ncorrespond to the global minimum of W (\u03be) \u2013 are characterized by values of \u03bemin \u223c 0.55. The\nmagnitude of the free energy differences between EGN-like and ZDL-like structures though,\ndoes depend on the particular environment considered. Results for W (\u03be = 0) in aggregates\nwith n = 21 and n = 125 are practically identical, revealing that the characteristics of\nthe surface dynamical modes triggering EGN-ZDL interconversions are comparable for both\ncluster sizes. On the other hand, for n = 10, EGN-ZDL interconversions become much more\nfrequent and are dominated exclusively by polarization fluctuations in the aggregate. The\ndifferences in temperature preclude the direct comparison of these results to those observed\nin bulk water at ambient conditions; anyhow, our simulations show that the free energy\nbarrier for the isotropic bulk phases is \u223c 0.5 kcal mol\u22121 higher than the one observed at the\nsurface of the largest clusters.\nTo gain additional insight on the local coordination of the excess charge, we also examined\npair correlations involving the O\u2217 site. In the top panel of Fig. 4 we show plots for pair\ncorrelations between the pivot O\u2217 and oxygen (top panel) and hydrogen (bottom panel) sites\nin the rest of the aqueous domains. Correlations with oxygen sites are dominated by main\npeaks located at r \u223c 2.5 \u00c5 which involves \u223c 2.9 water-oxygen sites acting as HB acceptors.\nThe magnitude and position of these peaks do not change with the cluster size and are\nsimilar to those observed in bulk water.14 The overall shapes of the pivot-hydrogen profiles\nare also dominated by main peaks shifted \u223c 0.6 \u00c5 outward and include six hydrogen atoms\nbelonging to water molecules in the pivot first solvation shell. Consequently, we are led to\nconclude that, in all aqueous environments investigated, the closest solvation structures of\nthe proton are preserved, being characterized by a first solvation shell composed by three\nwater molecules, acting as HB acceptors with no evidence of pivot HB of the type O-H* * *O\u2217\n.\n\n6\n\n\fB.\n\nProton transfer\n\nHaving established the main features of the equilibrium solvation structures of the proton, we now move to the consideration of the dynamical characteristics related to transfer\nprocesses in aqueous clusters. In order to acquire a preliminary notion of the timescales\ncharacterizing proton translocation events in water clusters, in Fig. 5 we present the time\nevolutions of the pivot label during a 1 ns time interval. At a first glance, it is selfevident\nthat proton jumps become much more frequent as we move to larger aggregates. At T \u223c 200\nK and for n = 10, the dynamics of the pivot label can be pictured as a sequence of three\nwell differentiated classes of episodes: (i) on one hand, one observes fast resonances in the\nsubpicosecond time domain, between ZDL pairs interrupted by (ii) stages during which the\npivot label remains practically unchanged for several hundreds of picoseconds. (iii) The\nstabilization of the proton in a different water pivot is a much more rare event since it is\nnormally preceded by major rearrangements of the overall cluster geometry. These modifications involve changes in the localization of the potential donor and acceptor molecules,\nrequiring the migration of the acceptor molecule towards a more central position within\nthe aggregate. This is operated by the breakage and regeneration of new HB, that take\nplace over lengthscales comparable to the overall size of the aggregate. Although the time\nevolutions of the pivot label for larger aggregates present similar qualitative characteristics,\ntranslocation episodes do occur much more frequently. Concerning possible mechanisms that\nmight trigger transfer episodes at cluster surfaces, the direct inspection of the close vicinity\nof the acceptor-donor pair revealed that the transfer dynamics is operated by subtle changes\nin the HB structure in the second and third solvation shells. In this respect, although we\nhave not performed a detailed trajectory analysis of reactive processes, we are led to believe\nthat the surface mechanisms that regulate translocations resemble very much those observed\nin bulk macroscopic phases.30\nA more precise estimate for the proton transfer rates can be extracted from population\nrelaxation time correlation functions of the type:\nC(t) =\n\nh\u03b4hi (t).\u03b4hi (0)i\nh(\u03b4hi )2 i\n\n;\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03b4hi (t) = hi (t) \u2212 hhi i denotes the instantaneous fluctuation of the population of the ith\nreactant away from its equilibrium value. In Eq. 9, the dynamical variable hi (t) is unity if the\nproton is localized in the i-th diabatic state at time t and zero otherwise. Provided Onsager's\n7\n\n\fregression hypothesis29 remains valid, the exponential decay at long times of C(t) should\nyield an estimate of the proton transfer rate, \u03c4tr\u22121 . Plots for ln C(t) are presented in Fig. 5;\nafter fast transients ascribed to ZDL resonances, the three curves present single exponential\ndecays. Compared to the bulk result \u03c4trblk \u223c 2 \u2212 4 ps, the estimates for the characteristic\ntimescales in clusters are intermediate between one and two orders of magnitude larger:\n\u03c4tr125 \u223c 20 ps and \u03c4tr10 \u223c 130 ps.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nThe structural and dynamical characteristics of excess protons embedded in liquid-state\nnanoclusters of the type H+ [H2 O]n described in this paper illustrate distinctive behaviors,\ndepending on the cluster size considered. More specifically, we focussed attention to n = 10,\n21 and 125. Taking into consideration that the cluster radii scale as R \u221d n1/3 , we tried\n< 20 aggregates, in which it is\nto cover different scenarios: on one hand, we considered n \u223c\nimpossible to discern surfance from bulk states; on the other, n \u223c 100 clusters \u2013 with R of\nthe order of three molecular diameters \u2013 perhaps the smallest ones in which such distinction\ncan be clearly established.\nIn small aggregates, the overall structures of H+ [H2 O]10 clusters can be pictured as\ndendritic-like arrays of hydrogen bonded water molecules, with the excess proton occupying\na central position. At larger sizes, there is a clear tendency for surface solvation of the excess\ncharge. Note at in all cases, these two solvation structures preserve two important characteristics of the closest aqueous environments of the excess charge: (i) the three-coordinated,\nHB donor structure of hydronium with respect to its first solvation shell and (ii) the absence\nof HB acceptor structure of the type O-H* * *O\u2217 . We remark that this anisotropies have also\nbeen reported in previous cluster studies,19,20 at water-air interfaces,24 and confined water\nwithin membranes.22\nThe observed proton dynamics dynamics in small clusters can be pictured as a sequence\nof three different episodes: (i) First, one observes resonance stages, during which the proton\nseems to be delocalized over a tagged ZDL pair. These fast dynamical modes of the pivot\nlabel seem to be dictated by polarization fluctuations originated in the closes solvation\nenvironments of the excess charge; (ii) The latter fluctuations seem to be also the controlling\nagent for the localization stages, during which the resonances cease and the proton gets\n8\n\n\flocalized in a single water molecule, for periods that may last typically \u223c 100 ps; (iii)\nFinally, one also observes much rare proton translocation episodes, which are preceded by\nglobal rearrangements of the hydrogen bond connectivity of the the cluster. These dynamical\ncharacteristics are maintained at a qualitative level for n = 21 and n = 125 aggregates,\nalthough the translocations become much more frequent and the triggering mechanisms\nrequire much more subtle modifications in the HB connectivity that those observed in smaller\naggregates.\n\nV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nDL and JR are staff members of CONICET-Argentina.\n\n1\n\nP.
