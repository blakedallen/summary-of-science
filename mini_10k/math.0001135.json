The latter is\nvery broadly understood and includes geometric theory of finitely generated\ngroups, group cohomology, Kazhdan groups, actions of groups on manifolds,\nsuperrigidity, fundamental groups of K\u00e4hler and quaternionic K\u00e4hler manifolds and conformal field theory. The motivation and philosophy which has\nled to the present research will be reflected upon in [Reznikov 7] and here\nwe will merely say that we believe Analysis to be a major tool in studying finitely generated groups. An alternative look is provided by arithmetic\nmethod, notably by passing to a pro-p completion and using Galois cohomology. This will be described in [Reznikov 8].\nEach of six chapters which constitute this paper opens with a short\noverview; a global picture is as follows. Chapter I and III treat analytic aspects of geometry of finitely generated groups. Given an immersion M \u0592\u2192 N\nof negatively curved manifolds (M compact) there is a boundary map \u2202 M\u0303 \u2192\n\u2202 \u00d1 , and it has remarkable regularity properties. Invoking the Thurston the1/p\nory, we show that the actions A of pseudoAnosovs on Wp (S 1 )/const have\nstriking properties from the viewpoint of functional analysis, namely,\nX\n\nn\u2208Z\n\nkAn vkp < \u221e\n\nfor some v 6= 0. We apply this to a classical problem: when a surface\nfibration is negatively curved and derive a strong necessary condition.\nWe then develop a theory of quantization for the mapping class group.\nA classical work on Dif f \u221e(S 1 ) suggests a two-step quantization: first, ob1/2\ntaining a symplectic representation in Sp(W2 (S 1 )/const) with image in\niii\n\n\fthe restricted symplectic group [Pressley-Segal 1] and then using the ShaleWeil representation. The first step meets obstacles and the second step\nbreaks down completely for the mapping class group: first, because Mapg,1\ndoes not act smoothly on S 1 , so it's unclear why it can be represented in\n1/2\nSp(W2 (S 1 )/const), second, if even it can (this happens to be the case),\nthere is no way to show that the image lies in the restricted symplectic\ngroup (it almost certainly does not). The solution comes at the price of\nabandoning the classical scheme and developing a theory of a new object\nwhich we call bicohomology spaces Hp,g . The mapping class group Mapg\nact in Hp,g and the latter shows remarkable properties, like duality and\nexistence of vacuum. The last property is translated into the fact that\n1/p\nH 1 (Mapg,1 , Wp (S 1 )/const) is not zero. Finally, we find Mapg -equivariant\nmaps of the space of all discrete representations of the surface group into\nP SL2 (C) to our spaces Hp,g .\nChapter II uses Analysis to study groups, acting on the circle (we need\nDif f 1,\u03b1 regularity, so Mapg,1 is not included). Our first main theorem says\nroughly that Kazhdan groups do not act on the circle. Very special cases of\nthis result, for lattices in Lie groups, were recently found (see the references\nin Chapter II). The Hilbert transform, which played a major role in Chapter\nI, is crucial for the proof of this result as well. We then develop a theory\nof higher characteristic classes for subgroups of Dif f 1,\u03b1 (the first being\nclassically known as an integrated Godbillon-Vey class). All this classes\nvanish on Dif f \u221e(S 1 ). It is safe to say that the less is smoothness, the more\ninteresting is the geometry \"of the circle\".\nChapter III brings us back to asymptotic geometry of finitely generated\ngroups. We propose, for a non-Kazhdan group, to study the asymptotic\nbehaviour of unitary cocycles. We prove a general convexity result which\nshows that an embedding of G in the Hilbert space, given by a unitary cocycle, is \"uniform\". We then prove a growth estimate for unitary cocycles of a\nsurface group, using very heavy machinery from complex analysis, adjusted\nfor our situation. Similar result for cocycles in H 1 (G, lp (G)) has already\nbeen given in Chapter I.\nChapter IV studies symplectomorphism groups. There is a misterious\niv\n\n\fsimilarity between groups acting on the circle and groups acting symplectically on a compact symplectic manifold. In parallel with the above mentioned result in Chapter II we show, roughly, that transformations of a\nKazhdan group acting on a symplectic manifold must satisfy a partial differential equation. An example is Sp(2n, Z) acting linearly on T 2n and,\nvery probably, Mapg acting on the space of stable bundles over a Riemann\nsurface. (I don't know for sure if Mapg is Kazhdan). In dimension 2 the\nresult is very easy and was known before. We also introduce new charateristic classes for symplectomorphism groups, in addition to the two series of\nclasses defined in our previous papers, and use them to express a volume of a\nnegatively curved manifold through the Busemann function on the universal\ncover.\nChapter V studies volume-preserving actions. We introduce a new technique into the subject, that of (infinite-dimensional, non-positively curved)\nspaces of metrics. We define a invariant of an action which is an infinum of a\ndisplacement in the space of metrics and show that for an action of a Kazhdan group which does not fix a log L2 -metric, this invariant is positive (a\nweak version of this result for the special case of lattices was known before).\nWe then turn to a major open problem, that of non-linear superrigidity and\nprove what seems to be first serious breakthrough after many years of effort.\nChapter VI deals with fundamental groups of K\u00e4hler and quaternionic\nK\u00e4hler manifolds. The situation is exactly the opposite to the studied in\nChapters II and IV, namely, these groups tend to be Kazhdan. We first\nextend our rationality theorem for secondary classes of flat bundles over\nprojective varietes to the case of quasiprojective varietes, answering a question posed to us by P.Deligne. We then prove that a fundamental group of\na compact quaternionic K\u00e4hler manifold is Kazhdan, therefore providing a\nvery strong restriction on its topology. We also discuss polynomial growth\nof the group cohomology classes for K\u00e4hler groups, proved nontrivial in a\nprevious paper.\nThe paper uses many different analytic techniques. Within each chapter,\nthere is a certain coherence in the point of view adopted for study.\nI started this project on a chilly evening of November, 1998 in an African\nv\n\n\fcaf\u00e9 in Leipzig and finished it on a hot afternoon of July, 1999 in Jerusalem.\nThe manuscript has been written up by August, 11, 1999; I would appreciate any mentioning of a possible overlap with any paper/preprint which\nappeared before this date. During the long time when the paper was being\ntyped and then polished, I found a proof of several statements which had\nbeen conjectured in the paper, in particular a construction of a cocycle for\n1/p\nthe group of quasisymmetric homeomorphisms valued in Wp (S 1 )/const,\nwhich was conjectured in Chapter I. The proofs will appear in a sequel to\nthis paper.\n\nvi\n\n\fChapter 1\n\nAnalytic topology of\nnegatively curved manifolds,\nquantum strings and\nmapping class groups\nChapter I opens with simple observations concerning the cohomology H 1 (G, l\u221e (G))\nfor a finitely-generated group. If G is amenable we produce plenty of polynomial cohomology classes in H \u2217 (G, R) given by an explicit formula (Theorem\n1.2.1). Then we prove a convexity theorem 1.2.2 saying that if there are\nEuclidean-type quasigeodesics in the Cayley graph of G, then G/[G, G] is\ninfinite.\nWe then review some standard facts on lp -cohomology in sections 2\u20134.\nOne defines an asymptotic invariant of a finitely generated group G, called a\nconstant of coarse structure \u03b1(G), as an infinum of p, 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e such that\nH 1 (G, lp (G)) 6= 0. For all noncusp discrete groups of motions of complete\nmanifolds of pinched negative curvature, \u03b1(G) < \u221e. For discrete subgroups\nG of SO + (1, n), \u03b1(G) \u2264 \u03b4(G), where \u03b4 is the exponent of the group. In\nsection 4 we review function spaces. A classical result in weighted Sobolev\nspaces may be reformulated as an identification of the lp -cohomology of\n(n\u22121)/p\ncocompact real hyperbolic lattices: H 1 (G, lp (G)) = Wp\n(S n\u22121 )/const\n1\n\n\f. It follows that \u03b1(G) = n \u2212 1.\nIn section 5 we prove a first result within a program to classify groups\naccording to the cocycle growth. We show for surface groups, that if Lg F \u2212\n\u2032\nF \u2208 lp (G) for all g \u2208 G, then |F(g)| \u2264 const * [length(g)]1/p . Here F : G \u2192\nR is any function (Theorem 5.6). This result with no doubt generalizes to\nhigher-dimensional cocompact lattices in simple Lie groups of rank one.\nIn section 6 we present a new theory for boundary maps of negatively\ncurved spaces, associated with immersions of closed manifolds. The most\nstriking is a partial regularity result (Theorem 6.1, part 4).\nAs is well known, the group of quasisymmetric (n = 2) or quasiconformal\nn\u22121\n\n(n \u2265 3) homeomorphisms of S n\u22121 act on Wp p (S n\u22121 ) for p > n \u2212 1. The\n1/2\naction of G1 on W2 (S 1 )/const is in fact symplectic. We give application to\nthe regularity of quasisymmetric homeomorphisms (Theorem 8.2). In Corollary 9.2 we prove that the unitary representation of a subgroup G of SO(1, 2)\n1/2\nin W2 (S 1 )/const is an invariant of a component of the Teichm\u00fcller space\nT(G).\nIn Theorem 9.3 we show striking properties of invertible operators A in\n1/p\nBanach spaces Wp (S 1 )/const, p > 2, induced by quasiAnosov maps in\nMapg,1 , namely\nX\nkAk vkp < \u221e\nk\u2208Z\n\nfor some 0 6= v. In Theorem 9.5 we find a new inequality in topological\nArakelov theory, based on the work of [Matsumoto-Morita 1]. In Theorem\n9.6 we find very strong restrictions on a subgroup G \u2282 Mapg , such that an\ne\ninduced group extension G:\ne\u2192G\u21921\n1 \u2192 \u03c01 (\u03a3g ) \u2192 G\n\nis a fundamental group of a negatively curved compact manifold (this is\na classical problem). In section 10 we extend the theory to the limit case\np = 1, introducing an L1 -analogue of Zigmund spaces, which we call Lk,\u03b1 .\nIn section 11 we start a new theory of secondary quantization of Teichm\u00fcller spaces. We introduce the bicohomology spaces Hg,p and show that\nMapg acts on these spaces. We show (difficult!) that H2,p is an infinitedimensional Hilbert space and there is a symmetric bilinear nondegenerate\n2\n\n\fform of signature (\u221e, m) which is Mapg -invariant. What is the value of\nm, we don't know at the time of writing of this introduction (August,1999).\nSo does the secondary quantization lead to ghosts? We provide a holomorphic realization in the space of L2 -holomorphic 2-forms on H2 \u00d7 H2 /G and\nH2 \u00d7 H2 /G (Theorem 11.12). In section 12 we interpret Hp,g as operator spaces (proposition 12.2), and prove the existence of vacuum (Theorem\n1/p\n12.5). We prove that H 1 (Mapg,1 , Wp (S 1 )/const) 6= 0 for p \u2265 2. It still\nmay be true that Mapg,1 is Kazhdan, because the action is not orthogonal.\n\nIn section 13 we construct Mapg -equivariant maps of the space of discrete representations of the surface group in SO + (1, 3) = P SL2 (C) to our\nspaces Hp,g (Theorem 13.1). In Theorem 13.2 we summarize our knowledge of the functional-analytic structure coming from hyperbolic 3-manifolds\nwhich fiber over the circle.\n\n1.1\n\nMetric cohomology\n\n1.1.1. Let G be a finitely generated group. Let K = R, C. Let V be\na locally convex topological K-vector space which is a G-module, that is,\nthere is a homomorphism G \u2192 Aut(V ). If {gi }, i = 1, * * * , n is a finite\nset of generators of G, then the evaluation map f 7\u2192 {f (gi )} establishes an\ninjective homomorphism Z 1 (G, V ) \u2192 \u03a0ni=1 V of the space of 1-cocycles of\nG in V . One calls the induced topology in Z 1 (G, V ) the cocycle topology;\nit does not depend on the choice of generators. A coboundary map V \u2192\nZ 1 (G, V ) may have an image B 1 (G, V ) which is not closed in Z 1 (G, V );\nthe quotient Z 1 (G, V )/B 1 (G, V ) is called reduced first cohomology space.\nOne way to produce nontrivial cohomology classes is to consider limits of\ncoboundaries, that is, elements of B 1 (G, V )/B 1 (G, V ). That amounts to\nconsidering nets {v\u03b1 \u2208 V } such that gi v\u03b1 \u2212 v\u03b1 \u2192 l(gi ) for i = 1, * * * , n. If V\nis a Banach space and G acts isometrically without invariant vectors, then\nB 1 (G, V ) is closed in Z 1 (G, V ) if and only if there are no almost invariant\nvectors, that is, sequences vj , kvj k = 1, such that kgi vj \u2212 vj k \u2192 0 for all\ni = 1, * * * , n. This statement is an immediate consequence of the Banach\n3\n\n\ftheorem and is called Guichardet's lemma [Guichardet 1]. So if there are\nalmost invaiant vectors, then H 1 (G, V ) 6= 0, though the reduced cohomology\n1 (G, V ) may be zero.\nHred\nIf V is Banach and G acts isometrically, let l \u2208 Z 1 (G, V ) be a cocycle.\nThen\nn\nkl(g)k \u2264 max kl(gi )k * length(g)\ni=1\n\n, where length(g) is the length of the element g in the word metric, induced\nby {gi }. The proof is immediate by induction, using the cocycle equation\nl(gh) = gl(h) + l(g).\nNow let Vj , j = 1, * * * , m be a collection of Banach spaces on which G\nacts isometrically and let \u03c6 : \u2297m\nj=1 V \u2192 K be a map continuous in a sense\nm\nm\nthat \u03c6(\u2297j=1 vj ) \u2264 const * \u03a0j=1 kvj k. Let lj \u2208 Z 1 (G, Vj ) and let l \u2208 Z m (G, K)\nbe the cup product l(g1 , * * * , gm ) = \u03c6(\u2297m\nj=1 lj (gj )).\nLemma 1.1.- l \u2208 Z m (G, K) is of polynomial growth, more precisely\n|l(g1 , * * * , gm )| \u2264 const * \u03a0m\ni=1 length(gi ).\nProof.- is immediate from the remarks made above.\nA general definition of polynomial cohomology is to be found in [ConnesMoscovici 1]. As we will see, Lemma 1.1 is a very powerful tool for constructing cocycles of polynomial growth in concrete situations.\nProposition 1.1.- Let G be an infinite finitely generated group. Consider a left action of G on l\u221e (G). Then H 1 (G, l\u221e (G)) 6= 0. Moreover,\nH 1 (G, l0\u221e (G)) 6= 0.\nProof.- Let {gi } be a finite set of generators of G, and let length(g) be\na word length of an element g. Define a right-invariant word metric by\n\u03c1(x, y) = length(xy \u22121 ). Let x0 \u2208 G and let F (x) = \u03c1(x0 , x). Obviously, F\nis unbounded. Now let l(g) = Lg F \u2212F where Lg is a left action on functions,\nthat is, l(g)(x) = F (g \u22121 x) \u2212 F (x). We find\n|l(g)(x)| = |\u03c1(x0 , g \u22121 x) \u2212 \u03c1(x0 , x)| \u2264 |\u03c1(g \u22121 x, x)| = \u03c1(g \u22121 , 1).\n4\n\n\fSo l is a cocycle of G in l\u221e (G). If it were trivial, we would have a bounded\nfunction f such that Lg F \u2212 F = Lg f \u2212 f that is, F \u2212 f would be invariant,\ntherefore constant, a contradiction. The second statement of the Proposition\nwill be proved later in section 1.3.\n1.1.2. Now let G be amenable. In this case we have a continuous map\nR\n\u221e\n\u03c6 : \u03a0m\nj=1 l (G) \u2192 K given by (f1 , * * * , fm ) 7\u2192 G f1 * * * fm . By an integral\nwe mean a left-invariant normalized mean of bounded functions. We obtain\nTheorem 1.2.1.- Let G be a finitely generated amenable group, let \u03c1j , j =\n1, * * * , m be a collection of right-invariant word metrics on G. A formula\nZ\n\u22121\n\u03a0m\nl(g1 , * * * , gm ) =\nj=1 [\u03c1j (x0 , gj x) \u2212 \u03c1j (x0 , x)]\nG\n\ndefines a real-valued m-cocycle on G of polynomial growth:\n|l(g1 , * * * , gm )| \u2264 const * \u03a0m\nj=1 length(gj )\nfor any word length length(*).\nExamples.- Let G = Z. If we choose generators {\u22121, 1}, then length(g) =\n|g|, and\n\u03c1(x0 , g \u22121 x) \u2212 \u03c1(x0 , x) = |x0 \u2212 x + g| \u2212 |x0 \u2212 x| \u2192 \u00b1|g|\nas x \u2192 \u00b1\u221e and\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n(|x0 \u2212 x + g| \u2212 |x0 \u2212 x|) = 0.\n\nHowever, if we choose generators {\u22121, 2}, then\n\nThen\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ng\u22640\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 |g|,\ng\nlength(g) =\n, g \u2265 0 and even\n2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ng+1\n\uf8f3\n, g \u2265 0 and odd\n2\nlength(x0 + g \u2212 x) \u2212 length(x0 \u2212 x)\n5\n\n\ffor g > 0 and even will have limits g2 when x \u2192 \u2212\u221e and \u2212g when x \u2192 \u221e,\nso\nZ\ng\n[length(x0 + g \u2212 x) \u2212 length(x0 \u2212 x)] = \u2212 .\n4\nZ\nSo we obtain a cocycle l : Z \u2192 R given by g 7\u2192 \u2212 g4 . Now, if G = Zk , k \u2265 2,\nlet \u03c1j , j = 1, * * * , k be a word metric defined by a set of generators\n\u00b11\n\u22121 2 \u00b11\n\u00b11\n{e\u00b11\n1 , e2 , * * * , ej , ej , ej+1 , * * * , ek }\n\nwhere es is a generator of the s-th factor. If 1 \u2264 j1 < j2 < * * * < jm \u2264 k is a\nset of indices, then Theorem 2 provides a cocycle\nZ\n\u22121\n\u03a0m\nl(g1 , * * * , gm ) =\nr=1 [\u03c1jr (x0 , gj x) \u2212 \u03c1jr (x0 , x)].\nZk\n\nIf \u03c0i : Zk \u2192 Z is a projection to i-th factor, then l(g1 , * * * , gm ) = (\u2212 14 )m *\n\u03a0m\nr=1 \u03c0jr (gr ). It follows that classes of cocycles, given by Theorem 1.2.1,\ngenerate the real cohomology space of Zk .\nRemark.- If G is amenable, \u03c1 is a right-invariant word metrics and for some\nx0 , g \u2208 G,\nZ\nG\n\n[\u03c1(x0 , g\u22121 x) \u2212 \u03c1(x0 , x)] 6= 0,\n\nthen H1 (G, R) 6= 0 and in fact g \u2208\n/ [G, G] for all s 6= 0. This is a direct\ncorollary of Theorem 1.2.1. A more interesting structure theorem is given\nbelow.\n\nTheorem 1.2.2.- Let G be a finitely generated amenable group, \u03c1 a rightinvariant word metric. Let g \u2208 G, assume a following convexity condition:\nthere is some C > 0, such that for any x \u2208 G there exists N \u2265 0 such that\n\u03c1(gk , g\u22121 x) \u2212 \u03c1(g k , x) \u2265 C for k \u2265 N . Then H1 (G, R) 6= 0 and moreover,\ngs \u2208\n/ [G, G] for all s 6= 0.\nCorollary 1.2.3.- Let G be a Heisenberg group {x, y, z|[x, y] = z, [x, z] =\n[y, z] = 1}. Then for any right-invariant word metric \u03c1, there exists a \u2208 G\nsuch that lim inf k\u2192\u221e [\u03c1(z k , z \u22121 a) \u2212 \u03c1(z k , a)] \u2264 0.\n6\n\n\fProof of the Corollary.- Since z \u2208 [G, G], the result follows from Theorem\n1.2.2. Indeed G is nilpotent, therefore amenable.\nProof of the Theorem.- Consider a 1-cocycle l(\u03b3)(x) = \u03c1(x0 , \u03b3 \u22121 x)\u2212\u03c1(x0 , x),\nl \u2208 Z 1 (G, l\u221e (G)). Set x0 = g n , so\nln (g)(x) = \u03c1(g n , g\u22121 x) \u2212 \u03c1(g n , x).\n\nIf for any x and sufficiently big n, \u03c1(gn , g\u22121 x)\u2212\u03c1(gn , x) > C then a pointwise\nlimit limn\u2192\u221e ln (g)(x) exists and is \u2265 C. Since |ln (z)(x)| \u2264 \u03c1(z \u22121 , 1), there is\na subsequence nk such that lnk (z) converges pointwise for any z to a bounded\nfunction l(z). One sees immediately that l : G \u2192 l\u221e (G) is a cocycle, so\nR\nz 7\u2192 G l(z) is a homomorphism from G to R. Since l(g)(x) \u2265 C > 0 for all\nR\n/ [G, G], as desired.\nx, G l(g) \u2265 C > 0, so H1 (G, R) 6= 0 and g s \u2208\n1.1.3. Let \u03c6 : R+ \u2192 R+ be a smooth function such that \u03c6(x) \u2192 \u221e as\nx \u2192 \u221e and \u03c6\u2032 (x) \u2192 0. Let G be a finitely generated group and let \u03c1 be a\nright-invariant word metric. Consider F (x) = \u03c6(\u03c1(x0 , x)) where x0 \u2208 G is a\nfixed element.

Therefore H 1 (G, l0\u221e (G)) 6= 0, because the cocycle\nLg F \u2212 F cannot be trivial as a cocycle valued in l0\u221e (by the same reasons\nas in the proof of the first statement of Proposition 1.1 ) . The proof of\nProposition 1.1 is now complete.\nNotice that, since \u03c1(u, v) = length(u * v \u22121 ),\n\u03c1(x0 , x) \u2212 length(g) \u2264 \u03c1(x0 , g\u22121 x) \u2264 \u03c1(x0 , x) + length(g),\n7\n\n\fso that\n|(Lg F \u2212 F )(x)| \u2264\n\nsup\n|t\u2212\u03c1(x0 ,x)|\u2264length(g)\n\n|\u03c6\u2032 (t)| \u00d7 \u03c1(g \u22121 , 1).\n\nRemark.- Let S(N ) = {g|length(g) = N }. If S(N )/S(N \u2212 1) \u2192 1 and\nPN\nk=1 S(k)/S(N ) \u2192 \u221e as N \u2192 \u221e, then for p > 1 there is a radial function\nF (x) = \u03c6(\u03c1(x)) such that Lg F \u2212 F \u2208 lp (G) and the cocycle l : G \u2192 lp (G)\ndefined by g 7\u2192 Lg F \u2212 F is not a coboundary. Note that G is automatically\namenable. On the other hand, if S(N ) \u223c ecN , then such radial function does\nnot exist. This follows at once from Hardy's inequality. To produce classes\nin H 1 (G, lp (G)), one needs to use some more elaborate geometry than just\ndistance function. In the next section we produce such classes for negatively\ncurved groups/manifolds, using the visibility angles.\n\n1.2\n\nConstants of coarse structure for negatively\ncurved groups\n\n1.2.1. Throughout this section we assume that G is a finitely generated,\nnon-amenable group, therefore B 1 (G, lp (G)) is closed in Z 1 (G, lp (G)) for\np \u2265 1.\nDefinition 2.1.- A number \u03b1(G) = inf 1\u2264p\u2264\u221e {p|H 1 (G, lp (G)) 6= 0} is called\na constant of coarse structure of G.\nRemark.- The definition makes sense since by Proposition 1.1, H 1 (G, l\u221e (G)) 6=\n0. We will need a proof of the following well-known fact (see, for example\n[Pansu 1]). The argument below is a slightly modified, from nonpositive curvature to negative curvature, version of a classical argument of [Mishchenko\n1,2].\nProposition 2.1.- Let M n be a complete Riemannian manifold of negative\n8\n\n\fcurvature, not a cusp, satisfying K(M ) \u2264 \u22121, Ric(M ) \u2265 \u2212(n \u2212 1)K. Let\n\u221a\nG = \u03c01 (M ). Then \u03b1(G) \u2264 (n \u2212 1) K.\nf. Consider a map of G onto an orbit O of q0 : g 7\u2192 gq0 ;\nProof.- Let q0 \u2208 M\nit is equivariant with respect to the left action of G on itself. Let q \u2208\n/ O and\nlet vq (s) be an outward pointing vector from q to s, that is, a unit vector\nf, tangent to geodesic segment joining q and s. Consider for x \u2208 G,\nin Ts M\nf. We can consider\nF (x) = vq (xq0 ). Notice that F (x) takes values in Txq0 M\nf on O as an equivariant vector bundle over O. Pulling\nthe restriction of T M\nback to G, we obtain an left-equivariant vector bundle over G, equipped\nwith an equivariant Euclidean structure. Then F is a section of this bundle.\nNow consider (Lg F \u2212 F )(x). Since the action of G on sections is given by\nf \u2192 Tgs M\nf),\nLg F (x) = g\u2217 F (g\u22121 x), where g\u2217 is the derivative map ( g\u2217 : Ts M\nwe get (Lg F \u2212 F )(x) = g\u2217 F (g \u22121 x) \u2212 F (x) = g\u2217 vq (g\u22121 xq0 ) \u2212 vq (xq0 ) =\nvgq (xq0 )\u2212vq (xq0 ). So k(Lg F \u2212F )(x)k = |2 sin 21 \u2222(gq, xq0 , q)| \u2264 \u2222(gq, xq0 , q).\nLet E|G be the equivariant Euclidean vector bundle considered above\nf|O). Let Lp (E) be a Banach space of Lp -sections of\n(the pullback of G of T M\n\u221a\nE. We claim Lg F \u2212F \u2208 Lp (E) for p > (n\u22121) K.

Note we only need that G\nf.\nacts discretely in M\n\nA map l : G \u2192 Lp (E) defined by l(g) = Lg F \u2212 F is obviously a cocycle.\nIf it were trivial, we would have an Lp -section s \u2208 Lp (E), such that F \u2212 s\nis invariant. That means g\u2217 (vq (g \u22121 xq0 ) \u2212 s(g\u22121 x)) = vq (xq0 ) \u2212 s(x), or\nvgq (xq0 ) \u2212 g\u2217 s(g\u22121 x) = vq (xq0 ) \u2212 s(x). Notice that since kF (x)k = 1, F \u2212 s\nis invariant and ks(g)k \u2192 0 as length(g) \u2192 \u221e, k(F \u2212 s)(x)k = 1 for all x.\nIn particular, w = vq (xq0 ) \u2212 s(x) has norm one.

We will see later that if G is\na cocompact lattice in SO+ (1, n), i.e. K(M ) = \u22121, then \u03b1(G) is exactly\n(n \u2212 1). Let now G be a discrete nonamenable subgroup of SO + (1, n), or,\nequivalently, K(M ) = \u22121.

It first appeared in print, with a different proof, in [Pansu\n1]. We include a proof here, as many parts of it will be used in the theory\nlater.\nTheorem 4.1, part 1.- Let G \u2282 SO+ (1, n) be a cocompact (uniform)\nlattice.

A crucial fact is\n13\n\n\f1/2\n\nthat W2 (S 1 ) admits a natural action of the extended mapping class group\nMapg,1 . This will be proved in section 7 below.\n2)Let Hn be a hyperbolic space. Since G = \u03c01 (Hn /G), by the work of\n[Golds\u0306tein-Kuzminov-Shvedov 1 ] we know that H 1 (G, lp (G)) equals Lp cohomology of Hn . So Theorem 4.1 computes the Lp -cohomology of the\nhyperbolic space.\nRecall that any class l in H 1 (G, lp (G)) has a primitive function F : G \u2192\nR defined up to a constant, such that l(g) = Lg F \u2212 F . This follows from the\nfact that a module of all functions RG is coinduced from the trivial subgroup\nand therefore cohomologically trivial [Brown 1].\nTheorem 4.1, part 2.- Let G be a cocompact lattice in SO+ (1, n) and let\nl \u2208 H 1 (G, lp (G)), let F : G \u2192 R be a primitive function for l (unique up\nto a constant). Let \u2202G \u2248 S n\u22121 be the boundary of G as a word-hyperbolic\ngroup.

The injectivity follows immediately.\nProof of the Theorem.- Though a shorter proof of part 1 of the Theorem\n14\n\n\fcan be given by using [Goldshtein-Kuzminov-Shvedov 1], in order to prove\npart 2 we need to make an isomorphism H 1 (G, lp (G)) \u2243 Lp H 1 (Hn ) explicit.\nHere Lp H 1 (V ) is the Lp -cohomology of a complete Riemannian manifold V .\nLet l be a cocycle in Z 1 (G, lp (G)). We have then an affine isomet\u03c0\nric action g 7\u2192 (v 7\u2192 Lg v + l(g)) of G on lp (G). To it corresponds a\nsmooth locally trivial affine Banach bundle over M = Hn /G : E = [M\u0303 \u00d7\nlp (G)]/diagonal action. By local triviality, smooth partition of unity and\naffine structure on fibers one constructs a smooth section s of this bundle.\nf \u2192 lp (G), that is,\nIt can be interpreted as an equivalent smooth map s : M\ns(g\u22121 x) = Lg s(x) + l(g). We note that there is some sonstant C > 0 such\nf \u2243 Hn (\u2207s \u2208 T \u2217 M\nf\u2297lp (G) ). This is because\nthat k\u2207s(x)k < C for all x \u2208 M\nx\nM is compact. Now let F \u2208 RG be a primitive for l, i.e. l(g) = Lg F \u2212 F.\nf \u2192 RG with the same derivative\nPut \u03c3(x) = s(x)+F: this is a function \u03c3 : M\nas s in the sense that for all g \u2208 G, \u2207\u03c3g = \u2207sg where \u03c3g , sg means g-th coordinate. Next, we claim that \u03c3 is invariant, i.e. \u03c3(g\u22121 x) = Lg \u03c3(x). In fact,\nl(g) = Lg F \u2212F, so s(g\u22121 x) = Lg s(x)+Lg F \u2212F, so \u03c3(g \u22121 x) = Lg \u03c3(x). So for\nx \u2208 M\u0303 and g, h \u2208 G we have \u03c3(g\u22121 x)(h) = \u03c3(x)(g \u22121 h). Let f (x) = \u03c3(x)(1),\nthen \u03c3(x)(g) = f (gx).

In particular, f |S n\u22121 mod constants does not depend on the choice of a section s.\nSince changing l by a coboundary leads to an isomorphc affine lp (G)-bundle,\nf |S n\u22121 mod constants depends only on the class [l] \u2208 H 1 (G, lp (G)). So we\nn\u22121\n\nget a well-defined operator H 1 (G, lp (G)) \u2192 Wp p /const. We claim it is\nf \u00d7 lp (G), where\nbounded. An affine flat bundle E has been defined as M\nG\n\nG acts on lp (G) by v 7\u2192 Lg v + l(g). It is enough to show, that there is\na constant C, depending only on G but not on l, such that E possesses a\nLipschitz section s with k\u2207sk < C * klk, where klk = supi kl(gi )k for a choice\nof generators gi , i = 1, * * * , m. We note that l effectively controls the monodromy of the flat connection in E.

To prove Theorem 6.2, 1) we notice that a restriction of any\n1\n\nfunction u \u2208 W21 (S 2 ) on a quasicircle belongs to the class W22 (S 1 ). This\nfollows immediately from the invariance of W21 (S 2 ) under quasiconformal\nhomeomorphisms, and a fact that functions from W21 (B 2 ) have traces in\n1\n\nW22 (S 1 )(notice that the Dirichlet energy of a function of two variables is an\ninvariant of the conformal class of a metric).\nAs the reader has noticed, we could assume \u03c01 (M ) = \u03c01 (N ), so that \u03c01 (M )\ne and N = N\ne /\u03c01 (M ). On the other hand, the proof does\nacts discretely in N\nnot use the fact that M is embedded, so the Theorem 6.1 stays true for\n(finite-to-one)immersions in N .\nWe will outline now, having in mind the applications in the sequel to\nthis paper, how to study the limit maps from the point of view of ergodic\ntheory. The results thus obtained are weaker then those proved above,\nbut apply to non-discrete representations. Our treatment can be seen as a\ndevelopment of a vague remark of [Thurston 1, 6.4.4]. Let M m be a compact\ne = Hn and \u03c1 : \u03c01 (M ) \u2192 Iso(N\ne ) a discrete faithful\nhyperbolic mainfold, N\ne /\u03c1(\u03c01 (M )). We would like to study a boundary\nrepresentation. Let N = N\nf\u2192N\ne where \u03c6 is a smooth map M \u2192 N , inducing \u03c1.\nmap \u2202 \u03c6\ne:M\nLemma 6.5.- There exists a \u03c01 (M ) equivariant measurable map \u03c8 from\nf = S m\u22121 to the space of probability measures on \u2202 N\ne = S n\u22121 .\n\u2202M\n\nProof.- For any compact Riemannian manifold M , any compact metric\nspace X and any representation \u03c1 : \u03c01 (M ) \u2192 Homeo(X), there is a \u03c01 (M )f to the affine space of charges on X,\nequivariant harmonic function from M\ntaking values in probability measures. This simple fact is various degrees of\ngenerality has been shown in [Furstenberg 1], [L.Garnett 1], [Kaimanovichf is \u2202 M\nf, and\nVershik 1]. If M is hyperbolic, then the Poisson boundary of M\nthe result follows.\n22\n\n\fNow let \u03c80 + \u03c8c be the decomposition of \u03c8 into atomic and non-atomic\nparts. Obviously, \u03c8c is also \u03c01 (M )-equivariant. We claim \u03c8c = 0. First,\nR\nf = S n\u22121 , whence a constant, since\n\u03c8c is a \u03c01 (M )-invariant function on \u2202 M\n\u03c01 (M ) acts on S n\u22121 ergodically. So if \u03c8c 6= 0 we may assume \u03c8c is a\nprobability measure. Second, let G be a center of gravity map from the\ne to N [Furstenberg 2]. Then G \u25e6 \u03c6c is a \u03c01 (M )nonatomic measures on \u2202 N\nf to N . In particular, \u03c1(G \u25e6 \u03c8c (x), G \u25e6 \u03c8c (y)) is a\nequivariant map from \u2202 M\nf \u00d7 \u2202M\nf whence a constant by [Hopf 1] and\n\u03c01 (M )-invariant function on \u2202 M\n[Sullivan 3]. It follows easily that G \u25e6 \u03c8c = const which is impossible since\n\u03c1 is discrete. So \u03c8c = 0.\nP\nWe deduce that \u03c8 is atomic, \u03c8(z) = \u221e\ni=1 mi \u03b4(\u03c8i (z)), m1 \u2265 m2 \u2265 * * * .\nf\ne\nf \u2192 R are.\nThough \u03c8i (z) : \u2202 M \u2192 \u2202 N are not uniquely defined, mi : \u2202 M\nP\nIt follows that mi are \u03c01 (M )-invariant, whence constant. Since\nmi = 1,\nthere is some i such that mi+1 < m1 . Choose first such i. Then m1 = * * * =\nmi and we get a measurable equivariant map\nf = S m\u22121 \u2192 S n\u22121 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 S n\u22121 /Si ,\n\u2202M\n|\n{z\n}\ni\n\nwhere Si is the symmetric group in i letters.\n\nSo far we did not use the fact that \u03c1 is discrete, but only that \u03c1(\u03c01 (M ))\ne = Hm . So:\ndoes not have fixed points in N\n\nPropostion 6.6.- Let M m be a compact hyperbolic manifold and let \u03c1 :\n\u03c01 (M ) \u2192 SO + (1, n) be such that \u03c1(\u03c01 (M )) does not have fixed points in\nHn .

Now to any x \u2208 M\nmeasure \u03bcx on S m\u22121 . Its pushforward \u03c8\u2217 \u03bcx is a probability measure on\n23\n\n\fS n\u22121 .

This can easily\ns\nf\u2192\nbe shown to be continuous equivariant map M\nHn , again under some\nnatural assumption on \u03c1. The multivalued map \u03c8 should be regarded as a\nweak radial limit of s, but we will not pursue this point any further.\n\n1.7\n\nThe action of quasisymmetric and quasicon(n\u22121)/p\nformal homeomorphisms on Wp\n\nA well known result [Reimann 1] characterizes quasiconformal maps between\ndomains D1 , D2 in Rn , n > 2 as those which induce an isomorphism of Banach spaces BM O(D1 ) and BM O(D2 ).

If \u03a3g is a closed oriented surface of genus g,\n\u0393g = \u03c01 (\u03a3g ) then Mapg,1 = Aut(\u0393g ) and one has an exact sequence\n1 \u2192 \u0393g \u2192 Mapg,1 \u2192 Mapg \u2192 1.\nProposition 9.1(Quantization of the moduli space)- For any p > 1 there\nexists a representation\n\u03c0p\n\nMapg,1 \u2192 Aut(Wp1/p (S 1 )/const)\ngiven by the formula\n\u03c0p (\u03c6)(f ) = f \u25e6 \u03a6\u22121 ,\nwhere \u03a6 is a quasisymmetric homeomorphism of S 1 , induced by \u03c6 and a\nchoice of a hyperbolic structure in \u03a3g .

The reason is that \u03a6 is not a diffeomorphism, so the explicit formulae of Chapter 2 do not make sense. Moreover,\n\u03a6 is given in a very implicit way as a boundary value of a quasiconformal\nmap, defined by a quadratic differential on H2 which is G-invariant!\nWe will now show that for p > 2 the operator A\u03c6 shows very unusual\nproperties, from the point of view of functional analysis.\nTheorem 9.3.- Let G be a fundamental group of a closed hyperbolic surface\n\u03a3g .

Realize G as a lattice in SO(1, 2). Then H 1 (G, lp (G)) =\n1/p\nWp (S 1 )/const. Let H denote the Hilbert transform. It is a bounded\noperator\nH : Lp (S 1 )/const \u2192 Lp (S 1 )/const (p > 1)\ndefined as follows: for u \u2208 Lp (S 1 ) let f be its harmonic extension and g a\nconjugate harmonic function, then Hu = g|S 1 .

Moreover, H is SO(1, 2)-invariant. Then the Corollary 11.7 implies\nthat the pairing of Theorem 11.2 is also nondegenerate.\nWe still have to prove that Hg,p 6= 0 and for p = 2 is infinite-dimensional.\nWe first describe an element of Hg,p associated to a given realization G \u0592\u2192\nSO(1, 2) as a cocompact lattice,which we will call a principal state.\nRecall that if M is a smooth compact oriented manifold, Dif f 1 (M ) a\ngroup of orientation-preserving diffeomorphism of class C 1 , then one has a\ncocycle l in Z 1 (Dif f 1 (M ), C 0 (M )) defined as [Bott 1]\nl(\u03c6) = log\n\n\u03c6\u2217 \u03bc\n,\n\u03bc\n\nwhere \u03bc is any smooth density on M , and \u03c6\u2217 \u03bc a left action. The class\n[l] \u2208 H 1 (Dif f 1 (M ), C 0 (M )) does not depend on \u03bc. For r \u2265 1 one similarly\ngets a class in H 1 (Dif f r (M ), C r\u22121 (M )). Now, let M = S n\u22121 and consider\na standard conformal action of SO+ (1, n) on S n\u22121 . We get a class\n[l]p \u2208 H 1 (SO + (1, n), Wp(n\u22121)/p (S n\u22121 )/const)\n(n\u22121)/p\n\nfor all p > 1 simply because C \u221e (S n\u22121 ) \u2282 Wp\n(S n\u22121 ). We claim [l]p 6= 0\nfor n = 2 and p > n \u2212 1. Since the action is isometric, it follows from the\nfollowing lemma (we prove and use it only for n = 2).\nLemma 11.8.- Fix z0 \u2208 B n and let r(g) = \u03c1h (z0 , g\u22121 z0 ).

We claim that this section is harmonic. This immediately reduces to a statement that B\u03b2 (z0 , z) is harmonic mod const as a function of z. In the upper half-plane model it simply means that (x, y) 7\u2192 log y\nis harmonic mod const. The harmonic section just defined does not lift to\n(n\u22121)/p\na harmonic section of the flat affine bundle with fiber Wp\n(S n\u22121 ). For\nn = 2 we can say more. Let\nH : Wp1/p (S 1 )/const \u2192 Wp1/p (S 1 )/const\n43\n\n\f1/p\n\nbe the Hilbert transform. It makes Wp (S 1 )/const into a complex Banach\nspace. Then a direct inspection shows that the section of E defined above\nis (anti)holomorphic (depending on the choice of a sign of H). This will\nbe used later. Equivalently, ds is an (anti)-holomorphic one-form on H2 /G,\nvalued in E. Again, this holomorphic form does not lift to a d and \u03b4-closed\n1/p\nform of a flat bundle with fiber Wp (S 1 ) even for p = 2. This latter bundle\nis a flat bundle with fiber a Hilbert space, but whose monodromy is not\northogonal. The Hodge theory of [Korevaar-Schoen 1] and [Jost 1] does not\napply and in fact not every cohomology class is represented by a d and \u03b4closed form. We will discuss these subtle obstructions to the Hodge theory\nin a sequel to this paper [\nReznikov 10].\nAs an application of the computation made above, we will complete the\n1/p\nproof of Lemma 5.6 for p > 1.

Our proof obviously does not work in this case.\nWe now start to prove that H2,g is infinite-dimensional. Let M0 , M0\u2032\nbe factors generated by the left (respectively, right) actions of G in l2 (G)\n44\n\n\f[Murray-von Neumann 1]. Notice that H 1 (Gl , l2 (G)) can be viewed as a\ncohomology of a complex\n2\n\nd0\n\nl (G) \u2192\n\n2g\nM\ni=1\n\nd\n\nl2 (G) \u21921 l2 (G)\n\n(\u2217),\n\ncomputed from the standard CW-decomposition of \u03a3g with one zero-dimensional\ncell, 2g one-dimensional cells and one two-dimensional cell. Notice that\nd0 , d1 are given by matrices with entries in Z[G], acting on l2 (G) from the\nleft. Letting \u2206l = d0 d\u22170 + d\u22171 d1 we can view H 1 (G, l2 (G)) as Ker\u2206l . Notice\nthat \u2206l \u2208 M0 . It follows that H 1 (G, l2 (G)) is a module over M0\u2032 . Now, since\nM0 is type II, there is a decomposition\n1/2\n\nW2 (S 1 )/const = H 1 (Gl , l2 (G)) = Ker \u2206l =\n\nm\nM\n\nHm ,\n\nj=1\n\nfor any m \u2265 1 where Hm are isomorphic right G-modules. Since we know\n1/2\nalready that H 1 (Gr , W2 (S 1 )/const) 6= 0, and Hj are all isomorphic, it fol1/2\nlows that H(Gr , Hj ) 6= 0 for all j, therefore dim H 1 (G, W2 (S 1 ))/const \u2265\nm. This finally proves Theorem 11.2.\nThere are natural invariant von Neumann algebras acting in H2,g . Indeed,\nlet M1\u2032 be a double commutant of M0\u2032 in H 1 (G, l2 (G)) = Ker\u2206l and M1\nbe a commutant of M0\u2032 . We could define M1\u2032 as a von Neumann algebra ,\ngenerated by the right action of G in H 1 (G, l2 (G)) and M1 as a commutant of M1\u2032 . It follows that M1 , M1\u2032 do not depend on the choice of the\ncomplex (\u2217) and therefore Mapg,1 = Aut(G) acts in H 1 (G, l2 (G)) leaving M1\u2032 , M1 invariant. Now consider H2,g = H 1 (Gr , H 1 (Gl , l2 (G)). Then\nL\nL2g\n1\n2\n1\n2\nH2,g = Ker \u2206r : 2g\ni=1 H (Gl , l (G)) \u2192\ni=1 H (Gl , l (G)) where a right\nLaplacian is defined exactly as the left one. It follows that H2,g is a module\nover M1 . Let M2 be a double commutant of M1 and M2\u2032 be its commutant.\nWe have proved a following theorem, except for the last statement.\nTheorem 11.9.- There are infinite-dimensional von Neumann algebras M2 , M2\u2032\nacting in H2,g , which are invariant under the action of Mapg . Moreover,\nthere is an involution \u03c4 of H2,g which commutes with the Mapg -action and\npermutes M2 , M2\u2032 .\n45\n\n\fProof.- Everything is already proved except for the last statement. Notice\nthat there is an involution \u03c4 : l2 (G) \u2192 l2 (G) defined by \u03c4 f (g) = f (g\u22121 ).\nA Lyndon-Serre-Hochschild spectral sequence of the extension 1 \u2192 G \u2192\nG\u00d7G \u2192 G \u2192 1 shows that H2,g = H 2 (G\u00d7G, l2 (G)). Let \u03c3 be an involution\nof G \u00d7 G defined by \u03c3(g, h) = (h, g). Then one has \u03c4 [(g, h)v] = (\u03c3(g, h))\u03c4 (v)\nwhere g, h \u2208 G and v \u2208 l2 (G). It follows that \u03c4 induces an involution, which\nwe also call \u03c4 , in H2,g , which obviously commutes with Mapg -action and\npermutes M2 and M2\u2032 . This completes the proof of Theorem 11.9.\nNote that since the unitary representation of G in H 1 (Gl , l2 (G)) =\n1/2\nW2 (S 1 )/const extends to an irreducible representation of P SL2 (R), the\n1/2\ncommutator M1 of G in W2 (S 1 )/const possesses a faithful trace defined\nby\nZ\ntr(a) * Id =\n\ngag \u22121 dg.\n\nP SL2 (R)/G\n\ne2,g be a completion of M1 under the norm tr xx\u2217 .\nProposition 11.10.- Let H\ne 2,g is a Hilbert space and there is a representation\nThen H\ne2,g ),\n\u03c1\u0303 : Mapg \u2192 Aut(H\n\nleaving invariant a nondegenerate form x 7\u2192 tr x2 .\ne2,g is isomorphic to H2,g as Mapg I don't know at the time of writing if H\nmodule.\nWe now turn to the holomorphic realization of H2,g . Fix a realization of\n1/2\nG as a cocompact lattice in SO+ (1, 2), then H2,g = H 1 (G, W2 (S 1 )/const).\n1/2\nRecall that G commutes with the Hilbert transform in W2 (S 1 )/const. Let\nS = H2 /G, then S is a hyperbolic Riemann surface, homeomorphic to \u03a3g .\n1/2\nFor any element w \u2208 H 1 (G, W2 (S 1 )/const) we have by Lemma 11.3 and\nLemma 11.6 a unique harmonic form in a flat Hilbert bundle E with fiber\n1/2\nW2 (S 1 )/const, associated with the action of G.\nUniqueness should be explained. We have a following general fact.\nLemma 11.11.- Let M be a compact Riemannian manifold. \u03c1 : \u03c01 (M ) \u2192\n46\n\n\fO(H) an orthogonal representation in a real Hilbert space, without fixed\nvectors, \u03c9 \u2208 H 1 (\u03c01 (M ), H). Then there at most one harmonic form, \u03c9 \u2208\n\u03a91 (M, E), representing \u03c9.\nProof.- If \u03c91 , \u03c92 are two such forms, then \u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92 is a derivative of a\nharmonic section of M . But standard Bochner vanishing theorem shows that\nsuch section should be self-parallel, so \u03c1 has a fixed vector, a contradiction.\n1/2\nNotice that H makes W2 (S 1 )/const into a complex Hilbert space.\nThen 12 (\u03c9 \u2212 H(\u03c9 \u25e6 J)), where J is a complex structure on S, will be a holomorphic 1-form in E, whereas 12 (\u03c9 +H(\u03c9 \u25e6J)) will be an anti-holomorphic 1\u00b1\nform. Let H2,g\nbe the spaces of holomorphic(respectively, anti-holomorphic)\n1/2\n+ L \u2212\nH2,g . Now, W2 (S 1 )/const is identified\n1-forms in E, then H2,g = H2,g\nwith exact L2 -harmonic 1-forms in the hyperbolic plane H2 , which is isomorphic as a complex Hilbert space ( with a complex structure, defined by\nthe Hodge star operator) to the space of exact L2 -holomorphic 1-form in\n+\nH2 . So any element in H2,g\ndefines a holomorphic 1-form on S valued in a\nbundle with fibers L2 -holomorphic 1-forms on H2 . In other words, let G act\ndiagonally in H2 \u00d7 H2 and\nQ = H2 \u00d7 H2 /G,\n+\nthen we have an L2 holomorphic 2-form on Q. The space H2,g\ntherefore is\n\u2212\n2\nidentified with the space of L holomorphic 2-forms on Q. Similarly, H2,g\nis\n2\nidentified with the space of L holomorphic 1-form on\n\nQ\u2032 = H2 \u00d7 H2 /G,\nwhere H2 is obtained from H2 by reversing the complex structure (i.e. J \u0304 =\n\u2212J). Notice that as complex surfaces, Q and Q\u2032 are not biholomorphic: Q\ncontains a compact curve (the quotient of the diagonal) whereas Q\u2032 does\nnot. We have proved the following:\nTheorem 11.12.(Holomorphic realization of quantum moduli space)- Fix\nan embedding G \u0592\u2192 SO+ (1, 2) as a cocompact surface, then H2,g splits as\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\nH2,g\n\u2295 H2,g\nwhere H2,g\n(respectively, H2,g\n) is identified with a space of L2\n47\n\n\fholomorphic 2-forms on Q = H2 \u00d7 H2 /G (respectively, Q\u2032 = H2 \u00d7 H2 /G).\nMoreover, the splitting is orthogonal with respect to the canonical symmetric\n\u00b1\nscalar product in H2,g and the restriction of this scalar product on H2,g\nis\npositive (respectively, negative).\n\u2212\nExample.- The principal state [l]2 lies in H2,g\n.

It follows that an operator, associated with\nv1 \u2212 v2 is zero. We are going to show that v1 \u2212 v2 is zero. Since\nv1 \u2212 v2 \u2208 H 1 (Gr , V ),\n1/2\n\nwhere V stands for H 1 (Gl , l2 (G)) \u2243 W2 (S 1 )/const, by a result of [KorevaarSchoen 1] cited above (Lemma 11.6) there exists a harmonic section F of\nthe affine Hilbert bundle over M = H2 /G with fiber V and nonodromy\ng 7\u2192 Rg (*) + m(g),\n\n1/r \u2032\n\nwhere m(g) is any cocycle, representing v1 \u2212 v2 . Let v \u2208 Wr\u2032 (S 1 )/const,\nf = H2 , we see that\nthen, denoting by F again the lift of this section on M\n< F, v > is a harmonic function such that\nZ\n\u2032\n|\u2207(< F, v >)|q d\u03bch < \u221e,\nH2\n\nand the trace of < F, v > on S 1 is constant. It follows that < F, v > is\nconstant itself, therefore (v is arbitrary!) F = w = const and\nm(g) = Rg w \u2212 w,\n53\n\n\fso v1 \u2212 v2 = 0. This proves A. Now, if \u03c6 \u2208 Mapg,1 = Aut(\u03c01 (\u03a3g )), simply\napply A to i1 and i1 \u25e6 \u03c6.\nWe wish to compute v.

The latter function is\na real part of 2 log(1 \u2212 w\u0304z) which is holomorphic in |z| \u2264 1, so the Hilbert\ntransform is 2Arg(1 \u2212 w\u0304\u03b2). This means that a cocycle\nm(g)(\u03b2) = 2Arg(W \u2212 \u03b2) ( mod const)\nwhere W = 1/w\u0304, w = g(0), represents v.\nTheorem 12.6.- H 1 (Mapg,1 , H 1 (Gl , lp (G))) 6= 0 for p \u2265 2.\nProof.- We embed G as a lattice in SO+ (1, 2) and identify H 1 (Gl , lp (G))\n1/p\nand Wp (S 1 )/const.

In other words, fix one lattice embedding\n\u03b20 : G \u2192 SO + (1, 2).\nThen any other lattice embedding\n\u03b2 : G \u2192 SO + (1, 2)\ncan be written as\n\u03b2(g) = \u03a6\u03b20,\u03b2 \u03b20 (g)\u03a6\u22121\n\u03b20 ,\u03b2 ,\nwhere \u03a6\u03b20 ,\u03b2 \u2208 G1 is a quasisymmetric map.

First, one embeds T6g\u22126 in the universal Teichm\u00fcller space\nT = G1 /SO + (1, 2).\nThen using the representation\n1/2\n\nG1 \u2192 Sp(W2 (S 1 )/const)\n56\n\n\fdefined in section 7, one defines an embedding to Sp/U :\n1/2\n\nT \u2192 Sp(W2 (S 1 )/const)/U\nwhere U is a group of operator in Sp which commutes with H seen as a\n1/2\ncomplex structure in W2 (S 1 )/const. Finally, one uses the Cartan embedding\nSp/U \u2192 Sp.\nTheorem 13.2.(Linearization of pseudoAnosov automorphisms )- Let \u03c6 \u2208\nMapg,1 = Aut(\u03c01 (\u03a3g )) is a pseudoAnosov automorphism.

Knowing Sp is\nessentially equivalent to knowing the hyperbolic volumes of all ideal simplices\nwith vertices on the limit curve S 1 \u2192 S 2 .\n\n57\n\n\f58\n\n\fChapter 2\n\nA theory of groups acting on\nthe circle\nOur first main result in this Chapter is Theorem 1.7 which says, roughly,\nthat Kazhdan group cannot act on the circle. This general theorem draws\na line after many years of study and various special results concerning the\nactions of lattices in Lie groups, see [Witte 1], [Farb-Shalen 1], [Ghys 1].\nOne can see here a historic parallel with a similar, but easier, general theorem of [Alperin 1] and [Watatani 1] concerning Kazhdan groups acting on\ntrees, which also followed a study of the actions of lattices. Our technique\nis absolutely different from the cited papers and uses a fundamental cocycle, introduced and studied in section 1. We also use standard facts from\nKazhdan groups theory [de la Harpe-Valette 1].\nIn Sections 2,3 we quantize equivariant maps between boundaries of universal covers, studied in Chapter I, Section 6. Our main tool is a harmonic\nmap theory into infinite-dimensional spaces, as developed in [KorevaarSchoen 1], see also [Jost 1]. In Section 4 we review some facts about\nBanach-Lie groups and regulators. In Section 5 we describe a series of higher\ncharacteristic classes of subgroups of Dif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 ). There are two construction given. One uses an extension to a restricted linear group of a Hilbert\nspace of classes originally defined in [Feigin-Tsygan 1] for infinite Jacobian\nmatrices. Another construction uses the action of a restricted symplectic\n59\n\n\f1/2\n\ngroup Sp(W2 (S 1 )/const) on the infinite-dimensional Siegel half-plane. In\nboth construction we use an embedding of Dif f 1,\u03b1 into a restricted linear\ngroup, by the unitary and symplectic representation of Dif f , respectively.\nUsing the geometry of the Siegel half-plane, we prove that our classes have\npolynomial growth.\nThere is a striking similarity between the theory of this Chapter and\na theory of symplectomorphism group, see Chapter IV, [Reznikov 2] and\n[Reznikov 4]. Note that the extended mapping class group action is not\nC 1,\u03b1 smooth, so the results of this Chapter do not apply to this group.\nOn the other hand, Mapg does act symplectically on a smooth compact\nsymplectic manifold.\n\n2.1\n\nFundamental cocycle\n\nBy Dif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 ) we denote a group of orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms\nwith derivative in the H\u00f6lder space C \u03b1 (S 1 ), which consists of functions f\nsuch that\n|f (x) \u2212 f (y)| < c|x \u2212 y|\u03b1 .\nThere is a series of unitary representations of Dif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 ) in L2C (S 1 , d\u03b8)\ngiven by\n1\n\n(\u03c0(g)(f ))(x) = f (g\u22121 x) * [(g \u22121 )\u2032 (x)] 2 +i\u03b2 ,\n\n\u03b2 \u2208 R.\n\nWe will mostly consider \u03b2 = 0, in which case one has an orthogonal\nrepresentation in L2R (S 1 , d\u03b8). An invariant meaning is, of course a representation in half-densities on S 1 .

This proves A.\nTo prove B we notice that by [Pietsch 1], the estimate on the kernel\nimplies that the operator lies in J1/\u03b1+ . Strictly speaking, the conditions of\n[Pietsch 1] require C \u221e smoothness off the diagonal, whereas we have only\nthe H\u00f6lder continuity, but the result stays true.\nNow notice that GL(L2 (S 1 , d\u03b8)) acts in Jp by conjugation. We deduce\nthe following\nProposition 1.2.- A map\nl : g 7\u2192 \u03c0(g)H\u03c0(g\u22121 ) \u2212 H\nis a 1-cocycle of Dif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 ) in Jp (L2 (S 1 , d\u03b8)) for p > 1/\u03b1. In particular, l\nis a 1-cocycle of Dif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 ) in J2 for \u03b1 > 1/2.\nWe will call l a fundamental cocycle of Dif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 ).\nNow let G be a subgroup of Dif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 ). We obtain a class in H 1 (G, Jp (L2 (S 1 , d\u03b8))\nby restricting l on G. We are going to show that this class is never zero,\nexcept for completely pathological actions of G on S 1 .\nProposition 1.3.- Let G be a subgroup of Dif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 ), 0 < \u03b1 < 1. Suppose\np > 1/\u03b1. If [l] \u2208 H 1 (G, Jp ) zero, then the unitary action of G in L2C (S 1 , d\u03b8)\nis reducible. Moreover, if H 1 (G, Jp ) = 0 then L2C (S 1 , d\u03b8) a direct sum of\ncountably many closed invariant subspaces.\nProof.- If [l] = 0 then there is A \u2208 Jp such that\n\u03c0(g)H\u03c0(g\u22121 ) \u2212 H = \u03c0(g)A\u03c0(g\u22121 ) \u2212 A\nso that [\u03c0(g), H \u2212 A] = 0. Since H has two different eigenvalues with\ninfinitely-dimensional eigenspaces, H \u2212 A 6= const * Id, so the action of G in\nL2C (S 1 , d\u03b8) is reducible.\nNext, consider an operator R in L2 (S 1 , d\u03b8) with a kernel\nK(\u03c6, \u03b7) =\n\n1\n|tg\n\n62\n\n\u03c6\u2212\u03b7 .\n2 |\n\n\fOne sees immediately that R is a self-adjoint unbounded operator. Repeating the computation above, we deduce that \u03c0(g)R\u03c0(g\u22121 ) \u2212 R \u2208 Jp , so\n \u0303l(g) = \u03c0(g)R\u03c0(g \u22121 ) \u2212 R is another cocycle. If this cocycle is trivial, then\nwe get an unbounded self-adjoint operator R \u2212 A which commutes with the\naction of G. An application of the spectral theorem shows that L2 (S 1 , d\u03b8)\nis a countable sum of invariant subspaces.\nCorollary 1.4.- A restriction of l,  \u0303l on SO + (1, 2) is not zero, for all \u03b1 > 0.\nProof.- SO + (1, 2) act in L2C (S 1 , d\u03b8) as a representation of principal series,\nwhich are irreducible.\nWe now specialize for \u03b1 = 1/2 and p = 2. Since [ \u0303l] \u2208 H 1 (SO + (1, 2), J2 )\nis nonzero, k \u0303l(g)kJ2 is unbounded as a function of g [de la Harpe-Valette 1].\nIn fact, one has the following\nProposition 1.5.- Let \u03c0 : SO+ (1, 2) \u2192 U (H) be a unitary representation\nand let l : SO + (1, 2) \u2192 H be a continuous cocycle. Suppose [l] 6= 0. Then\nA. For any cocompact lattice G \u2282 SO+ (1, 2), [l]|G 6= 0.\nB. kl(gn )k is unbounded as n \u2192 \u221e for any hyperbolic g.\nC. kl(\u03b3 n )k is unbounded as n \u2192 \u221e for any parabolic \u03b3 6= 1.\nProof.- Let V \u2282 SO + (1, 2) be compact and such that V * G = SO+ (1, 2).\nFor v \u2208 V, g \u2208 G we have\nl(vg) = \u03c0(v)l(g) + l(v),\nso kl(vg)k \u2264 kl(g)k + kl(v)k. If l|G is bounded, then so is l. This proves A.\nNext, let P be the image of SO+ (1, 2)/K under Cartan embedding, where\nK is a maximal compact subgroup. By the same reason as above, l|P is\nunbounded. Let S 1 \u2282 P be a nontrivial orbit of K in P \u2248 H2 . Notice\nthat P is closed under raising into an integral power and there is a compact\n63\n\n\fV \u2282 SO+ (1, 2) such that\nP \u2286\n\n[\n\n(S 1 )n * V\n\nn\u22651\n\nwhere (S 1 )n is an image of S 1 under raising to n-th power. We deduce that\nl| \u222an\u22651 (S 1 )n is unbounded. Let \u03b3 \u2208 S 1 . Then any element in (S 1 )n is of\nthe form k\u03b3 n k\u22121 , k \u2208 K, so\nkl(k\u03b3 n k\u22121 )k \u2264 kl(k)k + kl(k\u22121 )k + kl(\u03b3 n )k\nSo kl(\u03b3 n )k is unbounded. Since \u03b3 can be any hyperbolic element, B follows.\nNotice that we proved that kl(gk )k is unbounded for any sequence gk \u2208 P ,\nwhich escapes all compact sets. Now let g \u2208 SO + (1, 2) be parabolic 6= 1,\nand let \u03c4 be the involution fixing K. Then \u03c4 (gn ) * g\u2212n \u2208 P and escapes all\ncompact sets, so kl[(\u03c4 gn )*g\u2212n ]k is unbounded. It follows that either kl(\u03c4 gn )k\nor kl(g\u2212n )k is unbounded. But all parabolics are conjugate in SO+ (1, 2), so\nC follows.\nProposition 1.6.- Let G \u2282 Dif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 ), \u03b1 > 1/2. Suppose that G contains an element g which is conjugate in Dif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 ) to a hyperbolic or\na nontrivial parabolic fractional-linear transformation. Then [l]|G 6= 0 in\nH 1 (G, J2 ).\nProof.- Any such g is conjugate in Dif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 ) to an element g \u2032 \u2208 SO + (1, 2)\nfor which kl(g\u2032 n )k is unbounded, so kl(g n )k is unbounded as well.\nWe are ready to formulate the main result of this section.\nTheorem 1.7.- Let G \u2282 Dif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 ), \u03b1 > 1/2.

So for \u03c8 \u2208 C \u221e (S 1 ),\nZ\n(\u03c1 \u2212 H)\u03c8 \u2208 J2 ,\nS1\n\n66\n\n\fwhich proves the Theorem.\nRemarks.- 1)As was mentioned above, the invariant meaning of the representation \u03c0 is that L2 (S 1 , d\u03b8) should be regarded as a space of half-densities.\nCorrespondingly, an integral operator is defined by a kernel which is a halfdensity on S 1 \u00d7 S 1 of the type K(\u03c6, \u03b7)(d\u03c6d\u03b7)1/2 . If K(\u03c6, \u03b7) is smooth and\nhas a zero of second order on the diagonal \u2206 \u2282 S 1 \u00d7 S 1 , then one has an\ninvariant definition of its residue or second derivative, which is a quadratic\ndifferential. A direct computation which we leave to the reader shows that\nfor g \u2208 Dif f \u221e(S 1 )\n: 1) l(g) = \u03c0(g)H\u03c0(g \u22121 ) \u2212 H is given by a kernel which has a zero of second\norder on \u2206;\n2) a corresponding residue S(g) is the Schwartzian of g.\nThis shows that l(g) is a quantization of the Schwartzian cocycle. The\noperator field \u03c1(s) of Theorem 1.8 seems therefore to be related to objects\naxiomatized, but not constructed, in [Belavin-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov 1].\n2)The Theorem and the proof stay valid for any representation\n\u03c6 : G \u2192 Dif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 ),\n\u03b1 > 1/2, such that the action on S 1 \u00d7 S 1 satisfies the very mild conditions\nof Lemma I.11.3.\n\n2.3\n\nConstruction of N = 3 quantum fields with\nlattice symmetry\n\nA theory developed have for Dif f (S 1 ) does not generalize to Dif f (S n ), n \u2265\n2. The reason is that the action of Dif f (S 1 ) on S 1 is conformal. There are\ntwo ways to generalize various aspects of the theory to higher dimensions, by\neither considering SO + (1, n) acting on S n\u22121 or, very surprisingly, a group\nof symplectomorphisms of a compact symplectic manifold M (see Chapter\nIV). Here we consider the action of SO + (1, 3) \u2243 P SL2 (C) on S 2 . We set\nd(x, y) to be a spherical distance in S 2 . Let d\u03b8 denote the spherical measure\nand let H = L2 (S 2 , d\u03b8). For g \u2208 SO+ (1, 3) let \u03bcg (x) denote a conformal\n67\n\n\ffactor, that is \u03bc2g (x) is a Jacobian of g with respect to d\u03b8. A formula\n\u03c0(g)f (x) = f (g \u22121 (x)) * \u03bc1+i\u03b2\n(x),\ng \u22121\n\n\u03b2 \u2208 R,\n\ndefines a unitary representation of SO + (1, 3) in H. Now we introduce an\noperator H with the kernel\nK(\u03c6, \u03b8) =\n\n1\nd2 (\u03c6, \u03b7)\n\n.\n\nThis operator is self-adjoint and unbounded. Our goal is to compute\n\u03c0(g)H\u03c0(g\u22121 ) \u2212 H = l(g).\nProposition 3.1.- l(g) \u2208 J2 for all g \u2208 SO + (1, 3) and \u03b2 = 0.\nProof.- A direct computation. One needs to show that as d(x, y) \u2192 0,\nd2 (g(x), g(y)) \u2212 \u03bcg (x)\u03bcg (y)d2 (x, y)\nis of order d4 (x, y). In other words, for a fractional-linear trangformation g\nof C one needs to show that as x \u2192 y, Im x, Im y > 0, g(x) = x,\ng(x) \u2212 g(y)\n\ng(x) \u2212 g(y)\n\n2\n\nIm y x \u2212 y\n\u2212 |g (x)||g (y)|\nIm g(y) x \u2212 \u0233\n\u2032\n\n2\n\n\u2032\n\nis of order |x \u2212 y|4 . This verifies the result for hyperbolic metric instead of\nspherical metric, which is of course equivalent. One computes directly using\nTaylor series for holomorphic function g.\nNow arguing as in section 2 we arrive at the following result.\nTheorem 3.2.- Let G be a cocompact lattice in SO+ (1, 3). Let H =\nL2R (S 2 , d\u03b8) with orthogonal action of G corresponding to \u03b2 = 0. Then\nthere exists a harmonic map\n\u03c8\n\nH3 \u2192 J2 (H)\n68\n\n\fwith the property that z 7\u2192 \u03c8(z) + H is equivariant:\n\u03c8(gz) + H = \u03c0(g)(\u03c8(z) + H)\u03c0(g \u22121 )\nfor all g \u2208 G and z \u2208 H3 .\n\nSince H is unbounded, the boundary value of \u03c8(z)+H does not exist as a\nmeasurable map to the space of bounded operators. It is possible that there\nis a more clever choice of a conformally natural singular integral operator\nwhich is bounded, but I don't know how to do it. Note in this respect\nthat there is a very different realization of an orthogonal representation\nof SO + (1, 3) in the space of functions on S 2 , discovered in [Reznikov 1].\nNamely, look at the natural action of SO+ (1, 3) on smooth half co-densities,\n\u221a\nthat is, sections of \u039b2 T S 2 . Using the spherical metric, we can identify\nthis space with C \u221e (S 2 ). Then the above-mentioned action leaves invariant\na nonnegative quadratic form\nZ\n((\u2206f )2 \u2212 2|\u2207f |2 )darea\nQ(f ) =\nS2\n\nwhose kernel consists of constants and linear functions. It is possible that\nthere are G-equivariant quantum fields valued in operators acting in the\nassociated Hilbert space.\n\n2.4\n\nBanach-Lie groups and regulators: an overview\n\nA Banach-Lie group is a Banach manifold with a compatible group structure.\nUsual Lie theory largely extends to this case. In particular, if G is a BanachLie group and g its Banach-Lie algebra, then a continuous n-cocycle on g\ndefines a left-invariant closed form on G, so that one has a homomorphism\nn\nn\nHcont\n(g, K) \u2192 Htop\n(G, K)\n\u2217 is a cohomology of a topological space. In [Reznikov 2] we defined\nwhere Htop\nK-homotopy groups of a Lie algebra, so that there is a map\n\n\u03c0i (G) \u2297 K \u2192 \u03c0i (g)\n69\n\n\fwhich in the case G = SLn (C \u221e (M )), M a compact manifold, n >> 1,\nreduces to the Chern character\nKitop (M ) \u2192 HCi (C \u221e (M )) = \u03a9i (M )/d\u03a9i\u22121 (M ) \u2295 H i\u22122 (M, K) \u2295 * * *\n(G is not a Banach-Lie group but a Frech\u00e9t-Lie group in this case). More\ninteresting is a secondary class (=regulator) map. Define an algebraic Ktheory of G as\nKialg (G) = \u03c0i ((BG \u03b4 )+ )\nand the augmented K-theory as a kernel of the map Kialg \u2192 Kitop :\nalg\n\n0 \u2192 K i (G) \u2192 Kialg (G) \u2192 \u03c0i (BG) = \u03c0i\u22121 (G).\nThen the regulator map is a homomorphism\nalg\n\nr : K i (G) \u2192 coker(\u03c0i (G) \u2297 K \u2192 \u03c0i (g)).\nLifting this map to cohomology, that is , constructing a map\n\u2217\nHcont\n(g, K) \u2192 H \u2217 (G \u03b4 , K)\n\nmeets obstructions described in the van Est spectral sequence. If K \u2282 G\nis a closed subgroup such that G/K is contractible, then these obstructions\nvanish and one gets a map\n\u2217\nHcont\n(g, k) \u2192 H \u2217 (G \u03b4 )\n\ngiven explicitly by a Dupont-type construction [Dupont 1]. This is essentially the same as geometric construction of secondary classes of flat Gbundles, described in [Reznikov 3]. In case G = SLn (C \u221e (M )) this gives a\nusual regulator map in algebraic K-theory. However, for various diffeomorphism groups one construct new interesting classes. For symplectomorphism\ngroups two series of classes, mentioned in the Introduction to Chapter 4,\nwere constructed in [Reznikov 2] and [Reznikov 4], and a new class associated to a Lagrangian submanifold, will be constructed in Chapter 4. The\nsymmetric spaces for Sympl(M ), used in [Reznikov 2] are sort of continuous direct products of finite-dimensional Siegel upper half-planes. On the\n70\n\n\fother hand, a symmetric space which we will use in this chapter to construct\nclasses in H \u2217 (Dif f 1,\u03b1 (S 1 )) is an infinite-dimensional Siegel half-plane. The\ntrouble is, however, that, for a compact manifold Y , (say, S 1 ) a group of\ndiffeomorphisms of finite smoothness, like Dif f k (Y ), is not a Banach-Lie\ngroup: the multiplication from the right is not a diffeomorphism (the multiplication from the left is). This is neatly explained in [Adams-Ratiu-Schmid\n1]. Luckily, to construct secondary classes we only use the fact that the\nmultiplication from the left is a diffeomorphism.\n\n2.5\n\nCharateristic classes of foliated circle bundles\n\nAs is well known, the continuous cohomology of Dif f \u221e(S 1 ) is generated by\nthe Euler class and by the integrated Godbillon-Vey class [Geldfand-Fuks\n1], [Fuks 1 and references therein]. Moreover, the square of the Euler class\nis zero. This already shows that the degree of smoothness is crucial. For if\none considers the action of the extended mapping class group\nMapg,1 \u0592\u2192 G1 \u0592\u2192 Homeo(S 1 ),\nthen the pull-back of the Euler class has nonzero powers to a degree which\ngoes to infinity with g [Miller 1], [Morita 1], [Mumford 1]. It appears that\nthe scarcity of the cohomology of Dif f (S 1 ) is a consequence of an (artificial)\nrestriction of excessive degree of smoothness. Notice that the proofs in [Fuks\n1] depend hopelessly on C \u221e - smoothness. We will give two constructions\nof a series of new classes in H \u2217 (Dif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 )), 0 < \u03b1 < 1 using both the\nunitary representation in L2 (S 1 , d\u03b8) and the symplectic representation in\n1/2\nSp(W2 (S 1 )/const). As in the case of the powers of the Euler class, a\nnonvanishing of these classes is an obstruction to smoothability, i.e. to\na conjugation to a subgroup of Dif f \u221e(S 1 ). We will also prove that our\nclasses are of polynomial growth if \u03b1 > 1/2. A related result (but not\nthe argument) for C \u221e Gelfand-Fuks cohomology in all dimensions is to be\nfound in [Connes-Gromov-Moscovici 1]. Both in spirit and technology, the\nconstruction of the classes in H \u2217 (Dif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 )) resembles our construction\nk (Sympl(M ), R), k = 2, 6, 10, * * * , where M is\nof a series of classes in Hcont\n71\n\n\fa compact symplectic manifold and Sympl(M ) is its symplectomorphism\ngroup [Reznikov 4].\nWe start with the construction using the unitary representation. By\nProposition 1.1, \u03c0(g)H\u03c0(g \u22121 ) \u2212 H \u2208 Jp where g \u2208 Dif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 ), p > 1/\u03b1,\n\u03c0 is a unitary action in L2C (S 1 , d\u03b8), and H is a complexification of the Hilbert\ntransform. That is H(ein\u03b8 ) = sgn(n) * ein\u03b8 . The group of \u03a6 \u2208 GL(H), H =\nL2C (S 1 , d\u03b8) such that \u03a6H\u03a6\u22121 \u2212 H \u2208 Jp will be denoted GLJp (H), following\n[Pressley-Segal 1]. The unitary subgroup of GLJp (H) is denoted UJp (H). Let\nH+ , H\u2212 be the eigenspaces of H with eigenvalues +1 and \u22121 respectively.\nBy GrJp (H) we denote the restricted Grassmanian UJp /U (H+ ) \u00d7 U (H\u2212 ).\nThen GrJp (H) is a Banach manifold, modelled by the Banach space Jp . The\nBanach-Lie group GLJp (H) acts smoothly on GrJp (H). On the other hand,\nthough Dif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 ) is a group and a Banach manifold, it is not a BanachLie group [Adams-Ratiu-Schmid 1]. However, multiplication from the left\nLg (h) = gh is a diffeomorphism (but not a multiplication from the right).\nThe embedding\nDif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 ) \u2192 UJp \u2192 GLJp (H)\nis not continuous. However, an induced action of Dif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 ) on GrJp (H)\nis smooth [Pressley-Segal 1].\nWe will introduce a series of UJp -invariant differential forms on GrJp (H).\nThese forms induce cohomology classes in the Lie algebra cohomology H \u2217 (Lie(UJp )),\nextending the classes introduced in [Feigin-Tsygan 1] for the Lie algebra of\nJacobian matrices. Notice that a tangent space to the origin of GrJp (H) can\nbe identified with matrices of the form\n!\n0 B\nC=\nA 0\nwhere A \u2208 Jp (H+ , H\u2212 ) and B \u2208 Jp (H\u2212 , H+ ). Let C1 , * * * , C2k , (k odd)\nbe a collection of such matrices. Define\nX\nsgn(\u03c3)Pk (\u03c1(C\u03c3(1) , C\u03c3(2) ), * * * , \u03c1(C\u03c3(2k\u22121) , C\u03c3(2k) )\n\u03bck (C1 , * * * , C2k ) =\n\u03c3\u2208S2k\n\nwhere Pk is the k-th invariant symmetric functions of k matrices, which\nis a polarization of tr Ak (not an elementary symmetric polynomial, as in\n72\n\n\f[Fuks 1] ). Now, \u03c1(C1 , C2 ) is defined as follows: let \u03c0(C) is the left upper\ncorner of C, i.e. an operator in B(H+ ). Then \u03c1(C1 , C2 ) = \u03c0([C1 , C2 ]) \u2212\n[\u03c0(C1 ), \u03c0(C2 )]. The \"meaning\" of \u03c0 is that of a connection of a principal\nbundle on something like the classifying space of the Lie algebra Lie(GLJp ),\nand of \u03c1 is that of the curvature of this connection. Then \u03bck becomes a\ncharacteristic class, somewhat analogous to the characteristic classes in the\nstandard Chern-Weil theory. Notice that \u03bck is defined for all k \u2265 [1/\u03b1] + 1.\nIn [Feigin-Tsygan 1], \u03c1(C1 , C2 ) \u2208 gl(\u221e, K) and \u03bck is defined for all k. The\nform \u03bc2 defines the famous \"Japanese cocycle\", [Verdier 1].\nLemma 5.1.- \u03bck is UJp -invariant and closed.\nProof.- The invariance is obvious. The proof of closedness is standard and\nleft to the reader, see the remarks above and [Feigin-Tsygan 1].\nPulling back to Dif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 ) (this is possible by the remarks made above)\nwe obtain a left-invariant closed differential form on Dif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 ). Pulling\n1,\u03b1\nback to the universal cover ^\nDif f (S 1 ), we obtain a left-invariant closed\n1,\u03b1\n\n^\ndifferential form \u03bc\u0303k on Dif\nf\n\n(S 1 ). A following theorem follows.\n\nTheorem 5.2.- The secondary characteristic class, corresponding to \u03bc\u0303k is a\n1,\u03b1\nwell-defined class r(\u03bc\u0303k ) in H 2k ([^\nDif f ]\u03b4 , R).\n1,\u03b1\n\n^\nProof.- Dif\nf\n\n(S 1 ) is contractible.\n\nNotice that for \u03b1 > 1/2 the class \u03bc1 \u2208 H 2 (Dif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 )) is defined, which\nis just the integrated Godbillon-Vey class.\nOur second construction uses the symplectic action. For simplicity, we\nonly treat the case \u03b1 > 1/2. Recall (Corollary I.7.3) that G1 acts symplec1/2\ntically in V = W2 (S 1 )/const. Restricting on Dif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 ), we obtain a\nrepresentation\n\u03c0\n\nDif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 ) \u2192 Sp(V ).\nLet H be the Hilbert transform in V , normalized such that H 2 = \u22121. Denote\n73\n\n\fby SpJp a subgroup of A \u2208 Sp(V ) such that [A, H] \u2208 Jp . Denote U = U (V )\nthe unitary group of such A that [A, H] = 0. Denote\nX = SpJp /U\na restricted Siegel half-plane. This is a Banach contractible manifold [Palais\n1]. For p = 2 this is a Hilbert manifold with canonical SpJ2 -invariant\nRiemannian metric of nonpositive curvature. The metric is defined as follows. The tangent space TH (X) is identified with operators A such that\nA \u2208 Lie(SpJ2 ) and AH = \u2212HA. It follows that A \u2208 J2 , and A = A\u2217 . Then\nthe metric is defined as trA2 . This definition is dimension-free and so the\nproof that the curvature is nonpositive follows from the explicit formulae,\nas in finitely-dimentional case.\nLemma 5.3.- For \u03b1 > 1/2, \u03c0(Dif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 )) \u2282 SpJ2 (V ).\nProof.- We will use the computation of [Segal 1]. Let g \u2208 Dif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 ). We\nneed to show that\n2\nX m Z\nS=\nei(ng(\u03b8)+m\u03b8) d\u03b8 < \u221e.\nn S1\nn,m>0\n\nAs in [Segal 1] we have, using a trick of Kazhdan,\nS=\n\nZ\n\u22121\n\u221e N\nX\nX\nm\n\nN =1 m=1\n\nn\n\n2\n\nS1\n\neiN \u03c6 * [g\u03b2\u22121 ]\u2032 (\u03c6)d\u03c6 ,\n\nn\n, n = N \u2212 m, g\u03b2 (\u03b8) = \u03b2g(\u03b8) + (1 \u2212 \u03b2)\u03b8, \u03b8 \u2208 S 1 = R/2\u03c0Z.

All these classes are of polynomial growth.\nProof.- Only the last statement needs a proof. For x0 , * * * , xs \u2208 X denote\na geodesic span \u03c3(x0 , * * * , xs ) in the following inductive way: \u03c3(x0 , x1 ) is a\ngeodesic segment joining x0 and x1 and \u03c3(x0 , * * * , xs ) is a union of geodesic\nsegments joining x0 and points of \u03c3(x1 , * * * , xs ).

Since \u03bdk is uniformly bounded, the\nresult follows.\nWe will give an independent proof of polynomial growth of \u03bc2 \u2208 H 2 (Dif f 1,1 (S 1 )).\nLet V ar(S 1 ) be a space of functions of bounded variation on S 1 mod constants.

For \u03bc2 as a class in H 2 (Dif f \u221e(S 1 ))\nsee also [Connes-Gromov-Moscovici 1].\n\n2.6\n\nExamples\n\nA typical example of a group in Dif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 ) is a following one. Let K \u2282 R\nbe a subfield (i.e., a number field). By S 1 (K) denote K-rational points of\nS 1 \u2282 R2 . Define GK as a group of C 1 -diffeomorphism g such that there are\npoints x0 , * * * , xn = x0 \u2208 S 1 (K) in this order such that gk = g[xk ,xk+1] is a\nrestriction of an element of P SL2 (K). The C 1 -condition simply means that\n\u2032\n(xk+1 ). Then automatically GK \u2282 Dif f 1,1 (S 1 ). Groups\ngk\u2032 (xk+1 ) = gk+1\nof this type, or rather their obvious analogues which act by piecewiseaffine transformations on S 1 viewed as R/Z appeared in [Thompson 1],\n[Greenberg-Sergiesku 1,2], [Brown-Georghegan 1], etc. where various properties were studied. The \"proper\" Thompson group can be smoothed , that\nis, embedded in Dif f (S 1 ) [Ghys-Sergiesku 1] so that the Theorem 1.7 applies. However, it also acts on a tree so it is not Kazhdan already by a\nresult of [Alperin 1], [Watatani 1]. Generally, subgroups of Dif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 ) like\ndescribed above, do not have any obvious action on a tree and one needs\nour Theorem 1.7 to show that they are not Kazhdan. A parallel theorem\nfor symplectomorphism groups will be given in Chapter IV. Notice also that\nthe proof that our characteristic classes constructed in Section 5 are in polynomial cohomology agrees with a recent result on the growth of the Dehn\nfunction of the Thompson group [Guba 1].\n\n76\n\n\fChapter 3\n\nGeometry of unitary cocycles\nIn this Chapter we return to the asymptotic geometry of finitely generated\ngroups. If G is not Kazhdan, then an orthogonal cocycle l \u2208 Z 1 (G, H)\nshould be viewed as a way to linearize the geometry of G. Our first result\nis a convexity theorem 2.1 which says that the embedding of G into the\nHilbert space H given by l coarsely respects the geometry in a sense that\ninner points of big \"domains\" in G are mapped inside the convex hull of the\nimage of boundary points.\nWe have seen in Chapter I that primitive functions F : G \u2192 R of cocycles\nin Z 1 (G, lp (G)) of a surface group satisfy\n|F(g)| < c * length(g)1/p\n\n\u2032\n\nHere, we start a general study of cocycle growth. We show in Theorem 3.1\nthat for any orthogonal cocycle l : G \u2192 H,\nkl(g)k < c(\u03b8)[length(g) log log length(g)]1/2\nfor almost all \u03b8 \u2208 \u2202G \u2243 S 1 and g \u2192 \u03b8 nontangentially. We use in proof an\nadjusted version of Makarov's law of iterated logarithm. The result extends\nto all complex hyperbolic cocompact lattices of any dimension.\nUsing another deep result of Makarov, we show the following in Proposition 3.3. Let G be a surface group, \u03b2 : G \u2192 Z a surjective homomorphism\nand G0 = Ker\u03b2. Then the conical limit set of G0 has Hausdorff dimension\n77\n\n\f1, in particular, the exponent \u03b4(G0 ) = 1. We do not know if this set has a\nfull Lebesgue measure ( it is certainly a doable problem).\nNotice that the proof of Lemma I.11.8 shows that the estimate on kl(g)k\nis essentially sharp. It also shows that this estimate does not hold in other\nBanach spaces. However, imposing various restricitons on a Banach space,\none still hopes to get an estimate, reflecting a fine structure of G.\n\n3.1\n\nSmooth and combinatorial harmonic sections\n\nLet G be a finitely generated group. \u03c0 : G \u2192 O(H) an orthogonal representation without almost invariant vectors and l : G \u2192 H a nontrivial cocycle.\nIf M is a compact Riemannian manifold with \u03c01 (M ) = G (so that G is\nfinitely presented) then one forms a flat affine bundle E over M with fiber\nH and monodromy\ng 7\u2192 (v 7\u2192 \u03c0(g)v + l(g))\nA result of [Korevaar-Schoen 1] and [Jost 1] (Lemma I.11.6) states that\nthere is a harmonic section f of E. If M is K\u00e4hler then there is another\ncocycle m : G \u2192 H so that a complex affine bundle with fiber E \u2297 C and\nmonodromy\ng 7\u2192 (v + iw 7\u2192 \u03c0(g)v + i\u03c0(g)w + l(g) + im(g))\nadmits a holomorphic section. Our first result is a combinatorial version of\nthis theorem.\nLet {\u03b3i } be a finite set of generators for G. Let V be a space of \"sections\",\nthat is, G-equivariant maps\nf : G \u2192 H.\nThis simply means that f (g \u22121 x) = \u03c0(g)f (x) + l(g). Obviously, such map is\ndetermined by f (1) \u2208 H. Therefore, V \u2248 H. A combinatorial Laplacian is\ndefined as\nX\n\u25b3f (x) =\nf (\u03b3i x) + f (\u03b3i\u22121 x) \u2212 2f (x).\ni\n\nProposition 2.1.- There exists an equivariant f : G \u2192 H with \u25b3f = 0.\n78\n\n\fProof.- Let v = f (1), then f (x\u22121 ) = xv + l(x).

Therefore,\n0 \u2208 spec(\u25b3),\ne is invertible and the result follows.\n\u25b3\n\n3.2\n\nA convexity theorem\n\nWe keep the notation of 3.1. Any cocycle l : G \u2192 H can be seen as an\nembedding of G in the Hilbert space. If kl(g)k \u2192 \u221e as length(g) \u2192 \u221e, then\nthis embedding is uniform in the sense that kl(g)\u2212l(h)k \u2192 \u221e as \u03c1(g, h) \u2192 \u221e\nfor any word left-invariant metric on G. For instance, Proposition I.2.1\nimplies that any group G acting discretely (but possibly not cocompactly)\non an Hadamard manifold of pinched negative curvature, admits a uniform\nembedding into lp (G), p > 1. We are, however, interested in a finer geometry\nof the cocycle embeddings.\nFor a finite A \u2282 G and C > 0, a C-interior intC (A) is defined as\n{x|\u03c1(x, y) < C \u21d2 y \u2208 A}. A C-boundary \u2202C (A) is defined as A\\intC (A).\nTheorem 2.2.- Let \u03c0 : G \u2192 O(H) be an orthogonal representation without\nalmost-invariant vectors. Let l : G \u2192 H be a cocycle for \u03c0. Then there are\nconstants C1 , C2 (l) > 0 such that for any finite A \u2282 G and any x \u2208 A,\ndistH (l(x) \u2212 conv(l(\u2202C1 A))) \u2264 C2 .\n79\n\n(\u2217)\n\n\fProof.- Let f : G \u2192 H be an equivariant harmonic map of Proposition 1.1.\nSince kf (x\u22121 ) \u2212 l(x)k = kf (1)k = const, we can replace (\u2217) by a condition\ndistH (f (x) \u2212 convf (\u2202C1 (A)) \u2264 C2\u2032 ,\nwhere however, one uses a right-invariant word metric on G in definition of\n\u2202C (A). This result follows from the maximum principle of harmonic functions. Indeed, let x \u2208 intC1 (A) be such that distH (f (x) \u2212 convf (\u2202C1 (A)))\nis maximal possible (and > C2 )( a choice of C1 , C2 will be made later). Let\nv be a unit vector, such that\n(f (x) \u2212 y, v) = distH (f (x) \u2212 convf (\u2202C1 (A))\nfor some y \u2208 convf (\u2202C1 (A)). Let h(z) = (f (z) \u2212 y, v). Then h(x) > C2 and\ne = 0 and h(z) \u2264 h(x) for z \u2208 intC (A).\nh(\u2202C1 (A)) \u2282 (\u2212\u221e, 0]. Moreover, \u25b3h\n1\nIt follows that h(\u03b3i x) = h(x) for all i. Replacing x by \u03b3i x and continuing\nuntil we hit \u2202C1 A, we arrive to a contradiction with C1 = 2, C2 = 2kf (1)k+1.\n\n3.3\n\nCocycle growth for a surface group\n\nIn this section we continue, for general representations, a subject started in\nI.5.2. Recall that, for any group G, any primitive function F : G \u2192 R of a\nclass in H 1 (G, lp (G)) satisties\n|F(g)| \u2264 const * length(g)\nat least of G is finitely presented. However, if G = \u03c01 (\u03a3), a surface group,\nthen one has much finer estimate, established in Theorem I.5.2:\n\u2032\n\n|F(g)| \u2264 const * length(g)1/p .\nTheorem 3.1.- Let G = \u03c01 (\u03a3) be a surface group. Let \u03c0 : G \u2192 O(H)\nbe an orthogonal representation without almost-invariant vectors and let\nl : G \u2192 H be a cocycle. Then for almost all \u03b8 \u2208 S 1 \u2248 \u2202G,\nkl(g)k \u2264 const(\u03b8)[length(g) * log log length(g)]1/2\n80\n\n(\u2217)\n\n\fas g converges nontangentially to \u03b8. Here \"almost all\" corresponds to a\nLebesgue measure on \u2202G, identified with S 1 under some lattice embedding\nG \u0592\u2192 SO + (1, 2).\nRemark.- Nontangential convergence of points of B 2 to \u03b8 \u2208 \u2202B 2 is an\ninvariant of quasi-conformal homeomorphism [???]. Therefore (\u2217) is Mapg,1 invariant. Let A \u2282 S 1 be an exceptional set where (\u2217) does not hold. It\nfollows that the Lebesgue measure:\nmeas \u03c6(A) = 0\nfor all \u03c6 \u2208 Mapg,1 , considered as a quasisymmetric homeomorphism of S 1 .\nProof.- Complexifying, we find a holomorphic section of an affine bundle\nEC as in section 1. Lifting to H2 , we obtain an equivariant holomorphic\nmap (we replace H by H \u2297 C)\nfe : H2 \u2192 H.\n\nNotice that fe is a Bloch function, that is, k\u2207fek \u2264 const. The result now\nfollows from a version of the Makarov law [Makarov 1] of iterated logarithm\nfor Hilbert-space-valued Bloch functions.\nProposition.- Let \u03c8 : B 2 \u2192 H be holomorphic and k\u2207\u03c8kh \u2264 const.

The Hardy identity [Pommerenke 1, page 174] holds in the following form. Let S be a Riemannian\nsurface, z0 \u2208 S, g : S \u2192 H a holomorphic function, (x, y) normal coordinates\nin the neighbourhood of z0 . Let n be a positive integer. Then\n\u2202\n(g, g)n+1 = (n + 1)(g, g)[(gx\u2032 , g) + (g, gx\u2032 )],\n\u2202x\n81\n\n\f\u22022\n(g, g)n+1\n\u2202x2\n\n= n(n + 1)(g, g)n\u22121[gx\u2032 , g) + (g, gx\u2032 )]2 +\n\n(n + 1)(g, g)n[2(gx\u2032 , gx\u2032 ) + (gx\u2032\u2032 , g) + (g, gx\u2032\u2032 )]\nand the same for\n\n\u22022\n\u2202y 2 .\n\nSumming up, we have\n\n2\n\n\u2202\n\u25b3(g, g)n+1 = ( \u2202x\n2 +\n\n\u22022\n)(g, g)n+1\n\u2202y 2\n\n= n(n + 1)(g, g)n\u22121 * 4|(g \u2032, g)|2 + (n + 1)(g, g)n * 2(g \u2032, g \u2032 ),\n\nbecause \u25b3g = 0 and gy\u2032 =\ncoordinates z = reit\n\u25b3=\n\n\u221a\n\n\u22121gx\u2032 .

The rest of the proof\nwill go unchanged once we know the Hardy-Littlewood maximal theorem\nfor (g, g)n , which is used in [Pommerenke 1, page 187]. Let\ng\u2217 (s, \u03be) =\n\nmax\n\n0\u2264r\u22641\u2212e\u2212s\n\n|g(r\u03be)|, e \u2264 s < \u221e, \u03be \u2208 S 1 .\n\nSince g : B 2 \u2192 H is holomorphic, it is also harmonic and yields the Poisson\nformula. Then a proof of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal theorem given in\n[Koosis 1] applies, since it reduces it to the Hardy-Littlewood inequality for\nthe maximal function of |g|.\nRemark 3.2.- Theorem 3.1 holds for complex hyperbolic cocompact lattices.\nThis is because Makarov's law of iterated logarithm holds for the complex\nhyperbolic space, as we can see by passing to totally geodesic spaces of\ncomplex dimension 1. It is plausible that a version of Theorem 3.1 holds\nfor real hyperbolic lattices (but not quaternionic and Cayley, as these are\n82\n\n\fKazhdan, see a new proof in Chapter VI). On the other hand, another\ndeep result of [Makarov 2] saying that Bloch functions are nontangentially\nbounded for a limit set of Hausdorff dimension one, fails for Hilbert space\nvalued functions. In fact, we have shown in Chapter I that there are unitary\ncocycles on a surface group such that kl(g)k \u2192 \u221e as length(g) \u2192 \u221e.\nIf G is any finitely generated group, and we are given an orthogonal\nrepresentation \u03c0 : G \u2192 O(H) and a cocycle l \u2208 Z 1 (G, H) with a control on\nkl(g)k from below, then for any embedding of the surface group \u03c01 (\u03a3) into\nG we immediately have a comparison inequality between the word lengthes\nof elements of \u03c01 (\u03a3) in \u03c01 (\u03a3) and G. To get a nontrivial result, we need\na low bound on kl(g)k better then [length(g) log log length(g)]1/2 . To find\nsuch groups and cocycles seems to be a very attractive problem.\nWe will now use similar ideas to estimate the Hausdorff dimension of\nlimit sets of some infinite index subgroups of G = \u03c01 (\u03a3).\nTheorem 3.2.- Let \u03b2 : G \u2192 Z be a surjective homomorphism and let\nG0 = Ker\u03b2. Let A be a conical limit set of G0 . Then dim A = 1.\nProof.- Let [\u03b2] \u2208 H 1 (G, Z) be an induced class. Realize G as a cocompact\nlattice in SO+ (1, 2) so that S = H2 /G is a hyperbolic surface. Let \u03c9 be\na holomorphic 1-form on S such that Re[\u03c9] = [\u03b2] and let \u03c9\ne be a lift of \u03c9\non H2 . Let f : H2 \u2192 C be holomorphic with df = \u03c9. Then f is a Bloch\nfunction. By a result of [Makarov 2], there is a set B \u2282 S 1 with dim B = 1\nsuch that\nlim sup |f (z)| < \u221e\nz\u2192\u03b8\n\nfor any \u03b8 \u2208 B and nontangential convergence. Notice that f (gz) = f (z) +\n([\u03c9], [g]) where g \u2208 G and [g] is an image of g in H1 (G, Z). Now it is clear\nthat B \u2286 A, so dim A = 1.\nRemark.- This result does not contradict a theorem of [Sullivan 1] and\n[Tukia 1] because G0 is infinitely generated.\nIn the opposite direction we have the following . Let \u03a31 , \u03a32 be two closed\n83\n\n\fsurfaces and let \u03c8 : \u03a31 \u2192 \u03a32 be a smooth ramified covering. Let Gi = \u03c01 (\u03a3i )\nand let G0 = Ker\u03c8\u2217 : G1 \u2192 G2 . Let G1 \u0592\u2192 SO+ (1, 2) be a realization of\nG1 as a lattice. Then for any z \u2208 B 2 ,\nX\n|1 \u2212 gz| < \u221e.\ng\u2208G0\n\nIn other words, either \u03b4(G0 ) < 1 or \u03b4(G0 ) = 1 and G0 is of convergence type.\nIn the latter case, the Patterson measure of the conical limit set of G0 is zero.\nTo see this, notice that we can find hyperbolic structures on \u03a3i , i = 1, 2 so\nthat \u03c8 is holomorphic. Let \u03c8e be a lift of \u03c8 as a map \u03c8e : B 2 \u2192 B 2 . Since\n\u03c8e is a bounded holomorphic function, \u03c8e has limit values almost everywhere\ne 1 | = 1 almost everywhere. So \u03c8e is an inner function.\non S 1 . By I.6.5., |\u03c8|S\ne We claim that C is a finite\nLet C \u2282 B 2 be a countable set of zeros of \u03c8.\nunion of orbits of G0 . First, it is clear that C is G0 -invariant. Let Q \u2282 B 2\ne\nbe compact which contains a fundamental domain for G1 . Then \u03c8(Q)\nis\ne\ncompact so there is a finite set R \u2282 G2 such that g(0) \u2208\n/ \u03c8(Q)\nif g \u2208\n/ R. Let\nS\nT \u2282 G1 be finite and such that \u03c8\u2217 (T ) \u2287 R. Let Q1 = g\u2208T \u22121 gQ so that\nQ1 is compact and therefore C \u2229 Q is finite. Let x \u2208 C, then x = gy with\ne\ne\ne\ne\ny \u2208 Q. So 0 = \u03c8(x)\n= \u03c8\u2217 (g)\u03c8(y),\ni.e., \u03c8\u2217 (g \u22121 )(0) = \u03c8(y)\n\u2208 \u03c8(Q).\nThis\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\nmeans \u03c8\u2217 (g ) \u2208 R so g \u2208 T G0 , and g \u2208 G0 T , say g = g0 t , g0 \u2208 G0 ,\nt \u2208 T . Then t\u22121 y \u2208 C and t\u22121 y \u2208 Q1 , so there are finitely many options for\nt\u22121 y.\nS\nWe deduce that there are x1 , * * * , xn such that C = ni=1 G0 xi .

The two leading topics studied in Chapter 2, namely, (non-) Kazhdan groups acting on S 1 and characteristic classes, have exact analogues\nfor Sympl(M). In fact, a theory of characteristic classes parallel to II.5 ,\nhas already been presented in [Reznikov 2] and [Reznikov 4]. In the second cited paper, we noticed that the K\u00e4hler action of Sympl(M) on the\n2k (Sympl(M ), R),\ntwistor variety allows us to define a series of classes in Hcont\nk odd , which are highly non-trivial. In the first cited paper,we introduced\nodd (Sympl(M )) and\nbi-invariant forms on Sympl(M) and the classes in Htop\nH odd (Sympl(M )\u03b4 , R/A) (cohomology of a topological space and a discrete\ngroup) where A is a group of periods of the above-mentioned forms. Here we\npresent a fundamental class in H 1 (Sympl(M ), L2 (M )) whose nontriviality\non a subgroup G \u2282 Sympl(M ) implies that G is not Kazhdan, similarly to\nthe situation in Dif f 1,\u03b1(S 1 ). \u00bfFrom the nature of our class it is clear that\nits vanishing imposes severe restriction on the symplectic action, roughly,\nthe transformations of G should satisfy a certain PDE . We give an explicit\nformula for our class in the case of a flat torus.\nWe then introduce a characteristic class in H n+1 (Sympl\u03b4 (M 2n ), R) as85\n\n\fsociated with a compact Lagrangian immersed submanifold. This class is\na sympletic counterpart, and a generalization, of the Thurston-Bott class\n[Bott 1]. We use this class to give a formula for the volume of compact negatively curved manifold through Euclidean volumes of \"Busemann bodies\"\n(the images of the manifold under Busemann functions).\n\n4.1\n\nDeformation quantization : an overview\n\nLet F be a field and A|F a (commutative) algebra . A deformation of A is an\nalgebra structure over F [[~]] of A[[~]] extending that A, so that if x, y \u2208 A,\nx \u2217 y = x * y + b1 (x, y)~ + b2 (x, y)~2 + * * *\nwhere x * y is a multiplication in A and x \u2217 y is a deformed multiplication .\n\nIf F = R, A = C \u221e (M ), where M is a symplectic manifold , then a\ndeformation quantization is a deformation of A with b1 (f, g) = {f, g}, a\nPoisson bracket . A deformation quantization always exists by a result\nof [Moyal 1], [Vey 1], [Bayen-Flato-Fronsdal-Lichnerowicz-Sternheimer 1]\n[Fedosov 1]. For any algebra A|F one defines a Hochschild collomology\nHH k (A) = ExtkA\u2297A (A, A). There is a natural Lie superalgebra structure\nin HH \u2217 (A) [Gerstenhaber 1]. There exists a simple explicit complex , comN\nputing HH k (A) with C k (A) = HomF ( ki=1 A, A). In particular , b1 above\nis a cocycle (for any deformation ).

Let M be any (possibly noncompact)\nsymplectic manifold, and let L0 \u0592\u2192 M be a Lagrangian immersion of a\ncompact oriented manifold L0 . Let Lag(L0 , M ) be a space of Lagrangian\nimmersions of L into M which can be jointed to L0 by an exact Lagrangian\nhomotopy. This means the following. If ft \u2192 M is a smooth family of Lad\ngrangian immersions, than ft |t=0 is a vector field along L0 . Projecting to\ndt\nthe normal bundle N L0 and accounting that N L0 is canonically isomorphic\n90\n\n\fto T \u2217 L0 , we get a 1-form on L0 which is immediately seen to be closed. A\nLagrangian homotopy ft is exact, if this form is exact for all t. There is\ntherefore a well-defined function F (mod const ) on L which can be seen as\na tangent vector of the deformation .\nDefinition.- A canonical (n+1)-form \u03bd on Lag(L, M ) is defined by\nZ\ne\nF0 dF1 * * * Fn = V oln+1 (Q)\n(\u2217),\n\u03bd(F0 * * * Fn ) =\nL\n\ne is any chain in Rn+1 spanning (F0 , * * * , Fn )(L).\nwhere Q\nProposition 4.1-\u03bd is closed.\n\nProof is an exercise for reader.\nLet Sympl0 (M ) be a group of Poissonian transformations of M . Then\nLag(L, M ) is invariant under Sympl0 (M ).\nProposition 4.2.- \u03bd is Sympl0 (M )-invariant.\nProof is obvious.\nA standard theory of regulators [Reznikov 3], [Reznikov 2] implies that,\nfirst, one has an induced class in H n+1 (g, R). where g = Lie(Sympl0 (M ))=\nC \u221e (M )/const given by (\u2217), where now Fi \u2208 C \u221e (M ) and second, a class in\n+\n\nHom(\u03c0n+1 (BSympl0\u03b4 (M ) , R/A))\n\n(n + 1 \u2265 5),\n\nwhere A is a group of periods of \u03bd on maps \u03a3n+1 \u2192 Sympl0 (M ) of homology\nspheres to Sympl0 (M ). This class often lifts to a class in H n+1 (Sympl0\u03b4 (M ), R)\nunder suitable conditions on topology of Sympl0 (M ) (see the discussion in\nthe papers cited above ).\nAs an example, let Q be a compact oriented simply connected manifold, M = T \u2217 Q and L0 = Q, a zero section. Then we obtain a class\n91\n\n\f[\u03bd] in H n+1 (Sympl0 (T \u2217 Q), R). Notice that the restriction of this class on\nDif f (Q) \u0592\u2192 Sympl0 (T \u2217 Q) is zero, as Dif f (Q) fixes the zero section. However , our class is an extension of Thurston-Bott class [Bott 1] in Dif f (Q) by\nmeans of the following construction. Let G \u2282 Sympl0 (T \u2217 Q) be a subgroup\nof symplectomorphisms of the form\npx 7\u2192 \u03c6\u2217 px + df (x),\nwhere f \u2208 C \u221e (Q), \u03c6 \u2208 Dif f (Q), x \u2208 Q, px \u2208 Tx\u2217 Q.

For\nn = 2 this is always the case [Hurder-Katok 1], whereas for n \u2265 3 seems to\nrequire a pinching of the curvature. Notice that the map\ns+ : CN \u2192 S\u221e ,\nsending any geodesic \u03b3(t) to \u03b3(\u221e), is a Lagrangian fibration. Therefore\nif we fix a Lagrangian section of s+ , we will have a symplectomorphism\n93\n\n\fCN \u2243 T \u2217 (S\u221e ). Fix p0 \u2208 N , then Sp0 is such a section. Notice that an\ninduced homomorphism G \u2192 Sympl(T \u2217 S\u221e ) is given by ,\ng 7\u2192 (z 7\u2192 \u03c0(g)z + dF (p0 , g\u22121 p0 , \u03b8)),\nn\u22121\n\nwhere g \u2208 G, z \u2208 T\u03b8\u2217 S\u221e , \u03c0 : G \u2192 Dif f 1, n (S\u221e ) \u2192 Sympl(T \u2217 S\u221e ) is\ninduced by the action of G on S\u221e and B(p0 , g\u22121 p0 , \u03b8)) is the Buseman funcn\u22121\nn\u22121\ntion.

The main\nidea is to use twistor varietes, which were in a center of the characteristic\nclasses construction of [Reznikov 4], for a deeper study of volume-preserving\nactions of groups. We introduce an invariant of a volume-preserving action,\nwhich we call \u039b, which is a sort of a log L2 -version of a sup-displacement\nstudied in [Zimmer 2]. Our first main result, Theorem 2.3, states that if\nG is a Kazhdan group acting on a compact manifold M preserving volume,\nthen either \u039b > 0 or G fixes a log L2 -metric. A much weaker analogue of\nthis result for the special case of lattices in Lie groups and sup-displacement\nwas known before [Zimmer 2, Theorem 4.8].\n95\n\n\fWe then apply our technique to a major open problem in the field, that\nof the nonlinear superrigidity of volume-preserving actions of lattices in Lie\ngroups. From a nonlinear version of Margulis theorem given in [Zimmer 3]\none knows that a volume preserving action of a lattice in a semisimple Lie\ngroup of rank \u2265 2 on a low dimensional (with respect to the group) manifold\nfixes a measurable Riemannian metric. Since measurable metrics do not\ndefine a geometry on a manifold, one wishes ,of course, to prove a much\nstronger result: that the action preserves a smooth metric. Zimmer noticed\n[Zimmer 2 and references therein] that such strong result would follow if\none is able to find an invariant metric whose dilations with respect to any\nsmooth metric are in the class L2loc . The central question of how to find\nsuch a \"bounded\" invariant metric was left completely open. We present a\ncompletely new approach to the problem which leads to Theorem 3.1. It\nstates that if a cocompact lattice acts on M preserving volume, then either\nit nearly preserves a log L2 -metric, or a sort of G-structure. This theorem,\nthough constituting a clear progress in solution of the main problem is still\nless than what one wants in two respects: first, we deal with log L2 -metrics,\nnot L2 -metrics, second, we leave open a very delicate situation when an\naction nearly preserves a log L2 -metric, but does not exactly preserve such\na metric. This situation is purely infinite-dimensional (if an action on a\nfinitely dimensional space of nonpositive curvature nearly preserves a point,\nit actually preserves a point at infinity). As already said, we use a heavy\nmachinery : harmonic maps into twistor varietes and vanishing results of\n[Mok-Siu-Yeung 1] and [Corlette 1]. These results will also be applied in the\nnext Chapter to study quaternionic K\u00e4hler groups.\nAs is well-known, an original Kolmogorov's definition of entropy used\nextremum over all partitions and only became computable after it had been\nrealized by Kolmogorov and Sinai that certain partitions realize entropy.\nIn a way of a pleasant similarity, we show how to compute our invariant\n\u039b for G = Z in case G leaves a geodesic in the twistor space invariant,\nlike a hyperbolic element of SL(n, Z) acting on T n . This clearly shows an\nadvantage of log L2 -displacement over sup-displacement.\n\n96\n\n\f5.1\n\nlog L2 -twistor spaces\n\nTwistor varietes (C \u221e ) were used in [Reznikov 4] to define secondary characteristic classes for volume-preserving and symplectic actions. More specifically, we have defined, for a compact oriented manifold M equipped with a\n\u2217 (Dif f (M )) of dimension 5, 9, 13, * * *\nvolume form \u03bd, a series of classes in Hcont\n\u03bd\n(where Dif f \u03bd (M )) is a group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms). Likewise, for a compact symplectic manifold M we have defined classes in\n\u2217 (Sympl(M )) of dimensions of 2, 6, 10, * * * . For purposes of the present\nHcont\npaper, we will need to work with a log L2 -version of twistor varietes, defined\nbelow.\nRemark 1.1.- I would like to use an opportunity to note that by some\nn (Dif f (M n )).\nstrange reason I have overlooked an integrated Euler class in Hcont\n\u03bd\nThe definition is exactly like that in [Reznikov 4] for classes in dimensions\n5, 9, * * * if one realizes that there exists an n-form on the twistor variety for\nM , which is Dif f \u03bd -invariant. Alternatively, if Dif f \u03bd (M, p0 ) is a subgroup\nfixing a point p0 , then one pulls back the Euler class of SLn (R) under the\ntangent representation\nDif f \u03bd (M, p0 ) \u2192 SLn (R),\nand then applies a measurable transfer (see the above cited paper). The just\ndefined class viewed as a class in H n (Dif f s\u03bd (M )) is bounded. This follows\nfrom the fact that the Euler class is bounded [Sullivan 2] exactly in the same\nmanner as in [Reznikov 4].\nWe now define the log L2 -twistor variety X for (M, \u03bd). First, one defines\na bundle P of metrics with volume form \u03bd as an SL(n)/SO(n)-bundle,\nassociated with a principal SL(n)-bundle, defined by \u03bd. Fix a smooth section\n(=a Riemannian metric with volume form \u03bd) g0 of this bundle. For any other\nmeasurable section g of P define\nZ\n2\n\u03c12x (g0 , g)d\u03bd,\n(\u2217)\n\u03c1 (g0 , g) =\nM\n\n97\n\n\fwhere \u03c1x is a distance in Px induced by (fixed once forever) SL(n)-invariant\nmetric on SL(n)/SO(n). Now the twistor variety X consists of log L2 metrics, that is,\n\u03c1(g0 , g) < \u221e.\nAlternatively, let Ax be a self-adjoint (with respect to (g0 )x ) operator such\nthat gx = g0 (Ax *, *). Then (\u2217) can be written as\nZ\nk log Ax k2 d\u03bd < \u221e.\nM\n\nA crucial fact about P is a following\nProposition 1.2.- P is a complete Hilbert Riemannian manifold with nonpositive curvature operator. The action of Dif f \u03bd (M ) on P is isometric.\nProof.- We will only define a metric, leaving all routine checks to the reader.\nA tangent space at g0 consists of L2 -sections of S 2 T \u2217 M , with trace identically zero. If A is such a section (so that Ax is g0 -self-adjoint for all x \u2208 M,)\nthen we define a square of the length of A as\nZ\ntrA2 d\u03bd.\nM\n\nThis metric is invariant under SO(n)-valued gauge transformations. Now\nwe define a log L2 SL(n)-gauge group as a group of measurable sections of\nAut(T M ) such that with respect to g0 ,\nZ\nk log(A\u2217 A)k2 d\u03bd < \u221e.\nM\n\nThen P is a homogeneous space under the action of this group. We define a\nmetric on P as a unique invariant metric, which agrees at g0 with the metric\njust defined.\nNow let (M 2n , \u03c9) be a compact symplectic manifold. Let T be the\ntwistor bundle, that is, an Sp(2n)/U (n)-bundle, associated with the principal Sp(2n)-bundle, defined by \u03c9. A smooth section of T is exactly a tamed\nalmost-complex structure. One then defines a space Z of log L2 -sections of\nT as above (the C \u221e -version was used in [Reznikov 4]).\n98\n\n\fProsition 1.3.- The spaces X and Z are Alexandrov and Busemann nonpositively curved.\nProofs are standard.\n\n5.2\n\nA new invariant of smooth volume-preserving\ndinamical systems\n\nLet (M, \u03bd) be a compact oriented manifold with volume form \u03bd. Let G\nbe a finitely generated group which acts on M by smooth transformations,\npreserving \u03bd. We are going to define a new dinamical invariant which we\ncall \u039b. This is a nonnegative real number. Though it depends on the\nchoice of a system of generators of G, the crucial fact of whether \u039b > 0 or\n\u039b = 0 does not. This relates our \u039b to Kolmogorov's entropy [Kolmogorov\n1]. The invariant \u039b is highly nontrivial already for G = Z, that is, as a\nnew invariant of a volume-preserving diffeomorphism. It is also an invariant\nunder conjugation in Dif f \u03bd (M ). A central result of this section is Theorem\n2 below stating that if G is a Kazhdan group then either \u039b > 0 or G fixes\na log L2 -Riemannian metric (again this connects \u039b to the Kolmogorov's\nentropy).\nLet g1 , * * * , gn be a system of generators for G. Let X be the twistor\nvariety for (M, \u03bd). Let \u03c1 be the distance function for X, introduced in\nSection 1. We define \u039b as the displacement of G-action:\n\u039b = inf max \u03c1(gi z, z).\nz\u2208X\n\ni\n\nProposition 2.1.- \u039b is invariant under conjugation in Dif f \u03bd (M ).\nProof.- \u03c1 is Dif f \u03bd -invariant.\nProposition 2.2.- Let M = (T n , can) and let G = Z act by iterations of a\nhyperbolic element of SL(n, Z). Then \u039b > 0.\n99\n\n\fProof.- The proof is based on an observation about Alexandrov non-positively\ncurved spaces and a trick from [Reznikov 4].\nLemma.- Let X be an Alexandrov non-positively curved space and let\n\u03c6 : X \u2192 X be an isometry which leaves invariant a geodesic \u03b3 of X. Then\nthe displacement of \u03c6 is realized on the points of \u03b3, that is, for y \u2208 \u03b3,\n\u03c1(y, \u03c6y) = min \u03c1(x, \u03c6x).\nx\u2208X\n\nProof.- For x \u2208 X let y \u2208 \u03b3 be a point which realizes the distance from x\nto \u03b3. Then \u03c1(y, \u03c6y) \u2264 \u03c1(x, \u03c6x).\nNow let X be the twistor space of T n and let Y \u2282 X be the space of\nmetrics, invariant under shifts (we view T n as a Lie group). Then Y is\ntotally geodesic in X, because it is a manifold of fixed points of a family of\nisometries. As a Riemannian manifold, Y \u2243 SL(n)/SO(n). Any hyperbolic\nmatrix \u03c6 by definition leaves invariant a geodesic in Y . The result follows.\nA main result in the theory of invariant \u039b is as follows.\nTheorem 2.3.- Let G be a Kazhdan group acting on a compact oriented\nmanifold (M, \u03bd) preserving a volume form \u03bd. Then either \u039b > 0 or G fixes\na log L2 -metric on M .\nProof.- Consider an isometric action on X. If the displacement function\nsup \u03c1(gi z, z) is not bounded away from zero, then either there is a fixed point\ni\n\nz0 \u2208 X for G, or G is not Kazhdan, by a result of [Kovevaar-Schoen 1]. The\nresult follows.\n\n5.3\n\nNon-linear superrigidity alternative\n\nTheorem 3.1.-Let G be either a semisimple Lie group of rank\u2265 2, or\nSp(n, 1) or Iso(CaH2 ). Let \u0393 \u2282 G be a cocompact lattice. Let (M n , \u03bd)\n100\n\n\fbe a compact oriented manifold, on which \u0393 acts preserving the volume\nform \u03bd. Then either\na) \u0393 preserves a log L2 - metric on M , or\nb) there exists a sequence g0 , g1 , * * * of smooth Riemannian metrics on M\nwith volume form \u03bd such that\nZ\nk log Ai k2g0 d\u03bd \u2192 \u221e,\nM\n\nwhere gi = g0 (Ai *, *) and\n0 < const1 < sup\nj\n\nZ\n\nM\n\nk log Bij k2gi d\u03bd < const2 ,\n\n(i \u2192 \u221e),\n\nwhere \u03b3j\u2217 gi = gi (Bij *, *), {\u03b3j } is a fixed finite set of generators for \u0393, or\nc) there is a nonconstant totally geodesic \u0393-invariant map\n\u03a8 : G/K \u2192 X,\nwhere K is a maximal compact subgroup of G.\nRemarks.1)\n\nIn case b) we say that \u0393 nearly fixes a log L2 -metric on M .\n\n2) the case c) implies, for G simple, that dim G/K \u2264 dim SL(n)/SO(n),\na so-called Zimmer conjecture.\n3) for G = SL(m, R), m \u2265 3 and n = m, one deduces in case c) an\nexistence of a measurable frame field \u00ea(x), \u00ea = (e1 , * * * , en ), such that for\nalmost all x \u2208 M ,\n\u03c0(\u03b3)\u2217 [\u00ea(x)] = \u03b3\u00ea(\u03c0(\u03b3)x)\nwhere \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 and \u03c0(\u03b3) is an action of \u03b3 on M .\n4) Conversely, a standard action of SL(n, Z) on T n does not satisfy a)\n(which is well-known) and b). To see this, we notice that SL(n, Z) leaves\ninvariant a totally geodesic space Y introduced in the proof of Proposition\n2.2. The argument of this proof implies that it is enough to show that the\n101\n\n\fdisplacement function of the action of \u0393 on Y diverges to \u221e as one escapes\nall compact sets of Y . This follows from the fact that Y is a Riemannian\nsymmetric space of non-compact type and \u0393 does not fix a point at infinity\nof Y .\n5) The statement of Theorem constitutes a definite progress in the nonlinear superrigidity problem. There is still a mystery in the option b) where\none would prefer a statement that \u0393 fixes a \"point at infinity\" of the space of\nmetrics X, perhaps a measurable distribution of k-dimension planes, k \u2264 n.\nAt the time of writing this chapter (August, 1999) I am unable to make such\na reduction.\nProof. follows a long-established tradition [Siu 1], [Corlette 1], [Mok-SiuYeung 1], see also a treatment of [Jost-Yau 1], in a new infinite-dimensional\ntarget context. If neither a) or b) holds then, accounting that \u0393 is Kazhdan,\nwe deduce that the displacement function of \u0393 tends to infinity as one escapes all bounded sets in X. Let F \u2192 \u0393 \\ G/K be a flat fibration with fiber\nX, corresponding to the action of \u0393 in X. A theorem of [Kovevaar-Schoen\n1], or [Jost 1] implies that there is a harmonic section of F . By Propositon\n1.2 and main theorem of [Corlette 1] and [Mok-Siu-Yeung 1], this section\nmust be totally geodesic. The result follows.\nIn the case of symplectic action of lattice \u0393 on a compact symplectic\nmanifold (M, \u03c9) we have a comletely similar theorem, as follows.\nTheorem 3.2.- Let G be either a semi-simple Lie group of rank\u2265 2, or\nSp(n, 1) or Iso(CaH2 ), \u0393 a cocompact lattice in G which acts symplectically\non a compact symplectic manifold (M 2n , \u03c9). Then either\na)\n\n\u0393 fixes a log L2 tamed almost-complex structure J, or\n\nb) there exists a sequence of tamed smooth almost-complex structures\nJi \u2208 Z with \u03c1(J0 , Ji ) \u2192 \u221e and\n0 < const2 < sup \u03c1(\u03b3j Ji , Ji ) < const1 ,\nj\n\n102\n\nor\n\n\fc)\n\nthere is a \u0393-invariant totally geodesic map\n\u03a8 : G/K \u2192 Z.\n\nProof. is exactly as above.\nIn case c) and G simple it follows that dim G/K \u2264 dim Sp(2n)/U (n). If\nM = (T 2n , can), G = Sp(2n, R) and case c) one deduces an existence of a\nmeasurable symplectic frame \u00ea(x) = (e1 , * * * , e2n (x)), such that for \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393,\n\u03c0(\u03b3)\u2217 [\u00ea(x)] = \u03b3\u00ea(\u03c0(\u03b3)(x)).\n\n103\n\n\f104\n\n\fChapter 6\n\nK\u00e4hler and quaternionic\nK\u00e4hler groups\nIn a letter to the author [Deligne 1] P.Deligne asked if one can extend the\nauthor's theorem on rationality of secondary characteristic classes of a flat\nbundle over a projective variety to quasiprojective varieties. In 1994 the\nauthor was able to answer this question positively for the special case of\nnoncompact ball quotients using an analytic technique of [Gromov-Schoen\n1] and the scheme of the original proof for projective varietes. Here we\npresent a full answer to Deligne's question, Theorem 1.1, using an analytic\ntechnique of [Jost-Zuo 1], who produced harmonic maps of infinite energy\nbut controlled growth.\nWe then turn to a well-known open problem of finding restriction on\ntopology of compact quaternionic K\u00e4hler manifolds. In case of positive\nscalar curvature the situation is well-understood, but in case of negative\nscalar curvature the twistor spaces of [Solomon 1] are not K\u00e4hler and its\ntechnique fails. The only result known was a theorem of [Corlette 1] stating\nthat the fundamental group does not have infinite linear representations unless the manifold is locally symmetric. Our result, Theorem 2.2, states that\nthe fundamental group is Kazhdan. This is of course, a severe restriction\n(Kazhdan groups are rare). As a by-product of our technique, we obtain\na new proof of a classical theorem, stating that the lattices in semisimple\n105\n\n\fLie groups of rank \u2265 2, Sp(n, 1) and Iso(CaH2 ) are Kazhdan. We also\nshow using I.1 that the classes in second cohomology space of a K\u00e4hler nonKazhdan group, constructed in [Reznikov 6] and shown there nontrivial, are\nof polynomial growth. This again is very rare for \"just a group\", as polynomial growth in cohomology is connected to a polynomial isoperimetric\ninequality in the Cayley graph, which needs a special reason to hold. This\nmeans K\u00e4hler groups are rare, too.\n\n6.1\n\nRationality of secondary classes of flat bundler\nover quasiprojective varietes\n\nA rationality theorem for secondary classes of flat bundles over compact\nK\u00e4hler manifolds (previously known as Bloch conjecture [Bloch 1]) has been\nproved in 1993 in [Reznikov 3] and [Reznikov 5]. In a letter to the author\n[Deligne 1] P.Deligne asked if one can prove such a statement for local system\nwith logarithmic singularities over a quasiprojective variety. The answer\nhappens to be yes.\nTheorem 1.1.- Let X be a quasiprojective variety, \u03c1 : \u03c01 (X) \u2192 SL(n, C)\na representation. Let bi (\u03c1) be the imaginary part and ChSi (\u03c1) the R/Zpart of the secondary class ci (\u03c1) \u2208 H 2i\u22121 (X, C/Z) of the flat bundle with\nmonodromy \u03c1. Then\nA. bi (\u03c1) = 0 (i \u2265 2) (the Vanishing Theorem).\nB. ChSi (\u03c1) \u2208 H 2i\u22121 (X, Q/Z) (the Rationality Theorem).\nProof.- For any smooth manifold, A implies B, as explained in the above\ncited papers. So we only prove A. Again it is explained in the above\ncited papers that we may assume \u03c1 to be irreducible. Then by a recent\nresult [Jost-Zuo 1] an associated SL(n, C)/SU (n) flat bundle over X possesses a pluriharmonic section s which satisfies the Sampson degeneration\ncondition. This means the following. The derivative Dsx , x \u2208 X can\nbe viewed as a R-linear map to the space P of Hermitian matrices. Let\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(Dsx )\u00b1\n\u22121Dsx ( \u22121Y )) be a map of T X to P \u2297 C.\nC (Y ) = (Dsx (Y ) \u00b1\n106\n\n\fThen the image of (Dsx )\u00b1\nC consists of commuting matrices. Now a first\nproof of the Main Theorem in [Reznikov 5] applies word-to-word and the\nresult follows.\n\n6.2\n\nKazhdan property T for K\u00e4hler and quaternionic K\u00e4hler groups\n\nThere are two ways to geometrize group theory. One approach (a time geometry in the terminology of [Reznikov 7]) is to consider finitely generated\ngroups which act on a (usually compact) space with some structure (a volume form, a symplectic form, a tree, a circle, a conformal structure, etc).\nAn amazing phenomenon, amply demonstrated in the previous chapters is\nthat these groups tend to be not Kazhdan. Another approach (a space geometry) is to consider groups which are fundamental groups of a compact\n(or closed to compact) manifold with some structure (like K\u00e4hler). It happens that these groups tend to be Kazhdan. Therefore these two families\nof \"geometric\" groups are essentically disjoint. A following result is a main\ntheorem of [Reznikov 6].\nTheorem.- Let G be a fundamental group of a compact K\u00e4hler manifold.\nIf G is not Kazhdan, then H 2 (G, R) 6= 0. Moreover, if H is not Kazhdan\nand \u03c8 : G \u2192 H is surjective then 0 6= \u03c8 \u2217 : H 2 (H, R) \u2192 H 2 (G, R).\nI would like to notice an important property, which I overlooked in\n[Reznikov 6].\nProposition 2.1.-Under the conditions of the Theorem, there is a nontrivial\nclass of polynomial growth in H 2 (G, R).\nProof.- There is a unitary representation \u03c1 : G \u2192 U (H) and a class\nl \u2208 H 1 (G, H) such that a class \u03b3 in H 2 (G, R) given by hl, li is nonzero,\nwhere h*, *i is an imaginary part of the scalar product in H. This is proved\n107\n\n\fin [Reznikov 6]. Now the result follows from Lemma I 1.1.\nIt is extremely rare for a finitely generated group to have nonzero polynomial cohomology.\nWe now turn to quaternionic K\u00e4hler manifolds. If a scalar curvature is\npositive, then the topology is very well understood [Solomon 1]. On the\ncontrary, if the scalar curvature is negative, the only result known is that\nthe fundamental group satisfy the geometric superrigidity [Corlette 1]. This\nmeans if \u03c01 (X) admits a Zariski-dense representation in an algebraic Lie\ngroup, then \u03c01 (X) is a lattice, and X a symmetric space of a known type.\nHowever, it is a rare occasion for a group to have any finite dimensional\nlinear representation with infinite image. Using a combination of ideas of\n[Corlette 1] and [Reznikov 6] which is based on [Korevaar-Schoen 1] we now\nprove a very stong structure theorem.\nTheorem 2.2.-Let X be a quaternionic K\u00e4hler manifold of negative scalar\ncurvature. Then \u03c01 (X) is Kazhdan.\nProof.-Suppose not. Then by [Korevaar-Schoen 1] there exists an affine\nflat Hilbert bundle E over X with a nonparallel harmonic section. By a\nvanishing result of [Corlette 1] this section must be totally geodesic. Then\nX must be covered by a flat torus, a contradiction.\nRemark.- The same argument provides a new proof of the classical theorem [Kazhdan 1], [Kostant 1] , that the (cocompact) lattices in semisimple\nLie groups of rank\u2265 2, Sp(n, 1) and Iso(CaH2 ) are Kazhdan. One uses a\nvanishing result of [Mok-Siu-Yeung 1] ( see also a treatment in [Jost-Yau 1])\nfor lattices in semisimple Lie groups of rank\u2265 2, and the above-mentioned\nresult of [Corlette 1] for Sp(n, 1) and Iso(CaH2 ). Once established for cocompact lattices, the result follows for all lattices because a Lie group and\na lattice in it are or are not Kazhdan at the same time.\n\n108\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[Adams-Ratiu-Schmid 1] M.Adams, T.Ratiu, R.Schmid.-The Lie grouip structure\nof diffeomorphism groups and Fourier integral operators with applications, in: Infinite dimensional Lie groups with applications, V.Kac, Editor, Springer, 1985.\n[Alperin 1] R.Alperin.-Locally compact groups acting on trees and property T ,\nMh.Math, 93 (1982), 261-265.\n[Beurling-Ahlfors 1] A.Beurling, L.Ahlfors.-The boundary correspondence under\nquasiconformal mappings, Acta Math., 96 (1956), 125\u2013142.\n[Arakelov 1]\n[Bayen-Flato-Fronsdal-Lichnerowicz-Sternheimer ] F.Bayen, M.Flato, C.Fronsdal,\nA.Lichnerowicz, D.Sternheimer.- Deformation theory and quantization, Ann.
