discuss how, in the theoretical scenario presented in [1], the gravity screening and the\ngravity impulse which seem to be produced under certain conditions by high temperature\nsuperconductors are expected to be an entropic response to the flow of part of the system\ninto a deeper quantum regime.\n\n\u2020\n\ne-mail: agregori@libero.it\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nAlthough not a new branch of research, the physics of superconductors appears the more\nand more to provide us with a source of experimental and theoretical challenges, calling for a\nbetter understanding of quantum phenomena. In particular, this is true for high temperature\nsuperconductors. In a recent work, we proposed the existence of a relation between the critical temperature of superconduction and the energy distribution of the geometric structure,\ni.e. the geometry of the superconductor intended in the sense of General Relativity [2]. The\ntheoretical ground of this idea is that, at a more fundamental level than the one of quantum\nelectrodynamics, quantization of the geometry of space cannot be neglected. Its effects, that\ncan be generally referred to as \"quantum gravity\", do not simply involve quantization of\nthe propagating gravitational field (i.e. roughly speaking treating the graviton in a similar\nway to the photon), but imply quantization of the geometry of space itself. As a result,\none obtains an effective dependence of the quantum delocalization, or, if one prefers, of the\nPlanck constant as it enters in the Uncertainty Principle, on the geometry of space. Taking\nthis into account, we were able to compute several critical temperatures of high temperature\nsuperconductors, as a pure theoretical prediction from the analysis of their lattice structure.\nIn this note, we want to consider some other important aspects of the physics of high temperature superconductors, which are the object of (controversial) experimental investigation,\nnamely the detection of some kind of gravity screening produced by rotating superconductors, or gravity-like impulse produced by a superconductor undergoing an electric discharge\n[3], [4], [5]. Attempts to explain these effects in the light of a quantum gravity theoretical\nframework have been proposed in [6], [7], [8]. Here we want to discuss how all these effects\nare a natural prediction of the theoretical scenario described in [9], updated in [1], namely\nthe same theoretical framework in which critical temperatures have been investigated in [2].\nThis discussion will allow us to point out also some important aspects of the quantum gravity\nscenario implied in this framework, in particular about how all forces, and the equivalence\nprinciple at the ground of General Relativity itself, arise from an entropic principle.\n2\n\nA short summary of the theoretical set up\n\nIn Refs. [1] we have introduced a physical scenario describing a universe ruled by a dynamics\nwhich embeds quantum mechanics and general relativity, to which it reduces under appropriate conditions. The basic idea is that the universe is not a particular configuration of\nwhatever kind, among those predicted within the phase space of a certain theory, but the\nwhole of all possible codes of information, time-ordered according to the inclusion of sets,\nthat we interpret as configurations of energy distributed along the space. In some sense,\nthis can be viewed as the generalization of the idea of the Feynman path integral, according\nto which the time evolution of a quantum system is given by the weighted sum over all\ntrajectories 1 . Let us here briefly summarize the main lines of the set up. Consider the set\n\u03a6 = {\u03c8(N )}, N \u2208 N , of all the distributions of an amount N of energy units along a target\nvector space, of any possible dimension, for any N . The subsets \u03a6(N ) \u2261 {\u03c8(N )} have a\nnatural ordering through N , because \u2200\u03c8(N ) \u2208 \u03a6(N ) \u2203\u03c8(M ) \u2208 \u03a6(M ), M > N , such that\n1\n\nFor a discussion of the relation to the Feynman path integral, see [1], section 6.4.\n\n1\n\n\f\u03c8(N ) \u2282 \u03c8(M ). N can therefore be identified with the \"time\". The partition function of the\nuniverse at time T = N is:\nX\nZN =\neS(\u03c8) ,\n(2.1)\n\u03c8(N )\n\nwhere W (\u03c8) \u2261 exp S(\u03c8) is the weight of a configuration \u03c8 in the phase space, S being as\nusual the entropy. N not only works as \"time\", but is also the total energy of the universe\nat time N , implying the identification E = T . The distributions of energy units in a discrete vector space of cells can be viewed as assignments of \"geometry\" given by occupation\ncodes (binary codes, of the type full/empty), and therefore seen as corresponding to codes\nof information. Through this correspondence, one can see that different geometries correspond to different discrete groups of symmetry. The classification of these spaces amounts\ntherefore to a classification of all possible discrete (and in general not simple) groups. This\ncorrespondence allows to make the key observation that different codes of information, i.e.\ndifferent distributions of energy, correspond to different groups of symmetry, and therefore\nhave a different weight in the phase space of all the configurations, the latter being related\nto the volume of the corresponding group. Expression 2.1 says that the universe looks the\nmost like the geometry which is realized in the highest number of equivalent ways, i.e. the\none which has the highest weight, or the highest entropy.\nAt any energy, and time, E \u223c T , the dominant configuration implied by 2.1 is a threesphere of radius R \u223c T , i.e. a universe predominantly consisting of a space with three\ndimensions, and the curvature of a three-sphere \u223c 1/T 2 . Its weight W in the phase space\n\u03a6 is proportional to exp N 2 . The entropy is therefore S \u223c N 2 \u223c T 2 \u223c R2 . The dominant\nconfiguration can be viewed as the one describing the \"classical\" part of the geometry of the\nuniverse. The contribution to any mean value as due to the configurations different from the\ndominant one amounts to a \"smearing\" of the classical value of the order of the Heisenberg\nUncertainty. Quantum mechanics arises in this framework as a way of implementing this\nundefinedness, and the uncertainty principle expresses the fact that any observable in the\nthree-dimensional world is indeed just the average configuration of something which receives\ncontribution from any configuration, in any dimension. The physical world is only in the average three-dimensional, and beyond a certain degree of accuracy the physical quantities and\nany degree of freedom as is characterized in three dimensions cannot not only be measured,\nbut not even be defined. The probabilistic interpretation introduced in quantum mechanics\nis a way to deal with the undefinability of any measurable quantity beyond a certain accuracy, by embedding it in a consistent mathematical-theoretical framework. This enables\nmaking computations, and predictions up to a certain degree of accuracy, while keeping\nunder control the \"unknown\".\n3\n\nForces from entropy\n\nIn this framework, the universe is a staple of configurations, and what we call dynamics,\nand usually describe in terms of forces and interactions, is a parametrization of the changes\nwhich occur in the geometry produced by this staple of configurations. Our distinction\nof interactions and forces into classical and quantum mechanical ones regards the level at\n2\n\n\fwhich we want to consider the physical world, i.e. the degree of approximation we introduce\nwhen giving our description of physical phenomena, and which depends on what kind of\nconfigurations we decide to neglect. Roughly speaking, classical physics basically corresponds\nto considering just the most entropic configurations. Since configurations remote in the phase\nspace have weights which are exponentially suppressed as compared to the most entropic\nones, with an abuse of language we often indicate classical values as \"mean\" values. The most\nentropic of all the configurations describes a sphere in three dimensions., i.e. a completely\nhomogeneous distribution of energy. Were this the only configuration of the universe, the\nonly force existing would be a gravitational force acting in a way to distribute homogeneously\nenergy along this space. However, the contribution of less entropic, and correspondingly less\nhomogeneous, configurations is responsible for the formation of \"clusters\". It is thanks to\nthis that we can perceive gravity as a force which is locally attractive, i.e. which acts in\na way to break the complete homogeneousness of the energy distribution. Including the\nmore and more configurations in our approximation of the universe, up to virtually all\nthe configurations, leads to a quantum mechanical description of physics. This includes\nalso other types of interactions besides gravity, introduced in order to parametrize a more\nintricate structure in which certain types of energy clusters, that we call particles, do not\nsimply attract each other, but interact in a more complicated way.\nIn this context, what we call gravitational attraction is a way of theoretically parametrize\nin terms of forces the fact that two objects tend to go closer to each other, because in\nthis way the entropy of the space around each one, corresponding to the entropy of its\nenergy distribution, gets increased by an amount corresponding to the entropy of the energy\ndistribution of the other object. Of course, in the sum over all configurations 2.1, also\nother motions are included. Indeed, all possible motions are counted. However, they give\nan exponentially suppressed contribution to whatever mean value of observable quantity, so\nthat it makes sense, at least approximately, to speak of \"motion tending to increase entropy\"\nin classical terms. Indeed, in this theoretical framework all forces, not just the gravitational\none, are entropic.\n4\n\nEffective ~ and quantum delocalization\n\nIn the traditional approach to quantum mechanics, the Planck constant sets by convention\nthe size of the quantum uncertainty, namely, the \"normalization\" of the Heisenberg uncertainty relations. On the other hand, in this way it naturally sets also a unit of conversion\nfrom momentum to space, or from energy to time. In our framework, the unit of energy/time\nconversion is a quantity independent on the scale of quantum delocalization. In our case,\nthe \"canonical\" expression of the uncertainty relation:\n\u2206E\u2206t \u2265\n\n~\n,\n2\n\n(4.1)\n\nencodes the fuzziness in mean values as given by the contribution of all the configurations out\nof the most entropic one, which corresponds to a universe with the ground, classical curvature\n\u223c 1/T 2 . In this framework, empty space does not exist: the minimal curvature is the average\ncurvature of the three-sphere geometry of the universe at age T , 1/T 2 is what corresponds\n3\n\n\fto the curvature of the \"empty space\". One can view this as the condition which corresponds\nto considering only the cosmological term of the Einstein's equations, neglecting all other\ncontributions, that come from the local distribution of masses and energies of particles and\nfields. 4.1 is therefore also the uncertainty relation ideally ruling the behavior of what in\nusual terms is the \"free\" electron, or the free electromagnetic field, indeed conditions in\nsome cases well approximated, but rigorously never realized in practice. When the physical\nsystem presents a more complicated geometry, this approximation is no more valid, and the\nrelation 4.1 must be corrected. The reason is that the configuration describing the system is\nin this case a superposition of configurations with an average entropy lower than the highest\none, the one of the \"vacuum\" of the universe, the three-sphere; the relative weight of less\nentropic configurations compared to the one of the system is therefore higher (see sections 2.7\nand 3 of [1]). As a consequence, geometrically remote systems are more quantum-delocalized.\nA typical case of physical system in which the higher amount of quantum delocalization shows\nout in a clearly detectable way is the one of superconductors.\nAs discussed in Ref. [1], in the approximation of neglecting configurations extremely\ndelocalized, and therefore also very remote in the phase space, one can factor out from the\nexpression of the weights in the phase space overall space volume factors, which can be\nconsidered to be the same for all the configurations, and consider the contribution to the\nweight due just to the internal symmetry of a configuration. Under this approximation, the\nentropy of the configuration corresponding to the three-sphere scales as S0 \u223c T 2 . Factoring\nout common volume factors, and approximating sums with integrals, one can therefore write\nan effective partition function of the universe in the form:\nZ 0\nZeff \u223c\ndS eS .\n(4.2)\nS=S0\n\nIsolating the dominant term in the integrand, exp S0 , one obtains a correction of the order\n\u223c (1/S0 ) exp S0 . Remembering that S0 \u223c T 2 , and identifying T with the duration \u2206t of\nthe experiment of measurement, in this case corresponding to the existence of the universe\nitself, one obtains that, during the interval \u2206t, the correction to the energy of the universe\nE \u223c \u2206t, is of the order of:\n\u2206E \u223c E \u2206Zeff \u2248\n\n1\n\u2206t\n=\n.\n2\n(\u2206t)\n\u2206t\n\n(4.3)\n\nThis equality is the lower bound of the ordinary form of the Heisenberg Uncertainty. Indeed,\nthe quantum uncertainty comes from an effective linearization operated on the phase space\nwhen isolating a configuration with highest entropy: the uncertainty is treated as a perturbation of this configuration. This leads to a dependence of the amount of delocalization on\nthe entropy, rather than on the weight itself of the configuration in the phase space.\nLet us now consider cases different from the measurement of the energy of the universe\nitself: let us consider local experiments. A local experiment corresponds to a subset of\nthe universe. In this case, the classical shape around which to expand in order to find the\nquantum corrections is a superposition of geometries, and one should better speak in terms\nof \"mean\" entropy and average geometry S (see [2] for a detailed discussion). In any case,\n4\n\n\fin general S < S0 \u223c (\u2206t)2 , and expression 4.3 becomes:\n\u2206E \u223c\n\n\u2206t\n1\n>\n.\n\u2206t\nS\n\n(4.4)\n\nIndeed, one obtains:\n\u0012\n\u2206E \u223c\n\nS\nS0\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\u00d7\n\n1\n.\n\u2206t\n\n(4.5)\n\nThe delocalizations of two systems with different entropy stay therefore in ratio:\nSj\n\u2206ti\n\u2206Xi\n=\n=\n.\n\u2206tj\n\u2206Xj\nSi\n\n(4.6)\n\nOn the other hand, since what we are considering are subsets of the whole universe, involving an amount of energy, and entropy, much smaller than the one of the universe,\nS(experiment) \u001c S(environment), we can decompose the weight of the whole configuration of the universe which includes our experiment as:\nW = W (environment) \u00d7 W (experiment) = eS(env.) + S(exp.)\n\"\u0012\n\u0013\n\u00132 #\n\u0012\nS(exp.)\nS(exp.)\n+O\n.\n\u2248 W (env.) \u00d7 1 +\nS(env.)\nS(env.)\n\n(4.7)\n\nIsolating the system corresponding to the experiment corresponds to factoring out the contribution of the environment, i.e. discarding the first term in the r.h.s. of 4.7. This allows\nto approximate the ratio of the delocalizations of different systems as:\n\u2206i\nSj\nWj (exp.)\n.\n=\n\u2248\n\u2206j\nSi\nWi (exp.)\n\n(4.8)\n\nOn the other hand, as described in [2] the ratio of the weights of two configurations can\nbe written as the ratio of the volumes of the symmetry group of the energy distributions\nrepresenting the two configurations. Thanks to the factorization 4.7, this property transfers\nalso to the subgroups of the symmetry of the whole configuration which correspond to the\nexperiment, Gi and Gj . The ratio 4.8 can therefore be written as:\n\u2206i\n||Gj ||\n=\n.\n\u2206j\n||Gi ||\n\n(4.9)\n\nThis holds both for the weight of single configurations, and for the mean weight in the case\none deals with a superposition of configurations, as is the case of concrete local experiments.\nIf the concept of mean weight in the case of a superposition of configurations doesn't sound\nsomething unnatural, it is less obvious that one can speak of symmetry groups for a superposition. However, as discussed in [2], any mean weight can be approximated with the weight\nof a discrete group, which is then uniquely identified. This can be assumed to be the weight\nentering in expressions like 4.9.\n5\n\n\fExpression 4.9 says that the higher is the degree of inhomogeneity of the physical configuration, the more its description enters into a deep quantum regime. In this theoretical\nframework, the Uncertainty Principle parametrizes in the form of a bound on the fuzziness\nof observables the fact of being the world a staple of configurations. However, the degree of\nfuzziness (or quantum delocalization) depends on how remote is the configuration one wants\nto consider. According to this interpretation, traditional quantum mechanics considers just\nthe \"first level\" of quantum delocalization, the one in which the details of the geometry of\nthe energy distribution of a microscopic system are neglected. It is therefore not adequate\nfor the description of systems in which this approximation is not valid. Taking into account\nthe effects due to the geometry of space leads us to a regime of quantum geometry. We\ncan call this a regime of quantum gravity, provided we intend that this does not simply\nmean the description of gravitational interactions in terms of the propagation of gravitons,\nquantized in a way possibly similar to, or reminiscent of, the quantization of the electromagnetic field in terms of photons. Quantization of the geometry means, and implies, much\nmore. In particular, it implies that the degree of quantum delocalization of wavefunctions\ndepends on the geometry. One can view this as the result of the fact that quantization of\ngeometry roughly means the introduction of a metric g\u03bc\u03bd which depends on ~; considering\ninstead as a renormalization prescription the geometry of a system to be fixed, and thereby\ninverting the relation g\u03bc\u03bd = g\u03bc\u03bd (~), this equivalently means the introduction of an effective\nmetric-dependent Planck constant: ~ = ~(g\u03bc\u03bd ).\n5\n\nHigh temperature superconductors\n\nAs discussed in [2], considering this effect allows to justify higher critical temperatures\nfor superconductors with a complex lattice structure, and predict their dependence on the\ngeometry of the lattice for a wide class of superconductors, on the base of the same mechanism\nthat allows to explain superconductivity at low temperature: the formation of Cooper's pairs\nas in the BCS theory. Simply, the critical condition for superconductivity regime, i.e. having\nan appropriate number of electrons with an appropriate amount of delocalization, is attained\nat a higher energy because electrons need a lower localization in the space of energies and\nmomenta to attain the same degree of delocalization in space. The ratio of the critical\ntemperatures of two superconductors is therefore expected to be related to the ratio of their\nquantum delocalizations:\n\u2206i\nTci\n,\n(5.1)\nj =\n\u2206j\nTc\nin turn depending, from 4.6, 4.7 and 4.8, on the entropy, and approximately the weight, of\nthe respective geometries:\nTci\nWj\n.\n(5.2)\nj \u2248\nWi\nTc\nComparing this with expression 4.9 we see that 5.2 can be written as:\nTci\n||Gj ||\n.\nj =\n||Gi ||\nTc\n6\n\n(5.3)\n\n\fIn Ref. [2] the ratio of these volumes was approximated by the ratio of the average space\ngradients of energy:\nR\n|\u2207Ei |\nTci\nR ai\n,\n(5.4)\nj \u2248\n|\u2207E\n|\nTc\nj\naj\nwhere ai and aj are the characteristic lengths (in general corresponding to the lattice length)\nof the two superconductors. Roughly speaking, this can be understood by considering that\nthe degree of symmetry measures how smooth the energy distribution is. From expression 5.4\nit has been possible to predict the critical temperature of whole families of high temperature superconductors from the analysis of their crystalline structure, finding a remarkable\nagreement with the temperatures experimentally measured.\n6\n\nBlack holes\n\nA black hole has an entropy equivalent to the one of a three-sphere with radius proportional\nto the Schwarzschild radius. Considered as a standalone object, it is therefore a highest\nsymmetric, highest entropic space. However, when considered as inserted in a larger universe,\none can see that black holes are the most singular configurations of the three-dimensional\nspace. The most entropic configuration of the universe is the one in which the energy units are\nuniformly distributed to form the geometry of a three-sphere. Configurations which contain\nclusters of energy are less symmetric, and therefore less entropic: we can in fact think to\nform energy clusters out of the most homogeneous energy distribution, by moving, one after\nthe other, a certain amount of energy units from their initial position toward certain regions\nof agglomeration. While doing this, we clearly reduce the symmetry of the configuration. In\norder to form a subspace of the whole universe which behaves already in itself like a small\nuniverse, we must move energy units to create a bottleneck (a throttling) till we \"throttle\"\nthe space in a certain point (see figure 1). In this way, we obtain a configuration in which\nthe space is factorized into a black hole times the rest of the universe. This configuration\nhas an entropy which is at most the one of a small three-sphere (the black hole) times a\nthree-sphere formed with the remaining energy of the universe. If the total energy is N , and\nwe take out n energy units to form the black hole, the weight exp S 0 of the new configuration\nsatisfies the following condition:\n0\n2\n2\n< e\u2212N \u00d7 eN 2 .\neS . en \u00d7 e(N \u2212n) \u223c\n\n(6.1)\n\nIt is therefore exponentially suppressed (at least a factor exp \u2212N ) as compared to the configuration of highest entropy of the universe at energy, and time, N . As discussed in [1],\nconfigurations with this weight belong to the bunch of those so remote to describe a deeply\nquantum regime. Indeed, from 4.2 one can see that the highest contribution to the mean\nvalue of the energy density in the region of space of the black hole comes from configurations\nwith higher overall entropy, which however do not describe a black hole. The exponential\nsuppression of the weights implies that the average energy density in the region of the black\nhole is lower than the critical one. This in practice means that the black hole does not exist.\nAccording to this theoretical scenario, the only black hole which can exist is the universe\nitself. For the sake of our present discussion what is important is however to remark that,\n7\n\n\fintended as a configuration describing a subset of the whole universe, a black hole is the less\nentropic one among all the possible in three dimensions, and describes a limit configuration\nof deep quantum regime.\n7\n\nGedankenexperiment\n\nFor our discussion it is not so important whether black holes can really exist, apart from the\nuniverse itself, or not. We are going to treat them as exemplar cases, useful to the purpose\nof understanding real physical cases. What we want to see here is what happens when in the\nuniverse a region of space undergoes a transition to a deep quantum regime, that we ideally\nassume to be a black hole. As discussed in [1], our theoretical scenario implies, in its classical\nlimit, general relativity. From a macroscopic point of view, in order to investigate some large\nscale properties of gravity and geometry of space, not too close to the Schwarzschild horizon,\nwe can therefore use much of what is known about the metric around a classical black hole.\nLet us consider observing from a point (O) an object (A) gravitationally attracted by\nanother one, (B), that we suppose of mass much larger, so that we can neglect its motion,\nconsider it at rest and work with masses instead than with reduced masses. What we see\nis that object (A) moves with an accelerated motion toward (B). Let us now suppose to\nshrink the radius of (B) beyond the Schwarzschild value, i.e. to the point of making of it a\nblack hole (for the sake of our discussion, it is not important here to inquire whether this\ntransformation is physically possible, and, in the case, in which way and as a consequence of\nwhat this can occur). Owing to the created Schwarzschild singularity in the new metric, the\nmotion of (A) will now appear to an external observer to undergo a deceleration, because\nthe time it takes for an object in order to reach the surface of the black hole diverges. Saying\nthat (A) needs an infinite time to get to a point placed at a (seemingly) well defined, and\nfinite, distance means saying that (A) gets stopped, until it is at rest, at the Schwarzschild\nsurface. As seen from (O), the situation is therefore that some kind of force has been created,\nwhich opposes to gravity. This new force has all the properties of gravity, in the sense that it\nseems to act with twice the strength on objects with twice the mass of (A). It has therefore\nall the characteristics of a \"gravity screening\".\nThe surface at the horizon of a black hole is a limit example of extremely non-classical,\n\"quantum\" geometry. However, although concerning a rather unphysical situation, this\nthought experiment helps us in understanding how the presence of a very low-entropic configuration of space acts on the overall geometry in a way to \"create\" a kind of gravity\nscreening force, or, in dynamical cases, anti-gravity impulse. In our scenario, the dynamics\nis ruled by the \"law\" of entropy, in the sense that at any time the universe is predominantly\ngiven by the configuration of highest entropy in the phase space. Instead of speaking of\n\"forces\", \"anti-forces\" and similar concepts, the best way to analyze the behavior of a system in response to a certain event, is to compare entropies of configurations. In order to see\nwhether after the creation of the black hole (A) is further attracted by (B), or starts to be\nrepelled, we have to see whether a motion toward (B) leads to an increase of the entropy of\nthe configuration, or to a decrease. In section 3 we have justified the gravitational attraction with the fact that, by moving toward each other, two objects reciprocally increase the\n8\n\n\fentropy of their configuration, because in their phase space, besides the entropy due to the\nenergy distribution of each single object, one adds also the entropy due to the energy of the\nother object: the \"space density of entropy\" increases. In falling toward a black hole, an\nobject enters in a region of space which corresponds to configurations the more and more\nremote in the phase space. The object itself becomes the less and less classical. Its entropy\ndecreases. When going away from the black hole, the entropy of the configuration it corresponds to instead increases. This is in our framework the origin of the \"repulsion\" the\nobject appears to experience. Indeed, the true effective motion depends also on all the rest\nof the universe, to begin with on the closer environment. In traditional words, this translates\nin terms of \"initial conditions\", \"continuity of the motion\", acceleration and deceleration,\ngravitational attraction of other bodies, etc... In practice, the balance of entropies doesn't\nlead in this case to a net repulsion, but to a decelerated fall of (A) toward (B), to the point\nthat, before reaching the horizon, i.e. even before being completely stopped in its motion,\n(A) looses any property of a classical object, and cannot be anymore described in the same\nterms as it was before. The reason of a deceleration instead of a net escape from the black\nhole is that, before becoming a non-classical object, the phase space of (A) still feels an\nincrease of entropy by falling toward the black hole, due to the classical part of the energy\ndistribution of (B) (the \"gravitational field\" of (B), in classical words).\n8\n\nGravity screening and gravity impulse in high temperature superconductors\n\nIn our scenario, there is no net separation between classical and quantum mechanical regime:\nthese two levels of the physical description are sued together in a seamless way. This in\nparticular means that the gravitational screening occurring in the case of the black hole\nis not a property specific of black holes, but, in a certain amount, is expected to occur in\nevery physical system. In general, the gravitational attraction does not depend only on the\nmass of the object, but is affected also by a certain amount of screening, depending on the\nconfiguration of the object: more singular (=less entropic) configurations should present a\nhigher degree of screening. What distinguishes the situation of a so-called classical object\nfrom a quantum one is that the entropy of the classical object is very large, to the point that,\nin comparison, entropy variations depending on the shape are negligible. As a consequence,\nnegligible is also the size of the gravity screening as compared to the gravitational force.\nQuantum systems correspond by definition to less entropic configurations, and the gravity\nscreening is therefore comparatively higher. They are therefore good candidates for the\ndetection of this effect.\nIf the case of a black hole is just an ideal case, a very concrete physical case of region of\nspace which is very remote in the phase space (i.e. much less entropic than its environment),\nalthough not so extremely remote as the surface of a black hole, is a superconductor with\nvery complicated lattice structure, like those considered in section 5. Experiments have\nbeen carried out by Podkletnov with a rotating YBCO disc: under appropriate conditions,\na loss of weight is observed in objects hanging above the superconductor. In particular, the\ngravity-screening effect results to be enhanced during transitions of the configuration of the\nsuperconductor. This agrees with our expectation that what matters for the production of\n\n9\n\n\fthe effect is the creation of a region with a very singular geometry, i.e. of very low entropy\nin the phase space. Such a condition can be attained by considering a superconductor with\na high gradient of the energy distribution, like the high temperature superconductors, in a\ndeeply quantum regime, i.e. below the critical temperature and with accelerated currents.\nWhy does the acceleration correspond to a configuration of even lower entropy? In section 3\nwe said that in our framework the dynamics underlying the gravitational attraction is ruled\nby the \"law\" of highest entropy. Since the dominant configuration, the one which the most\ncontributes to the mean value of the observables, is the one of highest entropy, at any time\none produces somewhere a change leading to a decrease of the entropy, from an effective point\nof view what happens is that the system responds tending to counterbalance this action by\nchanging its configuration toward an increase of entropy wherever possible. For instance,\nif we create a black hole, an object falling toward it decelerates because it tends to lower\nthe decrease of entropy produced by its falling into a region of very low entropy, and so on.\nThe equivalence principle, i.e. the equivalence of gravitational attraction and acceleration,\nin our framework is nothing else than the statement that producing an acceleration means\nforcing a system to change its entropy. In practice, this means that by inducing on it an\naccelerated motion, we force the system into a regime of lower entropy, to which it responds\nwith a tendency to counterbalance this effect by increasing its entropy as in the case of the\ngravitational attraction. In the case the superconductor, forcing it to a configuration in\nwhich the currents and its whole lattice structure (its whole geometry) is accelerated means\nthat we produce on it a configuration of even lower entropy, therefore even more remote\nin the phase space. From 5.2\u20135.4 we see that at all the effects it is like having increased\nthe average energy gradient. Creating a region of very low entropy produces therefore a\n\"gravitational response\" similar to the one of the black hole. Indeed, such a kind of response\nis to be expected for any kind of similar situation, and is not in principle related to the fact\nof having a superconductor: important is the creation of a region with a deeply quantum\nbehavior. The response can occur everywhere in the environment: the only requirement is\nthat it most efficiently compensates the decrease of entropy. The direction in which it is\ndetected depends therefore on conditions such as the symmetries of the problem and of the\nenvironment, which state where a change of configuration is possible, and how is the best (=\nmost entropic) way. In the case of a superconductor rotating around the z-axes, since on the\nplane of the rotation the superconductor is constrained (that means forces are balanced and\nforbid any deformation) the only change of the system can occur along the direction of the\nrotation axes, i.e. the vertical axes, orthogonal to the superconducting layers. The result is a\nscreening of the gravitational attraction acting on objects hanging over the superconductor.\nAs long as we neglect border effects, on the plane of the disc the layers can approximately\nbe considered of infinite extension and the problem reduces to a one-dimensional one. The\nregion of space expected to be affected by the screening is therefore a cylinder, a column\nwith the same diameter of the superconductor. The range of the effect, namely how far\nshould it be detectable, depends once again on the geometry of the physical system and its\nenvironment, i.e. on how heavy can be the changes in the geometry close to superconductor,\ncounterbalancing the reduction of entropy on the superconductor. We expect that in the\nideal case of absolutely \"rigid\" system, the screening can be effective even very far from\nthe superconductor. Indeed, like in the case of the black hole, this effect is of gravitational\n10\n\n\ftype. As one can also see in figure 2, the strength of the screening depends on the amount of\nreduction of entropy the repulsion is aimed to compensate. When this quantity is fixed, the\namount of the response at the level of change in the geometry is fixed. This means: what is\nfixed is the acceleration, not its translation in terms of force. Let us see this more in detail.\nAccelerating the superconducting disc means making its configuration to weight less in the\nphase space, by an amount approximately given by the ratio of the symmetry groups after\nand before the acceleration:\n0\n||G0SC ||\nWSC\n\u2248\n.\n(8.1)\nWSC\n||GSC ||\nThe system superconductor+environment+probe will re-act in a way to compensate this\nloss of weight by a move intended to locally increase the weight somewhere else. The only\naction the system is free to do is to change the weight of the probe, i.e. push it away from\nthe superconductor (see figure 2), in order to increase its entropy by producing a smoother\n(more symmetric) configuration, as the result of a decrease of the mean value of the energy\ngradient. Owing to the factorization of the phase space, this compensation will be obtained\nby changes leading to a ratio of local weights inverse to 8.1:\nR\n0\n||G0env.+probe ||\nWprobe\n|\u2207Eenv.+probe |\nWSC\n\u2248\n\u2248 R\n=\n.\n(8.2)\n0\n0\nWprobe\nWSC\n||Genv.+probe ||\n|\u2207Eenv.+probe\n|\nBeing the probe a rigid body, this implies a fixed change of the relative gravitational weight\nof the probe, the same for any probe, as fixed by the ratio 8.1. Saying that we have a\nfixed amount of relative change precisely means that the amount of change is fixed once it\nis divided by the mass of the probe. That means, what is fixed is not the force but the field\nstrength, precisely what happens in the case of the screening produced by the sudden creation\nof a black hole: a gravitational screening. Of course, this is a very simplified representation\nof the physical situation, which is composed by many other pieces. For instance, the probe\nhangs from a balance, so we should include in our considerations also the balance, etc...\nHowever, a little thought about the fact that all forces are at equilibrium should convince\nthe reader that this simplification catches the main point about what is happening. Giving\na quantitative prediction of the screening effect is quite hard, but we can at least attempt to\nestimate a relative effect. What we expect is that it should be relatively simple to predict\nthe change in the strength of the gravity screening effect when substituting a superconductor\nwith another one. The difficulty in the theoretical analysis is in the fact that, differently\nfrom the situations considered in [2], here we are going to consider superconductors in an\naccelerated state. Namely, we are going to modify the entropy of their configuration, which\nnow does no more depend roughly on just their lattice structure. Nevertheless, with a\ncertain degree of approximation we can assume that, precisely owing to the implementation\nof the equivalence principle, the acceleration imposed on the superconductor is theoretically\nequivalent to a modification of the close environment of the superconductor, as produced by\nthe presence of an object of large mass. This equivalence should be regarded only as a way\nof parametrizing the changes in the entropy of the configuration of the superconductor plus\nits close environment, i.e. not in order to treat the whole experiment as being subjected to\na modification equivalent to introducing the presence of an object of large mass, something\nthat would gravitationally attract also the probe. We expect it to be reasonable to write\n11\n\n\fthe contribution of the rotation in terms of an equivalent energy gradient term \u2206acc. , to be\nadded to the energy gradient of the superconductor:\nZ\nZ\n|\u2207E| \u2192\n|\u2207E| + \u2206acc. ,\n(8.3)\na\n\na\n\n\u0012Z\n\u2206acc. \u2261 \"\n\n\u0013\n|\u2207E|\u2261 acc. \" .\n\n(8.4)\n\nThe weight in the phase space of the superconductor subjected to a rotational acceleration\nshould then be:\n1\n0\n\u2248 \u221dR\n.\n(8.5)\nWSC\n|\u2207E| + \u2206acc.\na\nThe ratio of the weights of two different materials subjected to the same acceleration should\nthen be:\n\u0010\n\u0011\nR\n\u2206acc.\n0\nWSC0 1 + W 0\n0\n|\u2207E| + \u2206acc.\nWSC\nSC\na0\nR\n\u0010\n\u0011.\n\u2248\n(8.6)\n=\n0\nWSC0\n|\u2207E| + \u2206acc.\nWSC 1 + \u2206Wacc.\na\nSC\nFrom 8.2 we obtain that the weight of the probe should be:\n0\nWprobe\nWSC\n0\n\u2248\n.\n0\n0\nWprobe\nWSC\n\n(8.7)\n\n0\nWprobe /Wprobe\nis the ratio of the weights in the phase space; however, due to the particular\nconditions of the problem, this should effectively reflect in the ratio of the two relative losses\nof gravitational weights:\n\u2206Wg\nWprobe\n\u2248\n.\n(8.8)\n0\nWprobe\n\u2206Wg0\n\nFrom 8.8, 8.7, 8.6 and 5.2 we obtain therefore:\nh\ni\n\u2206acc.\n0\n1\n+\n\u2206Wg\nWSC\ni,\n\u2248 rT h\n\u2206Wg\n1 + r\u22121 \u2206acc.\nT\n\n(8.9)\n\nWSC\n\nwhere we have set rT \u2261 Tc0 /Tc , the ratio of the critical temperatures of the two superconductors. Since \u2206acc. > 0 superconductors with higher critical temperature are expected to\nproduce a larger gravitational screening. The ratio \u2206acc. /WSC is not known, but it can be obtained by plugging in 8.9 experimental data from two materials; in this way, this expression\nallows then to obtain quantitative predictions, to be tested for any other material.\nAn effect analogous to the gravity screening is the impulse that seems to be radiated by a\nsuperconductor of the same type, when it undergoes an electric discharge, as described in [4],\n[5]. Here the singularity of the configuration, that substitutes the accelerated motion of the\nsuperconductor, is produced by the high electric gradient created in a short time. The basic\nidea is however the same. To be noticed is the instantaneous character of the modification of\n12\n\n\fthe geometry of space. Sometimes it is a misleading idea to think that in quantum gravity\nmodifications of the geometry are propagated/mediated by gravitons, and therefore they\nshould obey the laws of any kind of radiation 2 . As pointed out is [1], quantum mechanics\nis basically tachyonic. What is not tachyonic, and is bound by the speed of light, is the\ntransfer of information. In other words, no matter of what the speed at which the quantum\nmodification of the geometry propagates, we can only get the information about the results\nof the experiment at a speed no higher than that of light.\n\n2\n\nFrom a classical point of view, one may say that gravitons can be considered a good approximation of the\ndescription of quantum gravity only for very weak gravitational fields. In the case of electrodynamics things\nwork better, because the electric field is not charged, and the free photon remains a reasonable approximation\nin a wider range of situations.\n\n13\n\n\fReferences\n[1] A.
