However, a quantitative comparison\nbetween theory and experiment often suffers from the\nfact that the interaction parameter g of the TLL is not\nvery well known and does not affect the DC conductance\nand the shot noise of clean wires attached to Fermi liquid leads. As a hallmark of the TLL model has served\nthe power law dependence of the nonlinear conductance\nof impure wires with respect to temperature and/or applied voltage, which has been observed in transport measurements in semiconductor quantum wires1,2 as well as\nin nanotubes.3 However, some doubts in the determination of g often remain, since dynamical Coulomb blockade\nleads as well to a power law when the system is embedded in an ohmic environment.4 It has been shown recently\nthat both the intrinsic interactions and the environmental resistance enter on equal footing in g.5 Thus, it is\nimportant to have alternative ways to measure g in order\nto validate the existence of TLL systems in nature.\nCrucial ingredients, which have been disregarded in\nearlier theoretical work on transport in TLLs,6,7 are the\nfinite wire length and the role of the electron reservoirs.\nA first step towards a better understanding of such systems has been taken by modelling the reservoirs as onedimensional non-interacting leads, introducing the inhomogeneous TLL (ITLL) model.8,9,10 It has been shown\nthat the DC conductance of the ITLL is independent\nof the electron interaction strength. The analysis of\n\nthis result has lead to a new phenomenon: a momentum conserving reflection at the contacts due to strong\nelectronic correlations in the wire and their absence in\nthe leads.8 This effect is similar to the Andreev reflections at a metal-superconductor contact.11 Apparently,\na finite wire behaves as an Andreev-type resonator for\nplasmon excitations: An electron incident from a contact is transmitted in a series of current spikes, which\nsum up to the flux of an electron, so that ultimately the\nincident particle is perfectly transmitted. This dynamics gives rise to nontrivial correlation functions.11,12,13,14\nThe ITLL model has also been applied recently to study\nthe effects of the Fermi liquid leads on tunneling from an\nSTM tip into a nanotube.15 Apart from the ITLL model,\nthe finite length of an interacting quantum wire (QW) is\nalso taken into account in the approach of open boundary bosonization16 . However, there the wire is taken as\na disconnected object with sharp edges.\nIn the presence of an impurity in the QW, the ITLL\nmodel in its standard form8,9,10 can only be treated perturbatively for weak (or strong) impurity strength. As far\nas the calculation of the average current is concerned, this\nproblem can in principle be eluded by modelling the presence of non-interacting leads through radiative boundary conditions.17 These have been combined with methods of refermionization18 and integrable field theories19\nto obtain the exact current voltage characteristics. The\nnon-perturbative analysis of Refs. [18,19] is restricted,\nup to now, to an infinitely long wire, and it is currently not clear whether this approach can also be applied to the calculation of current fluctuations. For a\nfinite one-dimensional wire at low energies, an alternative formulation of the radiative boundary conditions in\n\n\f2\nterms of operators instead of expectation values has been\nproposed.20 This approach recovers the quasi-Andreev\nreflections, and could perhaps also enable a treatment of\nthe noise.21\nBoth the voltage dependence of the differential conductance and the frequency dependence of the spectrum\nof the noise are expected to provide valuable information\non interaction effects in a finite length QW. In Ref. [22]\nwe have determined the nonlinear current-voltage characteristics of a QW with an impurity for the case of zero\ntemperature, taking its finite length explicitly into account through the ITLL model. The I \u2212V characteristics\nshows interaction-dependent oscillations that are due to\ninterference effects between the Andreev-type reflections\nat the wire-lead contacts and the backscattering at the\nimpurity site. In the present article, we analyze in detail\nhow these oscillations are modified at finite temperature.\nFor a QW with applied voltage V at temperature T there\nis now apart from eV and kB T a third relevant energy\nscale ~vF /gL, where the ballistic frequency vF /gL is the\nratio of the plasmon velocity vF /g and the length of the\nwire L. As an important consequence of this new energy\nscale, the current as a function of T at V = 0 and the\ncurrent as a function of V at T = 0 are not simply related\nto each other by an interchange of eV and kB T as it is\nthe case in the homogeneous TLL.\nThe main purpose of the present work, however, is to\ngo beyond the investigation of DC properties of ITLL\nsystems by looking at the finite frequency (FF) current\nnoise. Much of the recent interest in noise comes from\nthe fact that shot noise may allow to determine the effective charge that is backscattered off an impurity in the\nQW.23 Due to the dominance of 1/f noise at low frequencies, shot noise is never really measured at zero frequency,\nbut only down to the kHz range. This raises the question\non the influence of a finite measurement frequency on the\nshot noise level. This issue has been addressed theoretically for a four-terminal fractional quantum Hall edge\nstate geometry.24 However, the analysis was restricted\nto chiral TLLs at zero temperature and infinite system\nsize, which effectively corresponds to a vanishing ballistic frequency vF /gL. In contrast, as will be shown in the\npresent paper, for non-chiral TLLs the ratio between \u03c9\nand vF /gL crucially affects the properties of FF noise.\nFor this reason, it is essential to adopt a model which\ntakes the finite length of the system into account. Here,\nwe address this problem within the ITLL model.\nFrom an experimental point of view, there is an advantage in studying FF noise as compared to the AC conductance. While recent theoretical work8,20,25 has predicted\nthat the AC conductance exhibits Andreev-type oscillations, the high frequency range of these oscillations cannot easily be explored in experiments. The problem is\nthat the frequency \u03c9AC of the reservoir potential in AC\nmeasurements must be low enough to ensure that inelastic processes are sufficiently efficient to establish quasiequilibrium distributions as assumed in the theory.20,25\nThis means that \u03c9AC \u03c4in \u226a 1, where \u03c4in is the character-\n\nistic time for inelastic thermalization processes. However,\nthe frequency \u03c9 that appears in the expression of the FF\nnoise derived below is not limited by such assumptions.\nFurthermore, it is possible to measure FF noise in a DC\nbiased circuit.\nIn the regime \u03c9 \u226a vF /gL, the shot noise of an ITLL\nsystem in the presence of a weak backscattering potential\nhas been shown to be given by a g-independent classical\nSchottky formula S = 2eIBS , where IBS is the backscattering current.26,27 Hence, the shot noise is proportional\nto the electron charge e. In contrast, in the homogeneous TLL model, the fractional charge extracted from\nthe ratio of the noise and the backscattering current in\nthe weak backscattering limit is given by e\u2217 = eg and\nthus depends on the interaction parameter g.28 This has\nessentially been confirmed in shot noise measurements on\nfractional quantum Hall edge state devices at filling fraction \u03bd = 1/3.29,30 However, these systems are described\nby the chiral TLL model, where right and left movers are\nspatially separated and the effect of contact electrodes is\nquite different from the non-chiral case discussed here.\nNow, the question arises, if it is possible to observe the\nfractional charge e\u2217 = eg also in QW realizations such as\ncleaved edge overgrowth QWs or SWNTs. As we have\nshown recently31 , at frequencies \u03c9 \u2248 vF /gL, the effective\ncharge extracted by averaging the FF noise in ITLL systems over a frequency range is indeed the quasiparticle\ncharge e\u2217 = eg and not the electron charge e. The origin\nof this behavior is easily understood: On the one hand,\nfor \u03c9 \u226a vF /gL, the noise probes current correlations on\nlong time scales allowing for a large number of scattering\nprocesses (at the impurity and Andreev-type reflections\nat the boundaries to the leads). Thus, the noise probes\nthe current correlations of the non-interacting leads with\na complicated scatterer \u2013 the interacting QW and the\nimpurity. On the other hand, in the case \u03c9 \u2248 vF /gL,\nintrinsic spectral properties of the QW determine the FF\nnoise. Here, we go beyond the analysis of Ref. [31] by explicitly considering the influence of finite temperature on\nthe equilibrium as well as non-equilibrium current noise\nof a finite-length QW coupled to electron reservoirs. Our\ngeneral result for the FF noise of a wire with arbitrary\nlength L describes the crossover between the shot noise\nresults for homogeneous TLL28 and ITLL systems.26,27\nThe observability of the fractional charge backscattered\nat an impurity in a carbon nanotube has also recently\nbeen discussed for a four-terminal setup.32 However, the\nHamiltonian used in Ref. [32] does not take the role of\nthe Fermi liquid leads fully into account and entails a\nfactor of g in the shot noise strength even at \u03c9 \u2192 0 in\ncontrast to the findings in Refs. [26,27].\nOn the experimental side, there has been considerable\nprogress in the study of FF noise, recently. The FF\nnoise of an electrically driven two-state system has been\nmeasured,33 and the high frequency current noise in a\ndiffusive mesoscopic conductor has been observed.34 The\nlow frequency regime has also been explored experimentally: Shot noise has been measured in bundles of carbon\n\n\f3\nnanotubes35 and in SWNT.36 However, the nature of the\nsystem in the former case and the analysis of data in the\nlatter case do not allow to conclude whether the theoretical predictions26,27 on the shot noise in non-chiral TLL\nsystems have been confirmed or not, so that further work\nis needed.\nThe article is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the ITLL model. Then, in Sec. III, we first discuss\nthe influence of the finite length and electron-electron interactions on the I \u2212 V characteristics. Subsequently,\nin Sec. IV, we present results on the FF noise in ITLL\nsystems and discuss various limits, where we can make\ncontact with earlier work, in particular, the shot noise\nof the homogeneous TLL model. Finally, we conclude in\nSec. V. Technical details are given in the Appendices.\nII.\n\nMODEL\n\nWe model the physical system by the Hamiltonian\nH = H0 + HB + HV ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere H0 describes the interacting wire, the leads and\ntheir mutual contacts, HB accounts for the electronimpurity interaction, and HV contains the electrochemical bias applied to the wire. Explicitly, we have\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n~vF \u221e\n1\n2\n2\nH0 =\n(2)\n(\u2202x \u03a6) ,\ndx \u03a0 + 2\n2 \u2212\u221e\ng (x)\n\u221a\n(3)\nHB = \u03bb cos [ 4\u03c0\u03a6(x0 , t) + 2kF x0 ] ,\nZ \u221e\ndx\n\u221a \u03bc(x) \u2202x \u03a6(x, t) .\n(4)\nHV = \u2212\n\u03c0\n\u2212\u221e\nHere, \u03a6(x, t) is the standard Bose field operator\nin bosonization and \u03a0(x, t) its conjugate momentum\ndensity.37 Eq. (2) describes the (spinless) ITLL mentioned in the introduction, which is known to capture the\nphysical features of a QW with short-ranged (screened)\nCoulomb interaction connected to metallic leads through\nadiabatic contacts. The interaction parameter g(x) is\nspace-dependent and its value is g in the bulk of the\nwire, 1 in the bulk of the leads, and supposed to change\nsmoothly from 1 to g at the contacts. A schematic view of\nthis model is shown in Fig. 1. The variation of g(x) is assumed to occur within a characteristic smoothing length\nLs . The profile of the function g(x) then identifies two\nenergy scales EL = ~vF /gL and Es = ~vF /Ls , associated with the length L of the wire and the smoothing\nlength Ls . We assume here that Ls \u226b \u03bbF where \u03bbF is the\nelectron Fermi wavelength. Under these conditions, the\nelectron-electron interaction in the bosonized language\nremains quadratic in the field \u03a6, and no backscattering\nterm arises at the wire-lead interfaces, as it is expected\nfor adiabatic contacts.\nWe also consider the situation Ls \u226a L, so that EL \u226a\nEs . In this case the QW has a well defined length, as it\nis typically the case for carbon nanotubes contacted by\n\nmetallic leads.38,39,40 The energy scale Es is then much\nlarger than the relevant energy scales that must be considered to describe the effects of the finite wire length\non the average current and the noise. The precise form\nof the variation of g(x) at the contacts from g to 1 is\ntherefore not physically relevant to our purposes, and it\nis consistent to simplify the calculations by adopting a\nstep-like function, namely g(x) = g if x is in the wire\n(i.e. if |x| < L/2) and g(x) = 1 if x is in the leads (i.e. if\n|x| > L/2), cf. Fig. 1. We mention that the behavior at\nenergies of order Es has been addressed by Kleimann et\nal. in their study of a one-dimensional quantum dot.41\nThe value vF appearing in Eq. (2), although being of\nthe same order as the (equilibrium) bare Fermi velocity\nof the system, may not exactly coincide with the latter. Indeed, as customary when adopting a continuum\nlimit of a lattice model, the actual value of vF can be\nrenormalized by the electron density as well as by the\ninteraction.42 In a more detailed model of the ITLL, one\ncould also consider the plasmon velocity v as an independent parameter and replace vF /g by v in Eq. (2).8,11\nThen, one would take the possible renormalization of v\nby irrelevant processes, such as Umklapp scattering, into\naccount. As our final results are essentially unaffected\nby such a sophistication of the model, we will stick to\nthe simple ITLL given by Eq. (2) and assume that the\nrelation v = vF /g describes the interaction dependence\nof the plasmon velocity.\nEq. (3) is the 2kF backscattering term at the impurity site x0 , and introduces a strong non-linearity in the\nfield \u03a6. Near the low-energy fixed-point of the model this\nterm represents a relevant perturbation. As mentioned in\nthe introduction, we will consider here the weak backscattering limit, which amounts to treating Eq. (3) as a perturbation. The conditions on the coupling constant \u03bb in\norder for this perturbative approach to be reliable have\nbeen discussed in Ref. [22] and are recalled below. In\npassing, we mention that impurity scattering also yields\na forward scattering term, which has been omitted, because it is unimportant for the transport properties studied below.\nFinally, Eq. (4) describes the coupling to the electrochemical bias due to the leads. In most experiments,\nleads are normal 2D or 3D metals, and a detailed description of them would require the standard Fermi liquid\nmodel. However, since we are interested in properties of\nthe wire, such a detailed description of the leads would in\nfact be superfluous. One can account for their main effect, the applied bias voltage at the contacts, by treating\nthem as non-interacting systems (g = 1), as mentioned\nabove. The only essential properties originating from the\nCoulomb interaction that one needs to retain are i) the\npossibility to shift the band-bottom of the leads, and ii)\nelectroneutrality in the leads.27\nTherefore, the function \u03bc(x) appearing in Eq. (4),\nwhich describes the externally tunable electro-chemical\n\n\f4\nfirst provide a thorough description of the average current. As already mentioned above, some results on the\ncurrent at T = 0 have been published previously.22 In the\npresent section we shall summarize these results, and, in\naddition, generalize them to the case of finite temperature.\nSince we explicitly take into account the finite wire\nlength L, an additional energy scale comes into play,\nnamely the ballistic frequency\n\u03c9L = vF /gL\n\nFIG. 1: The upper part of the figure shows a QW with\nan impurity adiabatically coupled to Fermi liquid leads. In\norder to allow for a finite bias, the leads are held on different\nelectro-chemical potentials \u03bcL and \u03bcR . The middle part of\nthe figure shows the actual variation of the TLL parameter g\nalong the wire-leads system in the ITLL model, and the lower\npart of the figure its simplification under the assumption that\n\u03bbF \u226a Ls \u226a L.\n\nbias, is taken as piecewise constant11\n\uf8f1\n\u03bcL for x < \u2212 L2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u03bc(x) = 0 for |x| < L2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u03bcR for x > + L2\ncorresponding to an applied voltage\n.\nV = (\u03bcL \u2212 \u03bcR ) / e .\n\n(6)\n\nWe recall that in the absence of the non-linear term (3),\nthe current turns out to be exactly linear with respect to\nthe applied voltage V (see e.g. Ref. [8]).\nIn bosonization, the current operator is related to the\nBosonic field \u03a6 through\ne\nj(x, t) = \u221a \u2202t \u03a6(x, t) .\n(7)\n\u03c0\nThe finite frequency noise S(x, y, \u03c9) is defined as\nZ \u221e\ndtei\u03c9t h{\u2206j(x, t), \u2206j(y, 0)}i ,\nS(x, y, \u03c9) =\n\nof the plasmonic excitations in the wire. The average\nvalue of the current may be written as I = I0 \u2212IBS , where\nI0 is the current the system would exhibit in the absence\nof the impurity, and IBS is the backscattering current.\nIn App. A we show that for arbitrary impurity strength\nand time-dependent applied voltage the backscattering\ncurrent takes the form\n\u221a Z\n~ \u03c0 +\u221e \u2032\ndt \u03c30 (x, t; x0 , t\u2032 ) hjB (x0 , t\u2032 )i\u2192\nIBS (x, t) = \u2212 2\ne\n\u2212\u221e\n(10)\nHere \u03c30 (x, t; y, t\u2032 ) is the local conductivity of the clean\nwire (see App. A, Eq. (A27))8,11,20,25 , and jB (x0 , t) is\nthe \"backscattering current operator\", defined as\njB (x0 , t) = \u2212\n\n(5)\n\n(8)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere { , } denotes the anticommutator and \u2206j(x, t) =\nj(x, t) \u2212 hj(x, t)i is the current fluctuation operator.\nIII. FINITE LENGTH EFFECTS IN THE\nCURRENT VOLTAGE CHARACTERISTICS\n\nIn order to understand the behavior of current fluctuations, especially in the shot noise limit, it is crucial to\n\n(9)\n\ne \u03b4HB\n[\u03a6 + A0 ] .\n~ \u03b4\u03a6(x0 , t)\n\n(11)\n\nA0 (x0 , t) is the field shift emerging when one gauges\naway the applied voltage, as done in App. A. As before, x0 is the position of the impurity. Finally, h. . .i\u2192\ndenotes an average with respect to the Hamiltonian\nH\u2192 = H0 [\u03a6] + HB [\u03a6 + A0 ], which includes the shift A0\nas defined in Eq. (A26). In the case of a DC applied voltage V , A0 (x0 , t) only depends on time (see Eq. (A31)).\nThen, I0 = (e2 /h)V and IBS are independent of position\nand time.\nThroughout this article we shall mostly deal with the\nlimit of weak backscattering at the impurity. It is well\nknown that in this regime the shot noise is directly proportional to the backscattering current IBS . It is thus\nworthwhile focussing on the latter, rather than on the\ntotal current I. We perform a perturbative expansion in\nthe impurity strength \u03bb appearing in Eq. (3). This is well\ngrounded whenever either of the three energy scales eV ,\nkB T , or ~\u03c9L is much larger than \u03bb.\nIt can be shown (see App. A, Eq. (A33) for details)\nthat for a DC voltage Eq.

For arbitrary interaction strength 0 < g \u2264 1,\napplied voltage V , and temperature T , Eq. (12) can readily be evaluated numerically.\nLet us first recall the behavior at T = 0.22 In this\ncase, Eq. (12) for IBS simplifies, because only the term\nwith 's = +' contributes, and Eq. (7) of Ref. [22] is recovered. In Fig. 2 we have plotted IBS for the interaction strength g = 0.25 (a typical value for SWNTs) and\nfor two different impurity positions, namely \u03be0 = 0 and\n\u03be0 = \u00b10.2, where \u03be0 is the relative position within the\nwire, i.e. \u03be0 = x0 /L. Notice that the current only depends on the absolute value |\u03be0 | of the impurity shift off\nthe center, and not on the direction.\nThe current exhibits oscillations as a function of the\nDC voltage V .22 The origin of these oscillations can be\nunderstood from the following two effects: An adiabatic\nconnection between two TLLs with different interaction\nparameters (in our case g in the wire and 1 in the leads),\ncauses partial reflections of plasmonic excitations at the\ncontact region (Andreev-type reflections); furthermore,\nin presence of an impurity, an applied DC voltage can\nbe regarded as a time-dependent \"phase shifter\" located\nat the impurity site (see the exponential factor ei\u03c90 t in\nEq. (12)). This is due to the fact that the applied voltage\ncan be gauged away into a phase factor of the electron\noperators (see App. A Eqs. (A12), (A20), and (A21) for\ndetails).\nIn view of the above observations one can sketch\nthe following scenario: The plasmonic excitations are\nbackscattered by the impurity, driven towards the contacts where they exhibit further partial Andreev-type reflections, and then come back to the impurity with a\nphase difference ei\u03c90 tB , where tB is the ballistic time to\npropagate from the impurity to one of the contacts and\nback. This phase difference is responsible for interference\n\n0\n\n0.0\n\n2\n\neV /\n\n\u00d1\u03c9\n\nL\n\n\u03c9L\n\n4\n\n15\n20\n\n5\n\nk\n\nT\nB\n\n/\u00d1\n\nFIG. 3: The backscattering current (same units as in Fig. 2)\nas a function of voltage and temperature.\n\neffects, which can be tuned from constructive to destructive nature by varying the DC voltage and/or the length\nof the wire. This is basically the mechanism causing the\noscillatory behavior. The typical period of the oscillation of the current as a function of the voltage is indeed\n\u2206V = 2\u03c0~\u03c9L /e. As can be seen from Fig. 2, when the\nimpurity is located away from the middle (i.e |\u03be0 | 6= 0),\nthe ballistic times to reach the left and right contacts are\ndifferent, and therefore one observes two different oscillation frequencies as in the dotted curve of Fig. 2.\nImportantly, these current oscillations are a combined\neffect of the impurity, the finite-length, and the interaction in the wire, which causes the Andreev-type reflections at the contacts. As soon as these reflections are\nsuppressed (either because the interaction in the wire is\nvery weak, or the length is sent to infinity) the oscillations disappear.\nLet us now consider the case of finite temperature\nT > 0. Thermal fluctuations are expected to induce\ndecoherence in the interference effects described above.\nIn Fig. 3, the backscattering current IBS is shown as a\nfunction of both temperature and voltage, again for the\ncase g = 0.25. For simplicity we have chosen an impurity\nlocated in the middle, \u03be0 = 0. As one can see, when kB T\nbecomes comparable with the energy scale ~\u03c9L associated with the ballistic frequency, the oscillations start to\nbe smeared out. Importantly, the existence of a third\nenergy scale ~\u03c9L (apart from kB T and eV ) destroys the\nsimple scaling behavior of the current as a function of V\nand/or T known from the homogeneous TLL. More precisely, the current as a function of V at T = 0 and the\ncurrent as a function of T at V = 0 behave very differently at intermediate energy scales, cf. Fig. 3. The same\npowerlaws for IBS (V ) at T = 0 as for IBS (T ) at V = 0\nonly arise in the limit L \u2192 \u221e, i.e. if eV \u226b ~\u03c9L in the\nformer case and kB T \u226b ~\u03c9L in the latter case.\n\n\f6\nFig. 4 shows an interesting behavior of IBS at fixed\nvoltage V as a function of temperature that is due to\na combined effect of Andreev-type reflections and temperature induced decoherence. In that figure, we focus\non a voltage value Vmin corresponding to destructive interference at T = 0, i.e. to one of the current minima\nin Fig. 2 (solid curve). If the temperature is increased,\none first observes for kB T . ~\u03c9L an increase of IBS , due\nto thermal decoherence of the destructive interference effect. Then, for kB T \u226b ~\u03c9L , IBS decreases, so that a\nmaximum of IBS as a function of T is observed when the\nvoltage is near Vmin .\nThe above results have been obtained by means of\na numerical evaluation of Eq. (12). However, it is\nalso possible to derive analytical results for IBS , in\nparticular in the limit eV \u226b ~\u03c9L . In this case the two\ntemperature regimes kB T \u226a ~\u03c9L and kB T \u226b ~\u03c9L can\nbe distinguished.\n(i) In the case kB T \u226a ~\u03c9L \u226a eV , it is convenient to\nrewrite IBS as\nst\nIBS = IBS\n(V ) [1 + fBS (u, \u0398, \u03be0 )],\n\ne2 V \u03c0 2\n(\u03bb/~\u03c9c )2\n)=\nh \u0393(2g) (eV /~\u03c9c )2(1\u2212g)\n\nosc\nfBS\n(u, \u0398, \u03be0 ) =\n\n(14)\n\ne2 V \u03c0 2\n)=\nh \u0393(2g)\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bb\u2217\neV\n\n\u00132(1\u2212g)\n\n.\n\n(15)\n\nIn contrast to the leading order term, the dimensionless\ncorrection term fBS , which can be evaluated through an\nasymptotic expansion of Eq. (12), explicitly depends on\nthe length L of the wire, on the temperature T , and on\nthe position of the impurity x0 through the dimensionless\nparameters u = eV /~\u03c9L , \u0398 = kB T /~\u03c9L , and \u03be0 = x0 /L.\nWe find that\nosc\nfBS (u, \u0398, \u03be0 ) = fBS\n(u, \u0398, \u03be0 ) + . . . ,\n\n(16)\n\nosc\nwhere fBS\ndescribes the dominant oscillating correction.\nFor 0 < |\u03be0 | < 1/2 the asymptotic expansion yields\n\n2\n2\u0393(2g) X (1)\ncos [(1 \u2212 2s|\u03be0 |) u \u2212 \u03c0g(1 + s\u03b3/2)] (1 + 2s|\u03be0 |)2g\u03b3(1\u2212\u03b3\u2212\u03b3 /2)\nD (s|\u03be0 |; \u0398)\n\u0393(g\u03b3) s=\u00b1\nu2g(1\u2212\u03b3/2)\n(1 \u2212 2s|\u03be0 |)g(2\u2212\u03b3) (16|\u03be0 |)g\u03b3\n\n(17)\n\nwhose detailed expression is given in Eq. (C4).\n\nwith\n\u03b3=\n\n1\u2212g\n1+g\n\n(18)\n\nand D(1) (\u00b1|\u03be|; \u0398) is a numerical factor of order unity, explicitly given in Eq. (C1). We mention here that a similar\nasymptotic expansion has been worked out in Ref. [43],\nwhere the crossover from TLL to Fermi liquid behavior\nhas been studied for a tunnel barrier.\nNotice that Eq. (17) is singular for \u03be0 \u2192 0. This is actually only a mathematical problem: When the distances\nof the impurity from the two contacts become equal, pairs\nof poles in the correlation function merge. The full expression (12) for the current is however perfectly regular,\nosc\nand one can indeed still calculate fBS\nfor \u03be0 = 0 obtaining\n2\u0393(2g) (2)\ncos [u \u2212 \u03c0g(1 + \u03b3)]\nD (\u0398)\n,\n\u0393(g\u03b3)\nu2g(1\u2212\u03b3)\n(19)\nwhere D(2) (\u0398) is a numerical coefficient of order unity,\nosc\nfBS\n(u, \u0398, 0) =\n\nst\nIBS\n(V\n\n(13)\n\nst\nwhere IBS\nis the leading order term and fBS gives the\ncorrections. The former reads\nst\nIBS\n(V\n\nand is independent of the length L, of the temperature T ,\nand of the impurity position \u03be0 ; it exhibits a power law\nbehavior as a function of the applied voltage V , in accordance with the result for the homogeneous TLL.7 In\nEq. (14), \u03c9c is the high-energy cutoff. As usual, the\ncutoff dependence can be absorbed in an effective impurity strength \u03bb\u2217 = ~\u03c9c (\u03bb/~\u03c9c )1/(1\u2212g) , in terms of which\nEq. (14) reads\n\n(ii) In the regime ~\u03c9L \u226a {kB T, eV }, IBS can be well\napproximated by\nIBS\n\n\u0012 \u2217 \u00132(1\u2212g)\ne (2\u03c0)2g\n\u03bb\n\u2243\nkB T\nh 2\u0393(2g)\nkB T\neV\neV\n\u00d7 sinh(\n) |\u0393(g + i\n)|2 .\n2kB T\n2\u03c0kB T\n\n(20)\n\nHence, if ~\u03c9L is the smallest of all relevant energy scales,\nthe oscillatory dependence of IBS on V disappears, and\nthe current is independent of the length of the wire, and,\nin particular, of the impurity position. Indeed, in this\nregime the thermal decoherence time is much shorter\nthan the wire ballistic time; thus, the backscattering by\nthe impurity (occurring in the bulk of the wire) cannot be\ninfluenced by the physics at the contacts. The result (20)\ncoincides with the prediction for a homogeneous system\n(see e.g. Ref. [44]), provided that the voltage is rescaled\nV \u2192 gV .

(20)\nvanishes by virtue of the identity (B11). This is expected\nfor non-interacting electrons where IBS is a linear function of the applied voltage.\nWe conclude this section by discussing the behavior of\na dimensionless quantity that characterizes the current\nvoltage characteristics\n\u03baBS (V ) =\n\nV dIBS\n.\nIBS dV\n\n(21)\n\nIf the wire is assumed to be infinitely long, IBS is simply\ngiven by the right-hand side of Eq. (20); in this case, and\nin particular in the low temperatures regime kB T \u226a eV ,\n\u03baBS is actually independent of the voltage and equals\n2g \u2212 1, the power law exponent of IBS in the homogeneous TLL model.\nIn contrast, for a finite length wire, \u03baBS acquires a non\ntrivial voltage dependence, even at low temperatures. In\nparticular, if kB T . ~\u03c9L , \u03baBS (V ) exhibits an oscillating behavior around 2g \u2212 1, due to the Andreev-type\nreflections discussed previously. An average of \u03baBS (V )\nover a sufficiently large range of voltages thus allows for\nan estimate of g from the current-voltage characteristics.\nHigher temperatures kB T \u226b ~\u03c9L affect the coherence\nof the Andreev-type processes, and the amplitude of the\noscillations is suppressed. On the other hand, the amplitude of the oscillations also depends on the interaction\nstrength. For the case of a centered impurity, \u03baBS is depicted in Fig. 5, both for strong and weak interaction\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\neV / \u00d1\u03c9L\nFIG. 5:\nThe dimensionless quantity \u03baBS (V ) defined in\nEq.

Interestingly, with increasing voltage the amplitude of the oscillations of \u03baBS (V ) increases for strong\ninteraction, and decreases for \u221a\nweak interaction. There\nis a 'critical' value g = (1 + 17)/8 \u2243 0.64 at which\nthis change of behavior occurs. This can be determined\nanalytically from the asymptotic expansion (16)-(19) by\nrequiring that the exponent 2g(1 \u2212 \u03b3) of the power law\nin the denominator of Eq. (19) equals 1.\nFig. 6 refers to the case of an off-centered impurity; in\nthis case the behavior of \u03baBS (V ) is characterized by two\nunderlying frequencies \u03c9L1 and \u03c9L2 (\u03c9L1 < \u03c9L2 ), related\nto the times needed by a plasmon excitation to travel\nfrom the impurity to the contacts (see Eq. (17)). Thus,\nat low temperatures kB T \u226a {~\u03c9L1 , ~\u03c9L2 } the function\n\u03baBS (V ) exhibits two periods. Higher temperatures introduce again decoherence which suppresses the oscillations.\nHowever, in the temperature window ~\u03c9L1 . kB T .\n~\u03c9L2 , only coherence effects related to the Andreev-type\nreflections from the farther contact will be destroyed,\nwhereas the ones related to the closer contact are only\nweakly affected. Therefore \u03baBS (V ) will exhibit oscillations with one period only. In this regime, a graph of\n\u03baBS (V ) allows to determine: i) the value of g from the\naverage 2g \u2212 1, and ii) the position of the impurity from\nthe period \u2206V = \u03c0~vF /eg(L/2 \u2212 |x0 |) of the oscillations\nas a function of the voltage.\n\n\f8\n\n4\n\nHere, we just mention the final result. In the presence of\nan impurity, there is a contribution to the noise due to\nthe partitioning of the current at the backscatterer; as a\nconsequence, the noise can be written as\n\n2\n\nS(x, y, \u03c9) = S0 (x, y, \u03c9) + Simp (x, y, \u03c9) ,\n\n0\n\nwhere the first part, S0 (x, y, \u03c9), is the current noise in\nthe absence of a backscatterer which will be thoroughly\ndiscussed in the following subsection.

The three different curves refer to three different values\nof the dimensionless temperature \u0398 = kB T /~\u03c9L : \u0398 = 0.5\n(solid), \u0398 = 1 (dashed) and \u0398 = 3 (dotted). The two frequencies mentioned in the text are in this case \u03c9L1 /\u03c9L = 2/3\nand \u03c9L2 /\u03c9L = 2. For low temperatures the voltage dependence is affected by Andreev-type reflections at both contacts.\nFor higher temperatures interference effects only survive for\nAndreev-type reflections at the closer contact, so that only\nthe frequency \u03c9L2 is present. The average value of the oscillations is 2g \u2212 1 (horizontal solid line), whereas the period of\nthe oscillations \u2206V = 2\u03c0~\u03c9L /e(1 \u2212 2|\u03be0 |) reveals the position\nof the impurity.\n\nnamely a contribution SA (x, y, \u03c9) related to the Fourier\ntransform of the anticommutator of the backscattering\ncurrent operator jB , and a contribution SC (x, y, \u03c9) related to the time-retarded commutator of jB . Notice\nthat, in order to make the notation for S lighter, we have\nsuppressed the temperature T and voltage V arguments,\non which the noise depends in general.\nThe first term in Eq.

(8). The noise at finite frequency \u03c9, finite\ntemperature T , finite bias V , and finite length L will be\nanalyzed in the presence of a weak backscatterer in the\nQW. Mostly, this is done by numerical integration of a\ngeneral expression derived below. However, analytical\nresults are discussed for the case of thermal equilibrium\nand for the far from equilibrium shot noise limit, when\nthe applied voltage is much larger than all other relevant\nenergy scales.\nA detailed derivation of the full expression for the FF\nnoise in the presence of an impurity is given in App. D.\n\nSC (x, y, \u03c9) =\n\nfC (x0 , \u03c9) =\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndt ei\u03c9t h{\u2206jB (x0 , t), \u2206jB (x0 , 0)}i\u2192 ,\n\n(25)\nwhere \u2206jB (x0 , t) = jB (x0 , t) \u2212 hjB (x0 , t)i\u2192 . Here,\njB (x0 , t) is the backscattering current operator defined\nin Eq. (11), while \u03c30 (x, y; \u03c9) is the local conductivity of\nthe clean system discussed in the following subsection.\nSA (x, y, \u03c9) is the dominant contribution to the noise out\nof equilibrium, i.e. if eV \u226b {~\u03c9L , ~\u03c9, kB T }. At zero\ntemperature and frequency, SA (x, y, \u03c9) is even the only\nnon-vanishing part of the noise and commonly called shot\nnoise. The shot noise is independent of the position, as\nwill be demonstrated below.\nThe second part, SC (x, y, \u03c9), is given by Eq. (D15).\nUsing the results in Apps.

(22). S0 (x, y, \u03c9) is directly\nconnected to the Fourier transform of the anticommutator C \u03030K (x, y, \u03c9) of the bosonic phase field \u03a6(x, t) (see\nEq. (D13)). The properties of the correlation function\n(B4) at finite temperature allow to relate S0 also to the\nconductivity through the relation46\n\u0013\n\u0012\n~\u03c9\nR[\u03c30 (x, y, \u03c9)] , (28)\nS0 (x, y, \u03c9) = 2~\u03c9 coth\n2kB T\nwhere R denotes the real part. The latter equation is\nknown as the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT). For\nits derivation, we used that the conductivity can be expressed through the retarded correlation function by the\nKubo formula\n\u03c30 (x, y, \u03c9) =\n\n2e2\n\u03c9 C\u03030R (x, y, \u03c9) ,\nh\n\n(29)\n\nwhere C\u03030R (x, y, \u03c9) is given by Eq. (A17) in combination\nwith Eq. (B6). Eq. (28) holds for x = y in general, and\nalso for x 6= y if the unperturbed Hamiltonian preserves\ntime-reversal symmetry, as in our case. The relation (28)\nholds for any temperature T , noise frequency \u03c9, and system size L. This means that the information that can\nbe gained from the equilibrium noise is fully contained in\nthe AC conductivity. Notice that, by its definition (29),\nthe AC conductivity \u03c30 (x, y, \u03c9) is voltage independent.\nMoreover, it can easily be shown to be also temperature\nindependent. This is a direct consequence of the fact that\nthe model Hamiltonian H0 , Eq. (2), which describes an\ninteracting QW without impurity, is quadratic in the boson fields (see App. B for details). Thus, in the absence of\na backscatterer, the only temperature dependence of the\nnoise comes from the factor coth(~\u03c9/2kB T ) in Eq. (28).\n\nIn order to determine S0 , we are left with the analysis of\nthe x, \u03c9, and L dependence of the real part of the AC\nconductivity.\nAt very high frequencies, the FF noise becomes sensitive to its point of measurement47 , therefore, it is important to discuss for which range of measurement positions the results of our model will be reliable. As described in Sec. II, we model the electron reservoirs by\nnon-interacting one-dimensional QWs. This is legitimate\nas long as we are not more than an inelastic scatterR\nR\ning length lin\naway from the contacts. lin\nis the typical\nlength scale at which inter-channel scattering occurs in\nR\nthe reservoirs. Importantly, lin\nis not necessarily of the\nsame magnitude as the inelastic scattering length in the\nW\nwire lin\n, which, of course, has to be larger than L, in order to be in the ballistic regime. In some situations, for\ninstance, in cleaved edge overgrowth quantum wires, we\nR\nW\nexpect lin\n\u2248 lin\n, whereas in other situations we expect\nR\nW\nlin \u226a lin , for instance, in carbon nanotubes contacted\nby gold electrodes.\nOn the other hand, the model adopts a step-like profile at the contacts for the interaction strength g(x) (see\nFig. 1). Therefore, if dx is the distance between the\nmeasurement point (in the lead) and the closer contact,\ndx should not be smaller than the smoothing length Ls .\nHence, we can state that our model is reliable if the noise\nR\nis measured at a point x in the range Ls . dx . lin\n.\nFor simplicity, we will now concentrate on the local FF\nnoise, i.e. we will put x = y in Eq. (28). For a point x in\none of the leads it can be shown11 that\n\u03c30 (x, x, \u03c9) =\n\ne2\nh\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2i sin(\u03c9/\u03c9L )ei2\u03c9\u03b4x /g\u03c9L\n,\n1 + \u03b3 \u2212i\u03c9/\u03c9\nL \u2212 \u03b3 2 ei\u03c9/\u03c9L\ne\n(30)\n\nwhere\n\u03b4x = (|x| \u2212\n\nL\n1\n)/L = |\u03be| \u2212\n2\n2\n\nis the distance dx , in units of the wire length L.

As the point x gets closer to the\ncontact the beating period \u2206\u03c92 tends to infinity. The dashed\ncurve results from an averaging over the rapidly oscillating\ncomponent with period \u2206\u03c91 according to Eq. (38). The oscillation amplitude of the dashed curve is \u03b3, i.e. it allows to\ndetermine the interaction strength g from Eq. (18).\n\ntial dependence vanishes.

In\nthis regime Eq. (32) is oscillating as a function of \u03c9\nwith two characteristic periods \u2206\u03c91 and \u2206\u03c92 : the former, appearing through h1,2 , is related to the ballistic\nfrequency \u2206\u03c91 = \u03c0\u03c9L ; the latter depends on the measurement point and reads \u2206\u03c92 = \u03c0g\u03c9L /\u03b4x . Typically\none has \u2206\u03c91 \u226a \u2206\u03c92 , since \u03b4x \u226a 1; one therefore expects\n\n1\n=\n\u2206\u03c91\n\nZ\n\n\u2206\u03c91\n\nf (\u03c9/\u03c9L )d\u03c9.\n\n(39)\n\n0\n\nInterestingly, for any \u03b4x 6= 0, R[\u03c30slow (x, x, \u03c9)] in units\nof e2 /h oscillates around 1 with amplitude \u03b3 which is\ndirectly connected to the interaction strength g (see\nEq. (18)).\nFor the special case \u03b4x = 0 (i.e. if one could ideally\nmeasure the noise at the contacts), Eq. (32) becomes\nstrictly periodic in \u2206\u03c91 (the period \u2206\u03c92 \u2192 \u221e), and\nthe averaging procedure (39) directly yields\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u0013\u0015\nL L\ne2\ne2\nslow\nR \u03c30\n, ,\u03c9\n=\n(1 \u2212 \u03b3) =\ngc ,\n2 2\nh\nh\n\n(40)\n\nwhere gc = 2g/(1 + g) is the effective TLL interaction\nparameter at a point contact between a Fermi liquid\n(with interaction parameter g = 1) and a TLL (with\ninteraction parameter g).8,14\nThe frequency dependence of the noise S0 (x, x, \u03c9), related to R[\u03c30 ] through Eq. (28), is shown in Fig. 8 for\nthe measurement position \u03b4x = 0.05 (see Eq. (31)), and\nfor three different values of temperature \u0398 = kB T /~\u03c9L\n(\u0398 = 0, 2, 10). The noise is shown only for positive \u03c9\nsince S0 is symmetric in \u03c9 by definition. In Fig. 8a one\ncan see that at high frequencies \u03c9 \u226b \u03c9L the noise exhibits a linear growth modulated by oscillations with period \u2206\u03c91 = \u03c0\u03c9L . Fig. 8b is a blow-up of Fig. 8a at small\nfrequencies, showing for \u03c9 \u226a \u03c9L the Johnson-Nyquist\nnoise (36). Finally, Fig. 8c refers to low temperatures\n(\u0398 = 0, 0.05, 0.1) displaying at T = 0 and small frequencies the zero-point noise (37).\nIn the introduction, we have mentioned that in terms\nof comparison between theory and experiments, it is more\nsuitable to determine R[\u03c30 (x, x, \u03c9)] from a DC noise\nmeasurement (through the FDT relation (28)) than from\na direct AC conductivity measurement. Here, we have\nshown that by averaging R[\u03c30 (x, x, \u03c9)] over a frequency\nrange [0, \u03c0\u03c9L ] local features of the wire emerge, and the\nTLL parameter g becomes accessible. This statement\nwill be further supported by the results presented in\nSec. IV B.\n\n\f11\nBefore providing explicit results in the weak backscattering limit, we wish to emphasize two general aspects.\nFirst, in contrast to the clean case, in the presence of an\nimpurity the conductivity depends on temperature; as a\nconsequence, the temperature-dependence of the noise is\nno longer simply given by the coth factor in Eq.

(41) we observe that the noise is real, even for x 6= y; this is due to\nthe time-reversal symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the\nequilibrium condition.\nThe identity (41) can be verified using Eq.

The\nequilibrium noise can be obtained from the conductivity\nthrough Eq. (41). In particular, in the weak backscattering limit an expansion of the conductivity in powers of \u03bb\ngives to leading order\n\u03c3(x, y, \u03c9) = \u03c30 (x, y, \u03c9) + \u03c3BS (x, y, \u03c9)\n\n(45)\n\nwhere\n\u03c3BS (x, y, \u03c9) = \u2212\n\u00d7\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n2\n~\u03c9\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c0\u03bb\ne\n\n\u00132\n\ndt (ei\u03c9t \u2212 1)\n\n\u03c30 (x, x0 , \u03c9)\u03c30 (x0 , y, \u03c9)\n!\nX\n4\u03c0C0 (x0 ,st;x0 ,0)\nse\n.(46)\n\ns=\u00b1\n\nWe shall analyze here the local noise S(x, x, \u03c9) for a\npoint x located in the leads. Comparing Eqs. (41) and\n(22), one can easily recognize that the first term on the\nr.h.s. of Eq.

The frequency\nspectrum of Simp is shown in Fig. 9 for three different\nvalues of the dimensionless temperature \u0398 = kB T /~\u03c9L .\nThe upper graph of Fig. 9 shows that Simp oscillates\naround Simp = 0 with pronounced spikes of either sign,\nwhich are washed out when the temperature is increased.\nWhile Simp can be negative, the full noise (8) is nonnegative. The lower graph of Fig. 9 zooms into the region\nof low frequencies and illustrates that, at finite temperature, the value of Simp at \u03c9 = 0 is negative. This is in\naccordance with Eq. (42), since the presence of the impurity reduces the conductance G\u03bb with respect to the\nclean case.\nFig. 10 shows how the spikes of Simp depend on the\nposition of the impurity. Differently from the average\ncurrent shown in Fig. 2, the current fluctuations depend\nnot only on the absolute value of the impurity position,\nbut also on the direction of the shift from the center of\nthe wire. This is because in general the noise depends\non the measurement point x, which is located in one of\nthe leads, and therefore a shift of the impurity away from\nthe center implies a smaller or bigger distance from the\nmeasurement point x.\n\n-10\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n\u03c9/\u03c9L\nFIG. 11: The zero temperature impurity noise Simp at equilibrium (in units of e2 \u03c9L (\u03bb\u2217 /~\u03c9L )2(1\u2212g) ) as a function of\n\u03c9/\u03c9L , for the measurement position \u03b4x = 0.05, in the case\nof a centered impurity (\u03be0 = 0) and for three different values\nof the interaction strength: g = 0.25 (solid curve), g = 0.50\n(dashed curve), and g = 0.75 (dotted curve).\n\nThe spikes in the spectrum of Simp are essentially due\nto resonances caused by the Andreev-type reflections at\nthe contacts and backscattering at the impurity. A difference with respect to the clean case should be emphasized: In the clean case the peaks of the conductivity\n\u03c30 (x, x, \u03c9) are due to resonant processes where a cur-\n\n\f13\nrent pulse propagates from the measurement point x\nand comes back to x after a sequence of Andreev reflections at the contacts. In contrast, in the presence\nof the impurity, the conductivity \u03c3(x, x, \u03c9) also includes\nprocesses, where a current pulse from the measurement\npoint x propagates to the impurity position x0 , and then\nback from x0 to the measurement point x, whereby each\npath segment connecting x and x0 includes a sequence of\nAndreev-type reflections. These processes are described\nby \u03c3BS given in Eq. (46), which for x = y contains the\nproduct of \u03c30 (x, x0 , \u03c9) and \u03c30 (x0 , x, \u03c9). This product\nis weighted by a time integral over the exponential of\nthe Bose field correlation function at the impurity position, which in turn strongly depends on the interaction strength. As a consequence of this complicated interference of many different contributions, the analytical determination of the location of the peaks of Simp is\na complex problem, in which four elementary frequencies combine: \u03c9x = vF /(|x| \u2212 L/2), related to the distance of the measurement point from the closest contact,\n\u03c9L , the ballistic frequency of the finite length wire, and\n\u03c9\u00b1 = vF /g(1/2 \u00b1 \u03be0 ) related to the distances of the impurity from the two contacts. A straightforward analytic\nformula for the peak positions is thus in general not available, however, progress can be made in some limits. For\nstrong interaction (g . 0.4) and in the range of moderate to high frequencies (\u03c9 & 3\u03c9L ), the spectrum of Simp\nis essentially determined by I[\u03c302 (x, x0 , \u03c9)]. An analysis\nof this quantity shows that peaks occur at frequencies\n\u03c9 = n\u03c0\u03c9L (n integer) whenever there is an integer m\n\u22121\n(1/2 + m), where \u03a9 can\nsuch that 2n(\u03c9x\u22121 \u00b1 \u03a9\u22121 ) \u2243 \u03c9L\nbe either \u03c9L , \u03c9+ , \u03c9\u2212 or their sums and differences. The\npeaks are positive (negative) if m is even (odd). Thus,\none can realize that for some values of the impurity position, an upward spike due to a resonance with a frequency\n\u03a9 can be located close\nto a downward spike related to an\u2032\nother frequency \u03a9 , and therefore abrupt changes of the\n\nsign of Simp may occur, like in the solid curve of Fig. 10\nnear \u03c9 = 2\u03c0\u03c9L and \u03c9 = 8\u03c0\u03c9L .\nOn the other hand, for very weak interaction (g & 0.85)\nthe time-integral in Eq. (46) over the exponential of\nthe Bose field correlation function grows as a power law\n|\u03c9|2g\u22121 , and therefore plays an important role. At low\nfrequencies 0 < \u03c9/\u03c9L < 10 one finds that Simp is essentially proportional to |\u03c9|2g\u22121 (R[\u03c30 (x, x0 , \u03c9)])2 , which\nroughly amounts to Simp \u223c |\u03c9|2g\u22121 cos2 [\u03c9(\u03b4x /g \u2212 1/2 +\n\u03be0 )/\u03c9L ]. The frequency range in which this approximation is valid is however also interaction dependent. In\nparticular, the approximation becomes valid for all frequencies when the interaction is switched off (g \u2192 1).\nThe different forms of the frequency dependence of Simp\nfor various values of the interaction strength g are shown\nin Fig. 11, where the limiting cases discussed above can\nbe recognized.\nB.\n\nNon equilibrium noise\n\nUsually the FDT (28) is only valid in thermal equilibrium. However, in the absence of an impurity, the current\noperator of a QW attached to Fermi liquid leads is a linear superposition of contributions from normal plasmon\nmodes. Since the only mode depending on the voltage\n(i.e. the zero mode) is noiseless, one can in fact conclude\nthat S0 (x, x, \u03c9) does not depend on the applied voltage V\nand is just given by Eq. (28), also out of equilibrium. In\ncontrast, the impurity noise Simp (x, x, \u03c9) is voltage dependent. Again we concentrate on the weak backscattering limit which amounts to performing a perturbative\nexpansion in \u03bb, up to order \u03bb2 . In doing so the average\nvalue h. . .i\u2192 can actually be replaced by the free average\nh. . .i0 .

However, the r.h.s. of Eq. (47) depends on the\nposition of the impurity x0 . With the help of Eq. (49)\none sees that Eq. (47) has a form similar to Eq. (12), the\nbackscattering current at the impurity.\nWe discuss now the non-equilibrium properties of the\nspectrum Simp (x, x, \u03c9) of the impurity noise, considering\nfor simplicity the case of a centered impurity at \u03be0 = 0.\nWe first analyze the case of zero temperature, where a\nnon-analyticity at the frequency \u03c90 = eV /~ arises. In\nFig. 12, one can see the discontinuity of the derivative\nof Simp with respect to the frequency. This singularity\nstems from the contribution SA to the impurity noise\nSimp , as shown in Fig. 13a. Thus, in regimes where SA is\ndominated by SC , the singularity is hardly visible: this\nis the case when the interaction is strong and when \u03c9 \u223c\n\nFIG. 13: a) The frequency spectra of the two contributions\nSA (dashed curve) and SC (dotted curve) to the impurity\nnoise Simp = SA + SC (solid curve) show that the presence of\nthe cusp is due to SA . The value of the dimensionless voltage\nis u = 2, and the other parameters are chosen as in Fig. 12.\nb) The contribution SA for four different values of the interaction strength: g = 0.25 (solid curve), g = 0.50 (dashed curve),\ng = 0.75 (dotted curve), and g = 0.95 (dash-dotted curve).\nThe interaction modifies the slope to the right and to the left\nof the singularity at \u03c9 = eV /~.\n\n\u03c90 \u226b \u03c9L , as for the dotted curve in Fig. 12.\nThis non-analyticity of the noise at \u03c9 = \u00b1\u03c90 is already present in a non-interacting wire where it arises\nfrom the sharpness of the Fermi surface at T = 0.50 This\nis recovered in our model by taking the limit g \u2192 1. In\nthis limit, SA turns out to describe current fluctuations\ndue to electrons originating from different reservoirs (the\nleft and the right one), whereas SC comes from current\nfluctuations due to electrons originating from the same\nreservoir (see e.g. Ref. [23]). When electron-electron interaction is taken into account (g < 1), the slope of the\nbranches of SA below and above the singularity is modified. While for a non-interacting system SA is frequencyindependent for \u03c9 . \u03c90 and proportional to \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90 for\n\u03c9 & \u03c90 , in the interacting case, one finds interaction dependent slopes, clearly shown in Fig. 13b. Thus, the type\nof singularity at \u03c9 = \u00b1\u03c90 turns out to be essentially unchanged by the interaction, in particular, the location of\nthe cusp is not modified. We emphasize that this prediction is different from the results for the homogeneous\nTLL, where the linear dependence \u221d |\u03c9 \u00b1 \u03c90 | is turned\ninto a g-dependent power-law |\u03c9 \u00b1 \u03c90 |2g\u22121 .24,48 Hence,\nthis power-law is masked by the presence of the leads.\nIn the case of finite temperature, the cusp at \u03c9 = eV /~\nis smeared like in a non-interacting wire, i.e. through a\n\n\f15\ncoth[~(\u03c9 \u00b1 \u03c90 )/kB T ] prefactor (see Eq. (49)).\n1.\n\nWe first describe the case of a centered impurity, i.e.\n\u03be0 = x0 /L = 0; in this case the Fano factor reads\n\nShot noise regime\n\nF (\u03c9) =\n\nThe ideal shot noise is defined as the value of the noise\nat zero temperature and zero frequency. In this limit,\nthe ratio of the current noise and the backscattering current is related to the charge that is transferred in each\nbackscattering event.23 For the system under consideration, it has already been shown26,27 that the shot noise\nis independent of x and can be written as\nS(x, x, 0) = 2eIBS ,\n\n(53)\n\nwhere the backscattering current IBS is given by Eq. (10).\nThis result can be easily seen from the expressions for\nthe current and noise at order \u03bb2 derived above. For\nT = 0 and \u03c9 = 0 the terms in Eqs. (12) and (49) with\n's = \u22121' vanish and SA (x, x, 0) is the only contribution to\nthe noise (S0 and SC vanish for T = 0 and \u03c9 = 0). This\nis why S(x, x, 0) and IBS are related to each other by the\nsimple relation (53). Hence, if \u03c9 \u226a \u03c9L , the fractional\ncharge of the charge excitations that are backscattered\nat an impurity in a TLL51,52 does not become visible\nthrough the Fano factor F = S/2eIBS . Instead, Eq. (53)\njust reveals the electron charge e.\nSince this is a consequence of the fact that at very\nlow frequencies one probes the charge dynamics at long\nlength scales, larger than the wire length L, it should\nbe interesting to look at frequencies near \u03c9L , where the\ncurrent noise is expected to become sensitive to internal\nbackscattering processes in the wire. In particular, it will\nbe shown below that a voltage and temperature regime\nexists in which the frequency behavior of the noise is\ngiven by\nS(x, x, \u03c9) \u2243 2eF (\u03c9)IBS .\n\n(54)\n\nHere the function F (\u03c9), which plays the role of an effective Fano factor, reads\nF (\u03c9) =\n\nh2\n2\n|\u03c30 (x, x0 , \u03c9)| ,\ne4\n\n(55)\n\nwhere \u03c30 (x, x0 , \u03c9) is given by Eq. (52). Before discussing\nin detail the parameter regime in which the noise acquires\nthe simple form (54), we want to comment on the physical\ncontents of this relation.\nAs shown in Ref. [31], the effective Fano factor F (\u03c9)\nallows to determine the fractional charge of the quasiparticles of the interacting wire. Importantly, Eq. (55) does\nnot depend on temperature since the conductivity of the\nclean wire is temperature independent. An explicit expression for F (\u03c9) is obtained by inserting Eq. (52) into\nEq. (55). In doing so, one can realize that F is actually\nalso independent of the point of measurement x, but it\ndepends on the impurity position x0 .\n\n2g 2\n,\n1 + g 2 \u2212 (1 \u2212 g 2 ) cos(\u03c9/\u03c9L )\n\n(56)\n\nand its behavior as a function of \u03c9 is shown in Fig. 14.\nThe choice of a centered impurity also allows us to compare the noise of the finite length wire with the noise\nobtained within the homogeneous TLL model. The latter model corresponds, in a sense, to the limit L \u2192 \u221e\nof our model with a fixed impurity position x0 , hence,\n\u03be0 = x0 /L \u2192 0.\nLet us discuss several limits of Eq. (54). Since F (0) =\n1, in the limit \u03c9 \u2192 0, Eq. (54) yields the interactionindependent result (53). Evidently, one has to go to finite\nfrequency to obtain more interesting results. If we again\nadopt the averaging procedure (39), and note that the\naverage value of F (\u03c9) is the interaction parameter g (see\nFig. 14), we obtain53\nhS(x, x, \u03c9)i\u2206\u03c91 \u2243 2egIBS .\n\n(57)\n\nSeemingly, Eq. (57) suggests that quasiparticles with a\nfractional charge e\u2217 = eg are backscattered off the impurity in the TLL. For L \u2192 \u221e the Fano factor (56) becomes\na rapidly oscillating function, and the frequency interval\n\u2206\u03c91 over which F (\u03c9) is averaged in Eq. (57) vanishes.\nThis result should therefore describe the noise of the homogeneous TLL model with an impurity28 as it is indeed\nthe case. Hence, our findings are in accordance with previous considerations of the effects of an impurity in a\nTLL.51,52\nWe now discuss in detail the conditions under which\nthe simple expression (54) holds. In particular, we consider the parameter regime eV \u226b {kB T, ~\u03c9, ~\u03c9L } (which\nwill be referred henceforth as the shot noise regime). We\nwrite the noise as\nS(x, x, \u03c9) = 2eF (\u03c9) IBS [\u2206A + \u2206C + \u22060 ]\n\n(58)\n\nwith the functions \u2206\u03b1 = S\u03b1 /2eF (\u03c9)IBS , where the subscript \u03b1 takes the values \u03b1 = A, C, 0, and the S\u03b1 are\nrespectively given by Eqs. (28), (47), and (48). Using\nthese formulas, one can then evaluate \u2206A , \u2206C , and \u22060\nin the shot noise regime. The range of validity of Eq. (54)\ncorresponds to a parameter regime in which \u2206A \u2243 1,\n|\u2206C |, |\u22060 | \u226a 1. The main contribution to the shot noise\nthus stems from SA .\nIndeed, in the shot noise regime SA can easily be shown\nto read\nSA (x, x, \u03c9) = e F (\u03c9) [IBS (eV + ~\u03c9) + IBS (eV \u2212 ~\u03c9)]\n\u001a\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\u001b\nkB T\n\u00d7 1 + O exp\n(59)\neV \u00b1 ~\u03c9\nwhich gives\n\u2206A \u2243\n\nIBS (eV + ~\u03c9) + IBS (eV \u2212 ~\u03c9)\n,\n2IBS (eV )\n\n(60)\n\n\f16\n1.010\n\n1.0\n\n2\u03c0\n\na)\n\n1.005\n\n\u2206A\n\n0.8\n\n1.000\n\ng\n\n0.995\n\nF\n\n0.6\n0.990\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nb)\n\n1.4\n\n\u2206A\n\n0.2\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n\u03c9/\u03c9L\n\n0.4\n\n1.3\n1.2\n\n1.1\n\n0.0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n\u03c9/\u03c9L\nFIG. 14: The periodic function F (\u03c9) defined in Eq. (56)\nis plotted for g = 0.75 against \u03c9/\u03c9L . While F (0) = 1, the\naverage over one period yields the interaction parameter g.\n\nwhere the omitted terms are exponentially small corrections. Eq. (60) reveals that \u2206A can be directly extracted\nfrom the current voltage characteristics. As shown in\nFig. 15 for the case of eV = 100~\u03c9L , in order to make the\ndeviations from \u2206A = 1 negligible, one has to operate at\na sufficiently high temperature, so that the oscillations of\nthe current are damped. For weak interactions (g \u2243 0.75)\na temperature of the order of kB T \u2243 ~\u03c9L or even smaller\nis already sufficient to fulfill this requirement, whereas for\nstrong interaction (g \u2243 0.25) higher temperatures of the\norder of kB T \u2243 2 \u2212 3~\u03c9L are necessary.\nWe now turn to the correction \u2206C . In the low frequencies range (\u03c9 . \u03c9L ), \u2206C can be written as\n\u0013\"\n\u0012 \u00132 #\n\u0012\n2~\u03c9\n\u03c9\n~\u03c9\n|\u2206C | =\n|\u03baBS (V )| + O\n,\ncoth\neV\n2kB T\n\u03c9L\n(61)\nwhere the quantity \u03baBS (V ) is defined in Eq. (21). Here,\none can again distinguish two cases. For weak interaction, \u03baBS (V ) is a slowly decreasing function of voltage, of\nthe order of 2g \u2212 1 (see Fig. 5b). Therefore |\u2206C | \u226a 1 requires eV \u226b max{kB T, ~\u03c9, ~\u03c9L}. In contrast, for strong\ninteraction \u03baBS (V ) exhibits large oscillations increasing\nwith voltage (see Fig. 5a), which might yield very large\nvalues of \u2206C . To recover the simple behavior (54), it is\ntherefore crucial to exploit these oscillations by choosing voltage values at which \u03baBS (V ) \u2248 0. Thus, with\na suitable choice of temperature and voltage, the condition |\u2206C | \u226a 1 can always be fulfilled in the low frequency\nrange. When this is the case, it turns out from the numerical analysis that the condition |\u2206C | \u226a 1 then remains\nvalid up to frequencies \u03c9 \u223c 10 \u03c9L .\nFinally, to obtain an estimate of \u22060 , we observe that\nthe backscattering current can be written as IBS =\n(e2 /h)RV , where R \u226a 1 is an effective reflection coefficient that can be directly extracted from a currentvoltage measurement.

The value of the dimensionless voltage is u = eV /~\u03c9L = 100, and the impurity is located in\nthe middle \u03be0 = 0. Differences between the exact value of\n\u2206A and its approximation (60) are not visible. a) refers to\nthe case of weak interaction g = 0.75 and b) to the case of\nstrong interaction g = 0.25. The three different curves in each\nplot correspond to three different values of the dimensionless\ntemperatures \u0398 = kB T /~\u03c9L , \u0398 = 0 (solid), \u0398 = 1 (dashed),\nand \u0398 = 2 (dotted). Notice the different scales in the two\ncases: For weak interaction even small temperatures allow to\nfulfill the requirement \u2206A \u2243 1, whereas for strong interaction\na temperature of the order of \u0398 \u2243 2 \u2212 3 is required.\n\nwire, R now depends in general on voltage, interaction\nstrength, and temperature. Since the (temperature independent) function (h/e2 )R[\u03c30 (x, x, \u03c9)]/F (\u03c9) has a maximum C, we obtain for \u22060 the upper bound\n\u0012\n\u0013\n~\u03c9\n~\u03c9\n|\u22060 | \u2264 coth\nC.\n(62)\n2kB T eV R\nThe value of C depends on the interaction strength. For\nrelatively weak interaction (g \u2243 0.75) one has C \u2243 1,\nwhereas for strong interaction (g \u2243 0.25) C \u2243 4. Thus,\nthe condition |\u22060 | \u226a 1 is certainly fulfilled in the parameter range eV R \u226b C max{kB T, ~\u03c9, ~\u03c9L }.\nIn summarizing these considerations, we see that a\nnoise measurement in the parameter regime eV R \u226b C~\u03c9\nallows to extract the Fano factor F (\u03c9) from noise data.\nThe optimal temperature at which one should operate\ndepends on the QW under investigation. In particular,\nfor systems characterized by weak or moderate interaction (g \u2243 0.75), like for most semiconductor QWs, the\noptimal temperature is kB T /~\u03c9L . 1, while for strong\ninteraction (g \u2243 0.25), like for SWNTs, a temperature\nkB T /~\u03c9L \u2243 2 \u2212 3 is more appropriate.

The\ndashed curve is obtained after a background subtraction (see\ntext).\n\nlem can be at least partially overcome by an appropriate\nbackground subtraction. This is demonstrated in Fig. 16\nfor the cases of weak and strong interaction, respectively.\nFig. 16a refers to a weakly interacting QW with interaction parameter g = 0.75. The temperature kB T = ~\u03c9L\nand the voltage eV = 100~\u03c9L. The impurity is assumed\nto be in the middle, i.e., \u03be0 = 0, and the measurement\npoint is near a contact so that \u03b4x = 0.05. The impurity leads to an effective reflection coefficient R = 0.2\nwhich correspond to an effective impurity strength \u03bb\u2217 \u223c\n10\u22124 eV . For these parameters the full noise has still a\nsizable contribution from S0 , as can be estimated from\nEq. (62), which gives for frequencies \u03c9 \u223c \u03c0\u03c9L and the\nabove parameters \u22060 \u223c 0.2. A simplified estimate for S0\nreads\nSoff\u2212set =\n\ne2\n\u03c9 coth(~\u03c9/2kB T ) ,\n\u03c0\n\n(63)\n\nwhich can be subtracted from the full noise to give the\ndashed curve in Fig. 16a. When this curve is averaged\nbetween \u03c9 = 0 and the first maximum, one extracts g \u223c\n0.71, which is a reasonable estimate of 0.75.\nFig. 16b refers to a strongly interacting QW with interaction parameter g = 0.25. Here, the temperature\nkB T = 2~\u03c9L and the voltage eV = 98.83~\u03c9L, a value\nchosen with the help of the current voltage characteristic\nin such a way that \u03baBS = 0. This makes the contribution\nof SC negligible, as discussed above, cf. Eq. (61). The impurity is again assumed to be in the middle, i.e., \u03be0 = 0,\nand the measurement point corresponds to \u03b4x = 0.05.\nThe effective reflection coefficient R = 0.2 now comes\n\nfrom an impurity with effective strength \u03bb\u2217 \u223c 0.12eV .\nFor these parameters the full noise has a large contribution from S0 , since Eq. (62) gives \u22060 \u223c 0.6 for frequencies\n\u03c9 \u223c \u03c0\u03c9L . Despite this large value of \u22060 , the value of g\ncan still be extracted. A subtraction of Soff\u2212set leads to\nthe dashed curve in Fig. 16b. When this curve is averaged between \u03c9 = 0 and the second maximum, where the\nnoise reaches again the same level as at low frequencies,\none obtains g \u223c 0.23, again a reasonable estimate of 0.25.\nA more accurate data analysis can, of course, be based\non the full expressions for the noise derived above.\nWe mention that a similar procedure can be provided\nfor the case of an off-centered impurity. For an arbitrary\nimpurity position x0 , the Fano factor reads\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1 + \u03b3 2 + 2\u03b3 cos 2\u03c9(\u03be\u03c90 +1/2)\nL\n\u0010 \u0011\n, (64)\nF (\u03c9) = (1 \u2212 \u03b3)2\n2\u03c9\n4\n2\n1 + \u03b3 \u2212 2\u03b3 cos \u03c9L\n\nwhere again \u03be0 = x0 /L. When compared to the case of a\ncentered impurity, we observe that now for certain noise\nfrequencies a pronounced reduction of the Fano factor\noccurs, as discussed in Ref. [31]. This effect could be\nrelated to the low Fano factor measured in bundles of\ncarbon nanotubes.35 Secondly, since Eq. (64) is not in\ngeneral a periodic function, the averaging procedure used\nin Eq. (57) to derive g cannot be applied. However, one\ncan always introduce the function\n1\nF i(\u03a9) =\n\u03a9\n\nZ\n\n\u03a9\n\nF (\u03c9) d\u03c9 ,\n\n(65)\n\n0\n\nwhich is a generalization of the averaging defined in\nEq. (39).\nInterestingly, F i(\u03a9) exhibits oscillations\naround the value g for any position \u03be0 of the impurity;\nthese oscillations are damped with increasing \u03a9, and the\nvalue of g can be extracted, or at least relatively well\nestimated.\nDespite the progress made recently with the measurement of high frequency noise,33,54 it might be difficult\nto obtain accurate noise data up to frequencies of order\n10\u03c9L , if the QW is not very long. Then, a more detailed\nanalysis of low frequency noise data may be of particular\ninterest. As we have shown previously31 , the interaction\nconstant g could also be deduced from the low-frequency\nbehavior of the Fano factor (64)\n\u0012\n\n\u03c9L\nF (\u03c9) = 1\u2212\n2vF\n\n\u00132\n\u0012 \u00134\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03c9\n2\n2\n(1\u2212g ) 1 + 4g \u03be0 (1 + \u03be0 ) +O\n\u03c9L\n\nonce the position of the impurity is known. The latter\ncan be determined from the current voltage characteristics by tuning the temperature, as described in Sec. III.\nWe conclude this discussion of the shot noise by\nmentioning another interesting feature emerging in this\nregime, namely the fact that the slope of the noise at\n\n\f18\n\u03c9 = 0 is related to the differential conductance. Explicitly, we obtain\n\u00132\n\u0012\nS(x, x, \u03c9) \u2212 S(x, x, 0)\nh dI\nlim\n.\n(66)\n=\n\u03c9\u21920\n2~\u03c9(e2 /h)\ne2 dV\nThis result has been derived perturbatively in the impurity strength including terms up to order \u03bb2 and is in\nagreement with the Coulomb gas calculation for the homogeneous TLL model.48 Moreover, in the limit g \u2192 1,\nEq. (66) coincides with the corresponding expression\nfor non-interacting electrons.23 We note that the limits\nV \u2192 0 and \u03c9 \u2192 0 are not interchangeable, since from\nEq. (41) the slope of the noise at equilibrium (V = 0)\nis proportional to the linear conductance, and not to its\nsquare. The simple relation Eq. (66) between the slope of\nthe noise and the dimensionless differential conductance\nis only valid at zero temperature; in addition, an exact solution of the homogeneous TLL model49 indicates\nthat such a simple relation may not hold if all orders in\nthe impurity strength are taken into account in a nonperturbative way.\nC.\n\nExcess noise\n\nIn the previous subsections we have discussed the equilibrium noise and the non-equilibrium noise. In the\npresent section we focus on the excess noise, which is\nsimply defined as their difference\nSE (x, x, \u03c9) = S(x, x, \u03c9) \u2212 S(x, x, \u03c9)|V =0 .\n\n(67)\n\nSince the S0 contribution to the noise does not depend\non the voltage, SE is independent of S0 and therefore a\nquantity arising entirely from the presence of the impurity. For this reason, the excess noise is of particular interest. The impurity strength appears in SE as an overall\nscaling factor. In contrast, in the full noise the presence\nof S0 , which is independent of the impurity strength, requires a background subtraction to reveal the interesting\neffects related to impurity backscattering. We notice that\nSE can also be written as\n\nis dominated by the equilibrium noise, in particular,\nby the supplementary noise Simp at equilibrium, i.e.,\nSE \u2243 \u2212Simp |V =0 . Deviations from this behavior lead\nto the spots along the diagonal of the excess noise diagram. These spots appear whenever eV /~ equals a frequency corresponding to a peak of the equilibrium noise.\nThen, the excess noise acquires a non negligible contribution also from the finite voltage term, and the simple\nformula SE \u2243 \u2212Simp|V =0 is not valid. As discussed in\nSec. IV A 2, these particular frequency values are determined by I[\u03c302 (x, x0 , \u03c9)].\nLet us now consider the case of weaker interaction\nstrength. The evolution of the excess noise in Fig. 17\nfrom a) to d) shows that the scenario dramatically\nchanges, even at the qualitative level: The horizontal\nlines smear out and a diagonally oriented shape arises.\nA very sharp diagonal structure is precisely the expected\nbehavior of the excess noise in the noninteracting limit,\nwhere SE is given by23\n\uf8f1\n0\n~|\u03c9| > eV\n2 \uf8f2\ne\nSE =\n(69)\nh \uf8f3 2(eV \u2212 ~|\u03c9|)R(1 \u2212 R) ~|\u03c9| < eV,\n\nwhere R is the reflection coefficient. Still, some qualitative differences compared to the noninteracting case\nare present. While for the non-interacting system the\nexcess noise is always strictly non-negative, regions of\nnegative excess noise emerge for the interacting case.\nThe fact that the excess noise SE can be negative may\nbe surprising, since the presence of an applied voltage\nis expected to increase the noise. However, we deal\nhere with a non-linear system, where the voltage also\naffects the interference conditions between plasmonic\ncharge excitations that are Andreev-type reflected at\nthe contacts and backscattered by the impurity. Thus,\ndepending on V , the interference can be destructive or\nconstructive, and \u2013 under certain circumstances \u2013 the\nequilibrium noise can be larger than the corresponding\nnon-equilibrium noise at the same noise frequency \u03c9.\n\nV.\n\nSE (x, x, \u03c9) = Simp (x, x, \u03c9) \u2212 Simp (x, x, \u03c9)|V =0\nwith\nSimp (x, x, \u03c9)|V =0 = 2~\u03c9 coth\n\n\u0012\n\n~\u03c9\n2kB T\n\n\u0013\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n(68)\n\nR[\u03c3BS (x, x, \u03c9)],\n\nwhere \u03c3BS (x, y, \u03c9) is given in Eq. (46).\nThe behavior of the excess noise is illustrated in\nFig. 17. We first focus on Fig. 17a, which refers to the\ncase of strong electron interaction (g = 0.25). Then,\napart from some special points along the diagonal, the\nstructure of the excess noise essentially exhibits a voltage independent behavior, as the horizontally oriented\nshape suggests. Indeed, for strong interaction and for\nmoderate to high frequencies (\u03c9 & \u03c9L ), the excess noise\n\nIn the present work, we have investigated transport\nproperties of interacting quantum wires with a weak impurity coupled to non-interacting (Fermi liquid) electron\nreservoirs. We have used the inhomogeneous Tomonaga\nLuttinger liquid model with a backscattering term to describe the system, and the Keldysh formalism to predict\nits transport properties out of equilibrium. It has been\nshown that the finite length L of the quantum wire crucially affects the transport properties.\nOn the one hand, the nonlinear I \u2212 V characteristics\nbecomes an oscillating function of the applied voltage, an\neffect which is washed out if the temperature is raised.\nIt has also been shown that, with an appropriate choice\nof the temperature, these oscillations can be exploited\n\n\f19\n\nFIG. 17: The excess noise at zero temperature and for an impurity in the middle of the wire (\u03be0 = 0) is shown (in units\nof e2 \u03c9L (\u03bb\u2217 /~\u03c9L )2(1\u2212g) ) as a function of the dimensionless frequency \u03c9/\u03c9L and the applied voltage eV /~\u03c9L for four values of\ninteraction strength: a) g = 0.25; b) g = 0.5; c) g = 0.75; d) g = 0.95.\n\nto measure both the interaction strength g and the position of an impurity in the wire. We wish to emphasize that these oscillations are not due to nonadiabatic\ncontacts, which would lead to ordinary Fabry-P\u00e9rot oscillations that are also present in a noninteracting wire.\nInstead, the oscillations predicted here arise because of a\nmismatch of the strength of the electron-electron interaction in the quantum wire and the leads. Therefore, a\nmeasurement of these current oscillations would provide\nevidence for electronic correlations in one-dimensional\nsystems. From the above remarks it is clear that one\nneeds a way to distinguish experimentally the current\noscillations due to a mismatch of the electron-electron\ninteraction from ordinary Fabry-P\u00e9rot oscillations. We\npropose to vary the voltage of a metallic back-gate that\ninfluences the electron density in the quantum wire, since\nthe ordinary Fabry-P\u00e9rot oscillations are highly affected\n\nby a change of the gate voltage.40,55 In contrast, this\nis not necessarily the case for the oscillations predicted\nhere. More precisely, if the distance between the onedimensional channel and the gate electrode does not depend on the gate voltage, the interaction parameter g\nis essentially independent of the applied gate voltage,\nand the oscillations predicted here should not be affected\nmuch by a change of the gate voltage. This will typically\nbe the case for a SWNT on an oxidized substrate. In\nsemiconductor QWs a weak dependence of g on the gate\nvoltage has to be expected. However, the gate voltage\ndependence seems to be a decisive factor distinguishing\nFabry-P\u00e9rot oscillations from the oscillations predicted\nby us.\nOn the other hand, we have shown that, similarly\nto the average current, also the frequency spectrum of\nthe current noise significantly depends on the interaction\n\n\f20\nstrength and the finite length of the wire. At frequencies\n\u03c9 \u226a \u03c9L = vF /gL, the noise is determined by slow processes, much slower than the traversal time of a plasmon\nthrough the interacting wire, and the noise is not affected\nby the presence of electron-electron interaction. This is\nsimilar to the absence of a suppression of the DC conductance by the interaction in a one-dimensional quantum wire connected to Fermi liquid leads. In the limit\n\u03c9 \u2192 0, internal properties of the interacting wire cannot\nbe resolved, and the wire with the impurity effectively\nbehaves as a complicated scatterer between two Fermi\nliquid leads. However, for noise frequencies of the order\nof \u03c9L , the situation changes both for the equilibrium and\nthe non-equilibrium case.\nIn particular the equilibrium noise, related to the AC\nconductivity by the FDT, has been shown to exhibit oscillations as a function of \u03c9 already in the absence of\nimpurities in the wire. These oscillations are characterized by two frequencies, where the larger one is proportional to the ballistic frequency related to the length of\nthe wire, while the smaller one depends on the distance\nof the measurement point of the noise from the nearby\ncontact. An average over the fast oscillations allows to\nobtain a sinusoidal spectrum whose amplitude is directly\nconnected to the interaction strength. In the presence of\nan impurity there is a supplementary equilibrium noise\nSimp . For a strongly interacting QW, Simp is characterized by sharp spikes due to resonance phenomena caused\nby the Andreev-type reflections at the contacts and the\nbackscattering at the impurity.\nIn presence of an applied voltage, we have seen that\nthe zero temperature noise spectrum has cusps at the\nfrequencies \u03c9 = \u00b1eV /~, as it is already the case for a\nnoninteracting wire. We have shown that the electronic\ncorrelations affect the value of the slopes on both sides\nof these singularities in a different way. In contrast to\npredictions based on the homogeneous TLL model, the\ntype of singularity is however not changed.\nWe have then focussed on the shot noise regime (eV \u226b\n{kB T, ~\u03c9, ~\u03c9L }), where the system is strongly out of\nequilibrium. In this case, the scattering processes at the\nimpurity are known to obey Poissonian statistics, and\nthe noise is proportional to the backscattering current.\nThe value of the Fano factor (ratio between S and IBS )\nstrongly depends on the frequency range one explores. If\n\u03c9 is of the order of the ballistic frequency \u03c9L or larger, the\nFano factor depends on g. This dependence becomes particularly simple if the impurity is located in the middle\nof the wire. In that case, e\u2217 = eg appears as a prefactor\nof the finite frequency noise, when it is averaged over an\nappropriate frequency range. This may allow for an independent way to measure g. The most promising range\nof parameters for such an experiment as well as possible improvements of the data analysis by a background\nsubtractions have been thoroughly discussed. Moreover,\nit has been shown that relevant information is already\ncontained in the low frequency noise data.\nWe also mention that in realistic one-dimensional sys-\n\ntems, like SWNTs or cleaved edge overgrowth QWs, typical values of the Fermi velocity are vF \u223c 105 \u00f7 106 m/s.\nThe length of the wires can vary from 1\u03bcm up to tenths of\n\u03bcm, whereas the typical interaction strengths are g \u223c 0.2\nfor SWNTs and g \u223c 0.7 for semiconductor QWs. These\nvalues yield estimates of the ballistic frequency ~\u03c9L of\norder meV or below.56,57 The conditions eV \u226b ~\u03c9L and\n\u03c9 \u226b \u03c9L for the observability of the current oscillations\nand the fractional charge are therefore experimentally realistic according to nowadays techniques.33,34 Moreover,\nthe constraints for experiments in the shot noise regime\ncould be significantly relaxed, provided that the experimental setup enables a measurement of the supplementary noise Simp = SA + SC instead of the full noise S\nonly. Then, the condition \u22060 \u226a 1 is redundant, and one\nis left with the weaker conditions \u2206A \u2243 1 and \u2206C \u226a 1,\nwhich amount to require eV \u226b ~\u03c9, and kB T /~\u03c9L . 1\n(kB T /~\u03c9L \u223c 2 \u2212 3) for weak (strong) interaction.

Accordingly, we split the average value ap-\n\npearing in (B5) as h. . .i = h. . .iGS + h: . . . :i, where the\nsymbols h. . .iGS and : : respectively indicate the average\nover the ground state of (2), and Boson normal ordering.\nThus, we have\nC0 = C0;GS + C0;TF .\n\n(B7)\n\nAs one can see from Eq.
