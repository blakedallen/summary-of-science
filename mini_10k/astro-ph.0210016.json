We are carrying out a program of high signal to noise optical spectroscopy of BL Lacs with unknown or tentative redshift. Here\nwe report some preliminary results. New redshifts are measured for\nPKS0754+100 (z=0.266) and 1ES0715-259 (z=0.464). From lineless spectra of PG1553+113 and PKS1722+119 we set a lower limit of z>0.3 for\nboth sources. In two cases (UM493 and 1620+103) stellar spectra indicate\na wrong classification.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction and Observations\n\nAt variance with other classes of AGN BL Lac Objects are characterized by\nquasi featureless optical spectra. This often hinders the determination of the\nredshift (and therefore of the distance) of these sources. In the V\u00e9ron C\u00e9tty\nand V\u00e9ron catalog (2001) of AGN there are \u223c600 objects classified as BL Lacs\nand only for half of them the redshift is known. In order to contribute to the\nmeasurement of this fundamental parameter we are carrying out a systematic\nstudy of the optical spectra of objects with unknown or tentative redshift. We\npresent here preliminary results from two campaigns at the European Southern\nObservatory (ESO) telescope performed in 2001 July and 2002 January.\nThe observations were gathered using the 3.6m telescope equipped with\nEFOSC2. Standard data reduction was performed using different packages in\nIRAF in order to obtain 1-dimensional wavelength and flux calibrated extracted\nspectra.\n2.\n2.1.\n\nResults\nNew redshifts\n\nPKS 0754+100 is a highly polarized and variable source that was discovered\nby Tapia et al. (1977) and classified as a blazar by Angel & Stockman (1980).\nA first tentative redshift proposed by Persic and Salucci (1986, z=0.66) was put\nin doubt after the detection of the host galaxy by Abraham et al. (1991) and by\n1\n\n\f2\n\nCarangelo et al.\n\nFalomo (1996), because at this redshift the host would be extremely luminous\n(MR \u2243-25).\nOur spectrum (see fig. 1) shows clearly two emission lines at \u03bb=4717.2\n\u00c5 (EW=0.9 \u00c5) and \u03bb=6340.4 \u00c5(EW=1.3 \u00c5). Identification of these features\nwith [OII](3727 \u00c5) and [OIII] (5007 \u00c5) yields a redshift z=0.266\u00b10.001. This\nis consistent with the tentative redshift proposed by Falomo and Ulrich (2000,\nz\u22430.28). At z=0.266 the host galaxy luminosity becomes MR =-22.9. We note\nthat at the same redshift there is a companion galaxy, 13 \u2032\u2032 NE, corresponding\nto a projected distance of \u223c 70 kpc (Pesce et al. 1995).\n1ES 0715-259 belongs to the Einstein Slew Survey (Elvis et al. 1992) and\nwas classified as a BL Lac Object by Perlman et al. (1996). They assumed\nthat a VLA radio source could be identified with the corresponding Slew Survey\nsource if it fell within 80\u2032\u2032 of X-ray position. However in this case they reported\nan offset in the radio-X position of >200 \u2032\u2032 . The VLA radio map of 1ES 0715-259\n(Perlman et al. 1996) shows a clear FR II morphology. The MMT spectrum\nobtained by Perlman et al.(1996) is featureless which motivated the BL Lacs\nclassification. The value of the ratio Fx /Fr (logFx /Fr =-5.18) places 1ES 0715259 near the borderline between RBL and XBL objects. There are no data of\npolarimetry for this source. HST (Urry et al. 2000) clearly resolved 1ES0715-259\ninto a point source surrounded by a small, rather elongated host galaxy.\nWe took an optical spectrum of the counterpart of the radio source. This\nshows clearly strong emission lines at \u03bb=7114.5 (EW=85.3 \u00c5), \u03bb=7262.4 \u00c5\n(EW= 14.3 \u00c5) and \u03bb=7332.0 \u00c5 (EW=46 \u00c5) (see figure 1). Identification\nrespectively with the H\u03b2 , [OIII] 4959 \u00c5 and [OIII] 5007 \u00c5 yields a redshift\nz=0.464\u00b10.001. The H\u03b2 luminosity ( LH\u03b2 =2.5 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121 ) is typical of\nradio loud quasar. On the basis of our optical spectroscopy and the radio properties we believe that this source is not a BL Lac but a radio loud quasar. The\nmis-identification by Perlman et al. (1996) is likely due to the very poor quality\nof their optical spectrum.\n2.2.\n\nLineless objects\n\nFor some relatively bright objects (V\u223c 15-16) despite the high signal to noise\n(S/N\u223c200) the spectra appear lineless. We report here two examples: PG1553+\n113 and PKS1722+119 (see figure 2).\nPG 1553+113 is a very bright optically selected source (Green et al. 1986)\nclassified as a BL Lacs on the basis of the featureless spectrum (Miller & Green\n1983) and the large optical variability (\u2206m\u2243 2 mag, Miller et al. 1988). Falomo\n& Treves (1990) showed that the emission feature in the UV region identified\nas Lyman-\u03b1 at z=0.36 by Miller & Green (1983) is spurious. Falomo & Treves\n(1990) did not find absorption features with an EW upper limit of 1 \u00c5.\nOur high signal to noise optical spectrum of the object confirms the absence\nof lines with a much lower of EW (\u223c0.1 \u00c5). The redshift of this source remains\nunknown. Assuming that it is hosted by a galaxy typical of BL Lacs (MR =-23.7\nRe =10 kpc, Urry et al. 2000) from our spectrum we set a lower limit of z>0.3\nconsistent with the fact that the source is unresolved in HST images (Urry et\n\n\fAPS Conf. Ser. Style\n\nFigure 1.\nLeft: The normalized spectrum of PKS0754+100. The two\nemission lines at z=0.266 are marked. Right: Spectrum of 1ES0715-259\nshowing clearly strong emission lines at z=0.464 of a typical QSO.\n\nFigure 2.\nThe normalized spectra of PG1553+113 (left) and\nPKS1722+119 (right). The spectra have S/N=200 and are lineless\n(EW<0.1 \u00c5).\n\n3\n\n\f4\n\nCarangelo et al.\n\nal. 2000).\nPKS1722+119 is a highly polarized X-ray selected BL Lac Object originally discovered by Uhuru. Griffith et al. (1989) claimed the observation of\nan absorption feature near 6000 \u00c5 which could be Na I (5892 \u00c5) redshifted\nat z=0.018. This was disproved by Brissenden et al. (1990) who obtained a\ncompletely lineless spectrum, consistently with more recently results by V\u00e8ron\nC\u00e8tty and V\u00e8ron 1993 and by Falomo et al. 1993.\nThe spectrum presented here (see fig. 2) is lineless and we can set a lower\nlimit of z>0.3. Also this source is unresolved by HST (Urry et al. 2000).\n2.3.\n\nMis-identified sources\n\nFrom the spectra examined so far we found two cases UM493 and 1620+103\nwhere we observe the typical stellar absorption lines of the Balmer series clearly\nindicating a wrong classification. Probably the mis-identifications (e.g.V\u00e8ronC\u00e8tty & V\u00e8ron 2001, Hewitt & Burbidge 1993) were due to the poor informations\non these sources, classification being based only on modest optical spectroscopy.\nOur high signal-to noise spectra clarify their nature and we can definitively\nclassify these sources as stars of spectral type A.\nReferences\nAbraham R.G., McHardy I.M., Crawford C.S. 1991, MNRAS, 252, 482\nAngel J.R.P. & Stockman H.S. 1980, ARA&A, 18, 321\nBrissenden R.J.V. et al. 1990, ApJ, 350, 578\nElvis M. et al. 1992, ApJS, 80, 257\nFalomo R. & Treves A. 1990, PASP, 102, 1120\nFalomo R. et al. 1993, ApJ, 411, L63\nFalomo R. 1996, MNRAS, 283, 241\nFalomo R. & Ulrich M-H 2000, A&A, 357, 91\nGreen R.F., Schmidt M. and Liebert J. 1986, ApJS, 61, 305\nGriffiths R.E. et al. 1989, MNRAS, 240, 33\nHewitt A. & Burbidge G., 1993, ApJS, 87, 451\nMiller H.R. and Green R.F. 1983, Bull.
